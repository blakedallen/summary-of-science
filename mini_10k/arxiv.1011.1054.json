Explosive progress in the field of cosmology\nover the past decade allowed for something that may well have been totally unanticipated in\nthe previous decades: the high-precision determination of several cosmological parameters.\nThis recent progress primarily clarifies the state of the Universe at redshifts z <\n\u223c few and\nexposes the relevant physics of the Universe traced back to the epoch of the decoupling\n3\nof the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at z <\n\u223c 10 . At the same time, these recent\nadvances also allow one to check for the consistency with one the building blocks of modern\ncosmology: big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). The agreement, or rather the lack of qualitative disagreement between cosmology in the z = 0 \u2212 103 interval and BBN at z \u223c 109 , is\nvery important, as it leads to the conclusion that the very early Universe was governed by\nthe same physical laws of nature as the current Universe and that it contained very similar\nif not identical particle content. Remarkably, that the transformations and the synthesis of\nlight elements in the expanding Universe occur with the active participation of all the interactions known to date: strong, weak, electromagnetic, and gravitational. It is well known\nthat even a mild modification of the standard conditions in the early Universe, at the time\nof BBN or in the subsequent evolution, may lead to observable deviations in primordial\nabundances. Thus, employing the precise determinations of the primordial abundances allows one to set limits or constrain various scenarios with deviations from General Relativity\nor from particle physics of the Standard Model (SM).\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\npospelov@uvic.ca\njpradler@perimeterinstitute.ca\n\n2\n\n\fBig Bang Nucleosynthesis as a Probe of New Physics\n\n3\n\nPrimordial nucleosynthesis is not the earliest cosmological epoch. It must have been\npreceded by an era in which a mechanism capable of producing the observed baryonantibaryon asymmetry of the Universe (baryogenesis) was operative. Moreover, a period\nof generation of nearly scale-invariant cosmological perturbations-for which the leading\ncandidate is inflation-had set the initial conditions from which the large-scale structure\nof the Universe evolved. Neither the cosmological timing nor the main \"players\" in inflation or baryogenesis-such as the inflaton, the right-handed neutrino, and so on-are\nknown with certainty. Although many successful models of this earliest epoch(s) exist, it\nis extremely difficult to directly test the associated physics in the laboratory. Thus, a multitude of baryogenesis- and inflationary scenarios may be viable. In contrast, BBN relies\non very well-studied pieces of physics, such as spectra and reactions of light elements and\ntheir weak decays. It involves almost no free parameters and occurs in a well-understood\nsequence of events in the early Universe. The consistency of BBN predictions with observations imposes an important calibration point on all new models of particle physics that\nrequire them to achieve some degree of \"normalcy\" before t = 1 s. This requirement places\npowerful constraints on many extensions of the SM.\nThe purpose of this review is to reveal different physical mechanisms by which new physics\ncan affect BBN and its light element abundance predictions, which have been extensively\ndiscussed in the literature for as long as the BBN theory has existed. In fact, one of the\nfirst papers on the subject by Alpher, Follin and Herman [1] points out that the nature of\nthe neutrino species (Dirac versus Majorana) affects the neutron-to-proton freeze-out ratio,\nn/p, and thereby the primordial helium abundance. Since then, a great deal of research\ndedicated to non-standard BBN scenarios has been performed, and a number of different\nways in which new physics can change the outcome of BBN have been identified. Here, we\npresent a non-technical review of many aspects related to these interesting possibilities.\nThe developments of the past decade also confirmed the conclusion that the SM is not\nthe ultimate theory. Important pieces of the puzzle come from cosmological observations\nsuggesting that the energy balance of the modern Universe is dominated by dark energy and\ndark matter. Is it possible that physics related to these mysterious substances interfered\nwith the sequence of events that ultimately led to the fusion of the primordial elements? Although there is no compelling evidence that this occurred, some new physics models related\nto particle dark matter may reduce the tension between data and the standard BBN theory\n(SBBN) prediction for the lithium isotopes. Even though the resolution of this tension may\nbe related to astrophysics, it is nevertheless intriguing to entertain the possibility that the\nrelics of the early Universe may hint at deviations from the SM. Future developments in\nastrophysics, cosmology, and particle physics may help to clarify this question.\n\n\f4\n\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis as a Probe of New Physics\n\n1.1\n\nUniverse at redshift of a billion: basic assumptions and main stages\nof BBN\n\nThe primary activity of BBN took place in the era associated with photon temperatures\nbetween T \u2243 few MeV and T \u2243 10 keV, in the cosmic time window t \u2243 (0.1 \u00f7 104 ) s, and\nmay be considered as a transition from a neutron-proton statistical equilibrium with no\nother nuclear species to a Universe with a significant presence of helium. BBN produced\nthe bulk of 4 He and D as well as good fractions of 3 He and 7 Li observed in the current\nUniverse. All the other elements are believed to be produced either by stars or by cosmic\nrays.\nWe begin by specifying the main assumptions on which SBBN theory rests:\n1. It is assumed that the Universe is spatially homogeneous and isotropic and that its\nenergy density is completely dominated by radiation so that physical distances scale\nas a(t) \u221d t1/2 . It is also assumed that the space-time geometry is flat with zero spatial\ncurvature. The theory of general relativity relates the expansion rate with the time\nelapsed since the big bang and with the energy density of the ambient cosmological\nfluid \u03c1:\n\u0227 p\n1\nH \u2261 = 8\u03c0GN \u03c1/3 \u2243 ,\n(1)\na\n2t\nwhere the energy density of the radiation-dominated Universe scales as \u03c1 \u223c a\u22124 \u223c T 4 ;\n18\n2 )\u22121 where M\nGN denotes Newton's constant GN = (8\u03c0MPl\nPl \u2243 2.43 \u00d7 10 GeV is\nthe reduced Planck mass. It is also assumed that the dark matter and dark energy\ncomponents of the Universe are \"well-behaved\", that is, that their contribution to the\nenergy density at the time of BBN is negligible.\n2. It is assumed that the initial temperature of the radiation-dominated epoch of the\nUniverse was well above the neutron-proton mass difference \u2206mnp = 1.293 MeV, so\nthat the initial conditions for the nuclear reaction framework are well specified:\n1\n(nn \u2243 np )|T \u226b\u2206mnp = nb .\n2\n\n(2)\n\nThe energy-momentum distribution of neutrons and protons is very close to being\nthermal. Moreover, a near-perfect spatial homogeneity for the distributions of neutrons and protons is assumed.\n3. It is assumed that the particle content and their interactions are given by that of\nthe SM and that by the time of BBN the baryon asymmetry was already present.\nThe energy density is completely dominated by photons and the three species of\nSM neutrinos (as well as electrons and positrons before their annihilation), whereas\nneutrons and protons carry only a negligible fraction of the total energy density. The\nstandard field content implies that there was an \"uneventful\" cosmological period\nbetween the time of BBN and the epoch of hydrogen recombination with electrons\nwhich implies that the baryon-to-entropy density ratio measured at the period of\n\n\fBig Bang Nucleosynthesis as a Probe of New Physics\n\n5\n\nCMB-\"formation\" directly translates into the one at BBN:\nnb\nnb\n(tBBN ) = (tCMB ).\ns\ns\n\n(3)\n\nIndeed, the measurements of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP)\nsatellite have allowed us to pinpoint the baryon density for a standard \u039bCDM cosmology, that is a flat Universe filled with baryons, cold dark matter, neutrinos and a\ncosmological constant, to an accuracy of better than 3% [2]. Expressed in terms of\nthe baryon-to-photon ratio,\n\u03b7b (tCMB ) =\n\nnb\n(tCMB ) = (6.23 \u00b1 0.17) \u00d7 10\u221210 ,\nn\u03b3\n\n(4)\n\nthis number provides a measure of the nucleon content of the Universe at BBN.\n4. Finally, it is assumed that the properties of particles and nuclei (masses, couplings,\nscattering cross sections and lifetimes) are identical between their current values and\ntheir values at tBBN . This condition, in fact, follows from the assumption of a minimal\nfield content, as hypothetical changing couplings and masses would necessitate new\nultra-soft scalar fields.\nIn many theories with non-standard cosmological or particle physics content, some of\nthese assumptions can be violated. For example, \"late decays\", that is, decays of metastable\nheavy particles during or after BBN can lead to energy injection into the primordial plasma\nand thus to temporary but strong departures from thermal equilibrium for some species.\nThe presence of the new relativistic degrees of freedom may affect the total energy density\nof the Universe, and, by modifying the Hubble expansion rate, may change the outcome\nof nuclear reactions. Before we consider such modifications in more detail, we remind the\nreader of the main components of the SBBN and briefly review its current observational\nstatus.\nSBBN theory, including the hits and misses of the original papers [3, 4, 5], is now well\nunderstood and described in detail in many text-books and reviews [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. SBBN\ncomprises the set of first-order differential Boltzmann equations on the abundances of the\ndifferent species,\ndYi X\ndYi\n= \u2212H(T )T\n=\n(\u0393ij Yj + \u0393ikl Yk Yl + ...),\ndt\ndT\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Yi = ni /nb are the time t (or temperature T )-dependent ratios between the number\ndensity ni and the baryon number density nb of light elements i = p, n, D,4 He, and so\non. The \u0393ij... represent generalized rates for element interconversion and decay that can\nbe determined in experiments and/or inferred from theoretical calculations. H(T ) is the\ntemperature-dependent Hubble expansion rate from Eq. (1).\nThe full form of the (non-integrated) Boltzmann equations should be given in terms of\nparticle distribution functions over energy and momenta. However, in practice, the system\nof equations (5), which assumes thermal distributions for nuclei, provides an excellent\n\n\f6\n\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis as a Probe of New Physics\n\napproximation because the frequent interactions with the numerous \u03b3s and e\u00b1 s in the\nplasma keep the light elements tightly coupled to the radiation field. The dependence of\nH(T ) on the temperature of the primordial plasma can be further specified:\nH(T ) = T\n\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n8\u03c0 3 g\u2217 GN\n90\n\n\u00131/2\n\n7\n, where g\u2217 = gboson + gf ermion ,\n8\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the gs denote the excited relativistic degrees of freedom. This expression needs to\nbe interpolated across the electron-positron annihilation epoch, in which the photon bath\nis heated with respect to the neutrino reservoir. The neutrinos maintain a quasi-thermal\nspectrum with temperature\nT\u03bd \u2243 (4/11)1/3 T,\n(7)\nin the approximation of full neutrino decoupling at the time of electron-positron annihilation\n[with small calculable corrections [11]]. Following e\u00b1 annihilation, the Hubble rate is given\nby H(T ) \u2243 T92 /(2 \u00d7 178 s), where T9 denotes the photon temperature T in units of 109 K.\nA number of well-developed integration codes, pioneered by Wagoner et al. [12], allow\none to solve the BBN system of equations numerically and to obtain the freeze-out values\nof the light elements. Also, good semi-analytic results can be obtained, see e.g. Ref. [13].\nThe code that we use for this review is based on that of Ref. [14]. Here we incorporate some\nsignificant improvements and updates; physical constants, isotope masses, and conversion\nfactors are determined from the evaluations [15, 16]. For all important SBBN reactions\n(i.e. up to A=7) we employ the results of [17] with the exceptions of the n(p, \u03b3)D and\n3 He(\u03b1, \u03b3)7 Be reactions for which we follow [18] and [19], respectively. To arrive at an\naccurate prediction of 4 He, we numerically integrate all weak rates at each time step for\nwhich zero temperature radiative corrections as well as relativistic Coulomb corrections\n(when applicable) are taken into account [20, 21]. Finally, as assessed in [20], we apply a\nslight upward-shift of 0.72% of the resulting 4 He abundance to account for more subtle,\nsubleading corrections to the BBN reaction network. We then find very good agreement\nbetween our light element-abundance predictions and those presented in [22] at the WMAP\nvalue (4) and with a neutron lifetime of \u03c4n = 885.7 s.\nFigure 1 shows the output of the SBBN reaction network. The evolution of all the main\nisotopes with A \u2264 7 is plotted as a function of time and temperature. Beginning from\nthe earliest times, the following sequence of events occurs: (a) the chemical decoupling of\nneutrinos from the thermal bath, (b) the annihilation of electrons and positrons, (c) the\nfreeze-out of neutrons and protons, (d) an \"intermission\" between the n/p freeze-out and\nthe deuteron ignition at the end of the \"bottleneck,\" (e) helium synthesis at T9 \u2243 0.85\n(70 keV), and finally (f) a follow-up stage in which the main nuclear reactions gradually\ndrop out of equilibrium and the abundances of all light elements freeze out. The freeze-out\nabundances are given by the horizontal lines on the right-hand side of the graph. Although\nsome neutrons are still generated by residual deuterium (D) fusion below T9 \u223c 0.1 (10 keV),\nthey are too few in number to cause any further change in the elemental abundances.\n\n\f7\n\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis as a Probe of New Physics\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\nH\n\n1\n\n10\u22126\n\n\u03bd dec.\n\n104\n\n105\n\n106\n\nD b.n.\nYp\n\nN\n\n10\u22122\n10\u22124\n\n10\n\nt/sec\n100\n1000\n\nSBBN f.o.\n\nn/p dec.\n\nD/H\n\ne\u00b1 ann.\n\n3\n\nHe/H\nT/H\n\n10\u22128\n\n7\n\n10\u221210\n\nBe/H\n\n7\n\nLi/H\n\n6\n\nLi/H\n\n10\u221212\n10\u221214\n1000\n\n100\nT /keV\n\n10\n\n1\n\nFigure 1: Time and temperature evolution of all standard big bang nucleosynthesis (SBBN)relevant nuclear abundances. The vertical arrow indicates the moment at T9 \u2243 0.85 at\nwhich most of the helium nuclei are synthesized. The gray vertical bands indicate main\nBBN stages. From left to right: neutrino decoupling, electron-positron annihilation and n/p\nfreeze-out, D bottleneck, and freeze-out of all nuclear reactions. Protons (H) and neutrons\n(N) are given relative to nb whereas Yp denotes the 4 He mass fraction.\nBelow we discuss the fusion of the light elements and compare their SBBN predictions with\nobservations.\n1.1.1 O(0.1) abundances: 4 He. The beauty of the SBBN prediction for 4 He lies in\nits simplicity. Only a few factors that determine it. The rates for weak scattering processes\nthat inter-convert n \u2194 p at high plasma temperatures scale as G2F T 5 , where GF is the\nFermi constant. As the Universe cools, these rates drop below the T 2 -proportional Hubble\nrate H(T ) Eq. (6). The neutron-to-proton transitions slow down, and the ratio of their\nrespective number densities cannot follow its chemical-equilibrium exponential dependence,\nn/p|eq \u2243 exp(\u2212\u2206mnp /T ). Around T \u2243 0.7 MeV this dependence freezes out to n/p \u2243\n1/6 but continues to decrease slowly due to residual scattering and \u03b2-decays of neutrons.\nThe formation of D during this intermission period is delayed by its photo-dissociation\nprocess that occurs efficiently because of the overwhelmingly large number of photons [see\n\n\f8\n\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis as a Probe of New Physics\n\nEq. (4)] with energies in excess of the deuteron binding energy Ed = 2.22 MeV. Once the\ntemperature drops to T9 \u2243 0.85, the exponential Boltzmann suppression of such photons\nis sufficient to build a number density in D that is large enough to ignite other nuclear\nreactions. At these temperatures, the neutron-to-proton ratio has dropped to approximately\n1/7 and very quickly, all neutrons are consumed and are incorporated into 4 He nuclei that\nhave the highest binding energy per nucleon among all isotopes lighter than carbon. Thus,\nto a rather good accuracy,\n2n/p\n.\n(8)\nYp \u2243\n1 + n/p T9 \u22430.85\nThe 4 He mass fraction Yp is very weakly dependent on \u03b7b as well as on the precise values\nfor almost all nuclear reaction rates. Instead, Yp is sensitive on the timing of major BBN\nevents, such as the neutron-to-proton freeze-out and the end-point of the D bottleneck.\nConsequently, the prediction for Yp relies on such well-measured quantities as the Newton\nconstant, the neutron-proton mass difference, the Fermi constant, the neutron lifetime and\nthe deuteron binding energy. The sensitivity of 4 He to all possible non-standard scenarios\nthat modify the timing of BBN events causes this isotope to serve as the BBN \"chronometer\" [9]. SBBN predicts Yp with an impressive precision (much better than 1%) so that the\nerror bar is dominated by the uncertainty in the neutron lifetime.\nThe determination of primordial 4 He has been carried out by several groups [23, 24].\nSuch determination is performed via observations of hydrogen- and helium-emission lines\nin extragalactic HII-regions of low metallicity. Although the statistical error on Yp -due to\na large number of such observations-can be driven down to a O(10\u22123 )-level, the extraction\nof the primordial value is limited by systematic errors [25]. Indeed, the latter errors are\nmuch larger than both, the statistical error and the accuracy of the SBBN prediction.\nWe quote the most conservative analysis by Olive & Skillman [25], together with a recent\nupdate on the SBBN prediction [22],\nSBBN :\nextrapolation to primordial value :\n\nYp = 0.2486 \u00b1 0.0002\nYp = 0.249 \u00b1 0.009.\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\nAnother recent analysis [26] finds a somewhat smaller error bar, Yp \u2243 0.250 \u00b1 0.004, and for\nthe purpose of this review we assume that the observational range for Yp is limited to the\nrange between 0.24 and 0.26. Clearly this error range is one of the most important issues\nin the application of BBN to particle physics, as it translates directly into the tightness of\nconstraints on many non-standard scenarios. Further progress in understanding the error\nbudget in the extraction of the primordial value of Yp is needed.\n1.1.2 O(10\u22125 ) abundances: D and 3 He.\nRapid formation of D at T9 \u223c 1 is counterbalanced by the uptake of helium producing reactions. Below T9 \u223c 0.8 the neutron-supply\nfor D quickly drops in abundance, producing a characteristic peak in the D/H ratio as a\nfunction of temperature, Figure 1. The near complete burning of D then results in a rather\nsmall freeze-out value on the order of few\u00d710\u22125 . Likewise, 3 He has a similar abundance to\n\n\f9\n\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis as a Probe of New Physics\n\nD. BBN predictions for both elements are very sensitive to nuclear reaction rates as well as\nto the \u03b7b -input. Nuclear reaction rates relevant for the formation of 3 He and D have been\nwell measured to better than 10% accuracy. Therefore, by use of the current WMAP input,\nSBBN can make a fairly precise prediction for the abundances of these elements [22]:\nSBBN :\n\nD/H = 2.49 \u00b1 0.17 \u00d7 10\u22125\n\n(11)\n\nSBBN :\n\n3\n\n(12)\n\nHe/H = (1.00 \u00b1 0.07) \u00d7 10\u22125 .\n\nD can be observed in the local Universe as well as in highly redshifted clouds at low\nmetallicities. The latter, see Refs. [27, 28, 29, 30, 31], is the preferred way of determining its\nprimordial fraction. The observations of D absorption lines in quasar absorption systems\n(QALS) is challenging given that only a tiny isotopic shift separates the D line from the\nmain hydrogen line. Only in a few cases of QALS with sufficiently simple velocity structure\nhas the D/H ratio been extracted. The scatter of those resulting D/H determinations poses\na certain problem because it exceeds the naively averaged error bar. Artificially inflating\nthe errors in order to account for this scatter produces the following result [31]:\nQALS observations :\n\nD\n= (2.82 \u00b1 0.21) \u00d7 10\u22125 .\nH\n\n(13)\n\nThis range agrees remarkably well with the SBBN prediction using the WMAP \u03b7b -input.\nDespite the agreement one should be apprehensive of two potential problems. First, the\ngalactic evolution of deuterium presents astronomers with a number of puzzles and implies\nsome significant degree of absorption of D onto dust grains (For recent discussions, see\nfor instance [32, 33]). Do similar mechanisms exist at QALS, and if so, should they result\nin an upward correction to Eq. (13) that would reflect the true primordial value of D/H?\nSecond, the origin of scatter in the QALS data is not explained and could be a sign of\nunderestimated systematic errors or additional depletion mechanisms. Until these issues\nare better understood, primordial values as high as 4 \u00d7 10\u22125 cannot be convincingly ruled\nout.\nUnlike D, which can be depleted only in the course of the galactic evolution, both production and depletion of 3 He may occur; therefore, a direct interpretation of 3 He/H measurements as primordial is not possible. However, given the uni-directional evolution of D,\none can conclude that the 3 He/D ratio will only grow thereby providing us with a very\nimportant upper bound on the primordial 3 He/D ratio [34]. For the purpose of this review,\nthe primordial ratio can be constrained as [35]\nobservational bound :\n\n3 He\n\nD\n\n< 1,\n\n(14)\n\nwhich does not challenge SBBN, but rather represents an important constraint on nonstandard BBN scenarios.\n1.1.3 O(10\u221210 ) abundances: 7 Li. The formation of A = 6, 7 nuclei is suppressed in\nSBBN due to the absence of stable A = 5 elements. Tritium-\u03b1 and 3 He-\u03b1 fusion generates\n7 Li and 7 Be nuclei, but with rates that are much smaller than the Hubble expansion rate.\n\n\f10\n\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis as a Probe of New Physics\n\nConsequently, only a tiny number, few\u00d710\u221210 of 7 Li and 7 Be nuclei relative to hydrogen\nis generated. At a later stage of cosmological evolution 7 Be is ultimately converted into\n7 Li via electron capture. At the WMAP-measured value of the baryon-to-photon ratio \u03b7 ,\nb\nmore than 90% of the primordial lithium is produced in the form of 7 Be in the radiative\ncapture process, 4 He+3 He\u21927 Be+\u03b3. The output of 7 Be is almost linearly dependent on the\ncorresponding S-factor for this reaction, which was recently re-measured by several groups\n[36, 37, 38]. The current \u223c15% accuracy prediction for the combined 7 Be+7 Li abundance\nstands at [22]\n7 Li\n\u221210\nSBBN :\n= 5.24+0.71\n.\n(15)\n\u22120.67 \u00d7 10\nH\nThe discrepancy between this prediction and observations is often referred to as the lithium\nproblem.\nDue to its very low abundance, lithium cannot be determined from observations of extragalactic absorption clouds. Instead, all observations of the 7 Li/H ratio must be performed\nin the atmospheres of low-metallicity galactic halo stars. The near constancy of 7 Li/H ratios\nat a low- but wide range of metallicities and for some range of effective stellar temperature\nis called the \"Spite plateau\". For a long time this plateau was thought to be an accurate\nrepresentation of the primordial lithium abundance. A rather small scatter along the Spite\nplateau supports the interpretation of the measured 7 Li values as primordial. Although\nthere have been numerous determinations of the 7 Li abundance on the Spite plateau, the\nmost recent observations seem to indicate some metallicity-dependence of the 7 Li abundance. Furthermore, scatter may not be negligible, but rather may favor some amount of\nstellar 7 Li depletion [39, 40]. Currently, the observational status of the primordial lithium\nabundance is given by [41, 42]\nSpite plateau value :\n\n7 Li\n\nH\n\n\u221210\n= 1.23+0.34\n,\n\u22120.16 \u00d7 10\n\n(16)\n\nwhich is a factor of three to five lower than the SBBN-predicted amount of primordial\nlithium, Eq. (15). It is important to keep in mind that measurements of lithium in globular\nclusters have resulted in somewhat higher abundances of (2.19\u00b10.28)\u00d710\u221210 [42] (for other\nobservational determinations of the 7 Li abundance consistent with [41,42] see [43,44]). The\nexplanation of the discrepancy between (15) and (16) could be of purely astrophysical\norigin. [A potential additional depletion of SBBN values would require some un-orthodox\nmodifications of secondary 7 Be-destroying reactions [45, 46]-but so far this possibility has\nnot found support from nuclear experiments [47]]. Atmospheric 7 Li may have been partially\ndepleted from atmospheres of population II stars due to additional settling mechanisms.\nAlso, it has been suggested that stellar models that assume a factor \u2248 2 suppression of\n7 Li in such stars, are consistent with observations of other abundances [48, 49]. Finally,\nit is also conceivable that the lithium problem points directly towards physics beyond the\nSBBN model, perhaps related to new physical processes at T9 \u223c 0.5. Unfortunately, given\nthe controversial status of 7 Li it is difficult to use this isotope for constraining models of\n\n\f11\n\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis as a Probe of New Physics\n\nnew physics that modify its abundance. Instead, we point to certain interesting new physics\npossibilities that might be responsible for the reduction of 7 Li/H.\n1.1.4 O(10\u221214 ) and less abundances: 6 Li and A \u2265 9 elements.\nstable A = 6 element. The main SBBN reaction that produces it,\n4\n\nHe + D \u2192 6 Li + \u03b3,\n\nQ = 1.47MeV,\n\n6 Li\n\nis the only\n\n(17)\n\nis suppressed by four orders of magnitude relative to other radiative capture reactions such\nas 4 He+T \u2192 7 Li+\u03b3, and is suppressed by approximately seven to eight orders of magnitude\nrelative to other photonless nuclear rates. The reason for the extra suppression is unique\nas it arises from almost the same charge-to-mass ratio for 4 He and D, which inhibits the E1\ntransition, thereby making this radiative capture extremely inefficient. At the same time,\nthe proton reaction that destroys 6 Li is very fast which leads to a O(10\u221214 )-level prediction\nfor primordial 6 Li. This is well below modern detection capabilities. Heavier elements with\nA \u2265 9 such as 9 Be, 10 B and 11 B are never produced in significant quantities in the SBBN\nframework because of the absence of stable A = 8 nuclei, as 8 Be is under-bound by 92 keV\nand decays to two \u03b1 particles.\nDetections of 9 Be, 10 B, and 11 B have been made for many stars at low metallicities and are\nnot controversial. Observations of 9 Be [50,51] are far above the O(10\u221218 ) SBBN prediction\nand exhibit a linear correlation with oxygen, clearly indicating its secondary (spallation)\norigin [52]. The lowest level of detected 9 Be/H is at \u223c few\u00d710\u221214 , which translates into\na limit on the primordial fraction of 2 \u00d7 10\u221213 [53], assuming that there is no significant\ndepletion of 9 Be in stellar atmospheres.\nBecause SBBN predicts very low 6 Li abundances, it is usually assumed that the origin of\nthis isotope is not associated with BBN. Conversely, any level of 6 Li detection in stars at low\nmetallicity in excess of O(10\u221212 ) is of interest for the test of both the SBBN framework and\nthe galactic chemical evolution models. Remarkably, the existence of a 6 Li plateau at an\nisotopic ratio of 6 Li/7 Li \u2243 0.05 has been claimed from (2\u03c3) detections in approximately \u223c 10\nlow-metallicity stars [44]. This level of 6 Li/7 Li should be considered high as it cannot be\nexplained by cosmic ray production at such low metallicities [54]. However, in the thermal\nenvironment of stellar atmospheres the absorption lines of 7 Li and 6 Li are blended together\nso that observations become extremely challenging. Indeed, recent works [55] have claimed\nthat additional convective motion in stellar atmospheres may lead to an 6 Li-unrelated\ndistortion of 7 Li absorption lines which could be confused with positive 6 Li-detections. The\nanalysis by Cayrel et al. [55] favors the latter explanation and sets a number of upper limits\non the 6 Li/7 Li in several stars of interest.\nWe now move to the main topic of our paper: modification of BBN by new physics.\nInstead of concentrating on very specific models of particle physics and/or gravitation, we\nreview different classes of models that modify or abandon the main assumptions of SBBN\nlisted in the Introduction.\n\n\f12\n\n2\n\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis as a Probe of New Physics\n\nNEW PHYSICS AFFECTING THE TIMING OF MAIN BBN EVENTS\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, most neutrons are incorporated into 4 He at a very specific moment:\nthe end of the D bottleneck. The amount of helium and deuterium that results has a strong\ndependence on the n/p ratio that, in turn, translates into a sensitivity to a much earlier\nevent in the BBN history: the freeze-out of neutron-to-proton interconversion. Different\nphysical processes may affect the timing of both events and thereby change the BBN output.\n\n2.1\n\nBBN with new degrees of freedom\n\nA classic application of BBN consists of constraining the number of the excited relativistic\ndegrees of freedom. Traditionally, this procedure is formulated in terms of a constraint on\nthe effective number of neutrino species, N\u03bd,eff . To be more general, we re-formulate such\na bound as a limit on the amount of so-called \"dark radiation\", \u03c1dr . By dark radiation we\nmean extra massless or nearly-massless degrees of freedom that have the expected scaling as\nthe Universe expands, \u03c1dr \u223c a\u22124 . Furthermore, we assume that this additional relativistic\ncomponent is totally \"passive\" and that it does not exchange energy with any SM species.\nThis viewpoint can then be easily applied to the thermally decoupled extra bosonic or\nfermionic degrees of freedom. The addition of dark radiation to the cosmic energy budget\namplifies the Hubble expansion rate,\np\n(18)\nHSBBN \u2192 H = HSBBN 1 + \u03c1dr /\u03c1SM ,\nleading to an earlier freeze-out of the n/p ratio and thus to a larger helium mass fraction.\nIn this formula, \u03c1SM and HSBBN are the SBBN energy density and the Hubble rate, respectively. Figure 2 illustrates the changes to the abundances of helium, deuterium and\nlithium as a function of \u03c1dr /\u03c1SM and shows that even the somewhat generous assumption\non the error bar of Yp translates into a rather tight constraint on \u03c1dr . One cannot achieve\nany significant degree of 7 Li suppression without violating other bounds. Figure 2 formally\nextends to the region of negative \u03c1dr . This may seem unphysical, but a negative \u03c1dr effect\ncan be mimicked by models with decreased neutrino temperatures due to, for instance,\nadditional electromagnetic energy injection at approximately T \u223c 2 MeV. Assuming that\n4 He is limited to the range between 0.24 and 0.26, one arrives at the conclusion that\n\u03c1dr\n< 0.14.\n(19)\n\u2212 0.06 <\n\u03c1SM\n\n<\nPresented in a traditional way, this constraint corresponds to 2.6 <\n\u223c N\u03bd,eff \u223c 4.\nThe constraint on \u03c1dr can be further specified to models at hand. It can be applied to\nlimit the energy density carried by very light and thermally decoupled scalar fields. For\nexample, if the dark energy sector at the time of BBN corresponds to a very light classical\nscalar field \u03c6 that tracks \u03c1SM [56, 57], Eq. (19) constrains the parameters of the potential,\nV (\u03c6). For an exponential potential of the form V (\u03c6) = M 4 exp{\u2212\u03bb\u03c6/MP l }, the energy\ndensity carried by the tracker field is \u03c1\u03c6 /\u03c1total = 4/\u03bb2 , so that the magnitude of \u03bb should\nbe larger approximately five so as to satisfy (19).\n\n\f13\n\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis as a Probe of New Physics\n0.8\n\n0.24 < Yp < 0.26\n\n0.6\n\nD\n\n\u2206Y /YSBBN\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n-0.2\n\n4\n\nHe\n\n3\n\nHe\nH\n\n3\n\nHe\n\n4\n\nHe\n\n7\n\nLi\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.6\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n\u2206\u03c1SM /\u03c1SM (T < 0.1 MeV)\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFigure 2: Change of nuclear abundances relative to their SBBN values as a function of the\n\"dark radiation\" component \u03c1dr /\u03c1SM = \u2206\u03c1SM /\u03c1SM . The vertical band shows the allowed\namount of dark radiation that keeps Yp in the 0.24 \u00f7 0.26 window.\nThe result (19) can also be developed further into constraints on the properties of the\ndark radiation fields and the temperature of their thermal decoupling from the SM field\ncontent. Suppose that the dark radiation sector contains N bosonic light neutral fields that\nare connected to the SM via some heavy \u039bn -scale suppressed operators of dimension n > 4.\nThen, the thermalization rate of dark radiation with the SM particles would typically scale\nas \u0393th \u223c T (T /\u039bn )2(n\u22124) . The temperature of thermal decoupling is given by the condition\nH(Td ) \u223c \u0393th . Therefore, for every given N that threatens to violate the bound of Eq. (19)\none can determine a minimal decoupling temperature, and for any given n place a lower\nbound on the high-energy scale \u039bn . For example, if N \u2265 3, then the thermal decoupling\nof these species must occur around the quantum chromodynamics hadronization epoch\n(T \u223c 200 MeV) or earlier. By comparing the Hubble rate with the thermalization rates at\nthat epoch, one arrives at\nN \u2265 3 \u21d2 \u039b5 > 5 \u00d7 108 GeV; \u039b6 > 5 TeV.\n\n(20)\n\nIf the interaction is mediated by dimension five operators then the sensitivity to the \u039b\nscale can extend very far-indeed, much beyond directly accessible energy scales in collider\nexperiments. In exactly the same way, one can constrain properties and interactions of\nright-handed neutrinos, should they be light. For example, Eq. (19) can be used to set\n\n\f14\n\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis as a Probe of New Physics\n\nlimits on the strength of the coupling between left- and right-handed neutrino species.\nFinally, even if the right-handed neutrinos are heavy and not excited, BBN allows one\nto constrain non-standard properties of the left-handed neutrino species. For example,\na sizable magnetic moment or charge radius of neutrinos (that correspond to dimension\nfive and six effective interactions with the external electromagnetic current) may be strong\nenough to prolong the thermal coupling of neutrinos to the electron-positron-photon fluid,\nthereby leading to essentially higher T\u03bd than predicted by the standard scenario (7). More\ndiscussions on the status of BBN with extra degrees of freedom can be found in earlier\nreviews [6, 7, 8, 9].\n\n2.2\n\nBBN with sliding couplings and mass scales.\n\nAn alternative, and more exotic way to affect the timing of main BBN events is realized\nin models that predict a time evolution of coupling constants and mass scales. A tractable\nversion of such models represents a Brans-Dicke-type scalar field that couples to the SM\n2 and m q\u0304q where m is a quark mass. The evolution of the scalar field creates\noperators F\u03bc\u03bd\nq\nq\nthe effect of changing mq , electric charge, \u039bQCD , Higgs vacuum expectation value, and\nso forth. These changes, in turn, induce changes in the reaction rates, nuclear binding,\nand the position of resonances. Much effort has been devoted to calculations that make\nsuch connections explicit [58, 59]. Several works have addressed the question of coupling\nvariability in connection to BBN; for the most recent accounts, we refer the reader to, for\ninstance [60, 61, 62, 63].\nRather than delve into the intricacies of coupling and the scale dependence of nuclear\nparameters, we limit ourselves to the following simplified framework. We assume that\nthe primary effect of the change of couplings is on the value of the neutron-proton mass\ndifference \u2206mnp and on the deuteron binding energy Ed . We disregard other possible\nchanges, i.e. in the Coulomb barrier penetration, shifts in the position of nuclear resonances\netc. Such an approximation is somewhat justified because both, \u2206mnp and Ed , enter in the\nexponents that control (a) the n/p ratio around its freeze-out time and (b) the D abundance\naround the end of the bottleneck. By using this approach, we are certain to capture the\nmain effects related to the change of couplings because \u2206mnp influences the n/p freeze-out\nand the value of Ed dictates the end of the D bottleneck. Moreover, the deuteron binding\nenergy is among the most sensitive nuclear parameters to the variation of mq /\u039bQCD due to\na strong cancellation of mq -dependent against mq -independent components in the deuteron\nbinding energy [61].\nFigure 3 shows contours of D, 4 He and 7 Li abundances in the \u2206mnp \u2013Ed plane when both\nvariations are implemented simultaneously. The abundances of elements are very sensitive\nto the variations of these quantities: helium in particular is extremely sensitive to \u2206mnp .\nMoreover, among all elements, lithium appears to be the most sensitive to the variation of\nthe deuteron binding energy because for smaller values of Ed , the end of the D bottleneck is\ndelayed, and the 3 He(\u03b1, \u03b3)7 Be reaction is even less efficient than in SBBN.

The 5-10% downward change in Eb can significantly reduce 7 Li abundance.\nof suppressing the lithium abundance while maintaining the agreement with helium and\ndeuterium was noted in recent papers [61, 62, 63]. A rather strong sensitivity of Ed to the\nmq /\u039bQCD parameter ensures that even a small variation of the latter leads to a drastic\nchange in lithium.\n\n3\n\nNON-EQUILIBRIUM BBN\n\nOne of the main assumptions of standard BBN is that all reactions occur between partners\nthat are perfectly thermalized with the photon background fluid. However, even the standard nuclear processes that occur during BBN lead to a non-thermal energy component\nwhich is released when mass is converted into nuclear binding energy. It is easy to estimate\nhow much of this energy is injected. Because the total binding energy of helium is 28 MeV,\nthe total energy release is just under 2 MeV per nucleon. Although such an energy injection\nis noticeable when it occurs later in the history of the Universe, the release of such energy\nat T9 = 0.85 does not lead to a change in SBBN predictions (for an analysis of some SBBN\nnon-equilibrium reactions see Ref. [64]).\nMore drastically, non-standard decaying or annihilating particles can also increase the\nenergy release per nucleon. Indeed, if this occurs predominantly after nucleosynthesis is\n\n\f16\n\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis as a Probe of New Physics\n\ncomplete it can lead to strong departures from the observed pattern of primordial abundances. Therefore, BBN provides us with a significant sensitivity to this class of models\neven when the total energy density stored in the decaying and annihilating species is completely subdominant to the energy density of the Universe. This issue has taken on a great\ndeal of importance due to its potential connection to particle dark matter, in which weakly\ninteracting massive particles (WIMPs) can either source non-equilibrium BBN via their\nannihilation, or be produced in the decays of some metastable parent particles.\nBBN scenarios with additional energy injection have received a plenty of attention since\ntheir inception [65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72], more recent and more detailed treatments can be\nfound in [73,74,75,76,77]. By accounting for the qualitative differences in the abundance signatures, one may distinguish between electromagnetic decays to \u03b3s, e\u00b1 , and possibly other\nleptons and decays to hadronic final states that lead to extra energetic nucleons. Whereas\n5\nelectromagnetic decays have a significant impact on BBN only at late times (\u03c4 >\n\u223c 10 s), after\nall reactions are effectively frozen, the hadronic decays may have observable consequences\neven if they occur as early as few seconds.\n\n3.1\n\nBBN with electromagnetic and hadronic energy injection\n\nWhen the decaying particle produces mostly electromagnetic radiation, the treatment of\nnon-equilibrium BBN is relatively simple. Because the density of the early Universe is\nquite significant, decaying particles quickly yield electromagnetic showers. As a result, a\npotentially very large energy release per decaying particle (i.e. O(1 TeV) can be transferred\nto a large number of O(10 MeV)-energy photons, some of which may have a chance of\ninteracting with and/or disintegrating light nuclei before their energy is further dispersed\nand thermalized.\nThe main physical process that regulates the maximal energy of particles in the shower\nis the pair-production in the scattering of energetic \u03b3s on thermal photons, i.e. \u03b3 + \u03b3T \u2192\ne\u2212 + e+ . This leads to a so-called \"zeroth-generation\" differential photon spectrum in the\nform of a broken power law [78]:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nK (E /E )\u22121.5 for E\u03b3 < Elow\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 0 \u03b3 low\n(21)\np\u03b3 (E\u03b3 ) = K0 (E\u03b3 /Elow )\u22122.0 for Elow < E\u03b3 < EC\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0\nfor E\u03b3 > EC\n\nwhere the power break occurs at Elow \u2243 m2e /(80T ), and the spectrum is cut-off at the\nthreshold of pair production EC \u2243 m2e /22T [72]. The overall normalization constant K0 of\nthe spectrum is determined by requiring that the primary injected (electromagnetic) energy\nR\nE0 be carried by the photon cascade, that is, E0 = dE\u03b3 E\u03b3 p\u03b3 .\nThe ansatz (21) for the spectrum immediately tells us the temperature and time of injection that allow for the photodisintegration of a certain element.

An amount of 6 Li can be produced either via\nphotodissociation of 7 Be and 7 Li or through secondary interactions of the products of 4 He\ndestruction. This important mechanism is discussed in some detail later.\nThe photons in the cascade (21) undergo further degradation via the (slower) processes\nof Compton scattering, pair-production on nuclei, and elastic \u03b3-\u03b3 scattering so that the\ntotal number of energetic photons is given by competition between the injection (decay or\nannihilation) rate \u0393inj and the total energy loss rate \u0393\u03b3 (E\u03b3 ). The energy spectrum can\nthen be obtained in form of a quasi-static equilibrium solution [79]\nf\u03b3qse = nX\n\n\u0393inj p\u03b3 (E\u03b3 )\n,\n\u0393\u03b3 (E\u03b3 )\n\n(23)\n\nwhere nX is the time-dependent number density of the decaying and annihilating particles,\n\u22121\nfor decays, and \u0393inj = 21 nX h\u03c3ann vi for self-annihilation. Depending on the\n\u0393inj = \u03c4X\ntemperature of the primordial plasma at the time of energy injection, both production\nand destruction of elements may occur.

One can see the significant increase in 3 He, D, and 6 Li abundances. The\nsolid arrows indicate the main transformations of the elemental abundances under the influence of the dissociating radiation. The model considered in this graph is in stark conflict\nwith observations and is therefore excluded.\nIt is intriguing to investigate whether the injection of electromagnetic energy may reduce\nthe abundance of 7 Li+7 Be. A dedicated study [80] found that such a reduction is generally\ndifficult to achieve because either D is also destroyed or 3 He/D is overproduced beyond\n\n\f18\n\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis as a Probe of New Physics\n\n1\nYp\n3\n\n( He+T)/H\n\n10\u22122\n\nD/H\n\nX\n\n10\u22124\n10\u22126\n10\u22128\n\nN\n\n6\n\n10\u221210\n\nLi/H\n\n(7 Li+7 Be)/H\n\n10\u221212\n6\n\n10\u221214\n100\n\n10\n\nLi/H|sec\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n\nT /keV\nFigure 4: Consequences of late decays of a heavy 1 TeV mass particle X that releases half of\nits rest mass in the form of electromagnetic energy.

Although the overall conclusion is negative, i.e. the\nelectromagnetic destruction of 7 Li is problematic, we stress that \"just-so\" solutions can\nalways be found. For example, consider a relatively light but abundant neutral particle with\nmass m in the narrow range between \u223c 3.5 and 4.5 MeV. 7 Be could indeed be destroyed\nwhile D, 3 He, and 6 Li remain unaffected because the maximum released energy, m/2, lies\nbelow their photo-disintegration threshold.\nThe treatment of energy injection via hadronic channels is significantly more complicated\nbecause additional effects must be taken into account. Partons emitted in a decay or\nannihilation are quickly hadronized and the highly energetic fragmentation products [mostly\npions but also (anti-)nucleons] are released into the plasma. Only long-lived mesons-\nnamely, charged pions (\u03c0 \u00b1 ) and kaons (K \u00b1 , KL0 )-with lifetimes of O(10\u22128 s) have a chance\nto interact with background nuclei before decaying. A very early hadronic energy injection\n<\n(300 keV <\n\u223c T \u223c 1 MeV) allows the \u03c0-mesons to participate in charge exchange reactions,\n\u03c0 \u2212 + p \u2192 \u03c0 0 + n. Such reactions lead to a higher n/p freeze-out value, thereby increasing\nthe helium mass fraction Yp . Similar effects can be caused by anti-nucleons, which tend\n\n\fBig Bang Nucleosynthesis as a Probe of New Physics\n\n19\n\nto annihilate predominantly on protons. The most important difference with respect to\nelectromagnetic energy releases comes from the injection of energetic nucleons after the\nformation of 4 He. The propagation of energetic nucleons through the primordial plasma\ncauses spallation processes on 4 He. Reactions caused by energetic nucleons-n + 4 He \u2192\nT + p + n, n + 4 He \u2192 D + p + 2n and others-in turn generate energetic A = 3 elements\nthat can participate in endo-thermic nuclear reactions that are forbidden in SBBN.\nWhat determines the efficiency of spallation processes and of subsequent secondary nonthermal reactions is the rate at which the energetic charged nuclei and neutrons are stopped\nby the primordial plasma. The dominant thermalization processes for charged nuclei are\nCoulomb interactions with e\u00b1 and Thomson scattering off thermal photons. Below the e+ e\u2212\nannihilation threshold the stopping power of the plasma rapidly drops with temperature,\nreaching its minimum at approximately T \u2243 20 keV. The energy loss of the neutrons\ninitially occurs via its magnetic-moment interaction with electrons and positrons. At later\nstages (T <\n\u223c 80 keV), neutrons loose their energy dominantly by scattering on protons and\n4 He.\nThe resulting constraints on energy injection are described in great detail elsewhere\n[73, 74, 75, 76, 77]. BBN results are most sensitive to the energy injection after 108 s, where\nconstraints as strong as \u223c 1 MeV per nucleon result from the secondary 6 Li production, and\ndo not generally depend on the branching ratio to hadrons. Constraints on electromagnetic\nenergy injection depend, to a large extend, on whether 4 He can be photo-dissociated, and\nthey become much weaker if energy is released when the temperature is above 0.6 keV.\nHadronic decays allow one to probe much earlier times. For fully hadronic decays to\nenergetic q q\u0304 pairs, similar sensitivity (1 MeV per nucleon) applies to injection at much\nearlier times, specifically t \u223c 104 s. Perhaps one of the most interesting features of energy\ninjection with nucleons in the final state is the effect of extra neutrons at T \u223c 40 keV, which\nmay lead to an important depletion of the total lithium abundance.\n3.1.1 Neutron excess at 40 keV and suppression of 7 Li. An interesting aspect\nof non-thermal BBN with hadronic decays and annihilations is the possibility of alleviating\nthe tension between the Spite plateau value and the predicted abundance of 7 Li, e.g. \"solve\nthe 7 Li problem\". In SBBN the 7 Be abundance is controlled by the 3 He + 4 He \u2192 7 Be + \u03b3\nreaction and by the combination of the two reactions that destroy it:\nn + 7 Be \u2192 p + 7 Li;\n\np + 7 Li \u2192 4 He + 4 He .\n\n(25)\n\n>\nThe increase of neutrons in a narrow temperature interval 60 keV >\n\u223c T \u223c 30 keV (in other\n7\nwords, during or just after Be synthesis) may amplify the efficiency of this destruction.\n\u22125 neutrons per baryon, regardless the microscopic cause of such an\nThe injection of >\n\u223c 10\ninjection, may enhance 7 Be\u21927 Li and lead to an overall depletion of 7 Be+7 Li [68,73]. When\nthe temperature drops below 30 keV, the 7 Li burning reaction drops out of equilibrium,\nthe lithium destruction stops, and the supply of \"extra neutrons\" has no further effects\non the overall 7 Be+7 Li abundance. At the same time, most of the extra neutrons injected\naround the time of BBN are removed by the radiative recombination with protons leading\n\n\f20\n\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis as a Probe of New Physics\n\n1\n\nYp\n\n10\u22122\nD/H\n\n10\u22124\n10\u22126\n10\u22128\n\nN\n7\n\n10\u221210\n10\u221212\n10\u221214\n100\n\n7\n\nLi/H\n\nBe/H\n\nN src.\nSBBN\n10\nT /keV\n\n1\n\nFigure 5: Effects on element abundances in response to an elevated (thermal) neutron\ncontent, sourced by a decaying species, at early times. Although neutrons are mostly\nincorporated into D, they also transfer 7 Be nuclei into the 7 Li reservoir from which they\nare more susceptible to proton burning. This mechanism suppresses the overall outcome of\nthe A = 7 elements.\nto the generation of extra D. Therefore, one should expect that this mechanism of depleting\n7 Be is tightly constrained by the abundance of D. The temperature evolution of elemental\nabundances in the presence of an extra source of thermal neutrons is illustrated in Fig. 5.\nElevated neutron concentrations can be caused by decaying or annihilating particles that\ncontain a significant number of baryons in the final state. This presence is amplified when\nthe energetic particles lose their energy in collisions with the primordial plasma. Many\ndetails of such processes depend on concrete particle physics realizations: particle masses,\nabundances, lifetimes, branching ratios to nucleons, and so forth all play important roles.\nIn Figure 6 we both emulate the process of energy injection by assuming very rapid thermalization and study the effect of extra neutrons on 7 Li+7 Be and D abundances by varying the\namount of injected neutrons, while assuming different time (or temperature) patterns for\nsuch injections. Specifically, we include cases of decaying particles (with different lifetimes),\nand annihilating WIMPs, with or without possible Sommerfeld or resonant enhancement of\nannihilation [81].

Only a relatively small\nsubset of models, typically those whose decaying particles have lifetimes below 1000 s are\nconsistent with D/H, and provide enough suppression for 7 Li. However, the injection of\nenergetic neutrons, ignored in this treatment is also important because of secondary and\ntertiary reactions induced by the neutrons. These reactions lead to an increase of rare light\nelements such as 6 Li and 9 Be. This method of correcting the lithium problem is subject to\nadditional constraints from 6 Li and 9 Be.\n3.1.2 Production of 6 Li, 9 Be, and 10 B in secondary collisions. As stated in\nthe introduction, the abundances of these elements predicted by SBBN are extremely low.\nThe path to them is heavily hindered as it is guarded by (a) the breaks at A = 5 and 8,\n(b) the low efficiency of the SBBN reaction (17) and (c) the efficient destruction of these\nelements by protons which stops only at T \u223c 10 keV when the destruction rates fall below\nthe Hubble expansion rate. Non-equilibrium BBN provides an important mechanism for\ncircumventing at least some of that suppression through access to endo-thermic reactions\nthat have much higher cross sections [67].\nEnergetic mass three nuclei, 3 He and tritium, produced via electromagnetic or hadronic\n\n\f22\n\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis as a Probe of New Physics\n\n103\n6 Li/H\n\n102\n101\n\u01ebem YX /GeV\n\n1\n10\u22121\n10\u22122\n\n10\u221210\n\n10\u22123\n10\u221211\n\n10\u22124\n\n10\u221212\n\n10\u22125\n\nprim.\nprim.+sec.\n\n10\u22126\n10\u22127\n104\n\n105 106\n\n107\n\n10\u221213\n\n108 109 1010 1011 1012\n\u03c4X /sec\n\nFigure 7: Contour lines of 6 Li/H in the plane of X-lifetime \u03c4X and total injected (electromagnetic) energy per baryon: \u01ebem YX .

The overall efficiency of\nproducing 6 Li from energetic 3 He and tritium reaches its maximum at O(10\u22124 \u221210\u22123 ) below\nT = 10 keV; therefore, even one energetic nucleus of tritium per one million protons can\nhave a very significant impact on 6 Li. This enhancement figure underscores the sensitivity\nof 6 Li to non-thermal BBN and makes it an important probe of energy injection mechanisms\nin the early Universe.\nFigure 7 illustrates the importance of accounting for secondary reactions of the kind (26)\n\n\fBig Bang Nucleosynthesis as a Probe of New Physics\n\n23\n\nwhen tracking the 6 Li output in scenarios with electromagnetic energy release at late times.\nShown are contour lines of constant 6 Li/H for varying lifetime \u03c4X of an decaying species\nX and different total injected (electromagnetic) energy per baryon, \u01ebem YX .

In our\ntreatment of photodissociation processes we primarily follow the approach of Ref. [79].\nThe doubtful observational status of 6 Li and the possibility of its stellar depletion over\nand above the depletion of 7 Li should stimulate studies of 9 Be and boron production via the\nnon-thermal nucleosynthesis. So far, this subject has escaped the attention of the groups\nworking on non-equilibrium BBN. Note that tertiary processes may be responsible for the\nnon-equilibrium 9 Be production. The 6 He and 6 Li nuclei emerging from secondary reactions\n(26) can collide further with particles from the bath,\n6\n\nLi + 4 He \u2192 9 Be + p, Q = \u22122.13MeV\n\n6\n\n4\n\n(27)\n\n9\n\nHe + He \u2192 Be + n, Q = 0.60MeV,\n\nand generate 9 Be from A = 6 nuclei with similar efficiencies to the A = 3 \u2192 A = 6\ntransition. The actual output of 9 Be relative to 6 Li is enhanced beyond a crude estimate\nof O(10\u22124 \u2212 10\u22123 ) if, for example, the energy injection occurs both at very early times and\nabove T = 12 keV, where 6 Li is more rapidly destroyed by proton reactions than 9 Be is.\nGiven the absence of a primordial 9 Be plateau down to the level of 10\u221213 , it is desirable to\ninvestigate the tertiary production mechanisms of beryllium and boron in more detail [82].\n\n3.2\n\nEnergy injection by WIMPs\n\nDecays of heavy relics may represent the simplest possible way to achieve energy injection.\nHowever, without specifying the model and the physical mechanisms that lead to the production of unstable particles and their subsequent decay, one cannot estimate the amount\nor the timing of the energy injection. In contrast, WIMPs represent a somewhat more\nrestricted framework in which the leading mechanisms regulating the WIMP abundance\nat BBN time is their self-annihilation at earlier times. Assuming a weak-scale mass for a\nrelic WIMP as well as a typical range for the annihilation cross section, one can deduce\nits abundance as a function of mass and annihilation rate. The most restrictive framework\nis that of stable neutral WIMPs that form the dominant component of cold dark matter.\nAlthough most of the WIMPs annihilate when the temperature drops below the WIMP\nmass, a residual annihilation persists even at BBN times [83]. The question of WIMP\nannihilation at early times, during BBN, is important in view of the attempts to detect\nsignatures of WIMP annihilation in our own Galaxy. Indeed, a broad similarity among\nWIMP velocities inside the Galaxy and during BBN tells us that the kinematics of WIMP\ncollisions must be very similar.\n\n\f24\n\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis as a Probe of New Physics\n\nThe most straightforward case to consider is a single species of WIMP dark matter X\nwith annihilation rate (\u03c3v)0 \u2243 3 \u00d7 10\u221226 cm3 s\u22121 averaged over the thermal bath at the\nfreeze-out. Such an annihilation rate yields a total energy density of WIMPs that is close\nto what is required for cold dark matter by observations. This result provides us with a\nconvenient normalization point for the annihilation rate at arbitrary WIMP velocities in\nthe center-of-mass frame:\n\u03c3(v)v = S(v)(\u03c3v)0 .\n(28)\nIn the simplest case, in which the annihilation is mediated by short-distance forces and\nproceeds in the s-wave, the velocity dependence is trivial: S(v) = 1. The fraction of\nWIMPs that is still annihilating at the time of BBN during one Hubble time H \u22121 is given\nby\nh\u03c3(v)vinX\n(29)\nfX (tBBN ) \u2243\nH\nt=tBBN\nwhere h...i denotes a thermal average that can be calculated once the velocity dependence\nof S(v) and the thermal distribution of WIMPs are specified.\nWe are interested in finding the fraction of annihilating WIMP particles within a Hubble\ntime at T < 10 keV, specifically, at a temperature scale below which 6 Li is no longer\nsusceptible to nuclear burning in the 6 Li(p, \u03b1)3 He reaction. In general, this fraction can be\nexpressed via the freeze-out temperature Tf \u223c 0.05mX and the number of effective degrees\nof freedom at an arbitrary temperature T < Tf [10]:\n\u0015\n\u0014\ng(T ) 1/2 T\nhS(v)iT .\n(30)\nfX (T ) \u2243\ng(Tf )\nTf\nThere are several generic options for the temperature scaling of the S-factor in (30). In\nthe simplest case of S(v) = 1, one can use Eq. (30) to deduce that for a WIMP of mass\nMX = 100 GeV (TF \u223c 5 GeV) only a small fraction, fX \u2248 6 \u00d7 10\u22127 , of the X-particles\nhas the chance to annihilate at T \u2243 10 keV and below. This corresponds to an injection of\napproximately 10\u221215 GeV per photon. Nevertheless, even this tiny fraction may be sufficient\nto produce a 6 Li abundance up to the 10\u221212 -level, provided that hadronic annihilation\nchannels dominate. Lighter WIMPs may have a more pronounced effect on BBN [73].\nShort-range mediated annihilation in the p-wave gives S(v) \u223c v 2 and negligible energy\nrelease at BBN.\nMuch enhanced annihilation rates occur in models where interactions are mediated by\nan attractive Coulomb-like force and/or have near-threshold resonances. Both mechanisms of enhancing the galactic annihilation have been widely discussed (see e.g. [81])\nin an attempt to link some cosmic-ray anomalies-such as an elevated positron fraction\ne+ /(e\u2212 + e+ ) observed by the PAMELA satellite experiment [84]-to dark matter annihilation. For example, an attractive \u2212\u03b1\u2032 /r potential in the WIMP sector leads to a\nsignificant enhancement of annihilation at low velocities via a well-known Sommerfeld fac\u2032\n\u2032\ntor \u03c3v \u223c (\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 /v)[1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 /v)]\u22121 ; when v <\n\u223c \u03c0\u03b1 , S(v) \u2243 \u03c0\u03b1 /v. This enhancement,\nin turn, generates a \u223c T \u22121/2 scaling of hS(v)iT in (30) when WIMPs are still in kinetic\n\n\fBig Bang Nucleosynthesis as a Probe of New Physics\n\n25\n\nequilibrium with the plasma. Once the WIMPs' interactions with the thermalized plasma\nspecies have ceased, hS(v)iT falls even more rapidly as \u223c T \u22121 . Therefore, the fraction of\nWIMPs annihilated in a Hubble time scales with photon temperature as follows:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2fX (T ) \u223c T 1/2\nkinetic equilibrium\nSommerfeld\n\uf8f3f (T ) \u223c const\nenhancement:\nkinetically decoupled\nX\n\nSimilarly, the presence of narrow resonances just above the XX annihilation threshold may\ndrastically boost the annihilation at low energies. For a narrow resonance at some energy\nER above the di-WIMP threshold the pattern of energy injection has a sharp cutoff:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2f (T ) \u223c exp(\u2212E /T )\nkinetic equilibrium\nX\nR\nResonant\n\uf8f3f (T ) \u223c exp(\u2212E T /T 2 )\nenhancement:\nkinetically decoupled\nX\n\nR kd\n\nwhere Tkd is the temperature of WIMP kinetic decoupling. Notably, the last pattern\n(resonant annihilation, kinetically decoupled WIMPs) has the same time dependence as the\nenergy injection as particle decays, exp(\u2212t/\u03c4X ), on account of the t \u223c 1/T 2 relation. If the\nannihilation cross sections h\u03c3vi(tBBN ) are enhanced by some large factor, \u223c O(103 ), relative\nto the fiducial WIMP rate (\u03c3v)0 , then WIMP physics can have a significant impact on the\nprimordial abundance of 6 Li. However, a large class of models that predict the WIMPenhancement of the PAMELA positron signal produce light particles (photons, electrons,\nlight mesons) via annihilation, which has a much weaker effect on 6 Li.\nA case of independent interest is the decay of a WIMP-like state with a stable non-SM\nparticle in the final state. The initial abundance of so-called \"parent\" WIMPs is given by\nits annihilation at the freeze-out, whereas their decays may source the dark matter energy\ndensity. If the amount of energy released in such decays is on the order of the parent WIMP\nmass, then in such a scenario an amount of energy comparable to the dark matter energy\ndensity could be released into the primordial plasma. If so, BBN with energy injection sets\na rather strict constraint: The lifetime of the parent particle must be less than \u223c 107 s if\nthe decays are fully electromagnetic and shorter than 104 s if there is a significant hadronic\ncomponent among the decays products. In the next section we explain that the sensitivity\nto the lifetime of such parent WIMP particles can be even stronger if they carry negative\nelectric charge.\n\n4\n\nCATALYZED BBN\n\nIn this section we discuss changes to BBN in a scenario where particles from a new physics\nsector participate in thermal nuclear reactions before decaying. Such an unusual situation\nmay arise if the particles are charged under the electromagnetic or strong group of the\nSM [85]. The idea of particle physics catalysis of nuclear reactions dates from the 1950s,\nwhen muon-catalyzed fusion became a subject of active theoretical and experimental research in nuclear physics. More recently, interest in the possibility of nuclear catalysis by\n\n\f26\n\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis as a Probe of New Physics\n\nhypothetical negatively charged particles that live long enough to participate in nuclear\nreactions at the time of BBN has intensified [85,86,87,76,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,53,95] (see\nalso Ref. [96,97,98] for earlier work on the subject). The essence of the idea is very simple:\nA negatively charged massive particle, which we term X \u2212 , gets into a bound state with the\nnucleus of mass mN and charge Z, forming a large compound nucleus with charge Z \u2212 1,\nmass MX + mN , and binding energy in the O(0.1 \u2212 1) MeV range. Once the bound state\nis formed, the Coulomb barrier is reduced, signaling higher \"reactivity\" between the compound nucleus and other nuclei. Even more importantly, new reaction channels may open\nup and avoid SBBN-suppressed production mechanisms [85], e.g. Eq. (17), thus clearing\nthe path to the synthesis of very rare isotopes such as 6 Li and 9 Be.\nInterest in catalyzed BBN (CBBN) is partly motivated by a possible connection to dark\nmatter. Even though dark matter should not be charged, it is possible that it comes with\na relatively long-lived charged counterpart. An example of this kind is weak-scale supersymmetry (SUSY), where the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) being the gravitino\nand the next-to-LSP (NLSP) a charged slepton. In that case the decay of the NLSP is\n\u22121\ngreatly delayed by the smallness of the gravitino-lepton-slepton coupling \u223c MPl\n. Another\nexample in the same vein is a nearly degenerate stau-neutralino system, in which case the\nlongevity of the charged stau against the decay to the dark matter neutralino is ensured as\nlong as the mass splitting of the stau-neutralino system is below 100 MeV [99]. In these\ntwo examples, both, the gravitino and neutralino represent viable dark matter candidates.\nA very important aspect of CBBN is that the abundance of charged particles before they\nbegin to decay is given by their annihilation rate at freeze-out. In most models these particles' abundance is easy to calculate. If no special mechanisms are introduced to boost the\nannihilation rate, then the abundance of charged particles per nucleon is not small [ typical\nrange of YX = nX /nb \u223c (0.001\u22120.1)mX /TeV]. Moreover, the charged states accompanying\ndark matter are often required in order to facilitate the WIMP annihilation process which\nresults in a cosmologically acceptable dark matter abundance-a phenomenon known as\nco-annihilation.\n\n4.1\n\nCatalysis by stable charged particles.\n\nIn this section we describe BBN catalysis by use of negatively charged heavy relics X \u2212 ; we\ndo not attempt to place this phenomenon in a specific particle physics model framework, and\nwe ignore the effects of energy injection due to the X \u2212 decay. We describe an elementary\nparticle, so typical collider bounds would require mX \u2212 >\n\u223c 100 GeV.\n4.1.1 Properties of the bound states. For light nuclei that participate in BBN,\nwe can assume that the reduced mass of the nucleus-X \u2212 system is well approximated by the\nnuclear mass, so that the binding energy is given by Z 2 \u03b12 mA /2 when the Bohr orbit is larger\nthan the nuclear radius. However, this is a poor approximation for all nuclei heavier than\nA = 4, and the effect of the finite nuclear charge radius must be taken into account. In Table\n1 we give the binding energies and the recombination temperature for each bound state.

Below these temperatures, bound\nstates are practically stable. The most important benchmark temperatures for CBBN are\nT \u223c 30, 8, and 0.5 keV for the respective bound states (7 BeX \u2212 ), (4 HeX \u2212 ), and (pX \u2212 )\nwhen they can be formed without efficient suppression by the photodissociation processes.\nImportantly, these properties of the bound states are generic to any CBBN realization\nwhen X \u2212 does not participate in strong interactions; in other words, they are determined\nentirely by the charge of X \u2212 and electromagnetic properties of the nuclei and therefore are\napplicable to SUSY and non-SUSY models alike. Also, the (8 BeX \u2212 ) compound nucleus is\nstable, which may open the path to synthesis of A > 8 elements in CBBN.\n4.1.2\nCatalysis at 30 keV: suppression of 7 Be.\nWhile the Universe cools to\n3\n4\n7\ntemperatures of 30 keV, the abundances of D, He, He, Be and 7 Li are already close to\ntheir freeze-out values, although several nuclear processes remain faster than the Hubble\nrate. At such temperatures, a negatively charged relic can get into bound states with 7 Be\nand form a (7 BeX \u2212 ) composite object through the photo-recombination process. Once a\ncomposite object is formed, new destruction mechanisms for 7 Be appear. For models with\nweak currents connecting nearly mass-degenerate X \u2212 and X 0 states, a very fast internal\nconversion followed by the p-destruction of 7 Li becomes possible:\n(7 BeX \u2212 ) \u2192 7 Li + X 0 ; 7 Li + p \u2192 2\u03b1.\n\n(31)\n\nAlternatively, 7 Li can be destroyed via recombination with X \u2212 and subsequent conversion\nto unstable 7 He [90]. When a X \u2212 \u2192X 0 weak transition is not allowed, the destruction of\n7 Be can be achieved via the following chain:\n(7 BeX \u2212 ) + p \u2192 (8 BX \u2212 ) + \u03b3 : (8 BX \u2212 ) \u2192 (8 BeX \u2212 ) + e+ \u03bd,\n\n(32)\n\nwhich is greatly enhanced by atomic resonances in the (7 BeX \u2212 ) system [89].\nThe rates for both mechanisms may be faster than the Hubble rate and may therefore\nleading to a sizable suppression of 7 Be abundance if (7 BeX \u2212 ) bound states are forming\nefficiently. In other words, (7 BeX \u2212 ) serves as a bottleneck for the CBBN depletion of 7 Be.\nThe recombination rate per 7 Be nucleus leading to (7 BeX \u2212 ) is given by the product of\n\n\f28\n\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis as a Probe of New Physics\n\nthe recombination cross section and the concentration of X \u2212 particles. It is easy to show\nthat for YX <\n\u223c 0.01 the recombination rate is too slow to lead to a significant depletion of\n7 Be. Detailed calculations of the recombination rate and numerical analyses of CBBN at\n30 keV [89,94] find that a suppression of 7 Be by a factor of two is possible for (a) YX \u2265 0.1\nif the mechanism in Eq. (32) alone is operative, and (b) for YX \u2265 0.02, if the internal\nconversion of Eq. (31) is allowed. Even if YX \u223c O(0.1 \u2212 1), X 0 could still be compatible\nwith dark matter as long as mX 0 is suppressed relative to mX \u2212 .\n4.1.3 Catalysis at 8 keV: enhancement of 6 Li and 9 Be. As the Universe continues to cool below 10 keV, the efficient formation of (4 HeX \u2212 ) bound states becomes possible.\nIf we make the reasonable assumption that YX <\n\u223c Y4 He then the rate of formation of bound\n\u2212\nstates per X particle is given by the recombination cross section and the concentration\nof the helium nuclei. A numerical analysis of recombination reveals that at T \u2243 5 keV\napproximately 50% of the available X \u2212 particles are in bound states with 4 He [85].\nAs soon as (4 HeX \u2212 ) is formed, new reaction channels open up. In particular, a photonless\nthermal production of 6 Li becomes possible\n(4 HeX \u2212 ) + D \u2192 6 Li + X \u2212 ; Q \u2243 1.13MeV.\n\n(33)\n\nThis rate exceeds the SBBN production rate by approximately six orders of magnitude. The\nproduction of 9 Be may also be catalyzed, possibly by many orders of magnitude relative to\nthe SBBN values, with the following thermal nuclear chain [93]:\n(4 HeX \u2212 ) + 4 He \u2192 (8 BeX \u2212 ) + \u03b3; (8 BeX \u2212 ) + n \u2192 9 Be + X \u2212 .\n\n(34)\n\nBoth reactions at these energies are dominated by resonant contributions, although the\nefficiency of the second process in (34) is not fully understood. (A recent calculation [95]\nplaces the resonance found in the (9 BeX \u2212 ) system [93] below the threshold. However,\nbecause this is a reaction with a neutral particle, even the sub-threshold resonance may\ngive a strong enhancement of the neutron capture.)\nCurrent estimates and calculations of the CBBN rates are used to determine the generic\nconstraints on the lifetimes and abundances of charged particles. The essence of these limits\nis depicted in Figures 8 and 9, which shows that for typical X \u2212 abundances the lifetime\nof the charged particles would have to be limited by a few thousand seconds (unless a\nspecial mechanism for suppressing YX is found, as in e.g. [100, 101]). This is the most\nimportant fact to be learned from the catalysis of BBN by charged particles. Although\nto lowest order non-thermal BBN is sensitive to the energy density of decaying particles,\nthe CBBN processes are controlled by the number density of X \u2212 , which underscores the\ncomplementary character of these constraints. In some models, in which both catalysis and\nnon-equilibrium nucleosynthesis occur, catalysis dominates the non-thermal production of\n6 Li for all particles with hadronic branching ratio B < 10\u22122 [92], whereas 7 Li destruction\nh\u223c\n\u22124\nis usually dominated by neutron injection effects unless Bh <\n\u223c 10 .\n4.1.4\nCatalysis below 1 keV? Finally we comment on the possibility of (pX \u2212 )\ncatalysis of nuclear reactions, discussed in Refs. [97,91].

The red cross corresponds to a point in the parameter space; the temporal development of 6 Li and 9 Be for\nthis point is shown in Figure 9 [53].\nabsence of the Coulomb barrier for this compound nucleus may lead to significant changes\nof SBBN/CBBN predictions, in practice (pX \u2212 )-related mechanisms are of only secondary\nimportance in most cases. The large radius and shallow binding of this system leads to a fast\ncharge-exchange reaction on helium: (pX \u2212 ) + 4 He\u2192 (4 HeX \u2212 ) + p. This reaction reduces\nthe abundance of (pX \u2212 ) below 10\u22126 relative to hydrogen, as long as YX \u2212 <\n\u223c Y4 He , making\nfurther reactions inconsequential for any observable element [53]. In the less likely case\n\u2212\nin which YX \u2212 >\n\u223c Y4 He , significant late-time processing due to (pX ) bound states may still\noccur. Nevertheless, such late-time BBN typically leads to observationally unacceptable\nfinal BBN yields.\nUnlike in the SBBN case and even in non-equilibrium nucleosynthesis that utilizes mostly\nmeasured nuclear reaction rates, CBBN rates cannot be measured in the laboratory; significant nuclear theory input for the calculation of the reaction rates is required. However,\nbecause the X \u2212 participates only in electromagnetic interactions, such calculations are feasible, and dedicated nuclear theory studies [88, 95] for certain important CBBN processes\n[such as those of Eqs. (32) and (33)] have already been performed.\n\n\f30\n\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis as a Probe of New Physics\n\n1\n\nYp\n\nYX \u2212 = 5 \u00d7 10\u22124\n\u03c4X \u2212 = 5 \u00d7 103 sec\n\n10\u22122\n10\u22124\n\nX\u2212\nD/H\n\n10\u22126\n\n(4 HeX \u2212 )\nN\n\n10\u22128\n(8 BeX \u2212 )\n\n10\u221210\n\n6\n\n10\u221212\n\n9\n\nLi/H|CBBN\n\nBe/H|CBBN\n\n6\n\n10\u221214\n10\u221216\n100\n\n10\nT /keV\n\nLi/H|SBBN\n\n1\n\nFigure 9: The temperature evolution of the bound state abundances (4 HeX \u2212 ) and (8 BeX \u2212 ),\nas well as the synthesis of 6 Li and 9 Be at T \u223c8 keV.

The main difficulty of this scenario lies in determining the properties of the composite nuclei that contain Xs . For some types of Xs , some progress can\nbe made. Specifically, if Xs represents an isospin doublet similar to (n, p), one could draw\nsome conclusions about the binding energies with nucleons by utilizing our extensive theoretical knowledge of two-nucleon systems. For example, a heavy scalar quark (or squark),\nwould attract one light quark and become a spin-1/2 \"mesino\" with similar interaction\nproperties as normal nucleons. In other examples involving a particle in the adjoint representation, such as a gluino, it is almost impossible at this point to determine whether\nit would bind to a single nucleon and, if so, with what energy. Regardless of the type of\nstrongly interacting relic, the relic's abundance is expected to be suppressed by more than\nfive orders of magnitude compared with X \u2212 due to a very efficient annihilation channel\nfollowing hadronization [104].\nDetailed investigations of mesino-nucleon bound systems [103] offer insight into Xs catalyzed BBN. By making fairly generous assumptions about the uncertainties in the\n\n\fBig Bang Nucleosynthesis as a Probe of New Physics\n\n31\n\ninteraction strength, the binding energy of the mesino-nucleon system would typically\nbe between 5 and 40 MeV, which is much larger than the deuteron binding energy Ed .\nA tighter bound nucleon-mesino system is expected, because the shallow binding of the\ndeuteron is to some extent \"accidental\", and because going from a nucleon-nucleon system\nto a nucleon-mesino decreases the kinetic energy and results in a stronger binding. The\nmain cosmological consequence of a tightly-bound mesino-nucleon system is the formation\nof such bound states long before the end of the SBBN deuterium bottleneck, and, hence, at\ntimes when neutrons are abundant. For example, a \u223c 20 MeV binding would correspond\nto a new bottleneck at T \u223c 1 MeV, thereby opening up an interesting new possibility for\nnucleosynthesis in the neutron-rich environment around each Xs particle. Unfortunately, a\ndetailed study of such a nucleosynthetic path is currently beyond theoretical capabilities,\nmostly due to the rather uncertain spectrum of light mesino-containing nuclei. While certain claims were made that nucleosynthesis proceeds to form the A \u2265 6 elements [102], it\nappears equally plausible that nucleosynthesis around strongly interacting particles stops\nat a \"compound helium\"-a bound state consisting of a mesino particle and three nucleons.\nNucleosynthesis of heavier elements around a mesino may be inhibited by (p, \u03b1) reactions,\nas well as by an expected weak binding in a system containing five particles (one mesino\nand four nucleons) [103]. It is fair to say that much more theoretical work will be required\nbefore we fully understand the primordial catalysis caused by strongly-interacting particles.\n\n5\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis, a very short period in the history of the Universe, is an important\nreference point going back to cosmological times of a few seconds. In this review we have\nshown how new physics can modify the synthesis of light elements and therefore be probed\nby contrasting the observations of helium and deuterium (as well as lithium, beryllium, and\nboron) with the BBN predictions. All three generic methods-modifications to the timing of\nmain BBN events via extra degrees of freedom or space-time dependent couplings and mass\nscales, non-equilibrium nucleosynthesis triggered by energy injection via the annihilation\nor decay of heavy particles, and particle catalysis of BBN reactions-are very important\nto many extensions of the Standard Model. In some models, the sensitivity of BBN to\nnew physics is exceptional and indeed exceeds all other direct and indirect probes. A\nrepresentative example is the non-trivial limit on the lifetime of a metastable charged\nparticle (e.g. a stau decaying to a gravitino) that follows from the considerations of the 6 Li\nabundance, a limit that currently cannot be constrained other than in BBN.\nThe amount of lithium predicted by SBBN is of the same order of magnitude as the\nvalue indicated by the Spite plateau. However, a detailed comparison with the standard\ncosmology and particle physics input shows that SBBN over-predicts the abundance of\n7 Li by a factor of three to five. This discrepancy has become more concrete, given that\nthe baryon-to-photon ratio and the main SBBN reactions determining 7 Li abundance are\nknown to an accuracy of better than 10%. We have suggested possible solutions to the\n\n\f32\n\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis as a Probe of New Physics\n\nproblem that may reside in subtle astrophysical effects, or in new cosmological and/or\nparticle physics ingredients. Here we summarize these (and some additional) options\n\u2022 The most economical solution to the lithium discrepancy would be an astrophysical\nmechanism that depletes lithium from the photic zone in the atmospheres of population II stars. Several ideas as to the nature of this mechanism is have been proposed\nin the literature, and hints at traces of such depletion in the scatter of points along the\nSpite plateau have been found [44]. Although some amount of depletion is certainly\npossible, it is premature to concede that it can account for the discrepancy of a factor\nof approximately three. Clearly that this issue remains one of the most important\nastrophysical issues in the cosmology of the early Universe.\n\u2022 Nuclear physics is unlikely to be responsible for the solution to the lithium problem,\nas all main reactions participating in creation and destruction of lithium are well\nknown. Perhaps the last subject worth of detailed investigation is a possible resonant\nenhancement of the 7 Be+D reaction [46], which could contribute to the depletion of\n7 Be, albeit at the very end of the most optimistic range for the parameters of such a\nresonance. This issue can be directly clarified through experiments.\n\u2022 Given that lithium is observed in the Milky Way, whereas the measurements of deuterium and especially \u03b7b are global, one may speculate that baryons and possibly dark\nmatter are distributed non-uniformly and that the 30-50% downward fluctuation of \u03b7b\nat the local patch of the Universe leads to a local value of lithium that is close to the\nSpite plateau value (see e.g. [105] for a recent discussion). Of course, the variations\nin baryon number by a factor of a few, if persistent at all scales, would create very\nstrong isocurvature-type features in the CMB polarization maps. However, it is also\npossible that models with anticorrelated baryon-dark matter fluctuations with a very\nblue perturbation spectrum may survive all observational constraints.\n\u2022 Particle physics models with unstable or annihilating particles may have an important effect on the lithium abundance. Although the photo-disintegration of lithium\nby a factor of three is difficult to reconcile with the deuterium abundance and/or the\n3 He/D ratio (unless the mass of a decaying particle is carefully chosen), the energy\ninjection with some yield of nucleons in the final state may fare much better. Indeed,\nthe injection of neutrons (regardless of the details of the particle physics mechanism) before the freeze-out of 7 Li(p, \u03b1)\u03b1 reaction can reduce the 7 Be and therefore\n7 Li abundance. A necessary consequence of this scenario is a somewhat elevated D/H\nabundance, and probably elevated concentrations of other rare isotope of lithium (and\npossibly beryllium and boron).\n\u2022 The catalytic suppression of 7 Li by negatively charged particles relies on the fact that\n(7 BeX \u2212 ) is the deepest bound state among all X \u2212 -bound nuclei which can form at\ntemperatures of approximately 30 keV. The most efficient suppression of 7 Be happens\nin models allowing for weak transitions to 7 Li at these temperatures. The need for a\n\n\fBig Bang Nucleosynthesis as a Probe of New Physics\n\n33\n\nlarge number of X \u2212 at 30 keV also implies the presence of X \u2212 at T \u223c 10 keV, which\nwould lead to the catalyzed synthesis of 6 Li and 9 Be.\n\u2022 The last and perhaps most exotic option is the possibility of coupling constants and\nmass scales changing over time. Indeed, a \u223c 5% change in the deuterium binding\nenergy can create a very strong downward shift of the 7 Li abundance, while remaining\nconsistent with helium and deuterium abundances.\nWe do not yet know how to resolve the lithium problem; only continuing progress in\nparticle physics, cosmology, and astrophysics will help to clarify this intriguing discrepancy.\nFinally, we discuss some anticipated future developments that are not necessarily directly\nrelated to BBN but rather are related to questions discussed in our review.\n\u2022 CMB physics will continue to deliver very important results. Of particular interest\nto this review is the increased sensitivity on small angular scales (high-l multipoles)\nwhere the effects of extra \"dark radiation\" states or certain types of isocurvature\nfluctuations are the most pronounced. Future data from the Planck satellite experiment will allow us to probe the dark radiation energy density with an accuracy of\n\u2206N\u03bd,eff \u223c 0.5 or better; results thus obtained will thereby provide an independent\ncheck of the constraints resulting from 4 He abundances.\n\u2022 The Large Hadron Collider is expected to deliver its first physics results in the near\nfuture. The TeV energy frontier will be effectively probed, which may lead to the\ndiscovery of stable or massive metastable particles. If such particles were neutral,\ntheir signature would constitute \"missing energy\", which is difficult but not impossible\nto disentangle from SM processes. However, if a metastable particle were charged a\nunder strong or electromagnetic gauge group, the signatures would be much more\nspectacular, with long charged tracks that would allow us to identify the mass of\nsuch objects. If charged metastable states are discovered at the LHC, the theories of\nnon-equilibrium and catalyzed nucleosynthesis would be further reinforced.\n\u2022 A massive expansion of the dark matter search program, both in space and in underground laboratories, may point to the existence of WIMPs in the near future. If\nWIMPs turn out to be relatively light (in the 10-50 GeV window), then the energy\ninjection in the early universe could lead to altered 7 Li and 6 Li abundances. Heavier WIMPs with enhanced annihilation cross sections devised to fit the PAMELA\npositron anomaly [84] may also lead to changes in lithium abundances, and therefore\nany future development that supports or disfavors the WIMP interpretation of the\nPAMELA anomaly is of interest for the BBN predictions.\n\u2022 Finally, further theoretical progress in non-SBBN scenarios is expected. Given the\ndoubtful status of 6 Li observations and its extreme fragility, it is highly desirable\nto perform calculations of beryllium and boron abundances generated in BBN scenarios with energy injection. Doing so may place further constraints on annihilating/decaying WIMP scenarios.
