Ramana\n\narXiv:0705.1739v1 [math.NT] 11 May 2007\n\n1. I NTRODUCTION\n\nAn important requirement in the context of inequalities of the large sieve type is to obtain\nP\nP\nestimates for the sum x\u2208X | i\u2208I ai e(xyi ))|2 , where X is a well-spaced set of real numbers, I\n\nis a finite set, {ai }i\u2208I are complex numbers and {yi }i\u2208I is a sparse subsequence of the integers.\n\nBasic examples of sparse sequences of integers are provided by the sequence of values of polynomials of degree \u2265 2 with integer coefficients. The present article is concerned with the case\nwhen polynomial is of degree 2. Indeed, in a recent note, Liangyi Zhao [4], showed, by an\nelegant application of the double large sieve inequality of Bombieri and Iwaniec, that one has\nthe estimate given below, which we state with the aid of the following notation.\nWhen Q is a real number \u2265 1, the Farey series of order Q is the sequence of rational numbers in (0, 1) whose denominators, when expressed lowest form, do not exceed Q. Given a\nfinite sequence of complex numbers {ai }i\u2208I , indexed by a finite set I, we write kak2 to denote\nP\n2\ni\u2208I |ai | .\nT HEOREM (L. Z HAO ).- Let Q be a real number \u2265 1 and suppose that F(Q) is the Farey sequence of\n\norder Q and that P (T ) = c0 T 2 + c1 T + c2 is a polynomial in R[T ] with c0 6= 0, c1 /c0 = p/q \u2208 Q,\nc1 > 0 and (p, q) = 1. When {ai }M <i\u2264M +N is a sequence of complex numbers indexed by the integers\nin the interval (M, M + N ], where M and N are integers with N \u2265 1, we have\n\n(1)\n\nX\n\nX\n\n2\n\nai e(xP (i))\n\n\u226a (Q2 + Q\n\nx\u2208F (Q) M <i\u2264M +N\n\np\n\nc0 N (|M | + 2N + p/q + 1)\u03a0kak2 ,\n\nwhere the implied constant depends on \u01eb alone and\n\u03a0=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013 1 +\u01eb\n2\nq\n[N q(|M | + N ) + |p| + q/c0 ]\u01eb .\n+1\nc0\n\nZhao has shown in [4], Section 3, page 4 that one may device examples of P (T ) and the sequence {ai } for which the left hand side of (1) is \u226b (N Q + Q2 )kak2 , thereby showing that (1) is\nessentially the best possible.\nThere, however, remains the question of determining the extent to which the dependence of\nthe right hand side of (1) on M and the coefficients of P (T ) may be reduced, given that the\ntrivial estimate for the left hand side of (1) is independent of these parameters. In the present\n1\n\n\farticle we combine Zhao's method with an interpolation argument due to Heath-Brown [3] to\nshow that atleast a modest improvement upon the above theorem along these lines is certainly\npossible. More precisely, the corollary to Theorem 1 of Section 3 below shows that , under the\nsame hypotheses as in the above theorem, (1) holds with the factor \u03a0 replaced with\n\u2032\n\n\u03a0 =\u03c0\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00131\n2\n2q\n+1\nc0\n\nsup\n\nr(n) ,\n\n1\u2264n\u2264144N 4\n\nand the \u226a in (1) replaced by \u2264. Here r(n) , for an integer n, is the number of integer points on\n(x, y) satisfying x2 + y 2 = n.\nThe reader will note with interest that S. Baier has already shown in [1] that an analog of our\nconclusion recorded in the corollary to Theorem 1 of Section 3 holds for all quadratic polynomials with real coefficients when one replaces kak2 with Card(I) supi\u2208I |ai |2 . Moerover, this work\nof Baier also investigates what might be expected to hold for higher degree polynomials in this\ncontext.\n2. P RELIMINARIES\n\n2.1. \u03b4-Spaced Sets. - Let \u03b4 > 0. A \u03b4-spaced set of real numbers is a finite set X of distinct\nreal numbers containing atleast two elements and such that |x \u2212 x\u2032 | \u2265 \u03b4, whenever x and\nx\u2032 are distinct elements of X . Let X be a \u03b4- spaced set and \u01eb > 0. We then set S(\u01eb, x) =\nCard (x\u2032 \u2208 X | |x \u2212 x\u2032 | \u2264 \u01eb). We have\n(1)\n\nS(\u01eb, x) \u2264 1 +\n\n2\u01eb\nfor all x in X .\n\u03b4\n\n2.2. The function \u03c6. - Let \u03c6(t) denote the characteristic function of the interval [\u22121/2, 1/2] and\nfor each \u01eb > 0, set \u03c6\u01eb (t) = \u03c6(t/2\u01eb). Thus \u03c6\u01eb (t) is the characteristic function of the interval [\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb].\nOn setting sin t/t to 1 when t = 0 we have\n(2)\n\nb\n\u03c6b\u01eb (t) = 2\u01eb\u03c6(2\u01ebt)\n= 2\u01eb\n\n\u0012\n\nsin 2\u03c0\u01ebt\n2\u03c0\u01ebt\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\nThe classical inequality 2/\u03c0 \u2264 sin t/t \u2264 1 for t in [0, \u03c0/2] then implies the inequality\n(3)\nfor all t with \u01ebt in [\u22121/4, 1/4].\n\n1\n1\n\u03c0\n\u2264\n,\n\u2264\n2\u01eb\n4\u01eb\n\u03c6b\u01eb (t)\n\n2.3. A Simple Majorisation Principle. - Let I be a finite set, {yi }i\u2208I be a sequence of integers,\n{ai }i\u2208I a sequence of complex numbers and {bi }i\u2208I a sequence of positive real numbers.

C OUNTING I NTEGER P OINTS\n\nON\n\nC IRCLES\n\nWhen a and b are integers we write (a, b) = 1 to mean that either one of a,b is 1 and the other 0\nor that a and b are both distinct from 0 and are coprime.\nP ROPOSITION 1. - Let H be a real number \u2265 1, m be a rational number and let ci , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 3, be\nintegers with c1 6= 0, c3 \u2265 0, (c1 , c2 ) = 1. Suppose that there are atleast three integer points (x, y)\nsatisfying |x|, |y| \u2264 H and lying on the circle\n(c1 X \u2212 c2 )2 + (c1 Y \u2212 mc2 )2 = c3 .\n\n(1)\nIf m =\n(2)\n\np\nq\n\nwith q > 0 we then have\n|c1 | \u2264 4q(1 + |m|)H, |c2 | \u2264 2qH 2 and c3 \u2264 36q 2 (1 + |m|)2 H 4 .\n\nP ROOF. - We follow the method of proof of Theorem 4, page 564 in [3]. Suppose that pi =\n(xi , yi ), 1 \u2264 i \u2264 3, are three integer points on (1). Since the relation (1) is the same as\n(3)\n\nc1 2 (X 2 + Y 2 ) \u2212 2c1 c2 (X + mY ) + (1 + m2 )c2 2 \u2212 c3 = 0 ,\n\nwe obtain the following relation of matrices on setting (X, Y ) = (xi , yi ) in (3) for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 3.\n\n(4)\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nx1 2 + y1 2 x1 + my1 1\nc1 2\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ecx2 2 + y2 2 x2 + my2 1\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7 = 0.\n\u22122c\nc\n1\n2\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\nx3 2 + y3 2 x3 + my3 1\n(1 + m2 )c2 2 \u2212 c3\n\nLet M denote the 3 \u00d7 3 matrix and c the vector (c21 , \u22122c1 c2 , (1 + m2 )c22 \u2212 c3 ) in Q3 on the left\nhand side of (4). Since c1 6= 0, we have c 6= 0 and hence det(M ) = 0. Let a = (a1 , a2 , a3 ) be a\nsolution distinct from 0 to M a = 0. Then the points pi lie on the conic\n(5)\n\na1 (X 2 + Y 2 ) + a2 (X + mY ) + a3 = 0 .\n\nSince the points pi do not all lie on a line we must have a1 6= 0. Then (5) is an affine circle which\nintersects the affine circle (1) at the three points pi . Since distinct affine circles intersect at no\nmore than 2 points, we have a = \u03b1c, for some complex number \u03b1 which must necessarily be an\nelement of Q. Thus the rank of the matrix M over Q is 2.\n3\n\n\fSuppose now that the rows i and j of M , with i > j, are linearly independent over Q. Then\na = (a1 , a2 , a3 ), where the ai are given by the relations\n\n(6) a1 = q det\n\nxi + myi\n\n1\n\nxj + myj 1\n\n!\n\n, a2 = \u2212q det\n\n!\nxi 2 + yi2 1\nx2j + yj2\n\n1\n\n, a3 = q det\n\nx2i + yi2\n\nxi + myi\n\nx2j + yj2 xj + myj\n\n!\n\n,\n\nsatisfies M a = 0. Since a 6= 0 and there is an \u03b1 in Q such that \u03b1c = a, we have\na2\n\u22122c2\n=\n,\na1\nc1\n\n(7)\n\na3\n(1 + m2 )c22 \u2212 c3\n,\n=\na1\nc21\n\nfrom which we deduce the following relations on setting k = \u22122a1 /c1 6= 0.\n(8)\n\nkc1 = \u22122a1 , kc2 = a2 , and k2 c3 = (1 + m2 )a22 \u2212 4a1 a3 .\n\nSince the ai are integers and (c1 , c2 ) = 1, the relation kc2 = a2 shows that c1 divides \u22122a1 or\nthat k is an integer. Moreover, the triangle inequality applied to the relations in (6) gives\n(9)\n\n|a1 | \u2264 2q(1 + |m|)H, |a2 | \u2264 2qH 2 , and |a3 | \u2264 4q(1 + |m|)H 3 .\n\nWe now obtain (2) on combining (8) with (9) using the triangle inequality and |k| \u2265 1.\nWhen n is an integer \u2265 0, r(n) denotes the number of integer points (x, y) satisfying x2 +y 2 = n.\nC OROLLARY 1. - Let H be a real number \u2265 1 and let ci , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 3, be integers with c1 6= 0.

Then d2\ndivides c3 . Let c1 /d = c\u22171 , c2 /d = c\u22172 and c3 /d2 = c\u22173 . Then N (H) is the same as the number of\ninteger points (x, y) satisfisying |x| \u2264 H, |y| \u2264 H and lying on (c\u22171 X \u2212 c\u22172 )2 + (c\u22171 Y \u2212 c\u22172 )2 = c\u22173 .\nPlainly, N (H) \u2264 r(c\u22173 ). Since c\u22171 6= 0, c\u22173 \u2265 0 and (c\u22171 , c\u22172 ) = 1, Proposition 1 applied with m = 1,\nq = 1 implies that either N (H) \u2264 2 or c\u22173 \u2264 144H 4 so that N (H) \u2264 sup(2, sup1\u2264n\u2264144H 4 r(n)),\nfrom which the corollary follows on noting that sup1\u2264n\u2264144H 4 r(n) \u2265 2 when H \u2265 1.\nC OROLLARY 2. - Let I be a real interval of length H \u2265 1.

Further, let I be a\nfinite set, {yi }i\u2208I a sequence of integers and {ai }i\u2208I a sequence of complex numbers.

Therefore Card(X ) \u2212 1 \u2265\nCard(X )/2 and , using (1) of 2.1, Card(X )\u2212 1 \u2264 2P/\u03b4. These relations show that (1) holds when\nall the yi are 0.\nLet us suppose that atleast one of the yi is distinct from 0. Since the yi are integers, we have\nT \u2265 1. We then set \u01eb = 1/4T and note that \u01eb \u2264 1. Since \u03c6\u01eb (t) = \u03c6\u01eb (\u2212t), for any real number x\nwe have the relation\n(2)\nFrom (2) we deduce that\n\n(3)\n\nX\n\nx\u2208X\n\nf (x) =\n\n\u03c6b\u01eb (y)e(xy) =\n\nXX\n\nai e(xyi ) =\n\nx\u2208X i\u2208I\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n\u03c6\u01eb (t \u2212 x)e(ty) dt.\nR\n\nX\n\nR\n\n!\n\n\u03c6\u01eb (t \u2212 x)\n\nx\u2208X\n\nSince X is a subset of [\u2212P, P ] and \u01eb \u2264 1, it follows that\n\nP\n\nx\u2208X\n\nX\ni\u2208I\n\nai\n\u03c6b\u01eb (yi )\n\n!\n\ne(tyi )\n\ndt.\n\n\u03c6\u01eb (t \u2212 x) vanishes outside the\n\ninterval [\u2212[P ] \u2212 2, [P ] + 2].
