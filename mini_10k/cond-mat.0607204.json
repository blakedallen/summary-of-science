In contrast to previous\nstudy, we discovered the important role of spin relaxation, which tends to favor spiral exchange over\nthe oscillatory Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction. Finally, we discuss the physics origins\nof these two types of magnetic interactions.\nPACS numbers: 75.50.Pp, 75.30.Et, 72.25.Rb, 75.70.Cn\n\nThe goal to merge the functionalities of information processing and data storage in one single material has charmed researchers in the field of spintronics\nfor many years.[1, 2] One of the promising candidates\nis the diluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS), made of\nthe III-V host semiconductor doped with transition metals, such as (Ga,Mn)As. The ferromagnetic order in\nDMS[3, 4, 5, 6, 7] arises from the aligned magnetic moments of the transition metals, mediated by itinerant carriers in the semiconducting bands and thus can be easily\nmanipulated by electrical means. This unique feature has\nattracted enormous interests both in academic research\nand potential industrial applications.\nIn addition to its potential applications for making\nthe next-generation transistors in spintronics, DMS also\nbrings up surprises in the more conventional magnetic\nmultilayers as shown in Fig. 1. One of the authors studied the F/DMS/F trilayer magnetic junction, within the\nlinear response theory[8] and the self-consistent Green's\nfunction approach[9, 10, 11], and found interesting spiral exchange coupling between the ferromagnets. Their\nnumerical results show that the spiral exchange always\nbeats the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction, rendering it into decorative ripples on the spiral backbones. Being puzzled by the dominance of the\nspiral exchange, we revisited the problem and found the\nimportant ingredient overlooked in the previous study \u2013\nthe proper inclusion of the spin relaxation rate.\nIn this Letter, employing the same model described in\nRef.[8], we studied the trilayer magnetic junction within\nlinear response theory. We carried out extensive numerical computations in different parameter regimes, in particular, with different spin relaxation rates \u03b7 (which was\nfixed in the previous study). We found that the competition between the spiral exchange and the RKKY interaction sensitively depends on the strength of spin relaxation. In the extreme ballistic limit, the RKKY interaction prevails, while the spiral exchange starts to take over\nthe leading role when approaching the diffusive regime.\nThe value of \u03b7 used in Ref.[8] happened to set the sys-\n\ny\nz\nx\nFerromagnet\n\nFerromagnet\n\nDMS\nq s (r)\nr\nFIG. 1: Schematic figure for the F/DMS/F trilayer magnetic\njunction, where the spiral angle \u03b8s (r) denotes the relative angle between the two ferromagnets.\n\ntem in the diffusive regime (see below) where the spiral\nexchange dominates. In general, depending on the spin\nrelaxation rate, it is possible to observe both types of\nmagnetic behaviors!\nBefore diving into numerical details, a simple argument\nfrom the single-particle picture would help readers to understand the origin of the spiral exchange. In fact, the argument closely parallels Datta-Das' original proposal[12]\nfor a spin field-effect transistor. Imagine an electron with\n+x spin orientation is injected into the DMS thin layer\nfrom the ferromagnet on the left-hand side. The two components of the wave function evolve differently because\nof the Zeeman splitting in DMS,\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 ik r \u0013\n1\n1\n1\ne F\u2191\n,\n(1)\n\u2192 \u03a8(r) = \u221a\n\u03a8(0) = \u221a\nik r\n2 1\n2 e F\u2193\nhere r is the thickness of the DMS thin layer. The phase\ndifference between the spinor components indicates that\nthe carrier-mediated exchange coupling is non-collinear\nand tends to align the other ferromagnet on the right\nat a different angle, \u03b8s (r) = \u22122\u03c0r/\u03bbs = \u2212(kF \u2191 \u2212 kF \u2193 )r.\nHowever, this simple single-particle picture may not be\nthe whole story because it does not capture the quantum\ninterferences from different patches of the whole Fermi\nsurface, which give rise to the oscillatory RKKY interac-\n\n\f2\ntion. Therefore, to pin down the dominant magnetic interaction, one needs to resort to the more formal Green's\nfunction approach.\nAfter integrating out the itinerant carriers, it can be\nshown that the effective exchange coupling between the\nferromagnets is proportional to the static spin susceptibility,\nZ \u221e\nij\ne\u2212\u03b7t hhi[\u03c3 i (~r, t), \u03c3 j (0, 0)]iidt,\n(2)\n\u03c7 (r) =\n0\n\nwhere \u03c3 i is the spin density in DMS layer and the double\nbracket denotes thermal and quantum mechanical averages. Note that the vector dependence can be dropped\nbecause of the external SO(3) symmetry for the spatial\ncoordinates (not to be confused with the internal SO(2)\nsymmetry for the spinor). Furthermore, a phenomenology parameter \u03b7 is introduced to describe the spin relaxation in DMS layer.\nIn the presence of the finite Zeeman gap, the spinor has\nan internal SO(2) symmetry. Consider a \u03c0/2-rotation\nalong the z-axis (always chosen to be the quantization\naxis for the Zeeman splitting). It changes (Sx , Sy ) \u2192\n(Sy , \u2212Sx ) and leaves Sz intact, implying \u03c7xy = \u2212\u03c7yx\nand \u03c7xx = \u03c7yy . Similar argument leads to \u03c7xz = 0 =\n\u03c7yz . For general geometries, the orientation of the pinned\nferromagnet can be nL = (sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6, sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6, cos \u03b8).\nMediated by the itinerant carriers, it will lock the free\nmagnetic moment on the right-hand side in the direction\nof nR ,\n\uf8ee x \uf8f9 \uf8ee xx\n\uf8f9\uf8ee x \uf8f9\nnR\n\u03c7\n\u03c7xy 0\nnL\n\uf8f0 nyR \uf8fb = \uf8f0 \u2212\u03c7xy \u03c7xx 0 \uf8fb \uf8f0 nyL \uf8fb .\n(3)\nnzR\n0\n0 \u03c7zz\nnzL\nSince our focus here is to determine the dominance of\ndifferent magnetic interactions, we choose the simplest\ngeometry in Fig. 1 by setting nL = (1, 0, 0). Thus, it\nis clear that nR can be described by the spiral angle\n\u03b8s (r) = \u2212 tan\u22121 [\u03c7xy (r)/\u03c7xx (r)]. To find out the spiral\nangle, we use the well-known trick to compute the complex susceptibility \u03c7+\u2212 = \u03c7xx + i\u03c7xy , then extract the\ndesired real and imaginary parts,\n\u03c7+\u2212 (r) =\n\nX f\u2191 (\u01ebk ) \u2212 f\u2193 (\u01ebk\u2032 )\n~ ~\u2032\nei(k\u2212k )*~r ,\n\u01ebk \u2212 \u01ebk\u2032 \u2212 \u2206 + i\u03b7\n\u2032\n\n(4)\n\nkk\n\nwhere \u01ebk = k 2 /2m\u2217 is the dispersion for itinerant carriers\nand \u2206 is the Zeeman gap. The Fermi-Dirac functions for\nthe itinerant carriers are f\u03b1 (\u01ebk ) = [exp(\u01ebk \u2212 \u03b1\u2206 \u2212 \u03bc) +\n1]\u22121 , with \u03b1 = \u00b1 corresponding to up/down spin flavors.\nWhen carrying out numerical calculations for the spin\nsusceptibility, we found that \u03c7xy \u223c \u03b7 2 vanishes as \u03b7 \u2192\n0+ . It implies that RKKY dominates in the ideal ballistic\nlimit. Actually, in this limit, the spin-spin commutator\nin Eq. (2) can be computed analytically and is indeed\nzero. We later realized that this result is due to a less\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\nFIG. 2: Spiral angle \u03b8s (r) for (a) k\u2206 /kF = 0.5 (b) k\u2206 /kF =\n1.0 (c) k\u2206 /kF = 1.3 in the ballistic regime with k\u03b7 /kF = 0.23.\n\nobvious time-reversal symmetry within each spin flavor.\nIt gives rise to the modified Onsager relation \u03c7xy = \u03c7yx\nand forces the off-diagonal component \u03c7xy = 0 in the\nideal ballistic limit. In Ref.[8], the authors only chose\none particular \u03b7 for their numerical computations (which\nhappens to be in the diffusive regime). Therefore, their\nconclusions are incorrect in the extreme ballistic limit.\nIn realistic materials, the spin relaxation rate \u03b7 is finite and the symmetry constraint no longer applies. By\ngradually increasing \u03b7 from the ballistic to the diffusive\nregimes, we show how the trend of the spiral angle \u03b8s (r)\nchanges with it, as summarized in\n\u221a Figs. 2 and 3. For\nconvenience, we introduce k\u2206 \u2261 2m\u2217 \u2206 to denote\n\u221a the\ninverse-length scale for the Zeeman gap and k\u03b7 \u2261 2m\u2217 \u03b7\nfor spin relaxation. The total density of the itinerant carriers is also converted to kF . In DMS, k\u2206 has a sensitive\ndependence on the temperature through the Zeeman gap\n\n\f3\nto the complicated patterns of the spiral angle \u03b8s (r).\nTo explore the role of spin relaxation, we also extend\nour calculations to the diffusive regime k\u03b7 /kF = 1 as\nshown in Fig. 3. The spiral exchange becomes significantly enhanced, rendering the oscillatory parts into decorative ripples. This can be understood as the decease of\nthe time-reversal symmetry which is broken by the large\nspin relaxation rate. Note that the RKKY oscillations\ncome from quantum interferences between the patches\nof the Fermi surfaces related by time-reversal symmetry.\nThus, by breaking the symmetry, it is very efficient to\nweaken the RKKY interaction, as demonstrated by our\nnumerical results. We would like to emphasize that the\nprevious study fails to recognize the important role of the\nspin relaxation and thus misses out the subtle competition between the spiral exchange and the RKKY interaction completely.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\nFIG. 3: \u03b8s (r) for k\u03b7 /kF = 1.0 in the diffusion regime: (a)\n(k\u2206 /kF ) = 0.5, (b) (k\u2206 /kF ) = 1.0.\n\nand can be as large as (or larger than) kF (roughly 1/nm\nin typical DMS materials) at low temperatures. Furthermore, the spin lifetime is about 10\u22122 picosecond, giving\nthe ratio k\u03b7 /kF \u2248 0.23.\nMaking use of this rough estimate, we compute the\nspiral angle with different Zeeman splitting k\u2206 , shown in\nFig. 2. When the polarization is small (k\u2206 /kF = 0.5),\nthe signature of RKKY oscillations is rather obvious.\nOn the other hand, when the carriers are fully polarized\n(k\u2206 /kF = 1.3), the spiral rotation becomes transparent\nand the RKKY oscillations, although visible, are suppressed into minor ripples. Careful analysis shows that\nthese complicated patterns for the spiral angle can be\ncharacterized by two length scales,\n\u03bbRKKY =\n\n2\u03c0\n,\nkF \u2191 + kF \u2193\n\n\u03bbs =\n\n2\u03c0\n.\nkF \u2191 \u2212 kF \u2193\n\n(5)\n\nThese length scales originate from the low-energy spin excitations. Consider the particle-hole excitation by kicking\na spin-down electron to the spin-up band. It will carry\nmomentum p~ = ~kF \u2191 \u2212 ~kF \u2193 . The length scale \u03bbs arises\nfrom excitations with kF \u2191 and kF \u2193 parallel, while \u03bbRKKY\ncomes from those with antiparallel momenta. The competition between these two type of spin excitations leads\n\nIn conclusion, we demonstrate the important role of\nspin relaxation in the trilayer magnetic junction and compute the spiral angle between the ferromagnetic layers\nwith different carrier concentrations, (temperature dependent) magnetizations and spin relaxation rates. Our\nnumerical studies show the non-collinear coupling across\na DMS thin film is important and will play a crucial\nrole for magnetic junctions at nanoscale.
