INTRODUCTION\n\nRecently, the Cosmic Ray Energetics And Mass\n(CREAM) has directly observed the CR compositions\nwith high statistics in the wide energy range up to\nabout 1014 eV. Interestingly, CREAM shows Np (E) \u221d\nE \u22122.66\u00b10.02 for CR proton and NHe (E) \u221d E \u22122.58\u00b10.02\nfor CR helium in the energy region 2.5 \u00d7 1012 eV\u2013\n2.5 \u00d7 1014 eV, that is, the spectrum of CR helium is\nharder than that of CR proton (Ahn et al. 2010). Although the difference of the spectral index \u2206s \u2248 0.08\nappears small, the implications are of great importance\nas shown below. In addition, the spectral index becomes\nhard by \u223c 0.12 for CR proton and by \u223c 0.16 for CR helium at & 2\u00d71011 eV/n because the Alpha Magnet Spectrometer (AMS) shows Np (E) \u221d E \u22122.78\u00b10.009 for the CR\nproton (Alcaraz et al. 2000a) and NHe (E) \u221d E \u22122.74\u00b10.01\nfor CR helium (Alcaraz et al. 2000b) in the low-energy\nrange 1010 eV\u20131011 eV. These results have been already\nobtained by the Advanced Thin Ionization Calorimeter-2\n(ATIC-2) (Panov et al. 2009).\nFor CR electrons, the Fermi gamma-ray space telescope has recently observed the spectrum of CR electrons in the wide energy range from 7 \u00d7 109 eV to\n1012 eV (Ackermann et al. 2010). Fermi shows that the\nobserved date can be fitted by a power law with spectral index in the interval 3.03 \u2212 3.13 and the spectral\nhardening at about 1011 eV, which may have the same\norigin as that of the CR nuclei. (For other models, see,\ne.g., Kashiyama et al. 2010; Kawanaka et al. 2010; Ioka\n2010, and references therein). Note that we do not discuss CR positrons in this letter.\nSupernova remnants (SNRs) are thought as the origin of the Galactic CRs. The most popular acceleration\nmechanism at SNRs is the diffusive shock acceleration\n(DSA) (Axford et al. 1977; Krymsky 1977; Bell 1978;\nBlandford & Ostriker 1978). In fact, Fermi and AGILE show that middle-age SNRs interacting with molec-\n\nular clouds emit gamma-rays (e.g. Abdo et al. 2009;\nTavani et al. 2010) and the gamma-ray observations support that SNRs produce the bulk of Galactic CRs (e.g.,\nOhira et al. 2011; Li & Chen 2010).\nAccording to DSA theory, the spectrum of accelerated\nparticles at a shock does not depend on CR elements,\nbut depends only on the velocity profile of the shock.\nThus, naively, recent CR observations seem to show that\nthe acceleration site of CR helium is different from that\nof CR proton (Biermann et al. 2010). However, in this\ndifferent site scenario, it should be by chance that the observed ratio of CR helium and proton, NHe /Np , at 109 eV\nis similar to the cosmic abundance (Y = 0.25). Furthermore, the difference of the spectral index \u2206s \u2248 0.08\nmeans that NHe /Np at 1014 eV is about 3 times higher\nthan that at 109 eV. This enhancement is amazing since\nthe mean helium abundance in the universe is virtually\nmaintained constant. The stellar nucleosynthesis never\nenhances the mean helium abundance by a factor, which\nis the essential reason that the big bang nucleosynthesis\nis indispensable for the cosmic helium abundance. To\nmake the enhancement, we should consider inhomogeneous abundance regions. We show that this leads to\nthe different spectrum of CR proton and helium when\nescaping from SNRs.\nIn this letter, considering the inhomogeneous abundance region, we provide a new explanation about (1)\nthe different spectrum of CR proton and helium, even\nif CR proton and helium are accelerated simultaneously.\nOur idea uses the fact that CRs escaping from SNRs generally have a different spectrum than that of the acceleration site (Ptsuskin & Zirakashvili 2005; Ohira et al.\n2010; Caprioli et al. 2010). The runaway CR spectrum\ndepends on not only the acceleration spectrum at shocks\nbut also the evolution of the maximum energy and the\nnumber of accelerated CRs (Ohira et al. 2010). We also\nsuggest that (2) the spectral hardening of CRs is caused\nby the decreasing Mach number in the high tempera-\n\n\f2\n\nOhira and Ioka\n\nNumber\n\nE\n\n-s\n\nlow-energy CRs.

The solid line of the\nrunaway CR spectrum represents the equation (3). A variable \u03c7\n(e.g., the shock radius) describes the SNR evolution.\n\nture medium. Both the inhomogeneous abundance and\nthe high temperature can be realized in the superbubbles\nwith multiple supernovae. Our conclusions are summarized as follows.\n\u2022 Runway CR spectra depend on not only CR spectra inside the SNR but also the evolution of the\nmaximum energy and the number of accelerated\nCRs. Therefore, taking account of the inhomogeneous abundance region, runaway CR spectra of\ndifferent CR elements have different spectra (section 2 and 3.1).\n\u2022 Our model is in excellent agreement with observed\nspectra of CR proton and helium. Harder spectrum of CR helium is due to the enhancement of\nthe helium abundance around the explosion center.\nOn the other hand, the concave spectra of all CR\nelements are due to the decreasing Mach number in\nthe hot gas with \u223c 106 K. The concave spectra may\nbe also produced by the CR nonlinear effect, the energy dependent effects on the accelerated CRs (on\n\u03b1 or \u03b2), the propagation effect (\u03b3), and/or multi\ncomponents with different spectral indices (section\n3.2 and 4).\n\u2022 Within the single component scenario, the hard\nhelium spectrum suggests that the origin of the\nGalactic CR is SNRs in superbubbles, although\nwe are not excluding the multi component scenario\n(section 5).\n\u2022 Our model predicts that heavier (at least volatile)\nCR elements also have harder spectra than that of\nCR proton and have concave spectra (section 5).\n2. RUNAWAY CR SPECTRUM\n\nIn this section, we briefly review the runaway CR spectrum (see Appendix of Ohira et al. (2010)). We here use\na variable \u03c7 (for example the shock radius or the SNR\nage) to describe the evolution of an SNR. Let FSNR (\u03c7, p)\nand pmax (\u03c7) be the CR momentum spectrum [(eV/c)\u22121 ]\nand the maximum four momentum of CR inside the SNR\nat a certain epoch labeled by \u03c7, respectively. CRs escape\nin order, from the maximum energy CR because the diffusion length of high-energy CRs is larger than that of\n\nFSNR (\u03c7, pmax )\n\ndpmax\nd\u03c7 ,\nd\u03c7\n\n(1)\n\nwhich corresponds to the number of runaway CRs between p = pmax (\u03c7) and p = pmax (\u03c7) + dp, Fesc (p)dp.\nHence, Fesc (p) is\nFesc (p) = FSNR (p\u22121\nmax (p), p) ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere p\u22121\nmax (p) is the inverse function of pmax (\u03c7). Assuming FSNR (\u03c7, p) \u221d \u03c7\u03b2 p\u2212s and pmax (\u03c7) \u221d \u03c7\u2212\u03b1 , we obtain\nthe runaway CR spectrum as\nFesc (p) \u221d p\u2212(s+ \u03b1 ) ,\n\u03b2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are parameters to describe the evolution\nof maximum energy and the number of accelerated CRs,\nrespectively. (We use \u03b1 \u223c 6.5 and \u03b2 \u223c 1.5 later.) Therefore, the runaway CR spectrum Fesc is different from that\nin the SNR FSNR \u221d p\u2212s . Figure 1 shows the schematic\npicture of the runaway CR spectrum. In this Letter, we\nuse the shock radius, Rsh , as \u03c7.\nThe evolution of the maximum energy of CRs at\nthe SNR has not been understood. This strongly depends on the evolution of the magnetic field around\nthe shock (e.g. Ptsuskin & Zirakashvili 2003). Although\nsome magnetic field amplifications have been proposed\n(e.g., Lucek & Bell 2000; Bell 2004; Giacalone & Jokipii\n2007; Ohira et al. 2009b) and investigated by simulations\n(e.g., Niemiec et al. 2008; Riquelme & Spitkovsky 2009;\nOhira et al. 2009a; Gargat\u00e9 et al. 2010), the evolution of\nthe magnetic field has not been completely understood\nyet. Here we assume that CRs with the knee energy escape at R = RSedov , where RSedov is the shock radius\nat the beginning of the Sedov phase. Furthermore, we\nuse the phenomenological approach with the power-law\ndependence (Gabici et al. 2009; Ohira et al. 2010),\n\u0013\u2212\u03b1\n\u0012\nRsh\n,\n(4)\npmax (Rsh ) = pknee Z\nRSedov\nwhere pknee = 1015.5 eV/c is the four momentum of the\nknee energy. Note that \u03b1 does not depend on the CR\ncomposition because the evolution of the maximum energy depends only on the evolution of the magnetic field\nand the shock velocity.\nThe evolution of the number of CRs inside the SNR\nhas not been also understood. This depends on the\ninjection mechanism (Ohira et al. 2010) and the density profile around the SNR. We here adopt the thermal leakage model (Malkov & V\u00f6lk 1995) as an injection model. For the total density profile, \u03c1tot (Rsh ) \u2248\nmp (np (Rsh ) + 4nHe (Rsh )) where np and nHe are the\nnumber density of proton and helium and mp is the proton mass, the shock velocity of the Sedov phase is\n1\n\n\u22123\n\nush (Rsh ) \u221d \u03c1tot (Rsh )\u2212 2 Rsh2 .\n\n(5)\n\nIn the thermal leakage model, the injection momentum\nof element i is proportional to the shock velocity, pinj,i \u221d\nush , and the number density of CR with momentum pinj,i\nis proportional to the density, p3inj,i fi (pinj,i ) \u221d ni (Rsh ),\nwhere fi is the distribution function of CR element i.\n\n\fCosmic Ray Helium Hardening\n\nLate shock\n\nDensity\n\nEarly shock\n\nHigh-energy proton\n\nnp\n\nrunaway CR spectra (See Section 4 for more details).\nFigure 2 shows the schematic picture of our idea.\n\nLow-energy proton\n\n3.2.

For the nonlinear\nDSA, the spectral index in the non-relativistic energy\nregion is different from that in the relativistic energy region (Berezhko & Ellison 1999). To understand the essential feature of the runaway CR spectrum, we here consider only the test-particle DSA, that is, slow = s. Be1\u2212s\ncause ni (Rsh )\u03c1tot (Rsh ) 2 is not always a single powerlaw form, the evolution of the number of accelerated CRs\ncan not be always described by a constant \u03b2.\n3.

Different spectrum of CR proton and helium\n\nAccording to the test particle DSA theory, the index s\nof relativistic CR energy spectrum depends only on the\nvelocity jump at the shock,\ns=\n\nM2 + 1\nu1 + 2u2\n=2 2\n,\nu1 \u2212 u2\nM \u22121\n\n(7)\n\nwhere we use the Rankine-Hugoniot relation at the second equation and M is the Mach number. Then, the\nindex of the runaway CR spectrum, sesc , is\nsesc = s +\n\n\u03b2\n,\n\u03b1\n\n(8)\n\nin equation (3). Therefore, if \u03b2/\u03b1 (in particular \u03b2, the index for the accelerated CR number evolution) is different,\nthe runaway CR spectrum is different between the CR\ncompositions. This is our main idea to explain the helium hardening observed by CREAM and ATIC-2. From\nequation (6), \u03b2 depends on the ambient number density\nni . Therefore, different density profiles make different\n\nwhere D(p) \u221d p is the diffusion coefficient (e.g.\nStrong et al. 2007). Hence, the index of the observed\nspectrum is\n\u03b2\nsobs = s + + \u03b3 .\n(10)\n\u03b1\nThe deviation from a single power law means that at\nleast one of s, \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 has an energy dependence\nor that the origin of low energy CRs below 1011 eV is\ndifferent from that of high energy CRs above 1011 eV.\nAlthough the multi component scenario may be the case\nbecause there are many types of SNRs, we discuss the\nsingle component scenario in this letter.\nFirstly, we discuss the energy dependence of s. From\nequation (7), s depends on the shock radius because the\nMach number M decreases with the shock radius. Then\nwe can expect the spectral harding of all CR compositions at the same rigidity cp/Ze, that is, at approximately the same energy per nucleon. From equation (5),\nthe Mach number is\n\u0013\u2212 21 \u0012\n\u0013\u2212 21 \u0012\n\u0013\u2212 23\n\u0012\nT\nRsh\n\u03c1tot (Rsh )\n3\n,\nM \u2248 10\n\u03c1tot (RSedov )\n104 K\nRSedov\n(11)\nwhere T is the surrounding temperature and we assume\nthat the ejecta mass and the energy of supernova explosion are 1 M\u2299 and 1051 erg, respectively. From equations (4), (7) and (11), we can obtain s as a function of\np (see \u00a7 4).\nAlternatively the spectral hardening can be also interpreted as the CR nonlinear effect (e.g., Drury & V\u00f6lk\n1981; Malkov & Drury 2001). This issue will be addressed in the future work.\nNext, we discuss the energy dependence of \u03b2 that is\nthe parameter to describe the evolution of the number\nof accelerated CRs. In Section 3.1, we consider different\npower-law forms for np (Rsh ) and nHe (Rsh ) to make the\ndifferent spectrum of the CR proton and helium. Therefore, \u03c1tot (Rsh ) \u2248 mp [np (Rsh ) + 4nHe (Rsh )] is not a single\npower law form, and \u03b2 has an energy dependence (see\n\u00a7 4).\nThe energy dependence of \u03b3 will be soon precisely determined by AMS-02 (Pato et al. 2010). We do not discuss the energy dependence of \u03b1 because the complete\nphysics of the CR escape and magnetic turbulence is beyond the scope of this Letter.\n4.

In this model,\nall parameters are \u03b1, \u03b3, \u03b4, \u01eb, T , Fp,knee .\nFigure 3 shows the comparison of our model with\nobservations. We take into account the solar modulation effects with the modulation potential \u03a6 = 450 MV\n(Gleeson & Axford 1968). Our model is in excellent\nagreement with the observed spectra, with \u03b1 = 6.5,\n\u03b3 = 0.43, \u03b4 = 0.715, \u01eb = 0.31, T = 106 K. The different spectra of CR proton and helium originate from\nthe different density profiles in equations (12). Figure 4\nshows the evolution of the maximum energy of CRs and\nthe spectral index of CRs inside the SNR. In the early\nphase, the spectral index s is 2 and after then, the spectral index decreases with the shock radius because the\nMach number decreases with shock radius. The change\nof spectral index s is about 0.1 which is almost the same\nas the observed hardening. The observed hardening is\nnot the result of the change of the injection history, \u03b2,\nbut the result of spectral change of CRs inside the SNR.\nThe high temperature T \u223c 106 K is necessary for the\nspectral hardening \u2206s \u223c 0.1.\nIn addition, our model also makes a concave spectrum\nof CR electrons as observed (Ackermann et al. 2010).\nHowever, the evolution of injection efficiency of CR electrons has not been understood well. So we need further\nstudies to discuss the CR electron spectrum in detail.\n\n(12)\n\nwhere np,0 is the number density of proton at Rsh =\nRSedov , and \u03b6np,0 is the normalization factor of the helium density. We set \u03b6 = 106.5(\u03b4/\u03b1)\u22121 so that the helium\nabundance is that of the solar abundance, nHe /np = 0.1\n(i.e., Y \u2248 0.25), when cpmax = Z GeV with equation\n(4). Note that the power-law dependence is a first step\napproximation for the mean value. Then, from equations (2), (4), (6), (9), observed spectra of CR proton\nand helium are\n) 1\u2212s(p)\n(\n\u03b4\n2\n1 + \u03b6 (p/pknee ) \u03b1\nFobs,p = Fp,knee\n1+\u03b6\n\u0012\n\u0013\u2212[s(p)+ 3{3\u2212s(p)}\n+\u03b3 ]\n2\u03b1\np\n\u00d7\n, (13)\npknee\n) 1\u2212s(p)\n(\n\u03b4\n2\n1 + \u03b6 (p/Zpknee) \u03b1\nFobs,He = \u01ebFp,knee\n1+\u03b6\n\u0013\u2212[s(p)+ 3{3\u2212s(p)}\u22122\u03b4\n\u0012\n+\u03b3 ]\n2\u03b1\np\n(14),\n\u00d7\nZpknee\n\nTo make the different spectrum, our model requires\nthat the helium abundance around the explosion center is higher than that of the solar abundance. SNRs\nin superbubbles are one of candidates. Higdon et al.\n(1998) show that supernova ejecta can dominate the\nsuperbubble mass within a core radius of one third of\nthe superbubble radius. In the stellar wind and the\nsupernova explosion, the stellar hydrogen envelope has\nlower density and higher velocity than that of helium.\nThen we expect that the helium fraction in the center of superbubbles is higher than that in the outer region. Furthermore, to make the concave spectrum, our\nmodel requires an ambient medium with high temperature, T = 106 K. This is also consistent with superbubbles. According to the CR composition study,\nSNRs in superbubbles have been considered as the origin of Galactic CRs (e.g., Lingenfelter & Higdon 2007;\nOgliore et al. 2009). Particle accelerations in superbubbles have been also investigated by intensive studies (e.g., Bykov & Fleishman 1992; Parizot et al. 2004;\nDar & De R\u00fajula 2008; Ferrand & Marcowith 2010).\nWe here considered a spherically symmetric system. The\noff-center effects may be important for the initial phase\nand thereby for the high energy spectrum, because the\nshock radius at the beginning of the Sedov phase RSedov\nis about 20 pc which is comparable to the typical size\nof OB association, 35 pc (Parizot et al. 2004), and the\nshock radius Rsh is about 200 pc at the end of the Sedov\nphase. This is an interesting future problem.\nNote that the spectral hardening can be also made by\nthe nonlinear model, the energy dependence of the CR\ndiffusion coefficient and/or multi components with different spectral indices. So the high temperature may not\nbe absolutely necessary. The stellar wind of red giants is\n\n\fCosmic Ray Helium Hardening\none of candidates for the cold and helium rich ambient.\nStill, the dominant core-collapse supernovae is type II\n(e.g., Smartt et al. 2009) which has no helium rich wind,\nso that the superbubble scenario looks more likely as the\norigin of the Galactic CRs above 1011 eV. For the CRs\nbelow 1011 eV, the spectral difference between CR proton and helium may be caused by the solar modulation\nand the inelastic interactions (Putze et al. 2010).\nThe spatial variation of the helium ionization degree\ncan also change the injection history. The injection efficiency of the large rigidity is thought to be higher than\nthat of low rigidity since particles with large rigidity can\neasily penetrate through the shock front from the downstream region. If the ionization degree increases with the\nSNR radius, the CR helium spectrum becomes harder\nthan the CR proton one, \u03b2He < \u03b2p . However, the rigidity\ndependence of the injection efficiency has not been understood completely. Moreover, the injection from neutral\nparticles should also be understood (Ohira et al. 2009b,\n2010).\nAccording to our model, CR spectra of heavier volatile\nelements than helium is also harder than that of proton.\nLow-energy CRs of refractory elements are thought to result from suprathermal injection by sputtering off preaccelerated, high-velocity grains (Ellision et al. 1997). To\nbe accelerated to the relativistic energy, the refractory\nelements should be sputtered because the grains can not\nbe accelerated to the relativistic energy. The SNR shock\n\n5\n\nvelocity is not fast enough to accelerate refractory elements to the knee energy when the refractory elements\nare injected because the sputtering time scale is too long.\nTherefore, refractory CRs around the knee energy should\nbe injected by the standard manner similar to volatile\nCRs. In this case, the refractory CRs also have harder\nspectra than protons, although we need further studies\nof the injection of refractory CRs at the knee energy.\nIf CRs trapped inside the SNR and released at the end\nof the SNR's life outnumber runaway CRs (see figure\n3 in Caprioli et al. (2010)), our scenario does not work\nfor producing hard and concave spectra. In our model\nwith \u03b1 \u223c 6.5 in Eq. (4), trapped CRs have energy below\n1 GeV when they are released, that is, pmax . Zmp c\nwhen Rsh & 10RSedov , and are not relevant for our interest. Higher energy CRs escape from the SNR even\nafter advected to the downstream since the CR diffusion\nis faster than the expansion of the SNR. Our case is similar to the right figure 7 in Caprioli et al. (2010) where\ntrapped CRs are released below 100 GeV. The energy\nboundary between trapped CRs and runaway CRs depends on the evolution of the maximum energy (\u03b1).\nWe thank the referee, T. Suzuki, T. Terasawa and A.\nBamba for comments.
