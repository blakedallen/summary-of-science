K. Chaudhuri\u2217\n\narXiv:nucl-th/0312069v3 12 May 2004\n\nVariable Energy Cyclotron Centre\n1/AF,Bidhan Nagar, Kolkata - 700 064\nIn a pQCD-based model, we have analyzed the STAR and PHENIX\ndata on the high pT suppres\u221a\nsion of charged hadrons and neutral pions, in Au+Au collisions at s=200 GeV. In the jet quenching\nor the energy loss picture, pT dependence of the nuclear modification factor of the charged hadrons\nand neutral pions, in all the centrality ranges, are well explained in terms of a single parameter, the\naverage relative energy loss < \u2206E/E >. < \u2206E/E > increases with the centrality, from a small or\nnear zero value in the most peripheral collisions, it increases to \u223c 20-22% in most central collisions.\nHowever, a part of the increased energy loss with centrality, is due to geometric effect, i.e. increased\npath length in central than in peripheral collisions. If the geometric part of the energy loss is excluded, the extracted energy loss reveals that even in central collisions, the density of matter is not\nvery high. It is only 1.5-2.0 times the normal nuclear matter density. Our analysis thus precludes\nformation of high-density matter in central Au+Au collisions.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nOne of the predictions of quantum chromodynamics is the possible existence of a deconfined state of quarks and\ngluons. In relativistic heavy ion collisions, under certain conditions (sufficiently high energy density and temperature)\nordinary hadronic matter (where quarks and gluons are confined) can undergo a phase transition to a deconfined\nmatter, commonly known as quark gluon plasma (QGP). Over the years, nuclear physicists are trying to produce and\ndetect this new phase of matter, first at CERN SPS and now at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). At RHIC\nseveral new results are obtained, most important among them is the high pT suppression in Au+Au collisions and its\nabsence in d+Au collisions. All the four experiments,\n\u221a STAR, PHENIX, PHOBOS\n\u221a and BRAHMS [1\u20134] observed that\nhigh pT hadron production in Au+Au collisions at s = 200 GeV (as well as at s = 130GeV), scaled by the average\nnumber of binary collisions, is suppressed with respect to pp collisions. The suppression is more in central collisions\nthan in peripheral collisions. The observation has created an excitement in nuclear physics community, as a possible\nsignature, if not of QGP, of creation of highly dense matter in central Au+Au collisions.\nOne of the explanations offered for the high pT suppression at RHIC is the jet quenching [5,6]. In the fragmentation\npicture [7], the single parton spectrum is convoluted with the probability for a parton i to hadronize into a hadron\nh, which carries a fraction z < 1 of the momentum of the parent parton. Unlike in pp collisions, in AA collisions,\npartons produced in the initial hard scattering has to propagate through a medium before fragmentation. While\npropagating through the medium, the partons can suffer energy loss through multiple scattering. As a results, at the\ntime of fragmentation to hadrons, the partons will have less energy and consequently will produce less hadrons than\nwould have otherwise. Due to increased path length, partons will suffer more energy loss in central collisions than in\nperipheral collisions. The jet quenching or energy loss picture thus predicts more high pT suppression is central than\nin peripheral collisions, in agreement with the experimental observation.\nPartonic energy loss in a medium is a complex phenomena. Partons lose energy mainly due to gluon radiation.\nRecently, much progress has been made in the calculation of radiative energy loss of partons in medium, by several\nauthors and in different approaches [8\u201315]. However, exact nature of the energy loss is still uncertain. For example, in\nthe BDMS [9,10] relative energy loss increases rapidly with decreasing energy, \u2206E/E \u221d 1/E, but in GLV [11] relative\nenergy loss is approximately constant. However, all the models agree that in a static medium, energy loss due to\ngluon radiation have a characteristic quadratic dependence on the in medium path length. In an one dimensionally\nexpanding medium, the quadratic dependence is diluted to a linear dependence [12].\nIn the jet quenching or the energy loss picture, several authors have studied high pT production at RHIC energy in\nAu+Au collisions [15\u201321]. The LO or NLO pQCD models with jet quenching can well explain the high pT suppression,\nimplying large parton energy loss or high initial gluon density. In [15] gluon density, at an initial time \u03c40 = 0.2 fm was\nestimated to be 15 times higher than that in a normal nuclear matter.\nApart from the jet quenching, alternative explanations are also offered for the high pT suppression. Indeed, leading\nhadrons from the jet fragmentation can possibly have strong interactions with the medium created and possibly be\n\n\fabsorbed or its pT be shifted to lower values leading to the high pT suppression. In [22] high pT suppression, due\nto final state hadronic interactions, was considered. It was argued that partons cannot materialize into hadrons in a\ndeconfined phase. Fragmentation can occur only outside the deconfined phase or in vacuum. It was argued that high\npT (pre-)hadrons can well be realized inside the late stage of the fireball. Then interaction of the (pre-)hadrons with\nbulk hadronic matter could lead to the observed suppression. RHIC data on high pT suppression can be partially\nexplained in the model. Final state hadronic interaction was also used by Capella et al [23] to explain the high pT\nsuppression. In their model, high pT hadrons interact with the comovers and their pT is shifted to smaller values. Due\nto steepness of the pT distribution the effect could be large. Indeed, it was shown that RHIC data are well explained\nin such a model [23].\nRecently Xin-Nian [20] has argued strongly against models using the final state hadronic interaction to explain\nRHIC high pT suppression. He argued that hadron formation time could not be small, rather large, in the range\nof 30-40 fm, much larger than the typical medium size or lifetime of the dense medium. Moreover, nearly flat pT\ndependence of the observed suppression at high pT empirically leads to a linear energy dependence of the hadronic\nenergy loss. Since the hadron formation time is proportional to hadron or jet energy, the total energy loss due to\nhadron rescattering or absorption decreases with energy. He argued that observed high pT suppression at RHIC could\nonly be due to partonic energy loss.\nAs told earlier, jet quenching or partonic energy loss does explain the observed high PT suppression. In the jet\nquenching picture, one tries to deduce the density of the medium produced and also tries to comment on the question\nof thermalization of the medium. However, to comment about the medium where the partons undergo energy loss,\ncareful analysis is required to eliminate effects due to geometry of collisions. In the present paper we have analyzed\nthree data sets on high pT suppression, (i) STAR data on charged particle production, (ii) PHENIX data on neutral\npions and (iii) PHENIX data on charged hadrons. Considering the existing differences in model calculations of energy\nloss, we took a simplistic approach. We assume that in a certain centrality range, partons suffer, on the average,\n< \u2206E > energy loss. Then treating the average energy loss as a parameter, we fit the experimental data. As will be\nshown below, both the STAR and PHENIX data on nuclear modification factor, in all the centrality ranges, are well\nexplained in terms of a single parameter, the average relative energy loss < \u2206E/E >. From the centrality dependence\nof the extracted relative energy loss we then try to learn about the medium in which the partons suffered the energy\nloss.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows: In section 2, we have described the pQCD model for hadron production. In\nsection 3, results of our analysis of STAR and PHENIX data are presented. Summary and conclusions are given in\nsection 4.\n\nII. PQCD MODEL FOR HADRON PRODUCTION\n\nDetails of high pT hadron production in pp collisions could be found in [24].

Here, the parameter K takes into account the higher order corrections.\nFor the partonic collisions ij \u2192 kl, x1 and x2 are the fractional momentum of the colliding partons i and j, x1,2 =\npT\n\u221a\n(e\u00b1y1 + e\u00b1y2 ), y1 and y2 being the rapidities of the two final state partons k and l. For the parton distribution,\ns\nf (x, Q2 ), we have used the CTEQ5L parton distribution, with the factorization scale Q2 \u2248 p2T . In Eq.1, d\u03c3\u0302 ab\u2212>cd /dt is\nthe sub process Cross-section. Only 8 sub processes contribute, they are listed in [25]. Dh (z, \u03bc2 ) is the fragmentation\nfunction for the final state partons. Fragmentation functions are defined as energy fraction distribution 1/\u03c3total d\u03c3 h /dx\nfor the hadron h in the reaction e+ + e\u2212 \u2192 h + X. They are not calculable, as formation of hadrons is nonperturbative. What is done in practice is to assume a form for the fragmentation function and fit experimental data\non hadron production in e+ e\u2212 collisions. Fragmentation functions are scale dependent. Effect of increasing scale is\nto shift the fragmentation function towards lower values of z. Knowing the fragmentation function at some scale,\n\n\fit is possible to obtain it at any other scale using Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (GLAP) equation. In the present\ncalculation,\nused KPP parameterization\n[26] with fragmentation scale \u03bc2 \u2248 qT2 .

In this picture,\nall the nuclear information is contained in the thickness function, TA (b) = \u03c1(b, z)dz. We have used Woods-Saxon\nform for the density \u03c1(r),\n\u03c1(r) =\n\n\u03c10\n1 + e(r\u2212R)/a\n\n(4)\n\nR\nFor Au, R = 6.38f m and a = 0.535f m. The central density \u03c10 is obtained from the normalizing condition, \u03c1(r)d3 r =\nA.\nThe key element in the jet quenching or energy loss picture is the fragmentation function Dh (z, Q2 ). Unlike in\npp collisions, in AA collisions, final state partons, before fragmentation, can travel a distance (L) through nuclear\nmatter and in the process can lose energy. Then at the time of fragmentation, it has less energy. For energy loss \u2206E,\nz\n. As the fragmentation functions are peaked\nz = Eh /Eparton in the fragmentation function is changed to z \u2217 \u2192 1\u2212\u2206E/E\nat low z, with energy loss, fragmentation will produce less number of hadrons than otherwise. Implementation of jet\nquenching in pQCD models is straightforward. While calculating the spectra for AA collisions, the fragmentation\nfunction Di\u2192h (z) in Eq.1 is replaced such that,\nzDi\u2192h (z) = z \u2217 Di\u2192h (z\u2217)\n\n(5)\n\nwith z \u2217 = z/(1 \u2212 \u2206E/E).\nIn a nuclear medium, structure function fa/A is also changed, the so-called EMC effect. We have taken account of\nEMC effect through HIJING parameterization. However, its effect is small.\nSTAR and PHENIX collaboration measured the nuclear effects on the inclusive spectra, in different centrality\nranges via the nuclear modification factor, defined as,\nRAA =\n\nd2 N/dpT dy(Au + Au)\nTAA d2 \u03c3/dpT dy(pp)\n\n(6)\n\nwhere TAA =< Nbin > /\u03c3inel from a Glauber calculation accounts for the nuclear collision geometry. The nuclear\nmodification factor will be unity, had there been no nuclear effects on high pT production. In central collisions, both\nthe STAR and the PHENIX data show considerable nuclear effects (RAA < 1).\nFor simplicity, we have assumed that in each centrality ranges, partons suffer on the average < \u2206E > energy.\nTreating the average relative energy loss < \u2206E/E > as a parameter, we fit the STAR and PHENIX data on nuclear\nmodification factor. The fitting was done using the CERN MINUIT minimizing program.\nIII. RESULTS\n\nIn Fig.1a, the pT spectra for charged hadrons in pp collisions, as obtained by the STAR collaboration is shown.\nSTAR collaboration counted only \u03c0 \u00b1 , K \u00b1 and p\u00b1 as charged hadron and in the calculation also, we have included\nthose hadrons only. The solid line in Fig.1a, is the fit obtained to the data in the model. We have fitted only the\nhigh pT part (pT > 4 GeV) of the spectra. The LO pQCD give reasonably good description of the data. In Fig.1b,\nwe have shown the ratio of data to pQCD model calculation. High pT part of the spectra is explained within 20%.\nWe note that better description will be obtained using generalized parton distribution, however, at the expense of an\nadditional parameter < kT2 > [27].\n\n\fIn Fig.2, in six panels, we have shown the STAR data on nuclear modification factor (RAA ). The solid lines are\nthe fit obtained in the present model. Here also we have used only the pT > 4GeV part of the spectra for the fitting\npurpose. We note that we are neglecting the Cronin effect. However, at high pT Cronin effect is small. The high pT\npart of the STAR nuclear modification factor, in all the centrality ranges are well explained. pQCD with jet quenching\nor the energy loss can explain the spectacular STAR data on nuclear modification factor, with a single parameter,\nthe relative energy loss < \u2206E/E >. Later we will discuss in detail the relative energy loss in STAR data and its\nimplications, for the present, we just mention that in most central collisions (0-5% centrality), experimental RAA\nrequire that the partons, on the average suffer 20% energy loss, (< \u2206E/E >\u223c 0.2). Energy loss gradually decreases\nfor less central collisions and the most peripheral collisions (60-80% centrality) are consistent with no energy loss.\nIndeed, high pT part of RAA as obtained by the STAR collaboration in the centrality range 60-80% is consistent with\nno nuclear effect.\nAs mentioned earlier, we have also analyzed the PHENIX data for the charged hadrons and neutral pions. In\nFig.3 and 4, the nuclear modification factor for the charged hadrons and neutral pions, as obtained by the PHENIX\ncollaboration are shown. The fit obtained in the model, with the single parameter < \u2206E/E >, are also shown in the\nfigures. As for the STAR data, both the PHENIX data are also well explained in the model. Extracted energy losses\nalso show similar variation with centrality. However, while STAR data require zero or very small energy loss for the\nmost peripheral collisions, both the PHENIX data require finite (\u223c5%) energy loss even in most peripheral collisions.\nIndeed as can be seen from the figures, in the most peripheral collisions, while high pT part of STAR RAA show little\nor no nuclear effect, PHENIX data show definite nuclear effect. Presently we do not understand the reason for this\ndifference.\nExtracted average relative energy loss < \u2206E/E > from STAR and PHENIX data are shown in Fig.5, as a function\nof number of binary collisions (centrality). < \u2206E/E > extracted from STAR and PHENIX show similar centrality\ndependence. In peripheral collisions energy loss is less, increasing with the centrality. In most central collisions,\napproximately partons on the average suffer \u223c20% energy loss. Extracted < \u2206E/E > from PHENIX neutral pion\nand charged hadrons are consistent with each other, but are consistently larger (5-20%) than the extracted energy loss\nfrom STAR data. As observed earlier also, even in the most peripheral collisions, PHENIX data are not consistent\nwith zero or small nuclear effects, as are the STAR data. In our analysis also, while we obtain nearly zero energy loss\nfor most peripheral STAR collisions, for PHENIX, finite value of energy loss is obtained.\nAs mentioned earlier, increased energy loss with centrality may have geometric origin. Simply due to increased\npath length, partons can suffer more energy loss in central than in peripheral collisions. To understand better the\ncentrality dependence of the extracted energy loss, using the Glauber model, we have calculated energy lose suffered\nby a partons as,\n< \u2206E > (b) = N (b)\u03b5\n\n(7)\n\nwhere N (b) is the average number of collisions suffered by the partons at impact parameter b and \u03b5 is the average\nenergy loss in each collisions.\nAt impact parameter b, the positions (s, z) and (b \u2212 s, z\u2032) specifies the initial hard scattering of partons. The\nnumber of collisions suffered by a parton after the initial hard scattering can be calculated as,\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\ndzB \u03c1(b \u2212 s, zB )\n(8)\nN (b, s, z, z\u2032) = \u03c3\ndzA \u03c1(s, zA ) + \u03c3\nz\n\nz\u2032\n\nwhere \u03c3 is the parton-nucleon cross section. Above expression should be averaged over all positions of initial hard\nscattering with a weight of the nuclear densities.\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\n2\n2\nN (b) = d s dz\u03c1A (s, z) dz\u2032\u03c1B (b \u2212 s, z\u2032)N (b, s, z, z\u2032)/ d s dz\u03c1A (s, z) dz\u2032\u03c1B (b \u2212 s, z\u2032)\n(9)\nIn Fig.5, the solid line is the Glauber model calculation of energy loss (suitably normalized). We note that simply\ndue to geometry of the collisions, even in cold nuclear matter, energy loss depend on the centrality. In central collisions,\nthe partons can travel a distance longer than in peripheral collisions, leading to more energy loss in central than in\nperipheral collisions. It will be unrealistic to associate this increased energy loss in central collisions with the medium\ndensity. Naturally, the energy loss extracted from the STAR and PHENIX data include the geometric effect and only\nby eliminating the geometric effect, can one comment on the nature of the medium. We note that Glauber model\ncalculation cannot reproduce the centrality dependence of the extracted energy loss in all the centrality ranges. While\nin peripheral collisions, Glauber model can account for the extracted energy loss, in more central collisions, energy\nloss is underpredicted by a factor of 1.5-2.0. In peripheral collisions, we do not expect any other medium than normal\nnuclear matter. Agreement of Glauber model calculation with the extracted energy loss in peripheral collisions then\n\n\fsuggests that in a peripheral collision, possibly normal nuclear matter is produced. On the same reasoning, failure\nof the Glauber model to account for the energy loss in central collisions indicate matter other than normal nuclear\nmatter is produced in central collisions. For central collisions, Glauber model predict 1.5-2.0 times less energy loss\nthan the extracted values. Energy loss in excess of Glauber model calculation can be attributed to dynamical origin.\nIf we assume that energy loss is proportional to the density, this would lead to 1.5-2.0 time higher density in central\ncollisions than in peripheral collisions. This is much less than the density (15 times normal density) obtained by Wang\nand Wang [15]. The present analysis thus precludes any high density formation in RHIC Au+Au collisions.\nPartons lose energy mainly due to gluon radiation. In a static medium, energy loss due to gluon radiation exhibit a\ncharacteristic quadratic dependence on the in medium path length L, \u2206E \u221d L2 . For a one dimensionally expanding\nmedium, the quadratic dependence gets diluted to a linear dependence [12]. In Fig.6, we have plotted the extracted\nenergy loss as a function of the in medium path length (L). Fit to the extracted energy loss with the parametric\nform, < \u2206E/E >= AL2 are also shown in Fig.6. Energy loss from the STAR data are well explained with A =\n6.24 \u00d7 10\u22123 f m\u22122 (the solid line). For the PHENIX experiment also, < \u2206E/E > in more central collisions are\nexplained by the quadratic form with A = 7.41 \u00d7 103 f m\u22122 , but under predict the energy loss in peripheral collisions.\nQuadratic dependence of the energy loss in central collisions on the in medium path length then suggests that partonic\nenergy loss is mainly due to gluon radiation in a static medium, i.e. they lose the energy before the expansion sets\nin. Hydrodynamic expansion sets in a time scale of 0.2-1.0 fm. The hadrons then are formed before that time scale.\nIt is very important result. If hadrons are formed in a time scale of 0-2-1.0 fm, they can possibly be absorbed in the\nresulting hadronic medium. They high pT suppression then may be due to the combined effect of jet quenching and\nhadronic interaction in medium.\nIV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\n\u221a To summarize, we have analyzed the STAR and PHENIX data on high pT suppression in Au+Au collisions at\ns=200 GeV. Assuming that in each centrality range, partons suffer on the average < \u2206E > energy loss, we have\nextracted the relative energy loss < \u2206E/E > from a fit to the experimental nuclear modification factor. Energy\nloss thus extracted show that partons suffer more energy loss than in central than in peripheral collisions. However,\nonly a part of the energy loss is of dynamical origin. A major part of the centrality dependence of energy loss is\ngeometric, i.e. due to increased path length in central than in peripheral collisions. Extracted energy loss in peripheral\nSTAR and PHENIX collisions are consistent with the energy loss calculated in a Glauber model. However, Glauber\nmodel predict 1.5-2.0 times less energy loss in central collisions than the extracted values. The excess energy loss is\nof dynamical origin. If the energy loss is proportional to the density, then present analysis indicate that in central\ncollisions, density of the medium is 1.5-2.0 times higher than that of normal nuclear matter. Our analysis thus\nprecludes any high density matter formation. We have also investigated the in medium path length dependence of\nthe extracted energy loss. Energy loss in STAR and also PHENIX in central collisions show a quadratic dependence\non the medium path length, characteristic of gluon radiation in a static medium. It appears that partons lose their\nenergy before the hydrodynamic expansion sets in.\nTo Conclude, our analysis of STAR and PHENIX data on high pT suppression indicate that in central collisions,\npartons lose energy due to gluon radiation, in a static medium, of density, 1.5-2.0 times normal nuclear density.\n\n\u2217\ne-mail:akc@veccal.ernet.in\n[1] J.
