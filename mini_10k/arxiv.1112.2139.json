These\ntopological configurations form domains of local strong parity violation (P-odd domains) in\nthe hot QCD matter through the so-called sphaleron transitions. The domains might be\ndetected using the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME)[1] where the strong external (electrodynamic) magnetic field at the early stage of a (non-central) collision, through the sphaleron\ntransitions induces a charge separation along the direction of the magnetic field which is\nperpendicular to the reaction plane. Such an out of plane charge separation, however, varies\nits orientation from event to event, either parallel or anti-parallel to the magnetic field\n(sphaleron or antisphaleron). Also the magnetic field can be up or down with respect to\nthe reaction plane depending if the ions pass in a clockwise or anti-clockwise manner. Any\nP-odd observable will vanish and only the variance of such observable may be detected.\nThe STAR collaboration[2] has published a measurement of charge particle azimuthal\ncorrelations consistent with CME expectations. In Ref.[3] and used by STAR the CME can\nbe indirectly approached through a two-particle azimuthal correlation given by\n\u03b3 = hcos(\u03c61 + \u03c62 \u2212 2\u03a8RP )i = hcos(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03a8RP )cos(\u03c62 \u2212 \u03a8RP )i \u2212 hsin(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03a8RP )sin(\u03c62 \u2212 \u03a8RP )i,\n(1)\nwhere \u03a8RP , \u03c61 , \u03c62 denote the azimuthal angles of the reaction plane, produced particle 1,\nand produced particle 2. This two particle azimuthal correlation measures the difference\nbetween the in plane and out of plane projected azimuthal correlation. If we would rotate\nall events such that \u03a8RP = 0.0, then \u03b3 would become\n\u03b3 = hcos(\u03c61 + \u03c62 )i = hcos(\u03c61)cos(\u03c62 )i \u2212 hsin(\u03c61 )sin(\u03c62 )i.\n\n(2)\n\n\fThe CME predicts that \u03b3 > 0 for opposite sign-pairs and \u03b3 < 0 for same sign-pairs. There\nare other two particle azimuthal correlation effects that can depend on the reaction plane\ndriven by elliptic flow even though the underlying correlation may be independent of the\nreaction plane. These backgrounds are summarized in Ref.[4]. It was pointed in Ref.[4] that\nthe \u03c6 difference correlation (\u03b4) which is independent of the reaction plane gives a constraint\non the CME and backgrounds.\n\u03b4 = hcos(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 )i = hcos(\u03c61 )cos(\u03c62)i + hsin(\u03c61 )sin(\u03c62 )i.\n\n(3)\n\nIn Ref.[4] Transverse Momentum Conservation (TMC) is derived and demonstrated that\nif there is no other correlation in the data except elliptic flow TMC will give a negative\nhcos(\u03c61 + \u03c62 \u2212 2\u03a8RP )i (\u03b3) which is v2 smaller than hcos(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 )i (\u03b4). \u03b4 is a negative\nnumber given by TMC and scales as 1/N (N is the number of particles). Depending on\nother correlations the connection between \u03b3 and \u03b4 could be larger than v2 . Also in Ref.[4]\nLocal Charge Conservation (LCC) is another important background and the details of LCC\nis found in Ref.[5]. The authors of Ref.[5] point out that for same sign pairs LCC should\ngive a small negative sign, while for opposite sign pairs LCC should give a large positive\ncorrelation. Using the same coupling effect to the reaction plane as TMC, one should expect\nhcos(\u03c61 + \u03c62 \u2212 2\u03a8RP )+\u2212 i (\u03b3) equal v2 times hcos(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 )+\u2212 i (\u03b4) for the LCC.\nRef.[1] has pointed out that P-odd domains on the surface of the fireball omit same charge\nsign particles in the direction of the magnetic field. The particles that escape the surface\nwould be of the same sign while the charge particles moving in the opposite direction would\nbe of opposite sign. These particles would run into the fireball and be thermalized and loss\ntheir direction (quenched). This effect makes it hard to know what the CME should give\nfor opposite sign pairs. Also when one considers opposite sign pairs the LCC effect is much\nstronger than the TMC effect making \u03b4 a large positive number. When we scale down by\nthe expected v2 to obtain \u03b3 we obtain a larger positive number which is bigger than what is\nmeasured. \u03b4 (2.0) times v2 (.06) equals \u03b3 (.12) where the measured value of \u03b3 is .06. We need\nsome additional negative .06 from some other source. Minijet quenching can increase the\nhsin(\u03c61 )sin(\u03c62 )i term because there is more quenching out of plane than in plane. This could\naccount for a reduction of .06. I think it is clear that having three important effects plus\ntwo quenching effects makes the opposite sign very hard to make an analysis. On the other\nhand LCC, minijets and CME quenching for the same sign can be considered unimportant.\nThe paper is organized in the following manner:\nSec. 1 is the introduction to correlations. Sec. 2 is an analysis of the same sign data.\nSec. 3 LHC analysis and predictions. Sec. 4 presents the summary and discussion.\n\n2\n\nSame Sign Analysis\n\nIn performing the same charge sign analysis we will assume that only TMC and CME\n\u221a\namplitudes are present in the Au-Au sN N =200 GeV data. We will use hcos(\u03c61 +\u03c62 \u22122\u03a8RP )i\n(\u03b3) and hcos(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 )i (\u03b4) of Ref.[2] in our analysis. Figure 1 is the \u03b3 measurement of\n\n\fSTAR while Figure 2 is the \u03b4 measurement. We can separate the Transverse Momentum\nConservation (TMC) effect in the Au-Au collisions using a STAR event shape analysis. For\n20-40% centrality half of the tracks of the TPC are used in order to determine the reaction\nplane. The other tracks are used to calculate hcos(\u03c61 +\u03c62 \u22122\u03a8RP )i (\u03b3) for same and opposite\nsign. Also hcos2(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03a8RP )i (v2 ) is calculated for these tracks. The v2 measures the shape\nof each subevent. For positive v2 we have more tracks in plane, while for negative v2 we\nwill have more tracks out of plane. The value for TMC in the correlator \u03b3 should be zero\nwhen v2 is zero. The value should be negative when v2 is positive and positive when v2 is\nnegative. On the other hand the CME should not depend on the event shape (v2 ) but only\non the collision geometry which is given by the centrality. Thus the magnetic field and the\ncharge separation is a constant offset.\nIn Figure 3 the results are plotted from the STAR analysis which used correlators that\nare proportional to -\u03b3. Ref.[4] used measurements from Ref.[2] for centrality range 50%\nto 60% because this should give the best measurement signal to errors. The value for\nhcos(\u03c61 + \u03c62 \u2212 2\u03a8RP )i (\u03b3) is -.00045 \u00b1 .00005 and hcos(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 )i (\u03b4) is -.00038 \u00b1 .00010. v2\nis 0.06 and from Figure 3 assuming that the data for the same charge sign will be proportional\nto the centrality range 50% to 60%, we can determine the ratio of pure CME to \u03b3 at measured\nhcos2(\u03c6\u2212 \u03a8RP )i = 0.0 and hcos2(\u03c6\u2212 \u03a8RP )i = .06. Figure 3 gives a ratio of 0.60 \u00b1 0.15.\n\n2.1\n\nFit Model\n\nThe fit model that we will use assumes that the three experimental values \u03b3, \u03b4 and the ratio\nfor the centrality range 50% to 60% can be fitted by three equations.\n\u03b3 = hcos(\u03c61 + \u03c62 )i = CME + ScaleT \u2217 TMC.\n\n(4)\n\n\u03b4 = hcos(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 )i = TMC \u2212 ScaleM \u2217 CME.\n(5)\nCME\nCME\nratio =\n=\n.\n(6)\n\u03b3\nCME + ScaleT \u2217 TMC\nWhere ScaleT is the faction of the TMC which is measure as part of \u03b4 as translated to \u03b3 and\nScaleM is the faction of the CME which is measure as part of \u03b3 as translated to \u03b4. From the\nabove equations we have three equations and four unknowns.\n\n2.2\n\nIn Plane and Out of Plane\n\nEquation 2 and equation 3 show how \u03b3 and \u03b4 can be broken up into an in plane term\nhcos(\u03c61 )cos(\u03c62 )i and an out of plane term hsin(\u03c61 )sin(\u03c62 )i. If we would make a simple\nassumption that the in plane hcos(\u03c61 )cos(\u03c62 )i is equal to the TMC value and that the out\nof plane hsin(\u03c61 )sin(\u03c62 )i is equal to the CME value, one can fit the equation 4 and equation\n5 with ScaleT and ScaleM equal 1.0. TMC is equal to -.00041 and the CME is equal to\n-.00004, but the ratio is only .09 which is way off. Let us consider the behavior of the CME\nterm. Let us look at the pure CME case. Equation 4 becomes\nhcos(\u03c61 )cos(\u03c62 )i \u2212 hsin(\u03c61 )sin(\u03c62 )i = CME,\n\n(7)\n\n\f\u221a\nFigure 1: (Color) (Solid points) hcos(\u03c61 + \u03c62 \u2212 2\u03a8RP )i (\u03b3) calculated for Au-Au sN N =200\nGeV events data acceptance cuts of 0.15 < pt < 2 GeV/c and |\u03b7| < 1.0.

This is true in general.\n\n2.3\n\nFinal Fit\n\nWe have seen in the last subsection that in general ScaleM = 1.0 thus equation 4 through 6\nbecomes\n\u03b3 = hcos(\u03c61 + \u03c62 )i = CME + ScaleT \u2217 TMC.\n(12)\n\u03b4 = hcos(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 )i = TMC \u2212 CME.\nratio =\n\nCME\nCME\n=\n.\n\u03b3\nCME + ScaleT \u2217 TMC\n\n(13)\n(14)\n\nWe now have three equations and three unknowns.

However there must\nbe some other correlation of same sign charge pairs which makes the effect four times bigger.\nRef.[6] showed that there is a suppression of near side same sign charge pairs created by the\nstrong chromo-electric fields inside the glasma flux tubes generated by the color glass initial\nstate of the Au-Au collisions. This suppression greatly increases the negative TMC effect\nbetween back to back particles of the same charge sign.\n\n\f3\n\nLHC Analysis and Predictions\n\nAt the LHC the ALICE experiment has made measurements like STAR but on Pb-Pb at\n\u221a\nsN N =2.76 TeV. We will again performing a same charge sign analysis using hcos(\u03c61 + \u03c62 \u2212\n2\u03a8RP )i (\u03b3) and hcos(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 )i (\u03b4). Figure 4 is the \u03b3 measurement of ALICE while Figure 5\nis the \u03b4 measurement. Since LHC is at such a higher energy hard scattering or jets play a\nlarger role. Let us initially assume that only jets and CME are present in the data.\nAgain the fit model will use the centrality range 50% to 60% for the LHC. The value for\nhcos(\u03c61 + \u03c62 \u2212 2\u03a8RP )i (\u03b3) is -.0004 and hcos(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 )i (\u03b4) is .00125. The v2 value for this\ndata is .105. We break up the \u03b3 and \u03b4 into an in plane term hcos(\u03c61)cos(\u03c62 )i and an out of\nplane term hsin(\u03c61 )sin(\u03c62 )i.\nhcos(\u03c61 )cos(\u03c62)i = .000425,\n\n(15)\n\nhsin(\u03c61 )sin(\u03c62 )i = .000825.\n\n(16)\n\nand\n\n3.1\n\nJets and CME\n\nUsing Ref.[4] as applied to jets, we can write\n\u03b3 = hcos(\u03c61 + \u03c62 )i = v2 Jet.\n\n(17)\n\n\u03b4 = hcos(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 )i = Jet.\n\n(18)\n\nThus solving for hcos(\u03c61 )cos(\u03c62 )i, we have\nhcos(\u03c61 )cos(\u03c62 )i = 0.5(1 + v2 )Jet = .000425,\n\n(19)\n\nhsin(\u03c61 )sin(\u03c62 )i = 0.5(1 \u2212 v2 )Jet + CME = .000825.\n\n(20)\n\nand\nThe Jet = .0007692 and CME = -.00048 which is bigger than the RHIC value of -.00026.\n\n3.2\n\nTMC at the LHC\n\nWe need to add Transverse Momentum Conservation (TMC) to the LHC Pb-Pb same charge\nsign analysis. At first let us assume that scaling is not the same as for jets and could differ\nfrom v2 . We can rewrite equations 19 and 20 as\nhcos(\u03c61 )cos(\u03c62 )i = 0.5(1 + v2 )Jet \u2212 0.5(1 + ScaleT)TMC = .000425,\n\n(21)\n\nand\nhsin(\u03c61 )sin(\u03c62 )i = 0.5(1 \u2212 v2 )Jet \u2212 0.5(1 \u2212 ScaleT)TMC + CME = .000825.\n\n(22)\n\n\fFigure 4: The centrality dependence of the integrated three-particle correlator hcos(\u03c6\u03b1 +\n\u03c6\u03b2 \u2212 2\u03a8RP )i (\u03b3) measured with four independent methods: the cumulant method using\nTPC tracks; the event plane estimation using the TPC, using the ZDC, or using the VZERO\ndetectors. The correlation between same charge pairs and opposite charge pairs are indicted\non the figure.\n\n\fFigure 5: The centrality dependence of the integrated two-particle correlator hcos(\u03c6\u03b1 \u2212 \u03c6\u03b2 )i\n(\u03b4) measured by ALICE (close symbols) and STAR (open symbols). The correlation between\nsame charge pairs and opposite charge pairs are indicted on the figure.\n\n\fThe TMC value can be written in terms of the Jet value using equation 21.\nTMC =\n\n0.5(1 + v2 )Jet \u2212 .000425\n.\n0.5(1 + ScaleT)\n\n(23)\n\nTMC is a negative correlation and in equation 21 and 22 this negative sign has been\ntaken into account making the TMC term of these equations positive. From equation 23 if\nTMC = 0.0 then Jet = .0007692. If we increase Jet then TMC will increase. How large is\nthe Jet term in the LHC data? In the next subsection we use the opposite charge sign pairs\nin order to estimate the value of Jet and TMC.\n\n3.3\n\nOpposite Sign Data and the TMC\n\nWe can use the opposite charge sign data for centrality range 50% to 60% from Figure 4 and\nFigure 5. The value for hcos(\u03c61 + \u03c62 )i (\u03b3) is 0.0 and hcos(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 )i (\u03b4) is .0033. We break up\nthe \u03b3 and \u03b4 into an in plane term hcos(\u03c61 )cos(\u03c62 )i and an out of plane term hsin(\u03c61 )sin(\u03c62 )i\nand obtain\nhcos(\u03c61 )cos(\u03c62)i = (1 + v2 )Jet \u2212 0.5(1 + v2 )TMC = .00165.\n(24)\n\nNote that for ScaleT we have used v2 because for the opposite sign pairs there is no local\nsuppression of near side pairs which increases the negative TMC effect between back to back\nparticles. Also the 0.5 factor in front of the Jet term is gone. This doubling of the Jet term\ncome from the fact that in p-p the opposite sign correlation for jets is twice the same sign\ncorrelation.\n\n3.4\n\nLHC Predictions\n\nIn the last two subsections we have determined two equations and two unknowns, namely\nthe Jet term and the TMC term in equation 23 and equation 24. First let us consider the\ncase where v2 is .105 and ScaleT = v2 . From these two equations one gets Jet = .002217\nand TMC = .001448. When we substitute these values into equation 22 the CME value is\n-.00048. This value is the same as determined in the the first LHC subsection where there\nwas no TMC term.\nWhat would an analysis of event shape give at the LHC? Like in the STAR event shape\nanalysis we use half of the tracks of the TPC in order to determine the reaction plane.\nThe other tracks are used to calculate hcos(\u03c61 + \u03c62 \u2212 2\u03a8RP )i (\u03b3) for same sign. Also\nhcos2(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03a8RP )i (v2 ) is also calculated for these same tracks. The v2 measures the shape of\neach subevent. For positive v2 we have more tracks in plane, while for negative v2 we will\nhave more tracks out of plane. The value for Jet plus TMC in the correlator -\u03b3 should be\nzero when v2 is zero. The value of Jet plus TMC should be positive when v2 is positive and\nnegative when v2 is negative. We have plotted Figure 3 again adding a solid line which is\nproportional to -\u03b3 that would be measured at ALICE if ScaleT is equal to v2 (Figure 6).\nThe slope of the solid line is negative instead of positive like it is at RHIC. The difference in\nsign comes from the positive value of hcos(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 )i (\u03b4) at LHC while at RHIC it is negative.\n\n\fThe effect of the TMC term in the \u03b3 correlator was determined at RHIC and was four\ntimes larger than v2 . The same suppression of near side same sign charge pairs which is\ncreated by the strong chromo-electric fields inside the glasma flux tubes generated by the\ncolor glass initial state of the Pb-Pb collisions maybe at work. This suppression could greatly\nincreases the negative TMC effect between back to back particles of the same charge sign.\nWe do not know how strong this effect is at the LHC, but if we use the same value of ScaleT\nmeasured at RHIC ScaleT = .2836, then Jet = .002040 and TMC = .001094. When we\nsubstitute these values into equation 22 the CME value is -.000304. Again we can predict\non Figure 6 (this time a dashed line) what should be measured at ALICE if ScaleT is equal\nto .2836. The slope of the dashed line has the same value as the solid line except it has the\nopposite sign. This slope is not as extreme as at RHIC. The slope is flatter than at RHIC\nbecause of a cancellation by the Jet term scaled down by v2 (.105) with the TMC term scaled\nby ScaleT (.2836). At RHIC there is no Jet term.\n\n4\n\nSummary and Discussion\n\nWe have shown in this manuscript that The Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is consistent\nwith the correlation analysis for same sign charge pairs done by the STAR experiment on\n\u221a\nmid-peripheral Au-Au Collisions sN N =200 GeV. There are backgrounds present which can\ngive signals that make the CME measurement hard to interpret. The STAR experiment has\nmade a measurement that makes it possible to separate out the background from the signal\nfor the same sign charge pairs. For the same sign charge pairs the Transverse Momentum\nConservation (TMC) term is the only major background and it will very with the shape of\nparticle production characterized by hcos2(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03a8RP )i (v2 ). The v2 measures the shape of\neach event. For positive v2 we have more tracks in plane, while for negative v2 we will have\nmore tracks out of plane. The value for TMC in the correlator hcos(\u03c61 + \u03c62 \u2212 2\u03a8RP )i (\u03b3)\nshould be zero when v2 is zero. The value should be negative when v2 is positive and positive\nwhen v2 is negative. Thus through this event shape analysis one can measure the CME.\nWe have made a fit to same charge pairs correlations at a centrality value of 50-60% using\n\u221a\nequations 12-14. We have determined that at this centrality for Au-Au Collisions sN N =200\nGeV the value of CME is -.0002625 +.0000638 -.0000845. The TMC is two and half times\nbigger and of the same sign. The CME is a flow of charge out of the reaction driven by\nthe magnetic field. This flow causes a charge separation and should be measurable. We can\ndefine in an event by event manner an in plane and out of plane charge separation\nR\n\u2206QIN = (NL+ \u2212 NL\u2212 ) \u2212 (NR\n+ \u2212 N\u2212 )\n\n(25)\n\nT\nB\nB\n\u2206QOUT = (NT\n+ \u2212 N\u2212 ) \u2212 (N+ \u2212 N\u2212 ).\n\n(26)\n\nand\nIf there is a flow of charge out of plane then \u2206QOUT should be wider than the in plane \u2206QIN .\nFor centrality 40-50% we show the \u2206Q distributions (see Figure 7). In this Figure we also\nshow that the rms difference between out of plane and in plane divided by the average rms\nof the two distributions. The fact that this difference is positive and not consistent with any\n\n\fFigure 6: The STAR charge correlation difference hA2UD i \u2212 hA2LR i and hA+ A\u2212 iUD \u2212 A+ A\u2212 iLR\nwhich is proportional to \u2212\u03b3 for the same sign pairs (squares) and opposite sign pairs (dots)\nunder the selection of soft particles low-pt (pt < 2 GeV/c) is ploted as a function of azimuthal\nanisotropy shape of the sub-events. The solid line is a prediction of what would be measured\nat the LHC if the ScaleT is equal to v2 (.105). The dash is a prediction of what would be\nmeasured at the LHC if the ScaleT is equal to what it was at RHIC (.2836).\n\n\f\u221a\nFigure 7: Top panel: sample \u2206Q distributions for 40-50% Au-Au sN N = 200 GeV collisions\nin plane and out of plane. Bottom panel: is the rms difference between out of plane and in\nplane divided by the averge rms of the two distributions.\nknown background other than CME, we conclude that the CME is the best and simplest\nexplanation of the data.\n\u221a\nWith the success of the RHIC Au-Au sN N =200 GeV CME measurement we considered\n\u221a\nthe LHC Pb-Pb sN N =2.76 TeV measurements. First we find that hcos(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 )i (\u03b4) as\nmeasured by ALICE for the same charge sign pairs has changed sign. We assume that this\nis because of the importance of hard scattering or jets playing a greater role. By adding a\njet term we are able to determine the amount of CME for the same 50-60% centrality. The\nvalue of CME is a little less than twice the value measured at RHIC -.00048 to -.00030. We\ncan also make a prediction for the shape dependence of the event shape analysis if it is done\nat ALICE using their TPC (see Figure 6). This event shape analysis is a very important test\nof our approach to the same charge sign correlation data. However if the TMC effects scales\nlike it did at RHIC the sign of the event shape correlation slope sign will be the same as at\n\n\fRHIC but of a smaller value. If this prediction is false then our analysis is false. One should\nnote the lower range of the CME value falls with in the range of the RHIC result. One must\nalso make the \u2206Q measurements. The width of \u2206QOUT must continue to be larger than\n\u2206QIN .\n\n5\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis research was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DEAC02-98CH10886.\n\nReferences\n[1] D.E.
