The high velocity UV component is of\nlower density, log N = 18.6, and likely resides farther from the central engine as\nwe find its ionization parameter to be U = 0.08.\nSubject headings: galaxies: active - galaxies: individual (NGC 7469) - galaxies:\nSeyfert - quasars: absorption lines - ultraviolet: galaxies - X-ray: galaxies\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAbsorption edges are visible in the X-ray spectra of about one half of all low redshift\nAGN (Reynolds 1997; George et al. 1998; Crenshaw, Kraemer, & George 2003). Ensemble\nstudies of the warm absorber population in Seyfert galaxies (Blustin et al. 2005) indicate,\nfrom estimates of the radial positions of the absorbers, that these systems are likely predominately outflows from the dusty torus surrounding the accretion disk in each object, while\nthose seen in PG quasars are more likely to arise in an accretion disk wind. All of these objects also show high-ionization absorption lines in their UV spectra (Crenshaw et al. 1999).\nThis suggests a connection between the two phenomena, if not a complete identification of\none with the other. The position of the absorbing complexes in velocity space, generally\nblueshifted with respect to the systemic redshift of the parent AGNs, the variability of the\nabsorption (Kriss et al. 1995; Shields & Hamann 1997; Crenshaw & Kraemer 1999; Crenshaw et al. 2000; Kraemer et al. 2001, 2002; Gabel et al. 2003a) and the non-unity continuum\nand/or broad emission line region (BELR) covering fractions determined for many UV absorbers (Kriss et al. 2000b; Gabel et al. 2003b; Kraemer, Crenshaw, & Gabel 2001; Kraemer\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\net al. 2001; Kraemer et al. 2003; Brotherton et al. 2002; Crenshaw et al. 2003) point to an\norigin for the gas that is intrinsic to the AGN. AGN outflows are a potentially significant\nsource of feedback energy (Granato et al. 2004; Scannapieco & Oh 2004), influencing the\nluminosity-temperature relation for the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters by steepening\nit on the scale of galaxy groups (Cavaliere et al. 2002), as well as providing metals to and\ngoverning the formation of galaxies and later generations of AGNs from the intergalactic\nmedium (Adelberger et al. 2003).\nIntrinsic absorption in many AGNs has been studied using high spectral resolution UV\nand X-ray observations: Mrk 279 (Scott et al. 2004; Gabel et al. 2005); Mrk 509 (Kriss\net al. 2000b; Kraemer et al. 2003; Yaqoob et al. 2003); NGC 3516 (Kraemer et al. 2002);\nNGC 3783 (Kraemer, Crenshaw, & Gabel 2001; Kaspi et al. 2001; Blustin et al. 2002; Gabel\net al. 2003a,b); NGC 4051 (Collinge et al. 2001; Ogle et al. 2004); NGC 4151 (Crenshaw\net al. 2000; Kraemer et al. 2001); NGC 5548 (Mathur et al. 1999; Crenshaw & Kraemer\n1999; Brotherton et al. 2002; Kaastra et al. 2000, 2002; Crenshaw et al. 2003; Steenbrugge\net al. 2003). However, with the exception of Mrk 279 and some data taken for the longterm campaign on NGC 3783, these observations have been performed at different times\nin the UV and X-rays. The high degree of variability in AGN continua complicates selfconsistent photoionization modeling of the intrinsic absorption from these non-simultaneous\ndata, preventing firm conclusions about the nature of the relationship between UV and X-ray\nabsorbers.\nThe Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 7469 (z = 0.01639, de Vaucouleurs et al. 1991) has been\nstudied extensively in the optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray regimes (Wanders et al. 1997; Collier\net al. 1998), and has been the subject of simultaneous UV and X-ray variability studies\n(Kriss et al. 2000a; Nandra et al. 1998, 2000). The intrinsic absorption in NGC 7469 has\nbeen studied previously in the X-ray with XMM-Newton (Blustin et al. 2003) and in the\nUV with FUSE (Kriss et al. 2003). However those observations were separated by one year,\nmaking the campaign presented here the first set of simultaneous, high-resolution UV and\nX-ray spectral observations. These authors found two primary components in the UV, with\noutflow velocities of \u2212569 and \u22121898 km s\u22121 . The low velocity component is identified with\nthe high-ionization phase of the X-ray absorption, also responsible for the X-ray emission.\nIts partial covering fraction suggests its position coincides with that of the BELR. The high\nvelocity UV component has no associated X-ray absorber. Likewise, the low-ionization phase\nof the X-ray absorption appears to have no UV counterpart.\nHere, we present the simultaneous UV and X-ray observations and describe the properties of the AGN outflow. We present photoionization models of the absorbing gas and draw\nconclusions about its geometry.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n2.\n\nX-ray: Chandra\n2.1.\n\nData\n\nWe observed NGC 7469 on 2002 December 12-13 for 150 ksec with the High Energy\nTransmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) on the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. The\nHETGS 1 provides resolving power up to \u223c1000 from 0.5 keV to 8.0 keV through the use\nof two gratings: (1) the Medium Energy Grating (MEG) which gives good spectral coverage\nfrom 0.5 keV to 5.0 keV (2.5-25 \u00c5); and (2) the High Energy Grating (HEG), which is\noptimized for the 0.8-8.0 keV (1.6-15 \u00c5) spectral region.\nWe extracted the spectra using the standard CIAO v3.0.1 pipeline. In order to maximize\nsignal-to-noise, we co-added the \u00b11 order MEG and HEG spectra and binned to 0.02 \u00c5 for\nanalysis. Coarser 0.06 \u00c5 bins were used to determine the continuum model. We used\nISIS v.1.2.12 (Houck & Denicola 2000) for spectral analysis. See Table 1 for a summary of\nthe Chandra observation details.\n\n2.2.\n\nAnalysis: Continuum Fit and Spectral Features\n\nWe fit the coarsely-binned MEG and HEG spectra in the 0.5-8.5 keV range with a powerlaw plus blackbody continuum modified by absorption from a Galactic hydrogen column of\n4.8 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 (Dickey & Lockman 1990). We used the xspec models tbabs (Wilms, Allen,\n& Mc Cray 2000) and diskbb (see, eg. Mitsuda et al. 1984; Makishima et al. 1986), respectively\nto model the absorption and black-body components. The photon index of the power-law\nspectrum is \u0393 = 1.7910 \u00b1 0.0009, with a normalization of A = (6.97 \u00b1 0.10) \u00d7 10\u22123 photons\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 keV\u22121 at 1 keV in the emitted frame, and the temperature of the blackbody is\n120\u00b15 eV, with overall \u03c72 /dof = 1.12. As Blustin et al. (2003), we note that this continuum\nmodel is simply a convenient parametrization that allows us to fit the emission and absorption\nfeatures in the Chandra spectrum, it is not meant to be a physical model of the continuum.\nThe errors quoted are 90% confidence limits. The HETG spectrum, the continuum fit, and\nits components, including a Gaussian fit to the Fe K\u03b1 line, are shown in Figure 1. We also\nincluded additional multiplicative model components to account for calibration effects. We\nuse: (1) an ad hoc correction for ACIS pileup effects which also reduces the effect of the\niridium M-edge (Marshall et al. 2004a); (2) a correction to bring the frontside-illuminated\n1\n\nFor further details on Chandra instruments, see http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer/POG.\n\n2\n\nhttp://space.mit.edu/ASC/ISIS/\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nchip QEs into agreement with the backside-illuminated chip quantum efficiencies (Marshall\net al. 2004a); and (3) an ACIS contamination correction (Marshall et al. 2004b).\nIn regions of overlap, we require a spectral feature to be identified in both the HEG\nand MEG spectra in order to qualify as a bona fide absorption or emission line. Because the\nresolution of the HEG spectrum is 2\u00d7 that of the MEG spectrum, we use the HEG spectrum\nalone to measure the centroid equivalent width(flux) and FWHM of an absorption(emission)\nline in the 1.6-12.6 \u00c5 region. At longer wavelengths, the S/N in the HEG spectrum falls\nbelow \u223c3 and we use the MEG spectrum. We also require reasonable oscillator strengths\nfor quoted absorption features. For example, if we detect a Ly\u03b2 feature from a particular\nspecies, we require its Ly\u03b1 transition to be detected as well. The HEG and MEG spectra\nare shown in detail, with the absorption and emission lines we identify and describe below,\nin Figures 2-4. The continuum fit shown in these figures is the global fit discussed above.\nBecause of q\nthe low count rate in the ACIS pixels, we derive the flux errors per pixel from\n\u03c3N \u2248 1 + N + 43 where N is the count rate (Gehrels 1986), in order to approximate\nGaussian statistics. For comparison we also show the XMM/RGS spectrum from Blustin et\nal. (2003), in the regions of overlap with the Chandra/HETG data, 6 \u2212 25 \u00c5, in Figures 3\nand 4.\nWe find several absorption features in the Chandra/HETG spectra, and we fit Gaussians\nto the unresolved profiles to derive the equivalent widths, the line centroids, and the velocity\nwidths. We find Ly\u03b1 lines of the hydrogen-like ions Ne X and Mg XII, and a marginal\nSi XIV feature (Figure 5) and the He\u03b1 lines of Ne IX, Mg XI, and Si XIII (Figure 6). We\nalso detect Ne IX He\u03b2 with an outflow velocity and line width consistent with the He\u03b1 line.\nOf these features, Blustin et al. (2003) find only Ne IX He\u03b2 in their XMM/RGS spectrum of\nNGC 7469. However we note that the resolution of the RGS is lower than that of both the\nHEG and the MEG, by factors of \u223c2.5 and \u223c5 respectively. Also, the Si XIV line lies at the\nhigh energy edge of the RGS spectral range. We also find three iron features, Fe XVII \u03bb15.0,\nFe XXI \u03bb12.3, and Fe XX \u03bb12.8. No Fe XVII absorption is not found in the XMM/RGS\ndata, but there is an ambiguous feature at the position of Fe XXI. The Fe XX feature falls\non a gap in the data. Conversely, Blustin et al. (2003) report several absorption features\nthat we do not find, or find only marginal evidence for, in the Chandra spectra: O VIII Ly\u03b1\nand Ly \u03b2 which we discuss further below, O VII 3-1 (r) (18.6 \u00c5), and Ne VII Be\u03b1 (13.8 \u00c5).\nThe other lines reported by these authors lie in regions where the HETGS effective area is\nlow, or outside its spectral range altogether.\nThe parameters of the absorption line fits are summarized in Table 2, as well as those for\nthe emission features discussed below. Along with the equivalent widths, line centroids, and\nline widths, we tabulate the statistical significance of each feature defined by the detection\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nthreshold. This is defined as the equivalent width divided by the the 1\u03c3 equivalent width\nerror, calculated as a function of wavelength using the spectrum flux and error boxcarsmoothed over \u223c 2.5\u00d7 the FWHM of the line spread function (Bechtold et al. 2002). We list\nall the absorption and emission lines we detect at greater than \u223c 2.5\u03c3 in Table 2, including\nthose for which we could make no identification. The low confidence level we set leaves open\nthe possibility that some of the features in Table 2 are spurious.\nWe find a marginal narrow Ly\u03b1 emission feature redward of the Ne X absorption, shown\nin the top panel of Figure 5. The significance of both the Ne X absorption and emission lines\nin Table 2 is low, 1.3\u03c3, and they are not detected in the XMM/RGS spectrum of Blustin et\nal. (2003). However, we do detect them at 4.1\u03c3 and 3.6\u03c3 in the MEG spectrum.\nWe see some evidence of O VIII absorption blueward of, and possibly filled in by the\nLy\u03b1 emission line, as reported by Blustin et al. (2003), but we do not find O VIII Ly\u03b2 or\nLy\u03b3 absorption in the Chandra spectrum (Figure 7) as Blustin et al. (2003) did. We do not\nfind O VIII Ly\u03b2, Ly\u03b3, or Ly\u03b4 emission corresponding to the prominent Ly\u03b1 emission line,\nbut we do find significant emission features near the expected positions of the Ly-5, Ly-6,\nand Ly-7 lines. However, because the implied velocities of these features are not entirely\nconsistent with the Ly\u03b1 line, these are marked as highly tentative identifications in Table 2\nand in Figure 7. These lines are not seen in the XMM/RGS spectrum.\nFrom the S/N in the spectrum at the expected position of O VIII Ly\u03b1 absorption, we\nplace a 3\u03c3 upper limit of \u223c30 m\u00c5 on its equivalent width, which implies N(O VIII) <\n8.8 \u00d7 1017 cm\u22122 for b \u223c 100 km s\u22121 . We find no O VII He\u03b1 absorption, leading to an\nupper limit on the equivalent width of 80 m\u00c5, or N(O VII) < 1.4 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 , also for\nb \u223c 100 km s\u22121 . This choice of Doppler parameter derives from the identification of this\nunresolved X-ray absorption with Component 1 in the UV spectra, which we model with nine\nsubcomponents with FWHM=61 km s\u22121 , as described in Section 3.2.3. If we instead assume\nb = 200 km s\u22121 , the O VIII and O VII curves of growth give N(O VIII) < 5.1 \u00d7 1016 cm\u22122\nand N(O VII) < 3.4 \u00d7 1018 cm\u22122 , while b = 500 km s\u22121 gives N(O VIII) < 2.8 \u00d7 1016 cm\u22122\nand N(O VII) < 5.8 \u00d7 1016 cm\u22122 . These dramatically lower O VII column densities do not\nchange the conclusions we draw from the photoionization models in Section 4.\nAn emission feature consistent with O VII forbidden at \u2212200 km s\u22121 is shown in the\ntop panel of Figure 8. At \u223c110 m\u00c5, it is stronger than reported by Blustin et al. (2003).\nThe corresponding intercombination line, however, is highly uncertain if it is present at all,\nas shown in the bottom panel of the figure. Blustin et al. (2003) report the forbidden to\nintercombination ratio f/i \u223c 2 for O VII in the XMM data from 2000. If that ratio held for\nthis observation, the S/N in the Chandra spectrum is such that we would only expect to find\nthe intercombination line at \u223c 2.5\u03c3 confidence. We find a significant emission feature near\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nthe expected position of the O VII radiative recombination continuum, listed in Table 2.\nThe emission feature in the top panel of Figure 8 consistent with O VII(f) at \u2212980 km s\u22121\nis not statistically significant. Finally, we identify a significant emission feature at 13.91 \u00c5\nobserved with Ne IX(f) at \u2212200 km s\u22121 , although, again, we find no corresponding resonance\nor intercombination lines.\nA strong Fe K\u03b1 emission line is present in the Chandra spectrum. BeppoSAX observations (De Rosa et al. 2002) indicated the presence of a narrow emission component in\naddition to the broad emission from an accretion disk. However, Blustin et al. (2003) found\nthat the Fe K\u03b1 emission line in their XMM spectrum was best fitted by a single narrow\nGaussian. Using the continuum defined above and fitting only the 1.5-2.5 \u00c5 region of the\nHEG spectrum, we find a single Gaussian with flux 3.9 \u00b1 0.7 \u00d7 10\u22125 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 , line\nwidth 6310 \u00b1 1580 km s\u22121 (FWHM), and rest-frame energy 6.39 \u00b1 0.01 keV to be the best fit\nto this line with \u03c72 /dof = 62.5/57. Adding a second, narrow Gaussian does not improve the\nfit. These parameters are consistent with the XMM results. The width is better constrained\nby these Chandra data, however, and its value is consistent with the UV emission lines we\nfit in the STIS spectra, particularly the intermediate velocity width lines of Ly\u03b1, C IV, and\nN V. These are discussed in the next section. We note that Nandra et al. (2000) found a significant correlation of the flux in the Fe K\u03b1 line and the 2-10 keV continuum flux, indicating\nthat at least some of the flux arises within 1 light-day of the continuum source.\n\n3.\n\nUltraviolet: FUSE and STIS\n3.1.\n\nData\n\nWe observed NGC 7469 with FUSE using the 30\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 30\u2032\u2032 low-resolution aperture. See\nTable 1 for the details of the observations. We combined the two exposures taken on 2002\nDecember 13 for a total exposure time of 6948 sec. Because of visibility constraints imposed\nby the coordinated observation, there was insufficient time to align the SiC1, SiC2, and LiF2\nchannels for the FUSE exposures. Our method for correcting for the worm feature in the\nLiF1B segment uses the shape and flux level of the target in the LiF2A channel, therefore\nwe were not able to perform the correction to derive a reliable spectrum over 1093-1182 \u00c5.\nWe used the standard FUSE calibration pipelines (CALFUSE v2.2.3, see Sahnow et al.\n2000), to extract the spectra and to perform background subtraction and wavelength and\nflux calibrations. We combined the spectra from each detector and binned the spectra to\n0.05 \u00c5 bins, improving the S/N while preserving the full spectral resolution, \u223c20 km s\u22121 .\nTo correct the wavelength scale of the FUSE spectra for zero-point offsets due to place-\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nment of the target in the 30\u2032\u2032 aperture, we applied a 0.0638 \u00c5 shift to bring the wavelength\nscale into agreement with the heliocentric spectrum observed by FUSE in 1999 described\nby Kriss et al. (2003). These authors established the zero point of the wavelength scale by\ncomparing the positions of interstellar absorption lines such as Ar I, Fe II, O I, and H2 to the\nvelocity of the Galactic 21 cm emission. We estimate that the residual systematic errors in\nthe FUSE wavelength scale are on the order of 15 km s\u22121 , and that the flux scale is accurate\nto \u223c10%.\nSimultaneously with the FUSE observations, we obtained observations of NGC 7469\nwith the STIS FUV MAMA over 5 orbits (13013 sec) through the 0.2\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 0.2\u2032\u2032 aperture using\nthe medium-resolution E140M echelle grating covering 1150-1730 \u00c5. We also obtained 9\norbits (22810 sec) of STIS data on NGC 7469 over two visits on 2004 June 21-22 using the\nsame set-up as above. See Table 1 for other details of the STIS observations. We used\nCALSTIS v2.13b to process the spectra. As described above, we measure the positions of\nlines from low-ionization species, Si II, N I, Si III, C II, C II\u2217 , Si IV, Fe II, and Al II in\nthe STIS spectrum, and compare these to the mean heliocentric velocity of the H I 21cm emission. We find that no correction to the wavelength scale derived by the CALSTIS\npipeline is necessary. Using a white dwarf spectrophotometric standard, we applied a small\ncorrection to the flux in the STIS spectra to correct for residual echelle ripple structure and\nchanges in the MAMA detector sensitivity not accounted for in the current STIS pipeline.\nGabel et al. (2005) will present a full description of this process.\nFinally, we discuss the origin of a depression in the STIS spectrum at 1418.8 \u00c5. The\nexpected position of redshifted Si IV at rest with respect to the AGN is 1416.61 \u00c5, so this\nfeature is inconsistent with Si IV absorption due to intrinsic, outflowing gas. Also, this\nfeature is shallow and broad, and qualitatively unlike other intrinsic features. We attribute\nthis feature to an instrumental effect, namely a shadow on the MAMA detector. The STIS\nFUV MAMA employs a field electrode, or repeller wire, to direct any electrons emitted in\ndirections away from the microchannel plate detectors back into the channels. The repeller\nwire shadow runs from (x, y) = (1, 994) to (1048, 1134). The feature appears in order 104,\nwhich is centered at y = 1030.7 in pixel space, and runs from y = 1038 to y = 1014,\ncovering wavelengths 1414.3 to 1429.9 \u00c5. The wire crosses the dispersion axis at an obtuse\nangle, thus the feature is broad in the extracted spectrum. Because the shadow appears in\nslightly different locations depending which optical element is present in the spectrograph,\nit is not divided out in the flat field, but simply flagged in the data quality array. A broad\ndepression in the flux in STIS/E140M spectra has been reported by others (Kraemer et al.\n2001; Leitherer et al. 2001), and a very similar feature is visible in an E140M spectrum of\nMrk 279 (Gabel et al. 2005). Therefore, we conclude that this is not a feature intrinsic to\nNGC 7469.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n3.2.\n\nAnalysis\n\n3.2.1. Continuum and Emission Lines\nWe used the IRAF3 task specfit (Kriss 1994) and spectral regions unaffected by absorption features to fit the continuum and emission lines in the FUSE and STIS spectra of\nNGC 7469. This routine is an interactive spectral fitting tool that uses \u03c72 minimization techniques to derive the best fitting parameters for a user-specified model. For the continuum,\nwe fit a power law of the form f\u03bb = f1000 \u03bb\u2212\u03b1 to the 2002 FUSE and STIS spectra simultaneously, where the normalization, f1000 , is the flux at 1000 \u00c5, and we include the Galactic\nextinction law of Cardelli, Clayton & Mathis (1989) with RV = 3.1 and E(B-V)=0.069\n(Schlegel, Finkbeiner, & Davis 1998) in the continuum fits. The best fit parameters are\n\u03b1 = 1.082 \u00b1 0.021 and f1000 = 8.18 \u00b1 0.06 \u00d7 10\u221214 ergs s\u22121 cm\u22122 \u00c5\u22121 . For the 2004 STIS\nspectrum, we fit f\u03bb = 3.25 \u00b1 0.01 \u00d7 10\u221214 \u03bb\u22121.086\u00b10.007 ergs s\u22121 cm\u22122 \u00c5\u22121 . We fit Gaussian\nprofiles to the emission lines in all the spectra, the most prominent of which are broad and\nnarrow components of O VI in the FUSE band, and Ly\u03b1 and C IV in the STIS band. The\nLy\u03b1 profile requires four Gaussian components for a reasonable fit- broad, intermediate and\ntwo narrow components. The C IV emission line requires one broad, one intermediate, and\none narrow component for a good fit, and we fit intermediate width and narrow components\nto the N V emission. These emission lines are plotted in Figures 9 and 10, and the fit\nparameters are tabulated in Table 3.\n\n3.2.2. Interstellar and Intergalactic Absorption Features\nThere are 4 velocity components of 21-cm emission along the NGC 7469 sightline, including one high velocity component associated with the Magellanic Stream at \u2212333 km s\u22121 (Wakker\net al. 2001). The strongest component of the interstellar absorption, with strong molecular\nhydrogen absorption (Wakker et al. 2003), lies at zero velocity. We divide the ISM absorption from the FUSE spectrum using a two-temperature model of the zero velocity absorption\nconstructed from the FUSE spectral simulation code FSIM. Because the STIS spectra are\nmuch less crowded, we can use an empirical approach, modeling the ISM lines in the vicinity\nof intrinsic lines by fitting unblended lines of the same species and scaling by the appropriate\noscillator strength ratios from published atomic data.\n3\n\nIRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which are operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National\nScience Foundation.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nWe identify an intergalactic absorption feature at z = 0.0134 from its strong Ly\u03b1 line\nin the STIS spectra. The qualitative shape of this feature is not as broad and shallow as the\nfeature at 1419 \u00c5 caused by the repeller wire shadow discussed above, and no such feature\nis expected at this position, or flagged near this position in the data quality array.\nCuriously, this intergalactic Ly\u03b1 lies between the two components of intrinsic absorption\nwe discuss below. We consider this system intergalactic for the following reasons: (1) We\nfind no O VI, N V, or C IV absorption corresponding to this system; and (2) The absorption\ndoes not vary between the 2002 and 2004 observations as the UV flux decreases by a factor\nof 2.5. This could because its absorption is highly saturated, but we rule out this possibility,\neven for a small covering fraction because no corresponding Ly\u03b2 absorption is seen in the\nFUSE spectrum. Fixing the covering fraction to unity, we use specfit to derive N(H I) =\n6.7 \u00b1 0.3 \u00d7 1012 cm\u22122 and b = 52 \u00b1 2 km s\u22121 for this intervening absorber.\n\n3.2.3. Intrinsic Absorption Features\nKriss et al. (2003) reported two primary components of UV absorption, labeled Components 1 and 2, each with several velocity subcomponents. We use the IRAF task specfit\nto fit the absorption profiles as Gaussians in optical depth, specified by four parameters: (1)\nthe optical depth at line center, (2) the line centroid, (3) the line width, and (4) the covering\nfraction. For doublets and members of a line series, we fix the central optical depths to\nthe ratios required by the products of the wavelengths and the oscillator strengths. From\nthese fits, we derive column densities and covering fractions for all subcomponents of the\nabsorption complexes, Components 1 and 2. The errors on these parameters are determined\nby specfit by evaluating and inverting the curvature matrix around the final value of \u03c72 . For\nthe fits to the absorption profiles, we fix the continuum and emission line fits to those derived\nfrom unabsorbed regions, as described above.\nAnalysis of high S/N spectra by Arav et al. (2002), Gabel et al. (2003, 2005), and Scott\net al. (2004) shows that the profiles of intrinsic absorption lines in AGN are best described\nusing a velocity-dependent covering fraction. The FUSE and STIS data for NGC 7469,\nhowever, are too noisy for a reliable application of this technique. In addition, because we\nlack the full Lyman series from the FUSE data and because the C IV and N V doublets\nare weak in Component 1, as we discuss further below, we do not attempt such a detailed\nanalysis of these data. The next-best approach, as used by Kriss et al. (2003), decomposes\nthe line profile with multiple blended Gaussians. Properly fixed ratios of optical depth in line\ndoublets enables us to constrain the covering fraction in the individual components. Kriss\net al. (2003) found that the quality of the FUSE data were such that a single value of the\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\ncovering fraction adequately described each subcomponent. For consistency, and because\nour data have even lower S/N, we adopt the same approach here.\nIn Component 2, we fit four subcomponents as did Kriss et al. (2003). However, in\nComponent 1, we find blue and red wings of absorption in Ly\u03b1, leading to a fit consisting of\nnine subcomponents. We found that our fits did not require any change in the covering fraction of the absorption in either component in either the 2002 or the 2004 epoch observations.\nWe therefore fix the covering fractions to the 1999 values, 0.53 for Component 1 and 0.93 for\nComponent 2. We fix the width of all subcomponents at 61 \u00b1 4 km s\u22121 and 48 \u00b1 5 km s\u22121\n(FWHM) for Components 1 and 2, respectively. The resulting outflow velocities and column\ndensities in all the absorption subcomponents are listed in Table 4. For the purposes of our\nanalysis, we use the summed column densities of all the subcomponents in Components 1\nand 2. The N(H I)-weighted outflow velocity of Component 1 is \u2212562 \u00b1 11 km s\u22121 and that\nof Component 2 is \u22121901 \u00b1 3 km s\u22121 . These are plotted in Figures 11, 12, and 13 for all the\nspecies identified in intrinsic absorption in the FUSE and STIS spectra.\nThe H I absorption is identified solely by the presence of the strong Ly\u03b1 lines in the\nSTIS spectrum, seen in the top panels of Figures 12 and 13. In the 2002 FUSE spectrum no\nsignificant Ly\u03b2 absorption is detected. For Component 1, this is consistent with the low H I\ncovering fraction of the system. The Ly\u03b2 in Component 2 lies at the position of a strong\ninterstellar C II line. See Figure 11.\nThe O VI doublet is strong in both components. As noted by Kriss et al. (2003),\nthe strengths of the doublet lines in Component 1 are equal, or nearly so as best as can\nbe determined by the signal-to-noise ratio in the 2002 spectrum, which results from an\nexposure \u223c5.5 times shorter than the 1999 spectrum. Figure 14 shows both lines of the\nO VI doublet for Components 1 and 2. It is clear from this figure that in Component 1,\nthe flux ratio in the two line profiles is consistent with one within the uncertainties. The\nsame is true, however, for Component 2 in this spectrum. We performed the initial fit the\nO VI absorption in Component 1 by fixing the velocity offsets and column density ratios of\nall the subcomponents with respect to the strongest subcomponent, 1d, to those measured\nfor the strong Ly\u03b1 absorption in the STIS spectrum. We found that allowing the velocity\noffsets of the subcomponents to vary from the fiducial Ly\u03b1 values did reduce the \u03c72 of the fit\nenough to justify the extra degrees of freedom, and the values in Table 4 reflect the improved\nfit. Though we are able to measure the O VI column density in Component 1 formally, by\nsumming all the subcomponents, we treat the measurement as a lower limit, since the higher\nS/N 1999 FUSE spectrum showed that this component is highly saturated. This limit is\nshown in Figure 17, which we discuss further below in Section 3.2.4. We note the possibility\nthat the O VI column density is different in these 2002 observations than in the 2000 epoch,\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nbecause the UV continuum level has decreased and because N(H I) increased from its 1999\nvalue. We see no evidence for damping wings in the O VI profile, so an increase in N(O VI)\nfrom 1999 would imply that the line is only further saturated and our ability to measure the\ncolumn density precisely has not improved. We do not assume saturation for Component 2,\nbecause in several velocity bins, the flux ratio between the blue and red profiles is significantly\ngreater than one, and again, because the 1999 spectrum indicates that the absorption is only\nnearly, not fully saturated.\nWe identify prominent N V and C IV doublets associated with Component 2 in the STIS\nspectra. These species, including Ly\u03b1 absorption, are all identified in the 1996 epoch data\nfrom the HST/Faint Object Spectrograph and from the International Ultraviolet Explorer\npresented by Kriss et al. (2000). However, we also identify weak but significant N V and\nC IV doublets associated with Component 1. These are shown in Figures 12 and 13. While\nthe red lines of each doublet are not obviously present in the spectrum, the blue members\nof the doubles are visible in at least some subcomponents. We established the significance\nof these doublets by comparing the \u03c72 of a fit with no N V and C IV to that of a fit which\ndid include these doublets. We fit these systems by fixing the covering fractions and line\nwidths as discussed above. We allowed the column density and line center of subcomponent\n1d to vary and fixed the velocity offsets and relative column densities of all the other other\nsubcomponents to those of the O VI subcomponents. For N V, the improvement in the \u03c72 is\ndramatic in both the 2002 and 2004 STIS spectra: \u2206\u03c72 = 152 and \u2206\u03c72 = 343, respectively,\nfor the extra 2 degrees of freedom. For C IV we find \u2206\u03c72 = 22 and \u2206\u03c72 = 201. From this\nwe conclude that these absorption features are indeed present in the data. The results of\nall these absorption profile fits are listed in Table 4 and the summed column densities are\nplotted in Figure 17.\n\n3.2.4. Variability\nUsing previous FOS and STIS data along with the data presented here, we plot the\nvariation of the 1000 \u00c5 flux and the UV spectral index in Figure 15. From the 1996 observation to 2002, the 1000 \u00c5 flux increased by 26% while the power law index became harder\nby a similar factor. Between 2000 and 2002, the 1000 \u00c5 flux decreased by a factor of \u223c1.6,\nand by another factor of 2.5 between 2002 and 2004. During this time, the spectral index\ngot marginally softer, as expected, but the change is not significant given the uncertainties.\nThe intrinsic Ly\u03b1 and C IV \u03bb1548 absorption in the 2004 STIS spectrum is shown in\ncomparison with that in the 2002 spectrum in Figure 16. We plot the total H I, O VI,\nC IV, and N V column densities in Components 1 and 2 in Figure 17. The top panel of the\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nfigure includes the upper limit on N(H I) from the nondetection of Ly\u03b2 in the 1999 FUSE\nspectrum presented in Kriss et al. (2003), as well as the measurements from Ly\u03b1 in the 2002\nand 2004 STIS spectra. Also, in the second panel, we show the N(O VI) measurements for\nComponent 2 and the lower limits from the saturated absorption in Component 1 in the\n1999 and 2002 FUSE spectra.\nFrom Figures 16 and 17, we see that the absorption in Component 2 does not vary in\nmost species, with the exception of an increase in N(H I) between 1999 and the 2002/2004\nepochs. In Component 1, the H I absorption grows stronger, consistent with a change in\nthe column density of a factor of \u223c 4 from 1999 to 2002 and again by another factor of 2.3\nfrom 2002 to 2004, as the UV flux decreased by a total of a factor of 4. The lower limit on\nN(O VI) is consistent with no change since the 1999 observation. The C IV column density\nincreased by a factor of 4 between the 2002 and 2004 observations, and the N V column\ndensity also increased by a smaller factor as the UV flux decreased by a factor of 2.5. Thus,\nboth velocity components of the intrinsic absorption respond over time to changes in the\nionizing flux. In Section 5, we discuss how we use this variability to place limits on the\nradial distances of the absorbers from the AGN.\n\n4.\n\nPhotoionization Models\n\nWe computed photoionization models for the absorbing gas similar to those of Krolik\n& Kriss (1995, 2001) using the XSTAR photoionization code (Kallman et al. 2000). In\nFigure 18, we show the source spectral energy distribution used in the models. For SED1,\nwe used the UV and X-ray spectral slopes and normalizations fit to the 2002 epoch spectra\nof NGC 7469, described above in Sections 2.2 and 3.2.1. For comparison, we show SED2,\nthe SED based on the 2000 epoch FUSE and STIS observations of NGC 7469, presented\nused by Kriss et al. (2003). As described by Kriss et al. (2003), we assume f\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u22121 at\nlong wavelengths for both SED1 and SED2. This spectrum breaks at 2500 \u00c5 to f\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u22120.92\nfor SED1 and f\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u22120.75 for SED2 to match the 2000 and 2002 epoch FUSE spectra,\nrespectively. The X-ray data are matched by f\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u22120.8 for SED1 f\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u22120.7 for SED2\nbetween 0.5 keV and 100 keV.\nWe ran models in two two-dimensional grids of total absorber column density and ionization parameter, appropriate for Components 1 and 2: (log N, log U) = (19.5-20.75, \u22123.04.0) and (18.3-19.0, \u22125.3-\u22120.3), respectively, assuming solar abundances (Grevesse, Noels, &\nSauval 1996) in both cases. We then compared the column densities of the observed species:\nH I, O VI, N V, C IV in the UV data, and the H-like and He-like Ne, Mg, and Si observed\nin the Chandra data, as well as limits on O VII and O VIII to the values predicted by the\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nmodels in order to determine the properties of the two velocity components of the intrinsic\nabsorption.\nFor Component 1, we find that U = 1.0 is consistent with the measurements of N V\nand C IV, with the lower limit on the saturated O VI absorption, and with the upper limits\non the O VII and O VIII absorption from their nondetection in the Chandra data, for our\nassumption of b = 100 km s\u22121 , but also for Doppler parameters as large as \u223c 1000 km s\u22121 .\nFor the total column density, we find log N = 20.0 is a reasonable match to the absorbing\ncolumns. For Component 2, we find (log N, U) = (18.6, 0.08) gives the best match with the\nabsorption data.\nAll of the absorption from H-like and He-like ions in the Chandra data is seen at velocities\nconsistent with the outflow velocity of Component 1. However, the column densities we\nmeasure imply larger ionization parameters from the models, 8 . U . 12, implying log N >\n20, indicating the presence of multiple ionization phases, as found in the warm absorber\nassociated with NGC 3783 (Netzer et al. 2003; Krongold et al. 2003) from spectral fitting to\nphotoionization models. The relative dearth of spectral features in our Chandra spectrum\nof NGC 7469 precludes such detailed modeling in this case.\n\n5.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThese new simultaneous UV and X-ray observations of NGC 7469 allow us to compare\nthe column densities of various species observed in the absorbers with photoionization models\nin a fully self-consistent manner in order to infer the physical conditions in the outflow. From\nour multi-epoch UV observations, we use the variability of the ionizing continuum and the\nabsorption to draw conclusions about the distances of the absorbing components from the\ncentral engine of the AGN.\nKriss et al. (2003) reported U = 6.0 for Component 1. Although this value is consistent\nwith our measurement of O VI in the 2002 FUSE data, and the limits on O VII and O VIII\nfrom the Chandra spectrum, it is incompatible with the detection of any N V and C IV\nabsorption in the 2002 STIS spectrum. With the added leverage afforded by the column\ndensity measurements of these species, we now estimate U = 1.0 for this velocity component.\nThis decrease in the ionization parameter is consistent with the decrease in the ionizing\nflux between the 1999 and 2002 observations, although U = 1 is somewhat smaller than\nexpected for a constant total column density and a scaling of the number of ionizing photons,\nwhich decreases by a factor of \u223c2 for the SEDs assumed for the 1999 and 2002 epochs\nshown in Figure 18. The changes in the H I, C IV, and N V column densities between the\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nSTIS observations in 2002 and 2004 are also consistent with photoionization changes in the\nabsorber. We have no knowledge of the X-ray continuum at the 2004 epoch, but if we make\nthe simple assumption that the X-ray flux decreases in direct proportion to the UV flux, the\ncolumn densities of these species are in rough agreement with log N = 20 and U = 0.4. We\nlack the constraining power of a measurement of N(O VI) at this epoch.\nAs Steenbrugge et al. (2003) found for the warm absorber in NGC 5548 and Ogle et\nal. (2004) found for the warm absorber in NGC 4051, we find a trend of increasing column\ndensity with increasing ionization parameter for the species we detect in Component 1 of the\nNGC 7469 absorber. In Figure 19 we show the ionization parameter at which the abundance\nof each species peaks versus the equivalent hydrogen column density for that species in\nComponent 1 with a least-squares estimation of the power law fit.\nThe total hydrogen column densities derived from the Fe XX and Fe XXI lines would\nimply that the absorber is Compton thick. These columns are derived, as all the points\nin Figure 19 are, from the measured line equivalent widths using the curve of growth and\na Doppler parameter of 100 km s\u22121 . We use the fractional abundance of the ion from the\nphotoionization models and the assumed solar abundance of each atomic species. There are\ntwo ways the points could move down on Figure 19: (1) a larger Doppler parameter, eg.\nb = 500 km s\u22121 would yield NH (Fe XX) = 2 \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122 and NH (Fe XXI) = 3 \u00d7 1024 cm\u22122 ,\nhowever, we note that this would affect all the points in the figure; or (2) an enhanced iron\nabundance in the absorber, as seen in some AGN broad line regions (Hamann & Ferland\n1999) and accretion disks (Lee et al. 1999, Ballantyne & Fabian 2001, Bianchi & Matt 2002,\nSchurch et al. 2003). In any case, removing the Fe XX and Fe XXI points from the fit does\nnot change the slope or the standard deviation of the regression significantly.\nTo treat the lower limit on NH (O VI) and the upper limits on NH (O VII) and NH (O VIII)\nwe used the IRAF emmethod algorithm appropriate for censored data to perform the linear\nregression. In order to determine if the regression solution is driven primarily by the low-U\npoints in Figure 19, we performed the linear fit without the C IV, N V, and O VI points\nincluded. The standard deviation of the fit and of the individual fit parameters increases,\nbut within this increased uncertainty, the changes in the fit parameters are not significant.\nThis fit is shown by the dotted line in Figure 19. This relationship between U and NH\nillustrated in Figure 19 indicates that, while U = 1.0 for Component 1 is broadly consistent\nwith the UV data, the absorber is composed of gas with a range of ionization parameters\nand the absorbing column scales with ionization.\nThe column density and ionization parameter we infer for Component 2 are similar to\nthe values inferred by Kriss et al. (2003) for the 1996 FOS and IUE observations (Kriss et\nal. 2000a). This is consistent with a change in the ionization parameter due to a change in\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nthe ionizing flux, as the number of ionizing photons from SED1 is comparable to the number\ninferred from the Kriss et al. (2000a) SED. (See Figures 15 and 18.)\nWe find X-ray absorption in helium-like and hydrogen-like neon, magnesium, and silicon\nall at velocities consistent UV Component 1 to within 2\u03c3, although not with the same\ntotal column density and ionization parameter as the UV-absorbing species. This supports\nthe conclusions of Kriss et al. (2003) and Blustin et al. (2003), that this component is\nassociated with the X-ray warm absorber and is located closer to the central engine than\nComponent 2. This is further corroborated by the small covering fraction and outflow\nvelocity of Component 1, \u223c 0.5 and \u2212560 km s\u22121 , respectively, compared with the unity\ncovering fraction and \u223c \u22121900 km s\u22121 velocity of Component 2 with respect to the systemic\nredshift of NGC 7469. The small covering fraction of Component 1 may indicate full covering\nof the continuum source and partial covering of the BELR. This geometry is consistent with\nthe larger size of the BELR with respect to the central, continuum emission source, and has\nalso been inferred in the outflow in Mrk 279 by applying simultaneous fits to several Lyman\nseries lines and to the C IV, N V, and O VI doublets (Scott et al. 2004; Gabel et al. 2005).\nThe increase in the H I, N V, and C IV column densities in Component 1 with the decrease\nin the flux in the ionizing continuum also supports this interpretation.\nThe only X-ray absorption feature we find in common with the results of Blustin et\nal. (2003) is the Ne IX He\u03b2 line at a rest wavelength of 11.5 \u00c5 identified in Component\n1. We report its equivalent width as 14 \u00b1 5 m\u00c5, while Blustin et al. (2003) found 50 \u00b1 20\nm\u00c5. The marginal decrease in the Ne IX absorption is consistent with a photoionization\neffect and the adopted SEDs shown in Figure 18 in the sense that the flux at the ionization\npotential of Ne VIII is 23% larger in the 2000 epoch SED (SED1) relative to the 2002 SED\n(SED2). The total column density in Component 1 implied by UV absorption features from\nthe photoionization modeling discussed in Section 4, log N = 20, is consistent with that\nfound for the X-ray absorber by Blustin et al. (2003) from their XMM data. However, as\nnoted above, and as illustrated by Figure 19, the hydrogen-like and helium-like absorption we\nfind in the Chandra data imply a higher total column density indicating a range of ionization\nphases.\nWe use the fact that we see variability in the absorption in Component 1, particularly in\nits H I absorption, and the time between the 2002 and 2004 observations to place a 540-day\nupper limit on the recombination time of the gas, where trec \u2261 (ne \u03b1rec,i nni+1\n)\u22121 (Krolik &\ni\nKriss 1995). For T = 3 \u00d7 104 K, the hydrogen recombination rate is \u223c 2.3 \u00d7 10\u221213 cm3 s\u22121 .\nThis gives a fairly weak lower limit on the density, ne & 45 cm\u22123 , assuming a neutral\nfraction of 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 . Using the ionization parameter U = 1.0, this gives an upper limit on\nthe radial distance of Component 1 of \u223c100 pc. Following the prescription of Blustin et al.\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n(2005) we estimate the maximum radial distance under the assumption that the absorption\narises in a region of width less than or equal to the distance from the ionizing source:\nr \u2264 Lion Cv (r)/(\u03beNH ), where Cv (r) is the volume filling factor. For the parameters of the\nX-ray absorption derived from the 2000 epoch Chandra observation of NGC 7469 (Blustin et\nal. 2003), Blustin et al. (2005) derive Cv (r) = 0.086% and r \u2264 1.6 pc for the X-ray absorber,\nwhich we argue is the same as Component 1 of the UV absorption. Using the parameters\nderived from the UV absorption, and assuming the same volume filling factor as Blustin et\nal. (2005), we find a somewhat firmer upper limit on the distance of Component 1 from the\ncentral engine than we could place from the variability, r < 15 pc. If the UV absorption\narises in higher density material embedded in the X-ray warm absorber (Krolik & Kriss\n1995, 2001), its volume filling factor may be even smaller than that estimated above, and\nthe radial distance correspondingly smaller.\nBlustin et al. (2005) found from their comprehensive analysis of the warm absorber data\nin the literature that most absorbers in Seyfert galaxies are located at distances from the\ncentral engine consistent with the torus, indicating that the outflow may originate there in a\nscenario similar to that proposed by Krolik & Kriss (1995, 2001). In the case of NGC 7469,\nthey found that the warm absorber analyzed by Blustin et al. (2003) fits into this picture. The\nminimum and maximum distances they estimate for the absorber indicate that it lies outside\nthe radius of the BELR, 0.0042 pc (Wandel, Peterson, & Malkan 1999) and within the radius\nof the torus, \u223c L0.5\n44 pc (Krolik & Kriss 2001) where L is the ionizing luminosity between 1\nand 1000 Ryd. Allowing for the lower ionizing luminosity relevant to the 2002 observations,\na slightly larger column density weighted ionization parameter for the X-ray absorption, and\na mean outflow velocity somewhat lower than measured previously by Blustin et al. (2003),\nU \u223c 10 versus U \u223c 5, and \u2212580 km s\u22121 versus \u2212800 km s\u22121 , we find a similar overall\nresult. For both the UV and X-ray absorption in Component 1, we find rmin >> rBELR ,\n2\ngiven rmin = 2GMBH /vout\n. We note, however, that because the formal uncertainties on the\n7\nblack hole mass from Wandel et al. (1999), MBH = 0.76+0.75\n\u22120.76 \u00d7 10 M\u2299 , allow the black hole\nmass to be as low as 1.5 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 , or less, making rmin consistent with the absorber arising\nfrom an accretion disk wind. Blustin et al. (2005) propose the alternative explanation that\nthe wind has not yet achieved the escape speed and may therefore be closer to the central\nengine than rmin as estimated above. This way, the partial covering of the continuum and/or\nbroad line source demanded in particular by the saturated O VI profile of Component 1 may\nbe understood.\nThe larger outflow velocity of Component 2 compared to Component 1 leads to a smaller\nlower limit on the distance of Component 2 from the central engine, \u223c 0.02 pc. However,\ngiven the unity covering fraction of this component, it is unlikely that we can place it within\nthe BELR, even given the uncertainty in MBH noted above. We use the change in N(H I)\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nin Component 2 between the 1999 and 2002 epochs to estimate its maximum distance from\nthe ionizing source from setting the recombination time to be less than the time between\nthese observations. For a neutral fraction of 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 , trec \u2264 1100 days implies n & 20 cm\u22123 .\nThe best-fit ionization parameter for this component, U = 0.08, implies r < 600 pc.\nWe conclude that there is still ambiguity in the radial distances of the absorbers from\nthe central engine of NGC 7469, but that the general picture described in previous work\n(Blustin et al. 2003; Kriss et al. 2003) holds: Component 1 is a high density, high ionization\nabsorber located near or within the BELR and Component 2 is an absorber of relatively\nlower density and ionization located in a region that is consistent with an origin in the AGN\ntorus.\nThe authors thank K.
