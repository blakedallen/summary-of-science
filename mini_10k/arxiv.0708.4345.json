According to well established estimates, only about one percent of the gravitational\nbinding energy (or (1.4 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 1051 erg for SN 1987A; see [4]) is released in the thermal and\nkinetic energies of the expanding ejecta; the remaining part is carried away by different types\nof neutrinos [5], which are known to be trapped effectively within nuclear matter during the\nlast stages of core collapse (see [6] and references therein). Therefore, initially it did not\nseem hard to explain the observed values of kinetic energy of the expanding ejecta using\nneutrino-nucleon interaction as an effective channel of energy transfer from the emitted neutrinos to nuclear matter [7, 8]. However, concrete realization of this mechanism of supernova\nexplosions encountered with great difficulties. Thus, it was realized that the prompt shock\nwave, generated during the core collapse, fades away at the time scale of several milliseconds,\nlosing its energy on nuclear dissociation [9, 10] and on the radiation of \u03bd \u03bd\u0304-pairs [11]. As a\nresult, in simulations, the shock starts to move inward, pushed down by the infalling matter,\nleading to the formation of a black hole rather than to explosion.\nConsiderable efforts were made to remedy this situation. Bethe & Wilson [12] showed that\nthe shock wave could be revived about 100 msec after the core bounce if neutrino luminosity\nwere sufficiently enhanced. The way of such enhancement of neutrino luminosity was opened\nafter neutrino diffusion inside the center of the proto-neutron star (PNS) was discovered [13]\nand found to be convectively unstable (see [14, 15] and references therein). Nevertheless,\nnumerical simulations of the neutrino-driven shock revival still yield contradictory results.\nWhile explosions with kinetic energy up to 1.72 \u00d7 1051 erg are obtained in [16] (0.5 * 1051 erg\nin [15], 1050 erg in [17], 0.94 * 1051 erg in [18]), there is also a number of simulations where\nexplosions are not observed at all [19, 20].\nThis inconsistency between the observational data and the results of core-collapse numerical simulations motivated some researches to look for alternative mechanisms. The\nmagnetorotational mechanism, proposed by Bisnovatyi-Kogan [21], can produce explosions\nwith energies up to 0.61 \u00d7 1051 erg at the time scale of \u223c 0.5 sec after the core bounce\n[22, 23]. The acoustic mechanism, developed by Burrows et al. [24], also produces explosion;\nalthough its energy is rather uncertain in their numerical simulations, it develops for a time\n\n\f3\nrange of several hundred milliseconds. Thus, even with new mechanisms and effects taken\ninto account, the resulting energy release is marginally short of the observed values.\nOne can conclude that all mechanisms of core collapse require some additional engine to\nprovide the observable explosions. Such a new engine is the subject of the present paper.\nBy analogy with the work of Bethe et al. [13], we consider an additional type of transport\nof nuclear matter in the core which is different from diffusion and convection. It occurs in\nthe form of boiling, i.e., first order transition between different phases of nuclear matter.\nWe start with the observation that supernova matter at the inner core can exist in several\nphases and their mixtures [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. Among them are the following (in the\norder of increasing density):\n\u2022 the spherical nuclei phase\n\u2022 the phase consisting of elongated nuclei (often called pasta)\n\u2022 the slab-like nuclei\n\u2022 the phase with cylindrical holes\n\u2022 the phase with charged microscopic bubbles, or cheesed phase (we will use this last\nterm below not to confuse it with macroscopic bubbles of which we will speak later)\n\u2022 the homogeneous supernova matter\nIt is natural to expect that several phase transitions can occur during the evolution\nof nuclear matter during as well as after the core collapse. Numerical simulations of the\nnuclear-matter phase transitions in supernovae were usually aimed at determining the thermodynamic properties at the pre-bounce stage of collapse, and were needed to understand\nthe development of the prompt shock wave. Such transitions taking place in a rapidly changing environment during collapse can be called \"short-term\" phase transitions. In our paper,\nwe discuss what we call \"long-term\" phase transitions, which occur in nuclear matter after\nthe bounce under the condition of relative mechanical and local thermodynamic equilibrium.\nThe main goal of this paper is to examine the potential importance of such \"long-term\"\nphase transitions on the dynamics of supernova explosion.\nIn the \"normal\" case of mechanical and local thermodynamic equilibrium, different phases\noccupy the corresponding radial shells of the PNS, and this spatial phase picture evolves\n\n\f4\ncontinuously and relatively slowly in time. However, if heating of the nuclear matter (which\nis mainly due to diffusion of neutrinos) is sufficiently strong and inhomogeneous, it can lead\nto a condition similar to that in an ordinary teakettle. Specifically, a bulk of particular phase\ncan overheat and become unstable with respect to phase transition, and small bubbles of the\nlighter phase can spontaneously appear in its volume. The bubbles will grow and, due to the\nArchimedean force, rise upwards. Henceforth, such a process is called boiling by analogy. In\nthis paper, we argue that this process can provide more efficient mechanism of heating the\nouter parts of the PNS (compared with the neutrino-diffusion and convection mechanisms)\nand generate additional pressure wave.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we give the basic thermodynamic description\nof the co-existence of various phases in supernova matter after the bounce. In Sec. III, we\nderive the criterion of boiling to occur, and, in Sec. IV, we provide our numerical estimates\nfor the values involved in this criterion using the tabulated equation of state from [31]. In\nSec. V, we consider a simple model of the boiling mechanism and derive numerical estimates\ncharacterizing the efficiency of this process. We summarize and discuss our results in Sec. VI.\n\nII.\n\nPHASE EQUILIBRIUM\n\nJust after the core bounce, the inward movement of the inner core significantly decreases,\nand the prompt shock wave moves outwards losing its energy mostly on nuclear dissociation\nand radiation of \u03bd \u03bd\u0304-pairs. The material within and around the PNS approaches a state\nof mechanical equilibrium (while the velocities of the convective motion are much smaller\nthan the appropriate first cosmic velocities). In contrast with the rapid collapse during the\npre-bounce stage of contraction, local thermal equilibrium is a good approximation for the\npost-bounce stage.\nBecause of the radial density gradient, the PNS at this stage has onion-like structure. The\ndensity of its inner core is higher than the nuclear saturation density, and the homogeneous\nmatter phase is thermodynamically preferred. In the outer layers of the PNS, the density\nis much less than the nuclear saturation density, and matter exists in the form of ordinary\nnuclei. A number of intermediate phases can exist between these two shells. Adjacent\nphases are separated by the surfaces of coexistence. Here we derive a simple condition of\ncoexistence of phases applied to the situation under consideration.\n\n\f5\nWe can consider a phase transition characterized by fixed pressure p, temperature T ,\nbaryon number B, electric charge C and lepton number L. The conservation laws of the last\nthree quantities imply the existence of the corresponding chemical potentials: \u03bcB , \u03bcC and\n\u03bcL . We can determine their values from the chemical potentials of the supernova matter\ncomponents (we suppose that the supernova matter consists only of neutrons, protons,\nelectrons and electron neutrinos):\n\u03bcn = \u03bcB ,\n\n\u03bcp = \u03bcB + \u03bcC ,\n\n\u03bce = \u03bcL \u2212 \u03bcC ,\n\n\u03bc\u03bd = \u03bcL .\n\n(1)\n\nSince the number of particle species is greater than the number of independent charges, we\nhave one more relation on the chemical potentials (the so-called beta-equilibrium condition):\n\u03bcp + \u03bce = \u03bcn + \u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(2)\n\nFor fixed values of p and T , our thermodynamic system tends to a state with a minimum\nvalue of the Gibbs free energy (see, e.g., [32])\n\u03a6=\n\nX\n\n\u03bci Ni = \u03bcB B + \u03bcC C + \u03bcL L .\n\n(3)\n\ni\n\nSince we are interested only in electrically neutral phases, we have\nC \u2261 0,\n\n(4)\n\nand the second term in (3) vanishes. The third term, \u03bcL L, does not change during the phase\ntransition because the electron neutrinos interact with nuclear matter very weakly.\nFinally, the condition of equilibrium between phases 1 and 2 is\n\u03bc1n (p0 , T0 , \u03bc\u03bd0 ) = \u03bc2n (p0 , T0 , \u03bc\u03bd0 ) ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the subscript \"0\" marks the values of the parameters right on the interface between\nthe two phases.\n\nIII.\n\nCRITERION OF BOILING\n\nLocal thermal equilibrium described in the previous section is continuously disturbed by\nthe process of diffusion of electron neutrinos away from the central region of the PNS. This\ncauses inhomogeneous heating of the bulk of nuclear matter. If this heating is sufficiently\n\n\f6\nstrong, it can lead to an overheat of a particular phase, which may result in its boiling -\nemergence of bubbles of the adjacent lighter phase in its bulk. These bubbles will then raise\nand grow, effectively transferring heat and lepton number. Boiling is a particular case of a\nnon-equilibrium first order phase transition. In this section, we derive a necessary condition\nof boiling in the form of a relation on the parameters of the supernova matter.\nAccording to Eq. (5), in the process of external heating, a heavier phase 1 becomes\nmetastable with respect to its transition to a lighter phase 2 if the condition is reached such\nthat\n\u03bc1n (p0 + \u03b4p, T0 + \u03b4T, \u03bc\u03bd0 + \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd ) > \u03bc2n (p0 + \u03b4p, T0 + \u03b4T, \u03bc\u03bd0 + \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd ) ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the positive increments of the thermodynamic variables correspond to their radial\ngradients.

In Table I, we show the\nparameters which are required in our analysis. Because the required values of derivatives\nare not listed in [31], we try to obtain them from interpolation. Namely, we use the finite\ndifferences:\n\u03bcn (p2 , T2 , \u03bc\u03bd2) \u2212 \u03bcn (p1 , T1 , \u03bc\u03bd1 ) \u2248\n\n\u2202\u03bcn\n\u2202\u03bcn\n\u2202\u03bcn\n(p2 \u2212 p1 ) +\n(T2 \u2212 T1 ) +\n(\u03bc\u03bd2 \u2212 \u03bc\u03bd1 ) ,\n\u2202p\n\u2202T\n\u2202\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(10)\n\nneglecting the higher derivatives. For each phase, we solve a system of three equations\nfor three unknown variables. The numerical values obtained in such a manner should be\nconsidered as estimates. They are presented in Table II.\nTo check whether the conditions of boiling are realized, we use the conventional values of\nthe other parameters. Numerical simulations (see, e.g., [19]) give the following estimates:\ng \u2248 1.0 \u00d7 1014 cm * sec\u22122 ,\n\nd\u03bc\u03bd\n\u2248 \u2212(10\u221220) MeV * km\u22121 ,\ndr\n\ndT\n< 0.\ndr\n\nUsing this data together with Table II, we obtain the following conditions for boiling:\n\n(11)\n\n\f8\n\u0010\n\nPhase\nNuclei\n\n\u2202\u03bcn\n\u2202p\n\n\u0011\n\n, fm3\n\nT,\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u22121.353\n\n\u0010\n\n\u2202\u03bcn\n\u2202T\n\n\u0011\n\np,\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u22122.626\n\n\u0010\n\n\u2202\u03bcn\n\u2202\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u0011\n\np,T\n\n0.125\n\nCheesed\n\n0.666\n\n5.182\n\n\u22120.201\n\nHomogeneous\n\n2.87\n\n1.289\n\n\u22120.0317\n\nTABLE II: The results for the partial derivatives.\n\n\u2022 for the transition between the nuclear and cheesed phase (\u03c1m \u2248 0.8 \u00d7 1014 g * cm\u22123 ),\ndT\n< \u2212(0.4\u22120.8) MeV * km\u22121 ;\ndr\n\n(12)\n\n\u2022 for the transition between homogeneous matter and cheesed phase (\u03c1m \u2248 1.6 \u00d7\n1014 g * cm\u22123 ),\ndT\n> \u2212(1.0\u22121.5) MeV * km\u22121 .\ndr\n\n(13)\n\nThe difference in the inequality signs in estimates (12) and (13) is connected with the\ndifference in the signs of the coefficients of the temperature gradients in (7) or (9) for the two\nphase transitions under consideration. Note that conditions (12) and (13) are overlapping\nand complementary, so it is very likely that one of them is satisfied. We, therefore, can expect\nthat boiling of nuclear matter can take place inside the supernova core. However, this only\ndemonstrates the possibility of principle, calling for additional thorough investigation of this\nissue.\n\nV.\n\nA MODEL\n\nIn this section, we construct a simplified model of phase transition between a heavier\nphase 1 and a lighter phase 2, which, for definiteness, we take to be the cheesed phase and\nthe phase of nuclei, respectively.\nWe assume spherical symmetry of the PNS, so that the cheesed phase is located in a\nspherical shell with radial coordinate from R \u2212 H to R. The free-fall acceleration on the\nupper boundary of this region is equal to\nGM\ng = 2 = 1.33 \u00d7 1014\nR\n\n\u0012\n\nM\nM\u2299\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n10 km\nR\n\nwhere M is the total mass inside the sphere of radius R.\n\n\u00132\n\ncm * sec\u22122 ,\n\n(14)\n\n\f9\nWe can estimate H using the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium:\n\u03c1gH \u2248 \u2206p ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u2206p is the dimension of the pressure interval in which the cheesed phase exists. According to Table I, this pressure interval is approximately equal to 0.83 MeV * fm\u22123 . We\nthus have\n\u2206p\n\u2248 1.0 \u00d7\nH\u2248\n\u03c1g\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2206p\n0.83 MeV * fm\u22123\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n1014 g * cm\u22123\n\u03c1\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n1.33 \u00d7 1014 cm * sec\u22122\ng\n\n\u0013\n\nkm . (16)\n\nIf we assume that boiling takes place in the whole volume of phase 1, then the total mass\nof the boiling matter can be estimated as1\n< 6.1 \u00d7 10\u22122\nMb \u2248 4\u03c0\u03c1R H \u223c\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2206p\n0.83 MeV * fm\u22123\n\n\u0013\n\nM.\n\n(17)\n\nThe densities of phases 1 and 2 are related by \u03c11 and \u03c12 = \u03c11 (1 \u2212 \u01eb), where \u01eb \u226a 1.\nAccording to [34], \u01eb is equal to 0.1 for the phase transition between the cheesed phase and\nhomogeneous matter phase, and to 0.2 for the transition between nuclei and cheesed phase.\nLower estimates for \u01eb are present in [31]: it equals to 0.07\u22120.08 for both phase transitions if\nthe entropy per baryon (which is conserved in the simulations) S/A = 1.0; for S/A = 1.5, the\nvalue \u01eb = 0.05 is obtained for the transition between nuclei and cheesed phase, and \u01eb = 0.01\nfor the transition between cheesed phase and homogeneous matter. To be conservative, we\nuse the lowest estimate in this paper, namely, \u01eb = 0.01.\nThe maximum acceleration which can be reached by a raising bubble (neglecting the\nliquid resistance) is\namax =\n\n\u01ebGM\n.\nR2\n\n(18)\n\nThe maximum velocity that can be reached by the bubble is then\ns\n\u0013 \u0012 14\n\u00131/2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0010 \u01eb \u0011\u0012\n10 g *cm\u22123\n\u2206p\n2\u01eb\u2206p\nkm * sec\u22121 . (19)\nvmax \u223c\n= 5100\n\u03c1\n10\u22122\n0.83 Mev * fm\u22123\n\u03c1\n1\n\nRecent simulations [33] show that the total mass of different phases between nuclei and homogeneous\nnuclear matter (collectively called \"pasta phases\" in [33]) inside the supernova just before the bounce can\namount to 0.13\u22120.30 M\u2299. This estimate somewhat differs from (17) because, before the bounce, one deals\nwith small pressure gradients in an (almost) free-falling matter, while, after the bounce, we have matter\nclose to hydrostatic equilibrium with its large pressure gradients. It is possible, in principle, that the\npre-bounce boiling, if it occurs, can affect the propagation of prompt shock wave, but we do not consider\nthis issue here.\n\n\f10\nMatter in the boiling volume will convectively move in both directions. We can expect\nthat roughly half of matter moves upwards (the bubbles and the surrounding matter) and\nthe other half moves downwards with the same average velocity (from the momentum conservation). Therefore, the \"convective boiling\" overturn will be established. We can try to\nestimate the maximum efficiency of this overturn.\nThe first effect to be discussed is heat transfer. If the bubbles fill half of the boiling\nvolume, the heating rate at the surface of the boiling layer is\n1\n\u00d7 4\u03c0R2 vmax q\n2\n\u00132 \u0010\n\u0012\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011\nq\nvmax\nR\n52\nerg * sec\u22121 . (20)\n= 7.7 \u00d7 10\n\u22121\n\u22123\n10 km\n5100 km * sec\n0.015 MeV *fm\n\nQ\u0307max \u223c\n\nHere, q is the specific volume heat of evaporation, and its value is estimated as q =\n0.015 MeV * fm\u22123 from [25]. The value (20) is comparable to the neutrino luminosity. This\nis, in principle, the upper estimate of heating rate which corresponds to maximal workload\nof the \"boiling machine.\" In reality, the boiling heat transfer should work together with diffusion and/or convection below and above the boiling shell, increasing the net heat transfer\nrate.2 This should lead to an increase in pressure behind the shock, providing more efficient\nconditions for shock revival.\nThe second effect is the momentum transfer. The maximum mechanical pressure that\nthe bubbles can exert is estimated as\n2\npmax \u223c \u03c1vmax\n= 2\u01eb\u2206p = 1.7 \u00d7 10\u22122 MeV * fm\u22123 ,\n\n(21)\n\nwhere the numerical value corresponds to the cheesed phase. This is much smaller than \u2206p\nsince \u01eb \u226a 1; therefore, including this contribution to pressure does not seriously affect our\nprevious calculation. But it can provide an additional barrier for the infalling matter to\nreach the inner core, reducing the final mass of the neutron star.\nWe should admit that most of the above estimates represent upper limits corresponding\nto the maximal workload of the \"boiling machine.\" In a subsequent paper, we will discuss\nthese processes in greater detail.\n2\n\nThis can be compared to an electric circuit with a series of resistances. As one of the resistances in the\nseries is shortened out, the total current increases.\n\n\f11\nVI.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper, we have demonstrated the possibility of boiling of nuclear liquid in the\nsupernova core after the bounce. If it occurs, it can lead to effects increasing the efficiency\nof the neutrino-driven mechanism of supernova explosions. Among these effects are the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 The increase of heat transfer rate from the inner core to the neutrinosphere. This\nincreases the mean neutrino energy, making the delayed-shock mechanism more efficient.\n\u2022 The increase of pressure in the boiling region. It provides an additional barrier between\nthe infalling matter and the inner core, thereby reducing the mass of the neutron-star\nremnant.\nWe expect that taking into account the effect of boiling in the conventional delayedshock/acoustic mechanism is important and will enable one to explain the energetics of the\nsupernova explosions in a more simple and self-consistent way.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nD.
