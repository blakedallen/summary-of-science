In this article, the Lorentzian manifolds isometrically embeddable in LN (for\nsome large N , in the spirit of Nash's theorem) are characterized as a a subclass of the set\nof all stably causal spacetimes; concretely, those which admit a smooth time function \u03c4 with\n|\u2207\u03c4 | > 1.

Nash [14] states that any C 3 Riemannian manifold can be isometrically\nembedded in any open subset of some Euclidean space RN for large N . Greene [9] and Clarke\n[7] showed independently, by means of simple algebraic reasonings, that Nash's theorem can be\nextended to indefinite (even degenerate) metrics, that is, any semi-Riemannian manifold can be\nsmoothly isometrically embedded in any open subset of semi-Euclidean space RN\ns for large enough\ndimension N and index s. Moreover, they also reduced the Nash value for N : Greene by using\nthe implicit function theorem by Schwartz [18], and Clarke by means of a technique inspired in\nKuiper's [11], which yields C k isometric embeddings with 3 \u2264 k < \u221e.\nNevertheless, a new problem appears when a semi-Riemannian manifold of index s is going to\nbe embedded in a semi-Euclidean space of the same index RN\ns . We will focus on the simplest case\ns = 1, i.e., the isometric embedding of a Lorentzian manifold (M, g) in Minkowski spacetime LN .\nSuch an embedding will not exist in general; for example, the existence of a causal closed curve in\nM contradicts the possibility of an embedding in LN . So, the first task is to characterize the class\nof isometrically embeddable spacetimes. This is the role of our first result (Section 3):\nTheorem 1.1 Let (M, g) be a Lorentzian manifold. The following assertions are equivalent:\n(i) (M, g) admits a isometric embedding in LN for some N \u2208 N.\n(ii) (M, g) is a stably causal spacetime with a steep temporal function, i.e., a smooth function\n\u03c4 such that g(\u2207\u03c4, \u2207\u03c4 ) \u2264 \u22121.\nAgain, this theorem is carried out by using some simple arguments, which essentially reduce\nthe hardest problem to the Riemannian case. So, this result (and the subsequent ones on isometric\nembeddings) is obtained under the natural technical conditions which comes from the Riemannian\nsetting: (a) (M, g) must be C k with 3 \u2264 k \u2264 \u221e, and all the other elements will be as regular as\npermitted by k, and (b) the smallest value of N is N = N0 (n) + 1, where n is the dimension of\nM and N0 (n) is the optimal bound in the Riemannian case (see [10] for a recent summary on this\nbound). We will not care about the local problem (see [9], a summary in Lorentzian signature\ncan be found in [19]); recall also that, locally, any spacetime fulfills condition (ii). So, the main\nproblem we will consider below, is the existence of a global steep temporal function as stated in\n(ii).\nIt is known that any stably causal spacetime admits a time function, which can be smoothed into\na temporal one \u03c4 (see Section 2 for definitions and background). Nevertheless, the condition of being\nsteep, |\u2207\u03c4 | \u2265 1 cannot be fulfilled for all stably causal spacetimes. In fact, a simple counterexample,\nwhich works even in the causally simple case, is provided below (Example 3.3). Notice that causal\nsimplicity is the level in the standard causal hierarchy of spacetimes immediately below global\nhyperbolicity. So, the natural question is to wonder if any globally hyperbolic spacetime admits a\nsteep temporal function \u03c4 .\nThe existence of embeddings in LN for globally hyperbolic spacetimes was stated by Clarke [7,\nSect. 2]. In his approach, a function f : M \u2192 L2 with a similar role to the steep temporal function\nabove is used. Nevertheless, as in other papers of that epoch, his construction of f is affected\nby the so-called \"folk problems\" of smoothability of causally-constructed functions. So, as will be\ndiscussed in the Appendix, if Clarke's proof is completed, then a new type of causally-constructed\nfunctions will be shown to be smooth (or at least smoothable).\n2\n\n\fApart from the consequence of the embedding in LN , the existence of a steep temporal \u03c4 is\nrelevant for the structure of globally hyperbolic spacetimes. In fact, both questions, problems of\nsmoothability and structure of globally hyperbolic spacetimes, are linked since Geroch's landmark\nabout topological splittings [8]. More precisely, recently any globally hyperbolic spacetime (M, g)\nhas been proved to admit a Cauchy orthogonal decomposition\nM = R \u00d7 S,\n\ng = \u2212\u03b2dT 2 + gT ,\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere \u03b2 > 0 is a function on M , gT is a Riemannian metric on ST := {T } \u00d7 S smoothly varying\nwith T , and each slice ST becomes a Cauchy hypersurface [4]. This result, which improves Geroch's\ntopological splitting M \u223c\n= R \u00d7 S as both, a differentiable and orthogonal one, is proved by showing\nthat, starting at Geroch's Cauchy time function, one could obtain a Cauchy smooth time function\nwith timelike gradient. Now, recall that, if this Cauchy temporal function is steep, then the function\n\u03b2 is upper bounded by one (Lemma 3.5). One of us suggested possible analytical advantages of a\nstrengthened decomposition (1.1), where additional conditions on the elements \u03b2, gT are imposed\n[13]. In particular, such a decomposition is called there a b-decomposition if the function \u03b2 (the\nlapse in relativist's terminology) is bounded. Our next result is then (Section 4):\nTheorem 1.2 Any globally hyperbolic spacetime admits a steep Cauchy temporal function T and,\nso, a Cauchy orthogonal decomposition (1.1) with (upper) bounded function \u03b2.\nRemark 1.3 From the technical viewpoint, the decomposition (1.1) was carried out in [4] by\nproving the existence of a Cauchy temporal function; moreover, a simplified argument shows the\nexistence of a temporal function in any stably causal spacetime ([4], see also the discussion in [17]).\nOur proof is completely self-contained, as it re-proves the existence of the Cauchy temporal function\nwith different and somewhat simpler arguments, as well as a stronger conclusion. Nevertheless, we\nuse some technical elements (remarkably, Proposition 4.2) which hold in the globally hyperbolic\ncase, but not in the stably causal one1 .\nSumming up, we emphasize the following consequences of previous theorems (for the second\none recall also Proposition 2.1).\nCorollary 1.4 (1) Any globally hyperbolic spacetime can be isometrically embedded in some LN .\n(2) A Lorentzian manifold is a stably causal spacetime if and only if it admits a conformal\nembedding in some LN . In this case, there is a representative of its conformal class whose timeseparation (Lorentzian distance) function is finite-valued.\nNotice also that, as an immediate consequence, a stably causal spacetime is not globally hyperbolic\nif and only if it is conformal to a spacetime non-isometrically embeddable in LN (see Example 3.3).\nAfter some preliminaries in the next section, Sections 3, 4 are devoted, respectively, to prove\nTheorems 1.1 and 1.2, as well as to discuss its optimality and consequences. From the technical\nviewpoint, it is worth pointing out the introduction of two elements in the first part of Section\n4: a semi-local temporal function for subsets of type J \u00b1 (p) \u2229 J \u2213 (S) (Prop. 4.2) and fat cone\ncoverings for any Cauchy hypersurface S (Prop. 4.4). Finally, in the Appendix, Clarke's technique\nfor globally hyperbolic spacetimes is discussed, and new causal problems on smoothability, which\nmay have their own interest, are suggested.\n1 Notice\n\nalso that only C 1 differentiability is needed for these results.\n\n3\n\n\f2\n\nPreliminaries\n\nIn what follows, any semi-Riemannian manifold will be C k , with 3 \u2264 k \u2264 \u221e as in Nash's theorem,\nand will be assumed to be connected without loss of generality. Any geometric element on the\nmanifold will be called smooth if it has the highest order of differentiability allowed by k. For an\nimmersion i : M \u2192 M\u0304 only injectivity of each dip , p \u2208 M is required; the injectivity of i, as well\nas being a homeomorphism onto its image, are required additionally for i to be an embedding.\nOur notation and conventions on causality will be standard as, for example, in [2] or [15].\nNevertheless, some terminology on the solution of the so-called \"folk problems of smoothability\"\nintroduced in [3, 4] are also used here (see [12] for a review). In particular, a Lorentzian manifold\n(M, g) is a manifold M endowed with a metric tensor g of index one (\u2212, +, . . . , +), a tangent\nvector v \u2208 Tp M in p \u2208 M , is timelike (resp. spacelike; lightlike; causal) when g(v, v) < 0 (resp,\ng(v, v) > 0; g(v, v) = 0 but v 6= 0; v is timelike or lightlike); so, following [12], the vector 0\nwill be regarded as non-spacelike and non-causal \u2013 even though this ispnot by any means the\nunique convention in the literature. For any vector v, we write |v| := |g(v, v)|. A spacetime\nis a time-orientable Lorentzian manifold, which will be assumed to be time-oriented (choosing\nany of its two time-orientations) when necessary; of course, the choice of the time-orientation for\nsubmanifolds conformally immersed in LN will agree with the induced from the canonical timeorientation of LN . The associated time-separation or Lorentzian distance function will be denoted\nby d, d(p, q) := supc\u2208\u03a9(p,q) l(c) where the supremum is taken over the space \u03a9(p, q) of futuredirected causal C 1 curves from p to q parametrized over the unit interval (if this space is empty, d\nR1\nis defined equal to 0), and l(c) := 0 |\u010b(t)|dt for such a curve. The following elements of causality\nmust be taken into account (they are explained in detail in [12]).\n\u2022 A time function t on a spacetime is a continuous function which increases strictly on any\nfuture-directed causal curve. Recently [4], it has been proved that this is also equivalent to the\nexistence of a temporal function \u03c4 , i.e., a smooth time function with everywhere past-directed\ntimelike gradient \u2207\u03c4 . This also ensures the folk claim that, for a spacetime, the existence\nof a time funtion is equivalent to be stably causal (i.e., if the lightcones of the spacetime are\nslightly opened then it remains causal), see [17, Fig. 2, Th. 4.15, Rem. 4.16] or [12, Th.\n3.56]. Along the present paper, a temporal function will be called steep if |\u2207\u03c4 | \u2265 1; as we\nwill see, not all stably causal spacetimes admit a steep temporal function.\n\u2022 After stable causality, the two next steps in the so-called causal ladder or causal hierarchy of\nspacetimes are: causal continuity (the volume functions t\u00b1 (p) = \u03bc(I \u00b1 (p)), p \u2208 M are time\nfunctions for one, and then for all, measure associated to any auxiliary semi-Riemannian\nmetric such that \u03bc(M ) < \u221e) and causal simplicity (the spacetime is causal with closed\nJ + (p), J \u2212 (q) for all p). A spacetime is called globally hyperbolic if it is causal and the\nintersections J + (p) \u2229 J \u2212 (q) are compact for all p, q \u2208 M (for the last two definitions, notice\n[6]). Globally hyperbolic spacetimes are the most relevant from both, the geometric and\nphysical viewpoints, and lie at the top of the causal hierarchy .\n\u2022 A time or temporal function is called Cauchy if it is onto on R and all its level hypersurfaces\nare Cauchy hypersurfaces (i.e., topological hypersurfaces crossed exactly once by any inextensible timelike curve). A classical theorem by Geroch [8] asserts the equivalence between:\n(i) to be globally hyperbolic, (ii) to admit a Cauchy hypersurface, and (iii) to admit a Cauchy\n4\n\n\ftime function. Moreover, the results in [3, 4] also ensure the equivalence with: (iv) to admit\na (smooth) spacelike Cauchy hypersurface, and (v) to admit a Cauchy temporal function T .\nAs a consequence, the full spacetime admits a orthogonal Cauchy decomposition as in (1.1).\n\u2022 Further properties have been achieved [5]: any compact acausal spacelike submanifold with\nboundary can be extended to a (smooth) spacelike Cauchy hypersurface \u03a3, and any such\n\u03a3 can be regarded as a slice T =constant for a suitable Cauchy orthogonal decomposition\n(1.1). Apart from the obvious interest in the foundations of classical General Relativity, such\nresults have applications in fields such as the wave equation or quantization, see for example\n[1, 16].\nThe following simple results are useful for the discussions below.\nProposition 2.1 Let (M, g) be a spacetime.\n(1) If \u03c4 is a temporal function then there exists a conformal metric g \u2217 = \u03a9g, \u03a9 > 0, such that\n\u03c4 is steep.\n(2) If T is a Cauchy temporal function and \u03c4 is a temporal function then T + \u03c4 is a Cauchy\ntemporal function. Moreover, T + \u03c4 is steep if so is either \u03c4 or T .\nProof. (1) As \u2207\u2217 \u03c4 = \u2207\u03c4 /\u03a9, choose any \u03a9 \u2264 |\u2207\u03c4 |2 .\n(2) T + \u03c4 is temporal (and steep, if so is any of the two functions) because of the reversed\ntriangle inequality. In order to check that its level hypersurfaces are Cauchy, consider any futuredirected timelike curve \u03b3 : (a\u2212 , a+ ) \u2192 M . It is enough to check that lims\u2192\u00b1a (T + \u03c4 )(\u03b3(s)) = \u00b1\u221e.\nBut this is obvious, because lims\u2192\u00b1a T (\u03b3(s)) = \u00b1\u221e (as T is Cauchy) and \u03c4 (\u03b3(s)) is increasing.\n\n3\n\nCharacterization of isometrically embeddable Lorentzian\nmanifolds\n\nProposition 3.1 Let (M, g) be a Lorentzian manifold. If there exists a conformal immersion\ni : M \u2192 LN then (M, g) is a stably causal spacetime.\nMoreover, if i is a isometric immersion, then: (a) the natural time coordinate t = x0 of LN\ninduces a steep temporal function on M , and (b) the time-separation d of (M, g) is finite-valued.\nProof. Notice that x0 \u25e6 i is trivially smooth and also a time function (as x0 increases on i \u25e6 \u03b3, where\n\u03b3 is any future-directed causal curve in M ), which proves stable causality.\nIf i is isometric, then |\u2207(x0 \u25e6 i)| \u2265 1 because, at each p \u2208 M , \u2207(x0 \u25e6 i)p is the projection of\n0\n\u2207xi(p) onto the tangent space di(Tp M ), and its orthogonal di(Tp M )\u22a5 in Ti(p) LN is spacelike. This\nproves (a), for (b) notice that the finiteness of d is an immediate consequence of the finiteness\nof the time-separation d0 on LN and the straightforward inequality d(p, q) \u2264 d0 (i(p), i(q)) for all\np, q \u2208 M .\nRemark 3.2 As a remarkable difference with the Riemannian case, Proposition 3.1 yields obstructions for the existence of both, conformal and isometric immersions in LN . In particular,\n5\n\n\fnon-stably causal spacetimes cannot be conformally immersed, and further conditions on the timeseparation are required for the existence of an isometric immersion. In fact, it is easy to find\neven causally simple spacetimes splitted as in (1.1) (with levels of T non-Cauchy) which cannot\nbe isometrically immersed in LN , as the following example shows.\nExample 3.3 Let M = {(x, t) \u2208 R2 : x > 0}, g = (dx2 \u2212dt2 )/x2 . This is conformal to R+ \u00d7R \u2282 L2\nand, thus, causally simple. It is easy to check that d(p, q) = \u221e for p = (1, \u22122), q = (1, 2) (any\nsequence of causal curves {\u03b3m }m connecting p and q whose images contain {(1/m, t) : |t| < 1} will\nhave diverging lengths). Thus, (M, g) cannot be isometrically immersed in LN .\nRecall that this example can be generalized, taking into account that a stably causal spacetime\nis non-globally hyperbolic if and only if it is conformal to a spacetime with a infinite-valued timeseparation (this holds for all strongly causal spacetimes, see [2, Th. 4.30]). So, in the conformal\nclass of any non-globally hyperbolic spacetime, there are spacetimes non isometrically inmersable\nin LN .\nNash's theorem will be essential for the proof of the following result.\nProposition 3.4 If a spacetime (M, g) admits a steep temporal function \u03c4 then it can be isometrically embedded in LN for some N .\nFor the proof, recall first.\nLemma 3.5 If a spacetime (M, g) admits a temporal function \u03c4 then the metric g admits a orthogonal decomposition\ng = \u2212\u03b2d\u03c4 2 + \u1e21\n(3.1)\nwhere \u03b2 = |\u2207\u03c4 |\u22122 and \u1e21 is a positive semi-definite metric on M with radical spanned by \u2207\u03c4 .\nIn particular, if \u03c4 is steep then \u03b2 \u2264 1.\nProof. The orthogonal decomposition (3.1) follows by taking \u1e21 as the trivial extension of g|(\u2207\u03c4 )\u22a5\n2\nto all T M . To determine the value of \u03b2, recall that d\u03c4 (\u2207\u03c4 ) = g(\u2207\u03c4, \u2207\u03c4 ) = \u2212\u03b2 (d\u03c4 (\u2207\u03c4 ))\nProof of Proposition 3.4. Consider the orthogonal decomposition in Lemma 3.5. Even though\nM does not need to split as a product R \u00d7 S (in an open subset of Ln , the vector field \u2207\u03c4 may be\nincomplete and the topology of the level sets may change), we can rewrite (3.1) as\ng = \u2212\u03b2d\u03c4 2 + g\u03c4 ,\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere each g\u03c40 is Riemannian metric on the slice S\u03c40 = \u03c4 \u22121 (\u03c40 ) varying smoothly with \u03c40 . Moreover, each p \u2208 M will be written as (\u03c4, x) where x \u2208 S\u03c4 (p) .\nNow, consider the auxiliary Riemannian metric\ngR := (4 \u2212 \u03b2)d\u03c4 2 + g\u03c4 .\nBy Nash's theorem, there exists an isometric embedding inash : (M, gR ) \u0592\u2192 RN0 . Then, a simple\ncomputation shows that the required isometric embedding i : (M, g) \u0592\u2192 LN0 +1 is just:\ni(\u03c4, x) = (2\u03c4, inash (\u03c4, x)) .\n\n6\n\n\fRemark 3.6 (1) From the proof, it is clear that the hypotheses on steepness can be weakened just\nby assuming that \u2207\u03c4 is lower bounded by some positive function \u01eb(\u03c4 ) > 0. In fact, this is equivalent\n2\n2\nto require \u03b2(\u03c4, x)R \u2264 A(\u03c4 )2 := 1/\u01eb(\u03c4 ), and\n\u0001 the proof would work by taking gR := (4A(\u03c4 ) \u2212\u03b2)d\u03c4 +g\u03c4\n\u03c4\nand i(\u03c4, x) = 2 0 A(s)ds, inash (\u03c4, x) . Nevertheless, no more generality would be obtained in this\ncase, because of the following two different arguments: (a) it is easy to check that, if this weaker\ncondition holds, then a suitable composition \u03c4\u0302 = f \u25e6 \u03c4 for some increasing function f on R would\nbe steep and temporal, and (b) the existence of a steep temporal function would be ensured by\ntaking the isometric embedding i : M \u0592\u2192 LN and restricting the natural coordinate t = x0 as in\nProposition 3.1.\n(2) Notice that Proposition 3.1 yields a necessary condition for the existence of a isometric\nembedding and Proposition 3.4 a sufficient one. Both together prove trivially Theorem 1.1, as\nwell as Corollary 1.4(2) (notice also Proposition 2.1(1)). Recall that, as a difference with Nash's\ntheorem, Proposition 3.4 does not allow to prove that the spacetime is isometrically embedded in an\narbitrarily small open subset, which cannot be expected now (notice that d(p, q) \u2264 d0 (i(p), i(q)) \u2264\n|x0 (i(p)) \u2212 x0 (i(q))|).\n\n4\n\nThe Cauchy orthogonal b-decomposition of any globally\nhyperbolic spacetime\n\nIn order to obtain a steep Cauchy temporal function in a globally hyperbolic spacetime, Proposition\n2.1(2) reduces the problem to find a steep temporal function (not necessarily Cauchy), as the\nexistence of a Cauchy temporal function is ensured in [4]. Nevertheless, we will prove directly the\nexistence of a steep Cauchy temporal function T , proving Theorem 1.2 with independence of the\nresults in [4] (recall Remark 1.3).\nSo, in what follows (M, g) will be a globally hyperbolic spacetime, and we will assume that t\nis a Cauchy time function as given by Geroch [8]. The following notation will be also used here.\nRegarding t,\nTab = t\u22121 ([a, b]),\nSa = t\u22121 (a).\nFor any p \u2208 M , jp is the function\nq 7\u2192 jp (q) = exp(\u22121/d(p, q)2 ).\nFor any A, B \u2282 M ,\nJ(A, B) := J + (A) \u2229 J \u2212 (B)\nin particular J(p, S) := J + (p) \u2229 J \u2212 (S) for S any (Cauchy) hypersurface.\n\n4.1\n\nSome technical elements\n\nIn the next two propositions we will introduce a pair of technical tools for the proof. But, first,\nconsider the following straightforward lemma, which will be invoked several times.\nLemma 4.1 Let \u03c4 be a function such that g(\u2207\u03c4, \u2207\u03c4 ) < 0 in some open subset U and let K \u2282 U\ncompact. For any function f there exists a constant c such that g(\u2207(f + c\u03c4 ), \u2207(f + c\u03c4 )) < \u22121 on\nK.\n7\n\n\fProof. Notice that at each x in the compact subset K the quadratic polynomial g(\u2207(f (x) +\nc\u03c4 (x)), \u2207(f (x) + c\u03c4 (x))) becomes smaller than -1 for some large c.\nThe following \"cone semi-time function\" will be useful from a technical viewpoint.\nProposition 4.2 Let S be a Cauchy hypersurface, p \u2208 J \u2212 (S). For all neighborhood V of J(p, S)\nthere exists a smooth function \u03c4 \u2265 0 such that:\n(i) Supp \u03c4 \u2282 V\n(ii) \u03c4 > 1 on S \u2229 J + (p).\n(iii) \u2207\u03c4 is timelike and past-directed in Int(Supp (\u03c4 ) \u2229 J \u2212 (S)).\n(iv) g(\u2207\u03c4, \u2207\u03c4 ) < \u22121 on J(p, S).\nProof. Let t be a Cauchy time function such that2 S = Sa := t\u22121 (a), and let K \u2282 V be a\ncompact subset such that J(p, Sa ) \u2282 Int (K). Compactness guarantees the existence of some \u03b4 > 0\nsuch that: for every x \u2208 K there exists a convex neighborhood Ux \u2282 V with \u2202 + Ux \u2282 J + (St(x)+2\u03b4 ),\nwhere \u2202 + Ux := \u2202Ux \u2229 J + (x). Now, choose a0 < a1 := t(p) < . . . < an = a with ai+1 \u2212 ai < \u03b4/2,\nand construct \u03c4 by induction on n as follows.\nFor n = 1, cover J(p, S) = {p} with a set type I + (x)\u2229Ux with x \u2208 K \u2229Taa01 and consider the corresponding function jx . For a suitable constant c > 0, the product cjx satisfies both, (ii), (iii) and\n(iv). To obtain smoothability preserving (i), consider the open covering {I \u2212 (Sa+\u03b4 ), I + (Sa+\u03b4/2 )}\nof M , and the first function 0 \u2264 \u03bc \u2264 1 of the associated partition of unity (Supp \u03bc \u2282 I \u2212 (Sa+\u03b4 )).\nThe required function is just \u03c4 = c\u03bcjx .\nNow, assume by induction that the result follows for any chain a0 < . . . < an\u22121 . So, for\nany k \u2264 n \u2212 1, consider J(p, Sak ) and choose a compact set K\u0302 \u2282 Int K with J(p, S) \u2282 Int K\u0302.\nThen, there exists a function \u03c4\u0302 which satisfies condition (i) above for V = Int K\u0302 \u2229 I \u2212 (Sak+1 ) and\na\nconditions (ii), (iii), (iv) for S = Sak . Now, cover K\u0302 \u2229 Takk+1 with a finite number of sets type\na\nk+1\nI + (xi ) \u2229 Uxi with xi \u2208 K \u2229 Tak\u22121\n, and considerP\nthe corresponding functions jxi .\nFor a suitable constant c > 0, the sum \u03c4\u0302 + c i jxi satisfies (iii) for S = Sak+1 . This is obvious\nin J \u2212 (Sak ) (for any c > 0), because of the convexity of timelike cones and the reversed triangle\na\ninequality. To realize that this can be also obtained in Takk+1 , where \u2207\u03c4 may be non-timelike,\nnotice that the support of \u2207\u03c4\u0302 |Taak+1 is compact, and it is included in the interior of the support of\nk\nP\ni jxi , where the gradient of the sum is timelike; so, use Lemma 4.1. As J(p, Sak+1 ) is compact,\nconditions (ii), (iv) can be trivially obtained by choosing, if necessary, a bigger c.\nFinally, smoothability (and (i)), can be obtained again by using the open covering {I \u2212 (Sak+1 +\u03b4 ),\nI + (Sak+1 +\u03b4/2 )} P\nof M , and the corresponding first function \u03bc of the associated partition of unity,\ni.e. \u03c4 = \u03bc(\u03c4\u0302 + c i jxi ).\nIn order to extend locally defined time functions to a global time one, one cannot use a partition\nof unity (as stressed in the previous proof, because \u2207\u03c4 is not always timelike when \u03bc is nonconstant). Instead, local time functions must be added directly and, then, coverings as the following\nwill prove useful.\n2 Along\n\nthe proof, we will use this lemma only for Cauchy hypersurfaces which are slices of a prescribed time\nfunction. However, any Cauchy hypersurface can be written as such a slice for some Cauchy time function. In fact,\nit is easy to obtain a proof by taking into account that both, I + (S) and I \u2212 (S) are globally hyperbolic and, thus,\nadmit a Cauchy time function \u2013for details including the non-trivial case that S is smooth spacelike and t is also\nrequired to be temporal, see [5]).\n\n8\n\n\fDefinition 4.3 Let S be a Cauchy hypersurface. A fat cone covering of S is a sequence of pairs\nof points p\u2032i \u226a pi , i \u2208 N such that both3 , C \u2032 = {I + (p\u2032i ) : i \u2208 N} and C = {I + (pi ) : i \u2208 N} yield a\nlocally finite covering of S.\nProposition 4.4 Any Cauchy hypersurface S admits a fat cone covering p\u2032i \u226a pi , i \u2208 N.\nMoreover, both C and C \u2032 yield also a finite subcovering of J + (S).\nProof. Let {Kj }j be a sequence of compact subsets of S satisfying Kj \u2282 Int Kj+1 , S = \u222aj Kj .\nEach Kj \\ Int Kj\u22121 can be covered by a finite number of sets type I + (pjk ), k = 1 . . . kj such\nthat I + (pjk ) \u2229 S \u2282 Kj+1 \\Kj\u22122 . Moreover, by continuity of the set-valued function I + , this last\ninclusion is fulfilled if each pjk is replaced by some close p\u2032jk \u226a pjk , and the required pairs p\u2032i (= p\u2032jk ),\npi (= pjk ), are obtained.\nFor the last assertion, take q \u2208 J + (S) and any compact neighborhood W \u220b q. As J \u2212 (W ) \u2229 S\nis compact, it is intersected only by finitely many elements of C, C \u2032 , and the result follows.\n\n4.2\n\nConstruction of the b-decomposition\n\na\nDefinition 4.5 Let p\u2032 , p \u2208 Ta\u22121\n, p\u2032 \u226a p. A steep forward cone function (SFC) for (a, p\u2032 , p) is a\n+\nsmooth function ha,p\u2032 ,p : M \u2192 [0, \u221e) which satisfies the following:\n\u2032\n1. Supp(h+\na,p\u2032 ,p ) \u2282 J(p , Sa+2 ),\n+\n2. h+\na,p\u2032 ,p > 1 on Sa+1 \u2229 J (p),\n+\n3. If x \u2208 J \u2212 (Sa+1 ) and h+\na,p\u2032 ,p (x) 6= 0 then \u2207ha,p\u2032 ,p (x) is timelike and past-directed, and\n+\n4. g(\u2207h+\na,p\u2032 ,p , \u2207ha,p\u2032 ,p ) < \u22121 on J(p, Sa+1 ).\n\nNow, Proposition 4.2 applied to S = Sa+1 , V = I \u2212 (Sa+2 ) \u2229 I + (p\u2032 ) yields directly:\nProposition 4.6 For all (a, p\u2032 , p) there exists a SFC.\nThe existence of a fat cone covering (Proposition 4.4) allows to find a function ha+ which in\nsome sense globalizes the properties of a SFC.\nLemma 4.7 Choose a \u2208 R and take any fat cone covering {p\u2032i \u226a pi |i \u2208 N}P\nfor S = Sa . For every\n+\npositive sequence {ci \u2265 1|i \u2208 N}, the non-negative function h+\na := (|a| + 1)\ni ci ha,p\u2032 ,pi satisfies:\ni\n\n1.

It could be\ndropped if one looks only for a temporal function and, then, uses Proposition 2.1(2).\n4 This\n\n9\n\n\fProof. Obvious.\nThe gradient of h+\na will be spacelike at some subset of J(Sa+1 , Sa+2 ). So, in order to carry out\nthe inductive process which proves Theorem 1.2, a strengthening of Lemma 4.7 will be needed.\n+\nLemma 4.8 Let h+\na \u2265 0 as in Lemma 4.7. Then there exists a function ha+1 which satisfies all\nthe properties corresponding to Lemma 4.7 and additionally:\n+\n+\n+\ng(\u2207(h+\na + ha+1 ), \u2207(ha + ha+1 )) < \u22121\n\non J(Sa+1 , Sa+2 )\n\n(4.1)\n\n(so, this inequality holds automatically on all J(Sa , Sa+2 )).\nProof. Take a fat cone covering {p\u2032i \u226a pi |i \u2208 N} for S = Sa+1 . Now, for each pi consider a constant\n+\nci \u2265 1 such that ci h+\na+1,p\u2032i ,pi + ha satisfies inequality (4.1) on J(pi , Sa+2 ) (see Lemma 4.1). The\nP\n+\nrequired function is then ha+1 = (|a| + 2) i ci h+\na+1,p\u2032 ,pi .\ni\n\nNow, we have the elements to complete our main proof.\nProof of Theorem 1.2. Consider the function h+\na provided by Lemma 4.7 forPa = 0, and apply\n\u221e\ninductively Lemma 4.8 for a = n \u2208 N. Then, we obtain a function T + = n=0 h+\nn \u2265 0 with\n+\nnowhere spacelike gradient, which is a steep temporal function on J (S0 ) with support in J + (S\u22121 ).\nAnalogously, one can obtain a function T \u2212 \u2265 0 which is a steep temporal function with the reversed\ntime orientation, on J \u2212 (S0 ). So, T = T + \u2212 T \u2212 is clearly a steep temporal function on all M .\nMoreover, the levels hypersurfaces of T are Cauchy. In fact, consider any future-directed causal\ncurve \u03b3, and reparametrized it with the Cauchy time function t. Then,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n+\n+\nlim T (\u03b3(t)) = lim T (\u03b3(n + 1)) \u2265 lim hn (\u03b3(n + 1)) = \u221e,\nlim T (\u03b3(t)) = \u2212\u221e,\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nn\u2208N\n\nt\u2192\u2212\u221e\n\nn\u2208N\n\nand \u03b3 crosses all the levels of T , as required.\n\n5\n\nAppendix\n\nClarke [7] developed the following method in order to embed isometrically any manifold M endowed\nwith a semi-Riemannian (or even degenerate) metric g in some semi-Euclidean space RN\ns . First,\nhe proved that, for some p \u2265 0, there exists a function f : M \u2192 Rpp such that the (possibly\ndegenerate) pull-back metric g(f ) on M induced from f satisfies gR = g \u2212 g(f ) > 0. So, the\nresults for positive definite metrics are applicable to (M, gR ), and one can construct a Riemannian\nisometric embedding fR : M \u2192 RN0 (fR can be constructed from Nash result, even though Clarke\ndevelops a technique to reduce the Nash value for N0 ). Then, the required embedding i : M \u2192 RN\np\nis obtained as a product i(x) = (f (x), fR (x)) for N = p + N0 .\nIn Lorentzian signature, Clarke's optimal value for p is 2. Nevertheless, he claims that, if (M, g)\nis a globally hyperbolic spacetime, then one can take p = 1 [7, Lemma 8]. Our purpose in this\nAppendix is to analyze this question and show:\n(A) the required condition g \u2212 g(f ) > 0 on f is essentially equivalent to be a steep temporal\nfunction, and\n(B) the success of the construction of f in [7, Lemma 8] depends on a problem of smoothability,\nwhich may have interest in its own right.\n10\n\n\fIn order to make these points clear, we will particularize the proof of [7, Lemma 8] to a very simple\ncase, and will follow most of the notation there. As a previous remark, Clarke assumed that the\nexistence of a temporal function \u03c4 had already been proved, as this question (one of the prominent\nfolk problems of smoothability) seemed true then. At any case, we can assume now even that \u03c4 is\nCauchy temporal. Then, consider a globally hyperbolic spacetime which can be written as\n(R2 , g)\n\ng = \u2212V 2 d\u03c4 2 + M 2 dy 2 ,\n\nwhere (\u03c4, y) are the natural coordinates of R2 and V, M are two positive functions on R2 . Easily,\na function f : R2 \u2192 R11 (= L1 ) satisfies g \u2212 g(f ) > 0 if and only if:\n\u2212 V 2 (\u2202y f )2 + M 2 (\u2202\u03c4 f )2 > V 2 M 2 ,\n\n(5.1)\n\nand this is trivially equivalent to g(\u2207f, \u2207f ) < \u22121. This proves (A) in our particular example and,\ntaking into account Remark 3.6(1), it seems general.\nNow, consider any smooth function \u03c3 \u2265 0 on R2 invariant through the flow of \u2207\u03c4 such that\n\u03c3 \u22121 ([0, s]) is compact for all s, and let Y = \u03c3 \u22121 ([0, 1]); in our simplified example, we can put\n\u03c3(\u03c4, y) = |y|2 . Outside Y the two lightlike vector fields,\nA\u00b1 = M \u2202\u03c4 \u00b1 V \u2202\u03c3 ,\nare well defined, and equation (5.1) can be also rewritten as\n(A+ f )(A\u2212 f ) > V 2 M 2 .\n\n(5.2)\n\nSo, the crux is to construct a function f which satisfies (5.2) outside Y , among other conditions.\nClarke's proposal is the following. Let\nH \u00b1 (t, s) = J \u00b1 (\u03c4 \u22121 (0)) \u2229 J \u2213 (\u03c4 \u22121 (t) \u2229 \u03c3 \u22121 ([0, s])).\nAfter choosing a certain volume element \u03c9, the function f is defined as:\nZ\nf (x) =\n\u03c9\n\n(5.3)\n\nH + (\u03c4 (x),\u03c3(x))\n\nwhenever \u03c4 (x) > \u01eb > 0 and outside a neighborhood of5 Y . Notice that A\u00b1 are future directed, and\nA+ points outwards the region \u03c3 \u22121 ([0, \u03c3(x)]) at each x \u2208 M \\Y . So, if f is C 1 , then one would\nexpect A+ (f ) > A\u2212 (f ) > 0. Moreover, Clarke claims that (5.2) can be also achieved by choosing\n\u03c9 large enough (and eventually, a redefinition of \u03c4 ).\nAt what extent can one assume that f is C 1 (or, at least, that it can be smoothed to a function\nwhich satisfies the required conditions)?\nFor each measurable subset Z of the spacetime manifold,\nR\nconsider its \u03c9-measure \u03bc(Z) = Z \u03c9. In any causally continuous spacetime M it is known that\nthe functions x 7\u2192 \u03bc(J \u00b1 (x)) are continuous, if \u03bc(M ) < \u221e. Moreover, if M is globally hyperbolic\nand S is any topological Cauchy hypersurface, then I + (S) is a globally hyperbolic spacetime in its\n5 For \u03c4 (x) < \u2212\u01eb < 0, the function f is negative and defined dually in terms of H \u2212 , for \u03c4 (x) = 0, f is 0, and\na more technical definition is given for f on a neighborhood of Y \u222a \u03c4 \u22121 (0). However, this is not relevant for our\ndiscussion.\n\n11\n\n\fown right, and the function x 7\u2192 \u03bc(J(S, x)), x \u2208 I + (S), becomes continuous, even if we drop the\nassumption about the finiteness of \u03bc. Nevertheless, neither the functions \u03bc(J \u00b1 (x)) nor \u03bc(J(S, x))\nare smooth in general (see figure). In Clarke's case, the fact that S = \u03c4 \u22121 (0) is not only smooth\nbut spacelike, may help to stablish smoothness. However, recall that the definition of f also uses\nthe function \u03c3. Such a \u03c3 can be defined by taking some auxiliary complete Riemannian metric\non S, and smoothing along the cut locus the squared distance function to a fixed point y0 \u2208 S.\nThe behavior of f at the points x \u2208 M such that the boundary of S \u2229 J \u2213 (\u03c4 \u22121 (x) \u2229 \u03c3 \u22121 ([0, \u03c3(x)]))\nintersects the cut locus may complicate the situation.\nSumming up, even assuming \u2013as a necessary element of Clarke's proof\u2013 the existence of a\ntemporal function, which was proved in [4] and is re-proved in a shorter form here, the smoothability\nof f remains as a non-trivial problem. The solution of this question not only would complete\nClarke's proof but also may have interest in its own right.\n\nFigure 1: The depicted open subset of L2 is globally hyperbolic, and S a smooth Cauchy hypersurface. Functions J + (x) and J(S, x) are not smooth at z \u2208 I + (S).\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe comments by Prof. L.
