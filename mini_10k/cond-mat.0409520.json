The competition between\nthermal fluctuations and pinning can lead to different\nphases such as vortex liquids, Bose and vortex glasses,\nand a more ordered Bragg glass3,4,5,6,7 .\nConsiderable theoretical progress can be made in\nstudying two-dimensional superconductors with an inplane magnetic field, where the vortex lines form one\ndimensional arrays. Experimentally this situation can\nbe realized using thin platelet superconducting samples8 .\nThe statistical mechanics of such systems is equivalent to\nthe physics of interacting bosons in one dimension. The\nlow-energy and long wavelength properties can then be\ndescribed within a Luttinger-liquid formalism. For example, one can relate the Bose-glass to vortex-liquid phase\ntransition in the presence of disordered columnar defects3\nto the superfluid-insulator transition in a system of interacting bosons with quenched disorder9 . One finds that\nfor a given disorder strength the system can be tuned\nacross the phase transition by changing the temperature\n(which is proportional to g, the Luttinger-liquid parameter). The mapping is different with point disorder, which\nis equivalent to time-dependent point impurities in the\nboson problem. In this case there is a subtle second order\nphase transition between a \"supersolid\" (with algebraic\norder both in boson and translational order parameter)\nand glassy phase5,10,11,12,13 with decreasing temperature.\nAnother important feature of vortex physics in (1+1)\ndimensions is the remarkable response to a single columnar defect. As argued, originally in the quantummechanical context14 and later for vortex arrays, even\na very weak columnar pinning potential can grow to infinity under renormalization group (RG) transformations\nwhen g < 1. It was shown that the relevance of a single\ncolumnar pin at low temperatures leads to a strong suppression of a vortex tilt induced by a weak transverse\nmagnetic field. However, at high temperatures (such\n\nthat g > 1) the pin is less effective, regardless of its\nmicroscopic strength. Remarkably, the onset of the relevance (or irrelevance) of a single columnar pin and point\ndisorder occurs at the same temperature T \u22c6 , such that\ng(T \u22c6 ) = 1.\nIf both point disorder and a columnar pin are present\n(see Fig. 1) then at low temperatures (g < 1) one expects\na competition between the two: a growing columnar pin\nstrength under renormalization leads to stronger correlated pinning of vortex lines at long length scales. On\nthe other hand, the increasing point disorder tends to destroy the effect of the pin on distant regions. Although\nit was argued that point disorder would always render a\nsingle columnar defect irrelevant at long wavelengths in\nRef. [15], the precise nature of this competition and the\ndifferent pinning properties above and below the vortex\nglass transition were left unresolved. A detailed study of\nthis competition is a primary goal of the present paper.\nWe show that in the thermodynamic limit the pinning\nstrength is strongest precisely at the transition point T \u22c6\nwhere g = 1. In particular, the number of pinned vortex\nlines is a nonmonotonic function of g and strongly peaked\nat g = 1. For finite systems the position of the maximum\nis slightly shifted to lower values of g (see Fig. 4). We emphasize that irrelevance of a single columnar pin does not\nimply irrelevance of an array of pins. In fact, as it was\nargued in Refs. [3,4], the vortex glass phase formed by\npoint disorder is unstable towards infinitesimal disorder\nin columnar pins, which results in a Bose glass phase.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we introduce the model and describe the mapping to a Luttinger liquid. In Sec. III the renormalization equations\ndescribing the long wavelength physics are derived. Then\nin Sec. IV we analyze density oscillations of vortex lines\nnear the columnar pin above and below the vortex glass\ntransition. At the transition point g = 1, we demonstrate that the problem maps onto free Fermions in a\ntime-dependent disorder potential. This mapping allows\ncomputation of density oscillations of vortex lines near\nthe columnar pin which we then compare with the renormalization group predictions. In Sec. V we discuss the\n\n\f2\n\n\u03c4\nL\u03c4\nx\n\nLx\nFIG. 1: Schematic view of a planar superconductor with point\ndisorder and a columnar pin, represented by a notch cut into\nthe sample.

(6) with Eq. (4) allows us to identify\nthe Luttinger-liquid parameter g as\ng=\n\nresponse of vortex lines to a weak transverse magnetic\nfield in the presence of a single columnar pin. Finally\nin Sec. VI we summarize our results and present conclusions. Appendix A estimates the parameter range necessary to see the effects discussed here, while Appendix B\ndescribes details of our free fermion calculation.\nII.\n\nThe rescalings in Eq.

These equations are subject to the initial conditions \u03ba(l = 0) = 0, \u2206(l = 0) = \u22060 ,\nand V (l = 0) = V0 , with \u22060 and V0 being the bare couplings. Note that the Luttinger-liquid parameter g does\nnot change under renormalization11 .\n\nIn the absence of point disorder (\u2206(l) \u2261 0 and \u03ba(l) \u2261\n0) our results reduce to those obtained by Kane and\nFisher14 . In this case the columnar pin is relevant for\ng < 1 and irrelevant for g > 1. If V \u2261 0 then our\nequations are equivalent to those first derived by Cardy\nand Ostlund11 and later extensively explored for different\nproblems5,10,12,13 . Equations (15)-(17) imply that point\ndisorder also becomes relevant when g < 1. Contrary to\nbosons interacting with many impurities9 (which is the\nanalogue of many columnar defects for a flux problem),\nthere is an intermediate fixed point with a finite value\n\u2206\u22c6 \u2261 liml\u2192\u221e \u2206(l) = O(\u01eb) which continuously emerges\nfrom a pure Gaussian fixed point for g < 1. This makes\nthe RG approach tractable on both sides of g = 1. Note\nalso that when g < 1, \u03ba(l) \u2192 \u221e, suggesting nontrivial\ncorrelations in this phase. We comment that there are\nsome claims questioning the applicability of Eqs. (15)(17) in the glass phase (g < 1). In Ref. [25] it was\nargued that a replica symmetric solution becomes unstable for g < 1, resulting in different correlation functions than predicted by the replica symmetric renormalization group. However, there is still no evidence showing that this instability actually occurs. Moreover, numerical results of Ref. [26] confirm one of the crucial\npredictions of Eqs. (15)-(17) at g < 1; namely, the unusual behavior of the density-density correlation function\nG(x) \u221d exp(\u2212A ln2 |x|).\nIn deriving equations (16)-(18), we implicitly assumed\nthat the cutoff is symmetric in the \u03c4 and x directions. In\ngeneral this is not true. The anisotropy in the cutoff will\nresult in different initial renormalizations of \u03ba\u03c4 and \u03bax .\nHowever, at large length scales the flows for \u03ba\u03c4 and \u03bax\nlook the same and the asymmetry disappears13 .\nEquations (15)-(18) contain nonuniversal cutoff dependent terms.

Note that even\nthough a term of the order of \u01eb2 appears in Eq. (31),\nits presence is justified. Indeed, according to Eq. (22),\nat large l we have \u03ba \u221d \u2206\u22c6 2 l \u223c \u01eb2 l. It is easy to see\nthat higher order corrections in \u01eb to the renormalization\ngroup flow equations (in particular to Eq. (20)) will result\nin terms of the order of O(\u01eb3 ) in Eq. (30).\nThe parameter l0 defined in Eq. (32) sets a characteristic length scale \u039b\u22121 el0 , separating long and short\nlength behavior of the pinning potential. As we find below, it also determines the behavior of various observables. Thus, for \u01eb > 0, at small l the pinning potential\nfirst grows under the\nq RG transformations to the value\n \u0303 0 . Then, for larger l, V (l) goes\nVmax \u2248 V (l0 ) \u2248 V0 \u01eb/\u2206\nto zero faster than exponentially. We comment that for\ng > 1, l0 sets the characteristic scale beyond which \u2206(l)\nbecomes negligibly small and \u03ba(l) stops renormalizing.\nNote that the columnar pin is asymptotically irrelevant in the presence of point disorder for all values of\ng. The mechanisms, which lead to this are different below and above the vortex glass transition. Thus in the\nhigh-temperature phase g \u2265 1 thermal fluctuations are\nresponsible for the irrelevance of V at l \u2192 \u221e. In contrast, in the low-temperature glass phase g < 1 point\ndisorder is the cause of the flow of V to zero at large l.\nThe distance when the columnar pin starts feeling effects\nof point disorder and becomes irrelevant grows with de \u0303 0 . As discussed below, in infinite samples, the\ncreasing \u2206\neffect of the columnar pin is strongest (least irrelevant)\nprecisely at g = 1.\nIn the weak disorder limit one can compute various correlation functions using the renormalization group analysis sketched above. In what follows we will discuss several\nquantities of interest.\n\n\f5\nIV.\n\nDENSITY OSCILLATIONS AND THE FREE\nFERMION LIMIT\nA.\n\nh\u03b4n(x)i \u221d V0 e\u2212\u01eb\n\nDensity oscillations near a columnar pin\n\nSince the columnar pinning potential is always irrelevant when point disorder is present, it can be treated perturbatively at sufficiently large length scales.

Explicitly, one\nfinds\nR\u221e\n\u22122\ndl[g+\u03ba(l)][1\u2212J0 (re\u2212l )]\n0\nf (x, \u03c4 ) \u2248 e\n,\n(38)\n\u221a\nwhere r = x2 + \u03c4 2 \u039b is the distance between the two\npoints measured in the units of the original cutoff \u039b. The\nBessel function J0 (x) appearing in Eq. (38) and in other\nformulas below is nonuniversal and depends on the actual\ndetails of the cutoff procedure. Instead of J0 (x) one can\n \u0303\nuse another cutoff function J(x),\ne.g., a Gaussian, as long\n \u0303 \u2192 0) \u2192 1 and\nas it satisfies general requirements J(x\n \u0303\nJ(x \u2192 \u221e) \u2192 0. If the disorder is absent in Eq. (38), i.e.,\n\u03ba \u2261 0, we recover the well-known result for the Luttinger\nliquid f (x, \u03c4 ) \u221d r\u22122g . If g \u2265 1 then at long distances f\nis given more generally by f (x, \u03c4 ) \u221d r\u2212\u03b7 [12], where\n\u03b7 = 2[g + \u03ba(\u221e)].\n\n(39)\n\nThus, when point disorder is irrelevant, the exponent of\nthe correlation decay becomes non-universal. For g < 1\nthe asymptotic expression for f becomes11,12 f (x, \u03c4 ) \u221d\n2\n2\ne\u2212\u01eb ln x .\nUpon using Eqs. (35) and (38) we find that the behavior of h\u03b4n(x)i at large distances for g \u2265 1 is\nh\u03b4n(x)i \u221d V0\n\ncos 2\u03c0n0 x\n.\nx\u03b7\u22121\n\ndecaying correlations of the form (40) with \u03b7 \u2248 2g for\n1 \u226a x \u226a exp(l0 ) to a faster decay\n\n(40)\n\nThis equation is valid only for x >\n\u223c exp(l0 ), where l0 is\ngiven by Eq.

The transformation also holds\nin the presence of a columnar pin and point disorder.\nThe columnar pin and the point disorder correspond\nto static and random time-dependent potentials, respectively. The time-dependent Hamiltonian which describes\nthe fermions then reads\nHf (x, \u03c4 ) = \u2212\n\n1 d2\n+ U (x, \u03c4 ) + V0 (x),\n2m dx2\n\n(42)\n\nwhere U (x, \u03c4 ) is a random potential satisfying\nU (x1 , \u03c41 )U (x2 , \u03c42 ) = \u22060 \u03b4(x1 \u2212 x2 )\u03b4(\u03c41 \u2212 \u03c42 ).\n\n(43)\n\nThe mass m (corresponding to the tilt modulus in the\noriginal flux line problem) sets the Fermi velocity vf =\nkf /m (where kf is the Fermi momentum), which represents the sound velocity in the original boson/vortex\nproblem.\nIf the sample length L\u03c4 in the timelike direction is\nlarge, then the partition function of the vortex array is\nproportional to an appropriate matrix element of the corresponding quantum problem28\nR\u221e R\n\u2212\nd\u03c4 dxHf (x,\u03c4 )\nZ = hG|T\u03c4 e 0\n|Gi,\n(44)\nwhere T\u03c4 is the usual (imaginary) time-ordering symbol.\nThis expression is the quantum-mechanical expectation\nvalue of the evolution operator calculated in its manyfermion ground state |Gi, for a given realization of point\ndisorder. If the Hamiltonian Hf is time independent,\nthen Eq. (44) reduces to the zero-temperature quantum\npartition function. For N noninteracting fermions the\nground state can be written as a Slater determinant of\nthe single particle states. However, because the Hamiltonian Hf is time dependent, the states forming the Slater\ndeterminant will not be the eigenstates of Hf . Instead,\nthey will consist of the N largest eigenvalues of the evolution operator (see Appendix B for further details). Once\n|Gi is known one can easily calculate various observables.\nHere we consider the vortex line density\nhn(x)i =\n\n1\nhG|c\u2020 (x)c(x)|Gi,\nZ\n\n(45)\n\nwhere c(x) is a fermionic annihilation operator.

(40))\nfor different strengths of point disorder, we extract the\nexponent \u03b7/2. The results are plotted in Fig. 3. Within\nthe error bars the dependence of \u03b7 on \u22060 is linear as\npredicted by the renoramlization group analysis for g = 1\n(see Eqs.

We describe\ndetails of this calculation in Appendix B. Here we just\nmention that we discretize both space and time and write\nthe evolution operator as a product of transfer matrices.\nWe take a periodic array of M = 201 sites in the space direction and of size L = 50 in the timelike direction. The\nparticle filling factor is taken to be approximately 0.1,\nso that the ground state eigenfunction |Gi is the Slater\ndeterminant of the 21 highest eigenstates. We took the\nodd number of sites to have an exact inversion symmetry\naround the columnar pin in the finite size system and we\ntook the odd number of eigenstates to avoid complications arising from the double degeneracy of the energy\nspectrum in the absence of point disorder. A columnar defect of strength V0 = 0.1 is placed in the central\nsite, x0 = 101. Point disorder is modeled by a uniformly\ndistributed uncorrelated random potential on each site\nof the space-time lattice: U (x, \u03c4 ) \u2208 [\u2212U0 , U0 ], so that\n\u22060 = U02 /3. For the effective mass in Eq. (42) we choose\nm = 5 corresponding to a hopping amplitude J = 0.1 in\nthe discretized model (see Appendix B). For each configuration of disorder we numerically find the ground state\n|Gi and the fermion density and finally average over different realizations of point disorder. In this way we obtain \"Friedel oscillations\" of density for different values of\n\u22060 . In Fig. 2 we plot a calculated density profile of vortex\nlines for U0 = 10\u22123/2 corresponding to \u22060 \u2248 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 for\na particular realization of point disorder (top graph) and\nafter averaging over about 130 000 disorder realizations\n \u0303 0 (23) the chosen strength\n(bottom graph).

It can be shown11\nthat under the renormalization group bosons are relevant on both sides of the transition g = 1. Thus, if isolated bosons (dislocations) are permitted, they destroy\nthe supersolid-vortex glass transition.\n\nV.\n\nA.\n\nRESPONSE TO A TRANSVERSE\nMAGNETIC FIELD\n\nAnother way to determine the effect of a single columnar pin on the flux array is to study the response of\nthe vortices to a weak transverse magnetic field h. In\nRefs. [17] and [15] it was argued that in the absence\nof point disorder in the thermodynamic limit an infinite\nnumber of vortices can be pinned by a single columnar\ndefect in the limit h \u2192 0. While for g > 1 the fraction\nof pinned vortex lines goes to zero with the sample size,\nfor g < 1 almost all lines get pinned. In the presence\nof point disorder, because the columnar pin is always irrelevant, the situation is quite different. In fact, as we\nshow below, the number of pinned vortices Np (g) has a\nmaximum around g = 1.\n\n(52)\nIn particular, for g \u2265 1 the density modulation at large\ndistances and weak magnetic fields is readily obtained\nusing Eq.

One way to deal\nwith this is to recall that in physical systems the integral over the imaginary time is limited by the sample\nsize \u03c4 \u2208 [\u2212L\u03c4 /2, L\u03c4 /2]. Then, in Eq. (62) we can make\nsubstitutions \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03be/2, \u03c4 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c4 \u2212 \u03be/2 and use the\nidentity\nZ L\u03c4 /2\nlim\nd\u03c4 [sgn(\u03c4 + \u03be/2) \u2212 sgn(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03be/2)] = \u03be.\nL\u03c4 \u2192\u221e\n\n\u2212L\u03c4 /2\n\n(63)\nIn this way our final expression for the number of pinned\nvortices becomes\nZ\ngV 2 n0\nNp \u2248 0\nd\u03be \u03bef (0, \u03be) sin 2\u03c0h\u03be .\n(64)\n4\u03c0h\nCase I, g \u2265 1.

Dividing this current difference by the average slope h of the\nvortex lines in the absence of the pin gives the effective\nnumber of vortices which do not participate in the current flow due to the columnar defect. We identify this\nas the pinning number. It is easy to see that the lowest\norder correction to the current due to the pinning potential appears in second order perturbation theory.

To see this we observe that if\nL\u03c4 is finite, then the integral over \u03be in Eq. (65) is taken\nwithin a finite interval |\u03be| \u2264 L\u03c4 . If Lx is bounded then\nit is easy to show that the correlation function f (0, \u03be)\ndecays exponentially f (0, \u03be) \u221d e\u2212\u03be/Lx for \u03be > Lx and the\nintegral in Eq.

We obtained the renormalization group flow equations for the pinning strength in the\npresence of point disorder and found that the columnar\npin is irrelevant at the largest length scales (by different\nmechanisms) both for g > 1 and g < 1, which is in contrast to the pure system where it is relevant at g < 1.\nBecause the onset of relevance of point disorder also occurs at g = 1 we were able to quantitatively solve the RG\nequations for g close to 1. In particular we found that if\ndisorder strength is weak, then at g < 1 the renormalized pinning potential V first\nq grows with the increasing\n \u0303 0 and then goes to\nlength scale to Vmax \u2248 V0 (1 \u2212 g)/\u2206\nzero faster than exponentially.\n\n0.82\n0.80\n0.78\n0.76\n0.74\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\nL\nFIG. 4: (a) Number of pinned vortices versus the Luttinger \u03030 =\nliquid parameter g at a fixed point disorder strength (\u2206\n0.2) for different sample sizes L and (b) the position of the\nmaximum (g \u2217 ) as a function of L. The value of g \u2217 approaches\n1 with increasing L.\n\nthe pinning number will have a maximum as a function of\nthe Luttinger-liquid parameter at g \u2248 1. If L is not too\nlarge (or tilt is finite) then at a given disorder strength\nthe maximum of Np (h = 0) will occur at some g \u2217 < 1.\nIndeed, if g approaches 1 from below, then Np (h = 0) diverges exponentially (see Eq. (68)). In turn, this implies\nthat if L is finite then the system will be insensitive to\nthe saturating effect of point disorder if g is very close\nto 1 and the pinning will be quite effective for g <\n\u223c 1\nas in the case without point disorder17 . These simple\nconsiderations agree with numerical evaluation of Np according to Eq. (64), which are plotted in Fig. 4. The\nposition of the maximum (g \u2217 ) versus the system size is\nalso shown in this figure. It clearly approaches g \u2217 = 1 as\n\nUsing renormalization group analysis we calculated\n\"Friedel oscillations\" of the vortex line density near the\ncolumnar pin. In particular we showed that at g \u2265 1 density fluctuations decay as a power law \u03b4n(x) \u221d 1/x\u03b7\u22121 ,\nwhere the exponent \u03b7 is shifted upwards from \u03b7 = 2g due\n \u0303 0 \u226a g \u2212 1, then the exponent \u03b7 beto point disorder. If \u2206\ncomes x independent only at extremely (exponentially)\nlarge x. At intermediate x one would observe a power law\ndecay of \u03b4n(x) with an effective exponent smoothly varying with x. In the case g = 1 (which corresponds to dilute\nvortices with a hard core repulsion) we mapped the problem to that of free fermions, which we exactly solved by\ndirect diagonalization. We found that the decay of \u03b4n(x)\nin this case agrees with the predictions of our renormalization group analysis. For g < 1 we showed that the\ndensity oscillations at large distances decay faster than a\n2\npower law \u03b4n(x) \u221d 1/x(1\u2212g) ln x .\n\nWe found that the strongest manifestation of point\ndisorder on properties of a single columnar pin is the\nnonmonotonic dependence of the number of vortex lines\nprevented by the pin from tilting (Np ) on g in a weak\ntransverse magnetic field. In particular, for g \u2265 1, this\nnumber diverges at h \u2192 0 as a power law Np \u221d h\u03b7\u22123 ,\nprovided \u03b7 < 3. In finite systems this divergence is cut off\nby the system size and Np saturates Np (h = 0) \u221d L\u03b7\u22123 ,\nwhere L is the smallest of Lx and L\u03c4 . The only difference with the pure case is that \u03b7 gets renormalized by\npoint disorder \u03b7 > 2g. On the other hand if g < 1 then\narbitrarily weak point disorder leads to saturation of Np\nat h \u2192 0. As a result in large samples L \u2192 \u221e, Np (g)\nhas a maximum at g \u2217 = 1, while if L is finite then the\nmaximum occurs at some g \u2217 <\n\u223c 1.\n\n\f10\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to acknowledge helpful discussions with\nI.

The factor\nof 1/w in Eq. (A1) appears after averaging over the sample thickness. We are interested at the parameter regime\n \u0303 \u2248 \u2206/\u039b2 (see Sec. III) we get\nwhere g \u2248 1.

Following Ref. [8] we also assume that\nw \u2248 \u03bb. Then Eq. (A2) becomes\n \u0303 \u2248 10 \u03be/a.\n\u2206\n\n(A3)\n\nQuantitative predictions made throughout this paper re \u0303 \u226a 1. Alquire that point disorder is relatively weak: \u2206\nthough we expect that arbitrarily large disorder strength\nrenormalizes to zero for g > 1 and to small values\n \u0303 \u22c6 \u2248 1 \u2212 g for g < 1 (see Eq. (29)), it might be nec\u2206\n\u223c\nessary to go to large length scales in order to see this\n \u0303 \u226a1\neffect. From Eq. (A3) we see that the condition \u2206\nis easily satisfied for magnetic fields below Hc2 (we recall\nthat in superconducting films with vortices the in-plane\nmagnetic field H is related to the interline spacing a and\nthe film width w through H \u2248 \u03a60 /aw). On the other\n \u0303 0 should at least be comparahand, to be observable, \u2206\nble to |1 \u2212 g| (see, for example, Eq. (20)). If the system\nis tuned within 10% of the vortex glass transition, i.e.\n\n|1 \u2212 g| = 0.1, then effects of point disorder become relevant for a <\n\u223c 100 \u03be \u2248 200 nm. Such a separation between\nvortex lines is comparable with the magnetic penetration\nlength \u03bb and thus should be readily accessible at magnetic fields slightly above Hc1 .\nThe other quantity crucial to our analysis is the Luttinger parameter g. Interesting and nontrivial effects due\nto delicate competition between thermal fluctuations and\npoint disorder occur near the vortex glass transition corresponding to g = 1 (see, for example, Fig. 4). In Ref. [15]\nit was argued that g may have a nonmonotonic dependence on the vortex line density n0 = 1/a. In particular,\nat a \u226a \u03bb the Luttinger liquid parameter is very small\ng \u226a 1 and in the opposite limit a \u226b \u03bb we have g \u2192 1. It\nwas also argued in Ref. [15] that at least for some parameter values, increasing the vortex line density causes g to\nfirst increase and then decrease to zero. So one might expect that g crosses unity at some intermediate value of a\nof the order of \u03bb, i.e., around a few hundred nanometers\nin typical HTSC's. As we showed above, this is precisely\nwhat we need to achieve point disorder strength of the\norder of a few percent. Any necessary fine-tuning of g\n \u0303 can be achieved slightly varying temperature and\nand \u2206\nthe in-plane magnetic field, which determines a.\nAPPENDIX B: DENSITY OSCILLATIONS OF\nFREE FERMIONS IN THE PRESENCE OF\nPOINT DISORDER\n\nThe partition function of free fermions in a potential with point disorder (assuming for simplicity periodic\nboundary conditions in the timelike direction) is given by\nR L\u03c4 R\n\u2212\nd\u03c4 dxHf (x,\u03c4 )\nZ = Trh\u03a8|T\u03c4 e 0\n|\u03a8i,\n(B1)\n\nwhere Tr denotes the trace over all possible Slatter determinants |\u03a8i and Hf is the Hamiltonian (42) of the noninteracting fermions. A slightly different matrix element\nis required for vortices with free boundary conditions and\nfinite L\u03c4 . However, in the limit L\u03c4 \u2192 \u221e, this detail is\nirrelevant28 .\nIf the Hamiltonian were time independent, then in the\nzero temperature limit (where in the quantum language\ntemperature is equivalent to 1/L\u03c4 ) the only contribution to the N -particle partition function comes from the\nSlatter determinant of N eigenstates of Hf with lowest eigenenergies (\u03b5j ). Alternatively these are the states,\nwhich form the N highest eigenstates of the evolution\noperator\nR L\u03c4 R\n\u2212\nd\u03c4 dxHf (x,\u03c4 )\n.\n(B2)\nT = T\u03c4 e 0\n\nNote that, in a time-independent problem, nondegenerate eigenvalues \u03bbj of T become exponentially separated\nfrom each other with increasing L\u03c4 :\n\u03bbj\n\u221d eL\u03c4 (\u03b5j+1 \u2212\u03b5j ) .\n\u03bbj+1\n\n(B3)\n\n\f11\nTherefore, only the largest eigenvalues of the evolution\noperator need to be considered. We are interested here,\nhowever, in the case where the Hamiltonian explicitly\ndepends on time due to point disorder. In this case\none can not use eigenstates of Hf , because they also depend on time. However, it is still possible to define the\nspectrum of the evolution operator for a given L\u03c4 . It\nseems reasonable to assume that even in the presence of\npoint disorder the separation between the eigenvalues of\nT grows exponentially with L\u03c4 .30 This statement can be\nchecked numerically (see Fig. 5). Therefore, in the limit\nL\u03c4 \u2192 \u221e the partition function (44) is dominated the\n\"ground state\" |\u03a8i = |Gi of the evolution operator, i.e.,\nby the Slatter determinant of the N highest eigenstates\ngi (x) of T :\n|Gi = det gi (xj ).\n\n(B4)\n\nHere i, j = 1, . . . , N enumerate different single particle\nlevels and coordinates. Figure 5 corresponds to relatively\nstrong point disorder and it is necessary to have large\nsample sizes to assure the ground-state dominance. For\nweaker disorder it will suffice to have smaller L\u03c4 to find\nthe exponential separation of \u03bbj .\n\n.\n\nIn order to obtain |Gi numerically we discretize the\nsystem both in space and time directions. In particular,\ninstead of the Hamiltonian given by Eq. (42) we use\n\nHf (\u03c4 ) =\n\nUj (\u03c4k )Ui (\u03c4p ) = \u22060 \u03b4ji \u03b4kp ,\n\n\u03bbk\n\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\nL\u03c4\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\nFIG. 5: Seven largest eigenvalues of the evolution operator T\nas a function of the sample size L\u03c4 . The parameters used in\nthis figure are Lx = 101, \u22060 \u2248 0.008, V0 = 0.02, J = 0.1 (see\nEq. (B5)). For a pure system (\u22060 = 0), the largest eigenvalue\ncorresponding to a bound state is followed by three degenerate\npairs of smaller ones. Point disorder slightly lifts degeneracy\nbetween the states, but clearly does not affect exponential\ngrowth of the separation between the pairs of eigenvalues with\nL\u03c4 .\n\nG. Blatter, M.V.

Of course, the\ntime step \u03b4\u03c4 can ultimately be taken to be 1 by an appropriate scaling of the couplings J, U, and V . In a single\nparticle space both the Hamiltonian Hf and the evolution operator T are M \u00d7 M matrices.
