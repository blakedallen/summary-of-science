In this analysis, three main steps are present. In the\nfirst step, one constructs simple waves w((\u03bd * x \u2212 \u03c3t)/\u03b5), or \"profiles\", which\nare exact solutions of the viscous equation, with viscosity of order \u03b5. This\namounts to solving an ordinary differential equation (the profile equation);\nthe solutions describe the fast transition between the hyperbolic solution and\nthe parabolic boundary conditions (boundary layers) or between two smooth\nhyperbolic solutions (shock layers). Next, given a profile, formal plane wave\nor spectral analysis yields necessary stability conditions in terms of Evans\nfunctions. The second step is to compute explicitly this function on specific\nexamples and check the stability conditions. The third step is to prove the\nlinear and nonlinear stability of solutions, assuming that the suitable EvansLopatinski condition is satisfied, in particular for curved fronts or boundaries\nand non-piecewise constant hyperbolic solutions. This paper deals with the\nthird step, with specific applications to magneto-hydrodynamics. The first\nand second steps are discussed for shock and boundary layers, respectively,\nin companion papers [GMWZ6] and [GMWZ5].\nWe concentrate on the construction of symmetrizers for the linearized\nequations, and more specifically in the so called low-frequency regime, as\nthey are the key point in the proof of stability estimates which eventually yield short-time existence and nonlinear stability theorems; see [Maj1]\n[Maj2] for hyperbolic shocks and [M\u00e9Zu1, GMWZ2, GMWZ3, GMWZ4] for\nviscous perturbations. In these papers, it is proved that strong stability\nestimates hold, under the natural uniform Lopatinski condition, or Evans'\ncondition, provided that the equations satisfy a structural condition, called\nthe block structure condition (see [Maj1, MaOs] in the hyperbolic case and\n[M\u00e9Zu1] for the viscous case). This condition is in some sense necessary for\nthe construction of Kreiss' symmetrizers which are used to prove the stability estimates. It is satisfied in the case of inviscid Euler's equations of gas\ndynamics ([Maj1]), but does not hold in other interesting examples such as\nthe equations of magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD). So there is a real need for\nan extension of the analysis beyond the class of systems satisfying the block\nstructure condition. This is done in [M\u00e9Zu2] for hyperbolic systems and the\nmain goal of this paper is to extend the analysis to viscous systems, in view\nof applications to MHD.\nWe carry out in passing several other useful generalizations of the basic\nboundary-layer analyisis of [M\u00e9Zu1, M\u00e93], extending the theory to \"real\" or\n3\n\n\fpartially parabolic viscosities, Neumann or mixed-type parabolic boundary\nconditions, and systems with nonconservative form. In addition, we prove\na more fundamental version of the Zumbrun\u2013Serre\u2013Rousset theorem, valid\nfor variable multiplicities, characterizing the limiting hyperbolic system and\nboundary conditions as a nonsingular limit of a reduced viscous system as\nfrequency goes to zero. Extensions to the shock case are given in [GMWZ6].\nConsider boundary value problems for hyperbolic systems\n(1.1)\n\n\u2202t u +\n\nd\nX\n\nAj \u2202j u\n\nj=1\n\non {xd \u2265 0} with boundary conditions on {xd = 0} which is assumed to\nbe noncharacteristic. The plane wave analysis of such system leads to consider ordinary differential system in z \u2265 0, depending on Fourier-Laplace\nfrequencies \u03b6 = (\u03c4, \u03b7, \u03b3), with \u03b3 > 0,\n(1.2)\n\n\u2202z \u2212 H0 (\u03b6),\n\nd\u22121\n\u0011\n\u0010\nX\n\u03b7\nA\n(i\u03c4\n+\n\u03b3)\n+\nH0 (\u03b6) := \u2212A\u22121\nj j\nd\nj=1\n\nViscous perturbations of (1.1) are systems of the form\n(1.3)\n\n\u2202t u +\n\nd\nX\nj=1\n\nAj \u2202j u \u2212 \u03b5\n\nd\nX\n\nj,k=1\n\n\u0001\n\u2202j Bj,k \u2202k u\n\nwith natural structural conditions which are recalled below. The low-frequency\nplane wave analysis of such systems lead to consider perturbations of (1.2):\n(1.4)\n\n\u2202z \u2212 H(\u03b6, \u03c1)),\n\nH(\u03b6, \u03c1) := H0 (\u03b6) + \u03c1H1 (\u03b6, \u03c1)\n\ndepending smoothly on an additional parameter \u03c1 \u2265 0 (see section 2 below\nor [M\u00e9Zu1, Zum1, M\u00e93]).\nIn this paper, our main concern is the construction of symmetrizers\n\u03a3(\u03b6, \u03c1) for (1.4). The precise conditions we impose on \u03a3 are given in Section\n3. In particular, we focus on smooth symmetrizers, as they serve as symbols\nfor pseudodifferential symmetrizers in the variable coefficient analysis.\nWhen \u03c1 = 0, \u03a30 (\u03b6) = \u03a3(\u03b6, 0) is a symmetrizer for H0 (\u03b6). Such symmetrizers were constructed first for strictly hyperbolic systems (1.1) by\nKreiss ([Kre]) (see also [ChPi]). Strict hyperbolicity is used at only one\nplace: it implies that H0 can be put in a normal form, which is called block\n4\n\n\fstructure in [Maj1, MaOs]. Therefore Kreiss' construction of symmetrizers\nextends immediately to systems which satisfy this block structure condition.\nIn [M\u00e9Zu2], it isPproved that this condition is satisfied if and only if the\nsymbol A(\u03be) := \u03bej Aj of (1.1) is smoothly diagonalizable for \u03be 6= 0, recovering known examples such as Euler's equation of gas dynamics or Maxwell's\nequations. The second important result in [M\u00e9Zu2] it that the construction\nof symmetrizers is extended to a class of symmetric systems which are not\nsmoothly diagonalizable for all \u03be 6= 0: we demand that the \"bad\" multiple\nmodes are totally incoming or totally outgoing (see the Definitions 4.1 and\n4.3 below), and this applies to inviscid MHD.\nIn the small viscosity case, the construction of symmetrizers is performed\nin [M\u00e9Zu1], with application to the analysis of shocks in [GMWZ1, GMWZ2,\nGMWZ3, GMWZ4], assuming that the eigenvalues of A(\u03be) have constant\nmultiplicity for \u03be 6= 0. As mentioned above, this assumption rules out the\ncase of MHD.\nThe main objective of this paper is to start the analysis of (1.3) or (1.4)\nwhen the constant multiplicity assumption is relaxed and in particular to\ninvestigate the construction of symmetrizers. It turns out that the influence\nof the viscosity is much more subtle than expected near multiple modes. In\nsome cases, it may induce destabilizing effects. Let us list several new phenomena which can occur when there are multiple modes with nonconstant\nmultiplicity.\n\u2022 Smooth diagonalization of A0 (\u03be) implies a smooth block reduction for\nH0 (\u03b6). The perturbation \u03c1H1 in general couples the different blocks associated to a multiple eigenvalues (and this occurs for MHD). If the crossing\neigenvalues do not have the same behavior with respect to the boundary\n(typically if they are not all incoming nor all outgoing), the spectral negative space E\u2212 (\u03b6, \u03c1) is not continuous (in general) at \u03c1 = 0. This happens\nfor slow shock waves in MHD. This phenomena is excluded when the eigenvalues have constant multiplicities; see [M\u00e9Zu3] (in this case, since crossing eigenvalues are equal, they have the same behavior with respect to the\nboundary). Recall from [M\u00e9Zu2] that the continuity of E\u2212 is a necessary\ncondition for Kreiss' construction of smooth symmetrizers, more precisely\nfor the existence of what is called below, smooth K-families of symmetrizers.\nIn any case, the discontinuity of E\u2212 is a major difficulty in the construction\nof symmetrizers.\n\u2022 As a consequence of the previous phenomenon, the Evans function\ncan be discontinuous at \u03c1 = 0. In the shock problem, the usual Evans\nfunction is in every case singular at \u03c1 = 0 (see [ZuSe]), but the remark\napplies to the modified (or desingularized) Evans function introduced in\n5\n\n\f[GMWZ3, GMWZ4] (see below).\n\u2022 Because of the lack of continuity of the Evans function, it may happen\nthat the strong Lopatinsky stability condition for the hyperbolic problem (at\n\u03c1 = 0) does not imply the strong Evans stability condition for small \u03c1. This is\nin sharp contrast with the known results obtained in the constant multiplicty\ncase ([ZuSe, Zum1, Rou, M\u00e9Zu1, GMWZ3, GMWZ4]). This is illustrated\nby an example in Section 7 and this can occur for MHD, for some ad hoc\nboundary condition. An interesting question is to know whether this can\nhappen or not for physical boundary conditions, in particular for slow MHD\nshocks.\nOn the other hand, we prove in this paper the existence of smooth symmetrizers under a natural generalized block structure condition for (1.4). We\nalso provide a geometrical characterization of this condition on the matrices\nA and B occurring in (1.3). Moreover, modes that are totally incoming or\ntotally outgoing do not cause trouble in the analysis of E\u2212 nor of the Evans\nfunction. They are easily handled in the case of symmetric systems as in\n[M\u00e9Zu2]. For instance, an important outcome of the present paper is the\nfollowing result. We refer to the next sections for precise definitions.\nTheorem 1.1. Suppose that the full system (1.3) is symmetric. Suppose\nin addition that the eigenvalues of the hyperbolic system (1.1) are either\nsemi-simple with constant multiplicity or totally nonglancing in the sense of\nDefinition 4.3. Then, there are K-families of symmetrizers for the associated\nreduced system (1.4), for \u03c1 \u2265 0 sufficiently small.\nAs recalled in the next section, K-families of symmetrizers provide Kreiss\nsymmetrizers for boundary value problems which satisfy a uniform Lopatinski stability condition. One important application and motivation is the\nfollowing\nExample 1.2. Fast Lax' shocks for MHD satisfy the assumptions of Theorem 1.1.\nBut we also have the following\nCounter example 1.3. Slow Lax' shocks for MHD do not satisfy the assumptions of Theorem 1.1.\nRemark 1.4. Fast shocks with small magnetic field are perturbations of\nacoustic shocks of gas dynamics, whose stability has been studied by A.Majda\n([Maj1]). Therefore, there are good reasons to think that the uniform EvansLopatinski condition is satisfied for Fast Lax' shocks for MHD, at least for\nperfect gases state laws and small magnetic field.\n6\n\n\fRemark 1.5. When the assumptions of Theorem 1.1 are not satisfied, or\nmore generally when the generalized block structure fails, one could try to\nconstruct nonsmooth symmetrizers as in [M\u00e9Zu2]. The counterexample 1.3\nwould be a good motivation for that. However, nonsmooth symmetrizer\nwould require much more sophisticated pseudodifferential tools to handle\nvariable coefficients. Moreover, slow shocks are not so closely related to\nacoustic shocks, and it is not known whether the uniform Lopatinski condition is likely to be satisfied or not.\nWhen all the eigenvalues have constant multiplicity, Theorem 1.1 is\nproved in [M\u00e9Zu1] (see also [M\u00e93]).1 The construction is based on a reduction of (1.4) to a suitable block diagonal form. Blocks which correspond\nto totally nonglancing modes (incoming or outgoing) are treated using the\nsymmetry of the system as in [M\u00e9Zu2]. For other blocks, we discuss in detail\nin Section 4 the generalized block structure condition which is needed for the\nconstruction of Kreiss symmetrizers.\nThe symmetrizers are used in [M\u00e9Zu1, GMWZ1, GMWZ2, GMWZ3,\nGMWZ4] to prove maximal stability estimates for boundary value problems.\nThe Fourier multipliers \u03a3(p, \u03b6) serve as symbols for pseudo-differential symmetrizers. All the other steps in these papers, linearization, paralinearization, separation of frequencies, the high- and medium-frequency analysis, the\nconversion of the plane wave or symbolic calculus into an operator calculus\nvia the use of a paradifferential calculus, are independent of the constant\nmultiplicity assumption which was assumed there as a sufficient condition\nfor the generalized block structure condition. Therefore, all these analyses\nare valid under the assumptions of Theorem 3.7.\nAs already mentioned, the main novelty of this paper with respect to\nprevious works of the authors is the consideration of systems with variable\nmultiplicity. To lighten the presentation, we will now we focus on boundary layers for noncharacteristic boundary value problems. The extension\nto classical, conservative Lax-type shocks requires only to incorporate the\nideas already explained in detail in (for instance) [GMWZ3, GMWZ4]. (The\ntreatment of nonconservative and or undercompressive shocks involves new\nissues, and is carried out in [GMWZ6].) Similarly, we will concentrate only\non the symbolic analysis for constant-coeffient equations and the construction of smooth Fourier-Laplace multipliers. The passage from these multipliers to linear and nonlinear stability estimates for variable coefficients is\n1\n\nThe reduction to (1.4) is carried out for strictly parabolic viscosities in [M\u00e9Zu1, M\u00e93]\nand for partial viscosities in [GMWZ4]. However, the form of H1 is the same in each case\n(a consequence of Kawashima's genuine coupling condition, Assumption (H4) below).\n\n7\n\n\falready performed in previous works (see [M\u00e9Zu1, GMWZ3, GMWZ4]) and\ncan be used as an independent black box.\n\n2\n\nSpectral stability\n\nIn this section, we recall the main steps of the spectral stability analysis of\nnoncharacteristic boundary layers, refereeing to [Gue, GrGu, M\u00e9Zu1, M\u00e93,\nZum1, Zu2, GMWZ3, GMWZ4] for details and further references and applications to the similar analysis of shock profiles. In particular, we give a new\nproof of the Zumbrun-Serre Lemma ([ZuSe, Rou]) which allows for variable\nmultiplicities. Moreover, not only does it provide a comparison between the\nEvans function of the viscous equation and the Lopatinski determinant of\nthe inviscid system, but it also shows the link between the equations themselves: for low frequencies, the viscous boundary value problem decouples\ninto two boundary value problems, one of them being a nonsingular perturbation of the limiting hyperbolic boundary value problem. We will also\nrecall from [GMWZ4] the main arguments for the high-frequency regime.\n\n2.1\n\nStructural assumptions\n\nConsider a system of equations\n(2.1)\n\nL\u03b5 (u) := A0 (u)\u2202t u +\n\nd\nX\nj=1\n\nAj (u)\u2202j u \u2212 \u03b5\n\nd\nX\n\nj,k=1\n\n\u0001\n\u2202j Bj,k (u)\u2202k u = 0.\n\nWhen \u03b5 = 0, L0 is first order and assumed to hyperbolic; \u03b5 plays the role\nof a non-dimensional viscosity and for \u03b5 > 0, the system is assumed to\nbe parabolic or at least partially parabolic. Classical examples are the\nNavier-Stokes equations of gas dynamics, or the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD).\nThe form of the equations is preserved under a change of unknowns\nu = \u03a6(\u0169) or multiplication on the left by a constant invertible matrix. To\ncover the case of partial viscosity and motivated by the examples of NavierStokes equations and MHD, we make the following assumption:\nAssumption 2.1. (H0) The matrices Aj and Bj,k are C \u221e N \u00d7 N real\nmatrices of the variable u \u2208 U \u2217 \u2282 RN . Moreover, for all u \u2208 U \u2217 , the matrix\nA0 (u) is invertible.\n(H1) Possibly after a change of variables u and multiplying the system on\nthe left by an invertible constant-coefficient matrix, there is N \u2032 \u2208 {1, . . . , N }\n8\n\n\f\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nand there are coordinates u = (u1 , u2 ) \u2208 RN \u2212N \u00d7 RN and f = (f 1 , f 2 ) \u2208\n\u2032\n\u2032\nRN \u2212N \u00d7 RN such that the following block structure condition is satisfied :\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012 11\n0 0\n0\nA0\n\u2032\n, Bjk (u) =\n(2.2)\nA0 (u) := f0 (u) =\n22 ,\n0 Bjk\nA22\nA21\n0\n0\nWe refer to [GMWZ4] or [Zu2] for further comments and explanations.\nFrom now on we work with variables u = (u1 , u2 ) \u2208 U \u2217 such that (2.2) holds.\nWe set\n(2.3)\n\nAj = fj\u2032 ,\n\nAj = A\u22121\n0 Aj ,\n\nB j,k = A\u22121\n0 Bj,k ,\n\nand systematically use the notation M \u03b1\u03b2 for the sub-blocks of a matrix M\ncorresponding to the splitting u = (u1 , u2 ). Note that\n!\n0\n0\n\u22121\n(2.4)\nB j,k (u) := A0 (u) Bjk (u) =\n.\n22\n0 B jk (u)\nThe triangular form of the equations also reveals the importance of the (1, 1)\nblock which plays a special role in the analysis :\n(2.5)\n\nL11 (u, \u2202) =\n\nd\nX\n\nA11\nj (u)\u2202j ,\n\nor\n\nj=0\n\n\u0001\u22121 11\n11\nL (u, \u2202).\nL (u, \u2202) = A11\n0 (u)\n\nIn this spirit, the high-frequency principal part of the equation is\n( 11\nL (u, \u2202)u1\n(2.6)\n22\n\u2202t u2 \u2212 \u03b5B (u, \u2202)u2\nP\n22\n2,2\nwith B (u, \u03be) = dj,k=1 \u03bej \u03bek B j,k (u). We refer to Lemma 7.3 for a more\ndetailed account of this notion of principal part. The first natural hypothesis\n22\nis that L11 (u, \u2202) is hyperbolic and \u2202t \u2212 B (u, \u2202) is parabolic in the direction\ndt.\nAssumption 2.2. (H2) There is c > 0 such that for all u \u2208 U \u2217 and \u03be \u2208 Rd ,\n22\nthe eigenvalues of B (u, \u03be) satisfy Re \u03bc \u2265 c|\u03be|2 .\nP\n11\n(H3) For all u \u2208 U \u2217 and all \u03be \u2208 Rd \\{0}, A (u, \u03be) = dj=1 \u03bej \u010011\nj (u) has\nonly real eigenvalues.\nFor the applications we have in mind such as Navier-Stokes and MHD,\n11\nthe operator L is a transport field and (H3) is trivially satisfied.\n9\n\n\fNext we assume that the inviscid equations are hyperbolic and that\nKawashima' s genuine coupling condition is satisfied for u, in some open\nsubdomain U \u2282 U \u2217 . Let\n(2.7)\n\nA(u, \u03be) =\n\nd\nX\n\n\u03bej Aj (u)\n\nand\n\nB(u, \u03be) =\n\nj=1\n\nd\nX\n\n\u03bej \u03bek B j,k (u).\n\nj,k=1\n\nAssumption 2.3. (H4) There is c > 0 such that for u \u2208 U and \u03be \u2208 Rd , the\neigenvalues of iA(u, \u03be) + B(u, \u03be) satisfy\n(2.8)\n\nRe \u03bc \u2265 c\n\n|\u03be|2\n.\n1 + |\u03be|2\n\nRemark 2.4. (H4) implies hyperbolicity of the inviscid equation: for all\nu \u2208 U and \u03be \u2208 Rd \\{0} the eigenvalues of A(u, \u03be) are real. The set U may\nbe thought of as the \"hyperbolic set\" where interior, inviscid solutions are\nbe constructed, and the larger U \u2217 as the \"hyperbolic\u2013parabolic\" set where\nexterior, boundary layer solutions are to be constructed, matching U to\nboundary values in a multi-scale expansion. In contrast with [GMWZ4] and\n[Zu2], we do not assume here that the eigenvalues of A have constant multiplicity. It is precisely the aim of this paper to substitute weaker conditions,\nallowing us to treat the case of MHD.\nSymmetric systems play an important role, and symmetry will be an\nimportant assumption in some of our results. In particular, the Assumption (H4) is satisfied when the following conditions are satisfied (see [Kaw,\nKaS2]):\nDefinition 2.5. The system (2.1) is said to be symmetric dissipative if there\nexists a real matrix S(u), which depends smoothly on u \u2208 U , such that for all\nu \u2208 U and all \u03be \u2208 Rd \\{0}, the matrix S(u)A0 (u) is symmetric definite positive, S(u)A(u, \u03be) is symmetric and the symmetric matrix Re S(u)B(u, xi)\nis non negative with kernel of dimension N \u2212 N \u2032 .\nWe consider a boundary value problem for (2.1) and the model case of a\nhalf space, which is given by {x > 0}, in some coordinates (y1 , . . . , yd\u22121 , x)\nfor the space variables. We assume that the boundary is not characteristic\nboth for the viscous and the inviscid equations. The principal term of the\nviscous equation is block diagonal as indicated in (2.6) The B 22 block is\nnoncharacteristic by (H2). Restricting U \u2217 to a component where the profiles\n11\nwill take their values, the condition for the A block reads\n10\n\n\fAssumption 2.6. U \u2217 is connected and for all u \u2208 U \u2217 , det A11\nd (u) 6= 0.\nFor the inviscid equation, restricting U to the component where the\nhyperbolic solutions will take their value, the condition reads\n\u0001\nAssumption 2.7. U is connected and for all u \u2208 U , det Ad (u) 6= 0.\n11\n\nBy Assumption (H3) and Remark 2.4, Ad (u) and Ad (u) have only real\neigenvalues, which by Assumptions 2.7 and 2.6 never vanish. This leads to\ntwo important indices :\n\nNotations 2.8. With assumptions as above, N+ denotes the number of\npositive eigenvalues of Ad (u) for u \u2208 U and N+1 the number of positive\n11\neigenvalues of Ad (u) for u \u2208 U \u2217 . We also set Nb = N \u2032 + N+1 .\nThe block structure (2.6) suggests that Nb is the correct number of\nboundary conditions for the well posedness of (2.1), for solutions with values\nin U \u2217 . Indeed, the high-frequency decoupling (2.6) suggests N \u2032 boundary\nconditions for u2 and N+1 boundary conditions for u1 . On the other hand,\nN+ is the correct number of boundary conditions for the inviscid equation\nfor solutions with values in U . Thus we supplement (2.1) with boundary\nconditions\n(2.9)\n\n\u03a5(u, \u03b5\u2202y u2 , \u03b5\u2202x u2 )|x=0 = 0.\n\nWithout pretending to maximal generality, we assume that they decouple\ninto zero-order boundary conditions for u1 and zero-order and first-order\nconditions for u2 :\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 \u03a51 (u1 )|x=0 = 0,\n(2.10)\n\u03a52 (u2 )|x=0 = 0,\n\uf8f3\n\u03a53 (u, \u03b5\u2202y u2 , \u03b5\u2202x u2 )|x=0 = 0.\nwith\n\n\u03a53 (u, \u2202y u2 , \u2202x u2 ) = Kd \u2202x u2 +\n\nd\u22121\nX\n\nKj (u)\u2202j u2 .\n\nj=1\n\nAssumption 2.9. \u03a51 , \u03a52 and \u03a53 are smooth functions of their argu1\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nments with values in RN+ , RN \u2212N and RN respectively, where N \u2032\u2032 \u2208\n{0, 1, . . . , N \u2032 }. Moreover, Kd has maximal rank N \u2032\u2032 and for all u \u2208 U \u2217 the\nJacobian matrices \u03a5\u20321 (u1 ) and \u03a5\u20322 (u2 ) have maximal rank N+1 and N \u2032 \u2212 N \u2032\u2032\nrespectively.\n11\n\n\f2.2\n\nProfiles and inviscid boundary conditions\n\nTo match constant solutions u of the inviscid problem to solutions satisfying\nthe boundary conditions, one looks for exact solutions of (2.1) (2.9) of the\nform:\n\u0010x\u0011\n(2.11)\nu\u03b5 (t, y, x) = w\n,\n\u03b5\nsuch that\n(2.12)\n\nlim w(z) = u .\n\nz\u2192+\u221e\n\nThe equation for w reads\n(\n\u0001\nAd (w)\u2202z w \u2212 \u2202z Bd,d (w)\u2202z w = 0,\n(2.13)\n\u03a5(w, 0, \u2202z w2 )|z=0 = 0.\n\nz \u2265 0,\n\nSolutions are called layer profiles. This equation can be written as a first\norder system for U = (w, \u2202z w2 ), which is nonsingular if and only if A11\nd is\ninvertible (this indicates the strong link between Assumption 2.6 and the\nansatz (2.11)):\n\n(2.14)\n\n\u22121 12 3\n\u2202z w1 = \u2212(A11\nd ) Ad w ,\n\n\u2202z w2 = w3 ,\n\n\u0001 3\n11 \u22121 12\n21\n\u2202z Bd,d w3 ) = A22\nd \u2212 Ad (Ad ) Ad w ,\n\nand the matrices are evaluated at w = (w1 , w2 ).\nThe natural limiting boundary conditions for the inviscid problem read\n(2.15)\n\nu|x=0 \u2208 C,\n\nwhere C denotes the set of end points u such that there is a layer profile\nw \u2208 C \u221e (R+ ; U \u2217 ) satisfying (2.12) (2.13). The properties of the set C as well\nas the stability analysis of (2.13) depend on the spectral properties of the\nlinearized equations from (2.13) near w(z). In particular we will discuss the\nnotion of transversality for the profile w (see [M\u00e9Zu1, M\u00e93]). However, to\navoid repetitions and prepare the multidimensional stability analysis, we enlarge the framework and consider the multidimensional linearized equations\nfrom the full system (2.1) near solutions (2.11).\nFor further use, it is convenient to enlarge the class of functions w:\nconsider a function C \u221e (R+ ; U \u2217 ) which converges at an exponential rate to\nand end state u \u2208 U : there is \u03b4 > 0 such that for all k \u2208 N\n(2.16)\n\ne\u03b4z \u2202zk (w(z) \u2212 u) \u2208 L\u221e (R+ ).\n12\n\n\fWe refer to such a function as a profile; it need not be a solution of (2.13),\nthough it will be in applications. Note that solutions of (2.13) (2.12) satisfy\nthe exponential convergence above.\nConsider the linearized equations from (2.1) (2.9) around u\u03b5 = w(x/\u03b5):\n(2.17)\n\nL\u2032u\u03b5 u\u0307 = f \u0307,\n\n\u03a5\u2032 (u\u0307, \u03b5\u2202y u\u0307, \u03b5\u2202x u\u0307)|x=0 = \u0121.\n\nHere \u03a5\u2032 is the differential of \u03a5 at (w(0), 0, \u2202z w(0)). L\u2032u\u03b5 is a differential\noperator with coefficients that are smooth functions of z := x/\u03b5. Factoring\nout \u03b5\u22121 it also appears as an operator in \u03b5\u2202t , \u03b5\u2202y , \u03b5\u2202x :\n(2.18)\n\nL\u2032u\u03b5 =\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010x\nL , \u03b5\u2202t , \u03b5\u2202y , \u03b5\u2202x .\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\n\nIt has constant coefficients in (t, y), and following the usual theory of constantcoefficient evolution equations, one performs a Laplace-Fourier transform in\n(t, y), with frequency variables denoted by \u03b3\u0303 + i\u03c4\u0303 and \u03b7\u0303 respectively, yielding\nthe systems\n\u0011\n1 \u0010x\nL , \u03b5(\u03b3\u0303 + i\u03c4\u0303 ), i\u03b5\u03b7\u0303, \u03b5\u2202x .\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\nNext, we introduce explicitly the fast variable z = x/\u03b5, rescale the frequency\nvariables as \u03b6 = (\u03c4, \u03b7, \u03b3) = \u03b5(\u03c4\u0303 , \u03b7\u0303, \u03b3\u0303), and multiply the equation by \u03b5, revealing the equation\n(2.19)\n\n(2.20)\n\nL(z, \u03b3 + i\u03c4, i\u03b7, \u2202z )u = f,\n\n\u03a5\u2032 (u, i\u03b7u, \u2202z u)|z=0 = g,\n\nL = \u2212B(z)\u2202z2 + A(z, \u03b6)\u2202z + M(z, \u03b6),\n\nwith in particular, B(z) = Bd,d (w(z)) and A11 (z, \u03b6) = A11\nd (w(z)). We do not\ngive here the explicit form of A and M. Using (H2) and Assumption 2.2,\nthe equation is written as a first order system\n(2.21)\n\n\u2202z U = G(z, \u03b6)U + F,\n\n\u0393(\u03b6)U|z=0 = g,\n\nwhere\n(2.22)\n\n(2.23)\n\n\u2032\n\nU = t (u, \u2202z u2 ) = (u1 , u2 , \u2202z u2 ) \u2208 CN +N ,\n\u0001\nF = (A11 (z))\u22121 f 1 , 0, (B 22 (z))\u22121 (\u2212f 2 + A21 (z)(A11 (z))\u22121 f 1 ) .\n13\n\n\fThe analysis of this equation depends on the size of the frequencies\n\u03b6. When \u03b6 is large, the character of the equations is dominated by the\nhigh-frequency principal part (2.6), and we use a slowly-varying-coefficients\nanalysis (related to the \"tracking lemmas\" of [Zum1, Zu2]) based on the\nrelatively slow rate of change of coefficients compared to the size of the frequency; see [GMWZ3, GMWZ4] and Section 7 below. For small or bounded\nfrequencies \u03b6, we use the conjugation lemma of [M\u00e9Zu1]. The condition\n(2.16) implies that there is \u03b4 > 0 and an end state matrix G(u, \u03b6), depending on the endstate u of w, such that\n(2.24)\n\n\u2202zk (G(z, \u03b6) \u2212 G(u, \u03b6)) = O(e\u2212\u03b4z ).\n\nLemma 2.10. Given \u03b6 \u2208 Rd+1 , there is a smooth invertible matrix \u03a6(z, \u03b6)\nfor z \u2208 R+ and \u03b6 in a neighborhood of \u03b6, such that (2.19) is equivalent to\n(2.25)\n\n\u2202z \u0168 = G(u, \u03b6)\u0168 + F\u0303 ,\n\n\u0393\u0303(\u03b6)\u0168|z=0 = g.\n\nwith U = \u03a6(z, \u03b6)\u0168 , F = \u03a6(z, \u03b6)F\u0303 and \u0393\u0303(\u03b6) = \u0393(\u03b6)\u03a6(0, \u03b6). In addition, \u03a6\nand \u03a6\u22121 converge the identity matrix at an exponential rate when z \u2192 \u221e.\nMoreover, if the coefficients of the operator and w depend smoothly on\nextra parameters p (such as the end state u), then \u03a6 can also be chosen to\ndepend smoothly on p, on a neighborhood of a given p.\nRemark 2.11. The linearized profile equations from (2.13) around w, are\nexactly (2.19) at the frequency \u03b6 = 0. In particular, Lemma 2.10 implies\nthat these equations are conjugated to constant-coefficient equations, via\nthe conjugation by \u03a6(*, 0).\nNext we investigate the spectral properties of the matrix G.

That\nthis number is equal to Nb = N+1 +N \u2032 is a consequence of the high-frequency\nanalysis in Lemma 7.3 below (see also Lemma 1.7 in [Zu2]).\niii) Because M\u0303 (u, 0) = 0 and \u00c3(u, 0) = Ad (u), there holds\n\u0012\n\u0013\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n)\u22121 A12\n\u2212(A11\nd\nd\n0\n\uf8f8\n(2.31)\nG(u, 0) = \uf8ed N \u00d7N\nIdN \u2032 \u00d7N \u2032\n0N \u2032 \u00d7N\nP0 (u)\n\nSince P0 is invertible, G can be smoothly conjugated to a block diagonal\nmatrix as in (2.28), with V satisfying (2.30) and H(u, 0) = 0.

This implies that\n\u00d1 = N+ + N\u22122 .\nSimilarly, one considers the linearized equations from the inviscid hyperbolic problem L0 (u) = 0 around the constant solution u:\nL\u20320,u u\u0307 = f \u0307.\n\n(2.33)\n\nAfter performing a Laplace-Fourier transform, this equation reads\n(2.34)\n\nL0 (u, \u03b3 + i\u03c4, i\u03b7, \u2202x )u = f\n\nor, with H0 defined at (2.27),\n(2.35)\n\n\u2202x u = H0 (u, \u03b6)u + A\u22121\nd (u)f.\n\nAn important property for profiles is the notion of transversality (see\n[M\u00e9Zu1] or [M\u00e93] for the case of total viscosity). It concerns the linearized\nequations from (2.11) around w. As mentioned in Remark 2.11, they correspond exactly to the first order system (2.19) with \u03b6 = 0. We abbreviate\nthe homogeneous problem as\n(\nL(z, 0, \u2202z )\u1e87 = 0,\nz \u2265 0,\n(2.36)\n\u2032\n2\n\u03a5 (\u1e87, 0, \u2202z \u1e87 )|z=0 = 0.\n16\n\n\fA corollary of Lemmas 2.10 and 2.12 is that the solutions of the homogeneous\nequation L(z, 0, \u2202z )\u1e87 = 0 form a space of dimension N + N \u2032 , parametrized\n\u2032\nby (uH , uP ) \u2208 CN \u00d7 CN :\n(2.37)\n\n\u1e87(z) = \u03a6H (z)uH + \u03a6P (z)ezP0 (u) uP\n\nwhere the matrices \u03a6H (z) and \u03a6P (z) are smooth and bounded on R+ and\n\u03a6H (z) \u2192 Id as z \u2192 Id. The solution is bounded if and only if uP belongs to\nthe negative space E\u2212 (P0 (u)) of P0 (u), that is the invariant space of P0 (u)\nassociated to the spectrum lying in {Re \u03bc < 0}; thus the space S of bounded\nsolutions has dimension N + N\u22122 . The space of solutions that tend to zero at\ninfinity, denoted by S0 , has dimension N\u22122 , corresponding to the conditions\nuH = 0 and uP \u2208 E\u2212 (P0 (u)).\nThe boundary conditions in (2.36) read\n(2.38)\n\n\u0393H uH + \u0393P uP := \u0393(\u1e87, \u2202z \u1e872 )|z=0 = 0.\n\nDefinition 2.13. The profile w is said to be transversal if\ni) there is no nontrivial solution \u1e87 \u2208 S0 which satisfies the boundary\nconditions \u0393(\u1e87, \u2202z \u1e872 )|z=0 = 0,\nii) the mapping \u1e87 7\u2192 \u0393(\u1e87, \u2202z \u1e872 )|z=0 from S to CNb has rank Nb .\nEquivalently, it means that ker \u0393P \u2229 E\u2212 (P0 (u)) = {0} and that the rank\nof the matrix (\u0393H , \u0393P ) from CN \u00d7 E\u2212 (P0 (u)) to CNb is Nb .\nIf the profile satisfies condition i), there is a decomposition\n(2.39)\n\nC Nb = F H \u2295 F P ,\n\nFP := \u0393P E\u2212 (P0 (u))\n\nwith dim FH = N+ and dim F0,P = N\u22122 . Denote by \u03c0H and \u03c0P the projections associated to this splitting.\nFor \u1e87 \u2208 S given by (2.37), one can eliminate uP from the boundary\nconditions (2.38) and write them\n(2.40)\n\n\u0393red uH = 0,\n\nuP = R0,P uH ,\n\nwith\n(2.41)\n\n\u0393red := \u03c0H \u0393H ,\n\nR0,P := \u2212(\u0393P )\u22121 \u03c0P \u0393H\n\nand (\u0393P )\u22121 is the inverse of the mapping \u0393P from E\u2212 (P0 (u)) to F0,P .\nWith these notations, ii) means that \u0393red has rank N+ .

When w is a layer profile, solution of (2.13), the transversality condition implies that near the end point u, the set C in (2.15) which\ndescribes the limiting hyperbolic conditions is a smooth manifold of dimension N\u2212 = N \u2212 N+ and ker \u0393red is the tangent space to C at u. Therefore,\nthe natural boundary condition for the linearized hyperbolic equation, and\nin particular for (2.33), are\n\u0393red u = h.\n\n(2.42)\n\n2.3\n\nEvans functions and Lopatinski determinant\nd+1\n\nFor a given \u03b6 \u2208 R+ \\{0}, we now investigate the well-posedness of equation\n(2.19) or equivalently (2.21) or (2.25). Introduce the space E\u2212 (\u03b6) of initial\nconditions (u(0), \u2202z u2 (0)) (or equivalently U (0)) such that the corresponding\nsolution of L(z, \u03b6, \u2202z )u = 0 (or \u2202z U \u2212G(z, \u03b6)U = 0) is exponentially decaying\nat +\u221e. Lemmas 2.10 and 2.12 show that\nE\u2212 (\u03b6) = \u03a6(0, \u03b6)E\u2212 (G(u, \u03b6))\n\n(2.43)\n\nwhere we use the following notations:\nNotations 2.15. Given a square matrix M , E\u2212 (M ) [resp. E+ (M ) denotes\nthe invariant space of M associated to the spectrum of M contained in\n{Re \u03bc < 0} [resp {Re \u03bc > 0}].\nIn particular, by Lemma 2.12, E\u2212 (\u03b6) is a smooth vector bundle for \u03b6 \u2208\nand dim(E\u2212 (\u03b6)) = Nb .\nThe problems (2.19), (2.21) or (2.25) are well posed if and only if\n\nd+1\nR+ \\{0}\n\n(2.44)\n\nE\u2212 (\u03b6) \u2229 ker \u0393(\u03b6) = {0}\n\nor\n\nE\u2212 (G(u, \u03b6)) \u2229 ker \u0393\u0303(\u03b6) = {0}.\n\nNote that, because the rank of \u0393 is at most Nb and the dimension of E\u2212 is\nNb , this condition implies and is equivalent to\n\u2032\n\n(2.45) CN +N = E\u2212 (\u03b6) \u2295 ker \u0393(\u03b6) or\n\n\u2032\n\nCN +N = E\u2212 (G(u, \u03b6)) \u2295 ker \u0393\u0303(\u03b6).\n\nThe Evans function is defined as\n(2.46)\n\n\u0001\nD(\u03b6) = det N +N \u2032 E\u2212 (\u03b6), ker \u0393(\u03b6)\n\nwhere, for subspaces E and F of Cn , detn (E, F) is equal to 0 if dim E+dim F 6=\nn and is the n \u00d7 n determinant formed by orthonormal bases in E and F if\ndim E + dim F = n.\n18\n\n\fRemark 2.16. The definition of the determinant above depends on choices\nof bases. Note that changing bases in E and F changes the determinant by\na complex number of modulus one, thus leaves | det(E, F)| invariant. But it\nalso depends on the choice of a scalar product on Cn . Changing the scalar\nproducts (or changing of bases in Cn )) changes the function det(E, F) to a\nf\nf\nnew function det(E,\nF) such that c| det(E, F)| \u2264 |det(E,\nF)| \u2264 c\u22121 | det(E, F)|\nwhere c > 0 is independent of the spaces E and F. We will denote by\nf or D \u2248 D\ne\n(2.47)\ndet \u2248 det\nthis property. In particular, the definition of D is independent of the choice\nof orthonormal bases in E\u2212 and ker \u0393 and all the uniform stability conditions\nstated below are independent of the choice of the scalar product.\n\nRemark 2.17. If the coefficients of the operator and the profile depend\nsmoothly on parameters p, then the Evans function is also a smooth function\nof the parameters.\nThese notations being settled, the weak stability condition, which is a\nnecessary condition for well posedness in Sobolev spaces of (2.17), reads:\nDefinition 2.18. Given a profile w, the linearized equation (2.17) satisfies\nd+1\nthe weak spectral stability condition if D(\u03b6) 6= 0 for all \u03b6 \u2208 R+ \\{0}.\nThe next lemma is useful and elementary.\nLemma 2.19. Suppose that E \u2282 Cn and \u0393 : Cn \u2192\n7 Cm , with rank\u0393 =\ndim E = m. If | det(E, ker \u0393)| \u2265 c > 0, then there is C, which depends only\non c and |\u0393\u2217 (\u0393\u0393\u2217 )\u22121 | such that\n\u2200U \u2208 E\n\n|U | \u2264 C|\u0393U |.\n\nConversely, if this estimate is satisfied then | det(E, ker \u0393)| \u2265 c where c > 0\ndepends only on C and |\u0393|.\n\nProof. Let \u03c0 = \u0393\u2217 (\u0393\u0393\u2217 )\u22121 \u0393 denote the orthogonal projector on (ker \u0393)\u22a5 .\nDiagonalizing the hermitian form (\u03c0e, \u03c0e), yields orthonormal bases {ej }\nand {fj } in E and (ker \u0393)\u22a5 respectively, such that \u03c0ej = \u03bbj fj with 0 <\n\u03bbj \u2264 1. Take any basis {gk } ofQker \u0393. Expressing the ej in the base {fk , gl },\nimplies that | det(E, ker \u0393)| = \u03bbj . Since \u03bbj \u2264 1 for all j, if this determinant\nis larger than or equal to c > 0, then min \u03bbj \u2265 c and for all e \u2208 E\nc|e| \u2264 |\u03c0e| \u2264 |\u0393\u2217 (\u0393\u0393\u2217 )\u22121 | |\u0393e|.\n\nConversely, if the estimate is satisfied, then |e| \u2264 C|\u0393| |\u03c0e| since \u0393e = \u0393\u03c0e\nfor all e \u2208 E. Therefore \u03bbj C|\u0393| \u2265 1 and the determinant is at least equal to\n(C|\u0393|)\u2212m .\n19\n\n\fThere are analogous definitions for the linearized hyperbolic problem\n(2.33) with boundary conditions (2.42). For \u03b3 > 0, H0 (u, \u03b6) has no eigenvalues on the imaginary axis, as a consequence of the hyperbolicity assumption (see Remark 2.4). The Lopatinski determinant is defined for\n:= {\u03b3 > 0} by\n\u03b6 \u2208 Rd+1\n+\n\u0001\n(2.48)\nDLop (\u03b6) = det E\u2212 (H0 (u, \u03b6), ker \u0393red .\nBy homogeneity of H0 , this determinant is homogeneous of degree zero in \u03b6\nand one can restrict attention to \u03b6 \u2208 S d = {|\u03b6| = 1}.\n\nDefinition 2.20. The linearized equation (2.33) (2.42) satisfies the weak\nspectral stability condition if DLop (\u03b6) 6= 0 for all \u03b6 \u2208 Rd+1\n+ .\n\n2.4\n\nUniform spectral stability and maximal estimates\n\nThe weak stability conditions and the reduction to constant coefficients of\nd+1\nLemma 2.10 guarantee the well posedness of (2.19) for fixed \u03b6 \u2208 R+ \\{0}\nand in particular estimates of the form\n(2.49)\n\nkukL2 + k\u2202z u2 kL2 + |u(0)| + |\u2202z u2 (0)| \u2264 C(\u03b6)(kf kL2 + |g|).\n\nThe next step in the study of (2.17), is to perform an inverse Fourier-Laplace\ntransform and thus requires suitable estimates for the solutions of (2.19),\nwith a precise description of the constants in the estimate above.\nBy continuity in \u03b6, the weak stability condition implies that the estimate\n(2.49) is satisfied with a uniform constant C when \u03b6 remains in a compact\nd+1\nsubset of R+ \\{0}.

Given a profile w, the linearized equation (2.19) satisfies\nthe low-frequency uniform spectral stability condition if and only if\ni) w is transversal,\nii) the reduced problem (2.73) satisfies the reduced uniform stability\ncondition.\nProof. We have already shown that the low-frequency uniform stability requires that w is transversal.

Since \u0393P is surjective from E\u2212 (P ) onto FP , for all\nuH \u2208 E\u2212 (H) there is uP \u2208 E\u2212 (P ) such that \u0393P uP = \u2212\u03c0P \u0393H uH and (2.76)\nimplies (2.75).\nConversely, if the profile is transverse, the estimate (2.70) is valid at\n\u03b6 = 0 and extend by continuity to \u03b6 in a neighborhood of 0. With (2.75),\nthis clearly implies (2.76).\n\nIt remains to link the reduced uniform stability condition to the uniform\n(Lopatinski) stability condition for the hyperbolic boundary value problem,\nthat is for the problem (2.33) with boundary conditions (2.42). Note that\nthese boundary conditions are given by \u0393red = \u0393red (0) (see Remark 2.14).\nBecause H vanishes at \u03b6 = 0, it is natural to use polar coordinates:\n(2.77)\n\n\u03b6 = \u03c1\u03b6\u030c,\n\n\u03c1 = |\u03b6|, \u03b6\u030c \u2208 S d .\n\nIn these coordinates\n(2.78)\n\nH(u, \u03b6) = \u03c1\u021e(u, \u03b6\u030c, \u03c1),\n\n\u021e(u, \u03b6\u030c, \u03c1) = H0 (u, \u03b6\u030c) + O(\u03c1).\n\nChanging z to \u017e = \u03c1z, u(z) to \u01d4(\u017e) and f (z) to \u03c1f\u02c7(\u017e) the reduced problem\n(2.73) is equivalent to\n(2.79)\n\n\u2202\u017e \u01d4H \u2212 H(u, \u03b6\u030c, \u03c1)\u01d4H = f\u02c7H ,\n26\n\n\u0393red (\u03b6)\u01d4H (0) = h,\n\n\fwhich, for \u03c1 = 0, is exactly the inviscid problem (2.35) (2.42).

For \u03b3\u030c > 0, H0 (u, \u03b6\u030c) has no eigenvalues on the imaginary\naxis, as a consequence of hyperbolicity (see Remark 2.4). By perturbation,\nthis property holds true for \u021e(u, \u03b6\u030c, \u03c1) for \u03c1 small enough (depending on \u03b3\u030c >\n0). This shows that the vector bundle E\u2212 (\u021e(u, \u03b6\u030c, \u03c1) which was defined on\nd\nS + \u00d7]0, \u03c10 ] has a smooth extension to \u2208 S + \u00d7[0, \u03c10 ], as well as \u010e.

Given a transverse profile w, if the reduced uniform spectral stability condition is satisfied, then the linearized hyperbolic problem\n(2.33) (2.42) satisfies reduced uniform stability condition.\nConversely, if the linearized hyperbolic problem is uniformly stable and\nd\nthe vector bundle E\u2212 (\u021e(u, \u03b6\u030c, \u03c1) has a continous extension to S + \u00d7 [0, \u03c10 ],\nthen the reduced uniform spectral stability condition is satisfied and the linearized problem (2.17) satisfies the uniform low-frequency stability condition.\nProof.

If \u03b3\u030c > 0, every term is\ncontinuous up to \u03c1 = 0 and the estimate above implies (2.64), that is\n|u| \u2264 C|\u0393red (0)u|\nd .

It is proved in [M\u00e9Zu3] that when the eigenvalues of the hyperbolic symbol A(u, \u03be) have constant multiplicity, and more generally when\nthere is a smooth K family of symmetrizers (see the definition below), then\nthe vector bundle E\u2212 (\u021e(u, \u03b6\u030c, \u03c1) has a continuous extension to \u03c1 = 0. The\nmain concern of this paper is to construct K-families for systems with variable multiplicity. This is possible under suitable assumptions, and therefore\nthe two theorems above extend a result of F.Rousset [Rou]. However, we\nwill also show that the bundle E does not always admit a continuous extension, with the result that the hyperbolic problem can be uniformly stable\nwhile the viscous problem is strongly unstable in the low-frequency regime.\nThis seems to be a new phenomenon.\nAssuming transversality of w, Theorem 2.28 implies that the uniform\nspectral stability for low frequency is equivalent to the spectral stability for\nthe reduced problem.

Suppose that the profile w is transversal. Then the maximal\nestimates (2.53) are valid for low frequencies if and only if the maximal\nestimates (2.82) for the reduced problem hold true.\nProof. By Lemma 2.12 P (u, \u03b6) has no purely imaginary eigenvalues. Thus,\nusing symmetrizers (see e.g. [M\u00e9Zu1] and Section 3 below), there holds\n(2.84)\n(2.85)\n\n+\n+\nku+\nP kL2 + |uP (0)| . kfP kL2 ,\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\nku\u2212\nP kL2 . kfP kL2 + |uP (0)|,\n\nwhere \u00b1 denotes the smooth projections on the spaces E\u00b1 (P (u, \u03b6).\n28\n\n\fThe splitting (2.71) implies that the boundary condition (2.68) reads\n\u03c0H g = \u0393red uH (0) + \u03c0H \u0393P u+\nP (0),\n+\n\u03c0P g = \u0393P u\u2212\nP (0) + \u03c0P \u0393H uH (0) + \u03c0H \u0393P uP (0).\n\u2212\nMoreover \u0393P is invertible on E\u2212 (P ), hence |\u0393P u\u2212\nP (0)| \u2248 |uP (0)| and\n\n|\u0393red uH (0)| . |\u03c0H g| + |u+\nP (0)|,\n\n+\n|u\u2212\nP (0)| . |\u03c0P g| + |uH (0)| + |uP (0)|.\n\nSuppose that the estimate (2.83) is satisfied. Then,\n\u03c6kuH kL2 + |uH (0)| . \u03c6\u22121 kfH kL2 + |\u03c0H g| + |u+\nP (0)|.\nWith (2.84), this implies that\n\u2212\n\u03c6kuH kL2 + ku\u2212\nP kL2 +|uH (0)| + |uP (0)|\n\n. \u03c6\u22121 kfH kL2 + kfP\u2212 kL2 + |g| + |u+\nP (0)|.\n\nThus, with (2.84), we obtain that\n\u03c6kuH kL2 + kuP kL2 + |uH (0)| + |uP (0)| . \u03c6\u22121 kfH kL2 + kfP kL2 + |g|.\n\ne = V (uH , uP ) = (U\ne 1, U\ne 2)\nBecause V (u, 0) has the special form (2.30), U\nsatisfies\ne 1 = O(1)uH + O(1)uP ,\nU\n\ne 1 = O(|\u03b6|)uH + O(1)uP\nU\n\nTherefore, the solutions of (2.25) satisfy\n\ne (0)| . \u03c6\u22121 kFekL2 + |g|.\ne 2 kL2 + |U\ne 1 kL2 + kU\n\u03c6kU\n\nthat is the maximal estimate (2.53).\n\nConversely, assume that the maximal estimate (2.53) is satisfied. Suppose that uH is a solution of (2.66). By transversality, \u0393P is surjective from\nE\u2212 (P, \u03b6) to its image FP (\u03b6) and there exists there is uP (0) in E\u2212 (P, \u03b6) such\nthat\n(2.86)\n\n\u0393P uP (0) = \u2212\u03c0P \u0393H uH (0) \u2208 FP (\u03b6).\n\nConsider uP = ezP uP (0) which is well defined and rapidly decaying at\ninfinity since uP (0) \u2208 E\u2212 (P, \u03b6). It is a solution of (2.67) with fP = 0.\ne = V (uH , uP ) is a solution of (2.25) with Fe = V (fH , 0). Thus\nThen U\ne and there holds\n(uH , uP ) = V \u22121 U\ne kL2 ,\nkuH kL2 . kU\n\ne (0)|,\n|uH (0)| . |U\n\nkFekL2 . kfH kL2\n\neU\ne (0) = \u0393H uH (0) + \u0393P uP (0) = \u0393red uH (0). Thus the estiand, by (2.86), \u0393\nmate (2.53) immediately implies (2.83).\n29\n\n\f3\n\nLow frequency analysis: the main results\n\nThis section is mainly devoted to the study of the reduced equation (2.79),\nwhich is a nonsingular perturbation of the inviscid problem (2.33). Our\ngoal is to perform an analysis without assuming constant multiplicity of\neigenvalues, thus allowing for examples such as MHD. The inviscid case is\nconsidered in [M\u00e9Zu2], and we want to extend the results to small viscous\nperturbations.\n\n3.1\n\nSymmetrizers\n\nConsider the constant-coefficient linear first order system (2.25). For clarity,\nwe drop the tildes and reserve the notation u, U... for the unknowns and call\np \u2208 U the parameter called u in this equation, which now reads\n(3.1)\n\n\u2202z U = G(p, \u03b6)U + F,\n\n\u0393(p, \u03b6)U (0) = g.\n\nTo prove energy estimates for the solutions of this equation, the main step is\nto construct symmetrizers. They are self adjoint matrices \u03a3(p, \u03b6) such that\n\u0001\n(3.2)\nRe \u03a3(p, \u03b6)G(p, \u03b6) > 0.\n\nThe symmetrizer is adapted to the boundary conditions and provides maximal estimates for the traces when\n(3.3)\n\n\u03a3(p, \u03b6) > 0 on ker \u0393(p, \u03b6).\n\nThe construction of such symmetrizers is in two steps: first, one constructs a family of symmetrizers \u03a3\u03ba , which is independent of the boundary\nconditions; second one uses the uniform Lopatinski or Evans condition, to\nprove that if \u03ba is large enough then the simmetrizer is adapted to the boundary condition.\nMore precisely, one considers a splitting\n(3.4)\n\n\u2032\n\nCN +N = E\u2212 (p, \u03b6) \u2295 E+ (p, \u03b6)\n\nwhere E\u2212 (p, \u03b6) is the negative invariant space of G(p, \u03b6) as above while\nE+ (p, \u03b6) can be chosen arbitrarily so that the splitting (3.4) holds . Denoting by \u03a0\u00b1 (p, \u03b6) the projectors associate to this splitting, the family of\nsymmetrizers \u03a3\u03ba is searched so that\n(3.5)\n\n\u03a3\u03ba \u2265 m(\u03ba)(\u03a0+ )\u2217 \u03a0+ \u2212 (\u03a0\u2212 )\u2217 \u03a0\u2212\n30\n\n\fwhere m(\u03ba) \u2192 +\u221e as \u03ba \u2192 +\u221e.\nSince E\u2212 = ker \u03a0+ , the stability condition (2.44) which reads\nker \u0393(p, \u03b6) \u2229 E\u2212 (p, \u03b6) = {0}\n\n(3.6)\n\nis also equivalent to an estimate\n|\u03a0\u2212 u|2 \u2264 C(|\u0393u|2 + |\u03a0+ u|2 ).\n\n(3.7)\n\nTherefore, if the family \u03a3\u03ba satisfies (3.5), then for \u03ba large enough, there\nholds\n\u03a3\u03ba \u2265 cId \u2212 C \u2032 \u0393\u2217 \u0393,\n\n(3.8)\n\nc>0\n\nand therefore \u03a3\u03ba is adapted to the boundary condition \u0393.\nIf Re \u03a3\u03ba G \u2265 \u03b4\u03ba Id, then multiplying the equation by \u03a3\u03ba and integrating\nby parts yields the estimate\n(3.9)\n\n\u03b4\u03ba kU k2L2 + c|U (0)|2 \u2264\n\n1\nkF k2L2 + C \u2032 |g|2 .\n\u03b4\u03ba\n\nThis is the sketch of the general argument. To obtain usable estimates,\nuniform versions of (3.5) (3.7) are needed as well as more precise versions of\n(3.2) (see below). Note that in this approach, the construction os symmetrizers is completely independent of the boundary conditions, and in particular\nof the validity of the stability conditions. In this paper, we concentrate on\nthe construction of families of symmetrizers which satisfy (3.5). They are\ncalled K-families in [M\u00e9Zu2].\n\n3.2\n\nMain results\n\nThe construction of symmetrizers for middle frequencies, is performed in\n[M\u00e9Zu1]. By Lemma 2.12, the matrix G(p, \u03b6) has no eigenvalues on the\nd+1\nimaginary axis when \u03b6 \u2208 R \\{0}. Therefore,\nd+1\n\nLemma 3.1. For all \u03b6 \u2208 R \\{0}, there is a neighborhood of (p, \u03b6) in\nU \u00d7 Rd+1 such that for (p, \u03b6) in this neighborhood there is a smooth splitting\n(3.10)\n\n\u2032\n\nCN = E\u2212 (p, \u03b6) \u2295 E+ (p, \u03b6).\n\nwhere E\u00b1 (p, \u03b6) denote the invariant space of G(p, \u03b6) associated to the spectrum in {\u00b1Re \u03bc > 0}. Denoting by \u03a0\u00b1 (p, \u03b6) the smooth spectral projectors\n31\n\n\fassociate to this splitting, there is a smooth family \u03a3\u03ba (p, \u03b6) of self adjoint\nmatrices such that for all (p, \u03b6) in the given neighborhood and all \u03ba \u2265 1:\n(3.11)\n\ni)\nii)\n\nRe \u03a3\u03ba G \u2265 0,\n\nRe \u03a3\u03ba \u2265 \u03ba(\u03a0+ )\u2217 \u03a0+ \u2212 (\u03a0\u2212 )\u2217 \u03a0\u2212 .\n\nCorollary 3.2. If the weak spectral stability condition is satisfied, then for\nd+1\nall \u03b6 \u2208 R \\{0}, there are a constant C and a neighborhood of (p, \u03b6) in\nU \u00d7 Rd+1 such that for (p, \u03b6) in this neighborhood the solutions of (3.1)\nsatisfy\n\u0001\n(3.12)\nkU kL2 + |U (0)| \u2264 C kF kL2 + |g| .\n\nWe now concentrate on low frequencies. By Lemma 2.12, the matrix\nG(p, \u03b6) is locally smoothly conjugated to a block diagonal matrix (2.28) with\ndiagonal blocks with H(p, \u03b6) of dimension N \u00d7 N and P (p, \u03b6) of dimension\nN \u2032 \u00d7 N \u2032 . The system (3.1) is therefore equivalent to the equations (2.66)\n(2.67) coupled by the boundary conditions (2.68).\nIn the block diagonal reduction (2.28), we construct symmetrizers\n\u0012 \u03ba\n\u0013\n\u03a3H 0\n\u03ba\n(3.13)\n\u03a3 =\n0 \u03a3\u03baP\nsuch that the properties (3.2) ande (3.5) are satisfied for each block independently.\nThe construction of symmetrizers for the elliptic block P is standard\nand identical to the construction for middle frequencies, since P (p, 0) has\nno eigenvalues on the imaginary axis. Denote by E\u00b1\nP (p, \u03b6) the subspaces\n\u2032\nof CN , invariant for P (p, \u03b6), associated to the spectrum in {\u00b1Re \u03bc > 0}.\nThus, for (p, \u03b6) in a neighborhood of (p, 0), there is a smooth splitting\n\u2032\n\n+\nCN = E\u2212\nP \u2295 EP .\n\n(3.14)\n\nDenote by \u03a0\u00b1\nP (p, \u03b6) the smooth spectral projectors associate to this splitting.\nProposition 3.3. There is a smooth family of self adjoint matrices \u03a3\u03baP on\na neighborhood of (p, 0) such that\n(3.15)\n\ni)\nii)\n\nRe \u03a3\u03baP P > 0,\n\u2212 \u2217 \u2212\n\u2217 +\nRe \u03a3\u03baP \u2265 \u03ba(\u03a0+\nP ) \u03a0P \u2212 (\u03a0P ) \u03a0P\n\nThis implies the estimates (2.84) (2.85) which where used in the previous\nsection.\n32\n\n\fTo analyze H, we use polar coordinates for \u03b6 = \u03c1\u03b6\u030c as in (2.77) so that\n(3.16)\n\nH(p, \u03b6) = \u03c1\u021e(p, \u03b6\u030c, \u03c1),\n\n\u021e(p, \u03b6\u030c, \u03c1) = H0 (p, \u03b6\u030c) + O(\u03c1).\n\nBy Lemma 2.12, for \u03b6 \u2208 Rd+1\n+ \\{0}, \u021e has no eigenvalue on the imaginary\naxis, hence the number N \u2212 of eigenvalues of \u021e in {Re \u03bc < 0} is constant.\nd\nWe fix a point \u03b6\u030c \u2208 S + , that is \u03b6\u030c = (\u03c4\u030c , \u03b7\u030c, \u03b3\u030c) in the unit sphere with \u03b3\u030c \u2265 0.\nThe goal is to construct smooth symmetrizers for \u021e, for (p, \u03b6\u030c, \u03c1) close to\n(p, \u03b6\u030c, 0). For convenience we introduce the following terminology.\nDefinition 3.4. A smooth symmetrizer for \u021e on a neighborhood \u03c9 of (p, \u03b6\u030c, 0)\nis a smooth self adjoint matrix \u03a3\u030cH (p, \u03b6\u030c, \u03c1) such that\nX\n(3.17)\nRe \u03a3\u030cH \u021e =\nVk\u2217 \u03a3k Vk ,\n\nwhere the Vk and \u03a3k are smooth matrices on \u03c9 of appropriate dimension so\nthat the products\nP \u2217 make sense, satisfying\ni)\nVk Vk is definite positive,\nii) either \u03a3k is definite positive or \u03a3k = \u03b3\u03a3k,1 + \u03c1\u03a3k,2 with \u03a3k,1 and\n\u03a3k,2 definite positive.\nDefinition 3.5. A family of smooth symmetrizers \u03a3\u03ba on neigborhoods \u03c9 \u03ba\nof (p, \u03b6\u030c, 0) is called a K-family of symmetrizers for \u021e if there are a decomposition\n(3.18)\n\n+\nCN = E\u2212\nH \u2295 EH\n\nwith dim E\u2212 = N\u2212 and m(\u03ba) \u2192 +\u221e as \u03ba \u2192 +\u221e such that for all \u03ba\n(3.19)\n\n\u03a3\u03ba (p, \u03b6\u030c, 0) \u2265 m(\u03ba)\u03a0\u2217+ \u03a0+ \u2212 \u03a0\u2217\u2212 \u03a0\u2212 .\n\nwhere \u03a0\u00b1 are the projectors associated to the splitting (3.18).\nRemark 3.6. Recall from [M\u00e9Zu3] that if there is K-family of symmetrizers, then E\u2212 is the limit of the negative spaces E\u2212 (p, \u03b6\u030c, \u03c1) as (p, \u03b6\u030c, \u03c1) tends\nto (p, \u03b6\u030c, 0) with \u03c1 > 0. Thus E\u2212 is uniquely determined. On the other hand,\nE+ is arbitrary, provided that the the splitting (3.18) holds: if (3.19) holds\nfor some choice of E+ , then it also holds for another choice for a multiple of\n\u03a3\u03ba with some other function m(\u03ba).\nWe can now state the main result of this paper, which extends [M\u00e9Zu2].\n\n33\n\n\fTheorem 3.7. Suppose that the Assumptions of Section 2.1 are satisfied.\nAssume further that one of the following two condition is satisfied:\ni) all the real characteristic roots (p, \u03c4, \u03be) with |\u03be| = 1 satisfy the condition (BS) of Definition 4.9.\nii) the system is symmetric dissipative in the sense of Definition 2.5\nand the real characteristic roots (p, \u03c4, \u03be) with |\u03be| = 1 are either totally\nnonglancing in the sense of Definition 4.3 or satisfy the condition (BS) of\nDefinition 4.9.\nd\nThen, for all \u03b6\u030c \u2208 S + , there exists K-families of smooth symmetrizers for\n\u021e(p, \u03b6, \u03c1) near (p, \u03b6\u030c, 0).\nThe condition (BS) ensures that a suitable generalized block structure\ncondition, which makes the construction of symmetrizers given in [M\u00e9Zu1]\nwork, is satisfied. For hyperbolic problems, it is shown in [M\u00e9Zu2] that the\nblock structure condition is satisfied if the system is smoothly diagonalizable. In the viscous case, things are more subtle and the generalized block\nstructure condition is discussed in details in Section 3. We just point out\nhere the following example.\n\u02c7 is a semi-simple characteristic root of constant\nTheorem 3.8. If (p, \u03c4\u030c , \u03be)\nmultiplicity, then the condition (BS) of Definition 4.9 is satisfied at that\npoint.\nTogether with Theorem 3.7, this implies Theorem 1.1. Finally, we quote\nthat the existence of K-families implies the validity of the maximal estimates when the boundary conditions satisfy the uniform spectral stability\nconditions.\nTheorem 3.9. Suppose that there exists a K-families of symmetrizers for\n\u021e near (p, \u03b6\u030c, 0) and suppose that the boundary conditions are such that the\nuniform spectral stability condition is satisfied for low frequencies. Then the\nuniform stability estimates (2.53) are satisfied.\nSimilarly, if the reduced boundary conditions satisfy the reduced uniform\nstability condition then the uniform estimates (2.82) and (2.83) hold true.\n\n3.3\n\nBlock reductions\n\nThe advantage of the notion of K-families is that it is independent of the\nboundary conditions. Therefore, their construction depend only on an analysis of \u021e. In particular, we can use spectral block decompositions of \u021e.\n\n34\n\n\fd\n\nFix \u03b6\u030c \u2208 S + . Consider the distinct eigenvalues \u03bck of H0 (p, \u03b6\u030c). For (p, \u03b6\u030c, \u03c1)\nin a neighborhood of (p, \u03b6\u030c, 0), there is a smooth block reduction\nV \u22121 \u021eV = diag(\u021ek )\n\n(3.20)\n\nwhere the Hk have their spectrum in small discs centered at \u03bck that are\npairwise disjoints. Equivalently, there is a smooth decomposition\nM\n(3.21)\nCN =\nEk (p, \u03b6\u030c, \u03c1)\nk\n\nin invariant spaces for \u021e(p, \u03b6\u030c, \u03c1) and \u021ek is the restriction of \u021e to Ek . We\ndenote by Nk the dimension of Ek , that is the size of \u021ek .\nThe K-families of symmetrizers are constructed for each block \u021ek separately. If \u03a3\u03bak is a K-family for \u021ek , it is clear that \u03a3\u03ba = V \u2217 diag(\u03a3\u03bak )V has\nthe form (3.17) and is a K-family for \u021e.\nWhen the mode is elliptic, that is when Re \u03bck 6= 0, the construction of\nsymmetrizers is easy (see e.g. [Kre, ChPi, M\u00e9Zu1]).\nProposition 3.10. Suppose that \u03bck is an eigenvalue of H0 (p, \u03b6\u030c) with Re \u03bck 6=\n0.

In particular, by hyperbolicity, this can only happen when\n\u03b3\u030c = 0. By Lemma 2.12, \u021ek has no eigenvalues on the imaginary axis when\n\u03c1 > 0, thus the number of eigenvalues in {Re \u03bc < 0} is constant. We call it\nNk\u2212 .

Suppose that the system is symmetric dispersive in the\nsense of Definition 2.5; suppose in addition that (p, \u03c4\u030c , \u03be\u030c) is a totally incoming\nor outgoing characteristic root in the sense of Definition 4.3. Then there are\nK-families of symmetrizers for the associated block \u021ek , with E\u2212\nk = {0} in\nNk in the incoming case.\n=\nC\nthe outgoing case and E\u2212\nk\n\u02c7 is a characteristic root which satisfies the generTheorem 3.13. If (p, \u03c4\u030c , \u03be)\nalized block structure condition of Definition 4.22. Then there are K-families\nof symmetrizers for the associated block \u021ek .\n\n4\n4.1\n\nThe generalized block structure condition\nHyperbolic multiple roots\n\nWe first recall from [M\u00e9Zu2] several notations and definitions concerning the\ncharacteristic roots of the hyperbolic part L. For simplicity, we suppose, as\nwe may, that the coefficient of \u2202t is A0 = Id, so that, with notations (2.3),\nL = L. The characteristic determinant is denoted by\n(4.1)\n\n\u2206(p, \u03c4, \u03be) := det(\u03c4 Id + A(p, \u03be)).\n\nDefinition 4.1. Consider a root (p, \u03c4 , \u03be) of \u2206(p, \u03c4 , \u03be)) = 0, of algebraic\nmultiplicity m in \u03c4 .\ni) (p, \u03c4 , \u03be) is algebraically regular, if on a neighborhood \u03c9 of (p, \u03be) there\nare m smooth real functions \u03bbj (p, \u03be), analytic in \u03be, such that \u03bbj (p, \u03be) = \u2212\u03c4\n36\n\n\fand for (p, \u03be) \u2208 \u03c9:\n(4.2)\n\n\u2206(p, \u03c4, \u03be) = e(p, \u03c4, \u03be)\n\nm\nY\n\nj=1\n\n\u0001\n\u03c4 + \u03bbj (p, \u03be)\n\nwhere e is a polynomial in \u03c4 with smooth coefficients such that e(p, \u03c4 , \u03be) 6= 0.\nii) (p, \u03c4 , \u03be) is geometrically regular if in addition there are m smooth\nfunctions ej (p, \u03be) on \u03c9 with values in CN , analytic in \u03be, such that\n(4.3)\n\nA(p, \u03be)ej (p, \u03be) = \u03bbj (p, \u03be)ej (p, \u03be),\n\nand the e1 , . . . , em are linearly independent.\niii) (p, \u03c4 , \u03be) is semi-simple with constant multiplicity if all the \u03bbj 's are\nequal.\nCase iii) occurs when \u03bb(p, \u03be) is a continuous semi-simple eigenvalue of\nA(p, \u03be) with constant multiplicity near (p, \u03be), such \u03c4 + \u03bb(p, \u03be) = 0. This\nimplies that \u03bb is smooth and analytic in \u03be as well as the eigenspace ker(A\u2212\u03bb).\nIn this case, one can choose for {ej } any smooth basis of of this eigenspace.\nIf all the roots at (p, \u03be) are geometrically regular, then, locally near (p, \u03be),\nA(p, \u03be) is smoothly diagonalizable, meaning that it has a smooth basis of\neigenvectors.\nExample 4.2. For the inviscid MHD, the multiple eigenvalues are algebraically regular, but some are not geometrically regular (see [M\u00e9Zu2] and\nSection 8 below).\nThe second notion which plays an important role in the analysis of hyperbolic boundary value problems is the notion of glancing modes . Recall\nfrom [M\u00e9Zu2] the following definition. If \u03c4 is a root of multiplicity m of the\npolynomial \u2206(p, *, \u03be), then by hyperbolicity, the Taylor expansion of \u2206 at\n(p, \u03c4 , \u03be) at the order m \u2212 1 vanishes so that\n(4.4)\n\n\u2206(p, \u03c4 + \u03c4, \u03be + \u03be) = \u2206m (\u03c4, \u03be) + O(|\u03c4, \u03be|m+1 )\n\nand \u2206m is homogeneous of degree m. Moreover, \u2206m is hyperbolic in the time\ndirection. Indeed, any direction of hyperbolicity for \u2206(p, *) is a direction of\nhyperbolicity for \u2206m . Denote by \u0393+ the open convex cone of hyperbolic\ndirections fot \u2206m which contains dt.\nDefinition 4.3. The root (p, \u03c4 , \u03be) of \u2206, of multiplicity m, is said nonglancing when the boundary is noncharacteristic for \u2206.\nIt is totally incoming [resp. outgoing] when the inward [resp. outward]\nconormal to the boundary belongs to \u0393+ . It is totally nonglancing if is either\ntotally incoming or totally outgoing.\n37\n\n\fExample 4.4. This definition agrees with the usual one for simple roots,\ngiven by \u03c4 + \u03bb(p, \u03be) = 0. In this case \u2202t + \u2207\u03be \u03bb * \u2202x is is the Hamiltonian\ntransport field for the propagation of singularities or oscillations and the\nglancing condition \u2202\u03bed \u03bb = 0 precisely means that the field is tangent to the\nboundary. More generally, if the root (p, \u03c4 , \u03be) of \u2206 is algebraically regular,\nthen, with notations as in (4.2)\n(4.5)\n\n\u2206m (\u03c4, \u03be) = e(p, \u03c4 , \u03be)\n\nm\nY\n\nj=1\n\n\u0001\n\u03c4 + \u03be * \u2207\u03be \u03bbj (p, \u03be)\n\nThe mode is nonglancing if none of the tangential speed \u2202\u03bed \u03bbj (p, \u03be) vanish.\nIt is totally incoming [resp. outgoing] if they all are positive [resp. negative].\nIn particular, in the constant multiplicity case, all the \u03bbj are equal and they\nare all glancing, incoming or outgoing at the same time.\nIn the study of boundary value problems, the dichotomy incoming vs outgoing plays a crucial role: for instance, for transport equations one boundary\ncondition is needed in the first case and none in the second. Using symmetrizers to prove energy estimates, they are constructed in opposite ways.\nThe general Kreiss construction also reflects this dichotomy. Introduce the\nfollowing definition:\nDefinition 4.5. Suppose that (p, \u03c4 , \u03be) is an algebraically regular root of \u2206.\nWith notations as in (4.2), denote by \u03bdj the order of \u03be d is a root of order\nof the equation \u03c4 + \u03bbj (p, \u03be 1 , . . . , \u03be d\u22121 , *) = 0, that is the positive integer such\nthat\n(4.6)\n\n\u2202\u03bead \u03bbj (p, \u03be) = 0\n\nfor a < \u03bdj\n\nand\n\n\u03b2j :=\n\n1 \u03bdj\n\u2202 \u03bbj (p, \u03be) 6= 0.\n\u03bdj ! \u03bed\n\nWe say that \u03bbj is of type I when either \u03bdj is even or \u03bdj is odd and \u03b2j > 0.\nIt is of type O when \u03bdj is odd and \u03b2j < 0.\nWe denote by JO [resp. JI ] the set of indices j of the corresponding type.\n\u02c7 is non glancing, then the all the \u03bdj are equal to\nRemark 4.6. When (p, \u03c4\u030c , \u03be)\n1, and being of type I [resp. type O] means to be incoming [resp. outgoing].\nThey are all of the same type exactly when the mode is totally nonglancing.\nRemark 4.7. The details of the construction of Kreiss' symmetrizers depend strongly on being of type I or O, see [Kre, ChPi, M\u00e93] and Section 5.\nThere are no reason other than technical why even roots are of type I rather\nthan O.\n38\n\n\f4.2\n\nThe decoupling condition\n\nThe spectral properties of A(\u03be) are modified by the perturbation B. In\nparticular, since the construction of symmetrizers depends deeply on the\nproperty of being incoming/outgoing, it is very important that the perturbation respects the decoupling between the different type of modes.\nDefinition 4.8. Suppose that (p, \u03c4 , \u03be) is a geometrically regular root of \u2206\nof order m. Consider a basis {ej } as in (4.3) and dual left eigenvectors lj\nsuch that\n\u0001\n(4.7)\nlj \u03c4 Id + A(p, \u03be) = 0, lj * ej \u2032 (p, \u03be) = \u03b4j,j \u2032 .\nConsider the and the m \u00d7 m matrix with entries\n\n\u266f\nBj,j\n\u2032 = lj B(p, \u03be)ej \u2032 (p, \u03be)\n\n(4.8)\n\ni) We say that the decoupling condition is satisfied if\n(4.9)\n\n\u266f\nBj,j\n\u2032 = 0\n\nwhen\n\n(j, j \u2032 ) \u2208 (JO \u00d7 JI ) \u222a (JI \u00d7 JO )\n\nwhere J0 and JI are introduced in Definition 4.5.\nii) We say that the basis {ej } is adapted to B if\n(4.10)\n\nRe B \u266f > 0.\n\nDefinition 4.9. We say that the root (p, \u03c4 , \u03be) of \u2206 satisfies the condition\n(BS) if is is geometrically regular root, satisfies the decoupling condition\n(4.9) and there is an eigenbasis basis {ej } adapted to B.\nWe give several examples and counterexamples. The next result rephrases\nTheorem 3.8.\nProposition 4.10. (Constant multiplicity) Suppose that (p, \u03c4 , \u03be) is a semisimple characteristic root with constant multiplicity of \u2206. Then the condition (BS) is satisfied.\nProof. For semi-simple characteristic root \u03bb with constant multiplicity either\nJO or JI is empty so that the decoupling condition (4.9) is trivially satisfeid.\nMoreover, it is proved in [M\u00e9Zu1] that (H1) implies that the spectrum of\nB \u266f is located in {Re z > 0}. Thus there is a basis {ej } in ker(A(p, \u03be) + \u03c4 Id)\nsuch that Re B \u266f is definite positive. Next, since any smooth basis {ej } in\nker(A \u2212 \u03bb) satisfies (4.3), one can choose it such that ej (p, \u03be) = ej .\n39\n\n\fProposition 4.11. (Artificial viscosity) Suppose that (p, \u03c4 , \u03be) is geometrically regular for iA + B in the sense that there are m smooth functions\n\u03bbj (p, \u03be, \u03c1) and m linearly independent smooth vectors ej (p, \u03be, \u03c1) on a neighborhood of (p, \u03be, \u03c1), analytic in \u03be, such that \u03bbj (p, \u03be, 0) = \u2212\u03c4 for all j and\n(4.11)\n\n\u0001\niA(p, \u03be) + \u03c1B(p, \u03be) ej (p, \u03be, \u03c1) = i\u03bbj (p, \u03be, \u03c1)ej (p, \u03be, \u03c1).\n\nThen, the decoupling condition is satisfied and the basis {ej |\u03c1=0 } is adapted\nto B.\nProof. Alternately, differentiating (4.3) with respect to \u03c1 and multiplying on\nthe left by lj \u2032 , implies that Bj\u266f\u2032 ,j = 0 when j 6= j \u2032 . Moreover, (H1) implies\n\n\u266f\nthat Bj,j\n> 0.\n\nFor example, if (p, \u03c4 , \u03be) is geometrically regular for A in the sense of\nDefinition 4.1 and if B = \u2206x Id is an artificial viscosity, then (p, \u03c4 , \u03be) is\ngeometrically regular for iA + B. However, this condition is too restrictive\nfor applications, in particular when A and B do not commute.\nExample 4.12. If the root is totally nonglancing, then the decoupling condition is trivially satisfied since either JI or JO is empty. This applies to\nfast shocks in MHD.\nCounter example 4.13. Slow shocks in MHD do not satisfy the decoupling\ncondition, see Section 8.\nThe decoupling condition is crucial in the construction of symmetrizers.\nThe second condition (4.10) is more technical. One could expect that with\nthe positivity Assumption (H1), one could always find an adapted basis.\nThis is not clear, except for mutliplicity 2 or symmetric systems.\nProposition 4.14. Suppose that (p, \u03c4 , \u03be) is geometrically regular of multiplicity m. Assume that either m = 2 or that the symmetry assumption (H1')\nis satisfied. There is a basis {ej } adapted to B.\nIf in addition all the eigenvalues \u03bbj are of the same type O or I, then\nthe condition (BS) is satisfied.\nThe proof is given Section 6.\n\n40\n\n\f4.3\n\nThe hyperbolic block structure condition\n\nWe turn back to the construction of symmetrizers for nonelliptic blocks \u021ek in\nthe splitting (3.20). The construction of K-families is performed in [M\u00e9Zu1]\nprovided that \u021ek can be put in a suitable normal form. This is the so called\nblock structure condition. We first review this condition in the hyperbolic\ncase, and next extend it to the hyperbolic-parabolic case.\nConsider p and a frequency \u03b6\u030c = (\u03c4\u030c , \u03b7\u030c, 0) 6= 0 and a purely imaginary\n\u02c7 is a\neigenvalue (3.23) \u03bck = i\u03be\u030c d of H0 (p, \u03b6\u030c). Let \u03be\u030c = (\u03b7\u030c, \u03be\u030c d ). Then (p, \u03c4\u030c , \u03be)\nroot of \u2206. We consider the block \u021ek associated to \u03bck and denote by Ek\nthe corresponding invariant space of \u021e. We use the notations \u021ek,0 (p, \u03b6\u030c) =\n\u021ek (p, \u03b6\u030c, 0) and Ek,0 (p, \u03b6\u030c) = Ek (p, \u03b6\u030c, 0).\nDefinition 4.15. \u021ek,0 has the block structure property near (p, \u03b6\u030c) if there\nexists a smooth invertible matrix Vk,0 on a neighborhood of that point such\n\u22121\nthat Vk,0\n\u021ek,0 Vk,0 is block diagonal,\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\nQ1 0\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\u22121\n(4.12)\nVk,0\n\u021ek,0 Vk,0 = \uf8f0 0 . . .\n\uf8fb,\n0\n0 Qm\u2032\nwith diagonal blocks Qj of size \u03bdj \u00d7 \u03bdj such that :\nQj (p, \u03b6\u030c) has purely imaginary coefficients when\n\uf8ee\n0 1\n0\n\uf8ef\n.\n..\n\uf8ef 0 0\n(4.13)\nQj (p, \u03b6\u030c) = \u03bck Id + i \uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n.. ..\n\uf8f0\n.\n.\n***\n\n\u03b3\u030c = 0,\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fa\n0 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa,\n\uf8fa\n1 \uf8fb\n0\n\nand the real part of the lower left hand corner of \u2202\u03b3\u030c Qj (p, \u03b6), denoted by qj\u266d ,\ndoes not vanish.\n\nWhen \u03bdj = 1, Qj (p, \u03b6\u030c) is a scalar. In this case, (4.13) has to be understood as Qj (p, \u03b6\u030c) = \u03bck , with no Jordan's block. The lower left hand corner\nof the matrix is Qj itself and the condition reads qj\u266d := \u2202\u03b3\u030c Qj (p, \u03b6\u030c) 6= 0.\n\u02c7 is geometrically regular\nProposition 4.16 ([M\u00e9Zu2]). If the root (p, \u03c4\u030c , \u03be)\nin the sense of Definition 4.1, the corresponding block \u021ek,0 satisfies the block\nstructure condition.\nConversely, if \u021ek,0 satisfies the block structure condition with matrices\n\u02c7 is geometrically regular.\nV that are real analytic in \u03b6\u030c, then the root (p, \u03c4\u030c , \u03be)\n41\n\n\fRemark 4.17. There is a slight discrepancy here between the necessary\nand the sufficient condition, due to analyticity conditions. Definition 4.1\nrequires analyticity in \u03be\u030c. This is used in the proof of sufficiency. In addition,\nit implies that the block structure condition holds with matrices V that are\nreal analytic in \u03b6\u030c. Thus, there is an \"if and only if\" theorem. However,\nfor the construction of symmetrizers, analyticity of Vk is not needed, this is\nwhy we do not insist on it in the definition above. In addition, note that\nfor fixed p, the existence of C \u221e eigenvalues and eigenvectors for A, implies\nthat these eigenvalues are real analytic in \u03be and that one can choose analytic\neigenvectors (see e.g [Shi, Mal]. The question is to control the domain of\nanalyticity as p varies. In applications, for this problem, proving analyticity\nis not harder than proving the C \u221e smoothness.\nTo prepare the hyperbolic-parabolic analysis, we have to review the\nproof of Proposition 4.16. In particular, we reformulate the conditions\nof Definition 4.15 in a more intrinsic way. The choice of a smooth matrix Vk,0 is equivalent to the choice of a smooth basis of Ek,0 , denoted by\n{\u03c6j,a (p, \u03b6\u030c)}1\u2264j\u2264m\u2032 ,1\u2264a\u2264\u03bdj .

The lower left hand corner entry of\n\u2202\u03b3\u030c Qj (p, \u03b6\u030c) is equal to the lower left hand corner entry of \u2212i\u2202\u03c4\u030c Qj (p, \u03b6\u030c) and\nequal to\nq j = \u2212\u03c8j,\u03bdj (p, \u03b6\u030c) A\u22121\nd (p) \u03c6j,1 (p, \u03b6\u030c).\n\n(4.20)\n\nProof. Let H 0 = H0 (p, \u03b6\u030c). Then H 0 \u2212 \u03bck is invertible on E\u2032k,0 (p, \u03b6\u030c). With\n(4.14) (4.15), this implies that\n\u0001\nrange H 0 \u2212 \u03bck Id = {\u03c81,\u03bd1 (p, \u03b6\u030c), . . . , \u03c8m\u2032 ,\u03bdm\u2032 (p, \u03b6\u030c)}\u22a5 ,\n(4.21)\n\u0001\n(4.22)\nker H 0 \u2212 \u03bck Id = {\u03c61,1 (p, \u03b6\u030c), . . . , \u03c6m\u2032 ,1 (p, \u03b6\u030c)}.\nIn particular,\n(4.23)\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\nH 0 \u2212 \u03bck Id \u03c6j,1 = 0 and \u03c8j,\u03bdj H 0 \u2212 \u03bck Id = 0.\n\nThe entry in consideration is\n\n\u0001\nqj (p, \u03b6\u030c) = \u03c8j,\u03bdj H0 \u03c6j,1 = \u03c8j,\u03bdj H0 \u2212 \u03bck Id \u03c6j,1 + \u03bck \u03b4\u03bdj ,1 .\n\nTherefore, differentiating in \u03b3\u030c and \u03c4\u030c and using (2.27), implies that\n(4.24)\n\n\u2202\u03b3\u030c qj (p, \u03b6\u030c) = \u2212i\u2202\u03c4\u030c qj (p, \u03b6\u030c) = q j\n\nis given by (4.20).\nWe now discuss how much flexibility there is in the choice of the basis\n\u03c6j,a .

This lemma is a variation on the necessary part in Proposition 4.16 (see [M\u00e9Zu2]), with useful additional remarks. It shows that\nthe block structure condition is closely related to a smooth diagonalisation of A. Conversely, if one starts from a smooth basis ej and a root of\n\u02c7 with (4.6), one constructs a basis \u03c6j,a such that \u03c6j,a (p, \u03b6\u030c) is given\n\u03c4\u030c +\u03bbj (p, \u03be)\nby (4.39), using an holomorphic extension of ej to complex values of \u03be\u030cd (see\n[M\u00e9Zu2]). Lemma 4.19 implies that the change of bases which preserve the\nblock structure form are linked to change of bases which preserve the smooth\ndiagonalization of A.\nThe construction of K-families of symmetrizers for the blocks Qj is performed in [Kre, Maj1, M\u00e93]. The sign of \u03b2j and the parity of \u03bdj play an\nimportant role. Hyperbolicity implies that H0 and thus the \u021ek and Qj have\nno purely imaginary eigenvalues when \u03b3\u030c > 0.

Since (p, \u03c4\u030c , \u03be)\nisfies the block structure condition. Moreover, if ej is a basis analytic in\n\u02c7 (see Remark 4.20 or\n\u03be, there is a basis \u03c6j,a such that \u03c6j,a (p, \u03b6\u030c) = ej (p, \u03be)\n[M\u00e9Zu2]). By Lemma 4.24, (4.9) is equivalent to (4.46).\nIf once can choose the base {ej } such that (4.10) holds, then choose\n\u266d\ndj = \u2212\u03b2j and by (4.29) and (4.54) there holds d\u266dj qj\u266d = 1 so that DB \u266d = B \u266f\nsatisfies (4.47).\nRemark 4.26. Conversely, if the generalized block structure condition\nholds with matrices Vk which are real analytic in \u03b6\u030c, then, by Proposition 4.16\n\u02c7 is geometrically regular. By (4.54), (4.46) is equivalent to the de(p, \u03c4\u030c , \u03be)\ncoupling condition (4.9). Moreover, (4.47) implies that there is a diagonal\nmatrix with positive entries d\u266fj = d\u266dj /qj\u266d such that Re D \u266f B \u266f > 0.

According to [Kre, ChPi] or\nLemma 8.4.2 in [M\u00e93], the e\u03baj,a are chosen as follows.\n1) If \u03bbj is of type I , then e\u03baj,1 = ej,1 is taken O(1), independent of \u03ba,\nand the e\u03baj,a for a \u2265 2 are chosen successively and depend on \u03ba. In particular,\nwhen \u03bdj is even, e\u03baj,2 \u2265 c\u03ba. When \u03bdj is odd and \u03b2j > 0, then qj\u266d < 0 and\nej,1 < 0; when \u03bdj \u2265 3, then e\u03baj,3 \u2265 c\u03ba.\n2) If \u03bbj is of type O, that is \u03bdj odd and qj\u266d > 0, one chooses e\u03baj,1 \u2265 c\u03ba\nand the other e\u03baj,a are chosen inductively.\n\u266d ) such\nBy assumption, there is a diagonal real matrix D \u266d = diag(DI\u266d , DO\nthat\n\u266d\n\u266d\nd\u266dj qj\u266d > 0, Re DI\u266d BI\u266d > 0, Re DO\nBO\n> 0.\nTherefore, there is a positive constant c such that if we choose e\u03baj,1 = cd\u266dj\nwhen \u03bbj is of type I and e\u03baj,1 = c\u03bad\u266dj when \u03bbj is of type I, the condition\n(5.12) is satisfied. Next, according to [Kre, ChPi, M\u00e93], we can choose the\ne\u03baj,a for a \u2265 2 such that the inequality (5.6) is also satisfied.\nRemark 5.1. The construction above shows that the conditions of Definition 4.22 are more or less necessary for the construction of K-families of\nsymmetrizers. First, the different magnitude in \u03ba of e\u03baj,1 for different types\nforces the decoupling (5.11), that it condition (4.9). Second, a spectral condition on B \u266f is not sufficient in general to insure the existence of a diagonal\nmatrix E \u266d such that (5.12) holds. This indicates that condition (4.47) is\nalso necessary for the construction above.\nb) Once the matrices Ej are chosen, the construction goes on as in\n[M\u00e9Zu1, M\u00e93]. We omit the details. By (4.13), Re (Ej Qj (p, \u03b6\u030c)) = 0. Next,\n53\n\n\fusing the implicit function theorem and the property that 1i Qk is real when\nek (p, \u03c4\u030c , \u03b7\u030c) is chosen so that such that\n\u03b3\u030c = 0, the real symmetric matrix E\ne\nRe (Ej + Ej )(Qj |\u03b3=0 ) = 0.\nSince Fj is real and skew symmetric, there holds Re \u2212 iFj Qj (p, \u03b6\u030c) =\nRe Fj Jj where Jj is the Jordan matrix in (4.13). One can choose Fj such\nthat\nRe (Fj Jj wj , wj ) \u2265 \u2212|wj,1 |2 + (C + 1)|wj\u2032 |2 .\nwhere C is the constant in (5.9). Adding to (5.9) implies (5.4).\nSimilarly, Re \u2212 iFej Qj (p, \u03b6\u030c) = Re Fej Jj and one can choose Fej such that\nRe (Fj Jj wj , wj ) \u2265 \u2212|wj,1 |2 + (C \u2032 + 1)|wj\u2032 |2 .\n\nwhere C \u2032 is the constant in (5.10), implying (5.5).\n\n5.2\n\nProof of Theorem 3.12\n\nWe now assume that the symmetry hypothesis (H1') is satisfied and that the\nroot (p, \u03c4\u030c , \u03be\u02c7 is totally non glancing. In [M\u00e9Zu2], symmetrizers for\u021ek (p, \u03b6\u030c, 0)\nare constructed. We show that they also symmetrize \u021ek (p, \u03b6\u030c, \u03c1) when \u03c1 > 0.\nIn [M\u00e9Zu2], it is proved that the nonglancing condition implies that the\nmultiplicity of \u03bck as an eigenvalue of H0 (p, \u03b6\u030c) = \u021e(p, \u03b6\u030c, 0) is equal to m.\nDenote by Vk the N \u00d7m sub-matrix of V which corresponds to the block \u021ek .\nTherefore, for (p, \u03b6\u030c, \u03c1) close to (p, \u03b6, 0), the corresponding invariant space of\n\u021eh is Ek (p, \u03b6\u030c, \u03c1) = Vk (p, \u03b6\u030c, \u03c1)Cm and\n(5.13)\n\nVk \u021ek = \u021eVk\nd\n\nRecall that E\u2212\nk (p, \u03b6\u030c, \u03c1) is the negative space of \u021ek for \u03b6\u030c \u2208 S + , \u03c1 \u2265 0 with\n\u03b3\u030c > 0 + \u03c1 > 0.\nLemma 5.2. ii) If (p, \u03c4 , \u03be) is totally incoming, then, for (p, \u03b6) in a neighm\nborhood of (p, \u03b6), E\u2212\nk (p, \u03b6) = C .\niii) If (p, \u03c4 , \u03be) is totally outgoing, then, for (p, \u03b6) in a neighborhood of\n(p, \u03b6), E\u2212\nk (p, \u03b6) = {0}.\nProof. The dimension is constant for \u03b3\u030c > 0 + \u03c1 > 0, and the result is proved\nin [M\u00e9Zu2] when \u03c1 = 0.\nBy assumption, there is a definite positive matrix S(p) such that the\nSAj are symmetric.\n54\n\n\fLemma 5.3.

According to (3.16), there holds\n\u021e(p, \u03b6\u030c, \u03c1) = H0 (p, \u03b6\u030c) + \u03c1H \u2032 (p, \u03b6\u030c, rho).\nUsing (5.13) and the definition (2.27) of H0 , one obtains the identity (5.15)\nwith\n(5.16)\n\nR1 = Vk\u2217 SVk ,\n\n(5.17)\n\nR2 = Vk\u2217 (Re SAd H \u2032 )Vk .\n\nBecause S is definite positive, R1 also has this property. Next, Lemma 4.23\nimplies that H \u2032 (p, \u03b6\u030c, 0) = \u2212H1 (p, \u03b6\u030c) with H1 given by (4.51). Since H0 (p, \u03b6\u030c) =\n\u03bck Id = \u2212i\u03bek Id on Ek (p, \u03b6\u030c, 0), there holds\n\u02c7\nH \u2032 (p, \u03b6\u030c, 0)Vk (p, \u03b6\u030c, 0) = \u2212A\u22121\nd (p)B(p, \u03be).\nTherefore, at the base point (p, cz, 0), there holds\nR2 (p, cz, 0) = Vk\u2217 (Re SB)Vk .\nThe assumption (H1') implies that SB is definite positive on the space\nEk (p, \u03b6\u030c, 0) = ker(A(p, \u03be\u030c) + \u03c4\u030c Id), implying that R2 is definite positive at\n(p, cz, 0), hence on a neighborhood of that point.\nThat \u03a3k (p, \u03b6, 0) is definite positive [resp. negative] when the mode is\ntotally incoming [resp. outgoing] is proved in [M\u00e9Zu2].\nWith Lemma 5.2, this implies that\n\u001a\n\u03a3k\nin the incoming case,\n\u03ba\n(5.18)\n\u03a3k =\n\u03ba\u03a3k\nin the outgoing case.\nare K-familes of symmetrizers for \u021ek .\n55\n\n\f6\n6.1\n\nFurther remarks and examples\nAdapted basis.

There are choices of a and \u0393, such that\ni) the inviscid problem (6.15) for \u03b5 = 0 with the boundary condition\n(6.20) is maximal striclty dissipative thus uniformly stable,\nii) the viscous problem with boundary conditions (6.17) is strongly unstable for small frequencies, in the sense that the Evans functions vanishes\nfor arbitrarily small frequencies \u03b6 with \u03b3 > 0.\nProof. The matrix\n(6.26)\n\nS=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n1 0\n,\n0 s\n\ns>0\n\nis a symmetrizer for the inviscid problem. If\n|c|2 < s,\n\n(6.27)\n\nthe boundary condition is strictly dissipative for S. This implies that the\nuniform Lopatinski condition is satisfied.\nWe consider frequencies \u03b6 = \u03c1\u03b6\u030c with \u03b6\u030c close to (\u22121, 1, 0) where H0 (\u03b6\u030c) = 0\nhas a double eigenvalue. More precisely we consider frequencies\n\u03b6 = (\u2212\u03c1 + \u03c12 \u03c4\u0302 , \u03c1, \u03c12 \u03b3\u0302).\n\n(6.28)\n\nIn this case, we see that G is a function of \u03c3\u0302 = \u03b3\u0302 + i\u03c4\u0302 and \u03c1, holomorphic\nin \u03c3\u0302, as well as V , P , H and c. Moreover\n(6.29)\n\nH(\u03b6) = \u2212\u03c12 (\u03c3\u0302A + A\u22121 B + O(\u03c1)) = \u03c12 \u0124(\u03c3\u0302, \u03c1).\n\nThe model operator is\n\u22121\n\n\u0124(\u03c3\u0302, 0) = \u2212\u03c3\u0302A \u2212 A\n\nB=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212\u03c3\u0302 \u2212 1 \u2212a\na\n\u03c3\u0302 + 1\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0124(1, 0) has one\u221aeigenvalue with positive real part, with eigenvector t (b, 1)\nwith b = (2 + 4 \u2212 a2 )/a (Note here the importance of the assumption\na 6= 0). Therefore, for \u03c3\u0302 close to 1 and \u03c1 small , the negative space of\n63\n\n\f\u0124(\u03c3\u0302, \u03c1) is generated by t (b(\u03c3\u0302, \u03c1), 1) where b is smooth and holomorphic in\n\u03c3\u0302 and b(1, 0) = b. Moreover\n(6.30)\n\n\u2202\u03c3\u0302 b(1, 0) =\n\n\u0001\n2\n1\n1+ \u221a\n6= 0.\n2\na\n4\u2212a\n\nComparing with (6.24), we see that the stability condition is violated at \u03b6\ngiven by (6.28), if and only if\n(6.31)\n\nb(\u03c3\u0302, \u03c1) = c(\u03b6) = \u0109(\u03c3\u0302, \u03c1).\n\nGiven a \u2208]0, 1[, we choose c = b and \u0393 such that the inviscid boundary\ncondition reads (6.20). Note that \u0109(\u03c3\u0302, 0) = c for all \u03c3\u0302. Thus the equation\n(6.31) holds at \u03c3\u0302 = 1 and \u03c1 = 0. Moreover, with (6.30), the implicit function\ntheorem shows that for \u03c1 > 0 small, there is \u03c3\u0302(\u03c1 close to 1 solution of (6.31),\nproviding frequencies \u03b6(\u03c1) = O(\u03c1) with \u03b3(\u03c1) \u223c \u03c12 > 0, where the stability\ncondition is violated.\n4. Smooth symmetrizers. We briefly discuss here the existence of smooth\nsymmetrizers for the hyperbolic operator \u021e (3.16). In the present case, we\ndeduce from (6.22) that in polar coordinates \u03b6 = \u03c1\u03b6\u030c, there holds\n(6.32)\n\n\u021e(\u03b6\u030c, \u03c1) = \u2212\u03c3\u030cA + \u03c1(\u03c3\u030c 2 \u2212 \u03b7\u030c 2 )AB + O(\u03c12 ),\n\n\u03c3\u030c = \u03b3\u030c + i(\u03c4\u030c + \u03b7\u030c).\n\nFix \u03b6\u030c = (1, \u22121, 0), which corresponds to a multiple root of the hyperbolic\npart. Then \u03c3\u030c = 0, and near (\u03b6\u030c, 0)\n(6.33)\n\n\u021e(\u03b6\u030c, \u03c1) = \u2212A(\u03c3\u030cId + \u03c1\u03b2(\u03b6\u030c)B) + O(\u03c12 )\n\nwith \u03b2(\u03b6\u030c) = 1. Dropping the \u02c7 , and changing \u03c1b to \u03c1, the matrix \u021e is a\nperturbation for (\u03c3, \u03c1) close to (0, 0) of the following canonical example\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 0\n1 0\n1 a\n(6.34)\n\u2202 +\u03c3\n+\u03c1\n, Re \u03c3 \u2265 0, \u03c1 \u2265 0,\n0 \u22121 x\n0 1\na 1\nNote that (6.29) derives from (6.33) choosing \u03c3\u030c = \u03c1\u03c3\u0302.\nDenote by E\u2212 the negative space of \u021e for Re \u03c3 + \u03c1 > 0. On can check\ndirectly on this example that the negative spaces have no limit as (\u03c3, \u03c1) \u2192\n(0, 0): the limits are different when \u03c1 = 0 and \u03c3 = 0, since the positive\nspaces of A and AB are different when a 6= 0.\nOn the other hand, blowing up once more the local coordinates near \u03b6\u030c,\nthat is taking polar coordinates (\u03c3, \u03c1) = r(\u03c3\u0302, \u03c1\u0302), is is clear from (6.33) that\nE\u2212 is a smooth function of (\u03c3\u0302, \u03c1\u0302).\n64\n\n\fIf \u03a3(\u03b6\u030c, \u03c1) is a smooth symmetrizer for \u021e, then (3.17) implies that \u03a3 =\n\u03a3(\u03b6\u030c, 0) must be a symmetrizer for \u2212(\u03c3A+\u03c1AB) for all \u03c3 and \u03c1, equivalently\nthat S = \u03a3A is a symmetrizer for (6.34), that is\n(6.35)\n\nS = S \u2217 \u226b 0,\n\nSA = AS,\n\nRe (SB) \u226b 0.\n\nThe first two conditions are satisfied if and only if S is diagonal and positive.\nMultiplying it by a positive factor, it must be of the form (6.26).\nThe third condition holds if and only if\ns > a2 (1 + s)2 /4.\nDenoting by smin (a) < 1 < smax (a) < \u221e the roots of the equation 4s =\na2 (1 + s2 ), the condition reads\n(6.36)\n\nsmin (a) < s < smax (a).\n\nThis shows that the choice of symmetrizers is much more limited in the\nviscous case compared to the inviscid one. In particular, when a is close to\n1, (6.36) forces to choose s in a small interval around 1.\nThe boundary condition (6.25) is strictly dissipative for \u03a3, then (6.20)\nis strictly dissipative for \u03a3. This holds if and only if s > |c|2 . Therefore:\nThere is a smooth symmetrizer \u03a3(\u03b6\u030c, \u03c1) for \u021e on a neighborhood of (\u03b6\u030c, 0),\nadapated to the boundary conditions (6.25) only if\n(6.37)\n\n7\n7.1\n\n|c|2 < smax (a).\n\nThe high-frequency analysis\nThe main high-frequency estimate\n\nThis section is devoted to an analysis of uniform maximal estimates for\nhigh-frequencies. We still assume that the Assumptions of Section 2 are\nsatisfied and we prove that the anticipated (2.58) are satisfied when the\nuniform spectral stability conditions are satisfied, under the following additional structural assumptions which strengthens (H3): it means first that\nthe block L11 is hyperbolic with constant multiplicity with respect to time,\nand second that it is totally incoming our outgoing.\n\n65\n\n\fAssumption 7.1. (H5) For all u \u2208 U \u2217 and \u03be \u2208 Rd \\{0}, the eigenvalues of\n11\nA (u, \u03be) are real, semi-simple and have constant multiplicities .\n(H6) L11 (u, \u2202) is also hyperbolic with respect to the normal direction dxd .\nFor Navier-Stokes and MHD equations and in many examples L11 is a\ntransport field\nL11 = \u2202t +\n\n(7.1)\n\nd\nX\n\naj (u)\u2202j\n\nj=1\n\nand the condition reduces to ad (u) 6= 0 for u \u2208 U \u2217 , that is to Assumption 2.6,\nwhich means inflow or outflow boundary conditions. The hyperbolicity condition (H6) in the normal direction is important as shown on an example\nbelow. On the other hand the constant multiplicity condition (H5) is more\ntechnical, and could be replaced by symmetry conditions: this is briefly\ndiscussed in Remark 7.12.\nWe consider the linearized equation (2.21):\n(7.2)\n\n\u2202z u = G(z, \u03b6)u + f,\n\n\u0393(\u03b6)u(0) = g\n\nwith u = t (u1 , u2 , u3 ), f = t (f 1 , f 2 , f 3 ), \u0393 as in (2.56) and g = t (g1 , g2 , g3 ).\nTheorem 7.2. With assumptions as indicated above, assume that the uniform spectral stability condition is satisfied for high frequencies. Then there\nd+1\nare \u03c11 > 0 and C such that for all \u03b6 \u2208 R+ with |\u03b6| \u2265 \u03c11 , the solutions of\n(7.2) satisfy\n(1 + \u03b3)ku1 kL2 + \u039bku2 kL2 + ku3 kL2\n1\n\n(7.3)\n\n1\n\n1\n\n+(1 + \u03b3) 2 |u1 (0)| + \u039b 2 |u2 (0)| + \u039b\u2212 2 |u3 (0)|\n\n\u2264 C kf 1 kL2 + kf 2 kL2 + \u039b\u22121 kf 3 kL2\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\n1\n1\n1\n+ C (1 + \u03b3) 2 |g1 | + \u039b 2 |g2 | + \u039b\u2212 2 |g3 | .\n\nHigh frequencies require a particular analysis for two reasons. First, the\nsplitting hyperbolic vs parabolic is quite different in this regime and second the conjugation operator \u03a6 of Lemma 2.10 is not uniform for large \u03b6.\nThe analysis is made in [M\u00e9Zu1] for full viscosities and Dirichlet boundary\nconditions. For partial viscosities and shocks, that is for transmission condition, the problem is solved in [GMWZ4]. The presentation below is more\nsystematic and allows for more general boundary conditions of the form\n(2.10).\n66\n\n\fWe now explain the general strategy of the proof. We use the notations\nkuksc = (1 + \u03b3)ku1 kL2 + \u039bku2 kL2 + ku3 kL2 ,\n\n(7.4)\n\nkf k\u2032sc = kf 1 kL2 + kf 2 kL2 + \u039b\u22121 kf 3 kL2 ,\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n|u(0)|sc = (1 + \u03b3) 2 |u1 (0)| + \u039b 2 |u2 (0)| + \u039b\u2212 2 |u3 (0)|,\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n|g|sc = (1 + \u03b3) 2 |g1 | + \u039b 2 |g2 | + \u039b\u2212 2 |g3 |.\n\n1) The main step in the proof of the theorem is to separate off the\nincoming and outgoing components of u. This is done using a change of\nvariables \u00fb = V \u22121 (z, \u03b6)u which transforms the equation (7.2) to\n(7.5)\n\n\u2202z \u00fb = \u011c(z, \u03b6)\u00fb + f\u02c6,\n\n\u0393\u0302(\u03b6)\u00fb(0) = g.\n\nThere are norms similar to (7.4) for \u00fb and f\u02c6 as well; with little risk of\nconfusion, we use here the same notations.

(The norms are defined, identifying \u00fb\u2212 \u2208 CNb to\n(0, \u00fb\u2212 ) \u2208 CN etc). As a result, with (7.9), this implies that if \u00fb is a solution\nof (7.5), then\n(7.12)\n(7.13)\n\nk\u00fb+ ksc + |\u00fb+ (0)| \u2264 Ckf\u02c6ksc + \u03b5(\u03b6)k\u00fbksc ,\nk\u00fb\u2212 ksc \u2264 Ckf\u02c6ksc + \u03b5(\u03b6)k\u00fbksc + C|\u00fb\u2212 (0)|,\n\n3) We show that the estimates above imply that if the uniform spectral\nstability condition is satisfied, then the solutions of (7.5) satisfy for |\u03b6| large\nenough\n\u0001\n(7.14)\nk\u00fbksc + |\u00fb(0)|sc \u2264 C kf\u02c6ksc + |g|sc\n\nimplying that the solutions of (7.2) satisfy\n(7.15)\n\nkuksc + |u(0)|sc \u2264 C kf ksc + |g|sc\n\n\u0001\n\nthat is (7.3).\n\u2022 Indeed, by definition, h \u2208 E\u2212 (\u03b6) if and only if there is u solution of\n\u2202z u = Gu with u(0) = h.

The spectrum of G\u0303p is the union of the spectra of G11\np and Pp . By\nd\n\nhomogeneity, it suffices to consider \u03b6 \u2208 S + .\n11 since A11 (i\u03be + G11 (u, \u03b6)) = L11 (u, \u03b3 + i\u03c4, i\u03b7, i\u03be).\na) G11\np\np is related to L\nd\n11\nBy Assumption (H3), L is hyperbolic in the time direction, hence G11\np has\nno eigenvalues on the imaginary axis when \u03b3 > 0; moreover, the boundary\nis noncharacteristic for L11 by Assumption 2.6, implying that the number\nof eigenvalues of G11\np in {Re \u03bc < 0} is equal to the number of positive\n,\nthat\nis is N+1 .\neigenvalues of A11\nd\nNext, note that\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0\n|\u03b6|Id\n22\nPp =\n|\u03b6|\u22121 G32\nG33\np\np\n\nThus, i\u03be is an eigenvalue of Pp22 if and only if 0 is an eigenvalue of B 22 (\u03b7, \u03be),\nwhich is impossible by (H2) if \u03b7 6= 0. Thus, the eigenvalues of Pp22 are\nnot purely imaginary when \u03b7 6= 0. Moreover, the number of eigenvalues in\n{Re \u03bc < 0} is N \u2032 (see [M\u00e9Zu1]). This finishes the proof of i).\n\n33\n22\nb) If \u03b7 = 0, G32\np and Gp vanish, hence the spectrum of Pp is {0}. On\n11\n11\nthe other hand 0 is not an eigenvalue of Gp = \u2212(\u03b3 + i\u03c4 )(Ad )\u22121 A11\n0 since\n11 are invertible and |\u03b3 + i\u03c4 | = |\u03b6| = 1.\nand\nA\nA11\n0\nd\nIf \u03b3 = 0 and \u03b7 6= 0, the eigenvalues of Pp22 are not in iR. On the other\nhand, by Assumption (H6) the eigenvalues of G11\np are purely imaginary, thus\n11\n22\nPp and Gp have no common eigenvalue. This finishes the proof of ii).\n\nThe analysis in a purely \"elliptic\" zone {\u03b3 \u2265 \u03b4|\u03b6| and |\u03b7| \u2265 \u03b4|\u03b6|} with\n\u03b4 > 0, is easy, see below.

By homogeneity, it is sufficient to construct Wp21 for |\u03b6| = 1. By\nLemma 7.3, for \u03b6 \u2208 S d+1 \u2229 C\u03b4 and u \u2208 U0\u2217 , the spectra of G11\np (u, \u03b6) and\nPp22 (u, \u03b6) do not intersect, so that the linear system of equation\n22\nXG11\np (u, \u03b6) \u2212 Pp (u, \u03b6)X = Y\n\nhas a unique solution X = X (u, \u03b6)Y .

Therefore, (7.34) implies that V 12 also vanishes\nwhen \u03b7 = 0 and hence\nV 12 (z, \u03b6) = O(|\u03b7|/|\u03b6|).\n\n(7.36)\nWith these notations,\n\uf8eb\nId\n\u22121\n\uf8ed\nVI (z, \u03b6) = |\u03b6| Vp21\nVp31\n\nlet\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n0 0\nId 0 \uf8f8 ,\n0 Id\n\n\uf8f6\nId Vp12 |\u03b6|\u22121 Vp13\n\uf8f8\n0\nVII (z, \u03b6) = \uf8ed 0 Id\n0\n0\nId\n\nand V = VI VII .

If \u2202\u03bed \u03bbj (u, \u03b7, \u03be d ) = 0, then the equation \u03c4 + \u03bb(\u03b7, \u03bed ) = 0 would have\ncomplex roots in \u03bed for some \u03c4 close to \u03c4 = \u2212\u03bbj (u, \u03b7, \u03be d ) (recall that \u03bbj is\nreal analytic). Thus hyperbolicity in the normal direction prevents glancing.\nMoroever, by continuity the sign of \u2202\u03bed \u03bbj (u, \u03b7, \u03bed ) is constant for all \u03bed \u2208 R\nwhen \u03b7 6= 0. Thus the functions \u03bed 7\u2192 \u03bbj (u, \u03b7, \u03bed ) are monotone and tend\nto infinity as \u03bed tends to \u00b1\u221e. Since \u03bbj 6= \u03bbk when j 6= k, they must be all\nincreasing or all decreasing. This remains true for \u03b7 = 0 by continuity.\nAccording to the terminology of Section 4, we will say that the hyperbolic\nblock L11 is incoming [resp. outgoing] when the derivatives \u2202\u03bed \u03bbj (u, \u03be) are\npositive [resp. negative].\nCorollary 7.9. i) The matrix G11\np (u, \u03b6) has no purely imaginary eigenvalues\nwhen \u03b3 > 0. They are all lying in {Re \u03bc > 0} if the 11-block is outgoing and\nin {Re \u03bc < 0} if it is incoming.\nii) Near points \u03b6 with \u03b3 = 0, G11\np (u, \u03b6) has semi-simple eigenvalues\n\u03bcj (u, \u03b6) of constant multiplicity \u03bdj , which are purely imaginary when \u03b3 = 0.\nMoreover, \u2202\u03b3 Re \u03bcj > 0 when the 11-block is outgoing and \u2202\u03b3 Re \u03bcj < 0 when\nthe 11-block is incoming.\nProof. Note that \u03bc is an eigenvalue of G11\np (u, \u03b6) if and only if \u2212\u03c4 + i\u03b3 is an\n11\n\neigenvalue of A (u, \u03b7, \u03be) with \u03be = \u2212i\u03bc.\nConsider the equations in \u03bed : \u03c4 + \u03bbj (u, \u03b7, \u03bed ) = 0. Since \u03bbj is strictly\nmonotone and tends to infinity at both infinity, it always have a unique\nsolution, \u03c8j (u, \u03b7, \u03c4 ) and \u2202\u03c4 \u03c8j has the same sign as \u2212\u2202\u03bed \u03bbj . This solution extends analytically for Im \u03c4 small. This yields distinct eigenvalues\n\u03bcj (u, \u03b6) = i\u03c8j (u, \u03b7, \u03c4 \u2212 i\u03b3) of G11\np for \u03b6 close to the real domain. In particular \u2202\u03b3 \u03bcj = \u2202\u03c4 \u03c8j and the eigenvalues all lie in {Re \u03bc > 0} if the 11-block is\noutgoing and in {Re \u03bc > 0} if it is incoming.\n11\nThe kernel of G11\np \u2212 \u03bcj is the kernel of A \u2212 \u03bbj , thus has dimension equal\nto the multiplicity of \u03bbj . Since these dimensions add up to N 1 , this shows\n76\n\n\fthat G11\np has only semi-simple eigenvalues of constant multiplicity, which all\nlie in a given half space when \u03b3 > 0.\nHyperbolicity of L11 implies that G11\np (u, \u03b6) has no purely imaginary\neigenvalues when \u03b3 6= 0 and by continuity they all lie in the same half\nspace.\nNext we need more information on the zero-th order correction of \u011c 11 .\nFrom (7.20) (7.21) and (7.22) we see that\n\u0001\n(7.44)\n\u011c 11 (z, \u03b6) \u2212 (V \u22121 \u2202z V)11 = G11\np (w(z), \u03b6) + E(z, \u03b6),\n\nwhere E \u2208 \u03930 . Denote its principal part by Ep . Its limit at z = \u221e is\n(7.45)\n\n21\n13\n31\nEp (p, \u03b6) = |\u03b6|\u22121 G12\np (p, \u03b6)Vp (p, \u03b6)Gp (p, \u03b6)Vp (p, \u03b6)\n\nwhere p = limz\u2192+\u221e w(z) and Vp21 (p, \u03b6), Vp31 (p, \u03b6) denote the end points of\nVp21 and Vp31 , that is the solutions of the intertwining relations (7.32) (7.33)\nwith matrices Gpab replaced bay their endpoint values Gab\np (p, \u03b6). The next\nresult is crucial and follows from the genuine coupling condition (H4).\nProposition 7.10. Fix \u03b6 with |\u03b6| = 1 and \u03b3 = 0. For \u03b6 in a neighborhood of\n\u03b6, consider a basis where G11 (u, \u03b6) has the block diagonal form diag(\u03bcj Id\u03bdj ).\nDenote by Ej,k (u, \u03b6) the corresponding blocks of E is this basis. Then, for\nu \u2208 U the eingenvalues of the diagonal blocks Re Ej,j have a positive [resp.\nnegative] real part if the 11-block is outgoing [resp. incoming].\nProof. It is sufficient to prove the positivity at \u03b6. Suppose that \u03b3 = 0, denote\nby \u03c6j,p with p \u2208 {1, . . . , \u03bdj } a basis of eigenvectors of G11 (u, \u03b6). Fix j and\nset \u03bed = \u2212i\u03bcj (u, \u03b6) \u2208 R, \u03be = (\u03b7, \u03bed ). Then the \u03c6j,p are right eigenvectors of\n11\nA (u, \u03be) associated to the eigenvalue \u2212\u03c4 = \u03bbj (u, \u03be).\n11\nConsider left eigenvectors lj,p of A (u, \u03be), dual to the \u03c6j,p . Then, the left\n11\n1\neigenvectors of G11\np (u, \u03b6) associated to \u03bcj are \u03b2j lj Ad with \u03b2j = \u2202\u03bed \u03bbj (u, \u03b7, \u03be,\nwee Lemma 4.19.

We prove the estimate for \u03b6 in a conical neighborhood of \u03b6. Suppose first that \u03b3 = 0 (the most difficult case). By\nCorollary 7.9 there is a matrix V 11 (z, \u03b6) homogeneous of degree 0 such that\n(V 11 )\u22121 Gp11 V 11 = diag(\u03bcj (w(z), \u03b6)Id\u03bdj . Setting \u00fb1 = V 11 u1 transforms the\nequation to\n(7.50)\n\ne 1 + f1\n\u2202z u1 = (diag(\u03bcj (w(z), \u03b6)Id\u03bdj + E)u\n\nwith Ee = E \u2212 (V 11 )\u22121 \u2202z V 11 \u2208 \u03930 , whose principal part Eep has the same end\npoint Ep (p, \u03b6) as Ep .\nAs usual, since the \u03bcj are pairwise distinct, there is a new change u1 =\n11 \u2208 \u0393\u22121 , such that the resulting system has the same\n(Id + V\u22121 )\u01691 with V\u22121\nform with the additional property that the zero-th order part is also block\ndiagonal, so that Eep = diag(Ej,j ) and the end points of the blocks Ej,j are\nEj,j introduced in Proposition 7.10.\nThe term (Ee \u2212 Eep )u is O(|\u03b6|\u22121 |u|), is incorporated to f 1 and finally\nabsorbed from the right to the left of the inequality by choosing |\u03b6| large\nenough. This reduces the proof to the case where the equation reads\n(7.51)\n\n\u2202z \u00fb1 = \u03bcj (w(z), \u03b6)\u00fb1 + Ej,j (\u03b6)\u00fb1 + Fj,j (z, \u03b6)\u00fb1 + f\u02c61\n\nwith |Fj,j | \u2264 C0 e\u2212\u03b8z .\nConsider the outgoing case. Then, Corollary 7.9 implies that there is\na constant c > 0 such that Re \u03bcj (u, \u03b6) \u2265 c\u03b3. Moreover, Proposition 7.10\nimplies that the eigenvalues of Ej,j have a positive real part. Thus, there is\na positive definite (constant) matrix S(\u03b6) geId such\nR z that Re SEj,j is definite\npositive, say Re SEj,j \u2265 Id. Introduce a = C0 |S| 0 e\u2212\u03b8s ds such that \u2202z a \u2265\n|SFj,j | and a is bounded in L\u221e uniformly with respect to \u03b6. Therefore,\nmultiplying the equation by e2a(z) S and taking the L2 scalar product with\n\u00fb1 implies that\n(1 + c\u03b3)kea \u00fb1 k2L2 + |\u00fb1 (0)|2 \u2264 Ckea \u00fb1 kL2 kea f\u02c61 kL2\nwhich implies (7.49). The proof in the incoming case is similar.\nb) Suppose next that \u03b3 = 0. Consider again the outgoing case. Then,\nthe eigenvalues of G11\np satisfy Re \u03bc \u2265 c|\u03b6| in a conical neighborhood of \u03b6.\nThis is the classical \"elliptic\" case. There is a symmetric definite positive\nmatrix S(u, \u03b6) \u2208 \u03930 such that Re SG11 \u2265 c|\u03b6|Id and usual integrations by\nparts imply that\nc|\u03b6|k\u00fb1 k2L2 + |\u00fb1 (0)|2 \u2264 Ck\u00fb1 kL2 kf\u02c61 kL2 + C1 k\u00fb1 k2L2\n79\n\n\fwhere C1 involve estimates of the zero-th order terms, which include \u2202z S(w(z), \u03b6).\nThis term is eliminated choosing |\u03b6| large enough. The proof in the incoming\ncase is similar.\nRemark 7.12. The proof above contains two ingredients. First, the 11block is totally incoming or totally outgoing, in analogy with the terminology of Section 4. Thus the decoupling incoming/outgoing is trivial. More\ngenerally, this could be replaced by a decoupling condition in the spirit\nof Section 4. For instance, for shocks, such a decoupling is immediate in\n[GMWZ4] corresponding to equations on each side of the front. Next, we\nconstruct symmetrizers for the incoming and outgoing components. There\nwe use the genuine coupling condition. If the eigenvalues are not of constant\nmultiplicity one can introduce adapted bases or use symmetry also in the\nspirit of Section 4.\n7.3.3\n\nAbout Assumption (H6)\n\nWe show on an example that hyperbolicity in the normal direction is crucial\nin the proof of estimates of the form (7.49). Suppose that the L11 - block\nreads\n\u001a\n\u2202t u \u2212 \u2202y u + \u2202x v,\n(7.52)\n\u2202t v + \u2202y v + \u2202x u.\nThen, on the Fourier side, the 11 equation will be of the form\n\u001a\n(i(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03b7) + \u03b3)u + \u2202z v + a(z)u = f,\n(7.53)\n(i(\u03c4 + \u03b7) + \u03b3)v + \u2202x u + a(z)v = g,\nand the only information we have from the genuine coupling condition is\nthat a is positive at z = +\u221e. Suppose that a(z0 ) < 0 for some z0 > 0.\nThen glancing waves for (7.52) will propagate parallel to the boundary and\nthus may remain in a region where a is negative and thus may never be\ndamped. This is illustrated by choosing \u03c4 = \u03b7, large, \u03b3 = \u2212a(z0 ) > and\n1\n\nu\u03c4 (z) = \u03c7(\u03c4 3 (z \u2212 z0 )),\n\nv\u03c4 (z) =\n\n\u2212\u2202z u\u03c4\n2i\u03c4 + \u03b3 + a\n\nwith \u03c7 \u2208 C0\u221e (R). Then (7.53) is satisfied with f = (a(z) \u2212 a(z0 ))u\u03c4 + \u2202z v\u03c4\n1\nand g = 0. Moreover, kf kL2 = O(\u03c4 \u2212 3 )kukL2 and u(0) = v(0) = 0, showing\nthat no estimate of the form (7.49) can be valid.\n\n80\n\n\f7.4\n7.4.1\n\nProof of Theorem 7.2\nIn the cone C\u03b4\n\nWe consider now the equation (7.39) and briefly recall the results from\n[M\u00e9Zu1].

Assume that 0 < |v| =\n6 c.\ni) On the manifold \u03be \u00d7 v = 0, the multiple eigenvalues are nonglancing\nif and only if u3 6= \u00b1v3 . In this case, they are totally nonglancing.\nii) On the manifold \u03be * v = 0, the multiple eigenvalues are non glancing if\nand only if u3 6= 0, u3 6= \u00b1v3 and u3 6= \u00b1\u03b4v3 . They are totally nonglancing\nwhen |u3 | > |v3 |.\n\nProof. By (8.11), on \u03be \u00d7 v = 0, with j = s when |v| < c and j = f when\n|v| > c, there holds\n\u2202\u03be3 \u03bb\u00b1j = \u2202\u03be3 \u03bb\u00b12 = u3 \u00b1 v3 .\nThis implies i).\nIn addition, \u2202\u03be3 \u03bb0 = u3 , \u2202\u03be3 \u03bb\u00b12 = u3 \u00b1v3 , and by (8.12) \u2202\u03be3 \u03bb\u00b11 = u3 \u00b1\u03b4v3\non the manifold \u03be v\u0307 = 0. This implies ii).\nNext we study the viscous coupling of vectors ej at geometrically regular modes. In the variables (\u03c1\u0307/\u03c1, u\u0307, v\u0307), the system (8.7) is symmetric,\nwith symmetrizer S = diag(c2 , Id, Id), and the viscosity matrix is B(\u03be) =\n|\u03be|2 diag(0, \u03bdId/\u03c1, \u03bcId). The basis (8.13) is orthonormal for S. Therefore,\naccording to the general rule (6.9), the matrix B \u266f is symmetric with nondiagonal entries\n\u266f\n\u266f\n\u266f\nB0,\u00b11\n= B0,\u00b12\n= B\u00b11,\u00b12\n= 0,\n\n(8.15)\n\n\u266f\nB1,\u22121\n=\n\n\u03bd\n\u03b42 \u03bc\n\u2212 ,\n2\n2\u03c1\n\n\u266f\nB2,\u22122\n=\n\n86\n\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\n\u2212 .\n2 2\u03c1\n\n\fWhen |u3 | < |v3 |, then one of the eigenvalue \u03bb\u00b12 is incoming and the other\none outgoing (depending on the sign of v3 ). Therefore, if \u03bc \u2212 \u03bd/\u03c1, the\n\u266f\ncoupling coefficient B2,\u22122\ndoes not vanish. Summing up, we have proved:\nLemma 8.3. If |u3 | < |v3 |, and \u03bd 6= \u03c1\u03bc, then the decoupling condition (4.9)\nis not satisfied at modes where \u03be * v = 0.\nRemark 8.4. The decoupling of the mode \u03bb0 from the other ones reflects\nthat the constraint (8.2) is propagated by the viscous equation as well. The\nother partial decoupling observed above depend on the particular choice of\nthe viscosity matrices and disappear for general B.\n\n8.4\n\nShocks\n\nConsider an inviscid planar shock. We suppose that the front is x3 = \u03c3t\nand denote by (\u03c1\u2212 , u\u2212 , H \u2212 ) and (\u03c1+ , u+ , H + ) the states on the left and on\nthe right respectively. All the analysis of the preceding section is valid, if\nwe change u3 to u3 \u2212 \u03c3.\nThe jump conditions are deduced from the conservative form of the equations:\n\uf8f1\n[\u03c1(u3 \u2212 \u03c3)] = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 [\u03c1u(u \u2212 \u03c3)] + r p + 1 |H|2 \u2212 [H H] = 0,\n3\n3\n3\n2\n(8.16)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n[(u3 \u2212 \u03c3)H] \u2212 [H3 u] = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 [H ] = 0,\n3\n\nwhere r3 = t (0, 0, 1). The last jump condition comes from the constraint\nequation (8.2). Apparently this system of 8 scalar equations is too large.\nHowever, projecting the third equation in the normal direction yields \u03c3[H3 ] =\n0 which is implied by the last equation. This shows that (8.16) is made of\n7 independent equations, as expected. Denoting by utg and Htg the tangential part of u and H, that is their orthogonal projection on r3\u22a5 , (8.16) is\nequivalent to\n\uf8f1\n[\u03c1(u3 \u2212 \u03c3)] = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\uf8f2\n1\n2\n(8.17)\n[\u03c1u(u3 \u2212 \u03c3)] + r3 p + |H| \u2212 [H3 H] = 0,\n\uf8f4\n2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n[(u3 \u2212 \u03c3)Htg ] \u2212 [H3 utg ] = 0, [H3 ] = 0.\n87\n\n\f1.

Therefore :\nProposition 8.5. For extreme Lax shocks, the assumptions of Theorem 1.1\nare satisfied.\n2. Slow Lax' shocks. Consider a shock associated to one of the middle\neigenvalue \u03bb\u00b1s .

Suppose that\n(8.21)\n\nu3 \u2208\n/ {\u2212c, 0, +c}.\n\nThen, for U in a neighborhood of U , the boundary x3 = 0 is non characteristic for the hyperbolic linearized equation and the eigenvalues \u03bb\u00b13 are simple.\nMoreover, for all \u03be 6= 0, the multiple eigenvalue \u03bb0 is totally nonglancing at\nU.\n88\n\n\fReferences\n[ChPi]\n\nChazarain J. and Piriou, A., Introduction to the Theory of Linear Partial Differential Equations, North Holland, Amsterdam,\n1982.\n\n[Gue]\n\nGu\u00e8s, O., Perturbations visqueuses de probl\u00e8mes mixtes hyperboliques et couches limites, Ann.Inst.Fourier., 45 (1995) pp\n973\u20131006.\n\n[GrGu]\n\nGrenier, E., Gu\u00e8s, 0., Boundary layers for viscous perturbations of noncharacteristic quasilinear hyperbolic problems,\nJ.Diff.Equ., 143 (1998) pp 110\u2013146.\n\n[GMWZ1]\n\nGues, O., Metivier, G., Williams, M., and Zumbrun, K., Multidimensional viscous shocks I: degenerate symmetrizers and long\ntime stability, Journal of the AMS, 18 (2005), pp 61-120\n\n[GMWZ2]\n\nGu\u00e8s, O., M\u00e9tivier, G., Williams, M., and Zumbrun, K., Multidimensional viscous shocks II: the small viscosity problem,\nComm.
