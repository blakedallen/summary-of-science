Despite the impressive experimental and theoretical results obtained during last\ndecade due to, mainly, experiments at the electron-proton collider HERA, there still exist\nuncertainties in the interpretation of data on the charm production in hadron-hadron and\nlepton-hadron collisions. These uncertainties relate to the details of the quark structure of\nhadrons, in first turn the proton. One of these problems is the problem of \"intrinsic charm\"\n(IC) of the proton [1], i.e., the question about the presence in the wave function of the hadron\na visible (\u2248 1%) non-perturbative admixture of the charmed quarks with hard, \"valence-like\"\ndistribution over their longitudinal momenta. Investigations at HERA have been performed at\nsmall values of x, where the main contribution comes from the photon-gluon fusion mechanism\n(PGF). But small values of the variable x describe the space scales much greater, than the\nproton size and, therefore, the study of those kinematical regions gives information about the\nstructure of the QCD vacuum itself, rather than about the internal structure of the proton.\nTo understand the internal structure of the proton it is necessary to study the proton charmed\nstructure function at large values of x. But the geometries of ZEUS and H1 set-ups do not\nallow to study efficiently the charm production processes in the very forward region at relatively\nsmall momentum transfers, where the cross-section of the ep scattering is maximal. The planned\nHERA upgrade will increase few times the collider luminosity and, perhaps, this increase will\nallow to collect sufficient statistics at large momentum transfers for the experimental study of\nthe charm production in the range of large values of x. But at present this problem is not well\ninvestigated.\nThe theoretical consideration of the \"intrinsic charm\" problem is based on the following\nsimple points. The wave function of the proton can be expanded over the colourless eigenstates\nof free Hamiltonian |uud >, |uudg >, |uudq q\u0304 >, . . .. During sufficiently long time the proton\ncan consist of Fock states of an arbitrary complexity, including a pair of charmed quarks. In the\nproton rest frame the life-time of such a fluctuation \u03c4 has the order of the nuclear time \u223c Rh ,\nwhere Rh is the hadron size. Charmed quarks are heavy objects and their life-time is much less\nthan that of light partons. Therefore, in average, the admixture of the heavy quark pairs in the\nproton wave function is to be small, \u223c (mq /mQ )2 , that is, by factor \u223c 102 less than life-time\nof a fluctuation containing light partons only. Additionally, because of c quarks are massive\nit turns out that their momentum distributions are to be much harder than the distribution\nof the light sea partons [1, 2]. The existence of the fluctuation, containing heavy quarks is a\nnatural consequence of the field theory. But the important guess is that quantum fluctuations\nof the hadron wave function containing charmed quarks appear due to self-interaction of the\ncolour field, ensuring the non-perturbative origin of the intrinsic charm distribution. In this\ncase the structure of the hadron Fock states with charm can be considered independently of\nhard interactions.\nEstimating the level of the charmed quarks admixture in the proton, they usually suppose\nthat experimental indications on the intrinsic charm exist in \u03bcp collisions [3] and in hadronic\ncollisions data [4, 5], where deviations from the photon-gluon and parton-parton fusion models\npredictions have been observed. But the experimental situation is sufficiently uncertain. The\noriginal work [1] was motivated by ISR data [4], where a very large yield of the charm had been\n2\n\n\fobtained, at least, order of magnitude larger than it was expected in the model of the partonparton fusion. A critical comparison of the ISR results against the contemporary fixed-target\ndata can be found in the review [6]. Later experiments (though carried out at lower energies),\ndid not contradict so dramatically to the theoretical expectations (see, e.g., [7]). In paper [8] an\nattempt has been taken to co-ordinate the ISR data with the parton-parton fusion predictions.\nThere has been considered the process of the \"charm excitation\", based on the guess about 0.5%\nadmixture of the charmed quarks in the proton, which admixture leads to the hard scattering\nof the charmed quarks. Due to large cross section of the hard scattering (strictly speaking, this\ncross section diverges) and to its stronger dependence on reaction energy, it was shown [8], that\nISR data can be described in framework of the charm excitation model. At the same time this\nmodel does not predict visible contribution in the charm yield at lower energies.\nExperimental data on longitudinal distributions of charmed particles and on asymmetry of\ntheir production can be reproduced with acceptable accuracy without the \"intrinsic charm\"\nhypothesis, only by reasonable variation of parameters of string hadronization model [9, 10].\nThe interpretation of the data on J/\u03c8 particle production is also contradictory. In the\nexperiment NA3 [5] in pion-nuclear collisions at energy 280 GeV definite indications on the\npresence of an additional mechanism of hard J/\u03c8 production were obtained. This additional\ncontribution at the level of 20% of the total of J/\u03c8 production cross section is well described\nby the modified model of the intrinsic charm [2], but the guess about so large contribution does\nnot look very realistic. It was noted in papers [11, 12], that intrinsic charm can also explain a\nlarger than it was expected yield of fast correlated pairs of J/\u03c8 particles, as well as anomalous\npolarization of J/\u03c8's, probably observed in NA3 experiment. At the same time predictions\nof the intrinsic charm model directly contradict to data on J/\u03c8 production in proton-nuclear\ncollisions at energy 800 GeV [13] (see [14]).\nNote, that the admixture of the charmed quarks in the proton at level of 1% leads to total\ncross section of charm production in nucleon collisions of order of few hundreds microbarn in\nconflict to the bulk of the experimental data on open charm production in hadronic interactions.\nDoing any theoretical analysis of the hadronic data it is necessary to keep in mind, that\nthe main contribution in the charm production in hadronic collisions is led by the gluon-gluon\nfusion gg \u2192 cc\u0304. At the same time the direct measurements of the gluon distributions are\nimpossible. To extract the gluon distributions from data they use either charm production\ncalculations based on the gluon-gluon and photon-gluon mechanisms, which contributes in the\nsmall xF range, or sufficiently involved methods based on the guess that the main contribution\nin the QCD evolution is driven by the gluons. Due to this fact the extraction of an additional\nmechanism of charm production at level of (0.5 \u2212 1)% can not be reliable.\nIn fact, the only experimental data, which allow to perform sufficiently reliable check of\nthe presence of the intrinsic charm in the proton are the EMC measurements of the charm\nphotoproduction in \u03bc+ p collisions at energy 250 GeV. In early papers on the EMC data analysis\nthey used old, harder parametrizations of the gluon distributions in the proton. In particular,\nin the first analysis carried out by EMC the scaling gluon distribution G(x) \u223c (1\u2212x)5 has been\nused, which gave the deviation from the photon-gluon mechanism predictions at level of about\n0.3% with sufficiently large error of this value. Modern and, as a rule, softer parametrizations\nof the gluon distribution, lead, naturally, to larger contribution of the intrinsic charm in the\nEMC data [15, 16, 2]. Thus, the intrinsic charm contribution, extracted from analysis of the\nEMC data varies from 0.3% [3, 17] to, approximately, 0.9% [16, 2]. In paper [16], where the\n3\n\n\fmost careful calculations of the contribution of the photon-gluon fusion have been done, it\nwas shown that at small energy transfers the intrinsic charm contribution is absent within the\nexperimental errors.\nDue to existence of the hadronic structure of photon [18, 19, 20] the total charm production\ncross section in the leptoproduction should also include the interactions of the partons from the\nvirtual photon with the proton. Such a contribution of the hard scattering of c quarks from the\nvirtual J/\u03c8 meson calculated in framework of the vector dominance model in [21], allowed to\nreproduce with a good accuracy the results of ZEUS experiment on D \u2217 mesons production at\nlarge transverse momenta. Despite the fact that the scattering processes are to the second order\nby \u03b1s , they can produce quite visible effects due to divergence of the parton-parton scattering\ncross sections at small angles. Therefore, it is natural to expect, that the hadronic component\nof the resolved photon can also give a visible contribution in the charmed structure function,\nmeasured by EMC in the range Q2 \u2265 40 GeV2 , where the indications on the deviation of the\nexperimental data from the photon-gluon predictions exist.\nIn present work we have calculated the contribution of the hadronic component of the\nphoton and the contribution of the standard mechanism of the photon-gluon fusion in the\ncharmed structure function, measured in EMC experiment. The calculations performed in\npresent work show, that it is not necessary to consider the intrinsic charm admixture in the\nproton to interpret the EMC data.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nThe basic outline of the model\nCharm in the hadronic component of the photon\n\nIn the deeply inelastic processes with hadrons the measured physical quantity is the hadron\nstructure function F2 (x, Q2 ). The charm production cross section in electroproduction Lp \u2192 c,\nexpressed through the structure function F2c (x, Q2 ) is:\n\n\u0003 c\n2\u03c0\u03b12 \u0002\n2\nd\u03c3(lp \u2192 c) =\nF2 (x, Q2) dx dQ2 ,\n1\n+\n(1\n\u2212\ny)\n4\nxQ\n\n(1)\n\nand in the equivalent photon approximation [22] it can be expressed through the cross section\nof the \u03b3p interaction \u03c3(\u03b3p \u2192 c) and the flux of the equivalent photons n\u03b3 (x, Q2 ) as:\n\nd\u03c3(lp \u2192 c) = dn\u03b3 (x, Q2) \u03c3(\u03b3p \u2192 c) ,\n2\n\ndn\u03b3 (x, Q )\n\n=\n\n\u03b1\n2\u03c0\n\nh\ni\n2\n1 + (1 \u2212 y)\n\ndx dQ2\nx Q2\n\n(2)\n.\n\nThat is, the charmed structure function is connected to the charm photoproduction cross\nsection as the following:\n\nF2c (x, Q2)\n\nQ2\n\u03c3(\u03b3p \u2192 c) .\n=\n4\u03c0 2 \u03b1\n4\n\n(3)\n\n\fThe hadronic structure of the photon can also be described by the photon structure function\nF2\u03b3 (x, Q2 ), depending on Bjorken variable x and on the momentum transfer squared Q2 [18].\nThe structure function F2\u03b3 (x, Q2 ) is usually subdivided in two terms \u2013 perturbative (so called\n\"anomalous\") and non-perturbative (\"hadronic\") parts. Such a subdivision of F2\u03b3 (x, Q2 ) is valid\nnot only within the framework of the na\u00efve quark parton model (QPM), but also in the next-toleading order of QCD [18, 19]. The perturbative part is led by direct interaction \u03b3 \u2192 q q\u0304 and\ncan be completely calculated in the framework of the perturbation theory. The contribution of\nthis part in QPM is proportional to ln Q2 and dominates at Q2 \u2192 \u221e. The non-perturbative\npart of F2\u03b3 (x, Q2 ) is completely analogous to the ordinary structure function of hadrons. In\nthe framework of the na\u00efve QPM this part does not depend on Q2 . The QCD evolution of\nF2\u03b3 differs from the evolution of the hadron structure function only due to the existence of the\nperturbative part in the F2\u03b3 thus being described by the inhomogenious DGLAP equations.\nTo calculate the QCD evolution of the non-perturbative part, similarly to the hadron case, it\nis necessary to set the initial conditions at some value of momentum transfer Q0 . As a rule,\nchoosing the initial conditions for the parton distributions in the photon at Q20 \u2248 1 GeV2\nthey suppose, that the hadronic part of F2\u03b3 (x, Q20 ) can be derived from the vector dominance\nmodel (VDM), postulating the transition \u03b3 \u2192 \u03c10 to describe the interaction of the photon with\nhadrons. The parton distribution in \u03c10 meson are obtained using the parton distributions in\npions known from the experiment. For better description of the experimental data the simple\nVDM has been extended by the obvious way by inclusion of iso-scalar vector mesons \u03c9, \u03c6. The\nextention of the VMD by inclusion of heavier mesons from J/\u03c8 family is not, normally, used\nbecause of large masses of J/\u03c8 mesons and the charm content in the photon is described by\nthe evolution of light partons and by the perturbative term \u03b3 \u2192 cc\u0304 [20, 23]. But, as it has\nbeen shown in [20], in the range Q2 \u2264 50 GeV2 charm must not be considered as a light quark\nand the evolution equations must be solved for three light flavours only. This is because of the\nfact that in the threshold region Q2 \u223c 4m2c the charm production must be described by the\nBethe-Heitler process \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 cc\u0304 and by its analogue, the photon-gluon fusion process \u03b3 g \u2192 cc\u0304\nin case of leptoproduction. On the other hand, in paper [24] from comparison of the QCD\nevolution predictions for F2\u03b3 to experimental data the conclusion has been made that even for\nevolution of light quarks the perturbative region in case of the photon starts at Q20 \u2248 5 GeV2 ,\nnot at Q20 \u2248 1 GeV2 . Thus, in present work we use the generalized model of vector dominance\n(GVMD), taking into account also non-perturbative transitions of the photon to J/\u03c8 mesons,\nwhich become possible beyond the J/\u03c8 production threshold.\nThen, it is suitable to represent the wave function of the hadronic component of the photon\nas following:\n\n|\u03b3had > =\n\nX\nV\n\n(c)\n\ns\n\nX\n4\u03c0\u03b1\n(c)\n|\u03b3pert > ,\n|V > + |\u03b3pert > +\nfV2\nq\n\n(4)\n\nwhere terms |\u03b3pert > and |\u03b3pert > take into account the perturbative contributions of the\nprocesses \u03b3 \u2192 q q\u0304 and \u03b3 \u2192 cc\u0304, respectively, and vector mesons V = \u03c1, \u03c9, \u03c6, J/\u03c8 describe\nthe non-perturbative contribution in the hadronic component of the photon. The constants,\ncharacterizing the contributions of vector mesons are [23]:\n\n5\n\n\ff\u03c12/4\u03c0 \u2248 2.20 , f\u03c92 /4\u03c0 \u2248 23.6 ,\nf\u03c62/4\u03c0\n\nf\u03c82 /4\u03c0\n\n\u2248 18.4 ,\n\n(5)\n\n\u2248 11.5 .\n\nAt presence of the hadronic structure of photon, the interactions of its hadronic component\ncan be described in analogue to the ordinary hadrons as interactions of the partons from the\nphoton with the colliding particle. In the framework of the parton model the cross section of any\nprocess is a sum of the cross sections of all elementary subprocesses, weighted by distribution\nfunctions of partons, participating in these subprocesses. If charmed quarks exist in the proton\n(\"intrinsic charm\") the leading over strong interaction constant process at moderate momentum\ntransfers is the scattering of the lepton on charmed quark of the proton lc \u2192 lc. The photongluon fusion process \u03b3 g \u2192 cc\u0304 has the next order in \u03b1s , but its contribution dominates due to\nthe fact that gluons carry almost half of the proton momentum. Thus, one can expect that\nthe contribution in the charm photoproduction comes from four processes - the absorption of\nthe virtual point-like photon by c quark of the proton, the photon-gluon fusion, the scattering\nof the c quark from virtual photon on light partons of the proton and the scattering of light\npartons from the resolved photon on c quarks of the proton. Therefore, the total cross section\nof the charm production can be written as:\n\n\u03c3(\u03b3p) = \u03c3 IC + \u03c3 P GF + \u03c3 \u03c8 + \u03c3 (c) + \u03c3 (q)\n\n(6)\n\nHere, \u03c3 IC defines the absorption of the virtual photon by c quark of the proton; the cross\nsection \u03c3 P GF describes the photon-gluon process \u03b3g \u2192 cc\u0304. The second pair of terms in (6)\ncomes from scattering of c quarks from the photon on the partons of the proton and \u03c3 (q) is led\nby scattering of light partons from the photon on c quark of the proton. The light partons of the\nphoton can originate from the non-perturbative part (light vector mesons \u03c1, \u03c9, \u03c6), as well as\nfrom perturbative part |\u03b3pert >. It follows from (5), that the contribution of J/\u03c8 meson in the\nhadronic component of the photon is about 16% of the contribution of the light vector mesons.\nAt the same time the contribution of scattering of light partons from photon on charmed\nquarks from the proton \u03c3 (q) is proportional to the level of admixture of the charmed quarks in\nthe proton, NIC \u2264 0.01 << 1, and can be neglected. The term \u03c3 (c) describes the contribution\nof the scattering of the \"perturbative\" c quark from the photon on partons of the proton. We\ndenoted as \"perturbative\" those c quarks of the photon, which appear either due to anomalous\npart of the photon hadronic component or to QCD evolution of original light partons. Thus,\nthe distribution of such c quarks can be obtained in the framework of the perturbation theory\n[20, 25] and, as quoted above, this contribution is limited by the range Q2 \u2265 50 GeV2 . Using\nthe parametrization [26] for the distribution of the \"perturbative\" c quarks1 , we have verified,\nthat the contribution of the perturbative term \u03c3 (c) can be safely neglected in the kinematical\nrange considered in present work, Q2 \u2264 80 GeV2 .\nThe contributions in the charm production come also from the processes of parton-parton\nfusion gg \u2192 cc\u0304 and q q\u0304 \u2192 cc\u0304, completely analogous to the processes, describing the charm\nproduction in hadronic collisions. But, these processes have finite total cross sections and their\ncontribution in the charm yield is small in comparison to the photon-gluon fusion process. Thus,\n1\n\nTechnically, we used the respective subroutines from the package PYTHIA 6.1 [27].\n\n6\n\n\fwe also drop them. Quite different situation appears for scattering processes of c quarks from\nJ/\u03c8 meson on light partons of the proton. In the pQCD the cross sections of these processes\nare divergent as 1/p4T . Therefore their contributions can be significant. As the result of the\nabove consideration we keep in (6) only terms \u03c3 IC , \u03c3 P GF and \u03c3 \u03c8 . Their contributions in the\ncharmed structure function will be calculated further. The diagrams of the processes, taken\ninto account in present work are depicted in Fig. 1.\n\n2.2\n\nThe c quark distribution in virtual J/\u03c8 meson\n\nTo find the non-perturbative distributions of c- and c\u0304 quarks in the virtual J/\u03c8 meson we can\nfollow the approach developed in [2]. This approach is based on the statistical model [28] and\non the work [1], allowing to take into account the masses of heavy quarks in the framework of\nthe non-covariant perturbation theory (NPT). This approach allows to find the probability of\ncreation of the Fock state with heavy quarks. The basic point is the fact, that we can use NPT to\nderive the necessary distribution. Feynman diagram is a sum over all time-ordered diagrams of\nthe NPT. The contributions of time-disordered diagrams are proportional to the inverse powers\nof large hadron momentum Ph . Thus, any consideration in the framework of the parton model\nis being carried out in the \"infinite momentum reference frame\", i.e., in the reference frame,\nwhere the hadron momentum is much larger than any of characteristic mass parameters. At\nhigh energies of the colliding particles the momentum of the hadron is sufficiently large, which\nensures the applicability of NPT. Only in this case the virtual configuration of Fock states, in\nwhich the proton fluctuates, can be \"frozen\" for the time of the interaction. If we consider the\nprocesses led by the transition of the photon into a hadron (vector meson), the life-time of the\nvirtual hadronic fluctuation (given Fock state) is \u2206t \u223c 1/\u2206E \u2248 2 Ph / (M 2 \u2212 m2 ) (Ph - the\nhadron momentum, m - hadron mass and M - the mass of the fluctuation) and at high energy\ncan be large enough even for large values of the fluctuation mass M.\nExpression (6) means, in fact, that different terms in (4) do not interfere. This, in turn,\nallows the probabilistic interpretation of the expansion (4). Namely, it is legitimate to assume\nthat during the interaction time the photon is in one of the states, entering the expansion (4).\nIn this case partons of the photon carry all the momentum of the photon (more correctly, all\nthe momentum of the hadronic fluctuation). Due to sharp cut-off over transverse momenta of\npartons, it is sufficient to consider the longitudinal phase space only. We consider a hadron (or\nhadronic fluctuation of the photon in our case) as a statistical system, consisting of m partons,\ncarrying in sum the quantum numbers of the hadron and its momentum. In spirit of the parton\nmodel we suppose an independent creation of each parton with relative momentum \u03be according\nto the probability density \u03c1(\u03be). Then, in the framework of NPT the probability to find n-parton\nfinal state can be written as [2]:\nn\n\ndW\n\n(n)\n\n\u223c\n\n(Ef in\n\n\u0010\n\u0011Y\n1\nd\u03bei\n(3) ~\n~\nPf in \u2212 Ph\n,\n\u03c1i (\u03bei)\n2 \u03b4\n\u03be\n\u2212 Eh )\ni\ni=1\n\n(7)\n\nwhere, n is the total number of partons in the considered fluctuation, P~h and Eh are momentum\nand energy of the hadron; P~f in and Ef in are total momentum and energy of the fluctuation,\nrespectively. \u03b4\u2013function enforces the conservation of the total 3-momentum. Function \u03c1i (\u03bei )\n7\n\n\fdescribes the probability to create ith parton without conservation of the total momentum\nof the system and its quantum numbers. As an argument of the distribution function in the\nvirtual J/\u03c8 meson we use the light-cone variable \u03bei \u2261 \u03bei+ = (\u03b5 + pL )/(Eh + Ph ), where \u03b5, pL\n\u2013 energy and longitudinal momentum of a parton.\nBecause of the life-time of the fluctuation with a pair of charmed quarks being much less\nthan the one for the fluctuation, consisting of light partons only, the full quark-gluon cascade\ncannot develop. This leads to the situation, where the newly created fluctuation with charmed\nquarks does not practically contain light partons and the pair of heavy quarks carries all the\nmomentum of the virtual J/\u03c8. Therefore, the probability to observe the Fock state with cc\u0304\npair can be written as follows [2]:\n\ndW cc\u0304 =\n\nd\u03bec d\u03bec\u0304\n\u03bec2 \u03bec\u03042 \u03c1c (\u03bec ) \u03c1c\u0304 (\u03bec\u0304)\n\u03b4\n(1\n\u2212\n\u03be\n\u2212\n\u03be\n)\n.\nc\nc\u0304\n\u03bec \u03bec\u0304\n(\u03bec + \u03bec\u0304 )2\n\n(8)\n\nIn J/\u03c8 meson charmed quarks are the valence quarks. Thus, coming from Regge phenomenology, one can expect, that at small values of the relative momentum the probability\ndensity \u03c1(\u03be) can be parametrized as:\n\n\u03c1c (\u03be) = \u03c1c\u0304 (\u03be) = \u03be \u03b1 ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere, \u03b1 \u2248 0.5, as in ordinary hadrons. So, the inclusive distribution of the charmed quark in\nthe photon has the form:\n\nc\u03b3 (\u03be) = \u03be \u03b2 (1 \u2212 \u03be)\u03b2 /B(\u03b2 + 1, \u03b2 + 1) ,\n\n(10)\n\nwith \u03b2 = \u03b1 + 1; B(u, v) is beta-function and the charmed quarks distributions are normalized\nR1\non unity, 0 d\u03be c\u03b3 (\u03be) = 1. Choosing \u03b1 = 0.5, one obtains \u03b2 = 1.5. We shall use this value\nin our calculations. The value of \u03b2 = 1.5 is smaller than, e.g., chosen in [21] for description\nof spectra of charmed mesons, measured in experiment ZEUS. But in our case the correct\nform of the distribution of c quarks does not play any significant role since the contribution in\nthe structure function is defined mainly by the value of the total cross section of the parton\nscattering. Then, the momentum transfers in EMC experiment Q2 \u2264 80 GeV2 practically, are\ncompletely in the range, where the perturbative consideration of the production and evolution\nof c quarks is invalid [20]. Thus, we do not consider QCD evolution of c quarks in the virtual\nJ/\u03c8 meson and we shall use scaling expression (10).\n\n2.3\n\nCharmed structure function in leptoproduction\n\nDue to the fact that the structure function is up to a common factor simply sum of cross sections\nof the subprocesses, it can be also represented as a sum of contributions of three processes (see\n(6)):\n\nF2c (x, Q2) = F2IC (x, Q2) + F2P GF (x, Q2) + F2\u03c8 (x, Q2) .\n8\n\n(11)\n\n\fIn framework of parton model the structure function of the \"intrinsic charm\" F2IC is connected to the distribution of charmed quarks in the proton cp (x, Q2 ) and is equal to:\n\nF2IC (x, Q2) = 2 NIC e2c x cp (x, Q2) ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere, x cp (x, Q2 ) is normalized on unity, ec = 32 is the electric charge of c quark and NIC\ndefines the level of the admixture of charmed quarks in the proton.\nThe structure function F2P GF defines the photon-gluon fusion and is [29]:\n\nF2P GF (x, Q2)\n\n=\n\n\u03b1s (\u015d)\n\u03c0\n\n\u001a\n\nwhere,\n\n2\n\nf2(z, Q ) =\n+\n\n\u0002\n\ne2c \u03c0 z\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u221a\n\n1+4\u03bb x\n\nd\u03be\nx\nG(\u03be, Q2) f2( , Q2),\n\u03be\n\u03be\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nVc \u2212 12 + 2z(1 \u2212 z)(2 \u2212 \u03bb)\n2\n\n1 \u2212 2z(1 \u2212 z) + 4\u03bbz(1 \u2212 3z) \u2212 8\u03bb z\n\n\u0003\n2\n\nln\n\n1+Vc\n1\u2212Vc\n\n(13)\n\n\u001b\n\n(14)\n.\n\np\nIn the above expressions \u015d = Q2 (1 \u2212 z)/z, Vc (\u015d) = 1 \u2212 4 m2c /\u015d is the velocity of c quark\nin the (\u03b3g) center of mass system, \u03bb = m2c /Q2 .\nThe contribution of the virtual J/\u03c8 meson, F2\u03c8 , in the charmed structure function is being\nled by the expression (3) and the cross section of the process J/\u03c8 p \u2192 c in framework of parton\nmodel is:\n\n\u03c3\u03c8\n\n4\u03c0\u03b1 X\n= 2 2\nf\u03c8 i\n\nZ\n\nd\u03bei d\u03bec Gp (\u03bei) c\u03b3 (\u03bec ) \u03c3\u0302i(\u015d) .\n\n(15)\n\nFactor \"2\" takes into account the scattering both on c and c\u0304 quarks. Index i runs over all\npartons in the proton, participating in the scattering off the c quark from the photon. Functions\nGp (\u03bei ) and c\u03b3 (\u03bec ) describe the momentum distributions of the ith light parton in the proton\nand c quark in the photon, respectively. The cross section of the scattering of c quark on the\nparton of the proton \u03c3\u0302i (\u015d) depends on the CM energy squared \u015d. It is known that at presence\nof non-perturbative effects, like quark masses, parton model is not a covariant one. Thus when\nperforming the integration in (15) it is necessary to choose some reference frame, satisfying the\nconditions of the applicabilty of parton model. In our case the most suitable reference frame\nis the center of mass system of the virtual photon and the proton. If we use the light-cone\nvariable \u03be + the energy squared \u015d can be expressed through invariant variables x and Q2 and is\nequal to \u015d = m2c + \u03bec \u03bei Q2 /x.\nFormulae for the cross sections of the scattering subprocesses cg \u2192 cg and cq \u2192 cq of\nmassive c quarks in the lowest order over \u03b1s can be found in [8, 30]. For the completeness\nwe give these formulae in the Appendix. Pure kinematically the minimal momentum transfer\nis t\u0302min = 0. Because the cross section of the scattering process is divergent at lower limit\n9\n\n\fof the integration over t\u0302, the first question is, obviously, about the cut-off value t\u0302min . At low\nmomentum transfers pQCD becomes invalid and the value of the cut-off momentum also cannot\nbe calculated theoretically. For the processes with c quarks various choices of |t\u0302min | are being\nused, varying from m2c /4 to m2cT , where m2cT is the transverse mass of c quark squared. We\nshall consider the value of t\u0302min as a free parameter, which must be found from experimental\ndata. We use the same value of |t\u0302min | also in the argument of the strong coupling constant\n\u03b1s (|t\u0302min |), because the main contribution in the total cross section is defined mainly by the\nrange t\u0302 \u223c t\u0302min .\nSince we consider the process \u03b3p \u2192 cc\u0304 + X with large momentum transfer, a coalescence of\none of the final c quarks with the proton remnant is not probable. Thus, according to quantum\nnumbers conservation, there must be as minimum three particles in the final state \u2013 the proton\nand two D mesons. So, general kinematical restriction for the scattering reaction takes the\nform (mD is mass of D meson, mp is the proton mass).\n\n(1 \u2212 x) 2\nQ + m2p \u2265 (2 mD + mp )2 .\nx\n\n(16)\n\nAt presence\n\u221a of the non-zero cut-off t\u0302min there are additional kinematic constrains on threshold energies \u015dth [8, 30] for the subprocess. We also give them in Appendix.\nIt is easy to obtain necessary integration limits in (15), considering the kinematics of the\nparton scattering. Taking into account non-zero value of t\u0302min the integration limits over \u03bei and\n\u03bec are:\n\nh\nx 1+\n\ni\n\u221a\n( \u015dth +mc )2\nQ2\n\nx (\u015dth \u2212m2c )\n\u03bei Q2\n\n3\n\n\u2264 \u03bei\n\n\u2264\n\n1,\n\n\u2264 \u03bec \u2264\n\n1.\n\n(17)\n\nResults and conclusion\n\nWe fitted the calculated F2c (x, Q2 ) to EMC data. The charm photoproduction cross section\n\u03c3(\u03b3p), measured in [3] has been recalculated to the structure function as described in [2].\nComparing the calculations with data we took into account the next-to-leading order QCD\ncorrections to the \"intrinsic charm\" structure function F2IC , as well as non-zero masses of the\nproton and charmed quark (see [2, 17, 31]). When calculating the contribution of the photongluon fusion we used the parametrization MRS(G) for the gluon distribution in the proton from\nPDFLIB package [32]. The parametrization MRS(G) has been obtained with \u03b1s in the second\norder and \u039bQCD = 0.174 GeV. We included mass of the c quark in free parameters to check\nthe self-consistency of our calculations.\nFit of EMC data gave the following values of free parameters:\n\n10\n\n\fNIC = (0.2 \u00b1 0.2)% ,\n\n(18)\n\nmc = (1.51 \u00b1 0.03) GeV ,\n\n(19)\n\n2\n\nt\u0302min = (\u22123.0 \u00b1 0.3) GeV ,\nat good value of \u03c72 /NDF = 0.74. The value of cut-off over the momentum transfer squared\nis approximately equal to the transverse c quark mass squared, as it could be expected from\ngeneral considerations. The resulting value mc = 1.51 \u00b1 0.03 GeV agrees with mc = 1.50 GeV,\nused in the parametrization MRS(G), which testifies the self-consistency of our approach. The\ncomparison of the model with EMC data [3] is given in Fig.2.\nNote the following. In paper [8] the calculations have been performed for the charm excitation mechanism in hadron collisions, i.e., there have been considered the processes of the\nscattering of partons on the charmed quarks of the proton (on \"intrinsic charmed quarks\").\nThe contribution in the charm leptoproduction formed by hadronic component of the photon is\ncompletely analogous to the charm excitation in hadron collisions, considered in [8]. In paper [8]\nthe level of the intrinsic charm in the proton has been chosen equal to 0.5% and the conclusion\nwas made that the charm excitation mechanism ensures the needed yield of charmed particles\nat ISR energies due to steeper rise of the scattering cross section with reaction energy, which\nallows to agree ISR data and data obtained at lower energies in fixed target experiments. In\npaper [8] the cut-off momentum transfer has been chosen equal to t\u0302min = m2c /4 \u2248 0.6 GeV2 ,\nwhich is considerably less than obtained in present paper.\nThe results of present paper give significantly less admixture of the intrinsic charm in the\nproton and much larger value of the cut-off momentum t\u0302min in the scattering subprocesses.\nTherefore, the contribution of the charm excitation mechanism in the hadron collisions is, as\nminimum, order of magnitude less than that obtained in [8] and cannot explain large yield of\ncharmed particles, observed in ISR experiments. Thus, the contradiction between ISR data\nand data of fixed target experiments is not avoided.\nAs it follows from the results of present work, it is not necessary to introduce any visible\nadmixture of the non-perturbative charm quarks in the proton to describe EMC data, even when\nusing \"soft\" gluon distribution. The excess of the EMC data over the photon-gluon predictions\nat large Q2 can be completely explained by the contribution of the hadronic component of the\nphoton. In any case, the considered mechanism decreases significantly the discrepancy between\nEMC data and PGF predictions and, respectively, the admixture of Fock states with charmed\nquarks in the proton.\nOn the other hand, we have introduced a non-perturbative charmed component in the photon wave function. The reason, why the photon can have visible non-perturbative component\nof c quarks in difference to the proton can be understood from result of paper [24], which states\nthat the perturbative regime in the photon starts at Q2 \u2248 5.5 GeV2 , and for the proton the\nDGLAP equations give good description of the evolution of the structure function starting already from Q2 \u2248 (1 \u2212 2) GeV2 . Thus, there is no necessity to introduce the non-perturbative\ncharmed states in the proton and the charm contribution to the proton structure function can\nbe described by pQCD.\n11\n\n\fAcknowledgement\nWe would like to express our gratitude to DESY for hospitality and good working conditions.\n\n12\n\n\fReferences\n[1] S.J.
