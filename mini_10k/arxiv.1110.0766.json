Introduction\nWe discuss the geometric structure of the integrable part of a chaotic three dimensional\ndynamical system. Our approach is generic, however we concentrate on the Lorenz\nmodel [1]. The analysis is performed in the Nambu mechanics [2] formalism. We find\nthat important information regarding the boundary of the strange attractor can be\nextracted from this geometric structure. In addition, the symmetry that underlies the\nphase space geometry leads to mappings between different dynamical systems. Let us\nreview some basic concepts.\nIn [2] Y. Nambu introduced a formalism of classical mechanics to three\ndimensional phase spaces. In his words \"the Liouville theorem is taken as the guiding\nprinciple\". Hence, the formalism applies to systems that preserve the phase space\nvolume, i.e. \u2207~\u03c5 = 0. The motion of points ~x = (x, y, z) \u2208 R3 in phase space is\ndetermined by two functions of (x, y, z), called Nambu Hamiltonians H1 and H2 , by\nthe equations:\n~x \u0307 = \u2207H1 \u00d7 \u2207H2\n(1)\nBy definition (1) the flow is volume preserving, since \u2207~\u03c5 = 0, ~\u03c5 = ~x \u0307 . In general any\nfunction F (x, y, z) is evolving according to\n\u1e1e = \u2207F * (\u2207H1 \u00d7 \u2207H2 ) = \u03b5ijk \u2202i F \u2202j H1 \u2202k H2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b5ijk is the Levi-Civita tensor. The right-hand side defines the Nambu three\nbracket:\n{F, H1 , H2 } = \u03b5ijk \u2202i F \u2202j H1 \u2202k H2\n\n(3)\n\nThe Nambu Hamiltonians are conserved quantities as one can see from (2). The phase\nspace orbit can therefore be realized as the intersection of the surfaces H1 = H1 (t = 0)\nand H2 = H2 (t = 0).\nIn [3, 4] the Nambu bracket is realized as the Poisson bracket, denoted as {*, *}H2 ,\ninduced on the manifold H2 = H2 (t = 0), which is now upgraded to a phase space.\nWe will call this bracket Nambu-Poisson bracket and is defined as in (3). It is\nantisymmetric and satisfies the Jacobi identity. The Nambu-Poisson bracket of one\ndynamical variable xi and H1 is:\n{xi , H1 }H2 = \u03b5qjk \u2202q xi \u2202j H1 \u2202k H2 = \u03b5ijk \u2202j H1 \u2202k H2 \u2261 \u2207H1 \u00d7 \u2207H2\nThe dynamical variables form an algebra on H2\n{xi , xj }H2 = \u03b5qpk \u2202q xi \u2202p xj \u2202k H2 = \u03b5ijk \u2202k H2\n\n(4)\n\nThe evolution of the system is given by\n\u1e8bi = {xi , H1 }H2\n\n(5)\n\nThe surface H2 (x, y, z) = const. = H2 (t = 0) can in some cases be regarded as the\ngroup manifold of a Lie group, for example if H2 = 12 x2 + 12 y 2 + 12 z 2 . In this specific\nexample H2 is just the Casimir of SO(3) , so it is reasonable to call it C and we will\ndo so often in this work, calling H1 as just H as well (in some cases we will stick\nto H1 , H2 notation). Now, C defines an algebra of generalized coordinates x, y, z by\nequation (4):\n{x, y}C = z\n{y, z}C = x\n{z, x}C = y\n\n\fPhase Space Geometry and Chaotic Attractors\n\n3\n\nThe evolution lies on surface C = C(t = 0) = const., with dynamics determined by\nH, or equivalently one can think of the operator {\u2022, H}C as generating the flow by\nrepeated operations of a group element of the group with Casimir C (which group\nelement is determined by H). Therefore, in this case, the surface on which the system\nis constrained is a group manifold.\nThere is a freedom [2] in determining H1 , H2 since any transformation\n(H10 , H20 ) = (H10 (H1 , H2 ), H20 (H1 , H2 )) with Jacobian determinant equal to one leaves\nthe equations of motion invariant:\n\u2207H10 \u00d7 \u2207H20 = \u03b5ijk \u2202j H10 \u2202k H20\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202H10\n\u2202H20\n\u2202H20\n\u2202H10\n\u2202j H1 +\n\u2202j H2\n\u2202k H1 +\n\u2202 k H2\n= \u03b5ijk\n\u2202H1\n\u2202H2\n\u2202H1\n\u2202H2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202H10 \u2202H20\n\u2202H10 \u2202H20\n= \u03b5ijk\n\u2212\n\u2202j H1 \u2202k H2\n\u2202H1 \u2202H2\n\u2202H2 \u2202H1\n\u2202(H10 , H20 )\n|\u2207H1 \u00d7 \u2207H2\n(6)\n=|\n\u2202(H1 , H2 )\nWe will call this freedom a gauge freedom. In the case of linear transformations\nthe gauge group is SL(2, R) and therefore the Nambu Hamiltonians form a doublet\nh = (H1 , H2 ) that transforms under SL(2, R).\nIn this work we will use a decomposition of the Lorenz system (7), which has three\nphase space dimensions, to a conservative (non-dissipative) part and a dissipative part\n[5]. In Hamiltonian mechanics (even phase space dimensions) it is common to add to\nsome known Hamiltonian physical system, forced and dissipative terms. However, it\nis rarely the case that given the equations of motion of a forced, dissipative system\n(\u2207~\u03c5 6= 0), one is asked to guess a decomposition in a Hamiltonian (non-dissipative)\npart and a forced, dissipative part. This decomposition is of course not unique, but\nin Hamiltonian mechanics it is often simple and natural to guess 'the most physical'\ndecomposition. For example, suppose one is given the system\n\u1e8b1 = x2\n\u1e8b2 = \u2212\u03c9x1 \u2212 bx2\nwhich is a dissipative system (\u2207~\u03c5 = \u2212b). It may be decomposed to a non-dissipative\npart ~\u03c5N D with \u2207~\u03c5N D = 0 and a dissipative part ~\u03c5D :\n~\u03c5 = ~\u03c5N D + ~\u03c5D\nOne may choose the parts ~\u03c5N D = (0, \u2212\u03c9x1 ) and ~\u03c5D = (x2 , \u2212bx2 ) or even ~\u03c5N D =\n(x2 + x22 , \u2212\u03c9x1 ) and ~\u03c5D = (\u2212x22 , \u2212bx2 ). Mathematically they are nice equivalent\nchoices but as far as physics is concerned 'the most physical' choice would have been\n~\u03c5N D = (x2 , \u2212\u03c9x1 ) to get the harmonic oscillator for the non-dissipative part and to get\nthe friction force F = \u2212b\u00d7(velocity) for the remaining dissipative part ~\u03c5D = (0, \u2212bx2 ).\nThe situation is analogous in three phase space dimensions using Nambu\nmechanics, even though one is not guided by intuition to find a physical decomposition.\nThe first time a decomposition in Nambu mechanics was applied was in [5] (to the\nLorenz system). In [6] has been set a general framework of the dissipative Nambu\nmechanics with more examples. The decomposition is chosen in [6] so as \u2207~\u03c5N D = 0\nand \u2207 \u00d7 ~\u03c5D = 0. It is not unique, however one is restricted by convenience according\nto motivations. The velocity field can always, at least locally, (see [6] and references\ntherein) be written as\n~ + \u2207D , with ~\u03c5N D = \u2207 \u00d7 A\n~ and ~\u03c5D = \u2207D\n~\u03c5 = \u2207 \u00d7 A\n\n\fPhase Space Geometry and Chaotic Attractors\n\n4\n\n~ and some scalar field D.

This gauge is known as the 'Clebsch-Monge'\nA\ngauge and the scalar functions \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 are usually called 'Monge's potentials' (see also\n[7, 9] for more details on the application of Nambu mechanics on non-Hamiltonian\nchaos and the quantum, non-commutative approach).\nWe are interested, and will focus in this work, in the gauge freedom SL(2, R)\nof H1 and H2 . The application is on the Lorenz system, due to its unique\nsignificance regarding chaotic dynamics and the interesting physical properties of its\nnon-dissipative part in the specific decomposition we will use. We classify the 'Nambu\ndoublets', i.e. the pair of Hamiltonians, of the Lorenz non-dissipative part with\ncriterion the isomorphism of the algebras. We find four different classes of doublets in\nsection 2 that are identified with four different systems in section 4, which are therefore\ndynamically equivalent. Three of them are very familiar physical systems, namely the\nsimple pendulum, the Duffing oscillator and a charged dielectric rigid body inside a\nhomogeneous magnetic field, with the fourth being an SO(2, 1) system. We may say\nthat these four systems are 'dual' to each other.\nWe stress that Lorenz defines his system as a forced, dissipative system [1]. He\nstarts from an abstract, conservative system with some conservative quantity Q which\ncan be a compact 'shell like' surface. Then he makes the hypothesis that '[...],\nwhenever Q equals or exceeds some fixed value Q1 , the dissipation acts to diminish\nQ more rapidly then the forcing can increase Q, then (\u2212dQ/dt) has a positive lower\nbound where Q \u2265 Q1 , and each trajectory must ultimately become trapped in the region\nwhere Q < Q1 .' quoted straight from the famous 1963 paper [1].

In the Lorenz\nsystem, despite of being a dissipative system (\u2207~\n\u03c5 < 0), there is a constant driven\nterm that appears in specific coordinates. For large Xi 's, however, the Lorenz\nsystem behaves as a purely dissipative (not driven) system.\n\n\fPhase Space Geometry and Chaotic Attractors\n\n5\n\nimplies that the conserved quantities of the corresponding conservative system, which\nin our decomposition are the Nambu functions\u2021, is most natural to be used for finding\ntrapping surfaces and for the localization of the attractor in general. This is what we\ndo in section 3 using the Nambu functions of section 2.\nIn section 4.3 we find that the Lorenz system is equivalent to a physical system\nthat presents this type of behaviour, quoted earlier, for the forced, damped terms. This\nsystem is the SO(3) system we mentioned (charged rigid body in a magnetic field),\nbut now with external torques. The generalized coordinates are the three components\n~ The conservative function \"Q\" of Lorenz is just the\nof the angular momentum L.\n~ and its conservation for the conservative part\nmeasure of angular momentum Q = |L|\nexpresses the conservation of angular momentum. The damped terms are torques\nproportional to angular momentum, like air resistance. There is a constant torque\n~ the\nalong Z-direction that acts as a driven(forced) term when Lz < 0. For large L\nfriction terms dominate over the constant torque (see Figure 1). The attractor in this\ncoordinates lies in Lz < 0. Since there exists a constant driven term for Lz , the Lz\nangular momentum could not ever become constantly zero.\nThis system (40) is generalized for arbitrary direction of the magnetic field to give\na new dynamical system. This general system (44) presents new strange attractors\ngiven in Figures 11, 12.\n2.

These are\nall transformations with Jacobian determinant equal to one, as we saw in section 1.\nWe will restrict ourselves in linear transformations so as to work only with quadratic\nfunctions. In this case, the transformation group is the group of real 2 \u00d7 2 matrices\nwith determinant one, namely the SL(2, R). For example let generate a different\ndoublet by action of an SL(2, R) matrix:\n\u0012 0 \u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\nH\n0 1\nH\nC\nh0 = Ah \u21d2\n=\n=\n(16)\nC0\n\u22121 0\nC\n\u2212H\nWe see that the role of H and C can be interchanged, as long as you change the sign\nof one of the functions, since we could have used\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 \u22121\nA=\n1 0\nas wellk.

Once\ninitial conditions are given, the solution of the system should lie on both surfaces\ndefined by\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\nH(X1 , X2 , X3 )\nH(X1 (0), X2 (0), X3 (0))\n=\n(18)\nC(X1 , X2 , X3 )\nC(X1 (0), X2 (0), X3 (0))\nTherefore the intersection of the two Hamiltonians defines the phase space trajectory\n(see Figure 2). Thus, given a Nambu doublet and initial conditions, it is not only\ngiven the equations of motion (velocity field) but the solution of the system, as well!\nk It is apparent that the system is invariant in these cases since \u1e8ai = \u2207H \u00d7 \u2207C = (\u2212\u2207C) \u00d7 \u2207H =\n\u2207C \u00d7 (\u2212\u2207H)\n\n\fPhase Space Geometry and Chaotic Attractors\n\n7\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\n(f)\n\nFigure 2. An orbit, in red, of the conservative system (13) as defined by the\nintersection of various Nambu surfaces (same orbit at each case).\n\nIn equation (17) is defined the Nambu Hamiltonian function C0 that defines a\nhyperboloid, once initial conditions are given. This is a topologically different surface\nfrom the cylinder and parabolic surface of equation (14). An SL(2, R) transformation\nled to a new type of surface. This is reflected to the algebra of the Nambu bracket,\nsince:\n{X1 , X2 }C = \u03c1\n{X2 , X3 }C = \u2212X1\n(19)\n{X3 , X1 }C = 0\nwhile:\n{X1 , X2 }C0 = X3\n{X2 , X3 }C0 = \u2212X1\n{X3 , X1 }C0 = X2\n\n(20)\n\nThe later algebra is the SO(2, 1) algebra\u00b6.

We answer this\nquestion and classify the doublets according to isomorphisms of the algebras.\nLet an arbitrary SL(2, R) matrix\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b1 \u03b2\nA=\n, \u03b1\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b2\u03b3 = 1\n\u03b3 \u03b4\nact on the doublet (17). Then we get a general expression for the possible quadratic\ndoublets+ :\n\u0012\n\u0013\nS(X1 , X2 , X3 ; \u03b1, \u03b2)\nh=\n\u2200\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4 \u2208 R : \u03b1\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b2\u03b3 = 1\n(22)\nS(X1 , X2 , X3 ; \u03b3, \u03b4)\nwith\n1\n1\n1\nS(X1 , X2 , X3 ; \u03b1, \u03b2) = (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2) X12 + \u03b2 X22 + \u03b2 X32 \u2212 \u03b1\u03c1X3\n(23)\n2\n2\n2\nOf course it does not matter with what doublet one may begin, since one can\nalways with a re-parametrization end up with equation (23). The expression for\nS(X1 , X2 , X3 ; \u03b3, \u03b4) is identical with 23 and describes exactly the same surfaces. The\nS(\u03b1, \u03b2) and S(\u03b3, \u03b4) are different only when considered as part of a doublet, because\nit is then imposed the restriction \u03b1\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b2\u03b3 = 1.\nC(\u03bb) = (\u03bb \u2212 1) 21 X12 + 21 X22 + 12 (X3 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c1)2\n\u03bb<1\n\n: a set of hyperboloids centred at X3c = \u03bb\u03c1\n\n\u03bb>1\n\n: a set of ellipsoids centred at X3c = \u03bb\u03c1\n\n\u03bb=1\n\n: a cylinder centred at X3c = \u03c1\n\n\u03bb \u2192 \u00b1\u221e\n\n: a parabolic cylinder\n\nTable 1. The Nambu surfaces\n\nThe possible types of quadratic surfaces are given by equation (23). These\ndetermine the possible Nambu algebras and the geometry of the phase-space through\nthe Nambu bracket:\n{Xi , Xj }S = \u000fijk \u2202k S\nLet \u03bb =\n\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\nwhere C(\u03bb)\n\n\u2208 R and\n1\n1\n1\n(24)\nC(\u03bb) = (\u03bb \u2212 1) X12 + X22 + (X3 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c1)2\n2\n2\n2\nis an abbreviation for C(X1 , X2 , X3 ; \u03bb). Then, up to a constant shift it is:\nS(X1 , X2 , X3 ; \u03b1, \u03b2) = \u03b2C(\u03bb)\n\nRescaling of a Nambu function: H10 = \u03b2H1 leaves the corresponding Nambu surface\ninvariant since: H10 = H10 (0) \u21d4 \u03b2H1 = \u03b2H1 (0) \u21d4 H1 = H1 (0) so that the equations\nH10 = H10 (0) and H1 = H1 (0) define exactly the same surface in the phase space.\nTherefore equation (24) describes all possible quadratic surfaces, which are listed in\n+\n\nNote that there does not exist another different distinct set of quadratic doublets. If it existed\nwould mean that members of one set are not related with members of the other set by transformations\nwith Jacobian determinant one, which is not allowed as can be realized by (6). In addition quadratic\ndoublets can only be related with linear SL(2, R) transformations with each other, because any\nnon-linear transformation would raise the rank of the functions.\n\n\fPhase Space Geometry and Chaotic Attractors\n\n9\n\n(a) Parabolic\n\n(b) Hyperbolic\n\n(c) Cylindrical\n\n(d) Elliptical\n\nFigure 3. The four different classes of the Nambu surfaces (invariant manifolds)\nof the non dissipative part (13) of the Lorenz system. An orbit, in red, of the\nsystem lies on any of these surfaces.\n\nTable 1 and can be seen in Figure 3. From the algebraic point of view the rescaling\nleads to isomorphic algebras. We see that there are infinite surfaces, of four types,\nwhen classified with respect to the isomorphisms of the corresponding algebras. The\nsurface given by S(\u03b1, 0) (that is C of equation (14)) corresponds to \u03bb \u2192 \u00b1\u221e.\nLet list the possible algebras. The hyperboloid centred at the origin C0 gives the\nSO(2, 1) algebra and any other hyperboloid gives an algebra isomorphic to SO(2, 1).\nThe sphere C2 = 12 X12 + 12 X22 + 12 (X3 \u2212 2\u03c1)2 centred at X3c = 2\u03c1, after the\ntransformation X3 \u2192 X3 \u2212 2\u03c1, gives the SO(3) algebra {Xi , Xj }C2 = \u03b5ijk Xk , and\nany ellipsoid, an algebra isomorphic to SO(3).\nThe cylinder C1 = 21 X22 + 12 (X3 \u2212 \u03c1)2 gives the SE(2) algebra after the\ntransformation X3 \u2192 X3 \u2212 \u03c1.\nThe algebra obtained by the parabolic cylinder C(\u221e) call it C = \u2212 21 X12 + \u03c1X3\ncan be realized as the Heisenberg algebra {X1 , X2 }C = \u03c1 of two independent variables\nX1 , X2 on the curved plane C: {X2 , X3 }C = \u2212X1 , {X3 , X1 }C = 0.\nWith these four types we classify the possible Nambu doublets as in Table 2 and\nan orbit defined by six different doublets can be seen in Figure 2.

The Nambu doublets Classification\n\n3. Localization of the Lorenz Attractor\nWhen the dissipative part \u03c5D = (\u2212\u03c3X1 , \u2212X2 , \u2212bX3 ) is added to the system (13), the\nLorenz attractor is formed. This is a global attractor, that is this subset of phase space\nthat every trajectory of any initial conditions approaches for t \u2192 \u221e. By definition the\nattractor should lie in a bounded region and determining this region is what we call\nlocalization. The possible geometries of the boundary of the Lorenz attractor have\nbeen discussed by Lorenz [1, 10], Sparrow [11] and others [12, 13]. We will not find\nnew surfaces, not mentioned in bibliography already. Our scope is only to prove that\nthe Nambu functions found in previous section, i.e. the quadratic invariant manifolds\nof the non-dissipative part, define proper localization surfaces.\nLet us change the notation and use just S for 2C(\u03bb) of equation (24).\nS(X1 , X2 , X3 ) = (\u03bb \u2212 1)X12 + X22 + (X3 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c1)2\n\n(25)\n\nWhen X1 , X2 , X3 are subject to the Lorenz evolution (with the dissipative part\nadded), S is not conserved but is changing with time:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u1e60 = b(\u03bb\u03c1) \u2212 2 \u03c3(\u03bb \u2212 1)X1 + X2 + b(X3 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c1)\n(26)\n2\n2\nAssume for the moment \u03bb > 1. Suppose there exists some real constant Kmax for\nwhich \u1e60 can be positive only inside the ellipsoid S = Kmax and nowhere else (see\nAppendix C of Sparrow [11] and Doering and Gibbon [12], as well). Then for any point\noutside this ellipsoid, \u1e60 < 0 and therefore S will be decreasing until it gets S < Kmax\ni.e. the trajectory gets inside the ellipsoid. Of course, if the trajectory starts inside\nthis ellipsoid, it will remain there, since on the outside is everywhere \u1e60 < 0. If such\nKmax exists, it is the solution of the constrained maximization problem:\nKmax = max{S(X1 , X2 , X3 ) : \u1e60 \u2265 0}\n\n,\u03bb\u22651\n\n(27)\n\nThis is a typical problem to solve with the Lagrange multipliers method (Appendix\nA). This condition defines a compact attracting surface (in fact every other ellipsoid\n\n\fPhase Space Geometry and Chaotic Attractors\n\nFigure 4.\nattractor.\n\n11\n\nThe repelling two-sheeted hyperboloid \u03bb = 0.8 and the Lorenz\n\nS = K with K > Kmax is an attracting surface, since \u1e60 < 0 everywhere on the outside\nof all of these). The solution of (27) is given in (30) where Kmax = Ra2 .\nWe argue here that similar reasoning can be applied for non-positive-definite\nfunctions (non-compact surfaces). For \u03bb < 1 the surfaces are hyperboloids which are\nnon compact. In this case the equation S = K for some constant K defines a one\nsheeted hyperboloid if K > 0 and a two sheeted hyperboloid if K < 0. For simplicity,\nwith no loss of generality, assume that K < 0. Then the condition S > K defines\nthe region outside the 'lobes' of the two sheeted hyperboloid (the attractor lies in this\nregion in Figure 4), while S < K defines the region inside the lobes. As previously,\nassume there exists some constant value Kmin such that \u1e60 can be negative only outside\nthe lobes (region S > Kmin ) and nowhere else. Then any trajectory starting from\ninside the lobes will be expelled to the outside, since \u1e60 > 0 in the inside and therefore\nS is increasing until it gets S > Kmin i.e. the trajectory gets outside the lobes. Of\ncourse, if it starts outside the lobes, it is impossible to get inside. We call such a kind\nof surface, a repelling surface. The same reasoning can be applied to any non-compact\nsurface. The problem is now a minimization problem\u2217\nKmin = min{S(X1 , X2 , X3 ) : \u1e60 \u2264 0}\n\n,\u03bb<1\n\n(28)\n\n\u2212Rr2 .\n\nThe solution is given in (30) where Kmin =\nIn the Appendix A is given\nanalytically the Lagrange's multipliers method.\nAnother way to understand localization is to think of a fixed surface and imagine\nthe flow at each point crossing it (Giacomini and Neukirch [13]). For a localization\nsurface the flow should cross every point of the surface towards the same direction\n(semi-permeable surface) [13]; inwards for the attracting (compact) surfaces and\noutwards for the repelling (non-compact) ones. Or else the trajectory could pass\nthrough the surface in one direction at some point and get through the opposite\ndirection at some other point of the surface. Thus, the scalar product of the vector\nnormal to the surface \u2207S at each point and the vector tangent to the flow ~\u03c5 should\nhave a constant sign at each point. That is:\n~ \u0307\n\u1e60 = (\u2207S) * X\n(29)\n\u2217 The signs is a matter of convention, since we could have used a function S\u0303 = \u2212S and turn the\nproblem to a maximization problem.\n\n\fPhase Space Geometry and Chaotic Attractors\n\n12\n\nFigure 5.

When the dissipative part\nis added, the flow is forced towards the Lorenz attractor.\n\nhas constant sign at every point on a localization surface. This is proven in the\nAppendix B for all repelling surfaces of Equation (31).\nLet summarize our results. We find the following attracting and repelling surfaces:\nS(X1 , X2 , X3 ) = K \u21d4 (\u03bb \u2212 1)X12 + X22 + (X3 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c1)2 = K\n\uf8f1\n2\nfor \u03bb \u2265 1\n\uf8f4 \u2265 Ra\n\uf8f2\n2\n\u2200K \u2208 R : K \u2264 R\u0303r\nfor {\u03bb = 0, \u2212\u221e} and {\u03bb = (\u2212\u221e, 0), X3 > 0}\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n2\n(30)\n\u2264 \u2212Rr\nfor \u03bb < 1\n\uf8f1\n\u03bb\u03c1\nfor\nb\n\u2264\n2\n\uf8f2\n, R\u0303r = \u03bb\u03c1 , Rr = \u03bb\u03c1 \u221a b\nwhere: Ra =\nb\n2 \u03c3(\u03c3\u2212b)\n\uf8f3 \u03bb\u03c1 \u221a\nfor b > 2\n2 b\u22121\nThe attracting cases hold for \u03c3 > 1, the repelling cases hold for \u03c3 > 1 and \u03c3 > b except\nfor the parabolic surface \u03bb \u2192 \u2212\u221e that is \u2212X12 + 2\u03c1X3 = 0 which holds for \u03c3 > b/2.\nThe surfaces that are closer to the attractor and provide the optimum localization are\nthe extreme cases of (30) that correspond to the equalities:\nS = Ra2 , S = R\u0303r2 , S = \u2212Rr2\n\n(31)\n\nThis means that the strange attractor lies in the region A that is defined as:\nA = {(X1 , X2 , X3 ) : S \u2264 Ra2 and S \u2265 R\u0303r2 and S \u2265 \u2212Rr2 }\n\n(32)\n\nThe following surfaces of (30) can be found in Doering and Gibbon [12]: the\nrepelling parabolic cylinder \u2212X12 + 2\u03c1X3 = 0 (\u03bb \u2192 \u2212\u221e), the repelling cone\n\u2212X12 + X22 + X32 = 0 (\u03bb = 0), the attracting cylinder X22 + (X3 \u2212 \u03c1)2 = \u03c12 (\u03bb = 1)\nand the attracting sphere X12 + X22 + (X3 \u2212 2\u03c1)2 = (2\u03c1)2 (\u03bb = 2). The two-sheeted\nhyperboloids (\u03bb < 1) (see Figure 4) were for the first time found by Giacomini and\nNeukirch [13]. In Figure 5 we see that the repelling cone and the repelling parabolic\nsurface define the homoclinic orbits of the non-dissipative system. For b \u2264 2 these\nhomoclinic orbits define also the attracting surfaces (Figure 6).\n\n\fPhase Space Geometry and Chaotic Attractors\n\n13\n\nFigure 6. For b \u2264 2 the strange attractor is localized by the corresponding\nsurfaces of the homoclinic orbit. Here for b = 2 are shown just three of these\nsurfaces. The strange attractor is fairly seen in blue in the interior and the\nhomoclinic orbit is shown in red.\n\n4. Correspondence with physical systems\nThe different Nambu doublets can be interpreted as different physical systems. The\none Nambu Hamiltonian is regarded to be the energy of the system and the other\nhas different interpretations depending on the case (a constraint of the motion or an\nintegral of motion). This framework is providing a way to identify completely different\nphysical systems that have the same dynamics. From the mathematical point of view\nit is just one system in different representations. In our case these are the Heisenberg,\nSE(2), SO(3) and SO(2, 1) formulations that are linked with each other.\n4.1. The unforced, undamped Duffing oscillator\nLet us work with the first doublet (H, C) of Table 2. We reduce the system on the\nparabolic cylinder C = \u2212 12 X12 + \u03c1X3 and the Hamiltonian becomes:\n1 2\n1\n1\nX2 \u2212 2 (\u03c12 \u2212 C)X12 + 2 X14 + const.\n2\n2\u03c1\n8\u03c1\nWe see that \u2200\u03bb the Hamiltonian is the same up to a constant shift.

For C > \u03c12 the potential is a single well while for C < \u03c12 the potential is a\ndouble well and the symmetry of the vacuum state is 'spontaneous broken' (Figure 8).\nThis simple analogue of a mechanism of 'spontaneous symmetry breaking' gives an\nintuitive picture of the formation of the attractor. Equation C = \u03c12 defines a critical\nparabolic surface that separates phase space in the upper region of one vacuum state\nand the lower region of two vacuum states (Figure 9(a)). Suppose the initial conditions\nare above that surface and dissipation is \"turned on\". The system will flow towards\nthe origin until it passes the critical surface when it enters the broken symmetry region\nand has to choose between different vacuum states. It may oscillate around a while but\neventually it is forced outside the critical surface again. The procedure is constantly\n\n\fPhase Space Geometry and Chaotic Attractors\n\n(a) The 3D phase space of the non\ndissipative part (13) and the critical\nparabolic surface.\n\n15\n\n(b) The Lorenz system for initial\n~ = (0, 20, 40) and the\nconditions X\ncritical parabolic surface.\n\nFigure 9. The resemblance with a 'spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism'\ngives an intuitive explanation for the formation of the attractor.\n\nrepeated and the attractor is formed (see Figure 9).\nThis is a qualitative picture. However, when the dissipative part is added,\nthe potential becomes another independent variable of the system. With the\ntransformation X\u03032 = X2 \u2212 \u03c3\u03c1 X1 the full Lorenz system becomes:\n\u1e8a1 = \u03c1X2\n \u0307 = \u2212 1 X 3 + 1 (\u03c12 \u2212 \u03c3 \u2212 C)X \u2212 (\u03c3 + 1)X\u0303\nX\u0303\n2\n1\n2\n2\u03c1 1\n\u03c1\n\u010a = (\u03c3 \u2212 2b )X1 \u2212 bC\nWe see that a locally time dependent potential cannot be defined. The oscillator\ndevelops a friction term and we obtain the Takeyama [14, 15] memory term in the\nRt\npotential: C(t) = C(0)e\u2212bt + (\u03c3 \u2212 2b )e\u2212bt 0 d\u03beeb\u03be X12 (\u03be).\n4.2. Simple pendulum\nNow, let work on the Nambu doublet of Table 2 corresponding to the cylinder\nC1 = 12 X22 + 12 (X3 \u2212 \u03c1)2 . Let apply the transformation X\u03033 = X3 \u2212 \u03c1.

Let study independently the volume preserving part (34).\nThe cylinder becomes: C1 = 12 X22 + 12 X\u030332 and we choose the Hamiltonian for \u03b2 = 0:\n1 2\nX \u2212 \u03c1X\u03033\n(36)\n2 1\nNote the analogy of this Hamiltonian to the one of a simple pendulum Hpend. =\n1 2\n2\n2 p\u03b8 /(ml ) \u2212 mglcos\u03b8.

The phase space portrait of the system (13) reduced on the cylinder\nC1 . Choosing initial conditions for the system (13) is equivalent to choosing both\ninitial conditions and the length for a simple pendulum. The length is determined\nby the radius of the cylinder.\n\np\nwhere our new variables are (\u03b8, p\u03b8 ) since: R = 2C(1) = const. We see that C1 is\njust expressing the constraint that the simple pendulum has constant length. In fact\nX2\nwe have parametrized C1 with (\u03b8, p\u03b8 ): Xi = Xi (\u03b8, p\u03b8 ). We have: \u03b8 = tan\u22121 X\u0303\nand\n3\ntherefore\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202\u03b8\nX\u03033\n\u2202\u03b8\nX2\n= 0,\n=\n,\n=\u2212\n\u2202X1\n\u2202X2\n2C1 \u2202 X\u03033\n2C1\nUsing these derivatives is straightforward to calculate the following Nambu-Poisson\nbrackets:\n\u2202H\n\u2202H\n{\u03b8, p\u03b8 }C1 = 1, {\u03b8, H}C1 =\n, {p\u03b8 , H}C1 = \u2212\n\u2202p\u03b8\n\u2202\u03b8\nHence, the canonical equations are retrieved with:\n1\nH = p2\u03b8 \u2212 \u03c1R cos \u03b8\n2\nThus, Lorenz volume preserving motion (34) reduces to pendulum motion ] on level\nsurfaces of C1 (Figure 10).\nWhen the dissipative part is added the equations of motion (full Lorenz system)\nbecome:\nR\u03b8\u0307 = Rp\u03b8 \u2212 (1 \u2212 b)R sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8 \u2212 b\u03c1 sin \u03b8\np \u0307\u03b8 = \u2212\u03c1R sin \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c3p\u03b8\n\u1e58 = \u2212b\u03c1 cos \u03b8 \u2212 R(sin2 \u03b8 + b cos2 \u03b8)\n\n(37)\n\n4.3.

The phase space portrait of system (45) for\nthe AdS2 case can be seen in Figure 13.\n5. Conclusions\nThe gauge sector of the phase space geometry of a three dimensional volume preserving\ndynamical system is investigated. As a toy model we used the non dissipative part\nof the Lorenz system. Searching for possible valuable informations one may retrieve\nfrom this geometric picture, we found that a rich dynamical structure is revealed.\nThis rich dynamical structure we are referring to, corresponds to different systems\nwhich in our application are the Duffing oscillator (Heisenberg case), the simple\n\n\fPhase Space Geometry and Chaotic Attractors\n\n19\n\nFigure 13. The phase-space of system (13) reduced on the hyperboloid C0 for\nthe case of AdS2 .\n\npendulum (SE(2) case), a uniformly charged rigid body in a uniform magnetic field\n(SO(3) case) and a mathematical SO(2, 1) formulation. All these turn out to be\ndifferent representations of the same dynamics! Similar analysis can be performed\nto any three dimensional volume preserving dynamical system providing insight on a\nunified description of dynamics for specific systems.\nWhen the full dissipative system is considered the invariant manifolds of the\nconservative part can be used for the localization of the strange attractor. In\naddition, in section 4.1, an elementary analogue of a 'spontaneous symmetry breaking\nmechanism' is proposed as an intuitive explanation for the formation of the attractor.\nFor the SO(3) case, in section 4.3, the Lorenz system is physically identified with the\nrigid body system in a homogeneous magnetic field with external friction in every\ndirection and a constant driven term in Z direction. A generalization of this rigid\nbody system for arbitrary magnetic field's direction leads to a dynamical system with\nnew strange attractors (figures 11 and 12).\nLast, we note that the SO(3) formulation could be useful for an angular\nmomentum or spin-based quantization of the Lorenz attractor in accordance with\nthe matrix formulation of [6, 9]. It may also be interesting to investigate the\ncorrespondence with the SO(2, 1) picture in this quantum realm.\nAcknowledgements\nI am grateful to M. Axenides and E.
