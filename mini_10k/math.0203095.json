In each dimension n \u2265 3 there are many projective simplicial toric\nvarieties whose Grothendieck groups of vector bundles are at least as big as the\nground field. In particular, the conjecture that the Grothendieck groups of locally\ntrivial sheaves and coherent sheaves on such varieties are rationally isomorphic\nfails badly.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe question whether the natural homomorphism K0 (X) \u2192 G0 (X) between the\nGrothendieck groups of locally trivial sheaves and coherent sheaves on a complete\nsimplicial toric variety X is a rational isomorphism has attracted an attention of\nresearchers for some time (see [BV]). More generally, it has been conjectured that\nsuch a map is an isomorphism after tensoring with Q for arbitrary quasi-projective\norbifold (see, for instance, [C, Section 7.12]). The main result of this paper says\nthat this is far from being the case even for projective simplicial toric varieties in\ndimensions 3 and higher.\nMore precisely, it was shown in [BV] that K0 (X)Q \u2192 G0 (X)Q is a surjection\nfor a simplicial toric variety X. If X is quasiprojective then by Riemann-Roch for\nsingular varieties [BFM] we have an isomorphism G0 (X)Q \u2192 A\u2217 (X)Q . On the other\nhand the Chow groups of X are finitely generated by [FMSS]. Therefore, G0 (X) has\na finite rank. Fix arbitrary field k, not necessarily algebraically closed and satisfying\nthe conditions char k = 0 and dimQ k = \u221e. Theorem 5 below gives many examples\nof projective simplicial toric k-varieties X such that rank K0 (X) \u2265 dimQ k.\nA word on notation and terminology. Throughout the paper k is assumed to be a\nfield of the mentioned type. An affine monoid means a finitely generated submonoid\nof a free abelian group. It is called positive if there are no non-trivial units, and\nsimplicial if the cone, spanned by the monoid in the ambient Euclidean space, is\nsimplicial (i. e. spanned by linearly independent vectors). An affine monoid M is\nnormal if the implication (c \u2208 N, x \u2208 gp(M), cx \u2208 M) \u21d2 (x \u2208 M) holds, gp(M)\nbeing the group of differences of M. (Here we use additive notation.) Z+ refers to\nthe additive monoid of non-negative integral numbers, Z\u2212 , R+ and R\u2212 are defined\nsimilarly and N = {1, 2, . . .}. A free monoid is the one isomorphic to Zn+ for some\nn \u2208 N. A cone C \u2282 Rn is called unimodular if the submonoid C \u2229 Zn \u2282 Zn is\ngenerated by a part of a basis of Zn . As usual, the rank of an abelian group H\nmeans dimQ (Q \u2297 H).

This paper was made possible by the author's visit to Universit\u00e9 Louis Pasteur (Strasbourg) and the many discussions with Abdallah Al Amrani\nthere. Our initial attempt was to construct such examples among weighted projective spaces \u2013 a question which is motivated by the previous works [Al1, Al2] and\nwhich remains unanswered. Eventually, I have not been able to convince Abdallah\nAl Amrani to coauthor the present paper.\nAlso, I am grateful to the referee for figuring out a somewhat inaccurate use of\nthe Witt(k)-action on nil-K-theory in the first version of the paper.\n2. Basic configuration\nAssume M is a positive normal affine monoid, rank M = r. (We put rank M =\nrank gp(M).) By fixing an isomorphism in gp(M) \u2248 Zr we can make the identification Z \u2295 M = Zn . There is a free basis {x1 , . . . , xr } of gp(M) such that\nR+ M \u2282 R+ x1 + * * * + R+ xr , both cones being considered in Rr . In fact, passing\nto the dual cone (R+ M)op \u2282 (Rr )op we only need the existence of a basis of the\ndual group (Zr )op inside this dual cone and this is easily seen (see, for instance, [G3,\nLemma 2.3(d)]).\nPut e = (1, 0) \u2208 Z \u2295 M and consider the\n\u0001 sequence of submonoids M =\u0001 M0 , M1 ,\nn\nM2 , . . . \u2282 Z defined by Mi = R \u2295 R+ M \u2229 Z(x1 \u2212 ie) + * * * + Z(xr \u2212 ie) , i \u2208 Z+ .\nLemma 1. (a) Z \u2295 M = Ze + M0 = Ze + M1 = Ze + M2 = * * * , all being direct\nsums,\n\u0001\nS\n(b) Z+ e+M0 \u2282 Z+ e+M1 \u2282 * * * and M\u0304 := \u221e\ni=0 Z+ e+Mi = (Z\u2295M)\\{\u2212ie}i\u2208N ,\n(c) there are isomorphisms \u03b1i : Mi \u2192 Mi+1 , i \u2208 Z+ , making the diagrams\n\u2282\n\nZ+ e + Mi \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Z+ e + Mi+1\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e61+\u03b1\n\uf8e6\n1+\u03b1i y\ny i+1\n\nZ+ e + Mi+1 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Z+ e + Mi+2\n\u2282\n\ncommutative.\nThis is easily proved. The isomorphisms \u03b1i , for instance, are the corresponding\nrestrictions of the automorphism Zn \u2192 Zn , e 7\u2192 e, xj 7\u2192 xj \u2212 e (equivalently,\nxj \u2212 ie 7\u2192 xj \u2212 (i + 1)e), j \u2208 [1, r].\nFix arbitrarily two affine normal submonoids N+ \u2282 Z+ e + M and N\u2212 \u2282 Z\u2212 e + M1\nso that the following conditions hold: (i) e \u2282 N+ , \u2212e \u2282 N\u2212 , (ii) N\u2212 \u2229 M1 = {0},\nand (iii) Ze + N+ = Ze + N\u2212 = Ze + M. This is possible: fix two rational cones\nC+ \u2282 R+ e + R+ M and C\u2212 \u2282 R\u2212 e + R+ M1 so that C+ is bounded by the facets\nof R+ e + R+ M, containing e, and one more hyperplane through the origin, and\nsimilarly for the cone C\u2212 with respect to R\u2212 e+R+ M1 under the following additional\nrequirement: the facet of C\u2212 that does not contain \u2212e intersects R+ M1 only at the\norigin. Then N+ = C+ \u2229 Zn and N\u2212 = C\u2212 \u2229 Zn .\nA triple of the type C = (M, N+ , N\u2212 ) will be called a basic configuration.\n\n\fTORIC VARIETIES WITH HUGE GROTHENDIECK GROUP\n\n3\n\n3. Noncomplete case\nLet C be a basic configuration. By X(C) we denote the scheme obtained by gluing\nSpec(k[N+ ]) and Spec(k[N\u2212 ]) along their common open subscheme Spec(k[Z \u2295 M]).\nThis is a toric variety whose fan has two maximal n-dimensional cones \u2013 the dual\ncones (R+ N+ )op , (R+ N\u2212 )op \u2282 (Rn )op . The quasiprojecivity of X(C) is discussed in\nSection 4 below.\nProposition 2. Let C = (M, N+ , N\u2212 ) be a basic configuration in which the monoid\nM is simplicial and non-free. Then rank K0 (X(C)) \u2265 dimQ k.\nWe will use the fact that the K-groups of [TT] agree with those of Quillen for\nquasiprojective schemes over an affine scheme.\nProof. We will use multiplicative notation for the monoid operation with X = e.\nBy [TT, Theorem 8.1] we have the exact sequence K1 (k[N+ ]) \u2295 K1 (k[N\u2212 ]) \u2192\nK1 (k[M][X, X \u22121 ]) \u2192 K0 (X(C)) and, hence, it is enough to show that\n\u0001\nrank Coker K1 (k[N+ ]) \u2295 K1 (k[N\u2212 ]) \u2192 K1 (k[M][X, X \u22121 ]) \u2265 dimQ k.\nOn the other hand, k[M][X, X \u22121 ] = k[M1 ][X, X \u22121 ] by Lemma 1(a) and\nK1 (k[M1 ][X, X \u22121 ]) = K1 (k[M1 ]) \u2295 NK1+ (k[M1 ]) \u2295 NK1\u2212 (k[M1 ]) \u2295 K0 (k[M1 ])\nby the Fundamental Theorem [Ba, Ch.7,\u00a77]. Here K1 (k[M1 ]) \u2295 NK1+ (k[M1 ]) =\nK1 (k[M1 ][X]) and K1 (k[M1 ]) \u2295 NK1\u2212 (k[M1 ]) = K1 (k[M1 ][X \u22121 ]). Because of the\ninclusions k[N+ ] \u2282 k[M][X] and k[N\u2212 ] \u2282 k + X \u22121 k[M1 ][X \u22121 ] the group\n\u0001\nCoker K1 (k[N+ ]) \u2295 K1 (k[N\u2212 ]) \u2192 K1 (k[M][Z])\nsurjects onto\n\u0001\nCoker K1 (k[M][X]) \u2295 NK1\u2212 (k[M1 ]) \u2192 K1 (k[M1 ][X, X \u22121 ]) .\n\u0001\nBut the latter group contains Coker K1 (k[M][X]) \u2192 K1 (k[M1 ][X]) as a direct\nsummand because, firstly, the homomorphism k[M][X] \u2192 k[M1 ][X, X \u22121 ] factors\nthrough k[M1 ][X] \u2192 k[M1 ][X, X \u22121 ] and, secondly, the groups K1 (k[M1 ][X]) and\nNK1\u2212 (k[M1 ]) inside K1 (k[M1 ][X, X \u22121 ]) are complementary direct summand. It is\ntherefore enough to show the inequality\n\u0001\nrank Coker K1 (k[M][X]) \u2192 K1 (k[M1 ][X]) =\n\u0001\nrank Coker K1 (k[M][X])/k \u2217 \u2192 K1 (k[M1 ][X])/k \u2217 \u2265 dimQ k.\n(We view the multiplicative group k \u2217 as a natural direct summand of the K1 -groups.)\nWe can fix a grading k[M1 ][X] = k \u2295 A1 \u2295 A2 \u2295 * * * so that all elements of M1 as well\nas the variable X are homogeneous. This grading restricts to a grading on k[M][X].\nBy Weibel [W], generalizing the Bloch-Stienstra operations on nil-K-theory [Bl][S]\nto the relative situation in arbitrary graded rings, the both groups K1 (k[M][X])/k \u2217\nand K1 (k[M1 ][X])/k \u2217 are modules over the ring of big Witt vectors Witt(k). The\nghost map establishes a ring isomorphism Witt(k) \u2248 \u03a0\u221e\n1 k. Thus there is a copy\nof k inside Witt(k). In particular, due to functoriality of the Witt(k)-action, the\nhomomorphism\nK1 (k[M][X])/k \u2217 \u2192 K1 (k[M1 ][X])/k \u2217\n\n\f4\n\nJOSEPH GUBELADZE\n\nis a homomorphism of k-vector spaces. Thus everything boils down to non-surjectivity of this homomorphism or, equivalently, to non-surjectivity of\nK1 (k[M][X]) \u2192 K1 (k[M1 ][X]).\nAssume the latter map is surjective. We have a filtered union representation k[M\u0304 ] =\nS\nIn particular, K1 (k[M\u0304 ]) = lim\u2192 K1 (k[M][X]) \u2192\ni k[Mi ][X], M\u0304 as in Lemma 1(b).\n\u0001\n* * * \u2192 K1 (k[Mi ][X]) \u2192 * * * . By Lemma 1(c) the mapping K1 (k[Mi ][X]) \u2192\nK1 (k[Mi+1 ][X]) for every index i is the same, up to an isomorphic transformation,\nas the initial homomorphism K1 (k[M][X]) \u2192 K1 (k[M1 ][X]). Therefore, by our surjectivity assumtion all these mappings are surjective. In particular, the limit map\nK1 (k[M][X]) \u2192 K1 (k[M\u0304 ]) is also surjective. But it is injective as well because so is\nthe composite map K1 (k[M][X]) \u2192 K1 (k[M\u0304 ]) \u2192 K1 (k[M][X, X \u22121 ]). The diagram\n\u2282\n\nk[M\u0304 ] \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 k[M][X, X \u22121 ]\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\ny\nk[X] \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\u2282\n\nk[X, X \u22121 ]\n\nis a Cartesian square by Lemma 1(b). Here the vertical maps are defined by m 7\u2192 0 \u2208\nk for all non-trivial elements m \u2208 M. Using the equality K1 (k[M][X]) = K1 (k[M\u0304 ])\nthe associated Milnor Mayer-Vietoris sequence reads as\nK1 (k[M][X]) \u2192 K1 (k[X]) \u2295 K1 (k[M][X, X \u22121 ]) \u2192 K1 (k[X, X \u22121 ])\n(Notice, just surjectivity of K1 (k[M][X]) \u2192 K1 (k[M\u0304 ]) is enough for this sequence.)\nTherefore, the Fundamental Theorem implies NK1\u2212 (k[M]) = 0, i. e. K1 (k[M]) =\nK1 (k[M][X \u22121 ]). Since k[M] is graded ring whose 0th component is k the SwanWeibel homotopy trick (see below) implies K1 (k) = K1 (k[M]), i. e. SK1 (k[M]) = 0\n\u2013 a contradiction by [G2].\n\u0003\nThe mentioned homotopy trick says that for a graded ring \u039b = \u039b0 \u2295 \u039b1 \u2295 * * * and\na functor F from rings to abelian groups the following implication holds F (\u039b) =\nF (\u039b[Z]) \u21d2 F (\u039b0 ) = F (\u039b), Z being an indeterminate (see [An]).\nCorollary 3. Let Z(F ) be a quasiprojective n-dimensional toric variety, defined\nby a fan F in the dual space (Rn )op , and C = (M, N+ , N\u2212 ) be a basic configuration in which the monoid M is simplicial and nonfree. Assume the dual cones\n(R+ N+ )op , (R+ N\u2212 )op \u2282 (Rn )op are among the maximal cones of F and all other\nmaximal cones of F are unimodular. Then rank K0 (Z) \u2265 dimQ k.\nProof. We have the open cover Z = X(C) \u222a A1 \u222a * * * \u222a As , where the Aj are the\nsmooth affine toric varieties (i. e. of type Aak \u00d7 Tbk , a + b = n) that correspond to\nthe mentioned unimodular maximal cones. By [TT, Theorem 8.1] for each j \u2208 [1, s]\nwe get the exact sequence\n\u0001\n\u0001\nK0 X(C) \u222a A1 \u222a * * * \u222a Aj \u2192 K0 X(C) \u222a A1 \u222a * * * \u222a Aj\u22121 \u2295 K0 (Aj ) \u2192 K0 (Uj ),\n\n\fTORIC VARIETIES WITH HUGE GROTHENDIECK GROUP\n\n5\n\n\u0001\nwhere Uj = X(C) \u222a A1 \u222a * * * \u222a Aj\u22121 \u2229 Aj . Since the Uj are open subschemes of\nAj and K0 (Aj ) = Z we have K0 (Uj ) = Z, j \u2208 [1, s]. Therefore, the induction from\nj = 1 to j = s shows that rank K0 (Z) \u2265 dimQ k. (Here one needs dimQ k = \u221e.) \u0003\n4. Projective case\nGiven a basic configuration C in which the monoid M is simplicial. Then X(C)\ncan be embedded into a projective simplicial toric variety as an equivariant open\nsubscheme. A quick way to do so is given by the following construction. Consider the\nintersection \u2206(C) = (e + R+ N\u2212 ) \u2229 R+ N+ . This is a rational n-simplex having a pair\nof corners, spanning respectively the cones R+ N+ and e + R+ N\u2212 . Let X(C) be the\nfollowing projective toric variety. We have the (n + 1)-dimensional cone C(\u2206(C)) =\nS\nn+1\nand the associated monoid ring k[C(\u2206(C)) \u2229 Zn+1 ], which\nx\u2208\u2206(C) R+ (x, 1) \u2282 R\ncarries the graded structure k[C(\u2206(C)) \u2229 Zn+1 ] = k \u2295 C1 \u2295 C2 \u2295 * * * given by the last\ncoordinate\nin the exponent vectors of monomials. Then X(C) = Proj k[C(\u2206(C)) \u2229\n\u0001\nZn+1 ] . Its standard affine charts are Spec(k[Cv \u2229 Zn ]), v \u2208 vert(\u2206(C)), where the\nCv \u2282 Rn are the corner cones spanned by \u2206(C) at its vertices v and then shifted by\n\u2212v. The maximal cones in the fan of X(C) are just the dual cones (\u2212v + Cv )op \u2282\n(Rn )op , v \u2208 vert(\u2206(C)) [F, Section 1.5]. This fan contains (R+ N+ )op and (R+ N\u2212 )op\nas adjacent maximal cones whose common facet is exactly (Re + R+ M)op .\nThe difficulty in applying Corollary 3 to X(C) is that the cones \u2212v + Cv , v \u2208\nvert(\u2206(C)), different from R+ N+ and R+ N\u2212 , are in general not unimodular. We\novercome this difficulty by resolving the corresponding toric singularities without\naffecting Spec(k[N+ ]) and Spec(k[N\u2212 ]). As we will see, sometimes this is possible.\nCall a basic configuration C = (M, N+ , N\u2212 ) admissible if M is simplicial and all\nfacets of (R+ N+ )op and (R+ N\u2212 )op , except maybe their common facet, are unimodular.\nLemma 4. Assume C is an admissible basic configuration. Then there exists an\nequivariant open embedding of X(C) into a projective simplicial toric variety Z whose\naffine charts that do not come from X(C) are all smooth.\nProof. We apply the standard equivariant resolution to X(C) [F, Section 2.6] except we do not touch the cones (R+ N+ )op , (R+ N\u2212 )op . This is possible because\nthe admissibility condition on C guarantees that the cone-subdividing elements\ndo not belong to the\nz \u2208 (Zn )op we produce in\n\u0001 the resolutionn process\n\u0001 boundary\nop\nop\nop\nop\nop\n\u2202 (R+ N+ ) \u222a (R+ N\u2212 ) , that is z \u2208 (R ) \\ (R+ N+ ) \u222a (R+ N\u2212 ) . The projectivity condition is not lost in this process because we essentially have barycentric\n(rather, stellar ) subdivisions \u2013 they are projective \u2013 and a composition of projective\nsubdivisions is again projective [KKMS, Ch.3, \u00a71].\n\u0003\nNow we are ready to prove\nTheorem 5. For each n \u2265 3 there are projective simplicial toric varieties Z for\nwhich rank K0 (Z) \u2265 dimQ k.\nProof. In view of Corollary 3 and Lemma 4 we only need to show the existence of\nadmissible configurations C = (M, N+ , N\u2212 ) in which M is not free.\n\n\f6\n\nJOSEPH GUBELADZE\n\nFirst we observe that there are simplicial rational n-cones whose all facets except\none are unimodular and the distinguished facet is not unimodular (see Example 6\nbelow). Fix such a cone C in the dual space (Rn )op (with respect to the dual lattice\n(Zn )op ). Let F \u2282 C be the nonunimodular facet. The dual cone C op is a rational\nsimplicial cone whose one edge, say l, corresponds to F (under the duality). Put\nN+ = C op \u2229 Zn and denote by e the generator of Zn \u2229 l \u2248 Z+ . By [G1, Theorem\n1.8] Z\u2212 e + N+ = Ze + M \u2032 for some rank r simplicial normal monoid M \u2032 . We have\n(Re + R+ M \u2032 )op = F . As in Lemma 1 we can find a free basis {x1 , . . . , xr } of gp(M \u2032 )\nsuch that R+ M \u2032 \u2282 R+ x1 + * * * + R+ xr . If a natural\u0001 number c is big enough then the\nmonoid M = Zn \u2229 R+ (x1 \u2212 ce) + * * *+ R+ (xr \u2212 ce) satisfies the conditions R+ N+ \u2282\nR+ e + R+ M (equivalently, N+ \u2282 Z+ e + M) and R+ N+ \u2229 R+ M = 0. We fix such\n\u0001 c\nn\nand define the monoid M1 to be Z \u2229 R+ (x1 \u2212(c+1)e)+* * * +R+ (xr \u2212(c+1)e) . To\nconstruct N\u2212 we make the identification of the monoids Z+ e+M and Z\u2212 e+M1 along\nthe isomorphism induced by e 7\u2192 \u2212e, xj \u2212 ce 7\u2192 xj \u2212 (c + 1)e (j \u2208 [1, r]). Then N\u2212\nis by definition the corresponding copy of N+ . It follows from the construction that\n(M, N+ , N\u2212 ) is an admissible basic configuration. (Say, the non-freeness of M follows\nfrom the non-unimodularity of F , i. e. non-smoothness of Spec(k[Ze + M]).)\n\u0003\nExample 6. For each natural\nPnumber r \u2265 2 consider the simplicial normal nonfree\nmonoid Mr = Z+ (1, . . . , 1) + rj=1 Z+ (rej ) \u2282 Zr+ , where ej is the jth standard basic\nvector in Rr (j \u2208 [1, r]). The facets of Rr+ = R+ Mr are unimodular with respect to\nthe sublattice gp(Mr ) \u2282 Zr . Therefore, all facets of the cone R+ (Z+ \u2295 Mr ) = Rn+ ,\nexcept exactly one, are unimodular with respect to the lattice gp(Z+ \u2295 Mr ) =\nZ \u2295 gp(Mr ) \u2282 Rn .\nReferences\n[Al1]\n\nA.
