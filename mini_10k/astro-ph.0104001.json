The instability leads to the formation of gaseous molecular bars with pattern speeds which are\nsubstantially slower than speeds of the primary stellar bars. This spectacular decoupling of nuclear bars from\nthe underlying gravitational potential is triggered but is not driven by the gas viscosity.

Higher viscosity systems form nuclear bars which librate\nabout the primary bar. The shape of a nuclear bar, i.e., its eccentricity, correlates strongly with the angle\nbetween the bars. We also find that such decoupling, partial or full, most probably will be associated with\nbursts of star formation and with gas inflow across the inner (Lindblad) resonance zone towards smaller radii.\nSubject headings: galaxies: evolution \u2013 galaxies: ISM \u2013 galaxies: kinematics & dynamics \u2013 galaxies: starburst \u2013\ngalaxies: structure \u2013 hydrodynamics\n\n1\n\n\f1.\n\nbar, reducing the fraction of chaotic orbits (Pfenniger\n& Norman 1990). The gas presence appears to be\nimperative for this to occur (Shlosman 1999 and refs.\ntherein). In this case, both bars are dynamically decoupled and the angle between them in a face-on disk\nis arbitrary.\nSecond, two bars can co-rotate, being dynamically\ncoupled and their rotation completely synchronized.\nSuch a configuration can be a precursor to the future decoupled phase (discussed above), or continue\nindefinitely (e.g., numerical simulations of Shaw et\nal. 1993; Knapen et al 1995). The nuclear bar is expected to lead the primary bar in the first quadrant\nat a constant angle, close to 90\u25e6 . An explanation\nfor this phenomenon lies in the existense of two main\nfamilies of periodic orbits in barred galaxies, the socalled x1 orbits aligned with the primary bar and the\nx2 orbits which are perpendicular to it (e.g., Binney &\nTremaine 1987). The gas losing angular support due\nto the gravitational torques from the primary bar will\nflow towards the center and encounter the region with\nthe x2 orbits, which it will populate1 . The extent of\nthe x2 family defines the inner resonance region in the\ndisk, i.e., position of the nonlinear inner and outer\nILRs. The nuclear bar may be further strengthened\nby the gas gravity, which drags stars to x2 orbits.\nHowever, the amount of gas accumulating in the ILR\nresonance region may be insufficient to cause the dynamical runaway. In this latter case, it is thought\nthat the synchronized system of two nearly perpendicular bars can be sustained indefinitely, until star\nformation or other processes cease it.\nThird, the secondary bar can rotate in the opposite sense to the primary bar. This situation may\narise from merging, when the outer galactic disk acquires opposite angular momentum to that of the inner disk. It was considered by Sellwood & Merritt\n(1994) and Davies & Hunter (1997) and appeared as\na non-recurrent configuration. At least one of the\nbars should be purely stellar, because the gas cannot\npopulate intersecting orbits.\nAlthough all three options discussed above have\nspecific predictions verifiable observationally, the triggering mechanism(s) for the formation of such systems require much better understanding. To close\nthis gap, we analyze the decoupling process of nuclear bars in disk galaxies. Here we show that dy-\n\nIntroduction\n\nStill unknown, but a substantial fraction of disk\ngalaxies exhibit a phenomenon of double bars, stellar and gaseous (e.g., Shaw et al. 1995; Friedli et al.\n1996; Erwin & Sparke 1999; Kenney 1997; Jogee 1999;\nMarquez et al. 1999; Maciejewski & Sparke 2000;\nMaiolino et al. 2000). The primary bars extend for\nseveral kpc and in most cases define the galactic morphology. The secondary (nuclear) bars, typically less\nthan 1 kpc in extent, are observed only at moderately\nhigh spatial resolution, either in the near-infrared or\nthrough the CO tracer of molecular gas. However,\nin order to study their kinematics, an HST-level of\nresolution is crucial. Both bar types are expected\nto have a profound effect on the gas flow on corresponding spatial scales and, therefore, on the galactic\nevolution. Gas is known to fuel activity, stellar and\nnonstellar, but nowhere else in a galaxy can it influence the overall dynamics to such an extent as in the\ncentral regions. Gasdynamics in primary bars was investigated in great detail, including its effects on the\noverall galactic evolution (e.g., Pfenniger 1996). Gas\nflow in the nuclear bars is largely assumed to be similar and a scaled-down version of the flow in the large\nstellar bars (e.g., Regan & Mulchaey 1999). The validity of this approximation, however, is not based on\ntheoretical analysis.\nDespite the obvious importance of the nested bars\nconfiguration, our understanding of its formation, dynamics and evolution is very limited. Moreover, little work has been performed so far to address the\nspecifics of flow in gaseous as compared to stellar bars.\nEven the sense of rotation of nuclear bars and their\npattern speeds have never been detected directly from\nobservations.\nTheoretically, three options exist. First, if the nuclear bar was formed via self-gravitational instability\n(in the stellar or gaseous disks), it must spin in the direction given by the angular momentum in the disk,\ni.e., in the direction of the primary bar (Shlosman,\nFrank & Begelman 1989). In this case, the pattern\nspeed of the nuclear bar, \u03a9n , will be substantially\nhigher than that of the primary bar, \u03a9p . This was\nconfirmed in numerical simulations which included\nthe gas self-gravity (Friedli & Martinet 1993; Combes\n1994; Heller & Shlosman 1994). The best arrangement corresponds to the corotation radius of the nuclear bar being approximately equal to the radius of\nthe Inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) of the primary\n\n1\n\n2\n\nStrictly speaking, the gas will not occupy the perfectly periodic orbits\nbecause of dissipation, but will be found at nearby energies, which is\nsufficient for our discussion\n\n\fnamical evolution does not stop with the formation of\ntwo coupled perpendicular bars (as described above),\neven when gas self-gravity is neglected. Instead, partial or complete decoupling of a nuclear gaseous bar,\ndepending on the degree of viscosity in the gas, is triggered for a prolonged period of time. This bar either\nlibrates around the major axis of the primary bar, or\nacquires a different pattern speed, which is substantially slower than that of the primary bar. Our work\nis complementary to studies which focused on largescale gas dynamics in barred galaxies, and, due to the\nlimitations of the numerical schemes, did not resolve\nthe central regions discussed here (e.g., Athanassoula\n1992). The role of gas self-gravity in the decoupling\nprocess is fully worked out in a subsequent paper, and\nin this case \u03a9n > \u03a9p . Both regimes are likely to be\nrelevant to our understanding of galactic evolution.\nSection 2 details the formation of the nuclear\ngaseous bar and its subsequent decoupling from the\nprimary bar. Section 3 discusses the physical reasons\nfor this evolution and possible observational implications for disk galaxies.\n2.\n\nShlosman 1994) neglecting the gas self-gravity, and,\nalternatively, using the grid code ZEUS-2D (Stone &\nNorman 1992).\nThe bar potential is turned on gradually to avoid\ntransients. The pattern speed \u03a9p = 1.1 and the bar\nstrength are chosen to form a double ILR in the disk\nand allow the primary bar to end near the UltraHarmonic resonance at r = 0.7, with corotation at\nr = 0.9. Formation of the ILRs is verified using nonlinear orbit analysis (see Heller & Shlosman 1996).\nAlong the primary bar major axis the outer ILR is\nfound at r = 0.14 and inner ILR at 0.05. Note, that\ndue to the primary bar strength, linear analysis gives\nerroneous results about positions of the ILRs. Gas\nsound speed is taken to be 10 km s\u22121 .\n\nNuclear Bar Evolution: Librations About\nthe Primary Bar and Complete Decoupling\n\nIn our study, the disk and its bulge/halo are represented by Miyamoto & Nagai (1975) analytic potentials\nGM\n\u03a6 = \u2212p\n,\nr2 + (A + B)2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere M - mass in units of 1011 M\u2299 and A, B - spatial scaling parameters, in units of 10 kpc, are given\nin Table 1.\nThe large-scale stellar bar is given by the Ferrers'\n(1877) potential with n = 1 and rotates with a prescribed pattern speed \u03a9p . In dimensionless units, its\nmass and semi-major (a) and semi-minor (b) axes\nare 0.18, 0.22 and 0.05, respectively. The dynamical time \u03c4dyn = 1 corresponds to 4.7 \u00d7 107 yrs. The\ngas is evolved using a 2D version of a Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code (details in Heller &\nFig. 1ab.- Representative frame in the evolution of\n(a) the Standard model (upper) (Seq. 1) and (b) highviscosity model (lower) (Seq. 2).

The gas response to the bar torquing is shown in the primary\nbar frame. The primary bar is horizontal and the gas rotation is counter-clockwise. Note a fast evolution after\nt \u223c 150, when the nuclear bar decouples and swings clockwise (!). The bar is 'captured' again at t \u223c 211. Time is\ngiven in units of dynamical time \u03c4dyn . The animation sequences discussed here are available in the online edition\nof the Journal.\n4\n\n\fThe evolution of our Standard model is shown in\nthe animated Sequence 1 in the frame of the primary bar. We ran two additional models with identical initial conditions to that in the Standard model.\nThe only difference is that the value of viscosity was\nchanged by a factor of 2, up and down (hereafter\n'high' [Seq. 2] and 'low' [Seq. 3] viscosity models).\nThis was achieved by varying the coefficients of viscosity \u03b1 and \u03b2 in the prescription given by Hernquist\n& Katz (1989). As expected, the gas responds to the\ngravitational torque from the bar by forming a pair\nof large-scale shocks, loses its angular momentum and\naccumulates in a double ring (corresponding roughly\nto the inner and outer ILRs, see below). In Seqs. 1\n(also Fig. 1a) and 2 (also Fig. 1b), both rings interact\nhydrodynamically and as a result, the outer ring is\ndestroyed and its gas flows into the inner (nuclear)\nring. In the low viscosity model (Seq. 3 and Fig. 1c),\nthe inner ring is destroyed and its gas is mixed with\nthe outer ring at intermediate radii. After merging,\na single oval-shaped ring corotates with the primary\nbar, leading it by \u03c6dec \u223c 50\u25e6 (hereafter, the angle at\ndecoupling) for the high-viscosity Seqs. 1 and 2, and\nby \u223c 85\u25e6 for the low-viscosity Seq. 3. The angle \u03c6dec\nwhile depending on the gas viscosity, is always located\nin the first quadrant.\nNext, the remaining ring becomes increasingly oval\nand barlike (Figs. 2a,b), its pattern speed changes\nabruptly, and it swings towards the primary bar,\nagainst the direction of rotation of this bar. We describe the evolution of this gas flow in terms of the\nbar dynamics and call it a nuclear bar. (In the inertial\nframe, the nuclear bar still spins in the same direction\nas the main bar, albeit with a smaller pattern speed\nthan \u03a9p .) The shape of this bar can be described\nby its axial (minor-to-major) ratio which reaches a\nminimum when both bars are aligned. After crossing the primary bar axis into the 4th quadrant, the\nnuclear bar initially decreases its axial ratio, i.e., becomes less oval. Thereafter it stops, becomes more\noval and speed up in the prograde direction. The bar\naxial ratio is reaching its minimum when both bars\nare aligned and the gaseous bar rotates in the retrograde direction (in the primary bar frame!). Hence, in\nSeqs. 1 and 2, the nuclear bar librates about the primary bar with a decreasing amplitude, being damped\nmore strongly in the higher-viscosity model. The lowviscosity Seq. 3, however, behaves in a qualitatively\ndifferent way. Instead of librating about the primary\nbar, the nuclear bar continues to swing in the same\n\nFig. 2ab.- Standard (a) and high viscosity (b) models: evolution of total specific angular momentum j in\nthe primary bar frame of reference (upper), eccentricity \u01eb = 1 \u2212 b/a (middle) and position angle \u03c6 of the\nline of apses (lower) of the gaseous nuclear bar.

On average, its\npattern speed is about half of \u03a9p , oscillating around\nthis value with a substantial amplitude. At times,\n\u03a9n is very small, giving the impression that the nuclear bar stagnates in the inertial frame of reference.\nWith time, the eccentricity of the nuclear bar gradually decreases and the bar is trapped again by the\nvalley of the potential of the main bar, thus entering\nthe libration phase, similar to Seqs. 1 and 2.\nThis behavior of a nuclear gaseous bar, its formation and librations, and especially the kinematically\ndecoupled phase of evolution was never previously\nobserved in numerical simulations. In the following\nwe provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomena within the framework of orbital dynamics in disk\ngalaxies.\n3.\n\nDiscussion: Non-Self-Gravitating Nuclear\nGaseous Bars as Slow Rotators\n\nIn this paper we neglect the self-gravitating effects\nin the gas. This situation can be encountered in the\nearly type and/or gas deficient barred disks. A large-\n\n5\n\n\fsecting and/or not excessively curved orbits. Otherwise, shocks develop and the gas quickly depopulates\nthese orbits. This difference extends also into nonself-gravitating regime.\nThe most dramatic behavior of gaseous bars in our\nmodels is observed in the least viscous system. Here,\nin the primary bar frame, the nuclear bar decouples\nand swings in the retrograde direction until being captured again by the primary potential valley. In the inertial system, it spins in the prograde direction, but\nits \u03a9n is much smaller than \u03a9p . The precession rate\nof the gaseous bar is the averaged precession rate of\norbits within it, which depends both on the underlying potential and the shape of the orbit. Models with\na higher viscosity show nuclear bar relaxation towards\nthe primary bar in the form of damped librations.\nWhy is the gaseous bar precessing as a solid object\ndespite the absence of self-gravity? A simple exercise, of replacing the SPH gas by collisionless 'stellar' particles, shows that in such a case each particle orbit precesses at a slightly different rate and\nthe bar dissolves into an axisymmetric configuration\nin a few orbital times. Hence, a corresponding stellar bar without self-gravity cannot exist. But in the\nlimit of weak gravity, it will have a confining effect\non stars as well as on gas, and our conclusions will\nstill hold. Addressed elsewhere will be the case of a\ndominant gravity, when self-gravitational modes are\nexcited with pattern speeds well above \u03a9p and overtake the other modes.\nIt is clear, therefore, that it is the 'fluid' (i.e., collisional) nature of the gas which acts to preserve the\nbar despite the presence of internal shear whose effect\nis to widen the flow. This process does not lead to\ncircularization of the orbits because the background\npotential does not admit circular orbits. Dependence\nof bar eccentricity on radius also contributes to the\nshear, which manifests itself in the gradual azimuthal\nshift of lines of apses for individual orbits in the bar.\nAt other azimuths, however, the orbits are re-focused\nagain, preventing the bar from dissolving. Because\nthe gas is not self-gravitating in our approximation,\nthe gravity cannot cause the apse alignment and rigid\nprecession of the ring, using the mechanism of Godreich & Tremaine (1979). Instead, this re-focusing is\npurely hydrodynamical in nature and involves the action of oblique shocks (hydrodynamical torques, i.e.,\nbulk viscosity) in the flow. Of course, such confinement results in the loss of energy by the flow, which\nis radiated away by the isothermal gas in the sim-\n\nFig. 2c.- Low-viscosity model: as in Figs. 1a,b.\nAngle \u03c6 is shown between \u00b1\u03c0/2 for presentation\nonly and discontinuities are marked by vertical dotted lines. Full decoupling of the nuclear bar exists at\n\u03c4 \u2248 150 \u2212 211.\nscale bar in such a galaxy torques the gas, which falls\ntowards the central kpc accumulating in the vicinity\nof the ILR(s) in the form of a nuclear ring. If the\ngas surface density and the overall gas accumulation\nin the ring are small enough, both local and global\nself-gravitational instabilities will be supressed. This\nis the situation we envision. Note, that the positions\nof ILRs are model-dependent and reflect the overall\nmass distribution in a galaxy. If the ILRs are absent\ninitially, this will not affect the instability discussed\nhere, as they will form quickly in response to a growing central mass concentration (e.g., Hasan & Norman\n1990). The evolution in all models was similar in the\nSPH and ZEUS-2D codes, hence only the former is\nshown.\nThe high resolution and our emphasis on the gas\nkinematics in the inner resonance region of disk galaxies allow us to study the evolution of nuclear gas\nwith different viscosities. All models, after some intermediate evolution lead to the formation of a single ring, which quickly acquires a barlike shape with\nwell-defined major and minor axes, and librates or\nprecesses rigidly with a pattern speed independent\nof radius (although the shape is constantly varied).\nWe, therefore, treat this configuration as a bar in all\nrespects. Gaseous bars differ of course from the stellar bars in that the gas can only reside on noninter-\n\n6\n\n\fthis limit is model-dependent of course, but this is of\nno importance to the essence of the decoupling.\n\nulations. This loss of energy by the gas leads to\nnon-conservation of Jacobi energy EJ along the orbit.2 Before the rings merge, this effect is largest on\nthe outer ring because it forms at energies where the\nshear is larger. After merging, the remaining ring\nslowly migrates to lower energies until it encounters\nthe inner ILR, becomes barlike and decouples.\nNext we address the physical reasons for the partial or complete runaways shown in each model. The\nconcept of periodic orbits in barred potentials is central to our understanding of both the stellar and gas\ndynamical evolution in these systems. Most importantly, the families of periodic orbits x1 and x2 , mentioned in section 1, are oriented differently with respect to the large-scale bar. Specifically, the x1 orbits are aligned with the bar between the outer ILR\nand the corotation radius and between the center and\nthe inner ILR. The x2 orbits are perpendicular to the\nbar between the ILRs. The existense of x2 orbits is a\nresult of the \"donkey\" effect (Lynden-Bell 1979). A\ntypical orbit will precess with respect to the bar due\nto the gravitational torques from the latter. These orbits can be 'captured' by the bar potential when the\nprecession rate is sufficiently close to \u03a9p . Trapped orbits will librate either about the valley of the potential\n(x1 orbits), i.e. about the bar major axis, or at right\nangles to the primary bar (x2 orbits). As shown by\nLynden-Bell, some orbits will speed-up when pulled\nback by the bar (the \"donkey\") and some will slow\ndown in response. The former orbits will have a stable orientation along the minor axis of the bar and\ncontribute to the x2 family, while the latter will orient themselves along the major axis and contribute\nto the x1 family. It is worth reminding that the x1\nand x2 orbits are resonant orbits and precess with the\nprimary bar pattern speed \u03a9p . So in the primary bar\nframe they do not change their orientation.\nThe extent of the x2 orbits can only be determined\nself-consistently from a nonlinear orbit analysis. Results are presented in Fig. 3 which displays the characteristic curve of the x2 family for the full range in\nEJ . For the potential at hand, EJ extends from \u22124.6\nto \u22122.7 in our units. It is the lower limit in EJ of the\nx2 orbits which is important, as evident from the EJ\ndistribution of the SPH particles in the nuclear bar\nlocated approximately at the inner ILR at the time\nof decoupling \u03c4 = 150 (Fig. 4). The exact value of\n2\n\nFig. 3.- Characteristic diagram for the potential and\n\u03a9p used here. The y-axis gives the orbit intercepts\nalong the minor axis of the primary bar. Only x1 , x2\nand x3 families are shown. The dotted lines represent\nunstable orbits. The dashed curve labeled ZVC is the\nzero velocity curve. The ILRs are located at EJ =\n\u22124.6 and \u22122.7.\nAs seen in Figs. 1c, 3 and 4, and Seqs. 1-3, the\ninner ring forms just inside the inner ILR (in EJ and\nr), on the x1 orbits and is aligned with the primary\nbar. Its gas was swept up from orbits within the inner ILR by a positive torque from the primary bar.\nThe outer ring forms between the ILRs, on x2 orbits\nof intermediate EJ , and is aligned with the minor\naxis of the bar. Viscosity is most important during\nthe phase when both rings interact hydrodynamically\nand merge, which understandably starts earlier and\nproceeds faster for higher viscosity models. This predecoupling evolution is similar in all models, apart\nfrom the timescale.\nThe crucial difference between the models comes\nfrom (1) position of the nuclear bar on the EJ axis\nafter the merging, and (2) the value of \u03c6dec angle,\ni.e. the orientation of the nuclear bar at the time\nof decoupling. For high-viscosity and standard models the gaseous bar is situated very close to the inner\nILR at EJ = \u22124.6, with a dispersion of \u00b10.1. The\nlow-viscosity bar resides at \u22124.5 and is accompanied\nby an asymmetric 'high'-energy tail which extends to\nabout EJ = \u22123 (Fig. 4) representing a gaseous 'envelope' around the bar (see Fig. 4 and Seq. 3). We\n\nJacobi energy is a conserved total energy of a gas parcel in the rotating\nframe of the primary bar when dissipation is neglected (see e.g., Binney\n& Tremaine 1987 for more details).\n\n7\n\n\flow-EJ gas and the ring is 'lifted' across the inner\nILR, acquiring a leading angle \u03c6dec \u223c 50\u25e6 with respect\nto the primary bar. This is facilitated by a pair of\nleading shocks in the gas. The single remaining ring\nis subject to a gravitational torque from the primary\nbar, which acts to align the ring with the bar. The\ngas, however, responds to the torque in the following\nway. The total angular momentum of the gas can\nbe assumed to consist of a circulation along the ring\nwith a high angular velocity \u03a9 and of a much slower\nprecession \u03a9n due to the torque from the bar which\ntumbles with \u03a9p . While the latter two frequences\nare comparable, they are much lower than \u03a9. As a\nresult, the circulation along the ring can be treated\n(roughly!) as an adiabatic invariant. Therefore, the\ngravitational torque changes the ring's precession rate\nand shape but not the internal circulation.\nIn the pre-decoupling stage, the ring becomes progressively barlike, decreasing its axial ratio. In the\nlow-viscosity model, this gaseous bar resides on purely\nx2 orbits and, therefore, responds to the primary\nbar torque by speeding up its precession while being\npulled backwards until it is almost at a right angle\nto the bar potential valley. Higher viscosity models\nhave gaseous bars forming (after merging) and entering the decoupling phase almost immediately. On the\naverage, the gas in these bars has energies just below\nthat of the inner ILR, where no x2 orbits exist.\nThe decoupling happens abruptly when a substantial fraction, \u223c 1/2, of the gas in the bar finds itself\nat EJ energies below the inner ILR. The absence of\nx2 orbits at these EJ means that the bars either are\nunable to settle on these orbits (Seqs. 1, 2) or lose\ntheir stable orientation along the primary bar minor\naxis (Fig. 1c and Seq. 3). As a result the nuclear bars\nenter librations about the main bar with smaller or\nlarger initial departures from the stable orientation\nalong the main bar, which is a single decisive factor\nseparating the partial and full decouplings.\nThe angle \u03c6dec is largest for Seq. 3 - the reason for\nthe qualitatively different behavior. All three models\nshow that the gaseous bars in the partial or full decoupling phase experience shape changes depending\non their orientation. The bar has a much smaller\neccentricity in the 4th quadrant than in the 1st one\n(Figs. 2a,b,c). Such an asymmetry with respect to\nthe primary bar axis ensures that the resulting gravitational torques from the primary bar are smaller in\nthe 4th quadrant. But only for the least viscous model\n(Fig. 1c), which has the maximal \u03c6dec , does this make\n\nFig. 4.- Evolution of SPH particle distribution with\nthe Jacobi energy EJ for the high-viscosity (left) and\nlow-viscosity (right) models. The sequence depicts\nthe times of formation of two rings, their pre- and\npost-merging configurations, decoupling and postdecoupling of nuclear bar. Note that on the left,\nmerging is accomplished at \u03c4 \u2248 29 after the bar enters libration phase at \u03c4 \u2248 26.5. The x2 orbits exist\nonly between EJ = \u22124.6 and \u22122.7 (Fig. 3).\nnote that the role of viscosity here is fundamentally\ndifferent from that in nearly axisymmetric potentials\n(planetary rings, galactic warps), where it acts to circularize the orbits. In barred potentials, circular orbits do not exist and the gas merely moves from one\nelongated orbit to another.\nThe evolution of the inner ring consists of a few\nphases: formation, merging with the outer ring, migration to the inner ILR, decoupling (partial or full)\nand post-decoupling. The first phase was discussed\nabove, and the later evolution is addressed below.\nThe merging with the outer ring mixes high and\n8\n\n\fthe ultimate difference. In this case the torques are\nunable to confine the bar oscillation, which continues\nfor a full swing of 2\u03c0. The nuclear bar is trapped again\nat \u03c4 \u223c 211, after many rotations with respect to the\nlarge-scale bar. Fig. 5 shows the dramatic effect the\nshape change has on the runaway. For comparison,\nwe display the angular momentum of a hypothetical\n'rigid' bar which is unable to decouple fully.\n\nman et al. (1989) pointed out that the ILR(s) present\na problem for radial gas inflow because the gas can\nstagnate there. A solution was suggested in the form\nof a global self-gravitational instability in the nuclear\nring or disk, which will generate gravitational torques\nin the gas, driving it towards the nuclear region. This\nwas confirmed by numerical simulations (Knapen et\nal. 1995; Shlosman 1996).\nRecently Sellwood & Moore (1999) resurrected the\nidea that ILRs will 'choke' the gas inflow. However,\nas we see here, even non-self-gravitating nuclear rings\nare prone to dynamical instability which drives the\ngas inwards, whether in a full or partial decoupling.\nSecond, this instability can be accompanied by star\nformation along the molecular bar due to increased\ndissipation in the gas, and this star formation will\nhave a quasi-periodic bursting character.\nIn summary, we have investigated the properties of\nnon-self-gravitating gaseous bars in barred disk galaxies and their formation from nuclear rings and decoupling from the underlying gravitational potential.\nWe found that the degree of viscosity in the gas is a\ncrucial factor in the diverging evolution of these systems, namely, the low-viscosity systems are expected\nto spend a substantial period of time in a fully decoupled state, with nuclear gaseous bars having much\nslower pattern speeds compared to the primary bars.\nThe nuclear bar shape is expected to correlate with\nthe angle between the bars. We also find it plausible\nthat gas compression accompanying such decoupling,\npartial or full, can be associated with bursts of star\nformation and with gas inflow across the ILRs towards\nsmaller radii. Both gridless and grid numerical codes\nreproduce the above evolution.\n\nFig. 5.- Low-viscosity model: specific precession angular momentum js of gaseous bar as a function of \u03c6\nduring the fully decoupled phase (starting at \u03c4 = 150\nand \u03c6dec = 85\u25e6 ; first swing only) in the reference\nframe of the primary bar.

The maximum in the gaseous bar\nintensity \u01eb is achieved each time both bars are aligned\nand the minimum occurs when the bars are at right\nangles.\nTwo additional effects should have observational\nconsequences as a corollary to decoupling and the periodic increase in \u01eb. First, the gas will move inwards\nacross the inner ILR on a dynamical timescale.
