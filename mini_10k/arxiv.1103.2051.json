In this paper, a necessary and sufficient\ncondition on the integers p and q is established to determine when a\ntessellation of type {p, q} can be realized as a tessellation of the hyperbolic\nplane by fundamental domains of some Fuchsian group. Specifically, a\ntessellation of type {p, q} is a tessellation by fundamental domains if and\nonly if q has a prime divisor less than or equal to p.\n\nIt is well-known that, for integers p and q with 1/p + 1/q < 1/2, the hyperbolic plane H2 can be tessellated by regular p-gons with q p-gons meeting\nat each vertex. This is called a tessellation of type {p, q}. The group of all\norientation-preserving symmetries of a tessellation of type {p, q} is a Fuchsian\ngroup, and a tessellation of H2 by fundamental domains for this group is obtained by subdividing each of the regular p-gons in the original tessellation into\np triangles sharing a vertex at its centre.\nThe question we deal with here is whether the p-gons themselves are fundamental domains for some Fuchsian group. Equivalently, one can ask for which\np and q does there exist a subgroup of the full group of symmetries of the tessellation of type {p, q} which acts freely and transitively on the set of p-gons in\nthe tessellation? The following result answers this question.\nTheorem 0.1. The tessellation of type {p, q} is a tessellation of the hyperbolic\nplane by fundamental domains of some Fuchsian group if and only if q has a\nprime divisor less than or equal to p.\nThe proof of this theorem can be broken into two Lemmas.\nLemma 0.2. The tessellation of type {p, q} is a tessellation of the hyperbolic\nplane by fundamental domains of some Fuchsian group if and only if there exists\nan involution \u03c3 in Sp (the symmetric group on p letters) such that (\u03c3\u03c1)q = 1,\nwhere \u03c1 is the cyclic permutation (1 2 . . . p) of order p.\n1\n\n\fProof. Let us fix a p-gon F in the tessellation. Let v1 , . . . , vp be the vertices of F ,\nlabeled clockwise from some arbitrary vertex v1 . Let e1 denote the edge between\nvp and v1 , and let ei denote the edge between vi\u22121 and vi for i = 2, . . . , p.\nFirst, let us prove the necessity of the combinatorial condition. Suppose\nthat F is a fundamental domain for some Fuchsian group \u0393. For each of the p\np-gons adjacent to F , there is a unique element of \u0393 which maps it onto F . This\ninduces the well-known edge-pairing for a (polygonal) fundamental domain-\nnamely, for each edge ei of F there is a unique non-identity element \u03b3i \u2208 \u0393 and\na unique edge of F , which we will denote by e\u03c3(i) , such that \u03b3i maps e\u03c3(i) onto\nei . Note that we do not exclude the possibility that ei = e\u03c3(i) , in which case \u03b3i\nis a rotation about the midpoint of ei by \u03c0.\nSince \u03b3i\u22121 maps ei onto e\u03c3(i) , we see that \u03b3i\u22121 = \u03b3\u03c3(i) and e\u03c3(\u03c3(i)) = ei . Thus\nthe edge-pairing of F provides an involution \u03c3 \u2208 Sp . We now prove the relation\nbetween \u03c3 and \u03c1 by considering the q images of F about any vertex vi .\nConsider any edge ei of F . The adjacent edge of F which shares the vertex\nvi is e\u03c1(i) , where \u03c1 is the cyclic permutation defined in the statement of the\ntheorem. By the definition of \u03c3, \u03b3\u03c3\u03c1(i) F is the p-gon adjacent to F in the tessellation which shares the edge e\u03c1(i) , and \u03b3\u03c3\u03c1(i) v\u03c3\u03c1(i) = vi . The edge of \u03b3\u03c3\u03c1(i) F\nwhich is adjacent to \u03b3\u03c3\u03c1(i) e\u03c3\u03c1(i) and shares the vertex vi is \u03b3\u03c3\u03c1(i) e\u03c1\u03c3\u03c1(i) . Noting\n\u22121\nthat \u03b3\u03c3\u03c1(i) \u03b3\u03c3\u03c1\u03c3\u03c1(i) \u03b3\u03c3\u03c1(i)\nmaps the edge \u03b3\u03c3\u03c1(i) e\u03c3\u03c1\u03c3\u03c1(i) of \u03b3\u03c3\u03c1(i) F to \u03b3\u03c3\u03c1(i) e\u03c1\u03c3\u03c1(i) ,\nwe see that \u03b3\u03c3\u03c1(i) \u03b3\u03c3\u03c1\u03c3\u03c1(i) F is the p-gon adjacent to \u03b3\u03c3\u03c1(i) F sharing the edge\n\u03b3\u03c3\u03c1(i) \u03b3\u03c3\u03c1\u03c3\u03c1(i) e\u03c3\u03c1\u03c3\u03c1(i) = \u03b3\u03c3\u03c1(i) e\u03c1\u03c3\u03c1(i) . Continuing in this manner anti-clockwise\nabout the vertex vi , we obtain\n\u03b3\u03c3\u03c1(i) \u03b3\u03c3\u03c1\u03c3\u03c1(i) . . . \u03b3(\u03c3\u03c1)q (i) F = F\nand\n\u03b3\u03c3\u03c1(i) \u03b3\u03c3\u03c1\u03c3\u03c1(i) . . . \u03b3(\u03c3\u03c1)q (i) e(\u03c3\u03c1)q (i) = ei .\nSince F was assumed to be a fundamental domain for \u0393, the first equality shows\nthat\n\u03b3\u03c3\u03c1(i) \u03b3\u03c3\u03c1\u03c3\u03c1(i) . . . \u03b3(\u03c3\u03c1)q (i) = 1,\nand thus the latter gives\n(\u03c3\u03c1)q (i) = i.\nThis holds for any i = 1, . . . , p, and hence (\u03c3\u03c1)q = 1.\nConversely, suppose we have an involution \u03c3 \u2208 Sp with (\u03c3\u03c1)q = 1. We generate the group \u0393 by using the edge-pairing isometries described by \u03c3. Specifically, let \u03b3i be the unique orientation-preserving isometry of the hyperbolic\nplane which maps the edge ei onto e\u03c3(i) (and does not map F onto itself). Now\nlet \u0393 be the subgroup of the full group of symmetries of the tessellation of type\n{p, q} which is generated by \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3p . Note that we immediately have the\nrelation \u03b3i\u22121 = \u03b3\u03c3(i) . We need to show that \u0393 acts freely and transitively on the\nset of p-gons in the tessellation.\nFor any \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393, the p-gon adjacent to \u03b3F and sharing the edge \u03b3ei is \u03b3\u03b3\u03c3(i) F .\nFurthermore, the generator \u03b3\u03c3(i) which appears in this context is clearly unique\nas such amongst the generators \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3p . This observation yields a one-toone correspondence between words in these generators (not using inverses) and\npaths in the dual graph1 of the tessellation beginning at F . The correspondence\n1 The dual graph of the tessellation is the graph whose vertex set is the set of p-gons in the\ntessellation, with two p-gons being joined by an edge if and only if the p-gons are adjacent.\n\n2\n\n\fassociates the word \u03b3i1 . . . \u03b3in to the path passing successively through the pgons\nF , \u03b3i1 F , . . . , \u03b3i1 . . .\u03b3in F .\nFurthermore, two such paths are homotopic in the dual graph (relative to their\nendpoints) if and only if their corresponding words can be made equal using\nonly the relations \u03b3i \u03b3\u03c3(i) = 1.\nThe connectedness of the dual graph now immediately implies the transitivity of \u0393 acting on the set of p-gons of the tessellation. It remains to demonstrate\nthe freeness of this action. In the context of the dual graph, it needs to be shown\nthat every path beginning and ending at F corresponds to a word which multiplies in \u0393 to give the identity element.\nUsing the arguments from the first part of the proof, one can observe that\nthe hypothesis (\u03c3\u03c1)q = 1 is precisely the condition that the word corresponding\nto the path around any given vertex vi of F multiplies in \u0393 to give the identity.\nLet us call these \"primitive paths\". To complete the proof one only needs to\nobserve that any path in the dual graph which begins and ends at F can be\nwritten as a concatenation of conjugates of these primitive paths.\nTheorem 0.1 is now reduced to a combinatorial problem.\nLemma 0.3. There exists an involution \u03c3 \u2208 Sp such that (\u03c3\u03c1)q = 1 if and only\nif q has a divisor d 6= 1 which is less than or equal to p.\nProof. If (\u03c3\u03c1)q = 1 then q is a multiple of the order of \u03c3\u03c1, which is greater than\none and divides p!. This proves necessity.\nFor sufficiency, suppose m \u2264 p is a divisor of q. We will explicitly construct\nan involution \u03c3 \u2208 Sp such that \u03c3\u03c1 has order m. Put\np = am + r\nfor integers a and r with 0 \u2264 r < m. Note that a \u2265 1 since m \u2264 p. Now define\n\u03c3 as the following product of disjoint transpositions:\n\u03c3=\n\na\u22121\nY\u0010\nj=1\n\n\u0011 r\u22121\n\u0011\nY\u0010\nj(m\u22121)+1 p\u2212(j \u22121)\np\u2212a\u22122k p\u2212a\u2212(2k \u2212 1)\nk=0\n\nThis formula should be interpreted using the convention that if a = 1 then\nthe first product is empty, and if r = 0 then the second product is empty.\nCalculation reveals that the product \u03c3\u03c1 decomposes as the following product of\ndisjoint m-cycles:\n\u03c3\u03c1\n\n=\n\na\u22121\nY\u0010\n\n\u0011\n(j \u2212 1)(m\u22121)+1 (j \u2212 1)(m\u22121)+2 . . . j(m\u22121) p\u2212(j \u22121) *\n\nj=1\n\n\u0010\n(a\u22121)(m\u22121)+1 (a\u22121)(m\u22121)+2 . . .\n. . . p\u2212a\u22122r p\u2212a\u2212(2r\u22121) p\u2212a\u2212(2r\u22123) . . .\n\u0011\n. . . p\u2212a\u22121 p\u2212a+1 .\n\n3\n\n\fThe arguments above are not particular to hyperbolic geometry. The results\nhold equally in the Euclidean case (1/p + 1/q = 1/2) and the spherical case\n(1/p + 1/q > 1/2), where the Fuchsian group is replaced by a discrete group of\norientation-preserving isometries of R2 or S 2 , respectively. However, this does\nnot add anything significant to the result since there are only finitely many such\nregular tessellations. In fact, one finds that all such regular tessellations of the\nplane and sphere are realisable as tessellations by fundamental domains of some\ndiscrete group of orientation preserving isometries with one exception - the\nicosahedron (type {3, 5}).\n\nReferences\n[1] S.
