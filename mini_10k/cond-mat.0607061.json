This is demonstrated for the erosion of clay\npebbles in a controlled laboratory apparatus. Photographs at various stages of erosion are analyzed,\nand compared with two models. We find that the curvature distribution complements the usual\nmeasurement of aspect ratio, and connects naturally to erosion processes that are typically faster\nat protruding regions of high curvature.\nPACS numbers: 45.70.-n,83.80.Nb,91.60.-x,02.60.Jh\n\nIn soft matter physics it is well understood why certain objects have naturally rounded shapes. For example, liquid droplets are round due to surface tension [1]\nand bilayer vesicles are round due to bending rigidity [2].\nIn both cases the equilibrium shapes are determined by\nfree-energy minimization, and sinusoidal perturbations\ndecay exponentially with time according to a power of\nthe wavevector. But how do pebbles in a river or on\na beach come to have their familiar, smooth, rounded\nshapes [3]? Are there similarly simple physical principles\nthat govern the evolution of freshly-fractured polyhedral\nrocks into smooth rounded pebbles? Aristotle proposed\nthat erosion is more rapid at regions farther from the\ncenter, where greater impulses can be more readily delivered [3]. However this idea has not been quantified or\ntested, and we are aware of no other models for the origin\nof pebble shapes.\nA wealth of knowledge already exists on naturallyoccurring pebbles [4], thanks to decades of field and laboratory study [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. There is a rich terminology\nfor describing sizes (grain, pebble, cobble, boulder) and\nshapes (angular, rounded, elongated, platy). The simplest quantitative shape description is to form dimensionless indices from the lengths of long vs intermediate\nvs short axes. There is still debate as to how these axes\nare best defined, as well as to which dimensionless ratios\nare most useful [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Another quantitative\nmethod used more for grains than for flat pebbles involves\nFourier transform of the contour [4, 16, 17, 18]. There\nthe relative amplitudes of different harmonics give an indication of shape in terms of roughness at different length\nscales. However a Fourier description is not particularly\nnatural because peaks erode faster than valleys, so that\nsinusoidal perturbations cannot erode without changing\nshape. To make progress in understanding the origin of\npebble shapes, one needs a quantitative shape description in terms of microscopic variables directly relevant to\nthe erosion process.\nIn this paper we propose to quantify the shape of flat\npebbles in terms of curvature, measured at each point\n\nalong the entire two-dimensional contour. The curvature\nK equals the reciprocal radius of a circle that locally\nmatches the contour, and can be deduced from the coordinates of the pebble boundary [19]. This could be useful,\nsince one can imagine faster erosion at protruding regions\nof higher positive curvature, and perhaps no erosion for\nscalloped regions of negative curvature. To illustrate the\nuse of curvature for shape description, we perform a laboratory experiment in which clay pebbles are eroded from\ncontrolled initial shapes. We find that the curvature distribution along the pebble contour becomes stationary,\nindicating a final fixed-point shape. Surprisingly, this\nstationary shape is not a perfect circle. We then introduce two models of pebble erosion, and test them using\nthe curvature distribution as well as the aspect ratio. We\nfind that the curvature distribution is a more incisive tool\nfor discriminating between models. These results point\nthe way for future studies, both of naturally-occurring\npebbles and of lab-eroded pebbles of more direct geophysical interest.\nFor our laboratory experiments, the pebbles were prepared from ordinary white clay (\"chamotte\"), molded\ninto different polygonal shapes with uniform 0.5 cm\nthickness. Individual pebbles were eroded one at a time\nin a square pan, 30 \u00d7 30 cm2 with 7 cm walls, spun at\n1 Hz around the central axis perpendicular to the bottom surface and oriented at 45\u25e6 away from vertical. The\npebble is first dragged upwards, at rest on the pan; near\nthe top it begins to slide, and it accelerates until striking\nthe wall; then it rolls along the side, comes to rest, and\nstarts a new cycle. Erosion is mainly caused by collision\nwith the walls. At five minute intervals, corresponding to\nroughly 300 collision events, the clay pebble is removed\nand photographed. As an example, photographs of one\ninitially-square pebble with sides of 5 cm are shown in\nFig. 1; digitized contours are shown in the inset of Fig. 2a.\nEvidently the erosion is fastest at the corners, which protrude and have high positive curvature. Once the corners\nhave been removed, the pebble reaches a nearly round\nshape that progressively shrinks.\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: Shape evolution of a 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 0.5 cm3 square pebble eroded in a rotating basin, depicted on the lower right,\nwith roughly 300 cutting events between each photograph.\nThe time sequence is left to right, and top to bottom.

Note that the red curves are indistinguishable, indicating a stationary final shape. The final shape is\nnot circular, as demonstrated both by the black-dotted circle\nin the inset and by the gradual rise of f (K) from zero to one.\n(b) Left axis: Cumulative curvature distribution for the final shapes attained by clay pebbles of varied initial shape, as\nlabeled; the number of runs for each shape is given in parentheses. Right axis: average curvature distribution for all final\nshapes, \u03c1 = df/dK, and best fit to a Gaussian.\n\nThe first step in analysis is to deduce the value of the\ncurvature at each digitized point along the contour by\nlinear-least-squares fits of radius vs angle to a third-order\npolynomial. Some care is needed in choice of fitting window: if it is too small then the matrix inversion of the\nfit is singular [20], if it is too large then the fit deviates\nsystematically from the contour points; results for all acceptable windows are averaged together. As a check, the\nperimeter P is computed from straight-line segments between adjacent points and is confirmed to equal 2\u03c0 divided by the average curvature hKi [19].\nAs a shape-descriptor, we next construct the curvature distribution such that \u03c1(K)dK is the probability of\nfinding a value of the curvature between K and K + dK.\nFor reliability, it is preferable to work with the cumulaRK\ntive curvature distribution, f (K) = 0 \u03c1(K \u2032 )dK\u2032 , which\nmay be computed as the fraction of the perimeter with\ncurvature less than K [20]. For a perfect circle, \u03c1(K) is\na delta-function and f (K) is a step-function. The evolution of f (K) for one square pebble is shown in the main\nplot of Fig. 2a, corresponding to the contours of the inset.\nNote that the results are plotted vs K/hKi in order to\nremove a trivial scale factor related to the ever-shrinking\nperimeter. Evidently, the curvature distribution starts\nbroad but narrows down as erosion proceeds. By about\nthe fifth (purple) or sixth (largest red) contour, the form\nof f (K) vs K/hKi reaches a steady state that fluctuates\naround a well-defined average. If the initial shape is circular, then by contrast the form of f (K) starts narrow\nbut broadens as erosion proceeds.\nTo test the possible influence of initial conditions on\nthe final shape, we repeat the erosion experiment of\nFig. 2a for clay pebbles molded into several different\nshapes. In all cases the form of f (K) vs K/hKi eventually becomes time independent, with results given for\ndifferent initial shapes on the left axis of Fig. 2b. To\nwithin fluctuations comparable with those seen for a single stationary pebble as it shrinks further, these are all\nidentical. Thus the final shape is truly stationary, independent of both size and the initial conditions, and\nmay be quantified by averaging together the final cumulative curvature distributions for all pebbles; the results\nare shown by open circles in Fig. 2b. Note that its form\nis not set by uncertainty in curvature measurement, since\nthe circular pebble started with a narrower distribution.\nThe stationary curvature distribution, obtained by numerical differentiation of the average f (K), is shown on\nthe right axis of Fig. 2b. Clearly it is not a delta-function,\nand hence the shape is not a perfect circle. The form of\n\u03c1(K) can be reasonably fit to a Gaussian, as shown, with\na standard deviation of \u03c3/hKi = 0.7. However, the actual distribution is skewed in the tails and has a standard\ndeviation of \u03c3/hKi = 0.8. Though our laboratory erosion\nexperiment may be artificial from a geophysical perspective, it is interesting that a stationary shape exists and\nthat it is not trivially circular.

We begin with a \"polishing model\" in which erosion is directly\ncoupled to curvature. Namely, the normal velocity at\neach boundary point is taken in proportion to curvature,\nfor regions of positive curvature, and is zero otherwise.\n(If all points are moved normally in proportion to curvature, irrespective of sign, then it has been proven that\nany initial contour will shrink to a point and approach a\ncircle in this limit [21].) The evolution predicted by the\npolishing model for a square pebble is shown in Fig. 3.\nIn the top plot, Fig. 3a, the contours and cumulative curvature distributions are plotted at the same sequence of\nperimeters, and with the same line-color codes, as the\nactual data in Fig. 2a. As expected, this model is highly\nefficient at polishing a rough pebble into a smooth shape.\nIt becomes essentially circular, to the eye, soon after the\nentire original boundary has been eroded. The cumulative curvature distribution, f (K), appears to approach\na step function, contrary to our laboratory experiments\nshown in Fig. 2. Thus the polishing model may be appropriate for other natural or laboratory erosion processes,\nbut not for ours.\nTo track evolution toward a final shape more clearly,\nand to compare new vs old shape description methods,\nthe aspect ratio of the pebbles and the width of the curvature distributions are shown in Figs. 3b-c. These are\nplotted vs perimeter divided by the initial perimeter, as\na surrogate for the duration of erosion (except that time\nevolution is from right to left). Since major and minor orthogonal axes are equal for a square shape, we work with\nthe \"caliper\" aspect ratio, C/A, of largest to smallest separations for parallel planes that confine the pebble; as the\nname suggests, this quantity may be readily measured in\nthe field using calipers. For a dimensionless measure of\nthe width of the curvature distribution, we take the standard deviation, \u03c3, divided by the average curvature, hKi.\nThe results for all pebbles are plotted in Figs. 3b-c, with\nfour initially-square pebbles highlighted by larger symbols. Stationarity is reached when the square pebbles are\neroded to about 3/4 of their initial perimeter, after which\nboth C/A and \u03c3/hKi data fluctuate significantly about\nan average value. These fluctuations represent real shape\nchanges, not measurement uncertainty, and are larger for\nC/A than for \u03c3/hKi. Predictions by the polishing model\nfor the evolution of the four square pebbles are also included for completeness. While the initial agreement is\nsatisfactory, the polishing predictions for C/A and \u03c3/hKi\nquickly fall below the data and, furthermore, do not exhibit fluctuations.\nTo more successfully explain the laboratory erosion,\nwe introduce a minimal one-parameter \"cutting model\".\nWe imagine the effect of collision between pebble and\nwall is to create a straight fracture near the boundary\n\n(c)\n\n2\n1\n0\n0\n\nP/P\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0\n\nFIG. 3: [Color online] (a) Contours (inset) and cumulative\ncurvature distribution predicted by the \"polishing model\" for\na square pebble.

Predictions of\nthe polishing model, applied to the four square pebbles, are\nshown by solid curves.\n\nwhose size, on average, is set by the collision impulse;\ne.g. note the unusually large cut in the third photograph\nin Fig. 1. At each erosion step of the model, we thus pick\na contour point at random and we choose a cut length\nfrom an exponential distribution whose average is some\nfraction \u03b1 of the square-root of the pebble area. One can\nimagine other choices, but an exponential is simple and\nthe impulse is set by the area rather than the perimeter.\nTo match the cutting model with our data, we take\n\u03b1 = 0.042 in order that the final, stationary shape have\nthe same curvature distribution width as the laboratory\npebble data. The resulting evolution of the contours\nand curvature distributions predicted for one square pebble are shown in Fig. 4a. As observed in the lab, the\ncorners erode faster than the flat sections and the final\nshape is nearly, but not perfectly, circular. The cutting\nmodel predictions are compared directly with the C/A\n\n\f4\n1\n\n(a)\n\nf(K)\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n0\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1.4\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n(b)\n\n1.3\n\nC/A\n\nK/<K>\n\nWe acknowledge insightful discussions P.

Displayed\nquantities are the same as for the \"polishing model\" in Fig. 3.\n\nand \u03c3/hKi data in Figs. 4b-c. While the final average\nvalue of \u03c3/hKi is correct by design, our model also captures several other features of the data: the final average\nvalue of C/A, the magnitude of shape fluctuations in the\nstationary shape, and the rate of evolution from initial\nto final shapes. In spite of this success, the full form\nof f (K) in Fig. 4a is not completely correct in fine detail. Particularly, the model does not generate regions of\nnegative curvature. No doubt this could be remedied by\ntaking cuts from an appropriate distribution of shapes,\nnot just straight. Such refinements could be tested by\ncomparison with f (K) data.\nIn conclusion, the distribution of curvature along the\ncontour of a pebble is more incisive than the aspect ratio\nas a tool for both describing pebble shapes and for testing\nmodels. The characterization of such eroded forms is of\nobvious importance in the subfield of geology known as\nsedimentology [4], where pebbles are considered as witness to the geological conditions under which they were\nformed. It would therefore be of great practical consequence if there existed a method to decipher the message imprinted in a pebble shape, a method that would\n\n[1] A.
