We consider subordination chains of simply connected domains\nwith smooth boundaries in the complex plane. Such chains admit Hamiltonian\nand Lagrangian interpretations through the L\u00f6wner-Kufarev evolution equations. The action functional is constructed and its time variation is obtained.\nIt represents the infinitesimal version of the action of the Virasoro-Bott group\nover the space of analytic univalent functions.\n\n1. Introduction\nMany physical processes may be interpreted as expanding dynamical systems\nof domains in the complex plane C or in the Riemann sphere \u0108. This leads to the\nstudy of time-parameter L\u00f6wner subordination chains. In particular, we are interested in L\u00f6wner chains of simply connected univalent domains with smooth (C \u221e )\nboundaries. There exists a canonical identification of the space of such domains\n(under certain conformal normalization) with the infinite dimensional K\u00e4hler manifold whose central extension is the Virasoro-Bott group. A L\u00f6wner subordination\nchain \u03a9(t) is described by time-dependent family of conformal maps z = f (\u03b6, t)\nfrom the unit disk U onto \u03a9(t), normalized by f (\u03b6, t) = a1 (t)\u03b6 + a2 (t)\u03b6 2 + . . . ,\na1 (t) > 0. After 1923 seminal L\u00f6wner's paper [15] a fundamental contribution to\nthe theory of L\u00f6wner chains has been made by Pommerenke [18, 19] who described\ngoverning evoluton equations in partial and ordinary derivatives, known now as the\nL\u00f6wner-Kufarev equations due to Kufarev's work [13]. A particular case of subordination dynamics is presented by the Laplace growth evolution (or Hele-Shaw\nadvancing evolution) consisting of the Dirichlet problem for a harmonic potential\nwhere the boundary of the phase domain is unknown a priori (free boundary), and,\nin fact, is defined by the normality of its motion. (see, e.g., [8, 21, 25]). The aim\nof our paper is to give a Hamiltonian and Lagrangian descriptions of the subordination evolution. In particular, we discuss the relations between the L\u00f6wner-Kufarev\nequations in partial and ordinary derivatives, construct the action functional, obtain its time variation. This variation represents the infinitesimal version of the\naction of the Virasoro-Bott group over the space of analytic univalent functions.\n\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Hamiltonian formulation of the subordination evolution\nThe parametric method emerged more than 80 years ago in the celebrated\npaper by L\u00f6wner [15] who studied a time-parameter semigroup of conformal oneslit maps of the unit disk U coming then at an evolution equation called after him.\nHis main achievement was an infinitesimal description of a semi-flow of such maps\nby the Schwarz kernel that led him to the L\u00f6wner equation. This crucial result was\ngeneralized, then, in several ways (see [19] and the references therein).\nA time-parameter family \u03a9(t) of simply connected hyperbolic univalent domains forms a subordination chain in the complex plane C, for 0 \u2264 t < \u03c4 (where\n\u03c4 may be \u221e), if \u03a9(t) \u2282 \u03a9(s), \u03a9(t) 6= \u03a9(s), whenever t < s. We suppose that\nthe origin is an interior point of the kernel of {\u03a9(t)}\u03c4t=0 , and the boundaries \u2202\u03a9(t)\nare smooth (C \u221e ). Let us normalize the growth of the evolution of this subordination chain by the conformal radius of \u03a9(t) with respect to the origin to be et . By\nthe Riemann Mapping Theorem we construct a subordination chain of mappings\nf (\u03b6, t), \u03b6 \u2208 U , where each function f (\u03b6, t) = et \u03b6 + a2 (t)\u03b6 2 + . . . is a holomorphic\nunivalent map of U onto \u03a9(t) for every fixed t.\nPommerenke's result [18, 19] says that given a subordination chain of domains\n\u03a9(t) defined for t \u2208 [0, \u03c4 ), there exists an analytic regular function\np(\u03b6, t) = 1 + p1 (t)\u03b6 + p2 (t)\u03b6 2 + . . . ,\n\n\u03b6 \u2208 U,\n\nsuch that Re p(\u03b6, t) > 0 and\n(1)\n\n\u2202f (\u03b6, t)\n\u2202f (\u03b6, t)\n=\u03b6\np(\u03b6, t),\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03b6\n\nfor \u03b6 \u2208 U and for almost all t \u2208 [0, \u03c4 ). The equation (1) is called the L\u00f6wnerKufarev equation due to two seminal papers by L\u00f6wner [15] with\n(2)\n\np(\u03b6, t) =\n\neiu(t) + \u03b6\n,\neiu(t) \u2212 \u03b6\n\nwhere u(t) is a continuous function regarding to t \u2208 [0, \u03c4 ), and by Kufarev [13] in\ngeneral case, where this equation appeared for the first time.\nIn [26], the case of smooth boundaries \u2202\u03a9(t), being embedded into the class of\nquasidisks, has been proved to admit a specific integral form of the function p(\u03b6, t)\nas\nZ\n\u03bd(\u03c9, t)\n\u03b6\nd\u03c9,\np(\u03b6, t) = 1 +\n2\u03c0i\n\u03c9(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03b6)\nS 1 =\u2202U\n\nfor almost all t \u2208 [0, \u03c4 ], where the function \u03bd(\u03c9, t) belongs to the Lie algebra Vect S 1\nof the vector fields on the unit circle S 1 , with the the Poisson - Lie bracket given\nby\n[\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 ] = \u03bd1 \u03bd2\u2032 \u2212 \u03bd2 \u03bd1\u2032 ,\nwhere the derivatives are taken with respect to the angle variable of S 1 .

Interpreting the function H(\u03b6, f \u2032 , t) as a Hamiltonian we\nmust write\n\u2202\u03b6\n\u2202H(\u03b6, f \u2032 , t)\n(4)\n= \u2212\u03b6p(\u03b6, t),\n=\u2212\n\u2202t\n\u2202f \u2032\nformally yet. Equations (3) and (4) constitute the conjugate pair of Hamilton's\nrelations, however this requires some additional clearance to give sense to the equation (4). This equation is just the L\u00f6wner-Kufarev equation in ordinary derivatives\n\u03b6\u0307 = \u2212\u03b6p(\u03b6, t).\nThe equation (1) represents a growing evolution of simply connected domains.\nLet us consider the reverse process. Given an initial domain \u03a9(0) \u2261 \u03a90 (and\ntherefore, the initial mapping f (\u03b6, 0) \u2261 f0 (\u03b6)), and a function p(\u03b6, t) with positive\nreal part normalized by p(\u03b6, t) = 1 + p1 \u03b6 + . . . , we solve the equation (1) and ask\nwhether the solution f (\u03b6, t) represents a subordination chain of simply connected\ndomains. The initial condition f (\u03b6, 0) = f0 (\u03b6) is not given on the characteristics\nof the partial differential equation (1), hence the solution exists and is unique.\nAssuming s as a parameter along the characteristics we have\nd\u03b6\ndf\ndt\n= 1,\n= \u2212\u03b6p(\u03b6, t),\n= 0,\nds\nds\nds\nwith the initial conditions t(0) = 0, \u03b6(0) = z, f (\u03b6, 0) = f0 (\u03b6), where z is in U .\nObviously, t = s. We still need to give sense to this formalism because the domain\nof \u03b6 is the entire unit disk, however the solutions to the second equation of the\ncharacteristic system range within the unit disk but do not fill it. Therefore, introducing another letter w in order to distinct the function w(z, t) from the variable\n\u03b6, we arrive at the Cauchy problem for the L\u00f6wner-Kufarev equation in ordinary\nderivatives for a function \u03b6 = w(z, t)\ndw\n= \u2212wp(w, t),\ndt\nwith the initial condition w(z, 0) = z. The equation (5) is the non-trivial characteristic equation for (1). Unfortunately, this approach requires the extension of\nf0 (w\u22121 (\u03b6, t)) into U (w\u22121 means the inverse function) because the solution to (1)\nis the function f (\u03b6, t) given as f0 (w\u22121 (\u03b6, t)), where \u03b6 = w(z, s) is a solution of the\ninitial value problem for the characteristic equation (5) (or (4)) that maps U into\nU . Therefore, the solution of the initial value problem for the equation (1) may be\nnon-univalent.\nLet A stand for the usual class of all univalent holomorphic functions f (z) =\nz + a2 z 2 + . . . in the unit disk. Solutions to the equation (5) are regular univalent\n\n(5)\n\n\f4\n\nALEXANDER VASIL'EV\n\nfunctions w(z, t) = e\u2212t z + a2 (t)z 2 + . . . in the unit disk that map U into itself.\nConversely, every function from the class A can be represented by the limit\nf (z) = lim et w(z, t),\n\n(6)\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nwhere there exists a function p(z, t) with positive real part for almost all t \u2265 0, such\nthat w(z, t) is a solution to the eqiation (4) (see [19, pages 159\u2013163]). Each function\np(z, t) generates a unique function from the class A. The reciprocal statement is\nnot true. In general, a function f \u2208 A can be determined by different functions p.\nFrom [19, page 163] it follows that we can guarantee the univalence of the\nsolutions to the L\u00f6wner-Kufarev equation in partial derivatives (1) assuming the\ninitial condition f0 (\u03b6) given by the limit (6) with the function p(*, t) chosen to be the\nsame in the equations (1) and (5). Originally, these arguments have been made by\nProkhorov and the author in [20]. We remark also that an analogous Hamiltonian\nH one may also find in [4].\nThe Hamiltonian H is linear with respect to the variable f \u2032 , therefore, the\nHamiltonian dynamics which is generated by H is trivial and the velocity is constant. In [20] we studied another Hamiltonian system for a finite number of the\ncoefficients of the function w(z, t) generated by the equation (5). It turns out that\nthe Hamiltonian system generated by the coefficients is Liouville partially integrable\nand the first integrals were obtained and were proved to possess a contact structure.\nHowever, the Hamiltonian was again linear with respect to the conjugate system,\nand we have both systems accelerationless. In order to describe a non-trivial motion\nwe proceed with the Lagrangian formulation.\n3. Lagrangian formulation of the subordination evolution\nLet us consider a subordination chain {\u03a9(t)}\u03c4t=0 , 0 \u2208 \u03a9(t), and the timeparameter family of the real-valued Green functions G(z, t) of \u03a9(t) with the logarithmic singularity at 0. If z = f (\u03b6, t) is the Riemann map from the unit disk U\nonto \u03a9(t), f \u2032 (0, t) = et , then G(z, t) = \u2212 log |f \u22121 (z, t)|. The unit normal vector n\nto \u2202\u03a9(t) in the outward direction can be written as\nn=\n\n\u03b6f \u2032 (\u03b6, t)\n,\n|f \u2032 (\u03b6, t)|\n\n|\u03b6| = 1.\n\nTherefore, the normal velocity vn of the boundary \u2202\u03a9(t) at the point f (ei\u03b8 , t) may\nbe expressed as\nf \u0307\nei\u03b8 f \u2032\n\u2032\n= |f \u2032 |\u03c1(ei\u03b8 , t),\n=\n|f\n|Re\nvn = Re f \u0307\n|f \u2032 |\nei\u03b8 f \u2032\nwhere the function \u03c1(ei\u03b8 , t) was defined in the preceding section. Thus, \u03c1(ei\u03b8 , t) =\nvn |\u2207G|.\nThe easiest Lagrangian is given by the Dirichlet integral\nZZ\n|\u2207G|2 d\u03c3z ,\nD\n\ndz\u2227 dz\u0304\n2\n\nwhere d\u03c3z =\n, locally for any measurable set D \u2282 \u03a9(t) \\ {0}. However,\nthis functional cannot be defined globally in \u03a9(t) \\ {0} because of the parabolic\nsingularity at the origin. To overcome this obstacle we define the energy represented\n\n\fENERGY CHARACTERISTICS OF SUBORDINATION CHAINS\n\n5\n\nby this Lagrangian in the following way. Let \u03a9\u03b5 (t) = \u03a9(t) \\ {z : |z| \u2264 \u03b5} for a\nsufficiently small \u03b5, U\u03b5 = {\u03b6 : \u03b5 < |\u03b6| < 1}. Then the finite limit\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f2Z Z\n|\u2207G|2 d\u03c3z + 2\u03c0 log \u03b5\n(7)\nE = lim\n\u03b5\u21920 \uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n\uf8f3\n\u03a9\u03b5 (t)\n\nexists. Applying the conformal map z = f (\u03b6, t) and changing variables we arrive\nat the representation of the energy\nE = E[f ] = 2\u03c0 log |f \u2032 (0, t)| = 2\u03c0t,\njust by the capacity (or the conformal radius in this case) of \u2202\u03a9(t). In other\nwords, E represents the classical action for the Lagrangian defined by the Dirichlet\nintegral. This interpretation allows us to get less trivial Lagrangian description of\nsubordination dynamics, that in particular, emerges in the Liouville part of the\nCFT [17, 22].\nThe classical field theory studies the extremum of the action functional, and its\ncritical value is called the classical action. The critical point \u03c6\u2217 satisfies Hamilton's\nprinciple (or the principle of the least action), i.e., \u03b4S[\u03c6\u2217 ] = 0, which is the EulerLagrange equation for the variational problem defined by the action functional S[\u03c6].\nFor the action given by the Dirichlet integral the classical action is achieved for the\nharmonic \u03c6\u2217 and the principle of the least action leads to the Laplacian equation\n\u2206\u03c6 = 0 as above. The Liouville action plays a key role in two-dimensional gravity\nand leads to the Liouville equation, a solution of which is the Poincar\u00e9 metric of\nthe constant negative curvature. This conformal metric is of a paticular interest,\nbecause no flat metric satisfies the Einstein Field Equation. The conformal symmetry of CFT is generated by its energy-momentum tensor T whose mode expansion\nis expressed in terms of the operators satisfying the commutation relations of the\nVirasoro algebra. The (2,0)-component of the energy-momentum tensor in the Liouville theory is given by the expression T\u03c6 = \u03c6zz \u2212 12 \u03c62z that leads to the classical\nSchwarz result T\u03c6 = Sf (\u03b6) with the Schwarzian derivative Sf where f is the ratio\nof two linearly independent solutions to the Fuchsian equation w\u2032\u2032 + 21 T\u03c6 w = 0.\nIn the case of subordination chains our starting point will be a Riemannian\nmetric ds2 = e\u03c6(z) |dz|2 . In the case of the Liouville theory, the real-valued potential\n\u03c6 satisfies the Liouville equation \u03c6zz\u0304 = 12 e\u03c6 (generally, with certain prescribed\nasymptotics which guarantee the uniqueness). Geometrically, this means that the\nconformal metric ds2 has constant negative curvature -1 on the underlying Riemann\nsurface corresponding to prescribed singularities. Let us consider the complex Green\nfunction W (z, t) whose real part is G(z, t) = log |f \u22121 (z, t)|, z \u2208 \u03a9(t) \\ 0, as before.\nWe have the representation W (z, t) = \u2212 log z+w0 (z, t), where w0 (z, t) is an analytic\nregular function in \u03a9(t). Because of the conformal invariance of the Green function\nwe have the superposition\n(W \u25e6 f )(\u03b6, t) = \u2212 log \u03b6,\n\u22121 \u2032\n\nand the conformally invariant complex velocity field is just W \u2032 (z, t) = \u2212 ff \u22121 (z, t),\nwhere \u03b6 = f \u22121 (z, t) is the inverse to our parametric function f and prime means\nthe complex derivative. Rewriting this relation we get\n(8)\n\n(W \u2032 (z, t) dz)2 =\n\nd\u03b6 2\n.\n\u03b62\n\n\f6\n\nALEXANDER VASIL'EV\n\nThe velocity field is the conjugation of (\u2212W \u2032 ). In other words the velocity field\nis directed along the trajectories of the quadratic differential in the left-hand side\nof (8) for each fixed moment t. The equality (8) implies that the boundary \u2202\u03a9(t)\nis the orthogonal trajectory of the differential (W \u2032 (z, t) dz)2 with a double pole\nat the origin. The dependence on t yields that the trajectory structure of this\ndifferential changes in time, and in general, the stream lines are not inherited in\ntime. These lines are geodesic in the conformal metric |W \u2032 (z, t)||dz| generated by\nthis differential. Let us use the conformal logarithmic metric generated by (8)\n\u2032\n\nds2 =\n\n|f \u22121 |2\n|dz|2 = |W \u2032 |2 |dz|2 ,\n|f \u22121 |2\n\nwhich is intrinsically flat. Unlike the Poincar\u00e9 metric, the hyperbolic boundary is\nnot singular for the logarithmic metric whereas the origin is. But it is a parabolic\nsingularity which can be easily regularized. The density of this metric satisfies the\n\u22121 \u2032 2\nusual Laplacian equation \u03c6zz\u0304 = 0 in \u03a9(t) \\ {0}, where \u03c6(z) = log |f|f \u22121 ||2 . The\nfunction \u03c6 possesses the asymptotics\n\u03c6 \u223c log\n\n1\n,\n|z|2\n\n|\u03c6z | \u223c\n\n1\n|z|2\n\nas z \u2192 0,\n\ntherefore, the finite limit\n(9)\n\nS = S[\u03c6] = lim\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 Z\n\n\u03b5\u21920 \uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u03a9\u03b5 (t)\n\n|\u03c6z |2 d\u03c3z + 2\u03c0 log \u03b5\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n\nexists and is called the logarithmic action.\n\nLemma 1. The Euler-Lagrange equation for the variational problem for the\nlogarithmic action S[\u03c6] is the Laplacian equation \u2206\u03c6 = \u22124\u03c0\u03b40 (z), z \u2208 \u03a9(t), where\n\u03b40 (z) is the Dirac distribution supported at the origin, where \u03c6 is taken from the\nclass of twice differentiable functions in \u03a9(t)\\{0} with the asymptotics \u03c6 \u223c \u2212 log |z|2\nas z \u2192 0.\nProof. Let us consider first the integral\nZ\nZ\n|\u03c6z |2 d\u03c3z = \u03c7\u03a9\u03b5 (t) |\u03c6z |2 d\u03c3z ,\nS\u03b5 [\u03c6] =\n\u03a9\u03b5 (t)\n\nC\n\nwhere \u03c7\u03a9\u03b5 (t) is the characteristic function of \u03a9\u03b5 (t). Then, due to Green's theorem,\nZ\nS\u03b5 [\u03c6 + hu] \u2212 S\u03b5 [\u03c6]\n= 2 \u03c7\u03a9\u03b5 (t) Re \u03c6z uz d\u03c3z\nlim\nh\u21920\nh\nC\nZ\nZ\n1\n1\n\u2202\u03c6\n= \u2212\nu\u2206\u03c6 d\u03c3z +\nu\n(10)\nds,\n2\n2\n\u2202n\n\u03a9\u03b5 (t)\n\n\u2202\u03a9\u03b5 (t)\n\nin distributional sense for every C \u221e (C) test function u supported in \u03a9(t). On the\nother hand, we have \u2202\u03c6/\u2202n \u223c \u22122/\u03b5 as \u03b5 \u2192 0 and u = 0 on \u2202\u03a9(t).

Obviously, the logarithmic term in the\ndefinition of S[\u03c6] does not contribute into the variation.\n\u0003\nStraightforward calculation gives\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n\u22121 f \u2032\u2032\n\u25e6 f \u22121 (z, t.)\n+\n\u03c6z = \u2032\nf\nf\u2032\n\u03b6\n\nHence, the action S can be expressed in terms of the parametric function f as\n\uf8f1\n\uf8fc\n2\n\uf8f2Z f \u2032\u2032\n\uf8fd\n1\n(11)\nS = S[f ] = lim\n+\nd\u03c3\n+\n2\u03c0\nlog\n\u03b5\n+ 2\u03c0 log |f \u2032 (0, t)|,\n\u03b6\n\u03b5\u21920 \uf8f3\n\uf8fe\nf\u2032\n\u03b6\nU\u03b5\n\nor adding the logarithmic term into the integral we obtain\n!\nZ\n2\nf \u2032\u2032\n1\n1\n(12)\nS[f ] =\n+\n\u2212 2 d\u03c3\u03b6 + 2\u03c0 log |f \u2032 (0, t)|.\nf\u2032\n\u03b6\n|\u03b6|\nU\n\nWithin the quantum theory of Riemann surfaces the Liouville action is a K\u00e4hler\npotential of the Weil-Petersson metric on the space of deformations (Teichm\u00fcller\nspace), see [28, 29]. We use a flat metric instead, nevertheless, as we show further\non, there are several common features between smooth subordination evolution and\nthe Liouville theory. In particular, we shall derive the variation of the logarithmic\naction S and give connections with the Virasoro algebra and the K\u00e4hler geometry\non the infinite dimensional manifold Diff S 1 /S 1 .\n4. Variation of the logarithmic action and the K\u00e4hler geometry on\nDiff S 1 /S 1\nWe denote the Lie group of C \u221e sense preserving diffeomorphisms of the unit\ncircle S 1 = \u2202U by Diff S 1 . Each element of Diff S 1 is represented as z = ei\u03c6(\u03b8)\nwith a monotone increasing, C \u221e real-valued function \u03c6(\u03b8), such that \u03c6(\u03b8 + 2\u03c0) =\n\u03c6(\u03b8) + 2\u03c0. The Lie algebra for Diff S 1 is identified with the Lie algebra Vect S 1 of\nsmooth (C \u221e ) tangent vector fields to S 1 with the Poisson - Lie bracket given by\n[\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 ] = \u03bd1 \u03bd2\u2032 \u2212 \u03bd2 \u03bd1\u2032 .\nThere is no general theory of infinite dimensional Lie groups, example of which is\nunder consideration. The interest to this particular case comes first of all from the\nstring theory where the Virasoro (vertex) algebra appears as the central extension\nof Vect S 1 and gives the mode expansion for the energy-momentum tensor. The\ncentral extension of Diff S 1 is called the Virasoro-Bott group. Entire necessary\nbackground for the construction of the theory of unitary representations of Diff S 1 is\nfound in the study of Kirillov's homogeneous K\u00e4hlerian manifold M = Diff S 1 /S 1 .\nThe group Diff S 1 acts as a group of translations on the manifold M with the group\nS 1 as a stabilizer. The K\u00e4hlerian geometry of M has been described by Kirillov\nand Yuriev in [11]. The manifold M admits several representations, in particular,\nin the space of smooth probability measures, symplectic realization in the space of\nquadratic differentials. Let A stand for the class of all analytic regular univalent\nfunctions f in U normalized by f (0) = 0, f \u2032 (0) = 1. We shall use its analytic\nrepresentation of M based on the class \u00c3 of functions from A which being extended\nonto the closure U of U are supposed to be smooth on S 1 . The class \u00c3 is dense in A\nin the local uniform topology of U . There exists a canonical identification of \u00c3 with\n\n\f8\n\nALEXANDER VASIL'EV\n\nM. As a consequence, \u00c3 is a homogeneous space under the left action of Diff S 1 ,\nsee [1, Theorem 1.4.1] and [9]\u2013[12]. As it has been mentioned in Section 2, see also\n[26], a smooth subodination evolution is governed by the L\u00f6wner-Kufarev equation\n(1) with a function p(\u03b6, t) which may be Schwarz represented by its boundary values\n\u03c1(ei\u03b8 , t), such that 4\u03c0\u03c1 \u2208 Vect S 1 .\nTheorem 1.

The Virasoro algebra is spanned by elements\nek = \u03b6 1+k \u2202, k \u2208 Z and c with ek + e\u2212k , where c is a real number, called the central\ncharge, and the Lie brackets are defined by\nc\n[em , en ]V ir = (n \u2212 m)em+n + m(m2 \u2212 1)\u03b4n,\u2212m , [c, Lk ] = 0.\n12\nThe Virasoro algebra (V ir) can be realized as a central extension of Vect S 1 by\ndefining\nc\n[\u03c6\u2202 + ca, \u03c8\u2202 + cb]V ir = (\u03c6\u03c8 \u2032 \u2212 \u03c6\u2032 \u03c8)\u2202 + \u03c9(\u03c6, \u03c8),\n12\n(whereas [\u03c6, \u03c8] = \u03c6\u03c8 \u2032 \u2212 \u03c6\u2032 \u03c8), where the bilinear antisymmetric form \u03c9(\u03c6, \u03c8) on\nVect S 1 is given by\nZ2\u03c0\n1\n(\u03c6\u2032 + \u03c6\u2032\u2032\u2032 )\u03c8d\u03b8,\n\u03c9(\u03c6, \u03c8) = \u2212\n4\u03c0\n0\n\nand a, b are numbers. This form defines the Gelfand-Fuks cocycle on Vect S 1 and\nsatisfies the Jacobi identity. The factor of 1/12 is merely a matter of convention.\nThe manifold M being considered as a realization \u00c3 admits affine coordinates\n{c2 , c3 , . . . }, where ck is the k-th coefficient of a univalent functions f \u2208 \u00c3. Due to\nde Branges' theorem [5], M is a bounded open subset of {|ck | < k + \u03b5}.\nThe Goluzin-Schiffer variational formula lifts the actions from the Lie algebra\nVect S 1 onto \u00c3. Let f \u2208 \u00c3 and let \u03bd(ei\u03b8 ) be a C \u221e real-valued function in \u03b8 \u2208 (0, 2\u03c0]\nfrom Vect S 1 making an infinitesimal action as \u03b8 7\u2192 \u03b8 + \u03c4 \u03bd(ei\u03b8 ). Let us consider a\nvariation of f given by\n\u00132\nZ \u0012 \u2032\nf 2 (\u03b6)\nwf (w)\ndw\n\u03bd(w)\n(13)\nL\u03bd [f ](\u03b6) = \u2212\n.\n2\u03c0i\nf (w)\nf (w) \u2212 f (\u03b6) w\nS1\n\nKirillov and Yuriev [11, 12] have established that the variations L\u03bd [f ](\u03b6) are closed\nwith respect to the commutator and the induced Lie algebra is the same as Vect S 1 .\nMoreover, Kirillov's result [9] states that there is the exponential map Vect S 1 \u2192\nDiff S 1 such that the subgroup S 1 coincides with the stabilizer of the map f (\u03b6) \u2261 \u03b6\nfrom \u00c3.\nIt is convenient [10] to extend (13) by complex linearity to CVect S 1 \u2192 Vect \u00c3.\nTaking \u03bdk = \u2212ieik\u03b8 , k \u2265 0 from the basis of CVect S 1 , we obtain the expressions\nfor Lk = \u03b4\u03bd f , f \u2208 \u00c3 \u2243 M (see formula (13)), as\nL0 = \u03b6f \u2032 (\u03b6) \u2212 f (\u03b6),\n\nLk = \u03b6 1+k f \u2032 .\n\nThe computation of Lk for k < 0 is more difficult because poles of the integrant.\nFor example,\nL\u22121 = f \u2032 \u2212 1 \u2212 2c2 f,\n\nL\u22122 =\n\n1\nf\u2032\n\u2212 \u2212 3c2 + (c22 \u2212 4c3 )f,\n\u03b6\nf\n\n(see, e.g., [10]). In terms of the coordinates {c2 , c3 , . . . } on M\nLk = \u2202k +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(n + 1)cn \u2202k+n ,\n\nn=1\n\nfor k > 0, where \u2202k = \u2202/\u2202ck+1 .\n\nL0 =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=1\n\nncn \u2202n ,\n\n\fENERGY CHARACTERISTICS OF SUBORDINATION CHAINS\n\n11\n\nNeretin [16] introduced the sequence of polynomials Pk , in the coordinates\n{c2 , c3 , . . . } on M by the following recurrent relations\nc\nLm (Pn ) = (n + m)Pn\u2212m + m(m2 \u2212 1)\u03b4n,m , P0 = P1 \u2261 0, Pk (0) = 0,\n12\nwhere the central charge c is fixed. This gives, for example, P2 = 2c (c3 \u2212 c22 ),\nP3 = 2c(c4 \u2212 2c2 c3 + c32 ). In general, the polynomials Pk are homogeneous with\nrespect to rotations of the function f . It is worthy to mention that estimates of\nthe absolute value of these polynomials has been a subject of investigations in the\ntheory of univalent functions for a long time, e.g., for |P2 | we have |c3 \u2212 c22 | \u2264 1\n(Bieberbach 1916 [3]), for estimates of |P3 | see [7, 14, 23, 24]. For the Neretin\npolynomials one can construct the generatrix function\nP (\u03b6) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nPk \u03b6 k =\n\nk=1\n\nc\u03b6 2\nSf (\u03b6),\n12\n\nwhere Sf (\u03b6) is the Schwarzian derivative of f , Let \u03bd \u2208 CVect S 1 and \u03bd g be the\nassociated right-invariant tangent vector field defined at g \u2208 Diff S 1 . For the basis\n\u03bdk = \u2212ieik\u03b8 \u2202, one constructs the corresponding associated right-invariant basis \u03bdkg .\nBy {\u03c8\u2212k } we denote the dual basis of 1-forms such that the value of each form on\nthe vector \u03bdkg is given as\n(\u03c8k , \u03bdng ) = \u03b4k+n,0 .\nLet us construct the 1-form \u03a8 on Diff S 1 by\n\u03a8=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(Pk \u25e6 \u03c0)\u03c8k ,\n\nk=1\n\nwhere \u03c0 means the natural projection Diff S 1 \u2192 M. This form appeared in [1, 2] in\nthe context of the construction of a unitarizing probability measure for the Neretin\nrepresentation of M. It is invariant under the left action of S 1 . If f \u2208 \u00c3 represents\ng and \u03bd \u2208 Vect S 1 , then the value of the form \u03a8 on the vector \u03bd is\n(\u03a8, \u03bd)f =\n\nZ2\u03c0\n\ne2i\u03b8 \u03bd(ei\u03b8 )Sf d\u03b8,\n\n0\n\nsee [1, 2].
