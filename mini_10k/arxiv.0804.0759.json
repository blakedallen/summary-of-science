Such stimulus-specific adaptation is tantamount to taking advantage of statistical regularities in order to encode the highest possible amount\nof information about the signal ([2, 3, 22, 23, 34]) under\nvarious constraints. The constraints include, for example, minimizing energy expenditure ([18, 20, 21]), minimizing wiring costs between processing units ([19]), or\nreducing spatial and temporal redundancies in the input\nsignal ([1, 2, 5, 17, 28]).\nIn the case of visual stimuli, natural images reveal a statistical regularity that corresponds to an approximately\nlinear decrease of their amplitude spectra as a function\nof spatial frequency when scaling both coordinate axis\nlogarithmically ([7, 11]). This property is equivalent to\nstrong pairwise correlations between pairs of luminance\nvalues ([35]). It has been proposed that visual neurons\nutilize this statistical property in a way that cells tuned\nto different spatial frequencies have equal sensitivities\n([11]). Thus, neurons tuned to high spatial frequencies should increase their response gain such that they\nachieve the same response levels as low frequency neurons. This is the response equalization hypothesis (which\nshould be distinguished from the decorrelation hypothesis) ([1, 14, 28]). Response equalization (\"whitening\")\nmay enhance the information throughput from one neuronal stage to another by adjusting the output of one\nstage such that it matches the limited dynamic range of\nthe successive stage ([14]).\nThe present article unveils a link between statistical properties of face images and psychophysical data for the processing of face identity. The processing of face identity\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: mats@cvc.uab.es\n\nwas found to preferably depend on a narrow spatial frequency band (about 2 octaves) from 8 to 16 cycles per\nface ([9, 10, 12, 16, 24, 25, 26, 30]). However, to the best\nof my knowledge, no explanation has been offered yet of\nwhy it is that face processing mechanisms in the human\nbrain reveal such a preference.\nHere I analyzed the amplitude spectra of a large number of face images. Different types of amplitude spectra\nwere considered - with and without suppression of external face features (hair, shoulders, etc.). The spectra were\nwhitened (i.e., \"response\"-equalized) according to three\ndifferent procedures. In this way it is demonstrated that\nthe main results are largely independent of the specific\nmethod that was used for whitening: amplitudes were\nhigher at spatial frequencies around 10 cycles per face\n- but only in those spectra where external face features\nwere suppressed. Therefore, the effect must have been\nproduced by internal face features (eyes, mouth, nose).\n\nII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nAmplitude spectra\n\nAmplitude spectra are best conceived in polar coordinates, where the spatial frequency k varies proportional\nto radius. Thus, spectral amplitudes which have the same\nspatial frequency lie on a circle. The 2-D spectrum can\nbe collapsed into an 1-D isotropic spectrum for each k by\naveraging all amplitudes on that circle. This means that\nin an isotropic spectrum any orientation dependence of\nthe amplitudes is lost.\nThe amplitude spectra of natural images were found to\ndepend on spatial frequency as \u221d k \u03b1 , with an average\n(isotropic) spectral slope \u03b1 \u2248 \u22121 ([7, 11]).\nHow do the amplitude spectra of face images compare to\nthis finding? To answer, I computed slopes of the amplitude spectra of 868 female and 868 male face images\n(size 256 \u00d7 256).

(a) Logarithmized, mean amplitude spectrum of all female\nface images. Prior to computing individual spectra, a Blackman-Harris (B.H.-) window was applied to each face image in order\nto suppress external face features (Supp. Fig. 7d ). The application of the B.H.-window, however, leaves an undesired spectral\n\"fingerprint\" in each of the spectra (Supp. Fig. 5a), which was attenuated before averaging (Supp. Fig. 6).\n(b) The 2-D spectrum shown on the left is transformed into a 1-D isotropic spectrum by averaging all amplitudes with different\norientations at a fixed frequency k (= circle symbols). The size of each circle symbol is proportional to the standard deviation\n(s.d.). The maximum s.d. (biggest circle) was 9186.75 (39.3%), and the minimum s.d. (smallest circle) was 252.67 (28.08%).\nIn the legend, e denotes slope values \u03b1 (i.e., \u03b1 \u2261 e). For comparison, the typical slope of natural images (e = \u22121) is also\nshown as a dashed gray line. The label \"vanilla\" refers to line fitting with an ordinary linear regression (least square fit)\nalgorithm for computing slopes. Since linear regression is sensitive to outliers, slope values were additionally computed with\nan outlier-insensitive (=robust) algorithm.

Two possibilities\nfor computing these values were considered: \"slopes\" means that individual slope values were averaged (each gender n = 868,\nc.f. Supp. Fig. 9), and \"spectra\" refers to the slope of the average spectrum as illustrated with Figure 1(a) .\n\nthese spectra also decreased approximately linear as a\nfunction of spatial frequency (Figure 1). Therefore a line\nwith (spectral) slope \u03b1 could be fitted to each spectrum.\nFour different types of amplitude spectra were considered for each face image (with different \u03b1, see table I and\nmethods section).\nAt first the spectra of the original images were computed\n(\"raw'). The second type of spectrum is defined by attenuating in each spectrum the truncation artifacts (\"corr.\nraw\", Supp. Fig. 5c and Supp. Fig. 6). These artifacts are a consequence of the cropped shoulder region\nbeing displayed in each image besides the actual face. To\nsmoothly strip off external face features (like the hair,\ni.e. anything but the actual face), a Blackman-Harris\nwindow was applied to each image prior to computing\nits spectrum (\"Blackman-Harris\" or \"B.H.\" \u2013 see Supp.\nFig. 7d ). Because application of the B.H.-window leaves\na faint but characteristic spectral \"fingerprint\" (Supp.\nFig. 5a), a further spectrum type (\"corr. B.H.\") was\nconsidered, with the artificial \"fingerprint\" being attenuated.\nThe mean isotropic slope values were computed in two\n\nways. First, the spectral slope of each face image was\ncomputed, and individual slope values were averaged (label \"slopes\" in table I). Second, an average spectrum is\ncomputed at first, which is composed of all individual\nspectra (see Figure 1). The second slope value corresponds then to the slope of the average spectrum (label \"spectra\" in table I). Isotropic slope values are situated around \u22121.6, with minima and maxima of \u22122.014\n& \u22121.180 (females), respectively, and \u22121.994 & \u22121.007\n(males).\nNotice that the standard deviations associated with the\nslopes of arbitrary natural images are usually bigger\n([31, 33]), as there is no restriction on displayed content\nand scale, respectively ([32]).\nUsually, \u03b1 varies also as a function of orientation \u0398\n([29, 33]). The orientation dependence is illustrated by\nmeans of the averaged corrected spectra (Figure 2). Minimum slope values are located at 0o (wave vector pointing\nto east) and 90o (north), respectively, whereas maxima\ntend to be at oblique orientations.

The curves juxtpose oriented spectral slopes from corrected raw (\"corr.raw\") spectra\nand corrected Blackman-Harris-windowed (\"corr.B.H.\") spectra (see legend). Slopes were computed from the respective\naveraged spectra, with angular increments of 30o ([33]). Error\nbars denote \u00b11 standard deviation (estimated using robust\nstatistics). Uncorrected spectra show similar dependencies of\nslopes from orientation. Notice that slope values are defined\nmodulus 180o .\n\ntra, minimum slopes are associated with the orientations\nof the internal face features (0o , 180o: nose; 90o , 270o:\neyes, mouth, and the bottom termination of the nose).\nSummarizing so far, the majority of the individual \u03b1 for\nface images is more negative than the theoretically predicted lower bound of \u22121.5 for natural images ([4]) (table I; Supp. Fig. 9). Similar observations also hold for\nspectral slopes of the mean amplitude spectra (Figure 1).\nThis should not come as a surprise since the structure of\nface images is different from natural images: face images are not composed of self-occluding, constant intensity surface patches ([4, 27]), and lack the self-similar\ndistribution of spectral energy as it was reported for natural images ([11]).\n\nWhitening the Amplitude spectra\n\nHere I ask whether by amplitude equalization of amplitude spectra (\"whitening\") one could explain psychophysical data on face perception. The results which\nare presented below were obtained with the mean spectra.\nConsider first the isotropic (1-D) spectra. Because the\nspectra fall, as a function of spatial frequency k, as\n\u221d k \u2212|\u03b1| , we can multiply amplitudes by k |\u03b1| to obtain\na \"flat\" spectrum (in the sense that its Shannon entropy\nis maximal). The slopes which were used to this end are\nthe \"spectra\" ones from table I. Whitened 1-D spectra\nare shown in Figure 3. They are not completely flat, but\ninstead have a global maximum at around 10 cycles per\nface, and a second but local maximum at around 30 cycles per face.\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\ncycles/face\n\norientation [degrees]\n\nFIG. 3: 1-D whitening. Whitening of the corrected mean,\nisotropic 1-D spectra reveals a global amplitude maximum\nat \u2248 10 cycles per face with all four spectra (see legend).\nSymbol size is proportional to standard deviation (relative\nvalues are indicated in the figure). The slopes which were\nused for whitening are indicated in the legend (c.f. table I).\n\nConsider now the 2-D spectra, where whitening was carried out according to three different procedures: whitening by slopes (analogous to the 1-D case), by variance,\nand by diffusion (see methods section). Results are\nshown in Figure 4 for females, and in Supp. Fig. 10\nfor males. For both genders, the whitened B.H.-spectra\nreveal amplitude maxima only within a narrow band of\nlow spatial frequencies. Furthermore, frequency maxima\nappear only at a specific orientation in the spectra which\ncorresponds to horizontally oriented face features (\"horizontal amplitudes\", i.e. eyes and mouth). These results\nare obtained independently from the specific whitening\nprocedure which was used (slope-whitening: Figure 4a\n& Figure 10a; variance-whitening: Supp. Fig. 11; diffusion-whitening: not shown).\nPlotting of only these \"horizontal amplitudes\" (indicated\nby a white box in Figure 4a) for all three whitening\nprocedures allows to identify the spatial frequencies of\nthe maxima with higher precision. The curves now show\nclearly that the maxima occur in the range from 10 to\n15 cycles per face height. Nevertheless, maxima are only\nrevealed by whitening of the B.H.-windowed spectra, but\nnot by whitening of any raw spectra. This means that\namplitude enhancement due to internal face features is\nannihilated by the presence of external face features (such\nas hair or shoulder).\n\nIII.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nHere, I studied amplitude spectra of face images in the\ncontext of response equalization (whitening). Were external face features (hair, shoulder) suppressed by windowing the face images with a Blackman-Harris window, then\namplitude maxima are observed in the whitened spectra\nat low spatial frequencies.

(b) The curves show the\namplitudes at the location demarcated by the white box in the spectrum: \"log(spectrum)\" are the logarithmized amplitudes\nwithout whitening; amplitudes whitened \"by slope\", \"by variance\", and \"by diffusion\" (see methods sections for further details\non the three whitening procedures). The important result here is that whitened amplitudes reveal a distinct maxima irrespective\nof the specific whitening method at \u2248 10 \u2212 15 cycles per face height. The variance-whitened spectra are shown in Supp. Fig. 11.\n\ntra, maxima are situated around 10 cycles per face, and\nfor the 2-D spectra at around 10 \u2212 15 cycles per face\nheight. In the 2-D case, three different whitening methods yielded consistent results.\nSeveral psychophysical studies suggest that recognition\nof face identity works best in a narrow band (bandwidth\nabout 2 octaves) of spatial frequencies from \u2248 8 to \u2248 16\ncycles per face ([9, 12, 13, 16, 24, 26, 30]). Notice that\nthis does not mean that face recognition exclusively depends on this frequency band, as faces can still be recognized when corresponding frequency information is suppressed ([24, 25]).\nBecause the amplitude maxima appear in the whitened\nspectra exclusively at horizontal feature orientations, my\nresults suggest that the psychophysical frequency preference might have been caused by an adaptation of corresponding neuronal mechanisms to eyes and mouth.\nInterestingly, in the earlier cited psychophysical studies\nthe spatial frequencies are often measured in \"cycles per\nface width\" (i.e., along vertically oriented face features),\nwhereas the results presented here were rather brought\nabout by horizontally oriented face features. The factors\nto convert spatial frequencies from \"cycles per image\" to\n\"cycles per face\" (see methods) are statistically different\nfor width and height (as suggested by a one-way ANOVA\nand a Kruskal-Wallis test). However, they are not so different in absolute terms. The aforementioned frequency\ninterval of 10 \u2212 15 cycles per face height transforms into\n\u2248 9\u221213.5 cycles per face width for females and \u2248 9\u221213.6\ncycles per face width for males, respectively, what is still\nin good agreement with the psychophysical data.\nPsychophysical thresholds for face recognition are not\nsignificantly affected by the structure of the background\nin which a face is embedded ([8]). Therefore, although\nthe faces used in this study are shown against an uniform background, the validity of results should extend\n\nto arbitrary backgrounds. Notice, however, that amplitude spectra consider the complete frequency content of\nan image, whereas humans have attentional mechanisms\nwhich allows them to process only a region of interest,\nand ignore background effects. Windowing the face images with a Blackman-Harris window achieves the the\nsame computational purpose: anything but the internal\nface features are suppressed. A follow-up paper examines\nin more detail the properties of internal face features by\nmeans of a model of simple and complex cells.\nThe statistical prediction of a preferred band of spatial\nfrequencies may also have implications for artificial face\nrecognition systems. Future experiments should systematically address the question whether the recognition performance of artificial systems is optimal at spatial frequencies similar to those used by humans.\n\nMethods\nFace images. We used 868 female face images, and 868 male\nface images from the Face Recognition Grand Challenge database\n(FRGC, http://www.frvt.org/FRGC or www.bee-biometrics.org).\nOriginal images (1704 \u00d7 2272 pixels, 24-bit true color) were adjusted for horizontal alignment of eyes, before they were downsampled to 256 \u00d7 256 pixels and converted into 8-bit grey-scale.\nSubsequently, the positions of left eye, right eye, and mouth\n[(xle , yle ), (xre , yre ), and (xmouth , ymouth ), respectively] were manually marked by two persons (M.S.K. and E.C.) with an ad hoc\nprogrammed graphical interface. The position of each face center\n(\u2248 nose) was approximated as xnose = rnd((xle +xre )/4+xmouth /2)\nand ynose = rnd[0.95 \u2217 rnd(yle + (ymouth \u2212 (yle + yre )/2)/2), where\nrnd(*) denotes rounding to the nearest integer value.\nDimension of spatial frequency. For conversion of spatial\nfrequency units, face dimensions were manually marked with an\nad hoc programmed graphical interface. The factors for multi-\n\n\f5\nplying \"cycles per image\" to obtain \"cycles per face width\" were\n0.41 \u00b1 0.013 (females, n = 868) and 0.43 \u00b1 0.012 (males, n = 868).\nCorresponding factors for obtaining \"cycles per face height\" were\n0.46 \u00b1 0.021 (females) and 0.47 \u00b1 0.018 (males). Conversion factors\nat oblique orientations were calculated under the assumption that\nhorizontal and vertical conversion factors define the two main axis\nof an ellipse. Pooling of results over gender implied also a corresponding averaging of conversion factors, and the factors for width\nand height were averaged in the isotropic case.\nAmplitude spectra. Let the features which are not part of the\nactual face be denoted by external features (e.g., shoulder region\nor hair). On the other hand, internal features refer to the eyes, the\nmouth, and the nose. The presence of external features in our face\nimages influences in their amplitude spectra, and may cause truncation artifacts. It is thus desirable to compare results with and\nwithout the presence of external features. A good suppression of\nexternal features could be achieved by centering a minimum 4-term\nBlackman-Harris window ([15]) at (xnose , ynose ) (Supp. Fig. 7 &\n8). Nevertheless, application of the window leaves a characteristic \"fingerprint\" in each spectrum (Supp. Fig. 5a). This artificial \"fingerprint\", as well as the spurious lines caused by truncation, could be attenuated with a correction procedure based on a\nspatially varying diffusion mechanism (outlined below). Thus, for\neach face image, originally four types of amplitude spectra were\nconsidered: the original \"raw\" spectrum, the \"Blackman-Harris\"spectrum, and their respective corrected versions (i.e., \"corr. raw\"\nand \"corr. B.H.\").\nCorrection of Amplitude Spectra. Let P \u2208 {0, 1}n\u00d7n be a\nbinary n \u00d7 n matrix of the same size as the 2-D amplitude spectra\nA. In P , artifacts are represented by ones, while all other positions are set to zero. Thus, P is set to the image shown in Supp.\nFig. 5(b) for correcting the Blackman-Harris spectrum, and Supp.\nFig. 5(c) for the raw spectrum. The idea of the correction algorithm consists in simply averaging out the positions with artifacts.\nTo this end, information from neighboring positions flows into artifact positions. This process is called inward diffusion. Let X (t) be\na sequence of corrected amplitude spectra parameterized over time\nt, with the initial condition X (0) \u2261 A. Inward diffusion is defined\nby \u2202Xij /\u2202t = Pij \u22072 Xij , where (i, j) denotes matrix positions. The\ndiffusion process was terminated at the moment when the correlation difference c(t) \u2212 c(t + \u2206t) was smaller than 0.001, or when a\nmaximum of 100 iterations were done.\nSlopes of amplitude spectra. Isotropic slopes \u03b1: Amplitudes\nassociated with a given spatial frequency lie on a circle. This is to\nsay that when representing the spectrum with polar coordinates,\nthen spatial frequencies vary along the radial coordinate, but stay\nconstant while varying orientation. An isotropic amplitude spectra\nis obtained by averaging all amplitudes with a fixed spatial frequency across orientations (i.e., for each circle, the mean value of\nall amplitudes of the circle was computed). Because the logarithmized amplitude spectra of face images fall approximately linear as\na function of log-frequency, a line with slope \u03b1 could be fitted to the\n\n[1] Atick, J. and Redlich, A. 1992. What does the retina\nknow about natural scenes? Neural Computation, 4:196\u2013\n\nisotropic spectra. Although in principle amplitude data were available from k = 1 to k = 127 cycles per image, only the interval from\nkmin = 8 to kmax = 100 was used for line fitting. I used the function \"robustfit\" (linear regression with low sensitivity to outliers)\nprovided with Matlab's statistical toolbox (Matlab version 7.1.0.183\nR14 SP3, Statistical Toolbox version 5.1, see www.mathworks.com).\nOriented spectral slopes \u03b1(\u0398) (Figure 2): Each 2-D amplitude spectrum was subdivided into 12 \"pie slices\" (each with \u2206\u0398 = 30o ).\nFor each pie slice with orientation \u0398, an (oriented) isotropic 1-D\nspectrum was analogously computed as just described (with amplitudes being averaged across arcs), and subsequently a line with\nslope \u03b1(\u0398) was fitted.\nSlope-Whitening of Amplitude Spectra. This algorithm proceeds in straight analogy to whitening of the isotropic spectra.\nLet \u03b1 be the isotropic slope value corresponding to a 2-D amplitude spectrum A(kx , ky ) with spatial frequency\ncoordinates kx ,\nq\n\nky \u2208 [1, 127] cycles per image. Let k = kx2 + ky2 (radial spatial\nfrequency). Then, the corresponding whitened spectrum W is defined as W(kx , ky ) = A(kx , ky ) * k |\u03b1| . Qualitatively, the W were\nnot different from a more advanced procedure that consisted in\nsubdividing A into oriented \"pie slices\" and whitening each with\nits corresponding oriented slope value \u03b1(\u0398). Therefore, only those\nresults are presented where A was whitened with an isotropic slope\nvalue (the term \"isotropic\" in the headline of the spectra in Figure 4 and Supp. Fig. 10 indicates just this).\n\nWhitening by Variance. Amplitudes in the spectrum A(kx , ky )\nwith\nequal spatial frequencies lie on a circle with radius k =\nq\nkx2 + ky2 . Let nk be the number of points on this circle (nk monotonically increases as a function of k). Let A(k, \u0398) be the spectrum\nin polar coordinates. Then, we first average, for each k, all amP\nplitudes across orientations according to \u03bc(k) =\n\u0398 A(k, \u0398)/nk .\nP\n2\nThe variance is subsequently computed as \u03c3 (k) = \u0398 (A(k, \u0398) \u2212\n\u03bc)2 /(nk \u2212 1). Finally, the variance-whitened spectrum is defined as\nV = A/(\u03c32 (k) + \u01eb) with a small positive constant \u01eb \u226a 1. Examples\nof V are shown in Supp. Fig. 11.\nWhitening by Diffusion. Let X (kx , ky , t) a sequence of amplitude spectra parameterized over time t, with the initial condition\nX (kx , ky , 0) \u2261 A(kx , ky ). For t > 0, the X are defined according\nto the diffusion equation \u2202X /\u2202t = \u22072 X . The whitened spectrum\nthen is D \u2261 A/(1 + X (tmax )) at precisely the instant tmax when\nthe Shannon entropy of D is maximal.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work was partially supported by the Juan de la\nCierva program from the Spanish Government (BKCIYK-6707).

(c) Erasing all external face features led to the creation\nof a \"moonface\", thereby suppressing all of the artificial lines (g) . Finally, in (d ) , a minimum 4-term Blackman-Harris window\nwas centered at the nose position of the original image. The corresponding amplitude spectrum (h) of the windowed image is\nvery similar to the amplitude spectrum of the \"moonface\" spectrum (but see Supp. Fig. 8).\n\n\f4\n\n(a)\nFIG. 8: Similarities between the logarithmized amplitude spectra of \"moonfaces\" and windowed faces. For six selected female images which revealed strong line artifacts in their amplitude spectra, I computed similarity measures between the\nlogarithmized amplitude spectra of corresponding \"moonfaces\" (e.g., Supp. Fig. 7g) and windowed faces (e.g., Supp. Fig. 7h;\nthe window type is specified by the numbers at the abscissae). The plot shows mutual information averaged across the the six\nimages (mean \u00b1 s.d.). The center of the window was either positioned always at the center position of each image (\"rigid\"),\nor at the nose position with variable radius (\"adaptive\") \u2013 see legend. The minimum 4-term Blackman-Harris window scored\nthe highest similarity (indicated by a red star).
