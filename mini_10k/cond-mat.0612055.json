Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and\nanomalous Hall effect measurements indicate that these GaMnAs films have the nature of\nintrinsic ferromagnetic semiconductors with high ferromagnetic transition temperature up to\n170 K.\n\nIII-V-based ferromagnetic semiconductor (FMS) GaMnAs1,2 is a good model system\nfor future spintronic devices. Recently, large tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR)34- 5 and\nTMR oscillation induced by the resonant tunneling effect6 were observed in GaMnAs-based\nsingle-barrier and double-barrier heterostructures, respectively. These results indicate that\nthe FMS heterostructures are very promising for future quantum devices using spin degrees of\nfreedom. For realizing such devices operating at room temperature, however, it is important\nto increase the Curie temperature (TC) of Ga1-xMnxAs, which is limited nowadays to 173 K (at\nx=8%).7 The mean-field Zener model8 of carrier-mediated ferromagnetism predicts that TC\nof Ga1-xMnxAs is proportional to xp1/3, where p is the hole concentration and x is the Mn\nconcentration, thus higher TC values are expected in GaMnAs with a higher Mn concentration\nif sufficiently high hole concentration is obtained. In fact, in the Mn \u03b4-doped AlGaAs/GaAs\nmodulation-doped heterostructure where a high Mn content is locally achieved within a few\nMLs, high TC values of 192-250 K were reported.9 Meanwhile, the growth of Ga1-xMnxAs\nalloy films with x>10% has been very difficult because precipitation of hexagonal MnAs\nclusters more easily occurs during growth with higher x. Until now, no papers have been\n1\n\n\fpublished on Ga1-xMnxAs alloys with x>10%.\nIn this letter, we report the successful growth and properties of Ga1-xMnxAs-alloy\nfilms with high x ranging from 12.2 to 21.3%. In order to prevent the precipitation during\ngrowth, samples were grown by decreasing the growth temperature TS to as low as 150-190oC\nand by reducing the film thickness d to 10 nm.10 We measured the magneto-optical and\nmagnetotransport properties, indicating that these GaMnAs films with high x have intrinsic\nFMS features like GaMnAs with low x (<10%). Furthermore, we found that post-growth\nannealing is very effective to increase TC of these heavily Mn-doped GaMnAs, and high TC\nvalues up to 170 K were obtained by annealing these samples.\nThe heavily Mn-doped Ga1-xMnxAs films with x=12.2, 15.2, 17.6, and 21.3% were\ngrown by low-temperature molecular-beam epitaxy (LT-MBE) with the growth conditions\nshown in Table I. The growth procedure was as follows. We grew a GaAs buffer layer on\na semi-insulating GaAs(001) substrate at 600oC, and decreased TS to 150-190oC. After that,\na 10-nm thick Ga1-xMnxAs thin film was grown on this buffer layer. In the cases of x=17.6%\nand 21.3%, a 1-nm thick GaAs-cap layer was grown on the top of GaMnAs layer in order to\nprevent the formation of the MnAs clusters by segregated Mn atoms on the surface after the\ngrowth. The Mn concentration x was determined by the relationship between the Mn flux\nand Mn cell's temperature, and the Mn flux data were precisely estimated by measuring the\nthickness of epitaxial MnAs films grown in our MBE system. Figure 1 shows the reflection\nhigh-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) pattern during the growth of Ga0.824Mn0.176As.\nThe RHEED pattern was streaky 1\u03bc1 or 1\u03bc2, indicating two-dimensional growth of\nsingle-crystal films without phase decomposition or precipitation.2 After the MBE growth,\nthese samples were annealed in air at TA=140-160oC for long hours (tA~100 h), and their\npost-growth annealing conditions are also described in Table I. We measured the TC values\nof these samples before and after annealing with various tA (0-350 h), and confirmed that TC\ncompletely saturates at the annealing times shown in Table I in all the samples.\nWe carried out magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) measurements in a reflection\nsetup. Here, the MCD intensity is expressed as\nMCD [deg] =\n\n90 R+ \u2212 R\u2212\n1 dR\n\u221d \u2206E\n,\n\u03c0 R+ + R\u2212\nR dE\n\n(1)\n\nwhere R+ and R- are optical reflectance for \u03c3+ and \u03c3- circularly polarized light, respectively,\n\u2206E is the Zeeman splitting energy, R is the total reflectance, and E is the photon energy.\nSince MCD is proportional to dR/dE, the MCD spectrum is strongly associated with the band\nstructure of the measured material. From the shape of the MCD spectrum and its magnetic\nfield dependence, we can distinguish whether the measured magnetization comes from FMS\nor from magnetic precipitations. Since MCD is directly proportional to the Zeeman splitting\n\u2206E which is proportional to vertical component of magnetization M, the magnetization\ncharacteristics (corresponding to M-H curves) can be obtained from the magnetic field\ndependence of the MCD intensity. The existence of the Zeeman splitting of the host\nsemiconductor-like bandstructure is one of the most essential features of FMS. Thus, by\ncarrying out careful MCD characterizations, we can obtain the direct evidence for 'intrinsic'\n\n2\n\n\fFMS, where the ferromagnetism comes from the FMS not from magnetic precipitations.11\nFigure 2(a) shows the MCD spectra of annealed Ga0.878Mn0.122As measured at 11 K\nwith the magnetic fields of 1 kOe (dotted black curve), 3 kOe (thin grey curve), and 10 kOe\n(thick black curve) applied perpendicular to the film plane. As a reference, the MCD\nspectrum of Ga1-xMnxAs with low x of 0.074 at 5 K is shown in Fig. 2(c).12 In all the spectra\nof Fig. 2(a), two broad negative peaks at around 1.9-2.0 eV and 3 eV are seen, corresponding\nto the optical transitions at \u0413 and \u039b critical points, respectively. These spectral shapes are\nvery similar to that obtained in GaMnAs with low x shown in Fig. 2(c), indicating that the\nband structure of annealed Ga0.878Mn0.122As is of zinc-blende type, just as GaMnAs with low\nx. On the other hand, the energy positions of these MCD peaks of heavily Mn-doped\nGaMnAs shown in Fig. 2(a) are shifted by 0.2-0.3 eV to higher energy from those of GaMnAs\nwith low x. (Fig. 2(c)) We found that this blue shift occurs also by the post-growth\nannealing. In the MCD spectrum of the as-grown Ga0.878Mn0.122As (not shown), MCD peaks\nwere observed at 1.8 and 2.9 eV, which are lower than those of the annealed Ga0.878Mn0.122As.\nThe blue shift at around the E0 energy is probably partly due to the change of the carrier\nconcentration, i.e. by the Moss-Burstein shift induced by the increase of the Fermi energy,\nwhich is higher than the valence band in terms of hole energy.13 But the reason for the blue\nshift at around the E1 energy is not clear at present (The band gap energy at \u039b is probably\nmodified by heavy Mn doping). Figure 2(b) shows MCD spectra with various magnetic\nfields shown in Fig. 2(a) when normalized by the intensity at 1.9 eV. The MCD spectra at\nany magnetic field can be superimposed on a single spectrum over the whole photon-energy\nrange. This indicates that the MCD signal comes from the FMS phase of GaMnAs, not from\nother materials,14 which means that the intrinsic FMS feature is maintained in GaMnAs even\nwith such a high Mn concentration. We confirmed that this intrinsic FMS feature is\nmaintained also in other GaMnAs samples with high x (12.2%-21.3%) investigated in this\nstudy.\nFigure 3 shows the magnetic-field dependence of the MCD intensity (\u2202M ) of the\nannealed Ga0.878Mn0.122As with a photon energy of 3.0 eV at various temperatures of 30 K\n(blue curve), 90 K (green curve), 130 K (yellow curve), and 170 K (red curve) with a\nmagnetic field applied perpendicular to the film plane. Clear ferromagnetic order with the\nin-plane easy magnetization axis was observed up to 170 K.\nFigure 4 shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity of the heavily\nMn-doped GaMnAs samples grown in this study. Thin curves are those of as-grown samples\nand thick curves are those of annealed samples. In all the GaMnAs samples with various\nMn concentrations investigated here, resistivity was remarkably decreased after the\npost-growth annealing, meaning that the Mn interstitial (MnI) defects, which act as double\ndonors and compensate holes, decreased by annealing. During the annealing process, the\nMnI atoms are diffused to the free sample surface and are passivated by oxidation.1516 -,1718\nOn the other hand, in both of the as-grown and annealed samples, there is a tendency that\nresistivity increases with increasing the Mn concentration x.\nWe carried out the anomalous Hall effect measurements for these GaMnAs samples\nwith a van der Pauw method. (The Hall resistance RHall vs. magnetic field B data was\n3\n\n\fobtained by extracting the odd-function component from the raw Hall resistance Rraw vs. B\ndata in order to exclude the component of the even-function magnetoresistance.19) In FMS\nmaterials, RHall can be approximated by RHall \u2248 c\u03c1(B)nM/d when temperature is below TC,\nwhere c is a constant, \u03c1(B) is the resistivity, and n is a constant related to the scattering\nmechanism. If \u03c1(B) does not largely depend on B in the range of B used in the\nmeasurements, the RHall-B curve should be equivalent to the MCD-B curve, because both of\nRHall and MCD is directly proportional to M. This is also a very important feature of FMS.\nThe black solid curves shown in Fig. 3 are the RHall-B curves of annealed Ga0.878Mn0.122As at\n30, 90, 130, and 170 K. The shapes of the RHall-B curves (black) at all the temperatures are\nin almost perfect agreement with the MCD-B curves (colors).\nIn order to determine the exact TC value of the annealed Ga0.878Mn0.122As, we carried\nout the Arrott plot (RHall2 vs. B/RHall) with the anomalous Hall effect data. Note that RHall is\ndirectly proportional to M below TC, thus the RHall2 vs. B/RHall plot corresponds to the\nconventional Arrott plot (M2-B/M). 20 The Arrott plot is shown in the inset of Fig. 3,\nindicating that TC of this annealed Ga0.878Mn0.122As sample is 170 K, which is close to the\nhighest record TC of GaMnAs.7\nIn Table I, we show TC values of the as-grown and annealed GaMnAs samples\nobtained by the above mentioned method. The TC values of all the samples were\nsignificantly increased by the low-temperature annealing. However, TC does not increase but\ndecreases with increasing x against the prediction of the mean field theory, which means that\nthe MnI defect concentration of our samples increases with increasing x. This result\nindicates that the Mn atoms are more likely to be incorporated into the interstitial site than\ninto the substitutional site with increasing x (or decreasing TS). The reason that TC does not\nincrease with x even in the annealed samples is probably because there is an upper limit of the\nquantity of the MnI atoms which can be passivated by oxidation. For obtaining higher TC in\nsuch a high x region, it is important to find a way to remove the MnI defects more effectively.\nIn summary, we have successfully grown the GaMnAs films with a high Mn\nconcentration from 12.2 to 21.3% by decreasing the growth temperature to 150-200oC and by\nreducing the film thickness to 10 nm. MCD and anomalous Hall effect measurements of\nthese films indicate that GaMnAs maintains an intrinsic FMS feature even in such a high\nMn-concentration region. High TC values up to 170 K were observed in these samples\nannealed in air at 160oC for ~100 h.\nThis work was partly supported by PRESTO/SORST of JST, Grant-in-Aids for\nScientific Research, IT Program of RR2002 of MEXT, and Kurata-Memorial Hitachi Science\n& Technology Foundation.\n\nReferences\n1\n\n2\n\nH.

Growth- and annealing conditions and the obtained TC values of the heavily\nMn-doped Ga1-xMnxAs samples investigated in this study. d, TS, TA and tA are the film\nthickness of the GaMnAs layer, the growth temperature, the annealing temperature, and the\nannealing time, respectively. These TC values were estimated by the anomalous Hall effect\nmeasurements. The description of \"<20\" in the TC item means that we could not estimate\nthe exact TC value because the resistivity was too high to measure in our measurement setup.\nx (%)\n12.2\n15.2\n17.6\n21.3\n\nGa1-xMnxAs\nd [nm] TS [oC]\n10\n190\n10\n168\n10\n167\n10\n152\n\nTC [K]\nAnneal conditions\nAs grown annealed TA[oC] Time tA [h]\n77\n170\n160\n123.5\n69\n169\n160\n95\n20\n144\n140\n114\n< 20\n125\n140\n118\n\nFigure captions\nFIG. 1.
