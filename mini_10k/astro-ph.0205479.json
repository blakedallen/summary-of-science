Villata et al.: The WEBT BL Lac Campaign 2000\n\n3\n\nAbstract. We present U BV RI light curves of BL Lacertae from May 2000 to January 2001, obtained by 24 telescopes\nin 11 countries. More than 15000 observations were performed in that period, which was the extension of the Whole\nEarth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) campaign originally planned for July\u2013August 2000. The exceptional sampling reached\nallows one to follow the flux behaviour in fine details. Two different phases can be distinguished in the light curves: a\nfirst, relatively low-brightness phase is followed by an outburst phase, after a more than 1 mag brightening in a couple\nof weeks. Both the time duration (about 100 d) and the variation amplitude (roughly 0.9 mag) are similar in the two\nphases. Rapid flux oscillations are present all the time, involving variations up to a few tenths of mag on hour time\nscales, and witnessing an intense intraday activity of this source. In particular, a half-mag brightness decrease in about\n7 h was detected on August 8\u20139, 2000, immediately followed by a \u223c 0.4 mag brightening in 1.7 h. Colour indexes have\nbeen derived by coupling the highest precision B and R data taken by the same instrument within 20 min and after\nsubtracting the host galaxy contribution from the fluxes. The 620 indexes obtained show that the optical spectrum is\nweakly sensitive to the long-term trend, while it strictly follows the short-term flux behaviour, becoming bluer when the\nbrightness increases. Thus, spectral changes are not related to the host galaxy contribution, but they are an intrinsic\nfeature of fast flares. We suggest that the achromatic mechanism causing the long-term flux base-level modulation can\nbe envisaged in a variation of the relativistic Doppler beaming factor, and that this variation is likely due to a change\nof the viewing angle. Discrete correlation function (DCF) analysis reveals the existence of a characteristic time scale of\nvariability of \u223c 7 h in the light curve of the core WEBT campaign, while no measurable time delay between variations\nin the B and R bands is found.\n\n1. Introduction\nBL Lacertae is a well-known source that has been observed in the optical band for more than a century. It\nhas been used to define a whole class of active galactic\nnuclei (AGNs), which are characterized by absence or extreme weakness of the emission lines, intense variability\nat all wavelengths, high polarization, and superluminal\nmotion of radio components. The BL Lacertae objects,\ntogether with the flat-spectrum radio quasars, are known\nas \"blazars\".\nAlthough the details of blazar emission are under debate, the commonly accepted general scenario foresees a\ncentral black hole fed by an accretion disc, and a plasma\njet which is responsible for the non-thermal continuum. In\norder to explain several observational evidences, the emitted radiation is assumed to be relativistically beamed towards us. The low-energy emission, from the radio band to\nthe UV\u2013X-ray region, is likely synchrotron radiation produced by ultra-relativistic electrons in the jet. The origin\nof the higher-energy radiation, up to \u03b3-rays, is less clearly\nestablished: it is reasonable to suppose that the soft radiation produced by the synchrotron process can be inversely\ncomptonized up to the \u03b3-ray energies (SSC models), but it\nis also possible that the photons to be comptonized come\nfrom out of the jet, either directly from the accretion disc\nor from the broad line region (EC models). Recent observations seem to indicate that a mixture of SSC and\nEC processes may be at work in the blazar jets (see e.g.\nMadejski et al. 1999 and B\u00f6ttcher & Bloom 2000 for the\ncase of BL Lacertae). Another possibility is that the highenergy emission is produced by pair cascades coming from\nthe interaction between soft photons and highly relativistic protons (proton models).\nThe violent flux variations observed in blazars have\nbeen explained in a variety of ways: shocks travelling\ndown the jet (e.g. Marscher 1996), changes of the Doppler\nfactor due to geometrical reasons (e.g. Dreissigacker &\nCamenzind 1996; Villata & Raiteri 1999), accretion disc\n\ninstabilities (e.g. Wiita 1996), gravitational microlensing\n(e.g. Schneider & Weiss 1987). The observation of microvariability, that is of flux changes on time scales of less\nthan a day, raises the question of what is the smallest time\nscale of variability in blazars and, if the variations are of\nintrinsic nature, of how small the size of the emitting region can be.\nVariability studies are thus a powerful tool to investigate blazar emission and to discriminate among the various theoretical interpretations, in particular when observations are done in a continuous way and simultaneously\nat different wavelengths. This is why in the last years optical observers have set up collaborations to make the observational effort more efficient.\nThe Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT; http://\nwww.to.astro.it/blazars/webt/) is an international organization that includes about 30 observatories located all\naround the world. Its aim is to obtain accurate and continuous monitoring of a source during a time-limited campaign (from few days to several weeks), which is often\norganized in concert with satellite observations in the Xand \u03b3-rays, and ground-based observations in the radio\nband and at TeV energies. The location at different longitudes of its members allows them to optimize observations\nduring the 24 hours of the day, gaps due to daylight being,\nin theory, extremely small. In practice, limitations due to\nbad weather conditions, telescope overscheduling, technical problems are present, but in any case this monitoring strategy has already demonstrated that it can provide\nunprecedentedly dense sampling (see Villata et al. 2000\nabout the WEBT campaign on S5 0716+71 of February\n1999, and Raiteri et al. 2001 about the first-light WEBT\ncampaign on AO 0235+16 of November 1997), and even\nbetter results are expected by the robotization of at least\nsome of the telescopes participating in the WEBT.\nIn this paper we report on U BV RI photometric monitoring of BL Lacertae during the summer 2000 WEBT\ncampaign and its extension (May 2000 \u2013 January 2001).\nThe core optical campaign took place simultaneously with\n\n\f4\n\nM. Villata et al.: The WEBT BL Lac Campaign 2000\n\nthe planned high-energy campaign coordinated by M.\nB\u00f6ttcher, involving X-ray and TeV observatories such as\nBeppoSAX, RXTE, CAT, and HEGRA (B\u00f6ttcher et al.\n2002). Previous WEBT campaigns on BL Lacertae had\nbeen organized in June 1999, in conjunction with observations by the BeppoSAX and ASCA satellites (Mattox\n1999). The results of these campaigns are presented in\nRavasio et al. (2002) and Villata et al. (2002).\nThe present paper is organized as follows: in Sect. 2\nwe review optical studies on BL Lacertae; the observing\nstrategy and data reduction/assembling procedures are\ndescribed in Sect. 3. U BV RI light curves are presented\nin Sect. 4, colour indexes are discussed in Sect. 5, and the\nautocorrelation study can be found in Sect. 6. Discussion\nand conclusions are drawn in Sect. 7.\n\n2. BL Lacertae\nThe AGN BL Lacertae lies within an elliptical galaxy\n(Miller et al. 1978), at a distance z = 0.0688 \u00b1 0.0002\n(Miller & Hawley 1977). Ejection and evolution of four\nhighly-polarized superluminal radio components moving\non curved trajectories have been observed by Denn et al.\n(2000) with the VLBA.\nOne puzzling feature is that, although BL Lacertae\nstands as the prototype of a whole class of objects in which\nemission lines are absent or extremely weak, on some occasions broad H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 emission lines were found in\nits spectrum, raising the issue of its membership to the\nclass named after it (Vermeulen et al. 1995). Corbett et\nal. (2000) analysed eight spectra taken over a period of 30\nmonths, from June 1995 to December 1997, and found that\nthe equivalent width of the H\u03b1 line varies approximately\ninversely with the optical continuum flux: this suggests\nthat the broad-line region is likely not photoionized by\nthe beamed synchrotron radiation of the jet (which nevertheless cannot be ruled out), but by radiation coming\nfrom the hot accretion disc.\nBL Lacertae has been observed for more than a century in the optical band, and it is well known for its intense\nvariability on both long (months, years) and short (days or\nless) time scales. Since the early work by Racine (1970),\nmicrovariability was detected in optical observations of\nthis source. Miller et al. (1989) observed a 0.12 mag variation in 1.5 h.\nCarini et al. (1992) reported on 17 years of optical\nmonitoring, in which the source exhibited \"erratic\" behaviour, its V magnitude varying between 14.0 and 16.0.\nFrom their B \u2212 V versus V plot no well-defined correlation between brightness and colour appeared, but a\n\"bluer when brighter\" trend is recognizable. The authors\nsearched for microvariability, and found several episodes\nof variations as fast as 0.1 mag h\u22121 , the most rapid rate of\nchange observed being 0.19 mag h\u22121 .\nBV RI photometry of BL Lacertae in 1993\u20131995 was\npresented by Maesano et al. (1997), confirming the spectral flattening for a flux increase.\n\nA big observing effort was undertaken during the summer 1997 broad optical outburst, announced by Noble et\nal. (1997). Subsequent circulars reported on high flux levels also in the \u03b3- and X-rays (Hartman et al. 1997; Grove\n& Johnson 1997; Madejski et al. 1997; Makino et al. 1997).\nWebb et al. (1998) carried out BV RI observations during the outburst, and found that variations were simultaneous in all bands, but of higher amplitude at the higher\nfrequencies, and that there was a marginal evidence of a\nspectral flattening when the source brightens. These two\nlatter features were recognized also in the microvariability events detected by Nesci et al. (1998) and Speziali\n& Natali (1998), presenting variations up to 0.4 mag h\u22121 .\nV R observations on 11 nights in July 1997 were performed\nby Clements & Carini (2001), who detected nightly variations from 0.1 to 0.6 mag. They also found that BL Lac\nbecame bluer when brighter and commented that it is not\nclear whether the colour changes can be ascribed to the\nAGN or are rather due to a greater contribution from\nthe underlying galaxy when the AGN is fainter. An extremely fast brightening of 0.6 mag in 40 min was detected\nby Matsumoto et al. (1999) on August 2, 1997, inside a\nlarger flux increase of more than 1 mag between 17 and 19\nUT, confirmed by Ghosh et al. (2000). In the same night,\nthe decreasing phase of the flare was observed by Massaro\net al. (1998) and Speziali & Natali (1998) as a variation of\nmore than half a mag in about 2 h (see also Ghosh et al.\n2000). Rapid and large-amplitude flux variations were also\nobserved by Sobrito et al. (1999) and Tosti et al. (1999).\nThese papers also contain extended light curves during\nthe 1997 outburst.\nDuring the optical outburst, the EGRET instrument\non the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory revealed a\n\u03b3-ray flux more than 4 times the previous detection,\nand a harder spectrum than before (Bloom et al. 1997).\nMoreover, a noticeable \u03b3-ray flux increase observed on\nJuly 18\u201319 apparently preceded by several hours a brief\noptical flare. The RXTE and ASCA satellites detected\nan X-ray flux respectively 2\u20133.5 times and more than 3\ntimes higher than measured by ASCA in 1995 (Madejski\net al. 1999; Tanihata et al. 2000). The multiwavelength\nspectrum of BL Lac during the July 1997 outburst was\nexamined by B\u00f6ttcher & Bloom (2000) in terms of a homogeneous jet model.\nIntraday variability was found also the next year, in\nsummer 1998, when the source was in a fainter state\n(Massaro et al. 1999; Nikolashvili et al. 1999).\nV RI photometry of BL Lacertae in 1997\u20131999 was\npresented by Fan et al. (2001): they detected microvariations with amplitude decreasing with increasing wavelength. They also analysed the correlation among bands,\nfinding no time delay longer than 0.2 d.\nAn analysis of colour variability of BL Lac during the\n1997 and 1999 outbursts was performed by Hagen-Thorn\net al. (2002). They showed that in both cases the spectral energy distribution remained unchanged during the\noutburst, and that the spectrum was flatter in the more\npowerful outburst of 1997.\n\n\fM. Villata et al.: The WEBT BL Lac Campaign 2000\n\nSince BL Lacertae is one of the few blazars for which\ntime-extensive light curves exist, a number of investigations have been devoted to the search for periodicities in\nits flux variations.\nRecurrent variations every 0.31, 0.60, and 0.88 yr were\nrecognized by Webb et al. (1988) by means of a discrete\nFourier transform (DFT) analysis of their light curves,\nextending from June 1971 to January 1985. No evidence\nof periodicity was found instead by Carini et al. (1992).\n\"Whitening\" of time series was the method used by\nMarchenko et al. (1996; see also Hagen-Thorn et al. 1997)\nto search for periodicities in a 20-year long light curve of\nBL Lac: they found that only a long-term component of\nP = 7.8 \u00b1 0.2 yr is statistically significant.\nIn their study of the long-term optical base-level fluctuations in AGNs, Smith & Nair (1995) identified a bestfit, well-defined cycle of 7.2 yr for the baseline meanderings\nshown by the 20-year BL Lac light curve of the Rosemary\nHill Observatory. It is interesting to notice that the mere\napplication of the Fourier analysis led the authors to derive a period of 7.7 yr, in fair agreement with the results\nobtained by Marchenko et al. (1996).\nFan et al. (1998) analysed the historical optical light\ncurve of BL Lacertae with the Jurkevich method and derived a long-term period of \u223c 14 yr.\n\n3. Observations during the WEBT campaign\nOriginally, the WEBT campaign was planned for the period July 17 \u2013 August 11, 2000, that is from one week before to one week after the planned high-energy campaign\n(B\u00f6ttcher et al. 2002). Simultaneous observations were\nalso performed in the radio band from the University of\nMichigan Radio Astronomy Observatory (UMRAO) and\nfrom the Mets\u00e4hovi Radio Observatory, in Finland.\nAt the campaign start, BL Lacertae was in a relatively\nfaint phase. A subsequent, considerable brightening of the\nsource in late September 2000 caused a campaign extension up to January 2001.\nData were finally collected from May 2000 to January\n2001.\nTable 1 shows the list of observatories which participated in the WEBT campaign. The name and country of\nthe observatory (Column 1) is followed by the telescope\ndiameter (Column 2), by the total number of observations\ndone (Nobs , Column 3), and by the number of data points\nin U BV RI derived, sometimes after binning (Columns 4\u2013\n8).\n\n3.1. Observing strategy\nThe participating observers were suggested to perform optical observations alternately in two bands (Johnson's B\nand Cousins' R, but other R filters were also accepted) in\norder to obtain a BR sequence of frames throughout each\nobserving night. Exposure times were chosen in view of a\ngood compromise between high precision and high temporal density. In those cases where high precision would have\n\n5\n\nrequired gaps of 15\u201320 min in each light curve, it was suggested that observations be obtained in the R band only.\nAs a matter of fact, intensive B monitoring was considered to be appropriate only for telescopes larger than 1 m.\nMoreover, at the beginning and end of the BR (or R-only)\nsequence, a complete set of filters (U )BV RI (JohnsonCousins when possible) was suggested in order to follow\nthe whole optical spectrum behaviour of the source.\n\n3.2. Data reduction and assembling\nData were collected as instrumental magnitudes of the\nsource and reference stars, in order to apply the same\nanalysis and calibration procedures to all datasets. Frame\npre-reduction, i.e. bias/dark correction and flat-fielding,\nwas performed by the observers. Instrumental magnitudes\nwere obtained by either standard aperture photometry\nprocedures or Gaussian fitting, in most cases by the observers themselves.\nA minority of data came from photometer observations: these data were provided directly as standard magnitudes\nA careful data assembling was required, since the\nwhole dataset consisted of more than 15000 observations\ncoming from 22 different observatories, 24 different telescopes, and 25 different detectors.\nThe analysis was performed through the following\nsteps:\n\u2013 Obtaining standard magnitudes of BL Lac from instrumental ones. Stars B C H K originally identified\nby Bertaud et al. (1969; their b c h k) were used as\nreference stars for the magnitude calibration of the\nsource. The photometry adopted was that published by\nBertaud et al. (1969) for the U and B bands, and the\none from Fiorucci & Tosti (1996) for the V RI bands1 .\n\u2013 Discarding bad and unreliable points.\n\u2013 Binning the data when needed.\n\u2013 Check of the final light curves for each observatory (see\nTable 1 for the relevant data numbers).\n\u2013 Putting together different datasets, night by night.\n\u2013 Estimating the offsets existing among different\ndatasets (see Table 2) from overlapping data, and correcting them, night by night.\n\u2013 Discarding less precise data in favour of higherprecision simultaneous data.\nTable 3 shows the number of data points remained\nin the various bands at the end of the data assembling\nprocedure (to be compared with the totals of Table 1,\nwhere the last step of the assembling procedure is not\nconsidered), and the minimum and maximum magnitudes\nreached.\n\n1\n\nIn the error calculation, calibration errors were not taken\ninto account, since the main goal was to analyse flux variations,\nrather than to obtain a precise evaluation of the magnitude.\n\n\f6\n\nM.

U BV RI light curves\nThe U BV RI light curves of BL Lacertae from May 2000\nto January 2001 are presented in Fig. 1. It is possible to\nidentify two well-defined phases: the first one starts with\na moderate brightness increase, and sees the source in a\nrelatively low brightness state; it ends after one hundred\ndays, when the brightness drops to the minimum value\n(JD = 2451788, R = 14.50). After that, a rapid brightening of more than 1 mag in a couple of weeks leads to the\noutburst phase, lasting again about one hundred days. The\nlast available observations witness a final dimming to the\npre-outburst levels.\nIn both the two mentioned phases, flux oscillations of\nseveral tenths of mag on day time scales are present, and\nit is interesting to notice that the total variation amplitude is approximately the same (about 0.9 mag) in the\npre-outburst and in the outburst periods, similar to the\nresults reported for the 1997 outburst of BL Lac (Miller\n1999).\n\nOne striking feature of Fig. 1 is the exceptional sampling obtained during the core WEBT campaign of July\u2013\nAugust 2000, especially in the R band.\nThe details of the brightness behaviour in the R band\nduring the core WEBT campaign are visible in Fig. 2.\nThe most spectacular variability was detected (with high\nprecision and very good intranight sampling) during the\nlast part of the campaign, plotted in the lower panel of Fig.\n2. The boxes indicate periods of particularly interesting\nvariations, which are shown in subsequent figures.\nData taken on August 1\u20132, August 6\u20137, and August\n8\u20139, 2000 are plotted in Figs. 3, 4, and 5, respectively.\nThe participating observatories are distinguished by different symbols demonstrating how the observing task moves\nfrom east to west as the Earth rotates.\nOne can notice that, in principle, it is possible to obtain a full-day observing coverage, when both the most\neastern and western observatories work, thus succeeding\nin filling the \"Pacific gap\". In practice, this gap is often\npresent in the WEBT light curve, but it is limited to a few\nhours, which allows one to follow the brightness behaviour\nalmost continuously.\nThe most impressive variations were detected on\nAugust 8\u20139: a half-mag brightness fall in about 7 h, immediately followed by a very steep brightening of \u223c 0.4 mag\nin 1.7 h.\nBy looking at the individual flaring episodes in the\nlight curve of Fig. 2, we can see that the most signif-\n\n\fM.

Moreover, one can notice that, in general,\nrising slopes are steeper than dimming ones. However,\nsince the observed events might be the result of the superposition of different \"single\" flares, any speculation about\nthe time scales of the underlying brightening and dimming\nmechanisms is likely not very significant.\n\n5. Colour indexes\nWe have seen that the brightness behaviour of BL\nLacertae in the period examined here appears as the superposition of rapid flares, typically lasting for about a\nday or less, on a long-term trend, which is responsible\nfor a transition from a relatively low brightness level to\na higher brightness level around JD = 2451800. It is now\ninteresting to analyse the data in order to understand if\nthe mechanism causing rapid flares is of the same nature\nas the one determining the long-term flux variations. One\npiece of information is likely to come from colour index\n\nanalysis, which can reveal whether flux variations imply\nspectral changes or not.\nSince the BL Lacertae host galaxy is relatively bright,\nwe first subtracted its contribution from the observed\nfluxes in order to avoid contamination in the colour indexes.\nAccording to Scarpa et al. (2000), the R magnitude\nof the BL Lacertae host galaxy is Rhost = 15.55 \u00b1 0.02,\nadopting a host galaxy colour V \u2212 R = 0.61; Mannucci et\nal. (2001) derived an average effective colour for elliptical\ngalaxies with MV < \u221221 of B \u2212 V = 0.99 \u00b1 0.05. The\ninferred B-band host galaxy magnitude is thus Bhost =\n17.15.\nActually, the above magnitudes represent extrapolations to infinity, while an aperture radius of 8 arcsec (to\nbe compared with the 4.8 arcsec half-light galaxy radius\ngiven by Scarpa et al. 2000) was suggested in the data\nreduction for the source measure, together with radii of\n10 and 16 arcsec for the edges of the background annulus.\nBy using these parameters and a de Vaucouleurs r1/4 pro-\n\n\f8\n\nM. Villata et al.: The WEBT BL Lac Campaign 2000\n\nFig. 3. Light curve of BL\nLacertae in the R band on\nAugust 1\u20132, 2000\n\nFig. 4. Light curve of BL\nLacertae in the R band on\nAugust 6\u20137, 2000\n\nfile, we estimated that the host galaxy contribution to the\nobserved fluxes is only 59.65% of the whole galaxy flux.\nWe then transformed both the observed and the host\ngalaxy B and R magnitudes into dereddened fluxes by using the coefficient of Galactic extinction in the B band\nAB = 1.420 given by NED and by deriving extinction in\nthe Cousins' R band by means of Cardelli et al. (1989):\nAR = 0.9038. Fluxes relative to zero-mag values were\ntaken from the photometric calibration of Bessell (1979).\nThe B and R host galaxy fluxes (2.175 mJy and 4.266 mJy,\nrespectively) were reduced by a factor 0.5965 and then\n\nsubtracted from the observed fluxes, and the point source\n(reddened) magnitudes derived from the \"cleaned\" fluxes.\nB \u2212 R colour indexes were calculated by coupling B\nand R data taken by the same instrument within 20 min\n(in most cases the time separation between the coupled\ndata is in the range 2\u20134 min). Only B and R data with\nerrors not greater than 0.04 and 0.03 mag, respectively,\nwere considered.\nThe plot of the resulting 620 B \u2212 R indexes as a function of time (see Fig. 6) suggests that colours are more\nsensitive to rapid variations than to the long-term trend.\n\n\fM. Villata et al.: The WEBT BL Lac Campaign 2000\n\n9\n\nFig. 5. Light curve of BL\nLacertae in the R band on\nAugust 8\u20139, 2000\nFig. 6. Temporal evolution of B \u2212 R colour index (upper panel) and R magnitude (lower panel) after subtracting the host\ngalaxy contribution from the fluxes\n\nMoreover, during well sampled flares the B \u2212 R index\nstrictly follows the flux behaviour, as shown by Fig. 7,\nwhich presents an enlargement of Fig. 6 during the fourth\nweek of the core WEBT campaign. In this sense, we can\nsay that fast flares are due to a chromatic mechanism,\nwhich causes a spectral flattening when the source brightens.\nFigure 8 (upper panel) shows the B \u2212 R versus R plot.\nPoints are distributed over two separated regions of the\nfigure, according to the brightness level of the source, with\na boundary at R \u223c 14.1. However, inside each region,\nthe colour indexes seem to follow a trend with a similar\nslope: a bluer-when-brighter behaviour, as already noticed\nin Fig. 7 for the short-term flares. On the contrary, the\nlong-term variations appear as essentially achromatic.\nIn order to verify the supposed existence of two different mechanisms acting on different time scales, we have\ntried to model the long-term trend as a modulated base\ncontribution to the source flux density, on which the shortterm flares are superposed. We expect that, once fluxes are\ncorrected for this contribution, the B \u2212 R versus R plot\nwill contain the signature of one component only, i.e. the\nchromatic one.\nThe first step has been to define a flux base level lapping on the flux minima of the R light curve.\nData in the R band were first binned daily for removing\neffects due to intranight dense sampling, and then binned\nover 10 d; the binned light curve was then fitted with a\ncubic spline interpolation (Press et al. 1992). The R light\ncurve was divided into two zones, corresponding to the\npre-outburst (JD < 2451790) and outburst phases. The\n\npreviously derived spline was then proportionally rescaled\nto pass through the minima of each zone. The result can\nbe seen in Fig. 9, where the upper, grey (green in the electronic version) line traces the original cubic spline interpolation, while the lower, dark (blue) line shows the rescaled\nspline, representing the pursued base-level modulation due\nto the achromatic mechanism mentioned above2 .\nThe same spline was used to find the base-level modulation for the B-band fluxes, by proportionally rescaling\nit to pass through the minimum flux. The resulting flux\nratio of the base levels is FR /FB = 2.332 (B \u2212 R = 1.787).\nBy seeing Fig. 9, one might object that only a few minimum points are very close to the base level, even when the\nsampling is good and many local minima could be identified. The point is that local minima are most likely not\nstates where the flaring activity is out: they are presumably due to the superposition of different events started\nat different times. On the contrary, the detection of \"no\nflaring\" may be a very rare event, if ever happens.\nFluxes were then \"corrected\" for their respective base\nlevels by subtracting the shaded (yellow) area shown in\nFig. 9 from the R fluxes, and analogously for the B fluxes.\n\"Corrected\" B \u2212 R and R values were finally obtained by\nB\u2212R = 2.5 log (FR /FB )+0.868, R = \u22122.5 log FR +17.125,\n2\n\nA 10 d smoothing time scale appeared as the most suitable\nchoice: a shorter one would have been too sampling dependent;\na longer one would have smoothed too much the evident longterm variations which are visible in the best-sampled periods.\nIn any case, changes of the binning interval in the range 5\u201330 d\ndo not affect the final results sensitively.\n\n\f10\n\nM. Villata et al.: The WEBT BL Lac Campaign 2000\n\nFig. 7. Temporal evolution of\nB\u2212R colour index (upper panel)\nand R magnitude (lower panel)\nduring the last week of the core\nWEBT campaign, after subtracting the host galaxy contribution from the fluxes\n\nwhere the constants take both the zero-mag fluxes and the\nGalactic extinction coefficients into account.\nThe new B \u2212 R versus R plot is shown in Fig. 8 (middle panel): apart from a few points mainly coming from\nthe low-brightness peak of the spline (red triangles, see\ncaption to the figure), most of the points are now following a single linear trend, confirming the starting assumption that an achromatic mechanism produces the baselevel variations.\nHowever, one can notice that the distribution of data\npoints corresponding to the outburst phase [grey (green)\ncrosses] still extends to higher brightness levels. This is the\nconsequence of the greater amplitude exhibited by the flux\nvariations in the outburst state (see Fig. 9). We have already noticed that, in the logarithmic scale of magnitudes,\nvariation amplitudes are comparable in the pre-outburst\nand in the outburst phases, which means that flux amplitudes are proportional to the flux level.\nWe can thus further refine our model for the flux baselevel variations, by assuming that the achromatic mechanism is also responsible for the brightness-dependence of\nthe variation amplitudes. A simple explanation for this is\nobtained by assuming that the base-level oscillations are\nthe result of the variation of the relativistic Doppler factor \u03b4 = [\u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b2 cos \u03b8)]\u22121 , where \u0393 is the Lorentz factor\nof the bulk motion of the plasma in the jet and \u03b8 is the\nviewing angle, since fluxes are enhanced proportionally to\na certain power of \u03b4 by relativistic boosting.\nIn order to clean the observed fluxes for this effect, we\nderived \"corrected\" fluxes by rescaling each original flux\nby the ratio between the minimum value of the spline and\nthe value of the spline at the considered time. In this way,\nwe obtain fluxes normalized to the value of \u03b4 where the\nspline has its minimum, thus eliminating the effects of the\n\nFig. 10.

The resulting \"cleaned\"\nlight curve is shown in Fig. 10: the variation amplitude is\nnow comparable over all the period, which should mean\nthat we are now seeing the behaviour of the chromatic\ncomponent alone.\nAs for the colour indexes, we derived B \u2212 R and R values from corrected fluxes as already done in the previous\ncase; the bottom panel of Fig. 8 displays the final result:\nall data fall in a narrower brightness range, as expected,\nand the linear correlation appears better defined.\n\n6. Time correlations\nIn the Introduction we mentioned a number of studies devoted to the search for periodicities in the BL Lacertae\nlight curves. The derived periods range from 0.31 to 14 yr.\nThe light curves obtained by the WEBT collaboration extend to \u223c 240 d, so that possible periodicities longer than,\nsay, a couple of months cannot be looked for. On the other\nhand, the dense sampling allows one to test the existence\nof characteristic times of variability down to very short\nperiods.\nWe applied the discrete correlation function (DCF)\nmethod (Edelson & Krolik 1988; Hufnagel & Bregman\n1992) to the BL Lacertae fluxes, paying attention to\nthe edge effects, as warned by Peterson (2001). Figure\n11 shows the autocorrelation of the uncorrected, galaxysubtracted R-band fluxes, with a 100 d maximum lag. The\n\n\fM. Villata et al.: The WEBT BL Lac Campaign 2000\n\n11\n\nFig. 8.

Autocorrelation function for the R-band fluxes\nafter subtracting the host galaxy contribution and correcting for Doppler factor variation\n\nbe affected by the lack of information during observing\ngaps.\nIn the above analysis we have neglected that not only\nfluxes, but also time scales are affected by Doppler boosting. A reliable temporal analysis should take this into account.\nIt is known that time intervals are changed by a factor\n\u03b4 \u22121 by relativistic Doppler effect. Under the assumption\nthat fluxes F are modified proportionally to \u03b4 3 , we have\n1/3\n1/3\nthat \u03b4(t)/\u03b4min = [F (t)/Fmin ]\n= [s(t)/smin ] , where\ns(t) is the value of the spline representing the flux baselevel variations at time t, and smin is the spline minimum.\nConsequently, the corrected time t\u2032n for the n-th data point\ncan be calculated as\n\uf8eeR\n\uf8f91/3\ntn\ns(t)\ndt\nt\n\uf8fb\nt\u2032n = t\u2032n\u22121 + \u2206tn \uf8f0 n\u22121\n,\n\u2206tn smin\n\ncentral, wide maximum tells us that the R light curve continues to correlate with itself for time shifts shorter than a\nmonth; for larger time lags the pre-outburst phase starts\nto overlap significantly with the outburst one, and the\nDCF drops to negative values, implying anticorrelation.\nNo significant feature appears, which means that no reliable characteristic variability time scale is found.\nCorrection of fluxes for variation of the Doppler factor\nas described in the previous section removes the signature\nof the long-term trend. As one can see in Fig. 12, where\nthe autocorrelation for the corrected R-band fluxes is presented (zoomed on smaller time lags), also in this case no\nsignificant time scale is recognizable.\nHowever, if we restrict the DCF analysis to the data\nfrom the core WEBT campaign (see Fig. 2), we see that\na not negligible signal comes out at a \u223c 7 h time scale,\nas shown by Fig. 13. This feature is particularly evident\nin the second and fourth weeks of the core campaign.\nNevertheless, one has to notice that its significance might\n\nwhere \u2206tn = tn \u2212 tn\u22121 is the observed time interval between the (n \u2212 1)-th and n-th data points.\nBy applying the above time correction to the R-band\nlight curve, the total duration of the observing period dilates from 241.71 to 285.57 d.\nAs for the R-band flux autocorrelation, time correction\ndoes not introduce any significant change in the results:\nthe \u223c 7 h characteristic time scale of variability is confirmed, and no other signal comes out.\nFinally, DCF analysis has been applied to search for\nthe possible existence of time delays between the flux variations in the B and R bands: no significant measurable\n(greater than a few minutes) delay has been found.\n\n7. Discussion and conclusions\n15625 (= 56 ) observations were performed in the period May 2000 \u2013 January 2001 by 24 telescopes of the\nWEBT collaboration to monitor the optical variability of\nBL Lacertae.\n\n\fM. Villata et al.: The WEBT BL Lac Campaign 2000\n\nAn exceptional sampling was reached, especially during the core WEBT campaign (July 17 \u2013 August 11, 2000),\nwhere time gaps were limited to a few hours and they were\nessentially due to the lack of observers in the Pacific area.\nWell-defined intranight trends were detected, with\nvariations up to 0.4 mag in less than 2 h.\nColour index analysis performed after subtracting the\nhost galaxy contribution from fluxes suggests the existence of at least two variability mechanisms: the first\none is essentially achromatic, and is responsible for the\nlong-term trend, while the second one, causing the fast\nflares superposed on the long-term trend, implies spectral\nchanges, the spectrum becoming flatter when the source\ngets brighter. A similar behaviour was already found in\nthe BL Lac object S5 0716+71 by Ghisellini et al. (1997).\nAs mentioned in the Introduction, Clements & Carini\n(2001) argued that the bluer-when-brighter behaviour\nmight be due to a greater host galaxy contribution when\nthe AGN is fainter. Since we subtracted the host galaxy\ncontribution and still found the bluer-when-brighter trend\n(and only for short-term variations), we conclude that\nspectral changes are not related to the host galaxy contribution, but are an intrinsic property of fast flares.\nThe behaviour of the achromatic component determining the flux base-level modulations can be interpreted in\nterms of variation of the relativistic Doppler factor \u03b4. By\nassuming that fluxes are enhanced proportionally to \u03b4 3\nby relativistic boosting, a maximum variation of \u03b4 of a\nfactor 1.36 is inferred. This change in \u03b4 can be due to either a viewing angle variation of few degrees (\u2206\u03b8 \u223c 1\u20134\u25e6)\nor a noticeable change of the bulk Lorentz factor (more\nthan 50%). From this point of view our interpretation\nwould suggest that the flux base-level modulations are\nmore likely explained by a geometrical effect than by an\nenergetic one.\nIn a geometrical scenario such as that proposed by\nVillata & Raiteri (1999), where viewing angle variation\nis due to rotation of an inhomogeneous helical jet, a rate\nof few degrees (say, 1\u20133\u25e6 ) in a month (as can be inferred\nfrom the steepest base-level variations, see Fig. 9) would\nimply an upper limit to a possible periodicity of 10\u201330 yr.\nIndeed, in that model, a perfect helix would give rise to a\nperfect periodicity of well-defined outbursts; if the helical\npath presents distortions, the outburst phase (which can\nlast for a significant fraction of the period) is consequently\ndisturbed by modulated events whose steepest variations\nrepresent a lower limit to the rotation rate.\nWe performed discrete autocorrelation analysis in order to search for the existence of intermediate-short characteristic time scales in our observing period. Variability\non a typical time scale of \u223c 7 h was found during the core\nWEBT campaign.\nCross-correlation analysis on the B and R fluxes does\nnot reveal any significant time lag between variations in\nthe two bands.\nAcknowledgements.
