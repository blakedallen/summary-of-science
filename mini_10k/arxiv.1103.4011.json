The inter-atomic, or inter-molecular, interactions in a liquid are strong, and therefore strongly affect\nthe liquid energy. At the same time, the interactions are\nsystem-specific, hence the calculation of liquid energy requires the explicit knowledge of the interactions. For\nthis reason, it is argued [1] that no general expressions\nfor liquid energy can be obtained, in contrast to gases\nand solids.\nAccording to current theoretical understanding, liquids are strikingly different from both gases and solids.\nIndeed, small atomic displacements in a solid make it\npossible to expand the energy in terms of phonons and\nobtain general expressions for solid energy. On the other\nhand, this has largely considered to be impossible to do in\nliquids where atomic displacements are large. Similarly,\nsmall interactions in gases make it possible to treat interactions as a perturbation and obtain general expressions\nfor the corrections to the system energy. On the other\nhand, this has not been useful for liquids with strong interactions and solid-like densities. An apt summary of\nthis state of affairs, attributed to Landau, is that liquids \"have no small parameter\". Perhaps for this reason,\nliquid heat capacity is not, or is barely, mentioned in statistical physics textbooks as well as books dedicated to\nliquids [1\u20136]. This observation is shared by Granato [7],\nwho further comments on the challenge faced by teachers\nto discuss liquid heat capacity in class.\nThe experimental behavior of liquid heat capacity is interesting. The heat capacity per atom decreases from approximately 3kB per atom at the melting point to about\n2kB at high temperature, as witnessed by the data of\nmany simple liquids [8, 9]. Similar behavior is also seen\nin complex liquids [10]. The decrease of heat capacity\nwas observed in molecular dynamics simulations [11, 12].\n\n\u2217 e-mail:\n\nd.bolmatov@qmul.ac.uk\n\nLiquid heat capacity has also been discussed by considering liquid potential energy landscape with inter-valley\nmotions [9].\nTheoretically, liquids have been viewed to occupy an\nintermediate state between gases and solids. Liquids are\nfluid, and therefore might intuitively appear closer to\ngases in terms of their properties. On the other hand,\nunless they are close to critical point, liquids have solidlike densities and can support shear waves at high frequencies. The question of how best to treat real dense\nliquids, i.e. approach them from the gas or solid state,\nhas a long history [2].\nHistorically, liquids have predominantly been approached from the gas state, by developing schemes to\ncalculate the interaction energy in addition to gas kinetic\nenergy [1\u20136]. This approach relies on the knowledge of\ninteratomic interactions as well as correlation functions\n[13, 14]. These are not generally available, apart from\nsimple model systems, as discussed below in more detail. When they are available, it is not apparent how\nthis approach explains the experimental decrease of heat\ncapacity from 3kB to 2kB at high temperature.\nAn alternative approach to liquids was pioneered by\nFrenkel [2], and is based on liquid relaxation time \u03c4 . \u03c4\nis the average time between two consecutive local structural rearrangements in a liquid at one point in space. In\nthis picture, a liquid is approached from the solid state\nbecause locally, liquid structure remains unchanged, i.e.\nthe same as in a solid, during time shorter than \u03c4 . An important advantage of this approach is that strong interactions are included in the consideration from the outset.\nThis is in contrast to the approach from the gas state\nthat attempts to calculate the interaction energy from\ncorrelation functions and interatomic interactions.\nFrenkel noted that as \u03c4 continuously increases (if crystallization is avoided) beyond the experimental time\nscale, a liquid becomes a solid for practical purposes.\nHence, a solid is different from a liquid only quantitatively but not qualitatively. Frenkel subsequently stated:\n\"...the classification of condensed bodies into solids and\nliquids... has a relative meaning convenient for practical purposes but devoid of scientific value\" [2]. Novel for\n\n\f2\nthat time, this view might perhaps come across as somewhat unusual even at present. We suggest that a possible reason for this is that solid-like properties of liquids\nhave not become apparent in the traditional approach to\nliquids from the gas state. On the other hand, we propose here that as far as their energy and heat capacity\nare concerned, liquids can be understood on the basis of\ntheir solid-like properties, consistent with Frenkel's general idea.\nWe have recently proposed how liquid energy can be\ncalculated in Frenkel's approach, by relating liquid energy to \u03c4 [15]. We have found good agreement of liquid heat capacity between theoretical and experimental\ndata for mercury. Two important questions subsequently\narise. First, how well does the theory work for a larger\nnumber of liquids? Second, the proposed theory was harmonic. On other hand, anharmonic effects are known\nto be particularly large in liquids, where the coefficients\nof thermal expansion considerably exceed those in solids\n[15]. Hence, it is important to extend the theory to the\nanharmonic case and compare it with experiments.\nIn this paper, we propose how to include the anharmonic effects in the approach to liquids from the solid\nstate. We subsequently calculate heat capacity from both\nharmonic and anharmonic theory, and compare the results with experimental data for 5 commonly discussed\nliquids. We find good agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental data with no free fitting parameters. Finally, we discuss and compare the proposed\ntheory to the previous approaches to liquids.\n\nobservation time is smaller than \u03c4 , the local structure of\na liquid does not change, and is the same as that of a\nsolid glass. In this picture, Frenkel realized that a liquid should maintain solid-like shear waves, similarly to\nthose existing in a solid, at all frequencies \u03c9 larger than\n1\n\u03c4 [2]. This prediction was later confirmed experimentally [17\u201321]. Longitudinal waves, associated with density fluctuations, are considered to be unaffected in this\npicture, apart from different dissipation laws for \u03c9 < \u03c41\nand \u03c9 > \u03c41 [2].\nBasing on the ability to support high-frequency shear\nwaves, we have calculated liquid energy as follows [15].\nIn Frenkel's picture, liquid energy is\nE = Ev + Ed\n\nwhere Ev and Ed are the energies of vibration and diffusion, respectively.\nThe vibration energy consists of the energy of one\nlongitudinal mode and two shear modes with frequency\n\u03c9 > \u03c41 . Then, Ev can be written as Ev = Kl + Pl +\nKs (\u03c9 > \u03c41 ) + Ps (\u03c9 > \u03c41 ) where K and P correspond to\nkinetic and potential terms, respectively. Here, the absence of shear modes with frequency \u03c9 < \u03c41 is expressed\nas Ks (\u03c9 < \u03c41 ) = Ps (\u03c9 < \u03c41 ) = 0, implying the absence of\nrestoring forces for low-frequency vibrations. Similarly,\nEd can be written as Ed = Kd + Pd , where Kd and Pd\nare respective kinetic and potential terms, giving\nE = Kl + Pl + Ks (\u03c9 >\n\nHARMONIC THEORY\n\nWe begin our discussion with the work of Frenkel [2],\nwho provided a microscopic description of Maxwell phenomenological viscoelastic theory of liquid flow [16], by\nintroducing liquid relaxation time \u03c4 . As mentioned earlier, \u03c4 is the average time between two consecutive atomic\njumps in a liquid at one point in space. Each jump can\napproximately be viewed as a jump of an atom from its\nneighboring cage into a new equilibrium position, with\nsubsequent cage relaxation. These atomic jumps, or local relaxation events (LREs), give a liquid its ability to\nflow. \u03c4 is a fundamental flow property of a liquid, and is\ndirectly related to liquid viscosity \u03b7 as \u03b7 = G\u221e \u03c4 [2, 16],\nwhere G\u221e is the instantaneous shear modulus. On temperature decrease, \u03c4 increases by many orders of magnitude, reaching 102 \u2212 103 s at which point, by convention,\na liquid forms a solid glass because LREs stop operating\non a typical experimental time scale.\nIn Frenkel's theory, motion of an atom in a liquid consists of two types: vibrational motion around an equilibrium position as in a solid, with Debye vibration period\nof about \u03c4D = 0.1 ps and diffusional motion between two\nneighboring positions during time \u03c4 . Therefore, if the\n\n(1)\n\n1\n1\n) + Ps (\u03c9 > ) + Kd + Pd (2)\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n\nWe now approach a liquid from the solid state (glass)\nwhere diffusion is absent so that Ed = 0 and E = Ev . At\ncertain temperature, shear waves with frequency \u03c9 < \u03c41\ndisappear. The oscillatory motion at frequency smaller\nthan \u03c9 < \u03c41 is substituted by diffusional motion taking place during time \u03c4 . The latter motion can be\nthought of as a \"slipping\" motion at low frequency because the restoring force for low-frequency vibrations becomes small (see Figure 1). We note that forces experienced by diffusing atoms are of the same nature as those\nexperienced by vibrating atoms, and are defined by interatomic interactions that give rise to both Pd and Ps .\nTherefore, the relative smallness of Ps at small frequency\nimplies the smallness of Pd as compared to Ps (\u03c9 > \u03c41 )\n(as well as to Pl ). In other words, if the interaction energy of diffusing atoms, Pd , were large and comparable\nto Ps (\u03c9 > \u03c41 ), this would imply strong restoring forces\nand consequently the existence of low-frequency vibrations. Therefore, Pd can be neglected in Eq. (2). This\nis the only approximation in the theory [15]. We further\nnote that the energy of diffusion becomes unimportant at\nlow temperature [22]. Indeed, because the time that an\natom spends in the transitory diffusing state is approximately \u03c4D , the relative number of diffusing atoms, NNd ,\n\n\f3\n\n!\nN\n1 X 2\n2 2\n(p + \u03c9li qi ) dpdq (5)\nZ2 = (2\u03c0h\u0304)\nexp \u2212\n2T i=1 i\n!\nZ\n2N\n1 X\n2\n2 2\n\u00d7 exp \u2212\n(p + \u03c9si qi ) dpdq\n2T \u03c9 >\u03c9 i\n\u2212N \u2032\n\nZ\n\nsi\n\nFIG. 1: As temperature increases, the low-frequency oscillatory shear motion of the highlighted atom between the two\ndashed lines is lost, as the restoring force for low-frequency\nshear vibrations becomes weak. Instead, the atom \"slips\"\nand diffuses to another position defined by the solid arrow.\nSchematic illustration.\n\nwhere \u03c90 = \u03c41 , \u03c9li and \u03c9si are frequencies of longitudinal\nand shear waves, N is the number of atoms and N \u2032 is the\nnumber of phonon states that include longitudinal waves\nand transverse waves with frequency \u03c9 > \u03c41 . Here and\nbelow, kB = 1.\nIntegrating, we find\n\nZ2 = T\n\nN\n\nN\nY\n\nh\u0304\u03c9li\n\ni=1\n\nis equal to the jump probability, \u03c4\u03c4D , where Nd and N\nare the number of diffusing atoms and the total number\nof atoms, respectively. When \u03c4 significantly exceeds \u03c4D ,\nthe number of diffusing atoms and, therefore, diffusing\nenergy, become small and can be ignored.\nWe now note that the sum of all kinetic terms in Eq.\n(2) gives the total kinetic energy of the liquid, K. Indeed, K = 3N2 T regardless of how the motion partitions\ninto vibrational and diffusional motion. Then, Eq. (2)\nbecomes\n\nE = K + Pl + Ps (\u03c9 >\n\n1\n)\n\u03c4\n\n(3)\n\nIt is convenient to re-write Eq. (3) using the equipartiE (\u03c9> 1 )\ntion theorem that implies Pl = E2l , Ps (\u03c9 > \u03c41 ) = l 2 \u03c4\nand K = Kl + Ks = E2l + E2s , where we noted that liquid\nkinetic energy is the same as in the solid (K = 3N2 T ),\nand can therefore be written as a sum of kinetic terms\nrelated to longitudinal and shear waves. Then, E in\nE (\u03c9> 1 )\nEq. (3) becomes E = El + E2s + s 2 \u03c4 . For subsequent calculations, it is convenient to further write\nEs = Es (\u03c9 < \u03c41 ) + Es (\u03c9 > \u03c41 ), where the two terms\nrefer to their solid-state values. Then, E becomes finally\n\nE = El + Es (\u03c9 >\n\nEs (\u03c9 < 1/\u03c4 )\n1\n)+\n\u03c4\n2\n\n(4)\n\nThe first two terms can be calculated in the same way\nas is done in the harmonic theory of solids [1], except\nwe separate longitudinal and shear waves in the partition\nfunction and account for shear waves with frequency \u03c9 >\n1\n\u03c4 only. Let Z2 be associated with the first two terms in\nEq. (4). Then, Z2 is:\n\n0\n\n!\u22121\n\nT\n\n2N\nY\n\nN1\n\nh\u0304\u03c9si\n\n\u03c9si >\u03c90\n\n!\u22121\n\n(6)\n\nwhere N1 is the number of transverse modes with \u03c9 > \u03c90 .\nIn the harmonic approximation, frequencies \u03c9li and \u03c9ti\nare considered to be temperature-independent, in contrast to anharmonic case discussed in the next section.\nThen, Eq. (6) gives the liquid energy in harmonic apd\nproximation E = T 2 dT\nln Z = N T + N1 T . N1 can be\ncalculated using the quadratic density of states in the\nDebye model, as is done in solids [1]. The density of\n2\nstates of shear modes is gt (\u03c9) = \u03c96N\n3 \u03c9 , where \u03c9mt is\nmt\nDebye frequency of shear modes (\u03c9mt \u2248 \u03c9D ) and we\nhave taken into account that the number\n\u0013\n\u0012 of\u0010shear\u0011 waves\n\u03c9Rmt\n3\n0\n.\nis 2N . Then, N1 =\ngt (\u03c9)d\u03c9 = 2N 1 \u2212 \u03c9\u03c9mt\n\u03c90\n\nTo calculate the last term in Eq. (4), we note that\nsimilarly to Et (\u03c9 > 1/\u03c4 ) = N1 T , Et (\u03c9 < 1/\u03c4 ) = N2 T ,\nwhere N2 is the number of shear modes\n\u0011 with \u03c9 < \u03c90 .\n\u0010\n\nBecause N2 = 2N \u2212 N1 , N2 = 2N\n(N + N1 +\n\nN2\n2 )T ,\n\n\u03c90\n\u03c9mt\n\n3\n\n. Then, E =\n\ngiving finally\n\nE = NT\n\n3\u2212\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c90\n\u03c9D\n\n\u00133 !\n\n(7)\n\nAccording to Eq. (7), the liquid energy is 3N T as in\na solid when \u03c4 \u226b \u03c4D . This gives the heat capacity per\natom, cv = N1 dE\ndT , cv = 3, consistent with experimental\nresults [8, 9]. When \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4D at high temperature, Eq.\n(7) predicts cv = 2, as in the experimental data [8, 9].\nANHARMONIC THEORY\n\nIn the harmonic approximation, temperature dependence of frequencies in Eq. (6) is ignored. This may be\na good approximation for phonons in solids at either low\ntemperature or in systems with small thermal expansion\n\n\f4\ncoefficient \u03b1. In liquids, on the other hand, anharmonicity and associated thermal expansion are large [32], and\nneed to be taken into account. In this case, applying\nd\nln Z to Eq. (6) gives\nE = T 2 dT\nN1\nN\nX\nX\n1 d\u03c9li\n1 d\u03c9si\nE2 = N T \u2212 T\n+ N1 T \u2212 T 2\n(8)\n\u03c9\ndT\n\u03c9\ndT\ni=1 li\ni=1 si\n2\n\nwhich corresponds to the first two terms in Eq. (4).\nThe anharmonic effects lead to the decrease of frequencies with temperature, resulting in system softend\u03c9si\nli\ning [32]. We therefore need to calculate d\u03c9\ndT and dT\nin Eq. (8). These can be calculated in the Gr\u00fcneisen\napproximation,\n\u0001 by introducing the Gr\u00fcneisen parameter\ni\n\u03b3 = \u2212 V\u03c9 \u2202\u03c9\n\u2202V T , where \u03c9i are frequencies in harmonic\napproximation\n\u0001 [22]. \u03b3 features in the phonon pressure\n\u2202F\n, where F is free energy in the harmonic\nPph = \u2212 \u2202V\nT\napproximation.

Then,\n\u2202T\nv\nas is often the case in experiments, this implies B \u221d \u2212T ,\nconsistent with the experimental data [32].\nWe note that experimentally, B linearly decreases with\nT at both constant volume and constant pressure [32].\nThe decrease of B with T at constant volume is due to\nthe intrinsic anharmonicity related to the softening of interatomic potential at large vibrational amplitudes; the\ndecrease of B at constant pressure has an additional contribution from thermal expansion.\n\u03c9 2 \u221d B0 + Bph and combining it with\n\u0011\n\u0010 Assuming\n\n\u2202Bph\n\u2202T\n\nv\n\n= \u2212\u03b1(B0 + Bph ) from above gives\n\n1 d\u03c9\n\u03c9 dT\n\n= \u2212 \u03b12\n\nthe number of shear modes with \u03c9 < \u03c90 defined in the\nprevious section.

(12) explains why experimental cv of liquids exceed the Dulong-Petit value just above the melting point\n[8, 9]. In the next section, we compare the calculated and\nexperimental cv in the entire temperature range.\nCOMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTAL DATA\n\nWe now compare the predictions of Eqs. (7) and (11)\nwith the experimental cv . Simple liquids [8, 9] offer a\ngood test case for a number of reasons. First, they are\nfrequently discussed in the literature. Consequently, the\ndata of both cv and viscosity are available for simple\nliquids, partially because their melting temperatures are\nfairly low, simplifying the measurements. Second, these\nliquids become low-viscous close to the melting point, in\ncontrast to, for example, liquid B2 O3 , SiO2 and so on.\nConsequently, the decrease of cv , predicted by Eqs. (7)\nand (11) to operate around \u03c4 \u2248 \u03c4D , can be observed in\na convenient and accessible temperature range. Third,\nit is important to see that our theory works in a wide\ntemperature range. We have taken experimental cv for\nliquid Hg, In, Rb, Cs and Sn where cv has been measured\nin a wide range of temperatures, from 200 to 1200 K.\nTo the best of our knowledge, apart from liquid Hg,\nthis is the first attempt to analytically calculate cv of the\nabove liquids and compare them with experiments.\nTo calculate cv from the theory, we write \u03c4 = \u03c910 in\nterms of liquid viscosity using the Maxwell relationship\n\u03c4 = G\u03b7\u221e . Then, harmonic and anharmonic cv in Eq. (7)\nand Eq. (11) are given by the two equations below:\nd\ncv =\ndT\n\n[22]. Putting it in Eq.

The data were subsequently\n0\nextrapolated on the temperature range of experimental\ncv because the experimental cv was measured in a wider\ntemperature range than \u03b7, and used \u03b7 in Eqs. (13,14)\nto calculate cv . We note that cv in Eqs. (13,14) ded\u03b7\npends on both \u03b7 and dT\n, and is therefore sensitive to\nthe viscosity fit. We find that as long as the VFT fit has\nphysical values of parameters (e.g. positive T0 ), a reasonable agreement between the calculated and experimental\ncv is found, as discussed below in more detail.\nNotably, Eqs. (13) and (14) have no free fitting parameters. Indeed, a single parameter in Eq. (13), \u03c4D G\u221e ,\nis defined by the liquid properties. Eq. (14) has an extra\nparameter \u03b1, which is equally governed by liquid properties. In practice, however, the values of \u03c4D and G\u221e are\nnot known precisely for all liquids. Therefore, we have\nvaried \u03c4D G\u221e around its approximate experimental values\n(see below) to fit the calculated cv to the experimental\ndata.\nIn Figures (2-6), we show the experimental cv where\nthe electronic contribution was subtracted [8, 9]. We also\nshow cv , calculated from both harmonic and anharmonic\ntheory using Eqs. (13,14). Overall, Figures (2-6) show\nreasonably good agreement between the theoretical and\nexperimental cv .\nThe agreement is somewhat worse at low temperature,\nhowever the maximal difference between the predicted\nand experimental values is comparable with the experimental uncertainty of cv of 0.1\u20130.2 J/K [8].

For example, if G\u221e of Hg is about 5 GPa\n[23], the used values of \u03c4D G\u221e in Figure (2) imply \u03c4D of\nabout 0.1 ps, a typical value of Debye vibrational period\nwhich is, furthermore, consistent with the experimental\nvalue [28]. Similarly, if G\u221e of Cs is 0.77 GPa [29], the\n\nused values of \u03c4D G\u221e in Figure (4) imply \u03c4D of about\n0.1 ps, equally consistent with experiments [29]. We also\nnote that the used value of \u03c4mt G\u221e is close to that in\nother liquids [19].\nSimilarly to \u03c4D G\u221e , the values of \u03b1 used to calculate\nthe anharmonic cv (see captions to Figures (2-6)) are\nclose to experimental ones. The experimental \u03b1 for Hg,\nIn, Rb, Cs and Sn are 1.8 * 10\u22124 K\u22121 , 1.11*10\u22124 K\u22121 ,\n3*10\u22124 K\u22121 , 3*10\u22124 K\u22121 and 0.87*10\u22124 K\u22121 , respectively\n[9], in reasonably good agreement with the values used\nin Figures (2-6).\nWe observe that for all five liquids, harmonic cv is systematically below the experimental value at low temperature. This is not surprising because the maximal lowtemperature value of harmonic cv is 3, according to Eq.\n(13). As Figures (2-6) show, the anharmonic contribution, calculated using Eq. (14), is important in order to\nreproduce the experimental behavior.\nIn summary, we find that overall, theoretical and experimental values of cv agree reasonably well, using physically sensible values of parameters \u03c4D G\u221e and \u03b1.\nWe note that above we have discussed the behavior of\ncv . The quantity that is frequently measured in the experiment is the constant-pressure heat capacity, Cp . For\nseveral low-viscous liquids, Cp weakly depends on temperature, in contrast to the constant-volume heat capacity, Cv [8, 11, 30]. On the other hand, for highly viscous\nliquids, Cp increases, approximately linearly, with temperature [31]. This behavior can be rationalized in the\nproposed picture as follows. We re-write the known relationship, Cp = Cv + V T \u03b12 B [1], as cp = cv (1 + \u03b3\u03b1T ),\nC\nwhere cp = Np and \u03b3 = VC\u03b1B\nis the Gr\u00fcneisen pav\nrameter, which is on the order of unity in various systems [32]. For highly viscous liquids where \u03c4 \u226b \u03c4D ,\nthe last term in Eq. (11) representing the contribution\nfrom the\ndecreasing number of transverse waves,\n\u0012\n\u0010 \u00113 \u0013\n, can be neglected. Then, cv = 3(1 + \u03b1T ),\n3 \u2212 \u03c9\u03c9D0\n\ngiving cp = 3(1 + (\u03b3 + 1)\u03b1T ), where we have neglected\nthe square of the small parameter \u03b1T . This is consistent\nwith the linear increase of experimental cp [31]. On the\nother hand, in low-viscous liquids where \u03c4 approaches\n\u03c4D at high temperature, the contribution of the decreasing number of transverse modes in Eq. (11) can not be\nneglected. In this case, cp = cv (1 + \u03b3\u03b1T ) is the product of temperature-decreasing cv due to the decreasing\ncontribution of transverse waves (see Figures (2-6)) and\ntemperature-increasing term, \u221d \u03b1T . As a result, cp is\nless sensitive to temperature, as is seen experimentally.\n\nTWO APPROACHES TO LIQUID ENERGY:\nDISCUSSION\n\nIt is interesting to compare the proposed approach of\ncalculating liquid energy to previous theories. A tradi-\n\n\f7\ntional way to calculate liquid energy was based on the\ncalculation of liquid potential energy in addition to gas\nkinetic energy [1\u20136]. In this sense, the approach is from\nthe gas state, in that a liquid is considered to be a gas\nwith interactions switched on. In the approach from the\ngas state, liquid energy can be written in a generalized\nform as [1\u20136]:\n\nE=\n\n3\nNT +\n2\n\nZ\n\nU F dV\n\n(15)\n\nwhere U is the interaction energy between atoms and F\nis the appropriately normalized correlation function.\nIn the proposed approach from the solid state, liquid\nenergy is calculated on the basis of solid-like phonons,\nwhich therefore accounts for strong interactions from the\noutset. For convenience and reference to the foregoing\ndiscussion, we re-write the harmonic energy, Eq. (7), as\na function of \u03c4 :\n\u0012\nE = NT 3 \u2212\n\n1\n(\u03c4 \u03c9D )3\n\n\u0013\n\n(16)\n\nEarly approaches based on Eq. (15) were most successfully used for dilute or weakly-interacting systems [1\u20133].\nFor example, Van Der Waals equation serves to illustrate\nthe effects of interactions and excluded volume. At the\nsame time, cv of the Van Der Waals liquid is 23 , the same\nas that of the ideal gas [1], stressing that this system is\nfar from a real dense liquid.\nHistorically, the same general approach from the gas\nstate was also used to discuss real dense and stronglyinteracting liquids [1\u20136, 13, 14, 33]. We now propose\nthat the approach to liquids from the solid state offers a\nnumber of important advantages.\nFirst, experimental liquid cv changes from 3 right after the melting point to about 2 at high temperature (see\nFigures (2-6)). In the approach from the gas state, the\nsecond term in Eq. (15) should be as large as the first\none ( 23 N T ) in order to reproduce the low-temperature\nexperimental behavior. On the other hand, the starting\nvalue of cv = 3 in Eq. (16) is already equal to the experimental one, suggesting that this equation offers a better\nstarting point to discuss liquid cv .\nSecond, the approach from the gas state does not readily explain the experimental decrease of cv from 3 to 2.\nThe increase of temperature usually results in broadening\nof correlation functions, but without the specific form of\nF at each temperature as well as U and explicit integration, it is not easy to see how Eq. (15) explains the experimental behavior. On the other hand, Eq. (16) explains\nthe experimental data of cv in a simple and straightforward way.\nThird, both harmonic and anharmonic effects in the\napproach from the gas state are contained in U and F ,\n\nand their separation is not straightforward in general. On\nthe other hand, the anharmonic effects are readily calculated in the approach from the solid state in addition to\nharmonic terms, from the change of phonon frequencies\nand thermal expansion (see Eq. (11)). Consequently, the\nexperimental increase of cv above the Dulong-Petit value\nat low temperature is attributed to anharmonicity.\nFourth, it is important to stress that F and U are not\ngenerally available for liquids, apart from simple systems\nsuch as hard spheres, Lennard-Jones liquids that model\nAr, Kr and so on. For these systems, F and U can be\ndetermined from experiments or simulations and subsequently used in Eq. (15) to calculate the liquid energy.\nUnfortunately, neither F nor U are available for liquids\nwith any larger degree of complexity of structure or interactions. For example, many-body correlations [13, 14]\nand network effects can be strong in familiar liquid systems such as olive oil, SiO2 , Se, glycerol or even water\n[34], resulting in complicated structural correlation functions that can not be reduced to simple two- or even\nthree-body correlations that are often used in Eq. (15).\nAs discussed in Ref. [5], approximations become difficult to control when the order of correlation functions\nalready exceeds three-body correlations. Similarly, it is\nchallenging to extract multiple correlation functions from\nthe experiment. The same problems exist for interatomic\ninteractions which can be equally multi-body and complex, and consequently not amenable to determination in\nexperiments or simulations.\nOn the other hand, \u03c4 is available much more widely,\nand is readily measured in experiments of various types,\nincluding dielectric relaxation, NMR and so on. Equally,\nviscosity \u03b7 = G\u221e \u03c4 is routinely measured in liquids using\nwell-known methods, no matter how complicated structural correlations functions or interatomic interactions in\na liquid are. Therefore, Eq. (16) can be more readily used\nto calculate liquid energy from the practical perspective.\nIn future work, we plan to calculate heat capacities of\ncomplex liquids in the proposed approach.\nImportantly, Eqs. (15) and (16) are related, in that \u03c4\nthat enters Eq. (16) is itself governed by F and U in Eq.\n(15): \u03c4 = \u03c4 (F, U ). However, this function is generally\nvery complex because it is defined by the activation barriers set by F and U and not by their equilibrium properties. Calculating \u03c4 for a given set of F and U can not be\ndone analytically using a general procedure because the\npotential energy landscape gets complex even for a small\nnumber of particles and possible configurations. This\ntask can be done in a simulation but is equally challenging for realistic systems because F and U are not known\nexcept for a small set of simple systems. At the same\ntime, going to the deeper level and calculating the energy from first-principles using F and U is not required\nin our approach because it is \u03c4 that defines the liquid\nphonon states from the physical point of view, as proposed by Frenkel originally [2]. Consequently, F and U\n\n\f8\ndo not feature in the approach from the solid state (see\nEq. (16)), just as they do not in the energy of a solid.\nFifth and finally, the proposed approach from the solid\nstate can be said to be more general, or universal, as compared to the approach from the gas state, in the following sense. In the approach from the gas state, the energy\nstrongly depends on U as well as on F (see Eq. (15). It is\nfor this reason that Landau and Lifshitz state the liquid\nenergy strongly depends on the specific form of U and\ntherefore can not be calculated in general form [1]. Lets\nnow consider liquids with very different structural correlations and interatomic interactions such as, for example,\nH2 O, Hg, AsS, olive oil and glycerol. Even if their energy\ncould be calculated on the basis of Eq. (15), large differences in U and F would imply different values of energy,\nin agreement with the argument of Landau and Lifshitz\n[1]. On the other hand, as long as \u03c4 of the above liquids\nis the same at certain temperature (different for each liquid), Eq. (16) predicts that their energy is the same. In\nthis sense, expressing the liquid energy as a function of \u03c4\nonly is a more general description because \u03c4 is common\nto all liquids whereas F and U are system-specific as in\nthe above examples.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn summary, we have developed the approach to liquids from the solid state by incorporating the effects of\nanharmonicity and thermal expansion. In this approach,\nwe have found a good agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental data for five commonly discussed liquids. We have proposed that the approach to\nliquids from the solid state offers a number of advantages\nas compared to the previous approach from the gas state.\nWe are grateful to V. V. Brazhkin for discussions and\nto SEPnet, EPSRC, Myerscough Bequest and the School\nof Physics in Queen Mary University for support.\n\n[1] L. D. Landau and E. M.
