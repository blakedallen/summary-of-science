Tytgat\n\nA light scalar WIMP through the Higgs portal?\n\nThere is much interest recently in light dark matter (DM) candidates, by which I mean here\nWIMPs1 with a mass in the GeV range. As everybody at this conference knows, this is mostly\ndue to the recent (and less recent) hints provided by some direct detection experiments. In particular, last March the CoGeNT collaboration released an analysis of their first round of data taking,\nwhich revealed an excess of events at low recoil energies [2]. If interpreted as being due to SpinIndependent (SI) elastic scattering of a DM particle, the excess points to a candidate with a mass\nin the GeV range, and a SI cross-section \u03c3n0 \u223c 10\u221240 cm2 . Intriguingly, this range of parameters is\nnot very different (but not altogether consistent) with that required to explain the annual modulation observed by the DAMA/LIBRA and DAMA/NaI (DAMA for brief) experiments [3].2 There\nalso been very tentative hints from the CRESST experiment (unpublished, but discussed by W.\nSeidel at this conference [5]), and there also the few events observed by CDMS-II [6], which are\nboth consistent with a light DM candidate. In the sequel, I will refer collectively to these results\nas CoGeNT-DAMA. Of course, there are also strong direct constraints on such a light candidate,\nmost notably from the CDMS-Si [7], and the Xenon10 [8, 9] and Xenon 100 [10] collaborations.\nWhether the signals and exclusion limits may be consistent with each others is still being debated\n[11], but I believe it is fair to say that \u00e7a sent le roussi for CoGeNT-DAMA, specially in the light\nof two new results. The first is the analysis of liquid Xe experimental data proposed by P. Sorensen\nat this conference, which is less sensitive to experimental uncertainties, like scintillation efficiency,\nand quite efficiently at constraining light DM candidates [12]. The other is the recent re-analysis of\nCDMS data, with a focus on low recoil energies [13]. Both studies exclude the CoGeNT-DAMA\ncandidates. However mourning the CoGeNT-DAMA results is perhaps premature and, besides, I\nbelieve that it will remain of interest in the future to study the possibility of a light DM, both from\nthe theoretical and experimental point of views.\nThere are in the literature two complementary approaches to the study of potential light WIMP\ncandidates, with both pros and cons. The model-independent approach, which is based on effective operators, each of which may encompass many models, depends by construction on very few\nparameters but has generally limited predictive power (see e.g. [14, 15, 16, 17]). The model\ndependent approach is generally limited in scope, but has potentially a richer phenomenology\n(see e.g. [18, 19, 20]). Here I briefly review the status of the simplest real singlet scalar model\n[21, 22, 23, 24]. The salient features of this toy model are the following. The stability of the scalar,\nS, is ensured by a Z2 symmetry, introduced by hand, and not broken in the vacuum. The S interacts with the Standard Model particles only through the Standard Model Higgs (hence the Higgs\nportal). This implies that elastic scattering with nuclei (like in direct detection) and annihilation\n(like in the early universe) are related [25]. To put differently, there is just one family of relevant\neffective operators at low energies in this model,\nOS \u223c\n\n\u03bbS m f 2  \u0304\nS f f,\nMh2\n\n1 By\n\nWIMP I mean here a neutral, stable particle with a relic abundance fixed by thermal freeze-out, i.e. h\u03c3 vi \u223c\ncm3 *s\u22121 . This does not imply that the candidate has electroweak interactions, or has a mass related to the\nelectroweak scale, and thus potentially includes many scenarios, including WIMPless particles [1].\n2 A major problem with such an interpretation is that the unmodulated rate must be also large, which implies that\nthe background must be anomalously low in the region of recoil energies where the signal is observed by DAMA, see\nfor instance [4].\n\n10\u221226\n\n2\n\n\fMichel H.G. Tytgat\n\nA light scalar WIMP through the Higgs portal?\n\nwhere \u03bbS is the S-Higgs quartic coupling, and Mh is the Standard Model Higgs mass (and thus only\nthe combination \u03bbS /Mh2 is relevant) and m f is a fermion mass. The mass of the scalar DM is given\nby\nMS2 = \u03bcS2 + \u03bbS v2\nwith v = 246 GeV, and \u03bcS is the S bare mass. I remark that this expression implies that a light MS\nis not natural in this scheme, as it requires a cancellation between the two terms on the RHS (i.e.\nfine-tuning). The important outcome of these basic properties is that the cosmic relic abundance is\ndetermined if agreement with CoGeNT-DAMA is imposed. It is unique properties of such a scalar\ncandidate, interacting through a scalar particle (i.e. the Higgs), that its annihilation cross-section\nis then predicted to be h\u03c3 vi = O(3 * 10\u221226 cm3 * s\u22121 ) (see Figure I, and also, for instance [15], for\nother SM candidates and interaction channels).\nThe model has little freedom left and may be rather easely falsified. In the sequel we will\nconsider constraints from indirect detection but before this we briefly mention one striking consequence of the model for the search of the Higgs at the LHC. Agreement with CoGeNT-DAMA\nrequires the S to be rather light, and to have a substantial coupling to the Standard Model Higgs,\n\u03bbS = O(0.1). These imply that the branching ratio for the Higgs to decay into an S \u2212 S pair is close\nto one, at least for a Higgs below the threshold for massive gauge boson production [25].\nWithin the present framework, the annihilation of the S into various messengers (gammarays, positrons, anti-protons, neutrinos) is uniquely predicted and, modulo the usual astrophysical\nuncertainties, may be used to constrain further the model and its siblings. Here we consider two\nspecific signatures: the annihilation into gamma-rays in Milky Way dSphs, and the isotropic diffuse\ngamma-ray emission, both in the light of recent Fermi-LAT data.\nDue to their large mass-to-light ratio, and their limited astrophysical gamma-ray activity,\ndSphs are potentially good places to search for gamma-ray signatures of DM, despite the expected\nsmall statistic. The Fermi-LAT collaboration has studied 14 nearby dSphs within the Milky Way.\nThe first 11 months data revealed no gamma-ray excess and thus exclusion limits have been set\non the flux of gamma-rays above 100 MeV from these dSphs, for candidate heavier than 10 GeV\n[26]. Assuming a NFW profile (properly adapted to suit dSphs), the collaboration has also set\nlimits on the annihilation cross-section of specific dark matter models, most notably the neutralino\nand Kaluza-Klein DM, with mass MDM above 30 GeV, and candidates annihilating into \u03bc + \u2212 \u03bc \u2212\n(relevant for the PAMELA excess) above 10 GeV. In [24] we have used these data to set limits on\nthe flux from S candidates. Here we give in Table 1 the limits on the total annihilation cross section.\nStrictly speaking, the limit may only be set for a candidate with MS \u2265 10 GeV, so the limit on the\n6 GeV and 8 GeV candidates are based on a naive extrapolation. At this conference, Llena Garde,\nfrom the Fermi-LAT collaboration, has reported preliminary results from a stacking analysis of 8\ndSphs (for 22 months of data) which gives strong constraints and this down to MDM = 5 GeV, potentially excluding candidates below 30-40 GeV, for annihilation into b\u0304 \u2212 b [27]. The constraints\nfor annihilation into \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 may be expected to be similar. As an instance we give limits for an 8\nGeV candidate annihilating into \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , as advocated in the recent discussions around gamma-ray\nemission excess at the galactic centre [28]. More statistics would give more stringent constraints\nbut it is as likely that a cored DM profile in dSphs (instead of a cuspy NFW) would relax the\ntension, if any.\n3\n\n\fMichel H.G.

The last line is relevant for the 8 GeV candidate of Ref.[28]\n\nThe last topic that I would like to address is complementary constraints on light WIMPs (and\nthe S in particular) from the isotropic diffuse gamma-ray emission. This is again based on FermiLAT data, released in [29], which constrains candidates above 10 GeV (see also [30]). We have\ndone our own analysis, using distinct astrophysical assumptions regarding the distribution of dark\nmatter halos as a function of redshift [31]. Our results are consistent with those of [29, 30], but our\nconstraints extend to slightly lighter candidates, potentially excluding candidates which have not\nyet been probed by direct detection experiments (see Figure 2). The exclusion limits are of course\nquite sensitive to the astrophysical uncertainties (we have adopted a NFW profile for early DM\nhalos). Most critical is the mass of the lightest halo that may be formed, a parameter that depends\non the temperature of kinetic decoupling of the DM candidate (see e.g. [32]). For the case of the S,\nwhich interacts with Yukawa couplings to the Standard Model particles, the couplings to e+ e\u2212 and\nneutrinos is completely negligible, and kinetic decoupling occurs close to the chemical freeze-out,\nT \u223c 150 MeV (for the sake of comparison, typical neutralino candidates decouple close to T \u223c 1\nMeV). This in turn implies that quite light (and thus dense) dark matter halos may form in the early\nuniverse, so that the constraints are comparatively stronger (see [31] for a detailed discussion).\nHere we have briefly reviewed the constraints on a light singlet scalar dark matter candidate.\nThere is currently a fascinating interplay between direct detection experiments and indirect detection which are simultaneously becoming sensitive to WIMP candidates with a mass in the GeV\nrange. This is of course particularly relevant in the light of the recent hints for the existence of\na light DM. Further relevant constraints may come from colliders [34, 35], as well as indirect\nsearches, in particular antiprotons [36, 37, 38] and synchroton radiation [36, 39, 40]. Specifically,\ncurrent radio observations severely constrain the annihilation of GeV candidates at the centre of\nthe Galaxy [36, 39].\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis talk is a summary of results obtained in works done in collaboration with S.
