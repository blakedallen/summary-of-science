Introduction\nOne of the more controversial aspects in the study of the\nSolar System as well as studies of selected extrasolar planetary systems is the application of the Titius\u2013Bode rule (TBR).\nHistorically, the TBR was first derived and applied to the Solar\nSystem where it played a significant role in the search for new\nplanetary objects (e.g., Nieto 1972). The discovery of Uranus\nby Herschel in 1781 and the largest object of the Mars\u2013Jupiter\nasteroid belt, Ceres, by Piazzi in 1801 appeared to confirm the\napplicability and significance of the TBR. The TBR historically\ngiven by the formula\nrn = 0.4 + 0.3 \u00d7 2n,\n\nn = \u2212\u221e, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\n\n(1)\n\n(in AU) is, however, entirely inapplicable to Neptune and to the\nformer Solar System planet Pluto1 , which is still often considered to be an appropriate representative of the steadily increasing number of Kuiper Belt Objects (e.g., Jewitt & Luu 2001).\nA considerable amount of previous discussion revolves\naround the interpretation of the TBR for the Solar System,\nincluding its well-known insufficiency, see, e.g., Graner &\nDubrulle (1994), Hayes & Tremaine (1998), Lynch (2003),\nand Neslu\u0161an (2004) for previous studies largely based on sta1\n\nPluto is mentioned merely for historical reasons; it is often considered to\nhighlight the limitations of the TBR for the Solar System. Pluto is in the\n3:2 mean-motion resonance with Neptune and is thus not a dynamically\nindependent object. Moreover, long-term integrations have uncovered that\nits orbit is chaotic yet stable over billion-year timescales (Malhotra 1993).\n\ntistical analyses. For example, Lynch (2003) argued that it\nis not possible to conclude unequivocally that laws (or rules)\nof Titius\u2013Bode type are, or are not, significant, a conclusion\nthat also appears to be consistent with the work by Hayes &\nTremaine (1998). Moreover, the main conclusion of Lynch\n(2003) is also shared by Neslu\u0161an (2004). Neslu\u0161an (2004) also\npointed out the curiosity that if the Earth's distance is excluded\nfrom the sequence, then the probability of the occurrence of\nthat sequence by chance is radically reduced from 95 to 100%\ndown to 3%.\nIf no appropriate physical explanation for the TBR is identified, it is typically argued that the TBR may be merely a rule of\nchance (\"numerology\"), fuelled by the psychological tendency\nto identify patterns where none exist (Newman et al. 1994). On\nthe other hand, there are previous detailed astrophysical and astrodynamical studies that potentially point to a physical background of the TBR, at least for the Solar System and (by implication) for a selected number of extrasolar planetary systems as\nwell. For example, White (1972) argued that jet streams may\ndevelop in a rotating gaseous disk at discrete orbital distances\ngiven by a geometric progression. This result appears to be\nbroadly consistent with the work by Schmitz (1984), who pursued an analytic analysis of the structure, stability, and form of\nmarginally stable axisymmetric perturbations of idealized rotating gas clouds. His study showed that the radial parts of the\nexpansion solutions obtained from the governing differential\nyield simple oscillating functions with TBR-type features.\nA similar approach was undertaken by Graner & Dubrulle\n\n\f2\n\nAstronomical Society of Japan\n\n[Vol. ,\n\nTable 1.

(2008) and references therein, except for 55 Cnc e, for which the data from Dawson &\nFabrycky (2010) and Winn et al. (2011) were used.\n(1994), who argued that a Titius\u2013Bode type law emerges automatically as a consequence of the scale invariance and rotational symmetry of the protoplanetary disc, and that such geometrical relationships are a generic characteristic of a broad\nrange of physical systems. Li et al. (1995) investigated the\nnonlinear development and evolution of density disturbances\nin nebular disks on the basis of one of their previous studies.\nTheir analysis showed that the perturbed density is unstable\nwith respect to self-modulation, leading to the formation of\ndensity field localization and collapse. In the case of a selfsimilar collapse, the perturbed density was found to increase\nwith time and to form steady rings with very large but limited\namplitudes. The distances of these rings were found to follow a\ngeometric progression akin to the TBR. Also, in his summary\nabout the final stages of planetesimal accumulation, Lissauer\n(1993) pointed out that \"[t]he self-limiting nature of runaway\ngrowth strongly implies that protoplanets form at regular intervals in semimajor axis.\" This result appears to entail geometrical spacing of planets in planetary systems, potentially modified by their long-term orbital dynamical evolution, in possible\nagreement with (a modified version of) the TBR.\nAnother approach invoking statistical numerical experiments was adopted by Hayes & Tremaine (1998). They chose\nto fit randomly selected artificial planetary systems to Titius\u2013\nBode type laws considering a distance rule inspired by the Hill\nstability of adjacent planets. They did not identify a height-\n\nened significance of the TBR, except that its meaning is that\nstable planetary systems tend to be spaced in a regular manner. However, they indicate that their method could be used\nto identify potentially unstable planetary systems, especially if\napplied in conjunction with long-term orbit integrations. A further contribution to the interpretation of the TBR was made by\nNottale (1996) and Nottale et al. (1997) based on an approach\nof scale relativity and quantization of the Solar System. It attempts to describe the Solar System in terms of fractal trajectories governed by a Schr\u00f6dinger-like equation. The physical\nbackground and justification of this approach, however, remain\nhighly uncertain. A controversial but testable aspect of this theory is that it proposes the existence of one or two small planets\nbetween the Sun and Mercury, which to date have no support\nthrough observations. On the other hand, these studies point to\nthe general possibility of \"empty\" orbits, which may also be of\ninterest to generalized applications of the TBR as well.\nIn the following, we will apply a generalized version of the\nTBR, without subscribing to a specific physical interpretation,\nto the planetary system of 55 Cancri (= \u03c11 Cnc = HD 75732 =\nHIP 43587 = HR 3522; G8 V) (see Table 1), which was historically the fourth star other than the Sun after 51 Peg, 70 Vir,\nand 47 UMa (not counting the pulsar PSR 1257+12 as well as\nother controversial cases) that was identified hosting a planet.\nA previous effort to apply the TBR to 55 Cnc has been pursued by Poveda & Lara (2008), which will also be discussed in\n\n\fNo. ]\n\nUsage of pasj00.cls\n\nthe following. Additionally, we will compare our results to a\nmodified version of the TBR given by Lynch (2003) previously\napplied to the Solar System.\n55 Cnc is known to host five planets, named 55 Cnc b\nto 55 Cnc f, which were discovered between 1996 and 2007\nby Butler et al. (1997), Marcy et al. (2002), McArthur et al.\n(2004), and Fischer et al. (2008); note that all planets have been\ndetected using the radial velocity method. The positions of the\nplanets, according to their original determinations, are given as\n0.038, 0.115, 0.240, 0.781, and 5.77 AU, respectively, and their\nmasses (Mp sin i) range from 0.034 to 3.835 MJ (see Table 2;\nit also gives information on the respective uncertainties).\nHowever, a notable controversy emerged about the innermost planet 55 Cnc e. Dawson & Fabrycky (2010) argued\nthat the position of 55 Cnc e is given as 0.016 rather than\n0.038 AU based on an improved method that allowed to distinguish an alias from the true planetary frequency in a more\nreliable manner. This revised distance was subsequently confirmed by Winn et al. (2011) based on continuous photometric\nmonitoring with the MOST (Microvariability & Oscillations of\nSTars) space telescope. Moreover, there is an ongoing discussion about the principal possibility of additional planets in the\n55 Cnc system, particularly in the gap between 0.8 and 5 AU.\nThis speculation is fuelled by detailed orbital stability studies,\nincluding studies involving putative Earth-mass planets (von\nBloh et al. 2003; Rivera & Haghighipour 2007; Raymond et al.\n2008; Smith & Lissauer 2009; Ji et al. 2009). If such a planet\nexists, it would also possibly imply the presence of a potentially habitable planet if appropriate conditions are met (e.g.,\nLammer et al. 2009).\nThe star 55 Cnc is a middle-aged main-sequence star with a\nmass of approximately 0.95 M\u2299 (Valenti & Fischer 2005), with\na stellar effective temperature of about 5250 K (see Table 3).\nFrom the Hipparcos parallax of 79.8 \u00b1 0.84 mas (ESA 1997),\na luminosity of 0.61 \u00b1 0.04 L\u2299 (see Table 1) can be deduced,\nwhich is consistent with its spectral type G8 V (Gonzalez\n1998); see also discussion by Marcy et al. (2002). The age\nof the star can be obtained from the strength of the chromospheric Ca II H+K emission, indicating an age of 4.5 \u00b1 1 Gyr\n(Donahue 1998; Henry et al. 2000); see also Baliunas et al.\n(1997) for previous work. Another element of our work is the\nassessment of 55 Cnc's circumstellar habitability, which will\nbe pursued following the approach by Kasting et al. (1993)\nand Underwood et al. (2003); additionally, it will consider the\npossible extension of the outer boundary of habitability as discussed by, e.g., Forget & Pierrehumbert (1997), Mischna et al.\n(2000), and Halevy et al. (2009).\nOur paper is structured as follows. After the introduction of\nhistorical aspects of the TBR and 55 Cnc itself, as done, we describe our methods and results. Emphasis will be placed on the\ncalculational process concerning the TBR based on four different measures of difference; they are applied to assess the deviations between the positions of the five known planets of 55 Cnc\n(i.e., 55 Cnc b to 55 Cnc f) and the predictions of the TBR, thus\nallowing to constrain the unknown TBR parameters. In addition, we comment on the possibility of a habitable planet in\nthe 55 Cnc system as implied by the TBR. Thereafter, we consider other relevant studies, particularly studies regarding constraints from orbital stability simulations and planet formation.\n\n3\nTable 3.

(2004)\nFischer & Valenti (2005)\n\nWe also comment on a previous application of the TBR to the\n55 Cnc system given by Poveda & Lara (2008). Moreover, we\nprovide an analysis of the statistical significance for the TBR\nforwarded by this work, as well as of the previous TBR version by Poveda & Lara (2008), following the method of Lynch\n(2003). Finally, we present our summary and conclusions.\n2. Methods and Results\n2.1. Computation of the TBR Parameters\nThe centerpiece of our study is the application of the TBR to\nthe planetary system of 55 Cnc. Akin to the application of the\nTBR to the Solar System, we originally selected as approach\nn\nA\nif i = 1\naTB\n=\n(2)\ni\nA + B * Z i\u22122\nif i > 1\nguided by the original planetary data of Fischer et al. (2008).\nHere A, B, and Z constitute free parameters, which need to be\ndetermined based on the known positions of the previously discovered five planets. Based on the five known planets 55 Cnc e,\n55 Cnc b, 55 Cnc c, 55 Cnc f, and 55 Cnc d, are identified as\ni = 1, 3, 4, 6, and 9, respectively.\nThis version of the TBR is consistent with its original version customarily applied to the Solar System. Note that B indicates the compactness of the system (i.e., the higher B, the\nless dense the overall planetary distribution), whereas Z indicates the progression of the relative spacing of the planets. For\nthe Solar System, the free parameters of the above given equation take the following values: A = 0.4, B = 0.3, and Z = 2.0.\nHowever, in the meantime, a controversy emerged regarding\nthe location of the innermost planet 55 Cnc e, which based on\na re-analysis of existing data was identified to be positioned\nat 0.016 AU rather than 0.038 AU. We therefore revised the\nproposed version of the TBR such that the position of the innermost planet is changed to aTB\n= A/Z. Fortunately, test\n1\nsimulations have shown that the key predictions of this work,\ni.e., the location of the hypothetical planets at 0.081, 0.41, 1.51\nand 2.95 AU as well as the possible exterior planet, expected to\nbe located between 10.9 and 12.2 AU (if existing), are entirely\nunchanged by this alteration. Moreover, the innermost planet\nis also not part of the polynomial fit determined by Z, just like\nin case of the Solar System.\nThe pivotal aspect of our study is to determine and optimize\nthe parameters A, B, and Z based on the positions of the five\nknown planets of the 55 Cnc system, which are identified as\ni = 1, 3, 4, 6, and 9. The positions of these five planets are\ncalculated using adequate trial values for A, B, and Z. These\n\n\f4\n\nAstronomical Society of Japan\n\n[Vol. ,\n\nTable 4.

Distance variations \u03b4r for 55 Cnc f, 55 Cnc d, and the hypothetical planet 3 for a series of 25 statistical simulations. For 55 Cnc f and\n55 Cnc d, these variations are due to the observational uncertainties,\nwhich are 0.007 and 0.11 AU, respectively. For HPL 3, the distance\nvariations were computed following the TBR based on MDIF 1 (see\nTable 2).\n\nand 1.991 \u00b1 0.004 (MDIF 4). Furthermore, the distance uncertainties for 55 Cnc b to f, given by the observations, have also\na relatively small effect on the values of A, B, and Z; note that\nthe associated uncertainty is 0.3% or less in case of Z.\n2.2. Applications and Tests\nThe derivation of the TBR parameters A, B, and Z can be\nused to identify possible additional planetary positions in the\n55 Cnc system (see Table 5), potentially occupied by planets. Specifically, four planetary positions are found, which are:\n0.081, 0.41, 1.51 and 2.95 AU. As expected from our previous discussion, the influence of the different choices of MDIF\nis only of very minor importance. Figure 1 offers a detailed\ndepiction of the observed and predicted hypothetical planets.\nNote the very high quality of the fit for i > 1.\nPrior to discussing further results of our study, we want to\npresent the findings from detailed tests about the convergence\nof the TBR parameters, notably Z. Again, the TBR parameters\nA, B, and Z are obtained by trying to fit the positions of the\nknown planets 55 Cnc b to 55 Cnc f by using the TBR. This\nrequires the choice of a measure of difference, MDIF; additionally, it also requires the choice of a precision parameter for\nA, B, and Z that was chosen as 10\u2212k with k = 1, 2, 3, and 4.\nThe control parameter of convergence was the summed residual of the difference in the positions between the observed and\npredicted (fitted) distances of the five known 55 Cnc system\nplanets.\nOur results are given in Table 6. As expected, it is found\nthat the higher the selected precision, the more accurate are\nthe obtained values for A, B (not shown), and Z deduced by\nfitting the positions of the five observed planets. However, the\nsummed residuals are found to never approach exactly zero,\nregardless of MDIF and the precision parameter, although the\nresidual will converge toward a very small limit (i.e., between\n10\u22122 and 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 ), especially if MDIF 3 is selected. This\nresult is expected. First, the higher the intended precision for\n\n5\n\nA, B, and Z, the smaller the resulting residual. Second, the\nresidual cannot approach zero, even if an increasingly higher\nprecision for A, B, and Z is permitted, owing to the fact that\nthe TBR (if applicable) should be viewed as a \"rule\" rather than\na (physical) \"law\". There is no way that the TBR as proposed\n(or any modification thereof) will be able to precisely represent\nthe positions of the currently known five planets in the 55 Cnc\nsystem as also encountered in applications of the TBR to the\nSolar System.\nNext we focus on the case of the hypothetical planet HPL 3\n(see Table 5) positioned near 1.51 AU; see Table 7 for details. Concerning the four measures of difference, MDIF, the\nposition of HPL 3 is found to range between 1.504 \u00b1 0.025\n(MDIF 4) and 1.511 \u00b1 0.028 (MDIF 3). Note again that the\nuncertainty in the position of HPL 3 due to the choice of MDIF\nis insignificant. However, this hypothetical planet is of potentially high relevance because it may be located in 55 Cnc's habitable zone (HZ). Therefore, it will be discussed in more detail\nbelow (see Sect. 2.3).\nConsidering the potential importance of HPL 3, if existing,\nwe also investigated the distance variation \u03b4r due to the measurement uncertainties for 55 Cnc f and 55 Cnc d (see Table 1)\nas published; the uncertainty measurement is most substantial\nfor 55 Cnc d (both in absolute and relative units). The results\nare given in Fig. 2; here the implemented version of the TBR\nwas based on MDIF 1. Various positions for 55 Cnc f and\n55 Cnc d were assumed using a Monte\u2013Carlo approach (Press\net al. 1989) considering their observationally deduced distance\nmeasurements. We pursued a total of 25 simulations. In our\nseries of simulations, the absolute variation \u03b4r for HPL 3 was\nless than 0.03 AU.\nAnother application of the TBR is the computation of the\ndistance of the next possible outer planet of the 55 Cnc system,\ni.e., located beyond 55 Cnc d, which is at a distance of approximately 5.77 AU. This hypothetical planet is predicted to be located between 10.9 and 12.2 AU (see Table 8). More precisely,\nits position is predicted in the range between 11.33 \u00b1 0.43\n(MDIF 3) and 11.66 \u00b1 0.39 (MDIF 4).\n2.3. The Habitable Zone of 55 Cnc\nIn the following we discuss the possible location of a newly\npredicted planet in the HZ of 55 Cnc. The extent of 55 Cnc's\nHZ can be calculated following the formalism by Underwood\net al. (2003) based on previous work by Kasting et al. (1993).\nUnderwood et al. (2003) supplied a polynomial fit depending\non the stellar luminosity and the stellar effective temperature\nthat allows to calculate the extent of the conservative and the\ngeneralized HZ. Noting that 55 Cnc is less luminous than the\nSun, it is expected that its HZ is less extended than the solar\nHZ, for which the limits of the generalized HZ have been given\nas 0.84 and 1.67 AU, respectively (Kasting et al. 1993).\nThe luminosity of 55 Cnc has been deduced as 0.61 \u00b1 0.04\nL\u2299 based on the stellar distance and apparent magnitude; note\nthat this value is fully consistent with the standard values for\nthe stellar effective temperature and luminosity (see Table 1).\nHowever, if its stellar radius is 1.15 \u00b1 0.035 R\u2299 , obtained\nby Baines et al. (2008) based on new interferometric measurements, instead of R = 0.925 R\u2299 (Ribas et al. 2003), the revised\nstellar luminosity is thus given as 0.90 L\u2299 .

The top\nfigure shows the HZ of 55 Cnc based on R = 0.925 R\u2299 (Ribas et al.\n2003), whereas the bottom figure assumes R = 1.15 R\u2299 (Baines et al.\n2008), implying a relatively high stellar luminosity of 0.90 L\u2299 .\n\nTable 6.

Surely, larger\nlimits are attained if the higher value for the stellar luminosity\nis adopted. The underlying definition of habitability is based\non the assumption that liquid surface water is a prerequisite for\nlife, a key concept that is also the basis of ongoing and future\nsearches for extrasolar habitable planets (e.g., Catanzarite et al.\n2006; Cockell et al. 2009). The numerical evaluation of these\nlimits is based on an Earth-type planet with a CO2 /H2 O/N2\natmosphere.\nWe point out that concerning the outer edge of habitability,\neven less conservative limits have been proposed in the meantime (e.g., Forget & Pierrehumbert 1997; Mischna et al. 2000).\nThey are based on the assumption of relatively thick planetary\nCO2 atmospheres invoking strong backwarming that is further\nenhanced by the presence of CO2 crystals and clouds. These\ntypes of limits can be as large as 2.4 AU in case of the Sun;\nhowever, they depend on distinct properties of the planetary\natmosphere, and are thus subject to ongoing studies and controversies (e.g., Halevy et al. 2009). Concerning 55 Cnc, the\nrevised outer limit can be as large as 1.85 AU for the standard\nstellar parameters and up to 2.31 AU for the increased value\nof the stellar luminosity. These limits can be considered in\nthe assessment of the hypothetical planet near 1.51 AU (see\nTable 7). Note that the position of this hypothetical planet is\nnot significantly affected by the choice of MDIF. Based on the\nstandard parameters for 55 Cnc, this planet would be located in\nthe extremely extended HZ. If the increased value of the stellar\nluminosity of 0.90 L\u2299 is assumed, it would be located in the\ngeneralized HZ. A depiction of the different scenarios is given\nin Fig. 3.\nAnother important aspect regarding the circumstellar habitability of 55 Cnc concerns the planet 55 Cnc f. It is a hot\nNeptune with a mass of about 15% of Jupiter's mass; therefore,\nit is almost certainly unfit to host life. 55 Cnc f is located at or\nnear the inner edge of the 55 Cnc's HZ, especially if the standard value for the 55 Cnc's luminosity is adopted. However,\n55 Cnc f may be an appropriate object for hosting one or more\nhabitable moons. Previous studies on habitable moons of extrasolar planets have been given by, e.g., Williams et al.

Consideration of Other Studies\n3.1. Constraints from Orbital Stability Simulations and\nComments on Planetary Formation\nAny planet proposed to exist in a star\u2013planet system by the\nmeans of the TBR or otherwise needs to pass the test of orbital\nstability. Previously, detailed simulations of orbital stability for\nthe system of 55 Cnc have been given by, e.g., Raymond et al.\n(2008) taking into account the five known planets of the 55 Cnc\nsystem. Raymond et al. (2008) presented a highly detailed\nstudy with particular focus on the effects of mean motion resonances due to the planets 55 Cnc f and 55 Cnc d. They showed\nthat additional planets could exist between these two known\nplanets, including hypothetical planets located near 1.51 and\n2.95 AU. Specifically, if two additional planets are assumed to\nexist between 55 Cnc f and 55 Cnc d, the domains of stability are given as 1.3\u20131.6 and 2.2\u20133.3 AU. This is an important\nfinding regarding the hypothetical, potentially habitable planet\nHPL 3, proposed at 1.51 AU (see Table 7).\nA subsequent study of orbital stability was given by Ji et\nal. (2009). They also considered the impact of mean motion\nresonances and identified various unstable locations. However,\nthey identified a wide region of orbital stability between 1.0\nand 2.3 AU, a potential homestead of habitable terrestrial planets. These potential planets were also identified to have a relatively low orbital eccentricity. Furthermore, the orbital stability\nsimulations by Raymond et al. (2008) and Ji et al. (2009) are\nalso lending indirect support to the principal possibility of an\nexterior planet, which, if existing, should be located between\n10.9 and 12.2 AU from the star (see Table 8).\nAlthough orbital stability for the hypothetical planet near\n1.51 AU appears to be warranted, it is still important to gauge if\nsuch a planet could have formed in the first place noting that the\nexistence of close-in giant planet(s) have been viewed to have\nan adverse effect (Armitage et al. 2003). Subsequent studies\nby Raymond et al. (2005, 2006) have pointed out that the formation and habitability of terrestrial planets in the presence of\nclose-in giant planets is indeed possible.\nRaymond et al. (2006) gave detailed simulations also encompassing the system of 55 Cnc. Assuming that the giant\nplanets formed and migrated quickly, they found that terrestrial\nplanets may be able to form from a second generation of planetesimals. For 55 Cnc, objects with masses up to 0.6 M\u2295 and,\nin some cases, substantial water content are able to form; these\nobjects are found in orbit in 55 Cnc's HZ. This type of result\nis also consistent with findings from the quantitative numerical\nprogram by Wetherill (1996), who demonstrated that habitable\nterrestrial planets can form for a wide range of main-sequence\nstars, noting that the number and distance distribution of those\n\nDistance (AU)\nAlternative\n0.84\n0.93\n1.35\n1.66\n2.31\n\nplanets is relatively insensitive to stellar mass. This work has\nbeen expanded by Raymond et al. (2006) and applied to the\nspecial case of 55 Cnc. They found that the majority of the\nsimulations resulted in the formation of terrestrial planets positioned in 55 Cnc's HZ, including planets near 1.5 AU from the\nstar.\nThe existence of additional planets, including habitable\nplanets, in the gap between 55 Cnc f and 55 Cnc d, i.e., between\n0.781 and 5.77 AU, also appears to be consistent with the existence of a protoplanetary disk estimated to have a radial surface\ndensity profile such as \u03c3(r) = r\u22123/2 (Fischer et al. 2008). They\nalso discussed the overall surface density of the disk, which is\nestimated to be considerably higher than in the solar nebula.\nThe formation of terrestrial planets2 in the gap is furthermore\nindirectly implied by the relatively high content of heavy elements as indicated by the enhanced metallicity of 55 Cnc itself\ngiven as [Fe/H] = +0.31 \u00b1 0.04 (Valenti & Fischer 2005).\n3.2. Previous Application of the TBR to 55 Cnc\nA previous attempt to predict additional planets in the\n55 Cnc system based on the TBR has been given by Poveda &\nLara (2008). At that time all currently known planets 55 Cnc b\nto 55 Cnc f were already discovered. Poveda & Lara (2008)\nassumed a \"law\" of the form of\naTB\n= \u03b1 * e\u03bbi\ni\n\n(7)\n\n(in AU) with \u03b1 and \u03bb as free parameters. Taking into account\nthe planets 55 Cnc e, 55 Cnc b, 55 Cnc c, and 55 Cnc f, located\nbetween 0.038 (originally determined position for 55 Cnc e)\nand 0.781 AU, and represented by i = 1 to 4, \u03b1 and \u03bb were deduced as 0.0148 and 0.9781, respectively. This modified TBR\nis successful to also \"predict\" the outermost planet 55 Cnc d\nat 5.77 AU, counted as i = 6, which however was well-known\nwhen Poveda & Lara (2008) proposed the new law.\nMaking 55 Cnc d also part of the fit results in a small adjustment of the parameters \u03b1 and \u03bb, which then acquire the\nvalues of 0.0142 and 0.9975, respectively. The main aspect of\nthe work by Poveda & Lara (2008) is to predict a new planet\nfor i = 5 and possibly also an exterior planet for i = 7 as well.\nThe corresponding distances of these hypothetical planets are\ngiven as 2.08 and 15.3 AU; the corresponding orbital periods\nof the planets are approximately 3.1 and 62 years, respectively.\nNone of these putative planets are expected to be located in the\n2\n\nFollowing the study by Smith & Lissauer (2009), any additional planets in\nthe 55 Cnc system are expected to have a relatively small mass to warrant\nthe system's orbital stability. The low mass of any possible planet can also\nreadily explain why so far they were able to escape detection.\n\n\f8\n\nAstronomical Society of Japan\n\n55 Cnc's HZ. Moreover, the work by Poveda & Lara (2008)\nassumes the planet 55 Cnc e to be located at 0.038 AU rather\nthan 0.01583 AU as identified by Winn et al. (2011); note that\nPoveda & Lara published their work before the updated result\nbecame available. Thus, it is unclear if or how the \"law\" by\nPoveda & Lara (2008) could be altered to accommodate this\nfinding. A less-than-ideal approach could be to assign i = 0.11\n(or rounded to i = 0.1) to the innermost planet 55 Cnc e.\n4. Evaluation of Statistical Significance\nAn important aspect of this study is to evaluate the statistical\nsignificance of the TBR as deduced. In this case, we largely\nfollow the method previously applied by Lynch (2003) to both\nthe Solar System and the Uranian satellite system. In the first\nstep, the mean square deviation is calculated. For the TBR\nproposed in the present work, we find\n\u0001\u00032\n1 X\u0002\n\u03c72fit =\nlog(ai \u2212 A) \u2212 log B + (i \u2212 2) * log Z (8)\n4 i\n\n[Vol. ,\n\nof the planetary sequence. However, the newly proposed TBR\nhas the attractive feature that it is of virtually the same form\nas that of the Solar System; see Eq. (1). Here the parameter\nB describes the compactness of the system3 , which is much\nhigher than for the Solar System. Furthermore, the parameter\nZ describes the relative geometrical spacing of the system; it\nis virtually identical to that of the Solar System, i.e., Z = 2.0.\nPerhaps surprisingly, the TBR appears to be about as applicable to the 55 Cnc system as to the Solar System gauged by\nwhether or not the degree of similarity between the predicted\nand observed distance sequences can occur by chance (see\nIntroduction for data on the Solar System). Thus, the application of the TBR to 55 Cnc appears to be justified. However,\nconsiderable care is required to draw final conclusions because\nthe fitting of five known planets assuming four gaps in the sequence is much easier than fitting the continuous sequence of\nnine distances, i.e., with the mean asteroidal distance included\nand Pluto omitted; see Neslu\u0161an (2004). It will be the task of\nfuture planetary search missions to inquire if the planetary system of 55 Cnc follows (1) the TBR of this work, (2) the TBR\nby Poveda & Lara (2008), (3) another version of TBR-type sequencing, or (4) no TBR-type sequencing after all, as found for\nthe vast majority of the currently known planetary systems.\n\nwhere ai constitute the observed distances for the planets i = 3,\n4, 6, and 9. For A, B, and Z, we adopt the average values attained by the sets of runs pertaining to the four different measures of difference, MDIF (see Table 4). Furthermore, we pursued a sufficently large number N of statistical model runs, 5. Summary and Conclusions\nwhere for each model j we obtain\nThe goal of our study is to provide an application of the\n\u0001\u00032\n1 X\u0002\nlog(ai \u2212A)\u2212 log B +(i\u22122+kyi)*log Z (9) TBR to the 55 Cancri star\u2013planet system.

Thus, the analysis of 2008; Ji et al. 2009) as well as previous studies about 55 Cnc's\nstatistical significance of these two different versions of TBR proposed protoplanetary disk (Fischer et al. 2008).

Specifically, if two additional planets are assumed\nto exist between 55 Cnc f and 55 Cnc d, the domains of stability were derived as 1.3\u20131.6 and 2.2\u20133.3 AU. These two ranges\nare fully compatible with the results of the present study.\nMoreover, the possible planet near 1.51 AU is of particuar\ninterest as it appears to be located at the outskirts of the stellar HZ. The existence of this planet is consistent with both orbital stability simulations and studies of the formation of terrestrial planets for 55 Cnc. For example, calculations of terrestrial planet formation by Raymond et al. (2006) showed that the\nmajority of their simulations lead to the build-up of terrestrial\nplanets in 55 Cnc's HZ, including planets near 1.5 AU from the\nstar. Nonetheless, the final verdict of potential habitability of\nthis possible planet (if existing) depends on a sizeable number\nof factors, including the definition of the zone of circumstellar habitability, considering that the outer boundary of the stellar HZ is notably impacted by a variety of astrobiological aspects (e.g., Lammer et al. 2009) including the structure, density\nand compositions of the planetary atmosphere (e.g., Forget &\nPierrehumbert 1997; Mischna et al. 2000; Halevy et al. 2009).\nThe TBR as implemented follows closely the previous version as applied to the Solar System with A, B, and Z as free\nparameters, which were obtained through careful statistical fitting considering the five known planets of the 55 Cnc system.\nHere we obtain A \u2243 0.031, B \u2243 0.049, and Z \u2243 1.98. The\nparameter B indicates the compactness of the planetary system, which is much higher than for the Solar System as also\nindicated by the conventional version of Solar System's TBR\n(B = 0.3). The parameter Z indicates the relative geometrical spacing of the planetary system; it is virtually identical to\nthat of the Solar System (Z = 2.0). We also computed the orbital distance of a the next possible outer planet of the 55 Cnc\nsystem, i.e., exterior to 55 Cnc d. Our study predicts that if\nexisting it would be located between 10.9 and 12.2 AU from\nthe star. This distance is consistent with previous orbital stability analyses, which predict the position of a possible exterior\nplanet as beyond 10 AU (Raymond et al. 2008).\nIn summary, it is obviously up to future observational efforts to verify or falsify the existence of any possible additional\nplanets. From a general perspective, these efforts will assist\nin gauging the applicability of the TBR outside of the Solar\nSystem, and will help to discriminate between different versions of the TBR if found applicable to the 55 Cnc star\u2013planet\nsystem.\nThe author acknowledges valuable comments by an anonymous referee, which also resulted in the addition of Section 4.\nReferences\nArmitage, P.
