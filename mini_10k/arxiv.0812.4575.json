I show that the existence and properties of this mode are sensitive to the\nenergy dispersion of the interaction. Specifically, when the pairing is suppressed at the Fermi\nlevel, the Higgs mode may become unphysical (virtual) state or a resonance with finite lifetime,\ndepending on the details of interaction. Conversely, the Higgs mode is discrete for the pairing\ninteraction enhanced at the Fermi level. This work illustrates conceptual difficulties associated with\nintroducing collective variables in the many-body pairing dynamics.\n\nThe low-energy properties of many-body systems with\nspontaneously broken symmetries are encoded in the collective modes associated with the structure of the order\nparameter. The dynamics is usually dominated by the\ngapless Goldstone modes that restore the symmetry [1],\nwhich makes them easily observable in variety of systems.\nIn contrast, the massive Higgs modes [2] resulting from\nthe amplitude variations of the order parameter are hard\nto detect. Moreover, they do not necessarily exist when\nthe order parameter is generated dynamically due to collective effects. Understanding how these modes emerge\nin a microscopic framework is essential for constructing\nfield-theoretical descriptions operating with a partial set\nof dynamical variables.\nThis peculiarity of the Higgs mode becomes evident in\nthe BCS model of superconductivity [3], where pairing of\nfermions with opposite spins and momenta is described\nby a complex-valued order parameter. Several collective\nmodes distinct from the Higgs mode have been considered in superconductors: the excitonic states [4, 5], the\nhigh-temperature phase modes [6], and also a phonon gap\nmode observed in materials with coexisting superconductivity and charge-density waves [7, 8]. At the same time,\nno direct signatures of the intrinsic amplitude mode have\nbeen found so far. The main difficulty has to do with the\nstructure of quasi-particle excitations in the system.\nThe role of quasi-particle states is clarified in the response to a small pairing perturbation. The induced dynamics can be described as the dephasing of individual\nquasi-particle states excited in the vicinity of the Fermi\nenergy, with the rate of dephasing proportional to the\nexcitation energy. As a result one finds a power-law decay of the perturbation [9]. Equivalently, this behavior\ncan be linked to the square-root singularity of the density\nof states at the gap energy [9]. Recent extension of the\nanalysis to non-linear regimes [10, 11] has also demonstrated the absence of the intrinsic collective excitations\nof the pairing amplitude. One of the implications of this\nbehavior is the lack of an effective description of the pairing dynamics such as time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau\ntheory in gapped superconductors [12, 13]. However, the\nresults of the analysis rely on the key assumption of constant interaction between fermions and change qualita-\n\nEnergy\nHiggs\nResonance\n\nC\n\nBCS continuum\nB\n\nA\nDispersion\n\nNegative\n\nPositive\nVirtual state\n\nSpectral gap\n\nDiscrete\nHiggs mode\n\nFIG. 1: The Higgs mode energy sketched as a function of\ndispersion: the mode is discrete within the spectral gap for\npositive dispersion (regime A); the mode is non-physical (virtual state) for a smooth negative dispersion (regime B); and it\nbecomes a resonance inside the continuum of the BCS quasiparticles for sharp and negative dispersion (regime C).\n\ntively otherwise.\nIn this work, I discuss three different regimes of the\npairing dynamics that appear due to the energy dispersion of fermionic interaction in the BCS model. The main\nresults of this work are summarized in Fig. 1. In particular, the energy of the discrete amplitude mode lies inside\nthe spectral gap (regime A) resulting in non-decaying dynamics when the pairing is enhanced at the Fermi energy\n(positive dispersion). Upon smooth reduction of the dispersion, the energy of the mode gradually approaches the\ncontinuum of quasi-particle excitations eventually merging with the edge of the spectrum at constant interaction. In this case, and also for a smooth suppression\nof the pairing (negative dispersion) the collective mode\nbecomes non-physical (virtual state), which is reflected\nin a power-law decay of the dynamics (regime B). The\nmode becomes a resonance (damped oscillation) within\nthe quasi-particle continuum with a finite lifetime only\nwhen the energy-scale of suppression is small compared to\nthe equilibrium gap at the Fermi energy (regime C). The\n\n\f2\nlifetime of the Higgs mode is small compared to the quasiparticle relaxation time, making the dynamics analogous\nto the Landau damping [14] in collisionless plasma.\nOur system is described by the BCS Hamiltonian\nX\nX\nH=\n\u01ebp a\u2020p\u03c3 ap\u03c3 \u2212\n\u03bbpq a\u2020p\u2191 a\u2020\u2212p\u2193 aq\u2193 a\u2212q\u2191 ,\n(1)\np\u03c3\n\npq\n\nwhere a\u2020p\u03c3 is the creation operator of a spin-1/2 fermion\nwith momentum state p and spin state \u03c3 =\u2191, \u2193, \u01ebp =\np2 /(2m) \u2212 \u03bc is the energy of free fermions with respect\nto the Fermi energy \u03bc. The summation is conventionally\nperformed over the states within the band |\u01ebp | < \u03c9D of\nfinite width related to e.g. the Debye energy.\nThe energy dispersion of interaction \u03bbpq in Eq.(1)\nleads to the energy-dependence of the pairing gap. The\nanalytical treatment is simplified in the case when it\nis taken in a factorized form \u03bbpq = \u03bbfp fq , such that\nf|p|=pF = 1. Diagonalizing the BCS Hamiltonian (1),\none obtains the quasi-particle excitation spectrum Ep =\n(\u01eb2p + \u22062p )1/2 characterized by the pairing amplitude\n\u2206p = fp \u2206F ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the energy dependence is provided by fp , and \u2206F\nis the equilibrium value of the pairing gap at the Fermi\nenergy. P\nThe self-consistency condition takes on the form\n2/\u03bb0 = p fp2 /Ep and defines \u2206F as a function of fp and\nthe coupling constant \u03bb0 . The factorized form of energydependent interaction simplifies the analysis. Nonetheless, the qualitative results obtained in this work also\napply to a generic form of interaction.\nWe analyze the dynamics induced by a small perturbation of pairing interaction, \u03b4\u03bb(t) = \u03bb(t) \u2212 \u03bb0 . It is\ncharacterized by the expectation value of the pairing operator\nX\n\u02c6 = \u03bb0\n\u2206\nfp a\u2020p\u2191 a\u2020\u2212p\u2193 ,\n(3)\np\n\ncalculated with respect to time-dependent many-body\nstate. The problem is solved by employing the timedependent mean-field approach [15] valid at time scales\nsmaller than the quasi-particle relaxation time. The linear response of the pairing amplitude \u03b4\u2206p = fp \u03b4\u2206 is\ngiven by\nZ t\n\u02c6\n\u03b4\u2206(t) = \u2212i\nd\u03c4 h[\u2206(t),\nV\u0302 (\u03c4 )]i,\n(4)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere the operators evolve according to the unperturbed\nHamiltonian (1), and the average h...i is taken with respect to its ground state. The perturbation operator\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2206F \u03b4\u03bb(t) \u03b4\u2206(t) \u02c6 \u2020\nV\u0302 (t) = \u2212\n\u2206 (t) + h.c.

(4) simplifies if one assumes the\nparticle-hole symmetry. This condition implies that the\nenergy-dependent pairing gap is symmetric with respect\nto the Fermi energy. In this case, the phase and the\namplitude modes of \u2206 decouple and can be analyzed\nseparately. Concentrating on the amplitude mode \u03b4\u2206\u2032\nexcited by the perturbation (5), we obtain the solution\nof the inhomogeneous integral equation by the Fourier\ntransformation:\n\u03b4\u2206\u2032 (\u03c9) = [G(\u03c9) \u2212 1]\n\n\u2206F\n\u03b4\u03bb(\u03c9),\n\u03bb0\n\n(6)\n\nwhere G(\u03c9) is a retarded spectral function describing the\nmany-body response.

The states in (8) are\nlabeled by energy \u01eb instead of momentum p, and according to the usual rule \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c9 + i0 for the retarded function. It is worth noting that Eq. (8) is in agreement with\nRef. [9].\nThe analytic structure of G(\u03c9) in the complex \u03c9-plane\ndefines the time-dependence of the pairing amplitude\n\u03b4\u2206(t). In particular, we are interested in locating the\npoles \u03c9\u2206 = \u03c90 \u2212 i\u0393 of G(\u03c9) \u221d (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9\u2206 )\u22121 , or equivalently the simple roots of G\u22121 (\u03c9) on the real axis or in the\nlower-half plane. In the dynamics the former correspond\nto non-decaying oscillations with frequency \u03c90 , while the\nlatter are characterized by finite lifetime \u03c4 = 1/\u0393.\nLet us first consider the case when the pairing gap\n\u22062\u01eb \u2248 \u22062F \u2212 \u03b2\u01eb2\n\n(9)\n\nhas a smooth maximum at the Fermi energy, i.e. the\ncurvature is small 0 \u2264 \u03b2 \u226a 1, and the characteristic\nenergy scale \u03b3 of the maximum is large, i.e. \u03b3 \u226b \u2206F .\nAlthough in a realistic situation these two parameters can\nbe related to one another, for the sake of the argument\nwe consider \u03b3 and \u03b2 as independent parameters. In this\ncase the root of G\u22121 (\u03c9) = 0 is close to the quasi-particle\ncontinuum \u03c9\u2206 <\n\u223c 2\u2206F . By expanding Eq.

In\nthe pairing dynamics, the virtual state leads to a powerlaw decay of \u03b4\u2206(t) similar to the dispersionless case of\nRef.

In\nthe opposite limit of sharp energy dispersion \u03b2 \u226b 1, the\nenergy of the Higgs mode is close to the asymptotic value\nof the spectral gap 2\u2206\u2217 , as it follows from the expansion\nof Eq. (8):\n2\n\n\u03c9\u2206 \u2248\n\n4\u22062\u2217\n\n+4\n\nR\u221e\n\n0\nR\u221e\n0\n\n\u22062 \u2212\u22062\n\n\u01eb\n\u2217\nd\u01eb \u01eb2 +\u2206\n2 \u2212\u22062\n\u01eb\n\n\u2217\n\nd\u01eb \u01eb2 +\u220612 \u2212\u22062\n\u01eb\n\n.\n\n(14)\n\n\u2217\n\nIn this expression, the upper limits of the integrals are\nsubstituted with infinity, by using their fast convergence.\nExplicit calculation for model (13) reveals a square-root\nsingularity in the energy of the Higgs mode\np\n2\n(15)\n\u03c9\u2206\n\u2248 4\u22062\u2217 + 4\u03b3 2 \u03b2,\n\nas a function of \u03b2. This singularity is related to the form\nof interaction in Eq.(13), and is not universal.\nThe spectral weight of the Higgs mode in the dynamics\nis extracted from the residue of the pole in the spectral\nfunction\n\n(12)\n\ndefines the spectral weight of the Higgs mode in the dynamics of \u03b4\u2206(t). As expected, it vanishes in the dispersionless limit \u03b2 = 0. The pairing dynamics at \u03b2 > 0 is\ncharacterized by non-decaying oscillations of \u03b4\u2206(t) with\nfrequency (11).\nBy inspecting Eq. (11) we find that a virtual state\nis formed at smooth negative dispersion. The analytical continuation to negative \u03b2 < 0 shows that the mode\nseemingly has the same energy as for \u03b2 > 0. In fact it\nbelongs to a non-physical sheet of \u03c9 (regime B in Fig. 1)\nas it follows from careful analysis of Eq. (10). Indeed the\ndecrease of \u03b2 from positive values to zero, brings the energy of the mode to the branch point at \u03c9 = 2\u2206F . Upon\nfurther reduction of \u03b2 to negative values, the mode enters\nthe non-physical sheet of the Riemann surface parameterized by \u03c9 from the branch cut and moves away from this\n\n\u01eb2\n,\n1 + \u01eb2 /\u03b3 2\n\nG(\u03c9) \u2248\n\n2 1/4\n(2\u2206F )2\n,\n\u03b2 (\u03b3/\u2206F ) 2\n2\n\u03c0g\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9\u2206\n\n(16)\n\nvanishing in the dispersionless limit \u03b3 = 0 (see Eq. (13)).\nThe analytic structure of Eq. (15) is different from\nEq.(11): as the sign of \u03b2 changes from positive to negative, the former acquires an imaginary part with the real\npart simultaneously pushed in the quasi-particle continuum, since \u2206\u2217 > \u2206F . To verify this qualitative observation one needs to continue G(\u03c9) analytically in the\nlower-half of complex \u03c9-plane and locate the pole.\nThe analytical continuation of G(\u03c9) is achieved by isolating the singularities of the integrand in Eq. (8). We\nnotice that wherever the imaginary part of frequency I \u03c9\nchanges from positive to negative value, provided its real\npart satisfies R \u03c9 > 2\u2206F , a singularity occurs in the integrand of G\u22121 (\u03c9) at the energy \u01eb that solves the equation\nE\u01eb = R \u03c9/2. By deforming the contour of integration\n\n\f4\nover the energy to enclose the pole, as Fig. 2(a) illustrates, we find the analytical continuation.\nNext we apply this method to calculate the energy of\nthe Higgs resonance in the case of negative dispersion\nat |\u03b2| \u226b 1. The explicit calculation of G(\u03c9) for model\ninteraction (13) is straightforward but tedious. Solving\nfor the zeros of the analytic function, we define the energy\nof the Higgs resonance\np\n2\n\u03c9\u2206\n\u2248 4\u22062\u2217 \u2212 i4\u03b3 2 |\u03b2|.\n(17)\n\nAs we have anticipated, the energy of the mode coincides\nwith Eq. (15) analytically continued to negative values\nof \u03b2. The spectral function is obtained from Eq. (16) by\nsubstituting \u03b2 1/4 with |\u03b2|1/4 ei\u03c0/4 .\nThe analytical structure of G(\u03c9) for the energy dispersion (13) is shown schematically in Fig. 2. At smooth and\nnegative dispersion below a critical value, |\u03b2| \u2264 |\u03b2c (\u03b3)| <\n\u223c\n1, the Higgs mode belongs to the non-physical sheet\n(regime B). The critical point \u03b2c (\u03b3) depends weakly on\nthe energy scale \u03b3 \u226a \u2206F . In this parameter range there\nis an additional critical point |\u03b2i (\u03b3)| < |\u03b2c (\u03b3)| such that\nat |\u03b2| < |\u03b2i | the energy of the mode is real. Conversely at\n|\u03b2| > |\u03b2i | the energy develops imaginary part increasing\nuntil the mode enters the physical sheet at \u03b2 = \u03b2c where\nit becomes a resonance (regime C).\nThe change from analytic to non-analytic dependence\non \u03b2 in the Higgs mode energy (11) and (15) is accompanied by a singular behavior of the quasi-particle dephasing. Indeed, by expanding the quasi-particle energy\nat small \u01eb we find E\u01eb \u2248 \u2206F + (1 \u2212 \u03b2)\u01eb2 /(2\u2206F ). At\n\u03b2 = 1 the quadratic term in \u01eb vanishes, and the dispersion is controlled by higher-order terms in the expansion.\nThis singularity affects the quasi-particle\ndephasing in\nR\nthe pairing amplitude \u03b4\u2206qp (t) \u2243 R d\u01ebu\u01eb e\u2212i2E\u01eb t , where\nu\u01eb is a smooth function finite at the Fermi energy. Upon\nsubstitution of the expansion of E\u01eb to the phase factor, we\nobtain a 1/2 power-law decay \u03b4\u2206qp (t) \u2243 Re\u2212i2\u2206F t [(1 \u2212\n\u03b2)t]\u22121/2 valid at long times t >\n\u223c 1/\u2206F . Function \u03b4\u2206qp has\na square-root singularity with a branch cut along the positive real axis at \u03b2 \u2265 1. At smaller values the function is\nanalytic. There is no direct correspondence between this\nnon-analyticity controlled by the low-energy expansion\nand the non-analyticity of the Higgs mode (15) defined\nby the high-energy asymptotics of the interaction. The\nexplicit calculation in Eqs. (15) and (17) illustrates that\nthe character of the latter is specific to the model.\nThe dynamics of the pairing amplitude \u03b4\u2206(t) is controlled by G(\u03c9). The two contributions, from the Higgs\npole \u03c9\u2206 = \u03c90 \u2212i\u0393 located on the physical sheet, and from\nthe quasi-particle branch cut, compete with each other.\nAt relatively small times t >\n\u223c 1/\u2206F the quasi-particle\nstates provide the main contribution leading to the algebraic decay of the pairing amplitude. At intermediate\ntime scales, 1/\u2206F \u226a t \u226a 1/\u0393, the Higgs mode dominates\nthe dynamics characterized by the pairing amplitude oscillating with frequency \u03c90 and decaying exponentially\n\nwith the decrement \u03c4 = 1/\u0393 (infinite for a discrete Higgs\nmode). Eventually, at even longer times t \u226b \u03c4 the quasiparticle contribution prevails, although having by that\ntime a smaller amplitude. When the Higgs mode turns\ninto a virtual state, the power of algebraic decay is increased compared to the power 1/2 discussed above.\nThe analysis of the pairing dynamics within the BCS\nmodel (1) is restricted to time scales small compared to\nquasi-particle relaxation time \u03c4qp [16]. At weak coupling\nand at small temperatures it is exponentially suppressed,\nwhich validates our result for the p\nlifetime of the Higgs\nmode (17) provided \u03b3 2 \u226b \u2206F /(\u03c4qp |\u03b2|).\nIn conclusion, the energy dispersion of pairing interaction qualitatively changes collective dynamics of\nfermions. The suppression of the interaction at the Fermi\nlevel generically leads to formation of a virtual Higgs\nstate with energy on a non-physical sheet of Riemann\nsurface. On the other hand, the enhancement of interaction at the Fermi level makes this mode discrete with\nenergy located in the spectral gap of quasi-particle excitations. Depending on the details of interaction, the\nmode may also become a resonance with finite lifetime\nwithin the quasi-particle continuum.\nI am indebted to L. Levitov, L. Glazman, and M.
