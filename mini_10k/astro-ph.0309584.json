Results from our numerical clusters have been tested\nagainst analytical models often used in X-ray observations: \u03b2 model (isothermal and polytropic) and those based on universal dark matter profiles. We find\na universal temperature profile, in agreement with AMR gasdynamical simulations of galaxy clusters. Temperature decreases by a factor 2-3 from the center\nto virial radius. Therefore, isothermal models (e.g. \u03b2 model) give a very poor\nfit to simulated data. Moreover, gas entropy profiles deviate from a power law\nnear the center, which is also in very good agreement with independent AMR\nsimulations. Thus, if future X-ray observations confirm that gas in clusters has\nan extended isothermal core, then non-adiabatic physics would be required in\norder to explain it.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClusters of galaxies are the largest gravitationally bound structures in the\nuniverse. Therefore, they have often been considered as a canonical data set\nfor cosmological tests. During the last two decades, a great effort has been\ndevoted to investigate the mass distribution in CDM haloes by means of numerical N-body simulations. It is now firmly established that dark matter density profiles can be fitted by an universal two-parameter function, valid from\ngalactic to cluster scales. For the gas component, the situation is less clear.\nThe ICM is in the form of a hot diffuse X-ray emitting plasma, where the cooling time (except in the innermost regions) is typically longer than the age of\nthe universe. Adiabatic gasdynamical simulations have therefore been used\nto study the formation and evolution of galaxy groups and clusters in different cosmologies. The Santa Barbara Cluster Comparison Project (Frenk et al.,\n1999, SBCCP) showed a clear difference between SPH and Eulerian Adaptive\n\n\f2\nMesh Refinement (AMR) codes. While (the only one available at that time)\nBryan and Norman's AMR code predicted an isentropic gas profile at the center, all the SPH codes used in SBCCP predicted an isothermal gas distribution\nalmost to the virial radius of the Coma-like simulated cluster. As pointed out\nby several people (e.g. Lewis et al., 2000; Serna et al., 2003), the standard\nSPH method could suffer from entropy conservation problems. This is particularly accentuated in low mass resolution SPH simulations (see Borgani et al.,\n2002). A new implementation of SPH has been recently proposed (Springel\nand Hernquist, 2002) in which entropy conservation is much better fullfilled.\nIn order to asses the reliability of our numerical results, we did an extensive convergence study in terms of resolution (mass and spatial), as well as\nnumerical technique. For this last purpose, we resimulated one of our clusters\nwith 3 different numerical codes: Tree-SPH GADGET, both with the standard (Springel et al., 2001) and the entropy conserving SPH implementation\n(Springel and Hernquist, 2002), as well as the Eulerian AMR code ART (\nKravtsov et al., 2002). Radial profiles of gas and dark matter are compared\nin Figure 1. The agreement between AMR and the entropy version of GADGET is remarkable. The standard SPH GADGET still shows the same trend\nreported in Frenk et al. (1999), although our mass resolution is 64 times better\n(5123 effective particles).\n\n2.\n\nNumerical experiments\n\nWe have carried out a series of high-resolution gasdynamical simulations\nof cluster formation in a flat LCDM universe (\u03a9m = 0.3; \u03a9\u039b = 0.7; h =\n0.7; \u03c38 = 0.9; \u03a9b = 0.02 h\u22122 ). Simulations were run with the entropy\nconserving SPH version of the parallel Tree code GADGET. We have selected\n15 clusters extracted from a low-resolution (1283 ) volumen of 80h\u22121 Mpc.\nEach object has been re-simulated by means of the multiple mass technique\n(e.g. Klypin et al., 2001). We use 3 levels of mass refinement, reaching an\neffective resolution of 5123 CDM particles (\u223c 3 \u00d7 108 h\u22121 M\u2299 ). Gas has been\nadded in the highest resolved area only. The gravitational smoothing was set to\n\u01eb = 2 \u2212 5 h\u22121 kpc, depending on number of particles within the virial radius (\nPower et al., 2003). The minimum smoothing length for SPH was fixed to the\nsame value as \u01eb. The X-ray temperature of these objects ranges from 1 to 3\nkeV. For a more extended description of the numerical experiments, the reader\nis referred to Ascasibar (2003).\n\n3.\n\nResults\n\nA detailed discussion of the results from our numerical experiments can be\nfound elsewhere (Ascasibar, 2003; Ascasibar et al., 2003). Here, we will focus\non the radial structure of gas and dark matter in clusters.\n\n\fSPH Simulations of Galaxy Clusters\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. Left: Comparison of density, temperature and entropy profiles for a cluster simulated with 3 different numerical hydro codes: Standard SPH GADGET (dashed lines); Entropyconserving GADGET (solid lines) and eulerian AMR ART code (crosses). Right: Testing\nHydrostatic equilibrium (upper panel) and polytropic equation of state (lower panel) in our numerical clusters, classified according to their dynamical state.\n\nWe have considered four self-consistent analytical models, based on the hypotheses that the hot ICM gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium with the dark matter\nhalo and that it follows a polytropic equation of state. Two of our models assume NFW (Navarro et al., 1997) and MQGSL (Moore et al., 1999) formulae\nto describe the CDM density profile, whereas the other two assume a \u03b2-model\nfor the gas distribution. One is an isothermal version with \u03b2 = 2/3 (BM)\nand the other is a polytropic model with \u03b3 = 1.18 and \u03b2 = 1 (PBM). We\nhave first tested the hypothesis of hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) and polytropic\nequation of state (e.o.s) for the gas in our clusters. In Figure 1 (right) we show\nthe results of this test. H.E. is nicely fulfilled by those clusters that are in a\nrelaxed or minor merger state. The e.o.s for the gas in these clusters can be\nreasonably approximated by a constant polytropic index of \u03b3 \u223c 1.2. Then, we\ncompared the simulated radial distributions of gas and dark matter with each\nanalytical model. By fitting the numerical X-ray surface brightness, the models based on universal CDM profiles are able to estimate the ICM properties\nwithin 30 \u2212 40% errors. \u03b2-models yield similar estimates for r \u2265 0.1R200 , but\nthe shape of the inferred profiles at smaller radii are severely misleading.\nIn Figure 2 (left) we plot the spherically averaged temperature profile of our\nhalos, together with the best fit for each analytical model. As can be seen,\nthe \u03b2-model gives the poorest fit because gas in simulations is far from being\nisothermal.\nThe projected emission-weighted temperature profile is also shown in Figure 2 (right), compared with recent AMR cluster simulations (Loken et al.,\n2002) and with X-ray observations. Both sets of simulations predict the same\n\n\f4\n\nNFW\n\nNFW\n\nMQGSL\n\nMQGSL\n\nBM\n\nBM\n\nPBM\n\nPBM\n\nFigure 2.\nLeft: 3d Temperature profiles from clusters (points) and the corresponding fit\nfrom 4 analytical models (see Ascasibar et al., 2003 for more information).
