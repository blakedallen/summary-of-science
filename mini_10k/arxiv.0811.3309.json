In\nthis work, we propose an additional torque model, arising from the interlayer exchange interaction,\nwhich can enhance or suppress the domain wall velocity depending on the sign of the exchange\nconstant or the wall motion direction relative to the magnetization orientation of the fixed layer.\nPACS numbers: 75.45.+j, 75.25.-b, 85.75.-d\n\nThe dynamics of magnetic domain wall (DW) in the\nferromagnetic nanowires has been a very active research\narea1 in spintronics. The DW motion under the magnetic field seems to be well documented experimentally\nand understood theoretically in terms of the phenomenological Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. After\nthe Berger's pioneering work2 about the spin transfer\ntorque, many experimental groups3,4,5,6,7,8 observed the\nmagnetic DW motion under spin current and much theoretical efforts11,12,13,14,15 have been exerted to refine the\nspin torque theory. Though several theoretical issues are\nstill unresolved, the experimental efforts are continued in\norder to enhance the DW velocity9,10 and reduce the critical current density.5 These two factors are essential for\nthe device applications in logic16 as well as in memory.17\nRecently, a highly enhanced DW velocity under spin\ncurrent was reported10 in the spin valve ferromagnetic nanowires. The spin valve nanowire consists of\nFeNi/Cu/Co/CoO layers. The Co layer is magnetized\nalong the magnetic easy axis or the wire direction and\nits magnetization is uniform and fixed by exchange bias.\nThe magnetization in the NiFe layer is also directed into\nthe wire direction and the DW is introduced. The current\nflow in plane induces the DW motion. While the highest DW velocity reported9 till now was about 100 m/s\nin a ferromagnetic nanowire with one layer, the observed\nDW velocity in the spin valve (with trilayer)10 reached\nup to 180 m/s. The spin valve nanowires seem to be very\npromising for the future device applications.\nIn this paper we would like to propose another source\nof spin torque in the spin valve nanowires (Fig. 1) which\ncan enhance or suppress the DW velocity under spin\ncurrent. The two top (free) and bottom (fixed) layers\nare separated by the nonmagnetic spacer layer. In the\nmagnetic multilayers, it is well known that there exists\nthe interlayer exchange coupling. Ever since the first\nobservation18 of an antiferromagnetic coupling between\ntwo magnetic layers in the transition metal multilayers,\nthe interlayer exchange couplings as a function of the interlayer spacing have been observed19 to be oscillating\nbetween ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings.\nThis interlayer exchange coupling is a source of an additional torque in the spin valve nanowires. Though the\ntheory of current-induced domain wall motion (CIDWM)\nis still very controversial, we adopt the generalized LLG\n\nequation under spin current in order to illustrate the enhanced or suppressed domain wall motion based on our\nmodel.\nThe phenomenological LLG (Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert)\nequation has been very useful in understanding the dynamics of magnetic domain walls under the magnetic\nfield. This LLG equation was also used for studying the\nCIDWM by adding the spin transfer torque. In general,\nthe LLG equation for magnetization is given by\n\u2202\n\u2202\n~ + \u03b1m\nm\n~ = \u2212\u03b3 m\n~ \u00d7H\n~ \u00d7 m\n~ + ~\u03c4 .\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\n(1)\n\nHere m\n~ is the unit vector for magnetization of the free\n~ is the effective magnetic field (applied, exlayer and H\nchange, and anisotropy fields). The first term describes\n~ the second term\nthe precessional motion of m\n~ under H,\nis the Gilbert damping torque (\u03b1 is the dimensionless\ndamping constant), and ~\u03c4 is any additional torque acting\non m.\n~ Depending on the current flow direction, current\nin plane (CIP) or current perpendicular to plane (CPP),\ntwo models are proposed\n~m\n~ m,\n~\u03c4CIP = \u2212~vs * \u2207\n~ + \u03b2m\n~ \u00d7 (~vs * \u2207)\n~\n~\u03c4CP P = \u2212\u03b3aJ m\n~ \u00d7 (m\n~ \u00d7m\n~ s ) \u2212 \u03b3bJ m\n~ \u00d7m\n~ s.\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nIn the CIP geometry, the first (second) term is\n\nFM free layer\n\nu\n\nNM layer\nFM fixed layer\nFIG. 1: (color online) Schematic structure of the spin valve\nnanowire. Two FM layers are separated from each other by\nthe nonmagnetic (NM) layer. The magnetization in the bottom layer (fixed layer) is pinned along the wire direction, while\nthe magnetization in the top layer (free layer) is free to rotate.\nThe magnetic easy axis is the wire direction. After introduction of DW in the free layer, DW is set in motion by spin\ncurrent. The interlayer exchange coupling between two ferromagnetic layers can enhance or suppress the DW motion,\ndepending on the sign of the exchange coupling and DW motion direction relative to the magnetization orientation of the\nfixed layer.\n\n\f2\n(non)adiabatic torque and vs is proportional to the current density and the spin polarization. In the CPP geometry, \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio and both aJ and bJ are\nproportional to the current and the spin polarization, m\n~s\nis the magnetization unit vector in the fixed layer. The\neffect of ~\u03c4CP P on the DW motion in spin valve nanowires\nwas studied20 recently theoretically. However. in the\nexperiment10 of the spin valve, the DW motion was measured in the CIP geometry, but not in the CPP geometry.\nIn this work, we study the LLG equation under the action of ~\u03c4CIP and the interlayer exchange coupling. The\ninterlayer exchange coupling is modeled by the following\nHamiltonian21\nHlayers = \u2212J m\n~ *m\n~ s.\n\n(4)\n\nFor the positive (negative) exchange constant J, the coupling is ferromagnetic (antiferromagnetic). The sign of\nexchange coupling depends on the spacing of the nonmagnetic layer sandwiched in between two ferromagnetic\nlayers. The above interlayer coupling gives rise to an\nadditional torque on the magnetization m.\n~\n~\u03c4layer = \u2212\u03b3J m\n~ \u00d7m\n~ s.\n\n(5)\n\nThis torque is nonzero only near the domain wall and\nvanishes in the collinear sections of a nanowire. This\ntorque is very similar to the second term in ~\u03c4CP P , but\nthere is a big difference: J is nonzero even when there is\nno current perpendicular to the spin valve, while bJ = 0\nwithout any perpendicular current.\nOur goal is to study the domain wall motion under the\naction of two torques ~\u03c4CIP and ~\u03c4layer .\n~m\n~ m\n~\u03c4 = \u2212~vs * \u2207\n~ + \u03b2m\n~ \u00d7 (~vs * \u2207)\n~ \u2212 \u03b3J m\n~ \u00d7m\n~ s . (6)\n~ = \u2212\u03b4E/\u03b4 m\nThe effective magnetic field H\n~ is computed\nfrom the following magnetic energy density for magnetization\nE =\n\n1 2\nJa (\u2202z m)\n~ 2 \u2212 Am2z + Km2y .\n2\n\n(7)\n\nHere J is the exchange coupling, A and K are the\nanisotropy constants, and a is the lattice spacing. Representing the magnetization m\n~ in terms of two Euler angles\n\u03b8 and \u03c6 and minimizing the magnetic energy, a transverse\nwall is obtained.\n\u03c6(z, t) = \u03a6(t),\n\n(8)\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nz \u2212 q(t)\n\u22121\n.\n\u03b8(z, t) = 2 cot exp \u2212\n\u2206\n\n(9)\n\nHere q is the DW position and \u2206 defines the domain wall\nwidth.\n\u22062 =\n\nJa2\n.\n2(A + K sin2 \u03a6)\n\n(10)\n\nIn order to see the effect of the interlayer exchange interaction, we consider the above rigid transverse domain\n\nwall. Though the azimuthal angle depends on time, the\ntime dependence of the domain wall width can be neglected in the leading approximation. Finally the LLG\nequation in components is\nq\u0307\nvs\n\u2212 \u03b1\u03a6\u0307 =\n+ \u03b3K sin 2\u03a6,\n\u2206\n\u2206\n\u03b2vs\nq\u0307\n+ \u03b3J.\n\u03b1 + \u03a6\u0307 =\n\u2206\n\u2206\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\nIn the steady mode, \u03a6\u0307 = 0 so that the domain wall velocity u = q\u0307 is given by\nu =\n\n\u03b2\n\u03b3J\u2206\nvs +\n.\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\n(13)\n\nThe first term in u comes from the spin transfer torque\nfrom spin current, while the second term from the interlayer exchange coupling.\nIn the spin valve structure of a ferromagnetic nanowire,\nthe domain wall motion is affected by the fixed layer via\nthe interlayer exchange interaction. the DW velocity can\nbe either enhanced or suppressed depending on the relative direction of DW motion and the magnetization orientation of the fixed layer or the sign of the interlayer exchange constant. For the ferromagnetic coupling,22 the\nDW velocity is enhanced (suppressed) when its motion is\ndirected along (against) the magnetization orientation of\nthe fixed layer. For the antiferromagnetic coupling, the\nDW velocity behaves in an opposite way compared to the\nferromagnetic coupling case.\nOur result shows that the domain wall keeps moving\neven in the absence of driving current. This is obvious\nbecause two magnetizations tend to be (anti)aligned for\n(anti)ferromagnetic coupling. In real samples, the pinning potentials will tend to block the domain wall motion induced by the interlayer exchange. The presence of\nthe interlayer coupling will help enhance the DW motion\nabove the critical current after overcoming the pinning\npotentials, if the condition is right. In the experiment,10\nonly one-way motion of DW (probably along the magnetization of Co layer) under spin current is reported. According to the interlayer exchange coupling, the wrong\nway motion of DW will be suppressed by the interlayer\ntorque. This will be a critical test of the interlayer exchange torque in the spin valve system.\nOur model study can be equally applied to the ferromagnetic nanowire with the magnetic tunnel junction\nstructure. Slonczewski23 predicted the exchange interaction between two ferromagnetic layers which are separated by the insulating barrier, even in the absence of\nthe perpendicular current flow. Since the effect of the\ninterlayer exchange coupling gets larger with larger couplings, the thinner insulating barrier will be more favorable. Another strong point of the MTJ spin valves will\nbe a weaker dependence of the interlayer exchange coupling on the current in plane. In the case of nonmagnetic\nmetallic spacer, the electric current may well generate the\nelectron-hole excitations and disrupt the spin coherence\n\n\f3\nso that the interlayer exchange coupling is reduced just\nlike the thermal excitation. At least, this disruption is\n\n1\n\n2\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\nSee, for example, recent review articles in the special issue\n(current perspectives on spin transfer torques) of J.
