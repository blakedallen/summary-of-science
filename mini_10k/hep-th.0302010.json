To study this, one has to consider nonsupersymmetric theories. Therefore, investigations of this kind of phenomena are difficult, in general.\nIn this paper, our interest is on condensations of tachyons which can propagate in the bulk. What\nwe have to clarify would be the following two questions. The first one is into what theory the original\ntachyonic theory decays, and the second one is how to analyze the decay. The answer to the latter is,\nin principle, clear; one can use a closed string field theory [1], or matrix formulations of string theories\nand M-theory [2][3][4]. However, such an analysis will be, in practice, difficult to perform. The former\nquestion is more difficult to answer. There are two naive expectations for endpoints of the decay. One\npossibility is to decay into a non-critical string theory, since the Zamolodchikov's c-theorem [5] states that\nthe central charge of a worldsheet theory decreases via a relevant deformation. The other is discussed\nin our previous paper [6]. We argued that there may be a process which connects two critical string\ntheories via a tachyon condensation, when the corresponding low energy effective theory has a scalar\npotential, two of whose critical points correspond to these critical string theories. We also argued that\nsince the theory flows into a strong coupling theory, the worldsheet analysis, i.e. arguments based on the\nc-theorem, might be irrelevant for the dynamics of string theory.\nIn this paper, we will employ the low energy effective theory as a tool, and try to answer the two\nquestions mentioned above. The results of our investigations are summarized as follows. The Zamolodchikov's c-function of a sigma model is equal to the action functional of the corresponding low energy\neffective theory [7]. This expression of the c-function was used recently [8] to show that worldsheet renormalization group flows of a kind correspond to processes which are favored energetically. The relation\nbetween the c-function and the effective action can be naturally generalized, and as a result, the decrease\nof the c-function is related to the decrease of the total energy of the spacetime theory, when the dilaton is trivial. Otherwise, the relation between the c-function and the energy does not necessarily hold.\nTherefore, we would like to claim that the c-theorem cannot always be a guide to deduce endpoints of\nthe decay. We further study the final states of the decay by using the low energy effective theory which\ncan be regarded as the zeroth-order approximation of the closed string field theory. In some cases, one\ncan relate an evolution of the tachyon vev to a deformation of the geometry of a manifold on which string\ntheory or M-theory are compactified.\nAs we will show in this paper, the use of the effective theory, in particular a gauged supergravity,\nwould be very fruitful for the investigations of bulk tachyon condensations. We can obtain some explicit\nresults since some of the effective theories have been studied exhaustively. More detailed information of\nother gauged supergravities, in particular a relation to string theory and M-theory, will be valuable for\nthe study of tachyon condensations.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we review the results of [6]. In section 3 we discuss a\ntachyon condensation different from those in [6], in which the worldsheet analysis would not break down.\nWe suggest here that there is a subtlety on the comparison of central charges when the background\nchanges during the process. In section 4, we generalize the expression of [7]. We then argue how it\nis related to the energy and how the decrease of the c-function can deviate from the decrease of the\nspacetime energy. In section 5, we deduce the possible endpoints of bulk tachyon condensations based on\nthe analysis of the scalar potentials of the low energy effective theories. Section 6 is devoted to discussion.\n\n2\n\nWorldsheet RG\n\nAs we have learned from the study of condensations of open string tachyons [9] and localized closed string\ntachyons [10], there is a prescription to deduce an endpoint of the tachyon condensations. Suppose that\n2\n\n\fthere is a string theory with a tachyon in its mass spectrum. Then a condensation of the tachyon can\nbe described by adding the corresponding vertex operator to the worldsheet action. The added operator\nis usually taken to be a zero-momentum tachyon vertex and it is a relevant operator. The condensation\nwould make a change of the worldsheet theory to cure the instability indicated by the presence of the\ntachyon. The endpoint of the condensation is believed to be described by a theory which is the IR fixed\npoint of the RG flow induced by the relevant operator.\nIt is tempting to speculate that this prescription would also apply to condensations of tachyons\npropagating in the bulk. However, there seems to be a puzzle concerning the central charge of the\nworldsheet theory.\nThe tree level dynamics of strings in a non-trivial background is described by a non-linear sigma\nmodel. The background field configuration is encoded in coupling functions of the sigma model. For the\nsigma model to be conformal, beta-functionals of the coupling functions must vanish, and this condition is\nequivalent to the on-shell condition of the background fields. Since one imposes the conformal invariance,\nthe corresponding string theory is critical, that is, its central charge is zero after adding contributions\nfrom the ghosts.\nAssume that a string theory in a background contains a tachyon propagating in the bulk. The presence\nof the tachyon would be a signal of an instability of the background, and the theory would be deformed\nso as to cure such the instability. This process would be realized via a condensation of the tachyon, as in\nthe case of open string tachyons [9] and of localized closed string tachyons [10]. (See also [11] for earlier\nstudy on this phenomena.) During the condensation of localized closed string tachyons, it is claimed\nthat the central charge does not decrease, due to the fact that the relevant space for the tachyons has an\ninfinite volume [12]. This argument does not apply to situations in which tachyons come from a compact\nspace. Also in the case of bulk tachyons, one cannot conclude that the central charge does not need to\ndecrease. Therefore, according to the above discussions, one might expect that a condensation of a bulk\ntachyon would lead the theory to a non-critical string theory.\nOn the other hand, the same situation could be investigated by using the spacetime effective theory\n[6]. Suppose that there is a non-linear sigma model, the bosonic part of whose low energy effective action\nis\n\u0014\nZ\n1\n1\n\u22122\u03a6\nD \u221a\nS =\nR + 4\u2202\u03bc \u03a6\u2202 \u03bc \u03a6 \u2212 H\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 H \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\n\u2212ge\nd\nx\n2\n2\u03ba\n12\ni\na\nb\u03bc\u03bd\n\u2212 fab (\u03c6)F\u03bc\u03bd F\n\u2212 gIJ (\u03c6)D\u03bc \u03c6I D\u03bc \u03c6J \u2212 V (\u03c6) .\n(2.1)\nThe action of this form appears, for example, in the heterotic string theory compactified on a torus with\nflux [13]. Suppose that the scalar potential has an unstable critical point \u03c6I = \u03c6I1 . If there is another\ncritical point \u03c6I = \u03c6I2 which is less unstable than \u03c6I = \u03c6I1 and V (\u03c61 ) > V (\u03c62 ), then it would be natural\nto expect that the former vacuum decays into the latter vacuum via a condensation of scalar fields, i.e., a\nshift of the vevs. This process would be interpreted as a bulk tachyon condensation. However, both vacua\n\u03c6I = \u03c6I1 , \u03c6I2 , with appropriate backgrounds, are classical solutions of the effective theory (2.1). Therefore,\neach vacuum defines a critical string theory with vanishing central charge, and thus the central charge\ndoes not decrease during the process. Note that \u03b1\u2032 -corrections could be controlled when the effective\ntheory (2.1) possesses some amount of spacetime supersymmetry.\nA possible resolution of this puzzle was proposed in [6]. It is summarized as follows. The decay\ndiscussed above indeed decrease the central charge, which can be shown in the range of validity of the\ntree level approximation, but whole trajectory of the decay process in the theory space does not lie within\nthe range, and comparison of central charges of initial and final theories is not possible.\nLet us explain our claim mentioned above. To be definite, we consider Type II string theory. The\n\n3\n\n\fspacetime effective action of the NS-NS fields (GMN , BMN , \u03a6) is\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n\u221a\n1\n1\n2\n\u22122\u03a6\nLMN\n10\n\u02c6\nR + 4(\u2207\u03a6) \u2212 HLMN H\n.\nS = 2 d x \u2212Ge\n2\u03ba\n12\n\n(2.2)\n\n\u02c6 M are the scalar curvature and the covariant derivative with respect to the metric GMN , and\nHere R, \u2207\nHLMN is the field strength of BMN .\nOne can obtain a low energy effective action in d dimensions via a compactification. In the ordinary\ntoroidal compactifications, the reduction is performed by constructing the fields in terms of fields in d\ndimensions\n\u0014\n\u0015\ng\u03bc\u03bd + Al\u03bc A\u03bdl A\u03bcm\nGMN =\n,\netc.\n(2.3)\nA\u03bdn\nGmn\nand substituting them into the action (2.2). Here \u03bc, \u03bd = 0, * * * , d \u2212 1 label non-compact directions and\nm, n = d, * * * , 9 label compact (internal) directions. In the toroidal compactifications, g\u03bc\u03bd etc. are taken\nto be independent of the internal coordinates y m .\nOne can consider a more general compactification by allowing some d-dimensional fields to be y m dependent, and such a reduction will produce a non-trivial scalar potential in the reduced action. This is\nknown as the Scherk-Schwarz reduction [14]. We will derive the reduced action below. For simplicity, we\nwill omit terms including gauge fields A\u03bcm in d dimensions. The resulting action is meaningful as long\nas we consider classical solutions with constant scalars, i.e., vacuum solutions.\nThe reduction ansatz we make is\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\ng\u03bc\u03bd (x)\n0\nB\u03bc\u03bd (x)\n0\nGMN =\n,\nBMN =\n,\n\u03a6 = \u03a6(x)\n(2.4)\n0\nGmn (x, y)\n0\nBmn (x, y)\nBy substituting this ansatz into (2.2), one obtains\n\u0014\nZ\n1\n1\n\u22122\u03c6\n10 \u221a\nR + 4(\u2207\u03c6)2 \u2212 H\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 H \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\n\u2212ge\nS =\nd\nx\n2\u03ba2\n12\n\u0015\n1\n1\n+ \u2207Gmn * \u2207Gmn \u2212 Gkm Gln \u2207Bkl * \u2207Bmn \u2212 V ,\n4\n4\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere\n\u03c6 =\nV\n\n=\n\n1\nlog det G,\n4\n1\n\u2212Gmn Rmn + Gil Gjm Gkn Hijk Hlmn .\n12\n\u03a6\u2212\n\n(2.6)\n(2.7)\n\nHere R, \u2207\u03bc are the scalar curvature and the covariant derivative with respect to the metric g\u03bc\u03bd , and Rmn\nis the Ricci tensor with respect to Gmn . If the integrand is independent of y m , the action (2.5) can be\nregarded as an effective action in d dimensions with a suitable rescaling of \u03ba.\nFor later purpose, we show the equations of motion of Gmn , Bmn ,\nRmn + * * * =\nGkl \u2207k Hlmn + * * * =\n\n0,\n0,\n\n(2.8)\n(2.9)\n\nwhere * * * denotes terms including \u2207\u03bc Gmn , \u2207\u03bc Bmn .

Since \u03b2mn = 0, \u03b2mn = 0 coincide with the equations of motion of Gmn , Bmn ,\nrespectively, one can take a background\ng\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\u03c6I = const.\n\nB\u03bc\u03bd = 0,\n\n\u03a6 = const.,\n\u2202V\nsuch that\n= 0,\n\u2202\u03c6I\n\n(2.19)\n\nand obtains the central charge\nc = 6\u03b2 \u03a6\n\n1\n= \u2212 Gil Gjm Gkn Hijk Hlmn\n4\n3\nV.\n=\n2\n\n(2.20)\n\nSuppose that the scalar potential V has two critical points \u03c6I = \u03c6I1 , \u03c6I2 with V (\u03c61 ) > V (\u03c62 ), and\n\u03c6 = \u03c6I1 corresponds to an unstable vacuum. If V (\u03c61 ) = 0, then (2.19) is indeed a classical solution and\nit defines a perturbative vacuum with vanishing central charge. This vacuum would be expected to decay\ninto the second vacuum \u03c6I = \u03c6I2 , but since V (\u03c62 ) < 0, the corresponding classical solution would be a\nlinear dilaton background and worldsheet analyses in this background would not be reliable due to string\nloop corrections. What we can say at least is that the configuration (2.19) with \u03c6I = \u03c6I2 would be in the\nvicinity of the linear dilaton background in the theory space and the central charge for the configuration\nis smaller than the initial central charge, due to (2.20).\nThis result would be interpreted as follows. The transition from (2.19) with \u03c6I1 to that with \u03c6I2 would\ncorrespond to a condensation of a bulk tachyon. It is natural since this is a shift of vevs of the scalars,\nand the central charge of the sigma model decreases. The transition from (2.19) with \u03c6I2 to the linear\ndilaton background would be a backreaction of the condensation. During this process, the dilaton behaves\nnon-trivially and the worldsheet analyses would not valid. Note that the real process would not be able\nI\n\n5\n\n\fto devided into such two periods, and the direct investigation of such a simultaneous process would be\ndifficult.\nIf V (\u03c62 ) = 0, the endpoint of the decay is well understood. However, in this case the initial unstable\nvacuum would be strongly-coupled, by assumption, and the investigation of whole process of the decay\nwould be also difficult.\nTo summarize, it seem to be good to apply the RG prescription to bulk tachyon condensations, but\nit might not be so useful since the backreaction would change the background drastically.\n\n3\n\nRolling down with constant dilaton\n\nAs we briefly commented in [6], when the scalar potential does not depend on the dilaton, transitions\nbetween critical points of the potential would occur without going into a strongly-coupled string theory.\nThen the same puzzle discussed in the beginning of the previous section will reappear in these cases.\nThus we have to investigate such cases and find what is going on.\nWe would like to consider a string theory whose low energy effective theory contains a non-trivial\nscalar potential which is a function independent of the dilaton \u03a6. There is a supergravity theory of this\nkind [16][17] which is familiar in the study of AdS/CFT correspondence [18]. This is a five-dimensional\ntheory with maximal supersymmetry, which is believed to be a consistent truncation of Type IIB supergravity compactified on S 5 . It contains 42 scalars which is identified with the coordinates of the\ncoset E6(6) /U Sp(4), and the scalar potential is a function on the coset. The potential is invariant under\nSL(2, R) \u2282 E6(6) , and this corresponds to the SL(2, R) invariance of Type IIB supergravity. Thus the\npotential is independent of the dilaton. Note that we have discussed in the Einstein frame. In the string\nframe, the scalar potential would be multiplied by an exponential of \u03a6.\nThe scalar potential has many critical points [16][19][20][21] and they are interpreted, in AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence, IR fixed points of the N =4 super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions perturbed by\nrelevant deformations. Then, according to the correspondence, transitions between the critical points\nwould also be relevant deformations of the corresponding Type IIB string theory. Therefore AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence would imply that there may be such a process which connects two critical string theories\ncorresponding to the critical points, although along the whole process the tree level approximation seems\nto be reliable.\nSince the relation between the five-dimensional supergravity mentioned above and a sigma model\nis not clear, the investigation of this case is not possible. However, the problem is more general and\nit can be stated as follows. If \u03a6 =const. is a classical solution regardless of the value of the scalar\npotential, then tachyon condensations could occur without going into a strong coupling background and\nthe RG prescription for tachyon condensations would not apply to this case. Below we will argue that the\nsituation is quite different from the ones discussed in the previous section and the comparison of central\ncharges would be a subtle issue.\nWhat we have done in the previous section is to consider background field configurations satisfying\nG\n\u03b2MN\nB\n\u03b2MN\n\n\u03a6\n\n\u02c6 N \u03a6 \u2212 1 HMKL HN KL = 0,\n\u02c6M\u2207\n= RMN + 2\u2207\n4\n1 \u02c6L\nL\n\u02c6 \u03a6 HLMN = 0,\n= \u2212 \u2207 HLMN + \u2207\n2\n= const.\n\n(3.1)\n(3.2)\n(3.3)\n\nThe configurations are not necessarily on-shell configurations since the last condition (3.3) is not equivalent to \u03b2 \u03a6 = 0.\n\n6\n\n\fWhen we further require that (3.3) satisfies the equation of motion of \u03a6, the allowed configurations\nare only on-shell configurations. One can see this from the fact that the equation of motion of \u03a6 can be\nrewritten as\n0 =\n=\n\n\u02c6 2 \u03a6 \u2212 4(\u2207\u03a6)\n\u02c6 2 \u2212 1 H2\nR + 4\u2207\n12\nMN G\n\u03a6\nG\n\u03b2MN \u2212 4\u03b2 ,\n\n(3.4)\n\nG\ni.e., the equation of motion of \u03a6 is equivalent to \u03b2 \u03a6 = 0 provided that \u03b2MN\n= 0.\nLet us reconsider central charges in this case. Since for every critical point of the scalar potential\none has to take an on-shell solution in order to ensure the existence of the Virasoro algebra, one cannot\nobtain, in this approach, a sigma model with a non-zero central charge. Therefore it is tempting to\nconclude that in this case central charge does not change in the decay process.\nHowever, there is a difference from the cases in the previous section. In those cases, the background\ngeometry can be always taken to be flat, but in this case, since the background has to be on-shell, the\nspacetime is curved according to the value of the scalar potential. Thus one has to compare central\ncharges for different background geometries. Recall that the central charge is a measure of the degrees of\nfreedom whose definition strongly depends on the background geometry. Thus a naive comparison would\nnot make sense. In the next section, we will argue a relation between the central charge of sigma models\nand the energy of the system in the spacetime sense, and a similar subtlety will appear there.\n\n4\n\nCentral charge as spacetime energy\n\nWe have discussed the central charge of a sigma model in a special situation in which all but one betafunctional for the background fields vanish. There is an expression of the central charge, or c-function,\nfor a more general situation [7].\nThe Zamolodchikov's c-function C(r) is defined in terms of correlation functions of a two-dimensional\nfield theory,\n3\n(4.1)\nC(r) = 2F (r) \u2212 G(r) \u2212 H(r),\n8\nwhere r2 = z z\u0304 and\nF (r)\nG(r)\n\n=\n=\n\nz 4 hTzz (z, z\u0304)Tzz (0, 0)i,\n4z 3 z\u0304hTzz (z, z\u0304)Tzz\u0304 (0, 0)i\n\nH(r)\n\n=\n=\n\n4z 3 z\u0304hTzz\u0304 (z, z\u0304)Tzz (0, 0)i,\n16z 2 z\u0304 2 hTzz\u0304 (z, z\u0304)Tzz\u0304 (0, 0)i \u2265 0.\n\n(4.2)\n\nWe have assumed the rotational invariance. Then the derivative of C(r) is non-positive\nr\n\nd\n3\nC(r) = \u2212 H(r),\ndr\n4\n\n(4.3)\n\ndue to the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor.\nThe sigma model considered in [7] corresponds to the \"spatial part\" of the sigma model describing\na string theory. Thus the background fields of the sigma model consist of Gmn , Bmn , \u03a6 in our notation.\nThe c-function (4.1) is given in terms of the fields, and it is shown that the derivative of the c-function\nis non-positive and the vanishing of the derivative means that the sigma model is conformal. Explicitly,\n\n7\n\n\fthe c-function is given as\nZ \u221e\ndk\nf (rk) * 2\u03ba2 S(k),\nC(r) =\nk\n0\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n\u221a \u22122\u03a6\n1\n1\nlmn\n10\u2212d\nm\nm\n.\nd\nx Ge\nS(k) =\nR \u2212 4\u2207m \u03a6\u2207 \u03a6 + 4\u2207 \u2207m \u03a6 \u2212 Hlmn H\n2\u03ba2\n12\n\n(4.4)\n(4.5)\n\nHere f (x) is a function which is necessary for the Fourier transformation from k to r. By integrating\nby parts, it is shown that S(k) is a part of the low energy effective action. The dependence on k, the\nrenormalization scale, of S(k) comes from that of the fields themselves.\nThe equation (4.4) relates the c-function to the effective action. This relation is natural for several\nreasons. Firstly, since both the conformal invariance condition and the on-shell condition can be characterized by the extremization of c-function and the effective action, respectively, the equivalence of these\ntwo conditions would imply the relation like (4.4). It would be more apparent when the RG equations\nare written as follows,\n\u0015\n\u0014\nd\n1\n\u03b4S\n2\u03ba2\n\u03b4S\nk Gmn = \u221a e2\u03a6\n,\netc.\n(4.6)\n+\nG\nmn\ndk\n\u03b4Gmn\n4\n\u03b4\u03a6\nG\nG\nSecondly, under the condition \u03b2mn\n= 0, the action can be written as\nZ\n\u221a\n1\nS(k) = 2 d10\u2212d x Ge\u22122\u03a6 (\u22124)\u03b2 \u03a6 .\n2\u03ba\n\n(4.7)\n\nTherefore it is consistent with the fact that the central charge is proportional to \u03b2 \u03a6 under the conditions\ndiscussed previously.\nIt is well-known that the value of the Zamolodchikov's c-function at a conformal fixed point is equal\nto the central charge of the conformal theory. For the c-function (4.4), however, it is not the case. This\nis because in [7] the c-function is derived from correlators which are not normalized as usual, and in\nparticular,\nZ\n\u221a\n(4.8)\nh1i = V (k) \u2261 d10\u2212d x Ge\u22122\u03a6 .\nThen the central charge should be related to S(k)/V (k), and it need not be a monotonic function due\nto the scale dependent factor V (k). In other words, the decreasing quantity is the c-function, not the\ncentral charge. Moreover, when V (k) \u2192 \u221e, the central charge does not change even when the c-function\ndecreases by a finite amount. This fact would explain why the central charge does not decrease during\ncondensations of localized closed string tachyons [12].\nThe natural extension of (4.4) to the c-function of a sigma model for whole spacetime would be to\nreplace S(k) with the total spacetime effective action Stotal (k). It is known that the spacetime action\nis equal to the time integral of the Hamiltonian (times \u22121) under some conditions [22]. Therefore, as\ndiscussed in [8], the c-function is related to the energy of the system in the spacetime sense. From this\npoint of view, the meaning of the c-theorem is very clear; the physical process occurs toward a state with\nlower energy than the initial one. One can also see from this relation that the comparison of central\ncharges for different backgrounds is a subtle issue; this corresponds to comparing energies defined in\ndifferent background geometries.\nWhen the dilaton has a non-trivial configuration, however, one has to be careful not to conclude\nimmediately that decreasing the c-function corresponds to decreasing the energy. It is because the\neffective action related to the c-function is written in the string frame, while the action related to the\nenergy is in the Einstein frame. Their difference is a surface term, and it is irrelevant for the constant\ndilaton case [8] but otherwise would change the value of the action and the relation between the c-function\nand the energy may break down. This would be another explanation why the RG prescription for tachyon\ncondensation would not valid for analysis of whole process of the condensation.\n\n8\n\n\f5\n\nInternal space geometry from scalar vevs\n\nIn the previous section, we have discussed the relation between the c-function of a sigma model and\nthe action of the low energy effective theory, which can be related to the total spacetime energy of the\nsystem. This relation would provide a clear understanding of the c-theorem; the energetically-favored\nprocess occurs physically. Moreover, a slight difference between the c-function obtained in [7] and the\ntotal energy would suggest that there might be some modification of the c-theorem when the dilaton\nbecomes non-trivially, that is, the tree level approximation for string theory is not reliable.\nIn the rest of this paper, we will show another use of the spacetime theory to investigate a condensation\nof a closed string tachyon propagating in the bulk. That is, we deduce a final state of the tachyon\ncondensation.\nWe consider in this section a gauged supergravity which is a consistent truncation of a string theory\nor M-theory compactified on a non-trivial manifold. The theory has a scalar potential, which has many\ncritical points. Some of them correspond to stable vacua of the theory, and the others to unstable vacua.\nWhen one defines the theory on one of the unstable vacua, it would be deformed via a condensation of\nan unstable mode, until the theory will reach another vacuum which is then stable. Therefore, one can\nobtain the knowledge of the condensation by examining the shape of the scalar potential.\nRecall that the scalars in the gauged supergravity in lower dimensions originally come, in principle,\nfrom fields of a theory in higher dimensions, for example, metric of the internal manifold. Thus the vevs\nof the scalars in a lower dimensional theory should have information of the target space geometry in a\nhigher dimensional theory. This is indeed the case, and some of the critical points of the scalar potential\nare related to some internal manifolds [18]. Moreover, in a particular case, there is a general formula\n[23] to obtain the metric of the internal manifold from the vevs of the scalars. It is clear that bulk\ntachyon condensations inevitably deform background geometries, since they cannot be decoupled from\nthe bulk gravity. Therefore it is important to know how the background geometry is deformed via the\ntachyon condensation. The relation between the scalar vevs and the internal geometry will enable one to\ninvestigate it.\nThe most interesting final state of the condensation would be the most stable vacuum. In ordinary\nsupersymmetric field theory without gravity, the most stable vacua is the states with zero energy. This is\nalso the case for open string tachyon condensations in superstring [9]. However, in supergravity theories\nthe situation is different since its scalar potential is not necessarily non-negative. Moreover, in many\ncases the potential is not even bounded below. Naively, in such cases, the system would roll down the\npotential eternally toward the \"bottom\". Thus it would be interesting to ask to what kind of theory it is\ndeformed by such an evolution of the scalar vevs. We discuss this issue below with explicit examples.\n\n5.1\n\nM-theory on S 7\n\nIn this subsection, we discuss an N = 8 gauged supergravity in four dimensions [24], which is a consistent\ntruncation of the eleven-dimensional supergravity compactified on S 7 [25]. This theory has been wellstudied and several critical points of its scalar potential have been found [26].\nS 7 can be regarded as an S 1 -bundle over CP 3 . Therefore, M-theory compactified on S 7 can be\nregarded as Type IIA string theory compactified on CP 3 with R-R fluxes. From this, we can regard\ninstabilities which appear in the gauged supergravity as unstable modes of the Type IIA strings. Since\nthe eleven-dimensional metric of the classical solution is a direct product AdS4 \u00d7 S 7 , the R-R fluxes do\nnot depend on the non-compact (AdS) coordinates. If there is an unstable mode coming from scalars,\nit is a tachyon in the bulk and thus its condensation would decrease the effective c-function discussed in\nsection 4. The situation considered is similar to the Melvin background in M-theory [27], except for the\ncompactness of the relevant geometry.\n9\n\n\fThe gauged supergravity contains 70 scalars which can be identified with the coordinates of the coset\nE7(7) /SU (8). It is convenient to represent them in terms of a group element of the E7(7) which acts on\nthe 56 representation,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nuij IJ vijKL\nV=\n.\n(5.1)\nv\u0304 klIJ \u016bkl\nKL\nWe follow the notations and conventions of [28]. The indices take values from 1 to 8, and ij, KL etc. are\nanti-symmetrized. Note that an SU (8) part of V is not physical degrees of freedom.\nThe scalar potential is given as\nP(V) =\n\n3\n1\n|A2 |2 \u2212 |A1 |2 ,\n24\n4\n\n(5.2)\n\nwhere the tensors A1 ij and A2 i jkl are complicated functions of u and v in (5.1). One can see that the\npotential has a negative-definite term, and this potential is indeed unbounded below.\nThe directions along which the P(V) diverges in a limit correspond to the non-compact directions\nof E7(7) , or more conveniently, the non-compact directions of SL(8, R) \u2282 E7(7) . Explicitly, we consider\none-parameter subgroups of E7(7) corresponding to\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb as\ne 1\na\ns\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\ne 2\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u2208 SL(8, R),\n(5.3)\nX =\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n.\n..\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\ne a8 s\nP\nwith\nak = 0. The explicit form of the potential (5.2) has been calculated in special cases [29], by using\nas V the element of the one-parameter subgroup corresponding to (5.3),\nP7,1\nP6,2\nP5,3\nP4,4\n\n1\n(\u221235e2s \u2212 14e\u22126s + e\u221214s ),\n8\n= \u22123(e2s + e\u22122s ),\n3\n= \u2212 (5e2s + 10e\u22122s/3 + e\u221210s/3 ),\n8\n= \u2212(e2s + 4 + e\u22122s ),\n=\n\n(5.4)\n(5.5)\n(5.6)\n(5.7)\n\nwhere Pp,8\u2212p is the potential (5.2) for the element (5.3) with\na1 = * * * = ap , ap+1 = * * * = a8 ,\n\n(5.8)\n\nand their values are suitably chosen. This corresponds to the direction which preserves SO(p)\u00d7 SO(8 \u2212 p)\nsymmetry. Note that Pp,q (s) = Pq,p (\u2212ps/q). A point s = 0 is always a critical point which corresponds\nto the round S 7 . One can see that there are directions along which P \u2192 \u2212\u221e as |s| \u2192 \u221e.\nAs mentioned above, the vevs of the scalars contain information of the deformation of S 7 . How S 7 is\ndeformed for |s| \u2192 \u221e ? To investigate it, one has to reconstruct the metric of the S 7 from the scalar vevs.\nThis was achieved in [23], and in particular, the simple formula for the metric for the vevs corresponding\nto (5.3) was obtained. The S 7 is deformed to an ellipsoid defined by\n(x1 , * * * , x8 ) \u2208 R8 ,\n\nxm Pmn xn = const.,\n\n(5.9)\n\nwhere P = X 2 , and the metric on this ellipsoid is the induced metric with a scale factor \u03bc,\ngmn\n\u03bc2\n\n=\n=\n\n22/9 \u03bc\u22122/3 (\u03b4mn \u2212 n\u0302m n\u0302n ),\nxm Pml Pln xn ,\n\n(5.10)\n(5.11)\n\nwhere n\u0302m is the unit normal vector of the ellipsoid. From this result, one can see that the xk -direction\nshrinks (extends) when ak > 0 (ak < 0) as s \u2192 +\u221e, when the overall factor is ignored. Since X is an\n10\n\n\felement of SL(8, R), not all the directions simultaniously shrink or extend. In other words, there must\nbe a direction which extends as the scalar vevs grow.\nAmong the directions for P \u2192 \u2212\u221e, an interesting case would be the direction which preserves\nSO(2) \u00d7 SO(6) symmetry. In this case, the deformed S 7 is given as\ne3t ((x1 )2 + (x2 )2 ) + e\u2212t ((x3 )2 + * * * + (x8 )2 ) = \u03c12\n\nin R8 , and t \u221d s.

Therefore, in the large t limit, the ellipsoid is approximately the direct product of the\nsix-dimensional flat space and the small S 1 with a constant radius, as long as r\u0303 << et/2 . By choosing\nthis S 1 as the M-theory circle, this limiting theory would be regarded as a weak coupling Type IIA string\ntheory. Thus this might suggest that a tachyon condensation of this theory would have a final state which\nis a weakly-coupled Type IIA string theory in the flat spacetime. Note that no R-R 1-form appears via\nthe dimensional reduction. Since the S 1 chosen above is not the same circle with the one, reducing along\nwhich provides Type IIA string theory compactified on CP 3 , the relation between the initial and the\nfinal states would be non-trivial.\nHowever, the argument given above is too naive since we did not take into account the overall factor\n\u03bc. In fact, the proper metric is, up to a trivial numerical factor,\n\u0015\n\u0013\n\u0014\u0012\n2\n2\nt 2\n2\n\u22123t\n2\n2\nt\n\u22123t r\n2\n2 \u22122/3\n(5.18)\ndr + e r d\u03a95 + e (1 \u2212 r )d\u03b8 ,\ne +e\ndsM = \u03c1 \u03bc\n1 \u2212 r2\n\u03bc2\n\n=\n\ne3t (1 \u2212 r2 ) + e\u2212t r2 .\n\n(5.19)\n\nThrough the dimensional reduction along the \u03b8 direction, one obtains the metric for the corresponding\nType IIA string theory\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\np\nr2\n2\nt 2\n2\nds2IIA = \u03c12 e\u22123t/2 \u03bc\u22121 1 \u2212 r2 et + e\u22123t\ndr\n+\ne\nr\nd\u03a9\n(5.20)\n5 .\n1 \u2212 r2\nThen, one can calculate the size of this space and show that\nZ 1\n\u221a\ndr grr \u2192 0 (t \u2192 \u221e).\n\n(5.21)\n\n0\n\nTherefore, the internal space becomes small as the scalar vevs grow. Note that the radius of the M-theory\ncircle we chose is small everywhere for large t, so that the resulting theory should be a weak coupling\ntheory. However, the compactification manifold is a strange one, and the resulting theory would not be\nfamiliar for us.\nA similar phenomenon will occur in M-theory compactified on S 4 , although the relation to string\ntheory would be unclear. The consistent truncation of the eleven-dimensional supergravity is a sevendimensional supergravity [30]. The explicit form of the scalar potential along SO(2)\u00d7 SO(3)-invariant direction was obtained in [31], and the internal metric was constructed [32] in terms of the seven-dimensional\nfields.\n11\n\n\f5.2\n\nType IIB string theory on S 5\n\nSince the analysis in this case is parallel to that in the previous subsection, we will discuss briefly.\nThe truncated theory is believed to be the five-dimensional gauged supergravity mentioned before,\nand critical points of its scalar potential is well-studied. In fact, some of them are shown to be unstable\n[19][21]. Such an unstable vacuum would decay via a tachyon condensation, and as a result, the scalar\nvev would roll down the potential toward its \"bottom\".\nAs before, we focus on the direction which is invariant under SO(2) \u00d7 SO(4). The explicit expression\nof the potential restricted to this direction parametrized be \u03bb is [16]\n1\nP(\u03bb) = \u2212 (e2\u03bb + 2e\u2212\u03bb ).\n4\n\n(5.22)\n\nNote that the critical point \u03bb = 0 is the maximally supersymmetric vacuum, so that it cannot decay into\n|\u03bb| \u2192 \u221e. However, some other unstable vacua might decay into a direction toward |\u03bb| \u2192 \u221e.\nThe formula for the metric of the internal S 5 in terms of the five-dimensional fields was conjectured\nin [21], and in particular, along the SO(2) \u00d7 SO(4)-invariant direction the S 5 is expected to be deformed\nto an ellipsoid\ne\u22122t ((x1 )2 + (x2 )2 ) + et ((x3 )2 + * * * + (x6 )2 ) = \u03c12 .\n(5.23)\nTherefore, based on the same analysis in the previous subsection, this background will approach a strange\nmanifold which is an S 1 -bundle and the radius is small. Since we have considered Type IIB string theory,\nthis final theory could be regarded as Type IIA string theory compactified on a small four-dimensional\nmanifold.\n\n6\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe have investigated the condensations of the bulk closed string tachyons by using the spacetime effective\ntheory. It would be the most suitable situation in which the effective theory is a gauged supergravity, and\nthen the tachyons appear when one choose an unstable vacuum. The spacetime supersymmetry strongly\nrestrict the dynamics, so that it should be expected that one could control part of quantum corrections,\neven when one would like to analyze a non-supersymmetric background.\nWe have considered only the cases in which the gauge group is compact. This is because one can\nrelate the vevs of the scalars to the geometry of the internal manifold. There are many other gauged\nsupergravities with non-compact gauge groups, and critical points of the scalar potentials were found\n[29][16]. However, their geometric origins do not seem to be understood well until now. It is expected\nthat relations between such gauged supergravities and higher dimensional theories would provide us more\nexamples of bulk tachyon condensations, and our understanding of the condensations would become\ndeeper. A proposed correspondence [33] will be relevant in this direction of research.\nAnother generalization can be considered. Since we have focused on the maximally supersymmetric\ntheories, the scalar potentials are completely determined by the supersymmetry. It is plausible since then\nwe can obtain explicit formulae. But if we would like to have a more general potential to consider a\nmore general situation, we have to reduce the number of supersymmetry. There is a nice characterization\nof a kind of N = 2 gauged supergravities in four dimensions. They can be realized as the low energy\neffective theory of Type II string theory compactified on a manifold with the SU(3) structure (see e.g.\n[34] and references theirin). A six-dimensional manifold M with the SU(3) structure admits a single\nSU(3) invariant spinor on M which is not required to be covariantly constant. For this reason, the\n12\n\n\ffour-dimensional Minkowski spacetime is not, in general, a classical solution of the effective theory, that\nis, there is a non-trivial scalar potential. This realization of gauged supergravities will provide various\nexamples of theories with unstable vacua, and one could extract a general feature of the decays of them.\nThe investigation of a meaning of the SU(3) structure in terms of a two-dimensional theory is also\ninteresting, and would be important to understand the mirror symmetry in the presence of flux.\nWe have argued that the sigma model approach would not apply to whole process of the bulk tachyon\ncondensations. However, it would be still useful to study properties of each vacuum. It is well-known\nthat the notion of stability depends on what background the theory is defined [35]. To understand them\nin terms of the sigma model would be interesting.\nOur interest has been mainly on the bulk tachyon condensations. The usefulness of the spacetime\naction might, however, continue to hold for the localized tachyon condensations [10]. Localized tachyons\nusually come from twisted sectors, and thus it would be realized by just adding the corresponding matter\nfields in the effective action. Then it would be possible to do the similar analysis as we have done in this\npaper.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank T. Kimura, N. Sakai, T. Takayanagi and Y.
