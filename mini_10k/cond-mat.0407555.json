Box 692, 33101 Tampere, Finland\n(Dated: November 20, 2018)\nAngle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) presents significant simplications in analyzing strictly two-dimensional (2D) materials, but even the most anisotropic physical systems display\nsome residual three-dimensionality. Here we demonstrate how this third dimension manifests itself\nin ARPES spectra of quasi-2D materials by considering the example of the cuprate Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8\n(Bi2212). The intercell, interlayer hopping, which is responsible for kz -dispersion of the bands, is\nfound to induce an irreducible broadening to the ARPES lineshapes with a characteristic dependence\non the in-plane momentum kk . Our study suggests that ARPES lineshapes can provide a direct\nspectroscopic window for establishing the existence of coherent c-axis conductivity in a material\nvia the detection of this new broadening mechanism, and bears on the understanding of 2D to 3D\ncrossover and pseudogap and stripe physics in novel materials through ARPES experiments.\nPACS numbers: 79.60.-i, 71.18.+y, 74.72.Hs\n\nAngle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)\nhas been applied extensively in the recent years for investigating the electronic and quasiparticle properties of\nhigh-temperature superconductors1 . Much of the existing ARPES work on the cuprates and other quasi-2D\nmaterials implicitly assumes perfect two-dimensionality,\nignoring the effects of dispersion in the third dimension.\nAs energy resolutions of the order of a few meV's have\nnow become possible in the state-of-the-art ARPES instrumentation, it is natural to ask the question: How\nwill kz -dispersion play out in the ARPES spectra of the\nquasi-2D materials? An obvious answer is that spectral peaks will undergo shifts with photon energy \u2013albeit\nsmall\u2013 much like in the 3D case.3,4,5 Our analysis however\nreveals a very different scenario in that insofar as ARPES\nresponse to kz -dispersion is concerned, quasi-2D systems\ndiffer fundamentally from their 3D counterparts. We find\nthat in the presence of typical final state dampings of the\norder of eV's, initial state dispersions over much smaller\nenergy scales will not appear as energy shifts with h\u03bd,\nbut will instead induce an irreducible linewidth in the\nspectral peaks with a characteristic kk dependence.\nOur results bear on a variety of important issues in\ncuprate physics and give insight into a number of puzzling features of ARPES in the cuprates. Since our new\nbroadening mechanism does not have its origin in a scattering process, it explains why the lifetimes derived from\nARPES spectra are generally found to be shorter than\nthose obtained from other experiments. Moreover, Fermi\nsurface (FS) maps obtained via ARPES often display\nbroad patches of spectral weight rather than well-defined\nFS imprints, particularly near the antinodal point; such\npatches occur naturally in our calculations. Indeed, much\nof the pseudogap phenomena \u2013 in particular the lack of\nwell-defined quasiparticles near (\u03c0, 0) \u2013 will need to be\nreevaluated in light of the present findings. In this vein,\nthese results also impact the analysis of stripe physics\nthrough ARPES experiments. Finally, detection of the kz\n\nrelated linewidths in the ARPES spectra offers a unique\nspectroscopic window for establishing the existence of coherent c-axis conductivity and intercell coupling in a system; this important intrinsic property is not accessible\ndirectly through other techniques.1\nSpecifically, we focus in this article on the tetragonal body-centered Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8 (Bi2212) compound,\nwhich has been a workhorse of ARPES studies. Bi2212\nis a nearly 2D material with two CuO2 -layers in the\nprimitive unit cell. The intracell interaction between\nthe two CuO2 -layers, spaced a relatively short distance\nof \u223c 3.2 \u00c5 apart, results in the well-known bilayer\nsplitting1,6,7,8,9,10 . On the other hand, the intercell coupling between the bilayer slabs in different unit cells is\nexpected to be smaller due to the larger intercell Cu-Cu\ndistance of \u223c 12 \u00c5 resulting in weak but non-vanishing\nkz -dispersion. The intercell coupling will be even more\npronounced in other high-Tc's since Bi2212 presents one\nof the longest c-axes in the cuprate family.\nConcerning computational details, the band structure for Bi2212 was obtained within the local-densityapproximation (LDA) by using the well-established\nGreen's function methodology11 . The crystal potential\nused is the same as that employed in our previous studies of Bi2212 and involves 30 atoms per conventional unit\ncell6,7,12 , yielding good agreement with the experimentally observed Fermi surface (FS)10,13,14,15,16 . ARPES\nintensities have been computed within the one-step photoemission formalism; see, Refs. 6 and 7 for details.\nFigure 1(a), which considers the familiar antibonding\n(A) and bonding (B) bands in Bi2212, shows that the\nkk -dispersion depends strongly on kz as the associated\nbands wander over the two sets of shaded areas. The kz dispersion (i.e. the vertical width of the shaded areas)\ndisplays a striking dependence on kk and nearly vanishes\nat the antinodal point kk = (\u03c0/a, 0). A clear bilayer\nsplitting between the A and B bands is seen at all kvalues, except at kk = kk\u2217 = 0.2(2\u03c0/a) for kz = 0 (solid\n\n\f0\n\n0\n\n1\n0\n\nc)\n\na)\n\nk [2\u03c0/a]\n\n0.5\n\n||\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nA\n\n0\n\nb)\n\nk\n\nBE [eV]\n\nBinding energy [eV]\n\n0.2\n\nBE [eV]\n\n2\n\n0.8\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n1\n\n1\nB\n\n||\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\nk [2\u03c0/c]\n\n1\n\nz\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nk\n\n||\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n[2\u03c0/a]\n\nFIG. 1:\n(a): Calculated first-principles kk -dispersion in\nBi2212 along [100]-direction for the B and A bands at three\ndifferent kz values (in units of 2\u03c0/c): kz = 0 (solid lines);\nkz = 0.5 (dashed), and kz = 1 (dash-dotted).

This level crossing\nleads to the anomalous kz -dispersion shown in Fig. 1(b)\nfor the B band: The shape changes from being described\napproximately by the form sin2 (kz c/4) for kk = 0, to\n| sin(kz c/4)| at kk\u2217 , and finally back to sin2 (kz c/4) for\nkk a/(2\u03c0) = 0.5. The antibonding band behaves similarly (not shown for brevity). The complex behavior of\nthe bilayer splitting and the kz -dispersion shown in the\nfirst-principles computations of Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) can\nbe modeled reasonably well by a relatively simple tightbinding (TB) Hamiltonian as seen from Fig. 1(c). We\nreturn below to discuss this point further.\nWe next turn our attention to how kz -dispersion will\nmanifest itself in ARPES spectra. The key insight in\nthis regard is provided by the simulations17 of Fig. 2,\nwhich consider the evolution of the lineshape of the energy distribution curves (EDCs) as the final state broadening introduced via the imaginary part of the final state\nself-energy18 , \u03a3\u2032\u2032f , is increased from a very small value\nin (a) to a realistic value in (c). In (a), the position\nof the spectral peak undergoes the familiar shift as h\u03bd\nvaries. This shift results from the fact that in the photoexcitation process kk must remain unchanged in transmission of the electron across the surface and the initial\nand final states can connect only at a specific value of\nkz in order to conserve energy. Note that the total shift\nin the peak position in the EDCs of (a) gives the size of\n\nFIG. 2: Simulated ARPES lineshapes (EDCs) in Bi2212 for\na series of photon energies (h\u03bd = 25 \u2212 25.7 eV) at a fixed\nkk = (0.34, 0.09)2\u03c0/a-point using three different values of the\nfinal state broadening given by the indicated imaginary parts\nof the self-energy, \u03a3\u2032\u2032f . In order to highlight the influence of\nkz -dispersion, the initial state broadening is chosen to be very\nsmall, \u03a3\u2032\u2032i = 0.2 meV.17\n\nthe kz -dispersion of the initial state. This should not be\nconfused with the change in h\u03bd needed to probe such a\nband. The change in h\u03bd is controlled by the final state\ndispersion, which is generally much larger than that of\nthe initial state.\nContinuing to the intermediate case of \u03a3\u2032\u2032f = 0.1 eV in\nFig. 2(b), the shift in the peak position from the bottom\nto the top of the initial state band is once again evident,\nbut the lineshapes are quite different, even though the\ninitial state damping \u03a3\u2032\u2032i in (b) is identical to that in\n(a). It is striking that some spectral intensity appears\nin (b) at all energies encompassed by the initial state\nband at every h\u03bd. This remarkable effect comes about\nbecause the energy uncertainty permitted by the width\nof the final state allows the photoelectron to couple with\ninitial states off-the-energy-shell. The lineshape thus develops a new component with an h\u03bd-independent width\nequal to the initial state bandwidth, which rides on top\nof the energy conserving peak in (a). Notice also how\nthe changes in the peak position could allow observing\ndifferent FSs as one maps different values of kz . Finally,\nfor the realistic final state width of \u03a3\u2032\u2032f = 1 eV in (c), the\ninitial state bandwidth component dominates the lineshape. The lineshape of the EDC curve is now virtually\nh\u03bd-independent. Despite the large final-state broadening, the energy spread of the EDC remains equal to the\ninitial state bandwidth in kz -direction because outside of\nthis interval, there are no initial state electrons capable\nof absorbing the photon.\nFig. 3 elaborates on these points by considering some\nof the results of Fig. 2 over a much broader range of photon energies. Fig. 3(a) presents the spectra of Fig. 2(b)\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 3: (Color) (a) Simulated ARPES intensities of Fig. 2(b)\nare depicted over a wide photon energy range of 19 \u2212 27 eV\nfor \u03a3\u2032\u2032f = 0.1 eV.

(b): Projection of the FS on to the\n(001)-plane, where the \"broadening\" of the FS reflects the\neffect of kz -dispersion.

Different colored\nbands here represent the same initial states being excited\nto different final states. Comparing Figs. 3(a) and 3(b),\nwe see that the peaks of Fig. 3(a) more or less follow the\nfinal state band structure of Fig. 3(b) [The agreement is\nnot expected to be perfect of course, since the initial state\ndispersion is not entirely negligible]. In Fig. 3(c), when a\nmore realistic final state width of \u03a3\u2032\u2032f = 1 eV is assumed,\nmuch of the structure is lost. The large variations in colors (or intensities) observed in Figs. 3(a) and 3(c) are the\nconsequence of the well-known kk and h\u03bd -dependency of\nthe ARPES matrix element.1,6,7,15,19\nThe preceding discussion of Figs. 2 and 3 makes it obvious that in a quasi-2D system, kz -dispersion leads to an\nirreducible linewidth in the ARPES spectra, which cannot be resolved by changing photon frequency. This effect\nwill also appear in the FS maps observed by measuring\nemission from EF in the (kx , ky )-plane. Fig. 4 illustrates\nhow this plays out. The standard bilayer split FS in the\nkz = 0 plane, given in Fig. 4(a), is the FS usually thought\nto be measured in ARPES. In Fig. 4(b) the full 3D FS\nhas been projected on to the (001)-plane by collecting\nindividual FS cuts corresponding to different kz values.\nThe kz -dispersion is now seen to introduce an effective\n\"broadening\" to the FS imprint. In a perfect 2D-system,\nthe maps in (b) and (a) would be identical. The effect of\nusing a finite energy window of \u00b130 meV around EF in\nthe computations is shown in Figs. 4(c) and 4(d). These\nsimulations indicate the influence of a finite experimental resolution on the results.13,20 Note that even with the\nwindow of \u00b130 meV in (d), the broadening effect of kz dispersion is not washed out. In fact, the broadening is\n\nsomewhat enhanced, especially near the antinodal point\ndue to the contribution of the flat bands related to the\nvan Hove singularity (VHS).\nIt is also interesting to consider changes in the\nlinewidth in momentum, \u2206k, as one moves away from\nthe Fermi level. In general, our simulations indicate that\n\u2206k increases with increasing binding energy (BE), due\nmainly to the flattening of bands and the concomitant\nreduction in the band velocity.4 In any event, the broadening as a function of BE is neither simply quadratic nor\nexponential. Furthermore, considering the the effect of\nvarying \u03a3\u2032\u2032i at a general kk -point, we have found that as\nthe initial state damping due to intrinsic scattering mechanisms (simulated via the value of \u03a3\u2032\u2032i ) decreases, the\nlinewidth \u2206E becomes increasingly dominated by the irreducible width associated with kz -dispersion. Along the\nantinodal direction this dispersion is negligible, and \u2206E\nand \u03a3\u2032\u2032i are related linearly.21\nWe return now to comment briefly on the bands of\nFigs. 1(a) and 1(b). Insight into how the complex kk - and\nkz -dependencies of these bands reflect intercell as well\nas intracell hopping effects can be gained by modeling\nthese bands within the TB framework. In the absence\nof intercell coupling, the conventional bilayer splitting\npossesses the form tbi = tz (cx \u2212 cy )2 , with ci = cos(ki a),\ni = x, y. The intercell coupling in the cuprates may\nbe included in the one-band model with dispersion22\n2\n\u01ebk = \u22122t(cx + cy ) \u2212 4t\u2032 cx cy \u2212 Tz (kk , sz )[(cx \u2212 cy ) /4 + a0 ],\nwhere sz = sin(kz c/4) and a0 = 0.6 corrects for the\nfinite bilayer splitting found at kk = 0. The form\nof Tz depends on the particular cuprate considered.\nWhile Ref. 22 lists seven inequivalent interlayer hopping\n\n\f4\nparameters, we find that we can describe the dispersion\nreasonably by including only the dominant contribution\nassociated withphopping between Cu 4s levels by introducing Tz = \u00b1 (tz \u2212 t\u2032z )2 + 4tz t\u2032z s2z , where plus (minus)\nsign refers to the bonding (antibonding) solution. tz is\na constant associated with intracell interlayer hoppings,\nand t\u2032z = 4t\u2032z0 cos(kx a/2)cos(ky a/2) accounts for intercell\nhopping. The extra angular dependence in this term\narises because for intercell hopping the two CuO2 -planes\nare offset, so that one Cu atom sits above an empty\ncell. Note that for t\u2032z = 0 one obtains the simple bilayer\nsplitting tbi with no kz -dispersion. TB bands of Fig. 1(c)\nassume (in eV): t = 0.42, t\u2032 = \u22120.12, tz = 0.125, and\nt\u2032z0 = 0.04. A comparison of the first principles and TB\nbands in Figs. 1(a) and 1(c), respectively, shows that our\nTB model reproduces the bilayer splitting, the collapse\nof the kz -dispersion around (\u03c0/a, 0), and the anomalous\ndispersions associated with level crossing to a reasonably\ngood degree, some minor discrepancies notwithstanding.\nWe emphasize that t\u2032z , which provides intercell coupling, is essential for obtaining coherent c-axis conductivity. t\u2032z thus controls the intrinsic resistivity anisotropy\nand gives a measure for discriminating between coherent and incoherent c-axis hopping.23 The lifetimes in the\ncuprates extracted from ARPES are considerably smaller\nthan optical lifetimes or those deduced from transport\nor tunneling measurements24 . A part of this difference\nmay be explained to be the result of an unresolved bilayer splitting25 . The remaining anomalous broadening\nis often interpreted26 in terms of small-angle scattering,\nwhich does not contribute to transport, but its origin remains obscure27 . The present analysis indicates that part\nof the broadening of ARPES lines has its origin in the kz dispersion, unrelated to any scattering mechanism.\nOur predicted effects of kz -dispersion on the\nlinewidths in Bi2212 should be resolvable with the\npower of currently available high resolution ARPES\ninstrumentation.28 The size of our novel line broadening\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n\n12\n\nA.

Notably, coherent 3D coupling has\nrecently been reported in a Tl cuprate29 . Additionally, a\nsimilar kz -induced broadening may be expected to have\nan impact on other experimental probes, such as Raman\nscattering30 .\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that residual kz dispersion in quasi-2D materials will induce an irreducible\nlinewidth in ARPES spectra. This intrinsic linewidth offers a new spectroscopic window for understanding inas well as out-of-plane scattering mechanisms and the\nnature of the 2D to 3D crossover in the cuprates. This\nhighly anisotropic line broadening mechanism, which has\nnot been recognized previously and is unrelated to 2D\nphysics, indicates that the existing analysis of stripe and\npseudogap physics based on ARPES spectra should be\nreexamined. Our study shows how ARPES can be extended to unravel the hidden third dimension of energy\nbands and Fermi surfaces in quasi-2D systems with wideranging consequences for understanding the nature of\nelectronic states in many novel materials.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work is supported by the US Department of Energy contract DE-AC03-76SF00098, and benefited from\nthe allocation of supercomputer time at NERSC, Northeastern University's Advanced Scientific Computation\nCenter (ASCC), and the Institute of Advanced Computing (IAC), Tampere.
