Despite\nthe fact that there are several approaches to treat the issue,\nthere is no final answer to the confinement problem. Let us\nbriefly point out the main ideas which will be the motivation\nof the present work.\n\nA. Dual superconductivity and confinement\n\nAn appealing mechanism to explain the color confinement\nis the so called dual superconductivity mechanism [1]. According to this proposal, the low energy regime of YM would\ncontain monopoles as vacuum configuration. The ensuing\nmagnetic condensation would induce a dual Meissner effect\nin the chromoelectric sector. As for ordinary superconducting\nmedia, the potential between chromoelectric charges increases\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: david.dudal@ugent.be; Postdoctoral fellow of the Special Research Fund of Ghent University.\n\u2020 Electronic address: marcio@dft.if.uerj.br\n\u2021 Electronic address: jag@amtp.liv.ac.uk\n\u00a7 Electronic address: vitor@dft.if.uerj.br\n\u00b6 Electronic address: sobreiro@dft.if.uerj.br\n\u2217\u2217 Electronic address:\nsorella@uerj.br; Work supported by FAPERJ,\nFunda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, under the program Cientista do Nosso Estado, E-26/151.947/2004.\n\u2020\u2020 Electronic address: thibes@dft.if.uerj.br\n\u2021\u2021 Electronic address: henri.verschelde@ugent.be\n\nlinearly with their length, characterizing a confinement picture.\nThe splitting between the diagonal and off-diagonal degrees\nof freedom in this approach [1, 2] indicates that the natural\nway to treat the problem would be to consider different gauge\nfixings for the diagonal and off-diagonal sectors of the theory. In fact, the class of Abelian gauges [2] shows itself to be\nthe suitable framework to work with. In this class of gauges\nnot only are the diagonal and off-diagonal sectors independently gauged, but also monopoles show up as defects in the\ngauge fixing. An interesting example of an Abelian gauge is\nthe maximal Abelian gauge (MAG) [2], which will be used in\nthis work and discussed in the next section.\n\nB. Abelian dominance and dynamical gluon mass\n\nAnother important ingredient of the infrared regime of\nQCD is the hypothesis of Abelian dominance [3]. This principle states that in the infrared limit, QCD would be described\nby an effective theory constructed from only Abelian degrees\nof freedom. This effect has been confirmed using lattice numerical simulations [4, 5].\nRecently, it has been argued that the off-diagonal gluon\nmight acquire a large dynamical mass in the MAG [6], with\nthe explicit SU(2) value of m \u2248 2.25\u039bQCD , due to the condensation of the off-diagonal gluon composite operator Aa\u03bc Aa\u03bc .\nThis can be regarded as evidence in favour of the Abelian\ndominance, since for an energy scale below this mass, the offdiagonal gluons should decouple and the diagonal degrees of\nfreedom would dominate the theory. At the same level, evidence of Abelian dominance has been advocated in the Landau gauge, due to the condensation of dimension two operators [7]. The Abelian degrees of freedom are identified here\n\n\f2\narises in the off-diagonal sector from the lattice data [15]. This\ncomponent is very well described by a Yukawa fit, (1), using\nthe same off-diagonal mass value. In the case of the diagonal\nsector, there is no longitudinal component of the propagator.\n\nwith the diagonal gluons.\nC.\n\nGribov ambiguities and the quantization of QCD\n\nIt is a fact that YM theories are plagued by Gribov ambiguities [8, 9], i.e., after the gauge fixing of the model, there\nstill remains a residual gauge symmetry spoiling a consistent\ncomplete quantization of QCD.\nThe improvement of the Faddeev-Popov quantization formula [8] in the Landau gauge, yields modifications of the\npropagators of the theory. The gluon propagator turns out to\nbe suppressed in the infrared limit, acquiring pure imaginary\npoles, indicating a destabilization of the gluon excitations. On\nthe other hand, the ghost propagator shows itself to be more\nsingular than the perturbative behavior, and can be related to\nthe existence of long range forces. Thus, one can tacitly infer that the Gribov problem is related to the confinement phenomenon. This is a strong motivation to study Gribov ambiguities in the MAG. However, concerning the Gribov problem in gauges other than the Landau and Coulomb ones, the\navailable information is very humble. To our knowledge, the\nonly available results are those obtained in the linear covariant\ngauges [10] and in the MAG [11, 12, 13]. The latter one will\nbe discussed here.\n\nThe final motivation for the present work is related to lattice numerical simulations, which provide a useful nonperturbative method to treat QCD. In the last decades the lattice has\nbeen used to extract nonperturbative effects of QCD. Mass\nparameters are commonly used to fit the lattice data with relative success. In particular, in the MAG, two mass scales have\nbeen employed to fit the data obtained for the diagonal and\noff-diagonal gluon propagators, yielding evidence in favour\nof the Abelian dominance [14, 15]. In [15], the off-diagonal\nmass has been found to be almost twice as big as compared\nto the diagonal one. Moreover, the most suitable fit for the\ntransverse off-diagonal gluon propagator is found to be of the\nYukawa type\n1\n,\nq2 + m2o f f\n\n(1)\n\nwhile for the diagonal sector, the best fit of the transverse\npropagator is given by a Gribov type formula\nDdiag (q) =\n\nq2\n,\nq4 + m4diag\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\nmo f f \u2248 2mdiag .\n\nThe above considerations are sufficient to justify the study\nof the MAG. Here, we shall summarize the analytic results\nobtained in [13], concerning the effects of the Gribov ambiguities and of the dynamical mass generation on the propagators\nof the theory, in the case of SU(2) MAG.\nThe original Gribov approach, [8], can be essentially repeated in the case of the MAG, where the effect of the dynamical off-diagonal gluon mass [6] can also be taken into\naccount. The resulting behavior of the propagators is as follows. The transverse off-diagonal gluon propagator is of the\nYukawa type\nDo f f (q) =\n\n(3)\n\nThe numerical value of the off-diagonal mass is, in both works\n[14, 15], mo f f \u2248 1.2GeV . Both propagators are suppressed\nin the infrared limit. In addition, a longitudinal component\n\n1\nq 2 + m2\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere m is the dynamical mass generated due to the condensation of the off-diagonal gluon operator Aa\u03bc Aa\u03bc . The diagonal\npropagator is purely transverse, being given by\nDdiag (q) =\n\nD. Lattice data\n\nDo f f (q) =\n\nE. Analytic results\n\nq2\n,\nq4 + \u03b34\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the so called Gribov parameter, with the dimension\nof a mass. Further, the off-diagonal ghost propagator turns out\nto be enhanced in the low energy region, according to\nlim G(q) \u221d\n\nq\u21920\n\n1\n.\nq4\n\n(6)\n\nTo our knowledge this is the first result on the ghost propagator in the MAG when the Gribov ambiguities are taken into\naccount.\nThese results might provide some physical insights on the\nnature of the mass parameters appearing in the lattice fits.\nHere, one can easily see from (4) and (5) that the Gribov ambiguities are responsible for the infrared suppression of the\ndiagonal sector, while the dynamical mass enters only the offdiagonal sector, making it also suppressed in the infrared.\nDespite the fact that the propagators (4) and (5) are in qualitative agreement with the lattice data (1) and (2), see [15], we\nwere not able to provide specific values for \u03b3 and m due to the\nlack of a more formal framework to work with. Such a framework is currently only at hand in the Landau gauge where a local, renormalizable Lagrangian, which takes into account the\nGribov ambiguities, is known [16]. In [17, 18, 19], this Lagrangian was used to make explicit computations. In the case\nof the MAG, such a Lagrangian was recently derived [20], but\nno explicit computations have been performed yet. Moreover,\nit will allow us to investigate the behavior of the longitudinal component of the off-diagonal gluon propagator, a feature\nwhich we were unable to address within the approximation\nemployed in [13].\n\n\f3\nII.\n\nB. The Gribov problem in the MAG\n\nGRIBOV AMBIGUITIES IN THE MAG\n\nFirst, we shall present the MAG in the case of SU(2) YangMills. Then, the Gribov ambiguities will be introduced and\ntheir main features will be briefly discussed.\nA.

The MAG gauge fixing condition is attained by requiring that\nb\nDab\n\u03bc A\u03bc = 0 .\n\n(13)\n\nThe residual local U(1) gauge symmetry present in the diagonal sector is fixed by means of the Landau gauge\n\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc = 0 .\n\n(14)\n\nAccording to [13], the gauge fixing conditions (13), (14) yield\nthe following partition function\nZ\n\u0011\n\u0010\nb\n\u2212SY M\n, (15)\nZ = DAa DA det M ab \u03b4(Dab\n\u03bc A\u03bc )\u03b4(\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc )e\nwhere M ab is the off-diagonal Hermitian Faddeev-Popov\nghost operator\ncb\n2 ac bd c d\nM ab = \u2212Dac\n\u03bc D\u03bc \u2212 g \u03b5 \u03b5 A \u03bc A \u03bc .\n\n1\n\u2202\u03bc (Aa\u03bc \u03c9b ) .\n\u22022\n\n(20)\n\nAs expected, this observation allows us to prove that the diagonal ghosts decouple, and can be in fact integrated out in the\npartition function (15). Thus, one can focus only on the zero\nmodes of the off-diagonal Faddeev-Popov operator, eq.(18).\n\n(11)\n\nThe action (9) is invariant under the gauge transformations\n\u03b4Aa\u03bc\n\n(18)\n(19)\n\nimplying the existence of zero modes for the Faddeev-Popov\noperator M ab . Thus, the Yang-Mills measure in the partition\nfunction (15) is ill-defined. Also, from eq.(19), one observes\nthat the diagonal parameter \u03c9 is completely determined once\neq.(18) has been solved for \u03c9a , according to\n\nExplicitly, for the components of the field strength we have\na\nF\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(17)\n\n(7)\n\nwhere T a , a = 1, 2, stands for the off-diagonal generators of\nSU(2), while T 3 denotes the diagonal one. In the same way\nthe field strength decomposes as\na a\nF\u03bc\u03bd = F\u03bc\u03bd\nT + F\u03bc\u03bd T 3 ,\n\nThe existence of a residual gauge symmetry in the path integral (15) is recognized as the well known Gribov problem\n[8]. It consists in the existence of equivalent gauge field conea\u03bc , A\ne\u03bc }, obeying the gauge conditions (13) and\nfigurations, {A\n(14), namely\n\n(16)\n\nC. Facing the Gribov copies\n\nAccording to [13], the existence of the Gribov copies in the\nMAG can be faced along the lines outlined by Gribov in the\ncase of the Landau and Coulomb gauges [8], where the domain of integration in the Feynman path integral is restricted\nto a smaller region \u03a9, known as the Gribov region.\nIn the case of the MAG, the region \u03a9 is identified with the\nset of field configurations obeying the gauge conditions (13)\nand (14), and for which the Faddeev-Popov operator, eq.(16),\nis strictly positive, namely\no\nn\nb\nab\n>0 .\n(21)\n\u03a9 \u2261 A\u03bc Dab\n\u03bc A\u03bc = 0 , \u2202\u03bc A\u03bc = 0 , M\nThe boundary \u2202\u03a9 of the region \u03a9 is known as the Gribov horizon. In the MAG, the restriction of the domain of integration\nin the path integral to the region \u03a9 is supported by the fact\nthat for a field configuration belonging to \u03a9 and lying near\nthe Gribov horizon \u2202\u03a9, there is an equivalent configuration\nlocated on the other side of the horizon \u2202\u03a9, outside of the\nGribov region \u03a9. This result is a generalization to the MAG\nof Gribov's original statement in the Landau gauge. The complete proof can be found in [13]. The restriction to the region\n\u03a9 is achieved by modifying the partition function (15) in such\n\n\f4\na way that\n\nZ=\n\nZ\n\nIII.\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\nb\n\u2212SY M\nV (\u03a9) ,\nDAa DA det M ab \u03b4(Dab\n\u03bc A\u03bc )\u03b4(\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc )e\n\n(22)\nwhere the functional V (\u03a9) implements the restriction to \u03a9 in\nfield space.\nThe functional V (\u03a9) can be constructed recursively by\nmeans of a no-pole condition on the off-diagonal ghost propagator, which is nothing else but the inverse of the operator\nM ab . In fact, from the definition of the region \u03a9, it follows\nthat the inverse of the Faddeev-Popov operator, (M ab )\u22121 , see\n[8, 13], has to be positive and without singularities, except\nfor those configurations which are located on the boundary\n\u2202\u03a9, where M ab vanishes. Moving to momentum space, it\ncan be shown that the Green function G (k) = k M \u22121 k\nhas no poles at nonvanishing k2 , except for a singularity at\nk2 = 0, corresponding in fact to the boundary \u2202\u03a9.

In [6], the condensation of the operator Aa\u03bc Aa\u03bc was analysed in detail in the MAG,\nby evaluating the effective potential for this operator at one\nloop order. It was shown that this potential develops a nontrivial minimum, which lowers the vacuum energy, favoring\nthus the formation of the condensate Aa\u03bc Aa\u03bc , which results\nin an effective dynamical off-diagonal gluon mass. Following [6], the dynamical mass generation can be described by\nadding to the Yang-Mills action the following term\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n1\ng2 a a \u00012\n4\n2\na a\nSm =\n,\n(26)\nA\u03bc A\u03bc\nd x \u03c3 + g\u03c3A\u03bcA\u03bc +\n2\u03b6g2\n4\nwhere \u03c3 is a Hubbard-Stratanovich auxiliary field coupled to\nthe composite operator Aa\u03bc Aa\u03bc . As shown in [6], the field \u03c3\ndevelops a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value, h\u03c3i 6= 0,\nwhich is related to the gluon condensate Aa\u03bc Aa\u03bc through the\nrelation [6]\n\n(23)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the Gribov parameter. It is not a free parameter,\nbeing determined by the gap equation\n3 2\ng\n4\n\nDYNAMICAL MASS IN THE MAG\n\n(24)\n\nThe gap equation (24), together with the path integral (22)\nensures the correct truncation of the integration domain up to\nthe Gribov horizon.\n\nh\u03c3i = \u2212\n\ng a a\nA A .\n2 \u03bc \u03bc\n\nThe parameter \u03b6 is needed to account for the vacuum divergences present in the Green function A2 (x)A2 (y) . At one\nloop order, for the dynamical gluon mass m one finds [6]\nm2 =\n\nAa\u03bc Aa\u03bc\n\u2248 (2.25\u039bQCD )2 ,\ng\u03b6\n\nThe restriction of the domain of integration, eq.(22), has\nfar reaching consequences on the behavior of the propagators.\nLooking at the form of the functional (23), one can easily see\nthat it affects only the diagonal tree level propagator. In fact,\nthe diagonal propagator is given by (5), which is infrared suppressed. We notice the appearance of imaginary poles in this\npropagator, indicating that the diagonal gluon does not belong\nto the physical spectrum of the model. This behavior is consistent with the confining character of the theory.\nConcerning the off-diagonal gluon propagator, it is left unmodified at the tree level, coinciding with the transverse perturbative propagator\npert\n\nDo f f =\n\n1\n.\nq2\n\n(25)\n\nThere is no longitudinal off-diagonal component at the tree\nlevel.\nThe off-diagonal ghost propagator shows itself to be more\nsingular in the infrared region, as can be inferred from (6). We\nremark that the gap equation (24) is an essential ingredient for\nthis behavior. Notice also that this enhancement is a manifestation of the Gribov horizon, where the ghost propagator is\nhighly singular.\n\n(28)\n\nRemarkably, the effective action\nS = SY M + Sm ,\n\nD. Propagators I\n\n(27)\n\n(29)\n\nturns out to be gauge invariant, provided the auxiliary field \u03c3\ntransforms as\nb\n\u03b4\u03c3 = gAa\u03bc Dab\n\u03bc \u03c9 .\n\n(30)\n\nAs a consequence, the action (29) is still plagued by the Gribov ambiguities. In order to cure this pathology, one can perform the same procedure as was performed for the massless\ncase. According to [13], both the functional (23) and the gap\nequation (24) remain the same.\nA.\n\nPropagators II\n\nSince the functional (23) depends only on the diagonal\ngluon field, the corresponding propagator is not affected, at\nthe tree level, by the dynamical mass. Thus, the diagonal\ngluon propagator is given by (5).\nThe off-diagonal gluon propagator is, however, affected by\nthe dynamical mass. A simple computation leads to the expression (4), exhibiting infrared suppression due to the dynamical mass. .\nThe ghost propagator, also not affected by the gluon mass,\nshows the typical infrared enhancement (6). Again, the gap\nequation (24) is fundamental for this result.\n\n\f5\nIV. CONCLUSIONS AND MORE\n\nIn this work we have reviewed the influence of the Gribov\nambiguities and of the dynamical gluon mass on the propagators of SU(2) Yang-Mills theories in four-dimensional Euclidean space time, quantized in the maximal Abelian gauge.\nThe diagonal as well as the off-diagonal gluon propagators are\ninfrared suppressed. The diagonal sector displays a Gribov\ntype behavior, due to the presence of the Gribov parameter,\nsee (5). The off-diagonal gluon propagator has a Yukawa type\nbehavior, see (4).\nThe off-diagonal ghost propagator was computed in the infrared limit. The result (6) shows that it is enhanced in the\nlow energy region. To some extent, this enhancement signals\nthe influence of field configurations located near the boundary\n\u2202\u03a9 of the Gribov region, where the ghost propagator is highly\nsingular [8, 24].\nWe recall here that, for the gluon propagators, our results\n\n[1] Y.
