Let w(t) = (w1 (t), ..., wd (t))T be a d-dimensional Brownian motion defined on the probability\nspace, where T denotes the transpose of a vector or a matrix. In this paper we study the numerical\napproximation of the stochastic differential equations (SDEs)\ndx(t) = f (x(t))dt + g(x(t))dw(t).\n\n(1.1)\n\nHere x(t) \u2208 Rn for each t \u2265 0 and f : Rn \u2192 Rn and g : Rn \u2192 Rn\u00d7d . For simplicity we assume that\nx0 \u2208 Rn is a deterministic vector. Although the method of Lyapunov functions allows us to show that\nthere are solutions to a very wide family of SDEs (see e.g. [24, 34]), in general, both the explicit solutions\nand the probability distributions of the solutions are not known. We therefore consider computable\n\u2217 Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, G1 1XH, Scotland,\n(x.mao@strath.ac.uk).\n\u2020 Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX1 3LB, UK (lukas.szpruch@maths.ox.ac.uk).\n\nUK\n\n\fdiscrete approximations that, for example, could be used in Monte Carlo simulations. Convergence and\nstability of these methods are well understood for SDEs with Lipschitz continuous coefficients: see [26]\nfor example. Our primary objective is to study classical strong convergence and stability questions for\nnumerical approximations in the case where f and g are not globally Lipschitz continuous. A good\nmotivation for our work is an instructive conditional result of Higham et al. [18]. Under the local\nLipschitz condition, they proved that uniform boundedness of moments of both the solution to (1.1)\nand its approximation are sufficient for strong convergence. That immediately raises the question of\nwhat type of conditions can guarantee such a uniform boundedness of moments. It is well known that\nthe classical linear growth condition is sufficient to bound the moments for both the true solutions and\ntheir EM approximation [26, 34]. It is also known that when we try to bound the moment of the true\nsolutions, a useful way to relax the linear growth condition is to apply the Lyapunov-function technique,\nwith V (x) = kxk2 . This leads us to the monotone condition [34]. More precisely, if there exist constants\n\u03b1, \u03b2 > 0 such that the coefficients of equation (1.1) satisfy\n1\nhx, f (x)i + kg(x)k2 \u2264 \u03b1 + \u03b2kxk2\n2\n\nfor all x \u2208 Rn ,\n\n(1.2)\n\nthen\nsup Ekx(t)k2 < \u221e \u2200T > 0.\n\n(1.3)\n\n0\u2264t\u2264T\n\nHere, and throughout, kxk denotes both the Euclidean vector norm and the Frobenius matrix norm and\nhx, yi denotes the scalar product of vectors x, y \u2208 Rn . However, to the best of our knowledge there is no\nresult on the moment bound for the numerical solutions of SDEs under the monotone condition (1.2).\nAdditionally, Hutzenthaler et al. [23] proved that in the case of super-linearly growing coefficients, the\nEM approximation may not converge in the strong Lp -sense nor in the weak sense to the exact solution.\nFor example, let us consider a non-linear SDE\ndx(t) = (\u03bc \u2212 \u03b1x(t)3 )dt + \u03b2x(t)2 dw(t),\n\n(1.4)\n\nwhere \u03bc, \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2265 0 and \u03b1 > 12 \u03b2 2 . In order to approximate SDE (1.4) numerically, for any \u2206t, we define\nthe partition P\u2206t := {tk = k\u2206t : k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , N } of the time interval [0, T ], where N \u2206t = T and\nT > 0. Then we define the EM approximation Ytk \u2248 x(tk ) of (1.4) by\nYtk+1 = Ytk + (\u03bc \u2212 \u03b1Yt3k )\u2206t + \u03b2Yt2k \u2206wtk ,\n\n(1.5)\n\nwhere \u2206wtk = w(tk+1 ) \u2212 w(tk ). It was shown in [23] that\nlim EkYtN k2 = \u221e.\n\n\u2206t\u21920\n\nOn the other hand, the coefficients of (1.4) satisfy the monotone condition (1.2) so (1.3) holds. Hence,\nHutzenthaler et al. [23] concluded that\nlim Ekx(T ) \u2212 YtN k2 = \u221e.\n\n\u2206t\u21920\n\nIt is now clear that to prove the strong convergence theorem under condition (1.2) it is necessary to\nmodify the EM scheme. Motivated by the existing works [18] and [21] we consider implicit schemes.\nThese authors have demonstrated that a backward Euler-Maruyama (BEM) method strongly converges\nto the solution of the SDE with one-sided Lipschitz drift and linearly growing diffusion coefficients. So\nfar, to the best of our knowledge, most of the existing results on the strong convergence for numerical\nschemes only cover SDEs where the diffusion coefficients have at most linear growth [5, 39, 17, 22, 26].\nHowever, the problem remains essentially unsolved for the important class of SDEs with super-linearly\ngrowing diffusion coefficients. We are interested in relaxing the conditions for the diffusion coefficients\nto justify Monte Carlo simulations for highly non-linear systems that arise in financial mathematics,\n[1, 8, 2, 9, 14, 29], for example\ndx(t) = (\u03bc \u2212 \u03b1xr (t))dt + \u03b2x\u03c1 (t)dw(t),\n2\n\nr, \u03c1 > 1,\n\n(1.6)\n\n\fwhere \u03bc, \u03b1, \u03b2 > 0, or in stochastic population dynamics [35, 3, 36, 41, 11], for example\ndx(t) = diag(x1 (t), x2 (t), ..., xn (t))[(b + Ax2 (t))dt + x(t)dw(t)],\n\n(1.7)\n\nwhere b = (b1 , . . . , bn )T , x2 (t) = (x21 (t), . . . , x2 (t)n )T and matrix A = [aij ]1\u2264i,j\u2264n is such that \u03bbmax (A +\nAT ) < 0, where \u03bbmax (A) = supx\u2208Rn ,kxk=1 xT Ax. The only results we know, where the strong convergence\nof the numerical approximations was considered for super-linear diffusion, is Szpruch et al. [43] and Mao\nand Szpruch [37]. In [43] authors have considered the BEM approximation for the following scalar SDE\nwhich arises in finance [2],\ndx(t) = (\u03b1\u22121 x(t)\u22121 \u2212 \u03b10 + \u03b11 x(t) \u2212 \u03b12 x(t)r )dt + \u03c3x(t)\u03c1 dw(t)\n\nr, \u03c1 > 1.\n\nIn [37], this analysis was extended to the multidimensional case under specific conditions for the drift and\ndiffusion coefficients. In the present paper, we aim to prove strong convergence under general monotone\ncondition (1.2) in a multidimensional setting. We believe that this condition is optimal for boundedness\nof moments of the implicit schemes. The reasons that we are interested in the strong convergence are:\na) the efficient variance reduction techniques, for example, the multi-level Monte Carlo simulations [12],\nrely on the strong convergence properties; b) both weak convergence [26] and pathwise convergence [25]\nfollow automatically.\nHaving established the strong convergence result we will proceed to the stability analysis of the underlying numerical scheme for the non-linear SDEs (1.1) under the monotone-type condition. The main\nproblem concerns the propagation of an error during the simulation of an approximate path. If the\nnumerical scheme is not stable, then the simulated path may diverge substantially from the exact solution in practical simulations. Similarly, the expectation of the functional estimated by a Monte Carlo\nsimulation may be significantly different from that of the expected functional of the underlying SDEs\ndue to numerical instability. Our aim here is to investigate almost surely asymptotic properties of the\nnumerical schemes for SDEs (1.1) via a stochastic version of the LaSalle principle. LaSalle, [27], improved\nsignificantly the Lyapunov stability method for ordinary differential equations. Namely, he developed\nmethods for locating limit sets of nonautonomous systems [13, 27]. The first stochastic counterpart of\nhis great achievement was established by Mao [33] under the local Lipschitz and linear growth conditions. Recently, this stochastic version was generalized by Shen et al. [42] to cover stochastic functional\ndifferential equations with locally Lipschitz continuous coefficients. Furthermore, it is well known that\nthere exists a counterpart of the invariance principle for discrete dynamical systems [28]. However, there\nis no discrete stochastic counterpart of Mao's version of the LaSalle theorem. In this work we investigate\na special case, with the Lyapunov function V (x) = kxk2 , of the LaSalle theorem. We shall show that\nthe almost sure global stability can be easily deduced from our results. The primary objectives in our\nstability analysis are:\n\u2022 Ability to cover highly nonlinear SDEs;\n\u2022 Mild assumption on the time step - A(\u03b1)-stability concept [15].\nResults which investigate stability analysis for numerical methods can be found in Higham [16, 15] for\nthe scalar linear case, Baker et al. [4] for the global Lipschitz and Higham et al. [19] for one-sided\nLipschitz and the linear growth condition.\nAt this point, it is worth mentioning how our work compares with that of Higham et al. [18]. Theorem\n3.3 in their paper is a very important contribution to the numerical SDE theory. The authors proved\nstrong convergence results for one-sided Lipschitz and the linear growth condition on drift and diffusion\ncoefficients, respectively. What differentiates our work from [18] are: a) We significantly relax the\nlinear growth constraint on the diffusion coefficient and we only ask for very general monotone type\ngrowth; b) Our analysis is based on a more widely applied BEM scheme in contrast to the split-step\nscheme introduced in their paper. An interesting alternative to the implicit schemes for numerical\napproximations of SDEs with non-globally Lipschitz drift coefficient recently appeared in [22]. However\nthe stability properties of this method are not analysed.\nIn what follows, for notational simplicity, we use the convention that C represent a generic positive\nconstant independent of \u2206t, the value of which may be different for different appearances.\n\n3\n\n\fThe rest of the paper is arranged as follows. In section 2, we introduce the monotone condition under\nwhich we prove the existence of a unique solution to equation (1.1), along with appropriate bounds that\nwill be needed in further analysis. In Section 3 we propose the \u03b8-EM scheme, which is known as the BEM\nwhen \u03b8 = 1, to approximate the solution of equation (1.1). We show that the 2nd moment of the \u03b8-EM,\ncan be bounded under the monotone condition plus some mild assumptions on f and g. In Section 4 we\nintroduce a new numerical method, which we call the forward-backward Euler-Maruyama (FBEM). The\nFBEM scheme enables us to overcome some measurability difficulties and avoid using Malliavin calculus.\nWe demonstrate that both the FBEM and the \u03b8-EM do not differ much in the Lp -sense. Then we prove\na strong convergence theorem on a compact domain that is later extended to the whole domain. We also\nperform a numerical experiment that confirms our theoretical results. Section 5 contains the stability\nanalysis, where we prove a special case of the stochastic LaSalle theorem for discrete time processes.\n\n2\n\nExistence and Uniqueness of Solution\n\nWe require the coefficients f and g in (1.1) to be locally Lipschitz continuous and to satisfy the monotone\ncondition, that is\nAssumption 2.1. Both coefficients f and g in (1.1) satisfy the following conditions:\nLocal Lipschitz condition. For each integer m \u2265 1, there is a positive constant C(m) such that\nkf (x) \u2212 f (y)k + kg(x) \u2212 g(y)k \u2264 C(m)kx \u2212 yk\nfor those x, y \u2208 Rn with kxk \u2228 kyk \u2264 m.\n\nMonotone condition. There exist constants \u03b1 and \u03b2 such that\n1\nhx, f (x)i + kg(x)k2 \u2264 \u03b1 + \u03b2kxk2\n2\n\n(2.1)\n\nfor all x \u2208 Rn .\nIt is a classical result that under Assumption 2.1, there exists a unique solution to (1.1) for any given\ninitial value x(0) = x0 \u2208 Rn , [10, 34]. The reason why we present the following theorem with a proof here\nis that it reveals the upper bound for the probability that the process x(t) stays on a compact domain\nfor finite time T > 0. The bound will be used to derive the main convergence theorem of this paper.\nTheorem 2.2. Let Assumption 2.1 hold. Then for any given initial value x(0) = x0 \u2208 Rn , there exists\n\na unique, global solution {x(t)}t\u22650 to equation (1.1). Moreover, the solution has the properties that for\n\nany T > 0,\n\nEkx(T )k2 < (kx0 k2 + 2\u03b1T ) exp(2\u03b2T ),\nand\nP(\u03c4m \u2264 T ) \u2264\n\n(kx0 k2 + 2\u03b1T ) exp(2\u03b2T )\n,\nm2\n\n(2.2)\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere m is any positive integer and\n\u03c4m = inf{t \u2265 0 :\n\nkx(t)k > m}.\n\n(2.4)\n\nProof. It is well known that under Assumption 2.1, for any given initial value x0 \u2208 Rn there exists a\n\nunique solution x(t) to the SDE (1.1), [?, 34]. Therefore we only need to prove that (2.2) and (2.3) hold.\n\n4\n\n\fApplying the It\u00f4 formula to the function V (x, t) = kxk2 , we compute the diffusion operator\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\nLV (x, t) = 2 hx, f (x)i + kg(x)k2 .\n2\nBy Assumption 2.1\nLV (x, t) \u2264 2\u03b1 + 2\u03b2kxk2 .\nTherefore\nEkx(t \u2227 \u03c4m )k2 \u2264 kx0 k2 + 2\u03b1T +\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nt\n\n(2.5)\n\n2\u03b2Ekx(s \u2227 \u03c4m )k2 ds.\n\nThe Gronwall inequality gives\nEkx(T \u2227 \u03c4m )k2 \u2264 (kx0 k2 + 2\u03b1T ) exp(2\u03b2T ).\n\n(2.6)\n\nHence\nP(\u03c4m \u2264 T )m2 \u2264 [kx0 k2 + 2\u03b1T ] exp(2\u03b2T ).\nNext, letting m \u2192 \u221e in (2.6) and applying Fatou's lemma, we obtain\nEkx(T )k2 \u2264 [kx0 k2 + 2\u03b1T ] exp(2\u03b2T ),\nwhich gives the other assertion (2.2) and completes the proof.\n\n3\n\nThe \u03b8-Euler-Maruyama Scheme\n\nAs indicated in the introduction, in order to approximate the solution of (1.1) we will use the \u03b8-EM\nscheme. Given any step size \u2206t, we define a partition P\u2206t := {tk = k\u2206t : k = 0, 1, 2, ...} of the half line\n[0, \u221e), and define\nXtk+1 = Xtk + \u03b8f (Xtk+1 )\u2206t + (1 \u2212 \u03b8)f (Xtk )\u2206t + g(Xtk )\u2206wtk ,\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere \u2206wtk = wtk+1 \u2212 wtk and Xt0 = x0 . The additional parameter \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 1] allows us to control the\nimplicitness of the numerical scheme, that may lead to various asymptotic behaviours of equation (3.1).\nFor technical reasons we always require \u03b8 \u2265 0.5.\nSince we are dealing with an implicit scheme we need to make sure that equation (3.1) has a unique\nsolution Xtk+1 given Xtk . To prove this, in addition to Assumption 2.1, we ask that function f satisfies\nthe one-sided Lipschitz condition.\nAssumption 3.1. One-sided Lipschitz condition. There exists a constant L > 0 such that\nhx \u2212 y, f (x) \u2212 f (y)i \u2264 Lkx \u2212 yk2\n\n\u2200x, y \u2208 Rn .\n\nIt follows from the fixed point theorem that a unique solution Xtk+1 to equation (3.1) exists given Xtk ,\n1\n1\nprovided \u2206t < \u03b8L\n, (see [37] for more details). From now on we always assume that \u2206t < \u03b8L\n. In order\nn\nn\nto implement numerical scheme (3.1) we define a function F : R \u2192 R as\nF (x) = x \u2212 \u03b8f (x)\u2206t.\n\n(3.2)\n\nDue to Assumption 3.1, there exists an inverse function F \u22121 and the solution to (3.1) can be represented\n5\n\n\fin the following form\nXtk+1 = F \u22121 (Xtk + (1 \u2212 \u03b8)f (Xtk )\u2206t + g(Xtk )\u2206wtk ).\nClearly, Xtk is Ftk -measurable. In many applications, the drift coefficient of the SDEs has a cubic or\nquadratic form, whence the inverse function can be found explicitly. For more complicated SDEs we can\nfind the inverse function F \u22121 using root-finding algorithms, such as Newton's method.\n\n3.1\n\nMoment Properties of \u03b8-EM\n\nIn this section we show that the second moment of the \u03b8-EM (3.1) is bounded (Theorem 3.6). To achieve\nthe bound we employ the stopping time technique, in a similar way as in the proof of Theorem 2.2.\nHowever, in discrete time approximations for a stochastic process, the problem of overshooting the level\nwhere we would like to stop the process appears, [7, 6, 32].\nDue to the implicitness of scheme (3.1), an additional but mild restriction on the time step appears.\nThat is, from now on, we require \u2206t \u2264 \u2206t\u2217 , where \u2206t\u2217 \u2208 (0, (max{L, 2\u03b2}\u03b8)\u22121 ) with \u03b2 and L defined in\nAssumptions 2.1 and 3.1, respectively.\nThe following lemma shows that in order to guarantee the boundedness of moments for Xtk defined by\n(3.1) it is enough to bound the moments of F (Xtk ), where F is defined by (3.2).\nLemma 3.2. Let Assumption 2.1 hold. Then for F (x) = x \u2212 \u03b8f (x)\u2206t we have\n\u0002\n\u0003\nkxk2 \u2264 (1 \u2212 2\u03b2\u03b8\u2206t)\u22121 kF (x)k2 + 2\u03b8\u03b1\u2206t\n\n\u2200x \u2208 Rn .\n\nProof. Writing kF (x)k2 = hF (x), F (x)i and using Assumption 2.1 we arrive at\nkF (x)k2 =kxk2 \u2212 2\u03b8hx, f (x)i\u2206t + \u03b82 kf (x)k2 \u2206t2\n\u2265(1 \u2212 2\u03b2\u03b8\u2206t)kxk2 \u2212 2\u03b8\u03b1\u2206t,\n\nand the assertion follows.\nWe define the stopping time \u03bbm by\n\u03bbm = inf{k : kXtk k > m}.\n\n(3.3)\n\nWe observe that when k \u2208 [0, \u03bbm (\u03c9)], kXtk\u22121 (\u03c9)k \u2264 m, but we may have kXtk (\u03c9)k > m, so the following\nlemma is not trivial.\nLemma 3.3. Let Assumptions 2.1, 3.1 hold, and \u03b8 \u2265 0, 5. Then for p \u2265 2 and sufficiently large integer\nm, there exists a constant C(p, m), such that\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nE kXtk kp 1[0,\u03bbm ] (k) < C(p, m)\n\nfor any k \u2265 0.\n\nProof. The proof is given in the Appendix.\nFor completeness of the exposition we recall the discrete Gronwall inequality, that we will use in the\nproof of Theorem 3.6.\n\n6\n\n\fLemma 3.4 (The Discrete Gronwall Inequality).

[38]. To prove the boundedness of the second moment for the\n\u03b8-EM (3.1), we need an additional but mild assumption on the coefficients f and g.\nAssumption 3.5. The coefficients of equation (1.1) satisfy the polynomial growth condition. That is,\nthere exists a pair of constants h \u2265 1 and C(h) > 0 such that\nkf (x)k \u2228 kg(x)k \u2264 C(h)(1 + kxkh ),\n\n\u2200x \u2208 Rn .\n\n(3.4)\n\nLet us begin to establish the fundamental result of this paper that reveals the boundedness of the second\nmoments for SDEs (1.1) under Assumptions 2.1 and 3.5.\nTheorem 3.6. Let Assumptions 2.1, 3.1, 3.5 hold, and \u03b8 \u2265 0.5. Then, for any T > 0, there exists a\n\nconstant C(T ) > 0, such that the \u03b8-EM scheme (3.1) has the following property\nsup\n\nsup EkXtk k2 < C(T ).\n\n\u2206t\u2264\u2206t\u2217 0\u2264tk \u2264T\n\nProof.

For example, lets consider equation (1.4) with\n\u03bc(x) = a + sin(x)2 , a > 0, that is\ndx(t) = (a + sin(x)2 \u2212 \u03b1x(t)3 )dt + \u03b2x(t)2 dw(t),\n\n(4.7)\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2 > 0. This type of SDE could be used to model electricity prices where we need to account for\na seasonality pattern, [31]. In this situation, it is useful to split the drift coefficient in two parts, that is\nf (x) = f1 (x) + f2 (x).\n\n(4.8)\n\nThis allows us to introduce partial implicitness in the numerical scheme. In the case of (4.7) we would\ntake f1 (x) = \u2212\u03b1x(t)3 and f2 (x) = a + sin(x)2 . Then a new partially implicit \u03b8-EM scheme has the\nfollowing form\nYtk+1 = Ytk + \u03b8f1 (Ytk+1 )\u2206t + (1 \u2212 \u03b8)f1 (Ytk )\u2206t + f2 (Ytk )\u2206t + g(Ytk )\u2206wtk .\n\n(4.9)\n\nIt is enough that f1 satisfies Assumption 3.1 in order for scheme (4.9) to be well defined.

Let Assumption 3.5 hold and \u2206t \u2208 [0, (max{L, 2\u03b2}\u03b8)\u22121 ).

In order to prove Theorem 4.5 we need to show that results from sections 3 and 4, proved for (3.1),\nhold for (4.9) under modified assumptions. The only significant difference is in the proof of Theorem\n3.6 for (4.9). Due to condition (4.11) we can show that Lemma 3.2 holds for function H. Then by the\ndefinition of function H in (4.10), we can represent the \u03b8-EM scheme (4.9) as\nH(Ytk+1 ) = H(Ytk ) + f (Ytk )\u2206t + g(Ytk )\u2206wtk .\nConsequently writing hH(Ytk+1 ), H(Ytk+1 )i = kH(Ytk+1 )k2 we obtain\nkH(Ytk+1 )k2 = kH(Ytk )k2 + kf (Ytk )k2 \u2206t2 + kg(Ytk )k2 \u2206t\n\n(4.14)\n\n+ 2hH(Ytk ), f (Ytk )i\u2206t + \u2206Mtk+1\n\nwhere\n\n\u0001\n= kH(Ytk )k2 + 2hYtk , f (Ytk )i + kg(Ytk )k2 \u2206t\n\u0003\n\u0002\n+ 2(1 \u2212 \u03b8)hf1 (Ytk ), f2 (Ytk )i + kf2 (Ytk )k2 + (1 \u2212 2\u03b8)kf1 (Ytk )k2 \u2206t2 + \u2206Mtk+1 ,\n\n\u2206Mtk+1 = kg(Ytk )\u2206wtk+1 k2 \u2212 kg(Ytk )k2 \u2206t + 2hH(Ytk ), g(Ytk )\u2206wtk+1 i\n+ 2hf (Ytk )\u2206t, g(Ytk )\u2206wtk+1 i.\nDue to condition (4.12) we have\nkH(Ytk+1 )k2 \u2264 kH(Ytk )k2 + 2\u03b1\u2206t + 2\u03b2 kYtk k2 + \u2206Mtk+1 .\nThe proof can be completed by analogy to the analysis for the \u03b8-EM scheme (3.1). Having boundedness\nof moments for (4.9) we can show that (4.13) holds in exactly the same way as for \u03b8-EM scheme (3.1).\n\n4.3\n\nNumerical Example\n\nIn this section we perform a numerical experiment that confirms our theoretical results. Since Multilevel\nMonte-Carlo simulations provide excellent motivation for our work [12], here we consider the measure\nof error (4.13) with s = 2. Although, the case s = 2 is not covered by our analysis, the numerical\n\n12\n\n\fexperiment suggests that Theorem 4.4 still holds. In our numerical experiment, we focus on the error at\nthe endpoint T = 1, so we let\nestrong\n= Ekx(T ) \u2212 XT k2 .\n\u2206t\nWe consider the SDE (1.4)\ndx(t) = (\u03bc \u2212 \u03b1x(t)3 )dt + \u03b2x2 (t)dw(t),\n\n\u221a\nwhere (\u03bc, \u03b1, \u03b2) = (0.5, 0.2, 0.2). The assumptions of Theorem 4.4 hold. The \u03b8-EM (3.1) with \u03b8 = 1,\napplied to (1.4) writes as\nXtk+1 = Xtk + (\u03bc \u2212 \u03b1Xt3k+1 )\u2206t + \u03b2Xt2k \u2206wtk .\n\n(4.15)\n\nSince we employ the BEM to approximate (1.4), on each step of the numerical simulation we need to\nfind the inverse of the function F (x) = \u03b1x3 \u2206t + x. In this case we can find the inverse function explicitly\nand therefore computational complexity is not increased. Indeed, we observe that it is enough to find\nthe real root of the cubic equation\n\u03b1Xt3k+1 \u2206t + Xtk+1 \u2212 (Xtk + \u03bc\u2206t + \u03b2Xt2k \u2206wtk ) = 0.\nIn Figure 1 we plot estrong\nagainst \u2206t on a log-log scale. Error bars representing 95% confidence intervals\n\u2206t\nare denoted by circles.

Therefore, it is reasonable to\ntake the BEM with the very small time step \u2206t = 2\u221214 as a reference solution. We then compare it to\nthe BEM evaluated with timesteps (21 \u2206t, 23 \u2206t, 25 \u2206t, 27 \u2206t) in order to estimate the rate\u221aof convergence.\nSince we are using Monte Carlo method, the sampling error decays with a rate of 1/ M , M - is the\nnumber of sample paths. We set M = 10000. From Figure 1 we see that there appears to exist a positive\nconstant such that\nestrong\n\u2264 C\u2206t for sufficiently small \u2206t.\n\u2206t\nHence, our results are consistent with a strong order of convergence of one-half.\n13\n\n\f5\n\nStability Analysis\n\nIn this section we examine the globally almost surely asymptotic stability of the \u03b8-EM scheme (3.1). The\nstability conditions we derive are more related to the mean-square stability, [20, 40]. First, we give some\npreliminary analysis for the SDEs (1.1). We give conditions on the coefficients of the SDEs (1.1) that\nare sufficient for the globally almost surely asymptotic stability. Later we prove that the \u03b8-EM scheme\n(3.1) reproduces this asymptotic behavior very well.\n\n5.1\n\nContinuous Case\n\nHere we present a simplified version of the stochastic LaSalle Theorem as proved in [42], using the\nLyapunov function V (x) = kxk2 .\nTheorem 5.1 (Mao et al.). Let Assumption 2.1 hold. We assume that there exists a function z \u2208\n\nC(Rn ; R+ ), such that\n\n1\nhx, f (x)i + kg(x)k2 \u2264 \u2212z(x)\n2\n\n(5.1)\n\nfor all x \u2208 Rn . We then have the following assertions:\n\u2022 For any x0 \u2208 Rn , the solution x(t) of (1.1) has the properties that\nlim sup kx(t)k2 < \u221e\n\na.s\n\nand\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nlim z(x(t)) = 0\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\na.s.\n\nWhat is more, when z(x) = 0 if and only if x = 0 then\nlim x(t) = 0\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\n5.2\n\na.s\n\n\u2200 x0 \u2208 Rn .\n\nAlmost Sure Stability\n\nWe begin this section with the following Lemma.\nLemma 5.2. Let Z = {Zn }n\u2208N be a nonnegative stochastic process with the Doob decomposition Zn =\n\nZ0 + A1n \u2212 A2n + Mn , where A1 = {A1n }n\u2208N and A2 = {A2n }n\u2208N are a.s. nondecreasing, predictable\nprocesses with A10 = A20 = 0, and M = {Mn }n\u2208N is local {Fn }n\u2208N -martingale with M0 = 0. Then\nn\n\no n\no n\no\nlim A1n < \u221e \u2286 lim A2n < \u221e \u2229 lim Zn exists and is finite\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\na.s.\n\nThe original lemma can be found in Liptser and Shiryaev [30]. The reader can notice that this lemma\ncombines the Doob decomposition and the martingales convergence theorem. Since we use the Lyapunov\nfunction V (x) = kxk2 , our results extend the mean-square stability for linear systems, Higham [15, 16],\nto a highly non-linear setting. The next theorem demonstrates that there exists a discrete counterpart\nof Theorem 5.1 for the \u03b8-EM scheme (3.1).\nTheorem 5.3.
