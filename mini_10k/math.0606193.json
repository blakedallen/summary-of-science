BRAUNGARDT AND D. KOTSCHICK\nA BSTRACT. We prove that every spherical football is a branched cover, branched only in the vertices, of the standard football made up of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons. We also give examples\nshowing that the corresponding result is not true for footballs of higher genera. Moreover, we\nclassify the possible pairs (k, l) for which football patterns on the sphere exist satisfying a natural\ngeneralisation of the usual incidence relation between pentagons and hexagons to k-gons and l-gons.\n\nDate: April 5, 2006; MSC 2000 classification: primary 52B05, 57M12, 57M15; secondary 05C25, 20E08.\n1\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\nA football pattern1 is a graph embedded in the two-sphere in such a way that all faces are pentagons and hexagons, satisfying the conditions that the edges of each pentagon meet only edges of\nhexagons, and that the edges of each hexagon alternately meet edges of pentagons and of hexagons.\nIf one requires that there are exactly three faces meeting at each vertex, then Euler's formula implies that the pattern consists of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons. Moreover, in this case the combinatorics of the pattern is uniquely determined. This pattern, which we shall refer to as the standard\nfootball, has a particularly symmetric realisation with all polygons regular, which can be thought\nof as a truncated icosahedron.\nIf one drops the requirement that there are exactly three polygons meeting at each vertex, then\none can exhibit infinitely many distinct football patterns by lifting to branched covers of the standard football branched only in vertices of the pattern. In the first part of this paper we shall prove\nthat these are the only football patterns on the two-sphere. For the proof we consider the dual\ngraph of a football pattern as a coloured ribbon graph. The dual of the standard football with 12\npentagons and 20 hexagons is shown in the picture on the first page of this paper. To make the\npicture symmetric, a black vertex is spread out at infinity and is depicted by the shaded ring around\nthe rest of the graph.\nOf course we could consider the dual graph as a map, but in order to make clear the distinction\nbetween football patterns and their duals, we will always use the language of maps, cf. [2], for the\nfootball patterns themselves, and the language of ribbon graphs, cf. [3], for their duals.\nAll the football graphs, that is ribbon graphs dual to football patterns, have the same universal\ncovering, which is a certain tree T . We shall determine the automorphism group of T and prove\nthat every cofinite subgroup of the automorphism group whose quotient gives rise to the dual of a\nspherical pattern is a subgroup of the group giving rise to the standard football. We also consider\nfootball patterns on surfaces of higher genera and show that the classification theorem does not hold\nfor them; in other words, not all of them can be obtained by taking branched covers of the standard\nfootball. However, football patterns on surfaces of higher genera always admit branched covers of\ndegree at most 60 which in turn are also branched covers of the standard spherical football.\nOne may wonder what special r\u00f4le pentagons and hexagons play in this discussion. We shall\naddress this question in the second part of this paper, where we determine all the possibilities for\ntriples (k, l, n) that can be realised by maps on the two-sphere whose faces are k-gons and l-gons\nsatisfying the conditions that the edges of each k-gon meet only edges of l-gons, and that every nth\nedge of each l-gon meets an edge of a k-gon, and its other edges meet l-gons. Not surprisingly,\nthe determination of these triples is a generalisation of the topological argument determining the\nPlatonic solids. In most cases the generalised football patterns have realisations dual to very symmetric triangulations of the sphere that have been known and studied since the 19th century. That\npurely topological or combinatorial considerations lead to a list that contains almost only the usual\nsymmetric patterns and their degenerations is a kind of rigidity phenomenon associated with these\nspherical triangulations.\nWe shall see that the classification theorem for spherical football patterns proved in the first part\nof this paper for the triple (5, 6, 2) actually holds for all generalised football patterns with n = 2:\neach generalized football with a pattern of type (k, l, 2) is a branched cover of the corresponding\nminimal pattern. We shall also see that this result does not extend to n > 2.\n1\n\nWe use English terminology. American readers might want to call our football patterns \"soccer ball patterns\".\n2\n\n\fAcknowledgement. We are grateful to B. Hanke and B.

A football pattern is a map in the sense of [2] on the two-sphere satisfying\nthe usual conditions that at least three edges meet at every vertex, that all faces are pentagons and\nhexagons, that the edges of each pentagon meet only edges of hexagons, and that the edges of each\nhexagon alternately meet edges of pentagons and of hexagons. We make no regularity assumption,\nso that a football pattern is not a geometric, but a combinatorial-topological object.\nA football pattern determines, and is determined by, its dual graph. This graph has a vertex for\nevery polygon in the pattern, and the vertices are coloured, say black for the vertices corresponding\nto pentagons and white for the vertices corresponding to hexagons. Two vertices are connected by\nan edge if the corresponding polygons share an edge. The edges meeting at a vertex are cyclically\nordered (with respect to this endpoint) by remembering that the sides of a polygon are cyclically\nordered. Therefore the dual graph is a fatgraph or ribbon graph in the sense of [3], leading to the\nfollowing definition:\nDefinition 1. A football graph is a ribbon graph with black and white vertices satisfying the following conditions:\n(1) each black vertex has valence five, and all five edges connect the given vertex to white\nvertices, and\n(2) each white vertex has valence six, and the six edges alternately2 connect the given vertex\nto black and white vertices.\nThe picture at the beginning of this paper shows the dual ribbon graph of the standard football\npattern on S 2 consisting of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons. To make the picture symmetric, a black\nvertex is spread out at infinity and is depicted by the shaded ring around the rest of the graph.\nAs every finite ribbon graph corresponds to a unique closed oriented surface, we have a natural\nbijection between football graphs and football patterns on arbitrary closed oriented surfaces. A\ncovering map between football graphs corresponds to a possibly branched covering map between\nsurfaces, with any branching restricted to the centers of the faces of the decompositions given by\nthe football graphs. As the football graphs are dual to actual football patterns, branching can only\noccur at the vertices of patterns.\nLet b and w be the numbers of black and white vertices in a football graph \u0393. Then the total\nnumber of vertices is v = b + w, and the number of edges is e = 21 (5b + 6w). Of these edges,\ne1 = 32 w have white endpoints, and e2 = 5b = 3w have a black and a white endpoint. It follows\nthat there is a natural number d such that b = 6d and w = 10d.\nLemma 1. The only football graph giving a triangulation of a closed surface is the dual graph \u03930\nof the standard spherical football with d = 2.\nProof. Let \u03a3 be the closed oriented surface defined by a football graph \u0393. By Euler's formula, the\nnumber of faces in the cell decomposition of \u03a3 determined by \u0393 is\nf = \u03c7(\u03a3) + e \u2212 v = \u03c7(\u03a3) + 45d \u2212 16d = \u03c7(\u03a3) + 29d .\n2The\n\nalternating condition is with respect to the cyclic order of the edges.\n3\n\n\fIf \u0393 defines a triangulation of \u03a3, then we must have 2e = 3f , which, rewritten in terms of d,\nmeans 90d = 3\u03c7(\u03a3) + 87d, or d = \u03c7(\u03a3). Thus d = 2, and \u03a3 is S 2 . The combinatorics of the\ncorresponding football pattern is uniquely determined in this case, as can be seen from the proof\nof Theorem 2 below.\n\u0003\n1.2. The football tree. There is precisely one connected and simply connected football graph,\nwhich we shall call the football tree T . It is the universal cover of any football graph. As T thought\nof as a ribbon graph is an orientable surface, it makes sense to speak of orientation-preserving\nautomorphisms, and we shall denote the group of all such automorphisms by Aut(T ). This can be\ndetermined explicitly:\nTheorem 1. The automorphism group Aut(T ) of the football tree is isomorphic to the free product\nZ2 \u22c6 Z3 \u22c6 Z5 .\nProof. This is a straightforward application of the Bass\u2013Serre theory of groups acting on trees,\ncf. [4]. This theory is usually formulated for groups acting on trees without inverting edges. In our\nsituation, there are automorphisms inverting edges that connect a pair of white vertices. Therefore,\nwe subdivide each of these edges by introducing red vertices in the middle of each edge connecting\ntwo white edges of T . We obtain a new tree T \u2032 , which has three kinds of edges: the white and black\nones of valence 6 and 5 respectively, and red ones of valence 2. The red and black vertices are only\nconnected to white ones, and the edges meeting at a white vertex lead alternately to red and black\nvertices. Now Aut(T ) acts on T \u2032 without inverting any edges. The action is simply transitive on\nthe two kinds of edges, black-white and red-white. The action is also transitive on the vertices of\na given colour, with isotropy groups of orders 2, 3 and 5 for the red, white and black vertices. The\nquotient graph T \u2032 / Aut(T ) is a tree with three vertices, one for each colour, and with one edge\nconnecting the white vertex to each of the other vertices. We think of this as a graph of groups by\nlabeling the vertices with the isotropy groups. As the edges have trivial isotropy, the fundamental\ngroup of this graph of groups is the free product of the labels of the vertices. By the structure\ntheorem of Section I.5.4 in [4], this fundamental group is isomorphic to Aut(T ).\n\u0003\n1.3. The classification of spherical footballs. We now want to prove that every football pattern\non the sphere is obtained as a branched cover of the standard football branched only in the vertices.\nEquivalently, we prove that the spherical dual ribbon graphs are all obtained as covering spaces of\nthe dual graph of the standard football. The first step is the following:\nLemma 2. Let \u0393 be a football graph with universal covering \u03c0 : T \u2212\u2192 \u0393. Suppose that \u03b3 is an\noriented path in T consisting of a sequence of edges without backtracking. If \u03c0 maps \u03b3 to a closed\npath that corresponds to a boundary component of \u0393 thought of as a surface with boundary, then \u03b3\nconsists of 3n edges for some natural number n, and the image of \u03b3 in the standard football graph\n\u03930 is a loop that is the nth power of the loop formed by a triangle in the triangulation defined by\n\u03930 , cf. Lemma 1.\nProof. We think of T as a surface with boundary. Choose a boundary component C covering the\nboundary component \u03c0(C) of \u0393 to which \u03b3 is mapped. As a boundary component of T , C runs\nright along a sequence {ei }i\u2208Z of oriented edges in T such that, of course, the origin o(ei ) of each\nedge coincides with the endpoint of the previous edge, and, in addition, with respect to the cyclic\norder of edges emanating from o(ei ) = o(\u0113i\u22121 ), ei is the successor of \u0113i\u22121 . (The bar denotes edge\ninversion.) It follows from Definition 1 that the sequence of vertices o(ei ) is of the form black,\nwhite, white, black, white, white, etc.\n4\n\n\fThe setwise stabilizer of C in Aut(T ) is the infinite cyclic group generated by the translation \u03c4 ,\nwhich maps ei to ei+3 . Now \u03c0(C) = C/G, for some subgroup G 6 Stab(C), i. e. G = h\u03c4 n i for\nsome n \u2208 N. Thus \u03c0(C) runs along a 3n-gon, which must be \u03c0(\u03b3).\nBy assumption, the path \u03b3 is a piece ej+1, . . . , ej+k of the sequence {ei } and projects to \u03c0(\u03b3).\nTherefore k = 3n. The images of ei in the standard football still satisfy the condition that consecutive edges be related by the cyclic ordering defining the ribbon graph structure. But this means\nthat the image of ej+1 ej+2 ej+3 is a triangle.\n\u0003\nHere is the classification theorem for spherical football patterns:\nTheorem 2. Every football graph dual to a football pattern on S 2 is a finite covering space of\nthe standard football graph \u03930 . Equivalently every football pattern on S 2 is obtained from the\nstandard one by passing to a branched cover branched only in vertices of the pattern.\nProof. Given a spherical football graph \u0393, fix a universal covering \u03c0 : T \u2192 \u0393 of \u0393 and a universal\ncovering \u03c00 : T \u2192 \u03930 of the standard football graph \u03930 . We are going to show that the group of\ndeck transformations Aut\u0393 T is a subgroup of Aut\u03930 T . This implies that \u03c00 factors through \u03c0.\nChoose a point p on an edge of T that is not an endpoint or a midpoint, so that it has trivial\nstabilizer in Aut(T ). Covering space theory identifies the group of deck transformations Aut\u0393 T\nwith the fundamental group \u03c01 (\u0393; \u03c0(p)). Since \u0393 is spherical, this fundamental group is generated\nby paths of the form \u03b2\u03b3\u03b2 \u22121 , where \u03b3 is a loop along a boundary component, \u03b2 runs from the base\npoint \u03c0(p) to the origin of \u03b3 and \u03b2 \u22121 is the way back. Lifting \u03b2 and \u03b3 to T we obtain a path\n\u03b2\u0303\u03b3\u0303\u03c4 n (\u03b2\u0303 \u22121 ) leading from p to \u03c4 n (p), with \u03c4 from the proof of the previous lemma. Hence \u03c4 n is the\ndeck transformation corresponding to the given generator of \u03c01 (\u0393; \u03c0(p)). This proves the result,\nbecause \u03c4 is a deck transformation over \u03930 .\n\u0003\nThis proof also shows:\nCorollary 1. The subgroup \u03c01 (\u03930 ) \u2282 Aut(T ) is normal. The quotient Aut(T )/\u03c01 (\u03930 ) is the\nicosahedral group of order 60.\n1.4. Footballs of positive genera. Every ribbon graph corresponds to a unique closed oriented\nsurface, and of course every such surface does indeed arise from a football graph, for example\nbecause it is a branched covering of the two-sphere, which we can arrange to be branched only in\nthe vertices of a suitable football pattern. We now want to show that there are other football patterns\non surfaces of positive genera, that are not lifted from the two-sphere. The proof of Theorem 2\ndoes not extend, because for a ribbon graph corresponding to a surface of positive genus there are\ngenerators in the fundamental group that arise from handles, rather than from the punctures.\nRecall that the parameter d for a finite football graph specifies the number of black and white\nvertices by the formulae b = 6d and w = 10d. Passing to a D-fold covering multiplies d by D. As\nthe standard football graph \u03930 has d = 2, all its non-trivial coverings have d > 4. Therefore, to\nexhibit football graphs that are not coverings of \u03930 , it suffices to find examples of positive genus\nwith d < 4. Performing certain cut-and-paste operations on \u03930 , we can actually produce examples\nwith d = 2 and rather large genera.\nThe simplest example is the following.\nExample 1. Pick two disjoint edges in the standard football pattern, that are of the same type, so\nthat they both separate hexagons from each other, or they both separate a pentagon from a hexagon.\nOpen up the two-sphere along these edges to obtain a cylinder whose two boundary circles each\n5\n\n\fhave two vertices and two edges. As the two edges along which we opened the sphere were of\nthe same type, the two boundary circles of the cylinder can be identified in such a way that the\nresulting torus carries an induced football pattern with d = 2.\nIn this example there are 58 vertices instead of the 60 in the standard spherical football. All but\ntwo of them are 3-valent, and the exceptional two are 6-valent.\nIn the language of ribbon graphs, the surgery performed in the above example amounts to cutting\ntwo ribbons and regluing the resulting ends in a different pairing. This can also be done with\nribbons corresponding to edges that share a vertex, in which case instead of cutting and pasting,\nthe surgery can be described through the reordering of edges:\nExample 2. Let e1 , . . . , e5 be the edges emanating from a black vertex in the standard football graph\n\u03930 . Define a new football graph \u0393 by reordering the edges as e1 , e3 , e2 , e4 , e5 . This procedure glues\nthe three triangles whose edges include e2 or e3 into a single 9-gon boundary component of \u0393. This\nnew graph still has d = 2, but the underlying surface is a torus. In the dual football pattern there\nare 58 vertices, of which 57 are 3-valent and one is 9-valent.\nExample 3. Let e1 , . . . , e6 be the edges emanating from a white vertex in the standard football\ngraph \u03930 , enumerated in their cyclic order and labelled such that e1 , e3 and e5 have black ends.\nDefine a new ribbon graph by reordering the edges cyclically as e1 , e4 , e3 , e6 , e5 , e2 . This means\nthat the edges leading to white vertices are cut and reattached after a cyclic permutation given\ngeometrically by a rotation by angle 2\u03c0\naround the vertex in the realisation of \u03930 with icosahedral\n3\nsymmetry.\nWe apply this procedure to every white vertex of \u03930 . The resulting football graph \u0393 is symmetric\nin the sense that it admits rotations of order 2, 3 and 5 around an edge, a white vertex and a black\nvertex, respectively. Hence the full football group Aut(T ) acts on \u0393. In particular all faces are\nconjugate. One can verify by inspection that the faces are 15-gons. Hence the Euler characteristic\nof the underlying surface is \u221246, and its genus is 24. This is a football graph with d = 2 and is\ntherefore not a covering of \u03930 .\nAlthough football graphs of positive genera are not in general coverings of \u03930 , we have the\nfollowing:\nTheorem 3. Every football pattern on a closed oriented surface admits a branched cover of degree\nD 6 60 that is also a branched cover of the standard minimal pattern on S 2 . The bound for D is\nsharp.\nProof. Let \u0393 be a finite football graph. As \u03c01 (\u03930 ) \u2282 Aut(T ) is a subgroup of index 60, the\nintersection \u03c01 (\u03930 ) \u2229 \u03c01 (\u0393) has index at most 60 in \u03c01 (\u0393). The intersection corresponds to a\ncovering of \u0393 of degree D 6 60 that is also a covering of \u03930 .\nTo prove that coverings of degree strictly less than 60 do not always suffice, recall that Aut(T )\nacts on the genus 24 football graph \u0393 from Example 3. This is equivalent to the fundamental group\n\u03c01 (\u0393) being a normal subgroup of Aut(T ). The covering of \u0393 corresponding to the subgroup\nN = \u03c01 (\u03930 )\u2229\u03c01 (\u0393) of Aut(T ) is a Galois covering with Galois group \u03c01 (\u0393)/N. Now the injection\n\u03c01 (\u0393) \u2192 Aut(T ) induces an embedding of \u03c01 (\u0393)/N as a normal subgroup of the orientationpreserving icosahedral group Aut(T )/\u03c01 (\u03930 ), isomorphic to the alternating group A5 . Since this\nis a simple group we must have \u03c01 (\u0393)/N \u223c\n= A5 or {1}. The second case is excluded because \u0393 is\nnot a covering of \u03930 .\n\u0003\n6\n\n\f1.5. Non-orientable footballs. Although we have modelled football patterns as ribbon graphs,\nwe can also consider them on non-orientable surfaces, because the condition that every other edge\nemanating from a white vertex should connect to a black vertex is preserved by inversion of the\ncyclic order.\nHere are the simplest examples for the projective plane.\nExample 4. A football pattern on the real projective plane is readily constructed from the standard\nfootball. In the dual ribbon graph \u03930 cut a single ribbon and reglue it with a half-twist so that the\nsurface becomes non-orientable. This gives a football pattern with d = 2 that, instead of the 60\nvertices of valence 3 in the standard football, has 58 vertices of valence 3 and a unique vertex of\nvalence 6. Therefore the Euler number of the surface is 1.\nIf we lift the pattern in this example to the universal covering of the projective plane, we obtain\na football pattern with d = 4 on the two-sphere, which, by Theorem 2, is a 2-fold branched cover\nof the standard pattern. Of course in this case the branched covering structure can be seen directly,\nby focussing on the two vertices of valence 6.\nExample 5. The usual symmetric realisation of the standard football pattern on the sphere as a\ntruncated icosahedron is symmetric under the antipodal involution. Thus it descends to a pattern\non RP 2 with d = 1.\n2. G ENERALISED\n\nFOOTBALL PATTERNS\n\nIn this section we consider generalisations of the traditional football patterns.\nDefinition 2. A generalised football pattern is a map on the two-sphere whose faces are k-gons\nand l-gons satisfying the conditions that the edges of each k-gon meet only edges of l-gons, and\nthat every nth edge of each l-gon meets an edge of a k-gon, and its other edges meet l-gons.\nTo avoid degenerate cases we always assume k > 3, l > 3 and l = n * m with positive integers\nm and n. As usual, at least three edges meet at every vertex.\nIf a given triple (k, l, n) can be realised by a generalised football pattern, then it can be realised\nin infinitely many ways, for example by taking branched covers branched only in the vertices of\na given pattern. We will determine all possible triples, and we will find a minimal realisation for\neach of them. We will also see that in some cases there are realisations that are not branched covers\nof the minimal one.\nBefore proceeding to the classification, we list some examples for future reference.\n2.1. Some examples. The standard football realising the triple (5, 6, 2) can be thought of as a\ntruncated icosahedron. More generally, we have:\nExample 6. The truncated Platonic solids realise the triples (3, 6, 2), (3, 8, 2), (3, 10, 2), (4, 6, 2)\nand (5, 6, 2) as generalised football patterns.\nThere are also infinite series of examples obtained by truncating the degenerate Platonic solids:\nExample 7. Start with a subdivision of the sphere along k > 3 halves of great circles running from\nthe north to the south poles. We shall call this an American football. If we now truncate at one\nof the poles, we obtain a realisation of the triple (k, 3, 3). (For k = 3 this is a tetrahedron.) If we\ntruncate at both poles, we obtain a tin can pattern realising (k, 4, 2). (For k = 4 it is a cube.) This\nis also known as a k-prism. If we add k edges along the equator to this last example, we obtain a\ndouble tin can realising (k, 4, 4), for any k > 3.\n7\n\n\fF IGURE 1. Variation on Platonic solids\nHere is a variation on the above tin can pattern:\nExample 8. Take a k-gon, with k > 3 arbitrary, and surround it by pentagons in such a way that the\ntwo pentagons meeting a pair of adjacent sides of the k-gon share a side. We can fit together two\nsuch rings made up of a k-gon and k pentagons each along a zigzag curve to obtain a realisation of\nthe triple (k, 5, 5) by a generalised football pattern. (For k = 5 we obtain a dodecahedron.)\nThe next two examples need to be visualised using the accompanying figures.\nExample 9. Take a Platonic solid, and subdivide each face as follows. If the face is a k-gon,\nput a smaller k-gon in its interior, and radially connect each corner of this smaller k-gon to the\ncorresponding corner of the original face. In this way each face of the original polyhedron is\ndivided into a k-gon and k quadrilaterals. The cases k = 3 and 4 are shown in Figure 1. Next\nwe erase the edges of the original polyhedron, so that the two quadrilaterals of the subdivison\nmeeting along an edge are joined to form a hexagon. In this way we obtain a realisation of the\ntriple (k, 6, 3). We shall refer to this construction as a variation on the original Platonic solid.\nExample 10. Again we start with a Platonic solid whose faces are k-gons. We subdivide each face\ninto a smaller k-gon and k hexagons as shown in Figure 2. This gives a realisation of the triple\n(k, 6, 6).\n2.2. The classification of generalised football patterns. Now we want to prove that the previous\nexamples exhaust all possible generalised football patterns with n > 2. We shall also treat the case\nn = 1. The results of this classification are summarised in the table in Figure 3.\nIf S 2 is endowed with a generalised football pattern of type (k, l, n), we shall think of the k-gons\nas being black and the l-gons as being white. Their numbers are denoted by b and w respectively.\nThe pattern then has f = b + w many faces, it has e = 12 (bk + wl) many edges, and the number\nv of vertices is bounded by v 6 13 (bk + wl) as there have to be at least 3 faces meeting at every\nvertex.\nCounting the number of edges at which a k-gon meets an l-gon in two different ways, we find\n(1)\n\nk*b=\n\n1\n*l*w = m*w .\nn\n8\n\n\fF IGURE 2. Subdivision of Platonic solids\nComputing the Euler characteristic and using (1) leads to:\n1\n1\n2 = f \u2212 e + v 6 b + w \u2212 (k * b + l * w) = b + w \u2212 k * b * (n + 1) .\n6\n6\nDividing by 2k * b we obtain the key inequality\n1\nn+1\n1\n1\n(2)\n+\n6\n+\n.\nk*b\n12\n2k 2m\n2.2.1. The case n > 2. If n > 2, then the left hand side of (2) is strictly larger than 41 . If both k and\nm are at least 4, then the right hand side is at most 41 . Thus n > 2 implies k = 3 or m \u2208 {1, 2, 3}.\nWe now discuss these cases separately.\nFor every possible triple (k, l, n) the inequality (2) gives a lower bound for b. With (1) we then\nhave a lower bound for w. Checking these values against the examples of the previous section, one\nsees for most of the examples that they actually give minimal realisations. There are only a few\ncases when this simple check does not suffice, because the minimal realisations have vertices of\nvalence strictly larger than 3.\nLemma 3. Suppose the triple (k, l, n) with k = 3 and n > 2 is realised by a generalised football\npattern. Then (k, l, n) is one of the triples (3, 4, 2), (3, 6, 2), (3, 8, 2), (3, 10, 2), (3, 3, 3), (3, 6, 3),\n(3, 4, 4), (3, 5, 5), (3, 6, 6). Minimal realisations are given by the Examples 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.\nProof. Putting k = 3 in (2) we obtain\n1\nn\n1\n1\n+\n6\n+\n.\n3b 12\n12 2m\nTogether with n > 2, this implies m 6 5.\nIf m = 5, then we obtain n = 2 from (3). Thus l = 10. The truncated dodecahedron from\nExample 6 is a minimal realisation.\nIf m = 4, then again n = 2 from (3). Thus l = 8. The truncated cube from Example 6 is a\nminimal realisation.\nIf m = 3, then again n = 2 from (3). Thus l = 6. The truncated tetrahedron from Example 6 is\na minimal realisation.\n\n(3)\n\n9\n\n\fIf m = 2, then (3) gives n 6 3. For n = 3, equivalently l = 6, a minimal realisation is the\nvariation on the tetrahedron from Example 9. For n = 2, equivalently l = 4, we get the case k = 3\nof the truncated American football in Example 7.\nIf m = 1, then (3) only gives n 6 6. For n = 6, therefore l = 6, the subdivision of the\ntetrahedron from Example 10 gives a minimal realisation. For n = l = 5, the case k = 3 in\nExample 8 is a minimal realisation. For n = l = 4, the case k = 3 of the double tin can in\nExample 7 is a realisation. As it has vertices of valence 4, it is not immediately obvious that it is a\nminimal realisation. In this case (3) gives b > 1, but one can easily check that b = 1 is not possible.\nThus b is at least 2, and the double tin can is indeed a minimal realisation. For n = l = 3, the case\nk = 3 of the partially truncated American football in Example 7 is a minimal realisation. Note that\nm = 1 implies n > 3, so that we have now exhausted all cases with k = 3 and n > 2.\n\u0003\nLemma 4. Suppose the triple (k, l, n) with l/n = m = 3 and n > 2 is realised by a generalised\nfootball pattern. Then (k, l, n) is one of the triples (3, 6, 2), (4, 6, 2), (5, 6, 2). Minimal realisations\nare given by the truncated Platonic solids in Example 6.\nLemma 5. Suppose the triple (k, l, n) with l/n = m = 2 and n > 2 is realised by a generalised\nfootball pattern. Then (k, l, n) is one of the triples (3, 6, 3), (4, 6, 3), (5, 6, 3), or (k, 4, 2) with\nk > 3. Minimal realisations are given by the variations on the Platonic solids in Example 9,\nrespectively by the truncated American football in Example 7.\nWe omit the proofs of Lemmas 4 and 5, because they are completely analogous to, and even\nsimpler than, the proof of Lemma 3.\nLemma 6. Suppose the triple (k, l, n) with l/n = m = 1 and n > 2 is realised by a generalised\nfootball pattern. Then (k, l, n) is one of the triples (3, 6, 6), (4, 6, 6), (5, 6, 6), or (k, 3, 3), (k, 4, 4),\n(k, 5, 5) with k > 3. Minimal realisations are given by the subdivisions on the Platonic solids in\nExample 10, respectively by the infinite sequences in Examples 7 and 8.\nProof. For m = 1, equivalently l = n, we obtain n 6 6 for all k > 3 from (2).\nIf l = n = 6, then we also have k 6 5 from (2). Thus k is 3, 4 or 5, and minimal realisations are\ngiven in Example 10.\nIf l = n = 5, then all k > 3 are possible, and minimal realisations are given in Example 8.\nIf l = n = 4, then all k > 3 are possible, and realisations are given by the double tin cans in\nExample 7. To see that these realisations are minimal, it suffices to exclude the case b = 1, which\nis easily done by contradiction.\nIf l = n = 3, then again all k > 3 are possible, and minimal realisations are given by the\npartially truncated American football in Example 7.\n\u0003\nThis completes the classification of generalised football patters with n > 2 on the two-sphere.\n2.2.2. The case n = 1. A generalised football pattern with n = 1 consists of b black k-gons and w\nwhite l-gons so that the two polygons meeting along an edge always have different colours. Note\nthat here the situation is completely symmetric in k and l.\nLemma 7. Suppose the triple (k, l, 1) is realised by a generalised football pattern on S 2 . Then,\nup to changing the r\u00f4les of k and l, (k, l) is one of the pairs (3, 3), (3, 4) or (3, 5). Minimal\nrealisations are obtained by painting the faces of an octahedron, a cuboctahedron, respectively an\nicosidodecahedron, in a suitable manner.\n10\n\n\fProof. Counting the edges in two different ways leads to b * k = w * l. As every edge separates\na black from a white polygon, there must be an even number of faces meeting at every vertex.\nTherefore the valence of every vertex is > 4, giving rise to\n1\nv 6 (b * k + w * l) ,\n4\nwhich is of course stronger than what we had before, when the valence of a vertex was only > 3.\nComputing the Euler characteristic as before, we obtain instead of (2) the stronger\n(4)\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n+ 6\n+ .\nk*b 4\n2k 2l\n\nIf both k and l are > 4, then the right hand side is 6 41 , which is impossible. Thus k or l is = 3.\nBy the symmetry between k and l we may assume that k = 3. Substituting this into (4), we find\n(5)\n\n1\n1\n1\n+\n6\n,\n3b 12\n2l\n\nwhich implies l 6 5.\nIf l = 3, then b = w > 4. A realisation is obtained by painting the faces of an octahedron in\nblack and white, so that each edge separates a black face from a white one.\nIf l = 4, then (5) implies b > 8, so that w > 6. The cuboctahedron, cf. [1], is a realisation.\nIf l = 5, then (5) implies b > 20, so that w > 12. The icosidodecahedron, cf. [1], is a realisation.\nAll these realisations are minimal, because they have precisely four faces meeting at every vertex, so that (5) becomes an equality.\n\u0003\nWe summarise the above classification of the generalised football patterns as follows:\nTheorem 4. Suppose that S 2 admits a map whose faces are k-gons and l-gons with k, l > 3, such\nthat the edges of each k-gon meet only edges of l-gons, and so that every nth edge of each l-gon\nmeets an edge of a k-gon, and its other edges meet l-gons. Then l 6 10 and n 6 6. There are\n16 different sporadic triples (k, l, n) with k 6 5 that occur, together with 4 infinite sequences with\nvariable k and fixed l and n. All the possibilities are listed in the table in Figure 3, which also\ngives minimal realisations for all cases.\nThe different minimal realisations were described in our earlier examples, and in the course of\nthe proof. There are several alternative descriptions of items 12.\u201314. The variation on the tetrahedron is nothing but a partially truncated cube, truncated at 4 of its 8 vertices, chosen so that each\nface is truncated at two diagonally opposite corners. Similarly, the variations on the cube and the\ndodecahedron are partial truncations of the rhombic dodecahedron and of the rhombic triacontrahedron respectively. The subdivisions in items 18.\u201320. can also be thought of as partial truncations of\nthe dodecahedron, the pentagonal icositetrahedron, respectively the pentagonal hexecontrahedron.\nIn order to make the symmetries more obvious, the table does not list triples (k, l, n), but rather\n(k, m, n) with m = l/n. Note that this makes no difference when n = 1, in which case there is a\ncomplete symmetry between k and l = m. Therefore, the cases 2. and 3., respectively 4. and 5., are\ndual to each other, obtained by switching the roles of k and l. Case 1. is self-dual. Similarly, cases\n7. and 8., respectively 9. and 10., are dual to each other with the duality induced by the duality of\nPlatonic solids, and case 6. is self-dual.\n11\n\n\f1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\n11.\n12.\n13.\n14.\n15.\n16.\n17.\n18.\n19.\n20.\n\nk\n3\n3\n4\n3\n5\n3\n3\n4\n3\n5\n>3\n3\n4\n5\n>3\n>3\n>3\n3\n4\n5\n\nm\n3\n4\n3\n5\n3\n3\n4\n3\n5\n3\n2\n2\n2\n2\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\nn\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n3\n3\n3\n3\n4\n5\n6\n6\n6\n\nminimal realisation\noctahedron\ncuboctahedron\ncuboctahedron\nicosidodecahedron\nicosidodecahedron\ntruncated tetrahedron\ntruncated cube\ntruncated octahedron\ntruncated dodecahedron\ntruncated icosahedron = football\ntruncated American football\nvariation on the tetrahedron\nvariation on the cube\nvariation on the dodecahedron\npartially truncated American football\ndouble tin can\nzigzag tin can\nsubdivision of the tetrahedron\nsubdivision of the cube\nsubdivision of the dodecahedron\n\nb\n4\n8\n6\n20\n12\n4\n8\n6\n20\n12\n2\n4\n6\n12\n1\n2\n2\n4\n6\n12\n\nw\n4\n6\n8\n12\n20\n4\n6\n8\n12\n20\nk\n6\n12\n30\nk\n2k\n2k\n12\n24\n60\n\nF IGURE 3. The classification of generalised football patterns on S 2\n2.3. Branched covers for generalised football patterns. Now that we have an overview of all\nthe generalised football patterns, one may ask whether Theorem 2 can be extended, to prove that\nevery generalised spherical football is a branched cover of the corresponding minimal example,\nbranched only in the vertices. It is not hard to see that for n = 2 this is indeed the case:\nTheorem 5. If (k, l, 2) is realised by a generalised football pattern on S 2 , then every spherical\nrealisation is a branched cover, branched only in the vertices, of the minimal realisation. In particular the minimal realisation is unique.\nProof. The minimal realisations for n = 2 have all vertices of valence 3. Equivalently, the dual\ngraph triangulates the sphere. Moreover, every realisation has the property that the valence of every\nvertex is a multiple of 3, with every third face a black k-gon. Therefore the proofs of Lemma 2 and\nof Theorem 2 go through.\n\u0003\nFor larger values of n one loses control of the structure of the vertices, and the proof breaks\ndown.\nExample 11. Consider the case k = l = n = 3. The minimal realisation is a partially truncated\nAmerican football with k = 3, which we can also think of as a painted tetrahedron, in which one\nface is black and the others are white. Another, non-minimal, realisation is obtained by painting\nthe faces of an octahedron so that two opposite faces are black, and the remaining six faces are\nwhite. This is not a branched cover of the painted tetrahedron.\n12\n\n\fNote that in this example the minimal realisation has two kinds of vertices: one at which all\nfaces meeting there are white, and three at which one black and two white faces meet. For the\nnon-minimal realisation described above one has one black and three white faces meeting at every\nvertex. It is a general feature of the generalised football patterns with n > 3 that the combinatorial\ndefinition of the pattern does not imply any control over the local structure at a vertex. For n = 2\nwe do have such control, leading to Theorem 5.\nR EFERENCES\n1. H. S. M. Coxeter, Regular Polytopes, Methuen & Co. Ltd. London 1948.\n2. G. A. Jones and D.
