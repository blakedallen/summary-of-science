We\ninvestigate, by first-principles density functional theory, the bias-dependent transport properties of\nan all-oxide SrRuO3 /BaTiO3 /SrRuO3 MTJ.

In such an MTJ not only can the tunneling magnetoresistance reach enormous values, but also, for certain voltages, its sign can be changed by altering\nthe barrier electric state. These findings pave the way for a new generation of electrically-controlled\nmagnetic sensors.\n\nThe control of the spin dependent tunneling between\ntwo ferromagnetic electrodes separated by an insulating\nbarrier has enabled enormous advances in many magnetic data storage technologies, in particular since extremely large tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) was\nmeasured. The progress in producing magnetic tunnel\njunctions (MTJs) with large TMR was initially limited\nby the use of amorphous tunnel barriers. The situation\nhowever changed after the prediction [1, 2] and subsequently experimental realization [3, 4] of epitaxial MTJs.\nSince then, room temperature TMR in excess of 600%\nhas been demonstrated in MgO-based devices [5].\nIn general, for amorphous barriers the spin polarization\nof the tunneling current and hence the TMR magnitude,\ndepend solely on the electrodes' density of states (DOS)\nat the Fermi level, EF [6]. In contrast, perfectly crystalline tunnel barriers are wave-function symmetry selective and make the tunneling process sensitive to their\nelectronic structure. As a result the amplitude and even\nsign of the TMR may depend on the barrier itself. The\nunderstanding of such a concept suggests that one can\nengineer the TMR by carefully selecting the insulating\nbarriers to be epitaxially grown on magnetic electrodes.\nFerromagnets [7] and ferroelectrics [8, 9] are of particular\ninterest as functional barriers.\nFerroelectric materials possess a spontaneous electric\npolarization whose direction can be switched by an electric field. This makes ferroelectric-based MTJs fully\nmulti-functional devices able to respond to both electrical\nand magnetic stimuli [8, 10]. Importantly ferroelectrics\ncan be grown epitaxially on a variety of substrates [11]\nbut in particular on other oxides. Since epitaxial growth\nis a pre-requisite for large TMR, the prospect of all-oxide\njunctions appears particularly attractive. Such a type of\nMTJ is investigated in this Letter. We demonstrate theoretically a huge TMR and more importantly we show\nthat the TMR sign can be reversed with bias, at a critical bias which depends on the ferroic state of the barrier.\nOur results are rationalized in terms the band-structure\nmatch between the ferroelectric insulator and the ferro-\n\nmagnetic electrodes.\nDensity functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed with the local basis set code siesta [12]. Structural relaxation is obtained with the generalized gradient\napproximation (GGA) of the exchange and correlation\nfunctional [13]. This gives a satisfactory device geometry,\nbut it produces a rather shallow band alignment mainly\nbecause of the DFT-GGA gap problem. In order to make\nup for this shortfall the electronic structure used for the\ntransport calculations is that obtained with the atomic\nself-interaction correction (ASIC) scheme [14], which improves drastically the electronic properties of both bulk\nBaTiO3 [15] and SrRuO3 [16]. Unfortunately the approximate ASIC energy functional is not sufficient to produce\ngood structural parameters and in particular the BaTiO3\nferroelectric state cannot be stabilized. This is a current\nlimitation of the method, which otherwise has been successful in predicting the electronic properties of oxides\n[18]. For this reason we perform ASIC transport calculations at the GGA relaxed structural parameters. For\nall the calculations we use a 6\u00d76\u00d71 k-point MonkhorstPack mesh and a grid spacing equivalent to a plane-wave\ncutoff of 800 eV.\nElectron transport is computed with the smeagol\ncode [19, 20], which combines the non-equilibrium\nGreen's function scheme with DFT. Since smeagol interfaces siesta as the DFT platform, we employ here the\nsame parameters used for the total energies calculations.\nIn brief, the total electronic current is given by\nI \u03c3 (V ) =\n\ne\nh\n\nZ\n\ndE T \u03c3 (E; V ) [fL \u2212 fR ] ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c3 labels the spin (\u2191, \u2193), T \u03c3 (E; V ) is the energy dependent transmission coefficient for the bias V , fL/R is\nthe Fermi distribution function evaluated at E \u2212 \u03bcL/R\nand \u03bcL/R = EF \u00b1 eV\n2 is the chemical potential of the\nleft/right electrode. If the junction is perfectly translational invariant in the plane orthogonal to the transport\ndirection, T \u03c3 is obtained by integrating the ~k-dependent\n\n\f2\nT~k\u03c3 over the 2D Brillouin zone of volume \u03a9BZ ,\n1\nT (E, V ) =\n\u03a9BZ\n\u03c3\n\nZ\n\nBZ\n\nd~k T~k\u03c3 (E; V ) .\n\n(2)\n\n2\n\n1\n\nE-EF (eV)\n\nWe initially perform relaxation of bulk BaTiO3 and\nSrRuO3 under an in plane compressive strain emulating the common epitaxial growth on SrTiO3 . The relaxed cells are then used to construct the transport supercell, which comprises of six BaTiO3 unit cells (\u223c2.5 nm)\nsandwiched at either side by three SrRuO3 ones. The\nSrRuO3 /BaTiO3 interface is SrO/TiO2 , due to the experimentally observed volatility of the RuO2 termination\n[21]. We consider two structures. In the first non-ferroic\n(NFE) structure the atoms are frozen artifically in their\ncentro-symmetric positions with the interfacial distance\ngiven by an average between the BaTiO3 and SrRuO3\nc-lattice constant. In the second the supercell is further\nrelaxed with respect to the atomic coordinates, resulting\nin a stable ferroelectric ground state (FE structure).\n\ndxz and dyz ). Finally the dx2 \u2212y2 and dxy states have \u22062\nand \u22062\u2032 symmetry respectively. Importantly an incident\nBloch state in the electrodes can couple to a given evanescent state in the insulator, and then sustain a tunneling\ncurrent, only if the two share the same symmetry.\nThe left panel of Fig. 2 shows the SrRuO3 bandstructure close to EF along the direction of the transport. At EF only a doubly-degenerate minority \u22065 state\nis available, in contrast to previous DFT calculations,\nwhere both minority (\u2193) \u22065 and majority (\u2191) \u22061 bands\nwere found [10]. Such a discrepancy is due to the use of\nthe GGA functional in Ref. [10], which underestimates\nthe Ru d manifold exchange splitting [16]. Note that a\nlarge spin splitting is expected based on point contact\nAndreev reflection experiments [17].\n\n\u22061\n\nMajority\nMinority\n\n\u22062\nNFE\nFE\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n\u22061\n\n\u22065\n\n\u22061\n\n\u22065\n\n\u22065\n\n-2\n\n\u0393\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Relative atomic displacement for\nSr, Ba (open circle) and Ru, Ti (filled circle) in the\nSrRuO3 /BaTiO 3 /SrRuO3 MTJ investigated. The displacements are with respect of the O atoms in the same plane,\n\u03b4 = (zcation \u2212 zO ), with z being stack direction. The device\ngeometry is presented in the lower part of the figure.\n\nThe atomic relaxed displacements, \u03b4, with respect to\nthe planar O positions are shown in Fig. 1. At the center of the the BaTiO3 slab Ti displaces by 0.14 \u00c5, which\nis significantly smaller than the value of 0.23 \u00c5 of bulk\nBaTiO3 experiencing the same strain. Note that GGA\noverestimates the volume and atomic distortions associated with ferroelectricity in BaTiO3 resulting in a \"supertetragonal\" structure. Such an overestimation, while resulting in a polarization greater than the experimental\none, has not a significant qualitative effect on our results. The interfacial SrRuO3 layers, as expected, also\ncontribute to the polarization [22].\nThe symmetry of the electronic bands of both the ferromagnetic electrodes and the insulating spacer dictates\nthe transport properties. A wavefunction, whether propagating or evanescent, is described in terms of irreducible\nrepresentations of the crystal's symmetry group. For a\ncubic space group, the \u22061 symmetry transforms as a linear combination of 1, z and 2z 2 \u2212 x2 \u2212 y 2 functions, while\nthe \u22065 as a linear combination of zx and zy (e.g. px , py ,\n\nZ Z\n\n\u0393\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\u03ba (1/c)\n\n4\n\n5\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) ASIC-calculated band-structure along\nthe transport direction (\u0393 \u2192 Z) for centro-symmetric tetragonal SrRuO3 (left), and BaTiO3 (middle) both in the NFE\n(green) and FE (red) configuration. The wavefunction symmetries of the bands close to EF are indicated. The right\npanel reports the complex band-structure for BaTiO3 . The\nenergies are aligned with the EF of SrRuO3 .\n\nIn the right panel of Fig. 2 we plot the BaTiO3 real\nand complex band-structure. In contrast to MgO, where\nstates with \u22065 symmetry decay significantly faster than\nthose with \u22061 [1], in NFE BaTiO3 the \u22061 and \u22065 symmetries have comparable decay rates. In particular close\nto the valence band top the slower decay rate is for \u22061 ,\nwhile the situation is reversed at the conduction band\nminimum. The enlargement of the bandgap associated\nwith the FE order results in an increased decay rate for\nall the symmetries. The effect is more pronounced for\n\u22065 close to the top of the valence band where now the\n\u22061 symmetry primarily contributes to the tunnel conductance.\nWe begin our analysis of the transport properties from\nthe NFE structure by showing T (E) at zero bias for the\nparallel (PA) and antiparallel (AP) magnetic alignment\nof the electrodes (Fig. 3). In the PA configuration T (E)\nclose to EF is dominated by the minority spin channel.\nThis is expected from the band-structure of SrRuO3 ,\n\n\f\u0393\nZ 100\n\n\u22065\u2191\n\n\u22065\u2193\n\n\u22062\u2191 \u2206\n2\u2193\n\n\u22061\u2191\n\n\u22061\u2193\n\n-5\n\n10\n\nT (E)\n\n10\n\nParallel \u2191\nParallel \u2193\n\n-10\n-15\n\n10 0\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n10\n\n-10\n\nAntiparallel\n\n-15\n\n10 -3 -2.5 -2 -1.5 -1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5\n\nE-EF (eV)\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Transmission coefficients, T (E), as a\nfunction of energy for the NFE structure.

At the top we report again the SrRuO3\nband-structure at the \u0393 point of the 2D transverse BZ. The\ndotted line at 0 eV denotes EF .\n\ntion the electron transmission occurs between majority\n(minority) states in the left-hand side electrode and minority (majority) in the right-hand side one, so that T (E)\nfor both the spins (identical) is essentially a convolution\nof those for the majority and minority spin channels of\nthe PA state. As a consequence there is a drastic suppression of T (E) in the regions -0.8 eV < E < 0.1 eV and\n0.3 eV < E < 0.8 eV, where respectively the \u22065 \u2193 and\n\u22061 \u2191 bands in one electrode are not paired in the other.\nIn particular T (EF ) for the AP configuration is orders of\nmagnitude smaller than in the PA one. Note that our discussion is based on the band-structure at the \u0393-point of\nthe 2D transverse BZ, for which the decay is the smallest\nand the transmission the largest. However, also Bloch\nstates with larger transverse wave-vector contribute to\nthe transport and produce a residual transmission.\nThe spin-polarized current for both the PA and AP\nconfigurations and for both the NFE (top panel) and\nFE (middle panel) structures are shown in Fig. 4, where\nwe focus on the low voltage region in which the current is due entirely to tunneling (the broader I-V are\ndisplayed in the insets). The most distinctive feature\nemerging from the I-V curves is the presence of negative differential resistances (NDR) for the PA alignment,\noriginating from the movement of the \u22061 \u2191 band-edge\n\n2\n\n5 NFE\n0\n\n4\n\n10\n0\n\n-5\n\n4\n\n-10\n\n-2000-1000 0 1000 2000\n\nParallel\nAntiparallel\n\n0.5 FE\n\n2\n\nI (A/m )\n\n-10\n\nTMR\n\nwhich presents only a \u22065 \u2193 band along the transport\ndirection for energies comprised between \u22120.8 eV and\n+0.1 eV.

In the energy window 0.3 eV < E < 0.8 eV\nthere are no minority states available and T \u2193 drastically drops. A similar drop, due to the lack of minority\nSrRuO3 bands is found at -2.5 eV.

In the bottom panel we present the TMR\nas a function of voltage for both the geometries. In the insets\nthe I-V is presented over a larger current range (the units are\nthe same as in the main figure). Note that at the on-set of the\nBaTiO3 conduction and valence bands the current increases\nby three orders of magnitude over its low bias value.\n\nwith V . Because of the NDR the relative magnitude of\nthe current for the parallel (I PA ) and antiparallel alignment (I AP ) can be reversed, i.e. the TMR changes\nsign with V . This is demonstrated in the lower panel\nof Fig. 4, where we present the \"pessimistic\" TMR ratio, TMR=(I PA \u2212 I AP )/(I PA + I AP ), as a function of\nbias. Clearly TMR sign inversion is observed for both\nthe NFE and the FE junctions for voltages in the range\n0.7-0.9 V. Furthermore for V \u223c 0.7 V the TMR for the\nNFE junction is positive, while that of the FE one is\nnegative, meaning that subtle changes in the barrier electronic structure, such as those induced by ferroelectricity, are sufficient to change the sign of the TMR. Note\nalso that the TMR values reported here are actually extremely large. For instance for both the NFE and FE\njunctions and voltages |V | < 0.4 V the optimistic TMR\n[(I PA \u2212 I AP )/I AP ] is around 5,000%.\nThe I-V curve can be rationalized by looking at the\ndependence of T (E) on the bias [23], which is presented\nin Fig. 5. This is mainly determined by the shift of the\nelectrodes' \u22061 and \u22065 band-edges with V : for positive\nvoltage the band-structure of the left electrode is shifted\nby +eV /2 (e is the electron charge) and that of the right\none by \u2212eV /2. At a given energy a large T is found\nonly if a band of the same symmetry and spin is found\nin both electrodes at that energy. For PA alignment at\nV = 0, the minority spins dominate the transmission up\nto 0.3 eV, after which one encounters the \u2206\u21935 upper bandedge and T \u2193 is drastically reduced. As V is applied, the\n\n\f4\n\u2206\u21935 band edge is shifted to lower energies in the right\nelectrode (for V > 0), so that for V = 0.6 V the high\ntransmission region extends only up to EF , and for V =\n1.2 V it extends only up to EF \u22120.3 eV. This is the origin\nof the NDR found for the PA alignment. In contrast\nfor the AP configuration T is small for energies below\n0.1 eV after which it drastically increases because of the\n\u22061 conduction bands (see Fig. 3). With increasing V the\n\u22061 band in the right electrode is shifted to lower energies,\nso that there is a rather large transmission inside the\nbias window, and eventually the AP current therefore\nbecomes larger than the PA one. This results in the\nTMR sign change at about 0.7-0.9 V.\n\nverted as the applied bias increases. Furthermore the sign\ninversion occurs at different voltages for different ferroic\nstates of the barrier. Our finite-bias results are explained\nin term of the electrodes and the barrier band-structures.\nThe possibility to control the TMR by manipulating the\nferroic state of the barrier in an MTJ opens a potential\navenue for the electrical control of magnetic devices.\nThis work is supported by Science Foundation of Ireland (Grants No. 07/IN.1/I945), by CRANN and by\nthe EU FP7 ATHENA.

The left\npanels are for the parallel configuration and the right ones for\nthe antiparallel. In the same figure we report data for both\nthe NFE structure (\u2191 black solid line, \u2193 black dashed line)\nand for the PE one (\u2191 red solid line, \u2193 red dashed line). The\nvertical dashed lines mark the borders of the bias window.\n\nThe main effect of the ferroelectric order on the transport is an increase of the BaTiO3 band-gap, i.e. an increase of the \u22061 and \u22065 decay coefficients (see Fig. 2). In\nparticular, states with \u22065 symmetry decay significantly\nfaster in the FE MTJ with respect to the NFE one. This\nresults in a global reduction of the transmission although\nother general features remain rather similar in the two\ncases. The comparison between T (E; V ) for the FE and\nNFE junctions is also presented in Fig. 5. Below EF\none may note a substantial reduction of the transmission\nwhen going from NFE to FE for both PA and AP alignment as a consequence of the increased \u22065 decay rate.\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated huge TMR in an\nall-oxide ferroelectric MTJ, the sign of which can be in-\n\n\u2217\ncorresponding authors: caffreyn@tcd.ie, sanvitos@tcd.ie\n[1] W.H.
