INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Biot-Savart law [1\u20134] is one of the most basic relations in electricity and magnetism.\nIt allows one to determine the total magnetic field B at a given point in space as the\nsuperposition of infinitesimal contributions dB, caused by the flow of current I through\nan infinitesimal path segment ds, oriented in the same direction as the current. If r\u0302 is the\nposition unit-vector pointing from the element of length to the observation point P , then the\ntotal field contribution due to a closed circuit C at P is given by a closed line integral [1\u20134]\nB=\n\n\u03bc0 I\n4\u03c0\n\nI\n\nC\n\n(ds \u00d7 r\u0302)\n,\nr2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bc0 is the permeability of free space and the path of integration is along the wire.\nThe usefulness of the Biot-Savart law goes far beyond its basic textbook applications.\nEquation (1) is a much studied integral form which arises in various interesting physical\nproblems involving topological defects [5], magnetic fluids [6], amphiphilic monolayers [7],\ntype-I superconductors [8] and the n-body problem of celestial mechanics [9]. In the framework of classical electrodynamics the Biot-Savart law provides a useful technique to calculate\nthe magnetic field generated by current carrying wires. Equation (1) is quite general, valid\nfor nonplanar current loops of arbitrary shape. Obviously, the presence of a cross-product\nin the formula may introduce some difficulties in practical calculations. Ultimately, the\nrange of problems to which equation (1) can be applied is limited primarily by the difficulty\nexperienced in performing the integrations. These difficulties are less serious if the loop C is\nflat and if the observation point lies in the plane of the loop. It has been recently shown [10]\nthat the magnitude of the magnetic field due to an arbitrarily shaped (not self-intersecting),\nplanar, current carrying wire at a point lying on the wire's plane can be written as\n\u03bc0 I\nB=\n4\u03c0\n\nI\n\n2\n\nC\n\nd\u03b8\n.\nr\n\n(2)\n\n\fEquation (2) is very simple and compact, expressing B in terms of the wire shape r = r(\u03b8),\nwhere \u03b8 denotes the polar angle. As shown in reference [10], this basic result expands the\ndegree of applicability of the Biot-Savart law allowing exact, closed form solutions for a\nwhole new set of elementary problems.\nBased on the general nature of the Biot-Savart law, its connection to recent physics\nresearch topics [6\u20139], and its success in performing magnetic field calcultions, we felt motivated to investigate the following question: is it possible to formulate a Biot-Savart-like law\nin electrostatics ? If so, what sort of electrostatic problem could be more easily solved by\nsuch an approach? In this work we address these issues and show, for the first time, that it\nis indeed possible to formulate a Biot-Savart-type law in the realm of electrostatics.\nThe formulation we propose is suitable to calculate the electric field due to an arbitrary\nshaped, planar region maintained at a fixed scalar potencial V, with the rest of the plane\nheld at zero potential. We show that the calculation of the electric field produced by such a\nregion is analogous to the evaluation of the magnetic field due to a flat current carrying wire\nof the same shape (figure 1). We point out that the \"brute-force\" calculation of the electric\nfield due to such an arbitrarily shaped region, kept at a fixed potential, by directly applying\nconventional boundary-value techniques [11] may be quite challenging. The nontrivial nature of the problem comes from the fact that we do not know the surface charge distribution\nin advance. Our eletrostatic Biot-Savart law provides a much simpler way to perform this\nnontrivial electric field calculation, and allows one to borrow many of the standard procedures ordinarily used in the corresponding magnetostatic situation. Therefore, complicated\nelectrostatic problems may have straightforward solutions, if solved by the Biot-Savart-like\napproach we develop here. We stress that, even though our derivation and new results (8)\nand (9) presented below are quite simple, they have not been derived in any standard electromagnetism book or journal publication. This work comes to fill this gap, offering a new\n\n3\n\n\fand simple tool to perform electric field calculations.\nAs a by-product, we obtain a very compact expression for the electric field in the plane\nof the flat sheet (see equation (9)), which is as simple as its magnetic field counterpart\ngiven by equation (2). Finally, we illustrate our results by explicitly calculating the electric\nfield produced by a constant potential, flat region that has the shape of a regular, n-sided\npolygon, for observation points located along its axis of symmetry. The calculation for\nthe field produced in the plane of regions having other peculiar shapes (elliptical, spiral,\nregularly undulating) is also presented.\n\nII. ELECTRIC FIELD CALCULATION\n\nConsider an arbitrarily shaped, two-dimensional region, located in the x-y plane, kept\nat a fixed potential V while the rest of the plane is held at zero potential (see figure 2). The\nshape of the flat plate is determined by a closed boundary curve C. We want to calculate\nthe electric field caused by this charge configuration at a given observation point P located\nby the vector x\nE(x) = \u2212\u2207\u03a6(x),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03a6(x) denotes the electric scalar potential.\nSince the scalar potential is specified everywhere on the x-y plane, we have to solve a\nDirichlet problem [11]. We apply Dirichlet boundary conditions, i.e., GD (x, x\u2032 ) |z \u2032 =0 = 0,\nwhere GD (x, x\u2032 ) denotes the Green's function for Dirichlet conditions, and the primed vector\nx\u2032 locates the charge distribution points. Using Green's theorem and the fact that the volume\ncharge density \u03c1(x\u2032 ) = 0, the electrostatic potential for z > 0 can be expressed in terms of\nthe value of the potential on the plate \u03a6(x\u2032 ) = V [11]\n1 Z\n\u2202GD\n\u03a6(x) = \u2212\n\u03a6(x\u2032 )\n4\u03c0\n\u2202n\u2032\n4\n\n!\n\nda\u2032 ,\n\n(4)\n\n\fwhere n\u0302\u2032 = \u2212\u1e91\u2032 is the outward unit normal and da\u2032 is an infinitesimal area element of the\nplate.\nBy employing the method of images [11], we can easily find the Green's function by\nconsidering the potential in x due to a unit point charge located at a point in the region\nz > 0, plus the potential of an image charge placed in a symmetric position in the lower-half\nplane z < 0. Through this procedure we calculate (\u2202GD /\u2202n\u2032 ) = (\u2212\u2202GD /\u2202z \u2032 )|z \u2032=0 explicitly,\nand rewrite equation (4) as\n\u03a6(x) =\n\nV\n\u03a9(x),\n2\u03c0\n\n(5)\n\nwhere\n\u03a9(x) =\n\nZ\n\n(\u2212\u1e91) * (x\u2032 \u2212 x) \u2032\nda\n|x \u2212 x\u2032 |3\n\n(6)\n\nis the solid angle subtended by the surface (flat plate of area a\u2032 ) spanning the loop C as\nseen from x. The sign convention established for the solid angle is the following: \u03a9(x) is\npositive when the observation point P views the \"inner\" side of the flat plate, in other words,\n\u03a9(x) > 0 if the unit normal points away from P . This sign convention is the same as the\none adopted in references [3,4].\nBy substituting equations (5) and (6) into the electric field equation (3) and using the\nwell-known relation [12]\n\u2207\u03a9(x) =\n\nI\n\nC\n\nds\u2032 \u00d7 (x \u2212 x\u2032 )\n,\n|x \u2212 x\u2032 |3\n\n(7)\n\nwe finally obtain\nV\nE(x) =\n2\u03c0\n\nI\n\nC\n\n(x \u2212 x\u2032 ) \u00d7 ds\u2032\n,\n|x \u2212 x\u2032 |3\n\n(8)\n\nwhere ds\u2032 is an element of length of the integration path C. The direction of the integration\naround C is determined by the direction of the outward unit normal via the right-hand\n5\n\n\frule. Notice that the cross-product in (8) has a reversed order in comparison to the one\nthat appears in the magnetostatic case (1). This distinction is necessary to give the correct\ndirection for the electric field vector at the observation point P .\nEquation (8) is our central result. It allows the calculation of the electric field through a\nBiot-Savart-type law. Notice that (8) is written in terms of a line integral, so to calculate the\nelectric field we just need to take into account the contributions coming from the boundary\ncontour C. This result makes the solution of the electrostatic problem much easier. Under\nthe circumstances studied in this work, the traditional Dirichlet problem can be mapped\nonto a Biot-Savart-like problem, a mapping that can simplify considerably the computation\nof the electric field in many problems of interest.\nAs it was in the magnetic case [10], a much simpler expression for the field can be\nobtained if we concentrate our attention in the calculation of the electric field at observation\npoints that lie in the plane of the charge distribution. Using the same arguments as those\npresented in reference [10] it can be easily shown that\nV\nE(x) =\n2\u03c0\n\nI\n\nC\n\nd\u03b8\n\u1e91,\nr\n\n(9)\n\nwhere r = |x \u2212 x\u2032 |. Equation (9) is a surprisingly simple result. Note that this line integral\nexpression (9) works for flat charge distributions of any boundary shape, including those\ndescribed by curves C which are not single valued functions of \u03b8. In addition, it is valid for\nobservation points P located either inside or outside the loop C. To illustrate our approach,\nin the next section we calculate the electric field due to specific planar charge configurations\nof some representative shapes.\n\nIII. ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES\n\nIn this section we illustrate the usefuness the the Biot-Savart-like law (8) by discussing\na class of electrostatic problem that is trivially solved by using (8) or (9), but that would\n6\n\n\frequire a much more involved solution otherwise. We start by applying equation (8) to\ncalculate the electric field due to a thin, flat plate, which has the shape of a regular n-sided\npolygon, inscribed in a circle of radius a (see figure 3). Consider that the flat plate is located\nin the x-y plane with its center at the origin, and that it is maintained at a fixed potential\nV . In the plane z = 0 the region outside the plate is held at zero potential. We wish to\ncompute the electric field at a point P in the z-axis.\nAs discussed in section 2, by inspecting equation (8) we notice that in order to calculate the electric field due to this flat configuration, we just need to take into account the\ncontributions coming from the boundary contour C. Let us analyze this point a little more\ncarefully: the total electric field at point P in the z-axis can be written as the superposition\nof the field due to n triangles obtained by joining the center of circle to the vertices of the\npolygon (figure 3). If we sum all the contributions from these various triangular paths, we\nwill be left with the integration around the contour C. This happens because the sense\nof integration along their common sides is opposite for two adjacent triangles, making the\ncontributions from the common sides to cancel. Therefore, after performimg the integration\naround all the triangles, the only nonzero contributions come from the n straight edges that\ndefine the plate's boundary contour C. With these considerations in mind we turn to the\nfield calculation itself.\nWhen the field contributions of the n sides are summed vectorially, the horizontal (x-y\nplane) components add to zero. By symmetry, only the vertical components located along\nthe z-axis will survive. From figure 3 we verify that the total electric field at P is given by\nE = n En cos \u03b1,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere En is the net field due to just one of the n triangles that compose the polygon\nq\n\nand cos \u03b1 = a cos (\u03c0/n)/ a2 cos2 (\u03c0/n) + z 2 . Considering the fact that the only nonzero\ncontribution from such triangular path comes from the single edge of the polygon, we employ\n7\n\n\fequation (8) to get\nEn =\n\nV\na sin (\u03c0/n)\nq\n.\n\u03c0 [a2 cos2 (\u03c0/n) + z 2 ] [a2 + z 2 ]\n\n(11)\n\nUsing equations (10) and (11) we obtain the total electric field along the z-axis\nV\nE=\n2\u03c0\n\n(\n\nna2 sin (2\u03c0/n)\n\u221a\n[a2 cos2 (\u03c0/n) + z 2 ] a2 + z 2\n\n)\n\n\u1e91.\n\n(12)\n\nThis result is quite handy since it provides, all at once, the calculation of the electric field\nalong the z-axis due to any regular polygon of n sides (equilateral triangle, square, pentagonal, etc.). We point out that our electric field result (12) agrees with the equivalent (but\nconceptually distinct) formula for the magnetic field at the axis of an n-sized polygonal,\ncurrent carrying circuit, previously obtained in reference [13].\nIt is worth mentioning that result (12) can also be used compute the magnitude of the\nelectric field along the axis passing through the center of a circular conducting plate of radius\na. This can be easily obtained by taking the limit n \u2192 \u221e in equation (12) yielding\nE=\n\nV a2\n\u1e91.\n[a2 + z 2 ]3/2\n\n(13)\n\nThis limit agrees with reference [14], in which the potential calculation is done solely for the\ncircular plate, by employing traditional boundary-value problem techniques.\nWe conclude this section by calling the attention of the reader to the fact that the\ncalculation of the electric field at observation points lying in the plane of flat plates of\nvarious shapes can be obtained, with great facility, by directly using our expression (9).\nFor example, the magnitude of the electric field in the plane of elliptical, spiral shaped and\nharmonically deformed circular plates (see figure 4), kept at a fixed potential V , are readily\nobtained by (9). Table 1 displays the values of the electric field at observation points P , for\nthese three characteristic flat regions. So, despite the boundary curve especific geometry,\nthe E field calculation may be promptly performed by using our Biot-Savart-like approach.\n8\n\n\fIn practical terms the difficulty of having a complicated boundary shape is not a very serious\nobstacle in order to compute E in closed form, as long as the related integrations are not\nterribly hard to handle.\n\nIV. CONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nIn this work we show that, under certain circumstances, complicated electrostatic problems may have straightforward solutions, if solved by a Biot-Savart-like approach. We\nconsider the general situation in which a flat region of arbitrary shape is kept at a fixed\npotential V , in a otherwise grounded plane. The objective is to compute the electric field\ndue to this nontrivial charge distribution at a given point in space. At first glance, such\na calculation looks very involved, mainly because we have no prior knowledge about the\nprecise charge distribution on the planar region. We derived a Biot-Savart-like law suitable\nto deal with such electrostatic situation, allowing the calculation of the electric field to be\ndone in a simple fashion.\nThis Biot-Savart-like law is written in terms of a line integral along the boundary contour\ndefined by the nonzero potential region, so that the calculation does not require information\nabout the charge distribution in the bulk. As a by-product, we show that for observation\npoints located in the z = 0 plane, the Biot-Savart-like expression can be written in a very\nsimple and compact form, as was the case for similar magnetic field calculations recently\npublished in reference [10]. We illustrate our results by calculating the electric field along\nthe axis of a polygonal flat region of n sides, kept at a constant potential V . In addition,\nwe calculate the magnitude of the electric field in the plane of charged plates presenting\nnontrivial boundary geometries such as elliptical, spiral and regularly undulating borders.\nIn summary, we show that it is possible to define a Biot-Savart-like in electrostatics. Our\nnew approach provides an alternative and simple technique to solve a class of complicated\n9\n\n\fboundary value problems in electrostatics.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by CNPq and FINEP (Brazilian Agencies).\n\n10\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] Halliday D, Resnick R and Walker J 1997 Fundamentals of Physics (New York: John\nWiley & Sons) pp 729-732\n[2] Griffiths D J 1989 Introduction to Electrodynamics (New Jersey: Prentice Hall) pp 207211\n[3] Jackson J D 1975 Classical Electrodynamics (New York: John Wiley & Sons) pp 169-173\n[4] Eyges L 1980 The Classical Electromagnetic Field (New York: Dover Publications, Inc.)\npp 117-123\n[5] Kroener E 1955 Dislocations and the Biot-Savart Law Proc.
