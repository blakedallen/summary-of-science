Introduction\nModern 10 m class telescopes equipped with instruments\nlike the High-Resolution Echelle Spectrograph (HIRES) at\nthe Keck Observatory or the UV-Visual Echelle Spectrograph\n(UVES) at the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) facilitate the\naccurate observation of QSO absorption (or emission) lines in\norder to study the hypothetical variability of fundamental physical constants like the fine-structure constant \u03b1 = e2 /(4\u03c0\u01eb0 ~c)\nor the proton-electron mass ratio \u03bc = mp /me . The interest in\nthese studies is motivated by the unification theories incorporating varying fundamental constants (for a review see, e.g.,\nUzan 2003).\nFrom the astronomical point of view the cosmological variability of the fine-structure constant is assessed as\n\u2206\u03b1/\u03b1 = (\u03b1z \u2212 \u03b10 )/\u03b10 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b10 and \u03b1z denote the values of the fine-structure constant in the laboratory and the specific absorption (or emission) line system at redshift z, respectively. While observational studies based on the fine-structure splitting of intergalactic alkali-doublet (AD) absorption lines (e.g., Levshakov 1994;\nMurphy et al. 2001b) and intrinsic QSO emission line doublets\n(Bahcall et al. 2003) have provided robust upper bounds on\n|\u2206\u03b1/\u03b1|, Murphy et al. (2003a, hereafter MFW) have recently\ndetected a non-zero expectation value h\u2206\u03b1/\u03b1i for a sample of\nSend offprint requests to: R. Quast,\ne-mail: rquast@hs.uni-hamburg.de\n\u22c6\nBased on observations made with ESO Telescopes at the La Silla\nor Paranal Observatories under programme ID 066.A-0212.\n\n143 complex metal absorption systems identified in QSO spectra recorded with the Keck/HIRES: h\u2206\u03b1/\u03b1i = (\u22125.7\u00b11.1)*10\u22126\nin the redshift range 0.2 < z < 4.2. This remarkable statistical evidence for a cosmological variation of the fine-structure\nconstant is achieved by means of the many-multiplet (MM)\ntechnique, which is a generalization of the AD method incorporating the multi-component profile decomposition of many\ntransitions from different multiplets of different ionic species\n(Dzuba et al. 1999; Murphy et al. 2003b, hereafter MWF, and\nreferences therein). While the MM technique considerably improves the formal accuracy, it also shows some immanent deficiencies. Levshakov (2003) illustrates in detail that the prerequisite assumption that the spatial distribution is the same for all\nionic species is not valid in typical intergalactic absorption systems. Consequently, it is more reliable to apply the MM technique to samples of absorption lines arising from only one ionic\nspecies. Furthermore, in comparison to the AD calculations\nthe incorporation of more transitions over a wider wavelength\nrange results in a stronger susceptibility to systematic effects.\nNevertheless, sources of error like wavelength miscalibration,\nspectrograph temperature variations, atmospheric dispersion,\nand isotopic or hyperfine-structure effects do demonstrably not\nexplain the detected non-zero expectation value (Murphy et al.\n2001a, MWF, MFW). The observational discrepancy grows\nsince the radioactive decay rates of certain long-lived nuclei\ndeduced from geophysical and meteoritic data provide a stringent bound, h\u2206\u03b1/\u03b1i = (8 \u00b1 8) * 10\u22127, back to the epoch of Solar\nsystem formation, z \u2264 0.45 (Olive et al. 2003).\nIn the optical spectroscopy, the most striking deficiency\ninherent to all decomposition techniques are non-linear inter-\n\n\fR.

Observations\nHE 0515\u20134414 was observed with UVES during ten nights\nbetween October 7, 2000 and January 3, 2001. Thirteen exposures were made in the dichroic mode using standard settings for the central wavelenghts of 3460/4370 \u00c5 in the blue,\nand 5800/8600 \u00c5 in the red. The CCDs were read out in fast\nmode without binning. Individual exposure times were 3600\nand 4500 s, under photometric to clear sky and seeing conditions ranging from 0.47 to 0.70 arcsec. The slit width was\n0.8 arcsec providing a spectral resolution of about 55 000 in\nthe blue and slightly less in the red. The ThAr lamp exposures\ntaken immediately after each science exposure provide an accurate calibration in wavelength. The standard deviation of the\nwavelength versus pixel dispersion solution is about 2.0 m\u00c5\n(2.5 m\u00c5) in the blue (red), resulting in an absolute accuracy of\nabout 0.15 km s\u22121 in radial velocity space. The raw data frames\nwere reduced at the ESO Quality Control Garching using the\nUVES pipeline Data Reduction Software.

Clearly, in order to solve the profile decomposition\nproblem spectral observations with the highest possible resolution and the highest possible signal-to-noise ratio are desirable.\nIn this study, we present exceptional high-resolution and\nhigh signal-to-noise spectra of the notably bright intermediate\nredshift QSO HE 0515\u20134414 (Reimers et al. 1998, z = 1.73,\nB = 15.0) recorded with the VLT/UVES.

The systemic rest wavenumber \u03c9i = 1/\u03bbi is\nparametrized as\n\nevolution strategy (ES) based on the concept of covariance matrix adaption (Hansen et al. 2003). We ignore the ensemble of\nFe \uf769\uf769 \u03bb2383 and \u03bb2600 lines associated with the central region\nof the sub-DLA system since the profiles are saturated and are\notherwise overemphasized in the optimization.\n\n\u03c9i = \u03c90,i + qi (\u2206\u03b1/\u03b1) (2 + \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1),\n\n3.2.

In\naddition, the set of Fe \uf769\uf769 transitions between \u03bb1608 and \u03bb2600\nalready provides a very sensitive combination for probing the\nvariability of the fine-structure constant.\nEach absorption component is modelled by a superposition\nof Doppler profiles with identical radial velocities, widths, and\ncolumn densities. In addition, the value of \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1 is confined\nto be the same for all components. In order to find the optimal set of parameter values for both \u03c4(\u03bb) as well as C(\u03bb), the\nweighted sum of residual squares is minimized by means of an\n\nThe standard MM technique can conveniently be revised to\navoid the deficiencies pointed out in Sect. 1. In fact, this\ntechnique is essentially similar to the method developed by\nVarshalovich & Levshakov (1993) in order to infer the cosmological variability of the proton-electron mass ratio \u03bc from the\nanalysis of molecular hydrogen absorption lines. Argueing by\nanalogy (Levshakov 2003), in the regime |\u2206\u03b1/\u03b1| \u226a 1 we obtain the linear approximation\nzi = z\u03b1 + \u03ba\u03b1 Qi ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere zi = \u03bbobs /\u03bb0,i and Qi = qi /\u03c90,i denote, respectively, the\nobserved redshift and the sensitivity coefficient corresponding\nto the line i, and the slope parameter \u03ba\u03b1 is given by\n\u03ba\u03b1 = \u22122(1 + z\u03b1 ) (\u2206\u03b1/\u03b1).\n\n(5)\n\nIf \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1 is non-zero, zi and Qi will be correlated and we will be\nable to estimate the slope \u03ba\u03b1 and the intercept z\u03b1 from the linear regression analysis of the position of the line centroids in an\n\n\f4\n\nR. Quast et al.: Probing the variability of the fine-structure constant with the VLT/UVES\n\nabsorption component. The accuracy of the regression analysis\nwill be improved, if several absorption line samples are combined. In this case, the regression procedure can be generalized\nappropriately:\n\u03b6i = (\u2206\u03b1/\u03b1) (Qi \u2212 Q\u0304),\n\n(6)\n\nwhere Q\u0304 denotes the mean sensitivity coefficient of the sample,\nand \u03b6i = (z\u0304 \u2212 zi )/[2(1 + z\u0304)] is the normalized redshift while z\u0304 denotes the mean redshift of an absorption component (in radial\nvelocity space \u03b6i = (\u016b \u2212 ui )/[2(c + \u016b)]).\nIn order to determine the central position of several selected\nFe \uf769\uf769 lines (see Sect. 4.2) we basically follow the same strategy\nas described in Sect. 3.1. The only differences are that we do\nnot incorporate Eq. (3) and do not confine the radial velocities to be the same for the lines in the selected components.\nWe point out explicitly that even though we apply a parametric\nprofile decomposition technique to determine the position of\nthe line centroids, the RMM analysis is not tied to any specific\nmodelling technique. In principle, the position of the line centroids can even be determined without doing any modelling at\nall (cf. Levshakov 2003). Throughout the analysis we use the\natomic data listed in Table 1.\n\n4. Results and discussion\n\n4.1. Standard MM analysis\nThe optimized values of the model parameters and the standard deviations provided by the covariance matrix of the ES\nare listed in Table 2. The decomposition of the Fe \uf769\uf769 absorption complex is quite evident (see Figs. 1 and 2). This contrasts with the QSO absorption systems considered in former\nMM studies where many components are typically unresolved\nand many line profiles are saturated (see MWF, Figs. 3 and 4).\nClearly, the components with the most accurately defined line\ncentroids (No. 1, 12, 20\u201324, 26) are the most important in the\nMM analysis. Expectedly, the adequate profile decomposition\nis reflected in the formal accuracy of the result: h\u2206\u03b1/\u03b1iMM =\n(0.1 \u00b1 1.7) * 10\u22126 is the most stringent formal bound hitherto\ninfered from an individual QSO absorption system. The best\nformal accuracy achieved in former MM analyses (see MWF,\nTable 3) is exceeded by a factor of about three.\n\nTable 2. Standard MM analysis: optimized values and formal\nstandard deviations of the radial velocity u, the line broadening\nvelocity b, and the column density N of the 29 components\nconstituting the Fe \uf769\uf769 absorption complex. The optimized value\nof h\u2206\u03b1/\u03b1i is h\u2206\u03b1/\u03b1iMM = (0.1 \u00b1 1.7) * 10\u22126 .

The regression\nline (Fig. 3) indicates no correlation between the relative displacement of the lines, \u03b6, and the sensitivity coefficient Q:\nh\u2206\u03b1/\u03b1iRMM = (\u22120.4\u00b11.9\u00b12.7sys)*10\u22126 , where the statistical errors of \u03b6 and the estimated errors of Q as well as the systematic\nuncertainties inherent to the wavelength calibration are propagated by means of Monte Carlo simulation. The coefficient of\n\nContributing to the discussion of potential systematic effects\npresented in MWF and MFW, we recall attention to another important source of error. As formerly illustrated by\nLevshakov & D'Odorico (1995) and Levshakov (1994), the\npresence of unresolved narrow lines with different optical\ndepths can strongly affect the position of the line centroids in\nan ensemble of lines and result in a biased expectation value\nh\u2206\u03b1/\u03b1i. This effect will be most noticeable in the case of optically thick lines. In fact, the expectation value h\u2206\u03b1/\u03b1iMM increases by 3.6 * 10\u22126 if we do not ignore the ensemble of saturated Fe \uf769\uf769 \u03bb2383 and \u03bb2600 profiles in the optimization, and the\nsystematic increase of scatter in the normalized residuals with\n\n\fR.

Conclusions\nOur results strongly support the null hypothesis of a nonvarying fine-structure constant, but do not contradict the MFW\nresult h\u2206\u03b1/\u03b1i = \u22125.7 * 10\u22126 at a significance level higher than\n88 percent. Nevertheless, we conclude: (i) The MM technique\nhas the capability to provide stringent bounds on h\u2206\u03b1/\u03b1i even\nif the analysis is restricted to the Fe \uf769\uf769 lines only. (ii) The RMM\ntechnique is illustrative and methodically more transparent than\nthe standard MM technique. In addition, the regression analysis\nfacilitates the consideration of systematic errors inherent to the\nwavelength calibration of QSO spectra. (iii) The accuracy of\nthe individual \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1 assessment is principally limited by systematic errors inherent to the wavelength calibration. The accuracy attainable with high-quality QSO spectra recorded with\nthe VLT/UVES is limited to 10\u22125 .

Normalized residuals of the optimized RMM model. For the purpose of residual analysis the calculation of the sum of\nresidual squares takes into account the optically thick parts of the line ensemble. The systematic increase of scatter with increasing\noptical depth may be explained by the presence of unresolved narrow lines or by deviations from the Doppler profile resulting\nfrom e.g. kinematic effects due to rotational motion (Prochaska & Wolfe 1997)\n\n300\n\n250\n\nCounts\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\nNormalized Residual\n\n2\n\n4\n\nFig. 5.
