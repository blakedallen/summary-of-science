In the present research, we add\na potential of a spherically symmetric nucleus and thus the total potential becomes\nMd\nMb\n\u03a6(r, \u03c6) = \u2212 \u221a\n\u2212q \u0002\n\u0003\n2\n2\nr +\u03b1\nr2 1 + (b2 \u2212 1) sin2 \u03c6 + c2b\n+\n\n\u0003\n\u0001\n\u0003\nMn\n\u03c502 \u0002 2 \u0002\n,\nln r 1 + \u03b2 2 \u2212 1 sin2 \u03c6 + c2h \u2212 p\n2\nr2 + c2n\n\n(1)\n\nwhere (r, \u03c6) are the usual polar coordinates. Equation (1) describes the motion of stars in a barred\ngalaxy with a disk, a halo, a massive nucleus and a strong nuclear bar (see below). Here Md , Mb\nand Mn are the masses of the disk, the bar and the nucleus respectively, while \u03b1, cb , ch and cn\nrepresent the scale lengths of the disk, the bar, the halo and the nucleus respectively. The strength\nof the nuclear bar is represented by the parameter b (b > 1), while the flattening parameter of the\nhalo is represented by the parameter \u03b2. Moreover, the parameter \u03c50 is used for the consistency of the\ngalactic units.\n\n\fOrder and Chaos in a Galactic Model with a Strong Nuclear Bar\n\n501\n\nIn the system of galactic units used in this article, the unit of length is 1 kpc, the unit of time is\n0.97746 \u00d7 107 yr and the unit of mass is 2.325 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 . The velocity and the angular velocity\nunits are 10 km s\u22121 and 10 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 respectively, while G is equal to unity. Our test particle\nis a star of unit mass (m = 1). Therefore, the energy unit (per unit mass) is 100 km2 s\u22122 . In these\nunits the values of the parameters involved are: \u03b1 = 8, \u03b2 = 1.3, b = 2, \u03c50 = 15, Md = 9500, Mb =\n3000, Mn = 400, cb = 1.5, cn = 0.25 and ch = 8.5. The values of the above dynamical parameters\nremain constant during this research.\nWe shall consider the case when the bar rotates clockwise, at a constant angular velocity \u03a9b . The\ncorresponding Hamiltonian, which is the well known Jacobi integral, in the rectangular Cartesian\ncoordinates (x, y) is\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1 2\n1\np + p2y + \u03a6(x, y) \u2212 \u03a92b x2 + y 2\n2 x\n2\n\u0001\n1 2\np + p2y + \u03a6eff (x, y)\n=\n2 x\n= EJ ,\n\nHJ =\n\n(2)\n\nwhere px and py are the momenta per unit mass, conjugate to x and y respectively and\n\u0003\nMd\nMb\n\u03c52 \u0002\n\u03a6eff (x, y) = \u2212 p\n\u2212p\n+ 0 ln x2 + \u03b2y 2 + c2h\n2\n2\nx2 + b2 y 2 + cb\nx2 + y 2 + \u03b12\n\u0001\nMn\n1\n\u2212p\n\u2212 \u03a92b x2 + y 2 ,\n2\n2\n2\n2\nx + y + cn\n\n(3)\n\nis the effective potential, while EJ is the numerical value of the Jacobi integral. If we expand the\neffective potential (3) in a Taylor series near the center, we shall obtain a potential describing local\nmotion.\nThe motivation of the present work is twofold: (i) to investigate the properties of global and\nlocal motion in the corresponding potentials. In particular, we shall express the coefficients of the\nlocal potential in terms of the global physical quantities entering the potential (3). A connection\nbetween the values of the global and the local energies will also be presented. (ii) to compare our\nnumerical results with those obtained in Paper P1, where we only had the nuclear bar, while the\nmassive nucleus was absent.\nThe present paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we study the properties of motion in the\nglobal model. The local potential, the connection between the local and the global parameters and\nthe properties of the local motion, are presented in Section 3. We close with a discussion and the\nconclusions of this research, which are given in Section 4.\n2 PROPERTIES OF MOTION IN THE GLOBAL MODEL\nIn Figure 1 we can see the contours of the constant effective potential (3). The value of \u03a9b is 1.25\nin the above mentioned galactic units. This value corresponds to 12.5 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 . One observes\nthat there are five stationary points, labeled L1 to L5 , at which\n\u2202\u03a6eff\n= 0,\n\u2202x\n\n\u2202\u03a6eff\n= 0.\n\u2202y\n\n(4)\n\nThese points are called Lagrange points. The central stationary point L1 is the minimum of \u03a6eff .\nAt the other four points L2 , L3 , L4 and L5 , it is possible for the test particle to travel in a circular\norbit while appearing to be stationary in the rotating frame. For this orbit, the centrifugal and the\ngravitational force precisely balance. The stationary points L4 and L5 on the x axis are saddle\n\n\f502\n\nEuaggelos E.

The values of all the parameters are\ngiven in the text. The five Lagrange points are labeled L1 to L5 .\npoints, while L2 and L3 are the maxima of the effective potential. The annulus bounded by the\ncircles through L2 , L3 and L4 , L5 is known as the \"region of corotation\" (see Binney & Tremaine\n2008). It is also important to note that the region of corotation in our dynamical system is located\nsomewhere in the outer parts of the galaxy.\nWe shall now proceed to study the properties of motion in the potential (3). We solve the equations of motion in the (x, y) plane for the potential (3) in which the nuclear bar rotates independently\naround the z axis. Assuming a clockwise rotation with a pattern angular velocity \u03a9b , one can write\nthe equations of motion in the form\nr\u0308 = \u2212\u2207\u03a6eff \u2212 2 (\u03a9b \u00d7 \u1e59) + |\u03a9b |2 r .\n\n(5)\n\nDecomposing into its x and y parts, we obtain\n\u2202\u03a6eff\n\u2212 2\u03a9b \u1e8f + \u03a92b x ,\n\u2202x\n\u2202\u03a6eff\n\u00ff = \u2212\n+ 2\u03a9b \u1e8b + \u03a92b y ,\n\u2202y\n\n\u1e8d = \u2212\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the dot indicates derivative with respect to the time.\nAll the numerical calculations are based on the numerical integration of the equations of motion (6), which was made using a Bulirsh-St\u00f6er routine in Fortran 95, with double precision in all\nsubroutines. The accuracy of the calculations was checked by the constancy of the Jacobi integral (2),\nwhich was conserved up to the eighteenth significant figure.\nIn order to visualize the properties of motion, we shall use the classical method of the x \u2212 px ,\ny = 0, py > 0 Poincar\u00e9 phase plane of the Hamiltonian (2). Figure 2 shows the structure of this phase\nplane for the global Hamiltonian (2), when EJ = \u2212570. The particular value of the energy EJ was\nchosen so that in the phase plane xmax \u2243 10. There are regular orbits, forming the \"right\" retrograde\nset of invariant curves, as well as a triple set of islands. Furthermore, one can identify several sets of\nsmaller secondary invariant curves embedded in the chaotic sea, which represent resonant orbits of\n\n\fOrder and Chaos in a Galactic Model with a Strong Nuclear Bar\n\n503\n\nFig. 2 The x \u2212 px Poincar\u00e9 phase plane for the global Hamiltonian (2), when EJ = \u2212570.\nThe values of all the other parameters are as in Fig. 1.\nhigher multiplicity. In addition to the regular region, there is a large unified chaotic domain formed\nby the chaotic orbits of the dynamical system. It is important to point out here that this chaotic area\nis obviously larger than that observed in the case in Paper P1, where the massive nucleus was absent.\nAlso note that the presence of the massive nucleus gives rise to a variety of secondary resonances. If\nwe set y = py = 0 in Equation (2), we obtain the limiting curve in the x \u2212 px phase plane, which is\nthe curve containing all the invariant curves for a given value of the Jacobi integral EJ . The limiting\ncurve which is the outermost curve shown in Figure 2 is defined by the equation\n1 2\np + \u03a6eff (x) = EJ .\n2 x\n\n(7)\n\nFigure 3(a)\u2013(f) shows six typical orbits of the global Hamiltonian system. The orbit shown in\nFigure 3(a) produces one of the \"right\" invariant curves. This orbit is a 1:1 resonant periodic orbit\nstarting at the stable retrograde periodic point and it is nearly circular. Such orbits support the disk.\nThe initial conditions are: x0 = 3.89, y0 = 0, px0 = 0. The orbit shown in Figure 3(b) produces\nthe set of the three outer islands in the phase plane of Figure 2. This periodic orbit belongs to the\nfamily of the 1:3 resonant orbits. We observe that the shape of this orbit is elongated and therefore it\nsupports the nuclear bar. The initial conditions are: x0 = 9.32, y0 = 0, px0 = 0. The orbit depicted\nin Figure 3(c) produces two of the three elongated islands of invariant curves which are embedded in\nthe chaotic sea. This periodic orbit is characteristic of the 3:5 resonance and it has initial conditions:\nx0 = \u22129.25, y0 = 0, px0 = 0. In Figure 3(d) one can see a typical example of a periodic orbit which\nbelongs to the family of 5:7 resonant orbits. The initial conditions are: x0 = \u22124.29, y0 = 0, px0 = 0.\nThe orbit shown in Figure 3(e) is a complicated periodic orbit characteristic of the 5:9 resonance and\nproduces a set of nine small islands of invariant curves inside the vast chaotic domain. This orbit has\ninitial conditions: x0 = \u22120.23, y0 = 0, px0 = 73. It is evident that the last four types of periodic\norbits and also the quasi-periodic orbits which belong to each family support both the disk and the\nbar structure of the galaxy. Finally, in Figure 3(f) we see a chaotic orbit with initial conditions:\nx0 = \u22127.9, y0 = 0, px0 = 0. The initial value of py0 was found in every case from the Jacobi\nintegral (2). All orbits shown in Figure 3(a)\u2013(f) were calculated for a time period of 100 time units.\n\n\f504\n\nEuaggelos E.

In order to visualize the nature of motion near\nthe nuclear region of our dynamical system, we present Figure 4 which shows the x \u2212 px , y = 0,\npy > 0 phase plane when EJ = \u22122700. Once more, the particular value of the energy EJ was\nchosen so that in the phase plane xmax \u2243 1. One observes a very interesting and complicated\nphase plane with regions of regular motion and a large, unified chaotic domain. In fact, there are\ntwo main regular regions consisting of invariant curves that are topological circles enclosing the\ntwo stable invariant points. The two stable invariant points D and R represent the direct (i.e. in the\nsame direction as the rotation) and the retrograde periodic orbits respectively. These periodic orbits\nare characteristic of the 1:1 resonance and are similar to ellipses circulating around the origin. The\nrest of the regular region consists of several sets of smaller islands of invariant curves produced\nby quasi-periodic orbits belonging to resonances of higher multiplicity. The chaotic domain shown\nin the phase plane of Figure 4 consists of a large, unified chaotic sea and sticky regions. It is well\nknown that the phenomenon of stickiness is common in barred galaxies (see Caranicolas & Karanis\n\n\fOrder and Chaos in a Galactic Model with a Strong Nuclear Bar\n\n505\n\nFig. 4 The x \u2212 px Poincar\u00e9 phase plane, when EJ = \u22122700. Details are given in\nthe text.\n1998; Karanis & Caranicolas 2002). The outermost curve shown in the phase plane of Figure 4 is\nthe limiting curve defined by H(x, px ) = EJ .\nComparing the present results with those given in Paper P1, we understand that the presence\nof the massive nucleus dramatically changes the nature of motion in our barred galactic model. In\nPaper P1, the motion was regular and there was only one kind of invariant curve. The invariant curves\nwere topological circles closing around the unique central invariant point. The corresponding orbits\nwere box orbits. The outer invariant curves belonged to elongated box orbits that support the bar,\nbut as we approached the central invariant point, the box orbits became more rectangular (see fig. 4\nof Paper P1 for more details). On the other hand, in the present case, we have resonant periodic or\nquasi-periodic orbits producing several sets of islands of invariant curves. Furthermore, the majority\nof the phase plane shown in Figure 4 is covered by chaotic orbits. We will return to this point later\nin the discussion.\nFigure 5(a)\u2013(j) shows ten typical orbits of the Hamiltonian system, when EJ = \u22122700.\nFigure 5(a) shows a periodic orbit starting at the position of the direct stable invariant point. This\norbit produces an invariant curve which belongs to the main set of invariant curves and encloses the\nfixed direct invariant point. The initial conditions are: x0 = \u22120.363, y0 = 0, px0 = 0. In Figure 5(b)\nwe see a typical example of a 1:2 resonant periodic orbit, which produces the set of the invariant\ncurves close to the limiting curve. This orbit has initial conditions: x0 = 0.51, y0 = 0, px0 = 32.8.\nThe orbit shown in Figure 5(c) produces the set of two small islands of invariant curves embedded\nnear the main set of invariant curves around the retrograde stable point. This orbit represents the 2:2\nresonance and has initial conditions: x0 = 0.152, y0 = 0, px0 = 0. The orbit depicted in Figure 5(d)\nproduces one of the islands of invariant curves that intersects the px axis. The initial conditions are:\nx0 = 0.018, y0 = 0, px0 = 38.6. In Figure 5(e) we see a 3:4 resonant orbit with initial conditions:\nx0 = 0.0756, y0 = 0, px0 = 24.5. Figure 5(f) shows a periodic orbit characteristic of the 3:5 resonance and produces a set of five small islands of invariant curves embedded in the chaotic region.\nThis orbit has initial conditions: x0 = 0.952, y0 = 0, px0 = 0. In Figure 5(g) one can observe a\ntypical 5:5 resonant periodic orbit. This orbit produces the set of the five small islands around the\ninvariant curves of the direct point and has initial conditions: x0 = \u22120.609, y0 = 0, px0 = 0.\n\n\f506\n\nEuaggelos E.

The initial conditions are: x0 = 0.797, y0 = 0, px0 = 0.\nIn Figure 5(i) we see a complicated periodic orbit characteristic of the 5:9 resonance, which produces a set of nine tiny islands embedded in the chaotic sea. The initial conditions of this orbit are:\nx0 = 1.025, y0 = 0, px0 = 0. Finally, in Figure 5(j) we see a chaotic orbit with initial conditions:\nx0 = 0.71, y0 = 0, px0 = 0. The initial value of py0 was found in every case from the Jacobi\nintegral (2). All orbits shown in Figure 5(a)\u2013(j) were calculated for a time period of 100 time units.\nWe have to point out that the nature of the local motion near the central region of the galaxy\nis much more complicated than the global motion. This can be justified by the fact that the phase\nplane shown in Figure 4 which corresponds to the local motion contains more resonant cases than\nthe phase plane of the global motion, which is shown in Figure 2. Therefore, we may conclude that\nthe presence of a massive nucleus near the galactic center gives rise to a large variety of resonant\norbits of higher multiplicity.\n3 PROPERTIES OF MOTION IN THE LOCAL MODEL\nThe local potential can be found by expanding the effective potential (3) in a Taylor series near the\ncentral stable Lagrange point L1 , which coincides with the origin. Following this procedure and\nkeeping only terms up to the fourth degree in the variables, we obtain the local effective potential\nwhich is\ni\n1h\n2\n2\nUeff (\u2206x, \u2206y) = Ueff (0, 0) +\nA (\u2206x) + B (\u2206y)\n2\ni\n1h\n4\n2\n2\n4\n\u2212 \u03b11 (\u2206x) + 2\u03b12 (\u2206x) (\u2206y) + \u03b13 (\u2206y)\n4\ni\n1 h\n2\n2\n\u2212 \u03a920 (\u2206x) + (\u2206y) ,\n(8)\n2\nwhere we have set\n\u03b1c2\nUeff = n \u03a6eff ,\n(9)\nMd\nin order to avoid large numbers.

Zotos\n\nAs one can see from Equation (11), the coefficients of the local effective potential are functions of\nthe physical quantities entering the global effective potential (3).\nThe local Hamiltonian is\nHL =\n\n\u0001\n1 2\npx + p2y + Veff (x, y) = hL ,\n2\n\n(12)\n\nwhere px and py are the local momenta per unit mass, conjugate to x and y respectively, while hL is\nthe numerical value of the local energy.\nIn order to connect the value of the global energy EJ with the value of the local energy hL ,\nwe proceed as follows. The equation EJ0 = \u03a6eff (0, 0) defines a point in the (x, y) plane, while\nEJ = \u03a6eff (x, y) defines a curve in the same plane. The global motion takes place inside this curve,\nwhich is known as the zero velocity curve. At the same time, hL0 = Veff (0, 0) defines a point in the\n(x, y) plane, while hL = Ueff (x, y) defines a curve inside which the local motion takes place. This\nsecond curve is the local zero velocity curve. We only consider bounded motion, which means the\nzero velocity curves are always closed. The local energy hL is connected to the global energy EJ\nthrough the relation\nhL = Ueff (x, y) \u2212 Ueff (0, 0) =\n=\n\n\u03b1c2n\n[\u03a6eff (x, y) \u2212 \u03a6eff (0, 0)]\nMd\n\n\u03b1c2n\n(EJ \u2212 EJ0 ) ,\nMd\n\nwhere\nEJ0 = \u2212\n\n\u0012\n\nMd\nMn\nMb\n+\n+\n\u03b1\ncb\ncn\n\n(13)\n\n\u0013\n\n+ \u03c502 ln (ch ) .\n\n(14)\n\nLet us now study the properties of the local motion. For the adopted values of the global parameters and for \u03a9b = 1.25, we find that: A = 1.4, B = 1.5, \u03b11 = 32.8, \u03b12 = 32.4, \u03b13 =\n32.8 and \u03a90 = 0.009. For the value of the global energy EJ = \u22122700 we find, by using\nEquation (13), that hL = 0.08452. It is amazing that this value of the local energy is much larger\nthan the energy of escape for the corresponding local potential (see Caranicolas & Varvoglis 1984;\nCaranicolas & Karanis 1998), which is given by\n\u00012\nB \u2212 \u03a920\nhesc =\n.\n(15)\n6\u03b11\nFor the above values of the parameters, Equation (15) gives the value hesc = 0.01196. This value\nis less than hL /7. Therefore, one may conclude that near the massive nucleus we do not have local\nmotion, or equivalently local orbits escape the nuclear region, because they possess a high value of\nlocal energy. In order to obtain an idea regarding the nature of the local motion near the nucleus, we\nmust go to very low values of energies, that is when h \u226a hL , where h is the value of the energy.\nFigure 6 shows the x \u2212 px , y = 0, py > 0 Poincar\u00e9 phase plane when h = 0.012. The motion\nis regular and the phase plane has all the characteristics of the 1:1 resonance. There are two stable\ninvariant points marked as D and R corresponding to direct and retrograde resonant periodic orbits\nrespectively. The unstable periodic point gives an orbit, which in the absence of rotation is the px\naxis. Thus, we observe that the local motion near the nucleus consists of a low energy 1:1 resonant\nperiodic orbit. Moreover, as the entire phase plane is covered with invariant curves corresponding\nonly to regular orbits, we conclude that near the nucleus we do not observe any kind of local chaotic\nmotion. This situation is completely different from that displayed in Paper P1, where the nucleus\nwas not present. In that case, all orbits in the local potential were box orbits, without any resonance\nphenomena.\n\n\fOrder and Chaos in a Galactic Model with a Strong Nuclear Bar\n\n509\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n0.05\n\n0\n\n0\n\nY\n\nY\n\nFig. 6 The x \u2212 px Poincar\u00e9 phase plane for the local Hamiltonian (12), when h = 0.012.\n\n-0.05\n\n-0.05\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.1\n-0.075 -0.05 -0.025\n\n0\nX\n\n0.025\n\n0.05\n\n0.075\n\n-0.075 -0.05 -0.025\n\n(a)\n\n0.025\n\n0.05\n\n0.075\n\n(b)\n0.15\n\n0.15\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n0.05\n\n0\n\n0\n\nY\n\nY\n\n0\nX\n\n-0.05\n\n-0.05\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.15\n\n-0.15\n-0.1\n\n-0.05\n\n0\nX\n\n(c)\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.05\n\n0\nX\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n(d)\n\nFig. 7 (a)\u2013(d): Four typical orbits in the local Hamiltonian (12), when\nh = 0.012.\nFigure 7(a)\u2013(d) shows four orbits of the local Hamiltonian (12). Figure 7(a) and (b) show two\nperiodic orbits starting at the direct and the retrograde periodic points respectively. The initial conditions for the orbit shown in Figure 7(a) are: x0 = \u22120.0845, y0 = 0, px0 = 0, while for the orbit\nshown in Figure 7(b) are: x0 = 0.0885, y0 = 0, px0 = 0. In Figure 7(c) we observe an orbit starting\nat the unstable periodic point with initial conditions: x0 = \u22120.0119, y0 = 0, px0 = 0. Finally,\nin Figure 7(d) we see a box orbit which produces one of the outer invariant curves shown in the\nphase plane of Figure 6. The initial conditions for this orbit are: x0 = 0.1425, y0 = 0, px0 = 0.\nThe initial value of py0 was found in every case from the energy integral (12).

It is obvious that this value of the local\nenergy does not have any physical meaning if all the relations (16) are not satisfied.\nIn order to better estimate the degree of chaos displayed by the chaotic orbits shown in Figures 2\nand 4, we decided to compute the maximum Lyapunov Characteristic Exponent (L.C.E.) (for details\nsee Lichtenberg & Lieberman 1992). The results are shown in Figure 8. The curve labeled G shows\nthe evolution of the L.C.E. for a chaotic orbit with initial conditions in the chaotic region of Figure 2.\nThe particular values of the initial conditions of this orbit are as in Figure 3(f). On the other hand,\nthe curve labeled L shows the evolution of the L.C.E. for a chaotic orbit with initial conditions in\nthe chaotic region of Figure 4. The particular values of the initial conditions of this orbit are as in\nFigure 5(j). We observe that the value of the L.C.E. corresponding to the local system of Figure 4 is\nabout ten times the value of the L.C.E. corresponding to the global system of Figure 2. Therefore,\none can say that in this case we have not only fast chaos (see Caranicolas & Vozikis 1987), where\nthe L.C.E. was on the order of unity, but also very fast chaos where the L.C.E. is about three times\nlarger. It is evident that this is an indication of strong nuclear activity near the vicinity of the galactic\ncenter.\n4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nOne of the most important approaches in order to understand and reveal the dynamical behavior\nof a galactic system is based on the knowledge of the chaotic versus ordered nature of orbits.\nIn the present research, we tried to achieve this using a global and a local potential describing a\nbarred galaxy with a massive nucleus, a disk and prolate halo components. The corresponding local potential was found by expanding the global potential around the central stable Lagrange point,\nwhich coincides with the origin, in a Taylor series and keeping only terms up to the fourth degree\nin the variables. This local potential is a potential made up of a two-dimensional perturbed harmonic oscillator. The study of the motion in those potentials has been an active field of research\n\n\fOrder and Chaos in a Galactic Model with a Strong Nuclear Bar\n\n511\n\nover the last decades (see for examples Sait\u00f4 & Ichimura 1979; Innanen 1985; Caranicolas 1984,\n1994, 2000; Caranicolas & Karanis 1999; Caranicolas & Vozikis 2002). In later years, the study of\nthe properties of motion in those dynamical systems has been explored in detail, using precise and\nmodern analytical (see Elipe 2000, 2001; Elipe & Deprit 1999) or numerical (see Lara et al. 1999;\nKaranis & Caranicolas 2002) methods.\nAs expected, the local parameters and the corresponding local energy are functions of all the\ninvolved global parameters and the global energy. Our numerical experiments, in the global dynamical system for high values of the energy, suggest that more than 62% of the tested orbits are chaotic.\nComparing the outcomes with those of Paper P1 we see that, in the present case, we have a sharp\nincrease of the total chaotic motion. It is evident that the chaotic domain in Figure 2 is much more\nextended. This means that the additional nucleus affects not only the region near the center of the\ngalaxy, but also areas far from it. Another interesting observation is that the presence of the nucleus\ndoes not seem to affect the figure-eight quasi-periodic orbits, which are the building blocks of the\nbarred structure of the galaxy. This result agrees with recent observations made by the Hubble Space\nTelescope, which revealed that a number of Seyfert galaxies display strong nuclear barred structure\n(see Regan & Mulchaey 1999). On the other hand, the global motion near the massive nucleus has\nthe characteristic of a 1:1 resonance. Furthermore, the chaotic domain seems to be larger than that\nobserved in Figure 2. This is natural because of the presence of the nearby massive nucleus. All the\nabove results are completely different from the corresponding results obtained in Paper P1, where\nthe motion was regular and all the orbits in the global system near the galactic center were box orbits.\nThe effect of a central mass concentration (CMC) on the phase space of global galactic models\nhas already been studied extensively in several earlier research works (see Caranicolas & Zotos\n2011; Zotos 2012). Hasan & Norman (1990) have shown that a black hole or a CMC in a barred\ngalaxy can dissolve the barred structure. Moreover, the fundamental orbits of the system (called\nB orbits), supporting the bar, are orbits elongated in the direction of the bar. As the black hole's\nmass increases, an inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) appears and moves outward. Thus, the B orbits\ndisappear when the ILR reaches the end of the bar. This effect is significantly increased if the bar\nis thinner. Orbits that stay closer to the central mass, with smaller Jacobi constants, can change\ntheir character from regular to chaotic more easily. Furthermore, the study of Hasan et al. (1993)\nindicates that, as the mass of the CMC increases, the stable regular orbits in the region where the bar\npotential competes in strength with the central mass potential, especially around the region of the\nILR, will no longer be present and their position will be occupied by chaotic orbits. Shen & Sellwood\n(2004) have conducted a systematic study of the effects of CMC on bars, using high quality N -body\nsimulations. They have experimented with both strong and weak initial bars and a wide range of\nthe physical parameters of the CMC, such as the final mass, the scale length and the mass growth\ntime. Their outcomes suggest that, for a given mass, compact CMCs (such as super-massive black\nholes) are more destructive to barred structures than are more diffuse ones (such as molecular gas\nclouds in many galactic centers). They have shown that the former are more efficient scatterers\nof bars supporting regular elongated orbits, that pass close to the galactic center and, therefore,\ndecrease the percentage of the regular orbits and increase the area of the chaotic region in the phase\nspace. All the above research outcomes are in agreement with the present findings, which strongly\nindicate that the massive nucleus is a very important parameter of the dynamical system, since it is\nresponsible not only for the chaotic motion of low energy stars but also for the several resonant orbits\nof higher multiplicity that appear in the local model. In particular, Figures 2 and 4 in the current paper\nremarkably resemble the Poincar\u00e9 surface of section plots in figure 11 of Shen & Sellwood (2004),\nwhere a realistic self-consistent barred model was adopted.\nLet us now consider the local motion. The local potential (10) has all the characteristics of the\n1:1 resonance. Such potentials are known as perturbed elliptic oscillators (see Deprit 1991). It is\nvery interesting that for the corresponding local energy given by Equation (13), the local motion\nis not bounded. In order to obtain bounded motion, one must approach very low values of local\n\n\f512\n\nEuaggelos E. Zotos\n\nenergies. Strictly speaking, the presence of the massive nucleus makes the local energy increase\ndramatically, so that considering all the zero velocity curves results in unbounded local motion. For\nvalues of local energies slightly lower than the value of the energy of escape, we observe resonance\nphenomena, namely the 1:1 resonant periodic orbits. Extensive numerical calculations in the local\npotential suggest that chaotic motion was not observed.\nBearing all the above in mind, we can say that this situation is entirely different from that investigated in Paper P1, where the properties of local motion were the same as those of the global motion\nnear the galactic center (see figs. 4 and 5 in Paper P1). In our case, the corresponding local motion\ndoes not appear to exist and only very low energy local motion seems to be present. Furthermore,\nthe fact that the corresponding value of the L.C.E., which was computed in the chaotic domain near\nthe nuclear region, is much larger than unity suggests that there is a particular and strong activity in\nthe central parts of galaxies with strong nuclear bars.\nWe consider this paper to be an initial effort in order to explore and reveal the dynamical structure of the system in more detail. As the present results are positive, further investigation will be\ninitiated to study all the available phase space. Moreover, our gravitational model will be suitably\nmodified, in order to be able to describe the properties of motion in a Hamiltonian galactic system\nof three degrees of freedom.\nAcknowledgements The author would like to express his thanks to the anonymous referee for the\ncareful reading of the manuscript and for his very useful suggestions and comments, which improved\nthe quality of the present work.\nReferences\nBinney, J., & Tremaine, S. 2008, Galactic Dynamics: Second Edition (Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ.
