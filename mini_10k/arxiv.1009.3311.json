These findings are in agreement with\nexperimental observations on Sr2 IrO4 , and qualitatively different from those of extensively studied\n3d Mott insulators.\nPACS numbers: 71.30.+h, 75.25.Dk, 71.20.-b\n\nTransition metal oxides have been one of the most fascinating classes of materials in recent years [1]. For the\npast decays, tremendous amount of efforts have been devoted to explore the nature of 3d transition metal oxides where various exotic states and phenomena have\nemerged such as high-Tc cuprate superconductors, colossal magneto-resistant manganites, multiferroics, and various magnetic orders. It has been established that these\nstates and phenomena are caused by strong Coulomb\ninteractions along with cooperative interactions of spin,\ncharge, and orbital degrees of freedom, which are basically separable in 3d electrons [2].\nVery recently, 5d transition metal oxides have attracted\nmuch attention as a candidate of a novel Mott insulator.\nBecause of the extended nature of 5d orbital, Coulomb\ninteractions are expected to be smaller for 5d electrons\n(\u223c 1\u20133 eV) than for 3d electrons (\u223c 5\u20137 eV) [3], whereas\nthe spin-orbit coupling (SOC) \u03bb is estimated to be considerably larger in 5d (\u223c 0.1\u20131 eV) than in 3d (\u223c 0.01\u20130.1\neV). Therefore, in 5d transition metal oxides, inherently\nspin and orbital degrees of freedom are strongly entangled.\nOne of such examples is the layered 5d transition metal\noxide Sr2 IrO4 . In Sr2 IrO4 , t2g and eg orbitals are well\nseparated by the large crystal field, and the lower t2g\norbital is filled with five electrons, (t2g )5 . In spite of\nthe large band width and small on-site Coulomb interaction U , Sr2 IrO4 is an antiferromagnetic insulator with a\nweak ferromagnetic moment [4, 5]. Neutron diffraction\npatterns do not detect any superlattice structure that indicates charge order or charge density wave states [6]. It\nis proposed that the strong SOC is responsible for the\ninsulating mechanism [7]. Indeed, the 4d counterpart of\nSr2 RhO4 , which has a larger U and a smaller \u03bb than\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: h-watanabe@riken.jp\n\nSr2 IrO4 , is metallic [8].\nThe proposed picture of this \"spin-orbit-induced\"\nMott insulator in Sr2 IrO4 is as follows. The SOC\nz\n=\nsplits the t2g orbitals into Jeff = 1/2 states (Jeff\nz\n\u00b11/2, twofold degenerate) and Jeff = 3/2 states (Jeff\n=\n\u00b11/2, \u00b13/2, fourfold degenerate). Here Jeff denotes the\n\"effective\" total angular momentum derived from the\nlarge SOC with the large crystal field [7]. When the SOC\nis large enough, the lower Jeff = 3/2 state is fully filled\nand the upper Jeff = 1/2 state forms an active half-filled\nenergy band. The band width of this half-filled band\n(Weff ) is much smaller than the original one without the\nSOC (W ) as shown in Fig. 1(a), and thus even small U\ncan lead the system into a Mott insulator. This picture\nof \"Jeff = 1/2 Mott insulator\" is supported by several\nexperiments such as resonant x-ray scattering [9], angle\nresolved photoemission spectroscopy [7], and optical conductivity [7]. This novel Mott insulator has a quite different character than 3d Mott insulators where the effect\nof the SOC is only perturbative and thus the spin and\norbital are essentially separate objects. Although this\npicture is supported by first-principle calculations based\non the density functional theory [7, 11], a study treating many-body effects beyond the mean-filed level is still\nlacking. The main purpose of this paper is to understand\nthe nature of Mott insulator induced in spin-orbital entangled 5d systems.\nHere, we study the novel Mott transition and magnetic order induced by the SOC for Sr2 IrO4 . The ground\nstate properties of the three-orbital Hubbard model with\na SOC term are investigated with the variational Monte\nCarlo (VMC) method. We show that the large SOC\nworks cooperatively with U and leads the system into\na novel Mott insulating state with an in-plane AF order.\nWe also calculate the one-particle excitation spectrum using the variational cluster approximation (VCA) [12] to\ndiscuss the difference between the \"spin-orbit-induced\"\nMott insulator and the 3d Mott insulator.\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Schematic picture of the splitting of density of\nstates by the SOC.

Here, \u03c3 indicates electronic spins and the indices \u03b1 and \u03b2 represent three t2g orbitals, yz (1), zx (2),\nand xy (3).\nThe kinetic and SOC terms can be combined (H0 =\nHkin + HSO ) in the matrix form,\nH0 =\n\nFirst, we construct the non-interacting tight-binding\nenergy band. In Sr2 IrO4 , and also in Sr2 RhO4 , there\nis a large hybridization between the xy and x2 \u2212 y 2\norbitals originated from the tilting of IrO6 octahedra.\nBecause of this hybridization, the xy orbital is pushed\ndown below the Fermi energy [10]. To take into account\nthe effect of this hybridization, we introduce the nextnearest and third-nearest hopping integrals in the xy orbital. The chemical potential \u03bc3 is also introduced to\ntake account of both the hybridization and tetragonal\nsplitting [11]. The resulting energy dispersion of the xy\norbital is \u03b53 (k) = \u22122t1 (cos kx +cos ky )\u22124t2 cos kx cos ky \u2212\n2t3 (cos 2kx + cos 2ky ) + \u03bc3 . On the contrary, the yz\nand zx orbitals have almost one-dimensional character,\n\u03b51 (k) = \u22122t5 cos kx \u22122t4 cos ky and \u03b52 (k) = \u22122t4 cos kx \u2212\n2t5 cos ky (t4 \u226b t5 ). Using this form, the band dispersion\nof Sr2 IrO4 calculated by the LDA+SO (spin-orbit) [7] is\nwell reproduced by choosing the tight-binding parameters with (t1 , t2 , t3 , t4 , t5 , \u03bc3 , \u03bb)=(0.36, 0.18, 0.09, 0.37,\n0.06, -0.36, 0.37) eV, as shown in Fig. 1(c). In the\nfollowing, we set t1 = t as an energy unit. To study\nthe Mott transition and the role of the SOC, we only\nchange the value of \u03bb and fix the other tight-binding parameters. This assumption is justified by the fact that\nthe LDA+SO band dispersion for the 4d counterpart of\nmetallic Sr2 RhO4 [14] is well reproduced by choosing\n\u03bb/t \u223c 0.5 with the other parameters fixed.\nNext, we examine the effect of Coulomb interactions.\nFor this purpose, the following trial wave function is considered,\n\n\u0011\nX\u0010 \u2020\nck1\u03c3 , c\u2020k2\u03c3 , c\u2020k3\u2212\u03c3\nk\u03c3\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\u03b51 (k) i\u03c3\u03bb/2 \u2212\u03c3\u03bb/2\nck1\u03c3\n\u00d7 \uf8ed\u2212i\u03c3\u03bb/2 \u03b52 (k) i\u03bb/2 \uf8f8 \uf8ed ck2\u03c3 \uf8f8 , (2)\n\u2212\u03c3\u03bb/2 \u2212i\u03bb/2 \u03b53 (k)\nck3\u2212\u03c3\n\uf8eb\n\nfrom which it is apparent that the SOC mixes the up- and\ndown-spin states, and new quasiparticles are obtained\nsimply by diagonalizing H0 . The new quasiparticles are\ncharacterized by the pseudo-orbital \u03b1 and pseudo-spin \u03c3\nwith a creation (annihilation) operator a\u2020k\u03b1\u03c3 (ak\u03b1\u03c3 ). In\nthe atomic limit (\u03b51 (k) = \u03b52 (k) = \u03b53 (k) = 0), sixfold\ndegenerate states are split into twofold degenerate Jeff =\n1/2 states and fourfold degenerate Jeff = 3/2 states [7].\n\n(3)\n\n|\u03a6i is the one-body part obtained by diagonalizing\nH0 with renormalized (variational) tight-binding parameters, H\u03040 (t\u0303i , \u03bc\u03033 , \u03bb\u0303\u03b1\u03b2 ). Note that by the effect of\nCoulomb interaction and tetragonal splitting, the \"effective\" coupling constant of the SOC has orbital dependence: \u03bb \u2192 \u03bb\u0303\u03b1\u03b2 . To consider magnetically ordered\nstates, a term with the different magnetic order parameter is added to H\u03040 . Here, we study the out-of-plane\nAF order (along z axis) and in-plane AF order (along\nP\nx axis), described by \u2206z eiQ*ri (a\u2020i\u03b1\u2191 ai\u03b1\u2191 \u2212 a\u2020i\u03b1\u2193 ai\u03b1\u2193 )\nP\nand \u2206x eiQ*ri (a\u2020i\u03b1\u2191 ai\u03b1\u2193 + a\u2020i\u03b1\u2193 ai\u03b1\u2191 ), respectively. Here\nQ = (\u03c0, \u03c0) is an ordering vector. Note that the staggered\nfield is applied to newly formed quasiparticles in the real\nspace (ai\u03b1\u03c3 , a\u2020i\u03b1\u03c3 ) and \u03c3 represents the pseudo-spin, not\nthe original spin.

(3) is a charge Jastrow factor that controls the longrange charge correlation. The long-range charge correlation is known to be important for describing Mott transition [16]. In this study, we assume that vij depends\nonly on the distances, vij = v(|ri \u2212 rj |). For instance,\nwe consider up to 19th-neighbor correlation for a 10\u00d710\nsquare lattice, and therefore the number of independent\nvariational parameters vij is 19.\nThe ground state energy and other physical quantities are calculated with the VMC method.\nThe\nvariational parameters mentioned above are simultaneously optimized by using the stochastic reconfiguration\nmethod [17]. This method makes it possible to optimize\nmany parameters efficiently and stably.\nFig. 2(a) shows the obtained ground state phase diagram for a 2D 10\u00d710 square lattice with the electron\ndensity n = 5, corresponding to (t2g )5 , and the Coulomb\ninteractions U \u2032 /U = 0.7 and J/U = 0.15. The transition\nfrom the paramagnetic metal to the AF insulator occurs\nat U = UMI , which depends sensitively on the value of \u03bb.\nThis metal-insulator transition (MIT) is found to be firstorder, indicating that the nesting of the Fermi surface is\nnot perfect and the Coulomb interaction is essential in\ndriving the transition. The insulating mechanism is understood as follows. When the staggered (AF) field is\napplied, the degeneracy along the edge of the AF Brillouin zone (along M-X in Fig. 1) is lifted and the highest\nband is split off by the AF gap [Fig. 1(d)]. As can be\nseen in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c), the SOC lifts upward the two\nbranches of the energy bands from the rest, which makes\nit easier to fully open the AF gap once the Coulomb interactions are considered. Namely, the larger the SOC\n\nis, the easier the system becomes the AF insulator. Indeed, Fig. 2(a) shows that UMI monotonically decreases\nwith increasing \u03bb. Moreover, we found that the effective\ncoupling constant \u03bb\u0303\u03b1\u03b2 increases with U , indicating that\nU and \u03bb work cooperatively for insulating.\nWe expect that this insulating mechanism found above\nis applied for Sr2 IrO4 . Because the Coulomb interaction\nUIr is much smaller than the band width, the metallic\nstate is naively expected for Sr2 IrO4 . However, Sr2 IrO4\nis experimentally found insulating with a canted AF order [9]. This counter-intuitive observation can be explained if the SOC in Sr2 IrO4 , \u03bbIr , is large enough to\nreduce UMI smaller than UIr . Indeed, \u03bbIr is estimated as\nlarge as 0.4\u20130.5 eV, which is much larger than the values for 3d and 4d electron systems. We consider that\nUIr > UMI is satisfied and the \"spin-orbit-induced\" Mott\ninsulator is realized in Sr2 IrO4 . On the other hand, in\nSr2 RhO4 , we consider that URh < UMI is satisfied and\nthus the metallic state is realized. The expected locations of Sr2 IrO4 and Sr2 RhO4 in the phase diagram are\nindicated in Fig. 2(a), where both of them are located\nnear the MIT point. Note that the observed insulating\ngap of Sr2 IrO4 is very small (\u223c 0.1 eV), suggesting that\nthe system is in the vicinity of the MIT point. It is also\ninteresting to notice that a small amount of substitution\nof Ir (\u223c 10%) for Rh in Sr2 RhO4 leads to the MIT [18],\nindicating that the system is located not far from the\nMIT point.\nThe J/U dependence of UMI is also investigated and\nthe results are shown in Fig. 2(b). It is clearly seen in\nFig. 2(b) that UMI monotonically increases with increasing J/U , indicating that the Hund's coupling is unfavorable for the spin-orbit-induced Mott insulator. This\nbehavior is naturally understood since the Hund's coupling competes with the SOC and works destructively\nfor the formation of the quasiparticles originated from\nthe SOC. It is, however, found that the overall shape of\nthe phase diagram does not change qualitatively with increasing J/U except for UMI shifting to a larger value.\nFor J/U =0.15\u20130.25, we estimate UMI =1.2\u20131.6 eV for\nSr2 IrO4 and 1.6\u20132.4 eV for Sr2 RhO4 .\nIn the insulating region, we found that the in-plane\nAF order (x-AFI) is more stable than the out-of-plane\nAF order (z-AFI). If there is no Hund's coupling [J = 0\nin Eq. (1)], the rotational symmetry in pseudo-spin space\nis preserved and z-AFI and x-AFI are energetically degenerate. However, the introduction of Hund's coupling\ninduces the anisotropy and the in-plane AF order is more\nfavored than the out-of-plane AF order. This result is\nconsistent with the study of an effective strong SOC spin\nmodel by Jackeli and Khaliullin [19]. The magnetic xray diffraction experiment [9] also supports the in-plane\nmagnetism in Sr2 IrO4 .\nWe have also estimated the local magnetic moment\nas large as 0.3\u20130.4\u03bcB for the parameters appropriate\nfor Sr2 IrO4 . This value is comparable to the results of\nmagnetic susceptibility measurements [5, 20] and much\nsmaller than the atomic value of 1 \u03bcB in the strong-SOC\n\n\f4\n\n\u03c1(\u03c9)\n\n0.08 (e)\n0.06\n0.04\n\nAll\nJeff=1/2\nz |=1/2\nJeff=3/2, |Jeff\nz |=3/2\nJeff=3/2, |Jeff\n\n0.02\n0 -3.5 -3 -2.5 -2 -1.5 -1 -0.5 0 0.5 1\n\n\u03c9 (eV)\n\nFIG. 3: (color online).

The parameters used are U =1.44 eV, U \u2032 =1.008\neV, J=0.216 eV, and \u03bb=0.432 eV, and \u03c9 = 0 corresponds to\nthe Fermi energy.\n\nlimit. This large reduction is due to the large itinerancy\nof 5d electrons. If we assume that the magnetic moment\nexactly follows the tilting of IrO6 octahedra observed experimentally (\u223c 11\u25e6 ) [4], the expected ferromagnetic moment is 0.05\u20130.07\u03bcB, which is comparable to the experimental estimation [4, 5, 20].\nFinally, to explore the internal electronic structure in\nthe insulating state, the one-particle excitation spectrum\nis calculated using the VCA [21]. The results are shown\nin Fig. 3 for a set of parameters appropriate for Sr2 IrO4 .\nAs seen in Fig. 3(a), the Fermi energy is located inside\nthe gap, and thus the state is insulating. The validity of\nthe physical picture of \"Jeff = 1/2 Mott insulator\" can\nbe examined by projecting the spectrum onto Jeff = 1/2\n[Fig. 3(b)] and Jeff = 3/2 [Figs. 3(c) and 3(d)] states\ndefined in the atomic limit. It is clearly seen in Fig. 3\nthat the upper (unoccupied) band is well described by\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n\nM. Imada et al., Rev. Mod. Phys. 70, 1039 (1998).\nY. Tokura and N. Nagaosa, Science 288, 462 (2000).\nM. Taguchi, private communications.\nM. K. Crawford et al., Phys. Rev. B 49, 9198 (1994).\n\nJeff = 1/2 state. On the other hand, the lower (occupied) band is a mixture of Jeff = 1/2 and Jeff = 3/2\nstates and can not be simply compared with the atomic\nlimit. For example, the bands with Jeff = 3/2 character\nare located closer to the Fermi energy for all momenta\nexcept for the vicinity of the AF Brillouin zone boundary\n(M-X) [Figs. 3(b) and (d)]. In this sense, the low-lying\none-particle excitations are slightly different from the picture of \"Jeff = 1/2 Mott insulator\" where the Jeff = 1/2\nand Jeff = 3/2 states are well separated and the former\nforms the lowest-lying upper and lower Hubbard bands.\nThis difference is attributed to the large itinerancy of 5d\nelectrons.\nFig. 3(e) shows the total density of states calculated\nusing the VCA. As indicated by the arrow in Fig. 3(e),\nthe optical excitation is expected mainly at around 1 eV\noriginating from \u223c \u22120.5 eV to \u223c 0.5 eV with a broad\nwidth due to a large band width of the occupied states.\nIndeed, a moderate peak structure is observed at around\n1 eV in the optical conductivity measurement [9], which is\nin good agreement with our calculations. In addition, the\nexperiment has observed a rather sharp peak at around\n0.5 eV. This sharp peak may be explained by the excitation from the lower Jeff = 1/2 state to the upper\nJeff = 1/2 state along the AF Brillouin zone boundary\n(M-X), indicated by the arrows in Fig. 3(b), where the\nalmost parallel bands expect to induce a sharp excitation\n(\u223c 0.5 eV).\nIn conclusion, we have shown that the SOC plays\nan important role in determining sensitively the critical\nvalue of UMI as well as the nature of the resulting Mott\ninsulating phase in Sr2 IrO4 . This is because the 5d Mott\ninsulator, not like for 3d systems, is well described by\nthe novel quantum number Jeff , which is due to the large\nSOC along with the large crystal field, a generic feature\nfor the 5d transition metal oxides. Therefore, we expect\nthat not only U but also \u03bb are crucial factors to be considered in describing MIT for the 5d systems in general.\nMoreover, because of the orders of magnitude different \u03bb,\nother novel quantum phenomena, such as the anomalous\nmetallic state, multipole order, and unconventional superconductivity that are not observed in the 3d systems,\nare expected to emerge in the 5d systems.\nThe authors thank Y.
