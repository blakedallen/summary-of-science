The phase diagram is studied using grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation. Simulations of dynamical phenomena are made using the canonical ensemble. We find\ninteresting order-disorder transitions in the equilibrium phase diagram and identify several anomalous regimes of diffusivity. These phenomena may be relevant to the case of strong orientational\nbonding near freezing.\n\nDynamical arrest [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature, with many manifestations. Well\nknown examples include conventional glasses [7, 8, 9],\nbut in modern condensed matter studies the range of\nsystems where the issues have become relevant is remarkable. Thus, dynamical arrest is now believed to be a useful description for gellation [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], 'solidification', glassification [7, 8, 16, 17], jamming [18, 19, 20]\nand the ergodic-to-non-ergodic transition. Recent work\ntends to indicate that scientists increasingly see these\nphenomena as manifestations of a single underlying set\nof principles [12, 18, 20, 21, 22].\nNumerous attempts have been made to study simple models to develop ideas of dynamical arrest [9, 23,\n24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]. Two approaches have\nbeen prominent in recent years, exemplified by the KobAndersen kinetically constrained models [32, 33], and\nHamiltonian-type models such as that introduced by\nBiroli and M\u00e9zard (BM). This model, introduced in\nRef. [3], permits particles of any given type i to have\na number of neighbors less than or equal to a prescribed\nnumber, ci . If ci is equal to the coordination number of\nthe lattice, we have a lattice gas model, elsewhere the\nmodel is believed to be an attempt to represent packing\nconstraints [1, 3, 34]. The relationship between these two\ndifferent kinetic models has never been fully explored,\nthough there has been a tendency to conclude that they\nare quite similar in spirit.\nIn this paper we extend the concept of a Hamiltonian\nmodel to include 'soft' repulsions, rather than simply\nhard constraints. Thus, we now stipulate that ci neighbors of a given type have zero energy and additional particles have a repulsive energy \u01eb(i) (in our case chosen to\nbe V0 ). Clearly, as we pass to the limit of infinite repulsions we expect to recover the original BM model. In\nwhat will follow the reader may assume that this is indeed\nthe case, though that limit is not explicitly shown. Here\nwe focus on this generalization and in particular two of\nits applications. Firstly, it gives additional insights into\nthe mechanisms involved in the dynamical arrest of such\nmodels and secondly, such models may be applicable to\nsystems with oriented bonding effects.\n\nIn the work discussed below, we have calculated phase\ndiagrams using the grand canonical Monte Carlo method.\nThe initial configurations of these models are obtained\nby slowly annealing in the repulsions from a random lattice gas configuration. Since we form crystals for a large\nportion of the phase diagram, such annealing procedures\nmay sometimes have to be optimized over long periods\nof time. Phase transition curves are typically determined\nfrom system sizes of L = 12, though in some cases larger\nsizes have been used to study particular transitions. After annealing, equilibration times of \u03c4 = 2000 MCS\n(Monte Carlo Sweeps) and averaging times of 100, 000\nMCS have been used. Again, some specific areas of the\nphase diagram have been studied with averaging times of\nseveral millions sweeps.\nThe dynamical studies, from which we calculate the\nmean squared distance traveled ( r2 ) and consequently\nthe single-particle diffusion constant (D), are based on\na single step canonical Monte Carlo approach. In this\nmethod, random movements are proposed and the conventional Metropolis procedure used to choose successful\nmoves. We have checked that both the known lattice gas\n[35] and BM limits are faithfully reproduced.\nIn Fig 1 we present results for the simplest single component system (c = 3) model. The phase diagram for this\nsystem is quite striking. A 'crystalline' region is bounded\nby first-order transitions on the low density side by the\ngas and on the high density side by the fluid. Apart from\nthe special density \u03c1 = 32 where the crystal is perfectly\npacked, the crystalline state contains many defects and\nwith the present level of simulation and theory it is not\npossible to establish that it possesses true long ranged order. Hence we have referred to this state as 'crystal'. The\nfirst-order phase-transition curves from gas and fluid to\nthe crystal terminate at high temperature with a regime\nin which the crystal passes to the fluid. The restricted\nresolution of simulation prohibits us from deciding if this\nis a short curve of weak first-order phase-transitions, or\na single point of second order (critical) transitions. We\nconsider, on quite general grounds that either is possible. In the inset to Fig 1 we show the heat capacity as\none crosses (by lowering temperature) the transition near\n\n\f2\n3\n\n\u22c4\n\u22c4\n\u22c4\n\u22c4\n\u22c4\n\u22c4\u22c4\n\u22c4\u22c4\n\u22c4\n\u22c4\n\u22c4\n\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\n\n\u22b3\n\u22b3\u22b3\n\u22b3\n600\n\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\nCv\n\u22c4\n\u22b3\nkB\n\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4 \u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4 \u22c4\n\u22c4\n\u22c4\n400\n\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\n\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4 \u22c4 \u22c4 \u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\n\u22c4 \u22c4\u22c4\n\u22b3\u22b3\n\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\n\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\n\u22b3\n\u22c4\n\u22b3\n\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\n200\n\u22b3\u22b3\n\u22c4\u22c4\n\u22b3\u22b3\n0.8 0.85 0.9 0.95 1\n\u22b3\u22b3\n\u22c4\u22c4\n\u22b3\n\u22b3\n\u22c4\n\u22c4\nkB T\n\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\nV0\n\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\n\u22c4 \u22c4\n\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\n\u22c4\u22c4\n\u22b3\n\u22b3\n\u22c4\n\u22b2\n\u22b3\u22b3\n\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\n\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\n\u22b2\u22b2\u22b2\n\u22c4\u22c4\nF\n\u22b3\u22b3 \u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\n\u22b3\n\u22b3\n\u22c4\n\u22b3\n\u22c6\u22c6\u22c6\u22c6\u22c6\n\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u22c4\u22c4 \u22c6 \u22c6 \u22b3\u22c6\u22b3\u22b3 \u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\n\u22b2 \u22b2\u22b2\u22b2\n\u00d7\u00d7\n\u22b3 \u22c6\u22c6\n\u22c6\n\u00d7 \u00d7\n\u22b2 \u22b2\u22b2\u22b2 \u22b2 \u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n\u22c6\n\u22b2\n\u22b2\n\u00d7\n\u22b2\n\u00d7\n\u22c6\n\u00d7\n\u22b2\n\u22c6\n\u22b2\n\u00d7\u00d7\n\u22c6\n\u00d7\n\u22c6\u22c6\u22c6\u22b2 \u22b2 \u22b2\u22b2 \u22b2\n\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n\u00d7\n\u22c6\u22c6\n\u22c6\u22c6 \u25e6 \u25e6\u25e6\u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6\u25e6 \u25e6\u25e6\u25e6 \u25e6\u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u22c6\nC\nF\n\u00d7\n800\n\n2.5\n2\nkB T\nV0\n\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n\nstructured fluids composed of molecules that have strong\ndirectional bonding in the solid.

The density difference\nbetween gas or fluid appears to be nearly continuous, as\nillustrated in the two-phase-regions of the phase diagram.\nIf indeed the transition were to be continuous, the topology of the phase diagram and form of the heat capacity\nsuggest that it would be a lambda-like transition [36].\nThe apex of the envelope of phase-transitions appears\nto occur precisely at that density at which the crystal is\nperfectly packed (\u03c1 = 23 ). At higher or lower density (and\ntemperatures lower than this apex) the crystal has either\nan excess of particles or a deficit of particles leading to\nvacancies. This point is illustrated in Fig 2. The low\ndensity crystal (2(a)) has extra vacancies in the particlefilled layers, whereas the high density crystal (2(b)) has\nextra particles in the 'empty' layers. The defect density\ntherefore vanishes on approach to this special point, at\ndensity \u03c1 = 32 . Furthermore, at this highest temperature\nthe (free) energetic cost of these defects is vanishing. It\nis therefore unclear whether the true order parameter of\nthe transition is the Fourier transform of the periodic\ndensity of the crystal (as would be usual [37, 38]) or the\ndefect density. This is connected to the uncertainty in\nthe nature of that transition.\nThe equilibrium phase diagram is reminiscent of many\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 2: Samples of crystalline lattices at densities above and\nbelow the \"critical\" density (\u03c1c = 23 ). The black spheres\nrepresent an occupied position on the lattice and the white\nones represent a vacancy. Fig. 2(a) (\u03c1 = 0.6424) shows hole\ndefects within the occupied layers. Fig. 2(b) (\u03c1 = 0.6811)\nshows particle defects within the vacant layers.\n\nWe now study dynamical slowing across the phase diagram. For infinite repulsions there is a transient slowing\n[1, 3, 34] that for some conditions or mixtures appears\nto be a near-arrest transition. For the infinite repulsion\ncase the onset of this phenomenon always lies within the\ncrystal regime and therefore competes with crystallization. It is interesting to ask if there is any true arrest\nfor finite energy, or higher density. The answer we have\nobtained for this model is, at first sight, a little surprising. The transient phenomenon present at infinite repulsion is barely appreciable for any finite repulsion and in\nthe higher density re-melted regime significant dynamical slowing (and indeed arrest) occurs only near the fully\nfilled lattice limit in which the system is close packed.\nThus, even at very low temperatures, where the repulsions become very large, providing the density is sufficiently high that the crystal melts there is no arrest.\nHowever, it is interesting that the diffusivity is nonmonotonic in density or temperature. We have studied\nthe diffusion constants along a series of iso-chemical potential curves (\u03b2\u03bc = 6.0, 9.0, 15.0, 20.0). These are given\nin Fig 1 and the diffusion constants along these curves\nare given in Fig 3. In each case the diffusion constant\nrises to a maximum as the temperature is lowered, decreasing for yet lower temperatures. In the equivalent\ndensity representation it is clear that there is a band\n\n\f3\n3\n\nkB T\nV0\n\n\u22c4\n\u22b3\n\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\n\u22b3\u22b3\n\u22c4\n\u22b3\u22b3\n\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4 \u22c4\n2.5\n\u22c4\u22c4\n\u22b3\u22b3\n\u22b3\n\u22c4\u22c4\n\u22c4 \u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\n\u22b3\n\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\n\u22c4\n\u22c4 \u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\n\u22b3\u22b3 \u22b3\u22b3\n2\n\u22c4 \u22c4\n\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\n\u22c4\u22c4\u22c4 \u22c4\n\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\n\u22c4\n\u22b3\u22b3\n\u22b3\u22b3\n\u22c4\u22c4 \u22c4\n\u22b3\u22b3 \u22b3\n1.5\n\u22c4\u22c4\n\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\n\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\n\u22c4\n\u22c4\u22c4\n\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\n\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\n\u22b2\n\u22c4\u22c4 \u22c4\n\u22b3\u22b3\n\u22b3\u22b3\n\u22b3\u22b3 \u22c4\u22c4 \u22c4\u22c4\u22c4\n1 \u22b2 \u22b2 \u22b2 \u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3 \u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\n\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\u22b2 \u22b2\u22c4 \u22c4\u22b2\n\u22b2\n\u22b2\n\u22c4\u25e6\u25e6 \u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\u22b3\n\u22b2 \u22b2\n\u22b2 \u22b2 \u22b2 \u22b2\n\u22c4 \u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6 \u25e6\u25e6 \u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n\u22b2 \u22b2 \u22b2 \u22b2\u22b2\n\u25e6 \u22b2 \u25e6\u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6\u25e6 \u25e6\u22b2\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n\u25e6\n0.5 \u22b3\u22c4\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6\u25e6\n\u22c4\n\u22c4\n\u22c4\n0\n0\n0.005\n0.01\n0.015\n0.02\n0.025\n0.03\nD\n\nFIG. 3: Diffusion Constant (D) vs Temperature ( kVB0T ) for a\nset of constant chemical potentials, \u03b2\u03bc = 6.0, 9.0, 15.0, 20.0\nmarked \u22c4, \u22b3, \u22b2, \u25e6 respectively. The peaks in the \u03b2\u03bc = 15, 20\ncurves illustrate the anomalously high diffusion at high density and low temperature.\n\nof anomalously high diffusivity in the high density fluid\n(re-melted) regime of the phase diagram. The reasons\nfor this are quite interesting and are related to the issue\nof defects in the crystalline state. They merit a short\ndiscussion.\nAt high density, as the fluid re-melts there develops\na small population of particles that cannot find a location where their three-bond limit is satisfied. This is\ntrue even of the crystal, as noted earlier. Thus, in the\nfluid, the density exceeds that limit at which every bond\nnumber is satisfied. While it is true that these particles\nare unfavorable with respect to energy, they are equally\nunfavorable no matter where they are located in the system. They can therefore move with ease and become\n'super-fast' diffusing particles. As the density increases\nthe number of such particles increases, conferring greater\nmobility to the system. At yet higher density the repulsive energy is overcome, the system becomes similar\nto the lattice gas and the diffusion constant decreases\ndue to the limited numbers of spaces into which particles\ncan move. This phenomenon is sufficiently general that\nit may be expected to occur in the remelted regimes of\nstructured fluids.\nFrom a more general perspective we note that there is\nno significant dynamical arrest phenomenon in the dense\nfluid, the diffusion constant vanishing only at the close\npacked limit (lattice gas). We may conclude that the\nblocking effects that lead to the transient near-arrest\nphenomena in the infinite energy version of this model\nare strongly associated with the crystalline region itself.\nThat is, when the forces are sufficient (and the density\nhigh enough) to destabilize the crystal, dynamical arrest\nbecomes less, not more likely.\nIn future it may be important to explore more care-\n\nfully the mechanisms of these hamiltonian and kinetic\narrest models to see if indeed there are more substantive\ndifferences that have hitherto not been recognized.\nWe acknowledge remarks from G.
