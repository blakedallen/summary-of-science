In the former case, such\ngalaxies present an observational challenge for hierarchical models of structure formation, as some form of feedback is required to suppress on-going star formation in\nsuch massive systems (see Wake et al. (2006) and references therein). For cosmology, such massive ellipticals can\nbe used to directly constrain cosmological parameters (e.g.,\nas standard candles; Collins & Mann (1998)) and provide efficient tracers of the Large Scale Structure (LSS) in the Universe (Eisenstein et al. 2001). Moreover, the (relative) ages\nof massive ellipticals, as a function of redshift, offers the possibility of directly constraining the Hubble parameter, thus\nproviding vital information on the expansion history of the\nUniverse and therefore, the equation of state of dark en-\n\nergy (see ? for a discussion of the underlying concept, and\nJimenez et al. (2003); Simon et al. (2005) and Stern et al.\n(2009) for observational constraints obtained from using this\ntechnique).\nIn this paper, we revisit the techniques used to constrain\ncosmological parameters through the age\u2013redshift relationship of passive (elliptical), massive galaxies. In detail, we\npresent a new analysis of the ages of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs; Eisenstein et al. (2001)), as selected from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. (2000)). The\nkey difference present herein compared to other such work\nwith SDSS spectral data (e.g. Bernardi et al. (2003a,b);\nEisenstein et al. (2003); Bernardi et al. (2006)) is that we\ncalibrate, for the first time, the SDSS spectra onto the wellknown, and well-studied, Lick/IDS system (Burstein et al.\n(1984); Worthey et al. (1994)), thus allowing us to exploit\na host of previous work on this system including the Simple Stellar Population (SSP) modeling in the literature\n\n\f2\n\nDan P. Carson and Robert C. Nichol\n\n(Worthey (1998); Maraston (1998); Korn et al. (2005)) and\ncomparisons with Lick measurements in the literature. In\na companion paper, we will use the age\u2013redshift data derived for SDSS LRGs in this paper to obtain cosmological\nconstraints.\nIn Section 2 of this paper, we outline the SDSS galaxy\ndata we use to construct our age\u2013redshift relation, specifically luminous (massive), quiescent galaxies. We also discuss\nthe stellar data available to calibrate these galaxies onto the\nLick/IDS system (see also Appendix A). In Section 3, we\nprovide details about the SSP models we have used to determine the ages, metallicities and \u03b1\u2013enhancements of our\ngalaxies, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique for parameter estimation. We discuss our results in\nSection 4, including the effect of priors, and conclude in Section 5. Appendix A provides the extensive details on how\nwe calibrate the SDSS spectra onto the Lick/IDS system,\nincluding all the necessary corrections made to the data. In\nAppendix B, we provide a review of tests we have performed\nto quantify the robustness of our spectral measurements, including comparisons with data from the literature. We assume a concordance, flat \u039bCDM cosmology, with h = 0.7\nand \u039b = 0.7, where required.\n\n2\n\nSAMPLE SELECTION\n\nThe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000;\nStoughton et al. 2002; Abazajian et al. 2003) is a photometric and spectroscopic survey, covering \u2243 8000deg2 of the\nnorthern sky, using a 2.5 meter telescope at Apache Point\nObservatory in New Mexico, USA. The photometric survey\nconsists of simultaneous observations of the sky using 5 optical filters (u, g, r, i and z ), providing a database of hundreds\nof millions of detected objects all with accurate photometric\nand astrometric calibrations (Pier et al. 2003; Lupton et al.\n2001; Hogg et al. 2001).\nThe SDSS spectroscopic galaxy survey consists of two\nsamples of galaxies selected using different criteria; namely\nthe MAIN sample (Strauss et al. 2002) and the LRG sample\n(Eisenstein et al. 2001). The SDSS spectra of these galaxies\nspan a wavelength range of 3800 < \u03bb < 9200\u00c5 with a median\nresolution of R \u223c 1800 (R \u2261 \u03bb/\u2206\u03bb), which is approximately\n3 \u00c5 (although this varies as a function of wavelength and is\ndifferent for each fiber). The SDSS spectra are automatically\nreduced using dedicated software, which flux calibrates the\nspectra and references them to the heliocentric frame and\nconverts to vacuum wavelengths. The software also measures a redshift for each object and measures a series of\nspectral features consistent (in their wavelength definitions)\nas the standard Lick indices (see Section 2.2), but are not\ncalibrated onto the Lick systems as no attempt has been\nmade to match to the resolution of the Lick/IDS system.\nFor the analysis presented in this paper, we do not\nuse the Lick indices measurements from the standard SDSS\npipeline, but instead determine our own line-strengths after\nmatching the instrumental resolutions (see Section A). However, we do use redshifts (z), velocity dispersions (velDisp),\nmagnitudes (u,g,r,i,z) and other derived quantities such\nas the r -band de Vaucouleurs radii (deVRad r) and the r band de Vaucouleurs profile axis ratio (deVAB r) from the\nstandard SDSS spectral pipeline, made available through\n\nthe Catalog Archive Server (CAS)1 . The spectral data used\nin this paper was obtained from the Data Archive Server\n(DAS)2 .\n\n2.1\n\nSDSS Luminous Red Galaxies\n\nFor our analysis, we only used Cut I Luminous Red\nGalaxies (LRGs) as outlined in (Eisenstein et al. 2001).\nThis is achieved by selecting objects from CAS using the\nTARGET GALAXY RED flag, thus yielding a pseudo volumelimited sample of LRGs between 0.15 < z < 0.35. Below\nz = 0.15 contamination by low redshift star-forming galaxies\nincreases the space density of galaxies that satisfy the SDSS\nLRG colour-colour selection, while above z = 0.35 the space\ndensity of SDSS LRGs decreases due to the 4000 \u00c5 break\ndropping out of the SDSS g-band. We do not use the Cut\nII LRG sample at z > 0.4 as we require velocity dispersion\nmeasurements for each object and these are not supplied\nabove this redshift. Therefore, we impose an upper redshift\nlimit of z = 0.4 in our sample and analysis.\nWe further restrict our sample to only include LRGs\nwith specClass EQ 'SPEC GALAXY' (spectrum classified as\na galaxy), zStat EQ 'XCORR HIC' (redshift obtained from\ncross-correlation with a template), zWarning EQ 0 (no\nwarning flags on the redshift), eClass < 0 (indicates an\nold stellar population), z < 0.4 (redshift less than 0.4)\nand fracDev r > 0.8 (indicating a surface brightness profile\nbest fit by a de Vaucouleurs profile). Based upon these selection criteria, we obtain a sample of approximately 77, 000\nLRGs (see Figure 2 for the redshift distribution of this sample).\n\n2.1.1\n\nQuiescent Galaxies\n\nAt low redshift, our sample will be contaminated by bulges\nin late-type galaxies due to the fiber size (3\u2032\u2032 ) of the SDSS\nspectrographs. To reduce this contamination, and increase\nthe number of truly quiescent galaxies in our sample, we\nmake further cuts based on the emission line properties of\nour LRG sample, e.g., we use standard emission lines such as\nH\u03b1, H\u03b2 and [O III]\u03bb5007 (Fukugita et al. 2004; Zhao et al.\n2006; Roseboom et al. 2006). If left unchecked, such nebular emission, or emission associated with low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) activity, would confuse\nour interpretation of the SSP parameters derived from these\nobjects.\nTo combat this, we use the MPA-JHU spectral line\ndata3 to select only those objects that are consistent\nwith zero emission. In their original work, Tremonti et al.\n(2004) fitted the spectral energy distributions (SEDs)\nof Bruzual & Charlot (2003) to the SDSS galaxy spectra in Data Release Four (DR4), subtracted off the best\nfitting SED, and then measured the line-strengths of\n[O II]\u03bbair 3726, H\u03b2 , [O III]\u03bbair 5007, [N II]\u03bbair 6584, H\u03b1 and\n[S II]\u03bbair 6717. This SED fitting approach has now been applied to the SDSS Data Release Seven (DR7) dataset using\n\n1\n2\n3\n\nhttp://www.sdss.org/dr7/access/index.html#CAS\nhttp://www.sdss.org/dr7/access/index.html#DAS\nhttp://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/SDSS/DR7/raw data.html\n\n\fThe age-redshift relationship for SDSS LRGs\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. Distribution of the line-strengths from the MPA-JHU dataset for the LRGs of our sample. Dotted contours show the full LRG\nsample while solid lines show the quiescent sample selected based on their H\u03b1 and [O II] line-strengths. While only two lines have been\nused in the production of the quiescent sample, all lines show distributions consistent with zero-emission.\n\nthe stellar population synthesis spectra of Charlot & Bruzual\n(2008). We use this latest DR7 dataset herein.\nIn an approach similar to Yan et al. (2006) we fit a\ntwo component function to the line-strength distributions\nof Tremonti et al., that consists of a normal component to\ndescribe the quiescent LRGs, plus a log-normal component\nto describe the active objects. The best fit is then used to determine the small zero-point offsets that exist in the dataset\nof Tremonti et al. from which we then select objects that\nare consistent with zero emission, at the 2\u03c3 level, in H\u03b1 and\n[O II], hence removing the need to make corrections to the\nLick index line-strengths for the possible presence of nebular emission. With these constraints on the emission-line\ncharacteristics of the LRG sample, we obtain approximately\n35, 000 galaxies that we refer to as the quiescent LRG sample.\nWhile it is possible to use different, and more, emission\nlines in determining the quiescent sample, doing so results\nin a significant reduction of our sample size. For instance,\nincluding H\u03b2 and [O III] in the joint constraint with H\u03b1 and\n[O II] yields approximately 28, 000 LRGs over 0.0 < z < 0.4\nand further inclusion of [N II] and [S II] constraints yields\napproximately 19, 000 objects. While the more restrictive\nsample selection ensures a more quiescent sample, the reduction in the total number of objects available hampers\nour ability to explore the evolution of the SSP parameters\nover the desired redshift range. But, even selecting on H\u03b1\nand [O II] alone helps to ensure that we are not including\nobjects with significant emission in H\u03b2 as show in Figure 1.\nIn Figure 2 we also show the redshift distribution of the\nquiescent LRGs sample.\n\n2.1.2\n\nFurther Selection Criteria\n\nIn order to select the same population of objects over\nthe redshift range 0.0 < z < 0.4 we need to select\non physical properties such as velocity dispersion and\nabsolute luminosity. Aperture corrections are applied to\nthe SDSS velocity dispersion measurements following the\napproaches of J\u00f8rgensen et al. (1995) and Bernardi et al.\n(2003a), see Section A5. To select on luminosity we have\nperformed K-corrections using the code kcorrect code of\n\nFigure 2. Redshift distribution of our LRG sample (solid line)\nand our quiescent sample (dashed line).\n\nBlanton & Roweis (2007) and have K-corrected all galaxies to a redshift of 0.2 (the median of our distribution) in\norder to minimise errors in these K-corrections.\nWe have modeled the luminosity evolution in our LRGs\nusing a simple linear fit to the volume limited part of the Kcorrected, magnitude-redshift distribution and then extrapolated this to higher and lower redshifts, see Figure 3. From\nthis, we obtain an evolutionary (e) correction which we apply to our quiescent LRG sample. A more detailed approach\nto determine the evolution correction using stellar population synthesis models is unlikely to significantly improve the\naccuracy of the e-correction given the difficulty that current\nmodels have in explaining the evolution of the SDSS LRGs\ncolours (Wake et al. 2006; Maraston et al. 2009).\nWhen reporting absolute magnitudes, we will use the\nnotation M0.2r to denote r-band SDSS magnitudes that have\nbeen K+e corrected such that the r-band has been shifted\nto z = 0.2.\nAfter correcting velocity dispersions for aperture effects\nand performing K+e corrections to the magnitudes, we have\n\n\f4\n\nDan P.

The region bounded by\nthe vertical dotted lines represent the volume-limited portion of\nour sample and the (red/dashed line) shows the median luminosity in redshift intervals of \u2206z = 0.01.\n\nproduced four subsamples of quiescent LRGs (see Table 2 for\nnumbers in each sample). These subsamples span an intervals of \u2206M0.2r = 0.6 and \u2206\u03c3v = 30 km s\u22121 and are shown as\nthe boxed regions in Figure 4. Objects satisfying these criteria are then co-added to produce high signal-to-noise spectra\nafter binning into redshift intervals of \u2206z = 0.02. This redshift interval is small enough that there is little evolution\nin the ages of the objects within the bin such that we are\nco-adding objects of sufficiently similar ages, e.g. in the case\nof a concordance cosmology the age evolution within a bin is\napproximately 0.2 Gyr over the redshift range 0.0 < z < 0.4,\nand is big enough to yield a sufficient number of objects to\nreach S/N levels of approximately 100 \u00c5 \u22121\nIn generating the co-added spectrum we have adopted\nan approach similar to Bernardi et al. (2006). Briefly, after\nbinning our sample in redshift, absolute magnitude and velocity dispersion we shift each spectrum to its restframe. All\nspectra in a given bin are normalised to the median flux in\nthe region 4500 \u2212 5500 \u00c5 and combined pixel-by-pixel using\na weighted arithmetic mean where the weights are determined by the inverse variance of the flux in each pixel. This\napproach means that not all spectra contribute equally to\nthe co-added spectrum but it does mean that those pixels\ncontaminated by residuals from imperfect sky-subtraction\ncontribute less to the final stacked spectrum.\n2.2\n\nLick/IDS System\n\nA long term programme undertaken by Burstein et al.\n(1984); Faber et al. (1985); Worthey et al. (1994) and\nTrager et al. (1998), amongst others, has yielded a library of\nstellar spectra, obtained with the Image Dissector Scanner\n(IDS, Robinson & Wampler 1972) on the Shane 3m telescope at the Lick Observatory. These authors have also es-\n\ntablished a spectral index system used to investigate element\nabundances from low-resolution integrated spectra of extragalactic stellar populations.\nTwenty five absorption features in the wavelength range\n4000 < \u03bb < 6000 \u00c5 at \u223c 9 \u00c5 resolution, have been identified that are sensitive to effective temperature (Teff ), surface\ngravity (g) and metallicity (Z) of a star. The wavelength definitions of these features were chosen such that the broad absorption features found in elliptical galaxies could be studied\nand to minimise the effect of galaxy velocity dispersion on\nthe measured line-strengths.\nAll features measured on the Lick/IDS system are defined by a central \"feature\" bandpass and two adjacent\n\"pseudocontinuum\" bandpasses, see Appendix A. From this\ncontinuum and feature it is possible to measure a \"pseudo\"\nequivalent width (EW). It is not a true EW as the wavelength definitions for the bandpasses are fixed and, depending on the element abundances, instrumental resolution or\nvelocity dispersion of the stellar population, the wings of an\nabsorption feature may extend beyond the feature bandpass.\nAs a consequence of adopting fixed wavelengths to determine the continuum and feature fluxes, the measured linestrength depends on the flux in the continua bandpasses\nas well as the feature bandpass. The continua also contain\nabsorption features which, when coupled to the effects of\ngalaxy velocity dispersions and instrumental resolution, will\nhelp suppress its average flux.\nOther factors that effect the measured line-strength\nof absorption features are gas, dust and telluric features.\nAlthough dust has little effect due to the generally narrow nature of the features, gas can be a problem. Nebular emission will contaminate the measured line-strength\nof the Balmer lines by filling in the \"natural\" absorption\n(Moore et al. 2002, and references therein) and, when using\nthe H\u03b2 absorption index, will lead to incorrectly determining older ages for stellar populations. While the H\u03b2 index\nline-strength is directly affected by Balmer emission from\nionized gas, some indices are indirectly affected by emission,\ne.g. the red sideband of Mg b can be contaminated by [N i]\n(Goudfrooij & Emsellem 1996).\nTelluric emission and absorption can also have a significant impact on the accuracy of the measured line-strengths,\nbut stacking spectra in order to improve the S/N of the Lick\nindices also allows us to minimise the impact from these telluric features. By co-adding spectra at different redshifts,\ntelluric features \"appear\" at different restframe wavelengths\nin the deredshifted spectra. Using the inverse variance of the\nflux when weighting each pixel allows us to minimise the impact from these features on the final stacked spectrum.\nIt should be noted that the SDSS convention is to\npresent all wavelengths as vacuum wavelengths. Therefore, the wavelength definitions of all Lick Indices were\nconverted to vacuum wavelengths (Morton 1991) prior to\nperforming any measurements of index line-strengths on\nspectra. We have used the publicly\u2013available software INDEXF4 (Cardiel 2007) to measure our absorption feature\nline-strengths from our co-added stacked LRG spectra.\n\n4\n\nhttp://www.ucm.es/info/Astrof/software/indexf/indexf.html\n\n\fThe age-redshift relationship for SDSS LRGs\n\n5\n\nFigure 4.

Contours show the distribution in number density of the whole sample, and are in the intervals 1,10,50,100. The four boxes\nare the same in each panel and show the boundaries used to create the four mass (velocity dispersion) samples used in Section 4 when\nexploring the redshift evolution of the SSP parameters for the quiescent sample.\n\n2.3\n\nLick Stars in the SDSS\n\nTo properly calibrate to the Lick/IDS system it is necessary\nto have SDSS observations of Lick stars, or galaxies, to allow\nthe zero-point offsets to be determined, see Appendix A1.\nThe library of Lick stars that could be used in calibrating\nthe SDSS to the Lick system have not been intentionally\ntargeted by the SDSS and therefore requires serendipitous\nobservations of Lick stars to allow the SDSS to be placed on\nthe Lick system.\nThe diameter of the SDSS fibres is 3.0\u2032\u2032 with the median\nseeing at Apache Point of \u223c 1.5\u2032\u2032 . We have therefore chosen\na cut-off of < 1.5\u2032\u2032 when matching SDSS objects and Lick\nstar coordinates. In searching for Lick stars in the SDSS we\nhave included both special and survey plates in the search\nand have identified 13 stars from the Lick library that match\nSDSS objects to within 1.5\u2032\u2032 ; 11 stars in M67 (special plate #\n0321) and 2 stars in NGC 7789 (special plate # 2377) and are\nlisted in Table 1. The cluster proper motion dispersion for\nM67 is \u223c 0.8 mas yr\u22121 (McNamara & Sanders 1978) and for\nNGC 7789 is \u223c 0.4 mas yr\u22121 (McNamara & Solomon 1981),\nwith only one star in Table 1 having a measured proper\nmotion of \u223c 9.0 mas yr\u22121 for M67 F 164 (Hog et al. 1998).\nGiven the small size of the proper motions we have ignored\nthis effect when matching the coordinates of SDSS objects\nto the Lick stars in these two clusters.\nThe details of how our SDSS LRG spectra were calibrated onto the Lick/IDS system using the Lick stars in\nTable 1 is given in Appendix A.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nMETHOD\nSimple Stellar Population Models\n\nSimple stellar population (SSP) models have become an invaluable tool in allowing the physical properties of stellar\npopulations to be probed via measurements of absorption\nfeatures in their integrated spectra. But absorption features\ngenerally suffer from the same age-metallicity degeneracy\nthat effects the interpretation of star formation histories and\nchemical evolution of stellar population using their broad-\n\nTable 1.

Balmer lines become weaker while\nmetallic line become stronger as the age and metallicity of\na stellar population increases.\nWhile different absorption features behave differently\nto age and metallicity, with some more sensitive to age and\nothers to metallicity, a further complication is that due to\n\u03b1-enhancement. Worthey (1998) has shown that regardless\nof isochrones, stellar library, fitting functions or authors,\nthe SSP models at the time were unable to explain the\nlarge spread in Mg at fixed Fe of ellipticals. This overabundance of Mg is considered to be a consequence of the different timescales involved in the evolution of stars of different\nmasses. The abundance of the \u03b1-elements (O, Ne, Mg, Si\namongst others), which are primarily a product of nucleosynthesis in Type II supernovae, is enhanced over the the\nabundance of the Fe-peak elements (Fe, Cr amongst others)\nthat result from Type Ia supernovae. The ages and metallicities derived for SSPs differ depending on whether an \u03b1element or Fe-peak element is used to represent metallicity\n([Z/H] ).\nSince elliptical galaxies show an enhancement of \u03b1element over Fe-element abundance, it has become necessary\n\n\f6\n\nDan P. Carson and Robert C. Nichol\n\nto employ SSP models that account for these effects. In this\nwork we use the SSP models of Korn et al. (2005, hereafter\nKMT05) which use the Evolutionary Population Synthesis\n(EPS) scheme of Maraston (1998, hereafter M98) and the\nmethod of Thomas et al. (2003, hereafter TMB03) to produce the line-strengths of the Lick indices for stellar populations with variable element abundance. In KMT05, the\nauthors use model stellar atmospheres to produce synthetic\nstellar spectra from which they compute line-strengths and\nfrom this, index response functions as a function of metallicity. They then use the scheme of TMB03 to produce Lick\nindex line-strengths that account for variable [\u03b1/Fe] ratios.\nThese models have been calibrated on globular clusters that\nare known to have enhanced [\u03b1/Fe] ratios above the solar\nvalue.\n\n3.2\n\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo\n\nDifferent authors have employed different strategies when\nconverting between the observed line-strengths in galaxy\nspectra and the model parameters (Mehlert et al. 2003;\nde la Rosa et al. 2007). However, most previous techniques\nhave involved interpolating a grid of model index values at\nthe location of the observed index values for the object in\nquestion. Since the KMT05 models have three SSP parameters, this requires that one of the parameters needs to be\nfixed and there is normally an iterative procedure employed\nto explore the parameter space. At each iteration, a new set\nof model grids are generated and the observed index values\nare used to re-generate the appropriate SSP parameters. In\norder to determine the correct SSP parameters for the observed index line-strengths, multiple model index grids may\nbe used. Moreover, each author may have a different convergence criteria for these iterations such that the same SSP\nparameters need to be reproduced with different index-index\ngrids and are consistent to a pre-determined level.\nIn this work, we explore an alternative methodology,\nwhich is based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\ntechnique to perform the iterative minimisation in order to\nobtain the SSP parameters that correspond to the measured\nindex line-strengths of the object under study. In the context of Bayesian inference, the MCMC process produces a\nrandom sequence of dependent variables that are drawn directly from the posterior distribution which is achieved using\nBayes' Theorem:\np(\u03b8|y) = R\n\np(y|\u03b8)p(\u03b8)\np(y|\u03b8)p(\u03b8)d\u03b8\n\n,\n\nthe posterior distribution. This form of MCMC uses a candidate generating, or proposal, distribution to propose new\nlocations in parameter space which allows the likelihood surface to be explored. During this exploration the proposed\nnew locations are accepted or rejected based on logical criteria embodied in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.\nWhile the form of the candidate-generating distribution does not impact on the ability of the MetropolisHastings algorithm to reach a stationary distribution, it does\nimpact on the efficiency of the convergence to stationarity (Doran & M\u00fcller 2004). The most efficient candidategenerating distribution to adopt would be that of the posterior distribution, but this is not known a priori. In our\nimplementation we adopt a multivariate normal distribution as our candidate-generating distribution and estimate\nthe covariance matrix from the data itself.\nConvergence to the stationary distribution is idenb\ntified through use of the Gelman-Rubin R-statistic\n(Gelman & Rubin 1992) with convergence identified when\nb 6 1.1 (Verde et al. 2003) for each parameter of the model.\nR\nIdentifying convergence allows the \"burn-in\" phase to be\nexcluded from the chain and accurate estimation of the\nconfidence-intervals on the model parameters.\n\n3.3\n\nIn order to use the SSP models of KMT05 with our MCMC\napproach we adopt a trilinear interpolation scheme, since\nthe models have three parameters (age, metallicity and \u03b1iron ratio), such that the SSP models can be investigated\nat an arbitrary location in parameter space. While there is\na unique mapping from model parameters to index values,\nthere is no unique mapping from index values to model parameters and therefore the models cannot be inverted. We\nmust therefore use multiple Lick indices simultaneously in\norder to break this degeneracy.\nThe Metropolis-Hastings algorithm employs a likelihood ratio test in order to determine acceptance or not of\na candidate position in parameter space. The likelihood\n(L \u2261 p(y|\u03b8)) is obtained by assuming that the data, y,\nis a set of N independent normally distributed random\nvariables, yi , i = 1, . . . , N (Cowan 1998). Each yi has a\ndifferent and unknown mean, \u03bci , but known variance,\n\u03c3i2 . The joint p.d.f. is the product of these N normal\ndistributions:\n\n(1)\n\nwhere p(\u03b8|y) is the posterior probability density and assigns\na probability to the model, \u03b8, given the data, y, and any\nprior knowledge concerning the model. The probability density p(y|\u03b8) is associated with obtaining the data given the\nvector of model parameters and is also called the likelihood\n(L). The marginal probability density, p(\u03b8), describes the\nprobability associated with the parameter vector and encompasses any prior knowledge of the model parameters.\nThe denominator in the above expression can be considered\na normalisation factor and is ignored in our implementation.\nWe implement the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm\n(Metropolis et al. 1953; Hastings 1970) to ensure that the\nstationary distribution of the Markov chain samples from\n\nLikelihood Estimation\n\nL=\n\nN\nY\ni=1\n\n\u221a\n\n1\nexp\n2\u03c0\u03c3i\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212(yi \u2212 \u03bci )2\n2\u03c3i2\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the true values, \u03bci , depend on the model parameters,\ni.e. \u03b8 = (\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8m ).

If\nthe next step is rejected then the current step is re-saved as\npart of the chain.\nThe chain now performs a random walk in parameter space and generates the sequence of parameter samples\n{\u03b81 , \u03b82 , . . . , \u03b8n , \u03b8n+1 }. Once the chain has converged to the\nstationary distribution, i.e. burned in, the random walk will\nbe confined to the vicinity of the global mode in the posterior\ndistribution. In Appendix B we test this method of SSP parameter estimation by comparing with previously published\nresults from Thomas et al. (2005, hereafter TMBO).\n\n4\n4.1\n\nRESULTS\nLine Strengths\n\nThe relationship between the line-strength and redshift for\nthe four different mass (velocity dispersion) samples, defined\nin Figure 4, are presented in Figure 5 for a selection of the\nkey Lick indices used in age-dating of galaxy spectra (again\nsee Appendix for details of how the SDSS spectra were calibrated onto the Lick system). These relationships are consistent with that of a passively evolving stellar population, i.e.\nthe strength of H\u03b2 and H\u03b3F indices increase with redshift\nwhile the Mg b and hFei lines decrease in strength, indicated\nby the dotted line in each panel.\nThe scatter in these relationships is consistent with\nthe error on a typical line-strength and there is a clear\ntrend with velocity dispersion, i.e. Mg b and hFei show\na positive correlation with velocity dispersion while H\u03b3F\nshows a negative correlation. These trends are consistent\nwith the finding from other authors, e.g. Bender et al.\n(1993); Kuntschner et al. (2001); Bernardi et al. (2003b);\nLoubser et al. (2009). While there is no obvious segregation of the H\u03b2-redshift relationships there is a hint that\nthe 260 < \u03c3v 6 290 km s\u22121 (circles/green) sample yields\nline-strengths that are systematically larger than the 320 <\n\u03c3v 6 350 km s\u22121 (diamonds/pink) sample, consistent with\nthe negative correlation observed by other studies.\n\n4.2\n\n7\n\nSSP Parameter Estimates - Uniform Priors\n\nUsing the H\u03b3F , Mg b and hFei data in Figure 5 and\nthe parameter estimation method outlined in Section 3\nwe determine the SSP parameters for each mass sample\nand the results are shown in Figure 6. These parameter\nestimates have been obtained using uniform priors that\ncover the full parameter space of the KMT05 models, i.e.\nage (Gyr) \u223c U(0.31, 18.2), [Z/H] \u223c U(\u22121.0, 0.97), [\u03b1/Fe] \u223c\nU(\u22120.25, 0.73), when computing the posterior probability\nusing Equation 1, and then estimating the 16, 50 and 84\npercentiles from the posterior distribution for each parameter after marginalising over the remaining parameters. In\nthe rest of this paper, the median is used to define the \"location\" and the 16 and 84 percentiles the 1\u03c3 error on SSP\nparameters.\nThe evolution in [\u03b1/Fe] with redshift is somewhat confusing as the low (blue triangles) and high (pink diamonds)\nmass (velocity dispersion) samples exhibiting significant\nscatter and may not be consistent with a constant value\nover the entire redshift range (there is some indication for a\nchange in behaviour at z > 0.35). The intermediate mass\nsamples (green circles and red squares) are more stable\nand exhibit no significant gradient, as expected for galaxies that are not chemically evolving. There does however\nappear to be a positive correlation between velocity dispersion and [\u03b1/Fe] which is consistent with other studies, e.g.\nThomas et al. (2005).\nThe evolution in [Z/H] with redshift is also consistent\nwith a chemically unevolving population of objects, although the lowest mass sample does exhibit a significant\ngradient. The metallicity also exhibits a significant positive\ncorrelation with velocity dispersion, where the more massive\nobjects have higher metallicity, again consistent with other\nstudies. Finally, the evolution in age with redshift exhibits\nthe expected behavior; galaxies become younger with redshift, with a trend that suggests the most massive objects\nare, in fact, the youngest.\nWhile the H\u03b2 and H\u03b3F trends are consistent with tracing a passively evolving population, it is not possible to obtain consistent estimates of the SSP parameters using these\nindices. The dotted line in Figure 5 is the relationship expected for a population of objects in a \u039bCDM concordance\ncosmology, with [Z/H] = 0.37 and [\u03b1/F e] = 0.27 and a formation age of 4.5 Gyr. To reproduce the H\u03b2 line-strengths, a\npopulation with the same chemical composition would need\na formation age of approximately 2.5 Gyr and hence yield\ninconsistent line-strengths for H\u03b3.\nIn Figure 7 we show the correlations between the parameter estimates of Figure 6 and in Table 2 we show the\nSpearman rank correlation coefficient (\u22121 6 \u03c1 6 +1) and\nin brackets the significance of the correlation from zero\n(0 6 s\u03c1 6 1; with low values having greater significance).\nFrom this we can see that, except for the lowest mass sample, correlations between the parameters have little statistical significance, i.e. values for s\u03c1 > 0.1. While interpretation\nof the lowest mass sample is difficult because of the gradients\nin [Z/H] and [\u03b1/Fe] with redshift, possibly due to including\na population of young objects at low redshift (c.f. the H\u03b2\nredshift relationship in Figure 5), there does appear to be a\nsignificant correlation between the chemical composition of\n\n\f8\n\nDan P.

Segregation of the line-strengths for the different samples is obvious except in the case of H\u03b2.\nThe more massive the sample (i.e. the higher velocity dispersion), the stronger the Mg b and hFei line-strengths and the weaker the H\u03b3F\nline-strength at a given redshift. Errors are only provided on the the 260 < \u03c3v 6 290 km s\u22121 sample (green circles) to avoid overcrowding\non the plot.

Reconstruction the evolution of the mean luminosity-weighted age using H\u03b2, Mg b , Fe5270 and Fe5335. The only difference\nbetween this figure and Figure 6 is the choice of Balmer line used in the estimation of the SSP parameters. While the trend of the ageredshift relationship is the same as that derived using H\u03b3F , there is more variability in the age estimates resulting from the variability\nin H\u03b2 as seen in Figure 5. Also the ages derived using H\u03b2 are systematically older than those derived using H\u03b3F . Symbols and lines are\nthe same as in Figure 6 and we have excluded the [Z/H] and [\u03b1/Fe] traces here as they are similar to the corresponding traces in Figure 6.\n\nthe objects decreases with redshift, although the ages are\nolder by approximately 2.5 Gyr.\n4.3\n\nSSP Parameter Estimates - Gaussian Priors\n\nBy binning our samples into redshift intervals, we have obtained multiple independent estimates of the chemistry of\nour LRG population. For each mass sample we can use\nthese independent estimates of [Z/H] and [\u03b1/Fe] to produce\na prior probability distribution, which we can then employ\nto better constrain the age estimates when estimating the\nposterior probability using Equation 1. When determining\nthe priors on [Z/H] and [\u03b1/Fe] , we only use individual estimates that have been produced using line-strength data\nwith S/N> 100 \u00c5 \u22121 in H\u03b3F and we generate\u221aGaussian\npriors from the mean and standard error (rms/ n) of the\n[Z/H] and [\u03b1/Fe] distributions for a given mass sample. We\nuse importance sampling (Lewis & Bridle 2002) and the new\n\nGaussian priors to re-weight the original MCMC chain data\nobtained with uniform priors on the parameters. Although\n[\u03b1/Fe] does not correlate with age, [Z/H] does (see Figure 3\nof TMBO) and placing a prior constraint on [Z/H] results in\na tightening of the multivariate posterior distribution yielding a more localised marginalised distribution for the age of\nthe object.\nIn Figure 9 we show what effect the Gaussian priors\non [Z/H] and [\u03b1/Fe] have on the reconstruction of the ageredshift relationship for each mass sample. The impact of the\nprior on [\u03b1/Fe] is negligible, but the decrease in the errors on\nthe individual age estimates, and the reduction in the scatter\nfor a given mass sample resulting from the prior on [Z/H] ,\nand the age-metallicity degeneracy, is significant. Over the\nredshift range studied herein, we see a decrease in the age of\nLRGs of \u2243 5Gyrs, which is fully consistent with expectations\nfrom a \u039bCDM universe.\n\n\fThe age-redshift relationship for SDSS LRGs\n\n11\n\nFigure 9.

The size of the error bars on the 260 < \u03c3v 6 290 km s\u22121 (circles/green) sample are about the same\nsize as the data points.\n\n5\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe present in Figures 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9, the results of our\nanalysis of LRG ages, metallicities and \u03b1-enhancements as\na function of redshift. We also provide in Appendices C and\nD the data presented in these figures. Overall, these trends\nare consistent with expectations and can provide important\nconstraints on cosmology (via the age-redshift relation) and\ngalaxy evolution studies. However, we raise here a number\nof important caveats that should be considered when using\nthese data.\nFirst, we have tried to select a consistent population\nof quiescent galaxies with redshift using the SDSS Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) selection, which is designed to select \"red and dead\" massive galaxies out to z \u223c 0.4 (with\na constant number density). The size of this LRG sample\nalso allows us to preferentially select quiescent galaxies with\nno obvious emission lines, as well as define four subsamples\nwith the same range of velocity dispersions and luminosities.\nHowever, we have employed a simple evolutionary correction\nthat maybe too naive at higher redshift and also performed\naperture corrections to velocity dispersion measurements for\nwhich it has been necessary to assume that corrections derived at low redshift objects can be applied to higher redshift\nobjects. This assumes no evolution in velocity dispersion, or\nstellar population distributions, and hence no evolution in\nthe mass distribution, over the range 0.0 < z < 0.4. Both\nof these assumptions may impact on the samples used in\ngenerating the stacked spectrum and could potentially result in different populations at high and low redshift being\nprobed. This could explain the gradients in the [Z/H] and\n[\u03b1/Fe] -redshift relationships even if each population probed\nis passively evolving.\nWhile some studies into the luminosity function for\nthe red sequence have shown that the most massive systems show little or no evolution over the redshift range\nprobed in this work, (See Bell et al. 2004; Faber et al. 2007),\nthis may not be true for lower mass systems in our sam-\n\nple. The anticorrelation between [Z/H] and [\u03b1/Fe] for the\n230 < \u03c3v 6 260 sample suggests that the low mass systems become less alpha-enhanced and more metal-enriched\nat late times. This could arise if our galaxy sample includes\na fraction of \"blue cloud\" galaxies whose star formation is\nswitching off and hence moving onto the red sequence since\nz=0.4. These low mass systems have been forming stars over\nlonger periods of time and have experienced more chemical\nenrichment than galaxies with similar velocity dispersions\nwhose star formation switched off at earlier times, giving\nthem lower [\u03b1/Fe] and higher [Z/H] at low redshift. This low\nmass sample, while possibly offering insights into the mechanisms behind galaxy evolution, is less useful in its intended\nrole as a cosmological probe due to the possibility of not\naccurately tracing a passively evolving sample of galaxies.\nThere are further complications from adopting the\nLick/IDS system when estimating the SSP parameters, even\nthough this is a popular and well-known method. For example, matching the SDSS instrumental resolution to that of\nthe IDS instrument, as well as performing each of the aperture, velocity dispersion and zero-point corrections, potentially introduces a source of error into our line-strengths and\nthus SSP parameter estimations. Also, the KMT05 models\nare not perfectly matched to the Lick/IDS system and therefore, the accuracy of our SSP parameter estimates could depend on the difference between the calibration of the data to\nthe models. This difference varies for each of the Lick indices,\nresulting in the absolute value of any SSP parameter being\ndependent on the particular set of Lick indices chosen. This\nis illustrated in Figures 6 & 8 by the discrepancy between\nthe absolute ages for our quiescent LRGs when derived using H\u03b3 or H\u03b2 . Therefore, we would caution the reader from\nusing our absolute ages in this paper, but recommend they\nfocus on the relative ages with redshift.\nWe also note that our observed line-strengths are\nstrongly dependent on the accuracy of the velocity dispersion correction (see Appendix A). Since the velocity dispersion correction depends on the stellar sample used to gener-\n\n\f12\n\nDan P. Carson and Robert C. Nichol\n\nate the correction factors, matching the stellar sample to the\ndominant stellar population of the LRG may become important in the future. Also, at higher redshift, the contribution\nof younger stellar populations to the galaxy spectrum may\nrequire a different stellar sample to be used in making the\nvelocity dispersion correction. Therefore, questions remain\nover the appropriateness of employing a single stellar sample\nof KIII stars to determine the velocity dispersion correction\nover the redshift range used in this work.\nHowever, we finish by stressing that for our samples\nwe see little evolution in the shape of [Z/H] and [\u03b1/Fe] with\nredshift, especially for the intermediate mass (velocity dispersion) samples which are consistent with a constant over\nthe redshifts probed. This is re-assuring as it does indicate\nthat our attempts to select a passively evolved, quiescent\nsubsample of galaxies that could be used to probe the age\u2013\nredshift relation can be found and the errors well-controlled.\nWe provide these relationships here for others to use in their\nanalyses, and plan to explore the cosmological constraints of\nour age-redshift relationships in a subsequent paper.\n\n6\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe present here a detailed analysis of a sample of passive\nSDSS LRGs which are selected to be the same population\nof galaxies over the redshift range 0.0 < z < 0.4. A total\nof 17,853 LRGs are co-added in four bins of velocity dispersion and luminosity to provide high signal\u2013to-noise spectra for detailed spectra absorption line measurements. In\nSection 3 and Appendix A, we outline the careful calibration of these absorption line measurements onto the well\u2013\nestablished Lick/IDS system which has been extensively\nused in the literature to constrain Simple Stellar Population\n(SSP) models and thus derive galaxy parameters like age,\nmetallicity and \u03b1\u2013enhancements. In Figures 4, 5, 7 and 8,\nwe present our results which show clear trends for these parameters with redshift (we also provide the data from these\nfigures in Appendices C & D). In particular, for our two\nintermediate mass (velocity dispersion) samples, we see a\nconstant [Z/H] and [\u03b1/Fe] with redshift which confirms our\nassumptions that these LRGs are a passively evolving subsample of galaxies (i.e., they are chemically unevolved over\nthis redshift range) providing confidence on our age determinations for these galaxies. We see a clear trend of decreasing\nage of our LRGs as a function of redshift (\u2243 5Gyrs over the\nredshift range probed here), which is fully consistent with\nexpectations from a \u039bCDM universe. It also appears that the\nmost massive sample of LRGs is also the youngest (Figures\n5 and 8). We provide these relationships now to help others\nstudying cosmology and galaxy evolution, as well as provide\nin our appendices, the methodology required for others to\ncalibrate SDSS spectra onto the Lick/IDS system.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Nichol\u00e1s Cardiel for supplying a version of INDEXF compatible with SDSS FITS files and Daniel Thomas\nfor supplying higher resolution SSP models than those available publicly.

We use the most recent definitions of the Lick indices from Trager et al.

Also, in Equations A1 and A2, \u03bbc1 and \u03bbc2 are the\nwavelength definitions of the feature bandpass and F(\u03bb) and\nC(\u03bb) are the flux in the index bandpass and pseudocontinuum respectively. When measuring the line-strengths of\nabsorption features we use the software package INDEXF\n(Cardiel 2007).\nThe flux in the local pseudocontinuum, C(\u03bb), is determined using\n\u03bb \u2212 \u03bbb\n\u03bbr \u2212 \u03bb\nC(\u03bb) \u2261 Fb\n+ Fr\n,\n\u03bbr \u2212 \u03bbb\n\u03bbr \u2212 \u03bbb\nwhere\nFb \u2261\nand\nFr \u2261\n\nZ\n\n\u03bb\n\n\u03bb\n\nb2\n\nb1\n\nZ \u03bbr\n2\n\u03bbr\n\n1\n\nF (\u03bb)\nd\u03bb ,\n\u03bbb 2 \u2212 \u03bbb 1\nF (\u03bb)\nd\u03bb ,\n\u03bbr2 \u2212 \u03bbr1\n\n(A3)\n\n(A4)\n\n(A5)\n\nand\n(A6)\n\u03bbb \u2261 (\u03bbb2 + \u03bbb1 )/2 , \u03bbr \u2261 (\u03bbr2 + \u03bbr1 )/2 .\n\u03bbb1 , \u03bbb2 , \u03bbr1 and \u03bbr2 are the wavelength definitions of the\nblue and red bandpasses. The resulting local pseudocontinuum, C(\u03bb), generated by this approach is a straight line\nthat connects the average flux, defined at the central wavelength, of the blue (Fb , \u03bbb ) and red (Fr , \u03bbr ) bandpasses of\nthe index.\n\n\f14\nA1\n\nDan P. Carson and Robert C. Nichol\nTransforming to Lick/IDS\n\nSince the Lick indices have been defined with spectra taken\non the IDS, the absorption index system developed by the\nLick group has the characteristics of the IDS instrument inherent to it. Also, the spectra obtained by the Lick group\nwere not flux calibrated and this results in the shape of\nthe continuum of a Lick/IDS spectra differing to the true\nshape. Line-strengths measured on spectra not observed\nwith the IDS instrument need to be transformed to the\nLick/IDS system such that they can be compared with\nLick/IDS calibrated SSP models. For galaxy spectra this requires that spectra are smoothed to the IDS resolution and\nline-strengths are corrected for aperture and velocity dispersion effects and zero-point corrections applied. These steps\nare described in more detail in the following subsections.\nA2\n\nMatching Instrumental Resolutions\n\nThe measured line-strength of a given Lick Index depends\non, amongst other things, the instrumental resolution. As a\nresult of the fixed wavelength definitions of the index bandpasses and pseudocontinua, the line-strength generally decreases as the instrumental resolution is degraded. This instrumental broadening causes the wings of the spectral feature to extend outside their bandpass window reducing the\nstrength of the absorption feature within the window. In\naddition to this, adjacent spectral features may depress the\nflux in the continuum by being broadened into the continuum windows reducing the line-strength further.\nIn order to transform SDSS spectra to the Lick/IDS\nsystem, it is necessary to degrade the higher resolution SDSS\nspectra to match the lower resolution of the IDS instrument.\nBut, because the Lick/IDS calibrated SSP models produce\nindex strengths for a stellar population in the rest frame\nat the resolution of the Lick/IDS system, it is necessary to\nensure that the absorption feature in the observed spectrum\nhas the same instrumental resolution as it would have at\nrest in the Lick/IDS system.\nThe SDSS spectrographs have 640 fibers with the spectral resolution of each fiber having a slightly different dependence with wavelength. The response of the IDS instrument\ncan be treated as a Gaussian of wavelength dependent width\n(Worthey & Ottaviani 1997) and to match instrumental resolutions, the SDSS spectra were convolved with a Gaussian\nwhose wavelength dependent width was found using\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c3Lick\n((1 + z) \u03bbLick ) = \u03c3SDSS\n(\u03bbobs ) + \u03c3match\n(\u03bbobs ) ,\n\n(A7)\n\nwhere \u03c3match (\u03bbobs ) is the width of the Gaussian required\nto match the Lick/IDS and SDSS spectral resolutions,\n\u03c3Lick ((1+z) \u03bbLick ) is the wavelength dependent spectral resolution of the Lick/IDS instrument shifted to the observed\nframe and \u03c3SDSS (\u03bbobserved ) is the SDSS resolution for a particular fiber.\nThe SDSS spectral resolution is determined for each\nobject separately using information in the header (HDU #6)\nof the FITS file for a given object. This header contains the\nRMS resolution (in pixels) as a function of pixel number\nand to convert from RMS resolution in pixel units to RMS\nresolution in wavelength units, the RMS resolution in pixels\nis multiplied by the local pixel size in wavelength units\n\u03c3\u03bb = \u03c3pix \u00d7 ln(10) \u00d7 \u03bbpix \u00d7 10\u22124 ,\n\n(A8)\n\nwhere \u03bbpix is the wavelength at a given pixel and the factor 10\u22124 is a result of the SDSS spectra being binned with\nconstant logarithmic dispersion of this size.\nThe convolution of the SDSS spectra with a Gaussian\nwas performed in pixel space and is given by\nm\u22121\n\n(S \u2297 G(j))j =\n\nX\n\nSj+i\u2212m/2 Gi (j) ,\n\n(A9)\n\ni=0\n\nwhere S is the science spectrum, G(j) is the variable width\nGaussian and m is the width of the Gaussian window function and is set at 4.5 times the FWHM of the Gaussian.\nThe width of the Gaussian is wavelength dependent, which\nin pixel space means that the width is a function of pixel\nlocation j. At each pixel j, a normalized Gaussian is generated whose width in pixels is determined from Equations A7\nand A8, where \u03c3Lick (\u03bb) is inferred from linear interpolation\nof the data in Table 8 of Worthey & Ottaviani (1997), after converting the air wavelengths in the table to vacuum\nwavelengths and redshifting to the frame of the observed\nspectrum, \u03bbobs = (1 + z) \u03bbLick .\nAs a result of this convolution procedure, the resolution\nof the SDSS spectra at the observed wavelength is matched\nto the resolution at the corresponding rest-frame wavelength\non the Lick/IDS system, and consequently absorption features measured in the target spectrum match the resolution\nof the same feature on the Lick/IDS system.\nA3\n\nVelocity Dispersion Corrections\n\nThe observed spectrum of a galaxy is equivalent to the convolution of the instrumental response function, the distribution of the line-of-sight velocities of its stars and their\nintegrated spectrum. The velocity dispersion of the galaxy\nand the instrumental response both broaden spectral features, thereby depressing the measured line-strengths from\ntheir intrinsic value.\nThe Lick/IDS system is based upon an empirical stellar library and is therefore defined at zero intrinsic velocity\ndispersion. In order to compare galaxy index measurements\nto their SSP model predictions, the raw measurements need\nto be corrected to zero velocity dispersion.\nTo generate the correction factors, we adopted the approach of Poggianti et al. (2001), which involves matching\nthe resolution of a sample of SDSS stellar spectra to the\nLick/IDS resolution. Then, each stellar spectrum was further convolved with a Gaussian, in logarithmic wavelength\nspace, to mimic the velocity dispersion of a galaxy and\nwas repeated for velocity dispersions in the range \u03c3 =\n0 \u2212 420 km s\u22121 in steps of 20 km s\u22121 .\nWhen estimating velocity dispersions, the SDSS\npipeline uses template spectra which are convolved to a maximum velocity dispersion of 420kms\u22121 , which we then adopt\nas the maximum velocity dispersion to broaden our stellar\nspectra by. Incidentally, the template spectra used by the\nSDSS pipeline are stellar spectra taken from plate 321, the\nsame plate used in this work to calibrate the systematic offsets and place the SDSS on the Lick/IDS system.\nThe selection of the stellar spectra used to generate\nthe correction factors utilises the SEGUE Stellar Parameter Pipeline (SSPP; Lee et al. 2007) database via the CAS.\nAs part of the SSPP, the stellar spectra are cross-correlated\n\n\fThe age-redshift relationship for SDSS LRGs\nTable A1.

In Figure A2 we show the comparison between our measurements and those of Worthey et al. (1994)\nfor the 13 Lick stars observed by SDSS. In Table A2 the\nstatistical significance of the mean offset (|offset|/\u03c3) for the\nmajority of\n\u221a indices can be seen to be less than 2\u03c3, where\n\u03c3 = rms/ N. Consequently, we choose only to apply zeropoint offsets to those indices with offsets that have > 2\u03c3\nsignificance and these are shown in Figure A2 as panels with\nbold borders.\n\n(A10)\n\n06i63\n\nto the correction factor data for each index where \u03c3 represents the velocity dispersion. This polynomial fit is employed\nwhen making velocity dispersion corrections to a given linestrength. In Figure A1 we show the correction factors and\nthe best fitting polynomial for each index. In Table A1 we\npresent the coefficients of the best fitting polynomial to CI\nfor each Lick index.\nA4\n\nZero-Point Corrections\n\nThe Lick/IDS spectra were not flux calibrated but instead normalized to a calibration lamp. Differences between\nthe continuum of the fluxed SDSS spectra and normalized\nLick/IDS spectra will manifest themselves as systematic offsets between our measured line strengths and those of common objects already on the Lick/IDS system. To determine\n\nA5\n\nAperture Corrections\n\nThe measured velocity dispersion and the line-strengths of\nabsorption features for a galaxy is affected by a number\nof factors which include the size and shape of the spectrograph aperture used to sample the light from the galaxy, the\ndistance to the galaxy, the luminosity distribution and the\ndistribution of stellar velocities.\nElliptical galaxies exhibit radial gradients in their velocity dispersions as well as in their absorption-line indices\n(Mehlert et al. 2000), and it is necessary to correct for these\ngradients when comparing our results to other results in the\nliterature. Corrections are also necessary when comparing\ndata over a large range in redshift as the fixed spectrograph\naperture will sample different physical scales depending on\nthe distance to the galaxy.\nA further complication when comparing results to those\n\n\f16\n\nDan P. Carson and Robert C. Nichol\n\nFigure A1. Velocity dispersion correction curves for each Lick index, determined from a sample of 31 K III stars. The size of the symbol\nat a given \u03c3 indicates the magnitude of the standard deviation in correction factors for the stellar sample used.\n\nin the literature is the size and shape of the spectrograph\naperture used. We use the method of J\u00f8rgensen et al. (1995)\nto convert rectangular apertures to an equivalent circular\naperture of radius rap . They show that a velocity dispersion\nestimated with a circular aperture would yield the same\nmean value, to within 4%, as that through a rectangular\naperture if 2rap = 1.025 \u00d7 2(xy/\u03c0)1/2 , where x and y are the\ndimensions of the rectangular aperture.\nJ\u00f8rgensen et al. also show how the velocity dispersion,\nmeasured with a circular aperture, varies with aperture radius and they have determined that within an effective radius, the velocity dispersion profile normalised to \u03c3e8 , can\nbe approximated by a power law of the form\n\u03c3ap\n=\n\u03c3e8\n\nrap\nre /8\n\n!\u03b1\n\n,\n\n(A11)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the gradient in the velocity dispersion, re is the\neffective radius of the galaxy and \u03c3e8 is the velocity dispersion measured through an aperture of re /8.\nUsing Equation A11, and following the approach of\nBernardi et al. (2003a), we correct the measured velocity\ndispersion, \u03c3ap , returned by the SDSS pipeline to a veloc-\n\nity dispersion, \u03c3corr \u2261 \u03c3e8 , that would be measured through\nre /8. From re \u2261 (b/a)1/2 rdeV , we determined re , where rdeV\nis the de Vaucouleurs radius, b is the semi-minor axis and a\nis the semi-major axis of the galaxy, i.e. re is the effective circular radius. We use the values of rdeV , a and b determined\nfrom the SDSS r-band photometry and obtained using the\nparameters deVrad r and deVAB r from the CAS.\nSimilar expressions to Equation A11 are used to correct\nthe measured line-strengths to the standard-size aperture\nrap\nlog Icorr = log Irap \u2212 \u03b1I log\n,\n(A12)\nre /8\nfor atomic indices and\nrap\nIcorr = Irap \u2212 \u03b1I log\n,\nre /8\n\n(A13)\n\nfor molecular indices, where \u03b1I is the radial gradient\n(\u2206 log I/\u2206 log r) for the index and Irap is the line-strength\nmeasured from the SDSS spectra.\nIn order to correct the velocity dispersions and index\nmeasurements for aperture effects we adopt the index gradients of Mehlert et al. (2003), in which they have determined\ngradients for H\u03b2 , Mg b, Fe5270, Fe5335 and the velocity dispersion, \u03c3, for a sample of 35 early-type galaxies.\n\n\fThe age-redshift relationship for SDSS LRGs\n\n17\n\nFigure A2.

The mean\noffset for each index is indicated by the solid line. Some panels have less that 13 data points because of missing data from either the\nWorthey et al. dataset or our own.

The median error bar is indicated for each index and \u2206 Index is in the sense SDSS - Worthey.\n\nA6\n\nComparison with Previous Data\n\nIn order to test our transformation/calibration to the\nLick/IDS system it is necessary to perform similar comparisons to that already used in determining the zero-point offsets. There exists extensive work in the literature where authors have obtained line-strengths determined from galaxy\nspectra and have also calibrated their line-strengths to the\nLick/IDS system. Not every source in the literature explores\nthe full set of Lick indices so we restrict our comparison to\nH\u03b2 , Mg b , Fe5270 and Fe5335. All objects that have been\nselected for study in this comparison have been matched to\nwithin 5\" of an SDSS object and have a velocity dispersion\navailable from the SDSS pipeline.\nMoore et al. (2002) have observed early-type galaxies in\nComa of which 49 have SDSS spectra. All data, both literature and SDSS, have been corrected to a standard circular\naperture of re /8, where re has been determined for each\nobject from their SDSS r-band photometric parameters and\nthe method outlined in Section A5.

We perform a similar test to TMBO, using a model object with\nan age of 10.7 Gyr, [Z/H] = 0.26 and [\u03b1/Fe] = 0.25, which\nyields line-strengths of H\u03b2 = 1.59 \u00c5, Mg b = 4.73 \u00c5 and\nhFei = 2.84 \u00c5. Adopting these line-strengths and the associated errors of d H\u03b2 = 0.06 \u00c5, d Mg b = 0.06 \u00c5 and\nd hFei = 0.05 \u00c5 we then employ our MCMC approach to recover the original model object SSP parameters and also\nobtain the errors on the parameters associated with the\nadopted errors on the line-strengths. When evaluating Equation 1 we employ uniform base priors which cover the full\nsupport of each of the SSP parameters and we recover the\nsame bivariate parameter distributions as those shown in\nFigure 3 of TMBO.\nWe have also estimated the SSP parameters for 123\nearly-type galaxies from Table 2 of TMBO and use their\nline-strength data and our MCMC implementation, where\nthe MCMC simulation for each object consists of 3 parallel\nchains each of which is 10,000 iterations in size. We use the\nb\nGelman-Rubin R-statistic\nto determine when convergence\nto the stationary distribution has occurred and exclude the\nburn-in phase of each chain before pooling the data for the\nthree chains and estimating one-dimensional marginalised\nposterior parameters. We show the results of this comparison in Figure B1.\nThe results of this comparison indicates that our\nMCMC approach is able to produce reliable parameter estimates and errors. In Table B1 our errors are slightly larger\nthan those of TMBO but a similar comparison for the data\nin Figure B1 would suggest that our errors are generally in\ngood agreement. A more detailed error analysis is prohibited by the fact that we report errors based on the 15.9 and\n84.2 percentiles of the marginalised posterior distribution,\n\nTable B1.

Line\nstrengths were measured on coadded spectra calibrated to\nthe Lick/IDS system, described in Appendix A, after selecting individual objects using the strategy described in Section 2.

Here we show the residual differences between the MCMC approach of this work and the MC approach of TMBO for 123\nearly-type galaxies. For a small number of objects our approach yields slightly older ages than TMBO and consequently lower metallicities\nas a result of the age-metallicity degeneracy, hence the tail of the distributions to older ages and lower metallicities.

Carson and Robert C. Nichol\n\nAPPENDIX D: DERIVED SSP PARAMETER\nDATA\nWe provide here the SSP parameters determined for each of\nthe mass samples shown in Figure 6. Parameter estimates\nare determined from the posterior probability distribution\ndescribed in Section 3 and Section 4. Briefly, each SSP\nparameter is estimated by determining the 16, 50 and 84\npercentiles of posterior distribution after marginalising over\nthe remaining two parameters. For Tables D1-D4 the posterior distribution has been obtained using uniform priors\nthat span the full support of each of the KMT05 parameters, i.e. age (Gyr) \u223c U(0.31, 18.2), [Z/H] \u223c U(\u22121.0, 0.97),\n[\u03b1/Fe] \u223c U(\u22120.25, 0.73). For Table D5 the posterior distribution has been re-weighted, as described in Section 4, to\naccount for Gaussian priors placed on [Z/H] and [\u03b1/Fe] , in\norder to better constrain the age\u2013redshift relationship.\n\n\fThe age-redshift relationship for SDSS LRGs\nTable D1.
