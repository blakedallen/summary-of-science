Then the integral\n|fC |2s \u03c9 is extended to a meromorphic function in s on the entire complex\nXC\nplane (using a resolution of singularities\nR [5] together with a partition of unity, see\n[1], [2].) Moreover, the largest pole of XC |fC |2s \u03c9 coincides up to a sign with the\nlog canonical threshold of fC if \u03c9 is nonnegative and does not vanish on a point x\nof DC := fC\u22121 (0) where the log canonical threshold of (fC , x) attains the minimal.\n(This follows from the definition by using a resolution of singularities, see [7].)\nLet f be a nonconstant real algebraic function on a real algebraic manifold XR ,\nand \u03c9 be a C \u221e form of the highest degree with compact support on XR such that\nthe open\n{x \u2208 XR | \u03c9(x) 6= 0} is oriented and \u03c9(x) is positive on this subset.\nR subset\ns\nThen XR |f | \u03c9 is similarly extended to a meromorphic function in s on the entire\nR\ncomplex plane. But the largest pole of XR |f |s\u03c9 does not necessarily coincide up\nto a sign with the log canonical threshold of the complexification fC : XC \u2192 C of\nf : XR \u2192 R, see Corollary 2 and Theorem 1 below.\nLet OXR denote the sheaf of real analytic functions on XR . We define the\nreal multiplier ideals J (XR , f \u03b1 ) \u2282 OXR for \u03b1 \u2208 Q>0 by the local integrability\nof |g|/|f |\u03b1 for g \u2208 OXR . (Here coherence of J (XR , f \u03b1 ) is unclear.) We have\nJ (XR , f \u03b1 ) = OXR for 0 < \u03b1 \u226a 1, but not necessarily\nf J (XR , f \u03b1 ) = J (XR , f \u03b1+1 ) for \u03b1 > 0,\nunless f is of ordinary type. Here we say that f is of ordinary type if codim DR = 1\nwhere DR = f \u22121 (0) \u2282 XR , and of exceptional type otherwise. Note that the above\nequality always holds in the complex case.\nDate: July 25, 2007, v.3.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nMORIHIKO SAITO\n\nBy Hironaka [5], there is a resolution of singularities as real algebraic manifolds\n\u2032\n\u03c0R : XR\n\u2192 XR which is a composition of blowing-ups along smooth\nover\nQrcenters\n\u2032 mi\n\u2217\n\u2217\nRQ\nand such that \u03c0 f and \u03c0 dx1 * * * dxn are locally of the form u i=1 xi and\nu\u2032 ri=1 x\u2032i ai dx\u20321 * * * dx\u2032n respectively, where mi \u2265 1 for i \u2208 [1, r]. Here x1 , . . . , xn and\n\u2032\nx\u20321 , . . . , x\u2032n are local coordinates of XR and XR\nrespectively, and u,P\nu\u2032 are nowhere\n\u2217\n\u2032\n\u2032\nvanishing. So \u03c0 f defines a divisor with normal crossings DR = j\u2208JR mj Dj,R\n,\n\u2032\nand we may assume that each Dj,R is smooth by loc. cit. Let aj be the multiplicity\n\u2032\nof the Jacobian of \u03c0R along Dj,R\n. Note that mj and aj are given by the above mi\n\u2032\nand ai respectively if Dj,R is locally defined by yi\u2032 = 0.\nProposition 1. For g \u2208 OXR ,x we have\ng \u2208 J (XR , f \u03b1 )x \u21d0\u21d2 \u03c0 \u2217 gdx1 * * * dxn \u2208 \u03c0\u2217 \u03a9nX \u2032 (\u2212\nR\n\n\u0001\n\n\u2032\nj [\u03b1mj ]Dj,R ) x .\n\nP\n\n\u2032\nHowever, \u03c0\u2217 \u03a9nX \u2032 (\u2212 j [\u03b1mj ]Dj,R\n) may be larger than J (XR , f \u03b1)\u03a9nXR in general\nR\n(even for 0 < \u03b1 \u226a 1), and coherence of these sheaves are unclear. By Proposition 1\nthere are increasing rational numbers 0 < \u03b11 < \u03b12 < * * * such that\n\nP\n\nJ (XR , f \u03b1j ) = J (XR , f \u03b1 ) ) J (XR , f \u03b1j+1 ) if \u03b1j \u2264 \u03b1 < \u03b1j+1 (j \u2265 1),\nand OXR = J (XR , f \u03b1 ) ) J (XR , f \u03b11 ) if 0 < \u03b1 < \u03b11 . These numbers \u03b1j are called\nreal jumping numbers of f . (Here we add \"real\" since the complexification fC of\nf can be identified with f in case f \u2208 R[x] \u2282 C[x].) The minimal real jumping\nnumber \u03b11 is called the real log canonical threshold, and is denoted by rlct(f ). This\nis the smallest number such that |f |\u2212\u03b1 is not locally integrable on XR . It may be\nstrictly greater than 1 in case of exceptional type, see Theorem 1 below. We define\nthe graded pieces by\nG(XR , f \u03b1 ) = J (XR , f \u03b1\u2212\u03b5 )/J (XR , f \u03b1 ) for 0 < \u03b5 \u226a 1,\nso that \u03b1 is a real jumping number of f if and only if G(XR , f \u03b1 ) 6= 0. Proposition 1\nimplies\nCorollary 1. We have\nna + 1o\nj\n.\nj\u2208JR\nmj\n\nrlct(f ) = min\n\nA similar assertion holds for the log canonical threshold lct(fC ) by applying the\nsame argument to the resolution of singularities of the complexification fC , and\n\u2212lct(fC ) coincides\nR with the largest root of bfC (s), see [7]. Let \u2212p(f, \u03c9) denote the\nmaximal pole of XR |f |s \u03c9. Then\nCorollary 2. We have in general\n\np(f, \u03c9) \u2265 rlct(f ) \u2265 lct(fC ),\nand p(f, \u03c9) = rlct(f ) if \u03c9(x) 6= 0 for some x \u2208 XR such that G(XR , f \u03b1 )x 6= 0 with\n\u03b1 = rlct(f ).\nFor the corresponding assertion in the complex case, see [7]. The relation with\nthe complexification is quite complicated as is shown by the following.\n\n\fON REAL LOG CANONICAL THRESHOLDS\n\n3\n\nTheorem 1. There are cases where rlct(f ) > lct(fC ), and even rlct(f ) > 1 in case\nof exceptional type. Moreover the real jumping numbers of f can be disjoint from\nthe non-integral jumping numbers of fC even in the case fC has only an isolated\nsingularity at a real point x \u2208 XR \u2282 XC .\nThis kind of phenomena may happen in case f has an isolated zero of simple type,\nsee (3.3). Let bf (s) be the b-function of f which is by definition the least common\nmultiple of the local b-functions bf,x (s) for x \u2208 XR . Note that bf,x (s) coincides\nwith the local b-function bfC ,x (s) of fC , since bfC ,x (s) \u2208 Q[s] by Kashiwara [6]. So\nbf (s) = bfC (s) in case Sing f \u2282 XR .\nTheorem 2. Any real jumping number of f which is smaller than rlct(f ) + 1 is a\nroot of bf (\u2212s).\nFor the corresponding assertion in the complex case, see [4]. It seems that the\ncase P\nof an ideal generated by f1 , . . . , fr is reduced to the case r = 1 by considering\nf = ri=1 fi2 in the real case.\nThis note is written to answer questions of Professor S. Watanabe which are\nclosely related to problems in the theory of learning machines (see e.g. [10]). I\nwould like to thank him for interesting questions.\nIn Section 1 we recall some facts from the theory of resolutions of singularities\ndue to Hironaka [5]. In Section 2 we prove Proposition 1 and Theorem 2. In Section\n3 we prove Theorem 1 by constructing examples.\n1. Resolution of singularities\nIn this section we recall some facts from the theory of resolutions of singularities\ndue to Hironaka [5].\n1.1. Analytic spaces associated to R-schemes. Let X be a scheme of finite\ntype over R. We denote the associated real analytic space by XR . The underlying\ntopological space of XR is the set of R-valued points X(R) with the classical\ntopology. The sheaf of real analytic functions on XR is defined by taking local\nembeddings of X into affine spaces and dividing the sheaf of real analytic functions\non the affine spaces by the corresponding ideal.\nWe define XC similarly for a scheme X of finite type over C. In case X is a\nscheme of finite type over R, XC means the complex algebraic variety associated\nto the base change of X by R \u2192 C. So the underlying topological space of XC\ncoincides with X(C).\n1.2. Hironaka's resolution of singularities. Let X be a smooth scheme over\nR, and D an effective divisor on D. By Hironaka [5] we have a resolution of\nsingularities \u03c0 : (X \u2032 , D \u2032) \u2192 (X, D) which is a composition of blowing-ups along\nsmooth centers defined over R and such that D \u2032 is a divisor with normal crossings\nwhich is locally defined by algebraic local coordinates defined over R, see loc. cit.,\nCor. 3 in p. 146 and also Def. 2 in p. 141. (Note that the last condition implies\nthat the irreducible components Dj\u2032 of D \u2032 (j \u2208 J) are smooth over R by taking a\npoint of Sing Dj\u2032 ).\n\n\f4\n\nMORIHIKO SAITO\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\nThis induces a resolution of singularities \u03c0R : (XR\n, DR\n) \u2192 (XR , DR ) as in\nIntroduction, and\nJR = {j \u2208 J | Dj\u2032 (R) 6= \u2205}.\nNote that if a smooth center C of a blow-up has a real point x, then C is defined\nlocally by using local algebraic coordinates over R, and hence CR is a smooth\nsubvariety.\n\n2. Proofs of Proposition 1 and Theorem 2\nIn this section we prove Proposition 1 and Theorem 2.\n2.1. Proof of Proposition 1. With the notation of Introduction, we have locally\nQ\n\u03c0 \u2217 gf \u2212\u03b1dx1 * * * dxn = v ri=1 x\u2032i ai +bi \u2212\u03b1mi dx\u20321 * * * dx\u2032n ,\nQ\nif \u03c0 \u2217 g = u\u2032\u2032 i x\u2032i bi locally, where v, u\u2032\u2032 are nondivisible by x\u2032i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 r). For\n\u03b3, c > 0, we have\nZ c\nc\u03b3\n\u03b3\u22121\nx dx = ,\n\u03b3\n0\nwhere x means x\u2032i . Moreover, we have for \u03b2 = \u03b1mi and p = ai + bi\np \u2265 [\u03b2] \u21d0\u21d2 p > \u03b2 \u2212 1.\n\n(2.1.1)\n\nSo the implication \u21d0 in Proposition 1 follows. For the converse, assume the righthand side does not hold. Then the left-hand side does not hold by restricting to\n\u2032\na neighborhood of a sufficiently general point of Dj,R\nwhich is defined locally by\n\u2032\nxi = 0 and such that ai +bi \u2212\u03b1mi \u2264 \u22121 (using positivity). So the assertion follows.\n2.2. Proof of Corollary 1. By definition the minimal real jumping number is\nthe smallest number \u03b1 such that 1 \u2208\n/ J (XR , f \u03b1 ), i.e. |f |\u2212\u03b1 is not locally integrable\non XR . By Proposition 1, this condition is equivalent to that aj < [\u03b1mj ] (i.e.\naj \u2264 \u03b1mj \u2212 1, see (2.1.1)) for some j \u2208 JR . So the assertion follows.\n2.3. Proof of Corollary 2. We take a resolution of singularities as in (1.2). This\ngives a resolution of singularities of the complexification. We define similarly aj , mj\nfor any irreducible components Dj\u2032 of D \u2032 (j \u2208 J), and we have as in [7]\nna + 1o\nj\nlct(fC ) = min\n.\ni\u2208J\nmj\nSo the last inequality follows. Since rlct(f ) is the smallest number \u03b1 such that\n|f |\u2212\u03b1 is not locally integrable on XR , the first inequality and the last assertion\nfollow.\n2.4. Proof of Theorem 2. Let f+ (x) = f (x) if f (x) > 0 and f+ (x) = 0 otherwise.\nSet f\u2212 = (\u2212f )+ . Since |f |s = (f+ )s + (f\u2212 )s , we consider\nZ\nI(\u03c9, s) =\n(f+ )s \u03c9,\nXR\n\n\u221e\n\nwhere \u03c9 is a C form of the highest degree whose support is compact and is\ncontained in a sufficiently small open subset UR of XR with local coordinates\n\n\fON REAL LOG CANONICAL THRESHOLDS\n\n5\n\nx1 , . . . , xn giving an orientation of UR . Then I(\u03c9, s) is a holomorphic function on\n{s \u2208 C | Re s > 0}, and it is extended to a meromorphic function on the entire\ncomplex plane using a resolution of singularities, see [1], [2].\nLet x be a point of DR := f \u22121 (0) \u2282 XR , and bf (s) be the b-function of f at x.\nWe assume that UR is a sufficiently small open neighborhood of x in XR so that\nwe have the relation\n(2.4.1)\n\nbf (s)f s = P f s+1 in (OUR [ f1 ])[s], where P \u2208 \u0393(UR , DUR [s]).\n\nHere P is replaced by \u2212P if f+ is replaced by f\u2212 (and f by \u2212f ). Note that (2.4.1)\nholds in OUR [ f1 ] when s is specialized to any complex number.\nLet \u2217 be the involution of DUR such that g \u2217 = g for g \u2208 OUR , (\u2202/\u2202xi )\u2217 = \u2212\u2202/\u2202xi ,\nand (Q1 Q2 )\u2217 = Q\u22172 Q\u22171 for Q1 , Q2 \u2208 DUR , fixing the local coordinates x1 , . . . , xn on\nUR . This gives a right DUR -module structure on \u03a9nUR using a basis dx1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 dxn .\nP\nP\nWrite P = j Pj sj with Pj \u2208 DR , and set P \u2217 = j Pj\u2217 sj . Let r = max{ord Pj }.\nThen, for any complex number s with Re s > r, we have by (2.4.1) together with\nintegration by parts\nZ\nZ\nX\ns\n(2.4.2) bf (s)I(\u03c9, s) =\nbf (s)(f+ ) \u03c9 =\n(f+ )s+1 (P \u2217 \u03c9) =\nI(Pj\u2217 \u03c9, s + 1)sj ,\nUR\n\nUR\n\nj\n\nP\nsince i (\u2202/\u2202xi )\u03bdi (f+ )s is a continuous function on UR if Re s > i \u03bdi . Here Pj\u2217 \u03c9 is\ndefined by trivializing \u03a9nUR by dx1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 dxn , and it may be written as \u03c9Pj using\nthe right D-module structure explained above. By analytic continuation, (2.4.2)\nholds as meromorphic functions in s on the entire complex plane.\nLet \u03b1 be a real jumping number of f which is smaller than rlct(f ) + 1. Assume\nthat the above x belongs to the support of G(XR , f \u03b1 ), and \u03c9(x) 6= 0. There\nis g \u2208 \u0393(UR , OUR ) such that g \u2208 J (UR , f \u03b1\u2212\u03b5 )x for \u03b5 > 0 and g \u2208\n/ J (UR , f \u03b1 )x\n(shrinking UR if necessary). Then I(g\u03c9, s) is a holomorphic function in s for\nRe s > \u2212\u03b1 using a resolution of singularities as in (2.1), and\nQ\n\nI(g\u03c9, s) \u2192 +\u221e as s \u2192 \u2212\u03b1,\n(replacing f+ with f\u2212 if necessary). On the other hand, the I(Pj\u2217(g\u03c9), s + 1) are\nholomorphic functions in s for Re s + 1 > \u2212rlct(f ). Thus, replacing \u03c9 with g\u03c9 in\n(2.4.2), we get bf (\u2212\u03b1) = 0 since \u2212\u03b1 + 1 > \u2212rlct(f ). So the assertion follows.\nRemark. This argument shows that the order of pole of I(\u03c9, s) at \u2212rlct(f ) is at\nmost the multiplicity of \u2212rlct(f ) as a root of bf (s).\n2.5. b-Function of the complexification. For f \u2208 R{{x}}, the b-function bf (s)\nof f coincides with the b-function bfC (s) of the complexification fC (which is identified with f by R{{x}} \u2282P\nC{{x}}), since bfC (s) \u2208 Q[s] by Kashiwara [6].\nIndeed, if there is P = \u03bd,\u03bc,k a\u03bd,\u03bc,k x\u03bd \u2202 \u03bc sk with a\u03bd,\u03bc,k \u2208 C and satisfying\nbfC (s)f s = P f s+1,\n\nthen the same equation holds with P replaced by\n\n\u03bd \u03bc k\n\u03bd,\u03bc,k (Re a\u03bd,\u03bc,k )x \u2202 s .\n\nP\n\n\f6\n\nMORIHIKO SAITO\n\n2.6. Case of ideals. For an ideal I generated by f1 , . . . , fr , we may define the\nmultiplier ideals J (XR , I \u03b1 ) by local integrability of\nP\n|g|/( i |fi |)\u03b1 .\nP\nHowever, this is calculated by J (XR , f \u03b1/2 ) with f = i fi2 , using\nP\nP\nP\n2\n2\n2\ni |fi | \u2264 (\ni |fi |) \u2264 r\ni |fi | .\n3. Proof of Theorem 1\nIn this section we prove Theorem 1 by constructing examples.\n3.1. Definition. We say that f is of ordinary type if codim DR = 1, and of\n\u22121\nexceptional type\nPotherwise. Here DR = f (0) \u2282 XR .\nWrite f =\nk\u2265d fk \u2208 R{{x1 . . . , xn }} with fk homogeneous of degree k and\nfd 6= 0. We say that f has an isolated zero\ntype if the equation fd = 0\nPn of simple\nn\nd\nhas no solution in R \\ {0} (e.g. if fd = i=1 xi with d even).\n\n3.2. Remarks. (i) The function f is of ordinary type if and only if the reduced\ncomplex zero locus (DC )red has a smooth real point. Note that\ndimR (DR \u2229 Sing (DC )red ) < n \u2212 1,\n\nsince Sing (DC )red is defined over R and has dimension < n \u2212 1 where n = dim XR .\n(ii) In the case of exceptional type, the Dj\u2032 for j \u2208 JR are all exceptional divisors.\n(iii) In the case of ordinary type, we have J (XR , f \u03b1) \u2282 f OXR for \u03b1 \u2265 1, and\nhence\n(3.2.1)\n\nf J (XR , f \u03b1 ) = J (XR , f \u03b1+1 ) for \u03b1 > 0,\n\nshrinking XR to an open neighborhood of the points where the dimension of DR\nis n \u2212 1.\n(iv) The above equality (3.2.1) always holds in the complex case, and\nJN(fC ) = (JN(fC ) \u222a (0, 1]) + N,\n\n(3.2.2)\n\nwhere JN(fC ) is the set of jumping numbers of fC .\nThe following Proposition implies the first and second assertions of Theorem 1\nin the case n > d, since we have always lct(fC ) \u2264 1.\n3.3. Proposition. If f has only an isolated zero of simple type (3.1), then\n[\u03b1d]\u2212n+1\n\nJ (XR , f \u03b1 )0 = m0\n\n,\n\nRJN(f ) = {k/d | k \u2265 n},\n\nrlct(f ) = n/d,\n\nwhere m0 be the maximal ideal of OXR ,0 and RJN(f ) denote the set of real jumping\nnumbers of f .\nProof. In this case, we get a real resolution of singularities by the blow-up along\nthe origin, and DR = {0} since the exceptional divisor is the total transform\nof DR . In particular, f is of exceptional type, see (3.1). Then JR = {1} and\n(m1 , a1 ) = (d, n \u2212 1). So the assertion follows from Proposition 1.\n\n\fON REAL LOG CANONICAL THRESHOLDS\n\n7\n\n3.4 Example. Assume we have an expansion\nP\nf = fd1 + k\u2265d2 fk \u2208 R{{x1 . . . , xn }},\n\nwith fk homogeneous of degree k, fd1 = g e with g irreducible, h := f \u2212 g e (=\nP\nn\u22121\nbe the projective\nk\u2265d2 fk ) is nondivisible by fd1 , and d1 < d2 . Let Y \u2282 P\nhypersurfaces defined by g. Assume\nc := d2 \u2212 d1 \u2265 e \u2265 2, n > d := d1 /e,\nand YR is empty in the notation of (1.1). Then f has an isolated zero of simple\ntype at the origin, and\nrlct(f ) > lct(fC ),\nrestricting f to a sufficiently small Zariski-open subset X of the affine space An\ncontaining the origin and such that it is the only singular point of f .\nIndeed, let \u03c0 : X \u2032 \u2192 X be a resolution of singularities as in (1.2). Here we\nmay blow-up along the origin first. Let D1\u2032 \u2282 X \u2032 denote the proper transform of\nthe exceptional divisor of this blow-up. The pull-back of f by the blow-up along\nthe origin is locally given by xd1 (y e + xc z), where the exceptional divisor is locally\ndefined by x = 0, and the proper transforms of g and h are locally given by y and z\nrespectively. So the intersection of the proper transform of D and the exceptional\ndivisor by the blow-up along the origin is identified with Y , and the total transform\nof D is not a divisor with normal crossings at the generic point of Y since c \u2265 e \u2265 2\nand h is nondivisible by fd1 . So we have to blow-up along the proper transform\nof Y (after making it smooth). Let D2\u2032 \u2282 X \u2032 denote the proper transform of the\nexceptional divisor of this blow-up. Then we have\na1 + 1\nn\na2 + 1\nn+1\n(3.4.1)\nrlct(f ) =\n=\n>\n=\n\u2265 lct(fC ).\nm1\nd1\nm2\nd1 + e\nThis also implies the first assertion of Theorem 1 with rlct(f ) < 1 if n < d1 .\n3.5 Example. With the above notation and assumptions, assume further\nh = fd2 , n = 3, c = d = e = 2,\nand YC is smooth and intersects ZC at smooth points of ZC , where Z is the\nhypersurface defined by h. Then the resolution \u03c0 : X \u2032 \u2192 X is obtained by the two\nblowing-ups in Example (3.4), and we have J = {1, 2}, JR = {1}, m1 = 4, m2 = 6.\nSo f has an isolated singularity at the origin, and the eigenvalues \u03bb of the Milnor\nmonodromy on H 2 (F0 , C) satisfy \u03bb4 = 1 or \u03bb6 = 1, where F0 denotes the Milnor\nfiber.\nFor \u03bb = i, the \u03bb-eigenspace of the Milnor cohomology H 2(F0 , C)\u03bb is calculated\nby the filtered de Rham complex of a filtered simple regular holonomic D-module\n(M, F ) on P2C whose restriction to the complement of YC is a complex variation\nof Hodge structure of type (0, 0) and rank 1, and whose local monodromy around\nYC is \u22121, see [9] (or [8], 3.3 and 3.5). Since F0 M is a line bundle such that\n\u22972 F0 M = OP2 (Y ), we have F0 M = OP2 (1). Since \u0393(P2 , \u03a92P2 (1)) = 0, this implies\nF 2 H 2 (F0 , C)\u03bb = 0.\n\n\f8\n\nMORIHIKO SAITO\n\nThus rlct(f ) (= 3/4) does not appear in the spectrum [9] of fC . Then 3/4 is not\na jumping number of fC by [3] in the isolated singularity case. Since the minimal\njumping number of fC is 2/3 by (3.4.1), we get by (3.2.2)\nnk\no\nJN(fC ) \u2282\n+ j k = 4, 5, 6; j \u2208 N ,\n6\n(In fact, we can show the equality.) On the other hand, we have by Proposition (3.3)\nnk\no\nRJN(f ) =\nk\u22653 .\n4\nThis implies the last assertion of Theorem 1.\nReferences\n[1] M.F.
