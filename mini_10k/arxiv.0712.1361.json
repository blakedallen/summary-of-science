In addition, we also propose an analogous crossing equation for the dressing factor\nwhere extra boundary degrees of freedom preserve a SU (2|2)2 residual symmetry.\n\n\fThe exciting discovery of integrable structures in the planar N = 4 super Yang-Mills [1, 2, 3]1 has\nallowed for the determination of the perturbative spectrum for single trace operators. Particularly,\nin the limit of infinitely long operators [5, 6, 7, 8], some exact all-loop results, which are also valid\nin the strong coupling limit, have been obtained. They allow precise comparisons with the energy\nspectrum of the non-interacting closed strings in AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 carrying an infinitely large angular\nmomentum, as prescribed by AdS/CFT correspondence [9]. In such infinite limit, physical content\nof the theory is the spectrum of asymptotic states and their scattering matrix, and as a hallmark\nof integrable system, it is highly constrained by the residual symmetry present. The relevant\nasymptotic Bethe equations then arise from imposing periodic boundary conditions. In fact, the\nresidual symmetry proved to be sufficient to determine the two-particle scattering matrix between\nthe elementary excitations up to an overall scalar factor [7]. Such overall scalar factor, known as\n\"dressing factor\" in the literature, plays an important role in interpolating the weak-strong coupling\nspectrum of the gauge/string correspondence [10, 11, 12]. Unconstrained by the residual symmetry,\nthe dressing factor however needs to obey an extra symmetry known as \"crossing\" imposed on the\naforementioned two-particle scattering matrix [11, 12, 13]. The crossing symmetry existing here\nalso ensures the bound state of an elementary excitation and its anti-particle2 scatters trivially [7].\nIt is also possible to consider certain operators in N = 4 super Yang-Mills for which boundaries\nare present in the corresponding spin chains. This class of operators typically arises when one\nintroduces extra D3-branes in the bulk where open strings can end on. As such open string\nbecomes infinitely extended, locally near its end points, the system can be regarded as a semiinfinite configuration and the reflection of bulk excitations on the boundary has to be considered.\nAnalogous to the bulk scattering matrix, the boundary reflection matrix can be determined up to\nan overall scalar factor by the residual symmetries preserving certain class of integrable boundaries\n[14]3 . Moreover the overall scalar, sometimes referred as \"boundary dressing factor\", can again be\nfurther restricted by analogous crossing symmetry conditions.\nThe main objective of this note is to study these crossing symmetry conditions in two different\ncases depending on the residual symmetries preserved. Here, like in the usual relativistic integrable\ntheories [16], the boundary crossing symmetry condition relates the bulk and the boundary scattering matrices [14]. By specifying the boundary crossing transformation in relation to the bulk one,\nwe shall point out a connection between bulk and boundary dressing factors and propose a simple\n1\n\nSee also [4] for more comprehensive reference list.\nSometimes referred as the \"singlet\" states with respect to the residual symmetry algebra [7].\n3\nSee [15] for an earlier discussion on integrable boundary conditions for open strings in AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 .\n\n2\n\n1\n\n\fsolution to the boundary crossing equation derived in [14] for one of the two boundary conditions.\nFurthermore, we shall also present the crossing equation constraining the boundary dressing factor\nfor the other boundary condition.\nIn general, the elementary excitation in the asymptotic spin-chain is known as \"magnon\", and it\ncan be specified by its definite momentum p, energy E and flavor. The magnons of different flavor\narise as they combine to form a short multiplet under the residual symmetry group the spin chain\nground state preserves. For the infinite spin chain, as considered in [7], this is given by a centrally\nextended supergroup P SU (2|2)2 \u22c9 R3 \u223c\n= SU (2|2)2 \u22c9 R2 which preserves the ground state consisting\nexclusively of the complex adjoint scalar Zs. The energy of magnon E is then identified with one of\nthe three central charges, and can be related to the magnon momentum by the dispersion relation:\nE 2 \u2212 16g2 sin2\n\np\n= 1.\n2\n\n(1)\n\nHere the coupling g is related to the 't Hooft coupling \u03bb as 16\u03c0 2 g2 = \u03bb.\nThe unusual relation (1) differs from the usual standard relativistic one or the one for lattice\nvibrations (e.g. phonons), but rather shares features of both. In fact, it describes a complex torus\nwith two non-trivial circles [11],[13]. The first or \"real\" circle is given by shifting the magnon\nmomentum p \u2192 p + 4\u03c0Z; whereas the second or \"imaginary\" circle arises when we regard 4g sin p2\ninstead of p as the relevant relativistic momentum. Then for purely imaginary 4g sin p2 , the equation\nE 2 + (i4g sin p2 )2 = 1 describes a unit circle. Therefore the magnon energy E and \"momentum\"\n4g sin p2 are in fact defined on a torus and can be uniformized and expressed in terms of Jacobi\nelliptic functions. We can also introduce an alternative set of complex variables known as the\n\"spectral parameters\" x\u00b1 , which are more convenient for our purposes and we shall mostly use\nsubsequently. They are related to the momentum p and the energy E through:\neip =\n\nx+\n,\nx\u2212\n\nE=\n\nig\n1\nig\n+ +\u2212 \u2212,\n2 x\nx\n\n(2)\n\nand they are subject to the constraint:\nx+ +\n\n1\n1\ni\n\u2212 x\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 = .\n+\nx\nx\ng\n\n(3)\n\nCombining (2) and (3) directly reproduces the dispersion relation (1). Again the x\u00b1 should be\nuniformized on the torus and we shall later give the explicit expressions in terms of Jacobi elliptic\nfunctions.\n\n2\n\n\fThe asymptotic spin chains with boundaries turn up when studying the N = 4 super Yang-Mills\noperators dual to D3-branes with open string excitations. In the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 background, such\nD3-branes [17] can be chosen to wrap a holomorphic surface within the S 5 4 . For instance, for\nholomorphic surfaces Y = 0 or Z = 0 the D3-branes are three-spheres of maximum size within S 5\nand are usually called \"maximal giant gravitons\". The perturbative computations in the dual field\ntheory at weak coupling and the classical sigma model at strong coupling, have both shown that\nmaximal giant gravitons provide integrable boundary conditions for the open string sigma model\n[18, 19, 15, 14]. Depending on the relative orientations of the angular momentum of the giant\ngraviton and the open string ground state, two different cases can be considered. In one case, we\ncan take the Y = 0 giant graviton and let the open string ground state carry angular momentum\nalong the Z direction. The operator corresponding to this configuration is [20]:\ni ,i ,...,i\n\n,i\n\nj\n\nN\nN\u22121\nY j1 Yij22 . . . YiN\u22121\nOY = \u01ebj11 ,j22 ,...,jN\u22121\n(ZZ . . . ZZ)jiNN ,\nN\u22121 ,jN i1\n\n(4)\n\nwhere in , jn , n = 1, 2 . . . , N are the SU (N ) color indices. Essentially, one replaces the last entry in\nthe operator det Y which is dual to the Y = 0 giant graviton by an infinite chain of Zs. As explained\nin details in [14], in order to preserve both Zs and Y s in the ground state (4), the residual symmetry\ngroup is reduced to SU (1|2)2 \u2282 P SU (2|2)2 \u22c9 R3 . The elementary magnon which transforms as\n(2B , 2F ) under each copy of P SU (2|2) \u22c9 R3\n\n5\n\ncan now be expressed as an irreducible multiplet\n\nunder each copy of SU (1|2).\nAlternatively, we can take a Z = 0 maximal giant graviton, with an open string ground state\ncarrying angular momentum along the Z direction [14]\ni ,i ,...,i\n\nj\n\n,i\n\nN\u22121\nN\n(\u03c7L ZZ . . . ZZ\u03c7R )jiNN .\nZij11 Zij22 . . . ZiN\u22121\nOZ (\u03c7L , \u03c7R ) = \u01ebj11 ,j22 ,...,jN\u22121\nN\u22121 ,jN\n\n(5)\n\nBoundary impurities are added to prevent the factorization into a determinant plus a single trace\n[21]. In this case, the full P SU (2|2)2 \u22c9 R3 residual symmetry group preserves the string of Zs and\nthe Zs in the determinant. The elementary magnons as well as the boundary degrees of freedom will\ntransform in the fundamental representation (but carry different central charges) of the extended\nSU (2|2)2 .\nLet us first recall the situation without boundary conditions. In such infinite asymptotic spin\nchain, the elementary magnons propagate freely apart from pairwise scattering, the physical content\nof the theory is therefore the two body scattering matrix S(x1 , x2 ). With the presence of an\n4\n5\n\nThe S 5 is then given in our conventions by the surface |Z|2 + |W |2 + |Y |2 = 1.\nThe three central charges are shared between both copies of P SU (2|2) \u22c9 R3 .\n\n3\n\n\fadditional boundary, one also needs to take into account the scattering between the magnon and\nthe boundary and encode such interaction in a \"reflection matrix R(x)\" 6 . It was shown in [7]\n\u00b1\nby demanding the invariance of the scattering matrix S(x1 , x2 ) \u2261 S(x\u00b1\n1 , x2 ) under the residual\n\nsymmetry algebra psu(2|2)2 \u22c9 R3 , that it can be constrained up to an overall scalar. This is a\nhallmark of an integrable system and S(x1 , x2 ) takes the following schematic form:\n\u0010\n\u0011\nSfull (x1 , x2 ) = S02 (x1 , x2 ) \u015csu(2|2) (x1 , x2 ) \u2297 \u015csu\u2032 (2|2) (x1 , x2 ) .\n\n(6)\n\nHere \u015csu(2|2) (x1 , x2 ) and \u015csu\u2032 (2|2) (x1 , x2 ) are flavor dependent parts and are uniquely fixed by each\ncopy of su(2|2)\u22c9 R2 respectively, and non-trivially satisfy the Yang-Baxter and unitarity equations.\nThis further confirms the integrable structure of the theory. Whereas the remaining overall scalar\nfactor S0 (x1 , x2 )2 is given by7\n2\n\nS0 (x1 , x2 ) =\n\n\u2212\n(x+\n1 \u2212 x2 )(1 \u2212\n+\n(x\u2212\n1 \u2212 x2 )(1 \u2212\n\n1\n+)\n1\nx\u2212\n1 x2\n1\n2\n\u2212 ) \u03c3 (x1 , x2 )\nx+\n1 x2\n\n,\n\n(7)\n\n\u00b1\nthe function \u03c3(x1 , x2 ) \u2261 \u03c3(x\u00b1\n1 , x2 ) is usually referred to in the literature as the \"dressing factor\"\n\n[6, 10, 11, 12]. To determine \u03c3(x1 , x2 ) additional dynamical constraints, such as crossing symmetry\nin a relativistic theory [22] which interchanges particle/anti-particle (and perhaps higher loop computations), are required. Despite the non-standard dispersion relation for the elementary magnon\n(1), it was demonstrated in [13] that crossing symmetry can also be implemented provided the\ndressing factor satisfies the crossing equations:\n\u03c3(x\u03041 , x2 )\u03c3(x1 , x2 ) =\n\nx\u2212\n2\nf (x1 , x2 ) ,\nx+\n2\n\n(8)\n\n\u03c3(x1 , x\u03042 )\u03c3(x1 , x2 ) =\n\nx+\n1\nf (x1 , x2 ) ,\nx\u2212\n1\n\n(9)\n\nwhere x\u03041,2 are the \"crossed\" spectral parameters which we shall explain momentarily, and the\nfunction f (x1 , x2 ) is given by\nf (x1 , x2 ) \u2261\n\n+\n\u2212 \u2212\n+\n+ +\n(x\u2212\n(x\u2212\n1 \u2212 x2 )(1 \u2212 1/x1 x2 )\n1 \u2212 x2 )(1 \u2212 1/x1 x2 )\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+ \u2212 =\n+\n+\n\u2212 .\n(x1 \u2212 x2 )(1 \u2212 1/x1 x2 )\n(x1 \u2212 x2 )(1 \u2212 1/x+\n1 x2 )\n\n(10)\n\nThese equations also need to be supplemented with the unitarity condition\n\u03c3(x1 , x2 )\u03c3(x2 , x1 ) = 1 .\n\n(11)\n\nLet us now explain how crossing symmetry can be implemented in the context of magnon scattering\nfollowing [11, 13]. As discussed earlier, the magnon energy and momentum or equivalently the\n6\n\nSometimes in the literature one refers S(x1 , x2 ) as the \"bulk\" scattering matrix to distinguish from the \"boundary\"\n\nscattering matrix R(x) [16].\n7\nHere we follow the conventions as in [11] and [14].\n\n4\n\n\fspectral parameters x\u00b1 are in fact defined on a torus. Therefore we can parametrize them, subject\nto the dispersion relation (1) or (3) in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions [11]:\np(z) = 2am(z, k) ,\n\nsin\n\np(z)\n= sn(z, k) , E(z) = dn(z, k) .\n2\n\n(12)\n\nHere the elliptic modulus k = 4ig can be taken fixed in a conformal field theory, so that p and E\ncan be regarded as functions of the complex parameter z called \"generalized rapidity\"8 . Simple\nmanipulation of elliptic functions identities shows that the spectral parameters are given by,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 cn(z, k)\n\u00b1\n\u00b1 i (1 + dn(z, k)) .\n(13)\nx (z) =\n4g sn(z, k)\nThe two circles of the complex torus can be quantified by the shifts z \u2192 z \u00b1 2\u03c91 and z \u2192 z \u00b1 2\u03c92\nwith\n\u03c91 = 2K(k2 ) ,\n\n\u03c92 = 2iK(1 \u2212 k2 ) \u2212 2K(k2 ) ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere K(k2 ) is the complete elliptic integral of first kind9 . For elliptic modulus k2 = \u221216g2 \u2208 R,\nIm(\u03c91 ) = Re(\u03c92 ) = 0 and \u03c91 and \u03c92 can be identified with the half-period of real and imaginary\ncircles respectively. The complex torus can then be defined on the generalized rapidity z-plane by\nthe domain {|Re(z)| \u2264 \u03c91 , |Im(z)| \u2264 \u03c92 }. However, one should stress that (E(z), p(z)) are not both\nreal in the entire domain and the function S(z1 , z2 ) should be regarded as an analytic continuation\nof the S-matrix with real E and p (real values of the generalized rapidity) [23, 24].\nNow let us consider how x\u00b1 (z) transform under the translations on the z-plane. One can first\nverify that, along the real axis, the shift z \u00b1\u03c91 leaves x\u00b1 (z) invariant. However along the imaginary\naxis the shift z \u00b1 \u03c92 transforms x\u00b1 (z) as\nCrossing : x\u00b1 (z) \u2192 x\u00b1 (z \u00b1 \u03c92 ) = x\u0304\u00b1 (z) =\n\n1\nx\u00b1 (z)\n\n.\n\n(15)\n\nSuch transformation (15) is the \"crossing transformation\" defined in terms of the spectral parameters given in [13]. Here the notation x\u0304\u00b1 (z) \u2261 x\u0304\u00b1 are the crossed spectral parameters introduced\nearlier in (8) and (9). In terms of the magnon energy E(z) and momentum p(z), (15) corresponds to\nthe transformation (E(z), p(z)) \u2192 (\u2212E(z), \u2212p(z)) which is precisely how crossing transformation\nacts in relativistic theory, hence the terminology. One should note that in terms of the spectral\nparameters x\u00b1 , the \"double crossing\", i.e. applying (15) twice, appears to be a trivial map. However, on z-plane this is a non-trivial translation z \u2192 z + 2\u03c92 going round the imaginary circle\n8\n\nThe terminology here is drawn from the relativistic case, where the parametrization \u01eb = m cosh \u03b8 , p =\n\nm sinh \u03b8 , \u03b8 \u2208 R satisfies the dispersion relation \u01eb2 \u2212 p2 = m2 .\nR \u03c0/2\n9\n\u221a d\u03c6\nOur convention is K(k2 ) = 0\n.\n2\n2\n1\u2212k sin \u03c6\n\n5\n\n\fof the complex torus once. A non-trivial monodromy can be seen from the fact that the ratio\n \u03041 , x2 )/\u03c3(x1 , x2 ) = f (x\u03041 , x2 )/f (x1 , x2 ) 6= 1. Also because of that, it turns out that the sign (ori\u03c3(x\u0304\nentation) in the shift z \u2192 z\u00b1\u03c92 implementing the crossing transformation matters. The consistency\nof crossing transformations (8)-(9) with the unitarity condition demands us to define the shifts in\nthe two arguments of the bulk S-matrix with \"opposite\" signs10 . That is, for the two arguments\nin \u03c3(x1 , x2 ) \u2261 \u03c3(x(z1 ), x(z2 )), there are two equivalent ways in which crossing transformation can\nact:\n(+, \u2212) : z1 \u2192 z1 + \u03c92 ,\n\nz2 \u2192 z2 \u2212 \u03c92 ,\n\n(16)\n\n(\u2212, +) : z1 \u2192 z1 \u2212 \u03c92 ,\n\nz2 \u2192 z2 + \u03c92 .\n\n(17)\n\nFor definiteness, we will adhere to the convention (16) for the rest of this note. A class of consistent\ncrossing symmetric dressing factors satisfying (8), (9) and (11) were found in [11]. Moreover a\nunique special solution which correctly reproduces the weak coupling gauge theory results was\nfurther singled out in [12].\nFinally, one notes the discrete parity transformation can be imposed on the z-plane as z \u2192 \u2212z,\nsuch that:\nParity : x\u00b1 (\u2212z) = \u2212x\u2213 (z) .\n\n(18)\n\nIn terms of the magnon energy and momentum, this yields (E(\u2212z), p(\u2212z)) = (E(z), \u2212p(z)) as\nexpected.\nThe construction of the boundary reflection matrix R(x) proceeds in an almost identical way as\nfor the bulk scattering matrix S(x1 , x2 ) [14]. For the Y = 0 case, its form can again be constrained\nup to an overall scalar factor by demanding its invariance under the residual su(1|2)2 symmetry\nalgebra.

Similarly, if we demand that the singlet (21) scatters\ntrivially with the right boundary (as depicted in the lower right corner of each picture in Figure\n1), the relevant scattering process can be described as\n|1p,p\u0304 i \u2192 RR (p)S(p, \u2212p\u0304)RR (p\u0304)|1p,p\u0304 i =\n\nx\u2212 +\nx+ +\n\n1\nx\u2212\n1\nx+\n\nS0 (p, \u2212p\u0304)R0R (x)R0R (x\u0304)|1\u2212p\u0304,\u2212p i .\n\n(22)\n\nSymmetry under parity transformation of both, bulk and boundary scattering matrix, implies that\nthe reflection in the left boundary will contribute with the same factor and revert the singlet to its\noriginal orientation. This leads to a boundary crossing-symmetry condition for the factor R0R (p)\n[14]\nR20R (p)R20R (p\u0304) =\n\nx+ +\nx\u2212 +\n\n1\nx+\n1\nx\u2212\n\n\u03c3 2 (p, \u2212p\u0304) .\n\n(23)\n\nThis equation again needs to obey the unitarity constraint:\nR20R (p)R20R (\u2212p) = 1.\n7\n\n(24)\n\n\fAs we shall show momentarily, it will be crucial to consider the generalized rapidity z-plane coordinates and apply the crossing (15) transformation consistently in order to find the solution(s) to\n(23) and (24).\nEssentially, one needs to specify how to implement the crossing transformations in eq. (23), when\nwriting it in terms of the generalized rapidity z. The consistent choice of relative signs in the shifts\nwould be the one such that the action of the reflection is just flipping the sign of the rapidity. This\nmeans that, as shown in Figure 1 for instance, the argument of the boundary dressing factor for\nanti-particle p\u0304, has to be opposite in sign to the second argument of the bulk dressing factor. Thus,\nif taking p\u0304 as p(z + \u03c92 ) in the LHS of (23), the consistent choice is\nR20R (z)R20R (z + \u03c92 ) =\n\nx+ +\nx\u2212 +\n\n1\nx+\n1\nx\u2212\n\n12\n\n\u03c3 2 (z, \u2212z \u2212 \u03c92 ) .\n\n(25)\n\nBefore we present our proposed solution to the boundary crossing equation (25), let us first\ndemonstrate that a different choice of relative shift signs would have been inconsistent with unitarity. Consider for example\nR20R (z)R20R (z \u2212 \u03c92 ) =\n\nx+ +\nx\u2212 +\n\n1\nx+\n1\nx\u2212\n\n\u03c3 2 (z, \u2212z \u2212 \u03c92 ) .\n\n(26)\n\nWithout loss of generality we can write the boundary dressing factor R20R (z) as\nR20R (z) = F (z)\u03c3(\u2212z, z) ,\n\n(27)\n\nwhere \u03c3(z1 , z2 ) satisfies (8), (9) and (11). There are a few ways to motivate this. First in the\nso-called \"Giant Magnon regime\" [8, 23], the strong coupling computation using classical string\ntheory [14] shows that\nR20R (z) = eig\u03b80 (\u2212z,z)+O(1) ,\n\n(28)\n\nwhere log \u03c3(z1 , z2 ) = ig\u03b80 (z1 , z2 )+ O(1) is the leading dressing phase calculated originally in [10, 8].\nThe ans\u00e4tz (27) correctly captures the strong coupling result (28) provided log F (z) \u2192 O(1) as\ng \u2192 \u221e. Second, the factor \u03c3(p, \u2212p\u0304) on the RHS of (23) can be easily re-written in terms of \u03c3(\u2212z, z)\nprovided consistent crossing convention is taken, then we are the left with conditions for F (z).\nWith the ans\u00e4tz (27), the boundary crossing equation (26) would be written as\nF (z)F (z \u2212 \u03c92 )\u03c3(\u2212z, z)\u03c3(\u2212z + \u03c92 , z \u2212 \u03c92 ) =\n12\n\nx+ +\nx\u2212 +\n\n1\nx+\n1\nx\u2212\n\n\u03c3 2 (z, \u2212z \u2212 \u03c92 ) .\n\n(29)\n\nHere we have used the simplified notation \u03c3(z1 , z2 ) \u2261 \u03c3(x(z1 ), x(z2 )), R0R (z) \u2261 R0R (x(z)) and x\u00b1 as x\u00b1 (z) to\n\navoid overlong expressions.\n\n8\n\n\fThe successive application of (8)-(9), allows one to write\n(x+ +\nf (\u2212z + \u03c92 , z)\n\u03c3(\u2212z, z)\u03c3(\u2212z + \u03c92 , z \u2212 \u03c92 )\n=\n=\n\u03c3 2 (z, \u2212z \u2212 \u03c92 )\nf (z, \u2212z)2 f (\u2212z, z)\n\n1 3 \u2212\n) (x\nx+\n\n+ x1\u2212 )(x+ + x\u2212 )4\n.\n16(1 + x+ x\u2212 )4\n\n(30)\n\nTo satisfy (29) we would need to impose\nF (z)F (z \u2212 \u03c92 ) =\n\n16(1 + x+ x\u2212 )4\n.\n(x+ + x1+ )2 (x\u2212 + x1\u2212 )2 (x+ + x\u2212 )4\n\n(31)\n\nIt is important to notice that the RHS of (31) is crossing invariant. As a consequence,\nF (z \u2212 2\u03c92 ) = F (z) ,\n\n(32)\n\ni.e. the non-trivial factor due to double crossing the argument of R0R (z) is completely accounted\nby the shift on the factor \u03c3(\u2212z, z). Now if we apply the parity transformation z \u2192 \u2212z to (31) and\nuse unitarity condition F (z)F (\u2212z) = 1, we get\nF (\u2212z \u2212 \u03c92 )\n= +\nF (z)\n(x +\n\n16(1 + x+ x\u2212 )4\n,\n1 2 \u2212\n) (x + x1\u2212 )2 (x+ + x\u2212 )4\nx+\n\n(33)\n\nwhereas imposing unitarity only on the original (31) gives\nF (z)\n= +\nF (\u2212z + \u03c92 )\n(x +\n\n16(1 + x+ x\u2212 )4\n.\n+ x1\u2212 )2 (x+ + x\u2212 )4\n\n(34)\n\n1 2 \u2212\nx+ ) (x\n\nHowever (32) would then tell us\n\n(x+ +\n\n16(1 + x+ x\u2212 )4\n= 1,\n+ x1\u2212 )2 (x+ + x\u2212 )4\n\n(35)\n\n1 2 \u2212\n) (x\nx+\n\nwhich is clearly not the case for arbitrary x\u00b1 ! This lead us conclude that equations (33) and (34)\nare in obvious contradiction. This means that with the choice of shift signs (26), boundary crossing\nsymmetry and unitarity would be inconsistent with each other.\nNow let us see that when adopting the other choice of shift signs (25), which we argued to be\nthe consistent one, both boundary crossing equation and unitarity condition can be simultaneously\nsolved with ease. Using once again the ans\u00e4tz (27) we obtain\nF (z)F (z + \u03c92 )\u03c3(\u2212z, z)\u03c3(\u2212z \u2212 \u03c92 , z + \u03c92 ) =\n\nx+ +\nx\u2212 +\n\n1\nx+\n1\nx\u2212\n\n\u03c3 2 (z, \u2212z \u2212 \u03c92 ) .\n\n(36)\n\nAccording to (8) and (9),\nx+ +\n1\n\u03c3(\u2212z, z)\u03c3(\u2212z \u2212 \u03c92 , z + \u03c92 )\n=\n=\n\u03c3(z, \u2212z \u2212 \u03c92 )2\nf (z, \u2212z \u2212 \u03c92 )f (z + \u03c92 , \u2212z \u2212 \u03c92 )\nx\u2212 +\n\n9\n\n1\nx+\n1\nx\u2212\n\n.\n\n(37)\n\n\fThus we obtain the following crossing symmetry and unitarity conditions imposed on F (z)\nF (z)F (z + \u03c92 ) = 1 ,\nF (z)F (\u2212z) = 1 ,\n\n(38)\n\nThe system can be solved generally by F (z) = \u00b1 exp(ifodd (p)) where fodd (p) is an arbitrary odd\nfunction of the magnon momentum p, moreover at strong coupling when g \u2192 \u221e, log F (z) \u2192 O(1).\nBy further comparing with the weak coupling expression in (4.60) of [14] for R20R (z), this further\nrequires that F (z) \u2192 \u2212 exp(2ip) when g \u2192 0. Thus, the simplest solution for R20R (z) satisfying the\nY = 0 case crossing equation (23) and in agreement with the known strong/weak coupling results\nis:\nR20R (z) = \u2212 exp(2ip)\u03c3(\u2212z, z) \u2261 \u2212 exp(2ip(z))\u03c3(x(\u2212z), x(z)) .\n\n(39)\n\nLet us briefly comment on the uniqueness of (39). Recall that the factor \u03c3(p, \u2212p\u0304) entering in the\nRHS of (23) is unambiguously interpreted as the unique bulk dressing factor identified in [12]. We\nthen showed that R20R (z) is given in terms of \u03c3(\u2212z, z) satisfying (8)-(9). Therefore, for consistency,\nwe should also interpret \u03c3(\u2212z, z) to have exactly the same functional form as the unique bulk\ndressing factor identified in [12]. A good way to verify our solution would be to explicitly calculate\nthe leading semi-classical\n\n1\ng\n\ncorrection in R20R (z) by generalizing the worldsheet approach in [28]\n\nto the situation with open boundary conditions.\nWe end this note by considering also the crossing equation for the case Z = 0. Here the form\nof the boundary reflection matrix R(x) is again fixed up to an overall scalar factor R0R (x) by\ndemanding its invariance under the residual su(2|2)2 symmetry algebra [14],\n2\nRfull\nR (x) = R0R (x)R\u0302R\n\nsu(2|2)\n\nsu\u2032 (2|2)\n\n(x) \u2297 R\u0302R\nsu(2|2)\n\nBecause of the extra boundary degree of freedom, R\u0302R\n\n(x) .\n\n(40)\nsu\u2032 (2|2)\n\n(x) and R\u0302R\n\n(x) are now 16 \u00d7 16\n\nmatrices. They are non-diagonal and their complexity is similar to that of \u015csu(2|2) (x1 , x2 ). The\nexplicit expressions for their components are presented in (3.42)-(3.46) of [14] and they have also\nbeen checked to satisfy the boundary Yang-Baxter equations.\nAs done in [14] for the case Y = 0, we can use the reflection of the singlet state (21) to derive\na relevant crossing symmetry condition. Now from the factorizability, the scattering processes\ndisplayed in the right lower corner of Figure 1 consist of the action of three 16 \u00d7 16 dimensional\nscattering matrices. After a computationally intense calculation we obtain, regardless of the flavor\nof the boundary impurity, the following result for reflection of the singlet state:\nRR (p)S(p, \u2212p\u0304)RR (p\u0304)|1p,p\u0304 \u03c7R i =\n\nx\u2212 +\nx+ +\n\n1\nx\u2212\n1\nx+\n\nhB (p)S0 (p, \u2212p\u0304)R0R (x)R0R (x\u0304)|1\u2212p\u0304,\u2212p \u03c7R i ,\n10\n\n(41)\n\n\fwhere\nhB (p) =\nand xB =\n\ni\n2g (1+\n\nfactor R0R (p)\n\np\n\nx+ (xB \u2212 x\u2212 )\n1 + (xB x\u2212 x+ )2\n,\nx\u2212 (xB \u2212 x+ ) (1 \u2212 (xB x+ )2 )(1 \u2212 x\u2212 x+ )\n\n(42)\n\n1 + 4g 2 ). This leads to a crossing-symmetry condition for the boundary dressing\nR20R (p)R20R (p\u0304)\n\n=\n\nx+ +\nx\u2212 +\n\n1\nx+\n1\nx\u2212\n\n\u03c3 2 (p, \u2212p\u0304)\n.\nhB (p)2\n\n(43)\n\nAs a simple check for (43), one notices that in the leading g \u2192 \u221e expansion (or more precisely,\nthe giant magnon limit x\u00b1 \u223c e\u00b1ip/2 .), hB (x) \u2192 O(1) and then the classical dressing factor\nR20R (z) = eig\u03b80 (\u2212z,z)+2ig\u03b80 (\u03c91 /2,z)+O(1) ,\n\n(44)\n\ndeduced in [14] using the \"method of images\" satisfies the classical limit of the crossing equation\n(43). Up to the factor 1/hB (p)2 , one recognizes the crossing symmetry equation of the Y = 0 case,\nwhich we showed can be simply solved by \u03c3(\u2212z, z). Under crossing and unitarity conditions, the\nnaive ansatz R20R (z) = F (z)\u03c3(\u2212z, z) yields\nF (z)F (z + \u03c92 ) =\n\n1\n,\nhB (p(z))2\n\nF (z)F (\u2212z) = 1 .\n\n(45)\n\nand we have not attempted to solve this set of equations. One should also notice that hB (p(z))2\nis not crossing invariant, therefore the function F (z) still has a non-trivial monodromy, i.e. F (z +\n2\u03c92 ) 6= F (z), and then a non trivial crossing condition remains to be solved.\nAs a first step however, it would be very desirable to obtain the leading semiclassical correction\nto the boundary dressing factor in this Z = 0 case as in its closed string counterpart [25] and\ntest if crossing symmetry condition (43) is obeyed (c.f. [26]). In particular, in contrast with the\ncase Y = 0, here the boundary analogue of the magnon bound states exists [14, 27]. Therefore, it\nwould be interesting to generalize the constructions of multi-soliton solutions in [28, 29], also their\nclassical [30] and semiclassical scatterings [28] to the case with boundaries. Here the fluctuations\naround the soliton background would need to be subject to appropriate boundary conditions, this\ndirection is currently under investigation.\nThe authors would like to thank N.
