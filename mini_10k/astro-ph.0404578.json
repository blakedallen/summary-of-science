These theoretical relations match the general form of the observed relations well. This agreement\nis, to some extent, independent of the mass-luminosity relations used, pulsation code,\nnumerical techniques, details of the input physics and methods to convert theoretical\nquantities, such as bolometric luminosity and temperature, to observational quantities,\nsuch as V band magnitudes or (V \u2212 I) colours. We show that the period-colour and\namplitude-colour properties of fundamental mode Galactic Cepheids with periods such\nthat log(P ) > 0.8 can be explained by a simple application of the Stefan-Boltzmann\nlaw and the interaction of the photosphere with the hydrogen ionization front. We\ndiscuss the implications of our results for explaining the behavior of Galactic Cepheid\nperiod-colour, and period-luminosity relations at mean light.\nKey words: Cepheids \u2013 Stars: fundamental parameters\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nKanbur & Ngeow (2004, paper I, hereafter KN) presented\nnew observational characteristics of fundamental mode\nCepheids obtained from an analysis of the Galactic Cepheid\ndata and the OGLE LMC/SMC Cepheid data. These were\nthe period-colour (PC) and the amplitude-colour (AC) relations at maximum, mean and minimum light. KN analyzed\nthese PC and AC diagrams in the context of the work of\nSimon, Kanbur & Mihalas (1993, hereafter SKM), who used\nthe Stefan-Boltzmann law and the fact that radius fluctuations are small in Cepheids, to derive the following equation,\nvalid for optical pulsations of Cepheid variables:\nlog Tmax \u2212 log Tmin =\n\n1\n(Vmin \u2212 Vmax ),\n10\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Tmax/min is the photospheric temperature at maximum or minimum light. Consequently, if for some reason the\nPC relation is flat at maximum light, and the colour used is\na good predictor of temperature, then equation (1) predicts\na relationship between V band amplitude and Tmin , and\nthus a correlation between the V band amplitude and the\nobserved colour (after extinction correction) at minimum V\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: shashi@astro.umass.edu\n\nband light. Code (1947) found that Galactic Cepheids exhibit a spectral type that is independent of period at maximum light. SKM analyzed existing Galactic Cepheid data\nto show that higher amplitude Galactic Cepheids are indeed driven to cooler temperatures, and thus redder (B \u2212V )\ncolours, at minimum light in accordance with equation (1)\nand the observational findings of Code (1947).\nThe reason why Galactic Cepheids follow a spectral\ntype that is independent of period at maximum light was\nexplained in SKM: it is due to the interaction of the photosphere with the hydrogen ionization front (HIF). At maximum light, the HIF is so far out in the mass distribution\nthat the photosphere, taken to be optical depth 2/3, occurs right at the base of the HIF. Together with the HIF\nis a sharp rise in opacity. At this point, the mean free path\ngoes to zero. In the absence of any significant driving, even\nthough the surrounding atmosphere has a non-zero inward\nvelocity, this opacity wall prevents the photosphere from going deeper in the star and erases any \"memory\" of global\nstellar conditions. Thus for a large range of periods, the photosphere occurs at the base of the HIF at maximum light at\na temperature which is independent of period. At maximum\nlight, this leads to a flat relation between period & temperature, period & (B \u2212 V ) colour and period & spectral type,\nas seen in SKM. At other phases, the HIF lies too far in-\n\n\f2\n\nKanbur et al.\n\nside the mass distribution to interact with the photosphere.\nThis, together with equation (1), implies a relation between\namplitude and (B \u2212 V ) colour or temperature at minimum\nlight. Equation (1) suggests that if Tmin obeyed a flat relation with period, then there should be a relation between\namplitude and colour at maximum light. Hence PC relations\nare connected to AC relations, and changes in the PC relations should be reflected in corresponding changes in the\nAC relations.\nBecause of the extensive data now available, KN analyzed recent Galactic and Magellanic Cloud Cepheid data\nin terms of PC and AC diagrams at maximum, mean and\nminimum light. Using (V \u2212 I) colours, they performed a\nmore detailed analysis of the Galactic Cepheid data and\nfound that the Galactic PC relation at maximum light displayed a statistically significant break at 10 days, but was\nconsistent with a single line at mean and minimum light. In\nthe LMC, the PC relation displayed this break at all three\nphases, though the statistical significance at maximum light\nwas marginal. The SMC PC relation displayed similar properties to that in the Galaxy.\nAnalysis of the Galactic Cepheid data in terms of AC\ndiagrams confirmed the work of SKM, and extended it to\nthe case of (V \u2212 I) colour: there is a relation between amplitude and (V \u2212 I) colour at minimum V band light. For\nthe LMC, short period Cepheids (log(P ) < 1.0) show no\nrelation between V band amplitude and (V \u2212 I) colour at\nminimum light, but long period Cepheids (log(P ) > 1.0) are\nsuch that higher amplitude stars are driven to redder (V \u2212I)\ncolours and hence cooler temperatures at minimum light. At\nmaximum light, short period Cepheids are such that higher\namplitude stars are driven to bluer (V \u2212I) colours and hence\nhotter temperatures but long period Cepheids do not show\nsuch a relation.\nAn understanding of the PC and AC relations derived\nby KN are important, not only for stellar pulsation and evolution studies of Cepheids, but also because the Cepheid\nperiod-luminosity (PL) relation depends on the PC relation (see, e.g., Madore & Freedman 1991). The PL relation\nwill reflect significant changes in the PC relation. Hence in\nstudying PC and AC relations in different galaxies, we are\nstudying the universality of the Cepheid PL relation. Recent work by Tammann et al. (2002, 2003), Fouqu\u00e9 et al.\n(2003), Kanbur & Ngeow (2004), Ngeow & Kanbur (2004a),\nSandage et al. (2004) and Storm et al. (2004) have suggested that the PL relation in the Galaxy is significantly\ndifferent from that in the LMC and, further, that the\nPL relation in the LMC is non-linear. In contrast, current observations indicate that the Galactic PL relation\nis linear (Tammann et al. 2003; Kanbur & Ngeow 2004;\nNgeow & Kanbur 2004a).\nThe purpose of this and subsequent papers is to confront these new observed characteristics of Cepheids with\nthe latest stellar pulsation models and interpret the results\nin terms of the theory presented in SKM, which has been\nsummarized above. This approach will ultimately yield a\nqualitatively deeper understanding some of the reasons behind the variation of the Cepheid PL relation from galaxy to\ngalaxy. Our ultimate goal is to use our theoretical models to\nestimate the effect of this variation quantitatively. For this\npaper we concentrate on Galactic Cepheid models which we\ncompare with the same Galactic Cepheid data used in KN.\n\nThe LMC/SMC Cepheid models will be presented in the\nforthcoming papers in this series.\nOur models and methods improve upon those in SKM\nin the following respects: First of all, they contain a formulation to model time dependent turbulent convection\n(Yecko et al. 1999; Koll\u00e1th et al. 2002), in contrast to the\npurely radiative models used in SKM. In addition, we construct more models so that we can examine in greater detail the PC and AC characteristics of Cepheids. Secondly,\nwe investigate the pulsation properties as a function of\nother phase points. When investigating PC and AC relations at mean light, KN defined mean (V \u2212 I) colour as\nVmean \u2212 Iphmean where Vmean is the V band magnitude\nclosest to the value of A0 , the mean magnitude obtained\nfrom a Fourier decomposition, and Iphmean is the I band\nmagnitude at this same phase. The reason for doing this is\nbecause the colour of the star at a certain phase is precisely\nthe V band magnitude minus the I band magnitude at that\nsame phase. In contrast, a definition of mean colour such as\n< V > \u2212 < I > folds in the phase difference (albeit small)\nthat exists between the V and I band light curves. We adopt\nthe definitions given in KN for colour at maximum, mean\nand minimum light. However, there are two phases when\nthe V band magnitude is closest to the value of A0 : once\non the ascending branch and once on the descending branch\nof the light curve. The colour (or the temperature), in both\nmodels and theory, need not necessary be the same at these\ntwo phases. In KN's analysis of the observed data, the descending branch mean was adopted as the \"mean\". We pay\nspecific attention to this detail in our results and discussion\nsection. Finally, we look at (V \u2212 I) colours whereas SKM\nstudied predominantly (B \u2212 V ) colours. The (V \u2212 I) colour\nis a good indicator of temperature (Gonzalez & Wallerstein\n1996; Tammann et al. 2003) and is a crucial colour for the\nexisting calibration of the extra-galactic distance scale (e.g.,\nFreedman et al. 2001).\n\n2\n\nMODELS AND CODE DESCRIPTION\n\nThe numerical techniques and physics included in these\nmodels are detailed in Yecko et al. (1999) and Koll\u00e1th et al.\n(2002). The Florida code has been used successfully to model\ndouble mode Cepheid pulsations (Koll\u00e1th et al. 1998),\nGalactic first overtone Cepheids (Feuchtinger et al. 2000),\nCepheid mass-luminosity (ML) relations (Beaulieu et al.\n2001) and the study of Magellanic Clouds Cepheids\n(Buchler et al. 2004). The code takes the mass, luminosity,\neffective temperature, hydrogen and metallicity abundance\n(by mass), M, L, Te , X, Z, as input parameters. In this study,\nwe used (X, Z) = (0.70, 0.02) as a representation of Galactic hydrogen and metallicity abundance. For the remaining parameters, mass and luminosity are connected by an\nadopted ML relation, hence it is only necessary to choose\nthe mass and the effective temperature for computing a\nCepheid model. In this study, we used two ML relations,\nwhich are calculated from evolutionary models appropriate\nfor intermediate-mass stars:\n(i) The ML relation given by Chiosi (1989), which was\nalso used by Simon & Kanbur (1995) in their theoretical\n\n\fCepheid PC & AC relations II\nTable 1.

After a linear non-adiabatic analysis (Yecko et al.\n1999) which yields the normal mode spectrum, an initial perturbation, which is scaled to match the fundamental mode\nlinear velocity eigenvector, is applied and the model followed\nuntil a stable limit cycle is reached. In some cases, this means\nfollowing the pulsations for about 1000 cycles. This results\nin a full amplitude Cepheid oscillating in the fundamental\nmode. Following SKM, we can compute the temperature at\nan optical depth \u03c4 = 2/3 and also the temperature and\nopacity profiles as a function of depth at various phases of\nthe pulsation.\nIn addition to the two ML relations used, we have also\ncomputed two models using the parameters (M, L, Te ) from\ntable 1 of SKM, in order to compare the results based on\npurely radiative and the turbulent convective models, and\nfurther broaden the range of ML relation considered. The\n\n\fKanbur et al.\n\n4\n\ninput parameters for these models and for the two ML relations used are presented in Table 1.\nWe compare theoretical quantities to observable quantities using a number of prescriptions:\n(i) We convert observed, extinction corrected (V \u2212 I) to\n(B \u2212 V ) colours using the formula given in Tammann et al.\n(2003), and then convert the (B \u2212 V ) index to temperatures\nusing the formula given in SKM.\n(ii) We use the BaSeL atmosphere database1 (Lejeune\n2002; Westera et al. 2002) to construct a fit giving temperature as a function of (V \u2212I) colour, with and without a log(g)\nterm. Where a log(g) term is used, we obtain this, at the appropriate phase, from the models. This database is also used\nin, for example, Beaulieu et al. (2001) and Cordier et al.\n(2003) for the study of Magellanic Cloud Cepheids.\n(iii) These techniques were also used to obtain the\nbolometric corrections required to convert theoretical luminosity curves into theoretical V band light curves.\nSimon & Kanbur (1995) have shown that these corrections\nare small.\nThe qualitative thrust of our results does not change according to the details of the method used to convert colours\nto temperatures and luminosity to V band light. In what\nfollows, we report on results using method (ii) above with\na log(g) term. One caveat here is that we use hydrostatic\nequilibrium atmospheres. The effective temperature and effective gravity for these atmospheres are obtained from the\nrelevant quantities at the photosphere in the models. For the\neffective gravity we use\n\ng\n\n=\n\nGM\ndu\n\u2212\n,\nR2\ndt\n\nwhere du/dt is again given by the instantaneous structure\nof the models. Such an approach has been widely used in\nthe literature in recent years for both Cepheids and RR\nLyraes (see, for examples, SKM, Simon & Kanbur 1995,\nBono et al. 1999, Sandage et al. 1999, Beaulieu et al. 2001,\nCaputo et al. 2002, Kov\u00e1cs 2003, Ruoppo et al. 2004). Some\njustification based on detailed modeling may be found in\nKoll\u00e1th et al. (2000) and Keller & Mutschlecner (1970). We\nnote that at most phases the du/dt term is small but can\nbecome large at certain phases during the ascending and\ndescending branches. For the models considered here, this\noccurs for three models with log(P ) between 1.5 and 1.65 at\nphases close to maximum light.\n\n3\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe results from the model calculations are summarized in\nTable 1, 2 and 3. Table 1 gives the input parameters, as well\nas the computed periods and growth rates from the linear\nnon-adiabatic analysis for the fundamental and first overtone modes for the models constructed in this paper. We\nnote that the models used generally had reasonably high\nfundamental mode growth rates and negative first overtone\n\n1\n\nhttp://www.astro.mat.uc.pt/BaSeL/\n\ngrowth rates. This puts our models well inside the fundamental mode instability strip for all periods considered. Table 2 gives the temperatures at the maximum/minimum\nluminosity at full amplitude for the corresponding models\nin Table 1. Table 3 gives similar quantities but for the ascending and descending branch means. In Table 3, < L >\nis the average luminosity obtained from the light curve in\none pulsating cycle. Lmean is the luminosity that is obtained from the closest temporal grid points (from the light\ncurve) to the < L >, on both of the ascending and descending branches. Tmean are the corresponding temperatures at\nthese grid points. Since < L > and Lmean may not be equal\nto each other, we obtain the temperatures that correspond\nto < L > by interpolation between Lmean and the adjacent\nluminosity that bracket the < L >. These temperatures are\ninter\nreferred as Tmean\nin Table 3. Note that the temperatures\nat mean light on the descending branch is normally cooler\nthan the mean light temperatures on the ascending branch.\n\n3.1\n\nThe PC relations\n\nIn this subsection we compare the PC relations from the\nmodel calculations and the observations. Figure 1 shows a\nfour panel plot of log-period against extinction corrected\n(V \u2212 I) colour for Galactic Cepheids as given in KN. Superimposed on this are values obtained from our models,\nwhere the theoretical temperatures are converted to (V \u2212 I)\ncolours using method (ii) described above. The solid and\nopen squares represent models based on the Chiosi (1989)\nand Bono et al. (2000) ML relations respectively, whereas\nthe solid circles refer to models computed with the ML relation used in SKM. The left panels are for maximum (top)\nand minimum (bottom) light respectively, whilst the right\npanels are for the means of the ascending and descending\nbranches, respectively. We see that there is very good agreement between models and observations in this diagram. Figure 2 shows the same quantities but on the log(P )-log(T )\nplane. The observed (V \u2212I) colours for the Galactic Cepheid\ndata are converted to the temperature by using the BaSeL\ndatabase mentioned in previous section, where the log(g)\nterms for the observed colours are approximated by using\nlog(g) = 2.62 \u2212 1.21 log(P ) (Beaulieu et al. 2001). We note\nthat the qualitative nature of our results is the same in Figure 1 and 2: the flat nature of the relation at maximum\nlight, the non-zero slope at minimum light and an amalgam\nof these at mean light.\nRecall that KN analyzed a large sample of Galactic\nCepheid data and showed that the PC relation was consistent with a single line at mean and minimum light, but at\nmaximum light there was significant statistical evidence for\na break at 10 days. Figures 1 & 2 suggests that this break\nactually occurs at log(P ) \u2248 0.8. As in KN, we can perform\na two line regression, for Cepheids with periods smaller and\ngreater than log(P ) = 0.8, and compare with a one line regression across the entire period range. This is what is meant\nby short and long period in the following paragraph. Table 4\nshows the phase, overall dispersion, slope and error at that\nphase and then these same quantities for the short and long\nperiod Cepheids respectively. From Figure 2 and Table 4,\nwe can conclude the following results:\n(i) The overall slope in the log(P )-log(T ) plane at maxi-\n\n\fCepheid PC & AC relations II\n\nMAX\n\nMEAN (asc)\n\n1.2\n\n1\n\n5\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n1.4\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nMIN\n\n2\n\n1.2\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nMEAN (dec)\n\n2\n\n1.2\n1\n1\n0.8\n0.8\n0.6\n0.6\n0.4\n0.4\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nlog(P)\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nlog(P)\n\nFigure 1.

The V band amplitude-colour (AC) relations for the Galactic Cepheids. The symbols are same as in Figure 1. The bolometric\nmodel light curves are converted to V band light curves with the bolometric corrections obtained from BaSeL database. Left (a): AC\nrelations at maximum and minimum light; Right (b): AC relation at mean light, for both of the acceding and descending branches. .\n\nat a period of 10 days, we find that in the log(P )-log(T )\nplane, even at maximum light, the data are consistent with\na single line. Thus the broken PC relation at maximum light\nfor Galactic Cepheids described by KN is due primarily to\nthe different PC relation obeyed by short (log(P ) < 0.8)\nperiod, fundamental mode Cepheids.\nWe note that this good agreement exists for maximum, mean and minimum light. The exception is perhaps\nthe longer period models constructed with the Bono et al.\n(2000) ML relation, with log(P ) > 1.3, at maximum light.\nWe discuss these models in Section 4. Since the observed\ndata exhibit very similar characteristics in both periodcolor and period-temperature planes, that is, a distinctly\nnon-linear relation with a sudden break at a period of\n0.75 < log(P ) < 1.0 and since the models agree well with\nthe data, it follows that existing models contain the physics\nto explain these observations. We study this in Section 3.3\n3.2\n\nThe AC relations\n\nFigure 3 depicts plots of the AC relations for both models\nand data, at maximum, minimum, ascending and descending branch means. The bolometric corrections obtained from\nthe BaSeL database are used to construct the V band amplitudes from the model light curves. We see good agreement\nbetween models and data in these diagrams, though models\nconstructed with our code using the Bono et al. (2000) ML\nrelation have smaller amplitudes even though these models match observations in the AC diagrams. Models constructed using the Chiosi (1989) ML relation with our code\ngenerally have larger amplitudes. We caution here that the\ncomputed amplitudes, unlike the periods, depend strongly\non the strength of the artificial viscosity and of the assumed\nturbulent eddy viscosity.\n\nTable 5 gives the results from a linear regression of V\nband amplitude against log T at the three phases of interest\nfor the Galactic Cepheid data, taken from Figure 2 & 3.\nEquation (1) shows that, if the variation of log Tmax with\nperiod has a shallow slope close to zero, then an equation of\nthe form log Tmin = a + bVamp is such that b is about \u22120.10.\nFrom Table 5, we see that the overall slope is \u22120.079, which\nis very close to the theoretically expected value. Accounting\nfor the error on the slope shows that the actual slope is\nstatistically indistinguishable from the theoretical value of\n\u22120.10. In addition, Table 5 implies that the overall slope\nfor Vamp -log Tmax relation is close to zero across the entire\nperiod range. This strongly supports the validity of equation\n(1) and our interpretation of the predictions arising from this\nequation if either log Tmax or log Tmin obey a flat relation\nwith period. Figure 4 argues this graphically with a two\npanel plot displaying V band amplitude against log Tmin\nand log Tmax on the left and right panels, respectively. An\nAC relation may also occur if either log Tmax or log Tmin has\na shallower relation with period than the other quantity.\n\n3.3\n\nThe interaction of the HIF and photosphere\n\nIn Figures 5-7, we present the plots of the temperature and\nopacity profiles, i.e. temperature and log opacity against location in the mass distribution respectively, for a representative selection of the models in Table 1. We display plots for a\nlong period (log(P ) > 1.0), short period (log(P ) < 1.0) and\na 10 day period model. The mass distribution is measured\nby the quantity Q = log(1 \u2212 Mr /M ), where Mr is the mass\nwithin radius r and M is the total mass. Each panel shows\nthe temperature and opacity profiles at maximum, mean and\nminimum light with dotted, solid and dashed curves, respectively.

The photosphere is marked with a filled circle\nin these figures. Figure 8 illustrates the luminosity and temperature profiles against mass distribution in one pulsating\ncycle.\nIn general, the HIF sweeps back and forth in the mass\ndistribution as the star pulsates. A naive way of thinking\nabout this would be that the HIF is furthest out and furthest\nin, in the mass distribution, at maximum and minimum light\nrespectively (SKM). Our models indicate that the situation\nis more complicated than this, and we summarize the main\nresults from Figure 5-7 as follow:\n\n1.2\nFar away from HIF\n1\n|-\n\n-|\n\n0.8\nlocation of HIF\n0.6\n\n0.4\n-6\n\n-5.5\n\n-5\n\n-4.5\n\n-4\n\n1.2\nAt the base of HIF\n1\n\n(i) At minimum light, the photosphere is closest to the\nHIF at short period but moves progressively away from the\nbase of the HIF as the model period increases. This is in\nconcordance with the lowest panel of Figures 1 and 2 which\ndisplay the period temperature relation for models and data\nas one single line such that longer period models have cooler\nphotospheric temperatures at minimum light. However, at\nmaximum light, the photosphere lies at the base of the of\nthe HIF for all the models presented.\n(ii) We can quantify this by defining the quantity \u2206 to be\nthe \"distance\", in units of Q, between the photosphere and\nthe point in the HIF where dT /dQ is a maximum. Figure 9\nillustrates this and Figure 10 portrays the results when we\nplot \u2206 against log(P ) at maximum, minimum and the ascending and descending branch means. In Figure 10, the error bars are estimated from the coarseness of the grid points\naround the location of HIF. We see clearly that at maximum light, \u2206 is constant over a large period range, whereas\nat minimum light, \u2206 gets larger as the period increases.\nThe value of \u2206 at the phases of ascending and descending\nbranch means is a mixture of the behavior at maximum and\nminimum light. There is an indication that for long period\nmodels (log(P ) > 1.3) at maximum light, the photosphere\nstarts to become disengaged from the base of the HIF. As the\nperiod increases, so does the L/M ratio and, in general, the\neffective temperatures become lower. Kanbur (1995) showed\nthat such changes push the HIF further inside the mass distribution, making it harder to interact with the photosphere\neven at maximum light when it is closer to the surface. This\ncan cause a non-zero slope in the log(P )-log(Tmax ) plane at\nlong periods. This was also noted by SKM.\n(iii) The HIF at mean light is not always between its locations at maximum or mean light. Figure 8 illustrates our\npoint and shows various locations on the ascending and descending branch of a typical light curve from our models.\nThe lower two panels show the temperature profile at each\nof these phases. We see that the HIF at phase b is actually\nfurther out in the mass distribution than at maximum light\nand conversely the HIF is further in in the mass distribution\nat the phase corresponding to mean light on the descending\nbranch than at minimum light. Moreover, the nature and\nshape of the HIF seems to change significantly during the\npulsation period.\n(iv) At short/long period, the HIF at ascending/descending branch mean light is located in front/behind\nits location at maximum/minimum light.\n(v) We also note that the nature of the HIF changes\nwhen it is located outside of its locations at either maximum or minimum light. These changes in the HIF occur\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n-6.5\n\n-6\n\n-5.5\n\n-5\n\n-4.5\n\n-4\n\nFigure 9. Illustration of the location of HIF and photosphere,\nand the way to calculate \u2206. The crosses represent the zones in\nthe model calculations. The location of the photosphere, at \u03c4 =\n2/3, and the HIF are marked with filled circles. The location of\nthe HIF is defined as the zone with the steepest gradient in the\ntemperature profile. Therefore, \u2206 is the \"distance\" (in terms of\nlog[1 \u2212 Mr /M ]) between the photosphere and HIF. Upper and\nlower panels illustrate the cases that the photosphere is far away\nand close to the HIF, respectively.\n\nat period ranges corresponding to the location of bumps on\nthe ascending or descending branches of the light curve: the\nHertzsprung progression.\n(vi) If we define \"amplitude of HIF oscillation\" as the\nrange of log(1 \u2212 Mr /M ) values occupied by the HIF, then\nthere is a correlation between this and the resulting amplitude of the photospheric light curve.\n3.4\n\nCepheids with log(P ) < 0.8\n\nFigure 1 and the results of Tables 4 & 5 suggest that\nCepheids with log(P ) < 0.8 do not obey a flat relation with\nperiod at maximum light. Our current grid of models does\nnot include any models with such periods, but Figures 10\ndoes indicate that the photosphere will be located at the\nbase of the HIF at all phases of pulsation as is the case with\nRRab stars (Kanbur 1995; Kanbur & Phillips 1996). Figure\n10 also indicates that as the period gets shorter the \"distance\" in the mass distribution between the HIF and the\nphotosphere is the same at maximum and minimum light.\nThis does not necessarily mean that there will be a flat PC\nrelation at both these phases as explained by Kanbur (1995)\nand Kanbur & Phillips (1996) for the case of RRab stars.\nThese short period, fundamental mode Cepheids will be investigated in a future paper.\n\n4\n\nLIGHT CURVE STRUCTURE\n\nIt is desirable to compare the theoretical light curves from\nmodels quantitatively to the observed light curves, for example by Fourier decomposition (Payne-Gaposhkin 1947;\n\n\fCepheid PC & AC relations II\n\n3.8\n\n3.8\n\n3.75\n\n3.75\n\n3.7\n\n3.7\n\n3.65\n\n3.65\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\nV amplitude\n\n1\n\n9\n\n1.5\n\nV amplitude\n\nFigure 4.

In lower panels, the dashed curves represent the temperature profiles at maximum and minimum light, while the solid curves\nrepresent the temperature profiles at other phases as indicated in upper panels.\n\nment between models and observations when we use the\nChiosi ML relation (equation [2]). These diagrams also illustrate that the agreement between models and data in the\nlog(P )-temperature or log(P )-colour plane is a necessary,\nbut not sufficient, condition for agreement between observed\nand theoretical light curves. This also emphasizes that the\nphysical effect of interest in this paper - the interaction of\nthe photosphere and HIF - is a fundamental physical effect\nwhich is, to some extent, independent of the ML relation\nused.\n\n5\n\nCONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe Florida code used in this study contains a recipe\nto calculate the time dependent turbulent convection whilst\nSKM found a similar result using a purely radiative, dynamically zoned code. Our results imply that this interaction is also independent of numerical techniques and physics\nincluded in the code. What is needed is the presence of hydrogen and an accurate description of the opacity when hydrogen starts to ionize.\n\nBy looking at the way the Cepheid photosphere, the region\nwhere the Cepheid continuum is generated, interacts with\nthe HIF, we have provided a simple qualitative physical explanation for the observed PC properties of fundamental\nmode Galactic Cepheids with log(P ) > 0.8. This explanation relies on the fact that the opacity in a Cepheid becomes\nvery high when hydrogen starts to ionize. This acts as a wall\nand prevents the photosphere going any deeper, and leads to\na flat relation between period and temperature at the phase\nwhen the HIF interacts with the photosphere. For Galactic Cepheids this is observed at maximum light. At other\nphases, the photosphere is located away from the opacity\nwall and its temperature is related to the global properties\nof the star and hence its period. This explains, convincingly,\nwhy the Galactic Cepheid period-temperature relation is flat\nat maximum light and has a non-zero, single slope at mean\nand minimum light.\n\nAt first sight, the left panels of Figure 11 might lead one\nto question the ML relation in equation (3). However, the\nnumerical recipe to model convection contains seven dimensionless parameters (the \u03b1 parameters, Yecko et al. 1999),\nmany of which can influence the amplitude. A more detailed study and comparison of the effect of ML relations\nmay remove this discrepancy. For example, the two models\nconstructed with the ML relation used in SKM, shown as\nblack dots in Figure 11, do lie closer to the observations in\nthe Fourier plane. This may also explain the discrepancy\nbetween observations and theory in the log(P )-(V \u2212 I)max\nplane for log(P ) > 1.3 when the Bono et al. (2000) ML relation is used.\n\nThe qualitative nature of this idea remains true whether\nthe pulsation code is purely radiative (as in SKM), or has\na numerical recipe to model time dependent turbulent convection as in this work. The interaction between the photosphere and HIF may also provide some explanation for the\nsuggestion made by Kervella et al. (2004), that the region\nwhere spectral lines are formed do not necessary move homologously with the region where the K-band continuum is\nformed. In addition, because we have used two ML relations\nwith a wide range of L/M ratio in our study, and because the\nsame physical effect is present in models constructed with\neither relation, the qualitative nature of our result is independent of the ML relation used. However, the ML relation\nused and its variation with metallicity, will dictate how the\n\n\fKanbur et al.\n\n12\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0\n0.5\n\n1\n\n0\n0.5\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nlog(P)\n\nlog(P)\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0\n0.5\n\n1\n\n0\n0.5\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nlog(P)\n\nlog(P)\n\nFigure 10.

In the next\npaper in this series, we will investigate how these ideas can\nbe used to explain the PC, AC and PL properties of fundamental mode LMC Cepheids.\n\nwith log(P ) < 0.8. These short period stars follow distinctly\ndifferent PC relations and deserve further detailed study.\n\nWe have also found evidence that the non-linear nature of the Galactic PC relation at maximum light reported\nby KN is due to short period fundamental mode Cepheids\n\nWhat bearing do the results of this paper have on the\nCepheid PC and PL relations at mean light? It is clear that\nPC relations at different phases contribute to the PC rela-\n\n5.1\n\nThe effect on the PL relation\n\n\fCepheid PC & AC relations II\ntion at mean light. If we choose (V \u2212 I)i as the extinction\ncorrected colour at phase i, then a PC relation at this phase\nis:\n(V \u2212 I)i = ai + bi log(P ),\nand taking the average over a pulsation period, i = 1...N ,\nthis becomes:\n\n< V > \u2212 < I >=\n\ni=N\ni=N\n1 X\n1 X\nai +\nbi log(P ).\nN\nN\ni=1\n\n(5)\n\ni=1\n\nIt is clear that the average intercept and slope will be\naffected by their values at individual phase points such\nas maximum or minimum light. Ngeow & Kanbur (2004b)\ncompute PC relations for Galactic and Magellanic Cloud\nCepheids at all phases between 0 and 1 and show that,\nfor example for Galactic Cepheids, as the phase approaches\nmaximum light, the slope of the PC relation becomes flatter.\nSince the mean light PC relation affects the mean light PL\nrelation (Madore & Freedman 1991), our aim of understanding the reasons behind changes in the PC and AC relations\nat different phases has a direct bearing on understanding at\nleast one cause of the possible variation of the mean light\nCepheid PL relation from galaxy to galaxy. Below we outline how our results are pertinent to studies of the variability\nof the Cepheid PL relation from galaxy to galaxy, though\nwe emphasize that much of this discussion is dependent on\ntheoretical model and data analysis currently being undertaken. Hence the following discussion is a road-map of some\naspects of our future work.\nThe evidence that shows the slope of the LMC\nPL relation at mean light is significantly different\nto the slope of the mean light PL relation in the\nGalaxy has been provided in Tammann et al. (2003),\nNgeow & Kanbur (2004a) and Storm et al. (2004). Furthermore, the mean light LMC PL relation suffers a change\nat a period of 10 days whilst the mean light Galactic PL relation data is consistent with a single slope\nwith current data (Tammann et al. 2003; Fouqu\u00e9 et al.\n2003; Kanbur & Ngeow 2004; Ngeow & Kanbur 2004a;\nSandage et al. 2004; Storm et al. 2004).\nTo understand the effect of the PC relation on the PL\nrelation, consider the period-luminosity-color (PLC) relation\nvalid at any phase:\nMv = a + b log(P ) + c(V \u2212 I).\nIf the PC relation is broken, say at a period P0 , then we\nhave:\n(V \u2212 I) = x + y log(P ), P < P0 .\n(V \u2212 I) = x\u2032 + y \u2032 log(P ), P > P0 .\nSubstituting these two equations into the PLC relation leads\nto two PL relations:\nMv = a + cx + (b + cy) log(P ), P < P0 .\nMv = a + cx\u2032 + (b + cy \u2032 ) log(P ), P > P0 .\nHence changes in the slope and intercept of the PC relation\nhave a direct bearing on the slope and intercept of the PL\nrelation. However, the results from this paper and also from\nKN and Ngeow & Kanbur (2004b) imply that the mean light\n\n13\n\nPC relation is affected by changes in the PC relation at different phases during a pulsation cycle, as given in equation\n(5). Thus the study of PC relations at various phases impacts on the variability of the mean light PL relation from\ngalaxy to galaxy.\nIn this paper, we have updated and extended the work\nof SKM to provide an account of a simple physical mechanism, the interaction of the photosphere and HIF, which can\nchange the properties of PC relations for Galactic Cepheids\nand so affect the PL relation. Specifically, a new result of\nour work is that for Galactic Cepheids with log(P ) > 0.8,\nthe maximum light PC relation is flat, i.e., the HIF and\nphotosphere are engaged at maximum light. We also study\nthe changes in AC relations because they are linked to PC\nrelations through equation (1). A flat PC relation at maximum light leads to an AC relation at minimum light of slope\n\u2248 \u22120.1 from equation (1), as seen in Figure 4 and Table 5.\nHowever, a Cepheid in the LMC will have a different ML\nrelation, usually in the sense that LMC ML relations have\nhigher L/M ratios. Then in order to compare Galactic and\nLMC Cepheids of the same period, the LMC Cepheid needs\nto be hotter (KN). Kanbur (1995) and Kanbur & Phillips\n(1996) found that such changes in the (M, L, Te ) triplet\ndescribing the model changes the relative location of the\nHIF and hence the phase and the range of periods at which\nthey interact. Our hypothesis is that for LMC models, it\nis only after log(P ) > 1.0 that the HIF and photosphere\nare engaged at phases around maximum light, leading to\na flat PC relation. This flat PC relation for long period\n(log(P ) > 1.0) LMC Cepheids is one cause for the nonlinear nature of the mean light LMC PL relation (KN). Empirically, Ngeow & Kanbur (2004b) provide preliminary evidence that the LMC PC relation is flat only for log(P ) > 1.0\nwhereas this crossover period is log(P ) \u2248 0.8 in the case of\nthe Galaxy. In case of SMC Cepheids, KN also provide evidence that the maximum light PC relation is not flat even for\nlong period Cepheids. Our contention is, using some of the\nresults of this paper, that amplitudes in SMC Cepheids are\nnot high enough to force an interaction between the photosphere and HIF, as the SMC Cepheids have lower amplitudes\nthan the LMC (Paczy\u0144sky & Pindor 2000). This again must\nwait confirmation from a new set of SMC models.\nThe final effect on PL relations at mean light will depend on the behavior at other phases, such as minimum\nlight. For example, preliminary calculations to be presented\nin a future paper imply that certain changes seen in the PC\nrelation at minimum light (KN) may correspond to the first\novertone mode becoming stable. Not surprisingly, a thorough quantitative study of this must await the analysis of\nLMC and SMC Cepheid models, which are currently under\nconstruction. The details of the influence of flat/non-flat PC\nrelations on the mean PC and PL relations, the crossover period of P0 that could vary from galaxy to galaxy, and the\ncomparison of PL relations at maximum and minimum light\nfor different galaxies are beyond the scope of this paper, and\nwill be presented in the future papers.\nGroenewegen et al. (2004) recently reported a metallicity dependence in the zero point of Cepheid PL relation at\nmean light. They used 34 Galactic Cepheids with individual\nmetallicity measurements and then supplemented this sample with primarily long period Magellanic Cloud Cepheids\nto show the existence of a quadratic term in log(P ) in the\n\n\f14\n\nKanbur et al.\n\nPL relation. When they used primarily Galactic Cepheids\nin their sample, they found no evidence of a quadratic term.\nThey interpreted these results as being due to a metallicity dependent zero point in the PL relation. These results\nare also consistent with the Cepheid LMC PL relation having different slopes for long and short period Cepheids as\nsuggested by KN and Sandage et al. (2004). Sandage et al.\n(2004) also plotted amplitude-mean colour relations in luminosity bins. However, KN's AC relations were along the\ninstability strip. It will be interesting to apply the precepts\nbehind equation (1) and multi-phase AC relations in luminosity and/or period bins, that is, across the instability strip.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work has been supported in part by NSF (AST\n0307281) to JRB.
