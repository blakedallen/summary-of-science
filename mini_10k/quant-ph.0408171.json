According to one of the basic assumptions of quantum mechanics,\nthe achievable information about the state of a physical system is encoded in the\ndensity matrix \u03c1, which allows one to evaluate all possible expectation values of\nobservables trough the formula\nh Q i = Tr (\u03c1Q) ,\n1\n\n(11)\n\n\fwhere Q is a self-adjoint operator representing a particular physical quantity.\nThus, in order to have full information about a given quantum system we\nneed to know its density matrix \u03c1. In particular, a very useful tool in this regard\nis quantum state tomography (QST) which provides means for the complete\nreconstruction of the density matrix for a qudit (or a set of qubits). The general\nprocedure relies on the ability to reproduce a large number of identical states\nand to perform a series of measurements on complementary aspects of the state\nwithin an ensemble.\nSuppose that we can prepare a quantum system repeatedly in the same state\nand make a series of experiments such that we can measure the expectation\nvalues\nEt (Q) = Tr (Q\u03c1(t))\n(12)\nof some observables Q1 , . . . , Qn at different time moments t1 < t2 < . . . < tr .\nThe fundamental question arises:\nCan we find the average value of any desired operator from the set of measured\noutcomes of a given set Q1 , . . . , Qn\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\nEt1 (Q1 ) * * * Etr (Q1 )\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n..\n..\n(13)\n\uf8fb,\n\uf8f0\n.\n***\n.\nEt1 (Qn ) * * * Etr (Qn )\n\nwhere 0 \u2264 t1 < . . . < tr \u2264 T , for an interval [0, T ]?\nAmong the existing tomographic techniques for quantum systems, the socalled homodyne tomography has received much attention in the literature\n[1, 2, 3]. In the phase-space formulation of quantum mechanics there is a oneto-one relation between a quantum state and the so-called Wigner function.\nIts marginals are accessible experimentally, and an inverse (Radon) transformation allows one to reconstruct the phase-space distribution associated with the\nunknown quantum state.\nThe question of how to reconstruct states of d-level systems (qudits) is also\nnatural. In this case various methods have been proposed to determine \u03c1 [4,\n5, 6]. If the problem under consideration is static, then the state of a d-level\nopen quantum system (a qudit) can be uniquely determined only if n = d2 \u2212\n1 expectation values of linearly independent observables are at our disposal.\nHowever, if we assume that we know the dynamics of our system, i.e. we know\nthe generator of the time evolution, then we can use the stroboscopic approach\nbased on (13). In general, the term \"tomography\" will be used collectively to\ndenote any kind of state-reconstruction method.\nWith reference to the terminology used in the system theory, we assume the\nfollowing definition:\nDefinition 1 A d-level open quantum system S is said to be (Q1 , . . . , Qn )reconstructible on an interval [0, T ], if there exists at least one set of time\ninstants 0 \u2264 t1 < . . . < tr \u2264 T such that the state trajectory can be uniquely\n2\n\n\fdetermined by the correspondence\n[0, T ] \u220b tj 7\u2212\u2192 Etj = Tr (\u03c1(tj )Qi )\n\n(14)\n\nfor i = 1, . . . , n, j = 1, . . . , r.\nThe above definition is equivalent to the following one\nDefinition 2 A d-level open quantum system S is said to be (Q1 , . . . , Qn )reconstructible on an interval [0, T ], if for every two trajectories with distinct\ninitial states there exists at least one t\u0302 \u2208 [0, T ] and at least one operator Qk \u2208\n{Q1 , . . . , Qn } such that\nTr (Qk \u03c11 (t\u0302)) 6= Tr (Qk \u03c12 (t\u0302)) .\n\n(15)\n\nRemark 1 In the above definitions we assume that the time evolution of the\nsystem is given in terms of a completely positive semigroup of operators. Arguments in favour of completely positive semigroups as the foundation of nonHamiltonian dynamics as well as the discussion of properties of such semigroups\ncan be found in papers of Kraus [7], Lindblad [8], and Gorini et al. [9].\nIn particular, in Lindblad's paper [8] the general form of the generator of\nan arbitrary completely positive semigroup was derived. A linear operator L\nd\nd\non a set of linear operators B(H) := M (C ), where H \u2243 C is a d-dimensional\nHilbert space and M denotes the set of matricies with complex entries, proves\nto be the generator of a completely positive semigroup if and only if it can be\nrepresented in the form\n\u0011\n1 X\u0010\n[Vj \u03c1, Vj\u2217 ] + [Vj , \u03c1Vj\u2217 ] ,\n2 j=1\n\u03ba\n\nL\u03c1 = \u2212i[H, \u03c1] +\n\n(16)\n\nwhere Vj \u2208 B(H) for j = 1, . . . , \u03ba, and H is a self-adjoint operator also belonging\nto B(H) (cf. also [10]).\nRemark 2 It is important that for the number r of time instants t1 , . . . , tr we\ndo not formulate any restriction (except that it is finite).\nRemark 3 The question of obvious physical interest is to find the minimal\nnumber of observables Q1 , . . . , Q\u03b7 for which the d-level quantum system S with\nthe generator L can be (Q1 , . . . , Q\u03b7 )-reconstructible. It can be shown that if\nthe time evolution of the system S is described by the master equation,\nd\n\u03c1(t) = L\u03c1(t) ,\ndt\n\nthen there exists [4, 5] a set of observables Q1 , . . . , Q\u03b7 , where\nn\no\n\u03b7 = max dim Ker (\u03bb1l \u2212 L)\n\u03bb\u2208\u03c3(L)\n\n(17)\n\n(18)\n\nsuch that the system S is (Q1 , . . . , Q\u03b7 )-reconstructible. Moreover, if we have\ne1, . . . , Q\ne \u03b7\u0303 with this property, then \u03b7\u0303 \u2265 \u03b7. The\nanother set of observables Q\nnumber \u03b7 given by (18) we will call the index of cyclicity of the system S.\n3\n\n\f2\n\nPolynomial Representation of Flows\n\nThe main idea of the stroboscopic approach to quantum tomography is based\non the polynomial representation of the flow defined by the general master\nequation. Namely, we have\n\u03a6(t) = exp(Lt) =\n\nm\u22121\nX\n\nk\n\n\u03b1k (t)L ,\n\n(21)\n\nk=0\n\nwhere by Cauchy's theorem\n1\n\u03b1k (t) :=\n2\u03c0i\n\nI\n\n\u03bck (z)\nexp(tz) dz .\n\u03bc(z, L)\n\n\u2202D\n\n(22)\n\nIn the above expression \u2202D is any simple closed contour enclosing the spectrum\nof the operator L in the complex plane and\n\u03bc(z, L) =\n\nm\u22121\nX\n\ndk z k\n\n(23)\n\nk=0\n\ndenotes the minimal polynomial of the generator L. It is interesting that there\nare ways to compute the functions \u03b1k (t) in (21) without summing the exponential series or without knowing the Jordan canonical form of L. Namely,\ndifferentiating (21) with respect to t and using the minimal polynomial of L\none finds that the functions \u03b1k (t) for k = 0, . . . , m \u2212 1 satisfy the system of\nequations\nd\u03b10 (t)\n=\ndt\nd\u03b11 (t)\n=\ndt\n***\nd\u03b1m\u22121 (t)\n=\ndt\n\nd0 \u03b1m\u22121 (t) ,\n\u03b10 (t) + d1 \u03b1m\u22121 (t) ,\n***\n\n***\n\n(24)\n\n***\n\n\u03b1m\u22122 (t) + dm\u22121 \u03b1m\u22121 (t) ,\n\n(i)\n\nwith initial conditions \u03b1k (0) = \u03b4ik . It can be shown that functions \u03b1k (t) are\nmutually linearly independent, therefore for a given T there exists at least one\n\u2217\nset of time instants t1 , . . . , tm (m = deg \u03bc(\u03bb, L )) such that 0 \u2264 t1 < . . . < tm \u2264\nT and det [\u03b1k (tj )] 6= 0.\nTaking into account the above conditions one finds that the state \u03c1(0) can be\ndetermined uniquely (and the trajectory \u03a6(t)\u03c1(0) can be reconstructed) if and\n\u2217\nonly if operators of the form (L )k Qi for i = 1, . . . , n and k = 0, 1, . . . , m \u2212 1\nspan the space B(H).\nIf the dynamical semigroup is completely positive, then the general form of\nthe generator L is given by (16). In this case the criterion for reconstructibility\nof a d-level quantum system can be formulated using the operators H and Vj .\nIn particular, if we consider an isolated quantum system characterized by a\n4\n\n\fHamiltonian H0 and Vj = 0 for j = 1, . . . , \u03ba, then the minimal number of\nobservables Q1 , . . . , Q\u03b7 for which the system is (Q1 , . . . , Q\u03b7 )-reconstructible is\ngiven by\n\u03b7 = n21 + n22 + * * * + n2r ,\nwhere ni = dim Ker (\u03bb1 I \u2212 H0 ) for all \u03bbi \u2208 \u03c3(H0 ), i = 1, . . . , r (for details\ncf. [5]).\n\n3\n\nThe Minimal Number of Observables for Qudits Governed by Gaussian Semigroups\n\nLet us assume that the time evolution of a d-level quantum system S is described\nby the generator L given by\n\nL\u03c1 =\n\n\u0003\n1\b\n1\u0002\n[H\u03c1, H] + [H, \u03c1H] = \u2212 H, [H, \u03c1]\n2\n2\n\n(31)\n\nthat is, the semigroup \u03a6(t) has the form (cf. e.g. [11])\n1\n\u03a6(t)\u03c1 = \u221a\n2\u03c0t\n\nZ\u221e\n\n2\n\nds e\u2212s\n\n/(2t) \u2212iHs\n\ne\n\n\u03c1eiHs .\n\n(32)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThe symbol H in (31) and (32) denotes a self-adjoint operator with the spectrum\n\u03c3(H) = {\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbm } .\n\n(33)\n\nIn the sequel ni stands for the multiplicity of the eigenvalue \u03bbi for i = 1, . . . , m.\nOne can assume that the elements of the spectrum of H are numbered in such\na way that the inequalities \u03bb1 < \u03bb2 < . . . < \u03bbm are fulfilled. The following\ntheorem holds:\nTheorem 1 The index of cyclicity of the Gaussian semigroup with a generator\nL given by (31) is expressed by the formula\n\u03b7 = max{\u03ba, \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3r } ,\n\n(34)\n\nwhere r = (m \u2212 1)/2 if m is odd or r = (m \u2212 2)/2 if m is even, and\n\u03ba :=\n\u03b3k\n\n:=\n\nn21 + n22 + . . . + n2m ,\n2\n\nm\u2212k\nX\n\nni ni+k .\n\n(35)\n(36)\n\ni=1\n\nProof. In order to determine the value of \u03b7 for the generator L defined by (31)\nwe must find the number of nontrivial invariant factors of the operator L. Let\n\n5\n\n\fus observe that if \u03c3(H) = {\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbm } then the spectrum of the operator L is\ngiven by\nn\no\n\u03c3(L) = \u03bdij \u2208 R ; \u03bdij = (\u03bbi \u2212 \u03bbj )2 , i, j = 1, . . . , m .\n(37)\nThe above statement follows from the fact that the operator L can also be\nrepresented as\n(38)\nL = H 2 \u2297 1l + 1l \u2297 H 2 \u2212 2H \u2297 H ,\nwhere 1l denotes the identity in the space B(H). Since H is self-adjoint therefore\nthe algebraic multiplicity of \u03bbi , i.e. the multiplicity of \u03bbi as the root of the\ncharacteristic polynomial of H, is equal to the geometric multiplicity of \u03bbi ,\nni = dim Ker (\u03bbi 1l \u2212 H) . Of course, we have n1 + . . . + nm = dim H.\nFrom (38) we can see that the multiplicities of the eigenvalues of the operator\nL are not determined uniquely by the multiplicities of \u03bbi \u2208 \u03c3(H). But if we\nassume that \u03bb1 < . . . < \u03bbm and \u03bbk = (k \u2212 1)c + \u03bb1 , where k = 1, . . . , m, and\nc = const > 0, then the multiplicities of all eigenvalues of L are given by\n\nfor i 6= j and\n\n\u03b3|i\u2212j| = dim Ker [(\u03bbi \u2212 \u03bbj )2 1l \u2212 L]\n\n(39)\n\ndim Ker (L) = n21 + . . . + n2m = \u03ba\n\n(310)\n\nwhen i = j. Now, as we know, the minimal number of observables Q1 , . . . , Q\u03b7\nfor which the qudit S can be (Q1 , . . . , Q\u03b7 )-reconstructible is given by (18), so\nin our case\nn\no\ndim Ker [(\u03bbi \u2212 \u03bbj )2 1l \u2212 L] ,\n(311)\n\u03b7 =\nmax\ni,j=1,...,m\n\nwhere \u03bbi \u2208 \u03c3(H). Using the above formulae and the inequality \u03b3k < \u03ba for k > r,\nwhere r is given by (m \u2212 1)/2 if m is odd and (m \u2212 2)/2 if m is even, we can\nobserve that also without the assumption \u03bbk = (k \u2212 1)c + \u03bb1 one obtains\n\u03b7 = max{\u03ba, \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3r } .\n\n(312)\n\nThis completes the proof.\nAccording to Theorem 1 if the quantum system governed by a Gaussian semigroup is (Q1 , . . . , Qn )-reconstructible then the number n of observables must\nsatisfy the inequality n \u2265 \u03b7. In this case there exists a set of time instants\nt1 < t2 < . . . < tm (m = deg \u03bc(\u03bb, L)) such that the knowledge of the expectation values Ej (Qi ) = Tr (\u03c1(tj )Qi ) for i = 1, . . . , n and j = 1, . . . , m uniquely\ndetermines the trajectory of the system.\nThe natural question arises: what are the criteria governing the choice of\ntime instants t1 , . . . , tm ? The following theorem holds:\nTheorem 2 Let us assume that 0 \u2264 t1 < t2 < . . . < tm \u2264 T . Suppose that the\nmutual distribution of time instants t1 , . . . , tm is fixed, i.e. a set of nonnegative\n\n6\n\n\fnumbers c1 < . . . < cm is given and tj := cj t for j = 1, . . . , m, and t \u2208 R+ .\nThen for T > 0 the set\nn\nT o\n\u03c4 (T ) := (t1 , . . . , tm ) : tj = cj t, 0 \u2264 t \u2264\ncm\ncontains almost all sequences of time instants t1 , . . . , tm , i.e. all of them except\na finite number.\nProof. As one can check, the expectation values Etj (Qi ) and the operators\n\u2217\n(L )k Q1 i are related by the equality\nEtj (Qi ) =\n\nm\u22121\nX\nk=0\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u2217\n\u03b1k (cj t) (L )k Qi , \u03c10 ,\n\n(313)\n\nwhere we assume that tj = cj t and the bracket (*, *) denotes the Hilbert-Schmidt\nproduct in B(H). One can determine \u03c10 from (313) for all those values t \u2208 R+\nfor which the determinant \u03b1(t) is different from zero, i.e.\n\u03b1(t) := det [\u03b1k (cj t)] 6= 0 .\n\n(314)\n\nOne can prove that the range of the parameter t \u2208 R+ for which \u03b1(t) = 0\nconsists only of isolated points on the semiaxis R+ , i.e. does not possess any\naccumulation points on R+ . To this end let us note that since the functions\nt \u2192 \u03b1k (t) for k = 0, 1, . . . , m \u2212 1, are analytic on R, the determinant \u03b1(t)\ndefined by (314) is also an analytic function of t \u2208 R. If \u03b1(t) can be proved to\nbe nonvanishing identically on R, then, making use of its analyticity, we shall\nbe in position to conclude that the values of t, for which \u03b1(t) = 0, are isolated\npoints on the axis R.\nIt is easy to check that for k = m(m \u2212 1)/2\ndk \u03b1(t)\ndtk\n\nt=0\n\nY\n\n=\n\n1\u2264j<i\u2264m\n\n(ci \u2212 cj ) .\n\n(315)\n\nAccording to the assumption c1 < c2 < . . . < cm , we have \u03b1(k) (0) 6= 0 if\nk = m(m\u22121)/2. This means that the analytic function t \u2192 \u03b1(t) does not vanish\nidentically on R and the set of values of t for which \u03b1(t) = 0 cannot contain\naccumulation points. In other words, if we limit ourselves to an arbitrary finite\ninterval [0, T ], then \u03b1(t) can vanish only on a finite number of points belonging\nto [0, T ].
