Introduction\nClassical gauge theories are well described through differential geometry, where a gauge field\nis represented by a connection on a principal fibre bundle P for which the structure group is\nthe symmetry group of the theory; see, for example, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and references\ntherein.\nThe phenomenon of symmetry breaking also has its own geometric formulation [4, 5, 6,\n7, 8, 9, 10]: the reduction of the principal bundle P . To this classical picture, the question\nthat arises is that of how does a quantum field theory select its vacua given by the different\npossible reductions of the principal bundle P . The canonical answer to this question is that\nradiative corrections (beyond the tree-level approximation) cause the QFT to \"jump\" from\nthe symmetric phase to the broken-symmetric one(s) [13].\nHowever, [13] already expresses concerns about some issues (e.g., the last paragraph on\npage 1894 and its continuation on page 1895) that are more explicitly treated in [14]. For\nmore examples about these issues, see [15] (pages 27 and 28 discuss the asymptotic nature\nof the series expansion, their maximum accuracy and issues regarding Borel summation) and\n[21].\nLoosely speaking, what [14] does, is to compute the Schwinger-Dyson equations (for a\ngiven QFT) and note that these differential equations have as many solutions as its order\nindicates. Moreover, the boundary conditions that determine each of these solutions yield\ndifferent possible values for the parameters of the theory (mass, coupling constants, etc).\nThus, each one of these solutions has its own series expansion (which may or may not be\nequivalent to the perturbative series) and particular behavior.\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fThe analysis of the boundary conditions of the Schwinger-Dyson equation being responsible for the different solutions of the theory, done in [14], is more in the spirit of the self-adjoint\nextension of the associated Hamiltonian, as done in [22, 23]. Although it may not seem so\nat first, [14] is equivalent to a latticized approach to QFT and, as such, requires 2 types of\ninfinite limits in order to give rise to its continuum version: the thermodynamic (number of\nparticles in the box) and the volume (size of the box) limit. These limits do not commute\nand fiddling with them (as done in [14]) is analogous to resumming the perturbative series\n(as done in [13]).\nThe present work has the goal of developing a geometrical method that brings to the\nforeground these issues of vacuum structure in QFT, its multitude of solutions, i.e., its moduli\nspace and the relation between phase structure and the the topology of the moduli space\n(different solutions are topologically inequivalent). The fact that different configuration spaces\nfor distinct solutions of the equation of motion of a given Lagrangian have different topologies\nshows that expansions must be performed separately for each solution of a theory, i.e., each\nphase has to be regarded and treated as a separate theory.\nIn this sense, this work streamlines how the parameters of a theory (mass, coupling constants, etc) determine the topology of the vacuum manifold (moduli space) which, combined\nwith the picture presented in [14], gives a prescription of how to examine the solution space\nof a field theory: The boundary conditions of the Schwinger-Dyson equations determine the\nparameters of the theory which, in turn, determine its topology.\nIn the more modern language of Higgs Bundles (and their associated moduli spaces,\n[9]), what we are doing is to use an appropriate rescaling of the metric in such a way as to\nidentify its geodesics with the solutions of the [local] system in question. In this way, different\ngeodesics characterizes distinct elements of the moduli space, each one with its own topology,\nwhich is determined by the allowed ranges for the values of the parameters of the theory.\nThus, different phases of the theory are shown to have different topologies, which brings the\nsubject of topological transitions under a novel light, where they are represented by phase\ntransitions.\nThis work is a vast extension of what was done in [20], therefore we decided to start\nanew. The organization of this work is as follows: in section 2 we develop the basic tools\nand apply them to the classical case; in section 3 we move to quantum field theory and\nshow several of the properties that have been mentioned above, treating explicitly the \u03bb \u03c64\nexample; in section 4 we use this technique in gauge theories, revealing the extra structures\nthese theories have, using the Landau-Ginzburg and Seiberg-Witten models. We conclude\nwith some remarks about future work.\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\f2. Classical Field Theory and the Jacobi Metric\nA typical action for a scalar field has the form,\nZ\nS[\u03c6] = K(\u03c0, \u03c0) \u2212 V\u03c4 (\u03c6) dn x ;\nK(\u03c0, \u03c0) =\n\n1\n1\ng(\u03c0, \u03c0) = g\u03bc \u03bd \u03c0 \u03bc \u03c0 \u03bd .\n2\n2\n\nwhere K is the kinetic quadratic form (bilinear and, in case \u03c0 \u2208 C, hermitian; defining the\ninner product g) and V\u03c4 is the potential, where the index \u03c4 collectively denotes coupling\nconstants, mass terms, etc.\nWe want to reparameterize our field using the arc-length parameterization such that\ng\u0303(\u03c0\u0303, \u03c0\u0303) = g\u0303\u03bc \u03bd \u03c0\u0303 \u03bc \u03c0\u0303 \u03bd = 1, where g\u0303 is the new metric and \u03c0\u0303 \u03bc is the momentum field redefined in\nterms of this new parameterization (assuming V\u03c4 (\u03c6) contains no derivative couplings). That\nis, we want to scale our coordinate system in order to obtain a conformal transformation of\nthe metric that normalizes our momentum field.\nIn fact, there are three possible normalizations, depending on the nature of \u03c0\u0303:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nspacelike;\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f21,\ng\u0303(\u03c0\u0303, \u03c0\u0303) = 0,\nlightlike;\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\u22121, timelike.\nHowever, this will not concern us here, once our main focus will be to find the geodesics\nof g\u0303. Therefore, we have a clear distinction among the three foliations of Lorentzian spaces:\n\ng\u0303(\u03c0\u0303, \u03c0\u0303) > 0 represents the spacelike-leaf and contains only non-physical objects - after the\narc-length reparameterization we will have g\u0303(\u03c0\u0303, \u03c0\u0303) = 1;\ng\u0303(\u03c0\u0303, \u03c0\u0303) = 0 clearly singular, representing the null-leaf where there is no concept of distance,\ngiven that all objects here are massless;\ng\u0303(\u03c0\u0303, \u03c0\u0303) < 0 represents the timelike-leaf and contains the physical objects - after the arclength reparameterization we will have g\u0303(\u03c0\u0303, \u03c0\u0303) = \u22121.\nIn order to find the arc-length parameterization, we will borrow an idea from classical\nmechanics called Jacobi's metric [25]. In the Newtonian setting, Jacobi's metric gives an\nintrinsic geometry for the configuration space (resp. phase space), where dynamical orbits\nbecome geodesics, i.e., it maps every Hamiltonian flow into a geodesic one; therefore, solving\nthe equations of motion implies finding the geodesics of Jacobi's metric and vice-versa. This\ncan be done for any closed non-dissipative system (with total energy E), regardless of the\nnumber of degrees of freedom.\nBefore we proceed any further, let us take a look at a couple of simple examples in order\nto motivate our coming definition of Jacobi's metric.\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fHarmonic Oscillator Let us consider a model similar to the harmonic oscillator (in (1+0)dimensions): without further considerations, we simply allow for the analytic continuation\nof the frequency: \u03bc = +\u03c9 2 or \u03bc = \u2212\u03c9 2 . Its Lagrangian is given by L = 12 q\u0307 2 \u2213 \u03bc2 q 2 , where\n\u03bc > 0, from which we conclude that for a fixed E such that E = 21 (q\u0307 2 \u00b1 \u03bc q 2 ), we have\nq\n=\nq\u0307 = dq\n2 (E \u2213 \u03bc2 q 2 ) .\ndt\n\nSo, in the spirit of what was said above, we want to find a reparameterization of the time\ncoordinate in order to have the normalization q\u0307 = 1, where the dot represents a derivative\nwith respect to this new time variable.\nThus,\n\ns \u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bc 2\ndq ds\ndq\n=\n= 2 E\u2213 q\n;\ndt\nds dt\n2\ns \u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bc 2\nds\ndq\n= 2 E\u2213 q\n\u22611;\nif\n\u21d2\ndt\n2\nds\ns \u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bc 2\n\u2234 ds = 2 E \u2213 q\ndt ;\n2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03bc\n\u21d2 g\u0303 E = 2 E \u2213 q 2 g .\n2\nAs expected, the new metric, g\u0303 E , is a conformal transformation of the original one, g;\nand under this new metric, our original Lagrangian is simply written as,\n\n1 2 \u03bc 2\nq\u0307 \u2213 q ;\n2\n2\n1\n\u03bc\ni j\n= gi j q\u0307 q\u0307 \u2213 q 2 ;\n2\n2\n1\n\u03bc 2\n= g(q\u0307, q\u0307) \u2213 q ;\n2\n2\n\u2234 L(q, q\u0307) = g\u0303 E (q\u0307, q\u0307) .\nL(q, q\u0307) =\n\nNow, as we said above [25], the Euler-Lagrange equations for this conformally transformed\nLagrangian are simply the geodesics of the metric g\u0303 E . The task of finding the geodesics \u03b3(s)\nof the g\u0303 E metric can be more easily accomplished with the help of the normalization condition,\nd\u03b3 \u0001\ng\u0303 E d\u03b3\nds , ds = 1, and the initial condition \u03b3(s = 0) = 0, given that, in this fashion, we only\nneed to solve a first order differential equation:\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\f\u0012\n\n\u0013\nd\u03b3 d\u03b3\ng\u0303 E\n,\n=1;\nds ds\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nd\u03b3 d\u03b3\n\u03bc 2\n,\n=1;\n\u21d2 2 E\u2213 \u03b3 g\n2\nds ds\ns\n1\nd\u03b3\n\u0001 ;\n\u2234 \u03b3 \u2032 (s) =\n=\nds\n2 E \u2213 \u03bc2 \u03b3 2\n\nwith the initial condition:\n\n\u03b3(0) = 0 .\n\nHere we should note that solving for g\u0303 E (\u03b3 \u2032 , \u03b3 \u2032 ) = 1 (spacelike-leaf) is analogous to solving\ng\u0303 E (\u03b3 \u2032 , \u03b3 \u2032 ) = \u22121 (timelike-leaf), once the two cases are symmetrical about the origin.\n\nAnalytically solving the equation above yields 2 possible answers, depending on the particular form of the potential (\u03bc > 0 in both cases):\n\n1. V+ = +\u03bc \u03b3 2 /2: For the case of a positive pre-factor, we get that \u03b3\np\n\u0001\n\u221a\n2 E arcsin \u03b3 \u03bc/2E \u2212 2 s \u03bc = 0; and\n\np\n\n2.

The bottom-center plot superimposes both of them.\n\nThis \"harmonic oscillator\" model already portrays the features that we want to identify\nin forthcoming applications of this technique: changing the values of the parameters of the potential we can identify 2 distinct types of geodesics which will be related to different solutions\non the coming examples.\nNote, however, that in general the parameters will not be able to vary freely: they will\nbelong to some specified set; and they will be related to each other, i.e., we will be able to find\na function of the parameters that constrains their behavior - this will establish \"dualities\"\namong the parameters of a given theory, as will be shown below.\nCubic Potential For completeness sakes, let us try another example, that of a cubic potential given by: L = 21 g(q\u0307, q\u0307) + q 3 /3. It's Jacobi Metric is given by g\u0303 E = 2 (E + q 3 /3) g and\nthe equation we need to solve in order to find the geodesics, \u03b3(s), of this metric is,\n\ng\u0303 E (\u03b3 \u2032 , \u03b3 \u2032 ) = 2 (E + q 3 /3) g(\u03b3 \u2032 , \u03b3 \u2032 ) = 1 ;\n\u00012\n2 (E + q 3 /3) \u03b3 \u2032 (s) = 1 ;\nwith the initial condition:\n\n\u03b3(0) = 0 .\n\nOnce again, we should note that solving for g\u0303 E (\u03b3 \u2032 , \u03b3 \u2032 ) = \u22121 (timelike-leaf) is analogous\nto what is being done above: the graphs are reflected with respect to each other.\nThis example is slightly different from the previous one for the following reason: before,\nit was the relative values of E and \u03bc that determined our two solutions, i.e., one for E/\u03bc > 0\nand one for E/\u03bc < 0. Now, this cubic theory has no free parameters in its potential, therefore\nthe geodesics are labeled by the arbitrary parameter E.\nJust as before, the metric will be [artificially] degenerate when E = V (\u03b3), which tells us\nthat \u03b3 > (\u22123 E)1/3 : when E > 0 the geodesic is allowed to have any length, but when E < 0\nthe geodesic vanishes for some time, after which it starts to grow.\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fThis is very interesting because it essentially says that there is a \"lag time\" before this\nsolution comes alive: this leaf is non-existent for some \"proper time\" and then it springs into\nbeing quite abruptly.\nAiry Potential: E = +1; gE = (E + \u03b33/3) g\n\nAiry Potential: E = \u22121; gE = (E + \u03b33/3) g\n\n6\n\n25\n\n5\n20\n\n4\n\n\u03b3(s)\n\n\u03b3(s)\n\n15\n3\n\n10\n2\n\n5\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\ns\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\ns\n3\n\nAiry Potential: E = \u00b11; gE = (E + \u03b3 /3) g\n25\n\n20\n\n\u03b3(s)\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\ns\n\nFigure 2: The top-left-corner plot shows the geodesic for E = 1, while the top-right-corner one depicts it for\nE = \u22121. The bottom-center plot superimposes both of them.\n\nNow that we are done with our examples, we are ready to find the generalization of\nJacobi's metric to the field theoretical setting can be accomplished via the definition of the\nfollowing conformally transformed metric:\n1\ng(\u03c0, \u03c0) \u2212 V\u03c4 (\u03c6) ;\n2\n\u2261 g\u0303 \u03c4E (\u03c0\u0303, \u03c0\u0303) ;\n\nL=\n\nwhere,\n\u0001\ng\u0303\u03c4E = 2 E \u2212 V\u03c4 (\u03c6) g ;\n\nand E (an arbitrary parameter) is the total energy of the system.\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n(2.1)\n\n\f3. Applications in Quantum Field Theory\nWe will use the approach in terms of Feynman Path Integrals in order to make things more\nstraightforward. However, we could as well talk in terms of the phase space of a given QFT\nand its vacuum manifold, i.e., its moduli space.\nStarting from the partition function, we have the following (~ = 1):\n\nZ[J] = N\n=N\n\nw\n\nw\n\nei S[\u03c6]+i\nei\n\nR\n\nR\n\nJ(x) \u03c6(x) dd x\n\nD\u03c6 ;\n\ng\u0303 \u03c4E (\u03c0\u0303,\u03c0\u0303)+J(x) \u03c6(x) dd x\n\nD\u03c6 ;\n\nwhere N is a normalization constant such that Z[J = 0] = 1, and we have already written the\nAction in terms of Jacobi's metric.\nNow, let us expand the partition function above in terms of its classical part and its\nquantum fluctuations, i.e., \u03c6 = \u03c6cl + \u03b4\u03c6, and the classical Action is given by Scl = S[\u03c6cl ] =\nR \u03c4\nM g\u0303 E (\u03c0\u0303cl , \u03c0\u0303cl ), where M is the particular region of spacetime where the integration is performed and \u03c0 = d\u03c6 - for this calculation we are assuming the fluctuations vanish at the\nboundary, \u03b4\u03c6|\u2202M = 0. Thus, we have that,\nw\n\n\b\nexp i S[\u03c6cl + \u03b4\u03c6] D\u03c6 ;\n\u001b\n\u001a Z\nw\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\ng\u0303 E (\u03c0\u0303cl , \u03c0\u0303cl ) + g\u0303 E (\u03b4\u03c0\u0303, \u03b4\u03c0\u0303) D\u03c6 ;\n= exp i\n\nZ=\n\n(3.1)\n\nM\n\n= ei Scl F\u03c4 [\u2202M ] ;\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere,\nF\u03c4 [\u2202M ] =\n\nw\n\nei S[\u03b4\u03c6] D(\u03b4\u03c6) =\n\nw\n\nei\n\nR\n\nM\n\ng\u0303 \u03c4E (\u03b4\u03c0\u0303,\u03b4\u03c0\u0303)\n\nD(\u03b4\u03c6) \u2248 q\n\n1\ndet \u2212D\u03c42\n\n\u0001 ;\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere F\u03c4 [\u2202M ] is the [quantum] fluctuation part of the partition function, the index \u03c4 denoting\ncollectively the parameters of the potential (mass, coupling constants, etc), and D\u03c42 = \u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bc\nis the Laplace-Beltrami operator constructed from the covariant derivative (\u2207\u03bc ) associated\nto the Levi-Civita connection of g\u0303 \u03c4E . There are two important things to note from (3.3): the\nfluctuation term can only depend on the parameters of the potential and on the boundary\n\u2202M , i.e., surface terms (that we assumed vanishing); and its structure is analogous to that of\nthe classical part, in that g\u0303\u03c4E is the same on both.\nHowever, the above presumes that there is only one solution to the theory in question.\nBut, the method we are developing is exactly to use Jacobi's metric in order to find and\nclassify all of the solutions of the theory given, i.e., we want to be able to use this tool to\nstudy the moduli space of the problem at hand. Therefore, we need to generalize the situation\nabove for the case of many solutions, which is not a difficult task:\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fZ=\n\u2248\n\nN\nY\n\n\u03bd=1\nN\nY\n\n\u03bd=1\n\n\u03bd\n\nei Scl F\u03c4\u03bd [\u2202M ] ;\n\n(3.4)\n\n\u03bd\n\nei Scl\nq\n\ndet \u2212D\u03c42\n\n\u0001 ;\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere \u03bd counts the number of different solutions (i.e., the number of critical points of S[\u03c6],\n\u03bd = S[\u03c6\u03bd ]. Note that, in order to find all\nincluding its multiplicity) denoted by \u03c6\u03bdcl , and Scl\ncl\nof the possible critical points of S[\u03c6], we need to take into account its \u03c4 -dependence, and in\ndoing so we are implicitly assuming that \u03c4 \u2208 C, ensuring we are able to find them all.\nThere are two major observations to be done at this point:\n1. There are two kinds of discontinuities present in the above construction, [16]: first,\ncritical points \u03c6\u03bdcl can coalesce, which happens in the complexified catastrophe set in\n\u03bd can coalesce, which happens on\nparameter space; second, critical values I(i S[\u03c6\u03bdcl ]) = Scl\nthe Stokes set in parameter space and corresponds to the appearance or disappearance of\na subdominant exponential in a \"non-local bifurcation\". These correspond, respectively,\nto realizing that the partition function is to be taken over complex fields (rather than\nreal ones, as is customary), where the contour of integration (rendering the partition\nfunction finite, [14]) will ultimately determine the parameter space (these are the Lee\u03bd represents the Stokes phenomena\nYang zeros of our theory); and the coalescing of Scl\nof our theory. Both of these will determine the phase structure of our problem (see\n[14]). Note that it is the contour of integration that connects both of these, once the\nappropriately chosen range of \u03c6 will render ei S[\u03c6] convergent.\n2. The asymptotic behavior of the partition function depends only on the critical points\nof S, i.e., on \u03c6\u03bdcl . Thus, when S[\u03c6] (resp. V [\u03c6]) is a Morse function, i.e, smooth with no\ndegenerate critical points, we can use Morse's lemma to show that the critical points are\nisolated, keeping in mind that the number of isolated points is a topological invariant.\n(It is worth noting this can be generalized in the thermodynamical limit via the MorsePalais lemma, just as we can relax the condition of non-degeneracy of the critical points\nvia Morse-Bott theory.) Using this, it can be shown that \u03c6-space (resp. Phase Space)\nis a CW-complex with a \u03bd-cell for each critical point of index \u03bd: the fluctuation term\ncontains the Maslov-Morse index (in g\u0303\u03c4E by means of its dependence on V\u03c4 [\u03c6]) that\naccounts for the discretization of Path Space and corrects for the thermodynamic limit\nof the particular solution in question, i.e., every time the denominator in (3.5) vanishes,\nF\u03c4\u03bd [\u2202M ] passes a singularity in such a way as to ensure the proper phase; the phase factor\nthat arises in this way is nothing but ei \u03b1 \u03bd , where \u03b1 is some angle and \u03bd counts the\nnumber of zeros (with multiplicity) encountered along the particular path in question\n- it is called the Maslov-Morse index.\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fNow, we are ready to employ this machinery in order to draw several important conclusions. Here are them:\n1. The partition function, seen as a function of the parameters of the potential, Z = Z[\u03c4 ] =\nZ[mass, coupling constants], is a meromorphic function: it is holomorphic on a subset\nof C except for the set of isolated points given by the values of the parameters along\nStokes' lines (resp. critical lines of phase transition). We have to keep in mind that the\nparameter space had to be complexified in order to yield all possible solutions to the\ntheory given; another way to think about this is in terms of the contours that render\nthe partition function finite: changing these contours (looking for all possible ones that\nmake the partition function converge) will affect the allowed values for the parameters,\ni.e., these contours ultimately determine the parameter space, as done in [14] (see also\n[19]).\n\u0001\n\b\n2. Under the [full] elliptic modular group, \u0393 = SL(2, Z) = ac db | a = 1, b = 0, c = 0, d =\n1 (see [17]), the partition function is a modular function, i.e., for any M \u2208 \u0393 we have\n+b\n. (For a fuller appreciation of the importance of\nthat Z[M \u03c4 ] = Z[\u03c4 ], where M \u03c4 = ac \u03c4\u03c4+d\nthis fact, see, e.g., [18].)\nR\n3. The Action, written in terms of Jacobi's metric, S[\u03c6] = M g\u0303 E (\u03c0\u0303, \u03c0\u0303), can be thought\nR\nof as the Morse-theoretic Energy functional, E[\u03b3] = g(\u03b3 \u2032 , \u03b3 \u2032 ), for the path \u03b3, where\n\u03b3 \u2032 = d\u03b3/ds. Therefore, we can readily say that all of the critical points of S[\u03c6] are given\nby minimal [Lagrangian] manifolds, and, just like E \u2032\u2032 , S \u2032\u2032 = \u03b42 S/\u03b4\u03c6(x)\u03b4\u03c6(y) is a well\ndefined symmetric bilinear functional. This implies that S \u2032\u2032 = 0 if, and only if, \u03c0\u0303 is a\nJacobi field, which, in turn, implies that \u03c0\u0303|\u2202M = 0. Therefore, using the split of the\npartition function (3.4) in terms of a classical part and its quantum fluctuations, we see\nthat the vacuum manifold (moduli space) of the quantum theory is given by its classical\nminimal Lagrangian manifold with the quantum corrections being given by extensions\nof it via Jacobi fields. That is, the classical minimal manifold is extended via the gluing\nof the quantum fluctuation manifold obtained as a solution to the equations of motion\nR\ncoming from Sfl = M g\u0303 \u03c4E (\u03b4\u03c0\u0303, \u03b4\u03c0\u0303). Thus, the quantum corrections are handles attached\nto the classical solution, without changing the classical topology.\n4. Continuing the reasoning above, it is not difficult to see that a phase transition will\nhappen when the quantum corrections (in terms of handle attachments) actually do\nchange the topology of the particular solution in question. In fact, if V\u03c4 [\u03c6] crosses a\ncritical point of index \u03bd, the handle to be attached is a \u03bd-cell (i.e., a \u03bd-simplex) -\nthe connection with what has been said before should be straightforward. Analogously,\n\u22121\nE\nwe can say the following: let \u03a3E\n\u03c4 = V\u03c4 [E] = {\u03c6 | V\u03c4 [\u03c6] = E}, i.e., \u03a3\u03c4 is the set of\nall field configurations which have the same potential energy - this manifold is the\nconfiguration space (resp. moduli space), an equipotential surface. Thus, the family of\nequipotentials {\u03a3E\n\u03c4 }E\u2208R foliates the configuration space (moduli space) in such a way\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\f\u221e\n\u0112\nthat if \u03a3E\n\u03c4 is C -diffeomorphic to \u03a3\u03c4 (for two different values of the energy, E and \u0112)\nthen there is no phase transition. Conversely, a phase transition will be characterized by\n\u221e\nthe existence of a certain critical value Ec such that {\u03a3E\n\u03c4 }E<Ec is not C -diffeomorphic\n\u0112\nto {\u03a3\u03c4\u0304 }\u0112>Ec (note that, upon a phase transition, the parameters of the potential change\nfrom \u03c4 to \u03c4\u0304 ). Further, the topological difference between these two leaves is a \u03bd-cell,\nwhere \u03bd is the index of the critical point Ec . Loosely speaking, it can be said that the\norigin of phase transitions is this change in topology. Therefore, different phases of the\ntheory are topologically inequivalent.\n\n5. Finally, let us note that all of these conclusions we have drawn so far have one last\nimplication, a topological constraint: the Euler Characteristic, \u03c7, computed from g\u0303 E\ngives the quantization rules [for the energy]. Therefore, our theory can be topologically\nE\nquantized; in fact, each topologically inequivalent leaf {\u03a3E\n\u03c4 } has its own \u03c7\u03c4 and, thus,\nits own quantization rules.\nWith all of these facts in hand, let us see what is the framework they imply: given a\ntheory, L = g(\u03c0, \u03c0) + V\u03c4 [\u03c6], we can readily construct its Jacobi metric, g\u0303\u03c4E = 2 (E \u2212 V\u03c4 ) g:\nfrom this, we can do two things, either compute the geodesics of g\u0303\u03c4E and classify their Jacobi\nfields in terms of \u03c4 , or calculate its Euler Characteristics, \u03c7E\n\u03c4 , and find the quantization\nrules (bearing in mind that they will vary with \u03c4 ). The different geodesics (corresponding\nto different Jacobi fields) will label diffeomorphically equivalent foliations {\u03a3E\n\u03c4 }, while the\n\u03bd\norder of the zeros of F\u03c4 [\u2202M ] will correspond to the \u03bd-cells associated with a particular phase\ntransition - furthermore, they will be responsible for the Lee-Yang zeros and the Stokes\nphenomena of the theory. In turn, this gives the partition function a meromorphic and a\nmodular character when seen with respect to \u03c4 .\nAll of this was possible because we extended the parameter space, allowing \u03c4 to be\ncomplex. This is completely analogous to complexifying the solution space (moduli space) of\nthe theory given, a fact which is made clear in [14] (and employed in lattice calculations in\n[19]).\nLastly, using \u03c4 , it will be possible to construct \"dualities\" between different phases. However, in general, these dualities will be non-trivial combinations of the parameters of the\ntheory (as opposed to what we found in the simple examples above, where E/\u03bc 7\u2192 \u2212E/\u03bc or\nE 7\u2192 \u2212E did the job).\n3.1 The \u03bb \u03c64 Potential\nThis theory is defined for scalar-valued fields, \u03c6, by the Lagrangian L = 12 g(\u03c0, \u03c0) \u2212 \u03bc \u03c62 \u2212\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1\n\u03bb 4\n2 \u03bb 4\n2 \u03c6 , i.e., the potential is given by V (\u03c6) = 2 \u03bc \u03c6 + 2 \u03c6 ; which is invariant by Z2 -reflection:\n\u03c6 7\u2192 \u2212\u03c6.\n\u0001\nThe Jacobi metric for this theory is given by g\u0303 \u03c4E = 2 E \u2212 \u03bc2 \u03c62 \u2212 \u03bb4 \u03c64 g.

Therefore,\nit is useful to consider the polynomialp\nP (\u03b3) = (\u03b3 2 \u2212 r1 ) (\u03b3 2 \u2212 r2 ), where (\u2212\u03bb/4) P (\u03b3) =\n\u0001\n2\n4\nE \u2212 \u03bc \u03b3 /2 \u2212 \u03bb \u03b3 /4 and r1,2 = \u2212 \u03bc \u00b1 4 E \u03bb + \u03bc2 /\u03bb. It is the discriminant of this polynomial P (\u03b3) that will, ultimately, determine the different solutions of the theory: \u2206 =\n(r1 \u2212 r2 )2 = \u03bb E + \u03bc2 /4 \u22da 0.\nAs mentioned above, the \"dualities\" between different phases involves non-trivial combinations of the parameters of the theory. In this case, the dualities are given by the possible\nvalues of the discriminant above: \u2206 > 0, \u2206 = 0 or \u2206 < 0.\nThe two inequalities, \u2206 > 0 and \u2206 < 0, are related by the reflection of the \u03c4 parameter\nof this theory, where \u03c4 = \u03bc2 /\u03bb, i.e., by the analytic continuation of the mass parameter such\nthat \u03bc2 7\u2192 \u2212\u03bc2 , which implies that \u03c4 7\u2192 \u2212\u03c4 - note that this can be obtained by a modular\n+b\ntransformation, M \u03c4 = ca \u03c4\u03c4+d\n= \u2212\u03c4 , such that b = 0 = c, d = 1 and a = \u22121; further, the\nanalytic continuation of \u03bc is such that \u03bc 7\u2192 \u00b1i \u03bc, or more generically as \u03bc 7\u2192 e\u00b1i \u03c0 \u03bd/2 \u03bc, for\nodd \u03bd (this is related to the Stokes phenomena discussed previously, where \u03bd selects a certain\nRiemann sheet for this analytic continuation, which depends on the Maslov-Morse index \u03bd)\n-; meanwhile, the case \u2206 = 0 has to be computed separately, once it establishes a fixed value\n\u03c4 = \u22124 E - note that when \u2206 = 0 the resultant of P (\u03b3) and its derivative, P \u2032 (\u03b3), also\nvanishes, this resultant being given by Res(P, P \u2032 ) = \u2212 \u03bb4 \u2206, which says that P and P \u2032 have a\n2\ncommon root (which happens when \u03c4 = \u03bc\u03bb = \u22124 E).\nThis whole framework is potentially a very interesting result, once discriminants are\nclosely related and contain information about ramifications (\"branching out\" or \"branches\ncoming together\") in Number Theory. As we just saw, these ramifications are related to\nthe topological structure of each solution, where the Maslov-Morse index, \u03bd, selects the appropriate Riemann sheet (for the analytic continuation) and the topology of the problem\n(determined by the attachment of a \u03bd-cell). Therefore, this duality relating the two different\nsolutions, for \u03c4 and \u2212\u03c4 , is given by a [particular] modular transformation of \u03c4 (resp. analytic\ncontinuation of \u03bc), which turns out to be a measure of the ramifications of the problem.\nThe analytical answers for the geodesic \u03b3(s) are found to be given by the following implicit\nequations:\n\u2206 = 0 , Res(P, P \u2032 ) = 0 :\n1 3 \u03bc\n\u03b3 + \u03b3+s=0;\n3\n\u03bb\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n(3.7)\n\n\f\u2206 > 0 , Res(P, P \u2032 ) < 0 :\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221a\n\u03b3 q\n(\u03b3 2 \u2212 r1 ) (\u03b3 2 \u2212 r2 ) + 2 r1 r2 F \u221a ; rr12 \u2212\nr1\n\" \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013#\n\u03b3 q r1\n\u03b3 q r1\n2 \u03bc\u221a\nr2 F \u221a ; r 2 \u2212 E \u221a ; r 2\n=0;\n\u2212\n3\u03bb\nr1\nr1\n\n3s + \u03b3\n\np\n\n(3.8)\n\n\u2206 < 0 , Res(P, P \u2032 ) > 0 :\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221a\n\u03b3 q r1\n\u2212 r1\n\u2212 r2 ) + 2 r1 r2 F \u221a ; r2 \u2212\n3s + \u03b3\nr1\n\" \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013#\n\u03b3 q r1\n\u03b3 q r1\n2 \u03bc\u221a\n=0.\n\u2212\nr2 F \u221a ; r 2 \u2212 E \u221a ; r 2\n3\u03bb\nr1\nr1\np\n\n(\u03b3 2\n\n) (\u03b3 2\n\n(3.9)\n\nNote that, in the equations above, F (z; k) is the incomplete elliptic integral of the first\nkind, while E(z; k) is the incomplete elliptic integral of the second kind.

On top of this, although (3.8) and (3.9) have the same form, they\nwill yield distinct solutions, once the relation given by \u2206 = \u03bb E + \u03bc2 /4 will either be positive\nor negative, which, in turn, affects the outcome of r1,2 - as already discussed above for\n\u03c4 7\u2192 \u2212\u03c4 .\nThe graphical results are shown below, where E\u03bb = 1, \u03b3(0) = 0 and \u2206, respectively,\nassumes positive (\u2206 > 0), null (\u2206 = 0) and negative (\u2206 < 0) values:\n\u03bb \u03c64: E/\u03bb = 1; gE = (E + \u03bc \u03b32 + \u03bb \u03b34/2) g\n\n\u03bb \u03c64: E/\u03bb = 1; gE = (E + \u03bc \u03b32 + \u03bb \u03b34/2) g\n\n3.5\n\n1.6\n\n1.4\n\n3\n\n1.2\n2.5\n1\n\u03b3(s)\n\n\u03b3(s)\n\n2\n0.8\n\n1.5\n0.6\n1\n0.4\n0.5\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\ns\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\ns\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n\u03bb \u03c64: E/\u03bb = 1; gE = (E + \u03bc \u03b32 + \u03bb \u03b34/2) g\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n\u03b3(s)\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\ns\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\nFigure 3: The top-left-corner plot shows the geodesic for E/\u03bb = 1 and \u2206 > 0, while the top-right-corner one\ndepicts it for E/\u03bb = 1 and \u2206 = 0.

Then, when \u2206 vanishes (middle graph), there is a clear\nchange which delimits the 2 different phases of the theory. Moreover, when \u2206 is negative\n(rightmost graph), we have the third [broken-symmetric] phase of the theory (which has a\nfinite geodesic).\n\n4. Gauge Theory Examples\nNow, we will consider examples of theories with gauge symmetry (rather than the discrete Z2 symmetry of above). As seen in (3.6), taking \u03b3 7\u2192 \u2212\u03b3 did not change the geodesic structure,\ni.e., the procedure was covariant (resp. equivariant). This should come as no surprise, once\nthe potential, V\u03c4 (\u03c6), is an equivariant function of the fields and the spacetime (base manifold)\nmetric does not depend on the gauge symmetry involved either.\nAs mentioned before in section 3, we have assumed thus far that the quantum fluctuations\nvanish at the boundary, \u03b4\u03c6|\u2202M = 0. This, in turn, implies that the Jacobi fields \u03c0\u0303 will satisfy\n\u03c0\u0303|\u2202M = 0. While the fields considered have no internal structure (i.e., gauge symmetry), this\nis a fairly straightforward constraint, in the sense that its solution is trivial (albeit labeled by\n\u03c4 ). However, when gauge symmetry is present, there may be non-trivial solutions to these\nconstraints. This is the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking.\nTherefore, following the discussion done in section 3, the following may happen: the\nquantum corrections, which are handles attached to the classical solution, may now be able\nto change the topology of the classical solution. So, when a symmetry is reduced from G \u2192 H\n(where H is a subgroup of G; see, e.g., [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10]), we start with a Jacobi field which\nsatisfies \u03c0\u0303G |\u2202M = 0 and end up with a Jacobi field who only has H as symmetry, which implies\nthat \u03c0\u0303H |\u2202M = 0 - this means that the initial degrees-of-freedom that combined (respecting\nthe G symmetry) to yield the [initial] constraint \u03c0\u0303G |\u2202M = 0, are not all available now, such\nthat only part of the original symmetry is still respected, yielding \u03c0\u0303H |\u2202M = 0 (the remaining\ndegrees-of-freedom having recombined in non-trivial ways); thus, we end up with a source (or\nsink) of Jacobi fields that only have H as symmetry.\nIn this sense, the Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem can be used to measure this variation\n(i.e., to measure the inequivalent representations of the algebra of observables):\n1. If all of the quantum corrections preserve the topology of the classical solution, the\ntopological index does not change, which implies that the analytical index of the differential operator in question also does not change, which, in turn, leaves the vacuum\nstate unchanged.\n2. On the other hand, if the quantum fluctuations change the topology of the classical solution (as described above), the topological index will change (following the attachment\nof the appropriate \u03bd-cell), implying that the analytical index changes as well, which\nmeans that the vacuum state changes.\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\fFrom a different viewpoint, the question can be posed in the following way: Given a\ncertain symmetry breaking connection, how can the topology of the moduli space of the\nassociated Higgs Bundle be studied?\nThere are some studies in this direction, but no general answers: this is because these\ntypes of characterizations are highly model-dependent, i.e., they depend on the particular\nproperties of the connection chosen for the Higgs Bundle in question. For instance, following\nthe discussion above, if the boundary \u2202M is non-existent (i.e., M is compact), then \u03c0\u0303|\u2202M = 0\nis trivialy satisfied; however, if M has, e.g., punctures (i.e., a finite set of points omitted),\nthen the connection in question will have a certain ramification structure and the constraint\n\u03c0\u0303|\u2202M = 0 will have non-trivial solutions (see, e.g., [31], and references therein); therefore, the\nboundary conditions (in the sense of [14, 19]) on the Jacobi fields ultimately determine the\nstructure of the connection (i.e., gauge field).\nThe examples below are twofold: the first one (Landau-Ginzburg Functional, subsection\n4.1) serves the purpose of showing the equivariance of the method discussed in this work,\nonce the connection (which is u(1)-valued) does not undergo symmetry breaking; while the\nsecond one (Seiberg-Witten Functional, subsection 4.2) can be understood as defined for pairs\n(A, \u03c6), where A is a Hermitian connection (compatible with the holomorphic estructure on\nthe bundle in question) and \u03c6 is a section (of the bundle at hand) - in this sense, one can\nconsider the space of solutions to Hitchin's equations (i.e., the moduli space of the associated\nHiggs Bundle) given by,\n\nFA + [\u03c6, \u03c6\u2217 ] = 0 ;\nd\u2032\u2032A \u03c6\n\n(4.1)\n(4.2)\n\n=0;\n\nwhere FA is the curvature of A and d\u2032\u2032A \u03c6 is the anti-holomorphic part of the covariant derivative\nof \u03c6 (compare these with equations (4.11) and (4.12)). In this sense, the different solutions\nfound via (4.13) are a direct statement about the topology of the moduli space of the Higgs\nBundle under study.\n4.1 The Landau-Ginzburg Functional\nTo start off, let us consider the case where the base manifold is a compact Riemann surface\n\u03a3 equipped with a conformal metric and the vector bundle is a Hermitian line bundle L (i.e.,\nwith fiber C and a Hermitian metric h*, *i on the fibers).\nThe Landau-Ginzburg functional is defined for a section \u03c6 and a unitary connection\nDA = d +A of L as (\u03c3 \u2208 R is a real scalar),\nL(\u03c6, A) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03a3\n\n|FA |2 + |DA \u03c6|2 +\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n\u00012\n1\n\u03c3 \u2212 |\u03c6|2 .\n4\n\n\fThus, its Euler-Lagrange equations [of motion] are given by:\n\u0001\n1\n\u03c3 \u2212 |\u03c6|2 \u03c6 ;\n2\n\u2217\nDA\nFA = \u2212 RehDA \u03c6, \u03c6i ;\n\n\u2217\nDA\nDA \u03c6 =\n\n\u2217 is the dual of D , i.e., D \u2217 = \u2212 \u2217 D \u2217 = \u2212 \u2217 (d +A) \u2217. Note that the equation for\nwhere, DA\nA\nA\nA\nFA (the second one above) is linear in A. Since DA is a unitary connection, A is a u(1)-valued\n1-form. This Lie algebra (of the group U (1)) will sometimes be identified with i R - in other\nwords, our A corresponds to \u2212i A in the standard physics literature (where A is real-valued).\nBefore we go any further, some notational remarks are in order. We decompose the\nspace of 1-forms, \u03a91 , on \u03a3 as \u03a91 = \u03a91,0 \u2295 \u03a90,1 , with \u03a91,0 spanned by 1-forms of the type\ndz and \u03a90,1 by 1-forms of the type dz\u0304. Here z = x + i y is a local conformal parameter\non \u03a3 and z\u0304 = x \u2212 i y. Therefore, dz = dx + i dy, dz\u0304 = dx \u2212 i dy, \u2202z = 12 (\u2202x \u2212 i \u2202y ) and\n\u2202z\u0304 = 21 (\u2202x + i \u2202y ). Furthermore, if \u2202x and \u2202y are an orthonormal basis of the tangent space\nof \u03a3 at a given point, we have that hdz, dzi = 2, hdz\u0304, dz\u0304i = 2 and hdz, dz\u0304i = 0. Given that\nthe decomposition \u03a91 = \u03a91,0 \u2295 \u03a90,1 is orthogonal, we may also decompose DA accordingly:\nDA = \u2202A + \u2202 \u0304A , where \u2202A \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a91,0 (L) and \u2202 \u0304A \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a90,1 (L) for all sections \u03c6 of L (holomorphic,\n\u2202 \u0304A f (z, z\u0304) = 0 \u21d4 f (z, z\u0304) = f (z), and anti-holomorphic, \u2202A f (z, z\u0304) = 0 \u21d4 f (z, z\u0304) = f (z\u0304), parts;\ni.e., the space of 1-forms and the space of connections is decomposable into a direct sum of\nits holomorphic and anti-holomorphic parts: \u2202A = \u2202 + A1,0 and \u2202 \u0304A = \u2202 \u0304 + A0,1 ; while the\n \u0304 As expected, we have that \u2202A \u2202A = 0 = \u2202 \u0304A \u2202 \u0304A and\nexterior derivative is given by d = \u2202 + \u2202).\n\u0001\n \u0304\n \u0304\nFA = \u2212 \u2202A \u2202A + \u2202A \u2202A .\nIt is not difficult to show [29] that:\n\n\u00012\n1\n|FA |2 + |DA \u03c6|2 +\n\u03c3 \u2212 |\u03c6|2 ;\n4\n\u03a3\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0001\u00112\n1\n2\n\u03c3 \u2212 |\u03c6|2\n;\n2 \u2202 \u0304A \u03c6 + \u2217(\u2212i FA ) \u2212\n= 2 \u03c0 deg(L) +\n2\n\u03a3\ni\ndeg(L) = c1 (L) =\ntr(FA ) ;\n2\u03c0\n\nL(\u03c6, A) =\n\nwhere\n\nZ\n\ni.e., the degree of the line bundle is given by the 1st Chern class.\nTherefore, a very useful consequence from the above is that if deg(L) > 0 the lowest\npossible value for L(\u03c6, A) is realized if \u03c6 and A satisfy\n\u2202 \u0304A \u03c6 = 0 ;\n\u0001\n1\n\u03c3 \u2212 |\u03c6|2 .\n\u2217(i FA ) =\n2\n\n(4.3)\n(4.4)\n\nThese equations are just the expression of the self-duality of the Landau-Ginzburg functional. If deg(L) < 0, then these equations cannot have any solution, thus one has to consider the self-duality equations arising from the Landau-Ginzburg functional where the term\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\f+2 \u03c0 deg(L) is substituted by \u22122 \u03c0 deg(L). Therefore, without loss of generality, we shall\nassume deg(L) > 0. A necessary condition for the solvability of (4.4) is that,\n2 \u03c0 deg(L) =\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\u0001 \u03c3\n1\n\u03c3 \u2212 |\u03c6|2 6 Area(\u03a3) ;\ni FA =\n2 \u03a3\n2\n4 \u03c0 deg(L)\n\u2234 \u03c3>\n;\nArea(\u03a3)\n\n(4.5)\n\nand the equality only occurs if, and only if, \u03c6 \u2261 0.\nThe following result is useful when studying the solutions of the above functionals [29]:\nLet \u03a3 be a compact Riemann surface with a conformal metric and L as before. For any\nsolution of (4.3), we have that |\u03c6| 6 \u03c3 on \u03a3. That is, this maximum principle states that\nthe amplitude of the field cannot exceed the height of the potential (see the first plot below).\nLet us now construct the Jacobi metric for this potential and find its possible geodesics:\n\u0001\ng\u0303 E = 2 E \u2212 V\u03c3 (\u03b3) g ;\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0001\n1\n2 2\n=2 E+\n\u03c3 \u2212 |\u03b3|\ng.\n4\n\nIn a complete analogy to what was previously done, we consider the P (\u03b3) = E \u2212 V (\u03b3)\npolynomial. However, in order to make this analysis clearer, let us, in fact, use a slightly\n\u0001\ndifferent polynomial given by P \u2032 (\u03b3) = 4 P (\u03b3) \u2212 E . It is straightforward to see that P \u2032 (\u03b3) =\n\u0001\n\u0001\n|\u03b3|2 \u2212 \u03c3 |\u03b3|2 \u2212 \u03c3 , which means that \u03c3 is the only root of P \u2032 (\u03b3), with double multiplicity\n(the two roots coalesce into one).\nThis situation implies that the discriminant of P \u2032 (\u03b3) vanishes, i.e., \u2206 = 0, and the\ndifferent phases of the theory are labelled by \u03c3 = 0 and \u03c3 > 0.\nThe plots below have, respectively, the following values for \u03c3: 0.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0, 11.0 and\n31.0.

In this sense, Hitchin's self-duality\nequations become,\n\u2202 \u0304A \u03c6 = 0 ;\n\n(4.6)\n\nFA + [\u03c6, \u03c6\u2217 ] = 0 .\n\n(4.7)\n\nCompare these with (4.3) and (4.4).\nIn this sense, the solutions found above are a direct statement about the topology of the\nHiggs Bundle in question.\n4.2 The Seiberg-Witten Functional\nIn this case, the base manifold, M , is a compact, oriented, 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold\nendowed with a spinc structure, i.e., a spinc manifold. The determinant line of this spinc\nstructure will be denoted by L and the Dirac operator determined by a unitary connection A\non L will be denoted by DA . Recalling the half spin bundle S\u00b1 defined by the spinc structure,\nwe see that DA maps sections of S\u00b1 into sections of S\u2213 [26, 27, 28, 29].\nIn this fashion the Seiberg-Witten functional for a unitary connection A on L and a\nsection \u03c6 of S+ is given by,\nZ\n1\nR\n(4.8)\n|\u2207A \u03c6|2 + |FA+ |2 + |\u03c6|2 + |\u03c6|4 ;\nSW [\u03c6, A] =\n4\n8\nM\nwhere \u2207A is the spinc connection induced by A and the Levi-Civita connection of M , FA+ is\nthe self-dual part of the curvature of A and R is the scalar curvature of M . Its Euler-Lagrange\nequations are given by,\n\n\u2207\u2217A \u2207A \u03c6\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\nR 1 2\n=\u2212\n+ |\u03c6| \u03c6 ;\n4\n4\n\n(4.9)\n\nd\u2217 FA+ = \u2212 Reh\u2207A \u03c6, \u03c6i .\n\n(4.10)\n\nUsing a spin frame, it is not difficult [29] to show that the Seiberg-Witten functional can\nbe written in the following form:\nSW [\u03c6, A] =\n\nZ\n\nM\n\n|DA \u03c6|2 + FA+ \u2212\n\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n1\nhej * ek * \u03c6, \u03c6i ej \u2227 ek\n4\n\n2\n\n;\n\n\fwhere ej are 1-forms dual to the tangent vectors ej , ej (ek ) = \u03b4kj ; j, k = 1, . . . , 4. As a corollary\nof the above, the lowest possible value of the Seiberg-Witten functional is achieved if \u03c6 and\nA are solutions of the Seiberg-Witten equations:\n(4.11)\n\nDA \u03c6 = 0 ;\n1\nFA+ = hej * ek * \u03c6, \u03c6i ej \u2227 ek .\n4\n\n(4.12)\n\nThus, self-duality is at work yet again: the absolute minima of the Seiberg-Witten functional satisfy not only the second order equations (4.9) and (4.10), but also the first order\nSeiberg-Witten equations (4.11) and (4.12).\nAlthough our discussion of the Seiberg-Witten functional, so far, has mirrored our discussion of the Landau-Ginzburg one, the parameter \u03c3 on the latter has had no analogue in the\nformer. This can be accomplished with the introduction of a 2-form \u03bc and the consideration\nof the perturbed functional,\n\nSW\u03bc [\u03c6, A] =\n\nZ\n\nM\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nM\n\n|DA \u03c6|2 + FA+ \u2212\n\n1\nhej * ek * \u03c6, \u03c6i ej \u2227 ek + \u03bc\n4\n\n|\u2207A \u03c6|2 + |FA+ |2 +\n\n2\n\n;\n\n1\nR 2\n|\u03c6| + \u03bc \u2212 hej * ek * \u03c6, \u03c6i ej \u2227 ek\n4\n4\n\n2\n\n+ 2 hFA+ , \u03bci .\n\nTheir corresponding first order equations of motion are,\n\nDA \u03c6 = 0\n1\nFA+ = hej * ek * \u03c6, \u03c6i ej \u2227 ek \u2212 \u03bc .\n4\nIf we assume that \u03bc is closed and self-dual, then we see that hFA , \u03bci = hFA+ , \u03bci, once\n= 0 due to the orthogonality between anti-self-dual and self-dual forms. Thus, given\nthat FA represents the first Chern class c1 (L) of the line bundle L, and we assumed \u03bc to be\nclosed (hence it represents a cohomology class [\u03bc]), the integral\nZ\nhFA , \u03bci ,\nhFA\u2212 , \u03bci\n\nM\n\ndoes not depend on the connection A, thus representing a topological invariant, denoted by\n\u0001\nc1 (L) \u2227 [\u03bc] [M ].\nJust as before, we also have a maximum principle: For any solution \u03c6 of (4.9) - in\nparticular, for any solution of (4.11) - on a compact 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold,\nwe have that,\nmax |\u03c6|2 6 max(\u2212R(x), 0) .\nM\n\nx\u2208M\n\n\u2013 19 \u2013\n\n\fAs a direct consequence of this, if the compact, oriented, Riemannian Spinc manifold M\nhas nonnegative scalar curvature, the only possible solution of the Seiberg-Witten equations\nis,\n\u03c6\u22610;\n\nFA+ \u2261 0 .\n\nThe Jacobi metric for this Seiberg-Witten model is given by\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\nR 2 1 4\ng\u0303 E = 2 E + |\u03b3| + |\u03b3| g ;\n4\n8\n\n(4.13)\n\nfor a geodesic \u03b3; and, just like before, although P (\u03b3) = E \u2212 V (\u03b3) = E + R |\u03b3|2 /4 + |\u03b3|4 /8,\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nlet us consider P \u2032 (\u03b3) = 8 P (\u03b3) \u2212 E = |\u03b3|2 \u2212 0 |\u03b3|2 + 2 R . It is then clear that when\nR = 0 the discriminant vanishes (\u2206 = 0) and the 2 roots merge into 1, what constitutes one\nof the phases of the theory. When R 6= 0, the discriminant is either \u2206 > 0 (R > 0) or \u2206 < 0\n(R < 0), which accounts for the other 2 phases of the theory.\nThe plots below were obtained with the choice of E = 1.0 and R respectively equal to\n0.0, 3.0, 7.0, \u22123.0, \u22125.0, \u22127.0.\n2\n\n4\n\n2\n\nSeiberg\u2212Witten: E = 1.0, R = 0.0; gE = 2 (E + 1\u20444 R |\u03b3| + |\u03b3| /8) g\n\n4\n\n2\n\nSeiberg\u2212Witten: E = 1.0, R = 3.0; gE = 2 (E + 1\u20444 R |\u03b3| + |\u03b3| /8) g\n\n4\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\nSeiberg\u2212Witten: E = 1.0, R = 7.0; gE = 2 (E + 1\u20444 R |\u03b3| + |\u03b3| /8) g\n\n3.5\n\n3.5\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2.5\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n2.5\n\u03b3(s)\n\n2\n\n\u03b3(s)\n\n\u03b3(s)\n\n2\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n1\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\ns\n\n8\n\n10\n\n2\n\n12\n\n0\n0\n\n4\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\ns\n\n8\n\n10\n\n2\n\nSeiberg\u2212Witten: E = 1.0, R = \u22123.0; gE = 2 (E + 1\u20444 R |\u03b3| + |\u03b3| /8) g\n\n12\n\n0\n\n4\n\n1.6\n\n4\n\n6\ns\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n4\n\nSeiberg\u2212Witten: E = 1.0, R = \u22127.0; gE = 2 (E + 1\u20444 R |\u03b3| + |\u03b3| /8) g\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1.4\n\n2\n\n2\n\nSeiberg\u2212Witten: E = 1.0, R = \u22125.0; gE = 2 (E + 1\u20444 R |\u03b3| + |\u03b3| /8) g\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n1.2\n\n0.6\n0.7\n0.5\n\n0.8\n\n\u03b3(s)\n\n0.6\n\u03b3(s)\n\n\u03b3(s)\n\n1\n\n0.5\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n0.4\n\n0.2\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\ns\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\ns\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\ns\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nFigure 5: The plot in the upper left corner depicts the solution for R = 0, while the plots in the upper center\nand upper right corner show solutions for R > 0.

Conclusions\nUsing a conformal transformation that amounts to finding the arc-length reparameterization\nof the given problem, we were able to construct a new metric, called Jacobi metric, such that\nits geodesic equation is equivalent to the original equations of motion.\nThen, we separated the given problem into its classical part and quantum fluctuations and,\nby realizing that the action written in terms of the Jacobi metric is the so-called \"energy\"\nin Morse Theory (resp. Morse-Bott theory), we see can reinterpret this as a \"topological\nexpansion\", in the sense that the quantum fluctuations are handles attached to the classical\nsolution.\nFurther, when these handles change the original (classical) topology, via the gluing of an\nappropriate \u03bd-cell, there is a phase transition, in the sense that we move from one solution\n[of our QFT] to another. This can be measured via the use of an Index Theorem: once it\nrelates the analytical index of the differential operator in question with the topological index\nof the manifold under study, we clearly see that if the topological index changes (because of a\ncertain handle attachment), the analytical index must change as well; which means that the\nzero modes, the solutions of the equations of motion, have to change.\nTherefore, by studying the geodesics obtained from the Jacobi metric with respect to its\nparameters, we can compute the topological index (via generalizations of the Gauss-Bonnet\ntheorem, using the Jacobi metric we derived before) and thus compute the zero-mode solutions\nwith respect to the different values of the parameters. In this way, we are able to classify all\npossible solutions to the QFT in question, keeping in mind that the quantum corrections are\ngiven by handle attachments that may or may not (depending on the values of the parameters)\nchange the topology of the classical solutions.\nTo this picture, we add Lee-Yang zeros and Stokes phenomena, in order to obtain a more\nrobust view of what is at stake: the Lee-Yang zeros accumulate along Stokes lines and pinch\nthe parameter space, creating different regions of \"allowed values\" for the parameters of the\ntheory (mass, coupling constants, etc). This represents different sectors of theory, different\nphases of the theory. And we showed that these are topologically inequivalent.\nIn this fashion, the partition function is meromorphic, once it is singular along the Stokes'\nlines. However, it has various degress of modular symmetry, depending on the particulars of\nthe theory in question. And, in this sense, different sectors of the theory are related to each\nother [by an appropriate modular transformation].\nIn turn, this implies that different solutions of the theory are related to each other, a fact\nthat we dubbed \"duality\". Ultimately, these dualities are determined by the actual values\nof the parameters (and how they compose in order to create the modular symmetry in question), which are determined by the boundary conditions of the Schwinger-Dyson equations\n(as explained earlier).\nFuture work will focus on D-modules and dimensional construction of 0-dimensional\ntheories (which can be completely solved). We also intend to generalize the cubic potential\nshowed earlier to matrix- and Lie-algebra-valued fields [32], analytically solving the its 0-\n\n\u2013 21 \u2013\n\n\fdimensional counterpart and dimensionally constructing it (via D-modules): it seems plausible\nthat such an extension might be related to current developments in three-dimensional gravity,\n[18].\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank C.
