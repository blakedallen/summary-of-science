Generally the PT\nsymmetric Hamiltonians involve complex potentials V (x)\nwith the property that V (\u2212x) = V \u2217 (x). It has been well\nknown in quantum mechanics that a complex potential\nimplies a source or sink of energy. The well known continuity equation has a nonconservative term which is proportional to V (x) \u2212 V \u2217 (x) = V (x) \u2212 V (\u2212x). Therefore\na consistent theoretical description should account for\nsuch sources or sinks of energy. In optical systems the\nrefractive index is like a potential [6] and since one can\nengineer different refractive indices, one effectively generates a very wide class of potentials leading to optical\nrealization of PT symmetric potentials as demonstrated\nby Ruter et al [7\u20139]. In optical realization of PT symmetric Hamiltonians one considers overall potential to be\ncomposed of two layers - layer A lying in the domain say\n\u22121 < x < 0 and a layer B in the domain in 0 < x < +1.\nThe two layers are characterized with complex optical\nsusceptibilities \u03c7 related to complex refractive index via\nn2 = 1 + 4\u03c0\u03c7 which are homogeneous and which have\nproperties Re[\u03c7A ] = Re[\u03c7B ] and Im[\u03c7A ] = \u2212Im[\u03c7B ].\nThe layer A could be a gain medium and then the layer B\nwould be an absorbing medium. Since the medium A is\na gain medium it must be pumped by an external source.\nThe medium B dissipates energy to an external environment. We must treat consistently these dissipative or\ngain environments, and this shows how PT symmetric\noptical systems can lead to significant spontaneous generation of photons. In the context of PT symmetric optical systems, the possibility of spontaneous generation,\nthough well known in lasers, has been missed so far. This\nwould be important when examining the transmission of\nsingle photons and entangled photons through PT symmetric structures. The transmission of single photons\nand in general quantum states of light through optical\nsystems like waveguides [10] with Im[\u03c7A ] = Im[\u03c7B ] = 0 is\ncurrently being studied extensively, particularly in quantum information science and in problems like quantum\nrandom walks [11].\nConsider the PT symmetric optical system shown in\n\nInput states-vacuum, single\nphoton or entangled\n\nJ\n\nA\nB\n\nDA\nDB\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) The PT symmetric optical system\nconsisting of two waveguides next to each other and coupled\nevanescently. The waveguide A(B) is filled with gain(lossy)\nmedium. DA and DB are the detectors at the output of A\nand B for measuring intensities and intensity correlations.\n\nFig. 1. The system consists of two single mode waveguides which are evanescently coupled. The waveguide A\nis filled with a gain medium whereas the waveguide B\nis filled with a lossy medium. The PT symmetry would\nrequire that the gain in A must be equal to absorption in\nB [12]. Let \u03b1 and \u03b2 be the classical field amplitudes in\nthe two waveguides. These amplitudes satisfy the basic\nequations\nd\u03b1\n= G\u03b1 \u2212 iJ\u03b2,\ndz\n\nd\u03b2\n= \u2212G\u03b2 \u2212 iJ\u03b1.\ndz\n\n(1)\n\nWe would now discuss the equations for the quantized\nfields in A and B. Let a, b (a\u2020 , b\u2020 ) be the annihilation (creation) operators for the fields in A and B. In\norder to obtain the quantized equations, we note that\nany gain or lossy medium leads to quantum fluctuations\nin the fields [13]. The basic equations can be derived\nfrom considerations of the microscopic Hamiltonian for\nthe radiation fields, pumping and loss mechanisms as is\nusually done in laser theory [14]. We recall from Eqs.\n(12.1.8) and (12.1.15) that the field mode a in a cavity containing an amplifying medium obeys the quantum\nLangevin equation \u0227 = ga + fa , where 2g is the gain\nand fa is a delta correlated force with zero mean value\nand with the only nonvanishing second order correlation\nhfa\u2020 (t)fa (t\u2032 )i = 2g\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ). The equations for a lossy\nmedium are similar (Ref. [14] Eqs. (9.1.15) and (9.1.27)\nwith thermal bath at zero temperature). We use the\nanalog of these equations for the waveguides. Further,\nthe evanescent part of the coupling is described by the\nHamiltonian [10] Jc(a\u2020 b+ab\u2020 ). The time in the equations\n\n\f2\nfrom laser theory is to be replaced by the propagation distance in the waveguides. For the PT symmetric optical\nsystems, the final quantum Langevin equations are\nda\ndb\n= Ga \u2212 iJb + fa ,\n= \u2212Gb \u2212 iJa + fb .\n(2)\ndz\ndz\nHere fa and fb are the quantum Langevin forces with\nzero mean and with the properties\nhfa\u2020 (z)fa (z \u2032 )i = 2G\u03b4(z \u2212 z \u2032 ),\nhfb\u2020 (z)fb (z \u2032 )i = 0,\n\nhfa (z)fa\u2020 (z \u2032 )i = 0,\n\nhfb (z)fb\u2020 (z \u2032 )i = 2G\u03b4(z \u2212 z \u2032 ),\n(3)\nFurther the fluctuating forces are Gaussian. Note the difference in the nature of Langevin forces in the equations\nfor the amplifying and absorbing medium. These quantum mechanical fluctuating forces in general would contribute to the output of the waveguides and significantly\nmodify the outputs. The quantum Langevin equations\n(2) can be integrated over the length l of the waveguide.\nWe write the solution as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013 Z l\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2032\nfa (l\u2032 )\na(0)\na(l)\n, (4)\n+\ndl\u2032 eJM(l\u2212l )\n= eJMl\nfb (l\u2032 )\nb(0)\nb(l)\n0\nwhere\n\nwhere Kij = (eJMl )ij . We have calculated analytically\nthe matrix K and the generated signals. We show in\nFig. 2, the nature of the spontaneous generation for different values of the gain both below and above threshold\ng = 1. The threshold is defined by the condition that the\neigenvalues of the matrix M change from pure imaginary\nto pure real values. We note from the Fig. 2 that the\ngeneration in the waveguide B starts later as initially the\ngeneration has to take place in the waveguide A and this\nmust tunnel into the waveguide B to see the generation\nin the waveguide B. For large g the generation in the\nwaveguide A dominates over that in B\nSa \u2192 e2gl ,\nS\n50 (a)\n40\n\ng=0.9\n\n30\n20\n10\n\ng=0.5\n\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nG\n.\n(5)\nJ\np\n2\nThe matrix\np M has the eigenvalues \u00b1i 1 \u2212 g if g =\n2\nG/J < 1, \u00b1 g \u2212 1 if g > 1. The intensities at the output l = Jz are obtained by calculating Ia = ha\u2020 (l)a(l)i,\nIb = hb\u2020 (l)b(l)i for a variety of input states. The input states could be single photon states like |1,\u221a\n0i, |0, 1i\nand even a NOON state like (|0, 2i + |2, 0i)/ 2. We\nnext give explicit results for a variety of input quantum\nstates in the PT symmetric optical system. Note that the\nbiorthogonal modes of the PT symmetric optical system\nare given by the eigenstates of M. In view of the presence\nof quantum Langevin terms in Eq.(4) the eigenmodes of\nthe system are strongly correlated.\nM=\n\ng \u2212i\n\u2212i g\n\n,\n\ng=\n\nSpontaneous Generation of Photons in PT\nSymmetric Optical Systems\n\nLet us first consider the most intriguing possibility of\nspontaneous generation in PT symmetric systems. In\nthis case the input state of photons is |0, 0i. Further the\nquantum noise in the absorber does not contribute to the\nnormally ordered moments and thus only fa terms contribute to spontaneous generation. Using Eq.(3) and (4)\nwe can show that the spontaneous generation, denoted\nby the symbol S, is given by\nZ l\ndl\u2032 |Kaa (l\u2032 )|2 ,\nSa (l) = 2g\n0\n(6)\nZ l\nSb (l) = 2g\n\n0\n\ndl\u2032 |Kba (l\u2032 )|2 ,\n\nSb \u2192\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nS\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\nJl\n\n1 2gl\ne .\n4g 2\n\n15\n\n(b)\n\n10\n\n(7)\n\ng=1.5\n\n5\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n\ng=1.2\n\nJl\n0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Spontaneous generation of the radiation in PT symmetric optical systems. The solid and dashed\ncurves give respectively the output of the waveguides A and\nB. Notice the dashed curves are multiplied by a factor of 10.\nThe part (a)[(b)] is for g < 1[> 1].\n\nVacuum Induced HBT Cross Correlation\n\nWe next examine the HBT [15] cross correlation between the outputs of the two waveguides. We expect\nsuch a cross correlation to be nonzero as the generation\nin B is due to generation in A and due to tunneling effects. Let us define a correlation coefficient as\nq(l) = g (2) \u2212 1,\ng (2) =\n\nha\u2020 (l)b\u2020 (l)a(l)b(l)i\n.\nha\u2020 (l)a(l)ihb\u2020 (l)b(l)i\n\n(8)\n\nThe term ha\u2020 (l)b\u2020 (l)a(l)b(l)i is proportional to the probability of simultaneously detecting one photon each in\nthe output of both A and B waveguides. This can be\nevaluated by using the Gaussian nature of the Langevin\nforces fa and fb which implies that the Heisenberg operators are also Gaussian with the provision that we need\nto keep track of the operator characteristics. This applies\nonly to the problem of spontaneous generation. It can be\nshown using the Gaussian property that\nha\u2020 (l)b\u2020 (l)a(l)b(l)i\n\n= ha\u2020 (l)a(l)ihb\u2020 (l)b(l)i + ha\u2020 (l)b(l)ihb\u2020 (l)a(l)i (9)\n\n\f3\nand hence\n2\n\n\u2020\n\nq(l) =\n\n2\n\n|ha (l)b(l)| i\n|Sab |\n=\n,\nSa Sb\nSa Sb\n\n(10)\n\nThe term ha\u2020 (l)b(l)i is obtained from (4) as\nZ l\n\u2020\n\u2217\nha (l)b(l)i = 2g\ndl\u2032 Kaa\n(l\u2032 )Kba (l\u2032 ).\n\n(11)\n\n0\n\nThe nature of the vacuum induced HBT cross correlation\nbetween the outputs of the two waveguides is shown in\nFig. 3. The behavior of the HBT correlation is quite\ndifferent for g < 1 and g > 1. For g > 1, the correlation\nsaturates to unity, whereas for g < 1, it tends to remain,\nin most cases, much smaller than unity. This is due to the\ndistinction in the nature of the eigenvalues as discussed\nafter Eq.(5). Thus for large gain, the correlations or the\nfluctuations are maximally Gaussian in the sense that the\nmaximum value of g (2) can be 2, and hence maximum\nvalue of q will be 1.\nSab 2\nSa Sb\n1.0\n\nSab 2\nSa Sb\ng=1.2\ng=1.5\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n(a)\n\n(a)\n\ng=0.5\n\nJl\n2.5 3.0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nJl\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Vacuum induced (HBT) cross correlation between the outputs of the two waveguides.\n\n(b)\n\n200\nQM\n\nQM\n\n150\n\nCL\n\n100\n50\nCL\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nJl\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\nJl\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\nIa, Ib\n4\n\n6\n\ng=0.9\n\n(b)\n\n0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0\n\nIa, Ib\n\nIa, Ib\n\ng=0.3\n\n0.6\n\ng=2.0\n\nIa, Ib\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n\n2\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\nHence asymptotically negligibly small output is there\nfrom the waveguide B. In Fig. 4 we present explicit results\nfor the stimulated generation and the total generation for\nthe input single photon either in the waveguide A or in B.\nThe stimulated part is same as from Eq.(1) and hence labeled as \"CL\"(Classical) in Fig. 4. The curves labeled as\n\"QM\"(quantum) include contributions from both stimulated and spontaneous generation. The behavior is quite\ndifferent for g < 1 and for g > 1. For g < 1, we find\nthat total generation of photons is dominated by spontaneous generation. The situation is somewhat different\nfor g > 1. However, spontaneous generation still remains\nquite important.\n\n50 54\nQM\n3\n40 2\nCL\n1\n30 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0Jl\n20\n(c)\n10\n\n80 3\n\n40\n20\nCL\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nQM\n\n2\n60 1\n\nQM\n\n8\n\n10\n\nJl\n\nCL\nQM\n\nJl\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n\n(d)\nCL\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\nJl\n2.5\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) The mean number of photons in the\noutput of waveguides A (solid curves) and B (dashed curves)\nwhen the input state is |1, 0i (panels a, b), |0, 1i (panels c, d).\nPanels a and c are for g = 0.9; panels b and d for g = 1.5.\n\nStimulated vs Spontaneous Generation in PT\nSymmetric Optical Systems\n\nWe would now consider the stimulated generation by\nsingle photon input states and compare the stimulated\ngeneration with spontaneous generation.\n\u0012 The\n\u0013 stimulated\nMl a(0)\nin Eq.(4).\ngeneration comes from the terms e\nb(0)\nFor the input |1, 0i the stimulated generation is given by\nIast = |Kaa (l)|2 ,\n\nIbst = |Kba (l)|2 ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhereas for the input single photon in the waveguide B,\nthe stimulated generation is given by\nIast = |Kab (l)|2 ,\n\nIbst = |Kbb (l)|2 .\n\n(13)\n\nNote that for large propagation distance and g > 1, the\nstimulated generation is determined by\n1 2gl\n|Kaa (l)| \u2192 e ,\n|Kbb (l)| \u2192\ne ,\n16g 4\n1\n|Kab (l)|2 = |Kba (l)|2 \u2192 2 e2gl .\n4g\n2\n\n2gl\n\n2\n\n(14)\n\nHBT Correlations for Input Fields in a NOON State\n\nLastly we examine the behavior of optical fields in PT\nsymmetric systems when \u221a\nthe input fields are in a NOON\nstate [16] (|0, 2i + |2, 0i)/ 2 which is an entangled state.\nFor this state g (2) has the least value which is zero.

The behavior in Fig.\np 5c can be understood in\nterms of the eigenvalues \u00b1i 1 \u2212 g 2 of M for g < 1, as\nin this case we have periodic exchange of energy between\nthe two waveguides. Fig. 5c and Fig. 5d show that g (2)\nis mostly less than unity if the spontaneous generation\nis ignored whereas the inclusion of spontaneous emission changes the character of g (2) completely (Fig. 5a\nand Fig. 5b). Thus noninclusion of spontaneous emission would lead to erroneous conclusion that the fields in\nPT symmetric system are nonclassical whereas the correct behavior leads to nonclassicality only over a small\nrange of propagation distance.\na \u2020b\u2020 ab\n\u2020\n\na \u2020b\u2020 ab\n\n\u2020\n\na \u2020 a b\u2020 b\n\naa bb\n\n1.5\n\ng=0.9\ng=0.5\n\n1.0\n0.5\n\n(a)\n\na \u2020b\u2020 ab\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\nJl\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\nJl\n3.0\n\na \u2020 a b\u2020 b\n\n1.0\n0.8\n\n(b)\n\na \u2020b\u2020 ab\n\na \u2020 a b\u2020 b\n\ng=1.5\n\ng=1.2\n\n1.0\ng=0.5\n\n(c)\n\ng=0.9\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n(d)\n\n0.8\n\n10\n\nJl\n\ng=1.5\ng=1.2\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\nJl\n3.0\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) HBT cross correlation between the\ntwo waveguides\nwhen the input is a NOON state (|2, 0i +\n\u221a\n|0, 2i)/ 2. In panels a and b, we consider both spontaneous\nand stimulated generation; while in panels c and d, we consider only the stimulated one.\n\nIn summary we have shown how important is the spontaneous generation of photons in PT symmetric optical\nsystems. We show significant HBT correlations in the\ngenerated photon fields. The spontaneously generated\nphotons strongly correlate eigenmodes and determine the\nquantum nature of the fields containing single and entangled photons in such systems. There are many other important systems involving for example the lossless propagation in plasmonic structures [17] where losses are compensated by gain media. While dealing with quantum\nfields in such structures one has to supplement Maxwell\n\nequations with quantum Langevin terms of the type discussed in the current work. These ideas would also be\napplicable, say, in the context of matter waves where a\nwhole class of potentials including complex ones can be\nconstructed by using off resonant laser fields [18].\nGSA thanks K.
