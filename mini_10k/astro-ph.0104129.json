After taking into account, for the first time, the detailed\nsystematic variation of horizontal-branch (HB) morphology with age and\nmetallicity, our population synthesis models show that the integrated H\u03b2\nindex is significantly affected by the presence of blue HB stars. Our\nmodels indicate that the strength of the H\u03b2 index increases as much as\n0.75 \u00c5 due to blue HB stars. According to our models, a systematic\ndifference between the globular cluster system in the Milky Way Galaxy\nand that in NGC 1399 in the H\u03b2 vs. Mg2 diagram is understood if\nglobular cluster systems in giant elliptical galaxies are couple of billion\nyears older, in the mean, than the Galactic counterpart.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nFor distant stellar populations, one relies upon the integrated colors or spectra\nto investigate their ages and metallicities since individual stars are not resolved.\nHere, we specifically focus on the H\u03b2 index, which is widely used as an age\nindicator. Most of the previous works (e.g., Worthey 1994), however, have been\ndone on the basis that stars near the main-sequence turnoff (MSTO) region are\nthe most dominant sources for the integrated strength of H\u03b2. Consequently,\nwithout meticulous consideration for stars beyond the red giant branch, they\nclaimed that the strength of H\u03b2 depends on the location of the MSTO, which in\nturn depends on the age at a given metallicity. Several investigators, however,\nhave cast some doubt upon the sensitivity of the H\u03b2 index given the presence\nof other warm stars, especially blue horizontal-branch (HB) stars (see, e.g.,\nBurstein et al. 1984; Jorgensen 1997).\nOn the observational side, it was barely possible to obtain low signal-tonoise (S/N) spectra of globular clusters in systems outside the Local Group\n(e.g., Mould et al. 1990). These spectra have been useful only for kinematic\ninformation. With the advent of 10 m-class telescopes, however, Kissler-Patig\net al. (1998) and Cohen, Blakeslee, & Ryzhov (1998) have successfully obtained\nrelatively high S/N spectra that provide reliable line index calibration for globular clusters in NGC 1399 and M87, the central giant elliptical galaxies in Fornax\nand Virgo clusters.\n\n1\n\n\fAge Estimation Using H\u03b2 Index\n2.\n\n2\n\nPopulation Models with Horizontal-Branch Stars\n\nFor our population models, the Yale Isochrones (Demarque et al. 1996), rescaled\nfor \u03b1-element enhancement (Salaris, Chieffi, & Straniero 1993), and the HB evolutionary tracks by Yi, Demarque, & Kim (1997) have been used. The Salpeter\n(1955) initial mass function is adopted for the relative number of stars along\nthe isochrones. For the conversion from theoretical quantities to observable\nquantities, we have taken the most recently compiled stellar library of Lejeune, Cuisinier, & Buser (1998) in order to cover the largest possible ranges in\nstellar parameters such as metallicity, temperature, and gravity. The detailed\ncalculation method of spectral index is presented in Lee, Yoon, & Lee (2000).\nIn Figure 1a, the variations of H\u03b2 strength as a function of metallicity (Mg2 )\nare plotted at given ages. Here, \u2206t = 0 Gyr corresponds the recently favored\nmean age of Galactic globular clusters (\u223c 12 Gyr) in the light of new distance\nscale as suggested by HIPPARCOS (e.g., Chaboyer et al. 1998). Note that,\nunlike the models without HB stars (dashed lines), distinct \"wavy\" features\nappear in our models with HB stars (solid lines). It is found that the strength of\nH\u03b2 does not simply decrease with either increasing age or increasing metallicity\nonce HB stars are included in the models. Now it is evident that the blue HB\nstars around (B \u2212 V )o \u223c 0 are the key contributors for the strength of H\u03b2. The\ndifferences in H\u03b2 strengths between the models with and without HB stars are\nas much as 0.75 \u00c5 at the peak. In addition, it should be noted that the peak of\nthe H\u03b2 enhancement moves to higher metallicity as age gets older.\n3.\n\nComparison with Observations\n\nHaving confirmed that the detailed modeling of HB is crucial in the use of H\u03b2\nindex as an age indicator, Figure 1b compares our results with observations\nof globular cluster systems in the Milky Way Galaxy and in NGC 1399. It\nis important to note here that all of these observations were carried out at the\nKeck telescope with the identical instrumental configuration, the Low Resolution\nImaging Spectrograph (LRIS, Oke, de Zeeuw, & Nemec 1995). Despite the still\nlarge observational uncertainties, it is inferred from Figure 1b that the NGC\n1399 globular cluster system is perhaps systematically couple of billion years\nolder, in the mean, than the Galactic counterpart.\nIt is of considerable interest, in this respect, to find that a similar age\ndifference is inferred from the \"metal-poor HB solution\" of the UV upturn phenomenon of local giant elliptical galaxies (Park & Lee 1997; Yi et al. 1999). If\nour age estimation is confirmed to be correct, this would indicate that the star\nformation in denser environments has proceeded much more rapidly and efficiently, so that the initial epoch of star formation in more massive (and denser)\nsystems occurred several billion years earlier than that of the Milky Way (see\nalso Lee 1992).\nReferences\nBurstein, D., Faber, S.
