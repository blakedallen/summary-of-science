The result is given in terms\nof standard polylogarithms of uniform transcendental weight three, its functional form resembling\nthe one of the remainder function of the two-loop hexagon Wilson loop in four dimensions.\n\nIn this short note we are concerned with the computation of the scalar one-loop integral in D = 6 dimensions,\nI6D=6 =\n\nZ\n\n5\nd6 k Y 1\n,\ni\u03c0 3 i=0 Di\n\n(1)\n\nwith\nD0 = k 2 and Di = (k + pi )2 , for i = 1, . . . , 5 .\n\n(2)\n\nThe external momenta, labeled by pi , i = 1, . . . , 6, are\nlightlike, p2i = 0, and all ingoing, such that momentum\nconservation reads\n6\nX\n\npi = 0 .\n\n(3)\n\ni=1\n\nWe consider the integral in Euclidean kinematics where\nall Mandelstam invariants are taken to be negative,\n(p1 + . . .+ pj )2 < 0, and the integral is real. The massless\nhexagon integral is finite in D = 6 dimension, so that no\nregularization is required and we can perform the computation in strictly six dimensions.\nWe introduce dual coordinates [1, 2],\npi = xi \u2212 xi+1 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwith x7 = x1 , due to momentum conservation. Since the\nintegration measure in Eq. (1) is translation invariant, we\ncan define k = x0 \u2212 x1 and the integral can be rewritten\ncompletely in terms of dual coordinates,\nZ 6\n1\nd x0\n,\n(5)\nI6D=6 =\ni\u03c0 3 x201 x202 x203 x204 x205 x206\nwith x2ij = (xi \u2212 xj )2 = (pi + . . . + pj\u22121 )2 . In Ref. [1]\nthe notion of dual conformal invariance was introduced,\ni.e., the action of the conformal group on the dual coordinates xi . The integral (5) transforms covariantly under\ndual conformal transformations. In fact, invariance under rotations and translations is manifest, whereas under dilatations and inversions the integral transforms\n\ncovariantly with weight one at each external point xi ,\nnamely under dilatations, xi \u2192 \u03bb xi , the integral scales\nas I6D=6 \u2192 \u03bb\u22126 I6D=6 , whereas under inversions xi \u2192\nxi /(x2i )2 the measure and the propagators transform as\nd6 x0 \u2192 d6 x0 /(x20 )6 and x2ij \u2192 x2ij /(x2i x2j ), such that\nQ6\nI6D=6 \u2192 I6D=6 i=1 x2i . Note that for dual conformal\ninvariance to hold it is crucial that we work in strictly\nsix dimensions. Finally, the previous considerations are\nnot restricted to I6D=6 , but exactly the same reasoning\nshows that every finite one-loop n-gon in D = n dimensions is dual conformally covariant.\nA direct consequence of the dual conformal covariance\nof I6D=6 is that the integral can only depend on dual\nconformal cross ratios, up to an overall prefactor which\ncarries the conformal weights. For the massless six-point\nkinematics, there are three independent cross ratios [3],\ngiven in terms of dual coordinates by,\nu1 =\n\nx226 x235\nx231 x246\nx215 x224\n,\nu\n=\n,\nu\n=\n.\n2\n3\nx214 x225\nx225 x236\nx236 x241\n\n(6)\n\nMore precisely, the integral can be written in the form\nI6D=6 =\n\n1\nI6 (u1 , u2 , u3 ) .\nx214 x225 x236\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the function I6 (u1 , u2 , u3 ) is manifestly dual conformal invariant. Furthermore, the integral I6D=6 as a\nfunction of the external momenta pi has a dihedral symmetry D6 generated by cyclic rotations pi \u2192 pi+1 and\nthe reflection pi \u2192 p6\u2212i+1 . It is easy to check that\nthe dihedral symmetry of I6D=6 implies that the function I6 (u1 , u2 , u3 ) must be totally symmetric in the three\ncross ratios.\nWe start by deriving a Mellin-Barnes (MB) representation for I6D=6 using the AMBRE package [4]. Although\nthe integral is finite, the resulting MB representation has\na spurious singularity that must cancel in the end. We\ntherefore derive the MB representation in D = 6 \u2212 2\u01eb\ndimensions and resolve the singularities in \u01eb using the\nstrategy introduced in Refs. [5\u20138] by applying the codes\nMB [9] and MBresolve [10] and obtain a set of MB inte-\n\n\f2\ngrals which can be safely expanded in \u01eb under the integration sign. After applying these codes, all the integration\ncontours are straight vertical lines. At the end of this\nprocedure, all the poles in \u01eb cancel and we are left with a\nmanifestly finite and conformally invariant threefold MB\nintegral to compute,\n!\nZ +i\u221e Y\n3\ndzi\n\u0393(\u2212zi )2 uzi i\nI6 =\n2\u03c0i\n(8)\n\u2212i\u221e\ni=1\n\u00d7 \u0393(1 + z1 + z2 ) \u0393(1 + z2 + z3 ) \u0393(1 + z3 + z1 ) ,\n\nwhere the contours are straight vertical lines whose real\nparts are given by\n1\n1\n1\nRe(z1 ) = \u2212 , Re(z2 ) = \u2212 , Re(z3 ) = \u2212 .\n3\n4\n5\n\n(9)\n\nAlbeit simpler, the integral (8) is similar to the threefold\nMB integral contributing to the two-loop hexagon Wilson\nloop in N = 4 Super Yang-Mills [11, 12], hence it can be\ncomputed in the same fashion. Following the strategy\nof Ref. [12], we can turn each MB integration into an\nEuler-type integral via the formula,\nZ\n\n+i\u221e\n\ndz\n\u0393(\u2212z) \u0393(c \u2212 z) \u0393(b + z) \u0393(c + z) X z\n\u2212i\u221e 2\u03c0i\nZ 1\n= \u0393(a) \u0393(b + c)\ndv v b\u22121 (1 \u2212 v)a+c\u22121 (1 \u2212 Xv)\u2212a ,\n0\n\n(10)\n\nwith X = 1 \u2212 X and where the contours are such as to\nseparate the poles in \u0393(. . . \u2212 zi ) from those in \u0393(. . . + zi ).\nThis leaves us with the following three-fold parametric\nintegral to compute,\n!\nZ 1 Y\n3\n1\ndvi\nI6 =\n1\n\u2212\nv\n(1\n\u2212 u1 v1 )\n2\n0\ni=1\n\u00d7\n\n1\n.\n1 \u2212 v1 (1 \u2212 u2 \u2212 v3 (1 \u2212 u2 \u2212 u3 v2 )) \u2212 (1 \u2212 u3 v2 )v3\n(11)\n\nThe integral is easily performed in terms of multiple\npolylogarithms [13]. The resulting expression is rather\nlengthy and involves a combination of multiple polylogarithms of uniform weight three, whose arguments are\ncomplicated algebraic functions involving the square root\nof the quantity,\n\u2206 = (u1 + u2 + u3 \u2212 1)2 \u2212 4u1 u2 u3 .\n\n(12)\n\nHowever, the similarity between the MB integral (8) and\nthe corresponding integral of Ref. [12] suggests that it\nshould be possible to rewrite the answer in a simpler\nform, in the same way as the analytic result of Ref. [12]\nwas rewritten in simplified form in Ref. [14]. The cornerstone of the simplification of the two-loop six-point\n\nremainder function was the so-called symbol map, a linear map S that associates a certain tensor to an iterated\nintegral, and thus to a multiple polylogarithm. In the\nfollowing we give a very brief summary of the symbol\ntechnique, referring to Ref. [14] for further details. As an\nexample, the tensor associated to the classical polylogarithm Lin (x) is,\nS(Lin (x)) = \u2212(1 \u2212 x) \u2297 x \u2297 . . . \u2297 x .\n| {z }\n\n(13)\n\n(n\u22121) times\n\nFurthermore, the tensor maps products that appear inside the tensor product to a sum of tensors,\n. . . \u2297 (x * y) \u2297 . . . = . . . \u2297 x \u2297 . . . + . . . \u2297 y \u2297 . . . . (14)\nIt is conjectured that all the functional identities among\n(multiple) polylogarithms are mapped under the symbol\nmap S to algebraic relations among the tensors. Hence,\nif the symbol map is applied to our complicated expression for I6 (u1 , u2 , u3 ), it should capture and resolve all\nthe functional identities among the polylogarithms, and\ntherefore allow us to rewrite the result in a simpler form.\nIn order to apply this technology, it is however important that all the arguments that enter the tensor be multiplicatively independent. As in our case the arguments\nof the polylogarithms involve square roots of \u2206, this requirement is not fulfilled. In Ref. [14] a reparametrization\nof the cross ratios ui in terms of six points zi in CP1 was\nproposed,\nu1 =\n\nz23 z56\nz34 z61\nz45 z12\n, u2 =\n, u3 =\n,\nz25 z36\nz36 z41\nz41 z52\n\n(15)\n\nwith zij = zi \u2212 zj . It is easy to check that with this\nparametrization the right-hand side of Eq. (12) becomes\na perfect square. Hence, after this reparametrization all\nthe arguments of the polylogarithms are rational functions in the zij variables, making this parametrization\nwell suited to apply the symbol map S.\nUsing the parametrization (15) and the symbol map, it\nis easy to construct a simpler candidate expression with\nthe same symbol as our original expression. However, the\nkernel of the map S is non trivial, and it allows us to fix\nthe candidate expression only up to terms proportional\nto zeta values, which in turn must be fixed by looking at\nparticular values of the cross ratios. At the end of this\nprocedure, we arrive at the following expression for the\nscalar massless hexagon integral,\n\"\n3\nX\n1\n\u2212\nL3 (x+\n\u22122\nI6 (u1 , u2 , u3 ) = \u221a\ni , xi )\n\u2206\ni=1\n!3\n3\n1 X\n+\n\u2212\n(16)\n+\nl1 (xi ) \u2212 l1 (xi )\n3 i=1\n#\n3\n\u03c02 X\n\u2212\n(l1 (x+\n\u03c7\n+\ni ) \u2212 l1 (xi )) ,\n3\ni=1\n\n\f3\nat u1 = u2 = u3 = 1, and it is easy to check that in this\ncase the weight drops by one unit,\n\nwhere\n\u00b1\nx\u00b1\ni = ui x ,\n\n\u221a\nu1 + u2 + u3 \u2212 1 \u00b1 \u2206\n\u00b1\n,\nx =\n2u1 u2 u3\n\n(17)\nlim I6 (u1 , u2 , u3 ) =\n\nui \u21921\n\nand \u2206 is defined in Eq.

(16) is of manifestly uniform\ntranscendental weight three. Secondly, we performed the\ncomputation in the Euclidean region where the integral\nis real and all Mandelstam invariants are taken to be negative, and hence the cross ratios are positive. Eq. (16)\nis proportional to the square root of \u2206, which becomes\npurely imaginary for certain values of the cross ratios in\nthe Euclidean region. It is easy to see that in the region\nwhere \u2206 < 0, the variables x\u00b1\ni are complex conjugate to\neach other, such that\n\u0001\n\u2212\n+\nln (x+\ni ) \u2212 ln (xi ) = 2i Im ln (xi ) ,\n\nWe evaluated the massless one-loop hexagon integral in\nsix dimensions. The result is given in terms of standard\npolylogarithms of uniform transcendental weight three,\nits functional form resembling the one of the remainder\nfunction of the two-loop hexagon Wilson loop in four dimensions, which has uniform weight four. Thus, it is\nnatural to expect that one-loop hexagon integrals in six\ndimensions be used as a computational probe of two-loop\namplitudes and Wilson loops, yet to be evaluated.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe authors are grateful to Lance Dixon for useful\ndiscussions.

(16) are fixed by assigning a small positive\nimaginary part to each of the x\u00b1\ni , i.e., all the polylogarithms are interpreted as ln (x\u00b1\ni + i\u03b5). In order to account for discontinuities in the ln functions, we need\nto introduce the parameter \u03c7, and the resulting expression (16) is smooth everywhere. Alternatively, we can\nchoose \u03c7 = 1 everywhere, to the price of evaluating some\nof the polylogarithms on a different Riemann sheet. To\nsee this, note that in the region where \u2206 < 0, we have\nsign(Im(x\u00b1\ni )) = \u00b11 and \u03c7 = 1. Hence, if \u2206 becomes\n\u2212\npositive, x+\ni (xi ) approaches the real axis from above\n(below). Thus we can choose \u03c7 = 1 even for \u2206 > 0,\nbut we have to evaluate the polylogarithms with a modified i\u03b5 prescription, ln (x\u00b1\ni \u00b1 i\u03b5). Finally, let us comment on what happens at \u2206 = 0. Eq. (16) apparently\nhas a singularity at these points. However, it is easy to\n\u2212\nsee that if \u2206 vanishes, the combination ln (x+\ni ) \u2212 ln (xi )\nmust vanish accordingly, and the resulting expression\nstays finite. In particular, it follows from Corollary 26\nof Ref. [15] that for \u2206 = 0 the weight of the expression\nmust drop to less than three. As an example, \u2206 vanishes\n\n[1] J. M. Drummond, J.
