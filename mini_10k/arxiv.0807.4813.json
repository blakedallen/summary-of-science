In many applications a\nlinearly increasing load is applied to the system and the rupture force distribution is monitored as a function of the loading rate, yielding information about the details of the rupture\nevent such as the possible existence of intermediates. Similar to other single molecule techniques, such as single molecule fluorescence (SMF) or single channel recording, DFS is able\nto disentangle complex reaction pathways[2, 3]. Two setups are usually employed to determine bond-strengths or bond-lifetimes. In the linear loading mode, a force proportional\nto the observation time is applied, e.g. by moving the cantilever of an atomic force microscope away from the surface. Force-clamp spectroscopy (FCS), on the other hand, exerts\na constant load on the bond, i.e. a fixed force is applied. In the latter case, one observes\nindividual unbinding/rebinding events of the molecular system as a function of time. In\nboth cases characteristic forces are in the pN-regime and bond-lifetimes are on the order\nof seconds[4, 5]. The theoretical models usually employed to describe the rupture process\ndescribe the dynamics in the direction of the reaction coordinate in terms of diffusive barrier crossing[6]. The rupture force or time is calculated from the mean first passage time\n\n\f2\nin a potential consisting of the molecular potential and the harmonic potential describing\nthe application of the force[7, 8, 9]. So far, predominantly irreversible rupture events have\nbeen investigated, both theoretically and experimentally. More recently, reversible systems\nwith finite rebinding rates came into focus[10, 11, 12]. Experimentally, reversible unfolding/refolding transitions have been observed in a variety of natural systems, such as RNA\nhairpins[13, 14] and ubiquitin[15] as well as specially designed molecules such as calixarene\ncatenanes[16]. In these systems fluctuations are observed due to the statistical nature of\nthe transitions between a 'closed-bond' and an 'open-bond' conformation. While in the\ncontext of SMF it is standard to analyze the fluctuations in the photon counts a treatment\nof the mentioned fluctuations in DFS is missing.\nIn the present letter we develop the theory for the analysis of the fluctuations observed\nin FCS experiments of systems that show reversible bond-breaking events. We consider\nunbinding/rebinding transitions between two states, a 'closed-bond' state A and an 'openbond' state B with rates koff (fext ) for A \u2192 B-transitions and kon (fext ) for the reverse transition, where fext denotes the externally applied force. While for time-independent rates\nkoff (fext ) and kon (fext ), the process is Markovian, we additionally consider non-Markovian\nfluctuations. SMF has proven to be a versatile tool to observe deviations from Markovian\nbehavior, for a review see [17]. In the context of DFS a brief discussion of non-Markovian\nfluctuations has been given by Hyeon and Thirumalai[18]. The impact of such fluctuations\non experimental results apparently has not been considered in a quantitative manner up\nto now. However, non-Markovian fluctuations can be expected to be of importance in\nparticular when considering the dynamics of protein-unfolding and refolding due to the\ncomplex nature of this phenomenon[19].\nIn order to be able to describe the statistics of the unbinding/rebinding events, we\nconsider the probability of finding the system in either state together with the number of\ntransitions that have already occurred at time t, cf. Fig.1.\nFor the formal treatment, one considers the process consisting of the two variables\n{q(t), m(t)}, where q(t) denotes the reaction coordinate and m(t) the number of transitions.\nIn the two-state approximation the distribution is given by p(q, m; t) \u2243 nA (m; t)peq\nA (q) +\neq\nnB (m; t)peq\nB (q) with the equilibrium populations pX (q), X = A, B. Here, we assumed\n\nthat the intra-well relaxation is fast compared to the time scale of koff and kon (adiabatic\napproximation). The quantities nX (m; t) obey the master equation [20, 21]:\n\u2202t nA (m; t) = \u2212koff (fext )nA (m; t) + kon (fext )nB (m \u2212 1; t)\n\n\f3\n\u2202t nB (m; t) = \u2212kon (fext )nB (m; t) + koff (fext )nA (m; t)\n\n(1)\n\nIn this form, the fluctuations in the number of transitions become evident. In particular,\nthe marginal distributions nX (t) =\n\nP\u221e\n\nm=0\n\nnX (m; t) and p\u0304(m; t) =\n\nR\n\ndqp(q, m; t) can be\n\ncomputed. The global populations nX (t) are those considered in the mentioned previous\ntreatments[10, 11, 12] and nA (t) is related to the survival probability p(\u03c4 ) = \u2212dnA (\u03c4 )/d\u03c4 =\nkoff (fext ) exp (\u2212[koff (fext ) + kon (fext )]\u03c4 ). It is to be noted that g(\u03c4 ) = \u03c4 p(\u03c4 ) shows strong\ndeviations from Poisson behavior if kon (fext ) \u223c koff (fext ), i.e. if the equilibrium constant\nKeq (fext ) =\nis near unity.\n\nIn addition,\n\nkon (fext )\nkoff (fext )\n\n(2)\n\nthe correlation time,\n\nh\u03c4 i\n\n=\n\nR\u221e\n0\n\ndt[p(t)t]\n\n=\n\nkoff (fext )/ [koff (fext ) + kon (fext )]2 , shows a maximum as a function of the force. In the\n(Bell)\n\nBell-limit (large fA and fB , cf. Fig.1c), koff\n\n0 \u03b1A f\n(Bell)\n0 \u2212\u03b1B f\n(f ) = koff\ne\nand kon\n(f ) = kon\ne\n, this\n\nmaximum is located at f\u03c4 = ln [Keq (0)(1 + 2\u03b1B /\u03b1A )]/(\u03b1A + \u03b1B ). For the parameters given\nin the caption to Fig.1, one finds in this approximation f\u03c4 \u2243 45.3 pN, while for the general\n0 \u03b1A f (1\u2212f /fA )\n0 \u2212\u03b1B f (1+f /fB )\nKramers rates koff (f ) = koff\ne\nand kon (f ) = kon\ne\none has a value of\n\n41.4 pN, a deviation of 10%.\nThe subsequent analysis of eq.(1) proceeds in the same way as in ref.[21]. We introduce\ngenerating functions\nGX (z; t) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nz m nX (m; t) (X = A, B)\n\n(3)\n\nm=0\n\nfrom which all quantities of interest can be calculated[22]. In the present letter we focus\non the first and second moments of the distribution of the number of A \u2194 B-transitions,\nhN(t)i and hN(t)2 i. The latter will be discussed in terms of Mandels Q-parameter[17],\nQ(t) = [hN(t)2 i \u2212 hN(t)i2 ] /hN(t)i\u22121. This quantity will be shown to be highly susceptible\nto subtle changes ion the energy landscape. As described in detail in ref.[21], the generating\nfunctions can be used to calculate these quantities. Starting in state A initially, G(z; t) =\nGA (z; t) + GB (z; t) reads:\n\"\n\nW (z) \u2212 Keq \u2212 1\nW (z) + Keq + 1\nE1 (z; t) +\nE2 (z; t)\nG(z; t) =\n2W (z)\n2W (z)\nwith W (z) =\n\nq\n\n(Keq \u2212 1)2 + 4zKeq , E1/2 (z; t) =\n\nD\n\n\u0010\n\nexp \u2212\u03c11/2 (z)\n\nRt\n\n#\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\n0 dt koff (fext , t )\n\n(4)\n\u0011E\n\nand\n\n\u03c11/2 (z) = 12 [(Keq + 1) \u2213 W (z)]. Here, we already allowed for a possible time-dependence of\nkoff (fext , t) due to environmental fluctuations and the brackets indicate the average over the\ndisorder. However, in this case, the employed formalism can only be used if we assume a\n\n\f4\nunique Keq (fext ) = kon (fext , t)/koff (fext , t) to exist. For Markovian fluctuations, one simply\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nhas E1/2 (z; t) = exp \u2212\u03c11/2 (z)koff (fext )t .\nThe mean number of transitions hN(t)i after a short time (on the order of the inverse\nequilibrium constant), where it depends on the actual initial conditions, grows linearly\nwith slope\nR = lim\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nkoff (fext )kon (fext )\nd\nhN(t)i =\ndt\nkoff (fext ) + kon (fext )\n\n(5)\n\nFor the parameters given in the caption to Fig.1, we plot hN(t)i versus time in the upper panel of Fig.2 along with results from a kinetic Monte Carlo simulation of the same\nsystem[23]. It is evident that also for times on the order of koff one can observe the linear\nbehavior. The slope R according to eq.(5) is given as a function of the external force in\nthe inset. It shows a maximum as a function of fext , which in the Bell-limit is located at\nfR = ln [Keq (0)(\u03b1A /\u03b1B )]/(\u03b1A + \u03b1B ) (deviations from Kramers results \u223c 10%).\nThe Q-parameter tends towards a constant value for long times:\nQ\u221e = lim Q(t) = \u22122\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nKeq (fext )\n[Keq (fext ) + 1]2\n\n(6)\n\nas shown in the lower panel of Fig.2. Again, the Monte Carlo simulation results coincide with the analytical calculation, showing that Q(t) can be extracted accurately\nfrom noisy (experimental) data. The minimum in Q\u221e in the Bell-limit is located at\nfQ = ln [Keq (0)]/(\u03b1A + \u03b1B ) (deviations from Kramers results \u223c 20%).\nThese considerations show that it should be possible to extract both, hN(t)i and Q(t)\nfrom experimental data. For carrying out force-clamp experiments it is, however, highly\nadvisable to carefully adjust filters that are meant to reduce instrumental noise but might\nsuppress fluctuations that essentially contain valuable information about the inherent energy landscape. The advantage of FCS is given by the fact that in addition to temperature the external force can be varied in order to adjust Keq (fext ) to a prescribed value.\nTogether with the information that can be gathered from the analysis of rupture force\ndistributions[12], one obtains a very detailed view about the structure of the energy landscape underlying the observed unbinding/rebinding transition.\nWe now show that FCS also is a versatile tool to extract information about the energy landscape in the situation where the fluctuations cannot be considered as Markovian.\nHence, FCS can also be used to monitor the impact of environmental fluctuations or dynamic heterogeneities in the reaction under consideration. To this end we consider two\nmodels for dynamic disorder, namely a two-configuration exchange model (TCM) and a\n\n\f5\nmodel of gaussian environmental fluctuations (GM)[21]. In the TCM it is assumed that\nfor each state A and B there are two configurations (A, a), (A, b) and (B, a), (B, b). The\nexchange between configurations (X, a) and (X, b) takes place with a rate \u0393. In a realistic\ntreatment one would assume that \u0393 has a force-dependence that is different from that of the\nreaction rates. For simplicity, we neglect the force-dependency of \u0393 completely. The cor\u03b1\n\u03b1\nrexponding reaction rates are koff\n(fext ) for (A, \u03b1) \u2192 (B, \u03b1) and kon\n(fext ) for the rebinding\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\ntransition (\u03b1 = a, b). We assume that koff\n(fext ) = x\u03b1 koff (fext ) and kon\n(fext ) = x\u03b1 kon (fext )\n\nwhere koff (fext ) and kon (fext ) are the rates with the parameters given in Fig.1 and x\u03b1 are\nconstants. In the GM, one assumes a continuous environmental variable r(t) that undergoes a Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with (force-independent) damping rate \u03b3 and hr 2 i = \u03c3 2 .\nOne furthermore chooses koff (fext , r) = (r 2 /\u03c3 2 )koff (fext ), which allows an analytical treatment, cf. ref.[24]. In the context of SMF such gaussian models of dynamical disorder have\nbeen studied also including non-Markovian fluctuations[25]. The calculations of hN(t)i\nand Q(t) can be performed analytically[21] with the result that hN(t)i is not affected at all\nby environmental fluctuations in the long-time limit. For Q(t) the situation is completely\ndifferent. For finite \u0393 and \u03b3, one finds\nQ\u221e = Q(Markov)\n+X\n\u221e\n\nKeq (fext )\nKeq (fext ) + 1\n\n(7)\n\nwhere Q(Markov)\nis given by eq.(6) and one has\n\u221e\nXTCM =\n\n1 (xa \u2212 xb )2\nkoff (fext ) \u0393\u22121\n2 xa + xb\n!\n\n;\n\nXGM = (2koff (fext )) \u03b3 \u22121\n\n(8)\n\nThe important feature of eq.(7) is that for finite \u0393 (\u03b3) Q\u221e becomes positive! This is a\nclearcut indication of non-Markovian fluctuations since Q\u221e is always negative (or zero) for\nMarkovian fluctuations. It is evident, that only for \u0393 \u2192 \u221e (\u03b3 \u2192 \u221e), i.e. in the motional\nnarrowing regime, the Markovian limit is recovered. In the limit of static disorder, \u0393 \u2192 0\n(\u03b3 \u2192 0), Q(t) does not reach a limiting value in a finite time. Instead, Q(t) increases\nlinearly with time and can be written as Q(t) = X\u0302 t. The rate X\u02c6 is obtained from eq.(8) by\nreplacing \u0393 (\u03b3) with unity. Moreover, eq.(8) shows that Q(t) does not allow to discriminate\nbetween different scenarios. For the two models considered only the time scale on which\nthe limit is reached differs somewhat.\nIn Fig.3 we plot Q\u221e as a function of the external force for the GM. In order to show\nthat this result also is relevant for the interpretation of experimental data, we show in\nFig.4 how the positive limit is reached as a function of time. Again, for not too small \u03b3,\nQ\u221e is reached on the time scale of koff .\n\n\f6\nWe have scrutinized the results of typical FCS experiments performed on systems showing reversible bond breakage. The fluctuations in such systems can be analyzed in much the\nsame way as the photon counts in SMF. However, force spectroscopy allows to manipulate\nthe reaction rates and therefore one can obtain information about the energy landscape\nthat is not available from other single molecule techniques. Subtle features of the conformational dynamics displayed by reversibly bonded systems are revealed which allows to\nexpand the versatility of force spectroscopy in terms of fluctuation analysis. We have also\nshown that it should be possible to discriminate between Markovian and non-Markovian\nfluctuations by examining Mandel's Q-parameter - a parameter which is experimentally\naccessible. We expect that experiments analyzed along the way discussed in this work will\nyield valuable new information regarding the details of complex chemical reactions under\nexternal force.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nThis work has been supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft via SFB 625.\n\n[1] E.
