Turkish\nPhysics Community loses 6 brilliant members, participants of the Turkic Accelerator Complex\n(TAC) Project. All of us were shocked, but my personal tragedy was deeper, because I lose my\nbig sister Engin Ar\u0131k and my brother Engin Abat (one of the most promising young scientists\nin our field). Professor Engin Ar\u0131k was bannerbearer of the High Energy Physics in Turkey\nand, moreover, in Turkic World. Her dreams were: CERN membership for Turkey, TAC for\ndeveloping of Turkey and neighbor countries, sustainable development for Mankind ... Her\nscientific interests cover almost whole complex of HEP connected fields (see, for example\n[1]). Concerning the fourth SM family, an essential part of Turkish group activity (especially\nHiggs boson related topics) was initiated by Engin Ar\u0131k and performed by her students.\nI apologize that this paper is not sufficiently perfect to be worthy of memory of my\ncolleagues (I hope to finish extended version of the paper during this year).\n1. A little bit history\nParticle physics in 1930's: electron, photon, proton and neutron are discovered,\nneutrino and \u03c0-mesons are predicted by Pauli and Yukawa, respectively. EM interactions are\nmediated by photons, strong interactions are thought mediated by \u03c0-mesons and weak\ninteractions are described through four-fermion contact interaction as proposed by Fermi.\nThere is a \"simple\" classification of matter fields: leptons (e and \u03bd), mesons (\u03c0\u00b1 and \u03c00),\nbarions (p and n). Whole (visible) Universe is formed from a few particles: nuclei are bound\nstates of p's and n's, atoms are bound states of nuclei and e's etc. Chemistry became the\nScience... Whole technology of 20th century is based on this picture.\nThis nice picture was destroyed in 1937 by the discovery of \u03bc! We were looked for\n\u03c0\u2013mesons but found something different. This new particle seems to be produced by strong\ninteractions, but interacts with matter by EM interactions. Real \u03c0\u2013mesons were discovered 10\n\n\fyears later in emulsion experiments... We fall with \u03bc\u2013e puzzle: why the Nature needs the\nsecond \"heavy\" electron ...\n1960's: hadron (meson and barion) inflation leads to the Quark Model.\n1970's: G\u0130M \u21d2 c-quark (also from q-l symmetry as the counterpart of \u03bd\u03bc). Modified\n\u03bc\u2013e puzzle: why the Nature needs 2 families. Experiment: charmed hadrons + \u03c4-lepton +\nbeauty. Theory: CKM \u21d2 3 families (CP phase, BAU).\n1990's: Experiment: t-quark, mH > 114 GeV. Theory: fourth SM family revisited (and\na lot of different BSM models proposed during last decades).\nLet me continue with an introductory paragraph from 10 years old paper [2]: \"It is\nknown, that the Standard Model with three fermion families well describes almost all of the\nlarge amount of particle physics phenomena. Today, SM is proved at the level of first-order\nradiative corrections for energies up to 100 GeV. However, there are a number of\nfundamental problems which do not have solutions in the framework of the SM: quark-lepton\nsymmetry and fermion's mass and mixing pattern, family replication and number of families,\nL-R symmetry breaking, electroweak scale etc. Then, SM contains unacceptably large number\nof arbitrary parameters even in three family case: 19 in the absence of right neutrinos (and\nMajorana mass terms for left neutrinos), 26 if neutrinos are Dirac particles, > 30 if neutrinos\nare Majorana particles. Moreover, the number of \"elementary particles\", which is equal to 37\nin three families case (18 quarks, 6 leptons, 12 gauge bosons and 1 Higgs boson), reminds the\nMendeleyev Table. Three decades ago similar situation led to the quark model!\"\nFlavor Democracy hypothesis provides an opportunity to solve some of mentioned\nproblems and predicts the fourth SM family (see review [3] and references therein). The\nfourth family matters were discussed in deep during the topical workshop [4] held in\nSeptember 2008 at CERN (see [5] for resume of the workshop).\n2. Why the Four SM Families?\nThere are two possible answers to this question. The first one is \"Why not?\" Indeed,\nlower bound on the number of families comes from LEP data (N \u2265 3), and upper bound is 8\nfrom asymptotic freedom. The second answer (preferred by our group) is: existence of the\nfourth SM family follows from the SM basics and phenomenology (Flavor Democracy).\nThere were two (incorrect/wrong) objections: incorrect interpretation of LEP1 data\nand wrong interpretation of EW precision data. Concerning the first one: only the number of\n\"active\" (in SM LH \u03bd), \"massless\" neutrinos (with 2m < mZ) is equal to 3. In some sense it is\nthe consequence of the historical \"paralogism\" (V-A \u2192 \u03bd \u2261 \u03bdL), but according the SM (q-l\nsymmetry) RH \u03bd should exist, because it is the partner of RH up-quark. Concerning the\nsecond one, namely \"A 4th generation of ordinary fermions is excluded to 99.999% CL on the\nbasis of S parameter alone\" (see, e g PDG 2006), the clearest answer, namely, \"This\nconclusion is wrong.\" was given by G. Kribbs in August 2007 at CERN seminar (see, also,\n[6-8]).\nThe clear arguments for fourth SM family are given in original papers [9-11] and\nreviews [2, 3, 12]. In the case of entire democracy the (Dirac) masses of the fourth SM family\nfermions are almost degenerate with common value between 300 GeV and 700 GeV, whereas\nall known fermions are massless. Fermions from first three generations acquire masses as a\nresult of slight violation of full democracy. A number of parameterizations of slightly broken\nDemocratic Mass Matrix, which give opportunity to obtain both mass and mixing patterns\nwith a fewer number of parameters are proposed [13-15]. Last parameterization, which gives\ncorrect values for fundamental fermion masses, at the same time, predicts quark and lepton\nCKM matrices in good agreement with experimental data.\n\n\fFlavor Democracy essentially reduces the number of free parameters, which is equal to\n26 in SM3 and 40 in SM4 for the Dirac neutrino case. For example, with parameterization\n[15] last number fall from 40 to 25. My personal feeling: Dirac masses of the fourth SM\nfamily fermions are almost equal with preferable value 450 GeV (500-550 for the pole mass),\nwhich corresponds to common (for all fundamental fermions) Yukawa coupling equal to\nSU(2) gauge coupling gW; u4 a little bit lighter than d4, while \u03bd4 could be essentially lighter\nthan l4 due to Majorana mass terms for right-handed components of neutrinos. It is interest,\nthat if the quartic coupling constant of the Higgs self-interaction is also equal to gW, the Higgs\nboson mass is predicted to be around 300 GeV.\nArguments Against the Fifth SM Family: The first argument disfavoring the fifth SM\nfamily is the large value of mt \u2248 175 GeV. Indeed, partial-wave unitarity leads to mQ \u2264 700\nGeV \u2248 4mt and in general we expect mt << m4 << m5. Then, neutrino counting at LEP results\nin fact that there are only three \"light\" (2m\u03bd < mZ) non-sterile neutrinos, whereas in the case\nof five SM families four \"light\" neutrinos are expected. Finally, the fifth family is excluded at\nmore than 5\u03c3 level by precision electroweak data.\nBelow I give some remarks on search for fourth SM family including several new\nresults obtained since 2006 (mainly by Turkish group). For more adequate picture see [4, 5].\n3. The Fourth SM Family at Tevatron/LHC\nHadron colliders are best place for discovery of new quarks. Together with direct\nproduction, fourth family quarks will manifest themselves due to an essential enhancement of\nthe Higgs boson production via gluon fusion.\n3.1. Direct Search\nThe fourth SM family quarks will be copiously produced at the LHC via gluon-gluon\nfusion (see [16] and references therein). The expected cross section is about 10 (0.25) pb for a\nquark mass of 400 (800) GeV. The fourth generation up-type quark, u4, would predominantly\ndecay via u4\u2192Wb, therefore, the expected event topologies are similar to those for t-quark\npair production. The best channel for observing will be [17]:\ngg \u2192 u 4 u 4 \u2192 WWb b \u2192 (l\u03bd )(JJ )b b\n\nwhere one W decays leptonically and the other hadronically. The mass resolution is estimated\nto be 20 (40) GeV for mu4 = 300 (700) GeV. The small interfamily mixings [14, 15] lead to\nthe formation of the fourth family quarkonia [16, 18]. The most promising candidate for the\nLHC is the pseudo-scalar quarkonium state, \u03b74, which will be produced resonantly via gluongluon fusion. Especially, the decay channel \u03b74\u2192ZH is the matter of interest [19].\nIf the fourth generation quarks prefer to mix with the first two generations, the signal\nis doubled because u4 and d4 are indistinguishable (mass difference is less than 50 GeV). In\nthis case 500 GeV fourth family quarks can be discovered at the LHC with 400 pb-1 data [20].\nIf \u03bd4 has Majorana nature, for definite values of \u03bd4 and Higgs boson masses double\ndiscovery of both of them can be possible at the LHC with a few fb-1 data [21].\nThe FNAL Tevatron Run II can observe u4 and d4 quarks if there is an anomalous\ninteraction with enough strength between the fourth family quarks and known quarks [22].\nRecent CDF data on the search for \"heavy top\" [23] could be interpreted as a hint for fourth\nfamily quarks [24].\n3.2. Higgs Boson\n\n\fThe fourth SM family leads to an essential increase (~8 times) of the Higgs boson\nproduction cross-section at hadron colliders and this can give the Tevatron experiments (CDF\nand D0) opportunity to discover the Higgs boson before the LHC, if its mass is between 140\nand 200 GeV (see [25] and ref's therein). Both D0 and CDF Collaborations are looking for\nthis opportunity [26, 27]. Already in 2006, their results were placing constraints on the SM\nwith four or more fermion families [28]. Recently, CDF and D0 combined results exclude the\nHiggs mass between 160 and 170 GeV for the SM3 [29]. For the SM4 the same results\nexclude the region approximately between 130 and 220 GeV (approximately, because in the\nanalysis other channels are added to the main/dominate one, namely, gg\u2192H\u2192WW, and\nregion above 200 GeV is not covered).\nConcerning the LHC, it will be able to cover the whole region via the golden mode\nH \u2192 ZZ \u2192 llll and detect the Higgs signal during the first year of operation if the fourth SM\nfamily exists [30-33].\n4. The Fourth SM Family at ILC/CLIC and QCD-E/LHeC\nThe fourth family leptons will clearly manifest themselves at the future lepton and\nphoton colliders [15, 34, 35]. Also, the number of different fourth family quarkonium states\ncan be produced resonantly at lepton and photon machines. Moreover, in difference from the\nLHC, states formed by up and down type quarks can be investigated separately even if their\nmass difference is small.\nConcerning future ep and \u03b3p colliders, they have promising potential for search\npossible anomalous interactions of both fourth family leptons and quarks [36-38].\nEpilogue\n16 Mart 2009: Turkey sent official letter to the CERN Council in order to start the\nmembership procedure.\nAcknowledgements: I am grateful to Serkant Ali \u00c7ET\u0130N and G\u00f6khan \u00dcNEL for intangible\nsupport, as well as to all my colleagues/friends for fruitful collaboration.\nREFERENCES\n[1] E.
