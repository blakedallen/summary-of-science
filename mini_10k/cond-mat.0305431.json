As a basic principle, the\nweak interaction is considered as the only fundamental interaction, which does not respect\nleft-right symmetry. Atoms are chiral due to the parity-violating weak neutral current\ninteraction between the nucleus and the electrons [1]. As an example of chirality (helicity) in\natomic phenomena, one can consider the anapole-moment properties. The anapole moment is\nspin dependent. It takes place in systems with the parity violation and with the annual\nmagnetic field [2]. The anapole moment plays the essential role in nuclear helimagnetism\n[3,4]. It was considered as an intrinsic property of a diatomic polar molecule [5].\nThe problems of fundamental discrete symmetries constitute, in particular, the subject of\nstrong discussions in the field of the magnetoelectric (ME) effect and chiral (optically active)\nmedia. Recently, the notion of the anapole was used for explanation of the ME effect in solidstate magnetic crystals [6]. The nature of the atomic chirality, however, is not the same as the\nchirality of enantiomers. Chiral molecules (being the delocalized structures) have a welldefined form and so they must be in one of the configurations. It has been made many\ntheoretical predictions that enantiomers of chiral molecules have different spectra because of\nparity violation associated with neutral currents in the weak interaction [7] or with the\nparticle-antiparticle replacement in different enantiomers [8]. Many spectroscopic proposals\nhave been made to observe a parity violation effect in molecules (see e.g. [9]). However,\nconsidering the weakness of the effects, it is broadly admitted that the weak interaction may\nbe neglected in molecular physics and even more clearly in chemistry and biology. Moreover,\nin a quantum mechanical description of optical activity, the remaining questions are: \"Can the\nexistence of chiral molecules be explained in quantum mechanics? Why the chiral molecules\nare non-stable and never found in energy eigenstates?\" [10,11].\n\n2\n\n\fIt becomes clear now that the P, T, C symmetries should be also one of the central\nquestions in physics of novel artificial materials, in particular, chiral and bianisotropic\ncomposite materials. In consideration of physical properties of structural elements of such\nmaterials \u2013 artificial atoms \u2013 one should use the quantum-mechanical-like description [12]. At\npresent, there is a strong interest in different quantum phenomena on a macroscopic scale. For\nexample, \"macroscopic\" flux quantization, \"macroscopic\" quantum tunneling and resonance\ntunneling, macroscopic quantum effects in Josephson-junction circuits \u2013 all these effects\nconstitute a subject of extensive and intensive fundamental research and also a subject of\nconceivable applications of quantum-state engineering (see e.g. [13] and references therein).\nAnother aspects of \"macroscopic\" quantum phenomena \u2013 a probability amplitude theory in\nthe classical macrodomain of the dynamics of charged particles in a magnetic field \u2013 were\nconsidered in [14].\nIn microwaves, ferrite resonators with multi-resonance MS-wave oscillations may have\nsizes two-four orders less than the free-space EM wavelength at the same frequency [15].\nThese \"microscopic\" oscillating objects \u2013 the particles \u2013 may interact with the external EM\nfields by a very specific way, forbidden for the classical description. To describe such\ninteractions, the quantum mechanical analysis should be used. One of examples of the\nquantum-mechanical-like effects in small ferrite resonators is the ME effect. Recent\nexperimental results demonstrate the ME effect in normally magnetized MS-wave flat ferrite\nresonators with surface electrodes [16-19]. Among different types of ferrite ME particles\nexamined in [16-19] one should, certainly, distinguish the structures based on ferrite disks\nwith linear (one-dimensional) surface electrodes. In this case, the spectrums excited by\n\nr r\ndifferent types of RF fields (the E , H fields or their combinations) have the same positions of\nthe main oscillation peaks. Because of these spectral properties one can talk about the unified\nprocess of ME oscillations. This fact makes possible to characterize a disk + wire - type\n\n3\n\n\fferrite ME particle by a set of parameters and represent it as a \"point source\" with the locally\ncoupled two (electric and magnetic) dipole moments. These ferrite particles provide the P, T,\nC symmetry characteristics distinguished from those produced by point sources of the EM\nfields [20,21].\nIt becomes clear that the main physics of the effective quasielectrostatic to\nquasimagnetostatic energy transformation (and vice versa) in ferrite ME particles and the\nsymmetry properties of ME fields originated by these particles, observed in [16-19], should be\nfound from the spectral properties of MS oscillations in normally magnetized disk ferrite\nresonators. So, initially, we have to focus our attention to a \"pure\" (without a metal electrode)\nferrite resonator. MS oscillations in a small ferrite disk resonator could be characterized by a\ndiscrete spectrum of energy levels [22]. Calculations of the energy spectra of MS oscillations\nin ferrite disks were made in [23]. In paper [24] we consider surface magnetic currents, which\ncharacterize oscillations MS in a normally magnetized ferrite disk and give parity-violating\nperturbations. As we discuss in the present paper, because of such magnetic currents, one has\nthe parity-odd, time-reversal-even motion processes having a clear analogy with the anapolemoment characteristics in the weak interaction.\nRecent experiments show that MS oscillations in a normally magnetized ferrite disk are\nstrongly affected by a normal component of the external RF electric field [25]. The observed\nmulti-resonance process cannot be characterized as the induced electric polarization effect in\na particle. There are the eigen-electric-moment oscillations caused by the motion processes in\na ferrite resonator. Since the RF electric field does not change sign under time inversion, the\neigen electric moment should also be characterized by the time-reversal-even properties. This\nis the case of an anapole moment, considered, for the first time, by Zel'dovich [2].\n\n4\n\n\fCircular surface magnetic currents in MS-wave ferrite disks. \u2013 MS-wave oscillations in a\nferrite sample occupy an intermediate place between the \"pure\" electromagnetic and spinwave (exchange) processes. For the characteristic specimen size l , MS-wave oscillations\ntake place when\n\n\u03b1 << l << c \u03c9 ,\nwhere\n\n(1)\n\n\u03b1 is the characteristic length of the exchange energy [26]. Relation (1) means that\n\nwe neglect all the electromagnetic effects (the effects connected with a finite velocity of\npropagation of electromagnetic perturbations) and, at the same time, all the exchange\nprocesses (the effects connected with spatial dispersion in ferrites). The energy density of\nMS-wave oscillations is not the electromagnetic-wave density of energy and not the exchange\nenergy density as well. MS waves and oscillations in ferrites are described based on the\nWalker equation \u2013 the second-order differential equation written for MS potential\nr\n\n\u03c8 ( H = \u2212\u2207\u03c8 ) . In an unbounded ferrite, MS waves at the oscillating frequencies have any\nwavelength. The frequency degeneracy is removed by considering the effects of finite sample\nboundaries. It is supposed that the boundary conditions are that the tangential component of\nr\nr\nH and the normal component of B should be continuous across the boundary of the\n\nspecimen [15].\nIn a normally magnetized ferrite-disk resonator with a small thickness h to diameter 2 R\nratio, the monochromatic MS-wave potential function \u03c8 is represented as [22]:\n~\n\n\u03c8 = \u2211 A pq \u03be pq ( z )\u03c6~q ( \u03c1 , \u03b1 ) ,\n\n(2)\n\np ,q\n\nwhere Apq\n\n~\nis a MS mode amplitude, \u03be pq ( z ) and \u03c6~q ( \u03c1 , \u03b1 ) are dimensionless functions\n\ndescribing, respectively, \"thickness\" (z coordinate) and \"in-plane\", or \"flat\" (radial \u03c1 and\nazimuth \u03b1 coordinates) MS modes. In a ferrite disk with a small thickness to diameter ratio,\n\n5\n\n\fthe spectrum of \"thickness\" modes is enough \"rare\" compared to the \"dense\" spectrum of\n\"flat\" modes [17,22,23].\nBased on the Walker equation, one has for every \"flat\" MS mode:\n\nG\u02c6 \u22a5\u03c6~q = \u03b2 q2\u03c6~q ,\n\n(3)\n\nG\u02c6 \u22a5 \u2261 \u03bc\u2207 2\u22a5 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere\n\n\u2207 2\u22a5 is the two-dimensional, \"in-plane\", Laplace operator and \u03b2 q is the propagation constant\nalong z-axis, \u03bc is the diagonal component of the permeability tensor. For propagating MS\nmodes, operator \u011c\u22a5 is the positive definite operator. Since a two-dimensional (\"in-plane\")\ndifferential operator \u011c\u22a5 contains \u2207 2\u22a5 (the two-dimensional, \"in-plane\", Laplace operator), a\ndouble integration by parts (the Green theorem) on S \u2013 a square of an \"in-plane\" cross\nsection of an open ferrite disk \u2013 of the integral\n\n~ ~ \u2217 dS , gives the following boundary\n\n\u222b (G\u02c6 \u03c6 )\u03c6\n\u22a5\n\ncondition for the energy orthonormality:\n\uf8eb \u2202\u03c6~ \uf8f6\n\uf8eb \u2202\u03c6~ \uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\u2212 \uf8ec\uf8ec\n=0\n\uf8ed \u2202\u03c1 \uf8f8 \u03c1 = R \u2212 \uf8ed \u2202\u03c1 \uf8f8 \u03c1 = R +\n\n(5)\n\n\u03bc (H \u03c1 ) \u03c1 =R \u2212 (H \u03c1 ) \u03c1 =R = 0 ,\n\n(6)\n\n\u03bc \uf8ec\uf8ec\nor\n\n\u2212\n\nwhere H \u03c1 = \u2212\n\n+\n\n\u2202\u03c8\nis a radial component of the RF magnetic field, R \u2212 and R + designate,\n\u2202\u03c1\n\nrespectively, the inner (ferrite) and outer (dielectric) regions of a disk resonator with radius R.\nFor operator \u011c\u22a5 , the boundary condition of the MS-potential continuity together with\nboundary condition (5) [or (6)] are the so-called essential boundary conditions [27]. When\nsuch boundary conditions are used, the MS-potential eigen functions of operator \u011c\u22a5 form a\ncomplete basis in an energy functional space, and the functional describing an average\n6\n\n\fquantity of energy, has a minimum at the energy eigenfunctions [27]. The essential boundary\nconditions differ from the homogeneous electrodynamics boundary conditions at \u03c1 = R ,\nwhich demand continuity for the radial component of the magnetic flux density (together with\ncontinuity for potential \u03c6~ ). The last ones are called as natural boundary conditions [27]. In\n[23], calculations of complete-set energy spectra of MS oscillations in a ferrite disk resonator\nwere made based on the essential boundary conditions.\nIn a cylindrical coordinate system, continuity for a radial component of the magnetic flux\ndensity (the natural boundary condition) at \u03c1 = R is described as\n\n\u03bc ( H \u03c1 ) \u03c1 = R \u2212 ( H \u03c1 ) \u03c1 = R = \u2212i \u03bc a ( H \u03b1 ) \u03c1 = R\n\u2212\n\nwhere H \u03b1 = \u2212\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n(7)\n\n1 \u2202\u03c8\nis an azimuth component of the RF magnetic field, \u03bc a is the off\u03c1 \u2202\u03b1\n\ndiagonal component of the permeability tensor. Supposing that \u03c6~ \u223c e \u2212i\u03bd\u03b1 , one can rewrite (7)\nas\n\n\u03bc\n\uf8eb \u2202\u03c6~ \uf8f6\n\uf8eb \u2202\u03c6~ \uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\u2212 \uf8ec\uf8ec\n= \u2212 a \u03bd (\u03c6~ )\u03c1 = R \u2212 .\nR\n\uf8ed \u2202\u03c1 \uf8f8 \u03c1 = R \u2212 \uf8ed \u2202\u03c1 \uf8f8 \u03c1 = R +\n\n\u03bc \uf8ec\uf8ec\n\n(8)\n\nOne can see that \"in-plane\" functions \u03c6~ , being determined by two second-order differential\nequations (the Bessel equations for functions \u03c6~ inside and outside the ferrite) and one firstorder differential equation (8), are dependent on both a quantity and a sign of \u03bd . So the\nfunctions \u03c6~ cannot be the single-valued functions for angle \u03b1 varying from 0 to 2\u03c0 . In\nother words, we have different results for positive and negative directions of an angle\ncoordinate when 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 2\u03c0 .\nr\nLet us consider a circulation of vector H along a circular contour L = 2\u03c0R . Since on the\ncontour L, H \u03b1( L ) = \u2212\n\n2\u03c0\n1 \u2202\u03c6~ ( L )\n, we can write this circulation as C = \u03bd \u222b \u03c6~ ( L ) d\u03b1 . The circulation\nR \u2202\u03b1\n0\n\nC should be equal to zero for a single-valued function \u03c6~ . This fact also follows from the MS\n7\n\n\fr\ndescription ( \u2207 \u00d7 H = 0 ). Our analysis shows, however, that this circulation has a non-zero\n\nquantity. The solution depends on both a modulus and a sign of \u03bd . We have a sequence of\nangular eigenvalues restricted from above and below by values equal in a modulus and\ndifferent in a sign, which we denote as \u00b1 s e . The difference 2 s e between the largest and\nsmallest values is an integer or zero. So s e can have values 0, \u00b1 1 2 , \u00b1 1, \u00b1 3 2 ,...,\u03bd 2 . At a\nfull-angle \"in-plane\" rotation (at an angle equal to 2 \u03c0 ) of a system of coordinates, the \"inplane\" functions \u03c6~ with integer values s e return to their initial states (single-valued\nfunctions) and \"in-plane\" functions \u03c6~ with the half-integer values s e will have an opposite\nsign (double-valued functions). The only possibility in our case is to suggest that s e are the\nhalf-integer quantities. Because of the double-valuedness properties of MS-potential functions\non a lateral surface of a ferrite disk resonator, we can talk about the \"spinning-type rotation\"\nalong a border contour L [24]. Along with the well-known notion of the \"magnetic spin\" as a\nquantity correlated with the eigen magnetic moment of a particle, we introduced in [24] the\nnotion of the \"electric spin\" as a quantity correlated with the eigen electric moment. For\ninteger quantities s e the eigen electric moment is equal to zero, but it is non-zero for halfinteger values s e . From the above consideration it becomes clear that superscript e in s e\nmeans \"electric\".\nThe main feature of boundary condition\n\n(7) arises from the quantity of an azimuth\n\nmagnetic field in the right-hand side. One can see that this is a singular field, which exists\nonly in an infinitesimally narrow cylindrical layer abutting (from a ferrite side), to the ferritedielectric border. One does not have any special conditions connecting radial and azimuth\ncomponents of magnetic fields on other (inner or outer) circular contours, except contour L.\nBecause of the annual magnetic field, arising from boundary condition (7), the notion of an\neffective circular magnetic current can be considered.\n\n8\n\n\fLet us formally introduce a quantity of a magnetic current:\nr\nrm\n1\nj ( z) \u2261\ni\u03c9\u03bc a H \u03b1 ( z )\n4\u03c0\n\n(9)\n\nWe can rewrite the boundary condition (7) as follows:\n\n1\n\uf8ee 1\n\uf8f9\n\u03c9\u03bc ( H \u03c1 ) \u03c1 = R \u2212 \u2212 \u03c9 ( H \u03c1 ) \u03c1 = R + \uf8fa = \u2212i m\n4\u03c0\n\uf8f0 4\u03c0\n\uf8fb\n\n\u03b4 ( \u03c1 \u2212 R)\uf8ef\n\n(10)\n\nwhere i m is a density of an effective boundary magnetic current defined as\ni m ( z ) \u2261 \u03b4 ( \u03c1 \u2212 R)\n\nr\nr\n1\ni\u03c9\u03bc a ( H \u03b1 ( z )) \u03c1 = R \u2212 = \u03b4 ( \u03c1 \u2212 R) j m ( z )\n4\u03c0\n\n(11)\n\nIn a supposition that \"flat\" functions \u03c6~ form a complete basis in the energy functional space\nwith use of boundary condition (5) [or (6)], it becomes evident that the effective boundary\nmagnetic current slips from the main properties of this functional space. This current cannot\nbe considered as a single-valued function. In the description of the MS-potential functions in a\nferrite disk, taking into account the effective surface magnetic current, certain additional\ncoordinates should be used. It means that additional eigenvalues and eigenfunctions should\nappear on boundary contour L. One can see that for modes with zero azimuth variations\n(\u03bd = 0 ), both the essential and natural boundary conditions are the same, being described by\nEqn. (5) [or (6)]. In this case, the effective boundary magnetic current is equal to zero.\nThe matrices characterizing the components of the \"electric spin\" we represent as:\n\uf8eb0\ns\u02c6+e = \uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed1\n\n0\uf8f6\n\uf8f7,\n0 \uf8f7\uf8f8\n\n\uf8eb0\ns\u02c6\u2212e = \uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed0\n\n1\uf8f6\n\uf8f7,\n0 \uf8f7\uf8f8\n\n\uf8eb1 0 \uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7 .\ns\u02c6 ze = w \uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed 0 \u2212 1\uf8f8\n\n(12)\n\nQuantity w characterizes the \"spin coordinates\". To distinguish the \"right\" and \"left\" MSpotential functions at a full-angle \"in-plane\" rotation (at an angle equal to 2 \u03c0 ) of a system of\ncoordinates, we should write that w = k\n\n1\n, where k is an integer odd (positive or negative)\n2\n\nquantity. One should suppose that to have the system stability, the \"spin states\",\n\n9\n\n\fcharacterizing by quantities w, ought to be in a certain synchronism with the \"orbit states\",\ncharacterizing by quantities \u03bd .\n~\nWe consider now the \"border\" MS-potential \"flat\" functions \u03c6~ on contour L. There are\nsingular functions describing the \"spin states\". For k-th \"border\" eigenfunction we can write\n~\n\n\u03c6~k = Bk e \u2212iw \u03b1 ,\n\n(13)\n\nk\n\n~\nwhere Bk is an amplitude coefficient. Introducing function \u03c6~ , we have to note that this is not\nan independent function with respect to function \u03c6~ , but the function showing certain\nadditional properties, additional states of the MS-potential scalar wave function. For a certain\n\"thickness\" mode and a certain \"flat\" mode we can represent the \u03b1 -component of the\n\"border\" (singular) magnetic field as\n\n( H \u03b1 ( z )) \u03c1 = R\n\n~\n~\n1 \u2202\u03c6~\n~\n~\n= \u2212 A\u03be ( z )\u2207 \u03b1 \u03c6 = \u2212 A\u03be ( z )\nR \u2202\u03b1\n~\n\n\u2212\n\n.\n\n(14)\n\n\u03c1 =R\u2212\n\nFor a circular effective boundary magnetic current we have now [see Expr. (11)]:\n\n(i\n\nm\n\n~\n~ i\u03c9\u03bc a \u2202\u03c6~\n( z ) )k = \u2212 A\u03be ( z )\n4\u03c0R \u2202\u03b1\n\n\u03c1 =R\n\n\u2212\n\n~ \u03c9\u03bc\n= \u2212 A\u03be ( z ) a wk Bk e \u2212iwk\u03b1\n4\u03c0R\n\n(15)\n\nThe circular surface magnetic current does not exist due to only precession of magnetization.\nIt appears because of the combined effect of precession in a ferrite material and \"spinning\nrotation\" caused by the special-type boundary conditions. The \"border\" MS-potential\n~\nfunctions \u03c6~ , being characterized by the \"spin coordinates\", are antisymmetrical functions. At\nthe same time, as it follows from Expr. (15), the effective magnetic currents are described by\nsymmetrical functions with respect to the \"spin coordinates\". In other words, the effective\nmagnetic current has the same direction for the \"right\" and \"left\" spinning states. The signs of\nmagnetic current i m are different for different signs of \u03bc a . However, the \"positive\" ( \u03bc a > 0 )\n\n10\n\n\fand \"negative\" ( \u03bc a < 0 ) magnetic currents do not mutually compensate each other since for\ndifferent signs of \u03bc a we have structures with different symmetries.\nCirculation of current i m along contour L gives a nonzero quantity when wk is a number\ndivisible by\n\n1\n:\n2\n2\u03c0\n\n~ \u03c9\u03bc\nDk ( z ) = \u222b (i m ) k dl = R \u222b (i m ) k d\u03b1 = iA\u03be ( z ) a Bk .\n2\u03c0\n0\nL\n\n(16)\n\nSince circulation Dk (z ) is a non-zero quantity, one can define an electric moment of a whole\nferrite disk resonator (in a region far away from a disk) as\na ke = \u2212i\n\nh\nh\n\u03c9\u03bc a\nr rm r\n1\n~\ndz\n(\n\u03c1\n\u00d7\ni\n)\n\u22c5\ne\ndl\n=\nA\nRB\nz\nk \u222b \u03be ( z ) dz ,\n\u222b\n\u222b\n2c 0 L = 2\u03c0R\n4\u03c0c\n0\n\n(17)\n\nThe off-diagonal component of the permeability tensor, \u03bc a , can be correlated with a magnetic\nvector of gyration [15]:\n\n\u03bca r\nr\ngm =\nez ,\n4\u03c0\n\n(18)\n\nr\nwhere e z is the unit vector along z-axis. A sign of g m corresponds to a sign of \u03bc a . A sign of\n\nr r\nr\namplitude B depends on orientation of vector s e ( s e = s e e z ) with respect to z-axis. So one\n\nr r\nr r\ncan distinguish two cases: s e \u22c5 g m > 0 and s e \u22c5 g m < 0 .\nThe property of helicity is well-known in elementary particle physics. There is no left-right\nsymmetry since spin orientation is not separated from orientation of a linear momentum.\nFollowing discussions in paper [2], one can see that in such a case a particle cannot be\nr\naffected by the electric field. In our case, the spin orientation s e is not separated from\n\nr\nr\norientation of a linear momentum a e , but taking into account also orientation of vector g m .\nr r\nr r\nFigs. 1 (a) and (b) show two possible situations for cases s e \u22c5 g m > 0 and s e \u22c5 g m < 0 . In both\n\n11\n\n\fcases, a sign of an electric moment a e is invariant with respect to the time reversal (both\n\nr\nr\nvectors s e and g m are the axial vectors). This fact is illustrated in Figs. 1 (c) and (d). Our\nr\nanalysis gives an evidence for the anapole-moment properties of vector a e . It is necessary to\nr\nr\nnote that together with the pictures of two-vector (vectors s e and g m ) orientations with\nr\nrespect to orientation of a bias magnetic field H 0 shown in Figs. 1 (a), (b), another two\n\npictures can be demonstrated. So, in a general case, the analysis should be expanded with\nconsideration of four possible cases.\nFollowing Zel'dovich [2], the so-called toroidal (or anapole) moment is an odd parity\nmagnetic field distribution of rank 1 (dipole). One can trace a clear analogy between the\nabove consideration and electromagnetic properties of a toroidal solenoid. If we picture an\nelement of magnetic current i m as a small electric-current loop, the combination of all\nelements along contour L can be viewed (for a ferrite disk with a small thickness to diameter\nratio) as a toroidal current winding producing an anapole moment. A similar situation, when\nthe magnetization current is entirely responsible for the anapole moment, one can find in [3].\nNow the question about a nature of a source of magnetic current i m arises. As we discussed\nin [24], with consideration of non-zero circulation along contour L we refer, in fact, to the\nconcept of non-integrable, i.e. path-dependent, phase factor defined by an integral taken\naround an unshrincable loop. Since the difference between \u03bd and w is a non-integer quantity,\none has the electric field described by a non-single-valued function with respect to a frame of\n~\nreference of the \"spinning coordinates\" (determining function \u03c6~ ). This leads to existence of\nan electric flux \u03a6 E through the \"surface ring\" opening. Our situation becomes resembling\n(and dual) to the case of a mesoscopic metal ring threaded by a magnetic flux when the flux\nchanges with time [28]. Based on this analogy one can say that in our case, a persistent ring\n\n12\n\n\fmagnetic current is due to the magnetomotive force expressed as a Maxwell-law generator as\nfollows:\n\n\u03b5 m (t ) =\n\nd\u03a6 E\ndt\n\n(19)\n\nThis quantity defines amplitude Bk .\n\nHelical surface magnetic currents in MS-wave ferrite disks. \u2013 In the above model we made\nuse of a cylindrical coordinate system. In this case we had to introduce the notion of \"spinning\nrotation\", which arises from the necessity to utilize the double-valued MS-potential functions\non a border contour L. The question, however, is still open: What is the reason of apearence\nof such double-valued functions? The answer can be found from the fact that we considered\nrotation separately from an axial motion. In other words, the above consideration was based\non an assumption that surface magnetic currents in all the elementary rings (having\nelementary thickness dz) are in phase. In this assumption we were able to define the anapole\nmoment by integration over z [see Expr. (17)].\nOur analysis suggests an idea that in another coordinate system \u2013 the helical coordinate\nsystem \u2013 the picture could be different from the above representation. One can suppose that in\na case of helical surface magnetic currents (which we have in a helical coordinate system) the\nanapole moment will arise not from the property of \"spinning rotation\", but from the\ncombined boundary effect on contour L and planes z = 0 and z = h of a ferrite disk. To\nillustrate this statement let us examine distributions of helical surface magnetic currents for\npossible manifestation of the anapole-moment properties.\nSince helical surface magnetic current i m takes place due to a combined effect of a circular\nand axial motion processes, the upper ( z = h ) and lower ( z = 0 ) points should be the turn\npoints. So the current circumscribes a bifilar helix. As far as we have a distributed-parameter-\n\n13\n\n\fsystem, the surface current is described by the standing-wave characteristics. It means that\nthere are knots and maximums in the current distributions. Two alternatives can be traced in\nthis model: (A) current i m has a maximum amplitude in the turn points, and (B) current i m is\nequal to zero in the upper ( z = h ) and lower ( z = 0 ) points. For a possible manifestation of\nthe anapole-moment properties, the case (A) does not represent any interest, but the case (B)\ndoes. When current i m is equal to zero in the upper ( z = h ) and lower ( z = 0 ) points, it\nchanges its sign (both with respect to azimuth and axial coordinates) in these points. It means\nthat in the turn points the left-handed helix is transformed to the right-handed helix and vice\nversa.\nSuppose that we have the helical magnetic current distribution corresponding to case (B).\n\nr\nLet vector p be unit vector along z-axis, showing direction of an axial motion. Suppose that\nr\nr r\nan axial motion is along vector g m . So we have p \u22c5 g m > 0 . Assume that for the \"up\" axial\nmotion (the motion along z-axis) we have a certain direction of helical current i m , which\nr\ncorresponds to a right-handed helix (Fig. 2 (a)). The case when vector g m is anti-parallel to\n\nr r r\nvector p ( p \u22c5 g m < 0 ) is not identical to the considered above. An example of the \"up\" axial\nr\nmotion along vector \u2212 g m with current i m circumscribing a left-handed helix is shown in Fig.\n\nr\n2 (b). Now let us perform the time reversal operation. Since g m is an axial vector, it has an\nopposite direction with respect to z-axis, when the time reversal operation is made. Because\n\nr\nr\nof correlation between directions of vectors p and g m (due to the Onsager principle), an\nopposite sign of g m means the \"down\" axial motion (the motion along \u2212 z axis). With the\nmotion \"down\" we also have helical surface currents but with an opposite direction (see Figs.\n2 (c) and (d)). In both cases (Fig. 2 (c) versus Fig. 2 (a) and Fig. 2 (d) versus Fig. 2 (b)) there\nare the same directions of anapole moments, produced by helical surface magnetic currents.\nSo the time-reversal symmetry does not forbid the manifestation of the anapole-moment\n\n14\n\n\fproperties. It is interesting to note that following the above picture of representation of an\nelement of magnetic current i m as a small electric-current loop, the combination of all\nelements along a helix can be viewed as a helical-form (not toroidal) \"doughnut\" current\nwinding. One has also to take into account that together with the surface magnetic current\ndistribution, the above model should describe the magnetic charge density distribution as\nwell. For a case when current i m is equal to zero in the turn points, the continuity equation\ngives maximums of the magnetic charge density in these points.\nIn a helical coordinate system the azimuth number does not necessarily have to be an\ninteger as it would in a standard cylindrical system [29]. One can suppose that in our case of a\nflat ferrite disk the azimuth number might be as a half integer quantity. So the model of a\nhelical magnetic current can be properly reduced to the model of a circular magnetic current\nwith a clear explanation why the \"spinning rotation\" on boundary contour L takes place. To\nfind a helical surface magnetic current, one has to rewrite the boundary conditions (7) and (8)\nin the so-called helical coordinate system [29]. Unlike the cylindrical coordinate system, in\nthe helical system, two different types of solutions are admitted, one right-handed and one\nleft-handed. To express properly the helical surface magnetic current, it is necessary to\nrepresent in a helical coordinate system differential equations for the MS-potential function:\nthe Walker equation inside a ferrite and the Laplace equation outside a ferrite. Such an\nanalysis is beyond the frames of this paper and is the subject of our future investigations.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] R. A. Hergstrom et al., Am. J. Phys., 56, 1086 (1988).\n[2] Ya. B.
