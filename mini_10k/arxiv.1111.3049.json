A detected drift in \u03bc or \u03b1 could thus\nprovide valuable insight into the fundamental workings\nof nature beyond our current understanding. To date,\nlaboratory measurements have verified the stability of \u03bc\nand \u03b1 on the fractional level of 10\u221214 [2] and 10\u221217 [3] per\nannum, respectively. More stringent laboratory tests are\nfurther motivated by recent evidence of a spatial gradient\nin the value of \u03b1 based on an analysis of quasar absorption spectra [4]. It has been suggested that the Earth's\nmotion relative this gradient may lead to measureable\neffects in the laboratory [5].\nThe Ye group at JILA (Boulder) aims to test the stability of \u03bc to high precision using Sr2 molecules confined\nin an optical lattice [6]. The experimental protocol, as\noutlined by Zelevinsky et al. [7, 8], calls for optical Raman spectroscopy between select vibrational levels of the\nX 1 \u03a3+\ng ground electronic potential. A variation in \u03bc alters the vibrational spectrum, and experimental sensitivity to this change may be optimized with a prudent choice\nof levels to incorporate into the spectroscopic scheme. It\nwas shown in Refs. [7, 9] that, with respect to variation\nin \u03bc, the lowest and highest vibrational levels experience\nminimal displacement relative to the potential, whereas\nlevels in the intermediate part of the spectrum experience a much larger shift. Zelevinsky et al. have focused\non transitions between the n = 27 intermediate level (n\nbeing the vibrational quantum number) and \"anchor\"\nlevels at the bottom and top of the spectrum. Fig. 1\nillustrates the basic objective of the experiment. A detected drift in the frequency ratio R (see Figure) is to\nbe interpreted as a drift in the electron-to-proton mass\nratio.\nHere we investigate the effect of \u03b1 variation on this\n\nh '\n\nn = 27\n\nEnergy\n\narXiv:1111.3049v1 [physics.atom-ph] 13 Nov 2011\n\nCentre for Theoretical Chemistry and Physics, New Zealand Institute\nfor Advanced Study, Massey University, Auckland 0745, New Zealand\n2\nSchool of Physics, University of New South Wales, Sydney 2052, Australia\n(Dated: October 14, 2018)\n\nR=\n\nh\n\n\u2013 '\n'\n\nn=0\nInternuclear Separation\nFIG. 1.

The curve represents the X 1 \u03a3+\ng electronic potential, with horizontal dashed lines corresponding to select\nvibrational levels supported by this potential. Frequencies \u03bd\nand \u03bd \u2032 are to be measured by an optical Ramsey scheme involving an intermediate excited electronic state (not shown).\nThe dimensionless ratio R is sensitive to variations in \u03bc and\nis independent of any external reference (clock) frequency.\n\npromising experiment. The electronic potential depends\non \u03b1 through relativistic effects of electron motion. A\nvariation of \u03b1 alters the potential and, consequently, the\nvibrational spectrum supported by it. Thus, a measured\ndrift in R may be due (or partially due) to \u03b1 variation, threatening misinterpretation of the experimental\nresults.\nThe experiment described by Zelevinsky et al. is similar in spirit to an experiment posed simultaneously by\nDeMille et al. [9] to test the stability of \u03bc using diatomic\nmolecules. A key difference is that, whereas Zelevinsky\net al. focus on a single electronic potential, DeMille et\nal. suggest probing the splitting between vibrational lev-\n\n\f2\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\nf (x)\n\nels supported by different electronic potentials. Recently,\nwe analyzed the influence of \u03b1 variation on the experiment of DeMille et al. using a semi-classical (WKB) approach, specifically focusing on the system Cs2 [10]. We\nfound the experiment to be order-of-magnitude as sensitive to fractional variation in \u03b1 as it is to fractional\nvariation in \u03bc. Considering the anticipated precision of\nthis experiment [9], together with the current laboratory\nlimit on \u03b1 variation [3], we concluded that \u03b1 variation\nmay not be negligible for the proposed experiment.

For a given vibrational\nlevel n, we will concern ourselves with the normalized energy En = En /D, where En is the vibrational energy relative to the bottom of the potential and D is the potential\ndepth. Clearly, En is limited to the range 0 < En < 1.\nVariations in \u03bc and \u03b1 induce a shift in En ,\n\u03b4En = (\u2202\u03bc En )\n\n\u03b4\u03bc\n\u03b4\u03b1\n+ (\u2202\u03b1 En )\n,\n\u03bc\n\u03b1\n\nwhere we employ the shorthand notation\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03bc \u2261\n,\n\u2202 ln \u03bc\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b1 \u2261\n.\n\u2202 ln \u03b1\n\nThe quantities \u2202\u03bc En and \u2202\u03b1 En quantify the sensitivity\nof the vibrational level n to fractional variations in the\nelectron-to-proton mass ratio and the fine structure constant, respectively.\nWe could, if desired, regard \u03b4En = \u03b4En \u00d7 D as an\n\"absolute\" energy shift, an association which amounts\nto arbitrarily assuming the potential depth to be fixed\nwith respect to any variation. Fixing any other energy\nreference-such as the atomic unit of energy, given by\ne4 me /h\u03042 = \u03b12 me c2 , or the SI unit of energy, which itself references the hyperfine frequency of Cs as well as\na platinum-iridium prototype mass held in Paris [11]-\nwould be equally justified and would generally yield a\ndifferent \"absolute\" energy shift. Here we actively avoid\nthe possibly slippery notion of absolute energy shift and\nquote results for \u2202\u03bc En and \u2202\u03b1 En , as these are unambiguously defined.\n\nIII.\n\n0.4\n\nTHE MORSE POTENTIAL\n\nThe Morse potential represents an idealized electronic\npotential for a diatomic molecule. It is given by\ni2\nh\nV (r) = D 1 \u2212 e\u2212a(r\u2212r0 ) ,\nwhere r is the internuclear separation, with r0 being the\nequilibrium distance, and a\u22121 is directly related to the\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u221a\nFIG. 2. The function f (x) = 2 x \u2212 1 + 1 \u2212 x . For the\nMorse potential, this function modulates the level sensitivities to both \u03bc and \u03b1 variation across the vibrational spectrum,\nwith the argument x taken as En \u2261 En /D. The most deeply\n(En \u2192 0) and loosely (En \u2192 1) bound levels are insensitive to\nvariations, while intermediate levels have much larger sensitivities.\n\nwidth of the potential. The normalized vibrational energies for the Morse potential are given precisely by the\nformula\nEn = \u01eb n +\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0001\n\n\u00012\n1\n\u2212 \u01eb2 n + 21 ,\n4\n\n(1)\n\np\nwhere \u01eb \u2261 h\u0304a 2/DM and M is the reduced nuclear\nmass.\nFrom Eq. (1) we see that a variation in En may be attributed solely to a variation in the parameter \u01eb. Specifically, we may write\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03b4\u01eb\n\u03b4\u03bc\n\u03b4\u03b1\n\u03b4En = f (En ) = f (En ) (\u2202\u03bc ln \u01eb)\n,\n+ (\u2202\u03b1 ln \u01eb)\n\u01eb\n\u03bc\n\u03b1\n(2)\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u221a\nwhere f (x) = 2 x \u2212 1 + 1 \u2212 x . The function f (x) is\ndisplayed in Fig. 2. This function modulates the sensitivity of the various levels of the vibrational spectrum\nto variations in \u03bc and \u03b1. Notably it approaches zero\nin the limits x \u2192 0 and x \u2192 1 and has a maximum\nat x = 3/4. This translates to minimal sensitivities for\nthe lowest and highest vibrational levels, with the largest\nsensitivities occurring for levels in the intermediate part\nof the spectrum.\nWe may go a step further and, based on physical reasoning, deduce a numerical value for the factor (\u2202\u03bc ln \u01eb)\nappearing in Eq. (2). This is accomplished most transparently by assuming atomic units, though we reiterate\nthat \u01eb itself is dimensionless. When expressed in atomic\nunits, the molecular potential (and its depth, width,\netc.) is independent of the electron-to-proton mass ratio,\nwhereas the reduced mass has a value which is inversely\nproportional to \u03bc. From the definition of \u01eb, it follows\nthat (\u2202\u03bc ln \u01eb) = 1/2.\n\n\f3\nIn contrast to (\u2202\u03bc ln \u01eb), there is not a simple analytical result for the factor (\u2202\u03b1 ln \u01eb). Nevertheless, we may\nprovide a physically reasonable estimate of (\u2202\u03b1 ln \u01eb) by\nrealizing that, in atomic units, the electronic potential\nis independent of \u03b1 in the nonrelativistic limit, having relativistic corrections which scale as (\u03b1Z)2 , with\nZ being the nuclear charge number. This suggests that\n(\u2202\u03b1 ln \u01eb) \u223c (\u03b1Z)2 . From this reasoning, we may suspect\nthe vibrational spectrum of Sr2 to be nearly as sensitive\nto \u03b1 variation as it is to \u03bc variation.\nThe exercise of this section provides us with useful\ninsight which is applicable to real physical systems. A\ntrue potential, of course, is not restricted to the form of\na Morse potential. Nevertheless, the function f (x) displayed in Fig. 2 is expected to give a qualitatively accurate depiction of the sensitivities \u2202\u03bc En and \u2202\u03b1 En versus\nthe normalized energy En . In the vicinity of the equilibrium distance, the potential resembles that of a harmonic oscillator. The lower portion of the energy spectrum is then\n\u0001 well-described by a single term, proportional\nto n + 21 , in a Dunham-type expansion. Across this region, \u2202\u03bc En vs En and \u2202\u03b1 En vs En are essentially linear.\nApproaching the dissociation limit, anharmonic effects\nbecome important and the remaining terms in the Dun\u00012\n\u00013\nham expansion, proportional to n + 21 , n + 12 , etc.,\nthen drive the sensitivities back to zero. The fact that\nthe sensitivities approach zero in the limits En \u2192 0 and\nEn \u2192 1 is a consequence of our choice for the zero of\nenergy (bottom of the potential) and our choice to normalize energy to the dissociation energy.\n\nIV.\n\nAB INITIO CALCULATIONS FOR LEVEL\nSENSITIVITIES\n\nWe have calculated the X 1 \u03a3+\ng potential of Sr2\nusing the relativistic computation chemistry program\nDIRAC10 [12]. In order to reduce computational effort we employed the infinite order two-component relativistic Hamiltonian obtained after the Barysz-SadlejSnijders (BSS) transformation of the Dirac Hamiltonian\nin a finite basis set [13]. This approximation includes\nboth scalar and spin-orbit relativistic effects to infinite\norder and is one of the most computer time efficient and\naccurate approximations to the four-component DiracCoulomb Hamiltonian. Electron correlation was taken\ninto account using closed-shell single-reference coupledcluster theory including single, double, and perturbative\ntriple excitations [CCSD(T)]. The Faegri dual family basis set [14] was used, augmented by diffuse and high\nangular momentum exponents to obtain 21s18p12d6f 2g\nGaussian orbitals. Virtual orbitals with energies above\n45 a.u. were omitted, and the 56 outer core electrons were\ncorrelated.\nWe subsequently fed our CCSD(T) potential curve into\na Matlab routine to solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for\nthe nuclear part of the molecular wave function within\nthe Born-Oppenheimer approach. A symmetric three-\n\npoint finite difference method was applied to obtain the\nnuclear eigenfunctions together with their corresponding\nvibrational energies. For the discretization of the internuclear distance a step size of 7 \u00d7 10\u22123 \u00c5 was chosen.\nWe may gauge the accuracy of our ab initio method\nthrough direct comparison with experimental results of\nGerber et al. [15]. These authors have tabulated energies for the n = 0 through n = 35 portion of the\nX 1 \u03a3+\ng vibrational spectrum. Furthermore, they have\ndetermined the dissociation energy of this state to be\nD = 1060(30) cm\u22121 . Our computed dissociation energy,\nD = 993 cm\u22121 , is about 2\u03c3 lower than the experimental value. Comparing individual levels, we find that our\ncomputed vibrational energies differ from experimental\nvalues by no more than 2 cm\u22121 for levels spanning the\nlower half of the potential depth (n = 0 through n = 15).\nAbove this, our computed energies steadily diverge from\nexperiment values, with our values being increasingly\nsmaller in comparison. For example, for n = 27 our\ncomputed energy En = 789 cm\u22121 is 3% lower than the\nexperimental value En = 811 cm\u22121 , whereas for n = 35\nour computed energy En = 889 cm\u22121 is 5% lower than\nthe experimental value En = 940 cm\u22121 . This divergence\nin the upper part of the spectrum is undoubtedly correlated to the fact that our dissociation energy is lower\nthan the experimental dissociation energy.\nTo see how the normalized energies change with respect\nto variations in \u03bc and \u03b1, we recompute the potential energy curve, as well as the vibrational spectrum supported\nby it, for various values of \u03bc and \u03b1 in the neighborhood\nof \u03bc = 1/1836 and \u03b1 = 1/137. The computational chemistry programs assume atomic units; numerical variations\nin \u03bc and \u03b1 are effected by modifying parameter values\nfor the reduced mass within our Matlab routine and the\nspeed of light within DIRAC10 (M = 44 \u03bc\u22121 a.u. for\n88\nSr2 and c = 1/\u03b1 a.u., where a.u. denotes the respective\natomic units of mass and velocity). We then obtain the\nsensitivities \u2202\u03bc En and \u2202\u03b1 En from numerical differentiation with respect to \u03bc and \u03b1. We emphasize that our\nmethod for obtaining these sensitivities treats variations\nin \u03bc and \u03b1 in a similar manner and on equal footing. Figure 3 displays our results for \u2202\u03bc En and \u2202\u03b1 En for the levels\nn = 0 through n = 35; these level sensitivities are plotted versus the normalized energy En . We note a behavior\nwhich resembles that \"predicted\" by the Morse potential.\nNamely, both sensitivity curves approach the appropriate limits for En \u2192 0 and En \u2192 1, while simultaneously\npeaking at En \u223c\n= 3/4. Moreover, the curves are found\nto be essentially proportional, with the ratio \u2202\u03b1 En /\u2202\u03bc En\nbeing 0.28\u00b10.02 across the entire range of data (and 0.28\nat the common maximum of the two curves).\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nHere we have considered the influence of \u03b1 variation\non the experiment proposed by Zelevinsky et al.

The relevant observable\nin this experiment is the frequency ratio R, illustrated in\nFig. 1. With one \"anchor\" level taken at the bottom of\nthe spectrum and another at the top, the frequency ratio\nis given approximately by\nR\u223c\n= 2En \u2212 1,\nwhere n labels the intermediate level (e.g., n = 27 in\nFig. 1). Our ab initio computations predict that the\nfrequency ratio R is only 3 to 4 times less sensitive to\nvariation in \u03b1 as it is to variation in \u03bc. Specifically, we\nfind that variations in \u03bc and \u03b1 induce a variation in R\naccording to the relation\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b4\u03bc\n\u03b4\u03b1\n\u03b4R = K\n.\n(3)\n+ 0.28\n\u03bc\n\u03b1\nWe estimate the uncertainty in the factor 0.28 to be on\nthe order of 10%, based primarily on the discrepancy\nof our computed dissociation energy to the experimental\ndissociation energy.

(3), a measured drift in the frequency ratio R cannot, by itself, be used to distinguish\nbetween \u03bc variation or \u03b1 variation. To extract information about variations in the respective constants themselves requires further experimental input. Optical ion\nclocks have been used to test the stability of \u03b1, with the\nratio of clock frequencies being insensitive to \u03bc variation.\nThe current best limit on \u03b1 variation allows for a drift\non the fractional level of 4 \u00d7 10\u221217 /year [3]. For the proposed experiment of Zelevinsky et al., this result may be\nused with Eq. (3) to justify neglect of \u03b1 variation, which\nhas been implicitly assumed in previous works [7, 8]. On\nthe other hand, for high experimental precision-namely,\nexperimental precision capable of detecting a drift in \u03bc\nat the fractional level of 1 \u00d7 10\u221217 /year-equation (3)\nindicates that \u03b1 variation should not be neglected. Such\nhigh precision is conceivable; in the related proposal of\nDeMille et al. [9], referred to in the Introduction, the\nauthors argued that their method could plausibly detect\n\u221217\nfractional variations in \u03bc at <\n\u223c 10 .\nFor such high experimental precision, additional experimental input could perhaps be obtained by substituting\nSr2 with another species, such as Yb2 , in the experiment.\nYb has a similar valence structure as Sr and also has\nisotopes which lack nuclear spin (168,170,172,174,176 Yb).\nMoreover, as with Sr, high precision spectroscopy on\noptically trapped Yb has become a refined art [16, 17].\nFrom the (\u03b1Z)2 scaling of the relativistic corrections to\nthe electronic potential, we may presume that an Yb2\nexperiment would be about equally sensitive to \u03b1 variation as to \u03bc variation, with an estimated sensitivity ratio\n0.28\u00d7(70/38)2 = 0.95. Using Sr2 and Yb2 results in conjunction, one could conceivably determine both \u03bc and \u03b1\nvariation to high precision with the proposed experiment\nof Zelevinsky et al.\n\nVI.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis work was supported by the Marsden Fund, administered by the Royal Society of New Zealand.
