Since the\nseminal work of Markowitz [2], which solved the problem\nunder a certain number of simplifying assumptions (see\nalso Section II), many other studies have been devoted\nto consider several aspects of portfolio optimization both\nfrom a theoretical and from an applied point of view.\nHere we focus our attention on the role of correlation\ncoefficient matrix in portfolio optimization. The estimation of the correlation matrix has unavoidably associated\na statistical uncertainty, which is due to the finite length\nof the asset return time series. Recently, there have been\nseveral contributions in the econophysics literature devoted to quantify the degree of statistical uncertainty\npresent in a correlation matrix. The results of these investigations have been obtained by using concepts and\ntools of random matrix theory (RMT) [3]. The RMT\nquantification of the statistical uncertainty associated\nwith the estimation of the correlation coefficient matrix\nof a finite multivariate time series has been recently used\nto device a procedure to filter the information present\nin the correlation coefficient matrix which is robust with\nrespect to the unavoidable statistical uncertainty (in the\neconophysics literature it has been used the term of noise\ndressing) [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18].\nThe correlation matrices obtained by this filtering procedure has been used in portfolio optimization. Some\nstudies [7, 10] have shown that under the assumption of\n\n\u2217 Opinions expressed in this paper are exclusively by the authors\nand do not necessarily reflect those of Banca d'Italia\n\nIn recent years, other filtering procedures of the correlation coefficient matrix performed using correlation\nbased clustering procedures has also been proposed in\nthe econophysics literature [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25,\n26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]. These methods\nalso select information of the correlation coefficient matrix which is representative of the entire matrix and it\nis often less affected by the statistical uncertainty and\ntherefore more stable than the entire matrix during the\ntime evolution of the system.\n\nIn this paper we investigate how the portfolio optimization procedure is sensitive to different filtering procedures\napplied to the correlation coefficient matrix. Specifically\nwe consider filtering procedures based on RMT and on\ncorrelation based clustering procedures. The paper is organized as follows. In Section II we describe briefly the\nmean variance optimization problem, we define the notation and we summarize the problem of the estimation of\nthe correlation matrix. In Section III we review the approach recently introduced [7, 10] which makes use of the\nRMT to improve the portfolio optimization in the presence of estimation errors due to the finiteness of sample\ndata. In Section IV we describe the clustering algorithms\nused to perform the portfolio optimization. These algorithms are average linkage and single linkage. In Section V we describe two methods based on these clustering algorithms to build asset portfolios which are robust\nand reliable. Finally in Section VI we summarize our\nresults and indicate future work extending and possibly\nimproving our method.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nPORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION\nA.\n\nMarkowitz's solution\n\nIn this section we briefly discuss the basic aspects of\nMarkowitz portfolio optimization. This is also useful to\nset the notation and to state the assumption made and\nthe methods used. Given N risky assets the portfolio\ncomposition is determined by the weights pi (i = 1, ..., N )\ngiving the fraction of wealth invested in asset i. The\nPN\nweights are normalized as\ni=1 pi = 1. The average\nreturn and the variance of the portfolio are\nrp \u2261\n\u03c3p2 \u2261\n\nN\nX\n\np i mi\n\n(1)\n\npi pj \u03c3ij ,\n\n(2)\n\ni=1\n\nN X\nN\nX\ni=1 j=1\n\nwhere mi is the mean return of asset i and \u03c3ij is the\ncovariance between returns of asset i and j. The optimization problem consists in finding the vector p which\nminimizes \u03c3p for a given value of rp . We assume that\nshort selling is allowed, i.e. pi can assume negative values. As known the solution of this optimization problem\nhas been found by Markowitz [2] and it is\np\u2217 = \u03bb\u03a3\u22121 1 + \u03b3\u03a3\u22121 m\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03a3 is the covariance matrix, 1T = (1, ..., 1) and m\nis the vector of the mean returns of the N assets. The\nother parameters are\nC \u2212 rp B\n\u2206\nA = 1T \u03a3\u22121 1\nC = mT \u03a3\u22121 m\n\u03bb=\n\nB.\n\nrp A \u2212 B\n\u2206\nB = 1T \u03a3\u22121 m\n\u2206 = AC \u2212 B 2\n\u03b3=\n\nis important to develop methods able to filter the part of\nthe covariance matrix which is less likely to be affected\nby statistical uncertainty, and use (when possible) the\nfiltered information to build portfolios.\nIn this paper we are mainly concerned with the problems in the portfolio optimization due to the estimation\nof the correlation matrix, i.e the matrix whose entries\nare the correlation coefficient between returns of different assets. The correlation coefficient is defined as\n\u221a\n\u03c1ij \u2261 \u03c3ij / \u03c3ii \u03c3jj . Therefore we will use the following\nprocedure [7, 10] to assess the effectiveness of the filtering\nprocedure of the correlation coefficient matrix based on\nRMT. Given N assets, a portfolio horizon of T trading\ndays and a time t0 when the optimization is supposed\nto take place, we compute the correlation matrix in the\nT days preceding t0 but we compute the mean returns\n\u221a\nmi and the volatilities \u03c3i \u2261 \u03c3ii in the T days following\nt0 . We use these data to compute the covariance matrix\nand the predicted optimal portfolio at time t0 . We then\ncompare the predicted risk-return curve with the realized\nrisk-return curve obtained by computing\n\u03c3\u0302p2 \u2261\n\nN X\nN\nX\n\n(4)\n\ni=1 j=1\n\nwhere p\u2217i are the weights obtained in the optimization\nand \u03c3\u0302ij is the covariance matrix observed between t0 and\nt0 + T . By using this procedure we are able to decouple the problem of estimating cross correlations from the\nproblem of estimating mean returns and volatilities. In\nother words we will assume that the investor has a perfect forecast of mi and \u03c3i and all her uncertainty is in\nthe estimation of the cross correlation matrix.\nIn order to quantify and compare the goodness of different filtering methods we make use of three measures.\nThe first quantity measuring the reliability of the portfolio is obtained by comparing, for a given value of expected\nreturn, the risk \u03c3p predicted by using the past correlation\nmatrix with the realized risk \u03c3\u0302p of Eq. 4. A portfolio is\nmore reliable when\n\nCurse of dimensionality and adopted method\n\nThe Markowitz's solution to the optimization problem\nrelies upon a series of assumptions that are rarely observed in practice. First of all the asset returns are assumed to be Gaussian variables whereas fat tails in price\nreturn distribution are observed. Second the parameters\nused in the optimization, i.e. the mean values m and the\ncovariance matrix \u03a3, are assumed constant. Finally even\nif these quantity are really constant in the time horizon\nrelevant for the problem, their statistical estimation over\nfinite time intervals T leads to the problem known as\ncurse of dimensionality. Since the covariance matrix has\nN (N \u2212 1)/2 \u223c N 2 /2 distinct entries whereas the number of records used in the estimation is N T , one needs\ntime series of length T >> N in order to have small error on the covariance. But for long T non stationarity\nbecomes more and more important. For these reasons it\n\np\u2217i p\u2217j \u03c3\u0302ij ,\n\nR\u2261\n\n|\u03c3\u0302p \u2212 \u03c3p |\n\u03c3p\n\n(5)\n\nis small. We have also used different measures of the\nreliability, such as |\u03c3\u0302p \u2212 \u03c3p |, obtaining similar results.\nThe second quantity used to compare different methods is simply the realized risk \u03c3\u0302p . Clearly a portfolio is\nless risky of another one when its realized risk is smaller.\nNote that in general a portfolio with a small risk is not\nnecessarily better than a more risky portfolio. In fact if\nthe uncertainty on the risk of the safe portfolio is very\nlarge, an investor could face large fluctuations and therefore a larger loss.\nThe third characteristic for evaluating portfolio optimization methods is the degree of reduction in the effective dimension of the portfolio. Dealing with a large\nportfolio can be very costly because of the transaction\ncosts that the investor has to face any time she wants to\n\n\f3\nrebalance the weights. Even if we do not consider here\nthe problem of portfolio rebalancing and benchmarking,\nwe wish to quantify the \"effective\" number of stocks with\na significant amount of money invested in. We quantify\nthis number as\n1\nN (ef f ) = PN\n\ni=1\n\np2i\n\n(6)\n\nThis quantity is equal to 1 when all the wealth is invested in only one asset, whereas it is equal to N when\nthe wealth is divided equally among the N assets, i.e.\npi = 1/N . It may be worth noting that the quantity\nN (ef f ) does not give the number of assets where a non\nvanishing amount of wealth is invested in. It simply gives\na rough estimate of the number of assets that could effectively be used to build a smaller portfolio with riskreturns properties not too far from the original N asset\nportfolio.\nIn the next sections, the different filtering procedures\nconsidered in this paper are investigated by using the set\nof data of 1071 stocks continuosly traded at New York\nStock Exchange (NYSE) during the period 1988-1998. In\nthis study, we consider daily returns.\nIII.\n\nFIG. 1: The continuous lines are the predicted risk\nand the dashed lines are the realized risk. The circles refer to the Markowitz portfolio optimization,\nwhereas the squares are the predicted and realized\nrisk curves obtained by filtering the correlation matrix with the Random Matrix Theory approach. We\nassume that the only uncertainty of the investor is\non the correlation matrix. The dataset is composed\nby the 150 most capitalized stocks at NYSE in the\nperiod 1989 \u2212 1992. The first two years are used\nfor the estimation of the correlation matrix and the\nother two years are the investment period.\n\nRANDOM MATRIX THEORY APPROACH\n\nRecently [5, 6] it has been shown that the RMT can\nbe useful to investigate the properties of return correlation matrices of financial assets. The simpler random\nmatrix is a matrix of given type and size whose entries\nconsist of random numbers from some specified distribution [3]. RMT was developed originally in nuclear physics\nand then applied to many different fields. In the context\nof asset portfolios RMT is useful because allows to compute the effect of statistical uncertainty in the estimation\nof the correlation matrix. Suppose that the N assets are\ndescribed by N time series of length T and that the returns are independent Gaussian random variables with\nzero mean and variance \u03c3 2 . The correlation matrix of\nthis set of variables in the limit T \u2192 \u221e is simply the\nidentity matrix. When T is finite the correlation matrix will in general be different from the identity matrix.\nRMT allows to prove that in the limit T, N \u2192 \u221e, with a\nfixed ratio Q = T /N \u2265 1, the eigenvalue spectral density\nof the covariance matrix is given by\nT p\n(\u03bbmax \u2212 \u03bb)(\u03bb \u2212 \u03bbmin ),\n(7)\n2\u03c0\u03c3 2 \u03bb\np\n2\nwhere \u03bbmax\nmin = \u03c3 (1 + 1/Q \u00b1 2 1/Q). The spectral density is different from zero in the interval ]\u03bbmin , \u03bbmax [. In\nthe case of a correlation matrix \u03c3 2 = 1. The spectrum\ndescribed by Eq. (7) is different from N \u03b4(\u03bb \u2212 1) which\nis expected by an identity correlation matrix. In other\nwords RMT quantifies the role of the finiteness of the\nlength of the time series on the spectral properties of the\ncorrelation matrix.\n\u03c1(\u03bb) =\n\nRMT has been applied to correlation matrices of returns of financial assets [5, 6] and it has been shown that\nthe spectrum of a typical portfolio can be divided in three\nclasses of eigenvalues. The largest eigenvalue is totally\nincompatible with Eq. (7) and describes the common behavior of the stocks composing the portfolio. A fraction\nof the order of 5% of the eigenvalues are also incompatible with the RMT because they fall outside the interval\n]\u03bbmin , \u03bbmax [. These eigenvalues probably describe economic information stored in the correlation matrix. The\nremaining large part of the eigenvalues is between \u03bbmin\nand \u03bbmax and thus one cannot say whether any information is contained in the corresponding eigenspace.\nThe fact that by using RMT it is possible, under certain assumptions, to identify the noisy part of the correlation matrix suggested several authors [7, 10] to use\nRMT in the optimization of financial portfolios. Specifically the suggested method [10] is the following.\nOne computes the correlation matrix and finds the\nspectrum ranking the eigenvalues such that \u03bbk < \u03bbk+1 .\nOne then computes the variance of the part not explained\nby the highest eigenvalue as \u03c3 2 = 1 \u2212 \u03bb1 /N and uses this\nvalue in Eq. 7 to compute \u03bbmin and \u03bbmax . One then\nconstructs a filtered diagonal matrix obtained by setting\nto zero all the eigenvalues smaller than \u03bbmax and leaving unaltered the remaining ones. Finally one obtains the\nfiltered correlation matrix by transforming the filtered diagonal matrix in the original basis. In order to obtain a\nmeaningful correlation matrix we set to one the diagonal\nelements of the filtered correlation matrix. This matrix\n\n\f4\npreserve only the information of the original correlation\nmatrix that the RMT recognize as signal. It has been\nshown that the portfolio obtained by using the filtered\ncorrelation matrix has a smaller value of R than a portfolio with weights obtained with the Markowitz's procedure\nand by using the whole correlation matrix. As an example we show in Figure 1 the predicted and realized risk\nfor a portfolio of the 150 most capitalized stocks traded\nat NYSE in a period of T = 500 trading days. In this and\nin the other figures the risk and return are computed on a\nyearly time horizon. We have estimated the correlation\nmatrix in the two year period 1989-1990 and the realized risk is computed in the two year period 1991-1992.\nThe figure shows the risk-return curve for the Markowitz\nportfolio and for a portfolio obtained by filtering the correlation matrix with the RMT method outlined above.\nWe note that for all the value of the expected return rp\nthe parameter R for the RMT portfolio is significantly\nsmaller than for the Markowitz portfolio. For this portfolio the realized risk of the RMT portfolio is smaller than\nthe realized risk of the Markowitz portfolio. This is in\nagreement with what, for example, Rosenow et al. [10]\nfind for another set of data. We wish to point out that\nthe behavior of Fig. 1 is rather common in different portfolios. However, we have found that for some portfolios\nthe realized risk profile obtained with the RMT filtering is larger than the one obtained with the Markowitz\napproach.\n\nIV.\n\nCLUSTERING ALGORITHMS\n\nIn this paper, we introduce a new portfolio optimization technique which is based on clustering algorithms.\nClustering is a common practice in multivariate data\nanalysis [36]. The purpose of clustering analysis is to\nobtain a meaningful partition of a set of N variables\nin groups according to their characteristics. For example in correlation based clustering algorithms (adopted\nhere) the correlation coefficient between two time series is assumed as a measure of the similarity between\nthe two time series. Correlation based clustering has\nbeen recently used to infer the hierarchical structure of a\nportfolio of stocks from its correlation coefficient matrix\n[19, 23, 31]. Correlation based clustering may be seen\nas a filtering procedure, i.e. a matrix transformation retaining a smaller number of distinct elements. After its\napplication one usually retain a subset of the distinct elements composing the correlation coefficient matrix. For\nexample, in the clustering algorithm of the single linkage [37] the number of distinct elements present in the\nfiltered matrix is n \u2212 1 whereas the number of distinct\nelements present in the original matrix is n(n \u2212 1)/2.\nThe selection of these n \u2212 1 elements is done according\nto some widespread algorithm [38]. A possible conceptual description of the algorithm is the following. Let us\nassume that a similarity measure S between pairs of elements is defined, e.g. the correlation coefficient between\n\npairs of elements of the system. An ordered list Sord of\npair of elements can be constructed by arranging them\nin a descending order accordingly with the value of the\nsimilarity sij between element i and element j. Different\nelements are iteratively included in clusters starting from\nthe first two elements of the similatity measure ordered\nlist. At each step, when two elements or one element and\na cluster or two clusters p and q merge in a wider single cluster t, the similarity or distance between the new\ncluster t and cluster r is determined as follows: if sij is\na correlation-like measure\nstr = max{spr , sqr }\n\n(8)\n\nindicating that the similarity between any element of\ncluster t and any element of cluster r is the similarity\nbetween the two most similar entities in clusters t and r.\nConversely, if sij is a distance-like measure\nstr = min{spr , sqr }.\n\n(9)\n\nBy applying iterarively this procedure n \u2212 1 of the\nn(n \u2212 1)/2 distinct elements of the correlation coefficient\nmatrix are selected. When\np a distance-like measure is used\nas, for example, dij = 2(1 \u2212 \u03c1ij ) [39], the distance matrix obtained by applying the single linkage procedure is\nan ultrametric matrix comprising the n \u2212 1 distinct selected elements. Ultrametric distances d<\nij are distances\n<\n<\nsatisfying a inequality d<\n\u2264\nmax{d\n,\nd\nac\nab bc } stronger than\nthe customary triangular inequality dac \u2264 dab + dbc [40].\nIn particular, the single linkage clustering procedure has\nassociated an ultrametric correlation coefficient matrix\nwhich is the subdominant ultrametric matrix of the original correlation coefficient matrix. For a didactic description of the method used to obtain the ultrametric matrix\none can consult Ref. [41].\nIn Ref. [42] it is proved that the ultrametric correlation matrix obtained by the single linkage clustering\nprocedure of the correlation coefficient matrix is always\npositive definite when all the elements of the obtained\nultrametric correlation matrix are positive. This condition is rather common in financial data of stock portfolio\nand it has always been observed for all the investigations\nwe have performed so far. The effectiveness of the single\nlinkage clustering procedure in pointing out the hierarchical structure of the investigated portfolio has been shown\nby several studies [19, 21, 23, 26, 27, 29, 31, 32, 33].\nHowever, the single linkage is just one possible correlation based filtering methods. Other methods have also\nbeen applied to financial portfolios [20, 22, 24, 25, 26,\n27, 28, 30, 34, 35]. Each method puts a specific emphasis on some aspects of the original matrix and is usually\nable to point out a series of aspects that might not be\nelucidated by different filtering procedure. The choice\nof the filtering method must therefore be guided by the\nspecific goals that one pursues. In the present study, we\ndecide to consider the average linkage procedure in addition to the single linkage procedure. The average linkage is another widespread clustering algorithm [43]. The\n\n\f5\ndifference with the single linkage algorithm is that the\nsimilarity measure between an element and the closest\ncluster is given by the mean similarity measure between\nthe considered element and each element of the closest\ncluster. In other words, if sij is a similarity-like measure,\nat each stage one obtains str between clusters t and r defined as above, as the average distance between all pairs\nof links of the elements belonging to the two clusters.\nFor a detailed discussion of the average linkage cluster\nalgorithm see, for example Ref. [43]. Also in the case\nof the average linkage the filtered correlation coefficient\nmatrix is a ultrametric distance. In Ref. [42] it is proved\nthat the ultrametric correlation coefficient matrix associated with the average linkage clustering procedure is\npositive definite under the same general conditions valid\nfor the case of the single linkage. However, this property\nis not generic to all clustering procedures. We have verified that it does not apply for the cases of the complete\nlinkage and for the Ward clustering method.\n\nV.\n\nPORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION WITH\nCLUSTERING ALGORITHMS\n\nThe portfolio optimization method we propose here is\nbased on the use of the ultrametric matrix associated to\na given clustering method as a meaningful and robust filtration of the original correlation matrix. In other words\nwe construct the portfolio by solving the Markowitz optimization problem by using the ultrametric matrix rather\nthan the original correlation matrix or the RMT filtered\nmatrix. The reasons for this choice are (i) it is known\nthat clustering algorithms are able to filter the relevant\ninformation in a multivariate set of data (ii) other studies indicate that clustering algorithms are quite robust\nwith respect to measurement noise due to the finiteness\nof sample size. This is particularly true for set of variables hierarchically organized [42].\nFrom the filtered (ultrametric) correlation matrix we\nbuild the portfolio by using the Markowitz result (Eq. 3)\nand for each value of the portfolio return rp we find the\npredicted risk \u03c3p . We note that in order to consider the\nultrametric matrix as a meaningful correlation matrix\nit is important that the matrix is positive definite (or\nsemidefinite). We have performed a very large number\nof portfolio optimization using real data and we have not\nfound a single case in which the ultrametric matrix is\nnot positive definite. We used the weights obtained from\nthe optimization to compute the realized risk by using\nEq. 4 where \u03c3\u0302ij is the original covariance matrix. In other\nwords we use the filtered matrix only for obtaining the\nweights pi , whereas the realized risk is clearly determined\nby the whole correlation matrix.\n\nFIG. 2: The continuous lines are the predicted risk\nand the dashed lines are the realized risk. The filled\nblue circles refer to the portfolio obtained with the\naverage linkage method. The empty circles refer to\nthe Markowitz portfolio optimization, whereas the\nsquares are the predicted and realized risk curves\nobtained by filtering the correlation matrix with the\nRandom Matrix Theory approach (same data as in\nFig. 1). We assume that the only uncertainty of the\ninvestor is on the correlation matrix. The dataset\nis composed by the 150 most capitalized stocks at\nNYSE in the period 1989\u22121992. The first two years\nare used for estimate the correlation matrix and the\nother two years are the investment period.\n\nA.\n\nAverage linkage\n\nWe consider first portfolio built by using correlation\nmatrices filtered with the average linkage cluster algorithm.\n\n1.\n\nReliability\n\nFigure 2 shows the predicted and realized risk for the\nportfolio obtained with the average linkage considering\nthe same set of stocks and the same time period as in\nFig. 1. The distance between predicted and realized risk\nfor the portfolio obtained with average linkage is significantly smaller than the distance for the portfolio obtained with the RMT. This result indicates clearly that\nthe use of clustering methods to build financial portfolio\nis able to provide portfolios more reliable (in terms of the\nerror in the forecasted risk) than the ones obtained with\nRMT and with Markowitz optimization. We also note\nthat for this set of data the realized risk of the portfolio obtained with the clustering method is almost always\nsmaller than the realized risk of the RMT portfolio.\nIn order to verify the robustness of these results we\nhave performed an extensive bootstrap experiment. We\nhave considered many different values of the portfolio size\nN and of the investment horizon T and for each couple\n(N, T ) we have randomly sampled 50 portfolio composed\n\n\f6\naround N \u2243 50 where it is possible to build portfolio\nwith average linkage which are reliable and not too risky.\nIt is important to stress that, as for Figure 3, the above\nresult on riskiness is obtained by putting together all the\nvalues of portfolio expected return rp . On the other hand\nwe find that the riskiness of average linkage portfolio\ncompared to RMT portfolio strongly depends on rp especially for large portfolios. Specifically when we consider\nlarge portfolios (50 < N < 500) we find that for small\nrp only in \u223c 25% of the cases the average linkage portfolio is less risky than RMT portfolio. When rp is large\nthis fraction is of the order of \u223c 45%. In other words for\nportfolios with large rp the average linkage portfolios is\napproximately as risky as the RMT portfolios.\nFIG. 3: Density plot showing the percentage of\nsuccess of the average linkage portfolio optimization technique over the Random Matrix Theory approach as a function of the number of asset N and\nthe investment period T . The white area corresponding to cases where T < N + 50 is not considered in our investigation.\n\nby N stocks and we have selected randomly 50 initial\ntimes t0 . For each portfolio we have considered 10 values\nof the expected portfolio return rp . Specifically we have\ntaken ten equispaced values of rp between the value of\nrp associated with the absolute minimum risk and the\nhighest expected return among the N stocks of the portfolio. For each expected return and for each portfolio we\nhave computed the parameter R and we have counted the\nfraction of times that Rav.link < RRMT , i.e. the percentage of cases in which the portfolio obtained with average\nlinkage is more reliable than the portfolio obtained with\nRandom Matrix Theory. The result of this analysis is\nshown in Figure 3. The figure indicates that the average\nlinkage portfolio outperforms the RMT portfolio almost\nfor any value of N and T . For N \u2243 350 and T \u2243 500 the\naverage linkage portfolio is more reliable than the RMT\nportfolio more than 85% of the times. The reliability of\naverage linkage portfolio is higher when the number of\nstocks is large, For small size (N < 50) portfolios the\ntwo methods are statistically equally reliable.\n\n2.\n\nRiskiness\n\nWe now compare the realized risk of the portfolios obtained with the two methods, i.e. RMT and average linkage. The realized risk is a measure of the riskiness of the\nportfolio. We observe that small size portfolio tends to\nbe less risky when obtained with the average linkage,\nwhereas as N increases the RMT portfolios become less\nrisky. The boundary between the two regions is approximately for N \u223c 75. By comparing this result with figure\n3 we see that when the average linkage is more reliable\nit is also riskier and vice-versa. There is a small region\n\n3.\n\nEffective size\n\nFinally we consider the effective size N (ef f ) of the\nportfolio as quantified by Eq. 6. We consider three portfolio sizes, i.e. N = 50, 300, and 500, and we select two\nvalues of the portfolio expected return rp , i.e. the minimum value (corresponding to the minimum risk) and an\nintermediate value between the minimum and the maximum. Figure 4 shows N (ef f ) as a function of the investment horizon T . Similar results are observed for high\nvalues of expected return, but in this case the dimensionality of the portfolio becomes smaller and smaller and the\nwealth is more and more concentrated in the asset with\nhighest return. We note that for small portfolio (N = 50)\nthe effective size of RMT portfolios is slightly smaller\nthan the effective size for average linkage portfolios. On\nthe other hand for larger portfolios the effective size of\naverage linkage portfolios is significantly smaller than the\neffective size of RMT portfolios. This result shows that\nportfolios built with average linkage have a smaller effective dimensionality, i.e. the maintenance cost of these\nportfolios is smaller than for the one of RMT portfolios.\n\nB.\n\nSingle linkage\n1.\n\nReliability\n\nWe performed the same analysis by using a different\nclustering algorithm, specifically the single linkage cluster analysis. By using the same data as in Figures 1 and\n2 we compute the curves for predicted and realized risk\nfor a portfolio built by using the ultrametric matrix associated with the single linkage algorithm. The result is in\nFig. 5. Also in this case the predicted and realized risk\nfor single linkage portfolio are significantly closer than\nthe corresponding quantities for Markowitz and for RMT\nportfolios. In this case it is more evident that the realized risk of the single linkage portfolio is larger than the\nother two realized risks. Thus the single linkage portfolio\nis riskier but more reliable when compared with RMT\nportfolio.\n\n\f7\n\nFIG. 4: Effective size N (ef f ) of the porfolio as defined in Eq. 6 as a function of investment horizon T .\nThe black circles refer to RMT portfolio and the red\nsquares to average linkage portfolio. The portfolio\nsize is N = 50 (panels (a) and (b)), N = 300 (panels (c) and (d)) and N = 500 (panels (e) and (f)).\nThe left panels (a,c, and e) refer to the minimum\nvalue of portfolio expected return rp and the right\npanels (b,d, and f) refer to an intermediate value of\nrp . Every point is the average over 50 realizations\nobtained by bootstrapping and the error bars are\nstandard errors.\n\nFIG. 6: Density plot showing the percentage of\nsuccess of the single linkage portfolio optimization technique over the Random Matrix Theory approach as a function of the number of asset N and\nthe investment period T . The white area corresponding to cases where T < N + 50 is not considered in our investigation.\n\nAlso for the single linkage method we perform a bootstrap analysis similar to the one described above for the\naverage linkage method in order to compare the reliability\nof single linkage method as compared to RMT method.\nThe result is the density plot shown in Fig. 6. We find\nthat the single linkage method is able to provide more\nreliable portfolios in wide ranges of the parameters N\nand T . This is more and more evident for portfolios with\nT \u2243 N , i.e. portfolios for which the investment horizon (in trading days) is comparable with the portfolio\nsize N . It is interesting to note that for these portfolio\nthe effect of the measurement noise (\"noise dressing\") is\nparticularly high.\n\n2.\nFIG. 5: The continuous lines are the predicted\nrisk and the dashed lines are the realized risk. The\nfilled green diamonds refer to the portfolio obtained\nwith the single linkage method. The empty circles refer to the Markowitz portfolio optimization,\nwhereas the squares are the predicted and realized risk curves obtained by filtering the correlation matrix with the Random Matrix Theory approach (same data as in fig. 1). We assume that\nthe only uncertainty of the investor is on the correlation matrix. The dataset is composed by the\n150 most capitalized stocks at NYSE in the period\n1989 \u2212 1992. The first two years are used for estimate the correlation matrix and the other two years\nare the investment period.\n\nRiskiness\n\nThe analysis of the riskiness, i.e. the realized risk, of\nsingle linkage portfolios shows that these portfolio are\nsystematically riskier than RMT portfolios. This is also\nseen in the example shown in figure 5. Only for very small\nsize (N < 15) the single linkage portfolios are less risky\nthan RMT portfolios. As for the average linkage portfolio\nthis effect strongly depends on the portfolio expected return. When we consider large portfolios (50 < N < 500)\nwe find that for small rp only in \u223c 0.3% of the cases the\nsingle linkage portfolio is less risky than RMT portfolio.\nWhen rp is large this fraction is of the order of \u223c 10%. In\nany case these figures indicate that single linkage portfolios are risky, even if they can be quite reliable.\n\n\f8\n\nFIG. 7: Effective size N (ef f ) of the porfolio as defined in Eq. 6 as a function of investment horizon\nT . The black circles refer to RMT portfolio and the\nred squares to single linkage portfolio. The portfolio\nsize is N = 50 (panels (a) and (b)), N = 300 (panels (c) and (d)) and N = 500 (panels (e) and (f)).\nThe left panels (a,c, and e) refer to the minimum\nvalue of portfolio expected return rp and the right\npanels (b,d, and f) refer to an intermediate value of\nrp . Every point is the average over 50 realizations\nobtained by bootstrapping and the error bars are\nstandard errors.\n\n3.\n\nEffective size\n\nThe effective size N (ef f ) of the portfolio as quantified\nby Eq. 6 for the single linkage portfolio shows interesting\nproperties. Figure 7 shows the effective size for different\nportfolio conditions and should be compared with figure 4. We see that for any value of the portfolio size N\nthe effective size of the single linkage portfolio is significantly smaller than the one of the RMT portfolio. This\neffect is observed also for small size portfolios, in contrast with what we observe for average linkage portfolios.\nEven more important, for large portfolios (where the size\nreduction is an important issue) the single linkage portfolios have an effective size which is roughly half the effective size of RMT portfolio. This result suggest that single\nlinkage portfolios could be used to detect a small subset of\nstocks which is representative of the whole portfolio, and\nthus to replace the original portfolio with another one of\nsignificantly smaller size with reduced maintenance costs.\nThis possibility will be explored in a future work.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have performed portfolio optimization\nby using filtered correlation coefficient matrices. These\nmatrices have been obtained by applying different filtering methods to the original correlation coefficient matrix. We have proposed two filtering methods based on\n\nthe average linkage and single linkage clustering procedures. The optimal portfolios obtained with these two\nnew methods have been compared with the one based on\nRMT recently proposed in Refs [7, 10].\nA large set of simulations has shown that clustering\nmethods are outperforming RMT filtering when we consider the reliability of the estimation of the realized portfolio with respect to the predicted one for portfolios with\na number of assets \u2248 50 < N <\u2248 500. Hence, for relatively large portfolios the clustering filtering methods\nprovide a more reliable estimation of the predicted riskreturn profile both with respect to the Markowitz basic\nestimation and with respect to the determination of the\ncorrelation coefficient done with the RMT filtering\nThe portfolios obtained with the average linkage shows\na predicted and realized risk return profile which is often inside the corresponding profiles obtained both with\nthe Markowitz basic estimation and after the RMT filtering. In the case of the single linkage clustering method\nthe risk-return profile shows risk levels which are systematically higher than the ones obtained both with the\nMarkowitz basic estimation and after the RMT filtering.\nTherefore with respect to the aspect of the level of risk\nassociated to the selected portfolios the most successful\nmethods are the average linkage and the RMT filtering.\nAnother aspect investigated in our study refers to the\ncomposition of the portfolios selected. We have quantified the degree of homogeneity of the distribution of the\nwealth across the stocks of the portfolio through what\nwe have called the \"effective size\" of the portfolio. A\nsmall number of this parameter indicates an uneven distribution of the portfolio wealth suggesting that during\nportfolio re-balancing only a subset of stocks will be significantly involved. The investigation of the \"effective\nsize\" of the portfolio has shown that the average linkage and the RMT are characterized by not too different\nvalues of the \"effective size\". In fact for small portfolios (e.g. N = 50) the RMT has for most values of T a\nsmaller value of the \"effective size\" whereas the pattern\nis reversed for medium (N = 300) and large portfolios\n(N = 500) both for the minimum and intermediate value\nof rp . The pattern is clearly different for the case of the\nsingle linkage filtering. In this case the \"effective size\"\nis always significantly less than the one observed in the\ncases of RMT filtering.\nThe above discussion shows that the different filtering procedures provide different portfolio optimization\nresults that are characterized by specific strengths or\nweaknesses. In other words, for each value of N and\nT , the most useful filtered correlation coefficient matrix\ncan be different depending on the strongest constraint\nthe investor has among the risk level of the portfolio,\nthe reliability of the estimation and the portfolio \"effective size\". We believe that the two clustering methods we\nhave proposed here and the RMT are not exhaustive with\nrespect to all potential aspects of portfolio optimization\nand, probably, other filtering methods could also provide\nvery interesting results in specific regimes of the different\n\n\f9\ncontrol parameters.\nThe different results of the different filtering methods\nraise the scientific question of which is the reason for the\ndifference between the various filtering procedures. A\nprecise quantification of the information retained by the\ndifferent filtered matrices would be very useful. This goal\nis left for future research.\n\nfinancial markets\" .\nF.L. and R.N.M acknowledge support also from the research project MIURFIRB RBNE01CW3M \"Cellular Self-Organizing nets\nand chaotic nonlinear dynamics to model and control\ncomplex system\" and from the European Union STREP\nproject n. 012911 \"Human behavior through dynamics of\ncomplex social networks: an interdisciplinary approach.\".\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nAuthors acknowledge support from the research\nproject MIUR 449/97 \"High frequency dynamics in\n\n[1] E.
