An equally plausible alternative to dark energy is a modification of general relativity\nthat would generate cosmic acceleration [3, 4]. Modifying general relativity in this manner eliminates the need\nfor dark energy, but it does not explain why the vacuum\nenergy is zero. Similar modifications of general relativity\nhave also been proposed to drive inflation [5].\nA possible modification to general relativity that generates an accelerated expansion is 1/R gravity [3], in\nwhich a term proportional to 1/R, where R is the Ricci\nscalar, is added to the Einstein-Hilbert action so that\nthe 1/R term dominates as the Hubble parameter decreases. Soon after the introduction of this theory, it\nwas shown that 1/R gravity is dynamically equivalent\nto a scalar-tensor gravity with no scalar kinetic term\n[6]. Moreover, the equivalence to scalar-tensor gravity\napplies to all modified gravity theories that replace the\nEinstein-Hilbert action with some function of the Ricci\nscalar [known as f (R) gravity], provided that f (R) has a\nnonzero second derivative with respect to R. When the\nscalar field is light, this theory makes predictions that are\nincompatible with Solar System tests of general relativity\n[7, 8, 9]. Consequently, Ref. [6] concluded that a broad\nclass of f (R) gravity theories, including 1/R gravity, are\nruled out by Solar System tests.\nSince then, however, the results in Ref. [6] were criticized by a number of papers [10, 11, 12, 13, 14] and some\n\neven claim that Solar System experiments do not rule\nout any form of f (R) gravity. The essence of the criticism is that f (R) gravity admits the Schwarzschild-de\nSitter solution and hence the vacuum spacetime in the\nSolar System is not different from that in general relativity, although there were also broader objections to the\nequivalence between f (R) and scalar-tensor gravity [12].\nWorking directly with the field equations, a recent paper\n[15] found that even though the Schwarzschild-de Sitter\nmetric is a vacuum solution in 1/R gravity, it does not\ncorrespond to the solution around a spherically symmetric massive body.1 They found that the solution for the\nSolar System is identical to the spacetime derived using\nthe corresponding scalar-tensor theory.\nIn this paper, we generalize the analysis of Ref. [15] to a\nbroad class of f (R) gravities, namely those theories that\nadmit a Taylor expansion of f (R) around the background\nvalue of the Ricci scalar. We work in the metric formalism, where the field equations are obtained by varying\nthe action with respect to the metric and treating the\nRicci scalar as a function of the metric. The Palatini\nformalism, which treats the Ricci scalar as a function of\nthe connection and varies the action with respect to the\nconnection and the metric independently, yields different field equations for f (R) gravity and has been studied\nextensively elsewhere (e.g. Refs. [18, 19, 20, 21, 22]).\nThis paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we\nsolve the linearized field equations around a spherical\nmass and find that the solution in the Solar System is\nin agreement with the solution obtained using the equiv-\n\n1\n\nEddington made a similar mistake in R2 gravity [16], which was\nlater corrected by [17].\n\n\f2\nalent scalar-tensor theory. When f (R) satisfies a condition that is analogous to the scalar field being light in the\nequivalent scalar-tensor theory, the resulting spacetime is\nincompatible with Solar System tests of general relativity. In Section III, we consider how our analysis applies\nto several f (R) gravity theories, including general relativity. This particular example illustrates the connection\nbetween f (R) gravity and general relativity and clarifies\nthe requirements for a general relativistic limit of an f (R)\ntheory. We summarize our conclusions in Section IV.\nII.\n\nWEAK-FIELD SOLUTION AROUND A\nSPHERICAL STAR\n\nWe consider gravitational theories with actions of the\nform\nZ\n\u221a\n1\nd4 x \u2212gf (R) + Sm ,\n(1)\nS=\n2\u03ba\nwhere f (R) is a function of the Ricci scalar R and Sm is\nthe matter action. The field equation obtained by varying the action with respect to the metric is\n1\nfR R\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 f g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd fR + 2fR g\u03bc\u03bd = \u03baT\u03bc\u03bd ,\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere fR \u2261 df /dR. In previous studies, predictions of\nSolar System dynamics in these theories were analyzed\nby appealing to an equivalence with scalar-tensor theories [6]. We review this equivalence in Appendix A. Since\nthe equivalent scalar-tensor theory is incompatible with\nSolar System observations if the scalar field propagates\non Solar System scales, Ref. [6] concluded that the corresponding f (R) theories are ruled out. We now show\nthat this conclusion can be made without appealing to\nthe equivalence between f (R) and scalar-tensor gravity.\nInstead, we work directly with the linearized field equations about a spherical mass distribution. Our treatment\nclarifies and amends a similar analysis presented in Ref.\n[23], and we extend it to cases where the background\nvalue of the Ricci scalar equals zero.\nWe now find the metric that describes the spacetime\naround a spherical body in f (R) gravity in the weak-field\nregime. To do this, we must choose a background spacetime around which to linearize the field equations. The\nonly physically relevant choice is an isotropic and homogeneous background spacetime that solves Eq. (2) for\nsome spatially uniform cosmological stress-energy tensor\ncos\nT\u03bc\u03bd\n. The evolution of the time-dependent and spatially\nhomogeneous background scalar curvature R0 (t) is determined by the trace of Eq. (2),\nfR0 (t)R0 (t) \u2212 2f0 (t) + 32fR0 (t) = \u03baT cos (t),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere fR0 \u2261 df /dR|R=R0 , f0 \u2261 f (R0 ) and T cos \u2261\ncos\ng \u03bc\u03bd T\u03bc\u03bd\n.\nIn order to investigate perturbations away from this\nbackground, we express the Ricci scalar as the sum of\n\ntwo components:\nR(r, t) \u2261 R0 (t) + R1 (r),\n\n(4)\n\nwhere R0 (t) is the spatially homogenous background\ncurvature that solves Eq. (3) and R1 (r) is a timeindependent perturbation to this background curvature.\nWe assume that all derivatives of f (R) are well-defined\nat the present-day value of R0 so that we may use a\nTaylor expansion of f (R) around R = R0 to evaluate\nf (R0 + R1 ) and fR (R0 + R1 ). We will terminate the expansion by neglecting terms nonlinear in R1 . Provided\nthat the higher-order terms of the Taylor series do not\ncancel in some contrived way, neglecting the higher-order\nterms is only justified if the sum of the zeroth-order and\nlinear terms is greater than all other terms in the Taylor\nexpansion. Specifically, we require that\n1 (n)\nf (R0 )R1n ,\n(5)\nn!\n1 (n+1)\nf\n(R0 )R1n , for all n > 1,(6)\n\u226b\nn!\n\nf0 + fR0 R1 \u226b\nfR0 + fRR0 R1\n\nwhere fRR0 \u2261 d2 f /dR2 |R=R0 and f (n) (R0 ) \u2261\ndn f /dRn |R=R0 .\nNow we consider the trace of Eq. (2) with both a\ncosmological matter source described by T cos and a finite,\ntime-independent, spherically symmetric matter source,\ndescribed by T s :\nfR R \u2212 2f + 32fR = \u03ba (T cos + T s ) .\n\n(7)\n\nUsing first-order Taylor expansions to evaluate fR and\nf and neglecting O(R12 ) terms, we obtain a linearized\nversion of Eq. (7):\n\u0014\n3fRR0 2R1 (r) \u2212 fR0 (t)\n\u0015\n\u2212fRR0 (t)R0 (t) \u2212 32fRR0 (t) R1 = \u03baT s .\n(8)\nTo obtain this equation, we used the fact that R0 (t)\nsolves Eq. (3) to eliminate terms that are independent\nof R1 . By dropping O(fRR0 R12 ) terms from Eq. (8) while\nkeeping the fRR0 R0 R1 term, we have implicitly assumed\nthat R1 \u226a R0 if R0 is nonzero. We will check that\nthis condition is satisfied after the discussion following\nEq. (31). If R0 is zero, then the O(fRR0 R12 ) is guaranteed to be smaller than the nonzero terms in Eq. (8) by\nvirtue of Eq. (5). Note that if fRR0 = 0, as in general\nrelativity, this equation becomes simply fR0 R1 = \u2212\u03baT s .\nIf in addition fR0 is nonzero then R1 must vanish outside\nthe star and hence the Schwarzschild-de Sitter solution\nbecomes the solution to the field equation outside the\nsource. However, if fRR0 6= 0, this is no longer necessarily the case.\nFinally, we take our background metric to be a flat\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric. We then\nconsider a spherically symmetric perturbation to this\n\n\f3\nbackground so that the linearized perturbed metric takes\nthe form\nds2 = \u2212[1 + 2\u03a8(r)]dt2\n\b\n+a(t)2 [1 + 2\u03a6(r)]dr2 + r2 d\u03a92 ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the present value of a(t) is one. When solving\nthe field equations, we will keep only terms linear in the\nperturbations \u03a8 and \u03a6.\nWe will now solve Eq. (8) for a nonzero fRR0 . Since\nwe confine our analysis to a static perturbation R1 (r), 2\nbecomes the flat-space Laplacian operator \u22072 . Restricting our analysis to a source with mass density \u03c1(r) and\nnegligible pressure, we may rewrite Eq. (8) as\n\u22072 R1 \u2212 m2 R1 = \u2212\n\n\u03ba\u03c1\n,\n3fRR0\n\nwhere we have defined a mass parameter\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2fRR0\n1 fR0\n.\n\u2212 R0 \u2212 3\nm2 \u2261\n3 fRR0\nfRR0\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\nDue to the evolution of R0 (t), this mass parameter varies\nin time. However, the time-scale of variation in the cosmological background spacetime is comparable to the\ncurrent Hubble time. Since this time-scale is much longer\nthan the time-scale of Solar System dynamics, we may\nneglect the time variation of the background spacetime\nwhen considering the behavior of bodies within the Solar\nSystem [24]. Therefore, for the purposes of this calculation, we take m to be time-independent.\nThe Green's function G(r) for this differential equation\ndepends on the sign of m2 :\n\u001a\n\u2212 cos(mr)/(4\u03c0r)\nm2 < 0,\nG(r) =\n(12)\n\u2212 exp(\u2212mr)/(4\u03c0r) m2 > 0,\np\nwhere m \u2261 |m2 |. If mr \u226a 1, then both Green's functions are approximately \u22121/(4\u03c0r), which is the Green's\nfunction for Laplace's equation. In this case, the term\nproportional to m2 in Eq.

We note that\nwhen applied to 1/R gravity with a static de Sitter background, this result agrees with the result presented in\nRef. [15].\nWe emphasize that in order for this solution for R1\nto be valid, we must have mr \u226a 1. Only when this\ncondition is satisfied is the trace of the field equation\nwell-approximated by Laplace's equation. This restriction was not mentioned in Ref. [23]. The physical interpretation of this constraint is clear when one considers\nthe equivalent scalar-tensor theory. When one switches\nto a frame where the scalar degree of freedom is canonical, the effective mass of the scalar field evaluated in the\n\nJordan frame is [6]\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nR0\n4f0\n2\u03baT cos\nfR0\n2\n.\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\nm\u03c6 =\n3\nfRR0\nfR0\n(fR0 )2\n(fR0 )2\n\n(14)\n\nSince R0 is the solution to Eq. (3), this expression may\nbe simplified to\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 fR0\n2fR0\nm2\u03c6 =\n\u2212 R0 \u2212 6\n.\n(15)\n3 fRR0\nfR0\nIt is clear that both m\u03c6 and m [defined by Eq. (11)] are\nof the same order. Therefore, the condition that mr \u226a 1\nis equivalent to demanding that the scalar field be light\n(m\u03c6 r \u226a 1). See Appendix A for more details.\nIn summary, Eq. (13) is a solution to the trace of the\nfield equation within the Solar System only if the scalar\ndegree of freedom propagates on Solar System scales. In\nterms of f (R), the necessary condition is\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2fRR0\n1 fR0\n\u2212 R0 \u2212 3\nr2 \u226a 1.

(13)\nto solve the field equations for the metric perturbations\n\u03a8 and \u03a6. As we did for the trace of the field equation, we simplify the field equations by replacing f (R)\nand fR (R) with first-order Taylor expansions around the\nbackground value R0 to obtain field equations that are\nlinear in R1 . Using Eq. (3) to simplify this expression,\nwe obtain\n1\nfR0 (R\u03bd\u03bc \u2212 [R0 ]\u03bc\u03bd ) + fRR0 R1 R\u03bd\u03bc \u2212 fR0 R1 \u03b4\u03bd\u03bc\n(19)\n2\n\u2212fRR0 \u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd R1 + \u03b4\u03bd\u03bc fRR0 2R1 = \u03baT s\u03bc\u03bd ,\nwhere [R0 ]\u03bc\u03bd is the unperturbed FRW Ricci tensor and\n\u03b4\u03bd\u03bc is the Kronecker delta. We neglected time derivatives\nof the background metric when deriving this equation.\nAs previously noted, the time-scale of variations in R0 is\nmuch longer than that of Solar System dynamics, making\nthe terms involving time derivatives of R0 irrelevant to\ngravitational effects within the Solar System.\nWe simplify Eq. (19) further by dropping several negligible terms. We continue to ignore terms that depend on\nthe variation of the background spacetime by dropping\n\n\f4\nterms that involve products of \u03a6, \u03a8 and fRR0 R1 with\nH and dH/dt. Since we are working in the weak-field\nregime, we neglect all terms that are nonlinear functions\nof the metric perturbations \u03a6 and \u03a8. Keeping only terms\nthat are linear in \u03a6 and \u03a8 allows us to replace the 2\nwith the flat-space Laplacian operator \u22072 since the perturbation is assumed to be static. Finally, we know from\nEq. (13) that fRR0 R1 \u223c \u03baM/r, and we expect \u03a8 and \u03a6\nto be proportional to \u03baM/r as well. Therefore, fRR0 R1 \u03a8\nand fRR0 R1 \u03a6 are second-order quantities, and we may\nneglect them. With these simplifications, the tt, rr, \u03b8\u03b8\ncomponents of Eq. (19) are respectively\n1\nfR0 \u22072 \u03a8 + fR0 R1 \u2212 fRR0 \u22072 R1 = \u03ba\u03c1,(20)\n\u0012\n\u0013 2\n2 \u2032\n1\n2\n\u2032\u2032\nfR0 \u2212\u03a8 + \u03a6 \u2212 fR0 R1 + fRR0 R1\u2032 = 0, (21)\nr\n2\nr\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\n1 \u2032 1 \u2032\n\u03a6 \u2212 \u03a8 + 2\u03a6\nfR0\nr\nr\nr\n1\n1\n\u2212 fR0 R1 + fRR0 R1\u2032 + fRR0 R1\u2032\u2032 = 0, (22)\n2\nr\nwhere the prime denotes differentiation with respect to\nr. The \u03c6\u03c6 component of Eq. (19) is identical to the \u03b8\u03b8\ncomponent given by Eq. (22).\nRecalling that R1 solves Eq. (10) with m2 = 0 so that\n\u22072 R1 is proportional to the density \u03c1, Eq. (20) may be\nrewritten\n2\n1\nfR0 \u2207 \u03a8 = \u03ba\u03c1 \u2212 fR0 R1 .\n3\n2\n2\n\n(23)\n\nWe express \u03a8 as the sum of two functions: \u03a8 = \u03a80 + \u03a81 ,\nwhere\n2\n\u03ba\u03c1,\n3\n1\n= \u2212 fR0 R1 .\n2\n\nfR0 \u22072 \u03a80 =\n\n(24)\n\nfR0 \u22072 \u03a81\n\n(25)\n\nProvided that fR0 6= 0, Eq. (24) may be integrated via\nGauss's Law to give\n\u03a8\u20320 (r) =\n\n\u03ba m(r)\n,\n6\u03c0fR0 r2\n\n(26)\n\nwhere m(r) is the mass enclosed in a sphere of radius\nr. If we assume that \u03a80 vanishes as r \u2192 \u221e, we may\nintegrate Eq. (26) to obtain\n\u03a80 = \u2212\n\n\u03ba M\n,\n6\u03c0fR0 r\n\n(27)\n\noutside the star. Solving Eq. (25) outside the star using\nEq. (13) for R1 yields\n|\u03a81 | =\n\n1 \u03baM\n1\n\u03baM r \u226a\n,\n48\u03c0fRR0\nfR0 r\n\n(28)\n\nwhere the inequality follows from Eq. (18). Since \u03a80 \u223c\n\u03baM/(fR0 r) outside the star we have shown that |\u03a81 | \u226a\n\n|\u03a80 |. Therefore, we may neglect \u03a81 and conclude that\n\u03a8 = \u03a80 as given by Eq. (27). This expression for \u03a8 is\nused to define Newton's constant: G \u2261 \u03ba/(6\u03c0fR0 ). For\n1/R gravity with a static vacuum de Sitter background,\nfR0 = 4/3, so \u03ba takes its standard value of 8\u03c0G and\nEq. (27) matches the corresponding result in Ref. [15].\nWe now turn our attention to Eq. (21), which we will\nsolve for \u03a6. First, we note that Eq. (13) implies that\nR1\u2032 = \u2212R1 /r. Therefore, the ratio of the second two\nterms in Eq. (21) is\n(1/2)fR0 R1\nfR0 2\n\u223c\nr \u226a 1,\n2fRR0 R1\u2032 /r\nfRR0\n\n(29)\n\nwhere the inequality follows from Eq. (18). Consequently,\nthe fR0 R1 term is negligible, and we drop it from the\nequation. Differentiating Eq. (26) to find \u03a8\u2032\u2032 , and using\nGauss's Law to obtain R1\u2032 from Eq. (10) (with m2 = 0),\nwe may then rewrite Eq. (21) as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03ba\nd m(r)\n\u2032\n\u03a6 (r) =\n.\n(30)\n12\u03c0fR0 dr\nr\nAssuming that \u03a6 vanishes as r \u2192 \u221e, this equation may\nbe integrated to obtain\n\u03a6=\n\n\u03ba\nM\n,\n12\u03c0fR0 r\n\n(31)\n\noutside the star. It is easy to verify that Eqs. (27) and\n(31) also satisfy the third field equation, Eq. (22).\nWe may now check our assumption that R1 \u226a R0 for\nnonzero R0 . From the expression for R1 given by Eq. (13)\nand our definition that \u03ba \u2261 6\u03c0fR0 G, we see that\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 GM\nfR0\nR1\n<\n,\n(32)\n\u223c\nR0\nR0\nRs\nfRR0\nwhere Rs is the radius of the star. It is easy to check that\nthis expression holds inside the star as well by integrating\nEq. (10) into the interior of the star. Therefore, our\nassumption that R1 \u226a R0 places an additional condition\non the ratio fR0 /fRR0 :\n\u0012\n\u0013\nfR0\nRs\n\u226a R0\nfor R0 6= 0.\n(33)\nfRR0\nGM\nIf fR0 /fRR0 \u223c R0 , as is the case for many f (R) theories\nwith nonzero R0 , then this condition is always satisfied.\nThus we have shown explicitly that \u03a8 = \u22122\u03a6 =\n\u2212GM/r for all f (R) theories with nonzero fRR0 that satisfy the conditions given by Eqs. (5), (6), (16) and (33).\nTransforming the metric given by Eq. (9) to isotropic coordinates, taking a = 1 today, and keeping only terms\nthat are linear in GM/r gives\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2GM\n2\ndt2\nds = \u2212 1 \u2212\nr\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0003\nGM \u0002 2\n+ 1+\n(34)\ndr + r2 d\u03a92 .\nr\n\n\f5\nIt is clear that this spacetime is equivalent to a Parameterized Post-Newtonian spacetime with PPN parameter\n\u03b3 = 1/2. This result is in gross violation of observations;\nSolar System tests require that \u03b3 = 1 + (2.1 \u00b1 2.3) \u00d7 10\u22125\n[8, 9]. We also note that this result is in precise agreement\nwith the results obtained using the equivalent scalartensor theory [6] (see also [25]).\n\nIII.\n\nCASE STUDIES\n\nFirst, we show how we regain the results of general\nrelativity if we take fRR0 = 0 and assume that our linearized Taylor expansion is a valid approximation. We\nnote that general relativity [f (R) = R] satisfies both of\nthese conditions.\nTaking fRR0 = 0, Eq. (8) yields\nfR0 R1 = \u03ba\u03c1.\n\n(35)\n\nWhen fRR0 = 0, the fR0 R1 terms in the field equations\n[Eqs. (21-22)] are no longer negligible compared to the\nterms proportional to fRR0 since these terms vanish. The\nfield equations then become\n1\nfR0 \u22072 \u03a8 + fR0 R1 = \u03ba\u03c1,\n\u0012\n\u0013 2\n2 \u2032\n1\n\u2032\u2032\nfR0 \u2212\u03a8 + \u03a6 \u2212 fR0 R1 = 0,\nr\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 \u2032 1 \u2032\n1\n2\nfR0\n\u03a6 \u2212 \u03a8 + 2 \u03a6 \u2212 fR0 R1 = 0.\nr\nr\nr\n2\n\n(36)\n(37)\n\n\u03ba M\n.\n8\u03c0fR0 r\n\n(39)\n\n(40)\n\nFrom Eq. (37) and Eq. (38), we have\nfR0\n\u03ba\n\u2032\n(r\u03a6) = \u03c1,\n2\nr\n2\n\n(41)\n\nand the solution outside the star is\n\u03a6=\n\n\u03ba M\n= \u2212\u03a8.\n8\u03c0fR0 r\n\n(42)\n\nSince \u03a8 = \u2212\u03a6 = \u2212GM/r, transforming to isotropic coordinates reveals that \u03b3 = 1 as expected.\nWith this result it is easy to see why the \u03bc \u2192 0 limit in\n1/Rn (n > 0) gravity does not recover general relativity.\nIn 1/Rn gravity [3], we have\n\u03bc2+2n\n, n > 0.\nf (R) = R \u2212\nRn\n\n(m!)\u22121 f (m+1) (R0 )R1m\n<\n\u223c\nfR0 + fRR0 R1\n\n(43)\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0012\n\nGM\nr\nGM\nr\n\n\u0013m\n\u0013m\n\n\u226a 1,\n\n(44)\n\n\u226a 1,\n\n(45)\n\nso that Eqs. (5) and (6) are still satisfied. Furthermore,\nm2 \u221d R0 , so, as in the static-background case, the mass\nis of order the Hubble parameter today. Therefore, the\n\u03b3 = 1/2 result holds even during the late-time evolution\nof 1/Rn gravity.\nNext we consider Starobinsky gravity [5] which has\nf (R) = R +\n\nand the solution outside the star is\n\u03a8=\u2212\n\n(m!)\u22121 f (m) (R0 )R1m\n<\n\u223c\nf0 + fR0 R1\n\n(38)\n\nUsing Eq. (35), Eq. (36) becomes\n\u03ba\nfR0 \u22072 \u03a8 = \u03c1,\n2\n\nThe static solution to Eq. (3) with T cos = 0 is R0 = (n +\n2)1/(n+1) \u03bc2 , and fRR0 \u221d \u03bc\u22122 . Therefore, fRR0 diverges\nrather than vanishes in the limit that \u03bc \u2192 0, and general\nrelativity is not regained. The mass parameter for this\ntheory has the dependence m2 \u221d \u03bc2 and hence it vanishes\nin the limit that \u03bc \u2192 0. Furthermore, a Taylor series\nof Eq. (43) around R0 is well-behaved and cosmological\nconstraints tell us that \u03bc \u223c H so that m2 r2 \u226a 1 in the\nSolar System. We conclude that the analysis of general\nf (R) gravity given in Section II applies and \u03b3 = 1/2 for\nthese theories in a static background.\nWe note however that the static solution to Eq. (3)\nmay not describe the current cosmological background\nin 1/Rn gravity. This solution is unstable, and without\nfine-tuning of the initial conditions, this spacetime will\nevolve toward a spacetime with R0 \u226a \u03bc2 [3]. In that\ncase, we note that\n\nR2\n.\n\u03b12\n\n(46)\n\nThe static solution to Eq. (3) with T cos = 0 is R0 = 0\nfor this theory. Since f (R) is a second-order polynomial,\nthe first-order Taylor expansion of fR (R0 + R1 ) is exact.\nThe O(R12 ) term in the Taylor expansion of f (R0 + R1 )\nis suppressed compared to the linear term by a factor of\nGM/r and is therefore negligible. The mass parameter\nfor this theory is proportional to \u03b12 , so Eq. (13) is a\nsolution for R1 if \u03b12 r2 \u226a 1. Therefore, \u03b3 = 1/2 in\nthis theory if \u03b12 r2 \u226a 1 inside the Solar System. If the\nmass parameter \u03b1 is made large (i.e. if \u03b1 \u2243 1012 GeV as\nproposed in Ref. [5]), then this condition is not satisfied\nand we cannot use the analysis in Section II to calculate\n\u03b3 for this theory.\nNext we consider an example of a theory that uses two\nmass parameters: a hybrid between Starobinsky gravity\nand 1/R gravity. In particular, consider the function\nf (R) = R +\n\n1 2 \u03bc4\nR \u2212\n.\n\u03b12\nR\n\n(47)\n\nWe\nfind that, as in the usual 1/R case, we have R0 =\n\u221a then\n3\u03bc2 (for a static background in vacuum). However,\nm2 = 3\u03bc2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b12\n\u221a\n9\u03bc2 \u2212 3\u03b12\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(48)\n\n\f6\nWe can make this quantity as large as we want by letting the denominator tend towards zero, which gives the\ncondition \u03b1 \u2192 33/4 \u03bc. Thus, in this model we can violate the conditions listed in Section II by fine-tuning the\nparameters.\nFinally, we consider power-law gravitational actions\n[26]:\nf (R) =\n\n\u0012\n\nR\n\u03b1\n\n\u00131+\u03b4\n\n.\n\n(49)\n\nAssuming that \u03b4 6= 1, the static vacuum solution to\nEq. (3) is R0 = 0. If \u03b4 is not an integer, there will\nbe some derivative that is not defined at R = 0, which\ncauses the Taylor expansion to fail around that point. In\nparticular, if it is supposed that \u03b4 \u226a 1, then at least the\nsecond derivative will be undefined so that the Taylor expansion will fail. For \u03b4 = 1 the static vacuum background\nvalue R0 is undetermined. However, if we choose R0 6= 0\nthen all of the conditions listed in Section II are satisfied and we conclude that \u03b3 = 1/2 in agreement with\nRef. [27]. If \u03b4 is an integer greater than one, then the\nTaylor expansion around f (R0 = 0) is well-defined, but\nwe cannot drop the terms that are nonlinear in R1 since\nthe linearized function vanishes. Therefore, this analysis\nis incapable of determining whether f (R) = R1+\u03b4 gravity\nwith \u03b4 6= 1 conflicts with Solar System tests.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nBy analyzing the field equations around a spherically\nsymmetric mass, we have shown that, in agreement with\nthe analysis in Ref. [6], the PPN parameter \u03b3 of general\nf (R) gravity is \u03b3 = 1/2 given the following conditions:\nI. The Taylor expansions of f (R) and df /dR about\nthe current background value R = R0 , where R0 solves\nEq. (3), are well-defined and dominated by terms that\nare linear in deviations away from R = R0 . If R0 is nonzero, then the deviations from R0 are small compared\nto R0 . This condition may be re-expressed as Eq. (33)\nand is closely related to the third condition stated below.\nII. The second derivative of f (R) with respect to\nR is nonzero when evaluated at the background value of\nR = R0 .\nIII. The mass parameter given by Eq. (11) respects the\ncondition mr \u226a 1 within the Solar System.\n\nS=\n\n1\n2\u03ba\n\nZ\n\n\u0012\n\u221a\nd4 x \u2212gE RE \u2212\n\nFor theories with one extra mass parameter and\nnon-zero R0 , as in 1/R gravity, it is reasonable to\nassume that fR0 /fRR0 \u223c R0 . In that case, the latter\npart of the first condition is always true and the third\ncondition is satisfied provided that R0 r2 \u226a 1 within\nthe Solar System. However, for theories with multiple\nmass parameters, such as the Starobinsky-1/R hybrid\npresented in this paper, it is possible that this condition\ncan be violated.\nThe second and third conditions listed above correspond to synonymous conditions in the scalar-tensor\ntreatment: f (R) and scalar-tensor gravity are equivalent only if the second derivative of f (R) is nonzero,\nand \u03b3 = 1/2 only if the scalar field is light enough to\npropagate through the Solar System. Therefore, we have\nalso verified that, contrary to the claim of some authors\n[10, 11, 12, 13, 14], calculating the Solar System predictions of f (R) gravity using the equivalent scalar-tensor\ntheory is a valid technique.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nDuring the final preparations of this paper we learned\nof recent work along similar lines [28].

Therefore, we\nstress that this reformulation contains no new dynamics\ncompared to the expressions used in this paper. The two\nformulations are entirely equivalent.\nIn order to derive the mass m\u03c6 , we let \u03c6 = \u03c60 (t)+\u03c61 (r)\nand T M = T cos + T s so that \u03c60 (t) satisfies Eq.
