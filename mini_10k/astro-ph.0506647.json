Cheremushkinskaya, 25, Moscow 117259, Russia;\nAlexei.Aksenov@itep.ru\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nCompact astronomical objects identified with neutron stars, strange stars, and black\nholes are believed to be sources of electron-positron (e\u00b1 ) pairs that form in their vicinity by\ndifferent mechanisms and flow away. Among these objects are radio pulsars (Sturrock 1971,\nRuderman & Sutherland 1975, Arons 1981; Usov & Melrose 1996; Baring & Harding 2001),\naccretion-disc coronas of the Galactic X-ray binaries (White & Lightman 1989; Sunyaev et\nal. 1992), soft \u03b3-ray repeaters (Thompson & Duncan 1995; Usov 2001b), cosmological \u03b3-ray\nbursters (Eichler et al. 1989; Paczy\u0144ski 1990; Usov 1992), etc.. The estimated luminosity in\ne\u00b1 pairs varies greatly depending on the object and the specific conditions: from \u223c 1031 \u22121035\nergs s\u22121 or less for radio pulsars up to \u223c 1050 \u2212 1052 ergs s\u22121 in cosmological \u03b3-ray bursters.\nFor a wind out-flowing spherically from a surface of radius R there is a maximum\n(isotropic, unbeamed) pair luminosity beyond which the pairs annihilate significantly before\nthey escape (see Beloborodov 1999 and references therein). This is given by\nLmax\n\u00b1\n\n4\u03c0me c3 R\u03932\n=\n\u2243 1036 (R/106 cm)\u03932 ergs s\u22121 ,\n\u03c3T\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u0393 is the pair bulk Lorentz factor, and \u03c3T the Thomson cross section. When the\ninjected pair luminosity, L\u0303\u00b1 , greatly exceeds this value the emerging pair luminosity , L\u00b1\n, cannot significantly exceed Lmax\n\u00b1 ; in this case photons strongly dominate in the emerging\nmax\nemission: L\u00b1 . L\u00b1 \u226a L\u0303\u00b1 \u2243 L\u03b3 . Injected pair luminosities typical of cosmological \u03b3-ray\nbursts (e.g., Piran 2000), L\u0303\u00b1 \u223c 1050 \u2212 1052 ergs s\u22121 , greatly exceed Lmax\nfor their estimated\n\u00b1\n2\n\u0393\u00b1 \u223c 10 . For such a powerful wind the pair density near the source is very high, and\nthe out-flowing pairs and photons are nearly in thermal equilibrium almost up to the wind\nphotosphere (e.g., Paczy\u0144ski 1990). The outflow process of such a wind may be described\nfairly well by relativistic hydrodynamics (Paczy\u0144ski 1986, 1990; Goodman 1986; Grimsrud\n& Wasserman 1998; Iwamoto & Takahara 2002).\nIn contrast if L\u0303\u00b1 \u226a Lmax\nannihilation of the outflowing pairs is negligible. It is now\n\u00b1\ncommonly accepted that the magnetospheres of radio pulsars contain such a very rarefied\nultra-relativistic (\u0393\u00b1 \u223c 10 \u2212 102 ) pair plasma that is practically collisionless (see Melrose\n1995 for a review).\nRecently we described a numerical code and the results of calculations of spherically outflowing, non-relativistic (\u0393\u00b1 \u223c 1) pair winds with total luminosity in the range 1034 \u2212 1042\nergs s\u22121 , that is L \u223c (10\u22122 \u2212 106 )Lmax\n(Aksenov, Milgrom, & Usov 2004, hereafter Paper I).\n\u00b1\n(A brief account of the emerging emission from such a pair wind has been given by Aksenov\nMilgrom & Usov 2003.) While our numerical code can be more generally employed, the\nresults we presented in Paper I were for a hot, bare, strange star as the a wind injection\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nsource. Such stars are thought to be powerful sources of pairs created by the Coulomb barrier\nat the quark surface (Usov 1998, 2001a, see Fig. 1). For such luminosities it is not justified to\nassume thermal equilibrium, and so we have calculated the detailed microphysics including\nall two-body processes (ee \u2192 ee, \u03b3e \u2192 \u03b3e, e+ e\u2212 \u2194 \u03b3\u03b3) as well as their radiative three-body\nvariants (ee \u2194 ee\u03b3, \u03b3e \u2194 \u03b3e\u03b3, e+ e\u2212 \u2194 \u03b3\u03b3\u03b3). The relativistic kinetic Boltzmann equations\nfor pairs and photons were solved numerically to describe the time evolution and structure\nof pair winds and to find the emergent emission (we only presented results for stationary\nsituations). Gravity of the star was neglected, and it was assumed that only e\u00b1 pairs are\nemitted from the stellar surface. Thermal emission of photons from a bare quark surface,\nwhich has been neglected in Paper I, is strongly suppressed relative to black-body emission,\nbut not completely, (e.g., Cheng & Harko 2003; Jaikumar et al. 2004, see Fig. 1). Still,\nwhatever little is emitted may significantly affect the wind properties (see below).\nIn the present paper we extend our previous studies to also include the effects of gravity\nby solving the Boltzmann equations for pairs and photons in a Schwarzschild space-time\nappropriate for the strange star. We also include thermal emission of photons from the\nstellar surface.\nIn \u00a7 2 we formulate the equations that describe the pair wind and the boundary conditions. In \u00a7 3 we describe the computational method used to solve these equations. In \u00a7 4 we\npresent the results of our numerical simulations. Finally, in \u00a7 5, we discuss our results and\nsome potential astrophysical applications.\n\n2.\n\nFormulation of the problem\n\nWe consider an e\u00b1 pair wind that flows away from a hot, bare, unmagnetized, nonrotating, strange star. Space-time outside the star is described by Schwarzschild's metric\nwith the line element\nds2 = \u2212e2\u03c6 c2 dt2 + e\u22122\u03c6 dr 2 + r 2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 ) ,\n\n(2)\n\ne\u03c6 = (1 \u2212 rg /r)1/2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere\nis the lapse or redshift factor induced by gravity at a distance r from the stellar center,\nrg = 2GM/c2 \u2243 2.95 \u00d7 105 M/M\u2299 cm\nis the gravitational radius, with M the gravitational mass of the star.\n\n(4)\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nFollowing Page & Usov (2002) we consider, as a representative case, a strange star with\nM = 1.4M\u2299 which is constructed by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer- Volkoff equation of\nhydrostatic equilibrium using an equation of state for SQM as described in Alcock, Farhi,\n& Olinto (1986a) and in Haensel, Zdunik, & Schaefer (1986) [with a bag constant B =\n(140MeV)4 , QCD coupling constant \u03b1c \u2261 g 2 /4\u03c0 = 0.3, and the mass of strange quarks\nms = 150 MeV]. The circumferential radius of the star is R = 1.1 \u00d7 106 cm.\nWe assume that the temperature is constant over the surface of the star. The thermal\nemission in pairs and photons from the surface of strange quark matter (SQM) depends on\nthe surface temperature, TS , alone (Usov 1998, 2001a; Cheng & Harko 2003; Jaikumar et al.\n2004). The state of the plasma in the wind may be described by the distribution functions\nf\u00b1 (p, r, t) and f\u03b3 (p, r, t) for positrons (+), electrons (\u2212), and photons, respectively, where\np is the momentum of particles. There is no emission of nuclei from the stellar surface, so\nthe distribution functions of positrons and electrons are identical, f+ = f\u2212 .\nSince we fix the mass and radius of the central star the only remaining parameters that\ndetermine the wind are the surface temperature, which determines the pair injection rate\nand spectrum, and the photon surface radiation, which for default of better knowledge we\ntake to be thermal with a suppression factor, \u03b7, relative to black body; \u03b7 is our second\nfree parameter. Because of the very steep dependence of the pair injection rate on the\nsurface temperature, we actually use the former as a free parameter: in our calculations here\nL\u0303\u00b1 = 1034 , 1035 , ... , 1039 ergs s\u22121 .\n\n2.1.\n\nGeneral Relativistic Boltzmann Equations\n\nThe Boltzmann equations in a Schwarzschild background for either massless or massive\nparticles can be obtained as a special case from the results of Harleston & Holcomb (1991)\nand Harleston & Vishniac (1992).

Also, \u03b7\u0304iq is the emission coefficient for the production\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nof a particle of type i via the physical process labelled by q, and \u03c7qi is the corresponding\nabsorption coefficient.

This can provide exact conservation of energy on a finite computational grid (see below). Ei is the energy density in the\n{r, \u03bc, \u01eb} phase space.

The electric field in the elecrosphere is a few ten times\nhigher than the critical field, Ecr \u2243 1.3 \u00d7 1016 V cm\u22121 , at which the vacuum is unstable to\ncreation of e+ e\u2212 pairs (Schwinger 1951). Therefore, a hot, bare strange star is potentially\na powerful source of e+ e\u2212 pairs created in the electrosphere and flowing away from the star\n(Usov 1998). We use in our simulations a pair injection rate (Usov 2001a):\n\u1e44\u00b1in = 4\u03c0R2 F\u00b1 ,\n\n(10)\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nwhere\nF\u00b1 = 3 \u00d7 1042 exp (\u22120.593\u03b6)\n\u0015\nln(1 + 2\u03b6 \u22121)\n\u03c05\u03b6\n\u22122 \u22121\n\u00d7\n3 +\n4 cm s ,\n(1 + 0.074\u03b6)\n2(13.9 + \u03b6)\n\u0014\n\n(11)\n\nand \u03b6 = 20(TS /109 K)\u22121 . The energy spectrum of injected pairs is thermal with the surface\ntemperature TS , and their angular distribution is isotropic for 0 \u2264 \u03bc \u2264 1.\nThus, the pair injection luminosity, our first free parameter, is given by\nL\u0303\u00b1 = \u1e44\u00b1in [me c2 + (3/2)kB TS ] ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere kB is the Boltzmann constant (Usov 2001a). For the range we consider, L\u0303\u00b1 = 1034 \u2212\n1039 ergs s\u22121 , the surface temperature is in a rather narrow range, TS \u2243 (4 \u2212 6) \u00d7 108 K (see\nFig. 1).\nThermal emission of photons from the surface of a bare strange star is strongly suppressed if the surface temperature is not very high, TS \u226a 1011 K (Alcock et al. 1986a). The\nreason is that the plasma frequency of quarks in SQM is very large, ~\u03c9p \u2243 20 \u2212 25 MeV,\nand only hard photons with energies \u01eb\u03b3 > ~\u03c9p can propagate in the SQM. The luminosity\nin such hard photons, which are in thermodynamic equilibrium with quarks, decreases very\nfast for TS \u226a ~\u03c9p /kB (Chmaj, Haensel, & Slomi\u0144ski 1991; Usov 2001a) and in our case,\nwhere TS . 109 K, it is negligible (see Fig. 1). However, low-energy (\u01eb\u03b3 < ~\u03c9p ) photons may\nstill leave the SQM if they are produced by nonequilibrium processes in the surface layer of\nthickness \u223c c/\u03c9p \u223c 10\u221212 cm (Chmaj et al. 1991). The emissivity of SQM in nonequilibrium\nquark-quark bremsstrahlung radiation has been estimated by Cheng & Harko (2003) who\nfind that it is suppressed at least by a factor of 106 in comparison with black-body emission,\nL\u0303\u03b3 . 10\u22126 Lbb . Usov (2004) and Usov, Harko, & Cheng (2005) have recently considered a\nmodified model of the electrosphere taking into account surface effects for SQM . The modification of the electrosphere results in an increase in the density of electrons by a factor of\n\u223c 20\u221230 in comparison with the case when the surface effects are ignored. The electron density increase can additionally suppress the outgoing radiation from SQM in nonequilibrium\nquark-quark bremsstrahlung photons. In our simulations we take\nL\u0303\u03b3 = \u03b7 Lbb = \u03b7 4\u03c0\u03c3R2 TS4 ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03b7 is a dimensionless free parameter. We present results with \u03b7 = 0, 3 \u00d7 10\u22128 , 10\u22126 .\nIn default of better knowledge the photon spectrum is taken as black-body with the surface\ntemperature TS corresponding to L\u0303\u00b1 .\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nAn important parameter characterizing the affect of photon emission from the surface\non the out-flowing wind is the Eddington luminosity L\u00b1\nEdd for the pair plasma, above which\nthe radiation pressure force dominates over gravity,\n35\n\u22121\nL\u00b1\nEdd \u2243 10 (M/1.4M\u2299 ) ergs s .\n\n(14)\n\nWithin the narrow range of surface temperatures studied here, TS \u2243 (4 \u2212 6) \u00d7 108 K, we get\n\u00b1\n\u22126\n\u22128\n2\n3\n(see Fig. 1).\nL\u0303\u03b3 that is \u223c (1 \u2212 10)L\u00b1\nEdd for \u03b7 = 3 \u00d7 10 , and \u223c (10 \u2212 10 )LEdd for \u03b7 = 10\nThe stellar surface is assumed to be a perfect mirror for both e\u00b1 pairs and photons. At\nthe external boundary (r = rext ) pairs and photons escape freely from the studied region,\ni.e., the inward (\u03bc < 0) fluxes of both e\u00b1 pairs and photons vanish there.\n\n2.3.\n\nPhysical processes in the pair plasma\n\nAs the plasma moves outwards photons are produced by pair annihilation (e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3).\nOther two-body processes that occur in the outflowing plasma, and are included in the\nsimulations, are M\u00f8ller (e+ e+ \u2192 e+ e+ and e\u2212 e\u2212 \u2192 e\u2212 e\u2212 ) and Bhaba (e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 )\nscattering, Compton scattering (\u03b3e \u2192 \u03b3e), and photon-photon pair production (\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 ).\nTwo-body processes do not change the total number of particles in the system, and thus\ncannot in themselves lead to thermal equilibrium. So, we also include radiative processes\n(bremsstrahlung, double Compton scattering, and three-photon annihilation with their inverse processes), even though their cross-sections are at least \u223c \u03b1\u22121 \u223c 102 times smaller\nthan those of the two-body processes (\u03b1 = e2 /~c = 1/137 is the fine structure constant).\n\n3.\n\nThe computational method\n\nOur grid in the {r, \u03bc, \u01eb} phase-space is defined as follows. The r domain (R < r < rext )\nis divided into jmax spherical shells whose boundaries are designated with half integer indices.\nThe j shell (1 \u2264 j \u2264 jmax ) is between rj\u22121/2 and rj+1/2 , with \u2206rj = rj+1/2 \u2212 rj\u22121/2 (r1/2 = R\nand rjmax +1/2 = rext ).\nThe \u03bc-grid is made of kmax intervals \u2206\u03bck = \u03bck+1/2 \u2212 \u03bck\u22121/2 : 1 \u2264 k \u2264 kmax .\nThe energy grids for photons and electrons are both made of \u03c9max energy intervals\n\u2206\u01eb\u03c9 = \u01eb\u03c9+1/2 \u2212 \u01eb\u03c9\u22121/2 : 1 \u2264 \u03c9 \u2264 \u03c9max , but the lowest energy for photons is 0, while that for\npairs is me c2 .\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nThe quantities we compute are the energy densities averaged over phase-space cells\nZ\n1\nE d\u01eb d\u03bc r 2dr.\n(15)\nE\u03c9,k,j (t) =\n\u2206X \u2206\u01eb\u03c9 ,\u2206\u03bck ,\u2206rj\n3\n3\nwhere \u2206X = \u2206\u01eb\u03c9 \u2206\u03bck \u2206(rj3 )/3 and \u2206(rj3 ) = rj+1/2\n\u2212 rj\u22121/2\n.\n\nReplacing the space, angle, and energy derivatives in the Boltzmann equations (7) by\nfinite differences (e.g., Mezzacappa & Bruenn 1993) we have the following set of ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs) for E\u03c9,k,j specified on the computational grid:\ne\u2212\u03c6j dE\u03c9,k,j\n\u2206(r 2 \u03bck e2\u03c6 E\u03c9,k )j\n+ e\u2212\u03c6j \u03b2\u03c9\nc\ndt\n\u2206(rj3 )/3\n!\n\u001c \u001d\n\u2032\n\u03c6\n1\n\u2206(\u01eb\u03b2E\n)\nj\nk,j \u03c9\n\u2212\u03bck e\u03c6j \u03c6\u2032j\n\u2212 e\u03c6j\n\u2212\n\u03b2\u03c9\n\u2206\u01eb\u03c9\n\u03b2\u03c9\nr j\n\u2206 [(1 \u2212 \u03bc2 )E\u03c9,j ]k X q\n\u00d7\n=\n[\u03b7\u03c9,k,j \u2212 (\u03c7E)q\u03c9,k,j ],\n\u2206\u03bck\nq\nwhere\n\n\u001a\n\n1\nfor photons,\n2\n2 1/2\n[1 \u2212 (me c /\u01eb\u03c9 ) ]\nfor electrons,\n\u01eb\u03c9\u22121/2 + \u01eb\u03c9+1/2\n,\n\u01eb\u03c9 =\n2\n\u03bck\u22121/2 + \u03bck+1/2\n\u03bck =\n,\n2\nr1\u22121/2 + rj+1/2\nrj =\n.\n2\n\u03c6j = \u03c6(rj ) , \u03c6\u2032j = \u03c6\u2032 (rj )\n\u001c \u001d\n2\n2\n(rj+1/2\n\u2212 rj\u22121/2\n)/2\n1\n= 3\n,\n3\nr j\n(rj+1/2 \u2212 rj\u22121/2\n)/3\nZ\n1\nE(\u01eb, \u03bc, r)d\u01ebd\u03bc,\nE\u03c9,k (r) =\n\u2206\u01eb\u03c9 \u2206\u03bck \u2206\u01eb\u03c9 \u2206\u03bck\nZ\n3\nE\u03c9,j (\u03bc) =\nE(\u01eb, \u03bc, r)drd\u01eb,\n\u2206\u01eb\u03c9 \u2206rj3 \u2206\u01eb\u03c9 \u2206rj\nZ\n3\nE(\u01eb, \u03bc, r)drd\u03bc ,\nEk,j (\u01eb) =\n\u2206\u03bck \u2206rj3 \u2206\u03bck \u2206rj3\n\u03b2\u03c9 =\n\n(16)\n\n(17)\n(18)\n(19)\n(20)\n(21)\n(22)\n(23)\n(24)\n(25)\n\n2\n\u2206(r 2 \u03bck e2\u03c6 E\u03c9,k )j = rj+1/2\ne2\u03c6j+1/2 (\u03bck E\u03c9,k )r=rj+1/2\n2\n\u2212rj\u22121/2\ne2\u03c6j\u22121/2 (\u03bck E\u03c9,k )r=rj\u22121/2 ,\n\n(26)\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n\u2206 (\u01eb\u03b2Ek,j )\u03c9 = \u01eb\u03c9+1/2 \u03b2\u03c9+1/2 (Ek,j )\u03c9+1/2\n\u2212\u01eb\u03c9\u22121/2 \u03b2\u03c9\u22121/2 (Ek,j )\u03c9\u22121/2 ,\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u2206 (1 \u2212 \u03bc2 )E\u03c9,j k = (1 \u2212 \u03bc2k+1/2 )(E\u03c9,j )\u03bc=\u03bck+1/2\n\n\u2212(1 \u2212 \u03bc2k\u22121/2 )(E\u03c9,j )\u03bc=\u03bck\u22121/2 ,\n\n(Ek,j )\u03c9+1/2\n\n\uf8f1\nE\u03c9+1,k,j\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n(E\n\u2212E\n)(\u01eb\u03c9+1/2 \u2212\u01eb\u03c9+1 )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n,\n+ \u03c9+2,k,j \u01eb\u03c9+1,k,j\n\uf8f4\n\u2212\u01eb\n\u03c9+2\n\u03c9+1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u03bc\u22650\n=\nE\u03c9,k,j\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n(E\n\u2212E\n)(\u01eb\u03c9+1/2 \u2212\u01eb\u03c9 )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n+ \u03c9,k,j \u03c9\u22121,k,j\n,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u01eb\n\u2212\u01eb\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\u22121\n\uf8f3\n\u03bc < 0,\n\n(27)\n\n(28)\n\n(29)\n\n(E\u03c9,j )\u03bc=\u03bck+1/2 = E\u03c9,k,j\n\n+\n\n\u2206\u03bck (E\u03c9,k,j \u2212 E\u03c9,k\u22121,j )\n,\n\u2206\u03bck\u22121 + \u2206\u03bck\n\n(\u03bck E\u03c9,k )r=rj+1/2 = (1 \u2212 \u03c7\u0303\u03c9,k,j+1/2)\n\u0011\n\u0010 \u03bc + |\u03bc |\n\u03bck \u2212 |\u03bck |\nk\nk\nE\u03c9,k,j +\nE\u03c9,k,j+1\n\u00d7\n2\n2\nE\u03c9,k,j + E\u03c9,k,j+1\n+\u03c7\u0303\u03c9,k,j+1/2\u03bck\n,\n2\n\u03c7\u0303\u22121\n\u03c9,k,j+1/2 = 1 +\n\n1\n\u03c7\u03c9,k,j \u2206rj\n\n+\n\n1\n.\n\u03c7\u03c9,k,j \u2206rj+1\n\n(30)\n\n(31)\n\n(32)\n\nThe dimensionless coefficient \u03c7\u0303 is introduced to describe correctly both optically thin and\noptically thick computational cells by means of a compromise between the high order method\nand the monotonic transport scheme without the artificial viscosity (e.g., Richtmeyer &\nMorton 1967; Mezzacappa & Bruenn 1993; Aksenov 1998).

In the general relativistic scheme developed in this paper we were not able\nto achieve exact number conservation. However, in all runs for a stationary solution the\nchange of the particle flux due to computational effects is at most a few percents. Energy\nconservation is still exactly satisfied.\nThere are several characteristic times in the system. Some are related to particle reaction\ntimes, some to the time to reach steady state. These times may greatly differ from each\nother, especially at high luminosities (& 1038 ergs s\u22121 ) when the pair wind is optically thick.\nThe set of equations (16) is then stiff: at least some eigenvalues of the Jacobi matrix differ\nsignificantly from each other, and the real parts of the eigenvalues are negative. In contrast to\nMezzacappa & Bruenn (1993) we use Gear's method (Hall & Watt 1976) to solve the ODEs\nfinite differences analog (16) of the Boltzmann equations. This high-order, implicit method\nwas developed especially to find a solution of stiff sets of ODE. To solve a system of linear\nalgebraic equations at any time step of Gear's method we use the cyclic reduction method\n(Mezzacappa & Bruenn 1993). The number of operations per time step is \u221d (\u03c9max kmax )3 jmax ,\nwhich increases rapidly with the increase of \u03c9max and kmax . Therefore, the numbers of energy\nand angle intervals have to be rather limited in our simulations.\nHere we use an (\u01eb, \u03bc, r)-grid with \u03c9max = 13, kmax = 8, and jmax = 100. The discrete\nenergies (in keV) of the \u01eb-grid minus the rest mass of the particles are 0, 2, 27, 111, 255, 353,\n436, 491, 511, 530, 585, 669, 766, and \u221e. This gives a denser grid at low energies and near\nthe threshold of pair production, \u01eb = me c2 . The \u03bc-grid is uniform, with \u2206\u03bck = 2/kmax = 1/4.\nThe shell thicknesses are geometrically spaced: \u2206r1 = 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 cm, and \u2206rj = 1.3\u2206rj\u22121 .\nTo check the effects of grid coarseness we also performed test computations with kmax = 4\nand 6, and separately with \u03c9max = 10 and 11. We did not observe changes in the results.\n\n4.\n\nNumerical results\n\nIn this section, we give the results for the properties of spherically symmetric winds\nconsisting of e\u00b1 pairs and photons. The pair injection luminosity L\u0303\u00b1 and \u03b7 are the parameters\nin our simulations. The photon injection luminosity L\u0303\u03b3 is determined by equation (13) where\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nthe surface temperature TS relates to the value of L\u0303\u00b1 [see equations (10) - (12)]. We start from\nan empty wind, injecting both pairs at a rate 1034 ergs s\u22121 and photons at a corresponding\nrate. After a steady state is reached we start a new run with this steady state as initial\ncondition, increase the energy injection rate in pairs by a factor of 10, wait for steady state,\nand so on.\nWe next present the results for the structure of the stationary winds and their emergent\nemission at the external boundary.\nFigure 2 shows the mean optical depth \u03c4\u03b3 (r) for photons, from r to rext . The wind as a\nwhole is optically thick [\u03c4\u03b3 (R) > 1] for L\u0303\u00b1 & 1037 ergs s\u22121 irrespective of \u03b7. For L\u0303\u00b1 = 1039\nergs s\u22121 the radius of the wind photosphere rph , determined by condition \u03c4 (rph ) = 1, is\n\u223c 4 \u00d7 106 cm (see Fig. 2). The wind photosphere is always deep inside our chosen external\nboundary (rph \u226a rext ), justifying our neglect of the inward (\u03bc < 0) fluxes at r = rext .\nFigures 3 and 4 show the pair number density (ne ) and the bulk velocity of the pair\nplasma ouflow (veout ), respectively, as functions of the distance from the stellar surface. For\nhigh luminosities (L\u0303\u00b1 & 1037 ergs s\u22121 ) both these quantities hardly depend on \u03b7, i.e., the\npair wind structure is determined only by L\u0303\u00b1 . For low luminosities (L\u0303\u00b1 . 1035 ergs s\u22121 ),\nne and veout depend significantly on \u03b7. In particular, for L\u0303\u00b1 = 1034 ergs s\u22121 near the stellar\nsurface (r \u2212 R . 105 cm) the pair density for \u03b7 = 0 is \u223c 6 times higher than for \u03b7 = 10\u22126 ,\nwhile the velocity of the pair plasma is \u223c 6 times smaller. This is because for a surface\ntemperature TS \u2243 4 \u00d7 108 K, which corresponds to L\u0303\u00b1 = 1034 ergs s\u22121 , the mean kinetic\nenergy of pairs near the surface, (3/2)kB TS \u2243 8.3\u00d710\u22128 ergs is about half of the gravitational\nbinding energy, so an atmosphere may form. In addition, for low surface photon luminosities\n(\u03b7 . a few \u00d7 10\u22128 ) radiation pressure is too weak to suppress the plasma atmosphere that\nresults from the presence of gravity. So, an atmosphere does form, and, in turn, is conducive\nto pair annihilation. In contradistinction for \u03b7 = 10\u22126 radiation pressure does suppress the\nformation of an atmosphere, and the pair wind structure, i.e., the runs of ne (r) and veout (r),\nis very similar to the case with no gravity and \u03b7 = 0.\nFigure 5 shows the rates of outflow of e\u00b1 pairs (\u1e44\u00b1 ) and photons (\u1e44\u03b3 ) through the\nsurface as functions of r. For high luminosities (L\u0303\u00b1 & 1037 ergs s\u22121 ) the rate of pair outflow\n\u1e44\u00b1 almost doesn't depend on \u03b7 and decreases significantly at the distance\n!\u22121\nL\u0303\u00b1\nlann \u2243 10\ncm\n(35)\n1039 ergs s\u22121\nfrom the stellar surface because of pair annihilation (see the estimate of lann in Paper I). For\nlow luminosities (L\u0303\u00b1 . 1035 ergs s\u22121 ) the dependence of \u1e44\u00b1 on r is different for different\nvalues of \u03b7. For \u03b7 = 0 the value of \u1e44\u00b1 decreases outwards at least by a factor of 2 even when\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nL\u0303\u00b1 is as small as 1034 ergs s\u22121 , while for \u03b7 = 10\u22126 the decrease of \u1e44\u00b1 due to pair annihilation\nis very small for low luminosities, again reflecting the degree to which a pair atmosphere is\nformed.\nThe photon outflow rate is seen to increase with increasing r not only because of pair\nannihilation, but also because of accumulative production of photons by radiative three-body\nprocesses. These processes are important for high luminosities (L\u0303\u00b1 & 1038 ergs s\u22121 ) and are\nresponsible for the increase of \u1e44\u03b3 at r \u2212 R \u223c 103 \u2212 105 cm for such high luminosities (see\nFig. 5).\nThe rates of energy outflow in e\u00b1 pairs (\u0116\u00b1 ) and photons (\u0116\u03b3 ) vary with radius more\nor less similarly to the particle outflow rates, except that the total energy rate is explicitly\nconserved in all processes (see Fig. 6). The total energy rate decreases with increase of r\nbecause of the gravity effects,\n\u0116(r) = \u0116\u00b1 (r) + \u0116\u03b3 (r) = e2(\u03c6\u0303\u2212\u03c6) L\u0303 =\n\n1 \u2212 rg /R\nL\u0303 ,\n1 \u2212 rg /r\n\n(36)\n\nand varies from L\u0303 = L\u0303\u00b1 + L\u0303\u03b3 at r = R to the total emerging luminosity\nL = L\u00b1 + L\u03b3 = \u0116(rext ) =\n\n1 \u2212 rg /R\nL\u0303\n1 \u2212 rg /rext\n\n(37)\n\nat r = rext . This differs qualitatively from Paper I where the gravity effects are ignored, and\n\u0116(r) is constant.\nThe number rates of emerging pairs (\u1e44\u00b1 ) as functions of L\u0303\u00b1 for different values of \u03b7\nare shown in Figure 7. For L\u0303\u00b1 = 1034 ergs s\u22121 the value of \u1e44\u00b1 for \u03b7 = 0 is \u223c 3 times\nsmaller than the same for \u03b7 = 10\u22126 . The results of our new simulations for \u03b7 = 10\u22126 and\nour old simulations with \u03b7 = 0 and no gravity practically coincide. This is consistent with\nour results on the wind structure. For L\u0303\u00b1 & 1037 ergs s\u22121 \u1e44\u00b1 hardly depends on \u03b7, and\nis \u223c 1.5 \u2212 2 times smaller than the result of Paper I (see Fig. 7). This is due to partial\nsuppression of pair creation as the photon energies are reduced by gravitational redshift.\nFigure 8 shows the emerging total luminosities in e\u00b1 pairs (L\u00b1 , including the rest mass)\nand photons (L\u03b3 )\u2013given as fractions of the total emerging luminosity L = L\u00b1 + L\u03b3 \u2013as functions of the injection luminosity, and for different values of \u03b7. For the luminosity range we\nconsider photons dominate in the emerging emission (L\u03b3 > L\u00b1 ), especially at high luminosities where L\u03b3 \u226b L\u00b1 .\nFigure 9 presents the energy spectra of the emerging photons for different values of\nL\u0303\u00b1 and \u03b7. For low luminosities (L\u0303\u00b1 . 1036 ergs s\u22121 ) and \u03b7 = 0, photons, which form by\npair annihilation, escape more or less freely from the star's vicinity, and the photon spectra\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nrepresent a very wide annihilation line that is redshifted in the gravitational field. The mean\nenergy of the emerging photons varies from \u223c 430 keV for L\u0303\u00b1 = 1034 ergs s\u22121 to 400 keV\nfor L\u0303\u00b1 = 3 \u00d7 1036 ergs s\u22121 (see Fig. 10). If \u03b7 is near its maximum value (\u223c 10\u22126 ) there is\nno annihilation line in the spectra of emerging photons. Annihilation photons only modify\nthese spectra by producing high-energy tails (see Fig. 9c). For high luminosities (L\u0303\u00b1 & 1038\nergs s\u22121 ) the energy spectra of emerging photons practically don't depend on \u03b7 and coincide\nwith the results of Paper I.\n\n5.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe have identified certain characteristics of pair winds outflowing from hot, bare, strange\nstars and their emerging emission. For the energy injection rate in pairs we consider (L\u0303\u00b1 =\n1034 \u2212 1039 ergs s\u22121 ) photons dominate in the emerging emission (see Fig. 8.). The spectrum\nof the emerging photons, we find, is rather hard (see Figs. 9 and 10) and differs qualitatively\nfrom the spectrum of the thermal emission from a neutron star with the same luminosity\n(e.g., Romani 1987; Shibanov et al. 1992; Rajagopal & Romani 1996; Page et al. 2004). In\nparticular, for a bare strange star the mean energy of the emerging photons (see Fig. 10)\nis at least an order of magnitude larger than the same for a neutron star. This opens\nobservational possibilities to distinguish strange stars from neutron stars. Hard spectra of\nbare strange stars are amenable to detection and study by sensitive, hard X-ray and soft\n\u03b3-ray instruments, such as INTEGRAL (e.g., Winkler et al. 2003).\nIn this study we take into account both the thermal emission of photons from the strange\nstar surface and gravity that have been neglected in Paper I. We have shown that for low\nvalues of \u03b7 . a few \u00d7 10\u22128 and L\u0303\u00b1 . 1035 ergs s\u22121 pairs emitted by the stellar surface are\nmainly captured by the gravitational field, and a pair atmosphere forms. The probability\nof pair annihilation increases because of the increase of the pair number density in the\natmosphere, and this results in decrease of the fraction of pairs in the emerging emission in\ncomparison with the case of Paper I (see Figs. 7 and 8). However, if the surface emission\nin photons is as high as its upper limit (\u03b7 \u2243 10\u22126 ) radiation pressure forces dominate over\ngravity, and the pair wind structure practically coincides with the results for no gravity,\nirrespective of L\u0303\u00b1 .\nThe dominant physical processes in pair winds change significantly depending on L\u0303\u00b1 .\nFor L\u0303\u00b1 < L\u2217 \u2243 1037 ergs s\u22121 the optical depth for photons is smaller than unity, \u03c4\u03b3 < 1 (see\nFig. 2). In this case some part of e\u00b1 pairs ejected from the stellar surface annihilates into\nphotons in the process of their outflow, while photo-creation of pairs is rather rare. Above\nL\u0303\u00b1 \u2243 L\u2217 pair creation by photons becomes important, and for L\u0303\u00b1 \u226b L\u2217 the rates of pair\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\ncreation and pair annihilation are more or less comparable at lann . r \u2212 R \u226a rph . At such\ndistances from the surface the number density of pairs is nearly constant (see Fig. 3 and\nFig. 8 in Paper I). In addition, for high luminosities (L\u0303\u00b1 & 1038 ergs s\u22121 ) radiative threebody processes are important, and the total rate of the particle outflow increases with radius\n(see Fig. 5). These processes favour thermalization of pairs and photons in the outflow.\nFor low luminosities (L\u0303\u00b1 < L\u2217 ) the spectrum of emerging photons significantly depends\non the photo-emission from the surface, especially at low energies, \u01eb\u03b3 \u226a me c2 (see Fig. 9). If\nsurface photo-emission is negligible (\u03b7 = 0), this spectrum resembles a very wide annihilation\nline. The fractional emerging luminosity in the annihilation line decreases with the increase\nof \u03b7. For \u03b7 = 10\u22126 the annihilation line is completely washed out, and a high-energy part\nof this line is observed as a high-energy tail (see Fig. 9c). For high luminosities (L\u0303\u00b1 & 1038\nergs s\u22121 ) the spectrum of emerging photons is practically independent of the photon emission\nfrom the stellar surface.\nSoft \u03b3-ray repeaters (SGRs), which are the sources of short bursts of hard X-rays with\nsuper-Eddington luminosities (up to \u223c 1042 \u2212 1047 ergs s\u22121 ), are potential candidates for\nstrange stars (e.g., Alcock et al. 1986b; Cheng & Dai 1998; Usov 2001c; Ouyed et al. 2005).\nThe bursting activity of SGRs may be explained by fast heating of the stellar surface up to\na temperature of \u223c (1 \u2212 3) \u00d7 109 K and its subsequent thermal emission (Usov 2001b,c).\nThe heating mechanism may be either impacts of comets onto bare strange stars (Zhang\net al. 2000; Usov 2001b) or fast decay of superstrong (\u223c 1014 \u2212 1015 G) magnetic fields\n(Thompson & Duncan 1995; Heyl & Kulkarni 1998). Since for high luminosities (& 1038\nergs s\u22121 ) the spectrum of emerging photons practically doesn't depend on the surface photoemission, which is poorly known, it is possible to calculate more securely many properties\n(light curves, energy spectra, etc.) of powerful (L \u226b 1038 ergs s\u22121 ) X-ray bursts expected\nfrom the stellar surface heating neglecting surface photo-emission. We plan to apply the\ntools developed here to study these problems.\nWe thank members of the Israeli Center for High Energy Astrophysics, D. Eichler, A.\nLevinson, T. Piran, and E.
