We discuss the value distribution of quasimeromorphic mappings in\nRn with given behavior in a neighborhood of an essential singularity.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 30D45. Secondary\n30C65.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn this paper we study some value distribution properties of K-quasimeromorphic\nmappings in Rn , n \u2265 2, with an essential singularity at infinity and given asymptotic\nbehavior. We also consider the mutual arrangement of a-points of K-quasimeromorphic\nmappings under certain conditions. In particular, we consider Yosida type quasimeromorphic mappings (cf. [12]). This class of mappings was mentioned in [1, Lemma\n1], [6], but as far as we know, no further study was carried out. We prove that\nn-periodic K-quasimeromorphic mappings [5] are Yosida mappings.\n1.1 PRELIMINARIES. In general, we follow the notation and terminology\nof [11]. The Euclidean distance is denoted by |x\u2212y| for x, y \u2208 Rn , and the one-point\nn\ncompactification of Rn is denoted by R and, as usual, identified with the Riemann\nn\nsphere S n ( 21 en+1 , 12 ), [11, p. 4]. The chordal distance q(a, b) for a, b \u2208 R is defined\nby\nq(a, b) = p\n\n|a \u2212 b|\np\n,\n1 + |a|2 1 + |b|2\n\nif\n\na, b \u2208 Rn ,\n\nand q(a, \u221e) = p\n\n1\n1 + |a|2\n\n.\n\nFurther let Bp (a, r) = {x \u2208 Rn : |x \u2212 a| < r|a|2\u2212p }, where a \u2208 Rn \\ {0}, p \u2265 1 and\nr > 0, and B2 (a, r) = B(a, r).\n1.2 NORMAL FAMILIES AND YOSIDA MAPPINGS.\nHere norn\nmality of a family of mappings in a domain D \u2286 R means uniform continuity of\nthe family in the spherical metric q(., .) on compact subsets of D.\nWe consider the case of families of K-quasimeromorphic mappings in Rn with\nessential singularity at infinity only.\nA family F = {f } of K-quasimeromorphic mappings of a domain D \u2286 Rn is\ncalled normal on D if every sequence {fn } \u2208 F has a subsequence that converges\nuniformly on compact subsets of D with respect to the spherical metric q.\nThe criteria for normality of a family of K-quasimeromorphic mappings, proved\nby R. Miniowitz [6], can be formulated for D \u2286 Rn as follows\n1.3. THEOREM. A family F = {f } of K-quasimeromorphic mappings in\na domain D in Rn is normal if and only if for every compact subset G of D there\nexists a number MG such that\nq(f (x1 ), f (x2 )) \u2264 MG |x1 \u2212 x2 |\u03b1\n1\n\n(1.4)\n\n\ffor each x1 \u2208 G, x2 \u2208 D and f \u2208 F where \u03b1 = K 1/(1\u2212n) .\nLet\nQf (x) = lim sup\n|h|\u21920\n\nq(f (x + h), f (x))\n.\n|h|\u03b1\n\nThen we can rewrite condition (1.4) in the form\nsup sup Qf (x) \u2264 MG < \u221e .\n\n(1.5)\n\nf \u2208F x\u2208G\n\nA.Ostrowski [8] applied the technique of normal families of meromorphic functions for investigation of the value distribution of meromorphic functions f forming\nnormal families {f (2n z)} on C \\ {0} (see also Montel's monograph [7]). J.Heinonen\n- J.Rossi [3] and P.J\u00e4rvi [4] generalized these results on the case of exceptional Kquasimeromorphic mappings in the sense of Julia and described these mappings in\nterms of cercles de remplissage.\nK.Yosida [12] considered a classification of meromorphic functions on the complex\nplane C based on normality of a family of functions of the form {f (z +a)}, a \u2208 C, on\nC. The paper [13] of L. Zalcman is a review of normal families of analytic functions.\nWe define a class of Yosida K-quasimeromorphic mappings in Rn and describe\nthe distribution of a-points for these mappings.\nn\n\n1.6. Definition.\nA K-quasimeromorphic mapping f : Rn \u2192 R is a Yosida\nK-quasimeromorphic mapping in Rn if the family of mappings {f (x + a)}, a \u2208 Rn ,\nis normal in Rn .\nThe next result follows from Theorem 1.3 with condition (1.5).\nn\n\n1.7.

THEOREM. Let p > 1 and f be a K-quasimeromorphic mapping in\nR . Then f is a p-Yosida mapping; that is, f satisfies (1.9), if and only if the family\nof mappings {f (a + |a|2\u2212p x)}, a \u2208 Rn \\ {0}, is normal in Rn .\nn\n\nLet {an } be an arbitrary sequence of points in Rn with lim |an | = \u221e, and let\nn\u2192\u221e\nf be a p-Yosida mapping in Rn , p > 1. Without loss of generality we may suppose\nthat the sequence of mappings {f (an + |an |2\u2212p x)} converges uniformly to a mapping\ng(x) on compact subsets of Rn .\nObviously, for every Yosida K-quasimeromorphic mapping f , non-constant limit\nmappings g of converging sequences of the form {f (x + an )} are Yosida mappings.\n1.11. THEOREM. Let p > 1 and let f be a p-Yosida mapping in Rn . Then\nnon-constant limit mappings of sequences of the form {f (an + |an |2\u2212p x)}, where\nlim |an | = \u221e, are Yosida K-quasimeromorphic mappings.\nn\u2192\u221e\n\na\n, a 6= 0, and f be a p-Yosida K-quasimeromorphic mapping\nProof. Let ea = |a|\nn\nin R , p > 1. Then for every sequence of points {an }, an \u2208 Rn \\ {0}, lim |an | = \u221e,\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nthe sequence of mappings {f (an + |an |2\u2212p x)} converges uniformly to a mapping g\non compact subsets of Rn , and for every fixed x \u2208 Rn\nq(g(y), g(x))\ny\u2192x\n|y \u2212 x|\u03b1\n\nQg (x) = lim\n\u2264 lim lim sup\ny\u2192x\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nq(fn (y), fn (x))\n|y \u2212 x|\u03b1\n\nq(f (an + |an |2\u2212p y), f (an + |an |2\u2212p x))\n= lim lim sup\n|an |(2\u2212p)\u03b1\n\u03b1\n(2\u2212p)\u03b1\ny\u2192x n\u2192\u221e\n|y \u2212 x| |an |\n\u2264 lim sup Qf (an + |an |2\u2212p x)|an |(2\u2212p)\u03b1\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n= lim sup Qf (an + |an |\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n2\u2212p\n\nx)|an + |an |\n\n2\u2212p\n\nx|\n\n(2\u2212p)\u03b1\n\n|an |(2\u2212p)\u03b1\n|an + |an |2\u2212p x|(2\u2212p)\u03b1\n\n\u2264 Qf lim sup |ean + |an |1\u2212p x|(p\u22122)\u03b1 .\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nSince p > 1 and x belongs to a compact subset G \u2282 Rn , the last limit is bounded.\nThe boundedness of Qg yields that g is a Yosida K-quasimeromorphic mapping.\n1.12. Remark. If p = 1 then we have the class of exceptional K-quasimeromorphic\nmappings in the sense of Julia (see [3] and [4]). This kind of mappings form a normal\nfamily of mappings {f (rn x)} on Rn \\ {0} for any sequence of positive numbers {rn },\nlim rn = \u221e.\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n3\n\n\fCercles de remplissage and M -sequences\n\n2\n\nS. Rickman [10] proved that for every integer n \u2265 2 and each K \u2265 1 a non-constant\nK-quasimeromorphic mapping f in Rn can have at most l(n, K) exceptional values\nwhere l(n, K) \u2265 2.\n2.1. Definition. Let p \u2265 1. A sequence {xm } in Rn , lim |xm | = \u221e, is called\nm\u2192\u221e\na Mp -sequence for a non-constant K-quasimeromorphic mapping f in Rn if for each\nsubsequence {xmk } and each \u03b4 > 0 the mapping f takes all but possibly l = l(n, K)\n\u221e\nS\nn\nBp (xmk , \u03b4).\nvalues from R infinitely often in\nk=1\n\nFor further investigation we should determine a weighted distance dp (X, Y ) between two sequences of points X = {xm } and Y = {ym} in Rn \\ {0}, where\nlim |xm | = \u221e and lim |ym | = \u221e. Let\n\nm\u2192\u221e\n\nm\u2192\u221e\n\n|xm \u2212 yk |\n,\nk,m |xm |2\u2212p\n\n|yk \u2212 xm |\n.\nk,m |yk |2\u2212p\n\nDp (X, Y ) = inf\n\nDp (Y, X) = inf\n\n2.2. LEMMA. Let p \u2265 1. For any two sequences of points X = {xm } and\nY = {ym } in Rn \\ {0} with lim |xm | = \u221e and lim |ym | = \u221e, either Dp (X, Y ) and\nm\u2192\u221e\n\nm\u2192\u221e\n\nDp (Y, X) both are zero or both are non-zero.\nProof. Indeed, if Dp (X, Y ) = 0, that is, there are subsequences of points {xmj }\nand {ykj } that satisfy the conditions\n|xmj \u2212 ykj | < \u03b5j |xmj |2\u2212p ,\nThen\n\nwhere \u03b5j \u2192 0\n\nas j \u2192 0.\n\n|xmj \u2212 ykj |\n|xmj |2\u2212p\n|xmj \u2212 ykj | |xmj |2\u2212p\n=\n\u2264\n\u03b5\nj\n|ykj |2\u2212p\n|xmj |2\u2212p |ykj |2\u2212p\n|ykj |2\u2212p\n\n.\n\nSince p \u2265 1 we see that\n||xmj |2\u2212p \u2212 |ykj |2\u2212p | \u2264 M||xmj | \u2212 |ykj || \u2264 M|xmj \u2212 ykj | < \u03b5j |xmj |2\u2212p\nThis inequality implies that 1 \u2212\n\n.\n\n|ykj |2\u2212p\n< \u03b5j . According to the last estimate\n|xmj |2\u2212p\n\n|xmj | \u223c |ykj | eventually, i.e.\n||xmj | \u2212 |ykj || < \u03b5j |xmj |2\u2212p \u2264 \u03b5\u0302j |ykj |2\u2212p .\nThus we conclude that Dp (X, Y ) = 0 implies Dp (Y, X) = 0 as well.\nFor two sequences of points X and Y in Rn \\ {0} set\ndp (X, Y ) = min{Dp (X, Y ), Dp (Y, X)} .\n4\n\n\f2.3. THEOREM. Let p > 1 and f be a K-quasimeromorphic mapping in\nRn , n \u2265 2. A sequence of points {xm } in Rn , lim |xm | = \u221e, is a Mp -sequence for\nm\u2192\u221e\n\nn\n\nf if and only if for each c \u2208 R there is a sequence of points {x\u2032m } in Rn such that\ndp ({xm }, {x\u2032m }) = 0 and lim q(f (x\u2032m ), c) = 0.\nm\u2192\u221e\n\nProof. Necessity. If {xm } is a Mp -sequence for f then for each k > 0 there is a\nfinite number of points xm such that the image of the balls Bp (xm , k1 ) is spherically\nn\nbounded away from the point c \u2208 R by the distance k1 . That is, for each k > 0\nthere is a number mk such that for each m > mk there is a point x\u2032m \u2208 Bp (xm , k1 )\nwith q(f (x\u2032m ), c) < k1 . For m \u2264 m1 we take x\u2032m = xm , and for mk < m \u2264 mk+1\nlet x\u2032m be as above. The sequence of points {x\u2032m } is then \"p-closed\" to {xm }, i.e. ,\n|xm \u2212 x\u2032m |\n= 0, and q(f (x\u2032m ), c) \u2192 0 as m \u2192 \u221e.\nlim\nm\u2192\u221e |xm |2\u2212p\nSufficiency. We take sequences of points {x\u2032k } and {xk } in Rn such that\ndp (x\u2032k , xk ) \u2192 0 as k \u2192 \u221e but qp (f (x\u2032k ), f (xk )) 9 0 as k \u2192 \u221e\nat the same time. Consider a family of mappings F = {f (xk + |xk |2\u2212p x)}. By our\nassumption the family F is not equicontinuous in the neighborhood of the origin.\nTherefore, for each r > 0 the family F is not normal in the ball Br = {x \u2208 Rn , |x| \u2264\nr} (see [11]). By Theorem 4 [6], the family F takes infinitely often all but possibly\nn\nl(n, K) values from R in the ball Br . Therefore the mapping f takes infinitely\n\u221e\nS\nn\nBp (xk , r).\noften all but possibly l(n, K) values from R in the union of balls\nk=1\n\nSince the mentioned argument is valid for all r > 0 and each subsequence {xk } we\ncan conclude that {xm } is a Mp -sequence for f .\n2.4.\n\nCOROLLARY.\n\nIf {xm } in Rn with lim |xm | = \u221e, is a Mp -sequence\nm\u2192\u221e\n\nfor a mapping f in Rn then a sequence {ym } in Rn satisfying the condition of\n|xm \u2212 ym |\ncloseness lim\n= 0 is also Mp -sequence for f .\nm\u2192\u221e |ym |2\u2212p\n2.5. Definition. Let p \u2265 1. A sequence {xm } in Rn with lim |xm | = \u221e,\nm\u2192\u221e\nis called \u03bcp -sequence for a K-quasimeromorphic mapping f if there exist monotone\ndecreasing sequences of positive numbers {Lm }, lim Lm = 0, and {rm }, lim rm =\nm\u2192\u221e\n\nm\u2192\u221e\n\n0, such that the image of each ball Bp (xm , rm ), m = 1, 2, . . . , covers the sphere S n\nexcept possibly l(n, K) sets Ej , j = 1, . . . , l(n, K), whose spherical diameters do not\nexceed Lm .\n2.6. Remark. The concepts of Mp -sequence and \u03bcp -sequence for meromorphic\nfunctions on the complex plane C were introduced by V.Gavrilov in [2].\n2.7. LEMMA. A sequence of points {xm } \u2208 Rn , lim |xm | = \u221e, is a \u03bcp m\u2192\u221e\nsequence for a K-quasimeromorphic mapping f in Rn , p > 1, if and only if for each\nr > 0 there exist sets Ej (r, m) \u2208 S n , j = 1, . . . , l(n, K), such that the spherical\ndiameter of the sets do not exceed r, and N(r) is such that the mapping f takes in\nn\nevery ball Bp (xm , r) = {x \u2208 Rn , |x \u2212 xm | < r|xm |2\u2212p }, m \u2265 N, all values from R\nexcept possibly the sets Ej (r, m), j = 1, . . . , l(n, K).\n5\n\n\fProof. The proof of necessity follows from the definition of \u03bcp -sequence.\nSufficiency. Let {xm } be a sequence that satisfies the conditions of the Lemma.\nLet r = 1l where l = 1, 2, . . . . Consider the corresponding sets Ej ( 1l , m), l = 1, 2, . . . ;\nm = 1, 2, . . . , and j = 1, . . . , l(n, K). Then we obtain the sequence of numbers\n{N( 1l )} such that\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n1\n1\n1\nN\n<N\n< *** < N\n< ... .\n1\n2\nl\n1\nNow we assume that rm = 1l and Lm = 1l for all m from the interval (N( 1l ), N( l+1\n)).\n1\nFor m \u2264 N( 1 ), we assume rm = 1 and Lm = 1, i.e. the diameter of the sphere S n .\nChoosing the sequences {rm } and {Lm } according to described scheme, we obtain\nthat {xm } satisfies the definition of \u03bcp -sequences of points for K-quasimeromorphic\nmappings.\n\n2.8. LEMMA. Let p > 1. Then f is a p-Yosida K-quasimeromorphic mapping in Rn if and only if f does not possess a Mp -sequence.\nProof. Necessity. Let f be the p-Yosida mapping and {xm } be the Mp -sequence\nof points for f . Consider the sequence of mappings {f (xm + |xm |2\u2212p x)} in {|x| \u2264 r}.\nSince the sequence is normal in {|x| \u2264 r}, without loss of generality we suppose that\nit converges on {|x| \u2264 r}. There are two possible cases: either the limit mapping of\nthe sequence is a constant (including infinity) or a non-constant mapping.\nIn the first case, one can take r sufficiently small and N sufficiently big such\nthat the mappings f (xm + |xm |2\u2212p x) assume the values closed to the limit value in\n{|x| \u2264 r} for all m \u2265 N. In other words we can formulate this fact as following:\nf assumes the values closed to the limit value in each ball Bp (xm , r)), m \u2265 N,\nand therefore, the images f (Bp (xm , r)) do not cover S n . Hence, {xm } cannot be a\nMp -sequence for f .\nNow we suppose that g is a non-constant K-quasimeromorphic limit mapping of\nthe sequence {f (xm +|xm |2\u2212p x)} in {|x| \u2264 r}. We choose r such that q(g(x), g(0)) \u2264\n1/4 in {|x| \u2264 r}. According to the Hurwitz theorem for quasimeromorphic mappings\n[6, Lemma 2], [9], there is a number N such that q(f (xm + |xm |2\u2212p x), g(x)) \u2264 1/2\nin {|x| \u2264 r} for m \u2265 N. The last implies that {xm } cannot be a Mp -sequence for f .\nSufficiency. If f does not possess Mp -sequences of points for f then for every\nsequence {xk } with lim |xk | = \u221e, and every \u03b4 > 0 we always can find a subsequence\nk\u2192\u221e\n\u221e\nS\nn\n{xm } such that f assumes in\nBp (xm , \u03b4) all values from R except possibly at\nm=1\n\nleast l(n, K) + 1 values. In other words, the family {f (xm + |xm |2\u2212p x)} assumes in\nn\n{|x| \u2264 \u03b4} all values from R except possibly at least l(n, K) + 1 values. According\nto [6, Theorem 5], the family {f (xk + |xk |2\u2212p x)} is normal in {|x| \u2264 \u03b4}. Since {xk }\nis an arbitrary sequence, f is a p-Yosida quasimeromorphic mapping.\nNext lemma shows equivalence of the notions of \u03bcp -sequences and Mp -sequences\nfor spatial K-quasimeromorphic mappings.\n2.9. LEMMA. Let p > 1. A sequence {xm } in Rn , lim |xm | = \u221e, is a\nm\u2192\u221e\n\u03bcp -sequences of points for a K-quasimeromorphic mapping f in Rn if and only if\n{xm } is a Mp -sequence for f .\n6\n\n\fProof. It follows from definitions 2.1 and 2.5 that each \u03bcp -sequences of points\nfor a K-quasimeromorphic mapping f is a Mp -sequence for f .\nTo prove the converse statement we suppose that {xm } is a Mp -sequence for f\nand it is not a \u03bcp -sequence. Then there is a positive \u03b50 for which Lemma 2.7 is not\nsatisfied, i.e. there is a subsequence {xk } in Rn such that for each k the set of values\nn\nin R not assumed by f in the ball Bp (xk , \u03b50 ) cannot be contained in l sets whose\nspherical diameters do not exceed r0 . It implies that f omits l + 1 distinct values\nn\nc1,k , c2,k , . . . , cl+1,k from R in each ball Bp (xk , \u03b50 ) and\nq(cj,k , ci,k ) \u2265\n\nr0\n2\n\n,\n\ni 6= j\n\n(2.10)\n\nConsider the family of mappings {f (xk + |xk |2\u2212p x)} in the ball B0 = {|x| \u2264 \u03b50 }.\nSince every mapping fk (x) = f (xk + |xk |2\u2212p x) does not take l + 1 values satisfying\n(2.10) in the ball B0 , then by Theorem 5 [6], the family {fk (x)} is normal in B0 .\nBut according to our assumption, {xm } is a Mp -sequence for f and, consequently by\nLemma 2.8, the family of mappings cannot be normal at the origin. That contradicts\nour assumption.\nNow we consider the main result of the paper: mutual arrangement of a-points\nfor p-Yosida K-quasimeromorphic mappings in Rn .\n2.11. THEOREM. Let f be a K-quasimeromorphic mapping f in Rn . Let\nn\nA1 , . . . , Al+2 , where l = l(n, K), be distinct points in R and f \u22121 (Aj ) = {ajk | k \u2208 N},\nj = 1, 2, . . . , l + 2. Then f is a p-Yosida K-quasimeromorphic mapping in Rn , p > 1\nif and only if\n\u001a\n\u001b\n|ajk \u2212 aim |\ninf\n: ajk 6= 0 > 0 .\n(2.12)\ni6=j,k,m\n|ajk |2\u2212p\nProof. Necessity. Suppose that the limit value of (2.12) for sequences {a1k }\nand {a2m } is equal to 0. Then by Theorem 2.3, both sequences are Mp -sequences\nfor f and, consequently, f is not a p-Yosida mapping.\nSufficiency. Suppose that f is not a p-Yosida K-quasimeromorphic mapping\nin Rn . Then there is a \u03bcp -sequence of points {xm } for the mapping f . By the\ndefinition, there exists a number N such that from N onward every ball Bp (xm , \u03b5m ),\nlim \u03b5m = 0, contains the roots of at least two equations f (x) = A1 and f (x) = A2 ,\n\nm\u2192\u221e\n\nn\n\nwhere A1 , A2 \u2208 R . We choose accordingly those A1 -points and A2 -points, that\nbelong to Bp (xm , \u03b5m ) and denote them as {a1m } and {a2m }, resp. Then these points\nsatisfy the conditions\n|a1m \u2212 xm | < \u03b5m |xm |2\u2212p ,\n|a2m \u2212 xm | < \u03b5m |xm |2\u2212p ,\nand hence\n\n|a1m \u2212 a2m |\n= 0.\nm\u2192\u221e |a1m |2\u2212p\nlim\n\nThe last contradicts the conditions of the theorem.\nThe result similar to Theorem 2.11 for p = 1; that is, Julia exceptional functions,\nwas obtained by P.J\u00e4rvi [4, Theorem 6].\n7\n\n\f3\n\nYosida quasimeromorphic mappings of the first\norder\n\nSimilar to K.Yosida [12], we define Yosida K-quasimeromorphic mappings of the\nfirst order.\n3.1. Definition.\nA Yosida K-quasimeromorphic mapping f in Rn is called\nYosida K-quasimeromorphic mapping of the first order if for every sequence of points\n{xn } in Rn with lim |xn | = \u221e, limit mappings of converging subsequences of {f (x+\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nxn )} on compact subsets of Rn are not constants.\nn\n\nFor every set E \u2282 R , we denote by q(E) the spherical diameter of E.\n3.2. THEOREM. Let f be a Yosida K-quasimeromorphic mapping.\n(a) For every 0 < d < 1 there exists r > 0 such that\nsup q(f (B(x, r))) \u2264 d .\nx\u2208Rn\n\n(b) If for every r > 0 there exists \u03b4 > 0, such that\ninf q(f (B(x, r))) \u2265 \u03b4\n\n(3.3)\n\nsup nf (x, r, a) \u2264 C ,\n\n(3.4)\n\nx\u2208Rn\n\nthen\na\u2208R\n\nn\n\nwhere C depends of r and f .\nProof. Condition (a) follows from the definition of Yosida K-quasimeromorphic\nmappings and Theorem 1.7.\nTo prove condition (b) we assume that there exist sequences of points {xk }\nn\nin Rn with lim |xk | = \u221e, and {ak } in R , lim |ak | = a, satisfying the condition\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nlim nf (xk , r, ak ) = \u221e. Consider a family {fk (x)}, fk (x) = f (x+xk ), which is normal\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nin Rn . Without loss of generality, we assume that {fk (x)} is a converging sequence\non compact subsets of Rn , and by (3.3), the limit mapping F is non-constant. Since\nF is a discrete mapping we may choose R such that a \u2208\n/ F (\u2202B(0, R)). The sequence\n{fk } converges uniformly to F in B(0, R) and therefore\nfk (\u2202B(0, R)) \u2229 {a, ak } = \u2205 .\nHence, by a property of the topological index [9, p.86]\nnf (xk , r, ak ) \u2264 nfk (0, R, ak ) = nfk (0, R, a) = nF (0, R, a) < \u221e\nfor large k. This contradicts our assumption.\n3.5. COROLLARY. If f is a Yosida K-quasimeromorphic mapping and\nfor every r > 0 there exists \u03b4 > 0 such that\ninf q(f (B(x, r))) \u2265 \u03b4\n\nx\u2208Rn\n\n8\n\n\fthen f is a Yosida K-quasimeromorphic mapping of the first kind.\n3.6. Example. n-periodic quasimeromorphic mappings are Yosida quasimeromorphic mappings of the first kind. Such mappings were studied by O. Martio and\nU. Srebro in [5].\nRecall that for a quasimeromorphic mapping f in B(0, R) and r < R \u2264 \u221e the\naverage counting function Af (r) is defined as\nZ\nn(0, r, y)\n1\ndm(y) ,\nAf (r) =\n\u03bbn\n(1 + |y|2)n\nR\n\nwhere\n\u03bbn =\n\nZ\n\nR\n\nn\n\n1\ndm(y)\n(1 + |y|2)n\n\nn\n\nn\n\nand m(y) is a Lebesgue measure in R .\n3.7.\nThen\n\nTHEOREM. Let f be a Yosida K-quasimeromorphic mapping in Rn .\nAf (r) = O(r n ) as r \u2192 \u221e .\n\nFurthermore, if f is a Yosida K-quasimeromorphic mapping of the first order then\nAf (r)\n< \u221e.\nr\u2192\u221e r n\n\n0 < lim\nLet\n\n1\nAf (x, r) =\n\u03bbn\n\nZ\nR\n\nn\n\n(3.8)\n\nn(x, r, y)\ndm(y) .\n(1 + |y|2)n\n\n3.9. LEMMA. If f is a Yosida K-quasimeromorphic mapping of the first\norder then for every fixed r > 0\nlim inf Af (x, r) > 0 .\n|x|\u2192\u221e\n\nProof.\n\nAssume that lim inf Af (x, r) = 0. Then there exists a sequence {xk } in\n|x|\u2192\u221e\n\nn\n\nn\n\nR on which n(xk , r, y) \u2192 0 as k \u2192 \u221e for almost all y \u2208 R . Therefore Af (xk , r) =\nAfk (r) \u2192 AF (r) > 0 as k \u2192 \u221e since F 6= const. This is a contradiction.\nProof of Theorem 3.7. If f is a Yosida K-quasimeromorphic mapping, then\nby Theorem 3.2 (a), for every 0 < d < 1 there exists \u03c1 > 0 such that q(f (B(x, \u03c1))) \u2264\nd for every x \u2208 Rn and therefore Af (x, \u03c1) \u2264 C < \u221e.\nLet us consider the ball B(0, r) where r is sufficiently large, and Whitney decomposition W of B(0, r). That is, W is a union of dyadic essentially disjoint closed\ncubes Qk of the diameter \u03c1 and centered\nS at ak . Each cube Qk can be inscribed into\nthe ball B(ak , \u03c1/2). Then B(0, r) \u2282 B(ak , \u03c1/2) and therefore\nk\n\nAf (r) =\n\nR\n\nR\n\n\u2264\n\nn(0,r,y)\n(1+|y|2 )n\n\nn\n\nP\n\nk\n\nR\n\ndm(y) =\n\nB(ak ,\u03c1/2)\n\nR\n\nB(0,r)\nJ(x,f )\n(1+|f (x)|2 )n\n\n9\n\nJ(x,f )\n(1+|f (x)|2 )n\n\ndm(x)\n\ndm(x) \u2264 CN(r) ,\n\n\fwhere N(r) is the number of cubes Qk\u0012in\u0013the Whitney decomposition W. One can\nn\n2\nVolume B(0, r)\n=\nr n . Hence, Af (r) = O(r n) as r \u2192 \u221e.\nsee that N(r) \u2248\nVolume B(x, \u03c1/2)\n\u03c1\nTo prove (3.8) we will use a similar method. We take the cubes Qk in the Whitney\ndecomposition W such that each ball B(x, \u03c1) is inscribed into Qk . By Lemma 3.9,\nAf (x, r) \u2265 \u03b4 > 0 for every x \u2208 Rn . Then\nR n(0,r,y)\nR\nJ(x,f )\nAf (r) = (1+|y|\ndm(x)\n2 )n dm(y) =\n(1+|f (x)|2 )n\nn\nB(0,r)\nR\nP R\nJ(x,f )\n\u2265 k\ndm(x) \u2265 \u03b4N(r) .\n(1+|f (x)|2 )n\nB(ak ,\u03c1)\n\nThus,\n\nAf (r)\n> 0 and (3.8) is proved.\nrn\n\n4\n\nFurther remarks and questions\n\nIn this final part of the paper we make some remarks and pose some natural questions.\nn\nIn [5], O. Martio and U. Srebro (Theorem 7.4) proved that if f : Rn \u2192 R is an\nn-periodic K-quasimeromorphic mapping then\nX\ni(x, f ) < \u221e\n(4.1)\nN(f, y, F\u0303f ) =\nx\u2208f \u22121 (y)\u2229Ff\n\nn\n\nfor all y \u2208 R , where F\u0303f is a fundamental set for f .\nIt follows from Theorems 2.11 and 3.2 that mentioned result can be generalized\non Yosida K-quasimeromorphic mappings. In other words, we can say: if f is a\nYosida K-quasimeromorphic mapping then for every r > 0\nsup N(f, y, B(a, r)) < \u221e\na\u2208Rn\nn\n\nfor all y \u2208 R .\nIt will interesting to prove the following conjectures.\nn\n\n4.2 Problem. f : Rn \u2192 R is a Yosida K-quasimeromorphic mapping if and\nonly if there is r > 0 such that\nsup N(f, y, B(a, r)) < \u221e\na\u2208Rn\nn\n\nfor all y \u2208 R . Furthermore,\ninfn sup N(f, y, B(a, r)) > 0\n\ny\u2208R a\u2208Rn\n\nis the necessary and sufficient condition for f to be a Yosida K-quasimeromorphic\nmapping.\nIn Theorem 3.7, we gave the estimation of the growth of Af (r) for Yosida\nquasimeromorphic mappings and Yosida K-quasimeromorphic mappings of the first\n10\n\n\forder. Since Yosida mappings are characterized as mappings with uniform behavior\nin Rn , it is a natural question to describe Yosida K-quasimeromorphic mappings in\nterms of uniform growth of Af (r) in Rn .\nAcknowledgements.
