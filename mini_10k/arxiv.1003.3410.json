Its\none-loop gauge-coupling renormalization-group equations are shown to have identical\nsolutions to those of the minimal supersymmetric standard model. It also has a rich\ndark sector, with at least three stable particles.\n\n\fIntroduction : In the conventional left-right gauge extension of the Standard Model (SM)\nof particle interactions, the SU(2)R fermion doublet (\u03bd, e)R pairs up with the usual SU(2)L\nfermion doublet (\u03bd, e)L through a Higgs bidoublet, so that both the electron e and the\nneutrino \u03bd obtain Dirac masses. Remarkably, this situation is not compulsory. It is in fact\npossible to have a symmetry such that \u03bdR is not the Dirac mass partner of \u03bdL . It becomes\nanother particle entirely, call it nR , and the same symmetry makes it a dark-matter fermion\n(scotino). This intriguing scenario has been elaborated in some recent papers [1, 2, 3, 4].\nThe left-right structure itself was discussed already 23 years ago [5, 6] in the context of\nsuperstring-inspired E6 models. Called the Alternative Left-Right Model (ALRM), it has\nthe important property of no tree-level flavor-changing neutral currents. This makes it\npossible for the SU(2)R breaking scale to be as low as a TeV, allowing both its charged\nWR\u00b1 and Z \u2032 gauge bosons to be observable at the large hadron collider (LHC). However, its\nrelevance to dark matter was not considered until one year ago [1].\nIn this paper, the latest version [4] of the Dark Left-Right Model (DLRM) is shown\nto have a simple supersymmetric extension with gauge-coupling unification. The resulting\none-loop renormalization-group equations turn out to have solutions identical to those of the\nMinimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), as well as two previously proposed leftright extensions [7, 8]. It also has a rich dark sector, with at least three stable particles [9].\nModel : Consider the gauge group SU(3)C \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R \u00d7 U(1). Following Ref. [4], a\nnew global U(1) symmetry S is imposed so that the spontaneous breaking of SU(2)R \u00d7S will\nleave the combination L = S + T3R unbroken. Under SU(3)C \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R \u00d7 U(1) \u00d7 S,\nthe superfields transform as shown in Table 1. Because of supersymmetry, the Higgs sector\nis doubled, in analogy to the transition from the SM to MSSM. Another set of Higgs doublet\nsuperfields \u03b7 and a new set of charged Higgs singlet superfields \u03c7 are added to obtain gaugecoupling unification [7, 8].\n\n2\n\n\fTable 1: Particle content of proposed model.\nSuperfield\n\u03c8 = (\u03bd, e)\n\u03c8 c = (ec , nc )\n\u03bdc\nn\nQ = (u, d)\nQc = (hc , uc )\ndc\nh\n\u22061\n\u22062\n\u03a6L1\n\u03a6L2\n\u03a6R1\n\u03a6R2\n\u03b7L1\n\u03b7L2\n\u03b7R1\n\u03b7R2\n\u03c71\n\u03c72\n\nSU(3)C \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R \u00d7 U(1)\n(1, 2, 1, \u22121/2)\n(1, 1, 2, 1/2)\n(1, 1, 1, 0)\n(1, 1, 1, 0)\n(3, 2, 1, 1/6)\n(3\u2217 , 1, 2, \u22121/6)\n(3\u2217 , 1, 1, 1/3)\n(3, 1, 1, \u22121/3)\n(1, 2, 2, 0)\n(1, 2, 2, 0)\n(1, 2, 1, \u22121/2)\n(1, 2, 1, 1/2)\n(1, 1, 2, \u22121/2)\n(1, 1, 2, 1/2)\n(1, 2, 1, \u22121/2)\n(1, 2, 1, 1/2)\n(1, 1, 2, \u22121/2)\n(1, 1, 2, 1/2)\n(1, 1, 1, \u22121)\n(1, 1, 1, 1)\n\nS\n1\n\u22123/2\n\u22121\n2\n0\n1/2\n0\n\u22121\n1/2\n\u22121/2\n0\n0\n\u22121/2\n1/2\n\u22122\n2\n\u22123/2\n3/2\n\u22122\n2\n\nThe symmetry S is used here to distinguish \u03c8, \u03a6L1 , \u03b7L1 from one another, as well as \u03c8 c ,\n\u03a6R2 , \u03b7R2 .

This structure guarantees the\nabsence of tree-level flavor-changing neutral currents [10].\nDark matter : As it stands, both the neutrino \u03bd (L = 1) and the scotino n (L = 2) are Dirac\nfermions, and lepton number L is conserved. If we now introduce a mass term \u03bd c \u03bd c which\nbreaks L by two units, then \u03bd gets a small Majorana mass through the canonical seesaw\nmechanism, as is usually assumed. As for n, it remains a Dirac fermion, being still protected\nby a global U(1) symmetry. This can be understood by noting that with the addition of the\n\u03bd c \u03bd c term, the same allowed bilinear and trilinear terms in Eqs. (1) to (4) are obtained, if\nan odd matter parity M is assumed for \u03c8, \u03c8 c , \u03bd c , n, Q, Qc , dc , h and the S assignments of \u03c8,\n\u03c8 c , \u03bd c and n are changed to 0, \u22121/2, 0, and 1 respectively. There are thus two conserved\nquantities: the usual M (or its resulting R) parity and a global U(1) number L\u2032 = S + T3R ,\nwith L\u2032 = 0 for the usual quarks and leptons and L\u2032 = 1 for the scotino n. Because of their\nS assignments, the \u03b7 and \u03c7 superfields appear always in pairs, so there is another parity\nH which is conserved. Hence there are at least three stable particles. Note that \u03b7 and \u03c7\ncommunicate with the quarks and leptons only through \u2206 and \u03a6, i.e. the so-called Higgs\n\"portals\".\nThe various superfields of this model under L\u2032 , M, and H are listed in Table 2. The\nusual R parity is then defined as R \u2261 MH(\u22121)2j . A possible scenario for dark matter is to\nhave the following three coexisting stable particles: the lightest neutralino (L\u2032 = 0, H = +,\n0\nR = \u2212), the scotino n (L\u2032 = 1, H = +, R = +), and the exotic \u03b7R2\nfermion (L\u2032 = 1, H = \u2212,\n\nR = +). However, there may be additional stable particles due to kinematics. For example,\nif the scalar counterpart of n cannot decay into n plus the lightest neutralino, then it will\nalso be stable. There may even be several exotic stable \u03b7 and \u03c7 particles. The dark sector\n\n4\n\n\fmay be far from just the one particle that is usually assumed, as in the MSSM.\nTable 2: Superfields under L\u2032 = S + T3R , M, and H.\nL\u2032\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n\u22121\n1\n\u22121\n1\n\u22121\n2\n\u22122\n\nM\n\u2212\n+\n+\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n\nH\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\nSuperfields\nu, d, \u03bd, e\ng, \u03b3, WL\u00b1 , Z, Z \u2032\n+\n0\n0\n0\n\u03c60L1 , \u03c6\u2212\nL1 , \u03c6L2 , \u03c6L2 , \u03c6R1 , \u03c6R2\n\u2212\n+\n0\n0\n\u03b411\n, \u03b411\n, \u03b422\n, \u03b422\nn, hc\nnc , h\n+\n0\nWR+ , \u03c6+\nR2 , \u03b412 , \u03b412\n\u2212\n0\nWR\u2212 , \u03c6\u2212\nR1 , \u03b421 , \u03b421\n0\n\u03b7R2\n0\n\u03b7R1\n+\n+\n0\n\u03b7L2\n, \u03b7L2\n, \u03b7R2\n, \u03c7+\n2\n\u2212\n\u2212\n0\n\u03b7L1\n, \u03b7L1\n, \u03b7R1\n, \u03c7\u2212\n1\n\nGauge-coupling unification : The one-loop renormalization-group equations for the gauge\ncouplings of SU(3)C \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R \u00d7 U(1)X are given by\n1\n1\nbi\nM2\n,\n\u2212\n=\nln\n\u03b1i (M1 ) \u03b1i (M2 )\n2\u03c0 M1\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03b1i = gi2 /4\u03c0 and the numbers bi are determined by the particle content of the model\nbetween M1 and M2 .

(30) and (31) are identical to Eqs. (13) and (14) of the MSSM respectively\nif we set MX = MR = MS . Thus this model is no worse than the MSSM for gaugecoupling unification, and two-loop equations and particle thresholds may be invoked to fix it.\n7\n\n\fThe same one-loop solutions are obtained in two other previously proposed supersymmetric\nleft-right models [7, 8]. If the one-loop equations (30) and (31) are taken at face value,\n7/4\n\n\u22123/4\n\nMU = 3.33 \u00d7 1016 GeV and MR MX\n\n= 14.7 GeV. Take for example MR = 500 GeV, then\n\nMX = 55.2 TeV. The additional singlets are thus much heavier, but since they do not affect\neither SU(2)R \u00d7 U(1)X breaking or supersymmetry breaking, this is an acceptable scenario.\nIn terms of SO(10) multiplets, Q, Qc , \u03c8, \u03c8 c belong to 16; h, dc and \u2206 to 10; \u03a6 and \u03b7 to 16 +\n16\u2217 ; and \u03c7 to 120 + 120\u2217 . The chosen set of superfields is free of anomalies.\nConclusion : The dark left-right model, where the SU(2)R fermion doublet (n, e)R contains\nthe dark-matter fermion (scotino) n which is distinguished from the usual lepton e by an\nU(1) global symmetry, is extended to include supersymmetry. New superfields are added,\nresulting in one-loop renormalization-group equations for the gauge couplings with solutions\nidentical to those of the MSSM. The dark sector is automatically extended to include at\nleast three stable particles.\nAcknowledgement : This work was supported in part by the U. S.
