last\ncentury, and has been intensively studied for a wide range of hydrodynamical problems. Many\ncurrent efficient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software packages offer great flexibility\nin geometry and material properties. However, two-phase flow problems with moving boundaries still present a major challenge to the current state of computational fluid dynamics.\nAlthough an interface is a three-dimensional region with a thickness of the order of molecular\ndiameters it is conveniently modeled as a two dimensional surface (Cosserat surface). Surface\ntension, being a geometrical property of a two dimensional surface, is proportional to the\ncurvature of the interface. It is also a material property of the two adjoined materials, thus\nit is an intrinsic property of the surface. In order to include surface tension properly into the\nmodeling we need to formulate an additional balance equation for the surface and add it to\nthe volume balance equation.\nInterfacial dynamics for Newtonian surface fluids was first described by Scriven in [Sc] using\ntensor notation. However, tensor notation is not part of a typical engineering education. Also,\nthere is scarce literature on interface balance equations covering surface tension, most use a\nsource term instead.\nThe main goal of these notes is to give a review of the equations for two phase flow problems with an interface between the two phases in a self-contained way, and, in particular, to\nproperly include surface tension into the interface balance equations.\nBalance equations at an interface involve geometrical quantities, such as normal and tangential vectors on the interface and mean curvature of the interface. We recall them in section 2.\nFor the balance equations and the jump conditions we need Reynolds' transport theorems\nfor a material body and for a material body with an internal interface. We review them in\nsection 3.1 and 3.2. The kinematics of a moving surface are described in section 3.3.\nIn section 4.1 and 4.2 we recall balance equations for single phase problems and ordinary\njump conditions for an interface, where the adjacent phases are incompressible Newtonian fluids. Taking surface tension into account increases the complexity. The normal and tangential\nvectors on the interface can be derived by a simple geometric demonstration. However, to describe mean curvature (in a physical, intuitive way) use of tensor notation becomes inevitable.\nThe jump condition from section 4.2 does not cover surface tension.\nSurface tension is proportional to the curvature of the interface, being a geometrical property of a surface. It is also a material property of the two related materials, thus it is an\n\n2\n\n\fintrinsic property of the surface. In order to include surface tension properly into a jump\ncondition we need to formulate an additional balance equation for the surface and add it to\nthe volume balance equation. This is done in section 4.3. In return it involves kinematic\nrelations of the interface and the Reynolds transport theorem for surfaces. They are given in\nsection 3.3 and 3.4.\nFinally, in section 5, the generic balance equations are applied to mass momentum and\nenergy and common simplifications and boundary conditions are discussed.\nPreliminaries In this text we use Einstein summation convention, which states a repeated\nindex implies a sum over all possible values for that index. When the index takes only the\nvalues 1, 2, Greek letters are used and when the index takes the values 1, 2, 3, Latin letters\nare used. A vector in a general curvilinear coordinate system can be referred to the standard\n\b\nbasis {ei } or to the dual basis ei and we can write v = v i ei or v = vi ei . The v i are called\ncontravariant components and the vi are called covariant components of the vector v. The\ndual basis is defined by ei * ej = \u03b4i j . In a Cartesian coordinate system there is no difference\nbetween standard and dual basis and the contravariant and covariant coordinates of a vector\nare the same. In a curvilinear coordinate system the basis vectors carry a part of the length\ninformation of a vector.\nThe tensor (outer) product is defined by its action\n(u \u2297 v) w = u (v * w)\n\nor\n\nu (v \u2297 w) = (u * v) w .\n\nComputing the outer products of the base vectors a second order tensor can be represented\nas T = T ij ei \u2297 ej = T ij ei \u2297 ej = Ti j ei \u2297 ej = Tij ei \u2297 ej . The scalar (dot) product between\ntwo tensors is defined as\n(v 1 \u2297 v 2 ) \u2022 (w1 \u2297 w2 ) = (v 1 * w1 ) (v2 * w2 ) .\nThe gradient of a vector is defined as\n\u2202\n\u2207v = ei i \u2297 v ,\n\u2202x\nand the divergence of a second order tensor is defined as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0001\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202S ij\nij\nij\n\u2207 * S = ek k S ei \u2297 ej = ek k * S ei ej =\nej .\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\u2202xi\nAlternatively one could first take the derivative and then compute the dot or tensor product,\n\u2202v\n\u2202S\ni.e. \u2207v = \u2202x\nk \u2297 ek or \u2207 * S = \u2202xk * ek . Note that both definitions are possible and are used in\nthe literature. Our definition is more common in fluid dynamics, the later definition is more\ncommon in elasticity.\n\n3\n\n\f2 Geometry of a moving interface\nIn this section we summarize the geometrical properties of the moving interface between two\nphases. First, the formulas for normal and tangential vectors, mean curvature and interface\nvelocity are given. Then, using an implicit representation of the surface, the geometrical\nproperties of two phases at the interface are computed. Two formulas to compute the normal\nvector and two formulas to compute the mean curvature are given.\nThe material in this section is mainly based on [Ed], [Ar], [TrTo] and [Er]. They present a\nformulation of classical continuum physics using tensor calculus. For an introduction in tensor\ncalculus we refer to [Scha]. [Sl07], [Sl99] and [De] present transport phenomena (including\ninterphase transport phenomena) using moderate tensor notation. [K\u00fc] is a differential geometry book written more for mathematicians, [Op] has an easier notation but lack some\nderivations. For advanced calculus we refer to [Ap] and [Ka].\n\n2.1 Curvilinear coordinate systems\nA two-dimensional surface can best be anz\nalyzed by covering the surface with a grid,\nsee figure 1. The grid is obtained by the\ncurves where u1 and u2 are constant. The\nposition of a point on the surface can be\nreplacements\ngiven intrinsically in terms of the twoPSfrag\ncurvilinear surface coordinates (or parameters) u1\nx\nand u2 , or extrinsically by a position vector\nto the point. This defines a curvilinear coordinate system which is not orthogonal in\ngeneral.\n\nn\n\na2\n\nu2 =const.\n\na1\nu1 =const. y\n\nx\n\nFigure 1: Tangent space on a surface\nTangential and normal vectors If the interface between the two phases is not stationary the\nposition vector to a point on the interface is given in cartesian coordinates as\nx(u1 , u2 , t) = x1 (u1 , u2 , t) e1 + x2 (u1 , u2 , t) e2 + x3 (u1 , u2 , t) e3 ,\n\n(1)\n\nor in index notation as\nx(u\u03b1 , t) = xi (u\u03b1 , t) ei ,\n\n(2)\n\n4\n\n\fwhere u\u03b1 = u1 , u2 .\nA Taylor series expansion of x in the surface variables u\u03b1 up to the linear term yields the\ntotal derivative\nx(u\u03b1 + du\u03b1 ) \u2212 x(u\u03b1 ) = dx =\n\n\u2202x\ndu\u03b1 .\n\u2202u\u03b1\n\n\u2202x\nAlong u1 -curves, u2 = constant (du2 = 0), \u2202u\n1 defines the tangent vector along this curves;\n\u2202x\nsimilarly \u2202u2 defines the tangent vector along the u2 curve. The derivatives with respect to\nthe curvilinear coordinates u\u03b1 are called covariant derivatives. The covariant derivatives of a\nposition vector\n\na\u03b1 =\n\n\u2202x\n\u2202xi\n=\ne\ni\n\u2202u\u03b1\n\u2202u\u03b1\n\n(3)\n\nform the base vectors of a local surface coordinate system. In terms of the covariant base\nvectors the surface metric tensor is defined as\na\u03b1\u03b2 = a\u03b1 * a\u03b2 .\n\n(4)\n\nThe metric tensor is also called the first fundamental form. The local unit normal vector at\na point (u1 , u2 ) normal to the surface is defined by\nn=\n\na1 \u00d7 a2\n.\n|a1 \u00d7 a2 |\n\nDual basis\n\n(5)\n\n\b\nAnother set of base vectors a\u03b2 , is defined by the surface Kronecker delta,\n\na\u03b1 * a\u03b2 = \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 ,\n\nthey are called dual base vectors or reciprocal or contravariant base vectors respectively. This\ncondition orthogonality relation defines a vector a1 that lies in the plane formed by the vectors\na1 , a2 , is perpendicular to a2 , forms an acute angle with a1 . This is also the definition of the\ngradient \u2207u1 of the surface coordinate, which is perpendicular to the level surface defined by\nu1 (x1 , x2 , x3 , t) = constant. Similarly the orthogonality relation defines the vector a2 . Then\nthe dual or contravariant base vectors are given by\na\u03b1 = \u2207u\u03b1 = ei\n\n\u2202u\u03b1\n.\n\u2202xi\n\n(6)\n\nWith the contravariant base vectors the covariant surface metric tensor is\na\u03b1\u03b2 = a\u03b1 * a\u03b2 .\n\n(7)\n\n5\n\n\fHowever, often the dual basis is more conveniently calculated by means of the local unit\nnormal vector\na1 =\n\na2 \u00d7 n\n,\n[a1 , a2 , n]\n\na2 =\n\nn \u00d7 a1\n.\n[a1 , a2 , n]\n\n(8)\n\n[a1 , a2 , n] = [a1 \u00d7 a2 ] * n is the scalar triple product.\nOrthogonal curvilinear coordinate systems If the base vectors of a curvilinear coordinate\nsystem are mutually orthogonal (a1 * a2 = 0), then the covariant and contravariant metric\ntensor reduce simply to\n#\n\"\n\"\n#\n11\na\n0\na11 0\n,\na\u03b1\u03b2 =\na\u03b1\u03b2 =\n.\n0 a22\n0 a22\nFor such orthogonal systems the normalized surface vectors are called self reciprocal, in the\n1\n2\nsense that \u221aaa111 = \u221aa 11 and \u221aaa222 = \u221aa 22 . It is convenient to introduce unit vectors\na\n\na1\n,\ne1 = \u221a\na11\nSurface gradient\n\na\n\na2\ne2 = \u221a\n.\na22\nThe identity tensor is defined by\n\nI = a1 \u2297 a1 + a2 \u2297 a2 + n \u2297 n .\nIt possesses the property Ix = x for any x. This relation is also called orthogonality relation.\nBy subtracting the part related to the normal vector from I the surface identity tensor is\ndefined as\nI S = I \u2212 n \u2297 n = a\u03b1 \u2297 a\u03b1 .\n\n(9)\n\nSimilarly the surface gradient is defined by the projection in normal direction subtracted from\nthe gradient\n\u2207S = I S \u2207 = (I \u2212 n \u2297 n) \u2207 = \u2207 \u2212 (n \u2297 n) \u2207 .\n\n(10)\n\nBy this we get\n\u2207S\n\n\u03b1\n\n= a \u2297 a\u03b1\n= a\u03b1\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202\n.\n\u2202u\u03b1\n\n\u2202\nej\n\u2202xj\n\n\u0013\n\n=a\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202xj\na\u03b1 * ej\n\u2202u\u03b1\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\n\u2202xi\n= a ei \u03b1 * ej\n\u2202u\n\u2202xj\n\u03b1\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\n6\n\n\f2.2 Mean curvature\nThe mean curvature is proportional to the rate of change of the local normal vector with\nrespect to the surface coordinates.\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\n\u03b1 \u2202\n*n.\n(13)\na\nH = \u2212 \u2207S * n = \u2212\n2\n2\n\u2202u\u03b1\n\n2.3 Implicit parameterized surface\nTo compute the normal and tangential vectors and the mean curvature of the moving interface\nit is necessary to choose a parametrization of the interface. For example, if a vertical tube\nis assumed where a thin film is flowing down along the inner walls (without waves), then\nthe problem has rotational symmetry and the interface between the liquid and the gas can\nbe parameterized with the surface coordinates u1 = z and u2 = \u03b8. To assume an implicit\nparameterized surface is more general.\nNormal and tangential vectors of an implicit parametrized surface Every moving surface\ncan be locally described by a real-valued function of two variables and time\nz = h(u, v, t)\n\nor implicitly\n\nF (u, v, z, t) = z \u2212 h(u, v, t) = 0 .\n\nFor convenience we write u1 = u, u2 = v. By this parametrization the position vector to any\npoint on the surface becomes\nx(u, v, t) = u e1 + v e2 + h(u, v, t) e 3 .\nThe tangential vectors are given by the covariant base vectors (3) as\n\uf8ee \uf8f9\n\uf8ee \uf8f9\n1\n0\n\u2202x \uf8ef \uf8fa\n\u2202x \uf8ef \uf8fa\na2 =\na1 =\n=\uf8f00\uf8fb ,\n=\uf8f01\uf8fb .\n\u2202u\n\u2202v\n\u2202h\n\u2202h\n\u2202u\n\n(14)\n\n\u2202v\n\nThe local unit normal vector is the cross product of the tangent vectors, scaled by its length.\nAlternatively, if the surface is given by z = h(u, v, t), the unit normal vector can be obtained\nfrom the gradient of the implicit function F (u, v, z, t) = 0. Expanding F (u, v, z, t) in a Taylor\nseries up to the linear term for the variables u, v, z leads to the total derivative\ndF =\n\n\u2202F\n\u2202F\n\u2202F\ndu +\ndv +\ndz ,\n\u2202u\n\u2202v\n\u2202z\n\n7\n\n\fwhich is zero because F = 0. Writing the total derivative as \u2207F * du = 0 where du =\n[du, dv, dz] shows that the gradient \u2207F is perpendicular to the level surface defined by\nF (u, v, z, t) = 0.

However, the definition of\nthe mean curvature with (13) is more physically intuitive.\nFor the computation of the mean curvature with (18) only the covariant base vectors and\nthe derivatives of the covariant base vectors need to be computed. If (13) is used to compute\nthe mean curvature, the contravariant base vectors and their derivatives will also need to\nbe computed. Using the shape operator to compute the mean curvature often simplifies the\ncomputations, especially in the case of orthogonal coordinate systems.\n\n9\n\n\f3 Kinematics of bulk fluids and of the moving interface\nIn this section we present kinematical relations that are necessary to formulate the balance\nequations at an interface between two phases. Experiments show that a fluid interface is in\nfact a three-dimensional region with a thickness on the micro-scale level. Following [Gi], such\nan interface can be regarded as a two-dimensional dividing surface where the effects of the\ninterface on the adjoining bulk phases are represented by surface excess mass, momentum and\nenergy.\nFirst we give kinematical relations for the bulk fluids, then we consider a material volume\nwith an internal interface. Next we discuss the kinematical relations of the two-dimensional\nmoving interface and in the last section we deal with kinematical relations related to the\ncurvature of the interface.\nThe first part of this section is mainly based on [Ar], [Scha] and [TrTo]. For the interface\nrelated sections see also [Sl07], [Sl99] and [Ed].\n\n3.1 Kinematics of a material volume\nTo clarify terminology we first recall some kinematics of bulk fluids and give the Reynolds\ntransport theorem for a material volume.\nFrom the basic assumption of continuum theory, a body consists of infinitely many particles\nwithout dimension and no space between them and every particle corresponds to a position\nin space. A particle is represented at a given initial time, by a position vector \u03be, as shown\nin figure 2. The coordinates of \u03be are called material coordinates. At another time the same\nparticle is represented by another position vector as a function of the initial position of the\nparticle and time\nx = x(\u03be, t)\n\n(21)\n\nThe coordinates of x are called spatial coordinates.\nThe initial position of the particle is taken as a reference configuration. Equation (21)\ndefines the motion of a particle. Assuming continuous motion and that a particle can not\noccupy two places at the same time the relation is a one-to-one mapping and we can also\nwrite conversely\n\u03be = \u03be(x, t) .\n\n10\n\n\fPhysical quantities like density, velocity and temperature, which are functions of space and\ntime, are called field variables and they are here denoted by \u03c6. A field variable can also be\ngiven as a function of particle and time. The representation of a field variable as a function\nof space and time is called spatial (or Euler) representation, that is\n\u03c6 = \u03c6(x, t)\n\nor\n\n\u03c6 = \u03c6(\u03be(x, t), t) .\n\nThe representation of a field variable as a function of particle and time is called material (or\nLagrange) representation, that is\n\u03c6 = \u03c6(\u03be, t)\n\nor\n\n\u03c6 = \u03c6(x(\u03be, t), t) .\n\nBalance equations of mass, momentum and energy are appropriately described in an Eulerian\nframework.\n\nz\nMaterial derivative and velocity Field variables are functions of several variables, so their\nderivatives are partial derivatives. Partial derivatives where spatial coordinates are held constant are denoted by \u2202.

A mass conserving\nvolume is called material volume (or material body) and here denoted by V0 . It is moving\nwith time and deforming in general. A quantity B0 continuously defined over a material volR\nume V0 is given by B0 = V0 \u03c6 dV . The rate of change of B0 with respect to time is given\nby\nZ\ndB0 (t)\nd\n\u03c6(x, t) dV .\n=\ndt\ndt\nV0 (x,t)\n\nIn an Eulerian representation V0 (x, t) depends on time, so \u0010that\u0011integration and differentiation\ni\nthe volume element can be\ncan not be interchanged.

By using Gauss theorem3 , the divergence term in the volume integral can be\nchanged into an area integral\nI\nZ\nZ\nd\n\u2202\u03c6\ndV + \u03c6 v * n dA ,\n(25)\n\u03c6 dV =\ndt\n\u2202t\nV0\n\n3\n\nThe Gauss theorem or divergence theorem for a vector f is given as:\n\n12\n\nR\n\n\u2207*f dV =\n\nH\n\nf *n dA.\n\n\fwhere the normal vector is directed outwards on the surface. The velocity v is the velocity\nof mass while moving across the surface. Equations (24) \u2013 (25) are called Reynolds transport\ntheorem. In the form of (25) the Reynolds transport theorem has a physical meaning: The\nrate of accumulation of a quantity in a material volume can be interpreted as the rate of\naccumulation of the quantity in a volume that equals the material volume at a given time\nplus convective flux (connected to mass) leaving the volume through the surface at that time.\n\n3.2 Reynolds transport theorem for a material volume with an interface\nreplacements\nWe consider a material volume VPSfrag\n0 = Vl +\nVg , where the field variable has the value \u03c6l\nng\nn\n(l for liquid phase) in the volume Vl and the\n\u00c3\nvalue \u03c6g (g for gas phase) in the volume Vg ,\nVg\nAl\nas shown in figure 3. An interface between\ntwo immiscible fluids is called a material inVl\nAg\nterface, it is formed by the same material\nelements or particles at all times. If phase\nnl\nchange occurs at an interface between two\naggregate states of a fluid, as is the case of\ncondensation or evaporation, the surface veFigure 3: Material volume with interface\nlocity u of the interface differs from the velocity v of the mass, and the interface is called a singular interface.\nThe difference between the two values at the surface is denoted by\nhh i\n\u03c6 := \u03c6g \u2212 \u03c6l\n\nand called the jump of \u03c6 across the interface.\nThe rate of change of B0 with respect to time is the sum of the rate of change of Bl and Bg\nwith respect to time\ndBl (t) dBg (t)\ndB0 (t)\n=\n+\n,\ndt\ndt\ndt\nthat is\nZ\nZ\nZ\nd\nd\nd\n\u03c6 dV =\n\u03c6l dV +\n\u03c6g dV .\ndt\ndt\ndt\nV0\n\nVl\n\nVg\n\nThe volumes Vl and Vg are not material, so that we need the Reynolds transport theorem in\na modified version for an arbitrary volume.\n\n13\n\n\fReynolds transport theorem for two arbitrary volumes A quantity Bu which is continuously\nR\ndefined over an arbitrary volume Vu is given by Bu = Vu \u03c6 dV . The volume Vu is assumed to\nconsist of fictive mass and shall be material (conserving the fictive mass).

It states that the rate of accumulation of a quantity in a material volume, where \u03c6\nundergoes a jump on an interface can be interpreted as the rate of accumulation of the quantity in a volume that equals the material volume at a given time plus convective flow of the\nquantities \u03c6l and \u03c6g leaving the volume through the outer surface and the interface at that\ntime.

According to the basic assumption of continuum theory a surface consists\nat every moment of infinitely many particles. In particular, a particle joining the interface\ncoincides with the particle that was at that position before. For a particle which is leaving the\ninterface instantaneously another particle emerges. So although there is a many-to-one mapping between particles and the region in the surface that is occupied by them, we can assign\none representing particle for all possible particles at one point. We will call the representing\nparticle simply particle (see [TrTo]).\nThe position vector to a point on the surface was given in section 2 as a function of surface\ncoordinates and time (1) and is here denoted by a lower index S\nxS = xS (u\u03b1 , t)\n\nwith \u03b1 = 1, 2 .\n\n(31)\n\nAt a given time a particle on the surface is represented by a position vector, which is here\nalso denoted by a lower index S\n\u03be S = \u03be S (u\u03b10 ) .\n\n(32)\n\nWe take this position as the initial position and call it intrinsic surface reference configuration.\nConversely at a given time every position in the surface corresponds to a particle\nu\u03b10 = u\u03b10 (\u03be S ) .\n\n4\n\n(33)\n\nFor a material volume with an internal interface Gauss theorem becomes (compare footnote 3)\nR\nH\nR\n\u2207*[\u03c6 v] dV = \u03c6 v*dA \u2212 \u00c3[[ \u03c6 ]] v*n d\u00c3.\n\n15\n\n\fObviously the initial position of a particle in the surface can be identified either by (32) or\nby (33).

However, we can always assume the interface to be\ncomposed of a fixed set of particles, as in section 3.3. For a quantity S0 continuously defined\nR\nover such an interface \u00c30 , we write S0 = \u00c30 \u03c6S d\u00c3.

Comparing the last equation with the\nReynolds transport theorem for material volumes (24) shows an additional term related to\nthe moving surface.\n\n19\n\n\fThe last equation of (48) can be transformed further. In this section we derive the divergence theorem for surfaces, which will be used here and again in section 4.3, so that we\nderive it using the abbreviation f = \u03c6S v S .

This\ninterface balance equation includes phase change, but to also include surface tension, a balance\nequation for the interface itself has to be formulated, which is then added to the balance\nequation for the bulk phases.\nThe material about balance equations in general is mainly based on [BiStLi] and [Sl99].\nFurther on [De] and [Hu]. The material about interface balance equations is mainly based\non [TrTo], [Sl07] and [Ed]. Some recent references on two phase flow problems are [IsHi], [Ko]\nand [GaPr].\n\n4.1 Balance equations for bulk fluids\nBalance equations are formulated for physical quantities that are continuously defined over a\nspatial region (for instances a volume), such as mass, momentum or energy. We denote those\nR\nquantities by B = V \u03c6 dV .\n\nBalance equation for a material volume A material (mass conserving) volume V0 is in\nR\ngeneral moving with time. A balance equation for a physical quantity B0 = V0 \u03c6 dV in a\nmaterial volume states that the rate of accumulation of the quantity in the material volume\nis given by an conductive flux of the quantity (not connected to mass) that enters the volume\nacross the surface plus supply of the quantity to the material volume6\nI\nZ\nZ\nd\n\u03c6 dV = \u2212 \u03b6 * dA + \u03c0 dV ,\n(52)\ndt\nV0\n\n6\n\nSome authors distinguish between supply of quantity to the volume and production of quantity within the\nvolume. Then conservation equations can be defined as balance equations without a production term.\nHowever, it is more intuitive to distinguish only between surface terms and volume terms.\n\n21\n\n\fwhere \u03b6 is the efflux density and \u03c0 is the supply density. The surface element vector dA =\nn dA is directed outwards, normal to the surface. As before we drop the integration limits\nexcept in the case, where the derivative of the integral is taken. With the Reynolds transport\ntheorem (24) the balance equation (52) for a material volume becomes\n\u0013\nZ \u0012\nI\nZ\n\u2202\u03c6\n+ \u2207 * [\u03c6 v] dV = \u2212 \u03b6 * dA + \u03c0 dV .\n(53)\n\u2202t\nBalance equation for a stationary volume To derive a balance equation for a stationary\nvolume the Reynolds transport theorem in the form of (25) is substituted for the right hand\nside of (52)\nI\nI\nZ\nZ\n\u2202\u03c6\ndV + \u03c6 v * dA = \u2212 \u03b6 * dA + \u03c0 dV .\n\u2202t\nNow the integration domain of the volume integral on the left hand side is constant and\ndifferentiation and integration can be interchanged.

Surface mass is assumed to have similar properties as three-dimensional mass,\nsuch as surface density, surface viscosity, surface tension and so on. Then, analogous to the\nbalance equation of three dimensional continua, a balance equation for the interface can be\ngiven. Adding this derived interface balance equation to the balance equation for a material\nvolume with a singular interface gives a balance equation which includes surface tension.\n\nBalance equation for a surface The interface between condensate and vapor is not material,\nthe fluid velocity differs from the velocity of the surface. Nevertheless a balance equation\nsimilar to the balance equation (52) for a material volume can be given, as explained in\nR\nsection 3.3. For a quantity S0 continuously defined over a surface \u00c3 we write S0 = \u00c3 \u03c6S d\u00c3.\nThen a balance equation for S0 states that the rate of accumulation of surface quantity in\nthe surface \u00c3 is given by conductive flux of surface quantity across the boundary curve of the\n\n24\n\n\fsurface plus supply of surface quantity at the surface\nI\nZ\nZ\nd\n\u03c6S d\u00c3 = \u2212 \u03b6 S * dC\u0303 + \u03c0S d\u00c3 ,\ndt\n\n(58)\n\n\u00c3\n\nwhere \u03b6 S is the surface flux density and \u03c0S is the surface supply density.

We made no additional assumption other than assume a continuous surface, in\nparticular we do not allow the interface to break off.\n\n5 Model equations with phase change and surface tension\nIn this section the balance equations for mass, momentum and energy for two incompressible\nfluids and for the interface between them are obtained and we discuss appropriate simplifications. In the last section we summarize the deduced system of partial differential equations\nincluding the jump conditions and discuss boundary conditions for the system of partial differential equations.\n\n5.1 Mass, momentum and energy equation\nMass The mass balance equation for an incompressible fluid is given by (55) with \u03c6 = \u03c1\nand \u03b6 = \u03c0 = 0\n\u2202\u03c1\n+ \u2207 * (\u03c1 v) = 0 ,\n\u2202t\n\n(63)\n\nwhich gives with the assumption of constant density\n\u2207*v =0.\n\n(64)\n\nIf the Mach number of a fluid is small compared to unity the fluid can be considered as an\nincompressible fluid [BiStLi].\nFor momentum and energy another balance equation which makes use of (63) is more\npreferable. For that we substitute \u03c6 in (55) by \u03c1 \u03c8, apply product rule on both terms on the\n\n26\n\n\fleft side and receive\n\u2202(\u03c1 \u03c8)\n+ \u2207 * [(\u03c1 \u03c8) v] = \u03c8\n\u2202t\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0015\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202\u03c1\n+ \u2207 * (\u03c1 v) +\u03c1\n+ v * \u2207\u03c8 .\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n{z\n}\n|\n\u0014\n\n=0\n\nThe first bracket is zero according to (63). The second bracket is the material derivative of \u03c8\nas derived in section 3.1.\n\u2202\u03c8\nD\u03c8\n=\n+ v * \u2207\u03c8 .\nDt\n\u2202t\nThus we get the generic balance equation (55) in an equivalent form\n\u03c1\n\nD\u03c8\nDt\n\n= \u2212\u2207 * \u03b6 + \u03c0 ,\n\n(65)\n\nMomentum The momentum equation we get by substituting in (65) \u03c8 = v, \u03b6 = \u2212S and\n\u03c0 = \u03c1 g (where \u03c8 and \u03c0 are vectors and \u03b6 is a second order tensor)\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u2202v\n+ v * \u2207v = \u2207 * S + \u03c1 g .\n(66)\n\u03c1\n\u2202t\nThe stress tensor can be divided into a contribution of the fluid at rest and the fluid in motion,\nS = \u2212p I + T . The body force vector is the gravity vector g assuming that there are no other\nbody forces.\nIf the fluids are Newtonian (linearly viscous) fluids the (deviatoric part of the) stress tensor\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2032\nfor both phases is given by T = \u03bc \u2207v + (\u2207v)T + \u03bc3 (\u2207 * v), with shear viscosity \u03bc and\nmodified bulk viscosity \u03bc\u2032 . Together with the incompressibility condition the momentum\nequation\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u2202v\n+ v * \u2207v = \u2212\u2207p + \u03bc \u22072 v + \u03c1 g\n\u03c1\n\u2202t\nthen forms the well known Navier-Stokes equations.\nNote that if we had derived the momentum equation from (55), the divergence term in the\nconvective term would be nonlinear. The advantage of deriving the momentum equation from\n(65) is that the divergence term is then linear which makes numerical discretization easier.\n\n27\n\n\fEnergy According to the first law of thermodynamics the increase of internal and kinetic\nenergy in a material control volume is given by heat supply plus power due to work acting on\nthe fluid. The differential equation governing the energy is\n\u0012\n\u0013\nv2\nD\ne+\n= (\u2207 * [Sv] + \u03c1 g * v) + (\u2212\u2207 * q + \u03c1 z) ,\n(67)\n\u03c1\nDt\n2\n\nwhere e is the internal energy per unit mass, Sv is the power due to surface forces per unit\narea, \u03c1 g * v is the gravity power per unit volume, q the heat flux per unit area and z the heat\n2\nproduction per unit volume, which is zero in our case. Here \u03c8 = e + v2 , \u03b6 = \u2212Sv + q and\n\u03c0 = \u03c1 g *v +\u03c1 z. To get the energy in a more commonly used form, we subtract the mechanical\nenergy equation from (67). The mechanical energy equation is formed by the scalar product\nof momentum equation and velocity. By this we get7\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2202e\n\u03c1\n+ v * \u2207e = \u2212\u2207 * q + S \u2022 \u2207v .\n\u2202t\n\nAssuming that the heating effect of friction can be neglected, the dissipative term T \u2022 \u2207v is\nzero. Moreover, S \u2022 \u2207v vanishes since S \u2022 \u2207v = T \u2022 \u2207v \u2212 p (I \u2022 \u2207v) = \u2212p (\u2207 * v) = 0.\nConstitutive equations for internal energy and heat flux complete the equations. For small\ntemperature differences internal energy can be described by a linear function e = c (T \u2212 T0 ) +\ne(T0 ), where c is the specific heat capacity. The heat flux is given by Fourier's law q = \u2212\u03bb\u2207T ,\nwhere \u03bb is the heat conductivity. This results in the heat equation\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2202T\n\u03c1c\n+ v * \u2207T\n= \u03bb \u22072 T .\n\u2202t\n\nThe material properties viscosity, heat capacity and heat conductivity are in general functions of density, pressure and temperature, but for incompressible fluids only temperature\ndependency need to be considered. If the temperature interval between the two phases is\nsmall the material properties can be assumed to be constant.\n\n5.2 Mass, momentum and energy jump conditions\nMass We start with (62). Assuming the bulk variables \u03c6 = \u03c1 and \u03b6 = 0, and the surface\nvariable \u03b6 S = 0, gives for the mass jump condition at the interface\nhh\ni\n\u03c1 [v \u2212 u] * n = 0 .\n(68)\n\nEquation (68) states that the amount of mass flux that enters the interface must also leave\nthe interface \u1e41l = \u1e41g (so we can omit the index).\n7\n\nHere we used the identity \u2207 * (Sv) = (\u2207 * S) * v + S\n\n\u2022\n\n28\n\n\u2207v\n\n\fMomentum To get the momentum jump condition at the surface between condensate and\nvapor, we set in (62) \u03c6 = \u03c1 v, \u03b6 = \u2212S and \u03b6 S = \u2212S S . As for the stress tensor, the surface\nstress tensor can be divided into two components S S = \u03c3I S + T S , where I S is the surface\nidentity tensor (9). Assuming a surface without mass we have T S = 0 and from the surface\nstress tensor, only the interfacial tension remains S S = \u03c3 I S , where \u03c3 is the surface tension\ncoefficient, see section 4.3. Surface tension can be understood as the counterpart of the\npressure in the bulk fluid. With this substitution the momentum jump condition becomes\ni hh\ni\nhh\n\u03c1v [v \u2212 u] * n \u2212 Sn = \u2207S \u03c3 + 2 H \u03c3 n .\n(69)\n\nIf we neglect temperature dependency of the surface tension coefficient (no Marangony effects)\n\u03c3 is constant within the surface.\nWe split the vector equation (69) into three scalar equations by multiplying it first with the\nnormal vector and then with the two tangential vectors. The tangential equations are equal,\nso we skip the third equation and use the symbol t to denote both hhtangential\nvectors. Further\ni\nwe make use of (68) and the assumption of no-slip at the surface v * t = 0. Then we get\nhh\n\ni hh i hh\ni\n\u1e41 v * n + p \u2212 n * T n = 2 H \u03c3 ,\nhh\ni\nt * Tn = 0 .\n\n(70)\n(71)\n2\n\nEnergy The energy jump condition is with \u03c6 = \u03c1 (e+ v2 ), \u03b6 = \u2212Sv+q, \u03b6 S = (\u2212\u03c3 I S + T S ) u =\n\u2212\u03c3 u and by making the same assumptions as for the momentum jump condition given by\n\u0013\nhh \u0012\ni hh\ni h\ni\n\u0001\nv2\n\u03c1 e+\n[v \u2212 u] * n \u2212 n * Sv + q * n = \u2207S * \u03c3 u + 2 H \u03c3 n * u ,\n(72)\n2\nwhere e is the internal energy. Instead of a balance equation for the internal energy a formulation with the enthalpy h = e + p\u03c1 is more convenient, because enthalpy is a measurable\nquantity whereas internal energy is not easy to measure.\nWriting n * Sv = v * Sn (S is symmetric), splitting the vectors on the left side of (72) into\ntheir normal and tangential components according to a * b = (a * n)(b * n) + (a * t)(b * t), and\n\u0001\napplying the chain rule to \u2207S * \u03c3 u gives\nhh\n\n\u0012\n\n(v * n)2 (v * t)2\n\u1e41 e +\n+\n2\n2\n\n\u0013i\n\nhh\nii hh\ni\n\u2212 (v * n) (n * Sn) + (v * t) (t * Sn) + q * n\n\n= \u03c3 \u2207S * u + u * \u2207S \u03c3 + 2 H \u03c3 n * u .

One more equation is missing and\nfor this we take the condition of thermodynamic equilibrium at the interface, according to\nwhich the fluid temperatures are equal at the moving surface\nTl = Tg .\n\n(76)\n\nFrom the five jump conditions we need one equation to calculate the mass flux, so that\nfour equations remain to calculate the boundary conditions for three velocity components,\npressure and temperature. We can use either the mass jump condition or the energy jump\ncondition to calculate the mass flux.\nFrom the remaining equations either the mass jump condition or the normal momentum\njump condition can be used to calculate one velocity boundary condition, depending on which\nequation is used to compute the mass flux. Which of the two equations is used depends on\nfurther simplifications of the problem. Often the term with the mass flux in the normal\nmomentum jump condition is small and can be dropped, then this equation is not available\nto calculate the mass flux.\nThe second and third velocity boundary condition are taken from the tangential momentum\njump conditions.\nSI Units of some variables and material properties\n\n32\n\n\fH\nS\nT\nT\nc\ne\ng\n\u03b1\n\u2206h\n\u1e41\np\nq\nu, v\n\u03bc\n\u03bb\n\u03c1\n\u03c3\n\nm\u22121\nN m\u22122\nN m\u22122\nK\nJ kg\u22121 K\u22121\nJ kg\u22121\nm s\u22122\nW m\u22122 K\u22121\nJ kg\u22121\nkg s\u22121 m3\nN m\u22122\nJ m\u22122 s\u22121\nm s\u22121\nkg m\u22121 s\u22121\nW m\u22121 K\u22121\nkg m\u22123\nN m\u22121\n\nmean curvature\nstress tensor (J = kg m s\u22122 )\nviscous stress tensor\ntemperature (C = K - 273,15)\nspecific heat capacity (J = N m)\nspecific internal energy\ngravity vector (g = 9, 81 m s\u22122 )\nheat transfer coefficient (W = J s\u22122 )\nlatent heat of vaporization\nvolume specific mass flux\npressure\nheat flux vector\nvelocity\ndynamical viscosity\nthermal conductivity\ndensity\nsurface tension\n\nReferences\n[Ap]\n\nTom M.
