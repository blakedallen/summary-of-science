In 1990, especially, Datta and Das proposed\na spin transistor in which electron spin can be manipulated by varying electric fields via spin-orbit couplings\n(SOCs) [2]. Spin transport have been intensively investigated in various types of such spin field-effect transistors (SFETs) in associations with spin filters or polarizers, spin currents, spin valves, and so on. However, the\ndevice working performances have not been studied yet\nmuch. Even the device performance rates in SFETs seem\nto be much lower than in charge field-effect transistors\n(FETs). Actually, for instance, the on/off current ratio\nis smaller than 103 in a SFET with T -shaped structure [3]\nas well as that in a dual-gate SFET [4]. On the contrary,\ncharge field-effect transistors have reached a higher performance rate. Indeed, recent high-mobility FETs using\nZnO nanorods [5], poly(3-hexylthiophene) thin film [6],\ncarbon nanotubes [7], and p-GaN/u-Alx Ga1\u2212x N/u-GaN\njunction heterostructure [8] have been demonstrated with\n104 \u223c 106 on/off current ratios. Since spin coherence can\nbe more fragile than charge decoherence, device disorders\nmay also spoil the performance rate more significantly in\nSFETs than in charge field-effect transistors.\nIn this paper, we propose a SFET with high performance rate. To do this, we introduce a quantum wire\nwith Rashba SOC modulations [9]. A local Rashba SOC\nin a quantum wire gives rise to a spin-dependent Fano\neffect that is the quantum interference of electron propagating through both the continuum energy channel and a\nlocalized electronic state resulting from the SOC. Due to\nthe Rashba-Fano effect, electron transmission has asymmetric antiresonance dips [10, 11, 12]. Further, the periodic SOC modulation makes the energy range of van-\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic view of quantum wire with periodic local\nRashba couplings. The width and length of the quantum\nwire are Lw and L, respectively. The gray areas represent\neach Rashba region with its length Lb . The length of normal\nregions without SOC is La . In the text, an integer N denotes\nthe number of Rashba regions.\n\nishingly small electron transmission broader. This allows\nus a large on/off current ratio by tuning the SOC modulations. Even for a strong device disorder, the proposed\nSFET is shown to have higher performance rate with\nlarger on/off current ratio than about 105 .\n\nII.\n\nMODEL AND FORMALISM\n\nA quantum wire under consideration is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe wire of length L is connected to two ideal leads. Its\nwidth is Lw , which determines the transverse propagating channels. The Rashba SOC is controlled in the gray\nregions with its length Lb , while the normal regions without the SOC has their size La . The number of Rashba\nregions is denoted by N . We apply a weak uniform perpendicular magnetic field, which guarantees that Landau levels are neglected, in the whole device including\nthe leads. The Zeeman effect splits the on-site electronic\nenergy into V\u03c3 = \u03c3V0 with \u03c3 = \u00b1 for spin-up (\u2191) and\n-down (\u2193).

G1M\nand GM1 are the retarded and advanced\nGreen's functions [15], respectively. Here, \u03bc1 (\u03bc2 ) is the\nFermi energy of the left (right) lead.\nThe energies of the transverse propagating channels\nare given by \u03b5n = 2t{1 \u2212 cos[n\u03c0/(Lw /a + 1)]} with the\nchannel index n. We consider the lowest energy channel\nn = 1. In our numerical calculation, the lowest energy\nis \u01eb1 \u2243 0.081t for Lw = 10a. It is assumed that only\nspin-down electrons can propagate into or out of the wire\nstructure. To make it sure, the Fermi energy EF can\nbe adjusted as the energy between \u03b51 \u2212 V0 and \u03b51 + V0 .\nThus, only T \u2193\u2193 is responsible for electron transport, i.e.,\nthe total transmission amplitude becomes T = T \u2193\u2193 .\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn Fig. 2, we plot the transmission amplitude as a function of Fermi energy for N = 9 and \u03bb = 0.13t. Numerical parameters were chosen as V0 = 0.01t, Lb = 10a,\nLa = 3Lb and Lw = Lb . Note that due to the serial SOC modulations the electron transmission is vanishingly small in a wide range of energy. Roughly, the\nenergy range is from EF = 0.076t to EF = 0.084t. This\ncan play a significant role for the device performance, i.e.,\nparticularly the off current. To show clearly the effects\nof periodic Rashba SOC modulations, in Fig. 3 (a), the\ntransmission amplitudes are plotted for N = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9,\nand 12. It is shown that the gap where the vanishingly\nsmall transmission happens becomes wider and deeper\nas the number of Rashba SOC regions increases. Also,\ninside the gap, Fano-Rashba antiresonances appear to\ngive a much smaller transmission through the quantum\nwire, which can provide smaller off currents. Further, as\nthe SOC strength decreases, one find a high transmission\nwithin the gap. In Fig. 3 (b), the high transmission for\n\u03bb = 0.08t is shown in the energy range of low transmission for \u03bb = 0.13t. The high transmission in the gap does\nnot change very much as the number of SOC regions increases. Then, this may provide a high current as an on\ncurrent.\n\n\f3\n0.005\n\n\"on\"\n\n0.003\n\nIon/Ioff\n\nI [et/h]\n\n0.004\n\n0.002\n0.001\n\n\"off\"\n0.000\n0.00\n\n0.04\n\n0.08\n\n0.12\n\n0.16\n\n10\n\n13\n\n10\n\n12\n\n10\n\n11\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n9\n\n10\n\n8\n\n10\n\n7\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0.00\n\nN=9\n\n\u00d710\nN=3\n0.01\n\n\u03bb/t\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n-7\n\n1.0\n\nW=0.00\n0.01t\n0.02t\n0.03t\n0.04t\n\n0.8\n0.6\n\nT\n\nT\n\n10\n\n0.4\n\nN=3\n\u03bb=0.13t\n\n(a)\n0.075\n\n0.078\n\n0.081\n\n0.084\n\nN=3\n\u03bb=0.08t\n\n0.2\n\n(b)\n0.0\n0.075\n\n0.087\n\n0.078\n\nEF/t\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n10\n\n-10\n\n10\n\n-12\n\n10\n\n-14\n\n10\n\n-16\n\n0.075\n\n0.084\n\n0.087\n\nEF/t\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n0.081\n\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n\nT\n\nT\n\n10\n10\n\n0.4\n\nN=9\n\u03bb=0.13t\n\n(c)\n0.078\n\n0.081\n\nEF/t\n\n0.084\n\n0.087\n\n0.2\n\n(d)\n0.0\n0.075\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\n\nW/t\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Spin transport current as a function\nof the Rashba SOC strength for N = 9.

It should be noted that there are\nthree regimes of spin current as the SOC varies, i.e., (i)\nhigh current regime (0 \u2264 \u03bb . 0.1 t), (ii) transit current regime (0.1 t . \u03bb . 0.12 t), and (iii) low current\nregime (0.12 t . \u03bb). For instance, from the numerical\ncalculation, we obtain the on/off current ratios: 1 \u00d7 104\nfor N = 3, 2.7 \u00d7 1012 for N = 9, and 6.8 \u00d7 1015 for\nN = 12. Then, our SFETs show the high device performance with the on/off current ratio bigger than that of\nEFTs in Refs. 5, 6, 7, 8 and 16.\nDevice disorders can destroy spin coherence. Thus, the\ndevice performance may be spoiled severely due to the\ndisorders. Figure 5 shows the effects of the Anderson disorders on electron transmission in (a) and (b) for N = 3\n\nFIG. 6: (Color online) On-to-off current ratios Ion /Ioff as a\nfunction of the Anderson disorder strength W for N = 3 and\nN = 9.\n\nand in (c) and (d) for N = 9. The transmission amplitudes were averaged over 1\u00d7104 configurations for N = 3\nand 3\u00d7104 configurations for N = 9. It is shown that the\nvanishingly small transmissions within the gaps become\nlarger as the disorder strength W increases. However, the\ntransmission amplitudes are still smaller than T . 10\u22125\neven for the stronger disorder W = 0.04t, which guarantees a high performance of our SFETs. This is clearly\nshown in Fig. 6. The on/off current ratio decreases as\nthe Anderson disorder strength becomes stronger. For\nN = 3, relatively, a mild spoil of device performance occurs because the ratios are Ion /Ioff \u2243 1 \u00d7 104 for W = 0.0\nand Ion /Ioff \u2243 0.89 \u00d7 103 for W = 0.04t. For N = 9, the\nquantum wire without the disorder has a extremely large\non/off current ratio Ion /Ioff \u2243 2.7 \u00d7 1012 . The strong\ndisorder W = 0.04t gives rise to strong spin decoherence\nand the on/off current ratio becomes Ion /Ioff \u2243 3.0\u00d7105.\nHowever, this shows that the device performance is still\ngood enough for a SFET. As a result, the quantum wires\nwith the spin-dependent modulations can provide a high\nperformance SFET even though the strong disorder destroys spin coherence severely.\n\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn summary, we have proposed the quantum wires with\nperiodic local Rashba SOCs as a spin transistor. The device shows a good device performance as a SEFT with\nextremely large on/off current ratios, although strong device disorders destroy spin coherence.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 10725417, the National Basic Research Program of China under Grant No.\n2006CB922005 and the Knowledge Innovation Project of\nChinese Academy of Sciences.
