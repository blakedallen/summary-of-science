INTRODUCTION\n\nUntil relatively recently, our understanding of the\nchemical abundance distributions of the Milky Way disk\nhas been shaped by objects predominantly located in\nthe Galactocentric distance range of Rgc \u223c7\u201316 kpc3 .\nSuch distributions have been determined using objects\nfor which distances can be determined, such as open clusters, Cepheids, H II regions, planetary nebulae and young\nOB stars, predominantly in the Galactic anticenter (l\n\u223c180\u25e6), where the line of sight is relatively less obscured\nby dust and overcrowding. The abundance distributions\n(e.g., of [Fe/H], log N(O), etc.) shown in this Galactocentric distance range have been generally characterized\nas linearly-dependent on Rgc , with the more distant ob1 The WIYN Observatory is a joint facility of the University\nof Wisconsin-Madison, Indiana University, Yale University, and\nthe National Optical Astronomy Observatory.\n2 National Science Foundation Astronomy and Astrophysics\nPostdoctoral Fellow.\n3 Note R\ngc,\u2299 , depending on the study, is generally taken to be\n\u223c8\u20138.5 kpc.\n\njects being more metal-poor than objects closer to the\nGalactic center. Astronomers have more often than not\nchosen to draw linear gradients due to the relatively small\nsample sizes they were working with. That said, Twarog\net al. (1997) proposed an alternative view for their sample of 76 open clusters within the range Rgc \u223c7\u201316 kpc.\nThey found that a bimodal distribution, with clusters\ninside Rgc = 10 kpc having [Fe/H] = 0.00, and clusters\noutside Rgc = 10 kpc having [Fe/H] = \u22120.30, better fit\nthe metallicity distribution than a simple linear gradient.\nWithin the past ten years or so, a number of chemical abundance studies have extended the Galactocentric distance range of several populations, and rather\nunsurprisingly, the resulting element abundance distributions have shown themselves to be more complicated\nthan the early linear gradients. For example, Andrievsky\net al. (2002b) determined chemical abundances for five\nCepheids in the Rgc range 4\u20136 kpc (where Rgc,\u2299 = 7.9\nkpc). The combination of these results with a sample of Cepheids with Rgc \u223c6\u201311 kpc (Andrievsky et al.\n2002a) showed the Cepheid metallicity gradient sharply\n\n\f2\n\nJacobson, Pilachowski & Friel\nTable 1\nClusters Observed\n\nCluster\nM 67\nNGC\nNGC\nNGC\nNGC\nNGC\nNGC\nNGC\nNGC\nNGC\n\n188\n1245\n1817\n2158\n2194\n2355\n2420\n2425\n7789\n\nl\n(deg.)\n\nb\n(deg.)\n\nE(B\u2212V)\n\n215.6\n122.8\n146.6\n186.1\n186.6\n197.3\n203.4\n198.1\n231.5\n115.5\n\n+31.7\n+22.5\n\u22128.9\n\u221213.1\n+1.8\n\u22122.3\n+11.8\n+19.6\n+3.3\n\u22125.4\n\n0.04\u00b10.02\n0.09\u00b10.02\n0.21\u00b10.03\n0.27\u00b10.05\n0.430\u00b10.013\n0.45\u00b10.02\n0.16\n0.050\u00b10.004\n0.29\u00b10.05\n0.28\u00b10.03\n\nRef.a\n11\n8\n3\n2\n5\n7\n9\n1\n6\n4\n\nd\n(kpc)\n\nRgc b\n(kpc)\n\nz\n(pc)\n\nRef.a\n\n0.83\u00b10.02\n1.70\u00b10.07\n3.0\u00b10.3\n1.5\u00b10.5\n4.0\u00b10.1\n1.9\u00b10.1\n1.9\u00b10.1\n2.5\u00b10.3\n3.3\u00b10.2\n2.2\u00b10.2\n\n9.09\u00b10.02\n9.4\u00b10.1\n11.1\u00b10.3\n10.0\u00b10.4\n12.5\u00b10.1\n10.3\u00b10.2\n10.3\u00b10.1\n10.7\u00b10.3\n10.6\u00b10.1\n9.6\u00b10.2\n\n+440\u00b110\n+650\u00b130\n\u2212460\u00b150\n\u2212340\u00b1100\n+130\u00b15\n\u221280\u00b15\n+400\u00b120\n+830\u00b1100\n190\u00b110\n\u2212200\u00b120\n\n10\n8\n10\n2\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n\nAgec\n(Gyr)\n\n# Stars\n\n4.3\n6.3\n1.1\n1.1\n1.9\n0.9\n0.8\n2.2\n2.5d\n1.8\n\n31\n51\n24\n72\n36\n18\n12\n22\n31\n44\n\na\n\nReferences for cluster reddening and/or distance: (1) Anthony-Twarog et al. 2006; (2) Balaguer-N\u00fa\u00f1ez et al. 2004b; (3) Burke et al. 2004;\n(4) Gim et al. 1998b; (5) Grochalski & Sarajedini 2002; (6) Pietrukowicz et al. 2006; (7) Sanner et al. 2000; (8) Sarajedini et al. 1999; (9)\nSoubiran et al. 2000; (10) This Study; (11) Twarog et al. 1997.\nb R\n\u2299 = 8.5 kpc\nc Adopted from Salaris et al.

(2006)\n\nincreased inside Rgc \u223c6.5 kpc.\nIn the opposite direction, high resolution spectroscopic\nstudies of very distant open clusters have extended our\nreach nearly 23 kpc from the center of the Galaxy. Our\nunderstanding of the Galactic disk beyond Rgc \u223c13 kpc\nrests on roughly a dozen open clusters. The first studies\nof these outer disk clusters (Carraro et al. 2004, Yong\net al. 2005) lent support to the view of Twarog et al.\n(1997) that the metallicity distribution differs between\nthe outer disk and the inner disk. The increasingly large\nnumber of detailed abundance studies of open clusters\nhave made it clear that the abundance gradients of the\ninner disk flatten out at Rgc \u223c9\u201314 kpc, and remain relatively independent of Galactocentric distance for some\n10 kpc in the outer disk (e.g, Carraro et al. 2007). This\ntrend is seen not only in the traditional metallicity gradient (i.e., [Fe/H]) for open clusters, but in trends of other\nelement [X/H] ratios with Rgc (e.g., Magrini et al. 2009).\nHowever, the nature of the transition from gradient to\nplateau is poorly constrained. Is there a sharp break, or\nis there a large dispersion in abundances in the transition region? How does the abundance dispersion in the\ntransition region compare to those in the inner and outer\ndisks?\nIn the effort to address these questions, we have assembled a sample of 20 open clusters located in the transition region. A robust determination of their elemental\nabundances based on observations of as many confirmed\ncluster member stars as possible in a self-consistent and\nhomogeneous fashion will allow us to better trace the\ndispersions in cluster element abundances in the transition area of the disk. A little more than half our sample\nhas been presented in previous papers. These include\ndetailed abundances of old open clusters based on single\nstar, multi-order echelle spectra obtained with 4m class\ntelescopes (Friel et al. 2005, 2010, Jacobson et al. 2008,\n2009), and of two Southern hemisphere clusters observed\nwith the Hydra multi-object spectrograph on the CTIO\n4m telescope (Jacobson et al. 2011). In this paper, we\npresent results for the remainder of the clusters in our\nsample observed with the WIYN 3.5m telescope. Results\nfor four of these clusters have been presented previously\nin Jacobson et al. (2009; NGC 1817, NGC 2158) and Friel\n\net al. (2010; M 67, NGC 188); the analysis presented\nhere both complements and adds to that work, allowing\nus not only to directly compare to previous results but\nto increase the number of stars used to determine mean\ncluster abundances.\n2. TARGET SELECTION AND OBSERVATIONS\n\nAssembly of our cluster sample was constrained by the\nefficiency and throughput of the Hydra spectrograph on\nthe WIYN 3.5m telescope. To obtain a signal-to-noise\nratio (S/N) of \u223c70 per pixel generally requires \u223c6 hours'\nintegration time for stars with V\u223c15 observed in conditions of moderate seeing, light cirrus and bright moon.\nWe selected clusters in the direction of the Galactic anticenter that contained a large enough sample (preferably a\ndozen or more) of potential cluster members with V\u223c15\nor brighter. Table 1 lists the clusters for which stellar\nspectra of sufficient S/N ratio (\u223c70 or higher) allowed\nfor detailed abundance analysis. Of these clusters, M 67\nand NGC 188 have been studied in great detail, and as\nalready mentioned, they and NGC 1817 and NGC 2158\nwere studied previously by us. Of the remaining clusters, NGC 2194, NGC 2425 and to a lesser extent, NGC\n2355 are relatively little-studied to date, while NGC 1245\nhas been the subject of planet searches but not chemical\nabundance analysis (e.g., Burke et al. 2004, 2006; Pepper & Burke 2006). To our knowledge, only NGC 2355\nhas been subject to spectroscopic study (Soubiran et al.\n2000), but in this analysis stellar [Fe/H] values were determined by comparison of spectra to a library of stars\nwith known parameters, rather than via a \"classical\" detailed abundance analysis based on measurement of individual spectral lines. NGC 7789 is another classic, old\nopen cluster; Tautvai\u0161ien\u0117 et al. (2005) and Pancino et\nal. (2010) presented detailed abundance analyses of several evolved stars in NGC 7789, which will serve as a\nuseful comparison to our work. Brief descriptions and\nsummaries of previous studies of individual clusters are\ngiven in Appendix A.\nPrimary stellar targets were red clump stars, with\nbrighter red giant stars serving as secondary targets.\nNGC 188 has no identifiable red clump, so all evolved\nstars were selected for observation.

This, combined with constraints on fiber placement, often greatly limited the\nnumber of targets it was possible to observe. As there\nwas generally only time enough to observe one field configuration per cluster, the number of stars observed was\nsometimes limited to \u223c12 or so per field. As will be seen,\nexamination of radial velocities often showed only a much\nsmaller number of stars were actually cluster members.\nThe majority of the observations were obtained with\nthe Hydra fiber positioner and bench spectrograph on the\nWIYN 3.5m telescope from 2006 December through 2008\nDecember. Table 1 gives a summary of the observations,\nincluding UT date of observations, central wavelength,\nand the number and length of exposures. Most clusters\nwere observed in more than one observing run, and each\nis listed separately.\nWe used the bench spectrograph camera and the redoptimized 200 \u03bcm fiber cables. The echelle 613 lines\nmm\u22121 grating along with the X18 filter at 9th order were\nused to obtain single order \u223c300 \u00c5 spectra centered at\n\u223c6280 \u00c5. This wavelength range was selected because it\nincludes the Na \u03bb6154/6160 \u00c5 doublet, the [O I] \u03bb6300\n\u00c5 feature, and a handful of Mg, Si, Ca, Ti and Ni lines,\nas well as \u223c20 Fe I lines. Comparison of cluster \u03b1 element abundances to metallicity will yield information\nabout the relative contributions of Type II and Type\nIa supernovae, and thus any trends of [\u03b1/Fe] with Rgc\nwould indicate differences in chemical evolutionary history. Na abundances are also interesting, as many open\nclusters have been found to have enhanced light element\nabundances relative to field stars (Friel 2006).\nMost data were taken with the T2KA CCD detector\n(2048x2048 pixels, 24 \u03bcm in size), with the spectra generally having a resolution (\u03bb/\u2206\u03bb) R\u223c18 000, based on measurement of the FWHM of ThAr lines. In the weeks prior\nto the 2008 December observing run, the bench spectrograph was updated with a new collimator and new CCD,\nSTA-1. The new CCD has 2600x4000 12 \u03bcm pixels, and\n\nwe observed in binned 2x2 mode. The new collimator\nincreased the throughput, allowing us to achieve minimum desired S/N ratios in fewer integrations. What is\nmore, the spectra obtained with STA-1 have a spectral\nresolution of R\u223c21 000 due to its higher dispersion (0.07\n\u00c5 pix\u22121 compared to 0.15 \u00c5 pix\u22121 for T2KA). Given\nthe better quality of these 2008 December spectra, both\nin terms of S/N and spectral resolution, only these data\nfor NGC 2425 and NGC 2158 were used in the abundance analysis (though all spectra were used for radial\nvelocity determination). The field configuration of NGC\n1817 obtained in 2008 December was different from that\nobtained in 2006 December, so both data sets were analyzed. Calibration data obtained each evening of each\nobserving run included 3\u201310 flat field images, 2\u20133 twilight sky exposures, 9\u201315 bias frames, and one 10 minute\nThAr spectrum for wavelength calibration. Spectra of\nhot, rapidly-rotating early-type stars near each cluster's\nposition on the sky were obtained either before or after\ntarget observations. These were used for removal of telluric absorption features, particularly those near the [O\nI] \u03bb6300 \u00c5 feature.\nTargets in M 67 and NGC 2158 were observed at redder wavelengths earlier in 2006 as part of a program to\nstudy Na and Al abundances in open clusters. These Hydra echelle spectra, centered at roughly \u03bb6600 \u00c5, were\nobtained using the 613 lines mm\u22121 echelle grating with\nthe X19 filter at 8th order, and have a resolution of\nR\u223c14 500. The field configuration for M 67 used in these\nobservations is essentially identical to that of the 2007\nobservations, so all stars analyzed in this study have\nspectra in both wavelength ranges. The field configurations for NGC 2158 changed from one observing run\nto another, as radial velocity nonmembers were replaced\nwith other potential member stars. As a result, the field\nconfiguration used in 2006 differed enough from the 2008\nDecember configuration that only a few stars were observed in both wavelength regimes. Of these that turned\nout to be radial velocity members, only one star (3216)\nhad S/N ratios large enough in both wavelength ranges\n\n\f4\n\nJacobson, Pilachowski & Friel\n\nfor abundance analysis. Two confirmed radial velocity\nmembers (see below), 7773 and 7866, were only observed\nat \u03bb6600 \u00c5.\nInformation for each observed star, including J2000 coordinates and available optical and 2MASS4 photometry\n(Cutri et al. 2003) are given in Table 1. The sources for\nthe optical photometry and identification numbers are\nlisted in Appendix A for each cluster.\n3. DATA REDUCTION\n\nThe data were reduced using the usual routines in\nIRAF5 . Briefly, the individual frames were trimmed and\noverscan-subtracted. Bias frames were combined into\na master bias that was then subtracted from the rest\nof the images. The object frames were run through L.\nA. Cosmic, an iraf script developed by P. van Dokkum\n(2001) to remove cosmic rays. After aperture extraction, the one-dimensional spectra were flat fielded and\nthen dispersion corrected. Lastly, sky spectra from 10\u2013\n30 sky fibers uniformly distributed throughout the field\nof view were combined to create a single sky spectrum\nthat was subtracted from the stellar spectra. This effectively removed the telluric emission lines that plague the\n\u03bb\u223c6250\u20136350 \u00c5 region of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nThe individual spectra for each star were then summed\nto form a single, high S/N ratio spectrum, which was\nused for both preliminary radial velocity measurements\nand for the abundance analysis. The individual spectra\nwere used to measure the final stellar radial velocities, as\ndiscussed in Section 4.2. Figure 1 shows examples of the\ncombined, high S/N spectra used for abundance analysis.\n4. ANALYSIS\n4.1. Distance Determination\n\nAs in our previous work, we have attempted to place\nall clusters in our sample on a uniform distance scale.\nWe followed the methods of Grochalski & Sarajedini\n(2002; hereafter GS02) and Carney et al. (2005; hereafter CLD05) to determine a cluster's distance modulus and reddening based on the K-band magnitude and\n(J\u2212K) color of red giant clump stars. GS02 found MK\n= \u22121.6 for red clump stars over a wide range of cluster\nage and metallicity. For clusters outside of this range,\nFigure 6 in GS02 can be used to determine the appropriate MK value. CLD05 determined an empirical relation\nbetween a cluster's intrinsic (J\u2212K)0 color and [Fe/H],\nwhich, combined with the cluster's observed color, measures the cluster's color excess. This reddening value can\nthen be used along with the cluster's K magnitude to determine the absolute distance modulus, (K\u2212MK )0 .\nAll open clusters in our sample exhibit identifiable red\nclumps save for NGC 188 (see, e.g., Sarajedini et al.\n1999). Three clusters, M 67, NGC 1817, and NGC 2420,\nwere used by GS02 to calibrate their relation, so comparison of our distance and reddening determinations here\nwith literature values serves as validation of this method.\nDetails of the red clump star identifications and distance\nand reddening calculations are offered for each cluster\n4\n\nSee http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Gator/\nIRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which is operated by the Association of Universities for\nResearch in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with\nthe National Science Foundation.\n5\n\nin Appendix A. There the reader will find that in some\ncases identification of red clump stars proved difficult,\nand in all but two cases the interstellar extinction values\nare in disagreement with other determinations in the literature, sometimes by factors of two or more. However,\ngiven the relatively small dependence of K-band magnitudes on reddening, the corresponding distance moduli\nare in general good agreement with literature values. The\ncause of the discrepancy between these reddening determinations and those found by other methods is unclear,\nbut at least in some cases it is possibly due to incorrect\nidentification of red clump stars due to crowded CMDs\nand lack of membership information (see Appendix A for\ndetails).\nIt is important to note that the distances and reddenings determined by the red clump method have not been\nused to calculate atmospheric parameters for cluster stars\nas described in Section 4.4. As the color excesses found\nfrom clump (J\u2212K) colors were generally different from\nprevious determinations, and also as the clump star intrinsic (J\u2212K)0 given by the CLD05 relation is dependent\nupon metallicity, potentially large systematic uncertainties could be introduced into stellar effective temperatures. As a brief example, consider the case for NGC\n1817 (more details can be found in Appendix A). Depending on the adopted reddening for the cluster, stellar\neffective temperatures can vary by 300 K, and the resulting cluster [Fe/H] by 0.3 dex. As discussed below, comparison to the results for two NGC 1817 stars analyzed\nby us previously (Jacobson et al. 2009) found that the atmospheric parameters determined using a reddening and\ndistance modulus from the literature were in much better\nagreement than those calculated using the reddening and\ndistance modulus from the red clump method. Therefore, we have chosen photometric studies from the literature that we have deemed reliable for each cluster for the\ndetermination of atmospheric parameters; the distances\ncalculated by us using the cluster red clump morphology\nis used only in the discussion of cluster abundance trends\nwith location in the Galaxy. As already mentioned, and\nas can be seen in Appendix A, these distances are in\ngeneral good agreement with literature values.\n4.2. Radial Velocity Determination\nStellar radial velocities were determined using the fxcor task in IRAF. The primary motivation for determining radial velocities was to verify cluster membership for\neach stellar target; as a result, we used a twilight sky\nspectrum obtained in the same run as the target spectra\nfor the radial velocity template for each cross-correlation.\nHowever, in the 2008 December observing run, spectra\nof the late-type radial velocity standard HD 212943 were\nobtained and used as velocity templates. All individual\nspectra of stellar targets observed in previous observing\nruns were then cross-correlated against a spectrum of\nHD 212943 for final determination of radial velocities.\nThese velocities were corrected for heliocentric motion\nusing IRAF's rvcor routine. Final radial velocities for\neach star observed are given in Table 1. Stars that were\neither known to be spectroscopic binaries or were discovered to be so are also indicated.\nAgreement between our radial velocity values with\nthose of previous studies for most clusters is generally\nquite good (see below) and errors are relatively small.\n\n\fAbundances in Rgc \u223c9-13 kpc Open Clusters\n\n5\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\nFe I\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n6140\n\n6150\n\nNa I\n\nFe I\n\nFe I\n\n6160\n\nCa I\n\nFe I\n\nNi I\n\n6170\n\nFe I\n\n6180\n\n6190\n\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n\nAl I\n\nFe I\n\nFe I\n\nSi I Fe I\nCa I\n\nFe I\n\n0.5\n6680\n\n6700\n\n6720\n\nFigure 1.

The error in the zero point\nof our velocity scale can be estimated based on the radial velocity we determined for HD 212943 using a twilight sky spectrum as template: our value of 53.5 km s\u22121\nagrees well with the value of 54.3 km s\u22121 listed in the\nSIMBAD6 database for this star. Comparison to literature radial velocities for certain clusters below confirms that our velocities are on a common scale within 1\nkm s\u22121 .\nExtensive studies of proper motions and radial velocities exist in the literature for the clusters M 67, NGC 188,\nNGC 7789 and NGC 1817. Consequently, comparison of\nour radial velocities to the literature values serves as another estimation of errors in our measurements. For the\nless well-studied clusters, membership was determined\nby examination of histograms of stellar radial velocities,\nsuch as in Figure 2. In most cases, a clear peak in the histogram made membership identification straightforward.\nStars with velocities within 15 km s\u22121 of the adopted\ncluster mean velocity are tentatively identified as possible (binary star) cluster members (noted with M? in\nTable 1). We chose this value because \u223c20% of binary\nsystems can have semi-amplitudes as large as 20 km s\u22121\n(Mermilliod & Mayor 2007, Mermilliod et al. 2008).\nTo our knowledge, no previous radial velocity studies\nfor NGC 1245, NGC 2194 and NGC 2425 exist in the\nliterature. For these clusters, we have found mean radial velocities of \u221229.5\u00b11.0 km s\u22121 (N=15), +7.5\u00b10.8\n(N=7), and +102.9\u00b11.2 (N=10) km s\u22121 , respectively\n(Figure 2). More details about radial velocity and membership determination are given below. For the more\nwell-studied clusters, we also offer a brief comparison of\nour results to literature values.\n4.2.1. M 67\n\nAs we used the radial velocity study of Mathieu et al.\n(1986) and the proper motion study of Sanders (1977) to\nidentify targets for observation, all our targets in M 67\nsave one star were included in Mathieu et al. (1986), who\nfound a cluster mean Vr = +33.5\u00b12.8 km s\u22121 (65 stars).\nExcluding binary systems, the average difference between\nour velocities and those of Mathieu et al. is 0.5\u00b10.3 (s.d.)\nkm s\u22121 , with the Mathieu et al. values being larger. Star\n2152, which was not included in the Mathieu et al. study,\nis a cluster member, as shown by its radial velocity. We\nhave detected radial velocity variations of several known\nspectroscopic binaries in the cluster; these are indicated\nin Table 3. Star 286 also exhibited velocity variations; it\nhas been shown to exhibit variability (Stello et al. 2007),\nas described in the WEBDA database. The mean radial\nvelocity as determined by our cluster sample (excluding\nknown binaries and variable stars) is +33.3\u00b10.6 km s\u22121\n(N=22). This is in excellent agreement with the values\nfound by, e.g., Friel et al. (2002), who found a mean\nvalue of +33\u00b18 (s.d.; 25 stars) km s\u22121 for the cluster,\nand Mermilliod et al. (2007), who reported +33.7\u00b10.7\nkm s\u22121 based on 23 stars.\n6\n\nSee http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/\n\n4.2.2. NGC 188\n\nNGC 188 has been studied as part of the WIYN Open\nCluster Survey (WOCS; Mathieu 2000); consequently,\nmembership has been established via both proper motions (Platais et al. 2003) and radial velocities (Geller et\nal. 2008). We used the proper motion survey of Platais\net al. (2003) to identify stars for observation, and therefore the majority of our targets are included in the radial\nvelocity survey of Geller et al. (2008). Excluding spectroscopic binaries, the difference between our measured\nradial velocities and those of Geller et al. is 0.7\u00b10.5 (s.d.)\nkm s\u22121 , with our values being larger. As with M 67, we\nconfirmed the radial velocity variability of several stars\npreviously identified as spectroscopic binaries (Table 1).\nExcluding binary systems, we have found a mean cluster radial velocity of \u221241.9\u00b10.7 (s.d) km s\u22121 (N=40) for\nNGC 188. This compares well with the values found by\nGeller et al. (\u221242.36\u00b10.04 km s\u22121 using single member stars) and by Friel et al. (2002; \u221245\u00b110 km s\u22121 , 21\nstars). Stars 5212 and 6712 have radial velocities consistent with cluster membership, but have proper motion\nmembership probabilities of 26% and 6%, respectively\n(Platais et al. 2003). Therefore, they are given as possible members in Table 1.\n4.2.3. NGC 1245\n\nOf the 24 stars observed in this cluster field, the majority appear to have a common velocity. The radial velocity histogram for this cluster is highly peaked at \u221230\nkm s\u22121 (see Figure 2). Based on visual examination of\nthis peak, we have identified all stars with radial velocities between \u221235 km s\u22121 and \u221225 km s\u22121 to be cluster members; this results in a cluster mean velocity of\n\u221229.7\u00b11.2 km s\u22121 (N=16). Two other stars have velocities within 15 km s\u22121 of this value; they are considered\nas possible binary star members. NGC 1245 495 and 902\nare the only stars declared definite nonmembers, while\nfor stars 406, 528, and 536 the fibers were not well centered on the stars and velocities could not be measured.\nStar 28 appears to be a rapidly rotating early type star,\nfor which no radial velocity could be calculated using\nthe twilight sky or HD 212943 templates. We tentatively\nidentify stars 10, 185 and 534 as spectroscopic binaries,\nas the standard deviations of their velocities calculated\nfrom multiple epochs were \u223c2-3 km s\u22121 , much larger\nthan the \u223c0.4 km s\u22121 shown by the other stars.\n4.2.4. NGC 1817\n\nAs the target stars in NGC 1817 were relatively bright,\nwe were able to obtain data using two different Hydra\nfield configurations, resulting in radial velocity determination for over seventy stars. Only four stars were common to the two configurations, which were observed two\nyears apart. The radial velocities determined from the\ndifferent epochs for three of the four stars differed between 0.2 and 0.6 km s\u22121 , and for the fourth star (185)\nby 11.4 km s\u22121 . Although this latter star could be a binary, its 2006 epoch spectrum had S/N\u223c3; therefore, we\nfavor the velocity determined from the 2008 epoch spectrum, which indicates it is a cluster member (Table 3).\nThe velocity histogram for all the stars observed exhibits\na narrow peak at \u223c66 km s\u22121 .

Each histogram\nbin size is 1 km s\u22121 .\n\nities between 62 and 68 km s\u22121 , we have found a mean\nradial velocity of +65.2\u00b11.0 km s\u22121 for NGC 1817.\nWe were not able to determine velocities for two stars,\n285 and 1474. The former is an early-type star, while the\nspectrum of the latter was too noisy to determine a velocity. Mermilliod et al. (2003) determined high-precision\nradial velocities for several red giants in the field of NGC\n1817; their cluster average velocity +65.33\u00b10.52 (standard error; 29 stars) km s\u22121 is in excellent agreement\nwith our value. Of the 17 stars common to our two\nsamples, three are identified as binary systems: 1420,\n1424 and 1467. The latter two stars are non-members\naccording to their radial velocities and are identified as\nbinaries based on the differences between our values and\nMermilliod et al. (2003) being \u221229.2 and +4.2 km s\u22121 ,\nrespectively. Considering only the fourteen stars identified as single star systems common to our samples, the\naverage difference between our determined radial velocities is \u22120.05\u00b10.24 (s.d.) km s\u22121 , with our values being\nsmaller. Lastly, we note that star 1502, which has a velocity \u223c5 km s\u22121 from the cluster mean, is identified by\nMermilliod et al. (2003) as a nonmember based on its 0%\nmembership probability assigned by Balaguer-N\u00fa\u00f1ez et\nal. (1998). Balaguer-N\u00fa\u00f1ez et al. (2004a) redetermined\nthe proper motion probability for this star (among others) using both parametric and non-parametric methods\nand found membership probabilities of 65% or 48%, identifying it as a probable non-member. We have listed it\nas a possible member, based on its radial velocity. Based\n\non KPNO 4m echelle spectra, Jacobson et al. (2009) determined velocities of +65.9 and +66.1 km s\u22121 for stars\n73 and 79, respectively. These values are in good agreement with the results presented here: +65.1 and +65.8\nkm s\u22121 .\n4.2.5. NGC 2158\n\nNGC 2158 is an important, rich, old cluster, but its\nlocation in a rich stellar field makes determination of\ncluster members in photometric studies difficult. Relatively few radial velocity studies exist for this cluster,\nmost of which are based on low-resolution spectroscopy.\nWe have determined radial velocities for 36 stars in the\ncluster field from WIYN-Hydra data. In addition to the\nthree epochs of observations centered at \u223c\u03bb6280 \u00c5, observations centered at \u03bb6600 \u00c5 were obtained in 2006\nFebruary. Radial velocities were measured using a twilight sky spectrum as a template, and then were shifted\nto the same scale as the 2008 December measures based\non 12 stars common to each field configuration. (The average difference in radial velocity between the two epochs\nof observation was +3.9\u00b10.5 km s\u22121 (s.d.).) Radial velocities based on the 2006 Feb spectra are given in Table 1\nfor eight stars.\nThe histogram of radial velocities for NGC 2158 stars\npresents a fairly broad peak around +27 km s\u22121 . From\n27 stars, we have calculated an average radial velocity\nof +26.9\u00b11.9 (s.d.) km s\u22121 for the cluster. Two more\nstars with velocities within 15 km s\u22121 are identified as\n\n\f8\n\nJacobson, Pilachowski & Friel\n\npossible members. Our average value for the cluster is\nin good agreement with that of Friel et al. (2002), who\nfound +28\u00b110 km s\u22121 from moderate-resolution spectra of seven stars. Minniti (1995) found a much lower\nmean velocity based on 20 stars: +14\u00b19 km s\u22121 , although with a possible 10 km s\u22121 uncertainty in the zero\npoint. Geisler (1988) determined velocities for two stars\nfrom medium-resolution spectra, of which only 4230 is\ncommon to our study. His value of +9.8 km s\u22121 for this\nstar is much lower than the value we found here (+25.3\nkm s\u22121 ) as well as the value determined from KPNO 4m\nechelle spectra of this star (Jacobson et al. 2009; +24.3\nkm s\u22121 ). There is no indication in our data that star 4230\nis a binary, although more epochs of observations would\nbe needed to confirm this. In the meantime, our radial\nvelocity measurements indicate it is a cluster member.\nWe have identified stars 4305 and 5102 as likely binary\nsystems.\n4.2.6. NGC 2194\n\nNGC 2194 has the appearance of a rich cluster, though\nit is located in a crowded field (Piatti et al. 2003). A\nCMD of the cluster shows relatively few evolved stars to\ntarget for observation. Of the 20 or so stars observed in\nthe field, seven cluster around 7-8 km s\u22121 in the velocity histogram (Figure 2). These are taken to be cluster\nmembers, yielding an average velocity of +7.5\u00b10.8 (s.d.)\nkm s\u22121 . Four more stars with velocities within 15 km s\u22121\nof this value are taken to be possible cluster members.\nNo velocity variations were detected for any stars over\nthe six day period in which the data were taken. The\nlow value of this cluster's radial velocity meant that the\ntelluric emission line at \u03bb6300 \u00c5 was exactly superposed\nonto the [O I] forbidden feature in the stellar spectra, and\na clean removal of the sky line was not possible. Therefore, no oxygen abundances for stars in this cluster were\ndetermined.\n\ntant field star with similar radial velocity. Comparison\nof this star's chemical abundances to those of the red\nclump stars may shed light on this issue. Soubiran et al.\nalso noted that the FWHM of its cross correlation function was larger than typical for other cluster members,\npossibly indicating binarity or fast rotation. The radial\nvelocities we determined for this star based on spectra\nfrom two different epochs did not show any variation, nor\ndid Mermilliod et al. (2008) detect velocity variations in\ntheir observations. Likewise, the FWHM of individual\nabsorption lines in its spectrum are comparable to those\nof other members of NGC 2355.\n4.2.8. NGC 2420\n\nOf 22 stars observed in the field of NGC 2420, twelve\noccupied a narrow peak in the velocity histogram. The\naverage radial velocity based on these twelve stars is\n+73.6\u00b10.6 km s\u22121 . One star, 8010, is a possible cluster member, as its velocity is within 15 km s\u22121 of the\ncluster mean. All other stars in the field are clearly nonmembers. Our measured radial velocity for the cluster\nis in good agreement with that of Mermilliod & Mayor\n(2007), who found +73.18\u00b10.94 from 14 single cluster\nmembers. For the 13 stars common to our two studies,\nthe average difference between our measures is smaller\nthan 1 km s\u22121 . Pancino et al. (2010) determined radial\nvelocities of three cluster members from high resolution\nechelle spectra. The average velocity of these three stars\nis +74.5\u00b10.9 km s\u22121 . Star 174 is a known spectroscopic\nbinary (e.g., Smith & Suntzeff 1987), while Mermilliod\n& Mayor (2007) identified stars 76, 111 and 174 as possible binaries based on differences between their velocities\nand literature values. Our measures for these stars agree\nwith those of Mermilliod & Mayor (2007) to better than\n0.6 km s\u22121 , though we note that both our values for star\n76 differ from that of Pancino et al. (2010) by more than\n1 km s\u22121 . These stars are identified as possible binaries\nin Table 1.\n\n4.2.7. NGC 2355\n\nOnly a dozen stars in the field of NGC 2355 were targeted for observation. Fortunately, a clear cluster locus\nwas readily identified in the radial velocity histogram.\nBased on six stars identified as members, we have found\nan average radial velocity of +35.4\u00b10.5 km s\u22121 for NGC\n2355. This value is in excellent agreement with those\nfound by Soubiran et al. (2000; +35.13\u00b10.39 km s\u22121\nfrom 9 stars) and Mermilliod et al. (2008; +35.02\u00b10.42\nkm s\u22121 from 7 stars). Our measures for individual stars\nare also in general excellent agreement with these two\nstudies, save for star 548. Soubiran et al. (2000) identified it as a nonmember based on a radial velocity of\n\u221232.43 km s\u22121 , however, both we and Mermilliod et al.\n(2008) found it to have a radial velocity consistent with\nthe cluster mean. Apart from this star, average differences between our values and those of Soubiran et al. and\nMermilliod et al. for stars in common are 0.4 km s\u22121 or\nsmaller.\nSoubiran et al. (2000) remarked on the curious nature\nof star 398, a cluster member two magnitudes brighter\nthan the red clump, with the same color as red clump\nstars. We confirm its velocity is consistent with that of\nthe cluster (as does Mermilliod et al. 2008), although\nas Soubiran et al. pointed out, it could be a less dis-\n\n4.2.9. NGC 2425\n\nAs can be seen in the bottom panel of Figure 2, stars\nin the field of NGC 2425 have relatively large radial velocities: ten stars clump in the histogram at an average\nvelocity of +102.9\u00b11.2 km s\u22121 , which we adopt as the\ncluster mean. Four other stars with velocities within 15\nkm s\u22121 of this value are identified as possible cluster\nmembers. Star 815 is a binary star, as its radial velocity varied across all three epochs of observations, with\nits 2007 November spectra showing a velocity consistent\nwith the cluster mean.\n4.2.10. NGC 7789\n\nThe radial velocity histogram for NGC 7789 is strongly\npeaked at \u221254 km s\u22121 but is also broader compared to\nother open clusters, with several stars having velocities\nwithin 2 km s\u22121 of this value. A similar broad distribution can also be seen in the radial velocity study of\nGim et al. (1998a). They calculated radial velocities for\n112 stars in the field of NGC 7789 and found a binary\nfraction of 32%, which can explain the broad distribution in the radial velocity histogram. Based on 50 single\nstar members, Gim et al. determined an average radial\nvelocity of \u221254.9\u00b10.86 (s.d.) km s\u22121 . As we used their\n\n\fAbundances in Rgc \u223c9-13 kpc Open Clusters\nmeasurements for our target selection, it is encouraging\nthat all but one observed star are at least possible cluster\nmembers. Comparison of our radial velocities to those of\nGim et al. finds very good agreement, with the average\ndifference between our values (excluding binary systems)\nbeing 0.1\u00b10.7 km s\u22121 with our values larger. The average radial velocity for NGC 7789 determined from our\ntargets (26 single stars) is \u221254.7\u00b11.3 km s\u22121 (s.d.). Gim\net al. (1998a) identified several binary systems in the\ncluster, these are indicated in Table 1. They remarked\non the unknown membership status of several stars in\nthe field based on large differences between their measured velocities and the cluster mean despite their having\nproper motions consistent with membership (McNamara\n& Solomon 1981). Of these uncertain stars, 9728 is most\nsurely a binary, based on the 26.6 km s\u22121 difference between our measures and that of Gim et al. As our two\nmeasures of this star bracket the cluster mean velocity,\nwe identify it as a possible cluster member. The membership of star 7840 is also uncertain; our measure of its\nvelocity agrees within 1 km s\u22121 with that of Gim et al.,\nand with a velocity \u223c5 km s\u22121 within the cluster mean,\nwe identify it as a possible cluster member. Nine stars in\nour sample were not targeted by Gim et al. Five have velocities within 1 standard deviation of the mean and are\nidentified as members; the remaining four have velocities\nwithin 15 km s\u22121 of the cluster mean and are taken as\npossible members. Pancino et al. (2010) presented radial\nvelocities for three stars in NGC 7789, only one of which\n(7840) is common to our study. Our velocity for this\nstar agrees with that of Pancino et al. within 1 km s\u22121 .\nThe average velocity of all three stars in their sample is\n\u221251.2\u00b12.2 km s\u22121 , in good agreement with our value.\n4.3. Line list and Equivalenth Width Measurements\nAlthough the development of our line list and comparison of it to others in the literature have been described\nin our previous work (particularly Friel et al. 2003, 2010\nand Jacobson et al. 2008), it is worthwhile to include\na brief review here. Our line list is composed of absorption lines selected to be mostly free of blending in\ncool red giant star spectra at echelle resolutions. These\nlines were selected from various sources that included\nboth laboratory and inverse-solar log gf's (see Friel et al.\n2003 for details). Rather than assemble a line list with\nheterogeneous gf-values, we opted to calculate gf-values\ndifferentially relative to the mildly metal-poor red giant\nArcturus, a star more similar to those in our study than\nis the Sun. Equivalent widths were measured in the Hinkle et al. (2000) Arcturus atlas, and the log gf values\nwere altered until each line in our list reproduced the\nelement abundances of Arcturus as found by Fulbright\net al. (2006, 2007) and Peterson et al. (1993). Specifically, we reproduced the [X/H] values for Arcturus found\nby Fulbright et al. and used them along with the solar\nabundances of Anders & Grevesse (1989) to calculate log\nN(X) values for Arcturus. For the elements not analyzed\nby Fulbright et al., we used the [X/Fe] ratios found by\nPeterson et al. (1993) to determine log N(X) values.\nUncertainties and/or systematics in our log gf values therefore arise from errors in the equivalent width\nmeasurements and our choice of Arcturus element abundances. To estimate the former, we measured lines in our\n\n9\n\nTable 4\nEquivalent Width Measurements\nCluster\nM67\nM67\nM67\nM67\nM67\nM67\nM67\nM67\n\nStar\n84\n84\n84\n84\n84\n84\n84\n84\n\n\u03bb\n\nEl.\n\nE.

The average change in log gf was 0.03 dex for Fe I,\n0.02 dex for Fe II, and no more than 0.05 dex for other\nelements. Such uncertainties have a much smaller impact on abundance uncertainties than do other parameters, such as effective temperature (see next section). We\nhave made careful comparisons of our abundance scale to\nthose of others in the literature, not only based on comparison of log gf values but of abundance results for stars\nstudied in common. We refer the interested reader to discussions in Jacobson et al. (2008) and Friel et al. (2010)\nfor more details. Where necessary, we identify known or\nsuspected systematic differences between our scale and\nothers in later sections of this paper.\nEquivalent widths (EWs) of absorption lines were measured in the spectra of all cluster single star radial velocity members with S/N ratios higher than \u223c70. In some\ncases, spectra with S/N\u223c60 were analyzed, but these\nmeasurements are more uncertain, especially given that\nmany of the features are much more blended in these\nR\u223c18\u201321K spectra. All EWs were fitted with Gaussians\nusing interactive routines in IRAF's splot task, with great\ncare taken to deblend features. A few lines in our line\nlist were deemed too blended for accurate measurement;\nthese lines were discarded. Some lines, particularly of\nMg and Ti, were blended with telluric absorption features near \u03bb6300 \u00c5, depending on a star's radial velocity. In such cases, these lines were also discarded. To\naid in continuum placement, the high-resolution spectrum of Arcturus (Hinkle et al. 2000) and occasionally\nKPNO 4m (R\u223c28K) echelle spectra of cool red giants\nwere consulted. The Mg \u03bb6318 \u00c5 line is affected by a Ca\nautoionization feature. This line was measured, treating\nthe Ca autoionization feature as the continuum.\nAll EWs were measured multiple (\u223c3) times to assess\nthe uncertainties in continuum placement and fitting of\nblended features. Measurement uncertainties naturally\ndepended upon the quality of the spectra: for good S/N\n(70 or higher) spectra, measurement uncertainties were\ntypically 2\u20135 m\u00c5, but were 5\u20138 m\u00c5 for poorer-quality\nspectra. For some of the more blended, strong features,\nEW uncertainties could be as high as 10\u201315 m\u00c5, due\nto both blending and difficulty in identifying local continua. Fortunately, these instances were mainly confined\nto one or two strong Fe I lines, and so the effect on the\nabundance analysis of their large measurement error was\nmitigated by the presence of several other more reliably-\n\n\f10\n\nJacobson, Pilachowski & Friel\n\nFor most cases, our effective temperatures differ from\nspectroscopically-determined values in the literature by\nno more than 100 K, while log g's typically agree within\n0.2 dex, though occasionally within 0.4 dex.

As for our analysis of clusters NGC 2204 and\nNGC 2243 (Jacobson et al. 2011), we adopted an uncertainty 0.2 km s\u22121 for microturbulent velocity. Table 1\nshows the sensitivities of element abundances to uncertainties in the atmospheric parameters for a hotter and\ncooler star in our sample. Fortunately, changes of 0.2 dex\nin gravity have little effect on most element abundances,\nsave oxygen (see Section 4.5).\n4.4.2. Comparison to Literature Results\n\nIn general our atmospheric parameters agree well\nwith literature values for clusters previously studied, particularly high resolution spectroscopic studies.\n\n4.4.3. Microturbulent Velocity\n\nIt is well known that stellar microturblent velocity\ncan vary greatly with position in the HR diagram, with\nmore evolved stars having higher values (\u223c2\u20133 km s\u22121 ),\nand unevolved stars having lower values (.1 km s\u22121 ).\nThough all stars in this study are evolved stars, they\nvary widely in evolutionary state, as indicated by the\nnearly 2 dex range of surface gravities seen in Table 1.\nAssignment of a single microturbulent velocity across the\nboard can therefore introduce a systematic error to the\nresulting abundances for individual stars on the order of\nthe values seen in Table 1, or even larger.\nSeveral relations between vt and log g and/or Teff exist in the literature, and many studies use these relations\nto determine microturblent velocities for their program\nstars (and then often go on to modify them to remove any\nabundance trends with line strength). However, it is difficult to select a particular relation to use, because each\nis derived for stars of a particular range of temperature,\nsurface gravity and/or metallicity. Furthermore, some\nrelations are determined empirically from measured EWs\nfor a sample of stars (e.g., Gratton et al. 1996), while\nothers (e.g., Carretta et al. 2004) are determined using\ntheoretical EWs to remove what Pancino et al.

We\ncan, however, investigate the effect the adoption of a single microturbulent velocity has on our abundance results\nby selecting a few relations from the literature, calculating new abundances, and comparing them to our results.\nWe selected five relations from the literature: vt =\n1.5 \u2212 0.13 log g (Carretta et al. 2004; C04); vt = 4.08\n\u2212 5.01\u00d710\u22124 Teff (Ram\u0131\u0301rez & Cohen 2003; RC); vt =\n\u22120.254 log g + 1.930 (Marino et al. 2008; M08); vt =\n2.22 \u2212 0.322 log g (Gratton et al. 1996; G96); and vt =\n\u22120.0011 Teff + 6.66 (Johnson et al. 2008; J08). While\nall these relations are appropriate for red giant stars, the\nmajority of them were determined based on metal-poor\nstars: the RC, M08 and J08 relations were determined\nfor globular cluster stars, while the metallicity range of\nthe bulk of stars used in the G96 relation is [Fe/H]\u223c \u22121.0\nto 0.0. Only the C04 relation is based on open cluster\nstars.\nWe used these relations to calculate microturbulent velocities for stars in the clusters M 67, NGC 1817, NGC\n2420 and NGC 7789. These clusters were selected for\n\nthis analysis because either their element abundances are\nvery well known (M 67), they have a sample of stars\nranging 1.8 dex in log g (NGC 7789), they are relatively\nmetal-poor (NGC 2420), or conversely to NGC 7789, the\nsample of stars analyzed have log g \u223c2.0\u20133.0, for which vt\n= 1.5 km s\u22121 may be systematically incorrect for all stars\n(NGC 1817). The values for individual stars ranged as\nmuch as 0.5 km s\u22121 from all the different relations used.\nIn general, the C04 relation resulted in the lowest microturbulent velocities (median values 1.1\u20131.2 km s\u22121 ),\nand the M08 (1.2-1.3 km s\u22121 ), G96 (1.4 km s\u22121 ) and RC\n(1.5\u20131.7 km s\u22121 ) relations in successively larger values\nfor all four clusters considered. Median microturbulent\nvalues from the J08 relation varied from 1.1 km s\u22121 for\nNGC 1817 to 1.5 km s\u22121 for M 67. As mentioned by\nPancino et al. (2010), the systematically low vt values\nfrom the C04 relation are likely due to the relation being\nbased on theoretical EWs, rather than measured EWs.\nTo illustrate the effect of the adopted microturbulent\nvelocity on resulting abundances, we highlight only three\nrelations: C04 and G96 because they are often used by\nother studies in the literature (e.g., Sestito et al. 2008),\nand J08. This latter relation was determined from a\nsample of 180 giant stars in \u03c9 Cen observed with the\nHydra multi-object spectrograph on the CTIO 4m telescope, most similar to the data analyzed here (though\nnote that the log g range of \u03c9 Cen giants is smaller than\nconsidered here: \u223c0.4 to 1.5, and its [Fe/H] range of\n\u22122.2 to \u22120.7 is also lower). We determined abundances\nfor stars in all four clusters using our determined temperatures and gravities and the microturbulent velocities\nfrom these three relations and then calculated weighted\nmean cluster abundances and standard deviations, as described in the next section. Table 1 shows the differences\nbetween weighted mean cluster abundances (log N(X))\nwhen 1.5 km s\u22121 is assigned to all stars and when microturbulent velocities are determined by the above relations.\nAs can be seen, the differences in log N(X) abundances\nfor non-Fe elements are generally less than 0.1 dex, save\nfor Ca. Not surprisingly, the effect on Fe abundances\ncan be large. Regarding the abundances of individual\nstars, we found that the line-by-line dispersion in Fe\nabundance is independent of the adopted microturbulent velocity. Likewise, the standard deviation of cluster\nweighted mean abundances is independent of adopted\nmicroturbulent velocities, which implies that the choice\nof microturbulent velocity does not impact clusters with\n\n\f12\n\nJacobson, Pilachowski & Friel\nTable 7\nAbundance Differences for Different Microturbulent Velocities\nM 67\n\nEl.\nFe I\nNa\nMg\nAl\nSi\nCa\nTi\nNi\nZr\n\nNGC 1817\n\nNGC 2420\n\nNGC 7789\n\nG96\n\nC04\n\nJ08\n\nG96\n\nC04\n\nJ08\n\nG96\n\nC04\n\nJ08\n\nG96\n\nC04\n\nJ08\n\n\u22120.05\n\u22120.01\n\u22120.02\n\u22120.05\n\u22120.02\n\u22120.05\n\u22120.02\n\u22120.03\n+0.00\n\n\u22120.16\n\u22120.05\n\u22120.05\n\u22120.10\n\u22120.04\n\u22120.16\n\u22120.08\n\u22120.12\n\u22120.14\n\n\u22120.01\n+0.01\n+0.00\n+0.01\n+0.01\n+0.00\n+0.01\n+0.01\n\u22120.09\n\n\u22120.07\n\u22120.02\n\u22120.01\n***\n\u22120.04\n\u22120.08\n\u22120.01\n\u22120.03\n\u22120.08\n\n\u22120.18\n\u22120.05\n\u22120.03\n***\n\u22120.07\n\u22120.15\n\u22120.02\n\u22120.06\n\u22120.09\n\n\u22120.15\n\u22120.04\n\u22120.03\n***\n\u22120.04\n\u22120.16\n\u22120.02\n\u22120.05\n\u22120.09\n\n\u22120.03\n\u22120.01\n\u22120.01\n***\n\u22120.01\n\u22120.05\n+0.00\n\u22120.02\n+0.00\n\n\u22120.16\n\u22120.01\n\u22120.02\n***\n\u22120.04\n\u22120.15\n\u22120.03\n\u22120.08\n\u22120.01\n\n\u22120.10\n\u22120.03\n\u22120.01\n***\n\u22120.03\n\u22120.11\n\u22120.02\n\u22120.05\n+0.00\n\n\u22120.05\n\u22120.02\n\u22120.02\n***\n\u22120.06\n\u22120.05\n+0.03\n\u22120.01\n+0.10\n\n\u22120.20\n+0.00\n\u22120.06\n***\n\u22120.12\n\u22120.18\n\u22120.09\n\u22120.03\n\u22120.09\n\n\u22120.03\n\u22120.05\n\u22120.01\n***\n\u22120.05\n\u22120.01\n+0.02\n+0.02\n+0.13\n\nNote. - Shown here are differences between log N(X) abundances calculated adopting vt = 1.5 km s\u22121 for each star and abundances calculated\nusing the vt relations from G96, C04 and J08.

The smallest\nabundance differences occur for the G96 relation, which\nof all the relations produces median velocities near 1.5\nkm s\u22121 .\nAlthough Table 1 shows that cluster weighted mean\nabundances are impacted by the adoption of a single mictroturbulent velocity for all stars, the magnitude of the\neffect appears comparable to that seen when comparing\nabundances determined using velocities from different relations in the literature. Furthermore, the majority of\nhigh resolution spectroscopic studies in the literature refine microturbulent velocities in the abundance analysis,\nand as already mentioned, the final adopted velocities\noften fall within 1.3\u20131.7 km s\u22121 for the studies we often compare our results to (see, e.g., Yong et al. 2005,\n\nPancino et al. 2010). Comparisons of abundance results\nin our previous work to the literature for clusters such\nas M 67 have shown general good agreement in spite of\nour adoption of vt = 1.5 km s\u22121 for the majority of our\nprogram stars. Therefore, we conclude that no major\nsystematics are introduced into our results as a result\nof our treatment of microturbulence. It is important to\nnote, though, that the adoption of different relations by\ndifferent studies may introduce systematic differences between studies: a 0.4 km s\u22121 difference in vt corresponds\nto \u223c0.18-0.20 dex difference in [Fe/H], as shown here.\nHowever, given that the spectroscopic determination of\nTeff and vt are linked, this effect may be at least partly\ncompensated for by choice of effective temperature.\n\n\fAbundances in Rgc \u223c9-13 kpc Open Clusters\n4.5. Abundance Analysis\nElement abundances were determined using the 2002\nversion of the LTE analysis code MOOG (Sneden 1973).\nModel atmospheres were interpolated from a grid of\nplane parallel MARCS models (Bell et al. 1976) with appropriate effective temperatures and surface gravities for\nthe majority of program stars (exceptions noted below).\nInitial values of [M/H] were chosen based on previous estimations of cluster metallicity in the literature. [M/H]\nvalues were then altered depending on the Fe abundance\ndetermined in the first iteration. The metallicity stepsize of our atmosphere grid is 0.25 dex. Only Fe I lines\nwith equivalent widths 150 m\u00c5 or smaller were used to\ncalculate stellar metallicity; given the smaller number of\nlines available for non-Fe elements, all lines were used to\ndetermine abundances regardless of strength. Such cases\nwhere strong line abundances were used are noted in the\ntables.\nSeveral stars in NGC 188 have log g values greater\nthan 3.0, beyond the extent of our grid of plane parallel\nMARCS models. Rather than extrapolate to gravities as\nhigh as 3.7, we opted to use a grid of the newer spherical MARCS models7 (Gustafsson et al. 2008). We compared the plane parallel and spherical models to be sure\nthere were no gross differences, and we also compared\nthe abundances determined for sample stars (with log g\n< 3.0) using both models. For all elements, the abundance differences amounted to no more than 0.03 dex, so\nwe are confident that no major systematic uncertainties\nare introduced by the adoption of the spherical MARCS\nmodels for a subset of our stars.\nIndividual star iron abundances based on Fe I and Fe\nII lines are given in Table 1, in the form log N(Fe), along\nwith standard deviations of the mean and the number\nof lines measured. Also listed are [Fe/H] ratios calculated from the Fe I abundances only, which we adopt as\nthe stellar metallicities, relative to a solar log N(Fe) =\n7.52, the default used in MOOG. Table 1 presents stellar abundances of Mg, Si, Ca and Ti in the form log\nN(X), along with standard deviations of the mean and\nthe number of lines used to calculate the averages. Table 1 presents abundances of Na, Ni and Zr in the same\nformat. Tables 1 and 1 present abundance ratios [X/H]\nand [X/Fe] for the \u03b1 elements and Na, Ni and Zr, respectively, along with standard deviations for [X/Fe]. [X/Fe]\nratios are calculated using each individual star's [Fe/H]\nvalue, and \u03c3 [X/F e] is calculated by adding the standard\ndeviations of [X/H] and [Fe/H] in quadrature. Stellar\n[X/H] and [X/Fe] ratios are all calculated relative to the\nsolar abundances of Anders & Grevesse (1989), the default solar abundances used in MOOG.\nAs in our previous analysis of single-order Hydra\nechelle spectra (Jacobson et al. 2011), we have chosen\nto calculate weighted cluster mean abundances (Taylor\n1982) in order to minimize the contribution of individual\nstar abundances with relatively large uncertainties. Individual stellar abundances are weighted by their standard\ndeviations in the calculation of the cluster average. For\nthe majority of elements, the difference between weighted\nand unweighted cluster means is generally within 0.05\ndex, save for elements such as Zr, the lines of which are of7\n\nSee http://marcs.astro.uu.se/\n\n13\n\nten very weak or not measured in some stars. The cluster\nexhibiting the largest difference between weighted and\nunweighted mean abundances is NGC 2355, for which element abundances vary rather largely (\u223c0.3 dex) among\nits five stars. Weighted cluster mean [X/H] ratios along\nwith standard deviations and the number of stars used,\nare presented in Table 1, while Table 1 presents the same\nfor [X/Fe].\nWe stress that the magnesium abundances are based\non measurement of the \u03bb6318 \u00c5 feature only. This feature is greatly blended at this spectral resolution, and\ntherefore the resulting Mg abundances are very uncertain and likely overestimates. To calculate \u03c3 [Mg/F e] for\neach star, we assigned an uncertainty of 0.2 dex to its\n[Mg/H] ratio. Likewise, we adopted 0.2 dex uncertainty\nfor Zr abundances based on measurement of only a single\nline. This is approximately the line-by-line dispersion in\nFe abundance for individual stars. Examination of the\nSi abundances showed that the \u03bb6243 \u00c5 line produced\nsystematically larger abundances for nearly every star\nin our sample. Given that this line is quite blended in\nthese Hydra data, we excluded it from calculation of stellar Si abundances. The Na abundances presented here\nare LTE abundances; we make no corrections for NLTE\neffects. Given that most of our sample stars are relatively\nmetal-rich and warm, and that we use the \u03bb\u03bb6154-6160\n\u00c5 Na doublet, the NLTE corrections are not expected to\nbe large (Mashonkina et al. 2000).\nAbundances of Al and Cr were also determined for all\nM 67 stars and three NGC 2158 stars from Hydra \u03bb\u223c6600\n\u00c5 spectra. These abundances are shown in Table 1. To\nestimate the uncertainties in [Cr/Fe], which rests on the\nmeasurement of only one line, we assigned an uncertainty\nof 0.2 dex to log N(Cr). Similarly, we assigned 0.2 dex\nuncertainty to the Si, Ti and Ni log N(X) values of NGC\n2158 stars 7773 and 7866, since they are also determined\nfrom a single line only. Given that non-Fe element abundances for these two stars are based on only one line, they\nare excluded from the calculation of the cluster average\nabundances shown in Tables 1 and 1. The average [Fe/H]\nfor NGC 2158 changes only by 0.01 dex with no change\nin standard deviation if these stars are included in the\ncalculation, therefore their exclusion does not affect the\ncluster's mean metallicity measurement. Weighted cluster mean Al and Cr abundance ratios for M 67 and NGC\n2158 are given in Table 1.\n4.6. Spectrum Synthesis of [O I] \u03bb6300 \u00c5\n\nAs in all our previous work, oxygen abundances were\ndetermined via spectrum synthesis of the [O I] \u03bb6300.3\n\u00c5 feature. The spectra of stars in clusters NGC 188,\nNGC 1245, NGC 1817, NGC 2425 and NGC 7789 required correction for telluric contamination, and no oxygen abundances were determined for stars in NGC 2194.\nReaders are referred to, e.g., Jacobson et al.

Three\nsynthetic spectra were generated at a time, typically in\n0.1\u20130.25 dex steps in oxygen abundance, and the best\nfit spectrum was determined by eye (see Figure 3). The\nuncertainty of this fit was then found by decreasing the\nstep size in abundance until no single best fit abundance\ncould be identified. This uncertainty was typically \u223c0.07\ndex. Table 1 shows the log N(O), fitting uncertainty,\n[X/H] and [O/Fe] value for each star analyzed, relative\nto log N\u2299 (O) = 8.93 set as the default in MOOG (Anders & Grevesse 1989). Note that oxygen abundances\nwere not determined for all stars in each cluster. In general, stars were excluded when the telluric emission line\nnear the oxygen feature had not been cleanly removed in\nthe data reduction process and the quality of the fit was\njudged too poor to determine a reliable oxygen abundance. Cluster average [O/H] and [O/Fe] ratios along\nwith standard deviations and the number of stars per\ncluster are shown in Table 1.\nOverall uncertainties in the oxygen abundances can\nbe attributed to uncertainties in atmospheric parameters, uncertainties in the fit of the syntheses as described\nabove, uncertainties in the smoothing of the synthetic\nspectra, and uncertainties due to lack of any abundance\ninformation for carbon and nitrogen. As before, we have\nadopted [C/Fe] and [N/Fe] ratios for each star according to its [Fe/H] value, based on Figures 4 and 5 in\nTautvai\u0161ien\u0117 et al. (2010). Typically, these were [C/Fe]\n= \u22120.20, [N/Fe] = +0.30. Table 1 shows uncertainties\nin oxygen abundance for a hotter (NGC 1817 164) and\ncooler (NGC 188 6712) star in our sample. As can be\nseen, the uncertainties are generally smaller than the fitting uncertainties for most stars. It is well-known that\n\nthe [O I] \u03bb 6300.3 \u00c5 feature is blended with a nickel\nline. This line was included in the synthesis line list, and\nfit with the Ni abundance found for each star from the\nequivalent width analysis, as already mentioned. The\nadopted log gf value of this Ni feature could impact the\nresulting oxygen abundance, especially as the value used\nhere (\u22123.0) is smaller than that found by Johansson et\nal. (2003; \u22122.11). To test this, we performed a spectrum synthesis using the Johansson et al. log gf value and\nfound the oxygen abundance was unchanged. Therefore,\nthe presence of this feature should have negligible effect\non the determined oxygen abundance.\n5. COMPARISON TO PREVIOUS RESULTS\n\nWe offer in Appendix B a brief comparison of our abundance results to those of previous studies for each individual cluster. Here, we confine the discussion to the comparison of the results for four clusters which we have analyzed previously, based on R\u223c28 000 KPNO 4m echelle\nspectra: M 67, NGC 188 (Friel et al. 2010), NGC 1817\nand NGC 2158 (Jacobson et al. 2009). It is worthwhile\nto briefly compare the results from the WIYN Hydra\nspectra to this earlier work, since, although the Hydra\ndata are lower resolution, single-order spectra, the number of stars analyzed per cluster should make the Hydra\nresults much more statistically robust. What is more,\nwe have made a careful comparison of results found from\nKPNO 4m and WIYN Hydra echelle spectra for stars in\nthe cluster NGC 7142 (Jacobson et al. 2008), and found\nthem to be consistent within the (larger) uncertainties of\nthe Hydra spectra.\nIn general, the abundances found from the Hydra spectra are slightly lower than those found from the 4m spectra. Abundances of elements for clusters M 67, NGC 188\nand NGC 1817 generally agree within \u223c0.12 dex, which\n\n\fAbundances in Rgc \u223c9-13 kpc Open Clusters\n\n15\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\nC 8.08, N 8.12, O 8.40\nC 8.08, N 8.12, O 8.60\nC 8.08, N 8.12, O 8.80\n\nNGC 2420 111\n[Fe/H] = -0.28\n0.4\n6298\n\n6300\n\n6302\n\nFigure 3.

The\nHydra abundances of Mg and Al for M 67 are 0.2 dex\nlarger than those determined from the KPNO 4m spectra. That said, agreement is much poorer for NGC 2158:\nthe [Fe/H] = \u22120.28 found here is much lower than that\nfound in our previous work (\u22120.03), which was based on\nan analysis of one star only (Jacobson et al. 2009). In\naddition to iron, abundances of Na, Ca, Ti and Zr also\ndiffer by 0.20 dex or more.\nThe differences arise from the choice of temperature\nscale, which is dependent upon the choice of E(B\u2212V) towards the cluster. One can see this in the abundances\ndetermined for the star for which we have both KPNO\n4m and WIYN Hydra spectra, star 4230. The Teff value\nwe determined from the KPNO 4m spectrum based on\nexcitation equilibrium was 4400 K, which is consistent\nwith a photometric temperature found with the adoption of E(B\u2212V) = 0.55 and (m\u2212M)0 = 13.0, roughly the\nmedian values found in the literature for NGC 2158 (see\nAppendix A). These values were used to determine atmospheric parameters in the preliminary analysis of the\nHydra spectra mentioned in Jacobson et al. (2009). Using this temperature scale, which is on average 200 K\nhotter than that adopted here (using E(B\u2212V) = 0.43,\n(m\u2212M)0 = 13.0), NGC 2158's mean metallicity becomes\n[Fe/H] = \u22120.12\u00b10.10 (s.d.), and all element abundances\nfound for star 4230 agree with that determined from the\nKPNO 4m spectrum to within 0.07 dex.\nThe difficulties in determining the fundamental parameters for this cluster have been well documented in\nthe literature: generally speaking, it is either near solar\nmetallicity and rather heavily reddened, or less reddened\nand more metal-poor. As already discussed here and in\nJacobson et al. (2009), we consider the distance and reddening determination of Grochalski & Sarajedini (2002),\nbased on the K magnitude of NGC 2158's rich red clump,\nas the most reliable, since near-infrared photometry is\nmuch less sensitive to extinction. Therefore, we consider\nthe abundance results of this analysis to be more likely\ncorrect.\nSoubiran et al.

All of these are publicly available in the\nELODIE Archive8 (Moultaka et al. 2004), but the S/N\nratios are too low for EW measurements. However, a\nS/N = 42 spectrum of star 398 was obtained in 2002\n(ELODIE archive identifier: 20021022/0024) and is available in the archive. After visual examination, the spectrum was deemed good enough for EW measurement,\ndespite its relatively low S/N ratio.\nThe ELODIE spectrum spans \u03bb4000-6800 \u00c5, so it was\npossible to measure the majority of the lines in our list,\nincluding lines for the elements Al and Cr, which are\nnot measurable in the Hydra spectra. Given the larger\nnumber of Fe I and Fe II lines available, the atmospheric\nparameters for 398 were determined spectroscopically by\nforcing excitation and ionization equilibrium, and the\nresulting parameters are in good agreement with that\nfound photometrically. The resulting Fe abundance is\nalso in decent agreement, with log N(Fe) = 7.52\u00b10.15\n(cf. 7.78\u00b10.28). Other elements agree within 0.2 dex,\nsave for Mg, which is \u223c0.3 dex larger from the Hydra\n8\n\nhttp://atlas.obs-hp.fr/elodie/intro.html\n\nspectrum. In general, star 398 has similar element abundances to the other NGC 2355 stars, confirming it is indeed a cluster member, despite its unique location in the\ncolor-magnitude diagram. However, given the large starto-star abundance dispersion, this should be confirmed\nby higher resolution spectroscopic follow-up of these and\nother cluster members. Based on analysis of this one star\nin NGC 2355, [Al/H] = [Al/Fe] = \u22120.12\u00b10.12 (s.d.) and\n[Cr/H] = [Cr/Fe] = \u22120.18\u00b10.04 (s.d.). Clearly, these\nabundances must be confirmed with the analysis of more\ncluster members.\n6. DISCUSSION\n6.1. Abundance trends with Rgc\nWith chemical abundances determined for the current\nsample, we combine these with results from our previous work (Friel et al. 2005, 2010, Jacobson et al. 2008,\n2009, 2011). Keeping in mind the four clusters common\nto our previous and current work, our total sample is\ncomprised of 19 open clusters with Rgc values between\n9 and 14 kpc, which appears to be the transition region\nbetween the inner and outer disk. All abundances have\nbeen determined in a consistent fashion using the same\nline list and methodology. Table 1 gives a summary of\nthe clusters from our previous work.\nWe note here that our previous determinations of distances to clusters in Friel et al. (2010) and Jacobson et\nal. (2009, 2011) via the red clump luminosity method\ndid not take into account interstellar reddening in the\nK-band, AK , and so consequently are systematically too\ndistant. Revised values are given in Table 1. Given the\nsmall amount of dust attenuation at near-infrared wavelengths, distances have changed only 0.1 kpc for all clusters save the more highly reddened cluster Be 17, for\nwhich the distance was decreased 0.3 kpc to Rgc =11.4\nkpc.\nIn order to explore abundance trends across the full\nextent of the disk, we have combined our work with\nthose of other groups from the literature, such as Yong et\nal. (2005), Bragaglia et al. (2001, 2008), Carretta et al.\n(2004, 2005, 2007) and Sestito et al. (2006, 2007, 2008).\nThese groups have studied clusters both in the inner and\nouter disk, and we have performed a detailed comparison\nof our results and methods to identify systematic differences (see Friel et al. 2010). In this paper, we include\nthe more recent work of Magrini et al. (2010) on three\nopen clusters inside the solar circle and of Mikolaitis et\nal. (2010) on NGC 6134. As in Jacobson et al. (2011),\nwe also include the outer disk clusters of Carraro et al.\n(2004, 2007) and Villanova et al. (2005), which we have\nplaced on our abundance scale. (Of these latter clusters,\nindicated by crosses in all figures, we consider the abundances of Be 22, Be 29 and Be 66 to be more reliable on\nour abundance scale than the clusters of Carraro et al.\n(2007), and so these are indicated by larger symbols.

Radial metallicity distribution of open clusters in the current sample (filled squares), our previous work (Friel et al. 2005,\n2010; Jacobson et al. 2008, 2009, 2011; open squares). Circles represent the sample of Yong et al. (2005) and triangles represent clusters\nof Bragaglia et al. (2001, 2008), Carretta et al. (2004, 2005, 2007), Magrini et al. (2010), Mikolaitis et al. (2010), and Sestito et al. (2006,\n2007, 2008). Clusters studied by Carraro et al. (2004, 2007) and Villanova et al. (2005), placed on our abundance scale, are shown as\ncrosses. As described in Jacobson et al. (2010), the sizes of the crosses indicate the reliability of the measurement on our abundance scale\n(see that publication for details). Error bars on the filled squares are weighted standard deviations; those on the open squares are standard\nerrors of the mean. A representative error bar for the abundance measurement of a single star in the current sample is shown to the right\nof the plot. Clusters common to different studies are connected by dotted lines.\n\nalso remind the reader that the oxygen abundances of\nCarraro et al. (2004) and Villanova et al. (2005) are not\non our abundance scale, and consequently are indicated\nby small crosses as well. See Jacobson et al. (2011) for\ndetails.) All combined, these samples comprise \u223c42 open\nclusters spanning Rgc \u223c6.5\u201323 kpc, with roughly half of\nthe sample (our work) in the transition region between\nthe inner and outer disk. With the transition region now\nmore populated and finely sampled, perhaps we can say\nsomething meaningful about the nature of the transition\nbetween the inner and outer disk.\nFigure 4 shows the cluster metallicity gradient from\nthe cluster samples listed above. In this and all subsequent figures, the error bars shown are the standard\nerrors of the mean abundance for each cluster. Note\nthat errors due to adoption of atmospheric parameters\nas discussed in Section 4.4 are not included here. Comparison of Figure 4 to the radial metallicity distribution\nof a large heterogeneous cluster sample in Pancino et al.\n(2010; their Figure 9) shows them to be similar, though\nwith our sample having smaller dispersion in [Fe/H] per\nunit Rgc . This is likely due to the (hopefully) smaller\nsystematic differences within our sample. Our previous\npapers (open squares in Figure 4) showed the transition\nto be a smooth one, with no clear signs of a sharp discontinuity such as that seen at Rgc = 10 kpc in the sample\nof Twarog et al. (1997). This is essentially unchanged\nby the inclusion of the new results presented here, yet\nwe acknowledge that Figure 4 leaves much room for interpretation. Three features of Figure 4 emphasize the\nambiguity of the distribution. First, there are the different [Fe/H] values for NGC 2158 found here (\u22120.28)\nand in Jacobson et al. (2009; \u22120.03). At Rgc =12.5 kpc,\nNGC 2158 occupies an important place in the transition\nregion, and the interpretation of the dispersion in [Fe/H]\n\nas a function of Rgc changes significantly if the results of\nthe current analysis (of a larger stellar sample) for the\ncluster is more correct. With an [Fe/H] \u223c\u22120.3, NGC\n2158 has a metallicity more consistent with outer disk\nclusters, implying that the transition from the inner disk\nto the outer disk may be closer to Rgc \u223c12 kpc instead\nof beyond \u223c14 kpc as our earlier (smaller) samples suggested.\nSecond, two other clusters in our sample with [Fe/H]\u223c0\nat Rgc \u223c12 kpc also greatly influence the appearance of\na large dispersion in metallicity in the transition region.\nWe call attention to the fact that the analysis of these two\nclusters (NGC 2141 and NGC 1883; Jacobson et al. 2009)\nrests on only 1\u20132 stars per cluster. Given their crucial\nlocation in the transition region, these results should be\nconfirmed.\nThird, the appearance of a slope in [Fe/H] interior to\nRgc = 10 kpc is driven by the handful of supersolar metallicity clusters (NGC 6253, NGC 6791, NGC 6583). One\nof these clusters, NGC 6791, has been considered an exceptional cluster for some time, considering its old age,\nextreme richness and interesting orbit (e.g., Carraro et\nal. 2006). The recent work of Magrini et al. (2010) on the\nmetallicity gradient in the inner disk showed NGC 6253\nand NGC 6583 to be more metal-rich than other clusters\nand the vast majority of Cepheids in the inner disk. Calculations of these orbits showed that, at least in the case\nof NGC 6583, cluster perigalactic and apogalactic radii\ncan differ by 3-4 kpc. Depending on the choice of the\ngalactic potential, the birth location of NGC 6253 can be\nas close to the Galactic center as Rgc \u223c5 kpc. Therefore,\nif these supersolar metallicity clusters are special cases,\nand not necessarily representative of inner disk clusters\nin general, then the metallicity distribution of clusters\ninside Rgc = 10 kpc is flat, with a mean [Fe/H] close to\n\n\f18\n\nJacobson, Pilachowski & Friel\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n\nFigure 5. The radial distribution of open cluster \u03b1 element abundances. Symbols same as in Figure 4.\n\nsolar. That said, one could argue that, supersolar metallicity clusters aside, there is a smooth decrease in [Fe/H]\nwith Rgc between Rgc = 7 kpc and 13 kpc, albeit with\nincreasing dispersion at larger Rgc .\nThe radial dependence of element [X/Fe] ratios are\nshown in Figures 5 and 6. One is struck by the range\nin [X/Fe] found by different studies for the same cluster:\nvariations can be as large as 0.3 dex, indicative of remaining uncertainties/systematics in the literature. With the\nexception of [O/Fe], the range of element abundances\nappears roughly constant and independent of Rgc , with\nno evidence of a change from the inner to the outer disk.\nThe increase in [O/Fe] values from the inner disk through\nthe transition region is a mirror image of the [Fe/H] trend\nseen in Figure 4. This is due to a relationship between\n[O/Fe] and [Fe/H] that has been seen in numerous field\nstar studies (see, e.g., Bensby et al. 2005), and which has\nbeen attributed to the increased contribution of Type Ia\nsupernovae over time to the chemical enrichment of the\ndisk. However, the appearance of the trend is driven by\nthe innermost (Rgc .8 kpc) and outermost (Rgc & 15 kpc)\nobjects; the [O/Fe] distribution for Rgc \u223c9\u201314 kpc clusters is quite flat, and within the errors, consistent with\nthe solar ratio. The enhanced [O/Fe] of the few studiedto-date outer disk clusters is intriguing, as it hints at a\ndifferent chemical evolutionary history for the outer disk\n\n(e.g., Yong et al. 2005). It is important to confirm the\n[O/Fe] values for clusters based on analyses of 1-2 stars\nand/or on the oxygen IR triplet, which is known to suffer\nfrom NLTE effects (e.g., Be 29, Saurer 1; Carraro et al.\n2004).\nThe flat distributions of [X/Fe] with Rgc for the other\n\u03b1 elements is consistent with that seen in the inhomogeneous cluster sample of Pancino et al. (2010). They\nfound that clusters beyond Rgc \u223c15 kpc have slightly\nlarger [\u03b1/Fe] ratios than clusters inside this Rgc , but emphasized that the distribution is also consistent within\nthe errors of having zero slope. As seen in Figure 5, the\nouter disk clusters have slightly enhanced [Mg/Fe] ratios\ncompared to some inner disk clusters, but such is not the\ncase for Si, Ca or Ti (accounting for the dispersion in individual cluster Ti abundances from different studies).\nThe magnitude of the abundance dispersions seen in\nFigures 5 and 6 varies from element to element, with\n[Na/Fe] varying by \u223c0.2 dex, and the \u03b1 elements generally ranging 0.3\u20130.4 dex. Many clusters are enhanced in\nelements Mg, Si, Na and Al, as has been known for some\ntime (see, e.g., Friel 2006). If cluster mean abundance ratios do vary with Rgc , the magnitude of such variation is\nsmaller than the cluster abundance dispersions found in\nour study. The small dispersion in [Ni/Fe] seen for clusters across the full Rgc range of the disk is reassuring:\n\n\fAbundances in Rgc \u223c9-13 kpc Open Clusters\n\n19\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n\nFigure 6.

Abundance trends with [Fe/H]\nTrends of [X/Fe] with [Fe/H] are shown in Figure 7.\nOf them, [O/Fe] exhibits a clear trend with metallicity,\nwhile a similar trend in [Ca/Fe] with [Fe/H] may also\nbe present for our clusters especially (squares), though\nwe note such trends are weakened when individual cluster abundance dispersions (shown by the error bars) are\ntaken into account. The \u03b1 elements Mg and Si show\nno noticeable trends in [X/Fe] with [Fe/H], both for our\nsample alone and when other groups' clusters are considered. Clusters in general are predominantly enhanced in\nthese elements at all metallicities, as already discussed.\nAgain, note the the very different [X/Fe] ratios found\nfor individual clusters by different studies, connected by\ndashed lines here as in Figures 4-6. This contributes\nmuch to the scatter, especially for the element Ti.\nFigure 8 again shows open cluster [X/Fe] versus [Fe/H],\nbut with the addition of thin and thick disk field stars\nfrom Bensby et al. (2003, 2005). As in our earlier work,\nwe have shifted the abundance results of Bensby et al.\non to our abundance scale in an attempt to minimize\n\nsystematic differences (see Jacobson et al. 2011). As can\nbe seen, the clusters generally follow the field star trends\nwith [Fe/H], especially for elements O, Mg, Si, Ca, and\nNi. Even in cases where their abundances are systematically enhanced (Na, Si), the cluster locus is not far\nfrom the field star distributions. This does not hold in\nthe case of titanium, however, as can be seen in Figure 8.\nThe titanium abundances on our scale appear systematically low (squares and black crosses), though we note\nthat some other clusters have been found to have [Ti/Fe]\n\u223c \u22120.1 to \u22120.2 dex, (e.g., NGC 2324 \u2013 Bragaglia et al.\n2008; NGC 2099 \u2013 Pancino et al. 2010; Melotte 71 \u2013\nBrown et al. 1996). (Note that the Bensby et al. sample\non our scale is shifted up by \u223c0.2 dex; compare to Figure\n13 of Bensby et al. 2003.)\nThe difference between cluster and field star abundance distributions of the light elements Na and Al is\nin a sense systematic as well. The field star sample of\nBensby et al. is composed of solar-type dwarfs, while\nthe cluster abundances here have been determined exclusively from giant stars. The range of cluster [Na/Fe]\nratios is in much better agreement with that of field red\nclump stars, which also show generally enhanced light\nelement abundances with no obvious trend with metallicity (see, e.g., Mishenina et al. 2006, their Figure 14).\nThere has been debate in the literature whether or not\n\n\f20\n\nJacobson, Pilachowski & Friel\n\n0.4\n\nO\n\nNa\n\nAl\n\nMg\n\nSi\n\nCa\n\nTi\n\nNi\n\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n\n0.4\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n[Fe/H]\n\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n-0.5\n\n[Fe/H]\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n[Fe/H]\n\nFigure 7. Open cluster [X/Fe] as a function of [Fe/H]. Symbols same as in Figure 4. Representative error bars for cluster mean abundance\nratios (indicating typical standard errors of the mean) are shown in each panel.\n\ndifferences in light element abundances between dwarfs\nand giants is real or merely a systematic error, namely\ndue to the incorrect assumption of LTE. Mishenina et\nal. (2006) determined NLTE Na abundances for their\nsample of red clump stars, and as already stated the resulting distribution is consistent with that of the cluster\nLTE Na abundances. Some studies have found differences between dwarf and giant light element abundances\nfor stars in the same cluster that cannot be the result of\nsystematic effects alone (e.g., Schuler et al. 2009, Pace\net al. 2010). Clearly, it would be worthwhile to include\nboth dwarfs and giant stars in cluster element abundance\nstudies to search for further evidence of abundance differences. At the very least, the different patterns of light\nelement abundances shown by dwarfs and giants should\nbe taken into consideration when comparing two different\ndisk populations, as in Figure 8.\n6.3. Abundance trends with Age\n\nThe clusters in our sample (including those of our previous work) span a wide range in age, from \u223c700 Myr\nto 10 Gyr. Figure 9 shows cluster trends of [Fe/H] and\n[X/Fe] with age. As has been well remarked upon in\nthe literature (e.g., Magrini et al. 2009, Pancino et al.\n2010), clusters exhibit no statistically significant trend\nof metallicity with age, and instead show a large dispersion (\u223c0.3-0.4 dex) at nearly all ages. This would imply\nthat the disk was relatively inhomogeneous when these\nclusters were formed, which is borne out by the lack of\nclear trends with age for other elements as well. In Friel\n\net al. (2010), we remarked on the trends of [O/Fe] and\n[Al/Fe] with age, shown by the twelve clusters in that\nstudy (open squares in Figure 9). The addition of the\nclusters in the current study has effectively erased the\ntrend in the case of oxygen, while the enhanced [Al/Fe]\nshown in M 67 and NGC 2158 (note that the latter value\nhas a large uncertainty) also weaken the trend with age\nfor that element. As with Rgc , the dispersion in cluster\n[X/Fe] as a function age varies from element to element,\nranging from 0.2 dex for Na, to 0.3\u20130.4 dex for, e.g., O\nand Ti.\n6.4. Chemical Evolution of the Milky Way Disk\nThere are two general classes of Milky Way disk chemical evolution models: one predicts abundance gradients\nshould flatten with time (e.g., Hou et al. 2000), while the\nother predicts a steepening with time (e.g., Chiappini et\nal. 2001). These contrasting predictions are the result of\ndiffering treatments of gas infall and the star formation\nrate (see, e.g., Magrini et al. 2009 for a succinct summary). Because open clusters span a wide range in age\nand location in the disk, their abundance patterns are\ncrucial to constraining chemical evolution models.\nThe temporal variations in open cluster element abundance distributions have been investigated by many researchers, more recent examples being Magrini et al.\n(2009) and Andreuzzi et al. (2010; hereafter A10). Both\nthese studies used at least in part inhomogeneous cluster samples with chemical abundances collected from the\nliterature, though it is worth remembering that much of\n\n\fAbundances in Rgc \u223c9-13 kpc Open Clusters\n\n0.4\n\n21\n\nO\n\nNa\n\nAl\n\nMg\n\nSi\n\nCa\n\nTi\n\nNi\n\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n\n0.4\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n[Fe/H]\n\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n-0.5\n\n[Fe/H]\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n[Fe/H]\n\nFigure 8. Same as Figure 7, but with the addition of the thin (magenta crosses) and thick (orange open circles) disk field star samples\nfrom Bensby et al. (2003, 2005).\n\nthe literature results are now comprised of increasingly\nlarge, internally-consistent cluster samples analyzed by\nindividual groups. Some such samples are incorporated\nin the analysis presented here, and as already stated,\nmuch work has been done to either place abundance results on a common abundance scale or else to identify\nsources of systematic error between studies. Therefore,\nit is hoped that the picture presented here is less effected\nby systematic uncertainties than larger, heterogeneous\nliterature samples.\nThe combined cluster samples considered here span\nnearly the full age range of the disk, so in Figures 10\u201312\nwe have plotted the radial abundance distributions for\nthree different age groups. For ease of comparison to,\ne.g., Magrini et al. (2009) and A10, we have divided the\ncluster sample into those with ages 800 Myr and younger,\n800 Myr to 4 Gyr, and 4 Gyr and older. At most only\nfour clusters are in the youngest age bin, so we can make\nno statements about the metallicity distributions of the\nyoungest open clusters. For the older two age bins, one\ncan see that Figure 10 is very similar to that found in\nA10, although there is a difference in adopted distance\nscales.\nMetallicities of clusters 0.8\u20134 Gyr in age follow a negative linear gradient with relatively small dispersion out\nto Rgc \u223c14 kpc, where the distribution basically ends.\nA10 calculated a slope of \u2206[Fe/H]/\u2206Rgc = \u22120.07 for\nclusters interior to Rgc = 12 kpc (their Figure 19; middle panel). For the same Rgc range, we have found a\nslightly steeper value for middle-aged clusters in Fig-\n\nure 10: \u22120.083\u00b10.019 to \u22120.086\u00b10.015, depending on\nwhich [Fe/H] measures for NGC 2141 and NGC 6253\nare adopted. In contrast, the inner disk abundance distribution of the oldest clusters is more difficult to interpret given the smaller number of clusters inside 10\nkpc, but what clusters there are indicate a steeper slope\nthat flattens out at a smaller galactocentric distance:\n\u223c10 kpc. The slope, \u2206[Fe/H]/\u2206Rgc for the oldest clusters inside Rgc = 12 kpc ranges from \u22120.115\u00b10.045\nto \u22120.134\u00b10.035, depending on which [Fe/H] value is\nadopted for Cr 261. These values are slightly shallower\nthan that found by A10: \u22120.15. While we and A10 have\nfound evidence for a flattening of the gradient with time,\nsimilar to that of, e.g., Magrini et al. (2009), it must be\nemphasized that the different Rgc ranges spanned by the\nintermediate- and old-aged clusters may well influence\nthis interpretation.\nAnother interesting feature for the two older age bins in\nFigure 10 is the location of the transition from a gradient\nto the flat [Fe/H] distribution of the outer disk: for the\nintermediate-aged clusters, this transition appears to occur near or beyond Rgc \u223c14 kpc, where the cluster sample\nbasically ends. In contrast, the older clusters exhibit a\ntransition at a smaller galactocentric distance: \u223c10 kpc.\nCould this be an indication of a change in the chemical\nenrichment history of the disk? The uniformity of the\nolder population's abundance patterns may reflect the\ndomination of well-mixed infalling material on the enrichment history of the early disk, while the inner disk's\ngradient could be the result of the outward expansion of\n\n\f22\n\nJacobson, Pilachowski & Friel\n\n0.4\n\nFe\n\nNa\n\nAl\n\nO\n\nMg\n\nSi\n\nCa\n\nTi\n\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n0.4\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nage (Gyr)\n\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10 0\n\n2\n\nage (Gyr)\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nage (Gyr)\n\nFigure 9.

Here again one is struck by the flat distributions\nof [X/Fe] with Rgc for the oldest clusters. Once more,\n[O/Fe] stands out with a more intriguing pattern, but\nthis is a product of the [O/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] distribution\n(Figure 7), and the fact that oxygen abundances for\nmany clusters are still missing from the diagram, which\nmakes the picture more incomplete than for the other\n\u03b1 elements. The element radial distributions for the\nmiddle-aged clusters appear more varied than for the\nolder clusters. The reduced dispersion in [Mg/Fe] for\nthe oldest clusters compared to that of the intermediateaged clusters is noticeable. This can also be seen in Figure 9, which shows not only the decrease in dispersion\nof [Mg/Fe] with age, but the tendency for older clusters\nto typically have enhanced [Mg/Fe] ratios. How much of\nthis is attributable to selection biases is unclear. The distributions for the light elements shown in Figure 12 are\nessentially flat with large scatter, while [Ni/Fe] shows\nlittle, if any, variation with Rgc .\nThe open cluster chemical abundance patterns highlighted above and in the previous sections offer important constraints to theoretical models of the formation\nand evolution of the Milky Way disk. It must be kept\nin mind, however, that the clusters presented here com-\n\nprise only a small fraction of the total cluster population\nand that sample biases may influence the perceived abundance distributions in unknown ways. With that caveat,\nour current understanding of the open cluster chemical\nabundance distributions requires a disk chemical evolution model to reproduce:\n\u2022 A trend of decreasing [Fe/H] that then flattens out\nbeyond Rgc \u223c12 kpc.\n\u2022 Flat distributions with roughly constant dispersion\nacross the full extent of the disk for other element\n[X/Fe] ratios.\n\u2022 At most only a slight flattening of the [Fe/H] gradient inside Rgc \u223c12 kpc over time, and perhaps\na change in the location of the transition from the\ninner disk gradient to outer disk constant [Fe/H]\nto larger Galactocentric radii over time.\n\u2022 Little to no evolution of [X/Fe] radial distributions\nwith time, (bearing in mind the different Rgc ranges\nof the two older age bins in Figures 10-12).\n\u2022 No obvious trends of [Fe/H] or [X/Fe] with cluster\nage (though this may change once outer disk cluster\n[O/Fe] ratios are better constrained).\n\n\fAbundances in Rgc \u223c9-13 kpc Open Clusters\n\n0.5\n\n23\n\n(a) age<0.8 Gyr\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n0.5\n\n20\n\n25\n\n(b) age 0.8 to 4 Gyr\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n0.5\n\n20\n\n25\n\n(c) age 4+ Gyr\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nFigure 10.

(2006)? Possible trends of abundance with Rgc may well be smoothed out for a cluster\npopulation that spans a wide range of Galactic longitude\nor different Galactic quadrants. Unfortunately, the number of clusters for which we have detailed abundance patterns is insufficient to properly investigate this question,\nand indeed it is possible that the spatial distribution in\nthe disk of the currently-known population of clusters is\ntoo scant to answer this question with clusters alone.\nAnother important question is the effect of radial migration of stars in the disk on the interpretation of radial\nchemical abundance patterns (see, e.g., Sellwood & Binney 2002). It has been implicitly assumed that open\nclusters are unaffected by radial migration forces, either\nbecause most clusters are dissolved before migration can\noccur, or else some clusters (especially many of the older\nclusters still around today) have orbits that keep them\nout of the densest parts of disk for most of their lives.\nYet, recent simulations of radial migration seem to indi-\n\ncate that clusters can change their orbits via interactions\nwith transient spiral density waves, especially those on\nnear-circular orbits confined to the disk (Ro\u0161kar et al.\n2008). A general consequence of radial migration would\nbe a flattening of any existing abundance gradient in the\ndisk, as stars from the metal-poor outer disk migrate\ninwards and vice versa. In their recent study of open\ncluster orbits, Wu et al. (2009) plotted cluster [Fe/H]\nversus apogalactic distance and found it to be very similar to the metallicity distribution found using clusters'\ncurrent Rgc values. A10 have stated that this implies\nthat clusters are little affected by migration and therefore the observed abundance distributions are indicative\nof the state of the disk at the time they formed. However, our understanding is that current radial migration\nmodels show that interaction with transient spiral density waves can move objects 1,2,3 kpc from their birth\nradii while still maintaining their circular orbits, so it\nis unclear why one would expect that any difference between abundance distributions of clusters at their current\nRgc values and their apogalactic positions would be an\nindication of the presence of radial migration.\nHowever, as already stated, if radial migration is an\nimportant factor in open cluster kinematics, any metallicity gradient would be slowly washed out over time,\n\n\f24\n\nJacobson, Pilachowski & Friel\n\n0.4\n\nage<0.8 Gyr\n\nage 0.8-4 Gyr\n\nage 4+ Gyr\n\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nFigure 11.

Left column:\nclusters younger than 800 Myr; middle column: clusters 800 Myr to 4 Gyr old; right column: clusters 4 Gyr and older. Representative\nstandard deviations of the weighted mean [X/Fe] for our cluster sample are indicated in the lower right corner of the left-most panels.\n\nwith the oldest clusters exhibiting a shallower gradient\nthan younger clusters. The fact that the older clusters\nappear to exhibit a slightly steeper gradient than the\nyounger clusters may very well indicate that migration is\nnot important. Therefore, assuming for now that open\nclusters are not affected by radial migration as field stars\nare, a natural question to ask is whether the more metalpoor outer disk clusters have similar abundance patterns\nto metal poor solar neighborhood field stars? If they\noriginated from the same part of the disk, then it seems\nreasonable that they should. The picture indicated in\nFigure 8 is difficult to interpret in this context, since it\nis uncertain what systematic affects may still be present\nbetween the open cluster giant star abundances and the\nfield dwarf star abundances. A differential abundance\nanalysis of nearby field stars and outer disk open clusters,\nbased on data taken with the same telescope/instrument\ncombination, would be the ideal way to explore this question.\nAs pointed out by A10, the general radial element\nabundance distributions \u2013 namely, the flattening out in\nthe outer disk \u2013 can be explained as both a natural consequence of disk formation and evolution (e.g., Carraro\net al. 2007) or as a consequence of satellite mergers (e.g.,\nYong et al. 2005, Carraro & Bensby 2009). Can any of\n\nthe other abundance patterns discussed here distinguish\nbetween these two scenarios? The homogeneity of outer\ndisk abundances is an important constraint: if it was\nbuilt by mergers, then the chemical composition of the\nmerging material would need to be rather finely tuned to\ncreate such homogeneity, as discussed by Magrini et al.\n(2009). Indeed, the flat distribution of [X/Fe] across the\nfull extent of the disk, especially for the older clusters\n(which the outer disk population is a part of) as seen in\nFigures 11 and 12, seem to imply a similar chemical evolutionary history across the extent of the disk. It goes\nwithout saying that a larger cluster sample in the outer\ndisk would be extremely helpful, not only to better constrain the abundance distributions but also the age range\nof objects in the outer disk.\n7. SUMMARY\n\nWe have presented a detailed chemical abundance\nstudy of ten open clusters based on single-order echelle\nspectra of giant stars obtained with the Hydra multiobject spectrograph on the WIYN 3.5m telescope. To\nour knowledge, this is the first detailed abundance study\nfor four clusters in our sample: NGC 1245, NGC 2194,\nNGC 2355 and NGC 2425.

Same as Figure 11, for [Na/Fe], [Al/Fe] and [Ni/Fe].\n\nsynthesis, we have determined abundances for the elements Fe, O, Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Ni and Zr, and for\ntwo clusters in the sample, Al and Cr. Of these, the\nMg and Cr abundances have relatively large uncertainty,\nas they are based on the measurement of one line only.\nWe previously carried out an abundance analysis for four\nclusters in this sample, M 67, NGC 188, NGC 1817 and\nNGC 2158, based on multi-order KPNO 4m echelle spectra of one to four stars per cluster. Comparison of the\nresults from the current study to these found general\ngood agreement in atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances for three of the clusters, though with\nthe cluster mean [Fe/H] determined in this study being\nslightly lower than found from the KPNO 4m data. As\nagreement between the two analyses is generally good\nfor individual stars, this difference in metallicity is likely\ndue to the increased number of stars analyzed in the current sample leading to a more robust result. The mean\nmetallicity for NGC 2158, [Fe/H] = \u22120.28\u00b10.10 (s.d.) is\nsignificantly lower than found in an earlier study (\u22120.03;\nJacobson et al. 2009), which we attribute to differences\nin temperature scales.\nThis cluster sample was selected to explore the element\nabundance trends with Galactocentric distance within\nthe range Rgc \u223c9-13 kpc, in order to better characterize\nthe transition between the inner and outer Milky Way\n\ndisk. This sample supplements the twelve clusters from\nour previous work that occupy this same range in Galactocentric radius, and we have further combined our sample with those of other groups to investigate cluster abundance trends over the full radial extent of the disk. We\nhave found that distribution of cluster [Fe/H] appears\nto be smooth through the transition between the inner\nand outer disk, with a gradual decrease in [Fe/H] with\nincreasing Rgc , at least through Rgc \u223c13 kpc, although\nthis trend is rather dependent on the abundances of a\nfew key clusters at Rgc \u223c12 kpc, such as NGC 2158. The\ndistribution of cluster mean [X/Fe] ratios for most other\nelements also appears continuous and flat for the full extent of the Galactic disk, with 0.2\u20130.4 dex dispersion at\nleast in the inner disk and transition region which are\nwell sampled. A flat distribution in [X/Fe] across the\ndisk implies that the chemical evolution of the outer disk\nis similar to that of the inner disk. For example, the comparable [\u03b1/Fe] ratios of inner disk and outer disk clusters\nindicates that the relative contributions of Type Ia and\nType II supernovae were similar in the two regions.\nThe element abundance patterns of the clusters studied here do not appear to exhibit any trends with cluster\nage, as has been seen by other studies. In general, our results are qualitatively similar to those found from larger,\nheterogeneous cluster samples (Pancino et al. 2010), al-\n\n\f26\n\nJacobson, Pilachowski & Friel\n\nthough much more work must be done to understand and\nminimize systematic differences among different studies.\nUntil such work is done, any real changes in cluster abundance patterns present in the disk on the level of 0.3 to\n0.2 dex or smaller cannot be considered reliable. In a\nsimilar vein, it is as yet still difficult to make a detailed\ncomparison of cluster abundance ratios to those of solar\nneighborhood field stars. For now, all one can say with\nconfidence is that cluster [X/Fe] ratios have the same\ngeneral trends with [Fe/H] as do thin and thick disk stars.\nPlots of cluster element abundance ratios versus Rgc\nand [Fe/H] for two different age ranges of clusters (0.8\u2013\n4 Gyr and 4+ Gyr) show some possible differences in\nslope. For example, the older clusters show remarkably\nflat distributions of [X/Fe] with Rgc , while the younger\nclusters may show a hint of increasing [X/Fe] with Rgc\nfor some elements (though the narrower Rgc range of this\nsample should be kept in mind).\nAs such, the exact nature of the transition between the\ninner and outer disk remains ambiguous, and the question of whether or not the outer disk was formed as a natural part of disk evolution or from merger events remains\nunanswered. Remaining systematic errors between abundance studies of different research groups must be minimized, and the abundance ratios of some key clusters\nbetter constrained by more observations, before we can\ncome closer to answering these questions. The inner disk\nmust not be neglected in this research, either. We note\nthe recent work of Magrini et al. (2010) on three clusters\nwith Rgc \u223c6\u20137 kpc that found indications of a steepening\nof the [Fe/H] distribution towards the Galactic center,\nas has been found for Cepheids at similar Galactocentric\nlocation (e.g., Andrievsky et al. 2002b).\nThat said, we as a research field have come far in a few\nshort years in improving our understanding of the chemical abundance distribution of the Galactic disk. Continued efforts, both on a cluster by cluster basis as individual groups continue to increase their sample sizes, and\non survey-sized scales with the likes of APOGEE9 and\nHERMES10 and Gaia11 promise even further advances\nin our understanding.\nWe are grateful to the referee for suggestions that improved the presentation of this research.

Where relevant, the distance determination based on cluster red clump star luminosity is also described.\nA discussion of metallicity and element abundance determinations for each cluster is found in Appendix B.\n\u2022 M 67: M 67 (l = 215.6o, b = +31.7o) is one of the most well-studied clusters in the Milky Way disk. Cluster\nmembership has been reliably determined using both radial velocity (Mathieu et al. 1986) and proper motion\n(Sanders 1977) studies. The canonical photometry study of M 67 is that of Montgomery, Marschall & Janes\n(1993). They found E(B\u2212V)=0.05\u00b10.01 and (m\u2212M)V = 9.6, though they remarked on the poor match between\nthe data and theoretical isochrones. Twarog et al. (1997) used their photometry and found (m\u2212M)V = 9.8\u00b10.2,\nassuming E(B\u2212V)=0.04. M 67 was one of the clusters used for calibration in GS02 and CLD05, so the distance\ndetermination using red clump stars indicates the robustness of the method. Confirmed cluster member red\nclump giant stars in M 67 have been identified in both photometric and spectroscopic studies of the cluster.\nUsing 2MASS photometry of seven red clump stars, the average clump K-band magnitude and J\u2212K color are\n7.959\u00b10.023, 0.638\u00b10.023. Using the CLD05 relation, E(J\u2212K) = 0.022\u00b10.029, E(B\u2212V) = 0.041\u00b10.029, and\nAK = 0.014. This results in a distance modulus (K\u2212MK )0 = 9.605\u00b10.064, which corresponds to a distance d =\n834\u00b125 pc, and Rgc = 9.09\u00b10.02 kpc, z = 438\u00b113 pc. These values are in excellent agreement with those of,\ne.g., Twarog et al. (1997; d = 860\u00b150 pc). On the scale of Salaris et al. (2004), M 67 has an age of 4.3\u00b10.5\nGyr. Stellar ID's come from WEBDA (based on the identifications of Fagerholm (1906)), while photometry and\nalternate identifications come from Montgomery, Marschall & Janes (1993). Coordinates given in Table 3 are\nthose of Fan et al. (1996). We have used E(B\u2212V) = 0.04\u00b10.02 and (m\u2212M)0 = 9.68\u00b10.20 (Twarog et al. 1997)\nfor determination of stellar atmospheric parameters.\n\u2022 NGC 188: Along with M 67, NGC 188 (l = 122.8o, b = +22.5o) is an extremely well-studied open cluster. It is\nalso one of the older open clusters, with an age of 6.3\u00b10.8 Gyr (Salaris et al. 2004). We refer the reader to Fornal\net al. (2007) for a summary of previous studies in the literature. As in our previous study of NGC 188 stars (Friel\net al. 2010), we chose not to determine the cluster's fundamental parameters based on red clump morphology,\ngiven the difficulty in identifying red clump stars. Instead, we have adopted the distance and reddening found\nby Sarajedini et al. (1999): E(B\u2212V) = 0.09\u00b10.02, d = 1.70\u00b10.07 kpc, Rgc = 9.40\u00b10.09 kpc, z = +650\u00b130 pc.\nThese are in excellent agreement with, e.g., the findings of Twarog et al. (1997). Incidentally, Van Helshoecht\n& Groenewegen (2007) included NGC 188 in their investigation of open cluster K-band red clump luminosity.\nThe stars they identified as red clump stars have MK = \u22121.40 in the 2MASS magnitude system, which, working\nbackwards with their choice of cluster reddening and distance modulus, indicates a mean clump K = 9.67. This\nvalue agrees with the K magnitudes of stars tentatively identified as members of the red clump by Sarajedini\net al. (1999), as described in Friel et al. (2010). The resulting distance modulus, using MK,0 = \u22121.66, is 11.33\nmagnitudes, or \u223c0.2 magnitudes larger than found by other photometric studies. In Table 3, identifications are\nfrom WEBDA, while alternate ID's, J2000 coordinates and photometry are from Platais et al. (2003).\n\u2022 NGC 1245: The first photometric studies of NGC 1245 (l = 146.6o, b = \u22128.9o) were carried out in the 1960's\n(Hoag et al. 1961, Chincarini 1964). It is a very rich cluster, 1.1\u00b10.2 Gyr old (Salaris et al. 2004) and with a\npopulous red giant clump. It has been the subject of several CCD photometric studies in the past two decades,\nbut at least one appears to be troubled with incorrect color calibrations (Subramaniam 2003). Carraro & Patat\n(1994) found evidence for differential extinction across the field of the cluster, based on star counts in different\nregions of the field; Wee & Lee (1996) also found differential reddening, but found it to increase in the opposite\ndirection. Burke et al. (2004) presented BVI photometry of a very large area around the cluster and found no\nevidence of variable extinction. Values for interstellar reddening range from E(B\u2212V) = 0.21 (Burke et al. 2004)\nto 0.28 (Wee & Lee 1996). Distance moduli vary from (m\u2212M)0 = 12.0 (Wee & Lee 1996) to 12.4 (Carraro &\nPatat 1994, Subramaniam 2003, Burke et al. 2004). We identified red clump stars by eye in the cluster 2MASS\nJK CMD, which features a very broad, crowded red clump at (K, J\u2212K) \u223c 11.1\u00b10.2, 0.64\u00b10.10. Assuming\nsolar metallicity for the cluster, E(J\u2212K) = 0.024\u00b10.102, and E(B\u2212V) = 0.045\u00b10.102, AK = 0.015. These\nvalues are much lower than found by the studies mentioned above. Nonetheless, the resulting distance modulus,\n(K\u2212MK )0 = 12.4\u00b10.2, is consistent with literature values. This places NGC 1245 3.0\u00b10.3 kpc from the Sun,\nwith Rgc = 11.1\u00b10.3 kpc, and z = \u2212460\u00b150 pc. Stellar identifications come from Chincarini (1964); alternate\n\n\fAbundances in Rgc \u223c9-13 kpc Open Clusters\n\n29\n\nID's come from Wee & Lee (1996). J2000 coordinates have been taken from the USNO-B1.0 catalog12 . The\noptical photometry listed in Table 3 come from Subramaniam (2003), save for star 382, for which we give the\nphotoelectric photometry from Jennens & Helfer (1975). Additional likely evolved star targets were selected from\nthe 2MASS JK CMD of the cluster. These targets have been given arbitrary identification numbers starting\nwith 900. Given the possible large zero-point offsets for the Subramaniam photometry (see Burke et al. 2004\nfor discussion), we determined stellar atmospheric parameters using J\u2212K colors only. For these calculations,\nwe have adopted the distance and reddening values of Burke et al. (2004): E(B\u2212V) = 0.21\u00b10.03, (m\u2212M)0 =\n12.27\u00b10.02.\n\u2022 NGC 1817: A summary of previous studies of NGC 1817 (l = 186.1o , b = \u221213.1o) was given in our first study\nof stars in this cluster (Jacobson et al. 2009). There, we did not determine its distance and reddening using\nits red clump morphology since it was used as a calibration cluster by GS02. Instead, we adopted the findings\nof Balaguer-N\u00fa\u00f1ez et al. (2004b), who found E(B\u2212V) = 0.27, (m\u2212M)0 = 10.9\u00b10.6, d = 1.5\u00b10.5 kpc, Rgc =\n10.0\u00b10.4 kpc, z = \u2212340\u00b1100 pc. However, as for M 67, we have determined its fundamental parameters using\nits red clump photometry in order to compare with other findings in the literature. In actuality, identification\nof red clump stars in the 2MASS CMD is difficult, and restricting the analysis to radial velocity and/or proper\nmotion members does not make identification easier. This is due to the extended appearance of the red clump,\neven in optical CMDs, as noted by Mermilliod et al. (2003). Van Helshoecht & Groenewegen (2007) cautioned\nthat inclusion of noncluster members can alter the red clump morphology and the determined distance and\nreddening to clusters; NGC 1817 serves as a useful example of this, and even of how the inclusion/exclusion\nof member stars can alter the results when the red clump is especially extended. For example, depending\non whether a red star clump is identified in the cluster 2MASS CMD with no membership information, with\nmembership information, or with cross-identification of clump stars in the optical CMDs of Mermilliod et al.\n(2003) or Balaguer-N\u00fa\u00f1ez et al. (2004b), the mean red clump K-band magnitude and J\u2212K color can differ by\nmore than 0.3 and 0.04 magnitudes, respectively, with dispersions of up to 0.2 and 0.1 magnitudes. The E(J\u2212K)\nvalues range from 0.05 to 0.09, indicating E(B\u2212V) = 0.15\u20130.18 \u2013 much lower values than found by other studies\nin the literature. Corresponding absolute distance moduli range from 11.1 to 11.5, which are also larger than\nfound by other studies. As a result of this, we have chosen to use the reddening and distance to NGC 1817\nfound by Balaguer-N\u00fa\u00f1ez et al. (2004b), as we did in Jacobson et al. (2009). Star identifications for this 1.1\u00b10.2\nGyr old cluster (Salaris et al. 2004) have been taken from WEBDA, and are those of Cuffy (1938). Alternative\nID's in Table 3 come from Balaguer-N\u00fa\u00f1ez et al. (2004b). Note that the photometry listed in Table 3 are Vby\nphotometry from Balaguer-N\u00fa\u00f1ez et al. (2004b), and the coordinates are from Balaguer-N\u00fa\u00f1ez et al. (2004a).\n\u2022 NGC 2158: A summary of previous studies of NGC 2158 (l = 186o.6 , b = +1o .8) was presented in Jacobson\net al. (2009). As described there, GS02 determined fundamental parameters for NGC 2158 based on their\ncalibration of the red clump star K magnitude as a distance indicator. They found E(B\u2212V)=0.430\u00b10.013 and\n(m\u2212M)V =14.38\u00b10.09 (corresponding to a distance of \u223c4 kpc from the Sun). Using their values for the clump's\n<MK > and <(J\u2212K)>, and adopting [Fe/H] = \u22120.30 for the cluster, we redetermined the distance modulus\nand reddening for this study: E(J\u2212K) = 0.225\u00b10.033, E(B\u2212V) = 0.417\u00b10.033, (K\u2212MK )0 = 13.03\u00b10.06. These\nvalues are in excellent agreement with GS02, as they should be. These values correspond to d = 4036\u00b1125\npc, Rgc = 12.5\u00b10.1 kpc, and z = 127\u00b14 kpc. Stellar identifications come from WEBDA, and alternate ID's\nand stellar photometry from Carraro et al. (2002), save for star 4230. Photometry for this star has been taken\nfrom the photographic study of Arp & Cuffey (1962; star \"c\" in their catalog). Stellar coordinates are from the\nUSNO-B1.0 catalog. NGC 2158 has an age of 1.9\u00b10.5 Gyr on the scale of Salaris et al. (2004). We have adopted\nthe distance and reddening of GS02 for NGC 2158 for the determination of stellar atmospheric parameters.\n\u2022 NGC 2194: The CCD photometry studies of NGC 2194 (l = 197o .3 , b = \u22122o .3) include Sanner et al. (2000),\nPiatti et al. (2003) and Kyeong et al. (2005). The main sequence found by each of these studies is very broad,\nindicating a high degree of variability in interstellar extinction, the presence of a prominent binary main sequence,\nlarge uncertainties in the photometry, or some combination of these effects. All these studies agree on its young\nage, with values ranging from 400\u2013630 Myr, and the cluster exhibits a well-populated red clump and several\nblue straggler candidates. Salaris et al. (2004) found a slightly older age of 900\u00b1200 Myr, based on its CMD\nmorphology. Reddening estimates from these three studies range E(B\u2212V) = 0.40\u20130.47, while distance moduli\nvary (m\u2212M)0 =12.1\u201312.5. We determined the reddening and distance to the cluster based on the JK photometry\nof its red clump stars. Red clump stars were identified by eye in the 2MASS CMD, as well as by cross-checking\nwith red clump stars identified in the optical photometry studies of Piatti et al. (2003) and Kyeong et al. (2005).\nKyeong et al. also obtained JHK photometry of the cluster, and our determined red clump K-band magnitude and\n(J\u2212K) color, 10.2\u00b10.1, 0.78\u00b10.03 is in good agreement with their values (differences in filter systems considered).\nUsing these values and assuming [Fe/H] = 0, we found E(J\u2212K) = 0.165\u00b10.037, E(B\u2212V) = 0.306\u00b10.037, AK =\n0.103. The absolute distance modulus, (K\u2212MK )0 = 11.4\u00b10.2, which is much smaller than the values of Sanner et\nal., Piatti et al., & Kyeong et al. This difference can largely be ascribed to our use of the larger age of Salaris et\nal. (2004) to determine the mean clump luminosity: MK = \u22121.3\u00b10.1, as opposed to \u22121.6 used by Kyeong et al.\nOur distance modulus for NGC 2194 corresponds to d = 1903\u00b1120 pc, Rgc = 10.3\u00b10.2 kpc, and z = \u221280\u00b15 pc.\n12\n\nSee http://www.nofs.navy.mil/data/FchPix/\n\n\f30\n\nJacobson, Pilachowski & Friel\nStellar identifications and J2000 coordinates come from Sanner et al. (2000) and are also those used in WEBDA.\nAlso shown in Table 3 are the ID's from Cuffey (1943), and the stellar photometry from Sanner et al. The\nreddening and distance modulus of Sanner et al. were also used to determine stellar atmospheric parameters.\n\u2022 NGC 2355: CCD photometry studies of NGC 2355 (l = 203o .4 , b = +11o.8) are those of Kaluzny &\nMazur(1991b), Phelps et al. (1994), and most recently, Ann et al. (1999). Reddening values and distance\nmoduli from this small number of studies are quite different, with E(B\u2212V) values ranging from 0.12 to 0.25,\nand (m\u2212M)0 ranging from 12.1 to 11.4 (both Kaluzny & Mazur 1991, Ann et al. 1999, respectively). This\nintermediate-aged cluster (0.8 Gyr; Salaris et al. 2004) has an identifiable red clump that we used to determine\nits distance and reddening. Soubiran et al. (2000) presented a proper motion study of the cluster, and also\ndetermined radial velocities, atmospheric parameters, and metallicities for several stars in the field by matching\nR\u223c40,000, S/N\u223c15, spectra to a library of template spectra. Combining their results with the photometry of\nKaluzny & Mazur (1991) and 2MASS (Cutri et al. 2003), they determined NGC 2355 to have E(B\u2212V)=0.16 and\n(m\u2212M)0 =11.06\u00b10.10. The JK CMD of the cluster field shows a lot of field star contamination, so even with\nthe identification of radial velocity members, it was difficult to identify the exact location of the red clump. We\nhave identified the red clump as having (K, J\u2212K) = 10.1\u00b10.1, 0.62\u00b10.03. Assuming [Fe/H] = 0 for the cluster,\nE(J\u2212K) = 0.022\u00b10.044, and E(B\u2212V) = 0.041\u00b10.044, AK = 0.014. As found for other clusters, this reddening\nvalue is much lower than that found by other studies. That said, the absolute distance modulus, (K\u2212MK )0 =\n11.43\u00b10.14, is consistent with that found by, e.g., Ann et al. (1999). This places NGC 2355 1928\u00b1130 pc from\nthe Sun, at Rgc = 10.3\u00b10.1 kpc, z = 400\u00b125 pc.\nAlso, Soubiran et al. remarked upon the presence of a very bright giant star, two magnitudes brighter than\nthe red clump in V-band, but which has the same color and temperature of the clump stars and is a radial\nvelocity member. This star (# 398) is also in our sample, and we confirm its membership. A high-resolution\nspectrum of this star is publicly available from the ELODIE archive13 , and is of high enough S/N to carry out\na detailed abundance analysis. We used this spectrum in addition to our own in the analysis of this cluster.\nStellar identifications come from Ann et al. (1999; these are the ID's adopted in WEBDA). The identifications\nof Kaluzny & Mazur (1991) are also given, along with their BV photometry for all stars save 144, 203 and 668,\nfor which we give the photometry of Ann et al. (1999). Stellar coordinates come from Lasker et al. (1990). For\ncalculation of stellar atmospheric parameters, we adopted the reddening and distance modulus of Soubiran et al.\n\u2022 NGC 2420: NGC 2420 is a canonical metal-poor cluster that resides in the outer disk (l = 198o.1, b = +19o .6).\nOn the age-scale of Salaris et al. (2004), it is 2.2\u00b10.3 Gyr old. It has been the subject of numerous photometry\nstudies over the past four decades or more, all of which indicate low values of extinction towards the cluster:\nE(B\u2212V)\u22480.04 (e.g., West 1967; McClure et al. 1974; Anthony-Twarog et al. 2006; Sharma et al. 2006). Distance\nmoduli range from (m\u2212M)0 = 11.4\u201311.9 (McClure et al. 1974; Twarog et al. 1997), with the majority of studies\nfinding the latter value. NGC 2420 is used by GS02 as calibration of their relation, so here again our analysis\nusing the red clump morphology serves as validation of the relation. Red clump stars were identified in the Vby\nCMD of Anthony-Twarog et al. (2006). The mean (K, J\u2212K) of 12 clump stars is 10.330\u00b10.241, 0.615\u00b10.021.\nAdopting [Fe/H] = \u22120.20, E(J\u2212K) = 0.038\u00b10.038, E(B\u2212V) = 0.071\u00b10.038, AK = 0.024. This reddening is\nslightly larger than that found by the studies mentioned above. (K\u2212MK )0 = 11.97\u00b10.04, which is also slightly\nlarger than that found by previous studies. This indicates a distance of 2473\u00b1285 pc from the Sun, or Rgc =\n10.7\u00b10.3 kpc, z = 830\u00b1100 pc for NGC 2420. Stellar identifications are those used in WEBDA, and come from\nCannon & Lloyd (1970). Alternative ID's are from West (1967) and we also used the photometry of AnthonyTwarog et al. (1990; Table 3) and Anthony-Twarog et al. (2006). For stars 131 and 255, not in the catalog of\nAnthony-Twarog et al. (1990), we give the BV photometry of Sharma et al. (2006). J2000 coordinates are from\nthe USNO-B1.0 catalog. Additional likely evolved star targets were selected from the 2MASS JK CMD of the\ncluster. These targets have been given arbitrary identification numbers starting with 8000. The reddening value\nE(B\u2212V) = 0.050\u00b10.004 (Anthony-Twarog et al. 2006) and distance modulus (m\u2212M)0 = 11.9\u00b10.2 (Twarog et\nal. 1997) were used to calculate stellar temperatures and gravities.\n\u2022 NGC 2425: NGC 2425 is located at l = 231o.5 , b = +3o .3. It is a relatively little-studied, old cluster, with the\nfirst photometric studies done in 2006. The UBV(RI)C photometry of Moitinho et al. (2006) extends down to\nV\u223c21 and revealed a clear red clump and sparse giant branch. The BVI photometry of Pietrukowicz et al. (2006)\nextends down to a similar magnitude. These two studies found E(B\u2212V)\u223c0.21-0.29 and (m\u2212M)V =13.2\u201313.6,\nand age 2.2\u20132.5 Gyr based on ZAMS-fitting and matches to theoretical isochrones. Stellar identifications are\nthose used in WEBDA, and come from Pietrukowicz et al. (2006). We determined the distance and reddening\nto the cluster based on the 2MASS photometry of its red clump stars. The red clump was identified in the\ncluster 2MASS CMD, with the aid of radial velocity information to remove non-members. We found (K, J\u2212K)\n= 10.87\u00b10.04, 0.76\u00b10.02 for the clump. Adopting [Fe/H] = \u22120.10, E(J\u2212K) = 0.16\u00b10.04, E(B\u2212V) = 0.30\u00b10.04,\nAK = 0.10. (K\u2212MK )0 = 12.43\u00b10.07, which is consistent with literature values. These place NGC 2425 3062\u00b1100\npc from the Sun, at Rgc = 10.7\u00b10.1 kpc, z = 180\u00b110 pc. Photometry comes from Pietrukowicz et al. (2006), and\nalternate ID's from Moitinho et al. (2006). Stellar coordinates were taken from the USNO-B1.0 catalog.\n\n13\n\nSee http://atlas.obs-hp.fr/elodie/intro.html\n\n\fAbundances in Rgc \u223c9-13 kpc Open Clusters\n\n31\n\n\u2022 NGC 7789: NGC 7789 (l = 115o.5 , b = \u22125o .4) is another well-studied, rich open cluster. The first photometric\nstudy of it was performed by Burbidge & Sandage (1958) who obtained UBV photographic and photoelectric\nphotometry down to V\u223c16 and determined E(B\u2212V) = 0.28, (m\u2212M)0 = 11.36\u00b10.20 for the cluster. Photometry\nstudies since then have found interstellar extinction values ranging from E(B\u2212V) = 0.24\u00b10.01 (Janes 1977) to\nE(B\u2212V) = 0.28\u00b10.02 (Gim et al. 1998b), with some studies finding E(B\u2212V)\u22480.27 (e.g., Twarog et al. 1997,\nBreger & Wheeler 1980). Distance moduli generally range from (m\u2212M)V = 11.5\u201312.45 in these studies. NGC\n7789 has also been the subject of detailed proper motion (McNamara & Solomon 1981) and radial velocity (Gim\net al. 1998a) studies. NGC 7789 has a very tight, well-populated red clump that we used to determine its distance\nand reddening. The clump's position is very clear in the 2MASS CMD, though we also made use of the clump\nstar identifications of Gim et al. (1998b). We have found (K, J\u2212K) = 10.1\u00b10.2, 0.72\u00b10.10. Assuming solar\nmetallicity for the cluster, E(J\u2212K) = 0.10\u00b10.10, E(B\u2212V) = 0.19\u00b10.10, and AK = 0.063. This reddening value\nis \u223c0.1 magnitude lower than that found by other studies. However, the resulting distance modulus, (K\u2212MK )0\n= 11.70\u00b10.21, is in the mid-range of values found in the literature, and agrees within the errors, with that of\nTwarog et al. (1997). This places NGC 7789 2185\u00b1210 pc from the Sun, with Rgc = 9.6\u00b10.2 kpc, and z =\n\u2212206\u00b120 pc. Stellar identifications are from WEBDA (originally from Gim et al. 1998b), and the photometry\nis taken from Mochejska & Kaluzny (1999). The identifications and 1950B coordinates from K\u00fcstner (1923) are\nalso given for each star.\nCOMPARISON TO LITERATURE ABUNDANCE RESULTS\n\nIn this appendix we compare our abundance results to those found in the literature. As already discussed, some\nclusters (e.g., M 67) have been subject to numerous detailed abundance studies, and where such studies exist, we\ngenerally confine the discussion to them. However, some clusters have been subject to photometric studies only, in\nwhich case we compare our [Fe/H] values with photometric metallicities.\n\u2022 M 67: We have previously made a careful comparison of the results of three different high resolution spectroscopic\nstudies of M 67; we refer the reader to Friel et al. (2010) for details. The mean metallicity for M 67 determined\nfrom the Hydra spectra, [Fe/H] = \u22120.01\u00b10.05 is in excellent agreement with other studies of this solar metallicity\ncluster. Agreement among different studies for the abundances of other elements is not as good, however. For\nexample, Tautvai\u0161ien\u0117 et al.(2000) and Yong et al. (2005) found larger enhancements of [Na/Fe] for this cluster\nthan did we or Pancino et al. (2010). Our [Ca/Fe] ratio is intermediate between those of Pancino et al., Yong\net al. and Tautvai\u0161ien\u0117 et al., while our [Ti/Fe] and [O/Fe] ratios are lower than those of all three studies. As\nthese different studies generally rely on the same samples of M 67 giants, and the agreement in atmospheric\nparameters is reasonable, these abundance differences are likely due to details in the different analyses.\n\u2022 NGC 188: Though many spectroscopic studies of NGC 188 exist in the literature, relatively few of them focus\non the determination of Fe or elements heavier than the light elements. Hobbs et al. (1990) found [Fe/H] =\n\u22120.12\u00b10.16 based on a study of seven stars in the cluster. Randich et al. (2003) found [Fe/H] = +0.01\u00b10.08\nbased on co-added spectra of main sequence stars. These values are in good agreement with our value of [Fe/H]\n= \u22120.03\u00b10.04.\n\u2022 NGC 1245: To our knowledge, this is the first detailed chemical abundance study of NGC 1245; previous\nmetallicity estimates have been determined from photometry. NGC 1245 has [Fe/H] = +0.14 in the Lyng\u00e5's\nopen cluster catalog (Lyng\u00e5 1987). Based on Washington photometry, Wee & Lee (1996) found [Fe/H] =\n\u22120.04\u00b10.05, in excellent agreement with our value of [Fe/H] = \u22120.04\u00b10.05, as is the value found by Burke et\nal. using isochrone-fitting (2004: \u22120.05\u00b10.03).\n\u2022 NGC 1817: Parisi et al. (2005) determined a metallicity for NGC 1817 based on Washington photometry of\n15 cluster stars. They found [Fe/H] = \u22120.33\u00b10.08. This is in decent agreement with our value of [Fe/H] =\n\u22120.16\u00b10.03 based on 28 stars. In our analysis of KPNO 4m echelle spectra of two stars in this cluster (Jacobson\net al. 2009), we remarked that the E(B\u2212V) value adopted by Parisi et al. (2005) was slightly lower than that\nfound by Balaguer-N\u00fa\u00f1ez et al.(2004b), which we have adopted here. Use of E(B\u2212V) = 0.27 instead of E(B\u2212V)\n= 0.23 would increase the metallicity found from the Washington photometric indices by \u223c0.15 dex, to [Fe/H]\n\u2248 \u22120.16 dex, in excellent agreement with our value.\n\u2022 NGC 2158: To our knowledge, the only high resolution spectroscopic abundance study of NGC 2158 in the\nliterature is our work based on one star in the cluster (Jacobson et al. 2009). As we've already compared our\nresults to this work, we turn briefly to other photometric and/or low resolution spectroscopic studies. Janes (1979)\nfound [Fe/H] = \u22120.64\u00b10.24 based on DDO photometry; Twarog et al. (1997) found [Fe/H] = \u22120.238\u00b10.064 (s.d.)\nbased on a recalibration of Janes's metallicity scale. From Washington photometry of stars in the field, Geisler\n(1987) found [A/H] = \u22120.88\u00b10.10 or \u22120.30\u00b10.15 assuming E(B\u2212V) = 0.40 or 0.55, respectively. Based on\nlow-resolution spectroscopy of seven stars, Friel et al. (2002) found [Fe/H] = \u22120.29\u00b10.09. Our metallicity of\n[Fe/H] = \u22120.28\u00b10.05 is in excellent agreement with this value.\n\u2022 NGC 2194: NGC 2194 is another cluster for which only photometric abundances can be found in the literature.\nSanner et al. (2000) found solar metallicity isochrones provided the best match to the observed cluster CMD,\n\n\f32\n\nJacobson, Pilachowski & Friel\nin agreement with our determined [Fe/H] = \u22120.08\u00b10.08 for this cluster. However, Piatti et al. (2003) found\n[Fe/H] = \u22120.27\u00b10.03 based on Washington photometry. Some of this difference may be explained by their\nchoice of reddening to the cluster: they found E(V\u2212I) = 0.75, which corresponds to E(B\u2212V) = 0.55. This\nis much larger than the value found in our study. Like NGC 2158, uncertainties in the (large) extinction\nto this cluster can adversely effect the photometric temperature scale we adopted to determine the cluster\nabundances. However, a larger reddening would result in hotter temperatures, which would increase stellar\nmetallicity. Therefore, selection of a larger reddening value would not bring our results into better agreement\nwith Piatti et al. (2003). The reddening to this cluster should be better constrained, or else stellar temperatures\nshould be spectroscopically-determined in order to untangle reddening and metallicity of this cluster.\n\u2022 NGC 2355: A handful of photometry studies of NGC 2355 exist in the literature. Metallicity estimates range\nfrom [Fe/H] = +0.13 (Kaluzny & Mazur 1991) to [Fe/H] = \u22120.32 (Ann et al. 1999). Soubiran et al. (2000)\ndetermined a mean cluster metallicity by comparison of low S/N, high resolution ELODIE spectra of cluster\nmembers to a library of stars with well-defined parameters (the TGMET library; Soubiran et al. 1998). They\nfound a weighted mean [Fe/H] = \u22120.07\u00b10.11 based on 17 stars, which is in excellent agreement with our value\nof [Fe/H] = \u22120.08\u00b10.08.\n\u2022 NGC 2420: At least three high resolution spectroscopic studies of NGC 2420 have been performed previously.\nSmith & Suntzeff (1987) found [Fe/H] \u223c \u22120.45\u00b10.08 (their analysis was relative to a Hyades giant star rather\nthan the Sun). Based on high resolution Lick spectra of three stars, Bosler (2004) found an average [Fe/H] =\n\u22120.33\u00b10.19. Our analysis of these same spectra found the same result (Jacobson et al. 2009). Most recently,\nPancino et al. (2010) found [Fe/H] = \u22120.05\u00b10.10 (s.d.) based on spectra of three evolved stars. Our value,\n[Fe/H] = \u22120.20\u00b10.06 lies in between all these values, most closely agreeing with that of Bosler (2004). For the\nother elements, our [X/Fe] ratios for Ca, Ti and Ni agree with those of Smith & Suntzeff (1987) within 0.15 dex,\nwhich is decent considering the lower resolution and even smaller wavelength range of their spectra compared to\nours. Compared to the results of Pancino et al. (2010), our values for [O/Fe], [Ca/Fe], [Si/Fe] and [Na/Fe] differ\nby \u223c0.2 dex, with our values being larger for all but oxygen. Abundance ratios for Mg, Ti and Ni agree within\n0.03 dex.\n\u2022 NGC 2425: Photometric metallicities for NGC 2425 have been determined by Moitinho et al. (2006) and\nPietrukowicz et al. (2006). Based on fits of theoretical isochrones to optical CMD's, Moitinho et al. found solar\nmetallicity, while Pietrukowicz et al. found good matches using both solar metallicity isochrones and isochrones\nwith Z = 0.008. Our value of [Fe/H] = \u22120.15\u00b10.09 is in good agreement with these results.\n\u2022 NGC 7789: Tautvai\u0161ien\u0117 et al. (2005) carried out a detailed abundance study of 9 evolved stars in NGC 7789.\nThey found [Fe/H] = \u22120.04\u00b10.05, which is in good agreement with our value of [Fe/H] = +0.02\u00b10.04. Abundances of non-Fe elements all agree within 0.11 dex, save for Si and O (our values are 0.15-0.2 dex larger). Pancino\net al. (2010) determined abundances for three giants in NGC 7789, and their determined mean metallicity is\nalso in excellent agreement with our value: [Fe/H] = +0.04\u00b10.10. [X/Fe] ratios agree less well, with differences\nbetween our and their values for Ca, Mg, Na and Si differing by \u223c0.15 dex or more. Our abundance ratios tend\nto be larger for all elements in common save for Mg and O.\n\n\fCluster\nM67\nN188\nN1245\nN1817\nN2158\nN2194\nN2355\nN2420\nN2425\nN7789\n\n#
