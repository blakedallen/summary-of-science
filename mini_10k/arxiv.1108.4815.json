The recently discovered KIs CeM2 Al10 (M = Os, Ru), which crystallize in\nan orthorhombic YbFe2 Al10 -type crystal structure (space\n\nFIG. 1:\n(Color online) Crystal structure of CeM2 Al10\n(M =Fe, Ru, Os). Eight unit cells marked by lines are depicted.\n\ngroup Cmcm, No. 63CFig. 1),3 however, show an anomalous antiferromagnetic phase transition at rather high T0\ntemperatures (28.7 K for M = Os, 27.3 K for Ru), which\nare lower than the Kondo temperatures (TK \u223c100 K for\nOs, 60 K for Ru).4\u20136 Recent studies using neutron diffraction and \u03bcSR have revealed that the magnetic structure\nhas a propagation vector of q = (0, 1, 0) and collinear antiferromagnetic moments orienting along the c axis.7\u201311\nSince the Ce\u2013Ce distance is longer than 5 \u00c5and Gdbased counterparts of GdRu2 Al10 and GdOs2 Al10 have a\nlower N\u00e9el temperature TN , at which the phase transition\ncan be solely attributed to the Ruderman-Kittel-KasuyaYoshida (RKKY) interaction, the RKKY interaction is\nnot believed to be the origin of the phase transition at\nT0 .5,12 The origin of the magnetic ordering, therefore,\nremains to be addressed.\nSo far, we have investigated the temperature dependence of the electronic structure of CeOs2 Al10 along the\nthree principal axes using the optical conductivity [\u03c3(\u03c9)]\nspectra.13 As a result, it has been found that energy\ngaps along the a and c axes open at temperatures higher\nthan T0 and that the gap sizes monotonically increase on\ncooling. Because the \u03c3(\u03c9) spectra in the ac plane are\nconsistent with the \u03c3(\u03c9) spectra of conventional KIs reported previously, the electronic structure in the ac plane\ncan be regarded as that of a KI. Along the b axis, however, an energy gap is suddenly formed at T0 . Since the\nshape of the energy gap along the b axis is similar to\nthat of charge-density wave (CDW)/spin-density wave\n(SDW) compounds reported previously, the origin has\nbeen attributed to band nesting due to charge instability. The change in the \u03c3(\u03c9) spectrum begins at a slightly\n\n\f2\nhigher temperature than T0 , and the energy gap structure\nclearly appears below T0 . Based on these observations,\nwe proposed that a change in electronic structure due to\nCDW instability induces the antiferromagnetic ordering\nat T0 .\nIn another KI, CeFe2 Al10 , with no magnetic ordering, the Kondo effect appears anisotropically.14,15 The\nelectronic structure along the b axis is different from\nthe isotropic electronic structure in the ac plane.16 The\nKondo temperature TK can be evaluated using the\ntemperature-dependent \u03c3(\u03c9) spectra and the temperature of maximum electrical resistivity Tmax . Thus, the\nevaluated intensity of the Kondo effect along the b axis\nis weaker than that in the ac plane.\nIn this paper, we focus on the relationship between\nthe anisotropic Kondo effect and the anomalous magnetic ordering at T0 . We show the anisotropic \u03c3(\u03c9) spectra of CeRu2 Al10 , to clarify the anisotropic electronic\nstructure. In CeOs2 Al10 , the peak structure at a photon energy ~\u03c9 of \u223c20 meV appears below 38 K, which\nis the same temperature of maximum magnetic susceptibility \u03c7(T ). The \u03c3(\u03c9) spectrum of CeRu2 Al10 also has a\nshoulder structure at ~\u03c9 \u223c20 meV, as does CeOs2 Al10 .\nThe shoulder appears at 30 K, which agrees with the\ntemperature of maximum \u03c7(T ). The temperature dependence of the intensity obeys the square of the gap\nfunction \u2206(T )2 , which is consistent with the BCS theory\nas in the case of CeOs2 Al10 . This fact suggests that the\nenergy gap along the b axis originates from the pairing\nof conduction electrons, namely charge instability or the\nCDW state, and that this in turn induces the magnetic\nordering. We point out that the creation of the CDW\nstate is strongly related to the c-f hybridization intensity.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL AND CALCULATION\nPROCEDURE\n\nSingle-crystalline CeM2 Al10 s (M =Fe, Ru, Os) were\nsynthesized by the Al-flux method17 and the surfaces\nwere well-polished using 0.3 \u03bcm grain-size Al2 O3 lapping film sheets for the optical reflectivity [R(\u03c9)] measurements. Near-normal incident polarized R(\u03c9) spectra were acquired in a very wide photon-energy region of\n2 meV \u2013 30 eV to ensure accurate Kramers-Kronig analysis (KKA). Martin-Puplett and Michelson type rapidscan Fourier spectrometers (JASCO Co. Ltd., FARIS-1\nand FTIR610) were used at the photon energy ~\u03c9 regions of 2 \u2013 30 meV and 5 meV \u2013 1.5 eV, respectively,\nwith a specially designed feed-back positioning system to\nmaintain the overall uncertainty level less than \u00b10.5 %\nin the T range of 10 \u2013 300 K.18 To obtain the absolute\nR(\u03c9) values, the samples were evaporated in-situ with\ngold, whose spectrum was then measured as a reference.\nAt T = 300 K, R(\u03c9) was measured for energies 1.2\u201330 eV\nby using synchrotron radiation.19 In order to obtain \u03c3(\u03c9)\nvia KKA of R(\u03c9), the spectra were extrapolated below\n\n2 meV with a Hagen-Rubens function, and above 30 eV\nwith a free-electron approximation R(\u03c9) \u221d \u03c9 \u22124 .20\nTo evaluate the mean valence of Ce ion in CeM2 Al10 ,\nan X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) experiment\nwas performed on the Ce 3d core levels using an Mg\nK\u03b1 X-ray source (h\u03bd=1253.6 eV) and a 100 mm-radius\nhemispherical photoelectron analyzer (VG Scienta SES100). The base pressure of the chamber was less than\n2 \u00d7 10\u22128 Pa. The sample temperature and total energy\nresolution were set at approximately 10 K and 0.6 eV, respectively. Clean sample surfaces were prepared inside an\nultra high-vacuum chamber by scraping with a diamond\nfiller. After cleaning, the oxygen and carbon contaminations were checked by monitoring the intensity of the\nO 1s and C 1s photoemission peaks maintained within\nthe noise level during the measurement.\nLocal-density approximation (LDA) band structure\ncalculation was performed by the full potential linearized\naugmented plane wave plus local orbital (LAPW+lo)\nmethod including spin-orbit interaction (SOI) implemented in the Wien2k code.21 The lattice parameters\nreported in the literature3 were used for the calculation.\nRMT Kmax (the smallest MT radius multiplied by the\nmaximum k value in the expansion of plane waves in the\nbasis set), which determines the accuracy of the basis set\nused, was set at 7.0. The total k number in a Brillouin\nzone was sampled with 10 000 k-points. Note that the\nLDA band calculation produces a metallic band structure, which is not consistent with the experimental KI\ncharacter. However, since the purpose of this study was\nto investigate the c-f hybridization intensity as well as\nthe mean valence number from first-principle band calculation, we used the metallic band structure derived from\nthe LDA calculation.\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nA.\n\nAnisotropic \u03c3(\u03c9) of CeRu2 Al10\n\nThe obtained R(\u03c9) spectra of CeRu2 Al10 along the a\naxis (Eka), b axis (Ekb), and c axis (Ekc) are shown in\nFig. 2. As can be seen in the inset, the R(\u03c9) spectra\nmonotonically decrease up to ~\u03c9 \u223c 10 eV, because the\nconduction band of aluminium expands to about 10 eV\nbelow EF as shown in the band calculation in Fig. 6(b).\nIn the middle-infrared region from 100 to 500 meV, there\nare small shoulder structures. This shape is not a characteristic double-peak structure with energy splitting of\n250 meV, which originates from optical excitation from\nthe occupied state at EF to the unoccupied Ce 4f state\nwith spin-orbit splitting usually seen in itinerant Ce compounds.22 This indicates that the hybridization of the\nCe 4f state with other states is not so large.\nLet us focus on the spectra below 100 meV. In the\nrange of 10\u201330 meV at 10 K, there are sharp peaks due\nto optical phonons: three sharp peaks in Eka, three small\npeaks in Ekb, and five peaks in Ekc. Except for these\n\n\f3\npeaks, the R(\u03c9) spectra for all principal axes at 300 K\nare Drude-like spectra that increase to unity with decreasing photon energy, indicating a metallic character.\nBelow 80 K, the value of R(\u03c9) below 150 meV rapidly\ndecreases on cooling, and eventually, other metallic R(\u03c9)\nspectra appear along all axes near the lowest accessible\nphoton energy of 2 meV. This indicates that the normalmetallic state changes to the low-carrier metallic state on\ncooling. This result is consistent with the temperature\ndependence of electrical resistivity.5\nThe temperature-dependent \u03c3(\u03c9) spectra derived from\nKKA of the R(\u03c9) spectra in Fig. 2 are shown in Fig. 3.\nThe \u03c3(\u03c9) spectra for all principal axes at 300 K monotonically increase with decreasing photon energy, again\nindicating a metallic character. A common feature of\nall of the principal axes is that the \u03c3(\u03c9) intensity below ~\u03c9 = 60 meV decreases on cooling, and at 80 K, a\nbroad shoulder structure appears at about 35 meV, which\nsuggests the existence of an energy gap due to strong hybridization in a similar manner to other KIs.23\u201326\nIn Eka and Ekc, gentle shoulder structures at about\n35 meV gradually evolve below 80 K and energy gaps appear at the lower energy side of the peak as the temperature decreases to 10 K. Unlike in Ekb, however, neither\n\nthe gap shape nor the energy change with temperature\n(except for the reduction in thermal broadening). This\nimplies that the intensity below the energy gap does not\ntransfer only to the region immediately above the energy gap, but to a wide energy range. This temperaturedependent gap structure is consistent with that of other\nKIs reported previously;23\u201326 namely, the temperaturedependent c-f hybridization gap. Therefore, the electronic structures in Eka and Ekc are similar to those of\nconventional KIs.\nOn the other hand, in Ekb, another shoulder structure\nevolves at 20 meV below 20 K, which is similar to that of\nCeOs2 Al10 .13 This suggests the same origin of the shoulder structure in the two systems. The shoulder structure\nemerges below T \u223c 80 K, developing at 35 meV due to\nthe c-f hybridization gap. This characteristic is also consistent with that of CeOs2 Al10 .\nBelow 40 K, the tails of a Drude structure appear at\naround 5 meV in all axes with the shape differing from\nthe spectral shape above 80 K, which is close to the\nTK of 60 K. According to the electrical resistivity data,\nthe direct-current conductivity is about 1000 \u03a9\u22121 cm\u22121\nor higher in all of the axes. As a result, very narrow\nDrude peaks suggesting quasi-particles with a low scattering rate can be expected to appear below 5 meV. This\nimplies that the character of the carriers changes from a\nnormal metal to quasi-particles on cooling through TK ,\nas in the case of CeFe2 Al10 and other heavy fermion materials.16,27\n\nE // a\n\nE // b\n\nE // c\n\nT =\n300 K\n\n200 K\n\n130 K\n\n80 K\n\n40 K\n\n20 K\n\n3\n\n10 K\n\n(\n\n) (10\n\n3\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\ncm )\n\n6\n\n0\n0\n\n20 40 60 0\n\n20 40 60 0\n\n20 40 60\n\n(meV)\n\nFIG. 2:\n(Color online) Low-energy portion of the\ntemperature-dependent polarized reflectivity [R(\u03c9)] spectra\nof CeRu2 Al10 along the three principal axes.

In Fig. 4, shoulder structures exist as indicated by\nthe arrows at 35, 45, and 55 meV for M = Ru, Os, and\nFe, respectively. In CeFe2 Al10 , the shoulder structure is\nascribed to the optical transition between the bonding\nand antibonding states of the c-f hybridization band.16\nAccording to the periodic Anderson model that describes\nthe c-f hybridization band, the minimum energy difference between the bonding and antibonding bands at the\nsame wave vector k point is roughly double the effective hybridization energy \u1e7c .28 Because the energy of the\nshoulder structure is related to \u1e7c , the effective c-f hybridization energy increases as M changes from Ru to Os\nand Fe.\nThe mean valence of Ce ion can be evaluated from the\nCe 3d core level photoemission spectra (Ce 3d XPS).30\nFigure 5 shows the normalized Ce 3d XPS spectra of\nCeM2 Al10 at 10 K. However, conventional fitting of the\nf 0 , f 1 , and f 2 final states is difficult in this case, because a large plasmon peak of aluminium exists at about\n16 eV higher on the binding energy side of the main\npeaks of 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 . The hybridization intensities of CeFe2 Al10 and CeOs2 Al10 were therefore estimated by subtraction; i.e., [IFe \u2212 IRu ] and [IOs \u2212 IRu ],\n\nrespectively. These differential spectra show that the\nf 1 peak intensity decreases and f 0 peak intensity increases in the order of Ru\u2192Os\u2192Fe. The mean valence nf can be roughly obtained by the function nf =\n1 \u2212 I(f 0 )/[I(f 0 ) + I(f 1 ) + 2 \u00d7 I(f 2 )], where I(f n ) is\nthe integrated intensity of an f n peak.29 The value of\nnf decreases from 1.0 as M changes from Ru to Os and\nFe. This suggests that the c-f hybridization intensity\nincreases in the order of Ru\u2192Os\u2192Fe. This trend is consistent with the order of the energy gap size in these materials observed by \u03c3(\u03c9) spectra. Note that the spectral\nfeature of CeOs2 Al10 did not change with temperature\nacross T0 . This implies that the mean valence does not\nchange at T0 .\nThe Ce 3d XPS result was confirmed by LDA band calculation. The total density of states (DOS) and partial\nDOS of the Ce f and M d states derived from the band\ncalculation with SOI are shown in Fig. 6(a). The total\nDOS of all CeM2 Al10 s in the wide energy range, shown\nin Fig. 6(b), indicates that the structure near EF is overlaid on a large Al 3s-3p conduction band with a bottom\nof about \u221210 eV. The double sharp peak structure immediately above EF indicates the Ce 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 states\nwith SOI. The M d states of all materials that expand\nbelow EF differ from one another.

The energies of the f 0 , f 1 , and\nf 2 final states of the 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 core levels are marked\nby vertical lines. The subtraction spectra obtained by subtracting CeRu2 Al10 from CeFe2 Al10 and CeOs2 Al10 are also\nplotted as IFe \u2212 IRu and IOs \u2212 IRu , respectively.\n\n\f5\nRu 4d state of CeRu2 Al10 and the Os 5d state widely expand in the valence band. This suggests that hybridization of the Fe 3d state to the Ce 4f state is stronger than\nthat in the case of Ru 4d and Os 5d. The shallowest\npeak in the occupied state of CeOs2 Al10 is slightly closer\nthan that of CeRu2 Al10 , as indicated by the arrows in\nthe figure. The peak originates from the M d state; i.e.,\nthe Os 5d state is located closer to EF than the Ru 4d\nstate due to the strong SOI. A similar trend has been\nobserved in alkaline-earth-filled skutterudites AM4 Sb12\n(A = alkaline-earth, M = Fe, Ru, Os).32\nTo compare the c-f hybridization intensity among the\nthree compounds, the mean 4f electron number nf was\nevaluated from the band calculation. As a result, nf was\nfound to be 0.943 in CeRu2 Al10 (most localized), 0.942\nin CeOs2 Al10 , and 0.937 in CeFe2 Al10 (most itinerant).\nThis variation is consistent with the order of the energy\ngap size in the \u03c3(\u03c9) spectra and the results obtained for\nthe Ce 3d XPS spectra, in which the c-f hybridization intensity increases in the order of Ru\u2192Os\u2192Fe. Therefore,\n\n(a)\n40\n\nCeOs Al\n2\n\n10\n\n20\n\n-1\n\nDOS (eV )\n\n0\n40\n\nCeRu Al\n2\n\n10\n\n20\n\n0\n40\n\nCeFe Al\n2\n\n10\n\nthe difference in the c-f hybridization intensity originates\nfrom the different M d states.\nNote that the band calculation showed no energy gap\nstructure, which is inconsistent with the observed \u03c3(\u03c9)\nspectra. In conventional KIs, a semiconducting or semimetallic band structure appears in the band calculation,\nalthough the energy scale is renormalized by a strong\nmany-body interaction. However, neither a gap nor a\nsemi-metallic structure appears even in CeFe2 Al10 , which\ncan be regarded as a conventional KI. The reason for this\ninconsistency is not yet clear, but the evolution of the\nenergy gap might be assisted by another mechanism.\nAll of the results of the edge in the \u03c3(\u03c9) spectra,\nthe Ce 3d XPS, and the band calculation indicate that\nthe c-f hybridization intensity increases in the order of\nCeRu2 Al10 \u2192 CeOs2 Al10 \u2192 CeFe2 Al10 . This result is\nconsistent with the reported pressure-dependent electrical resistivity \u03c1(T ).5 Applying pressure to cerium compounds is equivalent to increasing the c-f hybridization\nintensity. When pressure is applied to CeRu2 Al10 , \u03c1(T )\nbecomes similar to that of CeOs2 Al10 at about 1.5 GPa,\nand above 4 GPa, T0 disappears and \u03c1(T ) becomes similar to that of CeFe2 Al10 . In the case of CeOs2 Al10 , T0\nalso disappears above 2 GPa and \u03c1(T ) changes to that of\nCeFe2 Al10 .31\nAt ambient temperature and pressure, the volumes of\nthe unit cell are 0.836 nm3 for CeFe2 Al10 , 0.857 nm3 for\nCeRu2 Al10 , and 0.858 nm3 for CeOs2 Al10 .5 This order is\nthe same as the order of ionic radii of Fe, Ru, and Os.\nThe order of the c-f hybridization intensities, however,\nis revised between CeRu2 Al10 and CeOs2 Al10 . This is\nconsidered to originate from the fact that the SOI of 5d\nelectron is larger than that of 4d. The Os 5d5/2 level is\ntherefore located close to EF , and is readily mixed to the\nCe 4f state. As a result, the c-f hybridization intensity\nof CeOs2 Al10 becomes stronger than that of CeRu2 Al10 .\n\n20\n\n0\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nEnergy (eV)\n\n(b)\nCeOs Al\n\n-1\n\nDOS (eV )\n\n100\n\n2\n\n10\n\nCeRu Al\n2\n\n50\n\n10\n\nCeFe Al\n2\n\n10\n\n0\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\nEnergy (eV)\n\nFIG. 6: (Color online) (a) Total density of states (DOS) of\nCeM2 Al10 (M = Os, Ru, Fe) and partial DOS of the Ce f\n(dashed lines) and M d (dotted lines) states near the Fermi\nlevel at an energy of 0 eV.

To trace\nthe temperature dependence in detail, the \u03c3(\u03c9) spectra\nwere measured below 40 K in steps of 2 K. Figure 7(a)\nshows selected \u03c3(\u03c9) spectra in Ekb at temperatures from\n32 to 10 K. On cooling below 28 K, the 20 meV peak\nextends above the background originating from the c-f\nhybridization gap and optical phonon peaks appear at\naround 30 meV. Because the shape of the c-f hybridization gap in Eka and Ekc is almost linear with the energy,\nthe background in Ekb was assumed to be linear between\n8 and 35 meV. The 20 meV peak intensity was then extracted by subtracting the background and the phonon\npeaks. The obtained 20 meV peak intensities are shown\nas the cross-hatched areas in Fig. 7(a). To evaluate the\ntotal intensity, the effective electron number (Nef f ) was\n\n\f6\ncalculated by using the function,\nZ\n4m0 \u221e\n\u03c3(~\u03c9)d~\u03c9,\nNef f = 2 2\nh e 0\nwhere h is the Planck constant, e the elementary charge,\nand m0 the electron rest mass.20\nThe obtained Nef f s for CeRu2 Al10 and CeOs2 Al10\nare plotted as a function of temperature in Fig. 7(b).\nThe solid curves show the square of the orderparameter \u2206(T ) given by the BCS theory, which is\nphenomenologically\napproximated as \u2206(T ) = \u22060 \u00d7\n\u221a\ntanh [1.74 \u00d7 (Tc /T \u2212 1)].33 All data points fall on the\nBCS function. Consequently, it is strongly suggested\nthat the charge carriers undergo pairing; i.e., charge instability or a CDW/SDW is formed along the b axis.\nThis finding is essentially the same that obtained in\n(a)\n\nT = 32 K\n28 K\n\n(\n\n) (10\n\n3\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\ncm )\n\n24 K\n\n20 K\n\n4\n\n10 K\n\n2\n0\n\nCeRu Al\n\nE // b\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n2\n\n10\n\n60\n\n(meV)\n\n4\n\n(10\n\n19\n\n-3\n\ncm )\n\n(b)\n\nCeOs Al\n2\n\n2\n\n(\n\nT)\n\n10\n\n2\n\nCeRu Al\n2\n\n10\n\nNeff\n\n0\n\nT T\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\nT (K)\n\n0\n\n30\n\n40\n\nFIG. 7: (Color online) (a) Temperature-dependent optical\nconductivity [\u03c3(\u03c9)] spectrum of CeRu2 Al10 in Ekb.

(b) Effective electron number (Nef f ) of the shoulder structures shown\nin (a) plotted as a function of temperature. The Nef f of\nCeOs2 Al10 is also plotted. The solid lines indicate the square\nof the order parameter \u2206(T ) of the BCS theory. The critical temperature T \u2217 of \u2206(T ) was set at 32 K for CeRu2 Al10\nand 37.5 K for CeOs2 Al10 . The vertical dotted-dashed lines\nindicate the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature T0 of\nCeRu2 Al10 and CeOs2 Al10 .\n\nprevious studies of CDW and SDW transitions in 1T TiSe2 34 , (TMTSF)2 PF6 ,35 and others. The superlattice\nreflections of CeOs2 Al10 observed along the [01\u03041] direction by electron diffraction are also consistent with the\nCDW/SDW scenario.17\nBy the fitting of \u2206(T )2 with the BCS function, the\ncritical temperature T \u2217 of CeRu2 Al10 was determined\nto be 32 K and that of CeOs2 Al10 to be 37.5 K. The\nvalue of Tc is certainly higher than that of T0 , but\nclose to the temperature of maximum \u03c7(T ) (\u223c30 K\nfor CeRu2 Al10 , \u223c40 K for CeOs2 Al10 ).5,17 This implies\nthat the 20 meV peak is related to the mechanism\nthat determines the maximum of \u03c7(T ). For example,\nin quasi one-dimensional conductors such as (TaSe4 )2 I,\nK0.3 MoO3 , TaSe4 I0.5 , and TaS3 , CDW fluctuation occurs when the mean-field transition temperature TcMF\nexceeds the CDW transition temperature Tc .36 \u03c7(T ) as\nwell as the electronic structure near EF can be explained\nby CDW fluctuation based on the mean-field theory.37 At\nTcMF , the magnetic spin susceptibility begins to decrease\nfrom a constant Pauli spin susceptibility at higher temperatures, and the DOS at EF begins to decrease while\nthe intensity shifts to the gap edge due to band nesting. If\nT \u2217 and T0 of CeRu2 Al10 and CeOs2 Al10 are regarded as\nTcMF and Tc , respectively, the spectral change and the\ntemperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility\nof there materials can be explained by CDW fluctuation\nbased on the mean-field theory. This result strongly suggests that the energy gaps along the b axis of CeRu2 Al10\nand CeOs2 Al10 originate from CDW formation.\nIn CeFe2 Al10 , \u03c7(T ) also reaches its maximum at\naround 70 K, although there is no magnetic transition.\nThe \u03c3(\u03c9) spectra have no peak structure below the c-f\nhybridization gap energy of 55 meV. Therefore, the maximum of \u03c7(T ) is considered to originate from the exponential decrease in the carrier density, as found in other\nKIs.1,2\nTo summarize the results of the present work and our\nprevious studies,13,16 CeOs2 Al10 and CeRu2 Al10 with a\nCDW electronic structure along the b axis show magnetic\nordering at T0 , whereas CeFe2 Al10 without such an electronic structure does not have magnetic ordering. This\nrelation strongly suggests that the formation of the CDW\nalong the b axis triggers the magnetic ordering. This conjecture is consistent with the pressure-dependent electrical resistivity data of CeOs2 Al10 .31 Under pressure, T0\nsuddenly disappears at the critical pressure (\u223c2.5 GPa)\nat which the evaluated activation energy (\u2206L ) becomes\n0 and the energy gap is closed. The energy gap 2\u2206L at\nambient pressure is about 3 meV, which is similar to the\nonset energy (\u223c5 meV) of the energy gap observed in\nthe \u03c3(\u03c9, T ) spectrum at 10 K devided by that at 40 K.13\nThe magnetic ordering disappears above T0 , at which\nthe onset energy becomes 0 and the energy gap is closed.\nTherefore, both the results of the \u03c3(\u03c9) spectrum and the\npressure-dependent electrical resistivity indicate that the\nenergy gap formation above T0 induces the magnetic ordering.\n\n\f7\nAs discussed above, the c-f hybridization intensity\nincreases in the order of CeRu2 Al10 \u2192 CeOs2 Al10 \u2192\nCeFe2 Al10 . The character of all three systems in the\nac plane is that of a KI because of the stronger c-f\nhybridization intensity in the ac plane than along the\nb axis. Along the b axis, CeFe2 Al10 , which has the\nstrongest hybridization intensity, behaves as a KI, but\nthe electronic states of CeRu2 Al10 and CeOs2 Al10 , which\nhave weak hybridization intensity, become the CDW\nstate. This suggests that the CDW transition originates\nfrom one-dimensional weak c-f hybridization combined\nwith two-dimensional strong hybridization. In this sense,\nCeRu2 Al10 and CeOs2 Al10 are in a new class of KIs in\nwhich such strong anisotropy causes magnetic ordering\nat a high transition temperature.\n\nthe a and c axes, the spectral weight below 35 meV\nmonotonically decreased on cooling, indicating a Kondo\nsemiconducting character. The temperature variation of\nthe energy gap compared with those of CeFe2 Al10 and\nCeOs2 Al10 , and their Ce 3d XPS results, suggest that\nthe intensity of c-f hybridization between the conduction and 4f electrons increases in the order of CeRu2 Al10 ,\nCeOs2 Al10 , and CeFe2 Al10 . In contrast, a CDW energy\ngap opened below 32 K and 37.5 K along the b axis in\nCeRu2 Al10 and CeOs2 Al10 , respectively. We conclude\nthat the antiferromagnetic ordering at T0 in CeRu2 Al10\nand CeOs2 Al10 is assisted by CDW formation along the\nb axis.\nAcknowledgments\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe electronic structure of CeRu2 Al10 was investigated\nusing temperature-dependent polarized optical conductivity [\u03c3(\u03c9)] spectra combined with Ce 3d X-ray photoemission spectra (XPS) and band calculation.
