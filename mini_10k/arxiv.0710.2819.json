Usually, one successfully uses them to explain anomalous scaling behavior of some quantities of interest. However, when finer\ndetails of anomalous transport processes come to a question, such as aging for example, an investigator, equipped\nwith FDE but with the logic of classical diffusion, often\nfails to describe it correctly. An intrinsically asymptotic\ncharacter of FDE is more crucial than in classical diffusion, since it involves nonlocal time/space operators.\nTherefore, some particular tasks require the knowledge\nof the dynamics underlying the FDE and not only their\nfinal form. In many cases, such dynamics can be modeled\nby continuous time random walks (CTRW) [1, 2, 3]. It\nallows to follow all derivation steps in detail and obtain\nuseful analytical results. In the present work, we will also\nuse CTRW as a basis model.\nThe problem of aging is one of the fundamental questions relevant in different fields of physics. The word\n\"aging\" essentially denotes a whatever pronounced timeinhomogeneous behavior of a physical system. It applies\nto all situations when the result of a measurement depends explicitely on the time when this measurement was\nperformed (i.e. what is the time elapsed between the instant when the system was prepared and the instant when\nthe measurement started). Aging and memory effects\nare intrinsic features of glasses [4, 5, 6], colloidal systems\n[7, 8], granular materials [9, 10], diffusion processes in\nrandom environment [11], etc. Measurement setups and\nphysical reasons for such a time-inhomogeneous behavior\ncan be quite different, e.g. the physical system can age\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: vasily.zaburdaev@tu-berlin.de\naddress: igor.sokolov@physik.hu-berlin.de\n\ndue to some slow internal processes or due to external impacts. In what follows we consider the CTRW model to\ndemonstrate the nature and appearance of aging effects\nwhich, in this case, can be completely understood.\nDifferent aspects of aging in continuous time random\nwalks were addressed e.g. in [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. The\nproblem discussed in the present article is related to the\none of Ref. [14], where the author considered the aging in\nthe subdiffusion process generated by a deterministic dynamical system. We generalize the results of the Ref. [14]\nand explicitly express the generalized diffusion equation\ndescribing aging CTRW by using a single memory kernel.\nFurther, we consider the situation of random walks with\ntruncated power-law waiting time distributions, which\nleads to equilibration. We show that the final form of\nthe corresponding diffusion equation depends on whether\nthis waiting time distribution possesses the second moment or not. In the latter case, the convergence of the\nprobability density function (PDF) for the concentration\nof particles to a Gaussian is very slow.\nWe moreover stress that the results obtained in the\nRef. [14] and generalized in the present work are pertinent to a very specific variant of the aging problem. To\ndemonstrate this, we discuss a seemingly similar (but in\nreality very different) approach to aging. Although both\napproaches are intimately related, they lead to different\npredictions for the evolution of the system. We show\nthat these approaches also correspond to different experimental situations and discuss their applicability and\nlimitations.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In the Section 2 we formulate the aging problem corresponding to\nthe setup of Ref. [14], introduce the generalized master\nequation (GME) approach, and derive the corresponding\nfractional diffusion equation for aging walks. We analyze\nthe asymptotic form of the aging diffusion equation and\nexpress it through a single memory kernel. In the Section 3, we apply these results to the equilibrated random\nwalks. We derive the corresponding transport equations\nwith distributed order fractional time derivative and dis-\n\n\f2\ncuss particularly interesting behavior of the moments of\nthe density distribution. In the Section 4, we discuss another approach to aging, the relevant experimental situation, and the corresponding results. The last section\n(Section 5) is reserved for conclusions.\n\n2.\n\ncase when the whole profile n(x, t = t1 ) is known, the\nconcentration profile nA (x, t = t2 ) at t2 is given by a\nconvolution of the former one and n(x, t1 , t) .\n\nMASTER EQUATION FOR AGING\nRANDOM WALKS\n2.1.\n\nGeneral considerations\n\nConsider a system of particles created at t0 = 0 . After the system was created, we let it evolve according\nto its internal dynamical laws during an interval of time\nt1 > 0 . The initial distribution of particles at preparation, n(x, 0) is unknown. At the time t1 we labeled\nsome particles and thus created a known probability distribution n(x, t1 ) of such marked particles (performed\na measurement). For example, we could irradiate our\nsystem with light and create excited states of atoms or\nmolecules of the interest inside the region of the order of\nthe light beam radius or its penetration depth. Equivalently, we may consider a single particle that has started\nat time t = 0 from an unknown location and at the time\nt1 , was detected at the point x1 and labeled. The quantity of interest is n(x, t2 ) , the density at a given instant\nof time t2 > t1 , which we assume to be experimentally\naccessible. Then the following question can be put: If\nwe only know the duration of the previous evolution, t1\n(called aging time), and the position of the particle at\nt = t1 , what can we say about the future evolution of\nthe particle's position? How precise can we predict the\nposition of this particle at the time t2 > t1 , and how\ndoes this prediction depend on t1 and t2 ? In the case\nof many labeled particles, the same questions apply to\nthe profile at t2 which can be obtained as a convolution of the concentration profile at t1 and the PDF of\nthe single-particle displacements. We note that the density of points in a configuration space of some system\ncan correspond not only to coordinates of some real particles but to whatever other coordinates characterizing\ne.g. temperature or magnetic field. In our explanation\nwe, however, confine ourselves to the picture of particles.\nThe problem of aging in this setup can be considered as\nthe \"intermediate-time initial condition\" problem: The\nsystem was created at t = 0 but the initial condition to\nthe corresponding transport equation is posed at a later\ninstant of time t = t1 . For normal, Markovian diffusion this does not change the overall form of the transport equation. In non-Markovian cases, especially in the\nones with long enough memory, it does, as we proceed to\nshow. This aging problem is schematically illustrated in\nthe Fig. 1. Assume that the density of labeled particles\nat t = t1 at point x = x1 is known. Starting from this\npoint the particles diffuse, and at t2 = t1 + t acquire\nsome distribution (not shown). By n(x, t1 , t) we denote\nour theoretical prediction for this distribution. In the\n\nFIG. 1: The first aging problem setup. The evolution starts\nat t = 0 from an unknown initial distribution. At t = t1\nthe particles with a profile n(x, t = t1 ) are labeled. At\nt2 = t1 + t for the diffusion from a single point we obtain\nthe probability density n(x, t1 , t) and for the full profile the\ndensity nA (x, t = t2 ) . The dashed line and the grayscale\nshadow in the (x, t) plane are used to guide the eye for the\ndiffusion from a single point.\n\nFor simplicity we start with the CTRW model on a\none-dimensional lattice; generalizations to the continuous\ncase and to higher dimensions are quite evident. Consider a discrete set of sites marked by an index i . By ni we\ndenote the occupation probability of each site (density of\nparticles). After a certain waiting time at the site i , a\nparticle can jump to the two neighboring sites i \u2212 1, i + 1\nwith equal probability 1/2 . The waiting time distribution at a site is governed by the probability density \u03c8(\u03c4 ) .\nThe properties of this function determine the regime of\nR\u221e\ndiffusion. If the mean waiting time, h\u03c4 i = \u03c4 \u03c8(\u03c4 )d\u03c4 , is\n0\n\nfinite, the resulting transport process will be a normal diffusion. However, even in this case some aging effects can\nstill emerge, with the only exception of the exponential\nwaiting time distribution [17]. If the mean waiting time\nis infinite, we are in the situation of anomalous subdiffusive behavior, where the aging effects are the strongest.\nIt is known that in the subdiffusive regime asymptotic\ntransport equations have a form of the fractional diffusion equation, where fractional differentiation appears in\nthe temporal part. It is easy to see that in the case of\nthe fractional time derivative, the solutions of the corresponding equation do not posses the semi-group property.\nThis is a strong indication that the choice of the starting\npoint or an intermediate initial condition may noticeably\naffect the following dynamics.\nTo consider this point in detail, we need to derive\nthe transport equation which adequately describes aging. Our approach is based on the generalized master\nequation and is similar to the phenomenological derivation of the diffusion or Fokker-Planck equations using a\ncombination of a continuity equation and the equation for\n\n\f3\ncurrents [18]. The continuity assumption contains essentially two balance conditions guaranteeing the probability conservation: a local one (giving the balance between\nthe probability gain and loss at one site) and the one for\ntransitions between the two sites (representing particle\nconservation during the jumps). A balance equation at\neach site reads\n\nwhere f (z)dz is the probability to make a jump within\nthe time interval between z and z + dz , so that f (z)\nis the time-dependent density of steps. This can be presented in the following form:\nf (z) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nfn (z).\n\n(6)\n\nn=0\n\n\u1e45i (t) = ji+ (t) \u2212 ji\u2212 (t),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ji\u2212 (t) is the loss current, i.e. the probability for\na particle to leave the site per unit time at time t , and\nji+ (t) is the gain current at a site.\nA particle arriving to the site i at time t comes either\nfrom the left or from the right. Probability conservation\nfor transitions between sites then reads\nji+ (t)\n\n1 \u2212\n1 \u2212\n(t) + ji+1\n(t).\n= ji\u22121\n2\n2\n\n1 \u2212\n1 \u2212\nji\u22121 (t) + ji+1\n(t) \u2212 ji\u2212 (t)\n2\n2\n\n(3)\n\nAccording to the waiting time distribution, the loss current at time t is connected to the gain current at the\nsite at all previous times: the particles which leave the\nsite i at the time t (making a step from i to one of its\nneighbors) either were at the same site i from the very\nbeginning, or came there at some later time 0 < \u03c4 < t .\nA probability density to make a step at time t when\narriving at \u03c4 is given by the waiting time distribution\n\u03c8(t \u2212 \u03c4 ) . Then for the loss current ji\u2212 (t) we can write:\nZ t\n\u2212\n(1)\nji (t) = \u03c8 (t, t1 )e\nni,0 +\n\u03c8(t \u2212 \u03c4 )ji+ (\u03c4 )d\u03c4. (4)\n0\n\nHowever, for the aging initial conditions the probability\nto make the first step after the measurement at t1 is different from \u03c8(\u03c4 ) . Here we postulated it to be independent of the spatial position i and denoted by \u03c8 (1) (\u03c4, t1 ) .\nWe also assumed that the system was created at the time\nt = 0 , and a measurement was performed at t = t1 .\nFrom here on we denote by t the time elapsed from t1\nand denote by n\nei,0 \u2261 n\nei (t1 ) the initial condition for the\nsystem's further evolution. By using Eqs.(2-3) we can\nrewrite (4) as:\nZ t\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2212\n(1)\nji (t) = \u03c8 (t, t1 )e\nni,0 +\n\u03c8(t \u2212 \u03c4 ) \u1e45i (\u03c4 ) + ji\u2212 (\u03c4 ) d\u03c4.\n0\n\n(5)\nNow we have to find the expression for the forward waiting time distribution of the first step \u03c8 (1) (\u03c4, t1 ) [19]. The\nforward waiting time \u03c4 is counted starting from the observation point. Let us assume that the jump preceding\nt1 (numbered j \u2212 1 ), took place at time tj\u22121 = z . The\nforward waiting time distribution \u03c8 (1) (\u03c4, t1 ) is\nZ t1\n(1)\nf (z)\u03c8(t1 \u2212 z + \u03c4 )dz,\n\u03c8 (\u03c4, t1 ) =\n0\n\nfs = 1 + \u03c8s + \u03c8s2 + ... =\n\n(2)\n\nBy combining (1) and (2) we get a continuity equation\n\u1e45i (t) =\n\nHere fn (t) is the probability density that it is exactly\nn -th jump that takes place at time t .

Thus, M (t) is the density of all\nsteps excluding the first one. Evidently, the asymptotic\nproperties of the functions M and f are the same.\nNow we concentrate on the temporal asymptotic behavior of the source term. By using Eqs. (8) and (11),\nfor the double Laplace transform of \u03a6(1) (t, t1 ) we can\nwrite:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n1\n\u03c8p\n1\n(1)\n\u03a6p,s =\n\u2212\n\u2212\n(13)\np \u2212 s 1 \u2212 \u03c8s\n1 \u2212 \u03c8p\ns(1 \u2212 \u03c8p )\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+ .\n=\np \u2212 s 1 \u2212 \u03c8s\n1 \u2212 \u03c8p\ns(1 \u2212 \u03c8p ) s\nIn order to understand the structure of the above expression we use one remarkable property of the Laplace transform. For any function h , such that its Laplace transform exists, the following property for double Laplace\ntransform holds [17]:\n[h(t + t1 )]p,s\n\nhp \u2212 hs\n=\n,\ns\u2212p\n\n(14)\n\nwhere s and p are Laplace space variables corresponding to t and t1 respectively. By using this fact we can\nrewrite the expression for \u03a6(1) (t, t1 ) (13) in time domain:\n\u03a6(1) (t, t1 ) = f (t + t1 ) \u2212 f (t) + \u03b4(t),\n\n(15)\n\nwhere f (t) is the density of steps given by the inverse\nLaplace transform of 1/(1 \u2212 \u03c8p ) . This one, as we have\nalready seen, is connected with the first memory kernel\nM (t) via M (t) = f (t) \u2212 \u03b4(t) , so that it can be rewritten\nin the form \u03a6(1) (t, t1 ) = M (t + t1 ) + \u03b4(t + t1 ) \u2212 M (t) .\nHowever, for whatever aged system ( t1 > 0 ) the delta\nfunction vanishes, so that the final result\n\u03a6(1) (t, t1 ) = M (t + t1 ) \u2212 M (t)\n\n(16)\n\nfollows. This is a new expression which connects the\nsource term with the memory kernel of the generalized\nmaster equation for aging continuous time random walks\n\nd\nni (t) =\n(17)\ndt\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ t\n1\n1\nd\nM (t \u2212 \u03c4 ) ni\u22121 (\u03c4 ) + ni+1 (\u03c4 ) \u2212 ni (\u03c4 ) d\u03c4\ndt 0\n2\n2\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n1\n+ [M (t + t1 ) \u2212 M (t)] ni\u22121 (t1 ) + ni+1 (t1 ) \u2212 ni (t1 ) ,\n2\n2\nIn the more general continuous case, when the jumps'\nlengths are no more discrete but rather distributed according to some probability density g(x) , Eq.(17) turns\nto an integral equation of the form:\nd\nn(x, t) =\n(18)\ndt\n+\u221e\nZ\nZ\nd t\nM (t \u2212 \u03c4 )\ng(y) [n(x \u2212 y, \u03c4 ) \u2212 n(x, \u03c4 )] dyd\u03c4\ndt 0\n\u2212\u221e\n\n+\u221e\nZ\n+ [M (t + t1 ) \u2212 M (t)]\ng(y) [n(x \u2212 y, t1 ) \u2212 n(x, t1 )] dy.\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThe discrete case, Eq.(17) corresponds to the choice\ng(x) = [\u03b4(x \u2212 a) + \u03b4(x + a)]/2 with a being the lattice spacing. The generalized master equations, Eq.(17)\nand Eq.(18), contain the standard random walk part represented by the first term and an additional term representing the memory on the initial conditions. This memory term is expressed through the same CTRW memory\nkernel as encountered in the first term on the right hand\nside and vanishes when either t1 = 0 , or \u03c8(\u03c4 ) is an\nexponential.\n2.3.\n\nAsymptotic form of the aging equation\n\nNow we would like to obtain the asymptotic form of the\nabove transport equation corresponding to large values\nof x and t (or respectively small k and p ). Assuming\nni (t) to change slowly enough as the function of the site\nnumber i one can change to the continuous description\nintroducing the density n(x, t) with x = ia . The difference operators in Eq.(17) can then be considered as a\ndiscrete approximation to a Laplacian, so that the corresponding master equations takes the form of generalized\ndiffusion equation with the additional memory term\nZ t\n\u2202\na2 \u2202\nn(x, t) =\nM (t \u2212 \u03c4 )\u2206n(x, \u03c4 )d\u03c4\n\u2202t\n2 \u2202t 0\na2\n+ [M (t + t1 ) \u2212 M (t)] \u2206n(x, 0) (19)\n2\nThe same form follows from the more general continuous form, Eq.(18), provided the jump length distribution g(x) has a finite second moment ( x2 < \u221e ). The\ncorresponding proof follows either the standard KramersMoyal procedure or can easily be obtained as the small- k\nexpansion in the Fourier space.\n\n\f5\nFor\nexponential\nwaiting\ntime\ndistribution\n\u03c8(t) = t\u22121\nexp(\u2212t/t\n)\nthe\nmemory\nkernel\nM\n(t) = 1/t0\n0\n0\nand the equation takes form of the ordinary diffusion\nequation\na2\n\u2202\n\u2206n(x, t)\nn(x, t) =\n\u2202t\n2t0\n\n(20)\n\nlacking the second memory term. The combination\nK = a2 /2t0 is the usual diffusion coefficient of the process. Another common choice of the waiting time distribution (determined by both, real practical situations and\nmathematical convenience) is a power law function, e.g.\n\u03c8(t) = \u03b3/t0 (1 + t/t0 )1+\u03b3 , with 0 < \u03b3 < 1 , where t0\nagain gives us the characteristic temporal scale of waiting times. The expansion of its Laplace transform for\na small p is: \u03c8p = 1 \u2212 \u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b3)t\u03b30 p\u03b3 + O(p) , and the\ncorresponding memory kernel M (t) is given by\nM (t) \u2243\n\n1\nt\u03b3\u22121\n,\n\u0393(\u03b3)t\u03b30 \u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b3)\n\n(21)\n\nin which we recognize an expression proportional to the\nintegral kernel of the fractional derivative. After substituting this expansion into (19) and some algebra we\nobtain:\n\u2202\nn(x, t) = K\u03b3 0 Dt1\u2212\u03b3 \u25b3n(x, t)\n(22)\n\u2202t\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n1\n1\n+K\u03b3\n\u2212 1\u2212\u03b3 \u25b3n(x, t1 ).\n1\u2212\u03b3\n\u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b3) (t + t1 )\nt\nwhere the generalized diffusion coefficient K\u03b3 stands for\nK\u03b3 = a2 /[2\u0393(\u03b3)t\u03b30 ] . We must note that the second memory term in Eq.(22) contains the Laplacian, whereas the\ncorresponding term in the result of Ref.[14] does not. The\nprobable reason for that is an insufficient number of terms\nretained in the asymptotic expansion in Ref.[14].\n3.\n\nhave enough time to equilibrate. The time lag between\nthe labeling particles at t = t1 and final measurement\nat t2 is however small enough to probe nonequilibrium\ndynamics. The general result for the aging problems can\nbe easily applied to this concrete example. The equilibrated case corresponds to the limit t1 \u2192 \u221e of aging\nCTRW. Analogously to the aging problem, we illustrate\nthe equilibrated problem setup in the Fig. 2. The sys-\n\nEQUILIBRATED RANDOM WALKS\n\nLet us now consider the system which relaxes to a true\nequilibrium. Such a system would correspond to CTRW\nwith the waitingR time distribution possessing the first\n\u221e\nmoment, h\u03c4 i = 0 \u03c4 \u03c8(\u03c4 )d\u03c4 , which is however so large\nthat the intermediate power-law asymptotics of the function is still seen. The examples are a theta-truncated\npower-law \u03c8(\u03c4 ) = A/(1 + \u03c4 )1+\u03b1 \u03b8(T \u2212 \u03c4 ) or an exponentially truncated one \u03c8(\u03c4 ) = A/(1 + \u03c4 )1+\u03b1 exp(\u2212\u03c4 /T )\n(A is the normalization constant), or an exponentially\ntruncated one-sided Levy-distribution with the Laplace\ntransform \u03c8p = exp[\u2212A(p + 1/\u03bb)\u03b1 + A/\u03bb\u03b1 ] . Here A is\nthe parameter with the dimension [T]\u03b1 and of the absolute value of unity (the typical step time is set to one),\nand \u03bb = (A\u03b1/\u03c4 )1/(1\u2212\u03b1) , where h\u03c4 i is the mean waiting time. The equilibrated case is interesting because it\nis experimentally relevant: systems are typically created much earlier than measurements are performed and\n\nFIG. 2: Problem setup for the equilibrated random walks.\nAt t = t1 we label some of the particles from their uniform\ndistribution and create the profile n(x, t = t1 ) . Later we\nfollow only the diffusion of those marked particles and obtain\nat t2 = t1 + t the density profile nA (x, t = t2 ) .\n\ntem prepared at t = 0 evolves during the time t1 , with\nt1 \u2192 \u221e (in practice it means that the system was created a long time before the measurement took place and\ndevelops a uniform distribution of particles). At the time\nt = t1 we select some profile of the particles n(x, t = t1 )\nand follow only these particles until the time t2 = t1 + t .\nWe start from the transport equation (19) by taking\nits Fourier-Laplace transform:\npnk,p \u2212 n\ne k (t1 ) = \u2212\n\np\u03c8p a2 2\na2\nk nk,p \u2212 k 2 \u03a6(1)\np (t1 ), (23)\n1 \u2212 \u03c8p 2\n2\n\nwhere we returned to our earlier notation for the second\nmemory kernel \u03a61 . In the above equation, the waiting time distribution has a finite first moment, h\u03c4 i , and\ntherefore \u03c8p = 1 \u2212 h\u03c4 i p + o(p) . In addition, the limit\nt1 \u2192 \u221e should be applied. In this case the expression for\nthe second memory kernel \u03a61 (t) is simpler than before.\nIts Laplace transform is given by (see (8) and (11)):\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n1\n(1)\n+1\n(24)\n\u2212\n\u03a6p =\np h\u03c4 i 1 \u2212 \u03c8p\nWe note that in the time domain we now have\n\u03a6(1) (t) = 1/ h\u03c4 i \u2212 f (t) + \u03b4(t) and that f (t) still\nhas a physical meaning of the (time-dependent) density of steps. For a pure power-law CTRW this function\nmonotonously decays to zero with time, while for equilibrated walks it decays to 1/ h\u03c4 i . The transition between the both regimes takes place at at time tc \u2243 h\u03c4 i .\n\n\f6\nHowever, this does not mean that the second memory\nfunction vanishes at times which exceed tc : the difference 1/ h\u03c4 i \u2212 M (t) still can behave as a pure power-law\nin some cases. It is important that the second memory\nfunction is governed by the subleading term in the expansion of 1/(1 \u2212 \u03c8p ) , whose behavior depends on whether\nthe function \u03c8(\u03c4 ) possesses the second moment (we shall\ncall this situation \"a sharp cut-off\") or does not.\nIn the case of a sharp cut-off and for a small p ,\n\u03c8p = 1 \u2212 h\u03c4 i p + M2 p2 + o(p2 ) , where M2 is the second moment of waiting times. Now we have:\n1\n1\n=\n1 \u2212 \u03c8p\nh\u03c4 i p + M2 p2 + o(p2 )\n1\n[1 + (M2 / h\u03c4 i)p + o(p)].\n=\nh\u03c4 i p\n1\nM2\n=\n+ o(1)\n+\nh\u03c4 i p h\u03c4 i2\n\n+ K h\u03c4 i \u039b(p h\u03c4 i)\u2212\u03b1 k 2 n\ne0,k .\n\n(25)\n\nThis means that for small p\n\u03a6(1)\np =1\u2212\n\nM2\nh\u03c4 i2\n\n+ o(1),\n\n(26)\n\nso that the function \u03a6(1) (t) is integrable, with the inte2\ngral being equal to 1\u2212M2/ h\u03c4 i . This in turn means that\n\u03a61 (t) decays faster than t\u22121 and its exact decay form\ndepends on how many moments does \u03c8(\u03c4 ) actually possess. We note that the existence of the second moment is\nnecessary for such a behavior. The overall fractional diffusion equation for such a process in the long-time limit\ntends to a normal diffusion equation of the type\n\u2202n(x, t)\n= K\u25b3n(x, t) + C\u03b4(t)\u25b3e\nn0 ,\n\u2202t\n\nmonotonous derivative (see [20]). For p \u2192 0 , \u03c8p behaves as \u03c8p \u2243 1 \u2212 p h\u03c4 i , i.e. the corresponding PDF\n\u03c8(\u03c4 ) has the mean value of h\u03c4 i . The parameter \u039b is\na free parameter of the order of unity which governs the\nprecise form of the crossover.\nProvided that p is small enough, we can take\n\u03c8p \u2248 1 \u2212 p h\u03c4 i /[1 + \u039b(p h\u03c4 i)1\u2212\u03b1 ] which corresponds to\n1/(1\u2212\u03c8p ) = 1/(p h\u03c4 i)+\u039b(p h\u03c4 i)\u2212\u03b1 . By substituting this\nexpression into (23) we obtain:\n\u0003\n\u0002\npnk,p \u2212 n\ne 0,k = \u2212K 1 + \u039b(p h\u03c4 i)1\u2212\u03b1 k 2 nk,p\n\n(27)\n\nwhere K stands for the diffusion coefficient K = a2 / h\u03c4 i\n2\nand the constant C is given by C = (1 \u2212 M2 / h\u03c4 i )a2 ,\ni.e. to the ordinary diffusion equation with some correction to the initial condition. This correction vanishes\nonly for the Markovian random walk process with expo2\nnential waiting time distribution for which M2 = h\u03c4 i .\nIn the case when the second moment does not exist,\nthe situation can be vastly different. In order to present\nthis type of behavior let us consider a special example\nof the waiting time distribution for which we can convert\nEq.(23) in the Fourier-Laplace domain into a distributedorder fractional diffusion equation with a source in space\nand time. Let us take \u03c8p in a form\n\u0014\n\u0015\np h\u03c4 i\n\u03c8p = exp \u2212\n.\n(28)\n1 + \u039b(p h\u03c4 i)1\u2212\u03b1\nThis function is completely monotonic, which, according\nto the Bernstein's theorem, means that it is a Laplace\ntransform of a probability density function. To prove\nthis it is enough to note that \u03c8p has a form e\u2212hp with\nthe function hp > 0 , hp |p=0 = 0 and possesses a\n\n(29)\n\nIn normal space-time domain this equation corresponds\nto\ni\nh\n\u2202n(x, t)\n1\u2212\u03b1\n1\u2212\u03b1\n\u25b3n(x, t)\n= K 1 + \u039b h\u03c4 i\n0 Dt\n\u2202t\n1\u2212\u03b1\n\u039b h\u03c4 i\nt\u22121+\u03b1 \u25b3e\nn0 ,\n(30)\n\u2212 K\n\u0393(\u03b1)\nNote the distributed order derivative ( 1+\u039b\u03c4 1\u2212\u03b1 0 Dt1\u2212\u03b1 )\non the r.h.s. [20], which is typical for systems showing\ncrossover behavior, and the extremely slowly dissolving\nof the initial condition!\nThe difference between the cases of the equilibrated\nrandom walks corresponding to the waiting time distributions with or without second moment (mirrored\nin the difference of the form of the corresponding generalized Fokker-Planck equation) is intimately connected with the question whether the mean forward waiting time (the mean waiting time of the first step\nafter the beginning of observations) exists. Indeed,\nlooking at the limit of the Laplace transform in the\nfirst argument of the forward waiting time distribution for the equilibrated case ( t1 \u2192 \u221e ) we see that\n(1)\n\u03c8p \u2192 (1 \u2212 \u03c8p )/ h\u03c4 i p .

It\nis known that the second moment of equilibrated CTRW\nbehaves diffusively at all times. However, the higher moments of the density profile are much more exotic when\nthe second moment of \u03c8(\u03c4 ) does not exist.

The functions f2n (t) are the\ninverse Laplace transforms of f2n,p = 1/p2 (1 \u2212 \u03c8p )n\u22121 .\nFor the waiting time distribution with infinite second moment considered above, its asymptotic Laplace transform\nis as follows:\nf2n,p =\n\n1 + \u039b(p h\u03c4 i)1\u2212\u03b1\npn+1 h\u03c4 i\n\nn\u22121\n\n(33)\n\nIn the time domain it corresponds to the following behavior:\n\uf8f1 n\u22121\n\u2212\u03b1(n\u22121)\nh\u03c4 i\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u039b\nt(n\u22121)\u03b1+1 for t < h\u03c4 i\n\u0393[(n \u2212 1)\u03b1 + 2]\nf2n (t) \u2243\n\uf8f4\n1\n\uf8f3\ntn\nfor t \u226b h\u03c4 i\nn!\u03c4 n\u22121\n(34)\nThis means, for example, that the distribution of the\nparticles' positions at an intermediate time is considerably platykurtotic, and only slowly tends to a Gaussian\nin course of time with a typical transition time h\u03c4 i . We\nnote here that such a slow convergence to a Gaussian is\ntypical also for other random walks models with truncated power-laws, as exemplified by truncated L\u00e9vy flights\n[21, 22].\n\n4. GREEN'S FUNCTION APPROACH AND\nTHE PROBLEM OF AGING ENSEMBLES\n\nIn the previous sections, we considered the results for\na specific setup of an aging problem corresponding especially to a displacement of a single particle labeled at\nt = t1 in course of its further temporal evolution or of the\nensemble of such labeled particles. Let us consider another setup for aging problem. Assume that the full profile\nof the density of particles (or the full probability density\nfor a single particle) at t = t1 is known (for example,\nwe started with a thermodynamically large ensemble of\nparticles and were able to measure their density at t = t1\nwith high enough precision) or is known in principle as\nit is assumed when calculating, say, the correlation functions [23]. Does it give us additional information which\nmight improve the prediction of the particles' positions?\nWhat would be the following evolution of this profile and\nhow will it depend on the aging time?\n\nThe GME approach used in Sec. 2 relies on a special\ndefinition of the aging ensemble. The system was created\nat t = 0 and evolves according to the CTRW dynamics\nup to the time t1 , where the first measurement of the\nparticle's position (or the the particles' positions) takes\nplace. No explicite notion about the initial distribution\nof the particles' positions at t = 0 is assumed or used.\nIn any case, we follow up only the particles tagged at\nt = t1 . The situation considered in the present section\ncorresponds to a different ensemble.\nImagine now that we have two experiments (probably\nwith different initial conditions), which are such that the\nexact measured density in one of them is the same as the\ndensity of labeled particles in the another one. Will the\nfurther development of the densities be the same? If not,\nwhat is the difference? As we proceed to show, the two\nsituations lead to different results for the higher moments\nof the distribution. It is worth mentioning that the distribution of the first exit times after the measuring event is\nthe only quantity affected by aging and it determines the\nfuture evolution of the system for both definitions [14]. It\ndepends on the initial conditions through the correlation\nbetween the particle's position and the forward waiting\ntime, as discussed in Ref. [24].\n\nFIG. 3: The second aging problem setup. At t = t1 the\nfull density profile, n(x, t = t1 ) is measured. By using the\nGreen's function it is possible to propagate it back and reproduce the initial distribution at t = 0 , n(x, t = 0) . Then it is\nforwarded until the time t2 = t1 + t to obtain the prediction\nfor the future evolution nG (x, t = t2 ) . In contrast to the\nfirst aging problem, diffusion from a single point x1 will depend on both, the starting point x1 and the aging time t1 :\nn(x, x1 , t1 , t) . The grayscale shadows and dashed line in the\n(x, t) plane show the diffusion from the initial distribution\nand a single point.\n\nThe difference between the two setups, the one of Fig. 1\nand the one of Fig. 3, on the qualitative level, can be understood already now. In the given point x1 at the time\nt = t1 , there are particles which have arrived different\ntimes ago and, therefore, will make their next steps also\nat different times [25, 26]. In the first aging setup, we\nvirtually ignore the dependence of these exit times on x1\n(the relative position in the full density profile, if the latter is known). Therefore, we assume that in all points\n\n\f8\nthe distribution of exit times depends only on t1 . In the\nsecond aging problem, we take into consideration the relative position of the point x1 . It is clear that particles\nwhich occur to be found at the wing of the density profile\ntypically have made much more steps than those found\nclose to the center of the profile. Moreover, the particles\nwhich had to make a lot of jumps probably have arrived\nat their actual position very recently, i.e. start their last\nwaiting period not long ago before t1 . This implies that\nthe distribution of exit times depends on x1 which affects the diffusion of particles out of this point. Therefore\ncorresponding profiles in the Fig. 1 and 3, n(x, t1 , t) and\nn(x, x1 , t1 , t) are different. By repeating the same argumentation for each point in the profile n(x, t = t1 ) we\nmay conclude that nA and nG will be different as well.\nWe will come back to this question later in the text.\nLet us now return to the case when the PDF of particles' positions at t = t1 is known exactly and note that\nthe temporal evolution of the PDF from true initial conditions to the state at time t is described by the linear\nevolution operator \u015c(t) . If the time evolution operator has an inverse defined at least on a set of relevant\nPDFs n(x, t) , one can propagate this PDF back in time\nto t = 0 , thus getting n(x, 0) = n0 (x) and then forward\nin time up to t2 > t1 to obtain n(x, t2 ) [27]:\nn(x, t2 ) = \u015c(t2 )\u015c \u22121 (t1 )n(x, t1 ).\n\n(35)\n\nThis defines the linear time evolution operator\n\u015c(t2 ; t1 ) = \u015c(t2 )\u015c \u22121 (t1 ) which gives us the PDF at the\ntime t2 provided the PDF at the time t1 is known.\nLet us first find the explicit form of the \u015c(t2 ; t1 ) operator and then discuss the difference between this aging problem, and the first one, considered above. The\ntime evolution operator, \u015c(t2 ; t1 ) , follows from the explicit form of the solution of the transport equation via\nthe Green's functions method: it is the integral operator\ncontaining the Green's functions of the standard CTRW\nequation, G(x, x\u2032 , t) . Let us recall the form of the transport equation for CTRW without aging, i.e. all particles\nwere introduced at t = 0 without history (the first part\nof Eq.(10) or Eq.(18)):\n\u1e45(x, t) =\n\nZ\n\nt\n0\n\n+\u221e\nZ\n\u03a6(t\u2212\u03c4 )\ng(y) [n(x \u2212 y, \u03c4 ) \u2212 n(x, \u03c4 )] dyd\u03c4.\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(36)\nThe Green's function is defined as the solution of the\nabove equation with n(x, t = 0) = \u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 ) . Then, for\narbitrary initial distribution n0 (x) we can write:\nZ +\u221e\nG(x, x\u2032 , t)n0 (x\u2032 )dx\u2032 . (37)\nn(x, t) = \u015c(t)n(x, 0) =\n\u2212\u221e\n\nFor the homogeneous situation considered here, the\nGreen's function depends only on the difference of its spatial variables: G(x, x\u2032 , t) = G(x \u2212 x\u2032 , t) . Therefore, the\nsolution can be found as a convolution of the initial condition with the Green's function. By denoting the convolution operation with *, we can write \u015c(t) = G(x, t)\u2217 ,\n\ni.e.\nn(x, t) = \u015c(t)n0 (x) \u2261 G(x, t) \u2217 n0 (x).\n\n(38)\n\nThe PDFs of the particles' distributions at time t1 and\nt2 = t1 + t are thus given by\nn(x, t1 + t) = G(x, t1 + t) \u2217 n0 (x),\nn(x, t1 ) = G(x, t1 ) \u2217 n0 (x)\n\n(39)\n\nUnder the Fourier transforms, convolutions are changed\ninto simple products of Fourier components:\nnk (t1 + t) = Gk (t1 + t2 )n0,k ,\nnk (t1 ) = Gk (t1 )n0,k .\n\n(40)\n\nFrom these two we formally find:\nnk (t1 + t) =\n\nGk (t1 + t)\n* nk (t1 ),\nGk (t1 )\n\n(41)\n\nand now write the time evolution operator\n\u015c(t2 , t1 ) = \u015c(t2 )\u015c \u22121 (t1 ) as an integral convolution\noperator T (x, t2 , t1 )\u2217 with the integral kernel being the\ninverse Fourier transform of Gk (t1 + t)/Gk (t1 ) .\nFor the CTRW model its Green's function can be easily found analytically [2], so that also the corresponding\noperator \u015c(t2 , t1 ) can be immediately calculated. The\nGreen's function for a CTRW equation (the solution of\n(36)) in the Fourier-Laplace space is\nGk,p =\n\n1 \u2212 \u03c8p\n.\np (1 \u2212 \u03c8p gk )\n\n(42)\n\nWe can now compare the resulting density distributions\nobtained in the two aging problems, namely Eq.(18) and\n(41). To do this we analyze the difference of the two\ndensities \u03b4n(x, t) = nG \u2212 nA , with nG being the PDF\npredicted by the Green's function approach (41), and nA\nbeing the one given by the by the probabilistic approach\n(18) of Section 2.2. In particular we concentrate on the\nbehavior of\nR \u221emoments of the density difference defined as\nhxn i\u03b4n = \u2212\u221e xn \u03b4ndx .\nAs an example we consider the following situation.\nImagine that the system evolved starting from a sharp\n(delta-function) initial condition n(x, t = 0) = \u03b4(x) . In\nthis case the particles' distribution at t = t1 is given by\nthe inverse Fourier transform of nk (t1 ) = Gk (t1 ) . This\ndistribution is now used as the intermediate-time initial\ncondition at t = t1 in both approaches, in the one of Sec.\n2 and in the one of the present Section. Then the results\nof these two approaches are compared. Eq.(41) reduces\nin this case to a simple formula nG\nk (t + t1 ) = Gk (t + t1 ) .\nOmitting the details of rather tedious calculations, we\ncan show that the second moment of the density difference, x2 \u03b4n , is equal to zero. However, already the next\neven moment, x4 \u03b4n , deviates from zero. The final expression for the forth moment of the density difference\n\n\f9\nreads:\n4\n\nx\n\n\u03b4n\n\nsin \u03c0\u03b3\n= 24\n\u03c0\u03b3\u0393(\u03b3)2\n\nZt\n\nd\u03c4\n(t \u2212 \u03c4 )1\u2212\u03b3\n\n(43)\n\n0\n\n\u00d7\n\nZt1 \u0010\n0\n\n\u03c41 \u00111\u2212\u03b3 1\n[t\u03b3 \u2212 (t1 \u2212 \u03c41 )\u03b3 ] d\u03c41 .\n\u03c4\n\u03c41 + \u03c4 1\n\nIn Fig.1 we plot x4 \u03b4n given by (43) as a function of\ntime for three different aging times, for the case \u03b3 = 1/2\n(the exponent in the power tail of the waiting time distribution). These findings show that the approach based on\n\nFIG. 4: The forth moment of \u03b4n(x, t) = nG \u2212 nA , as a function of time, t , for different aging times t1 and \u03b3 = 1/2 .\nIts deviation from zero shows the difference between the prediction given by Eq.(18) as compared to the Green's function\nresult (41).\n\nthe backward-forward propagation delivers a result which\nis different from the one given by the approach of Sec.\n2. It is also necessary to stress, that the aged propagator n(x, t, t1 ) given by (18) is not the Green's function\nof aged anomalous diffusion, since it does not reproduce\nthe PDF of the particles exactly. The Gaussian situation\nshowing no aging is the only one when the both approaches are equivalent (and give the same result): in this case\nGk (t) \u221d exp(\u2212Dk 2 t) so that Gk (t1 +t)/Gk (t1 ) = Gk (t) .\nLet us discuss some implications of the two approaches. The Green's function approach utilizes more information about the intermediate stage of the system (the full\nknowledge of the whole distribution) and corresponds to\na different nonequilibrium statistical ensemble than the\none of Sec. 2. On the other hand, the approach of Sec. 2\nassumes no knowledge about the initial condition, i.e. essentially starts from the assumption that at t = 0 the\ndistribution of particles in space was uniform (which is\nthe most reasonable assumption about the state of the\nstatistical system provided no additional information is\ngiven and corresponds exactly to the Jaynes' information\napproach to statistical mechanics [29]). It is clear that\nthe homogeneous distribution does not evolve in course\n\nof the time and stays uniform up to the time t = t1 .\nAt t = t1 we choose some profile n(x, t = t1 ) from this\ndistribution (see the Fig. 2) and follow its evolution.\nAs we have mentioned above, the physical reason for\nbeing able to predict exactly the dynamics of particles after a measurement, is the precise knowledge of their exit\ntimes. The Green's function approach uses this information only indirectly, just propagating the profile back and\nthen forward and automatically provides the corresponding distributions. This approach is not literally applicable in a whatever case when the intermediate time density\ndistribution is not a full profile resulting from the previous evolution of some initial density. There exist, however methods which work with microscopic distributions\ndirectly and can be applied to such cases as well. The\nfirst one is based on the generalized transport equation\nwith microscopic details taken into account [17], another\none considers two-point probability distributions [24, 30].\nBoth of these more general approaches (not restricted to\nthe aging problems) give answers corresponding to the\nGreen's function approach when starting from a concentrated initial condition (and therefore for a whatever exactly known one). Moreover, these approaches allow for\nthe full solution of the aging problem in the setup of the\nSec. 2, where the exit times after the measurement tend\nto be independent of coordinate. The results for the equilibrated walks provided by methods of Refs. [17, 24] and\nby that of the Sec. 2 coincide since the information about\nthe initial state of the system is forgotten.\nIt is important to state that the two ensembles corresponding to the two approaches discussed in this work are\nnot the only two alternatives, but two of a quite broad\nspectrum of possibilities. They provide however the two\nlimiting situations: the full knowledge and no knowledge\nabout this distribution. There are various situations possible, when the distribution of the particles' positions at\nthe intermediate time is known to some extent or with\nsome uncertainty, in which case the results for aging will\ndepend on what exactly was measured at t = t1 and\nwhat the precision of this measurement was.\n\n5.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nSummarizing our findings, we have derived a general\nequation for the PDF of the particle's position in aging\nCTRW, corresponding to the \"intermediate-time initial\ncondition\" setup, in which the coordinate of the particle is measured at some time t1 after the preparation\nof the system considered to take place at t = 0 . We\nwere able to express the second memory function, describing the dissolving of the initial condition, through\nthe memory kernel of the CTRW equation. We discussed\nthe ensuing forms of the transport equation for the case\nof CTRW with power-law waiting time distributions lacking the first moment, as well for the equilibrating situations, where the first moment exists. We have shown\nthat the exact form of the corresponding equation for\n\n\f10\nequilibrating walks depends on whether the second moment of the waiting time distribution exists or not. In\nthe first case, the normal diffusion equation appears, in\nthe second case, the evolution is described by the diffusion equation with distributed-order temporal derivative\nand with a very slowly dissolving second memory function following the power law. The asymptotic behavior\nof the higher moments of the density profile for this case\nwas also calculated and indicated a slow convergence to\nthe Gaussian behavior.\nMoreover, as we tried to show, the problem of aging\nis a very delicate task even in the framework of exactly solvable model of CTRW. To illustrate this we have\nconsidered and solved another possible aging setup corresponding to the full knowledge of the PDF of the particles' positions at time t1 after the preparation of the\n\nsystem at t = 0 . The two setups give different predictions for the evolution of the particles density and correspond to different experimental realizations. This shows\nthat there is still a room for further developments in the\narea. One of those is the question of the prediction of\nthe evolution based on an incomplete intermediate-time\ninitial condition. This work is currently in progress.\n\n[1] E. W. Montroll and M. F.

However,\nthe technical implementation of this idea is faulty. This\ncan be seen when considering Eq.(18) of Ref. [23]. We\nnote that taking t2 = t1 = t in this equation has to\ngive W (X2 , t; X1 , t) = \u03b4(x2 \u2212 x1 ) : the particle cannot\nbe at two different points at the same time.
