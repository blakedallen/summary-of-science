Here we report the results of a multiwavelength\nstudy of the X-ray source population in the field of the interacting pair of galaxies NGC 5774/5775. A total of 49 discrete sources are detected, including 12\nultraluminous X-ray source candidates with luminosities above 1039 ergs s\u22121 in\nthe 0.5 \u2013 8.0 keV X-ray band. X-ray source positions are mapped onto optical\nand radio images to search for potential counterparts. Twelve sources in the field\nhave optical counterparts. Optical colors are used to differentiate these sources,\nwhich are mostly located outside the optical extent of the interacting galaxies,\nas potential globular clusters (2), one compact blue dwarf galaxy and quasars\n(5). We obtained optical spectra of two of the latter, which confirm that they\nare background quasars. We expect 3 background sources in the field of these\ntwo galaxies. These results are used to determine the true X-ray population of\nthese two interacting galaxies, which are connected with two bridges. Two high\nmass X-ray binaries are detected on these two bridges suggesting their formation\nthrough the interaction-induced starformation episode.\nNGC 5774 is an extremely low starforming galaxy with five X-ray sources\nplus three ultraluminous X-ray source candidates. Observed X-ray population\nof this galaxy does not scale with the starformation rate alone but it may scale\njointly with the mass of the galaxy and the starformation rate.\n1\n\nUniversities Space Research Association, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, VP62, Huntsville, AL,\nUSA\n2\n\nSpace Science Department, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, VP62, Huntsville, AL, USA\n\n3\n\nRaman Research Institute, Bangalore, India\n\n4\n\nRIKEN Institute of Physical & Chemical Sciences, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wakoshi, Saitama 351-0198, Japan\n\n5\n\nLaboratoire d'Astrophysique, Universite Joseph-Fourier, 414 rue de la Piscine, 38400 Saint-Martin\nd'Heres, France\n6\n\nInstituto de Astrofsica de Canarias (IAC), E-38205 La Laguna, Tenerife, Spain\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nTwenty four X-ray sources (excluding the AGN) are detected in NGC 5775.\nand its X-ray luminosity function is consistent with that of other interacting\ngalaxies, suggesting that these galaxies have comparable numbers of luminous\nsources. No X-ray point source was detected at the center of this galaxy to a\nlimiting luminosity of 3\u00d71037 ergs s \u22121 . Wind/outflow is detected from the central\nregion of NGC 5775. Sub-solar diffuse gas with temperature \u223c0.31\u00b10.04 keV is\npresent in this galaxy, which suggest that NGC 5775 is in the beginning of the\nevolutionary process.\nTwelve ultraluminous X-ray source candidates are detected within the D25\nisophotes of NGC5774/5775. Several of them are highly variable X-ray sources\nthat fall below the detection levels in one of two X-ray observations spaced\n15 months apart. Two ultraluminous X-ray sources are located in the halo of\nNGC5775 and one of theme is hosted in a globular star cluster. Four of the remaining 10 candidates have powerlaw X-ray spectra with photon indices around\n1.8 and are extremely luminous with no optical counterparts. One of these four\nobjects is the brightest (\u223c1041 ergs s\u22121 ) with a possible 6.2 hr period and it varied by more than a factor of 500. Two of the rest six ultraluminous X-ray source\ncandidates are having steep-powerlaw X-ray spectra and are embedded in diffuse\nH\u03b1 emission, which are probably ionized nebulae. These nebulae could be due\nto energetic supernova explosions or to continuous inflation by jets. Rest four\nultraluminous X-ray source candidates are flat-powerlaw X-ray sources hosted\nin either young star clusters or bright starforming complexes. Two of them are\nradio sources. Finally, we find that the number of ultraluminous X-ray source\ncandidates in interacting/merging galaxies are correlated with the FIR, K-band\nand UV luminosities of their host galaxies, suggesting that the formation and\nevolution of ultraluminous X-ray sources depend not only on the starformation\nrate but also on the mass of their host galaxies.\nSubject headings: X-rays : binaries - galaxies: interactions - X-rays : individual\n(NGC 5774 and NGC 5775) - black hole physics\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe most luminous non-nuclear X-ray sources in nearby galaxies occur in regions of\nhigh rates of current star formation (Roberts & Warwick 2000; Colbert & Ptak 2002; Swartz\net al 2004; Liu & Mirabel 2005). Whether these ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs)\nare powered by some exotic emission process or represent the extreme end of stellar-mass\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nblack hole formation (in excess of \u223c20 M\u2299 , the upper limit for stars of moderate metallicity\nevolving in isolation, Fryer & Kalogera 2001) is a matter of current debate (for recent reviews\non ULXs see Fabbiano 2006; King 2006; Fabbiano & White 2006). Different models have\nbeen proposed to explain the ULX phenomena and they can be grouped into different broad\ncategories: (i) geometrically/mechanically- (King et al. 2001a; Fabrika & Mescheryakov\n2001; Fabrika 2004; Poutanen et al. 2007) or relativistically beamed or super-Eddington\naccretion stellar-mass black hole systems (K\u00f6rding et al. 2002; Georganopoulus et al. 2002;\nAbramowicz et al. 1980; Arons 1992; Gammie 1998; Begelman 2002, 2006; Grim, Gilfanov\n& Sunyaev 2002), (ii) supernovae and hypernovae (Terlevich 1992; Schlegel 1995; Paczynski\n1998; Wang 1999; Li 2003), (iii) supersoft sources (Swartz et al. 2002; Kong & Di Stefano\n2005), (iv) accreting intermediate-mass black hole systems (IMBHs) with masses in the\nrange 50 \u2013 105 M\u2299 (Colbert & Mushotzky 1999; Makishima et al. 2000; Madau & Rees\n2001; Ebisuzaki et al. 2001; Portegies-Zwart & McMillian 2002; Miller & Hamilton 2002;\nHo, Terashima & Okajima 2003; Mushotzky 2004; van der Marel 2004; Freitag et al. 2006),\nand (v) foreground/background objects, which mimic as ULXs (Arp et al. 2004; Gutierrez\n2006; Gutierrez & Lopez-Corredoira 2005, 2007 and references therein).\nObservationally, periodic variations in the X-ray light curves of some ULXs have been\ndetected, which suggest that they are stellar-mass black hole binaries (Sugiho et al. 2001;\nBauer et al. 2001; Liu et al. 2002, 2005; Strohmayer & Mushotzky 2003; Pietsch, Haberl &\nVogler 2003; Pietsch et al. 2004; Stobbart, Roberts & Warwick 2004; Weisskopf et al. 2004;\nSoria et al. 2004; Soria & Motch 2004; Mukai et al. 2005; Ghosh et al. 2006; Fabbiano et\nal. 2006). In addition, spectral curvatures have been detected in the X-ray spectra of a few\nluminous ULXs (Dewangan et al. 2004; 2006 and references therein), which suggest that\nthese objects are beamed stellar-mass black hole binaries. On the other hand, by analogy\nwith the X-ray spectra of Galactic black hole binaries, a multicolor disk (MCD) blackbody\ncomponent with temperature around 100 eV (plus powerlaw) has been considered as the\nsignature of a cool accretion disk of an IMBH system (Miller et al. 2003; Kaaret et al. 2003;\nMiller et al. 2004; 2004a; Cropper et al. 2004; Kong et al. 2004). In addition, quasi-periodic\noscillations (QPOs) with long quasi periods have been detected in some ULXs (Liu et al\n2005; Strohmayor & Mushotzky et al. 2003; Soria et al. 2004; Strohmayer et al. 2007).\nComparison of these results with the scaling relation between black hole mass and breakfrequency of QPO suggests the presence of IMBHs in these ULXs (Belloni & Hasinger 1990).\nHowever, the suggestions of IMBH systems based on the MCD model have been questioned\nand alternate explanations in the frame works of stellar-mass black hole systems have been\nproposed (King & Pounds 2003; Roberts et al. 2005; Stobbart et al. 2006; Goncalves & Soria\n2006; Barnard et al. 2007). In addition, Hui, Krolik & Hubeney (2005) have shown that nonLTE accretion flows around IMBHs can easily generate hot accretion disks with temperatures\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nup to 1 keV, which is in sharp contrast to the conventional MCD model. All these results\nsuggest that ULXs are heterogeneous objects (Feng & Kaaret 2005, 2006; Roberts et al.\n2006; Winter et al. 2006, 2007). Similarly, optical photometric and spectroscopic studies\nhave revealed that stars, star clusters, ionized nebulae, etc. are possible optical counterparts\nof ULXs (Ghosh et al. 2001, 2005; Soria et al. 2005; Ptak et al. 2006; Ramsey et al.\n2006). Optical spectroscopic studies on the local environments of some ULXs have detected\ndifferent emission lines, which suggest that both shock and photo-ionization excitations are\nthe dominant physical processes around these objects (Abolmasov 2007a,b; Mucciarelli et\nal. 2005, 2007; Zepf et al. 2007). In summary, no clear picture is emerging to differentiate\nbetween compact accretor models of ULXs, yet it is certain that most are young objects born\nin extreme environments.\nSome of the highest star formation rates are induced by interactions among gas-rich\n(spiral) galaxies and it is natural to expect these interacting galaxies to host numerous ULXs.\nThis is consistent with the observed anti-correlation between the number of ULXs per galaxy\nand nearest neighbor distance (Swartz et al. 2004). The face-on pair of merging galaxies\nNGC 4038/4039 (the Antennae) is the prototypical example of this paradigm: As many\nas 18 ULXs are present in the Antennae depending on the distance adopted and defining\nULXs to have X-ray luminosities above 1039 ergs s\u22121 (Zezas et al. 2002). In addition,\nwe have found from our survey of ULXs in the Chandra archive of galaxies that there is\na correlation between the number of ULXs and the far infrared luminosity of interacting\ngalaxies (Swartz et al. 2004). Presently, there are a few known interacting galaxies that\nhost elevated number of ULXs. Thus, X-ray studies of interacting galaxies are important,\nspecially from the perspective of ULX studies.\nThe galaxy pair NGC 5774/5775 is another example of star formation triggered by\ntidal interaction between galaxies resulting in the creation of many luminous X-ray sources.\nNGC 5775 is a SBc starburst galaxy seen nearly edge-on, i \u223c 86\u25e6 , with star formation\nextending throughout its visible disk. As with many interacting pairs (e.g., Kennicutt et\nal. 1987), star formation in NGC 5775, although triggered by external forces, appears to\nresult from tidally induced gas motions within the disk of NGC 5775 rather than by mass\ntransfer between the galaxies. It is connected to NGC 5774 by Hi bridges (Irwin 1994) but\nthere are no other obvious distortions in optical images such as tidal tails or disk warping\ncommon in more advanced stages of interaction (for example, tidal tails are the defining\noptical characteristics of the Antennae merging galaxy pair). The outer disk of the face-on\ncompanion SAB(rs)d galaxy NGC 5774 may have been disrupted by the interaction (Irwin\n1994) and this is the apparent source of the bridge material. The rate of mass transfer\nthrough the bridge is estimated to be only about 5\u201310 M\u2299 yr\u22121 and Irwin (1994) estimates\nthe age of the interaction from dynamical considerations to be \u223c108 yr. Star formation in\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nNGC 5774 is proceeding at a normal rate for an Sd galaxy. Neither galaxy displays strong\nAGN activity (Ho, Filippenko & Sargent 1997).\nThe Chandra X-ray Observatory image of the NGC 5774/5775 pair reflects the contrasts between the IR-bright starburst galaxy NGC 5775 and its relatively normal companion\nNGC 5774. Only nine sources are detected in NGC 5774 and there is no diffuse component\nvisible. In contrast, twenty-five bright discrete sources are visible above the detection limit\nof \u223c1038 ergs s\u22121 in the disk of NGC 5775. The disk sources are embedded in extensive\ndiffuse hot gas. Several more sources are in the surrounding region including the Hi bridges.\nThus, this interacting pair of galaxies, NGC 5774/5775 is an ideal laboratory to investigate\nthe formation of X-ray sources on the bridges, to study the role of starburst activities on\nthe evolution of galaxies and formation of ULXs, and finally to study the nature of a large\nnumber of wide varieties of ULXs. To achieve these scientific objectives, we have analyzed\nthe available X-ray, optical, and radio data of the galaxy pair and their surroundings; supplemented by new optical imaging, spectroscopy, and radio continuum measurements. In\n\u00a7 2, we describe the observations, our data reduction methods and results. In \u00a7 3, we discuss\nthe source population as a whole in the context of current theories for ULX formation and\nthe relationship between ULXs and galactic dynamics and star formation. Conclusions of\nthe present studies are listed in \u00a7 4. We adopt a cosmology H0 =73 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9M =0.24\nand \u03a9\u039b =0.76 (Spergel et al. 2007).\n\n2.\n\nMultiwavelength Observations and Data Analysis\n\nAn optical image of the NGC 5774/5775 field is shown in Figure 1. The image is\n6. 6\u00d75.\u2032 8 corresponding to 51.5\u00d745.2 kpc at the 26.8 Mpc distance to the galaxy pair (Tully\n1988). The Hi bridges connecting these two galaxies extend roughly along the line described\nby the disk of the edge-on starburst galaxy NGC 5775 from the NW tip of NGC 5775 to\nNGC 5774 and from the SE of NGC 5774 eastward to the center of NGC 5775. The NW\nbridge is visible in the optical image, shown in Fig. 1 but the SE bridge is barely visible.\nHowever, they are much more pronounced at radio wavelengths as shown by Irwin (1994)\nand by Lee et al. (2001).\n\u2032\n\n2.1.\n\nX-ray Observations\n\nChandra Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) observations of the NGC 5774/5775\nsystem were carried out on April 05, 2002 for 58.2 ks (ObsID 2940 & Principal Investiga-\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\ntor \u2013 Philip Maloney). Level 2 event list for this data set was retrieved from the Chandra\narchive. NGC 5774 is located on the front-illuminated CCD S2 and NGC 5775 is on the\nback-illuminated CCD S3. We use the locally-developed software tool LEXTRCT (Tennant\n2006) for data analysis, which is described in details in Swartz et al. (2003). Source detections in LEXTRCT were performed using a circular Gaussian approximation to the point\nspread function (PSF), which gives higher weight to sources with a central concentration of\nevents. Point-source counts and spectra were extracted from within the 95% encircled-energy\naperture of the model PSF. Background regions were typically chosen from annular regions\nsurrounding the source regions except in crowded regions of the field where background\nregions adjacent to the source were used. The background-subtracted counts within the\nsource regions were scaled to obtain the aperture-corrected count values. The backgroundsubtracted point source detection limit is 14 counts for the 2.8 minimum signal-to-noise\nratio (S/N) threshold and a minimum 5 \u03c3 above background. We define the total field as\nthe 6.\u2032 6\u00d75.\u2032 8 rectangle, in R.A. and Dec, that inscribes both D25 ellipses. Forty-nine sources\nwere detected in this field. Their properties are listed in Table 1. The Chandra image of the\nNGC 5774/5775 field is shown in Figure 2 with the distribution of X-ray sources detected in\nthe field. The ellipses shown delineate the D25 isophotes of these two galaxies.\nSource and background spectra and light curves were used for spectral and timing\nanalysis, respectively. X-ray light curves were binned into 1000 s bins. We computed the\nKolmogorov-Smirnov statistic to determine the time variability of sources by comparing the\ncumulative event arrival times, binned at the 3.24 s frame time, to that expected for a steady\nsource. The resulting KS probabilities are listed in column 10 of Table 1. We also performed\na \u03c72 test against a constant flux hypothesis for each light curve and the results are presented\nin column 11 of Table 1.\nX-ray spectra of all the sources and the corresponding backgrounds were binned so that\nthere were at least 10 counts per fitting bin. Spectral fit were made to sources with more\nthan 40 detected source counts. Spectral redistribution matrices and ancillary response files\nwere generated using Chandra X-ray Center software CIAO version 3.4. XSPEC version\n11.3.2t was used to fit the 0.5 \u2013 8.0 keV energy spectra with an absorbed (phabs) powerlaw\n(powerlaw) model. Best-fitting model parameters and fit statistics are listed in columns 5\u20137\nof Table 1. These spectra have also been fitted with other models as described in the sections\non individual sources (\u00a73 and \u00a74). The observed spectra, with best-fitting powerlaw models\nand fit residuals, are shown in Figure 3. Intrinsic luminosities of these sources based on these\nspectral fits are listed in column 8 of Table 1. Intrinsic luminosities for sources with fewer\nthan 40 source counts were estimated by allowing only the model normalization to vary in\nthe fitting procedure (using appropriate response matrices and ancillary response files) and\nfreezing the powerlaw photon index to 1.8 and the absorption column to the Galactic NH\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nvalue in the direction of NGC 5774/5775 (3.47 x 1020 cm\u22122 ) in WebPIMMS1 . The photon\nindex value of 1.8 is very close to the average value of the powerlaw index, for sources with\nstatistically-acceptable powerlaw fits measured in our catalog of ULXs (Swartz et al. 2004).\n\nFig. 1.- Optical image of the NGC 5774/5775 field adapted from Sloan Digital Sky Survey\ndata (blue, green and red correspond to the g, r and i bands). North is up and East is to\nthe left in this and all subsequent images of the NGC 5774/5775 field. The starburst galaxy\nNGC 5775 is the nearly edge-on galaxy to the left (east) in this image, NGC 5774 is nearly\nface-on and located to the NW. Diffuse optical emission is present between NGC 5774 and\nNGC 5775, visible to the north-east of NGC 5775, where an Hi bridge connects these two\n1\n\nhttp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Tools/w3pimms.html\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\ngalaxies. Another, less prominent, bridge extends from the SE of NGC 5774 eastward to\nNGC 5775 (cf. Irwin 1994 Figure 3; Lee et al. 2001 Figure 1.), which will be defined as the\nSE-bridge.\n\nFig. 2.- Chandra 6.\u2032 6\u00d75.\u2032 8 X-ray image of NGC 5774/5775 field. Positions of detected\nsources are marked with crosses and circles whose sizes are proportional to the size of the\npoint-spread function at their position on the detector. Twelve sources with possible optical\ncounterparts are marked with squares. Possible optical counterpart means the presence of\nan optical object within the astrometric-corrected error circle at the position of the Chandra\nsource.

The curve through the data is the\nbest-fitting powerlaw model. Fit residuals are shown in the lower panel for each source.\nA 47 ks XMM-Newton observation of NGC 5774/5775 was carried out on July 2003\n(ObsID 0150350101). The data was processed using the XMM-Newton Science Analysis\nSystem (version 6.5.0). This observation suffered from background flares. After filtering\nthese flares, only 22.6 ks of useful data remained. The XMM-Newton/MOS 1 image of\nNGC 5774/5775 is shown in Figure 4. Seven sources were detected in the entire field.\nTheir X-ray properties, using the EPIC MOS and PN data, are listed in Table 2. Six of\nthese were previously detected with Chandra (and they are numbered in Table 2 using the\nnumbering scheme of Table 1). The one source detected only in the XMM-Newton data is\nlisted source #49 in Table 1. We did not perform variability studies on the XMM-Newton\ndata due to the strong background flare activity. Absorbed powerlaw model fit parameters to\nthe spectra of these sources are listed in Table 2. Sources were detected down to a detection\nlimit of \u223c7 \u00d7 1038 ergs s\u22121 for 14 counts in a source above the background in the 0.2\u201310.0\nkeV band, for the EPIC MOS and 2.0 \u00d7 1038 ergs s\u22121 in PN observations, respectively.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- The XMM-Newton/MOS 1 image of NGC 5774/5775 with the positions of detected\nsources marked with circles of 10\u2032\u2032 .0 radius.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nFig. 5.- 25\u2032\u2032 \u00d725\u2032\u2032 SDSS 3-color images centered on the Chandra sources in the field of\nNGC 5774/5775. Colors are the same as used in Figure 1. North is up and east to the left.\nFor completeness, we analyzed archival ROSAT observations of NGC 5774/5775. A 6 ks\nPSPC observation was taken in July/August 1993 and a 35 ks HRI observation was taken in\nJuly 1997. No sources were detected in the PSPC data and only two sources (#5 and #26\nof Table 1) were detected in the HRI data. Count rates of these two sources were used to\nestimate their intrinsic fluxes and are listed in Table 2.\n\n2.2.\n\nOptical Photometric Observations\n\nPhotometric data of NGC 5774/5775 observed with the Hubble Space Telescope, the\nEuropean Southern Observatory's 3.5 m New Technology Telescope (NTT), and the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) program were obtained from their respective archives.\nA 640 s Hubble/WFPC2 observation of NGC 5774 was carried out on May 20, 2001\nusing the F814W filter. This observation covered only X-ray source s01 in Fig.2. Hubble astrometry was done using the USNO-B1.0 star 0935-0243054. Based on the absolute\npositional uncertainties of the USNO stars and the X-ray sources, we estimate that the astrometric accuracy was better than 0.\u2032\u2032 70. No counterpart to source #1 was detected in the\nHubble data.\nTwo Hubble/ACS\u2013WFC observations of NGC 5775 were carried out on August 21,\n2005 with F625W and F658N filters. Astrometry between Hubble/ACS\u2013WFC and Chandra\nimages were carried out using the source #26. Considering the centroiding uncertainties of\nthese images, the estimated astrometric accuracies were in the range of 0.\u2032\u2032 2 \u2013 0.\u2032\u2032 3.\nNGC 5774/5775 was observed with the ESO/NTT in H\u03b1 and R\u2013band filters on May\n07, 1991. Multiple short observations were taken in each filter. The total integration time\nfor the H\u03b1 filter (full-width at half-maximum =75 \u00c5) was 60 m, which reached to the rms\nnoise level of 7\u00d710\u221218 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 arcsec\u22122 (Lee et al. 2001). Photometric analysis of\nthese images were carried out using IRAF2 software. Astrometry between the ESO/NTT\nand Chandra images was done using two sources (#5 and 26), which are bright in both the\nimages.\nSDSS photometric (u, g, r, i, and z bands) images of the field and spectroscopic ob2\n\nIRAF is the Image Reduction and Analysis Facility, written and supported by the IRAF programming\ngroup at the National Optical Astronomy Observatories (NOAO) in Tucson, Arizona.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nservations of the nuclei of NGC 5774 and NGC 5775 were carried out on May 16, 2001.\nAstrometry was performed following the same procedure used for the ESO/NTT images.\nAstrometrically-corrected SDSS images (25\u2032\u2032 \u00d725\u2032\u2032 ), centered on the positions of the Chandra\nsources, are shown in Figure 5. The X-ray (0.5\u20138.0 keV) to optical (V band) flux ratios\n(FX /FO ) are given in column 9 of Table 1. When no candidate optical counterpart to an\nX-ray source is detected, then the value of the V band has been assumed to be 25 mag and\nthe corresponding lower limit values of FX /FO are listed in Table 1. SDSS detection limit\nin the V-band is 25 mag. For sources in confused region of NGC 5774/5775, no FX /FO is\ngiven.\nThere are 12 X-ray sources with potential counterparts in the SDSS images. Their\nproperties are listed in Table 3. Where objects are identified in the SDSS catalog, these\nmagnitudes are quoted. For sources, #9 and #26, magnitudes were estimated by fitting\nnormalized Gaussian profiles to the spatial distribution of counts in each filter image. Most\nof these objects lie outside the D25 isophotes of the galaxy pair. Three of the X-ray sources,\n#5, 23, and 26, are ULX candidates based on their X-ray flux and assuming they are at the\ndistance of NGC 5774/5775. An optical color-color diagram including these 12 sources is\ndisplayed in Figure 6. Usually, the nominal photometric accuracy of SDSS images is around\n0.03 mag for sources not limited by photon statistics (Ivezi\u0107 et al. 2004). However, some\nof the 12 sources are relatively faint and we estimated that the photometric accuracies in\n(u \u2212 g) and (g \u2212 r) colors will be approximately between 0.10 and 1.0 mag3 . Five sources\n(sources #5, 6, 9, 15, and 26) are located in a small region near the center in Figure 6.\nAs shown in \u00a7 2.3, optical spectra of sources #5 and 26 show they are background QSOs.\nThe (u \u2212 g) and (g \u2212 r) colors of these sources are consistent with being z < 3.0 SDSSQSOs (Richards et al. 2001). We conclude all five sources are likely background QSOs with\nredshifts less than 3 but only have strong spectroscopic evidence for this classification for\nsources #5 and 26.\n\n3\n\nhttp://www.sdss.org/dr4/start/aboutdr4.html\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.- (u-g) versus (g-r) plot of optical sources detected in the SDSS data at the astrometric corrected positions of Chandra sources. Long dashed line with arrows shows the\npositions of the source #25 and the associated galaxy at a redshift of 0.0953 (see text).\nThree objects located in the lower right hand region of Figure 6 could be globular clusters\n(GCs) based on their colors and absolute magnitudes (assuming they are at the distance of\nNGC 5774/5775) compared to those of Galactic and extragalactic GCs (e.g., Harris 1996;\nMiller et al. 1997; Lotz et al. 2004). Source #23 is in the halo of NGC 5775 and source #11\nin the halo of NGC 5774 so this identification is plausible. Source #11 is located close to\na background galaxy on the (u-g) versus (g-r) plot. However, source #11 is a point source.\nThus, we believe that it is a GC associated with NGC 5774. Source #2 is about 2 D25 radii\nfrom NGC 5774 and it may instead be an unrelated background source.\nSource #25 and 39 are peculiar in that their positions in the upper left of Figure 6 are\ndue to weak emission in the g band relative to the u and r bands.\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nWe reanalyzed the Sloan images of source #39 and find that the u band emission is\nsignificant only at about the 1 sigma level. Therefore we feel that the u band flux listed\nin the Sloan catalog is overestimated and that the tabulated colors are unreliable for this\nsource.\nSource #25 is located at the southern tip of what is clearly an elongated background\ngalaxy, SDSS J145355.82+033431.8 (Figure 5). Our interpretation of the Sloan image is that\nthe X-ray source is coincident with a blue color region different from the rest of this galaxy.\nThe SDSS color of the astrometric corrected X-ray position is located at the upper left in\nFigure 6. We were unable to improve on these color estimates but feel that they are not\nreliable because of the spatial overlap. We note that the colors of the background galaxy\ncenter (labeled \"Galaxy\" in Figure 6) alone is very close to the colors of source #11, which is\nreasonable in that the colors of the old stellar population of a galactic bulge at low redshift\nshould match the colors of a globular cluster.\nThe fact that source #25 is not at the center of the background galaxy suggests that\nit could be a very luminous ULX in that galaxy. The Sloan spectrum of this galaxy gives a\nredshift of 0.0953\u00b10.0002, which corresponds to a cosmology corrected luminosity distance of\n424 Mpc. The Galactic absorption corrected flux for the source #25 in the 0.2\u201310 keV band\n\u221215\nis 3.1+2.0\nergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 and the corresponding luminosity is \u223c6.7\u00d71040 ergs s\u22121 . The\n\u22121.1 \u00d7 10\nimmediate environment of this source in the host galaxy is blue, which can be seen from Fig.\n6. No HST data is available for this galaxy. To search for the optical counterpart of source\n#25, we added all the available R-band images obtained from ESO/NTT. Astrometric and\nphotometric studies were performed with the final image. No counterpart within the error\ncircle at the astrometric corrected Chandra position of source #25 was detected in this image,\nat the limit of 27.5 mag. This suggests that the X-ray to optical flux ratio (FX /FO ) is more\nthan 17. Absence of radio detections and such high value of FX /FO indicates that the source\n#25 is not a background AGN and most likely a bright ULX in SDSS J145355.82+033431.8.\nThe source #13 is weak and consequently has poorly-measured optical colors. Formally,\nthis source has colors similar to a star forming region but it is located far from any active\nstar forming region so this interpretation is doubtful.\nThe remaining source #17 has not been cataloged in the SDSS. Our measurements are\nlisted in Table 3 and shows that it is an extended object with extremely blue colors. This is\na blue compact dwarf galaxy.\nIn summary, of 12 optical sources spatially coincident with X-ray sources two could\nbe globular clusters (s11 and s23), one bright ULX (s25) in a background galaxy, one blue\ncompact dwarf galaxy (s17), six are likely background QSOs (s02, s05, s06, s09, s15 and\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\ns26), and two are too faint or too confused to identify with confidence (s13 and s39).\n\n2.3.\n\nOptical Spectroscopic Observations\n\nComparing Tables 1 and 3, we find three of the 15 ULX candidates (source #5, 23 and\n26) have potential optical counterparts. Sources #5 and 26 are brighter than 21 mag and\nwe obtained optical spectra of these two objects.\n\nFig. 7.- Optical spectrum of source#5 (at the source frame) obtained with the WHT using\nthe ISIS spectrograph. A strong emission line due to MgII \u03bb2798 \u00c5 from a background quasar\nat a redshift of 1.365 is shown. The strong absorption line is due to telluric absorption in the\nEarth's atmosphere (top panel). Bottom panel shows the spectrum of source#26 obtained\nwith the DOLORES spectrograph at the 3.6 m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo telescope. This\nis the spectrum of a background quasar at a redshift of 0.661.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nThe optical spectrum of source #5 was obtained on January 2004 with the William\nHerschel Telescope (WHT)4 using the red arm of the ISIS spectrograph and the R158R grism\nduring an 1800 s exposure. The slit width was between 1.\u2032\u2032 20 and 1.\u2032\u2032 45. Cu\u2013Ar and Cu\u2013Ne\nlamps were used for wavelength calibration. This provides a sampling of 1.62 \u00c5 pixel\u22121\nand an effective resolution of 8\u201310 \u00c5 (depending on the slit width used and on atmospheric\nseeing). The spectrum was analyzed following a standard procedure using IRAF software\nthat comprises bias subtraction, extraction of the spectra, and wavelength calibration. We\nused the standard spectroscopic stars Feige 67 (Oke 1990), and BD+26 2606 (Oke & Gunn\n1983) to correct approximately for the response of the configuration to different wavelengths.\nGiven the prohibitive time needed to obtain flat-field images (especially in the blue part of the\nspectrum), we did not correct for that effect. However, we have checked that this correction\nwould have been very small (\u2264 1 %) and would not have affected any of the identifications\nof the main spectral features reported here. The spectrum of source #5 is shown in the\ntop panel of Figure 7. A strong MgII \u03bb2798 \u00c5 emission line and a weak emission line of O\nII \u03bb3727 \u00c5 are present in this spectrum. From these emission-lines we determine that this\nobject is a background quasar at a redshift of 1.365.\n4\n\nThe William Herschel Telescope is operated by the Isaac Newton Group and the IAC in Spain's Roque\nde los Muchachos Observatory. The observations were done in service time.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n\nFig. 8.- Optical spectrum of source#26, determined to be a background quasar at a redshift\nof 0.6606. The circled crosses near \u03bb\u03bb6900 and 7200 \u00c5 denote the positions of strong telluric\nabsorption in the Earth's atmosphere. The spectrum is smoothed with a boxcar of 11 pixels\nfor display purposes.\nThe optical spectrum of source #26 was obtained with the 3.6 m Telescopio Nazionale\nGalileo (TNG) telescope on June 2005. A single exposure of 1800 s with a slit of 2\u2032\u2032 using\nthe DOLORES spectrograph and the MR-B grism was taken. For wavelength calibration we\nused He and Ar lamps. The spectrum was reduced according to standard procedure within\nIRAF as mentioned above. The spectrum is displayed in the bottom panel of Figure 7. It is\na background quasar at a redshift of 0.661 based on the MgII \u03bb2798 \u00c5 emission line.\nA second spectrum of source #26 was obtained at the ESO 3.6 m telescope using the\nESO Faint Object Spectrograph (EFOSC2) on June 6th, 2005. The grism Gr#13 was used,\nproviding a dispersion of \u223c 2.77 \u00c5 pix\u22121 with a wavelength coverage between 3720 and 9330\n\u00c5. Two spectra of this source were obtained with an exposure time of 1800 s each and a\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nsignal-to-noise ratio of about 5-10. They were reduced using standard IRAF tasks, shifted\nto the heliocentric rest-frame and flux-calibrated with a spectrophotometric standard star.\nThe spectral resolution is 440 at the central wavelength (6530 \u00c5 5.4 pixel element). Some\nfringing is present at the level of \u223c5-10 % at wavelength long ward of 8000 \u00c5. The Mg II\n\u03bb2798 \u00c5 as well as Balmer lines H\u03b2 \u03bb4861 \u00c5 and H\u03b3 \u03bb4342 \u00c5 are seen, as are forbidden lines\nof O and Ne. While Mg II is clearly broad, with a FWHM \u2248 5300 km s\u22121 , H\u03b2 is narrow,\nwith a FWHM of only 400 km s\u22121 , similar to the forbidden line widths. However, most of\nthe the narrow lines are either weak or affected by systematic effects such as fringing, and\nthe typical error in the measurement of their width is about 40 per cent. This spectrum is\nshown in Figure 8.\nThe SDSS obtained optical spectra of the nuclear regions (circle of 3\u2032\u2032 radius corresponding to the size of the SDSS fiber) of NGC 5774 and NGC 5775. The only strong emission lines\npresent in the nuclear spectrum of NGC 5774 are H\u03b1, [Nii] \u03bb6583\u00c5, and [Sii] \u03bb6725\u00c5. The\nintensity ratios of these lines suggest that the emission is from normal Hii regions (Ho et al.\n1993). The nuclear optical spectrum of NGC 5775 is much redder than that of NGC 5774,\nas anticipated by the high inclination of NGC 5775, but the spectrum is otherwise similar to\nthat of NGC 5774 with relatively weaker emission lines. No nuclear point source is detected\nin the Chandra image of either galaxy to a limiting luminosity of 3\u00d71037 ergs s \u22121 . Thus,\nwe conclude that these galaxies do not host active nuclei.\n\n2.4.\n\nInfrared & Radio Observations\n\nThe only counterpart to an X-ray source detected in the infrared Two Micron All Sky\nSurvey (2MASS) data is source #5. Its J, H, and K magnitudes are 17.0\u00b11.4 mag, 16.7\u00b11.6\nmag and 15.8\u00b11.8 mag, respectively. These colors are consistent with the quasar interpretation for this source (Cutri et al. 2002).\nThe NRAO Very Large Array \u2013 Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters\n(VLA\u2013FIRST, Becker, White & Helfand 1995) image of NGC 5774/5775 field is shown in\nFigure 9. Only source #47 has a potential counterpart in this image. Its radio peak fluxdensity is (2.94\u00b10.15) mJy beam\u22121 . We also queried the positions of ULX candidates in the\nNRAO Very Large Array Sky Survey (NVSS and FIRST were operated at 1.4 GHz, Condon,\net al. 1998) and no source was detected. This is expected, because the limiting peak source\nbrightness of NVSS was about 2.5 mJy beam\u22121 (Condon, et al. 1998).\nRadio observations of the NGC 5774 / 5775 galaxy pair were carried out using the\nAustralia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) in January 2005. The continuum observations\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\n(over a time-slot of 7 hours) were made at all four frequencies 1.4, 2.3, 4.8 and 8.4 GHz by\nalternately observing at 1.4/2.3 GHz and 4.8/8.4 GHz frequency pair using turret rotation.\nThe array used for the observations was 1.5D. The synthesized beams are elongated in\ndeclination as a consequence of the northern declination of the source and hence only the\nresults for the higher frequency pair have been considered. The data at the two frequencies\nwere reduced using standard procedure within the MIRIAD package (Sault, Teuben & Write\n1995; Sault & Killeen 1998). The quoted fluxes are from the cleaned and primary beam\ncorrected images at the two frequencies. The rms noise achieved at 4.8 GHz and 8.4 GHz\nwas respectively 0.21 and 0.06 mJy and the synthesized beams were 2.4\" \u00d7 35\" and 2\"\n\u00d7 17\". We have detected radio emissions from sources #19, 47 and 49, with peak flux\u2013\ndensities of 1.58, 0.68 and 1.12 mJy beam\u22121 , respectively, at 4.8 GHz with a typical rms of\n0.40 mJy. These results can be compared with results of the VLA\u2013FIRST. However, it must\nbe mentioned that the AT CA and the VLA\u2013FIRST measurements were made using two\ndifferent instruments with different calibration, imaging and analysis methods. In addition,\n1.4 and 4.8 GHz frequencies were used for the VLA\u2013FIRST and the AT CA observations of\nNGC 5774/5775 respectively. Thus, it is important that we compare the peak flux densities\nat a common frequency, say at 1.4 GHz. To convert the AT CA peak flux densities (S\u03bd )\nfrom 4.8 GHz to 1.4 GHz, we need to know the value of radio spectral index. Results of\nradio observations of ULXs suggest that the values of radio spectral indices (\u03b1) are in the\nrange of 0.4 to 1.2, where S\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u2212\u03b1 (Neff, Ulvestad & Campion 2003; Kaaret et al. 2003;\nKording, Colbert & Falcke 2005; Miller, Mushotzky & Neff 2005; Soria et al. 2006; Lang\net al. 2007). We have used the conservative-value of \u03b1 as 0.5 and the estimated 1.4 GHz\npeak flux densities for sources #19, 47 and 49 are 2.95\u00b10.56, 1.24\u00b10.56, and 2.08\u00b10.56 mJy,\nrespectively. Comparison of these results with that of the VLA\u2013FIRST results suggest that\nthe 1.4 GHz peak flux densities of these three sources varied by (2.95-0.15)\u00b10.58, (2.941.24)\u00b10.58 and (2.08-0.15)\u00b10.58 mJy, respectively, where 0.15 mJy is the typical rms of\nthe VLA\u2013FIRST observations. Considering the large uncertainties, which were computed\nthrough the propagation of errors, we find that sources# 19 and 49 were variable at or\nabove the three sigma level. Even though these two sources appear variable, but these\nresults should be taken cautiously because of the differences between the VLA\u2013FIRST and\nthe AT CA observations and analysis procedures. However, it should be emphasized that\nwhether sources #19, 47 and 49 are radio variable or not, but they are radio emitters.\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\n\nFig. 9.- The VLA-FIRST image of NGC 5774/5775 with D25 isophotes. Three circles of\nradius 10\u2032\u2032 are also shown at the positions of three sources detected with ATCA.\n\n3.\n\nDiscussion\n\nRadio through X-ray observations of the interacting pair of galaxies, NGC 5774/5775,\nhave enabled a detail investigation of the dynamical, morphological and spatial properties\nof this system.\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\n3.1.\n\nThe cumulative X-ray luminosity function\n\nThere are eight (excluding the AGN, s05) X-ray sources in NGC 5774. Grimm, Gilfanov,\n& Sunyaev (2003a) proposed a universal cumulative X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of\nhigh-mass X-ray binaries (HMXRBs), suggesting a normalization factors (NF) proportional\nto the star formation rate (SFR) of a galaxy. Thus, the formalism of Grimm, Gilfanov, &\nSunyaev (2003a) would predict only one HMXRB in NGC 5774 with 2\u201310 keV luminosity\n\u223c1.78\u00b10.3) \u00d7 1038 ergs s\u22121 . This is extremely small compared to the observed total X-ray\nluminosity of the eight point sources of NGC 5774, which is (6.85\u00b10.39) \u00d7 1039 ergs s\u22121\n(Table 1). Such huge discrepancy may be due to the non-linear relation between the total\nluminosity of HMXRBs and the low-SFR of NGC 5774 (Grimm, Gilfanov, & Sunyaev 2003a).\nNGC 5774 has a low SFR of 0.2 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , but the presence of three ULXs and five other\nX-ray binaries is remarkable. Using the mass and the SFR of NGC 5774 and Equation (4)\nof Colbert et al. (2004) we can determine the total point-source X-ray luminosity of this\ngalaxy, which is (4.15\u00b10.5) \u00d7 1039 ergs s\u22121 . This is comparable to the observed value and\nsuggests that the X-ray source population of NGC 5774 consists of the older stellar population\n(including low mass X-ray binaries) and the younger stellar population (including HMXBs),\nwhich are directly related to the mass and SFR of NGC 5774 (Colbert et al. 2004; Grimm,\nGilfanov, & Sunyaev 2003b). Three ULXs of NGC 5774 are located in active starforming\nregions on the spiral arms of this galaxy. This indicates that the formation of ULXs strongly\ndepends on its immediate local environment but not on the global properties of the host\ngalaxy.\nTwenty four X-ray sources (excluding the AGN, s26) are detected in NGC 5775. Observed counts of these twenty four sources are plotted against the cumulative number of\nsources in Fig. 10. It can be seen from this figure that the XLF of the starburst galaxy\nNGC 5775 is best represented as a single powerlaw (slope=\u22120.71) whereas the XLF of all the\nsources studied requires a broken powerlaw with a steeper slope at high flux. For NGC 5774,\nboth a single and a broken powerlaw provide acceptable fits (there are too few sources to differentiate) but the slope of the single powerlaw is \u22120.82, steeper than that of NGC 5775. The\nvalue of the slope of the XLF of NGC 5775 is consistent with the mean values of -0.65\u00b10.16\nfor the interacting/merging and -0.79\u00b10.24 for spirals (Colbert et al. 2004). The XLFs of\nX-ray sources in spiral galaxies with moderate star formation rates are relatively flat (e.g.,\nKilgard et al. 2002; Colbert et al. 2004), which means that the most luminous individual\nsources dominate the total X-ray luminosity (LX ) from these galaxies (Grimm, Gilfanov, &\nSunyaev 2003b). Comparison of XLFs between NGC 5775 and interacting/merging galaxies\nshows that their slopes are also around -0.70 with a dispersion of 0.2, even though they have\ndifferent star formation rates (SFRs) [M82 (Kaaret et al. 2001), NGC 253 (Strickland et al.\n2000), NGC 3256 (Lira et al. 2002), NGC 3395/3396 (Brassington, Read & Ponman 2005),\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\nNGC 4485/4490 (Roberts et al. 2002), The Mice (Read 2003), The Antennae (Fabbiano et\nal. 2001), The Cartwheel Ring Galaxy (Gao, Wang, Appleton & Lucas 2003)]. However,\nit may be noted that the normalization factors (NFs) of respective XLFs are different for\nthese galaxies. Here we would like to mention that the number of sources detected above\n2\u00d71038 ergs s\u22121 in NGC 5775, are consistent with the number of HMXRBs predicted by the\nuniversal XLF of Grimm, Gilfanov, & Sunyaev (2003a). Thus, the XLFs with same slopes\nbut different NFs indicate for evolutionary stages of galaxies. For example, comparison of\nXLFs between NGC 5775 and The Antennae or NGC4485/4490 shows that these galaxies\nhave similar spectral slopes but the NF values are large for The Antennae or NGC 4485/4490.\nThese results suggest that The Antennae or NGC 4485/4490 are more evolved than that of\nNGC 5775. This is independently supported by the radio results, which suggest that the\nstar formation in NGC 5775 was triggered by an encounter between the two galaxies some\n100 Myr ago (Irwin 1994).\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\nFig. 10.- The X-ray luminosity functions of Chandra sources is shown for all sources in 6'.6\n\u00d75'.8 field (solid histogram) and for sources in NGC 5775 (dotted histogram), NGC 5774\n(dot-dashed histogram), and outside these galaxies (dashed histogram). Also shown is the\nbest-fit single powerlaw model (slope -0.71) to the luminosity function of NGC 5775 and\nbroken-powerlaw fit to all the sources.\n\n3.2.\n\nStarburst activities\n\nSDSS obtained optical spectra of the nuclear regions (circle of 3\u2032\u2032 radius corresponding\nto the size of the SDSS fiber) of NGC 5774 on May 16, 2001. The only strong emission\nlines present in the nuclear spectrum of NGC 5774 are H\u03b1, [Nii] \u03bb6583\u00c5, and [Sii] \u03bb6725\u00c5.\nThe intensity ratios of [Nii] \u03bb6583/H\u03b1 is less than 0.6. This suggests that the emissionlines are formed in the nuclear Hii regions (Veileus & Osterbrock 1987; Ho et al. 1993;\n1997). No nuclear point source is detected in the Chandra image of this galaxy to a limiting\nluminosity of 3\u00d71037 ergs s \u22121 . Source # 3 (s03) is close to the optical center, but the\nastrometric corrected Chandra position of s03 is \u223c10.\u2032\u2032 0 away from the optical nucleus.\nThus, we conclude that this galaxy does not host active nucleus to a limiting luminosity of\n3\u00d71037 ergs s \u22121 . SDSS spectrum of the nuclear region of NGC 5775 is much redder than\nthat of NGC 5774, as anticipated by the high inclination of NGC 5775, but the spectrum\nis otherwise similar to that of NGC 5774 with relatively weaker emission lines. No nuclear\npoint source is detected in the Chandra image of this galaxy to a limiting luminosity of\n3\u00d71037 ergs s \u22121 . Thus, again we conclude that this galaxy also does not host active nucleus.\nWe extracted the X-ray spectrum of the diffuse emission from the D25 region, excluding\nthe point sources. The spectrum was binned to obtain at least 20 counts per fitting bin.\nA corresponding background spectrum was extracted from an ellipse of twice the D25 area\nfrom a source-free region of the same CCD. Absorbed single powerlaw model does not fit well\n2\nwith this spectrum (NH consistent with the Galactic value and \u0393= 3.2+0.83\n\u22120.37 for \u03c7 =91.2 for 67\ndegrees of freedom). Similarly, absorbed single component thermal models like blackbody,\nmekal, bremstrahlung, disk blackbody, etc., fit poorly with this spectrum. Finally, we find\nthat absorbed mekal plus powerlaw model fits well with the diffuse gas spectrum of NGC 5775\n(\u03c72 =65.2 for 65 degrees of freedom). The spectrum of diffuse gas, model and residuals are\nshown in Fig. 11. In this model NH was required to freeze with the Galactic value. The\nmekal temperature and abundance values are \u223c0.31\u00b10.04 keV and 0.05+0.20\n\u22120.03 , respectively.\n+0.68\nPhoton index of the powerlaw component is 1.75\u22120.51 . From the X-ray spectral fits of the\ndiffuse gas, we have found that the fluxes from the mekal and the powerlaw components\nare 2.6\u00b10.7 and 5.4\u00b11.5\u00d710\u221214 ergs s\u22121 in the 0.5\u20138.0 keV band, respectively. Parameters\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\nof the mekal component can be used to compute different parameters (emission measure,\nparticle number density, total gas mass, thermal energy, cooling time, etc.) to determine\nthe physical properties of the diffuse gas. However, large uncertainties of the volume-filling\nfactor will introduce huge errors in the values of these parameters (Strickland & Stevens\n2000). Instead, we will use the star formation rate to determine the origin of the diffuse gas.\nThe temperature of the diffuse gas is slightly lower than the expected diffuse gas temperature\nof \u223c0.5\u00b10.07 keV detected in interacting galaxies (Read & Ponman 1998). This indicates\nthat NGC 5775 is in early phase of interaction. The value of the abundance from the mekal\nmodel suggest that the metallicity of the diffuse gas is sub-solar. Kewley, Geller, & Barton\n(2005) have shown that the metallicity of gas in the central regions of starburst galaxies\nin pairs like NGC 5774/5775 tends to be sub-solar. They attribute this to channeling of\nmetal-poor fuel from the outskirts of the galaxies toward the central star-forming regions.\nMost likely, the NW and SE bridges are transporting outer-materials into NGC 5775 and\nthus we expect the diffuse gas of this galaxy to be composed of sub-solar materials.\nWe have detected outflow from the central region of NGC 5775, which is shown in\nFig. 12. The observed outflow may be the starburst-driven superwinds from the starburst\ngalaxy, NGC 5775. This indicates that NGC 5775 is in the superwind phase, which can be\nused as tool to study its evolutionary process. Comparison of the observed results with the\npost-starburst evolutionary model results of Taniguchi et al. (2000) suggest that NGC 5775\nhave gone through both the starburst phase and the early-B star phase and entered into the\nsuperwind phase. This means that the wide-spread starformation took place around 2\u00d7107 yr\nago (Taniguchi et al. 2000). This is consistent with the estimated age of the interaction from\ndynamical considerations (Irwin 1994). In addition, these results are also consistent with the\nindependent results derived from the studies of XLF and the X-ray spectrum of the diffuse\ngas of NGC 5775.\nThe fact that star formation is occurring throughout the disk of NGC 5775 yet there\nis very little visible distribution of the disk/spiral structure of the galaxy pair indicating\nthat the starburst in NGC 5775 is triggered by tidal forces redistributing the gas within the\ngalaxy disk rather than by gas transfer between the galaxies. Thus, the hot diffuse gas was\nproduced during the wide-spread starformation episodes in NGC 5775 and is proceeding at\na rate of 5.4 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . Diffuse gas has two origins: thermal and non-thermal. Thermal\ncomponent is due to supernova remnants (SNRs) and stellar winds. Contributions from\nSNRs can be computed using a relationship between the far infrared (FIR) luminosity and\nthe supernova rate of starburst galaxies, which is as follows (Mattila & Meikle 2001):\nrSN = 2.7 \u00d7 10\u221212 LF IR /L\u2299 yr\u22121 ,\n\n(1)\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\nThe FIR luminosity (LF IR ) of NGC 5775 is 3.14\u00d71010 L\u2299 (Devereux & Eales 1989), which\ncorresponds to 0.084 SN per year. Thus, 1.7 \u00d7 106 SNe exploded during the interval of\n2\u00d7107 yr. If we assume that a massive star evolves to explode into a SN in 107 yr and\n1051 ergs is released from each SN explosion, then total thermal energy associated with\nthe diffuse gas of NGC 5775 will be 1.7\u00d71057 ergs. In addition, there will be some more\ncontribution to the thermal energy from stellar winds. Of course, part of the total thermal\nenergy will be lost due to radiative processes, gravitational potential energy and kinetic\nenergy of the galactic wind/outflow. Large fraction of the thermal energy will be dissipated\nduring the superwind phase of NGC 5775, which may last \u223c 8 \u00d7 107 yr (Taniguchi et al.\n2000).\nResults of the spectral fitting show that the powerlaw component contributes more than\ndouble to the diffuse gas compared to the mekal component. Powerlaw sources are most\nlikely unresolved X-ray binaries plus x-ray emitting stars. In addition, we find that the total\ndiffuse gas contributes less than \u223c5.0% to the total X-ray luminosity of NGC 5775. These\nresults along with the non-detection of the nuclear source plus detection of the galactic\nwind suggest that NGC 5775 is in the beginning of the evolutionary process similar to\nNGC 3395/3396 (Brassington, Read & Ponman 2005). This is further supported by the\nevolutionary model of Taniguchi et al. (2000), which suggests that, presently, NGC 5775 is\nin the superwind phase and after spending \u223c 8\u00d7107 yr this galaxy will enter into the LINER\nphase (Taniguchi et al. 2000). However, it may be mentioned that the evolutionary stage of\nNGC 5775 is determined based on the evolutionary models of Taniguchi et al. (2000), which\nhave been constructed to explain the optical narrow emission-lines. These models are yet to\nbe examined with the multiwavelength properties of starburst galaxies. Thus, presently, we\nare not certain about the evolutionary tracks of these models and the evolutionary results\nof NGC 5775, present here, should be taken cautiously.\n\n\f0.01\n10\u22123\n10\u22124\n0.01 0.02\n0\n\nResiduals\n\nNormalized counts s\u22121 keV\u22121\n\n\u2013 29 \u2013\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n5\n\nChannel Energy (keV)\n\nFig. 11.- Upper panel shows the Chandra spectrum of diffuse gas in D25 region of NGC 5775,\nwhich is fitted with the absorbed mekal plus powerlaw model with NH fixed at the Galactic\nvalue, 3.47 x 1020 cm\u22122 .

We know that source #25 is associated with a background galaxy.\nSources #14 and 16 have no optical counterparts and are most likely not background AGNs.\nMost likely, they are HMXRBs. It appears that source #16 is probably associated with the\nhalo of NGC 5775. Thus, we conclude that source #14 is an HMXRB located on the NWbridge. Similarly, we find that sources #6, 10, 15, 18, and 23 are located on the SE-bridge.\nBased on the optical colors, sources #6 and 15 are possible background AGNs. Source #23\nis a potential globular cluster (Fig.6 and section 2.2). No objects brighter than 25 mag in the\nV -band are present within the error circles at the astrometric corrected Chandra positions\nof sources #10 and 18. Both the sources #18, and 23 are located very close to the D25\nisophote of the edge-on galaxy, NGC 5775. Thus, we suggest that they are most likely the\nhalo-objects of NGC 5775. Finally, we are left with two sources - s10 and s14, which are\naround 2 \u00d7 1037 ergs s \u22121 and are probably HMXRBs formed on the SE- and NW-bridges,\nrespectively. Presence of these objects provide evidence for recent starformation on the\nbridges that might have been initiated by the interaction between the galaxy pair (Smith et\nal. 2007). Sources #18, and 23 are ULX candidates. Chandra spectra of these two ULX\ncandidates can be described by the powerlaw model (Table 1). The X-ray to optical flux\n\n\f\u2013 31 \u2013\nratio (FX /FO ) is larger than 13 for source #18 and source #23 is hosted in a globular cluster.\nSources #2, 13, 17, 19, 29, 39 and 48 are within the field but they are located neither on\nthe bridges nor within the D25 isophotes of two galaxies. Properties of sources #2, 13 and\n39 are discussed in section 2.2. Source #17 is associated with a blue compact dwarf galaxy\n(Fig. 5), which contains large clusters of young, hot and massive stars . Radio emission\nwas detected from source #19 and most likely this is a B L Lac object. We could not\ndetect the optical counterparts of source #29 and 48 and they are close to D25 isophote of\nNGC 5775 and they are most likely HMXRBs in the halo of this galaxy. However, it should\nbe mentioned that hydrodynamical simulations of interacting galaxies suggest that the gas\nin the connecting bridges is shocked or compressed due to interaction, which triggers widespread starformation episode and some gas may fall onto the outer disk (Struck & Smith\n2003). If this is true, then we would expect many X-ray sources to form at the interface of\nthe disk and bridges. Thus, the halo-objects of NGC 5775 (s16, s18 and s23), which are also\nlocated at the interface of the disk and bridges, might have formed due to the interaction\nbetween the outer disk and the falling gas from the bridges.\n\n3.4.\n\nNature of the ULXs\n\nIn this section, we describe interesting individual sources in some detail, particularly the\nmost luminous X-ray sources which are candidate ULXs. In total, forty-nine sources were\ndetected in two X-ray observations within the 6.\u2032 6\u00d75.\u2032 8 field (Figs. 1 and 2) above a detection\nlimit of \u223c1038 ergs s\u22121 . Nine X-ray sources were detected near or within the D25 isophote of\nNGC 5774. There are 25 X-ray sources within the D25 isophote of NGC 5775. Rest fifteen\nsources were also detected within the field but they were out side the D25 isophotes of these\ngalaxies. Properties of these fifteen objects have already been discussed in sections 2.2 and\n3.3. Here we will discuss about the candidate ULXs detected within the D25 isophotes of\nNGC 5774 and NGC 5775. Due to the large amounts of unresolved optical emission from\nthe disk of NGC 5775 and its nearly edge-on orientation, identification of potential optical\ncounterparts to the detected X-ray sources cannot be made for all the sources with high\nconfidence. Thus, we concentrate mainly on the X-ray properties of the sources in most\ncases.\nIn 1996, a bright supernova was detected in NGC 5775, SN 1996ae (Vagnozzi et al.\n1996). We used the Chandra and XMM-Newtom data to search for X-ray emissions from\nSN 1996ae. No source was detected at the location of this supernova. A two sigma upper\nlimit of 2 x 1037 ergs s\u22121 was determined.\n\n\f\u2013 32 \u2013\nBefore we switch over to candidate ULXs, we have to determine the possible foreground/background objects, which mimic as ULXs. Since the value of FX /FO for foreground\nstars will be less than 0.1 and that for AGNs is of order unity (e.g., Green et al. 2004),\nthe brightest X-ray sources with optically bright counterparts are very likely either Galactic\nstars or high-redshift AGNs. The flux from a ULX (LX > 1039 ergs s\u22121 ) at the distance of\nNGC 5774/5775 is 8.4\u00d710\u221215 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the 2\u201310 keV bandpass assuming a \u0393 = 1.8\npower law spectrum and an absorption column density equal to the Galactic value. We\nexpect 3 background sources at or above this flux level within the 6.\u2032 6\u00d75.\u2032 8 field analyzed\nhere, according to the log(N)\u2013log(S) relation deduced from the Chandra Deep Field South\nsurvey (Rosati et al. 2002). Two ULX candidates with bright optical counterparts lying at\nor just beyond the D25 isophotes of the NGC 5774/5775 galaxy pair have spectroscopicallyconfirmed redshifts higher than that to the galaxy pair. Discovery of high redshifts to ULX\ncandidates outside the optical extent of target galaxies is now a common occurence (e.g.,\nArp, Guti\u00e9rrez, & L\u00f3pez-Corredoira 2004; Guti\u00e9rrez & L\u00f3pez-Corredoira 2005; Guti\u00e9rrez\n2006) and agrees with the statistical evidence that the radial distribution of ULXs in galaxies asymptotically approaches the expected background level at roughly the radius of the D25\nisophote (Swartz et al. 2004; Swartz 2006). Based on the SDSS-colors, we have identified\ns06, s09, s13 and s15 are likely background AGNs. The two ULX candidates, s18 and s23,\nhave already been discussed in section 3.3 and will not be repeated here. Finally, we are\nleft with three and seven candidate ULXs in NGC 5774 and NGC 5775, respectively. These\nten objects will be described in the following section. SDSS images of individual sources,\ntheir Chandra spectra and spectral results are presented in Fig. 5, Fig. 3 and Table 1,\nrespectively.\n\n3.4.1. Source #1\nThe Chandra light curve of source # 1 displayed significant variability. Its X-ray light\ncurve is shown in Figure 13. Assuming a constant count rate results in a value of \u03c72 of 85.7\nfor 58 degrees of freedom and a KS probability < 10\u22125 . The Chandra spectrum of this ULX\ncandidate can be described as an absorbed powerlaw. This source was not detected during\nthe XMM\u2013Newton observations. We queried at the astrometric corrected Chandra position\nof this source and the derived value of LX is \u223c 7.7 \u00d7 1038 ergs s \u22121 in the 0.5-8 keV band.\nComparison of this value with that of Chandra, listed in Table 1, shows that it varied by a\nfactor of three between these two observations separated by around 15 months.\nHST/WFPC2 image in F814W filter was used to search for the optical counterpart of\nsource # 1. The astrometry between the Chandra and the HST images were performed using\n\n\f\u2013 33 \u2013\nthe USNO-B1.0 star 0935-0243054 and the estimated astrometric error is \u223c0.\u2032\u2032 70. No optical\ncounterpart was detected within the error circle at the astrometrically-corrected Chandra\nposition of the X-ray source, to the limiting magnitude of \u223c26 mag. The source is located\non the spiral arm and also within a star forming complex. The Hubble image shows many\nbright knots near this ULX candidate that are also apparent in the SDSS composite image.\nDespite the lack of an optical counterpart, this source is similar in the X-ray temporal\nand spectral behavior to the transient ULX in Cen A that has been attributed to a Be/X-ray\nbinary (Ghosh et al. 2006). At the distance to NGC 5774, a late O or early B companion to\nsource #1 would not be detectable even with Hubble.\n\nFig. 13.- Chandra light curve of source # 1 with 1000 s binning.\n\n\f\u2013 34 \u2013\n3.4.2. Source #4\nThis source was detected with Chandra but was absent at the 2\u03c3 detection limit of \u223c3 \u00d7\n10 ergs s\u22121 during the XMM-Newton/PN observation. This source falls near the Chandra\nCCD gap, which suggest that it was probably more luminous during the Chandra observation\nthan that listed in Table 1. Its Chandra spectrum is described with the powerlaw model.\nKS-test probability of \u223c0.001 indicates it was variable during the Chandra observation.\nSource #4 is located at the inner portion of the inner spiral arm of NGC 5774. Close\ninspection of the SDSS image shows the presence of uniformly distributed diffuse emission\nat and around the astrometric-corrected Chandra position of this ULX candidate. The\nESO/NTT H\u03b1 image shows that this source is located at an elongated diffuse emission\nregion. It being a X-ray variable object, we suggest that the diffuse emission is a nebula\nformed by the injection of kinetic energy by a jet from this ULX.\n38\n\n3.4.3. Source #12\nThis source lies just beyond the D25 isophote of NGC 5774 but is located on the spiral\narm of this galaxy (see Figure 1). Eventhough this source was not detected with XMMNewton but the extracted source countrate suggest that it is not a transient X-ray source.\nIt is not a highly absorbed source and its Chandra spectrum suggest that it may be a flat\nspectrum object. No optical counterpart was detected in the ESO/NTT H\u03b1, R-band and\nSDSS images.\n\n3.4.4. Source #24\nSource # 24 was bright (LX \u223c 7.78\u00b10.32 \u00d71039 ergs s \u22121 in the 0.5-8 keV band) during\nthe Chandra observation but not detected in the XMM-Newton data with a 2\u03c3 detection\nupper limit of 5.6\u00d71038 ergs s\u22121 in the 0.2-10 keV band. This shows that it varied by more\nthan a factor of 10 between the two observations i.e. over a period of 15 months. However,\nit was steady during the interval of Chandra observation. Chandra spectrum of this source\nfitted with an absorbed powerlaw model is shown in Figure 3 and the spectral parameters\nare listed in Table 1. Residuals between the data and the model are shown in the lower panel\nof Figure 3. It can be seen from the residual plot that an emission feature around 3 keV is\npresent in the spectrum of this absorbed and flat powerlaw object. We added a Gaussian\nemission-line component to the powerlaw model to fit the Chandra spectrum. From the\nfit parameters, we find that \u2206\u03c72 =7.2 for 18 d.o.f and the F-test statistic and probability\n\n\f\u2013 35 \u2013\nvalues are 5.92 and 0.0054, respectively, which suggest that the detection of the line at\n2.99 keV (width=0.16 keV and equivalent width is 541 eV) is significant at \u223c99.5% level.\nIt is important to mention that it is a flat powerlaw object (\u0393=1.26+0.60\n\u22120.30 ). Figure 14 shows\nthe HST /ACS/W F C H\u03b1 (F658N) image of the region surrounding this ULX candidate.\nA circle of 0.\u2032\u2032 2 radius, which is the size of the error circle, is also shown. It may be seen\nthat this source is located within the diffuse H\u03b1 emission region and close (\u223c39 pc) to an\nobject of absolute magnitude around -12.2 mag in the F625W filter. This object may be a\nyoung star cluster, because most of the Hii regions are much brighter than this object (Lee\net al. 2001). In fact, the error circle covers part of this star cluster, suggesting that this\nULX candidate is associated with this star cluster.\nFlat powerlaws have been detected in the low/hard state spectra of Galactic black hole\nX-ray binaries (McClintock & Remillard 2006). In this state, the accretion rate is subEddington and compact radio jets may be present. In addition, radio and X-ray intensities\nare correlated (McClintock & Remillard 2006; Remillard & McClintock 2006). Thus, it\nis believed that X-ray beaming is absent and X-ray emission-lines can be detected in this\nlow/hard state (Remillard & McClintock 2006). Flat powerlaw and the presence of a broad\n(\u223c0.16 keV) emission line at 2.99 keV (Ca XX) in the Chandra spectrum of this ULX\nsuggest that beaming was not present in source #24 and it was in low/hard state during\nthe Chandra observations. If we assume that its observed X-ray luminosity was due to\nisotropic emission at the sub-Eddington (\u223c0.02\u00d7LEdd ) rate, then the mass of the accretor is\n\u223c3000 M\u2299 . It entered into further lower flux level during the XMM-Newton observations.\nSuch dramatic variation indicates that the accretion disk temperature at the outer edge was\nbelow the hydrogen ionization temperature. This can happen when the mass transfer rate\nfalls below a critical value and the mass of the accretor will be much higher than those of\nstellar-mass black holes, if the companion is a high-mass star (King et al. 1996). Source #24\nbeing located in the star forming region and most likely hosted in a young star cluster, it\nis expected that its companion will be a high-mass star. Thus, source #24 is a prospective\nintermediate mass black hole (IMBH) candidate.\n\n\f\u2013 36 \u2013\n\nFig. 14.- HST /ACS/W F C H\u03b1 (F658N) image around the astrometric-corrected Chandra\nposition of source #24. A circle of radius 0.\"2 marks the position of the X-ray source.\n\n3.4.5. Source #28\nSource # 28 was detected during the Chandra observation but was below the detection\nlevel in the XMM-Newton data. Chandra spectrum of this source displays a narrow emission\nfeature around 1.4 keV (Figure 3). This feature causes a poor fit statistic (\u03c72 =15.5 for 8\ndegrees of freedom) for source # 28 using a powerlaw-only model. Adding a Gaussian\nemission-line model improves \u03c72 by 9.8 (F-test value is 5.22). The resulting equivalent width\nof this line is 534 \u00b1 200 eV and the detection of this line is significant at the 95.1% level.\nThe line center is 1.44\u00b10.08 eV, which is most likely due to Mg XII with an outflow velocity\nof around 1500 km s\u22121 . No optical counterpart was detected within the error circle of radius\n0.\u2032\u2032 2 at the astrometric corrected Chandra position of this source.\n\n3.4.6. Source #40\nIt is the brightest ULX candidate (7.6\u00b10.7 \u00d7 1040 ergs s \u22121 in the 0.5-8 keV band)\namong 82 nearby galaxies in the survey of ULXs described in Swartz et al. (2004). It was\nnot detected by XMM-Newton with a 2\u03c3 detection upper limit of 3.5\u00d71038 ergs s\u22121 . The 2\u201310\n\n\f\u2013 37 \u2013\nkeV flux did not vary, but the 0.2 - 2 keV light curve, shown in Figure 15, indicates for possible\nvariability during the Chandra observation (\u03c72 /dof \u223c75/58). This type of variability was\nnot detected in any of the sources of Table 1 that had at least 100 counts in total, compared\nto 1354 counts in source #40. We have searched for pulsations in the soft, hard and total\nlight curves of this source, but no dominant pulsation was detected. Close inspection of\nthe soft lightcurve suggest that this source can be a periodic variable, which is not clearly\nvisible due to the presence of flares. We have fitted this lightcurve with a periodic variable\ncomponent (\u223c6.2 hrs period) plus flares, which could be from the accretion disk (Fig. 15).\n\nFig. 15.- The Chandra soft\u2013X-ray (0.2\u20132.0) keV light curve of source #40 with 1000 s\nbinning. This light curve suggests weak variability (\u03c72 /dof \u223c75/58). This variability is\nabsent in the 2\u201310 keV light curve. If this energy-dependent variability in the soft band is\nperiodic, it suggest that the system is either a wind-fed binary or the optical companion has\nan atmosphere, which absorbs the soft X-rays during the observation.\n\n\f\u2013 38 \u2013\nBoth absorbed powerlaw and disk blackbody models fit equally well with the Chandra\nspectrum of source #40. Powerlaw spectral parameters are listed in Table 1. Disk black2\nbody model parameters are: Tin =1.82+0.36\n\u22120.20 keV, Normalization =0.00304\u00b10.0015 and \u03c7 /dof\n= 109/110. This model fits slightly better than the powerlaw model (\u2206\u03c72 =3.9). Parameters of the disk blackbody model suggest that the mass of the accretor of source #40 is\n30\u00b19.0 M\u2299 assuming that the inclination angle ranges between 0 and 45o . HST /ACS/W F C\nH\u03b1 (F658N) image of this ULX candidate field is shown in Figure 16. The astrometriccorrected Chandra position of this ULX is near to a starforming region (Lee et al. 2001),\nindicating that this source is not hosted in any star cluster.\n\nFig. 16.- HST /ACS/W F C H\u03b1 (F658N) image around the astrometric-corrected Chandra\nposition of source #40. A circle of radius 0.\"2 marks the position of the X-ray source.\nSource #40 in NGC 5775 is the most luminous ULX in our catalog (Swartz et al. 2004).\nIt displayed remarkable variability by more than a factor of 500 between Chandra and XMMNewton observations. In addition, its energy dependent light curve displays variations with\na possible period of 6.2 hr and the X-ray spectrum suggest that the mass of the accretor is in\nthe range of 20\u201340 M\u2299 . Based on these results and using the formalism described in Ghosh\net al. (2006), we suggest that this system may be similar to that of Cygnus X3 (Paerels\net al. 2000). The X-ray modulation in Cygnus X-3 is explained as variable scattering in\nthe dense photoionized wind from a Wolf-Rayet companion (Paerels et al. 2000). Energy\n\n\f\u2013 39 \u2013\ndependent light curve of of source #40 (Fig. 15) also indicates that the possible modulation\nmay be either due to high absorbing column or due to occultation of the X-ray source by\nthe mass transfer stream (White & Swank 1982). If the former is true, then this ULX is\nmost likely a wind-fed system. Otherwise, the mass transfer stream will collide with the\naccretion disk and that will generate strong turbulence. This will cause the disk to swell in\nthe vicinity of the confluence and this bulge or thickened region of the accretion disk may\ncause modulation. In this scenario, the dips will have variable depths. Long-term changes\nand instabilities in the outer structure of the disk will result in phase jitter and anomalous\ndips (White & Holt 1982). Presence of flare-like features in the light curve of source #40\nmay be due to instabilities on the disk. These can be tested from future observations over a\nlonger period.\nIntrinsic X-ray luminosity of source #40 is \u223c1041 ergs s\u22121 in the 0.2\u201310 keV energy band,\nwhich suggest that the mass of the accretor has to be at least 770 M\u2299 even if it is accreting\nat the Eddington rate. However, from the HST /ACS data we found that this ULX is not\nhosted in a star cluster, which can host the IMBH. In addition, we have determined that the\nmass of the accretor of this ULX system will be in the range of 20-40 M\u2299 and its the huge\nX-ray flux variability between the Chandra and XMM-Newton observations could be due to\neither geometrical or relativistic beaming along our line of sight. High mass accretion rates\nlead to thick accretion disks causing geometrically beamed emission (Fabrika & Mescheryakov\n2001; King 2001; Fabrika 2004; Poutanen et al. 2007). Geometrical models suggest that the\nX-rays will be beamed through the geometrical funneling and will be absorbed by the Hand He-like ions of abundant heavy elements present in the photosphere of the funnel's inner\nwall. These blue-shifted absorption lines will be superimposed on the emergent multicolorcontinuum spectrum from the funnel (Fabrika & Mescheryakov 2001; Fabrika 2004; Poutanen\net al. 2007). However, we could not detect any such line in the Chandra spectrum of this\nULX, though the 0.5-8 keV continuum fits well with the multicolor disk black body model.\nThus, it is very likely that this ULX is beaming relativistically. Relativistic beaming could be\neither due to inverse-Compton or synchrotron mechanism. In the inverse-Compton scenario,\nif the optical photons from the companion star are up-scattered by the jet, then the X-ray\nemission can power the ULX. X-rays produced by this process will have a broken-powerlaw\nshape with a break-energy at around 1 keV (Georganopoulos, Aharonian & Kirk 2002).\nHowever, we do not find the signature of broken-powerlaw in the Chandra spectrum of this\nULX. Relativistically beamed synchrotron jet will produce spectral curvature (\u0393/dE is >0),\nwhich was suggested based on the EXOSAT spectra of X-ray selected BL Lac objects (Ghosh\n& Soundararajaperumal 1995). Recently, this has been confirmed with high signal-to-noise\nratio XMM-Newton spectra of these objects. (Perlman et al. 2005). Thus, to search for the\nspectral curvature we divided the Chandra spectrum of source #40 in the 0.5-2.0, 2.0-4.0\n\n\f\u2013 40 \u2013\nand 4.0-8.0 keV bands and fitted these spectra with the absorbed single-powerlaw model.\nFig. 17 shows the plot of \u0393 versus energy. A constant model was fitted to this plot that\nresulted with \u0393=1.6 and \u03c72r =1.64 for 2 dof. However, a powerlaw model with a spectral\nslope of 0.75 fits this plot with \u03c72r =0.038 for 1 dof. Using these results we find that the\nF-test statistic and probability values are 85.1 and 0.0687, respectively. This means that\nthe powerlaw model is significant at 93.1% level with respect to the constant model. These\nresults are not robust, which will firmly establish that d\u0393/dE is >0. Thus, we consider these\nresults as a possible signature for the spectral curvature. Spectral curvature can also be\nmeasured using a logarithimicparabola model (Perlman et al. 2005 and references therein):\ndN/dE = ke\u2212\u03c3(E)NH,Gal e\u2212\u03c3(E)NH,int (1+z) E (\u2212\u0393+\u03b2Log(E))\n\n(2)\n\nwhere NH,Gal , NH,int are the Galactic and intrinsic absorbing columns and \u03b2 is the curvature\nparameter. We fitted the Chandra spectrum of source #40 using this model and determined\nthe value of \u03b2 as 0.4\u00b10.2. Again, this is not a highly significant result, but indicates that\nthis spectrum may be curved. If the observed flux variations of source #40 are due to the\npresence and absence of jet emission, then we can assume that beaming has boosted X-ray\nemissions at least by a factor of 500. This can be equated with \u03b4 3+2\u03b1x , where \u03b4 is the Doppler\nboosting factor for the approaching jet with X-ray spectral index \u03b1x . This gives the value of\n\u03b4 as 3.5, which is smaller than the value of \u03b4 determined for the brightest ULX of NGC 5408\n(Kaaret et al. 2003). Thus, we suggest that, most likely, the luminous X-rays from the source\n#40 is due to relativistically beamed synchrotron jet (Kording, Falcke & Markoff 2002).\n\n\f\u2013 41 \u2013\n\nFig. 17.- Plot of photon indices versus photon energy of source #40. The solid line\nrepresents the powerlaw fit with spectral slope of 0.75 and \u03c72r =0.038 for 1 dof. The powerlaw\nmodel is significant at 93.1% level with respect to the constant model. This indicates that\nthe Chandra spectrum of this ULX may be curved, i.e. steeper spectra at higher energies\nwith curvature that remains constant.\n\n3.4.7. Source #41\nThis ULX candidate was detected in both Chandra and XMM-Newton observations.\nThe X-ray spectra fits well with the powerlaw model. Photon index and the hydrogen\nabsorbing column density were almost steady, within the error limits, between the two observations although the 0.5 \u2013 8.0 keV flux varied by almost a factor of two. It is interesting\n+0.17\nto note that both the Chandra (\u0393 = 1.48+0.32\n\u22120.24 ) and XMM-Newton (\u0393 = 1.40\u22120.14 ) spectral\n\n\f\u2013 42 \u2013\nindices of s41 suggest that it is a flat X-ray spectrum source. If flat spectral indices are\nthe signatures of the sub-Eddington accretion rate (\u223c0.02\u00d7LEdd ) at the low-hard state of\nthis ULX, then its observed XMM-Newton luminosity will correspond to \u223c6.3\u00d71041 ergs s\u22121\nas the intrinsic luminosity in the 0.2\u201310 keV energy band (McClintock & Remillard 2006;\nRemillard & McClintock 2006). This suggests that the mass of the accretor has to be at\nleast 4846 M\u2299 even if it is accreting at the Eddington rate and emitting X-rays isotropically.\nHST /ACS/W F C H\u03b1 (F658N) image of this ULX candidate field is shown in Figure 18.\nIt can be seen from this figure that the source #41 is located within a bright H\u03b1 (F658N)\ncomplex. With the available data, we cannot determine whether this source is associated\nwith a Hii region or a star cluster.\n\nFig. 18.- HST /ACS/W F C H\u03b1 (F658N) image around the astrometric-corrected Chandra\nposition of source #41. A circle of radius 0.\"2 marks the position of the X-ray source.\n\n3.4.8. Sources #46 & 47\nThese two ULXs lie within 4\u2032\u2032 of each other and cannot be resolved by XMM-Newton.\nThe sum of the luminosities of the two sources in the Chandra observation is within errors\nequal to the luminosity of the combined object in the XMM-Newton observation. Thus, it\nis likely that both the sources did not vary between the Chandra and XMM-Newton obser-\n\n\f\u2013 43 \u2013\nvations. Source #46 is a relatively absorbed steep X-ray spectrum ULX. HST /ACS/W F C\nH\u03b1 (F658N) image shows that source #46 is embedded in diffuse emission (Figure 19). Radio emissions were detected in the VLA-FIRST and in our ATCA observations from the\nregion but the angular resolution is not sufficient to determine which source is the likely\nradio emitter. However, astrometric results between the VLA-FIRST and the Chandra images of NGC 5775 suggest that the VLA-FIRST position is more consistent with s47. We\nhave already discussed in section 2.4 that s47 did not vary between the VLA-FIRST and\nthe ATCA observations but is a strong radio emitter. No optical counterparts were detected\nwithin the Chandra error circles in the HST /ACS/W F C H\u03b1 (F658N) image around s47\nbut this source is located \u223c2\u2032\u2032 .0 away from a bright-blue object (Figure 20). Photometric\ncolors and absolute magnitudes, assuming that this object is in NGC 5775, suggest that it is\na large star-forming region. Both the Chandra and the XMM-Newton results clearly show\nthat s47 is a flat X-ray spectrum ULX. Thus, the radio, optical and X-ray properties of this\nULX is interesting. For example, the lack of any optical point source at the astrometriccorrected Chandra position of s47 suggests that it is not a background object because its\nvalue of FX /FO will be much larger than the upper limits of B L Lac object (REF). On the\nother hand, its X-ray results clearly show that this ULX was in the low-hard state and the\nobserved high X-ray luminosity indicates for an accretor of mass more than , if accreting at\nthe Eddington rate and emitting isotropically (McClintock & Remillard 2006; Remillard &\nMcClintock 2006). This has been discussed in section . Again, the scenario of a high-mass\naccretor is further supported by the radio/X-ray results, even though these observations\nwere not simultaneous. A \"fundamental plane\" relating black hole mass (M), X-ray (LX )\nand radio luminosities (LR ) in unbeamed sources has been discovered (Corbel et al. 2000,\n2003; Gallo et al. 2003; Falcke et al. 2004; Merloni, Heinz & Di Matteo 2003, 2005). Using\nthis relation:\n+0.11\n+4.05\nlog LR = (0.60+0.11\n\u22120.11 ) log LX + (0.78\u22120.09 ) log M + 7.33\u22124.07 .\n\n(3)\n\nand the observed radio/X-ray fluxes, we find that the mass of the accretor will be very high.\nHowever, large vertical spread (\u03c3R = 0.88) of this relation suggest that the errors will also\nbe large. This puts a limit on the mass the accretor between several hundreds to several\nthousands of solar-mass. Thus, based on the non-simultaneous radio/X-ray results we can\nnot firmly claim that s47 is an IMBH system but it is a very promising candidate.\n\n\f\u2013 44 \u2013\n\nFig. 19.- HST /ACS/W F C H\u03b1 (F658N) image around the astrometric-corrected Chandra\nposition of source #46. A circle of radius 0.\"2 marks the position of the X-ray source.\n\nFig. 20.- HST /ACS/W F C H\u03b1 (F658N) image around the astrometric-corrected Chandra\nposition of source #47. A circle of radius 0.\"2 marks the position of the X-ray source.\n\n\f\u2013 45 \u2013\n3.4.9. Source #49\nThis source was detected only in the XMM-Newton data. Its flux remained steady\nduring this observation. The X-ray spectrum of this ULX candidate fits well with the\npowerlaw model. No source was detected within the error circle at the astrometric corrected\nChandra position of this source in the HST /ACS/W F C F625W image. However, it appears\nfrom the F658N image (Fig. 21) that this ULX is located either within a spherical nebula or\nwithin a dissolved star cluster (Pellerin et al. 2007). The UVW2 image obtained from the\nXMM-Newton optical monitor's telescope shows that the ULX is embedded in the diffuse\nUV emission, which is the typical characteristic of dissolved star clusters (Pellerin et al.\n2007). We have discussed in section 2.4 that s49 is most likely a radio variable ULX, which\nwas detected during our ATCA observations (1.12\u00b10.1 mJy beam\u22121 at 4.8 GHz). Using\nthe \"fundamental plane\" relation, equation (3), and the observed radio and X-ray fluxes\nwe estimate that the mass of the accretor as 8.3\u00d7104 M\u2299 . Due to the large vertical spread\n(\u03c3R = 0.88) of this relation we find that the mass of the accretor could as low as a few hundred\nsolar-mass. In addition, the radio and the X-ray observations were not simultaneous. Thus,\nwe should consider these results cautiously. However, it should be mentioned that s49 is\na potential IMBH candidate and future simultaneous radio/X-ray observations are highly\nessential.\n\n\f\u2013 46 \u2013\nFig. 21.- HST /ACS/W F C H\u03b1 (F658N) image around the astrometric-corrected Chandra\nposition of source #49. A circle of radius 0.\"2 marks the position of the X-ray source.\nTen ULXs are detected within the D25 isophotes of NGC 5774 and NGC 5775. Sources #1,\n12, 28 and 40 are all located within bright starforming complexes and no optical counterparts have been detected within the astrometric corrected Chandra positions of these sources.\nBased on their observed properties we suggest that these are stellar-mass black hole systems.\nX-ray spectra of sources #4 and 46 are steep and they are embedded in diffuse emission,\nwhich may be ionized nebulae. Ionized nebulae with bubble-like morphology are detected\naround some ULXs (Roberts et al. 2003; Pakull & Mirioni 2003; Pakull, Grise & Motch\n2006). These bubbles are several hundred parsec in diameter with expansion velocities\naround 50\u201380 km s\u22121 (Rosado et al. 1981, Rosado et al. 1982, Valdez-Guti\u00e9rrez et al.\n2001). It has been suggested that the expansion could be due to the combined action of\nenergetic supernova explosions and stellar winds, or to continuous inflation by jets (Miller\n1995, Valdez-Guti\u00e9rrez et al. 2001, Wang 2002, Pakull & Mirioni 2003, Pakull, Grise &\nMotch 2006). Some nebulae show barrel-type shapes or enhanced emission along opposite\ndirections that could be interpreted as excitation from a beamed source (Roberts et al.\n2003; Pakull & Mirioni 2003). However, some nebulae have displayed spur-shape, which\nrequires an isotropic flux of energetic photons to explain the observed HeII flux (Kaaret et\nal. 2004; Pakull, Grise & Motch 2006). Nebulae formed by the combined action of supernova\nremnants and stellar winds are not supposed to have HeII emission unless it contains very\nmassive stars. Thus, detection of an non-spherical HeII nebula at the position of the ULX\nwill support the beaming model of these two ULXs. Nebulae formed around IMBHs will be\nmuch smaller in size compared to the nebulae formed by SNe or jets. Thus, the observed\nsizes of diffuse emission around s04 and s46 suggest that they are not IMBH systems.\nAnother mechanism that is prevalent in interacting galaxies and may lead to the formation of luminous X-ray sources is the formation of super star clusters (SSCs). There is\na general correlation between the formation of SSCs and galaxy mergers (Whitmore 2000).\nKeel & Borne (2003) have shown that this trend applies also to systems like NGC 5774/5775\nand does not require direct contact to occur. Theory suggests that the most massive black\nholes may come from mergers of massive main sequence (Portegies Zwart et al. 2004) or protostars (Soria 2006) within these young massive SSCs. If these intermediate-mass black holes\nwith masses \u226b20 M\u2299 can form in SSCs and can capture a stellar companion (Baumgardt\net al. 2005) then X-ray luminosities near the Eddington limit, 1.3\u00d71038 ergs s\u22121 , are likely\nto produce ultraluminous X-ray sources. The ULX X-1 in M82 is believed to be of this type\n(Strohmayer & Mushotzky 2003; Agrawal & Misra 2006; Dewangan, Titarchuk, & Griffiths\n2006; Mucciarelli et al. 2006). Luminous sources #24, 41, 47 and 49 are all associated with\n\n\f\u2013 47 \u2013\neither young star clusters or bright starforming complexes. These ULXs are potential IMBH\nsystems, which have been discussed in sections 3.4.4, 3.4.7, 3.4.8 and 3.4.9, respectively.\nFrom the comparison of X-ray luminosities of ULXs detected in NGC 5775 during the\nChandra and XMM-Newton observations, we find that s41 and s47 varied at the most by\nless than a factor of two. On the other hand, s24, s28, s40 and s49 displayed dramatic\nvariations. Both these two types of ULXs may form in starforming environments that have\nsub-solar metalicities. We have already seen that the diffuse gas in the starburst galaxy\nNGC 5775 is composed of sub-solar materials. As a result of this the newly-formed massive\nstars in the disk of NGC 5775 may leave more massive compact remnants than is typical\nfor solar-metallicity stars. The combination of more massive black holes and more massive\ncompanions can lead to more luminous and longer-lived X-ray emission once mass transfer\nbegins via a stellar wind or through Roche lobe-filling. Wind-fed binaries will steadily emit\nX-rays over long time. However, Roche lobe-fill systems will display dramatic variations\nboth in fluxes and spectra.\n\n3.5.\n\nRelationship between ULXs and FIR, IR UV luminosities of interacting\ngalaxies\n\nFrom our Chandra survey of ULXs, we found a correlation between the observed number of ULXs per galaxy (NU LX ) and the far infrared luminosity (LF IR ). In addition we\nhave also found that the observed number of ULXs per galaxy and the nearest neighbor\ndistance are anti-correlated (Swartz et al. 2004). This means that the observed number\nof ULXs in interacting/merging galaxies strongly depends on LF IR . However, Brassington\net al. (2005) found a weak correlation between NU LX and LF IR of five interacting/merging\ngalaxies. Instead, they found that LU LX , determined following the prescriptions of Colbert et al. (2004), is relatively better correlated with LF IR of the same five galaxies. It\nmay be mentioned that such a correlation is obviously expected because the value of LU LX\nstrongly depends on LF IR (Colbert et al. 2004). Thus, we decided to study the relation between NU LX and LU LX using The Cartwheel (AM 0035-335), M82 (NGC 3034), NGC 3256,\nArp 270 (NGC 3395/3396), Arp 299 (NGC 3690/IC 694), Antennae NGC 4038/4039),\nNGC 4485/4490, The Mice (Arp 242, NGC 4676A/B), NGC 5194/5195, NGC 5774/5775,\nArp 220 (IRAS 15327+2340), and NGC 7252, which are interacting/merging galaxies with\nelevated number of ULXs. To maintain uniformity, we have analyzed all the archival data\nfrom Chandra and XMM-Newton observations and detected X-ray sources within the D25\nisophotes of these galaxies. When the intrinsic luminosities of the X-ray sources are more\nthan 1039 ergs s\u22121 in the 0.5-8.0 keV band, then those objects have been identified as ULX\n\n\f\u2013 48 \u2013\ncandidates. Next, we computed the number of possible background AGNs within the D25\nisophotes using the log(N)\u2013log(S) relation deduced from the Chandra Deep Field South\nsurvey (Rosati et al. 2002). Finally, we determined total ULXs per galaxy, which will be\nconsidered as NU LX , after subtracting the background AGNs. LU LX was computed using\nequation 4 of Colbert et al. (2004). The values of LK were derived using the the K-band\napparent magnitude from 2MASS and following the expression given in Seigar (2005). We\nhave used GALEX data or the XMM-Newton/OM data in the UV1 and UV2 bands to determine the values of LU V and that for FIR were derived using the 60 and 100 \u03bcm IRAS\nflux densities (Devereux & Eales 1989). Fig 22 displays the plot of NU LX versus Log (LU LX )\nand fitting gives a slope of 1.03 with a correlation coefficient of 0.34. However, if we exclude\nThe Cartwheel and Arp 220 from fitting, then the slope changes to 1.38 with a correlation\ncoefficient of 0.83. This fit is shown with the straight line in Fig. 22 and indicates that the\nnumber of ULXs per galaxy depends on LU LX , which is a function of FIR, near-IR and UV\nluminosities. This is an interesting result and suggests that the value of NU LX depends not\nonly on the SFR but also on the mass of the host galaxies (Colbert et al. 2004). It can\nalso be seen from this figure that the large number of ULXs detected in The Cartwheel may\nnot be the true ULX population of this galaxy system. At least four to five sources are in\nexcess compared to the expected value. Detection of these four-five sources may be the result\nof source confusion. On the other hand a large number of ULXs are missing in Arp 220.\nThese missing ULXs may be highly variable, which were below the detection level during\nthe Chandra observations of this galaxy. It is also evident from Fig. 22 that at least two to\nthree ULXs are missing in NGC 5775. This indicates that the two ULX candidates (s18 and\ns23) marked as possible halo-objects of NGC 5775, may really belong to this galaxy. Finally,\nwe conclude that the interacting/merging galaxies host comparable number of ULXs based\non their mass and starformation rate.\n\n\f\u2013 49 \u2013\n\nFig. 22.- Plot of NU LX versus Log (LU LX ). Solid line shows the fit with slope 1.38 and\ncorrelation coefficient of 0.83. This fit is without The Cartwheel and Arp 220.\n\n4.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe number of nearby interacting galaxies that exhibit elevated number of ULXs is\nquite small, so the interacting galaxy pair NGC 5774/5775 is an important system in that\nregard. These two galaxies are connected through two bridges, which is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe size of the image in Fig. 1 is 6.'6\u00d75.'8 that contains two galaxies, two bridges and\nadjacent fields in between. We have performed a multiwavelength study of the whole system\nand the main results are summarized as follows:\n1. In total forty nine X-ray sources were detected in the 6.'6\u00d75.'5 field. In this field we\n\n\f\u2013 50 \u2013\nexpect 3 background sources at or above the detection flux level of a ULX in NGC 5774/5775,\nbased on the log(N)\u2013log(S) relation deduced from the Chandra Deep Field South survey\n(Rosati et al. 2002). However, two and three background AGNs were identified in this field\nfrom our optical spectroscopic and photometric studies, respectively.\n2. We have detected two sources on the two bridges and these two sources are expected to\nbe HMXRBs. It is likely that interaction-induced starformation was triggered on the bridges\nand these HMXRBs were formed. Other relatively faint X-ray population on the bridges\ncan be detected with deeper X-ray observations. Outside the D25 isophote of NGC 5775 but\nwithin the 6.'6\u00d75.'5 field we have detected two ULX candidates, s18 and s23, which appear\nto be located on the bridges. However, their closeness to the D25 isophote of NGC 5775\nindicate that they may be in the halo of this edge-on galaxy or at the interface of the bridge\nand the halo of NGC 5775. In addition, we have detected another bright (\u223c1041 ergs s\u22121 )\nULX, s25, which is associated with a background galaxy SDSS J145355.82+033431.8 at a\nredshift of 0.0953\u00b10.0002.\n3. Eight sources, excluding one AGN, was detected in an extremely low starforming\ngalaxy, NGC 5774. X-ray population of this galaxy can not be explained using the universal\nXLF of HMXRBs proposed by Grimm, Gilfanov, & Sunyaev (2003a). However, it has been\ndemonstrated that the X-ray source population of NGC 5774 consists of the older and the\nyounger stellar populations, which are directly related to the mass and SFR of NGC 5774\n(Colbert et al. 2004; Grimm, Gilfanov, & Sunyaev 2003b). On the other hand twenty four Xray sources, excluding one AGN, of the starburst galaxy NGC 5775 can be well described with\nthe universal XLF formalism of Grimm, Gilfanov, & Sunyaev (2003a). In fact, the XLF of\nNGC 5775 is consistent with that of other interacting galaxies. These results indicate that\nthe interacting/merging galaxies have comparable numbers of luminous sources (Grimm,\nGilfanov, & Sunyaev 2003a,b; Colbert et al. 2004).\n4. Presence of AGNs were not detected from the optical spectra of the nuclei of\nNGC 5774 and NGC 5775. In addition, no nuclear point sources were detected in the\nChandra images of these two galaxies suggesting that they do not host active nuclei. Diffuse\nemission was not detected in NGC 5774 but single temperature sub-solar gas is present in\nNGC 5775. The temperature of this gas (\u223c0.3 keV) is lower than that to the detected in\nother interacting galaxies (\u223c0.5 keV). Un-resolved X-ray sources contribute significantly to\nthe diffuse emission of NGC 5775. Outflows/winds are detected in the HST/ACS H\u03b1 image\nof NGC 5775, which suggest that the gas in the central region of this starburst galaxy is being compressed to produce galactic winds. All these observed properties clearly demonstrate\nthat NGC 5775 is in the beginning of the evolutionary process (Taniguchi et al. 2000).\n5.\n\nExcluding the background AGNs and the two ULX candidates in the halo of\n\n\f\u2013 51 \u2013\nNGC 5775, we have detected 10 ULX candidates within the D25 isophotes of NGC 5774\nand NGC 5775. Interestingly, these 10 ULX candidates fall in three groups - (i) s01, s12, s28\nand s40 do not have any optical counterparts and are powerlaw X-ray luminous sources with\nphoton indices around 1.8, (ii) s04 and s46 are having steep-powerlaw X-ray spectra and\nembedded in diffuse H\u03b1 emission, which are probably ionized nebulae, and (iii) s24, s41, s47\nand s49 are hosted in either young star clusters or bright starforming complexes and all are\nflat-powerlaw X-ray sources. Variable radio emissions from s47 and s49 are detected. ULXs\ncandidates in the first group are believed to be stellar-mass black hole systems. Among\nthese four objects, s40 is the brightest (\u223c1041 ergs s\u22121 ) with a possible 6.2 hr period and it\nvaried at least by more than a factor of 500. Most likely it is a relativistically beamed ULX\nand may be similar to Cygnus X-3 (Ghosh et al. 2006). Formation of H\u03b1 nebulae around\ns04 and s46 could be due to energetic supernova explosions or to continuous inflation by\njets. Variability, high S/N spectra and optical morphology of the whole system will help to\ndetermine the nature of these two ULX candidates. Finally, the four ULX candidates of the\nlast group are potential IMBH candidates. Simultaneous radio and X-ray observations of\nthese objects will be extremely useful to determine the mass of the accretors of these ULXs.\n6. Number of ULXs in interacting/merging galaxies are correlated with the FIR, Kband and UV luminosities of their host galaxies, suggesting that the formation and evolution\nof ULXs depend not only on the starformation rate but also on the mass of these galaxies.\nOur sincere thanks to the referee's helpful comments and suggestions which improved\nthis paper.
