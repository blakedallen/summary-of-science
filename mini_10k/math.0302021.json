In this paper we deal\nL\nwith graded vertex algebras V = i\u2208Z Vi , so that Vi (n)Vj \u2286 Vi+j\u2212n\u22121 and 1 \u2208 V0 . A vertex\nalgebra is called OZ (abbreviation of \"One-Zero\") [12] if it is graded so that dim V0 = 1 and\nVi = 0 for i = 1 or i < 0. If V is an OZ vertex algebra, then [9] V2 is a commutative (but not\nnecessary associative) algebra with respect to the product (1) : V2 \u2297 V2 \u2192 V2 , with an invariant\nsymmetric bilinear form (i.e. such that hab | ci = ha | bci), given by the product (3) : V2 \u2297V2 \u2192 V0 .\nIt is called the Griess algebra of V .1\n\n1.1\n\nFormulation of the results\n\nIn this paper we prove the following result.\nTheorem 1.1.\na. For any commutative algebra A with a symmetric invariant non-degenerate bilinear form\nthere is a simple OZ vertex algebra V such that A \u2286 V2 .\nb. If A has a unit e, then V can be chosen so that \u03c9 = 2e is a Virasoro element of V (see\nSection 2.1 for the definition).\nc. If G \u2282 Aut A is a finite group of automorphisms of A, then V can be chosen so that\nG \u2282 Aut V .\nWe prove this theorem under the assumption, that the ground field k is a subfield of C, since\nour proof uses some analytic methods (see Section 3). However, we believe that the statement\ncan be generalized to an arbitrary field of characteristic 0. Also, the assumption that the form\nis non-degenerate does not seem to be very essential.\n\u22c6\n\nThis paper is a contribution to the Special Issue on Kac\u2013Moody Algebras and Applications. The full collection\nis available at http://www.emis.de/journals/SIGMA/Kac-Moody algebras.html\n1\nWe note that the term \"Griess algebra\" might not be the most successful one, as the original Griess algebra [11]\nis not quite a Griess algebra in our sense.\n\n\f2\n\nM. Roitman\nIn fact we suggest that the following conjecture might be true:\n\nConjecture 1.1.\na. For any commutative algebra A with a symmetric invariant bilinear form there is an OZ\nvertex algebra V such that A = V2 .\nb. If dim A < \u221e, then V can be chosen so that dim Vn < \u221e for n = 3, 4, 5, . . ..\nIt follows from Theorem 1.1 that there are no Griess identities other than commutativity, in\nother words, for any non-trivial identity in the variety of commutative algebras with symmetric\ninvariant bilinear forms there is a Griess algebra in which this identity does not hold.\nHere we outline our construction of V . First we construct a vertex algebra B = B0 \u2295 B2 \u2295\nB3 \u2295 * * * , such that B0 is a polynomial algebra and A \u2282 B2 . In fact we construct the vertex\ncoalgebra of correlation functions on B, defined in Section 4, and then derive B from it. After\nthat we find a suitable invariant bilinear form h* | *i on B and set V = B/ Kerh* | *i.\nWe remark that our methods would perfectly work for a more general problem: Given an\n\"initial segment\" A0 \u2295 A1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Am of a vertex algebra, closed\nunder those of the vertex\nL\noperations (n) that make sense, find a vertex algebra V =\nV\nd>0 d such that Vd \u2283 Ad for\n0 6 d 6 m.\n\n1.2\n\nPreviously known results\n\nProbably the most famous example of OZ vertex algebras is the Moonshine module V \u266e , constructed by Frenkel, Lepowsky and Meurman in [8, 9], see also [1, 2]. Its Griess algebra V2\u266e\nhas dimension 196 884, and differs from the original 196 883-dimensional commutative algebra\nconstructed by Griess [11] by having an additional identity element. The automorphism group\nof V \u266e and of V2\u266e is the Fischer\u2013Griess Monster [9, 11, 25]. It is proved by Dong et al. [3, 6], that\nthe representations of V \u266e are completely reducible, and the only irreducible representation is V \u266e\nitself. The present research was primarily motivated by this construction.\nAnother example of OZ vertex algebra is a Virasoro vertex algebra Vir [10, 26]. It is generated\nby a single Virasoro element \u03c9 \u2208 Vir2 so that the Griess algebra of Vir is k \u03c9. The representation\ntheory of the algebras Vir is investigated in [26].\nIf A is associative, than it is well known that A can appear as a Griess algebra, see [15, 27].\nLam [16] also showed the same for a simple Jordan algebra of type A, B or C. Other interesting\nexamples of OZ vertex algebras and their Griess algebras can be found in [12].\nWe remark that if a vertex algebra V is graded so that Vn = 0 for n < 0 and dim V0 = 1,\nthen V1 is a Lie algebra with respect to the product (0), with invariant bilinear form given by\nproduct (1). The analogous problem of finding a vertex algebra V such that V1 is a given Lie\nalgebra has a well-know solution: to every Lie algebra L with an invariant bilinear form there\nb so that a certain highest weight L-module\nb\ncorresponds an affine Lie algebra L,\nhas the desired\nvertex algebra structure [9, 10].\n\n1.3\n\nOrganization of the manuscript\n\nIn Section 2 we recall some basic definitions and notations of the theory of vertex algebras.\nThen in Section 3 we consider a class of rational functions that we call regular. The correlation\nfunctions of a sufficiently nice vertex algebra will belong to that class. Then in Section 3.4 we\ndefine a more narrow class of admissible functions. The correlation functions of the algebras B\nand V that we construct later are admissible. In Section 4 we introduce a notion of vertex\ncoalgebra of correlation functions, and show how to reconstruct a vertex algebra by its coalgebra\nof correlation functions. In Section 4.6 we show that in some important cases the component of\ndegree 0 of such vertex algebra is isomorphic to a polynomial algebra. In Section 5 we study some\n\n\fOn Griess Algebras\n\n3\n\neasy properties of OZ vertex algebras, in particular (in Section 5.2) investigate the behavior of\nthe correlation functions in the presence of a Virasoro element. Then in Section 6 we construct\ncertain vertex algebra B using the coalgebra techniques developed in Section 4 and show (in\nSection 6.1) how the existence of the algebra B implies Theorem 1.1.\n\n1.4\n\nFurther questions\n\nThough the methods used in this paper are very explicit, it seems that the OZ vertex algebras\nconstructed here are of \"generic type\", i.e. they probably don't have these nice properties people\nare looking for in vertex algebra theory \u2013 for example, an interesting representation theory,\nvarious finiteness conditions, controllable Zhu algebra, etc. It would be extremely interesting to\nrecover the OZ vertex algebras mentioned above using our approach, especially the Moonshine\nmodule V \u266e .\nAlso, it would be very interesting to see whether any properties of the commutative algebra A\n(e.g. if A is a Jordan algebra) imply any properties of the OZ vertex algebra V , constructed in\nTheorem 1.1.\n\n2\n\nGeneral facts about vertex algebras\n\nHere we fix the notations and give some minimal definitions. For more details on vertex algebras\nthe reader can refer to the books [9, 14, 17, 27]. Unless otherwise noted, we assume that all\nalgebras and spaces are over a ground field k \u2282 C.\n\n2.1\n\nDefinition of vertex algebras\n\nDefinition 2.1. A vertex algebra is a linear space V equipped with a family of bilinear products\na \u2297 b 7\u2192 a(n)b, indexed by integer parameter n, and with an element 1 \u2208 V , called the unit,\nsatisfying the identities (V1)\u2013(V4) below. Let D : V \u2192 V be the map defined by Da = a(\u22122)1.\nThen the identities are:\n(V1) a(n)b = 0 for n \u226b 0,\n(V2) 1(n)a = \u03b4n,\u22121 a\n\nand a(n)1 =\n\n1\n(\u2212n\u22121)!\n\nD \u2212n\u22121 a,\n\n(V3) D(a(n)b) = (Da)(n)b + a(n)(Db) and (Da)(n)b = \u2212n a(n \u2212 1)b,\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0001\n\u0001 X m\n\u0001\n(V4) a(m) b(n)c \u2212 b(n) a(m)c =\na(s)b (m + n \u2212 s)c\ns\ns>0\n\nfor all a, b, c \u2208 V and m, n \u2208 Z.\n\nAnother way of defining vertex algebras is by using the generating series\nY : V \u2192 Hom(V, V ((z)))\ndefined for a \u2208 V by\nX\nY (a, z) =\na(n) z \u2212n\u22121 ,\nn\u2208Z\n\nwhere a(n) : V \u2192 V is the operator given by b 7\u2192 a(n)b, and z is a formal variable. The most\nimportant property of these maps is that they are local: for any a, b \u2208 V there is N > 0 such\nthat\n\u0002\n\u0003\nY (a, w), Y (b, z) (w \u2212 z)N = 0.\n(2.1)\n\n\f4\n\nM. Roitman\n\nIn fact, this is the only essential condition that one needs to postulate to define vertex algebras [14, 19]. The minimal number N for which (2.1) holds is called the locality of a and b, and\nis denoted by loc(a, b).\nRemark 2.1. One could extend this definition to allow a negative locality (see [23]), so that\nloc(a, b) = min{ n \u2208 Z | a(m)b = 0 \u2200 m > n }.\nIn terms of the series Y , the identities (V2) and (V3) read respectively\nY (1, z) = id,\n\nY (a, z)1 = exp(Dz)a\n\n(2.2)\n\nand\nY (Da, z) = [D, Y (a, z) ] = \u2202z Y (a, z).\n\n(2.3)\n\nAmong other identities that hold in vertex algebras are the quasi-symmetry\nX\n\u0001\na(n)b = \u2212\n(\u22121)n+i D (i) b(n + i)a ,\n\n(2.4)\n\ni>0\n\nand the associativity identity\n\u0012 \u0013\nX\n\u0001\n\u0001\nm\na(m)b (n)c =\n(\u22121)s\na(m \u2212 s) b(n + s)c\ns\ns>0\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX\n\u0001\nm\ns\n\u2212\n(\u22121)\nb(n + s) a(m \u2212 s)c .\nm\u2212s\n\n(2.5)\n\ns6m\n\nFor m > 0 this simplifies to\n\u0012 \u0013\nm\nX\n\u0001\nm\n(\u22121)s\na(m)b (n)c =\n[a(m \u2212 s), b(n + s) ] c,\ns\ns=0\nwhich can also be derived from the identity (V4) of Definition 2.1 by some simple manipulations.\nL\nA vertex algebra V is called graded (by the integers) if V = i\u2208Z Vi is a graded space, so\nthat Vi (n)Vj \u2286 Vi+j\u2212n\u22121 and 1 \u2208 V0 . It is often assumed that a vertex algebra V is graded\nand V2 contains a special element \u03c9, called the Virasoro element of V , such that \u03c9(0) = D,\n\u03c9(1)|Vi = i and the coefficients \u03c9(n) generate a representation of the Virasoro Lie algebra:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 m\u22121\n[\u03c9(m), \u03c9(n) ] = (m \u2212 n) \u03c9(m + n \u2212 1) + \u03b4m+n,2\nc\n(2.6)\n2\n3\nfor some constant c \u2208 k called the central charge of V . In this case V is called conformal vertex\nalgebra or, when dim Vi < \u221e, a vertex operator algebra. The condition (2.6) is equivalent to the\nfollowing relations\n\u03c9(0)\u03c9 = D\u03c9,\n\n\u03c9(1)\u03c9 = 2\u03c9,\n\n\u03c9(2)\u03c9 = 0,\n\nc\n\u03c9(3)\u03c9 = ,\n2\n\n\u03c9(n)\u03c9 = 0 for n > 4.\n\n(2.7)\n\nThis means that \u03c9 generates a Virasoro conformal algebra, see [14].\nDefinition 2.2 ([12]). AL\nvertex algebra V is called OZ (abbreviation of \"One-Zero\") if it is\ngraded so that V = k1 \u2295 n>2 Vn .\n\n\fOn Griess Algebras\n\n5\n\nAn OZ vertex algebra V has dim V0 = 1 and dim V1 = 0, which explains the name. The\ncomponent V2 is a commutative (but not necessarily associative) algebra with respect to the\nproduct a\u2297b 7\u2192 ab = a(1)b, called the Griess algebra of V . The commutativity follows from (2.4).\nThe algebra V2 has a bilinear form ha | bi = a(3)b. From (2.4) it follows that this form is\nsymmetric, and from (2.5) it follows that it it invariant: hab | ci = ha | bci.\nRemark 2.2. It should be noted that the idea that the 196 883-dimensional Griess's algebra\ncan be realized (after adjoining a unit) as a degree 2 component of a vertex algebra is due to\nFrenkel, Lepowsky and Meurman [9]. The general fact that degree 2 component of any OZ\nvertex algebra has a commutative algebra structure with a symmetric invariant bilinear form is\nmentioned in this book as a triviality.\nOne can define analogous structure on the components V0 and V1 . Namely, if a graded vertex\nalgebra V satisfies Vn = 0 for n 6 0, then V0 is an associative commutative algebra with respect\nto the product (\u22121), and V1 is a Lie algebra with respect to the product (0) with an invariant\nsymmetric bilinear form given by the product (1).\nWe note that all definitions in this subsection make sense for k being a commutative associative algebra containing Q. In this case by \"linear space\" we understand a torsion-free k-module.\nThis remark applies also to Sections 2.4\u20132.6 below, and to the parts of Section 2.3 that does not\nrefer to correlation functions.\n\n2.2\n\nCorrelation functions\n\nDenote by \u03a6l the space of rational functions in the variables z1 , . . . , zl of the form\nY\n\u03b1 = p(z1 , . . . , zl )\n(zi \u2212 zj )kij ,\np \u2208 k[z1 , . . . , zl ],\n\n(2.8)\n\n16i<j6l\n\nwhere kij \u2208 Z.

The space \u03a6l = d\u2208Z \u03a6ld is graded in the\nusual sense, so that deg zi = 1.\nLet V be a graded vertex algebra, and let f : V \u2192 k be a linear functional of degree d \u2208 Z,\ni.e. f (Vn ) = 0 for n 6= d. Take some elements a1 , . . . , al \u2208 V of degrees d1 , . . . , dl respectively\nand formal variables z1 , . . . , zl .

Roitman\n\nP\nSince deg ai (mi ) = di \u2212 mi \u2212 1, we get deg \u03b1f = deg f \u2212 li=1 di .\nIt can be shown (see [7, 17]) that the rationality and commutativity properties of correlation\nfunctions together with the conditions (2.2) and (2.3) can serve as an equivalent definition of\nvertex algebras. We will use this fact in Section 4 below.\nIn order to explain the meaning of the associativity condition, we need to introduce another\ndefinition. Take some 1 6 i < j 6 l. A function \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6l has expansion\nX\n\u03b1(z1 , . . . , zn ) =\n\u03b1k (z1 , . . . , zbi , . . . , zl ) (zi \u2212 zj )k\n(2.10)\nk>k0\n\nfor \u03b1k \u2208 \u03a6l\u22121 . Here and below the hat over a term indicates that this term is omitted. Then\n(k)\nwe define the operators \u03c1ij : \u03a6l \u2192 \u03a6l\u22121 by setting\n(k)\n\n\u03c1ij \u03b1 = \u03b1k .\n\n(2.11)\n\nAn important property of these maps is that for any 1 6 i < j 6 l and 1 6 s < t 6 l, such that\n{s, t} \u2229 {i, j} = \u2205, and m, k \u2208 Z,\n(m) (k)\n\n(k) (m)\n\n\u03c1st \u03c1ij = \u03c1ij \u03c1st .\n\n(2.12)\n\nNow the associativity condition means that if \u03b1f is a correlation function corresponding to\n(k)\nthe elements a1 , . . . , al and a functional f : V \u2192 k, then \u03c112 \u03b1f is the correlation function\ncorresponding to the elements a1 (\u2212k \u2212 1)a2 , a3 , . . . , al and the same functional f .\n\n2.3\n\nThe action of sl2\n\nIn this paper we will deal with vertex algebras equipped a certain action of the Lie algebra sl2 .\nL\nDefinition 2.3. A vertex algebra V is said to have sl2 structure, if V =\nd\u2208Z Vd is graded,\n\u2217\nand there is a locally nilpotent operator D : V \u2192 V of degree \u22121, such that D \u2217 1 = 0 and\n[D \u2217 , a(m) ] = (2d \u2212 m \u2212 2) a(m + 1) + (D \u2217 a)(m)\n\n(2.13)\n\nfor every a \u2208 Vd .\nLet \u03b4 : V \u2192 V be the grading derivation, defined by \u03b4|Vd = d. It is easy to compute that if\nD \u2217 : V \u2192 V satisfies condition (2.13), then\n[D \u2217 , D ] = 2\u03b4,\n\n[\u03b4, D ] = D,\n\n[\u03b4, D \u2217 ] = \u2212D \u2217 ,\n\nso that D \u2217 , D and \u03b4 span a copy of sl2 .\nAll vertex algebras in this paper are assumed to have sl2 structure, all ideals are stable\nunder sl2 and homomorphisms of vertex algebras preserve the action of sl2 .\nAn element a \u2208 V such that D \u2217 a = 0 is called minimal. It is easy to see that if V is generated\nby minimal elements, then any operator D \u2217 : V \u2192 V satisfying (2.13) must be locally nilpotent.\nIf V has a Virasoro element \u03c9, then we can take D \u2217 = \u03c9(2). Note that we always have\nD = \u03c9(0) and \u03b4 = \u03c9(1), therefore conformal vertex algebras always have an sl2 structure.\nVertex algebras with an action of sl2 as above were called quasi-vertex operator algebras in [7]\nand homogeneous minimal elements are sometimes called quasi-primary.\nNow we describe the dual action on the correlation functions. It follows from (2.3) that the\noperator dual to D is \u2206 = \u2202z1 + * * * + \u2202zl , so that\n\u0001\nf DY (a1 , z1 ) * * * Y (al , zl )1 = \u2206\u03b1f (z1 , . . . , zl )\n\n\fOn Griess Algebras\n\n7\n\nfor any homogeneous a1 , . . . , al \u2208 V and f : V \u2192 k. Note that \u2206 : \u03a6l \u2192 \u03a6l is an operator of\ndegree \u22121.\nTo describe the dual operator of D \u2217 , consider the differential operator \u2206\u2217 (n, z) = z 2 \u2202z + n z.\nFor the formal variables z1 , . . . , zl , and for a sequence of integers n1 , . . . , nl set\n\u2206\u2217 (n1 , . . . , nl ) = \u2206\u2217 (n1 , z1 ) + * * * + \u2206\u2217 (nl , zl ).\nBy (2.13), we have\n\u0001\nf D \u2217 Y (a1 , z1 ) * * * Y (al , zl )1 = \u2206\u2217 (2d1 , . . . , 2dl ) \u03b1f (z1 , . . . , zl )\n\nfor minimal homogeneous elements a1 , . . . , al \u2208 V of degrees deg ai = di and a functional f :\nV \u2192 k.\nUsing the relations\n\u2206\u2217 (n1 , . . . , nl ) (zi \u2212 zj ) = (zi \u2212 zj ) \u2206\u2217 (n1 , . . . , ni + 1, . . . , nj + 1, . . . , nl ),\n\u2206\u2217 (n1 , . . . , nl ) zi = zi \u2206\u2217 (n1 , . . . , ni + 1, . . . , nl ),\n\n(2.14)\n\nwhere zi and zi \u2212 zj are viewed as operators on \u03a6l , we see that \u2206\u2217 (n1 , . . . , nl ) is an operator\non \u03a6l of degree 1.\nWe are going to need some easy facts about sl2 -module structure of V :\nLemma 2.1.\na. If d < 0, then Vd = (D \u2217 )1\u2212d V1 .\nb. DV\u22121 \u2286 D \u2217 V1 .\nThese statements hold for any graded sl2 -module V on which D \u2217 is locally nilpotent and\n\u03b4 V = d [24]. The second statement follows easily from the first:\nd\n\nDV\u22121 = DD \u2217 V0 = D \u2217 DV0 \u2286 D \u2217 V1 .\nFor vertex algebras the action of sl2 was also investigated in [5].\n\n2.4\n\nThe universal enveloping algebra\n\nFor any vertex algebra V we can construct a Lie algebra L = Coeff V in the following way\n[1, 14, 20, 22]. Consider the linear space k[t, t\u22121 ] \u2297 V , where t is a formal variable. Denote\na(n) = a \u2297 tn for n \u2208 Z. As a linear space, L is the quotient of k[t, t\u22121 ] \u2297 V by the subspace\nspanned by the relations (Da)(n) = \u2212n a(n \u2212 1). The brackets are given by\n[a(m), b(n) ] =\n\nX \u0012m \u0013\ni>0\n\ni\n\n\u0001\na(i)b (m + n \u2212 i),\n\n(2.15)\n\nwhich is precisely the identity (V4) of Definition 2.1. The spaces L\u00b1 = Span{ a(n) | n >\n<0} \u2282 L\nare Lie subalgebras of L so that L = L\u2212 \u2295 L+ .\nRemark 2.3. The construction of L makes use of only the products (n) for n > 0 and the\nmap D. This means that it works for a more general algebraic structure, known as conformal\nalgebra [14, 21].\n\n\f8\n\nM. Roitman\n\nNow assume that the vertex algebra V has an sl2 structure. Then (V3) of Definition 2.1\nand (2.13) define derivations D : L \u2192 L and D \u2217 : L \u2192 L so we get an action of sl2 on L by\nb = L \u22ca sl2 the corresponding semi-direct product.\nderivations.

In fact, it follows from the commutativity property of correlation functions (see\nSection 2.2) that if S and S \u2032 differ by a permutation, then WS = WS \u2032 .\nIt is proved in [24] that any module over a vertex algebra V is a continuous module over U (V ),\nin the sense that for any sequence u1 , u2 , . . . \u2208 U (V ) that converges to 0 and for any v \u2208 M we\nhave ui v = 0 for i \u226b 0.

Here \u03b1\u2032n,j and \u03b1\u2032\u2032n,j are rational functions depending on the variables { zi | i \u2208 I }, and\n\u03b1\u2032\u2032n,j and { zi | i \u2208 J } respectively, and we have\ndeg \u03b1\u2032n,j = n \u2212\n\nX\ni\u2208I\n\ndi\n\nand\n\ndeg \u03b1\u2032\u2032n,j = n \u2212\n\nX\n\ndi .\n\ni\u2208J\n\nWe call the term (\u03b1)n in (3.1) the component of \u03b1 of degree n corresponding to partition I \u2294 J.\nNote that \u03b1\u2032\u2032n,j \u2208 \u03a6|J| , while in general \u03b1\u2032n,j 6\u2208 \u03a6|I| , since \u03b1\u2032n,j may have a pole at zi .\nAssume that \u03b1 = \u03b1f satisfies (\u03b1)n = 0 for \u0001n < m, and assume that I = {i1 , . . . , ir },\nJ = {ir+1 , . . . , il }. Then f ai1 (m1 ) * * * ail (ml )1 = 0 whenever deg air+1 * * * ail (ml ) < m.\nFor example, suppose that k is the order of \u03b1 at zi = zj . Take a partition {1, . . . , l} =\n{1, . . . , bi, . . . , b\nj, . . . , l} \u2294 {i, j}. Then (\u03b1)n = 0 for n < di + dj + k, due to the associativity\nproperty of Section 2.2.\nWe are going to use the above terminology even when \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6l does not necessarily correspond\nto a linear functional on a vertex algebra (for some fixed integers k1 , . . . , kl ).\n\n\fOn Griess Algebras\n\n3.2\n\n11\n\nComponents of degree 0\n\nDenote by P\u0304 the set of unordered partitions of {1, . . . , l}. Clearly, we have a projection P \u220b\nP 7\u2192 P\u0304 \u2208 P\u0304.\nP\nFix some integers d1 , . . . , dl . Suppose that a function \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6l of degree \u2212 di satisfies\n(\u03b1)n (P ) = 0 for all n < 0 and P \u2208 P. Then the expansion (3.1) has a leading term (\u03b1)0 (P ). It\nis easy to see that (\u03b1)0 depends only on the unordered partion P\u0304 .\nProposition 3.1. Suppose that for every partition P = (I1 , I2 ) \u2208 P\u0304 we have a function\nP (1) (2)\nP\n(s)\n(s)\n\u03b1(P ) = j \u03b1j \u03b1j , where \u03b1j depends on the variables { zi | i \u2208 Is }, deg \u03b1j = \u2212 i\u2208Is di\n(s)\n\nand (\u03b1j )d = 0 for d < 0, s = 1, 2. Assume that for any Q \u2208 P\u0304 we have\n(\u03b1(P ))0 (Q) = (\u03b1(Q))0 (P ).\n\n(3.2)\n\nThen there is a function \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6l , kP \u2208 k, such that (\u03b1)0 (P ) = \u03b1(P ). Moreover, \u03b1 is a linear\ncombination of \u03b1(P )'s and their degree 0 components.\nProof . Introduce a linear ordering on the subsets of {1, . . . , l} such that I < J if |I| < |J|,\nand then extend it to P\u0304 so that P = {I1 , I2 } < Q = {J1 , J2 } if I1 < J1 and I1 6 I2 , J1 6 J2 .\nSet Pmin = min{ P \u2208 P\u0304 | \u03b1(P ) 6= 0 }. We will prove the existence of \u03b1 by induction on |{ P \u2208\nP\u0304 | \u03b1(P ) 6= 0 }|. If \u03b1(P ) = 0 for all P , take \u03b1 =\nP0.\nWe observe that if \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6l has degree \u2212 i di and (\u03b1)d = 0 for d < 0, then the family\nof components {\u03b1(P ) = (\u03b1)0 (P )}P \u2208P\u0304 satisfies (3.2). Also, if collections {\u03b1(P )} and {\u03b2(P )}\nsatisfy (3.2), then so does {\u03b1(P ) + \u03b2(P )}.\nNow for any P \u2208 P\u03042 set \u03b2(P ) = \u03b1(P ) \u2212 (\u03b1(Pmin ))0 (P ). Obviously, \u03b2(Pmin ) = 0, and also, if\nP <Pmin , then \u03b1(P ) = 0 and hence, using (3.2), \u03b2(P ) = \u2212(\u03b1(Pmin )0 )(P ) = \u2212(\u03b1(P )0 )(Pmin ) = 0.\nBy the above observation, the collection {\u03b2(P )} satisfies (3.2), therefore by induction, there is\na function \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a6l , such that (\u03b2)0 (P ) = \u03b2(P ) for any P \u2208 P\u0304. Now take \u03b1 = \u03b2 + \u03b1(Pmin ).\n\u0004\nRemark 3.1. We can define components (\u03b1)n (P ) and the decomposition (3.1) for partitions\nP of {1, . . . , l} into more than two parts. Suppose we know the components \u03b1(P ) for all such\npartitions P . Then one can show that the function \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6l , such that (\u03b1)0 (P ) = \u03b1(P ), can be\nreconstructed by the following formula:\nX\n\u0001\n\u03b1=\n(\u22121)|P | |P | \u2212 1 ! \u03b1(P ),\n(3.3)\nP \u2208P\u0304\n\nwhere P\u0304 is the set of all unordered partitions of {1, . . . , l} and |P | is the number of parts of\na partition P \u2208 P\u0304.\nRemark 3.2. It follows from the proof of Proposition 3.1 that instead of (3.2) it is enough to\nrequire that the components \u03b1(P ) satisfy the following property: If \u03b1(Q) = 0 for some Q \u2208 P\u0304,\nthen (\u03b1(P ))0 (Q) = 0 for every P \u2208 P\u0304.\n\n3.3\n\nRegular functions\n\nRecall that in Section 2.3 we have defined operators \u2206 and \u2206\u2217 , so that for a correlation\nfunction \u03b1f (z1 , . . . , zn ) \u2208 \u03a6l corresponding\nto a linear functional f : Vd \u2192 k and\n\u0001 elements\n\u0001\n\u2217\na1 \u2208 Vd1 , . . . , al \u2208 Vdl we have f DVd\u22121 = 0 if and only if \u2206\u03b1f = 0 and f D Vd+1 = 0 if and\nonly if \u2206\u2217 (2d1 , . . . , 2dl ) \u03b1f = 0.\nIt is easy to describe all functions \u03b1(z1 , . . . , zl ) \u2208 \u03a6l , such that \u2206\u03b1 = 0. These are the\nfunctions \u03b1 that are invariant under translations, since\n\u03b1(z1 + t, . . . , zl + t) = exp(t\u2206) \u03b1(z1 , . . . , zl ) = \u03b1(z1 , . . . , zl ).\nby the Taylor formula. In other words, such \u03b1 depends only on the differences zi \u2212 zj .\n\n\f12\n\nM. Roitman\nNow we will investigate the functions \u03b1 which are killed by \u2206\u2217 .\n\nDefinition 3.1. A function \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6l is called (n1 , . . . , nl )-regular if \u2206\u2217 (n1 , . . . , nl ) \u03b1f = 0.\nExample 3.1. For an integer symmetric l \u00d7 l matrix S = {sij } with sii = 0 define\nY\n\u03c0(S) =\n(zi \u2212 zj )sij \u2208 \u03a6l .\n\n(3.4)\n\n16i<j6l\n\nThe relations (2.14) imply that\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2206\u2217 (n1 , . . . , nl ) \u03c0(S) = (n1 + s1 )z1 + * * * + (nl + sl )z1 \u03c0(S),\n\u0001\nP\nwhere si = j sij . Therefore, \u2206\u2217 (n1 , . . . , nl ) \u03c0(S) = 0 if and only if si = \u2212ni for i = 1, . . . , l.\nIn this case the matrix S will be called (n1 , . . . , nl )-regular, so that \u03c0(S) is a regular function\nwhenever S is a regular matrix.\nRemark 3.3. One can show, though we will not use this here, that the space of regular functions\nKer \u2206\u2217 (n1 , . . . , nl ) \u2282 \u03a6l is spanned by the products \u03c0(S) where S = {sij } runs over the set of\nn1 , . . . , nl -regular matrices such that sij > kij . This description is analogous to the description of\nKer \u2206 above. Moreover, using this description, the dimensions of the homogeneous components\nof the spaces Ker \u2206\u2217 (n1 , . . . , nl ) \u2282 \u03a6l can be given a combinatorial interpretation, in fact, they\nare certain generalizations of Catalan numbers.\nAssume we have a homogeneous linear functional f : V \u2192 k such that f (D \u2217 V ) = 0, and\nthe elements ai \u2208 Vdi , i = 1, . . . , l. Then by Lemma 2.1a, we have deg f > 0, and therefore\nthe corresponding\ncorrelation function \u03b1f , given by (2.9), is (2d1 , . . . , 2dl )-regular and satisfies\nP\ndeg \u03b1f > \u2212 i di . Moreover, if deg f = 0, then also f (DV ) = 0 by Lemma 2.1b, and therefore\n\u2206\u03b1f = 0.\nLet us investigate the effect of the anti-involution u 7\u2192 u\u2217 of the enveloping algebra U (V )\n(see Section 2.5) on the correlation functions. Similarly to the series (2.9), one can consider the\nseries\n\u0001\n\u0001\u2217 \u0001\nf Y (a1 , z1 ) * * * Y (al , zl ) 1 = f Y (al , zl )\u2217 * * * Y (a1 , z1 )\u2217 1 ,\n\nwhich can be shown to converge in the domain |z1 | < * * * < |zl | to a rational function\n\u03b1\u2217f (z1 , . . . , zl ) \u2208 \u03a6l . Since f (D \u2217 ai ) = 0, we can apply the formula (2.16) to each ai (n)\u2217 and\nthen it is easy ti check that\n\u03b1\u2217f = (\u22121)d1 +***+dl z1\u22122d1 * * * zl\u22122dl \u03b1f (z1\u22121 , . . . , zl\u22121 ).\n\n(3.5)\n\nIt follows from (2.17) and the fact that f (D \u2217 V1 ) = 0 that \u03b1\u2217f = \u03b1f .\nIn Section 4.3, given a collection of integers {kij } for 1 6 i < j 6 l, we will construct a vertex\nalgebra F such that any function \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6l such that ordij \u03b1 > kij will be a correlation function\non F , therefore the above properties hold for any (2d1 , . . . , 2dl )-regular function. It follows that\nthe above properties of correlation functions hold for all functions in \u03a6l . Namely, we have the\nfollowing proposition:\nP\nl be a (2d , . . . , 2d )-regular function.

Proposition 3.2 can also be easily deduced from the fact that every regular\nfunction is aP\nlinear combination of the products \u03c0(S). Also, one can show that a function \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6l\nof degree \u2212 di is (2d1 , . . . , 2dl )-regular if and only if \u03b1\u2217 = \u03b1.\n\n\fOn Griess Algebras\n\n13\n\nP\nCorollary 3.1.

It is easy to compute using (2.16) that for any correlation function \u03b1 (and\ntherefore, for any function \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6l ) one has\n\u2206\u2217 (n1 , . . . , nl ) \u03b1\u2217 = \u2212(\u2206\u03b1)\u2217 ,\nwhere\n\u03b1\u2217 (z1 , . . . , zl ) = z1\u2212n1 * * * zl\u2212nl \u03b1(z1\u22121 , . . . , zl\u22121 ).\nAs before, this can be easily computed without any reference to vertex algebras.\n\n3.4\n\nAdmissible functions\n\nIn this section by \"regular\" we mean (4, . . . , 4)-regular, and set \u2206\u2217 = \u2206\u2217 (4, . . . , 4).\nDefinition 3.2. A regular function \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6l is called admissible if for every partition {1, . . . , l} =\nI \u2294 J we have (\u03b1)n = 0 for n < 0 or n = 1. If also (\u03b1)0 = 0 for all partitions, then \u03b1 is called\nindecomposable.\nDenote the space of all admissible functions in l variables by Rl \u2282 \u03a6l , and the space of all\nindecomposable admissible functions by R0l \u2282 Rl .\nWe have R1 = 0, R2 = k(z1 \u2212 z2 )\u22124 , R3 = R03 = k (z1 \u2212 z2 )\u22122 (z1 \u2212 z3 )\u22122 (z2 \u2212 z3 )\u22122 , and it is\neasy to compute, using e.g. the representation of regular functions by the products \u03c0(S), that\ndim R04 = 3, dim R4 = 6, dim R05 = 16, dim R5 = 26 (compare with Section 5.4 below).\nWe establish here a few simple properties of admissible functions. Recall that the operators\n(k)\n\u03c1ij : \u03a6l \u2192 \u03a6l\u22121 where defined in (2.11).\nProposition 3.3. Let \u03b1 \u2208 Rl , l > 3 and 1 6 i < j 6 l.\na. ordij \u03b1 > \u22124 and if \u03b1 \u2208 R0l , then ordij \u03b1 > \u22122.\n(\u22124)\n\nb. \u03c1ij\n\n(\u22123)\n\n\u03b1 \u2208 Rl\u22122 , \u03c1ij\n\n(\u22122)\n\n\u03b1 = 0 and \u03c1ij\n\n\u03b1 \u2208 Rl\u22121 .\n\nc. The function \u03b1 can be uniquely written as a linear combination of the products of indecomposable admissible functions.\nThe product in (c) is understood in terms of the operation \u03a6l \u2297 \u03a6m \u2192 \u03a6l+m defined in\nSection 2.2.\nProof . To simplify notations, suppose (i, j) = (l \u2212 1, l). Consider the expansion (2.10) for\nthe function \u03b1(z1 , . . . , zl ) \u2208 Rl . If we expand every coefficient \u03b1k (z1 , . . . , zl\u22121 ) in the power\nseries in zl\u22121 around 0, we will get exactly the component expansion (3.1) for the partition\n{1, . . . , l \u2212 2} \u2294 {l \u2212 1, l}. Then the minimal component is\n(\u03b1)k0 +4 = \u03b1k0 (z1 , . . . , zl\u22122 , 0) (zl\u22121 \u2212 zl )k0 ,\nwhere k0 = ordl\u22121,l \u03b1. This shows that k0 > \u22124 and, since (\u03b1)1 = 0, we have k0 6= \u22123. Also,\nif \u03b1 is indecomposable, then k0 > 2, which proves (a).\nNow assume that k0 = \u22124. Then we have\n\u0010 \u2202\u03b1\n\u0011\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u22124\n0 = (\u03b1)1 =\nzl\u22121 (zl\u22121 \u2212 zl )\u22124 + \u03b13 z =0 (zl\u22121 \u2212 zl )\u22123 .\nl\u22121\n\u2202zl\u22121 zl\u22121 =0\n\n\f14\n\nM. Roitman\n\nTherefore, \u03b1\u22124 does not depend on zl\u22121 and \u03b13 = 0 since \u03b13 \u2208 \u03a6l\u22121 . Since \u03b1 does not have\ncomponents of negative degrees or of degree 1, neither do \u03b1\u22122 and \u03b1\u22124 . To prove (b) we are left\nto show that \u03b1\u22122 and \u03b1\u22124 are regular.\nWe have just seen that the expansion (2.10) for \u03b1 has form\n\u0001\n\u03b1 = \u03b1\u22124 (z1 , . . . , zl\u22122 ) (zl\u22121 \u2212 zl )\u22124 + \u03b1\u22122 (z1 , . . . , zl\u22121 ) (zl\u22121 \u2212 zl )\u22122 + O (zl \u2212 zl\u22121 )\u22121 .\n\nApplying \u2206\u2217 to this and using (2.14) we get\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n0 = \u2206\u2217 \u03b1 = \u2206\u22172 \u03b1\u22124 (zl\u22121 \u2212 zl )\u22124 + \u2206\u22171 \u03b1\u22122 (zl\u22121 \u2212 zl )\u22122 + O (zl \u2212 zl\u22121 )\u22121 ,\n\nwhere \u2206\u2217s = \u2206\u2217 (4, . . . , 4) (l \u2212 s times), s = 1, 2, which proves regularity of \u03b1\u22122 and \u03b1\u22124 .\nThe proof of (c) is very similar\na partition P =(I1 , I2 )\u2208P\u0304.\nP to the proof of Proposition 3.1.

Also,\nby Proposition 3.3c we can always assume that \u03b1m is a product of indecomposable admissible\nfunctions.\nProof . We use induction on l. If l = 2 (respectively, 3), then \u03b1 is a multiple of (z1 \u2212 z2 )\u22124\n(respectively, (z1 \u2212 z2 )\u22122 (z1 \u2212 z3 )\u22122 (z2 \u2212 z3 )\u22122 ) and we take \u03b1 = \u03b11 . So assume that l > 4.\nTo simplify notations, assume that i = 1. We also use induction on the number of multiple\npoles of \u03b1 as z1 \u2212 zj , j = 2, . . . , l, counting multiplicity.\nAssume first that \u03b1 has a pole of order 4 at one of z1 \u2212 zj 's, which without loss of generality\nwe can assume to be z1 \u2212 z2 . Then set\n(\u22124)\n\n\u03b3 = (z1 \u2212 z2 )\u22124 \u03c112 \u03b1.\nObviously, \u03b3 \u2208 Rl and satisfies (i). Since \u03b3 does not have poles at z1 \u2212 zj , z2 \u2212 zj for j > 3,\nand (2.12) implies that ordij \u03b3 > ordij \u03b1 for all 3 6 i < j 6 l, \u03b3 satisfies (ii) as well. P\nTherefore,\n\u2032 =\n\u2032\nthe function \u03b1\u2032 = \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b3 \u2208 Rl has fewer multiple poles\nat\nz\n\u2212\nz\n.\nBy\ninduction,\n\u03b1\n1\nj\nm \u03b1m for\nP\n\u03b1m \u2208 Rl satisfying (i) and (ii), and hence \u03b1 = \u03b3 + m \u03b1\u2032m .\nNow assume that \u03b1 has a double pole at some z1 \u2212 zj , which is again can be taken z1 \u2212 z2 .\nP\n(\u22122)\nThen set \u03b2(z2 , . . . , zl ) = \u03c1ij \u03b1 \u2208 Rl\u22121 . By induction, we have \u03b2 = m \u03b2m , where the functions\n\u03b2m \u2208 Rl\u22121 satisfy conditions (i) and (ii) for zi = z2 . For each \u03b2m , we need to consider two cases,\nthat correspond to the dichotomy of the condition (i):\nCase 1. The function \u03b2m has a pole of order 4 at some z2 \u2212 zj for j = 3, . . . , l. Without loss\n\u2032 for some \u03b2 \u2032 \u2208 Rl\u22123 , and\nof generality, we can assume that j = 3. Then \u03b2m = (z2 \u2212 z3 )(\u22124) \u03b2m\nm\nwe set\n\u2032\n\u03b3m = (z1 \u2212 z2 )\u22122 (z1 \u2212 z3 )\u22122 (z2 \u2212 z3 )\u22122 \u03b2m\n.\n\n(3.7)\n\nCase 2. The function \u03b2m has poles of orders at most 2 at all z2 \u2212 zj for j = 3, . . . , l. Without\nloss of generality, we can assume that ord2j \u03b2m > 1 for j > 5. The we set\n\u03b3m = (z1 \u2212 z2 )\u22122 (z1 \u2212 z3 )\u22121 (z1 \u2212 z4 )\u22121 (z2 \u2212 z3 )(z2 \u2212 z4 )\u03b2m .\n\n(3.8)\n\n\f16\n\nM. Roitman\n\nWe need to show that in both cases the function \u03b3m is admissible, satisfies conditions (i)\n(\u22122)\nand (ii) and \u03c112 \u03b3m = \u03b2m . Indeed, assume that these properties of \u03b3m are established. Then\nP\n(\u22122)\nset \u03b1\u2032 = \u03b1 \u2212 m \u03b3m . Since \u03b3m satisfies (ii), and \u03c112 \u03b1\u2032 = 0,Pthe function \u03b1\u2032 will have less\nmultiple poles in z1 \u2212 zj than \u03b1, therefore by induction,\n\u03b1\u2032 P\n= m \u03b1\u2032m for \u03b1\u2032m \u2208 Rl satisfying\nP\nconditions (i) and (ii), and we take expansion \u03b1 = m \u03b3m + m \u03b1\u2032m .\n(\u22122)\nNote that the conditions (i) and \u03c112 \u03b3m = \u03b2m are obvious in both cases.\nCase 1 is similar to the case when ord12 \u03b1 = \u22124. We see that \u03b3m is admissible by the\ndefinition. Since ord23 \u03b2 = \u22124 and ord12 \u03b1 = \u22122, we must have ord13 \u03b1 6 \u22122, which together\nwith (2.12) establishes the property (ii) for \u03b3m .\nSo assume we are in Case 2. Condition (ii) follows from (2.12) and the fact that the only\nmultiple pole of \u03b3m at z1 \u2212 zj and z2 \u2212 zj is at z1 \u2212 z2 . We are left to show that \u03b3m is admissible.\nAs it was mentioned above, we can assume\nP that \u03b2m = \u03b2m1 \u03b2m2 * * * is a product of indecomposable admissible functions \u03b2mt \u2208 Rlt ,\nt lt = l \u2212 1. Suppose \u03b2l1 depends on z2 . Then\nl1 > 2, since ord23 \u03b2m = \u22122. Since our choice of z3 and z4 was based only on the condition that\nord2j \u03b2m > \u22121 for j 6= 3, 4, we can assume that \u03b2m1 depends on z3 and z4 . Therefore, in order\nto prove that \u03b3m is admissible, it is enough to show that if \u03b2m is indecomposable admissible,\nthen so is \u03b3m .\nSo assume that \u03b2m \u2208 R0l\u22121 . Applying \u2206\u2217 to \u03b3m and using (2.14) and the fact that \u03b2m is\nregular, we see that \u03b3m is regular as well. So we are left to verify that for every partition\n{1, . . . , l} = I \u2294 J we have (\u03b3m )n = 0 for n 6 1.\nUsing Corollary 3.1, we can assume without loss of generality that 1 \u2208 I; otherwise we could\nswap I and J. Let\nX\n(\u03b2m )n =\n(\u03b2m )\u2032\u2212n,j (\u03b2m )\u2032\u2032n,j\nj\n\n\u0001\nbe the component of \u03b2m corresponding to partition {2, . . . , l} = I\\{1} \u2294 J. Since \u03b2m \u2208 R0l\u22121 ,\nwe have (\u03b2m )n = 0 for n 6 1. We can expand the factor\n\u03ba = (z1 \u2212 z2 )\u22122 (z1 \u2212 z3 )\u22121 (z1 \u2212 z4 )\u22121 (z2 \u2212 z3 )(z2 \u2212 z4 )\n\b\nP\nin (3.8) as \u03ba = s \u03bas\u2032 \u03bas\u2032\u2032 , \bwhere \u03bas\u2032 depends on the variables zi i \u2208 I \u2229 {1, 2, 3, 4} and \u03bas\u2032\u2032\ndepends on the variables zi i \u2208 J \u2229 {1, 2, 3, 4} , so that deg \u03bas\u2032\u2032 > 0. We use here that z1\nappears in \u03bas\u2032 . Then the decomposition (3.1) for \u03b3m becomes\nX\n\nn,j,s\n\n\u03bas\u2032 (\u03b2m )\u2032\u2212n,j\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\n\u03bas\u2032\u2032 (\u03b2m )\u2032\u2032n,j ,\n\ntherefore, (\u03b3m )n = 0 for n 6 1.\n\n\u0004\n\nThe proof of Proposition 3.4 is very similar to the proof of Lemma 3.1.\nProof of Proposition 3.4. We use induction on the number of non-zero functions among\n(k)\n{ \u03b1ij | k = \u22122, \u22124, 1 6 i < j 6 l }. If all of them are 0, then take \u03b1 = 0.\n(\u22124)\n\nAssume first that some \u03b1ij\n(\u22124)\n\n\u03b3 = (z1 \u2212 z2 )\u22124 \u03b112\n\n(\u22124)\n\n6= 0. To simplify notations, we can take \u03b112\n\n6= 0. Then set\n\n\u2208 Rl .\n\nAs before, we see that \u03b3 does not have poles at (z1 \u2212 zj ), (z2 \u2212 zj ) for j > 3 and ordij \u03b3 > ordij \u03b1\n(k)\n(k)\nfor 3 6 i < j 6 l, therefore the collection {\u03b1ij \u2212 \u03c1ij \u03b3} has fewer non-zero terms.

Then by Lemma 3.1, we can write \u03b2(z2 , . . . , zl ) = m \u03b2m for some\nfunctions \u03b2m \u2208 Rl\u22121 satisfying the conditions (i) and (ii) of Lemma 3.1 for zi = z2 . Exactly as\nin the proof of Lemma 3.1, without loss of generality we can consider two cases for each \u03b2m :\nwhen \u03b2m has a pole of order 4 at z2 \u2212 z3 and when \u03b2m might have double poles at z2 \u2212 z3 and\nz2 \u2212 z4 but at most simple poles at z2 \u2212 zj for j > 5. In each of these cases define the function \u03b3m\nby the formulas (3.7) and (3.8) respectively. As before, we see each \u03b3m is admissible, satisfies\nP\n(\u22122)\nthe property (ii) of Lemma 3.1 and \u03c112 \u03b3m = \u03b2m .

Also, for a generator a \u2208 G\nof degree d we have dim Vda = 1, since Vda = (\u03a9a0 )\u2217 and \u03a9a0 = k due to (\u03a90). We can identify the\nonly element of Bda with a so that \u03b1a = 1 \u2208 \u03a9a0 .\nWe define the operators D : V \u03bb \u2192 V \u03bb and D \u2217 : V \u03bb \u2192 V \u03bb as the duals to \u2206 : \u03a9a \u2192 \u03a9a and\n\u2217\n\u2206 (2 deg a1 , . . . , 2 deg al ) : \u03a9a \u2192 \u03a9a respectively (see Section 2.3). Since \u2206\u2217 (2 deg a)\u03a9a \u2282 zk[z],\nwe have D \u2217 a = 0 for every a \u2208 G.\nNow we are going to define vertex algebra structure Y : V \u2192 Hom(V, V ((z))) so that for any\n\u03bb = a1 + * * * + al \u2208 Z+ [G] we have\nX\nY (a1 , z1 ) * * * Y (al , zl )1 =\n\u03b1u (z1 , . . . , zl ) u,\n(4.2)\nu\u2208B\u03bb\n\n\u0001\nY (a1 , z1 + z) * * * Y (al , zl + z) w = Y Y (a1 , z1 ) * * * Y (al , zl )1, z w.\n\n(4.3)\n\nThese identities are to be understood in the following sense. The left-hand side of (4.2) converges\nto the V -valued rational function on the right-hand side in the region |z1 | > |z2 | > * * * > |zl |.\nThe left and right-hand sides of (4.3) converge to the same V -valued rational function in the\nregions |z1 + z| > |z2 + z| > * * * > |zl + z| and |z| > |z1 | > |z2 | > * * * > |zl | respectively.\nTake, as before, \u03bb = a1 + * * * + al \u2208 Z+ [G] and a = a1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 al \u2208 T (G). Let a \u2208 G be\na generator of degree d.

Let \u03a9 = a\u2208T (G) \u03a9a be a homogeneous space of rational functions, satisfying the\nconditions (\u03a90)\u2013(\u03a94) of Section 4.1. Then it also satisfies (\u03a95).\nBefore proving this lemma, let us show how condition (\u03a95) helps to construct the vertex\nalgebra structure on V , and hence proving Theorem 4.1. Take two weights \u03bb = a1 + * * * + al ,\n\u03bc = b1 + * * * + bk \u2208 Z+ [G], and define the tensors a = a1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 al , b = b1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 bk \u2208 T (G). We\nare going to define the action of Y (V \u03bb , z) on V \u03bc and then by linearity extend Y to the whole V .\nIn analogy with deriving (4.4), we obtain from (4.5) that every basic function \u03b1v \u2208 \u03a9a\u2297b has\nexpansion\n\u03b1v (z1 + z, . . . , zl + z, y1 , . . . , yk )\nX\n=\ncvu,w z deg v\u2212deg u\u2212deg w \u03b1u (z1 , . . . zl ) \u03b1w (y1 , . . . , yk ),\n\n(4.6)\n\nu\u2208B\u03bb , w\u2208B\u03bc\n\nfor some cvu,w \u2208 k. Now we set for u \u2208 B \u03bb and w \u2208 B \u03bc\nX\nY (u, z) w =\ncvu,w z deg v\u2212deg u\u2212deg w v.\nv\u2208B\u03bb+\u03bc\n\nTo check (4.3), sum (4.6) over all v \u2208 B \u03bb+\u03bc . By (4.2), the left-hand is\nY (a1 , z1 + z) * * * Y (al , zl + z)Y (b1 , y1 ) * * * Y (bk , yk )1,\n\nwhereas the right-hand side is, using the definition of Y (u, z) w and (4.2),\nX\nY (u, z)w \u03b1u (z1 , . . . , zl ) \u03b1w (y1 , . . . , yk )\nu\u2208B\u03bb , w\u2208B\u03bc\n\n\u0001\n= Y Y (a1 , z1 ) * * * Y (al , zl )1, z Y (b1 , y1 ) * * * Y (bk , yk )1.\n\nIt remains to be seen that the map Y : V \u2192 Hom(V, V ((z))) defines a structure of vertex\nalgebra on V . By the construction, Y satisfies (2.2) and (2.3), and the identity (4.2) guarantees\nthat the correlation functions for Y satisfy the rationality and commutativity conditions, which,\nas it was observed in Section 2.2, are enough for V to be a vertex algebra.\nNoteP\nalso that Y does not depend on the choice of the bases B \u03bb , since it depends only on the\n\u0004\ntensors u\u2208B\u03bb u \u2297 \u03b1u \u2208 Vd\u03bb \u2297 \u03a9a.\nd\n\nIt is easy to see that the vertex algebra V = V (\u03a9) has the following universality property:\n\nProposition 4.1. Let U be a vertex algebra, generated by the set G \u2282 U , such that the coalgebra\nof generating functions \u03a9(U ) (given by Definition 4.1) is a subspace of \u03a9. Then there is a unique\nvertex algebra homomorphism V \u2192 U that fixes G.\nRemark 4.2. In Section 4.1 we have constructed a vertex coalgebra \u03a9 = \u03a9(V ) of correlation\nfunctions of a vertex algebra\nL V (see Definition 4.1). If we apply the construction of Theorem 4.1\nto this \u03a9, we get V (\u03a9) = \u03bb\u2208Z+ [G] V \u03bb , which is the graded deformation algebra (a.k.a. the Rees\nalgebra) of V .\n\n\fOn Griess Algebras\n\n4.3\n\n21\n\nExample: Free vertex algebra\n\nClearly the conditions (\u03a90)\u2013(\u03a94) are satisfied for\n\u03a9a = { \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6l | ordij \u03b1 > \u2212loc(ai , aj ) \u22001 6 i < j 6 l }\u0393a .\nBy Proposition 4.1, the resulting vertex algebra F = Floc (G) = V (\u03a9), given by Theorem 4.1,\nhas the following universal property: any vertex algebra U generated by the set G such that\nthe locality of any a, b \u2208 G is at most loc(a, b), is a homomorphic image of F . Such a vertex\nalgebra F is called a free vertex algebra. It was constructed in [22, 23] using different methods.\n\n4.4\n\nProof of Lemma 4.1\n\nwith poles at zi \u2212 zj only, \u03b1 has\nTake some \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a9a\nd . As it is the case with any rational function\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\nan expansion (4.5). We just have to show that \u03b1\u2032ni \u2208 \u03a9a and \u03b1\u2032\u2032ni \u2208 \u03a9a .\n\u2032\u2032\nFirst we show that any \u03b1\u2032\u2032ni in (4.5) belongs to \u03a9a . Let \u03b1\u2032\u2032 (zk+1 , . . . , zl ) be the coefficient of\n\u2032\u2032\nsome monomial z \u2212n\u22121 z1\u2212n1 \u22121 * * * zk\u2212nk \u22121 in (4.5). Clearly, it is enough to show that this \u03b1\u2032\u2032 \u2208 \u03a9a .\nThe idea is that \u03b1\u2032\u2032 is a finite linear combination of the coefficients of z1\u2212m1 \u22121 * * * zk\u2212mk \u22121 in the\n\u2032\u2032\nexpansion of \u03b1 in the domain |z1 | > * * * > |zl |, which are in \u03a9a by (\u03a94\u2032 ). While this can be shown\nby some manipulations with rational functions, we will use some vertex algebra considerations.\nNamely, we are going to use the free vertex algebra F = Floc (G), discussed in Section 4.3.\nSince every function \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6l satisfying (\u03a91) is a correlation function on F , there is a linear\nfunctional f : Fda \u2192 k such that \u03b1 = \u03b1f is the correlation function of f , given by (2.9). By\nthe associativity property (see Section 2.2), we have that \u03b1\u2032\u2032 = \u03b1f \u2032\u2032 is the\u0001 correlation func\u2032\u2032\ntion of the functional f \u2032\u2032 : Fda\u2032\u2032 \u2192 k, given by v 7\u2192 f (a1 (n1 ) * * * ak (nk )1)(n)v , where d\u2032\u2032 = d \u2212\ndeg(a1 (n1 ) * * * ak (nk )1)(n). Using the identity (2.5), we see that (a1 (n1 ) * * * ak (nk )1)(n) as an op\u2032\u2032\nerator Fda\u2032\u2032 \u2192 Fda can be represented as a linear combination of words u = ai1 (m1 ) * * * aik (mk ) \u2208\nU (F ) for some mi \u2208 Z and a permutation \u03c3 = (i1 , . . . , ik ) \u2208 \u03a3k . But the correlation function of\nk \u22121\n1 \u22121\nin the expansion of\nthe functional v 7\u2192 f (uv) for such u is the coefficient of zi\u2212m\n* * * zi\u2212m\n1\nk\n\u2032\u2032\n\u03c3\u03b1 in the domain |zi1 | > * * * > |zik | > |zk+1 | > * * * > |zl |, and therefore belongs to \u03a9a by (\u03a94\u2032 ).\nRemark 4.3. Actually, one can show that it suffices to use only words u with \u03c3 = 1.\n\u2032\n\nNow we prove that \u03b1\u2032ni \u2208 \u03a9a . Recall that \u03c3\u03a9a = \u03a9\u03c3a for any permutation \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3l . Apply the\npermutation that reverses the order of variables to (4.5), replace z by \u2212z, and then the above\nargument shows that the expansion of \u03b1(z1 , . . . , zk , zk+1 \u2212 z, . . . , zl \u2212 z) in z at \u221e has form\nX\nX\n\u03b1\ne\u2032ni (z1 , . . . , zk ) \u03b1\ne\u2032\u2032ni (zk+1 , . . . , zl ),\nz \u2212n\u22121\n\u03b1(z1 , . . . , zk , zk+1 \u2212 z, . . . , zl \u2212 z) =\nn>n0\n\ni\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere \u03b1\ne\u2032ni \u2208 \u03a9a .

The main example of the coalgebra \u03a90 that satisfies the assumptions of Theorem 4.2 is obtained in the following way. In the setup of Section 4.1, suppose that deg ai > 0.\nFor any a = a1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 al \u2208 T (G) define \u03a9a\n0 = { \u03b1f | f : V0 \u2192 k, f (Rad V ) = 0 }.

The condition (3.2) follows from the fact that ab \u2297 cd = ac \u2297 bd in Sym2X X for every a, b, c, d \u2208 X.\nSo by Proposition 3.1 there exists a function\n\u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6a such that (\u03b1)0 (P ) = \u03b1(P ) for any\nP\n\u22121\na\npartition P \u2208 P\u0304.

Recall that the augmentation ideal X =\nl>0 Xl of V0 is graded,\nwhere\nM\nXl =\nV0a.\na\u2208T (G), |a|=l\n\nFor v \u2208 Xl we will call l = |v| the length of v. Choose a homogeneous basis X \u2282 X of X\nmodulo X 2 . We want to show that V0 \u223c\n= k[X ]. Note that we can extend the grading on X to\nthe grading on k[X ].\nConsider the canonical map \u03c6 : k[X ] \u2192 V0 , that maps every element x \u2208 X into itself. We\nneed to show that \u03c6 is an isomorphism. It is easy to see that \u03c6 is surjective \u2013 this follows from\nthe fact that for fixed length l, we have Xl \u2229 X k = 0 for k \u226b 0.\nLet X\u0304 = X k[X ] be the augmentation ideal of k[X ]. Consider the map \u03c8 : X\u0304 2 \u2192 Sym2X X\nthat maps a monomial x1 * * * xk to x1 \u2297 \u03c6(x2 * * * xk ) for xi \u2208 X . Note that the space Sym2X X is\ngraded by the length.\nThe restriction \u03c6 : X\u0304i \u2192 Xi is an isomorphism for the minimal i, because then Xi = X\u0304i =\nSpan{ x \u2208 X | |x| = i }. Assume we have\n\u0001 established that \u03c6 : X\u0304i \u2192 Xi is an isomorphism for\n2\n2\ni 6 l \u2212 1. Then \u03c8 : X\u0304i \u2192 SymX X i is an isomorphism for i 6 l. Combining this with the\nisomorphism of Lemma 4.2, we get an isomorphism X\u0304i2 \u223c\n= Xi2 for i 6 l. But if p \u2208 X\u0304l is such\n2\nthat \u03c6(p) = 0, then p \u2208 X\u0304 , since X \u222a {1} is linearly independent modulo X 2 , therefore we\nmust have p \u2261 0 and X\u0304l \u223c\n\u0004\n= Xl .\n\n5\n5.1\n\nOZ vertex algebras\nSome notations\n\nAssume we have a vertex algebra V graded as V = V0 \u2295 V2 \u2295 V3 \u2295 * * * .

Indeed, V is a V0 -module under the action av = a(\u22121)v for\na \u2208 V0 and v \u2208 V , and the identity (V4) of Definition 2.1 implies that this action commutes with\nthe vertex algebra structure on V .

Then \u03b1 \u2208 Rl . Indeed, \u03b1 is regular, since D \u2217 V1 = 0 (see\nSection 3.3), has (\u03b1)n = 0 for n < 0 or n = 1 because Vn = 0 for these n (see Section 3.1),\n(k)\nhas poles of order at most 4 since loc(a, b) = 4 for any a, b \u2208 A and has \u03c1ij \u2208 Rl+k/2 for\n(\u22124)\n\nk = \u22122, \u22124 by the associativity property of correlation functions.

If \u03c9 \u2208 V2 is a Virasoro element, then by (2.15) we have [a(m), \u03c9(\u22121) ] = (m + 1) a(m \u2212\n2) + \u03b4m,3 h\u03c9 | ai for any a \u2208 A, which implies\n[Y (a, z), \u03c9(\u22121) ] = (2z \u22122 \u2212 z \u22121 \u2202z ) Y (a, z) + h\u03c9 | ai z \u22124 1.\nTherefore,\n\u03b1(z1 , . . . , zl\u22121 , 0) = f Y (a1 , z1 ) * * * Y (al\u22121 , zl\u22121 ) \u03c9(\u22121)1\n\u0001\n= Ef Y (a1 , z1 ) * * * Y (al\u22121 , zl\u22121 )1\n+\n\n\u0001\n\nl\u22121\nX\n\u0001\n(ai , zi ) * * * Y (al\u22121 , zl\u22121 ) 1\nh\u03c9 | ai i zi\u22124 f Y (a1 , z1 ) * * * Y \\\ni=1\n\nl\u22121\n\nX\n1\n= E\u03b2(z1 , . . . , zl\u22121 ) +\nzi\u22124 \u03b2i (z1 , . . . , zbi , . . . , zl\u22121 ),\n2\ni=1\n\nand we get (5.6) since \u03b1(z1 , . . . , zl ) = \u03b1(z1 \u2212 zl , . . . , zl\u22121 \u2212 zl , 0) by Proposition 3.2.\nConversely, in order to see that \u03c9 \u2208 A is a Virasoro element, we need to show that ad \u03c9(1) :\nU (V ) \u2192 U (V ) is the grading derivation and ad \u03c9(0) : U (V ) \u2192 U (V ) coincides with D. Since A\ngenerates V as a vertex algebra, the operators a(n) for a \u2208 A, n \u2208 Z, generate U (V ) as an\nassociative algebra, and therefore it is enough to verify commutation relations between \u03c9(m)\nand a(n) for m = 0, 1 and n \u2208 Z.

Its kernel Ker \u03c0 is an ideal in B\nb0 , which by Proposition 2.2c\nalgebra homomorphism \u03c0 : B\nb So we finally set\ncan be extended to an ideal Ker \u03c0 \u2282 B.\nb\nB = B/Ker\n\u03c0.\n\nThe condition (a) holds by the construction: indeed, given a = a1 \u2297 a2 \u2297 a3 \u2297 * * * \u2208 T (A), and\n(\u22122)\na correlation function \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a9a, the coefficient \u03c112 \u03b1 is the correlation function corresponding\nto (a1 a2 ) \u2297 a3 \u2297 * * * , but\n\u0001 by the associativity condition of Section 2.2 it must be the correlation\nfunction for a1 (1)a2 \u2297 a3 \u2297 * * * , which implies that a1 (1)a2 = a1 a2 . The equality a1 (3)a2 =\nha1 | a2 i is established in the same way.\nis given by the formula (5.6),\nIf 12 \u03c9 \u2208 A is a unit, then any correlation function \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a9a\u2297\u03c9\n0\ntherefore, \u03c9 is a Virasoro element by Proposition 5.1, thus proving (b). Note also that the\nconstruction of B was canonical, which establishes (c).\nProof of Theorem 6.1d\nWe need to introduce another vertex algebra. Let F = V (\u03a9(F )) be the vertex algebra obtained\nby the construction of Theorem 4.2 from the space of functions\nM\n\u03a9(F )0 =\n\u03a9(F )g0 ,\ng\u2208T (G\\{\u03c9})\n\nwhere \u03a9(F )g0 = (S l )\u0393g is the space of \u0393g -symmetric admissible functions with only simple poles\n(see Example 4.1). By Theorem 4.3 the algebra F0 is polynomial. Note that\n\b the algebra F is\nwhat Theorem 6.1 would yield if instead of A one would take the space Span G\\{\u03c9} with zero\nproduct and form.\nOn the other hand, the vertex L\nalgebra B inherits a filtration (6.1) from B0 . Consider the\nassociated graded algebra gr B = l>1 B (l) /B (l\u22121) . This is indeed a vertex algebra, since all\nvertex algebra identities (see Definition 2.1) are homogeneous. By (B5) we have\nM\ngr B =\n(gr B)\u03bb .\n\u03bb\u2208Z+ [G\\{\u03c9}]\n\n\f34\n\nM. Roitman\n\nFrom the construction in Section 6.2 it follows that the coalgebra of correlation functions\n\u03a9(gr B)0 is the same as \u03a9(F )0 , therefore \u03a9(gr B) = \u03a9(F ) and hence by Proposition 4.1 there is\na vertex algebra isomorphism \u03b7 : (gr B) \u2192 F , which yields algebra isomorphism \u03b70 : (gr B)0 =\ngr(B0 ) \u2192 F0 . But since a polynomial algebra cannot have non-trivial deformations, we must\nhave B0 \u223c\n= F0 as associative commutative algebras.\nWe are left with estimating the size of F0 . Take some g = a1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 al \u2208 T (G\\{\u03c9}) and let\n\u0393 = \u0393g . A function \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a9g0 = (S l )\u0393 can have a pole at zi \u2212 zj only if ai 6= aj . Therefore, since\ndeg \u03b1 = \u22122l, if G has no more than one element other than \u03c9, then (S l )\u0393 = 0 for l > 0, and\nhence F0 = k.\nNow assume that G has at least two elements other then \u03c9, say a and b. Denote by S0l \u2282 S l\nthe space of indecomposable admissible functions with only simple poles. Then the span of the\ngenerators of degree g of F0 is isomorphic to (S0l )\u0393 . We claim that for l large enough there is\ng \u2208 T (G\\{\u03c9}), |g| = l, such that the (S0l )\u0393 6= 0. This would imply that F0 is a polynomial\nalgebra in infinitely many variables.\nIndeed, there are infinitely many bipartite 4-regular connected graphs that remain connected\nafter a removal of any two edges. Let G be such a graph with vertices u1 , . . . , uk , vk+1 , . . . , vl ,\nso that an edge can only connect some ui with some vj . The incidence matrix of this graph\nis an l \u00d7 l symmetric regular matrix S = {sij }li,j=1 (see Example 3.1), defined so that sij = \u22121\nwhenever G has an edge connecting ui and vj for some 1 6 i 6 k < j 6 l, the rest of the entries\nbeing 0.
