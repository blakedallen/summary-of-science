They appear in many combinatorial problems as they enumerate a great quantity of\ncombinatorial objects. For instance, Fibonacci numbers are involved in the\ntiling of a strip, in rabbits' population growth, in bees' ancestors, . . . , while\nCatalan numbers occur in the enumeration of several kinds of paths, trees,\npermutations, polyominoes and other combinatorial structures. Fibonacci\nnumbers are described by the famous recurrence:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 F0 = 1\nF1 = 1\n\uf8f3\nFn = Fn\u22121 + Fn\u22122\n1\n\n\ffrom which the generating function:\nF (x) =\n\n1\n1 \u2212 x \u2212 x2\n\narises, and the sequence begins with 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . .. Catalan\nnumbers have been deeply studied, too: they appear in many relations, also\nconnected to other sequences or by themselves. They are defined by:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 C0 = 1\nC1 = 1\nPn\u22121\n\uf8f3\nCn\u22121\u2212iCi\nCn = i=0\nThe expression\n\u0012 \u0013\n2n\n1\n,\nCn =\nn+1 n\n\nwith n \u2265 0,\n\nderived from the generating function\nC(x) =\n\n1+\n\n\u221a\n\n1 \u2212 4x\n,\n2x\n\nis a closed formula for them and the sequence begins with the numbers\n1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, . . ..\nOur question is: \"What is there between Fibonacci and Catalan numbers?\" For instance the following sequences:\n\u2022 {cn }n\u22650 = {1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, . . .}, (c0 = 1, c1 = 1, c2 = 2, cn = cn\u22121 +\ncn\u22122 + cn\u22123 ) Tribonacci numbers;\n\u2022 {tn }n\u22650 = {1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 2, . . . , 2n\u22121}, (t0 = 1, tn = 2n\u22121 );\n\u2022 {pn }n\u22650 = {1, 1, 2, 5, 12, 29, 70, . . .}, (p0 = 1, p1 = 1, p2 = 2, pn =\n2pn\u22121 + pn\u22122 ) Pell numbers;\n\u2022 {F\u0304n }n\u22650 = {1, 1, 2, 5, 13, 34, 89, . . .}, (F\u03040 = 1, F\u03041 = 1, F\u0304n = 3F\u0304n\u22121 +\nF\u0304n\u22122 ) even index Fibonacci numbers,\n2\n\n\f(for more details see the sequences M1074, M1129, M1413, M1439 in [Sl],\nrespectively, where they are defined with different initial conditions)\nlay between Fibonacci and Catalan numbers (we call the last sequence even\nindex Fibonacci numbers while other authors call them odd index Fibonacci\nnumbers, but this depends on the initials conditions assumed for the Fibonacci sequence). We are looking for a unifying combinatorial interpretation\nfor all these sequences, and others too. To this aim we will use permutations\navoiding forbidden subsequences. Our results can be extended to paths and\ntrees.\nThe main idea we are going to base on, has already been used in [BDPP1].\nHere, here we briefly recall that. It is well known that |Sn (123, 213, 312)| =\nFn and |Sn (123)| = Cn , as mentioned in the abstract. The patterns 213 and\n312, which are not present in the second equality, can be seen as particular\ncases of more general patterns. More precisely, 213 can be obtained from the\npattern rk = k(k \u2212 1)(k \u2212 2) . . . 21(k + 1) with k = 2, while 312 is the pattern\nqk = 1(k + 1)k(k \u2212 1) . . . 21 with k = 2, again. When k grows, the patterns rk\nand qk increase their length, then in the limit (k grows to \u221e) they can be not\nconsidered in the enumeration of the permutations \u03c0 of Sn (123, rk , qk ) since,\nfor each n \u2265 0, any \u03c0 does not surely contain a pattern of infinite length. In\nother words, starting from the case k = 2 (involving Fibonacci numbers), for\neach k > 2 we provide a class of pattern avoiding permutations where the\npattern are suitably generalized in order to make them \"disappear\" when\nk grows, leading to the class S(123) enumerated by the Catalan numbers.\nWe say that there is a sort of \"continuity\" between Fibonacci and Catalan\nnumbers since we provide a succession of generating functions {gk (x)}k\u22652\nwith g2 (x) = F (x) and whose limit is C(x).\nAs a matter of fact, in the paper this aim is reached in two steps: first\nonly the pattern 312 is generalized so that we arrive to the class S(123, 213)\nenumerated by {2n\u22121 }, then the pattern 213 is increased in order to obtain\nthe class S(123). Nevertheless it is possible to make \"disappear\" both the\npatterns at the same time obtaining similar results.\n\n2\n\nNotations and Definitions\n\nWe denote by Sn the set of permutations on [n] = {1, 2, . . . , n}. Let \u03c0 =\n\u03c01 \u03c02 * * * \u03c0n \u2208 Sn and \u0393 = \u03b31 \u03b32 * * * \u03b3k \u2208 Sk . We say that \u03c0 does not contain a\n3\n\n\fsubsequence of kind \u0393 (or the pattern \u0393) if no sequence j1 < j2 < * * * < jk\nexists such that \u03c0ji < \u03c0jh if and only if \u03b3i < \u03b3h .\nLet Sn (\u0393) be the set of permutations not containing a subsequence of\nkind \u0393. For instance 7465312 \u2208 S7 (123) while 7154326 \u2208\n/ S7 (123) since the\nsubsequence 146 is of kind 123.\nIf\n\u0393\n,\n\u0393\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\n\u0393\nare\npermutations\nwe denote\n1 T2\nT\nT j\nby S(\u03931 , \u03932 , . . . , \u0393j ) = S(\u03931 ) S(\u03932 ) * * * S(\u0393j ) the set of permutations\non [n] that do not contain anyone of the sequences \u03931 , \u03932 , . . . , \u0393j . For instance\n6745231 \u2208 S7 (123, 132, 213) while 6475231 \u2208\n/ S7 (123, 132, 213), being the\nsequence 475 of kind 132.\nPermutations avoiding forbidden subsequences have been widely studied\nby many authors [BK, BDPP1, BDPP2, Che, Chung, EM, Gi, Gu, Kra, Kre,\nSi, St, W1, W2, W3]. A very efficient and natural method to enumerate\nclasses of permutations was proposed by Chung et al. [Chung] and Rogers\n[R], and, later, by West [W1]. It consists in generating permutations in Sn\nfrom permutations in Sn\u22121 by inserting n in all the positions such that a\nforbidden subsequence does not arise (we denote these positions by a '\u22c4').\nThese positions are known as active sites, while a site is any position between\ntwo consecutive elements in a permutation or before the first element or after\nthe last one. If a permutation in Sn\u22121 (\u03931 , . . . , \u0393j ) contains k active sites, it\ngenerates k permutations in Sn (\u03931 , . . . , \u0393j ). In the sequel, we denote the i-th\nactive site as the site located before \u03c0i .\nIn order to show how we can enumerate classes of permutations by this\nmethod, we consider the class Sn (123). Let \u03c0 = \u03c01 \u03c02 * * * \u03c0n be a permutation\nin Sn (123) such that \u03c01 > \u03c02 > * * * > \u03c0k\u22121 < \u03c0k . Then the first k sites are\nactive, since the insertion of n + 1 in one of these positions does not create a\nsubsequence of kind 123. On the contrary, the sites on the right of \u03c0k are not\nactive because the insertion of n + 1 produces the subsequence \u03c0k\u22121 \u03c0k (n + 1)\nwhich is of kind 123. Therefore, from the permutation\n\u22c4\u03c01 \u22c4 \u03c02 \u22c4 * * * \u22c4 \u03c0k\u22121 \u22c4 \u03c0k \u03c0k+1 * * * \u03c0n\n\nwe obtain the following ones:\n\n\u22c4(n + 1)\u03c01 \u22c4 \u03c02 \u22c4 * * * \u22c4 \u03c0k\u22121 \u22c4 \u03c0k \u03c0k+1 * * * \u03c0n\n\u22c4\u03c01 \u22c4 (n + 1)\u03c02 * * * * * * \u03c0n\n\u22c4\u03c01 \u22c4 \u03c02 \u22c4 (n + 1)\u03c03 * * * \u03c0n\n..\n.\n\u22c4\u03c01 \u22c4 \u03c02 \u22c4 * * * \u22c4 \u03c0k\u22121 \u22c4 (n + 1)\u03c0k * * * \u03c0n\n4\n\n\fwhich have respectively (k + 1), 2, 3, . . . , k active sites. We remark that from\na permutation \u03c0 having k active sites we obtain k permutations having (k +\n1), 2, 3, . . . , k active sites, independently from the length of the permutation.\nSuch a permutation is labelled with (k). We can \"condense\" this property\ninto a succession rule (for more details see [W2, W3]):\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 (1)\n(1)\n(2)\n(1)\n\uf8f3\n(k)\n(2)(3) * * * (k)(k + 1)\nwhere (k)\n(2)(3) * * * (k)(k + 1) is the production of a permutation \u03c0 with\nlabel (k). The label (1), said the axiom of the succession rule, is the number\nof active sites of the empty permutation \u03b5 which is the only permutation with\nlength n = 0, meaning that \u03b5 generates the minimal permutation \u03c0 = 1 with\nlength n = 1. In turn, \u03c0 = \u22c41\u22c4 has two active sites, then it produces two\npermutations: this fact is described by the second line of the rule (1)\n(2)\n(the production of the axiom).\nThe recursive construction of permutation in Sn (123) can also be represented by a generating tree, where each node is a permutation, the permutations obtained from \u03c0 appear as sons of \u03c0 and the root is the empty\npermutation \u03b5 with length n = 0. Therefore, on the n-th level we have\nall the permutations of length n (if we assume the root level is 0). The\nsuccession rule 1 relates the outdegree of each node in the tree to the outdegree of its sons. Usually, from a succession rule we can obtain a functional\nequation or a systemPof equations from which one can obtain the generating function f (x) = n\u22650 an xn where an is the number of objects on level\nn. From the above example for S(123), it is possible to obtain (we omit\nthe calculus) the generating function C(x) for Catalan numbers. Moreover,\n|Sn (123)| = Cn , for n \u2265 0.\nThe enumeration of the permutations of Sn (123, 132, 213) is also briefly\nillustrated, which is the starting point of our argument, as recalled in the\nIntroduction. In the permutations of this class only the first two sites can be\nactive: the insertion of n + 1 in another site would produce the subsequence\n\u03c01 \u03c02 (n + 1) which is of kind 123 or 213. If \u03c01 < \u03c02 then only the first site\nis active because the insertion of n + 1 in the second site would produce\nthe subsequence \u03c01 \u03c02 (n + 1) which is of kind 132. Let \u03c0 = \u03c01 \u03c02 * * * \u03c0n be\na permutation in Sn (123, 132, 213); if \u03c01 < \u03c02 , from \u22c4\u03c01 \u03c02 * * * \u03c0n we obtain\n5\n\n\f\u22c4(n+1)\u22c4\u03c01 \u03c02 * * * \u03c0n which has two active sites; if \u03c01 > \u03c02 , from \u22c4\u03c01 \u22c4\u03c02 * * * \u03c0n\nwe obtain \u22c4(n + 1) \u22c4 \u03c01 \u03c02 * * * \u03c0n and \u22c4\u03c01 (n + 1)\u03c02 * * * \u03c0n having two and one\nactive sites, respectively. This construction can be encoded by the succession\nrule:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 (1)\n(1)\n(2)\n(2)\n\uf8f3\n(2)\n(1)(2)\n\nThe above succession rule is an example of finite succession rule since only a\nlimited number of different labels appear in it. It is easily seen that it leads\nto Fibonacci numbers and |Sn (123, 213, 312)| = Fn , for n \u2265 0.\n\nIn the last part of this section, we only note that the permutations of\nthe class S(123, 213), which is the intermediate step between the above considered classes (see the Introduction), have exactly two active sites (the first\ntwo sites), so that the corresponding succession rule is\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 (1)\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n\uf8f3\n(2)\n(2)(2)\n\nIt is easy to prove that the related enumerating sequence {tn }n\u22650 is defined\nby\n\u001a\nt0 = 1\ntn = 2n\u22121 , n \u2265 1\n\nand |Sn (123, 213)| = tn . The corresponding generating function is t(x) =\n1\u2212x\n. In the sequel, we refer to this sequence simply with {2n\u22121 }n\u22650 .\n1\u22122x\nWe conclude by observing that all the considered sequences take into account the empty permutation which is enumerated by C0 , F0 and t0 . Moreover, in each presented succession rule the axiom refers to it and the production (1)\n(2) describes its behavior.\n\n3\n\nFrom Fibonacci to 2n\u22121\n\nConsider a permutation \u03c0 \u2208 Sn (123, 213, 1(k + 1)k . . . 2). His structure is\nessentially known thanks to [E], where the author analyzes the permutations\nof Sn (123, 132, k(k \u2212 1) . . . 21(k + 1)) which is equivalent to the class we are\nconsidering (the permutations of the former are the reverse complement of\n6\n\n\fthe latter). In the same paper the author shows that those permutations are\nenumerated by the sequence of k-generalized Fibonacci numbers, providing\nalso the related generating function. Here, we give an alternative proof of the\nsame facts by using the ECO method [BDPP4]. To this aim, we recall the\nstructure of the permutations referring directly to the class Sn (123, 213, 1(k +\n1)k . . . 2), nevertheless we omit the easy proofs that one can recover from [E].\nIf \u03c0 \u2208 Sn (123, 213, 1(k + 1)k . . . 2), then:\n\u2022 either \u03c01 = n or \u03c02 = n;\n\u2022 if \u03c01 = n, then \u03c0 = n\u03c4 , with \u03c4 \u2208 Sn\u22121 (123, 213, 1(k + 1)k . . . 2);\n\u2022 if \u03c02 = n, then \u03c01 = n \u2212 j, with j \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , k \u2212 1}, and \u03c0 =\n(n\u2212j)n(n\u22121) . . . (n\u2212j +1)\u03c3, with \u03c3 \u2208 Sn\u2212j\u22122 (123, 213, 1(k+1)k . . . 2).\nIf \u03c0 \u2208 Sn (123, 213, 1(k + 1)k . . . 2), denote \u03c0 (i) the permutations such that\n\u03c01 = n\u2212i. The active sites of \u03c0 are the first two sites: the insertion of n+1 in\nany other site would create the forbidden pattern 123 or 213. More precisely,\nthe permutations \u03c0 (j) with j \u2208 {0, 1, 2, . . . , k \u22122} have label (2) (the first two\nsites are active), while \u03c0 (k\u22121) has label (1) (the first site is active). The son\nof the permutation \u03c0 (k\u22121) is the permutation of Sn+1 (123, 213, 1(k + 1)k . . . 2)\nobtained from \u03c0 by inserting n + 1 in its first active site, which we denote\n\u03c0\u0304 (0) . It is easily seen that \u03c0\u0304 (0) has, in turn, label (2). The two sons of the\npermutations with label (2) are \u03c0\u0304 (0) and \u03c0\u0304 (j+1) (\u03c0\u0304 (j+1) is obtained from \u03c0 by\ninserting n + 1 in the second active site). Therefore, all these permutations\nhave, in turn, label (2) but \u03c0\u0304 (k\u22121) which has label (1). Since all the labels\n(2) have not the same production, it is suitable to label each permutation\n\u03c0 (j) (j \u2208 {0, 1, 2, . . . , k \u2212 2}) with (2j ) in order to recognize the permutation\n\u03c0 (k\u22122) whose sons have labels (1) and (2). Then, the above description can\nbe encoded by:\n\uf8f1\n(1)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n(1)\n(20 )\n(2j )\n(20 )(2j+1),\nfor j = 0, 1, 2, . . . , k \u2212 3\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n(2k\u22122)\n(20 )(1)\nWe now deduce the generating function T k (x, y) of the permutations of\nS(123, 213, 1(k + 1)k . . . 2), according to their length and number of active\nsites. To this aim we consider the subsets T1 of the permutations with label\n7\n\n\f(1) and T2j , with j = 0, 1, 2, . . . , k \u2212 2, of the permutations with label (2j ). It\nis obvious that these subsets\nP form a partition of S(123, 213, 1(k + 1)k . . . 2).\nDenote with T1 (x, y) = \u03c0\u2208T1 xn(\u03c0) y f (\u03c0) the generating function of T1 and\nP\nT2j (x, y) = \u03c0\u2208T2 xn(\u03c0) y f (\u03c0) the generating function of T2j (j = 0, 1, . . . , k \u2212\nj\n2), where n(\u03c0) and f (\u03c0) are the length and the number of active sites of a\npermutation \u03c0, respectively. From the above succession rule the following\nsystem is derived:\n\uf8f1\nP\n\uf8f4\nT1 (x, y) = y + xy \u03c0\u2208T2 xn(\u03c0)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nk\u22122\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nPk\u22122\nT20 (x, y) = xy 2 (T1 (x, 1) + i=0\nT2i (x, 1))\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 T (x, y) = xy 2 T\n(x, 1), j = 1, 2, . . . , k \u2212 2\n.\n2j\n\n2j\u22121\n\nPk\u22122\nClearly, it is T k (x, y) = T1 (x, y) + j=0\nT2j (x, y) and, if y = 1, T k (x, 1)\nis the generating function of the permutations of S(123, 213, 1(k + 1)k . . . 2)\naccording to their length. From the above system (we omit the calculus), it\nfollows:\n1\u2212x\nT k (x, 1) =\n.\n1 \u2212 2x + xk+1\nNote that if k grows to \u221e, the generating function t(x) related to the sequence\n{2n\u22121 }n\u22650 (enumerating the permutations of S(123, 213), see Section 2) is\nobtained. For each k \u2265 2, we get an expression which is the generating\nfunction of the k-generalized Fibonacci numbers. For k = 1, the formula leads\n1\nto 1\u2212x\nwhich is the generating function of the sequence {1}n\u22650 enumerating\nthe permutations of Sn (123, 213, 12) = Sn (12) = n (n \u2212 1) . . . 2 1. For k = 3\nthe succession is\n\uf8f1\n(1)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n(1)\n(20 )\n(20 )\n(20 )(21 )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n(21 )\n(20 )(1) ,\n\nwhich defines the Tribonacci numbers, whose generatring function is T 3 (x, 1) =\n1\n.\n1\u2212x\u2212x2 \u2212x3\n\n8\n\n\f4\n\nFrom 2n\u22121 to Catalan\n\nLet \u03c0 be a permutation of Sn (123, k(k \u2212 1) . . . 21(k + 1)). Then if \u03c0i = n\nit is i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , k}, otherwise if \u03c0j = n with j \u2265 k + 1, it should be\n\u03c01 > \u03c02 > . . . > \u03c0k in order to avoid the pattern 123. But in this way the\nentries \u03c01 , \u03c02 , . . . , \u03c0k , \u03c0j are a pattern k(k \u22121) . . . 21(k +1) which is forbidden.\nIf \u03b1\u03c0 denotes the minimum index j such that \u03c0j\u22121 < \u03c0j , we can describe\nthe active sites of \u03c0 by using \u03b1\u03c0 .\n1. If \u03b1\u03c0 = j \u2264 k, then the active sites are the first j sites of \u03c0. The\ninsertion of n + 1 in any other site would create the pattern 123. In\nthis case \u03c0 as label (j).\n2. If \u03b1\u03c0 > k, then the active sites of \u03c0 are the first k sites since the\ninsertion of n + 1 in any other site would lead to the occurrence of the\nforbidden patterns k(k \u2212 1) . . . 21(k + 1) or 123. In this case \u03c0 has label\n(k).\nIn order to describe the labels of the sons of \u03c0, in the sequel we denote \u03c0\u0304 (i)\nthe permutation \u03c0\u0304 \u2208 Sn+1 (123, k(k \u2212 1) . . . 21(k + 1)) obtained from \u03c0 by\ninserting n + 1 in the i-th active site of \u03c0.\n1. If \u03c0 has label (k), it is not difficult to see that \u03b1\u03c0\u0304(1) = \u03b1\u03c0 + 1 > k, then\n\u03c0\u0304 (1) has label (k) again. While, if we consider \u03c0\u0304 (i) , with i = 2, 3, . . . , k,\nthen \u03b1\u03c0\u0304(i) = i and \u03c0\u0304 (i) has label (i). Therefore the production of the\nlabel (k) is (k)\n(2)(3) . . . (k)(k).\n2. If \u03c0\nthat\ncase\n\u03b1\u03c0\u0304(i)\n(j)\n\nhas label (j) with j \u2208 {2, 3, . . . , k \u2212 1}, then it is easily seen\n\u03b1\u03c0\u0304(1) = \u03b1\u03c0 + 1 \u2264 k and \u03c0\u0304 (1) has label (j + 1) (note that in this\n\u03b1\u03c0 = j). While if we consider \u03c0\u0304 (i) , with i = 2, 3, . . . , j, then\n= i and \u03c0\u0304 (i) has label (i). Therefore the production of (j) is\n(2)(3) . . . (j)(j + 1).\n\nThe above construction can be encoded by the succession rule:\n\uf8f1\n(1)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n(1)\n(2)\n(j)\n(2)(3) . . .

(k)(k)\n,\n9\n\n\fwhere the axiom and its production refer to the empty permutation generating the permutation \u03c0 = 1, which, in turn, produces two sons: \u03c0 = 12 and\n\u03c0 = 21. Using the theory developed in [DFR], the production matrix related\nto the above succession rule is\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 1 0 *** *** *** ***\n\uf8ec 0 1 1 0 *** *** *** \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0 1 1 1\n\uf8f7\n0\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\uf8ec . . . .\n\uf8f7\n..\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n.\nPk = \uf8ec .. .. .. ..\n\uf8f7 ,\n\uf8ec . . . .\n\uf8f7\n.\n\uf8ec .. .. .. ..\n\uf8f7\n..\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed 0 1 1 1\n1 *** 1 \uf8f8\n0 1 1 1\n1 *** 2\n\nwith k rows and columns. For each k \u2265 2, it is easy to see that the matrix\nPk can be obtained from Pk\u22121 as follows:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n0\nuT\n,\nPk =\n0 Pk\u22121 + euT\n\nwhere uT is the row vector (1, 0, . . . , 0) and e is the column vector (1, 1, . . . , 1)T\n(both k \u2212 1-dimensional). If fPk (x) is the generating function according to\nthe length of the permutations associated to Pk , from a result in [DFR] (more\nprecisely Proposition 3.10), the following functional equation holds:\nfPk (x) =\n\n1\n.\n1 \u2212 xfPk\u22121 (x)\n\nIn the limit, we have f (x) = 1\u2212xf1 (x) which is the functional equation\nverified by the generating function of the Catalan numbers C(x).\nAs a particular case, it is possible to check that for k = 3, the sequence of\nthe even index Fibonacci numbers is involved.

Since the class S(123, 132)\nis enumerated by {2n\u22121}n\u22650 , too, one can choose the pattern 213 instead of\n132 (among the forbidden patterns of the permutations of S(123, 213, 132))\nas the one to be generalized. Indeed, there is no a particular reason why we\nchose the pattern 132 to make it disappear.\nSimilarly, starting from S(123, 132) and recalling that |Sn (p)| = Cn \u2200 p \u2208\nS3 , either the pattern 123 or the pattern 132 can be generalized in order to\nfind a class enumerated by the Catalan numbers.\nThe difference between a choice with respect to another one lies in the fact\nthat different ECO construction for the permutations are expected. Therefore, different succession rules for the same sequence could be found.\n\n5.1\n\nFrom Fibonacci to 2n\u22121\n\nStarting from S(123, 213, 132), here we generalize the pattern 213 considering the class S(123, 132, k(k \u2212 1) . . . 21(k + 1)), for k \u2265 3. This class\nhas already been described in [E], where the author provides the structure\nof its permutations. From his results, it is possible to deduce the following\nsuccession rule (similarly to Section 3, the details are omitted), encoding the\nconstruction of those permutations:\n\uf8f1\n(1)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n(1)\n(2)\n(h)\n(1)h\u22121 (h + 1) for h < k\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n(k)\n(1)k\u22121 (k)\n\nIn [E] the author shows also that the k-generalized Fibonacci numbers are the\nenumerating sequence of the permutations of S(123, 132, k(k \u2212 1) . . . 21(k +\n1)). This fact can be derived also by solving the system that can be obtained\nfrom the above succession rule, with a technique similar to that one used in\n1\u2212x\nSection 3 leading to the same generating function T k (x, 1) = 1\u22122x+x\nk+1 . This\nagrees with the fact that in the limit for k \u2192 \u221e, the class to be considered\nis S(123, 132), enumerated by {2n\u22121 }n\u22650 [Si]. We note that it is possible to\n\n11\n\n\fdescribe the permutations of S(123, 132) with the succession rule\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 (1)\n(1)\n(2)\n\uf8f3\n(h)\n(1)h\u22121 (h + 1) ,\n\nfrom which one can get that the related generating function is, again, t(x) =\n1\u2212x\n.\n1\u22122x\nThe particular case k = 3 is marked: the obtained succession rule is\n\uf8f1\n(1)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n(1)\n(2)\n(2)\n(1)(3)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n(3)\n(1)(1)(3) .\n\ncorresponding to the sequence of Tribonacci numbers, as one can check by\nderiving the related generating function T 3 (x, 1) = 1\u2212x\u2212x1 2 \u2212x3 .\n\n5.2\n\nFrom 2n\u22121 to Catalan\n\nStarting from S(123, 132), the pattern 132 is generalized in (k \u2212 1)(k \u2212\n2) . . . 21(k + 1)k, with k \u2265 3. Moreover, the construction of the permutations\nof S(123, (k \u22121)(k \u22122) . . . 21(k + 1)k) is described and the corresponding succession rule is showed. Finally, we prove that the corresponding generating\nfunction is, in the limit for k \u2192 \u221e, the generating function of the Catalan\nnumbers C(x).\nLet \u03c0 be a permutation of Sn (123, (k \u2212 1)(k \u2212 2) . . . 21(k + 1)k). We\ndenote:\n\u2022 r = min{1, 2, . . . , n} such that \u03c0r\u22121 < \u03c0r ;\n\u2022 s = min{1, 2, . . . , n} and t = min{1, 2, . . . , n} such that, fore some\nindexes m1 < m2 < . . . < mk\u22122 < s < t, it is \u03c0m1 \u03c0m2 . . . \u03c0mk\u22122 \u03c0s \u03c0t \u2243\n(k \u2212 1)(k \u2212 2) . . . 21k (the two subsequences are order-isomorphic and\n\u03c0s and \u03c0t correspond to the 1 and to the k of the pattern (k \u2212 1)(k \u2212\n2) . . . 21k);\n\u2022 \u03b1\u03c0 = min{r, s};\n\u2022 \u03c0\u0304 (l) the permutation of Sn+1 (123, (k \u2212 1)(k \u2212 2) . . . 21(k + 1)k) obtained\nfrom \u03c0 by inserting n + 1 in the l-th site.\n12\n\n\fWe prove that \u03c0 has \u03b1\u03c0 active sites which are the first \u03b1\u03c0 sites of \u03c0.\nIt is easily seen that that the insertion of n + 1 in any site among the\nfirst \u03b1\u03c0 sites of \u03c0, does not induce either the pattern 123 or the pattern\n(k \u2212 1)(k \u2212 2) . . . 21(k + 1)k. On the other hand, if \u03b1\u03c0 = r, then the insertion\nof n + 1 in the l-th site, l > \u03b1\u03c0 , would create the pattern 123 in the entries\n(l)\n(l) (l)\n\u03c0\u0304r\u22121 \u03c0\u0304r \u03c0\u0304l .

In order to describe the labels of the\nsons \u03c0\u0304 (l) , l = 1, 2, . . . , h, of \u03c0, we have:\n1. If h < k (note that on this case \u03b1\u03c0 = r or, if \u03b1\u03c0 = s, then s = k \u2212 1),\nthen the permutation \u03c0\u0304 (1) = (n + 1)\u03c01 \u03c02 . . . \u03c0\u03b1\u03c0 . . . \u03c0k . . . \u03c0n , so that\n\u03b1\u03c0\u0304(1) = \u03b1\u03c0 + 1. Therefore \u03c0\u0304 (1) has label (h + 1). While if we consider\n(j)\n(j)\nthe permutations \u03c0\u0304 (j) , j = 2, 3, . . . , h, it is \u03b1\u03c0\u0304(j) = j since \u03c0\u0304j\u22121 < \u03c0\u0304j (=\nn + 1). So \u03c0\u0304 (j) has label (j) and we conclude that the production of\n(h) is (h)\n(2)(3) . . . (h)(h + 1).\n2. If h \u2265 k, then \u03c0\u0304 (1) = (n + 1)\u03c01 \u03c02 . . . \u03c0k . . . \u03c0\u03b1\u03c0 . . . \u03c0n , so that \u03b1\u03c0\u0304(1) =\n\u03b1\u03c0 + 1. Therefore \u03c0\u0304 (1) has label (h + 1). Note that in both cases\n\u03b1\u03c0 = r or \u03b1\u03c0 = s it is \u03c01 > \u03c02 > . . . > \u03c0\u03b1\u03c0 \u22121 . Then, if we consider\nthe permutations \u03c0\u0304 (j) , j = k, k + 1, . . . , \u03b1\u03c0 , we obtain \u03b1\u03c0\u0304(j) = k \u2212 1,\n(j) (j)\n(j)\n(j)\nregardless of j, since \u03c0\u03041 \u03c0\u03042 . . . \u03c0\u0304k\u22121 \u03c0\u0304j \u2243 (k \u2212 1)(k \u2212 2) . . . 1k. Then\n\u03c0\u0304 (j) has label (k \u2212 1), for j = k, k + 1, . . . , \u03b1\u03c0 . For the remaining sons\n(j)\n(j)\n\u03c0\u0304 (j) , j = 2, 3, . . . , k \u2212 1, it is easily seen that \u03c0\u0304j\u22121 < \u03c0\u0304j (= n + 1). So,\n\u03c0\u0304 (j) has label (j). We conclude that, in this second case, the production\nof (h) is (h)\n(2)(3) . . . (k \u2212 2)(k \u2212 1)h\u2212k+2(h + 1).\nThe above description of the generation of the permutations of S(123, (k \u2212\n1)(k \u2212 2) . . . 21(k + 1)k) can be then encoded in the following succession rule\n\u03a9k :\n\uf8f1\n(1)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n(1)\n(2)\n\u03a9k =\n(h)\n(2) * * * (h)(h + 1) for h < k\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n(h)\n(2) * * * (k \u2212 2)(k \u2212 1)h\u2212k+2(h + 1) for h \u2265 k\n.\n13\n\n\fFor k = 2, the class S(123, 132) is obtained, whose corresponding succession\nrule has been considered in Section 5.1. Note that it does not correspond\nwith the one obtained from the above one poising k = 2.\nFor k = 3 (the class is S(123, 2143)) we get the succession rule:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 (1)\n(1)\n(2)\n\uf8f3\n(h)\n(2)h\u22121 (h + 1) ,\n\nleading to the even index Fibonacci numbers. Note that it is different from\nthe succession rule corresponding to the same numbers of Section 4. Its\nassociated production matrix [DFR] is:\n0\n\nB\nB\nB\nM3 = B\nB\n@\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n..\n.\n\n1\n1\n2\n3\n..\n.\n\n0\n1\n0\n0\n..\n.\n\n0\n0\n1\n0\n..\n.\n\n0\n0\n0\n1\n..\n.\n\n***\n***\n***\n***\n..\n.\n\n1\n\nC\nC\nC\nC .\nC\nA\n\nFor each k \u2265 4, it is easy to check that the production matrix related to \u03a9k\nsatisfies\n\u0013\n\u0012\n0\nuT\n,\nMk =\n0 Mk\u22121 + euT\nwhere uT = (1, 0, 0, . . .) and e = (1, 1, 1, . . .)T . Then, if gMk (x) is the corresponding generating function, we deduce [DFR]:\ngMk (x) =\n\n1\n.\n1 \u2212 xgMk\u22121 (x)\n\n1\nIf g(x) denotes the limit of gMk (x), the functional equation g(x) = 1\u2212xg(x)\nis\nobtained, which is verified by the generating function C(x) of the Catalan\nnumbers.\n\n6\n\nFrom Fibonacci to Catalan directly\n\nThis section summarizes the results found when the two patterns 132 and\n213 are generalized at the same time, considering the class S(123, (k \u2212 1)(k \u2212\n2) . . . 21(k + 1)k), k(k \u2212 1) . . . 21(k + 1)) in order to obtain the class S(123),\nwhen k grows to \u221e. Most of the proofs are omitted but they can easily\n14\n\n\frecovered by the reader. At the first\nrule:\n\uf8f1\n(1)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n(1)\n(2)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n(3)\n\nstep, for k = 3, we find the succession\n(2)\n(2)(3)\n(2)(2)(3)\n\ncorresponding to Sn (123, 2143, 3214). This class is enumerated by Pell numbers which we define with the recurrence:\n\uf8f1\np0 = 1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\np1 = 1\np2 = 2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\npn = 2pn\u22121 + pn\u22122 , n \u2265 3\n\nNote that the initial conditions are different from the usual ones (which are\np0 = 0 and p1 = 1) in order to consider the empty permutation \u03b5, for n = 0.\nFor a general k we have the class Sn (123, (k \u2212 1) * * * 1(k + 1)k, k(k \u2212\n1) * * * 1(k + 1)). We briefly describe the construction of the permutations of\nthe class (the details are omitted). Let \u03c0 be a permutation of the class. It\nis easily seen that if \u03c0l = n, then l \u2264 k. Therefore, if (h) denotes the label\nof \u03c0, it is h \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , k}. Now, if h < k, then \u03c0\u0304 (1) has label (h + 1) and\n\u03c0\u0304 (j) , j = 2, 3, . . . , h, has label (j). While, if h = k, then \u03c0\u0304 (1) has label (k),\n\u03c0\u0304 (j) , j = 2, 3, . . . , k \u2212 1, has label (j) and \u03c0\u0304 (k) has label (k \u2212 1), again. The\nconstruction can be encoded in the succession rule:\n\uf8f1\n(1)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n(1)\n(2)\n(h)\n(2)(3) * * * (h \u2212 1)(h)(h + 1) h < k\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n(k)\n(2)(3) * * * (k \u2212 1)(k \u2212 1)(k) .\n\nFor each k, considering the associated production matrices [DFR] and the\ncorresponding generating functions, it possible to prove that, in the limit,\nthe generating function of the Catalan numbers is obtained.\n\n6.1\n\nA continuity between Pell numbers and even index\nFibonacci numbers\n\nWe conclude by showing that it is possible to find a \"continuity\" between Pell and even index Fibonacci numbers. We start from the class\n15\n\n\fSn (123, 2143, 3214) (obtained by posing k = 3 in the preceding succession\nrule) enumerated by Pell numbers, then we generalize the pattern 2143, so\nobtaining the classes S(123, 3214, 21(k + 1)k(k \u2212 1) . . . 43).\nLet \u03c0 \u2208 Sn (123, 3214, 21(k + 1)k(k \u2212 1) . . . 43). Then, if \u03c0l = n, it is l \u2264 3\nin order to avoid the patterns 123 and 3214. Therefore, \u03c0 has at most 3\nactive sites (the first three sites of \u03c0). We denote r\u03c0 the number of entries of\n\u03c0 with index j \u2265 3 such that \u03c0j > \u03c01 (note that if \u03c01 > \u03c02 , then r\u03c0 = 0). It\nis:\n\u2022 \u03c0j1 > \u03c0j2 > . . . > \u03c0jr\u03c0 (the pattern 123 is forbidden);\n\u2022 r\u03c0 \u2264 (k \u2212 2) (the pattern 21(k + 1)k . . . 43 is forbidden);\n\u2022 the elements \u03c0ji are adjacent in \u03c0 in order to avoid 123 or 21(k +\n1)k . . . 43.\nIf \u03c0 starts with an ascent (i.e. \u03c01 < \u03c02 ), then only the first two sites are\nactive, since the insertion of n + 1 in any other site would create the pattern\n123: the permutation \u03c0 has label (2).\nIf \u03c0 starts with a descent (i. e. \u03c01 > \u03c02 ), then the number of its active\nsites depends on r\u03c0 :\n1. If r\u03c0 = h < k \u2212 2, then \u03c0 has three active sites. Let (3h ) be its label.\nThe permutation \u03c0\u0304 (1) (obtained by \u03c0 by inserting n + 1 in the first site)\nstarts with a descent and r\u03c0\u0304(1) = 0 (since \u03c0\u0304 ( 1)1 = n + 1); therefore, \u03c0\u0304 (1)\nhas label (30 ). The son \u03c0\u0304 (2) starts with an ascent and its label is (2).\nThe last son \u03c0\u0304 (3) starts with a descent and r\u03c0\u0304(3) = h + 1, so its label is\n(3h+1). The production of (3h ) is (3h )\n(2)(30 )(3h+1).\n2. If r\u03c0 = k \u2212 2, then \u03c0 has two active sites, since the insertion in the\nthird site would create the pattern 21(k + 1)k . . . 43, while the insertion\nin any other site surely creates the pattern 123. Its son \u03c0\u0304 (1) has label\n(30 ) since it starts with a descent and r\u03c0(1) = 0. While the other son\n\u03c0\u0304 (2) starts with an ascent and has label (2). Therefore, the production\nof label (2) is (2)\n(2)(30 ).\nThe following succession rule:\n\uf8f1\n(1)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n(2)\n\uf8f2 (1)\n(2)\n(2)(30 )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n(3\n)\n(2)(30)(3j+1 ),\n\uf8f4\nj\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n(3k\u22123 )\n(2)(2)(30)\n\nfor j = 0, 1, 2, . . . , k \u2212 3\n16\n\n\fsummarizes the construction of the class S(123, 3214, 21(k +1)k . . . 43). Solving the system one can deduce from the above rule, the generating function\n1\u22122x+xk\nF\u0304k (x) = 1\u22123x+x\n2 +xk is obtained, which in the limit is the generating function\nof the even index Fibonacci numbers F\u0304 (x).\nStarting from the class S(123, 2143, 3214, ), one can generalize the pattern\n3214 instead of 2143. The class we get is S(123, 2143, k(k \u2212 1) . . . 32(k +\n1)1) and the succession rule describing its construction is (the easy proof is\nomitted):\n\uf8f1\n(1)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n(1)\n(2)\n(h)\n(2)h\u22121 (h + 1) for h < k\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n(k)\n(2)k\u22121(k) .\n\nOnce again, one can prove that the corresponding generating function is\nF\u0304k (x), leading, in the limit, to F\u0304 (x).\n\n7\n\nRemarks\n\nIn order to summarize the several \"continuities\" we have proposed in the\npaper, we condense our results in Figure 1 where a straight line represents\na direct step and a dashed line represents a family of permutations obtained\nby generalizing one or two patterns.\nThe results we found for permutations can be easily extended to Dyck\npaths and planar trees by means of ECO method [BDPP3, BDPP4]. We\ncan find classes of paths and trees described by the finite succession rules we\nintroduced by imposing some conditions on the height of paths and the level\nof their valleys and on the outdegree and level of nodes in the trees.\nFigure 1 allows to see the different three ways we have followed to describe a discrete \"continuity\" between Fibonacci and Catalan numbers: the\ngeneralization of a single pattern (the rightmost and the leftmost path from\nthe top to the bottom in the figure) and the generalization of a pair of patterns (central path in the figure). In particular, following the rightmost and\nthe leftmost path in the graph, the intermediate level of the permutations\nenumerated by {2n\u22121 }n\u22650 is encountered. For each k, our approach produces\ntwo different class of permutations enumerated by the same sequence, indeed\n17\n\n\f(123, 132, 213)\nFibonacci\n\n(123, 213)\n\n(123, 132)\n\nn -1\n\n2 n -1\n\n2\n\n(123,2143,3214)\nPell\n\n(123, 3214)\nEven index\nFibonacci\n\n(123, 2143)\nEven index\nFibonacci\n\n(123)\nCatalan\n\nFigure 1: The graph of permutations.\nthe two corresponding generating functions are the same for each k. We note\nthat, in this way, we can provide two different succession rules encoding the\nsame sequence. An instance can be seen by looking at the succession rules\nthe reader can find at the end of the Sections 3 and 5.1.\nThe same happens with the succession rule at the end of Section 5.2 and\nthe succession rule of the particular case (k = 3) of Section 5.2, which encode\nthe sequence of the even index Fibonacci numbers. Really, we did not prove\nthat this is the case for each k related to the classes of permutations used\nto describe the discrete continuity between {2n\u22121 }n\u22650 and Catalan numbers,\nsince we did not get the explicit formulas of the generating functions.\n\n18\n\n\fReferences\n[BK] J.
