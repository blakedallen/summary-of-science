Here we argue that, in terms of those\nplanetary systems which have been observed, the case for the solar system being a\ntypical planetary system has yet to be established. We consider the possibility that\nmost observed planetary systems have been formed in some quite different way. If so, it\nmay be that none of the observed planetary systems is likely to harbour an earth-like\nplanet.\nKey words: accretion, accretion discs - planetary systems: protoplanetary discs\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nUntil about ten years ago, theories of planetary formation\nconcentrated, of necessity, on the formation of planets in\nthe solar system (e.g. Lissauer 1993). The theories provide\na reasonable explanation, in terms extending back to the\nideas of Kant (1755) and others, of why the gas giants form\nat radii of more than around 5AU from the sun, of why the\nbasic building block of a planet is a rocky core, built up of\ndust via planetesimals in the solar nebula, and of why the\norbits of the planets are essentially coplanar and circular. In\nthe last ten years, over a hundred planetary systems have\nbeen discovered, and, at first glance, none of them resembles\nthe solar system (or what the solar system would appear to\nbe when seen from an appropriate distance). In comparing\nthe various systems, it seems sensible as a first step to just\nconsider the properties of the planet which has the largest\nvelocity semi-amplitude in each observed system. In Figure 1\nwe plot the observed eccentricity, e, against the semi-major\naxis, a, (measured in AU) for the planet with the largest\nvelocity semi-amplitude in each of the observed systems, including Jupiter as the representative for the solar system.\n(We discuss the sample used in our analysis in Section 2.2\nand we find no bias in the choice of this as our sample).\nIt is apparent from Fig. 1 that in the observed systems the\nplanets are much closer to the central star (indeed too close\nto the central star to have formed by the conventional theory \u2013 Lin, Bodenheimer & Richardson 1996; Bodenheimer,\nHubickyj & Lissauer 2000), and have in general, compared\nto the solar system, highly eccentric orbits (except for those\nclose enough to the central star that tidal circularization\n\nhas had time to act \u2013 Rasio et al. 1994). Looked at as a\ndistribution in the two-dimensional (a, e)-plane it is immediately apparent that the solar system does not lie within\nthe part of the (a, e)-plane defined by the currently observed\ndistribution of exo-planetary systems.\nThus the natural question arises of whether the solar\nsystem is special in some way compared to the majority\nof planetary systems to be found in the Galaxy (c.f. the\ndiscussion in Ford, Havlickova & Rasio 2001). Of course, we\nknow already that it is special in the sense that we are in it,\nand it is therefore no surprise that all the early models of\nthe formation of planetary systems applied entirely to the\nsolar system.1 But if the solar system is strongly atypical as\na planetary system, in the sense of lying at some extreme\nin the distribution of properties of all planetary systems,\nthen the more relevant question arises. To what extent we\nshould allow our understanding of the formation of planetary\nsystems, gleaned from observing one atypical and extreme\nexample, albeit at close-range, to bias our understanding of\nthe formation of planetary systems in general?\nIn Section 2 we quantify the extent to which the solar\nsystem may, on current evidence, be considered to be a typical member of the ensemble of planetary systems. We make\nuse of a technique derived in the study of robust statistical\nprocedures in order to determine whether or not to discard\nsome of the observations because they are inconsistent with\nthe rest of the observations and/or with the probability distribution assumed to be the underlying distribution of the\ndata. We show that the solar system is, formally, an outlier\n\n1\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: martin.beer@astro.le.ac.uk\n\nc 2004 RAS\n\nJust as almost all models in cosmology apply entirely to the\nUniverse.\n\n\f2\n\nM. E. Beer, A. R. King, M. Livio & J. E. Pringle\n2.1\n\nBox-Cox power transformation\n\nThe Box-Cox power transformation (Box & Cox 1964; see\nchapter 5 of Madansky 1988 for a detailed discussion) is used\nto transform a set of observed data points so that they are\nmore normally distributed. The Box-Cox transformation is\nof the form\ny\u03bb (x) =\n\n(\n\nx\u03bb \u2212 1\n\u03bb\nlog x\n\nif \u03bb 6= 0\n\n(1)\n\n\u03bb=0\n\nand y\u03bb (x) will have a normal distribution exactly only if\n\u03bb = 0 or 1/\u03bb is an even integer. The aim of the Box-Cox\ntransformation is to find the value of \u03bb which gives the best\napproximation to a normal distribution for the transformed\ndata. If y\u03bb (x) is normally distributed the maximum likelihood estimator of the mean of the transformed data is\n\u0233\u03bb =\n\nn\nX\ny\u03bbi\ni=1\n\nn\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nand the maximum likelihood estimator of the variance is\nFigure 1. A plot of eccentricity versus semi-major axis for the\nsample discussed in this paper. The diamond at the bottom right\nrepresents the solar system in the form of Jupiter.\n\ns2\u03bb =\n\nn\nX\n(y\u03bbi \u2212 \u0233\u03bb )2\ni=1\n\nn\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\nThe log likelihood function is\nn\n\nfrom the rest the distribution defined by the observed exoplanetary systems. In Section 3 we discuss possible reasons\nfor this result, and address the question of whether it is currently justified to allow the habitability of the solar system\nto influence our views on planet formation in general. We\nsummarise our conclusions in Section 4.\n\n2\n\nROBUST STATISTICS\n\nIn this Section we address the formal question of whether the\nsolar system, as represented by Jupiter, is an outlier from the\nobserved distribution of exo-planetary systems. The properties of the known extrasolar planets are distributed nonparametrically (i.e. there is no known underlying distribution for the data). Consequently we require a non-parametric\nstatistical method in order to identify any outliers which\nmay exist in the data. Once any outliers have been identified and removed, the remaining dataset may be described\nin a statistical sense, as robust. In order to identify outliers\nin a dataset, a standard procedure is to use a boxplot (see,\nfor example, Hoaglin, Mosteller & Tukey 1983; Madansky\n1988). However, in order to quantify the degree to which a\nparticular point is an outlier, the simple boxplot does not\nsuffice. In order to do this, one standard procedure is to\ntransform the data so that it appears more closely to resemble a normal distribution. One class of such transformations\nis the power transformation as described below. Since the\nsolar system (Jupiter) differs from the bulk of the observed\nsystems both in terms of large semi-major axis, a, and small\neccentricity, e, we apply our statistical considerations to the\nobserved distribution of periastron distance, ap = a(1 \u2212 e).\n\nX\nn\nn\nn\nl(\u03bb) = \u2212 log(2\u03c0) \u2212 \u2212 log s2\u03bb + (\u03bb \u2212 1)\nlog xi . (4)\n2\n2\n2\ni=1\n\nWe may vary \u03bb to find the value at which this is a maximum\nand then look for outliers in the transformed distribution.\n\n2.2\n\nPeriastron analysis\n\nWe perform the Box-Cox analysis on the periastron distribution of the known extrasolar planets. The data for this analysis was taken from the California and Carnegie planet search\ncatalogue (http://exoplanets.org/planet table.shtml)2 . In\nthis analysis we only consider companions from the extrasolar planet catalogue which have the largest velocity semiamplitude (i.e. were discovered first in most cases). We have\nalso performed our analysis using both the most massive\nextrasolar planets in each system and using all the known\nplanets but the significance of Jupiter as an outlier does not\nvary.\nFig. 2 shows the distribution of periastron distances of\nthe known extrasolar planets plus Jupiter. In Fig. 2 it is\nclear that Jupiter (with a periastron distance of just under\n5 AU) is an outlier but how significant an outlier is unclear\nas the underlying distribution is unknown.\nA Box-Cox transformation finds that \u03bb = 0.185 gives\nthe maximum for the log likelihood function (equation 4).\nFig. 3 shows the transformed data. We can see how well this\nresembles a normal distribution by measuring the skewness\n\n2\n\nThe parameters for HD 190360 (also known as Gl777A) which\nhad been claimed to be the extrasolar planetary system most\nresembling Jupiter have recently been updated (Naef et al. 2003)\nfrom those originally published (Udry, Queloz & Mayor 2003).\nThe semi-major axis has increased from 3.65 AU to 4.8 AU and\nthe eccentricity from 0.0 to 0.48.\nc 2004 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20136\n\n\fHow special is the Solar System?\n\nFigure 2. A histogram showing the periastron distribution of the\nextrasolar planets in our sample and Jupiter. The arrow indicates\nthe bin containing Jupiter.\n\nand kurtosis of the transformed data. The skewness is given\nby\nS=\n\nn\n\u0010\n\u0011\nX\n1 y\u03bbi \u2212 \u0233\u03bb 3\ni=1\n\nn\n\n\u03c3\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\nand the kurtosis by\nK = \u22123 +\n\nn\n\u0010\n\u0011\nX\n1 y\u03bbi \u2212 \u0233\u03bb 4\ni=1\n\nn\n\n\u03c3\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03c3 is the standard deviation of the distribution (see\nPress et al. 1996, p. 606). The transformed data has a skewness of \u22120.09 and a kurtosis of \u22121.07. For a normal distribution of n data points\np\np we would expect a skewness of\n6/n and a kurtosis of 24/n. Our dataset has 98 points\nso we would expect a skewness and kurtosis of up to 0.25\nand 0.49 respectively. Clearly the transformed data is not\nskewed but it does have a significant kurtosis. This is caused\nby the well-known spike near the lower end of the distribution, consisting of 'hot Jupiters' at small orbital radii (Udry\net al. 2003).\nThe mean and standard deviation of this transformed\ndata are \u22120.71 and 1.11 respectively. Jupiter is a significant\noutlier at the 2.31 \u03c3 level and is the only two sigma data\npoint in the entire distribution. Jupiter has a transformed\nperiastron measurement of 1.86 while the next largest is that\nof HD 72659 which has a transformed value of 1.35 i.e. it is\nhalf a sigma from its nearest neighbour. Note that the fact\nthat we have used the AU as our unit of measurement, does\nnot affect the outcome. For example, we have also applied\nthe Box-Cox transformation to the periastron distance measured in SI units and to the logarithm of the periastron distance and find that the result is the same in all cases with\nthe transformed data resembling that of Fig. 3 (although\nwith different values for \u03bb).\nc 2004 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20136\n\n3\n\nFigure 3. A histogram showing the periastron distribution of\nthe extrasolar planets in our sample and Jupiter after a Box-Cox\npower transformation has been applied as described in section 2.1.\nThe arrow indicates the bin containing Jupiter.\n\n3\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe have noted that the solar system is an outlier in the parameter space of known planetary systems. This is already\nevident from Fig. 1, and we have used a non-parametric statistical test to show that Jupiter lies at about 2.3 \u03c3 in the tail\nof the periastron distribution. Given this, it seems sensible\nto enquire whether the solar system is a typical planetary\nsystem in the sense that it actually belongs to the set of exoplanetary systems observed so far, or whether it might be\nintrinsically different, or special, in some way. In particular,\nwe address the question of the extent to which it is necessary\nto assume that all planetary systems formed in the same way\nas the solar system. The major issue here is whether theoretical models for the formation of exo-planetary systems\nshould just consider minor modifications of the current theory for the formation of the solar system, or whether some\nquite different ideas might need to be investigated.\n3.1\n\nSelection effects\n\nThe most obvious point to make is that the way in which\nthe solar system was discovered differs from the rest. Nevertheless, it can be argued that systems similar to the solar system are abundant, but have not yet been discovered\ndue to observational selection effects. This point is made\nby Lineweaver & Grether (2002, 2003) and by Tabachnik &\nTremaine (2002). These authors fit power-law distributions\nto the properties of extra-solar planets, and then extrapolate them to encompass the properties of the solar system to\nmake deductions about the total number of planetary systems likely to be present, as well as their properties. However, the act of fitting a power-law distribution makes the\nimplicit assumption that the properties of planetary systems are essentially scale-free, and the act of extrapolating\n\n\f4\n\nM. E. Beer, A. R. King, M. Livio & J. E. Pringle\n\nthe distribution to encompass the solar system (and beyond)\nmakes implicit assumptions about the general properties of\nplanetary systems. Lineweaver & Grether (2002) emphasise\nthat overcoming the selection effects is mainly a matter of\ntime. In other words, it may be that all that is required to\nfind systems like the solar system is to observe candidate\nsystems for timescales as long as Jupiter's orbit. This will\ntake another 5 to 10 years. Thus application of a test of the\nkind used above to the dataset some 5 to 10 years from now\nwill demonstrate the credibility of this potential solution.\n\n3.2\n\nDichotomy\n\nThere is, however, already some evidence that the formation\nof planetary systems is not a scale-free process.

(2004a) find that there is a dichotomy between those systems which are observed to contain giant planets (at radii\ntypically a few AU or less) and those systems which have a\ndebris disc as evidenced by submillimetre emission at radii\ntypically in the range 20 \u2013 100 AU. They find that those\nsystems with observed giant planets show no evidence for a\ndebris disc, whereas, those systems which display evidence\nfor a debris disc are not directly observed to harbour giant\nplanets. However, as Greaves et al. (2004a) point out, there\nis evidence that these latter systems contain (currently unobserved) planets at larger radii. This evidence is in two\nforms. First, the absence of a mid-infrared excess in the debris disc systems points to the presence of planets orbiting\nat larger radii, which are able to clear a central cavity in\nthe dust distribution, and second, the suggestion of planets\nat larger radii is given credence by the evidence of internal\nstructure seen in those debris discs which can be imaged,\nsuch as clumping, gaps and warping (Greaves et al. 1998;\nJayawardhana et al. 1998; Weinberger et al. 1999; Wyatt et\nal. 1999; Lagrange, Backman & Artymowicz 2000; Augereau\net al. 2001; Holland et al. 2003; Wyatt 2003; Kalas, Liu &\nMatthews 2004). Meyer et al. (2004) recently demonstrated\nthe power of the Spitzer Space Telescope at investigating the\nproperties of debris discs. They note that it is already clear\nthat the interpretation of such discs is likely to be complicated and to involve a number of factors including perhaps\na range in primordial disc properties and/or evolutionary\nhistories.\n\n3.3\n\nTheoretical models\n\nWe therefore consider the implications of this observed break\nin scale. It might for example be an indication that there\nare two quite separate mechanisms of planet formation, or\nit might simply indicate that we are looking at two extremes\nof a single formation process.\nThe majority of the current thought (and literature)\non the formation of planetary systems (actually giant planets) makes use of the formation model derived for the solar\nsystem, modified in some manner. This standard model for\nthe solar system (Wetherill 1980; Mizuno 1980; Stevenson\n1982) assumes that planets form initially through the agglomeration of dust into grains, pebbles, rocks and thence\nplanetesimals within a gaseous disc, that these planetesimals\ncoalesce to form planetary cores, and that finally (for the giant planets) these cores use gravity to accrete gas from the\n\never-present disc. Most of the current theoretical research\neffort on exo-planets involves devising and justifying suitable modifications of this model, taking the overall view\nthat all planetary systems form a continuous distribution\nin some suitable parameter space. Even for the solar system, however, this scenario is not without problems (Lissauer 1993; Wuchterl, Guillot & Lissauer 2000). Most notably, the formation of planetesimals from small-scale dust,\nand the timescales required to accrete the gas onto the protoplanetary cores, encounter difficulties, given possible rapid\nmigration of the cores (Ward & Hahn 2000) and the required\ncore masses for runaway accretion, compared to those observed (see also the discussion by Boss 2000). The main modifications required to make the standard model fit the observed systems, involving planetary migration (e.g. Trilling,\nLunine & Benz 2002; Armitage et al. 2002; Alibert, Mordasini & Benz 2004) and the generation of orbital eccentricities (e.g. Rasio & Ford 1996), have difficulties which are\nnot yet fully resolved (see, for example, the discussions by\nMarcy et al. 1999; Udry, Mayor & Santos 2003; Tremaine &\nZakamska 2004).\nThe main alternative scenario involves the formation\nof giant planets directly, through gravitational instability in\nthe protostellar gaseous disc (Boss 2001; Rice et al. 2003;\nMayer et al. 2002; 2004). Although this model has problems fitting the solar system (for example, the presence of\nrocky cores in the giant solar system planets, not to mention\nthe existence of terrestrial planets, is more simply explained\nthrough the prior formation of the cores from rocky planetesimals), there is no fundamental reason why it, or some\nmodification of it, should not apply to the rest \u2013 that is,\nto the majority of the systems discovered so far. The major\nproblem with the model, as currently constructed, is that,\nin order to drive strong gravitational instability, it requires\na sudden change in disc properties on a timescale comparable to, or less than, the dynamical timescale. This is usually\nachieved in the simulations by setting the initial conditions\nappropriately. In reality, this might be achieved either via a\nsudden change in the cooling rate (e.g. Johnson and Gammie\n2003) and/or by a sudden change in the disc density brought\nabout by a dynamical interaction with a low-mass interloper. Note that the mass of such an interloper need only\nbe comparable to the mass of the proto-planetary disc (for\nexample a massive planet or a brown dwarf), and that such\ncollisions might be frequent in the crowded and chaotic conditions in which most stars form (Bate, Bonnell & Bromm\n2002a, 2002b, 2003).3 Black (1997) has noted that the similarity in eccentricity distributions between exo-planets and\nclose binary stars which might indicate that both sets of\nformation processes are dynamical in origin. There is indeed evidence that planetary properties depend on stellar\nmultiplicity (Zucker & Mazeh 2002; Eggenberger, Udry &\nMayor 2003). And such a dynamical mechanism for forming\nplanets is likely to give rise to a wide spread in eccentricities\nand should be able to give rise to planets at a wide range\nof orbital radii (Papaloizou & Terquem 2001; Terquem &\nPapaloizou 2002).\nIn light of the above discussion, it is possible to take\n\n3 Such ideas have resonance in the original ideas of Jeans (1928),\nstill being explored, for example, by Oxley & Woolfson (2004).\n\nc 2004 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20136\n\n\fHow special is the Solar System?\nthe view that there are two distinct formation mechanisms\nfor the formation of planets. First, there is the well-trodden\npath for the formation of the solar system, which produces\nrocky cores for gaseous planets at radii of several AU as\nwell as terrestrial planets at smaller radii, perhaps on essentially circular orbits. This mechanism would also be able to\nproduce the debris discs at several tens to hundreds of AU.\nSecond, there is the possibility of a more dynamical mechanism for planetary formation, using gravity directly in the\nformation process. Such a mechanism might be able to produce gaseous planets at a large range of radii, including the\nobserved giant planets at radii less than a few AU, and with\na spread of orbital eccentricities. But this mechanism would\nhave difficulty in producing terrestrial-type planets and debris discs. If this mechanism predominates among the observed planetary systems, then few, if any, of the planetary\nsystems detected so far would harbour earth-like rocky planets.\nThese arguments are reinforced by the following point.\nMost planetary systems have non-negligible eccentricities,\nand there is a growing body of opinion that habitability is\nnot very sensitive to orbital eccentricity (Williams & Pollard 2002, 2003; Jones 2003; Jones & Sleep 2003; Asghari\net al. 2004). So why, if the solar system is not special, do\nits planets have essentially circular orbits? One explanation\nfor this might be that terrestrial planets must form through\nsteady core growth in a disc, and such a planet formation\nmechanism tends to produce circular orbits.\nA further piece of evidence that requires explanation\nis the observation that there appears to be a correlation\nbetween the metallicity of a star and the probability of it\nharbouring a planetary system (Gonzalez, 1998; Gonzalez,\nWallerstein & Saar 1999; Reid 2002; Santos et al. 2003; Fischer & Valenti 2003). Fischer & Valenti (2003, and private\ncommunication) find that the probability of a star harbouring a planet rises from about 5 per cent when the iron abundance is \u223c 1/3 that of the sun, to about 20 per cent when\nthe iron abundance is \u223c 3 times that of the sun.\nIt could be argued (see, for example, Santos et al. 2003)\nthat this observed correlation can be taken as prima facie support for a model of planet formation which requires\nthe formation of rocky planetary cores as a pre-requisite for\nforming the gas giants which we observe. The correlation\nmight be an indication that the formation process is a continuous function of metallicity. In this picture, the metal-rich\nsystems would form planetary cores (and hence gas giants)\nin abundance while there is still enough gas in the disc to\ncause significant migration, somehow disposing of any excess cores so that there is no debris left. The less metal-rich\nsystems (including the solar system) would be able to form\na few cores which barely migrate just as the gas is expelled,\nleaving a few gas giants at around \u223c10 AU and a debris disc\nat larger radii.4\nIn contrast to this rocky-core formation model, formation through dynamical instability of a disc could lead to\n\n5\n\nthe observed giant planets in small and eccentric orbits.\nGreaves et al. (2004a) find that these systems do not show\ndebris discs. In addition, they find that systems with observed debris discs have suspected gas giants in large orbits\n(tens of AU). Although systems like the solar system may require some metallicity, this demonstrates the observed exoplanetary systems tend to be favoured by an even higher\ndegree of metallicity even though this is not a requirement\nof the disk instability model. Indeed, Santos, Israelian &\nMayor (2001) note that the 'Sun occupies a modest position\nin the low [Fe/H] tail of the metallicity distribution of stars\nwith planets' and go on to suggest that the lack of solar\nsystem analogues found so far leads one 'to speculate about\npossible different formation histories'.\nFrom a theoretical point of view, there are many reasons, other than core formation, as to why the formation of\ncurrently observable planetary systems might be dependent\non metallicity. For example, cooling processes in the disc at\nlow temperatures depend mainly on metals (e.g. Johnson &\nGammie 2003), as does the shielding of the disc from the Xray flux generated in the stellar corona/chromosphere (e.g.\nAlexander, Clarke & Pringle 2004), as well as the cooling\nrate in the region of the disc subject to evaporation (Hollenbach et al 1994). Thus, although metal abundance appears\nto play only a small r\u00f4le in the disc timescale for viscous evolution (Livio & Pringle 2004), it may play a significant r\u00f4le\nin the disc dynamics and/or in the timescale on which the\ndisc is dispersed by the central star. In addition, the extra\ncooling brought about by enhanced metal abundance might\nmean that the process of star formation takes place in denser\nenvironments in more metal-rich systems, perhaps increasing brown dwarf production, and in any case, enhancing the\nlikelihood of close interactions.\n\n4\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThere are two main formation scenarios envisaged for planet\nformation. The model applied to the solar system assumes\nthat planets form initially through the agglomeration of dust\ninto rocks and planetary cores, and that finally (for the giant\nplanets) these cores use gravity to accrete gas. Alternatively,\nthere is the possibility of a more dynamical mechanism using gravity directly in the formation process. The solar system model may not be applicable to the observed extrasolar\nplanets and the dynamical instability model has difficulty\nreproducing the solar system and debris discs. The metallicity dependence of both models needs to be investigated\nfurther.\nWe conclude that it is still possible that our current understanding of planetary systems is unduly coloured by our\nintimate knowledge of our own solar system. More observational work is needed if the solar system is to be shown to\nbe a 'normal' planetary system. And more theoretical work\nis required if alternative planet formation scenarios are to\nshown to be equally viable.\n\n4\n\nWe include the solar system in this category, although we note\nthat its debris disc of around 10\u22125 M\u2295 is somewhat smaller\nthan for example the debris disc of 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 M\u2295 found around\nthe nearby sun-like (both in age and spectral type) star \u03c4 Ceti\n(Greaves et al. 2004b).\nc 2004 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20136\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nJEP thanks STScI for hospitality and support from the Visitors' Program.
