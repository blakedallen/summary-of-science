The result turns out to be not too different from the continuum QCD spectrum. This has been the subject of numerous\nworks [2, 3, 4, 5]. To the best of our knowledge however, these analytic results\ninvolving different approximation schemes have never been compared with the results of numerical simulations in the infinite coupling limit (\u03b2 \u2261 6/g 2 = 0). Here,\nwe perform such a comparison for the case of 4 flavors of staggered fermions with\nSU(3) gauge group.\nIn addition, we are motivated by a puzzle in the phase diagram of QCD as a\nfunction of temperature T and chemical potential \u03bc. This phase diagram also can\nbe determined analytically when \u03b2 = 0, and has been investigated by use of increasingly sophisticated approximations over the years [6]-[11]. At zero temperature, a\nfirst-order transition is predicted to take place, where the baryon density jumps\nfrom zero to saturation (1 baryon per lattice site). The corresponding critical\nquark chemical potential for massless quarks has been calculated in the mean-field\napproximation, which yields \u03bcc a \u223c 0.66 [6]. This analytic prediction has also been\nconfirmed by numerical simulation of a gas of loops, the monomer-dimer-polymer\nensemble, whose partition function is identical to that of lattice QCD with staggered fermions at \u03b2 = 0 [12], and by the Glasgow reweighting method [13]. The\nnumerical simulation of [12] gives \u03bcc a = 0.63(2) in the chiral limit and 0.690(15)\nat mq a = 0.1. The result from [13] is \u03bcc a = 0.687(15) at mq a = 0.1. At first sight,\nthis excellent agreement between mean-field and Monte Carlo is very satisfying.\nOn second thought, however, it is rather mysterious. One would expect the transition to occur when (3\u03bc) exceeds the free energy required to create an additional\nbaryon, which is equal to its mass at T = 0. Now, every analytic prediction for\nthe nucleon mass mN gives a value (mN a) very close to 3 so that (\u03bcc a) should be\nvery close to 1. The values reported above are considerably smaller. Among the\nvarious explanations for this puzzle, we want to check the validity of the analytic\napproximations: is the nucleon mass really close to 3 in the strong coupling limit,\nor is it close to 3\u03bcc a instead?\nIn the next section (Sec.II), we review the analytic approximations which have\nbeen proposed for the hadron spectrum. Then (Sec.III) we present our simulation\nresults and compare our numerical results to the analytic predictions in Table I.\nConclusions follow.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nOverview of analytic approaches\n\nIn the strong coupling limit, the gauge field part of the action can be dropped\nbecause its coefficient is \u03b2 = 0, and the gauge link variables become random SU(N)\ngroup elements. Then, gauge links give non-vanishing contributions only when a\ngiven link forms a part of an SU(N) singlet combination. Using this property,\none can construct either an effective action and derive the hadron spectrum from\nit [2, 3], or one can count the graphically relevant diagrams and obtain from them\nthe hadron spectrum [4].\nIn [2, 3], the authors derive the effective action for SU(3) in terms of meson and\nbaryon degrees of freedom by integrating the gauge link variables out. Then, via\nsystematic large-d (the spacetime dimension) expansion of this effective action, the\nchiral condensate and the correlation functions of the composite mesonic and baryonic fields are obtained. The positions of poles in the zero momentum projected\ncorrelators give meson (MM ) and baryon (MB ) masses which can be summarized\nas follows:\n1\nh\u03c8\u03c8i \u2248\nN\n\ns\n\n2\n(\u03bb \u2212 2m)\nd\n\n(1)\n\n2\n\ncosh MM a = d(\u03bb \u2212 1) + 2k + 1,\n(2)\nN\n1 N\nsinh MB a =\n\u03bb (2d) 2\n(3)\n2\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwhere \u03bb = m + m2 + 1, m = ma/ 2d, ma is the dimensionless quark mass,\nand k = 0, 1, 2, 3 gives access to four meson channels, to which are assigned\nthe\n\u221a\nphysical meaning of the \u03c0, \u03c1, a1 , a0 /f0 respectively.

Leading corrections in 1/g 2\nwere also obtained in Ref. [5]. They always come in the combination 1/(g 2N).\n3\n\n\fPerhaps this motivated the authors of [4] to try a different approach. They\ndeveloped a graphical method for summing relevant, tree-like diagrams in the\nlarge-N limit (g 2N \u2192 \u221e) at fixed d. They showed\n1\ndmr \u2212 (2d \u2212 1)ma\nh\u03c8\u03c8i =\nN\nd2 + (ma)2\n((2d \u2212 1) \u2212 (2d \u2212 2)mr 2 + mr 4 )\n+ 2k,\ncosh MM a =\n2mr 2\n1 N\nsinh MB a =\nmr\n2\n\n(13)\n(14)\n(15)\n\nq\n\nwhere mr = ma + (ma)2 + 2d \u2212 1 and k = 0, 1, 2, 3. Again, for small ma \u226a\n\u221a\n2d \u2212 1, one obtains\n(M\u03c0 a)2\nM\u03c1 a\nMa1 a\nMa0 /f0 a\nMB a\n\n\u2248\n\u2248\n\u2248\n\u2248\n\u2248\n\n4.54ma\n1.76 + 0.81ma\n2.63 + 0.32ma\n2.29 + 0.46ma\n2.91 + 1.14ma\n\n(16)\n(17)\n(18)\n(19)\n(20)\n\nThe three sets of predictions are collected in Table I below, where they are\ndenoted respectively \"M.F.\"(mean field) [2, 3], \"1/d-corr.\" [5] and \"d = 4, largeN\" [4].

The 4-flavor theory can be simulated with standard Hybrid Monte Carlo. Nevertheless,\nwe used\nq\nRHMC [15], with two sets of pseudo-fermion fields each yielding det(M) after\nintegration. This decomposition allowed us to use a larger stepsize [16]. More\nimportantly, the stopping criterion of our solver was set to the very loose value\n1.0 \u00d7 10\u22122 , while maintaining an acceptance \u223c 65%. This great advantage of\nRHMC, recognized in [16], provides an important gain in efficiency.\nOur spatial volume is reasonably large compared to the pion mass (m\u03c0 L = 2.6\u2013\n5.3), and is very large compared to the nucleon mass (L \u223c 5.5 fm). Thus we expect\nnegligible finite-size effects on all observables except perhaps the pion mass, and\nanalytic predictions obtained on an infinite lattice [2, 3, 4, 5] can be directly\ncompared with our numerical results.

Note, however, that mN /m\u03c1 is about 1.6, close to the nonrelativistic value 3/2, and hardly changes with the quark mass. So the spectrum\nof strong coupling QCD is only crudely similar to that of continuum QCD.\nOur results are collected in the rightmost two columns of Table I, for the\nquenched (Nf = 0) and the full (Nf = 4) theory. Ref. [4] counts all quark \"tree\ngraphs\" which enclose zero area and is very similar to the quenched approximation.\nThis motivated us to include quenched simulation results for comparison. Indeed,\nthe tree graph resummation provides an excellent approximation to the quenched\nresults3 . Differences (of about 2%) are visible in the nucleon mass only. In turn,\n3\n\nCompared to the quenched theory, mesonic tree graphs do not include the contribution of\nbaryon loops, but these are suppressed by the heavy baryon mass.

Some channels are horizontally shifted to avoid\noverlapping data points.\n\nthe quenched and full QCD results are very close to each other, with the most\ndifference (at the 5% level) in the a0 /f0 channel.\nThe agreement between the full QCD results and the mean-field calculations [2,\n3] is reasonable, and improves with 1/d corrections [5]. It is best in general with\nthe large-N approach of [4].\nTo illustrate the level of agreement with the predictions of [4], we show in Fig. 1\nthe masses we measured together with the analytic dependence of [4] as a function\nof the quark mass. In Fig. 2, we show the ratio of our measured values over those\npredicted by [4]. The agreement is better than within 1% for the chiral condensate\ninclude the contribution of meson loops, which is probably the reason why the nucleon mass\nprediction is slightly wrong.\n\n7\n\n\f2.0\n\nBARE QUARK MASS (ma)\n\n1.5\n\nmu_c full model (Ref. 13)\nmonomer-dimer (Ref. 12)\nm_baryon/3 (our data)\nm_baryon/3 (mean-field)\npredicted mu_c (mean-field)\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\n1.4\nCHEMICAL POTENTIAL\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2.0\n\nFigure 3: mbaryon a/3 as a function of the quark mass mq a together with \u03bcc a (our\ndata is added to the Figure from Ref.

For\nthe nucleon, the Monte Carlo data is within 5% of [4]. Our determination of the\nscalar mass (a0 /f0 ) is too poor to provide a real check. Interestingly, the lattice\nresult agrees with the analytic result m\u03c0 < m\u03c1 < ma1 < ma0 /f0 , in contrast to the\nexperimental ordering, m\u03c0 < m\u03c1 < ma0 /f0 < ma1 .\nIn Figure 3, we compare our nucleon mass with old Monte Carlo data for the\ncritical, zero temperature quark chemical potential in infinite coupling QCD [12,\n13]. The error bar for 1/3 of our nucleon mass is smaller than the plot symbol.\nThere is a clear, large difference between the critical quark chemical potential and\n1/3 of the nucleon mass.\n\n8\n\n\f4\n\nConclusions\n\nOn the whole, our study justifies the mean-field approximation used in [2, 3]. It\nalso provides a beautiful confirmation of the approach of [4], which goes beyond\nmean-field and becomes exact when g 2N \u2192 \u221e. It may seem strange in fact that\nthis g 2N \u2192 \u221e approximation is so good (at the percent level), since virtual quark\nloops are absent in this approximation in contrast to the numerical simulation. The\nexplanation, we believe, lies in the small plaquette average value. The dynamical\nquarks shift the plaquette away from the value zero which it would take in the\nquenched case, but only slightly. This shift increases very mildly for lighter quarks.\nThe lightest quarks which we considered, mq a = 0.025, give a pion to rho mass\nratio near the physical one, but yield a plaquette value of 0.00682(3) only. This is\nmuch less than the naive estimate based on a 1/(mq a) expansion [21], which would\npredict an effective shift \u2206\u03b2 \u2248 0.8 in the gauge action, leading to a plaquette value\nO(0.1), about 15 times larger than measured. Thus, the price to pay for creating\nvirtual quark loops remains high, and their effect on the spectrum is small. For\nthe same reason, the quenched approximation turns out to be closer to full QCD\nat strong coupling than at weak coupling: at strong coupling, the ordering effect\nof the fermion loops is \"drowned\" in the disorder of the gluons.\nAs shown in Table I, the nucleon mass is just a bit smaller than 3. In particular,\nfor mq a = 0.1 which is the quark mass used in the finite density simulations\nof [12, 13], the nucleon mass is 2.931(3) and one would expect the T = 0 transition\ninduced by a quark chemical potential to occur at \u03bcc = 2.931(3)/3 = 0.977(1).\nHowever, the measured value for \u03bcc [12] is 0.690(15) (0.687(15) in [13]). The\ndiscrepancy with the expected value is about 30%. In other words, the nucleon\nseems to have a free energy about 300 MeV less than its mass. Could this be caused\nby a strong attraction among nucleons [17, 18]? The weakness of the real-world\nnuclear interaction results from near-cancellation between the attractive omega\nexchange and the repulsive sigma exchange [19]. This cancellation may not occur\nwhen the parameters of QCD are modified. Of course, other, less extraordinary\ncauses may be at work: non-zero temperature corrections, or even algorithmic\nproblems as suggested in [20]. This line of investigation should be pursued further.\n\n5\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nWe thank Olivier Martin for correspondence.
