It supplied a way to produce Planck scale black\nholes, and it gave useful clues to the discussion of issues\nlike the statistical properties of black holes, the black\nhole information paradox, and the analysis of topology\nchanging processes.\nIn order to turn the pair of virtual black holes real one\nneeds a background field that provides the energy needed\nto materialize the pair, and that furnishes the force necessary to accelerate away the black holes once they are\ncreated. This background field can be: (i) an external\nelectromagnetic field with its Lorentz force (see [1]-[10]),\n(ii) the positive cosmological constant \u039b, or inflation (see\n[11]-[17]), (iii) a cosmic string with its tension (see [18][22]), (iv) a domain wall with its gravitational repulsive\nenergy (see [23]-[26]). One can also have a combination\nof the above fields, for example, a process involving cosmic string breaking in a background magnetic field [27],\nor a scenario in which a cosmic string breaks in a positive\ncosmological background [28].\nThe evaluation of the black hole pair creation rate has\nbeen done at the semiclassical level using the instanton\nmethod. An instanton is an Euclidean solution that interpolates between the initial and final states of a classically forbidden transition, and is a saddle point for the\nEuclidean path integral that describes the pair creation\nrate. The instantons that mediate the above processes\ncan be obtained by analytically continuing (i) the Ernst\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: oscar@fisica.ist.utl.pt\n\nsolution [29] (which is available only for \u039b = 0), (ii) the\nde Sitter black hole solutions, (iii) the C-metric with a\ngeneralized cosmological constant \u039b [30, 31], or (iv) the\ndomain wall solution [32]. All these exact solutions describe appropriately the evolution of the black hole pair\nthat has been created, since they represent a pair of black\nholes accelerated by an electromagnetic field, by a cosmological constant, by a string, or by a domain wall,\nrespectively.\nAn important process that accompanies the production of the black hole pair is the emission of electromagnetic and gravitational radiation. In a flat background,\nan estimate for the amount of gravitational radiation released during the pair creation period has been given in\n[33]. After the pair creation, the black hole pair accelerates away and, consequently, the black holes continue\nto release gravitational and electromagnetic energy. In a\n\u039b = 0 background, the gravitational radiation emitted by\nuniformly accelerated black holes has been computed in\n[34], while in a dS background this analysis has been carried in [35], and in an AdS background the programme\nhas been completed in [36]. We ask the reader to see,\ne.g., the introduction of [28] for a recent and detailed description of the works done on black hole pair creation\nprocesses.\nIn this paper we want to analyze the process in which a\ncosmic string breaks and a pair of black holes is produced\nat the ends of the string, in an anti-de Sitter (AdS) background (\u039b < 0). Therefore, the energy to materialize and\naccelerate the pair comes from the strings tension. In an\nAdS background this is the only study done in the process of production of a pair of correlated black holes with\nspherical topology. The analysis of this process in a flat\nbackground (\u039b = 0) has been done in [18], while in a de\nSitter background (\u039b > 0) it has been carried in [28, 37]).\n\n\f2\nThe instantons for this process can be constructed by analytically continuing the AdS C-metric found in [31] and\nanalyzed in detail in [38, 39]. Contrary to the \u039b = 0 [30]\nand \u039b > 0 [37] cases, the AdS describes a pair of accelerated black holes only whenpthe acceleration supplied by\nthe strings is greater than |\u039b|/3 [38]. Hence we expect\nthat pair creation of black p\nholes in an AdS background\nis possible only when A > |\u039b|/3. We will confirm this\nexpectation. The quantum production of uncorrelated\nAdS black holes has been studied in [40], and the pair\ncreation process of topological AdS black holes (with hyperbolic topology) has been analyzed in [25] in a domain\nwall background.\nThe plan of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II we\nconstruct, from the AdS C-metric, the instantons that\ndescribe the pair creation process. In Sec. III, we explicitly evaluate the pair creation rate of black holes in\nan AdS background when a string breaks. In Sec. IV\nconcluding remarks are presented. In the Appendix A,\nwe discuss, for the benefit of comparison with the \u039b = 0\ncase, the pair creation of black holes in a \u039b = 0 background. We explicitly compute the numerical value of\nthe pair creation rate, which has not been done yet. In\nthe Appendix B a heuristic derivation of the pair creation rates is given.

The allowed range of x is\nbetween xs and xn where G(x) is positive and compact. In the\nLorentzian sector, the permitted range of y is \u2212x \u2264 y < +\u221e.\nThe presence of an accelerated horizon is indicated by yA and\n\u2032\nyA\nand the inner and outer charged horizons by y\u2212 and y+ .\nIn the extreme case y\u2212 and y+ coincide, and G(x) has only\ntwo real roots represented by xs and xn . When m = 0 and\nq = 0, both G(x) and F(y) are represented by a parabola with\nthe only zeros of G(x) being xs and xn , and the only zeros of\n\u2032\nF(x) being yA\nand yA .\n\nwhile in the electric case it is given by\nII.\n\nTHE AdS C-METRIC INSTANTONS\n\nThe AdS C-metric has been found in [31]. The physical\nproperties and interpretation ofp\nthis solution have been\nanalyzed in [38, 39]. When A > |\u039b|/3, and only in this\ncase [38], the AdS C-metric describes a pair of uniformly\naccelerated black holes in an AdS background, with the\nacceleration being provided by two strings, from each one\nof the black holes towards infinity, that pulls them away.\nSince we are interested in black hole p\npair creation, hereafter we will deal only with the A > |\u039b|/3 case. For a\ndetailed discussion on the properties of the AdS C-metric\nwe ask the reader to see [38]. Here we will only mention\nthose which are really essential.\nThe gravitational field of the Lorentzian AdS C-metric\nis given by (see, e.g., [38])\nds2 = [A(x + y)]\u22122 (\u2212F dt2 + F \u22121 dy 2 + G \u22121 dx2 + Gd\u03c62 ) ,\n(1)\nwith\n3A2 \u2212 |\u039b|\n+ y 2 \u2212 2mAy 3 + q 2 A2 y 4 ,\n3A2\nG(x) = 1 \u2212 x2 \u2212 2mAx3 \u2212 q 2 A2 x4 ,\n(2)\n\nF (y) = \u2212\n\nwhere \u039b < 0 is the cosmological constant, A > 0 is the\nacceleration of the black holes, and m and q are the ADM\nmass and electromagnetic charge of the non-accelerated\nblack hole, respectively. The Maxwell field in the magnetic case is given by\nFmag = \u2212q dx \u2227 d\u03c6 ,\n\n(3)\n\nFel = \u2212q dt \u2227 dy .\n\n(4)\n\nThe general shape of G(x) and F (y) is represented in Fig.\n1.\nThe solution has a curvature singularity at y = +\u221e\nwhere the matter source is. The point y = \u2212x corresponds to a point that is infinitely far away from the curvature singularity, thus as y increases we approach the\ncurvature singularity and y + x is the inverse of a radial\ncoordinate. At most, F (y) can have four real zeros which\nwe label in ascending order by yneg < 0 < yA \u2264 y+ \u2264 y\u2212 .\nThe roots y\u2212 and y+ are respectively the inner and outer\ncharged black hole horizons, and yA is an acceleration\nhorizon. The negative root yneg satisfies yneg < \u2212x and\nthus has no physical significance. The angular coordinate x belongs to the range [xs , xn ] for which G(x) \u2265 0\n(when we set A = 0 we have xs = \u22121 and xn = +1]). In\norder to avoid a conical singularity in the north pole, the\nperiod of \u03c6 must be given by\n\u2206\u03c6 =\n\n4\u03c0\n,\n|G \u2032 (xn )|\n\n(5)\n\nand this leaves a conical singularity in the south pole\nwith deficit angle\n\u0012\n\u0013\nG \u2032 (xs )\n\u03b4 = 2\u03c0 1 \u2212 \u2032\n.\n(6)\n|G (xn )|\nthat signals the presence of strings from each one of\nthe black holes towards infinity with mass density \u03bc =\n\n\f3\n\u03b4/(8\u03c0), and with pressure p = \u2212\u03bc < 0. When we set the\nacceleration parameter A equal to zero, the AdS C-metric\nreduces to the usual AdS\u2212Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m or AdSSchwarzschild solutions without conical singularities.\nLater on it will be crucial to note that the number and\nnature of the horizons crossed by an observer that travels\ninto the black hole singularity depends on the angular\ndirection x that he is following (see Fig. 1). This peculiar\nfeature is due to the lower restriction on the value of y\n(\u2212x \u2264 y), and a detailed discussion and explanation of it\ncan be found in [38] (such an angular dependence occurs\nalso in the flat C-metric [30], although not so sharply).\nFor example, when the observer is travelling towards the\nblack hole singularity following an angular direction in\nthe vicinity of the south pole (xs \u2264 x < \u2212yA ), he will\ncross only the outer y+ and inner y\u2212 black hole horizons\n(see Fig. 1), while when he does this trip following an\nangular direction in the vicinity of the equator (\u2212yA <\n\u2032\nx < \u2212yA\n), he crosses the acceleration horizon yA before\npassing through the black hole horizons y+ and y\u2212 .\nIn order to evaluate the black hole pair creation rate\nwe need to find the instantons of the theory, i.e., we must\nlook into the Euclidean section of the AdS C-metric and\nchoose those Euclidean solutions which are regular in a\nway that will be explained soon. The Euclidean section of\nthe AdS C-metric is obtained from the Lorentzian AdS\nC-metric by introducing an imaginary time coordinate\n\u03c4 = \u2212it in (1)-(4). To have a positive definite Euclidean\nmetric we must require that y belongs to yA \u2264 y \u2264 y+ .\nIn general, when y+ 6= y\u2212 , one then has conical singularities at the horizons y = yA and y = y+ . In order to\nobtain a regular solution we have to eliminate the conical\nsingularities at both horizons, ensuring in this way that\nthe system is in thermal equilibrium. This is achieved\nby imposing that the period of \u03c4 is the same for the two\nhorizons, and is equivalent to requiring that the Hawking\ntemperature of the two horizons be equal. To eliminate\nthe conical singularity at y = yA the period of \u03c4 must\nbe \u03b2 = 2\u03c0/kA (where kA is the surface gravity of the\nacceleration horizon),\n\u03b2=\n\n4\u03c0\n.\n|F \u2032 (yA )|\n\n(7)\n\nThis choice for the period of \u03c4 also eliminates simultaneously the conical singularity at the outer black hole\nhorizon, y+ , if and only if the parameters of the solution\nare such that the surface gravities of the black hole and\nacceleration horizons are equal (k+ = kA ), i.e.\nF \u2032 (y+ ) = \u2212F \u2032 (yA ) .\n\n(8)\n\nThis condition is satisfied by a regular Euclidean solution\nwith yA 6= y+ that will be referred to as nonextreme AdS\ninstanton.\nWe now turn our attention to the case y+ = y\u2212 (and\nyA 6= y+ ). When this happens the allowed range of y in\nthe Euclidean sector is simply yA \u2264 y < y+ . This occurs\nbecause when y+ = y\u2212 the proper distance along spatial\n\ndirections between yA and y+ goes to infinity. The point\ny+ disappears from the \u03c4, y section which is no longer\ncompact but becomes topologically S 1 \u00d7 R. Thus, in this\ncase we have a conical singularity only at yA , and so we\nobtain a regular Euclidean solution by simply requiring\nthat the period of \u03c4 be equal to (7). We will label this\nsolution by extreme AdS instanton.\nIn a de Sitter (dS) background there is another y+ 6=\ny\u2212 instanton which satisfies yA = y+ . It is called Nariai\ninstanton. Moreover, in the dS background, there is also\na special solution that satisfies yA = y+ = y\u2212 . It is\ncalled ultracold instanton. In the AdS C-metric case,\nthe counterparts of these dS instantons are of no interest\nfor the pair creation process because they are out of the\nallowed range of the angular direction x.\nIn Secs. II A and II B we will describe in detail the\nnonextreme AdS instanton with m = q and the extreme\nAdS instanton with y+ = y\u2212 , respectively. These instantons are the natural AdS C-metric counterparts of the\nlukewarm dS C and cold dS C instantons constructed\nin [37]. Thus, these instantons could also be labelled as\nlukewarm AdS C and cold AdS C instantons. Moreover,\nin Sec. II C, we will also describe saddle point solutions\nthat have conical singularities. These solutions represent\nnonextreme instantons with m 6= q. In Sec. II D we will\nstudy the background reference spacetime that describes\nthe initial system before the pair creation. These results\nwill allow us to calculate the pair creation rate of accelerated AdS black holes in Sec. III .\nA.\n\nThe nonextreme AdS instanton with m = q\n\nAs we said above, for the nonextreme AdS instanton the gravitational field is given by (1) with the requirement that F (y) satisfies F (y+ ) = 0 = F (yA ) and\nF \u2032 (y+ ) = \u2212F \u2032 (yA ). In this case we can then write\n\u0012\n\u00132 \u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\nyA y+\ny\ny\nF (y) = \u2212\n1\u2212\n1\u2212\nyA + y+\nyA\ny+\n\u0013\n\u0012\nyA + y+\ny2\n\u00d7 1+\n,\n(9)\ny\u2212\nyA y+\nyA y+\nwith\nyA =\n\n1\u2212\u03b1\n,\n2mA\ns\n\nand \u03b1 =\n\ny+ =\n\n1+\u03b1\n,\n2mA\n\n4m p 2\n1\u2212 \u221a\n3A \u2212 |\u039b| .\n3\n\n(10)\n\nThe parameters A, \u039b, m and q, written as a function of\nyA and y+ , are\n\u00132\n\u0012\n|\u039b|\nyA y+\n=\n,\n3A2\nyA + y+\nmA = (yA + y+ )\u22121 = qA .\n\n(11)\n\nThus, the mass and the charge of the nonextreme AdS\ninstanton are necessarily equal, m = q, as occurs with\n\n\f4\nits flat [4, 5, 9] and dS counterparts [11, 12, 37]. The\ndemand that \u03b1 is real requires that\ns\n1\n3\n,\n(12)\n0<m\u2264\n4 3A2 \u2212 |\u039b|\nand that\nA>\n\np\n|\u039b|/3 .\n\n(13)\n\nTherefore, as already anticipated, the nonextreme AdS\ninstanton is available only when (13) is satisfied.\nAs we said, the allowed range of y in the Euclidean\nsector is yA \u2264 y \u2264 y+ . Then, the period of \u03c4 , (7), that\navoids the conical singularity at both horizons is\n8\u03c0 mA\n,\n\u03b2=\n\u03b1(1 \u2212 \u03b12 )\n\n(14)\n\nand T = 1/\u03b2 is the common temperature of the two\nhorizons.\nUsing the fact that G(x) = |\u039b|/(3A2 ) \u2212 F (\u2212x) [see (2)]\nwe can write\n2\n\n2\n\nG(x) = 1 \u2212 x (1 + mA x) ,\n\nWhen m and q go to zero we have xs \u2192 \u22121 and xn \u2192 +1.\nThis is the reason why we decided to work in between\nthe roots xs and xn , instead of working in between the\nroots x\u2032s and x\u2032n also represented in Fig. 1. Indeed, when\nm \u2192 0 and q \u2192 0 these two last roots disappear, and\nour instanton has no vacuum counterpart. Now, the requirement that \u03c9\u2212 is p\nreal demands that mA < 1/4 [note\nthat 1/(4A) < (1/4) 3/(3A2 \u2212 |\u039b|), see (12)]. If this\nrequirement is not fulfilled then G(x) has only two real\nroots that are represented as x\u2032s and xn in Fig. 1 and, as\nwe have just said, in this case the solution has no counterpart in the m = 0 and q = 0 case. Therefore\nq we discard\n1\nthe solutions that satisfy 4A\n\u2264 m \u2264 14 3A23\u2212|\u039b| , and\nhereafter when we refer to the mass of the nonextreme\nAdS instanton we will be working in the range\n(17)\n\nThe period of \u03c6, (5), that avoids the conical singularity at the north pole (and leaves one at the south pole\nresponsible for the presence of the string) is\n\u2206\u03c6 =\n\n8\u03c0 mA\n2 \u2212 1) < 2\u03c0 .\n\u03c9+ (\u03c9+\n\nThe extreme AdS instanton with y+ = y\u2212\n\nThe gravitational field of the extreme AdS instanton\nis given by (1) with the requirement that the size of the\nouter charged black hole horizon y+ is equal to the size\nof the inner charged horizon y\u2212 . Let us label this degenerated horizon by \u03c1: y+ = y\u2212 \u2261 \u03c1 and \u03c1 > yA . In this\ncase, the function F (y) can be written as\nF (y) =\n\n\u03c12 \u2212 3\u03b3\n\u2032\n(y \u2212 yA\n)(y \u2212 yA )(y \u2212 \u03c1)2 ,\n\u03c14\n\n(19)\n\nwith\n\n\u22121 + \u03c9+\n\u22121 + \u03c9\u2212\n< 0,\nxn =\n> 0,\nxs =\n2mA \u221a\n2mA\nwith \u03c9\u00b1 = 1 \u00b1 4mA .\n(16)\n\n1\n,\n4A\n\nB.\n\n(15)\n\nand the roots of G(x) we are interested in are the south\nand north pole (represented, respectively, as xs and xn\nin Fig. 1),\n\n0<m\u2264\n\nWhen m and q go to zero we have \u2206\u03c6 \u2192 2\u03c0 and the\nconical singularity disappears.\nThe topology of the nonextreme AdS instanton is S 2 \u00d7\n2\nS \u2212 {region}, where S 2 \u00d7 S 2 represents 0 \u2264 \u03c4 \u2264 \u03b2,\nyA \u2264 y \u2264 y+ , xs \u2264 x \u2264 xn , and 0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 \u2206\u03c6, but we\nhave to remove the region, {region} = {{x, y} : xs \u2264\nx \u2264 \u2212yA \u2227 y + x = 0}.

Since y = y+ = \u03c1 is at an\ninfinite proper distance, the surface y = y+ = \u03c1 is an\ninternal infinity boundary. The Lorentzian sector of this\nextreme case describes two extreme (y+ = y\u2212 ) charged\nAdS black holes being accelerated by the strings, and\nthe extreme AdS instanton describes the pair creation of\nthese extreme black holes.\nC.\n\nThe nonextreme AdS instanton with m 6= q\n\nThe AdS C-metric instantons studied in the two last\nsubsections, namely the nonextreme instantons with m =\nq and the extreme instantons with y+ = y\u2212 , are saddle point solutions free of conical singularities both in\nthe y+ and yA horizons. The corresponding black holes\nmay then nucleate in the AdS background when a cosmic string breaks, and we will compute their pair creation\nrates in Sec. III. However, these particular black holes\nare not the only ones that can be pair created. Indeed,\nit has been shown in [41] that Euclidean solutions with\nconical singularities may also be used as saddle points for\nthe pair creation process. These nonextreme instantons\nhave m 6= q and describe pair creation of nonextreme\nblack holes with m 6= q.\nIn what follows we will find the range of parameters\nfor which one has nonextreme black holes with conical\nsingularities, i.e., with m 6= q. First, when m 6= 0 and\nq 6= 0, we require that x belongs to the interval [xs , xn ]\n(sketched in Fig. 1) for which the charged solutions are\nin the same sector of the m = 0 and q = 0 solutions.\nDefining\nr\nq2\n9\n8\n\u03c7\u2261 2 , 0<\u03c7\u2264 ,\n\u03b3\u00b1 \u2261 1 \u00b1 1 \u2212 \u03c7 ,\nm\n8\n9\n(4\u03c7)2 (3\u03b3\u00b1 )2 \u2212 8\u03c7(3\u03b3\u00b1 )3 + \u03c7(3\u03b3\u00b1 )4\n\u03c3(\u03c7, \u03b3\u00b1 ) =\n,\n(4\u03c7)4\n(31)\nthe above requirement is fulfilled by the parameter range\nm2 A2 < \u03c3(\u03c7, \u03b3\u2212 ) ,\n\n(32)\n\n\u2212 1\nfor which G(x = x0 ) < 0, with x0 = \u2212 3\u03b3\n4\u03c7 mA being\nthe less negative x where the derivative of G(x) vanishes.\nSecond, in order to insure that one has a nonextreme\nsolution we must require that\n\nm2 A2 > \u03c3(\u03c7, \u03b3+ ) + m2 |\u039b|/3 ,\n\n(33)\n\n+ 1\nfor which F (y = y0 ) < 0, with y0 = 3\u03b3\n4\u03c7 mA being\nthe point in between y+ and y\u2212 where the derivative\nof F (y) vanishes. We have \u03c3(\u03c7, \u03b3\u2212 ) > \u03c3(\u03c7, \u03b3+ ) except\nat \u03c7 = 9/8 where these two functions are equal; \u03c3(\u03c7, \u03b3\u2212 )\nis always positive; and \u03c3(\u03c7, \u03b3+ ) < 0 for 0 < \u03c7 < 1 and\n\u03c3(\u03c7, \u03b3+ ) > 0 for 1 < \u03c7 \u2264 9/8.

Now, if we want to\nmaintain the intrinsic properties of the string during the\nprocess we must impose that its mass density and thus\nits conical deficit remains constant. After the pair creation we already know that the conical deficit is given\nby (6). Hence, the requirement that the background solution describes an AdS spacetime with a conical deficit\nangle given exactly by (6) leads us to impose that in (37)\none has\n\nwith\nd = yA y+ y\u2212 (yA + y+ + y\u2212 ) + (yA y+ + yA y\u2212 + y+ y\u2212 )2\na = (yA y+ + yA y\u2212 + y+ y\u2212 )\nb = yA y+ y\u2212 .\n(35)\nThe parameters A, \u039b, m and q can be expressed as a\nfunction of yA , y+ and y\u2212 by\n\n(36)\n\nG \u2032 (xs )\n.\n|G \u2032 (xn )|\n\n(38)\n\nThe arbitrary parameter A0 can be fixed as a function\nof A by imposing a matching between (1) and (37) at\nlarge spatial distances.

In our case this action is\nthe Einstein-Maxwell action with a negative cosmological\nconstant \u039b. The path integral is over all compact metrics and potentials on manifolds M with boundary \u2202M,\n0\nwhich agree with the boundary data on \u2202M. I0 (g\u03bc\u03bd\n, A0\u03bc )\nis the action for the background reference spacetime, the\n0\nAdS background with the string, specified by g\u03bc\u03bd\nand\n0\nA\u03bc (see Sec. II D). Its presence is required because it\ndescribes the initial system. Moreover, the geometry of\nthe final system with the black hole pair is noncompact,\nthat is I(g\u03bc\u03bd , A\u03bc ) diverges. However, the physical action\n0\nI(g\u03bc\u03bd , A\u03bc ) \u2212 I0 (g\u03bc\u03bd\n, A0\u03bc ) is finite for fields g\u03bc\u03bd , A\u03bc that\n0\napproach asymptotically g\u03bc\u03bd\n, A0\u03bc in an appropriate way\n[42]. Specifically, one fixes a boundary near infinity, \u03a3\u221e ,\n0\nand demands that g\u03bc\u03bd , A\u03bc and g\u03bc\u03bd\n, A0\u03bc induce fields on\nthis boundary that agree to sufficient order, so that their\ndifference does not contribute to the action in the limit\nthat \u03a3\u221e goes to infinity [42].\nIn the semiclassical instanton approximation, the dominant contribution to the path integral (39) comes from\nmetrics and Maxwell fields which are near the solutions\n(instantons) that extremalize the Euclidean action and\nsatisfy the boundary conditions. In this approximation,\nthe pair creation rate of AdS black holes is then given by\n\u0393 \u223c \u03b7 e\u2212Iinst ,\n\n(40)\n\nwhere Iinst \u2261 I \u2212 I0 includes already the contribution\nfrom the background reference spacetime. \u03b7 is the oneloop prefactor that accounts for the fluctuations in the\ngravitational and matter fields, and its evaluation will\nnot be considered in this paper (see [14, 15, 43, 44] for a\ntreatment of this factor in some backgrounds).\nHawking and Horowitz [42] (see also Brown and York\n[45]) have shown that the Euclidean action of the instanton that mediates pair creation of nonextreme black holes\ncan be written in the form\n1\nIinst = \u03b2H \u2212 (\u2206Aac + Abh ) ,\n(41)\n4\nwhere \u2206Aac is the difference in area of the acceleration\nhorizon between the AdS C-metric and the background,\nand Abh is the area of the black hole horizon present\nin the instanton. The Euclidean action of the instanton\nthat describes pair creation of extreme black holes can\nbe written as\n1\nIinst = \u03b2H \u2212 \u2206Aac .\n(42)\n4\nIn these relations, \u03b2 is the period of the Euclidean time,\nand H represents the Hamiltonian of the system which,\nfor static solutions, is given by [42, 45]\nZ\nZ\n\u221a\n\u0001\n\u221a\n1\nd2 x \u03c3 N 2K \u2212 N0 2K0 .\nd3 x h N H \u2212\nH=\n8\u03c0 \u03a3\u221e\n\u03a3t\nt\n\n(43)\nThe boundary \u2202M consists of an initial and final spacelike surface, \u03a3t , of constant t with unit normal u\u03bc (u*u =\n\u22121) and with intrinsic metric h\u03bc\u03bd = g\u03bc\u03bd + u\u03bc u\u03bd plus a\ntimelike surface near infinity, \u03a3\u221e , with unit normal n\u03bc\n(n * n = 1, and u * n = 0) and with intrinsic metric\n\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd = h\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 n\u03bc n\u03bd . This surface \u03a3\u221e needs not to be at\ninfinity. It can also be at a black hole horizon or at an internal infinity, but we will generally label it by \u03a3\u221e . This\nsurface \u03a3\u221e is foliated by a family of 2-surfaces \u03a3\u221e\nt that\nresult from the intersection between \u03a3\u221e and \u03a3t . In (43),\nN and N0 are the lapse functions of the system with the\npair and of the background, respectively, and N = N0\nin the boundary near infinity, \u03a3\u221e . H is the hamiltonian\nconstraint that contains contributions from the gravitational and Maxwell fields, and vanishes for solutions of\nthe equations of motion. Then, the Hamiltonian is simply given by the boundary surface term. In this surface\nterm, 2K represents the trace of the extrinsic curvature\nof the surface imbedded in the AdS C-metric, and 2K0\nis the extrinsic curvature of the surface imbedded in the\nbackground spacetime.\nWe will now verify that the boundary surface term in\nthe Hamiltonian (43) is also zero, and thus the Hamiltonian makes no contribution to (41) and (42). We follow\nthe technical procedure applied by Hawking, Horowitz\nand Ross [8] in the Ernst solution and by Hawking and\nRoss [18] in the flat C-metric. As we said above, one will\nrequire that the intrinsic metric ds2(\u03a3\u221e ) on the boundary\nt\n\u03a3\u221e\nt as embedded in the AdS C-metric agrees (to sufficient\norder) with the intrinsic metric on the boundary \u03a3\u221e\nt as\nembedded in the background spacetime, in order to be\nsure that one is taking the same near infinity boundary\nin the evaluation of the quantities in the two spacetimes.\nIn the AdS C-metric one takes this boundary to be at\nx + y = \u03b5c , where \u03b5c \u226a 1. The background reference\nspacetime is described by (37), subjected to \u22121 \u2264 x \u2264 1,\ny \u2265 \u2212x and (38). In this background spacetime we take\nthe boundary \u03a3\u221e\nt to be at x + y = \u03b50 , where \u03b50 \u226a 1.\nWe are now interested in writing the intrinsic metric in\nthe boundary \u03a3\u221e\nt (the 2-surface t = const and x+y = \u03b5).\nIn the AdS C-metric (1) one performs the coordinate\ntransformation\n\u03c6=\n\n2\n\u03c6\u0303 ,\n|G \u2032 (xn )|\n\nt=\n\n2\nt\u0303\nF \u2032 (yA )\n\n(44)\n\nin order that \u2206\u03c6\u0303 = 2\u03c0, and the analytic continuation of\nt\u0303 has period 2\u03c0, i.e., \u2206\u03c4\u0303 = 2\u03c0. Furthermore, one takes\nx = xs + \u03b5c \u03c7 ,\n\ny = \u2212xs + \u03b5c (1 \u2212 \u03c7)\n\n(45)\n\nwhere 0 \u2264 \u03c7 \u2264 1. By making the evaluations up to\nsecond order in \u03b5c (since higher order terms will not contribute to the Hamiltonian in the final limit \u03b5c \u2192 0), the\nintrinsic metric on the boundary \u03a3\u221e\nt is then\n\u0014 2\n2\nd\u03c7\n\u223c 2\nds2(\u03a3\u221e\nt )\nA \u03b5c G \u2032 (xs ) 2\u03c7\n\n\f8\nG \u2032 (xs )\n+ \u2032\nG (xn )\n\n2\u0012\n\n\u0015\n\u0013\nG \u2032\u2032 (xs ) 2\n2\n2\u03c7 + \u03b5c \u2032\n\u03c7 d\u03c6\u0303 .

II A, and (58) using the\nresults of Sec. II B. In Sec. III C we analyze the pair\ncreation rate of black holes discussed in Sec. II C. Remark that the only horizons that contribute with their\nareas to (57) and (58) are those that belong to the instanton responsible for the pair creation, i.e, only those\nhorizons that are in the Euclidean sector of the instanton\nwill make a contribution.\nThe domain of validity of our results is the particle\nlimit, mA \u226a 1, for which the radius of the black hole,\nr+ \u223c m, is much smaller than the typical distance between the black holes at the creation moment, l \u223c 1/A\n(this value follows from the Rindler motion x2 \u2212t2 = 1/A2\nthat describes the uniformly accelerated motion of the\nblack holes).\nA.\n\nPair creation rate in the nonextreme case with\nm=q\n\nIn the nonextreme case, the instanton has two horizons\nin its Euclidean section, namely the acceleration horizon\n\n\f9\nat y = yA and the black hole horizon at y = y+ (the\n\u2032\nhorizons yA\nand y\u2212 do not belong to the instanton, see\nFig 1). The black hole horizon covers the whole range of\nthe angular coordinate x, xs \u2264 x \u2264 xn , and its area is\nZ\n\u221a\ngxx g\u03c6\u03c6 dx d\u03c6\nAbh =\ny=y+\n\nxn\n\ndx\n(x + y+ )2\nxn \u2212 xs\n4\u03c0\n,\n= 2 \u2032\nA |G (xn )| (xn + y+ )(xs + y+ )\n\n=\n\n1\nA2\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c6\n\n\u2206\u03c6\n\nZ\n\nxs\n\n(59)\n\nwhere y+ is given in (10), xs and xn are defined by (16),\nand \u2206\u03c6 is given by (18).\nThe acceleration horizon, yA defined in (10), of the\nnonextreme AdS instanton covers the angular range\n\u2212yA \u2264 x \u2264 xn (i.e., it is not present in the vicinity of the\nsouth pole), and is noncompact, i.e., its area is infinite.\nWe have to deal appropriately with this infinity. In order\nto do so, we first introduce a boundary at x = \u2212yA + \u03b5c\n(\u03b5c \u226a 1), and compute the area inside of this boundary,\nwhich yields\nZ\n\u221a\nAcac =\ngxx g\u03c6\u03c6 dx d\u03c6\ny=yA\nZ xn\nZ\ndx\n1\n= 2\nd\u03c6\n2\nA \u2206\u03c6\n\u2212yA +\u03b5c (x + yA )\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n4\u03c0\n,\n(60)\n\u2212\n= \u2212 2 \u2032\nA |G (xn )| xn + yA\n\u03b5c\nWhen we let \u03b5c \u2192 0, the term 1/\u03b5c diverges, and the\nacceleration horizon has an infinite area.

Our next task is to verify that these matching\n\nconditions between (\u03b5c , A) and (\u03b50 , A0 ) are such that the\ndivergent terms in (60) and (61) cancel each other. It is\nstraightforward to show that \u2206Aac = Acac \u2212 A0ac yields a\nfinite value if\n2A02 \u03b50 = A2 \u03b5c G \u2032 (xs ) .\n\n(62)\n\nThus, the matching conditions (49) and (50) satisfy condition (62), i.e., they indeed eliminate the divergencies in \u2206Aac . It is worthy to remark that with the\nchoices (49) and (50) the proper lengths of the boundaries x =R \u2212yA + \u03b5c and x = R\u22121 + \u03b50 , (given, respectively,\n\u221a\n\u221a\ng\u03c6\u03c6 d\u03c6 and l0 =\ng\u03c60 \u03c60 d\u03c60 ) do not match.\nby lc =\nThis is in contrast with the flat case [18], in which the\nchoice of the matching parameters that avoids the infinities in \u2206Aac , also leads to lc = l0 . In the AdS case,\nour main goal was to remove the infinities in \u2206Aac . We\nhave achieved this aim by comparing the appropriate acceleration horizons in the instanton and in the reference\nbackground. The fact that the matching relations then\nlead to lc 6= l0 is not a problem at all.

The pair creation rate decreases as the mass\nof the black holes increases, and the pair creation rate\nincreases when A increases.\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n\nWe have studied in detail the quantum process in\nwhich a cosmic string breaks in an anti-de Sitter (AdS)\nbackground and a pair of black holes is created at the\nends of the string. The energy to materialize and accelerate the black holes comes from the strings tension.\nThe analysis of this process in a flat background (\u039b = 0)\nhas been carried in [18], while in a de Sitter background\n(\u039b > 0) it has been done in [28]. In an AdS background\nthis is the only study done in the process of production\nof a pair of correlated black holes with spherical topology. We remark that in principle our explicit values for\nthe pair creation rates also apply to the process of pair\ncreation in an external electromagnetic field, with the\nacceleration being provided in this case by the Lorentz\nforce instead of being furnished by the string tension. Indeed, there is no AdS Ernst solution, and thus we cannot\ndiscuss analytically the process. However, physically we\ncould in principle consider an external electromagnetic\nfield that supplies the same energy and acceleration as\nour strings and, from the results of the \u039b = 0 case (where\nthe pair creation rates in the string and electromagnetic\ncases agree), we expect that the pair creation rates found\nin this paper do not depend on whether the energy is being provided by an external electromagnetic field or by a\nstring.\n\nIt is well known that the AdS background is attractive,\ni.e., an analysis of the geodesic equations indicates that\nparticles in this background are subjected to a potential\nwell that attracts them (see also Appendix B). Therefore,\nif we have a virtual pair of black holes and we want to\nturn them real, we will have to furnish a sufficient force\nthat overcomes this cosmological background attraction.\nWe then expect that pair creation is possible only if the\nstrings tension and the associated acceleration A is higher\nthan a critical value. We have confirmed that this is\nindeed the case: in the AdS background, black holes can\nbe pair produced only with an acceleration higher than\np\n|\u039b|/3.\nWe have constructed the saddle point solutions that\nmediate the pair creation process through the analytic\ncontinuation of the AdS C-metric, and we have explicitly computed the pair creation rate of the process. The\nAdS pair creation rate reduces to the corresponding one\nof the flat case [18] when we set \u039b = 0. We have concluded that, for a pair of black holes that is subjected\nto a fixed \u039b and A backgrounds, the pair creation probability decreases when the mass or charge of the black\nholes increases. Moreover, when we fix the mass and the\ncharge of the black holes, the probability they have to\nbe pair created increases when the acceleration provided\nby the string increases. These results are physically expected, as an heuristic derivation done in Appendix B\nconfirms. This process has also a clear analogy with a\nthermodynamical system, with the mass density of the\nstring (that is proportional to A) being the analogue of\nthe temperature T . Indeed, from the Boltzmann factor,\ne\u2212E0 /(kB T ) (where kB is the Boltzmann constant), one\nknows that a higher background temperature makes the\nnucleation of a particle with energy E0 more probable.\nEquivalently, a higher acceleration provided by the string\nmakes the creation of the black hole pair more probable.\nFor the benefit of comparison, in Fig. 3 we schematically represent the general behavior of the black hole pair\ncreation rate \u0393 as a function of the acceleration A provided by the strings, when a cosmic string breaks in the\nthree cosmological constant backgrounds. In a flat background [see Fig. 3.(a)], the pair creation rate is zero when\nA = 0 [18]. In this case, the flat C-metric reduces to a\nsingle black hole, and since we are studying the probability of pair creation, the corresponding rate is naturally\nzero. This does not mean that a single black hole cannot\nbe materialized from the quantum vacuum, it only means\nthat this latter process is not described by the C-metric.\nThe creation probability of a single black hole in a hot\nbath has been considered in [44]. In a dS background [see\nFig. 3.(b)], the pair creation rate is not zero when A = 0\n[28]. This means that even in the absence of the string,\nthe positive cosmological constant is enough to provide\nthe energy to materialize the black hole pair [12]. If in\naddition one has an extra energy provided by the string,\nthe process becomes more favorable [28]. In the AdS\ncase [see Fig. 3.(c)], the negative cosmological constant\nmakes a negative contribution to the process, and black\n\n\f11\n(a)\n\nflat case\n\n\u0393\n\npara a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia (FCT) through project\nCERN/FIS/43797/2001 and PESO/PRO/2000/4014.

This work was partially funded by Funda\u00e7\u00e3o\n\nIn a flat background (\u039b = 0), the analysis of the process of pair creation of black holes when a cosmic string\nbreaks has been analyzed by Hawking and Ross [18]. In\nthis case, there is a direct \u039b = 0 counterpart of the nonextreme AdS instanton and of the extreme AdS instanton\ndiscussed in our AdS case. These instantons describe\npair creation of nonextreme (with m = q) and extreme\nblack holes with y+ = y\u2212 , respectively [18]. The total\narea of these \u039b = 0 instantons can be found in [18], and\ncan be obtained by taking the direct \u039b = 0 limit of (59)\nand (63), together with the replacement yA 7\u2192 \u2212xs . This\nprocedure yields that (59) also holds in the \u039b = 0 case,\nwhile \u2206Aac becomes\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1 G \u2032\u2032 (xs )\n4\u03c0\n. (A1)\n+\n\u2206Aac = \u2212 2 \u2032\nA |G (xn )| xn \u2212 xs\n2 G \u2032 (xs )\nIn [18] the explicit numerical value of Abh and \u2206Aac has\nnot been computed. We will do it here.\nFor the \u039b = 0 nonextreme case, the discussion of Sec.\nII A applies generically, as long as we set \u039b = 0 in the corresponding equations. With this data we find the explicit\nvalue of the total area of the nonextreme flat instanton\np\n\u03c0 \u22121 + 4mA + 1 \u2212 (4mA)2\np\nAbh + \u2206Aac = \u2212 2\n.\nA\n1 \u2212 (4mA)2\n(A2)\n\nIn the particle limit, mA \u226a 1, the above relation reduces\nto \u2212\u03c0m/(4A) and the mass density of the string is given\n2\nby \u03bc \u223c mA. The pair creation rate is then \u0393 \u223c e\u2212\u03c0m /\u03bc .\nThus, as occurs with the AdS case, the pair creation rate\ndecreases when m increases and the rate increases when\nA or \u03bc increase [see Fig. 3.(a)].\nWe remark that for mA \u223c 1, and as occurs in the corresponding AdS case, the pair creation rate associated\nto (A2) starts decreasing when A increases. This is a\nphysically unexpected result since a higher acceleration\nprovided by the string background should favor the nucleation of a fixed black hole mass. The sector mA \u223c 1\nmust then be discarded and the reason is perfectly identified: the domain of validity of the rates is mA \u226a 1,\nfor which the radius of the black hole, r+ \u223c m, is much\nsmaller than the typical distance between the black holes\nat the creation moment, l \u223c 1/A (this value follows from\nthe Rindler motion x2 \u2212 t2 = 1/A2 that describes the\nuniformly accelerated motion of the black holes). So, for\nmA \u223c 1 one has r+ \u223c l and the black holes start interacting with each other.\n\n\f12\nIn what concerns the pair creation rate of extreme and\nnonextreme with m = q \u039b = 0 black holes, an explicit\ncomputation shows that its general behavior with A and\nm is also similar to the one of the AdS case, i.e., the rate\ndecreases when m or q increase, and the rate increases\nwhen A increases.\n\nIn order to clarify the physical interpretation of the\nresults, in this Appendix we heuristically derive some\nresults discussed in the main body of the paper. In particular, we find heuristically the pair creation rates.\nIn an AdS background, pair creation of black holes\nis possible only whenpthe acceleration provided by the\nstrings satisfies A > |\u039b|/3. To understand this result\none can argue as follows. In general, the time-time component of the gravitational field is given by g00 = 1 \u2212 2\u03a6,\nwhere \u03a6 is the Newtonian potential. In the AdS spacetime, one has \u03a6 = \u2212|\u039b|r2 /6 and its derivative yields the\nforce per unit mass or p\nacceleration of the AdS spacetime,\nAAdS = \u2212|\u039b|r/3 \u223c \u2212 |\u039b|/3, where we have replaced r\n\u22121/2\nby the characteristic AdS radius (|\u039b|/3)\n. The minus\nsign indicates that the AdS background is attractive and\nthus, if one wants to have a pair of accelerated black holes\ndriving away from each other, the cosmic string will have\nto provide a sufficient acceleration A that overcomes the\nAdS background attraction, i.e., A > |AAdS |.\nAn estimate for the black hole pair creation probability can be given by the Boltzmann factor, \u0393 \u223c e\u2212E0 /Wext ,\nwhere E0 is the energy of the system that nucleates and\n\nWext = F l is the work done by the external force F ,\nthat provides the energy for the nucleation, through the\ntypical distance l separating the created pair. First we\nask what is the probability that a black hole pair is\ncreated in a \u039b = 0 background when a string breaks.\nThis process has been discussed in [18] (see also Appendix A) where it was found that the pair creation\nrate is \u0393 \u223c e\u2212m/A . In this case, E0 \u223c 2m, where m\nis the rest energy of the black hole, and Wext \u223c A is\nthe work provided by the strings. To derive Wext \u223c A\none can argue as follows. The acceleration provided by\nthe string is A, the characteristic distance that separates\nthe pair at the creation moment is 1/A (see Appendix\nA), and the characteristic mass of the system is A by\nthe Compton relation. Thus, the characteristic work is\nWext = mass \u00d7 acceleration \u00d7 distance \u223c AAA\u22121 . So,\nfrom the Boltzmann factor we indeed expect that the\ncreation rate of a black hole pair when a string breaks in\na \u039b = 0 background is given by \u0393 \u223c e\u2212m/A .\nNow we ask what is the probability that a string breaks\nin an AdS background and a pair of black holes is produced. As we saw just above, the presence of the AdS\nbackground leads in practice to a problempin which we\nhave a net acceleration that satisfies A\u2032 \u2261 A2 \u2212 |\u039b|/3,\nthis is, \u039b makes a negative contribution to the process. Heuristically, we may then apply the same arguments that have been used in the last paragraph, with\nthe replacement A \u2192 A\u2032 . At the end, the Boltzmann\nfactor tells\u221aus that the creation rate for the process is\n2\n\u0393 \u223c e\u2212m/ A \u2212|\u039b|/3 . So, given m and \u039b, when the acceleration provided by the string grows the pair creation\nrate increases, as the explicit calculations done in the\nmain body of the paper show.\n\n[1] G. W.
