These studies lead to new classification schemes [3\u20138] of the quantum phases beyond the usual Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson\nparadigm. The new quantum phases such as the spin liquids are called the topological phases\nand cannot be characterized by a local order parameter. Instead, it could be characterized\nby the ground state degeneracy, quasiparticle statistics, existence of edge states, topological\nentanglement entropy [9, 10], and entanglement spectrum [11], i.e., eigen-spectrum of the\nreduced density matrix. The latter twos are motivated by the quantum information studies\non the entangled nature of ground state, which could be efficiently approximated by the projected entangled pair state ansatz [12]. One typical example for all the above characteristics\nof topological ordered state is the fractional quantum Hall states [13, 14].\nFor one-dimensional (1D) spin chain the quantum fluctuation could be more significant\nthan in the higher dimensional ones so that it will melt the system into liquid, and thus\nbecoming topological. The simplest example of the \"topological phase\" is the Haldane phase.\nThe term with the quotation remark is to remind that the topological nature of the ground\nstate is protected by some symmetry of the spin chain [3, 4]. Once the symmetry is broken,\nthe ground state wave function is equivalent to a trivial product state up to some local\nunitary transformation [15]. The local unitary transformations can remove the short range\nentanglement, i.e., entanglement between the neighboring sites. In contrast, the long range\nentanglement is the entanglement among the distant sites, and cannot be removed by the\nlocal unitary transformations. Due to its robustness against the local operations, the long\nrange entanglement causes the topological order of the nontrivial ground state.\nOn the other hand, for two-dimensional (2D) spin systems the topological phase is usually\nexpected to exist in the frustrated systems since the large ground state degeneracy of the\nsystem is highly quantum and cannot have simple classical order. However, suffering from the\n2\n\n\flack of the reliable numerical tools in solving the 2D frustrated spin systems, only very few\ntopological phases have been identified, except for some particularly exactly solvable models\n[16\u201318]. The connection between the topological order and the quantum entanglement is\nless understood than in the 1D cases.\nDespite of the recent progress in [3\u20138] on the general scheme of classifying the topological\norders caused by the long range entanglement, it is still not easy in practical to dynamically\ndetermine if exists a topological phase. It is then desirable to find a more numerical viable\ncharacterization for the topological order. Since the topological order is believed to be\nlinked to the long range entanglement, we think the degeneracy pattern of the entanglement\nspectrum can be such an index. The intuitive picture is that the entanglement spectrum is\nthe Schmidt values of the bi-partition of the whole system [4, 8], so the dominant degenerate\nsingular values implies that the wave function is close to the maximally entangled state (Bell\nstate). In this case, the two parts of the system is coherently long-range entangled.\nThe entanglement spectrum is easy to evaluate numerically for 1D spin systems in the\nansatz of matrix product states (MPS) because it coincides with the Schmidt value spectrum\nof the bi-partition, and can be obtained by performing the singular value decomposition\n(SVD) for the matrix of the MPS. Indeed, the connection between entanglement spectrum\nand topological order is established for the MPS numerically [4]. However, this is not the case\nfor the 2D tensor product state (TPS) because the left and right states of the bi-partition\nare now the 1D spin chains [8], and the corresponding entanglement spectrum is not the\nsame as the singular value spectrum. The latter is obtained by merging two neighboring\n1-site tensors in TPS and then performing the SVD on the merging tensor. Despite that,\nthese twos should be related, especially for the translationally invariant states. Therefore,\nif the entanglement spectrum can be used to characterize the 2D topological order, so does\nthe singular value spectrum. Indeed, we will see this is the case in this work.\nThe main motivation of this paper is to establish such an connection in 2D among topological order, long range entanglement and degenerate singular value spectrum by numerically\nstudying a particular frustrated 2D spin model with its ground state in the form of the TPS\nansatz. In the meantime we explore the properties of the singular value spectrum under\nvarious types of the local unitary transformations to test its robustness, which is the main\ncharacteristics of the topological order.\nThe model we will study is the staggered dimer spin 1/2 model on the square lattice,\n3\n\n\fand will be referred as the J-J' model form now on. It is an interesting 2D spin model with\nvarious issues about quantum phase transition. For the antiferromagnetic J 0 -bond regime,\ni.e., J 0 /J > 0, this model has been studied by using the perturbation theory [19, 20], exact\ndiagonalization [21], the coupled cluster method [21], iPEPS [22] and quantum Monte Carlo\n[23, 24]. In this regime, there exists a quantum phase transition by tuning J 0 with a critical\npoint at J 0 /J \u2248 2.51 [19], separating the classical N\u00e9el ordered phase and a finite-gap\ndisordered phase [23, 24].\nIn this paper we are more interested in the regime of the ferromagnetic J 0 -bond, i.e.,\nJ 0 /J < 0 because the plaquettes are now frustrated. The quantum Monte Carlo method\ncannot be used for the frustrated system because of the sign problem. Instead, some meanfield based approximation methods such as the renormalized spin wave theory [20], exact\ndiagonalization [21] and coupled cluster method [21] have been used to study this regime.\nThese studies found a phase transition at J 0 /J = \u22121/3 separating the N\u00e9el phase from a\nhelical phase for classical spins, and the maximal frustration occurs around J 0 \u2248 1 region.\nHowever, due to the frustrations we suspect that a quantum spin liquid phase with topological order may appear around the region of maximal frustration. We indeed find this is the\ncase from our study.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In the next section we describe the Iterative Projection\nmethod of solving the 2D TPS ground state [25], in the literatures this method is also\nreferred as the \"simplified update\" [26]. This is the 2D generalization of the infinite time\nevolving block decimation (iTEBD) [27]. We also review the method of the the tensornetwork renormalization group (TRG) [28, 29], which are used to find the overlap of the\nwave functions in a polynomially efficient way. Based on these, we can obtain the singular\nvalue spectrum and topological entanglement entropy, and also perform the quantum state\nrenormalization. We also briefly review the above concepts. In section 3 we present the phase\ndiagram of the J-J' model by evaluating the order parameter, entanglement entropy, dimer\nstrength and the ground state energy. In section 4 we evaluate the topological entanglement\nentropy for the J-J' model and a toric code like state to characterize the topological phase. In\nsection 5 we focus on various properties of the singular value spectrum and its degeneracy\nto establish its connection with the topological order. Finally, we conclude our paper in\nsection 6.\n\n4\n\n\fII.\n\nTHE MODEL AND THE METHOD\n\nThe model we study in this paper is the staggered dimer model on square lattice, also\nknown as the J-J' model. It is a quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnetic model with two\nkinds of nearest-neighbor exchange couplings, and its Hamiltonian is\nH=J\n\nX\n\nS~i * S~j + J 0\n\nX\n\nS~i * S~j ,\n\n(1)\n\n<ij>0\n\n<ij>\n\nwhere the summations over < ij > and < ij >0 represent sums over the nearest-neighbor\nbonds as shown in Fig.1. Each square lattice consists of three J bonds (the thin ones) and\none J 0 bond (the thick one). We fix the J bonds to be antiferromagnetic, i.e., J > 0, and\nconsider \u2212\u221e < J 0 /J < \u221e as the parameter of this model.\n\nJ\n\nGA\n\nGB\n\nJ'\n\nGD\n\nGC\n\nFIG. 1: The J-J' model on the 2D square lattice with two different nearest neighboring bond\ncouplings J and J' (thin and thick, respectively). The red dash square is a 2 \u00d7 2 unit cell.\n\nA.\n\nSolving the model with Iterative Projection and TRG\n\nWe will use the Iterative Projection algorithm [25] (a.k.a. simplified update [26]) to find\nthe translationally invariant ground state of the system in the form of the tensor product\n\n5\n\n\fstate ansatz\nX\n\n|\u03c8i =\n\ntT r[A[1,1] (s1,1 )A[1,2] (s1,2 ) . . . A[N,N ] (sN,N )]|s1,1 , s1,2 , . . . , sN,N i\n\n(2)\n\ns1,1 ,s1,2 ,...,sN,N\n\nwhere si,j labels the physical spin of dimension ds at site (i, j) for i, j = 1, . . . , N ,\n[i,j]\n\nAr,d,l,u (si,j )'s are rank-five tensors with the bond indices r, d, l, u = 1, * * * , \u03c7, and tT r is\nto sum over all indices of tensors. We call \u03c7 the bond dimension and ds the physical dimension. This ansatz is able to handle an area-law by construction, but that doesn't mean\nthat the true ground state of the system necessarily obeys it. Depending on the situation,\nwe should tune \u03c7 to fully capture the essential feature of the ground state.\nThe basic idea of Iterative Projection method is to evolve the system along the imaginary\ntime in a very small time step so that the time evolution operator can be expanded as a\nsequence of two-site unitary operations through the Suzuki-Trotter decompositions. For\nlong enough time evolution, the system will go to the ground state we are solving for. We\nfurther assume translational invariance of the ground state ansatz (2), then we only need to\nupdate 4 tensors as shown in Fig. 1 inside a unit cell for each time step.\nBased on the solved ground state from Iterative Projection method, we can calculate\nsome quantities to characterize the phase diagrams. For the symmetry breaking phase we\ncan evaluate the order parameters which are the vacuum expectation value (vev) of some\nphysical operators. However, when we insert a physical operator at some particular site\nsuch that the translational invariance is lost, one needs some efficient method to contract\nthe exponentially large number of bounds. Here we will adopt the TRG method [28, 29]\nto do that. The basic idea of TRG is to renormalize the tensors of the TPS by keeping\nthe relevant entanglement when coarse graining. In this way, we can reduce the size of\nthe system while retaining the essential quantum correlations of the original ground state.\nFinally the whole system will be reduced to a unit cell with the renormalized tensor, we\ncan then evaluate the vev's faithfully enough within the renormalized unit cell. Besides,\nthere are alternative ways to implement polynomially efficient evaluation of the vev. One\ninteresting method is to contract the tensors in the 1D scheme vertically and horizontally\n[30], and the other one is to use the Monte Carlo sampling to enhance the rate of contracting\nthe tensors [31].\n\n6\n\n\fB.\n\nOrder parameters for N\u00e9el and dimer phases\n\nFor the J-J' model considered here, we will evaluate the N\u00e9el order parameter i.e., given\nPN\ni\nz\nby Msz = M1\ni=1 (\u22121) h\u03c8g |Si |\u03c8g i to characterize the N\u00e9el ordered phase. We also evaluate\nthe spin-spin correlations and the dimerization [32\u201334]:\n~i,j * S\n~i+1,j i \u2212 hS\n~i+1,j * S\n~i+2,j i|\nDx = |hS\n\n(3)\n\n~i,j * S\n~i+1,j i \u2212 hS\n~i,j * S\n~i,j+1 i|\nDy = |hS\n\n(4)\n\nand\n\nto characterize the dimmer strength of the disordered \"dimer phase\". Note that the Hamiltonian of the model does not possess the dimerized order by construction. Besides, we also\nuse TRG to evaluate the ground-state energy per site as\n\nC.\n\nE\nN\n\n= h\u03c8g |H|\u03c8g i/N .\n\nCharacterizing topological phase by topological entanglement entropy\n\nOn the other hand, it is more difficult to characterize the topological phase since there\nis no symmetry breaking order parameter for it. On typical quantity for the 2D systems\nis the topological entanglement entropy [9, 10]. It is the sub-leading constant term in the\nentanglement entropy\nSL = \u03b1L \u2212 \u03b3 + O(L\u2212\u03bd ) ,\n\n\u03bd>0,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere L is the boundary size of the block for which the entanglement entropy is evaluated\nby tracing out the degrees of freedom outside it.\nSince the constant term \u03b3 is topological and universal, we can extract it by appropriately subtracting the entanglement entropies of different blocks. There are two subtraction\nschemes, one is proposed by Kitaev and Preskill [9], and the other is by Levin and Wen [10].\nFor the square lattice it is easier to implement the numerical evaluation of the entanglement\nentropy for a square or rectangular block. In this case, we find that it is convenient to adopt\nKitaev-Preskill's scheme as shown in the left of Fig. 2 for the square block with even number\nof sites on each side of the square block. The extraction for the topological entanglement\nentropy then goes as follows\nKP\nStopo\n= SA + SB + SC + SD \u2212 SAB \u2212 SBC \u2212 SCD \u2212 SAD + SABCD ,\n\n7\n\n(6)\n\n\fA\n\nB\n\nA\nB\n\nD\n\nC\n\nC\nD\n\nFIG. 2: Two schemes for evaluating the topological entanglement entropy.

It has been used to characterize the topological order for some quantum\nHall states [11], and recently to characterize some symmetry-protected topological ordered\nHaldane phase in spin 1 chain [4]. The entanglement spectrum is refereed to the spectrum\nof the Schmidt values for the bi-partition of the whole system. By definition, these Schmidt\nvalues are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix of either of the\ntwo partitions. Basically, the degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum implies the spins at\ndifferent sites are almost in the maximally entangled state, hence it implies that the ground\n8\n\n\fstate has topological order. In 1D, the entanglement spectrum is the same as the singular\nvalue spectrum of the matrix product state, and its power in characterizing the topological\norder is fully demonstrated [3\u20135, 7]. However, for general 2D spin system there is no consensus on the power of entanglement spectrum in characterizing the topological order, see\n[8] for recent study on this issue 1 . Despite that, one may expect that it still works in 2D\nsince the topological order is closely related to the long range entanglement characterized\nby the degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum.\nUnlike the 1D case, the 2D entanglement spectrum is not the same as the singular value\nspectrum of the 1-site tensor in TPS though these twos should be related, especially for\ntranslationally invariant states. Numerical task in evaluating the 2D entanglement spectrum\nis almost the same as for the topological entanglement entropy, and thus difficult. Instead,\nit is far more easier and straightforward to evaluate singular value spectrum for TPS by\nmerging the tensors of neighboring sites along x- or y-direction and then doing SVD. In this\nway, we can obtain four kinds of the singular value spectrum, which are associated with the\nfour different links out of a site. For example, in the J-J' model there are three J-bonds\nand one J 0 -bond, and they may have different singular spectrum. This can be done by just\nusing Iterative Projection method without further invoking TRG.\nBesides, from the singular value spectrum one can straightforwardly evaluate the bipartite\nentanglement measure per length as well as the single-site von Neumann entropy (1-tangle).\nBoth can be used to characterize the quantum critical point [35].\n\nE.\n\nQuantum state renormalization\n\nSince the topological order is closely related to the long range entanglement, which however, is usually contaminated by the short range entanglement. In order to make the characteristic of the topological order more explicit, one can implement the quantum state\nrenormalization method [15, 37\u201339], which can remove the short range entanglement by\nperforming local unitary transformation. The successive quantum state renormalization will\nthen flow the original state to a simpler fixed-point state, which, however, has the same\n1\n\nIn [8], the entanglement spectrum of a bulk region is associated with a the boundary excitation spectrum.\nTheir numerical study revealed that the boundary Hamiltonians become non-local for the topologically\nordered states.\n\n9\n\n\ftopological order of the original state. We can then classify the topologically ordered phases\nby the TPS's tensors of the fixed-point states.\nWe now briefly describe the method as follows, and for more details see [39]. We first\nform a positive double tensor T by merging two layers of tensors T and T \u2020 with the physical\nindices contracted. Note that the resultant double tensor is constructed so that it is invariant\nunder the local unitary transformation, and then we can spectrally decompose it again back\ninto two tensors T\u0303 with physical indices. The spectral weights encode the relevance of the\nentangled components. In this step we have removed the short range entanglement by the\nlocal unitary transformation taking the tensor T into T\u0303 according to the significance of\nthe spectral weights. Next, we will coarse grain the lattice labelled by the tensor T\u0303 by\nimplementing one step of block decimation in the TRG method.\nAfter repeating the above steps the original TPS will then flow into a fixed-point state\nwith all the short range entanglement removed. If we perform quantum state renormalization\nwhile keeping the symmetry or gauge symmetry of the lattice, the final fixed-point tensors\ncan then be used to classify the topological phases according to the symmetry structure.\n\nIII.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS FOR THE PHASE DIAGRAM OF J-J' MODEL\n\nIn this section, we will present the numerical results for the phase diagrams of the J-J'\nmodel of system size N = 28 \u00d7 28 .\nWe first evaluate the vev of staggered magnetization Msz in ground state as a function\nof J 0 /J by using the TRG method, and the result is shown in Fig. 2. In our calculation\nwe consider the bond dimension up to \u03c7 = 6 and keep Dcut \u2265 \u03c72 to ensure the accuracy of\nthe TRG calculation. Here, Dcut is the cutoff on the bond dimension of the merging lattice\nduring the coarse graining in the TRG method. We find that the numerical results converge\nquickly along range entanglementady for \u03c7 = 4 and the numerical program works efficiently.\nTherefore, we will take \u03c7 = 4 and keep Dcut = 24 in our numerical study in this paper.\nFrom Fig. 3, it is observed that hMsz i drops to zero both at J 0 /J \u2248 2.56 and J 0 /J \u2248\n\u22120.54. This indicates two quantum critical points at the corresponding critical values of\nJ 0 /J. It was known that a second-order transition from a N\u00e9el-ordered phase to a finitegap disorder phase occurs at J 0 /J \u2248 2.51, which is obtained from the unbiased quantum\nMonte Carlo simulation [23, 24].

It indicates a second-order phase transition from N\u00e9el to a disordered (dimerized)\nphase at J 0 /J \u2248 2.56, and another quantum critical point at J 0 /J \u2248 \u22120.54 separating the N\u00e9el\nphase from a possible topological phase.\n\nThe discrepancy could be due to the not large enough \u03c7 used in our numerical calculation.\nFurthermore, we fit the critical exponent \u03b2 for the magnetization, i.e., Ms = A|J 0 \u2212 Jc0 |\u03b2 .\nOur result is \u03b2 ' 0.37691, which is close to the exponents of the 3D classical Heisenberg\n(O(3)) model, i.e., \u03b2 ' 0.3639 \u00b1 0.0035 2 .\nThe other critical point at J 0 /J \u2248 \u22120.54 is frustrated since J 0 < 0 and J > 0, and\nthere is possibility for the existence of topologically ordered phase due to the underlying\ndegeneracy of the frustrated ground state. In Fig. 4 we show how the critical behavior in\nthis regime changes when we change the bond dimension. Our result showing hMsz i = 0 for\nJ 0 /J < \u22120.54 is consistent with this expectation for a topologically ordered phase.\nSince the system is frustrated in the regime of J 0 /J < 0, our method based on TPS\nand TRG will be more reliable than the others. Despite that, we still compare with the\n2\n\nBy increasing \u03c7 one may improve the above the results to be close to the results by the quantum Monte\nCarlo method, though it may require far large computational power.

For \u03c7 = 6 it indicates a\nsecond order phase transition at J 0 /J ' \u22120.54.\n\nresults from the other methods. It was shown that classically there is a second order phase\ntransition from the N\u00e9el phase to a helical phase at J 0 /J ' \u22121/3 based on renormalized spin\nwave theory (RSWT) [20] or exact diagonalization (ED) [21]. Furthermore, it was claimed\nin [21] that the critical point shifts to J 0 /J ' \u22121.35 by using the coupled cluster method\n(CCM) to take the quantum fluctuations into account. However, we do not see such a shift\nin our results. Instead, we evaluate the ground state energy by TRG method and find the\nvalue is very close to the one obtained by the method of RSWT for a helical phase, especially\nin the N\u00e9el (classical) regime. The result is shown in Fig. 5. We see that for J 0 /J < \u22120.5\nthe agreement in energy between ours and RSTW's starts to deviate, and our translationally\ninvariant ground state is energetically more favored than the non-translationally invariant\nhelical state. Similar deviation occurs for J 0 /J > 2, this again reflects the relevance of\nquantum effect when the system is away from the classical N\u00e9el ordered regime.\nFor curiosity, we also calculate the dimerization Dx and Dy defined in (3) and (4) though\nthey are not the order parameters of our dimerized model. The results is shown in Fig. 6.\nWe see that Dx = Dy = 0 at J 0 /J = 1 as expected, otherwise they are nonzero and reach\nsome constant values at the disordered (dimer) regime.

The discontinuities in the derivative of\n\nthe entanglement measure occur right at the quantum critical points, and the classical N\u00e9el regime\nhas lower entanglement.\n\nEspecially, for the TPS ansatz it is quite straightforward to evaluate the bipartite entangleP\n\u03b1\nment per bond SBP\n:= \u2212 i \u03bb2\u03b1,i log \u03bb2\u03b1,i , where \u03b1 = J, J 0 labels the two different types of\nthe bonds, and the \u03bb\u03b1,i 's are the singular values obtained from the SVD of the site tensors in\nperforming the Iterative Projection algorithm. Similarly, one can also use TRG to obtain the\n\n14\n\n\fone-site reduced density matrix, and then evaluate the von Neumann entropy, i.e., 1-tangle\ndenoted as S1 . The results are summarized in Fig. 8. Note that the derivatives of both S1\n0\n\nJ,J\nand SBP\nare discontinuous at two quantum critical points. Moreover, it shows that the clas-\n\nsical N\u00e9el regime has lower entanglement compared to the other two phases dictated by the\nsignificant quantum effect. For the disordered dimer phase with J 0 /J > 2.56 quite amount\nof the quantum entanglement is due to the formation of the dimers, i.e., nearest-neighboring\nsites form the maximally entangled states (Bell states). Once the dimer is formed, the sites\non the both ends of the dimer will not be correlated with the other sites, i.e., the monogamy\nof the entanglement.\nThe local nature of short range entanglement for the dimer phase is different from the\nlong range entanglement for the topological phase in the regime J 0 /J < \u22120.54. Later, we\nwill see that the difference between these twos will be reflected in the degeneracy of the\nsingular value spectrum.\n\nIV.\n\nTOPOLOGICAL ENTANGLEMENT ENTROPY\n\nIn this section, we will evaluate the topological entanglement entropy based on TPS\nansatz. We will consider first the J-J' model, and then a toric code like toy TPS state to\ndemonstrate the power of TRG method in identifying the topological phase.\n\nA.\n\nJ-J' model\n\nIn order to make sure that the phase in the regime J 0 /J < \u22120.54 is the topological phase,\nwe evaluate the topological entanglement entropy (i.e., \u2212\u03b3) according to the prescriptions\nmentioned before. We also find that the entanglement entropy increases linearly with the\nblock boundary size, this gives a consistent check for our numerical codes.\nOur result is shown in Fig. 9. The one for 2 by 2 block is evaluated by Kitaev-Preskill's\nscheme, and the one for 3 by 3 block by Levin-Wen's scheme. For larger blocks, it requires\nfar more power of computation in TRG for evaluating the block entanglement entropy. For\nexample, if we would like to evaluate the entanglement entropy for the 4 by 4 block, then\nthe number of entries for the reduced density matrix will be about 216 /29 = 128 times of the\none for 3 by 3 block. That means it will take about 100 times of the computing time than\n\n15\n\n\f1 .0 0\n\n2 *2\n3 *3\n4 *4\n\n0 .7 5\n0 .5 0\n0 .2 5\n\n-\u03b3\n\n0 .0 0\n-0 .2 5\n-0 .5 0\n-0 .7 5\n-1 .0 0\n-1 2\n\n-1 0\n\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nJ '/ J\n\nFIG. 9: Topological entanglement entropy vs. J 0 /J for the 2 by 2 block (square), the 3 by 3 block\n(circle) and the 4 by 4 block (triangle) for J-J' model.\n\nfor the 3 by 3 block, and it is beyond our computational capacity. This is the disadvantage\nwhen trying to identify the topological phase with the topological entanglement entropy\nnumerically. Despite that, we still spent months to evaluate the topological entanglement\nentropy for the 4 by 4 block at J 0 /J = \u22126, \u22128 as shown in Fig. 9. The values of these two\ndata points are quite consistent with the ones for the 3 by 3 block. More closely, for the 3\nby 3 block \u03b3 = 0.6248 at J 0 /J = \u22126 and \u03b3 = 0.6057 at J 0 /J = \u22126, and for the 4 by 4 block\n\u03b3 = 0.6276 at J 0 /J = \u22126 and \u03b3 = 0.6111 at J 0 /J = \u22126, respectively.\nOur result shows that \u03b3 is consistent with zero for the non-topological phases (N\u00e9el and\ndimer phases). However, we find that \u03b3 is negative and unphysical in the topological phase\nfor 2 by 2 block. This could be due to the small boundary size effect from the next subleading term of O(L\u2212\u03bd ) with \u03bd > 0. On the other hand, for the 3 by 3 block we expect the\nsmall boundary size effect could be suppressed so that \u03b3 in the topological phase should be\npositive. We find that this is indeed the case, and this is also confirmed by the two data\npoints for the 4 by 4 block. In Fig. 9, there is a long crossover for \u03b3 as we vary J 0 /J between\n0 and \u22125. Then, \u03b3 approaches 0.6 around J 0 /J = \u22125 and then remains at that value for\nmore negative J 0 /J as expected from its topological nature. Naively, we expect a quantum\ncritical point separating topological and non-topological phase, and the crossover could be\ndue to the short range entanglement in our TPS solution. We expect that it should be\nremoved by suitable quantum state renormalization.\n16\n\n\fThough our result is subjected to the errors from the small size effect and also from the\napproximation in our numerical method of Iterative Projection and TRG, it does indicate\na nonzero \u03b3 and thus a topological phase in the regime with J 0 /J < \u22120.54. We may expect\nthe value of \u03b3 will be improved if the above errors could be reduced.\n\nB.\n\nToric code like state\n\nDue to the limitation of our computation power, it is hard to evaluate the topological\nentanglement entropy to high precision by increasing the bond dimension \u03c7 in the TPS\nansatz for the J-J' model. Instead, we now consider a one-parameter toric code like TPS\nstate proposed in [39] with \u03c7 = 2. In this case we can evaluate the topological entanglement\nentropy more precisely to characterize the topological order, and demonstrate the power of\nTRG method on this issue. Later on, we will compare the topological entanglement entropy\nof this state with the pattern of degenerate singular value spectrum of the same state, and\ndemonstrate that the latter can be also used to characterize the topological order without\ninvoking heavy computation capacity. Though this one-parameter state has no relation\nto the J-J' model, however, it yields the supporting evidence for the connection between\ntopological order and degenerate singular values in the topological phase of the J-J' model,\nand possibly for more other frustrated spin systems.\nThis toy TPS state on the square lattice motivated by the toric code model is characterijkl\nized by the TPS tensor [39] on each vertex in Fig. 10 in the form of T\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\nwith four physical\n\nindices i, j, k, l = 0, 1 and four bond indices \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4 = 0, 1 (i.e., bond dimension \u03c7 = 2).\nIts entries are given by\nijkl\nTijkl\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 g i+j+k+l , if i + j + k + l = 0 mod 2 ,\n=\n\uf8f3\n0,\notherwise.\n\n(8)\n\nThe parameter g is used to tune the property of this state from the topological phase\nto the trivial phase. Note that this state is not solved from any model Hamiltonian but\nis devised on purpose to demonstrate the phase transition between topological and trivial\nphases. For g = 1, it reduces to the ground state of the toric code model with Z2 topological\norder. For g = 0, it reduces to a product state of all zeros, i.e., a zero state. Therefore,\nas we vary g, the state will go through a phase transition, and in [39] it showed that the\n\n17\n\n\fFIG. 10: The toric code is defined on a 2D square lattice.

Then, each vertex (black dot) on\nthe lattice lives a TPS tensor with four physical indices, and four bond indices.

Since this state has only \u03c7 = 2 and thus requires not much computation\npower to carry out the numerical calculation up to high precision. Again, we verify that the\nentanglement entropy obeys the area law. Our result is shown in Fig. 11, and it indicates a\ncrossover around gc ' 0.8 separating the trivial phase with \u03b3 = 0 and the topological phase\nwith \u03b3 = 1. We may observe a sharp jump at gc if we increase the block size, however, it is\nthen beyond our computation capacity.\n\nV.\n\nDEGENERACY OF SINGULAR VALUE SPECTRUM AND TOPOLOGICAL\n\nORDER\n\nIn general, there are some ways of classifying the possible topological phases, however,\nthere is no specific method with consensus in identifying the topological phase of a particular\ndynamical model. Topological entanglement entropy [9, 10] is usually thought to be good\nindex in characterizing the topological order, but it is difficult to evaluate numerically to\nhigh precision due to the limitation of the computation capacity as discussed in the previous\nsection.\nOn the other hand, the degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum has recently implemented to characterize the topological orders for some 2D quantum Hall states [11] and\nsome 1D symmetry protected topological phase [4]. For 2D TPS, it is more easier to consider the singular value spectrum, which is related to the entanglement spectrum in some\nway. Despite there is no rigorous proof on its power of characterizing the 2D topological\norders, for the translationally invariant states the degeneracy of the singular value spectrum\nby itself indicates the existence of the long range entanglement. Recently it is argued that\nthe long range entanglement is the characteristics of the topological order from the point\nof view of the quantum information [4\u20137]. The tensor of the TPS encodes the information\nabout the entanglement for the bi-partitions of the system. The singular value spectrum\nobtained from it weighs different components of quantum correlation between bi-partition\nregions in the ground state wave function. Therefore, if there is a double degeneracy of the\nsingular value spectrum, with the help of the translational invariance it may imply that the\nbi-partitions are almost in the maximally entangled states. It is the long range entanglement\nsince it involves the the collective coherences of the spins on half of the space to be strongly\n19\n\n\fcorrelated with all the spins in the other half.\nBy considering the frustrated regime of the J-J' model, we demonstrate the above picture\nis on the right track to uncover the topological nature of the long range entanglement. It\nneeds more study on both numerical and analytical sides to solidify the above connection.\nFrom our on-going work [36], we find more positive evidences.\n\nA.\n\nSome examples\n\nInstead of providing the proof of the above picture, we give examples. A well-studied one\nis the symmetry-protected Haldane phase, which is described by the Afflect-Kennedy-LiebTasaki (AKLT) state. The AKLT state can be put into the form of the MPS represented by\n\u221a\n\u221a\nthe matrices {Ai } = {\u03c3 z , 2\u03c3 + , \u2212 2\u03c3 \u2212 }. By merging two matrices and then performing\nSVD, we find that the singular values are doubly degenerate. This is also proved in more\nrigorous way in [4]. Since the topological phase is robust again small perturbations, we\nconsider the spin-1 model Hamiltonian\nH=J\n\nX\n\n~i * S\n~i+1 + Uzz (Siz )2 .\nS\n\n(9)\n\ni\n\nAt the large Uzz , there is a trivial phase where all the spins are in the eigenstates of S z . On\nthe other hand, for small Uzz the system is in the gapped Haldane phase, which is related\nto the AKLT state by local unitary transformation. We use the iTEBD method to solve the\nground states in the MPS ansatz and then find the singular value spectrum. We find that\nthe phase transition between Haldane phase and the trivial phase is characterized by the\ndegeneracy of the singular value (entanglement) spectrum.\nThe relation between the degeneracy of the singular value spectrum and the topological\norder for the 2D spin system is less explored. Here we consider the simplest Z2 toric code\nijkl\nmodel [16], and the explicit TPS form of its ground state is represented by the tensor T\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4,Z\n2\n\nas discussed in the previous section. We can find the singular value spectrum by merging\nthe tensors and then performing SVD. Again, we find that four kinds of the singular value\nspectrum are all two-fold degenerate.\n\n20\n\n\fB.\n\nTopological order of J-J' model by singular value spectrum and its robustness\n\nThe singular value spectrum for each bond in the J-J' model from the TPS of our numerical ground state solution is given in Fig. 12(a). Each small circle with a middle bar\nrepresents a specific singular value of the singular value spectrum. Note that the singular\nvalue spectrum for the J- and J 0 -bond may show different degeneracy patterns, however,\nif the patterns are similar we will only show one of them. We see that the singular values\nare doubly degenerate for the regime J 0 /J > \u22120.54 in which the N\u00e9el order also vanishes. Therefore, J 0 /J = \u22120.54 should be the critical point separating the topological and\nnon-topological phases, along with the evidence of nonzero topological entanglement entropy discussed previously. On the other hand, for the dimmer phase in the regime with\nJ 0 /J > 2.56, we find the singular values for the J 0 -bond are doubly degenerate, but others\naren't. This reflects the peculiar feature of the strong dimmer bond but not the topological\norder because the topologically entanglement entropy is zero in this phase. Moreover, our\nresults show that not just the dominant singular value but almost all the singular values for\nthat bond are also doubly degenerate.\nRecall that the precision for the topological entanglement entropy and the sharp quantum transition point is hard to achieve due to the limitation on the computation capacity.\nHowever, with the same capacity we can obtain the degenerate singular value spectrum quite\neasily with a sharp quantum transition point. In contrast with the topological entanglement\nentropy, this is the advantage to use the degenerate singular value spectrum to characterize\nthe topological order numerically with TPS ansatz.\nSince the topological order should be robust against the local perturbations, the degeneracy of the singular value spectrum should also does so if it can be used to characterize\nthe topological orders. We first add a random perturbation Hrand at each step of Iterative\nProjection method, where the random 2-body Hamiltonian Hrand is a real symmetric matrix\nwith 10 independent matrix elements given by the random numbers in the interval [0, 0.1J].\nThe result is shown in Fig. 12(b). We see that the singular value spectrum is changed\nbut the pattern of its degeneracy remains intact. This demonstrates the robustness of the\ndegeneracy of the singular value spectrum, and thus the robustness of the topological order.\nP\nz\nTo further check the robustness, we add a perturbation of the form h i,j Si,j\nwhich\nbreaks the spin SO(3) symmetry and the time-reversal symmetry.

The double degeneracy of\nthe singular values is denoted by the two closely touched neighboring circles. Our results show that\nalmost all the singular values are doubly degenerate. (b) Singular value spectrum of the J-J' model\nsubjected to the random perturbation at each step of Iterative Projection method. We see that\nthe pattern of singular spectrum changes but the its double degeneracy in the frustrated regime\nremains.\n\nperturbation does not destroy the double degeneracy of the singular value spectrum. Once\nh is larger than the critical value 1.2, the double degeneracy will be lost. The results for\nh = 0.1 and h = 1.2 are shown in Fig. 13(a) and (b), respectively. On the other hand, in Fig.\nP\n~i,j * S\n~i,j+1 which\n13(c) we show the result by adding a perturbation of the form t i,j (\u22121)j S\nbreaks the translational symmetry in the direction perpendicular to the dimers. Again, we\nsee that the perturbation with t = 0.1 cannot destroy the double degeneracy.\nWith above generic types of perturbations, we see that the degeneracy pattern of the\nsingular value spectrum is quite robust, this reflects the topological nature of the phase.\n\nC.\n\nRemove short range entanglement\n\nAs described previously, quantum state renormalization consists of two steps: the first\nstep is to optimize the local unitary transformation to remove the short range entanglement,\n\n22\n\n\fh=1.2\n\nh=0.1\n\nt=0.1\n\n1\n0.5\n\n0.5\n0.01\n\n0.01\n\n0.01\n\n1E-4\n\n\u03bb\u03b1\n\n\u03bb\u03b1\n\n\u03bb\u03b1\n\n1E-5\n1E-4\n\n1E-8\n1E-11\n\n1E-6\n\n1E-6\n1E-14\n\n(A)\n\n(B)\n\n(C)\n\n1E-8\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\nJ'/J\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n(A)\n\n(B)\n\n1E-16\n4\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\nJ'/J\n\n(a)\n\n2\n\n(C)\n\n4\n\n(b)\n\n(A)\n\n(B)\n\n1E-8\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n(C)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nJ'/J (c)\n\nP\nz with (a)\nFIG. 13: Singular value spectrum \u03bb\u03b1 per bond of the J-J' model perturbed by h i,j Si,j\nP\n~i,j * S\n~i,j+1 with t = 0.1. If\nh = 0.1, (b) h=1.2 (critical value), and (c) perturbed by t i,j (\u22121)j S\nthe perturbation is too large such as in the case (b), the degeneracy will then be lifted. These\nperturbations break various symmetries of the original J-J's model. Despite that, the double\ndegeneracy of the singular spectrum remains. This demonstrates that the degeneracy pattern\nof the singular value spectrum is robust even under the symmetry-breaking perturbations. This\nfeature is different from the 1D symmetry-protected topological order.\n\nand the second step is to coarse grain the site tensors according to the TRG like method\nwhile keeping the physical bonds. After successive steps of quantum state renormalization,\nthe TPS will flow to a fixed point with most of short range entanglement being removed.\nTherefore, one would expect the fixed-point TPS will be the representative of the universal\nclass of topologically ordered states. This quantum informational way of classifying the\ntopological orders are recently proposed in [4\u20137, 39].\nWe then would like to study how the singular value spectrum evolves under the quantum\nstate renormalization group (RG) flow procedure. Since we conjecture that the degeneracy\npattern of the singular value spectrum encodes the long range entanglement, we would expect\nit is robust under the quantum state renormalization, which only removes the short range\nentanglement. This is indeed the case for the J-J' model and the result is shown in Fig.\n14. Moreover, we see that under the quantum state RG flow, the number of the dominant\nsingular values decreases in the topological phase. We can think of the extreme case that\nthere is only one dominant doubly degenerate singular value with all others being suppressed,\nthen the whole lattice is in the GHZ state, i.e., maximal long range entanglement. So, the\n23\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\fsuppression of the singular values except the dominant ones corresponds to the removal\nof the short range entanglement under the quantum state RG flow, and the long range\nentanglement will be encoded in the degeneracy of the dominant singular values of the\nfixed-point TPS.\nRG step=7\n\nRG step=3\n\nRG step=1\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.01\n\n0.01\n\n0.01\n\n\u03bb\u03b1\n\n\u03bb\u03b1\n\n\u03bb\u03b1\n\n1E-5\n\n1E-5\n\n1E-5\n\n1E-8\n\n1E-8\n\n1E-8\n\n1E-10\n\n1E-10\n\n1E-10\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0 J'/J 2\n\n(a)\n\n4\n\n6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\nJ'/J\n\n2\n\n(b) 4\n\n6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\nJ'/J\n\n2\n\n(c) 4\n\nFIG. 14: The singular value spectrum of J-J' model under quantum state RG flow. The number\nof the RG steps is labelled accordingly. In (a), only one step of quantum state RG is performed,\nwhich is not much different from (b) where three steps of RG is done. However, when seven step\nof RG is performed as in (c), a gap between dominant and sub-dominant singular values develops.\nThis gapped pattern remains the same even more RG steps are performed. This implies that a RG\nfixed point with long range entanglement dominated is reached. The gap also indicates that the\nshort range entanglement is removed by the local operations of quantum state RG.\n\nFinally, to get more supporting evidences about the topological nature of the singular\nvalue spectrum under quantum state RG flow, we consider the case for the toric code like TPS\nstate (8) discussed before. To draw a parallel comparison with the topological entanglement\nentropy presented in Fig. 11, we evaluate the difference between the two largest singular\nvalues, denoted as |\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb2 |. The result is shown in Fig. 15.\nFrom Fig. 15, we see that before quantum state renormalization, it seems there is no\ndegenerate singular value spectrum except at g = 1. Moreover, the degeneracy at g = 1\nis 2-fold, which may reflect the underlying Z2 symmetry apart from the long range entanglement. This is in sharp contrast to the crossover behavior of topological entanglement\nentropy around g ' 0.8 as shown in Fig. 11. However, after one step of quantum state\n24\n\n6\n\n\frenormalization, we obtain the crossover similar to the one for topological entanglement\nentropy. As we perform more steps of quantum state renormalization, the crossover become\nsharper and sharper around gc = 0.8. It finally approaches to a sharp quantum critical point\nseparating the topological phase (g > gc ) from the non-topological one (g < gc ). Similar\nbehavior for some scale invariant quantity of the same state (8) under quantum state RG\nflow is also found in [39].\n\n1 .0\n0 .8\n\n\u03bb1\u2212\u03bb2\n\n0 .6\n0 .4\nR G\nR G\n\n0 .2\n\nR G\nR G\n\ns te\ns te\ns te\ns te\n\np = 0\np = 1\np = 5\np = 1 5\n\n0 .0\n0 .0\n\nFIG. 15:\n\n0 .2\n\n0 .4\n\ng\n\n0 .6\n\n0 .8\n\n1 .0\n\nThe difference between the two largest singular values of toric code like model as a\n\nfunction of g under the renormalization flow.\n\nMoreover, we can get some lesson as follows. Though the degeneracy of the singular value\nspectrum may indicate the existence of the long range entanglement, the reverse statement\nmay not be true due to the contamination of the short range entanglement. However, the\nhidden long range entanglement and the underlying symmetry such as Z2 for the toric code\nground state will emerge under the quantum state RG flow as shown in Fig. 15. This is\nconsistent with the robustness check for the topological order of toric code done in [40].\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper, we identify a new topological phase for the J-J' model by explicitly calculating the phase diagram of order parameters, topological entanglement entropy and the\n25\n\n\fdegeneracy of the singular value spectrum. This result demonstrates that the recent quantum information inspired methods such as TPS, Iterative Projection method and TRG are\npowerful enough in tackling the frustrated spin systems and identifying the topological orders. Especially, we demonstrate that the concepts of short range entanglement and long\nrange entanglement introduced in [5, 6] are very useful in providing intuitive picture for the\nentangled nature of topological order. It is also helpful in interpreting the numerical results\nbased on TPS ansatz.\nWe have also found an intriguing connection between the degeneracy of the singular value\nspectrum and topological order by explicitly solving the J-J's model as a nontrivial example.\nThe topological order may not always reflect in the degeneracy of the singular value spectrum\ndue to the disturbing short range entanglement. However, as we show explicitly, we can\nremove short range entanglement by quantum state renormalization so that the degeneracy\nof the singular value spectrum after quantum state renormalization indicates the topological\norder. The implication of such a connection is far-reaching in numerical identification of\nthe topological phase in 2D systems since the computation power of obtaining the singular\nvalue spectrum is far less than the one of evaluating the topological entanglement entropy.\nBased on our observation, we believe that we can use the degeneracy of the singular\nvalue spectrum based on TPS ansatz to identify the topological phases of other interesting\nfrustrated 2D systems. We will report more works along this direction in the near future.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank H.Y. Chen, Z. C. Gu and A. Sandvik for helpful discussions.
