In recent years, diffusion processes on social networks have\nbeen the focus of intense study. While traditionally such processes have been\nof major interest in epidemiology where they model the spread of diseases and\nimmunization [Mor04, Lig85, Lig99, Dur88, BBCS05, DJ06], much of the recent interest has resulted from applications in sociology, economics, and engineering [BR87, ARLV01, GLM01b, GLM01a, DR01, RD02, KKT03, KKT05].\nIn computer science, a strong motivation for analyzing diffusion processes\nhas recently emanated from the study of viral marketing strategies in data mining,\nwhere various novel algorithmic problems have been considered [DR01, RD02,\nKKT03, KKT05]. Roughly speaking, viral marketing-unlike conventional mar2\n\n\fketing-takes into account the \"network value\" of potential customers, that is, it\nseeks to target a set of individuals whose influence on their social network through\nword-of-mouth effects is high.\nCommonly-used heuristics to identify influential nodes in social networks include picking individuals of high degree-so-called degree centrality heuristics-\nor picking individuals with short average distance to the rest of the network-socalled distance centrality heuristics [WF94]. Typically these heuristics provide\nno guarantees. Here we prove a structural conjecture of Kempe, Kleinberg, and\nTardos (KKT) [KKT03, KKT05] which in turn implies that a natural greedy algorithm has a good performance guarantee. The conjecture can be roughly stated\nas follows: if a diffusion model is locally submodular, that is, the influence on an\nindividual by its neighbors in the network has \"diminishing returns,\" then the process is globally submodular (on average). This is relevant in this context because,\nunder the submodularity property, optimization problems-such as the viral marketing problem-are known to have good approximation algorithms [NW88]. In\nparticular, in [KKT03], greedy algorithms based on the above conjecture were\nshown to achieve significantly better performances in practice than widely-used\nnetwork analysis heuristics.\nGeneral Threshold Model. In [KKT03], KKT introduced the general threshold model, a broad generalization of a variety of natural diffusion models on networks, including the influential linear threshold model of Granovetter in sociology [Gra78]. Given an initial set of infected or active individuals on a network,\nthe process grows in the following way. (See Section 1.1 for a formal description.)\n3\n\n\fEach individual, say v, has an activation function, which measures the effect of its\nneighbors on v, as well as a threshold value. At any time, if the set of previously\ninfected neighbors of v is such that its activation function crosses its threshold\nvalue, then v becomes infected. This process is progressive-an active node stays\nactive forever. KKT consider the following natural assumptions:\n- The threshold values are random. This is to account for our lack of knowledge of the exact threshold values. KKT actually assume that the thresholds\nare uniformly random. Note however that, given that any distribution can be\ngenerated from a uniform random variable, it follows that, by appropriately\nmodifying the activation functions, the threshold values can effectively have\nany distribution. (See Section 3.)\n- The activation functions are monotone increasing. That is, a node is more\nlikely to become infected if a larger set of its neighbors is infected.\n- The activation functions are submodular. This corresponds to the fact that\nthe marginal effect of each neighbor of v decreases as the set of active nodes\nincreases.\nThe Influence Maximization Problem. Since the diffusion process defined\nabove is increasing, it terminates after a finite number of steps. For a given initial\nset of active nodes S we define \u03c3(S) to be the expected size of the set of active\nnodes at the end of the process. In the Influence Maximization Problem, we aim\nto find a set S of a fixed size maximizing \u03c3(S).\n\n4\n\n\fThe Influence Maximization Problem is a natural problem to consider in the\ncontext of viral marketing. Given a social network, it is desired to find a small\nset of \"target\" individuals so as to maximize the number of customers who will\neventually purchase a product following the effects of \"word-of-mouth\" [DR01,\nRD02]. The same problem may also be of interest in epidemiology where finding\nthe set S of a fixed size maximizing \u03c3(S) is a natural problem both in terms\nof bounding the spread of a disease and in terms of maximizing the effect of\nimmunization.\nIn [KKT03] it was shown that the Influence Maximization Problem is NPhard to approximate within a factor 1 \u2212 1/e + \u03b5 for all \u03b5 > 0 and that the problem\nis in fact n1\u2212\u03b5 hard to approximate without the submodularity condition. (See,\ne.g., [GJ79, ACG+ 99] for background on NP-completeness and hardness of approximation.) On the other hand, it was shown in [KKT05] that for all \u03b5 > 0 it is\npossible to find a set S of fixed size that is a (1 \u2212 1/e \u2212 \u03b5)-approximation of the\nmaximum in random polynomial time if the set function \u03c3 is itself submodular.\nThis leads to the following conjecture.\nConjecture 1 ([KKT03, KKT05]) The function \u03c3 is submodular.\nWhile the result of [KKT03, KKT05] showed that \u03c3 is submodular in special\ncases and related models (see below), the general case was open prior to our work.\nIn this paper we prove Conjecture 1 and extend it to the case where \u03c3(S) is the\nexpected value of any monotone, submodular function of the final active set. This\ngives a (1 \u2212 1/e \u2212 \u03b5)-approximation algorithm for finding a set S of fixed size\n5\n\n\fmaximizing \u03c3(S).\n\n1.1\n\nThe Model\n\nIn this section, we define formally the general threshold model.\nDefinition 1 (Social Network) A social network is given by:\n- A ground set V with |V | = n\n- A collection of activation functions F = (fv )v\u2208V , where fv : 2V \u2192 [0, 1] is\na [0, 1]-valued set function on V .\nTypically, we think of V as the individuals of a social network G = (V, E) where\neach fv measures the effect of v's neighbors N (v) on v. In particular fv depends\nonly on neighbors N (v) affecting v, so fv (S) = fv (N (v) \u2229 S) for all S. However,\nthe specification of the graph will not be needed below.\nDefinition 2 (Monotonicity) The function\nf : 2V \u2192 R is monotone if\nfv (S) \u2264 fv (T )\nfor all\nS \u2286 T \u2286 V.\nWe say that a collection F of functions from 2V to R is monotone if all its elements\nare monotone functions.\n\n6\n\n\fDefinition 3 (Submodularity) The function\nf : 2V \u2192 R is submodular if for all S, T \u2286 V\n\nf (S) + f (T ) \u2265 f (S \u2229 T ) + f (S \u222a T ).\n\nWe say that a collection F of functions from 2V to R is submodular if all its\nelements are submodular functions.\nThe monotonicity condition corresponds to the fact that the effect of a larger set\non v is stronger than the effect of a smaller set. The submodularity condition is\nequivalent to the fact that if S \u2286 T and v \u2208 V then:\n\nf (T \u222a {v}) \u2212 f (T ) \u2264 f (S \u222a {v}) \u2212 f (S),\n\nso the effect of each individual is decreasing when the set increases.\nAssumption 1 Throughout, we assume that fv (\u2205) = 0 and that fv is monotone\nand submodular for all v \u2208 V .\nWe will consider the following process, which is often referred to as a \"diffusion\" process in the sociology literature.\nDefinition 4 (Diffusion) For a given F, consider the following process, denoted\nS = (St )n\u22121\nt=0 , started at S \u2286 V :\n1. Associate to each node v an independent random variable \u03b8v uniform in\n[0, 1] ;\n7\n\n\f2. Set S0 = S;\n3. At time t \u2265 1, initialize St = St\u22121 and add to St the set of nodes in V \\ St\u22121\nsuch that fv (St\u22121 ) \u2265 \u03b8v .\nClearly the process stops on or before time n \u2212 1. We denote by QF (S) the\ndistribution of S when started at S and write S \u223c QF (S), where we will drop the\nsubscript when F is clear from the context.\nDefinition 5 (Influence) For a weight function w : 2V \u2192 R+ , we define the\ninfluence \u03c3w (S) of S \u2286 V as\n\n\u03c3w (S) = ES [w(Sn\u22121 )],\n\nwhere ES is the expectation under QF (S).\n\n1.2\n\nPrevious Results\n\nConjecture 1 was previously verified in several special cases and related models.\nLinear Threshold Model [KKT03]. This is the general threshold model with\nfv of the form\nfv (S) =\n\nX\n\nbv,w ,\n\nw\u2208S\n\nfor nonnegative constants bv,w . The proof uses a representation in terms of a\nrelated percolation model. See [KKT03] for details.\n\"Normalized\" Submodular Threshold Model [KKT05]. This is the general threshold model with fv satisfying the so-called \"normalized\" submodularity\n8\n\n\fproperty:\nfv (T \u222a {i}) \u2212 fv (T )\nfv (S \u222a {i}) \u2212 fv (S)\n\u2265\n,\n1 \u2212 fv (S)\n1 \u2212 fv (T )\n\n(1)\n\nfor all S \u2286 T . Note that this is stronger than submodularity. The proof takes\nadvantage of an equivalence with the decreasing cascade model (see below).\nIndependent Cascade Model [KKT03]. This is a related model where each\nedge (v, w) has an associated probability pv,w of being live, independently of all\nother edges. Infected nodes are those connected to the initial set through a live\npath. The proof of Conjecture 1 in this case also uses a percolation argument.\nDecreasing Cascade Model [KKT05]. A natural generalization of the previous model consists in defining for each v, each neighbor w of v and each subset of\nneighbors S of v a success probability pv (w, S) which is the probability that node\nw will succeed in activating v given that nodes in S are active and have failed to\nactivate v. Each node w gets only one chance to activate each of its neighbors.\nKKT impose a natural order-independence condition on the success probabilities,\nthat is, the overall success probability of activating v does not depend on the order in which the active neighbors of v try to activate it. This model-called the\ngeneral cascade model in [KKT03]-turns out to be equivalent to the general\nthreshold model under the maps\n\npv (w, S) =\n\nfv (S \u222a {w}) \u2212 fv (S)\n,\n1 \u2212 fv (S)\n\n9\n\n\fand\nr\nY\nfv (S) = 1 \u2212\n(1 \u2212 pv (wi , Si\u22121 )),\ni=1\n\nwhere S = {w1 , . . . , wr } and Si = {w1 , . . . , wi }. When\n\npv (w, S) \u2265 pv (w, T )\n\n(2)\n\nfor all S \u2286 T and all v, w, the model is called the decreasing cascade model.\nIt is easy to check that the decreasing cascade model is equivalent to (1) under\nthe mapping above. The proof of the conjecture for the decreasing cascade model\nworks by coupling the processes started at S and T with S \u2286 T and then adding\nw in a second phase where condition (2) is used.\nIn [KKT03], it is also shown that these results carry over to the non-progressive\ncase where \u03b8v is resampled independently at each time step and to general marketing strategies where one can use several marketing actions simultaneously. We\nrefer the reader to [KKT03] for details.\nContact Process. A result similar to our Theorem 1 below holds for a related\ncontact process [Har74, Lig85, LSS07], where the infection rates are monotone,\nconcave functions of the number of infected neighbours (a special case of monotone, submodular functions) and where vertices also heal at a constant rate. In\nparticular, Harris [Har74] uses a coupling argument, although it appears that Harris' proof does not extend easily to our setting as it uses the special form of the\ninfection rates.\nSubsequent Work. After the publication of this work in its extended abstract\n10\n\n\fform [MR07], further work was devoted to viral marketing, particularly in the\ncompetitive framework where firms compete for customers [DGM06, CNWvZ07,\nBKS07, EDS07].\n\n1.3\n\nMain Result\n\nTheorem 1 (Main Result) Consider the process defined in Definition 4 where F\nand w are monotone and submodular. Then, \u03c3w is monotone and submodular. In\nparticular, this is true when w is the cardinality function.\nCorollary 1 Consider the process defined in Definition 4 where F and w are\nmonotone and submodular. Furthermore, assume that w takes values between 1\nand poly(n). Then, there exists a (greedy) (1 \u2212 1/e \u2212 1/poly(n))-approximation\nalgorithm for maximizing \u03c3w (S) among all sets S of size k [KKT05] in time\npoly(n). In particular, this is true when w is the cardinality function.\nThe corollary follows from Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 of [KKT05]. KKT's\nGreedy Approximation Algorithm is a simple variant of the standard greedy algorithm where sampling is used to estimate \u03c3w .\nOur proof. Similarly to [KKT05], a natural idea is to run the process in stages.\nHere we use three phases: we first grow A \u2229 B, then A \\ B, and finally B \\ A.\nSee Figure 1 for an illustration. The key difference is in the execution of the last\nphase. To do away with the \"normalized\" submodularity condition of [KKT05],\nwe do the following.\n\n11\n\n\f\u2022 We use a careful combination of cascade and threshold models, which we\ncall the need-to-know representation.\n\u2022 More importantly, we introduce a novel \"antisense\" coupling technique\nbased on the intuition that coupling the processes started at arbitrary sets\nA and B by using \u03b8v and 1 \u2212 \u03b8v respectively, in a way, \"maximizes their\nunion\" (note that 1 \u2212 \u03b8v is also uniform in [0, 1]). This has to be implemented carefully to also control the intersection. See Section 2 for details.\nSee, e.g., [Lin92] for a general reference on the coupling method.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. We begin with a few preliminary remarks in Section 2.1. The need-to-know representation and the antisense\nprocess are introduced in Section 2.2. The full coupling and the proof of its correctness appear in Section 2.3.\nThe results of this paper were announced in the form of an extended abstract\nin [MR07].\n\n2\n\nProof\n\nThroughout we fix F and w monotone, submodular. We also fix two arbitrary sets\nA, B \u2286 V and let C = A \u2229 B and D = A \u222a B. The idea of the proof is to couple\n\n12\n\n\fthe four processes\nA = (At )n\u22121\nt=0 \u223c Q(A),\nn\u22121\nB = (Bt )t=0\n\u223c Q(B),\n\nC = (Ct )n\u22121\nt=0 \u223c Q(C),\nD = (Dt )n\u22121\nt=0 \u223c Q(D),\nin such a way that\nCn\u22121 \u2286 An\u22121 \u2229 Bn\u22121 ,\n\n(3)\n\nDn\u22121 \u2286 An\u22121 \u222a Bn\u22121 .\n\n(4)\n\nand\n\nIndeed, we then have the following lemma.\nLemma 1 Suppose there exists a coupling of A, B, C and D satisfying (3), (4).\nThen\n\u03c3w (A) + \u03c3w (B) \u2265 \u03c3w (A \u2229 B) + \u03c3w (A \u222a B).\n\n(5)\n\nProof: We have by monotonicity and submodularity of w\n\nw(An\u22121 ) + w(Bn\u22121 )\n\u2265 w(An\u22121 \u2229 Bn\u22121 ) + w(An\u22121 \u222a Bn\u22121 )\n\u2265 w(Cn\u22121 ) + w(Dn\u22121 ),\n\nand therefore, taking expectations we get (5). \u0004\nOur coupling is based on the following ideas:\n13\n\n(6)\n\n\f- Antisense coupling. The obvious coupling is to use the same \u03b8v 's for all\nprocesses. It is easy to see that such a coupling does not satisfy (4). It does\nhowever satisfy (3). Intuitively, using the same \u03b8v for A and B \"maximizes\ntheir intersection\" while using \u03b8v for A and (1 \u2212 \u03b8v ) for B \"maximizes\ntheir union.\" We call this last coupling the antisense coupling. To dominate\nboth the intersection and the union simultaneously, we combine these two\ncouplings.\n- Piecemeal growth. The growth of the four processes can be divided in\nseveral stages where we add the initial sets progressively. Roughly, the\ncoupling below starts by growing A \u2229 B, then A \\ B and finally B \\ A.\nFollowing our previous comment, the last phase uses the antisense coupling\nto allow the process B to dominate D in that phase.\n- Need-to-know representation. Finally, to help carry out the previous remarks, we note that it is not necessary to pick the \u03b8v 's at the beginning of the\nprocess. Instead, at each step, we uncover as little information as possible\nabout \u03b8v . This is related to the cascade model of [KKT05] although here we\nuse an explicit combination of cascade and threshold models.\nWe explain these ideas next. The proof of Theorem 1 follows in Section 2.3.\n\n2.1\n\nPiecemeal growth\n\nWe first describe an equivalent representation of the process where the initial set\nis added in stages. We denote by Q(S | \u03b8) the process Q(S) conditioned on \u03b8 =\n14\n\n\f(\u03b8v )v\u2208V . For a partition S (1) , . . . , S (K) of S (we allow some of the S (k) 's to be\nempty), consider the process\n\n\u223c Q(S (1) , . . . , S (K) ),\nT = (Tt )Kn\u22121\nt=0\n\nwhere\n1. For each v \u2208 V pick \u03b8v uniformly and independently in [0, 1] and set T\u22121 =\n\u2205;\n2. For 1 \u2264 k \u2264 K, we set\n\nkn\u22121\n(Tt )t=(k\u22121)n\n\u223c Q(T(k\u22121)n\u22121 \u222a S (k) | \u03b8);\n\nin other words, we add the S (k) 's one at a time and use the same \u03b8v 's for all\nstages.\nThe outcomes of the processes Q(S) and Q(S (1) , . . . , S (K) ) have the same distribution. This result actually follows from a more general discussion in [KKT05],\nbut we give a proof here for completeness.\nLemma 2 (Piecemeal Growth) Let S (1) , . . . , S (K) be a partition of S \u2286 V . Let\n\nn\u22121\nS = (St )t=0\n\u223c Q(S),\n\nand\nT = (Tt )Kn\u22121\n\u223c Q(S (1) , . . . , S (K) ).\nt=0\n15\n\n\fThen Sn\u22121 and TKn\u22121 have the same distribution.\nProof: Pick \u03b8v uniformly and independently in [0, 1] for each v \u2208 V and let\nn\u22121\nS = (St )t=0\n\u223c Q(S | \u03b8),\n\nand\nKn\u22121\n\u223c Q(S (1) , . . . , S (K) | \u03b8).\nT = (Tt )t=0\n\nMoreover, let\nT0 = (Tt0 )Kn\u22121\n\u223c Q(S, \u2205, . . . , \u2205 | \u03b8),\nt=0\nand\nT00 = (Tt00 )Kn\u22121\n\u223c Q(\u2205, . . . , \u2205, S | \u03b8).\nt=0\nBy monotonicity and induction on the K stages,\n\n00\n0\nTKn\u22121\n\u2286 TKn\u22121 \u2286 TKn\u22121\n\nBut clearly\n0\n00\nTKn\u22121\n= TKn\u22121\n= Sn\u22121\n\nso that Sn\u22121 = TKn\u22121 . \u0004\n\n16\n\n\f2.2\n\nAntisense phase and need-to-know representation\n\nTo implement the antisense coupling, we define the following variant of the process.\nDefinition 6 Let S (1) , . . . , S (K) be a partition of S and let T \u2286 V \\ S. We define\nthe process\n(K+1)n\u22121\n\nT = (Tt )t=0\n\n\u223c Q\u2212 (S (1) , . . . , S (K) ; T ),\n\nwhere\n1. For each v \u2208 V pick \u03b8v uniformly in [0, 1];\nKn\u22121\n2.

At time Kn + 1 \u2264 t \u2264 (K + 1)n \u2212 1, initialize Tt = Tt\u22121 , and add to Tt the\nset of nodes in V \\ Tt\u22121 such that\n\nfv (Tt\u22121 ) \u2212 fv (TKn\u22121 ) \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03b8v .\n\nLemma 3 (Antisense Phase) Assume S (1) , . . . , S (K) is a partition of S and T \u2286\nV \\ S. Let\n(K+1)n\u22121\n\nS = (St )t=0\n\n\u223c Q(S (1) , . . . , S (K) , T ),\n\nand\n(K+1)n\u22121\n\nT = (Tt )t=0\n\n\u223c Q\u2212 (S (1) , . . . , S (K) ; T ).\n17\n\n\fThen, S(K+1)n\u22121 and T(K+1)n\u22121 have the same distribution.\nProof: As was discussed at the beginning of Section 2, rather than picking the \u03b8v 's\nat the beginning of the process, it is useful to think of them as being progressively\nuncovered on a need-to-know basis. Consider only the first stage of the process\nS for the time being. Let S\u22121 = \u2205. Suppose that, at time t \u2265 1, v \u2208\n/ St\u22121 . Then\nwe have that \u03b8v \u2208 [fv (St\u22122 ), 1] and all we need to know to decide if v is added to\nSt is whether or not \u03b8v \u2208 [fv (St\u22122 ), fv (St\u22121 )]. In other words, was the increase\nin fv between time t \u2212 2 and t \u2212 1 enough to hit \u03b8v ? Note that, given the event\n{fv (St\u22122 ) \u2264 \u03b8v }, \u03b8v is uniformly distributed in [fv (St\u22122 ), 1] and we have that \u03b8v\nis in [fv (St\u22122 ), fv (St\u22121 )] with probability\nfv (St\u22121 ) \u2212 fv (St\u22122 )\n.\n1 \u2212 fv (St\u22122 )\nTherefore, we can describe the process (St )n\u22121\nt=0 equivalently as follows. We first\nset S\u22121 = \u2205, S0 = S. Then, at step 1 \u2264 t \u2264 n \u2212 1, we initialize St = St\u22121 and for\neach v \u2208 V \\ St\u22121 :\n- With probability\nfv (St\u22121 ) \u2212 fv (St\u22122 )\n,\n1 \u2212 fv (St\u22122 )\nwe add v to St and pick \u03b8v uniformly in\n\n[fv (St\u22122 ), fv (St\u22121 )];\n\n- Otherwise, we do nothing.\n18\n\n(7)\n\n\fBy the discussion above, this new version of the process has the same distribution\nas Q(S (1) ). We proceed similarly for the following K \u2212 1 stages to get (St )Kn\u22121\nt=0\nwhich is then distributed according to Q(S (1) , . . . , S (K) ).\nUp to time Kn \u2212 1, the processes (St ) and (Tt ) have identical transition probabilities. Hence, we can take\n\n(Tt )Kn\u22121\n= (St )Kn\u22121\nt=0\nt=0 .\n\nThen note that, at time t = Kn, for each v \u2208\n/ SKn\u22121 = TKn\u22121 , we have that \u03b8v is\nuniformly distributed in\n\n[fv (SKn\u22121 ), 1] = [fv (TKn\u22121 ), 1].\n\nFor each such v, we now pick \u03b8v uniformly in [fv (SKn\u22121 ), 1]. Moreover, we define\nfor all v \u2208 V\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u03b8v ,\n0\n\u03b8v =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 f (S\nv\n\nv \u2208 SKn\u22121 ,\n\nKn\u22121 )\n\n+ 1 \u2212 \u03b8v , v \u2208\n/ SKn\u22121 .\n\nFinally, let\n(K+1)n\u22121\n\n\u223c Q(SKn\u22121 \u222a T | \u03b8),\n\n(K+1)n\u22121\n\n\u223c Q(TKn\u22121 \u222a T | \u03b80 ).\n\n(St )t=Kn\nand\n(Tt )t=Kn\n\nThat is, we run the last stage of S and T as before, with \u03b8 and \u03b80 respectively.\nIt is clear that T \u223c Q\u2212 (S (1) , . . . , S (K) ; T ) by construction. Moreover, it follows\n19\n\n\fthat S(K+1)n\u22121 and T(K+1)n\u22121 have the same distribution from the fact that for a\nuniform variable \u03b8v in [fv (SKn\u22121 ), 1], the random variables \u03b8v and fv (SKn\u22121 ) +\n1 \u2212 \u03b8v have the same distribution. \u0004\n\n2.3\n\nCoupling\n\nWe are now ready to prove Theorem 1. We will need the following easy consequence of monotone submodularity.\nLemma 4 Let f : 2V \u2192 R+ be monotone and submodular. Then if S \u2286 S 0 \u2286 V\nand T \u2286 T 0 \u2286 V , we have\n\nf (S \u222a T 0 ) \u2212 f (S) \u2265 f (S 0 \u222a T ) \u2212 f (S 0 ).\n\nProof: Note that by monotonicity and submodularity\n\nf (S \u222a T 0 ) \u2212 f (S) \u2265 f (S \u222a T ) \u2212 f (S) = f (S \u222a (T \\ S)) \u2212 f (S)\n\u2265 f (S \u222a (S 0 \\ (T \u222a S)) \u222a (T \\ S)) \u2212 f (S \u222a (S 0 \\ (T \u222a S)))\n\u2265 f (S 0 \u222a T ) \u2212 f (S 0 ).\n\n\u0004\nWe now give a proof of Theorem 1.\n\n20\n\n\fProof: We proceed with our coupling of A, B, C, and D.

It is easy to see that the submodularity assumption in Theorem 1 is\nnecessary in the following sense: Any function f which is not submodular admits a network with activation function f where the influence is not submodular.\n\n24\n\n\fIndeed, let f : 2V \u2192 R+ , A, B \u2286 V such that\n\nf (A) + f (B) < f (A \u2229 B) + f (A \u222a B).\n\nLet V \u2217 = V \u222a {v \u2217 } with fv\u2217 \u2261 f and fv \u2261 1 for all v \u2208 V . It is then immediate\nto check that:\n\n\u03c3(A) + \u03c3(B) = |A| + |B| + f (A) + f (B)\n= |A \u2229 B| + |A \u222a B|\n+f (A) + f (B)\n< |A \u2229 B| + |A \u222a B|\n+f (A \u2229 B) + f (A \u222a B)\n= \u03c3(A \u2229 B) + \u03c3(A \u222a B).\n\nOther threshold distributions. As noted in the introduction, our results hold for\ngeneral threshold distributions. Assume that \u03b8v has cumulative distribution Fv .\nNotice that the dynamics can be re-written as\n\nfv (St\u22121 ) \u2265 \u03b8v \u2261 Fv\u22121 (Uv )\n\n\u21d4\n\nFv (fv (St\u22121 )) \u2265 Uv ,\n\nwhere the Uv 's are independent uniform in [0, 1]. Hence, if Fv \u25e6 fv is increasing\nsubmodular for all v then the influence function is submodular. Furthermore, the\nexample above demontrates that this condition is necessary.\n\n25\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nWe thank Jon Kleinberg and \u00c9va Tardos for insightful discussions and encouragements.
