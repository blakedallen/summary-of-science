The experimental results proved the previously theoretical prediction and are in\nreasonable agreement with the calculation based on semiclassical theory involving the\nphase fluctuation of pump laser.\n\nOCIS codes: 270.0270, 190.4410.\n1\n\n\fOptical parametric oscillators both degenerate (DOPO) and nondegenerate (NOPO) have\nbeen one of the most important entanglement sources in the quantum information of continuous\nvariables (CV) [1]. As a useful tool in quantum optics for the generation of nonclassical states of\nlight, the quantum fluctuation characteristics of the output fields from OPO has been extensively\nstudied since the late 1980s. Firstly M. D. Reid and P. D. Drummond theoretically predicted that\nthe signal and idler optical modes produced from NOPO operating above or below the oscillation\nthreshold are in an entanglement state with the quantum correlation of amplitude and phase\nquadratures [2-5]. In 1992, the CV entanglement of optical modes was experimentally\ndemonstrated by Z. Y. Ou et al. with an NOPO below threshold [6]. Although the quantum\ncorrelation of amplitude quadratures between intense signal and idler from above-threshold\nNOPO (named twin beams) was measured experimentally and effectively applied by several\ngroups [7-12], the phase correlation of the twin beams with nondegenerate frequencies was not\nobserved for a long time. For measuring the phase correlation of twin beams using general\nhomodyning detector, Laurat et al. forced the NOPO to oscillate in a strict frequency-degenerate\nsituation by inserting a \u03bb/4 plate inside the NOPO and observed a 3 dB phase-sum variance\nabove the shot-noise-limit (SNL) [13]. Then, in 2005 CV entanglement of frequencynondegenerate twin beams was experimentally measured by two groups with scanning a pair of\ntunable ring analysis cavities [14] or with two sets of unbalanced Match-Zehnder (M-Z)\ninterferometers [15], respectively. In 2006 the entangled twin beams with stable frequency\ndifference was obtained by Pfister's group [16]. However, those experimentally measured phasecorrelations were always smaller than that of the theoretical prediction. At the end of 1980s,\nFabre et al. presented the expressions for calculating quantum correlations of amplitude and\nphase quadratures between twin beams [17], in which the pump laser was regarded as an ideal\n\n2\n\n\fcoherent state thus the influence of the pump excess phase noise on entanglement of twin beams\nwas not considered. In the Fig. 3 of Ref. [15] achieved by our group before, we compared the\nnormalized noise power spectra of the intensity-difference and the phase-sum calculated from the\nexpressions given in Ref. [17] and the experimentally measured values, which showed that the\nmeasured value of the intensity-difference perfectly agreed with that calculated theoretically but\nthe measured phase correlation noise was higher by 0.08 than the calculated values. Earlier, Reid\nand Drummond theoretically proved that a correlation between signal and idler phase diffusion\nexisted and hence that the sum-phase fluctuations are not affected by this noise [4]. To explain\nwhy the experimentally measured phase-correlation of twin beams were always less than the\ntheoretical values, the effect of the excess phase noise of the pump laser was considered in the\ntheoretical calculations recently [18-21]. All calculations show that the excess phase noise of the\npump laser will reduce the phase-correlation of twin beams and no more effect to the intensitycorrelation. So far, to the best of our knowledge there is no experimental demonstration on this\neffect. In this paper we present the first experimental study on the effect of the pump excess\nphase noise to the phase-correlation of twin beams. For directly comparing with theory, we\nderived a formula of the intensity-difference (Sp) and the phase-sum (Sq) noise spectra between\noutput signal and idler of NOPO with the semiclassical method used in Ref. [17], but in our\ncalculation the excess phase noise of the pump laser, E (\u03c9), is involved:\nTT \u2032\nT \u2032 + \u03c9 2\u03c4 2\n\n(1)\n\nTT \u2032\n2TT \u2032(\u03c3 \u2212 1)\n+\u03b7\u2032 2 2\nE\n2\n2 2\nT\u2032 \u03c3 +\u03c9 \u03c4\nT \u2032 \u03c3 + \u03c9 2\u03c4 2\n\n(2)\n\nS p (\u03c9 ) = 1 \u2212 \u03b7\n\nS q (\u03c9 ) = 1 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n\fwhere \u03b7 and \u03b7/ are the transmission efficiency for the intensity and phase correlation\nmeasurement, respectively; T/=T+\u03b4, T is the transmission coefficient of the output mirror of the\nNOPO and\u03b4 is the extra intracavity loss in the NOPO; \u03c3=(P/P0)1/2 is the pump parameter (P-\nthe pump power, P0 - the threshold pump power of the NOPO); \u03c9 is the analysis circular\nfrequency in the range of radio frequency (rf); \u03c4 is the round trip flying time of photons in the\noptical cavity. The detailed theoretical analyses on this subject will be presented in another\npublication which is being prepared. The Eqs. (1) and (2) were deduced under the condition of\nthat the finesse of the NOPO cavity for the pump laser is much smaller than the finesse for the\nsignal and idler beams as that used in Ref. [17].\nThe measurement scheme and principle of the phase fluctuation using an unbalanced MZ interferometer are the same as that presented by Gl\u00f6ckl et al. originally [22]. According to the\nrequirement in Ref. [22], for measuring the phase fluctuation of the input field of the\ninterferometer the difference in length between the short and the long arms of the unbalanced\ninterferometer (\u25b3L) should equal to c/(2\u03c9n), where \u03c9 is the analysis circular frequency, c is the\nlight velocity in vacuum and n is the refraction index of transmission medium. As that shown in\nEqs. (1) and (2), the quantum fluctuation of the intensity-difference and the phase-sum are\ndecreased when the analysis circular frequency (\u03c9) is lower for a given NOPO. It means that the\nquantum correlation of twin beams is higher at lower analysis frequency. For measuring the\nphase correlation of twin beams at the different analysis frequency conveniently we constructed\na pair of unbalanced fiber M-Z interferometers with totally equivalent elements. The length of\nthe short arm of the interferometers is fixed at 2 m and that of the long arm can be selected\namong 50 m, 21 m and 12 m, which corresponds to the requirement for the analysis frequencies\nof 2 MHz, 5 MHz and 10 MHz, respectively. The refraction index of the fiber equals to 1.55. In\n\n4\n\n\forder to study quantitatively the influence of the pump excess phase noise on the phasecorrelation of twin beams, a phase modulator is placed in the optical path of the pump laser\nbefore NOPO. The given modulation intensity stands for a certain excess white phase noise of\npump laser.\nFig. 1 is the schematic of the unbalanced M-Z fiber interferometer which consists of a\npolarizing-beam-splitter (PBS), two reflection mirrors (M1 and M2), and a 50/50 optical beamsplitter (M3). The short and long fibers with input and output fiber couplers (FC) constitute the\nshort and long arms of the interferometer. The half wave plates HWP1 and HWP2 are used for\naligning the polarization direction of light relative to PBS and that between two arms\nrespectively. The output optical fields from M3 are detected by a balanced detection system\nconsisting of high-efficiency photodiodes (D1 and D2). The sum and difference of the\nphotocurrents detected by D1 and D2 can be achieved with the positive and negative power\ncombiners (+/-), respectively. If aligning the polarization of input light with HWP1 to make total\ninput light only passes through the short fiber, in this case, M3, D1 and D2 play a role of general\nbalanced detector, thus the sum and difference photocurrents give the amplitude noise level and\nthe SNL of the input light, respectively [15, 22]. If splitting the input light equivalently to the\ntwo arms of the interferometer and adjusting the phase difference between the two optical beams\npassing through the short and long arms to \u03c0/2, the difference photocurrent corresponds to the\nphase noise level of the input light and the sum photocurrent stands for the SNL [15, 22]. The\nmeasured losses of both short and long arms are about 22% which mainly come from the losses\nof the fiber couplers. The loss in the fiber can be neglected, thus the losses in two arms are\nalmost equivalent.\n\n5\n\n\fThe experimental system is shown in Fig. 2. The pump laser at 540 nm wavelength is\nproduced from a homemade CV frequency-doubled and frequency-stabilized Nd:YAP/KTP laser\n(Nd:YAP-Nd-dopped YAlO3 perovskite, KTP-polassium titanyl phosphate)[23]. The semimonolithic NOPO consists of an \u03b1-cut type-II phase-matching KTP crystal and an output coupler\nwhich is a concave mirror of 50 mm curvature with high reflectivity at 540 nm and the\ntransmission coefficient of 3.2% at 1080 nm. The front face of KTP is coated to be used as the\ninput coupler of the NOPO with the reflectivity of 39% at 540 nm and high reflectivity at 1080\nnm. The other face is coated with the antireflective film at both wavelengths at 540nm and\n1080nm to reduce the intracavity loss. The output coupler is mounted on a piezoelectric\ntransducer (PZT) for actively locking the cavity length of the NOPO on resonance with the pump\nlaser. The measured cavity finesse for 1080nm is 150, and the total intracavity extra loss is about\n1%. The twin beams with cross-polarized directions are produced in the NOPO through a\nnonlinearly optical process of frequency down-conversion. The output signal and idler beams are\nseparated by the polarizing-beam-splitter (PBS), and then each of them is directed into an\nunbalanced M-Z interferometer (MZI1 and MZI2). The difference and the sum photocurrents are\nanalyzed and recorded by the spectrum analyzer (SA). In the system, three spectrum analyzers\nare used totally, two of them in MZI1 and MZI2 and another one for the final measurements of\nthe photocurrent combinations [15].\nDuring the experiment for all measurements the pump power of the NOPO is kept at 194 mW,\nwhich is 64 mW higher than the oscillation threshold power of ~130 mW. Although the phase\ncorrelation should be better for the pump power close to the threshold according to the\ntheoretical calculation [2,7], we found in experiments that the NOPO with lower finesse of the\npump laser could operate stably only when a higher pump power was used. The highly unstable\n\n6\n\n\foutput from the NOPO was observed when the pump power approached the threshold. We\nbelieve that the reason for these results is that the multiple modes can oscillate simultaneously in\nthe NOPO with low finesse of the pump laser owing to its flat resonance peak, thus mode\ncompetition and mode hoping must induce instability. When the pump power is increased, once\nthe oscillation of a twin beam mode dominates in the NOPO, the output will be stable. Under the\npump power of 194mW the detected output power of the twin beams is about 20 mW.\nIn the experiment, at first the amplitude and phase noise spectra of the signal and idler modes\nare measured by MZI1 and MZI2, respectively. Then, the quantum correlations of twin beams are\ndefined by the noise level of the intensity difference and the phase sum of the photocurrents\nmeasured by the two interferometers. Fig. 3(a), (b) and (c) are the measured quantum correlation\nvariances of the signal and idler beams at 2 MHz, 5 MHz and 10 MHz, respectively, in which\nthree different lengths (50 m, 21 m and 12 m) of the long arms of two interferometers are used\nrespectively to meet the requirement of the phase-correlation measurement at three different\nanalysis frequencies as mentioned before. In the three figures, trace i, v and iv correspond to the\nSNL of the twin beams, the noise powers of the intensity-difference and the phase-sum under the\nsituation without adding excess phase noise on the pump laser, respectively. When excess white\nphase noise of 0.33 or 1.00 (normalized to the original phase noise of the pump laser) is added on\nthe pump laser through a phase-modulator, the phase-correlation noise power increases from iv\nto iii (0.33) or ii (1.00). As that predicted by theory [17-21], the intensity-correlation v is not\neffected by the excess phase noise of the pump laser. All amplitude and phase correlation\nvariances measured at the three analysis frequencies are lower than the SNL even with the excess\npump phase noise of 1.00, thus the quantum entanglement of twin beams experimentally proved.\nHowever, we found in experiment that when the excess pump phase noise was larger than 3.0,\n\n7\n\n\fthe phase-correlation noise power will be higher than the SNL. The critical excess pump phase\nnoise can be calculated from Eq. (2). The results perhaps can explain why the phase-correlation\nof twin beams in some experiments was not observed [13].\nFig. 4 shows the normalized noise power spectra of the intensity-difference and the phasesum of twin beams calculated from Eqs. (1) and (2) by use of the parameters of the real\nexperimental systems(\u03c4=39.5ns, \u03c3=1.39, \u03b7=0.9*0.78 and \u03b7/=0.9*0.78*0.78 coming from the\nfiber coupling efficiency of 78% and the detection efficiency of 90%). Since the input optical\nbeam of MZI passes through two fibers (short and long arms) in the measurement of the phase\nnoise, we have \u03b7/=0.9*0.78*0.78, but it only transmits through the short arm for the\nmeasurement of the intensity-difference, thus \u03b7/=0.9*0.78. Trace i corresponds to the intensitydifference spectrum. Trace ii, iii, iv corresponds to the phase-sum spectra with the pump excess\nnoise E = 0, 0.33, 1.00 respectively. The symbols \u25b2,\u25bc,\u25baand \u25c4 are the experimental\nmeasured values corresponding to the intensity-difference and the phase-sum with E=0, 0.33 and\n1.00, respectively. The experimental analysis frequencies are 2MHz, 5MHz and 10MHz. We can\nsee that the experimental measurements are in reasonable agreement with that theoretically\ncalculated. Still, the experimentally measured values of the phase-sum noise (\u25b2,\u25ba,\u25c4) are a\nlittle higher than that of theory (ii, iii, iv). We consider that is because the possibly spurious\nphase-noise of the pump laser produced inside the NOPO has not been considered in Eq. (2),\nwhich will be studied in our next work.\nIn conclusion, we experimentally demonstrated the dependence of the phase-correlation of\ntwin beams from NOPO operating above threshold on the excess phase noise of the pump laser.\nThe experimental measurements agree with the theoretical predictions resulting from the\nsemiclassical method quite well. The intense frequency-nondegenerate entangled light beams\n\n8\n\n\fprobably are appropriate to be used for quantum key distribution of optical continuous variables\nsince the local oscillations for homodyne detection will not be needed and also for distributing\nquantum information between different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum by means of\nteleportation.\nThis research was supported by the PCSIRT (Grant No. IRT0516), Natural Science\nFoundation of China (Grants No. 60608012, No. 60608012, 60736040 and 10674088).\n\n9\n\n\fReferences without titles\n1.
