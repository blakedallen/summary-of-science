We shall also use the idea of compactification\nof extra dimensions due to Klein [2]. To outline the main idea behind this\nmodel in a very simple way, we can reduce the dimensionality and consider\nthe dynamics of a vector field defined on a 2-cylinder R1 \u00d7 S 1 . For this purpose we can use the velocity field u(x, \u03c4 ) of a two-dimensional flow of ideal\nincompressible fluid moving through this manifold.\nIndeed, the dynamics of the vector field u(x, \u03c4 ) with the initial condition\nu(x, 0) is defined by the evolution equation\nZ Z\n\u03b4\ndx \u2227 u(x, \u03c4 )d\u03c4 \u2192 0,\n(1.1)\n\u2206\u03c4\n\n\u2206x\n\nwhere we use the restriction of the vector field onto an arbitrary cylinder's\nelement; \u2206\u03c4 is the evolution (time) interval, and \u2206x is an arbitrary segment\n1\n\n\fof the cylinder's element. In other words, we assume the variation of the\nintegral of the mass carried by the flow through the segment during a finite\ntime interval to be vanishing. That is, as a result of the field evolution,\nu(x, 0) \u2192 u(x, \u221e), the functional of the flow mass approaches to its maximal\nvalue. If, at the initial moment of time, the regular vector field u(x, 0)\ncorresponds to a unit vector forming an angle \u03c6 with the cylinder's element,\nthen the evolution of this field is described by the equation\nZ Z\nZ Z\n\u03b4\ndx \u2227 u(x, \u03c4 )d\u03c4 = \u03b4\nsin \u03c6(\u03c4 )dxd\u03c4 = cos \u03c6(\u03c4 )\u2206\u03c4 \u2206x \u2192 0.\n\u2206\u03c4\n\n\u2206x\n\n\u2206\u03c4\n\n\u2206x\n\n(1.2)\nTherefore, the case of \u03c6(0) = 0 corresponds to the absolute instability of the\nvector field. During its evolution, u(x, 0) \u2192 u(x, \u221e), the field is relatively\nstable at 0 < \u03c6(\u03c4 ) < \u03c0/2, achieving the absolute stability at the end of this\nevolution, when \u03c6(\u221e) = \u03c0/2. If, additionally, we fix the vector field u(x, \u03c4 )\nat the endpoints of the segment \u2206x by imposing some boundary conditions\non the evolution equation 1.1, we would get the following dynamical equation:\nZ Z\n\u03b4\ndx \u2227 u(x, t)d\u03c4 = 0.\n(1.3)\n\u2206\u03c4\n\n\u2206x\n\nLet some flow lines of the vector field u(x, \u03c4 ) be degenerated into circles\n(topological features) as a result of the absolute instability of the field and\nfluctuations during the initial phase of its evolution. Since the dynamics\nof such topological features is described by 1.3, the features would tend to\nmove towards that side of \u2206x where the field u(x, \u03c4 ) is more stable. Thus,\nthe topological features serve as attraction points for each other and can be\nused for modelling matter particles (mass points).\nWe must emphasise that the plane (x, \u03c4 ), in which our variational equations are defined, has the Euclidean metric. That is, in the case of the Euclidean plane (x, \u03c6) wrapping over a cylinder we can identify the azimuthal\nparameter \u03c6 with the evolution parameter \u03c4 . By choosing the observer's\nworldline coinciding with a cylinder's element we can speak of a classical\nlimit, whereas by generalising and involving also the azimuthal (angular)\nparameter we can speak of the quantisation of our model. So, when the\nobserver's worldline is an arbitrary helix on the cylinder, the variational\nequation 1.3 reads\nZ\nZ\ndx1 \u2227 g(x)dx0 = 0,\n(1.4)\n\u03b4\n\u2206x0\n\n\u2206x1\n\nwhere the varied is the vector field g(x) defined on the pseudo-Euclidean\nplane (x0 , x1 ) oriented in such a way that one of its isotropic lines covers the\ncylinder-defining circle and the other corresponds to a cylinder's element. In\n2\n\n\fthis case we can speak of a relativistic consideration. If the observer's worldline corresponds to a curved line orthogonal to the flow lines of the vector\nfield g(x), where g 2 (x) > 0, then we have to use the variational equation\ndefined on a two-dimensional pseudo-Riemann manifold M induced by the\nvector field g(x), namely,\nZ\np\n\u03b4\ng 2(x\u2032 ) \u2212 det gij dx\u20320 \u2227 dx\u20321 = 0,\n(1.5)\n\u2206M\n\nwhere \u2206M = \u2206x\u20320 \u00d7 \u2206x\u20321 is an arbitrary region of the manifold M; x\u20320 (\u03c6) is\nthe flow line of the vector field g(x) parameterised by the angular coordinate\n\u03c6; x\u20321 (r) is the spatial coordinate on the cylinder (orthogonal to the observer\nworldline) parameterised by the Euclidean length\n\u0010 r; gij \u0011is the Gram matrix\ndx\u2032\n\ndx\u2032\n\ncorresponding to the pair of tangent vectors d\u03c60 , dr1 . In this case the\ndynamics of the vector field is described through the geometry of its flow\nlines [3, 4, 5].\nThus, we can say that our approach to the dynamics of the vector field\nis based on maximisation of the mass carried by the flow [6, 7], which is not\nexactly what is typically used in the ergodic theory [8, 9, 10]. However, this\nprinciple is likely to be related to the the minimum principle for the velocity\nfield [13, 14, 15], which is a special case of the more general principle of\nminimum or maximum entropy production [11, 12].\nBefore a more detailed discussion of this model we have to make a few\npreliminary notes. First, throughout this paper we shall use a somewhat\nunconventional spherical coordinates. Namely, latitude will be measured\nmodulo 2\u03c0 and longitude \u2013 modulo \u03c0. In other words, we shall use the\nfollowing spherical (\u03c1, \u03c6, \u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8n\u22122 ) to Cartesian (x1 , . . . , xn ) coordinate\ntransformation in Rn :\nx1 = \u03c1 cos \u03c6,\nx2 = \u03c1 sin \u03c6 cos \u03b81 ,\nx3 = \u03c1 sin \u03c6 sin \u03b81 ,\n.....................\nxn\u22121 = \u03c1 sin \u03c6 . . . sin \u03b8n\u22123 cos \u03b8n\u22122 ,\nxn = \u03c1 sin \u03c6 . . . sin \u03b8n\u22123 sin \u03b8n\u22122 ,\nwhere 0 \u2264 \u03c1 < \u221e, 0 \u2264 \u03c6 < 2\u03c0 and 0 \u2264 \u03b8i < \u03c0. We shall also be interpreting\nthe projective space RP n as the space of centrally symmetric lines in Rn+1 ,\nthat is, as a quotient space Rn+1 \\{0} under the equivalence relation x \u223c rx,\nwhere r \u2208 R\\{0}.\n3\n\n\f2\n\nThe geometry of the model\n\nWe can describe the geometry of our model in terms of the mapping of the\nEuclidean plane into a 2-sphere, S 2 , by winding the former around the latter.\nWe can also use similar winding maps for the pseudo-Euclidean plane into a\ncylinder, R \u00d7 S 1 , or a torus, S 1 \u00d7 S 1 . More formally this could be expressed\nin the following way [16]. Take the polar coordinates (\u03c6, \u03c1) defined on the\nEuclidean plane and the spherical coordinates (\u03b8, \u03c6) on a sphere. We can\nmap the Euclidean plane into sphere by using the congruence classes modulo\n\u03c0 and 2\u03c0. That is,\n\u03b8 = |\u03c6| mod \u03c0,\n\n\u03c6 = | \u00b1 \u03c0\u03c1|\n\nmod 2\u03c0,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere the positive sign corresponds to the interval 0 \u2264 \u03c6 < \u03c0 and negative \u2013\nto the interval \u03c0 \u2264 \u03c6 < 2\u03c0. If the projective lines are chosen to be centrally\nsymmetric then the Euclidean plane can be generated as the product RP 1 \u00d7R.\nHere the components of R are assumed to be Euclidean, i.e., rigid and with no\nmirror-reflection operation allowed. Similarly, we can define a space based on\nunoriented lines in the tangent plane to the sphere. Therefore, the sphere can\nbe generated by the product RP 1 \u00d7S 1 , the opposite points of the circle being\nidentified with each other. In this representation all centrally symmetric\nEuclidean lines are mapped as\nR \u2192 S 1 : ei\u03c0x = e\u00b1i\u03c0\u03c1\n\n(2.2)\n\nby winding them onto the corresponding circles of the sphere.\nThe winding mapping of Euclidean space onto a sphere can be extended\nto any number of dimensions. Here we are focusing mostly on the case of\nEuclidean space, R3 , generated as the product RP 2 \u00d7 R and also on the case\nof a 3-sphere generated as RP 2 \u00d7 S 1 . In both cases we assume the Euclidean\nrigidity of straight lines and the identification of the opposite points on a\ncircle. Euclidean space, R3 , can be mapped into a sphere, S 3 , by the winding\ntransformation analogous to 2.1. Indeed, for this purpose we only have to\nestablish a relation between the length of the radius-vector in Euclidean space\nand the spherical coordinate (latitude) measured modulo 2\u03c0. The relevant\ntransformations are as follows:\n\u03b81 = \u03b8,\n\n\u03b82 = |\u03c6| mod \u03c0,\n\n\u03c6 = | \u00b1 \u03c0\u03c1| mod 2\u03c0,\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere the sign is determined by the quadrant of \u03c6.\nLet (e0 , e1 ) be an orthonormal basis on a pseudo-Euclidean plane with\ncoordinates (x0 , x1 ). Let the cylindrical coordinates of R \u00d7 S 1 be (\u03c6, r).\n4\n\n\fThen the simplest mapping of this pseudo-Euclidean plane to the cylinder\nwould be\n\u03c6 = |\u03c0(x0 + x1 )| mod 2\u03c0, r = x0 \u2212 x1 .\n(2.4)\nThat is, the first isotropic line is winded here around the cylinder's crosssection (circle) and the second line is identified with the cylinder's element. In\nthis way one can make a correspondence between any non-isotropic (having\na non-zero length) vector in the plane and a point on the cylinder. For\ninstance, if a vector x having coordinates (x0 , x1 ) forms a hyperbolic angle \u03c6\nwith the e0 or \u2212e0 , then\n\u03c6 = | \u00b1 \u03c0e\u2212\u03c6 \u03c1|\n\nmod 2\u03c0 = |\u03c0(x0 + x1 )| mod 2\u03c0.\n\n(2.5)\n\nIf this vector forms the hyperbolic angle \u03c6 with the e1 or \u2212e1 , then\nr = \u00b1e\u03c6 \u03c1 = x0 \u2212 x1 ,\n\n(2.6)\n\n1\nwhere \u03c6 = \u2212 ln x0 +x\n; \u03c1 = |(x0 + x1 )(x0 \u2212 x1 )|1/2 .\n\u03c1\nBy analogy, one can build a winding map of the pseudo-Euclidean plane\ninto the torus, with the only difference that in the latter case the second\nisotropic line is winded around the longitudinal (toroidal) direction of the\ntorus.\nNow let us consider a 6-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean space R6 with the\nsignature (+, +, +, \u2212, \u2212, \u2212). In this case the analogue to the cylinder above\nis the product R3 \u00d7 S 3 , in which the component R3 is Euclidean space.\nIn order to wind the space R6 over the cylinder R3 \u00d7 S 3 we have to take\nan arbitrary pseudo-Euclidean plane in R6 passing through the (arbitrary)\northogonal lines xk , xp that belong to two Euclidean subspaces R3 of the space\nR6 . Each plane (xk , xp ) has to be winded onto a cylinder with the cylindrical\ncoordinates (\u03c6k , rp ); the indices k, p correspond to the projective space RP 2 .\nWe can take all the possible planes and wind them over the corresponding\ncylinders. The mapping transformation of the pseudo-Euclidean space R6\ninto the cylinder R3 \u00d7 S 3 is similar to the expressions 2.5 and 2.6:\n\n\u03c6k = | \u00b1 \u03c0e\u2212\u03c6 \u03c1|\n\nmod 2\u03c0 = |\u03c0(xk + xp )| mod 2\u03c0,\n\nrp = \u00b1e\u03c6 \u03c1 = xk \u2212 xp .\n\n(2.7)\n(2.8)\n\nBy fixing the running index k and replacing it with zero we can get the\nwinding map of the Minkowski space R4 into the cylinder R3 \u00d7 S 1 , which is\na particular case (reduction) of 2.7 and 2.8. Conversely, by winding R3 over\na 3-sphere, S 3 , we can generalise the case and derive a winding map from R6\ninto S 3 \u00d7 S 3 .\n5\n\n\fLet us consider the relationship between different orthonormal bases in\nthe pseudo-Euclidean plane, which is winded over a cylinder. It is known\nthat all of the orthonormal bases in a pseudo-Euclidean are equivalent (i.e.,\nnone of them can be chosen as privileged). However, by defining a regular\nfield c of unit vectors on the pseudo-Euclidean plane it is, indeed, possible\nto get such a privileged orthonormal basis (c, c1 ). In turn, a non-uniform\nunitary vector field g(x), having a hyperbolic angle \u03c6(x) with respect to the\nfield c, would induce a non-orthonormal frame (g \u2032 (x), g1\u2032 (x)). Indeed, if we\nassume that the following equalities are satisfied:\n\u03c0 = | \u00b1 \u03c0e\u2212\u03c6 \u03c1(e\u03c6 g)| mod 2\u03c0 = | \u00b1 \u03c0e\u2212\u03c6 \u03c1(g \u2032 )| mod 2\u03c0,\n\u00b1 1 = \u00b1e\u03c6 \u03c1(e\u2212\u03c6 g1 ) = \u00b1e\u03c6 \u03c1(g1\u2032 ),\n\n(2.9)\n(2.10)\n\nwe can derive a non-orthonormal frame (g \u2032(x), g1\u2032 (x)) by using the following\ntransformation of the orthonormal frame (g(x), g1(x)):\ng \u2032 (x) = e\u03c6 g(x),\n\ng1\u2032 (x) = e\u2212\u03c6 g1 (x).\n\n(2.11)\n\nThen the field g(x) would induce a 2-dimensional pseudo-Riemann manifold with a metric tensor {gij\u2032 } (where i, j = 0, 1), which is the same as\nthe Gram matrix corresponding to the system of vectors (g \u2032 (x), g1\u2032 (x)). A\nunitary vector field g(x) defined in the Minkowski space winded onto the\ncylinder R3 \u00d7 S 1 would induce a 4-dimensional pseudo-Riemann manifold.\nIndeed, take the orthonormal frame (g, g1, g2 , g3 ) derived by hyperbolically\nrotating the Minkowski space by the angle \u03c6(x) in the plane (g(x), c). Then\nthe Gram matrix gij\u2032 (i, j = 0, 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the set of vectors\n{e\u03c6 g, e\u2212\u03c6 g1 , g2 , g3 } would be related to the metric of the pseudo-Riemann\nmanifold. Note, that, since the determinant of the Gram matrix is unity\n[17, 18], the induced metric preserves the volume. That is, the differential\nvolume element of our manifold is equal to the corresponding volume element\nof the Minkowski space.\n\n3\n\nThe dynamics of the model\n\nAs we have already mentioned in Section 1, the dynamics of the velocity field\nu(x, \u03c4 ) of an ideal incompressible fluid on the surface of a cylinder R3 \u00d7 S 1\ncan be characterised by using the minimal volume principle, i.e., by assuming\nthat the 4-volume of the flow through an arbitrary 3-surface \u03a3 \u2282 R3 during\nthe time T is minimal under some initial and boundary conditions, namely:\nZ TZ\n\u03b4\ndV \u2227 u(x, \u03c4 )d\u03c4 = 0,\n(3.1)\n0\n\n\u03a3\n\n6\n\n\fwhere dV is the differential volume element of a 3-surface \u03a3. This is also\nequivalent to the minimal mass carried by the flow through the measuring\nsurface during a finite time interval.\nIn a classical approximation, by using the winding projection of the\nMinkowski space into a cylinder R3 \u00d7 S 1 , we can pass from the dynamics\ndefined on a cylinder to the statics in the Minkowski space. Let the global\ntime t be parameterised by the length of the flow line of the vector field c\nin the Minkowski space corresponding to some regular vector field on the\ncylinder and let the length of a single turn around the cylinder be h. Let\nus take in the Minkowski space a set of orthogonal to c Euclidean spaces\nR3 in the Minkowski space. The distance between these spaces is equal to\nhz, where z \u2208 Z. The projection of this set of spaces into the cylinder is\na three-dimensional manifold, which we shall refer to as a global measuring\nsurface. Then we can make a one-to-one correspondence between the dynamical vector field u(x, \u03c4 ) and the static vector field g(x), defined in the\nMinkowsky space. Thus, in a classical approximation there exists a correspondence between the minimisation of the 4-volume of the flow u(x, \u03c4 ) on\nthe cylinder and the minimisation of the 4-volume of the static flow defined\nin the Minkowski space by the vector field g(x), namely:\nZ x0 Z\n\u03b4\ndV \u2227 g(x)dx0 = 0,\n(3.2)\n0\n\n\u03a3\u2032\n\nwhere the first basis vector e0 coincides with the vector c, and the 3-surfaces,\n\u03a3\u2032 , lie in the Euclidean sub-spaces orthogonal to the vector c. Let {(ci }) =\n(c0 , c1 , c2 , c3 ) be an orthonormal basis in R4 such that c0 = c. Let the reference frame bundle be such that each non-singular point of R4 has a corresponding non-orthonormal frame (gi (x)) = (g0 , g1 , g2 , g3 ), where g0 = g(x),\ng1 = c1 , g2 = c2 , g3 = c3 . Let us form a matrix {gij } of inner products\n(ci , gj ) of the basis vectors {ci } and the frame {gi }. The absolute value of\nits determinant, det(gij ), is equal to the volume of the parallelepiped formed\nby the vectors (g0 , g1 , g2 , g3 ). It is also equal to the scalar product, (g(x), c).\nOn the other hand, the equation (g(x), c)2 = | det G(x)| holds for the Gram\nmatrix, G(x), which corresponds to the set of vectors {gi (x)} [21]. Then,\naccording to the principle 3.2, the vector field g(x) satisfies the variational\nequation\nZ\nZ\n1\n4\n\u03b4 (g(x), c)dx = \u03b4 | det G(x)| 2 dx4 = 0,\n(3.3)\n\u03a9\n\n\u03a9\n\nwhere dx4 is the differential volume element of a cylindrical 4-region \u03a9 of\nthe Minkowski space, having the height T . The cylinder's base is a 3-surface\n\u03a3 with the boundary condition g(x) = c. In order to derive the differential equation satisfying the integral variational equation 3.3, we have to find\n7\n\n\fthe elementary region of integration, \u03a9. Let \u2206\u03c0 be an infinitesimal parallelepiped spanned by the vectors \u2206x0 , \u2206x1 , \u2206x2 , \u2206x3 , with \u03c9 being a tubular\nneighbourhood with the base spanned by the vectors \u2206x1 , \u2206x2 , \u2206x3 . This\n(vector) tubular neighbourhood is filled in with the vectors |\u2206x0 |g(x) obtained from the flow lines of the vector field g(x) by increasing the natural\nparameter (the pseudo-Euclidean length) by the amount |\u2206x0 |. Then the\nlocalisation expression of the equation 3.3 gives [19]:\nZ\n1\n\u03b4\n| det G(x, t)| 2 dx4 = \u03b4 Vol \u03c9 = 0.\n(3.4)\n\u2206\u03c0\n\nSince the field lines of a nonholonomy vector field g(x) are nonparallel even\nlocally, any variation of such a field (i.e, the increase or decrease of its nonholonomicity) would result in a non-vanishing variation of the volume Vol \u03c9.\nConversely, in the case of a holonomy field its variations do not affect the\nlocal parallelism, so that the holonomicity of the field g(x) appears to be the\nnecessary condition for the zero variation of Vol \u03c9. Given a vector field g(x)\nwith an arbitrary absolute value, the sufficient conditions for the vanishing\nvariation of the volume of the tubular neighbourhood \u03c9 are the potentiality of\nthis field and the harmonic character of its potential. In terms of differential\nforms these conditions correspond to a simple differential equation:\nd \u22c6 g(x) = 0,\n\n(3.5)\n\nWhere d is the external differential; \u22c6 is the Hodge star operator; g(x) =\nd\u03c6(x); and \u03c6(x) is an arbitrary continuous and smooth function defined\neverywhere in the Minkowski space, except for the singularity points (topological features). Substituting the unitary holonomy field g(x) = k(x)d\u03c6(x)\nin 3.5, where k(x) = 1/|d\u03c6(x)|, we shall find that the unitary vector field\ng(x) must satisfy the minimum condition for the integral surfaces of the covector field dual to g(x). In this case the magnitude of the scalar quantity\n\u03c6(x) will be equal to the hyperbolic angle between the vectors g(x) and c.\nWe can also note that the potential vector field g(x) = d\u03c6(x) represented\nby the harmonic functions \u03c6(x) is the solution to the following variational\nequation:\n#\n\u00132\nZ T Z \"\u0012\n\u2202\u03c6(x, t)\n\u2212 \u22072 \u03c6(x, t) dx3 dt = 0,\n(3.6)\n\u03b4\n\u2202t\n0\n\u03a3\nin which \u03a3 is a region in Euclidean space of the \"global\" observer; the function \u03c6(x, t) is defined in the Minkowski space. Thus, the stationary scalar\nfield \u03c6(x) induced by a topological feature in the global space is identical to\nthe Newtonian gravitational potential of a mass point.\n8\n\n\fWe have to bear in mind that the space of a \"real\" observer is curved,\nsince the line for measuring time and the surface for measuring the flux is\ndefined by the vector field g(x), and not by the field c as in the case of the\nglobal observer. Therefore, if we wish to derive a variational equation corresponding to the real observer, we have to define it on the pseudo-Riemann\nmanifold M induced in the Minkowski space by the holonomy field g(x),\nwhose flux is measured through the surfaces orthogonal to its flow lines and\nwhose flow lines serve for measuring time. The metric on M is given by the\nGram matrix of four tangent vectors, one of which corresponds to the flow\nline x\u20320 (\u03c6) parameterised by the angular coordinate of the cylindrical manifold, and the three others are tangent to the coordinate lines of the 3-surface\nx\u20321 (r), x\u20322 (r), x\u20323 (r) parameterised by the Euclidean length. The following variational equation holds for an arbitrary region \u2206M of M:\nZ\n\u03b4\ng 2 (x\u2032 )dV = 0\n(3.7)\n\u2206M\n\n(under the given boundary conditions) where dV is the differential volume\nelement of M. Note that the norm of the vector g(x) coincides with the magnitude of the volume-element deformation of the pseudo-Riemann manifold,\nwhich allows making the correspondence between our functional and that of\nthe Hilbert-Einstein action.\nReturning to the global space, let us consider some properties of the\nvector field g(x). Let a point in the Minkowski space has a trajectory X(\u03c4 )\nand velocity \u1e8a. Its dynamics is determined by the variational equation:\nZ T\n\u03b4\n(g(x), \u1e8a)d\u03c4 = 0.\n(3.8)\n0\n\nThe varied here is the trajectory X(\u03c4 ) in the Minkowski space where the\nvector field g(x) is defined and where the absolute time \u03c4 plays the role of\nthe evolution parameter. For small time intervals the integral equation 3.8\ncan be reduced to\n\u03b4(g(x), \u1e8a) = 0,\n(3.9)\nwhich is satisfied by the differential equation\n\u1e8c = g(X).\n\n(3.10)\n\nTaking the orthogonal projection \u03be(\u03c4 ) = prR3 X(\u03c4 ) of the trajectory of a\ngiven topological feature in Euclidean space of the global observer, as well as\nthe projection \u2207\u03c6(X) = prR3 g(X) of the vector field g(x) at the point X(\u03c4 )\ngives a simple differential equation\n \u0308 ) = \u2207\u03c6(x),\n\u03be(\u03c4\n9\n\n(3.11)\n\n\fwhich (as in Newtonian mechanics) expresses the fact that the acceleration\nof a mass point in an external gravitational field does not depend on the\nmass.\n\n4\n\nSome implications\n\nLet us consider some implications of our model for a real observer in a classical approximation (by the real observer we mean the reference frame of a\ntopological feature). First, we can note that a real observer moving uniformly\nalong a straight line in the Minkowski space cannot detect the \"relative vacuum\" determined by the vector c and, hence, cannot measure the global time\nt. By measuring the velocities of topological features (also uniformly moving\nalong straight lines) our observer would find that for gauging space and time\none can use an arbitrary unitary vector field c\u2032 defined on the Minkowski\nspace. Therefore, the observer would conclude that the notion of spacetime\nshould be relative. It is seen that the real observer can neither detect the\nunitary vector field g(x) nor its deviations from the vector c. However, it\nwould be possible to measure the gradient of the scalar (gravitational) field\nand detect the pseudo-Riemann manifold induced by g(x).\nIndeed, in order to gauge time and distances in different points of space\n(with different magnitudes of the scalar field) one has to use the locally orthonormal basis {gi\u2032 } defined on the 4-dimensional pseudo-Riemann manifold\nwith its metric tensor {gij\u2032 }. Thus, for the real observer, the deformations\nof the pseudo-Euclidean space could be regarded as if induced by the scalar\nfield. Locally, the deformations could be cancelled by properly accelerating the mass point (topological feature), which implies that its trajectory\ncorresponds to a geodesics of the manifold.\nWe can see that the dynamics of a topological feature in our model is\nidentical to the dynamics of a mass point in the gravitational field. Indeed,\nthe scalar field around a topological feature is spherically symmetric. At\ndistance r from the origin the metric will be e2\u03c6 dt2 \u2212 e\u22122\u03c6 dr 2 , which corresponds to the metric tensor of the gravitational field of a point mass, given\ne2\u03c6 \u2248 1 + 2\u03c6 for small \u03c6. If \u03c6 = H\u03c4 , i.e., hyperbolic angle \u03c6 linearly depends from the evolutionary parameter \u03c4 , then we can compare the constant\nH with the cosmological factor.\nLet us now consider some quantum properties of our model. Let the\nabsolute value of the vector field c be a continuous function |c(x)| in the\nMinkowski space. Then the angular velocity of the flow will be:\n\u03c6\u0307(x) =\n\nd\u03c6(x)\n\u03c0\n= |c(x)|,\ndt\nh\n10\n\n(4.1)\n\n\fwhere the angular function \u03c6(x) can be identified with the phase action of the\ngauge potential in the observer space. On the other hand, it is reasonable\nto associate the angular velocity X(\u03c4 ) of the topological feature with the\nLagrangian of a point mass in the Minkowski space:\nd\u03c6(X)\n\u03c0\n= L(x).\n(4.2)\nd\u03c4\nh\nLet us consider the random walk process of the topological feature in the\ncylinder space R3 \u00d7 S 1 . Let a probability density function \u03c1(x) be defined\non a line, such that \u03c1(x),\nZ +\u221e\n\u03c1(x)dx = 1.\n(4.3)\n\u03c6\u0307(X) =\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nLet us calculate the expectation value for the random variable ei\u03c0x , which\narises when a line is compactified into a circe:\nZ +\u221e\nZ +\u221e\ni\u03c0x\ni\u03c0x\nM(e ) =\n\u03c1(e )dx =\nei\u03c0x \u03c1(x)dx = pei\u03c0\u03b1 .\n(4.4)\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nHere the quantity pei\u03c0\u03b1 can be called the complex probability amplitude. It\ncharacterises two parameters of the random variable distribution, namely,\nthe expectation value itself, ei\u03c0\u03b1 , and the probability density, p, i.e. the\nmagnitude of the expectation value. If \u03c1(x) = \u03b4(\u03b1), then M(ei\u03c0x ) = 1 * ei\u03c0\u03b1 .\nConversely, if \u03c1(x) is uniformly distributed along the line then the expectation\nvalue is M(ei\u03c0x ) = 0. It follows from these considerations that a distribution\nin R3 of a complex probability amplitude is related to random events in the\ncylinder space R3 \u00d7 S 1 .\nIn order to specify the trajectories X(\u03c4 ) in the Minkowski space with\nan external angular potential \u03c6(x) we shall use the procedure proposed by\nFeynman [22]. Let the probabilistic behaviour of the topological feature be\ndescribed as a Markov random walk in the cylinder space R3 \u00d7 S 1 . An\nelementary event in this space is a free passage. In the Minkowski space\nsuch an event is characterised by two random variables, duration, \u2206\u03c4 , and\nthe random path vector, \u2206X, whose projection into Euclidean space of the\n\u2206\u03be\n \u0307 On\nabsolute observer is \u2206\u03be. The ratio \u2206\u03c4\nis a random velocity vector, \u03be.\nthe other hand, the free passage of a topological feature corresponds to an\nincrement in the phase angle \u2206\u03c6(X) = \u03c6\u0307(X)\u2206\u03c4 (phase action) in the cylinder\nspace R3 \u00d7 S 1 .\nLet the probability distribution of the phase action has an exponential\nform, say, \u03c1(\u2206\u03c6) = e\u2212\u2206\u03c6 (neglecting the normalisation coefficient). Then,\nthe corresponding probability density for the random variable ei\u2206\u03c6 will be\n\u03c1(ei\u2206\u03c6 ) = e\u2212\u2206\u03c6 ei\u2206\u03c6 .\n11\n\n(4.5)\n\n\fUsing the properties of a Markov chain [20], we can derive the probability\ndensity for an arbitrary number of random walks:\ni\u03c6\n\n\u03c1(e ) =\n\nT\nY\n\ne\u2212\u03c6\u0307d\u03c4 ei\u03c6\u0307d\u03c4 .\n\n(4.6)\n\n0\n\nTo get the expectation value of the random variable ei\u03c6 we have to sum up\nover the all possible trajectories, that is, to calculate the quantity\ni\u03c6\n\nM(e ) =\n\nT\nXY\n\ne\u2212\u03c6\u0307d\u03c4 ei\u03c6\u0307d\u03c4 .\n\n(4.7)\n\n0\n\nIt is known that any non-vanishing variation of the phase action has a vanishing amplitude of the transitional probability and, on the contrary, that\nthe vanishing variation corresponds to a non-vanishing probability amplitude [23, 24, 25]. Then it is seen that the integral action corresponding to\nthe topological feature must be minimal. It follows that the \"probabilistic\ntrap\" of a random walk [26] in the cylinder space R3 \u00d7 S 1 is determined by\nthe variational principle \u2013 the same that determines the dynamics of a mass\npoint in classical mechanics.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nIn conclusion, we have made an attempt to describe the dynamics of spacetime (as well as of matter particles) in terms of the vector field defined on\na cylindrical manifold and based on the principle of maximum mass carried\nby the field flow. The analysis of the observational implications of our model\nsheds new light on the conceptual problems of quantum gravity.\nStill many details of our model are left unexplored. For example, it\nwould be instructive to devise the relationship between the vector field g(x)\nand the 4-potential of electromagnetic field A(x) and to consider the local\nperturbations of g(x) as gravitons or/and photons. We also expect that the\nmost important properties of our model would be revealed by extending it to\nthe cylindrical manifold R3 \u00d7 S 3 . In particular, we hope that within such an\nextended version of our framework it would be possible to find a geometric\ninterpretation of all known gauge fields. It is also expected that studying the\ndynamics of the minimal unit vector field on a 7-sphere should be interesting\nfor cosmological applications of our approach.\n\n12\n\n\fReferences\n[1] G. D.
