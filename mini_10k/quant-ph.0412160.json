The main recommendation is to assume\nthat sharp spectral states are transient outcomes of superposition, rather than permanent input components.\n\nIntroduction\nThe EPR paradox (1) is \u2013 above everything else \u2013 a logical\nconundrum. In a theory without contradictions, objective entities\nshould express one type of behavior or another, but not both at the\nsame time. Yet, quantum mechanics appears to defy this rule.\nWhen two particles are entangled, their states are perfectly\ncorrelated. If one of them is narrowed down by measurement, the\nother one is known to be sharp as well. If both of them are\nmeasured, but in different ways, then sharp values can be obtained\nfor two variables at the same time, even if the latter do not\ncommute. By implication, entangled quanta should not be able to\nviolate Bell's inequality. And still, quantum mechanics predicts the\nopposite (2,3). This is a true paradox. If the states are sharp, then\nthey must commute. If they violate Bell's inequality, then they\ncannot commute (4-8). How is it possible for the same states to be\nsharp and broad at the same time? As will be shown below, the\nsource of this problem can be traced to a conceptual ambiguity,\npertaining to the nature of linear superposition. Essentially, it is a\nmistake to assume that two sharp states belong to the same\nquantum at the same time. Though, a note on the relevant\ndefinitions is required before this discussion can proceed.\nThroughout the rest of this text, quantum properties are going to be\ndescribed as \"uncertain\" if their statistics contain multiple\nseparable states (acting one at a time). They are going to be\ndescribed as \"superposed\", with either sharp or broad spectra, if\ntheir statistics contain multiple inseparable states (acting all at the\nsame time). To avoid confusion, quanta will be described as\n\"undefined\" only if they can express incompatible types of\nbehavior in alternative measurements. In particular, a property with\nbroad spectrum is still considered to be \"well-defined\" in this\ncontext. When a variable is expected to be \"sharp\" and \"broad\" at\nthe same time, then the quantum is \"undefined\", because\nincompatible histories are required for each manifestation. This\nwill make it easier to capture the essence of the debates between\nEinstein and Bohr on the nature of entanglement.\nTo this day, the interpretation of quantum behavior is impaired\nby the widespread endorsement of two misconceptions. Number\none is the perception that quanta change their properties for\n\nevery measurement, as if they \"know\" which type of device is\ngoing to be used in each case. For example, elementary particles\nhave one spectral profile if their momentum is captured sharply,\nand a completely different profile if their position is pinned (9).\nThis fact encourages a visual image in which different devices (a\nmomentum detector versus a position detector) must be chosen\nby observers, with incompatible results. In actuality, both\nproperties can be determined with the same type of device \u2013 an\nevent counter (Fig.1). The coordinates of each detection reveal\ninformation about position and momentum with various levels of\nsharpness. Hence, the detector can be moved to a location in\nwhich the spectrum of position is narrow but the spectrum of\nmomentum is wide, or to a location in which the opposite profile\ntakes shape. In other words, it is the observers who behave as if\nthey know where to place their detectors, in order to obtain sharp\nvalues for one variable or the other. Quantum properties do not\nchange spontaneously. They always evolve as predicted by the\ncorresponding wave-function (10).\nMisconception number two concerns the role of quantum\nuncertainty. Some variables are necessarily detected with broad\nspectra, which means that several states are attributed to a single\nparticle at the same time. Yet, a single measurement can only\ncapture one state. Therefore, it is often assumed that quanta\nexpress only one spectral component at a time, with a\ncorresponding degree of uncertainty about their \"real\" state prior\nto the act of observation. The truth is that quanta express the\ninseparable effect of all the components in every single\nmeasurement (11, 12). Detection events reveal the local net state\nof superposition, i.e. the sum of all the possible state vectors that\noverlap on a relevant point of detection. For example, quanta\ncannot be observed in the areas with destructive interference in\nthe double-slit experiment. If all the components cancel out,\nquanta are physically absent (which can only happen if all the\ncomponents are active at the same time, in order to cancel out).\nInstead, of course, they are found in excess in the areas with\nconstructive interference. Accordingly, there can be no\nuncertainty as to \"which component is real\" when it comes to\nsuperposed quantum properties. Instead, there is certainty that\nall the components are involved at the same time, just as it\n\n\fbehavior in terms of particle trajectories (viz., the method of ray\ntracing). In the final analysis, it is the interpretation (rather than\nthe formalism) that needs to be improved as a solution for the\nEPR paradox.\n\nThe problem\n\nFig. 1. Geometrical representation of non-commuting wave\nproperties. Classical wave-fronts and quantum wave-functions\nhave identical patterns of evolution in free space. After passing\nthrough a lens, the waves have sharp momentum spectra and\nwide position spectra in the focal plane Fp. They have sharp\nposition spectra and wide momentum spectra in the image plane\nIp. (Only two virtual components are shown, for clarity). The\nsame pinhole detector PD can be moved from one plane to the\nother, in order to capture incompatible profiles. Hence, quantum\nproperties are not influenced by the method of detection.\nObservable qualities change because the local wave-function\nprofile changes. Caution: the rays are intended to capture the\nstructural properties of the wave-function, not the trajectories of\nindividual quanta.\n\nhappens at any point in the cross-section of a classical wavefront. To be clear, quantum states are uncertain prior to\ndetection, because it is impossible to predict the coordinates of\nindividual events. Though, any one of those probable outcomes\nis going to express the net effect of several superposed\ncomponents.\nIn a nutshell, the tradition is to assume that quantum\nmeasurements examine particle properties that are created at the\nsource. Many input states are possible, but only one is captured.\n(Alternatively, several components remain unresolved, because\nthey happen to be indistinguishable). In contrast, the formalism\nof quantum mechanics predicts the observable net states of\nrelevant wave-functions, as they happen to emerge at various\nlocations. There is an obvious mismatch between these two\nperspectives, because particle properties have to maintain a fixed\nspectrum width throughout the process of propagation. Yet, the\nnet state of the wave-function is produced by summing up\ncomponent wave amplitudes, with changing phase differences.\nIn some contexts, the same inputs can add up to a net state with\nnarrow spectrum (because components cancel out), or to a net\nstate with very wide spectrum. Even sharp quantum states are\nproduced by superposition. Instead of being stripped down to a\npermanent input component, the wave-function creates a higherlevel transient property through interference. Hence, the goal of\nthis essay is to expose the gap between the leading\ninterpretations and the actual content of the formalism of\nquantum mechanics. Specifically, many puzzles in this field\nemerge from the confusion between the input profile of a\nparticle beam and the geometrical profile of a wave-function.\nThe roots of this problem go back to \"classical times\", when it\nwas expedient \u2013 and seemed harmless \u2013 to analyze wave\n\nQuantum mechanics was called into existence by the\ndiscovery of two microscopic phenomena: the corpuscular\nnature of electromagnetic waves and the wave-like nature of\nsubatomic particles. In the history of science, this was a dramatic\nturn of events, forcing the formulation of a new class of theories.\nYet, those findings were not enough to overturn the conceptual\nfoundations of pre-modern physics. There is a clear difference\nbetween \"surprising\" observations and \"incomprehensible\"\npatterns of behavior. Indeed, classical mechanics is compatible\nwith the existence of discrete objects surrounded by fields and\nother types of dual phenomena. Accordingly, quantum theory\nwas not expected to be \"irreducibly weird\" from the start. It\nbecame perceived like that only later, when the details of\nquantum interactions defied specific predictions, derived from\nclassical models. In order to understand this problem, it is\nnecessary to review a subtle aspect of linear wave superposition.\nMechanical waves in elastic media do not transfer matter.\nThey represent propagating states of motion. However, it often\nlooks as if groups of particles are flowing with rectilinear\ntrajectories, when running waves are observed. The curious\nfeature of these \"virtual particles\" is their apparent ability to pass\nthrough each other unperturbed. If two coherent wave-trains\nintersect, they do not show any trace of interaction after overlap.\nWhether a beam of sound is present alone, or whether it crossed\na number of beams on its path, the output profile remains the\nsame. On the other hand, the process of interference is also\nobvious in the volume of overlap between beams. How is it\npossible for the waves to interfere, and yet to behave as if they\nnever did? The classical answer is provided by reference to the\nprinciple of superposition (13-15). When several waves overlap,\nthey are assumed to remain unperturbed. Yet, they are also\nindistinguishable, because they act simultaneously on detecting\ndevices. For this reason, only joint effects are observable. The\nrule is that the amplitude of the observable net wave is equal to\nthe vector sum of the component amplitudes at each point. If two\nwaves overlap crest to crest, the net state is a larger wave\n(constructive interference). If they overlap crest to trough, the\nnet state is a smaller wave (destructive interference). In other\nwords, wave behavior can always be represented by a model\nwith virtual \"running\" components that go through each other\nunperturbed. This is an essential element of geometrical\nanalysis, where the method of ray tracing represents the waves\nwith clusters of rectilinear trajectories.\nElectromagnetic waves are not mechanical waves. As shown\nby Michelson and Morley (16), their relative speed of\npropagation is invariant and cannot be reduced to a pattern of\nmotion transfer on a medium. Moreover, the discovery of\nquantization (and especially the photon hypothesis) (17) made it\nappealing to imagine the propagation of optical beams as if they\nwere streams of real particles. Indeed, the method of ray tracing\nyielded the highest dividends in geometrical optics, and it only\nseemed appropriate to suspect that optical \"rays\" were in fact\n2\n\n\fparticle trajectories. This hypothesis had a very straightforward\nand easily verifiable implication: quantum interference should be\nimpossible! In classical wave mechanics, there are no means for\nseparating the effects of individual components in superposition.\nThose effects are macroscopic. In quantum mechanics,\ncorpuscular constituents of each wave can be detected one by\none. Given the rule that input waves remain unperturbed during\noverlap, it only makes sense to suppose that elementary\ncomponents of such waves should also remain unperturbed. In\nother words, a double-slit optical projection should have\ninterference fringes at the classical level, but not at the quantum\nlevel. Unfortunately, this expectation was falsified conclusively\nby real-life experiments (18, 19). Specifically, quanta were\nfound to be present in excess in the areas with constructive\ninterference, while missing in the areas with destructive\ninterference. Despite this clear evidence of perturbation, the\nquanta were still detected in their original (\"rectilinear\") paths\nafter the volume of overlap, as if no interference ever took place.\nThe discovery of quantum interference undermined the\nclassical version of the \"underlying reality\", at least for\nelectromagnetic waves. The paradigm of the time entailed that\ninterference was a measurement artifact. The actual process had\nto consist of particles with rectilinear trajectories. Yet,\ninterference fringes were obtained at very small rates of\nemission \u2013 even when the amount of energy was sufficient for\njust a single quantum at a time. In other words, the so-called\n\"measurement artifacts\" persisted at the lowest practical levels\nof detection. By implication, the corresponding \"real\" states\ncould never be seen. How can it be that something unobservable\nis more real than something observable? After raising this\nquestion, Niels Bohr flipped the classical paradigm upside down.\nHe declared that \"what is real\" cannot be considered in isolation\nfrom \"what is measured\" (20). Therefore, the so-called\n\"measurement artifacts\" should be treated as real, rather than the\nunmeasured components. Unfortunately, this made it difficult to\nexplain the nature of incompatible measurements with selfconsistent stories. How can it be that interference is real if\nquanta are measured in the interference volume, and not real if\nmeasured afterwards? In order to avoid this problem, Bohr's\npostulate could not be treated as a mere convention. It had to be\nraised to the status of ontological law. In particular, observable\nquantum properties had to be interpreted as fundamentally real.\nMeasurements did not obscure a well-defined underlying reality.\nIn some cases, alternative experiments required contradictory\nexplanations. Yet, the observable reality was never inconsistent,\nbecause the corresponding quantum measurements were\nmutually exclusive (21). This was the basis for Bohr's famous\ncomplementarity principle: underneath the well-ordered detected\nphenomena there was no independent well-defined \"reality\". All\nof the potential histories had to co-exist at the same time, until\nthe act of measurement allowed one of them to materialize.\nContraria sunt complementa.\nBohr's interpretation required a huge leap of faith from fellow\nscientists, and not all of them were willing to make it without\nopposition. Yet, these objections had a strange tendency to\nproduce ironic results. Most famously, Einstein, Podolsky and\nRosen (1) pointed out that entangled quanta had perfectly\ncorrelated states. If one of them was measured, then the second\none was also determined. This meant that \u2013 contrary to Bohr's\n\npostulate \u2013 it was possible for unmeasured particles to have\nwell-defined properties in the absence of direct measurement.\nOnce a quantum was observed, its entangled partner had to be\neither sharp, or broad, but not both (for the same property).\nUnfortunately, there were no restrictions on the type of\nmeasurements that could be performed on the first particle. If it\nwas tested in a context that revealed a sharp property, then the\nentangled partner was sharp. If the test exposed a broad\nproperty, then the entangled partner was broad. In other words,\nthe spectrum of the same unmeasured property had to be\nobjectively sharp and broad at the same time. Its real status\ncould only be determined if the correlated partner was detected\nin one way or the other. For clarity, a broad state expresses the\njoint effect of several component vectors and is physically\ndifferent from a sharp state. It is not possible to just blame the\nmeasurement for having \"low resolution\", because the property\n(in all of its complexity) is expressed by a single quantum.\nConsequently, the EPR argument appeared to strengthen Bohr's\ninterpretation. It seemed even more compelling to assume that\nmultiple histories were virtual at the same time, until an act of\nmeasurement forced the Universe to realize one of them. Indeed,\nthe whole Universe had to be affected at the same time, because\nthe distance between entangled quanta did not matter. The\n\"reality-forming\" effects of human observations had to be\ndescribed as non-local (viz., \"spooky action at a distance\").\nIn spite of this apparent failure of \"Einstein realism\", it still\nfollowed that quantum mechanics was inconsistent with the\nCopenhagen interpretation. Suppose that two contradictory\nrealities existed at the same time, until an act of measurement on\nparticle A forced (non-locally) the entangled particle B into a\nwell-defined sharp state. This second particle (B) would still be\navailable for measurement. Therefore, it could be used to obtain\na sharp observation for a conjugate variable, directly\ncontradicting the principles of quantum mechanics. Bohr insisted\nthat quantum mechanics was correct, as well as his\ninterpretation, because of the game-changing role of\ncomplementarity (22). Still, he was not able to explain exactly\nhow this process would work for entangled quanta. The debate\nreached a stalemate and remained undecided for a long time.\nEventually, Bell's Inequality (23) inspired the development of\ntheoretical and experimental tools for accurate verification (2427). These advancements were able to prove that conjugate\nproperties can be sharply determined at the same time, by virtue\nof entanglement. Yet, these observations did not contradict the\nformalism of quantum mechanics (and Heisenberg's principle, in\nparticular), because Bell-type inequalities were conclusively\nviolated. In short, the evidence suggested that quantum states\nwere sharp and broad at the same time after the act of\nmeasurement. According to Bohr, the process of observation\nwas supposed to force the Universe into a unique self-consistent\nreality, compatible with the manifestation of classical\nphenomena. Therefore, his interpretation was falsified. At the\nsame time, the approach of Einstein and his supporters was\nequally discredited, because they expected the particle properties\nto be well-defined prior to measurement. No party was right, but\nquantum theory continued to work with unparalleled precision.\nThe paradox remained unsolved.\n\n3\n\n\fThe Solution\nThe development of classical wave mechanics was influenced\nby two major approaches. One was the method of ray tracing\n(based on geometrical analysis). The other was the method of\nwavelet integration (based on the Huygens-Fresnel formalism)\n(15,28). By the end of the 19th century, the established practice\nwas to assume that ray tracing captured the true ontology of\nwave propagation, in contrast to wavelet integration that entailed\ncorrect predictions \"for the wrong reasons\" (29). When the\nclassical paradigm was contradicted by quantum mechanical\nobservations, a new way of thinking was required. As shown\nabove, Niels Bohr carried the day by reversing the status of\n\"real\" components and \"illusory\" measurement artifacts. Still, he\npreserved the method of ray tracing as the backbone for his new\ninterpretation. In retrospect, a different solution was also\npossible. Namely, one could assume that wavelet integration\ncaptured the true ontology of propagation, while ray tracing was\nthe method with correct predictions for the wrong reasons. The\nchallenge is to define the ontological essence of the wavelet\nmodel in a practically relevant way.\nMechanical waves (such as sounds) can be described as chains\nof elastic interactions. As suggested above, a series of\nmomentum-transfer events can be identical to the undisturbed\nmotion of a free particle. For example, if a ball rolls through a\ntunnel, it is hard to guess if it went through undisturbed, or if it\nbumped into another identical ball, sending it forward. The\nsecond ball, in turn, could have also collided with another ball,\nand so on. This formal equivalence enables the use of virtual\nparticles as model systems for real waves, with remarkable\npractical advantages for quantitative analysis. The problem is\nthat 3-dimensional mechanical waves do not evolve through 1dimensional interactions. Molecules that make up gases and\nliquids do not \"bump\" into each other like billiard balls. Instead,\nthey have indiscriminate effects, pushing every particle in their\nvicinity with their fields. This effect is adequately captured by\nHuygens' concept of \"wavelet\", because the electromagnetic\nforces of each molecule obey the inverse square law and are\nmost likely to have a hemi-spherical effect on the medium in the\ndirection of their displacement. Thus, it is not possible to\nproduce a compelling wave ontology in terms of rectilinear\nprocesses at the microscopic level. Unfortunately, this nuance is\nlost in the macroscopic analysis of wave propagation. Even with\nmodern computers, it would be a daunting task to calculate the\nnet effect of all the molecules on each other, in a volume of\noscillation. Yet, the symmetry of Huygens-Fresnel propagation\nenables a methodological shortcut. Instead of calculating the\nshape of every intermediate wave-front between a source and a\ndetector, it is possible to calculate the profile of the final wavefront directly. Every point in the plane of origin is associated\nwith a macroscopic sphere (large wavelet), tangent on the plane\nof observation. The superposition of all the spheres (or, rather,\ntheir outer edges in the plane of observation) is used to calculate\nthe observable net state at the destination (30, 31). It is important\nto emphasize: this shortcut works because it gives the same\nresult as the tedious process of calculating large numbers of\nintermediate steps. However, it has become the only method\nused in practice and grew to be perceived as the correct way to\ninterpret wave propagation. In other words, every point in the\ninput wave-front is associated with a small number of relevant\n\nFig. 2. Suggested mechanism for wavelet propagation. A\ndisplaced molecule (A) pushes all the adjacent particles with its\nfield, producing a wavelet. All the displaced particles have a\nsimilar effect on their surroundings. Yet, many molecules at the\nreceiving end (such as particle B) experience the effect of several\nforces. Classical objects cannot move in multiple directions at the\nsame time. They can only move in the direction of the net force,\nproducing wavelets accordingly. That is why classical mechanical\nwaves cannot really go through each other unperturbed. Only the\nnet state of superposition can be real.\n\npoints in the output wave-front (where the tangent of the\nassociated wavelet is consequential), and all of them can be\nvisually connected with rays (32). As a result, Huygens-Fresnel\npropagation is actually interpreted with a \"ray-tracing\" model.\nFrom an ontological point of view, this practice is problematic\non several levels. First of all, the large wavelet approximation\nonly works for perfectly homogeneous media. If the process of\npropagation is constantly uniform and lossless, then the same\nfinal wave-front is predicted by any intermediate net state. The\nshortcut works, because the intervening stages are\ninconsequential. This is not the case for inhomogeneous media,\nwhere correct predictions can only be obtained by taking into the\naccount the local structural details and by time-evolving the\nwave-front in small increments (15, 31). Hence, the solution\nwith one-dimensional \"independent\" modes is not general\nenough to be ontologically compelling. Secondly, this approach\nentails conceptual difficulties. A wave is by definition a\ndetectable oscillation on a medium. If any future state is\npredicted with separable components, then the whole space\nbecomes \"the wave\", and the observable oscillation becomes \"an\nartifact\". For example, a coherent light beam passing through a\nlens produces an Airy pattern in the focal plane. This\nobservation is typically explained by showing how various\nmodes cancel out at the detector, and only a small region\ncontains the effects of constructive interference. In other words,\nthe modes are still assumed to pervade the whole medium of\npropagation, and the observable process of energy redistribution\nis treated as non-physical. \"The wave\" is no longer the wave.\n4\n\n\fFinally, this practice ignores the mechanical insight that\nmotivated the formulation of Huygens' Principle. A ripple in a\npond can be expressed as a collective effect of a row of\nwavelets. How does this actually work? Molecules are displaced\nand their fields impact every adjacent entity. Yet, every\nmolecule at the receiving end is necessarily affected by many\nwavelets at the same time (Fig. 2). When classical objects\nexperience different types of forces, they have to react by\nmoving in the direction of the net vector. The components are\nstill there, in a quantitative sense, but they are physically\nreplaced by the equivalent single output. In other words, the\nwavelets are idealized patterns that appear spherical only in\nisolation. In actual conditions, the receiving molecules have to\nexpress collective effects directly. If the net state was not always\nreal, then single objects would have to move in several\ndirections at the same time, or even transfer momentum without\nmoving at all (33). To sum up, the ontology of wavelet\npropagation is radically distorted by the assumption of separable\nmodes. Even classical mechanical waves appear problematic in\nthis light. The question is: do interpretive problems persist in\nmodels with inseparable components, in which the net state (and\nonly the net state) is assumed to be real at every step?\nA well-known problem in wave theory is the interpretation of\ncoherent interference. What mechanism is hiding under the\nmanifestation of fringe patterns? Typically, the nature of this\nprocess is explained by reference to amplitude superposition. At\nevery point of observation, the net state is exactly equal to the\nvector sum of overlapping components. In some areas, the\namplitudes happen to act in the same direction (peak to peak). In\nothers, they work in opposite directions (peak to trough). This\nexplanation requires undisturbed and separable input waves, or\nelse \u2013 it seems \u2013 the fringes would not look the way they do.\nUnfortunately, the amplitudes are not directly proportional to the\namount of incident radiation. Instead, they have to be squared\nfor proper analysis. Hence, the amount of energy in the fringes is\nnot a linear sum of input components. In particular, the center of\na bright fringe in the Young interferometer contains twice as\nmuch power as the sum of individual components measured one\nby one (Fig. 3). Indeed, it contains the same amount of energy\nthat is found to be missing in the areas with destructive\ninterference. In a ray model of wave propagation, this\nredistribution of energy can only be treated as non-physical (an\nillusory artifact of measurement). Yet, the practical\nconsequences of this process are always physical. It is not\npossible to extract useful energy from dark fringes, while the\nextra power is readily available in the bright fringes. Let us\nconsider the same problem from a molecular point of view, in a\nclassical context. Propagating waves always push forward the\nsame total momentum, but sometimes particles act on each other\nin opposite directions, and they have to recoil. As a result, some\nvolumes experience higher oscillations, at the expense of others.\nThis approach entails that linear amplitude addition is a\nquantitative artifact of wave interference (not the other way\naround). As seen on geometric diagrams, the waves appear to go\nthrough each other. As seen in real life, interference takes place.\nThe molecules in a medium do not travel with the waves. They\ncan be associated with virtual wave-fronts that go through each\nother or that undergo specular reflection. Either assumption\nentails the same final predictions (34). What matters for the\npresent discussion is that a wave \u2013 by definition \u2013 is the same\n\nFig. 3. Amplitude superposition vs. energy redistribution. (Top)\nCoherent radiation illuminates a screen with two slits, A and B. The\ntwo projections can be opened one by one, or both at the same\ntime. A pinhole detector PD is used as a power meter, to record the\nirradiance at the center of a bright fringe, where the two\ncomponents are known to arrive in phase. (Bottom) A typical\noutput of the power meter is shown. When the two projections are\nopened at the same time, the detected energy is twice as high as the\nsum of individual components. The surplus of energy in bright\nfringes, just like the deficit in the dark ones, has to be interpreted as\na measurement artifact, if the two projections are assumed to go\nthrough each other unperturbed. This is the main source of\nconceptual problems in the analysis of classical wave-fronts and\nquantum wave-functions.\n\nthing as the motion of particles that make up the medium. It is\nnot \"something else\" that pushes them around. Therefore, it is\nquite plausible (and even preferable) to interpret the observable\nnet states of linear wave superposition as objective qualities at\nany level of analysis. If they are no longer treated as artifacts,\nquantum observations can be described as real, exactly as\npostulated by Niels Bohr, but without the need to suspend\nclassical principles.\nCoherent optical beams produce exceptionally stable fringe\npatterns. Some regions are continuously dark, while others are\ncontinuously bright. The frequency of light is too high to notice\nphase relationships with the naked eye. Hence, it is too easy to\nignore them. That is why it seems so hard to imagine that a\nfringe pattern can evolve into a split-beam projection (as if two\nbeams intersected). For instance, interference gratings emit\nwave-fronts that are similar to fringe patterns, yet these\nprojections do not reconfigure in the same way. If interference is\nreal for beam superposition, how can it erase its own effects?\nThe Huygens-Fresnel formalism gives a clear answer to this\n5\n\n\fquestion: if the phases and the amplitudes of each point in the\nnet state are taken faithfully into account, the evolution of the\nwave-front must result in double projections, provided the initial\nconditions are appropriate. Though \u2013 at the microscopic level \u2013\nthe model does not contain \"beams\" followed by \"interference\".\nThere is only wavelet interference: first in the net shape of two\napproaching beams, then in the net shape of a single fringe\npattern, then again in the net shape of two departing beams.\nTraditionally, this aspect is ignored, because input beams are\neasier time-evolved independently and superposed at arbitrary\nplanes of observation. Yet, the method would contradict itself if\ntwo consecutive net states would not follow the same dynamics\nas the components that are presumed to generate them. (As a\nreminder, the original Huygens principle was not designed to\ncalculate the net states of wavelet interference and made\nerroneous predictions. That is why it had to be corrected by\nFresnel. Yet, once superposition is part of the model, it can be\napplied at any stage of propagation). This conclusion is naturally\nsupported by considerations about classical media, in which only\nnet states of motion are physically possible (33). Though, it is\nalso confirmed by optical experiments. For example, a doubleslit fringe pattern can be recorded on a holographic plate. If such\nan imprint is illuminated with a single beam, it re-creates the\nsame projection as the originally captured configuration. The\ncomplex phase details (unobservable in averaged patterns on a\nscreen) are transferred in real time onto the emerging\n\"hologram\" (35, 36). As a result, the projection is able to evolve\ninto a split pattern (either directly, or through a lens, depending\non the initial conditions), just like an actual two-beam\nsuperposition. Hence, the functional relevance of the net states\nof interference is not just a mathematical possibility \u2013 it is an\nempirical fact. Despite apprehensions to the contrary, classical\nwave mechanics is naturally compatible with the simultaneous\nreality of fringes and separable output beams. Therefore, it is not\nnecessary to invoke exotic principles (such as complementarity)\nin order to explain their manifestation.\nAnother implication of this realist approach to HuygensFresnel propagation is the non-existence of constant input\nproperties. At any given stage, the wavelets overlap to produce a\nnew frontline. This construct, in turn, is a source of new\nwavelets that interfere to produce another frontline, and so on.\n(Indeed, the frontline is an approximation. For molecular media,\nfield superposition operates at the level of each individual\nparticle that is engaged by the travelling perturbation).\nWhenever a wave property has a sharp value, it happens because\nthe individual contributions add up (and/or cancel out) to a\nspectrally narrow state. In plain language, the particles \"just\nmove\". Their motion cannot contain real separable components.\nThis conclusion is in obvious contrast to ray tracing models,\nwhere \"input\" values are presumed to be created at the source\nand carried unperturbed to the detectors (37). Accordingly, a\nmode of propagation represented by a straight \"ray\" can have\nsharp values at one location and broad values at the next. Yet,\nthis would not be due to the context of measurement. Instead, it\nwould be a reflection of the objective microscopic qualities of\nthe wave (ideally, captured by the act of measurement with\nfidelity). An interesting off-shoot of this conclusion is the\npossibility of a classical mechanism for Heisenberg's Principle.\nConjugate variables are by definition Fourier transforms of each\nother (9, 30). This means that one of them is forced to have a\n\nFig. 4. Quantum correlations without paradox. A source EQS of\nentangled quanta (photons) produces two beams. Each photon in\nthe upper beam is identical to a photon in the lower beam, by\ndesign. Therefore, the two beams are macroscopically and\nmicroscopically identical. Two identical photons will experience\nidentical interactions, each in its own path. As a result, they will\nhave identical trajectories (red lines) and will display identical\nqualities, if measured in the same way. Yet, their properties always\ncorrespond to the net state of the wave-function at the point of\nobservation. In the focal planes (FP and FP*), each of them will\nhave a sharp momentum and wide position spectrum, as if they\nbelong to collimated beams emitted straight from the source (upper\nset of blue rays). In the image planes (IP not shown and IP*), their\nspectra will have complementary profiles, as if they emerge from\nknown points on the emitting surface (lower set of blue rays). In\nactuality, the photons belong to multi-mode wave-functions, and\nthe shown geometric profiles have nothing to do with their actual\nhistory of propagation. The important aspect is that each photon\nobeys the restriction of Heisenberg's principle locally, in its own\ncontext, at every stage of propagation.\n\nnarrow spectrum, when the other is wide. A process of\ninterference can only produce a net state in which one variable\nor the other is sharp in such a pair, but never both. In this\ninterpretive context, broad spectra do not signal \"lack of\nknowledge\". They are natural states of wave variables. In order\nto observe sharp states, a wave has to be prepared accordingly,\nor captured at an appropriate location.\nAs a corollary of the above, the weirdness of quantum\nmechanics follows from the efforts to interpret the properties of\nthe wave-function with particle models of wave propagation. As\na population of (virtual) particles, the wave-function appears to\ncarry a set of sharp states from the source to the detector. For\nthis reason, broad states are perceived as \"less real\". They appear\nto contain a \"washed-out\" mix of input states that cannot be\nresolved by detectors. In contrast, a wavelet-based model\nsuggests that all the states are equally real as wave-function\nproperties, regardless of their spectral composition. The\nmicroscopic interference of wavelets is always a process with\nnumerous components. The narrow states are just a special case\nin which these components generate a simple net profile. Yet,\nthe same process of interference generates narrow and broad\nstates at the same time, because many variables are conjugated.\nNo less importantly, the properties of the wave-function can\nonly be interpreted as dynamic and local. At every new frontline\n6\n\n\fthese attributes can change, depending on the context of\npropagation. This insight can be used to develop a paradox-free\ninterpretation of entanglement.\nConsider the simple example in which two wave-fronts are\nperfectly identical at emission, and detection events are selected\nwith pinhole detectors from identical locations in the crosssection of each projection. If sharp values are desired for one\nvariable, the data needs to be collected from a plane of\nobservation where they are predicted to be possible. For\nexample, momentum states have sharp spectra in the focal plane\nof a lens (Fig. 4). If both projections are processed with identical\nlenses, coincident events will have sharp and identical\nmomentum profiles. At the same time, both of them will expose\nbroad and identical position spectra. The broad position\nspectrum and the sharp momentum spectrum are necessary and\ninseparable properties of this context of observation. On the\nother hand, if sharp values for position are required, then\nobservations need to be carried out in a different plane, i.e. the\nimage plane of the same lens. Necessarily, the spectra of\nmomentum states will be maximally wide in this new volume of\ndetection. To sum up, identical measurements will produce\nidentical results in the two projections, but no \"spooky action at\na distance\" is suspected in this case. Furthermore, each context\nof observation has its own independent profile. The sharp\nposition state from the image plane and the sharp momentum\nstate from the focal plane cannot be attributed to \"the same\"\nentity, because both of them are local products of linear\nsuperposition between multiple interfering components. Granted,\nit is possible to determine two sharp values for two noncommuting variables of the same entity, by recording\ncoincidences between the two projections in different planes of\nobservation. Still, these events do not belong to compatible\npopulations, because they come from different contexts. In\ncontradistinction with previous models, the two sharp values\ncannot be described as simultaneous hidden properties of the\nsame entity. Therefore, the EPR paradox is avoided. To be clear,\nthe problem is not removed by showing that conjugate variables\nare sharp in different contexts, because the same observation is\npresent in other approaches. It is solved by interpreting the sharp\nstates as byproducts of dynamic superposition (i.e., local net\nstates of wavelet interference). It does not matter if these\nobservations are made with classical beams or single quanta,\nbecause wave-function properties are expressed in both cases.\n\nDiscussion\nThe main property that appears to force the split between\nquantum mechanics and classical mechanics is separability (38,\n39). When a classical particle system produces observable\nevents, it is possible to detect macroscopic joint effects with\ninseparable components. However, particles do not cease to exist\njust because they act together. At least as a matter of principle,\ntheir individual behavior is theoretically and empirically\nseparable at the microscopic level. In the early days of quantum\nmechanics, both Einstein and Bohr expected elementary\nparticles to display separability. Einstein changed his mind after\nstudying the work of Bose, while Bohr switched positions after\nthe disproof of the Bohr-Kramers-Slater theory (40). By the time\nof the 1927 Solvay meeting, both of them agreed that quantum\n\nstates should be inseparable (i.e., entangled) and both of them\nperceived this as a radical departure from \"realist\" classical\nphysics. As it is known, Bohr saw this as a sign that new\nconcepts are needed for the understanding of the Universe (such\nas complementarity), while Einstein worried that quantum\nmechanics cannot capture the complete reality of microscopic\ninteractions. Further on, this insight informed Schrodinger's\nwork on his famous wave equation (41). The latter was\npurposefully developed in 3N-dimensional phase space, in order\nto express the primary relevance of the net states of linear\nsuperposition between inseparable components (40, 42, 43).\nThe concept of separability has grown into a fountain of\nconfusion over time, because of the difficulty of reaching\nconsensus over its object. What exactly is inseparable in\nquantum mechanics? As the word \"inseparable\" was replaced by\nthe word \"entangled\", and as the debates increasingly focused on\nexperiments with correlated entities, the widespread perception\nhas become that different events can become inseparable from\neach other. Yet, this is obviously incorrect, because correlated\nsystems are detected in separate conditions (one \"over here\", and\nthe other \"over there\"). By definition, \"entangled\" quanta\nemerge after breaking apart from a common system and are\nproduced in a manner that enables independent observations.\nThe real issue in this context is the nature of a particle that seems\nto be \"in many states at the same time\". When a single object\nexpresses the effect of multiple components, it can only move in\nthe direction of the net state. Therefore, the many constituents of\na wide spectrum cannot be detected one by one in actual\nexperiments. Einstein and Bohr had been sparring over\nseparability long before the EPR paper (44-46). They both saw it\nas a measurement artifact, and disagreed over the ontological\nsignificance of the act of observation. Indeed, correlated quanta\nwere brought into this discussion in order to explore the\npossibility of undetectable separability (47-49). A particle must\nbe assumed to have many states at the same time prior to\nmeasurement, yet the reality of individual components can be\nexposed indirectly, by measuring a correlated \"twin\" (or, so it\nseemed at the time). Another way to look at this is that a\nquantum can be measured only once, yet more than one property\ncan be determined with the help of correlated systems. Hence,\nthe object of correlation tests is to determine the relationships\nbetween multiple qualities of a single quantum. If one of these\nqualities has inseparable components, then the relationships\nbetween them will obey certain rules (e.g., Heisenberg's\nPrinciple, whose effect determines the profile of Tsirelson's\nInequality). The true mystery of quantum mechanics is that\nsingle particles express inseparable qualities when detected one\nat a time, and joint effects seem impossible.\nAs shown above, the special concepts and principles of\nquantum mechanics can be derived from the details of\nmicroscopic interactions that determine the properties of\nclassical mechanical waves. The crucial insight is that\nseparability applies to the joint effects of discrete particles.\nWhen it comes to the nature of individual states of motion, there\nare no logical or empirical reasons to invoke it. Yet, waves\nrequire an ontological explanation in terms of states of motion\n(for which the net states alone can be real), because the medium\ndoes not travel with the propagating oscillations. Accordingly,\nthe properties of quanta cannot be expected to be necessarily\n7\n\n\fseparable when determined by their context of propagation.\nIncidentally, this conclusion does not depend on any particular\nassumption about the nature of quantum wave-functions. As\nlong as the properties of quanta are determined by an external\nprocess with wave-like net states, the same considerations apply.\nLikewise, this presentation does not entail that waves alone are\nreal and that quantum particles do not exist. The only necessary\nimplication is that event-producing quanta (regardless of their\nactual nature) must express the qualities of the associated (or\nguiding) wave-functions. It is not the particles that add up to the\nprofile of a wave-function. It is the wave-function that\ndetermines their individual properties. To some readers, such\nconclusions might sound counterintuitive. After all, so many\ntextbooks insist that quantum mechanics is irreducibly nonclassical. The thing to keep in mind is that classical wave\ninteractions have been interpreted with particle models (derived\nfrom ray tracing), while classical particles are \u2013 of course \u2013 also\ninterpreted with particle models. For this reason, separability\nappears to be a necessary component of any kind of classical\napproach. Still, the main point of the preceding argument is that\nclassical wave models can be developed in two different ways,\nand that one of them is free of such conceptual complications.\nThe obvious question is to ask is: what about non-locality? Let\nus recall why it was seen as necessary in the first place. When\nthe momentum of a quantum is determined with a sharp\nmeasurement, the state of its correlated partner is also known. If\nthis analysis is performed within a particle model of the wavefunction, then the inferred quantity is assumed to persist with the\nquantum from the source to the detector. Therefore, this sharp\nmomentum state is assumed to be present even when the input\nposition of the second quantum is \"revealed\". Consequently,\ncorrelated particles are expected to have sharp states for\nmomentum and position at the same time, and must also produce\ncorrelation coefficients below the limit of any Bell-type\ninequality (2). This interpretive conclusion is at odds with\nquantum theory and the experimental record. Therefore, some\nsort of invisible demon must be invoked for compliance with the\nestablished facts. The name of this invisible demon is\nnonlocality. Hence, \"spooky action at a distance\" is just an\ninterpretive element, intended to reconcile a contingent\nassumption with a verifiable conclusion. Its only purpose is to\nexplain why two variables with apparently simultaneous sharp\nstates do not commute. On the other hand, if the wave-function\nproperties are interpreted with a wavelet model, then the\nontological implications are fundamentally different. When\nmomentum and position are macroscopic wave properties, they\nnever commute. They represent collective effects, and their\nspectra \u2013 by definition \u2013 can only be inversely proportional at\nevery step of propagation. As shown above, the process of sharp\nobservation of two conjugate variables requires mutually\nexclusive contexts of propagation. Accordingly, they still obey\nHeisenberg's principle locally. If so, then entangled quanta can\nalways display correlations that reach as high as Tsirelson's limit\n(6, 8, 50). Simply put, predicted violations of Bell-type\ninequalities are due to the fact that wave-function variables are\nwave (rather than particle) properties. In the absence of any\nconflict between interpretation and theory, there is no need to\ninvoke invisible demons.\n\nSummary\nThe macroscopic properties of classical waves can be\npredicted with two equivalent models. On the one hand, they can\nbe analyzed as a stream of (virtual) particles with rectilinear\ntrajectories that go through each other unperturbed. On the other\nhand, they can be explained through a complex process of\nwavelet interaction. In the first case, wave superposition is\nperceived as an artifact of measurement, because detectors are\npresumed to respond to multiple independent components at the\nsame time. In the second case, superposition is an objective\nprocess that works at the microscopic level. These two models\nentail the same macroscopic predictions for a large class of\nphenomena, but their microscopic unobservable implications are\nradically different. In particular, the particle model is not able to\nexplain the nature of wave diffraction, or the relevance of\nfrequency for the parameters of interference. More importantly,\nit leads to fundamental conceptual inconsistencies during the\ninterpretation of all types of waves, from mechanical oscillations\nto quantum wave-functions. These complications are absent in\nthe wavelet model. Therefore, the puzzles of quantum\nmechanics, including the EPR paradox, can be solved by\nswitching the interpretation of wave-function properties from a\nparticle to a wavelet model.\nQuantum phenomena are observed by accumulating large\nnumbers of discrete events. The most intuitive explanation is\nthat individual events are produced by objectively discrete\nentities (i.e., quanta). Yet, the distributions of these events\ncannot be interpreted as patterns of \"underlying\" particle\nbehavior. They always reflect wave properties, which is why\nthey are predicted with notorious accuracy by wave-functions. In\nshort, scientists detect particles, but acquire information about\nwave properties. A special quality of all the waves is their ability\nto express the effect of multiple states in superposition. If the\nmechanism of wave propagation is interpreted with a particle\nmodel, all the superposed component states are assumed to be\nindependent and real at the same time. Indeed they are presumed\nto be carried intact from the point of emission to the point of\ndetection. In contrast, if the mechanism of wave propagation is\ninterpreted with a wavelet model, the superposed components\nare treated as virtual. Different wavelets from different source\npoints interfere, producing a net state. From a physical point of\nview, only the net state is real in this analytical context. The socalled components are derived by breaking down the observed\ncomplex state into simple constituents (Fourier decomposition).\nThey represent the minimal list of virtual ingredients that could\nbe used to synthesize the net state in the easiest way possible. If\nmost of the actual (wavelet) components cancel out and only a\nsimple net state remains, then the output spectrum is sharp. If the\nnumber of such components remains large, because of the nature\nof phase relationships between real inputs, then the net spectrum\nis wide. In short, particle models of the quantum wave-function\ndescribe permanent properties, distorted by the context of\nmeasurement. Wavelet models describe transient local\nproperties, created by the context of propagation. In this\napproach, if quanta are assumed to be real, they must always\nswitch to the net state of their local environment, like\nchameleons. At every stage of propagation, their properties can\nchange, but they are always captured by the act of measurement\nin their objective state (assuming no measurement artifacts).\n8\n\n\fThe essence of the EPR paradox is the implication that quanta\nhave broad states even after exhibiting sharp states in special\nmeasurement settings, as if their spectra are broad and sharp at\nthe same time. This problem is caused by the assumption that\nquanta express permanent particle qualities. When a\nmeasurement reveals a narrow spectrum, it is assumed to capture\nthe \"real\" state (which is otherwise smeared by \"low resolution\"\nobservations). In this approach, two entangled quanta are\nassumed to be correlated because of the relationships between\ntheir intrinsic properties, regardless of their context of\npropagation. Hence, when a sharp property is captured in one\ncontext and the second one is recorded in another, both\nproperties are attributed to the same entity at the same time, with\nparadoxical consequences. None of these complications arise in\na wavelet approach in which quantum states are interpreted as\ntransient and local. If the net states of superposition are always\nreal, then the same level of reality is attributed to a quantum\nproperty whether its spectrum is sharp or broad. More\nimportantly, when a quantum is measured, the state of its\nentangled partner is only determined for an identical context of\npropagation, where it can be confirmed by experiment. In all\nother contexts, the quanta are assumed to have different\nproperties, with different spectral profiles. The correlation\nbetween entangled partners follows from the properties of their\ncontexts of propagation \u2013 they are presumed to experience\nidentical (or otherwise correlated) stages of interference at each\nstep, after breaking apart from a joint quantum system.\nMoreover, conjugated variables have spectra with inversely\nproportional width in each context of propagation, simply\nbecause they represent wave qualities. Thus, quanta cannot be\ndescribed as having several sharp states at the same time for\nnon-commuting features, and the EPR paradox is avoided.\nThis solution was obtained by reinterpreting the sharp\nquantum spectra as outcomes of wavelet interference.\nPreviously, the apparent problem was to explain the nature of\nstates with wide spectra. (\"How is it possible for a quantum to be\nin many states at the same time?\") The sharp states were\nassumed to be real by default. In contrast, the new approach\nentails that simple quantum states are problematic. (\"How is it\npossible for a quantum property to have a sharp spectrum, if\nevery state is a result of multiple component superposition?\")\nThe explanation is that narrow spectra emerge in special cases,\nwhen multiple inputs interfere and cancel out (or add up) to a\nsimple net state. When such qualities persist in space and time, it\nis because they are continuously (re)created by waves, rather\nthan transported unperturbed by particles.\n\nReferences:\n1. A. Einstein, B.
