The competition between capillary and\nmagnetic forces is characterized by the magnetic Bond\nnumber Bm = 4M 2 R/\u03c3 where M = \u03c7H is the fluid\nmagnetization and \u03c7 the initial magnetic susceptibility\nwhich obeys (approximately) the Curie law. The critical\nvalue Bmc = (4\u03c72 R/\u03c3)Hc2 for the shape instability with\nrespect to a n-lobe mode depends on n and on the ratio\np = 2R/h of the droplet diameter to the cell thickness\n[4,5]. The dependence Bmc (p) for n = 2, 3 ..., 7 calculated by Drikis [6] is shown in Fig. 1.\nReturn now to the hot droplet. Luo, Du, and Huang\nreported that \"the temperature difference is about 15 K\nbetween the beam axis and the beam edge. However,\nthe temperature continues to decrease outside the beam\nand levels off at several beam widths ; the corresponding\ntemperature difference is about 40 K \". So, as the radius\nof laser beam was \u03c1 = 6.7 \u03bcm, an estimate R \u2243 3\u03c1 =\n20 \u03bcm looks pretty reasonable. The fluid used in [1] had\nthe value 4\u03c0\u03c7 = 0.94 at room temperature. Thus we\nfind \u03c7 = 0.07 at T = 315 K: by our estimate, it is the\ntemperature at the edge of the droplet, r = R. For the\ncell thickness h = 100 \u03bcm (i.e., p = 0.4) and n = 3\n(triangle) Fig. 1 predicts Bmc = 38. Substituting above\nparameters into\np\n(1)\nHc = (2\u03c7)\u22121 (\u03c3/R)Bmc ,\n\nIn a recent experiment [1], a vertical laser beam created a hot spot in a thin horizontal ferrofluid layer. Since\nthe Soret coefficient for the fluid was positive and large,\nmagnetic grains (of which the ferrofluid was composed)\neffectively migrated towards cold regions. Therefore, the\nconcentration of the grains inside the hot fluid volume\nappeared to be much lower than outside, hence the hot\nspot became transparent. Being initially round, the area\nof transparency transformed under the action of a strong\nenough vertical magnetic field into n-lobe polygons. Luo,\nDu, and Huang interpreted the phenomenon as \"a new\nconvective instability... The triangular shape originates\nfrom 6 convective rolls with their axes parallel to the\noptic axis. Accordingly, an 8-roll state gives rise to a\ntetragon and 10-roll state a pentagon\". The rolls, however, exist only in imagination of the authors of [1]. If\nthe rolls had existed in reality, they would have been directly visible in the same experiment. Fortunately, there\nis no necessity in such an odd explanation based on unobservable convective rolls. There is a much more plausible\ninterpretation of observations from [1].\nThe hot fluid volume may be considered as a nonmagnetic inset \u2013 \"bubble\" \u2013 surrounded by the magnetic\nfluid. The border of the bubble has to be sufficiently\ndistinct since the temperature steeply decreases with the\ndistance from the laser beam axis [1]. Thus one can introduce an effective radius R of the hot droplet and its\nsurface tension \u03c3 . The latter has a pure magnetic origin: the volume fraction of magnetic grains \u03c6 was 6%\nat r > R, and it was negligible at r < R. Hence, the\nsurface tension on the border r = R can be estimated\nby the expression \u03c3 \u223c m2 /D\u03045 , where m stands for the\nmagnetic moment of a single particle and D\u0304 is the mean\ndistance between the particles outside the droplet. Sub \u0304 \u22121/3 we arrive at\nstituting m = (\u03c0 d \u03043 /6)Ms and D\u0304 = d\u03c6\n \u0304 5/3 , where d \u0304 = 9 nm is the mean parti\u03c3 \u2243 (\u03c0Ms /6)2 d\u03c6\ncle diameter and Ms = 480 G is the bulk magnetization\nof dispersed magnetite. For afore-cited parameter values\nfrom [1], we obtain \u03c3 \u2243 5.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 dyne/cm what is five\norders less than the surface tension of water.\n\nwe obtain Hc = 22.4 Oe that agrees well with experimental value Hcexp = 22 Oe. In experiment [1], the\ncritical field decreased when the sample thickness was\nlowered. Indeed, for h = 50 \u03bcm and the same R we\nhave p = 0.8 and Bmc = 20 which corresponds to the\nvalue Hc = 15.7 Oe. The latter is sufficiently close to\nHcexp = 13 Oe. Thus, we have demonstrated that quite\nwell established facts of the physics of magnetic fluids\nare sufficient to explain the experimental results [1] in a\nsimple and reasonable way.\nI am grateful to I.
