Introduction\nPSR J0218+4232 is a 2.3 ms pulsar in a two day orbit\naround a \u223c 0.2 M\u2299 white dwarf companion (Navarro et\nal. 1995) with a period derivative of \u1e56 = 8 \u00d7 10\u221220 s s\u22121 .\nThe pulsar has a spin-down energy of \u0116 = 2.5 \u00d7 1035 erg\ns\u22121 , a dipolar magnetic field component at the star surface\nof B\u22a5 = 4.3 \u00d7 108 G and a spin-down age of \u2264 4.6 \u00d7\n108 years. The pulsar distance inferred from its dispersion\nmeasure and from the electron density model of Taylor &\nSend offprint requests to: T. Mineo: mineo@ifcai.pa.cnr.it\n\nCordes (1993) is \u2265 5.7 kpc. A detection of the companion\nstar at optical wavelength was reported recently by Van\nKerkwijk (1996).\nSoft X-ray emission from the pulsar was first detected\nby Verbunt et al. (1996) using the ROSAT HRI. A followup observation confirmed the detection and discovered Xray pulsation at a significance of about 5 \u03c3 using 200 HRI\ncounts (Kuiper et al. 1998). The X-ray pulse profile deduced from those data is characterized by a sharp main\npulse with an indication of a second peak at a phase separation of \u2206\u03c6 \u223c 0.47. The pulsed fraction inferred from\nthe ROSAT HRI data is 37\u00b113 %. Furthermore, Kuiper\net al. (1998) show that the measured large DC component is consistent with a \u223c 14\u2032\u2032 diameter compact nebula\nsurrounding the pulsar, but confirmation is required. However, it is interesting to note that also in the radio domain\nthe source exhibits an unusually high DC component of\n\u223c 50 % (Navarro et al. 1995). The HRI provides no spectral information and the number of counts recorded in a\nserendipitous off\u2013axis PSPC observation does not allow\nspectral modeling. Also ASCA detected this source, however, the observation was too short: no pulsation could be\nseen, and a spectral fit with a power\u2013law photon index\nof 1.6\u00b10.6 could only be made to the weak total excess\n(Kawai & Saito 1999). Therefore, no detailed spectral information on the pulsed X-ray emission was available prior\nto the BeppoSAX observation reported in this paper (see\nBecker & Tr\u00fcmper 1999 for a review of the X-ray properties of millisecond pulsars).\nNoting the spatial coincidence of PSR J0218+4232\nwith the EGRET source 2EG J0220+4228, Verbunt et\nal. (1996) tentatively identified the pulsar with the high-\n\n\f2\n\nT. Mineo et al.: Pulse shape and spectrum of PSR J0218+4232 observed with BeppoSAX\n\nenergy \u03b3-ray source. Using some additional EGRET observations, and applying a combination of spatial and\ntiming analysis, Kuiper et al. (1999) conclude that 2EG\nJ0220+4228 is probably a multiple source: between 0.1\nand 1 GeV PSR J0218+4232 is the most likely counterpart, and above 1 GeV the bright BL Lac 3C 66A is the\nbest candidate counterpart. The third EGRET catalog\n(Hartman et al. 1999), which is based on more viewing\nperiods than the 2EG catalog, identifies 3EG J0222+4253\n(2EG J0220+4228) with 3C 66A, rather than with the mspulsar. However, in a note on this source, they indicate\nthat the identification with 3C 66A stems from the catalog position based on the > 1 GeV map. Furthermore,\nthey confirm that for lower energies (100-300 MeV) the\nEGRET map is consistent with all the source flux coming\nfrom the pulsar, 3C 66A being statistically excluded.\nIn this paper we present the results of a BeppoSAX\nobservation of PSR J0218+4232 which, for the first time,\nprovides detailed information on the pulsar's temporal and\nspectral emission properties across a wide band from 1 to\n10 keV.\n2. Observation\nPSR J0218+4232 was observed on January 1999 14\u201316 by\nthe Narrow Field Instruments (NFIs) aboard BeppoSAX\nsatellite (Boella et al. 1997a). We report in this paper\nonly results from data collected with the MECS instrument (Boella et al. 1997b), sensitive in the energy range\n1-10 keV; the net exposure time was 82 795 s. The LECS\ninstrument (0.1\u201310 keV; Parmar et al. 1997) observed the\nsource for a much shorter time due to the constraint on\noperating only during spacecraft night. The HPGSPC (4\u2013\n60 keV; Manzo et al. 1997) was not working during the\nobservation. A signal detected with the PDS (13\u2013200 keV;\nFrontera et al. 1997) will be shortly discussed in Section\n5. No pulsed signals have been detected in the LECS and\nPDS data.\nDuring the observation only two of the three MECS detectors were operating (MECS2 and MECS3). MECS has\na field of view of 56\u2032 and an angular resolution of about\n1.\u2032 2 at 6 keV. During the observation of PSR J0218+4232\nthe instrument operated in direct mode, transmitting to\nground information on each individual photon. Standard\nprocedures and selection criteria were applied on the observation data to avoid the South Atlantic Anomaly, solar,\nbright Earth and particle contaminations1 . Event reduction has been performed using the SAXDAS v.2.0.0 package.\n3. Spatial analysis\nA 100 ks ROSAT HRI (0.1\u20132.4 keV) observation of PSR\nJ0218+4232 (see Kuiper et al. 1998) revealed 7 X-ray\n1\n\nsee http://www.sdc.asi.it/software/cookbook as a reference\nabout the data analysis software and reduction procedures.\n\nsources within a radius of \u223c 5\u2032 around our target (see Fig.\n1). Given the extended tails of the MECS Point-Spread\nFunction (PSF), accurate spatial analysis is required to\nseparate the signal of PSR J0218+4232 from that of any\nneighbouring sources. We used a Maximum Likelihood approach in searching for individual sources on top of a background model, as well as for analyzing simultaneously several sources and a background model.\nThe search is applied on various equidistant trial positions within a selected part of the instrument field of view,\nwhere it checks for the presence of a source taking into account the Poissonian nature of the data. Maximum Likelihood Ratio (MLR) tests are performed describing in the\nzero H0 hypothesis the 2-d event distribution in terms of\na flat background model only, while in the alternative H1\nhypothesis the data is described in terms of a point source\nat the trial position and a flat background model (see e.g.\nKuiper et al. 1998 for a more detailed description).\nThe improvement in the likelihood L between H0 and\nH1 computed from the quantity Q = \u22122 ln(LH0 /LH1 )\nyields simultaneously the detection significance and\nstrength of the source. The probability distribution of Q\nis that of a \u03c72 for n1 \u2212 n0 degree of freedom (d.o.f.) where\nn0 and n1 are the d.o.f. for the H0 and H1 hypotheses, respectively. In searching for sources n1 \u2212 n0 = 3, while in a\ndetection test of a known source n1 \u2212n0 = 1. The distribution of Q as a function of trial position is the MLR\u2013map.\nWe applied the above approach to the MECS data\nwithout energy selection allowing for maximum source\nstatistics. We used an energy averaged PSF assuming a\npower\u2013law spectral shape of index 1.5, given by the following expression:\nP SF (x, y) =\nR\u221e\n0\n\nE\n\n\u22121.5\n\n* (S2 (E) + S3 (E)) * P SF (x, y | E) * dE\nR\u221e\n, (1)\n\u22121.5 * (S (E) + S (E)) * dE\n2\n3\n0 E\n\nwhere S2 (E) and S3 (E) are the sensitive areas of the two\noperating MECS units. The P SF (x, y | E) is modelled\nusing the parametric form given in Boella et al. (1997b).\nFurthermore, we investigated the impact of the assumed\npower\u2013law index on the MLR results and found that this\nis negligible, as expected by the moderate dependence on\nenergy of the PSF.\nThe resulting MLR map/image is shown in Fig. 1a.\nThe maximum value in this figure (> 21 \u03c3) is reached at a\nposition consistent with that determined by the ROSAT\nHRI for PSR J0218+4232 (indicated by a star symbol).\nIt is, however, evident that several of the sources detected\nby ROSAT below 2.4 keV (indicated by filled triangles)\ncontribute significantly to the extended excess. We can\nshow this better, by repeating the search for sources on\ntop of a flat background model and a point source at\nthe pulsar position (effectively \"subtracting\" the counts\nfrom PSR J0218+4232 from Fig. 1a). The remaining extended feature (Fig. 1b) clearly follows the distribution of\n\n\fT. Mineo et al.: Pulse shape and spectrum of PSR J0218+4232 observed with BeppoSAX\n\n3\n\nFig. 1.

The contours start at a value of 3 \u03c3 source detection significance with a stepsize\nof 2 \u03c3 (for 1 d.o.f.) or equivalently at Q values (see text) of 9, 25, 49, . . ..

Taking as source radial profile the PSF,\nand as noise the measured radial count distribution, we obtained the value r = 100\u2032\u2032 . Note that none of the nearby\nsources fall within this radius. The selected region contains 62 % (250 counts) of the MECS source signal; the\nnumber of background events in the same area is 92 with\na contribution from the neighbouring sources of 12 counts.\n4.

This effect corresponds to an uncertainty in the\nphoton phases of 0.087.\n\nTable 1.

PSR J0218+4232 light curve in the 1\u201310 keV range as\nobserved by the MECS (top panel) and at 610 MHz (bottom\npanel, Stairs et al. 1999). In the top panel a typical statistical\n1 \u03c3 error bar is shown and the MECS background level as\ndetermined in the spatial analysis is indicated as a grey band,\nrepresenting the \u00b11 \u03c3 widths. The two horizontal bars above\nthe MECS profile indicate the definitions of the phase intervals\nfor the two peaks, Peak 1 (P1) and Peak 2 (P2), as explained\nin the text. The alignment between the two curves is arbitrary\n\nanalysis and therefore includes the contributions from the\nneighbouring sources. In the same figure (bottom panel)\nthe 610 MHz profile as derived by Stairs et al. (1999) is\nalso presented. The phase relation between the two profiles is unknown for the time being: they have been arbitrarily aligned. Notice that, like in the radio light curve,\nthe MECS profile is not simple: it has a prominent double peak structure with a relative phase separation (centre\nto centre) of 0.47\u00b10.05, confirming the value derived by\nKuiper et al. (1998) from ROSAT data below 2.4 keV.\nThe phase histograms for 1.6\u20134 keV and 4\u201310 keV are\n\nshown respectively in the middle and bottom panels of\nFig. 3. The ROSAT (0.1\u20132.4 keV) profile (Kuiper et al.\n1998), shifted in phase to obtain the highest peak coincident with the most significant one in the MECS softer\nlight curve (middle panel), is also shown for comparison\nin the top panel of Fig. 3. These profiles clearly show a\nchange of the relative peak intensities. The peak at phase\n0.8 is stronger in the low energy histograms (top and middle panels), while that at phase 0.3 is more prominent at\nhigh energies (bottom panel).\nThe structure measured in the MECS light curves of\ntwo peaks separated by narrow valleys and the uncertainty\ndue to the OBT\u2013UTC conversion residuals make it difficult to establish an unpulsed interval: slightly different\nvalues could affect the unpulsed level. Notice, moreover,\nthat while in the ROSAT profile a DC component is apparent above the background level, the same does not hold\nfor the 4\u201310 keV profile, where the background level is\nconsistent with those measured in the valleys of the light\ncurve. In the intermediate energy profile, at face value,\nthere might be some evidence of a DC component but not\nas high as in the ROSAT profile. Such effect could be due\nto the presence of a quite soft unpulsed emission. In an\nattempt to quantify the evidence for a DC component,\nwe applied the bootstrap method proposed by Swanepoel\net al. (1996), which allows to estimate the DC level, and\ntherefore also the pulsed fraction, working directly on the\nphases of individual photons. However, in the available\nform, this method is able to find only one unpulsed interval and cannot account for systematic errors. One should\ntherefore realize that the quoted errors on the calculated\nparameters are only statistical. Using this algorithm we\nfound, for the whole MECS energy band, an unpulsed interval of 0.47\u20130.61 and a corresponding pulsed fraction of\n0.73\u00b10.12 (1 \u03c3 error). Notice that the average count level\nin the interval \u22120.08\u20130.15 is statistically not different from\nthat measured in the former interval. The resulting DC\u2013\nfractions for the three bands of Fig. 3 are shown in Fig. 4.\nThe decrease with energy is clearly visible, but the error\nbars are large and the trend deviates only at the 2.4 \u03c3\nlevel from a flat distribution. Given the large error bars\nand the systematic uncertainties, we did not derive a detailed spectrum of the DC component.\nThe relatively high scatter in the residuals of our timing solution (up to \u223c0.2 ms) does not allow to determine\naccurately the intrinsic widths of the two pulses. The total\nscatter in the event arrival times at the SSB might even\nbe consistent with the measured width of P1 in Figure 2.\nWe defined the phase intervals containing the two\npulses as follows: Peak 1 (P1) phase interval 0.61-0.95\nand Peak 2 (P2) 0.10-0.47, where P1 is identified with the\nobvious ROSAT peak and appears to have a softer spectrum than P2. The statistical significance of the suggested\nchange in morphology of the phase histogram with energy\ncan be evaluated by the P2/P1 ratio. This ratio, computed\nin the energy bands 1.6\u20134 keV and 4\u201310 keV after back-\n\n\fT.

(1998), indicated\nby a filled circle, is evaluated using the same phase definitions. Including the ROSAT point, a correlation of P2/P1\nwith energy is evident, but the statistical significance is\nonly 2 \u03c3, and confirmation is needed.\n\nFig. 4.

Note the increase of the P2 peak strength with\nrespect to P1 with energy. The hatched area represents the\nunpulsed level (\u00b11 \u03c3) determined in a bootstraping analysis of\nthe phase histogram, while the grey area represents the background level with 1 \u03c3 errors determined in the spatial analysis\n\nSpectral fits were performed on the background subtracted\nMECS data binned logarithmically after checking that\neach single energy channel contains at least 20 photons.\nThe NH was fixed to the value of 5\u00d71020 cm\u22122 (see Verbunt et al. 1996). We fitted the total pulsed spectrum, i.e.\nthe excess counts above the unpulsed level in the phase\nhistogram, with a power\u2013law model, taking into account\nthe energy dependent interstellar absorption. The resulting photon index is \u03b1 = 0.61\u00b10.32, with a 2\u201310 keV flux\nF = 4.1 \u00d7 10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , and a reduced \u03c72r of\n0.7 (3 dof). A fit with a black body spectral distribution\ngives kT = 2.3 \u00b1 0.5 keV, with a \u03c72r = 1.4 (3 dof). Both\nthe \u03c72 values are acceptable, the black body temperature\nT = 2.6 \u00d7 107 K, however, is quite higher than the values measured for the thermal components of other pulsars\nthat typically does not exceed \u223c 5 \u00d7 106 K (Greiveldinger\net al. 1996, Becker & Tr\u00fcmper 1997, 1999). Fig. 6 also\nshows the spectra for the pulses P1 and P2 separately, using the same energy bins as for the total pulsed spectrum.\nWe fitted again power-law models for each of the spectra,\n\n\f6\n\nT. Mineo et al.: Pulse shape and spectrum of PSR J0218+4232 observed with BeppoSAX\n\nbut the low statistics result in large errors in the estimated\nparameters. The measured spectral indices of P1 and P2\nare 0.84 \u00b1 0.35 and 0.42 \u00b1 0.36 respectively, in agreement\nwith the trend seen in the P2/P1 ratio.\nFinally, we determined the total spectrum (pulsed plus\nDC) applying the Maximum Likelihood approach to the\nspatial distributions in smaller energy intervals (see also\nFig. 6). The fit with a power\u2013law gives a photon spectral\nindex \u03b1 = 0.94\u00b10.22 with a 2\u201310 keV flux F = 4.3\u00d710\u221213\nerg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , about 10 % higher than the pulsed value\ngiven above, and a reduced \u03c72r of 0.56 (8 dof).\nGiven the hard spectra found above, we also analysed the\nPDS data to investigate whether there was any signal from\nPSR J0218+4232 at higher energies, even though an extrapolation of the total spectrum measured in the MECS\nto the PDS range predicts a flux well below the PDS sensitivity threshold. Indeed, no pulsed signal was found, but\nin the 17-25 keV band a DC signal was detected at the\n\u223c4 \u03c3 level. Moreover the fit of MECS+PDS spectra with\na power\u2013law plus a constant factor to take into account\nthe intercalibration uncertainties between the two instruments leads to a spectral index of 1.4 and to a value for\nthe constant \u223c8, well above the expected range of variability (0.7-1, Cusumano et al. 2000). Furthermore, the PDS\nlight curve shows that most of the source counts are concentrated in the first half of the observation. Therefore,\nit is likely that we observed a variable source in the large\nfield of view of the PDS collimators (1.\u25e6 3 \u00d7 1.\u25e6 3 FWHM).\nNote that there are several sources within a 3\u25e6 region in\nthe soft X-ray catalogs, but none in the hard X-ray ones.\n\nan X-ray efficiency of Lx /\u0116 = 4.8 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u0398 (d/5.7 kpc)2 )\nwhere \u0398 is the solid angle spanned by the emission beam.\nIt is moreover significantly greater than the spin-down energy loss rate. This inconsistency could be solved with the\nassumption that the emission spot covers a very small fraction, of the order of about 10\u22124 or even less, of the whole\ncap. The flux of heating particles should be then collimated within a very narrow angle of \u223c 00 .2 or smaller.\nFurthermore, the heating flux into the two polar caps must\nbe different to explain the spectral difference of the two\npeaks. A non\u2013thermal origin of the X-ray emission seems\ntherefore more convincing.\nThe variation of the peak ratio with energy recalls a\nsimilar effect observed for the Crab pulsar (see, for instance, the recent BeppoSAX data described by Mineo et\nal. 1997). The possibility of detecting such effect could\nbe due to a particular orientation among the rotation\nand magnetic axes and the line of sight. The Crab has\nan orthogonal alignment, however, Navarro et al. (1995),\non the basis of the radio pulse shape, inferred for PSR\nJ0218+4232 a nearly aligned rotator. The same conclusion is reached by Stairs et al. (1999) who analyzed highprecision, coherently-dispersed polarization profiles at the\ntwo frequencies of 410 and 610 MHz. Their Rotating Vector Model (RVM) fits support the classification of PSR\nJ0218+4232 as a nearly aligned rotator with magnetic inclination consistent with 00 , namely (8\u00b111) deg at 410\nMHz and (8\u00b115) at 610 MHz. Unfortunately, the impact\nangle parameters for their RVM fits have large uncertainties and therefore the line-of-sight inclination is unconstrained.\n\n6. Discussion\nThe BeppoSAX observation of PSR J0218+4232 provided\nthe first detection of pulsed emission from this millisecond\npulsar for energies up to 10 keV. The source shows a double peaked pulse shape with a remarkably flat (photon\nindex \u223c0.6) spectral distribution and indications that the\npeak intensity ratio depends on photon energy. In particular, the P2 peak, which is not prominent in the ROSAT\nlow energy phase histogram, becomes the dominant feature above 5 keV.\nOur fit for a black body spectrum gives the quite high\nvalue of 2.6 \u00d7 107 K for the temperature of the emitting\nregion. If we assume that the radiation comes from the\npulsar polar cap, heated, for instance, by the interactions\nwith starward moving high energy particles, we can compute the expected luminosity. The polar cap area of PSR\nJ0218+4232, defined as usualpby the open field lines, is of\nthe order of A \u2243 2\u03c0 R2 [1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 R \u03a9/c)] = 2.9 \u00d7 1011\ncm2 , where R is the stellar radius; from the Stefan's law\nwe obtain a bolometric luminosity of 5 \u00d7 1036 erg s\u22121 , a\nvalue that must be doubled if the other cap is taken into\naccount. Such luminosity is several orders of magnitude\nhigher than that derived from the phase averaged flux\nLx = 1.3 \u00d7 1032 \u0398 (d/5.7 kpc)2 erg s\u22121 (corresponding to\n\nFig. 5. The energy dependence of P2/P1, according to the\nphase interval defined in the text. The ROSAT point is indicated by a filled circle\n\n\fT. Mineo et al.: Pulse shape and spectrum of PSR J0218+4232 observed with BeppoSAX\n\nThe Crab-like double pulse X-ray profile of PSR\nJ0218+4232 and its hard non-thermal spectrum suggests\na common magnetospheric origin of the high-energy emission. The comparison with Crab is additionally enforced\nby the similar values of the magnetic field at the light\ncylinder, as already pointed out by Kuiper et al. (1998)\nand Kawai & Saito (1999). This follows directly from the\nclassical assumption that the pulsar braking is entirely\ndue to the Poynting flux at the light cylinder, independently of the actual structure of the magnetic field in the\nmagnetosphere:\nI 1 \u22125 1\n) 2 P 2 \u1e56 2 ,\n(2)\nc3\nwhere I is the moment of inertia. For the two pulsars we\nobtain then:\nBL \u2243 4\u03c0 2 (\n\nBL = BL,Cr (\n\nI 1 P \u2212 5 \u1e56 1\n)2 ,\n)2 (\n) 2(\nICr\nPCr\n\u1e56Cr\n\n(3)\n\n7\n\nthe gap over which the hard X-rays are produced should\nbe small. In fact, the very strong curvature of the magnetic\nfield lines would produce a broader pulse profile for a long\ngap. However, as Ho (1989) pointed out, strongly curved\nmagnetic field lines, as in millisecond pulsars, enhance the\nproduction of non-thermal emission, allowing outer gaps\nshorter than those of normal radio pulsars.\nAccording Kuiper et al. (1999), PSR J0218+4232 is\nthe most likely counterpart of the high-energy EGRET\nsource 2EG J0220+4232 / 3EG J0222+4253 for energies\nbetween 100 MeV and 1 GeV. This would suggest a cut-off\nenergy at least four orders of magnitude higher than the\nmaximum energy of 10 keV to which the BeppoSAX data\nshowed evidence for the detection of this source. Further\nhigh sensitivity observations at hard X-ray energies up to\nthe high-energy \u03b3-rays are therefore particularly relevant\nfor the understanding of the physics of this and other millisecond pulsars.\n\nwhere the suffix Cr is referred to Crab. Assuming that the\nmoments of inertia of the two pulsars are equal, we found\nBL \u2243 13 BL,Cr \u2243 3 \u00d7 105 Gauss.\nThe nature of the non-thermal mechanism responsible\nfor the X-ray emission is still unclear. A possibility is that\nX-ray photons are produced by curvature radiation from\nrelativistic electrons moving outwards along the field lines\nin proximity of the light cylinder. The Lorentz factor of\nthese particles to radiate photons of frequency \u03bd is given\nby\n4\u03c0 \u03bd\u03c1 1\n)3,\n(4)\n3 c\nwhere \u03c1 \u2243 c/(3\u03a9) is the curvature radius of the last closed\nline near the light cylinder in a dipole field. For \u03bd = 1018\nHz, corresponding to \u223c 4 keV, we have:\n\u03b3=(\n\n2\n1\n\u03b3 \u2243 ( \u03bdP ) 3 = 8 \u00d7 104 .\n(5)\n9\nThe radiative life time of the electrons is long enough to\nallow them to reach the light cylinder, namely:\n\u03c4c =\n\n9 \u03c1\nP\n\u03b3\n=\n= 2 \u00d7 1021 ,\n| d\u03b3/dt |\n8 \u03c0 re \u03bd\n\u03bd\n\n(6)\n\nwhere re is the classical radius of the electron; for P = 2.3\nms and \u03bd = 1018 Hz we have \u03c4c \u2243 5 s. These electrons\ncould be accelerated either in the outer gaps or above the\npolar caps. In the latter case, we expect that a copious\nnumber of electron-positron pairs will reach, after suffering radiation losses, the light cylinder with energy high\nenough for X-ray emission.\nAn origin of the high-energy X-rays in a narrow outer\ngap can also explain the narrow profile (intrinsically <\n0.04 phase; Kuiper et al. 1998) measured in the ROSAT\nlight curve, as well as the double peak profile, e.g. for\nthe wide fan-beam geometry proposed by Romani (1996).\nHowever, an additional constraint is needed: the length of\n\nFig. 6.
