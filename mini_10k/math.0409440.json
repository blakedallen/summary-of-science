Introduction\nA fundamental problem in knot theory is to classify knots and links by type, and\nseveral algebraic and geometric invariants have been developed with this goal in\nmind. Recently Swatee Naik and Ted Stanford have shown an equivalence between\nS-equivalence of knots, a purely algebraic invariant, and the doubled-delta move on\nknot diagrams, a purely geometric relation. They prove that two knots are related\nby a sequence of doubled-delta moves if and only if the knots are S-equivalent [NS].\nWe prove that the analogous connection for links between S-equivalence and the\ndoubled-delta move, posed as a question by Stavros Garoufalidis, is false.\nWe define a new invariant of ordered links called Strong S-equivalence that is\nin many ways better suited for links than the classical definition of S-equivalence.\nWith this new definition, we are able to prove a theorem analogous to Naik and\nStanford's result for links. Our main theorem also ties these results to the emerging\nsubject of clasper surgery, which has strong connections to the field of \"quantum\ntopology,\" an area of study that encompasses the Jones polynomials, Vassiliev invariants, and the Kontsevitch integral.\nMain Theorem. Consider two oriented, ordered m-component links L0 and L1 .\nThe following four statements are equivalent:\ni. L1 can be obtained from L0 through a sequence of doubled-delta moves.\nii. L0 and L1 are related by a sequence of Y -clasper surgeries, where each leaf\nof each clasper has total linking number zero with the link.\niii. L0 and L1 are Strongly S-equivalent.\niv. For some choice of Seifert Surfaces \u03a30 and \u03a31 and bases of H1 (\u03a3i ), L0 and\nL1 have identical ordered Seifert Matrices.\nThroughout the paper, a link L with m-components is a subset of S 3 , or of\nR , that consists of m disjoint, piecewise linear, simple closed curves (a link with\none component is a knot ). Unless otherwise noted, all links will be oriented and\n3\n\nDate: September 20, 2004.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nCAROL GWOSDZ GEE\n\nordered. Seifert surfaces for links will be required to be connected, and g will\ndenote the minimal genus among possible Seifert surfaces.\n2. The Doubled-Delta Move\nThe Delta Move. Before defining the doubled-delta move, we look first at the\nsimpler (single) delta move. The delta move shown in Figure 1 is a particular move\non knot or link diagrams. Given a link containing the tangle in Figure 1a, replace\nthe tangle with that of Figure 1b in such a way that respects the free ends.\n\nFigure 1. The Delta Move\nIt is clear that the delta move preserves the pairwise linking numbers of the\ncomponents, since for each pair of strands, the move changes neither the crossing\nnor the orientation. Though less obvious, the converse is also true, as proved by\nMurakami and Nakanishi in [MN]: two links have the same sets of pairwise linking\nnumbers if and only if they are equivalent under delta moves. Since a knot is a\none-component link, it follows that any two knots are equivalent under delta moves.\nThe Doubled-Delta Move. The doubled-delta move is similar to the single delta\nmove, with each of the three strands being replaced by a pair of oppositely oriented\nstrands. The link components that comprise the six affected strands are irrelevant.\nThe doubled-delta move is more restrictive than the (single) delta move, but it still\npreserves the pairwise linking numbers.\n\nFigure 2. The Doubled-Delta Move\nBorromean Surgery. The delta move and doubled-delta move partition knots\nand links into equivalence classes. Two links are said to be in the same class\nif they are related by a sequence of such moves. However, unlike many of the\nbasic moves that change a knot or link diagram, the delta and doubled-delta move\nare closely related to other operations used by topologists in a variety of contexts.\n\n\fSTRONG S-EQUIVALENCE OF ORDERED LINKS\n\n3\n\nIn Figure 3, we see that the effect of the delta move is the same as \"adding in\"\nBorromean rings.\n\nFigure 3. The Delta-Move is Borromean Surgery\nAnother name for the operation depicted in the figure is Borromean (or Borromeo) surgery.\nWe will see in Section 3 how Borromean surgery relates to\nclaspers, and thus to grope cobordisms, finite-type invariants, and other ideas of\nlow-dimensional topology.\n3. Claspers\nUnder what conditions are two links related by a sequence of doubled-delta\nmoves? This question is interesting to many topologists in the context of clasper\nsurgery, a special case of which is Borromean surgery. Claspers were first defined by K. Habiro [H], where they arose in the context of finite-type invariants.\nHabiro demonstrated how the theory of claspers provides an alternative calculus\nunder which one can study finite-type invariants of knots and 3-manifolds. Claspers\nalso were implicit in the work of Goussarov [Gu1][Gu2]. Today, they are studied\nacross various fields of low-dimensional topology. In addition to applications of\nfinite-type invariants, P. Teichner and J. Conant examine claspers' relationships to\ngrope cobordisms [CT], and S. Garoufalidis uses clasper surgery [GL] to better\nunderstand the Kontsevich integral and concordance classes of knots.\nDefinition. A clasper is a compact surface constructed from the following three\ntypes of pieces:\n\u2022 edges, or bands that connect the other two types of pieces\n\u2022 nodes, or disks with three incident edges\n\u2022 leaves, or annuli with one incident edge.\nThe annuli that comprise the leaves may be twisted with any number of full\ntwists. We call this number the framing of the leaf. Figure 4a shows a clasper\nwith zero-framed leaves.\nClasper Surgery. Assume that a clasper C is embedded in a 3-manifold M . To\ndo surgery on the clasper means to remove a handlebody neighborhood of the\nclasper from a 3-manifold M 3 , and glue it back in a prescribed way according to\nthe clasper and its framing. In particular, we associate a link LC to the clasper\nC as in Figure 4b using the following substitutions: each node of the clasper is\nreplaced by a copy of the positive, zero-framed Borromean rings, and each edge is\nreplaced by a positive Hopf link. Leaves of the clasper do not contribute additional\nlink components, but the framing of a leaf does determine the framing of the Hopf\nlink component corresponding to that leaf's adjacent edge. Clasper surgery, then,\nis really integer surgery on the associated framed link.\n\n\f4\n\nCAROL GWOSDZ GEE\n\nFigure 4. A Y -clasper, with its associated link.\n\nAn important property of clasper surgery is that it preserves the homology of\nthe affected manifold. When each leaf of the clasper \"clasps\" a knot or link and\nat least one leaf bounds a disk in M 3 \u2212 clasper, the result of the surgery is a new\nknot or link in the same 3-manifold.\nSurgery on the simplest clasper\u2013the strut, with a single edge and two leaves\u2013\ncan accomplish a single crossing change in the original knot. Since the crossing\nchange is an unknotting relation, all knots are related by strut-clasper surgery. The\nsimplest interesting clasper, then, is the Y -clasper. One may also argue that the\nY -clasper is the most interesting clasper, since any larger clasper may be realized as\nseveral Y -claspers by expanding edges of the larger clasper into Hopf-linked pairs\nof leaves [H].\n\nNull Claspers. In [GR], S. Garoufalidis and L. Rozansky discuss null claspers,\nthose whose leaves are null-homologous links in M \u2212K for a 3-manifold M and knot\nK. Such leaves are sent to zero under the map \u03c01 (M \u2212 K) \u2192 H1 (M \u2212 K) \u223c\n= Z; in\nother words, each leaf has algebraic linking number zero with the knot. Garoufalidis\nand Rozansky explain that null claspers have been used to demonstrate a rational\nversion of the Kontsevich integral and can be used to define a notion of finitetype invariants. In Lemma 1.3 of [GR], they show that surgery on null claspers\npreserves not only the homology of a knot complement, but also the Alexander\nmodule and Blanchfield linking form. Furthermore, null clasper surgery describes\na move on the set of knots in integral homology spheres that directly corresponds\nto the doubled-delta move.\nExtending Garoufalidis's and Rozansky's definition to links, for the pair (M, L),\nwhere M is a 3-manifold and L is a link, a null clasper would be one whose leaves\nhave linking number zero with each component. Unfortunately, the doubled-delta\nmove acts on the strands of a link independently of the link components. Therefore,\nin considering the relationship between claspers and the doubled-delta move, our\ninterest is with a slightly larger class of claspers: those in which each leaf clasps\nseveral strands of the link in such a way that the total linking number with all link\ncomponents is zero.\nWe claim that when the leaves of a zero-framed Y -clasper each have total linking\nnumber zero with the link, the Y -clasper surgery has the same effect on the link\nas a finite sequence of doubled-delta moves, as well as that of Borromean surgery.\nThis is one of the implications of our main theorem, and is illustrated in Figure 10.\n\n\fSTRONG S-EQUIVALENCE OF ORDERED LINKS\n\n5\n\n4. S-equivalence and the Doubled-Delta Move\nThe Seifert Matrix. Many of the basic algebraic invariants of knot theory, including the Alexander module, the Conway polynomial, and the signature, depend\nonly on the Seifert matrix of a knot or link, which is readily computable but not\nuniquely defined.\nFor every m-component link L in S 3 , there is a Seifert surface \u03a3 associated to\nthe link, where \u03a3 is a connected, oriented, embedded surface with the components\nof L as its boundary. Given a basis {bi } of H1 (\u03a3), we can associate a Seifert matrix\nM to the link L, where the entries of M are defined from the linking number of\n+\ntwo basis elements. In particular, Mi,j = lk(bi , b+\nj ), where bj is a pushoff of bj in\nthe positive normal direction.\nClassical S-equivalence. S-equivalence is a notion that has been widely considered for both knots and links [Go] [K] [Li]. Two square integral matrices M\nand N are said to be S-equivalent if M can be transformed into N by a finite\nsequence of integral congruences (that is, M = At N A for some integral matrix A\nwith det(A) = \u00b11) and row or column enlargements/reductions of the form\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n|\n|\n|\n|\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nM\ny t 0\uf8f7\nM\ny t 0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n|\n|\uf8f7\n|\n| \uf8f7 or N = \uf8ec\nN =\uf8ec\n\uf8f7.\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\uf8ed- \u2212\n\uf8ed- \u2212\nx - z 1\uf8f8\nx - z 0\uf8f8\n- 0 - 0 0\n- 0 - 1 0\nA more precise statement of these definitions is given in section 5. Up to Sequivalence, Seifert matrices are well-defined for knots and links.\nRelationship to the Doubled-Delta Move. Despite being a purely algebraic\nrelation, S-equivalence has geometric implications for knots. In particular, S.\nNaik and T. Stanford prove that two knots are S-equivalent if and only if they are\nequivalent by a sequence of doubled-delta moves [NS].\nOne might assume that a similar statement should be true of links. Is the\nS-equivalence of two links enough to guarantee that they are equivalent under a\nsequence of doubled-delta moves? This question was posed by Stavros Garoufalidis\nin the context of clasper surgery, and given that all the definitions leading up to Sequivalence are the same for links as they are for knots, it seems that the analogous\nproof for links should follow in a straightforward fashion from the proof of NaikStanford. The question seems plausible, but in fact it is false. We prove by\ncounterexample in Proposition 4.1 that two S-equivalent links are not necessarily\nrelated by a sequence of doubled-delta moves.\nProposition 4.1. S-equivalence is not a sufficient condition for two links to be\nrelated by a sequence of doubled-delta moves.\nProof. The two links L0 and L1 depicted in figure 5 are S-equivalent but not related\nby a sequence of doubled delta moves. Note that the pairwise linking numbers of\nthe first link are {\u22121, 2, 2} while for the second link they are {1, 0, 0}. Since the\ndoubled-delta move preserves pairwise linking numbers, these two links cannot be\nrelated by doubled-delta moves.\nThe fact that the two links are S-equivalent can be seen by choosing Seifert Surfaces as in figure 6, with bases {a, b} and {c, d}. Each of the surfaces can be viewed\n\n\f6\n\nCAROL GWOSDZ GEE\n\nFigure 5. Two 3-component Links\n\nFigure 6.

The\nmatrix A = ( 10 11 ) satisfies the condition At M1 A = M0 , demonstrating that the two\nlinks are in fact S-equivalent.\n\u0003\nFinding the sufficient conditions to extend the Naik-Stanford theorem will require\nsome new definitions, treated in section 5.\n5. Strong S-equivalence\nAs shown in Proposition 4.1, the classical definition of S-equivalence is inadequate for the proof of our main theorem, and actually it seems inappropriate for\nlinks in many contexts. Treating a link as a disjoint knot, S-equivalence regards\nthe entire link as a whole, without reference to the individual components. Strong\nS-equivalence, defined below, better respects the boundary components of a Seifert\nsurface, and hence the components of the link.\nLet L = {L1 , L2 , ..., Lm } be an oriented, ordered link in S 3 . Let \u03a3 be a Seifert\nsurface for L with m boundary components, and let g denote the genus of \u03a3.\nThat is, \u03a3 \u2286 S 3 is an oriented surface with \u2202\u03a3 = L.

Define the Seifert pairing \u03c3(a, b) = lk(a, b+ ), where b+ is a\npushoff of b in the positive normal direction. We introduce the following term:\nDefinition.

We say two integral square matrices V and W are congruent if V =\nP t W P for some integral matrix P with det(P ) = \u00b11.\nDefinition. For integral square matrices V and W , we say that W is an enlargement of V , or V is a reduction of W if\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nW =\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed-\n-\n\nV\n\u2212\n\u2192\nx -\n0 -\n\n|\n\u2212\n\u2192\nyt\n|\nz\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n|\n0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n|\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n1\uf8f8\n0\n\n\uf8eb\n\nor\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nW =\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed-\n-\n\nV\n\u2212\n\u2192\nx -\n0 -\n\n|\n\u2212\n\u2192\nyt\n|\nz\n1\n\n\uf8f6\n|\n0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n|\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n0\uf8f8\n0\n\nWith a slight modification of these two definitions, we introduce:\nDefinition. Two matrices V and W are Strongly S-equivalent if V is equivalent\nto W under a finite sequence of\n\u2022 Congruences (\u223c\n=) that fix the upper-left (m\u22121)\u00d7(m\u22121) block of the matrix.\nThat is, there exists an integral matrix A = ( I0 \u2217\u2217 ), so that At V A = W and\ndet(A) = \u00b11, where I is the (m \u2212 1) \u00d7 (m \u2212 1) identity matrix.\n\n\f8\n\nCAROL GWOSDZ GEE\n\n\u2022 Enlargements (\u0580) and reductions (\u0581) where the first (m \u2212 1) elements of\n\u2192\n\u2192\nthe vectors \u2212\nx and \u2212\ny are equal, and where the reduced matrix V is n \u00d7 n\nfor n \u2265 m \u2212 1.\nNote that reductions should not be allowed to reduce the size of the matrix\nsmaller than (m \u2212 1) \u00d7 (m \u2212 1), for in the case of Seifert matrices, this would\neffectively eliminate link components.\n\u2192\n\u2192\nAlso note that the first (m\u22121) elements of the vectors \u2212\nx and \u2212\ny are equal because\nt\nthese entries should be zero in the intersection form W \u2212 W of the enlarged matrix\nW , since boundary components will not intersect any other basis elements.\nDefinition. We say that two links L and L\u2032 are Strongly S-equivalent if, for some\nchoice of Seifert surfaces and ordered bases, L and L\u2032 have ordered Seifert matrices\nM and M \u2032 that are Strongly S-equivalent .\nOne might object that Strong S-equivalence imposes the \"restriction\" that V and\nW agree on their upper-left (m \u2212 1) \u00d7 (m \u2212 1) blocks. However, since homeomorphisms of \u03a3 from the pure mapping class group preserve the boundary components\npointwise, any change of basis of M must fix the l1 , l2 , ...lm\u22121 basis elements. With\nStrong S-equivalence, we're not \"restricting\" our definition so much as respecting\nthe boundary components of a link.\nDisk-Band Form of the Seifert Surface. It will often be useful to look at the\nSeifert surface in disk-band form. Any Seifert surface for a link is homeomorphic\nto a disk with 2g + m \u2212 1 bands attached; more importantly, we can always isotope\nour surface to one in disk-band form as in Figure 7, with 2g bands interlaced in\npairs and m \u2212 1 non-interlaced bands. Within the dotted box, the bands of our\n\nFigure 7. Disk-Band Form for a Link's Seifert Surface\nsurface form a string link, i.e. they may be knotted, twisted, or intertwined as long\nas the bands entering the top of the box match up with those that leave the bottom\nof the box. With the surface in this form, there is an natural choice for a basis {bi }\nof H1 (\u03a3), with one basis element running through each of the bands. The first\nm \u2212 1 non-interlacing bands yield basis elements that are pushoffs of the respective\nboundary components and have no intersection with any other basis elements. The\n2g interlaced bands yield basis elements with the properties of a symplectic basis,\ng\n\u0001\nL\n0 \u22121\ni.e. one whose intersection form Vi,j = hbi , bj i is the block sum\n1 0 . We coin\nj=1\n\n\fSTRONG S-EQUIVALENCE OF ORDERED LINKS\n\n9\n\nthe term semi-symplectic to refer to this natural choice of basis. A semi-symplectic\nbasis is an ordered basis, but the converse is not necessarily true.\nProperties of Strong S-equivalence.\nProposition 5.2. Pairwise linking number is an invariant of Strong S-equivalence.\nProof. If two links L and L\u2032 are Strongly S-equivalent then, regardless of the choice\nof ordered Seifert matrices M and M \u2032 , the upper left (m \u2212 1) \u00d7 (m \u2212 1) blocks of\nM and M \u2032 will necessarily agree. That is, for i 6= j, 1 \u2264 i, j < m,\n\u2032\nlk(Li , Lj ) = Mi,j = Mi,j\n= lk(L\u2032i , L\u2032j ).\n\nFurthermore, by property i. of Remark 5.1,\nlk(Li , Lm ) = \u2212\n\nm\u22121\nX\n\nMi,j = \u2212\n\nj=1\n\nm\u22121\nX\n\n\u2032\nMi,j\n= lk(L\u2032i , L\u2032m ).\n\nj=1\n\nThus all the pairwise linking numbers for L agree with those for L\u2032 .\n\n\u0003\n\nProposition 5.3. Any two ordered Seifert matrices for an oriented ordered link L\nare Strongly S-equivalent.\nProof. Let M1 and M2 be two ordered Seifert matrices for L with respect to Seifert\nsurfaces \u03a31 and \u03a32 and bases \u03b21 and \u03b22 .\nBy Lemma 5.2.4 of [K], any two connected Seifert surfaces \u03a31 and \u03a32 of a\nlink L are ambient isotopic after modifying them by a finite sequence of 1-handle\nf1 and \u03a3\nf2\nenlargements. In other words, there are two ambient isotopic surfaces \u03a3\nfi is the result of several 1-handle enlargements of \u03a3i . Without loss\nsuch that \u03a3\nc2 is\nof generality, we can consider just the following case: suppose some surface \u03a3\nc\nambient isotopic to \u03a31 , a single 1-handle enlargement of \u03a31 . Let a2 be a meridian\n(technically, the belt sphere) of the 1-handle and choose a closed curve a1 that\nintersects the meridinal disk (technically, the co-core) exactly once. Then one of\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\nM1\n\uf8ec\nc1 = \uf8ec\nM\n\uf8ec\n\u2192\n\uf8ed- \u2212\nx\n- 0\n\n|\n\u2212\n\u2192\nyt\n|\n- z\n- 0\n\n\uf8f6\n|\n0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n|\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n1\uf8f8\n0\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\nM1\n\uf8ec\nor M1 = \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\u2192\n\uf8ed- \u2212\nx\n- 0\n\n|\n\u2192\n\u2212\nyt\n|\n- z\n- 1\n\n\uf8f6\n|\n0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n|\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0\uf8f8\n0\n\nc1 with respect to the basis \u03b21 \u222a {a1 , a2 } for H1 (\u03a3\nc1 ). The\nis a Seifert matrix for \u03a3\nc1 , corresponds to a 1-handle attached so that its core lies\nmatrix on the left, M\non the negative side of the surface, while M1 corresponds to a 1-handle with its\nc1 case and note\ncore on the positive side of the surface. We will treat only the M\nc1 come from\nthat the M1 case follows similarly. The zeros in the last column of M\nthe fact that a positive pushoff of the meridian, a2 , will not link any of the basis\nc1 is all zero because a negative pushoff of\nelements except a1 . The last row of M\nthe meridian a2 will not link any of the basis elements. Since for any Seifert matrix\n\u2192\n\u2192\nN , N \u2212 N t is an intersection form, the first m \u2212 1 entries of the vectors \u2212\nx and \u2212\ny\nmust be equal. Otherwise a1 would be intersecting a boundary component, which\n\u2192\n\u2192\nis impossible. The rest of the entries of \u2212\nx and \u2212\ny are freely determined by the\nparticular embedding of the new 1-handle and the choice of curve a1 , as always\nwith Mi,j = lk(\u03b2i , \u03b2j+ ). The entry z is, of course, lk(a1 , a+\n1 ). Note that with more\n\n\f10\n\nCAROL GWOSDZ GEE\n\n\u2192\n\u2192\nrestrictions on the choice of a1 , the allowable entries of \u2212\nx, \u2212\ny , and z could be given\nmore structure.\nc1 and M1 are Strongly SBy the definitions of enlargement and reduction, M\nequivalent.

By transitivity, M1 is Strongly S-equivalent\nto M2 .\n\u0003\nLike its classical S-equivalence analogue, the converse of Proposition 5.3 is not\ntrue. If N is a Seifert matrix for the link L with respect to Seifert surface \u03a3, and\nM is Strongly S-equivalent to N , M is not necessarily a Seifert matrix for L. The\ndifficulty arises when M is a reduction of N , since it may not be possible to find\na corresponding 1-handle reduction of the Seifert surface \u03a3. The converse is true,\nhowever, in the special cases of congruences and enlargements. Matrix congruence\ncorresponds to change of basis for widecheckH1 (\u03a3). In order to explicitly understand how any given matrix enlargement corresponds to a 1-handle enlargement of\na Seifert surface, we prove the following proposition:\nProposition 5.4. If N is an ordered Seifert matrix for the link L with respect to\nSeifert surface \u03a3, and M is an enlargement of N , then M is an ordered Seifert\nb of \u03a3.\nmatrix for L with respect to a 1-handle enlargement \u03a3\nProof. Let \u03a3 be a Seifert surface for L with basis \u03b2 of H1 (\u03a3) that induces the\nb of \u03a3 that has M\nSeifert matrix N . We will construct the 1-handle enlargement \u03a3\nas its Seifert matrix, where either\n\uf8eb\n\n|\n\u2192\n\u2212\nt\n\uf8ec\nN\ny\n\uf8ec\n|\nM =\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\u2192\n\uf8ed- \u2212\nx - z\n- 0 - 0\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n|\n|\n\u2212\n\u2192\nt\n\uf8ec\n0\uf8f7\nN\ny\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n|\uf8f7\n|\n\uf8f7 or M = \uf8ec\n\u2212\n\uf8ed- \u2192\n1\uf8f8\nx - z\n0\n- 0 - 1\n\n\uf8f6\n|\n0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n|\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n0\uf8f8\n0\n\nAs in Proposition 5.3, the matrix on the left corresponds to attaching the 1handle so that its core lies on the negative side of the surface, while the matrix on\nthe right corresponds to a 1-handle with its core on the positive side of the surface.\nLet {b1 , . . . , b2g+m\u22121 } \u2282 \u03a3 be a set of representative curves for the basis \u03b2. Find\ntwo small disks in \u03a3 that are disjoint from the curves {b1 , . . . , b2g+m\u22121 }. These\ndisks will be the attaching region for the 1-handle. Designate two points, p and\nq, one point on the boundary of each disk. The enlarged matrix M determines\nthe Seifert form\u2013that is, a combination of linking and intersection numbers\u2013of two\nnew basis elements a1 and a2 with curves {b1 , . . . , b2g+m\u22121 }. The 1-handle we\nconstruct will have a2 as a meridian and a1 running parallel to the core. First\nlet us construct a1 , breaking it into two parts, \u03b3 and \u03b4, as in figure 8. In order to\nbe consistent with the Seifert matrix M , we need a1 to to intersect and link the\n\n\fSTRONG S-EQUIVALENCE OF ORDERED LINKS\n\n11\n\n\u2192\n\u2192\ncurves {b1 , . . . , b2g+m\u22121 } according to the entries of the vectors \u2212\nx and \u2212\ny . We\ncan extract the intersection information from the intersection form M \u2212 M t , or in\n\u2192\n\u2192\nparticular, from the vector entries \u2212\nxi \u2212 \u2212\nyi [R]. Running through the surface \u03a3,\n\u03b3 will be constructed to take care of any intersections, while the handle itself, and\nhence \u03b4, will be free to link the basis elements. Together, \u03b3 \u222a \u03b4 = a1 will then\n+\nsatisfy each of the entries lk(a1 , b+\ni ) = xi and lk(bi , a1 ) = yi .\n\nFigure 8. 1-handle\nTo find \u03b3 \u2282 \u03a3, the half of a1 that will travel from p to q along the surface \u03a3, let us\n\u2192\n\u2192\nlook at the intersection form M \u2212 M t . The individual entries of \u2212\nx \u2212\u2212\ny determine\nhow \u03b3 should intersect the curves {b1 , . . . , b2g+m\u22121 }; since \u03b4 \u2282 a1 does not intersect\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u03b2 at all, h\u03b3, bi i = ha1 , bi i = \u2212\nxi \u2212 \u2212\nyi . The first m \u2212 1 entries of \u2212\nx \u2212\u2212\ny are zero,\nwhich is consistent with the fact that \u03b3 cannot cross a boundary component. For\n\u2192\n\u2192\nthe last 2g curves bi , choose \u03b3 so that h\u03b3, bi i = \u2212\nxi \u2212 \u2212\nyi . This is possible. As\ndescribed previously, the basis \u03b2 is in correspondence with a semi-symplectic basis.\nFor ease of construction, choose a set of curves {ci } in \u03a3 to be representatives of\nthis semi-symplectic basis with the same (semi-symplectic) algebraic intersection\nproperties. If, for any set of integers {ki }, we can construct a curve \u03b3 that has\nalgebraic intersection number ki with each ci , then the same can be done for the\nset of curves {bi } via this correspondence. Start with a curve \u03b31 from p to q that\ndoes not intersect any of the curves ci . For each desired (\u00b1) intersection with a\nparticular curve c2k , take \u03b32 = \u03b31 \u00b1 c2k\u22121 . (For each (\u00b1) intersection with c2k\u22121 ,\ntake \u03b32 = \u03b31 \u2213 c2k .) Continue this until all intersections are achieved, and call the\nfinal curve \u03b3. Figure 9, below, demonstrates how a path \u03b3 from p to q can be\nchosen to intersect c1 exactly one time and intersect c4 exactly \u22122 times.\nAfter the intersection properties are established between \u03b3 and the bi , we shift\nour focus to the linking properties. As with the intersections, the linking numbers\nof \u03b3 with the bi are in correspondence with those of \u03b3 with the ci , so we will focus\nour construction on the semi-symplectic basis {ci }. The core of the 1-handle can\nbe chosen in the complement of \u03a3 so that it links each of the curves ci the desired\nnumber of times. This is easy to see in the disk-band representation of \u03a3. The\ncore can then be fattened up to a solid handle, the surface of which is the 1-handle\nenlargement of \u03a3. We choose a curve \u03b4 on the surface of the handle parallel to the\ncore, and let a1 = \u03b3 + \u03b4 be one of our new basis elements. Figure 9 demonstrates\nhow the core can be chosen to link c2 one time and link c3 negative one time.\nLastly, we must adjust the path \u03b4 along the 1-handle so that lk(a1 , a+\n1 ) = z.\nThe remedy is simple: each repeated positive or negative full twist to the 1-handle\n\n\f12\n\nCAROL GWOSDZ GEE\n\nFigure 9. Construction of 1-handle\nwill increase or decrease lk(a1 , a+\n1 ) by one without affecting any of the other basis\nelements. Figure 9 illustrates \u03b4 chosen so that z = \u22122.\nb for L and a new basis\nWe have explicitly constructed a new Seifert surface \u03a3\nb such that M is an ordered Seifert matrix for L with respect\n{\u03b2, a1 , a2 } for H1 (\u03a3)\nto them.\n\u0003\n6. Proof of the Main Theorem\nTheorem 6.1. Consider two oriented, ordered m-component links L0 and L1 . The\nfollowing four statements are equivalent:\ni. L1 can be obtained from L0 through a sequence of doubled-delta moves.\nii. L0 and L1 are related by a sequence of Y -clasper surgeries, where each clasper\nhas total linking number zero with the link.\niii. L0 and L1 are Strongly S-equivalent.\niv. For some choice of Seifert Surfaces \u03a30 and \u03a31 and bases of H1 (\u03a3i ), L0 and\nL1 have the same ordered Seifert Matrix.\nThe proofs of each implication i. =\u21d2 ii. =\u21d2 iii. =\u21d2 iv. =\u21d2 i. are treated\nindividually below:\nProof of i. =\u21d2 ii..\nProof. Doubled-delta moves correspond to \"Borromean surgery,\" which is exactly\nthe effect of Y -clasper surgery, where each leaf clasps pairs of oppositely oriented\nstrands. This is depicted in figure 10. In this figure, the relationship a introduces\nthe desired Y -clasper, b transforms the clasper into its associated link, c depicts the\neffect of surgery via handle slide moves, d is merely the second Reidemeister move,\nand e is the doubled-delta move.\n\u0003\nProof of ii. =\u21d2 iii.. We actually prove a stronger implication than claimed in\nthe theorem, namely that the clasper surgery described in ii. does not alter the\nordered Seifert matrix.\n\n\fSTRONG S-EQUIVALENCE OF ORDERED LINKS\n\n13\n\nFigure 10. Y -Clasper surgery is Doubled-Delta Move\nProof. Consider a neighborhood of the clasp, as in Figure 11a. There are 2k\nstrands passing through the leaf, with k in each direction. We can assume the\nstrands' directions alternate within this neighborhood. If they do not alternate,\nwe can permute the strands by introducing inverse braids just above and below the\n2k braid in question.\n\nFigure 11. Enlarged View of Clasper Leaf\nTemporarily cut the strands at the neighborhood's boundary and fill in the alternating arcs to get bands as in Figure 11b. Outside the neighborhood, apply\nSeifert's algorithm to the resulting link. Then reattach the new bands at the neighborhood's boundary to obtain a Seifert surface for the original link where the leaf\nof the clasper grabs k bands of the Seifert surface.\n\n\f14\n\nCAROL GWOSDZ GEE\n\nNow clasper surgery is equivalent to tying these bands into Borromean rings,\nwhich doesn't affect the linking of the bands or strands. If a basis element of\nH1 (\u03a3) runs through a band, its pairwise linking with the other basis elements is\nunchanged; if not, it is completely unaffected by the surgery. Thus the clasper\nsurgery leaves the Seifert matrix unchanged.\n\u0003\nProof of iii. =\u21d2 iv.. With almost no alteration, the proof of iii. =\u21d2 iv. can\nalso be used to show that two classically S-equivalent knots or links have a Seifert\nmatrix in common.\nProof. If L and L\u2032 are Strongly S-equivalent then, by definition, there are Seifert\nmatrices M and M \u2032 respectively such that M is equivalent to M \u2032 under a finite\nsequence of enlargements (\u0580), reductions (\u0581), and congruences (\u223c\n=). For example,\nwe can write a sequence of the form\n(\u2217)\nM \u0581 M1 \u0580 M2 \u223c\n= M5 \u0580 M6 \u0581 M \u2032 .\n= M3 \u0581 M4 \u223c\nIn order to prove that L and L\u2032 have a Seifert matrix in common, it will be helpful\nto rewrite the sequence (\u2217) so that all the enlargements precede all the reductions,\nas in\nc6 \u0581 M\nc7 \u0581 M\nc8 \u223c\nc4 \u0580 M\nc5 \u223c\nc2 \u0580 M\nc3 \u223c\nc1 \u223c\n(\u2217\u2217)\nM \u0580M\n= M \u2032.\n=M\n=M\n=M\n\nThe following lemmas establish that such an ordered sequence (\u2217\u2217) exists for every\npair of strongly S-equivalent matrices and show how the ordered sequence completes\nthe proof of iii. =\u21d2 iv..\nLemma 6.2.

Any sequence of relations between Strongly S-equivalent matrices can\nbe rewritten so that all enlargements come before all reductions, as in the sequence\n(\u2217\u2217).\nProof. The proof of Lemma 6.4 follows from an induction argument using Lemmas\n6.2 and 6.3. For simplicity, we will use strings of the symbols {\u0580, \u0581, \u223c\n=} to denote\nenlargements, reductions, and congruences, respectively, while omitting explicit\nreference to the matrices.\n\u2022 Base Case: \u0581 \u0580 =\u21d2 \u0580 \u223c\n= \u0581 (Lemma 6.2).\n\u2022 Inductive Step: Find the first enlargement that is preceded by a reduction.\nNote that the sequence preceding this enlargement is arranged as desired.\nThere are two cases:\n(1) If this enlargement is immediately preceded by a congruence, apply\nLemma 6.3 to replace \u223c\n= \u0580 with \u0580 \u223c\n=. Repeat Lemma 6.3 until the\nenlargement is immediately preceded by a reduction.\n(2) If this enlargement is immediately preceded by a reduction, then by\nLemma 6.2, \u0581 \u0580 can be replaced with \u0580 \u223c\n= \u0581.\nContinue the two steps above until the enlargement is immediately preceded by another enlargement.\nWe have reduced the number of out-of-order {\u0580, \u0581, \u223c\n=} by one without increasing the number of enlargements or reductions. Continue the inductive step until\nthere is no enlargement preceded by a reduction.\n\u0003\nWe can now finish the proof of iii. =\u21d2 iv.. If L and L\u2032 are Strongly Sequivalent, then by Lemma 6.4 we may assume there exists a sequence of relations\n(\u0580, \u0581, \u223c\n=) between M and M \u2032 where all enlargements precede all reductions. Note\nthat:\n\u2022 If M is an ordered Seifert matrix for the link L with respect to Seifert surface\n\u03a3 and basis \u03b2, and if M \u0580 M \u2032 , then M \u2032 is also an ordered Seifert matrix\nb of \u03a3 and the corresponding\nfor L with respect to a 1-handle enlargement \u03a3\nnew basis \u03b2 \u222a {a1 , a2 }. This follows from Proposition 5.4.\n\u2022 If M is an ordered Seifert matrix for the link L, and M \u223c\n= M \u2032 , then M \u2032\nis also an ordered Seifert matrix for L, with respect to the same Seifert\nsurface and a new basis as prescribed by the congruence.\nUsing the two facts above, we can \"work inwards\" from both ends of the ordered sequence to show that L and L\u2032 have a common Seifert matrix (though not\nnecessarily M or M \u2032 ) for some Seifert surfaces and bases. Starting with M and\nworking from left to right, each enlargement or congruence yields a new Seifert\nmatrix for L. This terminates when we reach the first reduction. Similarly, since\nMi \u0581 M \u2032 \u21d0\u21d2 M \u2032 \u0580 Mi , starting with M \u2032 and working from right to left, each\nreduction or congruence yields a new Seifert matrix for L\u2032 .

The following proposition contains the bulk of content of the\nMain Theorem. This is the primary step that distinguishes the proof of iv. =\u21d2 i.\nfrom Naik-Stanford's proof and uses the extra hypotheses of Strong S-equivalence:\nProposition 6.5. If two m-component links L0 and L1 have the same ordered\nSeifert matrix M with respect to Seifert surfaces \u03a30 and \u03a31 and ordered bases \u03b20\nand \u03b21 of H1 (\u03a30 ) and H1 (\u03a31 ), respectively, then it is possible to arrange \u03a30 and\n\n\fSTRONG S-EQUIVALENCE OF ORDERED LINKS\n\n17\n\n\u03a31 into disk-band form and to find new semi-symplectic bases \u03b30 and \u03b31 for \u03a30 and\n\u03a31 that give rise to a new shared ordered Seifert matrix N for both L0 and L1 .\nProof of Proposition. We start with surfaces \u03a30 and \u03a31 and bases \u03b20 and \u03b21 of\nH1 (\u03a30 ) and H1 (\u03a31 ), respectively. In transforming \u03a30 and \u03a31 into disk-band form,\nit is important that we keep track of the new semi-symplectic bases \u03b30 and \u03b31 in\nterms \u03b20 and \u03b21 . This means understanding the homeomorphisms involved in the\ntransformation.\nBoth \u03a30 and \u03a31 have m boundary components, and since they share an ordered\nSeifert matrix, both have the same genus, say g. Let Fg be an abstract surface\nof genus g with m boundary components, specifically realized as a disk with bands\nas in Figure 12 (i.e. the string link from Figure 7 is trivial), where the {ai } form\n\nFigure 12. The surface Fg\nan ordered basis for H1 (Fg ). The intersection form for {ai } is represented by the\ng\n\u0001\n\u0001\nL\n0\n0 \u22121\nblock matrix X = 00 Sym\n, where Sym =\n1 0 .\nj=1\n\nChoose orientation-preserving homeomorphisms \u03a6i : Fg \u2192 \u03a3i from the pure\nmapping class group, i.e. the boundary components are fixed, pointwise. Assume\nthat the boundary component of Fg that is parallel to aj is sent by \u03a6i to the jth\ncomponent of Li . Then\n\u03a6i ({ai }) = {\u03a6i (a1 ), . . . , \u03a6i (am\u22121+2g )}\n= {\u03b2i,1 , \u03b2i,2 , . . . , \u03b2i,m\u22121 , \u03a6i (am ), . . . , \u03a6i (am\u22121+2g )}\nis also a basis for H1 (\u03a3i ). So there exist invertible matrices Ai = ( I0 \u2217\u2217 ) such that\nNi = Ati M Ai denote the ordered Seifert matrices of \u03a3i with respect to the new\nbases \u03a6i ({ai }). These homeomorphisms describe an explicit way to put \u03a30 and\n\u03a31 into disk band form as in Figure 7, where the two surfaces differ only by string\nlinks \u039b0 , \u039b1 of bands of the Seifert surfaces. The new ordered Seifert matrices\nN0 and N1 correspond to these \"new\" surfaces, but N0 6= N1 . In the construction\nprocess we lost the critical hypothesis that the ordered Seifert matrices for L0 and\nL1 were equal. We need to show that N0 is also an ordered Seifert matrix for \u03a31 ,\nwith respect to a different basis.\nBy definition, if we have a Seifert matrix N determined by a given basis, then\nN \u2212 N t is the intersection form for that same basis. Since homeomorphisms of\nsurfaces preserve the intersection properties of their basis elements, \u03a6i ({ai }) will\nhave the same\nthat Ni \u2212 Nit =\n\u0001 intersection properties as {ai }, and thus we have\n\u22121\n0 0\nX = 0 Sym . Using this fact, we construct a matrix C = A1 A0 that we show\n\n\f18\n\nCAROL GWOSDZ GEE\n\nstabilizes X, in that X = C t XC. First we show that N0 = C t N1 C:\nN0\n\n= At0 M A0\n= At0 ((At1 )\u22121 M A1\u22121 )A0\n\u22121\nt\n= (A\u22121\n1 A0 ) N1 (A1 A0 )\n\n= C t N1 C\nThen,\nX\n\n=\n=\n\nN0 \u2212 N0t\nC t N1 C \u2212 C t N1t C\n\n=\n=\n\nC t (N1 \u2212 N1t )C\nC t XC.\n\nNow the key step is to find a homeomorphism of the pure mapping class group\nthat induces C with respect to the ordered basis \u03a61 ({ai }). This, in turn, will prove\nthat N0 is an ordered Seifert matrix for \u03a31 . (Actually the pure mapping class\ngroup, which fixes the boundary components pointwise, is stronger than necessary.\nFixing the boundary component-wise would be sufficient; however, the ordinary\nmapping class group only fixes the boundary set-wise.) For the case of knots, this\nkey step is easy. There C is symplectic, and thus is well-known to be induced by\nsuch a homeomorphism, since the map from the pure mapping class group to the\nsymplectic group is surjective [MKS, pp. 178, 355-6]. For links however, C is not\nsymplectic, and it takes several steps to find a homeomorphism inducing C.\nLemma 6.6. The matrix C is of the form ( I0 B\nS ) where S is a symplectic matrix.\nProof. By construction, C = A1\u22121 A0 . We know by definition that A0 and A1 are\nof the form Ai = ( I0 \u2217\u2217 ).\n\u22121\nI Y\nI \u2217\nFirst we want\n\u0001 to show that A1 is also of the form ( 0 \u2217 ).

The matrix D = ( I0 S0 ), relative to any fixed semi-symplectic basis, is\ninduced by a homeomorphism of the pure mapping class group.\nProof. We want to consider D to represent an action on H1 (\u03a31 ). If \u03a3 were a\nonce-punctured surface (in other words, if our link were a knot), then D would be\nsymplectic and this action would then be induced by a homeomorphism from the\npure mapping class group [MKS].\nOur Seifert surface \u03a31 is an m-punctured surface. Choose a representative curve\n\u03b2i \u2282 \u03a31 for each of the last 2g basis elements of \u03b21 , where m \u2264 i \u2264 2g + m \u2212 1,\nsuch that the geometric intersections among representatives respect the algebraic\nintersections determined by the ordered Seifert matrix.\nTemporarily cap off the m boundary components with disks D1 , . . . , Dm , forming\na new closed surface \u03a3. Consider a larger disk U \u2282 \u03a3 that encompasses all the\nsmaller disks D1 , . . . , Dm , but does not intersect any of \u03b2 m , . . . , \u03b2 2g+m\u22121 . This\nis possible. Since the 2g basis elements are semi-symplectic, we can cut \u03a3 along\nthese curves to obtain an m-punctured 2g-gon. The disk U can be chosen in the\ninterior of this 2g-gon such that it will encompass all of the disks Di (a pushoff of\nthe 2g-gon's boundary will suffice).\nNow \u03a3 \u2212 U , a subset of \u03a31 , is a once-punctured surface with symplectic basis\n\u03b2 m , . . . , \u03b2 2g+m\u22121 . Where D = ( I0 S0 ) represents an action on H1 (\u03a31 ), S represents\nan action on H1 (\u03a3\u2212U ) and corresponds to a homeomorphism g of the pure mapping\nclass group by the surjective map mentioned above.\nWe can extend g to g, which agrees with g on \u03a3\u2212U \u2282 \u03a31 and fixes the remaining\nm\nS\nDj \u2282 \u03a31 . We now have that the homeomorphism g induces the action\nU\u2212\nj=1\n\nD = ( I0 S0 ) on H1 (\u03a31 ).\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 6.8.

These homeomorphisms can be realized as simple Dehn\ntwists, and are illustrated in figure 13.\nIn each of these figures, the surface \u03a31 is represented schematically as a genus\n2g surface with m boundary components. Pairs of the standard symplectic basis\nelements are labelled {ai , bi }, while the boundary basis elements are labelled ci .\nThe notation Db (a) is used to represent the effect on the curve a of performing a\nDehn twist about the curve b. Using this notation, we show that ai can be taken\nto ai + cj by the composition of Dehn twists D\u2212bi (Dbi +cj (ai )) = ai + cj . Similarly,\nD\u2212ai (Dai +cj (bi )) = bi + cj .\n\n\fSTRONG S-EQUIVALENCE OF ORDERED LINKS\n\n21\n\nFigure 13. Dehn twists D\u2212bi (Dbi +cj (ai )) = ai + cj .\nSince each Ei,j fixes the first m \u2212 1 basis elements, Ei,j is induced by a homeomorphism fi,j that fixes the first m \u2212 1 boundary components of \u03a3i and hence\nfixes all m boundary components. All that is required for the sake of C is that\nthe boundary be fixed, component-wise. However, as the fi,j are constructed from\nthese simple Dehn twists, they can easily be taken to fix the boundary components point-wise. Now, E, as a product of elementary matrices Ei,j , is induced by\nthe corresponding composition of the fi,j . That is, the action of E on H1 (\u03a31 ) is\nm\u22121 2g bi,j\n\ninduced by the composition f = \u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6 fi,j of homeomorphisms fi,j .\n\ni=1 j=1 k=1\n\n\u0003\n\nTogether, Lemmas 6.7 and 6.8 imply that C is induced by a homeomorphism\nh = f \u25e6 g of the pure mapping class group. Now we can use the homeomorphisms\n\u03a60 : Fg \u2192 \u03a30 and h \u25e6 \u03a61 : Fg \u2192 \u03a31 to put \u03a30 and \u03a31 into disk and band form\nas in Figure 14. The basis elements h \u25e6 \u03a61 ({ai }) are the columns of the matrix\nC. Where N1 was the Seifert matrix for \u03a31 with respect to the basis \u03a61 ({ai }),\nnow N0 = ht\u2217 N1 h\u2217 = C t N1 C is the Seifert matrix for \u03a31 with respect to the basis\nh\u25e6\u03a61 ({ai }). Thus the Seifert surfaces \u03a30 and \u03a31 , together with the semi-symplectic\n\n\f22\n\nCAROL GWOSDZ GEE\n\nbases \u03a60 ({ai }) and h \u25e6 \u03a61 ({ai }), respectively, give rise to a shared ordered Seifert\nmatrix N0 for L0 and L1 .\n\u0003\nFinally, the tools are in place to prove the final implication of the Main Theorem.\nProof of iv. =\u21d2 i.. Suppose L0 and L1 have the same ordered Seifert matrix M\nwith respect to Seifert surfaces \u03a30 and \u03a31 and ordered bases \u03b20 and \u03b21 of H1 (\u03a30 )\nand H1 (\u03a31 ), respectively. Proposition 6.5 states that the Seifert surfaces \u03a30 and\n\u03a31 can be arranged in disk-band form as in Figure 14, with new semi-symplectic\nbases \u03b30 and \u03b31 that each give rise to a shared ordered Seifert matrix N for L0 and\nL1 .\n\nFigure 14. \u03a30 and \u03a31 differ by string links \u039b0 and \u039b1 on their bands\nIn their new disk-band form, the Seifert surfaces \u03a30 and \u03a31 differ only by the\nstring links \u039b0 and \u039b1 of bands. Because \u03b30 and \u03b31 were chosen to be semisymplectic, the new basis elements run straight through each band. The sets of\npairwise linking numbers for \u039b0 and \u039b1 are equal, both being determined by the\nmatrix N . By Murakami-Nakanishi's theorem [MN], \u039b0 and \u039b1 are related by a\nsequence of (single) delta moves. Therefore our original links L0 and L1 are related\nby a sequence of doubled-delta moves, having two oppositely oriented strands for\neach band of \u039b0 or \u039b1 .\nAlthough the issue of framing on the bands of \u03a30 and \u03a31 has not yet been\naddressed, it is clear that the delta move doesn't change the framing on any strand\nof a string link, and the doubled-delta move doesn't alter the self-linking of any of\nthe bands. Moreover, the framing of each band corresponds to the self-linking of\nthe basis element running through that band and is thus the same for \u03a30 as for \u03a31 ,\nboth being determined by the diagonal entries of N .\n\u0003\nReferences\n[CT] James Conant and Peter Teichner.
