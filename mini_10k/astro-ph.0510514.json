Introduction\nCepheid stars, through their PeriodLuminosity (PL) relation, are one of the\nkey tools in determining the extragalactic\ndistance scale. In spite of its fundamental\nimportance, to this day, it is still unclear the\nrole played by the chemical composition\non the pulsational properties of these stars.\nRecent theoretical works give different results:\nsome authors claim that metallicity has negligible effects on the PL relation (Chiosi et al.\n1992; Sandage et al. 1999; Baraffe & Alibert\n2001); others claim that there is a significant\nSend offprint requests to: M. Mottini\n\ndependence of the PL relation on metallicity\n(Bono et al. 1999; Fiorentino et al. 2002;\nMarconi et al. 2005).\nAlthough most of the observational efforts\naiming at deriving the chemical composition\nof Cepheids and its effects on PL relation have\nused indirect means, like the measurement of\noxygen abundances in the H \uf769\uf769 regions (e.g.\nSasselov et al. 1997; Kennicutt et al. 1998;\nSakai et al. 2004), some of them have focused\non a direct chemical analysis (Fry & Carney\n1997; Luck et al. 1998; Andrievsky et al.\n2002; Luck et al. 2003). Our study follows\nthis second approach: we analysed a sample of high resolution spectra and derived\n\n\fMottini et al.: Chemical Composition of Cepheids\n\n\u03b1-elements and iron abundances spectroscopically. The preliminary results for a sub-sample\nof 37 stars have already been presented in\nRomaniello et al. (2005). Here we present the\ncomplete sample.\n\n2. The data sample\nWe used the following selection criteria to\nchoose the Cepheids of this data set: stars\nfrom three galaxies (Milky Way, LMC and\nSMC) in order to cover a factor of about\nten in metallicity, well-determined intensitymean magnitude in B, V and K bands\nfor all the Cepheids (Laney & Stobie 1994;\nGroenewegen et al. 2004; Storm et al. 2004); a\nwide range of periods in order to cover the entire PL relation (from 2 to 98 days).\nWe have a sample of 68 Cepheids: 32\nGalactic Cepheids, 22 LMC and 14 SMC\nCepheids. The spectra of the Galactic Cepheids\nhave been collected with FEROS (R=48 000,\nspectral coverage: 3700-8600 \u00c5) at the ESO\n1.5 meter telescope (La Silla) with a S /N \u223c\n150 for \u03bb > 5000 \u00c5, S /N \u223c 70 for \u03bb > 4000 \u00c5.\nThe spectra of the Magellanic Cepheids have\nbeen collected with UVES (R=40 000, spectral\ncoverage: 4800-6800 \u00c5 for the red arm) at the\nESO VLT-Kueyen (Paranal) with a S /N \u223c 70\nfor \u03bb > 5800 \u00c5, S /N \u223c 50 for \u03bb > 4800 \u00c5.\n\n3. The analysis\nIn order to derive elemental abundances one\nneeds to know the stellar parameters of the star\nand have a reliable line list available.\nAs a first step we carefully assembled\nthe line list. We have assembled our Fe \uf769-Fe \uf769\uf769\nand \u03b1-elements line list from Clementini et al.\n(1995), Fry & Carney (1997), Kiss & Vinko\n(2000) and Andrievsky et al. (2002) including\na selection of lines from VALD (Kupka et al.\n1999; Ryabchikova et al. 1999). The VALD\nlines have been selected for effective temperatures typical of Cepheid stars (4500-6500 K).\nWe have, then, visually inspected each line on\nthe observed spectra, in order to check their\nprofile and to discard blended lines. In order\nto do so, we have searched the VALD database\n(with the command extract stellar) for all the\n\n283\n\nlisted lines between 4800 and 7900 \u00c5 on stellar spectra characterised by parameters typical\nof Cepheids (T eff =4500 K, 5500 K and 6500 K,\nlog g=2 and vt =3 kms\u22121 ). We then overplotted\nall the lines found in VALD, that fall within \u00b13\n\u00c5 from each of our lines, and checked for their\npossible contribution to the equivalent width of\nour line. Any contribution larger than 5% of the\nline strength made us discarding the line under\nscrutiny.\nOur final list includes 246 Fe \uf769 lines and 17\nFe \uf769\uf769 lines spanning a spectral range from 4800\n\u00c5 to 7900 \u00c5 which is the range covered by our\nFEROS spectra. For the UVES spectra this list\nis slightly reduced due to their narrower spectral range. Simultaneously we also looked at\n\u03b1- elements (O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca and Ti) and\nwe have assembled a list of almost 200 lines.\nFor all the lines we have adopted the physical\nproperties (oscillator strengths, excitation potentials) listed in VALD.\nAs a second step we measured the equivalent widths (EW) of all the lines assembled as\ndescribed above. Because of their large number, we have used a semi-interactive routine\ndeveloped by one of us (PF, fitline). This code\nis based on genetic algorithms, which mimic\nhow DNA can be affected to make the evolution of species (Charbonneau 1995) and it uses\na Gaussian fit. For about 15% of the lines, the\nGaussian profile adopted by fitline could not\nsatisfactorily reproduce the observed profile.\nFor these cases (usually very broad or asymmetric lines), the equivalent widths were measured manually with the IRAF splot task. The\nmean difference, as computed for those lines\nfor which both methods could be applied, is\naround 1.5 m\u00c5, comparable to the average error on the EW inferred from the quality of the\ndata (Equation 7, Cayrel 1988). The outcome\nof this test is that we can then safely use all\nour EW measurements, independently of the\nmethod followed to derive them.\nWith these EWs in hand we then derived\nthe microturbulent velocity and gravity of the\nstudied star. We used as first guess values typical of Cepheids as inferred from previous studies (see Section 1 for references) then we got\nthe final constraints from the abundance analysis: from the minimization of the log(Fe/H) vs\n\n\f284\n\nMottini et al.: Chemical Composition of Cepheids\n\nEW slope for the microturbulent velocity and\nfrom the ionization balance for the log g. For\nthe determination of the effective temperature\nwe used the line depth ratios method described\nin Kovtyukh & Gorlova (2000).\nFinally we determined the elemental abundances of our stars by using the Kurucz\nWIDTH9 code (Kurucz 1993) and LTE\nmodel atmospheres computed without the\novershooting approximation and with the\nmost recent opacity distribution functions\n(Castelli & Kurucz 2003).\n\n4. Results and future developments\nFigure 1 shows the distributions of the iron\nabundances of our programme stars in the\nGalaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. In the latter case we compare our results with the mean\nvalues obtained by Hill et al. (1995) and Hill\n(1997) for F and K supergiants in the LMC\nand SMC, respectively. We note a good agreement with our mean values of the iron content.\nFor our Galactic sample, we find that the mean\nvalue of the iron content is solar (\u03c3 = 0.10),\nwith a range of values between \u22120.18 dex and\n+0.25 dex. These two extremes are represented\nrespectively by 2 and 1 stars (out of the 32\nin total). We note that more than 50% of the\nstars have a sub-solar metallicity. For the LMC\nsample, we find a mean metallicity value of\n\u223c \u22120.33 dex (\u03c3 = 0.13), with a range of values between \u22120.62 dex and \u22120.10 dex. Here,\nthe more metal-rich extreme is just an isolated\ncase, while the metal-poor end of the distribution is represented by 3 stars. For the SMC\nsample, we find that the mean value is about\n\u223c \u22120.75 dex (\u03c3 = 0.08), with a range of values between \u22120.87 and \u22120.63. While the average values for each galaxy are in good agreement with non-pulsating stars of similar age,\nCepheids display a significant spread. Thus it\nis fundamental to measure the metallicity of individual stars. Detailed discussion of these results and their comparison with previous studies will be presented in a forthcoming paper\n(Mottini et al. 2006), along with an analysis of\nthe effects of the metallicity on the Cepheid\nPeriod-Luminosity relation, also showed by\nRomaniello et al. in these proceedings. In the\n\nvery near future we will focus on the analysis\nof the \u03b1-elements results and their interpretation.\n\nReferences\nAndrievsky, S.M. et al. 2002, A&A, 381, 32\nBaraffe, I. & Alibert, Y. 2001, A&A, 371, 592\nBono, G. et al. 1999, ApJ, 512, 711\nCastelli, F. & Kurucz, R.L. 2003, in Modelling\nof Stellar Atmospheres, 210th IAU\nSymposium, Edited by N.
