INTRODUCTION\n\nSince the classic work by Oort et al. (1958), there have\nbeen many attempts to use the kinematic properties of\nthe diffuse gas to determine the large scale spiral structure of the Milky Way. Very early in the study of the\nGalaxy, it was determined that the orbits of the disk\ncomponents of the Galaxy were not very different from\ncircular, with an orbital frequency that decreases monotonically as a function of galactocentric radius. These\nfacts allow the use of the kinematic distance method as a\nfirst approximation to map the gaseous component of the\ngalactic disk. Two of the main strengths of this method\n(that it can be used for a very large fraction of the Galaxy\nand that it can be applied to the gaseous component of\ndisk, which is notoriously difficult to obtain a distance\nto) make it particularly useful for this goal. Nevertheless, it was soon realized that the deviations from circular orbits, however small in absolute value, might have a\nstrong impact on how we see the Galaxy.\nOne of the first difficulties of the kinematic distance\nmethod appeared in the determination of the rotation\ncurve, namely, in the fact that the circular rotation velocity measured for positive galactic longitudes (northern Galaxy) did not match the one measured for negative longitudes (southern Galaxy). The simplest way to\nreconcile these observed rotation laws is to take their average, assuming that the differences generated by nonaxisymmetric structure will cancel out. Kerr (1962)\nshowed that this approximation leads to large northsouth asymmetries that, given their heliocentric nature,\nseemed unlikely. It became clear that the complex kinematic structure revealed in the diffuse gas surveys, like\nthe presence of gas at forbidden velocities, or the oscillations in the rotation curve, was itself a consequence of\nthe spiral structure that was being sought. Given the importance of the rotation curve for the understanding of\nthe galactic dynamics, in addition of the determination\nof kinematic distances, a different approach to measuring\nthe rotation curve was needed.\nA frequently used method to obtain the galactic roElectronic address: g.gomez@astrosmo.unam.mx\n\ntation curve involves measuring the full velocity field\nof discreet sources that might share the motion of the\ndiffuse gas (young objects like H II regions, for example), and then averaging the so obtained azimuthal velocities. This approach has lead to models of the rotation curve (Brand & Blitz 1993; Maciel & Lago 2005)\nthat might more closely trace the real mass distribution of the Galaxy, but introduce new sources of error\nwhen used to obtain kinematic distances. Nevertheless, generally accepted models of the spiral structure\n(Georgelin & Georgelin 1976; Taylor & Cordes 1993)\nhave been obtained using this assumption. (For a nice\nreview of the early work, see Kerr 1969)\nAnother approach involves the modelling of the noncircular motions of the gas, instead of forcing the\nassumption of circular orbits.\nIn a recent paper,\nFoster & MacWilliams (2006) used an analytic approach\nfor the velocity field of the outer Galaxy. In this work,\na numerical model of the galactic disk, with full MHD,\nis used to further explore the effects of non-circular motions in the image one would obtain of the Galaxy when\nwe rely on the kinematic method for distances. An observer is imagined inside the numerical model, which is\nassumed similar to the Milky Way, and the analysis that\nthis observer would perform is reproduced. In \u00a72, a brief\ndescription of the numerical simulation is presented; in\n\u00a73 the selection of the observer's position is described,\nand how the measurement of the rotation curve was emulated; \u00a74 presents an analysis of the errors in the kinematic distances and how they affect the image the observer generates of his/her home galaxy; finally, \u00a75 summarizes the results.\n2. THE SIMULATION\n\nThe numerical model used here is described elsewhere (Martos et al. 2004a,b; Y\u00e1\u00f1ez 2005), and only an\noverview is presented here.\nThe initial setup consisted of a gaseous disk with an\nexponential density profile in the radial direction, with\na scale length of 4 kpc. The density at the position of\nthe Sun (at 8 kpc from the galactic center) was taken\nto be 1.11 cm\u22123 . The equation of state for the gas was\n\n\f2\nisothermal with T = 104 \u25e6 K. This disk was threaded by\nan azimuthal magnetic field, with strength given by the\nrelation,\npB = pM\n\nn\n,\nn + nc\n\n(1)\n\nwhere pB is the magnetic pressure, n is the gas density,\npM = 1.43\u00d710\u221212 dyn cm\u22122 , and nc = 0.04 cm\u22123 . Equation (1) yields B = 5.89 \u03bcG for r = R\u2299 . This intensity,\nand the magnetic field geometry, were set only as initial\nconditions, and were allowed to evolve in time according\nto the ideal MHD equations.\nThe gas initially follows circular orbits, with a velocity\ngiven by the equilibrium between the background gravitational potential, the thermal and magnetic pressures,\nand the magnetic tension:\nv\u03c62\n1 \u2202(pT + pB ) \u2202\u03a6 2pB\n=\n+\n+\n,\nr\n\u03c1\n\u2202r\n\u2202r\n\u03c1\n\n(2)\n\nwhere v\u03c6 is the azimuthal velocity, \u03c1 = meff n is the gas\nmass density, meff = 1.27mH is the mean particle mass,\npT is the thermal pressure, and \u03a6 is the gravitational\npotential described by Dehnen & Binney (1998, model\n2).\nThe equilibrium was then perturbed by the two-armed\nspiral potential described in Pichardo et al. (2003). The\nsimulation was performed in the perturbation reference\nframe, which rotates with an angular speed \u03a9P =\n20 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 (Martos et al. 2004a,b). It is worth\nmentioning that the perturbing potential was calculated\nas a superposition of oblate spheroidals, and so it does\nnot have the usual sinusoidal profile. Also, the parameters that describe the perturbation (total mass in the\narms, pitch angle, pattern speed, etc.) were constrained\nby those authors so that the pattern is self-consistent in\nthe stellar orbits sense.\nThe MHD equations were solved using a version of\nthe ZEUS code (Stone & Norman 1992a,b), a finite difference, time explicit, operator split, eulerian code for\nideal magnetohydrodynamics. The numerical domain\nconsisted in a two-dimensional grid in cylindrical geometry, with 5002 points. The numerical domain extended\nfrom 1 kpc through 15 kpc in radius, and spanned a full\ncircle in azimuthal angle. The boundary conditions were\nreflecting in the radial direction.\nFigure 1 shows the simulation after 1 Gyr of evolution.\nThe most important characteristics of the simulation at\nthis stage are: 1) although the perturbation consists of\ntwo spiral arms, the gas forms four arms (two pairs with\npitch angles of 9o and 13o each, as opposed to the perturbation with a pitch angle of 15.5o ); 2) a high density\nring is formed at r \u2248 4 kpc; and, 3) a low density ring\nis formed near corotation, at r \u2248 11 kpc. Again, details\nof the simulation and the physical phenomena related to\nthese structures are discussed elsewhere. The corotation\nlow density ring was found (using a different background\npotential) by Martos & Y\u00e1\u00f1ez (private communication).\nA study of the neccesary conditions for the formation of\nsuch ring, its physics and consequences for our Galaxy is\npresented in Martos (2006, in preparation).\nG\u00f3mez & Cox (2004a,b) also performed large scale\nsimulations of the Galaxy. Since their numerical model\n\nFig. 1.- Density distribution of the simulation after 1 Gyr of\nevolution. The grayscale shows the gas density in units of cm\u22123 .\nIt is noticeable that, although the perturbation has only two arms,\nthe gas response shows four arms. The Sun symbol shows the\nposition chosen for the imaginary observer.\n\nwas three-dimensional, they were able to study some phenomena (like the vertical motions associated to the hydraulic jump behavior of the gas near the spiral arms)\nthat could have an impact in the dynamics of the gas\nnear the midplane. Nevertheless, the focus of their model\nwas to study those phenomena, and an emulation of the\nMilky Way Galaxy was not a priority. Specifically, their\nthree-dimensional numerical grid, a necessity in their\nwork, restricted the spatial resolution achivable in the\nmidplane. This, together with the low value for \u03a9P used,\ndid not allow the formation of four spiral arms as a response to a two-arm spiral potential (in order to obtain\nfour gaseous arms, their model included a four-arm potential). In the present work, the model was restricted\nto the galactic plane so that sufficient resolution can be\nreached.\n3. THE SYNTHETIC OBSERVATIONS\n\nLocal maxima in column density (N ) vs. galactic longitude (l) plots for the diffuse gas are usually interpreted\nas the directions at which the line-of-sight is tangent to\nspiral arms. The N vs. l distribution an imaginary observer would see if placed inside this model galaxy is\npresented in Figure 2. By moving the observer around\nthe solar circle, at 8 kpc in the numerical model, the\nnumber and positions of the local maxima can be fitted to the observed values for the diffuse gas. In this\nwork, the chosen directions were those tangent to the\nlocus of the spiral arms proposed by Taylor & Cordes\n(1993), namely, l = \u221276.5o, \u221251.6o , \u221232.4o , 32.7o and\n47.1o . It was found that by choosing the position shown\nin Figure 1 for the imaginary observer all but one of the\ncolumn density local maxima in the model fall within\n3o of these quoted directions. If the tangent directions quoted by Drimmel & Spergel (2001) are adopted,\nnamely l \u2248 \u221280o , \u00b150o and \u00b130o , all but one of the tangent directions yield an even better fit. (The difference\nbetween the ill-fitting tangent in the model, at l \u2248 \u221272o ,\n\n\f3\n\nFig. 2.- Column density, in arbitrary units, vs. galactic longitude in the simulation. By moving the imaginary observer around\na circle of radius R\u2299 = 8 kpc, the local maxima can be matched to\nthe observed directions tangent to the spiral arms (thick vertical\nlines). The dashed area at |l| < 7o shows the simulation inner\nradial boundary.\n\nFig. 3.- Line-of-sight component of the velocity field as a\nfunction of galactic longitude and (real) distance to the observer,\nwith contours every 50 km s\u22121 (the thicker contour marks the ur =\n0 km s\u22121 level). The dotted line shows the locus of the tangent\npoints, while the circles show the positions at which the terminal\nvelocity is reached.\n\nand the quoted direction is in fact smaller than the width\nof the feature observed in 240 \u03bcm. See, for example,\nDrimmel 2000 and Drimmel & Spergel 2001.)\n\nimaginary observer, since this choice would more closely\nmimic the procedure used to determine the Local Standard of Rest from galactic sources (Binney & Merrifield\n1998). There will still be streaming gas, but this will happen in the radial direction only. Such radially streaming\ngas has been reported by Brand & Blitz (1993).\nFigure 3 shows the line-of-sight component of the velocity field. The Figure also shows the actual positions\nat which the terminal velocity is reached for a given l.\nAlthough the distance between those terminal-velocity\npoints and the tangent points is typically small, the noncircular motions and spiral shocks generate kpc-scale deviations and discontinuities in the terminal-velocity locus. Since those deviations happen at the positions of the\nspiral arms, they will generate larger errors at the vicinity of the arms, and will strongly affect the observer's\nview of the spiral structure of the model galaxy.\nFor the outer galaxy (r > R\u2299 ), the usual procedure to\ndetermine the rotation curve involves looking for sources\nwith independently known distance and measuring their\nline-of-sight velocity (Brand & Blitz 1993, for example).\nThis procedure was simulated by assuming that the observer finds such a source at each point of the numerical\ngrid outside the solar circle. It is assumed that the distances to such sources are less reliable the farther they\nare from the observer. So, the circular velocity for the\nouter galaxy was taken to be,\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nr \uf8edX w\u03c6 vlos\nvc (r) =\n(4)\n+ v\u2299 \uf8f8 ,\nR\u2299\nsin(l)\n\n3.1. The rotation curve\n\nOnce a position for the observer is chosen, the next step\ntoward calculating the kinematic distances is to adopt\na rotation curve for the simulated galaxy. For the inner galaxy (r < R\u2299 ), the standard procedure consists in\nsearching for the terminal velocity of the gas, i.e., the\nmaximum line-of-sight component of the velocity (minimum, for negative longitudes). If one assumes that the\ngas orbits are circular, the terminal velocity arises from\nthe point at which the line-of-sight is tangent to the orbit, and so, the galactocentric radius of the emitting gas\nis known. Under this assumption, the circular rotation\ncurve for the galaxy is given by:\nvc (r) = vt (l) + v\u2299 sin(l),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere vc is the circular velocity, vt (l) is the terminal\nvelocity for a given galactic longitude, v\u2299 is the velocity\nat the solar circle, and r = R\u2299 sin(l) is the galactocentric\nradius of the tangent point.\nAt this point, a choice between two options for the\nvalue of the circular velocity at the solar circle has to\nbe made. One option is to take the circular velocity\nconsistent with the background gravitational potential\n(v\u2299 = 220 km s\u22121 ). This option has the disadvantage\nthat the gas in the evolved simulation will stream by the\nobserver [although this is not necessarily wrong, since\nthe presence of gas at forbidden velocities in the l \u2212 v\ndiagram is well known (Linblad 1967; Blitz & Spergel\n1991)]. Nevertheless, it was decided in this work to\ntake a second option, which is to take the value for v\u2299\n(= 225 km s\u22121 ) given by the azimuthal velocity of the gas\nin the evolved simulation at the position assigned to the\n\n\u03c6\n\nwhere the weights w\u03c6 decrease linearly with the distance\nto the observer, and the summation is performed, at a\ngiven radius, over the azimuthal points excluding those\nwithin 7o of the galactic center and anti-center directions.\nFigure 4(a) shows the so obtained rotation curves, to-\n\n\f4\n\nFig. 4.- a) The rotation curve given by the background potential (solid line), compared with the measured rotation curve. For the\ninner galaxy, both the rotation measured for positive (dotted line) and negative longitudes (dashed line) are presented. The rotation curve\ncorresponding to the outer galaxy is also shown (dashed-dotted line). b) The rotation curve given by the background potential (solid line),\ncompared with the average of the north and south rotation curves (dotted line) and the mean azimuthal velocity of the gas in the simulation\n(dashed line). Notice that both the mean velocity and the mean rotation curve are above the background rotation curve for most of the\nradial domain.\n\ngether with the rotation consistent with the background\ngravitational potential. The northern rotation curve is\nlower than the southern rotation at \u223c 3.5 kpc < r <\u223c\n5.5 kpc, while the opposite is true up to r = R\u2299 . This\nbehavior is similar to the rotation curves reported by\nBlitz & Spergel (1991), when scaled for R\u2299 = 8 kpc.\nIn order to try to recuperate the true (background)\nrotation, that should more closely trace the large scale\nmass distribution, the average both northern and southern rotation curves was taken. The result is compared\nwith the background rotation in Figure 4(b). Although\nthe result is smoother and closer to the rotation consistent with the background potential, it is still systematically higher (in agreement with the results reported by\nSinha 1978). Another approach is to take the full velocity field and average the azimuthal velocity of the gas\n(Brand & Blitz 1993). The result, also shown in Figure\n4(b), is much closer to the background rotation, but it is\nstill systematically larger.\n4. ERRORS IN THE KINEMATIC DISTANCE\n\nAfter adopting a rotation curve, and assuming that the\ngas follows circular orbits, the errors in the measured\nkinematic distances can be estimated by comparing the\nmeasured with the real distance in the simulation.\nIn order to resolve the distance ambiguity for the inner galaxy, the usual procedure is to bracket the distance\nclose enough as to place the object of interest on either\nside of the tangent point by looking at the galactic lattitude extension of the source (Fish et al. 2003), or using\nobserved intermediate absorption features (Watson et al.\n2003; Sewilo et al. 2004). For this investigation, I decided to cheat: I looked up on which side of the tangent\npoint the gas parcel fell on, and chose the measured distance accordingly.\nFigure 5(a) shows the error in measured distance with\n\nrespect to the real distance in the model. Recalling Figure 4, the observer would determine different rotation\ncurves for the northern and southern sides of the galactic center. Accordingly, in determining the kinematic distance for Figure 5(a), the rotation curve used was that\nof the corresponding side of the galactic center. It is\nnoticeable that although the errors are of the order of\n0.5 kpc in most of the galactic disk, they are significantly\nlarger at the positions of the spiral arms (as hinted by\nG\u00f3mez & Cox 2004b). This fact has a special impact in\nstudies of the spiral structure of the Galaxy that rely\non kinematic distances, since it distorts the image the\nobserver would generate (see \u00a74.1).\nThere is another significant feature in Figure 5. Although the terminal velocity does not really arises from\nthe tangent point, the circular orbits assumption assigns\ngas observed near terminal velocity to that point. This\nfact generates a feature in the errors that corresponds\nto the locus of the tangent points. Again, the error is\nsignificant at the position of the spiral arms and would\ngenerate large errors in the determination of distances to\nobjects that trace the spiral structure.\nThe assumptions of circular orbits and different rotation curves for positive and negative longitudes are, of\ncourse, inconsistent. One solution is to fit a single rotation curve to both sides of the Galaxy. In order to\ntest this method, the average of both rotation curves\nwas taken and the equivalent of Figure 5(a) was calculated. The result was that the magnitude of the error in\nthe kinematic distances was approximately the same, but\nthe area with error > 0.5 kpc spanned a larger fraction\nof the disk.\nSuppose now that the imaginary observer somehow\nmanages to obtain the large scale distribution of stellar\nmass in the model galaxy. This would allow the derivation of the real rotation curve from the background ax-\n\n\f5\n\nFig. 5.- Error in the measured kinematic distance (\u2206d) obtained under the assumption of circular orbits following (a) the measured\nrotation curve, and (b) the rotation given by the background potential. Sections of 7o around the galactic longitudes l = 0o and 180o were\nexcluded. Although the error in most of the galactic disk is of the order of 0.5 kpc, it is significantly larger at the positions of the spiral\narms. The sharp edges at the position of the tangent points are a consequence of the fact that the terminal velocities do not happen at\nthose points. The errors in measured kinematic distances are larger when the real (background) rotation curve is used.\n\nisymmetric potential. If the observer now uses that real\nrotation to determine kinematic distances, even larger\ndistance errors would be obtained, specially for the inner\ngalaxy, as shown in Figure 5(b). This counter-intuitive\nfact arises because, at this point of the simulation, the\ngas has already adopted orbits that are not only influenced by the background potential, but also the large\nscale magnetic field (likely different from the field in the\ninitial conditions) and the torques and resonances generated by the spiral perturbation. Although the real rotation curve is consistent with the most important determinant of the gas rotation velocity (the background mass\ndistribution), it does not include other influences in that\nvelocity, while the \"wrong\" rotation curve determined\nfrom gaseous terminal velocities more closely reflects the\nreal motion of the gas (recall Fig. 4, where the measured\nrotation curve is systematically above the true rotation).\nAlthough intrinsically inconsistent, the two different\nmeasured rotation curves were used in the remaining of\nthis investigation since that procedure leads to smaller\ndistance errors. The results presented in the following\nsection are even more notorious if the average or the real\nrotation curves are used.\n4.1. The Galaxy Distorted.\nConsider now that the imaginary observer tries to\nstudy the spiral structure of the galaxy he/she lives in.\nThe procedure would consist of translating the longitudevelocity data obtained from a diffuse gas survey, for example, into a spatial distribution using the kinematic distances that result from the assumption of circular orbits\nthat follow the measured rotation curve.1 The resulting\n1 In order to diminish spurious interpolation effects, each gas\nparcel was spread using a 2D gaussian weight function into a 3 \u00d7 3\ngrid-cell region around the position corresponding to that parcel's\ngalactic longitude and measured distance.\n\nmap is shown in Figure 6. Notice that the features described for Figure 1 (namely the four spiral arms, the\n4 kpc high density ring, and the corotation low density\nring) all but disappear, while new fictitious features, like\nthe structure in the outer Galaxy, are formed as a consequence of the oscillations in the outer rotation curve.\nAlso significant in this Figure are the regions where little or no gas is assigned by the mapping, namely the\nbands near the corotation circle and the quasi-triangular\nregions near the tangent point locus. (This nearly empty\nregions are significantly larger when the background or\nthe mean rotation curves were used to determine the distance to the observed gas parcel.)\nThe imaginary observer would likely conclude that\nhis/her home galaxy has 2 ill-defined spiral arms. If a\nlogarithmic spiral model were forced, an \u223c 11o pitch angle and a density contrast much stronger than that in\nthe numerical model would be found.\nAnother possibility for determining the distance to a\ngas parcel consists in comparing the line-of-sight velocity\nof the parcel with the predicted velocity obtained from\nsome model for the galactic structure. For the numerical model described in \u00a72, given a galactic longitude,\nFigure 3 is searched for the required velocity, and the\ncorresponding distance is read out.2 Although the same\nprocedure to solve the ambiguity with respect to the tangent point was used, the non-circular motions introduce\nnew distance ambiguities for certain longitude-velocity\nvalues (up to 11, although 3 is a more typical number).\nWhen these ambiguities appear, they happen close to\n2 A simple C language program that provides a distance given a\ngalactic longitude and line-of-sight velocity value and uncertainty\nis available at http://www.astrosmo.unam.mx/~g.gomez/publica/.\nIn that program, the resulting distance is given as a range, instead\nof a central value and uncertainty, since the velocity-distance mapping makes the distance probability distribution neither uniform\nin the range, nor peaked around a central value.\n\n\f6\neach other, making their resolution difficult. So, when\nreconstructing the map of the galaxy, the gas density\nwas equally split among these positions.\nThe result is shown in Figure 7. The new distance ambiguities still introduce spurious structure, like the splitting of the spiral arms. Nevertheless, the number and\nposition of the arms, the structure around the corotation radius and the lack of features in the outer galaxy\nare recovered. The imaginary observer would likely conclude that his/her home galaxy has 4 arms with 9o\nand 12.5o pitch angles, although he/she would also find\nnon-existing bridges and spurs. On the other hand, it\nshould be considered that the imaginary observer does\nnot see thermal nor turbulent line broadening. When\nthese are considered, some of the new ambiguities will\nbe swallowed into a distance range, effectively dissapearing. Therefore, some of the spurious structures will blend\nwith real structures. So, the observer might get an image of the model galaxy closer to reality than Figure 7\nsuggests.\n5. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe effect of the circular orbits assumption on our idea\nof the large scale structure of the Galaxy was explored.\nSince these errors might be quite large at the position\nof the spiral arms, the study of the spiral structure of\nthe Galaxy and objects associated with it is particularly\naffected. By simulating the way an imaginary observer\ninside the model galaxy might try to infer the structure\nof the gaseous disk, it was found that the circular orbits assumption destroys the spiral structure and creates\nspurious features in the measured distribution.\nThe method of kinematic distances is a powerful\none since it allows measurement of distances to diffuse\nsources and it is easily applicable to a large fraction of\nthe galactic disk. Even if the measured rotation curve includes deviations that do not reflect the true large scale\nmass distribution, Figure 5(a) shows that the errors in\n\nFig. 6.- Re-mapping of the gas distribution resulting from the\nkinematic distances using the measured rotation curves in Figure\n4(a) and assuming circular gas orbits. Notice the regions near the\ntangent points and the corotation circle, where little or no gas is\nmapped to.\n\nFig. 7.- Same as Figure 6, but using the full velocity field\nto recover the density distribution. Most of the characteristics of\nFigure 1 are recovered, although some spurious structure appears\ndue to the new distance ambiguities introduced by the non-circular\nmotions.\n\nthe distance are, in fact not very large for most of the\ngalactic disk; in fact, the distance errors that arise from\nusing the true rotation curve are larger. In both cases,\nhowever, the errors are quite large at the positions of\nthe spiral arms. If we want to use this distance method\nfor objects associated with the spiral structure, we need\nto consider non-circular motions (as has been succesfully\nshown by Foster & MacWilliams 2006 for a set of H II\nregions and SNR).\nOne possibility to achieve this is to try to determine\nthe full velocity field of the galactic disk. But direct measure of distances to the diffuse gas component is quite\ndifficult (therefore the strength of the kinematic distance\nmethod). So, we need to use discreet objects and assume\nthat they share their velocity with the diffuse component\n(Brand & Blitz 1993, for example; see also discussion in\nMinn & Greenberg 1973). Yet another difficulty arises\nwhen tangential velocities and distances are required beyond the solar neighborhood.\nAnother approach at determining the full velocity field\nis to model it. Recently, Foster & MacWilliams (2006)\nused an analytical model of the density and velocity fields\nof the diffuse gas, with parameters for the model fitted\nto H I observations of the outer Galaxy. Despite the\nfact that their density and velocity models are not consistent in the hydrodynamics sense, and that the model\ndo not include the dynamical effects of magnetic fields,\nthey were able to add features of the Galaxy that are currently difficult to incorporate to numerical models, like\nthe disk's warp or the rolling motions associated with the\nspiral arms. Further numerical studies should allow the\ndevelopment of a more realistic analytical model.\nInstead of an analytic model, a numerical model was\nused in the present work to obtain density and velocity\nfields. Since the focus is in large scale velocity structures, an eulerian code provides a good approach. Also,\nsince the galactic magnetic field has been proved to\nbe an important component of the total ISM pressure\n\n\f7\n(Boulares & Cox 1990), its effect in the gas dynamics is\nlikely to be important; therefore, a full MHD simulation\nwas required. The large scale forcing is also trascendant; since the azimuthal shape of the spiral perturbation appears to have an influence on the gaseous response\n(Franco et al. 2002), the usual sinusoidal perturbation\nwas deemed too simplistic and a self-consistent model for\nthe perturbing arms was chosen. At the present time,\nthe galactic warp and the vertical motions associated\nwith the spiral arms (G\u00f3mez & Cox 2004a,b) could not\nbe considered at the necessary resolution.\nIn this work, it has been shown that it is possible to\nrecover most of the gaseous structure of the galactic disk\nusing kinematic distances, as long as the full velocity\nfield is considered. Nevertheless, applying these results\nto the Milky Way is a whole new issue, since obtaining\nthe full velocity field is not trivial. For the procedure\n\nused here, how close the numerical simulation is to the\nreal Galaxy remains the weak point of this approach.\nThe computation cost of a realistic enough simulation\nis still too high to allow a parameter fitting analysis.\nSo, the remaining question is if the velocity field that\nresults from the simulation yields a determination of the\ndistance to a given object, or only an estimation of the\ndistance error. The answer to that question is left to the\nreader's criterion.\n\nThis author wishes to thank J. Ballesteros-Paredes, E.\nV\u00e1zquez-Semadeni, C. Watson, J. Franco, L. Loinard,\nS.
