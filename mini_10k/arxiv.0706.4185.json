New physics at the\nTeV scale is generally invoked to explain this hierarchy\nproblem. But quark mass terms break the electroweak\nsymmetry, so the quark mass matrices are necessarily\nconnected to this new physics. New higgs dynamics at\nthe TeV scale leads inescapably to new flavor physics.\nThis statement is straightforwardly verified in all available examples. Perhaps the most popular, the MSSM,\nis the most obvious: the solution to the hierarchy problem comes with a plethora of new fields carrying flavor,\nnamely, the squarks. But other, less well known examples, like the Lee-Wick Standard Model[1], similarly contain an intricate flavor structure (in this case, an unstable\nresonance is associated with each known particle).\nTo describe the effects of new TeV dynamics at below\nTeV energies in a model independent approach one simply extends the Lagrangian of the standard model (SM)\nby operators of dimension higher than four, suppressed\nby powers of the new physics scale, \u039b. Buchmuller and\nWyler[2] and Leung, Love and Rao[3], listed all operators of dimension five and six and analyzed their effects.\nIgnoring operators mediating flavor changing neutral currents (FCNC), \u039b \u223c a few TeV is consistent with experiment. But if the coefficient of FCNC operators is given\nby dimensional analysis, then \u039b \u223c a few TeV is strongly\nexcluded. A much larger scale, \u039b 104 TeV, is still consistent with experiment, but then a hierarchy problem\nreappears.\nSo if we want to insist that the scale of new physics be\na few TeV we need some principle that will make the coefficient of the dangerous FCNC operators automatically\n(naturally) small. The principle of Minimal Flavor Violation (MFV) does just that. We will describe MFV below,\nbut we pause here to note the generality of these observations: we have assumed that below a scale of about\na TeV our model has the field content of the standard\nmodel, and have insisted in the absence of fine tunings\n(the very reason we need new physics at the TeV scale).\nMoreover, the principle can be readily generalized to the\ncases where below the scale of new physics the model has\ntwo higgs doublets, or no higgs at all (a strongly coupled\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: bgrinstein@ucsd.edu\n\nhiggs sector). It is this generality that I find so compelling. Not only seems MFV inescapable, it seems we\nhave learned something deep and fundamental, namely,\nthat the origin of flavor is to be found in some secluded\nsector that expresses itself only through a single channel.\nII.\n\nMFV\n\nIn the absence of quark masses the SM lagrangian has\na large exact flavor symmetry group, GF = SU (3)3 \u00d7\nU (1)2 , arising from independent unitary rotations of the\nthree flavors of quark doublets qL , and singlets uR and\ndR . In the SM this symmetry is broken only by the\nYukawa terms in the lagrangian that result in quark\nmasses once the higgs gets a vev,\nij i j\ni j\nLY = \u03bbij\nU H q\u0304L uR + \u03bbD q\u0304L dR + h.c.\n\n(1)\n\nThe basic premise of the MFV hypothesis is that there\nis a unique source of breaking of the GF symmetry. We\nalready have GF breaking in (1), so any additional terms\nthat break GF must transform under GF in exactly the\nsame way as (1). This principle can be implemented in\nextensions of the standard model that incorporate new\n(yet undiscovered) fields that carry flavor quantum numbers. But we will be interested in a model independent\nanalysis and this is accomplished by adjoining to the SM\nall operators of dimension higher than four constructed\nof SM fields. Those operators that break GF must transform just as the Yukawa terms.\nThis all sounds very general and abstract. It is perhaps\neasier to understand this in a particular context, so let's\nconsider an example. In the SM the flavor changing neutral current first appears at one loop and is dominated\nby the graph with a top quark. The low energy effective\ninteraction hamiltonian for KL \u2192 \u03c0\u03bd \u03bd\u0304 is\nX\n4GF\nHeff,SM = \u221a C\ns\u0304L \u03b3\u03bc dL \u03bd\u0304Ll \u03b3 \u03bc \u03bdLl + h.c.\n2 l=e,\u03bc\u03c4\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\u03b1\nC=\nX(mt /mW ) Vts\u2217 Vtd\n2\u03c0 sin2 \u03b8W\n\n(3)\n\nThe factor in the square bracket includes the obvious\nelectroweak coupling constants and a function X(x), with\nX \u223c 1 for x & 1, that results from performing the 1loop integral. The second factor, involving the product\n\n\f2\nof fields an couplings:\nof CKM elements, contains the flavor information and\nmakes the coefficient C small.

Similarly, using measured FCNC\nprocesses, such as K 0 -K\u0304 0 , B 0 -B\u0304 0 or Bs0 -B\u0304s0 mixing or\nB 0 \u2192 K 0\u2217 \u03b3 gives bounds on \u039b or order 106 GeV.\nThe large suppression of the SM rate, of order A2 \u03bb5 ,\narises from a generalized GIM mechanism (suppressions\nfrom either small masses or small mixing angles). As we\nwill see, MFV guarantees that the same CKM factor appears also in the new physics operator. The A2 \u03bb5 cancels\nout in the ratio, so the estimate in (5) is modified under\nthe MFV hypothesis to\n1+r \u223c 1+\n\n1/\u039b2\n2 )\n1/(16\u03c0 2 MW\n\n2\n\n.\n\n(6)\n\nNow r = 4% gives \u039b 103\u22124 GeV. A comprehensive, detailed analysis of bounds on \u039b an be found in [5].\nSo the only thing left to understand in our example\nis how the MFV principle inserts automatically a factor\nof A2 \u03bb5 into the coefficient of the new physics operator\nin Eq. (4). It is straightforward to implement the MFV\nprinciple using the spurion method. The SM lagrangian\nis invariant under the following combined transformation\n\nonly to a point: we assumed that below the scale of new\nphysics, \u039b, the spectrum is that of the SM with a single higgs doublet. The analysis has to be modified if\nthis is not the case. An interesting example is that of\nthe SM with two higgs doublets. MFV requires that the\nYukawa couplings of the two higgs doublets to quarks be\nrestricted since there can only be two truly independent,\nfundamental matrices that break GF . In the generic case,\nFCNC appear from tree level exchange of neutral higgs\nparticles. There are also new radiative contributions to\nFCNC from charge higgs exchange. Hence some couplings have to be restricted further. This is accomplished\nnaturally by assuming approximate Peccei-Quinn (PQ)\nsymmetry, and that the PQ symmetry violating terms\nare controlled by a new small parameter.\nEven then, the two higgs doublet model has more parameters than the one higgs SM: the ratio of expectation\nvalues of the two higss doublets v2 /v1 \u2261 tan \u03b2 and the\nmasses of three additional scalar particles (one charged\nand two neutral). Some of the interest in these models is from possibly describing the hierarchy of the top\nand bottom masses by a hierarchy in expectations values, tan \u03b2 \u226b 1. Since this requires larger \u03bbD than in the\nsingle higgs SM, FCNC are enhanced.\nThe analysis of the effects of higher dimension operators of the two higgs model is then similar to that of the\none higgs case, with two important distinctions. (i) Coefficients of operators involving down type masses are enhanced by corresponding powers of tan \u03b2, and (ii) There\n\n\f3\nare additional contributions to FCNC mediated by the\nadditional fields, e.g, charged higgs exchange.\n\nIII.\n\nLEPTONS: MLFV\n\nWe do not know why but MFV seems to be operative\nin the quark sector. Surely we need more work to establish that this is accurately true. But in the mean time\nit is clearly interesting to ask if MFV is a more general\nprinciple. If so, we wonder, shouldn't it also apply to the\nlepton sector of the SM? Lepton flavor is violated, as evidenced by neutrino oscillations. It is interesting to investigate if Minimal Lepton Flavor Violation (MLFV) makes\ninteresting predictions of flavor lepton changing neutral\ncurrents of charged lepton, e.g., \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 and \u03bc \u2192 ee\u0113.\nIn particular, we may ask not just about the magnitude\nof these effects but more particularly whether there are\nparticular patterns of flavor violation that may help us\ndecide if indeed MLFV is the underlying structure. If\nthis were the case it would strengthen the notion that\nMFV operates at a very basic level\nThere are two cases to consider[6]. If the neutrinos\nacquire dirac masses the analysis of flavor changing neutral currents proceeds in exactly the same way as for\nthe quark sector. In this case the tiny neutrino mass\nmakes all charged lepton FCNC impossibly small to observe, and for that reason we do not pursue this further.\nThe situation is very different if the neutrinos acquire a\nmajorana mass. A majorana mass is attractive in any\ncase because it can explain the smallness of the neutrino\nmasses through the \"see-saw\" mechanism.\nThe analysis of MLFV for neutrinos with majorana\nmass does not require that we add right handed neutrinos to generate masses: an operator of dimension 5 (see\nbelow, Eq. (9)) can produce the desired see-saw mass.\nTherefore we examine two cases:\n1. Minimal field content (MFC): the same leptonic\nfield content as the SM: three left-handed and lepton doublets LiL and three right-handed charged\nlepton singlets eiR In this case the lepton flavor symmetry group is GLF = SU (3)L \u00d7 SU (3)E . The lepton sector is also invariant under two U (1) symmetries, which can be identified with the total lepton\nnumber, U (1)LN , and the weak hypercharge.\n2. Extended field content (EFC): three right-handed\ni\n, in addition to the SM fields. In this\nneutrinos, \u03bdR\ncase the field content of the lepton sector is very\nsimilar to that of the quark sector, with a maximal\nflavor group GLF \u00d7 SU (3)\u03bdR .\nThis classification is very reasonable if the masses of\nright handed neutrinos, MR , are smaller than the scale\nof new EW-physics, \u039b. But really what we have in\nmind is the extreme opposite case, since we want roughly\nm\u03bd \u223c v 2 /MR \u223c (\u039b/4\u03c0)2 /MR . By considering the two\n\ncases we can examine the difference that arise by assuming that the parameter that controls MLFV is the coefficient of a dimension 5 operator (MFC) or a Yukawa\ninteraction (EFC). However, due to space constraints I\nwill describe here only the MFC and refer the reader to\nRef. [6] for a more detailed description of the EFC.\n\nA.\n\nMinimal Field Content\n\nWe make three assumptions: (i)The breaking of the\nU (1)LN is independent from the breaking of the lepton\nflavor symmetry (GLF ), (ii) The breaking of U (1)LN is\nassociated with a very high scale \u039bLN , much greater than\nthe scale of EW physics, \u039bLN \u226b \u039b, and (iii)There are\nonly two irreducible sources of lepton-flavor symmetry\nij\nbreaking, \u03bbij\ne and g\u03bd , defined by\ni\n\u2020 j\nHeff = \u03bbij\ne \u0113R (H LL ) +\ni j\n\u2192 v\u03bbij\ne \u0113R eL +\n\n1\ng ij (L\u0304ci \u03c42 H)(H T \u03c42 LjL ) + h.c.\n2\u039bLN \u03bd L\n\nv 2 ij ci j\ng \u03bd\u0304 \u03bd + h.c.\n\u039bLN \u03bd L L\n\n(9)\n\nIn the second line we have indicated the mass terms after\nshifting the higgs field by its expectation value. It displays explicitly the see-saw mechanism. The scale \u039bLN\nrather than \u039b appears in the second terms because the\noperator breaks U (1)LN .\nThe principle of MLFV with MFC can be implemented\nmuch like MFV, using the spurion method. The hamiltonian (9) is formally invariant under the combined transij\nformation lepton fields and the matrices \u03bbij\ne and g\u03bd under\nGLF are\nLL \u2192 VL LL\neR \u2192 VR eR\n\n\u03bbe \u2192 VR \u03bbe VL\u2020 ,\n\ng\u03bd \u2192 VL\u2217 g\u03bd VL\u2020 .\n\n(10)\n\nIt is readily seen that the quantity \u2206 \u2261 g\u03bd\u2020 g\u03bd has a simple transformation law and largely controls all FCNC\nof charged leptons (a few four lepton operators involve\nalso the parameter \u03b4 \u2261 g\u03bd [7]). Moreover, up to a\nconstant it is determined by quantities that are measurable at low energies; in the mass eigenstate basis,\n\u2206 = (\u039bLN /v 2 )2 U m2\u03bd U \u2020 (and \u03b4 = (\u039bLN /v 2 )U \u2217 m\u03bd U \u2020 ),\nwhere U is the PMNS matrix and m\u03bd is the diagonal\nneutrino mass matrix. Hence, all FCNC amplitudes are\ngiven in terms of[6, 7] (i)the ratio \u039bLN /\u039b (but not both\nscales independently), (ii)a few operator coefficients of\norder 1, and (iii)low energy measurable (or measured)\nneutrino masses and mixing angles. As a result this setup\nis very predictive. In some cases, like the three radiative\ndecays, \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3, \u03c4 \u2192 e\u03b3 and \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3, the unknown\nparameters completely drop out of ratios of Branching\nfractions. So this scheme is falsifiable.\n\n\f4\nIV.\n\nLL \u2192 V5\u0304 LL\n\u2217\neR \u2192 V10\neR\n\nMFV AND GUT\n\nApplying the principle of MFV to Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) produces interesting predictions. This has\nbeen noted in the particular case of supersymmetric\nGUTs[8] but similar predictions occur more generally[9],\nas described bellow.\nFor definiteness consider GUTs with SU (5) as gauge\ngroup. The 15 fields of one family of quarks and leptons\nfall into a \u03c8 \u223c 5\u0304 and a \u03c7 \u223c 10 representations. Since \u03c8\nand \u03c7 contain both leptons and quarks, the flavor symmetry group of the GUT, SU (3)2 , is smaller than in the\nSM for three generations. As in the case of MFV, we\nassume that the flavor symmetry is broken only by three\nYukawa-like couplings, the ones responsible for quark and\nlepton masses:\nLsym.br. = \u03c8 T \u03bb5 \u03c7H \u2217 + \u03c7T \u03bb10 \u03c7H +\n\n1 T \u2032\n\u03c8 \u03bb5 \u03a3\u03c7H \u2217 (11)\nM\n\nThe first trans-Planckian correction has been included.\nThis is necessary to accommodate the masses of all\nquarks and charged leptons. The effects of this term are\nsmall, very naturally accommodating the observed spectrum. Neutrinos masses can also be included by adding\nthree right handed neutral fields, N . A large Majorana\nmass MR for these,\n\u2206Lsym.br. = N T \u03bb1 \u03c8H + N T MR N\n\n(12)\n\nproduces small, see-saw Majorana masses for the left\nhanded neutrinos: With these additional fields the flavor\ngroup, SU (3)3 , is larger. So the MFV hypothesis applied\nto GUTs is the statement that the SU (3)3 flavor symmetry is broken only by the couplings \u03bb5 , \u03bb\u20325 , \u03bb10 , \u03bb1 , MR . It\nis convenient to trade the parameters \u03bb5 , \u03bb\u20325 , \u03bb10 for the\nlow energy combinations that give masses to quarks and\nleptons, since those are of direct phenomenological relevance, \u03bbu \u223c \u03bb10 , \u03bbd \u223c (\u03bb5 + \u03bb\u20325 ), \u03bbTe \u223c (\u03bb5 \u2212 32 \u03bb\u20325 ).\nAs before, it is simplest to implement MFV in GUTs\nby the spurion method. the transformation rules are:\nQL \u2192 V10 QL\n\u2217\nuR \u2192 V10\nuR\n\u2217\ndR \u2192 V5\u0304 dR\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\u03bbu \u2192 V10\n\u03bbu V10\n\u2020\n\u03bbd \u2192 V5\u0304\u2217 \u03bbd V10\n\n\u03bb1 \u2192 V1\u2217 \u03bb1 V5\u0304\u2020\n\nMR \u2192 V1\u2217 MR V1\u2020\n\n(13)\n\nAs a result of the reduced flavor symmetry, quarks and\nleptons transform together. So in addition to some of\nthe older bilinear building blocks we encountered before,\nlike Q\u0304L \u03bb\u2020u \u03bbu QL , one encounters bilinear invariants that\nmix quark and lepton parameters, like Q\u0304L (\u03bbe \u03bb\u2020e )T QL and\nL\u0304L (\u03bbd \u03bb\u2020d )T LL , where it is understood that the substitution \u03bbe \u2194 \u03bbTd can be made throughout. There are also\nnew interesting leptoquark bilinears that are allowed.\nThe phenomenology of these models is quite reach.\nThe bottom line is the inescapable appearance of lepton flavor changing interaction of charged leptons, much\nas in the case of MLFV above, but now with a richer\nsource of flavor violation. For example the radiative decays \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3, \u03c4 \u2192 e\u03b3 and \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3, are mediated by the\nlow energy effective lagrangian\nLeff =\n\ni\nh\nv\n\u2020\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u2020\n\u2020 T\nc\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n+\nc\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n+\nc\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\u0113\n1\n2\ne\n3\nR\ne 1 1\nu u\nu u d \u03c3 eL F\u03bc\u03bd\n\u039b2\n\nThis is more general than the SUSY-GUT result, so it\nis less specific in its predictions. However there are several interesting aspects to this results. First, depending\non the parameters, this could be dominated by the first\nMLFV-like terms, or by the the SUSY-GUT like term,\nor neither. Secondly, the result is still hierarchical, as it\nwas in the MLFV case. If the second and third terms\ndominate, then the branching amplitudes for \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3,\n\u03c4 \u2192 e\u03b3 and \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3 scale as \u03bb5 m\u03bc : \u03bb3 m\u03c4 : \u03bb2 m\u03c4 , where\nthe mixing parameter is \u03bb \u2248 0.22. And thirdly, the rate\nis typically large, with the branching fraction for \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3\nof order 10\u221212 for \u039b = 10 TeV.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWork supported in part by the Department of Energy\nunder contract DE-FG03-97ER40546.\n\n\u2020\n\u03bbe \u2192 V5\u0304\u2217 \u03bbe V10\n\n[1] B.
