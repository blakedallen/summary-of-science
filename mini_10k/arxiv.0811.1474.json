Using flux maps, polarimetric maps,\nand measurements of the field inclination by comparing the line widths of ion\nand neutral species, we estimate the temperature, mass, magnetic field, and\nthe turbulent kinetic, mean magnetic, and gravitational potential energies, and\npresent a 3D model of the cloud and magnetic field.\nSubject headings: Molecular Clouds, Submillimeter, Polarization, Star Formation\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nPartially ionized material in a molecular cloud will respond to gravitational forces by\nmoving, primarily, along magnetic field lines. If one assumes that the field is not significantly\ntangled by turbulence, one can expect a concentration of material in an oblate core. This\nmodel has been verified by the analysis of polarimetric and photometric data (Dotson et al.\n2009) by Tassis et al. (2008) showing that the field is directed along the short axes of the\ncores. The neutral component of the material will move slowly across field lines toward\nthe center of gravity thus increasing the gravitational field. Where a pinch in the field is\nindicated by a polarization map, one can infer that the gravitational field in the core is\ncompeting with the support provided by the field. Within a critical radius, one expects the\ncloud to collapse.\n1\n\nDissertation submitted to the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of Chicago, in\npartial fulfillment of the requirements for the Ph.D. degree.\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nExamples of pinched fields have been found in Orion (Schleuning 1998) and in NGC1333\n(Girart et al. 2006). In the case of DR21 Main (DR21M), the polarization map extends to\nradii such that the field straightens out as the gravitational field diminishes leaving an\nhourglass field configuration. In this cloud one has an opportunity to estimate the mass\nwithin the collapsing region. We use 350 \u03bcm polarimetry to measure the field as projected\non the sky (\u00a73.1); line width measurements to estimate the inclination of the field to the line\nof sight (\u00a74.1); photometric maps to estimate the mass distribution (\u00a74.3); and the angular\ndispersion of the field vectors to estimate the field strength (\u00a74.4).\n\n2.\n\nDR21\n\nThe giant star forming complex, DR21 (Figure 1) is located in the Cygnus constellation \u223c 3kpc from Earth (Campbell et al. 1982). The southernmost component, DR21M,\nhas a mass of \u223c 20, 000 M\u2299 (Richardson et al. 1989). It contains one of the most energetic star formation outflows detected (Garden et al. 1991; Garden & Carlstrom 1992).\nGarden et al. (1991) measured the mass of the outflow to be 3000 M\u2299 . Observers using\nSpitzer found 5 near-infrared (NIR) sources (see Figure 2) inside DR21M, presumed to be\nprotostars (Kumar et al. 2007; Davis et al. 2007) indicating that regions within the cloud\nare undergoing gravitational collapse. Glenn et al. (1999) at 1.3 mm and Minchin & Murray\n(1994) at 800 \u03bcm have previously measured the polarization of DR21 finding uniform position angles \u223c 25\u25e6 East of North (i.e. B field \u2248 65 \u25e6 West of North). The galactic plane\nis oriented at 42 \u25e6 East of North. Roberts et al. (1997) measured a line-of-sight magnetic\nfield of \u223c 400\u03bcG using HI Zeeman measurements around the dust emission peak and star\nformation regions. The regions observed by Roberts et al. (1997) with 3.5\u03c3 detections are\noutlined in green in Figure 3.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nObservations\nPolarization\n\nObservations, made at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO) with the polarimeter Hertz (Schleuning et al. 1997; Dowell et al. 1998), provided 350 \u03bcm polarization maps of\nthe region. Hertz was later replaced by SHARP (Li et al. 2008), a module mounted ahead\nof the photometer SHARC-II (Dowell et al. 2003) to permit polarization measurements.\nSHARP has a wire cross-grid to split the incoming signal into orthogonal components\nof polarization which are then detected on two 144 pixel subsets of the SHARC-II detector\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n\nFig. 1.- Hertz image (Dotson et al. 2009) of the star forming region DR21. Red vectors (E-vectors) are for measurements better than 3\u03c3 polarization and blue vectors are for\nmeasurements of 2\u03c3 to 3\u03c3. Open circles are locations with a 2\u03c3 upper limit of 1%\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n\nFig. 2.- SHARCII 350 \u03bcm flux map with x's marking locations of Spitzer NIR sources\n(Kumar et al. 2007; Davis et al. 2007)\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\narray. Standard infrared techniques of chopping the secondary mirror to remove sky emission\nand positional offsets to remove gradients in sky emission were used for all the polarimetry\nobservations (Hildebrand et al. 2000). The chopping direction was azimuthal with a throw\nof 300\u2032\u2032 . To avoid chopping into the adjacent cloud, DR21OH, all observations were made\nwhen the chop throw was > 30\u25e6 from north-south on the sky A half-wave plate was rotated\nto four different angles separated by 22.5\u25e6. Each observation cycle consisted of a set of\nobservations at the 4 half-wave plate angles. The signals from the two 144 pixel arrays were\nthen combined to give the polarization and photometric signals as described by Kirby et al.\n(2005). The polarization and flux signals are given by\nPolarization Signal = H \u2212 V\nFlux Signal = H + V\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nwhere H and V are the horizontal and vertical components of the signal. The Stokes parameter, Q, was calculated from the difference of the polarization signals of the 1st and 3rd angle\nin the cycle, while the parameter U was calculated from the difference of the polarization\nsignals of the 2nd and 4th angle. The source flux, I, was determined by the average of the\nflux signals from the 4 half-wave plate positions. The Q, U, and I from each cycle were then\ncombined after correcting for changes in attenuation and sky noise. Due to the lack of an\ninstrument rotator, this combination had to be done a new way. The corrected Q, U, and\nI from all of the cycles were combined to form an irregularly sampled map. This map was\nthen smoothed to a resolution of \u223c 10\u2032\u2032 (for more detail see Houde & Vaillancourt (2007).\nThe observations were made in 7 fields spaced by 45\u2032\u2032. Each field was observed with\na 4-point dither on corners of a square 10\u2032\u2032 wide in Right Ascension and Declination. A\nfew additional observations were taken to fill in areas of low signal to noise in the above 7\nfields. The data were corrected for instrument polarizations of \u223c 0.3 \u22120.5% (Li et al. (2008),\nVaillancourt et al, in preparation)\nThe SHARP observations were taken on 2006 July 15-19 during intermediate weather\n(\u03c4225GHz \u2248 0.07 \u2212 0.08 corresponding to 1.7-2.0 mm zenith water vapor). The SHARP\npolarization data set shows 1270 sky positions with a signal to noise \u2265 3. The beam size\nof SHARP is \u223c 4\u00d7 the pixel size. Limiting the sample so there is no beam overlap leaves\n78 measurements. The median value of the polarization is 2.4% ranging between 0.37% and\n13%. Half of the points have a signal to noise better than 4.7. At this value, the accuracy of\nthe position angle of the polarization vectors is \u223c 6.5\u25e6 . The direction of polarization shows a\npinched or hourglass shape (see Figure 3). The axis of symmetry of the hourglass is inclined\n\u223c 15\u25e6 East of North (determined by model see 4.5.\nThe results tabulated by Dotson et al. (2009) were obtained with the polarimeter, Hertz\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n\nFig. 3.- 350 \u03bcm SHARP(red) and Hertz(blue dotted) polarization of DR21M.

Green contours show the locations larger than a SHARCII pixel with 3.5\u03c3 Zeeman results from Roberts et al. (1997)\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n(Figure 3 blue dotted vectors). The Hertz measurements were taken on three observing runs,\n1997 April 18-27, 1997 September 18-26, and 2001 April 10-16.\n\n3.2.\n\nHeterodyne Measurements\n\nThe polarimetry measurements from SHARP and Hertz are supplemented with 345\nGHz heterodyne measurements of ion and neutral molecular line widths from the CSO. The\nheterodyne measurements were taken on 2006 July 12-13 (\u03c4225GHz \u2248 0.1). The inclination of\nthe field at eleven points within the pinched region was determined from measurements of line\nwidths of neutral and ionized molecules of comparable mass. The heterodyne measurements\nof the J\u21924-3 transition in HCN and HCO+ were made using only on/off position differencing\n(Houde et al. 2000a,b). The data were reduced using the CLASS program as part of the\nGILDAS package of programs (http://www.iram.fr/IRAMFR/GILDAS). Each of the lines\nwas smoothed to half of the natural resolution using the CLASS routine SMOOTH to improve\nthe signal to noise. One of the positions was removed due to low signal to noise. Another\nposition was unusable because bandwidth of the instrument was insufficient to image the\nentire line.\nThe spectrum at each position was then fit by a multi-Gaussian model (Figure 4) to\ndetermine the line widths (more properly the standard deviation \u03c3v ). Multiple Gaussians\nwere used to account for the self-absorption seen in most of the positions, and for onesided outflows, which can cause an artificial reduction in line widths if not accounted for\nproperly. The effects from broad outflows were removed from two locations. The fits\nwere done using the XGaussfit program from the FUSE package of software for IDL (\nhttp://fuse.pha.jhu.edu/analysis/fuse idl tools.html). Results of the fits are given in Table\n1.\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nResults\n\nInclination Angle\n\nHoude et al. (2000a,b) investigated the effect of a magnetic field on the velocities and\nions in a partially ionized flow (not necessarily an outflow or jet but any situation where\nlocal mean velocity is not zero). For a significantly strong field, the ions were forced into\ngyromagnetic rotation about the magnetic field instead of following the flow. This rotation\nled to a reduction in line width and suppression of high velocity wings. The line widths\nwere derived for both the neutrals and ions. The ratio of the linewidths depends only on the\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nTable 1.

Assuming that the neutral component of the material is\nH2 (mean molecular mass of 2.3), the square of the ratio of the ion to neutral line width is\ngiven in terms of the angle with the line of sight, \u03b1, by\n2\n\u03c3l,i\ne cos \u03b12 + f (0.16 cos \u03b12 + 0.84 sin \u03b12 /2)(mi /\u03bci \u2212 1)\u22121\n\u2248\n2\n\u03c3l,n\ne cos \u03b12 + f sin \u03b12 /2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere\n1 \u2212 cos3 \u2206\u03b8\n,\n6\n2 \u2212 3 cos \u2206\u03b8 + cos3 \u2206\u03b8\nf=\n,\n6\ne=\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nand mi and \u03bci are the ion mass and the reduced mass respectively. The neutral flows are\nmodeled as symmetrical and contained within a cone of width \u2206\u03b8 centered on magnetic\nfield direction (symmetry axis, see Figure 5). All values of \u03b1 must satisfy the condition\nP/Pmax \u2264 sin \u03b12 where Pmax is the maximum polarization seen by Hertz (10 % Houde et al.\n(2004)).\nAlthough the cone half width, \u2206\u03b8, can, in principle, be determined by finding the curve\nthat best fits the above condition on P/Pmax , the data for DR21 do not provide significant\nconstraints on this quantity. The values of \u03b1 presented in Table 1 are computed assuming\n\u2206\u03b8 = 45\u25e6 . The inclination with the line of sight decreases toward the center of DR21 as\nwould be expected for a magnetic field in the center of a gravitationally contracting region\nwith an axis near the plane of the sky. Inclination angles for points located at the edge of\nthe cloud, where the gravitational pinch has had only a small effect, should approximate the\ninclination of the cloud's mean B field. These points for DR21 give an estimate of \u223c 70\u25e6\ninclined to the line of sight or \u223c 20\u25e6 to the plane of the sky.\nChoosing the wrong value of \u2206\u03b8 leads to a systematic error in the calculation of each\nangle, but the difference between angles is not significantly affected. The overall trend\nof decreasing angle toward the center of the cloud remains. If, instead, we had assumed\n\u2206\u03b8 = 90\u25e6 , the values shown in the table would decrease by \u223c 15\u25e6 but the overall trend\ntoward decreasing inclinations toward the center would not change.\n\n4.2.\n\nTemperature and Optical Depth\n\nThe spectral energy distribution at 350 and 850 \u03bcm was fitted to give estimates of\nthe dust temperature and optical depth at 350 \u03bcm. The 850 \u03bcm map was acquired from\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.- Illustration of flow of neutral material. All flows (velocity vectors) are contained\nwithin a cone of width \u2206\u03b8 centered on the symmetry axis defined by the magnetic field (see\nFigure 2 of Houde et al. (2002). Length of vectors is arbitrary as magnitude and direction\nare assumed independent.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.- Polarization vectors with known 3-dimensional spatial orientation. The angle of\nthe vectors is drawn at the angle of the magnetic field in the plane of the sky. The length\nof the vector is proportional to the angle, \u03b1, of the magnetic field with respect to the line of\nsight. The grayscale background is from SHARC-II.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nthe SCUBA online archive 2 (Project ID: m02bu47). The SHARC-II map at 350 \u03bcm was\nsmoothed and repixelated to match the 850 \u03bcm map. The intensity at frequency \u03bd and\ncorresponding wavelength \u03bb was then modeled as\n2\n\nI\u03bd = B\u03bd (T )(1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4350 (350/\u03bb) ),\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the exponent gives the atmospheric transmission at frequency \u03bd as determined from\nthe transmission at 350 \u03bcm, and B\u03bd (T ) is the Planck function at frequency \u03bd and temperature\nT . An example fit to the data for the center of DR21 is shown in Figure 7. This formula\nassumes the cloud is optically thin at the wavelengths used. The ratio of the the 350 \u03bcm\nflux to the 850 \u03bcm is constant throughout the majority of the cloud (\u223c 15) with a discrete\njump at the edges of the cloud (\u223c 25) and a dip in the center (\u223c 8). The constancy of the\nratio implies optical thinness except at the center where the ratio drops.\nTemperatures at the peak were \u223c 20 K and went up to \u223c 25 K in the cloud. The edges\nof the cloud where the ratio increased had higher temperature (30-50 K). The 25 K region of\nthe cloud extended along a rough northeast-southwest direction similar to the direction of the\noutflow. The optical depth showed a similar trend with a value at the peak greater than 1.\nThe optical depth quickly drops below 1 indicating that all but the bright peak areas of DR21\nmain are optically thin at 350 \u03bcm, as expected from the flux ratios. Harvey et al. (1986)\nfound temperatures from 50 \u03bcm and 100 \u03bcm flux maps to be \u223c 50 K. These wavelengths\nmay be coming from a different environment with a different temperature. Supporting a\nmulti-environment hypothesis, Richardson et al. (1989) found a 350 \u03bcm to 800 \u03bcm ratio of\n\u223c 16 at DR21OH with a corresponding temperature of \u223c 25 K in regions given to be \u223c 37\nK by Harvey et al. (1986). Throughout the rest of the paper, we used temperatures of 20-25\nK from the SHARP and SCUBA fluxes.\n\n4.3.\n\nMass\n\nThe mass of cloud within a specified region of a cloud can be determined from its\ntemperature and far infrared flux (Hildebrand 1983)\nM=\n\nF D2\nCM\nB\u03bd (T )\n\n(7)\n\nwhere F is the flux, D is the distance to the cloud, and\nCM = [N(H + H2 )/\u03c4 (\u03bd)]mH \u03bc = 1.2 * 1025 (350/400)2mH \u03bc,\n2\n\nhttp://www2.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/jcmt\n\n(8)\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nwhere \u03c4 (\u03bd) is the optical depth of the cloud at frequency \u03bd. Within a radius of \u223c 1 pc (size\nof SHARP map in E-W direction), DR21 main has a mass of \u223c 25, 000M\u2299 , comparing nicely\nto the \u223c 20, 000M\u2299 found by Richardson et al. (1989).\n4.4.\n\nMagnetic Field Strength\n\nChandrasekhar & Fermi (1953) described a method to estimate the magnetic field in the\nplane of the sky. This method related the dispersion of the direction of starlight polarization\nfrom a straight line to the strength of the magnetic field,\nr\n4\u03c0\u03c1 \u03c3obs (v)\nBplaneof sky =\n(9)\n3\n\u03c3\u03b2\nwhere \u03c1 is the density of the gas, \u03c3obs (v) is the observed line of sight velocity dispersion, and\n\u03c3\u03b2 is the dispersion in polarization direction in the plane of the sky. The weaker the field,\nthe greater the dispersion of the polarization vector.\nThe dispersion of the polarization vectors will be overestimated if it is taken with respect\nto the mean field. To determine the dispersion about the local magnetic field one must take\ninto account the inclination of the mean field (\u00a74.1) and the structure of the large scale\nfield due to non-turbulent effects such as gravitational collapse, expanding HII regions, and\ndifferential rotation (Hildebrand et al. submitted to ApJ). A polarization map usually shows\na smoothly-varying pattern of vectors, therefore at separations small compared to the cloud\n\u221a\ndiameter, the 2-point angular correlation function ( <\u2206\u03b2 2 >) of position angles should\nincrease almost linearly as shown in the bottom panel of Figure 8. The linear portion would\nhave a zero-intercept if there were no measurement error and no turbulence. Both effects will\ncause the whole 2-point correlation to be displaced upward (except at values < correlation\nlength of turbulence which is expected to be much less than the SHARP or Hertz resolution\nof DR21). The y-intercept, b, of the best fit line is then the quadratic sum of the estimate of\nthe dispersion, \u03c3\u03b2 and the measurement error, \u03c3m e. A cross correlation of repeat observations\ngives the estimate of the measurement error (value at 0 separation) and an estimate of the\nquadratic sum of measurement error and turbulent dispersion (intercept of best fit line to\nlinear region at small non-zero separation)\nb=\n\nq\n\n2 .\n\u03c3\u03b22 + \u03c3me\n\n(10)\n\nFigure 8 shows the correlation function for two subsets of the Hertz data set. The subsets\nwere constructed by taking every other raw data file starting with file 1 for subset 1 and file 2\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nfor subset 2. The line best fit to the linear region of the correlation function has an intercept\nof 9.\u25e6 3. The value of the correlation function at zero separation is 7.\u25e6 6 giving an estimate of\n5.\u25e6 3 for the turbulent dispersion. Using the Chandrasekhar and Fermi method formula with\ncorrection factor from Ostriker et al. (2001) gives a plane of the sky magnetic field of 3.1\nmG where \u03c3obs (v) is the observed line of sight velocity dispersion of HCN measured to be\n4.2kms\u22121 and \u03c1 is the mean density calculated from the mass in \u00a74.3 to be 4.4x10\u221219 gcm\u22123 .\nThe method of data acquisition of SHARP prevents repeat observations of the same\nlocation (caused by lack of instrument rotator) preventing that sample from being split as\ndone for Hertz. However, the mean of the individual errors on the angles give a good estimate\nfor the measurement error (7.\u25e6 2 to 7.\u25e6 6 for Hertz). Using that method of estimating the mean\nerror and fitting a line to the linear region of the correlation function gives a magnetic field\nestimate of 2.5 mG using SHARP data (dispersion of 6.\u25e6 6).\nUsing the measurement of 400 \u03bcG for the line of sight magnetic field by Roberts et al.\n(1997) and taking a \u223c 3 mG field in the plane of the sky gives a total magnetic field of\n\u223c 3 mG inclined to the plane of the sky at \u223c 10\u25e6 . This estimate of the angle is probably\nlow due to the Zeeman measurement being from HI, which exists at lower density than the\ndust we observe in polarization so the field strength is also likely lower there. Taking the\nscaling of Heiles & Crutcher (2005) and the density of the region observed in HI as \u2265 103 ,\nthe angle with respect to the plane of the sky is \u2264 53\u25e6 . For a density of 104 cm\u22123 , the\nangle would be \u223c 20\u25e6 Roberts et al. (1997) assumed that the magnetic field was less than\n1 mG because unless the field was very uniform, the field would have bent somewhere such\nthat they detected a 1 mG field. The dust polarization measurements show a field that is\nvery uniform implying the field could be larger than 1 mG and not detected in the Zeeman\nobservations.\n\n4.5.\n\n3-Dimensional Model\n\nA three dimensional model of the flux and magnetic field was constructed and fit to the\nobserved flux and polarization data. The flux was modeled as a Gaussian ellipsis of the form\nx2 y 2 + z 2\n\u2212\n],\n(11)\na2\nb2\nwhere x is coordinate along the symmetry axis of the magnetic field, y and z are the other\ntwo Cartesian coordinates, and a and b are widths of the Gaussians to be fit. The magnetic\nfield was modeled as\n!\nd cx2\ny\nd\ncx2\nz\nB = Bx , ( 2\n,\n(12)\n)p\n, (\n)p\ndx x + d\ny 2 + z 2 dx x2 + d\ny2 + z2\nF \u221d exp[\u2212\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nwhere\nBx \u221d\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nF dx.\n\n(13)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThis form was chosen to give a magnetic field with the shape of an hourglass that straightened\nat large distance from the center. The magnetic field strength in the x direction in the\nmidplane was set proportional to the column density. Assuming flux freezing, the magnetic\nfield strength in the x direction for locations outside the midplane was set to a value in the\nmidplane that is found by tracing the field line back to the midplane. The field in the y-z\nplane was assumed radial and the strength was found from the strength in the x direction\nand the overall magnetic field direction. The flux and magnetic field strengths were then\nrotated and summed along the line of sight. The values of a, b, c, and d were then set to\ngive the best fit to the flux and the magnetic field direction determined by the polarization\nmeasurements. The best fit values were a = 5, b = 15, c = 10, d = 90 (units for a, b, c, d\nare SHARP pixels = 2.\u2032\u2032 375, 20\u25e6 for the angle of the magnetic field with the plane of the sky,\nand 15\u25e6 East of North for the angle of the projected minor axis on the plane of the sky. The\nfit for the magnetic field direction was quite good (chi-squared of \u223c 2). The flux fit was\npoor as DR21-Main is not an exact ellipse. Figure 9 shows the model vectors along with the\nSHARP vectors. The angle with the plane of the sky is somewhat higher than found in \u00a74.4\nbut agrees well with the measured inclination angles farthest from the center (see \u00a74.1).\n4.6.\n\nGravitational and Magnetic Potential Energies\n\nUsing the mass and magnetic field estimates discussed in \u00a74.3, \u00a74.4, and the 3D model\npresented in \u00a74.5, one can estimate the dependence on radius of the gravitational and magnetic potential energies. The gravitational potential energy of a flattened centrally condensed\nspheroid at a radius R centered on the peak of the cloud is\nEgrav\n\n3aGM 2\n=\n,\n5R\n\n(14)\n\nand the magnetic energy of the uniform field is given by\nEmag =\n\nB 2 R3 b\n,\n6\n\n(15)\n\nwhere the values a = 1.2 and b = 0.3 and are calculated by setting the energies equal\nwhen the mass to magnetic flux ratio is the critical value (McKee et al. 1993). B is scaled\naccording the model in \u00a74.5 and normalized such that the energy inside 1 pc is the same as\nfor the mean field calculated in \u00a74.4. By comparing large scale polarization maps to with\nmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulations, Novak et al. (2007) found that the ratios of\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nthe uniform to fluctuating magnetic field in the clouds NGC 6334 and G333.6-0.2 were in the\nrange 0.6-2.0. Figure 10 shows the gravitational and magnetic potential energies (assuming a\nratio between uniform to fluctuating field of 1) versus radius. Extrapolating the gravitational\npotential energy curve to find the radius at which the two energies are equal gives an estimate\nof \u223c 1.2 parsec. The dotted line in Figure 10 shows turbulent energy calculated from the\naverage HCN line widths of 4.2 km/s and assuming the velocities are isotropic. The sum of\nthese two energies is the dotted-dashed line and intersects the gravitational energy curve at\n0.7 parsecs. One would then expect the critical radius to be between 0.7 and 1.2 parsecs. The\ncritical radius should not be regarded as the radius which is supported against collapse since\nthe virial theorem can not be applied in this way to magnetic clouds (Mouschovias 1987, 1991;\nDib et al. 2007). Figure 12 shows a plot of the mass to magnetic flux ratio versus radius.\nThe ratio is in units of the critical value of the ratio defined by Mouschovias & Spitzer (1976)\n\u221a\nM/\u03a6B = c\u03a6 / G,\n(16)\nwhere c\u03a6 is taken to be 0.12 (Tomisaka et al. 1988). The ratio dips below the critical ratio\nat \u223c 1.2 parsec. The mass inside this region is \u223c 25, 000M\u2299 (\u00a74.3) which is approximately\nthe entire mass of the cloud. Figure 11 shows the polarization vectors with circles at the\ncritical radii with and without turbulent energy. The magnetic field configuration changes\nat around these radii from the pinched structure to the east-west mean direction (see Figure\n3). This geometry implies that the cloud is relatively stable against collapse at these radii,\nimplying that the magnetic field is providing a significant amount of support against collapse.\nHowever the presence of protostars are radii greater than 1.2 parsec in Figure 11 suggests\nthat the true picture may be more complex.\n\n5.\n\nSummary\n\nWe present a three-dimensional model of the molecular cloud DR21 (Main). Polarimetry\nat 350 \u03bcm has provided a map of the magnetic field as projected on the plane of the sky; line\nobservations of ion and neutral molecules have provided measurements of the inclination of\nthe field to the line of sight; photometry has provided column densities and 350\u03bcm/850\u03bcm\ncolor temperatures.\nA 3-dimensional model of an hourglass configuration magnetic field inclined to the line\nof sight is fit to the observations. We find a pinched field with an axis of 10\u25e6 -20\u25e6 from the\nplane of the sky. The mean field strength is \u223c 3 mG. The gravitational potential energy is\nequivalent to energies from support mechanisms (magnetic field and turbulence) at a radius\nbetween \u223c 0.8pc \u2212 1.1pc, a region encompassing \u223c 20, 000M\u2299 .\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nI am grateful to my adviser Roger Hildebrand and our collaborators Michael Attard,\nDavid Chuss, Jackie Davidson, Jessie Dotson, Darren Dowell, Martin Houde, Megan Krejny,\nLerothodi Leeuw, Hua-bai Li, Giles Novak, Hiroko Shinnaga, Konstantinos Tassis and John\nVaillancourt for support, observing assistance, and critical comments on drafts of this paper.\nObservations at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory would not have been possible without\nthe assistance of the CSO staff.
