The starting point can be traced back to the nonlinear analysis works of\nA. Ambrosetti, A. Bahri, V. Coti-Zelati, P. Majer, J. Mawin, P.H. Rabinowitz, E.\nSerra and S. Terracini (among others) issued around 1990 [4, 26, 1, 2, 3, 24, 23, 31];\nmethods were developed that could deal with singular potential and particular symmetry groups of the functional. For other approaches one can see also I. Stewart\n[32] and C. Moore [28]. The next new wave of results has followed the remarkable\nA. Chenciner and R. Montgomery's proof of the \"figure-eight\" periodic solution of\nthe three-body problem in the case of equal masses [13], where collisions and singularities were excluded by the computation of the action level on test curves and a\nnon-commutative finite group of symmetries was taken as the constraint for a global\nequivariant variational approach. In order to generalize the equivariant variational\nmethod (that is, to restrict the action functional to the space of equivariant loops)\nto a new range of applicability S. Terracini and the author in [19] could make use\nof C. Marchal's averaging idea [25] and prove that local minimizers of the action\nfunctional are collisionless, provided an algebraic condition on the symmetry group\n(termed the rotating circle property) holds. Meanwhile, symmetry groups and various approaches to level estimates or local variations have been found, together with\nthe corresponding symmetric minimizers, and published by many authors (see for\nexample [6, 7, 18], [8, 9], [14], [29], [30], [33], [17, 12], and [21]. The aim of this article is to provide a unified framework for the construction and classification problem\n1\n\n\fand at the same time to extend the application range of the averaging and blow-up\ntechniques. More precisely, when dealing with the problem of classifying in a constructive way finite symmetry groups for the n-body problem one has to face three\nissues. First, it is of course preferrable to have an equivalence relation defined between groups, which rules out differences thought as non\u2013substantial. Second, one\nhas to find a suitable decomposition of a symmetry group into a sum of (something\nlike) irreducible components. The way of decomposing things depends upon the context. In our settings we could choose an orthogonal representations decomposition\n(as direct sum of G-modules) or as permutations decomposition, or a mixture of the\ntwo. Third, it would be interesting to deduce from the irreducible components, from\ntheir (algebraic and combinatorial) properties, some consequente properties of actionminimizing periodic orbits (like being collisionless, existence, being homographic or\nnon-homographic, and the like). The purpose of the paper is to give a procedure\nfor constructing all symmetry groups of the n-body problem (in three-dimensional\nspace, but of course the planar case can be done as a particular case) according to\nthese three options, with the main focus on the existence of periodic or quasi-periodic\nnon-colliding solutions. The main result can be used to list groups that might be\nconsidered as the elementary building blocks for generic symmetry groups yielding\ncollisionless minimizers.\nThe first reduction will be obtained by defining the cover of a symmetry group\n(that is, the group acting on the time line instead of the time circle) and considering\nequivalent groups with the same equivariant periodic trajectories (up to repeating\nloops). Also, it is possible to consider equivalent those symmetry groups that differ\nby a change in the action functional (the angular speed). Using this simple escamotage it is possible to dramatically reduce the cardinality of the symmetry groups\nand to deal with a finite number of (numerable) families of groups for every n. The\nnext step is to exploit the fact that any finite permutation representation can be\ndecomposed \u00e0 la Burnside into the disjoint sum of transitive (or, equivalently, homogeneous) permutation representations. This decomposition requires the definition\nof a suitably crafted sum of Lagrangean symmetry groups, which will be written in\nd data (to be defined later) yielded by the group. The transiterm of Krh and Krh\ntive decomposition allows to state the main result, which can be written as follows.\nDefinition and notation of course refer to the body of the paper.\nTheorem A. Let G be a symmetry group with a colliding G-symmetric Lagrangean\nlocal minimizer. If G\u2217 is the T-isotropy group of the colliding time restricted to the\nindex subset of colliding bodies, then G\u2217 cannot act trivially on the index set; if the\npermutation isotropy of a transitive component of G\u2217 is trivial, than the image of G\u2217\nin O(3) cannot be one of the following: I, Cp (for p \u2265 1), Dp (for p \u2265 2), T , O, Y ,\n\u2032\nP2p\n, Cph .\nThis result allows to clarify and to extend the above-mentioned rotating circle\nproperty; in the proof we show how with a simple application of the averaging Marchal technique on space equivariant spheres one can deduce that for the group actions\nlisted in the statement minimizers are collisionless. It is also worth mentioning that\nthe transitive decomposition approach has two interesting consequences: from one\nhand it is possible to determine whether the hypothesis of Theorem A is fulfilled\n2\n\n\fsimply by computing the space-representations of the transitive decomposition of\nthe maximal T-isotropy subgroups of the symmetry group (thus making the task\nof finding rotating circles unnecessary); on the other hand a machinery for finding\nexamples of symmetry groups can be significantly improved by allowing the construction of actions using smaller and combinatorial components. Even if feasible, a\ncomplete classification of all symmetry groups satistying the hypotheses which imply collision-less minimizers and coercivity would just result into an unreasonably\nlong unreadable list. We decided to formulate only the method that can be used for\nsuch generation, leaving a few examples in the last section to illustrate it in simple\ncases. Therefore the paper is basically organized as a multi-step proof of Theorem\nA, together with the introduction and explanation of the necessary preliminaries,\nresults and definitions. In sections 2 and 3 we will review the notation about Euclidean symmetry groups and the main properties of Lagrangean symmetry groups.\nIn section 4 the definition of transitive decomposition and disjoint sum of symmetry\ngroups is carried out: this is the one of the main step in the construction process.\nFurthermore, in section 5 a simple proof allows to extend the averaging technique\nto all orientation-preserving finite isotropy groups. Together with the rotating circle\nproperty and the classification of finite subgroups of SO(3) this will yield the method\non avoiding collisions. The analysis of possible transitive component is then carried\nout in section 6, according to the previous definition and results. At the end, in\nsection 7 the few examples mentioned above are shown, together with pictures of the\ncorresponding approximate minimizers.\n\n2\n\nPreliminaries and notation\n\nWe denote by O(d) the orthogonal group in dimension d, that is, the group of d \u00d7 d\northogonal matrices over the real field. The symbol \u03a3n denotes the permutation\ngroup on n elements {1, . . . , n}. Space isometries are named rotation, reflection,\ncentral inversion and rotatory reflection (actually a central inversion is a particular\nrotatory reflection). We recall, following the terminology and notation of [16] (page\n99, pages 270\u2013277) and [15] (appendix A, pages 351\u2013367; see also [5] and [27]), that\nthe non-trivial finite subgroups of SO(3) are the following: Cp (the cyclic group\ngenerated by a rotation of order p, for p \u2265 2, with a single p-gonal axis), Dp (the\ndihedral group of order 2p, with p horizontal digonal axes and a vertical p-gonal\naxis, with p \u2265 2), T \u223c\n= A4 (the tetrahedral group of order 12, with 4 trigonal axes\nand 3 mutually orthogonal digonal axes), O \u223c\n= S4 (the octahedral group of order 24,\nwith 4 trigonal axes, the same as T , and 3 mutually orthogonal tetragonal axes; it is\nisomorphic to the orientation-preserving symmetry group of the cube and contains\nthe tetrahedral group as a normal subgroup of index 2) and Y \u223c\n= A5 (the icosahedral\ngroup of order 60, with 6 pentagonal axes, 10 trigonal axes and 15 digonal axes).\nThe dihedral group D2 is a normal subgroup of T of index 3.\nThe finite subgroups of O(3) are index 2 extensions of the groups listed above.\nLet I denote the group generated by the central inversion \u22121 \u2208 O(3). Since O(3) =\nI \u00d7 SO(3) and I is the center of O(3), finite groups containing the central inversion\nare I, I \u00d7 Cp , I \u00d7 Dp , I \u00d7 T , I \u00d7 O and I \u00d7 Y .\nThe remaining mixed groups are those not containing the central inversion: C2p Cp\n3\n\n\fTable 1: Finite subgroups of SO(3), their normalizers in SO(3) and generators (the\ngenerators of the normalizer are obtaining adding the generator of the fourth column\nto the generators of the second column)\nName\nSymbol Order Gen.

Groups generated\nby reflections (that is, Coxeter groups) are Dp Cp (with p \u2265 1), D2p Dp (with p odd),\nI \u00d7 Dp (with p even), OT , I \u00d7 O, I \u00d7 Y .\nFinally, note that the G-orbit of a point in general position in R3 is a regular\np-agon for G = Cp but it is not a regular polygon for G = Dp or if G is a polyhedral\ngroup (full or rotation). For the groups I \u00d7 Cp and C2p Cp , the G-orbit of a point (in\ngeneral position in R3 ) is the set of vertices of a prism in p is even and G = I \u00d7 Cp\nor if p is odd and G = C2p Cp . It is an antiprism (also known as twisted prism) if p\nis odd and G = I \u00d7 Cp or p is even and G = C2p Cp . Therefore such groups might\nbe called prism/antiprism groups correspondingly. In the Schoenflies notation the\nantiprism group of order 2p is denoted by S2p and the prism group of order 2p by\nCph .

Let T be the\ncircle of length T = |T|. A function T \u2192 X is a T -periodic path in X. By loops in\nX we mean the elements of the Sobolev space \u039b = H 1 (T, X), i.e. all L2 functions\nT \u2192 X with L2 -derivative. The aim is to find periodic (in an inertial frame or in a\nuniformly rotating frame) orbits for the n-body problem: they can be obtained as\ncritical points of the Lagrangian action functional\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nZ\nX\n\uf8ecX mi\n\uf8f7\n(3.1)\nA\u03c9 = \uf8ed\n|\u1e8bi (t) + \u03a9xi (t)|2 +\nmi mj |xi (t) \u2212 xj (t)|\u2212\u03b1 \uf8f8 dt,\n2\nT\ni<j\ni\u2208n\ni,j\u2208n\n\n5\n\n\fwhere \u03a9 is the anti-symmetric 3 \u00d7 3 matrix defined by the relation \u03a9v = \u03c9 \u00d7 v for\nevery v \u2208 R3 , with the vector \u03c9 \u2208 R3 representing the rotation axis of the rotating\nframe and its norm |\u03c9| the angular velocity. The domain of the functional A\u03c9\nis \u039b = H 1 (T, X) (of course, allowing a range with infinite value). Any collisionless\ncritical point is in fact a C 2 solution of the corresponding Euler-Lagrange, or Newton,\nequations under a homogeneous graviational potential of degree \u2212\u03b1, which is periodic\nin the rotating frame.\nNow consider a group G acting orthogonally on T, R3 and permuting the indices\nn. In other words, consider three homomorphims \u03c4 , \u03c1 and \u03c3 from G to O(T), O(3)\nand \u03a3n respectively. The group G can be seen as subgroup (possibly mod a normal\nsubgroup) of the direct product O(T)\u00d7O(3)\u00d7\u03a3n under the monomorphism \u03c4 \u00d7\u03c1\u00d7\u03c3,\nand the three homomorphisms can be recovered as projections onto the first, second\nand third factor of the direct product. Given \u03c1 and \u03c3, it is customary to define an\naction on the configuration space X by the rule (\u2200g \u2208 G), x\u03c3(g)i = \u03c1(g)xi . We will\ndenote simply by gx the value of g * x under this action of G. In the same way,\nthe action of G on T and X induces an action on the functions T \u2192 X by the rule\n(\u2200g \u2208 G), x(\u03c4 (g)t) = gx, and therefore \u039b is a G-equivariant vector space (the action\nof G is orthogonal under the standard Hilbert metric on \u039b).\n(3.2) Definition. A subgroup of O(T) \u00d7 O(3) \u00d7 \u03a3n is termed symmetry group. It\nwill be termed a symmetry group of the Lagrangian action functional A\u03c9 if it leaves\nthe value of the action A\u03c9 (3.1) invariant.\nNote that if i, j \u2208 n are indices and gi = j for some element g \u2208 G, then it has\nto be mi = mj . More generally, consider the decomposition of n into (transitive)\nG-orbits, also known as transitive decomposition. Indices in the same G-orbit must\nshare the value of the mass and, furthermore, the trasitive decomposition yields an\northogonal splitting of the configuration space:\n(3.3)\n\nX = (X1 + Xg1 + . . . ) \u2295 (X2 + Xg2 + . . . ) \u2295 . . . ,\n\nwhere each Xj is a copy of R3 and each summand grouped by brackets is given by\na transitive G-orbit in n. This transitive decomposition is nothing but the standard\ndecomposition of a permutation representation in the Burnside ring A(G).\n(3.4) Definition. Consider a symmetry group G. A vector v \u2208 R3 is a rotation\naxis for G if (\u2200g \u2208 G)gv \u2208 {\u00b1v} (that is, the line hvi \u2282 R3 is G-invariant) and the\norientation G-representation on the time circle (that is, det(\u03c4 )) coincides with the\norientation representation on the orthogonal plane of v (that is, det(\u03c1) det(v)).\nWe recall from [18] (proposition 2.15) that if \u03c9 is a rotation axis for a symmetry\ngroup G (and the values of the masses are compatible with the transitive decomposition (3.3)) then G is a symmetry group of the action functional A\u03c9 . The converse\nholds, after a straightforward proof, for linear or orthogonal actions.\n(3.5) In case the group has a rotation axis it is termed group of type R. If the\nsymmetry group G is not of type R, then all G-equivariant loops have zero angular\nmomentum.\n6\n\n\fProof. The proof an analogous proposition for 3 bodies can be found in [18], proposition 4.2; the details are given for 3 bodies, but it can be trivially generalized to\nthe case of n bodies: if J denotes the angular momentum of the G-equivariant path\nx(t), for every g \u2208 G the formula\nJ(gt) = det(\u03c1(g)) det(\u03c4 (g))\u03c1(g)J(t)\nholds, and hence the angular momentum J (which is constant) belongs to the\nsubspace V in R3 fixed by the G-representation det(\u03c4 ) det(\u03c1)\u03c1. But if V 6= 0,\nthen there is a non-trivial vector v \u2208 R with the property that for every g \u2208 G,\ndet(\u03c4 (g)) det(\u03c1(g))\u03c1(g)v = v. The orientation representation on the plane orthogonal if v denotes the representation on hvi and \u03c12 the representation on its orthogonal\ncompmlement, it follows that det(\u03c4 (g)) det(\u03c12 (g)) det(v) det(v) = 1, and hence that\ndet(\u03c4 ) = det(\u03c12 ): the direction spanned by v is a rotation axis, which contradicts\nthe hypothesis.\nq.e.d.\nLet Iso(R) denote the group of (affine) isometries of the time line R, generated\nby translations and reflections. For every T > 0 there is a surjective projection\ne its cover in\nIso(R) \u2192 O(T), where T = R/T Z . Let G be a symmetry group and G\nIso(R) \u00d7 O(3) \u00d7 \u03a3n , that is the pre-image of G via the projection\nIso(R) \u00d7 O(3) \u00d7 \u03a3n \u2192 O(T) \u00d7 O(3) \u00d7 \u03a3n .\n\nIt is easy to see that there is a canonical isomorphism\ne\nH 1 (R, X)G \u223c\n= H 1 (T, X)G\n\ne\nand hence that we can consider solutions of the n-body problem which are Gequivariant loops instead of the periodic solutions of the n-body problem which\nare G-equivariant. Assume now that the symmetry group G has a rotating axis,\nand therefore that A\u03c9 is G-invariant. For a fixed angular speed \u03b8, the equation\nx(t) = ei\u03b8t q(t) induces an isomorphism \u03b8\u2217 q 7\u2192 x\n\u03b8\u2217 : H 1 (R, X) \u2192 H 1 (R, X).\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\ne\nThe image \u03b8\u2217 H 1 (R, X)G can be seen as\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\ne\u2032\ne\n\u03b8\u2217 H 1 (R, X)G = H 1 (R, X)G\n\ne\u2032 (still of type R) with the property that if g is a time\nfor a new symmetry group G\ntranslation, then \u03c1(g) is trivial.

Consider the following terms. A symmetry group G is:\nbound to collision: if every G-equivariant loop has collisions;\nhomographic: if every G-equivariant loop is homographic, i.e. constant up to Euclidean similarities;\ntransitive: if the prermutation action of G on the index set is transitive;\nfully uncoercive: if for every possible rotation vector \u03c9 the corresponding action\nfunctional A\u03c9 is coercive if restricted to the space of G-equivariant loops \u039bG .\n(3.7) Definition. The kernel ker \u03c4 is termed the core of the symmetry group.\n\n4\n\nTransitive groups and transitive decomposition\n\ne \u2282 Iso(R) \u00d7\nConsider a symmetry group G \u2282 O(T) \u00d7 O(3) \u00d7 \u03a3n and its cover G\nO(3) \u00d7 \u03a3n (which anyhow is a discrete group acting on the time line R as time\u2013shifts\ne \u2192 G is a free abelian group\nand time\u2013reflections); the kernel of the projection p : G\nof rank 1.

If follows that:\ne K\ne \u2192 G/K \u2192 WO(3) K of G/K with image in\n(4.1) There is a homomorphism G/\nthe Weyl group of K in O(3).\n\nNow note that p\u22121 (ker det \u03c4 ) = ker det \u03c4\u0303 and consider the fact that the quotient\ndet ker \u03c4\u0303 /K is isomorphic to ker p \u223c\n= Z. In fact, G/K is projected onto a subgroup\ne\ne\nof O(T) \u00d7 WO(3) K, while G/K is projected onto a subgroup of Iso(R) \u00d7 WO(3) K.\n\n(4.2) Definition. Let G be a symmetry group. Then define\n(i) K = ker \u03c4 ,\n\n(ii) [r] \u2208 WO(3) K as the image in the Weyl group of the generator mod K of\nker det \u03c4 \u2282 G/K (corresponding to the time\u2013shift with minimal angle). If\nker det \u03c4 = K, then [r] = 1.\n8\n\n\f(iii) [h] \u2208 WO(3) K as the image in the Weyl group of one of the time-reflections mod\nK in G/K, in the cases such an element exists. Otherwise it is not defined.\nIn short, the triple\n(K, [r], [h])\nis said the Krh data of G.\n\n1\n\nNow assume that the action of G on the index set is transitive. Then the following\neasy results hold.\n(4.3) For all i \u2208 n, the isotropy subgroups Hi = {g \u2208 G | gi = i} are mutually\nconjugated in G. Left multiplication by elements in G yields a bijection G/H1 \u223c\n=n\nof the index set n and the set of left cosets G/H1 , which is G-equivariant (that is, a\nG-bijection).\nWe can here define the last piece of information needed for a classification of the\nsymmetry groups: let H1 denote one of the isotropy subgroups defined above in (4.3).\n(4.4) Assume that ker \u03c4 6= 1. Then one (and only one) of the following cases can\noccur:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2ker \u03c4 \u2229 H1 = 1\nker \u03c4 \u2229 H1 = hreflection along a planei\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nker \u03c4 \u2229 H1 = ker \u03c4.\n\nProof. We tacitely assumed that the core ker \u03c4 is not a reflection along a plane, since\notherwise the problem would be a planar n-body problem or bound to collisions.\nFurthermore, since we assume ker \u03c4 6= 1, the only one part is trivial. Suppose on the\nother hand that ker \u03c4 \u2229 H1 6= 1. Let E ( R3 be the linear fixed subspace\nE = R3\n\n\u0001ker \u03c4 \u2229H1\n\n.\n\nLet K be as above K = ker \u03c4 . The configuration space X can be seen as the space of\nmaps G/H1 \u2192 R3 , where G/H1 is seen as a G-set with [G : H1 ] elements and R3 is\nof course a G-space via \u03c1. The action on X (as space of maps) is the diagonal action,\nand configurations in X K correspond to K-equivariant maps G/H1 \u2192 R3 . Now,\nthe number of K-orbits in G/H1 is also the number of the double cosets K\\G/H1 ;\nsince K is normal in G, it coincides with the number of H1 -orbits in G/K, which is\n[G : H1 K]. Any K-map x : G/H1 \u2192 R3 (i.e. an element in X K ) can therefore be\ndecomposed into a sum of [G : H1 K] disjoint parts (more precisely, its domain can\nbe) which are the K-orbits in G/H1 . Each map defined on a K-orbit is conjugated\nvia an element of G to a K-map of type\nK/(K \u2229 H1 ) \u2192 (R3 )|K\u2229H1| = E,\n(thus yielding [K : K \u2229 H1 ] particles in E). The space X K is isomorphic to a direct\nsum of [G : H1 K] copies of E, over which the action of G acts via conjugation\n(actually, it is the induced/inflated module).\n1\n\nFor the sake of simplicity we omit such square brackets when unnecessary.\n\n9\n\n\fNow, consider the for hypothesis that K 6= K \u2229 H1 . The dimension dim E can\nbe 0, 1 or 2 (it cannot be 3 since by assumption K \u2229 H1 6= 1 and the action of K on\nR3 is faithful). If it is 0, then K = K \u2229 H1 (since otherwise at each time a collision\nwould occur. If dim E = 1 (and K 6= K \u2229 H1 , assumption above) then it is easy to\nshow that either the group G is fully uncoercive or it is bound to collisions: in fact\nfor one-dimensional E there cannot exist rotation axes, and any symmetry element\nyielding coercivity would make the group bound to collisions (the complementary of\nthe collision set in E is not connected). It is left the case dim E = 2, i.e. where\nK \u2229 H1 is the group generated by a single plane reflection. If the plane r fixed by\nK \u2229 H1 is K-invariant (that is, Kr = r), then K \u2229 H1 is normal in K and the\nK-representation given by \u03c1 is one of the following:\n1) Cph with p \u2265 1 (the group generated by the reflection around the plane r and p\nrotations orthogonal to r),\n2) I \u00d7 Dp with p \u2265 2 even (the Coxeter group generated by the reflection around r\nand p \"vertical\" plane reflections),\n3) Dp Cp with p \u2265 2 (the Coxeter group generated by p plane reflections) and\n4) D2p Dp with p \u2265 1 (generated by Dp and \u2212\u03b62p : it is a Coxeter group for p odd).\nCases 2), 3) and 4) do not possibly have rotation axes, and a symmetry group extending K and not coercive would be fully uncoercive. Since the bodies are constrained\nto belong to r (H1 is the isotropy of the permutation action) and the singular set\nof r cuts r into different components, a symmetry group extending such K cannot\nbe coercive without being bound to collisions. Case 1) is of a different type: the\np = [K : K \u2229 H1 ] bodies are constrained to be vertices of a regular k-agon centered at the origin and contained in r. The direction orthogonal to r is a rotation\naxis. This is the case in which the reflection along a plane yields possible periodic\norbits.\nq.e.d.\nNote that if ker \u03c4 \u2229 H1 = 1, then the isotropy H1 is isomorphic to its image under\n\u03c1 (after the composition with the projection onto the K-quotient) in the Weyl group\nWO(3) K.\n(4.5) Definition.

The blow-up of x(t) centered at 0 q\u0304 is a local\nminimizer of the Lagrangian action A restricted to the space H 1 (R, Xk )G\u2217 , where G\u2217\ne to the subgroup\nis the restriction of G\nIso\u2217 (R) \u00d7 O(3) \u00d7 \u03a3k \u2282 Iso(R) \u00d7 O(3) \u00d7 \u03a3n ,\n\nIso\u2217 (R) is the group of order 2 consisting in the isometries of R fixing 0 and \u03a3k the\npermutation group on the indices in k \u2282 n. In other words, G\u2217 is the symmetry\ngroup with Krh data (K, 1, h), the transitive decomposition obtained restricting the\npermutation action to the colliding particles in k and Xk denotes the configuration\n11\n\n\fspace of the particles in k. Another way to define G\u2217 is to consider it as the subgroup\ne (or, equivalently, G) fixing the colliding time (that is, its isotropy\nof all elements in G\nsubgroup, a maximal isotropy subgroup).\nNow it comes to the standard variation. Let us define\n\u0015\nZ \u221e\u0014\n1\n1\n\u2212\ndt\nS(s, \u03b4) =\n|t2/(2+\u03b1) s + \u03b4|\u03b1 |t2/(2+\u03b1) s|\u03b1\n0\nThe following lemma follows from section 9 of [19].\n(5.1) Let q\u0304(t) be a colliding blow-up trajectory and s\u0304 the limiting central configuration\nin Xk . If there exists a symmetric configuration \u03b4 \u2208 XkG\u2217 (that is, \u03b4 is fixed by the\nisotropy G\u2217 ) such that for every i, j \u2208 k\nS(s\u0304i \u2212 s\u0304j , \u03b4i \u2212 \u03b4j ) \u2264 0\nand for at least a pair of indices the inequality is strict, then the colliding blow-up\ntrajectory q\u0304(t) is not a minimizer.\nNow we consider three different procedures that can be used to find such a \u03b4.\nA symmetric variation \u03b4 that let the action functional A decrease on the standard\nvariation is called V-variation.\nThe following proposition is contained in the proof of theorem (10.10) of [19].\n(5.2) If G\u2217 acts trivially on k, then a V-variation always exists.\nWe recall that we say that a circle S \u2282 R3 (with center in the origin 0) is called\nH\nrotating under a group G\u2217 for an index when it is G\u2217 -invariant and S \u2282 (R3 ) i , where\nHi \u2282 G\u2217 is the isotropy of i with respect to the the permutation action of G\u2217 on the\nindex set, via \u03c3. Now, proposition (9.8) of [19] can be re-phrased as follows.\n(5.3) If there is an index i \u2208 k and a circle S \u2282 R3 which is rotating under G\u2217 for\nthe index i, then the average\nZ\nZ\nX\nS(s\u0304i \u2212 s\u0304j , \u03b4i \u2212 \u03b4j ) < 0,\n\u03b4\u2208\u03b9i S\n\n\u03b4\u2208\u03b9i S j6=i\n\nis strictly negative, where \u03b9i S \u2282 Xk is the image of the rotating circle S under the\ninclusion \u03b9i defined as the inclusions in the proof of (4.4 ). In other words, if there\nis a rotating circle under Hi then by averaging it is possible to find a V-variation.\nNote that (5.3) holds true if and only if the hypothesis of the claim is true for even\njust one of the transitive components of the index set. In other words, a V-variation\nobtained by averaging over a circle exists if and only if it is possible to obtain a Vvariation by averagin over a circle only in one of the transitive components in which\nG\u2217 can be subdivided. The same will be true for the next proposition, which is a\nnew generalization of the rotating circle property.\n(5.4) Let G\u2217 be the symmetry group of a blow up solution q\u0304 as above. If det \u03c1(G\u2217 ) = 1\n(i.e. G\u2217 acts orientation-preserving on the space R3 ) and for one of the indices\ni \u2208 k the permutation isotropy Hi (restricted to G\u2217 ) is trivial, then there exists a\nV-variation, obtained by averaging over a 2-sphere.\n12\n\n\fProof. Let S 2 \u2282 R3 be a 2-sphere centered in 0. If Hi = Hi \u2229 G\u2217 = 1, then the\nG \u2229H\nspace E = (R3 ) \u2217\ndefined as in the proof of (4.4) is equal to R3 and it contains\nthe sphere S 2 . As exaplained in the same proof, the fixed configuration space X G\u2217\ncan be decomposed into a sum of some copies of E (exactly |G\u2217 |, since the isotropy\nis trivial) and a remainder (which depends on the indices which are not in the same\nhomogeneous part of i): there is hence an embedding \u03b9i : S 2 \u2192 Xk defined by the\ngroup action. Now, all elements of G\u2217 by hypotheses act by rotations on R3 . Now\nconsider the average\nZ\nX\nA=\nS(s\u0304i \u2212 s\u0304j , \u03b4i \u2212 \u03b4j )\n\u03b4\u2208\u03b9i S 2 i<j\n\nEach term in the sum is equal to the sum of terms like\nZ\nAg =\nS(s\u0304i \u2212 s\u0304j , (1 \u2212 g)\u03b4i )\n\u03b4i \u2208S 2\n\nwhere g range in G\u2217 . But since g acts as rotation in R3 , (1 \u2212 g) is a projection onto a\nplane composed with a dilation: for each g \u2208 G\u2217 therefore there is a positive constant\ncg > 0 such that\nZ\nAg = cg\n\n\u03b4i \u2208S\n\nS(s\u0304i \u2212 s\u0304j , \u03b4i )\n\nobtained exactly as in the case of the integration of a disc. Since such terms are\nstrictly negative, the conclusion follows.\nq.e.d.\n\n6\n\nTransitive components of groups with non-colliding\nminimizers\n\n(6.1) Definition. We say that a group G has property (6.1) if it is: (i) not bound\nto collision, (ii) not fully uncoercive, (iii) not homographic and at last that (iv) for\nall maximal time-isotropy subgroups G\u2217 \u2282 G at least one of the propositions (5.2),\n(5.3) or (5.4) can be applied (that is, either G\u2217 acts trivially on indexes, or there is\na transitive component with a rotating circle or G\u2217 acts by rotations).\nIf the group is not fully uncoercive, then possibly considering a non-zero angular\nvelocity \u03c9 it is possible to show that local minima always exist. We exclude the groups\nbound to collisions and homographic simply because we are looking for collisionless\nsolutions which are not homographic. Now, if furthermore property (iv) (which\ncan be easily tested only on the transitive components, as noted above) holds, the\nexistence of a V-variation implies that all local minimizers are collisionless, which is\nour goal. We start by considering the possible cores for G (not considering at the\nmoment the permutations on the indices).\nAll finite subgroups of SO(3) listed in table 1 (and the trivial group, not listed)\nd data of the corresponding\nb in the Krh\ncan be cores by (5.4), as far as the isotropy (K\ncomponent) of one of the indices is trivial. Then, of the groups of table 2, the central\ninversion group I and the central prism/antiprysm I \u00d7 Cp group have a rotating\ncircle and can be considered. The groups I \u00d7 Dp , with p \u2265 2 are generated by plane\n13\n\n\freflections for p even and do not contain rotating circles: the action restricted to\ninvariant planes is never consisting of rotations. The only possible hypothesis for\nthe existence of a V-variation is the triviality of the permutation action: but the\nsubspace of R3 fixed is 0, and hence with more than one particle the group would\nbe bound to collisions. The remaining groups I \u00d7 T , I \u00d7 O and I \u00d7 Y of the table\nact on R3 without invariant planes (the representation is irreducible) and hence they\nmust be excluded. The same is true for the full tetrahedron group OT of table\n3. Of the three remaining groups in this table, the prism/antisprims group C2p Cp\nclearly has a rotating circle and must be added to the list. The groups Dp Cp (the\np-gonal planes reflection group) and D2p Dp (for p \u2265 2) do not have rotating circles\nand have reflections: not only none of the (5.2), (5.3) and (5.4) can be applied: all\nthe symmetry groups having this core would result to be bound to collisions or fully\nuncoercive.\n(6.2) The groups satisfying (6.1 ) are the following: 1) Cp (for p \u2265 1), 2) I \u00d7 Cp\n(for p \u2265 1), 3) C2p Cp (for p \u2265 2), 4) Dp (for p \u2265 2), 5) T , 6) O, 7) Y .\nOf course for the same reason this is also the list of projections on O(3) of the\n(possible) maximal time-isotropy groups and of the cores. The same argument yields\nthe proof of Theorem A. Now we consider the extensions (of index 2) of such cores as\npossible time-istropy for times fixed by reflections. The method used for obtaining\nthe existence of V-variations sets constraints on the type of admissible extensions:\na group with V-variations only by avaraging on spheres and without rotating circles\ncannot be extended other than in SO(3), as in the case of the last four items in the\nlist. On the other hand, the two prism/antiprysm family of groups I \u00d7 Cp and C2p Cp\nhave a rotating plane but they are not orientation-preserving: hence can be extended\nwithout restrictions on the orientation but keeping the rotating plane. Also, we need\nto rule out from the list of possible cores the groups that do not occur as cores of\nsymmetry groups not bound to collisions and not fully uncoercive. By the same\nargument used in the proof of (4.4), if R3 is disconnected by the collision subspaces,\nthen it is not possible to assume coercivity and being collisionless. Hence those\ngroups with fixed planes must be eliminated: of the two families I \u00d7 Cp and C2p Cp\n\u2032\nonly the anti-prism family of groups P2p\nsurvives, with normalizer I \u00d7 C2p (= C2ph ).\nSimple geometric and algebraic considerations lead us to the following conclusions:\n(6.3) The index 2 extensions satisfying (6.1 ) of cores satisfying (6.1 ) are the fol\u2032\nlowing: 1) C1 : I, C2 C1 , C2 . 2) Cp (for p \u2265 2): C2p , Dp , I \u00d7 Cp , C2p Cp . 3) P2p\n(for\np \u2265 1): I \u00d7 C2p , 4) Dp (for p \u2265 2): D2p . 5) T : O. 6) O: nothing. 7) Y : nothing.\n\u0012\n\u0013\nb (k, rb)\nK\nd\nRecall that the matrices of Krh and Krh data are\n(for the cyclic\nK\n[r]\n\u0012\n\u0013\nb (k, b\nK\nr) b\nh\ntype) or\n(for brake or dihedral type), as defined in (4.6).\nK\n[r] [h]\n\nTrivial core\nb = 1,\nLet us now consider the simpler case of trivial core. By definition K = 1 and K\n\u223c\ne\nwhich implies Z = G = h(1, r)i \u2282 Iso(R) \u00d7 O(3). About the pair (k, rb) generating\n14\n\n\fe 1 of the permutation isotropy, it must be a power of the generator (1, r)\nthe cover H\nand hence of the form (k, r k ).\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 (k, r k )\nIf the action is of cyclic type, then the Krh can be written as\n, where\n1\nr\nup to rotating frames r can be chosen with order at most 2 (it is not difficult to see\nthat every cyclic symmetry group is of type R). Since if r = 1, then it must be =1,\nb\nwe have for every k \u2265 1 the choreographic symmetry\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 (k, 1)\n,\n1\n1\nwhich acts transitively on the set of k bodies. Of course, the constraints can be\nwritten also as the better known form x1 (t + i) = xi (t) for i = 1, . . . , k for k-periodic\nloops.\nIf r is the reflection \u2212\u03b62 , then the Krh is\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 (k, (\u2212\u03b62 )k )\n,\n1\n\u2212\u03b62\nwhich acts again on set of k indices, but with a resulting cyclic group G with 2k\nelements. Any other choice of r would give rise to one of these groups, up to a\nchange of rotating frame.\nFollowing the same argument as in section 6 of [18], one can see that the Krh\nfor a dihedral group of type R can be chosen of the following forms (for h1 and h2\nintegers):\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 (k, 1)\n\u2217\n1 (k, (\u2212\u03b62 )k )\n\u2217\n.\nor\n1\n1\n(\u22121)h1 \u03b62h2\n1\n\u2212\u03b62\n(\u22121)h1 \u03b62 h2\nGroups not of type R can be found in an similar fashion.\n\n7\n\nA few examples\n\n(7.1) Example. Consider the icosahedral group Y of order 60. The group G with\nKrh data\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 (1, \u22121)\nY\n\u22121\n\nis isomorphic to the direct product I \u00d7 Y of order 120, and acts on the euclidean\nspace R3 as the full icosahedron group. The action on T is cyclic and given by the\nfact that ker \u03c4 = 1 \u00d7 Y . The isotropy is generated by the central inversion \u22121,\nand hence the set of bodies is G/I \u223c\n= Y . Thus at any time t the 60 point particles\nare constrained to be a Y -orbit in R3 (which does not mean they are vertices of a\nicosahedron, simply that the configuration is Y -equivariant). After half period every\nbody is in the antipodal position: xi (t + T /2) = \u2212xi (in other words, the group\ncontains the anti-symmetry, also known as Italian symmetry \u2013 see [3, 2, 10, 11]. Of\ncourse, the group Y is just an example: one can choose also the tetrahedral group\nT or the octahedral O and obtain anti-symmetric orbits for 12 (tetrahedral) or 24\n15\n\n\fFigure 1: 60-icosahedral Y , 12-tetrahedral T and 24-octahedral O periodic minimizers (chiral)\n\nFigure 2: 4-dihedral D2 and 6-dihedral D6 symmetric periodic minimizers\n(octahedral) bodies, as depicted in figure 1. The action is by its definition transitive\nand coercive; local minimizers are collisionless since the maximal T-isotropy group\nacts as a subgroup of SO(3) (i.e. orientation\u2013preserving).\n(7.2) Example. Let G be the group with Krh data\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 (1, \u22121)\n,\nDk\n\u22121\nwhere Dk is the rotation dihedral group of order 2k. As in the previous example, the\naction is such that the action functional is coercive and its local minima collisionless.\nAt every time instant the bodies are Dk -equivariant in Rk and the anti-symmetry\nholds. Approximations of minima can be seen in figure 2.\n(7.3) Example. To illustrate the case of non-transitive symmetry group, consider\nthe following (cyclic) Krh data:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 (3, \u22121)\n,\n1\n\u22121\nwhich yields a group of order 6 acting cyclically on 3 bodies, and with the antipodal\nmap on R3 . Since ker \u03c4 is trivial and the group is of cyclic type, local minima are\n16\n\n\fFigure 3: 9 and 12 bodies in anti-choreographic constraints grouped by 3\ncollisionless. Now, by adding k copies of such group one obtains a symmetry group\nhaving k copies of it as its transitive components, where still local minimizers are\ncollisionless and the restricted functional is coercive. Some possible minima can be\nfound in figure 3, for k = 3, 4.\n(7.4 ) Remark. The planar case can be dealt exactly as we did for the spatial case,\nwith a significative simplification: only when the permutation action is trivial or\nthere exists a rotating circle (that is, under these hypotheses the maximal T-isotropy\ngroup of all possible colliding times has transitive components which act on the\nposition space as rotations). A transitive decomposition of such planar symmetry\ngroup, also, is much simpler since the core has to be a (regular polygon) cyclic\ngroup. Nevertheless, also in the planar case many examples can be built using\nthese simple building block. It is still an open problem whether there are symmetry\ngroups not bound to collisions with (local or global?) minimizers which are colliding\ntrajectories. It has been proved in [7] that it cannot happen for n = 3, but to the\nauthor's knowledge there is not yet a general result.\n\nReferences\n[1] Antonio Ambrosetti.
