This indicates that the same synchronizability as the random network\n(P = 1) can be achieved with relatively small number of shortcuts. The transient behavior of the\nsynchronization, obtained from the measurement of the relaxation time, is also discussed.\nPACS numbers: 89.75.Fb, 05.45.Xt\n\nSystems of coupled nonlinear oscillators, which serve\nas prototype models for various oscillatory systems in\nnature, have attracted much attention. Those systems\nexhibit remarkable phenomena of collective synchronization, which have been observed in a variety of physical,\nbiological, and chemical systems [1]. Up to date, existing\nstudies on collective synchronization have mostly been\nperformed either on the local regular networks such as\nd-dimensional cubic lattices or on the globally connected\ngeometry. In recent years, there has been suggested the\npossibility that a number of diverse systems in nature\nmay have the same topological structure as the smallworld networks [2], which are intermediate of the local\nregular networks and the fully random networks. Such\nsmall-world networks are usually characterized by two\ninteresting features: high clustering, which is a characteristic of regular networks, and the short path length,\nwhich is typically observed in random networks [2]. Most\nstudies on small-world networks have been focused on the\ngeometrical and topological characterization of the networks, with little attention paid to dynamics defined on\nthem. Recently, some studies have considered dynamical\nsystems put on small-world networks [3,4], where such\ndesirable features as faster propagation of information,\nbetter computational power, and stronger synchronizability have been observed. In Ref. [3], frequency synchronization on the small-world network has been noticed in the presence of a small amount of randomly\nrewired connections and the possibility of the transition to global entrainment with the mean-field nature\nhas been pointed out. However, quantitative analysis\nhas not been performed and proper understanding is still\nlacking. For example, the critical rewiring probability\nbeyond which true long-range order is present at finite\ncoupling strength has not been addressed.\n\nvaried.\nIn general, frequency synchronization can\nbe attained without synchronization of phases, and\nwe explore both to investigate the synchronizationdesynchronization transition. Via careful finite-size scaling, we find the following: (i) Phase synchronization as\nwell as frequency one, which is absent in one-dimensional\nregular networks, emerges in the presence of even a very\nsmall fraction of shortcuts. (ii) The phase synchronization transition is of the mean-field type, the same as the\nKuramoto model [5]. (iii) The relaxation time monotonically decreases with the rewiring probability P up\nto P = 0.5 and apparently saturates for P >\n\u223c 0.5. This\nindicates that the time required to synchronize the smallworld network for P >\n\u223c 0.5 is almost the same as that for\na random network (P = 1).\nAccording to Ref. [2], the small-world network is constructed in the following way: First, a one-dimensional\nregular network with only local connections (of range k)\nbetween the N nodes is constructed. Each local link is\nvisited once, and then with the rewiring probability P it\nis removed and reconnected to a randomly chosen node.\nAfter the whole sweep of the entire network, the total\nnumber of shortcuts in the network is given by N P k for\nsufficiently large N . At each node of this small-world\nnetwork is located an oscillator; a link connecting two\nnodes represents coupling between the two oscillators at\nthose two nodes. Describing the state of the ith oscillator, i.e., the one at node i by its phase \u03c6i , we write the\nset of equations of motion governing the dynamics of the\nN oscillator system (i = 1, 2, * * * , N ) [5]:\n\u03c6\u0307i (t) +\n\nK X\nsin(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j ) = \u03c9i ,\n2k\n\n(1)\n\nj\u2208\u039bi\n\nwhere \u039bi denotes the set of nodes connected to node i\n(via either local links or shortcuts) and K is the coupling\nstrength suitably normalized with respect to the average\nnumber of connections per node. On the right-hand side\n\u03c9i represents the intrinsic frequency of the ith oscillator.\n\nIn this paper we study the detailed aspects of the\ncollective synchronizations on small-world networks, as\nthe rewiring probability and the coupling strength are\n1\n\n\fThey are quenched random variables with the distribution function g(\u03c9).\nOn the small-world network built in this manner with\ngiven k and P , we investigate the collective synchronization behavior of the coupled oscillators at various values\nof the coupling strength K. For convenience, the range\nk = 3 is taken and the Gaussian distribution with unit\nvariance (\u03c3 2 = 1) for g(\u03c9) is used [6]. We then use the\nHeun's method [7] with the discrete time step \u2206t = 0.05,\nto integrate numerically Eq. (1). Typically, while the\nequations of motion are integrated for Nt = 4 \u00d7 103\ntime steps, the data from the first Nt /2 steps are discarded in measuring quantities of interest. Both \u2206t and\nNt have been varied to verify that the measured quantities are precise enough and the networks of various sizes,\nup to N = 3200, have been considered. For each network\nsize, we have performed one hundred independent runs\nwith different configurations of the intrinsic frequencies\nas well as different network realizations, over which averages have been taken.\nCollective behavior of the oscillator system is conveniently described by the order parameters\n\uf8ee*\n+\uf8f9\nN\nX\n1\nei\u03c6j \uf8fb ,\n(2)\nm\u2261\uf8f0\nN j=1\n\uf8ee*\n+\uf8f9\nN\nX\n2\n2\ne\u2212c(\u03c6\u0307i \u2212\u03c6\u0307j ) \uf8fb ,\n(3)\nq\u2261\uf8f0\nN (N \u2212 1) i<j\n\nexhibits strong dependence on the rewiring probability\nP . In particular, both of them do not show synchronization in the absence of shortcuts (P = 0), which is\nconsistent with the known result in a one-dimensional\nsystem [8]. When a tiny fraction of the shortcuts comes\ninto the system, on the other hand, the dynamics of the\nsystem changes dramatically, giving rise to phase and frequency synchronization (compare curves for P = 0 and\nfor P = 0.05 in Fig. 1 and 2). Another interesting feature\nfound in Fig. 1 is that as P grows, phase synchronization,\nmeasured by m(K) in Fig. 1, saturates and does not show\nsignificant difference for P > Pm \u2248 0.5. It is thus indicated that phase synchronization almost the same as that\nfor P = 1.0 can be achieved with relatively small amount\nof shortcuts (P \u2248 0.5). This may have some practical importance in network systems where making long-ranged\nshortcuts has a high cost of resources. \u00bfFrom an economical point of view, small-world networks with P \u2248 Pm is\nfavorable: Global coherence is attained with resources\nspent as less as possible. Similar behavior may also be\nexpected for the frequency synchronization measured by\nq(K) in Fig. 2, although rather large finite-size effects,\nparticularly for small P , tend to obscure such saturation\nbehavior of q.\nFor comparison, the synchronization behavior in the\nglobally-connected network is also displayed in Figs. 1\nand 2, where good agreement with the analytic expression m \u2248 1 \u2212 \u03c3 2 /2K 2 found in Ref. [10] for large K is\nshown (see the thick solid line labeled by \"AN\" in Fig. 1).\nNoting that the number of connections in a small-world\nnetwork is O(N ), in sharp contrast with O(N 2 ) valid in\nthe globally-connected network, we naturally expect that\nthe phase synchronization on a small-world network sets\nin at the coupling strength larger than the critical value\nKc = 2/\u03c0g(0) \u2248 1.60 in a globally-connected network\n[for the Gaussian distribution g(\u03c9) with unit variance] [5].\nIndeed such features are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that qualitatively the same synchronization behavior is observed for the globally-coupled\nnetwork and the small-world network, which implies that\nstrong synchronization can be achieved with only O(N )\nconnections instead of O(N 2 ).\nPrecise determination of the critical coupling strength\nKc separating desynchronized and synchronized states\nrequires careful consideration of the finite-size effects. We\nexamine finite-size scaling of the phase order parameter\nto determine Kc and explore the transition nature around\nit. In the thermodynamic limit the order parameter displays the critical behavior\n\nwhere h* * *i and [* * *] denote the averages over time and\nover different realizations of the intrinsic frequencies, respectively, and c is a sufficiently large number. Since the\nfrequency resolution is given by (Nt \u2206t)\u22121 in numerical\nsimulations, two oscillators should be regarded as mutually entrained if the difference in frequency is smaller\nthan (Nt \u2206t)\u22121 . The order parameter q in Eq. (3) does\nnot depend sensitively on the value of c, and we thus\nchoose c = 106 , which turns out to be sufficient for perceiving the difference. For comparison, we have also considered a different version of the frequency order parameter r \u2261 limN \u2192\u221e (Ns /N ), where Ns is the number of\nmutually entrained oscillators in the largest cluster [8],\nonly to find no essential difference.\nFigures 1 and 2 display the obtained phase and frequency order parameters (m and q) versus the coupling\nstrength K at various values of the rewiring probability.\nIn the weak coupling limit (K \u2192 0), phases of the oscillators are distributed\n\u221a uniformly on the interval [0, 2\u03c0],\nyielding m = O(1/ N ) and the absence of macroscopic\ncoherence. On the other hand, in the strong coupling\nlimit (K \u2192 \u221e) all phases of the oscillators become synchronized, to give m = 1 and accordingly q = 1, regardless of the detailed structure of the network [9].\nAn important observation from Figs. 1 and 2 is that\nsynchronization of the phase as well as of the frequency\n\nm \u223c (K \u2212 Kc )\u03b2 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwith the critical exponent \u03b2. On the other hand, in a\nfinite system, we expect m = (K \u2212 Kc )\u03b2 f (\u03be/N, \u03b6/N )\nwith a function f of two scaling arguments \u03be/N and\n\u03b6/N , where the correlation length \u03be diverges at Kc , and\n2\n\n\fhave been obtained from the finite-size scaling analysis described above. The nature of the synchronization\ntransition has always been found to be the mean-field\ntype for all values of P used in this work. We find\nthat the phase boundary in Fig. 5 is well described by\nthe equation Kc = 1.64(4) + 0.28(1)P \u22121 . As P \u2192 \u221e,\nthis form predicts Kc = 1.64(4), in good agreement with\nKc \u2248 1.61 found in Fig. 3 and the known analytic result\nKc = 2/\u03c0g(0) \u2248 1.60 for the globally-coupled network.\nThis agreement is somehow expected since the globallycoupled network, where the number of long-ranged connections (shortcuts) is O(N 2 ), corresponds to P \u2248 N .\nStraightforward extrapolation of the estimated form of\nthe phase boundary predicts that Kc is finite only if\nP 6= 0. Assuming its validity, one expects to have synchronization on the small-world network at finite coupling strength unless P is zero. This has close resemblance to the existing studies on the small-world phenomena: The characteristic path-length in the smallworld network behaves very differently for P = 0 and\nfor P 6= 0 [14]. Thus supported is the view that the\nsmall-world transition and the order-disorder transition\nare intimately related [15].\nMeanwhile, the frequency order parameter q is observed to shift toward larger values of the coupling\nstrength K with the increase of the system size N , sustaining its shape and eventually converging. Such peculiar behavior, which appears more conspicuous at small\nvalues of P , makes the standard finite-size scaling analysis inadequate, leaving the precise value of the critical coupling strength for the frequency synchronization\nrather difficult to determine. In particular it is not clear\nwhether phase synchronization and frequency synchronization emerge simultaneously (at the same critical coupling strength) for all values of the rewiring probability\nP . The rather limited data appear to favor a slightly\nsmaller value of the critical coupling strength for frequency synchronization (at small values of P ), suggesting\nthe interesting possibility of frequency synchronization\nwithout phase synchronization for intermediate values of\nthe coupling K. For conclusive results, however, more\nextensive simulations are required.\n\u00bfFrom the point of view of information transfer, the\nremarkably short path length observed in a small-world\nnetwork may imply that information flow through all elements in the network is quite fast. In the present work,\nthis can be rephrased as follows: The time it takes to establish global synchronization should decrease substantially as small amounts of shortcuts are introduced. To\ninvestigate such transient behavior, we start from random initial conditions and measure the phase order parameter m as a function of time. The average relaxation\ntime [16]\n\n\u03b6 (\u2261 1/kP ) is an additional length scale corresponding to\nthe typical distance between the ends of shortcuts in the\nsmall-world network [11]. Here we pay attention to the\nsystem with size much larger than \u03b6, and approximate the\nabove scaling function f (\u03be/N, \u03b6/N ) as f (\u03be/N, 0). This\nleads to the scaling form of the order parameter\n\u0010\n\u0011\nm = N \u2212\u03b2/\u03bd\u0304 F (K \u2212 Kc )N 1/\u03bd\u0304 ,\n(5)\n\nwhere the critical exponent \u03bd\u0304 describes the divergence of\nthe correlation volume \u03beV at Kc [12,13]:\n\u03beV \u223c |K \u2212 Kc |\u2212\u03bd\u0304 .\n\n(6)\n\nSince at K = Kc the function F in Eq. (5) has a value\nindependent of N , one can determine Kc by means of\nthe standard finite-size scaling analysis. Namely, plotting mN \u03b2/\u03bd\u0304 versus K for various sizes, one can find the\nvalue of \u03b2/\u03bd\u0304 which gives a well-defined crossing point at\nKc . After \u03b2/\u03bd\u0304 and Kc are determined, one then use\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\u2212\u03b2\ndm\n=\nln N + const,\n(7)\nln\ndK Kc\n\u03bd\u0304\nin order to obtain the value of (1\u2212\u03b2)/\u03bd\u0304, which, combined\nwith the known value of \u03b2/\u03bd\u0304, gives the values of \u03b2 and\n\u03bd\u0304.\nFigure 3 shows the determination of Kc for the\nglobally-connected network through the use of the finitesize scaling form in Eq. (5). Varying the value of \u03b2/\u03bd\u0304,\nwe find that \u03b2/\u03bd\u0304 \u2248 0.25 gives the well-defined crossing point at Kc \u2248 1.61, which is in a good agreement\nwith the analytical result Kc = 2/\u03c0g(0) \u2248 1.60 [5]. In\nthe inset of Fig. 3, the least-square fit to Eq. (7) gives\n(1 \u2212 \u03b2)/\u03bd\u0304 \u2248 0.27, which, combined with \u03b2/\u03bd\u0304 \u2248 0.25,\nyields \u03b2 \u2248 0.48 and \u03bd\u0304 \u2248 1.92. These results are certainly\nconsistent with the fact that the globally-connected network is a mean-field system, which has \u03b2 = 1/2 and\n\u03bd = 1/2 [5]; in particular the obtained value of \u03bd\u0304 close to\n2 indicates that the upper critical dimension of the synchronization transition is four [12]. Similarly, the transition behavior on the small-world network may be investigated. Shown in Fig. 4 is the determination of exponents and Kc for the small-world network with the\nrewiring probability P = 0.2. From the same analysis\nas in Fig. 3, we obtain Kc \u2248 2.88 together with exponents \u03b2 \u2248 0.51 and \u03bd\u0304 \u2248 2.04, which are essentially the\nsame as those in the globally-coupled network. This concludes that the coupled oscillator system on a small-world\nnetwork with the number of connections given by O(N )\ndisplays a mean-field synchronization transition, like the\nsystem on a globally connected network with the much\nlarger number of connections O(N 2 ).\nFigure 5 displays the phase diagram on the plane of\nK and P .

The average relaxation time defined in\nthis way is very useful for the systems with many relaxation time scales. Here, for P > 0, we observe that m\u0304(t)\nat long times does not fit well to the exponential decay\nform based on a single relaxation time scale. In Fig. 6 we\nshow the relaxation time \u03c4m versus P at K = 10. As P\nis increased, \u03c4m is shown to decrease up to P \u2248 0.5, and\nthen it appears to saturate for P >\n\u223c 0.5. The similarity\nbetween the phase boundary in Fig. 5 and the relaxation\ntime in Fig. 6 is striking and suggests almost the same\nsynchronization behavior (in both transient and stationary aspects) for all values of P >\n\u223c 0.5. We have also investigated the relaxation time \u03c4q for frequency synchronization and found that similar saturation appears, as shown\nin the inset of Fig. 6. This reflects the overall similarity\nin achieving both types of synchronization.\nIn summary, we have examined collective synchronization in the system of coupled oscillators on small-world\nnetworks. Both the phase and frequency synchronization have been found to exhibit strong dependence on\nthe rewiring probability P , as P is raised from zero. In\nparticular, for any nonzero value of P considered here,\nboth types of synchronization emerge at finite coupling\nstrengths while they are absent at P = 0. This apparently suggests that the critical value of P , below which\nsynchronization does not set in at any finite coupling\nstrength, vanishes, although more extensive simulations\nnear P = 0 are necessary for conclusive results. The\nphase boundary for the (phase) synchronization transition, which is of the mean-field type at any P , has been\nobtained from the finite-size scaling analysis of the phase\norder parameter. The transient behavior of synchronization has also been investigated through the relaxation\ntime of the system, i.e., the time taken by the system\nin the desynchronized initial state to reach the final synchronized state. Both the phase diagram and the relaxation time, measuring the stationary and transient features of synchronization, respectively, display similar saturation behavior for P >\n\u223c 0.5. \u00bfFrom a practical point of\nview, this saturation behavior has a useful implication\non building networks: Since the long-range connection\nusually costs more than the local connection, it is advantageous to tune P to the value at which the saturation\nbegins and to establish globally connected behavior with\nless consumption of resources. Finally, the possibility of\nsuccessive transitions with the coupling strength, one for\nfrequency synchronization and the other for phase synchronization, has been raised at small values of P , the\ndetailed investigation of which is left for future study.\n\n[1] For a list of references, see A.T.
