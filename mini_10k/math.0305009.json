Both G(D) and\nS(D) are naturally embedded in the Hilbert space H = L2 (D, Rd ) of all square\nintegrable mapping from D into Rd and, therefore, inherit from H a formal Riemannian structure. The equations of geodesics on G(D) turn out to be exactly [AK]\nthe equations of incompressible inviscid fluids introduced by Euler near 1750 [Eu].\nThe Euler equations play a fundamental role in Fluid Mechanics (for geophysical\nflow modelling in particular) and their global well-posedness is one of the most challenging problems in the field of nonlinear PDEs. Their mathematical importance\nis confirmed by the recent publication of several books by Arnold-Khesin [AK],\nChemin [Ch], P.-L. Lions [Li], Marchioro-Pulvirenti [MP], as well as by Majda's\nlecture in the Kyoto ICM [Ma].\nFrom a geometric point of view (different from the usual PDE setting which\nconsists in solving the Euler equations with prescribed initial conditions), it is natural to look for minimizing geodesics between the identity map and prescribed\nmeasure preserving maps. More precisely :\nDefinition 1.1 Given h \u2208 G(D), find a curve t \u2208 [0, 1] \u2192 g(t) \u2208 G(D) satisfying\ng(0) = I, g(1) = h, that minimizes\nZ\nZ Z\n1 1\n1 1 \u2032\n||g (t)||2L2 dt =\n|\u2202t g(t, x)|2 dxdt.\nAD (g) =\n2 0\n2 0 D\n2\nThe infimum is nothing but 12 \u03b4D\n(I, h), where \u03b4D denotes the geodesic distance\non G(D), and any smooth minimizer g must be a smooth solution of the Euler\nequations (written in \"Lagrangian coordinates\")\n\ng \u2032\u2032 \u25e6 g \u22121 = \u2212\u2207p,\nwhere p = p(t, x) \u2208 R is the pressure field and \u2207p = (\u2202x1 p, ..., \u2202xd p). The minimization problem will be subsequently called \"Shortest Path Problem\" (SPP).\nThe basic local existence and uniqueness theorem for the SPP is due to Ebin and\nMarsden [EM]. If h and I are sufficiently close in a sufficiently high order Sobolev\nnorm, then there is a unique shortest path. In the large, uniqueness can fail for the\nSPP. For example, in the case when D is the unit disk, h(z) = \u2212z, the SPP has two\nsolutions g(t, z) = ze+i\u03c0t and g(t, z) = ze\u2212i\u03c0t , where complex notations are used.\nIn 1985, A. Shnirelman [Sh] found, in the case D = [0, 1]3 , a class of data for which\nthe SPP cannot have a (classical) solution. These data are those of form\nh(x1 , x2 , x3 ) = (H(x1 , x2 ), x3 ),\nwhere H is an area preserving mapping of the unit square, i.e. an element of\nG([0, 1]2 ), for which\n\u03b4[0,1]3 (I, h) < \u03b4[0,1]2 (I, H) < +\u221e.\n(This means that, although h is really a two dimensional map, genuinely 3D motions perform better to reach h from I than purely 2D motions.)\nShnirelman also proved [Sh], [Sh2], that S([0, 1]d ) is the right completion of G([0, 1]d )\nfor the geodesic distance \u03b4, for all dimension d \u2265 3. (Notice that S([0, 1]d ) is the\n\n\fSome Geometric PDEs Related to Hydrodynamics and Electrodynamics\n\n763\n\nL2 completion of G([0, 1]d ) for all d \u2265 2 [Ne]. So, the case d = 2 is very peculiar.)\nIn such situations, a complete existence and uniqueness result for the SPP was obtained in [Br2], provided the pressure field is considered as the right unknown and\nnot the path t \u2192 g(t) itself.\nTheorem 1.2 Let h \u2208 S([0, 1]3 ) of form h(x1 , x2 , x3 ) = (H(x1 , x2 ), x3 ) with H \u2208\nS([0, 1]2 ). Then there is a unique vector-valued measure \u2207p(t, x1 , x2 ) such that,\nfor each sequence of curves t \u2208 [0, 1] \u2192 gn (t) \u2208 G([0, 1]3 ) labelled by n \u2208 N and\nsatisfying\n1 2\nA[0,1]3 (gn ) \u2192 \u03b4[0,1]\n||gn (1) \u2212 h||L2 ([0,1]3 \u2192 0,\n3 (I, h),\n2\nas n \u2192 \u221e, then (in the distributional sense)\ngn\u2032\u2032 \u25e6 gn\u22121 \u2192 \u2212\u2207p.\nIn other words, the acceleration field of all minimizing sequences converge to \u2212\u2207p\nwhich uniquely depends on data h. The proof relies on an appropriate concept of\ngeneralized solutions (related to \"Young's measures\" [Yo], [Ta], [DM], [She]) that\ndescribe the oscillatory behaviour of the (gn ) as n \u2192 +\u221e and reduces the SPP to\na convex minimization problem. (See [Br2] for more details.) More precisely, the\nassociated measures\ncn (t, x, a) = \u03b4(x \u2212 gn (t, a)),\n\nmn (t, x, a) = \u2202t gn (t, a)\u03b4(x \u2212 gn (t, a)),\n\nhave cluster points (c, m) that have the following properties :\n1) m is absolutely continuous with respect to c and its vector-valued density v(t, x, a)\nis c\u2212 square integrable;\n2) c and v do not depend on x3 and v3 = 0,\n3) c and v solve\n\u2202t c + \u2207x .(cv) = 0, \u2202t (cv) + \u2207x .(cv \u2297 v) + c\u2207x p = 0,\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere the product c\u2207x p has to be properly defined (in a way related to the work of\nZheng and Majda [ZM]). Equations (1.1) are obtained as the optimality equations\nof the convexified minimization problem. Therefore, it is a priori unclear they have\nany physical meaning as evolution equations. However, they correspond, up to a\nchange of unknown, to the hydrostatic limit of the Euler equations, obtained from\nthe Euler equations by neglecting the vertical acceleration term, namely:\nKg \u2032\u2032 \u25e6 g \u22121 = \u2212\u2207p,\nwhere K is the singular diagonal matrix (1, 1, 0). These hydrostatic (or \"shear\nflow\") equations are widely used for atmosphere and ocean circulation modelling,\nas the building block of the so-called \"primitive equations\". However, they are\nmore singular than the Euler equations and their mathematical analysis is very\nlimited, as discussed in [Li]. Conditional well posedness and derivation from the\nEuler equations have been established in [Br3] and [Gr].\n\n\f764\n\nYann Brenier\n\nRemarks\nAn intriguing question is whether or not the uniqueness of \u2207p can be proved\nby more classical tools even in the case when H \u2208 G([0, 1]2 ) can be connected to\nthe identity map by a classical shortest path on G([0, 1]2 ).\nSince S([0, 1]3 ) is the right completion of G([0, 1]3 ) with respect to the geodesic\ndistance, one could expect the SP P to have a solution in S([0, 1]3 ) for all data h.\nThis is not true. An example of such a data is h(x1 , x2 , x3 ) = (1 \u2212 x1 , x2 , x3 ). Only\ngeneralized flows, as discussed in [Br2], can describe shortest paths in full generality.\n\nExample of generalized solutions\nExplicit examples of non trivial generalized shortest paths can be computed\neither numerically or exactly. Let us just quote a typical example, when D is the\ncylinder {(z, s) = (x1 , x2 , s), |z| \u2264 1, 0 \u2264 s \u2264 1} and h(z, s) = (\u2212z, s). Then,\nthe classical SPP has two distinct solutions g+ (t, z, s) = (ei\u03c0t z, s) and g\u2212 (t, z, s) =\n(e\u2212i\u03c0t z, s), with the same pressure field p = \u03c0 2 |z|2 /2, where complex notations are\nused on the disk |z| \u2264 1. (Notice that there is no motion along the vertical axis s.)\nTrivial generalized solutions are obtained by mixing these two solutions. However, a\nnon trivial generalized solution exists and can be described as follows. For each fluid\nparticle initially located at (z, s), the elevation s stays unchanged and the initial\nhorizontal position z splits up along a circle of radius (1 \u2212 |z|2 )1/2 sin(\u03c0t), with\ncenter z cos(\u03c0t), that moves across the unit disk and shrinks down to the point \u2212z\nas t = 1. In addition, each particle is accelerated by the pressure field p = \u03c0 2 |z|2 /2,\nas expected from the theory.\n\n2.\n\nPolar factorization of maps and the MongeAmp\u00e8re equation\n\nA way to define approximate geodesics on G = G(D) is to introduce a penalty\nparameter \u01eb > 0 and to consider the formal (hamiltonian) dynamical system in the\nHilbert space H = L2 (D, Rd )\n\u03b4\nd2\n\u01eb 2M +\ndt\n\u03b4M\n2\n\n\u0012\n\nd2H (M, G)\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n= 0,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere the unknown M is a curve t \u2192 M (t) \u2208 H, \u03b4/\u03b4M denotes the gradient\noperator in H, and\ndH (M, G) = inf ||M \u2212 g||H\n(2.2)\ng\u2208G\n\nis the distance in H between M and G, where ||.||H is the Hilbert norm of H. This\napproach is related to Ebin's slightly compressible flow theory [Eb], and is a natural\nextension of the theory of constrained finite dimensional mechanical systems [RU],\n[AK]. Notice that the approximate geodesic equation is sensitive only to the L2\nclosure of G(D), which is, in the case D = [0, 1]d , d \u2265 2, the entire semi-group S(D)\n[Ne]. As the penalty parameter \u01eb goes to zero, we expect that for appropriate initial\n\n\fSome Geometric PDEs Related to Hydrodynamics and Electrodynamics\n\n765\n\ndata, typically for M (t = 0) = I and (d/dt)M (t = 0) = v0 , where v0 is a smooth\ndivergence free vector field on D tangent to the boundary, the time dependent map\nM converges to a geodesic curve on G. Because of the classical properties of the\ndistance function in a Hilbert space, for each point M \u2208 H for which there exists a\nunique closest point \u03c0S (M ) on S(D), we have\n\u03b4 d2H (M, G)\n(\n) = M \u2212 \u03c0S (M ).\n\u03b4M\n2\n\n(2.3)\n\nThus, we can formally write the approximate geodesic equation (2.1)\n\u01eb2\n\nd2\nM + M \u2212 \u03c0S (M ) = 0.\ndt2\n\n(2.4)\n\nTherefore, it is natural to address the following variational problem, that we call\nthe Closest Point Problem (CPP)\nDefinition 2.1 Given M \u2208 L2 (D, Rd ), find h \u2208 S(D) that minimizes\nZ\n1\n|M (x) \u2212 h(x)|2 dx.\n2 D\nThe solution of the CPP is given by the Polar Factorization theorem for maps\n[Br1]\nTheorem 2.2 Let M : D \u2192 Rd be an L2 map such that the probability measure\nZ\n\u03b4(x \u2212 M (a))da\n\u03c1M (x) =\nD\n\nis a Lebesgue integrable function on D. Then, there exists a unique closest point\n\u03c0S (M ) on S(D) and there is a Lipschitz convex function \u03a6 on Rd such that\n\u03c0S (M )(a) = (\u2207\u03a6)(M (a)), a.e. a \u2208 D.\nIn addition, \u03a6 is a weak solution, in a suitable sense, of the Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation\ndet(\u2202xx \u03a6(x)) = \u03c1M (x).\nThus, the Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation [Ca], which is usually considered as a non\nvariational geometric PDE related to the concept of Gaussian curvature, also is the\noptimality equation of a variational problem closely linked to the Euler equations\nof incompressible inviscid fluids. In addition, the Polar Factorization theorem can\nbe seen as a nonlinear version of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition theorem for\nvector fields which asserts that any L2 vector field on D can be written in a unique\nway as the (orthogonal) sum of the gradient of a scalar field and a divergence\nfree field tangent to \u2202D. Shortly after [Br1], Caffarelli [Ca] established several\nregularity results for the Polar Factorization. For example, provided D is smooth\nand strictly convex, any smooth orientation preserving diffeomorphism M of D has\na unique Polar Factorization with smooth factors, and \u03c0S (M ) belongs to G(D).\nMore recently, McCann [Mc] generalized the Polar Factorization theorem when D\nis a compact Riemannian manifolds.\n\n\f766\n\n3.\n\nYann Brenier\n\nOptimal Transportation Theory\n\nIn [Br1], the solution of the CPP problem is based on the Optimal Transportation Theory (OTT). The OTT was introduced by Monge in 1781 [Mo] to solve an\nengineering problem and renewed by Kantorovich near 1940 [Ka] in the framework\nof Linear Programing and Probability Theory [RR]. In modern words, this amounts\nto look for a probability measure \u03bc on a given product measure space A \u00d7 B, with\nprescribed projections on A and B, that minimizes\nZ\n\nc(x, y)d\u03bc(x, y),\n\nA\u00d7B\n\nwhere the \"cost function\" c \u2265 0 is given on A \u00d7 B. The CPP roughly corresponds\nto the case when A = B = D, c(x, y) = |M (x) \u2212 y|2 and each projection of \u03bc is the\n(normalized) Lebesgue measure on D. The connexion established in [Br1] between\nthe OTT and the Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation, enhanced by Caffarelli's regularity theory [Ca], introduced OTT as an active field of research in nonlinear PDEs. Let us\nfirst quote the work of Evans-Gangbo [Ev] to solve the original Monge problem with\nPDE techniques, related to the Eikonal equations, and the recent contributions of\nAmbrosio, Caffarelli, Feldman, McCann, Trudinger, Wang. (A first attempt was\nmade by Sudakov [Su] with purely probabilistic tools.) Let us next point out the\nimportance of OTT for modelling purposes in Applied Mathematics. First of all,\nit is fair to say that the OTT and the Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation were already key\ningredients in Cullen and Purser's theory of semi-geostrophic atmospheric flows,\nwhich goes back to the early 1980s and preceded our Polar Factorization theorem\n(see references in [CNP]). Next, Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto [JKO], using OTT, established that the heat equation can be seen as a gradient flow for Boltzmann's\nentropy functional. More systematically, Otto [Ot] showed how the OTT confers\na natural Riemannian structure to sets of Probability measures and recognized a\nlarge class of dissipative PDEs as gradient flows of various functionals for such\nRiemannian structures. Examples of such PDEs are porous media equations, lubrication equations, granular flow equations, etc... Let us also mention that OTT\nhas became a powerful tool in Calculus of Variations (through McCann's concept of\ndisplacement convexity [Mc]) and Functional Analysis, where all kind of functional\ninequalities (Minkowski, Brascamp-Lieb, Log Sobolev, Bacry-Emery, etc,...) can\nbe established through OTT arguments, as shown, in particular, by Barthe [Ba],\nMcCann [Mc], Otto, Villani [OV]. Let us finally mention that [BB] has provided\nfor the OTT a formulation different from the Monge-Kantorovich one, by introducing an interpolation variable (which was already present in McCann's concept of\ndisplacement convexity). This point of view is useful for both numerical [BB] and\ntheoretical purposes, in particular, by allowing non trivial generalizations of the\nOTT related to section 6.\n\n4.\n\nApproximate geodesics and Electrodynamics\n\n\fSome Geometric PDEs Related to Hydrodynamics and Electrodynamics\n\n767\n\nLet us go back to the approximate geodesic equation (2.4) that can be (formally) written, thanks to the Polar Factorization theorem,\n\u2202tt M (t, a) + (\u2207\u03c6)(t, M (t, a)) = 0, det(I \u2212 \u01eb2 \u2202xx \u03c6(t, x)) = \u03c1M (t, x)\n\n(4.1)\n\n(where \u03c6(t, x) stands for \u01eb\u22122 (|x|2 /2 \u2212 \u03a6(t, x))). A formal expansion about \u01eb = 0\nleads, as expected, to the Euler equation (written in Lagrangian coordinates) at the\nzero order and, at the next order (and exactly as d = 1), to\n\u2202tt M (t, a) + (\u2207\u03c6)(t, M (t, a)) = 0, \u01eb2 \u2206\u03c6(t, x) = 1 \u2212 \u03c1M (t, x),\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhich can be equivalently written as\n\u2202t f + \u03be.\u2207x f \u2212 \u2207x \u03c6.\u2207\u03be f = 0, \u01eb2 \u2206\u03c6 = 1 \u2212\n\nZ\n\nf d\u03be\n\n(4.3)\n\nby introducing the \"phase density\"\nZ\n\u03b4(x \u2212 M (t, a))\u03b4(\u03be \u2212 \u2202t M (t, a))da.\nf (t, x, \u03be) =\nD\n\nThis system is nothing but the Vlasov-Poisson system that describes the classical\nnon-relativistic motion of a continuum of electrons around a homogeneous neutralizing background of ions through Coulomb interactions.\nSo, the approximate geodesic equation, which can be written as a \"VlasovMonge-Amp\u00e8re\" (VMA) system,\nZ\n2\n\u2202t f + \u03be.\u2207x f \u2212 \u2207x \u03c6.\u2207\u03be f = 0, det(I \u2212 \u01eb \u2202xx \u03c6) = f d\u03be\n(4.4)\ncan be interpreted as a (fully nonlinear) correction of the Vlasov-Poisson system\nfor small values of \u01eb. Recently, Loeper [Lo] has shown that the VMA system has\nlocal smooth solutions and global weak solutions. Loeper has also proved that the\nEuler equations and the Vlasov-Poisson system correctly describe the asymptotic\nbehaviour of the VMA system as \u01eb \u2192 0. The asymptotic analysis is based on\nthe so-called modulated energy method already used in [Br5] to derive the Euler\nequations from the Vlasov-Poisson system.\nNotice that, thanks to the substitution of the Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation (a\nfully non-linear elliptic PDE) for the classical Poisson equation, the \"electric\" field\n\u2207\u03c6(t, x) is pointwise bounded by the diameter of D divided by \u01eb2 , independently\non the initial conditions. In particular, point charges do not create unbounded force\nfields as in classical Electrodynamics.\n\n5.\n\nA caricature of Coulomb interaction\n\nThe approximate geodesic equation (2.4) can be easily discretized in space\nby substituting i) for D a discrete set of N \"grid\" points equally spaced in D,\nsay A1 , ..., AN , ii) for H the euclidean space RdN , iii) for G the discrete set of all\n\n\f768\n\nYann Brenier\n\nsequences (A\u03c31 , ..., A\u03c3N ) \u2208 RdN generated by permutations \u03c3 of the first N integers, while keeping unchanged equation (2.4). (Note that such a discretization\nusing permutations cannot be so easily defined for the Euler equations, which formally correspond to the limit case \u01eb = 0.) Then M (t) = (M1 (t), ..., MN (t)) can be\ninterpreted as a set of N harmonic oscillators\n\u01eb2\n\nd2\nM\u03b1 + M\u03b1 \u2212 A\u03c3\u03b1 (t) = 0,\ndt2\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere the time dependent permutation \u03c3(t) is subject to minimize, at all time t,\nthe total potential energy\nN\nX\n(5.2)\n|M\u03b1 (t) \u2212 A\u03c3\u03b1 |2 .\n\u03b1=1\n\nThis system can be seen as a collection of N springs linking each particle M\u03b1 to one\nof the fixed particle A\u03b2 according to a dynamical pairing \u03b2 = \u03c3\u03b1 (t) maintaining the\nbulk potential energy at the lowest level. There is some ambiguity in the definition\nof this formal hamiltonian system for which the hamiltonian is given by\nN\nN\n1 X\n1 X dM\u03b1 2\n| + inf 2\n|\n|M\u03b1 \u2212 A\u03c3\u03b1 |2 .\n\u03c3 2\u01eb\n2 \u03b1=1 dt\n\u03b1=1\n\n(5.3)\n\nIn particular, \u03c3(t) is not uniquely defined at each time t for which several particles have the same position. However, the potential is the sum of a quadratic\nand a Lipschitz concave functions of M . So its gradient has linear growth at infinity and its second order partial derivatives are locally bounded measures. This\nis enough, according to recent results by Lions and Bouchut [Bo], [Li2], to ensure\nthat unique global solutions are well defined for Lebesgue almost every initial data\nd\nM\u03b1 (0), \u03b1 = 1, ..., N . As expected, the limit N \u2192 +\u221e, \u01eb \u2192 0 (provided\nM\u03b1 (0), dt\nN goes fast enough to +\u221e), leads to the Euler equation, as proven in [Br4]. From\nthe electrostatic point of view, the dynamical system describes a nonlinearly cutoff\nCoulomb interaction between N electrons (with positions M\u03b1 ) and a background\nof N motionless ions (with fixed positions A\u03b1 ).\n\n6.\n\nGeneralized extremal surface equations and\nElectrodynamics\n\nAs seen above, the approximate geodesic equation (4.1)-which has been introduced as a natural geometrical approximation to the Euler equations-turns out\nto be a model for electrostatic interaction with a non-linearly cutoff Coulomb potential. This feature is somewhat reminiscent of the Born-Infeld non-linear theory of\nthe electromagnetic field [BI] (see also [BDLL], [GZ]...). Therefore, one may try to\ndesign from similar geometric ideas a non-linearly cutoff theory for classical Electrodynamics. An attempt is made in [Br6]. Instead of considering springs linking two\nparticles of opposite charges we rather consider (with a more space-time oriented\n\n\fSome Geometric PDEs Related to Hydrodynamics and Electrodynamics\n\n769\n\npoint of view) surfaces (t, s) \u2192 X(t, s) spanning curves t \u2192 X\u2212 (t) and t \u2192 X+ (t)\nfollowed by two particles of opposite charge, so that X(s = \u22121, t) = X\u2212 (t) and\nX(s = 1, t) = X+ (t), s \u2208 [\u22121, 1] standing for the \"interpolation\" parameter between the two trajectories. Just by prescribing (t, s) \u2192 (t, s, X(t, s)) to be an\nextremal surface in the the 5 dimensional Minkowski space (t, s, x1 , x2 , x3 ) (with\nsignature (\u2212 + + + +)), we get the building block of the model. In other words, the\nindividual Action of each surface is\nZ p\n1 + |\u2202s X|2 \u2212 |\u2202t X|2 \u2212 |\u2202s X \u00d7 \u2202t X|2 dtds,\n(6.1)\n(which is basically the Nambu-Goto Action of classical string theory). Next, we\nassociate with X a \"generalized surface\" (\u03c1, J, E, B) (or more precisely a \"cartesian\ncurrent\" in the sense of [GMS]) defined by\n\u03c1(t, s, x) = \u03b4(x \u2212 X(t, s)), J(t, s, x) = \u2202t X(t, s)\u03b4(x \u2212 X(t, s)),\n\n(6.2)\n\nE(t, s, x) = \u2202s X(t, s)\u03b4(x \u2212 X(t, s)),\n\n(6.3)\n\nB(t, s, x) = \u2202s X(t, s) \u00d7 \u2202t X(t, s)\u03b4(x \u2212 X(t, s))\n\n(6.4)\n\nand subject to compatibility conditions\n\u2202s \u03c1 + \u2207.E = 0, \u2202t \u03c1 + \u2207.J = 0, \u2202t E \u2212 \u2202s J \u2212 \u2207 \u00d7 B = 0.\n\n(6.5)\n\nIn terms of (\u03c1, J, E, B) the Action of X can be written as\nK(\u03c1, J, E, B) =\n\nZ p\n\u03c12 \u2212 J 2 + E 2 \u2212 B 2 .\n\n(6.6)\n\nVarying this Action under constraint (6.5) leads to a system of evolution equations\nfor (\u03c1, J, E, B) (see [Br6] for an explicit form), that we can call \"generalized extremal surface equations\" (GESE). They enjoy (at least in the simplest cases when\nthe solutions depend on one or two space variables) many interesting properties :\nhyperbolicity, linear degeneracy of all fields [BDLL], symmetries between t and s,\nJ and E etc... From the GESE, we can derive through various (formal!) limiting\nprocess 1) the Born-Infeld and the Maxwell equations, as (\u03c1, J) are prescribed at\ns = \u22121 and s = +1 (in which case there is no coupling between charged particles\nand the electromagnetic field), 2) the Vlasov-Born-Infeld and the Vlasov-Maxwell\nequations as (E, B) = 0 is prescribed at s = \u22121 and s = +1 (which corresponds\nto a free boundary condition \u2202s X = 0 for an individual surface and yields a full\ncoupling between charged particles and the electromagnetic field). In spite of the\npossible physical irrelevance of the GESE, their mathematical analysis (global existence, uniqueness, etc...), and the rigorous derivation from them of classical models,\nsuch as the Vlasov-Maxwell equations, are, in our opinion, challenging problems in\nthe field of non-linear PDEs.\n\n\f770\n\nYann Brenier\n\nReferences\n[AK]\n\nV.
