Specific and often very important role is played by orbital degrees of\nfreedom. They can lead to a formation of different superstructures (an orbital ordering) which are associated with particular types of structural phase\ntransitions - one of very few examples where the microscopic origin of these\ntransitions is really known; they largely determine the character of magnetic\nexchange and the type of magnetic ordering; they can also strongly influence\nmany other important phenomena such as insulator-metal transitions (IMT),\netc.\nIn this comment I will try to shortly summarize the main concepts and\ndiscuss some of the well-known manifestations of orbital degrees of freedom,\nbut will mostly concentrate on a more recent development in this field. More\ntraditional material is covered in several review articles [1, 2, 3]. Although I\ntried to cover the main new development in this area, the choice of topics of\ncourse is influenced by my own interests; other people probably would have\nstressed other parts of this big field.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nBasic notions\n\nFive-fold degenerate d-levels of TM ions (l = 2, 2l + 1 = 5) are split in\ncubic crystal field (CF), typical for many TM compounds, into a triplydegenerate t2g levels (orbitals xy, xz and yz) and doubly-degenerate eg ones\n(z 2 = 3z 2 \u2212 r 2 and x2 \u2212 y 2 orbitals), see fig. 1. Further lowering of CF\nto a tetragonal or orthorhombic one splits both t2g and eg levels, whereas\na trigonal (rhombohedral) distortion splits only t2g levels. The shape of\ncorresponding electron wave functions is shown in fig. 2; the notation (x2 \u2212y 2 ,\nxy, etc.) actually describes the shape of electronic density of a corresponding\norbital. Of course, also linear combinations of the basic orbitals are possible,\ne.g.\n|\u03b8i = cos(\u03b8/2)|z 2 i + sin(\u03b8/2)|x2 \u2212 y 2i .\n(1)\n\nx2 - y2\neg\nz2\n\nxy\nt2g\n\nxy, yz\ncubic tetragonal\nc/a > 1\n\nFigure 1: Schematic form of the crystal field splitting of d-levels of transition\nmetal in octahedral coordination.\n\nFigure 2: Typical shape of different orbitals: (a) z 2 = 3z 2 \u2212 r 2 -orbital; (b)\nx2 \u2212 y 2 -orbital; (c) xy-orbital.\n2\n\n\fSuch states, relevant for doubly-degenerate eg orbitals, can be conveniently described by the pseudospin T = 12 (T z = 21 for the z 2 orbital and\nT z = \u2212 12 - for the x2 \u2212 y 2 one) and represented on a diagram of fig. 3.\nNote that in cubic CF the axes x, y and z are equivalent, i.e. the orbital\n|z 2 i = |3z 2 \u2212r 2 i should be equivalent to |x2 i = |3x2 \u2212r 2 i and |y 2i = |3y 2 \u2212r 2 i.\nThese later ones correspond to the angles \u03b8 = \u00b12\u03c0/3 in Eq. (1) and in fig. 3,\nwhich consequently has a 2\u03c0/3 symmetry. This finally leads to a specific\nfrustration in orbital sector even in simple lattices such as cubic ones, e.g. in\nperovskites [1, 4].\n3z 2 - r 2\n\nz\n2\n\nz -x\n\n2\n\ny2 - z2\nq\n\nx\n3y2 - r2\n\n3x 2 - r 2\n\nx2 - y2\n\nFigure 3: Different orbitals, described by Eq. (1), in T x \u2212 T z -plane.\nThe t2g orbitals, e.g. the one shown in fig. 2(c), have two specific features\ndifferentiating them from eg ones:\n(1) In contrast to eg orbitals for which the real relativistic spin-orbit\ncoupling \u03bbl * S is in the leading order absent (eg -states |z 2 i = |lz =0i, |x2 \u2212\ny 2i = \u221a12 {|lz =+2i + |lz =\u22122i}, and the orbital moment is quenched), it is in\ngeneral nonzero for t2g states.\n(2) The shape of t2g wave functions is such that e.g. in 3d lattices they\ncan give rise to 2d and even 1d bands. Thus in perovskite lattices xy-orbitals\nhave significant overlap and hopping only in xy-planes, but practically negligible overlap in z-direction, see fig. 4, and as a result the corresponding\ntight-binding bands would be two-dimensional, with the dispersion in kx , ky ,\nbut not kz . Even more drastic consequences can we have in other lattices.\nThus the corner-sharing TM tetrahedra of B-sites in spinels (topologically\nequivalent to a pyrochlore lattice), shown in fig. 5, have significant direct\noverlap of say xy orbitals along metal chains in xy-planes, xz orbitals -\n3\n\n\falong xz-chains, etc. In effect we would have a collection of 1d bands. This\nfeature (reduced dimensionality) on one hand can lead to specific ordering\nphenomena like Peierls transition [5], see below; and, on the other hand, they\ncan strongly enhance quantum effects in orbital sector ([6], see also [3] and\nreferences therein). Note that in principle one of eg -orbitals, x2 \u2212 y 2 , also\nhas this property (almost no overlap in the third, z direction), thus the occupation of this type of orbital can also lead to a two-dimensional band (this\nis crucial for High-Tc cuprates), although these effects are more pronounced\nfor t2g systems.\n\nFigure 4: The xy-orbitals in a simple cubic (or perovskite) lattice. One can\nsee that there exists strong overlap in xy-plane but practically no overlap in\nthe z-direction.\nSpecific role of orbitals in TM compounds is largely connected with the\nfamous Jahn-Teller (JT) theorem (which, as Teller himself wrote in the preface to the book [7], was actually suggested to him by Landau). In a simplest\nform sufficient for our purposes it states that the high-symmetry state with\nan orbital degeneracy is unstable with respect to a spontaneous decrease of\nsymmetry lifting this degeneracy (we ignore here specific quantum \"vibronic\"\neffects [7, 8] which can be very important for isolated JT impurities, but\nwhich are less significant for concentrated systems which we consider here).\nThis spontaneous lifting of symmetry leads to an occupation of particular orbitals (an orbital ordering (O.O.)), and simultaneously to a structural phase\ntransition with the reduction of symmetry (cooperative Jahn-Teller effect).\nOne can not exist without the other, and it is a definite misunderstanding\nwhen people sometimes are trying to discuss these phenomena as two sepa4\n\n\fsite 1\nTi4O4 or Ir4S4 cube\n\nsite 2\n\nsite 4\nsite 3\n\ny\nx\nz\n\nFigure 5: Overlap of different t2g -orbitals in the B-sublattice of spinels (e.g.\nin MgTi2 O4 or CuIr2 S4 ), showing the formation of one-dimensional bands.\nrate events.1\nAnother question is, which particular effect are we probing by one or another experimental technique. Different techniques are more sensitive and\nmay be predominantly determined either directly by an orbital occupation,\nor by the corresponding lattice distortion. Thus e.g. the resonant X-ray scattering at the K-edge (1s\u22124p transition) [11] is apparently mostly determined\nby lattice distortions [12, 13, 14], although there may exist in principle also a\ndirect electronic contribution [15], apparently weaker in this channel. At the\nsame time the L2,3 absorption (2p \u2212 3d) directly probes an orbital occupation. But in no way does it mean that these (orbital ordering and Jahn-Teller\ndistortion) are two different phenomena and that one can exist without the\nother, or that they can have e.g. different temperature dependence; this is\n1\n\nThere exist different mechanisms of an O.O. and of the corresponding structural distortion: it may be just the electron\u2013lattice, or JT interaction (interaction of orbitals with\nlattice distortions [9]), or it can be a purely electronic (exchange) interaction [10, 1], or\neven a direct quadrupole\u2013quadrupole interaction (relevant for similar phenomena in rare\nearths compounds). But in any case, even if the main driving force of an O.O. is purely\nelectronic, of course the lattice would react and there will appear a corresponding lattice\n(JT) distortion.\n\n5\n\n\fdefinitely never the case.\nAfter this general short introduction I will discuss several (not all, of\ncourse) specific situations and phenomena in which orbitals apparently play\nan important role. I will start with the rather well known cases.\n\n2\n\nOrbital ordering in insulators with\n\"simple\" lattices\n\nTypical examples of orbital effects in TM compounds are met in systems\nwith one electron or one hole in the doubly degenerate eg orbitals - the\nsystem containing Mn3+ (t32g e1g ), Cr2+ (t32g e1g ), Cu2+ (t62g e3g ), low-spin Ni3+\n(t62g e1g ). These ions give rise to a strong JT effect, and all of them have a lowsymmetry ground state with an O.O., in which an orbital degeneracy is lifted.\nThe best known examples are the colossal magnetoresistance manganites,\nwith the prototype material LaMnO3 , or many Cu2+ compounds including\nHigh-Tc cuprates.\nWhich mechanism is responsible for an O.O. in these systems, is still\nnot completely clear. Evidently an electron\u2013lattice (JT) interaction [9, 7] is\nrather strong there. However the electronic (superexchange) mechanism [10,\n1] usually also leads to the same type of orbital ordering as the JT mechanism, and many ab-initio calculations [16, 17] reproduce this O.O. even\nwithout lattice distortion. The relaxation of the lattice decreases the energy\nstill further, but according to these calculations already purely electronic\nmechanism gives about 60% of the total energy gain.\nThe problem is that typically both the mechanisms, JT and the electronic\none, give rise to the same structure. To evaluate the relative importance\nof one or another mechanism of an O.O., it would be very helpful to find\nthe cases where these mechanisms would stabilise different states. One such\npossibility is discussed in [18]. A more detailed discussion of these \"classical\"\ncases of O.O. one can find in the general references [1, 2, 3] cited above.\nAn important question is how one can get the information about an orbital occupation and O.O. Until recently the main, and practically the only\nexperimental method to find out an orbital occupation was the study of\ncrystal structure: by measuring the local distortion of MeO6 octahedra one\ncould get pretty reliable information about the detailed type of orbital occupation at a particular site. Typical situation is the local elongation of\n\n6\n\n\fligand octahedra,2 although in general distortions may be more complicated,\ne.g. containing three types of Me\u2212O distances: two long, two intermediate\nand two short ones. From these data one can get the type of occupied orbitals (1) [21, 22]. If we denote three Me-O distances as l, m and s, the angle\n\u03b8 characterizing the orbital state (1) is given by the expression\n\u221a\n3(l \u2212 s)\ntan(\u03b8) =\n,\n(2)\n2m \u2212 l \u2212 s\nor by the corresponding equation with the change \u03b8 \u2192 \u03b8 \u00b1 2\u03c0\n.\n3\nThe other methods traditionally used to study orbital occupation are\nthose using ESR, and an indirect information about an O.O. one can obtain from magnetic properties of corresponding systems. Also spectroscopic\nstudies are rather informative in this respect (\"ligand field spectroscopy\").\nAn important new development is connected with the use of the resonant\nX-ray scattering (RXS), initiated by Murakami et al. [11]. As mentioned\nabove, depending on the specific version of the method used, one again can\nbe more sensitive to corresponding distortion [12, 13], but there are also the\nways to probe orbital occupation directly, see e.g. [12, 23]. One has already\nstudied by this method many systems containing Mn, Cu etc. One new and\npuzzling phenomenon was observed in many of these studies; in many cases\nthe intensity of a signal which was attributed to an O.O., changed rather\nstrongly below magnetic ordering temperature, even in cases where the O.O.\noccurs at much higher temperatures, so that it has to be already saturated\nat TN . This behaviour was found in manganites [11] in which this increase of\nintensity below TN is about 30%, and in KCuF3 [24], where the effect is even\nmuch stronger: the signal has increased at around TN \u223c 30 K by a factor 2.5,\ndespite the fact that an O.O. exists (and is practically constant) in this\nsystem up to the temperature of its melting or decomposition. What is the\n2\n\nAlthough in the simplest treatment for strong JT ions (partially filled eg -levels) both\nlocal elongation and contraction of ligand octahedra are equivalent, in practice it is not\nthe case: out of hundreds systems with such JT ions with localized electrons there are\npractically none with locally compressed octahedra. This can be explained by higherorder coupling and by the anharmonicity effects [19]. Thus one has to be very careful with\nthe claims sometimes made in theoretical papers, which consider e.g. an alternation of\nelongated and compressed octahedra. Note that the situation may be different in systems\nwith delocalized electrons and with partially-filled bands: these bands may well be formed\nby the \"flat\" orbitals like x2 \u2212 y 2 , with corresponding net tetragonal contraction of the\nsample. This rule is also not true for t2g electrons, for which both signs of distortions (and\nalso trigonal distortions of different sign) are possible in different situations, see e.g. [1, 20].\n\n7\n\n\fexplanation of this effect, is completely unclear at present. One possibility is\nthat there may be a direct contribution of magnetic ordering (via spin-orbit\ncoupling or via interference of different scattering channels) to the signal\nwhich was attributed to an O.O. Whether this possibility may be realised in\npractice, is an open question.\nTo finish with the discussion of the conventional effects connected with\nan O.O., one should mention that it largely determines the character of an\nexchange interaction and the type of magnetic ordering in corresponding systems. This is the essence of the famous Goodenough\u2013Kanamory\u2013Anderson\n(GKA) rules, see e.g. [22, 25]. In short, the main ones of them are: there\nis a strong antiferromagnetic coupling if on corresponding sites the (singly-)\noccupied orbitals are directed towards each other. If however an occupied\norbital is directed towards an empty (or doubly-occupied) one, there will be\na weaker ferromagnetic coupling.\nThe interplay between an orbital occupation and magnetic ordering in\nprinciple gives rise to the possibility of a change of an O.O. at the magnetic\ntransition, but for TN \u226a TO.O. this effect is apparently too weak to explain\nthe anomalies at TN in RXS discussed above.\n\n3\n\nReduced dimensionality due to orbital ordering\n\nSpecific feature of orbital degrees of freedom is an anisotropy of corresponding\nelectron distribution. Consequently, particular orbital occupation can lead\nto the appearance of a strong anisotropy in the properties of such systems,\neven if the original crystal structure is relatively isotropic.\nThere are many examples of this phenomenon. Thus, in undoped manganites with perovskite structure the magnetic ordering is of layered type\n(A-type ordering - ferromagnetic planes stacked antiferromagnetically) [26].\nEven more striking is the example of KCuF3 : in this practically cubic crystal,\ndue to an orbital ordering (alternation of hole orbitals x2 \u2212 z 2 and y 2 \u2212 z 2 )\nmagnetic properties are those of a quasi-one-dimensional antiferromagnet[27,\n10, 1]. Despite cubic lattice, this material is one of the best one-dimensional\nantiferromagnets.\nOrbital ordering can also strongly modify electronic structure and properties of some systems, such as conductivity. Thus, in certain doped man-\n\n8\n\n\fganites, e.g. in Nd1\u2212x Srx MnO3 for x \u223c 0.6, predominantly x2 \u2212 y 2 orbitals\nare occupied, forming corresponding partially filled band. Consequently this\nmaterial has much higher conductivity in the xy-plane than perpendicular to\nit. Apparently two-dimensionality of most High-Tc cuprates, although largely\ndue to their layered structure, is substantially enhanced by the location of\ncharge carriers (here holes) mostly in x2 \u2212 y 2 bands.\nYet another recent example is the new spin-Peierls system TiOCl [28]:\ndue to a particular orbital occupation this material, that structurally is a\nlayered system, electronically becomes quasi-one-dimensional, which finally\nleads to a spin-Peierls transition in it.\n\n4\n\nOrbitally-driven Peierls state\n\nTiOCl is not the only example of quasi-1d behaviour caused by orbital ordering. Even more striking example is provided by some spinels with TM\non B-sites and with partial occupation of t2g -levels. In some of such systems\nquite spectacular superstructures were observed recently: an \"octamer\" ordering in CuIr2 S4 [29] or \"chiral\" structural distortion in MgTi2 O4 [30]. The\nnatural explanation of such strange structures can be found in the concept\nof an orbitally-driven Peierls state [5]. As illustrated in fig. 5, in this crystal structure different t2g orbitals overlap only with corresponding orbitals\nof neighbouring sites along particular directions: xy-orbital with xy along\nxy-chain, xz with xz in xz-chains, etc. As a result the electronic structure\nconsists in a simplest approximation of three degenerate 1d-bands. In both\nCuIr2 S4 and MgTi2 O4 there occurs with decreasing temperature a metal\u2013\ninsulator transition with the cubic\u2013tetragonal lattice distortion. This distortion splits three degenerate bands, so that either only one or two of them\nare partially occupied, figs.6(b), 7(b). In both cases the corresponding bands\nturn out to be 14 or 34 -filled, and as a result the system undergoes a Peierlslike transition - tetramerization along respective directions. It is driven by\norbital ordering (one may call it an ODW - Orbital Density Wave). Simultaneously it also leads to a formation of spin singlets on dimers with orbitals\ndirected towards one another (double bonds in figs.6(a), 7(a)). One can see\nthat the resulting superstructures exactly coincide with those observed experimentally in [29, 30]: they give chiral superstructure in MgTi2 O4 and\noctamers in CuIr2 S4 [5], see figs. 6 and 7.\nOne can argue that similar phenomenon should occur also in some other\n9\n\n\f(a)\n\nzx\n\nyz\n\nyz\n\nzx\nyz\n\nzx\nyz\nyz\n\nzx\n\nz\n\nyz\ny\n\nyz\n\nx\n\nzx\nyz\n(b)\nzx,yz\n\nt2g\nxy\n\nzx,yz\nxy\n\nFigure 6: Schematic band structure and orbital ordering in MgTi2 O4 leading\nto the formation of \"chiral\" superstructure (by [5])\n\n10\n\n\f3+\n(a)\n\n3+\n4+\n3+\n4+\n4+\n\ny\nz\n\n3+\nx\n\n4+\n3+\n3+\n\n(b)\nxy\n\nt2g\n\nzx,yz\n\nxy\nzx,yz\n\nFigure 7: Schematic band structure and orbital ordering in CuIr2 S4 leading\nto the formation of octamers (by [5])\n\n11\n\n\fsystems, e.g. in NaTiO2 [5]. It may be also relevant for the transition to\na spin-gap state in La4 Ru2 O10 [31], and possibly even to an old problem of\nVerwey transition in magnetite [32, 5]. Thus, in La4 Ru2 O10 the appearance\nof a singlet ground state below structural phase transition was originally\ninterpreted in [31] as a transition of each Ru4+ (d4 ) from S = 1 ion into a\nnonmagnetic S = 0 state. However this seems to be rather unlikely, as it\nwould require the splitting of t2g levels larger than the Hund's rule coupling\nJH which for Ru is of order 0.6 eV. Most probably singlet states in this\nsystem are again those on Ru dimers, stabilized by corresponding orbital\nordering. This picture is supported by recent LDA + U calculations [33], and\nit seems to agree with the results of recent inelastic neutron scattering [34].\nAn example of a more complicated singlet Peierls-like state is provided by\nLiVO2 - the system with a quasi-two-dimensional triangular lattice, fig. 8.\nA structural transition accompanied by an opening of a spin gap in this\nsystem may be explained by an orbital ordering with the formation of three\norbital sublattices in it [35], of the type (xy, xz), (xy, yz) and (xz, yz), see\nfig. 9. One sees that as a result of this ordering there will appear strong\nantiferromagnetic coupling in some triangles of V (shaded triangles in fig. 9);\nthis would lead to the formation of singlets on these triangles (three spin 1\nV3+ ions combine into a singlet). One can say that this is a \"next level of\ncomplexity\" - singlets not on dimers, as in Peierls or spin-Peierls case, but\non trimers.\n\nFigure 8: Crystal structure of LiVO2 , showing the formation of quasi-twodimensional triangular lattice of magnetic ions V 3+ (t22g ).\n\n12\n\n\fFigure 9: Three-sublattice ordering of two occupied t2g -orbitals of V in\nLiVO2 [35]. Shaded are the spin singlet triangles.\n\n5\n\nPossible role of orbitals in insulator-metal\ntransitions\n\nIn previous sections we saw that orbital degrees of freedom play an important role in the IMT and in corresponding structural modifications in some\nspinels. However one can argue that this factor has broader significance, and\npresumably orbitals play an important role in IMT in many other systems\nas well. The study of this question is now only at the beginning, thus my\ndiscussion here would have mostly a qualitative character and would rely\nonly on a few examples.\nAmong the best known systems with IMT are vanadium oxides, notably\nV2 O3 and VO2 , see e.g. [36]. As to V2 O3 , the idea of the importance of an\nO.O. in it was suggested long ago [37] and was revived in [38] to explain\nneutron scattering results [39] that the magnetic correlations in the metallic\nphase are quite different from those expected from the long-range magnetic\norder in the insulating phase. O.O was also invoked initially to explain\nthe results of RXS in V2 O3 [40]. And although the initial model of [37]\nis apparently faulted [41], and the results of [40] can be explained without\ninvoking O.O. [42], still direct X-ray absorption measurements [43] show\nthat indeed there is a change of an orbital occupation accompanying IMT,\nalthough it is much weaker than the one considered in [37, 38, 40].\nThe case of VO2 is more interesting from our point of view. The IMT in\n13\n\n\fVO2 , occurring at about 70 C, is accompanied by the structural transition\nfrom the rutile (R) to the monoclinic (M1) phase, in which V chains along\nc-axis of R structure are dimerized, and simultaneously there occurs a \"twisting\" - tilting of V dimers, caused by the antiferroelectric-type shifts of V\nions towards oxygens in ab-plane. As suggested already long ago by Goodenough [44], this \"twisting\" shifts and depopulates antibonding \u03c0 \u2217 -band made\nof V orbitals lying mostly in ab-plane, so that only the 1d band made of one\ntype of t2g orbitals of V, which have strong direct overlap along c-chains, is\noccupied. This 1d half-filled band, in its turn, leads to a Peierls distortion\n(dimerization of c-chain), and finally the material becomes insulating.\nWe see that in this picture the change of orbital occupation at the IMT\nplays crucial role in the transition itself. This picture is now confirmed by a\nnumber of ab-initio calculations [45], and very recently it was proven by the\ndirect X-ray absorption measurements [46]. Thus at least in VO2 the orbital\nreorientation is extremely important for the IMT.\nOne can even qualitatively understand why orbital effects are stronger\nin VO2 than in V2 O3 . There exist a strong tendency of d1 ions to form\nspin singlets in many TM compounds. Besides VO2 , similar phenomenon is\nalso observed in Ti2 O3 [22] and in the Ti Magneli phases, e.g. in Ti4 O7 [47].\nBut this tendency is much less prominent for d2 , d3 , etc, configurations.\nAnd apparently the tendency to form singlet pairs is greatly enhanced by\ncorresponding orbital ordering: it is most favourable for that to put one\nelectron at each site of the pair into orbitals directed towards one another.\nAs I said, the question of the role of orbitals at IMT's is just started to be\ninvestigated, and it is not a priori clear how important is this factor in general;\nit may indeed be system-dependent. But one can give some arguments that\nit can help to explain one general open problem which seems to be quite\ncommon for many IMT's in TM compounds and which did not attract yet\nsufficient attention:\nIn most of the TM systems with IMT the energy gap Eg which opens in\nthe insulating phase is much larger than the corresponding Tc . Thus e.g. in\nV2 O3 and in VO2 Eg is \u223c 0.5\u20130.6 eV, whereas Tc is respectively 150 K and\n370 K; in Fe3 O4 Eg \u223c 0.3 eV and Tc = 119 K, etc. This large discrepancy is\nnot an exception but rather a rule for IMT in this class of compounds. This is\nin strong contrast to the situation e.g. in superconductors or in systems with\nCDW or SDW, where one typically has the values of the gap of the order of\nthe theoretical ones for BCS superconductors, 2\u2206/Tc = 3.5. Such values we\nshould expect also for Peierls transitions (which is actually the case in several\n14\n\n\flow-dimensional materials [48]) or in spin-Peierls systems [49]. Apparently\nthis large discrepancy at IMT in TM compounds is a consequence of strong\nelectron correlations in these systems, and it can serve as a signature of their\nimportance.\nHowever why is it the case, is not really clear. In simple treatments of the\nMott-Hubbard transitions, to get small Tc one would require an extremely\nfine tuning of the parameters (electron hopping t or bandwidth W = 2zt and\nthe Hubbard repulsion U) which determine whether the material would be\na metal or an insulator: typically both W and U are of order of several eV,\nand one indeed needs their almost exact cancellation to get Tc of order of\n100 K, or 0.01 eV. More sophisticated calculations, e.g. DMFT [50], sometimes (re)produce small Tc and large values of Eg /Tc , although one usually\nhas to invoke some extra factors such as frustrations. Physical picture used\nin this approach is that of \"preformed\" gap of order of U (between lower and\nupper Hubbard bands), whereas in the metallic phase close to IMT there\nexists also a small coherent peak at the Fermi-level. But again, the widths\nof this peak which determines the energy scale of IMT is small only when we\nhave fine tuning of W and U.\nOne possible factor which can help to resolve this problem is an eventual change of spin and orbital correlations at the IMT. In real systems not\nonly does the gap close at the IMT, but also magnetic and orbital order, or\ncorrelations, change significantly. Above we discussed the orbital change in\nVO2 . In V2 O3 probably the role of orbitals is less important, but, on the\nother hand, spin correlations change a lot [39], possibly even becoming ferromagnetic above Tc [51]. Orbital modification, e.g. in VO2 , can make the\neffective bandwidth smaller in the insulating case (simply speaking, for example making the energy bands one-dimensional instead of three-dimensional\nones above Tc , or removing the crossing of different bands). Then one can\nhave the situation that W > U above Tc , but becomes (much) smaller below\nit. If so, we would not need such a \"fine tuning\" of W and U, as is required\nin the simple nondegenerate Hubbard model.\nChange of spin correlations (in its turn also connected with the change\nof orbital occupation) can also facilitate strong IMT with opening of a large\ngap, because it can lead to a change of an effective value of the Coulomb\n(Hubbard) repulsion U [43]. Indeed, typically spin ordering or correlations in\nthe insulating state are antiferromagnetic. Then the virtual transition of an\nelectron to a neighbouring site, determining the value of Ueff , is just the usual\nU in the Hubbard model. However, as is often the case, magnetic correlations\n15\n\n\fin the metallic phase are smaller or even become ferromagnetic [51]; then such\nvirtual transition would \"cost\" the energy U \u2212 JH (or several JH in case of\nmany-electron ions), where JH is the intra-atomic Hund's rule exchange (of\norder 0.8\u20130.9 eV for 3d ions). Thus effectively the value of U may strongly\ndecrease above Tc , which can be traced back to the presence and modification\nof orbital occupation at the IMT. This effect again makes the conditions for\nthe IMT less stringent, and can at least partially explain large values of\nenergy gaps in the insulating phase.\n\n6\n\nOrbitals in frustrated lattices\n\nAs I already said, an orbital exchange may be frustrated even in simple lattices such as square or cubic ones [1, 4]. These frustrations would become\neven more prominent in the lattices with geometric frustrations [52], such\nas triangular, kagome or pyrochlore lattices. Frustrated systems attract now\nconsiderable attention, but mostly from the point of view of their spin properties. However orbitally-degenerate frustrated systems also present significant\ninterest. The system which was most widely discussed in this context is\nLiNiO2 , containing low-spin Ni2+ ions with the configuration t62g e1g on a twodimensional triangular lattice, similar to that in LiVO2 shown in fig. 8. This\nstate has both S = 12 and the double orbital degeneracy on this lattice. This\nsystem was first studied as one of the best candidates for the Anderson's\nRVB state, but later it was suggested that there exists in it also an orbital\nliquid state [53]. Experimentally indeed there exist in this system neither\nlong-range magnetic order, nor structural transition required by orbital degeneracy.\nTheoretical treatment of this situation [54] has shown that there exists\na large orbital degeneracy in this system, which however can be lifted by\nthe order-from-disorder mechanism [55, 56]. Magnetic interactions, however,\nwere shown to be predominantly ferromagnetic in the Ni layer. Similar system NaNiO2 indeed shows the behaviour obtained theoretically: there exists\nin it a structural transition with an O.O. at Tstr = 480K, and at lower\ntemperatures - a magnetic ordering with ferromagnetic layers coupled antiferromagnetically [57]. The absence of a long-range magnetic ordering in\nLiNiO2 may be explained by interlayer frustrations [58, 54], which is probably responsible for the spin-glass transition observed in LiNiO2 at about\n8 K [58]). However the absence of JT transition in it is not yet explained.\n16\n\n\f(Recently a short-range orbital order in LiNiO2 was detected by EXAFS [59]\nand by PDF [60]).\n\n7\n\nSome extra remarks\n\nIn this short article I described certain phenomena in which orbital degrees of\nfreedom play an important role. At the end I want also to make a few other,\nsomewhat speculative comments about certain other possible manifestations\nof orbitals in the structure and properties of systems with strongly correlated\nelectrons.\n1) One may argue that the very formation of certain crystal structures is\nat least partially determined by orbital degrees of freedom. The best known\nexample is probably given by many Cu2+ compounds. It is well known that\nbecause of the extremely strong JT effect, Cu2+ always exists either in a\nstrongly distorted (elongated) ligand octahedron, or this elongation is so\nstrong that one or two apex ligands \"go to infinity\", leaving Cu2+ in a 5-fold\npyramid or 4-fold square coordination. These coordinations are very typical\nfor Cu2+ and for many compounds containing it, including such important\nones as High-Tc cuprates. The very existence of e.g. YBCO superconductor\nstructure is largely connected with this factor.\n2) Another, less clear but rather suggestive case, is the structure of hexagonal manganites RMnO3 , R = small rare earth (RE) or Y and Sc.3 Mn3+\nions in these systems are 5-fold coordinated (located in the centre of oxygen trigonal bipyramid). Interestingly, Mn is the only TM element forming\nthis crystal structure: all the others, including e.g. Fe3+ (d5 ) (orthoferrites)\nor Cr3+ (d3 ) (orthochromites) form (distorted) perovskite structure even for\nsmall RE. Why is that, is not completely clear, but one factor may be that\nMn3+ in an octahedral coordination, typical for perovskites, is a strong JT\nion. Probably the combination of JT distortion with strong tilting, required\nfor small RE, is not very favourable (although one can still stabilize RMnO3\nwith small RE in a perovskite structure). Thus it is feasible that, instead of\ntrying to lift the JT degeneracy, the system simply chooses another crystal\nstructure - that of hexagonal YMnO3 , in which this degeneracy is absent.\nIndeed, the CF splitting of 3d-levels in trigonal bipyramid coordination is\n3\n\nThese systems attract now considerable attention because they are one of the best\nknown example of multiferroics - materials that combine magnetic ordering with ferroelectricity [61]\n\n17\n\n\finto two doublets and an upper singlet, and 4 electrons of Mn3+ occupy two\nlowest doublets, so that no orbital degeneracy is left.\n3) Yet another, also rather speculative example of a possible role of orbital degeneracy in apparently unrelated phenomena may be met in TM\ncompounds in which there exist a spontaneous charge, or valence disproportionation. An example of this phenomenon is given e.g. by ferrates\nlike CaFeO3 [62], in which there occurs charge disproportionation 2Fe4+ \u2192\nFe3+ +Fe5+ (of course, this process is never complete, and actually the charge\nmodulation is much less than the one that would follow from this formula,\nbut the quantum numbers of the resulting states indeed coincide with those\nof Fe3+ and Fe5+ ).\nAnother system in which similar phenomenon apparently takes place is\nperovskite nickelates RNiO3 with the low-spin Ni3+ [63]. The appearance of\ntwo inequivalent Ni's was established at least for small RE and Y [64], and\npossibly in all these systems there occurs charge disproportionation of the\ntype 2Ni3+ \u2192 Ni2+ + Ni4+ (another option is that both Ni ions are Ni2+ , but\nthe extra hole is located at every second [111] layer of oxygens [63]).\nInterestingly enough, in both these cases the starting, homogeneous state\nwould correspond to the situation with orbital degeneracy: high-spin Fe4+\n(t32g e1g ) and low-spin Ni3+ (t62g e1g ) are both strong JT ions. It is not actually\nclear if this factor is really important in causing charge disproportionation,\nbut one may argue that this disproportionation is one way to get rid of\norbital degeneracy: instead of doing it via JT distortion, the system does it\nby simply getting rid of the degenerate electron! (the resulting states Fe3+ ,\nFe5+ , or Ni2+ , Ni4+ are all nondegenerate).\nThere are many other effects connected with orbital degrees of freedom\nin TM compounds. I can not dwell on all of them here and will only list\nsome of them with short comments and some references:\n(a) Apparently orbitals play an important role in double exchange in\nmanganites and similar materials. Thus, their inclusion helps to explain the\nabsence of ferromagnetism and the appearance of unusual magnetic structures in overdoped manganites - leading to a marked asymmetry in their\nproperties for underdoped (hole-doped) and overdoped (electron-doped) systems [65]\n(b) In connection with the colossal magnetoresistance manganites, the\nquestion arises what is the orbital state and the role of orbitals in \"optimally\ndoped\" ferromagnetic metallic state. Experimentally at low temperatures\nthere are no indication of JT distortion, even local [66]. One possible ex18\n\n\fplanation is that here we are dealing with an orbital liquid, stabilized by\ndoping [67]. However also a more exotic possibility was discussed in this\ncontext [68] - that with ordering of complex orbitals, of the type of (1) but\nwith complex coefficients, e.g.\n\u221a\n(|z 2 i + i|x2 \u2212 y 2i)/ 2 .\n(3)\nThis state has cubic symmetry and causes no lattice distortion, but it has a\nmagnetic octupole moment.\n(c) Orbitals may play a role in charge ordering (CO), often observed in\ndoped TM compounds. One such example, that of CuIr2 S4 , was already\nmentioned above. Possibly O.O. is also relevant for the low-temperature\nbehaviour of magnetite: recent LDA + U calculations [69] gave such O.O. for\nthe crystal structure obtained in [70].\n(d) In connection with the problem of CO, one has to mention the possibility of two types of it: the conventional site-centered ordering, and a bondcentered one (called Zener polaron state in [71]). Charge/octamer ordering\nin CuIr2 S4 can be viewed both as a site-centered charge and orbital ordering and as a bond-centered formation of spin singlets at certain bonds; the\nsame is true for the insulating state of VO2 and in Magneli phases of Ti and\nV. Similar coexistence of site-centered and bond-centered CO, facilitated by\ncorresponding O.O., apparently may be present in slightly underdoped manganites, and the resulting state may be ferroelectric - a new mechanism\nof ferroelectricity in magnetic systems [72]. This factor can also be important in the low-temperature phase of magnetite Fe3 O4 , and it can explain its\nmultiferroic behaviour [73].\nIn this mini-review I tried to show that the orbital degrees of freedom,\nespecially in case of orbital degeneracy, give rise to multitude of consequences.\nMany of them are already well known, but this field is definitely far from\nclosed and still produces new and new surprises.\nI am very grateful to many colleagues for numerous discussions of these\nproblems, but especially to J. van den Brink, K.
