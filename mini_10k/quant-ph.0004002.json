INTRODUCTION\nThe availability of powerful sources of laser light has permitted in recent\nyears the study of light-matter interaction in regimes where known approximations fail. Indeed, a number of new phenomena has appeared as high-order\nharmonics of the laser frequency, ionization with a number of photons well\nabove the requested threshold and possibly, there are also strong theoretical\nindications of existence of stabilization, meaning by this that the ionization\nrate goes to zero by increasing the intensity of the laser field [1]. There\nhas been a lot of theoretical work following the appearance of those effects\nand, as a general approach, people aims to develop models that account for\nthe physics of strong-laser atom interaction trying to support them both by\nnumerical and experimental work. So, a very succesful model for harmonic\ngeneration has been firstly put forward in [2]. This is the recollision model\nwhere is assumed that the outer electron goes into continuum due to the\nlaser field and here is accelerated by the field, this step being described classically, then it recombines with the core generating the harmonics. A quantum\nimproved version, understanding the emitted radiation as bremsstrahlung radiation due to the electron approaching the core has been given in [3]. This\nimprovement has the advantage that an explanation of the appearance solely\nof odd harmonics of the laser frequency is given. Another quantum account\nof the recollision model has been given in [4]. To obtain these quantum models a number of reasonable assumptions have been made as the disregarding\nof intermediate states, the absence of resonances and so on, that need to be\njustified. These quantum versions of the recollision model prove to be a satisfactory explanation in all the experiments carried out so far with harmonics.\nThen, any theory starting from quantum electrodynamics has to cope with\nsuch a succesful understanding of the situation at hand.\nSince the initial work by Kulander et al. [5] a lot of numerical work is\ncurrently performed to understand strong laser-atom interaction. Anyhow,\nalthough this work is highly interesting our aim in this paper is quite different. That is, we are trying to rederive the recollision model from purely\nquantum arguments without any other approximation than the schemes of\ncurrent experiments in high-intensity laser field require. Our conclusions concern the justification needed to understand the theoretical models discussed\nin Ref. [3,4]. In this light, we take for granted that numerical computations\nsupport the recollision model as the experiments do.\nAfter the pioneering work in [6], a lot of studies have also been carried\nout assuming a simple two-level model. So, one of the open problems in this\nfield of research is if such a simple model really accounts for the physics of\nharmonic generation. In this light, the general structure of the spectrum has\nbeen obtained by Floquet theory and a parallel with the recollision model\nhas been given in [7,8] for the so called cut-off law, that is the rule to obtain\nthe region of the spectrum where the intensity of the harmonics goes rapidly\ndown. It should be said that such a model cannot account for ionization and\n\n2\n\n\fso appears somewhat rough at best.\nIn the light of the above approaches, in this paper we will try to change\nthe point of view beginning directly from quantum electrodynamics, taking\nas a starting point our work in Ref. [9] that here is deepened and improved.\nIndeed, modelling is an important way of understanding but, if one is able to\nsolve the equations of the full theory without resorting to numerical methods,\nagain a deep way to understand physics is also given. So, our main aim is\nto study in depth what is the physics of strong laser-atom interaction by\ndirectly solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The theory we obtain is anyway\nenough general to be possibly applicable to other physical situations where\nstrong electromagnetic fields play a role as e.g for Rydberg atoms.\nIt is interesting to note that, in view of using the dual Dyson series presented in [10] and discussed here by using the Birkhoff theorem [12], the PauliFierz transformation and its classical counterpart, the Kramers-Hennerberger\ntransformation, [13] turn out to play a dominant role. Indeed, when unitary\ntransformations are applied, using probability amplitudes permits to extract\nphysics without worrying about. This is a standard approach e.g. in quantum field theory for the interaction picture. Things do not change for the\ndual Dyson series through the Pauli-Fierz transformation.\nSome approximations to start with are needed, but we take them directly\nfrom the experiments to tailor the Hamiltonian of quantum electrodynamics\nto the kind of problems we want to discuss. So, we take the electromagnetic\nfield to be second quantized and the atom field in the non-relativistic approximation. The quadratic term of the vector potential in the Hamiltonian is\nconsidered just to see, through a single mode approximation, that taking it\ninto account would shift the frequency of the laser in the harmonics. So, the\ncondition to neglect it is also given. Finally, as the wavelengths of interest are\nmuch larger than the atomic radius, the dipole or long wavelength approximation is also taken. Then, a Pauli-Fierz transformation is applied to study\nstrong laser-atom interaction. We will show that only if a large number of\nphotons is present and the amplitude of the quiver motion of the free-electron\nis much larger than the atomic radius, a condition normally met in this kind\nof experiments and a key approximation that we will assume in this paper,\nthan just odd harmonics are generated, assuming the atomic potential to be\nspherically symmetric. Indeed, for a large number of photons the Pauli-Fierz\ntransformation reduces to the Kramers-Henneberger transformation [14] as\nshould be.\nAn interesting result obtained in this way is that, the atom appears to\nbe a kicked quantum system, being this result rigorously derived from the\nHamiltonian of quantum electrodynamics. The kicking hypothesis has been\nassumed for Rydberg atoms in a microwave field firstly in Ref. [15] in order to\nexplain the experimental results about ionization. Indeed, kicking can mean\nlocalization as a counterpart of classical chaos [16]. This is one of the main\nresults of this paper pointing toward the merging of such different fields of\nresearch.\n\n3\n\n\fA kicked Hamiltonian can in principle be solved exactly. Anyhow, we want\nto study an atom in a strong laser field doing perturbation theory. So, we\nwill obtain a perturbation\nseries having the product \u03c9\u03b3 between the Keldysh\nq\nIB\ne2 E 2\nparameter \u03b3 = 2Up , being IB the ionization energy and Up = 4m\u03c9\n2 the\nponderomotive energy for an electric field E, and the laser frequency \u03c9 smaller\nthan the distances, properly shifted by the laser field, between the energy\nlevels. This accomplish the task to obtain a perturbation theory dual to the\nstandard time-dependent theory applied to an atom in a weak electromagnetic\nfield. Using this approach, we are able to show that the rate of above threshold\nionization determines the duration of the harmonics in the spectrum and then,\nalso the form of the spectrum itself by Fourier transform. Beside, if a rough\nmodel for the outer electron in the field of the rest of the atom is taken having a\nCoulomb form with a Zef f for the atomic number to give the correct ionization\nenergy, it can be seen that the duration of harmonics agrees fairly well with\nexperimental results as given e.g. in [17]. This simply means to scale all\nthe formulas for hydrogen-like atoms by ionization potential, ponderomotive\nenergy and laser frequency.\nThe applicability of perturbation theory is indeed possible as, through\na modified Rayleigh-Schr\u00f6dinger perturbation theory one can show that the\nenergy levels of the atom are shifted in such a way to change very little the\nwave function giving a prove of stabilization in the limit of laser frequency\nincreasingly large. This is what we call \"rigidity\" of the wave function, very\nsimilar to the behavior of a superconductor due to the presence of the binding\nenergy of the Cooper pair. This should give a hint, in the framework of\nquantum chaos, to study the change of statistics of such energy levels, possibly\nby some numerical work.\nLet us finally point out that a number of methods have been devised\nstarting from Volkov states, that are the solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nfor a free particle in a plane wave. The prototype of these approaches is\ngiven in Ref. [18]. Anyhow, our point of view assumes different asymptotic\nstates that are naturally derived from dual Dyson series as an entangled state\nbetween the radiation and the atomic state: This is just the leading order\napproximation. Then, e.g. no hypothesys a priori on the atomic potential\nbeing short ranged is needed. On the other side, no general proof is known of\nVolkov states being the proper asymptotic states for perturbation theory in\na strong electromagnetic field. Beside, it appears very difficult to understand\nwhy just odd harmonics are experimentally observed as this approach keeps\nboth odd and even harmonics [19]. Anyhow, an improved version has been\nrecently given in Ref. [20] by the Volkov states in a second quantized field\ngiving just odd harmonics. This approach satisfy the principle of duality in\nperturbation theory but what is changed is the initial state used to obtain the\nperturbation series and is generally presented as a non-perturbative method\nthrough the results for the computation of the amplitudes given in Ref. [18].\nThe paper is so structured. In sec.II we give a brief presentation of duality for the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and discuss the Birkhoff theorem using the\n\n4\n\n\fdual Dyson series. In sec.III we give the Hamiltonian formulation of quantum\nelectrodynamics to start with and show why the quadratic term is negligible.\nThen we perform a Pauli-Fierz transformation to obtain the dual Hamiltonian\nand show how it reduces to the Kramers-Henneberger form. A discussion of\nthe two-level approximation with respect to the full theory is also given. In\nsec.IV we apply the approximation of large amplitude of the quiver motion\nin the laser field with the respect to the atomic radius to show how kicking\narises and why the atomic wave function turns out to be rigid in the sense\ngiven above. In sec.V perturbation theory is done in the tunnelling regime deriving the rate of ionization and consequently the spectrum of the harmonics.\nFinally, in sec.VI the conclusions are given.\nII. DUALITY AND BIRKHOFF THEOREM\nThe duality principle in perturbation theory, when applied to the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation written as (here and in the following h\u0304 = c = 1)\n(H0 + H1 (t))|\u03c8i = i\n\n\u2202|\u03c8i\n\u2202t\n\n(1)\n\nstates that, by choosing H0 as unperturbed Hamiltonian, the perturbation\nseries has a development parameter exactly the inverse of the series obtained\nby taking H1 as unperturbed Hamiltonian. Formally, this latter case means\nthat we are multiplying H1 by an ordering parameter \u03bb going to infinity.\nDuality principle is enough, as shown in Ref. [10,11], to prove that the dual\nto the Dyson series is just the adiabatic approximation and its higher order\ncorrections. Indeed, from the theory of singular perturbation we can rederive\na similar result for the equations of probability amplitudes by the Birkhoff\ntheorem [12], where \"singular\" means that the small parameter multiplies the\nhigher derivative in the equation. In this way, a dual Dyson series can be\nobtained also for the probability amplitudes. In fact, the dual perturbation\nseries is obtained by solving at the leading order the equation\n\u03bbH1 (t)|\u03c8 (0) i = i\n\n\u2202|\u03c8 (0) i\n\u2202t\n\n(2)\n\ntaking \u03bb \u2192 \u221e. But this can be stated as a singular perturbation problem.\nIndeed, using the eigenstates of the unperturbed part H0 |n >= En |n > and\nP\nputting |\u03c8(t) >= n e\u2212iEn t an (t)|n >, one has for eq.(1) the system of linear\ndifferential equations for the amplitudes\ni\u01eb\n\ndam (t) X \u2212i(En \u2212Em )t\ne\nhm|H1 (t)|nian (t)\n=\ndt\nn\n\nbeing now \u01eb = \u03bb1 . If the Hamiltonian H0 has a finite set of N eigenstates and\neigenvalues and considering the amplitudes am (t) as elements of a vector a(t),\nwe can apply a result obtained by Birkhoff on 1908 in singular perturbation\n\n5\n\n(3)\n\n\ftheory [12], that states that the equation (3) has a fundamental set of solutions\nbj (t) with 1 \u2264 j \u2264 N if the eigenvalues \u03bbj (t) are distinct, given by\n\u0014\n\nbkj (t) = exp \u2212i\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nt0\n\n\u0015\n\n\u03bbj (t\u2032 )dt\u2032 exp[i\u03b3j (t)]ukj (t) + O(\u01eb)\n\n(4)\n\nk-th element of the vector bj (t), \u03b3j (t) = tt0 u\u2217j (t\u2032 )i dtd\u2032 uj (t\u2032 ) the geometrical\npart of the phase, uj (t) the eigenstates of the matrix having elements Amn =\ne\u2212i(En \u2212Em )t hm|H1 (t)|ni. The condition of no crossing of eigenvalues \u03bbj (t) is\nalso required. The final leading order approximation is then written as\nR\n\na(t) =\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03b1j bj (t)\n\n(5)\n\nj=1\n\nwith the coefficient \u03b1j given by the initial conditions a(0). Again, we realizes\nthat formally this is the adiabatic approximation applied to the operator\neiH0 t H1 (t)e\u2212iH0 t . Then, we are arrived at similar conclusions as in Ref. [11]\nfor dressed states where, instead, duality principle was used, in the limit\n\u03bb \u2192 \u221e. But, the use of duality principle permits to get rid of the limitation\non the spectrum of H0 being bounded to N eigenstates and eigenvalues and\nthen, it appears as a more general tool to treat also this kind of problems.\nSo, we relax the condition on the spectrum of H0 required by the Birkhoff\ntheorem, as duality permits to give an alternative way to derive it.\nIndeed, one can build the dual Dyson series by also doing an unitary\ntransformation that removes the perturbation H1 (t) in eq.(1). This defines a\ndual interaction picture. In fact, one can see that the unitary transformation\noperator must be a solution of\n\u03bbH1 (t)UF (t) = i\n\n\u2202UF (t)\n\u2202t\n\n(6)\n\nand so UF (t) turns out to be the evolution operator of the adiabatic approximation in the limit \u03bb \u2192 \u221e, proving the equivalence. But, this equation\ncan also be solved exactly in some cases, without resorting to the adiabatic\napproximation giving the series\n\u0014\n\n|\u03c8(t)i = UF (t)T exp \u2212i\n\nZ\n\nt\n\ndt\n\nt0\n\n\u2032\n\n\u0015\n\nUF\u2020 (t\u2032 )H0 UF (t\u2032 )\n\n|\u03c8(t0 )i\n\nwith T the time-ordering operator.\nIII. NON-RELATIVISTIC FORMULATION OF QUANTUM\nELECTRODYNAMICS\nA. Full Hamiltonian and the Quadratic Term\nThe starting assumptions about the formulation of quantum electrodynamics that we need are the following. Firstly, we takes a non-relativistic\n\n6\n\n(7)\n\n\fapproximation and neglect spin effects. Secondly, we cut-off the wavelengths\nlimiting the analysis to the long ones that is, we take the dipole approximation: currently, this is in agreement with the experimental results for harmonic\ngeneration. Finally, we do second quantization on the electromagnetic field\nas we want to understand the properties of the scattered light in experiments\nwith strong fields. So, we write the Hamiltonian in the Coulomb gauge [13]\n(here and in the following h\u0304 = c = 1)\nH=\n\nX\n\n\u03c9k a\u2020\u03bb (k)a\u03bb (k) +\n\n\u03bb,k\n\np2\ne\ne2 2\n+ V (x) + Ap +\nA\n2m\nm\n2m\n\n(8)\n\nwith \u03bb = 1, 2 meaning a sum over polarizations, V (x) the atomic potential,\na\u2020\u03bb (k), a\u03bb (k) the creation and annihilation operators for the mode k with\npolarization \u03bb. So, we have\nA=\n\nX\n\ngk (\u01eb\u2217\u03bb a\u2020\u03bb (k) + \u01eb\u03bb a\u03bb (k))\n\n(9)\n\n\u03bb,k\n\nq\n\nbeing \u01eb\u03bb the complex polarization vector, gk = V2\u03c0\n\u03c9k and a normalization in\na box of volume V is assumed everywhere.\nTo see how much relevant is the quadratic term, we refer to the experimental result that just harmonics of the laser frequency are observed. Then,\nspecializing the above Hamiltonian to a single mode [13], we derive the Heisenberg motion equation for the creation and annihilation operators. So, we take\nH = \u03c9a\u2020 a +\n\np2\ne\ne2 2\n+ V (x) + Ap +\nA .\n2m\nm\n2m\n\n(10)\n\nAssuming a linear polarization, that is\nA=\n\nr\n\n2\u03c0\n\u01eb(a\u2020 + a)\nV\u03c9\n\n(11)\n\nwe can use the same argument given in Ref. [21] that the laser frequency\nshould be shifted by squeezing. Indeed, one has the Heisenberg equations for\na and a\u2020\nda\ne2 g2\neg\n= \u2212i\u03c9a \u2212 i\n(a + a\u2020 ) \u2212 i \u01ebp\ndt\nm\nm\nda\u2020\ne2 g2\neg\n= i\u03c9a + i\n(a + a\u2020 ) + i \u01ebp\ndt\nm\nm\nand without going into details of computation, by duality, as a first approximation, one neglects the atomic Hamiltonian and then, managing p as a\nc-number, the time dependence\nq of the creation and annihilation operators is\n2\nharmonic with frequency \u03a9 = \u03c9 2 + 4\u03c0e\nmV and not just \u03c9 as should be required\nby the experimental results. So, squeezing terms can be neglected otherwise a\nshifted frequency of the harmonics would be observed [21]. This effect should\nbe more pronounced as greater is the order of the harmonic. But, considering this shift with current frequencies and gas densities really negligible,\n\n7\n\n(12)\n\n\fthe quadratic term of the field in the Hamiltonian (8) can be systematically\nneglected giving the final Hamiltonian\nH=\n\nX\n\np2\ne X\ngk (\u01eb\u2217\u03bb a\u2020\u03bb (k) + \u01eb\u03bb a\u03bb (k))p.\n+ V (x) +\n2m\nm \u03bb,k\n\n\u03c9k a\u2020\u03bb (k)a\u03bb (k) +\n\n\u03bb,k\n\n(13)\n\nThis will be the starting point for our further analysis.\nB. Pauli-Fierz Transformation and Kramers-Henneberger Hamiltonian\nWe now try to approach the Hamiltonian (13) using duality principle,\nthat is, we try to compute the dual Dyson series. So, one can remove the\nperturbation by a Pauli-Fierz transformation given by [13]\n\uf8ee\n\nUP F = exp \uf8f0\n\nX\u0010\nk,\u03bb\n\nwhere one has\n\n\u0011\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\u03b2\u03bb\u2217 (k)a\u03bb (k) \u2212 \u03b2\u03bb (k)a\u2020\u03bb (k) \uf8fb\n\n\u03b2\u03bb (k) =\n\n(14)\n\ne\ngk \u01eb\u2217 * p\nm\u03c9k\n\n(15)\n\nand obtains the Hamiltonian [13]\nHP F =\n\nX\n\n\u03c9k a\u2020\u03bb (k)a\u03bb (k) +\n\nk,\u03bb\n\np2\n2m\u2217\n\n\uf8ee\n\n+ V \uf8f0x \u2212 i\n\nX\u0010\nk,\u03bb\n\n\u0011\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\u03b2\u03bb\u2217 (k)a\u03bb (k) \u2212 \u03b2\u03bb (k)a\u2020\u03bb (k) \uf8fb\n\n(16)\n\nbeing m\u2217 the renormalized mass due to the field. Here we try another way,\nto agree with duality in perturbation theory. That is, firstly we consider the\nHamiltonian (13) in the interaction picture giving\nHI =\n\ni\np2\ne X h \u2217 \u2020\ngk \u01eb\u03bb a\u03bb (k)ei\u03c9k t + \u01eb\u03bb a\u03bb (k)e\u2212i\u03c9k t * p.\n+ V (x) +\n2m\nm \u03bb,k\n\n(17)\n\nThen, we solve the leading order equation\ni\n\u2202UF (t)\ne X h \u2217 \u2020\ngk \u01eb\u03bb a\u03bb (k)ei\u03c9k t + \u01eb\u03bb a\u03bb (k)e\u2212i\u03c9k t * pUF (t) = i\n.\nm \u03bb,k\n\u2202t\n\n(18)\n\nThe solution is standard and can be written as\n\uf8ee\n\nUF (t) = exp \uf8f0\u2212\n\nX\nk,\u03bb\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ee\nX\nX\n\u2217\n(t)(\u01eb\u03bb * p)a\u03bb (k)\uf8fb exp \uf8f0 \u03b1k,\u03bb (t)(\u01eb\u2217\u03bb * p)(\u01eb\u03bb * p)\uf8fb\n\u03b3k,\u03bb (t)(\u01eb\u2217\u03bb * p)a\u2020\u03bb (k)\uf8fb exp \uf8f0 \u03b3k,\u03bb\n\uf8f9\n\nk,\u03bb\n\nk,\u03bb\n\n(19)\n\nwith\n\u03b3k,\u03bb\n\ne\n=\nm\n\ns\n\n2\u03c0 ei\u03c9k t \u2212 1\n\u03c9k V\n\u03c9k\n\n8\n\n(20)\n\n\fand\n1\n\u03b1k,\u03bb = \u2212 |\u03b3k,\u03bb (t)|2 .\n2\n\n(21)\n\nSo, we have found in this way a time-dependent version of the above PauliFierz transformation. But now, by eq.(7) we have a dual Dyson series for\nquantum electrodynamics. From this, one has e.g. that the leading order\nwave-function in the interaction picture, if we assume the atom in the ground\nstate, is given by\n|\u03c8 (0) (t)iI = UF (t)|1si|\u03b1i\n\n(22)\n\nbeing |1si the atomic state and |\u03b1i the initial state of the laser field described\nby a coherent state. As it should be expected this is an entangled state\nbetween the atomic state and the field state [21]. It is easy to realize, using\nthe momentum representation for the atomic state, that the scattered light is\nindeed coherent and preserves the property of the initial state for the field.\nOn this basis, we expect the light of the harmonics to be coherent as well\n[21]. In fact, in order to evaluate higher orders in the dual Dyson series we\nrewrite the Pauli-Fierz transformation as\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\u0011\nX\u0010\n\u2217\n\u03b3k,\u03bb\n(t)(\u01eb\u03bb * p)a\u03bb (k) \u2212 \u03b3k,\u03bb (t)(\u01eb\u2217\u03bb * p)a\u2020\u03bb (k) \uf8fb ,\nUF (t) = exp \uf8f0\n\n(23)\n\nk,\u03bb\n\nobtaining the transformed Hamiltonian for higher order computations\nHF =\n\n!\n\np2\np2\n+ V (x) UF (t) =\n+ V [x + X(t)]\n2m\n2m\n\nUF\u2020 (t)\n\n(24)\n\nbeing\nX(t) = \u2212i\n\n\u0011\n\nX\u0010\nk,\u03bb\n\n\u2217\n\u03b3k,\u03bb\n(t)\u01eb\u03bb a\u03bb (k) \u2212 \u03b3k,\u03bb (t)\u01eb\u2217\u03bb a\u2020\u03bb (k) .\n\n(25)\n\nNow, we specialize the above construction assuming that initially the atom\nis exposed to an intense laser field. It is well-known that the creation and\nannihilation operators can be expressed through the number operator nk,\u03bb =\na\u2020k,\u03bb ak,\u03bb and a phase operator by the Susskind and Glogower [23] or the Pegg\nand Barnett construction [24]. But, the distribution probability of the phase\ncan be made to coincide in such a way to give for a coherent state a definite\nphase having quantum fluctuactions that go to zero for a very large mean\nnumber of photon, that is the case of the intensity of the laser field of interest.\nThen, one can keep just one mode and operate the substitution [25]\nak,\u03bb \u2192\n\n\u221a\nnk,\u03bb ei\u03c6k,\u03bb .\n\n(26)\n\nThe Hamiltonian HF is then reduced to the Kramers-Henneberger form [14]\nfor a classical field that is,\nHHK =\n\np2\n+ V [x \u2212 \u03bbL \u01eb(sin(\u03c9t \u2212 \u03c6) + sin(\u03c6))]\n2m\n\n9\n\n(27)\n\n\fwhere a linear polarization has been assumed, all subscripts have been\ndropped and \u03bbL , the free-electron maximum excursion in a monochromatic\neE\nfield, can be rewritten as \u03bbL = m\u03c9\n2 , being E the intensity of the laser field.\nThe above Hamiltonian can be obtained by an unitary transformation, the\nKramers-Henneberger transformation, for an atom in a monochromatic classical field. Then, we simply neglect quantum fluctuaction beyond the leading\norder due to the characteristic of the electromagnetic field. The relevance of\nthis limit for a coherent state is that it makes consistent the arguments that\nfollow about the properties of the harmonics. We just note that the advantage\nof such a derivation is that it gives us the coherence property of the scattered\nlaser light in atomic scattering experiments, and permits to understand the\nway from a quantum electrodynamics formulation to a classical Hamiltonian\nthat fully accounts for the situation at hand.\nAs a general approach, in agreement with the duality principle in perturbation theory [10], we see that to study strong laser-atom interaction we apply\nunitary transformations to remove the big part of the Hamiltonian that in this\ncase is due to the field. We now apply the same idea also to the two-level\nmodel going to a dual interaction picture.\nC. Two-level Approximation\nThe two-level model generally adopted in the study of harmonic generation\ncan be cast in the form (e.g. [8])\nH=\n\n\u2206\n\u03c33 + \u03a9\u03c31 cos(\u03c9t)\n2\n\n(28)\n\nbeing \u2206 the distance between the two-level, \u03a9 the strength of the field, \u03c9 the\nfrequency of the laser field and \u03c31 , \u03c33 the Pauli matrices. The first point to\nnote is that, in order to be in agreement with the recollision model, one of the\ntwo levels should be in the continuum or, at best, \u2206\n2 is the ionization energy IB\n[7]. In this way, one can rederive the well-known cut-off law for the frequency\ne2 E 2\nof the maximum harmonic IB + 3Up , being Up = 4m\u03c9\n2 the ponderomotive\nenergy that in this model should be proportional to \u03a9 as pointed out in\nRef. [7]. But, in this model the continuum is missing and then, ionization\ncannot be described. This means to lose any connection between ionization\nand harmonic generation that, as we will see, plays a role in the duration of\nthe harmonics itself. Finally, let us apply a Pauli-Fierz transformation (or\nKramers-Henneberger transformation) by removing the oscillating term as\n\u03a9\nUF (t) = exp \u2212i\u03c31 sin(\u03c9t)\n\u03c9\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(29)\n\nto obtain the transformed Hamiltonian\nHF =\n\n2\u03a9\n\u2206\nJ0\n2\n\u03c9\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n+ \u2206\u03c33\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=1\n\nJ2n\n\n\u0012\n\n\u221e\nX\n2\u03a9\n2\u03a9\nJ2n+1\ncos(2n\u03c9t) + \u2206\u03c32\nsin((2n + 1)\u03c9t).\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\nn=0\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n10\n\n\u0013\n\n(30)\n\n\fFrom this Hamiltonian is quite easy to realize that both odd and even harmonics play the same role and the only way to make ones or the other appear\nis to choose proper initial conditions. To show that things are really in this\nway, we turn back to Hamiltonian (28) and apply the Birkhoff theorem to\nrederive the spectrum already obtained in Ref. [11], given in a general form\nby the Floquet theory in Ref. [8].\nSo, we have to solve the equation\n\u0014\n\n\u2206\nd|\u03c8(t)i\n\u03c33 + \u03a9\u03c31 cos(\u03c9t) |\u03c8(t)i = i\n2\ndt\n\u0015\n\n(31)\n\nthat in the interaction picture becomes the system of equations\nd\ni\ndt\n\na1 (t)\na2 (t)\n\n!\n\n=\n\n0\n\u03a9e\u2212i\u2206t cos(\u03c9t)\n\u03a9ei\u2206t cos(\u03c9t) 0\n\n!\n\na1 (t)\na2 (t)\n\n!\n\n(32)\n\nto which the Birkhoff theorem can be applied. It should be pointed out\nthat this approximation is consistent with \u2206 \u226a \u03a9 and we take \u03c9 \u226a \u03a9, \u2206,\nin agreement with the identifications of Ref. [7] and in the way the model\nshould compare with experiments. Otherwise, the Birkhoff theorem should\nbe applied differently. Under these conditions, we show that even harmonics\ncan be present depending on the initial conditions. These harmonics are\nknown as hyper-Raman lines in the current literature [8,26].\nFirstly, we note that eq.(32) is the same as eq.(31) when use has been\nmade of the eigenstates of \u03c33 . Then, we can simply use the results of Ref. [11]\nabout the dressed states of Hamiltonian (28) and obtain the Birkhoff basis as\nt\n\u2212i \u2206\n2\n\nb1 (t) = e\n\ni\u03a9\n\u03c9\n\ne\n\n1\nsin(\u03c9t) \u221a\n2\n\n1\n\u2212e\u2212i\u2206t\n\n!\n\n(33)\n\n.\n\n(34)\n\nand\ni\u2206\nt \u2212i \u03a9\nsin(\u03c9t)\n2\n\u03c9\n\nb2 (t) = e\n\ne\n\nei\u2206t\n1\n\n1\n\u221a\n2\n\n!\n\nThen, we conclude that the Birkhoff theorem gives the same results obtained\nby other approaches in Ref. [11,28]. The spectrum is then given by [11]\nh\u03c8(t)|\u03c31 |\u03c8(t)i \u2248 a2 (0)a\u22171 (0)e\u2212i\u2206R t + a\u22172 (0)a1 (0)ei\u2206R t\n2\n\n2\n\n+ (|a1 (0)| \u2212 |a2 (0)| )\u2206\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nJ2n+1\n\nn=0\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03a9\n\u03c9\n\n\u0013\n\ncos((2n + 1)\u03c9t) \u2212 1\n(n + 21 )\u03c9\n\n+ i(a\u22172 (0)a1 (0)ei\u2206R t \u2212 a2 (0)a\u22171 (0)e\u2212i\u2206R t )\u2206\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=1\n\nJ2n\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03a9\n\u03c9\n\n\u0013\n\nsin(2n\u03c9t)\nn\u03c9\n\nthe renormalized level separation. This form of the\nwith \u2206R = \u2206J0 2\u03a9\n\u03c9\nspectrum is in agreement with the one derived by the Floquet theory as given\nin [8]. In the range of validity of this approximation as stated above, this\nproves the assertion that the even harmonics should be considered on the\n\n11\n\n(35)\n\n\fsame ground as the odd ones for the two-level model. As we are going to\nshow, this makes the applicability of this approximation to harmonic generation somewhat unappropriate as the appearance of just odd harmonics in the\nexperiments has a deep physical meaning that here is overlooked. In fact, the\ntwo-level model relies just on the initial conditions to select the properties of\nthe spectrum.\nIV. PROPERTIES OF ATOMS IN INTENSE LASER FIELDS\nA. Odd Harmonics and Kicking for an Electron in a Coulomb Field\nWe now turn our attention to the classical limit of the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian that is, the Kramers-Henneberger Hamiltonian that here we rewrite\nassuming the phase \u03c6 = 0 obtaining\nHHK =\n\np2\n+ V [x \u2212 \u03bbL \u01eb sin(\u03c9t)] .\n2m\n\n(36)\n\nThe potential has the Fourier series [1]\nV [x \u2212 \u03bbL \u01eb sin(\u03c9t)] =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nh\n\nvk (x)ik eik\u03c9t + (\u22121)n e\u2212ik\u03c9t\n\nk=0\n\ni\n\n(37)\n\nwhere\nvk (x) =\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\nTk (x\u2032 )\ndx\u2032\nV (x \u2212 \u01eb\u03bbL x\u2032 ) \u221a\n\u03c0\n1 \u2212 x\u20322\n\n(38)\n\nand being Tk (x) the k-th Chebyshev polynomial of first kind. In this section we study the terms having k > 1, deserving the analisys of the static\ncontribution with k = 0, i.e. the dressed potential, for the next section.\nWe now take the unperturbed potential V (x) to be spherical symmetric.\nIt easily realized that one has different parity for even components being\nv2n (\u2212x) = v2n (x), and odd components being v2n+1 (\u2212x) = \u2212v2n+1 (x). But,\nthe unperturbed part of the Hamiltonian is invariant by parity transformation\nwhile, the odd time-dependent part breaks this simmetry. So, by perturbation\ntheory one has at first order h\u03c8(t)|x|\u03c8(t)i = h\u03c8 (0) (t)|x|\u03c8 (1) (t)i + c.c. being\n|\u03c8 (0) i the initial atomic state such that h\u03c8 (0) (t)|x|\u03c8 (0) (t)i = 0, and the only\nway not to obtain a null spectrum through perturbation theory is from the\nodd components. This result turns out to be in agreement with the general\none obtained through Floquet states in Ref. [27].\nTo apply the above scheme to the Coulomb potential one has to consider\nthe integrals\nZe2\nvk (x) = \u2212\n\u03bbL\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\ndx\u2032\nr\u0010\n\u03c0\n\n1\nx\n\u03bbL\n\n\u2212\n\nx\u2032\n\n\u00112\n\n+\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\ny 2\n\u03bbL\n\n+\n\n\u0010\n\nz\n\u03bbL\n\nTk (x\u2032 )\n\u221a\n\u00112 1 \u2212 x\u20322\n\nbut we have to study them around the origin of coordinates where the\nCoulomb potential turns out to be singular. Indeed, at small distances the\n\n12\n\n(39)\n\n\ftheory given above has its shortcomings due to the dipole approximation and\nthe neglecting of the relativity. Then, some regularization is needed for the\nabove integrals. So, let us study the integrals (39) at the point y = z = a0 ,\nintroducing in this way the cut-off \u03b7 = \u03bbaL0 \u226a 1, and we are reduced to the\nanalysis of the leading term\nvk (x) = \u2212\n\nZe2\n\u03bbL\n\nZ\n\ndx\u2032\nr\u0010\n\u03c0\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\n1\nx\n\u03bbL\n\n\u2212\n\nx\u2032\n\n\u00112\n\n+ 2\u03b7\n\nT (x\u2032 )\n\u221ak\n1 \u2212 x\u20322\n2\n\n(40)\n\nvery near the origin. These integrals turn out to be zero for odd Chebyshev\npolynomials when one takes x = 0 and, for even Chebyshev polynomials one\ngets an extremum such that the integral is bounded. The extremum depends\non \u03b7 but increases slowly. Then, we can remove the even terms, after we take\nv2n at their values at the origin, by an unitary transformation. The same\ncannot be done for odd terms as they go to zero at the origin. These integrals\ncan be studied by a Taylor series at x = 0 giving for the dipolar term\nvkdip (x)\n\nZe2\n=\u2212\n\u03bbL\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\n1\ndx\u2032\nT (x\u2032 )x\u2032 x\n\u221ak\n3\n\u03c0 (x\u20322 + 2\u03b7 2 ) 2 1 \u2212 x\u20322 \u03bbL\n\n(41)\n\nand the integral gives the cut-off dependent approximation\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\nTk (x\u2032 )x\u2032\n1\n2\ndx\u2032\n\u221a\n\u2248 \u2212 log(\u03b7)(2n + 1)(\u22121)n .\n3\n\u03c0 (x\u20322 + 2\u03b7 2 ) 2 1 \u2212 x\u20322\n\u03c0\n\n(42)\n\nthat has a logarithmic divergence for the cut-off \u03b7 going to zero. If we intrdouce the ratio a\u03bbBL \u226a 1 that defines the region where we want to study the\nphysics of the model, we can reabsorb the divergence \u2212 log(\u03b7) as a renormalization into it and introduce the physical ratio \u01eb = \u03c02 a\u03bbBL . This means that we\nhave two\u01eb bare constants \u01eb0 and \u03b7 and this goes to zero through the relation\n\u2212\n\u03b7 = e \u01eb0 with \u01eb the physical ratio. Then, the limit \u01eb0 \u2192 0 implies \u03b7 \u2192 0.\nThrough this redefinition, the dipolar terms are\nvkdip (x) = \u2212\u01eb\n\nx\nZe2\n(\u22121)n (2n + 1)\n\u03bbL\naB\n\nIn this way, we can now prove that the electron in a Coulomb field and an\nintense laser field, such to have the parameter \u01eb \u226a 1, undergoes kicking\nturning the problem into one of quantum chaos [16].\nThe question of a kicked hydrogen atom has been put forward to explain\nexperiments on ionization of Rydberg atoms in an intense microwave field\nthrough the mechanism of dynamical localization [15,16]. Pioneering work\nhas also been done on strong fields and atoms, using kicked models e.g. in\nRef. [29]. But, a rigorous proof of this behavior derived directly from quantum\nelectrodynamics has not been given yet. Here, we accomplish this task by completing the analysis of the time-dependent part of the Kramers-Henneberger\nFourier components. To complete this derivation, we point out that a periodic\nP\ndistribution as \u03b4T (t) = +\u221e\nn=\u2212\u221e \u03b4(t \u2212 nT ) that has period T , can be defined\n\n13\n\n(43)\n\n\ft\n\ni2n\u03c0 T\nthrough the coefficients of its Fourier series. So, e.g. \u03b4T (t) = T1 +\u221e\nn=\u2212\u221e e\nhas all constant coefficients given by T1 . To have convergence of the Fourier\nseries in the sense of distributions, the coefficients fn must satisfy the criterium of being slowly varying [30], i.e. |fn | \u2264 M |n|k , being M and k two\nconstants.\nThen, by using eqs.(43) and one gets the dipolar potential as\n\nP\n\n\u1e7cKH\n\n+\u221e\nX\nX\nZe2 x +\u221e\nZe2 x\ni(2k+1)\u03c9t\n\u01eb\n(2k + 1)e\n= 2\u01eb\n(2k + 1) sin((2k + 1)\u03c9t).\n= \u2212i\n\u03bbL aB k=\u2212\u221e\n\u03bbL aB k=0\n\n(44)\n\nThe Fourier series appearing here has convergence just in the sense of distributions. We now give an explicit form for the dipolar term. Indeed, one\nhas\n+\u221e\nX\n\nT\n\u03b4\u0303 T (t) =\n(\u22121) \u03b4 t \u2212 k\n2\n2\nk=\u2212\u221e\nk\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\nX\n2 +\u221e\nei(2k+1)\u03c9t\nT k=\u2212\u221e\n\n(45)\n\nso that, the dipolar term is defined through the derivative of a periodic distribution of period T2 . One can write at last\n\u1e7cKH = \u2212\u01eb\n\n\u03c0 Ze2 x d\n\u03b4\u0303 T (t) + * * *\n\u03c9 2 \u03bbL aB dt 2\n\n(46)\n\nand we draw the conclusion that the motion of an atom in an intense laser\nfield undergoes kicking with period T2 so that, localization, a typical effect of\nquantum chaos, can happen.\nNow, we show that the Rydberg atoms used in ionization experiments\nwith microwave are indeed in a regime where the ratio between the atomic\ndimensions and the amplitude of the quiver motion of the free-electron \u03bbL in\nthe laser field is largely smaller than unity, and the above theory applies. As a\nstarting point we take Ref. [31] for a typical experiment. The less favourable\ncase is for an intensity of the microwave field of 2.5 V/cm, at 12.4 GHz and\nn2 a\nn2 \u03c9\nthe Rydberg atom has n0 =98. This gives for the ratio \u03bb0 LB = \u221a 0\nthe\n8IB Up\n\nvalue 0.0027, largely lesser than unity. Instead, the most favourable case is\ngiven by the intensity of the electric field of 21 V/cm, at 18 Ghz and n0 =64\ngiving a ratio of 0.00029 improving the situation of about a magnitude order.\nThen, we can conclude that Rydberg atoms are kicked by the microwave field\nand localization can happen, in agreement with all the current researches.\nThis result comes directly from quantum electrodynamics and so, it is fully\njustified.\nFor the case of the harmonic generation\nthe situation is still better because\nq\nIB\nthe Keldysh parameter \u03b3 given by 2Up can be lesser than one permitting\na straightforward application of the perturbation theory. A typical example\nof an experiment in this regime is given in Ref. [17]. This possibility can be\nfully exploited if a set of unperturbed states can be found to do perturbation\ntheory. This is indeed the case as we will see in the next section.\n\n14\n\n\fB. Rigidity of the Atomic Wave Function\nIn order to do perturbation theory, one generally needs a full set of orthonormal functions to start with, representing the unperturbed system. But,\nhere one has to diagonalize the Hamiltonian\nH0 =\n\np2\n+\n2m\n\nZ\n\n1\n\u22121\n\ndx\u2032\n1\nV (x \u2212 \u01eb\u03bbL x\u2032 ) \u221a\n\u03c0\n1 \u2212 x\u20322\n\n(47)\n\nthat is generally an impossible task analitically.\nWhat we want to do is to analyze this problem in the limit where the\namplitude of the quiver motion of the free-electron in the laser field is much\nlarger than the atomic radius, further specializing the above problem to the\nCoulomb potential.\nTo evaluate the degree of deformation due to the laser field in this approximation we apply a modified Rayleigh-Schr\u00f6dinger approximation as obtainable from the time-dependent perturbation series. This can be accomplished\neasily if one makes the multipolar expansion of the dressed Coulomb potential\nin eq.(47) as\n+\u221e\nX\n\u03bbL 2n\nx\nZe2\n1+\nAn\nP2n\nVKH = \u2212\nr\nr\nr\nn=1\n\u221a\nR1\ndxx2n /(\u03c0 1 \u2212 x2 ) and Pn the n-th Legendre polynomial.\nbeing An = \u22121\nSo, we approach the static part of the Kramers-Henneberg Hamiltonian differently from the time-dependent part. The reason to do that is that we\nexpect very large shifts of the energy levels and that just very few terms of\nthe multipolar series (48) really contributes to the matrix elements in the\nRayleigh-Schr\u00f6dinger series.\nThe way we compute the Rayleigh-Schr\u00f6dinger corrections is taken from\nthe time-dependent perturbation theory. Indeed, let us suppose that one can\nneglect the time dependent part of the Kramers-Henneberger Hamiltonian,\nso that one is left with the time-independent problem\n\n\"\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012 \u0013#\n\n(48)\n\nZe2\np2\n\u2212\n+ \u03b4VKH (x)\n2m\nr\n\n(49)\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\nX\nZe2 +\u221e\n\u03bbL 2n\nx\n=\u2212\nAn\nP2n\nr n=1\nr\nr\n\n(50)\n\nHA =\nwhere we have put\n\u03b4VKH\n\nand we want to solve the problem\nHA |\u03c8(t)i = i\n\n\u2202|\u03c8(t)i\n.\n\u2202t\n\nThis is the way stabilization is studied in the Kramers-Henneberger frame\nwhen the limit \u03c9 \u2192 \u221e is taken [1,32]. Here we are able to prove that stabilization indeed exists in the limit of large ratio of free-electron quiver motion\nand Bohr radius due to the rigidity of the atomic wave function.\n\n15\n\n(51)\n\n\fWe take as unperturbed states the ones of the Coulomb problem by setting\n|\u03c8(t)i =\n\nX\nn\n\nan (t)e\u2212iEn t |ni\n\n(52)\n\n!\n\n(53)\n\nbeing\np2\nZe2\n\u2212\n2m\nr\n\n|ni = En |ni.\n\nOne gets for the amplitudes\niam (t) = hm|\u03b4VKH (x)|miam (t) +\n\nX\n\nn6=m\n\ne\u2212i(En \u2212Em )t hm|\u03b4VKH (x)|nian (t)\n\n(54)\n\nand introducing bm (t) = e\u2212i\u03b4Em t am (t), \u03b4Em = hm|\u03b4VKH (x)|mi and \u1ebcm =\nEm + \u03b4Em , we arrive finally at the equations\nibm (t) =\n\nX\n\nn6=m\n\ne\u2212i(\u1ebcn \u2212\u1ebcm )t hm|\u03b4VKH (x)|nibn (t).\n\n(55)\n\nThen, if the shifts \u03b4Em are really large in the limit of large ratio between the\nquiver amplitude of the motion of the free electron and the Bohr radius, the\nRayleigh-Schr\u00f6dinger corrections to the initial wave-function are really small\nand this state is \"rigid\" with respect to the perturbation introduced by the\nlaser field. Indeed, one has\nbm (t) = bm (0) +\n\nX\n\ne\u2212i(\u1ebcn \u2212\u1ebcm )t\n\nn6=m\n\nhm|\u03b4VKH (x)|ni\nbn (0) + * * *\n\u1ebcn \u2212 \u1ebcm\n\n(56)\n\nwhere an adiabatic switching of the perturbation has been introduced. We see\nthat the first order correction gives a modification of the Rayleigh-Schr\u00f6dinger\nperturbation theory as in place of the unperturbed energy levels Em there are\nthe modified energy levels \u1ebcm .

Beside, this contribution is smaller if not zero with respect to the\n\n18\n\n(64)\n\n\flevel shifts. Then, these results strongly support the statement that the firstorder correction into the series (57) is really small in the limit a\u03bbBL \u226b 1 as it\nshould be. This also supports stabilization when the limit of laser frequency\ngoing to infinity is taken, with the ponderomotive energy being constant as in\nthis limit, the time-dependent part of the Kramers-Henneberger Hamiltonian\ncan be neglected [1,32].\nFinally, we conclude that a fairly good approximation for the unperturbed\nHamiltonian for our aims is\nX\n\nHA \u2248\n\nn\n\n\u1ebcn |nihn|\n\n(65)\n\nwhere just diagonal terms are kept and the off-diagonal terms\n\u2032\nHA\n=\n\nX\n\nn6=m\n\n|mihn|hm|\u03b4VKH |ni\n\n(66)\n\nare neglected. We take the Hamiltonian (65) for time-dependent computations\nin perturbation theory.\nV. PERTURBATION THEORY FOR ATOMS IN INTENSE LASER FIELDS\nThe experiments carried out to produce harmonics have a small laser\nfrequency with respect to ionization and ponderomotive energy, then also the\ntime dependent components of the Kramers-Henneberger Hamiltonian need\nto be considered.\nOur aim is to make a perturbaion analysis of the Hamiltonian\nH=\n\nX\nn\n\n\u1ebcn |nihn| + 2\u01eb\u03c9\u03b3\n\nX\nx +\u221e\n(2k + 1) sin((2k + 1)\u03c9t)\naB k=0\n\n(67)\n\nbeing\nZe2\n=\n\u03b3=\n\u03bbL \u03c9\n\ns\n\nIB\n2Up\n\n(68)\n\nthe Keldysh parameter. So, the perturbation theory is applicable in this case\njust when \u03b3 \u226a 1 that defines the so-called tunnelling regime for the electron\nin the laser field. But, the situation here is more favourable as we have just\nto require that the distance between energy levels is much larger than \u03c9\u03b3 and\nwe are able to account for a larger number of experiments than the tunnelling\nregime would permit.\nWe write the equations for the probability amplitudes as\ni\u0227m (t) = \u2212i\u01eb\u03c9\u03b3\n\nX\nn\n\n\u001c\n\ne\u2212i(\u1ebcn \u2212\u1ebcm )t an (t) m\n\n\u001d +\u221e\n\u0010\n\u0011i\nXh\nx\n(2k + 1) ei(2k+1)\u03c9t \u2212 e\u2212i(2k+1)\u03c9t .\nn\naB\nk=0\n\nThen, a generic term, out of resonance, will be written as\n\n19\n\n(69)\n\n\fam (t) = am (0) +\ni\u01eb\u03c9\u03b3\n\nX\nn\n\n\u001d +\u221e\nX\nx\nan (0) m\nn\n(2k + 1)\naB\nk=0\n\"\n\n\u001c\n\ne\u2212i((2k+1)\u03c9+\u1ebcn \u2212\u1ebcm )t \u2212 1\n(2k + 1)\u03c9 + \u1ebcn \u2212 \u1ebcm\n\n!#\n\nei((2k+1)\u03c9\u2212\u1ebcn +\u1ebcm )t \u2212 1\n+\n(2k + 1)\u03c9 \u2212 \u1ebcn + \u1ebcm\n\n+ ***.\n\n(70)\n\nThis result shows that when there are two resonant states m and n in the\nlaser field, then we have Rabi flopping with Rabi frequency given by\n\u03a9R\n= \u01eb\u03b3(2k + 1)\u03c9\n2\n\n\u001c\n\nm\n\nx\nn\naB\n\n\u001d\n\n(71)\n\ndetermined by the (2k + 1)-th harmonic of the laser frequency. This implies a\nsignificant modification of the spectrum of the harmonics with respect to the\nobserved patterns. Otherwise, out of resonance amplitudes are really small\ndue to the large shifts in the limit of large a\u03bbBL ratio. So, the interesting case\nis the resonance with the set of continuous states of the atom representing\nthe situation of the recollision model. In this case, instead of flopping, we can\nhave decay, that means ionization, and a probability for the electron to turn\nback to the core emitting radiation.\nThen, we can apply the Wigner-Weisskopf argument [33] to eq.(70). The\nfirst approximation is to reduce the system to the two levels really resonating\nand to assume all the other amplitudes to be small in the sense given above.\nThis means to approximate eq.(70) by\n\u02270 (t) \u2248 \u2212\u01eb\u03c9\u03b3\n\nX\n\n\u2212i(Ep \u2212E0 )t\n\ne\n\np\n\n\u2212i(E0 \u2212Ep )t\n\n\u0227p (t) \u2248 \u01eb\u03c9\u03b3e\n\n+\u221e\nX\nx\np ap (t)\n(2k + 1)ei(2k+1)\u03c9t\n0\naB\nk=0\n\n\u001d\n\n\u001c\n\n+\u221e\nX\nx\n0 a0 (t)\n(2k + 1)e\u2212i(2k+1)\u03c9t\np\naB\nk=0\n\n\u001d\n\n\u001c\n\n(72)\n\nwhere we have labelled the eigenstates of continuum for the atom by the\nmomentum p and E0 = \u2212IB .

[9], that is\n3\n\n17\n\nX\nxn2\n2 2 2 Ze2 \u03c9 5 +\u221e\n\u2212\u0393|t|\n\u03b3\nh\u03c8(t)|x|\u03c8(t)iR \u2248\n.\n\u0010\n\u0011 cos((2n + 1)\u03c9t)e\n9\n2 5\n\u03c0 3 2 Up2\n2\u03b3\nn=n0 xn +\n3\n\nB\nand n0 is a lower cut-off given by the integer value\nbeing xn = (2n+1)\u03c9\u2212I\n3Up\nsuch that (2n0 + 1)\u03c9 \u2212 IB \u2265 0 firstly foreseen in Ref. [9]. Being scaled in this\nway through Up , IB and \u03c9, a simple model of a single electron in an atom\n\n21\n\n(83)\n\n\fwith atomic number Zef f can be adopted for complex atoms in a strong laser\nfield and the above result used also in this case. As shown in Ref. [9], the\norder of magnitude is correct. The same is true for \u0393 given by\n\u0393=\n\nX\n256 \u03c9 2 2 +\u221e\nIB\n\u03b3\n3\u03c0 2 Up n=n0 (2n + 1)\u03c9\n\u0014\n\n\u00155 \u0014\n2\n\n1\u2212\n\nIB\n(2n + 1)\u03c9\n\n\u00153\n\n2\n\nthat for the experiment described in Ref. [17] yields for helium .012 eV and\nfor neon .01 eV improving the results given in Ref. [9]. This in turn means\nthat the mean lifetime of the harmonics ranges from 52 to 68 fs and, by\ne-folding, after a time of few 102 fs the harmonics disappear in agreement\nwith the experimental results. The result is independent from the order of\nthe harmonics. We expect that the value of \u0393 should be in better agreement\nwith the experimental results when Up increases or being the same, when the\nKeldysh parameter \u03b3 decreases marking the so called tunnelling regime.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have given a full theory of harmonic generation starting from nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics in the dipole approximation. A relation\nwith quantum chaos is obtained through a kicked model that originates from\nthe model at small distances where a regularization procedure is needed. Perturbation theory can be done in the tunnelling regime, where the Keldysh\nparameter is small, as the atomic wavefunction turns out to be rigid due to\nthe way the energy levels are shifted by the laser field. In this way a deep\nconnection between ionization rate and harmonic spectrum is given. Finally,\na fully understanding of the recollision model is obtained and this was our\nmain aim.\n\n22\n\n(84)\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] M. Protopapas, C. H. Keitel and P. L. Knight, Rep. Prog.
