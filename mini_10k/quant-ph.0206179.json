This fundamental principle has been used at the stage of creation\nof quantum theory. It is used to establish correspondence between classical functions\nand operators of quantum mechanics, and to derive the apparent form of the operators\n[1, 2]. Moreover, the correspondence principle points out the way to a simplest asymptotic\nsolution of the Schr\u00f6dinger's equation.\nThe correspondence principle states that the laws of quantum physics must be so\nchosen that in the classical limit, where many quanta are involved, the quantum laws\nlead to the classical equations as an average. In this way, in Ref. [3] this principle has\nbeen used to derive the nonrelativistic semiclassical wave equation appropriate in the\nquasiclassical region and, in Ref. [4], the corresponding relativistic wave equation. It was\nshown that application of the standard WKB method to the semiclassical wave equation\nallows to solve the so called \"insoluble\" problems [4, 5, 6] and results in the existence\nquantum fluctuations of the angular momentum, which contribute to the energy of the\nground state [7].\nThere is a mathematical realization of the correspondence principle known as the quasiclassical approximation which is widely used mainly as the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin\n(WKB) method [8, 9, 10, 11] applicable in the case when the de Broglie wavelength,\n\u03bb = h/p (h = 2\u03c0h\u0304), is changing slowly. This method is usually used as a tool to obtain\nthe approximate solution of the one-dimensional Schr\u00f6dinger's equation in the quasiclassical region at large values of quantum numbers.\nIn this work, we analyze the classical limit of the Schr\u00f6dinger's wave mechanics with\nthe help of the correspondence principle. We investigate solution of the wave equation\n1\n\n\fin the zero-order WKB approximation (WKB0 ) and observe several remarkable features\nand important advantages of the zeroth approximation with reference to the commonly\nused first-order WKB approximation (WKB1 ). These advantages are: 1) the WKB0\nwave function (wf), \u03c80 (x), has no divergencies at the turning points; 2) the WKB0 approximation allows a considerably simpler (than the standard approach based on linear\napproximation) derivation of the connection formulas and quantization condition; 3) the\nWKB0 method allows to solve the wave equation for many-turning-point problems; 4) for\nstationary states, not only energy, but also momentum is the constant of motion; and,\nfinally, 5) the most important advantage is that the WKB0 approach reproduces the exact\nenergy spectra for all known solvable potentials and \"insoluble\" potentials as well.\nSolution of the wave equation in the whole region is built with the help of connection\nformulas we derive in this work, which give the main term of the asymptotic series. To\ndemonstrate efficiency of the WKB0 approach, we calculate exact energy eigenvalues for\nsolvable and some \"insoluble\" spherically symmetric potentials. For discrete spectrum,\nthe WKB0 eigenfunctions are written in terms of elementary functions in the form of a\nstanding wave, An cos(kn x + \u03b4n ), and give the asymptote of the exact solution.\n\n2\n\nThe zero order WKB solution\n\nIt is well known that the exact eigenvalues can be defined with the help of the asymptotic\nsolution, i.e. the exact solution and its asymptote correspond to the same exact eigenvalues of the problem under consideration. The asymptotic solution in quantum mechanics\ncan be obtained by the WKB method. This means that the quasiclassical method can be\nconsidered as a tool to reproduce the exact energy spectrum. This is true for some potentials [12, 13, 14, 15] and has proven for many others with the help of specially developed\ntechniques, improvements, or modifications of the quasiclassical method on the real axis\nand in the complex plane [8, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19].\nThe main problem concerning the applicability of the WKB approximation is the\nproblem of exactness of the method. Proofs of varying degrees of rigor have been advanced that demonstrate the exactness of the standard WKB quantization condition\n[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. The question of exactness of the WKB\napproximation is usually reduced to the estimation of the high-order correction terms.\nThe earliest development of the WKB method for obtaining the high-order corrections\nhas been considered in Ref. [12]. Then, in [13], the radial generalization of Dunham's\none-dimensional WKB quantization condition was derived with the help of the Langer\ntransformation [18]. It was shown that the second- and third-order integrals identically\nvanish for the hydrogen atom and the three-dimensional harmonic oscillator [13]. As we\nshow below, the first order term also does not affect the exactness of the quasiclassical\nquantization condition.\nConsider the static Schr\u00f6dinger's equation with the arbitrary potential V (x) in one\ndimension,\n\uf8ee\n\n1\nd\n\uf8f0\n\u2212ih\u0304\n2m\ndx\n\n!2\n\n\uf8f9\n\n+ V (x)\uf8fb \u03c8(x) = E\u03c8(x).\n2\n\n(1)\n\n\fLet us write the equation (1) in the form,\nd\n\u2212ih\u0304\ndx\n\n!2\n\nh\n\ni\n\n\u03c8(x) = P 2 \u2212 U(x) \u03c8(x) ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere P 2 = 2mE and U(x) = 2mV (x). Equations (1) and (2) are equivalent, but the\nphysical sense of their solutions is different. The Schr\u00f6dinger's equation (1) is the energy\neigenvalue problem, and equation (2) is the eigenvalue problem for the squared momentum\nP 2 . Equation (2) has two solutions for each eigenstate (as it should be for\u221athe secondorder differential equation) with the corresponding eigenvalues Pn(1,2) = \u00b1 2mEn , i.e.\neigenvalues for these two problems are connected via the equality Pn2 = 2mEn for a free\nparticle.\nIn the conventional WKB method, solution of Eq. (2) is searched for in the form\ni\nS(t, x) ,\n(3)\nh\u0304\nwhere A is the arbitrary constant and S(t, x) is the complex function. Substituting (3)\ninto Eq. (2) one finds that S(t, x) satisfies the equation\n\u03c8(t, x) = A exp\n\n\u0014\n\n!2\n\n!\n\ndS\ndx\n\ndS\ndx\n\nd\n\u2212 ih\u0304\ndx\n\n\u0015\n\n= P 2 \u2212 U(x).\n\n(4)\n\nThe Hamilton-Jacobi equation in quantum mechanics (4) is equivalent to the wave equation (2). In the limit h\u0304 \u2192 0 Eq. (4) reduces to the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation.\nIn the WKB approximation one expands S(t, x) in power series of h\u0304, S = S0 + h\u0304S1 +\n2\nh\u0304 S2 + . . . and usually keeps two first terms of the expansion, i.e. S0 (t, x) and S1 (t, x)\n(the WKB1 approximation).\nThis gives, after simple calculations, (dS0 /dx)2 = P 2 \u2212U(x),\nq\nand S1 (t, x) = i ln |p(x)|, where p(x) = dS0 /dx. For conservative systems, the classical\naction S0 (t, x) can be written as S0 (t, x) = \u2212Et + W (x), where W (x) is the Hamilton's\nfunction (reduced classical action). Hence, one gets\ndW\ndx\n\n!2\n\n= P 2 \u2212 U(x).\n\n(5)\n\nq\n\nHere dW/dx \u2261 p(x) = \u00b1 P 2 \u2212 U(x) is the generalized momentum and the WKB1 wf is\ni\nh\n1\n(1)\n\u03c8W KB (x) = q\nC1 ei\u03c6(x) + C2 e\u2212i\u03c6(x) ,\n|p(x)|\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03c6(x) is dimensionless phase variable,\n\n1 xq 2\n1\nW (x) \u2261\nP \u2212 U(x)dx .\n(7)\nh\u0304\nh\u0304\nThere are several disadvantages of the WKB1 approximation. The most essential of\nthem is that the WKB1 wf (6) diverges at the classical turning points given by p(x) =\n0, where the condition for its applicability breaks down. Although this divergence is\nunderstandable in the classical limit, since a classical particle has zero speed at the turning\n\u03c6(x) =\n\nZ\n\n3\n\n\f(1)\n\npoints, it is certainly not present in a quantum mechanical treatment. Since \u03c8W KB (x) is\n(1)\nsingular, tricky matching the wf \u03c8W KB (x) and its first derivative at the classical turning\npoints have been developed [18] that yields the famous connection formulas and well\nknown WKB quantization condition. The exact mathematical conditions under which\nthe connection formulas can be proved rigorously to apply are fairly complex. Other\ndifficulties arising in the WKB1 approximation have been considered elsewhere [3].\nThe connection formulas and quantization condition can be obtained much simpler\nin the WKB0 approximation [20, 21], i.e. in the classical limit h\u0304 \u2192 0. In this case\nS(t, x) \u2243 S0 (t, x) and the general solution of the wave equation (2) for the potential V (x)\ncan be written in terms of the dimensionless phase variable \u03c6(x),\n(0)\n\n\u03c8W KB (x) \u2261 \u03c80 [\u03c6(x)] = C1 ei\u03c6(x) + C2 e\u2212i\u03c6(x) ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere C1 and C2 are taken constant in the classical limit.\nThe WKB0 solution (8) has several important advantages with reference to the commonly used WKB1 wf (6). The most important is that the solution (8) has no divergence\nat turning points. In the phase space, the function (8) has the form of superposition of\ntwo plane waves; it has also such a form in the configuration space (see below). Note,\nthat the WKB0 approximation corresponds to the main term of the asymptotic series in\nthe theory of the second-order differential equations.\n\n3\n\nConnection formulas. Quantization\n\nBasic requirements for the wf in quantum mechanics are continuity and finiteness in the\nwhole region. The famous connection formulas [18] have been derived to connect the\nWKB solution in the classical region with the one in non-classical region. These formulas\nare based on a linear approximation to the potential in the regions around the classical\nturning points where the WKB1 wf diverges; the exact solution involves Bessel's functions\nof order 1/3. Even though the connection formulas themselves turn out to be simple\nenough, their derivation is quite tedious.\nOne of the most important problems to which the connection formulas apply is that\nof penetration of a potential barrier. Interaction with the potential barrier can be of two\ntypes - reflection and transmission. There are several problems in which the conventional\nWKB1 formulas break down [1]. One kind of problems occurs near the top of a barrier,\nwhere the slope of the potential is small. As a result, the straight-line approximation to\nthe potential breaks down, and the connection formulas must be altered. The second type\nof problems arises when the potential changes too rapidly, for example, in the case of a\nsquare well potential. The connection formulas also break down for some other type of\npotentials [1].\nConsider the WKB0 wf (8) for the two-turning-poing (2TP) problem. To build the\nphysical solution in the whole region we need to connect the oscillating solution in classically allowed region with the exponentially decaying solutions in classically inaccessible\nregions. For the 2TP problem, the whole interval (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) is divided by the turning\npoints x1 and x2 into three regions, (\u2212\u221e, x1 ] (region I), [x1 , x2 ] (region II), and [x2 , \u221e)\n4\n\n\f(region III). In the classically allowed region II, right from the turning point x1 , the real\npart of solution (8) can be written in the form\n\u03c80II (\u03c6) = C1 cos(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c61 + \u03b41 ),\n\n(9)\n\nand left from the turning point x2 ,\n\u03c80II (\u03c6) = C2 cos(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c62 + \u03b42 ),\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03c61 = \u03c6(x1 ), \u03c62 = \u03c6(x2 ), and \u03b41,2 , are the phase shifts at the turning points x1 and\nx2 , respectively. In the classically inaccessible regions I and III, to guaranty finiteness of\nthe wf at x \u2192 \u00b1\u221e, we choose the exponentially decaying solutions, i.e.,\n\u03c80I (\u03c6) = Ae\u03c6\u2212\u03c61 ,\n\n(11)\n\n\u03c80III (\u03c6) = Be\u2212\u03c6+\u03c62 ,\n\n(12)\n\nleft from the turning point x1 , and\n\nright from the turning point x2 .\nTo construct solution in the whole region we need to connect functions \u03c80I (\u03c6), \u03c80II (\u03c6),\nand \u03c80III (\u03c6) at the turning points x1 and x2 . Matching the functions \u03c80I (\u03c6) and \u03c80II (\u03c6)\nand their first derivatives at the turning point x = x1 gives\n(\n\nC1 cos \u03b41 = A,\nC1 sin \u03b41 = \u2212A,\n\n(13)\n\nand for \u03c80II (\u03c6) and \u03c80III (\u03c6) at the turning point x = x2 we have\n(\n\nC2 cos \u03b42 = B,\nC2 sin \u03b42 = B,\n\n(14)\n\ntan \u03b41 = \u22121,\ntan \u03b42 = 1,\n\n(15)\n\n\u221a\nC1 = \u221a2A,\nC2 = 2B.\n\n(16)\n\nwhich yields\n(\n\nand\n(\n\nThe connection formulas (15) and (16) supply the continuous transition of the oscillating solutions (9) and (10) into exponential solutions (11) and (12) at the turning points\nx1 and x2 .\nThe function \u03c80II (\u03c6) [given by Eqs. (9) and (10)] should match itself at each point of\nthe interval [x1 , x2 ]. Putting x = x2 we have, from Eqs. (9) and (10),\nC1 cos(\u03c62 \u2212 \u03c61 + \u03b41 ) = C2 cos \u03b42 .\nThis equation is valid if\n5\n\n(17)\n\n\f\u03c62 \u2212 \u03c61 + \u03b41 = \u03b42 + \u03c0n, n = 0, 1, 2, . . .\n\n(18)\n\nand C2 = (\u22121)n C1 . Equation (18) is the condition of the existence of continuous finite\nsolution in the whole region. This condition being, at the same time, the quantization\ncondition. Taking into account the notation (7), we have, from Eq. (18),\n1\n\u2212 U(x)dx = \u03c0h\u0304 n +\n.\n(19)\n2\nx1\nCondition (19) solves the 2TP eigenvalue problem given by Eq. (2). We see that the\nWKB0 approximation results in the quantization of the reduced classical action, W (x),\nand coincides with the well known WKB quantizaton condition. It is important to underline that the first order term does not affect the exactness of the quantization condition.\nIn our case, the condition (19) is obtained by product from general requirements of continuity and finiteness to the wave function in the whole region, i.e. from the requirements of\na smooth transition of the oscillating solution given by Eqs. (9) and (10) to the exponentially decaying solutions (11) and (12) in the classically inaccessible regions. Quantization\ncondition (19) reproduces the exact eigenvalues for all known 2TP problems (see Refs.\n[3, 4, 19]).\nThe derivation given above is evidently much simpler than the usual text book approach for deriving connection formulas and quantization condition. In the general case\nof three or more turning points, phase shifts \u03b41 and \u03b42 will be different [22].\nCombining the above results, we can write the finite continuous WKB0 solution in the\nwhole region (\u03b42 = \u2212\u03b41 = \u03c0/4),\nZ\n\nx2\n\n\u0012\n\nq\n\n\u03c80 [\u03c6(x)] = C\n\nP2\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n\u221a1 e\u03c6(x)\u2212\u03c61 ,\n2\n\ncos[\u03c6(x) \u2212 \u03c61 \u2212\nn\n(\u22121)\n\u221a e\u2212\u03c6(x)+\u03c62 ,\n2\n\n\u03c0\n],\n4\n\n\u0013\n\nx < x1 ,\nx1 \u2264 x \u2264 x2 ,\nx > x2 .\n\n(20)\n\nOscillating part of solution (20) corresponds to the main term of the asymptotic series in\ntheory of the second-order differential equations. In quantum mechanics, the oscillating\npart of Eq. (20) gives the asymptote of the exact solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger's equation\n(see below).\n\n4\n\nMomentum conservation for discrete spectrum\n\nIt is well known that, for discrete spectrum, the asymptote of Eq. (2) has the form\n\u03c8n (x) = An cos(kn x + \u03b4n ), where An , kn = Pn /h\u0304, and \u03b4n are constant values; here kn is\nthe wave number and Pn is the momentum eigenvalue. The asymptote has the form of a\nstanding wave and can be written as a superposition of two plane waves, exp(ikn x) and\nexp(\u2212ikn x), each of which describes free motion. Therefore, for the discrete spectrum,\nthe asymptote of Eq. (2) describes free motion of a particle-wave in the enclosure and\nthe eigenmomentum Pn = h\u0304kn is the constant of motion.\nThe quasiclassical approximation is the asymptotic method, which takes advantage of\nthe fact that the wave length is changing slowly, by assuming that the wf is not changed\n6\n\n\fmuch from the form it would take if the potential V was constant. The WKB0 solution (8)\nis justified in the classical limit h\u0304 \u2192 0, which corresponds to the short-wave asymptote\nof the Schr\u00f6dinger's equation (2). Our basic requirements to the solution (8) are: 1)\nC1 and C2 are constant values and 2) the generalized momentum p(x) = dW/dx is the\nadiabatically slowly changing function, i.e.,\ndW\n\u2243 const.\n(21)\ndx\nThese are the same assumptions which have been originally used by Schr\u00f6dinger to derive\nthe wave equation from the optical-mechanical analogy (see, for instance, Ref. [1]).\nIn this analogy, the most important aspect is the relation to the limiting case of\nwave optics, i.e. geometrical optics. The limiting case of geometrical optics is analogous\nto the classical limit of quantum mechanics: the amplitude of the (wf) is a constant\nand momentum is the adiabatically slowly changing function. Note, the constraint (21)\nsupplies the Hermiticity of the operator p\u03022 = [\u2212ih\u0304(d/dx)]2 in Eq. (2) [3].\nConsider the WKB0 eigenfunction (20) in the classically allowed region given by p(x) >\n0. Show that the oscillating part of the wf (20) is in agreement with the asymptote of\nthe corresponding exact solution of Eq. (2) and can be written in the form of a standing\nwave. In equations (1) and (2), the total energy E and the momentum P are connected\nby means of the equality P 2 = 2mE for a free particle. Integrating (21), we obtain, for\nthe action W (x),\nW (x) \u2243 P x + const,\n\n\u221a\n\n(22)\n\nwhere P = 2mE is the total momentum. Solution of Eq. (1) [or (2)] results in the\n\u221aenergy\nquantization, i.e. E = En . Therefore, W (x) \u2243 Pn x + const, where Pn = h\u0304kn = 2mEn .\nUnderline, this form of the action is valid only for allowed motions in quantum mechanics,\ni.e. for the energies E = En , which can be found with the help of the quantization\ncondition (19).\nThus, the oscillating part of the wf (20) takes the form\n\u03c80II (x)\n\n1\n\u03c0\n= Cn cos\nPn x + n .\nh\u0304\n2\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(23)\n\nThe normalization coefficient,\nCn =\n\nv\nu\nu\nt\n\n2Pn\n,\n\u03c0h\u0304(n + 21 ) + h\u0304\n\n(24)\n\nis calculated from the normalization condition\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\n|\u03c80 (x)|2 dx = 1.\n\n(25)\n\nIn Eq. (23), we have took into account the fact that, in the stationary states, the phasespace integral (7) at the TP x1 and x2 is \u03c61 = \u2212\u03c0(n + 1/2)/2 and \u03c62 = \u03c0(n + 1/2)/2,\nrespectively, so that \u03c62 \u2212 \u03c61 = \u03c0(n + 1/2) [3, 19]. The phase integrals \u03c61 and \u03c62 depend\non quantum number and do not depend on the form of the potential. This form of \u03c61 and\n7\n\n\f\u03c62 guaranties that the eigenfunctions are necessarily either symmetrical (n = 0, 2, 4, . . .)\nor antisymmetrical (n = 1, 3, 5, . . .).\nSolution (23) has the form of a standing wave, which can be written as the superposition of two plane waves. The fact that, for stationary states, the oscillating part of solution\n(23) can be written in such form means that (for conservative quantum-mechanical systems) the particle momentum is the constant of motion and the corresponding coordinate\nis cyclical. Therefore, solution (23) describes free motion of a particle-wave in the enclosure, where the enclosure is the interaction potential. This means that interaction of\nthe particle-wave with the potential reduces to reflection of the wave by the walls of the\npotential.\nAs other integrals of motion in quantum mechanics, the total momentum P can take\nonly discrete values, P = Pn , corresponding to the discrete values of the classical action\nW (x), which can be found from the quantization condition (19). Note that, for a particle\nmoving in the Coulomb potential, the energy eigenvalues can be written in the form of\nthe total energy for a free particle, i.e. En = Pn2 /2m, where Pn = i\u03b1m(nh\u0304)\u22121 is the\nmomentum eigenvalue and n is the principal quantum number. It is easy to show that\nthe energy eigenvalues for other solvable potentials also can be written in such form.\nThere are the following physical grounds to the above discussions. According to classical theory, accelerated electrons radiate energy at a rate equal to 23 e2 c\u22123 \u1e8d2 . But electrons\nin atomic orbits are always accelerated (?) and should, therefore, lose energy continuously\nuntil they fall into the nucleus. Actually, it is known that this never happens. To resolve\nthis problem, Bohr postulated that 1) the electrons are in stationary states, i.e. do not\nradiate, despite their acceleration and 2) electrons can take discontinuous transitions from\none allowed orbit to another. However, the postulate is not an answer to the question:\nwhy the accelerated electrons do not radiate?\nAcceleration means change in momentum. In quantum mechanics, the change in\nmomentum (which is associated with the de Broglie wave \u03bb = h/p, h = 2\u03c0h\u0304) appears\nas radiation of frequency \u03bd = (E \u2212 E \u2032 )/h that means change of the stationary state.\nAs we have shown above, in the stationary states, particles are not accelerated, because\nthe momentum is the constant of motion. This means that, in the stationary states, the\nelectrons move as free particles, particles-waves in enclosures.\nThe well known quasiclassical condition,\nh\u0304 dp\n\u226a1,\np2 dx\n\n(26)\n\ndefines the region of applicability of the WKB1 approximation. Conventional treatment\nof this condition implies that the momentum p(x) is large enough, i.e. quantum number n\ntake large values. At the same time, the WKB method yields the exact eigenvalues for all\nvalues of n, including n = 0 (see Ref. [3, 4, 19]). This means that the condition (26) can\nbe treated differently: it supplies the hermiticity of the squared momentum operator, p\u03022 ,\nthat implies dp/dx \u2243 0, and does not imply that the momentum p(x) takes large values\n[3].\n\n8\n\n\f5\n\nThe multi-turning-point problems\n\nThe WKB method is usually used to solve one-dimensional two turning point problems.\nWithin the framework of the WKB method the solvable potentials mean those potentials\nfor which the eigenvalue problem has two turning points. However the WKB0 solution\n(8) is general for all types of problems. The zeroth WKB approximation allows a considerably simpler derivation of the connection formulas and the corresponding quantization\ncondition not only for two but, also, for many-turning-point problems (\u03bcTP, \u03bc > 2). This\nis the class of the so-called \"insoluble\" problems, which cannot be solved by standard\nmethods.\nThe quasiclassical formulas can be written both on the real axis and in the complex\nplane. Most general form of the WKB solution and quantization condition can be written\nin the complex plane. In the complex plane, the 2TP problem has one cut between turning\npoints x1 and x2 , and the phase-space integral (19) can be written as the contour integral\nabout the cut. The \u03bcTP problems contain (in general case) bound state regions and the\npotential barriers, i.e. several cuts. The corresponding contour C should enclose all cuts.\nThe WKB0 wf in the whole region can be built similarly to the 2TP one considered above.\nLet the problem has \u03bd finite cuts, i.e. \u03bc = 2\u03bd turning points, and the potential is\ninfinite between cuts1 . Then the integral about the contour C can be written as a sum of\ncontour integrals about each of the cut,\nI q\n\nP 2 \u2212 U(x)dx =\n\nC\n\n\u03bd I\nX\n\ni=1 Ci\n\nq\n\nP 2 \u2212 U(x)dx,\n\n(27)\n\nwhere each term of the sum is the 2TP problem,\nI\n\nCi\n\nq\n\n\u0012\n\nP 2 \u2212 U(x)dx = 2\u03c0h\u0304 ni +\n\n1\n.\n2\n\u0013\n\n(28)\n\nTherefore, the \u03bcTP quantization condition is [3, 19]\nI q\n\nP2\n\nC\n\n\u2212 U(z)dz = 2\u03c0h\u0304\n\n\u03bd \u0012\nX\ni=1\n\n1\nn+\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(29)\n\ni\n\nThe condition (29) is in agreement with the Maslov's theory [23]. This means that\nthe right-hand side of the equation (27) can be written as\n2\u03c0h\u0304\n\n\u03bd \u0012\nX\n\nn+\n\ni=1\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n= 2\u03c0h\u0304 N +\n\ni\n\n\u03bc\n.\n4\n\u0013\n\n(30)\n\nwhere N = \u03bdi=1 ni is the total number of zeroes of the wf on the \u03bd cuts. In this interpretation, the number of turning points \u03bc is the Maslov's index, i.e. number of reflections of\nthe wf on the walls of the potential. Thus the condition (29) takes the form\nP\n\nI q\nC\n\nP2\n\n\u03bc\n\u2212 U(z)dz = 2\u03c0h\u0304 N +\n.\n4\n\u0012\n\n1\n\n\u0013\n\n(31)\n\nIn case where the potential is finite in the whole region, the quantization condition will be more\ncomplicate [22].\n\n9\n\n\f6\n\nMulti-dimensional problems\n\nIn most practical applications we deal with the multi-dimensional problems. For known\nsolvable spherically symmetric potentials, the conventional WKB method does not reproduce the exact energy levels unless one supplements it with Langer-like correction\nterms.\nTo overcome this problem in particular case of the Coulomb potential, a special techniques has been developed. In order for the WKB1 approximation to give the exact eigenvalues, the quantity l(l + 1) in the radial equation must be replaced by (l + 1/2)2 [18]. The\nreason for this modification (for the special case of the Coulomb potential) was pointed\nout by Langer (1937) [18] from the Langer transformation r = ex , U(r) = ex/2 X(x).\nHowever, for other spherically symmetric potentials, in order to obtain the appropriate\nLanger-like correction terms, another special transformation of the wf and its arguments\nis required.\nThere are several other related problems in the semiclassical consideration of the radial\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation. (i) TheqWKB solution of the radial equation is irregular at r \u2192 0,\n\u221a\ni.e. RW KB (r) \u221d r \u03bb / r, \u03bb = l(l + 1), whereas the exact solution in this limit is R(r) \u221d\nr l . (ii) The radial equation has no the centrifugal term when l = 0, i.e. the radial problem\nhas only one turning point and one can not use the WKB quantization condition derived\nfor two-turning-point problems. However, solving the equation for l > 0 by known exact\nmethods one obtains energy eigenvalues for all l. (iii) The WKB solution of the angular\nequation has analogous to the radial one, incorrect behavior at \u03b8 \u2192 0: \u0398W KB (\u03b8) \u221d \u03b8\u03bc ,\n|m|\n\u03bc2 = m2 \u2212 h\u03042 /4, while the exact regular solution in this limit is \u0398m\n. Angular\nl (\u03b8) \u221d \u03b8\neigenfunction Y00 (\u03b8, \u03c6) = const, i.e. no nontrivial solution exists.\nPractical use shows the standard leading-order WKB approximation always reproduces\nthe exact spectrum for the solvable spherically symmetric potentials V (r) if the centrifugal\nterm in the radial Schr\u00f6dinger's equation has the form (l + 1/2)2h\u03042 /r 2 . As was shown in\nRef. [19] the centrifugal term of such a form can be obtained from the WKB solution of\nthe angular Schr\u00f6dinger's equation if separation of the original three-dimensional equation\nhas performed with the help of the correspondence principle.\nIn Refs. [3, 19] we have fulfilled the quasiclassical analysis of the three-dimensional\nSchr\u00f6dinger's equation and suggested the quasiclassical approach for multi-dimensional\nproblems. In this approach the original wave equation is reduced to the form of the\nclassical Hamilton-Jacobi equation without first derivatives. It was shown that, in the\nquasiclassical region the wave equation can be written in the form [3, 19],\n(\u2212ih\u0304)\n\n2\n\n\"\n\n\u22022\n1 \u22022\n1\n\u22022\n+\n+\n\u03c8\u0303(~r) = 2m [E \u2212 V (r)] \u03c8\u0303(~r).\n\u2202r 2 r 2 \u2202\u03b82 r 2 sin2 \u03b8 \u2202\u03c62\n#\n\n(32)\n\nSeparation of this equation is performed with the help of the correspondence principle\nbetween classical and quantum-mechanical quantities.

The general solution (8) is the same for all problems in quantum mechanics. In case of multidimensional problems, we use the corresponding multi-dimensional classical action. The\noscillating part of the WKB0 wf (23) gives the asymptote of the exact solution of the\nSchr\u00f6dinger's equation. Most complicate computational part in this approach is calculation of the phase-space integral. In case of multi-dimensional problems, separation\nshould be performed with the help of the correspondence principle between classical and\nquantum-mechanical quantities [7, 19].\n\n7.1\n\nThe linear harmonic oscillator V (x) = 12 m\u03c9 2 x2\n\nConsider first the linear harmonic oscillator. Many problems in physics can be reduced\nto a harmonic oscillator with appropriate conditions. The general differential equation\nfor oscillator potential can be solved using a technique that is frequently exploited in\nsolving quantum mechanics problems. The eigenfunctions that are the solutions of the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation are the Hermite polynomials. In our approach, we directly obtain the asymptote of the exact solution and the corresponding well known exact energy\neigenvalues.\nThe quantization condition (19) appropriate to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with the\nlinear oscillator potential is\nI=\n\nZ\n\nr2\nr1\n\n\u0012\n\nq\n\n2mE \u2212 (m\u03c9x)2 dx = \u03c0h\u0304 n +\n\n1\n.\n2\n\u0013\n\n(37)\n\nThe phase-space integral (37) is calculated in closed form, I = E/\u03c9, that results in the\nexact energy eigenvalues, E = \u03c9h\u0304(n+1/2).

As in case of the Coulomb potential, the WKB\nmethod does not reproduce the exact energy levels unless one supplements it with Langerlike correction terms. This 4TP problem is usually solved with the help of the replacement\nz = r 2 , which reduces the problem to the 2TP one.\n12\n\n\fThis problem can be solved as the 4TP problem in the complex plane. Because\nof importance of the oscillator potential in many applications and with the purpose of\nfurther development of the WKB method, in Ref. [19] the problem has been solved by\ntwo methods, on the real axis as 2TP problem and then in the complex plane as 4TP\nproblem.\nConsider the WKB0 solution of the problem. In the complex plane, the problem has\ntwo cuts, between turning points r1 , r2 and r3 , r4 . To apply residue theory for the phase\nspace integral we need to take into account all zeroes of the wf in the complex plane, i.e.\nthe contour C has to include both cuts. The quantization condition (31) has the form\nI=\n\nv\nI u\nu\nt\nC\n\n2mE \u2212\n\n(m\u03c9r)2\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n~2\nM\n\u03bc\n\u2212 2 dr = 2\u03c0h\u0304 N +\n,\nr\n4\n\n(42)\n\nwhere \u03bc = 4 and C is the contour about the cuts at r < 0 and r > 0, respectively. The\nnumber N = nr<0 + nr>0 , where nr<0 and nr>0 are the numbers of zeroes of the wf at\nr < 0 and r > 0, respectively. For the 3D harmonic oscillator, because of symmetricity of\nthe potential, we have nr<0 = nr>0 = nr , i.e. the total number of zeroes is N = 2nr .\nIntegral (42) is reduced to the above case of the Coulomb potential with the help of\nthe replacement z = r 2 . Integration result is I = \u03c0(E/\u03c9 \u2212 M)/2 and we obtain, for the\nenergy eigenvalues,\n1\n+M .\n(43)\n2\nSo far, as M = (l + 1/2)h\u0304, we get the exact energy spectrum for the isotropic oscillator.\nEnergy of the ground state is E0 = \u03c9(h\u0304 + M0 ), where M0 is the contribution of quantum\nfluctuations of the angular momentum [7]. The asymptotic eigenfunctions have the form\n(38), where the eigenmomentum Pn is calculated with the use of the energy eigenvalues\n(43).\n\u0014\n\n\u0012\n\nEn = \u03c9 2h\u0304 nr +\n\n7.4\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0015\n\nThe Hulth\u00e9n potential V (r) = \u2212V0 e\u2212r/r0 /(1 \u2212 e\u2212r/r0 )\n\nThe Hulth\u00e9n potential is of a special interest in atomic and molecular physics. The potential is known as an \"insoluble\" by the standard WKB method potentials, unless one\nsupplements it with Langer-like corrections. The radial problem for this potential is usually considered at l = 0. However, in the approach under consideration, the quasiclassical\nmethod results in the nonzero centrifugal term at l = 0 and allows to obtain the analytic\nresult for all l.\nThe quantization condition (31) for the Hulth\u00e9n potential is\nI=\n\nv\nI u\nu\nt2m\n\ne\u2212r/r0\nE + V0\n1 \u2212 e\u2212r/r0\n\n!\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n~2\nM\n1\n\u2212 2 dr = 2\u03c0h\u0304 nr +\n.\nr\n2\n\n(44)\n\nIn the region r > 0, this problem has two turning points r1 and r2 . The phase-space\nintegral (44) is calculated analogously to the above case. Introducing the new variable\n\u03c1 = r/r0 , we calculate the contour integral in the complex plane, where the contour\nC encloses the classical turning points \u03c11 and \u03c12 . Using the method of stereographic\n13\n\n\fprojection, we should exclude the infinities at r = 0 and \u221e outside the contour C.\nExcluding these infinities we have, for the integral (44), I = I0 + I\u221e , where I0 = \u22122\u03c0M\nand I\u221e is calculated with the help of the replacement z = e\u03c1 \u2212 1 [3],\nv\nI u\nu\nt2mr 2\n\n~2\nM\ne\u2212\u03c1\n\u2212\nd\u03c1 =\nE\n+\nV\nI=\n0\n0\n1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c1\n\u03c12\n\u0014 \u221a\n\u0015\nq\n\u221a\n\u22122\u03c0M + 2\u03c0r0 \u22122m \u2212 \u2212E + \u2212E + V0 .\n!\n\n(45)\n\nSubstituting the integration result into Eq.

Setting in (46) M = 0, we\narrive at the energy eigenvalues obtained from known exact solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger's\nequation at l = 0. However, in our case Mmin \u2261 M0 = h\u0304/2 at l = 0 and the principal\nquantum number is N = (nr + 1/2)h\u0304 + M0 . As in the previous examples, this apparently\nshows the contribution of the quantum fluctuations of the angular momentum into the\nenergy of the ground state, E0 .\n\n7.5\n\nThe Morse potential V (r) = V0 [e\u22122\u03b1(r/r0 \u22121) \u2212 2e\u2212\u03b1(r/r0 \u22121)]\n\nThe Morse potential is usually considered as one-dimensional problem at l = 0. In this\ncase the problem has two turning points (note that the left turning point, r1 , is negative)\nand can be solved exactly. In the general case, for l > 0, we have an \"insoluble\" 4TP\nproblem.\nFor this potential, let us consider, first, the radial Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which does\nnot contain the centrifugal term at l = 0,\nd\n\u2212ih\u0304\ndr\n\n!2\n\ni\n\nh\n\nR(r) = 2m E \u2212 V0 e\u22122\u03b1(r\u2212r0 )/r0 + 2V0 e\u2212\u03b1(r\u2212r0 )/r0 R(r).\n\n(47)\n\nThe quantization condition (19) appropriate to this equation is\n\u0012\n\nI q\nC\n\n2m[E \u2212 V0 e\u22122\u03b1(r\u2212r0 )/r0 + 2V0 e\u2212\u03b1(r\u2212r0 )/r0 ]dr = 2\u03c0h\u0304 nr +\n\n1\n.\n2\n\u0013\n\n(48)\n\nIntroducing a variable x = e\u2212\u03b1(r\u2212r0 )/r0 , we reduce the phase-space integral to the well\nknown one. Sequential simple calculations result in the exact energy eigenvalues\nEn = \u2212V0\n\n\"\n\n\u03b1h\u0304(nr + 12 )\n\u221a\n1\u2212\nr0 2mV0\n\n#2\n\n.\n\n(49)\n\nNow, let us deal with Eq. (33) for this potential, which contains the non-vanishing\ncentrifugal term, h\u03042 /4r 2, at l = 0. In this case we have an \"insoluble\" 4TP problem. In\n14\n\n\fthe complex plane, the problem has two cuts (\u03bd = 2), at r < 0 and r > 0. Therefore, we\napply the 4TP quantization condition (31),\nI s\n\n2mr02 [E \u2212 V0 e\u22122\u03b1(\u03c1\u22121) + 2V0 e\u2212\u03b1(\u03c1\u22121) ] \u2212\n\n\u03bb2\n1\n= I,\nd\u03c1\n=\n4\u03c0h\u0304\nn\n+\nr\n\u03c12\n2\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(50)\n\nwhere we have introduced the new variable, \u03c1 = r/r0 . The contour C encloses the two\ncuts, but does not enclose the point r = 0. To calculate the integral (50) we use the\nmethod of stereographic projection. For this, we should exclude the singularities outside\nthe contour C, i.e. at r = 0 and \u221e. Excluding these infinities we have, for the integral\n(50) [3],\n\u0012\n\u0013\nq\n2\u03c0r0 \u221a\n\u22122mE \u2212 2mV0 ,\nI = \u22122\u03c0M \u2212\n\u03b1\nand for the energy eigenvalues this gives\n\nEn = \u2212V0\n\n\"\n\n2h\u0304(nr + 21 ) + M\n\u221a\n1\u2212\u03b1\nr0 2mV0\n\n#2\n\n.\n\n(51)\n\n(52)\n\nSetting in (52) l = 0, we obtain,\nEn = \u2212V0\n\n\"\n\n\u03b1[2h\u0304(nr + 12 ) + M0\n\u221a\n1\u2212\nr0 2mV0\n\n#2\n\n.\n\n(53)\n\nEquation (53) for En is different from the expression (49) obtained from solution of radial\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation for the Morse potential at l = 0. This difference is caused by the\nnonzero centrifugal term h\u03042 /4r 2 in the radial equation (33) at l = 0. Thus we obtain two\nresults for the Morse potential: the known exact eigenvalues (49) obtained from solution\nof radial equation at l = 0 and another result (52) obtained from solution of Eq. (33) for\nall l.\n\n7.6\n\nThe relativistic Cornell problem, V (r) = \u2212\u03b1\u0303/r + \u03bar\n\nIn this paragraph, we use the WKB0 approach to reproduce the exact energy spectrum for\nthe famous funnel type potential (Cornell potential) [24] known as one which is \"insoluble\"\nexactly in terms of special functions. This potential is one of a special interest in high\nenergy hadron physics, quarkonium physics, and quark potential models. Its parameters\nare directly related to basic physical quantities of hadrons: the universal Regge slope\n\u03b1\u2032 \u2243 0.9 (GeV/c)\u22122 of light flavours and one-gluon-exchange coupling strength \u03b1s for\nheavy quarkonia. A closer inspections reveals [25] that all phenomenologically acceptable\n\"QCD-inspired\" potentials are only variations around the funnel potential.\nIn relativistic theory, the Cornell potential represents the so-called \"insoluble\" 4TP\nproblem. It is insoluble also from the viewpoint of the conventional 2TP WKB approximation. Show that the WKB0 method and the quantization condition (31) derived above\ngive the asymptote of the exact solution and yield the exact energy spectrum for the\n\n15\n\n\fpotential. To solve the problem, we use the relativistic semiclassical wave equation obtained in Ref. [4]. For a two-particle system of equal masses, m1 = m2 = m, interacting\nby means of the Cornell potential, the relativistic radial semiclassical wave equation is\n(h\u0304 = c = 1)\nd\n\u2212i\ndr\n\n!2\n\n\u03b1\u0303\nE2\n\u2212 m \u2212 + \u03bar\nR\u0303(r) =\n4\nr\n\"\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\n(l + 21 )2\n\u2212\nR\u0303(r),\nr2\n#\n\n(54)\n\nwhere \u03b1\u0303 = 4\u03b1s /3.

Chose a contour C enclosing the cuts\n(and, therefore, zeros of the wf) at r > 0 and r < 0 between the turning points r1 , r2\nand r3 , r4 , respectively. Outside the contour C, the problem has two singularities, i.e. at\nr = 0 and \u221e. Using the method of stereographic projection, we have, for the integral\n(55), I = I0 + I\u221e , where\n\nI\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\nq\n\nI0 = \u22122\u03c0 (l + 1/2)2 + \u03b1\u03032\n\n\u0013\n\n(56)\n\nand the integral I\u221e is calculated in closed form with the help of the replacement of\nvariable, z = 1/r, that gives\nI\u221e\n\nE2\n= 2\u03c0\n+ \u03b1\u0303 .\n8\u03ba\n!\n\n(57)\n\nTherefore, for En2 , we obtain\n\uf8ee\n\n1\n+\nEn2 = 8\u03ba \uf8f02 nr +\n2\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\ns\n\u0012\n\n1\nl+\n2\n\n\u00132\n\n\uf8f9\n\n+ \u03b1\u03032 \u2212 \u03b1\u0303\uf8fb ,\n\n(58)\n\nwhich is the exact result for the Cornell potential.\nIt is an experimental fact that the dependence En2 (l) is linear for light mesons (linear\nRegge trajectories [26]). However, at present, the best way to reproduce the experimental\nmasses of particles is to rescale the entire spectrum assuming that the masses Mn of the\nmesons are expressed by the relation Mn2 = En2 \u2212 C 2 , where En2 = 8\u03ba(2nr + l + 3/2) is the\nexact energy eigenvalues for the linear potential and C is a constant energy (additional\nfree parameter) [27]. The equation for Mn2 is used to shift the spectra and appears as a\nmeans to simulate the effects of unknown structure approximately.\nAt the same time, the required shift of the spectra naturally follows from Eq. (58). The\nCoulomb-like term, \u2212\u03b1\u0303/r of the Cornell potential takes into account the week coupling\neffect that allows to describe the Regge trajectories observed at experiment. For light\nmesons one may expect that the q q\u0304 bound states will feel only the linear part of the\npotential, which gives the main contribution to the binding energy. We thus assume that\nthe Coulomb term can be considered as a small perturbation. Then we obtain, from Eq.\n(58),\n16\n\n\f3\n4\n.\n(59)\nEn2 = 8\u03ba 2nr + l \u2212 \u03b1s +\n3\n2\nEquation (59) does not require any additional free parameter and reproduces the linear\nRegge trajectories as it observed at experiment. We obtain the necessary shift with the\nhelp of the term \u221232\u03ba\u03b1s /3 which is the result of interference of the Coulomb and linear\nterms of the interquark potential. Note that we obtain the correct sign (minus) for this\nterm only in the case of the scalar-like potential. Equation (58) describes the light meson\ntrajectories with the accuracy \u2243 1% [26, 28] (see Table 1).\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\nTable 1. \u03c1 family mesons\nState\n1 3 S1\n1 3 P2\n1 3 D3\n13 F4\n1 3 G5\n2 3 S1\n2 3 P2\n2 3 D3\n23 F4\n\nEn theor\n0.763\n1.319\n1.703\n2.014\n2.284\n1.703\n2.014\n2.284\n2.525\n\nEn exp\n0.768\u2217\n1.318\u2217\n1.691\u2217\n2.037\n\u2212\n1.700\u2217\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\nThe symbol \u2217 denotes the masses of the fitted states; parameters of the fit are: \u03b1s =\n0.75 \u00b1 0.03 and \u03ba = (0.14 \u00b1 0.01) GeV2 .\n\n8\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have considered solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger's equation in the zero order WKB approximation. One might treat the WKB0 solution as a very crude quasiclassical approximation.\nHowever, the WKB0 solution represents the main term of the asymptotic series in theory\nof the second-order differential equations. A proper treatment of the WKB0 approximation opens the way to a simple asymptotic solution of the wave equation.\nIt is a well known fact that the exact eigenvalues can be defined with the help of the\nasymptotic solution. The WKB0 approach gives a simplest way to find the asymptote of\nthe exact solution directly, without solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger's equation, and results in\nquantization of the classical action.\nWe have observed several important advantages of the zeroth approximation with\nreference to the commonly used first-order WKB approximation. Because the general\nWKB0 solution (8) has no divergencies at the classical turning points, this allows a considerably simpler derivation of connection formulas and quantization condition. Using\nthe general requirements of continuity and finiteness for WKB0 function \u03c80 (x) and its\nderivative \u03c80\u2032 (x), we have derived a simple connection formulas, which allowed us to build\nthe WKB0 wf in the whole region and the corresponding quantization condition for the\nclassical action.\n17\n\n\fIf WKB1 approximation is applicable at a distance from the turning points satisfying\nthe condition |x \u2212 x0 | \u226b \u03bb/4\u03c0, the WKB0 solution considered in this work is applicable in\nthe whole region. To demonstrate advantages of the WKB0 approximation we have derived\nnot only well known 2TP but, also, multi-turning-point quantization condition. This\napproach has been also used to derive the quantization conditions for periodic potentials\n[22] and can be easily generalized for nonseparable problems.\nThe most important advantage of the WKB0 approach is that the WKB0 quantization\ncondition successfully reproduces the exact energy spectra for all known solvable potentials\nand \"insoluble\" potentials, too. To demonstrate efficiency of the WKB0 method, we have\nsolved several classic problems. The method successfully reproduces the exact energy\nspectrum not only for solvable one-dimensional and spherically symmetric potentials but,\nalso, for \"insoluble\" potentials with more than two turning points.\nFor discrete spectrum, the WKB0 eigenfunctions have written in terms of elementary\nfunctions in the form of a standing wave, An cos(kn x + \u03b4n ). The fact the eigenfunctions\ncan be written in such form means the solution describes free motion of a particle-wave\nin the enclosure. This, in turn, means that the eigenmomentum is the constant of motion\nand the corresponding coordinate is cyclical.\nThe zeroth approximation reproduces all basic results of quantum mechanics: eigenvalues, asymptotes, probabilities, etc. Obviously, this is more than just an approximation.\nThis is, at least, an alternative quantization method. What is more, we do not even need\nto solve the Schr\u00f6dinger's equation to find the asymptote. After we have fixed the classical action, using the existence/quantization formulas, we can write down the quantization\ncondition for an arbitrary potential.\nThis approach can be easily generalized for the non-separable problems. In this case\nthe classical action can not be written as sum of actions for each variable (degree of\nfreedom). As a result, we cannot have a unique quantum number for each degree of\nfreedom. We will have one quantum number for the non-separable variables, and unique\nquantum number for each separable variable. Asymptote will have the same form, but\nthe existence formulas (quantization condition) will be multi-dimensional integral over\nthe non-separable variables.\nIn the WKB0 method, we use the same technique for all types of problems. The same\nsimple rules formulated for 2TP problems work for \u03bcTP problems, as well. In this sense,\nthe WKB0 approach can be considered as a general method for finding the asymptote of\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger's equation.\nAcknowledgments. The author thanks Prof. Uday P.
