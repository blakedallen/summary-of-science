In addition to previously observed Schottky-like rectification at low bias [Phys.\nRev.

Our results pave the way for\nunderstanding the semiconducting properties of the domains and domain walls in small-gap\nferroelectrics.\nPACS: 73.40.-c, 77.80.Dj\nTopology is the foundation for numerous robust phenomena such as topological defects [1],\nquantum hall effect [2] and topological insulators [3] in condensed matter physics because it is\ninsensitive to continuous deformation or perturbation. Topological defects are pervasive in\ncomplex matter such as superfluid, liquid crystals and the early universe [1, 4]. However, little is\nknown about topological defects in systems with coupled order parameters such as multiferroics,\nwhere magnetism and ferroelectricity coexist [5, 6]. A unique kind of topological defect, where\nsix interlocked structural antiphase and ferroelectric domain walls merge into a vortex core, was\nunambiguously identified in multiferroic hexagonal YMnO3 [7]. The intriguing vortex-antivortex\nnetwork pattern has elegantly been analyzed using graph coloring theory [8]. The band gap of\nhexagonal (h-) REMnO3 (RE = Sc, Y, Ho, ... Lu) is relatively small (~1.7 eV) [9], so the\nconduction properties of ferroelectric vortices may show interesting behavior. In fact, a\nsignificant conduction difference between opposite-polarization \"domains\" has been observed,\nand this conduction contrast was shown to originate from a polarization modulated Schottky-like\nbarrier [7, 10]. Interestingly, the topology of vortex-antivortex network in 3-dimensional crystal\nnaturally results in the presence of numerous \"charged ferroelectric domain walls\" where\nopposite polarizations are facing to each other [8, 11, 12]. Thus, it is imperative to find out the\nconduction properties of these charged domain walls.\nDomain walls are kink solitons that separate domains with different orientations of ferroic order.\nThey may host emergent phases or novel properties such as local conduction in an insulating\nmatrix [13-15]. In conventional ferroelectrics, most studied domain walls are neutral while\ncharged domain walls are rarely observed, which is likely due to unfavorable electrostatic and/or\nstrain energy cost [16, 17]. Experimentally, observed charged domain walls are often associated\nwith defects or needle-shape domains during polarization reversal [18-20]. However, it has been\n*\n\nTo whom correspondence should be address: wdwu@physics.rutgers.edu.\n\n1\n\n\fpredicted that charged domain walls may be stabilized by charged defects or free charge carriers\n[21-23]. In contrast to conventional ferroelectrics, the formation of charged domain walls in\nmultiferroic h-REMnO3 is topologically inevitable because of the presence of highly curved\nvortex cores [8, 11, 12]. In this letter, we report the observation of distinct nanoscale conduction\ncharacteristics of charged ferroelectric domain walls in h-HoMnO3 (a p-type semiconductor)\nusing in situ conductive Atomic Force Microscopy (cAFM), piezo-response force microscopy\n(PFM), and kelvin-probe force microscopy (KPFM) at low temperatures. Local conduction\nspectra indicate that the conduction at tail-to-tail (TT) domain walls is significantly (slightly)\nenhanced at high forward (reverse) bias compared to that of the domains themselves, probably\nstemming from the accumulation hole-like carriers. In contrast, the conduction of head-to-head\n(HH) domain walls shows no enhancement at high forward bias and even suppression at high\nreverse bias, probably due to depletion of hole-like carriers.\nh-REMnO3 are multiferroics with coexistence of ferroelectricity (TC \u2248 1200 \u2013 1500 K) and\nantiferromagnetism (TN \u2248 70 \u2013 120 K) [24, 25]. The ferroelectricity is induced by structural\ninstability called trimerization [26, 27], where corner-shared MnO5 polyhedra buckle to form Mn\ntrimers with induced ferroelectric polarization along the c-axis. The uniaxial nature of the\nferroelectricity allows only 180o domain walls. Combining three structural antiphase domain\nstates (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) and two possible polarization states (+/-), there are totally 6 possible antiphaseferroelectric domain states in h-REMnO3 (\u03b1+, \u03b2-, \u03b3+, \u03b1-, \u03b2+, \u03b3-). In 3-dimension, the six interlocked\nstructural antiphase and ferroelectric domain walls merge to a line called vortex core, which is\nsimilar to vortex lines in type II superconductors. Experimentally curved vortex cores and\ndomain walls along the c-axis were observed in h-REMnO3, forming charged ferroelectric\ndomain walls [8, 11, 12].\nSingle crystals of h-HoMnO3 were grown using the floating zone method. An atomically flat\n(110) surface was prepared by mechanical cleaving in ambient condition. The orientation of the\nc-axis is determined by Lau\u00e9 x-ray back scattering. The sample is glued to a sapphire substrate\nwith Ag epoxy which serves as the back electrode. cAFM, PFM and KPFM experiments were\ncarried out in a commercial variable temperature ultra-high vacuum (UHV) atomic force\nmicroscope (AFM) system [28]. PFM and cAFM were performed in contact mode with\nconductive AFM tip as the top electrode [10, 12]. A high performance current amplifier (noise\nlevel is less than 10 fA at 3 G\u03a9 gain) was used for high sensitivity local current measurement.\nKPFM was carried out in tapping mode with ac bias modulated at 20-100 kHz. The AFM probes\nwere either Pt/Ir or Au coated silicon cantilevers. The images were processed with a free\nsoftware WSxM [29]. Samples for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies were\nprepared by Ar ion milling at liquid nitrogen temperature. A JEOL-2000FX and a JEOL-2010F\nTEM operating at 200 kV were used for the observations at room temperature.\n\n2\n\n\fFIG. 1.

(c) Zoom-in\ncartoon of HH (TT) domain walls with positive (negative) bound charges.\nFigure 1(a) shows typical room temperature TEM dark field images of h-HoMnO3 taken with the\nelectron beam either close to parallel (top view) or perpendicular (side view) to the\ncrystallographic c-axis. The observation of vortex pattern on the side view image demonstrates\nthat curved vortex cores force the associated domain walls to intercept the polarization direction\n(the c-axis), as illustrated in the cartoon in Fig. 1(b). Therefore, these domain walls carry bound\ncharges due to antagonistic polarizations as illustrated in Fig.1 (c). In this sense, the charged\ndomain walls in h-REMnO3 are \"protected\" by the formation of vortices, instead of being\nrandomly pinned by extrinsic defects. In conventional ferroelectrics, charged domain walls are\nthermodynamically unstable because of extra electrostatic or strain energy cost [17]. However, hREMnO3 are improper ferroelectrics where the ferroelectricity is a by-product of primary\nstructural trimerization. Previous first principle calculations revealed that the ferroelectric order\nparameter (polarization) is a cubic function of the primary order near TC [27]. Therefore, the\nmagnitude of the ferroelectric polarization is negligibly small in the proximity of TC. In other\nwords, the ferroelectric polarization and the associated electrostatic energy cost are irrelevant to\nthe formation of the vortex-antivortex network near TC. In addition, thermally-excited charge\ncarriers can effectively screen charged domain walls because h-REMnO3 are small band gap\nsemiconductors [9, 30]. From thermodynamic considerations, the proliferation of vortexantivortex pairs and highly-curved vortex cores are more favorable because of the domination of\nthe entropy contribution to the free energy at high temperature [1].\n\nFIG. 2 (color online) (a) Topographic and (b), PFM (Vex= 22 V, f=21 kHz) images taken\nsimultaneously at 300 K.

The arrows indicate in-plane polarization orientation determined\nfrom the phase of PFM signal. Color scales are 4.5 nm, 8 pm and 0.4 nA for topography, PFM\nand cAFM images respectively.\n3\n\n\fHow vortices propagate along the c-axis can also be revealed by in-plane PFM with the c-axis in\nthe surface plane [11, 12]. As seen in the topography image (shown in figure 2(a)), we are able to\nobtain an atomically flat (110) surface of a HoMnO3 single crystal by mechanical cleaving. Fig.\n2(b) shows the PFM images taken at room temperature to reveal ferroelectric domain pattern.\nWe aligned the orientation of conductive cantilever so that it was parallel to the c-axis, which is\nalong the slow scan axis (vertical direction). In this configuration, the PFM signal (vertical\ndeflection) originates from the buckling of the cantilever caused by shear deformation of inplane ferroelectric domains in the presence of an out-of-plane electric field [12, 31]. The dark\nand bright contrasts represent in-plane up and down ferroelectric domains, respectively. The\ndirection of local polarization is determined by the phase of the PFM signal and is further\nconfirmed by KPFM measurements at 65 K [32]. Fig. 2(c) shows the derivative image of PFM (b)\nimage that highlights the HH (dark) and TT (bright) domain walls, respectively.\nIn cAFM images with Vtip=-10 V, there is no conduction (current) contrast between different\ndomains, as shown in Fig. 2(d). In contrast, there are line features with significant extra current.\nMore interestingly, these lines overlap with the ferroelectric domain walls observed by PFM at\nthe same location. By correlating PFM and cAFM images at the same location, we can identify\ntwo vortices in this area, as illustrated in the cartoon sketch in Fig. 2(e). Note that the fast\nrastering of the cantilever artificially broadens the apparent width of some conduction lines. In\nthe conductance image with very slow rastering (e.g. in Fig. 4), the observed width of conduction\npeaks is ~80-100 nm, which is comparable with the diameter ( \u2264100 nm) of our conductive tip.\nTo better illustrate the correlation between local conduction and ferroelectric domain walls, line\nprofiles of PFM and cAFM images are plotted in Fig. 3(a). Clearly, significant enhancement\n(~25%) of current is observed at 180\u00b0 TT domain walls. On the other hand, there is no current\nenhancement at HH domain walls. Interestingly, some conduction enhancement was observed in\nneutral domain walls that are running along the c-axis. The intriguing conduction enhancement at\n180\u00b0 TT domain walls has been confirmed in multiple locations of our single crystal sample\nusing various AFM cantilevers with different conductive coating materials (see supplemental\nmaterial), suggesting this is an intrinsic property of h-HoMnO3.\n\nFIG. 3 (color online) (a) The PFM signal profile along the line on PFM image.

(d) Schematic diagrams of band bending near\ncharged domain walls. Upper panel: HH domain walls, lower panel: TT domain walls.\n4\n\n\fPrevious cAFM studies on the (001) surface of h-HoMnO3 suggest that the non-linear I-V\ncharacteristics originate from a Schottky-like barrier between the tip (a metal) and crystal (a ptype semiconductor). In the (001) orientation, the polarization of the ferroelectric domains is\neither into or out of the surface plane; as a result, bound charges at the surface modulate the\nheight of the Schottky-like barrier leading to an observable conduction contrast between opposite\npolarization domains in the cAFM images and I-V curves [10]. On the (110) surface of HoMnO3\nexplored in this work, the ferroelectric polarization is parallel to the surface and therefore there is\nno bound charge on the surface. Therefore, no conduction difference between opposite domains\nis expected at a given bias, which is consistent with lack of current contrast between opposite\npolarization domains in the cAFM images in Fig. 2(d) and Fig. 3(b). It has been predicted that\ncharged 180o domain walls in ferroelectric semiconductors can attract free charge carriers with\nopposite sign, e.g. TT (HH) domain walls attract holes (electrons) [22, 23], and result in band\nbending. Since HoMnO3 is a p-type semiconductor [33], the TT ferroelectric domain walls\n(which attract holes) should have enhanced conduction, while the HH domain walls (which repel\nholes) should have reduced conduction. This scenario, shown schematically in the band diagrams\nin Fig. 3(d), is qualitatively consistent with our observation.\n\nFIG. 4 (color online) (a) Areal averaged I-V curves of ferroelectric domain (black), TT (red), HH\n(cyan) and neutral (green) domain walls. (b) \u0394I-V curves of TT, HH and neutral domain walls\nafter subtracting the areal average I-V curve of domains. The blue line is a linear fit function\n(slope=49.0\u00b10.7 pA/V) for -10 V<Vtip<-5V. (c)-(f) cAFM images of HoMnO3 (110) surface\ntaken with the spectro-microscopy mode. The biases (color scales) are -10 V (0.55 nA), -5 V\n(0.15 nA), 5 V (0.07 nA) and 10 V (0.35 nA), respectively. Brighter contrast corresponds to\nlarger absolute current value.\nIn order to understand the conduction mechanism of charged domain walls in h-HoMnO3, we\nperformed I-V spectro-microscopy measurements where an I-V curve was measured at each pixel\nin the scanned area [10]. Areal average I-V curves at domains, TT, HH and neutral domain walls\nare shown in Fig. 4(a), respectively. Consistent with previous results in ref. [10], the I-V curves\n5\n\n\fare nonlinear due to the Schottky-like barrier formed at tip-sample interface. The forward current\nat negative tip bias is consistent with the p-type character of the charge carriers in HoMnO3 [10,\n33]. Clearly, the TT domain wall is more conductive than the domains at high forward bias\n(Vtip<-5 V). The enhancement is smaller at reverse bias (Vtip>5 V). On the other hand, HH\ndomain walls are less conductive than the domains themselves. To isolate the I-V character of the\nenhancement, we plotted the current difference (\u2206I) between the TT domain wall and the domain\nagainst the bias voltage (Vtip) (shown in Fig. 4(b)). Interestingly, the \u2206I-V curve shows an\napproximately linear increase (slope\u224849 pA/V) beyond a forward bias Vtip<-5 V, which can be\ndescribed by a linear fit function (the blue line in Fig. 4(b)): \u2206I=49\u00d7(Vtip+4.45) (pA). We\nobserved similar linear \u2206I-V characteristics (slope\u224845 pA/V) at a different location with a\ndifferent conductive AFM tip (see supplemental material), suggesting this enhancement is an\nintrinsic property of TT domain walls. The conduction enhancement indicates that there is a\nsignificant density of charge carriers in the proximity of TT domain walls, possibly forming two\ndimensional conducting sheets. On the other hand, there is no conduction enhancement at HH\ndomain walls at high forward bias, while there is a clear suppression of conduction at high\nreverse bias, which is qualitatively consistent with a recent theory [23]. The neutral domain walls\nseem to be more conductive than domains at high forward bias (Vtip<-7 V), which may originate\nfrom a slight reduction of band gap due to the suppression of polarization at domain walls [13].\nThe systematic bias dependence of domain wall conduction enhancement (suppression) is shown\nin the current maps in Fig. 4(c) to (f) with bias voltages at -10 V, -5 V, 5 V and 10 V,\nrespectively. Interestingly, both HH and TT domain walls are visible at reverse bias because of\ntheir antagonistic conduction behaviors.\nThe widths of HH domain walls (~120-250 nm) are larger than that of TT domain walls (~80100 nm), suggesting larger screening length at positively charged domain walls. This is\nconsistent with hole-type majority carriers because positively charged HH domain walls repel\nholes and generate a space charged region which increases the domain wall width [23]. Note that\nthe observed width of TT domain walls may be limited by the cAFM tip radius (\u226450 nm).\nTheoretically, the intrinsic width of charged 180o domain walls in proper ferroelectrics (e.g.\nPbTiO3) is determined by the non-linear screening length because of significant accumulation of\nfree charge carriers [22]. h-REMnO3 are improper ferroelectrics with very high Tc's (>1000 oC)\nand a sizable polarization (~5.5 \u03bcC/cm2) at room temperature [25, 34]. In comparison, PbTiO3\nhas lower Tc (~490 oC) but larger polarization (~75 \u03bcC/cm2) [17]. In addition, the ferroelectric\npolarization of h-REMnO3 couples linearly to the primary order (trimerization) when T is\nsufficient lower than Tc according to first principle studies [27], suggesting that the\nferroelectricity of h-REMnO3 is effectively a proper one at room temperature. Therefore, it is\nreasonable to assume that the intrinsic width of TT domain walls in h-HoMnO3 is comparable\nwith the theoretical value in PbTO3 (~2.7 nm) [23]. Future first principle and experimental\nstudies may clarify this issue.\nTransport of charge carriers confined at interfaces or surfaces is one of the major playgrounds in\ncondensed matter physics for emergent phenomena, examples of which include the quantum hall\neffect at GaAs/AlGaAs with modulation doping [35], tunable superconductivity at\nLaAlO3/SrTiO3 with charge catastrophe [36] and multiferroic tunneling junction at the\nBaTiO3/Fe interface [37]. However, many of these interfaces and surfaces suffer detrimental\nscattering of charge carriers from defects due to intrinsic imperfection in the fabrication process.\n6\n\n\fIt has been speculated that charged ferroelectric domain walls, if naturally formed, may provide\nan alternate route for creating atomically clean interface for trapping charge carriers [23]. Yet\nmost observed charged domain walls are metastable, often pinned by defects because they are\nenergetically unfavorable [16-19, 21]. In multiferroic h-REMnO3, charged ferroelectric domain\nwalls form naturally because of the presence of topological defects, vortices. Utilizing in situ\ncAFM, PFM and KPFM we have observed nanoscale conduction enhancement at topologicallyprotected TT 180o domain walls in h-HoMnO3. Our results suggest that this enhanced conduction\noriginates from hole-like charge carriers that have accumulated to screen the negative bound\ncharges. Our results demonstrate that topological defects can be harnessed to stabilize charged\n180o domain walls in multiferroics, which opens up opportunities for a new kind of nanoscale\nconduction channel in multifunctional devices. Charged ferroelectric domain walls may provide\nnovel platforms for creating correlated 2-dimensional electron gas without chemical doping.\nWe thank Mehmet Ramazanoglu for help crystal alignment with Lau\u00e9 x-ray scattering.

S1. Shear piezoelectric response of in-plane domains which determines the phase of the\nPFM signal at DC limit. The induced polarization causes rotation of total polarization, which in\nturn leads to the elongation of crystal along the diagonal direction, i.e. shear piezoelectric\nresponse.\n\nKelvin-Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) is also known as Scanning Surface potential\nMicroscopy, where a DC bias and an AC modulation with frequency (\u03c9) are applied to tip\nsimultaneously (Eq. (1)). The AC component of resultant electric force between tip and sample\nsurface provides a driving force at 1st and 2nd harmonic of the modulation (Eq. (2)), which cause\nthe cantilever to oscillate at these frequencies. The amplitude of the 1st harmonic term linearly\ndepends on the product of the AC modulation amplitude and the potential difference between tip\nand surface, as shown in Eq. (3). The DC component of electric force gradient causes the shift of\nresonant frequency which is a quadratic function of the potential difference, as shown in Eq. (4).\nVtip = VDC + VAC cos (\u03c9t )\n\nU=\n\n(1)\n\n2\n2\n1\n1\nC (Vtip \u2212 VS ) \u21d2 Fz = \u2212\u2202 zU = \u2212 \u2202 zC \u22c5 (Vtip \u2212 VS )\n2\n2\n\n1\n2\n2\ncos2 (\u03c9t )\u23a4\nFz = \u2212 \u2202 zC \u22c5 \u23a1 (VDC \u2212 VS ) + 2 (VDC \u2212 VS ) \u22c5 VAC cos (\u03c9t ) + VAC\n\u23a3\n\u23a6\n2\n\nThe cantilever oscillation amplitude of 1st harmonic:\n\nZ\u03c9 \u221d F\u03c9 \u221d (VDC \u2212 VS ) \u22c5 VAC\n\n(2)\n\n( 3)\n\n\fThe resonant frequency shift (\u0394f) caused by force gradient:\n\n\u0394f\n2\n\u221d \u2202 2z Fz \u221d (VDC \u2212 VS )\nf0\n\n(4)\n\nWe applied DC and AC bias (Vrms=5 V) to the conductive AFM tip in tapping mode. The 1st\nharmonic component was monitored with a lockin amplifier and the resonant frequency was\ntracked by a dedicated PLL. Eq. (3) and (4) are confirmed in our KPFM setup when ramping DC\nbias at a single spot, as shown in Fig. S2(d).\n\nFIG S2. (a) cAFM image taken at RT with Vtip=-3V, (b) PFM image and (c) KPFM image taken\nat 65 K at the same location as the cAFM image. The dark contrast of KPFM image corresponds\nto more negative surface potential. Color scales are 400 nA, 10 pm and 1 V for cAFM, PFM and\nKPFM images, respectively. (d) Bias dependence of KPFM signal and frequency shift measured\nsimultaneously at one spot of the sample surface with tapping mode. The red lines are fit\nfunctions according to theory in discussion.\n\nWe have carried out cAFM and PFM measurements with different conductive tips (Pt/Ir and Au)\nat different locations from the area show in main text. All the essential features were reproduced.\nOne example is shown in Fig. S2. The cAFM image was taken at room temperature with Vtip=3V. PFM and KPFM images were taken at 65 K. All images are taken at the same location. The\ndarker contrast in KPFM image corresponds to more negative surface potential. The potential\nresolution is relatively poor in our setup because we were using stiff cantilevers with spring\nconstant ~40 N/m for better PFM performance.\n\n\fFIG.
