We prove that linearizing certain families of polynomial optimization\nproblems leads to new functorial operations in real convex sets.

These operations are convex analogues of Hom functors, tensor products,\nsymmetric powers, exterior powers and general Schur functors on vector spaces and\nlead to novel constructions even for polyhedra.\n\n1. Introduction\nConvex polynomial optimization is concerned with the problem of determining the\nmaximum value of a real polynomial function f on a real convex set C. In the\nspecial case when the polynomial is linear and the convex set is an SDR set (i.e. a\nprojection of a spectrahedron) this problem can be solved numerically very efficiently,\nin polynomial time on the length of the description of C (see for instance [13]).\nIn this context it is natural to ask whether we can linearize arbitrary polynomial\noptimization problems, that is, whether we can construct a linear function F (f ) and\na convex domain F (C) with maxx\u2208C f (x) = maxy\u2208F (C) F (f )(y). The main result of\nthis article is to answer this question affirmatively for various classes of non-linear\nproblems. To do so we introduce several linearization functors on real convex sets\nwhich are the convex analogues of tensor and symmetric powers and more generally\nSchur functors on vector spaces. These operations give us a procedure to build the\nfunctions F (f ) as well as the new convex domains F (C).\nThe scope of this method depends on whether the sets F (C) admit descriptions\namenable to efficient computation. and one of the main results of this article is\nthe construction of arbitrarily accurate approximation schemes for the sets F (C) via\nprojections of spectrahedra.\nAs in the category of vector spaces the objects which linearize certain families of\nmaps are most clearly understood in terms of \"universal properties\". To this end\nwe introduce the categories of almost-compact cones and of marked cones. We show\nthat our linearization functors can be understood as solutions to universal problems\nin these categories. Our categorical point of view extends the approach pioneered\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 52A27 Secondary 90C25.\nKey words and phrases. Linearization functors, Spectrahedra, SDR sets.\n1\n\n\fby Ziegler [16, \u00a7 9.4] and Bogart, Contois, Gubeladze [5] from polyhedral cones to\ngeneral convex cones. In particular, our results extend the results of [5] on tensor\nproducts and Hom functors. In more detail, the contributions and organization of\nthis article can be summarized as follows:\n(1) In Section \u00a72 we introduce the categories of almost compact cones and of\nmarked cones. We define hom functors, tensor products and symmetric power\noperations in these categories. In Section \u00a77 we define, for each partition \u03bb a\nSchur functor S\u03bb in the category of marked cones.\n(2) In Section \u00a73 we show that the functors in the previous paragraph arise as\nsolutions of linearization problems (Theorem 3.3) and thus give us a new approach to several nonlinear polynomial optimization problems. We also study\nthe facial structure of the cones obtained by applying linearization functors\n(see Theorem 3.4). As an application we show in Example 3.6 that natural\nnonlinear extensions of the traveling salesman problem lead to families of new\npolytopes satisfying the universality property of Billera and Sarangarajan (i.e.\ncontain faces isomorphic to every {0, 1} polytope).\n(3) In Sections \u00a74 and \u00a75 we address the question of how to compute linearization\nfunctors. This is done in two ways:\n(a) In Section \u00a74 we introduce a general approximation scheme for polynomial\nimages of compact convex sets which support a measure via projections\nof spectrahedra. This scheme induces a hierarchy of relaxations which\nwe show converges to the desired set. Since all linearization functors are\npolynomial this method gives a way to approximate them, with arbitrary\nprecision, via projections of spectrahedra.\n(b) In Section \u00a75 we focus on computing linearization functors in the case\nof spectrahedral and SDR cones. The behavior of linearization functors\non morphisms allows us, in some cases, (see Theorem 5.2) to reduce this\ncomputation to that of linearization functors applied to the PSD cones\nS+ (V ) of positive semidefinite quadratic forms on the vector space V .\n(4) Finally in Section \u00a76 we study the convex geometry of the cones obtained\nby applying linearization functors to PSD cones. We show that the cones\nS+ (V )\u2297S+ (W ) and Hom(S+ (V ), S+ (W )) have various natural interpretations\nallowing us to prove that, in general, these sets are not spectrahedra (and the\nlatter are not even basic closed semialgebraic). In particular, this shows that\nthe subcategory of spectrahedral cones, unlike that of polyhedral cones, is not\nclosed under either tensor powers or Hom functors.\nTo conclude, we would like to propose the following open problem which stems naturally from the results in this article: Are the tensor powers, hom functors and\nsymmetric powers of SDR cones also SDR cones?\nPreliminaries. All vector spaces in this article are over the field of real numbers. If\nV is a vector space then a cone C in V is a subset C \u2286 V closed under nonnegative\n2\n\n\flinear combinations of its elements. A face F of a convex set C is a cone F \u2286 C\nsuch that if c1 + c2 \u2208 F for c1 , c2 \u2208 C then c1 , c2 \u2208 F . A face F is exposed if\nthere exists a linear functional \u03c6 \u2208 V \u2217 , called a witness for F , such that \u03c6(C) \u2265 0\nand F = C \u2229 ker(\u03c6). A convex cone is pointed if the origin is an exposed face and\nany witness \u03c6 for {0} is called a grading for C. A cone is closed if it is a closed\nsubset in the euclidean topology on V . By a convex body P in V we mean a fulldimensional compact convex set P \u2286 V . For preliminaries on convex sets including\nduality, polarity, and extreme points the reader should refer to [1]. For preliminaries\non spectrahedra and SDR sets the reader should refer to Section \u00a72.1 and to [4]. By a\nfunctor in a category we mean a functor from the category to itself. For preliminaries\non Schur functors on vector spaces the reader should refer to [8, Section 8.1].\nAcknowledgements.

Categories of real convex sets\nIn this article we study the behavior of functors from multilinear algebra on convex\nsets in vector spaces. We work in the following two categories:\nDefinition 1. Let AC denote the category of almost compact cones. Its objects\nare pairs (C, V ) where V is a finite-dimensional real vector space and C is a pointed,\nclosed and full-dimensional convex cone in V . We denote such a pair (C, V ) by its\nfirst component C and define LC := V . The morphisms between objects C1 and C2 ,\ndenoted HomAC (C1 , C2 ) are the linear maps f : LC1 \u2192 LC2 satisfying f (C1 ) \u2286 C2 .\nDefinition 2. Let MC denote the category of marked cones. Its objects are triples\n(C, g, s) where C \u2208 AC, g : C \u2192 R+ is a morphism and s : R+ \u2192 C is a section of\ng with s(1) \u2208 int(C). The morphisms between objects (C1 , g1 , s1 ) and (C2 , g2 , s2 ) are\nthe f \u2208 HomAC (C1 , C2 ) such that g2 \u25e6 f = g1 and f \u25e6 s1 = s2 . We will denote triples\n(C, g, s) by their first component C and denote g and s by gC and sC respectively.\nIf E is a real vector space and P \u2286 E is a convex body then the cone C1 =\nCone{(p, 1) : p \u2208 P } \u2286 E \u00d7 R is an almost compact cone and every such cone is\nthe cone over some compact base. If moreover P contains the origin in its interior\nthen C1 can be endowed with a grading g : C1 \u2192 R+ given by projection onto the\nlast component and with a section s(\u03b1) = \u03b1(0, 1) so that (C1 , g, s) is a marked cone.\nWe can recover P \u2286 E from (C, g, s) by letting E be the vector space obtained by\nmaking s(1) the origin of the affine space g \u22121 (1) \u2286 LC and letting P := g \u22121 (1) \u2229 C.\nIt is easy to see that via this construction\nLemma 2.1. The category of marked cones is equivalent to the category of fulldimensional compact convex sets with 0 in their interior and morphisms given by\nrestrictions of linear maps.\n3\n\n\fIf f \u2208 HomMC (C1 , C2 ) then f (C1 ) is a closed cone (since it is the cone over the\ncompact convex set f (g1\u22121 (1) \u2229 C1 ) which is contained in g2\u22121 (1) and thus does not\ncontain the origin). Closedness may fail for morphisms in AC as the following example\nshows:\nExample 2.2. Let P be the convex set in the plane defined by y \u2265 \u00b1x + x2 . Let\nC = Cone{(p, 1) : p \u2208 P } \u2286 R3 and let D \u2286 R2 be the cone generated by (\u00b11, 1). If\n\u03c0 : C \u2192 D is the projection onto the first two components then the set \u03c0(C) is the\ninterior of D together with the origin and in particular is not a closed cone.\nThe following definitions induce a duality functor and define categorical products\nin AC and MC.\nDefinition 3. If C \u2208 AC then its dual C \u2217 \u2286 LC \u2217 \u2208 AC. If f \u2208 HomAC (C1 , C2 ) then\nthe transpose f \u2217 : LC2\u2217 \u2192 LC1\u2217 maps C2\u2217 to C1\u2217 . If (C, g, s) \u2208 MC then (C \u2217 , s\u2217 , g \u2217 ) \u2208\nMC. If C1 , C2 \u2208 AC then the cartesian product C1 \u00d7 C2 \u2286 LC1 \u00d7 LC2 \u2208 AC and\n2 (c2 )\nif (Ci , gi , si ) \u2208 MC for i \u2208 {1, 2} then letting g(c1 , c2 ) := g1 (c1 )+g\nwe see that\n2\n(C1 \u00d7 C2 , g, s1 \u00d7 s2 ) \u2208 MC.\nRemark 2.3. Via the equivalence in Lemma 2.1 the duality above recovers the concept\nof the polar P \u25e6 of a convex set. The resulting product of two compact convex sets P1 \u2286\nE1 and P2 \u2286 E2 is the subset P \u2286 E1 \u00d7E2 \u00d7R given by P = Conv((P1 , 0, 0), (0, P2 , 1)).\n2.1. Subcategories of convex sets. The following distinguished kinds of convex\nsets play an important role in this paper,\nDefinition 4. For a real vector space W the PSD cone S+ (W ) is the set of sums of\nsquares in Sym2 (W ). The pairs (S+ (W ), Sym2 (W )) are AC cones. A cone (C, LC) \u2208\nAC is a spectrahedral cone if there exists a real vector space W and an injective linear\nmap \u03c8 : LC \u2192 Sym2 (W \u2217 ) such that C = \u03c8 \u22121 (S+ (W \u2217 )). A cone (D, LD) \u2208 AC is an\nSDR (semidefinitely representable) cone if there exist a spectrahedral cone C and a\nsurjective morphism \u03c0 : C \u2192 D. A cone in MC is spectrahedral or SDR if all objects\nand morphisms from the previous paragraph are in MC.\n\u223c\nDefinition 5. Let E P\n= Rn be a real vector space. A spectrahedron in E is a set of\nthe form {x \u2208 E : A+ ni=1 xi Bi \u0017 0} for some symmetric\nmatrices A, B1 , . . . Bn . An\n\u0010\n\u0011\nPn\nP\n0\nSDR set in E is a set of the form {x \u2208 E : \u2203y \u2208 E A + i=1 xi Bi + kj=1 yj Cj \u0017 0 }\nfor some real vector space E 0 \u223c\n= Rk and some symmetric matrices A, B1 , . . . Bn , C1 , . . . Ck .\nVia Lemma 2.1 compact spectrahedral (resp. SDR) sets in E determine marked\nspectrahedral (resp. SDR) cones in E \u00d7 R. Conversely if C is a spectrahedral (resp.\nSDR) cone in MC then the sets C \u2229 gC\u22121 (1) are spectrahedral (resp. SDR) sets. Spectrahedra and SDR sets play an important role in optimization because the problem\nof optimizing a linear functional over a spectrahedron (and thus over an SDR set)\ncan be solved in polynomial time on the length of its description (see [13] for precise\nstatements).\n4\n\n\f3. Functors on real convex sets.\nIn this section we define several linearization operations on convex sets. Our main\ncontribution is to interpret them as solutions to universal problems and to study their\nfacial structure.\nDefinition 6. If C1 , C2 \u2208 AC then HomAC (C1 , C2 ) is a cone in the real vector space\nHom(LC1 , LC2 ). Define C1 \u2297 C2 := Cone{c1 \u2297 c2 : ci \u2208 Ci } \u2286 LC1 \u2297 LC2 and for\nany integer p > 0 define Symp (C1 ) = {v1 . . . vp : vi \u2208 C1 } \u2286 Symp (LC1 ).\nTheorem 3.1. If C1 , C2 \u2208 AC (resp. \u2208 MC) and p > 0 is an integer then the\nfollowing statements hold:\n(1) The cones HomAC (C1 , C2 ), C1 \u2297 C2 and Symp (C1 ) are in AC (resp. in MC).\n(2) Defining the action on morphisms as in the category of vector spaces then\nHomAC (C1 , \u2212), HomAC (\u2212, C2 ), C1 \u2297\u2212 and Symp (\u2212) are functors in AC (resp.\nMC).\nProof. (1.) Since every cone in AC can be endowed (non-canonically) with a grading\nand a section it is sufficient to show that the above operations applied to cones\nin MC lead to cones in MC. Thus\n(Ci , gi , si ) \u2208 MC for i = 1, 2. Since\nT assume\nT\nC2 is closed, HomAC (C1 , C2 ) = c\u2208C1 \u03bb\u2208C \u2217 {f : \u03bb(f (c)) \u2265 0} and thus it is an\n2\nintersection of closed sets and hence closed. Since s2 (1) is in the interior of C2 ,\nthe cone HomAC (C1 , C2 ) contains the element s2 \u25e6 g1 : C1 \u2192 C2 as well as any\nhomomorphism f + s2 \u25e6 g1 for f in a sufficiently small ball around the origin in\nHom(LC1 , LC2 ) and thus HomAC (C1 , C2 ) is full-dimensional. Finally the function h\nsending f \u2208 Hom(LC1 , LC2 ) to g2 (f (s1 (1))) defines a grading since h(f ) = 0 implies\nthat f (s1 (1)) = 0 and thus f maps an interior point of C1 to 0 forcing f to be the\n0 map. Thus (HomAC (C1 , C2 ), h, s2 \u25e6 g1 ) \u2208 MC. For the tensor product note that\nC1 \u2229 g1\u22121 (1) \u00d7 C2 \u2229 g2\u22121 (1) \u2192 C1 \u2229 g1\u22121 (1) \u2297 C2 \u2229 g2\u22121 (1) is a continuous surjection\nand thus the right hand side is compact and does not contain the origin. It follows\nthat the cone over it, which is C1 \u2297 C2 is closed. It is full-dimensional since the\npairwise tensor products of bases for LC1 and LC2 contained in C1 and C2 resp. are\na basis for LC1 \u2297 LC2 contained in C1 \u2297 C2 . P\nSimilarly s1 (1) \u2297 s2 (1) is an interior\npoint of C1 \u2297 C2 . Now let \u03b2 \u2208 C1 \u2297 C2 so \u03b2 =\ncj1 \u2297 cj2 with cji \u2208 C1 and note that\nP\nj\nj\n(g1 \u2297 g2 )(\u03b2) =\ng1 (c1 ) \u2297 g2 (c2 ) = 0 iff for every summand either cj1 or cj2 are zero\nand thus iff \u03b2 = 0. As a result the function g1 \u2297 g2 is a grading of the tensor product.\nIt follows that (C1 \u2297 C2 , g1 \u2297 g2 , s1 \u2297 s2 ) \u2208 MC. Here we implicitly used the fact\nthat the multiplication map gives a canonical isomorphism between R \u2297 R and R.\nFor the symmetric powers define the function Symp (g1 )(v1 . . . vp ) = g1 (v1 ) . . . g1 (vp ) \u2208\nSymp (R) \u223c\n= R and extend linearly. It is immediate that Symp (g1 ) is a grading on\nSymp (C1 ). The multiplication map \u03bc : C1\u2297p \u2192 Symp (C1 ) mapping v1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 vp \u2192\nv1 . . . vp is a surjective\nlinear map whose image is the cone over the compact set\n\u0001\n\u22121\n\u2297p\n\u03bc (C1 \u2229 g1 (1))\nwhich is contained in Symp (g1 )\u22121 (1) and thus does not contain\n5\n\n\fthe origin. It follows that Symp (C1 ) is a closed and full-dimensional cone. It follows\nthat (Symp (C1 ), Symp (g1 ), Symp (s1 )) \u2208 MC. Here we have implicitly used the fact\nthat Symp (R) is canonically isomorphic to R via the multiplication. (2.) Define the\noperations on objects as in part (1.). Since HomAC (C1 , C2 ) \u2286 Hom(LC1 , LC2 ) then\nwe can define the action of HomAC (C1 , \u2212), HomAC (\u2212, C2 ), C1 \u2297 \u2212 and Symp (\u2212) on\nmorphisms as that of the corresponding functors on vector spaces and this definition\nwill respect compositions. It follows that the above operations are functors in AC. For\nfunctoriality in MC we need to verify that the images of morphisms in MC are also\nin MC (i.e. commute with the grading and the section of the corresponding objects).\nWe verify the case of HomAC (D, \u2212) and leave the remaining similar verifications\nto the reader. Thus assume f \u2208 HomMC (A, C) and we wish to verify that f\u02c6 :\nHomAC (D, A) \u2192 HomAC (D, C) is a morphism of marked cones. This amounts to\nshowing that the equalities gC \u25e6 f \u25e6 h \u25e6 sD (1) = gA \u25e6 h \u25e6 sD (1) and f \u25e6 sA \u25e6 gD = sC \u25e6 gD\nhold for every h \u2208 HomAC (D, A). This is an immediate consequence of the fact that\nf \u2208 HomMC (A, C).\n\u0003\nRemark 3.2. Via the equivalence in Lemma 2.1 the above functors define operations\non convex bodies containing the origin in their interior. Concretely, for convex bodies\nPi \u2286 Ei we have P1 \u2297P2 := Conv{(p1 , p2 , p1 \u2297p2 ) : pi \u2208 Pi } \u2286 E1 \u00d7E2 \u00d7(E1 \u2297E2 ). For\nan integer n > 0 and 0 \u2264 j \u2264 n let ej (x1 , . . . , xn ) be the j-th elementary symmetric\npolynomial in\nWe have Symn (P1 ) := Conv{(e1 (p1 , . . . , pn ), . . . , en (p1 , . . . , pn )) :\nQnn variables.\npi \u2208 P1 } \u2286 j=1 Symj (E1 ).\nNext we show that tensor powers and symmetric products are solutions to universal\nlinearization problems.\nDefinition\n7.

Note that T is uniquely determined by its restriction\nto\nCi . A multilinear T is symmetric if for every permutation \u03c3 \u2208 Sn and every\nvi \u2208 Ci we have T (v\u03c3(1) , . . . , v\u03c3(n) ) = T (v1 , . . . , vn ).\nTheorem 3.3. Let n > 0 be an integer.\n(1) The following universal linearization properties\nhold,\nQ\n(a) Assume C1 , . . . , Cn \u2208 AC and let u : Ci \u2192 \u2297Ci be the map u(v\nQ1 , . . . , vn ) =\nv1 \u2297* * *\u2297vn .

For every\nD \u2208 AC and every multilinear symmetric map T : C1n \u2192 D there is a\nunique t \u2208 HomAC (Symn (C1 ), D) such that T = t \u25e6 q.\n(2) For every A, B, C \u2208 AC, tensor products and homs satisfy the following adjunction formula HomAC (A \u2297 B, C) \u223c\n= HomAC (A, HomAC (B, C)).\nProof. (1a.) By the universal property of tensor products\nN in the category of vector\nspaces every such T determines a unique linear map t :\nLCi \u2192 LD with T = t \u25e6 h\n6\n\n\fN\nthus every generator v1 \u2297* * *\u2297vn of the cone\nCi , and hence the cone itself is mapped\nN\nvia t to D.\nConversely\na\nmorphism\nt\n:\nC\n\u2192\nD is the restrictionQ\nof a unique linear\ni\nN\nmap t :\nLCi \u2192NLW and thus defines a multilinear\nmap T :\nLCi \u2192 LD via\nQ\nT = t \u25e6 h. Since t( Ci ) \u2286 D it follows that T ( Ci ) \u2286 D as claimed. (1b.) Follows\nby a similar argument from the universal property of symmetric powers in the category\nof vector spaces. (2.) Follows from part ( 1a.) since HomAC (A, HomAC (B, C)) is the\nset of bilinear maps from A \u00d7 B to C.\n\u0003\nThe following Theorem describes some basic properties of the facial structure of\nthe cones obtained by applying linearization functors,\nTheorem 3.4. Let A, B \u2208 AC and n > 0 an integer. The following statements hold:\n(1) The extreme rays of A \u2297 B are precisely the tensor products of extreme rays\nof A and B. If FA and FB are faces (resp.exposed faces) of A and B then\nFA \u2297 FB is a face (resp. an exposed face) of A \u2297 B.\n(2) The extreme rays of Symn (A) are products of extreme rays of A. If F1 , . . . , Fn\nare exposed face of A then F1 * * * Fn := Cone(p1 * * * pn : pi \u2208 Fi ) is an exposed\nface of Symn (A).\n(3) The maximal exposed faces of HomAC (A, B) are in canonical correspondence\nwith the exposed extreme rays of A \u2297 B \u2217 .\nProof. (1.) By the Krein-Milman Theorem the cones A and B are generated by\ntheir extreme rays. As a result A \u2297 B is generated by the tensor powers of extreme\nrays and thus every extreme ray of A \u2297 B is of this form. Let PA := A \u2229 gA\u22121 (1) and\nPB := B \u2229 gA\u22121 (1) and recall that the convex set PA \u2297 PB = Conv{(pA , pB , pA \u2297 pB , 1) :\npA \u2208 PA , pB \u2208 PB } is precisely A\u2297B \u2229(ga \u2297gB )\u22121 (1) and in particular there is a correspondence between the faces of PA \u2297PB and the nonempty faces of A\u2297B. Now suppose\nFA and FB are faces of A and B inducing faces GA and GB of PA and PB . We want to\nshow that the convex set GA \u2297 GB := Conv{(pAP\n, pB , pA \u2297 pB , 1) : pA \u2208 GA , pB \u2208 GB }\nis\nPa face of PA \u2297 PBP. If ai \u2208 PA and bi \u2208 PB and \u03bbi (ai , bi , ai \u2297 bi , 1) \u2208 GA \u2297 GB then\n\u03bbi ai \u2208 GA and \u03bbi bi \u2208 GB and thus, since GA and GB are faces of PA and PB , we\nhave that ai \u2208 GA and bi \u2208 GB . It follows that (ai , bi , ai \u2297 bi , 1) \u2208 GA \u2297 GB . In particular the tensor products of extreme rays of A and B are extreme rays of A \u2297 B. If \u03c6A\nand \u03c6B are supporting linear functions for FA and FB then \u03c6A \u2297gB +gA \u2297\u03c6B is a linear\nfunctional supporting the face FA \u2297 FB . (2.) By the Krein-Milman Theorem the cone\nA is generated by its extreme rays and thus Symn (A) is generated by the products of\nextreme rays of A and in particular every extreme ray of Symn (A) must be a product\nof extreme rays of A. If \u03c6i is a linear functional supporting the face Fi then the\nlinear function associated\nto the symmetric multilinear map \u03c8 : LV n \u2192 R given by\nPn\n\u03c8(v1 , . . . , vn ) :=\ni=1 gA (v1 ) . . . gA (vi\u22121 )\u03c6i (vi )gA (vi+1 ) . . . gA (vn ) supports F1 * * * Fn .\n(3.) By Lemma 3.3 part (2.) we have HomAC (A, B) = HomAC (A, HomAC (B \u2217 , R)) =\n7\n\n\fHomAC (A \u2297 B \u2217 , R). The result now follows from the well known correspondence between the maximal proper exposed faces of a convex cone and the exposed rays of its\ndual.\n\u0003\nExample 3.5. Let P = [\u22121, 1] \u2286 R. The set P \u2297 P is the simplex shown in Figure 1.\nThe only proper nonempty faces of P \u2297 P which are tensor powers of faces of P\nare the vertices and the edges drawn in bold in the figure. If n > 0 is an integer\nthen Symn (P ) is the simplex in Rn whose vertices are obtained as the coefficients of\nthe positive powers of x in the polynomial (x + 1)m (1 \u2212 x)n\u2212m for 0 \u2264 m \u2264 n. In\nparticular Sym2 (P ) is the triangle shown in Figure 1. The only proper nonempty\nfaces of Sym2 (P ) which can be obtained as\u0001 products of faces of P are the vertices and\nbold edges. More generally there are n+2\nproduct faces among the 2n \u2212 1 nonempty\n2\nfaces of Symn (P ). As an illustration of Lemma 3.3 note that for ai \u2208 R we have\n(1, 2)\ny\nz\n\ny (1, 1, 1)\n\n(\u22121, 1, \u22121)\n\n(\u22121, 0)\nx\n\n(\u22121, \u22121, 1)\n\nx\n\n(1, \u22121, \u22121)\n\n(1, \u22122)\n\nFigure 1. P \u2297 P and Sym2 (P ) for P = [\u22121, 1].\nmax\n\n(x1 ,x2 )\u2208P \u00d7P\n\na1 x 1 x 2 + a2 x 1 + a3 x 2 + a4 =\n\nmax\n\n(x,y,z)\u2208P \u2297P\n\na1 x + a2 y + a3 z + a4 .\n\nIt is thus possible to linearize certain nonlinear optimization problems via tensor\nproducts. In exchange the domain of the problem has been modified and thus the\nusefulness of this approach is limited by whether or not we have a description of the\ntensor product amenable to efficient computation. We address these questions in the\nfollowing section.\nExample 3.6. Consider the following natural extensions of the symmetric traveling\nsalesman problem,\n(1) Two-tier TSP: A company has two kinds of traveling salesmen who wish\nto visit n cities. The travelers have different costs of traveling cij = cji and\ndij = dji between cities i and j. Moreover, the airline gives the company\na discount \u2212uij whenever both salesmen choose to take a trip between cities\n8\n\n\fi and j. The company wishes to find itineraries for both travelers so as to\nminimize the total cost.\n(2) Roman army TSP: The roman army has m identical legions patrolling n\ncities with identical traveling cost cij = cji between cities i and j. The emperor\nwants the legions to go over as many of the roman roads as possible. Thus\ntwo or more legions traveling along the same road have a penalty prij whenever\nr > 0 legions choose to use the road joining i, j. Find routes for all legions so\nas to minimize total cost.\nLet ST SP (n) be the symmetric traveling salesman polytope (i.e. the convex hull of\nthe adjacency matrices of all Hamiltonian cycles in the complete graph). Choose\ncoordinates for the span of ST SP (n) with center on the average of its vertices and\nobtain a convex body which we also denote as ST SP (n). By Lemma 3.3 the two\nproblems above can be linearized on the polytopes 2T SP (n) := ST SP (n) \u2297 ST SP (n)\nand RT SP (m, n) := Symm (ST SP (n)).\nThe polytopes in the previous example satisfy a remarkable universality property,\nTheorem 3.7. Fix m > 1. If P \u2286 Rd is a {0, 1}-polytope (i.e. all the components of\nits vertices are in {0, 1}) then there is an integer N (d) > 0 such that P is isomorphic\nto a face of 2ST SP (n) and of RT SP (m, n).\nProof. By a result of Billera and Sarangarajan [3, Theorem 3.1] P is isomorphic to\na face of the asymmetric traveling salesman polytope AST P (N ) for some N . By a\nresult of Karp [14] the AST P (N ) appears as a face of ST SP (2N ) and by Theorem 3.4\nST SP (2N ) appears as a face of 2ST SP (2N ) (resp. RT SP (m, 2N )) by taking the\ntensor product (resp. the product) of ST SP (2N ) and any vertex (resp. and the\n(m \u2212 1)-st power of any vertex).\n\u0003\n\n4. Approximating convex hulls of polynomial images in the presence\nof a measure.\nWith the purpose of computing linearization functors we introduce an approximation scheme for convex hulls of polynomial images of compact sets via projections of\nspectrahedra of interest in its own right. Let B \u2286 Rn be a compact set, let m be a\nfinite measure supported on B (i.e. every open neighborhood of every point of B has\npositive m measure) and let T : Rn \u2192 Rm be a polynomial map with components\nTi (x1 , . . . , xn ), 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m. The following approximation method for the convex hull\nof T (B) is an extension of the ideas of Barvinok and Veomett [2] on semidefinite\napproximations of convex sets.\n9\n\n\fDefinition 8. For \u03bb \u2208 Rm and k \u2265 0 define the symmetric bilinear form \u03c6k\u03bb on the\nvector space of polynomials of degree at most k in Rn by\n!\nZ\nm\nX\n1+\n\u03c6k\u03bb (a(x), b(x)) :=\n\u03bbi Ti (x) a(x)b(x)dm(x).\nB\n\ni=1\n\nLemma 4.1. Define Qk := {\u03bb \u2208 Rm : \u03c6k\u03bb \u0017 0}. The following statements hold:\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n\nFor every k, Qk+1 \u2286 Qk , the set Qk is a spectrahedron and Q\u25e6k is an SDR set.\nConv(T (B))\u25e6 \u2286 T\nQk for every k.\nConv(T (B))\u25e6 = \u221e\nQ .\nS k=1\u25e6 k\nConv(T (B)) = k (Qk ).\nIf B is a finite set and m the counting measure on B then Conv(T (B)) = Q\u25e6k\nfor some k.\n\nProof. (1.) The inclusion occurs because a polynomial of degree at most k also has\ndegree at most k + 1. The set Qk is a spectrahedron because the function \u03c6k\u03bb is\naffine linear in \u03bb. By [9, Proposition 3.2], Q\u25e6k is the projection of a spectrahedron.\n(2.) An affine linear function is nonnegative on a set S iff itPis nonnegative in its\nconvex hull. As a result Conv(T (B))\u25e6 = {\u03bb \u2208 Rm : \u2200x \u2208 B ( i \u03bbi Ti (x) \u2265 \u22121)}. If\n\u25e6\n\u03bb \u2208 Conv(T\n, k \u2208 N and a(x) is any polynomial of degree at most k then the\nR (B)) P\n2\nfunction\nquantity B (1 + m\ni=1 \u03bbi Ti (x)) a (x)dm(x) is the integral of a nonnegative\nT\u221e\nQ\non B and thus\nnonnegative.\nHence\n\u03bb\n\u2208\nQ\n.\n(3.)\nSuppose\n\u03bb\n\u2208\nk\nk=1 k and let\nP\n\u25e6\n\u2217\n\u03b4(x) := 1 +\n\u03bbi Ti (x). If \u03bb 6\u2208 Conv(T (B)) then there exists x \u2208 B such that\n\u03b4(x\u2217 ) < 0. By continuity of \u03b4 there exists radii 0 < r1 < r2 and balls Bri (x\u2217 ) such\nthat \u03b4(x) < 0 in Br2 (x\u2217 ) \u2229 B. Let h(x) be a continuous function such that h(x) = 1\nin Br1 (x) and h(x) = 0 outside Br2 (x\u2217 ). By the Stone-Weierstrass theorem there is\na sequence of polynomials sn (x) converging uniformly to h(x) in B and by finiteness\nof m and the dominated convergence theorem\nZ\nZ\n2\nlim\n\u03b4(x)sn (x) dm =\n\u03b4(x)h(x)2 dm < 0\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nB\n\nB\n\nit follows that for some sufficiently large N the integral\ndeg(s2N )\n\nR\nB\n\n\u03b4(x)sN (x)2 dm < 0 con-\n\ntraddicting the fact that \u03c6\u03bb\nis positive semidefinite. (4.) By part (3.) we have\nthe equalities\n!\u25e6\n\u221e\n\u221e\n\u221e\n[\n\\\n\\\n\u25e6 \u25e6\n\u25e6\n=\n(Qk ) =\nQk = Conv(T (B))\u25e6\nQk\nk=1\n\nk=1\n\nk=1\n\nTaking polars and using the fact that Conv(T (B)) is closed we obtain the claimed\nequality. (5.) Let B = {b1 , . . . , bs }. Since B is finite the affine coordinate ring R[B]\nis a product of fields and thus there exist interpolation\nP polynomials kpi (x) such that\npi (bj ) = \u03b4ij of degree at most k. If \u03bb \u2208 Qk then 1 + \u03bbi Ti (bj ) = \u03c6\u03bb (pj , pj ) \u2265 0 for\n1 \u2264 j \u2264 s so \u03bb \u2208 Conv(T (B))\u25e6 and the claim follows by polarity.\n\u0003\n10\n\n\fRemark 4.2. By Lemma 4.1 part (4) we call the above construction an accurate\napproximation scheme for Conv(T (B)) via SDR sets. Note that if B is a convex body\nthen the restriction of the Lebesgue measure to B satisfies the necessary hypothesis\nfor the above approximation scheme.\nRemark 4.3. Via positivstellensatz-type results it is possible to obtain approximations of Conv(T (B)) from above for some compact sets B (for instance basic closed\nsemialgebraic). However, this approach has two drawbacks. First, it does not apply\nto arbitrary convex bodies B and second, when the corresponding quadratic module is\nnot finitely generated it is not clear how to write the resulting approximating convex\nbodies as projections of spectrahedra. Because of these two reasons we find the above\napproximation scheme preferable. A case of much interest when the corresponding\nquadratic module is not finitely generated is for instance the positivestellensatz for\nprojections of spectrahedra of Gouveia and Netzer [9, Theorem 5.1].\nAs an application of Lemma 4.1 we obtain accurate approximation schemes for\nlinearization functors.\nTheorem 4.4. Let A, B \u2208 MC and n > 0 an integer and let PA := A \u2229 gA\u22121 (1) and\nPB := B \u2229 gB\u22121 (1).\n(1) Assume mA , mB , mB \u25e6 are finite measures supported in PA , PB and PB \u25e6 . These\nmeasures determine accurate approximation schemes for A \u2297 B, Symn (A) and\nHomAC (A, B) by SDR sets.\n(2) If A and B are polyhedra and mA , mB and mB \u25e6 are the counting measures on\nthe vertices of PA , PB and PB \u25e6 respectively then the approximation schemes\nconverge after finitely many steps and we obtain projected spectrahedral representations of the polyhedra A \u2297 B, Symn (A) and HomAC (A, B).\nProof. Let EA , EB be the vector space structures on gA\u22121 (1) and gB\u22121 (1) obtained by\nplacing the origin in sA (1) and sB (1) respectively. Let T : EA \u00d7 EB \u2192 EA \u00d7 EB \u00d7\n(EA \u2297 EB ) be the map sending (a, b) \u2192 (a, b, a \u2297 b) and note that this is a polynomial\nmap satisfying PA \u2297 PB = Conv(T (PA \u00d7 PB )). Since mA \u00d7 mB is a finite measure\non the compact set PA \u00d7 PB the Lemma 4.1 gives us an accurate approximation\nscheme for the tensor product via SDR sets. The corresponding MCLcones approximate the tensor product A \u2297 B as claimed. Similarly Symn (PA ) \u2286 nj=1 Symj (EA )\nis the convex hull of the image of PAn under the polynomial map T (p1 , . . . , pn ) =\n(en (p1 , . . . , pn ), . . . , e1 (p1 , . . . , pn )) where the ei the elementary symmetric polynomials in n variables. The product measure mnA supported on PAn allows us, via Lemma 4.1\nto construct an accurate approximation scheme for symmetric powers via SDR sets.\nThe corresponding MC cones approximate Symn (A) as claimed. Now, by Theorem 3.3 part (2.) we know HomAC (A, B) = (A \u2297 B \u2217 )\u2217 and the statement follows form\nthe accurate approximation scheme for tensor products from the first paragraph. In\nparticular we can write HomAC (A, B) as a countable intersection of spectrahedra.\nBy Theorem 3.4 the vertices of the polytopes PA \u2297 PB and Symn (PA ) are precisely\n11\n\n\fproducts of vertices. It follows that these convex sets are the convex hulls under polynomial maps of finite sets and the conclusion follows by Lemma 4.1 part (5.). Since\nHomAC (A, B) = (A \u2297 B \u2217 )\u2217 the accurate approximation scheme for A \u2297 B \u2217 allows us\nto give a spectrahedral description of HomAC (A, B).\n\u0003\n5. Computing linearization functors\nNext we study how our operations behave under morphisms. As a result we obtain\nexact computations for tensor powers, symmetric powers and Homs of SDR cones.\nDefinition 9. Let f \u2208 HomAC (C, D). The morphism is strongly injective if the linear\nfunction f : LC \u2192 LD is injective and satisfies f \u22121 (D) = C. We denote strongly\ninjective morphisms as f : C ,\u2192 D.The morphism has dense image if f (C) = D. We\ndenote it by f : C \u0010 D.\nRecall that for cones in AC there are morphisms with non-closed image while in\nMC a morphism with dense image is surjective (see Section 2). Strongly injective\nmorphisms and morphisms with dense image are closely related via duality,\nLemma 5.1. f : C ,\u2192 D if and only if f \u2217 : D\u2217 \u0010 C \u2217 .\nProof. Assume f : C ,\u2192 D and let h be a linear functional nonnegative in f \u2217 (D\u2217 ). We\nwill show that h must be nonnegative in C \u2217 and conclude that f \u2217 (D\u2217 ) = C \u2217 . Via the\ncanonical identification between ((LC)\u2217 )\u2217 and LC we can assume that h : (LC)\u2217 \u2192 R\nis evaluation at a point p \u2208 LC. By our assumption for every g \u2208 D\u2217 g(f (p)) \u2265 0\nand thus f (p) \u2208 D. Since f is strongly injective this implies that p \u2208 D and thus h\nis nonnegative in C \u2217 as claimed. For the converse we will show that if f : C \u0010 D\nthen f \u2217 : D\u2217 ,\u2192 C \u2217 and conclude that the claim holds by bi-duality. Suppose that\nh \u2208 (LD)\u2217 and that f \u2217 : (LD)\u2217 \u2192 (LC)\u2217 maps h to C \u2217 . It follows that for every\nc \u2208 C h(f (c)) \u2265 0 and since f (C) is dense in D that h \u2208 D\u2217 so f \u2217 is strongly injective\nas claimed.\n\u0003\nIf f \u2208 HomAC (C, D) and A1 \u2208 AC then we denote by f\u02c6 : HomAC (A1 , C) \u2192\nHomAC (A1 , D) the morphism obtained by composition with f . Using this notation\nwe have,\nTheorem 5.2. For i = 1, 2 let Ai , Bi and C be cones in AC and let n > 0 be an\ninteger. The following statements hold:\n(1) If f : A1 \u0010 B1 then Symn (f ) : Symn (A1 ) \u0010 Symn (B1 ), f \u2217 : HomAC (B1 , C) ,\u2192\nHomAC (A1 , C) and f\u02c6\u2217 : HomAC (C, B1\u2217 ) ,\u2192 HomAC (C, A\u22171 ). If moreover g :\nA2 \u0010 B2 then f \u2297 g : A1 \u2297 A2 \u0010 B1 \u2297 B2 .\n(2) If h : A1 ,\u2192 B1 then \u0125 : HomAC (C, A1 ) ,\u2192 HomAC (C, B1 ), h\u2217\u2217 : HomAC (A\u22171 , C) ,\u2192\nHomAC (B1\u2217 , C), Symn (h) : Symn (A\u22171 )\u2217 ,\u2192 Symn (B1\u2217 )\u2217 and we have inclusions\nSymn (A1 ) \u2286 Symn (h)\u22121 (Symn (B1 )) \u2286 Symn (A\u22171 )\u2217 . If moreover t : A2 ,\u2192 B2\n12\n\n\fthen h \u2297 t : (A\u22171 \u2297 A\u22172 )\u2217 ,\u2192 (B1\u2217 \u2297 B2\u2217 )\u2217 and we have inclusions A1 \u2297 A2 \u2286\n(h \u2297 t)\u22121 (B1 \u2297 B2 ) \u2286 (A\u22171 \u2297 A\u22172 )\u2217 .\nProof. (1.) If Ai \u0010 Bi then Symn (A1 ) \u0010 Symn (B1 ) and A1 \u2297 A2 \u0010 B1 \u2297 B2\nbecause by our assumption the images of the generators of the domain are dense in\nthe generators of the codomain. If f : A1 \u0010 B1 and g \u2208 Hom(LB1 , LC) satisfies\nf \u2217 (g) \u2208 HomAC (A1 , C) then for every a \u2208 A1 we have g(f (a)) \u2208 C. Since f (A1 ) is\ndense in B1 it follows that g(y) \u2208 C for y \u2208 B1 so g \u2208 HomAC (B1 , C) and thus f \u2217\nis strongly injective as claimed. Finally, by Lemma 5.1 we have f \u2217 : B1\u2217 ,\u2192 C1\u2217 and\nusing the first claim of part (2.) to be shown next we conclude f\u02c6\u2217 : HomAC (C, B1\u2217 ) ,\u2192\nHomAC (C, A\u22171 ). (2.) Assume h : A1 ,\u2192 B1 and suppose g \u2208 Hom(LC, LA1 ) is such\nthat \u0125(g) \u2208 HomAC (C, B1 ). It follows that for every c \u2208 C h(g(c)) \u2208 B1 so g(c) \u2208 B1\nsince h is strongly injective so g \u2208 HomAC (C, A1 ) as claimed. By Lemma 5.1 we have\nh\u2217 : B1\u2217 \u0010 A\u22171 and by part (1) that h\u2217\u2217 : HomAC (A\u22171 , C) ,\u2192 HomAC (B1\u2217 , C). Again\nby part (1.) our hypothesis on h yields Symn (h\u2217 ) : Symn (B1\u2217 ) \u0010 Symn (A\u22171 ) and\nby Lemma 5.1 Symn (h) : Symn (A\u22171 )\u2217 ,\u2192 Symn (B1\u2217 )\u2217 . By Lemma 5.1 and part (1.)\nwe have h\u2217 \u2297 t\u2217 : B1\u2217 \u2297 B2\u2217 \u0010 A\u22171 \u2297 A\u22172 and applying Lemma 5.1 again we conclude\n\u0003\nh \u2297 t : (A\u22171 \u2297 A\u22172 )\u2217 ,\u2192 (B1\u2217 \u2297 B2\u2217 )\u2217 . The claimed inclusions are immediate.\nThe most interesting feature of the previous Theorem is the behavior of tensor\nproducts and symmetric powers under strongly injective maps in part (2). The inclusions in the Theorem suggest a sort of failure of \"left exactness\" of tensors and\nsymmetric powers which makes them difficult to compute. The following example\nshows that the inclusions may be strict even for polyhedra.\nExample 5.3. Denote Rn with canonical basis a1 , . . . , an with the symbol Rna and let\na01 , . . . , a0n be its dual basis. Let Cx := Cone(\u00b1x1 \u00b1x2 +x3 ) \u2286 R3x and let \u03c6x : Cx ,\u2192 R4+ .\nWe know that Cx \u2297 Cy \u2286 (\u03c6x \u2297 \u03c6y )\u22121 (R4+ \u2297 R4+ ) = (Cx\u2217 \u2297 Cy\u2217 )\u2217 and we will show that\nthe inclusion is strict.\nBy Theorem 5.2 part (2.) we know \u03c6x \u2297 \u03c6y : (Cx\u2217 \u2297 Cy\u2217 )\u2217 ,\u2192 ((R4+ )\u2217 \u2297 (R4+ )\u2217 )\u2217 \u2286\nR4z \u2297 R4w .

We will show that \u03b2 6\u2208 Cx \u2297 Cy .\nTo this end let \u03b3 := x01 \u2297 y10 \u2212 x01 \u2297 y20 \u2212 x02 \u2297 y10 \u2212 x02 \u2297 y20 + 2x03 \u2297 y30 and note that\n\u03b3((\u000f1 x1 + \u000f2 x2 + x3 ) \u2297 (\u03b41 y1 + \u03b42 y2 + y3 )) = \u000f1 \u03b41 \u2212 \u000f1 \u03b42 \u2212 \u000f2 \u03b41 \u2212 \u000f2 \u03b42 + 2 which cannot\n13\n\n\fbe negative for \u000fi , \u03b4i \u2208 {\u22121, 1}. It follows that \u03b3 \u2208 (Cx \u2297 Cy )\u2217 . Since \u03b3(\u03b2) = \u22122 < 0\nwe conclude \u03b2 6\u2208 Cx \u2297 Cy as claimed.\nExample 5.4. Continuing with the previous example, we know that Sym2 (Cx ) \u2286\nSym2 (\u03c6)\u22121 (Sym2 (R4+ )) = Sym2 (Cx\u2217 )\u2217 and we show that the inclusion is strict. Let\n\u03b2 := \u2212x21 + x22 + x23 + 2x1 x2 and note that \u03b2 \u2208 Sym2 (Cx\u2217 )\u2217 because Sym2 (\u03c6)(\u03b2) =\n2(2z1 z2 + 2z1 z3 + 2z2 z4 + z32 + z42 ) and the latter is an element of Sym2 (R4+ ) which\nconsists exactly of the quadrics with nonnegative coefficients. Letting \u03b3 := (x01 )2 \u2212\n2x01 x02 \u2212 (x02 )2 + 2(x03 )2 one verifies as above that \u03b3 \u2208 Sym2 (Cx )\u2217 and that \u03b3(\u03b2) < 0 so\n\u03b2 6\u2208 Sym2 (Cx ) as claimed.\nCorollary 5.5. The following statements hold for marked cones,\n(1) The tensor product (resp. symmetric power) of SDR cones is a projection of\ntensor products (resp. symmetric powers) of spectrahedral cones.\n(2) The tensor products (resp. symmetric powers) of duals of spectrahedra are\nprojections of the tensor products of PSD cones S+ (V \u2217 ) \u2297 S+ (W \u2217 ) (resp. of\nsymmetric powers Symn (S+ (V \u2217 ))).\n(3) If A\u2217 and B are spectrahedral cones then HomAC (A, B) is isomorphic to a\nlinear section of HomAC (S+ (V \u2217 ), S+ (W \u2217 )).\nOpen Problem. Are the Homs, tensor products and symmetric powers of spectrahedral cones SDR sets? As we will show in the next section, in general they are not\nspectrahedra or even basic closed semialgebraic sets.\n6. Linearization functors on PSD cones.\nMotivated by Corollary 5.5 parts (2.) and (3.) we study the convex algebraic geometry of linearization functors on PSD cones. The results in this section suggest that\nwith very few exceptions these are very complex and very interesting objects which\nhave been studied in various forms in the past.\nRecall that for a vector space V there is a bilinear non-degenerate pairing Sym2 (V \u2217 )\u00d7\n(v)g(u)\nallowing us to identify Sym2 (V )\nSym2 (V ) \u2192 R which sends (f g, uv) to f (u)g(v)+f\n2\nand Sym2 (V \u2217 )\u2217 . The following Lemma gives several interpretations for the images of\nlinearization functors applied to PSD cones.\nLemma 6.1. Let V, W be real vector spaces and let n > 0 be an integer. The following\ncanonical identifications hold,\n(1) S+ (V )\u2217 = S+ (V \u2217 )\n(2) S+ (V ) \u2297 S+ (W ) is the convex cone over the Segre-Veronese embedding of\nP(V ) \u00d7 P(W ) in P(Sym2 (V ) \u2297 Sym2 (W )). Symn (S+ (V )) is the convex cone\nover the n-th veronese re-embedding of the second veronese embedding of P(V )\nin Symn (Sym2 (V )).\n14\n\n\f(3) (S+ (V )\u2297S+ (W ))\u2217 = HomAC (S+ (V ), S+ (W \u2217 )) = P(2,2) where P(2,2) (V \u2217 , W \u2217 ) is\nthe set of nonnegative polynomials in Sym2 (V \u2217 ) \u2297 Sym2 (W \u2217 ) (i.e. of bi-degree\n(2, 2)). More generally the dual of the tensor product of n PSD cones is the set\nof nonnegative polynomials of degree (2, . . . , 2) in n disjoint sets of variables.\n(4) Symn (S+ (V ))\u2217 is the set of nonnegative polynomials of degree (2, . . . , 2) in n\nsets of variables of the same size which are invariant under permutations of\nthese sets of variables.\nProof. (1.) The canonical identification above maps a square u2 \u2208 Sym2 (V ) to the\nelement of Sym2 (V \u2217 )\u2217 given by evaluation at the point u. It follows that the elements\nof S+ (V )\u2217 are those polynomials p \u2208 Sym2 (V \u2217 ) for which p(u) \u2265 0 for every u \u2208 V .\nSince every nonnegative quadric is a sum of squares this set is precisely S+ (V \u2217 )\nas claimed. (1.) The real Segre-Veronese embedding sends (v, w) \u2208 P(V ) \u00d7 P(W )\nto v 2 \u2297 w2 \u2208 P(Sym2 (V ) \u2297 Sym2 (W )) and S+ (V ) \u2297 S+ (W ) is the cone generated\nby the elements of this form. The second claim is identical. (3.) As above we\nidentify Sym2 (V )\u2297Sym2 (W ) \u223c\n= Sym2 (V \u2217 )\u2217 \u2297Sym2 (W \u2217 )\u2217 = (Sym2 (V \u2217 )\u2297Sym2 (W \u2217 ))\u2217 .\nUnder this identification an element v 2 \u2297 w2 goes to the evaluation of polynomials in\nSym2 (V \u2217 )\u2297Sym2 (W \u2217 ) at the point (v, w) \u2208 V \u00d7W . It follows that (S+ (V )\u2297S+ (W ))\u2217\nis the set of nonnegative polynomials in Sym2 (V \u2217 ) \u2297 Sym2 (W \u2217 ) as claimed. By\nLemma 3.3 we have the equality\n(S+ (V ) \u2297 S+ (W ))\u2217 = HomAC (S+ (V ) \u2297 S+ (W ), R+ ) = HomAC (S+ (V ), S+ (W )\u2217 ).\n(4.) By the universal property of symmetric powers we can associate to each \u03c6 \u2208\nSymn (S+ (V ))\u2217 a symmetric multilinear map T : S+ (V )n \u2192 R+ and in particular a\nmultilinear\nthus, by the universal property of tensor products, an element\nNn map and\n\u2217\ntN\u2208 ( i=1 S+ (V )) . By the previous paragraph t is a nonnegative polynomial in\nn\n2\n2\n\u2217\n\u2217\ni=1 Sym (V ) invariant under permutation of the various copies of Sym (V ) (i.e.\nof degree (2, . . . , 2), symmetric in n sets of variables of the same size).\n\u0003\nTheorem 6.2. Let V, W be vector spaces of dimensions m and n respectively. The\nfollowing statements hold:\n(1) If min(m, n) \u2264 2 then Hom(S+ (V ), S+ (W )) and Sym2 (S+ (V )) are SDR sets\nand S+ (V ) \u2297 S+ (W ) is spectrahedral.\n(2) If m = n = 3 then S+ (V ) \u2297 S+ (W ) has a non-exposed face and in particular\nis not a spectrahedron.\nProof. The map \u03a8 : Sym2 (V ) \u2297 Sym2 (W ) \u2192 (Sym2 (V \u2217 \u2297 W \u2217 ))\u2217 sending an element\n\u03c6 to the bilinear symmetric form (v1\u2217 \u2297 w1\u2217 , v2\u2217 \u2297 w2\u2217 ) \u2192 \u03c6(v1\u2217 v2\u2217 \u2297 w1\u2217 w2\u2217 ) satisfies\n\u03a8(\u03c6) \u0017 0 iff \u03c6 is nonnegative on squares in Sym2 (V \u2217 ) \u2297 Sym2 (W \u2217 ). As a result\nthe spectrahedral cone \u03a8\u22121 S+ ((V \u2217 \u2297 W \u2217 )\u2217 ) is dual to the cone of sums of squares\nin Sym2 (V \u2217 ) \u2297 Sym2 (W \u2217 ). By [6, Theorem 1] every nonnegative biquadratic form\nin (m, n) variables is a sum of squares iff min(m, n) \u2264 2. Thus, if min(m, n) \u2264 2\nthen the spectrahedron \u03a8\u22121 S+ ((V \u2217 \u2297 W \u2217 )\u2217 ) is dual to the nonnegative polynomials\n15\n\n\f[0,0,0,1][1, -2, 1, 0]\n[1,0,0,0][0, 1, -2, 1]\n[-1, 0, 0, 1][0, -3, 2, 0]\n[1, -1, 0, 0][0, 0, -4, 3]\n[4, 0, 0, -1], [0, 1,-1, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 1, 0][2, -3, 0, 1]\n[0, 0, 1,-1][2, -1, 0, 0]\n[0, -1, 1, 0][4, 0, 0, -1]\n[0, 0, -4, 3][1, -1, 0, 0]\n[0, -3, 2, 0][1, 0, 0, -1]\n\n[0, 1, 0, 0][1, 0, -3, 2]\n[0, -1, 0, 1][3, 0, -1, 0]\n[-1, 0, 1, 0][0, -2, 0, 1]\n[0, -2, 0, 1][1, 0, -1, 0]\n[3, 0, -1, 0][0, 1, 0, -1]\n\n[2, -1, 0, 0][0, 0, 1, -1]\n[0, -1, 2, -1][1, 0, 0,0]\n[1, 0, -3, 2][0, 1, 0, 0]\n[2, -3, 0, 1][0, 0, 1, 0]\n[1, -2, 1, 0][0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nin Sym2 (V \u2217 ) \u2297 Sym2 (W \u2217 ) and thus by Lemma 6.1 part (3.) coincides with S+ (V ) \u2297\nS+ (W ) as claimed. Dualizing \u03a8 we conclude that P(2,2) is an SDR cone. By Lemma 6.1\npart (4.) Symn (S+ (V )) is SDR since it is the dual of the intersection of an SDR set and\na linear subspace. (2.) By Lemma 6.1 part (3) we can identify C := S+ (V ) \u2297 S+ (W )\nwith the space of nonnegative polynomials in R[V0 , . . . , V3 , W0 , . . . , W3 ] of degree (2, 2)\n(where deg(Vi ) = (1, 0) and deg(Wi ) = (0, 1)). Via this identification the element\nv 2 \u2297 w2 acts on polynomials of degree (2, 2) via evaluation at the point (v, w). We\ndenote this evaluation operator as `(v,w) . Let\n!2\n!2\n!2\n!2\n3\n4\n4\n4\n4\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n(Xi Yi )2\nYi\nXi +\nr=\n(i + 1)Xi\n(i + 1)Yi +\ni=0\n\ni=0\n\ni=0\n\ni=0\n\ni=0\n\nand note that this is a nonnegative polynomial of degree (2, 2). The face of C defined\nby r is the cone spanned by the evaluations at the twenty real zeroes of r in P3 \u00d7 P3 :\nLet Z = {p1 , . . . , p20 } be this set of points. We will show that the set F P\n= Cone(`p :\np \u2208 Z \\ {p1 }) is a non-exposed face of C. To see that it is a face suppose\n\u03bbi `vi \u2208 F\nwith \u03bbi > 0. It follows that `vi (r) = 0 for every i and thus that, up to nonnegative\nscaling `vi = `p for some p \u2208 Z. Moreover `p1 cannot appear with nonzero coefficient\non the left hand side since otherwise we would contradict the fact that the evaluation\nmaps `pi are linearly independent. To prove that F is not exposed suppose the\ncontrary. Then there exists a nonnegative polynomial q of degree (2, 2) whose real\nzeroes are precisely the points of Z \\ {p1 }. Recall that every nonnegative polynomial\nvanishes to order at least two at any of its zeroes and thus the existence of q implies\nthe existence of a polynomial of degree (2, 2) which vanishes doubly through the points\nof Z \\ {p1 } and does not vanish at p1 . We will show that this is impossible. To this\nend, let I be the ideal of definition of the points in Z the homogeneous coordinate\nring of P3 \u00d7 P3 that is,\n!\n!\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nI=\n(Xi Yi ) +\n(i + 1)Xi\n(i + 1)Yi +\nYi\nXi\ni=0\n\ni=0\n\ni=0\n\ni=0\n\ni=0\n\nand let J be the ideal defined by the squares of the defining ideals of all points\nexcept the first. A calculation in the computer program Macaulay2 [?] shows that\nthe dimensions in degree (2, 2) of the saturations of J and I 2 with respect to the\nirrelevant ideal are both 21 so every homogeneous polynomial of degree (2, 2) doublevanishing at the points of Z \\ {p1 } vanishes also at p1 , proving that q does not exist.\nIt follows that F is a non-exposed face of C and thus that C is not a spectrahedron\nsince every face of a spectrahedron is exposed [15].\n\u0003\n16\n\n\fRemark 6.3. The previous Theorem classifies all V, W for which S+ (V ) \u2297 S+ (W ) is\na spectrahedron. As a consequence we see that it is not true in general that the tensor\nproduct of spectrahedra is a spectrahedron.\nNext we study the geometry of the cone Hom(S+ (V ), S+ (W )) following closely the\nideas of Nie [12]. We provide a self-contained proof for the reader's benefit. Recall [10,\nChapter I] that if X \u2286 P(V ) is an irreducible projective variety then a hyperplane\nH \u2208 P(V \u2217 ) is tangent to X if there exists a smooth point x \u2208 X such that the\ntangent space to x at H contains the tangent space to x at X (equivalently such that\nH vanishes to order at least two at x). Let X \u2228 denote the closure in P(V \u2217 ) of the set\nof hyperplanes tangent to X. It is well known that X \u2228 is irreducible and in most cases\na hypersurface. In this case any of its defining equations is called an X-discriminant.\nTheorem 6.4. Let V, W be vector spaces of dimensions m, n \u2265 2. The following\nstatements hold:\n(1) The algebraic boundary of Hom(S+ (V ), S+ (W \u2217 )) (i.e. the Zariski closure of\nthe boundary) is the irreducible hypersurface dual to P(V )\u00d7P(W ) in its SegreVeronese embedding in P(Sym2 (V ) \u2297 Sym2 (W )).\n(2) The strictly positive polynomial r := (x20 + * * * + x2m ) (y02 + * * * + yn2 ) belongs to\ninterior of Hom(S+ (V ), S+ (W \u2217 )) and to its algebraic boundary.\n(3) The cone Hom(S+ (V ), S+ (W \u2217 )) is not a basic closed semialgebraic set and in\nparticular not a spectrahedron.\nProof. (1.) As above we can identify Hom(S+ (V ), S+ (W \u2217 )) with the linear functionals\nin Sym2 (V \u2217 )\u2297Sym2 (W \u2217 ) which are nonnegative in the image Z of P(V )\u00d7P(W ) in its\nSegre-Veronese embedding in P(Sym2 (V ) \u2297 Sym2 (W )). Since every zero of a nonnegative polynomial in P(V )\u00d7P(W ) must be a critical point (i.e. in local coordinates the\ngradient of the polynomial must be zero) it follows that all nonnegative polynomials\nwith real zeroes correspond to linear forms in Z \u2228 . By [10, Corollary 5.11] we know\nthat Z \u2228 is an irreducible hypersurface. Since the boundary of Hom(S+ (V ), S+ (W \u2217 ))\nhas real codimension one in Sym2 (V \u2217 ) \u2297 Sym2 (W \u2217 ) it follows that Z \u2228 is the algebraic\nclosure of the boundary as claimed. (2.) The polynomial obviously has no real zero\nin P(V ) \u00d7 P(W ) and thus lies in the interior of the cone. In the affine chart where\n\u2202r\n\u2202r\nx0 y0 6= 0 we have \u2202x\n= 2xi (1 + y12 + * * * + yn2 ) and \u2202y\n= 2yi (1 + x21 + * * * + x2n ) and thus\ni\ni\nthe polynomial vanishes to order at least two at the point (1, i, 0 . . . , 0)\u00d7(1, i, 0, . . . , 0)\nand thus lies in Z \u2228 . (3.) If Hom(S+ (V ), S+ (W \u2217 )) was defined by finitely many real\npolynomials gi \u2265 0 then one of them would have to be divisible by the Z-discriminant\nand in particular would have to vanish at an interior point of the cone which is a contradiction.\n\u0003\nRemark 6.5. Recall that a barrier function for a cone C is a real-valued continuous\nfunction in the interior of C which approaches \u221e at all points of the boundary of\nC. Log-polynomial barrier functions (i.e. those which are of the form log(\u03b7) for a\npolynomial \u03b7) are a key tool of interior point optimization algorithms [13]. As observed\n17\n\n\fby Nie in [12], theorems as above imply the non-existence of a log-polynomial barrier\nfor Hom(S+ (V ), S+ (W \u2217 )). Because, if \u03c6 was a log-polynomial barrier function then\ne\u03c6 would be an algebraic function vanishing in the boundary and thus divisible by the\nZ-discriminant contradicting the continuity of the barrier \u03c6 in the interior.\n7. Schur functors on compact convex sets.\nHaving considered tensor product and symmetric power operations on convex sets\na natural next step is to study the behavior of general Schur functors (see [8, Section\n8.1] for definitions).\nLet n, m be natural numbers and let V be an m-dimensional vector space. For\na partition \u03bb of the integer n let h\u03bb : V \u2295n \u2192 S\u03bb (V ) be the universal multilinear\nmap which satisfies the \u03bb-exchange axioms (see [8, pg. 105] for a definition) sending\n(v1 , . . . , vn ) to the class of the tableau filled with the elements vi (in order, left to\nright and top to bottom).\nDefinition 10. Let P \u2286 \u0001V be a convex body containing 0. We define S\u03bb (P ) :=\nConv h\u03bb (P \u00d7 P \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 P ) \u2286 S\u03bb (V ). For a morphism T : P \u2192 Q of compact convex\nsets let S\u03bb (T ) be as in the category of vector spaces.\nRemark 7.1. It is possible to define Schur functors in AC as we did with tensors\nand symmetric powers. However, if the tableaux of shape \u03bb has more than one row\nthen the resulting cones are linear subspaces and thus uninteresting from the point of\nview of convex geometry.\nNevertheless, Schur functors are linearization functors on convex bodies (or equivalently in the category MC) leading to highly symmetric convex sets. The following\nTheorem summarizes some of their fundamental properties,\nTheorem 7.2. The following statements hold\n(1) S\u03bb is a functor in the category of compact convex sets containing the origin.\n(2) Let W be any compact convex set and let T : P \u2295n \u2192 W be any multilinear\nmap satisfying the \u03bb-exchange axioms. There is a unique morphism of compact\nconvex sets t : S\u03bb (P ) \u2192 W satisfying t \u25e6 h\u03bb = T .\n(3) S\u03bb (P ) is a convex body with dimension equal to the number of semistandard\ntableaux of shape \u03bb with entries in {1, . . . , m}. If \u03bb has more than one row\nthen S\u03bb (P ) is symmetric around the origin.\n(4) If E is the set of extreme points of P then S\u03bb (P ) equals the convex hull of\nh\u03bb (E \u2295n ). In particular, if P is a polytope then S\u03bb (P ) is a polytope.\n(5) If mP is a measure supported on P (for instance the restriction of the Lebesgue\nmeasure in V ) then mP determines an accurate approximation scheme for\nS\u03bb (P ) by projections of spectrahedra.\nProof. (1.) It suffices to verify that if f : P1 \u2192 P2 is a morphism then S\u03bb (f ) maps\nS\u03bb (P1 ) to S\u03bb (P2 ). Now, S\u03bb (f ) maps the class of a tableau [v1 , . . . , vn ] of shape \u03bb with\n18\n\n\fentries in P1 to the class of the tableau [f (v1 ), . . . , f (vn )] which is an element of S\u03bb (P2 )\nas claimed since f (vi ) \u2208 P2 for every i. (2.) Follows from the analogous universal\nproperty for Schur functors on vector spaces.(3.) The statement about dimension\nfollows from the fact that S\u03bb (P ) is full-dimensional because P contains a basis for\nV . If \u03bb has more than one row then the set of classes of tableaux (v1 , . . . , vn ) with\nvi \u2208 P is closed under multiplication by (\u22121) because the negative of a tableau can be\nobtained by exchanging two entries in the same column. Since this property extends\nto the convex closure the claim follows. (4.) Since E \u2286 P then h(E \u2295n ) \u2286 h(P \u2295n )\nand thus the convex hull of the left hand side is included in S\u03bb (P ). By the KreinMilman theorem every point of P is a convex combination of extreme points. Since\nh\u03bb is multilinear it follows that every element of h\u03bb (P \u2295n ) is a convex combination\nof elements in h(E \u2295n ) and thus equality holds. (5.) The product measure mn is\nsupported on P \u2295n and the map h\u03bb : V \u2295n \u2192 S\u03bb (V ) is a polynomial map. Lemma 4.1\ngives an accurate approximation scheme for S\u03bb (P ) via projections of spectrahedra. \u0003\nExample 7.3. Let m = 3 and let P V\nbe the cube with vertices (\u00b11, \u00b11, \u00b11). Let n = 2\nand let \u03bb = 1 + 1. Then S\u03bb (P ) = 2 (P ) is the polytope shown in the figure. Note\nthat this polytope has only 12 vertices and thus, in contrast with what occurs with\nsymmetric and tensor powers, not every element of h\u03bb (E 2 ) is an extreme point of\nS\u03bb (P ).\n\nFigure 2.
