Unique aspects of the electronic structure of graphene based 2DES's have raised\na number of new fundamental physics issues and raised\nhope for applications.\nMonolayer graphene has a honeycomb lattice structure\nand is a gapless semiconductor. Hopping between its\nequivalent A and B sublattices gives rise to a massless\nDirac fermion band structure with J = 1 chirality when\nthe sublattice degree of freedom is treated as a pseudospin. In this paper we will find it useful to view the\nquantum two-level degree of freedom associated with two\nsublattice sites as a pseudospin in the multi-layer case as\nwell. In AB-stacked graphene bilayers, for example, electrons on the A2 and B1 sublattices are repelled from the\nFermi level by a direct interlayer tunneling process with\nenergy \u03b31 , leaving8 only states that are concentrated on\nthe A1 and B2 sites in the low-energy band-structure projection. When direct hopping between A1 and B2 sites is\nneglected, the two-step hopping process via high energy\nsites leads to p2 conduction and valence band dispersions\nand to a pseudospin chirality that is doubled, i.e. to\na phase difference between sublattice projections which\nis proportional to 2\u03c6p where \u03c6p is the two-dimensional\nmomentum orientation. Pseudospin chirality has a substantial influence on interaction physics9 in both singlelayer and bilayer graphene, and through the associated\nmomentum space Berry phases also on Landau quantization and the integer quantum Hall effect.8,10\u201313 . Because\n\nthe two low-energy sublattices in bilayer graphene are located on opposite layers it is possible to introduce14\u201318 a\ngap19\u201326 in the electronic structure simply by using gates\nto induce a difference in electric potential between layers. According to some theories a small gap could even\nemerge spontaneously27\u201332 in neutral graphene bilayers\nwith weak disorder because of layer inversion symmetrybreaking.\nGraphene bilayer 2DES's are quite distinct from single layer 2DES's because of their flatter band dispersion\nand the possibility of using external potentials to create\ngaps. Among all stacking possibilities, only the ABC arrangement (see below) maintains the following features\nthat make Bernal bilayer electronic structure interesting\nin thicker N -layer films: (i) there are two low-energy sublattice sites, implying that a two band model provides a\nuseful tool to describe its physics; (ii) the low energy\nsublattice sites are localized in the outermost layers, at\nA1 and BN , and can be separated energetically by an\nelectric field perpendicular to the film; (iii) hopping between low energy sites via high energy states is an N step process which leads to pN dispersion in conduction\nand valence bands, sublattice pseudospin chirality N and\nBerry phase N \u03c0. The low-energy bands are increasingly\nflat for larger N , at least when weak remote hopping\nprocesses are neglected, and the opportunity for interesting interaction and disorder physics is therefore stronger.\nConsequently, in the simplified chiral model, the densityof-states D(E) \u223c E (2\u2212N )/N diverges as E approaches\nzero for N > 2 whereas it remains finite for N = 2 and\nvanishes for N = 1. These properties also have some relevance to more general stacking arrangements since the\nlow energy Hamiltonian of a multilayer with any type of\nstacking can always be chiral-decomposed to a direct sum\nof ABC-stacked layers.13\nABC-stacked multilayers are the chiral generalizations\n\n\f2\nof monolayer and Bernal bilayer graphene, and we refer them collectively as the chiral 2D electron system\n(C2DES) family. We believe that they are likely to prove\nto be fertile ground for new physics. As a first step in the\nexploration of these materials we report in this paper on\nan effort to characterize the way in which the chirality N\nbands of an N -layer C2DES are altered by remote hopping processes neglected in the simplified model, focusing on the N = 3 trilayer case. We use ab initio density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations, combined with a\nk * p expansion of the low-energy bands near the Dirac\npoint, to fit the parameters of a phenomenological tightbinding method (PTBM) for the \u03c0-bands of multilayer\ngraphene.13,33\u201337 We find that details of the low-energy\nband dispersion can be used to fix rather definite values\nfor the model's remote inter-layer hopping parameters.\nOur paper is organized as follows. In section II we\nfirst sketch the derivation of the low energy effective\nband Hamiltonian of a trilayer, reserving details to an\nAppendix and explain how the interlayer hopping parameters influence the shape of constant energy surfaces.\nThe values for these parameters obtained by fitting to\nour DFT calculations are surprisingly different from the\nvalues for the analogous hopping parameters in Bernal\nstacked layers, and are not yet available from experiment. In Section II we also discuss the evolution of constant energy surface pockets with energy, concentrating\non the Lifshitz transitions at which pockets combine, in\nterms of Berry phase considerations and a competition\nbetween chiral dispersion and trigonal warping. In section III we use DFT to estimate the dependence of the\ntrilayer energy gap on the external potential difference\nbetween top and bottom layers and compare with predictions based on the simplified two-band model. The\nsimplified model picture is readily extended to higher N\nand we use it to discuss trends in thicker ABC multilayers. Finally, we conclude in Section IV with a discussion\nof how Berry phases modify the integer quantum Hall\neffect and weak localization in C2DES's and with some\nspeculations on the role of electron-electron interactions\nin these two-dimensional materials.\n\nII.\n\nEFFECTIVE MODEL AND BAND\nSTRUCTURE\nA.\n\nLow Energy Effective Model\n\nIn ABC-stacked graphene layers, each layer has inequivalent triangular A and B sublattices. As illustrated\nin Fig. 1(a), each adjacent layer pair forms a AB-stacked\nbilayer with the upper B sublattice directly on top of the\nlower A sublattice, and the upper A above the center of a\nhexagonal plaquette of the layer below. Our microscopic\nanalysis uses the categorization of interlayer hopping processes illustrated in Fig. 1(b), which is analogous to the\nSlonczewski-Weiss-McClure (SWM) parametrization of\nthe tight binding model of bulk graphite with the Bernal\n\nstacking order.38 Following convention \u03b30 and \u03b31 describe\nnearest neighbor intralayer and interlayer hopping respectively, \u03b33 represents hopping between the low energy\nsites of a AB-stacked bilayer (i.e. Ai \u2194 Bi+1 (i = 1, 2)),\n\u03b34 couples low and high energy sites located on different\nlayers (i.e. Ai \u2194 Ai+1 and Bi \u2194 Bi+1 (i = 1, 2)). We\nuse \u03b32 to denote direct hopping between the trilayer low\nenergy sites, and \u03b4 as the on-site energy difference of A1\nand B3 with respect to the high energy sites. \u03b35 and \u03b36\ncorrespond to the presumably weaker couplings B1 \u2194 A3\nand S1 \u2194 S3 (S = A, B), respectively and ui is used to\ndenote the average potential of the ith layer.\n(a)a\n\n(b)a\nA2\n\nB1\n\nA1\n\nB2(A3)\nB2\n\n\u00a44\n\nA1(B3)\nB3\n\nB1(A2)\n\n\u00a42/2\n\nA2\n\nB1(A2)\n\n\u00a43\n\n\u00a41\n\nA3\nB2(A3)\n\n\u00a41\n\n\u00a43\n\nA1\n\nB2\n\n\u00a44\n\nA1(B3)\nB1\n\nB3\n\nA3\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) (a) Lattice structure of ABC-stacked\ngraphene trilayer; blue/cyan/green indicate links on the\ntop/middle/bottom layers while purple/red distinguish the\nA/B sublattices.

However, the values of the SWM parameters appropriate for\nABC-stacked trilayer graphene were previously unknown.\nWe extract their values by fitting the effective model with\nthe DFT data in the zero electric field limit.

The triple Dirac point of the trilayer's simplified\nmodel is split into three separate single Dirac points. The\nDFT theory result that the conduction valence gap vanishes along the K \u2032 M directions for which cos(3\u03c6p ) = 1\nimplies that htr is negative and helps to fix the sign of \u03b32 .\nValues for \u03b33 \u03b30 /\u03b31 and \u03b303 /\u03b312 are provided by the value\nof p at the Dirac points and the size ofpthe splitting between conduction and valence bands (2 h2ch + h2tr ) along\nthe cos(3\u03c6p ) = 0 directions.

These discrepancies are expected because of\nthe perturbative nature of the effective model and can be\npartly corrected by restoring the 1 \u2212 (v0 p)2 /\u03b312 correction\nfactor in Eq.

To extract the remote hopping parameters we first set the nearest neighbor in-plane hopping parameter \u03b30 to 3.16 eV to set the overall energy\nscale. The values of \u03b4 and, up to a sign, \u03b32 can then be\nobtained by comparing the band energies at p = 0 calculated by the two different methods.

The Dirac point distortion occurs\nbecause the direct hopping \u03b32 process does not involve\n2D translations and therefore gives a momentum independent contribution to the Hamiltonian which does not\nvanish at the Brillouin-zone corners. A similar distortion\nof the simplified-model ideal chirality Dirac point occurs\nin any 3m-layer system of ABC stacked (m is a positive\ninteger) graphene sheets. Around each deformed Dirac\ncone there is a electron (hole)-like pocket in the conduction(valence) band at low carrier densities and two Lifshitz transitions41 as a function of carrier density. Take\nthe conduction band for example. As shown in Fig. 4(a),\nimmediately above zero energy, the constant energy surface consists of three separate Dirac pockets. At the\nfirst critical energy 6.7 meV, the three electron pockets\ncombine and a central triangle-like hole pocket appears.\n(Energies are measured from the Fermi energy of a neutral trilayer.) At this energy three band-structure saddle\npoints occur midway between the shifted Dirac points,\nand thus the density-of-states diverges. Fermi levels close\nto these 2D logarithmic van Hove singularities could lead\nto broken symmetry states. At the second critical energy 7.2 meV, the central pocket and the three remote\npockets merge into a single pocket with a smoothed triangle shape. Fig. 4(a) is in excellent agreement with\nconstant energy surfaces constructed directly from our\nDFT calculations (Figure not shown). The two similar\nLifshitz transition energies in the valence band occur at\n\u22127.9 meV and \u22129.9 meV. The constant energy surface\nat the second Lifshitz transition solves\nE (\u00b1) (p 6= 0) = E (\u00b1) (p = 0) ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere +(\u2212) refers to conduction and valence band cases.\nThis critical condition can be specified using the law of\ncosines as shown in Fig. 5, where for trilayers \u03c6Berry =\n3\u03c0 and h0 = |\u03b32 /2| \u00b1 2v0 v4 p2 /\u03b31 . This momentumdependent trigonometric condition can be easily generalized to the case of any other graphene multilayer and\nto the case with an external potential difference.

(6) as illustrated in Fig. 4(b). The ABC-stacked trilayer trigonal\ndistortion has a different orientation and is weaker. The\ndifference mainly reflects a difference in the sign of \u03b33 ,\nwhich favors anti-bonding orbitals at low energies. The\nwarping of the constant energy surface becomes hexagonal at 8 \u223c 9 meV, which provides nearly parallel flat\npieces on the edges of the hexagon leading to strong nesting. This might support some competing ground states\nand a density-wave ordered phase might then exist at\na small but finite interaction strength. The electronic\nproperties of low-carrier density systems in graphene trilayers will be sensitive to these detailed band features.\nFuture ARPES experiments should be able to determine\nwhether or not these features are predicted correctly by\nour DFT calculations.\n\nIII.\n\nINDUCED BAND GAPS IN TRILAYERS\nA.\n\nEnergy Bands with Electric Fields\n\nFig. 6 shows the energy band structure of a ABCstacked graphene trilayer for several external electric potential differences between the outermost layers. In the\npresence of an external field, as in the graphene bilayer\ncase, the energy gap is direct but, because the low-energy\nspectrum develops a Mexican hat structure as the electric\npotential difference increases, occurs away from the K or\nK \u2032 point. Charge transfer from the high-potential layer\nto the low-potential layer partially screens the external\npotential in both bilayer and multilayer cases. Fig. 7(a)\nplots the screened potential U and Fig. 7(b) the energy\ngap, as a function of the external potential Uext for bilayers and trilayers calculated using both DFT and the full\nband self-consistent Hartree approximation. The simple\nmodel Hartree calculations agree quite well with the DFT\nresults generally. We find that the screening is stronger\nin a trilayer system, and that the maximum energy gap\nis slightly smaller.

G = 4\u03c0/( 3a) is the length\nof the reciprocal vectors and k = 0 is a K point.\n\nB.\n\nSelf-Consistent Hartree Calculation\n\nAs in the bilayer case, it is interesting to develop a\ntheory of gap formation and external potential screening\nfor ABC trilayers by combining the low-energy effective\nmodel with a Poisson equation which takes Hartree interactions into account. This simplified approach provides\na basis for discussing the dependence on layer number for\ngeneral N . We therefore consider an isolated graphene\nN -layer with an interlayer separation d = 0.335nm under an external electric field Eext perpendicular to the\nlayers, neglecting the finite thickness and crystalline inhomogeneity of the graphene layers. In an isolated system charge can only be transferred between layers so that\nn = nt + nb = 0. Defining \u03b4n = nb = \u2212nt and using a\nPoisson equation, we find that the screened electric potential difference U between the outermost layers is\nU = Uext + 4\u03c0e2 (N \u2212 1) d \u03b4n .\n\n(9)\n\nIn the two-band effective model, \u03b4n is accumulated\nthrough the layer pseudospin polarization of the valence\nband states and is thus given by the following integral\nover momentum space:\nX Z\nd2 k\n\u03c3z\n2\n\u03b4n =\n\u03c8i (k)\n\u03c8i (k) ,\n(10)\n2\n2\nBZ (2\u03c0)\ni\u2208v\nwhere the factor 2 accounts for spin degeneracy, |\u03c8i (k)i\nis a band eigenstate in the presence of Eext , band index i runs over all the filled valence band states, and\n\u03c3z /2 denotes the layer-pseudospin.

For Uext < \u03b31 /2, the\nenergy regime over which the low-energy effective model\napplies, we see that screening increases systematically\nwith N because of smaller gaps between conduction and\nvalence band orbitals which make the occupied valence\nband orbitals more polarizable. The comparison between\nthe simplified chiral model and the low-energy effective\nmodel for N = 3 demonstrates that remote hopping processes suppress screening because they tend to increase\nthe gap between conduction and valence bands at momenta near the Brillouin-zone corner.\n0.30\n0.25\n0.20\nU\u0090\u03931\n\nN=5,Chiral\nN=4,Chiral\n\n0.15\n\nN=3,Chiral\n\n0.10\n\nN=3,Full\n0.05\nN=2,Chiral\n0.00\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\nUext\u0090\u03931\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\nFIG. 8: (Color online) U v.s.

Furthermore exchange potentials will\nalso be altered by an external electric field and influence\nthe screening. Since exchange interactions are attractive, they always work against screening and will make\na negative contribution to the screening ratio we have\ndiscussed in multilayers. Because the low energy eigenstates in multilayers are coherent superpositions of states\nlocalized in different layers, our DFT calculations which\nemploy a local exchange approximation, might also yield\ninaccurate results for the screening ratio. In fact simple\nmeasurements of the screening properties might provide a\nvaluable window on many-body physics in ABC-stacked\ngraphene multilayers which lies outside the scope of commonly employed approximations.\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe have derived an effective model for the lowenergy conduction and valence bands of an ABC-stacked\ngraphene multilayer. The low-energy model can be\nviewed as a momentum-dependent pseudospin Hamilto-\n\nnian, with the pseudospin constructed from the low energy sites on the top and bottom layers. The simplified\nversion of this model starts from a \u03c0-band tight-binding\nmodel with only nearest neighbor hopping and yields a\npseudospin magnetic field whose magnitude varies as momentum pN in an N-layer stack and whose direction is\nN \u03c6p where \u03c6p is the momentum orientation. The likely\nimportance of electron-electron interactions in multilayers can be judged by comparing the characteristic band\nand interaction energies in a system\n\u221a with carrier density n and Fermi wavevector pF \u221d n. The characteristic Coulomb interaction energy per-particle in all cases\ngoes like e2 n1/2 , while the band energy goes like nN/2 .\nFor low-carrier densities the band energy scale is always\nsmaller. In the case of trilayer ABC graphene, the interaction energy scale is larger than the band energy scale\nfor carrier density n < 1012 cm\u22122 .\nAlthough interactions are clearly important and can\npotentially introduce new physics, the chiral band model\nis not valid at low-densities because of the influence of\nremote hopping processes which we have estimated in this\narticle by carefully fitting a low-energy effective model\nto DFT bands. The Hamiltonian in Eq. (6) combined\nwith the parameters in Table I should be used to describe\ngraphene trilayers with low carrier densities. In a realistic\nsystem the Fermi surface of a ABC trilayer with a low\ncarrier density consists of three electron pockets centered\naway from the K point. As the carrier density grows\nthese pockets convert via a sequence of two closely spaced\nLifshitz transitions into a single K-centered pocket. The\ncarrier density at the Lifshitz transition is \u223c 1011 cm\u22122 ,\nwhich translates to a Coulomb interaction scale of \u223c 45\nmeV, compared to a Fermi energy of \u223c 7 meV.\nThe Berry phase associated with the momentumdependence of the pseudospin orientation field, \u03c0 for a\nfull rotation in single-layers and 2\u03c0 in the bilayer chiral\nmodel for example, is known42\u201348 to have an important\ninfluence on quantum corrections to transport. Because\nof their very different Berry phases time-reversed paths\nare expected to interfere destructively for N -odd systems\nwhile constructively for N -even system, leading to weak\nanti-localization for odd N and weak localization for even\nN . This general tendency will however be altered by\ntrigonal and other corrections to the low-energy effective\nHamiltonian, like those we have derived for trilayers. The\ninfluence of these band features on quantum corrections\nto transport can be evaluated starting from the results\nobtained here.\nAnother important consequence of Berry phases in the\nchiral model is the unconventional Landau level structure it yields8,10\u201313 . In the chiral model for ABC trilayers there is a three-fold degeneracy at the Dirac point,\nin addition to the usual spin and valley degeneracies.\nThis grouping of Landau level leads to the expectation that quantum Hall studies in trilayers will reveal\nplateaus that jump from one at \u22126e2 /h to one at 6e2 /h.\nElectron-electron interactions acting alone are expected\nto lift these degeneracies and give rise to quantum Hall\n\n\f9\nferromagnetism49\u201351 . These interaction effects will act in\nconcert with small corrections to the Landau level structures due to the remote hopping terms that have been\nquantified in this paper.\nAlthough we have discussed the case of ABC stacked\ntrilayers, we expect qualitatively similar results for ABC\nstacking sequences of general thickness N . At low energies the band structure will consist of a conduction and\na valence band with pN dispersion and a gap in the presence of an external electric field across the film. In the\npresence of a magnetic field N Landau levels are pinned\nto the neutral system Fermi level for each spin and valley.\nAt the lowest energies, within around 10meV of the neutral system Fermi level, constant energy surfaces will be\nstrongly influenced by remote hopping processes which\nwill also split the Dirac point Landau levels. The remote hopping terms give rise to saddle-points in the band\nstructure at which the density-of-states will diverge. Broken symmetry electronic states are mostly likely to occur when the Fermi level is coincident with these saddle\npoints. The energy range over which the low-energy effective model applies will, however, decrease with film\nthickness. We expect both disorder and interaction effects to be strong within this family of low-dimensional\nelectron systems, which should be accessible to experimental study in samples for which disorder is weak on the\nenergy scale over which the low-energy effective model\napplies.\nIn summary, we have derived an effective model for\ntrilayers, extracted the hopping parameters for ABCstacked multilayers, from DFT and studied the trilayer\nFermi surfaces. Furthermore, we have explored the\nscreening effect in trilayers and then explained and compared with other C2DES cases by a tight-binding model\nself-consistent Hartree method. Lastly, we have argued the importance of Berry phases and interactions\nin C2DES.\n\n(a)a\n\n(b)a\n\nB1\n\nA1\n\nB1\n\nA1\n\u00a40\n\n\u00a4\u0014\n\u00a42/2\n\nA2\n\nB2\n\n\u00a4\u0013\n\nA2\n\nB2\n\u00a4\u0014\n\u00a4\u0013\n\nB3\n\nA3\n\nB3\n\n(c)a\n\nA3\n\n(d)a\n\nB1\n\nA1\n\nB1\n\nA1\n\n\u00a4\u0013\n\u00a4\u0014\n\n\u00a43\n\nA2\n\nB2\n\nA2\n\nB2\n\n\u00a43\n\n\u00a4\u0014\n\u00a4\u0013\nB3\n\nA3\n\nB3\n\n(e)a\nB1\n\n\u00a4\u0014\n\nA3\n\n(f )a\n\u00a4\u0013\n\nA1\n\nB1\n\n\u00a4\u0014\n\n\u00a4\u0017\n\nA2\n\nB2\n\nB3\n\nA3\n\n\u00a4\u0013\n\nA1\n\n\u00a4\u0017\n\nA2\n\nB2\n\nB3\n\nA3\n\nFIG. 9: (Color online) Schematic of hoppings from A1 to B3 ;\n(a) one-step A1 \u2192 B3 and (b) three-step A1 \u2192 B1 A2 \u2192\nB2 A3 \u2192 B3 and (c) (d) two-step A1 \u2192 B1 A2 \u2192 B3 and\nA1 \u2192 B2 A3 \u2192 B3 .

Hereafter, we view the strongly stacked pair Bi Ai+1\nas a single dimer site and assume zero external potentials for simplicity. The general formula of effective low\nenergy models Eq. (5) can be understood as following.\nThe terms in the second parenthesis represent the leading hopping processes, while the terms in the first parenthesis are approximately 1 \u2212 (v0 p/\u03b31 )2 and give a small\ncorrection. H11 is the unperturbed Hamiltonian of low\nenergy sites and thus includes the direct hopping and onsite energy. H21 and H12 are hoppings from and to low\nenergy sites, respectively, describing the coupling to high\nenergy ones. H22 contains the hoppings between high\nenergy sites and is an intermediate process. Therefore\nH12 (H22 )\u22121 H21 together gives the general \"three\"-step\nhoppings which start from and end at low energy sites\n\n\f10\nby way of high energy ones. Note that the intermediate\nprocess within high energy sites is zero for single layers, a constant for bilayers, one-step for trilayers, and\nmulti-step for N \u2265 3 layers. In bilayers for example, the\nlinear trigonal warping term arises from H11 , while the\nchiral term attributes to H12 (H22 )\u22121 H21 . Because H22\ngives no hopping and is simply \u03b31 , H12 (H22 )\u22121 H21 is reduced to two-step and hence the chiral term is quadratic.\nIn the trilayer case, for the matrix element B3 A1 , H11\nprovides the first term of \u0124tr shown in Fig. 9(a) while\nH12 (H22 )\u22121 H21 contributes \u0124ch and the second term\nof \u0124tr as depicted in Fig. 9(b) and (c)(d), respectively.\nH12 (H22 )\u22121 H21 also gives rise to the second term of \u0124s\nfor the matrix element A1 A1 as presented in Fig. 9(e)(f).\nGenerally, in order to derive the low energy effective\n\n\u2217\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n11\n\n12\n13\n\n14\n15\n\n16\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n\n25\n26\n27\n\n28\n\nElectronic address: zhangfan@physics.utexas.edu\nK.

(2), then we specify all the leading hopping processes\nin the diagrammatic language like Fig. 9, instead of inverting the large Hamiltonian matrix. The hopping diagrams are convenient for systematic calculations in a\nway similar to the way Feynman diagrams help in perturbation theories. The exact coefficient of one hopping\nprocess can be easily calculated using Eq. (5) by picking\nup the starting and ending sites, setting matrix elements\nof unrelated sites as zero and turning off the unrelated\nhopping parameters. Frequently, one hopping process\ncan be neglected because its requirement of more than\none sub-hopping with comparably small amplitudes.\n\n29\n\n30\n\n31\n32\n\n33\n\n34\n\n35\n\n36\n37\n38\n\n39\n\n40\n41\n42\n\n43\n\n44\n\n45\n46\n\n47\n\n48\n49\n\n50\n\n51\n\nH.
