In starforming sites, the stellar winds and supernovae explosions provide heat and momentum to the surrounding ISM changing its thermodynamic properties and kinematics, and sometimes driving galactic scale superwinds\n(Heckman et al. 1990, Martin et al. 2002). Such outflows from starforming regions\ncarry metals that can enrich the intergalactic medium (IGM) and suppress further\nstarforming activity (Oppenheimer & Dav\u00e9 2006). Galactic scale outflows/winds\nhave been called upon to account for the mass-metallicity relation, to shape the luminosity function of galaxies, especially at the faint end slope, and to account for the\nkinematics of neutral gas in Damped Lyman Alpha systems (Tremonti et al. 2004,\nScannapieco et al. 2008, Hong et al. 2010).\nDespite the importance of understanding stellar feedback in the context of galaxy\nevolution, its observational constraints are still ill-defined. One of the largest unknowns is the \"energy efficiency\" of feedback, i.e. the fraction of a starburst's\nmechanical energy that is available to drive large-scale outflows. This is linked,\nin the momentum-driven scenario, to the momentum transfer between the sources\n(supernovae, stellar winds) and the surrounding ISM coupled with radiative-driven\npressure (Murray, Quataert, & Thompson 2005). On a more global scale, it is important to understand whether feedback and its efficiency can be linked to global\ngalactic parameters like specific SFR or the depth of the galactic potential well (i.e.\nescape velocity). In this respect, local starburst galaxies are undoubtedly excellent\nlaboratories to study the feedback interaction in great details.\nBy investigating nearby galaxies, Martin (2005, 2006) suggests that a relation is\npresent between outflow speed and SFR, and that the kinetic energy contained in the\noutflowing material is a few percent of the available mechanical energy from massive\nstar winds and supernovae. This implies that although the fraction of mechanical\nenergy deposited in the ISM is high, only a small fraction is available to drive the\noutflow.\nHere we concentrate on the starburst and H II regions hosted in the center of the\nmassive spiral galaxy M83, in order to investigate the interface between star forma-\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\ntion and shocked gas not only in the powerful starburst, but also in the H II regions\nhosted in the spiral arms of the galaxy. We perform a differential analysis of the\nshocked gas surrounding the central starburst and the spiral arm H II regions, with\nthe goals of deriving the fraction of energy deposited in shocks and their morphology.\nThe line diagnostic diagram from nebular line emission, [O III](5007\u00c5)/H\u03b2 vs.\n[S II](6716\u00c5+6731\u00c5)(or [N II](6583\u00c5))/H\u03b1 ), has been used to study the starburst\nor AGN activity in galaxies (Baldwin, Phillips, & Terlevich 1981, Kewley et al. 2001;\nhereafter K01) and to investigate the ionized gas structure of ISM for resolved regions\n(e.g. Calzetti et al. 2004; hereafter C04, Westmoquette et al. 2007). The HST's\nhigh angular resolution is crucial to study the ionized gas structure, especially for\nshock-ionized gas, since, in general, the shocked gas is distributed in a thin layer,\neasily confused with photo-ionization in low resolution ground-based observations.\nWe also need accurate ionization models since there is no strict boundary between\nphoto-ionized gas and shock-ionized gas in the diagnostic diagram. In this paper\nwe focus on the diagnostic diagram of M83 for the structure of ionized gas from the\nnewly available data obtained with the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) onboard the\nHubble Space Telescope (HST).\nThe galaxy M83 is the nearest face-on grand-design spiral with Hubble type\nSAB(s)c, at a distance of 4.47 Mpc (Kennicutt et al. 2008). There is an ongoing\ncentral starburst possibly fueled by gas inflow along the main stellar bar connecting\nthe double circumnuclear rings found in the center (Trinchieri et al. 1985, Elmegreen\n1998, C04). To study the non-photoionized gas (mostly shock-ionized gas driven by\nstellar feedback) in the central region, C04 analyzed Wide Field Planetary Camera\n2 (WFPC2) images on a pixel-by-pixel basis and compared the line diagnostics with\nthe photo-ionization model of K01 and shock-excited line ratios from Shull & McKee (1979). To separate the shock-ionized gas from photo-ionized gas, C04 used\nthe \"maximum starburst line\" of K01. Because the \"maximum starburst line\" is a\nconservative boundary for shocks, the shock measurement from those authors is a\nlower limit to the actual fraction of shock emission. They find that the fraction of\nshock-ionized H\u03b1 luminosity to photo-ionized luminosity is \u223c 3% in M83. Unlike\nthe dwarf galaxies, also analyzed in that paper, the geometrical morphology of shock\nionized gas in M83 was compact, rather than diffuse and shell-like, possibly due to\nthe deeper potential well in this more massive galaxy.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nWe provide, in this paper, the observed line diagnostics of the center and the\ninner spiral arm of M83, and compare the data with theoretical expectations for the\nline ratios. In section \u00a72, we describe the data set and the reduction procedures,\nincluding a detailed discussion of how to remove emission line contamination from\nbroad/medium band filters and [N II] contamination from the H\u03b1 line filter. Then we\npresent our results on the ionized gas structures and interpretations from theoretical\nmodels in section \u00a73. The summary follows in section \u00a74.\n\n2.\n\nObservations and Data Reduction\n2.1.\n\nThe WFC3 data set\n\nOur WFC3 data are part of the WFC3 Science Oversight Committee (SOC)\nEarly Release Science (ERS) program (program ID11360, PI: Robert O'Connell).\nThe observed field, centered at R.A. = 13:37:04.42, DEC. = -29:51:28.0 (J2000),\ncovers the nuclear starburst region and the inner part of northeast spiral arm of M83.\nThree or four (depending on the filter) spatially dithered exposures were used to remove cosmic rays through the MultiDrizzle software (Fruchter et al. 2009). We adopt\nthe PHOTFLAM values, available in URL:http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/phot zp lbn,\nto convert instrumental data number(DN) to physical flux. We use the flux calibration value of F658N for F657N, for which a calibration is not available, since their\nvalues for line emissions are similar within a few percent. The detailed information\nabout our data set is summarized in Table 1. Before we derive line ratio maps, we\nrebin the images by 5 \u00d7 5 pixels to reduce registration errors. The binned pixel size\nis 0.2\u2032\u2032 or 4.3 pc in physical scale; i.e. smaller than the typical size of an H II region,\nbut comparable to the physical size of star clusters (Maiz-Apellaniz 2001).\n\n2.2.\n\nContinuum Subtraction and [N II] Correction\n\nThe F487N and F502N narrowband filters each contain one line emission per\nfilter (H\u03b2 and [O III](5007\u00c5) , respectively, redshifted to the recession velocity of\nM83, 513 km/s). F657N and F673N contain multiple lines. In the case of F673N,\nthe lines are both [S II], from the 6716\u00c5 and 6731\u00c5 doublet, so we will simply\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nconsider the sum of the two. In the F657N filter, the [N II] doublet at rest frame\n6548\u00c5 and 6584\u00c5 is included in the filter bandpass in addition to H\u03b1 . Hence,\nwe have simpler filter throughput equations to obtain H\u03b2 and [O III](5007\u00c5) fluxes\nthan H\u03b1 and [S II](6716\u00c5+6731\u00c5). As a trade-off, however, the stellar continuum\ncontained in the F487N and F502N filter is more affected by variations in the stellar\npopulation mix and the local dust extinction than the redder lines, which means\ntheir stellar continuum estimates have worse intrinsic accuracy than F657N and\nF673N. Furthermore, the F555W filter, which we use as the broad-band continuum\nfilter to estimate the stellar contribution to F487N and F502N, is self-contaminated\nby H\u03b2 and [O III](5007\u00c5); we assume [O III](4959\u00c5) is negligible compared to the\ntwo other lines. Therefore, we have to correct our filter fluxes for the following: (1)\ncontamination of H\u03b2 and [O III](5007\u00c5) in the F555W filter, (2) [N II] contamination\nin F657N.\nTo subtract the H\u03b2 and [O III](5007\u00c5) lines from the F555W image, we apply\nan iterative method which can be schematically described as:\nCont0 \u2190 F 555W\n\u0002\n\nH\u03b2i \u2190 F 487N \u2212 Conti\n\u0003\nO III i \u2190 F 502N \u2212 Conti\n\nConti+1 \u2190 F 555W \u2212 H\u03b2i \u2212 [O III]i\nwhere each term represents the flux calibrated image for the denoted line emission and\nfilter. In this method, the starting value for the stellar continuum is the uncorrected\nF555W, Cont0 . With it, we obtain the first guesses to the H\u03b2 and [O III](5007\u00c5)\nemission line images by subtracting the stellar continuum from the respective narrowband filters. Then, by subtracting those first-guess line emissions from f555w, we can\nderive the first order corrected continuum, Cont1 . We can iterate the procedure until\nthe image converges. This procedure is similar in concept to the iterative procedure\napplied in Mackenty et al. (2000) for NGC4214.\nTo quantify the improvement of the iterative method, we compare the corrected\nF555W continuum after each iteration with the F547M image available in the HST\narchive for the central region of M83, since F547M is a line emission-free filter. We\n\u2212\u03bcF 555W\nproduce a residual image, F 547M\n, for each iteration step to investigate the\nF 547M\neffect of each iteration on the F555W image. The parameter, \u03bc, is chosen to minimize\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nthe difference between the images in the two filters and is related to the scaling factor\nfor the stellar continuum subtraction from narrow-band images.\nFigure 1 shows the pixel histogram of residual image for each iteration. The\nuncorrected, 0th iterated, residual image shows a negative mean which indicates\nexcess flux from H\u03b2 and [O III](5007\u00c5) in F555W. After the 1st iteration, the residual\nimages show a more symmetric pixel histogram than the uncorrected one showing\nthat the iterations remove the excess of line emission in F555W. The difference\nbetween the uncorrected and the 1st corrected is appreciable especially in localized\nregions, where flux changes up to 100% have been measured. Further iterations\ndo not change the F555W image appreciably. To quantify the difference for each\niteration step, we shows the mean (top) and the standard deviation (bottom) of the\nresidual images (left) and the corrected F555W (right) in Figure 2. We can observe\nthat 1, at most 2, iterations are sufficient to reach convergence. The converged\nresidual histogram in Figure 1 can be considered as an intrinsic difference between\nthe two filters. We take as final H\u03b2 and [O III](5007\u00c5) emission line images those\nresulting from the second-iterated F555W stellar continuum image.\nThe optimal scale factor to be applied to the broad band images for continuum\nsubtraction in the narrow band filters is found with the skewness transition method\n(Hong et al. 2011; in prep). The skewness is defined as\nN\n\n1 X xi \u2212 m \u00013\nskewness =\nN \u2212 1 i=1\n\u03c3\n, where m is the mean, \u03c3 is the standard deviation, and N is the number of pixels\nin a sample image. The skewness is generally used to measure asymmetry of a\nstatistical distribution. For symmetric functions, the value of the skewness is zero.\nIf a distribution has a long \"right\" tail, the skewness of the distribution is positive;\ni.e. positive-skewed. For a distribution with a long \"left\" tail, the skewness is\nnegative; i.e. negative-skewed. For an image of blank sky, the pixel histogram is\ngenerally gaussian (or poissonian). So the skewness is zero (or a small positive\nnumber). Additional astronomical sources in a blank field, therefore, are weighing\non the right-hand side of pixel distribution which makes the distribution \"positiveskewed\". Since the continuum subtraction process removes stellar flux from the\nnarrow-band image, increasing the subtraction weight decreases the skewness value.\nIn a perfectly-subtracted narrow-band image, the skewness of the image pixels that\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\ndo not contain line emission is zero for a gaussian background. Our method attempts\nto recover the optimal stellar continuum subtraction value by exploiting this property\nof the skewness. Our simulations (Hong et al. 2011) show that the skewness function\nshows a \"transition\" in correspondence of the optimal scaling factor for the stellar\ncontinuum. So, by locating where this transition occurs in our HST images, we have\nderived the optimal scaling factor for each narrow-band filter.\nIt should be noted that the use of a single scaling factor across each image\nassumes that large color gradients (due to either changes in the stellar population\nmix or in the dust extinction) are not present across the broad band filters. For\nF657N and F673N, this assumption is mitigated by interpolating the two broad\nband filters, F814W and the corrected F555W, to derive stellar continuum images\nat the appropriate wavelength. Furthermore, except for a few regions in the nucleus\nof M83, colors do not change dramatically across the F555W or F814W filter band\npasses. We use a single continuum image interpolated at the intermediate wavelength\n660 nm for both of F657N and F673N. Since the widths of the broad-band images\nare larger than 100 nm, the interpolated image at 660nm can be used as continuum\nfor nearby emission lines located within a couple of 10 nm.\nWe produce two subtracted versions (optimized subtraction for the central region\nand the spiral arm each) for [O III](5007\u00c5) and H\u03b2 , since the bluer continuum\nF555W suffers from more local deviation from color differences of background stellar\npopulation than the redder filters. We take a single optimized subtraction for H\u03b1 and\n[S II](6716\u00c5+6731\u00c5). We consider potential changes in color within the broad band\nfilters as a source of error in our photometry.\nWe assume that [S II](6716/6731) \u2248 1.2, since the ratios are between 1.0 and\n1.4 in the ISM of M83 (Bresolin & Kennicutt 2002; hereafter BK02). For the [N\nII] correction to H\u03b1 , we adopt the spectroscopic flux ratios, [N II]/H\u03b1 = 0.42 for\nthe spiral arm and 0.54 for the center from BK02. We, thus, generate two \"H\u03b1\"\nonly maps; one with the [N II] subtraction optimized for the central region, and one\noptimized for the spiral areas (Note that H\u03b2 and [O III](5007\u00c5) have two optimized\nversions due to different continuum subtraction, while for H\u03b1 due to different [N\nII] correction). The [N II]/H\u03b1 ratios range from 0.40 to 0.47 in the spiral arm and\nfrom 0.53 to 0. 56 in the center. The difference of the corrected H\u03b1 fluxes within\neach of these ranges is less than 10 %, which is small enough to be negligible in our\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nanalysis. C04 used the relation [N II] \u2248 2\u00d7[S II] too as an alternative method for\n[N II] correction . The ratio [N II]/[S II] has been observed to be relatively constant,\nsince the ratio has less dependences on abundance and extreme variations in UV\nradiation (Rand 1998, Kewley & Dopita 2002). C04 discusses the [N II] correction\nin more details. Our adopted method produces results similar to those of C04. A\nsummary is given in Table 1 of the images or combination of images used for the\nstellar continuum subtraction of each narrow-band image.\n\n3.\n\nResults\n\nFigure 3 shows the continuum subtracted images for H\u03b1 , H\u03b2 , [O III](5007\u00c5),\nand [S II](6716\u00c5+6731\u00c5) with 4\u03c3 cuts (see Table 1 for a list of the 1 \u03c3 flux levels). For\nH\u03b2 and [O III](5007\u00c5), the stellar continuum subtractions optimized for the central\nregions are presented. We take 4\u03c3 cuts for all the narrowband images because of the\nweakness of [O III](5007\u00c5) emission. Deeper rejection cuts would remove enough of\nthe [O III] emissions to remove most of the shock-ionized signal. As shown in Figure 3,\nthe surface brightness of [O III](5007\u00c5) is the major limiting factor to the number\nof data points in the diagnostic diagram. To compensate for this limitation, we also\nutilize the shock criteria from the [S II](6716\u00c5+6731\u00c5)/H\u03b1 ratio. This method is\nless rigorous for shock separation than the diagnostic diagram but it can include\nmore area for our investigation, since [S II](6716\u00c5+6731\u00c5) is substantially brighter\nthan [O III](5007\u00c5) in M83.\nWe select four regions within the field of view of our narrow band images, which\nare plotted as squares overlaid on the H\u03b2 image in Figure 4. The four sub-regions are\nlabeled A1(red), A2(green), A3(blue), and A4(magenta). These regions are bright\nenough in [O III](5007\u00c5) to enable analysis in the diagnostic diagram. They are\ngeometrically separated from each other and span a total galactocentric separation\nof 2.5 kpc, which can probe the change of physical properties from the center to the\nspiral arms.\nIn star forming regions, ultraviolet(UV) photons from stellar objects and hot\ncoronal gas heated by shocks are the major source of ionization of the surrounding\nISM. The total luminosity and hardness of the UV radiation are determined by a\ncombination of star forming history, metal abundance, stellar atmosphere model,\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nand stellar evolution tracks. We will refer to this as \"photo-ionization\". The other\nmechanism is collisional ionization that takes place in shocks caused by stellar winds\nand supernovae. The stellar feedback energy from supernovae and stellar winds heats\nup the surrounding gas and produces hot bubbles in star forming sites. Since the\ntemperature in hot bubbles is over a million degrees, the bubble is generally faint in\nthe optical, while it is bright in the X-ray. The over-pressure set up in the bubble by\nthe feedback energy pushes out the surrounding gas and produces shocks in the interface between the bubble and the ambient ISM. When the shock becomes radiative\nin the early adiabatic phase, the upstreaming radiation from the shock layers ionizes\nthe pre-shock gas. Unlike stellar emission, the radiation from shock layers is dominated by free-free emission of hot coronal gas, so the properties of the shock emission\nare different from those of the stellar emission. We term this as \"shock-ionization\".\nThe diagnostic diagram, [O III](5007\u00c5)/H\u03b2 vs. [S II](6716\u00c5+6731\u00c5)/H\u03b1 , has been\ntraditionally used to discern these two ionization mechanisms and many ionization\nmodels provide predictions based on this diagnostic diagram for comparison with\nobserved data.\nFigure 5 shows the distribution of the data points (0.2\u2032\u2032 pixels) from each of\nthe four subregions on the diagnostic diagram, together with theoretical tracks from\nvarious ionization models of K01. Figure 6 shows the data points from all four\nsubregions on a single diagram. By comparing the data points with the theoretical\ngrids, we can infer many properties for the ionized gas in M83. In the following\nsections we present in detail results about the photo-ionized gas, the shock-ionized\ngas, and the implications of different choices for separating the two components.\n\n3.1.\n\nPhoto-ionized Gas\n\nFigure 6 shows the overall distribution of the ionized gas in M83 on the diagnostic\ndiagram. The grey lines are photo-ionization models from K01 and the black lines\nare shock-ionization models from Allen et al. (2008; hereafter, A08), which will be\ndescribed later in the section. The photo-ionized grids adopted from K01 are based on\nthe stellar population synthesis model STARBURST99 and the gas ionization code\nMAPPINGS III (Leitherer et al 1999, Binette et al. 1985, Sutherland & Dopita 1993).\nThe spectral energy distributions (SED) generated from STARBURST99 provide the\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nphoto-ionization source and the MAPPINGS III code calculates the ionization states\nand the line emission fluxes. From those, we can derive the theoretical line ratios\nfor photo-ionization. The plotted photo-ionization grids in Figure 6 are calculated\nassuming a constant star formation history, Geneva stellar evolution tracks (Schaller\net al. 1992), and Lejeune stellar atmosphere models (Lejeune et al. 1997); see K01\nfor more details. While the assumption of constant star formation may not strictly\napply to the spiral area H II regions, it is a good representation of star formation in\nthe starburst nucleus of M83 (C04). The case of instantaneous burst models will be\ndiscussed later in this section.\nThe selected ISM densities are 10 and 350 cm\u22123 which we take as representative\nof the ISM conditions in M83, and the metallicities are chosen to be 1.0Z\u2299 and 2.0Z\u2299 ,\nthe range observed in the galaxy (BK02). The dimensionless ionization parameter,\nq, defined as the ratio of mean photon density to mean atom density, ranges from\n5.0 \u00d7 106 to 3.0 \u00d7 108 for each model. The line called \"Photoionization Limit\" in the\nlegend of Figure 6 is the conservative track termed \"Maximum Starburst Line\" in\nK01. Above and to the right of this track, line ratios can not be explained by photoionization. Since the outputs of STARBURST99 depend on a variety of inputs, such\nas stellar evolution tracks, stellar atmosphere models, and star formation history,\nwe can use our theoretical grids primarily for qualitative comparisons rather than a\nquantitative analysis.\nOne of the interesting results from the photo-ionized zone in Figure 6 is that\nthe observed [O III]/H\u03b2 ratios at low [S II]/H\u03b1 values span the range covered\nby the photo-ionization models for different values of the metallicity; higher [O\nIII](5007\u00c5)/H\u03b2 ratios correspond to lower metallicity in the models. Generally\n[O III](5007\u00c5)/H\u03b2 ratios are not enough to determine the metallicity of a region\n(Kewley & Dopita 2002), except in the range between solar abundance to super-solar\nabundance. The red \"P\" box in Figure 6 is a photo-ionized region, where the [O\nIII](5007\u00c5)/H\u03b2 line ratio is sensitive to metallicity. We re-project the pixels of the\nP box on the line emission images and select small subregions, labeled as PA1, PA2,\nPA31, PA32, and PA4, as shown in Figure 4, to investigate the relation between\nthe observed [O III](5007\u00c5)/H\u03b2 ratio and metallicity. Those regions are bright in\neach emission line and geometrically clustered in compact regions. The sizes of the\nregions are close to the size of the spectroscopic aperture used in BK02. In addition,\nPA1 and PA4 correspond to the regions, \"A\" and \"9\" in BK02, respectively.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nIn the P box, we can also observe a weak rank-ordering of the [O III]/H\u03b2 ratios\naccording to the regions they belong to : A1 > A2 > A3 \u2248 A4. Interestingly,\nthat is the exact order of distance from the center. This relation between the [O\nIII]/H\u03b2 ratios and the distance from the center appears consistent with the metallicity\ngradient from the center to the spiral arms in M83.\nTo verify this, we present the observed relation between oxygen abundance and\n[O III]/H\u03b2 ratios in Figure 7. The black (named \"MG\") and the grey (named \"E\")\npoints are borrowed from the spectroscopic results of BK02. The names \"MG\" and\n\"E\" indicate the different oxygen abundance calibrations from McGaugh (1991) and\nEdmunds (1989). The figure shows the direct correlation between [O III]/H\u03b2 ratio\nand oxygen abundance. To compare our data with those from BK02, we convert the\ndistance of each region to the oxygen abundance using the relation between distance\nand oxygen abundance in BK02 and overplot them in Figure 7. The horizontal error\nbar is due to the physical size of each region and the vertical error bar represents\nthe standard deviation of the line ratio distribution among the pixels within each\nregion. Since our resolution is much higher than the spectroscopic aperture, 0.2\u2032\u2032 for\neach pixel, the line ratios are distributed in a broad range for the A1, ..., A4 regions,\nas well as the PA1, ..., PA4 regions. The overall trend is consistent with the same\nmetallicity trend as BK02. So the metallicity gradient from center to spiral arm\nappears to cause the spread in [O III]/H\u03b2 values in the \"photo-ionized\" area of the\ndiagnostic diagram of Figure 6 at low [S II]/H\u03b1 values.\nTo investigate in detail the physical properties of the photo-ionized gas in M83,\nwe present additional photo-ionization models in Figure 8. The two top panels\nshow two different star formation history models; constant star formation (left) and\ninstantaneous burst (right) from K01. The constant star formation model assumes\ndurations larger than 8 Myr, when the dynamical balance between the stellar births\nand deaths is set up for UV radiation. The instantaneous burst model is the case for\nzero age stellar population, which is the extreme end in star formation history. Thus,\nthese two models bracket a range of star formation histories for our regions. Both\nshow similar metallicity dependence; lower [O III]/H\u03b2 ratio for higher metallicity.\nThe constant star formation model with 2.0 Z\u2299 marks the lower envelope to the\nphoto-ionized data, thus fully including all pixels in A1.\nDopita et al. (2006; hereafter DP06) introduced models for time-evolving H II\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nregion. While K01 treats the ionization parameter as an independent parameter,\nDP06 calculates the ionization parameter as a function of the age of the stellar\ncluster. The DP06 models are based on a one dimensional spherical geometry for the\nevolving H II region. The radius and pressure evolution are derived from the works\nof Castor et al. (1975) and Oey & Clarke (1997, 1998):\n250 \u00011/5 1/5 \u22121/5 3/5\nLmech \u03c10 t\n308\u03c0\n7\n2/5\n3/5\nP =\nLmech \u03c10 t\u22124/5\n2/5\n(3850\u03c0)\nR =\n\nwhere Lmech is the instantaneous mechanical luminosity from the cluster, \u03c10 is the\nambient ISM density, and t is the time. DP06 found that the ionization parameter\nin their models depends on the mass of the stellar cluster and the pressure of the\n1/5 \u22121/5\nsurrounding ISM, and it scales as q \u221d Mcl P0 , where Mcl is the initial mass of\nthe stellar cluster and P0 is the initial ISM pressure surrounding the stellar cluster.\nHence, the ratio, R= log10 [(Mcl /M\u2299 )/(P0 /k)] where P0 /k is measured in cgs units\n(cm\u22123 K), uniquely determines the time-evolving track of the ionization parameter\nas an initial condition (see DP06 for more details). The middle panels in Figure 8\nshow the DP06 models for two different metallicities, 1.0 Z\u2299 (left) and 2.0 Z\u2299 (right).\nWe also compare these models with re-binned data (see bottom panels of Figure 8)\nto investigate the impact of the binning size on our results. In all cases analyzed,\nwe find that an evolving HII region scenario at constant metallicity does not fully\nreproduce the observed trend in the data, although each covers a portion of the locus\noccupied by the data points. The full range of the data can be covered by varying\nthe metal abundance by more than a factor 10, which we consider unlikely given the\nrelative small size of our regions (\u2248970 pc). At this stage, the best model to fit the\nphoto\u2013ionized gas appears to be the continuous starburst scenario.\nThe instantaneous models assume zero-aged stellar population and DP06 models\ntrack the age effect on such instantaneous models using the evolution dynamics\ndescribed by the above equations. These two models are hard to reconcile with\nobservations if the stellar population contains a mix of stellar clusters with various\nages or if the ionization parameter can not be derived from the equations above.\nThose equations are exact only in the case of an isolated H II region. For a starburst\nregion, the photo-ionized gas is diffuse and distributed on a large scale plus the region\nitself is the complex superposition of many H II regions. For this case, the ionization\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nparameter is better treated as an independent parameter rather than derived from\nan isotropically expanding sphere. The age distribution of stellar clusters in M83\napproximately follows a power-law distribution (Chandar et al. 2010): there are\nmany clusters formed within 107 yrs, and the power-law extends by a few million\nyears. Therefore, the combination of multiple stellar population ages and complex\ngeometry of the photo-ionized gas can be the reasons why the continuous models fit\nthe observation more closely.\n\n3.2.\n\nTransition from Photo-ionization to Shock-ionization\n\nThe adopted separation criteria for the shock and photo-ionized gas need to be\ndiscussed in this kind of study, because there is no objective separation between the\ntwo phases in the diagnostic diagram. The maximum starburst line, or \"Photoionization Limit\" in Figure 6, is a conservative limit (see K01 and Kauffmann et al. 2003),\nabove and to the right of which line ratios can not be produced by photo-ionization.\nThis provides a lower limit to the amount of shock-ionized gas; in Table 2, we list,\nfor this discriminant (called M1), the H\u03b1 luminosity, fraction of the total luminosity,\nand fraction of the total area occupied by shocks. A second discriminant can be\nprovided by photo-ionization models matched to the solar-to-super-solar metallicity\nof M83. If we choose, conservatively, the N350Z1.0 model of Figure 6, the fraction of\nH\u03b1 luminosity and area occupied by shocks increases dramatically (M2 in Table 2).\nIn this case, even the H II regions located along the spiral arm outside the central region show evidence for a shock component, albeit at the level of \u2248 1%. Conversely, in\nthe central starburst, about 15% of the total H\u03b1 luminosity is due to shocks. A third\ndiscriminant (called M3) can be provided by shock-ionization models. Data points\nwill be considered shocks if they lie within the region covered by shock+precursor\nmodels. The M3 criterion is the most generous, among the three discussed so far, in\nincluding pixels from each region among the 'shocks', it will provide a robust upper\nlimit to our shock estimates. The shock H\u03b1 luminosity in the spiral arm regions is\nnow 4% (A3) or less of the total H\u03b1 luminosity, still is not a significant amount. A\nmuch larger fraction, about 33% of the total, is derived for the central starburst, the\nmost generous estimate among all criteria.\nFinally, as the low surface brightness of [O III](5007\u00c5) is the major limit-\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\ning factor for our diagnostics, we attempt to use the single line ratio criterion, [S\nII]/H\u03b1 > \u22120.5, to overcome this limitation (M4 in Table 2). This is another generous criterion for discriminating shocks from photo-ionization, like the M3 criterion,\nalthough it provides a less accurate separation than the diagnostic diagram involving\nthe [OIII] line; however, it does not suffer from the limitations produced by faint or\nundetected [O III](5007\u00c5). Figure 9 shows the theoretical relation between normalized H\u03b1 flux and [S II]/H\u03b1 ratio from the continuous starburst model of K01 and the\nshock+precursor model of A08. In this figure, we define three regions: (1) the shock\nzone, log([S II]/H\u03b1 )> \u22120.5, (2) the mixing zone, \u22121 < log([S II]/H\u03b1 ) < \u22120.5, and\n(3) the photo-ionization zone, log([S II]/H\u03b1 ) < \u22121. Our single-ratio diagnostics,\nlog([S II]/H\u03b1 ) > \u22120.5, thus contains contributions from photo-ionized gas at low\nsurface brightness. We consider this \"contamination\" acceptable, in view of the fact\nthat we recover all signal from shocks. Figure 10 shows the observed relation between\nthe dust extinction corrected H\u03b1 flux and the [S II]/H\u03b1 ratios for A1, A2, A3, and\nA4. The comparison of Figures 9 and 10 suggests that shocks are present in all four\nregions analyzed.\nIn Table 2, the SFR is calculated from the photo-ionized gas only; i.e. (total\nH\u03b1 luminosity - shock H\u03b1 luminosity), corrected for the effects of extinction using\nthe WFC3 P\u03b2(\u03bb1.282\u03bcm) image (Liu et al. 2011, in prep). The SFR density is\ncalculated by dividing the SFR by the area of the photo-ionized pixels. Figure 11\nshows the spatial distribution of the ionized gas from Table 2 according to each\nshock separation criterion, M1, M2, M3, and M4; the H\u03b1 images (4 \u03c3 cut) covering\nthe regions, A1, A2, A3, and A4, are shown in the first column together with the\nlocations of photo-ionized gas (red) and shock-ionized gas (blue) with the shock\ncriteria of M1(the second column), M2(the third column), M3(the fourth column),\nand M4(the fifth column).\nIn the spiral arm (regions A2, A3, A4), the shock gas from the \"Maximum\nStarburst Line\" criteria(M1) is negligible. In the other criteria(M2, M3, and M4),\nthe luminosity ratios and the area ratios are 4% or less. Figure 10 also shows that\nmost of the log([S II]/H\u03b1 ) values in A2, A3, and A4, are less than -1, so located in\nthe photo-ionization zone. Therefore, feedback from star formation is very low in the\nspiral arm of M83 perhaps owing to the youth of the H II regions we detect. Shocks\nremain a small or negligible component in the outer H II regions.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nFor the central starburst, the SFR is 2.7 times larger than the previous study\nof C04 due to a better H\u03b1 filter coverage in the present study (the WFPC2 narrowband filter used in the C04 study placed the redshifted H\u03b1 on the red shoulder of the\nfilter). In addition, the P\u03b2/H\u03b1 extinction map we use probes larger dust extinction\nvalues than the H\u03b1/H\u03b2 extinction map (Liu et al. 2011; in prep). The SFR density\nof A1 is 3 times larger than the values of A2, A3, and A4. For the conservative\nshock estimate(M1), the luminosity ratio and the area ratio of A1 are consistent\nwith the previous study of C04 when we consider the range of values for different\n[N II] corrections of the H\u03b1 filter. In this conservative criterion, a few percents of\nthe H\u03b1 luminosity comes from shock gas. The area occupied by the shock gas is\nlarger than the luminosity contribution, consistent with the fact that the shock gas\nhas lower H\u03b1 brightness but is distributed more diffusely than the photo-ionized\ngas. For the other criteria (M2, M3, and M4), the shock H\u03b1 luminosities can reach\n15% to 33% of the total luminosity. The covering areas of shocks are also larger\ntotaling 28% to 53% of the total area. The M3 and M4 criteria are generous, and\nmay misclassify as shocks some regions that could actually contain mostly photoionized gas; we thus expect the shock luminosity and area can be overestimated for\nM3 and M4. We conclude that the acceptable values are 15% for the H\u03b1 luminosity\nand 30% for the areal coverage of shocks in the center of M83. When comparing our\n15% fraction of shocked gas in the central starburst of M83 with expectations for\nthe mechanical energy output from the starburst itself (4% to 9%, columns 4 and 8\nof Table 6 in C04), we conclude that virtually all of the available mechanical energy\nfrom massive star winds and supernovae is radiated. This is in agreement with the\nfindings of Martin (2006), who conclude that only a few percent of the mechanical\nenergy from star formation is available as kinetic energy to drive the ISM.\n\n3.3.\n\nShock-ionized Gas\n\nIn this section, we compare our data with shock-ionization models and investigate the properties of the shock-ionized gas. The shock-ionization model of A08 uses\nthe ionizing radiation field from hot radiative shock layers dominated by free-free\nemission and the MAPPINGS III code to calculate the gas ionization state and the\nintensity of the emission lines. The emission from shocks consists of two components;\nthe shock layer (postshock component) and the precursor (preshock component). The\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nshock layer is the cooling zone of the radiative shock and the precursor is the region\nionized by the upstreaming photons from the cooling zone. Since free-free emission\nis dominant in shock layers, the ionizing radiation field from shocks is mainly determined by the shock velocity and the preshock gas density (see A08 for more details).\nSo for a given metallicity and pre\u2013shock gas density, the shock velocity is the main\nparameter determining the line ratios in the diagnostics. The main branch of the\nshock grids labeled with \"B=1.0E-4\" in Figure 6 shows the line ratios for shock velocities from 100 km/s to 900km/s, with a fixed ISM magnetic field of 10\u22124\u03bcG . The\nmagnetic field in the ISM plays an important role in determining the post-shock gas\ndensity: higher ISM magnetic fields correspond to lower post-shock densities, with\nmajor effects on the ionization parameter of the post-shock gas component. Hence,\nthe magnetic field is the second main parameter in shock models. The side branches\nfrom the selected shock velocities, 100, 150, ..., 500 km/s, show the effect of changing\nthe magnetic fields from 10\u22124 \u03bcG to 10\u03bcG. The metallicity of the model is 2Z\u2299 and\nthe preshock gas density is 1 cm\u22123 .\nTwo peculiar features can be identified in Figure 6, in the region dominated by\nshock-excitation. One is a series of pixels in a roughly horizontal sequence, around\nlog([O III]/H\u03b2 ) \u223c 0, which seem to be consistent with the horizontal feature of the\nshock+precursor model from A08. This horizontal distribution of shock-ionized gas\nis a unique feature when compared with other solar and sub-solar abundant galaxies\nsuch as NGC3077, NGC4214, and NGC5253 in C04, which have the shock-ionized\ngas near or outside of the \"Maximum Starburst Line\". A part of the feature is\nmarked by a box labeled 'S2' in the figure, where it is outside of the photo-ionization\nlocus. So, the 'S2' region can be considered as a shock-ionized region with high shock\nvelocities (> 300 km/s) according to the shock models. The other peculiar feature is\na vertical plume located at log([O III]/H\u03b2 ) > 0.2 and \u22121 < log([S II]/H\u03b1 ) < \u22120.5,\nwhere some low velocity shocks are likely to be present based on the shock models.\nThis region, also marked by a box in Figure 6, is labeled 'S1'. Both regions belong to\nthe nuclear region A1, where the most active star formation in the galaxy is taking\nplace.\nThe horizontal feature around S2 in the diagnostic diagram is highlighted in\nFigure 12, where the data are compared with: the shock+precursor models from\nA08 (top-left panel), and the precursor and the shock shown as separate curves, also\nfrom A08 (top-right panel). To assess again the impact of spatial sampling on our\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\ndata, we reproduce the top panel with the data rebinned in boxes of 35x35 pixels, or\n1.4\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 1.4\u2032\u2032 (bottom panels). The models clearly indicate somewhat different natures\nfor the horizontal feature. The A08 models suggest that the feature could be due\nto shocks-only or shock+precursor (but not precursor-only model), with velocities\nin the range 250-350 km/s. The pixels corresponding to the S2 data points in the\ndiagnostic diagram of Figure 13 are re-projected onto a spatial reproduction of A1 in\nthe left panel of Figure 13. Those points are mostly located at the edges of the region\nof photo-ionization, where we would expect to find shock-ionized gas. In addition,\nmany S2 points are located inside the largest of the regions in A1, in correspondence\nof the 'bubble' created by one or more of the young stellar clusters in the starburst\n(Harris et al., 2001); this is also an area where we do expect shocks to be present.\nRegion S1 in Figure 6 is enlarged in the right panel of Figure 13, and its pixels\nspatially projected in the left panel of the same figure. A number of those data\npoints from the diagnostic diagram, especially those with the highest log([O III]/H\u03b2 ),\ndistribute randomly on the spatial projection, indicating that they are the result of\nnoisy pixels combined with our generous 4 sigma cut in the line emission images.\nHowever, a number of pixels in the S1 region appear correlated, and, like most of\nthe pixels from S2, crowded in regions at the edges of the A1 line emission area. We\nname those regions S1a(magenta), S1b(cyan), and S1c(grey), indicated with open\ncircles in the left panel, and identify those regions in the diagnostic diagram in the\nright panel of Figure 13. Those data points, marked with circles in the right panel\nof the figure, are consistent with low velocity shocks+precursor models by A08, with\nvelocity in the range 100\u2013150 km/s. These areas (also marked with open circles in\nthe left panel of Figure 13) are located close to identified supernova remnants (SNRs)\nfrom Dopita et al. (2010) as shown in the bottom of Figure 13. Using the naming\nconvention from that paper, we find SNRs N3,N4, and N7 close to our region S1a,\nN2 to S1b, and N14, N15, N17, and N18 to S1c. S1a and S2b seem to correspond\nto the SNRs, N3 and N2, respectively. There is no corresponding SNR for S1c. It\nis interesting that S1c is surrounded by the four SNRs, N14, N15, N17, and N18.\nHowever, 4 SNRs, N14, N15, N17 and N18 are located in correspondence of feature\nboth in S1 and S2 (top left with bottom panel of Figure 13). Thus, it is likely that\nthe identified low-velocity shocks are closely related to the identified SNRs.\nTwo of the S1 subregions (S1a and S1b) are located adjacent to the dust lane\nthat crosses the center of M83. Although the diagnostic diagram tends to be fairly\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nunaffected by dust extinction, the large dust column densities found in dust lanes\nmay have an impact on the line ratios. We can not eliminate this possibility with\nthe data in hand. Finally, dynamical interactions may play a role in the creation\nof low velocity shocks. S1a and S1c are located at the junction points of the spiral\narms to the central outer ring, while S1b is in\u2013between the spiral arm and the outer\nring. The interaction between those morphological features could be at the basis of\nthe observed shocks.\nThe width of the precursor of a shock front is generally larger than our binned\npixel size(\u223c 4.3pc), while photo-ionization equilibrium can be achieved well within\nthe size. For the shock model of A08 with solar abundance, 1 cm\u22123 preshock gas\ndensity, 200 km/s shock velocity, and 3.2 \u03bcG magnetic field, the length of preshock\nionized zone is 40 pc, while the length of postshock cooling zone is less than 4 pc.\nEven though the postshock zone (shock layer) can be small enough to fit in our\nbin size, the preshock component is much larger than our bin scale. This means\nthat , unlike the photo-ionization model, the shock-ionization model needs to be\napplied carefully when we compare it with the data. For instance, if a pixel lineof-sight passes through both of precursor and shock front, the pixel line ratio is\nmeaningful when compared with the shock+precursor grids. If a pixel only covers\na part of the precursor region or shock front, the comparison has to be made with\nshock-only or precursor-only models. When we consider the complicated geometry\nthrough observed line-of-sights, it is hard to determine which light-of-sight is for\nshock-only, precursor-only or shock+precursor. Therefore, we may need to make a\ngeometrical block enough to cover both of shock and precursor, but excluding photoionized gas, and sum up the whole line flux in the block in order to compare it\nwith the shock+precursor model. So basically shock-ionization models may need, in\nprinciple, to be compared on a large-scale basis than what done so far. However, as\nshown in the bottom panels of both Figures 8 and 12, rebinned to pixel sizes of 1.4\u2032\u2032\n(\u223c30 pc), the quantitative distribution of the data points on the diagnostic diagram\ndoes not change, implying that our smaller pixel scale is adequate to average out\neffects of spatial variations in shocks.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n4.\n\nSummary\n\nWe have presented emission line diagnostic diagrams for the central \u223c4 kpc of\nthe nearby starburst galaxy M83, using the newly available WFC3 images in order\nto investigate the properties and morphology of both the photo-ionized and shockionized gas on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Here is the summary of our results:\n1. A comparison of the data with a number of photo- and shock-ionization\nmodels show that the best fit for the data of the central starburst region (A1 in our\nconvention) is given by a combination of the Z=2 Z\u2299 photo\u2013ionization models of K01\nand the shock+precursor models of A08.\n2. Regions at increasing galactocentric distance show an increasing [O III]/H\u03b2 ratio\nfor the photo\u2013ionized gas, consistent with the presence of a metallicity gradient in\nthe galaxy.\n3. Changing the discriminating 'line' between shocks and photo\u2013ionized gas has\nmajor implications for the fraction of ionized gas that can be attributed to shocks.\nThe Maximum Starburst Line of K01 (the most conservative criterion for identifying\nshocks; See Kauffmann et al. 2003) produces fractions of a few percent, in agreement\nwith previous results (e.g., C04). Adopting a metallicity\u2013dependent criterion, the\nfraction of shock\u2013ionized H\u03b1 luminosity increases to about 15%, and is in any case\nno larger than about 33% in the starburst center, while shocks are always negligible\nin the spiral area H II regions. At the 15% level, this requires that virtually all the\nmechanical energy produced in the starburst center is radiated away in the shocks.\n4. We find three regions dominated by low velocity shocks. All three are located\nat the edges of the central starburst, and can have one of three possible origins: a)\ncan be the result of feedback from SNRs located near each component; b) can be\ndue to the dynamical interaction between the center and the spiral arm; c) could be\nthe result of the extreme local dust extinction. Discriminating among these three\nscenarios will require additional more sophisticated observations.\nWe are grateful to an anonymous referee for comments that have improved\nthis paper.

Since the PA regions are chosen for their\nbrightness and compactness relative to A1,..., and A4, the higher [O III]/H\u03b2 ratios\nin A1,..., and A4, can be due to gas that is too faint and diffuse for spectroscopic\nstudy.\n\n\f\u2013 32 \u2013\n\nContinuous Starburst Models\n\nlog([O III]/H\u03b2)\n\n1\n\nInstantaneous Starburst Models\nN350Z1.0\nN10Z1.0\n\nN350Z1.0\nN10Z1.0\n\n0\nN350Z2.0\nN350Z2.0\n\n-1\n\nN10Z2.0\nN10Z2.0\n\nlog([O III]/H\u03b2)\n\n1\n\nTime Evolving HII Region 1.0 Z\u2299\n\nTime Evolving HII Region 2.0 Z\u2299\n\nR=+2,0,-2,-4,-6\nR=+2\n\nR=+2,0,-2,-4,-6\nR=+2\n\n0\nR=-6\n\n1.0 Myr\n\n-1\n\n0.5 Myr\nR=-6\n\n1.5 Myr\n\nlog([O III]/H\u03b2)\n\n1\n\n1.0 Myr\n\nTime Evolving HII Region 1.0 Z\u2299\n\nTime Evolving HII Region 2.0 Z\u2299\n\nR=+2,0,-2,-4,-6\nR=+2\n\nR=+2,0,-2,-4,-6\nR=+2\n\n0\nR=-6\n\n1.0 Myr\n\n-1\n\n0.5 Myr\nR=-6\n\n1.5 Myr\n\n-2\n\n1.0 Myr\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\nlog([S II]/H\u03b1)\n\nlog([S II]/H\u03b1)\n\n0\n\nFig. 8.- Top: The continuous starburst models (left) and the instantaneous starburst models (right) of K01.
