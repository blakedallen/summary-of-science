LSDA calculations correctly describe the\nmetallic behavior as well as the anisotropic magnetic ordering pattern of C type: The high Cr valence\nstate induces via sizeable pd hybridization remarkably strong next-nearest neighbor interactions\nstabilizing this ordering. The subtle balance of magnetic interactions gives rise to magneto-elastic\ncoupling, explaining pronounced structural anomalies observed at the magnetic ordering transition.\n\nStrongly correlated electron systems including the wide\nclass of transition-metal oxides exhibit a quite general\nrelation between magnetic order and electrical conductivity [1]: ferromagnetism typically coexists with metallic conductivity, whereas insulators usually exhibit antiferromagnetism. It is always a challenge to understand\nexceptions from this rule. The rare observations of ferromagnetism in insulating transition-metal oxides most\noften are due to a particular type of orbital ordering [2].\nThe few examples of antiferromagnetic (AFM) metals,\ne.g., (La/Sr)3 Mn2 O7 [3] or Ca3 Ru2 O7 [4], are characterized by reduced electronic and structural dimensionality,\nand the antiferromagnetic order corresponds to a stacking of ferromagnetic (FM) layers. Here we report the discovery of a three-dimensional transition-metal oxide with\nmetallic conductivity, antiferromagnetic exchange interactions, and C-type antiferromagnetic order: the perovskite CaCrO3.\nPerovskites containing Cr4+ (CaCrO3 , SrCrO3 , and\nPbCrO3 ) were already studied previously [5, 6, 7, 8, 9,\n10], but neither the details of the crystal structure nor\nthe nature of the magnetic ordering are known. Only\nvery recently evidence for C-type AFM order was reported in multi-phase samples of SrCrO3 [10]. Regarding\nthe conductivity, the existing data are controversial. In\nRefs. [7, 9] CaCrO3 was claimed to be metallic, but more\nrecently insulating behavior has been reported [5]. A similar controversy persists also for SrCrO3 , which should\ndefinitely be more metallic than CaCrO3 due to the less\ndistorted crystal structure, but metallic behavior was observed in Ref. [5] only under pressure. These controversies most likely are connected with the difficulty to prepare high-quality stoichiometric materials and with the\nlack of large single crystals.\nCaCrO3 exhibits an orthorhombic GdFeO3 -type perovskite structure and early magnetization measurements\n\nindicate a magnetic transition at 90 K [8], which is confirmed in our samples. Two electrons occupy the Cr 3d\nshell (S=1), rendering the material electronically similar to insulating RVO3 [11] (also 3d2 ) and to metallic\n(Ca/Sr)RuO3 (4d2 ) [12]. CaCrO3 shows an unusually\nhigh transition-metal valence, Cr4+ , which may lead to\na small or even negative charge-transfer gap [13, 14],\ni.e., holes in the O band. In CrO2 with rutile structure\nand edge-sharing CrO6 octahedra, the negative chargetransfer gap leads to self-doping [15] and to the appearance of a ferromagnetic metallic state. In contrast, the\nlayered perovskite Sr2 CrO4 with corner-sharing octahedra and \u223c 180\u25e6 Cr-O-Cr bonds is an AFM Mott-Hubbard\ninsulator with a gap of about 0.2 eV [16].\nCombining diffraction, macroscopic and infrared reflectivity measurements with LSDA as well as with LSDA+U\ncalculations we have studied the properties of CaCrO3 .\nWe find that CaCrO3 is an antiferromagnetic metallic\ntransition-metal oxide with a C-type magnetic structure. According to LSDA calculations, the magnetic\norder arises from competing nearest-neighbor (nn) and\nnext-nearest-neighbor (nnn, \"diagonal\") exchange interactions, which result from a sizeable pd hybridization.\nRemarkably, the magnetic transition at T=90 K causes\npronounced anomalies in structural and transport properties.\nPolycrystalline CaCrO3 was prepared by a solid state\nreaction of CaO and CrO2 under 4 GPa at 1000oC for 30\nminutes. The obtained samples of stoichiometric reactions always include a varying amount of the impurities\nof Cr2 O3 and CaCr2 O4 . This impurity problem has also\nbeen reported by Goodenough et al. [8]. A small excess\nof CaO (5-10%), however, almost completely eliminated\nthese impurities, and the excess CaO could be washed\nout with distilled water. Close inspection showed that\nsingle-crystalline grains of up to 0.1mm diameter were\n\n\f2\n216\n214\n\nbcub\n\n212\n\n3.76\n\n3\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\nV (\u00c5 )\n\n3.78\n\n210\n\n3.74\n\n0\n\nacub\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n0\n\n(c)\n\n-1\n-2\n\n3.72\n0\n\n-3\n\nccub\n200\n\n400\n\nT (K)\n\n600\n\n800\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n1000 \u03b5\n\nLattice parameter (\u00c5)\n\nobtained by this procedure as well. Powder neutron measurements were performed on the SPODI diffractometer\nat the FRM-II reactor (\u03bb = 1.548\u00c5) as well as on the D20\nhigh-flux diffractometer at the ILL (\u03bb = 2.4233\u00c5). Lattice parameters have been studied with synchrotron radiation at the beamline B2 at Hasylab/DESY (\u03bb = 0.75\u00c5)\nusing an image plate detector for temperatures between\n15 K and 1063 K. At about 710 K a starting sample decomposition, however, allowed us to obtain reliable data\nonly up to \u223c800 K. X-ray single-crystal structure analysis\nwas performed on a Bruker X8-Apex diffractometer using Mo-K\u03b1 radiation between 90 K and 300 K. Although\nthe sample showed a superposition of six different twindomain orientations, a satisfactory intensity integration\nwas achieved due to the low splitting of the pseudo-cubic\nparameters. Final R-values referring to the intensities\nwere between 2 and 4%. This experiment confirms the\nclose to perfect stoichiometry of our samples. The electrical resistivity \u03c1(T ) was measured by an AC four-point\nmethod on a pellet of CaCrO3 powder which was coldpressed at 12.5 kbar. The infrared reflectivity R(\u03c9) of a\ncold-pressed pellet was determined between 7 meV and\n0.9 eV using a Bruker IFS 66v/S Fourier-transform spectrometer. For the reference measurement we used in-situ\nAu evaporation. The real part \u03c31 (\u03c9) of the optical conductivity has been obtained via a Kramers-Kronig analysis, for which R(\u03c9) has been extrapolated to lower and\nhigher frequencies using a conventional Drude-Lorentz\nfit.\nThe lattice parameters of CaCrO3 determined by\nsynchrotron-radiation powder diffraction are shown in\nFig. 1. All three orthorhombic parameters exhibit a\nstep-like anomaly at the magnetic ordering temperature\ndetermined by the SQUID susceptibility and neutron\ndiffraction measurements, TN =90 K. Although the sudden changes in the lattice constants are rather strong, up\nto 0.5% for c, there is no visible effect in the lattice volume. Whereas c shrinks, a and b elongate upon cooling,\nyielding a flattening of the P bnm structure. We emphasize that there is no evidence for phase mixture apart\nvery close to TN . Close inspection of the temperature\ndependence suggests that this lattice flattening already\nstarts at much higher temperatures.\nThe neutron powder and the x-ray single-crystal experiments give the full structural information including the\npositional and the displacement parameters, from which\nall bond angles and distances can be calculated. The\nresults are given in Fig. 2. The GdFeO3 -type structure\n(space group P bnm) develops out of the ideal perovskite\nstructure by rotating, angle \u03a6, and tilting, angle \u0398, the\nCrO6 octahedra [17]. Between 3.5 and 300 K, \u0398 = 10.5\u25e6\nand \u03a6 = 8.2\u25e6 are nearly constant, reflecting a sizeable\nstructural distortion. The combination of tilt and rotation yields two distinct O positions: apical O1 out-ofplane and O2 in the ab plane. Regarding a distortion\nof the basal plane of the octahedron, we do not find a\nsplitting in the Cr-O2 distances but a weak temperature\nindependent elongation of the octahedron parallel to a,\n\n-4\n800\n\nT (K)\n\nFIG. 1: a) Orthorhombic lattice parameters a, b, and\u221a c,\nscaled to \u221a\nthe parameter of a cubic perovskite: acub = a/ 2,\nbcub = b/ 2 and ccub = c/2. b) and c) show the orthorhombic splitting \u03b5 and the lattice volume V . Circles refer to synchrotron and triangles to neutron diffraction results.\n\ni.e. the O2-O2 edges are different (see Fig. 2). In addition, we find an overall flattening of the octahedron\nfollowing the flattening of the lattice at TN : The Cr-O1\n(Cr-O2) distance shrinks (elongates) upon cooling. The\ncompression of the octahedron points to a temperaturedriven redistribution amongst the t2g orbitals increasing\nthe dxy occupation upon cooling into the magnetically\nordered state. In electronically similar Ca2 RuO4 , a similar flattening of the octahedron has been attributed to\na pronounced orbital rearrangement [18, 19], but there\nthe effects are about an order of magnitude larger than\nin CaCrO3.\nBelow TN =90 K two strong magnetic peaks emerge\nat (100) and (102)/(012) which can unambiguously be\nattributed to Cy -type AFM order, see Fig. 2. Other\nschemes do not yield the correct peak positions or fail\nto describe the intensity ratio. In space group P bnm the\nCy -type order may couple with Fx and Gz components\naccording to the irreducible representation \u03932g [20]. The\nFx component perfectly agrees with the observation of\nweak ferromagnetism in the susceptibility, see Fig. 2b).\nWe find a sizeable ordered moment of 1.2\u03bcB at low temperature, which, however, is much below the expected\nvalue for a S=1 moment.\nThe resistivity \u03c1(T ) exhibits \u2202\u03c1/\u2202T < 0 and a rather\nsmall value at 300 K, 0.1\u03a9m (see inset of Fig. 3). Furthermore, \u03c1(T ) does not diverge towards low T but tends\nto a finite value. Upon a first cooling cycle we find a\nclear jump at TN most likely due to cracks caused by the\npronounced structural anomalies. A similar jump was observed close to 90 K in \u03c1(T ) of a metallic single crystal [9],\nsuggesting that this sample exhibits a fully comparable\nmagnetic transition and thus can be considered to represent stoichiometric CaCrO3 .

However, the frequency dependence deviates\nstrongly from a typical Drude behavior. The spectral\nweight is almost entirely dominated by a peak at about\n350 meV. An increase of \u03c31 (\u03c9) with decreasing frequency\nis recovered only below 30 meV at 20 K. Although \u03c31 (\u03c9)\nappears to be dominated by excitations with finite frequency, we emphasize that R(\u03c9) unambigously demonstrates the presence of free carriers. This further agrees\nwith the magnetic susceptibility which, above TN is very\nsmall and hardly temperature dependent indicating itin-\n\nerant magnetism, see Fig. 2b).\nIn the case of insulating grain boundaries, \u03c31 (\u03c9) is\nsuppressed at low frequencies. However, this can not explain the peak observed at 350 meV. In our samples of\nCaCrO3 , the typical grain size is of the order of 20 \u03bcm.\nSince a wavelength of \u03bb = 20 \u03bcm is equivalent to a photon energy of \u223c 60 meV, grain-size effects can become\nimportant only much below 350 meV [21]. We attribute\nthe peak at 0.35 eV to excitations from the lower (LHB)\nto the upper (UHB) Hubbard band. Due to the high valence of Cr4+ , the Cr Hubbard bands shift down towards\nthe fully occupied O-2p band, whereas the pd hybridization between Cr and O bands pushes the LHB back upwards, reducing the effective Coulomb repulsion Ueff [22]\nand admixing O-2p states to the LHB and the UHB in\nthe same way as it was demonstrated for CrO2 [15]. In\ninsulating Sr2 CrO4 with Cr4+ in a d2 configuration [16],\nthis LHB-UHB excitation was observed at 1.0 eV. Integrating \u03c31 (\u03c9) from 7 meV to 0.9 eV in CaCrO3 yields\nan effective carrier density N \u2248 0.1 per Cr ion. Remarkably, this is very similar to the spectral weight of the\nLHB-UHB peak in Sr2 CrO4 [16]. From a conventional\nDrude-Lorentz fit we estimate that the spectral weight\nof the free-carrier Drude contribution is about 5% of the\ntotal weight at 20 K. Apparently, CaCrO3 is very close to\nlocalized-itinerant crossover. Its metallic behavior compared to insulating Sr2 CrO4 should be a consequence of\nthe three-dimensional crystal structure inducing larger\nband widths and thus smaller Ueff .\nTo further analyze the electronic structure, we carried\nout ab-initio band structure calculations for the T=3.5 K\ncrystal structure within the LSDA approximation using\nthe linear muffin-tin orbitals method [23]. Exchange constants were computed from the total energies of different\nmagnetic solutions, using the crystal structure presented\n\n\f4\nabove. In LSDA, CaCrO3 is metallic in all studied magnetic structures: FM, AFM-G (all nn spins antiparallel),\nAFM-A (AFM coupled FM ab planes) and two AFM-C\ntypes with FM chains running in different directions. In\nagreement with experiment, the AFM-C structure with\nFM chains running along c exhibits the lowest energy.\nThe calculated magnetic moment is \u03bc = 1.52\u03bcB /Cr, in\ngood agreement with the measured value of 1.2 \u03bcB . The\nreduction from 2\u03bcB expected for Cr4+ (S = 1) is caused\nby the strong pd hybridization.\nStudying the exchange parameters allows one to understand the apparently anisotropic magnetic structure. We\nfind a strong AFM interaction between nn spins within\nthe ab plane, J = 80 K, for the notation of magnetic\ninteractions see Fig. 2a). Surprisingly, also the nn exchange along c is AFM and only slightly smaller, J \u2032 =\n60 K, although the experiment finds FM coupling in this\ndirection. Its cause resides in a remarkably strong AFM\nnnn interaction along the diagonal, J \u2032\u2032 = 33 K. Since\nJ \u2032 < 4J \u2032\u2032 , the AFM J \u2032 is overruled yielding the C-type\nstructure. Thus, the anisotropic magnetic structure develops due to strong and anisotropic nnn interactions despite nearly isotropic nn interactions. Also the diagonal\nnnn exchange within the ab planes is AFM, Jdab = 22 K,\nbut not sufficient to overrule the nn J. The subtle balance of different interactions may give rise to strong magnetoelastic coupling, explaining the pronounced structural anomalies at TN . The flattening of the octahedron\nenhances the dxy occupation thereby increasing J and more importantly - decreasing J \u2032 . Note that magnetic\ninteractions in the LSDA approach are due to the band\nmagnetism of itinerant electrons. Therefore, the rather\nlarge diagonal coupling parameters are caused by strong\npd hybridization.\nTo check the importance of electronic correlations, we\nalso performed LSDA+U calculations [24] with on-site\nCoulomb interaction U = 3 eV and Hund's rule coupling\nJH = 0.87 eV [15]. Also in LSDA+U the ground state\nis C-type AFM, but the electronic state is very different.\nIn LSDA+U, CaCrO3 is an insulator with a gap of Eg \u223c\n0.5 eV (note that LSDA+U tends to overestimate Eg ). In\nthe LSDA+U approach, the C-type magnetic structure\nis associated with orbital ordering: one electron localizes\nin the xy orbital at each Cr site and provides the in-plane\nAFM \u221a\ninteraction, the second\n\u221a electron occupies alternating 1/ 2(xz +yz) and 1/ 2(xz \u2212yz) orbitals. According\nto the Goodenough-Kanamori-Anderson rules this causes\na FM interaction along c. This state is very similar to\nthe one reported for insulating YVO3 with G-type orbital order causing C-type magnetism [11, 25]. We have\nsearched for the orbital-order superstructure reflections\nin CaCrO3 by high-flux powder neutron diffraction but\ndid not find them although superstructure reflections 103\ntimes weaker than a strong fundamental reflection would\nhave been observed. Furthermore, a free refinement of\nthe orbital-order model with the high resolution SPODI\ndata does not yield any evidence for orbital ordering. We\n\nmay thus exclude an orbital order comparable to that\nin YVO3 for CaCrO3 . LSDA+U evidently does not describe CaCrO3 properly, but we nevertheless think that\nelectronic correlations are important in CaCrO3 driving\nit close to a metal-insulator cross-over.\nSummarizing our comprehensive investigation, combining diffraction, macroscopic and optical studies, we\nconclude that CaCrO3 is a metallic and antiferromagnetic transition-metal oxide. There are other metallic antiferromagnetic oxides known, but these exhibit\na reduced electronic and structural dimensionality rendering CaCrO3 unique. The anisotropic C-type magnetic structure is explained by frustrating nnn (diagonal) interactions. Apparently, the magnetic interactions\nin CaCrO3 are governed by sizeable pd hybridization,\na generic consequence of the high oxidation state associated with a small or negative charge transfer gap.\nThis work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through SFB 608 and by the Dynasty Foundation and via projects RFFI-07-02-00041, INTAS 05109-4727, CRDF Y4-P-05-15 and MK-1184.2007.2.\n\n[1] J.
