Among them, the GRAAL collaboration reported a new nucleon\nresonance N \u2217 (1675) from \u03b7 photoproduction [2, 3]1 . Their data show a narrow peak of\nwhich decay width \u0393N \u2217 \u2192\u03b7N was estimated to be about 40 MeV. After the Fermi-motion\ncorrection being taken into account, the width may become even narrower \u223c 10 MeV [5].\nThis narrow width is a typical feature for the pentaquark exotic baryons [6, 7, 8]. Moreover,\nthe production process of the N \u2217 (1675) largely depends on its isospin state of the target\nnucleons: A larger N \u2217 (1675) peak is shown for the neutron target, while it is suppressed\nfor the proton one. Considering the fact that isospin-symmetry breaking is negligible at the\nstrongly interacting vertex, this large asymmetry comes mainly from the photon coupling.\nInterestingly, N \u2217 (1675) being assumed as a member of the baryon antidecuplet (10), this\nlarge isospin asymmetry was well explained in the chiral quark-soliton model (\u03c7QSM) [9,\n10]. In fact, it originates from the U -spin conservation in the photon coupling [11]. This\nassymetry was emphasized once again experimentally in Ref. [12]. Recently, the Tohoku\nLNS [13] and CB-ELSA [14] reported \u03b7 photoproduction from the deuteron target, providing\nthe same conclusion on that behavior. Concerning the spin and parity, their assignments\nare not yet determined unambiguously. Although the \u03b7-MAID has assumed J P = 1/2+ as\nsuggested by the \u03c7QSM [5], in our previous work [15], we have shown that J P = 1/2\u2212 was\nequally possible in comparison with the experimental data.\nIn the present work, following Ref. [15], we would like to present a recent study on the \u03b7\nphotoproduction employing the effective Lagrangian approach in the Born approximation.\nWe include six nucleon resonances D13 (1520), S11 (1535), S11 (1650), D15 (1675), P11 (1710),\nP13 (1720) in a fully relativistic manner. We ignore the contributions from N \u2217 (1680, 5/2)\nand N \u2217 (1700, 3/2) considered in Ref. [5] since their branching ratios to the \u03b7N channel are\nnegligible. Nucleon pole terms and vector-meson exchanges are also taken into account as\nbackgrounds. In order to test the spin and parity of the new resonance, we investigate\nthe different four cases, J P = 1/2\u00b1 , 3/2\u00b1 . We utilize the phenomenological form factors in\nterms of a gauge-invariant manner as done in Ref. [15, 16, 17]. As a result, we observe that\n\u03bc\u03b3nn\u2217 (1675) = 0.1 \u223c 0.2 and \u03bc\u03b3pp\u2217 (1675) ' 0 for J P = 1/2\u00b1 whereas \u03bc\u03b3nn\u2217 (1675) = 0.01 \u223c 0.02\nand \u03bc\u03b3pp\u2217 (1675) ' 0 for J P = 3/2\u00b1 to reproduce the GRAAL data qualitatively well. Here,\n\u03bc\u03b3N N \u2217 (1675) denotes the strengths of either magnetic or electric coupling between N and\nN \u2217 (1675). The present study seems to prefer the nucleon resonance of J P = 1/2\u00b1 , but the\npossibility of higher spin can not be completely excluded.\nThe present work is organized as follows: In Section II, we provide our formalisms for \u03b7\nphotoproduction. Differential cross sections and beam asymmetry being compared to the\nGRAAL data are given in Section III and Section IV, respectively, with discussions. Final\nsection is devoted for summary and conclusion.\n1\n\nRecent analysis has shown that the mass of the new resonance is about 1.68 GeV [4].\n\n2\n\n\fFIG. 1: Relevant tree-level diagrams for \u03b7 photoproduction.\nII.\n\nFORMALISM\n\nIn this section, we present our model for \u03b7 photoproduction. In Figure 1 we show the\nrelevant tree-level diagrams for it schematically. The diagrams represent nucleon-pole (top)\nand resonance (middle) contributions in s- (left) and u-channels (right). In addition we also\nconsider vector-meson exchanges (\u03c1 and \u03c9) in t-channel (bottom). The nucleon-pole and\nvector-meson exchange terms are assigned as the background contributions. The effective\nLagrangians for the Yukawa vertices for the background contributions can be written as\nfollows:\ne\u03baN\nL\u03b3N N = \u2212eN\u0304 /AN \u2212 i\nN\u0304 \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd q \u03bd A\u03bc N + h.c.,\n2MN\nL\u03b7N N = \u2212ig\u03b7N N N\u0304 \u03b35 \u03b7N + h.c.,\ngt\nLV N N = \u2212gVv N N N\u0304 /V N \u2212 i V N N N\u0304 \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd q \u03bd V \u03bc N + h.c..,\n2MN\neg\u03b3\u03b7V\nL\u03b3\u03b7V =\n\u000f\u03bc\u03bd\u03c3\u03c1 F \u03bc\u03bd V \u03c3\u03c1 \u03b7 + h.c.,\n(1)\n4M\u03b7\nwhere \u03b3, N , \u03b7 and V stand for the fields of photon, nucleon, \u03b7 meson and vector mesons\n(\u03c1 and \u03c9), respectively. The e and \u03baN denote the electric charge and anomalous magnetic\nmoment of the nucleon, respectively. Mh denotes the mass of the hadron h.

[22, 23]. In the present work, we set the off-shell parameters to be zero for simplicity.\nThis choice, however, not bad, since resonance contributions become important only near\ntheir on-mass shells. The parity of the resonances are controlled by the matrices \u0393a5 and \u0393b5 :\nPositive parity : \u0393a5 = 14\u00d74 , \u0393b5 = \u03b35 ,\nNegative parity : \u0393a5 = \u03b35 , \u0393b5 = 14\u00d74 .\n\n(5)\n\nWe determine the strengths of the strong couplings for the resonance of spin n/2 (n =\n1, 3, 5) using the decay width \u0393N \u2217 \u2192\u03b7N as input:\n\uf8ee\nn/2\ng\u03b7N N \u2217\n\n=\n\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\n\uf8f91\n2\n\n2(n + 1) \u03c0MN \u2217 M\u03b7n\u22121\nCn2 |Pf |n\n\n\u0010q\n\nMN2 + |P\u03b7N |2 \u2212 \u03a0 sin\n\n\u0010\n\nn\u03c0\n2\n\n\u0011\n\nMN\n\n\uf8fa\n\u0011 \u0393N \u2217 \u2192\u03b7N \uf8fb\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nCnqstandsqfor the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the spin transition N \u2192 N \u2217 where C1,3,5 =\n1, 2/3, 2/5.

In Table II we list all phenomenological input for the\n< Ecm < 1.9\nstrong and electromagnetic couplings for the relevant resonances in 1.7 GeV \u223c\n\u223c\nGeV. Note that all the strong coupling strengths are determined in order to reproduce\nthe total and differential cross section data for the proton target [34] without the new\nresonance, since it was already shown in our previous work [15] that the contribution from\np\u2217 (1675) was negligible. We also fixed the photon couplings from the helicity amplitudes,\nlisted in Table II [24]. However, as for F15 (1680), we take relatively small values for the\nproton but large ones for the neutron, respectively, in order to obtain our numerical results\ncompatible to the experimental data of Ref. [2, 3]. Note that we have excluded D13 (1700)\nconsidering its negligible branching ratio decaying to \u03b7N . We note that the branching ratio\nfor D15 (1675) is much smaller than that used in the usual \u03b7-MAID analyses \u223c 17% [5]. We\nuse \u0393N \u2217 (1675) ' 40 MeV and \u0393N \u2217 (1675) /\u0393N \u2217 (1675)\u2192\u03b7N ' 0.25 for the new resonance as done in\nthe previous work [15]. This choice is also equivalent to take the Fermi-motion correction\ninto account, resulting in the smearing of the decay width [25].\nThe invariant amplitudes at the tree level can be evaluated straightforwardly using the\neffective Lagrangians given in Eqs.

As indicated in Ref. [16, 17], we use the\nsimplified form for the spin-3/2 propagator as given in Eq. (11), since this form dominates\nthe low energy region. Similarly, as for the spin-5/2 propagator, we consider the dominant\ncontribution only.\nConsidering the extended structure of the hadrons (h), we introduce a phenomenological\nform factor for the resonance and background contributions in a gauge-invariant manner [26,\n27, 28, 29]:\n\u039b4\nFxh =\n2\n\u039b4 + (x \u2212 Mh2 )\n\"\n\n6\n\n#m\n\n,\n\n(12)\n\n\fwhere x denotes the kinematical channel as well as the Mandelstem variables (s, u, t). The\npower m is chosen to be unity for the spin-1/2 and -3/2 cases, and two for the spin-5/2 ones.\nThis choice enables us to reduce unphysical behavior (monotonically increasing behavior\nbeyond Ecm \u223c MN \u2217 ) from the spin-5/2 propagator 2 . To satisfy gauge invariance and\nnormalization condition of the form factor, we parameterize the form factor Fc as follows [26,\n27, 28, 29]:\nFc = Fsh + Fuh \u2212 Fsh Fuh .\n\n(13)\n\nWe note that the amplitudes for the vector-meson exchange and resonant contributions are\ngauge invariant. The cuf-off masses are determined such that the data are well produced:\n\u039bN \u2217 = 0.9 GeV, \u039bN = 0.8 GeV, \u039b\u03c1 = 0.8 GeV, \u039b\u03c9 = 1.2 GeV,\nIII.\n\n(14)\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nIn this Section, we provide numerical results for total and differential cross sections and\nbeam asymmetries. First, we show those for the total cross sections as functions of the\nphoton energy in the laboratory frame in Fig. 2 for the proton target (first and second\nrows) and neutron target (third and fourth rows). The results are shown separately for each\n\u00b1\nP\n= 1/2\u00b1\nspin-parity combination and the sign of \u03bc\u03b3N N \u2217 (Jsign\n\u00b1 and 3/2\u00b1 ) . When we turn\noff the effects from the new resonance (\u03bc\u03b3pp\u2217 \u2248 0), the proton data are well reproduced.\nThis tendency is well compatible with estimations from the \u03c7QSM [10] and consistent with\nour previous results [15]. On the contrary, as for the neutron target, we have varieties\nin the shapes of the curves due to the interferences between the new resonance and other\ncontributions, depending on its spin, parity and sign(\u03bc\u03b3nn\u2217 ). We observe that there is\n+\n\u2212\nP\n= 1/2+\nconstructive interference for the cases of Jsign\n+ , 1/2\u2212 and 3/2+ , showing the peak\ndue to the new resonance N \u2217 (1675). Note that the interference is mainly due to the new\nresonance and the spin-5/2 resonances, F15 (1680) and D15 (1675). The absolute values of\nthe photon coupling are found to be |\u03bc\u03b3nn\u2217 | \u2265 0.1 for the spin-1/2 cases and |\u03bc\u03b3nn\u2217 | \u2265 0.01\nfor the spin-3/2 ones, respectively, to provide clear peaks, indicating the evidence for the\nnew resonance.\nIn Figs. 3 and 4, we draw the results for the differential cross sections as functions of cos \u03b8,\nin which \u03b8 stands for the angle between the incident photon and outgoing kaon in the center\nof mass (CM) frame, at a fixed photon energy E\u03b3 = 800 and 1145 MeV, where experimental\ndata are available. At E\u03b3 \u2248 800 MeV, which is almost the same with the threshold value,\nwe have rather flat curves dominated by s-wave contributions as shown in Fig. 3. Especially,\nwe can reproduce well the experimental data, taken from Refs. [34, 35], for the proton target\ncase. The neutron results are also dominated by the s-wave ones and do not depend much\non the spin and parity of the new resonance. As the photon energy increases, higher wave\ncontributions start to come into play as shown in Fig. 4 for E\u03b3 \u2248 1145 MeV. Again, the\nproton data are well reproduced. However, we have rather different shapes for the neutron\nshowing a bump structure in the backward scattering region \u22121 \u2264 cos \u03b8 \u2264 \u22120.5. We verified\n2\n\nWe note that there have been several methods to remedy this unitarity breaking problem including the\nBlatt-Weisskopf penetration factor and introducing phenomenological off-shell parameters [19, 30, 31, 32].\n\n7\n\n\fP\nthat these bumps are due to the F15 (1680) contribution. Note that the dependence on Jsign\nis not so obvious again for all the spin-parity cases.\nIn Figs. 5 and 6, We show the differential cross sections with respect to the center of\nmass (CM) energy at fixed angle \u03b8 = 140 and 65 degrees, respectively. The experimental\ndata for the neutron and proton targets are taken from Ref. [4]. Our results for the proton\ntarget slightly deviate from the data at \u03b8 \u2248 140\u25e6 as shown in Fig. 7, although the energy\ndependence beyond ECM \u2248 1750 MeC, as well as the total cross section at the entire energy\nregion are reproduced well. In contrast, the neutron data are well reproduced for the cases\nP\n\u2212\n+\nof Jsign\n= 1/2+\n+ , 1/2\u2212 and 3/2+ as in the cases for the total cross section results. It turns out\nthat |\u03bc\u03b3nn\u2217 | \u2248 0.1 \u223c 0.2 for the spin-1/2 cases and |\u03bc\u03b3nn\u2217 | \u2248 0.01 \u223c 0.02 for the spin-3/2\nones are appropriate to reproduce the observed peak. It is worth mentioning that, as for the\nJ P = 1/2+ case, the estimated value of |\u03bc\u03b3nn\u2217 | is consistent with the result of the \u03c7QSM [10].\nFocusing in the forward scattering region \u03b8 \u2248 65\u25e6 as shown in Fig. 6, our results for the\nproton target are overestimated in comparison to the experimental data. Interestingly, since\nthe effects of F15 (1680) and D15 (1675) become stronger for the neutron target at this angle,\nthe peak around ECM \u2248 1.7 MeV becomes as high as that of S11 (1535). Thus, it is not easy\nto find a clear evidence for the new resonance in the forward scattering region.\nFinally, we would like to discuss the beam asymmetry for the present reaction process,\nwhich is defined as follows:\n\n\"\n\n#\n\n\"\n\nd\u03c3\nd\u03c3\nd\u03c3\nd\u03c3\n\u03a3=\n\u2212\n\u00d7\n+\nd\u03a9 k d\u03a9 \u22a5\nd\u03a9 k d\u03a9 \u22a5\n\n#\u22121\n\n.\n\n(15)\n\nHere the subscript k denotes that the polarization vector of the incident photon is parallel\nto the reaction plane, and vice versa for \u22a5. From this definition, electric dominance of the\nphoton coupling (E) gives \u03a3 \u223c +1 whereas magnetic one (M ) does \u03a3 \u223c \u22121. We show our\nresults in Figs. 7 and 8 as functions of \u03b8 at a fixed photon energy E\u03b3 = 870 and 1051 MeV\nP\nfor the same Jsign\n. In the vicinity of the threshold (E\u03b3 \u2248 870 MeV), the proton data are well\nreproduced showing a positive bump at around \u03b8 = 90\u25e6 which indicates that the electric\nphoton coupling prevails. The bump structures are slightly shifted to the forward angle for\nthe neutron target case, because of the effects from the spin-5/2 resonance contributions.\nHowever, from the beam asymmetry results, we can not see clear evidence for the new\nresonance. As the energy grows (E\u03b3 \u2248 1051 MeV), the numerical results start to deviate\nfrom the experimental data for the proton as shown in Fig. 8; the theory is almost symmetric,\nwhile the experiment asymmetric and entitled to the forward scattering region. We consider\nthat this deviation may result from unknown resonances, which are not taken into account\nP\nhere. Interestingly, although the results for the neutron are all similar to each Jsign\ncase, the\nbeam asymmetry becomes negative, resulting from the strong interference between the new\nresonance and F15 (1680).\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\n\nWe have investigated the \u03b7-meson photoproduction in an effective Lagrangian approach\nwhere the scattering amplitude was computed in the Born approximation. Following our\nprevious work, we studied the role of the new nucleon resonance at round Ecm \u223c 1.675\nGeV testing its possible spin and parity theoretically, considering 1/2\u00b1 as well as 3/2\u00b1 .\nIn addition to this resonance, we considered six other nucleon resonances, i.e. (D13 (1520),\n8\n\n\fS11 (1535), S11 (1650), D15 (1675), P11 (1710), P13 (1720)), and nucleon-pole and vector-meson\nexchange contributions as backgrounds. All coupling strengths were determined by available\nexperimental data and those obtained in the Nijmegen potential. Gauge invariance was\nsatisfied explicitly via appropriate form factor schemes.\nTotal and differential cross sections were computed and compared with the experimental data. In generl, the data for the proton were well reproduced without the new reso+\n\u2212\n+\nnance contribution, while for the neutron data with that for Jsign\n= 1/2+\n+ , 1/2\u2212 and 3/2\u2212 .\nMoreover, it turned out that the interferences between the new resonance and the spin-5/2\nresonant contributions (F15 and D15 ) were crucial for the neutron target. We estimated\n|\u03bc\u03b3nn\u2217 | \u2248 0.1 \u223c 0.2 for the spin-1/2 cases and |\u03bc\u03b3nn\u2217 | \u2248 0.01 \u223c 0.02 for the spin-3/2 ones\nto reproduce the peak at ECM \u2248 1675 MeV. However, it was not easy to determine the spin\nand parity of the new resonance unambiguously within the present framework.\nFrom these observations, the new resonance can be considered as N \u2217 (1/2\u00b1 , 3/2+ ) along\nwith the estimated strengths of \u03bc\u03b3N N \u2217 at best in the present work. This is the same conclusion as in our previous work, in which the spin-3/2 cases were not taken into account. Among\nthree possibilities of the spin and parity of N \u2217 (1675), it is interesting to adopt J P = 1/2+ ,\nsince our reaction study implies a photon coupling which is consistent with the prediction\nof the chiral quark-soliton model. The photon coupling that vanishes for the proton resonance is a general consequence of SU(3) flavor symmetry when the resonance is identified\nas a member of the antidecuplet pentaquark baryons. Experimentally, we still need further\ninformation in order to establish that the peak structure in the deuteron target is the real\none from the new resonance. Once it will be done, we will be able to make another step\nforward to exotic hadron spectroscopy.\nAcknowledgement\n\nThe authors are grateful to fruitful comments from J. K. Ahn, Y. Azimov, J.
