The underlying principle of this system\nconsisted of supplying individuals with supplementary\ninformation about the position of the matching ankle relative to\nthe reference ankle position through a tongue-placed tactile\noutput device generating electrotactile stimulation on a 36point (6 \u00d7 6) matrix held against the surface of the tongue\ndorsum. Precisely, (1) no electrodes were activated when both\nankles were in a similar angular position within a\npredetermined \"angular dead zone\" (ADZ); (2) 12 electrodes (2\n\u00d7 6) of the anterior and posterior zones of the matrix were\nactivated (corresponding to the stimulation of the front and\nrear portion of the tongue) when the matching ankle was in a\ntoo plantarflexed and dorsiflexed position relative to the\nreference ankle, respectively. The effects of two ADZ values of\n0.5\u00b0 and 1.5\u00b0 were evaluated. Results showed (1) more accurate\nand more consistent matching performances with than without\nbiofeedback and (2) more accurate and more consistent ankle\njoint matching performances when using the biofeedback\ndevice with the smaller ADZ value. These findings suggest that\n(1) electrotactile stimulation of the tongue can be used to\nimprove ankle joint proprioception and (2) this improvement\ncan be increased through an appropriate specification of the\nADZ parameter provided by the biofeedback system. Further\ninvestigations are needed to strengthen the potential clinical\nvalue of this device.\nKeywords - Biofeedback; Tactile display; Tongue; Proprioception; Human.\n\nI\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nN the last decades, a growing number of tactile displays\nhave been developed for sensory substitution or\naugmentation systems (e.g., [1-4]). These devices are\ndesigned to evoke tactile sensation within the skin at the\nlocation of the tactile stimulator using either mechanical\n(\"vibrotactile display\") or electrical (\"electrotactile display\")\nstimulation. The skin being the interface between the tactile\nstimulator and the neural sensory system, the performance of\na tactile display largely depends on the neurophysiologic\ncharacteristics of the receptive body regions. Along these\nlines, the human tongue has recently been suggested to\n\nNicolas Vuillerme is with the TIMC-IMAG Laboratory, Equipe AFIRM,\nUMR CNRS 5525, Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine de Grenoble, B\u00e2timent Jean Roget,\nF38706 La Tronche C\u00e9dex; phone: +33 4 76 63 74 86; fax: +33 4 76 51 86\n67; mail: Nicolas.Vuillerme@imag.fr\nOlivier Chenu, Anthony Fleury, Jacques Demongeot and Yohan Payan\nare also with the TIMC-IMAG Laboratory, UMR CNRS 5525, La Tronche,\nFrance. Mail: firstname.lastname@imag.fr\n\nprovide a promising electrotactile stimulation site [5].\nBecause of its dense mechanoreceptive innervations [6] and\nlarge somatosensory cortical representation [7], the tongue is\nindeed a very sensitive organ which can convey higherresolution information than the skin can [8-9]. In addition,\ndue to the excellent conductivity offered by the saliva,\nelectrotactile stimulation of the tongue requires only 3% of\nthe voltage (5 - 15 V) and much less current (0.4 - 2.0 mA)\nthan those required for the fingertip [5]. The Tongue Display\nUnit (TDU) has recently been developed to take advantage\nof these characteristics [5]. Initially used as a tactile-vision\nsensory substitution system to provide distal spatial\ninformation to blind people (e.g., [1,8,10,11]), the TDU also\nhas proven its efficiency as a tactile-proprioception sensory\naugmentation system [12]. The performance of this system\n(\"TDU-biofeedback system\") in improving proprioceptive\nacuity at the ankle joint recently has been evaluated on\nyoung healthy adults using an active matching task.\n\nFig. 1. Photograph of the Tongue Display Unit used in the present\nexperiment. It comprises a 2D electrode array (1.5 \u00d7 1.5 cm) consisting of\n36 gold-plated contacts each with a 1.4 mm diameter, arranged in a 6 \u00d7 6\nmatrix.\n\nPosition of the matching ankle relative to the reference\nankle was fed back to a tongue-placed tactile output device\ngenerating electrotactile stimulation on a 36-point (6 \u00d7 6)\nmatrix held against the surface of the tongue dorsum (Fig. 1)\nas follows: (1) no electrodes were activated when both\nankles were in a similar angular position within a\npredetermined \"angular dead zone\" (ADZ); and (2) 12\nelectrodes (2 \u00d7 6) of the anterior or posterior zones of the\nmatrix were activated (corresponding to the stimulation of\nthe front and rear portion of the tongue) when the matching\nankle was in a too plantarflexed and dorsiflexed position\nrelative to the reference ankle, respectively. Results of this\nexperiment showed more accurate and more consistent\nmatching performances when using the TDU-biofeedback\nsystem with an ADZ equal to 1,5\u00b0. At this point, it is\n\n\fpossible that the observed effects markedly depend on the\nspecification of the ADZ value. The purpose of the present\nstudy was thus designed to assess this possibility, by\ncomparing the effects of providing two different ADZ values\n(0.5\u00b0 and 1.5\u00b0) on the performance of the TDU-biofeedback\nsystem. It was hypothesized that (1) biofeedback delivered\nthrough the TDU would improve position sense at the ankle\njoint and (2) that this improvement would be larger with\nsmaller ADZ value (0.5\u00b0). Note that such a result could\nprovide further insight into the conception and optimization\nof rehabilitative programs or ergonomical assistive tools.\nII. METHODS\nA. Participants\nTwelve young healthy males adults (age = 27.7 \u00b1 5.4\nyears; body weight = 68.9 \u00b1 6.9 kg; height = 177.7 \u00b1 6.5 cm)\nvolunteered for this study and gave their informed consent to\nthe experimental procedure as required by the Helsinki\ndeclaration (1964) and the local Ethics Committee. None of\nthe participants presented any history of injury, surgery or\npathology to either lower extremity that could affect their\nability to perform the experiment.\n\nFig. 2. Illustration of the experimental setup used for measuring ankle joint\nposition sense.\n\nB. Apparatus for measuring ankle joint position sense\nParticipants were seated barefoot in a chair with their right\nand left foot secured to two rotating footplates. The knee\njoints were flexed at about 110\u00b0. Movement was restricted to\nthe ankle in the sagittal plane, with no movement occurring\nat the hip or knee. The axes of rotation of the footplates were\naligned with the axes of rotation of the ankles. Precision\nlinear potentiometers attached on both footplates provided\nanalog voltage signals proportional to the ankles' angles. A\nhandheld press-button allowed recording the matching.\nSignals from the potentiometers and the press-button were\nsampled at 100 Hz (12 bit A/D conversion), then processed\nand stored within the Labview 5.1 data acquisition system.\nIn addition, a panel was placed above the subject's legs to\neliminate visual feedback about both ankles position (Fig.\n2).\n\nFig. 3. Sensory coding schemes for the TDU (lower panels) as a function of\nthe position of the matching right ankle relative to the reference left ankle\n(upper panels). Black dots represent activated electrodes. A: no electrodes\nare activated when both ankles are in a similar angular position within a\nrange of 0.5\u00b0 and 1.5\u00b0, for the TDU0.5\u00b0 and TDU1.5\u00b0 conditions, respectively.\nB: 12 electrodes (2 \u00d7 6) of the anterior zone of the matrix are activated\n(corresponding to the stimulation of the front portion of the tongue dorsum)\nwhen the matching right ankle was in a too plantarflexed position relative to\nthe reference left ankle. C: 12 electrodes (2 \u00d7 6) of the posterior zone of the\nmatrix are activated (corresponding to the stimulation of the rear portion of\nthe tongue dorsum) when the matching right ankle was in a too dorsiflexed\nposition relative to the reference left ankle.\n\nC. Apparatus for providing biofeedback: the TDU system\nThe underlying principle of the biofeedback device used\nin the present experiment consisted of supplying participants\nwith supplementary information about the position of the\nmatching right ankle relative to the reference left ankle\nposition through a tongue-placed tactile output device [12].\nElectrotactile stimuli were delivered to the front part of the\ntongue dorsum via flexible electrode arrays placed in the\nmouth, with connection to the stimulator apparatus via a flat\ncable passing out of the mouth. The system comprises a 2D\nelectrode array (1.5 \u00d7 1.5 cm) consisting of 36 gold-plated\ncontacts each with a 1.4 mm diameter, arranged in a 6 \u00d7 6\nmatrix [12] (Fig. 1).\nThe following coding scheme for the TDU was used: (1)\nno electrical stimulation when both ankles were in a similar\nangular position within ADZs of 0.5\u00b0 and 1.5\u00b0, for the\nTDU0.5\u00b0 and TDU1.5\u00b0 conditions, respectively (Fig. 3A); (2)\nstimulation of either the anterior or posterior zone of the\nmatrix (2 \u00d7 6 matrix) (i.e. stimulation of front or rear\nportions of the tongue) depending on whether the matching\nright ankle was in a too plantarflexed or dorsiflexed position\nrelative to the reference left ankle, respectively (Fig. 3B and\n3C, respectively). The frequency of the stimulation was\nmaintained constant at 50 Hz across participants, ensuring a\nsensation of the continuous stimulation over the tongue\nsurface. Conversely, the sensitivity to the electrotactile\nstimulation varying not only between individuals but also as\na function of location on the tongue, as reported in a\npreliminary experiment [12], the intensity of the electrical\nstimulating current was adjusted for each subject, and for\neach of the front and rear portions of the tongue\n\n\fD. Task and procedure\nThe experimenter first placed the left reference ankle at a\npredetermined angle where the position of the foot was\nmaintained by means of a support [13]. By doing so,\nparticipants did not exert any effort to maintain the position\nof the left reference ankle, preventing the contribution of\neffort cues coming from the reference ankle to the sense of\nposition during the test [13]. Two matching angular target\npositions were presented: (1) 10\u00b0 of plantarflexion (P10\u00b0) and\n(2) 10\u00b0 of dorsiflexion (D10\u00b0). These positions were selected\nto avoid the extremes of the ankle range of motion to\nminimize additional sensory input from joint and cutaneous\nreceptors (e.g., [14]).\nOnce the left foot had been positioned at the test angle\n(P10\u00b0 vs. D10\u00b0), subject's task was to match its position by\nvoluntary placement of their right ankle. When they felt that\nthey had reached the target angular position (i.e., when the\nright foot was presumably aligned with the left foot), they\nwere asked to press the button held in their right hand,\nthereby registering the matched position.\nThree experimental conditions were presented: (1) the NoTDU condition serving as a control condition, the (2)\nTDU0.5\u00b0 and (3) TDU1.5\u00b0 conditions in which participants\nperformed the task using a TDU-biofeedback system, as\ndescribed above (section IIC).\nFive trials for each target angular position and each\nexperimental condition were performed. The order of\npresentation of the two targets angular positions (P10\u00b0 vs.\nD10\u00b0) and the three experimental conditions (No-TDU vs.\nTDU0.5\u00b0 vs. TDU1.5\u00b0) was randomized. Participants were not\ngiven feedback about their performance and errors in the\nposition of the right ankle were not corrected.\nE. Data analysis\nTwo dependent variables were used to assess matching\nperformances [15]. (1) The absolute error (AE), the absolute\nvalue of the difference between the position of the right\nmatching ankle and the position of the left reference ankle, is\na measure of the overall accuracy of positioning. (2) The\nvariable error (VE), the variance around the mean constant\nerror score, is a measure of the variability of the positioning.\nDecreased AE and VE scores indicate increased accuracy\nand consistency of the positioning, respectively [15].\nF. Statistical analysis\nData obtained for AE and VE were submitted to separate\n2 Targets angular positions (P10\u00b0 vs. D10\u00b0) \u00d7 3 Conditions\n(No-TDU vs. TDU0.5\u00b0 vs. TDU1.5\u00b0) analyses of variances\n(ANOVAs) with repeated measures of both factors. Post-hoc\nanalyses (orthogonal planned comparisons) were performed\nwhenever necessary. Level of significance was set at 0.05.\n\nFig. 4. Mean and standard deviation for the absolute error (A) and the\nvariable error (B) for the three No-TDU, TDU0.5\u00b0 and TDU1.5\u00b0 conditions.\nThese three experimental conditions are presented with different symbols:\nNo-TDU (white bars), TDU1.5\u00b0 (black bars) and TDU0.5\u00b0 (grey bars). (*: P <\n0.05, **: P < 0.01, ***: P < 0.001).\n\nIII. RESULTS\nA. Positioning accuracy\nAnalysis of the AE showed a main effect of Condition\n(F(2,22) = 39.76, P < 0.001, Fig. 4A), yielding smaller\nvalues in the TDU0.5\u00b0 and TDU1.5\u00b0 conditions than No-TDU\ncondition (Ps < 0.001) and smaller values in the TDU0.5\u00b0\nthan TDU1.5\u00b0 condition (P < 0.05). The ANOVAs showed no\nmain effect of Target angular position (P > 0.05), nor any\ninteraction of Target angular position \u00d7 Condition (P >\n0.05).\nB. Positioning variability\nAnalysis of the VE showed a main effect of Condition\n(F(2,22) = 16.67, P < 0.001, Fig. 4B), yielding smaller\nvalues in the TDU0.5\u00b0 and TDU1.5\u00b0 conditions than No-TDU\ncondition (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively) and smaller\nvalues in the TDU0.5\u00b0 than TDU1.5\u00b0 condition (P < 0.05). The\nANOVAs showed no main effect of Target angular position\n(P > 0.05), nor any interaction of Target angular position \u00d7\nCondition (P > 0.05).\nIV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\nOn the whole, more accurate and more consistent ankle\njoint matching performances were observed when the TDU\nbiofeedback system was in use than when it was not. These\nresults confirm our first hypothesis [12] and provide\nadditional evidence that electrotactile stimulation of the\ntongue can be used to improve ankle joint proprioception.\nInterestingly, the performance of the TDU biofeedback\nsystem further was shown to depend on the specification of\nthe ADZ parameter. Indeed, in accordance with our second\nhypothesis, more accurate and more consistent ankle joint\nmatching performances were observed when using the TDU\nbiofeedback system with the smaller ADZ value. An\nappropriate specification of this parameter could thus\n\n\fconstitute a relevant means to increase the performance of\nthe TDU biofeedback system. For instance, such a\nspecification could allow optimizing the use of the tongueplaced tactile biofeedback device as a rehabilitation protocol\nor assistance based tools, by taking the patient's\nproprioceptive capabilities or the ongoing task's accuracy\nrequirement into account. Note that optimizing the TDU\nbiofeedback system is all the more relevant since accurate\nproprioception at the ankle joint is critical for body\norientation and balance control and represents a prerequisite\nfor different functional activities such as walking, running or\ndriving. At this point, further investigations involving\nindividuals with proprioceptive deficits (e.g., elderly\npersons, patients with diabetic neuropathy) are needed to\nstrengthen the potential clinical value of this technique.\nHowever, these encouraging results already have led us to\nimprove the current TDU biofeedback system by making it\nwireless to increase its portability to permit its use over\nlong-time period in real-life environment. Indeed, to be\nacceptable as part of a viable system, this device had to be\nlightweight, portable, and capable of several hours of\ncontinuous operations. The current ribbon TDU system does\nnot meet these requirements yet. Within this context, we\nhave developed a wireless radio-controlled version of the 6 \u00d7\n6 TDU matrix. This consists in a matrix glued onto the\ninferior part of the orthodontic retainer including\nmicroelectronics, antenna and battery, which can be worn\ninside the mouth like a dental retainer. This wearable device\nis currently tested by our industrial partner (Coronis-Systems\nwww.coronis-systems.com) that will provide Wavenis, its\nwireless Ultra Lower Power technology which has been\npreferred to current radio frequency (RF) standards that have\nshortcomings when considering Ultra Low Power\nchallenges.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nWe are indebted to Professor Paul Bach-y-Rita for\nintroducing us to the TDU and for discussions about sensory\nsubstitution.
