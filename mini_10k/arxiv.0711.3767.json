These two properties taken together indicate that the projected BCS Hamiltonian\ncaptures the essential low-energy physics of the t-J model in the whole underdoped region.\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe investigation of strongly correlated electron systems has been a central issue in solid state physics\nfor more than four decades. The discovery of highTc superconductivity in copper-oxide based compounds\n(cuprates) revived the interest in simple models displaying such strong correlations. Two much investigated\nmodels are the Hubbard model and its \"descendant\",\nthe t-J model1,2 . One of the main theoretical questions\nin that field is whether or not there is a superconducting phase in the t-J model1 . Besides, the interplay between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in the\ncuprates as well as their sensitivity to doping is still not\nvery well understood.\nIt is clear that in superconducting state induced by\nelectron-electron interaction the formation of Cooper\npairs must also reflect strong electron correlations. As\na result the BCS effective Hamiltonian should be directly modified by the inclusion of a non-double occupancy (NDO) constraint to account for such an effect.\nIn a recent paper, Park discussed a close connection between the t-J model and the Gutzwiller-projected BCS\nHamiltonian4 . It was shown both numerically and analytically that the ground states of the t-J model at\nhalf filling (i.e. of the 2D aniferromagnetic Heisenberg\nmodel) and of the strongly correlated BCS hamiltonian\nare equivalent to each other. Moreover, at sufficiently\nsmall doping, there is numerical evidence of a strong overlap between those two ground state wavefunctions, which\nprovides further support for the existence of superconductivity in the t-J model. Clearly it would be interesting to establish by analytical means such an equivalence\nat non-zero hole concentration. As is known, slightly\n\naway from half filling the long-range AF order is still observed in the cuprate superconductors. If the projected\nBCS Hamiltonian is indeed believed to contain close to\nhalf filling the low-energy physics of the t-J Hamiltonian, its ground state must also exhibit the AF order\nin the immediate vicinity of half filling. This manifests\nitself as a quite nontrivial necessary condition for the\nlow-energy physics described by the Gutzwiller-projected\nBCS Hamiltonian to be considered identical to that of the\nt-J Hamiltonian at sufficiently low doping.\nThe purpose of the present report is to investigate the\nGutzwiller-projected BCS Hamiltonian, close to half filling, analytically. We do not address here the issue of\nthe properties of the t-J model at moderate doping, concentrating our full attention instead to the region of the\nphase diagram very close to half filling. We derive the\nlow-energy long-wavelength effective action for the lightly\ndoped 2D projected BCS Hamiltonian on a bipartite lattice. The action obtained is shown to be identical to that\nof the 2D quantum antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model\nexplicitly represented by the 3D nonlinear \u03c3-model. In\nother words, close to half filling the ground state of\nthe Gutzwiller-projected BCS Hamiltonian is antiferromagnetically ordered and non-superconducting. Since\nthe conventional BCS Hamiltonian does not exhibit any\nmagnetic ordering and always displays superconductivity,\nthose results explicitly demonstrate that antiferromagnetism appears as a natural consequence of the strong\nCoulomb repulsion at low doped regimes.\nFormally, the Gutzwiller projection takes care of the\nstrong electron correlation due to the large on-site\nCoulomb repulsion. Close to half filling, the infinitely\nstrong short-range Coulomb repulsion between lattice\nelectrons brings about the superexchange of the emer-\n\n\f2\ngent local spin moments by means of the virtual exchange\nprocesses which involve virtual creation of the electron\nspin singlets on the nearest-neighbor (nn) empty sites.\nAs a result the Gutzwiller-projected strong-pairing BCS\nHamiltonian can be described in terms of the emergent\nspin-spin exchange interaction and the AF ordering continues from half filling up to a small doping. In other\nwords the projected BCS Hamiltonian can describe both\nthe superconducting state at moderate doping and, in\ncontrast with the conventional BCS Hamiltonian, the ordered magnetic phase for sufficiently low doping.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec.II we set up\nthe necessary notation and emphasize the importance of\nthe Gutzwiller projection close to half filling. In Sec.III\nthe low-energy action for the Gutzwiller-projected BCS\nHamiltonian is derived within the coherent-state pathintegral approach. We provide an independent operator\nderivation in Sec.IV. We conclude in Sec.V by discussing\nsome physical implications of the obtained low-energy\nrepresentation of the projected BCS Hamiltonian. Necessary technical details are discussed in Appendices.\nII.\n\nGUTZWILLER-PROJECTED BCS\nHAMILTONIAN\n\nij\u03c3\n\nc\u2020i\u03c3 cj\u03c3 + H.c.\n\nwhere X \u2191\u2191 + X \u2193\u2193 + X 00 = |0ih0| + | \u2191ih\u2191 | + | \u2193ih\u2193 | = I\u02c6 is\nthe identity operator in the on-site Gutzwiller-projected\nHilbert space.

Since\n\n\f6\na general case of large but finite values of the parameters\nU and \u03bc is technically involved, we consider two limiting\ncases, namely, that of U = \u221e, and \u03bc is large but finite\nand that of \u03bc = \u221e, and U is large but finite.\nPhysically, for the fully Gutzwiller-projected (U = \u221e)\nBCS Hamiltonian the AF order sets in at low doping due\nto the superexchange that involves empty states. In the\nsecond case when \u03bc tends to \u221e and the repulsion parameter U is large but finite, there is a small probability for\nthe doubly occupied electron states to exist, which results in the emergence of the long-range magnetic order\nthrough the virtual superexchange process that involves\nthe doubly occupied states.

This ensures that any\nstate with a finite number of holes is projected out from\nthe theory. Close to half-filling, \u03bc is large and therefore\nwe can treat V as a perturbation to H0 . The ground\nstate of H0 contains no holes and is highly degenerate,\ncorresponding to all possible spin orientations in the halffilled limit. We denote this manifold by |0g i.\nLet us now define the operator P0 that projects into\nthe subspace with no holes, that is, it projects into the\nground state of H0 .

In\nthe next order, we have to calculate matrix elements like\n\nWe conclude by discussing the physical implications\nof the close connection between the Gutzwiller-projected\nBCS Hamiltonian and the t-J model of the high-Tc superconductors. Our result shows that the ground state of\nthe Gutzwiller-projected BCS Hamiltonian can in principle be considered a reference state of a lightly doped\nMott insulator. Since the Gutzwiller projection does not\ncommute with the BCS Hamiltonian4 , this state does\nnot coincide with the Gutzwiller-projected BCS ground\nstate which is just the short-range RVB state proposed\nby Anderson12 .\nThe RVB state is known to show no long-range order even at half filling. In contrast, right at half filling as\nwell as in the immediate vicinity of half filling the ground\nstate of the strongly correlated BCS Hamiltonian exhibits\nlong-ranged AF order as is observed in the cuprate superconductors. Note also that the low-energy action that\ncorresponds to the strong-pairing projected BCS Hamiltonian cannot in itself account for the weakening as well\nas the eventual disappearance of the magnetic ordering as\nthe hole concentration increases. This effect is produced\nby the growing influence of the kinetic t-term that gradually destroys the long-range ordered state. Therefore,\none needs to include the kinetic t-term into consideration\nto regain the full Gutzwiller-projected BCS Hamiltonian,\n\n\f7\nG\nHBCS\ngiven in Eq. (1), in order to be able to describe\nthe actual behavior of the high-Tc phase diagram away\nfrom half filling.\nAt a moderate, non-zero doping the RVB wavefunction and its improvements13 yield good agreement with\nexperiments9 as well as with numerical studies3 and are\nconjectured to be a good ansatz wavefunctions for the\nt-J model in this region10 . In doped regimes sufficiently\naway from half filling, the RVB state turns out to be inG\n4\ndeed qualitatively similar to the ground state of HBCS\n.\nOne can therefore conclude that the ground-state waveG\nfunction of the HBCS\nHamiltonian appears as a natural\ngeneralization of Anderson's RVB state for low doping.\n\nAPPENDIX A: SU(2) ALGEBRA AND\nCOHERENT STATES\n\n[S+ , S\u2212 ] = 2Sz ,\n\n~ 2 = 3/4.\nS\n\n(A1)\n\nActing with the \"lowering\" spin operator S \u2212 on the\n\"highest weight\" state | \u2191i we get the normalized su(2)\nCS parametrized by a complex number z\n1\n1\n|zi = p\nexp(zS \u2212 )| \u2191i = p\n(| \u2191i + z| \u2193i).\n2\n1 + |z|\n1 + |z|2\n(A2)\nIn the basis spanned by the vectors | \u2191i, | \u2193i we have\nS+ = | \u2191i|h\u2193 |, S\u2212 = | \u2193i|h\u2191 |, Sz = 12 (| \u2191i|h\u2191 | \u2212 | \u2193i|h\u2193 |).\nThe CS symbols of the su(2) generators are then easily\nevaluated to be (S cl := hz|S|zi):\nz\nz\u0304\ncl\n, S\u2212\n=\n,\n1 + |z|2\n1 + |z|2\n1 1 \u2212 |z|2\n2\n~cl\n~ 2 )cl = 3/4.

Base space of that bundle, two-sphere S 2 , appears\nas a classical phase-space of spin, whereas its covariantly\nconstant sections, |zi : (\u2202t + ia)|zi = 0, form a Hilbert\nspace of a quantum spin.\n\nActing with the \"lowering\" superspin operators X \u2193\u2191\nand X \u21930 on the \"highest weight\" state | \u2191i we get the\nnormalized su(2|1) coherent state in the 3D fundamental\nrepresentation,\n\u0001\n \u0304 \u22121/2 exp zX \u2193\u2191 + \u03beX 0\u2191 | \u2191i\n|z, \u03bei = (1 + z\u0304z + \u03be\u03be)\n \u0304 \u22121/2 (| \u2191i + z| \u2193i + \u03be|0i), (B1)\n= (1 + z\u0304z + \u03be\u03be)\nwhere z is a complex number, and \u03be is a complex Grassmann parameter. The Grassmann parameter appears\nhere due to the fact that X \u21930 is a fermionic operator\nin contrast with the operator X \u2193\u2191 . The product \u03beX 0\u2191\nrepresents therefore a bosonic quantity as required.\nAt \u03be = 0, the su(2|1) CS reduces to the ordinary su(2)\nCS, |z, \u03be = 0i \u2261 |zi (A2), parametrized by a complex\ncoordinate z \u2208 CP1 \u2243 S 2 .
