INTRODUCTION\n\n2\n\nExperiments designed to study rare events such as the interactions of solar neutrinos [1],\n\n3\n\ndark matter particles [2] or rare processes like double beta decay (DBD) [3] are carried out in\n\n4\n\nunderground laboratories. One of the main problems in such searches is the presence in\n\n5\n\nvarious energy regions of background due to environmental radiation. The contribution due\n\n6\n\nto cosmic rays [4] is strongly reduced by installing the experiment underground [5],\n\n7\n\nsometimes with a further reduction by means of veto counters. While the local environmental\n\n8\n\nradiation, mainly J\u0010rays or neutrons, can be suitably shielded with inert materials , special\n\n9\n\ncare should be devoted to reduce the intrinsic radioactivity of the detector itself or of the\n\n10\n\nmaterial immediately surrounding it [6]. In addition to the natural primordial radioactive\n\n11\n\ncontamination of detector material, one has to reduce the presence of radioactive nuclei\n\n12\n\nproduced by cosmic rays before the installation underground [7]. Shipping materials by\n\n13\n\nairplane may be an issue due to the much higher cosmic ray flux at high altitude which could\n\n14\n\nbe two orders of magnitude higher.\n\n15\n\nThe cosmic-ray contribution to the intrinsic radioactivity of detectors has been predicted\n\n16\n\nby various authors using specific codes like COSMO [8] or general purpose codes like\n\n17\n\nGEANT4 [9] .To evaluate the activation cross sections for particles at cosmic ray energies, a\n\n18\n\nset of semi-empirical\n\n19\n\nSilberberg and Tsao [10,11], and are used by codes like the mentioned COSMO and the\n\n20\n\nrecently introduced\n\n21\n\nmeasurements of activation cross sections carried out with protons at various accelerators and\n\n22\n\ncan be applied to evaluate the effect of cosmic rays, because the fluxes [4] and cross-sections\n\n23\n\n[12] of cosmic-ray neutrons in altitude can be assumed to be similar to those for protons [13,\n\n24\n\n14]. Many of these cross-section evaluations and measurements have been carried out for\n\n25\n\ngermanium [15-25] because of experiments with Ge diodes; others refer to different targets\n\ncross section formulas for proton-nucleus reactions developed by\n\nACTIVIA [12]. To improve its reliability, the latter has been tuned to\n\n1\n\n\f1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n\n26\n\n[26-34]. In this paper, we report extensive measurements of proton-induced radionuclide\n\n27\n\nproduction cross sections on tellurium, for which limited data exist [12,35,36]. The main goal\n\n28\n\nof this study is the identification of the radioactive isotopes that can be produced by cosmic\n\n29\n\nray exposure of TeO2 cryogenic detectors (or bolometers) [37].\n\n30\n\nTeO2 bolometers are used to search for neutrinoless DBD of\n\n31\n\nabundance of 33.8 % and a transition energy (QEE \u0003of\n\n32\n\nsensitivity on the absolute neutrino mass, comparable to the one of\n\n33\n\nexperiments, has been reached with the CUORICINO experiment [40,41] based on an array\n\n34\n\nof 62 crystals of TeO2 with a total mass of about 40.7 kg. To improve this result a larger scale\n\n35\n\nexperiment is presently under construction : The Cryogenic Underground Observatory for\n\n36\n\nRare Events (CUORE) [42,43] will employ approximately 750 kg of TeO 2 bolometers in a\n\n37\n\nsearch for the neutrinoless DBD of\n\n38\n\nneutrino mass as indicated by the results of neutrino oscillations in the inverse hierarchy\n\n39\n\nhypothesis. Minimizing the background in the vicinity of the QEE value is crucial for the\n\n40\n\nsuccess of this experiment. Thanks to the deep underground location of the apparatus (that is\n\n41\n\nbeing assembled in the underground Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Italy) and to a\n\n42\n\ncareful design of the gamma-ray and neutron shields [44,45], the main background sources in\n\n43\n\nCUORE will come from the radioactivity of the detector constructing materials [42,43,46,47].\n\n44\n\nAmong these sources, cosmogenic activated isotopes may play a relevant role. For this reason\n\n45\n\na special protocol for the crystal procurement have been studied [46,47] in order to minimize\n\n46\n\nthe exposure of TeO2 crystals to cosmic rays during growth and transportation: crystals are\n\n47\n\ndelivered from China (where they are grown) to Italy by ship in order to avoid the larger\n\n48\n\nactivation due by air transportation, then are immediately stored underground. The total\n\n49\n\nexposure to sea-level cosmic rays does not exceed 45 days (starting from growth) while the\n\n50\n\nstorage underground is between 4 and 1 years long, depending on the production batch.\n\n130\n\n130\n\nTe which has a natural\n\n2527.0 keV [38,39]. The best\n76\n\nGe and\n\n100\n\nMo\n\nTe. Its aim is to reach a sensitivity on the absolute\n\n2\n\n\f1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n\n51\n\nTo demonstrate that this procurement protocol is able to ensure acceptable low levels of\n\n52\n\ncosmogenic activation is not straightforward. Indeed, a direct evaluation of the activity of the\n\n53\n\npotentially dangerous isotopes is often impossible: whatever the technique used the sensitivity\n\n54\n\nis too low (as an example CUORE requirements for the TeO2 crystal contamination in 60Co\n\n55\n\nare below one PBq/kg [42]).\n\n56\n\nFor this reason the only solution is to rely on the computation of the expected activity on the\n\n57\n\nbasis of crystal exposure time, cosmic ray fluxes and activation cross sections.\n\n58\n\n2. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\n\n59\n\nExposures to the proton beams of TeO2 samples have been performed in USA at the Los\n\n60\n\nAlamos National Laboratory's Neutron Science Center at 0.8 GeV and in Europe at CERN at\n\n61\n\n1.4 and 23 GeV. The content of other elements in our samples was always less that a Pg/g.\n\n62\n\nBefore exposure, each sample was tested for the presence of relevant activities produced by\n\n63\n\ncosmic rays which were found to be negligible. All accelerator activation has been followed\n\n64\n\nby J-ray spectroscopic analysis of the irradiated samples at different times after irradiation.\n\n65\n\n2. 1 MEASUREMENTS CARRIED OUT IN USA\n\n66\n\nThe 0.80-GeV irradiation was conducted in the \"Blue Room\" at the Los Alamos National\n\n67\n\nLaboratory's Neutron Science Center (LANSCE).\n\nThe Te target was fabricated from\n\n68\n\n99.9999% pure Te Alpha Aesar metallic powder that was pressed into a 6.9-mm thick disk\n\n69\n\nthat had 93.4% of normal Te metal density. To confirm that the proton beam was impinging\n\n70\n\nentirely upon the target, a phosphor was placed in the target position before irradiation. A\n\n71\n\nstack of targets was placed in air and irradiated with 800 r 5 MeV protons for approximately\n\n72\n\n5 minutes. The total beam fluence was monitored by a beam current integrator in order to\n\n73\n\nhave approximately 1013 protons incident upon the target stack. The stack was made up of\n\n74\n\n6.4 mm thick polyethylene in front of the Te target and then an aluminium backing of 2 mm\n\n75\n\nthickness. More precise proton fluence numbers were extracted from the production of\n\n22\n\nNa\n3\n\n\f76\n1\n2 77\n3\n4\n5 78\n6\n7 79\n8\n9\n10 80\n11\n12 81\n13\n14\n15 82\n16\n17 83\n18\n19\n84\n20\n21\n22 85\n23\n24 86\n25\n26\n27 87\n28\n29 88\n30\n31\n32 89\n33\n34 90\n35\n36\n37 91\n38\n39 92\n40\n41\n93\n42\n43\n44 94\n45\n46 95\n47\n48\n49 96\n50\n51 97\n52\n53\n54 98\n55\n56 99\n57\n58\n100\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n\nand 7Be in the monitor materials. The proton fluence deduced from the monitor foils was\ndetermined to be (1.2 r 0.1) x 1013 p\u0098cm -2. The cross sections for production of these isotopes\nfrom 27Al have been previously determined using a very similar experimental setup at LANL\n[49], so these cross sections were used instead of evaluated data. The polyethylene monitor\nwas analyzed using evaluated data for the C(p, x)7Be cross section [50]. It should be noted\nthat the energy lost by protons while traversing the target stack was significantly less than the\noverall uncertainty in the beam energy and therefore the proton energies are assumed to\nremain constant throughout the stack.\nAfter the bombardment at 0.8 GeV at LANSCE, the samples were transported from Los\nAlamos back to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) where counting began\napproximately 15 days after irradiation. The samples were initially assayed with a 25%\nrelative efficiency (with respect to that of a 7.62 x 7.62 cm NaI detector) n-type coaxial highpurity germanium detector. The samples were counted multiple times over the course of a\nweek in order to extract half-life information from lines that could not be readily identified.\nThese counting runs occurred at both 7.6 cm from the detector's end cap and with the sample\nagainst the end cap. Later, the targets were counted for longer periods with an 80% relative\nefficiency high purity germanium detector at LBNL's Low Background Facility (LBF). They\nwere counted there intermittently for approximately one year to allow weaker long-lived lines\nto appear out of the Compton continuum. These counting runs occurred with samples either\nat 12 cm from the end cap or touching the end cap. All of the measurements of the targets\nirradiated at LANSCE were performed using ORTEC PC-based data acquisition systems.\nFigure 1 illustrates an energy spectrum of the Te target taken approximately 16 days after the\nLANSCE irradiation.\nTo determine the detection efficiencies for the four counting arrangements described\nabove, calibrated point sources of\n\n22\n\nNa, 54Mn, 57Co, 60Co,\n\n109\n\nCd,\n\n137\n\nCs,\n\n152\n\nEu and\n\n228\n\nTh were\n\n4\n\n\f1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n\n101\n\nused to establish a full-energy efficiency calibration curve of the detectors for point sources.\n\n102\n\nThe thick targets that were being counted, however, were sufficiently different from point\n\n103\n\nsources to warrant further effort. In order to establish first-order corrections for both the\n\n104\n\ngeometric and self-attenuating effects of the thick targets, an identical un-irradiated Te target\n\n105\n\n(henceforth referred to as \"blank\") was placed at the described distance and the point source\n\n106\n\nwas placed behind the blank. The efficiency curves resulting from these two geometries were\n\n107\n\nthen averaged to produce the effective efficiency curve for a given target being counted by a\n\n108\n\ngiven detector. While this method proved effective for the calibration of counting geometries\n\n109\n\nwhere the targets were further from the detector, coincident summing of lines prevented it\n\n110\n\nfrom being practical when the targets were placed directly against the end caps of the\n\n111\n\ndetectors. In this case we employed a method similar to that described by Gmuca and\n\n112\n\nRibansky [51]. An efficiency curve for a geometry with the source further from the detector\n\n113\n\nis determined as above, then using only the sources with non-coincident lines,\n\n114\n\n137\n\n115\n\nto that ratio. Then the longer-distance efficiency curve is multiplied by the aforementioned\n\n116\n\ncurve resulting in the final efficiency curve for these close geometries.\n\n57\n\nCo,\n\n109\n\nCd,\n\nCs, and 54Mn, the ratio of efficiencies at the two geometries is determined and a curve is fit\n\n117\n\nA brief inspection of the spectra shown in Fig. 1 allows one to gain an idea as to how many\n\n118\n\nlines were present in the spectra. Each line was identified by energy and half-life. Where\n\n119\n\nlines could be attributed to multiple isotopes, other lines were searched for to determine if one\n\n120\n\ncould positively identify which isotope was producing the line. If there was no way to\n\n121\n\nconfirm the presence of an isotope because it only had a single line or its other lines were also\n\n122\n\nirresolvable, information from the half-life was employed. Cross sections were determined\n\n123\n\nusing the extracted J-ray peak areas, measured J-ray detector efficiencies, tabulated J-ray\n\n124\n\nintensities [51], measured target thickness, measured proton fluence and the start and stop\n\n125\n\ntimes of the J-ray counting.\n\n5\n\n\f126\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n\n2. 2 MEASUREMENTS CARRIED OUT IN EUROPE\n\n127\n\nCrystals of TeO2 with natural isotopic composition of tellurium [48] were exposed in air to\n\n128\n\ntwo proton beams of different energies at CERN. Details on the samples and on the exposures\n\n129\n\nare reported in Table I. A single exposure of a telluride crystal of 0.457 g mass and irregular\n\n130\n\nshape was performed at the 1.4 GeV beam of ISOLDE using the RABBIT system [52]. The\n\n131\n\ncross section of the beam was approximately circular with a radius at half maximum of ~2\n\n132\n\ncm, thus totally covering the sample. The geometrical beam profile was taken into account to\n\n133\n\nevaluate the effective proton fluence on the target. Due to the small thickness of the target,\n\n134\n\nenergy loss in it was negligible. The total beam fluence was monitored by a beam current\n\n135\n\nintegrator and known to within 10%.\n\n136\n\nTwo exposures were also carried out in air with the 23 GeV beam at the IRRADIATION 1\n\n137\n\nFacility at the CERN PS East Hall [53,54]. The beam fluence was monitored with a current\n\n138\n\nintegrator and tested by activation of a 100 Pm thick Al foil. The overall uncertainty on the\n\n139\n\nfluence was 10%. The first exposure was carried out with a crystal of TeO2 of irregular shape\n\n140\n\nwith a mass of 0.428 g and a low proton fluence in order to pre-evaluate the expected activity\n\n141\n\nafter irradiation. Also in this case the cross section of the beam did totally covered the sample\n\n142\n\nand the beam profile was used to evaluate the effective proton fluence on the target. The loss\n\n143\n\nof protons in the crystal is negligible.\n\n144\n\nA second exposure was performed later with a larger TeO2 crystal of 23 x 22 mm sides and\n\n145\n\n1.6 mm thickness. As for the exposure at 1.4 GeV, the energy loss of the protons inside the\n\n146\n\ntarget was negligible. The cross section of the beam was approximately circular with a radius\n\n147\n\nat half maximum radius of ~ 8 mm. Since the beam did not cover the entire target the\n\n148\n\neffective fluence through it was calculated taking into account, also in this case, the beam\n\n149\n\nprofile.\n\n6\n\n\f1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n\n150\n\nFor radiation safety reasons and in order to avoid transportation from the irradiation zones,\n\n151\n\nJ-ray spectroscopy for the CERN irradiated samples was first performed for period of a few\n\n152\n\nmonths after exposure by the Irradiation Facility of CERN with standard CANBERRA Ge\n\n153\n\nspectrometers with relative efficiency of up to 40% (with respect to that of a 7.62 x 7.62 cm\n\n154\n\nNaI detector). However, since the presence of long-living isotopes is more relevant for a low-\n\n155\n\nbackground underground experiments like CUORE, the sample irradiated at 1.4 GeV and the\n\n156\n\nsecond one of those irradiated at 23 GeV were shipped to Milan years after the exposure,\n\n157\n\nwhen the activity due to the short-living isotopes had sufficiently decreased.\n\n158\n\nThe irradiated samples were then analyzed with two high purity germanium detectors,\n\n159\n\none of a30% and the other one of a60% relative efficiency. The energy resolutions of the two\n\n160\n\ndetectors at 1.33 MeV were 1.77 keV and 2.01 keV FWHM, respectively. All detectors were\n\n161\n\noperated in the low-radioactivity laboratory of the Italian National Institute for Nuclear\n\n162\n\nPhysics (INFN) and of the University of Milano-Bicocca in the basement of the Territorial\n\n163\n\nand Environmental Science Department.\n\n164\n\nMonte Carlo simulations were done in order to correctly evaluate the HPGe absolute\n\n165\n\ndetection efficiency (Habs) considering the relative position of the samples with respect to the\n\n166\n\ndetector. The efficiency of the detector for the analyzed radioisotopes was reconstructed with\n\n167\n\nthe aim of evaluate all possible aspects, especially those connected with coincidence summing\n\n168\n\neffect that can influence the full energy peak efficiency for some radionuclides (for example:\n\n169\n\nthe complete decay scheme of\n\n60\n\nCo, 65Zn, 54Mn, 102mRh and 110mAg were considered).\n\n170\n\nThe software utilized named Jazzy, is based on GEANT4 [9]. This code has been tested by\n\n171\n\nexposing our detectors to several certified gamma ray sources (point like and extended) of the\n\n172\n\nItalian Authority ENEA and found to reproduce the entire spectrum (50 keV up to 2.5 MeV)\n\n173\n\nwithin 5% error [6]. Taking into account the irregular shape of samples, it was assumed a\n\n174\n\nsystematic error of 10% in the overall gamma ray efficiency.\n\n7\n\n\f1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n\n175\n\nThe spectra obtained with the J-ray measurements performed 4.58 and 2.83 years after\n\n176\n\nthe exposures at 1.4 and 23 GeV are reported in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. They clearly\n\n177\n\nshow the presence of long-living isotopes produced by proton activation. Identifications of the\n\n178\n\nmajor peaks produced by the irradiation are also indicated (Figures 2b and 3b).\n\n179\n\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\n180\n\nOur primary aim was to determine the production cross sections of long-lived isotopes,\n\n181\n\nsuch as 60Co, and other long-living nuclei, whose presence could contribute to the background\n\n182\n\nin the energy region of interest (2527 keV in the case of 130Te neutrinoless DBD). The quoted\n\n183\n\nerrors (90% c.l.) include in addition to statistics also the uncertainties on proton fluence and\n\n184\n\ndetector efficiency. The gamma rays produced by the decay of\n\n185\n\nTe targets are initially obscured by the activity of short-lived isotopes and can only be reliably\n\n186\n\nmeasured months or years after the exposures. For completeness, however, we also report our\n\n187\n\nresults for relatively short-lived isotopes, which could play a role in the first period of the\n\n188\n\nunderground experiment, especially if the material was shipped by airplane.\n\n60\n\nCo in the proton-irradiated\n\n189\n\nThe experimental results obtained from the irradiations performed at LANSCE and CERN\n\n190\n\nare reported in Tables II and III, for long and short-living isotopes, respectively. We have\n\n191\n\ncalculated and also reported in the Tables the production cross sections calculated using the\n\n192\n\nlatest version of the semi-empirical formulae of Silberberg and Tsao (S&T) [10,11] (using\n\n193\n\nthe YIELDX routine). We note that the code only calculates cross sections for a specific\n\n194\n\ndaughter to be produced from a specific target. Thus, to determine each production cross\n\n195\n\nsection as defined above, calculations must be performed for each naturally occurring target\n\n196\n\nisotope yielding the daughter nuclide as well as all short-lived precursors that decay to the\n\n197\n\ndaughter of interest. In the S&T calculations, no discrimination is made between meta-stable\n\n198\n\nand ground states.\n\n8\n\n\f1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n\n199\n\nBefore comparing our results with predictions, we would like to stress that the evaluation\n\n200\n\nof Silberberg and Tsao is based on the hypothesis of activation by spallation [55]. This is\n\n201\n\ndefinitely correct for product nuclei with atomic weight significantly different from those of\n\n202\n\nthe isotopes of Tellurium, but not when A is close to them. We found in fact an important\n\n203\n\npresence of the isotopes 121Te, 121mTe, 123Te and 129Te due to the large cross section of thermal\n\n204\n\nneutrons which were present during irradiation. A similar consideration applies to the\n\n205\n\nproduction of\n\n206\n\nreactions by fast neutrons on the\n\n207\n\nabundance (4.816, 7.14 and 18.95% , respectively). For this reason we have not reported data\n\n208\n\non the cross section for the production of all these isotopes.\n\n209\n\n124\n\nSb,\n\n125\n\n126\n\nSb, and\n\nSb where one can expect a large contribution from (n,p)\n\n124\n\nTe,\n\n125\n\n126\n\nTe and\n\nTe nuclei which have a large isotopic\n\n48\n\nWe would like to note that for two isotopes,\n\nV and\n\n103\n\nRu, there is a cumulative effect\n48\n\n210\n\nwhich could increase the estimated production. In addition to the direct production,\n\n211\n\nproduced by E+/EC decays from 48Fe => 48Mn => 48Cr =>48V while 103Ru could be produced\n\n212\n\nby E- decays from\n\n213\n\nhave evaluated the expected direct activation cross sections of\n\n214\n\nsum them to get cumulative cross section for\n\n215\n\nactivation cross section for\n\n216\n\nmeasured are typically within a factor 2 of each other, as was also reported in previous\n\n217\n\npublished paper on proton spallation reactions on Te [35,36]. Larger deviations from the\n\n218\n\ncalculated values and the experimentally measured ones are found for different nuclei and for\n\n219\n\ndifferent proton energies by Yu. T. Titarenko et al [29].\n\n220\n\n4. CONCLUSIONS\n\n103\n\nY =>\n\n103\n\nZr => 103Nb =>\n\n103\n\nV is\n\nMo => 103Tc => 103Ru. For this reason we\n48\n\nFe,\n\n48\n\nMn,\n\n48\n\nCr and\n\n48\n\nV and\n\n48\n\nV. The same has been done to evaluate the\n\n103\n\nRu. As can be seen from the Tables, the calculated and\n\n221\n\nThe above reported cross sections can be used to evaluate the contribution by cosmic ray\n\n222\n\nactivation of TeO2 crystals to the background of CUORE.

A rough evaluation\n\n226\n\nof the initial activity of these isotopes in TeO2 crystals is obtained using the cross sections\n\n227\n\nreported in Table II and binning the cosmic ray spectrum at sea level accordingly. For an\n\n228\n\naverage exposure of 45 days, we obtain an activity of about 2 x 10-8 Bq/kg in 60Co and 4 x 10-\n\n229\n\n6\n\n230\n\ntime varies between 5 and 1 years depending on the crystal production batch) by a factor 2\n\n231\n\n(for\n\n232\n\npreliminary evaluations - is at least one order of magnitude below the target counting rate for\n\n233\n\nCUORE.\n\n234\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nBq/kg in 110mAg.
