Generalizing\nthe classical criterion of Matsusaka, Ran gives in [11] a characterization of\nJacobians by the existence of curves with minimal cohomology class in the\nabelian variety. This criterion is nowadays known as the Matsusaka-Ran\ncriterion.\nMore recently, G. Pareschi and M. Popa use the theory of Fourier-Mukai\ntransforms as a useful tool in the study of the existence of subvarieties of\na principal polarized abelian variety with minimal cohomology class. In\nthis sense, they prove in [10] a cohomological criterion which claims that\nif (A, \u0398) is an indecomposable principal polarized abelian variety and C is\na geometrically non-degenerated reduced equidimensional curve in A, such\nthat the ideal sheaf IC (\u0398) satisfies a Generic Vanishing property, then (A, \u0398)\nis the Jacobian of C and C has minimal cohomology class. In the same paper\nthey conjecture that if the Index Theorem with index 0 holds for IC (2\u0398),\nwith respect to the Fourier-Mukai transform defined by the Poincar\u00e9 bundle,\nDate: June 21, 2018.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nA. C. L\u00d3PEZ MART\u00cdN, E. C. MISTRETTA, AND D. S\u00c1NCHEZ G\u00d3MEZ\n\nthen C has minimal cohomology class. Consequently, using the MatsusakaRan criterion, this would give a different cohomogical criterion for detecting\nJacobians.\nIn this paper, we show the existence of such curves of minimal class using\nPicard bundles.\nPicard bundles were introduced by Schwarzenberger in [12] and have been\nused by many authors in the study of the geometry of abelian varieties (c.f\n[4], [2]). Mukai studied Picard bundles by means of Fourier-Mukai transforms in (c.f. [6]). We extend his definition of Picard bundles in order\nto consider Fourier-Mukai transforms of any line bundle, and study some\nproperties of these sheaves in Proposition 2.4.\nThe fact that the locus of Jacobians is detected by the presence of Picard\nbundles appears in Kempf's work (cf. [4] and [5]). He shows that the\nprojective bundle associated to a Picard bundle is the symmetric product\nof the curve, and that deformations of Picard bundles are Picard bundles\n(this is proved independently by Mukai). He shows furthermore that the\ndeformations of Jacobians carrying a deformation of the symmetric power\nof the curve (as a projective bundle on the Jacobian) are exactly those\ncoming from deformations of the curve. In this way, the presence of Picard\nbundles characterizes Jacobians among p.p.a.v.'s.\nWith the use of Fourier-Mukai transform and vanishing properties, we\ncarry out this description of the Jacobian locus explicitely, determining\nthose properties of Picard bundles that allow to detect Jacobians. Moreover the Fourier-Mukai techniques give a quick and clean way to recover\nknown results about Picard bundles.\nOur main result is the following:\nTheorem . Let (A, \u0398) be an indecomposable p.p.a.v. of dimension g. If\n\u03b8i\nthere exists a WITg sheaf F on A with Chern classes ci (F) = (\u22121)i , then\ni!\n(A, \u0398) is a Jacobian and a direct summand of F is a Picard bundle.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are very grateful to G. Pareschi and M. Popa for proposing us this\nproblem during the summer school PRAGMATIC 2007. We would like to\nthank them for their lectures, useful conversations and the constant encouragement. We would like to thank all the organizers of PRAGMATIC 2007\nas well, for making possible this very intense and interesting conference.\n1.

In his original paper [6], Mukai consider instead of \u03a6\nb\nb\nb \u2212\u2192 D (A) defined by P.

A coherent sheaf F on A is WITi with respect to \u03a6 (WITi \u03a6 for short) if \u03a6j (F) = 0 for all j 6= i, or equivalently if there exists a sheaf\nb such that \u03a6(F) \u2243 F[\u2212i].\nb\nFb on A\nThe sheaf Fb is called the Fourier-Mukai\ntransform of F with respect to \u03a6.

Let F be a coherent sheaf on A. Then, the following\nholds:\n1. F is ITi -\u03a6 if and only if H j (A, F \u2297 P\u03b1 ) = 0 for all j 6= i and for\nb\nall \u03b1 \u2208 A.\n2.

If F is an ample line bundle, then it is IT0 -\u03a6.\n\n\f4\n\nA. C. L\u00d3PEZ MART\u00cdN, E. C. MISTRETTA, AND D. S\u00c1NCHEZ G\u00d3MEZ\n\nProof. Since P is a locally free sheaf, 1) and 2) follow in a straightforward\nway from Grauert's cohomology and base change theorem. Part 3) follows\nb \u25e6 \u03a6 \u2243 [\u2212g] and part 4) is a consequence of 3) and\nfrom the isomorphism \u03a6\nthe definition of IT. Part 5) is a consequence of the fact that ample line\nbundles on abelian varieties have no higher cohomology (see for instance [8,\nIII.16]) and 1).\n\u0003\nThe relationship between the Chern characters of a WIT sheaf and those\nof its Fourier-Mukai transform is given by the following formula.\nMukai's formula([7, Corollary 1.18]): If E is a WITj -\u03a6 sheaf, then\n(1)\n\nb = (\u22121)i+j P D(chg\u2212i (E))\nchi (E)\n\nwhere P D denotes the Poincar\u00e9 duality isomorphism.\nDefinition 1.5. A principally polarized abelian variety (p.p.a.v. for short)\nis an abelian variety A endowed with an ample line bundle L such that\n\u03c7(L) = 1.\nRemark 1.6. If A is an abelian variety and we denote by \u03c4x the translation\nmorphism by a point x \u2208 X, recall that A is a p.p.a.v. if and only if there\nb\nexists an ample line bundle L on A such that the morphism \u03c6L : A \u2192 A\n\u22121\n\u2217\ndefined as \u03c6L (x) = \u03c4x L \u2297 L is an isomorphism. Moreover, by Proposition\n1.4, the polarization L is IT0 , and it satisfies\nb \u2243 L\u22121 .\n(2)\n\u03c6\u2217L (L)\n2. Picard Bundles on Jacobians\n\nIn this section we define Picard bundles via Fourier-Mukai transforms, and\ndetermine those properties of theirs allowing us to characterize Jacobians\namong p.p.a.v.'s.\nLet C be a smooth curve of genus g \u2265 2 and consider Jd (C) the Picard\nscheme parametrizing line bundles of degree d on C. This is a fine moduli\nspace. Denote by Pd the universal Poincar\u00e9 line bundle on the direct product\nC \u00d7Jd (C) and p : C \u00d7Jd (C) \u2192 C and q : C \u00d7Jd (C) \u2192 Jd (C) the projections.\nFixing a point x0 \u2208 C, it is normalized by imposing Pd|{x0 }\u00d7Jd \u2243 OJd . The\nhigher direct images Ri q\u2217 (Pd ) of Pd on Jd (C) are known in the literature\nas degree d Picard sheaves.\nLet us show how Picard sheaves can be seen in terms of the FourierMukai transform. Let J0 (C) = J(C) be the Jacobian of C, that is, the\nabelian variety that parametrizes the line bundles on C with degree zero.\nThe Riemann theta divisor \u0398 is a natural polarization on J(C) that defines\na structure of principally polarized abelian variety of dimension g on J(C).\nBy Remark 1.6, this gives a natural identification between J(C) and its dual\n[ With this identification, if we denote by\nabelian variety J(C).\na : C \u0592\u2192 J(C)\n\n\fCHARACTERIZATION OF JACOBIANS VIA PICARD BUNDLES\n\n5\n\nthe Abel morphism, the normalized Poincar\u00e9 bundle P0 is precisely the\nrestriction (a \u00d7 1)\u2217 P of the universal line bundle P on J(C) \u00d7 J(C). On\nthe other hand, the line bundle Pd \u2297 p\u2217 OC (\u2212dx0 ) defines an isomorphism\n\u223c\n\u03bbd : Jd (C) \u2192 J(C) and by normalization of the Poincar\u00e9 sheaves that we\nhave considered, one has isomorphisms\nPd \u2243 (1 \u00d7 \u03bbd )\u2217 P0 \u2297 p\u2217 OC (dx0 ) .\nUsing the base-change and the projection formulas, the Picard sheaf\nRi q\u2217 (Pd ) is\nRi q\u2217 (Pd ) \u2243 \u03bb\u2217d \u03a6i (a\u2217 OC (dx0 )) .\nConsidering that all Jacobians are already identified and although the\nlast isomorphism is no longer true for an arbitrary line bundle L of degree\nd, the above discussion justifies the following definition of Picard sheaves.\nDefinition 2.1. Let L be a line bundle on C of degree d. The sheaves\n\u03a6i (a\u2217 L) are called the degree d Picard sheaves.\nRemark 2.2. The use of Fourier-Mukai transforms in the study of Picard\nbundles is originally due to Mukai [6]. In this paper, he just considers the\nPicard sheaf Fd = \u03a61 (a\u2217 OC (dx0 )) corresponding to the line bundle OC (dx0 ).\nRemark 2.3. Let \u2206 : D b (J(C)) \u2192 D b (J(C)) be the dualizing functor defined by \u2206(F \u2022 ) = RHom(F \u2022 , OJ(C) )[g]. From Grothendieck duality, there\nis an isomorphism of functors\n\u2206 \u25e6 \u03a6 \u2243 ((\u22121)\u2217 \u25e6 \u03a6 \u25e6 \u2206)[g] .\nTaking into account that if L is a line bundle on C, its derived dual is\n\u2206(a\u2217 L) \u2243 a\u2217 (L\u2217 \u2297 \u03c9C )[1] where \u03c9C is dualizing sheaf of C, one has an\nisomorphism\n(3)\n\nRHom((\u03a6(a\u2217 L), OJ(C)) )) \u2243 (\u22121)\u2217 \u03a6(a\u2217 (L\u2217 \u2297 \u03c9C ))[1] .\n\nwhich, in some cases, gives a duality relation between degree d and degree\n2g \u2212 2 \u2212 d Picard bundles.\nApplying the theory of Fourier-Mukai transforms, we get some properties\nof Picard sheaves that we summarize in the following proposition (cf. Theorem 4.2 and Proposition 4.3 in [6], properties of Picard sheaves as defined\nby Mukai).\nProposition 2.4. The following holds:\n1. \u03a6i (a\u2217 L) are zero for i 6= 0, 1.\n2. For d < 0, \u03a60 (a\u2217 L) = 0 and \u03a61 (a\u2217 L) is simple locally free of rank\ng \u2212 d \u2212 1. There is an isomorphism\n\u03a61 (a\u2217 L) \u2243 (\u22121)\u2217 Hom((\u03a60 (a\u2217 (L\u2217 \u2297 \u03c9C )), OJ(C) )) .\n3. For 0 \u2264 d < g \u2212 1, \u03a61 (a\u2217 L) is supported on J(C).\n4. For g \u2212 1 \u2264 d < 2g \u2212 1, \u03a60 (a\u2217 L) and \u03a61 (a\u2217 L) are both non-zero.\n\n\f6\n\nA. C.

There is an isomorphism\n\u03a60 (a\u2217 L) \u2243 (\u22121)\u2217 Hom(\u03a61 (a\u2217 (L\u2217 \u2297 \u03c9C )), OJ(C) ) .\nProof. The first part is because the support of L has dimension 1. If d < 0,\nfrom Grauert's cohomology and base-change theorem \u03a60 (a\u2217 L) = 0 and\n\u03a61 (a\u2217 L) is a locally free sheaf of rank g \u2212 d \u2212 1. Since \u03a6 is an equivalence of categories and L is simple, \u03a6(a\u2217 L)[1] = \u03a61 (a\u2217 L) is simple as well.\nAnalogously, one gets the corresponding statements in 5). In both cases,\nthe duality relation between degree d and degree 2g \u2212 2 \u2212 d Picard bundles\nis a consequence of the equation (3). Let us show 3). By cohomology and\nbase-change, one has that \u03a61 (a\u2217 L)\u03b1 \u2243 H 1 (C, L \u2297 P\u03b1 ) which, being L \u2297 P\u03b1\nof degree d, is non-zero for every \u03b1 \u2208 J(C) because \u03c7(L \u2297 P\u03b1 ) < 0 by\nRiemman-Roch theorem. Now we prove 4). By the equation (3), there is an\nisomorphism\n\u03a60 (a\u2217 L) \u2243 (\u22121)\u2217 Hom\u22121 ((\u03a6(a\u2217 (L\u2217 \u2297 \u03c9C )), OJ(C) )) .\nFrom 3), the sheaf \u03a61 (a\u2217 (L\u2217 \u2297\u03c9C )) is supported on J(C), and then the sheaf\nHom0 (\u03a61 (a\u2217 (L\u2217 \u2297 \u03c9C )), OJ(C) )) is non-zero. From the spectral sequence for\nlocal homomorphims\nE2p,q = Homp (\u03a6\u2212q (a\u2217 (L\u2217 \u2297\u03c9C )), OJ(C) )) \u21d2\np+q\nE\u221e\n= Homp+q (\u03a6(a\u2217 (L\u2217 \u2297 \u03c9C )), OJ(C) )) .\n\nand the above isomorphism we easily conclude that \u03a60 (a\u2217 L) is non-zero.\nFinally, to show that \u03a61 (a\u2217 L) is also non-zero, consider the line bundle\nL \u2297 OC (\u2212dx0 ), where x0 is the point of C that we have fixed to normalize\nthe Poincar\u00e9 bundle. This is a line bundle of degree zero and then L \u2297\nOC (\u2212dx0 ) \u2243 P\u03b1 for some \u03b1 \u2208 J(C). By Theorem 4.2 in [6], there is a point\n\u03ba \u2208 J(C) in the support of the sheaf \u03a61 (OC (dx0 )). Using again cohomology\nand base-change, one obtains that\nH 1 (C, OC (dx0 ) \u2297 P\u03ba ) \u2243 H 1 (C, L \u2297 P\u03ba\u2212\u03b1 )\nis non-zero. Hence, the point \u03ba \u2212 \u03b1 belongs to the support of \u03a61 (a\u2217 L) and\nwe have the result.\n\u0003\nWe will use the following\nLemma 2.5. Let E be a vector bundle on a smooth variety X. The following\nare equivalent:\na) chj (E) = 0 for all j \u2265 2.\nc1 (E)i\nfor all i.\nb) ci (E) =\ni!\nProof. By definition the total Chern class of E is\nr\nY\n(1 + ai t)\nct (E) = c0 (E) + c1 (E)t + c2 (E)t2 + * * * + cr (E)tr =\ni=1\n\n\fCHARACTERIZATION OF JACOBIANS VIA PICARD BUNDLES\n\n7\n\nand the Chern character is\nr\n\u0011\nX\nX\u0010\n(ai t)2\neai t =\n1 + ai t +\n+ * * * = r + ch1 (E)t + * * *\nch(E) =\n2!\ni=1\n\nc1 (E)i\nwe get that ct (E) = ec1 (E)t . Then\ni!\nX\nc1 (E)t = log(ct (E)) =\nlog(1 + ai t) =\nX\n(ai t)2 (ai t)3\n=\n(ai t \u2212\n+\n+ ***) =\n2\n3\n= ch1 (E)t \u2212 ch2 (E)t2 + 2 ch3 (E)t3 \u2212 3 ch4 (E)t4 + * * *\n\nSo, if ci (E) =\n\nHence chj (E) = 0 for any j \u2265 2.\nConversely, if we assume that chj (E) = 0 for all j \u2265 2, then one obtains\nr\nY\nlog( (1 + ai t)) = c1 (E)t\ni=1\n\nwhich implies the condition b).\n\n\u0003\n\nConsider now the line bundle L = OC (2\u0398) \u2208 J2g (C). By the proposition\n\\\nabove, the Picard sheaf \u03a60 (a\u2217 OC (2\u0398)) = a\u2217 O\nC (2\u0398) is a vector bundle on\nJ(C).\nThe aim of this section is to show some of the properties that this Picard\nbundle has:\n\\\nProposition 2.6. If F = a\u2217 O\nC (2\u0398), then\n\\\n1. F is a quotient of OJ(C)\n(2\u0398).\nb\n2. F is WITg -\u03a6.\n\u03b8i\n3. ci (F) = (\u22121)i .\ni!\n4. F is simple.\nProof. Let us consider the exact sequence\n(4)\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 IC (2\u0398) \u2212\u2192 OJ(C) (2\u0398) \u2212\u2192 a\u2217 OC (2\u0398) \u2212\u2192 0\n\nSince \u0398 is an ample divisor, the line bundle OJ(C) (2\u0398) \u2297 P\u03b1 is also ample\nfor any \u03b1 \u2208 J(C). Thus, by applying the vanishing results for ample line\nbundles on an abelian variety (see for instance [8, III.16]), we get that\nH i (J(C), OJ(C) (2\u0398) \u2297 P\u03b1 ) = 0 for all i > 0 and all \u03b1 \u2208 J(C)\nand, by Proposition 1.4, one concludes that OJ(C) (2\u0398) is IT0 -\u03a6. On the\nother hand, Theorem 4.1 in [9] proves that the sheaf IC (2\u0398) is IT0 -\u03a6 as\nwell.\nBy applying the Fourier-Mukai transform \u03a6 to exact sequence (4) we then\nobtain\n\\\n\\\n(5)\n0 \u2212\u2192 I\\\nC (2\u0398) \u2212\u2192 OJ(C) (2\u0398) \u2212\u2192 a\u2217 OC (2\u0398) \u2212\u2192 0\n\n\f8\n\nA. C. L\u00d3PEZ MART\u00cdN, E. C. MISTRETTA, AND D. S\u00c1NCHEZ G\u00d3MEZ\n\n\\\nThe next step is to compute the Chern classes of a\u2217 O\nC (2\u0398). In fact, this\ncomputation is originally due to Schwarzenberger [12]. Here we deduce it\nusing the Fourier-Mukai transform.\nThe Chern characters of a\u2217 OC (2\u0398) can be obtained using the Grothendieck\na\nRiemann Roch theorem for the Abel morphism C \u0592\u2192 J(C)\nch(a\u2217 OC (2\u0398)) * td(J(C)) = a\u2217 (ch(OC (2\u0398|C )) * td(C))\nRemember that C has minimal cohomology class, that is,\n[C] =\n\n\u03b8 g\u22121\n(g \u2212 1)!\n\nand the Todd class of J(C) is trivial because it\none gets\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 g\u22121\n\u03b8\n(6)\nchj (a\u2217 OC (2\u0398)) =\n\uf8f4\n(g \u2212 1)!\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3g + 1\n\nis an abelian variety.

A Characterization of Jacobians via Picard Bundles\nIn this section we shall use the Matsusaka-Ran criterion to prove that the\nexistence of a sheaf satisfying properties 2) and 3) of the Picard bundle in\nProposition 2.6 is enough to ensure that an indecomposable p.p.a.v. is the\nJacobian of a curve. Let us introduce some necessary notions and recall the\nMatsusaka-Ran criterion.\nLet C be an irreducible, or more generally connected, curve on an abelian\nvariety A. Some translate of C generates (group-theoretically) an abelian\nsubvariety of A which we denote by hCi and we call the abelian subvariety\ngenerated by C.\n\n\fCHARACTERIZATION OF JACOBIANS VIA PICARD BUNDLES\n\n9\n\nDefinition 3.1. A connected curve C on an abelian variety A is P\nsaid to\ngenerate A, if hCi = A. More generally, an effective algebraic 1-cycle\nn i Ci\non A, with ni > 0 for all ni , generates A, if the union of the curves Ci\ngenerates A.\nThe following is the statement of the Matsusaka-Ran criterion ([1, Theorem 11.8.1], see also [11, Theorem 3]).\nTheorem 3.2 (Criterion of Matsusaka-Ran). Suppose (A, \u0398) is a polarized\nr\nX\nni Ci is an effective 1-cycle\nabelian variety of dimension g and C =\ni=1\n\ngenerating A with [C] * \u0398 = g. Then ni = 1 for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r, the curves\nCi are smooth, and (A, \u0398) is isomorphic to the product of the canonically\npolarized Jacobians of the Ci\u2032 s:\n(A, \u0398) \u2243 (J(C1 ), \u03981 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 (J(Cr ), \u0398r )\nIn particular, if C is an irreducible curve generating A with [C] * \u0398 = g, then\nC is smooth and (A, \u0398) is the Jacobian of C.\nThus, the criterion that characterizes Jacobians by the existence of Picard\nbundles is the following\nTheorem 3.3. Let (A, \u0398) be an indecomposable p.p.a.v. of dimension g.\nSuppose that there exists a sheaf F on A that satisfies the following conditions:\nb\n1. F is WITg -\u03a6.\n\u03b8i\n2. ci (F) = (\u22121)i .\ni!\nThen there exists a smooth curve C in A such that (A, \u0398) \u2243 (J(C), \u0398).\nMoreover, if the sheaf F is indecomposable, then it is a simple degree rk(F)+\ng \u2212 1 Picard bundle with rk(F) \u2265 g.\nProof. Consider Fb the Fourier-Mukai transform of F. Denote by Z =\nsupp(Fb) the support of Fb and i : Z \u0592\u2192 A the natural inclusion. Then,\nFb \u2243 i\u2217 G for some sheaf G on Z.\nWe recall that a WITg sheaf is locally free (Proposition 1.4). Using\nLemma 2.5 and Mukai's formula (1), we compute the components of the\nChern character of Fb getting that\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n0\nj <g\u22121\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 g\u22121\n\u03b8\n(9)\nchj (Fb) =\nj =g\u22121\n\uf8f4\n(g\n\u2212 1)!\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3rk(F)\nj=g\nThis proves that Z is a subscheme of codimension g \u2212 1. Define now the\n1-cycle\nX\nZ1 (Fb) =\nlV (Fb)[V ]\ndim V =1\n\n\f10\n\nA. C. L\u00d3PEZ MART\u00cdN, E. C. MISTRETTA, AND D. S\u00c1NCHEZ G\u00d3MEZ\n\nwhere the sum is over all 1-dimensional subvarieties in Z and lV (Fb) is the\nlength of the stalk of Fb.\nAs a consequence of Grothendieck-Riemman-Roch theorem (c.f. [3, Theorem 18.3, Example 18.3.11]), it is known that\nb + higher degree terms .\nch(Fb) = Z1 (F)\n\nHence the effective 1-cycle Z1 (Fb) on A satisfies\nZ1 (Fb) =\n\n\u03b8 g\u22121\n(g \u2212 1)!\n\nThis implies that this 1-cycle generates A, by Corollary II.2, Corollary II.3\nand Lemma II.10 in [11]. Finally, since (A, \u0398) is indecomposable, and\n[Z] =\n\n\u03b8 g\u22121\n,\n(g \u2212 1)!\n\nthen Z is irreducible via the Poincar\u00e9 duality. The Matsusaka-Ran criterion\nallows us to conclude that the abelian variety (A, \u0398) is the Jacobian of a\nsmooth curve, which proves the first part of the theorem.\nAssume now that the sheaf F is indecomposable. According to the previous discussion, the support Z = C \u2294 W , where C is the smooth curve and\nW is a 0-dimensional closed subscheme. Since Fb \u2243 i\u2217 G is also indecomposable, then Z = C, the inclusion i is \u00b1a : C \u0592\u2192 J(C), where a is the Abel\nmorphism, and G is a torsion free sheaf on C. By applying GrothendieckRiemman-Roch theorem to Fb \u2243 i\u2217 G, we get\ni\u2217 (rk(G)) =\n\n\u03b8 g\u22121\n(g \u2212 1)!\n\nand\n\ni\u2217 (c1 (G) \u2212\n\n1\nrk(G)KC ) = rk(F)\n2\n\nKC being a canonical divisor of C. Thus, i = a and G is a line bundle on C\nof degree rk(F) + g \u2212 1. From Proposition 1.4 a\u2217 G is IT0 -\u03a6 and then F is\nsimple and rk(F) \u2265 g by Proposition 2.4.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.4. The same proof shows that when (A, \u0398) is decomposable,\nit is isomorphic to the direct product of the Jacobians of the irreducible\ncomponents of Z1 (Fb).\n\nRemark 3.5. When F is not indecomposable, we can show by the same\nargument that it is the direct sum of a Picard bundle (the transform of\nFb|C ) and a vector bundle obtained as a chain of extensions of degree 0 line\nbundles (the transform of Fb|W ).\nReferences\n\n[1] C.
