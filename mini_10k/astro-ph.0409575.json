Analysis of the SN 1998bw data showed that this was a peculiar\nType Ic supernova (SN Ic; see Filippenko 1997 for a summary of SN classifications), with\na very large explosion energy, some 30\u201350 times the energy of an ordinary core-collapse SN\n(1051 erg). For this reason, SN 1998bw was called a \"hypernova\" (Iwamoto et al. 1998;\nNakamura et al. 2001).\nWhile an effort was made to establish whether other SNe were linked to GRBs (Wang &\nWheeler 1998), additional SNe were studied which show the typical characteristics of \"hypernovae,\" namely a high kinetic energy per unit mass, exemplified by broad spectral features;\nsee Mazzali et al. (2003a), and references therein. Since not all of them are extremely luminous, but are spectrally similar to SN 1998bw, they have also been dubbed \"SN 1998bw-like\nSNe Ic\" (Foley et al. 2003).\nAnalysis of one of these objects in particular, SN 1997ef, showed that its kinetic energy\nis \u223c 2 \u00d7 1052 erg, less than the energy of SN 1998bw but still very large (Iwamoto et al. 2000;\nMazzali et al. 2000). SN 1997ef was estimated to have synthesized \u223c 0.13 M\u2299 of 56 Ni, or\nabout twice the amount produced by normal core-collapse SNe, although again less than that\nof SN 1998bw. A clear connection with a GRB could not be established for SN 1997ef, yet a\npossible candidate was found (GRB 971115; Wang & Wheeler 1998). The common features\nof SNe 1997ef and 1998bw are the broad absorption troughs in the spectra near maximum\nbrightness, indicating the presence of high-velocity ejecta, and the luminous and extended\nlight curve. Other examples of SN 1998bw-like SNe Ic are SN 2003dh/GRB030329 (Stanek\net al. 2003; Hjorth et al. 2003; Matheson et al. 2003; Mazzali et al. 2003b; Kawabata et al.\n2003), which was very similar to SN 1998bw; SN 2002ap (Mazzali et al. 2002; Leonard et al.\n2002; Foley et al. 2003), which was less energetic and is thought to have synthesized only\n\u223c 0.08 M\u2299 of 56 Ni; and recently SN 2003lw/GRB031203 (Tagliaferri et al. 2004; Malesani\net al. 2004).\nThe study of SN 1998bw extended to late times. The spectrum turned nebular after \u223c\n100 days, while the light curve showed a phase of exponential decline. This can be interpreted\nas being due to the presence of an inner high-density region (Nakamura et al. 2001; Nomoto\net al. 2001; Maeda et al. 2003). The fully nebular spectrum of SN 1998bw showed broad\nlines, with the peculiarity that the oxygen lines were narrower than the iron lines. This\nis difficult to interpret in the context of a 1-dimensional, spherically symmetric model, but\nit can be explained if the explosion was asymmetric (Mazzali et al. 2001; Maeda et al.\n2002). On the contrary, SN 1997ef retained a photospheric-type spectrum, with absorption\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nlines of progressively lower velocity, up to the last previously studied spectrum, dating \u223c 2\nmonths after the explosion (Mazzali et al. 2000), when some evidence of nebular emission\nis also present. The long duration of the photospheric phase can also be interpreted as the\nconsequence of the presence of an inner, high-density region, but in this case the density\ncontrast between such a region and the outer ejecta may be larger (Maeda et al. 2003).\nIn this paper, we analyze spectra of SN 1997ef extending beyond the previous study\n(to epochs of \u223c 3\u20134 months), and show that at comparable epochs, while SN 1998bw had\na fully nebular spectrum, SN 1997ef still retains a photosphere. We study these spectra\nwith a double-barreled approach, dividing them into a photospheric and a nebular part, and\nobtain an estimate of the mass of 56 Ni powering the spectrum at these intermediate epochs.\nUnfortunately, no good spectra of SN 1997ef exist at later times. However, another peculiar\nSN Ic, SN 1997dq, was shown by Matheson et al. (2001) to be very similar to SN 1997ef.\nCombining the light curves of these two SNe we generate a \"SN 1997ef-like\" extended light\ncurve. This is particularly useful because SN 1997dq does have a good-quality spectrum\nobtained in the fully nebular epoch (\u223c 300 days). This spectrum can thus be used to\ndetermine directly the mass of 56 Ni produced by SN 1997dq and, by analogy, by SN 1997ef.\nThis can be compared to the result obtained from the light curve near peak.\n\n2.\n\nThe Intermediate-Epoch Spectra of SN 1997ef\n\nSN 1997ef, a peculiar SN Ic, was classified as a hypernova both by Branch (2001), who\nfound a kinetic energy of \u223c 3 \u00d7 1052 erg from spectral fits, and by Iwamoto et al. (2000), who\nderived from a simultaneous study of the light curve and the spectra the values Ekin = 8\u00d71051\nerg, Mej = 8 M\u2299 , and M(56 Ni)= 0.15 M\u2299 . Iwamoto et al. suggested that SN 1997ef was the\nresult of the collapse of the stripped CO core of a star having a zero-age main sequence\n(ZAMS) mass of \u223c 30\u201335M\u2299 . Following the probable association between SN 1998bw and\nGRB 980425, Wang & Wheeler (1998) looked for other possible associations between SNe\nand GRBs, and suggested that GRB 971115 may be compatible with SN 1997ef in position\nand time of occurrence, although the correlation is much weaker than for SN 1998bw and\nGRB 980425 and thus the link between the SN and the GRB cannot be proved.\nMazzali et al. (2000) analyzed a series of photospheric-epoch spectra of SN 1997ef.\nUsing spectroscopic dating on the 1997 Nov. 29 spectrum (UT dates are used throughout\nthis paper), they estimated that the explosion occurred on Nov. 20 \u00b11 day. They derived the\ndensity and abundance distributions in the ejecta, and found that typical SN Ic abundances\ndescribe SN 1997ef very well, but their results differed from the explosion model used to\ndescribe the light curve in two ways: (1) the outer density structure turned out to be\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nrather flat (a power law with index n = \u22124), so that the very broad absorption features,\nextending to v \u2248 25000 km s\u22121 , could be reproduced, and (2) matter was found to be\npresent at low velocities (\u223c 2000 km s\u22121 ), which is well below the low-velocity cutoff of the\nspherically symmetric explosion model (5000 km s\u22121 ). Their most important conclusion is\nthat a hypernova model with Ekin = 2 \u00d7 1052 erg, Mej = 10 M\u2299 , and M(56 Ni)= 0.13 M\u2299\n(model CO100) gives a good representation of the light curve and the spectra.\nA synthetic light curve obtained with this modified density structure fits the observations\nnear the peak quite nicely, and Mazzali et al. (2000) suggested that if an additional 0.05 M\u2299\nof 56 Ni is contained at low velocities and high densities, then the observed slowing down\nof the light curve between days 60 and 160 might be explained by the ensuing additional\ndeposition of \u03b3-rays. They also suggested that the distribution of 56 Ni may be aspherical.\nA more conclusive determination of the 56 Ni mass could be obtained from the nebular\nspectra. Mazzali et al. (2000) only extended their study to the first \u223c 2 months. The last\nspectrum they analyzed, dated 1998 Jan. 26, has an epoch of 67 days after the explosion.\nSuperposed on the photospheric spectrum, this spectrum showed net emission in [O i] \u03bb6300,\n[Ca ii] \u03bb7300, and the Ca ii near-infrared triplet, which is typical of SNe Ic.\nMatheson et al. (2001) presented spectra of SN 1997ef obtained at later epochs. Only\ntwo of these spectra can be used for modelling: those observed on 1998 March 7 and March\n26. The 1998 Sep. 21 spectrum is unfortunately too noisy, even after smoothing or rebinning,\nand it has almost no signal in the blue. According to the spectral dating of Mazzali et al.\n(2000), the explosion took place on 1997 Nov. 20; hence, the two useable spectra have epochs\nof 107 and 126 days, respectively. At such epochs, the spectra of SN 1998bw were essentially\nfully nebular. In contrast, for SN 1997ef this is not the case: despite the greatly increased\nstrength of the emission lines, a comparison with the 1998 Jan. 26 spectrum shows that both\nMarch spectra are still dominated by P-Cygni profiles superposed on a cool continuum, which\nis almost flat in the optical. Thus, the March spectra can be divided into two components,\none photospheric and one nebular.\nBecause it is interesting to determine the properties of both components, we modelled the March spectra using a double-barrelled approach: we reproduce the photospheric\ncomponent using our Monte Carlo code (Mazzali 2000), which gives us information on the\nluminosity, the photospheric velocity, and the abundances, but is not able to reproduce net\nnebular line emission. This is then reproduced with our non-LTE (NLTE) nebular spectral\ncode (e.g., Mazzali et al. 2001), from which the 56 Ni mass contributing to powering the nebular spectrum can be determined. The sum of the two component spectra should reproduce\nthe observations.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nWe have therefore adopted the following modelling procedure. First, the spectra were\ncalibrated according to the V magnitude obtained by interpolating the light curve. Second,\nthe spectra were modelled with our photospheric-epoch Monte Carlo code. Finally, the\nremaining net emission was modelled using our NLTE nebular code. The main results are\noutlined in the next two sections.\n\n2.1.\n\n1998 March 7, Day 107\n\nThe photospheric component requires a cool spectrum. The Monte Carlo model requires\nL = 4.8 \u00d7 1041 erg s\u22121 and vph = 1650 km s\u22121 . This, combined with the epoch, gives\nT = 4200 K, and the synthetic spectrum has V = 18.70 mag, B = 19.97 mag, and bolometric\ncorrection (BC) = \u22120.57 mag. Oxygen, silicon, and sulfur dominate the ejecta. The iron\nabundance is small.\nThe synthetic spectrum reproduces reasonably well the blue part of the observed spectrum (\u03bb < 6000 \u00c5), and the P-Cygni lines of O i \u03bb7770, the Ca ii near-IR triplet, and S i\n\u03bb9220. In the synthetic spectrum, the Fe ii feature near 5000 \u00c5 is too deep, and the Ca ii\nnear-IR triplet absorption does not extend far enough in the blue, probably because of our\nmodel grid. The emission features which are not reproduced are as mentioned above for the\n1998 Jan. 26 spectrum (i.e., [O i] \u03bb6300, [Ca ii] \u03bb7300, and the Ca ii near-IR triplet), plus\na weak line near 5550 \u00c5 (probably [O i] \u03bb5577).\nWe modelled the residual emission spectrum trying to fit the strongest uncontaminated\nlines, [O i] \u03bb6300 and [Ca ii] \u03bb7300. The lines are rather narrow, requiring an outer velocity\nof the nebula of 5000 km s\u22121 . Note that at a comparable epoch SN 1998bw had line halfwidths of \u223c 12000 km s\u22121 in both [O i] and [Fe ii]. It is not possible to isolate [Fe ii] emission\nin SN 1997ef, so an estimate of the 56 Ni mass must rely on fitting the [O i] line and not\nexceeding the total observed flux in the [Fe ii] region.\nWe found that a nebula containing 0.05 M\u2299 of 56 Ni, 0.5 M\u2299 of O, 0.4 M\u2299 of Si, and\nsmaller masses of other elements gives a good fit to the observed residual emission spectrum.\nThe line at 6500 \u00c5 is reproduced as [Si i] \u03bb6527.\nSignificant clumping (volume filling factor vf = 0.1) is adopted in analogy with SN 1998bw\n(Mazzali et al. 2001). This is necessary to keep the ionization sufficiently low that [Fe iii]\nlines do not form.\nThe luminosity of the nebular spectrum is 9 \u00d7 1040 erg s\u22121 . This luminosity corresponds\nto a \u03b3-ray deposition fraction D\u03b3 = 0.38 for a 56 Ni mass of 0.05 M\u2299 .\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nFigure 1 shows the observed spectrum, the Monte Carlo synthetic spectrum, the nebular\nspectrum, and the sum of the latter two. The combined synthetic spectrum reproduces the\nobservations well, including an improved fit in the 5000 \u00c5 region. Regions of low line opacity\n(\u223c 6800 \u00c5, > 9600 \u00c5) are not well reproduced because our Monte Carlo model assumes a\nsharp photosphere as the lower boundary. The total luminosity of the spectrum is then\nL = 5.7 \u00d7 1041 erg s\u22121 , or M(Bol) = \u221215.64 mag.\nThe luminosity of the photospheric component alone corresponds to the complete deposition of \u03b3-rays and positron from 0.10 M\u2299 of 56 Ni, indicating that this is the minimum\nvalue of the 56 Ni mass located below vph . The real value is probably larger, as many of the\n\u03b3-rays probably escape. Thus, the total mass of 56 Ni is at least 0.15 M\u2299 .\n\n2.2.\n\n1998 March 26, Day 126\n\nThe differences between this spectrum and the previous one are small. A photosphere\nis still present. The depth of the absorption in the Fe ii region is reduced, and the relative\nimportance of net emission is greater, including now clearly [O i] \u03bb5577.\nThe Monte Carlo model requires L = 4.1 \u00d7 1041 erg s\u22121 and vph = 1350 km s\u22121 . We\nobtain T = 4100 K, and the spectrum has V = 18.93 mag, B = 20.14 mag, and BC = \u22120.63\nmag. The elements O, Si, and S dominate the ejecta. The Fe abundance is smaller than on\nMarch 7. The fit is similar to that of March 7.\nThe nebula has v = 5000 km s\u22121 , and it contains 0.05 M\u2299 of 56 Ni, 0.7 M\u2299 of O, 0.4 M\u2299\nof Si, and smaller masses of other elements. Clumping is again assumed. The nebular\nspectrum has L = 7 \u00d7 1040 erg s\u22121 , i.e., D\u03b3 = 0.35. The O mass changes significantly in the\ntwo models, while other masses do not. Unfortunately, determinations of the O mass are\nintrinsically very uncertain (e.g., Mazzali et al. 2001), and the values derived here should be\nregarded as only approximate. The combined synthetic spectrum is a reasonably good fit to\nthe observed one (Figure 2).\nThe total luminosity of the spectrum is L = 4.8 \u00d7 1041 erg s\u22121 , i.e., M(Bol) = \u221215.50\nmag. The luminosity of the photospheric component corresponds to the complete deposition\nof \u223c 0.1 M\u2299 of 56 Ni, confirming that the total mass of 56 Ni should be at least 0.15 M\u2299 .\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n3.\n\nLight Curve\n\nIn Figure 3 we show the new extended light curve of SN 1997ef. The \"bolometric\" light\ncurve was derived from the model fits, not from integrating the spectra. The BC changes\nfrom negative to positive on about day 60, and the bolometric light curve is brighter and\nsomewhat flatter than the V light curve at advanced epochs. The bolometric light curve\nbetween 1998 Mar. 7 and Mar. 26 (days 107\u2013126) is only slightly steeper than the 56 Co\ndecay slope. The luminosity for Jan. 26 (day 67) is the result of modelling the photospheric\nspectrum only, and it does not include net emission which is present. Its value is therefore\nsomewhat underestimated.\nThe late-time bolometric light curve of SN 1997ef appears to follow the decay rate of\nCo. If we assume that the deposition of the \u03b3-rays and positrons is complete (D\u03b3 = 1)\nin this late phase, a 56 Ni mass of 0.10 M\u2299 is derived. However, this must be an underestimate, because 0.13 M\u2299 of 56 Ni was required to explain the peak of the light curve, and\nthe subsequent decline was faster than the 56 Co slope, so that D\u03b3 , integrated over the entire\nejecta, must be less than 1 in the late phase. In the combined photospheric and nebular\nmodels for SN 1997ef, we find D\u03b3 \u2248 0.35 in the nebula. If we take this value of D\u03b3 to be\nrepresentative of the entire SN, we require M(56 Ni)= 0.29 M\u2299 to fit the luminosity, which\nis certainly an overestimate, because there is still a photosphere in the March 1998 spectra.\nThis suggests that M(56 Ni) may be about 0.2 M\u2299 , part of which is buried deep in the ejecta\nso that D\u03b3 \u2248 1, and the rest is in the nebula where D\u03b3 would change with radius or position\nin a more continuous manner.\n56\n\nThe presence of 56 Ni deep in the ejecta, which contributes only marginally to the peak\nof the light curve, may be in agreement with the observed presence of material at velocities\nbelow the cutoff required for the ejection of 0.13 M\u2299 of 56 Ni. However, this puzzling finding\nalso suggests that the explosion may not be described accurately if simple spherical symmetry\nis adopted.\nThe combination of the photospheric and nebular components in the advanced-phase\nspectra of SN 1997ef seems to require a value of the 56 Ni mass of at least 0.15 M\u2299 , slightly\nlarger than the estimate from the peak of the light curve. This value is subject to uncertainties because of the incomplete \u03b3-ray deposition. A more accurate determination of the 56 Ni\nmass may be possible by analyzing data from later epochs, when the SN should more closely\napproximate a nebula. Unfortunately, the only spectrum of SN 1997ef which is sufficiently\nlate is also very noisy, and only the [O i] and Ca ii lines can be detected. However, Matheson\net al. (2001) suggested that another SN Ic, SN 1997dq, is a close analogue of SN 1997ef, and\nthere exist nebular spectra of this SN.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n4.\n\nSN 1997dq: A SN 1997ef-Like Supernova\n\nMatheson et al. (2001) showed a set of spectra of the peculiar SN Ic 1997dq and suggested\nthat it is similar to SN 1997ef (cf. their Figures 17 and 18). In Figure 4 we compare the\nnormalized light curves of these two SNe. The light curve of SN 1997dq (Nakano & Aoki\n1997; Moretti & Tomaselli 1997, 1998a,b,c) is shifted by 1.8 mag and the epoch is defined so\nthat the two light curves overlap. These light curves seem to be very similar, suggesting that\nthe properties of SN 1997dq were either the same as those of SN 1997ef or fell along the track\nof parameters (Mej , Ekin ) which produce equivalent light curves. However, having assigned\nan epoch to the spectra of SN 1997dq on the basis of the light-curve comparison, its spectra\ncan now be compared with those of SN 1997ef taken at a nominally similar epoch. This\ncomparison (Figure 5) shows that the two SNe also have very similar spectra. Because the\nspectra (line width and velocity) also depend on Mej and Ekin , but do so in a different way\nthan does the light-curve shape, the fact that both the light curves and the spectra of the\ntwo SNe are similar shows rather conclusively that they had comparable parameters. The\nonly slight uncertainty may be in the mass of 56 Ni, because this affects the overall brightness\nof the light curve, but not so much its shape. An independent determination of the mass of\n56\nNi can, however, be obtained from the nebular spectrum.\nAs we mentioned above, a nebular spectrum is available of SN 1997dq. This can be\nused to determine the mass of 56 Ni ejected by this SN and, by analogy, by SN 1997ef. The\nspectrum was obtained on 1998 June 18 (Matheson et al. 2001). Given the dating of the\nSN 1997dq light curve based on the comparison with the light curve of SN 1997ef, the epoch\nof this spectrum is 262 days after explosion. A small error in the determination of the epoch\ndoes not affect the results of the modelling.\nWe modelled the 1998 June 18 spectrum with our NLTE nebular code (e.g., Mazzali\net al. 2001). Given the relative distance modulus of SN 1997dq with respect to SN 1997ef\n(\u22121.8 mag), we adopted for SN 1997dq a distance modulus \u03bc = 31.83 mag (d \u2248 23 Mpc).\nWe assumed that no reddening is present, as for SN 1997ef.\nThe best fit (Figure 6) required M(56 Ni) = 0.16 M\u2299 , and a total mass of 2.3 M\u2299 , of\nwhich only about 0.8 M\u2299 consists of O, the rest being mostly Si, C, and S. The masses\nof Ca and Mg are rather small by comparison, even though they do give rise to rather\nstrong emission features. The nebula has an outer velocity of only \u223c 5000 km s\u22121 , which is\nsimilar to the velocity of the nebular component of the spectra of SN 1997ef. The fact that\nthe velocities of the regions that form the nebular spectrum are low confirms the finding\nof Mazzali et al. (2000) that significant amounts of mass are present at velocities lower\nthan the cutoff imposed by 1-dimensional explosion models. Indeed, Mazzali et al. (2000)\nestimated that the mass between 3000 and 5000 km s\u22121 is 1.65 M\u2299 , in good agreement\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nwith our result here, which refers to all regions with v < 5000 km s\u22121 . The density of the\nouter regions, which contributed to the early spectra, is too low at these advanced epochs to\ncontribute significantly to the nebular spectrum, and the deposition of \u03b3-rays and positrons\nis also probably quite small, because 56 Ni is not expected to be mostly located in those outer\nregions. The estimate of the 56 Ni mass is also in good agreement with the results obtained for\nSN 1997ef. Although the spectrum is not of exceptionally good signal-to-noise ratio, the line\nprofiles seem to show no signs of an asymmetric explosion, such as the double components,\nnarrow and broad, observed in the nebular spectra of SN 1998bw (Mazzali et al. 2001).\nThe only available photometry of SN 1997dq are the unfiltered CCD points reported\nin several IAUCs. Since we do not know the exact response of the CCDs that were used to\nobserve SN 1997dq, the V -band fluxes derived from the unfiltered CCD fluxes to compare\nSN 1997dq to SN 1997ef have an intrinsic uncertainty. CCD's typically have a response\nsimilar to that of the R-band (see, e.g., Sec. 2 and Fig. 27 in Matheson et al. 2001). The\nspectra of SN 1997dq show that its R and V magnitudes have a difference of \u223c 0.5 mag. We\ntake this as an estimate of the uncertainty of approximating the V flux to the CCD flux. To\naccount for this uncertainty, we also modelled the nebular spectrum using distance moduli\nof 32.33 and 31.33 mag. We can still obtain good fits of the nebular spectrum using the\nsame outer velocity for the nebula, but the 56 Ni mass and the total ejecta mass increase to\n0.195 M\u2299 and 2.7 M\u2299 , respectively, if the larger distance is used, and decrease to 0.135 M\u2299\nand 2.0 M\u2299 , respectively, if the shorter distance is used. This range of values (in particular\nthe mass of 56 Ni) is consistent with the SN having produced more 56 Ni than the average\nSN Ic.\nThe main discrepancies between the synthetic and observed spectra are the emission\nnear 7750\u00c5, which is absent in the model, and the [Ca ii] 7291,7324 \u00c5, which is too broad in\nthe model. As for the first feature, it is tempting to attribute it to O i 7775 \u00c5. However, this\nline is very weak in our models, as it comes from rather highly excited upper levels. Signs of a\nnarrow Ca ii IR triplet are also seen, and this could indicate an inhomogeneous distribution\nof Ca. However, the 7291,7324 \u00c5 line is also affected by [Fe ii] emission (\u03bb\u03bb7155,7388),\nwhich contributes to making the synthetic feature too broad. A three-dimensional study,\nor at least a one-dimensional stratified one, may be required to understand this behaviour.\nBoth problems, however, may simply be due to our still rather limited knowledge of Fe-group\nlines collision strengths.\nIn conclusion, our simulations of the nebular spectrum of SN 1997dq confirm that this\nSN had very similar properties to SN 1997ef, and in particular that it ejected \u223c 0.16\u00b10.03 M\u2299\nof 56 Ni. The final points in the light curve of SN 1997ef are indeed brighter than the synthetic\nlight curves, which were computed for 0.13 M\u2299 (Mazzali et al. 2000).\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n5.\n\nDiscussion\n\nUsing the advanced-phase spectra of SN 1997ef and one nebular spectrum of SN 1997dq\nwe have shown that the two SNe are very similar, so that SN 1997dq can also be dubbed a\nhypernova. We also found that the mass of 56 Ni ejected by both SNe is \u223c 0.16 M\u2299 , somewhat\nlarger than the 0.13 M\u2299 necessary to fit the early light curve.\nThe fact that SN 1997ef retained a photospheric component to its spectrum up to at\nleast day 126 suggests that even though the outer ejecta were expanding at high velocities,\na significant fraction of the mass was ejected at very low velocities. This contradicts the\nresults of 1-dimensional explosion calculations (Mazzali et al. 2000), which produce ejecta\nwith a well-defined lower velocity boundary, but is consistent with the finding by Mazzali\net al. (2000) from modelling the early-time spectra that only \u223c 0.04 M\u2299 of 56 Ni is located\nat v > 4000 km s\u22121 .\nMaeda et al. (2003) computed a light curve with our Monte Carlo model based on the\nabove prescriptions. They find that the increased 56 Ni mass helps to reproduce the late-time\nlight curve, but it does not affect the early-time light curve if it is contained in an inner\nregion of low velocity and high density which is added to the original density structure. This\ninner region is also necessary to have the prolonged photospheric-type spectra.\nA possibility is that SN 1997ef, like other SN 1998bw-like SNe Ic, was a highly aspherical\nexplosion. Two-dimensional calculations of jetted explosions show that the asphericity significantly alters the density and Ni distributions, especially in the central region (Maeda et al.\n2002; Maeda & Nomoto 2003). Signatures of asphericity, however, are not easy to detect,\npartly due to the paucity of detailed and direct theoretical predictions by multi-dimensional\nradiation calculations. If SN 1997ef was a highly aspherical explosion, it is likely that the\nSN was not viewed from very close to the jet axis, since the case for association with a GRB\nis not strong.\nIt is interesting that at least 2 objects out of the 28 SNe Ib/Ic discussed by Matheson\net al. (2001) are SN 1998bw-like SNe Ic. SNe Ib/c are thought to originate from the stripped\nCO cores of massive stars (e.g., SN 1994I had a core mass MCO \u2248 2 M\u2299 and a main-sequence\nmass of \u223c 15 M\u2299 ; Iwamoto et al. 1994). For SN 1997ef, the ZAMS mass was estimated to\nbe \u223c 30\u201335M\u2299 . The least massive SN 1998bw-like SN Ic known to date is SN 2002ap, for\nwhich the ZAMS mass was estimated at \u223c 20\u201325 M\u2299 . For a normal initial mass function,\n\u223c 20% of all stars with Mms > 8 M\u2299 have M > 25 M\u2299 . Podsiadlowski et al. (2004) have\nrecently suggested that not all massive, stripped-envelope stars become SN 1998bw-like SNe\n(although all long-duration GRBs may be SN 1998bw-like SNe).\nThere may be other objects in the Matheson et al. (2001) sample which are SN 1998bw-\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nlike SNe Ic. In particular, judging from the nebular velocities at epochs of >\n\u223c 100 days, Table\n5 of Matheson et al. (2001) suggests that SNe 1995F and 1990B may have had energies larger\nthan the lower-energy SN Ic 1994I. It would be interesting to study the properties of a sample\nof SNe Ib/Ic to determine their kinetic energies and the amount of 56 Ni they synthesized, in\norder to verify whether they might populate the plots relating these quantities to the ZAMS\nmass (Nomoto et al. 2003).\nA.V.F.'s research is supported by National Science Foundation grant AST-0307894.\nK.N.'s work has been supported in part by the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (14047206,\n14540223, 15204010) of the Ministry of Education, Science, Culture, Sports, and Technology\nin Japan.\n\nREFERENCES\nBranch, D. 2001, in Supernovae and Gamma-Ray Bursts, ed.
