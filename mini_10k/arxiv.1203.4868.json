Introduction\nThe calculation of the multiloop integrals is important for the applications of the perturbative\nquantum field theory. A number of the calculational methods has been developed for this\npurpose. They roughly fall in to two categories: direct and indirect methods. The former\ninclude Feynman parameterization technique, Mellin-Barnes representation method, Gegenbauer\npolynomials expansion in coordinate space. The latter methods make use of the equations which\nare satisfied by the integrals. The construction of these equations relies on the possibility to\nmake the IBP reduction of the integrals under consideration to some finite set of the integrals,\ncalled \"master integrals\". Using this technique one can derive the differential equation for\nthe integrals with several scales, or difference equation for the integrals with one scale. These\nequations determine the integrals up to the solution of their homogeneous parts.\nIn Ref. [1] a method of multiloop integrals evaluation based on D recurrence relations [2]\nand D-analyticity was suggested (DRA method). Since then it was applied to the calculation of\nvarious complicated integrals [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. In this contribution we review this method.\n2. DRA method\n2.1. Dimensional recurrence relation\nAssume that we are interested in the calculation of the L-loop integral depending on E linearly\nindependent external momenta p1 , . . . , pE . There are N = L(L + 1)/2 + LE scalar products\ndepending on the loop momenta li :\nsij = sji = li * qj ;\n\ni = 1, . . . , L;\n\nj = 1, . . . , K,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere q1,...,L = l1,...,L , qL+1,...,K = p1,...,E , and K = L + E.\nThe loop integral has the form\nJ\n\n(D)\n\n(n1 , . . . , nN ) =\n\nZ\n\ndD lL . . . dD l1\nnN\n\u03c0 LD/2 D1n1 D2n2 . . . DN\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the scalar functions D\u03b1 are linear polynomials with respect to sij . The functions D\u03b1 are\nassumed to be linearly independent and to form a complete basis in the sense that any non-zero\n\n\flinear combination of them depends on the loop momenta, and any sij can be expressed in terms\nof D\u03b1 .\nThe integral J (D) (n1 , . . . , nN ) = J (D) (n) can be considered as a value of function of integer\nN -dimensional vector n = (n1 , . . . , nN ). The set of points in ZN (and the corresponding set\nof integrals), having the same set of positive coordinates, form a sector. Thus the whole space\nis split into 2N different sectors which can be conveniently labeled by their simplest elements.\nE.g., (1, 1, 0, 0, . . . , 0) denotes the sector in which all points have exactly two first coordinates\npositive. The points (and the corresponding integrals) in ZN and the sectors form a partially\nordered set with respect to the following relation. We say that the point n is simpler than the\npoint m iff all coordinates, positive in n, are also positive in m, but not vice versa.\nIt is convenient [1] to introduce the operators Ai , Bi which act on such functions as\n(Ai f )(. . . , ni , . . .) = ni f (. . . , ni + 1, . . .) ,\n(Bi f )(. . . , ni , . . .) = f (. . . , ni \u2212 1, . . .) .\n\n(3)\n\nThese operators respect the notion of sectors in a sense that the values of functions Ai f and\nBi f in the point of some sector are expressed via the values of function f in the same or simpler\nsectors. Using these operators, we can express the integral in D \u00b1 2 dimensions via the integrals\nin D dimensions [9]:\nJ (D+2) (n) =\n\nh\ni\u22121\n(2\u03bc)L det {pi * pj }i,j=1...E\n(D \u2212 E \u2212 L + 1)L\n\nP (B1 , . . . , BN ) J (D) (n) ,\n\nJ (D\u22122) (n) = (\u03bc/2)L Q (A1 , . . . , AN ) J (D) (n) ,\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03bc = \u00b11 for the Euclidean/pseudoEuclidean case, and polynomials P and Q are determined\nas\n\nQ\n\n\u0012\n\nP (D1 , . . . , DN ) = det {qi * qj }i,j=1...K ,\n\u0013\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u03b4ij \u2202\n.\n,...,\n= det 2\n\u2202D1\n\u2202DN\n\u2202sij i,j=1...L\n\n(6)\n\nThese relations are the most useful when the integral in the left-hand side is master. Then,\nmaking the IBP reduction of the right-hand side of Eqs. (4),(5), one obtains difference equations\nfor the master integrals. After this, we obtain a linear combination of the integrals of the same,\nor simpler, sectors as the integral in the left-hand side of Eqs. (4),(5). We assume that the\nintegrals of the the simpler sectors are already known at this stage, either by the same, or by\nsome other method.\nThe IBP reduction makes Eqs. (4),(5) equivalent, so in what follows we consider only the\nlowering dimensional recurrence relation, obtained from Eq. (4). We also change notations,\nwriting\nJ (D) = J(\u03bd),\n(7)\nwhere \u03bd = D/2. If a sector of the integral in the left-hand side contains only one master integral,\nthe general form of the equation is the following:\nJ(\u03bd + 1) = C(\u03bd)J(\u03bd) + R(\u03bd),\n\n(8)\n\nwhere C(\u03bd) is some rational function of \u03bd and R(\u03bd) is a non-homogeneous part constructed of\nthe simpler master integrals in D = 2\u03bd dimensions. If a sector contains several master integrals,\n\n\fit is convenient to consider them as a column-vector integral J(\u03bd) and to write the equations\nfor them in a matrix form:\nJ(\u03bd + 1) = C(\u03bd)J(\u03bd) + R(\u03bd),\n(9)\nwhere C(\u03bd) is some rational matrix (i.e., the matrix with coefficients being rational functions of\n\u03bd).\n2.2. General solution\nIn order to write the general solution of this equation, we introduce the notion of indefinite sum\nand indefinite product. Given the function F (\u03bd), the indefinite sum \u03a3 F (\u03bd) is any function,\nsatisfying the relation\n(10)\n\u03a3 F (\u03bd + 1) \u2212 \u03a3 F (\u03bd) = F (\u03bd)\nThe indefinite sum \u03a3 F (\u03bd) is defined up to the addition of arbitrary periodic function of \u03bd. If\nthe function F (\u03bd) decreases faster than 1/\u03bd when \u03bd \u2192 +\u221e and/or \u03bd \u2192 \u2212\u221e, one can write\ndef\n\n\u03a3 F (\u03bd) = \u03a3 F (\u03bd) + \u03c9(z) = \u2212\n+\u221e\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\nF (\u03bd + n) + \u03c9(z)\n\n(11)\n\nF (\u03bd + n) + \u03c9(z),\n\n(12)\n\nn=0\n\nand/or\ndef\n\n\u03a3 F (\u03bd) = \u03a3 F (\u03bd) + \u03c9(z) =\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u22121\nX\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere \u03c9(z) = \u03c9(exp(2\u03c0i\u03bd)) is arbitrary periodic function.\nThe indefinite product \u03a0F (\u03bd) is any function, satisfying the relation\n\u03a0F (\u03bd + 1)/\u03a0F (\u03bd) = F (\u03bd)\n\n(13)\n\n\u03a0F (\u03bd) is defined up to the multiplication by arbitrary periodic function of \u03bd. Note that for\nany rational function F (\u03bd) one can express \u03a0F (\u03bd) as a product of \u0393-functions multiplied by\narbitrary periodic function, see Ref. [1]. We will determine the indefinite product \u03a0F(\u03bd) also\nfor the matrix functions F(\u03bd) as a matrix function, satisfying the relation\n\u03a0F(\u03bd + 1)(\u03a0F(\u03bd))\u22121 = F(\u03bd)\n\n(14)\n\nObviously, this defines \u03a0F(\u03bd) up to the multiplication from the right by arbitrary periodic\nmatrix.\nIn these notations one can write down the general solution of Eq. (9) in the form\nJ(\u03bd) = S(\u03bd)\u22121 \u03a3 S(\u03bd)R(\u03bd),\n\n(15)\n\nwhere S(\u03bd) = [\u03a0C(\u03bd)]\u22121 is called a summing factor. If the summand in Eq.(16) decreases faster\nthan 1/\u03bd when \u03bd \u2192 +\u221e and/or \u03bd \u2192 \u2212\u221e, one can use Eqs. (11),(12) to write\nJ(\u03bd) = S(\u03bd)\u22121 \u03c9(z) + S(\u03bd)\u22121 \u03a3 S(\u03bd)R(\u03bd) .\n\u00b1\u221e\n\n(16)\n\nNote that the second term in the right-hand side is invariant with respect to the choice of the\nsumming factor. Thus, in order to find the integral, we need to fix the function \u03c9(z) for any\nchoice of the summing factor. Here we note the essential difference between the general solutions\nof differential and difference equations. The homogeneous part of the general solution of the\ndifferential equation is parameterized by finite number of constants, while the homogeneous part\nof the general solution of the difference equation is parameterized by the periodic function(s).\n\n\f\u03bd\nz\n\n2\u03c0\u03bd0\n\u03bd0\n\n\u03bd0 + 1\n\nFigure 1. Mapping \u03bd \u2192 z\nWhile fixing the finite number of constants is a relatively simple task, fixing the periodic function\nmay be quite difficult. The key point of the DRA approach is the usage of the analytical\nproperties of the integral in order to fix this function. Let us rewrite Eq.(16) as\n\u03c9(z) = S(\u03bd)J(\u03bd) \u2212 \u03a3 S(\u03bd)R(\u03bd) .\n\u00b1\u221e\n\n(17)\n\nSuppose that we can show that the right-hand side of this equation is a meromorphic function\nof z in the Riemann sphere. Then \u03c9(z) is determined, up to a constant, by the principal parts\nof its Laurent series around singular points. The analysis of the analytical properties of the\nright-hand side of Eq. (17) can be performed in any vertical stripe of unit length in the complex\nplane of \u03bd, as demonstrated in Fig. 1. There is no cut on the ray arg(z) = 2\u03c0\u03bd0 because the\nright-hand side is necessarily a periodic function of \u03bd. The proper choice of this stripe (basic\nstripe) can simplify the evaluation of the integral.\n2.3. Analytical properties of integrals\nUsually, one is interested in the analytical properties of the integral as a function of some external\ninvariant. Here we are interested instead in the analytical properties of the integral as a function\nof \u03bd = D/2. It appears that the latter properties are much simpler than the former.\nLet us consider the parametric representation of some L-loop integral in Euclidean space with\nI internal lines (see, e.g., Ref. [10]):\nZ\nP\n[q (x)]\u03bdL\u2212I\n.\n(18)\nJ (\u03bd) = \u0393 (I \u2212 L\u03bd) dx1 . . . dxI \u03b4 (1 \u2212 xi )\n[p (x)]\u03bd(L+1)\u2212I\nThe polynomials q (x) and p (x) are determined by the graph. For our consideration it is\nimportant only that both these functions are nonnegative in the whole integration region,\nq (x) > 0,\n\np (x) > 0.\n\nSuppose that the parametric representation converges for all \u03bd in some interval (\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 ). Then\nit is easy to see that it converges on the whole stripe S = {\u03bd, Re \u03bd \u2208 (\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 )}. Indeed, we can\nestimate\n|\u0393 (I \u2212 L\u03bd)|\nJ (Re \u03bd) .\n(19)\n|J (\u03bd)| 6\n\u0393 (I \u2212 L Re \u03bd)\n\nTherefore, Eq. (18) determines J (\u03bd) as a holomorphic function on the whole stripe S. In fact,\nin Ref. [11] a more general fact was proved: the representation (18) determines the meromorphic\n\n\fT3,1 (c.l = 0)\n\nT4,1 (c.l. = 1)\n\nT4,2 (c.l. = 1)\n\nT5,1 (c.l. = 2)\n\nT6,1 (c.l. = 3)\n\nFigure 2. Three-loop all-massive tadpole master ntegrals.\nfunction on the whole complex \u03bd-plane. The determination of poles position can be automatized\nthanks to FIESTA [12].\nAs Im \u03bd tends to \u00b1\u221e while Re \u03bd is fixed, Eq. (19) shows that\n|J (\u03bd)| . const \u00d7 e\u2212\n\n\u03c0L|Im \u03bd|\n2\n\n|Im \u03bd|I\u22121/2\u2212L Re \u03bd < const \u00d7 |z|\u2213(L+0)/4 .\n\n(20)\n\nThus, the parametric representation can be used for the determination of the analytical\nproperties of the first term in the right-hand side of Eq. (17). Since the second term in the\nright-hand side of Eq.

Numerical issues\nIn order to demonstrate how the representations obtained within the DRA method can be\ntreated numerically, let us consider the three-loop master integrals depicted in Fig. 2. Direct\napplication of the DRA method gives the following results:\nT3,1 = \u0393(1 \u2212 \u03bd)3\n\u001a\n\u001b\n4\u03c0\n1\n3\u2212\u03bd\n\u221a \u2212 \u03a3 S4,1 T3,1 , S4,1 =\nT4,1 =\nS4,1 3 3 \u2212\u221e\n\u0393(2 \u2212 2\u03bd)\u0393(1 \u2212 \u03bd)\n\u001a 2\n\u001b\n(11\u03bd \u2212 8)S4,2 T3,1\n3\u03c0\n1\n41\u22123\u03bd \u0393(2 \u2212 \u03bd)2\n\u2212 \u03a3\nT4,2 =\n, S4,2 =\nS4,2 16\n8(\u03bd \u2212 1)\n\u0393(3 \u2212 3\u03bd)\u0393(3 \u2212 2\u03bd)\n\u2212\u221e\n\u001a\n\u001b\n2\n16\u03c0\n4(7\u03bd \u2212 4)T3,1 \u2212 36(3\u03bd \u2212 2)T4,1 \u2212 (2 + 13\u03bd)T4,2\n1\n+ \u03a3 S5,1\n,\nT5,1 =\nS5,1\n27\n27(3\u03bd \u2212 2)\n\u2212\u221e\n9\u2212\u03bd \u0393(1 \u2212 \u03bd)\nS5,1 (\u03bd) =\n\u0393(2 \u2212 2\u03bd)2\n\u001b\n\u001a\nS6,1\n2\u2212\u03bd\n1\n(T4,2 \u2212 3T5,1 ) , S6,1 =\n2\u03c0 2 + \u03a3\nT6,1 =\nS6,1\n\u0393(2 \u2212 2\u03bd)\u0393(2 \u2212 \u03bd)\n\u2212\u221e 2\n\n(21)\n(22)\n(23)\n\n(24)\n(25)\n\nThe above results for the integrals T5,1 and T6,1 contain repeated sums of the form:\ns=\n\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\nX\n\nn1 =0 n2 =n1\n\n...\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nf1 (n1 )f2 (n2 ) . . . fk (nk )\n\n(26)\n\nnk =nk\u22121\n\nFrom the viewpoint of numerical calculation, it is important that the dependence on the\nsummation variables is factorized in the summand.

Let us show that the calculation of such factorized sums can be\nperformed without nested loops. Indeed, let us define k sequences s1 (n), . . . , sk (n) as follows:\nsi (\u22121) = 0 ,\n\ns1 (n > 0) = s1 (n \u2212 1) + f1 (n \u2212 1) ,\n\nsi>1 (n > 0) = si (n \u2212 1) + fi (n)si\u22121 (n)\n(27)\n\nIt is easy to check that the last sequence, sk (n), converges to s. Obviously, the iterative\ncalculation of these quantities can be organized in one loop. Therefore, the complexity of\nthe numerical calculation grows moderately with the complexity level of the integrals. The\ndependence of the calculation time on the order of the expansion, required precision, and\ncomplexity level of the integrals is shown in Fig. 3. We see that for all three cases the method\nshows quite moderate growth of the evaluation time.\n3. Conclusion\nWe have briefly reviewed the method of calculation of multiloop integrals based on the Drecurrence and D-analyticity. The method appears to be powerful enough to deal with the most\ncomplicated cases.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by RFBR (grants Nos. 10-02-01238, 11-02-01196, 11-02-00220, 11-0208379) and by Federal special-purpose program \"Scientific and scientific-pedagogical personnel\nof innovative Russia\".
