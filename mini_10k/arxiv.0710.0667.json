Introduction\nThe period doubling renormalization operator was introduced by M. Feigenbaum [Fe], [Fe2]\nand by P. Coullet and C. Tresser [CT], [TC] to study the asymptotic small scale geometry of\nthe attractor of one-dimensional systems which are at the transition from simple to chaotic\ndynamics. In 1978, they published certain rigidity properties of such systems, the small\nscale geometry of the invariant Cantor set of generic smooth maps at the boundary of chaos\nbeing independent of the particular map being considered. Coullet and Tresser treated\nthis phenomenon as similar to universality that has been observed in critical phenomena\nfor long and explained since the early seventieth by Kenneth Wilson (see, e.g., [Ma]). In\nan attempt to explain universality at the transition to chaos, both groups formulated the\nfollowing conjectures that are similar to what was conjectured in statistical mechanics.\nRenormalization conjectures: In the proper class of maps, the period doubling renormalization operator has a unique fixed point that is hyperbolic with a one-dimensional unstable\nmanifold and a codimension one stable manifold consisting of the systems at the transition\nto chaos.\nThese conjectures were extended to other types of dynamics on the interval and on other\nmanifolds but we will not be concerned here with such generalizations. During the last 30\nyears many authors have contributed to the development of a rigorous theory proving the\nrenormalization conjectures and explaining the phenomenology. The ultimate goal may still\nbe far since the universality class of smooth maps at the boundary of chaos contains many\nsorts of dynamical systems, including useful differential models of natural phenomena and\nthere even are predictions about natural phenomena in [CT], which turned out to be experimentally corroborated. A historical review of the mathematics that have been developed\ncan be found in [FMP] so that we recall here only a few milestones that will serve to better\nunderstand the contribution to the overall picture brought by the present paper.\nThe type of differentiability of the systems under consideration has a crucial influence on\nthe actual small scale geometrical behavior (like it is the case in the related problem of smooth\nconjugacy of circle diffeomorphisms to rotations: compare [He] to [KO] and [KS]). The first\nresult dealt with holomorphic systems and were first local [La], and later global [Su], [McM],\n[Ly] (a progression similar to what had been seen in the problem of smooth conjugacy to\nrotations: compare [Ar] to [He] and [Yo]). With global methods came also means to consider\nother renormalizations. Indeed, the hyperbolicity of the unique renormalization fixed point\nhas been shown in [La] for period doubling, and later in [Ly] by means that generalize to\nother sorts of dynamics. Then it was showed in [Da] that the renormalization fixed point\nis also hyperbolic in the space of C 2+\u03b1 unimodal maps with \u03b1 close to one (using [La]),\nthese results being later extended in [FMP] to more general types of renormalization (using\n[Ly]). As far as existence of fixed points is concerned, a satisfactory theory could be obtained\nsome time ago, first for period doubling only and then for maps with bounded combinatorics\nafter several subclasses of dynamics had been solved, see [M] for the most general results,\nassuming the lowest degree of smoothness and references to the prior literature.\nWe are interested in exploring from below the limit of smoothness that permits hyperbolicity of the fixed point of renormalization. Our main result concern a new smoothness\nclass, C 2+|*| , which is bigger than C 2+\u03b1 for any positive \u03b1 \u2264 1, and is in fact wider than C 2\nin ways that are rather technical as we shall describe later (this is the bigger class where\n2\n\n\fthe usual method to get a priori bounds for the geometry of the Cantor set work). We\nare interested here in the part of hyperbolicity that consists in the attraction in the stable\nmanifold made of infinitely renomalizable maps. We show that in the space of C 2+|*| unimodal maps the analytic fixed point is not hyperbolic for the action of the period doubling\nrenormalization operator. We also show that nevertheless, the renormalization converges to\nthe analytic generic fixed point (here generic means that the second derivative at the critical\npoint is not zero), proving it to be globally unique, a uniqueness that was formerly known in\nclasses smaller than C 2+|*| (hence assuming more smoothness). The convergence might only\nbe polynomial as a concrete sign of non-hyperbolicity. The failure of hyperbolicity happens\nin a more serious way in the space of C 2 unimodal maps since there the convergence can be\narbitrarily slow. The uniqueness of the fixed point in this case, remains an open question.\nThe uniqueness was known to be wrong in a serious way among C 1+Lip unimodal maps since\na continuum of fixed points of renormalization could be produced [Tr]. Here we show that\nthe period doubling renormalization operator acting on the space of C 1+Lip unimodal maps\nhas infinite topological entropy.\nAfter this informal discussion of what will be done here and how it relates to universality\ntheory, we now give some definitions, which allows us next to turn to the precise formulation\nof our main results.\nA unimodal map f : [0, 1] \u2192 [0, 1] is a C 1 mapping with the following properties.\n\u2022 f (1) = 0,\n\u2022 there is a unique point c \u2208 (0, 1), the critical point, where Df (c) = 0,\n\u2022 f (c) = 1.\nA map is a C r unimodal maps if f is C r . We will concentrate on unimodal maps of the type\nC 1+Lip , C 2 , and C 2+|*| . This last type of differentiability will be introduced in \u00a7 5.\nThe critical point c of a C 2 unimodal map f is called non-flat if D 2 f (c) 6= 0. A critical\npoint c of a unimodal map f is a quadratic tip if there exists a sequence of points xn \u2192 c\nand constant A > 0 such that\nf (xn ) \u2212 f (c)\n= \u2212A.\nn\u2192\u221e\n(xn \u2212 c)2\nlim\n\nThe set of C r unimodal maps with a quadratic tip is denoted by U r . We will consider\ndifferent metrics on this set denoted by distk with k = 0, 1, 2 (in fact the usual C k metrics).\nA unimodal map f : [0, 1] \u2192 [0, 1] with quadratic tip c is renormalizable if\n\u2022 c \u2208 [f 2 (c), f 4(c)] \u2261 I01 ,\n\u2022 f (I01 ) = [f 3 (c), f (c)] \u2261 I11 ,\n\u2022 I01 \u2229 I11 = \u2205.\nThe set of renormalizable C r unimodal maps is denoted by U0r \u2282 U r . Let f \u2208 U0r be a\nrenormalizable map. The renormalization of f is defined by\nRf (x) = h\u22121 \u25e6 f 2 \u25e6 h(x),\nwhere h : [0, 1] \u2192 I01 is the orientation reversing affine homeomorphism. This map Rf is\nagain a unimodal map. The nonlinear operator R : U0r \u2192 U r defined by\nR : f 7\u2192 Rf\n3\n\n\fis called the renormalization operator. The set of infinitely renormalizable maps is denoted\nby\n\\\nWr =\nR\u2212n (U0r ).\nn\u22651\n\nThere are many fundamental steps needed to reach the following result by Davie, see [Da].\nFor a brief history see [FMP] and references therein.\nTheorem 1.1. (Davie) Let \u03b1 < 1 close enough to one. There exists a unique renormalization\nfixed point f\u2217\u03c9 \u2208 U 2+\u03b1 . It has the following properties.\n\u2022 f\u2217\u03c9 is analytic,\n\u2022 f\u2217\u03c9 is a hyperbolic fixed point of R : U02+\u03b1 \u2192 U 2+\u03b1 ,\n\u2022 the codimension one stable manifold of f\u2217\u03c9 coincides with W 2+\u03b1 .\n\u2022 f\u2217\u03c9 has a one dimensional unstable manifold which consists of analytic maps.\nIn our discussion we only deal with period doubling renormalization. However, there are\nother renormalization schemes. The hyperbolicity for the corresponding generalized renormalization operator has been established in [FMP].\nOur main results deal with R : U0r \u2192 U r where r \u2208 {1 + Lip, 2, 2 + | * |}.\nTheorem 1.2. Let dn > 0 be any sequence with dn \u2192 0. There exists an infinitely renormalizable C 2 unimodal map f with quadratic tip such that\ndist0 (Rn f, f\u2217\u03c9 ) \u2265 dn .\nCorollary 1.3. The analytic unimodal map f\u2217\u03c9 is not a hyperbolic fixed point of R : U02 \u2192 U 2 .\nIn \u00a7 5 we will introduce a type of differentiability of a unimodal map, called C 2+|*| , which\nis the minimal needed to be able to apply the classical proofs of a priori bounds for the\ninvariant Cantor sets of infinitely renormalizable maps, see for example [M2],[MMSS],[MS].\nThis type of differentiability will allow us to represent any C 2+|*| unimodal map as\nf = \u03c6 \u25e6 q,\nwhere q is a quadratic polynomial and \u03c6 has still enough differentiability to control crossratio distortion. The precise description of this decomposition is given in Proposition 5.6.\nFor completeness we include the proof of the a priori bounds in \u00a7 7.\nTheorem 1.4. If f is an infinitely renormalizable C 2+|*| unimodal map then\nlim dist0 (Rn f, f\u2217\u03c9 ) = 0.\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nA construction similar to the one provided for C 2 unimodal maps leads to the following\nresult:\nP\nTheorem 1.5. Let dn > 0 be any sequence with n\u22651 dn < \u221e. There exists an infinitely\nrenormalizable C 2+|*| unimodal map f with a quadratic tip such that\ndist0 (Rn f, f\u2217\u03c9 ) \u2265 dn .\n2+|*|\n\nThe analytic unimodal map f\u2217\u03c9 is not a hyperbolic fixed point of R : U0\n4\n\n\u2192 U 2+|*| .\n\n\fOur second set of theorems deals with renormalization of C 1+Lip unimodal maps with a\nquadratic tip.\nTheorem 1.6. There exists an infinitely renormalizable C 1+Lip unimodal map f with a\nquadratic tip which is not C 2 but\nRf = f.\nThe topological entropy of a system defined on a noncompact space is defined to be the\nsupremum of the topological entropies contained in compact invariant subsets: we will always\nmean topological entropy when the type of entropy is not specified. As a consequence of\nTheorem 1.1 we get that renormalization on U02+\u03b1 has entropy zero.\nTheorem 1.7. The renormalization operator acting on the space of C 1+Lip unimodal maps\nwith quadratic tip has infinite entropy.\nThe last theorem illustrates a specific aspect of the chaotic behavior of the renormalization\noperator on U01+Lip :\nTheorem 1.8. There exists an infinitely renormalizable C 1+Lip unimodal map f with quadratic tip such that {cn }n\u22650 is dense in a Cantor set. Here cn is the critical point of Rn f .\nAcknowledgement W.de Melo was partially supported by CNPq-304912/2003-4 and FAPERJ\nE-26/152.189/2002.\n2. Notation\nLet I, J \u2282 Rn , with n \u2265 1.

C 1+Lip extension. In this sub-section we will extend the piece-wise affine map f\u2217 to a\nC 1+Lip unimodal map.

Then the idea of how to construct an extension g of f\u2217 is contained in\nthe following lemma:\nLemma 3.7. F \u2229 image(S) = S(F ).\nProof. Let \u0125 = \u0125\u03c3\u2217 ,1 and h = h\u03c3\u2217 ,1 . Let (x, y) \u2208 graph(f\u2217) \u2229 image(S). Say (x, y) =\n(S1 (x\u2032 ), S2 (y \u2032)) with S2 (y \u2032 ) = f\u2217 (S1 (x\u2032 )). Since S1 (x\u2032 ) = h(x\u2032 ) and S2 (y \u2032) = \u0125(y \u2032 ), we can\nwrite y \u2032 = \u0125\u22121 \u25e6 f\u2217 \u25e6 h(x\u2032 ). By Lemma 3.1\ny \u2032 = R1 f\u2217 (x\u2032 ) = f\u2217 (x\u2032 ),\nwhich gives (x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) \u2208 graph(f\u2217 ). This in turn implies (x, y) \u2208 S(graphf\u2217). By reading the\nprevious argument backward we prove S(graph f\u2217 ) \u2282 F \u2229 image(S).\n\u0003\nLemma 3.8. S(graph qc\u2217 ) \u2282 graph(qc\u2217 ).\nProof. Let S(graph(qc\u2217 )) be the graph of the function q. Since S is linear and qc is quadratic\nwe get that q is also a quadratic function. Then both qc\u2217 (c\u2217 ) = 1 and q(c\u2217 ) = 1, because of\nS(c\u2217 , 1) = (c\u2217 , 1). Furthermore, by construction\nS(1, 0) = (0, qc\u2217 (0)) = (0, q(0)).\nHence qc\u2217 (0) = q(0). Differentiate twice S2 (y) = q(S1 (x)) and use (\u03c30\u2217 )2 = \u03c31\u2217 from Lemma\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n3.6, which proves q (c\u2217 ) = qc\u2217 (c\u2217 ). Now we conclude that the quadratic maps q and qc\u2217 are\nequal.\n\u0003\nLet F0 be the graph of f\u2217 |I11 . Then by Lemma 3.7, F = \u222ak\u22650 S k (F0 ). Let g be a C 1+Lip\nextension of f\u2217 on D\u03c3\u2217 \u222a [x1 , 1] and G0 = graph (g|[x1, 1] ). Then G = \u222ak\u22650 S k (G0 ) is the\ngraph of an extension of f\u2217 . We prove that g is C 1+Lip and also has a quadratic tip. Let\nB k = S k ([0, 1]2 ), where\nB k = [xk\u22121 , xk ] \u00d7 [x\u0302k\u22121 , 1]\nB k = [xk , xk\u22121 ] \u00d7 [x\u0302k\u22121 , 1]\n\nfor k = 1, 3, 5, . . .\nfor k = 2, 4, . . .\n\nwhere x\u0302k\u22121 = qc (xk\u22121 ) = 1 \u2212 (\u03c31\u2217 )k .

G is the graph of a C 1 extension of f\u2217 .\nProof. Note that Gk = S k (G0 ) is the graph of a C 1 function on [xk\u22121 , xk+1 ] for k odd and on\n[xk+1 , xk\u22121 ] for k is even. To prove the Lemma we need to show continuous differentiability\nat the points bn , where these graphs intersect. By construction G0 is C 1 at b2 . Namely,\nconsider a small interval (x1 \u2212 \u03b4, x1 + \u03b4). Then on the interval (x1 \u2212 \u03b4, x1 ), the slope is given\nby an affine piece of f\u2217 and on (x1 , x1 + \u03b4) the slope is given by the chosen C 1+Lip extension.\nLet \u0393 \u2282 G be the graph over this interval (x1 \u2212 \u03b4, x1 + \u03b4). Then locally around bn the graph\nG equals S n\u22121 (\u0393). Hence G is C 1 on [0, 1] \\ {c\u2217 }. From Lemma 3.6, notice that the vertical\ncontraction of S is stronger than the horizontal contraction. This implies that the slope of\nGn tends to zero. Indeed, G is the graph of a C 1 function on [0, 1].\n\u0003\nProposition 3.11. Let g be the function whose graph is G then g is C 1+Lip with a quadratic\ntip.\nProof. Since f\u2217 |D\u03c3 has a quadratic tip, the extension g has a quadratic tip. Because g is C 1\nwe only need to show that Gn is the graph of a C 1+Lip function\ngn : [xn\u22121 , xn+1 ] \u2192 [0, 1]\nwith an uniform Lipschitz bound.

Notice that if f\u03c3 is infinitely renormalizable then every extension g is renormalizable in the classical sense.\nTheorem 3.13. There exists an infinitely renormalizable C 1+Lip unimodal map f with a\nquadratic tip which is not C 2 but\nRf = f.\n3.3. Entropy of renormalization. For all \u03c6 \u2208 C 1+Lip , \u03c6 : [x1 , 1] \u2192 [0, 1], which extends\nf\u2217 we constructed f\u03c6 \u2208 C 1+Lip in such a way that\n(i) Rf\u03c6 = f\u03c6\n(ii) f\u03c6 has a quadratic tip.\nNow choose two C 1+Lip functions which extend f\u2217 , say \u03c60 : [x1 , 1] \u2192 [0, 1] and \u03c61 : [x1 , 1] \u2192\n[0, 1]. For \u03c9 = (\u03c9k )k\u22651 \u2208 {0, 1}N , define\nFn (\u03c9) = S n (graph \u03c6\u03c9n )\nand\nF (\u03c9) = \u222ak\u22651 Fk (\u03c9).\nThen F (\u03c9) is the graph of C\nis given above. Let now\n\n1+Lip\n\nwith a quadratic tip f\u03c9 , by an argument similar to what\n\u03c4 : {0, 1}N \u2192 {0, 1}N\n\nbe the shift map defined by\n\u03c4 (\u03c9)n = \u03c9n+1 ,\n(so that the map \u03c4 acting on the set {0, 1}N is the full 2-shift).\n13\n\n\fProposition 3.14. For all \u03c9 \u2208 {0, 1}N\nf\u03c92 : [0, x1 ] \u2192 [0, x1 ]\nis a unimodal map. In particular f\u03c9 is renormalizable and\nRf\u03c9 = f\u03c4 (\u03c9) .\nProof. Note that f\u03c9 : [0, x1 ] \u2192 I11 is unimodal and onto. Furthermore, f\u03c9 : I11 \u2192 [0, x1 ] is\naffine and onto. Hence f\u03c9 is renormalizable. The construction also gives\nRf\u03c9 = f\u03c4 (\u03c9) .\n\u0003\nTheorem 3.15. Renormalization acting on the space of C 1+Lip unimodal maps has positive\nentropy.\nProof. Note that \u03c9 \u2192 f\u03c9 \u2208 C 1+Lip is injective. Hence the domain of R contains a copy of\nthe full 2-shift (i.e., contains a subset on which the restriction of R is topologically conjugate\nto the full 2-shift).\n\u0003\nRemark 3.16. We can also embedded a full k-shift in the domain of R by choosing \u03c60 , \u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6k\u22121\nand repeat the construction. The entropy of R on C 1+Lip is actually unbounded.\n4. Chaotic scaling data\nIn this section we will use a variation on the construction of scaling data as presented in\n\u00a7 3 to obtain the following\nTheorem 4.1. There exists an infinitely renormalizable C 1+Lip unimodal map g with quadratic tip such that {cn }n\u22650 , where cn is the critical point of Rn g, is dense in a Cantor\nset.\nThe proof needs some preparation. For \u01eb > 0 we will modify the construction as described\nin \u00a7 3. This modification is illustrated in Figure 8.

In particular, by choosing \u01eb0 > \u01eb1 close enough to 1 we will get the\nfollowing horseshoe as shown in Figure 9; more precisely there exists an interval A0 = [c\u22170 , a0 ]\nand A1 = [a1 , c\u22171 ] such that\nR0 : A0 \u2192 [c\u22170 , c\u22171 ] \u2283 A0\n14\n\n\fqc\n\n\u01eb qc2 (0)\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\nqc2 (0)\n\nf\u03c3\n\nc*\n\u03c31 (c, \u01eb)\n\n\u03c30 (c, \u01eb)\n\nFigure 8.\nand\nR1 : A1 \u2192 [c\u22170 , c\u22171 ] \u2283 A1\nare expanding diffeomorphisms (with derivative larger than 2, but larger than one would\nsuffice to get a horseshoe).

This is the graph of a function fn . We will extend this function (and its graph) on the gap [\u03c30 (n), 1\u2212\u03c31 (n)]. Notice, that \u03c30 (n), 1\u2212\u03c31 (n), Dfn (\u03c30 (n)), and Dfn (1\u2212\n\u03c31 (n)) vary within a compact family.

The Lipschitz constant of Dgn is bounded by K0 > 0.

For each 1 \u2264 i < j, There exists an interval T which contains Iin , such that\nf j\u2212i : T \u2192 [Iln , Irn ] is monotone and onto.\nProof. Let T \u2282 [0, 1] be the maximal interval which contains Iin such that f j\u2212i |T is monotone.\nSuch interval exists because of monotonicity of f j\u2212i |Iin . The boundary points of T are\na, b \u2208 [0, 1]. Suppose f j\u2212i (b) is to the right of Ijn . The maximality of T ensures the existence\nn\nof k, k < j \u2212 i such that f k (b) = c.

Hence f\n|I1 is monotone.\nn\nj\u2212i\nn\nSo 1 + j \u2212 i \u2212 (k + 1) \u2264 2 . This implies that f (T ) contains I1+j\u2212i\u2212(k+1) . In particular\nf j\u2212i (T ) contains Irn . Similarly we can prove f j\u2212i (T ) contains Iln .\n\u0003\nLemma 7.2. (Intersection multiplicity) Let f j\u2212i : T \u2192 [Iln , Irn ] be monotone and onto with\nT \u2283 Iin .

Without loss of generality we may restrict ourselves to estimate the intersection multiplicity at a point x \u2208 U, where\nU = [Iln , Irn ] = [ul , ur ].\nn \u2212l\n\nLet cl \u2208 Iln such that f 2\n\n(cl ) = c and\nCl = [ul , cl ] \u2282 Iln .\n\nSimilarly, define\nCr = [cr , ur ] \u2282 Irn .\nLet Tk = f k (T ),\nk = 0, 1, ....j \u2212 i.\nClaim: If i + k \u2208\n/ {l, j, r} and Tk \u2229 U 6= \u2205 then\nn\n(i) Ii+k\n\u2229U =\u2205\n(ii) U \u2229 Tk = Iln or Cl or Irn or Cr .\nLet T \\ Iin = L \u222a R and then we may assume U \u2229 Tk = U \u2229 Lk where\nn\nLk = f k (L). This holds because Ii+k\n\u2229 U = \u2205. Consider the situation where\nIrn \u2229 Lk 6= \u2205.\nThe other possibilities can be treated similarly. Notice that Irn cannot be strictly contained\nin Lk . Otherwise there would be a third \"neighbor\" of Ijn in U. Let a = \u2202L \u2229 \u2202T. Notice that\nf k (a) \u2208 \u2202Lk \u2229 Irn .\n22\n\n\fFurthermore,\nf j\u2212k (f k (a)) \u2208 \u2202U.\nThis means f j\u2212k (f k (a)) is a point in the orbit of c. This holds because all boundary points\nof the interval Ijn are in the orbit of c. Hence, f k (a) is a point in the orbit of c or f k (a) is a\npreimage of c. The first possibility implies f k (a) \u2208 \u2202Irn . This implies\nU \u2229 Tk = U \u2229 Lk = Irn .\nThe second possibility implies f k (a) = cr which means\nU \u2229 Tk = U \u2229 Lk = Cr .\nThis finishes the proof of claim. This claim gives 7 as bound for the intersection multiplicity.\n\u0003\nn \u2212j\n\nProposition 7.3. For j < 2n , f 2\n\n: Ijn \u2192 I0n has uniform bounded distortion.\n\nProof.

We claim\nthat Vn \u2282 Wn . Suppose it is not. Then, say Irnn \u2282 int(Vn ) implies that f (Irnn ) \u2282 int(L1n ).\nSo, f j0 \u22121 |f (Irnn ) is monotone, implies that rn + j0 \u2264 2n and f j0 (Irnn ) \u2282 int([Iln , Irn ]). This\ncontradiction concludes that Vn \u2282 Wn .\nStep3 : Let Ln , Rn be the components of Wn \\ Un .
