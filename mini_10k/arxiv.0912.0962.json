Conventional cooperation techniques require sharing large amounts of information over finite-capacity backhaul\nlinks and assume that base stations have full channel state information (CSI) of all the active users in\nthe system. In this paper, a new limited feedback strategy is proposed for multicell beamforming where\ncooperation is restricted to sharing only the CSI of active users among base stations. The system setup\nconsidered is a linear array of cells based on the Wyner model. Each cell contains single-antenna users\nand multi-antenna base stations. Closed-form expressions for the beamforming vectors that approximately\nmaximize the sum-rates in a multicell system are first presented, assuming full CSI at the transmitter. For\nthe more practical case of a finite-bandwidth feedback link, CSI of the desired and interfering channels\nis quantized at the receiver before being fed back to the base station. An upper bound on the mean\nloss in sum rate due to random vector quantization is derived. A new feedback-bit allocation strategy, to\npartition the available bits between the desired and interfering channels, is developed to approximately\nminimize the mean loss in sum-rate due to quantization. The proposed feedback-bit partitioning algorithm\nis shown, using simulations, to yield sum-rates close to the those obtained using full CSI at base stations.\n\n\f2\n\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nBase station cooperation is an effective strategy to increase data rates and reduce outages in multipleinput multiple-output (MIMO) cellular systems [1]\u2013[16]. Cooperative encoding at the base stations\ncan be used to combat co-channel interference (CCI), paving the way for more aggressive frequency\nreuse, which can lead to higher data rates and simpler network configurations. Consequently, cooperative\ntransmission is being considered for upcoming cellular standards like 3GPP long term evolution advanced\nthat are targeting universal frequency reuse [17]. Base station cooperation entails sharing control signals,\nuser propagation channel information and/or precoding data via high-capacity wired backhaul links to\ncoordinate transmissions [1]\u2013[16]. Most of the literature on cooperative techniques assumes that base\nstations have full channel state information (CSI) of all active users in the system. This is infeasible as\nreceivers use finite-bandwidth channels to feedback CSI to base stations (in frequency division duplex\nsystems) [18]. Another common assumption made in multicell cooperative literature is that base stations\nare connected using ideal backhaul links. In practical systems, however, the prohibitive cost of connecting\nall the base stations in the network using high-capacity links restricts backhaul capabilities [1]. While\nsharing a larger amount of information among base stations can improve performance, the extent of\ncooperation among base stations is restricted by the capacity-limited backhaul. Hence, it is important to\ndevelop cooperative techniques with limited feedback that maximize performance gains while ensuring\na manageable load on the finite-capacity backhaul.\nPerhaps the least aggressive form of cooperation is joint resource allocation or joint scheduling by base\nstations in adjacent cells [2], [3]. These strategies typically result in a small load on the backhaul link\nand possess comparatively low complexity. For example, in dynamic and fractional frequency reuse, base\nstations exchange control-level information to cooperatively assign different frequency bands of operation\nto users in adjacent cells [2]. By utilizing the available spectrum more efficiently, the techniques in [2]\nyield higher sum-rates as compared to static frequency reuse, which does not account for varying user\ntraffic. Alternatively, joint inter-cell scheduling assigns different transmission cycles to users in adjacent\ncells using opportunistic scheduling [3], introducing an expanded multiuser diversity gain relative to static\nfrequency reuse. Frequency reuse and inter-cell scheduling do not utilize all the available frequency and\ntime resources, respectively and hence, do not realize the performance gains that can be potentially\nobtained using base station cooperation [3].\nFull cooperation among base stations leads to the highest sum-rates, at the cost of increased overhead\n\n\f3\n\nassociated with the exchange of a greater amount of information among base stations. The sum-capacity\nmaximizing solution was derived and found to be achieved by the dirty paper coding (DPC) [4]\u2013[6],\n[19]. DPC requires joint precoder design, where all the base stations have perfect knowledge of the\ninterference seen by each user. DPC was proposed for single antenna cellular systems in [4]. Multicell\nDPC using MIMO was investigated in [5], and an upper bound was derived on the sum-rates achievable\nusing base station cooperation. While the approaches in [4], [5] assumed a sum-power constraint across\nall the base stations, DPC with more realistic per-base power constraints was considered in [6]. Multicell\nDPC is difficult to implement in practice due to the requirement for the base stations to have a noncausal knowledge of the interference [5], [7]. As a result, several low-complexity and relatively more\npractical joint transmission strategies were proposed in [5], [8] using full cooperation and per-base station\npower constraints. These sub-optimal linear techniques, including zero forcing, minimum mean square\nerror or null-space decomposition, yield sum-rates that are far from that of multicell DPC due to the\ntransmit power inefficiency introduced by the precoding matrices, especially for low-rank channels [5],\n[8]. Though the sub-optimal methods reduce the encoding complexity, they still require full CSI at the\nbase stations and involve the exchange of a large amount of information among base stations, resulting\nin a prohibitive load on the finite-capacity backhaul links [1], [5], [8].\nPartial cooperative strategies, where base stations exchange only the CSI of active users, offer a fair\nbalance between ensuring a reasonable load on the backhaul links and attaining the performance gains\nusing cooperation [1]. The shared CSI can be used by the base stations to design individual precoding\nmatrices (or beamforming vectors, for single-stream transmission) on site to transmit exclusively to users\nwithin their own cell [4]\u2013[6]. Most of the existing literature [9]\u2013[15] also assumes that users can feedback\nfull CSI to the base stations. A distributed approach for beamforming was studied in [9], [10] where\ntransmit symbol vectors were designed using linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation\ntechniques. The forward-backward and the sum-product Kalman smoothing algorithms were used to\niteratively obtain the transmit vector as an optimal linear MMSE estimate for a linear and a 2-D array of\ncells, respectively [9], [10]. The convergence of these iterative approaches is, however, not guaranteed.\nA distributed zero-forcing beamforming strategy was proposed in [11] using a scheduling algorithm to\nselect users with the best desired channels in each cell. The sub-optimal approach is not feasible for\npractical setups as it uses a sum-power constraint across all base stations, and only satisfies an equal\npower per base station asymptotically for a large number of users per cell [11]. Distributed transmit\n\n\f4\n\nbeamforming was also investigated in [12], where the authors propose an iterative algorithm to minimize\nthe transmit power that does not necessarily maximizie the sum-rates. The authors of [13]\u2013[15] propose\na beamforming solution to approximately maximize the sum-rates for only a two-cell system.\nIn this paper, we propose a linear beamforming strategy to approximately maximize the sum-rates\nat high signal-to-interference noise ratios (SINR) in multicell systems, using partial cooperation. The\nproposed beamforming method is similar to the two-cell approaches in [13]\u2013[15]. The cellular setup\nconsidered is based on the Wyner model [20], where neighboring base stations share only the CSI to\nbeamform independently to one active user in the cell with a single (dominant) co-channel interferer.\nThe proposed algorithm is also applicable to a finite linear array of cells. The variation in the strength\nof the desired and interfering signals is taken into account to maximize the sum-rate using a generalized\neigenvector approach. We first assume full CSI availability at base stations and a high-capacity backhaul\nto arrive at the closed-form expressions for the mutlicell beamforming vectors. We then consider the more\nrealistic limited feedback and capacity-limited backhaul in the rest of the paper. The beamforming strategy\npresented is non-iterative in nature and hence, does not have convergence issues unlike the solutions in\n[9], [10]. The linear approach in this paper uses explicit per-base station power constraints, in contrast\nto distributed zero-forcing beamforming in [11]. Further, it possesses low-complexity, and results in a\nsmaller burden on the backhaul link, in comparison to the full cooperation strategies in [4]\u2013[6], [8], while\nyielding sum-rates that are reasonably close to those of multicell DPC. Also, it can be applied to models\nwith any number of linearly arranged cells, and not just two-cell situations as in [13]\u2013[15].\nImplementing the linear beamforming strategy requires full CSI at the base stations to design the\ntransmit beamforming vectors, which may be impractical. Further, all the strategies described in [1], [4]\u2013\n[16] require full CSI at the base stations. In practice, as feedback links have finite bandwidth, quantized\nCSI is fed back to the base stations using the concept of limited feedback [18]. While limited feedback\nfor single-cell systems is well researched (refer to [18], [21] and the references within), comparatively\nless work has been done in the multicell scenario. In contrast to the single-cell case, the CSI of multiple\nchannels needs to be fed back for the cooperative-based strategies. Hence, it is not even clear how to\napply the existing multiuser limited CSI feedback techniques [22], [23] to multicell systems. Also, the\nvarying strengths of the desired and interfering channels need to be taken into account when developing\na multicell limited feedback strategy that will efficiently utilize feedback resources. Single-cell multiuser\nlimited feedback does not have to deal with the variability in signal strengths, due to the single-channel\n\n\f5\n\nfeedback. Note that the existing work in multicell cooperation that considers the difference in signal\nstrengths of the desired and interfering channels [8], [11], [16] assumes full CSI at base stations.\nIn this paper, we develop a limited feedback strategy for the proposed beamforming algorithm that will\npartition bits between the desired and interfering channels as a function of their relative strengths. For\nanalytical reasons, the desired and interfering channels are quantized using random vector quantization\n(RVQ), i.e. the quantization vectors are independently chosen from the isotropic distribution on a unit\nhypersphere [24], [25]. We first present a simple model for limited feedback of CSI in multicell systems.\nThe model requires each user to feedback quantized CSI to its own base station. Adjacent base stations\nare connected by a backhaul link, which is used to transfer the quantized CSI of only the interfering\nchannels. Hence, the requirement of a global high-capacity backhaul link is eliminated. We quantify the\nreduction in sum-rate caused by quantizing CSI using RVQ by deriving an upper-bound on the mean\nloss in sum-rate. We also present a feedback-bit allocation technique that approximately minimizes the\nmean loss in sum-rate and hence, utilizes the available feedback resources efficiently. Using the proposed\nalgorithm, we show that the sum-rates approach those of multicell DPC even for a limited feedback\nscenario.\nWe first extend the two-cell cooperative beamforming approach in [13]\u2013[15] to a multicell system where\nadjacent base stations exchange only CSI to approximately maximize sum-rate. The main contributions\nof this paper are as follows.\n\u2022\n\nWe propose a novel and simple limited feedback model for the multicell system, where each user\nfeeds back quantized CSI of the desired and interfering channels to its own base station. In the\nproposed model, the neighboring base stations exchange only the quantized interfering CSI. This\nmakes the load on the backhaul link manageable. By ensuring that only the adjacent base stations\nare connected, the requirement of a globally connected backhaul is eliminated.\n\n\u2022\n\nWe analyze the performance of the beamforming technique presented in this paper with limited\nfeedback by deriving an upper bound for the mean loss in sum-rate due to CSI quantization using\nRVQ. It is shown via simulations, that the upper bound is reasonably tight.\n\n\u2022\n\nWe present a new feedback-bit partitioning algorithm to allocate the available feedback bits between\nthe desired and interfering channels to approximately minimize the mean loss in sum-rate due to\nlimited feedback.\n\nThis paper is organized as follows. We first describe the system models used in this paper in Section\n\n\f6\n\nII. We then present the multicell beamforming strategy, and compare it with two existing beamforming\ntechniques for the full CSI case in Section III. In Section IV, we consider the limited feedback scenario\nfor the beamforming algorithm in Section III. We propose a feedback-bit allocation strategy to partition\nthe available bits between the desired and interference channels in Section V. The simulation results\nverifying the accuracy of the limited feedback algorithm are presented in Section VI.

S YSTEM M ODEL\nConsider the multicell setup shown in Fig. 1 for an array of linearly arranged cells. The multicell\nsystem used in this paper is based on the Wyner model [20]. We assume that the base station in each\ncell serves a single active user [4], using intra-cell time division multiple access. Each user is assumed\nto face interference from one of its neighboring cells, as shown in Fig. 1. The received signal power\nof the desired and interfering signals is a function of the user's location in the cell. A similar approach\nwas adopted in [8], where a user at the cell center receives a signal from only its corresponding base\nstation1 , while a user at the cell edge is subjected to interference from an adjacent cell as well. The\nresults in this paper can also be applied to modifications of the Wyner model, including the circular\narrangement of cells proposed in [11], and a finite linear cellular array. Note that the circular extension is\na generalization of the two-cell case and is equivalent to the Wyner model as the number of cells becomes\nlarge. The generalized eigenvector beamforming strategy proposed in this paper can be extended to the\nfinite-array case by accounting for the edge effects, as will be described in Section III. The Wyner model\nand its extensions are widely used in literature as they model the central factors of a cellular system like\nfading and inter-cell interference, while retaining analytical tractability [8], [11], [16]. We assume that\nthe backhaul link used for information exchange between base stations is ideal and that the time delay\nassociated with feedback and cooperation is zero.\n1\n\nIn our paper, we assume that the interference from the adjacent cell is negligible at the cell center.\n\n\f7\n\nThe number of cells in the multicell system is denoted by K , where K goes to infinity for the Wyner\nmodel. We index the users in each cell by the base station they obtain their desired signal from, i.e. the\nk th base station services the k th user, for k = 1, . . . , K . We assume that all the base stations are equipped\n\nwith Nt antennas, while each user supports a single receive antenna (i.e. multiple-input single-output, or\nMISO, system). The channel corresponding to the desired signal between the k th base station and k th\nuser is denoted by hk \u2208 CNt \u00d71 . The interfering channel between the k th user and the (k + 1)th base\nstation is given by gk+1 \u2208 CNt \u00d71 . This is illustrated in Fig. 1. The symbol transmitted from the k th base\nstation (intended for the k th user) is denoted by sk , where the transmit power, E{|sk |2 } is normalized to\none. The transmitted signals are subjected to large-scale fading, which includes distance-dependent pathloss and shadowing effects, and small-scale fading. After averaging over the small-scale fading effects,\nthe desired and interfering signal powers received at the user terminal are denoted by \u03b3k,(d) and \u03b3k,(i) ,\nrespectively, for the k th user. To facilitate analysis in different loss settings, we let \u03b3k,(i) = \u03b1k \u03b3k,(d) ,\nwhere \u03b1k \u2208 [0, 1] (i.e. the interfering signal strength can at most be equal to that of the desired signal).\nNote that a similar parameter is used in [8] to model the SNR of the interfering signal with respect to the\nreceived signal. Using the narrowband flat-fading model, the baseband discrete-time input-output relation\nfor the user in the k th cell is given by2\nyk =\n\np\np\nT\n\u03b3k,(d) hTk fk sk + \u03b3k,(i) gk+1\nfk+1 sk+1 + nk ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere yk \u2208 C is the received signal at the k th user and fk \u2208 CNt \u00d71 is the beamforming vector at the\nk th base station. Finally, nk \u2208 C is complex additive zero-mean white Gaussian noise at the receive\n\nantennas, with E{|nk |2 } = No .\nThe signal to interference noise ratio (SINR) of the k th user is given by\nSINRk =\n=\n\nNote that \u03c1k,(d) =\n\n\u03b3k,(d)\nNo\n\n\u03b3k,(d) |hTk fk |2\nT f\n2\n\u03b1k \u03b3k,(d) |gk+1\nk+1 | + No\n\n|hTk fk |2\nT f\n2\n\u03b1k |gk+1\nk+1 | +\n\n1\n\u03c1k,(d)\n\n.\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nis the received SNR of the desired signal, which is independent of the beam-\n\nforming vectors.

This is a popular\n2\n\nWe drop the discrete-time index for sake of convenience.\n\n\f8\n\nassumption in literature [26]\u2013[28]. It was shown in [28] that SNR quantization does not effect the sumrates of a single-cell multiuser MIMO system signicantly. To the best of our knowledge, the effect of\nSNR quantization on the sum-rates of a multicell system has not yet been investigated. We analyze the\nimpact of SNR quantization in our future work on cooperative beamforming. In this paper, however, we\nassume that the base stations have perfect knowledge of the SNR so we can concentrate on quantizing\nthe channel direction. The sum-rate of all the users within the system, Rs , is expressed as\nRs =\n\nX\n\nlog2 (1 + SINRk ) .\n\n(4)\n\nk\n\nIt is evident that the design of the beamforming vectors {fk }K\nk=1 influences the SINRs obtained at each\nof the users and hence, the sum-rate of the multicell system. The dependence of SINRk on both, fk and\nfk+1 (as given in (3)) implies that a joint optimization across all the active users in the multicell system\n\nis required to maximize the sum-rate. In this paper, we use a high SINR approximation to remove this\ninterdependency of users and thereby avoid an explicit joint maximization.\nIII. D ESIGNING B EAMFORMING V ECTORS A SSUMING F ULL CSI\nIn this section we present a multicell cooperative beamforming approach. First, we describe two popular\nexisting beamforming strategies, non-cooperative eigen-beamforming and cooperative zero-forcing beamforming, which we use for comparison with the proposed algorithm in Section VI. Eigen-beamforming\nmaximizes the desired signal strength, while zero-forcing beamforming nulls out the interference. Next, we\ndescribe the proposed generalized eigenvector based beamforming strategy that approximately maximizes\nthe sum-rate at high SINR, in a multicell system. We consider the multicell setup given in Section II and\nassume that full CSI is available at the base stations.\nA. Eigen-Beamforming and Zero-Forcing Beamforming\nIn eigen-beamforming, each base station transmits in a non-cooperative manner by ignoring the cochannel interference from neighboring base stations, as in the case of single-cell single-user beamforming\n[29]. For MIMO systems, the beamforming vector is chosen to be the eigenvector corresponding to the\nmaximum eigenvalue of the MIMO channel. For a MISO system, the eigen-beamforming vector, fk , is\nreduced to\nfk =\n\nhck\n.\nkhk k\n\n(5)\n\n\f9\n\nNote that (5) maximizes the numerator in (3). Eigen-beamforming maximizes the data rate that can be\nobtained in single-cell single-user systems, with no inter-user or inter-cell interference.\nThe zero-forcing approach in [5] requires base stations to share data in addition to CSI. To ensure\nfair comparison with the beamforming strategy presented, we implement zero-forcing with single-cell\nprocessing in a way that only CSI is shared between base stations, using a principle similar to that in [5].\nAdjacent base stations exchange the interfering channel state information between each other, so that the\nk th base station has the knowledge of both hk and gk . Assuming full CSI at the transmitter, the multicell\n\nzero-forcing criterion requires that |gkT fk |2 = 0, where fk\u2217 fk = 1. Denoting Wk = [hTk , gkT ]\u2020 , the zero\nforcing beamforming vector is designed by setting\nfk =\n\nWk (:, 1)\n.\nkWk (:, 1)k\n\n(6)\n\nNote that gkT Wk (:, 1) = 0, and hence, the solution in (6) minimizes the denominator in (3).\nB. Proposed Beamforming Strategy for Approximately Maximizing Sum-Rate at High SINR\nIn this section, we present a linear multicell cooperative beamforming strategy (for the setup in\nSection II), based on the two-cell beamforming solution proposed in [13]\u2013[15]. The approach in [13],\n[14] approximately maximizes the sum-rate for a two-cell MISO system where base stations are assumed\nto have full CSI. In this paper, we extend the analysis to develop a cooperative beamforming technique\nthat approximately maximizes the sum-rates in the high SINR regime in a multicell system.\nAt high SINR, since log(1 + SINR) \u2248 log(SINR), (4) can be expressed as\n!\nX\nY\nRs \u2248\nlog2 (SINRk ) = log2\nSINRk .\nk\n\n(7)\n\nk\n\nThus, maximizing the sum-rate, Rs , approximately at high SINR involves maximizing the product of the\nSINRs3 . The beamforming vectors {fk }K\nk=1 are found by solving\nRs,opt = max\nK\n\n{fk }k=1\n\nlog2\n\nK\nY\n\n|hTk fk |2\n\u03b1 |gT f |2 +\nk=1 k k+1 k+1\n\n!\n1\n\ns.t. kfk k2 = 1, for k = 1, . . . , K .\n\n(8)\n\n\u03c1k,(d)\n\nTaking advantage of the commutativity of the multiplication operation, the objective function can be\n3\n\nWe show, using simulations, in Section VI that the approximation is tight for small \u03b1k or large \u03c1k,(d) .\n\n\f10\n\nwritten as\nRs,opt = max\nK\n\n{fk }k=1\n\nX\nk\n\nlog2\n\n|hTk fk |2\n\u03b1k\u22121 |gkT fk |2 +\n\n!\ns.t. kfk k2 = 1, k = 1, . . . , K .\n\n1\n\n(9)\n\n\u03c1k\u22121,(d)\n\nThe k th base station uses CSI of hk and gk to obtain the optimal fk , implying that the sum-rate can be\napproximately maximized by each base station exchanging CSI only with its neighbors. This eliminates\nthe need for global CSI knowledge and reduces the load on the finite-capacity backhaul link.\nNow, (9) deals with maximizing a function consisting of K independent variables, {fk }K\nk=1 . Hence,\nit can be split into K independent problems. Thus, the high SINR approximation is used to remove the\ninterdependency of the users in (4). The optimal linear beamforming vector, fk,opt , is the solution to\nfk,opt = arg max\n\nf :kf k2 =1\n\nf \u2217 Rhk f\n,\nf \u2217 Rgk f\n\n(10)\n\nwhere Rhk = hk h\u2217k and Rgk = \u03c1k\u22121,(i) gk gk\u2217 + INt , and \u03c1k\u22121,(i) = \u03b1k\u22121 \u03c1k\u22121,(d) is the received SNR\nof the intereference signal at the (k \u2212 1)th user. The expression in (10) is the well known generalized\nRayleigh quotient [30]. Since Rhk and Rgk are Hermitian and Rgk is positive definite4 , the solution to\n(10) is given by the generalized eigenvalue decomposition:\nRhk f = \u03bbk Rgk f ,\n\n(11)\n\n\u2217\nwhere \u03bbk denotes the eigenvalues of R\u22121\ngk Rhk [31]. Due to the rank deficient nature of Rhk (= hk hk ),\n\nthere exists only one non-zero eigenvalue. The solution to (10) will then be equal to the generalized\neigenvector corresponding to the non-zero (maximum) eigenvalue. The solution for fk,opt is invariant to\nan angular rotation, \u03b8, of the beamforming vector, ej\u03b8 fk,opt . Hence, there can be infinitely many solutions\nto (10). The unit-norm and rotationally invariant nature of fk,opt implies that it is a point on the Grassmann\nmanifold, used popularly in single-cell limited-feedback literature [18].\nNote that while (11) can be used to approximately maximize the sum-rate for both an infinite linear\narray (in Fig. 1) and a circular arrangement of cells, it can also be used for a finite cellular array by\naccounting for edge effects and using (11) for k = 2, . . . , K . The base station in the first cell of the array\ndoes not cause interference (\u03b10 = 0), implying that optimal beamforming vector is given by (5). Hence,\n(11) can be used for any K , while the solution in [13], [14] approximately maximizes sum-rates for only\n4\n\nRgk is positive definite (and hence, full rank) as x\u2217 Rgk x = x\u2217 (\u03c1k\u22121,(i) gk gk\u2217 + INt )x > 0, for all x 6= 0.\n\n\f11\n\nK = 2. Also, while it is recognized that the ratio in (9) is similar to the signal-to-leakage-noise-ratio\n\n(SLNR) proposed in [32] for multiuser MIMO, the single-cell SLNR solution does not bear a direct\nimpact on the sum-rates obtained and is shown to yield low sum-rates in the high SINR regime [33].\nIn contrast, we show in (9) that (approximately) maximizing the sum-rate at high SINR is equivalent to\nmaximizing SLNR at each base station for the multicell setup in Section II.\nIV. D ESIGNING B EAMFORMING V ECTORS U SING L IMITED F EEDBACK\nIn Section III, we presented a beamforming approach to approximately maximize the sum-rate at high\nSINR in a multicell setting by assuming that full CSI of the desired and interfering channels was available\nat the base station. A reasonable way to inform the base station about the channel state is through a\nlimited feedback channel. In this section, we propose a limited feedback approach for multicell generalized\neigenvector beamforming, where the quantized CSI of both the desired and interfering channels is fed\nback over the feedback link. The available feedback resources can be utilized efficiently in the multicell\ncase by taking into account the relative strengths of the desired and interfering channels. Note that this\nis in contrast to single-cell multiuser limited feedback case, where only the CSI of a single channel is\nfed back [22], [23].\nThe limited feedback model for the multicell setup in Section II is described in Fig. 2. It is assumed\nthat the k th user can perfectly estimate the desired and interfering channels, hk and gk+1 , using separate\ntraining symbols from the k th and (k + 1)th base stations, respectively. The k th receiver uses Bk,(d)\nand Bk,(i) bits to feed back quantized versions of the hk and gk+1 , respectively, over a limited feedback\nchannel where Bk,(d) + Bk,(i) = Btot is fixed. Note that Bk,(d) and Bk,(i) will depend on the relative\nstrength of the interfering and desired signals (\u03b1k ). For example, when \u03b1k \u2192 0 at the cell center, the\ncontribution of the desired channel towards the SINR is greater than that of the interfering channel and\nit becomes more important to reduce the loss due to quantization of hk as compared to that due to gk+1 .\nThis can be done by allocating most of the feedback bits to quantize hk , i.e. Bk,(d) \u2248 Btot . Hence, the\ntwo channels, hk and gk+1 , are quantized separately using two separate codebooks of (variable) sizes\n2Bk,(d) (denoted by Wk,(d)) ) and 2Bk,(i) (given by Wk,(i) ), respectively.\n\nThe unit-norm direction of the estimated desired (and interfering) channel is given by h\u0303k = hk /khk k\n(g\u0303k+1 = gk+1 /kgk+1 k). The channel directions are then mapped to the respective codebook entries with\nthe smallest angular separations. The quantized vectors for the desired and interfering channels, denoted\n\n\f12\n\nby \u0125k and \u011dk+1 , respectively, are obtained using\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0125k = arg max |h\u0303\u2217k w|2 = arg max cos2 \u2220(h\u0303k , w) , and\nw\u2208Wk,(d)\n\n(12)\n\nw\u2208Wk,(d)\n\n\u2217\n\u011dk+1 = arg max |g\u0303k+1\nw|2 = arg max cos2 (\u2220(g\u0303k+1 , w)) .\nw\u2208Wk,(i)\n\n(13)\n\nw\u2208Wk,(i)\n\nSince the channel gains, khk k and kgk+1 k, are scalars and can be quantized easily, we concentrate on\nquantizing the channel directions, h\u0303k and g\u0303k+1 and assume that the base stations have perfect knowledge\nof khk k. This is a popular assumption made in multiuser MIMO literature [26]\u2013[28]. As quantizing\nchannel gain is (to the best of our knowledge) not investigated for multicell systems, we use the perfect\nkhk k and kgk+1 k knowledge at base station assumption. We will analyze the impact of quantizing channel\n\ngain in our future work on limited feedback for multicell systems.\nFrom (9), it is seen that the k th base station requires information about both hk and gk to compute fk .\nIn the limited feedback model presented in this paper, the k th base station has information of both \u0125k\nand \u011dk+1 (in addition to perfect knowledge of khk k and kgk+1 k). The interfering channel information,\nkgk+1 k, is then sent from the k th to the (k + 1)th base station via the backhaul link. In this manner,\n\neach base station has knowledge of not only its own desired channel, but also of the interference that is\ncausing to the user in the adjacent cell.\nAs codebook design for multicell systems is a topic of ongoing research, we use RVQ for channel\nquantization to facilitate analysis. If we use B bits for feedback, then each of the 2B codebook vectors\nis independently chosen from the isotropic distribution on the Nt dimensional unit sphere [24], [25].\nThe beamforming vector at the k th base station using limited CSI feedback, f\u0302k is then computed as the\ngeneralized eigenvector satisfying\nR\u0125k f\u02c6k = \u03bbk R\u011dk f\u02c6k ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere R\u0125k = khk k2 \u0125k \u0125\u2217k and R\u011dk = \u03c1k\u22121,(i) kgk k2 \u011dk \u011dk\u2217 + INt . Quantization of CSI leads to a loss in\nthe sum-rate. In this paper, we develop a feedback-bit partitioning strategy to approximately minimize\nthe mean loss in sum-rate given by\nE{\u2206Rs } \u2248E{Rs,full \u2212 Rs,LF }\n(\nX\n|hTk fk,full |2\n=E\nlog2\nT f\n2\n\u03b1k |gk+1\nk+1,full | +\nk\n\n!\n1\n\u03c1k,(d)\n\n\u2212\n\nX\nk\n\nlog2\n\n!)\n\n|hTk f\u0302k |2\nT f\u0302\n2\n\u03b1k |gk+1\nk+1 | +\n\n1\n\u03c1k,(d)\n\n,\n\n(15)\n\n\f13\n\nwhere Rs,full is the sum-rate obtained using the high SINR approximation with full CSI at the base station,\nas given in (9) and Rs,LF refers to the sum-rate using limited feedback. Also, fk+1,full corresponds to the\nfull CSI beamforming vector (from (11)).\nV. O PTIMIZING F EEDBACK B ITS TO M INIMIZE THE M EAN L OSS IN S UM -R ATE AT H IGH SINR\nThe beamforming strategy proposed in Sections III-B and IV requires channel state information of both\nthe desired and interfering channel at the base station. As the number of available feedback bits, Btot is\nfixed, it is possible that allocating feedback bits between the desired and interfering channels can further\nimprove the limited feedback sum-rate. In this section, we propose a feedback-bit allocation strategy\nto numerically evaluate the number of bits required to quantize the desired and interfering channels\nusing RVQ. We model all the channels by the Rayleigh fading model, where each entry is a zero-mean\nunit-variance complex Gaussian independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variable according\nto Nc (0, 1). While it is recognized that Rayleigh fading does not model realistic propagation channels\naccurately, we use the i.i.d. assumption in the limited feedback analysis to obtain closed-form expressions\nof the mean loss in sum-rate and feedback-bit partitioning algorithms.\nMaximizing the mean sum-rate using generalized eigenvector beamforming with limited feedback is\nequivalent to minimizing E{\u2206Rs } in (15), which is rewritten as\n!)\n(\n!)\n(\nT f\u0302\n2\nX\nX\n\u03c1k,(i) |gk+1\n|hTk fk,full |2\nk+1 | + 1\n+\nE log2\n,\nE{\u2206Rs } =\nE log2\nT f\n2\n\u03c1k,(i) |gk+1\n|hTk f\u02c6k |2\nk+1,full | + 1\nk\nk\n|\n{z\n}\n|\n{z\n}\nTk,(d)\n\n(16)\n\nTk,(i)\n\nby interchanging the terms inside the logarithms. The mean loss in sum-rate can be viewed to be\na contribution of two terms, namely Tk,(d) and Tk,(i) , corresponding to the mean loss resulting from\nquantizing the desired and interfering channels, respectively. Note that Tk,(d) and Tk,(i) depend only on\nBk,(d) and Bk,(i) , the number of bits used to quantize the desired and intereference channels, respectively,\n\nand are independent of Tl,(d) and Tl,(i) , for k 6= l. Therefore, minimizing (16) is equivalent to minimizing\n\u2206k = Tk,(d) + Tk,(i) for each k . Since obtaining a closed form expression for (16) is complicated, we\n\nderive an upper bound for E{\u2206Rs } in terms of bounds on Tk,(d) and Tk,(i) .\nBefore we proceed, we present a lemma that is used to derive an upper bound on (16).

Note that for \u03b1k = 0, Bk,(d) opt = Btot . This implies that when the interfering\nsignal has zero power (or there is no interferer transmitting), all the available bits will be used to quantize\nthe desired signal. In the absence of interference, it is evident that the strength of the received signal,\n\u03c1k,(d) does not affect the bits allocated. In contrast, when \u03b1k = 1, Bk,(d) opt increases as \u03c1k,(d) decreases.\n\nThis makes intuitive sense because if the desired signal strength is high, fewer feedback bits are assigned\nto the desired channel and vice versa. In Section VI, we show that the values of (Bk,(d) , Bk,(i) ) from\nTheorem 4 match the simulation results.\nVI. S IMULATION R ESULTS\nIn this section, we present simulation results for the case when full CSI is available at the base station\nand then present results for the limited feedback scenario. We show that the feedback-bit allocation\nstrategy described in Section V approximately minimizes the mean loss in sum-rate due to quantization.\nSimulations are also used to verify that the partitioning of feedback bits between the desired and interfering\nchannels proposed in Theorem 4 and Corollary 5 matches numerical results.\nUnless otherwise stated, we assume that all K users have the same received desired and interfering\n\n\f16\n\nsignal strengths, i.e., \u03c1k,(d) = \u03c1(d) and \u03b1k = \u03b1, for all k , for simplicity. We provide simulation results\nfor the asymmetric case at the end of this section.\nA. Full CSI Case\nIn Section III, a high SINR approximation was made to approximately maximize the sum-rates in\na distributed fashion across base stations. In Fig. 3, we verify that the approximation yields sum-rates\nthat are reasonably close to the actual values for \u03c1(d) values as small as 5 dB , for Nt = K = 4 and\n\u03b1 = {0.001, 0.1, 1}. In Fig. 4, we show that as K (number of cells or users) increases, GEBF yields\n\nsum-rates that are very close to the upper-bound using multicell DPC for K users for Nt = 4 and\n\u03c1(d) = 10 dB . Though the difference in sum-rates is maximum for \u03b1 = 1 because of a general drop\n\nin the SINR of each user due to increased interference from adjacent cells, it is seen that the multicell\nGEBF presented in this paper yields sum-rates reasonably close to the upper bound from DPC.\nB. Limited CSI Feedback\nThe upper bound on the reduction in sum-rate (due to quantization) was derived in Section V, by\nassuming that the number of bits available for both, the desired and interfering channels are large enough\nto ignore quantization errors. Hence, in the simulation results presented in this section, for a Btot bit\nfeedback system, we assume that Bk,(d) \u2208 [3, Btot \u2212 3], as using RVQ codebooks of size 23 = 8\nleads to low values of quantization error. In Fig. 5, for \u03c1(d) = 10 dB , Btot = 15, K = Nt = 2 and\n\u03b1 = {0.001, 0.1, 1}, it is shown that the upper bound derived in (19) is reasonably tight near the minimum\n\nmean loss in sum-rate. It is evident that partitioning adaptively the feedback bits, as a function of the\nlocation of the mobile terminal, is an effective method to increase the sum-rates obtained in limited\nfeedback systems. This implies that the upper bound derived in (19) can be used to evaluate the number\nof quantization bits needed to minimize the mean sum-rate loss. Further, Fig. 5 clearly demonstrates the\nconvexity of the actual loss in sum-rate and the upper bound in (19).\nNext, we present simulation results to show that GEBF with the proposed feedback-bit partitioning algorithm outperforms non-cooperative eigen-beamforming and multicell zero-forcing beamforming\nstrategies with limited CSI feedback. Since the eigen-beamforming approach described in Section IV\nis non-cooperative, all the available feedback bits are used to quantize the desired channel only, i.e.\nBk,(d) EBF = Btot , whereas for multicell zero-forcing approach, Bk,(d) ZF = Bk,(i) ZF = Btot /2 is\n\nassumed. Fig. 6 shows the sum-rates that can be obtained using the three transmission strategies for\n\n\f17\n\na two-cell (two-user) scenario with Btot = 6 and \u03c1(d) = 10 dB and K = Nt = 2. It is seen that the\nproposed limited feedback algorithm yields higher sum-rates. As \u03b1 increases, the sum-rates using both\nGEBF and non-cooperative eigen-beamforming reduce, but that of eigen-beamforming falls off more\ndrastically. This is because as \u03b1 \u2192 1, interference becomes significant and the beamforming vector\nneeds to reduce the interference in addition to increasing the desired signal strength. Zero forcing with\nfull CSI yields a constant sum-rate for all values of \u03b1 due to the nulling out of the interference term in\nthe denominator of (3).\nThe sum-rates obtained using the proposed bit-partitioning technique as Btot increases are compared\nin Fig. 7 for Nt = K = 2 and \u03c1(d) = 10 dB for \u03b1 = {0.001, 0.1, 1}. It is seen that the cell-edge\nusers (\u03b1 \u2192 1) requires a larger Btot as compared to users in the cell-center (\u03b1 \u2192 1). This is due to\nthe requirement of cell-edge users to quantize the interfering channel (in addition to the desired channel)\nwith a sufficiently high resolution. In contrast, users in the cell-center that have weak interfering signals\nhave to only ensure that the desired channel is allocated sufficient number of feedback bits. Hence, the\nfeedback-bits, Btot can be varied adaptively as a function of the user location within the cell to yield a\ngiven sum-rate.\nIn Fig. 8, we show the variation in the number of bits allocated to the desired and interfering channels\nas a function of the interfering to desired signal ratio, given by \u03b1\u0303 = 10 log10 (\u03b1) dB . In Fig. 8, for\nK = Nt = 2 and \u03c1(d) = 10 dB , we can see that when the difference in path-loss is greater than 37 dB ,\n(Bk,(d) , Bk,(i) ) = (8, 0). As the path-loss difference decreases, Bk,(d) reduces and Bk,(i) increases, due to\n\nan increasing need to quantize the interfering channel with greater resolution. When both the desired and\ninterfering channels have the same signal strength, it is seen that (Bk,(d) , Bk,(i) ) = (2, 6), i.e. reducing\nthe interfering signal strength is 'more important' to maximize the sum-rate than increasing the desired\nsignal strength.\nFinally, we consider the case where the users are randomly located in their cells and have different\ninterfering to desired signal ratios, i.e. \u03b1\u0303k 6= \u03b1\u0303l , k 6= l. Hence, the users can have different feedback\nbit allocations. The performance of the proposed feedback-bit allocation strategy with GEBF can be\nexamined for the asymmetric scenario by evaluating the average data-rate in a cell, where the average\nis taken over all possible user locations in the cell. Assuming Btot = 6 at each user, we consider 1000\ncells (users) arranged in a linear fashion, with \u03b1\u0303k uniformly distributed between [\u221240 dB, 0 dB], for all\nk . Adjacent cells cooperate by sharing the interfering channel CSI to compute the bit partitions for each\n\n\f18\n\nuser independently. In Fig. 9, it is seen that the average data-rate in a cell using the proposed feedback-bit\nallocation strategy is reasonably close to that obtained using GEBF with full CSI. We also show that\nthe data rate obtained using equal bit partitioning in GEBF, i.e. Bk,(d) = Bk,(i) = Btot /2 for all k is\nless than that obtained using the proposed bit allocation, especially for larger \u03c1(d) . This makes intuitive\nsense as the equal bit allocation does not reduce the quantization error, which grows with larger \u03c1(d) ,\nwhile the proposed strategy allocates bit adaptively to minimize the overall impact of quantization error.\nWe also plot the average data rates obtained using the non-cooperative eigenbeamforming and multicell\nzero-forcing approaches (described in Section III-A) with limited feedback. The proposed feedback-bit\nstrategy with GEBF outperforms both, EBF and ZF, especially at larger values of \u03c1(d) . Hence, it can be\nconcluded that the proposed limited feedback strategy is effective in multicell systems.\nVII. C ONCLUSION\nWe first presented a beamforming strategy that uses cooperation among base stations in a multicell\nMISO system to approximately maximize the sum-rate at high SINR. A linear array of cells based on\nthe Wyner model is considered, in addition to a circular extension of the model. For the limited feedback\nscenario, we presented a feedback-bit allocation strategy to approximately minimize the mean loss in\nsum-rate caused due to quantization using RVQ. The proposed technique relies on the relative strength\nbetween the desired and interfering signals within the cell to allocate bits adaptively to each of the two\nchannels. A closed form expression for the number of feedback bits was derived. Using simulations, it\nwas shown that the multicell beamforming approach yields sum-rates reasonably close to those obtained\nusing multicell DPC, with full CSI. The average data rate in a cell using the feedback-bit allocation\nstrategy was also shown to reasonably close to the full CSI case, verifying that the proposed multicell\nlimited feedback algorithm yields high sum-rates using partial cooperation.\nA PPENDIX I\nP ROOF OF L EMMA 1\n\u0010\n\u0011\nIt was shown in [36] that the probability density function of \u03bd = cos2 \u2220(h\u0303, \u0125) is given by\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\nt \u22121) \u0012\nN i(N\nX\nX\nN\ni(Nt \u2212 1)\nf\u03bd (\u03bd) =\n(\u22121)i+j j\u03bd j\u22121 ,\ni\nj\ni=0\n\nj=1\n\n\f19\n\nwhere N = 2Bk,(i) is the size of the RVQ codebook.
