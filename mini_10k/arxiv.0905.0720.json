As examples, we prove\nthat the string vibration equation and the KdV equation are L-integrable.\nIn general, we show that an infinite number of integrals is complete if all\naction variables of a Hamilton system can reconstructed by the set of first\nintegrals.\nKeywords: Hamilton-Jacobi theory, Liouville integrability, the KdV\nequation, string vibration equation, integrable system.\nPACS: 02.30.Ik, 05.45.Yv\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt is well-known that an infinite dimensional Hamilton system such as KdV equation can be considered as a complete integrable system[1,2] if it can be solved\nby the inverse scattering method[3,4]. In other words, if we can obtain its all\naction-angle variables, we call this system to be complete integrable and sometimes the Liouville integrable. Finite-dimensional Liouville theorem[5] says that\nif there exist n independent first integrals in evolution, the Hamilton system is\nsolvable. The so-called liouville integrability is just based on the Liouville theorem. For a given Hamilton system in infinite dimension, a necessary condition\nin order to make such system integrable is that it posses an infinite number of\n1\n\n\fconstants of motion (or called first integrals). F. Calogero[6] point out that due\nto the ambiguities in the counting of infinities, this condition is not sufficient. A\nnatural problem is how many constants of motion are sufficient to ensure that\nsuch system is solvable. We call this problem the Calogero's problem. Indeed,\nwe are short of an infinite-dimensional Liouville theorem from which the above\nquestion can be solved naturally.\nOn the other hand, all action variables gives \"all\" constants of motion.\nTherefore, beginning from the action variables, we can understand the essence\nof the Calogero's problem on infinite number of constants of motion. But classical Liouville integrability is not equivalent to the solvability of the action-angle\nvariables in infinite dimension. In order to give an equivalent definition, we\nneed to modify the conditions in the classical Liouville integrability such that\nthe new Liouville integrability is equivalent to the solvability of the action-angle\nvariables. At the same time, the Calogero's problem is solved naturally. This is\na way from back to head. But we need a way from head to back!\nIn the present paper, our aim is to extend the Hamilton-Jacobi theory and\nLiouville integrability (for example, see Arnold's book [5]) from the finitedimensional case to the infinite-dimensional case. We establish an infinitedimensional Hamilton-Jacobi theory, and prove an infinite-dimensional Liouville\ntheorem. Furthermore, based on the theorem, a modified definition of the Liouville integrability in infinite dimension is given. We call it L-integrability. As\nthe application of the theory, we study the string vibration problem in detail.\nWe use the Hamilton-Jacobi theory to solve it. We give an infinite number of\nfirst integrals and prove that this is a complete set, that is, the string vibration\nproblem is L-integrable. We also discuss the problem about the uncomplete first\nintegrals. Finally, as an important example, we prove that the KdV equation is\nL-integrable. Our results answer the Calogero's problem.\nWe must point out that the advantage of our theory is not in technique but\nin concept since it is difficult to solve Hamilton-Jacobi equation directly by the\nmethod of the variables separation.\nOther definitions of integrability such as Lax integrability, C-integrability,\ncan be found in Ref.[4].\n\n2\n\nInfinite-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi theory\n\nWe consider the case of countably infinite variables. P = (p1 , * * * , pn , * * * ) and\nQ = (q1 , * * * , qn , * * * ) are a pair of canonical variables. H = H(P, Q, t) is the\nHamilton function. The Hamilton canonical equations are as follows\n\u2202H\ndqi\n,\n=\ndt\n\u2202pi\n\n(1)\n\n\u2202H\ndpi\n,\n(2)\n=\u2212\ndt\n\u2202qi\nfor i = 1, 2, * * * . S denote the action function which takes its value on the\n\u2202S\n\u2202S\nfor i = 1, 2, * * * and denote them by P = \u2202Q\nclassical path. We have pi = \u2202q\ni\n2\n\n\ffor simplicity.

A crucial step is\nthat we must can solve out Q = Q(t, \u03b1, \u03b2) from the following system of equations\n\u2202S\n= \u03b2i ,\n\u2202\u03b1i\n\n(4)\n\nfor i = 1, 2, * * * , where \u03b2 = (\u03b21 , \u03b22 , * * * ).

An infinite number of motion constants (or first integrals)(13)\nis called a complete set of motion constants if the condition 20 is satisfied.\nDefinition 2. If a Hamilton system has a complete set of motion constants,\nthe system is called to possess the L- integrability or to be L-integrable.\nRemark 1. In 2n-dimensional phase space case, Liouville integrability needs\nn independent first integrals in involution, which are not sufficient in infinite dimension since we can take away some first integrals, for example, arbitrary finite\nnumber of first integrals, such that two conditions of involution and independence are remained as before. In our new definition 2, we take the completeness\ninstead of involution and independence. Theorem 2 is the theoretical foundation\nof definition 2. If a soliton equation posses an infinite number of independent\nfirst integrals in involution, what we need is only to verify whether this set of\nfirst integrals is complete. We will take some concrete examples as verification.\n\n4\n\nThe L-integrability of an infinite-dimensional\nharmonic oscillator\n\nConsider the string vibration equation\nutt = uxx ,\n\n(29)\n\nu(0, t) = u(2\u03c0, t) = 0,\n\n(30)\n\nu(x, 0) = u0 (x), ut (x, 0) = u1 (x),\n\n(31)\n\nwhich is an infinite-dimensional harmonic oscillator. The corresponding Lagrangian function and Hamilton function are\nZ\n1 2\u03c0\nL=\n((ut )2 \u2212 (ux )2 )dx,\n(32)\n2 0\nand\nH=\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\n((ut )2 + (ux )2 )dx.\n\n(33)\n\n0\n\nLet q = u and p = ut be a pair of canonical variables. Then Hamilton function\nis rewritten as\nZ\n1 2\u03c0 2\n(p + (qx )2 )dx.\n(34)\nH(p, q) =\n2 0\n6\n\n\fTherefore the Hamilton canonical system is just Eq.(29). The Hamilton-Jacobi\nequation is given by\nZ\n\u2202S\n1 2\u03c0 \u03b4S 2\n=\u2212\n(35)\n{( ) + (qx )2 }dx\n\u2202t\n2 0\n\u03b4q\nBy the separation of variables, we let\nS(q, t) = S0 (t) + S1 (q),\n\n(36)\n\nwhere S1 (q) is a functional of q. Substituting Eq.(36) into Hamilton-Jacobi\nequation (35) and separating the variables yield\nS0\u2032 (t) = \u2212\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\n{(\n\n0\n\n1\n\u03b4S1 2\n) + (qx )2 }dx = \u2212\n\u03b4q\n2\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\n\u03b2(x)dx = \u2212E.\n\n(37)\n\n0\n\nIt follows that\nS0 (t) = \u2212Et,\n\n(38)\n\n\u03b4S1 2\n) + (qx )2 = \u03b2(x),\n(39)\n\u03b4q\nR 2\u03c0\nwhere \u03b2(x) is an arbitrary function satisfying 12 0 \u03b2(x)dx = E. For example,\nwe can take \u03b2(x) = 2E. But we must point out that Eq.(39) is a variationdifferential equation and we don't know how to solve it in general case.\nNow we adopt another method to deal with these problems. Take Fourier\ntransformation of u with respect to x,\n(\n\nu(x, t) =\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\nan (t) sin(nx),\n\n(40)\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\na\u2032n (t) sin(nx).\n\n(41)\n\nn=1\n\nthen\nut (x, t) =\n\nn=1\n\nTherefore the Hamiltonian function becomes\nH=\n\n+\u221e\n1 X \u20322\n{a (t) + n2 a2n (t)}.\n2 n=1 n\n\n(42)\n\nTaking\nS(a1 (t), a2 (t), * * * ) = S0 (t) +\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\nSn (an ),\n\n(43)\n\nn=1\n\nand substituting it into Hamilton-Jacobi equation yield\n(\n\ndSn 2\n) + n2 a2n = En , n = 1, 2, * * * ,\ndan\n7\n\n(44)\n\n\fwhere En\u2032 s are constants and satisfy the following condition\n+\u221e\nX\n\nEn = 2E.\n\n(45)\n\nn=1\n\nSolving Eq.(44), we have\nSn =\n\nZ p\nEn \u2212 n2 a2n dan .\n\n(46)\n\nAccording to the standard steps we can solve out the solutions of an , for\nn = 1, 2, * * * . Hence we can use the Hamilton-Jacobi theory to solve the string\nvibration problem.\nWe next obtain the L-integrability of the string vibration equation. We first\ngive an infinite number of first integrals\nZ 2\u03c0\nZ 2\u03c0\n1\n1\nfn (u, ut ) = n2 (\nu(x, t) sin(nx)dx)2 + (\nut (x, t) sin(nx)dx)2 , (47)\n2\n2 0\n0\nfor n = 1, 2, * * * . Indeed, we have\nZ 2\u03c0\nZ 2\u03c0\nd\nfn (u, ut ) = n2\nu(x, t) sin(nx)dx\nut (x, t) sin(nx)dx\ndt\nZ 2\u03c0 0\nZ 2\u03c0 0\n+\nut (x, t) sin(nx)dx\nutt (x, t) sin(nx)dx = 0,\n0\n\n(48)\n\n0\n\nwhere we use utt = uxx and integration by part in last step. Rewriting the first\nintegrals in terms of variables a\u2032n s, we have\nfn =\n\n1 \u20322\n(a (t) + n2 a2n (t)), n = 1, 2, * * * .\n2 n\n\n(49)\n\nTherefore, every fn is just the energy of the nth mode. The physical picture of\nthese first integrals is very clear.\nWe now prove these first integrals constitute a complete set. Indeed, in this\ncase, the canonical variables are qn = an and pn = a\u2032n . From the set of first\nintegrals (49) represented by fn = 12 (p2n (t) + n2 qn2 (t)) in terms of qn and pn , we\ncan solve out the p\u2032n s. It follows that this is a complete set. On the other hand,\nwe have\n\u2202fn\n= \u03b4mn,\n(50)\n\u2202qm\nwhere \u03b4mn is the Dirac sign in infinite dimension, that is, the operator (matrix)\n\u2202fn\n( \u2202q\n) is invertible. Of course, [fn , fm ] = 0 is a simple fact. According to\nm\ntheorem 2, the string vibration problem is L-integrable.\nIf we remove some first integrals in the set (49), the set will be not complete.\nIndeed, for example, we remove f1 , then the remains are also evolutional and\nindependent. But it is easy to see that the remains are not complete since we\n\u2202fn +\u221e\n)\nisn't\ncan't solve out p1 . In other words, the operator (matrix) ( \u2202q\nm m=1,n=2\ninvertible.\n8\n\n\f5\n\nThe L-integrability of the infinite vibrating\nstring\n\nWe consider the Cauchy problem for an infinite vibrating string\nutt = uxx ,\n\n(51)\n\nu(\u2212\u221e, t) = u(+\u221e, t) = 0,\n\n(52)\n\nu(x, 0) = u0 (x), ut (x, 0) = u1 (x).\n\n(53)\n\nWe take the Fourier transformation of u(x, t) with respect to the variable x,\nZ +\u221e\n1\nu(x, t) =\na(y, t) sin(xy)dy.\n(54)\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\nIt is easy to prove that\nf (y, t) =\n\n1 2\n{at (y, t) + y 2 a2 (y, t)},\n2\n\n(55)\n\nor in another form\nZ +\u221e\nZ +\u221e\n1 1\n2\n2 1\nf (y, t) = {(\nut (x, t) sin(xy)dx) + y (\nu(x, t) sin(xy)dx)2 },\n2 2\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\n(56)\nd\nf (y, t) = 0. This first integral is just\nis a first integral for every y, that is, dt\nthe energy of the y-th mode. They constitute a set of the first integrals with\nuncountably infinite elements. In order to construct a countably infinite number\nof first integrals, we take the Taylor expansion of f (y, t) with respect to the\nvariable y\n+\u221e n\nX\nd f (0, t) n\ny .\n(57)\nf (y, t) =\ndtn\nn=o\nThen every\n\ndn f (0,t)\ndtn\n\nis a first integral. Through tedious computation, we obtain\n\nf (y, t) = g1 y 2 + g2 y 4 + * * * + gk y 2k + * * * ,\nwhere\n\nZ\ng1 = (\n\n+\u221e\n\nxut (x, t)dx)2 ,\n\n(58)\n\n(59)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ngk =\nk\u22122\nX\n\n(\u22121)k+1\n(2k \u2212 1)!\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\nxut (x, t)dx\n\u2212\u221e\nZ +\u221e\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\nx2k\u22121 ut (x, t)dx\n\u2212\u221e\n\nZ +\u221e\n(\u22121)k\n{\nx2(k\u2212m)\u22123 udx\nx2m+1 udx\n(2m\n+\n1)!(2(k\n\u2212\nm)\n\u2212\n3)!\n\u2212\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nm=0\nZ +\u221e\nZ +\u221e\n1\n\u2212\nx2(k\u2212m)\u22121 ut dx\nx2m+1 ut dx}, (60)\n(2(k \u2212 m) \u2212 2)(2(k \u2212 m) \u2212 1) \u2212\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n+\n\n9\n\n\ffor k = 2, 3, * * * . Every gn is a first integral. We will prove that they constitute\na complete set of first integrals. For the purpose, we first take the canonical\ncoordinates as\nZ\n+\u221e\n\nqn =\n\nx2n+1 udx,\n\n(61)\n\nx2n+1 ut dx,\n\n(62)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\npn =\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nfor n = 0, 1, * * * . In terms of the canonical coordinates, we rewrite gk as\ng1 = p20 ,\nk\u22122\nX\n(\u22121)k\n(\u22121)k+1\np0 pk\u22121 +\n(2k \u2212 1)!\n(2m + 1)!(2(k \u2212 m) \u2212 3)!\nm=0\n1\n\u00d7{qk\u2212m\u22122 qm \u2212\npk\u2212m\u22121 pm },\n(2(k \u2212 m) \u2212 2)(2(k \u2212 m) \u2212 1)\n\n(63)\n\ngk =\n\n(64)\n\nfor k = 2, 3, * * * . From the system of equations gk = \u03b2k for k = 0, 1, * * * , we can\neasily solve out the pn for n = 0, 1, * * * , since these equations all are quadratic.\nIndeed, we have\np\n(65)\np 0 = \u00b1 \u03b21 ,\npk =\n\nk\u22122\nX\n(2k + 1)!\n(\u22121)k\n1\n{(\u22121)k \u03b2k+1 +\nq0 qk\u22121 \u2212\n2\n(2k \u2212 1)!\n(2m + 1)!(2(k \u2212 m) \u2212 3)!\nm=1\n1\npk\u2212m\u22121 pm )}, (66)\n\u00d7(qk\u2212m\u22122 qm \u2212\n(2(k \u2212 m) \u2212 2)(2(k \u2212 m) \u2212 1)\n\nfor k = 2, 3, * * * . Thus we conclude that the infinite vibrating string problem is\nthe L-integrable.\nWe must notice that the expression of gk is so complicate that we can't\nclearly find the physical meanings of these first integrals. On the other hand,\nthe physical meaning of the first integral f (y, t) is very clear. Thus, behind\nthose complicate first integrals, perhaps there is a simple rule such that a clear\nphysical picture can be emerged to us.\nRemark 2. It is easy to see that\nZ +\u221e\ngn (t) =\nxn ut (x, t)dx\n(67)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nare first integrals for n = 0, 1, * * * and they constitute a countably infinite set of\nfirst integrals. But this is not a complete set of first integrals.\n\n10\n\n\f6\n\nThe L-integrability of the KdV equation\n\nConsider the following KdV equation\nut \u2212 6uux + uxxx = 0.\n\n(68)\n\nThe corresponding Schrodinger equation is\n\u2212\n\nd2\n\u03c6 + u\u03c6 = k 2 \u03c6.\ndx2\n\n(69)\n\nAs x \u2212\u2192 \u221e for Imk > 0 and u satisfies the KdV equation, we let\na(k) = \u03c6(x, k)eikx ,\n\n(70)\n\nwe have (see Ref.[3] for the details on inverse scattering transformation)\nd\na(k) = 0.\ndt\nLet\nln a(k) =\n\n(71)\n\n+\u221e\n\nZ\n\n\u03c7(x, k)dx.\n\n(72)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThen \u03c7 satisfies the Riccati's equation\n\u03c7x + \u03c72 \u2212 u \u2212 2ik\u03c7 = 0.\n\n(73)\n\nFurthermore, let\n\u03c7=\nwe have\n\nR\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\n\u03c7m\n,\nm\n(2ik)\nm=1\n\n(74)\n\n\u03c72m dx = 0 and an infinite number of first integrals\nZ\nIm = \u03c72m\u22121 dx = 0,\n\n(75)\n\nfor m = 0, 1, * * * . Now we can prove that these first integrals constitute a complete set since we can determine the function a(k) by the values of these first\nintegrals Im for m = 0, 1, * * * . Indeed, if we know the function a(k), we can ob2\n2\ntain the action variables n(k) = 2k\n\u03c0 ln |a(k)| , k > 0 and Nl = kl , k = 1, * * * , N ,\n\u2032\nwhere ikl s are the zeros of a(k). In other words, we can solve out the action\nvariables. We conclude that these first integrals constitute a complete set, that\nis, the KdV equation is the L-integrable. Of course, we can obtain the actionangle variables by solving the Hamilton-Jacobi equation with the Hamiltonian\nrewritten in terms of the action variables\nN\n\nH=\u2212\n\n32 X 5/2\nNl + 8\n5\nl=1\n\n11\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n+\u221e\n\nk 3 n(k)dk.\n\n(76)\n\n\fRemark 3. The L-integrability of other soliton equations such as nonlinear\nSchrodinger equation and Sine-Gordon equation, can be established easily.\nRemark 4. Magri[7] use a Bi-Hamiltonian structures and the infinitesimal\nsymmetry transformation method to study an infinite number of constants of\nmotion. Wadati[8] also use the infinitesimal symmetry transformation method\nto obtain many results about conversation laws of KdV equation. The modern\ndevelopment of Bi-Hamiltonian structures method can be seen Ref.[9] and the\nreferences therein.\nOf course, if an infinite-dimensional Hamilton system can be reformulated\nin terms of action-angle variables, we usually consider it integrable. Here, we\nstrictly prove that this integrability is just the L-integrability. In other words,\nan infinite number of first integrals represented in terms of all action variables\nis a complete set. By theorem 2, we can easily prove the following theorem.\nTheorem 3. For a given Hamilton system, if its all action variables can be\nreconstructed by an infinite number of first integrals, the set of first integrals is\ncomplete, that is, the system is L-integrable.\n\n7\n\nConclusion\n\nWe extend the Hamilton-Jacobi theory and Liouville theorem from the finitedimensional case to the infinite-dimensional case. We introduce the L-integrability\nwhich can be considered as a suitable definition of Liouville integrability in infinite dimension. As examples, we study the string vibration problem in detail,\nand use the Hamilton-Jacobi theory to solve it. We give an infinite number of\nfirst integrals and prove that this is a complete set, that is, the string vibration\nproblem is L-integrable. We also discuss the problem about the uncomplete\nfirst integrals. From our discussion, the physical picture of the L-integrability\nof the string vibration problem is very clear. Finally, we apply our theory\nto the soliton equation and prove that the KdV equation is L-integrable. Of\ncourse, the L-integrability of other nonlinear evolution equations such as nonlinear Schrodinger equation can also be easily obtained.\nAcknowledgments.
