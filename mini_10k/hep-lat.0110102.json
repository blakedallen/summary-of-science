We compare it with direct results and with the\nGlasgow method by using nf =4 QCD at Im(\u03bc)6=0. We locate the critical endpoint (E) of QCD on the Re(\u03bc)-T\nplane. In this study we use nf =2+1 dynamical staggered quarks with semi-realistic masses on Lt = 4 lattices.\n\nI. Introduction.- QCD at finite T and \u03bc is of\nfundamental importance, since it describes relevant features of particle physics in the early universe, in neutron stars and in heavy ion collisions.\nExtensive experimental work has been done with\nheavy ion collisions at CERN and Brookhaven\nto explore the \u03bc-T phase diagram. It is a longstanding non-perturbative question, whether a\ncritical point exists on the \u03bc-T plane, and particularly how to tell its location theoretically [1].\nQCD at finite \u03bc can be formulated on the\nlattice [2]; however, standard Monte-Carlo techniques can not be used. The reason is that for\nRe(\u03bc)6=0 the determinant of the Euclidean Dirac\noperator is complex. This fact spoils any importance sampling method.\nAn attractive approach to alleviate the problem is the \"Glasgow method\" (see e.g. Ref. [3])\nin which the partition function (Z) is expanded\nin powers of exp(\u03bc/T ) by using an ensemble of\nconfigurations weighted by the \u03bc=0 action. After collecting more than 20 million configurations\nonly unphysical results were obtained. The reason is that the \u03bc=0 ensemble does not overlap\nenough with the finite density states of interest.\nA recent review on QCD at finite T-\u03bc is Ref. [4].\nWe propose a method to reduce the overlap\nproblem and determine the phase diagram in the\n\u03bc-T plane (for details see [5]). We also locate\nthe critical point of QCD. (Similar technique was\nsuccessful for determining the endpoint of the hot\nelectroweak plasma [6] e.g. on 4D lattices.)\nII.\nOverlap\nimproving\nmulti-parameter\nreweighting.- Let us study a generic system\nof fermions \u03c8 and bosons \u03c6, where the fermion\nLagrange density is \u03c8\u0304M (\u03c6)\u03c8. Integrating over\n\nthe Grassmann fields we get:\nZ\nZ(\u03b1) = D\u03c6 exp[\u2212Sbos (\u03b1, \u03c6)] det M (\u03c6, \u03b1),\nwhere \u03b1 denotes a set of parameters of the Lagrangian. In the case staggered QCD \u03b1 consists\nof \u03b2, the quark mass (mq ) and \u03bc. For some choice\nof the parameters \u03b1=\u03b10 importance sampling can\nbe done (e.g. for Re(\u03bc)=0). Rewriting the above\nequation one obtains\nZ\nZ(\u03b1) = D\u03c6 exp[\u2212Sbos (\u03b10 , \u03c6)] det M (\u03c6, \u03b10 )\n\u001a\n\u001b\ndet M (\u03c6, \u03b1)\nexp[\u2212Sbos (\u03b1, \u03c6) + Sbos (\u03b10 , \u03c6)]\n.\ndet M (\u03c6, \u03b10 )\nWe treat the curly bracket as an observable \u2013\nwhich is measured on each configuration\u2013 and the\nrest as the measure. It is known that changing\nonly one parameter of the ensemble generated at\n\u03b10 provides an accurate value for some observables only for high statistics. This is ensured\nby rare fluctuations as the mismatched measure\noccasionally sampled the regions where the integrand is large. This is the so-called overlap problem. Having several parameters the set \u03b10 can be\nadjusted to ensure a better overlap than obtained\nby varying only one parameter.\nThe basic idea of the method as applied to dynamical QCD can be summarized as follows. We\nstudy the system at Re(\u03bc)=0 around its transition point. Using a Glasgow-type technique we\ncalculate the determinants for each configuration\nfor a set of \u03bc, which, similarly to the FerrenbergSwendsen method [7], can be used for reweighting. The average plaquette values can be used\n\n\f2\n\nFigure 1. The average of \u03c8\u0304\u03c8 at \u03b2=5.085 as a\nfunction of Im(\u03bc), for direct results (squares; their\nsizes give the errors), our technique (crosses) and\nGlasgow-type reweighting (dots).\n\nto perform an additional reweighting in \u03b2. Since\ntransition configurations were reweighted to transition configurations a much better overlap can\nbe observed than by reweighting pure hadronic\nconfigurations to transition ones as done by the\nGlasgow-type techniques (moving along the transition line was also suggested by Ref. [10]).\nIII. Illustration and direct test.- We have directly tested these ideas in four-flavor QCD with\nmq =0.05 dynamical staggered quarks.\nWe first collected 1200 independent V=4*63\nconfigurations at Re(\u03bc)=Im(\u03bc)=0 and some \u03b2\nvalues and used the Glasgow-reweighting and also\nour technique to study Re(\u03bc)=0, Im(\u03bc)6=0. At\nRe(\u03bc)=0, Im(\u03bc)6=0 direct simulations are possible. After performing these direct simulations as\nwell, a clear comparison can be done. Figure 1\nshows the predictions of the three methods for\nthe average quark condensates at \u03b2=5.085 as a\nfunction of Im(\u03bc). The predictions of our method\nagree with the direct results, whereas for larger\nIm(\u03bc) the predictions of the Glasgow method are\nby several standard deviations off. Based on these\nexperiences we expect that our method can be\nsuccessfully applied at Re(\u03bc)6=0.\nIV. nf 6=4 staggered quarks. - In QCD with\nnf staggered quarks one should change the determinants to their nf /4 power in our two equations.\n\nFigure 2. Im(\u03b20\u221e ) as a function of the chemical\npotential.\n\nImportance sampling works also in this case at\nsome \u03b2 and at Re(\u03bc)=0. Since det M is complex,\none should choose among the Riemann-sheets of\nthe fractional power. We solved this problem analytically [5].\nIn the following we keep \u03bc real and look for the\nzeros of Z on the complex \u03b2 plane. At a first order phase transition the free energy \u221d log Z(\u03b2) is\nnon-analytic. Clearly, a phase transition appears\nonly in the V\u2192 \u221e limit, but not in a finite V .\nNevertheless, Z has zeros at finite V, generating\nthe non-analyticity of the free energy, the LeeYang zeros [8]. These are at complex values of\nthe parameters, in our case at complex \u03b2. For a\nsystem with a first order transition these zeros approach the real axis in the V\u2192 \u221e limit (detailed\nanalysis suggests 1/V scaling). This V\u2192 \u221e limit\ngenerates the non-analyticity of the free energy.\nFor a system with crossover Z is analytic, and the\nzeros do not approach the real axis in the V\u2192 \u221e\nlimit.\nAt T6=0 we used Lt =4, Ls =4,6,8 lattices. T=0\nruns were done on 103 * 16 lattices. mu,d =0.025\nand ms =0.2 were our bare quark masses.\nAt T 6= 0 we determined the complex valued\nLee-Yang zeros, \u03b20 , for different V-s as a function\nof \u03bc. Their V\u2192 \u221e limit was given by a \u03b20 (V ) =\n\u03b20\u221e + \u03b6/V extrapolation. We used 14000, 3600\nand 840 configurations on Ls =4,6 and 8 lattices,\nrespectively. Figure 2 shows Im(\u03b20\u221e ) as a function\nof \u03bc. For small \u03bc-s the extrapolated Im(\u03b20\u221e ) is\n\n\f3\n\nFigure 3.\nThe T-\u03bc diagram. Direct results\nare given with errorbars. Dotted line shows the\ncrossover, solid line the first order transition. The\nbox gives the uncertainties of the endpoint.\n\nWe studied the \u03bc-T phase diagram of QCD\nwith dynamical nf =2+1 quarks. Using our\nmethod we obtained TE =160\u00b13.5 MeV and\n\u03bcE =725\u00b135 MeV for the endpoint. Though \u03bcE\nis too large to be studied at RHIC/LHC, the endpoint would probably move closer to the \u03bc=0 axis\nwhen the quark masses get reduced. At \u03bc=0 we\nobtained Tc =172\u00b13 MeV. Clearly, more work is\nneeded to get the final values. One has to extrapolate to zero step-size in the R-algorithm and to\nthe thermodynamic, chiral and continuum limits.\nThis work was partially supported by Hung.\nSci.\ngrants No.\nOTKA-T34980/T29803/T22929/M28413/OM-MU-708/IKTA111/NIIF.\nThis work was in part based on the MILC collaboration's public lattice gauge theory code:\nhttp://physics.indiana.edu/\u223csg/milc.html.\nREFERENCES\n\ninconsistent with a vanishing value, and predicts\na crossover. Increasing \u03bc the value of Im(\u03b20\u221e )\ndecreases, thus the transition becomes consistent\nwith a first order phase transition. (Note, that\nsystematic overshooting is a finite V effect.) The\nstatistical error was determined by jackknife samples of the total Ls = 4, 6 and 8 ensembles. Our\nprimary result is \u03bcend = 0.375(20).\nTo set the physical \u221a\nscale we used a weighted\naverage of R0 , m\u03c1 and \u03c3. Note, that (including\nsystematics due to finite V) we have (R0 * m\u03c0 ) =\n0.73(6), which is at least twice, mu,d is at least\nfour times as large as the physical values.\nFigure 3 shows the phase diagram in physical\nunits, thus T as a function of \u03bcB , the baryonic\nchemical potential (which is three times larger\nthen the quark chemical potential). The endpoint\nis at TE = 160 \u00b1 3.5 MeV, \u03bcE = 725 \u00b1 35 MeV.\nAt \u03bcB =0 we obtained Tc = 172 \u00b1 3 MeV.\nIV. Conclusions.- We proposed a method \u2013\nan overlap improving multi-parameter reweighting technique\u2013 to numerically study non-zero \u03bc\nand determine the phase diagram in the T -\u03bc\nplane. Our method is applicable to any number\nof Wilson or staggered quarks. As a direct test\nwe showed that for Im(\u03bc)6=0 the predictions of\nour method are in complete agreement with the\ndirect simulations, whereas the Glasgow method\nsuffers from the well-known overlap problem.\n\n1.
