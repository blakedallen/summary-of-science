GAMBURD\n\na fascinating question to determine what happens for a \"typical\" Riemann\nsurface of large genus.\nThe idea of using cubic graphs to study the first eigenvalue of Riemann\nsurfaces originated in the work of Buser [15, 17]. As we discuss in Section 3,\nthe behavior of the first eigenvalue of the discrete Laplacian on a random cubic graph is understood rather well. In [14], Brooks and Makover introduced\nan approach to studying the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian of a \"typical\"\ncompact Riemann surface of large genus based on compactifying finite-area\nRiemann surfaces associated with random cubic graphs with random orientation; we review the Brooks\u2013Makover construction in Section 2. To each\ncubic graph \u0393 with an orientation O, they associate two Riemann surfaces:\nS O (\u0393, O), a finite-area noncompact surface, and S C (\u0393, O), a compact surface. The surface S O (\u0393, O) is an orbifold cover of H/PSL(2, Z) described\nby (\u0393, O) and therefore shares some of the global geometric properties with\nthe graph \u0393. The compact surface S C (\u0393, O) is a conformal compactification\nof S O (\u0393, O); Brooks and Makover proved that almost always the global geometry of S C (\u0393, O) is controlled by the geometry of S O (\u0393, O). Moreover,\naccording to Belyi's theorem [4], the surfaces S C (\u0393, O) are precisely the Riemann surfaces which can be defined over some number field and so form a\n\"dense\" set in the space of all Riemann surfaces.\nThe question as to how these surfaces are distributed in the Teichm\u00fcller\nspaces depends on the study of oriented cycles in random cubic graphs\nwith random orientation; Brooks and Makover conjectured that asymptotically normalized cycle lengths follow Poisson\u2013Dirichlet distribution. We recall the definition of Poisson\u2013Dirichlet distribution [3]. Let B1 , B2 , . . . be\nindependent random variables uniformly distributed on [0, 1]. Define G =\n(G1 , G2 , . . .) as follows:\nG1 = B1 ;\n\nG2 = (1 \u2212 B1 )B2 ;\n\nGi = (1 \u2212 B1 )(1 \u2212 B2 ) * * * (1 \u2212 Bi\u22121 )Bi .\n\nThe random sequence G can be viewed as a description of a random breaking\nof a stick of unit length into an infinite sequence of subintervals. A stick of\nlength B1 is broken off at the left, which leaves a piece of length 1 \u2212 B1 .\nFrom this, a piece of length (1 \u2212 B1 )(1 \u2212 B2 ) is broken off, and so on. G is\na distribution on the set\n\"\n\n\u221e\n\n\u03a9 = x \u2208 R : x1 , x2 , * * * \u2265 0,\n\n\u221e\nX\ni=1\n\n#\n\nxi = 1 .\n\nThe ranked version of G, (G(1) , G(2) , . . .), where G(1) \u2265 G(2) \u2265 . . . , has Poisson\u2013\nDirichlet distribution. If, instead of uniform distribution, Bi has beta-(1, \u03b8)\ndensity \u03b8(1 \u2212 x)\u03b8\u22121 on [0, 1] with \u03b8 > 0, the resulting distribution is called\nPoisson\u2013Dirichlet distribution with parameter \u03b8. Poisson\u2013Dirichlet distribution arises in a great variety of problems; see [3, 42] and references therein. In\n\n\fPOISSON\u2013DIRICHLET DISTRIBUTION FOR RANDOM BELYI SURFACES\n\n3\n\na recent breakthrough work [21], Diaconis, Mayer-Wolf, Zeitouni and Zerner\nproved a conjecture of Vershik [52] asserting that Poisson\u2013Dirichlet distribution is the unique invariant distribution for uniform split-merge transformations.\nAs we discuss in Section 3, the distribution of cycle lengths for random\nregular graphs in any of the standard models is a rather difficult problem;\nadding random orientation, at first, seems only to complicate matters (see\nthe example in Section 2). However, as we explain at the end of Section 3, this\nextra randomness turns out to help us: by giving a permutational model for a\nrandom regular graph with random orientation, we can convert the problem\ninto one involving the symmetric group. More precisely, the distribution\nof oriented cycles in a random k-regular graph on n vertices with random\norientation is the same as the distribution of cycles in the permutation \u03b2\u03b1,\nwhere \u03b2 is chosen uniformly on the conjugacy class consisting of the product\nof k-cycles, and \u03b1 is chosen with uniform probability on the conjugacy class\nconsisting of the product of 2-cycles in the symmetric group SN with N =\nnk. In Section 4, using the Diaconis\u2013Shahshahani upper bound lemma [22],\nthe estimate on the number of rim hook tableaux by Fomin and Lulov [23]\nand representation theory of the symmetric group (in particular, the hook\nlength formula and the Murnaghan\u2013Nakayama rule), we show that as n \u2192 \u221e\nthe distribution of \u03b2\u03b1 converges to uniform distribution. We then invoke\nwhat is perhaps the oldest occurrence of Poisson\u2013Dirichlet distribution-\nthe distribution of normalized cycle lengths for a random permutation in Sn\nas n tends to infinity [49, 57, 58]-to prove the conjecture of Brooks and\nMakover.\nIt turns out that the number of oriented cycles in random cubic graphs\nwith random orientation was also studied by Pippenger and Schleich [43]\nin connection with topological characteristics of random surfaces generated\nby cubic interactions. The surfaces considered by Pippenger and Schleich\nare obtained by taking 3n arcs of an even number of oriented triangles\nand randomly identifying them in pairs respecting the orientation; these\nsurfaces arise in various contexts in two-dimensional quantum gravity and as\nworld sheets in string theory. Random cubic graphs with random orientation\nprovide an alternative way of constructing the surfaces in [43]. Denoting by\nl(n) the number of oriented cycles in a random cubic graph on n vertices with\na random orientation, Pippenger and Schleich proved that E(l(n)) = log n +\nO(1) and Var(l(n)) = O(log n). Further, based on empirical study of 10,000\nrandom surfaces, each constructed from 80,000 triangles, they conjectured\nthat\n(1.1)\n\nE(l(n)) = log(3n) + \u03b3 + o(1)\n\nand\n(1.2)\n\nVar(l(n)) = log(3n) + \u03b3 \u2212 \u03c0 2 /6 + o(1),\n\n\f4\n\nA. GAMBURD\n\nwhere \u03b3 = 0.5772 . . . is Euler's constant. It was pointed out by Nicholas\nPippenger that (1.1) and (1.2) follow from the main theorem of this paper\nand a priori bounds on the first few moments of l(n) obtained by the methods\nof [43]. Another consequence of the main theorem (Corollary 5.2) is that\nthe expected area of the largest embedded ball in a random Belyi surface\nconverges to 0.62\n2\u03c0 of the total surface area. We conclude Section 5 by briefly\ndiscussing the conjectured Tracy\u2013Widom distribution for the second largest\neigenvalue of random regular graphs; we hope that our results will be useful\nin approaching this fascinating open problem.\n2. Belyi surfaces. In [4], Belyi proved a remarkable result asserting that a\nRiemann surface S can be defined over the field of algebraic numbers Q if and\nonly if there exists a covering f : S \u2192 C unramified outside {0, 1, \u221e}. We call\nsuch surfaces Belyi surfaces. In this section we review the Brooks\u2013Makover\nconstruction of Belyi surfaces from cubic graphs. We remark that Mulase\nand Penakava [38] have given a very interesting alternative construction of\nBelyi surfaces; in their construction, the edges of the graphs are allowed to\nhave variable lengths.\nLet \u0393 be a cubic graph. An orientation O on the graph \u0393 is an assignment\nfor each vertex v of \u0393 of a cyclic ordering of the half-edges incident to\nthat vertex. Given a cubic graph on n vertices, it will have 2n different\norientations. A left-hand-turn path (LHT path) on \u0393 is a closed path on \u0393\nsuch that, at each vertex, the path turns left in the orientation O.\nGiven a pair (\u0393, O), we construct a finite-area Riemann surface S O (\u0393, O)\nas follows. We take the ideal hyperbolic triangle T with vertices 0, 1 and\n\nFig. 1.\n\nThe marked ideal triangle T .\n\n\fPOISSON\u2013DIRICHLET DISTRIBUTION FOR RANDOM BELYI SURFACES\n\n5\n\n\u221e shown in Figure 1. The solid lines in\u221aFigure 1 are geodesics joining the\n1+i 3\npoints i, i + 1 and i+1\n2 with the point\n2 , while the dotted lines are horocycles joining pairs of points from the set {i, i + 1, i+1\n2 }. We may think of\nthese points as \"midpoints\" of the corresponding sides of the ideal triangles,\neven though the sides are of infinite length. We may also think of the three\nsolid lines as edges of a graph emanating from a vertex. We may then give\nthem the cyclic ordering (i, i + 1, i+1\n2 ). Given a cubic graph \u0393 with an oriO\nentation O, we construct S (\u0393, O) by associating to each vertex an ideal\ntriangle, and gluing neighboring triangles. We glue two copies of T along\nthe corresponding sides, subject to the following two conditions:\n(a) the \"midpoints\" of the two sides are glued together,\nand\n(b) the gluing preserves the orientation of the two copies of T .\nThe conditions (a) and (b) determine the gluing uniquely. It is easily seen\nthat the surface S O (\u0393, O) is a complete Riemann surface with a finite area\nequal to \u03c0n, where n is the number of vertices of \u0393.\nIt is easy to see that the horocycle pieces on each T glue together to\ngive closed horocycles about a cusp of S O (\u0393, O). The length of each closed\nhorocycle is precisely the length of corresponding LHT path. The surface\nS C (\u0393, O) is the conformal compactification of S O (\u0393, O). The oriented graph\n(\u0393, O) describes S O (\u0393, O) as a covering space of H2 /PSL2 (Z), with each\nvertex being an orbifold point of order 3.\nWe are now ready to state the following result, whose proof was sketched\nby Brooks and Makover in [14]:\nLemma 2.1.\ncubic graph \u0393.\n\nS is a Belyi surface if and only if S = S C (\u0393, O) for some\n\nProof. We first show that if G is a torsion-free finite index subgroup\nof PSL2 (Z), then H2 /G = S C (\u0393, O) for some cubic graph \u0393. Indeed, we can\ntake as a fundamental domain for PSL2 (Z) a set F = {0 < R(z) < 1, |z| >\n1, |z \u22121| > 1}. Three copies of F fit together to give a marked ideal triangle as\npresented in Figure 1; they are transformed by means of an elliptic element\nw of order 3 in PSL2 (Z).\nNow since G is torsion free, F , w(F ) and w2 (F ) are not equivalent under\nG, and so they can all be included in the fundamental domain of G. In\nparticular, there is a fundamental domain of G such that consisting of the\ncopies of ideal triangle T . The graph dual to this triangulation, together with\nthe boundary pairings and orientation of H2 /G, is exactly the pair (\u0393, O).\nNow since S is a Belyi surface if and only if one can find finitely many\npoints {p1 , . . . , pl } on S such that S \u2212 {p1 , . . . , pl } is isomorphic to H2 /G,\n\n\f6\n\nA. GAMBURD\n\nwhere G is a torsion-free finite index subgroup of PSL2 (Z) [31], the lemma\nis proved. \u0003\nWe define probability on the space of oriented graphs with n-vertices\n(\u0393n , O) as follows. We pick a random cubic graph with n vertices using the\nBollobas model, described in the next section, then we pick an orientation O\nwith equal probability from all 2n possible orientations on the given graph.\nIf Q is a property of graphs, we denote by Probn [Q] the probability that\nan oriented graph (\u0393n , O) picked from our probability space has property\nQ. Brooks and Makover proved [14] the following result on Belyi surfaces\nconstructed from random cubic graphs with random orientation:\nTheorem 2.1.\nthat, as n \u2192 \u221e:\n\nThere exist positive constants C1 , C2 , C3 and C4 such\n\n(a) The first eigenvalue \u03bb1 (S C (\u0393, O)) satisfies\nProbn [\u03bb1 (S C (\u0393, O)) \u2265 C1 ] \u2192 1.\n\n(b) The Cheeger constant h(S C (\u0393, O)) satisfies\nProbn [h(S C (\u0393, O)) \u2265 C2 ] \u2192 1.\n(c) The shortest geodesic syst(S C (\u0393, O)) satisfies\nProbn [syst(S C (\u0393, O)) \u2265 C3 ] \u2192 1.\n(d) The diameter diam(S C (\u0393, O)) satisfies\nProbn [diam(S C (\u0393, O)) \u2264 C4 log(genus(S C (\u0393, O)))] \u2192 1.\nThe theorem is proved, roughly, as follows. First, one establishes that,\nwith probability tending to 1 as n \u2192 \u221e, a property in question holds for\nrandom cubic graphs [see Section 3 for results pertaining to parts (a) and\n(b)]. Then, using the fact that (\u0393, O) describes S O (\u0393, O) as an orbifold covering, one transfers this information to open surfaces S O (\u0393, O), using the\nresults of Brooks in [8, 9]. One then transfers the desired property to the surfaces S C (\u0393, O) by using the Ahlfors\u2013Schwarz\u2013Wolpert lemma as developed\nby Brooks in [10, 11] and extended by Brooks and Makover in [12, 13, 14].\nThe topology of the surface can be read off from (\u0393, O), using LHT paths.\nIn particular, the genus is given by Euler's formula; as is customary when\nusing Euler's formula, we refer to an LHT path as a face of the oriented\ngraph.\nLet n be the number of vertices of \u0393 and let l(\u0393, O) be the number of\ndisjoint left-hand-turn paths. For a cubic graph, the number of edges is\n\n\fPOISSON\u2013DIRICHLET DISTRIBUTION FOR RANDOM BELYI SURFACES\n\nFig. 2.\n\n7\n\nChanging orientation on the cube.\n\nE(\u0393) = 3n\n2 and the number of faces is F = l(\u0393, O). Therefore, by Euler's\nformula, we have:\nn \u2212 2l\n.\n4\nAccording to Euler's formula, in order to find the genus of a surface constructed from a cubic graph with n-vertices, we need to estimate the number\nof faces (i.e., left-hand-turn paths). As explained in [14], the length of the\nlargest LHT path L also determines the area of the largest embedded ball.\nAs we discuss in Section 3, computing the distribution of closed paths in\nrandom regular graphs is a very difficult problem. An additional complication is that left-hand-turn paths are not necessarily simple closed paths on\nthe graph, but can self-intersect in a very complex pattern. We would like to\niliustrate these complications with the simple example of the 1-skeleton of\nthe cube, with the usual orientation (Figure 2A). We have F = 6, and all the\nfaces are simple paths of the graph, therefore the genus is 0. In Figure 2B\nwe changed the orientation of the upper right vertex. With the new orientation, the three simple faces that were previously adjacent to the upper right\nvertex are now joined to one composite face, while the other three faces are\nunchanged, hence F = 4, and the surface has genus 1.\n(2.1)\n\ngenus(S C (\u0393n , O)) = genus(S O (\u0393n , O)) = 1 +\n\n3. Random regular graphs. In this section we briefly review the pertinent facts on random k-regular graphs; see Wormald's paper [59] for an\nexcellent survey. Given a k-regular graph G and a subset X of V , the expansion of X, c(X), is defined to be the ratio |\u2202(X)|/|X|, where \u2202(X) = {y \u2208\nG : distance(y, X) = 1}. The expansion coefficient of a graph G is an analogue\n\n\f8\n\nA.

For a k-regular graph, the adjacency\nmatrix is related to the combinatorial Laplacian \u2206 by A = kI \u2212 \u2206. Using the\ndiscrete Cheeger\u2013Buser inequality, condition (5.1) can be rewritten in terms\nof the second largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix A(G) as follows:\n(3.3)\n\nlim sup \u03bb2 (An,k ) < k.\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nIn 1973, Pinsker [41] observed that a random regular graph is a good\nexpander. This corresponds to the following fact about random matrices: a\nrandom symmetric matrix of size N with k ones in each row and column\nand all other entries zero has its biggest eigenvalue equal to k, but its next\neigenvalue will be bounded away from k by a fixed amount independent of N .\nThe result of Pinsker on expansion coefficients of random regular graphs was\nconsiderably strengthened by Bollob\u00e1s [7], who also introduced a widely used\nconfiguration model for random regular graphs [6]. In this model, random\nk-regular graphs on N vertices\nare represented as the images of so-called\nS\nconfigurations. Let W = nj=1 Wj be a fixed set of 2m = nd vertices, where\n|Wj | = d. A configuration F is a partition of W into m pairs of vertices\ncalled edges of F .

Given a configuration F , let \u03c6(F ) be the graph with vertex set\nV = 1, . . . , n in which ij is an edge iff F has a pair with one end in Wi\nand the other in Wj .

Let Xi denote the number of closed walks of length\ni in G \u2208 Gn,k . Then, for i = o(logk\u22121 n) as n \u2192 \u221e, random variables Xi\n\nconverge to independent Poisson random variables with mean\n\n(k\u22121)i\n2i .\n\nCounting cycles of length greater than log n is substantially more difficult. In a recent breakthrough work [25], following his earlier work in [24],\nFriedman estimates the number of cycles of length O(log2 n) and uses this\nestimate (among other things) to prove that k-regular graphs on n vertices\nGn,k are asymptotically\nRamanujan: for k fixed and \u03b5 > 0, the probability\n\u221a\nthat \u03bb1 (Xn,k ) \u2264 2 \u221ak \u2212 1 + \u03b5 tends to 1 as n \u2192 \u221e.\nThe bound of 2 k \u2212 1 is optimal in view of the result of Alon\u2013Boppana\n[1, 35]. We also mention an early result of McKay [37], who showed that\nspectral density of random k-regular\u221agraphs converges\nto Kesten's measure,\n\u221a\nthat is, a measure supported on [\u22122 k \u2212 1, 2 k \u2212 1 ] and given by\n(3.6)\n\nk\n\u03bdk =\n2\u03c0\n\np\n\n4(k \u2212 1) \u2212 t2\n.\nk 2 \u2212 t2\n\nWe now introduce the permutational model for random regular graphs\nwith random orientation. Consider a neighborhood of a vertex of a cubic\ngraph. It contains three half-edges incident to it. Denote the set of all halfedges by H; |H| = 2|E| = 3|V |. Now the cyclic ordering of half-edges at each\nvertex is specified by a 3-cycle, and a collection of all cyclic orders on the\nhalf-edges yields a permutation of H consisting of the product of 3-cycles.\nThe structure of the underlying graph is given by the way half-edges couple\nto each other to form an edge; this is described by a permutation all of whose\ncycles are of order 2.\nIn the Figure 3 we have\n\u03b2 = (1, 3, 5)(2, 12, 8)(4, 7, 9)(6, 10, 11),\n\u03b1 = (1, 2)(3, 4)(5, 6)(7, 8)(9, 10)(11, 12)\nand\n\u03c6 = \u03b2\u03b1 = (1, 12, 6)(2, 3, 7)(4, 5, 10)(8, 9, 11).\nLet G \u2208 Gn,k be a k-regular graph on n vertices; let O be its orientation,\nthat is, a cyclic ordering of incident half-edges for each vertex. Associated\nwith a (G, O), we have a pair of permutations (\u03b2, \u03b1) in SN , where N = kn,\nwith cycles of \u03b2 encoding the information about the vertices with their cyclic\n\n\f10\n\nA. GAMBURD\n\norientation and \u03b1 encoding the information about the edges. The cycles of\n\u03c6 = \u03b2\u03b1 encode the information about the faces.\nNow the problem of the distribution of the lengths of LHT paths can be\ngiven the following, equivalent, formulation. Denote by Cr the conjugacy\nclass of AN consisting of the product of N/r disjoint r-cycles. Choose \u03b2\nwith uniform probability on Ck and choose \u03b1 with uniform probability on\nC2 . Then the distribution of LHT paths in a random k-regular graph on n\nvertices with random orientation is the same as the distribution of cycles in\nthe permutation \u03b2\u03b1.\n4. Proof of Brooks\u2013Makover conjecture. This section is devoted to the\nproof of the following result:\nTheorem 4.1.

The distribution of LHT paths for random regular\ngraphs with random orientation converges to Poisson\u2013Dirichlet distribution;\nin particular, the Brooks\u2013Makover conjecture is true.\nProof. Let \u03c0 denote the cycle type of a permutation; denote by C S (\u03c0)\nthe number of permutations with a given cycle type \u03c0 in the symmetric\ngroup SN and by C A (\u03c0) the number of permutations with cycle type \u03c0 in\nthe alternating group AN .

Consequently, the proofs of the asymptotic Poisson\u2013\nDirichlet distribution for normalized cycle lengths in the symmetric group\napply also in the case of alternating group. The proof of the corollary is\ncompleted by applying Theorem 4.1 and the triangle inequality. \u0003\n(4.4)\n\nC A (\u03c0) =\n\nWe now turn to the proof of Theorem 4.1. The basic tool is the following\nresult, known as the Diaconis\u2013Shahshahani upper bound lemma; see [19, 20]\nfor a survey of applications and ramifications:\nProposition 4.1 ([22]). Let G be a finite group and denote by \u011c the set\nof irreducible unitary representations of G. Let P be a probability measure\non G and denote by P\u0302 (\u03c1) its Fourier transform at the representation \u03c1 \u2208 \u011c.\nLet U be uniform probability measure on G.

Representations of the symmetric group SN are labeled by partitions \u03bb \u22a2 N . A partition \u03bb of a nonnegative\ninteger N is a sequence\n(\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbr ) \u2208 Nr satisfying\nP\nP\n\u03bb1 \u2265 * * * \u2265 \u03bbr and \u03bbi = N . We call |\u03bb| = \u03bbi the size of \u03bb. The number\nof parts of \u03bb is the length of \u03bb, denoted l(\u03bb). We write mi = mi (\u03bb) for the\nnumber of parts of \u03bb that are equal to i, so we have \u03bb = h1m1 2m2 . . .i.\nThe Young diagram of a partition \u03bb is defined as the set of points (i, j) \u2208\nZ2 such that 1 \u2264 i \u2264 \u03bbj ; it is often convenient to replace the set of points\nabove by squares. The conjugate partition \u03bb\u2032 of \u03bb is defined by the condition\nthat the Young diagram of \u03bb\u2032 is the transpose of the Young diagram of \u03bb;\nequivalently mi (\u03bb\u2032 ) = \u03bbi \u2212 \u03bbi+1 .\nA standard Young tableau (SYT) of shape \u03bb is a filling of the boxes of\n\u03bb with positive integers 1, . . . , N such that the rows and the columns are\nstrictly increasing.\nIn Figure 4 we exhibit a partition \u03bb = (5, 5, 3, 2) = h10 21 31 52 i and an\nSYT T of shape \u03bb.\nWe denote by f \u03bb the dimension of representation of SN indexed by \u03bb; it is\nequal to the number of standard Young tableaux of shape \u03bb [30]. We denote\nby \u03c7\u03bb (\u03bc) the value of the character indexed by \u03bb on the conjugacy class\n\n\fPOISSON\u2013DIRICHLET DISTRIBUTION FOR RANDOM BELYI SURFACES 13\n\nC\u03bc . For example, for the conjugacy class Ck , the corresponding partition is\n\u03bc = kn .\nThe partition \u03bb is called self-associated if its Young diagram is symmetric\nwith respect to the main diagonal, equivalently if \u03bb = \u03bb\u2032 . Now for an irreducible representation of SN indexed by \u03bb which is not self-associated, the\nrestriction of \u03bb to AN is irreducible ([30], page 67). If \u03bb is self-associated\nthen restriction to AN splits into two irreducible representations, \u03bb+ and\n\u03bb\u2212 . The character values of the irreducible representations \u03bb+ and \u03bb\u2212 can\nbe expressed in terms of character values of \u03c7\u03bb (\u03bc); for the conjugacy class \u03bc\nnot equal to the set of main diagonal hooks of \u03bb (see the definition of hook\n\u03bb\nbelow), it is given by \u03c7 2(\u03bc) . All irreducible representations of AN are obtained from the irreducible representations of SN in this way. Consequently,\nwe obtain the following lemma:\nLemma 4.1.\n(4.7)\n\nNotation being as above, we have\n\nX \u0012 \u03c7\u03c1 (Ck )\u03c7\u03c1 (C2 ) \u00132\n\nc\n\u03c1\u2208A\nN\n\u03c16=id\n\n\u22642\n\ndim(\u03c1)\n\nX\n\n\u0012\n\nc\n\u03bb\u2208S\nN\n\u03bb6=hN i,h1N i\n\n\u03c7\u03bb (Ck )\u03c7\u03bb (C2 )\nf\u03bb\n\n\u00132\n\n.\n\nProof.

Given a diagram \u03bb and a square u = (i, j) \u2208 \u03bb, a hook\nwith vertex u is a set of squares in \u03bb directly to the right or directly below\nu. We define hook length (also referred to as hook number ) h(u) of \u03bb at u by\nh(u) = \u03bbi + \u03bb\u2032j \u2212 i \u2212 j \u2212 1.\nEquivalently, h(u) is the number of squares directly to the right or directly\nbelow u, counting u itself once.

Extensive information is available on the distribution of cycles in\nrandom permutations and on Poisson\u2013Dirichlet distribution [3, 42] and we\nwill pursue the exhaustive exploitation of the consequences of Theorem 4.1\nin a subsequent publication. Here we note just two immediate corollaries\nwhich substantially refine results in [14, 28, 43].\nCorollary 5.1. Let l(n) denote the number of LHT paths in a random\ncubic graph on n vertices with random orientation. Then, as n \u2192 \u221e,\nE(l(n)) = log(3n) + \u03b3 + o(1),\n\n(5.1)\n\nVar(l(n)) = log(3n) + \u03b3 \u2212 \u03c0 2 /6 + o(1),\n\n(5.2)\n\nn\n\u221a\nwhere \u03b3 = 0.5772 . . . is Euler 's constant. Further, l(n)\u2212log\nconverges to stanlog n\n\ndard normal distribution N (0,\u221a\n1). From (2.1) we obtain that the genus is\nn\ndistributed as 1 + 4 \u2212 N (log n, log n ).\nLet L(n) be the length of the largest LHT path. Then\n\nCorollary 5.2.\n(5.3)\n\nlim E\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nL(n)\n=\nn\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n\u0012\n\nexp \u2212x \u2212\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nx\n\n\u0013\n\n(e\u2212y /y) dy dx \u223c 0.6243.\n\nConsequently, the expected area of the largest embedded ball in S C (\u0393, O)\nconverges to 0.62\n2\u03c0 of the total surface area.\nThe expression on the right-hand side of (5.3) is due to Shepp and Lloyd\n[49], who also computed the limiting distribution of L.\n\n\f20\n\nA. GAMBURD\n\n5.2. Recent numerical experiments of Novikoff [39] present convincing\nevidence in favor of the following conjecture (see [27] for a discussion of\nrelated conjectures and numerical results):\nConjecture 5.1 ([39]). The distribution of the second largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a random regular graph, suitably rescaled,\nfollows Tracy\u2013Widom GOE distribution.\nTracy and Widom [53, 54] computed the limiting distribution function for\nthe largest eigenvalue in the classical Gaussian ensembles; these distribution\nfunctions are expressed in terms of a certain Painlev\u00e9 II function and are now\nbelieved to describe new universal limit laws for a wide variety of processes\narising in mathematical physics and interacting particle systems [55].\nA dramatic consequence of Conjecture 5.1 would be that the probability of\na random regular graph being Ramanujan approaches 0.52 as the size of the\ngraph tends to infinity, corresponding to the skewness in the Tracy\u2013Widom\nGOE distribution.\nTo approach Conjecture 5.1 following the method Sinai and Soshnikov\n[50] and Soshnikov [51] in his breakthrough proof of the universality at the\nedge of the spectrum in Wigner matrices, one needs precise information for\nthe number of closed walks of size up to n2/3 , where n is the size of the\ngraph. We hope that the results of this paper will be useful in pursuing such\nan approach.\nAcknowledgments. I started working on this problem while visiting Bob\nBrooks at the Technion in August 2001; I would like to thank the Department of Mathematics at Technion for its hospitality. The interplay between\nspectral geometry of surfaces and graphs, particularly the issue of the first\neigenvalue, has been a recurrent theme in Bob's work; his papers, written\nwith deep sympathy for the reader, and his continuing support and encouragement have been very important to me. The results presented in this paper\nwere obtained in the spring of 2002 and I communicated them to Bob a few\nmonths before his untimely death in September 2002. I lectured on them\nin June 2002 at the spectral geometry conference in Lexington, Kentucky\nand at the Brooks Memorial Conference in Technion in December 2003; I\nwould like to thank the organizers of these conferences. After my talk at the\nBrooks Memorial Conference, Alex Lubotzky told me that Martin Liebeck\nand Aner Shalev independently obtained a result similar to Proposition 4.2;\nI would like to thank Aner Shalev for sending me their preprint [33].
