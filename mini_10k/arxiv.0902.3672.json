The spectrum of shrapnel B is well-represented by a singletemperature thin-thermal plasma in a non-equilibrium ionization state. The elemental abundances of\nO, Ne, and Mg are found to be significantly higher than the solar values, supporting that shrapnel B\noriginates from supernova ejecta. The abundances of O, Ne, and Mg relative to Fe are enhanced above\ntheir solar values, while that of Si relative to Fe are at their solar values. This abundance pattern is\nsimilar to that in shrapnel D, except that the enhancements of the lighter elements are less prominent,\nsuggesting more extensive mixing with the interstellar medium (ISM) in shrapnel B. The contribution\nof the ISM is considered to be larger at the trailing region, because the absolute abundances of some\nelements there are depleted relative to those at the shrapnel's head.\nSubject headings: ISM: individual (Vela SNR) - supernova remnants - X-rays: ISM\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nSupernova (SN) explosions are prominent phenomena\nthrough which heavy elements are released into interstellar space. The ejected materials often constitute fragments, or ejecta knots, although their creation mechanism has not been well-understood. In fact, such fragments of ejecta have been discovered from several supernova remnants (SNRs): e.g., Tycho (Decourchelle et al.\n2001), Cas A (Laming & Hwang 2003; Fesen et al. 2006),\nPup A (Winkler & Kirshner 1985; Katsuda et al. 2008),\nand G292.0+1.8 (Park et al. 2007). As mentioned below,\nthe Vela SNR is also one of the most interesting SNRs\nfrom which some candidates of ejecta fragments can be\nobserved.\nThe Vela SNR is considered to be the remnant of a\nType II-P SN explosion of the progenitor star with the\nmass of < 25M\u2299 (Gvaramadze 1999). The age of the\nSNR has been estimated to be \u223c 1.1 \u00d7 104 yr from the\nspin down rate of PSR B0833\u201345 (the Vela pulsar: Taylor et al. 1993), which is associated with the SNR (e.g.,\nWeiler & Sramek 1988). Since this SNR has the largest\nangular size (\u223c 8\u25e6 : Aschenbach et al. 1995; Lu & Aschenbach 2000) among observable SNRs, it is a very ideal\ntarget for studying the detailed structure of an old SNR.\nAschenbach et al. (1995) observed the entire Vela SNR\nin the ROSAT all-sky survey, and discovered six isolated\nfragment-like features, named \"shrapnels\" A to F, which\nhave overrun the primary blast wave shock boundary.\nThe opening angles of the shrapnels' bow-shock features\nsuggest them to be supersonically moving in tenuous ambient matter. The symmetry axis of each shrapnel traces\nback to the center of the SNR, which is very close to\nthe Vela pulsar. Such a configuration suggests that the\nElectronic address: hiroya@crab.riken.jp\n1 RIKEN (The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research), 21 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan\n2 Department of Earth and Space Science, Osaka University, 1-1\nMachikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 560-0043, Japan\n3 NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771,\nUSA\n\nshrapnels are associated with the fossil material of the SN\nexplosion; they had probably traveled behind the blast\nwave for a long time and passed its front at the late stage\nwhen the blast wave had decelerated. If they are really\nthe clumps of the SN ejecta, it is expected that the chemical compositions of the shrapnels are abundant in heavy\nelements. Therefore, some of the shrapnels have been\nstudied to reveal the metal abundances using several recent X-ray missions.\nShrapnel A is the most well-investigated one. Tsunemi\net al. (1999a) observed the shrapnel with ASCA, and\nfound a strong Si K-shell emission line with relatively\nweak emission from other elements. Then, the Chandra and XMM-Newton observations confirmed that the\nshrapnel is significantly over-abundant in Si, while the\nother elements, i.e., O, Ne, Mg, and Fe, have solar or\nsub-solar abundances (Miyata et al. 2001; Katsuda &\nTsunemi 2006: hereafter KT06). They thus concluded\nthat shrapnel A originated from a deep (Si-rich) layer of\nthe progenitor star. The relative abundances among the\nheavy elements were found to be almost uniform in the\nentire shrapnel.\nOn the other hand, the ASCA spectra of shrapnel D, which is the brightest and largest among the\nsix shrapnels, indicated over-abundances of O, Ne, and\nMg (Tsunemi et al. 1999b). Using XMM-Newton, Katsuda & Tsunemi (2005; hereafter KT05) confirmed that\nthe abundance ratios of O-Ne-Mg to Fe are significantly\nlarger than solar, which is consistent with the view that\nthis shrapnel is a fragment of the ejecta from a shallow\nlayer of the progenitor.\nInterestingly, several bright ejecta knots have been discovered in the northern part of the Vela SNR by the\nrecent XMM-Newton observations (Miceli et al. 2008).\nThey suggested that these knots would be \"new\" shrapnels hidden inside the Vela main shell by the projection\neffect. The relative abundances of these knots were found\nto be quite similar to those observed in shrapnel D; O,\nNe, and Mg were much more abundant than those of the\nother elements.\n\n\f2\n\nYamaguchi and Katsuda\n\nFig. 1.- Surface brightness map of Vela shrapnel B in the 0.5\u2013\n1.3 keV band obtained with ROSAT PSPC. North is up and east\nis to the left. The scale is logarithmic. The field of view of the XIS\nis shown by a gray solid square.\n\nShrapnel B is another candidate of the ejecta fragment discovered with ROSAT all-sky survey, and the\nsecond brightest next to shrapnel D (Aschenbach et al.\n1995). Although it was observed with ASCA, the elemental abundances could not be determined due to the\npoor photon statistics (Tsunemi et al. 1999b). In this paper, therefore, we investigate the chemical and physical\nproperties of shrapnel B, by analyzing high quality spectral data obtained with Suzaku. In \u00a72, we introduce the\nobservation and data reduction procedure. The results\nof our analysis are presented in \u00a73. Finally, we develop\nthe discussion and summarize our findings in \u00a74 and \u00a75,\nrespectively. We assume the distance to the Vela SNR to\nbe 250 pc, following Cha et al. (1999). The errors quoted\nin the text and tables are at the 90% confidence level, and\nthe error bars in the figures are for 1\u03c3 confidence, unless\notherwise noted.\n2. OBSERVATION AND DATA REDUCTION\n\nThe 0.5\u20131.3 keV ROSAT PSPC image of shrapnel B\n(Figure 1) shows a clear bow shock structure. A part of\nVela shrapnel B was observed by Suzaku on 2006 November 5\u20137 (Observation ID = 501085010). The field of view\n(FOV) of the observation is shown in the image of the\nentire region of shrapnel B.\nIn this paper, we concentrate on the data obtained\nwith the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS: Koyama et\nal. 2007) on board Suzaku. The XIS consists of four Xray charge coupled devices (CCD) at the foci of the four\nX-Ray Telescopes (XRT; Serlemitsos et al. 2007). All\nfour XRTs are co-aligned to image the same region of\nthe sky. The half-power diameter (HPD) of the XRT\nis \u223c 2\u2032 , independent of the X-ray energy. Three of the\nCCDs (XIS0, 2, and 3) are Front-Illuminated (FI) sensors\nand the fourth (XIS1) is Back-Illuminated (BI). The latter has superior sensitivity in the 0.2\u20131.0 keV band with\na significantly improved energy resolution compared to\nprevious X-ray CCD cameras.\nThe XIS were operated in the normal full-frame clocking mode with spaced-row charge injection (SCI) technique (Uchiyama et al. 2008). For the following data re-\n\nFig. 2.- Suzaku XIS image of Vela shrapnel B in the 0.5\u20132.0 keV\nband, with J2000.0 coordinates. The data from the XIS0, 1, and 3\nare combined. The vignetting effect is corrected after subtraction of\nthe non X-ray background. The image is smoothed with a Gaussian\nkernel of \u03c3 = 33\u2032\u2032 and shown on a linear scale. The field of view of\nthe XIS is indicated by the black square. The source regions used\nfor the spectral analyses are shown by the solid lines.\n\nduction, the HEADAS software of version 6.5 was used.\nWe employed the revision 2.0 data products, but reprocessed the data using the xispi software and the makepi\nfiles of 20080905. These files include the latest calibration results for the charge transfer inefficiency (CTI) and\ngain. We cleaned the reprocessed data following the standard screening criteria4 and obtained an effective exposure time of \u223c58 ksec. Although all four sensors were\nactive at the time of the observation, the XIS2 became\ninoperable soon after the use of the SCI technique. The\nenergy scale of the XIS2 for the SCI-on mode was therefore not well calibrated (Uchiyama et al. 2008) and we do\nnot use the data obtained by the XIS2 in the subsequent\nanalysis.\n3. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS\n3.1. Image\n\nFigure 2 shows the XIS image in the 0.5\u20132.0 keV band.\nNo significant diffuse emission is found above 2 keV,\nwhich suggests that the shrapnel is dominated by soft Xrays. An image of the non X-ray background (NXB) in\nthe same energy band was obtained using the xisnxbgen\nsoftware and subtracted from the raw image. The NXB\ndata were constructed from the night-Earth database by\nsorting on the geomagnetic cut-off rigidity. The NXBsubtracted image was then divided by the exposure map\nconstructed with the xissim software to correct for vignetting.\nIn this image, we can see the clear ridge structure of\nthe shrapnel. The diffuse emission is the brightest at\nthe center of the FOV and extends to the northwest and\nsoutheast. It is also extended to the opposite side of the\nrim (toward the main shell of the Vela SNR), although its\n4\n\nhttp://heasarc.nasa.gov/docs/suzaku/processing/criteria xis.html\n\n\fVela Shrapnel B\n\n3\n\nsurface brightness there is lower than in the other regions.\nSimilar trailing features are found in shrapnels A and D\n(Miyata et al. 2001; KT05; KT06).\n3.2. Spectrum\n\nFor a quantitative study of the physical properties,\nwe extracted the XIS spectra from several regions indicated with solid lines in Figure 2-hereafter, \"Head\",\n\"Tail\", \"NW\", and \"SE\". We analyzed the spectra using XSPEC version 11.3.2, with the response matrix files\n(RMF) and ancillary response files (ARF) made using\nwith the xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen software.\n3.2.1. Background subtraction\n\nAlthough there is a source-free region at the east edge\nof the FOV, it is too small to obtain a background spectrum with sufficient photon statistics. Therefore, we used\n\"blank sky\" data to estimate the background emission.\nThe most suitable blank sky observation for our data is\nthe offset observation for RX J0852\u20134622 (Obs. date =\n2005 December 23, Obs. ID = 500010020), whose aim\npoint (RA, Dec) = (9h 00m31s , \u201343\u25e6 28\u2032 36\u2032\u2032 ) is only \u223c 4.4\ndegrees from Vela shrapnel B. We applied the same datascreening criteria as we did for the shrapnel B data, obtaining an exposure time of \u223c 59 ksec. To minimize\nthe uncertainty due to the background subtraction, the\nbackground spectra were taken from the same detector\ncoordinates as the source regions.\nIt is known that the energy resolution of the XIS is\ngradually degrading due to radiation damage while in orbit (Koyama et al. 2007). Also, the efficiency for the detection of soft X-rays has decreased because of the buildup of the contaminating material on the optical blocking filters (OBF) of the XIS due to out-gassing from the\nsatellite. Since these effects vary with the time, we examined the differences in the XIS performance for the shrapnel B and blank sky observations. We found that the\ndifference in energy resolution is negligible, at \u223c 60 eV\nand \u223c 55 eV (FWHM) at 0.5 keV for the shrapnel B\nand blank sky data, respectively. On the other hand, the\ncolumn density of the accumulated contaminant (at the\ncenter of the CCDs) during each observation shows some\ndifferences as shown in Table 1. For the XIS0 and 1,\nthe extinction column densities at the time of the source\nobservation are twice as large as those for the blank sky,\nso there should be taken properly into account. We thus\napplied the following procedure before the background\nsubtraction: (1) The NXB data from the same detector regions were subtracted from both of the source and\nblank sky spectra. (2) The NXB-subtracted spectra of\nthe blank sky were corrected by multiplying the ratios\nbetween the efficiencies during the source and blank sky\nobservations. For example, we show in Figure 3 the result for the Head region. The black and gray data points\nwith filled squares are the NXB-subtracted XIS1 spectra\nfrom the source and blank sky data, respectively. After\nthe efficiency correction, the blank sky spectrum is given\nas the gray crosses with open circles. The count rate of\nthe soft X-rays (below \u223c 0.6 keV) was significantly reduced, while that of the hard X-rays was not changed\nmuch.\nThe background-subtracted spectrum of each region\nwas obtained as shown in Figure 4. Several K-shell emission line blends, including OVII (\u223c 0.57 keV), OVIII\n\nFig. 3.- Comparison of the source and background spectra.\nBlack with filled squares represents the XIS1 spectrum of Head region with the non X-ray background subtracted.

The absorption column density (NH ), electron temperature (kTe ), and emission measure (EM)\nwere treated as free parameters. The elemental abundances relative to the solar values (Anders & Grevesse\n1989) of O, Ne, Mg, Si, and Fe were also allowed to\nvary freely. The abundances of S and Ni were linked to\nthose of Si and Fe respectively, while those of the other\nelements were fixed to the solar values. Since the absolute gain of the XIS has a small uncertainty of \u00b15 eV\n(Koyama et al. 2007; Uchiyama et al. 2008), we allowed\nfor a small offset in the photon-energy to the pulse-height\ngain relationship. With this model, we obtained a bestfit with kTe = 0.26 \u00b1 0.01 keV and \u03c72 /d.o.f. = 428/319.\nAlthough the spectra were relatively well reproduced\nby the CIE model, we also fitted a non-equilibrium\nionization plasma model (VNEI with NEIvers 2.0:\nBorkowski et al. 2001). The ionization timescale (ne t),\nwhere ne and t are electron density and the time since\nthe plasma was heated, was an additional free parameter\nin these models. Given that the value of \u03c72 /d.o.f. was\nsignificantly reduced to 370/318 (F-test probability was\n\n\f4\n\nYamaguchi and Katsuda\n\nFig. 4.- Background-subtracted XIS spectrum of each region.

The best-fit parameters\nand model are given in Table 2, and Figure 4 (top left),\nrespectively. A relatively large disagreement between the\ndata and model was found around 1.2 keV, which can be\nattributed to Fe-L emission lines missing in the plasma\ncode (e.g., Brickhouse et al. 2000). The above fitting process required a gain offset of 4.4 eV only for the XIS1,\nwhich is within the allowable range. Although we also\ntried to fit the spectra by fixing the abundances of C and\nN to that of O, the result did not change significantly.\nThe Ne and Mg abundances are enhanced by a factor of\na few above the solar values. Although it is less prominent, the O is also over-abundant than the solar at a 3\u03c3\n\nconfidence level.\n3.2.3. Tail, NW, and SE regions\n\nWe next analyzed the spectra of the Tail region using\nthe same model and assumption as for the Head region.\nWe found that the best-fit result required a low interstellar absorption of NH < 8.0 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 (the best-fit\nvalue was pegged at zero). This may be due to incomplete calibration information for the contamination layer\non the OBF at the large off-axis angle region (Koyama et\nal. 2007). We thus fixed the column density to the bestfit value of the Head region (NH = 1.3 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 ) and\nfitted again. We obtained an acceptable result (\u03c72 /d.o.f.\n= 208/168) as given in Table 2.

The solar abundance ratios are shown by\nthe dashed lines.\n\nparameter values are fully consistent with those derived\nfor the case of NH was freely fitted. The elemental abundances of the Tail region are found to be significantly\nlower than those of the Head region, except for Si. If we\nfit the Tail spectrum fixing the abundances to the best-fit\nvalues for the Head region given in Table 2, the fit was\nstatistically worse (\u03c72 /d.o.f. = 270/173) based on an Ftest (probability of \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u22128 ), and thus was rejected.\nWe therefore conclude that the abundances of some elements at the Tail region are really depleted relative to\nthose at the Head region.\nThe spectra of the NW and SE regions were also fitted\nwith the NH fixed. The best-fit parameters (listed in Table 2) were found to be consistent with those of the Head\nregion, so that the elemental abundances are consistent\nwith the values for the Head. Freely fitting the NH did\nnot change these results, although the best-fit NH values\nwere unreasonably low probably due to the same reason\nseen in the Tail spectrum.\n4. DISCUSSION\n4.1. Chemical Composition\n\nWe have measured enhanced abundances of the heavy\nelements in Vela shrapnel B, for the first time, strongly\nsupporting that shrapnel B is an ejecta fragment (originating from the explosion of the Vela SN), similar to\nshrapnels A and D (KT05; KT06). We note, however,\nthat it is difficult to determine the absolute values of the\nelemental abundances, because the bremsstrahlung asso-\n\nciated with high-Z ions contributes significantly to the\ncontinuum emission. Indeed, if we fix the O abundance\nto be 10 times solar and fit the Head spectrum, we obtain\nan acceptable \u03c72 /d.o.f. value of 409/319.\nThe derived relative abundances among the heavy elements are much more reliable, since they are mainly determined from the intensity ratios of the emission lines.\nFigure 5 shows the confidence contours for the abundances of O, Ne, Mg, and Si against that of Fe, derived\nfrom the spectrum of the Head region. We can see that\nthe abundance ratios of Ne/Fe and Mg/Fe are enhanced\nover the solar values. Furthermore, the O/Fe ratio is\nalso higher than unity at > 99% confidence. These results match the nucleosynthesis yields of core-collapse\nSNe (e.g., Thielemann et al. 1996) rather than thermonuclear Type Ia SNe (e.g., Iwamoto et al. 1999). The obtained relative abundances (with 90% error) for the Head\nregion are listed in Table 3, along with those for shrapnels A and D (KT05; KT06), for comparison. Shrapnel A\nis obviously dominated by Si, while shrapnel D is abundant in O, Ne, and Mg, which are synthesized exterior\nto the Si-rich layer of the progenitor. The abundance\npattern of shrapnel B is relatively similar to those found\nin shrapnel D, except that the over-abundances of the\nlighter elements are less prominent. This suggests more\nsignificant mixing with the interstellar medium (ISM) in\nshrapnel B than in shrapnel D. The same interpretation\nhas been advanced argued for some ejecta knots discovered around the northeast rim of the Vela SNR (Miceli\net al. 2008) that have abundance patterns very similar\n\n\f6\n\nYamaguchi and Katsuda\nTABLE 3\nAbundance ratios of Vela shrapnels.a\nO/Fe\nNe/Fe\nMg/Fe\nSi/Fe\n\nShrapnel Bb\n1.2 (1.1\u20131.3)\n3.1 (2.8\u20133.5)\n2.1 (1.7\u20132.4)\n1.1 (0.4\u20131.8)\n\nShrapnel Ac\n0.4\n1.1\n1.0\n3.8\n\nShrapnel Dd\n4.6\n9.8\n10\n0.7\n\na Abundance ratios are shown in terms of the solar values from\nAnders & Grevesse (1989).\nb The values for the Head region.\nc Katsuda & Tsunemi (2006).\nd Katsuda & Tsunemi (2005); Note that the Si abundance is assumed to be solar.\n\nto those of shrapnel B.\nWe find that the absolute abundances of O, Ne, and\nMg in the Tail region are significantly lower than those\nin the Head and the other regions. This suggests that\nthe contribution of the ISM is larger at the Tail region\nthan elsewhere. Note that the FOV of the Suzaku observation covers a very limited portion of the shrapnel (see\nFigure 1). In order to investigate the more detailed spatial distribution of the elemental abundances, we need to\nobserve a larger area of shrapnel B. This will help us to\nseparate the ejecta and ISM components more clearly.\n4.2. Plasma Properties\n\nThe spectra from all the regions are found to be reproduced well by a NEI plasma model with a single electron temperature of kTe \u223c 0.6 keV. The obtained ne t\nvalue is on the order of 1010 cm\u22123 s, which indicates\nthat the plasma is far from CIE. The ROSAT study\nshowed that the electron temperature of shrapnel B was\nkTe = 0.39 \u00b1 0.12 keV (Aschenbach et al. 1995), which is\nsignificantly lower than our result. The ASCA study also\nderived a lower temperature of kTe = 0.33 \u00b1 0.01 keV\n(Tsunemi et al. 1999b). These inconsistencies probably arise because the previous studies applied the CIE\nplasma model. Indeed, we obtain a similarly low temperature from the Suzaku spectrum using CIE models\n(see \u00a73.2.2). The sum of the luminosities of the four regions is LX \u223c 3.4\u00d71031 ergs s\u22121 in the 0.2\u20132.0 keV band.\nThe ROSAT PSPC image (Figure 1) shows that the flux\nin the XIS FOV is \u223c 25% of that of the entire shrapnel\nso that the total luminosity of shrapnel B is estimated to\nbe LX \u223c 1.3 \u00d7 1032 ergs s\u22121 .\nAssuming an axially symmetric structure for the shrapnel, the emission depth of the plasma is roughly estimated to be 8 \u00d7 1018 cm at a distance of 250 pc. Therefore, using the best-fit elemental abundances given in Table 2, the EM of the Head and Tail regions correspond\nto the proton densities of 0.06 cm\u22123 and 0.05 cm\u22123 , respectively. (A homogeneous density distribution is also\nassumed here.) These values are lower than the typical density of shrapnel D (\u223c 0.2 cm\u22123 : KT05), which is\ngenerally consistent with our interpretation that shrapnel B is more significantly mixed with the ISM than is\nshrapnel D. For the Head region, the plasma mass is estimated to be 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u2299 , while the mass of the heavy\nelements is 5.2 \u00d7 10\u22125 M\u2299 . Assuming a volume for the\n\nentire shrapnel of 5 \u00d7 1056 cm3 and a uniform density of\n0.05 cm\u22123 , the total mass in shrapnel B is \u223c 0.02 M\u2299 .\nThis is comparable to that of shrapnel A (Tsunemi et\nal. 1999a; KT06), although shrapnel B's angular size is\nmuch larger. We note, however, that the plasma mass\ndepends on the absolute abundances of heavy elements,\nwhich are difficult to determine the metal-rich plasma\nsuch as those in the Head region (as mentioned in \u00a74.1).\nIf we assume that the plasma is composed purely of metals (without H and He), the mass of the Head region\ndecreases to 3.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 M\u2299 .\nFor shrapnels A and D, the electron temperatures were\nfound to decrease gradually toward the trailing regions\nof the fragments (KT05; 06). If the shrapnels are simply\nbreakout features out of the blast wave, the temperature\nobserved is expected to increase toward the center of the\nexplosion. Therefore, KT06 argued that the higher temperature at the head regions supports the ejecta origin\nof the shrapnels. However, we do not find any significant\ntemperature variation between the Head and Tail regions\nof shrapnel B. Follow-up observations of this shrapnel\nwith a deep exposure and a large FOV are required to\nconclusively reveal the kTe distribution.\n5. SUMMARY\n\nWe have analyzed Suzaku data of Vela shrapnel B. Utilizing the good sensitivity and spectroscopic performance\nof the XIS, we clearly detect several emission line blends\nfrom highly ionized heavy elements. The spectrum of the\nHead region is well fitted with an NEI plasma with an\nelectron temperature of kTe \u223c 0.6 keV. The abundances\nof some heavy elements are found to be significantly enhanced above the solar values. This result strongly suggests that shrapnel B originates from the ejecta of the\nVela SN. The abundances of O, Ne, and Mg relative to\nFe are higher than the solar ratios. Shrapnel B can therefore be identified with the outer layer of the progenitor,\nsimilar to shrapnel D. However, the over-abundances of\nthe lighter elements are less prominent than for shrapnel D, indicating that shrapnel B has been mixed with\na larger mass of ISM than shrapnel D. The spectrum\nfrom the Tail region is reproduced by a similar model\nas the Head region, but with significantly lower absolute\nabundances of O, Ne, and Mg. This indicates a relatively\nlarge contribution from swept-up ISM for the Tail region.\nNo significant temperature variation between the Head\nand the Tail regions is found. The total luminosity (in\n0.2\u20132.0 keV band) and mass of the entire shrapnel are estimated to be LX \u223c 1.3 \u00d7 1032 ergs s\u22121 , and \u223c 0.02 M\u2299 ,\nrespectively.\nThe authors deeply appreciate helpful comments on revising the manuscript from Dr. Una Hwang.
