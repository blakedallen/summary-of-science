Mitigating the\nrisk by partial disconnection endangers their functionality. Here we propose a systematic strategy of\nselecting a minimum number of autonomous nodes that guarantee a smooth transition in robustness.\nOur method which is based on betweenness is tested on various examples including the famous 2003\nelectrical blackout of Italy. We show that, with this strategy, the necessary number of autonomous\nnodes can be reduced by a factor of five compared to a random choice. We also find that the\ntransition to abrupt collapse follows tricritical scaling characterized by a set of exponents which is\nindependent on the protection strategy.\nPACS numbers: 89.75.Hc, 64.60.ah, 89.75.Da, 89.75.Fb\n\nInterconnected complex networks are ubiquitous in todays world. They control infrastructures of modern society (energy-communication-transportation), the financial system or even the human body [1\u20133]. Unfortunately,\nthey are much more fragile than uncoupled networks as\nrecently recognized through the finding that the robustness changes from a second order transition in uncoupled\nsystems to first order in interdependent systems [4\u20136].\nThe obvious mitigation strategy consists in partially decoupling the networks by the creation of autonomous\nnodes [7]. Too much disconnection however risks endangering the functionality of the system. The question\nwhich we will address here is how to reduce fragility without losing functionality and we will in fact answer this\nquestion by developing an explicit algorithm based on betweenness that enables to avoid the abrupt collapse with\na minimum number of autonomous nodes.\nBuldyrev et al. [4] proposed a percolation framework\nto study two coupled networks, A and B, where each Anode is coupled to a B-node, via bi-directional links, such\nthat when one fails the other cannot function either. The\nremoval of a fraction of A-nodes may trigger a domino effect where, not only their counterparts in B fail, but all\nnodes that become disconnected from the giant cluster\nof both networks also fail. This causes further cascading\nof failures, yielding an abrupt collapse of connectivity,\ncharacterized by a discontinuous (first order) percolation\ntransition. Parshani et al. [7] showed that damage can be\nmitigated by decreasing the degree of coupling, but only\nif a significant fraction (\u2248 0.4) of nodes is decoupled,\nthe transition changes from discontinuous to continuous.\nThe coupling is reduced by randomly selecting a fraction\nof nodes to become autonomous and, therefore, indepen-\n\n\u2217\n\nCorrespondence and requests for materials should be addressed\nto N. A. M. A. (nuno@ethz.ch)\n\nFigure 1. The herein proposed strategy improves significantly the resilience of the coupling between the communication system (39 stars) and the power grid (310 circles) in Italy.\nThe color scheme stands for the probability that the node is\ninactive after the random failure of 14 communication servers.\nIn a) all communication servers are coupled while in b) four\nservers have been decoupled following the strategy proposed\nhere. The coupling between the networks was established\nbased on the geographical location of the nodes, such that\neach communication server is coupled with the closest power\nstation [2]. The images were produced using the software Pajek.\n\ndent on the other network. For the coupling between\npower stations and communication servers, for example,\nautonomous power stations have alternative communication systems which are used when the server fails and\nan autonomous server has its own energy power supply.\nWe propose a method, based on degree and centrality, to\nidentify these autonomous nodes that maximize the robustness of the system in terms of connectivity. We show\nthat, with this scheme, the critical coupling increases,\ni.e., the fraction of nodes that needs to be decoupled to\nsmoothen out the transition is much smaller (close to 0.1\n\n\f2\nposed [10] to quantify the robustness R as\nR=\n\nN\n1 X\nS(Q) ,\nN\n\n(1)\n\nQ=1\n\nwhere Q is the number of node failures, S(Q) the size of\nthe largest connected cluster in a network after Q failures,\nand N is the total number of nodes in the network [10,\n11]. Here we extend this definition to coupled systems\nby performing the same measurement, given by Eq. (1),\nonly on the network where the random failures occur,\nnamely, network A. To follow the cascade triggered by\nthe failure of a fraction 1 \u2212 p of A-nodes, similar to [7],\nwe solve the iterative equations,\n\u03b2n = 1 \u2212 q\u03b2,n [1 \u2212 SA (\u03b1n ) p] ,\n\u03b1n = p (1 \u2212 q\u03b1,n [1 \u2212 SB (\u03b2n\u22121 )]) ,\n\nFigure 2. Scheme of the cascade of node failures triggered by\nthe initial failure of a node in network A (top network). Two\nnetworks, A (top) and B (bottom), are considered. When a\nnode initially fails in network A (a) all nodes connected to\nthe largest component through it also fail (b) as well as the\ncorresponding dependent nodes in network B (c). The failure\nof the dependent nodes in network B leads to further failures\nin both networks (d) and (e). For each iteration step, the\ndegree of coupling qx and the size of the largest connected\ncomponent Sx for each network x are listed in (f).\n\ncompared to 0.4). Significant improvement is observed\nfor different coupled networks including for Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi\ngraphs (ER) where such improvement in the robustness\nwas unexpected given their narrow degree distribution.\nTo demonstrate the strength of our approach, in Fig. 1\nwe apply the proposed strategy to the real coupled system in Italy [2] and show that by only protecting four\nservers the robustness is significantly improved (details\nin the figure caption).\nWe consider a pair of networks, A and B, where a\nfraction q (degree of coupling) of A-nodes are coupled\nwith B-nodes. To be functional, nodes need to be connected to the giant cluster of their network. When an\nA-node fails, the corresponding one in B cannot function\neither. Consequently, all nodes bridged to the largest\ncluster through these nodes, together with their counterpart in the other network, become also deactivated.\nA cascade of failures occurs with drastic effects on the\nglobal connectivity (see Fig. 2) [4, 7]. This process can\nalso be treated as an epidemic spreading [8]. To study\nthe resilience to failures, we follow the size of the largest\nconnected cluster of active A-nodes, under a sequence of\nrandom irreversible attacks to network A. Notwithstanding the simplicity of solely considering random attacks,\nthis model can be straightforwardly extended to targeted\nones [9]. Recently, for single networks, it has been pro-\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nwith the initial condition \u03b11 = p, where \u03b1n and \u03b2n are\nthe fraction of A and B surviving nodes at iteration step\nn and Sx (\u03c7n ) is the fraction of such nodes in the giant\ncluster. q\u03c7,n is the fraction of dependent nodes in network \u03c7 fragmented from the largest cluster (see Methods\nfor further details).\n\nRESULTS\n\nTo demonstrate our method of selecting autonomous\nnodes we consider two ER graphs with average degree\nhki = 4 and 10% of autonomous nodes (q = 0.1). First\nwe consider a method based on the degree of the node\nand later we compare with the method based on the betweenness. Under a sequence of random failures, the networks are catastrophically fragmented when close to 45%\nof the nodes fail, as seen in Fig. 3. For a single ER, with\nthe same average degree, the global connectivity is only\nlost after the failure of 75% of the nodes. Figure 3 also\nshows ((green-)dotted-dashed line) the results for choosing as autonomous nodes in both networks the fraction\n1 \u2212 q of the nodes with the highest degree and coupling\nthe remaining ones at random. With this strategy, the\nrobustness R can be improved and the corresponding increase of pc is about 40%, from close to 0.45 to close to\n0.65. Also the order of the transition changes from first\nto second order. Further improvement can be achieved\nif additionally the coupled nodes are paired according to\ntheir position in the ranking of degree, since interconnecting similar nodes increases the global robustness [12, 13].\nIn the inset of Fig. 3 we see the dependence on q of the\nrelative robustness for the degree strategy compared to\nthe random case R/Rrandom . For the entire range of q\nthe proposed strategy is more efficient and a relative improvement of more than 15% is observed when still 85%\nof the nodes are coupled.\nTwo types of technological challenges are at hand: either a system has to be designed robust from scratch\nor it already exists, constrained to a certain topology,\n\n\f3\n\nFigure 3.\nFraction of A-nodes in the largest connected\ncluster, s, as a function of the fraction of randomly removed\nnodes 1 \u2212 p from network A, for two coupled ER (average\ndegree hki = 4) with 90% of the nodes connected by internetwork links (q = 0.9). It is seen that robustness can significantly be improved by properly selecting the autonomous\nnodes. We start with two fully interconnected ER and decouple 10% of their nodes according to three strategies: randomly\n((black-)solid line), the ones with highest degree in network A\n((red-)dotted line) and in network B ((blue-)dashed line). We\nalso include the case where 10% autonomous nodes in both\nnetworks are chosen as the ones with highest degree and all the\nothers are interconnected randomly ((green-)dotted-dashed\nline). The inset shows the dependence of the relative robustness of the degree strategy on the degree of coupling q\ncompared with the random case. Results for the degree have\nbeen obtained with the formalism of generation functions (see\nMethods).\n\nbut requires improved robustness. In the former case,\nthe best procedure is to choose as autonomous the nodes\nwith highest degree in each network and couple the others based on their rank of degree. For the latter, rewiring\nis usually a time-consuming and expensive process, and\nthe creation of new autonomous nodes may be economically more feasible. The simplest procedure consists in\nchoosing as autonomous both nodes connected by the\nsame inter-network link. However, a high degree node in\nnetwork A is not necessarily connected with a high degree node in network B. In Fig. 3 we compare between\nchoosing the autonomous pairs based on the degree of\nthe node in network A or in network B. When pairs of\nnodes are picked based on their rank in the network under the initial failure (network A), the robustness almost\ndoes not improve compared to choosing randomly. If, on\nthe other hand, network B is considered, the robustness\nis significantly improved, revealing that this scheme is\nmore efficient. This asymmetry between A and B network is due to the fact that we attack only nodes in\nnetwork A, triggering the cascade, that initially shuts\ndown the corresponding B-node. The degree of this Bnode is related to the number of nodes which become disconnected from the main cluster and consequently affect\nback the network A. Therefore, the control of the degree\nof vulnerable B-nodes is a key mechanism to downsize\nthe cascade. On the other hand, when a hub is pro-\n\nFigure 4. Dependence of the robustness, R, on the degree of\ncoupling, q, for two, interconnected, (a) ER (average degree\nhki = 4) and (b) SF with degree exponent \u03b3 = 2.5. Applying\nour proposed strategy is applied, the optimal fraction of autonomous nodes is relatively very small. Autonomous nodes\nare chosen in four different ways: randomly ((blue-)triangles),\nhigh degree ((black-)dots), high betweenness ((red-)stars),\nand high k-shell ((yellow-)rhombi). The insets show the relative improvement of the robustness, for the different strategies of autonomous selection compared with the random case.\nResults have been averaged over 102 configurations of two\nnetworks with 103 nodes each. For each configuration we averaged over 103 sequences of random attacks.\n\ntected in network A it can still be attacked since the\ninitial attack does not distinguish between autonomous\nand non-autonomous nodes.\nIn Fig. 4(a) we compare four different criteria to select\nthe autonomous nodes: betweenness, degree, k-shell, and\nrandom choice, for two coupled ER networks. In the betweenness strategy, the selected autonomous are the ones\nwith highest betweenness. The betweenness is defined as\nthe number of shortest paths between all pairs of nodes\npassing through the node [14]. A k-shell is obtained by\nremoving, iteratively, all nodes with degree smaller than\nk, until all remaining nodes have degree k or larger. In\nthe k-shell strategy, the autonomous are chosen as the\nones with highest k-shell in the k-shell decomposition\n[15]. The coupled nodes (not autonomous), for all cases,\nhave been randomly inter-linked. Since ER networks are\ncharacterized by a small number of k-shells, this strategy\nis even less efficient than the random strategy for some\nvalues of q, while the improved robustness for degree and\nbetweenness strategies is evident compared with the random selection. While in the random case, for q & 0.4,\na significant decrease of the robustness with q is observed, in the degree and betweenness cases, the change\nis smoother and only significantly drops for higher val-\n\n\f4\n\nFigure 5.

The modular networks were\nobtained from four Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi networks, with 500 nodes\neach and average degree five, by randomly connecting each\npair of modules with an additional link. Autonomous nodes\nare selected in three different ways: randomly (blue triangles), higher degree (black dots), and higher betweenness (red\nstars).

Results have been\naveraged over 102 configurations and 103 sequences of random\nattacks to each one.\n\nues of q. A maximum in the ratio R/Rrandom occurs for\nq \u2248 0.85, where the relative improvement is above 12%.\nSince, in random networks, many metrics are strongly\ncorrelated [14], the results for betweenness and degree\nare similar.\nMany real-world systems are characterized by a degree\ndistribution which is scale free with a degree exponent\n\u03b3 [16, 17]. In Fig. 4(b) we plot R as a function of q for\ntwo coupled scale-free networks (SF) with 103 nodes each\nand \u03b3 = 2.5. Similar to the two coupled ER, this system\nis also significantly more resilient when the autonomous\nnodes are selected according to the highest degree or betweenness. For values of q . 0.85 the robustness is similar to that of a single network (q = 0) since the most relevant nodes are decoupled. A peak in the relative robustness, R/Rrandom (see inset of Fig. 4b), occurs for q \u2248 0.95\nwhere the improvement, compared to the random case,\nis almost 30%. Betweenness, degree, and k-shell, have\nsimilar impact on the robustness since these three properties are strongly correlated for SF. From Fig. 4, we see\nthat, for both SF and ER, the robustness is significantly\nimproved by decoupling, based on the betweenness, less\nthan 15% of the nodes. Studying the dependence of the\nrobustness on the average degree of the nodes we conclude that for average degree larger than five, even 5%\nautonomous nodes are enough to achieve more than 50%\nof the maximum possible improvement.\nFor the cases discussed in Fig. 4, results obtained by selecting autonomous nodes based on the highest degree do\nnot significantly differ from the ones based on the highest betweenness. This is due to the well known finding\nthat for Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi and scale-free networks, the degree\n\nFigure 6.\nDependence of the robustness, R, on the degree of coupling, q, for two, randomly interconnected random\nregular graphs with 8 * 103 nodes each, all with degree four.\nAutonomous nodes are selected in two different ways: randomly (blue triangles) and higher betweenness (red stars).

Results\nhave been averaged over 102 configurations and 103 sequences\nof random attacks to each one.\n\nof a node is strongly correlated with its betweenness [14].\nHowever, many real networks are modular, i.e., composed\nof several different modules interconnected by less links,\nand then nodes with higher betweenness are not, necessarily, the ones with the largest degree [18]. Modularity\ncan be found, for example, in metabolic systems, neural\nnetworks, social networks, or infrastructures [19\u201322]. In\nFig. 5 we plot the robustness for two coupled modular\nnetworks. Each modular network was generated from a\nset of four Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi networks, of 500 nodes each and\naverage degree five, where an additional link was randomly included between each pair of modules. For a modular network, the nodes with higher betweenness are not\nnecessarily the high-degree nodes but the ones bridging\nthe different modules. Figure 5 shows that the strategy\nbased on the betweenness emerges as better compared to\nthe high degree method.\nAnother example that shows that betweenness is superior to degree is when we study coupled random regular graphs. In random regular graphs all nodes have\nthe same degree and are connected randomly. Figure 6\nshows the dependence of the robustness on the degree of\ncoupling, for two interconnected random regular graphs\nwith degree 4. The autonomous nodes are selected randomly (since all degrees are the same) or following the\nbetweenness strategy. Though all nodes have the same\ndegree and the betweenness distribution is narrow, selecting autonomous nodes based on the betweenness is\nalways more efficient than the random selection. Thus,\nthe above two examples suggest that betweenness is a superior method to chose the autonomous nodes compared\nto degree.\nThe vulnerability is strongly related to the degree of\ncoupling q. Parshani et al. [7] have analytically and numerically shown that, for random coupling, at a critical\ncoupling q = qt , the transition changes from continuous\n(for q < qt ) to discontinuous (for q > qt ). In Fig. 7 we see\n\n\f5\n\nFigure 7.\nTwo-parameter diagram (blue curves) of two\ncoupled ER (average degree hki = 4) under random attack.\nThe horizontal axis is the degree of coupling q and the vertical\none is p so that 1\u2212p is the fraction of initially removed nodes.\nThe size of the jump in the fraction of A-nodes in the largest\nconnected cluster is also included (red-dotted-dashed curve).\nThe dashed curve stands for a discontinuous transition while\nthe solid one is a critical line (continuous transition).

As seen in Fig. 7, when autonomous nodes\nare randomly selected, about 40% autonomous nodes are\nrequired to soften the transition and avoid catastrophic\ncascades, while following the strategy proposed here only\na relatively small amount (q > 0.9) of autonomous nodes\nare needed to avoid a discontinuous collapse. Above the\ntricritical point, the jump increases with the degree of\ncoupling, lending arguments to the paramount necessity\nof an efficient strategy for autonomous selection, given\nthat the fraction of nodes which can be decoupled is typi-\n\nFigure 9.\nDependence of the fraction of A-nodes in the\nlargest connected cluster on the scaling field \u03bcp along the\ndirection perpendicular to the transition line at the tricritical\npoint.

Autonomous nodes in the two coupled ER\n(hki = 4) have been selected randomly (red line) and following\nthe ranking of degree (black line).\n\ncally limited. The dependence of qt on the average degree\nhki is shown in Fig. 8. The ratio between the tricritical\ncoupling for degree and random strategies increases with\ndecreasing hki. For example, for hki \u2248 2 the fraction of\nautonomous nodes needed to soften the transition with\nthe random selection is six times the one for the degree\nstrategy.\nAs in Ref. [23], following the theory of Riedel and Wegner [24\u201326], we can characterize the tricritical point. Two\nrelevant scaling fields are defined: one tangent (\u03bcp ) and\nthe other perpendicular (\u03bcq ) to the critical curve at the\ntricritical point. In these coordinate axes the continu1/\u03c6\nous line is described by \u03bcp \u223c \u03bcq t , where the tricritical\ncrossover exponent \u03c6t = 1.00 \u00b1 0.05 for degree and random strategies. The tricritical order parameter exponent,\n\u03b2t , can be evaluated from,\ns (\u03bcp , \u03bcq = 0) \u223c \u03bc\u03b2p t ,\n\n(4)\n\ngiving \u03b2t = 0.5 \u00b1 0.1 for both strategies. Since these two\nexponents are strategy independent (see Fig. 9), we conjecture that the tricritical point for degree and random\nselection are in the same universality class.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nHere, we propose a method to chose the autonomous\nnodes in order to optimize the robustness of coupled networks to failures. We find the betweenness and the degree\nto be the key parameters for the selection of such nodes\nand we disclose the former as the most effective for modular networks. Considering the real case of the Italian\ncommunication network coupled with the power grid, we\nshow in Fig. 1 that protecting only the four communication servers with highest betweenness reduces the chances\nof catastrophic failures like that witnessed during the\nblackout in 2003. When this strategy is implemented the\n\n\f6\nresilience to random failures or attacks is significantly improved and the fraction of autonomous nodes necessary\nto change the nature of the percolation transition, from\ndiscontinuous to continuous, is significantly reduced. We\nalso show that, even for networks with a narrow distribution of node degree like Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graphs, the robustness can be significantly improved by properly choosing\na small fraction of nodes to be autonomous. As a followup it would be interesting to understand how correlation\nbetween nodes, as well as dynamic processes on the network, can influence the selection of autonomous nodes.\nBesides, the cascade phenomena and the mitigation of\nvulnerabilities on regular lattices and geographically embedded networks are still open questions. It is important\nto note that while we use here high betweenness and high\ndegree as a criterion for autonomous nodes, it is possible that other metrics will be also useful. For example,\nthe eigenvector component of the largest eigenvector of\nthe adjacency matrix (even weighted) makes a very good\ncandidate (see e.g. [28]).\nMETHODS\n\nWe consider two coupled networks, A and B, where a\nfraction of 1\u2212p A-nodes fails. The cascade of failures can\nbe described by the iterative equations, Eqs. (2) [4, 7],\nwhere \u03b1n and \u03b2n are, respectively, the fraction of A and\nB surviving nodes at iteration step n (not necessarily\nin the largest component), and Sx (\u03c7n ) (\u03c7 = \u03b1|\u03b2, x =\nA|B) is the fraction of nodes in the largest component in\nnetwork x given that 1 \u2212 \u03c7 nodes have failed. This can\nbe calculated for coupled networks in the thermodynamic\nlimit (N \u2192 \u221e) using generating functions.\nRandom Protection\n\nAs proposed by Parshani et al. [7], when autonomous\nnodes are randomly selected and the degree of coupling\nis the same in A and B, the set of Eqs. (2) simplifies to\n\u03b11 = p,\n\u03b2n = 1 \u2212 q [1 \u2212 SA (\u03b1n )p] ,\n\u03b1n = p (1 \u2212 q [1 \u2212 SB (\u03b2n\u22121 )]) ,\n\nand ux satisfies the transcendental equation\nux =\n\nG0Px (1 \u2212 \u03c7(1 \u2212 ux ))\n.\nG0Px (1)\n\nG0Px (y)\n= GPx (y).\nG0Px (1)\nWith the above equations one can calculate the size of\nthe largest component in both networks at the end of the\ncascade process.\nRecently, Son et al. [8] proposed an equivalent scheme\nbased on epidemic spreading to solve the random protection case.\n\nHigh Degree Protection\n\nWhen autonomous nodes are selected following the\ndegree strategy, the fraction of dependent nodes qxn\nchanges with the iteration step n and the set of Eqs. 2\nno longer simplifies. We divide the discussion below\ninto three different parts: the degree distribution, the\nlargest component, and the coupling (fraction of dependent nodes).\n\nThe Degree Distribution\n\nThe networks A and B are characterized by their degree distributions, PA (k) and PB (k), which are not necessarily the same. The developed formalism applies to\nany arbitrary degree distribution. We start by first splitting the degree distribution into two parts, the component corresponding to the low-degree dependent nodes,\nPxD (k), and the component corresponding to the highdegree autonomous ones, PxI (k). To accomplish this, one\nmust determine two parameters, the maximum degree of\ndependent nodes, kxm , and the fraction of nodes with degree kxm that are coupled with the other network, fxm .\nThese two parameters can be obtained from the relations,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere q is the degree of coupling. The degree distribution of the networks does not change in the case\nof random failures and Sx (\u03c7n ) can be calculated as\nSx (\u03c7) = 1 \u2212 GPx (1 \u2212 \u03c7(1 \u2212 ux )) [27], where GPx (z) is\nthe generating function of the degree distribution of network x,\nX\nGPx (z) =\nPx (k)z k ,\nk\n\nThe size of the largest component in network x is given\nby \u03c7Sx (\u03c7).\nFor ER networks GPx (y) = exp [hkix (z \u2212 1)], where\nhkix is the average number of links in network x, and\ntherefore\n\nkxm\nX\u22121\nk=0\n\nPx (k) < q <\n\nk\nxm\nX\n\nPx (k)\n\nk=0\n\nand\nkxm\nX\u22121\n\nPx (k) + fxm Px (kxm ) = q,\n\nk=0\n\nwhere qx is the initial degree of coupling. One can then\nwrite\n\uf8f1\nk < kxm\n\uf8f2 Px (k),\nPxD (k) = fxm Px (k), k = kxm\n(6)\n\uf8f3 0,\nk > kxm\n\n\f7\nwhere \u03c4xn satisfies the self consistent equation\n\nand\n\uf8f1\nk < kxm\n\uf8f2 0,\nPxI (k) = (1 \u2212 fxm )Px (k), k = kxm .\n\uf8f3 P (k),\nk > kxm\nx\n\n\u03c4xn =\n\nG0Pxn\n(1 \u2212 pxn + pxn \u03c4xn )\n0\nG0Pxn\n0 (1)\n\n(7)\n\nIn the model, a fraction of 1 \u2212 p A-nodes are randomly removed. If, at iteration step n, \u03b1n nodes survive\n(\u03b1n \u2264 p), p(1 \u2212 qA ) nodes are necessarily autonomous\nand the remaining ones, \u03b1n \u2212 p(1 \u2212 qA ), are dependent\nnodes. One can then show that the degree distribution\n0\nof network A, under the failure of 1 \u2212 \u03b1n nodes, PA,n\n(k),\nis given by\n\nP\n=\n\nk\u22121\n\nk\n\n0\nkPxn\n(k) (1 \u2212 pxn + pxn \u03c4xn )\nP\n0\nk kPxn (k)\n\n.\n\nThe coupling\n\nTo calculate the fraction q\u03b1,n (and q\u03b2,n ) one must\nfirst calculate the degree distribution of the nodes in the\nlargest component. This is given by\nk\n\n0\nPA,n\n(k) =\n\n1\u2212\n\np\n\u03b1n (1\n\n\u2212 q)\n\n!\nPAD (k) +\n\nq\n\np\nPAI (k),\n\u03b1n\n\nwhile the fraction of surviving links is\n\n1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 pxn + pxn \u03c4xn )\n.\nS\u03c7n x (\u03c7n )\nThe fraction of nodes in the largest component that are\nautonomous is then given by\n0\nPxG,n (k) = Pxn\n(k)\n\nqxG,n = (1 \u2212 fxm ) PxG,n (kxm ) +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nPxG,n (k),\n\nk=kxm +1\n\npAn\n\nP\n0\nk kPA,n (k)\n= \u03b1n P\n.\nk kPA (k)\n\nAll the B-nodes which do not survive are dependent\n0\nand so the degree distribution at iteration n, PB,n\n(k), is\ngiven by\n\n0\nPB,n\n(k)\n\n=\n\n1\u2212\n\n1\n\u03b2n (1\n\nq\n\n\u2212 q)\n\n!\nPBD (k) +\n\n1\nPBI (k),\n\u03b2n\n\nwhile the fraction of surviving links is\n\npBn\n\nP\n0\nk kPB,n (k)\n.\n= \u03b2n P\nk kPB (k)\n\nThe Largest Component\n0\nWith the degree distribution Px,n\n(k) and the fraction\nof surviving links pxn one can calculate the size of the\nlargest component as\n\nwhere the upper limit of the sum is the maximum degree\nin the network, which we consider to be infinity in the\nthermodynamic limit. The fraction of autonomous nodes\nfrom the original network remaining in the largest component is qxG,n \u03c7n Sx (\u03c7n ), while the total fraction of autonomous nodes is given by 1 \u2212 q. The fraction of nodes\ndisconnected from the largest component that are autonomous is then given by\n1 \u2212 qx,n =\n\n1 \u2212 q \u2212 qxG,n \u03c7n Sx (\u03c7n )\n,\n1 \u2212 \u03c7n Sx (\u03c7n )\n\nso that the fraction of dependent nodes which have fragmented from the largest component is\nqx,n = 1 \u2212\n\n1 \u2212 q \u2212 qxG,n \u03c7n Sx (\u03c7n )\n.\n1 \u2212 \u03c7n Sx (\u03c7n )\n\nFor simplicity, here we assume that kx,m and fxm are\nconstant and do not change during the iterative process. In fact, this is an approximation as the degree of\nthe autonomous nodes is expected to change when their\nneighbors fail. However, in spite of shifting the transition point, this consideration does not change the global\npicture described here.\n\nNumerical simulations\n0\nSx (\u03c7n ) = 1 \u2212 GPxn\n(1 \u2212 pxn + pxn \u03c4xn )\nX\nk\n0\n=1\u2212\nPxn\n(k) (1 \u2212 pxn + pxn \u03c4xn ) ,\n\nNumerical results have been obtained with the efficient\nalgorithm described in Ref.
