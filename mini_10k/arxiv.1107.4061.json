However, Planck's\nderivation explicitly assumes that the radiating object's\ndimensions are large in comparison to a typical thermal\nwavelength.2 Objects in the opposite limit violate this assumption, which leads to coherence effects that make the\nconnection between temperature and the emitted radiation much less straightforward.3,4 Sub-wavelength structure in thermal radiators has recently been shown to lead\nto such unfamiliar effects as directed radiation5 and enhanced coherence lengths.6 A large object described by\nthe Planckian picture radiates incoherently from its welldefined surface area in the lowest approximation, but a\nsmall object contributes coherently with its whole volume\nto the electromagnetic field. Thus a sufficiently small object radiates power in proportion to its volume, not its\nsurface area, and can have an emission efficiency that exceeds the blackbody \"limit\".7 By altering these scaling\nlaws and hence the absolute magnitude of the radiation\nemitted, size effects directly impact how thermodynamic\ntemperature is defined and determined for small objects.\nHere we report the application of single-color (or\nmonochromatic) optical pyrometry to individual incandescent carbon nanotubes.\nIn addition to being small, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are stable at\nhigh temperatures8\u201324 and thus are of interest for\nmany applications, including field emission tips,10,14,15\nnanoscale heaters,22 and incandescent lights.12,25 The\ntemperatures T that CNTs reach have been inferred from the magnitude of their field emission\n\ncurrent,10 their breakdown temperature,26 , the melting of nearby gold nanoparticles,16 T -dependent Raman\nspectroscopy,20,27 scanning thermal microscopy,28 microfabricated Pt thermometers,29 and their current-voltage\nresponse function.30 However, multiwavelength optical\npyrometry is the most common thermometry technique\napplied to CNTs at high temperatures. This general,\nnon-contact method allows the detector to be remote\nfrom the source and is relatively easy to implement above\n1000 K. Thus it has been applied to individual CNTs,13,23\nfilms,11,17,19,21,24,25 and bundles.12,15\nBut while some variant of optical pyrometry is often preferred for measuring high temperatures, in practice the method is challenging to implement accurately\nbecause of uncertainties associated with the radiating\nobject's emissivity.31\u201333 The multiwavelength pyrometry\nmeasurements described in Refs. (11\u201313,15,17,19,21,23\u2013\n25) assume that the nanotube source is a greybody, i.e.\nthat its emissivity \u03b5 is independent of wavelength. The\ngreybody assumption simplifies the thermometry enormously, for then neither detailed knowledge of the source\ngeometry nor an absolute calibration of the light collection apparatus is required; only the relative intensities\nmatter. However, spectral and polarization-dependent\nfeatures have been observed in thermal spectra of both\nCNT films17,19,21 and individual CNTs13,23,34 . Thus\nCNTs are known to have non-trivial emissivities that will\naffect multiwavelength pyrometric measurements.\nPreviously we have calculated the polarizationdependent emission efficiency of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs).34 The net polarization depends only\non the ratio of the efficiency parallel and perpendicular to\nthe nanotube axis. Here we use the absolute magnitude\nof these efficiencies, as opposed to the ratio, to determine\nthe temperature of individual incandescent MWCNTs as\na function of input electrical power. Then single-color\npyrometric measurements, which are modeled on the recommendations for approximating the ITS-90, give a separate temperature determination for each wavelength and\npolarization detected. Comparing these results allows us\n\n\f2\nto quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of our temperature determination. We find that a self-consistent picture emerges where a MWCNT's maximum temperature\nis weakly exponential in the applied electrical power, its\nnormal emission efficiency is \u223c 1 for the parallel polarization and \u223c 0.1 for the perpendicular polarization, its\noptical conductivity is approximately that of graphene,\nand its thermal conductivity decreases by a factor of \u223c 2\nbetween room temperature and 2000 K.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENT AND THEORY\n\nThe experimental procedure, including the arrangement of the light collection apparatus and the fabrication of the MWCNT devices, has been described\npreviously34,35 , but we give a brief summary here (also\nsee Fig 1a). Individual arc-discharge grown MWCNTs\nsuspended on electron-transparent silicon nitride membranes are contacted via e-beam lithography. After its\ndimensions have been determined in a transmission electron microscope (TEM), a MWCNT is brought to incandescence in vacuum by applying a voltage bias. A 100\u00d7\nmicroscope objective (numerical aperture NA= 0.5) collects the light and forms a diffraction-limited image (resolution 0.42\u03bb) on a cooled CCD camera capable of singlephoton detection (Princeton Instruments Pixis 1024BR).\nWith the aid of fourteen 10-nm bandpass color filters and\na Wollaston prism, thermal light emission is measured as\na function of applied bias, wavelength, and polarization.\nAs thermal light sources individual MWCNTs lie in\nthe unusual, intermediate size regime of interest. MWCNTs are large compared to atoms, small molecules, and\neven single-walled CNTs, in that they have many degrees of freedom and are not expected to show strong\nspectroscopic features. However, a typical MWCNT is\nsmall compared to a typical thermal photon wavelength\n\u03bb\u03b3T \u223c ~c/(kB T ) in at least two of its three dimensions. (The nanotubes reported here have outer diameters \u223c 15 nm, lengths \u223c 1 \u03bcm, and \u03bb\u03b3T & 1\u20133 \u03bcm.)\nBecause MWCNTs are thermodynamically \"large\" it is\nreasonable to treat them as having bulk electrical and\nthermal conductivities, dielectric constants, etc. in the\nlowest order approximation. Furthermore, a typical thermal phonon wavelength \u03bbpT \u223c ~vsound /(kB T ) is comparable to the interatomic spacing, which means that a local\ntemperature can be defined. However, because MWCNTs are electrodynamically \"small\" they do not have a\nwell-defined radiating surface area, but rather contribute\nwith their whole volume to the thermal radiation field.\nTo provide a bridge between the \"large\" object, geometric optics picture and the \"small\" object, physical optics picture,36 it is useful7 to define an emission\n(equivalent to absorption by Kirchhoff's law) cross section C(\u03bb, p, \u03a9), which is a function of wavelength \u03bb, polarization p, and emission direction \u03a9 = (\u03b8, \u03c6). This\ncross section plays the role normally filled by the product\nA\u03b5(\u03bb, p, \u03a9) where A is the surface area and \u03b5 is the emis-\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) (a) Nanolamp device architecture\nand optical measurement configuration (not to scale).

Thus, for emitters with dimensions small compared to a wavelength, the number of thermal photons\nwith polarization p, per bandwidth d\u03bb, per unit solid angle d\u03a9, emitted in direction \u03a9 is given by\n\u1e44\n1\nc\n,\n= C(\u03bb, p, \u03a9) 4 C /\u03bbT\nd\u03bbd\u03a9\n\u03bb e 2\n\u22121\n\n(1)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light in vacuum and C2 = hc/kB =\n14.4 \u03bcm * kK is the second radiation constant. For ease\nof comparison with the geometric optics limit, the cross\nsection C is split into a product C = A\u2032 Q, where A\u2032 is\nthe \"hard\" projected area in the normal direction (as determined by TEM, for instance) and Q is the efficiency.\nThe efficiency is the small-radiator equivalent of the emissivity, but unlike the emissivity its values are not constrained to be less than unity.7 The efficiency also includes the geometric factors that account for the relative\n\n\f3\norientation of the emitting object and emission direction,\ne.g. a cosine in the case of a Lambertian emitter.\nTo extract the nanotube temperature from a measurement of the emitted light intensity, we require a detailed\nmodel of the relationship between the nanotube temperature distribution and the image captured by the CCD.\nThe calculation proceeds in two steps. First, we map the\nnanotube's three-dimensional radiation field onto a fictitious two-dimensional object plane, including efficiency\neffects from the object, the optics, and the camera. Second, we map the object plane intensity onto the CCD\nin the image plane by convoluting it with the microscope\npoint spread function (PSF), which we approximate with\na Gaussian.37\nAs a function of position, polarization, and filter, the\nobject plane intensity \u022ep,f (xo , yo ) for a nanotube of outer\nradius b oriented along the x-axis, in units of counts per\nsecond per area, is\n\u022ep,f (xo , yo ) = H(b + yo )H(b \u2212 yo )\nZ\nc\n\u0398f \u2206\u03bb\n\u00d7 4 C /\u03bbT (x )\nQ(\u03a9, \u03bb, p)d\u03a9, (2)\no \u2212 1\n\u03bb e 2\nNA\nwhere H is the Heaviside step function, \u0398f is the quantum efficiency of the optical system for filter f , and\n\u2206\u03bb is the filter bandwidth. The function T (xo ) =\nTm + (T0 \u2212 Tm )(2xo /L)2 in the Planck factor describes\nthe parabolic temperature distribution supported by a\nMWCNT device of length L under bias;35 as shown in\nFig. 1b, the temperature peaks at the midpoint (Tm ) and\ndecreases to T0 at the contacts.\nIn the convolution integral we approximate the product\nH(yo \u2212 b)H(yo + b) as 2b\u03b4(yo ) since the nanotube outer\nradius b is small compared to the effective CCD pixel size\n\u03b2 and the PSF width s = 0.21\u03bb/NA. Integrated over a\nCCD pixel labeled by integers (i, j), the PSF has the\nGaussian form\nPSF(i, j, xo , yo ) = \u03b2 2\n\n2 +(j\u03b2\u2212y )2\no\nNA2 \u03c0 (i\u03b2\u2212xo )\u22122s\n2\ne\n,\n\u03bb2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere we have taken the mean intensity over a pixel to be\nequal to the central intensity. The normalization chosen\nfor Eq.

(4) to find the peak temperature Tm .\nTo solve for Tm all of the other variables must be determined. The central wavelength \u03bb and the bandpass \u2206\u03bb\nare specified by the optical filter supplier (Chroma Technology). For all filters the nominal bandpass is 10 nm,\nwithin the range recommended for realizing the ITS-90.\nThe effective pixel size \u03b2 = 127 nm is the physical pixel\nsize of 13 \u03bcm divided by the system magnification, which\nwe find to be 2% bigger than its nominal value of 100 by\nimaging a Ronchi ruling. The PSF width s = 0.42\u03bb is\nverified by fitting the image spatial intensity to a 2D\nGaussian function.35 The remaining parameters are \u0398f ,\nthe nanotube geometry variables, QNA , and \u03b7.\nWe determine the collection efficiency \u0398f in counts\nper photon by imaging a 100 \u03bcm-diameter stainless steel\npinhole (Thorlabs) illuminated from behind by a 45 W\ncalibrated tungsten lamp at a distance of 50 cm. The pinhole diameter is chosen to be smaller than the microscope\nfield of view to allow focusing, but larger than the wavelengths of interest and the pinhole thickness (12.5 \u03bcm)\nto minimize diffraction effects. The lamp supplier (Newport Corporation) specifies the spectral irradiance \u039b in\nmW/m2 nm at this distance with an uncertainty of 3%.\nMeasurements of the collected signal as a function of exposure time under constant illumination conditions verify that the non-linearity of the CCD is less than 1%, as\nspecified by the camera manufacturer. Averaging over\n\u223c 105 illuminated pixels, we find \u1e6045W , which is related\nto \u039b and \u0398f by\n\u1e6045W = \u03b2 2\n\n\u03bb\u039b(\u03bb)\n\u2206\u03bb \u0398f .\nhc\n\n(7)\n\nSince the lamp subtends a small solid angle at this distance from the objective, the measurement of \u1e6045W gives\na value for the product \u2206\u03bb \u0398f that is strictly valid only\nnear normal incidence. Light rays exit the objective at\nsmall angles relative to the optical axis, so this distinction\nis negligible except at the vacuum window and objective\nlens. However, the Fresnel equations indicate that the error introduced even for rays at the edge of the numerical\naperture is always . 10 %.\nThe nanotube outer radius b and length L (see Fig. 1b)\nare determined with an FEI Titan 80-300 TEM operating\n\n\f4\nof graphene, \u03c3g = \u03c0\u03b1/Z0 (Refs. 38\u201342):\nQ|| (0) \u2248 n\u03c0 2 \u03b1 \u2248 .072n,\nQ\u22a5 (0) \u2248\n\nFIG. 2: (a) TEM image of a nanolamp device prior to biasing.

Due to\nthe high temperatures achieved the membrane near the nanotube midpoint has failed, and the nanotube is broken. The\nsquares correspond to pixels on the CCD (effective dimension\n\u03b2 = 127 nm). Pixels near the nanotube midpoint are labeled\nwith Tm values in kelvins as calculated by inverting Eq.

The images captured\nconfirm the composition and structure of the MWCNT\nradiator, i.e. concentric, tubular sheets of pure carbon.\nThe TEM also determines the inner radius a and the\nnumber of walls n, variables that figure into the calculation of Q and cannot be determined with other microscopy techniques, e.g. SEM, AFM, or STM. The parameters xi , yi , and \u03c6 describing the nanotube position\nrelative to the CCD coordinate system are determined\nby aligning a sequence of optical and TEM images of the\ndevice.35 Figure 2a shows a TEM image of a representative nanolamp.\nThe filament's efficiency Qp (\u03b8 = \u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03b6, \u03c6) we have\ncalculated previously34 using classical Mie theory, modeling the MWCNT as a hollow right cylinder with a complex dielectric constant \u01eb. Because the nanotube and\noptical axes are orthogonal\n(see Fig. 1), we perform the\nR\nangular integral NA Qd\u03a9 numerically. To illustrate how\nthe efficiencies depend upon the filament conductivity, we\nhere give their normal-incidence values Q(0, \u03c6) \u2261 Q(0)\nwith Re(\u01eb) = 1 and Im(\u01eb) set by the optical conductance\n\n16\u03c0 2 n\u03b4 2\n\u2248 .005n\n\u03b1\u03bb2\n\n\u0012\n\n700 nm\n\u03bb\n\n\u00132\n\n,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03b1 \u2243 1/137 is the fine structure constant, Z0 \u2243\n377 \u03a9 is the impedance of free space, \u03b4 \u2243 0.34 nm is the\ninterwall spacing, and n is the number of walls. Both\nefficiencies Q are proportional to n, which implies that\nthe cross sections are proportional the tube volume, as\nexpected for a \"small\" object. The nanotubes reported\nin this study have dimensions and wall numbers such\nthat Q|| (0) \u223c 1 and Q\u22a5 (0) \u223c 0.1. For n \u2265 14 walls,\nQ|| (0) > 1, giving a cross section that is larger than the\ngeometric cross section. Note also that, as the filament\nconductivity \u221d \u03b1 increases, Q|| (0) increases while Q\u22a5 (0)\ndecreases. This stark difference in qualitative behavior\nprovides a strong consistency check, as we will show later.\nWith all of the variables determined Eq. (4) has no\nfree parameters.

Our devices are not in the large L\nlimit; the implicit dependence of \u03b7 on Tm makes Eq.

(4) gives values of Tm (P, i, j, \u03bb, p)\nas a function of input electrical power P , pixel location\n(i, j), wavelength \u03bb, and polarization p. If the nanotube\nis in a steady state with a fixed value of P , it is reasonable to combine measurements corresponding to different\n(i, j), \u03bb, and p to arrive at a best estimate T\u0304m for the\ntemperature at the midpoint.\nTo find T\u0304m (P, \u03bb, p) from the data in a single image\nwe weight the Tm valuepfrom each pixel according to\nthe shot noise error \u221d\nS(i, j). Based on the num4\nber of photoelectrons captured per\n\u221a CCD pixel Ne & 10\nwe expect signal fluctuations 1/ Ne . 1%, which according to Eq.

The observed deviations are \u03b4Tm /Tm \u223c\n1%, which may reflect the approximations inherent in\nour model. Nonetheless this spatial uniformity of the\ntemperature determination shows that the model summarized by Eqs. (4\u20136) is reasonable at the percent level.\nThe temperatures T\u0304m (P, \u03bb, p) determined for a representative device are shown in Fig. 3. These temperatures\nare approximately linear with respect to the power applied to the nanotube over \u223c 700 K. Excepting the data\nfrom the two longest wavelengths in the parallel polarization, at a given power the temperatures determined\nat different wavelengths fall within a range 60\u2013160 K for\nall of the devices studied. Again, error analysis of, e.g.\nEq. (9) indicates that the uncertainty in a single-color\ntemperature determination is proportional to the wavelength (and temperature), so long wavelengths (and high\ntemperatures) are expected to give the least reliable temperature determinations. However, the magnitude of the\ndiscrepancy at 1050 nm and 1100 nm in the parallel polarization is not understood.\nTo find T\u0304m (P, p) we weight T\u0304m (P, \u03bb, p) according to an\nerror \u221d \u03bb. Figure 4 shows T\u0304m (P, p) for 6 different devices\nwith lengths ranging from 1160 nm to 1900 nm and wall\nnumbers between 13 and 25. For each device the weighted\nstandard deviation across wavelengths is . 100 K, which\nwe take to be our uncertainty. For these devices the\naverage difference between T\u0304m (P, ||) and T\u0304m (P, \u22a5) is 70 K\nwith no discrepancies greater than 160 K, also consistent\nwith our claimed uncertainty.\nThe degree of consistency between the temperature\ndeterminations for different polarizations, wavelengths,\nand positions on the CCD is not necessarily an indication of their accuracy, for it could reflect a systematic\nerror. The dominant source of systematic uncertainty\nhere is the emission efficiency Q, which we have calculated from reasonable but approximate first principles.\nWe assign the Q calculation an uncertainty \u03b4Q/Q \u223c 0.5,\nreflecting our limited a priori knowledge of the nan-\n\nF\n\nSiO2\n\n2000\n\nSi3 N4\n\n1500\n\n1000\n440\n\nF\nF\n\nC\n\nTm HKL\n\n2400\n\nL\n1900\n1560\n1160\n2080\n1190\n1270\n200\n\nb\n7.6\n6.5\n7.4\n7.2\n7.4\n10.6\n\na\n2.0\n2.3\n1.7\n1.5\n2.5\n2.2\n300\n\nn\n16\n12\n17\n17\n14\n25\n\nJmax\n0.54\n1.00\n0.93\n0.81\n1.43\n0.72\n\n\u03a3\n1.12\n0.63\n0.65\n0.84\n1.06\n1.17\n\nThigh\n2260\n2130\n2100\n2290\n2300\n2050\n\n\u039ae\n130\n290\n210\n240\n220\n120\n\nT0\u00a2\n-700\n-180\n190\n-940\n-360\n-400\n\n400\n500\nApplied Power H\u039cWL\n\n\u039a0\n260\n390\n240\n520\n700\n290\n\nT\u039a\n1900\n3300\n8100\n1500\n500\n1000\n\nT0\n100\n230\n340\n0\n630\n750\n\n600\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Plot of averaged temperatures T\u0304m (P, p)\nversus power P for 6 devices, as determined for both polarizations p separately and assuming graphene's optical conductivity. Temperatures corresponding to thickness loss rates of\n1 nm/s for various materials are indicated with solid horizontal lines. An additional dashed horizontal line indicates a loss\nrate of one graphene monolayer per minute. The inset table\nshows for each device the final best estimates for the highest Tm achieved, Thigh , which is computed by adjusting the\nconductivity \u03c3 (in units of graphene's optical conductivity)\nto a value such that T\u0304m (P, ||) and T\u0304m (P, \u22a5) are in agreement.\nOther nanotube parameters are also given: the length L, the\nouter radius b, the inner radius a (all in nm), the number of\nwalls n, and the maximum current density Jmax (in \u03bcA/nm2 ).\nThe \u03ba's (in W/m * K) and other T 's (in K) result from fits to\ndetermine the thermal conductivity as described in the main\ntext.

Such an uncertainty im2\nplies \u03b4Tm \u223c (\u03bbTm\n/C2 )(\u03b4Q/Q) . 90 K, consistent with\nthe range we find experimentally. However, because Q||\nand Q\u22a5 happen to have such dissimilar dependences on\nthe optical conductivity, the consistency of the determinations of T\u0304m (P, ||) and T\u0304m (P, \u22a5) provides a powerful,\nindependent validation of both the initial estimate of the\noptical conductivity and the claimed uncertainty.\nIt is not necessary to assume an initial value for the\noptical conductivity \u03c3 that appears in the Mie calculation of the efficiencies. Treating \u03c3 as a free parameter,\nwe find that it can only vary in a narrow range and still\naccomodate the data in both polarizations. The table\ninset in Fig. 4 shows how \u03c3, in units of the graphene\nvalue \u03c3g /\u03b4 \u2243 1/(5590 \u03bc\u03a9 cm), must be adjusted to bring\nT\u0304m (P, ||) and T\u0304m (P, \u22a5) into agreement. The adjustment\nis small in all cases: typically . 15%, with a most discrepant value of 37%. Thus, barring breakdown of the\nconducting tube model of the nanotube filament, consistency requires that these nanotubes have optical conductivities in a relatively narrow range around \u03c0\u03b1/(Z0 \u03b4),\nand that the efficiencies Q and temperatures Tm which\nlogically follow have the claimed values to within the\ngiven uncertainties.\n\n\f6\n\nIn Fig. 5 we plot this data for a representative device,\nalong with the single-color pyrometry expectation\nh\u1e44 iL,\u03a9\n\n2bc\u2206\u03bb\n=\n\u03bb4\n\nR\n\nQ d\u03a9\nNA\nR abs\nNA d\u03a9\n\nR L/2\n\n\u2212L/2\n\ne\u2212C2 /\u03bbT (x) dx\nL\n\n, (11)\n\nwhere we take T0 = 300 and Tm from the analysis used\nto produce Fig. 4.

Two curves reflecting changes to Q by\na factor of 2 and one curve representing the multiwavelength analysis are also shown for each polarization.\nAs expected, the two-parameter multiwavelength fit\nis visibly superior to the single-color direct calculation,\nwithin a given polarization. However, the agreement between the temperatures found for the two polarizations\nis markedly inferior. For the six devices shown in Fig. 4,\nsingle color pyrometery gives T\u0304m (Pmax , ||) \u2212 T\u0304m (Pmax , \u22a5)\nof 70 K on average, with a standard deviation 70 K\n\n105\n\n2QMie\n\n103\nQMie \u00902\n\n2300 K\n2776 K\n\nXN\\W,L H\u0393\u0090s\u00d7nmL\n\nIn addition to presenting an internally consistent picture, the derived temperatures are reasonable considering the observed physical modifications to the membrane\nand the nanotubes themselves. Graphite, silicon nitride,\nand silicon dioxide are observed to sublime in vacuum at\nhigh temperatures, with thickness loss rates of \u223c 1 nm/s\nat 2400 K, 1700 K, and 2100 K respectively.44\u201346 (TEM\nenergy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy measurements indicate that the membranes contain some residual SiO2\nin addition to the Si3 N4 .) For graphite and silicon nitride these loss rates - substantial for nanoscale devices\n- occur many hundreds of kelvin below their melting\ntemperatures. At 2200 K graphite evaporates at a rate\ncorresponding to one graphene layer per minute, which is\nroughly the timescale of our longest exposures (2 min).\nThe three nanotubes labeled \"F\" in Fig. 4 failed while\nunder observation at temperatures of 2260, 2210, and\n2390 K respectively. (In the latter two cases the temperatures represent extrapolations of \u223c 100 K since the\ndevices failed shortly after 0.1 V increases in the applied bias.) All six devices showed substantial, thermallyinduced holes (lengths 0.3\u20130.7 L) in their silicon nitride\nmembranes. Thus the decomposition temperatures seen\nin the nanolamp devices agree with those expected for\nsuch materials.\nTo compare single-color pyrometry with the more common multiwavelength pyrometry, we take the filament to\nbe grey and vary both the efficiency Q and Tm to best fit\nthe data at the 14 different wavelengths.

The dots, colored\nas in Fig. 3, are the maximum power data from Eq. (10). The\nsolid curves give the single-color pyrometry expectation described by Eq. (11), which is based on the Mie calculation of\nthe efficiency Q and the temperatures shown in Fig 4. The\ndashed curves show how the rates change if the Q's are altered\nby a factor of 2. The dotted curves are the best greybody fits\nusing the multiwavelength method.\n\nand a maximum discrepancy of 160 K. For multiwavelength pyrometry the equivalent numbers are 190 K,\n110 K, and 330 K, which is to say that the consistency\nbetween polarizations of multicolor pyrometry is worse\nby a factor \u223c 2. The multiwavelength results also give\nThigh \u223c 2700 K, corresponding to a vapor pressure of\ncarbon above graphite of 10\u22126 atm, or an erosion rate\nof 10 nm/s.45 Thus, if a single temperature characterizes\nthe radiation intensity for both polarizations and these\nMWCNTs are not markedly more refractory than the\nthermodynamic ground state of carbon, the single-color\npyrometric method gives results that are both more internally consistent and more physically reasonable. The\nlarger temperatures47 returned by the multiwavelength\nanalysis also require that both Q|| and Q\u22a5 be smaller by\nan order of magnitude to give the observed signal levels.\nWithin our simple model for the dielectric constant, such\n\n\f7\nsmall efficiencies cannot be simultaneously arranged with\nany value of the optical conductivity.\nWith the final temperature determinations and the\nnanotubes' dimensions we extract values for the MWCNTs' thermal conductivity \u03ba using two different models.\nTo compare with previous work, we fit the Fig. 4 data to\nthe function Tm = T0\u2032 + mP . The maximum temperature\nTm increases roughly linearly with the applied power P ,\nconsistent with a temperature-independent \u03ba. Approximating the nanotube resistivity to be also temperature\nindependent gives the slope m in terms of the thermal\nconductivity, m = L/(8\u03bae \u03c0(b2 \u2212 a2 )) (Refs. 8,26,35). We\nfind \u03bae = 100 \u2212 300 W/m * K (see table inset in Fig. 4),\nconsistent with previous experiments that have applied\nvarious thermometric assumptions to strongly-biased individual MWCNTs and have found values ranging from\n50 to 600 W/m*K8,16,26 . The values \u03bae of the effective\nthermal conductivity correspond to an average over the\nrange from 300 K to 2300 K, since \u03ba is not constant but\nrather decreasing above room temperature16 .\nThe slight curvature in the curves T\u0304m (P, p) shown\nin Fig. 4 and the consistently low values for the zeropower temperature T0\u2032 are evidence of this temperature\nvariation. We build a more complete model by adopting the functional form for the thermal conductivity\n\u03ba(T ) = \u03ba0 /(1+(T \u2212T0 )/T\u03ba ), which can describe both the\nconstant \u03ba and Umklapp scattering-dominated \u03ba \u221d 1/T\ncases with suitable parameter choices.

This thermometry technique requires absolute\ncalibration of the light collection apparatus and absolute\nknowledge of the thermal emission cross section of the\nMWCNTs. The physical cross sections are determined\nusing TEM, and the emission efficiencies are calculated\nby solving Maxwell's equations for a conducting tube.\nSince the MWCNTs have radii which are much smaller\nthan a thermal wavelength, the emission efficiency model\ninherently assumes phase coherence across the radiating\nvolume. Comparing the temperature values determined\nacross pixels, wavelengths, and polarizations shows that\nthe model is internally consistent, and more consistent\nthan one based on multiwavelength pyrometry. Furthermore, because the nanolamp emission efficiency increases\nin one polarization as it decreases in the other as a function of the optical conductivity, the nanolamp optical\nconductivity is completely determined by the degree of\npolarization observed in the data. Experimentally we\nfind that \u03c3 = 0.9\u00b10.2 in units of idealized graphene's optical conductivity \u03c0\u03b1/(Z0 \u03b4). This conductivity fixes the\nemission efficiency, which in turn determines the temperatures. The nanolamps' observed lifetimes and derived\ntemperatures are consistent with a sublimation failure\nmode. The MWCNTs have thermal conductivities ranging from 400 \u00b1 200 W/m * K at room temperature to\n200\u00b1100 W/m*K at 2000 K. These values, while extraordinarily high compared to most materials at elevated\ntemperatures, are consistent with previous measurements\non this material. Thus we find that optical pyrometry\nbased on absolute measurements of visible incandescence\ngives a consistent picture of structurally-characterized radiators that are both large enough to have bulk electronic\nproperties and small compared to a thermal wavelength.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis project is supported by NSF CAREER Grant No.\n0748880.

Hashimoto, Nature 347, 53 (1990).\nSince we are operating in the Wien limit, the high temperatures returned by the multiwavelength analysis imply\nthat the emissivity model used (the greybody model) overestimates the intensity at long wavelengths relative to that\nat short wavelengths. The observed deficits at the red end\nof the spectrum thus contribute to an overestimation of\nthe temperature. We find that reasonable, non-grey emissivity models with adjustable parameters return temperatures that, depending on the functional form chosen, range\nover more than 1500 K, which again emphasizes the advantage having a fixed emissivity model.\n\n\f"}
