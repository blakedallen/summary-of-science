Follow up observations in the submillimetre show that\nthese QSOs are embedded in ultraluminous starburst galaxies, unlike most unabsorbed QSOs at the same redshifts and luminosities. Here we present X-ray spectra\nfrom XMM-Newton for a sample of 5 such X-ray absorbed QSOs that have been\ndetected at submillimetre wavelengths. We also present spectra in the restframe\nultraviolet from ground based telescopes. All 5 QSOs are found to exhibit strong\nC IV absorption lines in their ultraviolet spectra with equivalent width > 5\u00c5. The\nX-ray spectra are inconsistent with the hypothesis that these objects show normal QSO continua absorbed by low-ionization gas. Instead, the spectra can be\nmodelled successfully with ionized absorbers, or with cold absorbers if they posess\nunusually flat X-ray continuum shapes and unusual optical to X-ray spectral energy distributions. We show that the ionized absorber model provides the simplest,\nmost self-consistent explanation for their observed properties. We estimate that\nthe fraction of radiated power that is converted into kinetic luminosity of the outflowing winds is typically \u223c 4 per cent, in agreement with recent estimates for the\nkinetic feedback from QSOs required to produce the M \u2212 \u03c3 relation, and consistent with the hypothesis that the X-ray absorbed QSOs represent the transition\nphase between obscured accretion and the luminous QSO phase in the evolution\nof massive galaxies.\nKey words: X-rays: galaxies \u2013 galaxies: active \u2013 galaxies: evolution \u2013 galaxies:\nformation\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe prevalence of black holes in present-day galaxy bulges,\nand the proportionality between black hole and spheroid\nmass (Magorrian et al., 1998; Merritt & Ferrarese, 2001)\nimplies that the formation of the stars in a presentday galaxy spheroid was fundamentally connected to the\ngrowth of the black hole as an active galactic nucleus\n(AGN). In fact, an evolutionary connection between the\nstar-forming and AGN-dominated phases of galaxies has\nlong been posited (e.g. Sanders et al., 1988).\nIt is now known that a significant fraction of cosmic\nstar formation took place in submillimetre galaxies\n(SMGs): dusty, ultraluminous, and highly obscured\ngalaxies at high redshift (Smail, Ivison & Blain, 1997;\nHughes et al., 1998). Although some distant QSOs\nhave been detected as submillimetre sources in\npointed observations (e.g.\nMcMahon et al., 1999;\nPage et al., 2001), the overlap between the QSO and\nc 0000 RAS\n\nSMG populations is relatively small (Fabian et al., 2000;\nSevergnini et al., 2000;\nAlmaini et al., 2003;\nWaskett et al., 2003; Lutz et al., 2010). In an attempt\nto uncover the relationship between quasi-stellar objects\n(QSOs) and SMGs, Page et al. (2004) observed matched\nsamples of X-ray absorbed and unabsorbed QSOs at\n850\u03bcm with SCUBA. These observations revealed a\nremarkable dichotomy in the submillimetre properties\nof these two groups of sources: a substantial fraction\n(\u223c 50 per cent) of X-ray absorbed QSOs are submillimetre galaxies, while X-ray unabsorbed (i.e. normal)\nQSOs are not. This suggests that the two types are\nlinked by an evolutionary sequence, in which the X-ray\nabsorbed QSOs correspond to the transition between\nthe main star-forming phase and the QSO phase of a\nmassive galaxy (Page et al., 2004; Stevens et al., 2005;\nCoppin et al., 2008). The space density and luminosities\nof the X-ray absorbed QSOs indicate that this transitional\n\n\fPage, et al.\n\nphase is relatively brief, \u223c15 per cent of the duration of\nthe luminous QSO phase.\nHowever, the physical driver for this transition between obscured star-forming galaxy and luminous QSO\nis unknown. Furthermore, the nature of the X-ray absorption in the X-ray absorbed QSOs remains puzzling.\nThese objects are characterised by hard, absorbed X-ray\nspectra, but they have optical/UV spectra which are typical for QSOs, with broad emission lines and blue continua. Assuming that their hard X-ray spectral shapes\nresult from photoelectric absorption from cold material\nwith solar abundances, the column densities are of order\n1022 cm\u22122 . The X-ray absorption could be due to gas located within the AGN structure, or from more distant\nmaterial in the host galaxy. Wherever the absorber is located, it appears to contain very little dust: for a Galactic\ngas/dust ratio, the restframe ultraviolet spectra would be\nheavily attenuated by such large columns of material.\nTherefore in order to investigate the X-ray absorption in these objects, we have obtained deep (50\u2013\n100ks) XMM-Newton observations of five X-ray absorbed QSOs from our sample of hard-spectrum Rosat\nsources (Page, Mittaz & Carrera, 2001) that were detected as powerful submillimetre sources with SCUBA\n(Page et al., 2001; Stevens et al., 2005).\nThroughout this paper we assume H0\n=\n70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9m = 0.3, and \u03a9\u039b = 0.7. We\ndefine a power law spectrum such that f\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u2212\u03b1 ; we\nassign the energy index \u03b1 the subscript X when it refers\nto the X-ray spectral slope, O when it refers to the\noptical/ultraviolet spectral slope and OX when it refers\nto the optical to X-ray spectral slope.\n\n6\n\n2.1\n\nOBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\nOptical spectra\n\nRXJ005734 was observed on the 22nd November 1998,\nwith the ESO 3.6m telescope at La Silla, Chile. The\nEFOSC 2 spectrograph was used with the 5000\u00c5 blaze,\n300 lines mm\u22121 grism covering the wavelength range\n3800\u00c5 to 8000\u00c5, with a spectral resolution of 20\u00c5 FWHM.\nRXJ094144, RXJ121803 and RXJ163308 were observed on the 3rd-5th March 1998 with the William Herschel Telescope at the Observatorio del Roque de los\nMuchachos, La Palma. The dual arm ISIS spectrograph\nwas used with the 5400 \u00c5 dichroic, the R158R grating on\nthe red arm and the R300B grating on the blue arm. The\ntwo ISIS arms combined give continuous coverage of the\nwavelength range 3200\u00c5 to 8100 \u00c5 with resolution of 5\u00c5\nFWHM in the blue and 9\u00c5 FWHM in the red.\nIn both observing runs, arc-lamp spectra and observations of spectrophotometric standard stars were taken for\nwavelength and flux calibration. The spectra were reduced\nand calibrated using standard routines in IRAF.\nRXJ124913 was not observed because it is a\nwell known broad absorption line QSO (BALQSO)\nwith optical spectra available in the literature;\nthe spectrum shown in Fig. 1 is taken from\nJunkkarinen, Burbidge & Smith (1987).\n\nRXJ005734 z=2.185\nCIV\nCIII]\n\n2\n0\n1.5\n\nMgII\nCIV\n\nCIII]\n\n1\n0.5\n\nRXJ094144 z=1.819\n\n0\n1\n\nCIV\nCIII]\n\nRXJ121803 z=1.743\n\n0.5\n0\n15\n\nLy\u03b1\n\nMgII\n\nRXJ124913 z=2.236\nCIV\n\n10\n\nCIII]\n\n5\n0\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n\nLy\u03b1\n\nRXJ163308 z=2.802\nCIV\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\n6000\n\nCIII]\n\n7000\n\n8000\n\n\u03bb (\u00c5)\nFigure 1.

The data were reduced with XMMNewton SAS version 6.5, and the calibration release of\nJune 2006. After initial processing of the EPIC MOS\nand pn data, spectra were extracted from a circular region of 15 arcsecond radius, centred on the target. Background was obtained from a circular region of radius\n150 arcseconds, within which all significant sources were\nmasked out. Appropriate response matrices and effective area files were generated with the SAS tasks rmfgen and arfgen. For each object, spectra and response\nmatrices were combined using the method described in\nPage, Davis & Salvi (2003). To determine how the fluxes\nof the sources compared to those obtained in our original\nRosat survey, we fitted the spectra below 2 keV with a\npowerlaw and fixed Galactic absorption. For RXJ005734,\nRXJ121803 and RXJ163308 we obtain 0.5 \u2212 2 keV fluxes\nof 1.2 \u00d7 10\u221214 , 1.5 \u00d7 10\u221214 and 1.8 \u00d7 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121\nrespectively, consistent with those obtained with Rosat\n(Page, Mittaz & Carrera, 2000). For RXJ094144 we obtain a 0.5 \u2212 2 keV flux of 5 \u00d7 10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , approximately a quarter of its flux during our Rosat survey, while for RXJ124913 we obtain a 0.5 \u2212 2 keV flux of\n1.3 \u00d7 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , approximately half the Rosat\nflux reported by Page, Mittaz & Carrera (2000).\nSimultaneous with the X-ray observations, the XMMNewton Optical Monitor (XMM-OM) took deep images\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\f3\n\nThe nature of X-ray absorbed QSOs\n\nTable 1.

The UVW1 magnitudes of RXJ094144\nand RXJ121803 (in the XM-OM Vega system) are given\nin Table 1.\n\nz = 2.244 (Hill, Thompson & Elston, 1993) depending on\nwhich emission lines the redshift is based on. Relative to\nthis emission line redshift, the C IV broad absorption line\nhas a central velocity of -16700 km s\u22121 , with a FWHM\nof 5700 km s\u22121 (Boksenberg et al., 1978). In RXJ163308\nthere are four absorption lines visible, but two of these are\nlikely to be due to an intervening absorption line system\nwith z = 1.482, for which a number of other transitions\nare detected in the optical spectrum. The remaining two\nlines have outflow velocities of 800 and 7700 km s\u22121 . Both\nare accompanied by Ly\u03b1 absorption with consistent velocities, and absorption from Si IV is detected in the 7700\nkm s\u22121 component. The C IV absorption line properties\nof the five QSOs are listed in Table 2.\n\n3\n\nThe five QSOs have strong rest-frame ultraviolet continuum emission. Ultraviolet spectral slopes were measured from the optical spectra, longward of Ly\u03b1, after\nmasking emission and absorption lines. The ultraviolet\nspectral slopes are listed in Table 2. With the exception of\nRXJ094144, the ultraviolet continua of the five QSOs have\nspectral slopes in the range 0 < \u03b1O < 1, which is typical\nfor optically-selected QSOs (Francis et al., 1991), indicating little or no dust reddening intrinsic to these objects.\nOn the other hand, as can be seen in Fig. 1 the rest-frame\nultraviolet continuum of RXJ094144 is much redder than\nthose of the other objects. The continuum slope in this object is \u03b1o = 2.7, outlying from the distribution of opticallyselected QSOs at the 3\u03c3 level (Francis et al., 1991), and\nsuggesting that this object may be somewhat dust reddened. The ultraviolet spectral shape can be matched by\nreddening the median Sloan Digital Sky Survey QSO spectrum (Vanden Berk et al., 2001) by E(B\u2212V)=0.20 using\nthe SMC reddening law (Pei, 1992), a similar level of extinction as observed in the nearby starburst/BALQSO\nIRAS 07598 + 6508 (Lipari, 1994), and suggesting \u223c1.4\nmagnitudes of extinction at 2500\u00c5 in the restframe. The\nUVW1\u2212B colour of RXJ094144 (where the B magnitude\ncomes from Page, Mittaz & Carrera 2001) is in reasonable\nagreement with this reddened template: after correction\nfor Galactic extinction the UVW1-B colour of RXJ094144\nis 0.47 \u00b1 0.18 compared to UVW1\u2212B=0.71 predicted by\nthe reddened template. In contrast, RXJ121803 has a\nmuch bluer UVW1\u2212B=\u22120.45 \u00b1 0.11 after correction for\n\n3.1\n\nRESULTS\nAbsorption in the rest-frame ultraviolet\n\nBroadband optical spectra of the five X-ray absorbed\nQSOs are shown in Fig. 1. It is notable that in all five\nobjects, at least one absorption line is superimposed on\nthe broad C IV emission line or on the continuum to the\nblue of this line. To examine this more closely, we show the\nregions around the C IV emission line in more detail in Fig.\n2. In RXJ005734, there are two absorption lines apparent,\nwith outflow velocities of 4800 and 8100 km s\u22121 , assuming that they are C IV. In the spectrum of RXJ094144,\nat least one absorption line is present, apparently inflowing with a velocity of 700 km s\u22121 assuming that it is\nC IV. As this spectrum is relatively noisy, we are unable\nto confirm whether the tentative absorption features to\nthe blue of C IV are real or statistical fluctuations. There\nare two significant absorption features in RXJ121803,\none inflowing at 1200 km s\u22121 , and one outflowing at\n1600 km s\u22121 . Mg II absorption is detected from the inflowing component. For RXJ124913 we adopt an emission line redshift of z = 2.236 (Hewitt & Burbidge, 1993),\nalthough the reported emission line redshift of this\nsource ranges from z = 2.22 (Boksenberg et al., 1978) to\n1\n\nUVW1 images were not obtained during the July 2001 observation of RXJ124913, in which the UV grism of XMM-OM\nwas used instead.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\f4\n\nRXJ094144\n\n700\n\n800\n\n12\n\n2.7\n\nRXJ121803\nRXJ121803\n\n1200\n-1600\n\n900\n900\n\n15\n14\n\n1.0\n1.0\n\nRXJ124913\n\n-16700\n\n5700\n\n70\n\n1.0\n\nRXJ163308\nRXJ163308\n\n-800\n-7700\n\n700\n700\n\n11\n10\n\n0.1\n0.1\n\nGalactic extinction.

As a starting point, the XMM-Newton\nspectra were fitted with a similar model to that considered by Page, Mittaz & Carrera (2001): a power law with\na fixed \u03b1X of 0.98, fixed Galactic absorption, and cold\nphotoelectric absorption at the QSO redshift with NH\nas a free parameter. The value of \u03b1X = 0.98 was chosen because it is the mean spectral index of QSOs in the\nXMM-Newton energy range and at similar X-ray flux levels to our targets, as determined by Mateos et al. (2005)\nand confirmed in more recent work (Mateos et al., 2010).\nThe results are given in Table 3. Although some of the\nindividual objects are successfully fit by this model, others are not (RXJ121803 and RXJ124913), and the total\n\u03c72 /\u03bd = 225/161 for the sample of 5 objects is not acceptable. Therefore, we attempted to fit the spectra with two\nmodels, one in which the continuum spectral slope was allowed to vary, and one in which the ionization parameter\nof the absorber was allowed to vary.\nAs seen in Table 3, allowing the continuum spectral\nindices or the ionization parameters of the absorbers to\nvary produced acceptable values of \u03c72 /\u03bd for the 5 objects\nindividually, and as a sample. Since the two models are\nequivalent in terms of \u03c72 /\u03bd, we can only discriminate between the two models by looking to see which provides the\nmore physically plausible and self-consistent explanation\nfor the spectra. In particular, we can test the hypothesis\nthat the underlying spectra of these objects are reasonably typical for QSOs, and their unusual observed spectral\nshapes are due to absorption. Two properties in particular\nare important in this context: the spectral index of the underlying X-ray spectrum, and the ratio of optical to X-ray\n\n2\n\nRXJ094144\n\nModelling the X-ray spectra\n\nFlux (10\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121)\n\n3.2\n\n2\n\n0.6\n0.6\n\n1\n\n5\n2\n\n0\n\n500\n500\n\n1\n\n-4800\n-8100\n\n0.5\n\nRXJ005734\nRXJ005734\n\n0\n\n\u03b1o\n\n1\n\nC IV EW\n(\u00c5)\n\n0.5\n\nC IV FWHM\n(km s\u22121 )\n\nRXJ005734\n\n0\n\nVelocity\n(km s\u22121 )\n\nFlux (10\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121)\n\nQSO\n\nFlux (10\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121)\n\nTable 2.

Mateos et al. (2005) found that the distribution of\nQSO spectral slopes can be described as a Gaussian with\na mean of \u03b1X = 0.98 and a standard deviation \u03c3\u03b1 = 0.21.\nFrom Table 3 we see that when the spectral slopes are\nallowed to vary, the best fit values of \u03b1X for RXJ005734\nand RXJ163308 are relatively close to the mean of the\n\u03b1X distribution. However, the best fit values of \u03b1X for\nRXJ094144, RXJ121803, and RXJ124913 are all unusually low, lying within the lowest 3 percent of the distribution. This is an unlikely circumstance if the intrinsic\nphoton indices of our sample were drawn from the same\ndistribution as QSOs in general, and suggests that the cold\nphotoelectric absorption does not fully account for the unusual X-ray spectral shapes observed in these objects. In\ncomparison, the spectral slopes are fixed in the ionized\nabsorber model, and so are by design consistent with a\ntypical underlying QSO spectrum.\nMoving to \u03b1OX , we have calculated this quantity for\neach of the model fits and each of the QSOs. In each case\nthe restframe 2500 \u00c5 flux has been estimated from the\nB magnitude listed in Page, Mittaz & Carrera (2001), assuming an optical slope of \u03b1O = 0.5. The 2 keV flux is\ndetermined from the continuum model of the X-ray spectral fit, i.e. it is the intrinsic continuum flux, corrected for\nthe modelled X-ray absorption.\nThe\ndistribution\nof\n\u03b1OX\nin\nnormal QSOs is known to depend on luminosity\n(Vignali, Brandt & Schneider, 2003;\nStrateva et al., 2005) and there is inevitably a selection bias depending on whether the sample is X-ray\nor optically selected. The most appropriate reference\ndistribution of \u03b1OX in the literature is that presented in\nStrateva et al. (2005) for a sample of 155 Sloan Digital\nSky Survey QSOs with medium-deep ROSAT coverage.\nHowever, since this distribution is based on an opticallyselected sample, while our sample is X-ray selected, we\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nhave constructed a reference distribution of \u03b1OX for X-ray\nselected QSOs drawn from the ROSAT International\nX-ray Optical Survey (RIXOS; Mason et al., 2000). We\nrestrict the reference sample to those RIXOS QSOs at\nz > 1, which corresponds to a similar luminosity range\nto our X-ray-absorbed QSO sample, because RIXOS\nhas a similar X-ray flux limit to the ROSAT hard\nspectrum survey from which our targets were drawn. We\ncalculated \u03b1OX for the reference sample in an identical\nfashion to our absorbed QSO sample except that we\nassume no intrinsic X-ray absorption and \u03b1X = 0.98\nfor the RIXOS AGN. The reference sample has a mean\nh\u03b1OX i = 1.49 and a standard deviation \u03c3OX = 0.16; the\ndistribution of \u03b1OX for the reference sample is shown in\nFig. 5. For comparison, the SDSS sample presented in\nStrateva et al. (2005) has a very similar distribution of\n\u03b1OX , with h\u03b1OX i = 1.48 and \u03c3OX = 0.18.\nIn Table 3 we see that with the exception of\nRXJ124913, the absorbed QSOs have \u03b1OX values within\ntwo standard deviations of h\u03b1OX i for the reference distribution. For RXJ124913, the level of discrepancy depends\nstrongly on the X-ray spectral model. The ionized absorber fit gives the most consistent \u03b1OX value, at 2.3 standard deviations from the mean of the reference sample,\nwhile the fit with a cold absorber and fitted \u03b1X gives the\nmost discrepant value of \u03b1OX = 1.96, > 2.9 standard deviations from the mean of the reference sample. Indeed, this\nvalue of \u03b1OX is larger than any \u03b1OX in the RIXOS reference sample or the SDSS sample of Strateva et al. (2005),\nsuggesting that the model with a cold absorber and the\ncontinuum slope fitted as a free parameter would also\nrequire a highly unusual spectral energy distribution for\nRXJ124913. While RXJ094144 has rather typical values\nof \u03b1OX in Table 3, we note that if we correct for the intrinsic extinction equivalent to E(B\u2212V)=0.2, suggested by\nthe UV continuum shape (Section 3.1), the \u03b1OX would in-\n\n\f2\u00d710\u22126 5\u00d710\u22126 10\u22125 2\u00d710\u22125\n\nPage, et al.\n\nEFE (keV cm\u22122 s\u22121)\n\n6\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n2\nE (keV)\n\n5\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n2\u00d710\n\n\u22126\n\n5\u00d710\n\n\u22126\n\nRXJ094144 z=1.819\n\n10\n\n\u22126\n\nEFE (keV cm\u22122 s\u22121)\n\n10\n\n\u22125\n\n0.2\n\nRXJ005734 z=2.185\n\n0.2\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n2\nE (keV)\n\ncrease by 0.40, leading to an abnormal \u03b1OX for the cold\nabsorber, fitted \u03b1X model for this source as well as for\nRXJ124913.\nOverall, the ionized absorber model is consistent with\nthe five QSOs having unremarkable underlying X-ray continua and optical to X-ray spectral energy distributions. In\ncontrast, if the X-ray absorbers are modeled as cold gas,\nthe QSOs require a combination of cold absorption, unusual X-ray continua, and unusual optical to X-ray spectral energy distributions. We therefore consider that the\nionized absorber model provides a simpler, less contrived\nsolution than the model in which the X-ray absorber is\ncold. We also note that the presence of C IV absorption\nlines with EW> 5 \u00c5 in the restframe UV spectra of all five\nQSOs (and Si IV in RXJ124913 and RXJ163308) provides\nindependent confirmation that these objects are viewed\nthrough columns of ionized gas.

In the\nnearby Universe, ionized absorbers are common in Seyfert\ngalaxies (e.g. Reynolds, 1997; George et al., 1998), and\nhave been studied in some detail (Blustin et al., 2007;\nSteenbrugge et al., 2005). Therefore in trying to understand the properties of our sample of X-ray absorbed\nQSOs, it is instructive to compare them with those found\nin Seyferts. Amongst Seyfert galaxies, ionized absorption\nis observed primarily in broad-line, (type 1) objects (e.g.\nReynolds, 1997; George et al., 1998; Blustin et al., 2005);\nindicating that the ionized absorbers lie within the ionization cones of the AGN, assuming the standard AGN geometric unification scheme in which the central regions are\nsurrounded by a dusty, obscuring torus (Antonucci, 1993).\nThe presence of ionized absorption within our X-ray absorbed QSOs is therefore in keeping with a normal pole-on\norientation for these objects.\nThe ionized column densities, and the degree of\nsoft X-ray attenuation, of our X-ray absorbed QSOs\nare considerably higher than are found in the majority\nof nearby Seyferts: with the exception of RXJ163308\nfor which the X-ray absorber properties are poorly\nconstrained, all of our sample have best fit log NH\n> 22.5, whereas only 3 of the 23 AGN in the sample\nstudied by Blustin et al. (2005), have log NH > 22.5.\nNonetheless, a few nearby objects such as NGC3783\ndo have comparable column densities and ionization states (Blustin et al., 2002; Netzer et al., 2003;\nReeves et al., 2004; Krongold et al., 2003). The ionized absorbers in Seyferts typically contain ions\ncovering a large range of ionization, and where\ngood data are available they almost always require\nmultiple phases with different ionization parameters to model their spectra (Blustin et al., 2005;\nMcKernan, Yaqoob & Reynolds, 2007).

However, column\ndensities of ionized material similar to those found in our\nsample of X-ray absorbed QSOs are relatively rare, with\nPiconcelli et al (2005) finding that only 2 of their sample\nof 40 nearby QSOs have ionized absorbers with best fit\nlog NH > 22.5. In the small number of nearby QSOs which\nhave well-characterised ionized absorbers with NH >\n1022 cm\u22122 , notably PG 1114+445 (Ashton et al., 2004),\nPDS 456 (Reeves, O'Brien & Ward, 2003), H 0557 \u2212\n385\n(Ashton et al., 2006),\nand\nPG 1211+143\n(Pounds et al., 2003), the absorbers are found to\nhave multiple ionization phases, in common with the\nwell-studied Seyfert warm absorbers.\n\nFigure 5. Reference \u03b1OX distribution for z > 1 RIXOS X-ray\nselected QSOs, as described in Section 3.2.\n\nOn this basis, we can expect that the parameters determined for the single phase absorbers in our sources are\ntherefore likely to be representative only of the dominant\nphase of absorption, and the high-\u03be absorption which we\nhave detected is likely to be accompanied by significant\nsoft X-ray absorption due to material with log \u03be < 1.5. In\nfact the multi-ionization-phase nature of the ionized absorbers is implied by the absorption lines detected in their\nUV spectra. The best fit ionized X-ray absorber models\nfor all 5 objects produce insignificant C IV absorption lines\n(EW < 1 \u00c5), in contrast to the large EW lines (> 5 \u00c5) that\nare measured in their rest-frame UV spectra, implying\nthat at least two ionization phases of absorber are required\nto produce both UV and X-ray absorption. Note that\nwhile absorption from C IV is seen in about half of QSOs\n(Vestergaard, 2003), C IV absorption lines with equivalent\nwidths > 5 \u00c5 are relatively rare. Only 3 out of 114 nonBAL QSOs studied by Vestergaard (2003) show C IV absorption with such large EW. Combined with the statistic that \u223c 15 percent of QSOs have C IV BALs, which\nby definition have C IV EW > 5 \u00c5 (Gibson et al., 2009;\n\nTolea, Krolik & Tsvetanov, 2002) we can conservatively\nestimate the incidence of C IV absorption lines with EW>\n5 \u00c5 to be 20 per cent. The probability of all 5 of our Xray absorbed QSOs having such absorption lines if they\nwere drawn randomly from the population is therefore\n0.25 = 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 , and hence the connection of the C IV\nabsorbers with the X-ray absorption is quite secure.\nOur finding that the X-ray absorbers in our sample are highly ionized allows us to address the puzzling absence of strong UV attenuation by dust, despite the large column densities of X-ray absorbing gas.\nNearby Seyfert 1 galaxies with warm absorbers also show\nthis property: the column densities of X-ray absorbing gas can be large but they have bright ultraviolet\ncontinua with broad emission lines, e.g. NGC 3783 has\nlog NH > 22.5 (Netzer et al., 2003; Reeves et al., 2004) as\nwell as a strong UV continuum and broad UV emission\nlines with little reddening (Crenshaw & Kraemer, 2001;\nEvans & Koratkar, 2004).\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\f8\n\nPage, et al.\n\nAs a corollary to the apparent similarity between the\nionized absorbers found in our X-ray absorbed QSOs and\nsome nearby Seyferts, we might wonder whether star formation is associated with such X-ray absorption in objects\nsuch as NGC 3783, as it is in X-ray absorbed QSOs. A systematic investigation of this issue is beyond the scope of\nthis paper, but it is interesting to note that NGC 3783 has\na 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity of 1.3 \u00d7 1043 ergs s\u22121 and an\ninfrared luminosity of 3 \u00d7 1010 L\u2299 (Mullaney et al., 2011),\nso that if we scaled its SED to match the X-ray luminosities of our X-ray absorbed QSOs its infrared luminosity\nwould be in the regime of ultraluminous infrared galaxies,\ncommensurate with a substantial star formation rate.\n\n4.2\n\nComparison to soft X-ray weak QSOs\n\nIt is interesting to compare the X-ray absorbed QSOs with\nanother population of unusual QSOs: those that are classified as soft X-ray weak. These objects are characterised by\nlarge values of \u03b1ox , and represent around 10% of optically\nselected QSOs (Laor et al., 1997). Brandt et al. (2000)\nfound a strong correlation between \u03b1ox and the equivalent\nwidth of C IV absorption, which is found to be > 4\u00c5\nin the majority of soft X-ray weak QSOs. This was\ninterpreted by Brandt et al. (2000) as evidence that soft\nX-ray weak QSOs are such because they are absorbed\nin the soft X-ray band. As shown in Section 3.1, the\nQSOs in our sample all have C IV absorption lines with\nEW> 4\u00c5, similar to the C IV lines found in soft X-ray\nweak QSOs. More recently, XMM-Newton observations of\nsoft X-ray weak QSOs have indicated that this absorption\nis primarily due to ionized gas (Schartel et al., 2005;\nBrinkmann, Papadakis & Ferrero, 2004;\nPiconcelli, Jim\u00e9nez-Bail\u00f3n & Guainazzi, 2004), with ionization parameters ranging from log \u03be = 1.9 to log \u03be = 3.2\nand column densities ranging from 3 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 to\n2 \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122 . These column densities and ionization\nparameters are remarkably similar to those of our X-ray\nabsorbed QSOs. Given these similarities, we might expect\nthat intense star formation would be as common in soft\nX-ray weak QSOs as it is in X-ray absorbed QSOs. To\nour knowledge there has been no systematic study of the\nstar formation rates in soft X-ray weak QSOs, but there\nare certainly well known examples of soft X-ray weak\nQSOs which are rapidly forming stars, notably Mrk 231\nand IRAS 07598 + 6508 (Lipari, 1994).\n\n4.3\n\nLocation of the absorbers\n\nWe now consider the location, physical nature, and implications of the ionized absorbers found in our sample. To\nestimate the location we assume that the absorber is in\nthe form of an outflowing wind originating at a distance\nRabs from the continuum source with density n \u221d r \u22122 .\nFrom the definition of the ionization parameter\n\u03be = Lion /(nr 2 )\n(1)\nwhere Lion is the 1-1000 Rydberg ionizing luminosity in\nerg s\u22121 , such a wind will have an ionization parameter \u03be\nthat is constant with radius r. To take account that the\nwinds from AGN are likely to be clumpy or filamentary, we\ncharacterise the outflow with a macroscopic volume filling\n\nfactor f < 1. The column density of the absorber is dominated by material close to the base of the outflow, and\nhence Rabs can be taken as the characteristic distance of\nthe absorber from the continuum source. Integrating the\ndensity along the line of sight, we obtain NH = f Rabs nabs\nwhere nabs is the density at the base of the outflow. Substituting nabs for n in Equation 1, we obtain the relation\nRabs =\n\nLion f\n\u03beNH\n\n(2)\n\nTo estimate Lion we assume that below 0.35\nkeV the SED has the functional form given by\nMathews & Ferland (1987) for a QSO ionizing spectrum, in which the X-ray power law steepens to \u03b1 = 3\nin the range 56\u2013350 eV, has a slope of \u03b1 = 1.0 in the\n24\u201356 eV range, below which it has a slope of \u03b1O = 0.5.\nThis SED of Mathews & Ferland (1987) was constructed\nto be appropriate for objects of QSO luminosity, and\nwhen joined to our \u03b1X =0.98 spectrum at 0.35 keV it has\n\u03b1OX = 1.47.\nFor the fixed \u03b1X =0.98 which we have taken in our\nionized absorber model fits, Lion is a factor of 44.3 times\nlarger than the restframe 2-10 keV luminosity. For the filling factor f we assume a value of log f = \u22122, which is\nthe average log f for ionized absorbers with \u03be > 0.7 in\nSeyfert galaxies found by Ashton et al. (2006). The derived values of Lion and Rabs are given in Table 4. With\nthe exception of RXJ163308, for which Rabs is very poorly\nconstrained, the best fit values of Rabs range from 1 to 15\nparsecs. The uncertainties given for Rabs are derived from\nthe statistical uncertainties on the product \u03be \u00d7 NH , and so\ndo not include the uncertainty on the volume filling factor. As an estimate of this additional uncertainty, we note\nthat Ashton et al. (2006) obtained a standard deviation\nin log f of 0.8 for Seyfert warm absorbers with \u03be > 0.7.\nFor comparison, we also provide in Table 4 the locations\nof the inner edge of the dusty torus Rtorus for our sources,\ncalculated using equation 5 from Barvainis (1987), with\na dust sublimation temperature of 1260 K (as implied\nby the composite near-IR QSO spectrum obtained by\nGlikman, Helfand & White, 2006) and taking the ultraviolet luminosity to be equal to Lion . We see that Rabs is\nin all cases smaller than, or consistent with, Rtorus .\nIt would therefore be natural to assume that the absorbers originate in the AGN themselves, rather than in\ntheir host galaxies. This solution is attractive, because it\nis compatible with the lack of optical extinction in these\nobjects: if the absorber is driven as a wind, either from\nthe accretion disc or from evaporation of the inner edge\nof the molecular torus, then dust will be sublimated before (or as) it enters the flow. With this in mind, it is\ninstructive to obtain upper limits for the distance of the\nabsorbing gas from the nucleus at which it could remain\nionized by the AGN radiation field, using Equation 2 and\ntaking the limit case of filling factor f = 1. Doing so, we\nfind that the X-ray absorbers in RXJ094144, RXJ121803\nand RXJ124913 must lie within a few hundred parsecs of\nthe ionizing source, within or close to the AGN rather than\nbeing distributed throughout the host galaxy.\nA key indicator of the importance of an ionized AGN\nwind is the ratio of the mass outflow rate \u1e40out to the\naccretion rate \u1e40acc . To determine this ratio, we first take\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fThe nature of X-ray absorbed QSOs\nTable 4.

Lion is the 1-1000 Rydberg ionizing\nluminosity in erg s\u22121 , Rabs is the distance of the base of the\nabsorber from the continuum source in cm, Rtorus is the distance of the inner edge of the dusty torus from the continuum\nsource in cm, \u1e40acc is the mass accretion rate and \u1e40out is the\nmass outflow rate in the ionized absorber. An '\u2217' indicates a\nconfidence limit that is not constrained by the data. Note that\nthe uncertainties are purely statistical, and do not include the\nsystematic uncertainty on the filling factor f , on which both\nRabs and \u1e40out depend linearly.

Combining\nequations 3 and 4 we obtain:\n\u1e40out /\u1e40acc = 0.74mp f v\u03a9\u01ebc2 /\u03be\n(5)\nWe take \u01eb = 0.1 and as before we assume f = 0.01.\nWe take the opening angle of the outflow \u03a9 = \u03c0 steradians, corresponding to the opening angle of the torus inferred from the type 1 / type 2 number ratio in nearby\nSeyferts (Maiolino & Rieke, 1995). For the velocity v we\nassume that the X-ray absorbing ionized outflow is associated with the fastest outflow identified in the restframe\nultraviolet (Table 2). This is a reasonable estimate, since\nthe highest ionization absorbers are typically (though not\nalways) the highest velocity systems in individual Seyfert\ngalaxies (e.g. Sako et al., 2003; Steenbrugge et al., 2005;\nCostantini et al., 2007). At the same time it is a conservative estimate (i.e. may underestimate the mass outflow\nrate) for two reasons: firstly, the signal to noise ratios\nof our optical spectra (particularly for RXJ094144 and\nRXJ121803) are not high enough that we can be confident we have identified all of the absorption line systems,\nand secondly our estimates of the systemic velocities are\nbased on the UV broad emission lines, which themselves\nare frequently observed to have a net outflow velocity of\norder 1000 km s\u22121 (Espey et al., 1989). The derived values of log \u1e40out /\u1e40acc are listed in Table 4. In the case of\nRXJ094144, the C IV absorption line that is identified in\nthe rest-frame UV spectrum is redshifted with respect to\nthe UV emission lines, so its true velocity with respect to\nthe system is too uncertain for us to attempt to estimate\nthe mass outflow rate. The mass outflow rates derived\nfor RXJ005734, RXJ124913 and RXJ163308 are about 10\ntimes their mass accretion rates, while in RXJ121803 the\naccretion and outflow rates are comparable.\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n4.4\n\n9\n\nImplications for QSO evolution\n\nAt this point it is worth considering how these results bear on the broader picture of how X-ray absorbed QSOs relate to the evolution of massive black\nholes and their host galaxies. In Page et al. (2004) we\nargued that the submillimetre properties of X-ray absorbed QSOs imply an evolutionary sequence in which\nsubmillimetre galaxies evolve into QSOs, with the X-ray\nabsorbed QSOs representing a brief, transitional phase\nbetween these two stages. The discovery that submillimetre galaxies typically contain more heavily absorbed,\nlower luminosity AGN than X-ray absorbed QSOs, supports this evolutionary picture (Alexander et al., 2005).\nIn Stevens et al. (2005) we further proposed that the Xray absorbed QSOs are in the process of driving the interstellar media out of their host galaxies via radiatively\ndriven winds, in accord with the models developed by\nSilk & Rees (1998), Fabian (1999), Granato et al. (2004)\nand Di Matteo, Springel & Hernquist (2005). Now, with\nour XMM-Newton observations we have shown that the\nX-ray absorption in these objects is indeed due to substantial, ionized, QSO-driven winds. The space density\nof X-ray absorbed QSOs is \u223c 15 per cent that of unabsorbed QSOs (Page et al., 2004; Silverman et al., 2005;\nPage et al., 2006), implying that if all QSOs go through\nan X-ray absorbed phase in their evolution, this phase\nlasts only \u223c 15 per cent as long as the unabsorbed phase.\nThese relative lifetimes may be a natural consequence of\nthe high mass outflow rates in the X-ray absorbed QSOs:\nfor the majority of our X-ray absorbed QSOs we estimate\na mass outflow rate which is \u223c 10 times higher than the\naccretion rate, implying that the fuel supply will be depleted 10 times faster in an X-ray absorbed QSO than in\nan unabsorbed QSO for the same accretion rate and fuel\nreservoir. However, this argument is more complicated if\nthe two types of QSO fit within the evolutionary sequence\ndiscussed above, because in this case the fuel supply for an\nunabsorbed QSO will consist only of the fuel that remains\nafter the X-ray absorbed phase. Nonetheless, if material is\nejected at \u223c 10 times the accretion rate for \u223c 15 per cent\nof the (X-ray absorbed + unabsorbed) QSO lifetime, the\ntotal mass of material ejected by the QSO will be of the\nsame order as that accreted.\nThe origin of the ionized, absorbing gas is then a fundamental issue for the physics of X-ray absorbed QSOs\nand their evolution. Assuming that X-ray absorbed QSOs\nhave the usual AGN structure envisaged in geometric unification schemes, the two obvious sources of material are\nthe accretion disc and the dusty torus. If the wind is\ndriven from the accretion disc, the ejected material must\npass through the accretion disc during the X-ray absorbed\nphase; in this case it is difficult to understand why this\nhappens on a timescale which is short compared to the\nlifetime of the QSO. On the other hand, if the ionized\nwind is driven from the torus then the timescale for the\nX-ray absorbed phase corresponds to the time required to\nerode the inner part of the torus and so enlarge substantially its opening angle; as shown by Krolik & Kriss (2001)\nthis timescale can be much shorter than the lifetime of the\nQSO. For accretion at the Eddington rate, the escape velocities at the distances of the inner edge of the torus (as\ngiven in Table 4) are between 900 and 1500 km s\u22121 , and\n\n\f10\n\nPage, et al.\n\nscale inversely with the square root of the accretion rate in\nEddington units. Hence, of our X-ray absorbed QSOs, only\nthe BALQSO RXJ124913 has outflow velocities which are\ntoo high to plausibly be associated with an outflow from\nthe inner edge of the torus, implying an accretion disc\norigin for its outflow.\nViable AGN feedback models which reproduce\nthe M \u2212 \u03c3 relation generally incorporate the feedback in the form of kinetic energy given to gas\nwithin the immediate (\u223c100 pc) environment of\nthe AGN (e.g.\nFabian, 1999; Granato et al., 2004;\nDi Matteo, Springel & Hernquist, 2005;\nHopkins et al., 2006; Sijacki et al., 2007), which then\ninteracts with gas on a larger scale to terminate star\nformation in the host spheroid. It is generally agreed that\nof order 5 per cent of the AGN radiative output must\nbe fed back as kinetic energy in order for the models\nto succeed (Silk & Rees, 1998; Wyithe & Loeb, 2003;\nDi Matteo, Springel & Hernquist, 2005). We can make\na simple estimate for the kinetic energy of the outflows\ncompared to the radiative output of the X-ray absorbed\nQSOs as follows. We take the total energy radiated during\nthe X-ray absorbed phase to be ET = \u01ebMacc c2 where \u01eb is\nthe radiative efficiency, c is the speed of light and Macc is\nthe mass accreted during the X-ray absorbed phase. The\nkinetic energy built up by the outflow is EO = 0.5Mout v 2\nwhere Mout is the mass supplied to the outflow during\nthe X-ray absorbed phase and v is the velocity of the\noutflow. The fraction of the radiated output of the QSO\nwhich is fed back to the surrounding gas as kinetic energy\nof the outflow is then\nEO\n0.5\nv2\nMout\n=\n\u00d7 2\n\u00d7\n(6)\nET\n\u01eb\nMacc\nc\nIf we take Mout /Macc =\u1e40out /\u1e40acc \u223c 10 for the X-ray\nabsorbed phase (as we find for the majority of our X-ray\nabsorbed QSOs), and a typical outflow velocity of 8000\nkm s\u22121 (see Table 2), we obtain EO /ET \u223c 4 per cent. The\nvalue of EO /ET so derived is independent of the radiative\nefficiency \u01eb, because the \u01eb in Equation 6 cancels with that\nin Equation 5 from which \u1e40out /\u1e40acc is obtained. On the\nother hand, the uncertainty on \u1e40out /\u1e40acc is in truth very\nlarge (> a factor of 10), depending on the unknown filling\nfactor f , and the square of the outflow velocity v, which\nmay not be the same for the X-ray absorbing phase as the\nUV absorber. Nonetheless, EO /ET \u223c 4 per cent is quite\nconsistent with the level of feedback required to terminate\nstar formation and produce the M \u2212 \u03c3 relation, implying\nthat the ionized outflows in X-ray absorbed QSOs could\nplausibly be the mechanism through which star formation\nis terminated in massive galaxies.\n\n5\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented X-ray spectra from XMM-Newton\nEPIC and rest-frame ultraviolet spectra from groundbased telescopes for five X-ray absorbed, submillimetreluminous QSOs. All five QSOs exhibit strong C IV absorption lines in their ultraviolet spectra with equivalent\nwidth > 5\u00c5. The X-ray spectra can be modelled successfully in terms of \u03c72 with either cold or ionized absorbers.\nThe cold X-ray absorber model requires that the QSOs\n\nhave unusually flat X-ray continuum shapes and unusual\noptical to X-ray spectral energy distributions, while the\nionized absorber model does not require abnormal underlying continuum properties. This finding, coupled with the\npresence of strong C IV absorption lines in the UV leads\nus to favour the ionized absorber model over the cold absorber model. Assuming that the X-ray absorbing gas is\noutflowing with the same velocities as the C IV absorbers,\nwe are able to investigate the likely location, mass outflow\nrates and energetics of the ionized absorbers. We find that\nthe X-ray absorbing gas is likely to be located within 10 pc\nof the continuum source, and so is associated with the\nactive nucleus rather than the surrounding host galaxy's\ninterstellar medium. We estimate that the fraction of radiated power that is converted into kinetic luminosity of the\noutflowing winds is typically \u223c 4 per cent, in agreement\nwith estimates for the kinetic feedback from QSOs that\nis required to produce the M \u2212 \u03c3 relation. This finding is\nthus consistent with the hypothesis that X-ray absorbed\nQSOs represent the transition phase between obscured accretion and the luminous QSO phase in the evolution of\nmassive galaxies.\n\n6\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nBased on observations obtained with XMM-Newton, an\nESA science mission with instruments and contributions\ndirectly funded by ESA Member States and NASA.
