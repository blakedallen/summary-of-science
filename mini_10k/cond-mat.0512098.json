Introduction\nThe discovery of high-temperature superconductors and other related oxide based materials\nhave attracted a lot of attention regarding the unique properties of low dimensional solids. The\nsimplest and more notorious representation of a one-dimensional (1d) conductor is the the socalled Tomonaga-Luttinger (TL) model[1]. That model essentially describes 1d electrons in the\nvicinity of their right and left Fermi points interacting with each other by means of forward\nscattering processes. Due to the special equivalence relations between bosons and fermions\nand left and right charge conservation laws the TL model can be solved exactly by either\nbosonization[2] or, making full use of the Ward identities, by quantum field theory methods[3].\nThe one-particle Green's function for the TL model can also be calculated exactly by those\nmethods. However such a direct solution is provided only in coordinate space. To obtain the\nassociated spectral function which determines the photoemission and the inverse photoemission\nspectra one needs to evaluate an intricate double Fourier transform and perform numerical\napproximations[4].\nBosonization methods are hard to implement in higher dimensions[5]. In addition, those\nWard identities simplifications are inherent to 1d and to the exact number conservation of right\n(+) and left (-) particles. As a result to deal with strongly correlated fermions in two or more\nspatial dimensions one generally resorts to other schemes. One of those alternative approaches\nis the renormalization group (RG) method. RG methods were used with success to predict the\nvarious instabilities of the 1d electron gas as a function of the existing coupling parameters[6].\nThe RG flows of the renormalized couplings are also in agreement with the bosonization solutions\nin several related problems. Despite that the RG method is not frequently used to perform a\n\n\fdirect calculation of the single-particle Green's function and its associated spectral function[7, 8].\nSince in the TL model there are only low-energy bosonic spin and charge collective modes it is\nnot clear that the right physics will emerge out of approximate fermionic RG schemes. Besides,\nit is also fair to say that RG methods have not yet been proved capable of dealing, in full\nforce, with spin-charge separation effects. Within the g-ology framework the role of the forward\ncoupling g4 has not been fully explored in the RG context so far. One should therefore try to\nestablish how to deal with spin-charge effects in well known grounds, such as the TL model,\nbefore implementing RG methods in more difficult problems such as spin-charge separated states\nin higher spatial dimensions.\nIn this work we apply the field theoretical RG method[9] to describe the TL model in detail.\nThis work is not intended to review exhaustively all the different RG applications for the TLM.\nWe refer the reader to several authoritative review articles for that purpose[10]. Rather we\nconcentrate here uniquely on the field theoretical RG description of the TLM. Using this scheme\nwe derive the flow equations for the forward couplings g2R and g4R up to two-loop order. In\n(4)\n(4)\ncalculating the respective renormalized one-particle irreducible functions \u03932R and \u03934R we show\nthat non-parquet vertex contributions are the only source of logarithmic divergences in our\nperturbative calculations. Taking into account the self-energy corrections calculated earlier we\ndemonstrate that, in two-loop order, the non-flow condition for g2R and g4R is assured by the\nexact cancelation produced by the contributions originated by the anomalous dimension and by\nthe counterterms added to our renormalized TL Lagrangian. Based on our perturbative RG\nresults we construct and solve the Callan-Symanzik equation for the renormalized one-particle\nGreen's function GR at the Fermi points. We show that it correctly possesses a branch cut\nstructure due to its non trivial anomalous dimension. Using GR we derive the spectral function\nand the momentum distribution function at the Fermi points. Our results are in agreement with\nearlier bosonization work[4] as well as more recent RG estimates[9]. Using a momentum RG\n(2)\nscale parameter we use perturbation theory to derive \u0393R = G\u22121\nR at the Fermi energy p0 = 0\nand in the vicinity of p = \u00b1kF . One important feature emerges naturally from our result. There\nare now two emergent characteristic velocities which we relate immediately to the spin-charge\n(2)\nseparation effects. Moreover, the general form of the resulting \u0393R is in qualitative agreement\nwith the Dzyaloshinskii and Larkin's Ward identity solution(DL)[3]. Our estimates are entirely\nperturbative since at that stage we only consider contributions up to two-loop order. To go\nbeyond perturbation theory we relate the effective two-particle propagators D+\u2212 and D++ ,\n(4)\n(4)\nintroduced earlier by DL, to \u03932R and \u03934R and show how to implement the regularization, up\nto infinite order, of all the divergences which are originated in the perturbation series for these\ntwo one-particle irreducible functions.\nRecently new versions of the functional RG containing both fermionic and auxiliary bosonic\nfields have been developed with success[14, 15]. In one of those[14], the Ward identities are also\nused to truncate the vertex functions hierarchical equations and as a result they are able to\nreproduce the correct TL spectral function at the Fermi points for the case in which g 4 = 0.\n2. The TL Lagrangian Model\nFollowing the so-called g-ology convention the renormalized TL fermionic lagrangian is given by\nLT L =\n\nX\n\np,a=\u00b1,\u03c3\n\n\u2212\n\nX\n\np1 p2 p3\n\u03c31 ,\u03c32\n\n\u2020\n(1 + \u2206Z)\u03c8R(a)\u03c3\n(p, t)(i\u2202t \u2212 vF (|p| \u2212 kF ))\u03c8R(a)\u03c3 (p, t)\n\n\u2020\n\u2020\n(p1 + p2 \u2212 p3 , t)\u03c8R(\u2212)\u03c32 (p2 , t)\u03c8R(+)\u03c31 (p1 , t)\n(p3 , t)\u03c8R(\u2212)\u03c3\n(g2R + \u2206g2R )\u03c8R(+)\u03c3\n2\n1\n\n\fFigure 1. The direct renormalized couplings.\n\n\u2212\n\n1 X\n\u2020\n\u2020\n(g4R + \u2206g4R )\u03c8R(a)\u03c3\n(p3 , t)\u03c8R(a)\u03c3\n(p1 + p2 \u2212 p3 , t)\u03c8R(a)\u03c32 (p2 , t)\u03c8R(a)\u03c31 (p1 , t),(1)\n1\n2\n2 p1 p2 p3\n\u03c31 ,\u03c32 ,a\n\nwhere the momentum p is restricted to the interval \u2212\u03bb \u2264 |p| \u2212 kF \u2264 \u03bb in the vicinities of the\nright and left Fermi points and \u2206Z = Z \u2212 1. In Figure 1 we display the direct couplings g2R\nand g4R . For practical purposes we can also take the limit \u03bb \u2192 \u221e. We assume beforehand\nthat neither the Fermi velocity nor the Fermi momentum are renormalized by interactions. The\nquasiparticle weight Z is nullified by interactions at the Fermi points since there are no stable\nquasiparticles in the TL regime but we assume tactically that we don't know this a priori. In\ngeneral Z is the multiplicative factor which relate the bare and the renormalized fermion fields\nto each other. The counterterms associated with the contributions from \u2206g2R and \u2206g4R are\nincluded to regularize the logarithmic divergences which arise in perturbation theory.\nThe corresponding right and left non-interacting Green's functions of this model are simply\n(0)\niG(+) (p, p0 )\n\nand\n(0)\n\n\u03b8 (kF \u2212 p)\n\u03b8 (p \u2212 kF )\n+\n=i\np0 \u2212 vF (p \u2212 kF ) + i\u03b4 p0 \u2212 vF (p \u2212 kF ) \u2212 i\u03b4\n\n\u0015\n\n(2)\n\n\u03b8 ((p + kF ))\n\u03b8 (\u2212 (p + kF ))\n+\np0 + vF (p + kF ) + i\u03b4 p0 + vF (p + kF ) \u2212 i\u03b4\n\n\u0015\n\n(3)\n\niG(\u2212) (p, p0 ) = i\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0014\n\nFigure 2. The non-interacting Green's functions.\nUsing the appropriate Feynman rules for LT L we can now proceed with the perturbative\n(4)\n(4)\n(2)\ncalculations of the one-particle irreducible functions \u03932R , \u03934R and \u03932R . In general, following the\nrenormalization theory, we can relate those functions at the Fermi points to observable physical\nquantities.\nDue to the fact that only forward scattering processes are accounted for in LT L the right (+)\nand left (\u2212) lines never mix in a single loop. As a result in this way no divergence arises from\nnon-interacting particle-hole loop diagrams. Taking into account the spin summation factors we\nfind instead\n(0)\n\u03a0(+) (q, q0 )\n\n\u03b8 (\u2212q)\n\u03b8 (q)\niq\n+\n=\n\u03c0 q0 \u2212 vF q + i\u03b4 q0 \u2212 vF q \u2212 i\u03b4\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(4)\n\n\fand\n(0)\n\n\u03a0(\u2212) (q, q0 ) = \u2212\n\niq\n\u03b8 (q)\n\u03b8 (\u2212q)\n+\n\u03c0 q0 + vF q + i\u03b4 q0 + vF q \u2212 i\u03b4\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(5)\n\nThese \u03a0(0) 's reduce simply to \u2212i/\u03c0vF at the Fermi points if we take the limits q0 \u2192 0 and\nq \u2192 0.\n\nFigure 3. The non-interacting particle-hole bubbles.\nAnother important feature due to the neglect of backscattering processes is that the\nsymmetrized sums of all diagrams containing closed loops with more than two fermion lines\nvanish exactly[3]. Thanks to this important simplification there are only divergent diagrams in\n(4)\n(4)\nthe perturbative series expansions for both \u03932R and \u03934R in two-loop order. Those divergences,\nwhich are precisely the object of attention of renormalization theory, are cancelled out exactly by\nthe counterterms added to the Lagrangian model. However at this order of perturbation theory\nwe are also obliged to take into account self-energy corrections.

Flow Equations for the Renormalized Couplings\nFollowing the renormalization theory we can relate the physical couplings g2R and g4R to the(4)\n(4)\nparticle irreducible functions \u03932R and \u03934R at the Fermi points. In this way for the external\nmomenta p1 = p3 = kF , p2 = \u2212kF and p10 = p20 = p30 = \u03c9/2 \u2248 0 we define\n(4)\n\n\u03932R (p1 = kF , p2 = \u2212kF ; p1 + p2 \u2212 p3 = \u2212kF , p3 = kF ; p10 = p20 = p30 = \u03c9/2; \u03c9) = \u2212ig2R (\u03c9)\n(15)\n\n\fFigure 5.

[13].\n\u03b22 (\u03c9) = \u03c9\n\n5. RG Calculation of the One-Particle Green's Function at the Fermi Points\nAs we saw in the previous section the TL liquid is characterized by the non-flow of the\nrenormalized forward couplings. This simplifies the RG approach to this problem. In this\nscheme we relate, quite generically, the renormalized Green's function GR to its bare analogue\nGB by\nG(a)R (p, p0 ; g2R ; g4R ; \u03c9) = Z \u22121 (\u03c9) G(a)B (p, p0 ; g2B ; g4B )\n\n(23)\n\nSince GB is independent of the RG scale \u03c9 we derive the Callan-Symanzik equation (CZE)[16]\ndifferentiating G(a)B with respect to \u03c9. Taking into account that the giR 's don't flow , in the\nvicinity of the Fermi points, for p = \u00b1kF , the CZE reduces to\n\u0012\n\n\u03c9\n\n\u2202\n+ \u03b3 G(a)R (p = \u00b1kF , p0 ; \u03c9) = 0\n\u2202\u03c9\n\u0013\n\n(24)\n\nSince G(a)R has ordinary dimension of (energy)\u22121 , on dimensional grounds we have that\n\u0012\n\n\u03c9\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+ p0\nG(a)R (p = \u00b1kF , p0 ; \u03c9) = \u2212G(a)R (p = \u00b1kF , p0 ; \u03c9)\n\u2202\u03c9\n\u2202p0\n\u0013\n\n(25)\n\n\fWe can use this to rewrite the CZE in the form\n\u0012\n\np0\n\n\u2202\n+ 1 \u2212 \u03b3 G(a)R (p = \u00b1kF , p0 ; \u03c9) = 0\n\u2202p0\n\u0013\n\n(26)\n\nConsidering that the anomalous dimension \u03b3 is constant, this equation can be easily\nintegrated to give\nG(a)R (p = \u00b1kF , p0 ; \u03c9) =\n\n1\n\u03c9\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c9\np0 + i\u03b4\n\n\u00131\u2212\u03b3\n\n(27)\n\nwhich has indeed a branch cut structure as opposed to the simple pole nature, typical of the\nFermi liquid one-particle Green's function. Consequently, for p0 \u2264 0, at the Fermi points,\nG(a)R (p = \u00b1kF , p0 ; \u03c9) = \u2212\n\n1\n\u03c9\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c9\n|p0 |\n\n\u00131\u2212\u03b3\n\n(cos \u03c0\u03b3 + i sin \u03c0\u03b3)\n\n(28)\n\nIt follows from this that the spectral function A(a)R (p = \u00b1kF , p0 ; \u03c9) reduces to\nA(a)R (p = \u00b1kF , p0 ; \u03c9) = \u03b8 (\u2212p0 )\n\n\u0012\n\n|p0 |\n\u03c9\n\n\u0013\u03b3\n\nsin \u03c0\u03b3\n|p0 |\n\n(29)\n\nThis result is in agreement with earlier RG estimates of Kopietz and coworkers[8]. To calculate\nnext the momentum distribution function n (p = \u00b1kF ) at the FPs, it suffices to integrate A(a)R\nover an energy interval of width 2\u03c9 around p0 = 0. We find\nn (p = \u00b1kF ) =\n\nsin \u03c0\u03b3\n2\u03c0\u03b3\n\n(30)\n\nwhich reduces to n (\u00b1kF ) = 1/2 in the limit \u03b3 \u2192 0.\nLet us now consider the alternative limit p0 = 0 and \u2206p = \u039b \u2248 0 where the parameter \u039b is\nnow our RG momentum scale which will be used to take the physical system towards the FPs.\n(4)\nIf we repeat our RG analysis for \u0393iR making use of such RG scale we find at the FPs\n\u2206giR (\u03c9) = \u2212\n\n2\u03bb\ngiR (\u03c9) g 22R (\u03c9)\nln\n2\n2\u03c0\n\u039b\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(31)\n\nSince the forward couplings don't flow in the TL we can determine the corresponding Z (\u039b)\ntaking into account that we must have as before\n2\u03b3\u039b giR = \u039b\n\ngiR (\u03c9) g 22R (\u03c9)\nd\u2206giR\n=\nd\u039b\n2\u03c0 2\n\n(32)\n\nConsequently,\n\u039b\n\nd ln Z (\u039b)\n= \u03b3\u039b = \u03b3\nd\u039b\n\n(33)\n\nand again we have that\nZ (\u039b) = Z (2\u03bb)\n\n\u0012\n\n\u039b\n2\u03bb\n\n\u0013\u03b3\n\n\u21920\n\n(34)\n\nas \u039b \u2192 0 for \u03b3 > 0, which is consistent with the fact that there are no quasiparticles at the FPs.\n(2)\nInvoking once again the RG condition between the bare and renormalized \u0393(+) 's we write\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n\u0393(+)R (p, p0 = 0; \u039b) = Z (\u039b) \u0393(+)B (p, p0 = 0)\n\n(35)\n\n\fIn the weak coupling limit in a regime consistent with our perturbative two-loop results Z (\u039b)\nreduces to\nZ (\u039b) = 1 + \u03b3 ln\n\n\u0012\n\n\u039b\n2\u03bb\n\nCombining this with our earlier results produces\n(2)\n\u0393(+)B\n\n\"\n\n(p, p0 = 0) = \u2212vF \u2206p 1 +\n\n\u0012\n\ng2R\n2\u03c0\n\n\u0013\n\n\u00132\n\n+ ...\n\n(36)\n\n2\u03bb\nln\n\u2206p\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0012\n\ng4R\n\u221a\n2\u03c0 2\n\n\u00132 #\n\n(37)\n\nConsequently in the vicinities of the FPs\n\uf8ee\n\nwith\n\nuc us \u2206p \uf8f0\n(2)\n\u0393(+)R (p, p0 = 0; \u039b) = \u2212\n1+\nvF\nuc = vF\n\n\u0012\n\ng2R\n\u221a\n2\u03c0 uc us\n\n|g |\n\u221a\n1 + 4R\n2\u03c0 2\n\n!2\n\n\uf8f9\n\u0013\n\n\u039b \uf8fb\nln\n,\n\u2206p\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(38)\n\n(39)\n\nand\n|g 4R |\n\u221a\n(40)\n2\u03c0 2\nThe presence of two different velocities violates the single-pole character of the one-particle\nGreen's function and it is directly related to the spin-charge separation which takes place in the\nTLM[17]. This spin-charge separation is a feature which emerges naturally from our perturbative\n\u221a\n(2)\nRG analysis. Notice that up to order O(g 22R ), in the weak coupling limit, vF \u2248 uc us and \u0393(+)R\nreduces to\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nus = vF 1 \u2212\n\n(2)\n\u0393(+)R (p, p0\n\n1\n2\n\n= 0; \u039b) \u2248 \u2212 (uc \u2206p) (us \u2206p)\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u039b\n\u2206p\n\n\u0013\u03b3\n\n(41)\n\nwhich is in qualitative agreement with well-known results[18]. However, our estimates for uc and\nus are only valid up to two-loop order. For this reason they cannot be identical to the velocities\nobtained from the solutions of Schwinger-Dyson equations which include contributions up to\ninfinite order[3].\n6. Ward Identities\nAs demonstrated by Dzyaloshinskii and Larkin[3] the use of Ward identities greatly simplifies\nthe analysis of the TL model. Making use of these identities and taking into account the\nsimplifications produced by the cancelation of the symmetrized sum of all diagrams containing\nclosed loops with more than two fermion lines we are naturally led, following DL, to introduce\ntwo interactions propagators D++ and D+\u2212 . These two propagators can be used to describe the\neffective two-particle interactions in the TLM. D++ and D+\u2212 are finite at the FPs and do not\nneed to undergo any regularization procedure. In contrast with that, as we discussed in section\n(4)\n(4)\n4, the one-particle irreducible functions \u03932R and \u03934R produce non-parquet vertex contributions\nwhich need to be regularized order by order in perturbation series. Therefore to relate the DL\ninteraction propagators back to the corresponding one-particle irreducible functions we must\ninclude appropriate vertex functions. Considering these feature we can readily extend our\n(4)\n(4)\nperturbative results writing the exact one-particle irreducible functions \u03932R and \u03934R in the\nform\n\n\f(4)\n\n\u03932R (p1 , p2 , p1 + p2 \u2212 p3 , p3 ) =\n\n\u0393R\n+ (p3 , p1 , p3 \u2212 p1 )iD+\u2212 (p1 \u2212 p3 )\n.\u0393R\n\u2212 (p1 + p2 \u2212 p3 , p3 , p1 \u2212 p3 )\n\n(42)\n\nand\n(4)\n\n\u03934R (p1 , p2 , p1 + p2 \u2212 p3 , p3 ) =\n\n\u0393R\n+ (p1 , p3 , p3 \u2212 p1 )iD++ (p1 \u2212 p3 )\n.\u0393R\n+ (p1 + p2 \u2212 p3 , p2 , p1 \u2212 p3 )\n\n(43)\n\n(4)\n\nThese \u0393iR 's are represented diagrammatically in Figure 8. Thanks to the already mentioned\nsimplification inherent to the TLM, the propagators D+\u2212 and D++ are determined exactly by\nsolving the Schwinger-Dyson equations indicated in Figures 9 and 10. Solving these SDE's for\nD++ and D+\u2212 , diagrammatically,\np we arrive immediately at the DL results for the charge and\nspin velocities, namely, uc = vF (1 + g 4R /\u03c0)2 \u2212 (g 2R /\u03c0)2 and us = vF .\nSince the interaction propagators are independent of renormalization parameters they are RG\ninvariants. In contrast the vertex functions \u0393's produce logarithmic singularities which need to\nbe cancelled out by appropriate counterterms. As we showed before, in the RG framework, we\nsolve this problem either by relating the bare and renormalized vertices to each other through\nrelations of the type\nB\nB\n\u0393R\na = Z2 \u0393a = (1 + \u2206Z2 ) \u0393a\n\n(44)\n\nwith a = +, \u2212, or by constructing the necessary counterterm directly, order by order in\nperturbation theory. Following this latter route, up to two-loop order the renormalized vertex\nfunction \u0393R\na is determined by the diagrams shown in Figure (11).\nR\nIf we define \u0393R\na such that \u0393a F P = 1 it then follows that the vertex counterterm diagram\nwhich appears in Figure (12) is determined exactly by this condition.\nThis gives\n\n(4)\n\n(4)\n\nFigure 8. The exact one-particle irreducible functions \u03932R and \u03934R .\n\n\fFigure 9.

[12]. In fact, since the Ward identity(WI) is\npreserved by the renormalization process, this result emerges naturally from the WI itself. As a\nconsequence of this simplification, at the FPs, the renormalized one-particle irreducible functions\n(4)\n(4)\n\u03932R and \u03934R reduce simply to the interaction propagators iD+\u2212 and iD++ respectively, which\nby being RG invariants, produce vanishing beta functions to all orders in perturbation theory\nin agreement with the rigorous analysis of Ref. [13].\n7. Conclusion\nWe implement the field theoretical RG method in the presence of spin-charge separation effects\nin one spatial dimension. We take the Tomonaga-Luttinger model as our reference test ground\nin dealing with future higher dimensional problems. As is well known trhe TLM was solved\nby bosonization and by quantum field theoretical methods which take into explicit account the\nsimplifications produced by the Ward identities. Unfortunately those simplifications are inherent\nto one dimension and contrary to the RG scheme both methods are difficult to implement in\nmore general situations.\nUsing our RG method we calculate the self-energy up to two-loop order. From it we find a\nnon-zero anomalous dimension and a quasiparticle weight which is nullified at the Fermi points.\nWe compute the RG equations for the renormalized coupling constants g2R and g4R , up to\ntwo-loop order, and demonstrate that they don't flow in the vicinities of the FPs. We derive\nthe Callan-Symanzik equation for the one-particle Green's function at p = kF , p0 = \u03c9. The\n\nFigure 10. The propagators iD++ and iD\u2212+ .\n\n\fFigure 11. The Renormalized vertex function \u0393R\n+.\nCSE is easily integrated producing an expected branch cut structure in G(a)R . Using this we\nderive the spectral function and the momentum distribution function at p = kF . We calculate\n(2)\nthe one-particle irreducible function \u0393(+)R (p, p0 = 0; \u039b) taking into explicit account spin-charge\nseparation effects in the weak coupling regime. Our results are in qualitative agreement with the\nother approaches. Finally we discuss the inclusion of the Ward identities in the RG scheme. We\nshow that their present forms are preserved upon the renormalization and thanks to them the\none-particle irreducible functions in the vicinities of the FPs reduce to interaction propagators\nwhich can be solved exactly by appropriate Schwinger-Dyson equations. To conclude we add\nthat some of the material discussed in this paper have appeared before in the literature in one\nform or another. We tried to relate, whenever possible, our results to some of those works. By\npresenting them here in a field theoretical self-contained form we hope to bring new insights\nconcerning the RG applications with both spin-charge separation effects and Ward identities in\nmore general problems.\n\nFigure 12.
