The classical Lagrange density of QCD can\nbe represented schematically by [1]\nLQCD =\n\nX\nq\n\nq\u0304 (i/\u2202 \u2212 g/A + mq ) q \u2212\n\n1\nG\u03bc\u03bd,a [A] G\u03bc\u03bd\na [A] ,\n4\n\n(1)\n\nwhere q labels quark fields, of mass mq , and where G\u03bc\u03bd,a [A] is the nonabelian\nfield strength, including the self-couplings of the gluon field. We can think\nof this expression as an analogy to electrodynamics, the sum of kinetic terms\nfor the quarks and gluons, supplemented by various local interactions. QCD\nis the Yang-Mills gauge theory [2] of quarks and gluons, in which gluons\nare like photons with charge, so that the gluon field is a source for itself.\nThis nonlinearity, of course, is part of what makes QCD, and the strong\ninteractions it describes, the source of such varied phenomena. It was realized\nearly on that the quarks of QCD provide just the right currents to couple to\nelectromagnetic and weak interactions, so that previous results based on the\nanalysis of those currents (\"current algebra\") could be taken over essentially\nunchanged [3]. In addition, this theory has just the right kind of forces: the\nQCD charge is \"antishielded\", growing larger with increasing distances over\nwhich it is measured. This is its famous property of asymptotic freedom [4].\nLet us sketch how the asymptotic freedom of QCD is established. Working\nconceptually, imagine that we define the strong coupling, g(h\u0304/T ), as just the\namplitude for a quark to emit a gluon within a sphere of radius cT , with c\nthe speed of light. So defined, g(h\u0304/T ) is a running coupling, varying with\nthe scale at which it is measured. The concept is illustrated in Fig. 1. In a\nsense, we send a quark into the sphere, wait a time of order T , and see if it\ncomes out accompanied by precisely one gluon. The amplitude for this to\nhappen is given by an infinite set of perturbative diagrams, each representing\na particular set of quantum mechanical histories. We show some of the lowest\norder diagrams in Fig. 1.\nNow the diagrams within the sphere are described by integrals that do\nnot converge, because there are simply too many states with one or more\nadditional gluons at very large energy. Nevertheless, with a bit of work, we\ncan compute the T -dependence of g(h\u0304/T ), or in more familiar notation, the\n\u03bc \u2261 h\u0304/T -dependence of \u03b1s (\u03bc) \u2261 g 2 (\u03bc)/4\u03c0. With nf different (flavors of)\n1\n\n\fcT\ng(h/T) =\n\n+\n\n+\n+\n\n+\n\nFigure 1: The running coupling defined by a sphere of radius cT .\nquarks, we find\n\u03b1s (\u03bc) \u2261\n\n4\u03c0\ng 2 (\u03bc)\n\u03b1s (\u03bc0 )\n\u0010 2\u0011 \u2261\n\u0010\n\u0011,\n=\n\u03b1\n(\u03bc\n)\n\u03bc\ns\n0\n4\u03c0\n1 + b0 4\u03c0 ln \u03bc2\nb0 ln \u03bc2 / \u039b2QCD\n\n(2)\n\n0\n\nwhere we adopt the common notation b0 = 11 \u2212 2nf /3, and where \u03b1(\u03bc0 )\nand the scale \u039bQCD can be thought of as integration constants. The value\nof \u039bQCD is set by any boundary condition for \u03b1s (\u03bc0 ) at any scale \u03bc0 . In\nother words, it is set by nature, once we learn to measure \u03b1s at a given scale.\nEq. (2) expresses asymptotic freedom, according to which \u03b1s (\u03bc \u2192 \u221e) \u2192 0.\nIn QCD, the colors of virtual gluons \"line up\", like neighboring magnets, a\nfeature that depends on both the spin and the self-interactions of the gluons\nbuilt into the Lagrangian. The smaller the sphere, the fewer the lined-up\nmagnets, and the weaker the interaction.\nAn essential result of asymptotic freedom in QCD is that radiation becomes weaker as momentum scales increase, or equivalently distances (like\ncT above) decrease. In effect, near a color source, the coupling constant is\nweak, a feature that leads to the famous approximate \"scaling\" observed in\ndeep-inelastic scattering, which we will describe below. Correspondingly, far\nfrom a source, the coupling constant appears to grow, a feature that is at least\nconsistent with (although by no means ensuring) the observed confinement\nof colored quarks and gluons.\nIn the years leading up to the discovery of QCD, a template [5, 6, 7] had\nbeen developed to connect the behavior of the running coupling in any field\ntheory with what we now call parton distributions, which we will denote\n2\n\n\fas fi/H (\u03be, \u03bc), for partons i carrying momentum fraction \u03be of hadron H [8].\nHere, \u03bc is a renormalization scale, very much analogous to h\u0304/T above, and\ncan be thought of as determining the scale at which we probe hadron H to\ncount these partons i, leading to probability density fi/H (\u03be, \u03bc). This probescale dependence is encoded in sets of \"anomalous dimensions\", which can\nbe computed as power series in the couplings,\n\u03b1s (1)\n\u03b3N (\u03b1s ) =\n\u03b3 + ... ,\n(3)\n\u03c0 N\nwhere for QCD, we know that \u03b1s (\u03bc)\nvanishes as \u03bc increases. For moments of\nR1\n \u0304\nthe parton distributions, f (N) = 0 d\u03be\u03be N \u22121f (\u03be), the general analysis gives\n[5, 6, 7]\n\"\n\n1\nf \u0304i/H (N, \u03bc) = f \u0304i/H (N, \u03bc0 ) exp \u2212\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u03bc2\n\n\u03bc20\n\nd\u03bc\u20322\n\u03b3N (\u03b1s (\u03bc\u2032 ))\n\u03bc\u20322\n\n#\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nand with \u03b1s (\u03bc) = 4\u03c0/b0 ln(\u03bc2 /\u039b2QCD ), we get:\nln(Q2 /\u039b2QCD )\n \u0304\n \u0304\nfi/H (N, Q) = fi/H (N, Q0 )\nln(Q20 /\u039b2QCD )\n\n!\u22122\u03b3 (1) /b0\nN\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\nOnce the \u03b3N 's were computed at one loop (and eventually all the way to\nthree loops [9]), it all worked.\nTo get back to the parton distributions, fi/H (\u03be, \u03bc), we can invert the moment transform. We can then compute structure function F2 (x, Q2 ), which\ndescribes deeply inelastic scattering in terms of the variable x = Q2 /2p * q\nand the momentum transfer Q2 = \u2212q 2 > 0 (see Eq. (16) below). The data of\nFig. 2 shows exactly a pattern predicted by the explicit forms of the \u03b3N 's: approximate scaling (Q-independence) at moderate x and pronounced evolution\n(Q-dependence) for small x. Perfect scaling for the structure functions would\nfollow for vanishing coupling. This corresponds to \u03bc-independent parton distributions, as in the parton model, which provided a successful description of\nthe first moderate-x data, in which Q-dependence seemed weak if not absent\naltogether [8].\nAs has been widely recognized, the asymptoic freedom of the QCD running coupling is a result of historic significance. This is as much because it\nopens the door to new studies, as because it explained previously mysterious\nfeatures of nature. A tongue-in-cheek analogy that I like is\nScaling\nElliptical Orbits\n=\n.\nQCD\nNewtonian Gravity\n3\n\n(6)\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2: (a) Approximate scaling at moderate x. (b) Pronounced evolution\nfor smaller x. Data from the H1 experiment at HERA.\nIn its explanation of approximate scaling (and the violation, or \"breaking\"\nof scaling), asymptotic freedom is a beginning, not an end. For Newtonian\ngravity, the immediate challenge to the inverse-square law was the three-body\nproblem (moon-sun-earth, for example). For QCD it is how to study a theory\nin which the fundamental degrees of freedom are masked by confinement. The\nultimate goal might be expressed in a similar spirit as\nChemistry\nNuclear Physics\n=\n.\nQCD\nQED\n\n(7)\n\nA short summary of questions we must ask in this context include: can we\n\u2022 Study the particles that give rise to electroweak currents (quarks)?\n\u2022 Study the particles that provide the forces (gluons)?\n\u2022 Expand in the number of gluons (i.e., use perturbation theory)?\nIn QCD the fundamental quanta are confined, and (at least in the absence\nof extreme temperature and pressure) observed hadrons are bound states.\nThe scattering of bound states confronts us with the complex structure of\nthese hadrons, and the strong forces that hold them together on length scales\ncomparable to 1/\u039bQCD . A question that was raised often in the early days\nof QCD was quite simply, \"Does this make sense at all?\"\n4\n\n\f2\n\nLearning to Calculate with the Theory\n\nOur first observation is that not all is hopeless. Certain quantities even in a\nconfining theory are quite \"perturbation theory-friendly\".\n\n2.1\n\nCorrelations and the S-matrix\n\nThe classic examples of quantities closely related to perturbation theory\nare correlation functions between color-singlet currents at short distances,\nschematically,\nhN| J(z) J(0) |Ni = CN (z\u03bc, \u03b1s (\u03bc))\n= CN (1, \u03b1s (1/z)) ,\n\n(8)\n\nin some state N. When N is the vacuum, the primary example is the total\ne+ e\u2212 annihilation cross section, for which J is the electroweak current. In\nthis case, the function CN can be expressed as a power series in the coupling\nevaluated at the momentum scale of inverse distance 1/z (here treated as a\nsimple scalar). Any such quantity, which depends only on one or more short\ndistance scale, is said to be infrared safe. When |Ni is a nucleon state, such\nmatrix elements are related to deep-inelastic scattering. In this case, the\nfunction CN is somewhat more complex, and the matrix element is not itself\ninfrared safe, but its dependence on the short length scale is still computable,\nusing the factorization formalism that we review below.\nCalculating an S-matrix element in perturbative QCD, however, is pretty\nhopeless,\nhB out|A ini = f (Q/\u03bc, m/\u03bc, \u03b1s (\u03bc))\n= f (1, m/Q, \u03b1s (Q))\n= f (Q/m, 1, \u03b1s (m)) ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere A and B are hadronic states, Q is a hard scale, and m denotes various\nsoft scales in the theory, including the masses of light quarks, the (perturbatively vanishing) mass of the gluon, and the strong-coupling scale \u039bQCD from\nEq. (2). No matter what choice we take for the scale in the running coupling,\nwe encounter large ratios of the energy to fixed mass scales. If S-matrix elements are not accessible, are we doomed to compute only correlations of\ncurrents? The answer turns out to be \"not quite\", and here we can turn to\nanother strand of the story.\n5\n\n\f2.2\n\nStructure of final states: Cosmic rays to quark\npairs\n\nAs it turns out, not being able to compute S-matrix elements is not the same\nas begin forbidden to \"look inside the final state\". In fact, as we now know, it\nis possible to see in certain final states a direct portrait of quarks and gluons\nin the form of \"jets\" of nearly collinear high-energy particles. The story of\nthe term \"jets\" actually begins before QCD, in fact even before the paper of\nYang and Mills. This is the tale of particle jets in cosmic rays.\nWhile tracing back some references, I was surprised to read in a paper\nfrom 1957, that \"The average transverse momentum resulting from our measurements is pT =0.5 BeV/c for pions [a table] gives a summary of jet events\nobserved to date . . . \" [10]. Evidently, the jets associated with perturbative\nQCD did not by themselves give rise to the term. What was being reported\nin this paper was a spray of particles of very high energy but limited transverse momentum (a BeV is a GeV), observed in cosmic ray events, as seen\nin emulsions.\nSomewhat over ten years after Ref. [10], accelerators had been developed\nto study the multi-GeV annihilation of electrons and positrons into virtual\nphotons, which can then decay into anything that carries charge. In the\nmeantime, the quark model had been invented, and the quarks carry charge.\nSo, what was going to happen? If (as everyone suspected) we wouldn't see the\nquarks because of confinement, what would we see? Jets? In Physical Review,\nDrell, Levy and Yan [11] took the step of extending the parton model from\ndeep-inelastic scattering to e+ e\u2212 annihilation, and built into their model the\nsame limited transverse momentum that had been observed a decade earlier\nin cosmic rays, describing the limitation as a cutoff: \"Because of our cutoff\nkmax \u226a |q| . . . The distribution of secondaries in the colliding ring frame will\nlook like two jets . . . \"\nNow this was a real prediction for the nature of final states in e+ e\u2212 \u2192\nhadrons, and following the spirit of the parton model, Drell, Levy and Yan\nsuggested that the angular distribution of the jets would follow the same\nangular distribution as a quark pair, or any other spin-1/2 pair, in Born\napproximation, 1 + cos2 \u03b8, with \u03b8 the angle to the beam axis (see Fig. 3). In\nthis picture, partons \"fragment\" into hadrons. Whether this would happen\nwas a question to ask of both nature and of QCD. Would the final states\nlook like this?\nIn nature, they did, as shown by the analysis of Hanson et al. at SLAC in\n6\n\n\f\u03b8\n\n?\n\n\u03b8\n\nFigure 3: Representation of the conjecture that there is a relation between\nquark pairs and jets for e+ e\u2212 annihilation.\n1975 [12]. And, in the fullness of time, that's what happens in deep-inelastic\nscattering, in e+ e\u2212 annihilation and in hadron-hadron scattering.

If so, how can we hope\nto compute cross sections?\nWe can get insight into the challenges involved, and their possible solutions, by recalling the related \"infrared problem\" of QED, and its \"solution\".\nAs is often the case, the problem is related to asking the wrong question, and\nthe solution to identifying the right one.\nIn QED, typical exclusive cross sections have infrared divergent corrections in perturbation theory, which show up as logarithmic dependence on\nthe (vanishing) mass of the photon. This happens as soon as we go to the\norder \u03b1EM \u2261 e2 /4\u03c0 correction of a Born cross section, say in electron-electron\nscattering at momentum transfer Q:\n(1)\n\u03c3ee\u2192ee\n(Q, me , m\u03b3 \u2192 0, \u03b1EM ) \u223c \u03b1EM \u03b2ee\u2192ee (Q/me ) ln\n\nQ\n,\nm\u03b3\n\n(10)\n\nwith \u03b2ee\u2192ee (Q/me ) a function that is finite for vanishing photon mass, m\u03b3 .\nFollowing the famous Bloch-Nordsieck analysis [13], however, we trace this\ndivergence to asking an unphysical question, the probability for one or more\ncharged particles to scatter, and in the process be accelerated, while emitting\n8\n\n\fRun 178796 Event 67972991 Fri Feb 27 08:34:03 2004\n\n385\n\nET\n(GeV)\n\n360\n\n3\n\n180\n\n4.7\n\n2\n\nphi\n\n1\n0\n\nBins: 481\nMean: 2.32\nRms: 23.9\nMin: 0.00933\nMax: 384\n\n-1\n-2\n0\n\n-4.7\n\neta\n\n-3\n\nmE_t: 72.1\nphi_t: 223 deg\n\nFigure 6: Jet pair at a hadron collider.

In effect, we are computing the probability of something\nthat never happens.\nThe classical theory demands radiation, and classical radiation requires\nan essentially unlimited number of very low-energy photons. This is Bohr's\ncorrespondence principle between quantum and classical mechanics. Rather\nthan count the number of photons (zero, one . . . ), Bloch and Nordsieck [13]\ncounseled that we introduce an energy resolution, \u01ebQ with \u01eb \u226a 1, and then\nsum over final states with arbitrary photon emission, as long as the total\nenergy comes in below the energy resolution. Experimentally, this is not a\nchoice, but a necessity, because our apparatus will always miss some photons\nif they are soft enough. At first, however, it sounds complicated. How can\nwe sum over all soft photons? But this will not be necessary.\nFollowing the Bloch-Nordsieck procedure, suddenly the full order \u03b1EM\ncorrection with an energy resolution becomes finite by itself, the log of m\u03b3 /Q\nbeing replaced by a log of \u01eb, as the result of a cancellation between the final\nstates with and without an extra photon. As long as \u03b1EM ln(1/\u01eb) \u226a 1 (which\nis almost inevitable), the correction is small,\n(1)\n\n\u03c3 ee\u2192ee+X(\u01eb) (Q, me , \u01ebQ, \u03b1EM ) \u223c \u03b1EM \u03b2ee\u2192ee (Q/me ) ln\n9\n\n1\n.\n\u01eb\n\n(11)\n\n\fThe magic (and beauty) of this is that we don't have to sum over an infinite\nnumber of soft photons, even though this is the root cause of the problem!\nNow let's think about QED in the very high-energy limit. On a closer\nlook, we find that the function \u03b2ee\u2192ee (Q/me ) itself has a log of Q/me . Given\nthat the dominant term depends only on the ratio, we can as well trade\nthe high-energy limit for the double, photon-and-electron, zero mass limit.\nBut in this case, our energy resolution is not enough to produce finite cross\nsections. If, however, we can solve this problem in QED, we may be able to\nsolve it as well in high-energy QCD, where the high-energy limit also involves\nlogarithmic enhancements in ratios of momenta to all particle masses.\nWe wish to look for quantities that are capable of measurement, have a\nsingle hard momentum scale, Q, and which nevertheless have no powers of\nln(Q/m), only at worst (m/Q) ln(Q/m). Such quantities become functions\nof only that single hard scale, and are calculable as a power series in the\ncoupling \u03b1s (\u03bc), with \u03bc = Q, without introducing any large ratios when\nQ \u2192 \u221e with fixed masses, or equivalently m \u2192 0 at fixed Q. These are\nquantities for which asymptotic freedom can be naturally applied, and are,\nin the terminology mentioned above, infrared safe.\nWe've already seen that an energy resolution alone is not enough for infrared safety. Progress can be made, however, by an analogy to the argument\nfor an energy resolution based on the unobservability of arbitrarily soft photons. We can just as well say that two exactly collinear massless particles\ncannot be distinguished from a single massless particle of the same total momentum (and total quantum numbers), whether that momentum is soft or\nnot. That is, if p2 = 0 and p\u20322 = 0 and if p\u03bc and p\u2032\u03bc are collinear, then\n(p + p\u2032 )2 = 0 as well. So whether the combination is a single particle or two\nparticles is not easy to distinguish.\nThis approach works, and enables us to take the zero-mass limit for all\nparticles in QED and QCD. Roughly speaking, any cross section with an\nenergy and an angular resolution is infrared safe in e+ e\u2212 annihilation [14].\nIf two particles are closer together in direction than some angle, \u03b4, then we\ntreat them the same way as we do a single particle. We'll also see that\nhadron-hadron cross sections of this sort, while not themselves infrared safe,\ncontain an infrared safe factor that we can isolate.\nThe conditions for infrared safety may also be rephrased in a more general\nform as follows. Any cross section that sums over all states that (1) differ by\nthe emission or aborption of soft particles, or (2) by the splitting or recombination of exactly collinear particles, is infrared safe [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]\n10\n\n\f(or contains an infrared safe factor.) It is worth noting that to prove infrared\nsafety for jet cross sections requires an extension of the beautiful theorems\nthat apply to fully inclusive transition probabilities [20]. This involves a\ncareful reanalysis of perturbation theory, and is especially dependent on how\nthe gauge invariance of the theory manifests itself [16].\nThe most direct application of infrared safety is to jet cross sections in\n+ \u2212\ne e annihilation, exactly of the type illustrated schematically by Fig. 3 and\nin experiment by Fig. 5. So long as the resolutions are large, we can represent\nthe use of asymptotic freedom for jet cross sections by an appropriate choice\nof renormalization scale, taken here as the total energy Q,\n\u03c3 (Q/\u03bc, \u01eb, \u03b4, \u03b1s (\u03bc)) = \u03c3 (1, \u01eb, \u03b4, \u03b1s (Q)) ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u01eb and \u03b4 represent the energy and angular resolutions mentioned above,\nor more generally other parameters that define the cross section. Computed\nin this fashion, there is no need for a transverse momentum cutoff of the sort\ninvoked in Ref. [11]. The infrared safety of the observable ensures that highpT radiation is suppressed by factors of \u03b1s (pT ). Such radiation is present,\nof course, but it influences the infrared safe quantity through calculable corrections, just as the effects of soft gluons influence QED cross sections in a\nfinite way at higher orders.\n\n2.4\n\nThe field-theoretic content of infrared safety\n\nSummarizing, we recount the \"sorrows\" of QCD perturbation theory, and\nhow they can be overcome, at least in part. First, there is color confinement,\nwhich may be interpreted as the statement that matrix elements like\nZ\n\nd4 x e\u2212ip*x h0| T [qa(x) . . .] |0i ,\n\n(13)\n\nin which we take the Fourier transform of a quark or other field with a\nnontrivial color representation has no p2 = m2 pole in a Green function, with\nT time-ordering. (This is confinement.) Second, poles at physical particle\nmasses, such as p2 = m2\u03c0 for pions,\nZ\n\nd4 x e\u2212ip*x h0| T [\u03c0(x) . . .] |0i ,\n\nare not accessible to perturbation theory.\n11\n\n(14)\n\n\fDespite all this, we are able to use infrared safety and asymptotic freedom for such quantities as the total cross section for e+ e\u2212 annihilation into\nhadrons. What are we really calculating? Totally inclusive examples like\nthese are related by the optical theorem to forward-scattering amplitudes of\nthe general form\nZ\n\nd4 x e\u2212iq*x h0| T [J(x)J(0)] |0i ,\n\n(15)\n\ninvolving color singlet currents, just as in Eq. (8). Deep-inelastic scattering\ninvolves hadronic matrix elements rather than the ground state [17, 18],\ni Z 4 \u2212iq*x\nd xe\n< N(p)| T [ J\u03bc (x)J\u03bd (0) ] |N(p) >\n8\u03c0\n!\nq\u03bc q\u03bd\n= \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 2\nF1 (x, Q2 )\nq\n!\n!\np*q\np*q\n1\n+ p\u03bc \u2212 q\u03bc 2\np\u03bd \u2212 q\u03bd 2\nF2 (x, Q2 ) ,\nq\nq\np*q\n\nW\u03bc\u03bd = 2 Im\n\n(16)\n\nfor electroweak currents, J\u03bc , and nucleon states, |N(p)i, with x \u2261 p * q/Q2\nand q 2 = \u2212Q2 < 0. The Fi (x, Q2 ) are the same structure functions as shown\nin Fig. 2. For such matrix elements, we will apply factorization properties,\nwhich will enable us to isolate the infrared safe factors referred to above.\nAnother class of color singlet matrix elements enables us to describe jetrelated cross sections [21]. These look like\nlim R2\n\nR\u2192\u221e\n\nZ\n\ndx0\n\nZ\n\ndn\u0302 f (n\u0302) e\u2212iq*y h0| J(0)T [n\u0302i T0i (x0 , Rn\u0302)J(y)] |0i ,\n\n(17)\n\nwith T0i the energy momentum tensor, and n\u0302 a vector on the unit sphere.\nSuch a matrix element represents the action of a calorimetric detector, which\nmeasures energy flow, and matrix elements such as these are what we really\ncalculate when we compute jet cross sections. For a general cross section,\nwe introduce a \"weight\", given by function f (n\u0302). As long as all the derivatives, dr f (n\u0302)/dn\u0302r , of the weight are bounded, individual final states may\nhave infrared divergences, but they cancel in the sum over collinear splitting/merging and soft parton emission, because these transitions respect energy flow [16]. We regularize the divergences dimensionally (typically) and\ncalculate the long-distance enhancements in amplitudes, only to cancel them\nin infrared safe cross sections. It is this intermediate step that makes many\n12\n\n\fcalculations tough, and is part (not all) of why higher-order calculations are\nso difficult. It may be worth noting that one of the goals of a collider experiment is remarkably similar \u2013 to control late stage interactions of particles\nonce they enter the detectors.\n\n3\n\nExtracting Infrared Safety: Factorization\n\nAny cross section with one or two hadrons in the initial state has inescapable\nlong-distance behavior, because a semi-inclusive sum over initial states is\nsimply not a practical option. In effect, we can choose the energy of the\nnucleon(s) that initiate our scattering process, and sometimes their spin, but\nlittle else. By construction, then, cross sections at hadronic colliders are not\ninfrared safe. The technqiue of factorization, however, enables us to isolate\nand extract infrared safe dependence in a large set of otherwise long-distance\nphenomena. Here we review the physical basis of factorization, and show how\nthe factorization of a process also leads to useful information on its energydependence, including the evolution of the moments of parton distributions,\nas in Eq. (4) above.\n\n3.1\n\nFactorization\n\nThe general form of a factorized cross section (here multiplied by Q2 to make\nit dimensionless), is [22, 23]\nQ2 \u03c3phys (Q, m) = \u03c9SD (Q/\u03bc, \u03b1s (\u03bc)) \u2297 fLD (\u03bc, m) + O (1/Qp ) ,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere as shown on the left, the \"physical\" cross section \u03c3 depends generically\non a hard scale Q and on a wealth of soft scales, denoted collectively by m.\nThe soft scales include in general the gluon mass, which is zero, as well\nas various quark masses, and the scale of the perturbative coupling, \u039bQCD ,\nencoded in the running coupling, Eq. (2).\nOn the right of Eq. (18), we give the schematic factorized form of \u03c3, in\nwhich the Q-dependence and m-dependence are separated. There is a shortdistance function \u03c9SD , which is infrared safe, and a long-distance function\nfLD , which for hadronic initial states is not calculable in perturbation theory.\nThe short- and long-distance functions are linked by a convolution, denoted\n\u2297. For deep-inelastic or hadron-hadron scattering the convolution is in par13\n\n\ftonic momentum fractions, \"x\", which is transformed into a simple product\nby the moments leading to Eq. (4) above.\nDimensional analysis requires that we introduce a new scale, \u03bc, the factorization scale, so that \u03c9SD and fLD can be nontrivial functions of Q and m,\nrespectively. In effect, the factorization scale marks the boundary between\nshort-distance and long-distance dependence.\nAs indicated in Eq. (18), factorization is not normally an exact result,\nbut it often holds up to corrections that behave as inverse powers of Q. For\nmany important examples, such as unpolarized deep-inelastic scattering cross\nsections, corrections enter only as 1/Q2 , and are negligible for many purposes\nonce Q reaches several GeV.\nIn the most familiar examples, including the structure functions F1 and F2\nin (16), the fLD are parton distributions, and we shall refer to them as such.\nThe parton distributions themselves can be expressed in terms of expectation\nvalues [24] in hadronic states that fix light-cone components of the momenta\nof the partons in\u221aquestion. We take the light-cone components for any vector\nv \u03bc as v \u00b1 = (1/ 2)(v 0 \u00b1 v 3 ), with v 2 = 2v + v \u2212 \u2212 vT2 . A vector whose only\nnonvanishing component is v + or v \u2212 is light-like, v 2 = 0.\nFor example, the (spin-averaged) distribution of quark q in nucleon N\nwith momentum p\u03bc = p+ \u03b4\u03bc+ , and spin s, is\ndy \u2212 \u2212ixp+ y\u2212\ne\n< N(p, s) | q\u0304(0+ , y \u2212 , 0\u22a5 )\n\u2212\u221e 2\u03c0\n1\n(19)\n\u00d7 \u03b3 + \u03a6n (y \u2212 , 0) q(0) | N(p, s) > .\n2\nWe can compare this form to the matrix element for currents, Eq. (16). In\nthis case, the factorization scale, \u03bc, enters because we must renormalize the\nproduct of quark fields that are separated by a light-like distance y \u2212 in the\nminus direction. The operator \u03a6(y \u2212 , 0) is a \"gauge link\", between the two\nfields, whose purpose is to render the matrix element gauge invariant, and\nwhich is defined by\n1X\nfq/N (x, \u03bc ) =\n2 s\n2\n\n\u2212\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\"\n\n\u03a6n (y , 0) = P exp \u2212ig\n\nZ\n\n0\n\ny\u2212\n\n\u03bc\n\n#\n\ndl n * A(ln ) ,\n\n(20)\n\nwith n\u03bc = \u03b4\u03bc\u2212 . Here the field A\u03bc = a A\u03bca Ta is given as a matrix in terms of\nthe relevant generators of SU(3), which for quarks are in fundamental (3 \u00d7 3)\nrepresentation. The symbol P denotes an ordering of these color matrices\nalong the path between l = 0 and l = y \u2212 .\nP\n\n14\n\n\f3.2\n\nFrom factorization to evolution\n\nIf we can factorize a cross section as in Eq. (18), its Q-dependence is calculable. As such, we can compute it systematically in extensions of the standard\nmodel that include new heavy states, which modify the short-distance behavior of the theory. \"New physics\", then, is embedded in a calculable fashion\nin \u03c9SD . While not calculable in perturbation theory, the functions fLD are\n\"universal\", portable from one factorizable process to another.\nThe key to the portability of parton distributions, is their \"evolution\",\nwhich enables us to compute their dependence on the factorization scale\n[25]. Calculable evolution is not a separate assumption, but rather a direct\nconsequence of the factorization in Eq. (18). We need only observe that the\nphysical cross section cannot depend on the factorization scale,\n0=\u03bc\n\nd\nln \u03c3phys (Q, m) .\nd\u03bc\n\n(21)\n\nWe can thus separate dependence on Q and m by requiring that the \u03bcdependence of the short-distance function cancel that of the long-distance\nfunction,\n\u03bc\n\nd ln fLD\nd ln \u03c9SD\n= \u2212P (\u03b1s (\u03bc)) = \u2212\u03bc\n.\nd\u03bc\nd\u03bc\n\n(22)\n\nThe \"separation constant\" P (\u03b1s ) can depend only on those variables that\nthe short- and long-distance functions hold in common: the coupling and\nthe convolution variables. Eq. (22) is an evolution equation. We can solve\nit to relate parton distributions at one \u03bc to another, and therefore, because\nwe can always choose \u03bc = Q in Eq. (18), we can relate the cross section\nat one Q to that at another scale, up to corrections associated with the\nexpansion of \u03c9SD (Q/\u03bc, \u03b1s (\u03bc)) in the strong coupling. Of course, this analysis\nrequires that \u03b1s remain small in the range over which we wish to evolve.\nSchematically, then, we can exhibit the cross section's dependence on the\nmomentum transfer as\n(\n\n\u03c3phys (Q, m) = \u03c9SD (1, \u03b1s (Q)) \u2297 exp \u2212\n\nZ\n\nQ\n\nQ0\n\nd\u03bc\u2032\nP (\u03b1s (\u03bc\u2032 )) fLD (Q0 , m) ,\n\u03bc\u2032\n)\n\n(23)\njust as in Eq. (4) for the moments of structure functions.\n15\n\n\f3.3\n\nThe pattern of a factorized cross section\n\nA large class of hadronic cross sections can be factorized, as long as they\nare defined in a manner consistent with the energy flow interpretation described in the previous section. This involves, in general, observing a jet-like\nstructure in the final state and summing over soft radiation between the jets.\nThe general structure of any such observable falls into a form that can be\nrepresented schematically as\nY\nd\u03c3a+b\u2192jets {i} (Q)\na\u2032 +b\u2032 \u2192{di }\na\u2032 +b\u2032 \u2192{di }\n= fa\u2032 /a \u2297 fb\u2032 /b \u2297 HIK\n\u00d7 SKI\n\u00d7\nJdi .\ndQ\njets {i}\n\n(24)\nWe can think of this expression as recounting a (quantum-mechanical) story:\nevolved incoming partons represented by fa\u2032 /a , fb\u2032 /b collide and exchange momenta at short distances. A function HIK describes quantum corrections at\nthat scale (Q), where K and I identify color exchange in the amplitudes and\ntheir complex conjugates, respectively. These indices are in a color tensor\nbasis that reflects the numbers and color representations of all the \"active\"\npartons, a\u2032 , b\u2032 , and {di } [26]. In general, the color exchange at short distances influences the development of the system at long distances, through\na color-exchange-dependent soft function, SKI describing the production of\nsoft particles. Finally, the production of energetic particles and jets is described by a set of functions Jdi , each specifying the fragmentation of the\nparent parton di of jet i. These fragmentation processess are mutually incoherent, with a universal evolution into the final states that is itself the result\nof this factorization.\nEq. (24) holds in general to all powers of the coupling, with power corrections in hard scales. The latter, however, can be quite complex, involving\nratios of the maximum soft energy to jet energies: Esoft /Ejet , but also inverse\npowers of the energy of soft radiation. That is, we also anticipate \"power corrrections\" of the form m/Esoft , with m any of the long-distance mass scales\nin the theory [27]. On the perturbative level, the very presence of a factorization involving soft, jet and short-distance functions ensures more elaborate\nevolutions, involving double-logarithmic corrections [28].\nIt is worth noting that the original cosmic ray jets were not of this sort.\nTheir properties are not computable in quite the same way, because for the\nmost part they lack truly high-momentum transfer subprocesses, represented\n16\n\n\fby HKI in Eq. (24). For recent applications of perturbative QCD to such\n\"inclusive\" proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus cross sections, see Ref. [29].\nA generalization of Eq. (24) applies in hadronic scattering to high-transverse\nmomentum (pT ) single-particle inclusive cross sections. In this case, the jet\nfunctions of Eq. (24) are replaced by fragmentation functions,\nd\u03c3A+B\u2192H+X (pT ) =\n\nX\nc\n\nd\u03c3\u0304A+B\u2192c+X (pT /z\u03bc) \u2297 DH/c (z, mc , \u03bc)\n+O(m2c /p2T ) ,\n\n(25)\n\nwith a sum over fragmenting partons c. The cross section d\u03c3\u0304 includes parton\ndistributions for the initial state. Here, following the formalism developed by\nCollins and Soper [24], the fragmentation function, DH/c can be defined as\na vacuum expectation value similar to those above for the distributions, but\nnow involving creation and annihilation operators for the observed hadron.\nFor a gluon to fragment to hadron H, for example, the function is [24]\nZ\n1\n+\n\u2212\nDH/g (z, mc , \u03bc) = \u2212\nTr color dy \u2212 e\u2212i(P /z)y\n+\n16(2\u03c0)P\n(adj)\n\n\u00d7h0|G+\u03bb (0) [\u03a6\u2212\n\n(adj)\n\n(0)]\u2020 a\u2020H (P + ) aH (P + ) \u03a6\u2212\n\n(y \u2212 ) G+ \u03bb (y \u2212 )|0i ,(26)\n\nwith G\u03bc \u03bd the gluon field strength and a\u2020H the creation operator for hadron\nH. The relevant ordered exponential, or gauge link, for this process is\n(adj)\n\n\u03a6\u2212\n\n\u0014\n\n(x\u2212 ) = P exp \u2212ig\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\u0015\n\nn * A(adj) (x\u2212 + \u03bb)n\n\n,\n\n(27)\n\nwhere n\u03bc is a lightlike vector in the opposite direction to the jet. For gluon\nfragmentation, the gauge field A(adj)\nis an 8 \u00d7 8 matrix in the adjoint repre\u03bc\nsentations of SU(3) generators. Such a gauge link gives rise to a nice set of\ndiagrammatic rules, in terms of \"eikonal lines\" in the x\u2212 direction (n\u03bc = \u03b4\u03bc\u2212 ),\nwith vertices \u2212ign\u03bc \u00d7 (group f actors) and (linear) propagators i/(n * k), illustrated in Fig. 7. To the jet, as it fragments, all that's left of the rest of\nthe world is a gluon source moving in the opposite direction, whose entire\ninfluence is summarized by the eikonal line. Similar considerations apply to\nthe parton distributions, Eq. (19).\n\n3.4\n\nThe classical basis of factorization\n\nWhere do factorized cross sections like Eq. (24) come from? In the following\nwe review an argument based on the classical Lorentz transformation properties of fields, and point out the subtleties of gauge fields in particular [30]. An\n17\n\n\fFigure 7: Graphical representation of the ordered exponential, Eq. (27).\nargument based on a classical picture isn't far-fetched, precisely because, as\nnoted above, the correspondence principle is the key to the origin of infrared\ndivergences. Any accelerated charge must produce classical radiation, and\ninfinite numbers of soft gluons are required to make a classical field. Thus\nthe classical field has a lot to tell us about the radiation of soft partons.\nHaving said this much, we consider the situation illustrated in Fig. 8, in\nwhich one \"bound state\", approaches another (from the left in the figure)\nat a relativistic velocity \u03b2 \u2192 1 in the x3 -direction, carrying with it various\npoint charges, its \"partons\". The coordinates of the bound state on the left\nare indicated by unprimed variables, those on the right by primed. We will\nrefer to the former as the projectile, the latter as the target.\nSuppose the partons of our projectile are sources for a massless scalar\nfield, whose magnitude we denote by \u03c6. In their own rest frames, the sources\nproduce a simple 1/|~x| potential. By definition, the magnitude of a scalar\nfield at any point in space-time is independent of the coordinate system in\nwhich it is observed. We can thus start with an expression for our massless\nscalar field in the rest frame of the projectile, and simply reexpress it in terms\nof the coordinates of the target. To do so we use x3 = \u03b3(\u03b2ct\u2032 \u2212 x\u20323 ) \u2261 \u03b3\u2206\u2032 ,\nwhere as usual \u03b3 = (1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 )\u22121/2 . This gives\nq\nq\n\u03c6(x) = q\n,\n= \u03c6\u2032 (x\u2032 ) =\n2\n(xT + \u03b3 2 \u2206\u20322 )1/2\nx2T + x23\n\n(28)\n\nwhere q is a charge and xT the distance of closest approach, which is transverse to the motion. Naturally, the field is maximized in the target coordi1 \u2032\nx3 .\nnates at the time of closest approach, where \u2206\u2032 = 0, that is, at t\u2032 = \u03b2c\n\u2032\nAt this target time, the magnitude of the field is simply q/xT . At all other\nvalues of the time t\u2032 , however, the field of the oncoming projectile partons\nis proportional to an explicit factor of 1/\u03b3. In summary, the scalar field\n18\n\n\fq\n\n\u03b2\n\n1\n\nx,y,z,t\n\nx,y,z,t\n\nx3\nFigure 8: Schematic representation of the field of an oncoming particle.\n\u2032\ntransforms \"like\n\u221a a 2ruler\", that is, at any fixed \u2206 6= 0, the field decreases\nlike 1/\u03b3 = 1 \u2212 \u03b2 as \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e. This is to say that for any fixed time in\nthe target frame before closest approach, the field of the projectile decreases\nrapidly as the velocity of the projectile approaches the speed of light. This\nis just a consequence of length contraction in elementary special relativity.\nWhen an observer riding on the projectile (!) measures a distance x3 , then\nan observer sitting on the target measures a much larger distance.\nNext, we suppose that the sources of the projectile couple to the electromagnetic field instead of a scalar field, producing in their own rest frames the\nsame 1/|~x| potential, but now as the zeroth component of the vector A\u03bc (x).\nThe following array compares gauge fields to scalar fields from this point of\nview. We compare, on the one hand, the A0 component of the field in the\nprojectile frame to the A0 component in the target frame, found by Lorentz\ntransformation, and on the other hand the longitudinal (third) component\n\n19\n\n\fof the electric field in both frames,\nfield\n\nx frame\n\nx\u2032 frame\n\nscalar\n\nq\n|~\nx|\n\nq\n(x2T +\u03b3 2 \u22062 )1/2\n\nA0 (x) =\n\ngauge\nfield strength\n\nE3 (x) =\n\nq\n|~\nx|\n\nA\u20320 (x\u2032 ) =\n\n\u2212q\n|~\nx|2\n\nE3\u2032 (x\u2032 ) =\n\nq\u03b3\u03b2\n(x2T +\u03b3 2 \u22062 )1/2\n\n\u2212q\u03b3\u2206\n(x2T +\u03b3 2 \u22062 )3/2\n\n.\n\nWe can ask the same question of the electromagnetic potential and field\nstrength that we posed for the scalar field: at a fixed target time before the\npoint of closest approach, how does the field observed at the target depend\non the velocity of the projectile? The answers for the gauge field and the field\nstrength are strikingly different. The gauge potential is actually independent\nof \u03b3 as \u03b2 \u2192 1 for any fixed \u2206\u2032 6= 0! The vector potential (at least its time\ncomponent) is not contracted at all. On the other hand, the field strength,\nas represented by E3 , decreases as 1/\u03b3 2 , which is a much more rapid decrease\nthan even the scalar field.\nThese two behaviors are, of course, consistent, and are reconciled by the\nrealization that the vector field of a relativistic charge approaches a total\nderivative in the target (primed) frame as \u03b2 \u2192 1,\nA\u2032 \u03bc (x\u2032 ) = q\n\n\u2202\nln (\u03b2ct\u2032 \u2212 x\u20323 ) + O(1 \u2212 \u03b2) .\n\u2202x\u2032\u03bc\n\n(29)\n\nThe bulk of this A\u03bc is actually an unphysical polarization, and can be re~\nmoved by a gauge transformation. In contrast, the physical \"force\" field E\nof the projectile does not overlap the target until the moment of closest approach. \"Advanced\" effects in the electric field are corrections to the total\nderivative in Eq. (29), and hence are of the size\n2\n1 q\nm2\n1\u2212\u03b2 \u223c\n,\n(30)\n1 \u2212 \u03b22 \u223c\n2\n2\u03c9 \u20322\nwhere m is the mass of the projectile, and \u03c9 \u2032 its energy in the target frame.\nThis is a power-suppressed behavior, and a typical initial-state correction to\nfactorization.\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n20\n\n\fFactorization expresses this contraction effect. As the oncoming projectile approaches the speed of light, the appearance of its field is essentially\ninstantaneous at the time of closest approach. The projectile then cannot\naffect the internal structure of the target, or vice-versa, and the target's internal structure is thus effectively universal among all projectiles, so long as\nthe latter are sufficiently relativistic. The initial state structure of the target\nand projectile can then both be summarized by multiplicative factors, and\nthese are the parton distributions of Eq. (24).\nThis argument, of course, applies only to initial-state interactions, signals\nexchanged before the hard interaction. For final-state processes to respect\nfactorizations like Eq. (24), it is also necessary that we define the observable\nin a manner consistent with infrared safety. In addition, for factorization to\nhold, we must require that there be a hard scattering. Otherwise there is no\nwell-defined time at which the scattering occurs, and indeed no sharp distinction between the initial state and the final state. If there is a well-defined\nhard scattering, however, low-momentum transfers after that scattering are\ntoo late to affect the large momentum transfer process(es), such as the creation of jets or of heavy particles. Similarly, the fragmentation of partons\ninto jets of hadrons is too late to know details of the hard scattering, leading\nto the factorization of fragmentation functions.\n\n3.5\n\nFactorization in perturbation theory\n\nPerturbative arguments for factorization in QCD [22, 23] are, unfortunately,\nmuch more complex than the simple classical pictures above. Nevertheless,\nthe physical observations we have just made have a direct correlation in\nperturbation theory, which is worth pointing out. We consider a soft gluon,\nof momentum k emitted by a fast quark, whose momentum p\u03bc is on-shell\n(p2 = m2 ) just after this interaction. In perturbation theory, this will be\nassociated with a factor like\n\u016b(p) (\u2212ig \u03b3 \u03bc )\n\n/p + k/ + m\np\u03bc\n=\n\u016b(p)\n(\u2212ig\n)\n+ (IR f inite) ,\n(p + k)2 \u2212 m2\np*k\n\n(31)\n\nwhere in the second form we have used the Dirac equation, and have suppressed terms proportional to k, which are infrared finite, as well as color factors. In an arbitrary perturbative diagram, the vector p\u03bc on the right-hand\n21\n\n\fside will be contracted with the propagator of the soft gluon that carries\nmomentum k. Now suppose we were to choose a gauge for which p * A = 0,\nin which case the gluon propagator is given (with p2 = 0) by\ni\nG (k) = \u2212 2\nk\n\u03bd\u03bc\n\ng\n\n\u03bd\u03bc\n\np\u03bd k \u03bc + k \u03bd p\u03bc\n\u2212\np*k\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(32)\n\nIn this gauge, the soft gluons decouple from the quark. This argument can\neasily be generalized beyond lowest order, and applies to the entire set of\ncollinear partons, whether quark, antiquark or gluon, in that jet. No gauge\nchoice like this, of course, can decouple soft gluons from more than one jet\nat a time. But the existence of such a gauge for each jet implies that soft\ngluon couplings cannot resolve more than the direction and overall color of a\njet [23, 31]. This is the origin of the \"universality\" of soft gluon interactions,\nand their summary in terms of eikonal lines like those of Eq. (27) and Fig.\n7, which play a central role in factorization for perturbative QCD.\n\n4\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have summarized a few of the major results of perturbative QCD, which\nunderly the basic applications of the theory to hadron-hadron and hadronlepton collisions at large momentum transfer. We have presented justifications wherever they can be found, in both classical and quantum intuition.\nThe coming decade will see unprecedented applications of the ideas and\nmethods of perturbative QCD at the Large Hadron Collider, in protonproton, proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus experiments. Whether as a pesky\nbackground to new physics searches, or as a subject of interest in its own\nright, QCD, with its self-generated scales and evolving degrees of freedom,\nwill remain a benchmark for our understanding of physics at its most challenging.\n\nReferences\n[1] H.
