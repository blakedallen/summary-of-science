The result suggests that\nsurface effects could be dominant over the 'bulk' properties of small diameter wires.\n\n\f2\n\nIntroduction\nCurrently, as electronic devices are scaled down to the sub-100 nm regime, Ge has\ngained renewed interest as a material of choice for future electronics due to its\nsignificantly higher electron and hole mobilities than Si.1,2 It is well known that the water\nsolubility of GeO2 and the lack of a stable oxide have prevented Ge from being utilized as\nan electronic material in the past. This problem could now be solved, in principle, by\nusing the recently advanced high dielectric-constant (high-\u03ba) films as gate insulators.\nIndeed, promising results have already been reported for metal-oxide-semiconductor\ncapacitors and field effect transistors (FET) based on Ge with high-\u03ba films as dielectric\nmaterials.3,4 Despite these progresses, the surface chemistry of Ge remains much less\nexplored and understood than that of Si. Detailed understanding of how various species\non Ge surfaces affecting the electrical properties of Ge is lacking. Further, approaches to\nreliably passivate Ge surfaces still have to be fully established and require significant\neffort.\nChemically synthesized nanomaterials such as nanotubes and nanowires have\nattracted much attention lately as building blocks for future electronics.5-13 These bottomup chemically derived materials may present advantages over top-down lithographically\npatterned materials in better intrinsic properties in the case of carbon nanotubes,6,7 higher\ndegrees of structural or surface perfection, lower costs than single crystalline wafer\nmaterials in the case of Ge or high flexibility in the type of substrates that can be used for\nassembly of these materials. Ge nanowires are particularly appealing due to the high\n\n\f3\n\ncarrier mobility and the ease of synthesis. We have shown recently that single crystalline\nGeNWs can be readily synthesized by a simple chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method\nat a low temperature of 275\u00b0C from Au nanoparticle seeds.10 The growth condition for\nGeNWs is the mildest among all semiconducting wires and represents the lowest\ntemperature under which single crystalline semiconductors are synthesized. The potential\nof the GeNWs as building blocks for electronic devices has also been demonstrated by\nsuccessful fabrication of FETs based on p-type GeNWs with a hole mobility on the order\nof 600cm2/Vs, approaching 1800cm2/Vs that of bulk Ge.4\nThe high surface areas of nanotubes and nanowires suggest that surface effects could\nplay dominant roles in determining their physical properties. The electrical properties of\nnanotube and nanowire devices could be affected by various surface species including\nmolecules adsorbed from the environment.14 For an example, hysteresis in the electrical\ncharacteristics of carbon nanotube FETs has been observed due to physisorbed water\nmolecules on the nanotube surface and on the SiO2 substrates around the nanotube.15\nTransistor prototypes based on several semiconducting nanowires including Si have been\nobserved to exhibit hysteresis behavior.16 The origin of hysteresis in nanowire FETs\nhowever, remains largely elusive thus far. To our knowledge, no systematic effort has\nbeen taken to elucidate or eliminate the origin of the hysteresis. Uncontrolled hysteresis is\nhighly problematic since it will make the operations of electronic devices highly\nunpredictable. Removal of the hysteresis will require detailed understanding of the\n\n\f4\n\nsurface chemistry involved in various nanowires. This is particularly important and\nchallenging for GeNWs due to the well-known poor surface oxide properties for Ge.\nIn this article, we present a systematic investigation of the electrical characteristics\nand surface chemical properties of p-type and n-type GeNWs. We first show that p- and\nn-type doping of GeNWs can be achieved by introducing desired doping gases during\nCVD growth of GeNWs. Detailed hysteresis behaviors of as-fabricated GeNW FETs are\nthen described. A thermal annealing process is developed to eliminate or suppress such\nhysteresis. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is then used to elucidate the surface species\nfor as-made and cleaned GeNWs. The spectroscopy results combined with electrical data\nlead to the conclusion that the hysteresis in GeNW FETs are caused by water molecules\nabsorbed on GeNW surface oxides. Moreover, XPS measurements clearly reveal band\nbending in GeNWs due to Fermi level pinning of surface states. The importance of\nsurface effects to nanowires is discussed especially for wires with sizes approaching the\nnanometer scale. We also present a preliminary surface passivation method based on\natomic layer deposition of HfO2 high-\u03ba dielectrics.\n\nMethods.\nMaterials. Germane in helium (GeH4, 10% in He), diborane in hydrogen (B2H6,\n10ppm in H2) and phosphine in hydrogen (PH3, 150ppm in H2) were purchased from\nVoltaix, Inc. (Branchburg, NJ). Gold nanoparticle colloid solutions were purchased from\nSigma-Aldrich Co, and the diameters of the Au particles varied from 2nm to 20nm.\n\n\f5\n\nTransmission electron microscopy grids with Ni frames and thin SiOx supporting film\nwere obtained from Structure Probe, Inc. (West Chester, PA).\nCVD growths of GeNWs. (1) Synthesis of intrinsic GeNWs. Growth was carried\nout at 275\u00b0C with GeH4 flow of 10 sccm (standard cubic centimeter per minute) and H2\nco-flow of 100 sccm in a 1\" quartz tube furnace.10 Typical growth time was 30-40\nminutes. Catalyst was either Au nanoparticles (diameters = 2 to 20nm) deposited on SiO2\nor Si substrates from an aqueous solution of Au colloids (by soaking the substrates in a\naminopropyltriethoxysilane APTES solution then in a Au colloid solution for 30 min) or a\nthin Au film (thickness ~3nm) evaporated from an electron-beam evaporator. (2)\nSynthesis of boron-doped p-type GeNWs. To grow p-type GeNWs, H2 co-flow was\nreplaced with a mixture of H2/B2H6 (B2H6 concentration 10ppm). All other growth\nparameters were kept the same as for the intrinsic wires. (3) Synthesis of phosphorousdoped n-type GeNWs. Pure H2 and PH3 in H2 (PH3 concentration 150ppm) were used as\nco-flows (H2 flow rate 80sccm and H2/PH3 flow rate 20sccm) of GeH4 for n-type Ge\nnanowire growth. As shown later by transistor data, these growth conditions were\neffective in producing p- and n-doped GeNWs respectively. Our low 275\u00b0C CVD growth\nusing germane was mild and highly reproducible. No significant reduction in the yield of\nGeNWs was observed due to the addition of B2H6 or PH3. (4) Synthesis of GeNWs on\nTEM grids. Au nanoparticles were deposited on a TEM grid with SiO2 supporting film in\nthe same manner as on a Si or SiO2 substrate. The grid was subjected to CVD growth and\nthe resulting GeNWs were imaged by TEM directly after growth.10\n\n\f6\n\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XPS measurements were carried out\non a PHI Quantum 2000 scanning microprobe equipped with an angle-resolved\nhemispherical electron energy analyzer and a base system pressure of 1 \u00d7 10-9 torr. All\nmeasurements were performed using the Al K\u03b1 line with a photon-energy of 1486.6 eV.\nCharge compensation during acquisition was applied using the improved dual\nneutralization capability including an electron flood gun and an ion gun. C 1s (284.8 eV)\non SiO2 substrate were used to calibrate the process parameters and to ensure sufficient\ncharge compensation. Ag and Cu standards were also employed to calibrate the system.\nThe samples used for XPS studies were mats of p- or n-type GeNWs (random dense\nnetworks of GeNWs) grown on SiO2 substrates with a thin Au film (3 nm) deposited on\nthe substrates as catalyst.\nTransmission electron microscope (TEM) and scanning electron microscope\n(SEM). The transmission electron microscope used was a Philips CM20 with a working\nacceleration voltage of 200 keV. The scanning electron microscope used was a FEI Siron\nfield emission instrument operated at relatively low acceleration voltages of 1 keV to 5\nkeV.\nGeNW FETs with back-gate and SiO2 gate-dielectrics. SiO2/Si (p++) substrates\nwere used for growth and integration of GeNWs into FET structures (Fig. 2a). The\nthickness of SiO2 formed by dry oxidation was 10 nm (verified by ellipsometry) in the\nsource (S), drain (D) and NW channel regions. The SiO2 thickness was 500 nm in regions\nunder large electrical bonding pads to avoid potential damages to the SiO2 during\n\n\f7\n\nelectrical probing or wire-bonding. Details of the substrates design and preparation can be\nfound in a previous work.17 Au seeds (average particle size ~10nm) were deposited on the\nSiO2/Si surface in a patterned fashion10,18 and used for CVD growth to produce GeNWs\n(p-type or n-type) from the patterned catalyst sites. After growth, samples with p-type\nNWs were annealed at 400 oC for 2 h intended for dopant activation and then soaked in\n0.1 M HCl for 30 seconds to remove native surface oxides on the GeNWs. No annealing\nor activation was carried out for n-type GeNWs prior to device fabrication.\nPhotolithography or electron-beam lithography patterning of photo-resist, metal\nevaporation (30 nm of Ti) and lift-off were then used to form S and D metal electrodes on\ntop of the GeNWs. The length of the GeNW between the edges of the S and D electrode\nwas typically L=3\u03bcm. FET operation was carried out by using the heavily doped Si as the\nback-gate electrode and the 10 nm SiO2 as the gate dielectric (Fig.2a). Note that even\nthough the GeNWs were treated in HCl (known to remove germanium oxides) prior to\nthe fabrication steps, the GeNWs were exposed to the ambient environment for ~ 1-3\nweeks through the device fabrication steps, which caused the formation of oxides on the\nGeNWs in the as-fabricated devices. Ti was used here for S and D electrodes to contact\nGeNWs since Ti-Ge contacts were found to remain intact after high temperature\nannealing up to 450\u00b0C. This stability was useful for our annealing experiments carried\nout for GeNW FETs, as described below. Though optimization of contacts was not the\nmain scope of the current work, we note that earlier, Pd was found to form more\ntransparent contacts for GeNWs.4 Pd was not used here since the quality of the contacts\n\n\f8\n\ntended to degrade upon annealing to 450\u00b0C. Also as a side note, we did not observe\nsignificant improvement of the Ti contacts with GeNWs upon annealing to 450\u00b0C.\nALD of HfO2 for top-gated GeNW FETs with high \u03ba dielectrics. ALD of HfO2\nfilms on the back-gated p-type GeNW FETs described above was carried out to produce\ntop-gated devices with high k gate dielectrics (Fig. 9a). The back-gated p-type GeNW\nFETs were first 'cleaned' by annealing at 450\u00b0C for ~0.5 h in vacuum to remove surface\noxides. The sample was then transferred to an ALD chamber for HfO2 deposition after a\nbrief and minimized exposure to air (<0.5 h). HfO2 was deposited uniformly onto the\nsample (including GeNWs, S and D electrodes and the substrate) by reacting deionized\nwater with tetrakis(diethylamido)hafnium (Hf[NEt2]4) precursor in a layer by layer\nfashion.19 Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas, and the deposition temperature was 90\u00b0C.\nEach ALD reaction cycle involved alternating H2O and Hf[NEt2]4 doses and the purge\ntimes were 350 s after the DI H2O dose and 150 s after the Hf[NEt2]4 dose. The sample\nwas exposed to ~ 80 cycles of ALD to deposit a HfO2 film with nominal thickness of ~ 8\nnm. After the dielectric deposition, a lithography step was carried out to pattern top-gate\nmetal electrodes on top of the GeNW channels with HfO2 sandwiched in between,\nforming top-gated GeNW FETs. Note that there was an under-lap between the gate and\nS/D electrodes (Fig.9a&9b) with the top-gate switching only the GeNW section directly\nunderneath the top-gate. The Si back-gate was used to control the NW sections aside of\nthe top-gate and was fixed at a constant voltage. Detailed operation of this type of\ntransistor can be found in a previous pubication.20\n\n\f9\n\nAnnealing of GeNWs in vacuum for oxide removal. Annealing was performed\nfor both mats of GeNWs grown on SiO2 substrates and GeNW FETs in a vacuum\nchamber with a base pressure of 5\u00d710-8 torr. The sample was placed on a metal stage\nequipped with a thermal heater and a thermal couple for temperature monitoring.\nAnnealing was typically performed at 450oC for 30 minutes, which was found to be\nefficient in volatilizing germanium oxides on GeNWs. After annealing, the GeNW FETs\n(p-type or n-type) were quickly transferred into a vacuum chamber (5\u00d710-7 torr) for exsitu electrical measurements, and the transfer process exposed GeNWs in the devices to\nambient air for ~10-20 minutes. For XPS measurements, the GeNW mats were\ntransferred into the XPS vacuum chamber after exposure to ambient air for a specified\namount of time ranging from minutes to 1/2 h or to days.\n\nResults and Discussions.\nGrowth. High yield of single crystalline GeNWs can be grown by our simple\nCVD method at 275\u00b0C with various Au seeds ranging from discrete Au colloidal\nnanoparticles to vapor-phase deposited thin Au films. The growth mechanism for the\nGeNWs involves the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) process, as described previously.10 Shown\nin Fig 1 is a low magnification TEM image of as-grown GeNWs from nominally 5 nm Au\nnanoparticles deposited on a TEM grid. The inset in Fig. 1 shows a lattice resolved high\nresolution TEM image of a ~ 4 nm diameter GeNW. We found that GeNW size was\nhighly controllable by tuning catalyst sizes. The smallest wires we successfully and\n\n\f10\n\nreproducibly grew were ~3 nm from ~2-3 nm Au nanoparticles. On 3 nm thick Au films,\nCVD growth led to the formation of a dense mat of GeNWs with diameters of 10-30 nm,\nsuggesting that large Au particles were formed when the Au film was heated during CVD\nand these particles served as seeds for GeNWs growth.\nCharacteristics of p-type GeNW FETs. The back-gated FETs fabricated on Bdoped GeNWs clearly exhibited p-type transistor behavior with about 3 orders of\nmagnitude conductance (G) decrease under positive gate voltages (Fig.2c), indicating\nsuccessful incorporation of p-type B-dopants into GeNWs during the CVD synthesis\nprocess. An immediate phenomenon we observed during electrical characterization of the\nun-passivated GeNW FETs (with NWs exposed to ambient air) was the large hysteresis in\nthe current vs. gate voltage (Ids-Vgs) curves. That is, the source-drain current is sensitive\nnot only to gate voltage, but also to the gate voltage sweeping directions. The broken\nlines in Fig. 2c are Ids-Vgs curves recorded with a p-type GeNW FET under gate sweeping\nfrom Vgs = \u20132V to 2V and then back to \u20132V at a sweep rate of \u2206Vgs/\u2206t=0.3 V/s. A ~ 1V\ndifference in the threshold voltages was clearly present between the Ids-Vgs curves\nrecorded under the two sweeping directions. The amount of hysteresis typically increased\n(i.e., larger differences in threshold voltages or larger hysteresis loops) under decreased\ngate sweeping rate \u2206Vgs/\u2206t and was observed with all of the as-fabricated GeNW FETs\n(nearly 100 devices characterized) without exception. The hysteresis was nearly\nunchanged when the GeNW FETs were placed and measured in vacuum (5\u00d710-7 Torr,\nFig.2c), even under vacuum pumping for extended periods of time up to several days. At\n\n\f11\n\na first glance, the hysteresis behavior appeared to be a result of slow charging and\ndischarging of states or chemical species on the GeNWs during gate sweeps.\nElimination of hysteresis for p-type GeNW FET. We carried out various\ntreatments of the GeNWs aimed at eliminating and understanding the origin of the\nhysteresis. Our general strategy was to clean the GeNWs and thus eliminate the states or\nchemical species responsible for the hysteresis. After experimenting with various\nmethods including solution phase chemical etching of Ge oxides,21-23 we found that the\nmost efficient method of eliminating hysteresis in the GeNW FETs was simple annealing\nin vacuum at ~ 450\u00b0C. The GeNW FETs were typically annealed in vacuum at ~450oC\nfor 1/2 h and then transferred to another vacuum chamber for ex-situ electrical\nmeasurements. During the transfer, the devices were briefly exposed to ambient air for\n~20 min. After the brief exposure and when placed back in vacuum, the annealed p-type\nGeNW FETs exhibited almost no hysteresis (<30 mV difference in threshold voltage) as\nshown in Fig. 3a, and the result was independent of the gate voltage sweep rate in the\nrange of \u2206Vgs/\u2206t = 0.03 to 0.6 V/s. These results illustrate that the thermal annealing step\nis effective in eliminating hysteresis for p-type GeNW FETs.\nCause of Hysteresis. The annealed GeNW FETs remained hysteresis free as long\nas kept in vacuum. Upon exposure of the devices to air, large hysteresis was observed\nimmediately (within 1 min) as shown in Fig. 4a for a typical device. The hysteresis\ndisappeared as soon as the sample was placed back into vacuum (Fig. 4b, circles) after a\nshort (~ 10 minutes) exposure to air. The reversible hysteresis removal and re-appearance\n\n\f12\n\nwere observed for up to many vacuum/air-exposure cycles as long as the air exposure was\nbrief (minutes). This result hinted that the hysteresis was caused by molecules adsorbed\non the GeNW surfaces from the ambient air, and that for p-type GeNWs with surface\noxides removed by 450\u00b0C annealing (see for example ref.21 and later sections for\nevidence of oxide removal), the molecules causing the hysteresis can be readily desorbed\nby pumping in vacuum.\nIn a control experiment, we exposed an annealed GeNW FET to dry air and\nobserved no hysteresis at all in the device characteristics (Fig.4b, solid line). This hints\nthat H2O molecules adsorbed on the GeNW surfaces are responsible for the hysteresis\nbehavior of the GeNW FETs.\nLong exposures of p-type GeNWs (after high temperature annealing/cleaning) to\nambient air were found to cause hysteresis that were irreversible by vacuum pumping.\nFor example, after 1-day exposure of an annealed p-GeNW FETs to ambient air, a\nhysteresis of ~200mV was observed (Fig. 4c) when measured with the device placed back\nin vacuum. After exposure to air for 1-week, the measured hysteresis in vacuum increased\nto ~500 mV (Fig.4d). This result was consistent with that the as-made p-type GeNW\nFETs (with the GeNWs exposed to air for typically > 1-week during device fabrication)\nexhibited large hysteresis that persisted in vacuum. As shown later, long air-exposure of\np-type Ge leads to the formation of a surface GeO2 layer that strongly adsorbs H2O\nmolecules. The water molecules do not desorb from the GeO2 layer on the GeNW in\nvacuum and are responsible for the irreversible hysteresis behavior of the transistors.\n\n\f13\n\nCharacteristic of n-type GeNW FETs and different hysteresis behaviors from\np-type FETs. N-type GeNW FETs were successfully fabricated with phosphorous-doped\nn-type GeNWs, as shown by the orders of magnitude conductance increase (vs. decrease\nfor p-FET) under positive gate voltages (Fig.5a). This suggested successful incorporation\nof P-atoms into the GeNWs during CVD growth in the presence of PH3. The asfabricated n-type GeNW FETs (exposed to ambient air for ~ 1 week after growth) also\nexhibited large hysteresis (~1V) under back-and-forth gate voltage sweeps (Fig.5a).\nVacuum annealing experiments at 450\u00b0C were conducted on n-type GeNW FETs,\nfollowed by transferring of the devices to another vacuum chamber for electrical\ncharacterization, during which the devices were exposed to ambient air briefly (20 min).\nThis treatment led to clear reduction of hysteresis, but unlike the p-type GeNW FETs,\nsmall hysteresis persisted for the n-type FETs (Fig.5b). This result, as shown later by XPS\ndata, is due to rapid GeO2 formation on n-type Ge (which differs from p-type Ge) during\nthe brief air-exposure sample-transfer step, causing strong water adsorption on the GeO2\non the nanowires and therefore the irreversible hysteresis. After annealing of the n-type\nGeNW FETs, exposure of the devices to air for ~ 1 week led to large hysteresis similar to\nthat of as-fabricated n-FETs (Fig.5c).\nXPS of p-type and n-type GeNWs with Native Oxides. XPS experiments were\nperformed on mats of GeNWs to investigate the species on the nanowire surfaces and\nthen correlate the results with electrical properties of the GeNW transistors. Ge is known\nto oxidize in various environments and form GeO and/or GeO2 depending on the\n\n\f14\n\nenvironmental conditions.24,25 The freshly grown GeNWs contained large numbers of\nsurface atoms and are therefore highly reactive. Once synthesized, the GeNWs were\nretrieved from the CVD growth chamber and exposed to the ambient air. For both p- and\nn-type GeNWs exposed to air for >~1 day after CVD synthesis, XPS revealed the\npresence of 'native' GeO and GeO2 on the GeNW surfaces, as shown in the Ge 3d and Ge\n2p spectra in Fig.6. The zero valent Ge0 states are peaked in the 3d spectra around 29.8eV\nto 29.95eV (Fig. 6a and b) and the germanium oxides are around 32.7eV to 33eV. Curve\nfittings (Fig.6a and b) reveal that the oxide peaks correspond to combinations of Ge2+\n(GeO) and Ge4+ (GeO2). The peak positions of Ge0 and Ge2+ and Ge4+ are consistent with\nliterature values reported for Ge wafers, with ~0.75 eV shift per oxidization state.22,25,26\nThe presence of surface native oxides can also be clearly seen from Ge 2p spectra in Fig.\n6c and 6d for p and n-type GeNWs respectively.\nXPS of p-type and n-type GeNWs after annealing at 450\u00b0C. It is known that\nboth GeO and GeO2 can be removed from Ge surfaces by thermal annealing in vacuum.\nGeO starts to vaporize above ~ 400\u00b0C. GeO2 by itself is stable up to higher\ntemperatures,27 but when in contact with Ge, GeO2 reacts with Ge at >~400 C, converts\nto GeO and then sublimes.21 Therefore, relatively clean and oxide-free surfaces are\nexpected for GeNWs after heating above 400\u00b0C. Our XPS data recorded with both p- and\nn-type GeNWs after annealed to 450\u00b0C indeed revealed the removal of the oxides\nsignaled by the significantly reduced peaks corresponding to the oxides (Fig.7a and b).\nDifferent oxidation behaviors of p- and n-type GeNWs. The XPS data of p-\n\n\f15\n\nand n-GeNWs after annealing shown in Fig. 7a and b still displays weak signals in the\nregion corresponding to Ge oxides due to sample transfer and exposure to air for ~2 min\nafter the annealing. We have systematically varied the air-exposure time and recorded\nXPS spectra to investigate the oxide formation processes on p- and n-type GeNWs. For ptype GeNWs, after annealing and 2 min air-exposure, a shoulder-like feature can be seen\nnear the Ge0 peak in the Ge 3d spectra, and peak fitting reveals that the shoulder mainly\ncorresponds to GeO. Longer air exposures (1/2 h to 1day) cause the shoulder to grow and\nshift towards higher binding energies (Fig.7c), and the spectrum recorded after 1-day\nexposure shows a clear peak corresponding to GeO2 (Fig.7c). Curve fitting also shows\nGeO in coexistence with GeO2. These results suggest that upon exposure of 'clean' p-type\nGeNWs to air, oxide quickly forms on the Ge surfaces and the oxide species is\npredominantly GeO. Longer air exposure causes the growth of oxides on the surfaces and\nthe formation of appreciable amount of GeO2 on p-type GeNWs is relatively slow and\ntakes a relatively long time (hours).\nThe n-type GeNWs exhibit different oxidation behavior than the p-type wires.\nAfter annealing and a brief 2 min air-exposure, appreciable amount of GeO2 is already\ndetected on the nanowire surfaces (Fig.7b). Longer exposures (1/2 h to 1day) of the nGeNWs to air cause the intensity of the oxide peak to grow, but unlike the p-type\nGeNWs, no significant shift in the peak position is observed (Fig. 7d). These results\nsuggest that GeO2 formation is rapid on n-type GeNW surfaces, within minutes of\nexposure to air. Longer exposure times in air lead to thicker GeO2 films.\n\n\f16\n\nIt is to our knowledge the first time that dopant-dependent reactivity is reported\nfor Ge. The p-type GeNW oxidation behavior, i.e., rapid GeO formation followed by slow\nGeO2 growth is similar to previous reports for p-type Ge wafers.24 No systematic\ninvestigation on n-type Ge wafer oxidation has been reported previously. Note that\ndopant dependent chemical reactivity is known for semiconductors including Si. An\nexample is the drastically different etching rates for p- and n-type Si wafers in XeF2\netching gases.28 Nevertheless, a detailed understanding of the different oxidation\nbehaviors of n- and p-type semiconductors is currently lacking and we leave it for future\ninvestigations.\nBand bending in oxidized GeNWs due to interface states. In addition to the\noxide species on GeNWs, our XPS results also revealed band bending caused by GeGeOx interface states on GeNWs with surface oxides. For p-type GeNWs, the removal of\nthe native oxides by annealing at 450\u00b0C leads to a \u20130.3 eV shift of the Ge0 3d peak from\n29.8eV to 29.5eV (Fig.7a). For n-type GeNWs, an opposite +0.1 eV shift from 29.95eV\nto 30.05eV is observed after oxide removal (Fig.7b). These results suggest the existence\nof Ge/GeOx interface states residing within the band gap of Ge, giving rise to Fermi level\npinning at the interface and band bending away from the interface with a characteristic\nscreening length d (Fig.8). The band bending causes an increase (for p-type, Fig. 8a) or\ndecrease (for n-type, Fig. 8b) in the distance between the Ge 3d core-level to the Fermi\nlevel, and thus increases or decreases the binding energy of the Ge 3d level relative to\nbulk Ge for p- and n-type GeNWs respectively. Oxide removal at the surface eliminates\n\n\f17\n\nthe interface states and band bending, thus shifting the Ge peaks towards that of bulk Ge.\nThe band-bending behaviors reported here for p- and n-type GeNWs are similar to those\npreviously observed with p- and n-type Ge wafers.22,29 Band bending due to surface\ninterface states has also been reported for other semiconductors including Si and\nGaAs.30,31 32 Note that for oxide-free p- and n- type GeNWs, the Ge0 3d peaks are at\n29.5eV and 30.05 eV respectively (Fig. 7a and b.), and the 0.55 eV difference\napproximately matches the Ge band gap of 0.6 eV. The Ge0 3d peak shift for n-GeNW is\nrelatively small after oxide removal compared to the p-type, suggesting the interface\nstates are close to the conduction band in n-type GeNWs with native oxides.\nCorrelating hysteresis of GeNW FETs with surface XPS data. Correlating our\nelectrical and XPS data suggest that surface bound water is responsible for hysteresis in\nGeNW FETs. We can also infer that water association with GeO2 on GeNW surfaces is\nstrong and does not desorb by simple vacuum pumping, while the opposite appears to be\ntrue for water-GeO interaction. These are consistent with that as-fabricated p- and n-type\nGeNW FETs exhibit hysteresis that cannot be removed by placing the devices in vacuum.\nFor p-type GeNW FETs, hysteresis is diminished after annealing in vacuum even with a\nbrief re-exposure to air. This is consistent with XPS data of GeO2 removal by vacuum\nannealing and predominantly GeO formation (rather than GeO2) during the brief air reexposure. For n-type GeNW FETs, hysteresis persisted after oxide removal followed by\nbrief air exposure due to rapid formation of GeO2 and strong association with water\nmolecules. It is therefore rather difficult to eliminate surface bound water and related\n\n\f18\n\nhysteresis in n-type Ge devices if any short air-exposure of clean n-type Ge surfaces can\nnot be avoided.\nThe interface states due to Ge surface oxides could also act as charge traps and\ncaused hysteresis behavior to the electrical characteristics of FETs. However, for our pGeNW FETs exposed to pure oxygen or dry-air after vacuum annealing, no significant\nhysteresis was observed (Fig.4b) even after extended (2 h) exposure to pure oxygen,\nwhile XPS data revealed the formation of GeO and GeO2 on p-type Ge during such\nexposure.24 Hysteresis was observed immediately once the devices were taken out of the\npure oxygen and exposed to ambient air (Fig.4a). These results confirm H2O molecules\non the oxide surface rather than the Ge/GeOx interface states as the main cause to the type\nof hysteresis concerned in the current work. The hysteresis is large (on the order of ~ 1V),\nslow and dependent on gate sweep rate (in the range of \u2206Vgs/\u2206t=0.03 to 0.6 V/s). It is\npossible that GeOx/Ge interface states also give rise to hysteresis behavior, but at a\ndifferent time scale than the one probed here by DC electrical measurements.\nWater on Ge oxide surfaces. XPS data clearly revealed that GeNWs exposed to\nair contain native oxides on surfaces. The suggested strong interaction/association\nbetween H2O from the ambient air and surface GeO2 is reasonable since GeO2 is known\nto be soluble in H2O. The surface chemistry of SiO2 and Si is much better studied than for\nthe Ge system. The existence of physisorbed water layers on native SiO2 on Si is well\nknown and in fact, approximately one monolayer of H2O is hydrogen bonded to the\nhydroxyl groups on SiO2. As a result of the strong binding, desorption of the final surface\n\n\f19\n\nwater layer on SiO2 only occurs above ~ 250\u00b0C.33 While systematic spectroscopy work is\nneeded to elucidate detailed H2O interactions with GeOx/Ge, we note that several\nprevious infrared spectroscopy work on GeOx/Ge surfaces have indeed identified\nadsorbed water species.34-35 A temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiment\nrevealed the existence of water and related species on Ge surfaces at high temperatures\nup to 250-300 \u00b0C before desorption during heating.36\nWater in various bottom-up electronic devices including nanotubes,\nnanowires and organic FETs. For modern Si electronics, much is known about the\ncauses and elimination of hysteresis in metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) FETs. Slow\nstates and hysteresis related to water has been reported for MOSFETs without proper\nencapsulation/passivation, as well as for MOS capacitances and tunnel diodes with\nhydrated SiO2 gate insulators.37-39 Recently, we have reported hysteresis in single-walled\ncarbon nanotube FETs formed on SiO2 substrates due to water molecules physisorbed on\nnanotube surfaces and on SiO2 surrounding the nanotube.15 The current GeNW results\nrepresent another example of hysteresis phenomena in nanomaterials-based devices due\nto surface water. The water effect appears to be general in various un-passivated FETs\nbased on materials derived by bottom-up chemical methods. There are several reports of\nlarge hysteresis observed in other types of nanowire FETs and in various organic\ntransistors built on SiO2 substrates.40,41 We believe that water is a likely cause of\nhysteresis in these systems as well. The removal of surface bound water will be\ndependent on the specific systems and surface chemistry involved. For instance, in the\n\n\f20\n\ncase of carbon nanotube FETs, coating the nanotubes with a polymer,\npolymethylmathacrylate (PMMA) followed by baking can remove water adsorbed on the\nnanotube and on SiO2 surfaces.15 Hydrogen bonding of PMMA with the latter is\nresponsible for removing the water layer on SiO2.42 In the case of GeNWs, similar\nPMMA passivation method was unsuccessful in removing the hysteresis, suggesting that\nH2O association with surface GeO2 is strong and cannot be removed by the PMMA\ntreatment. Note that it is possible that H2O-derived surface species such as \u2013OH groups\nmay contribute to hysteresis. Systematic infrared spectroscopy work is indeed needed to\nclearly identify the species on Ge surfaces treated under various conditions, and to\ncorrelate with the electrical properties of Ge devices.\nMechanism of hysteresis due to water. The detailed mechanism of surface water\ncausing hysteresis behavior in un-passivated electronic devices is not fully understood\nand requires further investigation. We suggest that a possible mechanism is due to the\nlarge electric dipole of water molecules. In an electric field on the order of ~1V/nm\ngenerated by the gate voltage, water molecules will respond to the field and be oriented.\nThe water molecule orienting and relaxation processes under sweeping gate voltages and\nelectric fields could exert varying dipole fields to the channel of the FETs, giving rise to\nadditional gating mechanism to the transistors and therefore hysteresis. Other\nmechanisms are certainly possible including the relaxation of mobile impurities and ions\non the surface of the transistor materials in the presence of water.\nDoping levels and radial screening lengths in NWs. The doping level (n) in\n\n\f21\n\nGeNWs can be estimated based on43 resistivity (\u03c1) of the nearly hysteresis-free GeNW\nFETs (Fig. 3 and 5b for p- and n-type respectively) at zero gate-voltage\nn=\n\n1\ne\u03bc\u03c1\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bc is carrier mobility estimated from the FET characteristics (e.g., Fig.3b)\n\n\u03bc=\n\ndI ds L2\n1\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\ndVgs Cox Vds\n\n(2)\n\nThe gate-capacitance Cox=3.8\u00d710-16F is estimated from\nCox =\n\n2\u03c0\u03b5 0 \u03b5L\nR + tox\ncosh \u22121 (\n)\nR\n\n(3)\n\nwhere tox=10nm is the SiO2 gate oxide (\u03b5~4) thickness, L ~ 3 \u03bcm is the length of the\nGeNW between source and drain electrodes and R ~ 5 nm is the NW diameter. The\nresistivity \u03c1 of GeNW under zero gate voltage is determined from\n\n\u03c1=\n\ndVds L\n\u00d7\ndI ds A\n\n(4)\n\nwhere A is the NW cross-sectional area. Through this analysis, we obtained a B-doping\nlevel of n=3\u00d71018/cm3 for p-type GeNWs and a P-doping level of n=6\u00d71018/cm3 for ntype GeNWs. Note that the ratio of B:Ge in the feeding gases for GeNW CVD growth\nwas 1:500 and 1:300 for P:Ge, corresponding to maximum possible doping\nconcentrations of 8\u00d71019cm-3 and 1.2\u00d71020cm-3 respectively for p and n-type GeNWs.\nThe extent of band bending due to Fermi level pinning by surface states can be\nestimated for nanowires. For a planar surface with surface Fermi level pinning potential\nof \u03c60, the screening length (or band bending length extending into the semiconductor with\n\n\f22\n\ndoping concentration of n) d is given by44\nd=\n\n4\u03c0\u03b5 0\u03b5\u03c60\n2\u03c0 n\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03b50 is the permittivity of vacuum and \u03b5 is the dielectric constant of the\nsemiconductor (\u03b5 ~16 for Ge). For a nanowire with radius R, the depletion length d\n(along the radial direction of the NW, Fig. 8c) can be obtained after solving the Poisson's\nequation using cylindrical coordinates (for d<R),\n4\u03c0\u03b5 0\u03b5\u03c60\n\uf8eb d\uf8f6 \uf8ee\n\uf8eb d \uf8f6\uf8f9\n\u2212\n= R 2 \uf8ec1 \u2212 \uf8f7 \u00d7 \uf8ef1 \u2212 2 ln \uf8ec 1 \u2212 \uf8f7 \uf8fa \u2212 R 2\n2\u03c0 n\n\uf8ed R\uf8f8 \uf8f0\n\uf8ed R \uf8f8\uf8fb\n2\n\n(6)\n\nFor d<<R, to the first-order of the NW curvature (d/R), the radial screening length d in\nthe NW is given by,\n\n4\u03c0\u03b5 0\u03b5\u03c60 \uf8eb\nd \uf8f6 2\n= \uf8ec1 \u2212\n\uf8f7d\n2\u03c0 n\n\uf8ed 3R \uf8f8\n\n(7)\n\nwhich suggests that the screening length in a nanowire is longer than that in the planar\nsurface case. This is a reasonable result since screening becomes less effective when\napproaching the core of a NW due to the reduced radial dimension. Note that Eq. 6 and 7\nare valid only for d<R. For d\u2265R, the whole nanowire along the radius will be depleted\nand it is no longer meaningful to calculate d.\nIf we assume that the GeNWs are large in radius with R>>d, then for our p-type\nGeNWs with n=3\u00d71018cm-3 and Fermi level pinning of \u03c60=0.3eV (Fig. 7a), a screen\nlength of d~13nm is estimated based on Eq. 5. For n-type GeNWs with n=6\u00d71018cm-3 and\n\n\u03c60=0.1eV, d~6nm is obtained. These lengths represent the lower limit of the true\n\n\f23\n\nscreening lengths for the finite radius nanowires. The fact that they are similar to our\nGeNWs radii in the range of R=5 to 15 nm suggests that for the GeNWs with native\noxides, Fermi level pinning and band bending at the surface will affect a large part of the\nNW 'bulk'. Such a surface effect could significantly alter the electrical properties of the\nwires. For p-type NWs, for instance, removal of surface oxides leads to a shift of\nthreshold voltage by +2 V in the transistor characteristics (Fig. 2c vs. Fig.3a), indicating\nthat the NWs with surface oxides are un-intentionally 'n-doped' as a result of band\nbending extending deep inside the wires from the surface due to surface states Fermi\nlevel pinning (Fig. 8a).\nThe analysis above points to the importance of surface to the bulk properties of\nsemiconducting nanowires. Clearly, as the size of NW decreases, the dominance of\nsurface effect will increase. Surface passivation is particularly important to GeNWs due\nto the high density of surface states (>1014/cm2).45 Surface effects could also become\nsignificant in nanowires of Si or other types of semiconductors with low surface-state\ndensities (~ 1012/cm2)45 especially if the diameters of the wires become very small. These\nissues will need to be systematically addressed by future research.\nPreliminary result of passivation of GeNW FETs by ALD of HfO2. We carried\n\nout preliminary experiments for passivating GeNW FETs. For p-type GeNW FETs, we\nfirst removed surface oxides on the GeNWs by vacuum annealing at 450\u00b0C and then\ncarried out ALD HfO2 at 90\u00b0C with minimum exposure of the devices to air after the\nannealing (~ 10 min total). Top-gate GeNW FETs obtained this way exhibited negligible\n\n\f24\n\nhysteresis under top-gating when measured in vacuum or dry environments. These\ndevices can be stored in ambient air for days without exhibiting large hysteresis when\nmeasured in a dry environment. This result suggests that the high-\u03ba films on p-type\nGeNW FETs can be used as the first layer of passivation while serving as the gate\ninsulator. Further work will be needed to investigate the nature of the HfO2/Ge interface\nand understand the passivation effect. It will also be necessary to devise further\npassivation layers on top of the high \u03ba films to completely block water, oxygen and other\nmolecular species from the ambient air.\n\nConclusions\n\nSingle crystalline germanium nanowires with p- and n-dopants were synthesized by\nchemical vapor deposition at 275\u00b0C and used to construct p- and n-type field effect\ntransistors respectively. The growth condition is mild and the size of the nanowires can be\nwell controlled by the size of the Au nanoparticle seeds down to the 3-5 nm scale.\nElectrical transport and XPS measurements were carried out to understand the Ge surface\nchemistry and its role in the electrical characteristics of GeNWs. Large hysteresis\nobserved in the electrical properties of non-passivated GeNWs was found to be mainly\ndue to water molecules strongly bound to GeO2 on GeNWs. Water adsorption on GeO\nwas found to be weaker than on GeO2 and can be easily removed. N-type GeNW FETs\nwere more susceptible to hysteresis behavior due to more reactive surfaces towards rapid\nGeO2 formation than p-type Ge. P-type GeNWs on the other hand, form GeO on the\n\n\f25\n\nsurfaces initially when exposed to air and then appreciable amount of GeO2 after long\nexposures (hours). This is the first time that different chemical reactivity and hysteresis\ncharacteristics are observed for p- and n-doped Ge.\nOpposite band bending due to interface states between Ge and surface oxides were\nobserved for p- and n-type GeNWs. An annealing method was devised to remove surface\noxides on GeNWs and eliminate or suppress hysteresis for GeNW FETs. Further, it was\nfound that thin high-\u03ba dielectric HfO2 films grown on GeO2-free GeNW surfaces by\natomic layer deposition (ALD) was effective in serving as the first layer of surface\npassivation for GeNWs.\nThe current work reveals fundamental chemical and physical properties of Ge and\nmay have important implications to Ge as a candidate material for future electronics.\nFurther, the results should be of interest beyond Ge since surface water appears to be a\ngeneric cause to hysteresis in electronic devices based bottom-up chemically derived\nnanomaterials ranging from carbon nanotubes to various semiconductor nanowires or\neven organic transistors. Lastly, the depletion length or screening length along the radial\ndirection of nanowires is evaluated. The result suggests that surface effects could be\ndominant over the 'bulk' properties of small diameter wires.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe are grateful to Prof. S. Bent and R.

(a) Current vs. gate voltage (Ids-Vgs) curves showing nearly\neliminated hysteresis after annealing (measured in vacuum) of the same device as in Fig.\n2. The bias voltage used to record this curve was Vds=100 mV. (b) Current vs. voltage\n(Ids-Vds) curves under various gate voltages as labeled.\n\n\f32\n\nFigure 4. p-type GeNW FET hysteresis vs. various environment. Vds=100mV for all\n\nmeasurements. (a) Large hysteresis in the Ids-Vgs characteristics of the device in Fig.3\nobserved during a brief exposure to ambient air after annealing and surface oxide\nremoval. (b) Hysteresis diminished when the device was placed in vacuum (symbols) and\ndry air (solid line). (c) After 24 h exposure of the device to ambient air, the device\nexhibited hysteresis that persisted when measured in vacuum. (d) After one-week\nexposure of the device to air, the device exhibited larger hysteresis when placed back into\nvacuum than in (c).\n\nFigure 5. Hysteresis of n-type GeNW FETs.

Note that the Ge\n3d peak exhibited only slight shifts after exposure to air for up to 1 day. The degree of\nband bending was smaller than the sample in (a) that had been exposed in air for > 1\nweek due to less oxidation. (d) Similar data to (c) for n-type GeNWs.\n\nFigure 8.
