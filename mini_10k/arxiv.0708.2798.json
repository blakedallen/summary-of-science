The main drawback of such\nmodels is that they suffer from the overshoot problem. Namely the initial condition\nshould be fine tuned to be near the inflection point for the universe to inflate. We\nshow that stringy realizations of inflection point inflation are common and offer a\nnatural resolution to the overshoot problem.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nRecent experimental data [1] provides evidence for an early universe inflation [2, 3, 4] and\nquite remarkably even makes predictions about some of the parameters that characterize\nmodels of inflation.\nString theory, however, does not seem to provide, as yet, a particularly natural setup\nfor inflation (for reviews of recent progress see [5, 6]). The basic issue is that in order to\ngenerate a large amount of inflation, typically, the expectation value of the inflaton needs\nto vary over super-Planckian distances which is not easy to achieve in string theory where\nthe inflaton usually has a geometrical meaning.\nRecently [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] it was realized that there is a relatively simple way to evade\nthe super-Planckian problem in string theory (for earlier work in the context of MSSM\nsee [12, 13, 14]). If the inflaton potential has an inflection point (or an almost inflection\nregion) then a large amount of inflation will be generated around the inflection point\n(region), provided that the inflaton spends enough time in this region. Thus if the initial\ncondition for the inflaton is near the inflection point, then the number of e-foldings will\nbe large (in fact, very large). However, if the initial condition of the inflaton is away\nfrom the inflection point (which is the generic case), then the inflaton will overshoot the\ninflection point without inflating the universe. In other words, the Hubble friction is not\nsufficient to slow down the inflaton at the inflection point, and the inflaton will not spend\nenough time near the inflection point to generate inflation. This can be viewed as a limit\nof the overshoot problem discussed in [15].\nThe aim of this paper is twofold. First, we demonstrate in the context of modular\ninflation [16, 17] that there are a lot of simple examples of inflection point potentials in\nstring theory.1 Second, we show that quite generically string theory resolves the main\ndrawback of inflection point inflation - the overshoot problem discussed above. The\nnice aspect of this resolution is that it involves stringy degrees of freedom and so the\nsupergravity fields by themselves are not sufficient (for other examples of stringy degrees\nof freedom that help in stabilization of moduli fields, namely through trapping by particle\nproduction near ESPs, see [18, 19, 20, 21]).\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we summarize some of the general\nfeatures of inflection point inflation that are relevant for our work. In section 3 we review\n1\n\nMore complicated example, in the context of brane inflation were discussed recently in [8, 9, 11, 10].\n\n2\n\n\fthe different terms in the potential for the radion and show that an inflection point\npotential can be easily constructed using these terms. We start section 4 by numerically\ndemonstrating the overshoot problem associated with inflection point inflation. Then\nwe describe the stringy mechanism that resolves this problem. We conclude with some\ncomments in section 5.\n\n2\n\nInflection point inflation\n\nIn this section we collect some of the general properties of inflection point inflation (IPI).\nMost of the observations made in this section can be found in [12, 13, 14].\nWe assume that the inflaton, denoted by \u03c6, has a canonically normalized kinetic term\nand a potential with an inflection point at \u03c6inf lection . Therefore the potential near \u03c6inf lection\ntakes the form\nV (\u03c6) = Vinf lection \u2212 \u03b2(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6inf lection )3 ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nand the slow roll parameters are\n1\n\u01eb=\n2\n\nV\nV\n\n\u2032\n\n!2\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n9\u03b2 2 (\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6inf lection )4\n,\n=\n2\n2Vinf\nlection\n\nV\n6\u03b2(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6inf lection )\n\u03b7=\n.\n=\u2212\nV\nVinf lection\n\n(2.2)\n\nWe see that near \u03c6inf lection the conditions for slow roll inflation are satisfied, and that\n\u01eb \u226a \u03b7. This will play a role momentarily.\n\nTheoretically the nicest feature of IPI is that during inflation the expectation value of\n\u03c6 need not vary over super-Planckian distances as can be seen from\nN=\n\nZ\n\nVinf lection\nV\n.\n\u2032 d\u03c6 \u2248\nV\n3\u03b2(\u03c6start \u2212 \u03c6inf lection )\n\n(2.3)\n\nThis is of particular importance in string theory where the inflaton typically has either\na direct or indirect (U-dual) geometrical meaning, which makes it problematic to vary it\nover super-Planckian distances.\nAt a more practical level the big advantage of IPI is that if the low energy approximation one uses is valid at \u03c6inf lection then it is valid throughout the period of inflation. In\nthe context of string theory this means that if the supergravity approximation is valid at\n\u03c6inf lection then it can be used to describe the whole process of inflation (but not necessarily\nof re-heating). This is in contrast with other models of inflation where, typically, the need\n\n3\n\n\fto generate a large number of e-foldings pushes the inflaton either away from the region\nof validity of the approximation or away from the region of slow roll.\nAs far as observation goes the sharpest prediction of IPI is that the spectral index,\nns , is smaller than 1 by a considerable amount. This is obtained from the following\nconsideration. In the slow roll approximation the spectral index is given by\nns \u2248 1 \u2212 6\u01eb + 2\u03b7 \u2248 1 + 2\u03b7 \u2248 1 \u2212\n\n12\u03b2(\u03c6start \u2212 \u03c6inf lection )\n,\nVinf lection\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere we have used the fact that \u01eb \u226a \u03b7. Combining this with (2.3) we find that\nns \u2248 1 \u2212\n\n4\n\u2248 0.933,\nN\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere the last estimate is for N = 60. This value of ns is within the range of current\nobservational limits that give (for small r) ns = 0.95 \u00b1 0.02.\n\nIt would have been great if eq.(2.5) was a sharp prediction of IPI. This, however, is not\nthe case since there are at least two kinds of corrections to eq.(2.5) that are not negligible.\nThe first is due to the fact that a more generic situation is to have an approximate\ninflection point than an exact inflection point. This will clearly modify the prediction for\n\nns . The second modification is due to time dependent potentials that appear in string\ntheory and will play a key role in the present paper. Thus eq.(2.5) should not be viewed\nas an exact prediction of the models discussed here. However, since both modifications\nare expected to be small, the fact that ns is smaller than 1 by a significant amount is a\nprediction of the models of (almost) IPI.\nAs mentioned above a key feature of IPI is that the universe inflates only when \u03c6 \u223c\n\u03c6inf lection . This implies that models of IPI are highly sensitive to the initial condition. If\nthe initial condition is such that \u03c6initial is near \u03c6inf lection then the model works fine, in\nthe sense that N is large. But for generic values of \u03c6initial the inflaton acquires a large\nvelocity by the time it reaches \u03c6inf lection and it simply crosses the inflection point without\ninflating the universe. Simply put, the inflaton overshoots the inflection point. It is the\npurpose of this paper to show that stringy realizations of IPI resolve this problem.\nFor later use we also mention that the COBE normalization condition gives\nV0\n\u2248 0.33 108 N 4 .\n\u03b22\n\n(2.6)\n\nIn the next section we shall see that it is easy to satisfy this condition in the stringy\nmodels of inflection point inflation.\n4\n\n\f3\n\nIPI in string theory\n\nOur goal in this section is to show that models of IPI can be found in string theory. In the\ncontext of brane inflation this was shown in [8, 9, 10]. Here we focus on modular inflation\nin which one of the moduli fields is the inflaton and the other moduli fields are assumed\nto be stabilized with a higher mass than the characteristic mass scale associated with the\ninflaton (for a recent review on moduli stabilization see [22]). We consider the case where\nthe inflaton is the radion. We start by summarizing the various known contributions to\nthe potential of the radion, and then we show that they can be combined to yield IPI.\nThe setup we work with is the usual one with a compact manifold M of dimension\nd = 6. For simplicity we assume that the compact manifold is characterized by one length\nscale, L, and so the volume of M is VolM = cLd , where c is a dimensionless constant of\norder one.\nBefore we discuss the various ways to generate a potential for L we recall that it is\nuseful to describe the potential in the Einstein frame, where the kinetic term for L does\nnot mix with the kinetic term of the graviton. This ensures that the potential we find for\nL can be interpreted in the standard way. We start with the Einstein-Hilbert action in\ns = 4 + d dimensions and KK reduce it to four dimensions to find\n1\n16\u03c0Gs\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\nd x gs Rs ,\ns\n\n\u21d2\n\nc\n16\u03c0Gs\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\nd4 x g4 R4 Ld .\n\n(3.1)\n\nWe see that in this frame the four dimensional Newton constant is Gs /(cLd ), and so\nit depends on the expectation value of the four dimensional field L. To suppress this\ndependence we rescale the metric\ng4\u03bc\u03bd \u2192 gE\u03bc\u03bd = (L/L0 )d g4\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere L0 is a constant. This leads to the standard 4d EH action\ncLd0\nS1 =\n16\u03c0Gs\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\nd4 x gE RE ,\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere the 4D Newton constant does not depend on the expectation value of L\nGN =\n\nGs\n.\ncLd0\n\n(3.4)\n\nNow that the kinetic terms of L and the graviton do not mix we can turn to the various\nstatic contributions to V (L).\n5\n\n\f\u2022 Contributions due to (3+p)-branes:\nBy (3+p)-branes we mean branes that wrap p cycles in M and all the four non-compact\ndirections. Namely, from a four dimensional perspective these are space-filling branes.\nTheir action in the frame (3.1) is\nNp+3 T3+p\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\nd4 x g4 Lp ,\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere Np+3 is the number of (3+p)-branes and T3+p is their tension. To find the potential\nin the Einstein frame we rescale (3.2). This rescaling gives a factor of (L0 /L)d/2 for each\nof the four non-compact directions. Therefore the potential is\nV3+p = N3+p T3+p L2d\n0\n\n1\nL2d\u2212p\n\n.\n\n(3.6)\n\nIt is interesting to note that this potential goes to zero in the decompactification limit\n(L \u2192 \u221e). This is a somewhat counterintuitive result since in this limit the size of the\n\nbrane blows up like Lp and so does the action (3.5). It is only due to the rescaling to the\nEinstein frame that the potential vanishes.\n\u2022 Contributions due to l-fluxes:\nThe relevant term in the 4 + d dimensional action is\nZ\n\n\u221a\nds x gs cl Fl2 ,\n\n(3.7)\n\nwhere the cl 's are constants that typically depend on the value of the other moduli. Now\nR\n\nsuppose that we have N units of Fl (i.e. l\u2212cycle Fl = Nl ) then we find in the 4d effective\naction (in the Einstein frame) the following potential for L\nVl\u2212f lux = Nl2 cl L2d\n0\n\n1\nLd+2l\n\n.\n\n(3.8)\n\n\u2022 Contributions due to the curvature of M:\nThe EH action in 4 + d leads also to the following term in 4D\n1\nGs\nOn dimensional ground\n\nR\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\nd4 x g4 (L0 /L)2d ( dd x gd Rd ).\nZ\n\n(3.9)\n\n\u221a\ndd x gd Rd = kM Ld\u22122 where kM is a dimensionless parameter\n\nthat (depending on the topology of M) can be negative zero or positive. Thus we find\nVcur =\n\n1\nkM L2d\n0\n.\nd+2\nGs L\n6\n\n(3.10)\n\n\fNote that when M is a CY manifold kM vanishes.\nThere are also non-perturbative contributions due to (-1+p)-branes and gaugino condensation. These are exponentially small in L and will not play a role here.\nWhen attempting to use these potentials to construct models of inflation it is important\nto make sure that the scalar is canonically normalized. This ensures that also in dynamical\nsituations, such as inflation, the potential has the usual interpretation. In the case at hand\nwe denote the canonically normalized scalar field associated with L by \u03c6 and the two are\nrelated in the following way (for d = 6)\nL = e\u03b1\u03c6\n\n1\n\u03b1= \u221a .\n24\n\nwith\n\n(3.11)\n\nBefore discussing IPI let us show that none of the terms discussed above leads to\ninflation by itself. With a single contribution V (L) takes the form\n\uf8eb s\n\n\uf8f6\n\n2 \uf8f8\nV0\n\u03c6\nV (\u03c6) = C = V0 exp \uf8ed\u2212\nL\nk\n\nk = 48/C 2.\n\nwith\n\n(3.12)\n\nSuch a potential is known to yield exact cosmological solutions [23]. For a flat universe\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + a(t)2 dx2i\n\ni = 1, 2, 3\n\n(3.13)\n\nwe have\na(t) = a0 tk ,\ns\n\u221a\n\u03c6 = 2k log\n\n(3.14)\n!\n\nV0\nt ,\nk(3k \u2212 1)\n\nwhich implies a universe with\n\nP\n2\n= \u22121 + ,\n(3.15)\n\u03c1\n3k\nwhere as usual P is the pressure and \u03c1 is the energy density. Since all the examples\nw=\n\nmentioned above have C \u2265 7 and since the condition for an accelerating universe is k > 1\nwe see from (3.12) that none of the stringy contributions to V (L) give an accelerating\nuniverse, let alone a universe with ns close to 1.2 This is believed [24] to be a general\nresult valid for all moduli, not necessarily the radion.\n2\n\nMoreover even if there was a stringy potential with a small enough C to accelerate the universe there\nwould still be the problem of a graceful exit. Namely, with such a potential inflation will not end. This\nis, of course, interesting for models of quintessence but not for inflation.\n\n7\n\n\fIt is therefore particularly interesting that a combination of these potentials can give\nan inflection point inflation. For this to happen we need the potential to get contributions\nfrom three terms\nV = a1 exp(j1 \u03b1\u03c6) + a2 exp(j2 \u03b1\u03c6) + a3 exp(j3 \u03b1\u03c6),\n\n(3.16)\n\nwith, say, j1 > j2 > j3 , a1 , a3 > 0 and a2 < 0.\nNote that the requirement a2 < 0 can be satisfied since not all the terms discussed\nabove are positive definite. Vcur , for example, can be negative. When L is small this\nmight lead to some non-trivial effects [25, 26] due to winding modes that become light. We,\nhowever, are interested in the large L case in which nothing dramatic is expected to happen\nif Vcur is negative. Another way to generate a negative potential is via orientifolds. Their\ntension is negative and so they induce negative V3+p . This puts some mild constraints on\nthe possible values of N3+p that can be satisfied. To conclude, using Vp+3 , Vl\u2212f lux and\nVcur one can construct many examples of inflection point inflation in string theory.\nFor concreteness in the rest of the paper we focus on a particular example with j1 = 12,\nj2 = 10 and j3 = 8. We emphasize, however, that the conclusions we present below do\nnot depend on this particular choice. In particular, the stringy resolution of the overshoot\nproblem works equally well for other choices of j1 , j2 and j3 .\n\u221a\nFor j1 = 12, j2 = 10 and j3 = 8 an inflection point at \u03c6 = \u03c6inf lection = 24 log(Linf lection )\nis obtained if we take\n2\na1\n= L4inf lection ,\na3\n3\n\na2\n8\n= \u2212 L2inf lection .\na3\n5\n\n(3.17)\n\nSince an overall rescalling of the potential does not change \u03c6inf lection only ratios of the a's\nappear in this condition. From (3.17) we see that, as expected, to have a potential with\nan inflection point we need to fine tune the parameters in the potential\na22\n96\n= .\na1 a3\n25\n\n(3.18)\n\nIn the last section we shall see that this condition can be relaxed.\nExpanding near the inflection point we find that\nV0 =\n\na3\n15L8inf lection\n\n\u221a\na3 24\n\u03b2=\n,\n54L8inf lection\n\n,\n\n8\n\n(3.19)\n\n\fwhere we are using the notation of eq. (2.1), and so the COBE normalization condition,\n(2.6), gives\n\u221a\n1/8\nN,\n(3.20)\nLinf lection \u2248 6.7 a3\nwhich implies that for typical values of a3 the supergravity approximation is valid. This\nis not surprising since usually the COBE normalization condition implies that the energy\nscale associated with inflation is a few orders of magnitude smaller than the Planck scale.\n\n4\n\nThe overshoot problem and its stringy resolution\n\nAs explained above the main drawback of models of IPI is that they suffer from the\novershoot problem. This problem is generic and appears also in the stringy realization\nof models of IPI discussed in the previous section. This is illustrated in figure 1. In this\nfigure we see how sensitive inflation is to the initial condition. If the initial condition\nis near the inflection point then the number of e-foldings, N, is large. But if the initial\ncondition is even slightly away from the inflection point, inflation does not occur since\n\u03c6 overshoots \u03c6inf lection . Interestingly enough string theory provides a simple dynamical\nresolution to this problem which we shall now discuss.\nIn the previous section we described some of the static terms in V (L). There are,\nhowever, also time dependent contributions to V (L). These are due to particles with\nmasses that depend on L. Denoting the particle densities by ni , the potential they induce\nis\nVi (L, t) = ni (t)mi (L).\n(4.1)\nThis potential is time-dependent because ni (t) dilutes as the universe expands\nni (t) \u223c\n\n1\na3 (t)\n\n.\n\n(4.2)\n\nMost known examples in string theory, such as perturbative states, yield m(L) \u2192 0 in the\n\ndecompactified limit, and so Vi (L, t) vanishes in this limit and does not help much with the\novershoot problem. However, non-perturbatively there are (0+p)-branes (namely, branes\nthat wrap p cycles in M and are point-like objects in the four dimensional uncompactified\nspace-time) with m(L) \u2192 \u221e in the decompactified limit.\nTo be precise the mass of a (0+p)-brane is\nm0+p = T0+p Lp\n9\n\n\u0012\n\nL0\nL\n\n\u0013d/2\n\n,\n\n(4.3)\n\n\f9\n11\n\n10\n8\n9\n\n7\n\n8\n\n7\n6\n6\n\n5\n5\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n\n6000\n\n8000\n\n10000\n\n12000\n\n14000\n\n16000\n\n18000\n\n20000\n\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n\n6000\n\n8000\n\n10000\n\n12000\n\n14000\n\n16000\n\n18000\n\n20000\n\nFigure 1: A numerical illustration of the overshoot problem: In both cases we take\nLinf lection = 3 and display \u03c6 as a function of time. In the picture to the left we\ntake \u03c6initial = 12\n\u03c6\nand obtain a decent amount of inflation when \u03c6 crosses\n13 inf lection\n\u03c6inf lection \u2248 5.38. In the picture to the right we take \u03c6initial = 67 \u03c6inf lection . Despite\nthe fact that this is fairly close to \u03c6inf lection inflation is not generated.\nwhere T0+p is the tension of the brane. The factor of Lp is due to the volume of brane,\nwhile the (L0 /L)d/2 factor is due to the transformation to the Einstein frame (coming\n\u221a\nfrom the gtt in the particle action). We see that, unlike in the case of (3+p)-branes\n(3.6), now, for p > d/2, the volume term dominates and we find that m(L) \u2192 \u221e in the\ndecompactification limit. Therefore, such (0+p)-branes lead to time dependent potentials\nthat blow up when L \u2192 \u221e\nV0+p = n0+p T0+p L30 Lp\u22123 .\n(4.4)\nWe would like to argue now that this kind of time dependent potential is exactly what\nis needed to resolve the overshoot problem of IPI. The basic idea is simple and illustrated\nin figure 2. The static piece of the potential is denoted by the red/solid line and the time\ndependent piece of the potential by the green/dashed line. In (a),(b) the static potential\nis steep, but since there has not been significant expansion the time-dependant potential\nis able to balance it, preventing \u03c6(t) from acquiring a large velocity. Heuristically, \u03c6(t)\n(denoted by the blue/filled circle) follows the dilution of the time dependent potential.\nIn (c) \u03c6(t) enters the shallow region (where the slow roll parameters are small) where\ninflation takes place and the time dependent potential starts to slow down exponentially.\nIn (d) \u03c6(t) is dominated solely by the static potential but its velocity is now low enough\nto allow prolonged inflation.\nTo see if this heuristic argument actually holds we have to solve the equations of\n\n10\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 2: A heuristic demonstration of how a time dependent potential, that scales like\n1/a3 (t), can resolve the overshoot problem of IPI.\nmotion which for a flat FRW universe are (we take the reduced Planck mass to be 1)\n1 2\n\u03c6\u0307 + Vstatic + V0+p ,\n2\n\u1e450+p = \u22123Hn0+p ,\nd\n\u03c6\u0308 + 3H \u03c6\u0307 = \u2212 (Vstatic + V0+p )\nd\u03c6\n3H 2 =\n\n(4.5)\n\nwhere Vstatic is given by (3.16, 3.17) with j1 = 12, j2 = 10, j3 = 8 and V0+p by (4.4). We\nassume that other moduli fields, in particular the dilaton, are not too extreme and so all\nthe constants that appear in Vstatic and V0+p are of order 1 in string units. We will get\nback to this point momentarily.\nThe question that we wish to address is whether a generic initial condition will give\na large enough N to be consistent with experiment. Since we are working within the\nsupergravity approximation, the approximation breaks down at L < 1. This means that\nwe should take Linf lection > 1 (for the approximation to be valid during inflation) and\nthat the most natural initial condition is Linitial \u223c 1 (which gives \u03c6initial \u223c 0). Recall that\nthe illustration in the beginning of this section shows (for n0+p = 0) that for these kind\nof initial conditions the inflaton overshoots the inflection point and the universe does not\ninflate. In fact figure 1 shows that this happens already when Linitial /Linf lection = 6/7.\nTo see what happens for n0+p > 0 we have to solve (4.5) numerically. On general\ngrounds we expect ninitial\u2212min\n, which is the minimal initial value of n0+p (with \u03c6initial = 0\n0+p\nand \u03c6\u0307initial = 0) that is needed to generate a significant amount of inflation, to become\nsmaller as we increase Linf lection . The reason is simply that Vstatic becomes weaker at large\nL while V0+p becomes stronger.\nThe table below summarizes our findings for p = 6, a3 = 1 and N = 100\n11\n\n\fLinf lection\nninitial\u2212min\n0+6\n\n2\n\n5\n\n8\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n0.098877 0.005431 0.00081 0.000316 0.000054 0.000015 0.000005\n\nWe see that the needed values of ninitial\nare small and become smaller and smaller as we\n0+p\nincrease Linf lection . This is particularly important because it implies that in the supergravity region, Linf lection \u226b 1, a tiny ninitial\nis sufficient to slow down \u03c6 enough by the\n0+p\ninflection point for the universe to inflate significantly.\nThe nice feature of this mechanism is that a small ninitial\nis expected to be generated\n0+p\nby quantum effects and need not be imposed by hand! The reason is the following.\nWhen Linitial \u223c 1 the Hawking temperature associated with the initial vacuum energy is\n\u221a\nTH \u223c Vinitial \u223c 1. Since the mass of the (0 + p) -brane is also of order 1 we expect\nninitial\nto be of order 1 as well. Thus ninitial\nbigger than the values that appear in the\n0+p\n0+p\ntable above is expected to be generated quantum mechanically.\nThis discussion depends, of course, on the value of the other moduli that we assumed\nto be stabilized. In particular the value of the dilaton has a significant effect since TH \u223c g\n2\nwhile M0+p \u223c 1/g, and so a natural ninitial\nscales like e\u2212M0+p /TH \u223c e\u22121/g . This means\n0+p\n\nthat one cannot send the string coupling constant to zero while fixing Linf lection . However,\nas the table above shows, for a large enough Linf lection we can have g that is considerably\nsmaller than 1.\n\n5\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nWe end with some comments:\n\u2022 Our numerical simulations indicate that the mechanism described here works quite\ngenerally. For example it works fine also for 3 < p < 6, though it is not as efficient in the\nsense that ninitial\u2212min\nis a bit larger than ninitial\u2212min\n. As mentioned above it also works\n0+p\n0+6\nfor other choices of j1 , j2 and j3 .\n\u2022 Here we focused on the case where the radion is the inflaton and show that models of IPI\nare common in string theory and resolve the overshoot problem. It should be interesting\nto see if this can be generalized to other setups of IPI. A particularly interesting one is\nthe one of [8, 9, 10].\n\u2022 Taking ninitial\nto be bigger than ninitial\u2212min\nby a factor of order 1 leads to N that is\n0+6\n0+6\npractically infinite. This implies that a large enough N is generated with rather generic\n12\n\n\finitial conditions even when the potential does not have an exact inflection point but\nrather an approximated inflection region. Namely, eq. (3.18) can be relaxed. Thus one\nneeds to tune but not fine tune the parameters in the potentials. This also means that\nstringy corrections to the potential are unlikely to change our main conclusions. The fact\nthat eq. (3.18) can be relaxed is particularly important since a1 , a2 and a3 are quantized\nonce all other moduli are fixed (which is our working assumption).\nTo demonstrate this behavior, we explore the range of deviation from the exact inflection point parameters in our example above that would still allow enough e-foldings\n1\n. The table below shows the maximal deviation for a1 per\n(N > 60) with ninitial\n= 100\n0+6\nvalue of Linf lection , according to a1 = a1 + \u03b4a1 (we allow a1 to vary in the direction that\ncauses V to lose its extremal point and monotonically approach zero):\n\nLinf lection\n\u03b4a1\n\n5\n\n8\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20 25\n\n0.01 0.08 0.2\n\n1\n\n3\n\n8\n\nWe see that as we increase Linf lection the sensitivity to the parameters of the potential\ndecreases, and in particular since \u03b4a1 is of order 1 the quantization conditions of the ai 's\ncan be satisfied.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank O.
