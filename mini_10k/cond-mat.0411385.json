Assuming an asymmetric potential, we show the existence of a regime in which the\nsystems dynamic displays excitability by calculating the relevant residence time distributions and\ncorrelation times. Experimentally we then observe this behaviour in the polarization dynamics of\na vertical cavity surface emitting laser with opto-electronic feedback. Extending these observations\nto two-dimensional systems with dispersive coupling we finally show numerically that delay induced\nexcitability can lead to the appearance of propagating wave-fronts and spirals.\nPACS numbers: 05.40.Ca., 05.45.-a, 42.65.Pc, 42.65.Sf\n\nThe influence of time delayed feedback on the dynamics of otherwise Markovian processes with noise is currently a very active topic of research, as memory effects\nhave been found to be important in many systems in areas ranging from biology to medicine and electronics [1].\nEven though many of the general properties of systems\nwith memory are still unexplored, various methods for\nengineering of the delay to induce instabilities or stabilize complex dynamics have already been suggested [2].\nAs a generic model to study the effects of delay on\na bi-stable stochastic system one can consider a particle trapped in a double well potential. In the absence\nof feedback the particle makes random transitions between the two minima of the potential and two consecutive jumps can be considered as being independed of\neach other. When feedback is present, however, correlations are introduced into the system and the dynamics\nbecomes inherently non-Markovian. Let us consider the\nfollowing standard stochastic differential equation\n\u1e8b = \u2212\n\ndU\n+ \u01ebx(t \u2212 \u03c4 ) + \u03b7(t),\ndx\n\n(1)\n\nwhich describes an over-damped motion in a double well\npotential U (x) under the influence of memory. The\nlength of the delay interval is \u03c4 and \u01eb is the feedback\nstrength. Here \u03b7(t) describes Gaussian white noise with\nh\u03b7(t)i = 0 and h\u03b7(t)\u03b7(t\u2032 )i = 2D\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ). In the following\nwe will denote the delayed state as x\u03c4 = x(t \u2212 \u03c4 ).\nWithout delay (\u01eb = 0), the random switching between\nthe two minima of the potential, xl,r , can be very well\ndescribed by Kramers' theory [3]. The residence time\ndistribution (RTD) Pl,r (T ) in each well is then given by\nPl,r (T ) = \u03b3l,r e\u2212\u03b3l,r T ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the inverse of the switching rate is the so-called\nKramers' time, Tl,r = 1/\u03b3l,r . It describes the average\ntime between two transitions\n2\u03c0\nexp [\u2206Ul,r /D] .\nTl,r = p\n\u2032\u2032\nU (xl,r )U \u2032\u2032 (x0 )\n\nHere x0 is the position of the local maximum between\nthe two minima xl,r and \u2206Ul,r = U (x0 ) \u2212 U (xl,r ) is the\npotential barrier for each well.\nThe statistical properties of eq. (1) for \u01eb 6= 0 have\nrecently been analysed in the case of the generic symmetric potential U (x) = \u2212x2 /2 + x4 /4. Noting that\nthe potential can be rewritten to include the delay term,\nV (x) = U (x)+ \u01ebx x\u03c4 , it can immediately be seen that the\npotential barrier, and therefore the escape rates, become\ndependent on the state at the earlier time t\u2212\u03c4 [4]. Hence,\nthe continuous system of eq. (1) can be approximated by\na discrete two-state model, r(t) = \u00b11, with transition\nrates that depend on the delayed state [5]. These rates\ndepend on the relative value of r(t) and r(t \u2212 \u03c4 ) and are\ndefined as p1 if r(t) = r(t \u2212 \u03c4 ) and p2 if r(t) 6= r(t \u2212 \u03c4 )\nfor a symmetric potential. Tsimring and Pikovsky have\nrecently derived the power spectrum for this model and\nshown the existence of coherence resonance [5]. Other\nworks have calculated and measured the RTD [4, 6, 7].\nHere we show that the presence of an asymmetry in\nthe potential can lead to the appearance of excitability\n[8]. In an excitable system a perturbation above a certain\nthreshold transfers an otherwise stable steady-state (the\nresting state) into an excited state (the firing state). The\nsystem then goes through a well defined refractory cycle,\nbefore returning to its initial state. During the refractory\n\n(3)\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Schematic definition of Kramers' residence times\nfor an asymmetric potential without (upper graph) and with\n(lower graphs) negative feedback.

Systems following this kind of\ndynamics are widespread in biology, chemistry and many\nother areas and there are several mathematical models\nexisting to describe such dynamics [8]. It is worth pointing out, that for noise driven excitable systems different\nmanifestations of a higher degree of order at a finite noise\nlevel have been discovered, for example coherence resonance [9] and wavefronts and even self-ordered patterns\nlike spirals in spatially extended systems [10] .\nFor the asymmetric potential the presence of feedback\nleads to a dependence of the amplitude of each potential\nbarrier on the position of the particle at the time t\u2212\u03c4 and\nthe dynamics has to be described by four characteristic\n\u00b1\ntimes Tl,r\n. The times Tl+ and Tl\u2212 are the mean escape\ntimes from the left well when the particle was in the left\nor right well at t \u2212 \u03c4 , respectively, and Tr\u2212 and Tr+ are\nthe mean escape times from the right well if the particle\nwas in the left or right well at t \u2212 \u03c4 , respectively (see\nFig. 1a).\nEven though all transitions are inherently stochastic,\nwe show below that for negative feedback (\u01eb < 0) a parameter region exists, in which the systems displays excitable behaviour. To illustrate this let us consider the\ncase of an asymmetric potential with Tr \u226a Tl (for \u01eb = 0)\nsuch that the minimum corresponding to x < 0 exists for\nany value of the feedback, x\u03c4 , but the minimum for x > 0\nonly exists for x\u03c4 < 0 (see Fig. 1b). Let us also assume\nthat the particle has been in the left well for t < 0 and\nit is driven by noise into the right well at t = 0. For\nsmall noise amplitudes (Tr\u2212 \u226b \u03c4 ) the particle will almost\ncertainly remain in the right well until the value of the\nfeedback term changes at t = \u03c4 . The potential minimum\non the right hand side then disappears and the particle\nwill move toward the remaining minimum at x < 0. After a further time interval \u03c4 , the potential will switch to\nits initial bi-stable shape and the above process can start\nover again. Such a cycle is characteristic of an excitable\nsystem. The initial state is stable under small perturbations but large perturbations can induce a jump. The\nfiring corresponds to the transition of the particle into\nthe right well and the refractory time consists of the two\nsubsequent periods of duration \u03c4 before the initial state\nis established again. During the first one the refractory\ntime the particle resides in the well x > 0, from which\ntransitions are unlikely and during the second one only\none minimum is present and transitions cannot occur.\nTo show that the dynamics described above can indeed\nbe observed from eq. (1) we have numerically calculated\nthe RTDs in the excitable regime (see Fig. 2). The potential was chosen to be\n\n1\n\n0.5\n0\n1.8\n\n2\n\n2.2\n\nT\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nT\nFIG. 2: Numerical RTDs for the left (full line) and right well\n(dashed line).

From there no further\ntransition is possible until at a time \u03c4 later the potential\nchanges back to its bistable shape (full line in Fig. 2).\nAfter that the distribution for t > \u03c4 follows Kramers'\nlaw. Fig. 2 clearly shows the existence of a refractory\ntime that forbids firing twice in an interval of 2\u03c4 .\nLet us compare our continuous system to a discrete\nmodel. Although the simplest discrete model to describe\nexcitability can be constructed using a two-state system,\nit was recently shown, that networks of excitable units\ndisplay a wider spectrum of dynamical effects when they\nare approximated by three state models [11, 12]. In these\nmodels only the transition from the resting into the firing state is stochastic, while the other two transitions\nare deterministic with fixed waiting times. It is clear\nfrom the discussion above that such a model is very close\nto our bistable system with feedback. Even though all\ntransitions in the potential are at all times inherently\nstochastic, the two intervals during the cycle in which\nthe transition probability is very low can be well approximated by a waiting time of length Tw = \u03c4 (see Fig. 2).\nTo compare the power spectra we will assume that the\nstochastic output of the discrete model is described by a\nfunction that has a value 1 if the system is in the firing\nstate and is zero otherwise. The spectrum can then be\ncalculated analytically [18]\nS(\u03c9) =\n\n(\u03b3 +\n\n2\u03b3 2 \u03c4 )(1\n\n2 \u2212 2 cos(\u03c9\u03c4 )\n\u2212 cos(2\u03c9\u03c4 ) + \u03c9\u03b3 sin(2\u03c9\u03c4 ) +\n\n\u03c92\n2\u03b3 2 )\n\n(5)\nFig. 3 shows the power spectrum given by eq. (5) (upper graph) and calculated from numerical simulations of\neq. (1) with the potential of eq. (4) (lower graph). Both\ncurves are similar in shape and show their maxima close\nto odd multiples of \u03c0 and minima at even multiples of\n\n\f3\n\nS(\u03c9)\n\nS(\u03c9)\n\n15\n\n10\n3\u03c0\n\nC\n\n2\u03c0\n\n\u03c4\n\nC\n\n\u03c0\n\nS(\u03c9)\n\nS(\u03c9)\n\n5\n\n\u03c0\n\n0\n\n\u03c0\n\n2\u03c0\n\n2\u03c0\n\n3\u03c0\n\n3\u03c0\n\n\u03c9\n\n0\n\n4\u03c0\n\n\u03c0. However, it must be noted that for the discrete model\nthe coherence is an increasing function with noise [11, 12],\nwhile for the continuous model it is maximized for a finite strength of the noise. To demonstrate this resonance\nwe have calculated the autocorrelation function and the\nassociated correlation times, \u03c4C , as a function of noise\nstrength. The correlation time is defined as the integral\nover the square of the autocorrelation function [9]\nTc =\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n\u0014\n\nhx\u0303(t)x\u0303(t + t\u2032 )i\nhx\u0303(t)2 i\n\n\u00152\n\ndt\u2032 ,\n\n100\n\nt/\u03c4\n\nFIG. 3: Power spectrum of the discrete (upper) and the continuous model (lower).

This\nbehaviour is closely related to the appearance of a phase\ntransition from excitable to oscillatory media [13, 14].\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\n\nExcitability has been observed in the intensity of semiconductor lasers with optical feedback [16]. Here we experimentally analyse the behaviour of the polarisation\ndynamics of a Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser\n(VCSEL) with opto-electronic feedback as described in\n[4, 7]. The light emitted by a VCSEL is usually linearly polarised but, as the injection current increases,\nthe emission axis will switch between the two orthogonal states. Around this switching point one can find a\ncurrent range in which the light polarisation randomly\nswitches between the two axes.

For the uppermost curve D = 0.01 which\nincreases downwards in steps of \u2206D = 0.005. Right: correlation times. The maximum is a clear sign of ordering.\n\nhave been designed using these lasers to study Kramers'\nlaw [15], stochastic resonance [17] and the properties of\nnoisy time delay dynamical systems [4, 7]. It is worthwhile noticing that the shape of the potential depends\non the bias current applied to the laser. At the center\nof the bistable region both polarisations occur with the\nsame probability and the associated potential is symmetric. The potential becomes asymmetric as the injection\ncurrent is varied toward the boundary of the the bistable\nregion and our laser was operated in this region in order\nto observe delay-induced excitability.\nAlthough spontaneous polarisation switching was observed without the addition of external noise, a noise\ngenerator was added in order to observe coherence resonance. Fig. 5 (left) shows the measured RTDs for the\nlowest noise in the excitable regime where Px , Py refer to\nthe orthogonal linear polarisation states. The important\nfeature is the absence of switching events for times less\nthan \u03c4 . Additionally, both the stochastic nature of the\nfiring transition and deterministic nature of the refractory cycle can be seen in the spread of switching times\nbeing much less for Py than Px . Coherence resonance for\nthis operating point is shown in Fig. 5 (right) and qualitatively reproduces the predicted numerical behaviour.\n\nTWO-DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS\n\nThe ability to sustain spatio-temporal patterns in systems of coupled stochastic units is an important property of excitable systems [10]. It was shown that wavepropagation and spiral patterns [19] are common in excitable systems and here we confirm their existence for\nspatially coupled elements as described by eq. (1). We\nconsider a situations where the elements are coupled via\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 5: Left: Experimental RTDs for the x and y polarization\nof the VCSEL. Excitability is clearly visible from absence of\nresidence times shorter than \u03c4 .

At some point the noise will trigger\none of the elements to fire and the coupling to neighboring elements will lead to short time correlations: in\norder to reduce the 'kinetic energy' between two neighbouring elements they will also undergo a transition into\nthe firing state. After the refractory time the elements\nwill transfer back in the initial state, marking the end\nof the wave-front. However, due to higher order effects\nin the feedback strength [7], the states at the end of the\nrefractory time do not have the same Kramers' time as\nthe initial ones. In fact, for negative feedback the new\nKramers' time is much smaller and these elements are\nmore prone to being excited again. This leads to the\ncontinuous creation of wave surfaces with wavelength \u03c4 .\nIn Fig. 6 (left) we show two examples of such wave surfaces, where the delay time of the system on the right\nis twice as long as in the system shown on the left hand\nside. The two dominating colors represent the two refractory states for s > 0 and s < 0. It is clear that these\nordered waves can only be sustained at an optimal noise\nlevel. Too little noise will not lead to any excitations\nwhereas too much noise will lead to fragmentation of the\nwavefronts.\nInstead of using noise to trigger the spatial ordering, one can also choose appropriate initial conditions.\nHere we demonstrate the appearance of spiral patterns\nby preparing a system with one area where the elements\nhave just fired after having been in the resting state for\n[\u2212\u03c4, 0[ . A neighboring area has just made the transition\nback into the resting state, while having been in the refractory state for [\u2212\u03c4, 0[. The rest of the system is in the\nresting state and has been there for [\u2212\u03c4, 0] (see Fig. 6\n(right)). Integrating from these intial conditions leads to\nthe evolution of a spiral as shown on the right hand side\nin Fig. 6.\nIn summary we have shown that including delay into\nbistable systems can lead to excitable behaviour. We\n\nFIG. 6: Left: Two dimensional wave-surfaces. The delay time\nin the left panel is twice the value of the delay time in the\nright panel. Right: Spiral pattern emerging from the initial\ncondition (left panel) as described in the text.

The parameters here are\n\u03c4 = 80, \u01eb = 0.343, \u03ba = 0.07 and D = 0.\n\nhave theoretically investigated the model of an asymmetric double well potentials and found clear signatures of\nexcitability in the RTD. We have also compared the continuous to a discrete model for excitability and found\ngood agreement of the power spectra. We have calculated the coherence times and shown the existence of\ncoherence resonance. Experimentally we have demonstrated the above behaviour using a VCSEL in the bistable regime.For spatially extended coupled systems we\nhave demonstrated the appearance of spatio-temporal order in the form of waves and spirals.\nThis work was supported by Science Foundation Ireland under contract number sfi/01/fi/co.\n\n[1] A.
