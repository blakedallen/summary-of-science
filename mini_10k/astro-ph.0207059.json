In Clementini et al.

The circumstance of being far from the disc but with a period that\nfor RRab usually corresponds to roughly solar metallicity\nmade these stars fairly anomalous. The photometry presented in Paper I demonstrated however that five out of\nthe eight variables were more likely to pulsate in the first\novertone mode, and that, therefore, the short period should\nnot be taken as indicative of high metallicity. Furthermore,\nit showed that some of the stars in the sample (namely CM\nLeonis, CU, BS and BE Comae) exhibited irregularities in\ntheir light curves. In order to investigate the actual nature\nof these anomalies new observing campaigns were conducted\non these four stars. In Clementini et al. (2000, Paper II) we\nreported the discovery that CU Comae is a double-mode RR\nLyrae, the sixth detected in the field of our Galaxy and the\nmost metal-poor ever found. The present paper is devoted\nto the discussion of the results obtained for CM Leonis (CM\nLeo) from the combination of its Paper I photometry with\n\n\f2\n\nDi Fabrizio et al.\n\nnew data taken from 1995 to 1999, and from high resolution spectroscopy obtained in 1999. The observations and\ndata sets are presented in Section 2. In Section 3 we discuss the results of the analysis of the complete photometric\ndata set. In Section 4 we report the results of our spectroscopic analyses (derivation of a radial velocity curve over\nthe full pulsation cycle and elemental abundance analysis of\nthe spectra of CM Leo taken near minimum light). In section 5, we present results of the modeling of the observed\nlight and radial velocity curves of CM Leo, based on nonlinear pulsation models, computed with the same physical and\nnumerical assumptions as in Bono, Castellani & Marconi\n(2000), and derive an estimate of the stellar mass, effective\ntemperature, and distance modulus of the star. Finally, in\nSection 6 we summarize the main derived quantities of CM\nLeo and discuss the absolute magnitude we derive for the\nstar in the framework of the short and long distance scale\ndichotomy.\n\n2\n\nOBSERVATIONS AND REDUCTIONS\n\nAccording to the fourth edition of the General Catalogue\nof Variable Stars (Kholopov et al. 1985, GCVS4) CM Leo\n(\u03b12000 = 11h 56m 14.3s , \u03b42000 = 21o 15\u2032 30.2\u2032\u2032 ) is a fundamental mode RR Lyrae star (RRab) with a rather short pulsation period P=0.d 361732 and 1.10 mag amplitude in the\nphotographic light variation. Clementini et al. (1995b) obtained CCD V photometry of CM Leo in 1994. With a period\nP=0.d 361479 they basically confirmed the periodicity of the\nGCVS4, but showed that the light curve has a sinusoidal\nshape with amplitude of 0.49 mag, and appears to be split\nin two well-separated subcurves with about 0.1 mag difference in amplitude (see figure 3a in Paper I). Clementini et\nal. (1995b) concluded that CM Leo is a c-type RR Lyrae\nwith irregularities in its light curve. Three different causes\nwere suggested to possibly explain the anomaly in the light\ncurve, namely double-mode or non-radial mode pulsation\n(Olech et al. 1999), and the Blazhko effect (Blazhko 1907).\nGiven the small number of data points (71) and the short\ntime baseline (2 months), the 1994 observations were insufficient to pinpoint the actual source of the irregularities. New\nphotometry of the star was obtained from 1995 to 1999 with\nthe Loiano 1.52 m telescope operated by the Bologna Observatory, and the 60 cm of the Michigan State University\n(MSU). High resolution spectroscopy of the star was also\nobtained in 1999, with the 2.7 m telescope of the McDonald\nObservatory.\n\n2.1\n\nPhotometric data\n\nThe new photometric data of CM Leo consist of B,V,I CCD\nobservations in the Johnson-Cousins photometric system defined by Landolt (1983, 1992) standard stars, obtained with\nthe Loiano 1.52 m telescope, on 27 nights from January 1995\nto February 1999. They were complemented by 171 and 30 V\nframes obtained with the MSU 60 cm telescope in 1998 and\non two consecutive nights in February 1999, respectively. At\nboth telescopes, the 1998 campaign consisted of several consecutive nights (from 5 to 10) in three major runs about one\nmonth apart, to test both the possibility of double-mode\n\nTable 1.

In addition, the 1999 campaign\nconsisted of two nights of coordinated observations at the\nLoiano and MSU telescopes, which allowed us to obtain continuous photometry of CM Leo over 10.4 consecutive hours.\nThis interval is larger than a full pulsation cycle of CM Leo\n(8.7 hours) thus permitting us to further check on the cycleto-cycle nature of the irregularities in the light curve. On\nthese same nights high resolution spectroscopy of the star\nwas also secured with the 2.7 m telescope of the McDonald Observatory to obtain the radial velocity curve, and to\nperform a chemical abundance analysis. The journal of the\nphotometric observations is given in Table 1.\nObservations at the 1.52 m telescope were obtained with\nBFOSC (Bologna Faint Object Spectrograph & Camera)\nmounting a Thomson 1k\u00d71k CCD (0.5 arcsec/pixel, field\nof view 9.6 arcmin2 ); filters in the Johnson-Cousins photometric system were used. The field of CM Leo, taken from\na CCD image, is shown in Figure 1. Observations at the 60\ncm MSU telescope were obtained with an Apogee Ap7 CCD,\nproviding an 11 arcmin2 field of view.\nThree other objects are marked in Figure 1: the comparison stars C1, C2 and C3. Since only a small fraction of\nthe observations of CM Leo were taken in truly photometric\nconditions, the light curve of the variable has been derived\nin terms of differential magnitude with respect to these comparison stars. Data were pre-reduced, and instrumental magnitudes of the variable and comparison stars were derived by\ndirect photon counting using standard routines for aperture\nphotometry in IRAF1 . The photometric data were tied to\nthe standard photometric system through observations of 35\nstandard stars selected from Landolt (1983, 1992; for details\non the calibration procedure see Di Fabrizio 1998).\n\n2.1.1\n\nThe comparison stars\n\nThe choice of the best comparison star turned out to be a\ncrucial point in the study of the variability of CM Leo.

A 9.6 arcmin2 CCD image of the CM Leo field. The other three stars marked were used as comparison stars to obtain\ndifferential measurements of the magnitude variation of CM Leo.\n\nthe three isolated stars falling in the CCD, C1 and C2 are\nof comparable luminosity (V \u223c12.2-12.5 mag), while C3 is\nabout 2.5 mag fainter and has a redder colour (B \u2212 V \u223c 1.0\nmag). C1 was used as comparison star in Paper I. Its stability was checked at the time against star C2. However, some\ndoubts about the constancy of both C1 and C2 were present,\ndue to small trends in the instrumental VC1 \u2212 VC2 versus\nheliocentric Julian day (HJD) plots, leading to magnitude\ndifferences of the order of some hundredths of a magnitude\nfrom one run to the other. The significantly increased number of observations and the homogeneity and accuracy of the\ndata reduction procedure of the present study have allowed\nus to look into this matter in more detail.\nFigure 2 plots the differential instrumental V magnitudes of CM Leo with respect to the comparison stars C1,\nC2 and C3 (top, middle and lower panels, respectively) as a\nfunction of the HJD of observation, for the 1994-1999 dataset. The top panel includes also the 1998 MSU observations\n(crosses, 171 data-points). With only the exception of the\n1995 CM Leo\u2212C1 subset, in each year of observation data\nshown in the three panels cover the full light variation from\nmaximum to minimum light. This permits to note a variation of about 0.05-0.1 mag both in the minimum and maximum values of VCM Leo \u2212 VC1 and VCM Leo \u2212 VC2 . No variation is instead present in the VCM Leo \u2212 VC3 versus HJD\nplot. Furthermore, Figure 3 and Figure 4 show the differential instrumental V and I light curves of CM Leo with\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nrespect to the three comparison stars, with data folded according to the best fit period of the variable (P=0.361699,\nsee Section 3).\nThe scatter in the V light curve of CM Leo, measured\nby the r.m.s. from the best fit model, is reduced from 0.03\nmag when using C1 and C2 as comparison stars, to 0.02 mag\nwhen using C3. A similar effect is seen for the I light curve\n(scatter going from 0.05 down to 0.02 mag) while the effect is\nsmaller in B. The anomaly found in Paper I - a splitting of\nthe V light curve in two well-separated subcurves with about\n0.1 mag difference in amplitude - is thus solved, and details\nof the light curve variation of CM Leo, as for instance the\nhump on the ascending branch, are better defined when star\nC3 is used as reference. This suggests that light variations\nmay affect stars C1 and C2, as confirmed by the plots in\nFigure 5 where we show the instrumental differential V , B\nand I magnitudes of stars C1 and C2 with respect to star\nC3, versus the HJD of observation, of the entire data set.\nA variation of 0.05-0.20 mag is indeed present in these\nplots: the variation appears to be slightly larger for star C2\nthan for star C1, and in both cases is stronger in V and I\nand less detectable in B. The two stars may be small amplitude, long period variable stars, or they could have faint\nred companions, however a conclusion on the actual cause\nof their light variation cannot be reached from the present\ndata. In any case, we conclude that they cannot be used as\nreferences for CM Leo, whose light variation is better stud-\n\n\f4\n\nDi Fabrizio et al.\n\nFigure 2.

Coordinates and calibrated\nmagnitudes of the 3 stars in the field of CM Leo are given\nin Table 2, where the uncertainties include both the internal error contribution (about \u00b10.02 mag in all three passbands) and the systematic errors in going to the standard\nsystem (\u00b10.02 mag in V and B, and \u00b10.03 mag in I). The\nslightly larger error of the I measurements, in spite of C3\nbeing brighter in I, is due to the larger uncertainty of the I\nabsolute photometric calibration (fewer standard stars were\nobserved in I, see Di Fabrizio 1998). The stars are identified in column 2 of Table 2 by their number on the second\nversion of the Hubble Space Telescope Guide Star Catalogue\n(GSC2). Magnitudes given for C1 and C2 have been derived\nas average of all available differential measurements with respect to star C3, tied to the standard system through the\nabsolute calibration of star C3.\n\nThe light variation of CM Leo was then studied from\nthe differential photometry with respect to star C3. Photometry published for CM Leo in Paper I used star C1, so\nthe 1994 data have all been remeasured. Unfortunately, star\nC3 was not sufficiently exposed in the 1998 MSU observations, so this photometry cannot be used in the study of the\nperiod. The B, V, and I magnitudes of CM Leo relative to\nthe comparison star C3 along with the Heliocentric Julian\ndate at mid-exposure are listed in Table 3 (which will be\nprovided in its entirety through the CDS). According to the\nerrors quoted in Table 2 we estimate that the photometric\naccuracy of each individual data point is \u00b10.03 mag in V\nand B, and \u00b10.04 mag in I, including both random and\nsystematic uncertainties.\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fCM Leo\n\n5\n\nFigure 3.

The radial velocity\nstandard star HD 58923 (RV=+17.8 km s\u22121 , Wilson 1953)\nwas also observed, to be used as a template for the crosscorrelation measure of the radial velocities of CM Leo and\nto set the radial velocity zero point.\nGiven the relative faintness of our target (< V >=\n13.66 and Vmin \u223c 13.9 mag) and the severe constraints on\nthe exposure length, which we limited to 20-30 min in order\nto avoid phase blurring on the pulsation cycle, we used a\n1010 \u03bcm slit (which projects to 2 arcsec on the sky) and\na 2\u00d72 binning in order to increase the S/N ratio. We obtained 12 high-resolution spectra of the star, covering a full\npulsation cycle. The spectra have resolution R=30,000 and\nmoderate S/N ratio (S/N\u223c 50 for a single spectrum). The\nFWHM measured from the ThAr comparison lamp lines is\n\u223c 0.2 \u00c5 (at \u03bb \u223c 6300 \u00c5).\nData were reduced using standard IRAF processing\ntools to subtract the bias level, trim images, identify and correct \"bad\" pixels by means of long exposure dark frames and\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nflat fields, and divide by a scaled flat field image (comprised\nof 20 spectra taken with a quartz lamp through a blue-pass\nfilter).

Cosmic ray excision was performed using\nlineclean.\nThe individual orders were extracted from the twodimensional data to obtain one-dimensional summed spectra\nof the stellar and comparison lamp frames. The dispersion\nrelation to transform from pixel to wavelength was determined from the ThAr exposures, and applied to all stellar\nspectra, interpolating in time over shifts in the comparison\nline positions on the chip through the course of a night. We\nverified that the resulting wavelength solutions gave correct\npositions of known atmospheric emission and absorption features on each spectrum.

We used the Lomb periodogram\n(Lomb 1976, Scargle 1982) on a wide period interval to derive a first guess of the periodicity, then a truncated Fourier\nseries algorithm (Barning 1963) to refine the period definition and find the best fit model. The period search employed\neach of the complete B, V, and I data-sets. Figure 6 shows\nthe periodograms of CM Leo V, B, and I differential magnitudes with respect to star C3, obtained using the Lomb algorithm to identify the most probable frequency of the data\non a wide period interval of 0.23-0.80 day. A well defined\npeak is present in the plots at \u03c9=2.76 (P\u223c0.d 362), with two\nlower peaks at \u03c9=1.76 and \u03c9=3.76 respectively, which are\naliases of the actual periodicity.\nWe then reduced the interval around the most likely\nperiodicity using the Fourier algorithm to find the best\nfit. The period obtained using a twelve harmonics bestfitting Fourier series on the V data, a 6 harmonics series\non the B data, and a 5 harmonics series on the I data is\nP=0.d 361699\u00b10.000001 and the epoch of maximum light is\nE=2450841.362285. Calibrated light curves for CM Leo in\nB, V, and I, based on the full photometric data-set, and\nphased according to these ephemerides, are shown in Figure 7.\nThe r.m.s. deviation from the best-fitting model is\n\u00b10.023 mag in V , \u00b10.032 mag in B and \u00b10.021 mag in\nI. These residuals are well accounted for by random photometric uncertainties alone (about \u00b10.02 mag in all three\nphotometric passbands, see Section 2.1.1). The derived period agrees fairly well with that published in the GCVS4\n(P=0.d 361732). The amplitude of the light variation is 0.498\nmag in V , 0.631 in B, and 0.301 in I. On the basis of these\namplitudes and the shape of the light curve, CM Leo is classified as a very regular first overtone RR Lyrae star. We\nthus confirm Paper I classification of CM Leo as a c-type\nRR Lyrae, at variance with the GCVS4 original classifica-\n\nFigure 6.

However,\ncomparisons performed in Paper II show that the temperatures derived in this way are within 100 K from the photometric ones. Since the present approach allows a direct comparison with previous results on the same scale of Clementini et al (1995a) and by-passes problems arising from the\ndetermination of the continuum region near e.g. H\u03b2 (see Paper II), we prefer to adopt the photometric temperature, as\ngiven above.\nWe first measured equivalent widths (EWs) for a number of clean lines on the coadded spectrum, using special\npurpose routines (Gratton 1988). Final EWs were measured\nadopting a relation between EW and FWHM from clean\nlines and a Gaussian fitting routine with only one free parameter, as fully explained in Bragaglia et al (2001b).\nlarger for the B \u2212 V and V \u2212 I colours while almost negligible\nfor the V \u2212 K colour-temperature calibration which is also less\nmetallicity dependent (Fernley 1989 and references therein). In\norder to correct for this effect following Clementini et al. (1995a)\nprocedure (see their par. 3.4.2) the mean temperature derived\nfrom individual (B\u2212V )0 's was lowered by 49 K, and that from the\n(V \u2212 I)0 's was lowered by 97 K, before averaging them together,\nto tie them to the (V \u2212 K)-temperature calibration for RR Lyrae\nstars.\n\nTable 6 gives the linelist, the assumed log gf 's and the\nmeasured EWs.\nStandard spectroscopic abundance constraints (abundance results from Fe I lines which show no trends with either expected line strength or excitation or ionization state),\nwere easily satisfied in the analysis, confirming the adopted\nphotometric temperature and surface gravity, and providing the microturbulent velocity. We obtained average abundances of [Fe/H]=\u22121.94 (\u03c3=0.12 dex) from 21 Fe I lines,\nand [Fe/H]=\u22121.92 (\u03c3=0.21 dex) from 10 Fe II lines, using\na stellar atmosphere model with the following parameters:\nTeff = 6582 K, a surface gravity of log g = 3.0, and a microturbulent velocity of Vt = 1.75 km s\u22121 .\nFigure 9 shows the comparison of the spectrum of CM\nLeo, near the Mg b lines, to the spectrum of CU Com, a double mode RR Lyr observed on the same run (Paper II), with\n[Fe/H]=\u22122.38, and whose lines appear, indeed, shallower.\nUncertainties in the derived abundances are mainly due\nto possible errors in the atmospheric parameters (\u00b1 100 K\nin Teff , \u00b1 0.3 dex in log g, \u00b1 0.5 km s\u22121 in Vt , and \u00b10.2\ndex in [A/H]) and on the adopted model atmospheres (Kurucz 1993a,b). Our estimate of the random error contribution (including errors in measuring individual lines) is 0.15\ndex. Thus, our conservative estimate of the metallicity and\nof the total error for CM Leo is [Fe/H]=\u22121.93 \u00b1 0.20. This\nmetallicity is on the same scale of Carretta & Gratton (1997)\nand Clementini et al. (1995a) for RR Lyrae variables.

We point out that large oxygen\noverabundances were found by Clementini et al. (1995a) for\nthree other RR Lyrae stars with [Fe/H]< \u22121 dex.\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n5\n\nTHE MODELING OF THE LIGHT AND\nRADIAL VELOCITY CURVES\n\nWe have compared the observed periodic variations of light\nand radial velocity with the theoretical predictions of models\nbased on the solution of the nonlinear hydrodynamical equations, including a non local and time dependent treatment\nof convective transfer (Bono et al. 1997, Bono, Castellani &\nMarconi 2000, hereinafter BCM). These models not only reproduce the complete topology of the RR Lyrae instability\nstrip but also predict the detailed morphology of light and\nradial velocity curves. As recently shown by BCM in the\ncase of the RRc U Comae, the predictive capability of current models has been tested by reproducing the luminosity\nvariations of the pulsator along a full pulsation cycle. This\napproach, due to the sensitivity of the predicted period and\nlight curve morphology to stellar parameters, supplies tight\nconstraints on stellar mass, effective temperature, intrinsic\nluminosity and, in turn, distance modulus. To this aim we\nhave applied a similar analysis to the observed multiband\nlight curve and radial velocity curve of CM Leo. We built\npulsation models based on the same physical and numerical\nassumptions as in BCM but for the observed metal abundance Z=0.0002 and an assumed helium content Y=0.24.\nThe input mass, luminosity and effective temperature were\nvaried in order to simultaneously reproduce the observed\nperiod (P=0.d 3617), the V band amplitude (AV \u22430.5 mag)\nand light curve morphology. As extensively discussed by\nBono & Stellingwerf (1994), Bono, Caputo, Castellani &\nMarconi (1997), at fixed metallicity the details of predicted\nlight variations along a pulsation cycle mainly depend on\nthe adopted luminosity and effective temperature with a\n\n\f12\n\nDi Fabrizio et al.\n\nmarginal sensitivity to the input stellar mass. In particular\nfor Z in the range 0.0001-0.001 the double maximum, almost\nsinusoidal shape characterizing both CM Leo and U Comae,\nis typical of hot (6800 K \u2264 Tef f \u2264 7100 K) high luminosity (1.7 \u2264 log L/L\u2299 \u2264 1.9) first overtone models. Moreover\nthe amplitude of first overtone models increases with the\nstellar mass, at fixed effective temperature (see also BCM).\nFinally, as simply inferred by Ritter's equation between the\npulsation period P and the mean density \u03c1, combined with\nStephan-Boltzman's law, and more accurately predicted by\nnonlinear convective pulsation models (Bono et al. 1997), the\nperiod is correlated with the luminosity and anticorrelated\nwith both the effective temperature and the stellar mass. All\nthese dependencies significantly restrict the parameter space\nand allow us to single out the model that best reproduces\nthe observed behaviour of CM Leo. Such a best fit model is\noverplotted to the observed V band light curve in Figure 10\n(top right panel).\nThe intrinsic stellar parameters are labeled and the corresponding apparent distance modulus is \u03bcV = 13.20 mag.\nBy assuming E(B \u2212 V )=0.03 mag and AV = 3.1E(B \u2212 V )\n(Schlegel et al. 1998), we obtain a true distance modulus\n\u03bc0 = 13.11 mag. The same model also reproduces the B\n(top left panel) and I (bottom left panel) light curves for\nthe same \u03bc0 , at least within the photometric uncertainties\n(\u223c 0.03). The agreement in different bands testifies that the\ncolours of the best fit model well reproduce the intrinsic\ncolours of CM Leo. The bottom right panel of Figure 10\nshows the comparison between the observed and predicted\nradial velocity curves when a baricenter velocity of 24.47\nKm/s velocity and a projection factor3 of 1.36 are adopted.\nThe agreement is remarkable within the uncertainties on individual data points. As discussed by BCM, the morphology\nof radial velocity curves is more sensitive than the light variations to the details of the coupling between dynamical and\nconvective motions within a pulsating star. Therefore the\nagreement found in Figure 10 confirms the high predictive\ncapability of current pulsation theory.\n\n6\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nCM Leo is a very regular first overtone RR Lyrae (RRc) with\nperiod P=0.d 361699, epoch E=2450841.d 362285, a prominent hump on the raising branch of its light curves, and\nmetal abundance [Fe/H]=\u22121.93 \u00b10.20. Final results as well\nas the average quantities derived for the star from our photometric, pulsational and spectroscopic analyses are summarized in Table 8.\nWe have shown that the irregularities found by Clementini et al. (1995b) in the light curve of CM Leo disappear\nwhen star C3 is used as comparison star, since they were in\nfact produced by variations of about 0.1 mag in the light of\nthe reference star used in Paper I (star C1). The true distance modulus \u03bc0 = 13.11\u00b1 0.02 mag we derive for CM Leo\n\nTable 8.

We recall\nthat a similar result was found also for CU Com (see Paper\nII).\nRR Lyrae stars are known to be powerful standard candles through their absolute magnitude that is only slightly\ndependent on metal abundance. A pulsational estimate of\nthe absolute magnitude of an RR Lyrae star provides an\nindependent calibration of these standard candles and can\nthus be used to infer the distance of any other stellar system\nwhere RR Lyrae's are found, the Large Magellanic Cloud in\nparticular. The absolute magnitude we derive for CM Leo\nfrom the modeling of the multicolour light and radial velocity curves is MV =0.47\u00b10.04 mag, where the error includes\nthe random uncertainty contributions of the photometry\n(0.03 mag), and of the fitting with the theoretical pulsational models (0.02 mag in distance modulus and 0.01 mag\nin log L, respectively).\nAllowing for an evolution of about 0.08 mag off the Zero\nAge Horizontal Branch for the RR Lyrae stars, as suggested\nby Caputo & Degl'Innocenti (1995), and Caloi, D'Antona\n& Mazzitelli (1997), and a slope of 0.2 mag/dex for the\nluminosity-metallicity relation of RR Lyrae's to correct CM\nLeo absolute magnitude to the average metal abundance of\nthe RR Lyrae in the Large Magellanic Cloud ([Fe/H]=\u22121.50:\nAlcock et al. 1996, Bragaglia et al. 2001a), the absolute magnitude we derive for CM Leo implies a value for the true\ndistance modulus of the LMC of \u03bc0 (LMC) = 18.43\u00b10.06\nmag, for an average dereddened luminosity of the RR Lyrae\nin the LMC bar < V0 (RR) >=19.07\u00b10.05 (Clementini et\nal. 2001), in better agreement with the long astronomical\ndistance scale.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis paper is based on observations obtained with the\n\n3\n\nThe projection factor is the conversion term from radial to\neffective pulsation velocity, taking into account the geometrical\nprojection of stellar velocity fields corrected for limb darkening\neffects.\n\n4 The distance from the galactic plane almost coincides with the\ndistance from the Sun since CM Leo is located in the direction of\nthe Galactic pole.\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fCM Leo\n\n13\n\nFigure 10.
