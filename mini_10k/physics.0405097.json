A distinct characteristic of PLC effect is the up-load\nand down-load behavior of the total stress vs time curves, due to the pinning / unpinning\nof lattice dislocations [1]. As a result, the stress time series is comprised of successive\nstick-slip patterns, i.e. slow rather linear up-trends followed by fast down-trends. Simple\nphysically-based mathematical models, suggested in the literature, reproduce partially this\nfeature [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Recently, data analysis using nonlinear methods give evidence for\nnonlinear and chaotic behavior [7, 8, 9].\nNonlinear methods, mostly based on chaos theory, have been applied to real data from\ndifferent fields with varying success [10, 11]. These methods provide estimates of dynamical characteristics of the underlying system, such as topological or fractal dimenion,\nentropy and Lyapunov exponent, as well as sophisticated data driven models. However, the\nestimates are meaningful if there is evidence that the underlying system is indeed nonlinear deterministic and eventually chaotic. Regarding the nonlinearity in the data, an indirect\napproach, namely testing the null hypothesis that the data are linear stochastic, has gained\nmuch interest in the last years. The test employs surrogate data to form the empirical distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis [12, 13, 14].\n\n2\n\n\fThe methodology of nonlinear dynamics, including the surrogate data test for nonlinearity has been applied recently to data from the PLC effect. In a number of experiments\nof occurrence of the PLC effect, nonlinear techniques were used aiming at characterising\nthe structure of the stress times series. Within certain experimental range, jerky flow was\nreported to exhibit chaotic behaviour for single crystals of Cu-Al alloys [8, 5] as well as\nfor Al-Mg polycrystals [9, 7]. Moreover, for both crystals, the surrogate data test gave evidence for the existence of nonlinear dynamics. However, one could argue that this evidence\nis solely due to the presence of strong deterministic structure at small time scales within the\nupload or download phase, a quite obvious form of nonlinear dynamics.\nIn this work, we direct the statistical analysis to a different time scale. We focus on correlations at a larger time scale that spans over the stick-slips, that is we investigate whether\nthere is long term deterministic structure in addition to the short term nonlinear dynamics\nthat forms the stick-slip patterns. The data analysis is done by means of hypothesis testing,\nwhere the null hypothesis is that the stick\u2013slip sequence is random. For this we introduce\nan algorithm generating surrogate data with the same stick-slip patterns at a random order\nand we apply several linear and nonlinear statistics. We use three stress time series from\nsingle crystals at different experimental conditions.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, the stress data are described and in\nSection 3, the results of the standard nonlinear analysis on these are reviewed. In Section 4,\nthe surrogate test for the hypothesis of random stick\u2013slips is described, and in Section 5, the\nresults of the application of the test to the stress data are presented. Finally, a discussion\nfollows in Section 6.\n\n3\n\n\f2 The Stress Data\nThe stress time series are recordings of the total stress of single crystal Cu-10% Al under\ncompression at a constant strain rate (these time series were used in [15]). The notation\nand some specifications for the data sets are given in Table 1. The selected records from the\nexperiments regard plastic deformation giving successive slow up-load and rapid down-load\nof stress. Table 1 to be placed here\n\n3 Review of the Nonlinear Analysis of the Stress Data\nRecently, it has been shown that the stress time series at low and medium strain rates are\nnonlinear and chaotic using standard nonlinear methods based on chaos theory [8, 5]. We\nstart by reviewing these results on a particular time series, S1, described in Section 2.\nThe stress time series and a segment of this is shown in Fig. 1 (top pannel). The structure\nof successive stick\u2013slip patterns for this stress range clearly indicates that the underlying\nsystem is deterministic at small time scales. The other stress time series listed in Table 1\nshow the same feature of stick-slips. There is no ambiguity at the level of sampling time\nas to the evolution of the up-load stress (stick phase); it is simply a linear upward trend.\nThe same holds for the slip phase, which is much shorter and thus the slope of the downward trend is very large. This fine piecewise linear stress evolution cannot be generated by\nconventional stochastic Markov chain models, such as ARMA models, neither by a linear\ndeterministic system. It is therefore of no surprise that the estimates from nonlinear methods applied to this type of time series suggest nonlinear deterministic structure (for a review\non nonlinear methods refer to [16, 10, 11]).\n\n4\n\n\fThe presence of nonlinear short-term dynamics can also be established statistically, testing the null hypothesis H0 that the stress time series is generated by a linear (Gaussian)\nprocess, perturbed by a static, possibly nonlinear, transform [12, 13, 14]. The transform\nis included in H0 to explain deviations from Gaussian amplitude distribution of the data,\nwhich is often observed in real time series. The test involves the generation of an ensemble\nof surrogate data, i.e. time series that represent the null hypothesis, and the computation of a\ntest statistic q, here an estimate from a nonlinear method, on the original and surrogate data.\nIf the estimate q0 on the original data does not lie within the empirical distribution of q under H0 , formed by the estimates q1 , q2 , . . . , qM on the M surrogates, then H0 is rejected and\nit is unlikely that the original time series is linear stochastic. The statistics q1 , q2 , . . . , qM\nform typically a normal-like distribution. Therefore the deviation of the statistic q0 on the\noriginal data from the distribution of q under H0 is quantified by the significance S defined\nas\nS=\n\n|q0 \u2212 q\u0304|\n,\nsq\n\n(1)\n\nwhere q\u0304 and sq are the average and standard deviation of q1 , q2 , . . . , qM , respectively. The\nrejection region for H0 is formed by a lower limit for S given from the critical value of\nstandard normal distribution at a prespecified confidence level. If S > 1.96, H0 is rejected\nat the 95% confidence level.\nOne could easily discriminate the surrogate data (consistent to the abovementioned H0 )\nfrom the original stress data solely by eyeball judgement. As shown in Fig. 1 (middle panel),\nthe surrogate time series fails to capture the special feature of the original data. The surrogate time series used in this Section are generated using the STAP algorithm, recently\npresented in [17]. The same results were obtained using the AAFT and IAAFT algorithms\n\n5\n\n\f(for a review on the algorithms and their performance see [18]). The surrogate data are\ndesigned to mimic the original time series in terms of amplitude distribution and autocorrelation and are otherwise random. These two conditions are apparently not sufficient to\npreserve the stick\u2013slip patterns of the stress data.\nIn Fig. 2, we show estimates of the autocorrelation, mutual information and largest Lyapunov exponent on the original stress data and 40 STAP surrogate time series (for review\non these methods see [16, 10, 11])1 .\nThe results on autocorrelation r(\u03c4 ) for \u03c4 = 1, . . . , 50\u03c4s , confirm that the STAP surrogate data have the same linear structure as the original time series The other two measures are both nonlinear. The mutual information I(\u03c4 ) measures the general correlation,\nlinear and nonlinear. The discrepancy in I(\u03c4 ) for the original and the surrogate data,\nshown in Fig. 2b, suggests that the original data contain nonlinear correlations and therefore give larger mutual information for a long range of lags. The largest Lyapunov exponent \u03bb1 (m) measures the rate of divergence in the evolution of nearby trajectories in a\nreconstructed state space of dimension m. Chaotic and stochastic systems have positive \u03bb1 ,\nand large positive \u03bb1 indicate high complexity or stochasticity. As shown in Fig. 2c, the\noriginal data obtain significantly larger \u03bb1 (m) for the whole range of embedding dimensions m = 1, . . . , 10, which indicates that they exhibit more complexity than the surrogate\ndata. For both nonlinear statistics the significance S takes very high values giving rejection\nof H0 at essentially 100% confidence level. The same results were established with other\ngeneration algorithms for the surrogate data and other nonlinear estimates, i.e. correlation\ndimension and fitting error of local averages.\n1\n\nThe algorithms in the TISEAN software were used, see [19].\n\n6\n\n\fThe nonlinear time series analysis we have done so far could reproduce a quite evident\nresult, i.e. the stress time series contains nonlinear dynamics at small time scale. A more\ninteresting question we investigate next is whether there is any evidence of determinism or\ncorrelation in the evolution of the stick\u2013slip patterns of the stress time series.\n\n4 Surrogate Data Test for Sequence of Patterns\nWe employ the statistical approach of surrogate data testing discussed in Section 3, but the\nworking H0 now is that the succession of the stick\u2013slip patterns is random, i.e. the stick\u2013\nslip states are independent. The surrogate data for this H0 should have the same stick\u2013slip\nstructure as the stress data, but at a random order.\n\n4.1 The SUDT algorithm\nWe have built an algorithm, called Stochastic Up-Down Trends (SUDT), to generate the\nsurrogate data for this H0 . The algorithm permutates randomly the stick\u2013slips of the original\ntime series taking care that the range of the original data is retained. Specifically, the steps\nof the algorithm are as follows:\n1. Scan the original time series x = [x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ]\u2032 , identify and store the up-down\ntrend patterns, as well as the global minimum xmin , the global maximum xmax , the\nsmallest end-point of the up-trend xu and the largest end point of the down-trend xd .\n2. The surrogate time series z to be constructed starts at the same data point as x, i.e.\nz1 = x1 (a random point could be chosen as well).\n3. Using discrete uniform distribution, draw randomly an up-down trend segment from\n\n7\n\n\fthose stored in step 1, and displace it so that its starting point coincides with the\ncurrently last point of the time series z (for the first iteration this is z1 ).\n4. Check whether the \"up\" end-point of the chosen up-down trend segment is between\nxu and xmax , and the \"down\" end-point is between xmin and xd . If the two end-points\nare within the given limits, then accept the up-down trend (the \"down\" end-point of\nthe accepted trend is now the last data point of the time series). If not, then discard\nthe up-down trend and repeat step 3.\n5. Repeat the last two steps until the time series z is as long as the original time series\n(eventually truncating the last eligible trend).\nNote that the algorithm assumes that the original time series starts with an upward trend.\nWe adjust accordingly the data sets by dropping a few samples from the beginning if necessary. Alternatively, one can simply reverse the magnitudes of the original data (e.g. multiply\nby -1) before applying the algorithm.\nThis algorithm implements bootstrapping on blocks of data, i.e. the up-down trends\nfrom the original time series, allowing repetitions of the same block of data in the surrogate\ntime series. Simple shuffling of the original trends cannot be done because the end-points\nhave to match.\nIt was found necessary to constrain the random selection of the up-down trends using\nlower and upper limits for both the \"up\" and \"down\" end-points of each trend in order to\nkeep the generated surrogate time series z within the bounds of the original data. The use\nof the global minimum and maximum (xmin and xmax ) alone led to edge effect problems,\nso the additional limits of xu and xd had to be introduced to assure robust execution of the\n\n8\n\n\falgorithm. This increases the frequency of discarding randomly selected up-down trends\nand mars the random order of the up-down trends.\n\n4.2 Examples with simulated data\nThe surrogate data generated by the SUDT algorithm represent the H0 of independent stick\u2013\nslip states in the time series. Certainly, the stick\u2013slip states of the original data may be\ncorrelated implying that the underlying mechanism exhibits a deterministic structure on\nlonger time scales, which is an interesting possible aspect for the PLC effect.\nUsing simulated data, we show that the standard methods of time series analysis have actually discriminative power and can distinguish the original time series from its SUDT surrogates only when this is the case. For this, we use deterministic and stochastic time series\nof the stick-slip type. For the deterministic case, we use 2000 data of the log\u2013transformed\nw variable of the R\u00f6ssler hyperchaos system [20], sampled at time \u03c4s = 0.1sec, call it xd .\nThis time series exhibits stick\u2013slip structure. For the stochastic case (time series with random stick\u2013slip states), we simply use a time series derived by the SUDT algorithm on xd ,\ncall it xs . Two segments of the two time series are shown in Fig. 3a. Note that the time\nseries xd and xs have the same structure and cannot be distinguished by eyeball judgement.\nIn the generation of 40 SUDT surrogates, there were on average 48 rejections of candidate\nstick-slips for xd (which is comprised of 193 stick\u2013slip patterns) and about the same for xs ,\nso that the shuffling can indeed be considered random. The SUDT surrogate data for each\nof the two time series possess similar amplitude distribution to the original ones, as shown\nin Fig. 3b. The same holds for the distribution of the up and down velocities and for the\ndistribution of the up and down times. The preservation of all these distributions signifies\n\n9\n\n\fthe successful performance of the SUDT algorithm.\nWe apply the linear and nonlinear test statistics on xd , xs and their respective SUDT surrogates. The results are shown in Fig. 4. The autocorrelation r(\u03c4 ) does not discriminate xs\nfrom its SUDT surrogates, as expected, but the same holds for xd (see Fig. 4a). Specifically\nfor xd , rejection of H0 at the 95% confidence level could only be established for a small\nrange of delays around \u03c4 = 5, as shown in Fig. 4d. So, for the chaotic time series from\nR\u00f6ssler hyperchaos the linear test statistic has essentially no discriminative power. Note\nthat there is no reason to believe that this is always the case with deterministic systems.\nHowever, the same results were obtained also on a quasi-periodic system with stick\u2013slip\nstructure (a two torus, for description of the system see [21]).\nThe chaotic deterministic data xd are correctly distinguished from their respective SUDT\nsurrogates with both nonlinear statistics, i.e. the mutual information I(\u03c4 ) and the largest\nLyapunov exponent \u03bb1 (m), as shown in Fig. 4b and c. Subsequently, the H0 of independent stick\u2013slip states is rejected at the 95% confidence levels for a long range of the free\nparameter of its statistic (see Fig. 4e and f). On the other hand, the xs data are correctly\nnot distinguished from their respective SUDT surrogates by either \u03bb1 (m) or I(\u03c4 ), and H0\nis not rejected for any value of the free parameter of the two statistics. Very similar results\nwere obtained on the quasi-periodic system (where S obtained larger values for the deterministic system) as well as when using other nonlinear statistics, e.g. local average maps\nand entropy.\nThese findings show that even standard nonlinear statistics that are not tailored for\nthis particular test can distinguish correctly correlated stick\u2013slip states from non-correlated\nstick\u2013slip states of similar shape.\n\n10\n\n\f5 Application of the Test to the Stress Data\nIn order to avoid false local minima and maxima the stress time series were smoothed using\na finite impulse response filter prior to the identification of the stick\u2013slips. Note that there\nwas no further use of the smoothed time series and the shuffling in the SUDT algorithm\nwas done on the original stick\u2013slips. The SUDT surrogate time series preserve well the\nstick\u2013slip patterns of all the PLC stress time series. In Fig. 1, this is shown for the stress\ntime series S1 and one SUDT surrogate of this (upper and lower pannel, respectively).\nFor the surrogate data to be proper for the test, we require good match of the distribution of the data, the distribution of the velocity of the up and down trends, as well as the\ndistribution of the time of the up and down trends. The velocity and time distributions were\npreserved in the SUDT surrogates for all three stress time series. The amplitude distribution was well preserved for S2, sufficiently preserved for S1 and not preserved for S3, as\nshown in Fig. 5. It turns out that the stick\u2013slip time series generated by the SUDT algorithm tend to possess symmetric amplitude distribution, so that when the original data have\nskewed distribution (as is the case with S3) deviations in amplitude distribution do occur\n(see Fig. 5c). This constitutes a shortcoming of the SUDT algorithm to provide proper\nstick\u2013slip surrogates. So, whenever the amplitude distribution is not preserved one may\nquestion the outcome of the test as deviations in the test statistics that may lead to rejection\nof H0 may be assigned to the mismatch of amplitude distribution.\nIn Fig. 6, the outcome of the test using the three test statistics is shown. The linear\nstatistic r(\u03c4 ) distinguishes the time series S1 from its 40 surrogates (for a long range of \u03c4 ),\nbut not S2. For S3, the r(\u03c4 ) for the SUDT surrogates is much higher (accordingly, S takes\nvery high values not shown in Fig. 6d for \u03c4 \u2264 13), but this mismatch may be due to the\n11\n\n\flack of match in amplitude distribution, so it cannot be regarded as genuine discrimination\nthat would correspond to rejection of H0 . Therefore, the clear rejection for S3 also with the\nnonlinear statistics are not reliable.\nIt should be noted that for S1, the original r(\u03c4 ) for \u03c4 < 40 is actually smaller in amplitude than for the surrogates suggesting the opposite of the alternative hypothesis we attempt\nto establish, i.e. the surrogate data involve more correlations than the original data. A possible explanation for this would be the discrepancy at the bulk of the amplitude distribution\nbetween S1 and its surrogates (see Fig. 5a). We note also that sucl long range correlations\nare often due to drift in the data.\nThe I(\u03c4 ) statistic that measures both linear and nonlinear correlations is at the same\nlevel for S1 and its SUDT surrogates, as shown in Fig. 6b. Compared to the results with\nr(\u03c4 ), it seems that S1 contains nonlinear correlations not present in the SUDT surrogates.\nHowever, S is below the threshold for rejection of H0 at the 95% confidence level for all\nbut very small \u03c4 (see Fig. 6e). The \u03bb1 (m) statistic shows also a difference in nonlinear\ncorrelations between S1 and its surrogates giving confident rejections at the 95% level for\nm > 2, as shown in Fig. 6c and f.\nThe stress time series S2 could not be discriminated from its SUDT surrogates with any\nof the three statistics, indicating that it has no correlations between stick\u2013slips.\nThe results on the three stress time series suggest that there is not enough statistical evidence to establish that the stick\u2013slip states of the stress time series from plastic deformation\nof single crystals are correlated and thus that there is a deterministic system at large time\nscales that controls the evolution of the stick\u2013slip states.\n\n12\n\n\f6 Discussion\nIt is plausible that the evolution of the stress in the PLC effect is rather deterministic at short\ntime scales as the stress time series has a characteristic stick-slip structure. We employed\nstatistical testing to investigate whether there is a deterministic mechanism that controls the\nstress at larger time scales that span over the duration of the stick-slip states. The standard\nsurrogate data test for nonlinearity, used recently to establish determinism and nonlinearity\nfor the PLC effect, is not suitable for the question of interest as the surrogate data do not preserve the stick-slip structure. Subsequently, the disrcimination between original stress time\nseries and surrogate data (generated under the null hypothesis of linear stochastic system)\nis guaranteed. However, this result does not establish the presence of correlations between\nthe stick\u2013slips that should be present if the underlying mechanism is nonlinear deterministic. Indeed, our simulations showed that time series comprised of uncorrelated stick\u2013slips\nare also discriminated from this type of surrogates, questioning the appropriateness of the\nsurrogate data test for nonlinearity for this type of time series.\nWe designed the SUDT algorithm to generate surrogate data of stick\u2013slip structure and\nperformed the surrogate data test for the null hypothesis of independent stick-slip states.\nNonlinear statistics as the ones used for the test for nonlinearity turned out to perform appropriately when applied to simulated data. However, the power of the statistics on chaotic\ntime series with stick-slip structure was not as high as for the quasi-periodic systems.\nWe applied this test on three stress time series from plastic deformation of single crystal\nCu-10% Al under compression at different strain rates. We used one linear test statistic,\ni.e. the autocorrelation, and two nonlinear statistics: the mutual information and the largest\nLyapunov exponent. The null hypothesis could be rejected, but not clearly, for the stress\n13\n\n\ftime series obtained at low constant strain rate (\u01eb\u0307 = 3.3 * 10\u22126 s\u22121 ) and could not be rejected\nwith any test statistic for the stress time series obtained at medium constant strain rate (\u01eb\u0307 =\n37 * 10\u22126 s\u22121 ). For the third time series at larger constant strain rate (\u01eb\u0307 = 107 * 10\u22126 s\u22121 ), the\nSUDT algorithm failed to match the amplitude distribution and thus the rejection obtained\nwith the test statistics is questioned. Overall, the statistical testing could not establish that\nthe stress time series contain significant correlations. However, this is a pilot study and a\nsystematic application of the test to stress time series under varying experimental conditions\nis planned.\nAn improvement of the SUDT algorithm would be to constraint the surrogates to match\nthe amplitude distribution of the original time series, but there does not seem to be an\nobvious way to do this. Our simulations showed that the match is maintained through the\nsuffling of the stick\u2013slips, but for one stress time series this failed. Also, the test may\nbe improved by employing other test statistics that are tailored to capture the information\nrelating the stick-slip states, such as correlation between the lengths of successive up-down\ntrends or between the magnitudes of successive turning points.\n\nAcknowledgements\nPartial support of the European Community's Human Potential Programme under contract HPRN-CT-2002-00198 (DEFINO) and research interaction between AUTh/Greece\nand TUB/Germany are acknowledged.\n\n14\n\n\fReferences\n[1] Bell.
