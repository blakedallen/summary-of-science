We investigate the relationship between the metric boundary and\nthe Gromov boundary of a hyperbolic metric space. We show that the Gromov boundary is a quotient topological space of the metric boundary, and\nthat therefore a word-hyperbolic group has an amenable action on the metric\nboundary of its Cayley graph. This result has significance for the study of\nLip-norms on group C*-algebras.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe Gromov boundary of a hyperbolic metric space has been extensively studied,\nbut the Gromov boundary is not guaranteed to exist for non-hyperbolic metric\nspaces. Gromov [4] introduced another boundary which makes sense for any metric\nspace, but this was little studied until Rieffel [8] showed that this second boundary,\ncalled the metric boundary in his papers, is important in the study of metrics on\nthe state spaces of group C*-algebras.\nIf G is a countable discrete group equipped with a length function l, and Cr\u2217 (G)\nis its reduced C*-algebra, then one has a seminorm Ll (f ) = k[Ml , f ]k defined on\na dense *-subalgebra of Cr\u2217 (G), where Ml is multiplication by l and f operates by\nconvolution on l2 (G). This in turn gives a metric on the state space of Cr\u2217 (G) by\n\u03c1Ll (\u03c6, \u03c8) = sup{|\u03c6(f ) \u2212 \u03c8(f )| : Ll (f ) \u2264 1},\nand a natural question to ask is whether the topology generated by this metric\ncoincides with the weak-* topology on the state space, ie. the seminorm is a Lipnorm [6, 7, 9]. Rieffel proves that this is in fact the case for Zd with certain length\nfunctions, and a critical requirement in his proof is that the action of Zd on its\nmetric boundary is always amenable.\nThere is some interest, then, in knowing when the action of a group is amenable\non its metric boundary. In the case of word-hyperbolic groups with the standard\nword-length metric, it is known that the action of a word-hyperbolic group on its\nGromov boundary is amenable [2, 3], and as Rieffel points out in [8], if there is\nan equivariant, continuous surjection from the metric boundary onto the Gromov\nboundary, then the action of the group on the metric boundary must be amenable.\nWe show that this is in fact the case, and more: the Gromov boundary is a\nquotient topological space of the metric boundary in a completely natural way, and\nthat the quotient map is therefore such an equivariant, continuous surjection from\nthe metric boundary to the Gromov boundary.\nDate: September 18, 2003.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

However these methods do not work for Zd , and we hope that our result\nmay lead to a unified way of showing that the seminorms for these groups are in\nfact Lip-norms.\nThis paper is part of an undergraduate research project between the authors.\nThe authors would like to thank Michelle Schultz for organizing the undergraduate\nresearch seminar at UNLV, and Marc Rieffel for encouraging this line of research.\n2. The Gromov Boundary\nThere are many different but equivalent definitions for a hyperbolic metric space,\nbut for our purposes we are only interested in a couple. We follow Alonso, Smith,\net. al. [1], in our presentation, and a more complete discussion of hyperbolic spaces\ncan be found there.\nDefinition 2.1. A metric space (X, d) is geodesic if given any two points x, y \u2208 X,\nthere is an isometry \u03b3 from the interval [0, d(x, y)] into X.\nIf (X, d) is a metric space, with a base-point 0, we define an inner product by\n1\n(d(x, 0) + d(y, 0) \u2212 d(x, y)).\n2\nWhere the base point is implicit, we will just write (x * y).\nThe metric space (X, d) is hyperbolic if it is geodesic and there is some \u03b4 \u2265 0\nsuch that\n(x * y)0 =\n\n(1)\n\n(x * y) \u2265 min{(x * z), (y * z)} \u2212 \u03b4\n\nfor all z \u2208 X.\nOne can show that although the constant \u03b4 may be different for different basepoints, whether or not the space is hyperbolic does not depend on the choice of\nbase-point.\nWe have a particular interest in groups whose Cayley graphs are hyperbolic, and\nthere is an equivalent definition based on properties of generators and relations\nalone. We note that if G is a group with a finite presentation hS|Ri, then given a\nreduced word w in the generators, S, with w = e in G, we can write w as a product\nw=\n\nn\nY\n\nu\u22121\nk rk uk ,\n\nk=1\n\u22121\n\nwhere uk is a word in S \u222a S , and rk \u2208 R \u222a R\u22121 . For a given w, let nw be the\nsmallest possible number of terms in such a product, and let l(w) be the length of\nw.\nDefinition 2.2. Let G be a group with a finite presentation hS|Ri. We say that\nG is word-hyperbolic if it satisfies a linear isoperimetric inequality: there is some\nK \u2265 0 such that\nnw \u2264 Kl(w),\nfor all reduced words w with w = e in G.\nOne can show that the choice of generators and relations does not affect whether\nor not the group is word-hyperbolic and, moreover, a group is word-hyperbolic if\n\n\fBOUNDARIES OF HYPERBOLIC METRIC SPACES\n\n3\n\nand only if its Cayley graph (regarded as a 1-complex with the graph metric) is\nhyperbolic.\nPerhaps the simplest way to consider the Gromov boundary is as the limit points\nof geodesic rays, where two geodesic rays are considered equivalent if they are a\nfinite distance apart. This definition highlights similarities between the Gromov\nboundary and the metric boundary discussed in the next section. However, the\nmost useful definition of the Gromov boundary for our purposes is in terms of the\ninner product.\nDefinition 2.3. Let (X, d) be a metric space. We say that a sequence xk converges\nto infinity (in the Gromov sense) if\nlim (xn * xk ) = \u221e.\n\nn,k\u2192\u221e\n\n\u221e\nGiven two sequences x = (xn )\u221e\nn=1 and y = (yn )n=1 which both converge to infinity,\nwe define a relation \u223c by\n\nx \u223c y \u21d0\u21d2 lim (xn * yn ) = \u221e.\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nIf (X, d) is a hyperbolic metric space, then \u223c is in fact an equivalence relation\non sequences which converge to infinity. It is worthwhile noting that if (X, d) is\nhyperbolic then\nx \u223c y \u21d0\u21d2 lim (xn * yk ) = \u221e.\nn,k\u2192\u221e\n\nIf (X, d) is not hyperbolic, the relation \u223c will not be an equivalence relation, in\ngeneral:\nExample 2.1. Consider the Cayley graph of Z2 with the standard generators and\nrelations. Let xn = (n, 0), yn = (0, n) and zn = (n, n). All three sequences converge\nto infinity, but although x \u223c z and y \u223c z, x 6\u223c y.\nWe define the Gromov boundary \u2202G X of a hyperbolic metric space (X, d) to be\nthe set of equivalence classes of sequences which converge to infinity. We will say\nthat a sequence in X converges to an equivalence class in \u2202G X if it is an element\nof the equivalence class.\nG\nWe can topologise the boundary by extending the inner product to X = X \u222a\n\u2202G X.\nG\n\nDefinition 2.4. Let (X, d) be a hyperbolic metric space, and let x, y \u2208 X . Then\nwe define\n(x * y) = inf{lim inf (xn * yn ) : xn \u2192 x, yn \u2192 y, and xn , yn \u2208 X}.\nn\n\nOne can show that if this inner product is restricted to X, it is the same as the\noriginal inner product on X. Indeed, if \u03c9 \u2208 \u2202G X, and y \u2208 X, we have\n(\u03c9 * y) = inf{lim inf (xn * y) : xn \u2192 \u03c9, and xn \u2208 X}.\nn\n\nIt is also the case that if (X, d) is hyperbolic, with\n(x * y) \u2265 min{(x * z), (y * z)} \u2212 \u03b4\nfor all x, y and z \u2208 X, then the same identity holds for this extended inner product.\nWe have\n(x * y) \u2265 min{(x * z), (y * z)} \u2212 \u03b4,\n\n\f4\n\nCORRAN WEBSTER AND ADAM WINCHESTER\nG\n\nfor all x, y and z \u2208 X .\nG\nWe then can say that a sequence xn \u2208 X converges to \u03c9 \u2208 \u2202G X if and only if\n(\u03c9 * xn ) \u2192 \u221e.\nWith this definition, it can be shown that X\n\nG\n\nis a compactification of X.\n\n3. The Metric Boundary\nWe now consider the metric compactification and the metric boundary. The\nd\nmost succinct definition is that the metric compactification X of a metric space\n(X, d) corresponds to the pure states of the commutative, unital, C*-algebra G(X, d)\ngenerated by the functions which vanish at infinity on X, the constant functions,\nand the functions of the form\n\u03c6y (x) = d(x, 0) \u2212 d(x, y),\nwhere 0 is some fixed base-point (which does not affect the resulting algebra). The\nd\nmetric boundary \u2202d X is simply X \\ X.\nMore concretely, we can understand the metric boundary as a limit of rays in\nmuch the same way as the simple definition of the Gromov boundary.\nDefinition 3.1. Let (X, d) be a metric space, and T an unbounded subset of R+\ncontaining 0, and let \u03b3 : T \u2192 X. We say that\n(1) \u03b3 is a geodesic ray if\nd(\u03b3(s), \u03b3(t)) = |s \u2212 t|\nfor all s, t \u2208 T .\n(2) \u03b3 is an almost-geodesic ray if for every \u03b5 > 0, there is an integer N such\nthat\n|d(\u03b3(t), \u03b3(s)) + d(\u03b3(s), \u03b3(0)) \u2212 t| < \u03b5\nfor all t, s \u2208 T with t \u2265 s \u2265 N .\n(3) \u03b3 is a weakly-geodesic ray if for every y \u2208 X and every \u03b5 > 0, there is an\ninteger N such that\n|d(\u03b3(t), \u03b3(0)) \u2212 t| < \u03b5\nand\n|d(\u03b3(t), y) \u2212 d(\u03b3(s), y) \u2212 (t \u2212 s)| < \u03b5\nfor all t, s \u2208 T with t, s \u2265 N .\nIt is immediate that every geodesic ray is an almost-geodesic ray. Rieffel showed\nthat every almost-geodesic ray is a weakly-geodesic ray. The significance of weakly\ngeodesic rays is that they give the points on the metric boundary in reasonable\nmetric spaces.\nTheorem 3.1 (Rieffel). Let (X, d) be a complete, locally compact metric space,\nand let \u03b3 : T \u2192 X be a weakly geodesic ray in X. Then\nlim f (\u03b3(t))\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nexists for every f \u2208 G(X, d), and defines an element of \u2202d X. Conversely, if d is\nproper and if (X, d) has a countable base, then every point of \u2202d X is determined as\nabove by a weakly-geodesic ray.\n\n\fBOUNDARIES OF HYPERBOLIC METRIC SPACES\n\n5\n\nThis is similar in character to the definition of the Gromov boundary, although\nthe reliance on weakly-geodesic rays is necessary in general. Rieffel defined any\npoint \u2202d X which is the limit of an almost-geodesic ray to be a Busemann point, and\nit was shown in [10] that even for simple hyperbolic spaces the metric boundary may\nhave non-Busemann points. It is an open question as to whether this phenomenon\ncan occur with word-hyperbolic groups.\nUnlike the Gromov boundary, the metric boundary is, in general, dependent upon\nthe choice of metric. For example, different generating sets for an infinite discrete\ngroup generally give distinct metric boundaries for the corresponding word-length\nmetrics.\nFrom a practical viewpoint, the initial definition of the metric boundary means\nthat a sequence xn \u2208 X converges to a point on the metric boundary iff xn is\neventually outside any compact subset of X, and \u03c6y (xn ) converges for all y \u2208 X.\nTwo sequences converge to the same point on the metric boundary iff\nlim \u03c6z (xn ) = lim \u03c6z (yk )\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nfor every z \u2208 X. We can extend the functions \u03c6y to the boundary by letting\n\u03c6y (\u03c9) = lim \u03c6y (xn )\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nd\n\nfor any sequence xn \u2192 \u03c9 \u2208 \u2202d X. Then a sequence xn \u2208 X converges to x \u2208 \u2202d X\niff \u03c6y (xn ) \u2192 \u03c6y (x) for all y \u2208 X, and this is sufficient to determine the topology\nof the metric compactification.\n4. The Gromov Boundary as a Quotient\nWe observe that the functions \u03c6y and the inner product are closely related, since\n1\n(\u03c6y (x) + d(y, 0)),\n2\nand furthermore, they play similar roles in the definitions of Gromov and metric\nboundaries. It is natural, therefore, to ask what relationship there may be between\nthe two different boundaries.\nThe key observation is that the triangle inequality implies that for any z \u2208 X,\n1\n1\n(x * y) \u2265 (d(x, 0) + d(y, 0) \u2212 d(x, z) \u2212 d(y, z)) = (\u03c6z (x) + \u03c6z (y)),\n2\n2\nwith equality iff z lies on a geodesic path [x, y]. We will want to show that that\n(x * y) gets large for elements from various sequences, and this implies that all we\nneed do is find a z so that \u03c6z (x) + \u03c6z (y) is large.\nThe following lemma tells us that as we get close to a metric boundary point,\nwe can find z such that \u03c6z is large.\n(x * y) =\n\nLemma 4.1. Let (X, d) be a proper geodesic metric space with a distinguished basepoint 0. Then for any \u03c9 in the metric boundary of X, and any N , there is a point\nz \u2208 X such that \u03c6z (\u03c9) > N .\nProof. Let xn be any sequence which converges to \u03c9.\nLet r > 0 and consider a collection of minimal paths [0, xn ] for n large enough\nthat d(0, xn ) > r. Because (X, d) is a geodesic metric space, there must be a unique\npoint yn in each of these paths in the sphere S(0, r) of radius r, centred at 0. Since\n(X, d) is proper the sphere S(0, r) is compact, and so given any \u03b5 > 0 we must be\n\n\f6\n\nCORRAN WEBSTER AND ADAM WINCHESTER\n\nable to find at least one point zr \u2208 S(0, r) such that an infinite number of the yn\nlie within \u03b5/2 of zr . Let xnj be the subsequence of xn corresponding to this infinite\nsubset. Then we have, for r > \u03b5 and j sufficiently large,\nd(0, xnj ) = d(0, ynj ) + d(ynj , xnj ) > d(0, zr ) + d(zr , xnj ) \u2212 \u03b5,\nor, equivalently,\n\u03c6zr (xnj ) = d(0, xnj ) \u2212 d(zr , xnj ) > d(0, zr ) \u2212 \u03b5 = r \u2212 \u03b5.\nTaking limits, we conclude that\n\u03c6zr (\u03c9) \u2265 r \u2212 \u03b5.\nHence, given any N , we can choose r and \u03b5 such that r \u2212 \u03b5 > N , and obtain a\npoint z such that\n\u03c6z (\u03c9) > N.\n\u0003\nThis lemma has two immediate corollaries:\nCorollary 4.2. Let (X, d) be a proper geodesic metric space with a distinguished\nbase-point 0, and let xn \u2192 \u03c9 \u2208 \u2202d X. Then xn converges to infinity in the Gromov\nsense.\nProof. We know that for all z, \u03c6z (xn ) eventually gets close to \u03c6z (\u03c9). Hence by the\nprevious lemma, for any N can find a z such that \u03c6z (xn ) > N for all n sufficiently\nlarge.\nHowever, we than have that if xn and xm are large enough that both \u03c6z (xn )\nand \u03c6z (xn ) are greater than N , then\n1\n(xn * xm ) \u2265 (\u03c6z (xn ) + \u03c6z (xm )) > N\n2\nTherefore\nlim (xn * xm ) = \u221e\nn,m\u2192\u221e\n\nand so xn goes to infinity in the Gromov sense.\n\n\u0003\n\nLet (xn ) and (yk ) be two sequences in X which converge to points on the metric\nboundary. We will say that (xn ) \u223cd (yk ) if these two sequences converge to the\nsame metric boundary point. Similarly, if these sequences converge to points on the\nGromov boundary, we will say that (xn ) \u223cG (yk ). Note that despite the notation\n\u223cG is not necessarily an equivalence relation.\nCorollary 4.3. Let (X, d) be a proper geodesic metric space. Then (xn ) \u223cd (yk )\nimplies (xn ) \u223cG (yk ).\nProof. Let xn and yn both converge to \u03c9. Using the lemma, we can find a point\nz so that \u03c6z (\u03c9) is arbitrarily large, and since both \u03c6z (xn ) and \u03c6z (yn ) converge\nto \u03c6z (\u03c9), for any number N we can find z such that both \u03c6z (xn ) and \u03c6z (yn ) are\ngreater then N for all n sufficiently large.\nHence\n1\n(xn * yn ) \u2265 (\u03c6z (xn ) + \u03c6z (yn )) > N\n2\nfor all n sufficiently large, and so\nlim (xn * yn ) = \u221e,\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n\fBOUNDARIES OF HYPERBOLIC METRIC SPACES\n\nand so (xn ) \u223cG (yk ).\n\n7\n\n\u0003\n\nThese two corollaries mean that we have a well-defined relation \u223c on \u2202d X given\nby \u03c91 \u223c \u03c92 iff given any xn \u2192 \u03c91 and yk \u2192 \u03c92 , we have (xn ) \u223cG (yk ). Furthermore, if \u223cG is an equivalence relation (as it is for hyperbolic spaces), then \u223c is an\nequivalence relation on \u2202d X, and moreover \u2202G X = \u2202d X/ \u223c as sets. As usual, we\nwill denote the equivalence class of a point \u03c9 in the metric boundary by [\u03c9].\nWhat we want is to show that we in fact have \u2202G X = \u2202d X/ \u223c as topological\nspaces. In other words, we need to show that the quotient map is continuous.\nLemma 4.4. Let (X, d) be a proper hyperbolic metric space. If \u03c9n \u2192 \u03c9 in \u2202d X,\nthen [\u03c9n ] \u2192 [\u03c9] in \u2202G X.\nProof. Let \u03b4 > 0 be the hyperbolic constant from (1), xk \u2192 \u03c9 and xn,k \u2192 \u03c9n .\nWe know that we can find z such that \u03c6z (\u03c9) is arbitrarily large, and since we have\n\u03c6z (\u03c9n ) \u2192 \u03c6z (\u03c9), we can choose z such that \u03c6z (\u03c9n ) is also arbitrarily large, for all\nn sufficiently large. Indeed, as in the previous corollaries, we have, given any N > 0\nwe can find a number M such that for all n > M , there is a number Kn such that\n1\n(xn,k * xk ) \u2265 (\u03c6z (xn,k ) + \u03c6z (xk )) > N + 2\u03b4\n2\nfor all k > Kn .\nNow if yn,k \u2192 [\u03c9n ] and yn \u2192 [\u03c9], we know that we can find a subsequence of\neach sequence such that\nlim inf (yn,k * yk ) = lim (yn,kj * ykj ).\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nFurthermore, since xn,j \u2192 [\u03c9n ] we conclude that for any N there is some Jn such\nthat\n(yn,kj * xn,j ) > N + 2\u03b4\nfor all j > Jn , and similarly that there is some J such that\n(ykj * xj ) > N + \u03b4\nfor all j > J.\nHence, given any N , and fixing some n > M , then we have\n(yn,kj * xj ) \u2265 min{(yn,kj * xn,j ), (xn,j * xj )} \u2212 \u03b4 > N + \u03b4\nfor all j > max{Jn , Kn }. But then\n(yn,kj * ykj ) \u2265 min{(yn,kj * xj ), (ykj * xj )} \u2212 \u03b4 > N\nfor all j > max{Jn , Kn , J}. Therefore, for any n > M ,\nlim (yn,kj * ykj ) > N,\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nand so\nlim inf (yn,k * yk ) > N\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nfor all n > M . And since M does not depend on the choice of sequences converging\nto [\u03c9n ] and [\u03c9], we therefore have that\n([\u03c9n ] * [\u03c9]) = inf{lim inf (yn,k * yk ) : yn,k \u2192 [\u03c9n ], yn \u2192 [\u03c9]} > N\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nfor all n > M .\nTherefore\nlim ([\u03c9n ] * [\u03c9]) = \u221e,\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n\f8\n\nCORRAN WEBSTER AND ADAM WINCHESTER\n\nand so [\u03c9n ] \u2192 [\u03c9] in \u2202G X.\n\n\u0003\n\nSo we have proved the following result.\nTheorem 4.5. Let (X, d) be a proper, hyperbolic metric space. Then there is a\nnatural continuous quotient map from \u2202d X onto \u2202G X.\n5. Boundaries of Word-Hyperbolic Groups\nWe observe that if G is a hyperbolic group, then the group acts on either boundary by taking a sequence xk \u2192 \u03c9 and letting\n\u03b1g (\u03c9) = lim gxk .\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nThis is a continuous action on either boundary. Clearly the quotient map is equivariant for these two actions, since if \u03c9 \u223c \u03c9 \u2032 , we can easily see that \u03b1g (\u03c9) \u223c \u03b1g (\u03c9)\nby simply changing the base point of the inner product to g.\nAn action of a topological group G on a topological space X is amenable if there\nis a net of continuous maps (m\u03bb : X \u2192 M1+ (G))\u03bb\u2208\u039b , where M1+ (G) is the set of\nBorel probability measures on G, such that\nlim kg * m\u03bb (x) \u2212 m\u03bb (g * x)k \u2192 0\n\n\u03bb\u2208\u039b\n\nuniformly on compact subsets of G\u00d7X. Such a net of maps is called an approximate\ninvariant continuous mean. It was shown by E. Germain (as discussed in [2, 3])\nthat the action of a word-hyperbolic group G on its Gromov boundary is amenable.\nRieffel pointed out that if there were a continuous, equivariant surjection from \u2202d G\nto the Gromov boundary, then the action of G on the metric boundary must also be\namenable. This is trivial given the above definition, since if q : \u2202d G \u2192 \u2202G G is the\nquotient map of Theorem 4.5, and m\u03bb are the maps in an approximate invariant\ncontinuous mean for the action of G on \u2202G G, then m\u03bb \u25e6 q are an approximate\ninvariant continuous mean for the action of G on \u2202d G.\nCorollary 5.1. If G is word-hyperbolic group with a finite generating set, and d is\nthe word-length metric, then the group action on the metric boundary is amenable.\nThis would seem to open the possibility of replicating Rieffel's work on the metric\nboundary of Zd in the setting of hyperbolic groups. However, Rieffel's procedure\nrelied on the fact that the action of Zd on its metric boundary always has finite\norbits, and it seems unlikely that this criterion holds with any frequency for general\nhyperbolic groups.\nReferences\n[1] J.
