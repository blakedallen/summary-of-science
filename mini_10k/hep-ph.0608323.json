The combined charged current (CC) and neutral current (NC) data from\nSNO and the \u03bd-e\u2212 elastic scattering data from SK experiment showed that the solar \u03bde undergo\nflavour conversion on their way from the central part of the Sun, where they are produced, to the\nEarth. Under the plausible assumption of CPT-invariance, the results of the KL reactor neutrino\nexperiment [4] established the large mixing angle (LMA) MSW oscillations/transitions as the\ndominant mechanism at the origin of the observed solar \u03bde deficit. The existing global neutrino\noscillation data allow us to conclude that the solar \u03bde undergo transitions (predominantly) into\nalmost an equal mixture of \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4 neutrinos. The ratio of the CC and NC event rates observed\nat SNO provided a measure of the solar \u03bde transition probability at energies of E \u223c (5 \u2212 10) MeV,\nwhile the SNO NC data permitted to determine with rather good precision the 8 B component of\nthe solar \u03bde flux [9]. The global solar neutrino data allowed to obtain information on the other\nimportant components of the solar neutrino flux - the fluxes of pp, pep and 7 Be neutrinos, and\nto constrain the flux of CNO neutrinos [10]. The combined solar neutrino and KamLAND data\nlead to a determination of the neutrino oscillation parameters which drive the solar \u03bde oscillations\n- the neutrino mass squared difference \u2206m221 and the mixing angle \u03b812 , with an unexpectedly high\nprecision (see, e.g., [11, 12]).\nThe latest SNO result on the 8 B neutrino flux, \u03c6B , as reported in [9], reads\nC\n\u03c6N\n= 4.94(1 \u00b1 0.088) \u00d7 106 cm\u22122 s\u22121 .\nB\n\n(1)\n\nThis is in good agreement with the Standard Solar Model (SSM) prediction [13]\n\u03c6SSM\n= 5.79(1 \u00b1 0.23) \u00d7 106 cm\u22122 s\u22121 .\nB\n\n(2)\n\nThe global oscillation analysis of the solar neutrino and KamLAND data performed in [11], in\nwhich \u03c6B is treated as a free parameter, yields the following value of the flux:\n\u03c6Global\n= 4.88(1 \u00b1 0.036) \u00d7 106 cm\u22122 s\u22121 .\nB\n\n(3)\n\nThe value of \u03c6B thus obtained corresponds to fB = 0.84, where fB is defined as\nfB =\n\n\u03c6B\n.\n\u03c6SSM\nB\n\n(4)\n\nThe values of the pp and 7 Be neutrino fluxes can also be determined similarly from a global analysis\nof the solar neutrino and KamLAND data, in which the solar luminosity constraint is used [10].\n2\n\nWe would like to recall that the hypothesis of neutrino oscillations was formulated in [5]. In [6] it was suggested\nthat the solar \u03bde can take part in oscillations involving another active or sterile neutrino. The article [6] appeared\nbefore the first data of the Homestake experiment were reported. For a detailed discussion of the evolution of the\nsolar neutrino problem since 1970 and of the variety of different \"solutions\" proposed over the years, see, e.g., [7, 8].\n\n2\n\n\fThis analysis showed that with the current data sets the pp neutrino flux can be determined with\nan uncertainty which is the same as the estimated uncertainty in the SSM prediction for the flux\n[13]. The uncertainty obtained for the 7 Be flux in the same analysis is larger than the estimated\none in the SSM prediction for the same flux [13]. Future high precision measurements of the 7 Be\nneutrino flux by Borexino and KamLAND can lead to a reduction of the uncertainties in both\n7\nBe and pp fluxes determined from the solar neutrino data.\nIn the present article we explore the possibility of using the precision data (current and prospective) on the i) 8 B, ii) 8 B and 7 Be, and iii) 8 B, 7 Be and pp, solar neutrino fluxes in order to obtain\n\"direct\" information (i.e., to constrain or determine) on at least some of the solar model parameters - nuclear reaction rates, opacity, diffusion, heavy element surface abundance, etc., which enter\ninto the calculations of the fluxes in the Standard Solar Model (SSM). It is important to establish\nwhether high precision measurements of the 8 B, 7 Be and pp neutrino fluxes can provide also significant constraints on the indicated SSM parameters because, none of the latter can be determined\ndirectly experimentally. The relevant nuclear reaction rates are measured in direct experiments\nbut at energies which are considerably higher than the energies at which the reactions proceed\nin the central part of the Sun. As a consequence, one has to employ an extrapolation procedure\n(based on nuclear theory) in order to obtain the values of the rates at the energy of interest. The\nsolar luminosity L\u2299 is measured directly with very high accuracy. However, it is still important\nto determine this fundamental solar observable from solar neutrino flux measurements. The latter\nprovide \"real time\" information on the rates of the nuclear fusion reactions in the central region of\nthe Sun. Both the photons, observed in the form of solar luminosity, and the neutrinos, emitted\nby the Sun, are simultaneously produced in these reactions. It takes neutrinos approximately 8\nminutes to reach the Earth. In contrast, the \"conventionally\" measured luminosity of the Sun is\ndetermined by photons emitted by the solar surface, which, however, were produced in the central\nregion of the Sun \u223c 4 \u00d7 104 years earlier - the time it takes these photons to reach the surface of\nthe Sun (see, e.g., [14]). Thus, a comparison of the experimentally measured solar luminosity with\nthat obtained from neutrino flux measurements allows, in particular, to test the thermo-nuclear\nfusion theory of energy generation in the Sun and the hypothesis that the Sun, in what concerns\nthe energy generation, taking place in its interior, and the energy radiation from its surface, is in\nan approximate steady state.\nAnother SSM parameter on which the solar neutrino fluxes depend is the ratio of the surface\nabundance in mass of the elements heavier than helium and of the surface abundance (in mass) of\nhydrogen (surface heavy element composition), Z/X. At present there is rather large uncertainty\nin the SSM estimated value of this parameter (see, e.g., [13, 15]), as will be discussed in somewhat\ngreater detail further. Moreover, the estimated uncertainty in the value of Z/X is obtained\n[13, 15] assuming that the total spread of all modern determinations of Z/X is equal to the 3\u03c3\nuncertainty in Z/X. Clearly, a determination of the surface element composition parameter Z/X\nfrom neutrino flux measurements could be very helpful for resolving the indicated problems. It\ncould also be very useful for solar model building.\nIn the analysis that follows we will use the SSM by Bahcall and Pinsonneault from 2004 [13]\nas a \"benchmark\" solar model for the predictions of the solar neutrino fluxes and the estimated\nuncertainties in these predictions, originating from the different SSM parameters.\n\n3\n\n\f2\n\nPreliminary Observations\n\nThere are six principal nuclear reactions and decays in which neutrinos are produced in the Sun\n(see, e.g., [16]). Four of them generate neutrinos with continuous energy spectrum. These are the\nfusion of two protons (pp \u03bd's), and the decays of the nuclei 8 B (8 B \u03bd's), 13 N and 15 O (CNO \u03bd's).\nThe other two, the fusion of two protons and electron and the capture of an electron by a 7 Be\nnucleus produce neutrino lines (the so-called pep and 7 Be \u03bd's). The shapes of the energy spectra of\nthe pp, 8 B and CNO neutrinos are determined by nuclear physics and are well known. However,\nthe SSM predictions for the total values of the pp, pep, 7 Be, 8 B and the CNO neutrino fluxes\ndepend on several SSM input parameters. The uncertainties associated with these parameters\nlead to (normalisation) uncertainties in the predicted fluxes.\nThere are altogether 11 input SSM parameters on which the SSM predictions for the 8 B,\n7\nBe, pp and the CNO solar neutrino fluxes in general depend [13]. These are first of all the Sfactors (see, e.g., [17]) of the nuclear reactions 1 H(p, e+ \u03bde )2 H, 3 He(3 He, 2p)4He,3 He(4 He, \u03b3)7 Be,\n14\nN(p, \u03b3)15 O, 7 Be(p, \u03b3)8 B, and of e\u2212 capture on 7 Be. They are standardly denoted respectively\nby S11 , S33 , S34 , S1,14 , S17 and Se\u2212 7 . The additional parameters are directly related to the physics\nof the Sun: they are [13] the solar luminosity, L\u2299 , age, \u03c4\u2299 , opacity, O\u2299 , diffusion, D\u2299 , and the\nratio of the mass fractions of the elements heavier than helium and of hydrogen at the surface of\nthe Sun (surface composition), Z/X . The type of dependence of a given solar neutrino flux (8 B,\n7\nBe, pp, pep and CNO) on a specific SSM parameter varies with the flux. For the three fluxes of\ninterest for our further discussion, for instance, we have [17]:\n\u03c6B = CB (S11 )\u22122.59 (S33 )\u22120.40 (S34 )+0.81 (S1,14 )+0.01 (S17 )+1.0 (Se\u2212 7 )\u22121.0\n\u00d7(L\u2299 )+6.76 (\u03c4\u2299 )+1.28 (O\u2299 )\u22122.93 (D\u2299 )\u22122.20 (Z/X)+1.36 ,\n\u03c6Be = CBe (S11 )\u22120.97 (S33 )\u22120.43 (S34 )+0.86 (L\u2299 )+3.40 (\u03c4\u2299 )+0.69 (O\u2299 )\u22121.49 (D\u2299 )\u22120.96 (Z/X)+0.62 ,\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\n\u03c6pp = Cpp (S11 )+0.14 (S33 )+0.03 (S34 )\u22120.06 (S1,14 )\u22120.02 (L\u2299 )+0.73 (\u03c4\u2299 )\u22120.07 (O\u2299 )+0.14 (D\u2299 )+0.13 (Z/X)\u22120.08 ,\n(7)\nwhere CB , CBe and Cpp are constants.\nThe nuclear reaction S-factors of interest are measured typically at c.m. energies exceeding\n\u223c 500 keV, which are at least by a factor \u223c 25 larger than those corresponding to the conditions\nunder which the reactions take place in the central region of the Sun. As a consequence, the results\non the S-factors obtained experimentally have to be extrapolated to the much lower energy of \u223c 20\nkeV, which is of interest for the solar neutrino flux calculations. The extrapolation procedure brings\nadditional theoretical uncertainty in the S-factor values. This uncertainty can be substantial for\na given S-factor.\nBecause of the importance of the S17 -factor for the prediction of \u03c6B and the interpretation of\nthe data of the Homestake, SK and SNO experiments, considerable efforts have been made to determine it with a relatively high precision. This was done using data i) from a direct measurement\nof the cross-section of the reaction p +7 Be \u21928 B + \u03b3 [18], and ii) of indirect studies of the same\nreaction (via the Coulomb dissociation process \u03b3 +8 B \u2192 p +7 Be [19], and heavy-ion transfer and\nbreakup processes [20, 21]). In the SSM calculations of the solar neutrino fluxes [13] the most\n4\n\n\fprecise result reported in [18] is used. The value recommended in [18] reads:\nS17 (0) = 21.4 \u00b1 0.5 (expt) \u00b1 0.6 (theo) eV b,\n\n(8)\n\nthe quoted 1\u03c3 error being smaller than 5% 3 . However, from a more recent data, obtained with\nradioactive ion beams, the following value was found in [21]: S17 (0) = 18.2 \u00b1 1.7 eV b. One\nof the theoretical uncertainties in the value of S17 quoted above, eq. (8), is associated with the\nextrapolation method used to obtain this result. In [23] it is argued that a larger extrapolation\nerror, than is usually taken into account, should be assigned in the evaluation of the uncertainties\nin S17 (0).\nAccording to ref. [13], the largest contribution to the uncertainties in the predictions of the\nfluxes of neutrinos produced in the reactions of the pp-chain in the Sun (8 B, 7 Be, pp, pep), is due\nto the uncertainty in the knowledge of the S-factor S34 . The estimated 1\u03c3 uncertainty in S34 is\napproximately 9.4% [13]. The S34 factor has been measured recently [24] at four values of the c.m.\nenergy from the interval (400 - 950) keV. Using an extrapolation of earlier and the new results to\nan energy of \u223c 20 keV, the authors of [24] obtain S34 = 0.53 \u00b1 0.02 \u00b1 0.01. If this result will be\nconfirmed, that would lead to a reduction of the 1\u03c3 uncertainty in the value of S34 approximately\nby a factor of 2. The LUNA collaboration is planning to perform a more precise measurement of\nS34 in an experiment which is under preparation at the Gran-Sasso National Laboratory in Italy\n[25].\nIn the case of the CNO neutrinos, the largest nuclear physics uncertainty is associated with the\nuncertainty in the value of the cross-section of the reaction p +14 N \u219215 O + \u03b3, which is directly\nrelated to the S-factor S1,14 (see Table 2).\nIn what concerns the uncertainties in the predictions of the solar neutrino fluxes due to the other\nnon-nuclear physics parameters, the largest, according to the SSM BP04 [13], is a consequence\nof the lack of sufficiently precise knowledge of the surface element composition of the Sun. New\nvalues for the abundances in mass of the elements C, N, O, Ne and Ar have been derived [26]\nusing three-dimensional rather than one-dimensional model of the solar atmosphere, including\nhydrodynamical effects, etc. The new abundance estimates together with the best-estimates for\nother solar abundances [27] imply Z/X = 0.0176, which is considerably smaller than the earlier\nresult [27] Z/X = 0.0229. The new values of the solar surface abundances of C, N, O, Ne and\nAr, when incorporated into solar models, lead to serious discrepancies with helioseismological data\n[13, 28, 15] 4 . The estimated uncertainty in the value of Z/X, according to [13], is approximately\n15% (see Table 2). The latter is obtained [13, 15] 5 assuming that the total spread of all modern\ndeterminations of Z/X is equal to the 3\u03c3 uncertainty in Z/X.\nIt is pertinent to point out that the knowledge of the solar neutrino oscillation parameters\n\u2206m221 and sin2 \u03b812 with relatively small uncertainties can be crucial for a successful high precision\nThe earlier recommended value [22], S17 (0) = 19+4\n\u22122 eV b, had a 1\u03c3 uncertainty of approximately 15%.\n4\nFor this reason the authors of our \"benchmark\" SSM BP04 did not include the new most recent estimate of\nthe parameter Z/X in the calculations of the solar neutrino fluxes. The possible effects of this new result on the\nSSM predictions of the solar neutrino fluxes were considered in [28, 15].\n5\nThe authors of [15] made a comment worth quoting concerning the uncertainties in the element abundances\nunder discussion: \"Estimating the uncertainty in an abundance determination is even more difficult than arriving\nat a best-estimate abundance.\".\n3\n\n5\n\n\fdetermination of the fluxes of solar 8 B, 7 Be and pp neutrinos. The existing data allow a determination of \u2206m221 and sin2 \u03b812 at 3\u03c3 with an error of approximately 11% and 25%, respectively. Much\nhigher precision can (and most likely will) be achieved in the future. The data from phase-III of\nthe SNO experiment [9] using 3 He proportional counters for the neutral current rate measurement\ncould lead to a reduction of the error in sin2 \u03b812 to 21% [29, 30]. If instead of 766.3 t yr one uses\nsimulated 3 kt yr KamLAND data in the same global solar and reactor neutrino data analysis, the\n3\u03c3 errors in \u2206m221 and sin2 \u03b812 diminish to 7% and 18% [30]. The most precise measurement of\n\u2206m221 , could be achieved [29] using Super-Kamiokande doped with 0.1% of Gadolinium (SK-Gd)\nfor detection of reactor \u03bd\u0304e [31]: the SK detector gets the same flux of reactor \u03bd\u0304e as KamLAND\nand after 3 years of data-taking, \u2206m221 could be determined with an error of 3.5% at 3\u03c3 [29].\nA dedicated reactor \u03bd\u0304e experiment with a baseline L \u223c 60 km, tuned to the minimum of the \u03bd\u0304e\nsurvival probability, could provide the most precise determination of sin2 \u03b812 [32]: with statistics\nof \u223c 60 GW kt yr and a systematic error of 2% (5%), sin2 \u03b812 could be measured with an accuracy\nof 6% (9%) at 3\u03c3 [30]. The inclusion of the uncertainty in \u03b813 (sin2 \u03b813 <0.05) in the analyzes increases the quoted errors by (1\u20133)% to approximately 9% (12%) [30]. Even higher precision in the\nmeasurement of \u2206m221 and sin2 \u03b812 can be reached with one module (of 147 kt fiducial mass) of the\nwater \u010cerenkov detector MEMPHYS doped with 0.1% of Gadolinium (MEMPHYS-Gd), and with\na 50 kt scale liquid scintillator detector (LENA), installed in the Frejus underground laboratory\n[33]. The improved determination of \u2206m221 and \u03b812 with KamLAND or dedicated post-KamLAND\nreactor neutrino experiments has been studied also, e.g., in refs. [34, 35, 36], whereas the potential\nimprovements of the precision on these parameters from future solar neutrino experiments has\nbeen investigated, e.g., in refs. [30, 32, 10].\n\n3\n\nPresent Knowledge and Future Measurements of Solar\nNeutrino Fluxes\n\nPrecise knowledge of solar neutrino fluxes is a key ingredient of our analysis. In this Section, we\nsummarise the presently existing data and information on solar neutrino fluxes and the improvements in the determination of the fluxes that are possible in the future.\nAmong all the eight solar neutrino fluxes, at present we only have a direct experimental determination of the total 8 B neutrino flux produced inside the Sun, through the measurement of\nthe rate of the neutral current reaction on deuterium in the SNO experiment (cf. eq. (1)). The\n1\u03c3 uncertainty in the value of the 8 B neutrino flux determined from the NC SNO data is approximately 8.8% (see eq. (1)). Global oscillation analyses of solar and KamLAND data, in which the\n8\nB neutrino flux is treated as a free parameter, allow to determine \u03c6B with even higher precision,\nas eq. (3) shows. In Fig. 1 we present the range of allowed values of fB (defined in eq. (4)),\nobtained in analyzes of the current data and of prospective data from future experiments. The\ncorresponding 1\u03c3 uncertainties in fB are given in Table 1. Combining the results from other solar\nneutrino experiments with the NC data from SNO improves the precision of determination of the\nsolar neutrino oscillations parameters \u2206m221 and sin2 \u03b812 and hence reduces the 1\u03c3 error on the\n8\nB neutrino flux to 4.4%. This is further reduced to 3.6% by addition of the KamLAND results\nin the global data analysis. Also shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1 are the expected uncertainty on\n6\n\n\fData set used\n1\u03c3 uncertainty in fB (in %)\nSolar\n4.4\nSolar + KamLAND\n3.6\nSolar + SNO-III + KamLAND\n3.2\nSolar + SNO-III + pp + KamLAND\n2.5\nSolar + SNO-III + pp + SPMIN\n1.7\nTable 1: 1 \u03c3 uncertainties of fB\nfB with inclusion of prospective data from future planned/proposed experiments. The phase-III\nof SNO is expected to provide direct (uncorrelated) measurement of the NC event rate with a\nprecision greater than that achieved in the earlier salt phase. For the third phase data from SNO\nwe have assumed the same central values of the CC and NC event rates as those observed during\nthe salt phase, but smaller uncertainties in the measured CC and NC rates, namely, 4.0% and\n6.4% respectively [37]. With the inclusion of the indicated prospective results from this phase\n(referred to as SNO-III in Fig. 1 and Table 1), the 1\u03c3 uncertainty in fB could be reduced to\n3.2%. This uncertainty would further diminish to 2.5% and 1.7% if we added successively to the\nanalysis the prospective data from a \"generic pp\" and from \"SPMIN\" experiments. The \"generic\npp\" experiment in Fig. 1 and Table 1 refers to a high precision \u03bd \u2212e\u2212 elastic scattering experiment\n6\nwith assumed 1% error in the measured reaction rate. The latter is simulated at the best-fit\nvalues of \u2206m221 = 8 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 and sin2 \u03b812 = 0.31. The \"SPMIN\" refers to a reactor experiment\nwith a baseline of 60 km, tuned to the Survival Probability MINimum [32]. The results given in\nFig. 1 and Table 1 for this experiment correspond to statistics of 3 kt yr of data and a systematic\nerror of 2%. We refer the reader to [30, 32] for further details of our method used for the analysis\nof projected data from future experiments.\nThe SSM prediction for 7 Be neutrino flux reads:\n\u03c6SSM\n= 4.86(1 \u00b1 0.12) \u00d7 109 cm\u22122 sec\u22121 ,\nBe\n\n(9)\n\nthe estimated uncertainty being 12%.

Below we summarise the results obtained for the 7 Be and pp neutrino fluxes using\npresent and future prospective data from solar neutrino experiments [10]. The results for \u03c6pp\ndepend on whether the luminosity constraint [39] is included in the analysis or not; the determination of \u03c6Be is essentially independent of the luminosity constraint [10]. Without employing the\n6\n\nThere are a number of planned sub-MeV solar neutrino experiments (LowNu Experiments) aiming to observe\nand measure directly the pp neutrino flux using either charged current reactions (LENS, MOON, SIREN [38]) or\nthe \u03bd \u2212 e\u2212 elastic scattering process (XMASS, CLEAN, HERON, MUNU, GENIUS [38]).\n\n7\n\n\fSolar\nSolar+KL\nSolar + SNO III + KL\nSolar +SNO III + pp + KL\nSolar + SNO III + pp + SPMIN\n12\n11\n10\n9\n\n3\u03c3\n\n8\n\n\u2206\u03c7\n\n2\n\n7\n6\n5\n4\n\n2\u03c3\n\n3\n2\n1\n0\n0.7\n\n1\u03c3\n\n0.75\n\n0.8\n\n0.85\n\n0.9\n\n0.95\n\nfB\n\nFigure 1: The dependence of \u2206\u03c72 on fB , showing the range of allowed values of fB , determined\nusing the currently existing data and prospective data from future experiments.\n\nluminosity constraint, both \u03c6Be and \u03c6pp are determined from the existing data with a precision\nwhich is much worse than the estimated precision of the BP04 SSM predictions for the two fluxes.\nThe inclusion of the luminosity constraint in the analysis brings about a drastic improvement in\nthe determination of \u03c6pp : even with the present solar and KamLAND data, \u03c6pp is determined with\nan uncertainty of approximately 2% at 1\u03c3.\nImprovement in the determination of \u03c6Be will be possible from a direct measurement of the\n7\nBe neutrino flux, as is envisaged in the forthcoming Borexino solar neutrino [40] and KamLAND\nexperiments [41]. Data from the Borexino experiment with a total 1\u03c3 error of 10% could lead to a\ndetermination of the 7 Be neutrino flux with a 1\u03c3 uncertainty of \u223c 10%, which is somewhat smaller\nthan the estimated uncertainty in the BP04 SSM prediction for \u03c6Be (see eq.(9)). With a total\nuncertainty of 5% in the measured event rate in Borexino, \u03c6Be is expected to be determined with\n1\u03c3 error of 5.5%, while a measurement of the Borexino event rate with an error of 3% could lead\nto a factor of three improvement in the precision on \u03c6Be with respect to the currently estimated\n12% uncertainty in the SSM prediction for \u03c6Be .\nPrecision data from the Borexino experiment is expected to bring also a significant improvement\nin the precision of determination of \u03c6pp. As long as the luminosity constraint is imposed, a\nmeasurement of the Borexino event rate with a 5% error could lead to a determination of \u03c6pp with\n\n8\n\n\fa 1\u03c3 uncertainty of 0.5%. The addition of a high precision data from a \"generic pp\" experiment is\nnot expected to lead to any significant reduction of the uncertainty in the value of \u03c6pp as long as the\nluminosity constraint is taken into account [10]. However, the data from these experiments could\ncertainly improve noticeably the precision of the pp flux determination, which can be achieved\nwithout using the luminosity constraint. Moreover, it should be possible to test the applicability\nof the photon luminosity constraint itself and, more generally, the thermo-nuclear theory of the\nenergy generation in the Sun, by comparing the measured value of the solar photon luminosity\nwith the value obtained using the results from the LowNu and the other solar neutrino experiments\n[10].\n\n4\n\nDetermining the SSM Input Parameters from Direct Solar Neutrino Flux Measurements\n\nIn the theoretical framework of the SSM, the dependence of the solar neutrino flux from the ith\nnuclear process, \u03c6i , on the input parameters of the SSM is given, as we have already seen on the\nexamples of the 8 B, 7 Be and pp fluxes, by power laws:\n\u03c6i = Ci \u00d7\n\nY\n\n\u03b1\n\nxj ij .\n\n(11)\n\nall j\n\nHere Ci is a constant and \u03b1ij in the exponent is the logarithmic derivative of \u03c6i with respect to\nthe SSM input parameter xj ,\n\u2202 ln \u03c6i\n.\n\u2202 ln xj\n\n\u03b1ij =\n\n(12)\n\nThe values of the different logarithmic derivatives for the BP04 SSM [13] are given in Table 2. We\nhave, in general, eight such equations for the eight different solar neutrino fluxes 7 .\nLet us first consider a general formulation of the problem where we assume that we have a\ntotal of N input parameters in the solar model calculations and that out of the total eight fluxes,\nK different fluxes along with their 1\u03c3 uncertainties can be determined from direct measurements.\nWe can then pick up the set of K equations from the above set (11) and can solve them for any\nsubset xj1 , xj2 , .., xjK of K different input parameters of the solar model. For the rest of (N-K)\nparameters xj we can use the values xj 0 found in the SSM. We can express the constants Ci 's in\nterms \u03c6SSM\n's and x0j 's using the equation\ni\n\u03c6SSM\n= Ci \u00d7\ni\n\nY\n\n(x0j )\u03b1ij .\n\n(13)\n\nall j\n7\n\nIn this counting we have included also the fluxes of hep and 17 F solar neutrinos [13], which, however, are\npredicted to be exceedingly small.

The extreme right column of Table\n3 gives the factor by which the central values of different parameters will change with respect\nto their values as used in the BP04 SSM [13] if we use the measured 8 B neutrino flux, given in\neq. (3), for their calculations. Note that if the measured mean value of \u03c6B differs from the value\npredicted by the SSM, \u03c6SSM\n, the value of the parameter xj1 obtained using eq. (25) would differ\nB\nfrom its SSM predicted value x0j1 by a factor controlled by the corresponding logarithmic derivative\nln \u03c6B\n\u03b1B,j1 = \u2202\u2202 ln\n.\nxj1\nWe present in Table 3 the uncertainty of each of the SSM input parameters, evaluated from eq.\n(26), for three different \"benchmark\" values of the uncertainty in the measured 8 B neutrino flux.\nFor comparison we have also included in column 5 of Table 3 the estimated uncertainties in the\nSSM parameters in the BP04 SSM. It follows from eq. (26) that the relative uncertainty in the\nparameter xj1 depends on the inverse power of the magnitude of the corresponding logarithmic\nderivative \u03b1B,j1 . It should be clear from eq. (5) and Table 2 that since the relevant logarithmic\n12\n\n\fderivatives in the cases of the S-factors S33 and S1,14 are relatively small, these quantities cannot\nbe determined with smaller uncertainties by using even a high precision measurement of the 8 B\nneutrino flux. We therefore do not show the results for these cases in Table 3. It follows from\nthe results reported in Table 3, in particular, that the SSM parameters like S11 , Z/X, L\u2299 and\nO\u2299 can be determined with uncertainties less than 10% owing to the relatively large values of\ntheir corresponding logarithmic derivatives. For the uncertainty in diffusion parameter D\u2299 we get\napproximately 10.6%. The table shows also that using a direct high precision measurement of the\n8\nB neutrino flux can allow to determine the parameter Z/X with an uncertainty which is smaller\nthan its currently estimated uncertainty in the BP04 SSM [13]. At the same time, the parameter\nS17 is determined much less precisely - with uncertainty of 25%, in spite of the fact that \u03c6B \u221d S17 .\nWe see from Table 3 that the uncertainties of most of the SSM parameters under discussion\nare essentially stable when the 1\u03c3 error in the measured 8 B neutrino flux changes from 2% to\n4%. The reason for such a behavior is that for very small values of \u2206\u03c6B /\u03c6B , the first term in the\nright hand side of eq. (26) is much smaller than the second term which controls the uncertainty\n\u2206xj1 /xj1 . In Fig. 2 we have plotted the fractional uncertainty in each of the SSM parameters as\na function of the 1\u03c3 error in the measured value of the 8 B neutrino flux 8 . Figure 2 shows that if\nthe 8 B flux uncertainty is larger than \u223c 5%, the first term in eq. (26) would dominate over the\nsecond and \u2206xj /xj can exhibit a stronger dependence on the uncertainty \u2206\u03c6B /\u03c6B . The degree of\nthis dependence is controlled by the corresponding \u03b1Bj1 value. However, as we have shown before\n(cf. Fig. 1 and Table 1), the uncertainty in the value of fB , determined from the current data, is\nalready approximately 4%. The second term in eq. (26) is dominant and we do not expect any\nsignificant improvement of the precision of determination of the SSM input parameters with more\nprecise measurement of \u03c6B alone. Small improvements can nonetheless be expected, especially in\nwhat concerns the precision of determination of Z/X.\n\n6\n\nDetermining Two SSM Input Parameters Using Measured 8B and 7Be Neutrino Fluxes\n\nAs we have discussed in Section 3, a relatively high precision measurement of the 7 Be neutrino\nflux can be performed by the Borexino experiment. The KamLAND experiments can also provide\nvaluable data on \u03c6Be . One could use the experimentally measured values of the 8 B and 7 Be\nneutrino fluxes to determine any two of the SSM input parameters 9 . Equations (19) and (24) for\n8\n\nObviously, the uncertainty in the value of a given SSM input parameter determined exploiting a solar neutrino\nflux measurement depends also on the uncertainties in the remaining SSM input parameters used in the evaluation.\n9\nWe have also examined the uncertainties of the SSM parameters one obtains if only high precision prospective\ndata on the 7 Be neutrino flux is used to determine the parameters. We have found, in particular, that S33 and\nS34 can be determined with a precision of 43.3% (33%) and 17.2% (12%), respectively, if the 7 Be neutrino flux is\nmeasured with 1\u03c3 error of 10% (2%). This should be compared with the uncertainties of 76% and 30% in S33 and\nS34 we have obtained in the previous Section, using 8 B neutrino flux measurement with 4% uncertainty. Even if\nwe take the 1\u03c3 error in \u03c6Be to be 2%, all the other SSM parameters are detrmined with uncertainties which are\nlarger than those we found in Section 5 when the same parameters are determined from the measured \u03c6B with 1\u03c3\nerror of 4%.\n\n13\n\n\f100\n\n11\n\nS11\n\n10.5\n\n38\n\nS33\n\n95\n\nS34\n\n36\n\n90\n\n10\n\n34\n\n85\n9.5\n\n80\n\n9\n\n75\n\n8.5\n\n70\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n30\n\n32\n30\n\n0\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n15\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n4\n\nS17\n\nLO.\n\nZ/X\n\n14\n\n3.8\n\n28\n\n12\n3.6\n26\n\n10\n3.4\n\n24\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n0\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n23\n\n15\n\n8\n\n0\n\n12.5\n\n\u03c4O\n.\n\n22\n\nOO.\n\n9\n\n21\n\nDO.\n\n12\n11.5\n\n8.5\n\n11\n\n20\n8\n\n10.5\n\n19\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n0\n\n10\n\n5\n\n15\n\n0\n\n30\n\nSe-7\n28\n\nx axis = \u2206\u03c6B/\u03c6B (%)\n\n26\n\ny axis = \u2206xj /xj (%)\n1\n\n24\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n1\n\n15\n\u2206x\n\nFigure 2: The 1\u03c3 fractional uncertainty ( xj j1 ) of the various SSM input parameters as a function\n1\nof the uncertainty in the measured 8 B neutrino flux (\u2206\u03c6B /\u03c6B ).\n14\n\n\fName of model\nparameters (xj1 )\n\n\u2206\u03c6B\n\u03c6B\n\n= 2%\n9.05\n30.01\n24.80\n3.35\n9.11\n19.18\n7.69\n10.54\n25.08\n\nS11\nS34\nS17\nLuminosity L\u2299\nZ/X\nAge of sun\nOpacity O\u2299\nDiffusion D\u2299\nSe \u2212 7\n\n\u2206xj1\n(%)\nxj1\n\u2206\u03c6B\n= 3%\n\u03c6B\n\n\u2206x0j\n\n1\n\nx0j\n\n\u2206\u03c6B\n\u03c6B\n\n= 4%\n9.16\n30.44\n25.12\n3.39\n9.48\n19.42\n7.79\n10.66\n25.40\n\n9.10\n30.19\n24.94\n3.37\n9.27\n19.28\n7.73\n10.59\n25.22\n\nxj1\nx0j\n\n(%)\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.4\n9.4\n3.8\n0.4\n15.0\n0.4\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n\n1.07\n0.81\n0.84\n0.97\n0.88\n0.87\n1.06\n1.08\n1.19\n\nTable 3: The uncertainties for each of the SSM input parameters, which are expected to be\nobtained if a high precision direct measurement of the 8 B neutrino flux is used to determine the\ncorresponding SSM parameter.

The relative uncertainties on the SSM\nparameters thus determined are also given.\nthese sets of two parameters, assuming a measurement of 8 B and 7 Be neutrino fluxes respectively\nwith 4% and 6% uncertainty 10 . The uncertainties of xj1 and xj2 , as given in eqs. (29) and (30),\nare controlled in a rather complicated way by both the magnitude and the relative signs of the\ndifferent logarithmic derivatives. However, it follows from eqs. (29) and (30) that if for a certain\npair of SSM parameters xj1 and xj2 the relation \u03b1B,j2 /\u03b1B,j1 \u223c\n= \u03b1Be,j2 /\u03b1Be,j1 holds, these parameters\nwould be determined with poor accuracy even if one uses high precision data on the 8 B and 7 Be\nneutrino fluxes. Table 2 suggests that such pairs can be, for instance, {S33 , S34 }, {L\u2299 , O\u2299 } and\n{Z/X, D\u2299 }.\nAmong the solar physics parameters the opacity O\u2299 can be determined with a 9% uncertainty\nin pair with S34 , or S17 , or Se\u2212 7 , for which we get at the same time uncertainty of approximately\n16%. For the diffusion D\u2299 we find an uncertainty of 11% when determined in combination with\nS33 or S34 . In these cases, however, S33 and S34 are found within 36% and 14%, respectively.\nIn Table 4 we present results only for those combinations of two SSM parameters which are\ndetermined with an uncertainty smaller than 15% using directly measured values of \u03c6B and \u03c6Be . It\nis interesting to note from Table 4 that the set {S34 ,Z/X} can be determined with a relatively good\nprecision: the predicted uncertainty of Z/X is smaller than the estimated one within the BP04 SSM\n[13], while the uncertainty in S34 is approximately 14.3%. The latter should be compared with the\n1\u03c3 error of 9.4%, quoted when S34 is obtained using the data on the reaction 3 He+4 He \u21927 Be+\u03b3.\nThe parameter S34 can be determined with 12.7% uncertainty in the combination {S34 , S11 }. As\ncan be seen by comparing Table 3 with Table 4, one gets a somewhat better precision on Z/X if\nthe value of Z/X is obtained from the experimental information on the 8 B neutrino flux only 11 .\nHowever, the uncertainty in the determination of S34 can be much smaller when in addition to\nthe data on the 7 Be neutrino flux one uses the data on the 8 B neutrino flux as well.\nIn Table 5 we present results on the uncertainties of the parameter combination {Z/X,S34 },\ndetermined from data on the 8 B and 7 Be neutrino fluxes. The results correspond to 1\u03c3 errors of\n2%, 3% and 4% in the measured value of the 8 B neutrino flux, and of 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 10%\nin the measured value of \u03c6Be .

We take different combinations of three SSM parameters and calculate their\nuncertainties using 3%, 4% and 1% as illustrative 1\u03c3 errors in the measured values of 8 B, 7 Be\nand pp neutrino fluxes, respectively. We find that for almost all solar model parameters, the\nuncertainties reduce when using the combined information on the 7 B, 8 Be and pp neutrino fluxes,\ncompared to what we have obtained by using only prospective data on 8 B and/or 7 Be fluxes. In\nTable 6 we present results only for those sets of three SSM input parameters which are determined\nwith uncertainties smaller than 15% each.\nAs Table 6 shows, the most precise determination of S34 occurs in the combination {S34 , L\u2299 , Se\u2212 7 },\nwhile Z/X is best determined in the sets {S17 , L\u2299 , Z/X} and {Se\u2212 7 , L\u2299 , Z/X}. For both these\nparameters the uncertainties we get are smaller than those in the respective BP04 SSM predictions.\nNote also that we get a rather accurate determination of S17 from the combination {S34 , S17 , L\u2299 },\nand of L\u2299 from {S34 , L\u2299 , Z/X}. Although the uncertainty on S17 thus obtained of \u223c(8% - 10%)\nis larger than the currently estimated uncertainty in the value of S17 found from relevant nuclear\nreaction data (see Section 2), our results on S17 can be used, in particular, as a consistency check,\ne.g., of the extrapolation procedure employed to get S17 from the data. In what concerns the other\nparameters, we get the best determination of S11 from {S11 , , L\u2299 , Se\u2212 7 }, of D\u2299 from {S17 , L\u2299 , D\u2299 },\nand of \u03c4\u2299 from {S17 , L\u2299 , \u03c4\u2299 }.\nWe stress that even though the precision we get for L\u2299 is worse than the precision achieved\nin the direct measurement of L\u2299 , the method we used to determine L\u2299 allows to perform a\n19\n\n\fcombinations\nxj1\nxj2\nxj3\nS11 S34\nL\u2299\nS11 L\u2299\nO\u2299\nS34 L\u2299 Z/X\nS34 L\u2299\nO\u2299\nS34 L\u2299\nD\u2299\nS34 L\u2299\n\u03c4\u2299\nS11 S17\nL\u2299\nS11 L\u2299\nSe \u2212 7\nS33 S17\nL\u2299\nS33 L\u2299\nSe \u2212 7\nS34 S17\nL\u2299\nS34 L\u2299\nSe \u2212 7\nS17 L\u2299 Z/X\nS17 L\u2299\n\u03c4\u2299\nS17 L\u2299\nO\u2299\nS17 L\u2299\nD\u2299\nL\u2299 Z/X Se\u2212 7\nL\u2299\n\u03c4\u2299\nSe \u2212 7\nL\u2299 O\u2299\nSe \u2212 7\nL\u2299 D\u2299 Se\u2212 7\n\n\u2206xj1\nxj2\n\n\u2206xj2\nxj2\n\n(%)\n\n6.16\n13.67\n8.87\n10.45\n9.03\n11.40\n4.73\n4.53\n12.40\n13.43\n8.61\n6.33\n9.26\n9.05\n9.21\n9.74\n1.21\n1.85\n1.84\n1.73\n\n(%)\n\n7.98\n1.72\n1.00\n1.69\n1.57\n1.66\n11.05\n1.73\n8.47\n1.95\n8.98\n1.85\n1.21\n1.85\n1.84\n1.74\n6.65\n7.42\n3.40\n4.68\n\n\u2206xj3\n(%)\nxj3\n\n1.62\n12.25\n8.63\n5.31\n5.77\n12.86\n1.73\n11.05\n1.95\n8.47\n1.86\n8.98\n6.65\n7.34\n3.40\n4.68\n9.88\n9.29\n9.48\n10.12\n\nTable 6: The fractional uncertainties in different combinations of the SSM input parameters for\nwhich we get uncertainty smaller than 15%, assuming 3%, 4% and 1% errors in the \"measured\"\n\u03c6B , \u03c6Be and \u03c6pp neutrino fluxes, respectively.\nfundamental test of the thermo-nuclear fusion theory of energy generation in the Sun, as well as\nto test the hypothesis that the Sun is in an approximate steady state in what regards the energy\nproduced in its central region and the energy emitted from its surface.\n\n8\n\nConclusions\n\nIn the present article we have studied the possibility of using the precision data (current and\nprospective) on the i) 8 B, ii) 8 B and 7 Be, and iii) 8 B, 7 Be and pp, solar neutrino fluxes in order\nto obtain \"direct\" information (i.e., to constrain or determine) on at least some of the eleven\nsolar model parameters - opacity, diffusion, heavy element surface abundance, nuclear reaction\nS-factors, etc., which enter into the calculations of the fluxes in the Standard Solar Model (SSM).\nOur work was inspired by the remarkable progress made in the studies of solar neutrinos in\nthe last several years, which led to an unexpectedly precise determination of the solar neutrino\noscillation parameters and of the 8 B neutrino flux, as well as by the prospects for high precision\n20\n\n\fmeasurements of the 7 Be and pp neutrino fluxes. It was stimulated also by the realization that\nthe solar physics parameters like the opacity (O\u2299 ), diffusion (D\u2299 ) and heavy element surface\nabundance (Z/X), can never be measured in direct experiments. The solar photon luminosity L\u2299\nis measured directly with very high accuracy. However, the \"conventionally\" measured luminosity\nof the Sun is determined by photons produced in the central region of the Sun, which took \u223c 4\u00d7104\nyears to reach the surface of the Sun from which they are emitted (see, e.g., [14]). The luminosity\ndetermined from solar neutrino flux measurements provides \"real time\" information on the rates\nof nuclear fusion reactions in the central region of the Sun, in which the solar energy is generated:\nneutrinos are simultaneously produced in these reactions with the photons observed in the form\nof solar luminosity, but it takes solar neutrinos approximately only 8 minutes to reach the Earth.\nSimilar considerations apply, perhaps to somewhat less extent, to the S-factors S11 , S33 , S34 , S1,14\nand S17 , directly related to the rates of the nuclear fusion reactions, on which the SSM predictions\nfor the solar neutrino fluxes depend and in which the solar energy is generated. They can be\nand are measured in direct experiments on Earth. However, this is done at energies which are\nconsiderably higher than the energies at which the reactions take place in the central part of the\nSun. As a consequence, one has to employ an extrapolation procedure (based on nuclear theory)\nin order to obtain the values of the rates at the energy of interest, corresponding to the physical\nconditions in the central part of the Sun.\nWe have derived the basic equations for determining the central values of the SSM input\nparameters and their uncertainties using results of direct measurements of solar neutrino fluxes\n(Section 4, eqs. (19) and (24)). If we have r measured solar neutrino fluxes, at most r SSM input\nparameters can be determined using the data on the solar neutrino fluxes. For the remaining SSM\nparameters we have to use the SSM values and estimated uncertainties. All our numerical results\nare based on the predictions of the SSM of Bahcall and Pinsonneault from 2004 [13]. These include\nthe dependence of different solar neutrino fluxes (8 B , 7 Be , pp) on the SSM input parameters, and,\nwhenever necessary, the predicted values of the SSM input parameters and their uncertainties.\nWe used first the precise value of the 8 B neutrino flux, \u03c6B , obtained from global analysis\nof solar neutrino and KamLAND data, to determine each of the SSM parameters on which \u03c6B\ndepends. If the measured mean value of \u03c6B differs from the value predicted by the SSM, \u03c6SSM\n, the\nB\nvalue of the parameter xj1 obtained using the data on \u03c6B would differ from its SSM predicted value\nln \u03c6B\nx0j1 by a factor controlled by the logarithmic derivative \u03b1B,j1 = \u2202\u2202 ln\n(see eq. (25)). The relative\nxj1\nuncertainty in the parameter xj1 thus found depends on the inverse power of the magnitude of \u03b1B,j1\n(eq. (26)). Since, according to the BP04 SSM, the relevant logarithmic derivatives in the cases\nof the nuclear reaction S-factors S33 and S1,14 are relatively small (see Table 2), these quantities\ncannot be determined with sufficiently good accuracy even by using a high precision measurement\nof the 8 B neutrino flux. The results of this part of our analysis are summarised in Table 3. We have\nfound, in particular, that the SSM parameters like S11 , Z/X, L\u2299 and O\u2299 can be determined with\nuncertainties less than 10% owing to the relatively large values of their corresponding logarithmic\nderivatives. For the uncertainty in diffusion parameter D\u2299 we get approximately 10.6%. Our\nresults show that the parameter Z/X can be determined with an uncertainty which is smaller\nthan its currently estimated uncertainty in the BP04 SSM [13]. We have found also that the\nuncertainties of most of the SSM parameters under discussion practically do not change when the\n\n21\n\n\f1\u03c3 error in the measured 8 B neutrino flux is reduced from 4% to 2%.\nWe have performed a similar analysis by combining a prospective high precision measurement\nof the 7 Be neutrino flux with the 8 B neutrino flux measurement. In this case it is possible to\ndetermine simultaneously two SSM input parameters, xj1 and xj2 , including their uncertainties,\nusing the data on the 8 B and 7 Be neutrino fluxes. Our results show, in particular, that the values\nof the parameters xj1 and xj2 thus determined could differ from their respective SSM values by\nfactors determined by the four logarithmic derivatives - \u03b1B,j1 , \u03b1B,j2 , \u03b1Be,j1 and \u03b1Be,j2 (eqs. (27) and\n(28)). We have calculated the SSM parameter uncertainties for all possible combinations of two\nSSM parameters {xj1 ,xj2 }, assuming that 8 B and 7 Be neutrino fluxes are measured with 1\u03c3 errors\nof 4% and 6%, respectively. Such precision on \u03c6Be can be reached in the Borexino experiment.\nWe have found that the uncertainties of xj1 and xj2 are controlled in a rather complicated way by\nboth the magnitude and the relative signs of the different logarithmic derivatives (eqs. (29) and\n(30)). If for a certain pair of SSM parameters xj1 and xj2 the relation \u03b1B,j2 /\u03b1B,j1 \u223c\n= \u03b1Be,j2 /\u03b1Be,j1\nholds, these parameters would be determined with poor accuracy even if one uses high precision\ndata on the 8 B and 7 Be neutrino fluxes. The logarithmic derivatives taken from the BP04 SSM\n(table 2) suggest that such pairs can be, for instance, {S33 , S34 }, {L\u2299 , O\u2299 } and {Z/X, D\u2299 }. We\nhave found also that among the solar physics parameters the opacity O\u2299 can be determined with\na 9% uncertainty in pair with S34 , or S17 , or Se\u2212 7 , for which we get at the same time uncertainty\nof approximately 16%. For the diffusion D\u2299 we find an uncertainty of 11% when determined in\ncombination with S33 or S34 . In these cases the latter are found with uncertainties of 36% and\n14%, respectively. Most of the results from this part of our study are summarised in Table 4.\nWe have obtained also rather detailed results on the uncertainties of the combination {Z/X,S34 },\ndetermined from data on the 8 B and 7 Be neutrino fluxes (Table 5 and Fig. 3). We have found, in\nparticular, that if the 1\u03c3 uncertainties in the values of \u03c6B and \u03c6Be are smaller than 4%, the uncertainty in the value of S34 , determined using the neutrino flux measurements, would be smaller\nthan its presently estimated uncertainty of \u223c 9% . The uncertainty in the determination of Z/X\nwould be smaller than its currently SSM estimated one of 15% if \u03c6Be is measured with an error\nnot exceeding approximately 10% at 1\u03c3.\nFinally, we have analyzed the possibility to use high precision prospective measurements of the\n8\nB , 7 Be and pp solar neutrino fluxes to simultaneously determine any three of the SSM input\nparameters. We have taken different combinations of three SSM parameters and calculate their\nuncertainties using 3%, 4% and 1% as illustrative 1\u03c3 errors in the measured values of \u03c6B , \u03c6Be\nand \u03c6pp , respectively. We have found that for almost all solar model parameters, the uncertainties\nreduce when using the combined information on the 7 B, 8 Be and pp neutrino fluxes, compared\nto what we have obtained by using only prospective data on 8 B and/or 7 Be fluxes. Results\nfor those sets of three SSM input parameters which are determined with uncertainties smaller\nthan 15% each are collected in Table 6. Our results show, in particular, that the most precise\ndetermination of S34 occurs in the combination {S34 , L\u2299 , Se\u2212 7 }, while Z/X is best determined in\nthe set {S17 , L\u2299 , Z/X}. For both these parameters the uncertainties we get are smaller than those\nin the respective BP04 SSM predictions. The best determination of S11 is found to be from the\nset {S11 , , L\u2299 , Se\u2212 7 }, of D\u2299 from {S17 , L\u2299 , D\u2299 }, and of \u03c4\u2299 from {S17 , L\u2299 , \u03c4\u2299 }. Even though the\nprecision we obtained for L\u2299 is worse than the precision achieved in the direct measurement of\nL\u2299 , the method used to determine L\u2299 allows to perform a fundamental test of the thermo-nuclear\n22\n\n\ffusion theory of energy generation in the Sun, as well as to test the hypothesis that the Sun is\nin an approximate steady state in what regards the energy produced in its central region and the\nenergy emitted from its surface.\nThe results obtained in the present article underline the importance of performing high precision measurements of 7 Be and pp solar neutrino fluxes.\nAcknowledgments.
