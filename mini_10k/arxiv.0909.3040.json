Their strengths [the spectroscopic factors\n(SFs)] and energies are essential inputs in large-scale shellmodel (SM) calculations, which provide the most successful description of medium mass 0s1d and 0p1 f nuclei [1].\nSingle-particle wave functions and SFs also enter the nuclear\nmatrix elements that describe nucleon capture and emission in\nstellar burning processes [2].\nThe need for understanding quasiparticles has become\nmore compelling in recent years due to the realization that\ntheir energies evolve, with changing proton or neutron number, due to the nuclear tensor force [3, 4]. The quenchings of\nabsolute spectroscopic factors (SFs) have also been observed\nto change dramatically at the driplines [5, 6]. These effects\ncause the breakdown of conventional magic numbers far from\nthe valley of stability and can give rise to new exotic modes\nof excitation. In order to predict the properties of nuclei at the\nlimits of stability, it is imperative to derive robust models for\nquasiparticle properties. Recently it has been suggested that\nrelative SFs among small quasiparticle fragments can be described within the SM approach [7]. This Letter discusses the\nproblem of the absolute quenching of SFs and shows that this\nrequires accounting for coupling to collective resonances and\nlarge model spaces, beyond the capability of the SM.\nThe reactions for transfer of a nucleon to/from the initial\nstate |\u03a80A i depend on the overlap wave function [8, 9]\n\u03c8\u03b1A\u00b11 (r) = h\u03a8\u03b1A\u00b11 |\u03c8(\u2020) (r)|\u03a80A i ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b1 can label either particle or hole states. SFs are identified with the normalization integral of \u03c8\u03b1A\u00b11 (r) and give a\n\"measure\" of what fraction of the final wave function, |\u03a8\u03b1A\u00b11 i,\ncan be factorized into a (correlated) core plus an independent\nparticle or hole. Strong deviations from the independent particle model (IPM)-that is, a Slater determinant with fully occupied orbits-signal substantial correlations and imply the\nonset of non trivial many-body dynamics. For stable nuclei,\na large body of data has been accumulated from (e,e\u2032 p) experiments. These studies showed that proton absolute SFs for\nisotopes all across the nuclear chart are uniformly quenched\nto 60-70% of the IPM value [10, 11]. Short-range correlations\n\n(SRC)-originating from the repulsion of the nuclear force at\nshort distances-have been investigated as a possible cause.\nHowever, they explain only a small fraction of the observed\nreduction [12, 13], as confirmed by recent experiments at Jefferson Laboratory [14, 15]. Thus, one is left to understand the\nrole long-range correlations (LRC) effects (see, for example,\nRefs. [16, 17] and references therein).\nSuccessful ab-initio calculations have been reported for\nlight nuclei using the variational Monte Carlo method [18].\nFor larger masses, self-consistent (SC) Green's function\n(GF) theory [16, 19] gave encouraging results for 48 Ca and\n90\nZr [20]. However, these early calculations focused only on\none particular type of correlations [either coupling to particlehole (ph) or particle-particle and hole-hole phonons]. Recently, we have improved the SCGF method [21] to include\ncorrelations from the remaining collective modes, extended\nit to large-scale no-core calculations up 56 Ni, and based our\nstudies on realistic nuclear forces [22, 23]. Thus, we are now\nin the position of making accurate studies of the effects of correlations. In addition, the SCGF equations describe directly\nthe interactions among quasiparticle states, which allows extracting single-particle orbits and effective interactions for the\nSM. This Letter applies these new capabilities to study in detail quasiparticle states in 56 Ni and 48 Ca and to extract an effective Hamiltonian for 0s1d and 0p1 f orbits in the SM. The\nSCGF results will then be compared to the SM ones to investigate the role of all different types of correlations on the\nquenching of SF.\nFormalism.- The calculations were performed in a large\nmodel space including of up to 10 major harmonic oscillator\nshells. All details are reported in Ref. [23] and here we give\nan overview of the points needed for the present discussion.\nSpectroscopic factors were extracted from the one-body propagator (spin/isospin indices are omitted for simplicity) [19],\n\u0010\n\u0011\u2217\nX \u03c8nA+1 (r) \u03c8nA+1 (r\u2032 )\ng(r, r\u2032 ; \u03c9) =\n\u03c9 \u2212 (EnA+1 \u2212 E0A ) + i\u03b7\nn\n\u0010\n\u0011\u2217\nX \u03c8kA\u22121 (r) \u03c8kA\u22121 (r\u2032 )\n,\n(2)\n+\n\u03c9 + (EkA\u22121 \u2212 E0A ) \u2212 i\u03b7\nk\nwhere the residues are the overlap amplitudes (1) and the\n\n\f2\n\n\u03a0\n\n(ph)\n\n\u03a0\n\n(ph)\n\ng II\n\n(pp/hh)\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Left.

Arrows up (down) refer to quasiparticle\n(quasihole) states, the \u03a0(ph) propagators include collective ph and charge-exchange resonances, and the gII include pairing between two\nparticles or two holes. The FRPA method sums analogous diagrams, with any numbers of phonons, to all orders [21, 25]. Right. Singleparticle spectral distribution for neutrons in 56 Ni, obtained from FRPA. Energies above (below) EF are for transitions to excited states of\n57\nNi (55 Ni). The quasiparticle states close to the Fermi surface are clearly visible. Integrating over r [Eq. (4)] gives the SFs reported in Tab. I.\n\npoles give the experimental energy transfer for nucleon pickup\n(knockout) to the excited states of the systems with A+1 (A-1)\nparticles. The propagator (2) is obtained by solving the Dyson\nequation [g(\u03c9) = g(0) (\u03c9) + g(0) (\u03c9) \u03a3\u22c6 (\u03c9) g(\u03c9)], where\ng(0) (\u03c9) propagates a free nucleon. The information on nuclear\nstructure is included in the irreducible self-energy, which was\nsplit into two contributions:\n\u03a3\u22c6 (r, r\u2032 ; \u03c9) = \u03a3 MF (r, r\u2032 ; \u03c9) + \u03a3\u0303(r, r\u2032 ; \u03c9) .\n\n(3)\n\nThe term \u03a3 MF (\u03c9) includes both the nuclear mean field (MF)\nand diagrams describing two-particle scattering outside the\nmodel space, generated using a G-matrix resummation [24].\nAs a consequence, it acquires an energy dependence which\nis induced by SRC among nucleons [23]. The second term,\n\u03a3\u0303(\u03c9), includes the LRC. In the present work, \u03a3\u0303(\u03c9) is calculated in the so-called Faddeev random phase approximation\n(FRPA) of Refs. [21, 25]. This includes diagrams for particlevibration coupling at all orders and with all possible vibration\nmodes, see Fig. 1, as well as low-energy 2p1h/2h1p configurations. Particle-vibration couplings play an important role in\ncompressing the single-particle spectrum at the Fermi energy\nto its experimental density. However, a complete configuration mixing of states around the Fermi surface is still missing\nand would require SM calculations.\nEach spectroscopic amplitude \u03c8A\u00b11 (r) appearing in Eq. (2)\nhas to be normalized to its respective SF as\nZ\u03b1 =\n\nZ\n\ndr |\u03c8\u03b1A\u00b11 (r)|2 =\n\n1\n1\u2212\n\n\u2202\u03a3\u22c6\u03b1\u0302\u03b1\u0302 (\u03c9)\n\u2202\u03c9\n\u03c9=\u00b1(E\u03b1A\u00b11 \u2212E0A )\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03a3\u03b1\u0302\u22c6\u03b1\u0302 (\u03c9) \u2261< \u03c8\u0302\u03b1 |\u03a3\u22c6 (\u03c9)|\u03c8\u0302\u03b1 > is the matrix element of\nthe self-energy calculated\nfor the overlap function itself but\nR\nnormalized to unity ( dr |\u03c8\u0302\u03b1 (r)|2 = 1). By inserting Eq. (3)\ninto (4), one distinguishes two contributions to the quenching\nof SFs. For model spaces sufficiently large, all low-energy\nphysics is described by \u03a3\u0303(\u03c9). Then, the derivative of \u03a3 MF (\u03c9)\n\naccounts for the coupling to states outside the model space\nand estimates the effects of SRC alone [33].\nIn general, the SC self-energy (3) is a functional of the onebody propagator itself, \u03a3\u22c6 = \u03a3\u22c6 [g]. Hence the FRPA equations for the self-energy and the Dyson equation have to be\nsolved iteratively. The mean-field part, \u03a3 MF [g], was calculated exactly in terms of the fully fragmented propagator (2).\nFor the FRPA, this procedure was simplified by employing the\n\u03a3\u0303[gIPM ] obtained in terms of a MF-like propagator\nX (\u03c6n (r))\u2217 \u03c6n (r\u2032 )\nX \u03c6k (r) (\u03c6k (r\u2032 ))\u2217\n+\n,\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u03b5nIMP + i\u03b7\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u03b5kIMP \u2212 i\u03b7\nn\u2208\n/F\nk\u2208F\n(5)\nwhich is updated at each iteration to approximate Eq. (2) with\na limited number of poles. Eq. (5) defines a set of undressed\nsingle-particle states that can be taken as a basis for SM applications. This feature will be used below to estimate the importance of configuration mixing effects on the quenching of\nspectroscopic factors. The present calculations employed the\nN3LO interaction from chiral perturbation theory [26] with a\nmodification of the tensor monopoles to correct for missing\nthree-nucleon interactions [27].\nResults.- The calculated single-particle spectral function\n[S 56 Ni (r, \u03c9) = \u03c01 |g(r = r\u2032 ; \u03c9)|2 ] is shown in Fig. 1 for the case\nof neutron transfer on 56 Ni. This picture puts in evidence the\nquasiparticle and quasihole states associated with valence orbits in the 0p1 f shell. The corresponding SFs are reported\nin Tab. I, including both protons and neutrons. The first column is obtained by including only the derivative of \u03a3 MF (\u03c9)\nwhen calculating Eq. (4). Since N3LO is rather soft compared to other realistic interactions the effect of SRC is relatively small. From other models one could expect a quenching\nup to about 10% [16], as confirmed by recent electron scattering experiments [14, 15, 28]. This difference would not affect\nsensibly the conclusions below. The complete FRPA result for\nSFs is given in the second column. For the transition between\nthe 56 Ni and 57 Ni ground states, our result agrees with knock-\n\ngIPM (r, r\u2032 ; \u03c9) =\n\n\f3\nout reactions with fast beams within the given error bar [29].\nNote that 56 Ni is close to the stability line, where the analysis\nof these reactions has been tested against electron scattering\nresults. The remaining orbits have similar quenchings and are\nin line with results expected for stable nuclei [10]. This shows\nthat the dominant mechanism in reducing the spectroscopic\nstrength is to be looked for in LRC involving configurations\namong several shells around the Fermi surface.\nWe now turn to the question of what are the relevant lowenergy degrees of freedom and the importance of configurations with multiple ph excitations. Excitations beyond\n2p1h and 2h1p are partially included by the SC-FRPA, from\nwhich one can expect an accurate description of quasiparticles around shell closures. This was checked by comparing\nSC-FRPA and large-scale SM calculations in the 1p0 f shell.\nThe basis and the interaction were constructed using the \"undressed\" single-particle orbits \u03c6\u03b1 (r), defined by Eq. (5), and\nthe same G-matrix interaction used in the full-space FRPA\ncalculations. Shell-model calculations used the ANTOINE\ncode [1, 30] and included up to 6p6h excitations for the A=57\nsystems and up to 8p8h for A=55. The resulting SFs are\nshown in the last three columns of Tab. I. As an example, the\nquenching for the p3/2 ground state of 57 Ni, is predicted to be\n0.82 by FRPA and 0.79 by the SM. Comparing with the fullspace result of 0.65, one infers that about half of the quenching is driven by degrees of freedom from outside the 1p0 f\nspace. In particular, giant resonances originating from 1~\u03c9\nand 2~\u03c9 excitations carry enough collectivity to influence the\nquenching of orbits close to the Fermi surface. The difference\nbetween SM and FRPA in the 0p1 f space is \u2206Z\u03b1 =0.79-0.82=0.03, which is smaller than the typical model dependence of\nSFs extracted from experiments. One can treat the \u2206Z\u03b1 s as\nsmall perturbations and add them to the full-space FRPA results, leading to our final predictions for absolute SFs (third\ncolumn of Tab. I). Relative SFs with respect the other states\nin 57 Ni have been studied by re-analyzing the world (d,p)\ndata [7]. These results agree with the SM and, hence, with\nFRPA ones (see Tab. I). However, the model dependence of\nthis analysis appears too large to constrain absolute values of\nSFs.\nTable II reports the results of the same analysis for 48 Ca.\nAlso in this case, degrees of freedom from outside the first\n10 oscillator shells have a small effect, of 3-6%, on the absolute SFs. The SC-FRPA coupling to collective modes reduces\nthese to about 80% of the IPM, and even lower for proton\nholes to 47 K. The SM calculations employed the \"undressed\"\nsingle-particle orbits (5) generated by the large space SCFRPA for this nucleus. We adopted a model space (which will\nbe named sd3 p f ) consisting of the (1s1/2 ,0d3/2 ,1p3/2 ,0 f7/2 )\norbits for protons and of (1p1/2 ,1p3/2 ,0 f5/2 ,0 f7/2 ) for neutrons.\nThis can be handled by present day computers with up to\n10p10h configurations and includes the most important excitations across the Fermi surface. The SM results in the sd3 p f\nmodel space do not give additional quenchings for the valence\norbits in the 1p0 f shell. Hence, multiple ph configurations\nare suppressed even more than for the 56 Ni case. Note that\n\n10 osc. shells\nExp.

For the SC-FRPA calculation in the large\nharmonic oscillator space, the values shown are obtained by including only SRC, SRC and LRC from particle-vibration couplings (full\nFRPA), and by SRC, particle-vibration couplings and extra correlations due to configuration mixing (FRPA+\u2206Z\u03b1 ). The last three\ncolumns give the results of SC-FRPA and SM in the restricted 1p0 f\nmodel space. The \u2206Z\u03b1 are the differences between the last two results and are taken as corrections for the SM correlations that are not\nalready included in the FRPA formalism.\n\nthe \u03bd0 f5/2 quasiparticle in 49 Ca splits in two main fragments\nbut their total strength remains unchanged. Experimental SFs\nfor the ground (\u03bd0p3/2 ) and first excited (\u03bd0p1/2 ) states, have\nbeen extracted from a combined analysis of (d,p) and (n,\u03b3)\nreactions [31].\nProton-hole states in 47 K are a case in which SM correlations start becoming important. The FRPA in the sd3 p f space\ndescribes about a half of the quenching of the 0d3/2 orbits\nin the full space. The SM calculations induce a further reduction of \u22488%. Adding this estimate brings the 0d3/2 SF\nto 0.59, in agreement within the experimental (e,e\u2032 p) value\nof 0.56(5) [11]. Shell-model correlations are even more substantial for the 1s1/2 fragments: here the sd3 p f space is sufficient to reproduce almost all of the quenching obtained in the\nlargest space. Configurations not included in the FRPA are\nalso more important and induce a further reduction of up to\n16% for the ground state of 47 K. The total predicted strength\nof the two 1s1/2 peaks is 0.50, somewhat lower that the (e,e\u2032 p)\nvalue of 0.61(5).\nUtsuno and collaborators have also calculated the spectral\nstrength for proton removal from 48 Ca and found that the spinorbit spitting between the 0d states and the ordering of singleparticle energies are sensitive to the tensor force [32]. These\ncalculations also show that the fragmentation pattern in 47 K\nis well reproduced by the SM, as suggested in [7]. The experimental strength is however lower by an overall factor of\n\u22480.73.

The present work does not support the assumption that\nthe uniform quenching observed in stable nuclei originates\nfrom a unique mechanism such as short-range correlations.\nSRC have been predicted [12, 16] and experimentally confirmed [14, 15] to influence just a small fraction of the total strength. We find that spectroscopic factors for valence\norbits result from a combination of configuration mixing at\nthe Fermi surface and coupling to collective resonances. The\nformer can usually describe the relative spectroscopic factors\n(hence, the fragmentation pattern at low energy) and it will\nbe crucial in open shell nuclei. On the other hand, the overall quenching of absolute spectroscopic factors requires both\nthe coupling to collective modes at higher energies and large\nmodel spaces that cannot be approached by shell-model calculations. This work reported on the first consistent calculation\nof all these effects in the medium-mass region and used the\nsame realistic interaction.\nIt was also found that quasiparticles around shell closures\ncan be described accurately by self-consistent Green's function theory in the FRPA approximation.
