Several different scenarios have been proposed, some based on stellar dynamics, others on gas\nhydrodynamics, and still others that combine these processes. There are three major routes to form a SMBH.\nOne possibility is that the gas in the newly-forming\ngalaxy does not break up into stellar-mass condensations,\nbut instead forms a single superstar, and then undergoes\ncomplete gravitational collapse. Another possibility is\nthat instead of forming a single superstar, black holes\n(BHs) might grow from smaller seeds, and then merge to\nform a SMBH. The final possibility is the runaway growth\nof a stellar mass BH to a SMBH by accretion. Here we\nconsider the possibility of forming a SMBH from the collapse of a supermassive star (SMS).\nThere are two categories of collapsing rotating SMSs\nbased on their angular momentum distribution. One is\nthe collapse of a uniformly rotating SMS. This happens\nwhen momentum transport is large, either through viscous turbulence or magnetic processes, which drives the\nstar to rotate uniformly. In this case the path to the\nSMBH is the following. First the SMS contracts until the\nmass shedding limit is reached, conserving the angular\nmomentum of the star. If the SMS contains sufficient angular momentum, the star evolves quasi-stationary along\nthe mass-shedding limit, releasing the mass and angular\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: saijo@rikkyo.ac.jp\naddress: I.Hawke@soton.ac.uk\n\nmomentum. When the star reaches the post-Newtonian\ninstability it begins to collapse. Baumgarte and Shapiro\n[2] found that the star starts to collapse from the universal configuration when the system contains sufficient\nangular momentum, independent of the history of the\nstar. Saijo et al. [3] found that the collapse is coherent.\nThat is, no significant bar instability occurs before BH\nformation in three dimensional post-Newtonian simulations. Shibata and Shapiro [4] found that a final Kerr BH\nof a/M \u2248 0.75 contains 90% of the total rest-mass of the\nsystem, and that the disk around the BH contains 10% of\nthat in an axisymmetric general relativistic simulation.\nThe other category of collapsing rotating SMSs are differentially rotating. This happens when the viscous and\nthe magnetic effects are small, which allows the star to rotate differentially. One of the representative scenarios for\nforming a differentially rotating star is as follows. First,\na gas cloud gathers in an almost spherical configuration\nwith some amount of angular momentum in the system.\nNext the almost spherical star contracts, conserving specific angular momentum due to the lack of viscosity, to\nform a differentially rotating star, and possibly a disk at\nthe end of the contraction [5].\nDuring the contraction of the differentially rotating\nSMS, prior to forming a supermassive disk, two possible instabilities may arise that terminate the contraction. One is the post-Newtonian gravitational instability,\nwhich leads the star to collapse dynamically. The other\nis the dynamical bar mode instability, which changes the\nangular momentum distribution of the star to form a bar,\nand possibly leads to the central core of the star collapsing to a BH due to the angular momentum loss.\nOne of the primary observational missions for spacebased detection of gravitational waves is the investigation\nof supermassive objects [6]. Since the Laser Interferome-\n\n\f2\n10\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n\u03c1max\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10 0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\nt/M\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\nFIG. 1: Maximum of the rest mass density as a function\nof time. Solid, dashed, dotted, and dash-dotted lines denote\nmodels I, II, III, IV, respectively.\n\nter Space Antenna (LISA) will have long arms (106 km),\nthe detector will be most sensitive in the low frequency\nband (10\u22124 \u223c 10\u22121 Hz). Potential sources of high signal to noise events in this frequency range include quasiperiodic waves arising from nonaxisymmetric bars in collapsing SMSs and the inspiral of binary SMBHs (e.g.\nRef. [7]). In addition, the nonspherical collapse of rotating SMSs to SMBHs could be a significant source of\nburst and quasi-normal gravitational waves (e.g. Ref. [8]).\nIn this paper we track the collapse of a SMS by numerical\nsimulation to investigate some of these possibilities.\nHere we focus on the post-Newtonian gravitational instability in differentially rotating SMSs. The aim of this\nwork is to understand the final fate of the collapse of\ndifferentially rotating SMSs. There are two studies that\naddress this issue. New and Shapiro [9] studied the \"zeroviscosity\" equilibrium sequence in differentially rotating\nSMSs in Newtonian gravity. They showed that the star\nreaches the bifurcation point of dynamical bar instability\nbefore the disk forms by contraction. Saijo [10] studied\nthe gravitational collapse of differentially rotating SMSs\nin the conformally flat approximation of general relativity near the onset of radial instability. He showed that\nonce the star collapses, the collapse is coherent and may\nform a SMBH with no substantial nonaxisymmetric deformation due to instability. However the previous work\nmay contain less angular momentum so that there might\nbe no significant difference between the cases of uniform\nrotation and differential rotation. Therefore we now focus on the case where the angular momentum is more\ncontained in the star than the previous case, which potentially leads to rotational instabilities if they occur.\nIn particular, we plan to answer the following questions.\nDoes the BH form coherently? What are the features\nof the dynamics? Does the newly formed disk lead to\ninstabilities? Can this system act as an efficient source\nof gravitational waves (GWs)? In order to answer these\n\nquestions, three dimensional general relativistic hydrodynamics are desirable.\nThe content of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II,\nwe briefly explain the general relativistic hydrodynamics, especially the numerical tools we used to simulate\nthe violent phenomena. In Sec. III, we introduce our\nfindings of dynamical BHs, disk formation, and gravitational waves. Section IV is devoted to the summary\nof this paper. Throughout this paper, we use the geometrized units with G = c = 1 and adopt Cartesian\ncoordinates (x, y, z) with the coordinate time t. Note\nthat Greek index takes (t, x, y, z), while Latin one takes\n(x, y, z).\n\nII.\n\nBASIC EQUATIONS\n\nIn this section, we briefly describe the threedimensional relativistic hydrodynamics in full general relativity.\n\nA.\n\nThe gravitational field equations\n\nWe define the spatial projection tensor h\u03bc\u03bd \u2261 g \u03bc\u03bd +\nn n , where g \u03bc\u03bd is the spacetime metric, n\u03bc =\n(1/\u03b1, \u2212\u03b2 i /\u03b1) the unit normal to a spatial hypersurface,\nand where \u03b1 and \u03b2 i are the lapse and shift.

If it is the outermost trapped surface, which is\nexpected to be the case with all those considered here,\nthen it is an apparent horizon. An angular momentum\nof the horizon JBH can be written (see e.g. section III.B\nof Ref. [20]) as\nZ\n1\nK\u03bc\u03bd R\u03bc \u03c6\u03bd ds,\n(2.24)\nJBH = \u2212\n8\u03c0 SR\nwhere R\u03bc is the outward directed spacelike normal to the\nhorizon within the spacelike slice, and \u03c6a is a rotational\nvector field on the horizon. This can be interpreted as\nthe Komar angular momentum when \u03c6a is a rotational\nKilling vector on the horizon. The code and method used\nto compute numerically an approximate Killing vector,\nshould it exist, is described in Ref. [21].\n\nNote that Rs is the area radius of the hole. We also\nmonitor the dimensionless Kerr parameter (J/M 2 )BH\nthroughout the evolution.\nD.\n\nGravitational waveform\n\nIn order to monitor gravitational waves, we use the\nNewman-Penrose-Weyl scalar \u03a84\n\u03a84 = C\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c3 k \u03bc m\u0304\u03bd k \u03bb m\u0304\u03c3 ,\n\n(2.26)\n\nwhere C\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c3 is the Weyl tensor, k \u03bc the ingoing null vector, m\u03bc and m\u0304\u03bc are the orthogonal spatial-null vectors\nof the four complex null tetrad (l\u03bc , k \u03bc , m\u03bc , m\u0304\u03bc ). More\nprecisely, a set of null vectors are defined by introducing\na orthonormal tetrad e\u03bc(a) as\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\nl\u03bc = \u221a e\u03bc(0) + e\u03bc(1) ,\n2\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\nk \u03bc = \u221a e\u03bc(0) \u2212 e\u03bc(1) ,\n2\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\nm\u03bc = \u221a e\u03bc(2) + ie\u03bc(3) ,\n2\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 \u03bc\n\u03bc\nm\u0304 = \u221a e(2) \u2212 ie\u03bc(3) .\n2\n\n(2.27)\n(2.28)\n(2.29)\n(2.30)\n\nNote that we choose the vector e\u03bc(0) as the unit normal\nto the spatial hypersurface, e\u03bc(1) the unit radial vector in\nspherical coordinates, and (e\u03bc(2) , e\u03bc(3) ) the unit vectors in\nthe angular directions. The Weyl scalar \u03a84 represents\nthe outgoing gravitational waves at infinity\n\u03a84 = \u1e27+ \u2212 i\u1e27\u00d7 ,\n\n(2.31)\n\n\f6\nwhere h+ and h\u00d7 are the two polarization modes\n(transverse-traceless condition) of the perturbed metric\nfrom flat spacetime in spherical coordinate and q\u0307 represents the time derivative of the quantity q. If we put the\nobserver sufficiently far from the source, the Weyl scalar\n\u03a84 roughly represents the outgoing gravitational waves,\nignoring the radiation back scattered by the curvature.\nTherefore we monitor the Weyl scalar \u03a84 to understand\nkey features of the gravitational waves emitted by this\nsystem.\n\nfor the collapsing stars. As in previous works we use\na reconstruction-evolution method to evolve the matter,\nwith PPM reconstruction [17] of the matter variables and\nMarquina's formula [18] to compute the inter-cell fluxes.\nThird order Runge-Kutta evolution in time is also used\nin our computation.\n\nIII.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\nA.\n\nE.\n\nTreatment of the spacetime singularity from the\nnewly formed black hole\n\nWhen a horizon is found in the simulation some of\nthe matter within the horizon is excised from the domain using the technique of Ref. [22]. The domain excised is a sphere with coordinate radius half the minimum coordinate radius of the horizon at the time of\nexcision. It is allowed to grow during evolution but not\nto shrink (in coordinate radius). Although the spacetime\nis not excised, we introduce a strong artificial dissipation\nterm in Eqs. (2.4) \u2013 (2.11), combined with the standard\ngauge conditions, to avoid problems with the singularity\n[23]. In practice, we add a dissipation term \u2212\u01ebdxi \u2202i4 q in\nEqs. (2.4) \u2013 (2.11), where q is the quantity evolved by the\nparticular evolution equation. We specify the dissipation\nparameter \u01eb \u2248 0.2 for our simulation.\nIn addition to this dissipation term, we have found it\nnecessary to stabilize our evolutions in certain circumstances by reducing the timestep on individual refinement levels. This is particularly true for the finest levels\nnear the horizon where low density matter is orbiting at\nextreme speed.\n\nWe construct the four differentially rotating SMSs for\nevolution. We use the polytropic equation of state of\nEq. (2.14) with n = 3, which represents the radiation\npressure dominant, SMS sequence, and the relativistic\n\"j-constant\" rotation law as\nut u\u03c6 = A2 (\u03a9c \u2212 \u03a9),\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere A(\u2261 Re \u00c2) represents the degree of differential\nrotation and has the dimension of length, \u03a9c the central angular velocity, and \u03a9 the angular velocity. We\nchoose \u00c2 = 0.3 here. In the Newtonian limit (ut \u2192 1,\nu\u03c6 \u2192 \u031f2 \u03a9 where \u031f is the cylindrical radius of the star),\nthis rotation law becomes\n\u03a9=\n\nA2 \u03a9c\n.\n\u031f2 + A2\n\n(3.2)\n\nWe use the technique of Ref. [28] to construct the rotating equilibrium stars. Our four differentially rotating\nequilibrium stars that will be evolved using the full \u0393-law\nequation of state of Eq. (2.13) are summarised in Table I.\n\nB.\nF.\n\nEquilibrium Stars\n\nDisk Mass from Equilibrium Configuration\n\nComputational codes and techniques\n\nWe perform 3+1 hydrodynamic simulations in general\nrelativity using CACTUS [24] (gravitational physics),\nCARPET [25] (mesh refinement of space and time),\nWHISKY [26] (see Ref. [27] and references therein for a\nrecent description) (general relativistic hydrodynamics).\nWe set the outermost boundary of the computational grid\nfor all direction as xmax = 111 \u2013 131M , imposing plane\nsymmetry across the z = 0 plane, and use 5 \u2013 11 refinement levels to maintain the resolution at the central core\nregion. We set the i-th refinement level of the uniform\ngrid as Li = 27\u2212i \u00d7 10, \u2206ri = 25\u2212i (i = 1, * * * , 11 for collapsing objects), where Li is the outer boundary of the\ngrid, \u2206ri is the stepsize of the spatial grid, respectively.\nThe finest central resolution for the collapsing SMS is\n\u2206x = (3.08 \u2013 3.21) \u00d7 10\u22123 M . The Courant condition\nis set as \u2206t = Ccrt \u2206x, where Ccrt = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 for\nthe finest three refinement levels for collapsing stars and\nCcrt = 0.4 for the rest of the refinement levels, damping\nparameter of the shift condition \u03b7 = 3.91 \u2013 4.05 M \u22121\n\nBefore computing the collapse of the star, we can estimate the final rest mass ratio between BH and its surrounding materials with the technique of Ref. [4]. The\nidea is the following. Suppose a star collapses axisymmetrically throughout the system.

Note that Vcyl is the three dimensional spatial volume along the cylinder.

After the determination of the cylindrical rest mass of the BH, we can\ncompute that of the disk from the total rest mass of the\nsystem. We can also compute the approximate Kerr parameter from the quantities at the maximum.

[10]) and are summarised in Table I.\n\nC.\n\nCollapse of Differentially Rotating\nSupermassive Stars\n\nWe first investigate the onset of collapse by evolving\nthe four differentially rotating equilibrium stars of Table I. We choose the z-axis as the rotational one of the\nequilibrium star. Since we use the polytropic equation of\nstate P = \u03ba\u03c1\u03930 (P : pressure, \u03ba: constant, \u03c10 : rest mass\ndensity, \u0393: adiabatic exponent) when constructing initial\ndata sets, all physical quantities are rescalable in terms of\n\u03ba. Therefore, we represent all physical quantities nondimensionally in this paper, which is equivalent to setting\n\u03ba = 1. To trigger collapse, we deplete pressure by 1%.\nChecking the maximum rest mass density of the rotating\nstars throughout the evolution, we conclude that models\nI and II are radially unstable, while models III and IV\nare stable (Fig. 1).\nSince we use a free evolution scheme for the 17 variables associated with the spacetime, the constraint equations of Einstein's field equations are not automatically\nsatisfied at each timestep. Therefore we can monitor the\nHamiltonian constraint and Momentum constraints as a\ncheck on the accuracy of the simulation. We define them\nas\nHC = R \u2212 K i j K j i + K 2 \u2212 16\u03c0\u03c1H ,\nj\n\nM Ci = \u2207j Ki \u2212 \u2207i K \u2212 8\u03c0Si ,\n\n(3.6)\n(3.7)\n\nand show them for models I and II in Fig. 2. Since these\nquantities should be exactly zero sense, we normalise the\nHamiltonian constraintpby 16\u03c0\u03c1max and the Momentum\nconstraints by 8\u03c0\u03c1max M/R, where \u03c1max is the maximum rest mass density at each timestep. Both of the\nnormalisation quantities represent the typical size of the\nsource term of the constraints (maximum rest-mass density and collapsing momentum density). Since all constraint quantities are conserved within \u22481% from Fig. 2,\nthe constraints seem to be satisfied at a reasonable level\nthroughout the evolution.\nWe also monitor the rest mass M0 , ADM mass Madm ,\nand the total angular momentum J\nZ\n\u221a\nM0 =\ndv\u03c1ut \u2212g,\nI\n1\n\u2207i \u03c8dSi\nMadm = \u2212\n2\u03c0 \u221e\nZ\n1 5\u03c6\ne Aij Aij ],\n=\n[(\u03c1hW 2 \u2212 P )e5\u03c6 +\n16\u03c0\nI\n1\nJ =\n(x\u00c3yj \u2212 y \u00c3xj )e6\u03c6 dS j\n8\u03c0 \u221e\nZ\n1\n(\u00c3x \u2212 \u00c3yx )\n=\ndve6\u03c6 [xSy \u2212 ySx +\n8\u03c0 y\n1\n\u2212\n\u00c3ij (x\u2202y \u2212 y\u2202x )\u03b3 \u0303ij\n16\u03c0\n1\n(x\u2202y \u2212 y\u2202x )Kkk ],\n+\n12\u03c0\nthroughout the evolution in Fig. 3. We only monitor\nthese three quantities until the time when the apparent horizon forms, since our excision method significantly\ncomplicates the computation of the required volume integrals after horizon formation. From Fig. 3, M0 is conserved to within 0.5%, Madm to within 1%, and J to\nwithin 2%. Therefore, we can conclude that all three\nquantities are satisfactory conserved for our case.\nWe also monitor the centre of mass condition in Fig. 4.\nIn practise we monitor\nR (half)\ndv\n\u03c1x\nMx =\n,\n(3.8)\n(half)\nM0\nR (half)\ndv\n\u03c1y\nMy =\n,\n(3.9)\n(half)\nM0\n(half)\n\nwhere M0\nis the rest mass of z \u2265 0, dv (half) the spatial\nvolume of z \u2265 0, since we adopt planar symmetry across\nz = 0. Since our finest spatial gridsize is \u2248 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 M ,\nthe centre of mass motion is contained within a few finest\ngrids cells from the origin. Therefore, we can conclude\nthat centre of mass condition is satisfied for our case.\nWe show contours of the rest mass density in Figs. 5\n(equatorial plane) and 6 (meridional plane) for model I\nand in Figs. 7 (equatorial plane) and 8 (meridional plane)\nfor model II.

Note that the apparent horizon exists after t = 770M , and the coordinate radius of the apparent\nhorizon in the equatorial plane are rhrz = (c) 0.170M and (d) 0.175M , respectively.\n\nBH. After that, there is a significant amount of mass ejection due to the large amount of angular momentum of the\nhole. It is indeed like a flare. Finally the system settles\ndown to a quasi-stationary state; central BH with a disk.\nFluid elements in the equilibrium star are balanced by its\nself gravity, the pressure gradient and centrifugal force.\nWhen the BH forms, some fluid elements act as a particle which is free from the interaction. In this case, the\nmaterial can spread out to a larger radius than the equilibrium radius of the star. Note that there seem to have\nm = 4 structure in the snapshots of I (b) (c) (Fig. 5) and\nII (c) (Fig. 7). We believe that this is due to the reduced\nspatial computational resolution of the outer regions of\nthe star (See Ref. [10] for a different resolution case).\nNext we trace the mass and the angular momentum of\nthe newly formed BH throughout the evolution using the\ndynamical horizon techniques outlined in Sec. II C. We\n\nmonitor the gravitational mass, total angular momentum\nand the Kerr parameter of the newly formed BH throughout the evolution as shown in Fig. 9. The BH mass, the\nspin and the Kerr parameter increase monotonically after\nthe BH has formed, by swallowing much of the surrounding material. This stage lasts roughly until all of the\nmatter located inside the radius of the innermost stable\ncircular orbit of the final BH is swallowed.\nWe have also confirmed that the estimated mass and\nspin of the BH from the equilibrium configuration of the\ncollapsing SMS are in good agreement with the results\nfrom the dynamics. Although we calculated the disk\nmass from the equilibrium configuration in conformally\nflat spacetime, there is a little difference in the physical\nquantities between full general relativistic spacetime and\nconformally flat spacetime (see Table I).

Note\nthat we define the rest mass of the disk as the rest mass\noutside the apparent horizon in each timeslice.\nWe furthermore study the formation of a massive disk\nfrom the collapse of differentially rotating SMSs. We\ntrace the rest mass of the disk for models I and II\n(Fig. 10). The rest mass of the disk monotonically decreases once the BH has formed, since the newly formed\nBH grows monotonically by swallowing the surrounding\nmaterials. One noticeable feature in Fig. 10 is that there\nis a plateau at the final stage of model II. This indicates\nthat there is a strong angular momentum barrier that\na fluid fragments are prohibited to fall into a hole. We\nalso illustrate the snapshot of the rest mass density in\nthe meridional plane of model II (Fig. 8 II[d]). The maximum of the rest mass density is located around r \u2248 2M\nin coordinate units.\nWe also monitor the diagnostics of the m = 1 and\nm = 2 Fourier modes throughout the collapse in Figs. 11\nand 12 (for model I) and Figs. 13 and 14 (for model II).\nWe define the diagnostics Cm as\n\n0\n650\n\n0.4\n\nM0\n\nFIG. 8: Same as Fig. 7, but in the meridional plane.\n\n0.2\n0\n650\n\n700\n\n750\n\n800\n\nt/M\n\n850\n\n900\n\n950\n\nFIG. 10: Disk mass as a function of time.

When these nonaxisymmetries appear, they grow rapidly before saturating. From the growth of the coefficients at larger radius,\nshown in Figs. 12 and 14, it seems clear that the nonaxisymmetries are triggered in the interior of the disk\nand propagate outwards.\n\nD.\n\nGravitational radiation\n\nFinally we investigate the gravitational waveform from\nthe collapsing object. We introduce the Weyl scalar \u03a84\nto study the outgoing gravitational waves.

Note that\nthe equatorial coordinate radius of the equilibrium star\nis r = 38.1M and 37.0M , and the outermost boundary\nof the spatial grid is 131M and 126M , for models I and\nII.\nWe find that the waveform contains three different\nstages. The first stage is the burst. This occurs around\nthe time when the apparent horizon of the SMS forms.\nThe dominant contribution of the burst comes from the\naxisymmetric mode due to collapse. The second stage is\nthe quasinormal ringing of the newly formed BH. Since\nthe dominant frequency in the spectrum (Figs. 19 and\n20) is M \u03c9 \u2248 0.4, the dominant contribution is the axisymmetric one, using the fact that quasinormal mode\nfrequency of l = 2, m = 0 is M \u03c9 \u2248 0.40 \u2013 0.42 for\na BH with Kerr parameter a >\n\u223c 0.8M [29], where l, m\ndenotes the indices of spin \u22122-weighted spheroidal harmonics.

The feature corresponds to several peaks\nin the spectrum (Fig. 20), especially in the regime of\nM\u03c9 <\n\u223c 0.5. For model I, the quasi-stationary waveform\nremains for at least \u2206t \u223c 70M (Fig. 20). In this case\nthe spectra does not contain the peaks in the regime\nof M \u03c9 <\n\u223c 0.5. When we reduce the integration time of\nthe quasi-periodic waves (comparing the three panels in\nFig. 20), the spectrum becomes much smoother in the\nfrequency regime M \u03c9 >\n\u223c 0.5. Therefore the frequency\nregion of M \u03c9 >\n0.5\nplays\na role in the quasi-periodic\n\u223c\nwaveform. Although we do not know the origin of the\nlate-time quasi-periodic waves, we can discuss possible\ncandidates and their likelihood.\nFirstly we distinguish between the different possibilities for the amplification of the waves based on the dominant type of behaviour. The most obvious possibility\nwould be strong matter dynamics perturbing the essentially stationary Kerr spacetime given by the dominant\ncentral BH. The second possibility is a weaker, more indirect coupling, where either the matter dynamics in the\ndisk lead to gravitational waves, or a global oscillation or\n\nt/M\nFIG. 14: Same as Fig. 13, but we monitor the diagnostics at\nr = 3.95M (upper two panels) and 9.87M (lower two panels),\nrespectively.\n\nresonance of whole spacetime exists, including both the\nexterior matter and the BH.\nIn the first category where the wave emission is dominated by the motion of the fluid in Kerr spacetime,\nthere are two possibilities. One is that inhomogeneities\nor radial motion in the disk exist, leading to the wave\nemission. These can be viewed, to a first approximation, as small fluid fragments behaving approximately\nlike test particles orbiting a Kerr BH. If we further approximate the \"particle\" to be moving in a circular orbit\nthen the characteristic frequency \u03c9circular and the amplitude hcircular from the quadrupole formula of gravitational waves can be written as\n\u03c9circular = m\u03a9r0 ,\nrh+\n\ncircular\n\n= 7 \u00d7 10\n\n(3.12)\n\u22121\n\n3/2\n\n\u03bc(M \u03c9)\n\ncos \u03c9t, (3.13)\n\nwhere \u03a9r0 is the orbital angular velocity of the particle\nat the radius of ISCO r0 , and r is the distance from the\nsource. The typical frequency for a circular orbit can be\nalso applied for the scattering particle at the innermost\nradius r0 .

Initially all matter collapses in.\nHowever, once the quasi-stable disk forms in the interior\nthere is still some infalling matter left, which \"splashes\"\nonto the disk. This is reminiscent of the centrifugal\nbounce seen in early core-collapse simulations with a simple equation of state (e.g. the Type II multiple-bounce\nmodels of Ref. [31]). As the rotation rate increases and\nthe spacetime is near extreme Kerr, the chances of shocks\nappearing through some form of accretion are significantly increased, as shown as far back as Wilson [32].\nAfter submission, we note that simulations of core collapse ([33]) have seen gravitational waves due to rapidly\ndecelerated shocks. The shocks formed by the accreting\nmatter could lead to wave-packet like bursts of gravitational waves. As these form in the outer layers of the disk\nand predominantly propagate out, their effects are never\nseen in the Fourier coefficients shown in Figs. 11 \u2013 14. It\nis possible to approximately correlate the shocks appearing in Figs. 21 and 22 with the start of the quasi-periodic\nwaves in Figs. 17 and 18.

This idea\nis suggested from the spectra of gravitational waveform\n(Figs. 19 and 20). At every observed radius, there is a\npeak around M \u03c9 \u2248 0.5, which might correspond to the\nmotion of the particle at inner edge. However this idea\ncannot explain the enhancement of the quasi-periodic\nwaves when the newly formed BH is almost extremal.\nWe also note that the Fourier coefficients as shown in\nFigs. 11 \u2013 14 show non-axisymmetries growing in the interior and moving out far too late (in retarded time) to\ncause the enhanced gravitational waves.\nRemaining with the idea that the gravitational waves\n\n\f14\n\n2e-05\n\nr Re[\u03a84]\n\nr Re[\u03a84]\n\n4e-05\n2e-05\n0\n\n-2e-05\n\nr Re[\u03a84]\n\nr Re[\u03a84]\n\n2e-05\n-2e-05\n\n2e-05\n0\n\n-2e-05\n\n1e-05\n0\n\n-1e-05\n-2e-05\n2e-05\n\nr Re[\u03a84]\n\n-4e-05\n4e-05\n\nr Re[\u03a84]\n\n0\n\n-1e-05\n\n4e-05\n-4e-05\n\n2e-05\n0\n\n-2e-05\n-4e-05\n650\n\n1e-05\n\n1e-05\n0\n\n-1e-05\n\n700\n\n750\n\n800\n\n850\n\nt/M\nFIG. 17: Gravitational waveform measured with the Weyl\nscalar \u03a84 observed along the x-axis in the equatorial plane\nat r = 49.14M (top panel), r = 65.52M (middle panel) and\n98.29M (bottom panel) for model I. Note that the time at\nwhich the apparent horizon is first detected is t = 670M .\nTaking the wave propagation time from the source to the observer into account, the apparent horizon formation in the\nwaveform is roughly just before the peak due to the burst.\nInitially a standard burst and ringdown signal are seen (compare [30], especially their Fig. 18), but sustained gravitational\nwave emission indicate additional dynamics after BH formation.\n\nin the meridional plane show that shock waves are generated around t \u2248 734M for model I and t \u2248 828M for\nmodel II. Quasi-periodic waves in \u03a84 starts at t \u2248 780M\nat r \u2248 50M for model I, at t \u2248 870M at r \u2248 50M for\nmodel II. Since radiation propagates at speed of light,\nthose times for each model roughly correspond with each\nother. However, it seems unlikely that these shocks could\nproduce quasi-periodic waves of near constant amplitude\nas seen in model I, where the newly formed BH is not an\nextremal one (Fig. 17).\nIn the second category, we are looking for a property\nof the full spacetime including both the BH and the matter. As the Kerr BH contains the majority of the mass\nin the system, we would expect this to dominate. So either there must be some special property of quasi-normal\nmodes of near extremal Kerr BHs, or there must be a cou-\n\n-2e-05\n650\n\n700\n\n750\n\n800\n\n850\n\n900\n\n950\n\nt/M\nFIG. 18: Gravitational waveform measured with the Weyl\nscalar \u03a84 observed along the x-axis in the equatorial plane\nat r = 47.36M (top panel), r = 63.15M (middle panel) and\n94.72M (bottom panel) for model II.

Since we know that the imaginary\npart of the quasi-normal mode frequency goes to zero at\nextreme Kerr limit [34], there are long-lived modes for\nnear-extremal Kerr BHs, and hence small perturbations\nfrom the exterior matter may produce long-lived gravitational wave signals such as those seen in Fig. 17 for\nmodel I. It is not clear that this could easily lead to the\nstrong amplification seen for model II in Fig. 18.\nA final possibility that we consider in this category\nis a corotation resonance. In fact when the spin of the\nnewly formed BH is very close to extreme Kerr, the amplitude of the gravitational wave signal gradually grows\nafter the quasinormal ringing. We also check the azimuthal m modes of the rest mass density traced at the\ncertain radius in the equatorial plane, and found that the\nm = 2 mode starts growing exponentially after the ringdown (Fig. 16, second top panel). One possible explanation for the exponential growth of the m = 2 mode at late\ntimes is the existence of corotation resonance of the newly\n\n\f1e-05\n\n| F[r Re[\u03a84]]| |F[r Re[\u03a84]]|2 |F[r Re[\u03a84]]|2\n\n1e-05\n\n|F[r Re[\u03a84]]|\n\n2\n\n15\n\n1e-06\n\n1e-06\n\n1e-07\n1e-08\n\n1e-09\n\n1e-08\n\n|F[r Re[\u03a84]]|\n\n2\n\n1e-07\n\n1e-06\n\n1e-06\n\n1e-07\n\n2\n\n1e-08\n\n1e-08\n\n|F[r Re[\u03a84]]|\n\n2\n\n1e-07\n\n1e-09\n\n1e-06\n\n1e-06\n\n1e-07\n\n1e-07\n\n1e-08\n\n1e-08\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\nM\u03c9\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1e-09\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\nM\u03c9\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nFIG. 19: Spectra of the real part of the Weyl scalar \u03a84 observed along the x-axis in the equatorial plane at r = 49.14M\n(top panel), r = 65.52M (middle panel) and 98.29M (bottom\npanel) for model I.\n\nFIG. 20: Spectra of the Weyl scalar \u03a84 observed along the\nx-axis in the equatorial plane at r = 47.36M (top panel),\nr = 63.15M (middle panel) and 94.72M (bottom panel) for\nmodel II.\n\nformed disk triggered by the vibration of the hole. Note\nthat the necessary condition to excite corotation resonance in fluid mechanics is \u03c9chr = m\u03a9 (e.g. Ref. [35]),\nwhere \u03c9chr is the characteristic frequency of the system,\n\u03a9 the angular velocity. If the corotation resonance is\ntriggered by quasinormal ringing, the necessary condition\nfor triggering a corotation resonance is \u03c9qnm = m\u03a9 at a\ncertain radius of the interior star. The real part of the\nquasi-normal mode frequency of l = m = 2 increases with\nincreasing Kerr parameter, and becomes M \u03c9qnm = 1\nfor the extreme Kerr BH. The orbital velocity at ISCO\nalso increases with increasing\nKerr parameter, and be\u221a\ncomes M \u03a9r0 = (3 \u2212 3)/2 = m\u03c9particle for the extreme\nKerr BH (\u03c9qnm < m\u03c9particle ). Therefore, the condition\n\u03c9qnm = m\u03c9paricle is satisfied for m = 2 for a certain Kerr\nparameter near the extremal limit.\n\nsimulations in general relativity. We particularly focus\non the onset of collapse to form a rapidly rotating BH as\na final outcome.\nWe have found that the qualitative results of the evolution for the mass and spin of the final BH and disk\nare quite similar to the estimates that can be computed\nfrom the equilibrium configuration when the estimated,\n2\nfinal BH has J(BH) /M(BH)\n< 1. This result suggests that\nin the absence of a nonaxisymmetric instability, the estimate of the BH mass and the disk mass agree with a\nsimple axisymmetric picture that the specific angular momentum is conserved throughout the evolution, and the\nnewly formed BH swallows the matter up to the radius\nof the ISCO.\nWe have also found that a quasi-periodic wave occurs after the ringdown of a newly formed BH. As we\nwould normally expect the ringdown waveform to damp,\nit seems likely that the cause of this waveform is due to\nthe presence of the disk in some form. Furthermore, when\nthe newly formed BH is sufficiently close to extreme Kerr\nwith sufficient surrounding matter we have found that the\nwavesignal may be significantly amplified.\nWe have discussed several possibilities for the origin\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have investigated the collapse of differentially rotating SMSs, especially focusing on the post BH formation stage, by means of three dimensional hydrodynamic\n\n\f16\n\n15\n\nI-i\n\nz/M\n\nz/M\n\n15\n10\n5\n\n10\n5\n0\n\nI-ii\n10\n\nz/M\n\nz/M\n\n0\n\n5\n0\n\n5\n0\n\nz/M\n\nz/M\n\nII-iii\n\n10\n5\n0\n\n5\n\nII-iv\nz/M\n\n10\n5\n\n-10\n\n10\n\n0\n\nI-iv\n\n0\n-15\n\nII-ii\n\n10\n\nI-iii\n\nz/M\n\nII-i\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nx/M\nFIG. 21: Contours of the rest mass density in the meridional\nplane for model I.

[39]; various numerical\nimplementations are discussed in Refs. [20, 40, 41, 42]).\nIn particular this may indicate whether a strong perturbation of the BH geometry is connected to the gravitational waves seen here. However, it seems likely, comparing in particular to the results of Refs. [41, 42] where long\nterm evolutions of \"clean\" binary black hole systems are\nconsidered, that better numerical accuracy and longer integration times will be required in order to rule out any\nbut the strongest of perturbations.\n\n\u0012\n\nwhere d is the distance from the observer and \u2206EGW\nis the total radiated energy. We set R/M = 1, a\ncharacteristic mean radius during BH formation. Since\nthe main targets of LISA are gravitational radiation\nsources between 10\u22124 and 10\u22121 Hz, it is possible that\nLISA can search for the burst and quasi-normal ringing\nwaves accompanying rotating SMS collapse and formation of an SMBH. Moreover, the frequency of the quasiperiodic waves after the quasinormal ringing is quite similar to that of quasinormal ringing, so is in the detectable\nregime. Also the amplitude of the quasi-periodic wave is\nroughly 10% of the burst at the horizon, and hence this\nfeature can also be seen in LISA.\nAlthough we focus on the case of the collapse of differentially rotating SMS to a SMBH in this paper, our\nmodel is also applicable to the collapse of population III\nstars which are also radiation pressure dominated. In this\ncase, the mass range of the collapsing object becomes of\nthe order of a few hundred solar masses. Therefore the\nmost sensitive region for the detection of burst waves and\nquasinormal ringing waves becomes the order of hertz.\nSuch gravitational waves might be seen in Deci-hertz interferometer gravitational wave observatory (DECIGO)\n\n(4.1)\n(4.2)\n(4.3)\n(4.4)\n\n[43].\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank Nils Andersson, Leor Barack,\nCarsten Gundlach, Tomohiro Harada, Akihiro Ishibashi,\nMichael Jasiulek, Kei-ichi Maeda, Shinji Mukohyama\nand Erik Schnetter for discussions.
