A question of particular interest that\narises in a number of applications is related to fronts that invade an unstable\nequilibrium (for a review, see [7]). One of the well-known examples of such a\nsystem is given by a scalar reaction-diffusion equation in a cylindrical domain:\nut = \u2206u + f (u, y).\n\n(1.1)\n\nHere u = u(x, t) \u2208 R is the dependent variable, x \u2208 \u03a3 \u2282 Rn is a point in a\ncylindrical domain \u03a3 = \u03a9 \u00d7 R, whose cross-section \u03a9 \u2282 Rn\u22121 is a bounded\ndomain with the boundary of class C 2 (not necessarily simply-connected), and\nt \u2208 [0, +\u221e) is time. We will often write x = (y, z) \u2208 \u03a3, where y \u2208 \u03a9 is\nthe coordinate on the cylinder cross-section and z \u2208 R is the coordinate along\nthe cylinder axis. The function f : R \u00d7 \u03a9 \u2192 R is a nonlinear reaction term.\nOn different connected portions of the boundary we assume either Dirichlet\n\u2217 Department\n\nof Mathematical Sciences, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ\n07102, USA\n\u2020 Dipartimento di Matematica, Universit\u00e0 di Padova, Via Trieste 63, Padova, 35121, Italy\n\n1\n\n\for Neumann boundary conditions (see [8] for the motivation of this particular\nchoice of boundary conditions)\nu\n\n\u2202\u03a3\u00b1\n\n= 0,\n\n\u03bd * \u2207u\n\n\u2202\u03a30\n\n= 0,\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere \u2202\u03a3\u00b1 = \u2202\u03a9\u00b1 \u00d7 R and \u2202\u03a30 = \u2202\u03a90 \u00d7 R. Furthermore, we assume that\nu = 0 is an unstable solution of (1.1) in the sense of linear stability.\nBy front solutions of (1.1), one understands traveling wave solutions, which\nare special solutions of (1.1) of the form u(y, z, t) = \u016b(y, z \u2212 ct), connecting\nmonotonically two distinct equilibria, i.e., stationary z-independent solutions of\n(1.1). In the present context, of special interest are the fronts which invade the\nu = 0 equilibrium. Assuming the invasion happens from left to right, the profile\n\u016b > 0 of such fronts is described by the following equation:\n\u2206\u016b + c\u016bz + f (\u016b, y) = 0,\n\nlim \u016b(*, z) = 0 uniformly in \u03a9,\n\nz\u2192+\u221e\n\n(1.3)\n\nwith the same boundary conditions as in (1.2), where c > 0 is the propagation\nspeed. These solutions are known to play an important r\u00f4le in the long-time\nbehavior of solutions of (1.1) (for an overview, see e.g., [9]).\nThe problem of existence and uniqueness of solutions to (1.3) has a long\nhistory, going back to the pioneering works of Kolmogorov, Petrovsky and\nPiskunov [10], and within the present context has been extensively studied by\nBeretsycki and Nirenberg [11], and Vega [12, 13]. Specifically, Berestycki and\nNirenberg established existence, monotonicity, and uniqueness of solutions of\n(1.3) connecting zero to the smallest positive equilibrium for all c \u2265 c\u22171 , for\nsome c\u22171 > 0 (for the precise definition, see Sec. 2), in the case of Neumann\nboundary conditions [11, Theorem 1.9]. Their methods were later extended by\nVega to problems with Dirichlet boundary conditions [12, Theorem 3.4(B)]. We\nnote that in these works uniqueness of the front solutions is understood in the\nclass of functions connecting zero ahead of the front to a prescribed equilibrium\nbehind the front. In general, front solutions of (1.3) may fail to be unique, even\nfor a fixed value of c, if they are allowed to approach different equilibria. One\nexample of multiplicity of the front solutions to (1.3) was given by Vega under\nspecific assumptions on the set of equilibria of (1.1) [12, Remark 3.5(B)].\nThe question of multiplicity of solutions of (1.3) and (1.2) without prescribing the asymptotic behavior behind the front is largely open. The main goal\nof this paper is to provide some easily verifiable conditions to establish existence or non-existence of multiple solutions of (1.3). To this end, we develop\nvariational tools to study existence and multiplicity of supercritical fronts, i.e.,\nthe solutions of (1.3) with speed c > c\u2217 , where c\u2217 > 0 is some critical propagation velocity, whose precise value will be specified in Sec. 2. One of the\nby-products of our methods is an independent proof of existence of solutions\nto (1.3) obtained in [11, 12]. However, it is worth noticing that our method\ncan yield solutions of (1.3), (1.2) that are different from those of [11, 12] under\neasily verifiable conditions, thus establishing multiplicity of supercritical fronts\nfor certain ranges of propagation speed. At the same time, our variational characterization, together with some refined analysis of the decay of solutions ahead\n2\n\n\fof the front also yields global uniqueness of solutions of (1.3) and (1.2) for all\nc > c] , for some c] \u2265 c\u2217 which is readily computable. Thus, the solutions obtained in [11, 12] are the only positive traveling wave solutions for (1.1), (1.2)\ninvading the unstable equilibrium u = 0 for c large enough, irrespectively of the\nasymptotic behavior at z = \u2212\u221e. This is one of the main contributions of this\npaper, and we illustrate it by a simple example in which all the estimates are\nexplicit.\nOur approach is mostly variational, based on the ideas developed in [14\u201318],\nrelying on the fact that (1.3) is the Euler-Lagrange equation for a suitable\nfunctional \u03a6c defined on the exponentially weighted Sobolev space Hc1 (\u03a3) (see\nSection 2 for precise definitions). However, in the application of the direct\nmethod of calculus of variations to get existence of the traveling wave solutions of\ninterest, one runs into the difficulty that these solutions do not belong to Hc1 (\u03a3).\nTo overcome this difficulty, we first construct, by non-variational methods, an\nauxiliary function which solves (1.3) for z sufficiently large and subtract its\ncontribution from the integrand of \u03a6c , thus removing the divergence of the\nintegral. We then minimize the modified functional to obtain a non-trivial\nHc1 (\u03a3) correction to the prescribed auxiliary function. As a direct consequence,\nthe existence of a traveling front is established.\nWe notice that the solution constructed in this way may depend on the\nchoice of the auxiliary function and thus may be non-unique. Nevertheless,\nwe show that this does not happen for sufficiently large values of c, in which\ncase the obtained solution is the unique front solution of (1.3). The proof of\nuniqueness also has both a variational and a non-variational parts: first, using\ndelicate exponentially weighted L2 -estimates, we show that the difference of any\ntwo solutions with the same asymptotic decay at z = +\u221e belongs to Hc1 (\u03a3),\nand then we prove uniqueness by convexity of the respective functional for c\nlarge enough.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce hypotheses\nand notations and state main theorems. In Section 3 we construct an auxiliary\nfunction which represents the principle part of the traveling wave solution for\nlarge z. Section 4 describes the variational setting for the modified functional.\nIn Section 5 we present results on existence of traveling fronts and describe\ntheir properties. Section 6 is devoted to the proof of uniqueness of supercritical\nfronts traveling with sufficiently large speed. We also discuss a simple onedimensional example where the range of velocities for which uniqueness holds\ncan be explicitly computed. Finally, in Section 7 we prove a global stability\nresult for the supercritical fronts considered in Section 6.\n\n2\n\nPreliminaries and main results\n\nIn this section, we introduce the assumptions of our analysis and state our main\nresults. Throughout this paper we assume \u03a9 to be a bounded domain (connected\nopen set, not necessarily simply connected) with a boundary of class C 2 . We\nstart by listing the assumptions on the nonlinearity f which we will need in our\n\n3\n\n\fanalysis:\n(H1) The function f : [0, 1] \u00d7 \u03a9 \u2192 R satisfies\nf (1, y) \u2264 0.\n\nf (0, y) = 0,\n\n\u2200y \u2208 \u03a9.\n\n(2.1)\n\n(H2) For some \u03b3 \u2208 (0, 1)\nfu \u2208 C 0,\u03b3 ([0, 1] \u00d7 \u03a9),\n\nf \u2208 C 0,\u03b3 ([0, 1] \u00d7 \u03a9),\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere fu := \u2202f /\u2202u.\nNote that hypotheses (H1) and (H2) are, in some sense, the minimal assumptions\nneeded to guarantee global existence and basic regularity of solutions of (1.1)\nsatisfying\n0 \u2264 u \u2264 1.\n\n(2.3)\n\nFrom now on, when we speak of the solutions of either (1.1) or (1.3), we always\nassume that they satisfy (2.3).\nUnder the above hypotheses the following functional\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\nZ u\n1\n\u03a6c [u] :=\necz\n|\u2207u|2 + V (u, y) dx,\nV (u, y) := \u2212\nf (s, y) ds, (2.4)\n2\n\u03a3\n0\nis well-defined for all functions obeying (1.2) and (2.3) that lie in the exponentially weighted Sobolev space Hc1 (\u03a3), i.e., functions which satisfy\nZ\n\u0001\necz ( \u2207u|2 + u2 dx < \u221e,\n(2.5)\n\u03a3\n\nfor a fixed c > 0.\nOur final assumption on f concerns the stability of the trivial equilibrium\nu = 0. In this paper, we consider the situation, in which this equilibrium is\nlinearly unstable. This fact is expressed by the following hypothesis:\n(U) There holds\nR\n\u03bd0 :=\n\nmin\n1\n\n\u03c8\u2208H (\u03a9)\n\u03c8|\u2202\u03a9\u00b1 =0\n\n\u03a9\n\n(|\u2207y \u03c8|2 \u2212 fu (0, y)\u03c8 2 ) dy\nR\n< 0.\n\u03c8 2 dy\n\u03a9\n\n(2.6)\n\nIndeed, the constant \u03bd0 defined in (2.6) is the principal eigenvalue of the problem\n\u2206y \u03c8k + fu (0, y)\u03c8k + \u03bdk \u03c8k = 0,\n\n(2.7)\n\nwith boundary conditions as in (1.2). In particular, for the principal eigenvalue\nwe can assume \u03c80 to satisfy\n\u2206y \u03c80 + fu (0, y)\u03c80 + \u03bd0 \u03c80 = 0,\n\n\u03c80 > 0,\n4\n\n||\u03c80 ||L\u221e (\u03a9) = 1.\n\n(2.8)\n\n\fNote that under hypothesis (U) we have existence of a particular solution of\n(1.3) and (1.2) for some c\u2217 \u2265 c0 , where\n\u221a\nc0 := 2 \u2212\u03bd0 > 0,\n(2.9)\nwhich plays an important r\u00f4le for propagation with front-like initial data [18].\nAs was shown in [18], there are precisely two alternatives: (i) either there exists\na non-trivial minimizer of \u03a6c\u2020 in Hc1\u2020 (\u03a3) subject to (1.2) for some c\u2020 > c0 , in\nwhich case c\u2217 = c\u2020 ; or (ii) there are no non-trivial minimizers of \u03a6c in Hc1 (\u03a3)\nsubject to (1.2) for all c > c0 , in which case c\u2217 = c0 and there is a minimal wave\nwith speed c0 . For our purposes here, it is convenient to introduce the following\nequivalent characterization of c\u2217 :\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u2217\nc := inf c > 0 : inf \u03a6c [u] = 0 ,\n(2.10)\n0\u2264u\u22641\n\nwhere the infimum of \u03a6c is taken over all functions in Hc1 (\u03a3) satisfying (1.2).\nThe equivalence of the two definitions of c\u2217 is shown by Proposition 5.1.\nFor c > c\u2217 any positive solution of (1.3) and (1.2) is expected to satisfy\n\u221a\nc \u00b1 c2 + 4\u03bd\n\u2212\u03bb\u2212 (c,\u03bd0 )z\n,\n(2.11)\n\u016b(y, z) ' a\u03c80 (y)e\n,\n\u03bb\u00b1 (c, \u03bd) =\n2\nas z \u2192 +\u221e, with some a > 0 and with \u03c80 > 0 being the minimizer of the\nRayleigh quotient in (2.6) normalized as in (2.8). At least formally, the asymptotic behavior of positive solutions of (1.3) and (1.2) can be obtained by linearizing (1.3) around u = 0, leading to the formula in (2.11) with the exponential\ndecay rate determined by either \u03bb+ (c, \u03bd0 ) or \u03bb\u2212 (c, \u03bd0 ). However, the case corresponding to \u03bb+ (c, \u03bd0 ) is impossible, since then the solution would belong to\nHc1 (\u03a3), i.e., it would be a variational traveling wave (for the definition and further discussion, see [16\u201318]). But by [17, Proposition 3.5] this contradicts the\nassumption c > c\u2217 . In other words, for c > c\u2217 the traveling wave solutions\nacquire fat tails.\nIt is also well-known that solutions of (1.3) become z-independent as z \u2192\n\u2212\u221e. Thus, as z \u2192 \u2212\u221e the function \u016b(*, z) is expected to approach a critical\npoint of the energy functional\n\u0013\nZ \u0012\n1\nE[v] =\n|\u2207y v|2 + V (v, y) dy,\n(2.12)\n\u03a9 2\nwhich is defined for all v \u2208 H 1 (\u03a9) with values in [0, 1] satisfying Dirichlet\nboundary conditions on \u2202\u03a9\u00b1 .1 By hypothesis (H2) the critical points of E\nsatisfy the equation\n\u2206y v + f (v, y) = 0,\n\nv|\u2202\u03a9\u00b1 = 0, \u03bd * \u2207v|\u2202\u03a90 = 0.\n\n(2.13)\n\n1 In the variational context throughout this paper, the Dirichlet boundary conditions are\nunderstood in the usual sense of considering the completion of the family of smooth functions whose support vanishes at the Dirichlet portion of the boundary with respect to the\ncorresponding Sobolev norm.\n\n5\n\n\fSimilarly to the case of z \u2192 +\u221e discussed in the previous paragraph, the\nconvergence of the traveling wave solution to v = limz\u2192\u2212\u221e \u016b(*, z) satisfying\n(2.13) can be, at least formally, obtained from the analysis of (1.3) linearized\naround v.

These are the traveling wave\nsolutions which are minimizers of the functional \u03a6w\nc defined as\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n1\n1\n2\n2\nw\ncz\n|\u2207u| + V (u, y) \u2212 |\u2207w| \u2212 V (w, y) dx,\n(2.17)\n\u03a6c [u] =\ne\n2\n2\n\u03a3\nfor some suitably chosen w : \u03a3 \u2192 R. Specifically, the function w \u2208 C 2 (\u03a3) \u2229\nC 1 (\u03a3) should solve (1.3) and (1.2) far ahead and far behind the front. As we\nshow in Sec. 4, the functional \u03a6w\nc [u] is then well defined for all u satisfying (2.3)\nand u \u2212 w \u2208 Hc1 (\u03a3).\nOur existence and variational characterization result is given by the following\ntheorem.\n\n6\n\n\fTheorem 1. Assume hypotheses (H1), (H2) and (U) are true. Then, for every\nc > c\u2217 and a \u2208 R there exists \u016b \u2208 C 2 (\u03a3)\u2229C 1 (\u03a3)\u2229W 1,\u221e (\u03a3) such that 0 < \u016b < 1\nand:\n(i) \u016b solves (1.3) and (1.2), and there exists w \u2208 C 2 (\u03a3) \u2229 C 1 (\u03a3) with values\nin [0, 1] solving (1.3) and (1.2) in \u03a9 \u00d7 (\u2212\u221e, \u2212z0 ) \u222a \u03a9 \u00d7 (z0 , +\u221e) for some\nz0 > 0, such that the function \u016b minimizes \u03a6w\nc [u] over all u satisfying\n(2.3), such that u \u2212 w \u2208 Hc1 (\u03a3).\n(ii) \u016b(y, z) = a\u03c80 (y)e\u2212\u03bb\u2212 (c,\u03bd0 )z + O(e\u2212\u03bbz ), for some \u03bb > \u03bb\u2212 (c, \u03bd0 ) and \u03c80\nsolving (2.8), uniformly in C 1 (\u03a9 \u00d7 [R, +\u221e)), as R \u2192 +\u221e.\n(iii) \u016b is a strictly monotonically decreasing function of z, and we have \u016b(*, z) \u2192\nv uniformly in C 1 (\u03a9), where 0 < v \u2264 1 is a critical point of E, and\nE[v] < 0.\n(iv) \u03bd\u03030 \u2265 0, moreover, if \u03bd\u03030 > 0, then \u016b(y, z) = v(y) + \u00e3\u03c8\u03030 (y)e\u2212\u03bb\u2212 (c,\u03bd\u03030 )z +\nO(e\u2212\u03bbz ), with some \u00e3 < 0 and \u03bb < \u03bb\u2212 (c, \u03bd\u03030 ), uniformly in C 1 (\u03a9 \u00d7\n(\u2212\u221e, R]), as R \u2192 \u2212\u221e.\n(v) If w\u0303 \u2208 C 2 (\u03a3) \u2229 C 1 (\u03a3) with values in [0, 1] solves (1.3) and (1.2) in \u03a9 \u00d7\n(\u2212\u221e, \u2212z\u03030 ) \u222a \u03a9 \u00d7 (z\u03030 , +\u221e) for some z\u03030 > 0 and w\u0303 \u2212 w \u2208 Hc1 (\u03a3), then \u016b\nalso minimizes \u03a6w\u0303\nc .\nLet us point out that existence results for supercritical fronts in cylinders\nwere first obtained in the classical work of Berestycki and Nirenberg under a\nfew extra assumptions [11] (see also [12, 13]). Specifically, they assumed (in our\nnotation and setting) that if v1 is the smallest positive critical point of E (in\nthe sense that if 0 < v \u2264 1 is a critical point of E, then v \u2265 v1 ) and if v1 is\nstable, i.e., if \u03bd\u03030 > 0 with v = v1 in (2.14), then there exists a unique (up to\ntranslations) traveling wave solution approaching zero from above as z \u2192 +\u221e\nand v1 from below as z \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Note that existence of v1 and the property\n\u03bd\u03030 \u2265 0 for v = v1 follows immediately from our hypotheses.\nIt is easy to see that the existence and monotonicity result for fronts connecting zero and v1 may also be obtained from a variant of our Theorem 1,\nin which a minimizer of \u03a6w\nc is constructed in the class of functions bounded\nabove by v1 . More precisely, let us define the value of c\u22171 by (2.10), in which the\ninfimum is taken over all u \u2208 Hc1 (\u03a3) satisfying (1.2) and such that u \u2264 v1 :\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u2217\nc1 = inf c > 0 : inf \u03a6c [u] = 0 ,\n(2.18)\n0\u2264u\u2264v1\n\nwhere, again, the infimum is taken over all u \u2208 Hc1 (\u03a3) satisfying (1.2). Then\nunder hypotheses (H1), (H2), and (U), for every c > c\u22171 \u2265 c0 and every a \u2208 R\nthere exists \u016b which satisfies the conclusions of Theorem 1 with v = v1 , where\nv1 is the smallest positive solution of (2.13). In particular, it can be seen from\nTheorem 1 that \u016b is the minimizer of \u03a6w\nc for all w with values in [0, 1], such\nthat w \u2212 \u016b \u2208 Hc1 (\u03a3).\n7\n\n\fIt is important to point out that using their sliding domains method, Berestycki and Nirenberg also proved uniqueness of solutions of (1.3) and (1.2) connecting zero and a non-degenerate v1 for all c > c\u22171 (see also [12, 13, 19]). On\nthe other hand, a priori one cannot expect uniqueness in the more general class\nof solutions satisfying (2.3), even in one dimension (see the counter-example in\nSec. 6). A natural question, then, is whether for a given c > c\u2217 the minimizer\ngiven by Theorem 1 is the solution obtained by Berestycki and Nirenberg. We\ncan give a negative answer to this question in the case when c\u2217 > c\u22171 for a certain\nrange of c > c\u2217 .\nIndeed, suppose c\u2217 > c\u22171 . Then, since c\u22171 \u2265 c0 , there exists a non-trivial minimizer \u016b\u2217 of \u03a6c\u2217 among all 0 \u2264 u \u2264 1. Furthermore, since \u016b\u2217 is not a minimizer\nof \u03a6c\u2217 [u] over all u \u2264 v1 , we have limz\u2192\u2212\u221e \u016b\u2217 (*, z) > v1 . In particular, this\nmeans that for\n\u001a\n\u001b\nc\u2020v1 := inf c > 0 : inf \u03a6vc 1 [u] = 0\n(2.19)\nv1 \u2264u\u22641\n\nwe have c\u2020v1 \u2265 c\u2217 . If not, for u1 = min(\u016b\u2217 , v1 ) and u2 = max(\u016b\u2217 , v1 ) we would\nobtain \u03a6c\u2217 [\u016b\u2217 ] = \u03a6c\u2217 [u1 ] + \u03a6vc 1 [u2 ] \u2265 \u03a6c\u2217 [u1 ], implying that u1 \u2264 v1 is a nontrivial minimizer. However, this contradicts the fact that there are no non-trivial\nminimizers of \u03a6c\u2217 that lie below v1 .\nIn fact c\u2020v1 > c\u2217 , since the infimum in (2.19) is attained, with the value of\n\u2020\ncv1 being the speed of the non-trivial minimizer of \u03a6v\u20201 over all u, such that\ncv1\n\nu \u2212 v1 \u2208 Hc1 (\u03a3) and v1 \u2264 u \u2264 1. Indeed, there exists a sequence cn \u2192 c\u2020v1 from\nbelow and a sequence of functions un \u2265 v1 , such that \u03a6vcn1 [un ] < 0. Therefore,\nin view of the fact that \u03bd\u03030 \u2265 0 for v = v1 , by [18, Theorem 3.3] applied to \u03a6vc 1\n(see also the proof of [20, Lemma 3.5]), there exists a non-trivial minimizer of\n\u03a6vc 1 for some c \u2265 c\u2020v1 , and by the definition of c\u2020v1 and the arguments in the\nproof of Proposition 5.1 we have c = c\u2020v1 .\nSince by the argument in the proof of [20, Lemma 3.5] for every 0 \u2264 u \u2264 v1 ,\nsuch that u \u2212 w \u2208 Hc1 (\u03a3), with w as in Theorem 1, and u(*, z) \u2192 v1 in C 1 (\u03a9) as\nz \u2192 \u2212\u221e, the value of \u03a6w\nc [u] can be lowered by extending u above v1 for every\nc < c\u2020v1 , we have the following consequence of Theorem 1:\nCorollary 2.1. Let c\u2217 > c\u22171 . Then c\u2020v1 > c\u2217 , and for every c\u2217 < c < c\u2020v1 the\nsolution \u016b in Theorem 1 has v > v1 .\nIn other words, if c\u2217 > c\u22171 , for every c as in Corollary 2.1 and every a \u2208 R there\nexist at least two solutions of (1.3) and (1.2) satisfying (2.11).\nRemark 2.2. Note that the argument leading to Corollary 2.1 also works under\nthe assumption that c\u2020v1 > c\u2217 when c\u2217 = c\u22171 = c0 .\nLet us now go back to the question under which conditions the solutions\nof Berestycki and Nirenberg, which connect zero with v1 for every c > c\u22171 are,\nin fact, the unique (up to translations) solutions of (1.3) and (1.2). In one\ndimension it is possible to use phase plane arguments to show that for large\n\n8\n\n\fenough values of c the only solution of (1.3) connects zero to v1 (e.g., under nondegeneracy of v1 ). What about the higher-dimensional case? In the following we\nshow that the solution connecting zero to v1 is the only traveling wave solution\nfor large enough speeds, up to translations.\nWe start by introducing\nR\n(|\u2207y \u03c8|2 \u2212 q(y)\u03c8 2 ) dy\n\u03a9\nR\n,\nq(y) := max fu (s, y). (2.20)\n\u03bd\u03020 := min\ns\u2208[0,1]\n\u03c8 2 dy\n\u03c8\u2208H 1 (\u03a9)\n\u03a9\n\u03c8|\u2202\u03a9\u00b1 =0\n\nIn analogy with (2.9), we can then define the quantity\np\nc] := 2 \u2212\u03bd\u03020 ,\n\n(2.21)\n\nwhich is easily seen to satisfy c0 \u2264 c] < \u221e. It turns out that c] gives a lower\nbound for the values of c, for which the solution of (1.3) and (1.2) is unique,\nup to translations. Our global uniqueness result, which relies on the variational\ncharacterization of the obtained solutions is contained in the following theorem.\nTheorem 2. Let c > c] , where c] \u2265 c0 is defined in (2.21), and let the assumptions of Theorem 1 be satisfied. Then c] \u2265 c\u2217 , and for every c > c] there exists\na unique solution of (1.3) and (1.2) (up to translations).\nFurthermore, the unique solution of Theorem 2 is globally stable with respect\nto perturbations with sufficiently fast exponential decay.\nTheorem 3. Let \u016b be the traveling wave solution with speed c > c] from Theorem 2, and let 0 \u2264 u0 \u2264 1 satisfy u0 \u2212 \u016b \u2208 L2c0 (\u03a3), for some c0 > 2\u03bb\u2212 (c, \u03bd\u03020 ).\nThen, if u is the solution of (1.1) and (1.2) with u(x, 0) = u0 (x), we have\n||u(y, z + ct, t) \u2212 \u016b(y, z)||L20 (\u03a3) \u2264 Ce\u2212\u03c3t ,\nc\n\n(2.22)\n\nfor some \u03c3 > 0, C > 0.\nWe note that the result of Theorem 3 also holds in other norms, e.g. with\nrespect to uniform convergence on compacts (see [20] for details).\nNote that as a direct consequence of Theorems 1\u20133 we have a complete\ncharacterization of the supercritical fronts in problems involving nonlinearities\nof the kind that was originally considered in [10, 21]:\nCorollary 2.3. Under hypotheses (H1), (H2) and (U), assume that, in addition, fu (u, *) \u2264 fu (0, *) for all u \u2208 [0, 1]. Then for each c > c0 there exists a\nunique (up to translations) solution of (1.3) and (1.2), which is globally stable in the sense of Theorem 3 with respect to perturbations in L2c0 (\u03a3), with any\nc0 > 2\u03bb\u2212 (c, \u03bd0 ).\nThis corollary is obtained by noting that under its assumption on the nonlinearity we simply have \u03bd0 = \u03bd\u03020 . Therefore, c] = c0 and, in particular, c\u2217 = c0 as\nwell. In fact, in view of the conclusion of Theorem 1(ii) the following convergence result holds under a single assumption on the rate of exponential decay\nof the initial data.\n9\n\n\fCorollary 2.4. Under the assumptions of Corollary 2.3, let c > c0 and assume\nthat u0 (y, z) = a\u03c80 (y)e\u2212\u03bb\u2212 (c,\u03bd0 )z + O(e\u2212\u03bbz ), for some a \u2208 R and \u03bb > \u03bb\u2212 (c, \u03bd0 ).\nThen the conclusion of Theorem 3 holds.\nIn the rest of the paper (H1), (H2), (U) are always assumed to be satisfied.\n\n3\n\nThe front far ahead\n\nIn this section we start the investigation of supercritical traveling wave solutions.\nAs was mentioned in the introduction, the first important step in the study of\ntraveling fronts is the construction of an auxiliary function which solves (1.3)\nand (1.2) for z large positive and has the asymptotic behavior given by (2.11).\nSpecifically, we will construct a function w with the following properties:\n(W1) w \u2208 C 2 (\u03a3) \u2229 C 1 (\u03a3) and solves\n\u2206w + cwz + f (w, y) = 0,\n\n(3.1)\n\nin \u03a3 for z > 3, with the same boundary conditions as in (1.2).\n(W2) There exists \u03b4 > 0 and a > 0 sufficiently small, such that\nw(y, z) = a\u03c80 (y)e\u2212\u03bb\u2212 (c,\u03bd0 )z (1 + O(e\u2212\u03b4z )),\n\nz \u2192 +\u221e,\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere \u03bb\u2212 (c, \u03bd0 ) and \u03c80 are defined in (2.11) and (2.8).\n(W3) We have\n0 \u2264 w(y, z) \u2264 2a\u03c80 (y) \u2264 1\n\n\u2200(y, z) \u2208 \u03a3,\n\n(3.3)\n\nand w = 0 for all z < 2.\nIn order to establish existence of a function w satisfying (W1) \u2013 (W3), we\nonly need to prove existence of a solution of (3.1) satisfying (W2) and (W3) for\nz > 2. Then we obtain the desired function by multiplying this solution with a\ncutoff function \u03b7 \u2208 C \u221e (R), such that \u03b7(z) = 1 for z > 3 and \u03b7(z) = 0 for z < 2.\nBy translational symmetry in the z-direction, any translate of solution of\n(3.1) is once again a solution for sufficiently large z. Translations of w are\nequivalent to adjusting the value of the constant a in (3.2). Therefore, fixing\nthe constant a in (3.2) is equivalent to fixing translations of the solution of\n(3.1). Thus, the choice of a particular value of a is inconsequential. Indeed,\nconsidering solutions with a fixed and z large enough positive is equivalent to\nconsidering the problem for small enough a > 0 and z > 0. Conceptually, this\nchoice of w resembles selecting one element of the stable manifold corresponding\nto the fixed point u = 0 in the one-dimensional setting (in the sense of ordinary\ndifferential equations).\nThe following proposition establishes existence of a function w with all the\ndesired properties.\n10\n\n\fProposition 3.1. For every c > c0 and every a > 0 sufficiently small, there\nexists a function w with properties (W1)\u2013(W3).\nThe proof of this proposition is based on two lemmas. We first explicitly\nconstruct sub and supersolutions (see definitions (i) and (ii) below) for the\nproblem (3.1) on the right half cylinder (Lemma 3.2). Next we show that if\none restrict the problem (3.1) on bounded sections of the cylinder, then this\nproblem has a solution squeezed between sub and supersolutions (Lemma 3.3).\nWe then complete the proof of Proposition 3.1 by passing to the limit.\nIn order to proceed, we introduce the notions of sub and supersolutions:\n(i) We call w a supersolution of the problem (3.1), if w \u2208 C 2 (\u03a9 \u00d7 (0, +\u221e))\nsatisfies the boundary conditions in (1.2) and\n\u2206w + cwz + f (w, y) \u2264 0,\n\nz > 0,\n\n(3.4)\n\nwith\ny \u2208 \u03a9.\n\nw(0, y) = 2a\u03c80 (y),\n\n(3.5)\n\n(ii) We call w a subsolution for the problem (3.1), if w \u2208 C 2 (\u03a9 \u00d7 (0, +\u221e))\nsatisfies the boundary conditions in (1.2) and\n\u2206w + cwz + f (w, y) \u2265 0,\n\nz > 0,\n\n(3.6)\n\nwith\nw(0, y) = 0,\n\ny \u2208 \u03a9.\n\n(3.7)\n\nLemma 3.2. There exist w and w, the sub- and super-solutions of (3.1), which\nsatisfy (W2) and (W3), for every a > 0 small enough.\nProof. The proof follows by explicit construction of w and w verifying (1.2),\n(3.4) \u2013 (3.7), (W2), and (W3). By assumption (H2), for ||w||L\u221e (\u03a3) \u2264 2a \u001c 1\nthere exist constants k, k\u0304 > 0, such that\nfu (0, y)w \u2212 k|w|1+\u03b3 \u2264 f (w, y) \u2264 fu (0, y)w + k\u0304|w|1+\u03b3 .\n\n(3.8)\n\nTherefore, the function w satisfying (1.2), (3.5) and\nN (w\u0304) := \u2206w + cwz + fu (0, y)w + k\u0304w1+\u03b3 \u2264 0,\n\n(3.9)\n\nin \u03a9 \u00d7 (0, +\u221e) automatically satisfies (3.4), and thus is a supersolution.\nLet us show that the function\nw(z, y) = a\u03c80 (y)e\u2212\u03bb\u2212 z (1 + e\u2212\u03b4z )\n\n(3.10)\n\nis a supersolution for some 0 < \u03b4 \u001c 1 (throughout the proof we use the shorthand \u03bb\u2212 for \u03bb\u2212 (c, \u03bd0 )). Indeed, substituting this function into (3.9), we obtain\nN (w)\n\n= a(\u2206y \u03c80 + (\u03bb2\u2212 \u2212 c\u03bb\u2212 + fu (0, y))\u03c80 )e\u2212\u03bb\u2212 z (1 + e\u2212\u03b4z )\n\u2212a\u03b4(c \u2212 2\u03bb\u2212 \u2212 \u03b4)\u03c80 e\u2212(\u03bb\u2212 +\u03b4)z\n1+\u03b3\n\n+k\u0304a\n\n\u03c801+\u03b3 e\u2212(1+\u03b3)\u03bb\u2212 z (1\n11\n\n+e\n\n(3.11)\n\n\u2212\u03b4z 1+\u03b3\n\n)\n\n.\n\n\fThe first line in (3.11) is identically zero in view of the definition of \u03bb\u2212 and \u03c80 ,\nsee (2.8) and (2.11). Therefore,\nN (w)\n\n=\n\n\u2212a\u03b4(c \u2212 2\u03bb\u2212 \u2212 \u03b4)\u03c80 e\u2212(\u03bb\u2212 +\u03b4)z\n\u001a\n\u001b\nk\u0304a\u03b3 \u03c80\u03b3 (1 + e\u2212\u03b4z )1+\u03b3 \u2212(\u03b3\u03bb\u2212 \u2212\u03b4)z\ne\n\u00d7 1\u2212\n.\n\u03b4(c \u2212 2\u03bb\u2212 \u2212 \u03b4)\n\n(3.12)\n\nSince also c > 2\u03bb\u2212 by (2.11), the factor multiplying the expression in the curly\nbrackets in (3.12) is negative for \u03b4 sufficiently small. Let us show that the\nexpression in the curly brackets can be made positive by a suitable choice of a\nand \u03b4. Indeed, since the expression in the curly bracket is an increasing function\nof z for \u03b4 small enough, we only need to verify its positivity at z = 0. Then,\nthe result easily follows by choosing \u03b4 sufficiently small first, and then choosing\na such that a\u03b3 \u001c \u03b4.\nWe now turn to sub-solutions. By the same argument as above, it is enough\nto show that\nM(w) := \u2206w + cwz + fu (0, y)w \u2212 kw1+\u03b3 \u2265 0\n\n(3.13)\n\nin \u03a9 \u00d7 (0, +\u221e) for some w \u2265 0. Similarly to (3.10), we choose\nw = a\u03c80 e\u2212\u03bb\u2212 z (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b4z ).\n\n(3.14)\n\nSubstituting this into (3.13) and using the same arguments as for the supersolution, we obtain\nM(w)\n\n=\n\na\u03b4(c \u2212 2\u03bb\u2212 \u2212 \u03b4)\u03c80 e\u2212(\u03bb\u2212 +\u03b4)z\n\u001a\n\u001b\nka\u03b3 \u03c80\u03b3 (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b4z )1+\u03b3 \u2212(\u03b3\u03bb\u2212 \u2212\u03b4)z\n\u00d7 1\u2212\ne\n,\n\u03b4(c \u2212 2\u03bb\u2212 \u2212 \u03b4)\n\n(3.15)\n\nwhich is positive for a similar choice of \u03b4 and a.\nFinally, we note that, as a consequence of our construction, the functions w\nand w satisfy (3.2) and (3.3).\nWe next establish existence of a classical solution of (3.1) on finite sections\nof the cylinder away from the boundaries.\nLemma 3.3. Let R > 1. Then there exists wR \u2208 C 2 (\u03a9\u00d7(1, R))\u2229C 1 (\u03a9\u00d7[1, R])\nsolving (3.1) in \u03a9 \u00d7 [1, R], and satisfying w \u2264 wR \u2264 w, where w and w are as\nin Lemma 3.2.\nProof. First, the proof of existence of a weak solution of (3.1) in \u03a3R = \u03a9\u00d7(0, R+\n1), sandwiched between the sub- and the super-solutions of Lemma 3.2 follows by\nstandard monotone iteration argument (see, e.g., [22, Sec. 9.3].) Furthermore,\nby standard elliptic regularity, this solution is regular in the interior of \u03a3R [23].\ne R = \u03a9 \u00d7 (1, R) \u2282\u2282 \u03a3R\nNow, we apply Lp regularity theory to the solution in \u03a3\n[23, Theorem 9.13] to obtain regularity up to the boundary on the Dirichlet\nportions \u2202\u03a3\u00b1 of the cylinder:\n0\n||wR ||W 2,p (\u03a3\ne R ) \u2264 C(||wR ||Lp (\u03a3R ) + ||f ||Lp (\u03a3R ) ) \u2264 C ||wR ||Lp (\u03a3R ) ,\n\n12\n\n(3.16)\n\n\ffor some C, C 0 > 0 and any p < \u221e, where we took into account hypothesis (H2)\ne R ), for any \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1). By\non f . Hence, by Sobolev imbedding wR is in C 1,\u03b1 (\u03a3\ne\nconstruction, w \u2264 wR \u2264 w in the closure of \u03a3R .\nProof of Proposition 3.1. We now finish the proof of Proposition 3.1 by passing\nto the limit R \u2192 \u221e in Lemma 3.3. Observe that by the bounds of Lemma 3.3\nand the exponential decay of w and w of Lemma 3.2, we have ||wR ||Lp (\u03a9\u00d7(1,R)) \u2264\nC, where C > 0 is independent of R. Therefore, by the estimate of (3.16) we\n2,p\nhave wR \u2192 w in Wloc\n(\u03a9 \u00d7 (1, \u221e)) on a sequence of Rk \u2192 \u221e. In view of\narbitrariness of p < \u221e, the convergence of wR to w is also in C 1 (\u03a9 \u00d7 [2, R \u2212 1]),\nfor any R > 3. Hence, the limit w is a weak solution of (3.1) in \u03a9 \u00d7 [2, \u221e), and\nby standard elliptic regularity is also a classical solution. The proof is completed\nby multiplying the obtained solution by a cutoff function.\nRemark 3.4. Our proof guarantees existence of infinitely many functions satisfying (W1) \u2013 (W3), since existence of a solution for (3.1) also holds for each\nfixed boundary data at z = 0 satisfying (3.3).\n\n4\n\nVariational setting\n\nAs was already noted in the Introduction, certain solutions of (1.3) may be\nviewed as critical points of the functional \u03a6c [u] introduced in (2.4). This, however, poses some restrictions on the type of traveling wave solutions (which are\nthe so-called variational traveling waves [16\u201318]) captured by this approach. Indeed, in view of the presence of the exponential weight in the functional the\nset of admissible functions must be characterized by the natural exponential\ndecay at z = +\u221e. At the same time, it is known (see, e.g. [11, 13]) that when\nu = 0 is an unstable equilibrium of (1.1), generically there are traveling wave\nsolutions which fail to have this natural exponential decay. In this situation\nthe use of a variational approach to the construction of traveling wave solutions\nseems problematic due the divergence of the respective integrals, even though\nformally (1.3) is still the Euler-Lagrange equation for \u03a6c . We propose to eliminate this divergence by subtracting the divergent part of the integrand in the\ndefinition of \u03a6c . Namely, we start by introducing the modified functional in\n(2.17), where w is a function satisfying properties (W1) \u2013 (W3) of Sec. 3. In\nother words, we subtract from the integrand in the definition of \u03a6c its value\nobtained by substituting an exact solution of (1.3) for z > 3 (property (W1) of\nw) and characterized by a prescribed exponential decay at z = +\u221e (property\n(W2) of w). Note that existence of w with these properties was proved in Sec.\n3 by non-variational techniques.\nWe next identify the suitable admissible class of functions u on which the\nnew functional \u03a6w\nc [u] makes sense. Let u = w + h, for some unknown function\n\n13\n\n\fw\nh : \u03a3 \u2192 R. With this definition, we now have \u03a6w\nc [u] = \u03a8c [h], where\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n2\n0\ncz 1\n\u03a8w\n[h]\n=\n|\u2207h|\n+\nV\n(w\n+\nh,\ny)\n\u2212\nV\n(w,\ny)\n\u2212\nV\n(w,\ny)h\ndx\ne\nc\n2\n\u03a3\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n\u2212\necz \u2206w + cwz \u2212 V 0 (w, y) h dx,\n\n(4.1)\n\n\u03a3\n\nwhere here and throughout the rest of this section we use the notation V 0 (u, y) :=\n\u2202V (u, y)/\u2202u and V 00 (u, y) := \u2202 2 V (u, y)/\u2202u2 . Observe that as long as u(x) \u2208\n[0, 1] for all x \u2208 \u03a3, we can use Taylor formula to rewrite \u03a8w\nc [h] in the following\nform\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n1 00\n2\n2\ncz 1\n|\u2207h|\n+\nV\n(\u0169,\ny)h\ndx\n\u03a8w\n[h]\n=\ne\nc\n2\n2\n\u03a3\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ 3Z\ncz\n0\n\u2212\ne\n\u2206w + cwz \u2212 V (w, y) h dydz,\n(4.2)\n2\n\n\u03a9\n\nfor some \u0169 sandwiched between w and u. Here we took into account hypothesis\n(H2) and that, by property (W1) of w, the integrand in the last term in (4.1)\nis identically zero for z > 3 and z < 2. Now, since V 0 , V 00 , w, wz are uniformly\nbounded and \u2206w \u2208 L2 (\u03a9 \u00d7 (2, 3)), the functional \u03a8w\nc is well-defined within the\n,\ndefined\nas\nfollows:\nadmissible class Aw\nc\nDefinition 4.1. A function h : \u03a3 \u2192 R is said to belong to the admissible class\n1\nAw\nc , if h \u2208 Hc (\u03a3) and 0 \u2264 h(x) + w(x) \u2264 1 for all x \u2208 \u03a3.\nNote that the assumption that h \u2208 Aw\nc implies that u = w + h has values in\nthe unit interval is not too restrictive, in view of hypothesis (H1), since u = 0\nand u = 1 are sub- and super-solutions of (1.3) and, hence, are the natural\nbarriers [24].\nIn order to apply the direct method of calculus of variation, we need to\nestablish weak sequential lower-semicontinuity and coercivity of the functional\n\u03a8w\nc in the considered function class. Lower-semicontinuity in the considered\nclass of problems was studied in [17], and we have\nProposition 4.2. For all c > c0 , the functional \u03a8w\nc is sequentially lowersemicontinuous in the weak topology of Hc1 (\u03a3) within Aw\nc .\nProof. The proof follows exactly as in [17, Proposition 5.5].\nThus, the main difficulty in applying a variational approach to supercritical\nfronts has to do with coercivity of \u03a8w\nc . Below we show that coercivity indeed\nholds for all c > c\u2217 .\nw\n\u2217\nProposition 4.3. The functional \u03a8w\nc is coercive in Ac for every c > c .\n\nProof. We carry out the proof in 4 steps.\n\n14\n\n\fStep 1 First of all, since h, V 0 , w, wz are uniformly bounded and since \u2206w \u2208\nL2 (\u03a9 \u00d7 (2, 3)), by a straightforward application of Cauchy-Schwarz inequality\nwe have\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ 3Z\ncz\n0\ne\n(4.3)\n\u2206w + cwz \u2212 V (w, y) h dydz \u2264 K1 ,\n2\n\n\u03a9\n\nfor some K1 > 0. On the other hand, using the formula in the proof of [17,\nProposition 6.9] and the fact that by the definition of c\u2217 we have \u03a6c0 [\u03c1] \u2265 0 for\nall c0 \u2208 (c\u2217 , c) and all \u03c1 \u2208 Hc10 (\u03a3), it holds that\nZ\n\u03a6c [h] =\n\u03a3\n\necz\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n2 Z\n1\nc2 \u2212 c0\n|\u2207h|2 + V (h, y) dx \u2265\necz h2z dx.\n2\n2c2\n\u03a3\n\nTherefore, we have the following estimate:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n2\nw\ncz 1\n|\u2207h| + V (h, y) dx\n\u03a8c [h] + K1 \u2265\ne\n2\n\u03a3\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\ncz\n0\n+\ne\nV (w + h, y) \u2212 V (w, y)h \u2212 V (w, y) \u2212 V (h, y) dx\n\n(4.4)\n\n(4.5)\n\n\u03a3\n\nc2 \u2212 c0\n2c2\n\n2\n\nZ\n\necz h2z dx\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n+\necz V (w + h, y) \u2212 V 0 (w, y)h \u2212 V (w, y) \u2212 V (h, y) dx.\n\u2265\n\n\u03a3\n\n\u03a3\n\nStep 2 By Taylor formula, there exist w\u0303 and h\u0303 such that |w\u0303 \u2212 w| < |h| and\n|h\u0303| < |h| such that\nV (w + h, y) \u2212 V 0 (w, y)h \u2212 V (w, y) \u2212 V (h, y)\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 00\n=\nV (w\u0303, y) \u2212 V 00 (h\u0303, y) h2 .\n2\n\n(4.6)\n\nOn the other hand, hypothesis (H2) implies that\n|V 00 (w\u0303, y) \u2212 V 00 (h\u0303, y)| \u2264 C1 |w\u0303 \u2212 h\u0303|\u03b3 ,\n\n(4.7)\n\nfor some C1 > 0.

Suppose first that there exists a non-trivial minimizer of \u03a6c for some\nc = c\u2020 > c0 . Then it is clear that c\u2217 = c\u2020 . Indeed, by [17, Proposition 3.2] and\nthe arguments of [17, Proposition 6.9] we have inf \u03a6c = 0 for every c \u2265 c\u2020 . On\nthe other hand, by [18, Equation (5.4)] we have inf \u03a6c < 0 for all 0 < c < c\u2020 .\nAlternatively, if there is no non-trivial minimizer for any c > c0 , then\ninf \u03a6c = 0 for all c > c0 . Indeed, if not then there exists a trial function\nuc \u2208 Hc1 (\u03a3) with values in [0, 1], such that \u03a6c [uc ] < 0, contradicting nonexistence of minimizers guaranteed by [18, Theorem 3.3]. On the other hand,\narguing as in [18, Theorem 4.2], it is not difficult to see that the trial function\nin [18, Equation (4.18)] makes \u03a6c negative for any 0 < c < c0 .\nThe proof of existence of traveling wave solutions in the statement of Theorem 1 follows from a sequence of propositions below.\nProposition 5.2. Let c > c\u2217 and let w satisfy (W1) \u2013 (W3). Then there exists\n\u016b \u2208 C 2 (\u03a3) \u2229 C 1 (\u03a3) \u2229 W 1,\u221e (\u03a3), with 0 < \u016b < 1, such that\n(i) \u016b solves (1.3) with (1.2).\n(ii) \u016b minimizes \u03a6w\nc [u] over all u taking values in [0, 1] and such that u \u2212 w \u2208\nHc1 (\u03a3).\nProof. By coercivity of \u03a8w\nc established in Proposition 4.3, if (hn ) is a minimizing\n1\n,\nthen\n(h\nsequence from Aw\nn ) is uniformly bounded in Hc (\u03a3). Hence there exists\nc\na subsequence, still labeled (hn ) such that hn * h\u0304 in Hc1 (\u03a3). Moreover, h\u0304 is\nw\nobviously still in Aw\nc . Therefore, by lower-semicontinuity of \u03a8c in the weak\n1\ntopology of Hc (\u03a3) proved in Proposition 4.2, the limit h\u0304 is a minimizer of \u03a8w\nc\nw\nw\nin Aw\nc . Now, since \u03a6c [u] = \u03a8c [u\u2212w], the function \u016b = w+ h\u0304 is also a minimizer\n1\nof \u03a6w\nc over all u, such that 0 \u2264 u \u2264 1 and u \u2212 w \u2208 Hc (\u03a3). This proves part (ii)\nof the statement.\nTo prove part (i), consider the first variation of the functional \u03a6w\nc evaluated\non \u016b with respect to a smooth function \u03c6 with compact support, vanishing at\n\u2202\u03a3\u00b1 . Since \u016b is a minimizer and the barriers u = 0 and u = 1 are sub- and\nsupersolutions of (1.3), we have [24]\nZ\nw\n0 = \u03b4\u03a6c (\u016b, \u03c6) =\necz {\u2207\u016b * \u2207\u03c6 \u2212 f (\u016b, y)\u03c6} dx.\n(5.1)\n\u03a3\n\nBy elliptic regularity theory [23] \u016b is a classical solution of (1.3), and \u016b \u2208\nW 1,\u221e (\u03a3).\nMoreover, we also have \u016b 6\u2261 0, since \u016b = 0 would imply h\u0304 = \u016b \u2212 w = \u2212w \u2208\nHc1 (\u03a3), contradicting our assumptions on w. By strong maximum principle, we\nthen have 0 < \u016b < 1, in view of the fact that u = 0 and u = 1 are the sub- and\nsuper-solutions of (1.3), respectively [18, 23].\nRemark 5.3. We note that the proof of Proposition 5.2 does not rely on the\nprecise details of the assumptions (W1)\u2013(W3) on the function w. The main\ningredient of the proof is that w solves (1.3) and (1.2) and does not lie in Hc1 (\u03a3).\n18\n\n\fTherefore, with a suitable construction of w our approach may also be applied\nto supercritical traveling waves in the case \u03bd0 = 0, yielding existence of traveling\nwave solutions with non-exponential decay.\nIt is not difficult to see that the minimizer constructed in Proposition 5.2 has\nthe decay governed by (2.11). We note that exponential decay of solutions of\n(1.3) in cylindrical domains has been extensively studied under various assumptions on the nonlinearity, etc. (see, for instance, [11, 13]). In particular, with\nminor modifications the arguments of [13] could be applied in our slightly more\ngeneral setting. For the sake of completeness, we present the proof under our\nset of assumptions, using the techniques of [18] and giving a slightly stronger\ndecay estimates. We also note that our result establishes the precise rate of\nexponential decay given by (2.11) for all solutions of (1.3) with c > c\u2217 .\nProposition 5.4. Let c > c\u2217 and let \u016b be a solution of (1.3) and (1.2). Then\n\u016b(y, z)\n\u016bz (y, z)\n\n= ae\u2212\u03bb\u2212 (c,\u03bd0 )z \u03c80 (y)(1 + O(e\u2212\u03b4z )),\n\n(5.2)\n\n= \u2212a\u03bb\u2212 (c, \u03bd0 )e\u2212\u03bb\u2212 (c,\u03bd0 )z \u03c80 (y)(1 + O(e\u2212\u03b4z )),\n\n(5.3)\n\nuniformly in \u03a9 for some a \u2208 R and \u03b4 > 0.\nProof. We reason as in the proof of [18, Theorem 3.3(iii)], recalling that c > c0\nby Proposition 5.1. By a Fourier expansion of (1.3) Rin terms of \u03c8k and \u03bdk from\n(2.7), after some algebra we obtain that ak (z) = \u03a9 \u016b(y, z)\u03c8k (y) dy \u2208 C 2 (R)\nsatisfy\na00k + ca0k \u2212 \u03bdk ak = gk ,\n\n(5.4)\n\nwhere\nZ\n(fu (0, y) \u2212 fu (\u0169(y, z), y))\u016b(y, z)\u03c8k (y)dy,\n\ngk (z) =\n\n(5.5)\n\n\u03a9\n\nfor some 0 < \u0169 < \u016b. Using variation of parameters, for any R \u2208 R we can write\nthe solution of (5.4) in the form\n\u2212\u03bb+ (c,\u03bdk )(z\u2212R)\nak (z) = a+\n+ a\u2212 (R)e\u2212\u03bb\u2212 (c,\u03bdk )(z\u2212R)\nk (R)e\nZ zk\n1\ne\u03bb+ (c,\u03bdk )(\u03be\u2212z) gk (\u03be)d\u03be\n\u2212\u221a 2\nc + 4\u03bdk R\nZ z\n1\n+\u221a 2\ne\u03bb\u2212 (c,\u03bdk )(\u03be\u2212z) gk (\u03be)d\u03be,\nc + 4\u03bdk R\n\n(5.6)\n\nwhere \u03bb\u00b1 are defined in (2.11). Specifically, since \u03c80 > 0 and \u016b > 0, for k = 0\nwe have a0 > 0 and\n|g0 (z)| \u2264 C||u(*, z)||\u03b3L\u221e (\u03a9) a0 (z),\nfor some C > 0.\n19\n\n(5.7)\n\n\fSince \u016b(*, z) \u2192 0 uniformly as z \u2192 +\u221e, by the definition of a0 (z) and (5.7)\nwe have\na0 (z) \u2192 0\n\nand\n\ng0 (z)\n\u21920\na0 (z)\n\nz \u2192 +\u221e.\n\nas\n\n(5.8)\n\nTherefore, by (5.6) for every b0 > 0 there exists R\u03040 \u2208 R, such that for every\nb \u2208 (0, b0 ) and every R0 \u2265 R\u03040 we have\n\u03bb+ (c,\u03bd0 )b\n\u03bb\u2212 (c,\u03bd0 )b\na0 (R0 ) \u2264 a+\n+ a\u2212\n+\n0 (R)e\n0 (R)e\n\n1\nmax a0 (z),\n2 R0 \u2264z\u2264R\n\n(5.9)\n\nwhere R = R0 + b. In fact, the maximum in the last term of (5.9) is attained\nat z = R0 due to monotonic decrease of a0 (z) for all z \u2265 R\u03040 , provided that R\u03040\nis large enough. Indeed, in view of (5.8) we can always choose R\u03040 sufficiently\nlarge, so that maxz\u2265R\u03040 a0 (z) = a0 (R\u03040 ). Then, if a0 (z) is not monotonically\ndecreasing, it attains a local minimum at some z0 \u2208 (R\u03040 , +\u221e). However, by\n(5.4) with k = 0 and (5.8) we have\na000 (z0 ) \u2264 21 \u03bd0 a0 (z0 ) < 0,\n\n(5.10)\n\ncontradicting minimality of a0 (z) at z0 .\nRecalling that b = R \u2212 R0 , the monotonicity of a0 (z) for z \u2265 R\u03040 and the\nestimate in (5.9) imply that for every \u03b5 > 0 there exists b1 > 0 independent of\nR0 , such that\n0\n\n\u2264\n\u2264\n\n1 \u2212\u03bb+ (c,\u03bd0 )b\n\u2212(\u03bb+ (c,\u03bd0 )\u2212\u03bb\u2212 (c,\u03bd0 ))b \u2212\na0 (R)\ne\na0 (R0 ) \u2264 a+\n0 (R) + e\n2\n\u2212\na+\n\u2200R \u2208 [R0 + b1 , R0 + 2b1 ],\n(5.11)\n0 (R) + \u03b5a0 (R)\n\nwhere the last line follows from \u03bb+ (c, \u03bd0 ) > \u03bb\u2212 (c, \u03bd0 ) > 0, choosing b0 large\nenough. Therefore, by (5.6) and, in particular, the fact that a0 (R) = a+\n0 (R) +\na\u2212\n(R)\nwe\nhave\n0\nda0\ndz\n\n=\n\n+\n\u2212\u03bb\u2212 (c, \u03bd0 )a\u2212\n0 (R) \u2212 \u03bb+ (c, \u03bd0 )a0 (R)\n\n\u2264\n\n1\n\u2212 \u03bb\u2212 (c, \u03bd0 )a0 (R) < 0\n2\n\nz=R\n\n\u2200R \u2208 [R0 + b1 , R0 + 2b1 ],(5.12)\n\nprovided that \u03b5 is small enough. Now, in view of arbitrariness of R0 \u2265 R\u03040 ,\nwe conclude that the inequality (5.12) in fact holds for all z \u2265 R1 := R0 + b1 ,\n1\nand so a0 (z) \u2264 a0 (R1 )e\u2212 2 \u03bb\u2212 (c,\u03bd0 )(z\u2212R1 ) for all z \u2265 R1 . Hence, by [18, Eq.\n(4.24)] we have \u016b(*, z) \u2264 Ce\u2212\u03bcz , for some C > 0 and \u03bc > 0. From now on,\nwe can argue exactly as in the proof [18, Theorem 3.3(iii)] to show that either\n\u016b(y, z) = ae\u2212\u03bb\u2212 (c,\u03bd0 )z \u03c80 (y)(1 + e\u2212\u03b4z ) or \u016b(y, z) = ae\u2212\u03bb+ (c,\u03bd0 )z \u03c80 (y)(1 + e\u2212\u03b4z ),\nfor some a > 0 and \u03b4 > 0. Here we took into account that the slightly stronger\nmultiplicative decay estimate than the one obtained in [18] follows from the C 1\nconvergence on slices of \u03a3 for the difference between \u016b and the leading order\nterm in [18, Eq. (3.38)] and the Hopf lemma applied to \u03c80 .\n20\n\n\fTo finish the proof of (5.2), we need to exclude the possibility that the\nexponential decay rate is governed by \u03bb+ (c, \u03bd0 ). Indeed, if the latter were true,\nthen by the above estimates together with similar estimates for |\u2207\u016b| following\nfrom [18, Eq. (3.38)], we find that \u016b \u2208 Hc1 (\u03a3). Therefore, \u016b satisfies hypothesis\n(H3) of [18], implying that there exists a non-trivial minimizer of \u03a6c0 for some\nc0 \u2265 c. Then, by the arguments in the proof of Proposition 5.1, this would imply\nthat c\u2217 \u2265 c0 , thus leading to a contradiction.\nFinally, the estimate for \u016bz in (5.3) is obtained by differentiating (1.3) with\nrespect to z and using the same arguments as for (5.2).\nThus, according to Propositions 5.2 and 5.4 there exist bounded solutions\nof (1.3) and (1.2) with the behavior at z = +\u221e governed by the slowest exponentially decaying positive solution of the respective linearized equation. Now\nwe will establish a number of additional properties of these solutions, based on\nthe minimality of \u03a6w\nc evaluated on \u016b. In particular, we will show that these\nsolutions have the form of advancing fronts.\nProposition 5.5. Let \u016b be as in Proposition 5.2. Then\n(i) \u016b(y, z) is a strictly monotonically decreasing function of z.\n(ii) \u016b(*, z) \u2192 v in C 1 (\u03a9) as z \u2192 \u2212\u221e, where 0 < v \u2264 1 is a critical point of\nE, and E[v] < 0.\nProof. We prove monotonicity by using a monotone decreasing rearrangement\nof \u016b(y, *), following an idea of Heinze [15]. Introducing a new variable \u03b6 = ecz ,\nwe can write the functional \u03a6w\nc as\n\u03a6w\nc [\u016b]\n\n1\n=\nc\n\nZ\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nZ\n\u03a9\n\nc2 \u03b6 2 \u016b2\u03b6\n|\u2207y \u016b|2\n+\n+ V (\u016b, y)\n2\n2\n!\nc2 \u03b6 2 w\u03b62\n|\u2207y w|2\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212 V (w, y) dy d\u03b6.\n2\n2\n\n(5.13)\n\nLet us now perform a one-dimensional monotone decreasing rearrangement of \u016b\nin \u03b6 for y fixed (see [25, Section II.3] for details). If \u016b\u2217 : \u03a3 \u2192 [0, 1] is the result\nof this rearrangement, then \u016b\u2217 (*, z) = \u016b(*, z) for all z \u2265 R, with R sufficiently\nlarge, in view of monotonicity of \u016b guaranteed by (5.3) in Proposition 5.4. As\na consequence, the function \u016b\u2217 belongs to the admissible class for \u03a6w\nc . On the\nother hand, by [26, Proposition 12] and [25, Lemma 2.6 and Remark 2.34] we\nknow \u03a6c [\u016b\u2217 ] < \u03a6c [\u016b], unless \u016b = \u016b\u2217 , contradicting the minimizing property of \u016b.\nThen, by strong maximum principle the minimizer \u016b(y, z) is, in fact, a strictly\ndecreasing function of z. This proves part (i) of the statement.\nOnce the monotonic decrease of \u016b is established, by boundedness of \u016b there\nexists a limit of \u016b(*, z) as z \u2192 \u2212\u221e. The remainder of part (ii) of the statement\nthen follows exactly as in [17, Proposition 6.6 and Corollary 6.7].\n\n21\n\n\f1.0\n\na)\n\nb)\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n0.3\n\nu\n\n-ux\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nu\n\nx\n\nFigure 1: A numerical example of non-uniqueness of fronts (see text for details).\nProof of Theorem 1. The result of parts (i)\u2013(iii) of Theorem 1 follow by combining the results of Propositions 3.1, 5.2, 5.4 and 5.5 and taking into account translational invariance in z, which allows us to consider only small values of a > 0.\nAlso, in (ii) the arguments in the proof of [18, Theorem 3.3] are used to establish\nthe estimate on |\u2207\u016b|. The result of part (iv) follows exactly as in [18, Theorem\n3.3]. To prove part (v), note that if u satisfies (2.3) and u \u2212 w\u0303 \u2208 Hc1 (\u03a3), then\nby the assumption on w\u0303 we have that \u03a6w\u0303\nc [u] is well-defined, and by minimality\nof \u03a6w\nc [\u016b] we have\nw\nw\u0303\nw\nw\u0303\nw\u0303\n\u03a6w\u0303\nc [\u016b] = \u03a6c [\u016b] + \u03a6c [w] \u2264 \u03a6c [u] + \u03a6c [w] \u2264 \u03a6c [u],\n\n(5.14)\n\nwhich proves the claim.\n\n6\n\nGlobal uniqueness of supercritical fronts\n\nLet us now discuss the question whether the obtained traveling wave solutions\nare unique among all traveling waves with speed c, up to translations.\nFirst of all, by Proposition 5.4 all bounded positive solutions of (1.3) and\n(1.2) with c > c\u2217 must have the asymptotic decay specified by (2.11), which is\nthe same decay of the minimizer \u016b of \u03a6w\nc . Using the sliding domains method\nof Berestycki and Nirenberg [27], it is possible to show that any two traveling\nfront solutions sandwiched between two limiting equilibria must coincide up to\ntranslation (see [13, Theorem 5.1]). Therefore, in order to have non-uniqueness,\ntwo different solutions with, say, a = 1 fixed in (3.2), should have different\nlimiting behavior at z = \u2212\u221e.\nExample of non-uniqueness.\nClearly, uniqueness of the traveling front\nsolutions with prescribed exponential decay cannot hold true in general, even\nin dimension one. Let us demonstrate such non-uniqueness by an explicit example. For simplicity, we present a numerical demonstration of existence of two\ntraveling wave solutions with the same value of the velocity c, the result is then\nmade rigorous by applying the Theorems of Sec. 2. Namely, let us consider the\nproblem (1.3) in the one-dimensional setting with the nonlinear term f given\n\n22\n\n\fby\n\u001a\nf (u) =\n\nu(1 \u2212 2u),\n0 \u2264 u < 12 ,\n(2u \u2212 1)(1 \u2212 u)(40u \u2212 21), 12 \u2264 u \u2264 1.\n\n(6.1)\n\nAs can be easily verified, this function satisfies conditions (H1), (H2) and (U).\nOne may expect that for a range of velocities c close to c0 = 2 the problem (1.3)\nwith nonlinearity (6.1) has two traveling front solutions: one connecting u = 0\nand u = 21 , and another connecting u = 0 with u = 1. These two solutions\nfor c = 2.25 are presented in Fig. 1, where Fig. 1(a) shows the traveling wave\nprofiles and Fig. 1(b) shows the corresponding\nportraits. From the exact\n\u0010q phase\n\u0011\ntraveling wave solution u(z) = 43 \u2212 41 tanh\nc\u2020v1\n\n5\n2\n\nz connecting v1 =\n\n1\n2\n\nwith v = 1,\n\n\u221a9\n10\n\n=\nwe find that\n\u2248 2.846 (see Sec. 2 for the details of the notations).\nAlso, by [28, Theorem 5.1] we have c\u2217 = c\u22171 = 2. Therefore, since c\u2020v1 > c\u2217 ,\nthere are two traveling wave solutions with speed c = 2.25 by Remark 2.2, one\nconnecting zero to v1 and the other connecting zero to v. This is what we see\n]\nnumerically\nq in Fig. 1. Note that the value of c from (2.21) is easily found to\n\nbe c] = 127\n5 \u2248 5.04.\nLet us now present some heuristic arguments as to why the solutions of\n(1.3) and (1.2) are expected to be unique for large enough c. Suppose that\nthe nonlinearity f becomes strictly linear for sufficiently small u, i.e. we have\nf (u, y) \u2261 fu (0, y)u for all u \u2264 \u03b4, with some \u03b4 > 0. In this case, clearly, the\ndecay of any positive solution of (3.1) must be precisely\nw(y, z) = ae\u2212\u03bb\u2212 (c,\u03bd0 )z \u03c80 (y) +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u2212\u03bb+ (c,\u03bdk )\na+\n\u03c8k (y),\nke\n\nz \u2265 z0 ,\n\n(6.2)\n\nk=0\n\nfor some z0 \u001d 1. Here we took into account that when \u03bd0 < \u03bdk \u2264 0, if ever,\nwe have \u03bb\u2212 (c, \u03bdk ) < \u03bb\u2212 (c, \u03bd0 ), hence the presence of a term proportional to\ne\u2212\u03bb\u2212 (c,\u03bdk )z \u03c8k (y) would contradict positivity of the solution. Now, fixing the\nvalue of a, one can see that any two solutions of the form (6.2) differ by a\nfunction that lies in Hc1 (\u03a3), since all the terms in the series in (6.2) except\nthe first one decay exponentially with the rate strictly greater than e\u2212cz/2 . On\nthe other hand, it is easy to see that for c > c] , where c] is defined in (2.21),\n1\nthe functional \u03a8w\nc is strictly convex in Hc (\u03a3). Therefore, for every value of a\n]\nand every c > c there exists a unique positive solution of (1.3). This seems\nrather surprising, since, on one hand, uniqueness in this case is a consequence\n]\nof convexity of \u03a8w\nc for c > c , which, in some sense, is dictated by what happens\nin the \"core\" of the traveling front and thus represents a nonlinear feature of the\nproblem. On the other hand, uniqueness also relies on the fact that, regardless\nof the value of c, any two positive solutions with the same asymptotic decay\nhave difference that lies in Hc1 (\u03a3), which is a property of the behavior far ahead\nof the front and represents a linear feature of the problem. From the variational\npoint of view, uniqueness of solution is also rather surprising, since, in view of\nRemark 3.4, there are infinitely many auxiliary functions w that can be used in\n23\n\n\fthe construction the functional \u03a6w\nc and hence, potentially, different minimizers,\ndepending on the choice of w.\nThese heuristic arguments turn out to work in the case of generic nonlinearities in (1.3), with the result stated in Theorem 2. The proof of this theorem\nfollows from a sequence of lemmas below.\nLemma 6.1. We have c] \u2265 c\u2217 .\nProof. First, by the definition of c] we trivially have c] \u2265 c0 . Now, take any\nu \u2208 Hc1] (\u03a3). Then by hypothesis (H2) there exists \u0169 : \u03a3 \u2192 R, with 0 < \u0169 < u,\nsuch that\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n1\n2\n2\nc] z\n|\u2207u| \u2212 fu (\u0169, y)u dx.\n(6.3)\n\u03a6c] [u] =\ne\n2\n\u03a3\nApplying the definitions of q and \u03bd\u03020 in (2.20), and the Poincar\u00e9 inequality [17,\nLemma 2.1], we obtain\nZ\n\u0001\n]\n1\nec z u2z + |\u2207y u|2 \u2212 q(y)u2 dx\n\u03a6c] [u] \u2265\n2 \u03a3\n!\nZ\n]2\n]\n1\nc\n\u2265\nec z\n+ \u03bd\u03020 u2 dx \u2265 0,\n(6.4)\n2 \u03a3\n4\nimplying that by (2.10) we have c\u2217 \u2264 c] .\nLemma 6.2. Let c > c0 and let \u016b1 and \u016b2 be two solutions of (1.3) and (1.2),\nand whose decay at z = +\u221e is given by (5.2). Then \u016b2 \u2212 \u016b1 \u2208 Hc1 (\u03a3).\nProof. Introduce h = \u016b2 \u2212 \u016b1 , which satisfies\n\u2206h + chz + fu (0, y)h = (fu (0, y) \u2212 fu (\u0169, y))h,\n\n(6.5)\n\nfor some \u0169 bounded between \u016b1 and \u016b2 . In view of Proposition 5.4, we have\n0 \u2264 \u0169(y, z) \u2264 min{1, Ce\u2212\u03bb\u2212 (c,\u03bd0 )z },\n\n(6.6)\n\nfor some C > 0 and all (y, z) \u2208 \u03a3.\nNow, let \u03b7 \u2208 C 1 (R) be a cutoff function with the following properties: \u03b7(z)\nis a non-increasing function of z with super-exponential decay at +\u221e, and\n0\n\u03b7(z) = 1 for z \u2264 0. For fixed \u03b5 > 0 and c0 > 0 let us multiply (6.5) with ec z h\u03b7\u03b52 ,\nwhere \u03b7\u03b5 (z) = \u03b7(\u03b5z), and integrate over \u03a3. After a few integrations by parts,\nwe obtain\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n0\nc0 (c0 \u2212 c) 2\nh \u2212 fu (0, y)h2 \u03b7\u03b52 dx\nec z |\u2207h|2 \u2212\n2\n\u03a3\nZ\n\u0001\n0\n+\nec z 2hhz \u03b7\u03b5 \u03b7\u03b50 \u2212 (c0 \u2212 c)h2 \u03b7\u03b5 \u03b7\u03b50 dx\n\u03a3\nZ\n0\n=\nec z (fu (\u0169, y) \u2212 fu (0, y))h2 \u03b7\u03b52 dx,\n(6.7)\n\u03a3\n\n24\n\n\fwhere \u03b7\u03b50 = d\u03b7\u03b5 /dz.\nWe are now going to estimate the different terms appearing in (6.7). Let us\nbegin by noting that by hypothesis (H2) and (6.6) we have |fu (\u0169, y)\u2212fu (0, y)| \u2264\nC|\u0169(y, z)|\u03b3 \u2264 C 0 (1 + e\u03b3\u03bb\u2212 (c,\u03bd0 )z )\u22121 for some C, C 0 > 0 and all (y, z) \u2208 \u03a3.\nTherefore,\nZ\nZ\n0\nc0 z\n2 2\n0\ne (fu (\u0169, y) \u2212 fu (0, y))h \u03b7\u03b5 dx \u2264 C\nec z (1 + e\u03b3\u03bb\u2212 (c,\u03bd0 )z )\u22121 h2 \u03b7\u03b52 dx.

This can be achieved by setting \u03b7(z) = exp(\u2212 12 z 2 ) for z > 0. Indeed,\nconsider the last term in the left-hand side of (6.10).

From our choice of \u03b7, the second integral is over all z \u2265 \u03b1\u03b5\u22122 .\nTherefore, assuming h \u2208 L2c00 (\u03a3) for some c00 \u2208 (0, c0 ), we have\nZ\nZ\nZ \u221e Z\n0\nc0 z 2 0 2\n2\nc0 z 2 2\ne h |\u03b7\u03b5 | dx \u2264 \u03b1\ne h \u03b7\u03b5 dx +\nec z h2 |\u03b7\u03b50 |2 dydz\n\u22122\n\u03a3\n\u03a3\n\u03b1\u03b5\n\u03a9\nZ\nZ\n00\n2\nc0 z 2 2\n\u2264\u03b1\ne h \u03b7\u03b5 dx + C\u03b5\nec z h2 dx,\n(6.12)\n\u03a3\n\n\u03a3\n\nwhere\nC\u03b5 = sup\n\n\u0010\n\n0\n\n00\n\ne(c \u2212c\n\nz\u2265\u03b1\u03b5\u22122\n\n25\n\n)z\n\n\u0011\n|\u03b7\u03b50 (z)|2 .\n\n(6.13)\n\n\fSimilarly,\nZ\ne\n\nc0 z 2\n\nh\n\n\u03b7\u03b5 |\u03b7\u03b50 | dx\n\n\u03a3\n\nZ\n\u2264\u03b1\n\n0\nec z h2 \u03b7\u03b52\n\ndx + \u03b1\n\n\u22121\n\nZ\nC\u03b5\n\n\u03a3\n\n00\n\nec z h2 dx.\n\n(6.14)\n\n\u03a3\n\nTherefore, we can rewrite (6.10) in the following form (also taking (2.9) into\nconsideration)\n!\nZ\n2\nc0\nc20\ncc0\n0\n2\nc0 z\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212 \u03b1|c \u2212 c| \u2212 \u03b1 h2 \u03b7\u03b52 dx\ne\n2\n4\n4\n\u03a3\n!Z\n0\n00\n00\ne(c \u2212c )z\n\u2264 C sup\nec z h2 dx\n\u03b3\u03bb\n(c,\u03bd\n)z\n\u2212\n0\n1+e\nz\u2208R\n\u03a3\n\u0013Z\n\u0012\n0\n00\n|c \u2212 c|\nec z h2 dx,\n(6.15)\n+C\u03b5 1 +\n\u03b1\n\u03a3\nfor some C > 0 independent of \u03b5.\nNow, by an explicit computation, we have\n\u0001\nC\u03b5 = sup \u03b12 \u03b6 2 exp(\u2212\u03b5\u22122 (\u03b12 \u03b6 2 \u2212 (c0 \u2212 c00 )\u03b1\u03b6)) \u2264 \u03b12 ,\n\n(6.16)\n\n\u03b6\u22651\n\nas soon as c0 \u2212 c00 < \u03b1 and \u03b5 is small enough. Introducing the constants\nq\nc\u00b1 = c \u00b1 c2 \u2212 c20 ,\n(6.17)\nand using (6.16), we then find that (6.15) is equivalent to\nZ\nn\noZ\n0\n00\n(c0 \u2212 c\u2212 )(c+ \u2212 c0 ) \u2212 8\u03b1|c \u2212 c0 |\nec z h2 \u03b7\u03b52 dx \u2264 C\nec z h2 dx,\n\u03a3\n\n(6.18)\n\n\u03a3\n\nwith C > 0 independent of \u03b5, whenever c0 \u2212 c00 < \u03b1 \u2264 min(\u03b3\u03bb\u2212 (c, \u03bd0 ), |c0 \u2212 c|)\nand \u03b5 is sufficiently small.\nWe now note that by Proposition 5.4 we have h \u2208 L2c00 (\u03a3) for some c00 \u2208\n(c\u2212 , c+ ). Therefore, we can choose c0 = c00 + 21 \u03b1, with \u03b1 so small that the\nquantity in the curly brackets in (6.18) is positive. Then, passing to the limit\n\u03b5 \u2192 0 in (6.18), by monotone convergence theorem we can conclude that, in\nfact, we have h \u2208 L2c0 (\u03a3). Applying the same argument to (6.7) we find that\nalso h \u2208 Hc10 (\u03a3), with c0 \u2208 (c00 , c+ ). Finally, iterating this argument, we find\nthat\n\u2200c0 < c+ .\n\nh \u2208 Hc10 (\u03a3),\n\n(6.19)\n\nIn particular, h \u2208 Hc1 (\u03a3), which completes the proof.\nw\nLemma 6.3. Let c > c] . Then the functional \u03a8w\nc is strictly convex on Ac .\n\n26\n\n\fProof. First of all, let us point out that due to the presence of the exponential\n1\nweight the functional \u03a8w\nc is not twice continuously differentiable in Hc (\u03a3), so\nthe convexity of the functional cannot be concluded by evaluating the second\nvariation of \u03a8w\nc . Nevertheless, what we will show below is that the functional\n\u03a8w\nis\nstrongly\nconvex [29], i.e., there exists \u03c3 > 0 such that for every h1 , h2 \u2208 Aw\nc\nc\nit holds\n\u03c3\nw\nw\n\u03a8w\n||h2 \u2212 h1 ||2L2c (\u03a3) .\n(6.20)\nc [h2 ] \u2265 \u03a8c [h1 ] + \u03b4\u03a8c (h1 , h2 \u2212 h1 ) +\n2\nIndeed, by hypothesis (H2) we have\n\u03a8w\nc [h2 ]\n\n=\n+\n\nZ\n1\nw\necz |\u2202z (h2 \u2212 h1 )|2 dx\n\u03a8w\n[h\n]\n+\n\u03b4\u03a8\n(h\n,\nh\n\u2212\nh\n)\n+\n1\n1\n2\n1\nc\nc\n2 \u03a3\nZ\n\u0001\n1\necz |\u2207y (h2 \u2212 h1 )|2 \u2212 fu (\u0169, y)(h2 \u2212 h1 )2 dx,\n(6.21)\n2 \u03a3\n\nfor some 0 \u2264 \u0169 \u2264 1. Now, by Poincar\u00e9 inequality [17, Lemma 2.1], we have\nZ\nc2\n1\necz |\u2202z (h2 \u2212 h1 )|2 dx \u2265 ||h2 \u2212 h1 ||2L2c (\u03a3) ,\n(6.22)\n2 \u03a3\n8\nand by the definition of \u03bd\u03020 in (2.20)\nZ\n\u0001\n\u03bd\u03020\n1\necz |\u2207y (h2 \u2212 h1 )|2 \u2212 fu (\u0169, y)(h2 \u2212 h1 )2 dx \u2265 ||h2 \u2212 h1 ||2L2c (\u03a3) . (6.23)\n2 \u03a3\n2\nStrong convexity then follows with \u03c3 = 14 c2 + \u03bd\u03020 > 0, in view of c > c] and\nimplies strict convexity [29, Chapter 12.H\u2217 ].\nProof of Theorem 3. Let \u016b1 and \u016b2 be as in Lemma 6.2. Without loss of generality we may assume that a is sufficiently small in (5.2). Let us define w to be a\nsuitably truncated version of \u016b1 . Then, by hypothesis (H2) the functional \u03a8w\nc is\nof class C 1 and by Lemma 6.3 is also strictly convex on Aw\n.\nThen\nh\n:=\n\u016b\n\u2212\nw\n1\n1\nc\nw\nbelongs to Aw\n.\nIn\nfact,\nthe\nfunction\nh\n:=\n\u016b\n\u2212\nw\nalso\nbelongs\nto\nA\n,\nin\nview\n2\n2\nc\nc\nof Lemma 6.2. On the other hand, since the equivalent functional \u03a6w\nc is also\nstrictly convex, it has at most one critical point. Therefore, since \u016b1 and \u016b2 solve\nthe Euler-Lagrange equation (1.3) for \u03a6w\nc and are, therefore, critical points of\n\u03a6w\n,\nwe\nconclude\nthat\n\u016b\n=\n\u016b\n.\n1\n2\nc\n\n7\n\nGlobal asymptotic stability of fast fronts\n\nWe now investigate the stability properties of traveling wave solutions with\nspeed c > c\u2217 obtained in the preceding sections. Let us point out in the first\nplace that one cannot expect these traveling wave solutions to be stable in\nthe usual sense (say, with respect to small L\u221e perturbations). Indeed, under\nhypotheses (H1), (H2) and (U) a truncation of the traveling wave solution with\nany c > c\u2217 by a cutoff function that vanishes identically for all z \u2265 R \u001d 1 would\n27\n\n\fnot converge to the corresponding traveling wave, but will instead propagate\nwith the asymptotic speed c\u2217 of the critical front [18, Theorem 5.8]. Similarly,\nmodifying the rate of exponential decay in front of the traveling wave solution\nwith speed c > c\u2217 may lead to acceleration or slowdown of the front (see e.g.\n[30\u201332]), or even lead to irregular behavior [33]. Therefore, stability of these\ntraveling wave solutions should be considered with respect to suitable classes of\nperturbations [30,34]. Here we show global stability of the (unique) supercritical\ntraveling waves with c > c] under perturbations lying in the weighted space\nL2c0 (\u03a3) with suitably chosen c0 > 0.\nWe begin with a general existence result for the solutions of (1.1) of the form\nu(y, z, t) = \u016b(y, z \u2212 ct) + w(y, z \u2212 ct, t),\n\n(7.1)\n\nwhere \u016b is given by Theorem 1 with some fixed c > c\u2217 , and w lying in an\nappropriate exponentially weighted space. The function w satisfies the following\nparabolic equation\nwt = \u2206w + cwz + f (\u016b + w, y) \u2212 f (\u016b, y).\n\n(7.2)\n\nEasily adapting [20, Proposition 3.1] (see also [18]), we can obtain the following\nbasic existence and regularity result for the initial value problem associated with\n(7.2):\nProposition 7.1. For any c0 > 0, let w0 \u2208 L2c0 (\u03a3) and let 0 \u2264 \u016b + w \u2264 1. Then\nthere exists a unique solution w \u2208 C \u03b1 ((0, \u221e); Hc20 (\u03a3)) \u2229 C 1,\u03b1 ((0, +\u221e); L2c0 (\u03a3)) \u2229\nC([0, +\u221e); L2c0 (\u03a3)), for all \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1), of (7.2) and the same boundary conditions\nas in (1.2), such that w(x, 0) = w0 (x).\nWe are now in a position to complete the proof of Theorem 3, following the\nmethod introduced in [16].\nProof of Theorem 3. Without loss of generality, we may assume that c0 < 2\u03bb+ (c, \u03bd\u03020 ),\nwhere \u03bb\u00b1 (c, \u03bd) are defined in (2.11). The result in Proposition 7.1 implies that\n0\nwe can multiply (7.2) by ec z w and integrate over \u03a3. Using hypothesis (H2) and\nthe definition of q(y) in (2.20), we have\nZ\nZ\n0\n0\nec z wwt dx \u2264\nec z (\u2206w + cwz \u2212 q(y)w) w dx.\n(7.3)\n\u03a3\n\n\u03a3\n\nThen, after a number of integrations by parts, we obtain\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\nZ\n0\n0\nc0 (c \u2212 c0 ) 2\nd\nec z w2 dx \u2264 \u22122\nec z wz2 +\nw + |\u2207y w|2 \u2212 q(y)w2 dx. (7.4)\ndt \u03a3\n2\n\u03a3\nApplying the Poincar\u00e9 inequality [17, Lemma 2.1] and the definition of \u03bd\u03020 in\n(2.20), we then arrive at\n!Z\nZ\n2\n0\nd\nc0\ncc0\nc0 z 2\ne w dx \u2264 2\n\u2212\n\u2212 \u03bd\u03020\nec z w2 dx\ndt \u03a3\n4\n2\n\u03a3\nZ\n0\n1\n= {c0 \u2212 2\u03bb\u2212 (c, \u03bd\u03020 )}{c0 \u2212 2\u03bb+ (c, \u03bd\u03020 )}\nec z w2 dx.\n(7.5)\n2\n\u03a3\n28\n\n\fTherefore, since c0 \u2208 (2\u03bb\u2212 (c, \u03bd\u03020 ), 2\u03bb+ (c, \u03bd\u03020 )), the coefficient in front of the integral in the right-hand side of (7.5) is negative, which implies exponential decay\nof the L2c0 -norm of w.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe work of PVG was supported, in part, by the United States\u2013Israel Binational\nScience Foundation grant 2006-151.
