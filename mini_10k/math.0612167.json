The chemostat model provides the foundation for much\nof current research in bio-engineering, ecology, and population biology [6,\n8, 10, 11, 21]. In the engineering literature, the chemostat is known as\nthe continuously stirred tank reactor. It has been used for modeling the\ndynamics of interacting organisms in waste water treatment plants, lakes and\noceans. In its basic setting, it describes the dynamics of species competing\nfor one or more limiting nutrients. If there are n species with concentrations\nxi for i = 1, . . . , n and just one limiting nutrient with concentration S and\ndilution rate D > 0, then the model takes the form\n\uf8f1\nn\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u1e60 = D(S \u2212 S) \u2212 X \u03bc (S)x /\u03b3\ni\ni i\nin\ni=1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u1e8bi = xi (\u03bci (S) \u2212 D), i = 1, . . . , n\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bci denotes the per capita growth rate of species i and \u1e57 is the time\nderivative of any variable p. (In much of the paper, we simplify our notation\nby omitting the arguments of the functions. For instance, when no confusion\ncan arise from the context, we denote S(t) simply by S.) The functions \u03bci\ndepend only on the nutrient concentration, and are zero at zero, continuously\ndifferentiable and strictly increasing, although non-monotone functions have\nbeen the subject of research as well. The conversion of nutrient into new\nbiomass for each species i happens with a certain yield \u03b3i \u2208 (0, 1) and the\nnatural control variables in this model are the input nutrient concentration\nSin and the dilution rate D. The latter variable is defined as the ratio of\nthe volumetric flow rate F (with units of volume over time) and the reactor\nvolume Vr which is kept constant. Therefore it is proportional to the speed\nof the pump that supplies the reactor with fresh medium containing the\nnutrient. The equations (1) are then straightforwardly obtained from writing\nthe mass-balance equations for the total amounts of the nutrient and each\nof the species, assuming the reactor content is well-mixed. The full model\n(1) is illustrated in Figure 1.\n\nD\n\nD\nS(t), xi (t)\n\nS0\n\nFigure 1. Chemostat\n\n\fSTABILITY IN THE PERTURBED CHEMOSTAT\n\n3\n\nIn the present work, we consider the case where there is just one species\nwith concentration x, in which case the equations (1) take the form\n(\n\u1e60 = D(Sin \u2212 S) \u2212 \u03bc(S)x/\u03b3\n(2)\n\u1e8b = x(\u03bc(S) \u2212 D)\n(but see Theorem 3 below for results on chemostats with disturbances, and\nSection 8 for models involving several species). We assume Sin is a given\npositive constant, while the per capita growth rate \u03bc is a Monod function\n(which is also known as a Michaelis-Menten function) taking the form\nmS\n,\n(3)\n\u03bc(S) =\na+S\nfor certain positive constants m and a that we specify later. The dilution\nrate is an appropriate continuous positive periodic function we also specify\nbelow. Since \u1e60 \u2265 0 when S > 0 is near zero, one can readily check that (2)\nleaves the domain of interest\nX := (0, \u221e) \u00d7 (0, \u221e)\n\npositively invariant (i.e., trajectories for (2) starting in X remain in X for\nall future times); see Theorem 3 for a more general invariance result for\nperturbed chemostats.\nSince we are taking Sin to be a fixed positive constant, we rescale the\nvariables to reduce the number of parameters. Using the change of variables\nx\nS\n, x\u0304 =\n, \u03bc\u0304(S\u0304) = \u03bc(Sin S\u0304)\nS\u0304 =\nSin\nSin \u03b3\nand dropping bars, we eliminate Sin and \u03b3 and so obtain the new dynamics\n(\n\u1e60 = D(1 \u2212 S) \u2212 \u03bc(S)x\n(4)\n\u1e8b = x(\u03bc(S) \u2212 D)\n\nagain evolving on the state space X = (0, \u221e)2 . Motivated by the realistic\necological situation where the species concentrations are oscillating, we solve\nthe following biological problem:\nBiological Problem B1: For a prescribed oscillatory behavior for\nthe species concentration and substrate level given by a time-periodic\npair (Sr (t), xr (t)), design a dilution rate function D(t) such that if\nthis choice of D(t) is used in the chemostat (4), then all solution pairs\n(S(t), x(t)) for the substrate levels and corresponding species levels\nobtained from solving (4) (i.e. for all possible initial values) closely\napproximate (Sr (t), xr (t)) for large times t.\nSee also Problem (SP) in Section 4 below for a precise mathematical statement of the preceding problem. In the language of control theory, solving\nBiological Problem B1 means we will prove the stability of a suitable periodic reference signal for the species concentration t 7\u2192 xr (t) in (4) using an\nappropriate time-periodic dilution rate D(t); see [15] for the fundamental\nideas from control theory we need in the sequel.\n\n\f4\n\nF. MAZENC, M. MALISOFF AND P. DE LEENHEER\n\nSince D(t) is proportional to the speed of the pump which supplies the\nchemostat with medium containing nutrient, implementation of the prescribed oscillatory behavior requires that we control the pump in a very\nprecise way. In practice this control process is prone to errors, and the actual pump speed will be subject to small fluctuations which we will model\nby replacing D(t) by D(t) + u1 (t) in the chemostat equations, where u1 (t)\nmodels the error. It is therefore of interest to study the effect of these small\nfluctuations on the periodic behavior. Preferably this effect will be small,\nand the resulting behavior is not too different from the prescribed periodic\nbehavior. We will show that this is indeed the case by actually quantifying\nhow small the deviations are, relying on the well-known control-theoretic notion of Input-to-State Stability or ISS; see [23, 24] and Remark 2 for details\nabout ISS. Summarizing this a bit more formally, we will solve the following\nbiological problem (which we state in a more precise mathematical way in\nSection 5):\nBiological Problem B2: For the prescribed oscillatory behavior\n(Sr (t), xr (t)) and dilution rate D(t) obtained in Biological Problem\nB1, quantify how the substrate and species levels (S(t), x(t)) in the\nchemostat model (4) are affected by unexpected changes in the dilution\nrate, and show that the convergence of (S(t), x(t)) to the oscillatory\nbehavior (Sr (t), xr (t)) is robust to small changes in D(t).\nOur solution to Biological Problem B2 will be a special case of our more\ngeneral input-to-state stability result for the chemostat tracking equations,\nassuming the dilution rate and initial concentration are both perturbed by\nnoise terms of small enough magnitude.\nIn the next section, we briefly review the literature focusing on what\nmakes our approach different. In Section 3, we fix the reference signal we\nwish to track. In Section 4, we precisely formulate the definitions and the\nstability problem we are solving. We state our main stability theorem in\nSection 5 and we discuss the significance of our theorem in Section 6. We\nprove our stability result in Section 7. In Section 8, we show that the stability\nis maintained when there are additional species that are being driven to\nextinction. We validate our results in Section 9 using a numerical example.\nWe conclude in Section 10 by summarizing our findings.\n2. Review of the Literature and Comparison with Our Results.\nThe behavior of the system (1) is well understood when Sin and D are\npositive constants, as well as cases where n = 2 and either of these control\nvariables is held fixed while the other is periodically time-varying. See [13,\n20] for periodic variation of Sin and [4] for periodic variation of D and the\ngeneral reference [21] on chemostats. When both Sin and D are constants,\nthe so-called \"competitive exclusion principle\" holds, meaning that at most\none species survives. Mathematically this translates into the statement that\nsystem (1) has a steady state with at most one nonzero species concentration,\nwhich attracts almost all solutions; see [21]. This result has triggered much\n\n\fSTABILITY IN THE PERTURBED CHEMOSTAT\n\n5\n\nresearch to explain the discrepancy between the (theoretical) competitive\nexclusion principle and the observation that in real ecological systems, many\nspecies coexist.\nThe results on the periodically-varying chemostat mentioned above should\nbe seen as attempts to explain this paradox. They involve chemostats with\nn = 2 species, and their purpose is to show that an appropriate periodic\nforcing for either Sin (t) or D(t) can make the species coexist, usually in the\nform of a (positive) periodic solution. Few results on coexistence of n > 2\nspecies are available. An exception is [19], where a periodic function Sin (t)\nis designed (with D kept fixed) so that the resulting system has a (positive)\nperiodic solution with an arbitrary number of coexisting periodically varying\nspecies. The stability properties of this solution are not known.\nMore recent work has explored the use of state-dependent but time invariant feedback control of the dilution rate D to generate coexistence; see [6, 8]\nfor monotone growth rate functions in the n = 2 species case, and [7] for\nthe n = 3 species case. The paper [11] considers feedback control when the\ngrowth rate functions are non-monotone. In [12], [16], and [18], coexistence\nis proved for models taking into account intra-specific competition. In these\nmodels, the usual growth functions \u03bci (S) are replaced by functions \u03bci (S, xi )\nwhich are decreasing with respect to the variable xi . All the results discussed\nso far apply to a more general model than (4) involving n > 1 species. This\nis because the main purpose of these papers is to investigate environmental\nconditions under which the competitive exclusion principle fails and several\nspecies can coexist.\nHere we will not consider any coexistence problems. Our main objective\nis to provide a proof of stability of a periodic solution based on a Lyapunovtype analysis and to investigate the robustness properties of the periodic\nsolution with respect to perturbations. As an illustration we show that the\nstability of the periodic solution is robust with respect to additional species\nthat are being driven to extinction, or to small disturbances on the initial\nnutrient concentration or dilution rate. These features set our work apart\nfrom the known results on periodically forced chemostat models which do\nnot rely on the construction of a Lyapunov function. Proving stability in\nthe chemostat usually relies on reduction and monotonicity arguments, and\nnot so often on Lyapunov functions (but see for instance Theorem 4.1 in [21]\nwhich uses a Lyapunov function introduced in [14] and more recently [12]).\nFinally we point out that closely related to our results is [10] where a\nsingle-species chemostat with a continuous and bounded (but otherwise arbitrary) function Sin (t) and constant dilution rate is investigated; there it is\nshown that two positive solutions converge to each other. However, the proof\nis not based on a Lyapunov function. The advantage of having a Lyapunov\nfunction is that it can be used to quantify the effect of additional noise terms\non the stability of the unperturbed dynamics. In fact, to our knowledge, our\nwork provides the first input-to-state stability analysis of chemostats whose\ndilution rates and initial concentrations are perturbed by small noise; see\n\n\f6\n\nF. MAZENC, M. MALISOFF AND P. DE LEENHEER\n\nRemark 2 for a discussion on the importance of input-to-state stability in\ncontrol theory and engineering applications.\n3. Choosing a Reference Trajectory.

We wish to solve\nthe following stability problem which is merely a restatement of Biological\nProblem B1 above in precise control theoretic terms:\n(SP)\n\nGiven any trajectory (S, x) : [0, \u221e) \u2192 (0, \u221e)2 for (4) corresponding to the dilution rate D(t) from (7) and \u03bc as in (5) (i.e. for\nany initial value for (S, x)), show that the corresponding deviation\n(S\u0303(t), x\u0303(t)) := (S(t)\u2212Sr (t), x(t)\u2212xr (t)) of (S, x) from the reference\ntrajectory (6) asymptotically approaches (0, 0) as t \u2192 +\u221e.\n\nWe will solve (SP) by proving a far more general tracking result for a\nsingle species chemostat acted on by a disturbance vector u = (u1 , u2 ) :\n[0, \u221e) \u2192 R2 as follows:\n(\n\u1e60(t) = [D(t) + u1 (t)](1 + u2 (t) \u2212 S(t)) \u2212 \u03bc(S(t))x(t)\n.\n(9)\n\u1e8b(t) = x(t)[\u03bc(S(t)) \u2212 D(t) \u2212 u1 (t)]\n\nWe will quantify the extent to which the reference trajectory (6) tracks the\ntrajectories of (9) which will solve Biological Problem B2 from the introduction. To this end, we need to introduce a priori bounds on u1 and u2 ;\nsee Remark 8. Our main theoretical tool will be the input-to-state stability\n(ISS) property [22] which is one of the central paradigms of current research\nin nonlinear stability analysis; see Remark 2. The relevant definitions are\nas follows.\nWe let K\u221e denote the set of all continuous functions \u03b3 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 [0, \u221e)\nfor which (i) \u03b3(0) = 0 and (ii) \u03b3 is strictly increasing and unbounded. We let\nKL denote the class of all continuous functions \u03b2 : [0, \u221e) \u00d7 [0, \u221e) \u2192 [0, \u221e)\nfor which (I) \u03b2(*, t) \u2208 K\u221e for each t \u2265 0, (II) \u03b2(s, *) is non-increasing for\neach s \u2265 0, and (III) \u03b2(s, t) \u2192 0 as t \u2192 +\u221e for each s \u2265 0. Consider a\ngeneral control-affine dynamic\n\u1e8f = F (y, t) + G(y, t)u, y \u2208 O, u \u2208 U\n\n(10)\n\nevolving on a given subset O \u2286 Rn where U is a given subset of Euclidean\nspace. (Later we specialize to dynamics for the chemostat.) For each to \u2265 0\nand yo \u2208 O, let y(t; to , yo , \u03b1) denote the solution of (10) satisfying y(to ) = yo\nfor a given control function \u03b1 \u2208 U := {measurable essentially bounded \u03b1 :\n[0, \u221e) \u2192 U}; i.e. the solution of the initial value problem\n\u1e8f(t) = F (y(t), t) + G(y(t), t)\u03b1(t) a.e. t \u2265 to , y(to ) = yo .\nWe always assume that such solutions are uniquely defined on all of [to , \u221e)\n(i.e., (10) is forward complete and O is positively invariant for this system) and that there exists \u0398 \u2208 K\u221e such that |F (y, t)| + |G(y, t)| \u2264 \u0398(|y|)\neverywhere, where | * | is the usual Euclidean norm. For example,\n[to , \u221e) \u220b t 7\u2192 (S(t; to , (So , xo ), \u03b1), x(t; to , (So , xo ), \u03b1))\nis the solution of (9) for the disturbance u = (u1 , u2 ) = \u03b1(t) satisfying the\ninitial condition (S(to ), x(to )) = (So , xo ).\n\n\f8\n\nF. MAZENC, M. MALISOFF AND P. DE LEENHEER\n\nDefinition 1. We call (10) input-to-state stable (ISS) provided there exist\n\u03b2 \u2208 KL and \u03b3 \u2208 K\u221e such that\n|y(t; to , yo , \u03b1)| \u2264 \u03b2(|yo |, t \u2212 to ) + \u03b3(|\u03b1|\u221e )\n\n(11)\n\nfor all t \u2265 to , to \u2265 0, yo \u2208 O, and \u03b1 \u2208 U .\n\nHere |\u03b1|\u221e denotes the essential supremum of \u03b1 \u2208 U . By causality, the ISS\ncondition (11) is unchanged if |\u03b1|\u221e is replaced by the essential supremum\n|\u03b1|[to ,t] of \u03b1 restricted to [to , t]. In particular, (11) says y(t; to , yo , Z) \u2192 0\nas t \u2192 +\u221e for all initial values yo and initial times to , where Z is the zero\ndisturbance \u03b1(t) \u2261 0.\nRemark 2. The theory of ISS systems originated in [22]. ISS theory provides the foundation for much current research in robustness analysis and\ncontroller design for nonlinear systems, and has also been used extensively in\nengineering and other applications [1, 2, 5, 17, 22, 24]. The ISS approach can\nbe viewed as a unification of the operator approach of Zames (e.g. [25, 26])\nand the Lyapunov state space approach. The operator approach involves\nstudying the mapping (to , yo , \u03b1) 7\u2192 y(*; to , yo , \u03b1) of initial data and control\nfunctions into appropriate spaces of trajectories, and it has the advantages\nthat it allows the use of Hilbert or Banach space techniques to generalize\nmany properties of linear systems to nonlinear dynamics. By contrast, the\nstate space approach is well suited to nonlinear dynamics and lends itself to\nthe use of topological or geometric ideas. The ISS framework has the advantages of both of these approaches including an equivalent characterization\nin terms of the existence of suitable Lyapunov-like functions; see Remark 7\nbelow. For a comprehensive survey on many recent advances in ISS theory\nincluding its extension to systems with outputs, see [24].\nTo specify the bound \u016b on our disturbances u = (u1 , u2 ), we use the\nfollowing constants whose formulas will be justified by the proof of our main\nstability result:\no\n\u00112\nn\n\u0010\n16m(4a+3)(a+2)\n,\n,\nc = 8 21 + DD\u0304o , \u03ba = 4 + max 112m\n4a+1\na(4a+1)2\nn\no\n(12)\n\u03ba\nma\nC1 = min 1, 200\n, 2(4a+3)(a+2)\n\n5. Statement of Theorem. From now on, we assume the disturbance\nvector u = (u1 , u2 ) in (9) takes all of its values in a fixed square control set\nof the form\nU := {(u1 , u2 ) \u2208 R2 : |u1 | \u2264 \u016b, |u2 | \u2264 \u016b} where\n)\n(\nDo\nC1\n,\n0 < \u016b < min p\n8(1 + 2c\u03baC1 ) 2\n\n(13)\n\nwhere c, \u03ba, and C1 are in (12) (but see Remark 8 for related results under less\nstringent conditions on the disturbance values). We will prove the following\nrobustness result:\n\n\fSTABILITY IN THE PERTURBED CHEMOSTAT\n\n9\n\nTheorem 3. Choose D(t), \u03bc, and (Sr , xr ) as in (5)-(7). Then the corresponding solutions of (9) satisfy\n[ S o > 0 & xo > 0 & t \u2265 t o \u2265 0 & \u03b1 \u2208 U ]\n\u21d2\n\n[ S(t; t0 , (S0 , x0 ), \u03b1) > 0 & x(t; t0 , (S0 , x0 ), \u03b1) > 0 ] .\n\n(14)\n\nMoreover, there exist \u03b2 \u2208 KL and \u03b3 \u2208 K\u221e such that the corresponding\ntransformed error vector\ny(t; to , yo , \u03b1) :=\n(S(t; t0 , (S0 , x0 ), \u03b1) \u2212 Sr (t), ln(x(t; t0 , (S0 , x0 ), \u03b1)) \u2212 ln(xr (t)))\nsatisfies the ISS estimate (11) for all \u03b1 \u2208 U , t0 \u2265 0, t \u2265 t0 , S0 > 0, and\nx0 > 0, where yo = (S0 , x0 ).\n6. Discussion on Theorem 3. Before proving the theorem, we discuss\nthe motivations for its assumptions, and we interpret its conclusions from\nboth the control theoretic and biological viewpoints.\nRemark 4. Condition (14) says (0, \u221e)2 is positively invariant for (9). One\nmay also prove that [0, \u221e)2 is positively invariant for (9), as follows. Suppose the contrary. Fix to \u2265 0, xo \u2265 0, So \u2265 0, and \u03b1 \u2208 U for which the corresponding trajectory (S(t), x(t)) for (9) satisfying (S(to ), x(to )) = (So , xo )\nexits [0, \u221e)2 in finite time. This provides a finite constant t1 := max{t\u0303 \u2265\nto : (S(t), x(t)) \u2208 [0, \u221e)2 \u2200t \u2208 [to , t\u0303]}. Then S(t1 ) = 0, since otherwise\nS(t1 ) > 0 and x(t) = 0 for all t \u2265 t1 and then we could use the continuity of\nS to contradict the maximality of t1 . Since \u016b < min{1, Do /2}, the continuity\nof S and x and the fact that S(t1 ) = 0 provide a constant \u03b5 > 0 such that\n1 + u2 (t) \u2212 S(t) \u2265 (1 \u2212 \u016b)/2 and \u03bc(S(t))x(t) \u2264 Do (1 \u2212 \u016b)/8 for (almost)\nall t \u2208 [t1 , t1 + \u03b5], hence also \u1e60(t) \u2265 Do (1 \u2212 \u016b)/8 > 0 for all t \u2208 [t1 , t1 + \u03b5]\n(since D(t) + u1 (t) \u2265 Do /2 everywhere). Hence, S(t) > S(t1 ) = 0 for\nall t \u2208 [t1 , t1 + \u03b5]. Since x(t) clearly stays in [0, \u221e), this contradicts the\nmaximality of t1 . The positive invariance of [0, \u221e)2 follows.\nRemark 5. Theorem 3 says that in terms of the error signals y, any componentwise positive trajectory of the unperturbed chemostat dynamics (9)\nconverges to the nominal trajectory (6), uniformly with respect to initial\nconditions. This corresponds to putting \u03b1 \u2261 0 in (11). It also provides the\nadditional desirable robustness property that for an arbitrary U-valued control function \u03b1 \u2208 U , the trajectories of the perturbed chemostat dynamics\n(9) are \"not far\" from (6) for large values of time. In other words, they\n\"almost\" track (6) with a small overflow \u03b3(|\u03b1|\u221e ) from the ISS inequality\n(11). Similar results can be shown for general choices of xr and D(t). For\nexample, we can choose any xr (t) that admits a constant l > 0 such that\nmax{l, |\u1e8br (t)|} \u2264 xr (t) \u2264\n\n3\n4\n\n\f10\n\nF. MAZENC, M. MALISOFF AND P. DE LEENHEER\n\nfor all t \u2265 0 and Sr = 1 \u2212 xr . In this case, we take the dilution rate\nD(t) = \u2212\n\n\u1e8br (t)\n+ \u03bc(1 \u2212 xr (t)),\nxr (t)\n\nwhich is again uniformly bounded above and below by positive constants. The\nproof of this more general result is similar to the proof of Theorem 3 we give\nbelow except with different choices of the constants c and \u03ba.\nRemark 6. The robustness result\n| (S(t; t0 , (S0 , x0 ), \u03b1) \u2212 Sr (t), ln(x(t; t0 , (S0 , x0 ), \u03b1)) \u2212 ln(xr (t))) |\n\u2264 \u03b2(|(S0 , x0 )|, t \u2212 t0 ) + \u03b3(|\u03b1|[t0 ,t] )\n\n(15)\n\nof Theorem 3 differs from the classical ISS condition in the following ways:\n1. For biological reasons, negative values of the nutrient level S and the\nspecies level x do not make physical sense. Hence, only componentwise\npositive solutions are of interest. Therefore, (15) is not valid for all\n(S0 , x0 ) \u2208 R2 but rather only for (S0 , x0 ) \u2208 (0, \u221e) \u00d7 (0, \u221e).\n2. Our condition (15) provides an estimate on the transformed error component ln(x(t; t0 , (S0 , x0 ), \u03b1)) \u2212 ln(xr (t)) instead of the more standard\nerror x(t; t0 , (S0 , x0 ), \u03b1) \u2212 xr (t). Our reasons for using the transformed\nform of the error are as follows. The function ln(x) goes to \u2212\u221e\nwhen x goes to zero. This property is relevant from a biological point\nof view. Indeed, in the study of biological systems, it is important\nto know if the concentration of the species is above a strictly positive constant when the time is sufficiently large or if the concentration admits zero in its omega limit set. In the first case, the species\nis called persistent. The persistency property is frequently desirable,\nand it is essential to know whether it is satisfied. Hence, the function\nln(x(t; t0 , (S0 , x0 ), \u03b1)) \u2212 ln(xr (t)) has the desirable properties that (a)\nit goes to +\u221e if x(t; t0 , (S0 , x0 ), \u03b1) does, (b) it is equal to zero when\nx(t; t0 , (S0 , x0 ), u) is equal at time t to the value of xr , and (c) it goes\nto \u2212\u221e if x(t; t0 , (S0 , x0 ), u) goes to zero. Therefore, roughly speaking,\nif the species faces extinction, then it warns us.\nRemark 7. Our proof of Theorem 3 is based on a Lyapunov type analysis.\nRecall that a C 1 function V : Rn \u00d7[0, \u221e) \u2192 [0, \u221e) is called an ISS Lyapunov\nfunction (ISS-LF) for (10) provided there exist \u03b31 , \u03b32 , \u03b33 , \u03b34 \u2208 K\u221e such that\n1. \u03b31 (|y|) \u2264 V (y, t) \u2264 \u03b32 (|y|) and\n2. Vt (y, t) + Vy (y, t)[F (y, t) + G(y, t)u] \u2264 \u2212\u03b33 (|y|) + \u03b34 (|u|)\nhold for all y \u2208 O, t \u2265 0, and u \u2208 U. The function V we will construct in\nthe proof of Theorem 3 is not an ISS-LF for the chemostat error dynamics\nbecause of the specificities of the state space, which preclude the existence of\nthe necessary functions \u03b31 , \u03b32 \u2208 K\u221e in Condition 1 above. Hence, we cannot directly apply the result that the existence of an ISS Lyapunov function\nimplies that the system is ISS e.g. [9, Theorem 1] to prove our theorem.\nInstead, we prove our Theorem 3 directly from the decay inequality satisfied\n\n\fSTABILITY IN THE PERTURBED CHEMOSTAT\n\n11\n\nby the time derivative of V along the trajectories. The proof that the decay\ninequality implies ISS is very similar to that part of the proof of [9, Theorem\n1], so we only sketch that part of our proof in the appendix.\nRemark 8. Our estimate (15) would not hold if we had instead chosen the\nfull control set U = R2 . In fact, taking the disturbance \u03b1 \u2261 (u1 , u2 ) =\n(0, \u22121) and any initial condition (S(to ), x(to )) = (S0 , xo ) \u2208 (0, \u221e)2 in (9)\nwould give S(t; t0 , (S0 , x0 ), \u03b1) \u2192 0 and so also ln(x(t; t0 , (S0 , x0 ), \u03b1))) \u2192\n\u2212\u221e as t \u2192 +\u221e (since |u1 (t)| \u2264 \u016b < Do /2 \u2264 D(t)/2 almost everywhere).\nTherefore extinction would occur and (15) would not be satisfied. On the\nother hand, if our set U is replaced by U\u266f := [\u2212\u016b, +\u016b]2 for any fixed constant\n\u016b \u2208 (0, min{1, Do }), then the chemostat error dynamics instead satisfies the\nless stringent integral ISS property; see Remark 9 below for details.\n7. Proof of Theorem 3. The proof of (14) is immediate from the structure\nof the dynamics (9) and the fact that \u016b < 1 (which imply that \u1e60 \u2265 0 when\nS > 0 is sufficiently small); see Remark 4 for a similar argument. It remains\nto prove the ISS estimate (15) for suitable functions \u03b2 \u2208 KL and \u03b3 \u2208 K\u221e .\nThroughout the proof, all (in)equalities should be understood to hold\nglobally unless otherwise indicated. Also, we repeatedly use the simple\n\"(generalized) triangle inequality\" relation\n1 2\nq\n(16)\n4d\nfor various choices of p \u2265 0, q \u2265 0, and d > 0 that we specify later.\nFix to \u2265 0, So > 0, xo > 0, and \u03b1 \u2208 U , and let [to , \u221e) \u220b t 7\u2192 (S(t), x(t))\ndenote the corresponding solution of (9) satisfying (S(t0 ), x(to )) = (So , xo ).\nFor simplicity, we write \u03b1(t) as (u1 , u2 ), omitting the time argument as\nbefore. We first write the error equation for the variables\npq \u2264 dp2 +\n\n(z\u0303, \u03be\u0303) = (z \u2212 zr , \u03be \u2212 \u03ber )\n\n(17)\n\nwhere \u03be = ln x, z = S + x, zr (t) = Sr (t) + xr (t) = 1, and \u03ber (t) = ln xr (t).\nOne easily checks that\n\u017c(t) = [D(t) + u1 (t)][1 + u2 (t) \u2212 z(t)]\n\u1e8b(t) = x(t)[\u03bc(z(t) \u2212 x(t)) \u2212 D(t) \u2212 u1 (t)] .\nTherefore, since zr \u2261 1 (which implies \u017cr (t) = [D(t) + u1 (t)][1 \u2212 zr (t)]), our\nformula (5) for \u03bc immediately implies that the (transformed) error\n \u0303\n(z\u0303, \u03be)(t)\n= (z(t) \u2212 zr (t), ln x(t) \u2212 ln xr (t))\nsatisfies the chemostat error dynamics\n\uf8f1\n \u0307\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 z\u0303 = \u2212[D(t) + u1 (t)][z\u0303 \u2212 u2 (t)]\nz\u0303 \u2212 e\u03ber (t) (e\u03be\u0303 \u2212 1)\n\uf8f4 \u03be \u0303 \u0307 = ma\n\uf8f3\n\u2212 u1 (t).\n(a + z \u2212 e\u03be )(a + zr (t) \u2212 e\u03ber (t) )\n\n(18)\n\n\f12\n\nF.

Condition (32) is the classical ISS Lyapunov function decay condition for the transformed error dynamics evolving on our\nrestricted state space. Therefore, a slight variant of the classical ISS arguments combined with (32) give the ISS estimate asserted by Theorem 3. For\ndetails, see the appendix below. This concludes the proof.\nRemark 9. If our control set U is replaced by the larger control set U\u266f :=\n[\u2212\u016b, +\u016b]2 for any fixed constant \u016b \u2208 (0, min{1, Do }), then the error dynamics (18) instead satisfies the less stringent integral ISS property. The relevant definitions are as follows. We say that (10) is integral input-to-state\nstable (iISS) provided there exist \u03b41 , \u03b42 \u2208 K\u221e and \u03b2 \u2208 KL such that\nZ t+to\n\u03b42 (|\u03b1(r)|)dr\n(iISS)\n\u03b41 (|y(t; to , yo , \u03b1)|) \u2264 \u03b2(|yo |, t \u2212 to ) +\nto\n\neverywhere for all measurable essentially bounded functions \u03b1 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 U\u266f .\nThis condition is less restrictive than ISS since e.g. \u1e8f = \u2212 arctan(y) + u is\niISS but not ISS [3]. An iISS-LF for (10) (with controls in U\u266f ) is then\ndefined to be a C 1 function V : Rn \u00d7 [0, \u221e) \u2192 [0, \u221e) for which there are\n\u03b31 , \u03b32 , \u03b34 \u2208 K\u221e and a positive definite function \u03b33 (i.e., \u03b33 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 [0, \u221e)\nis continuous and zero only at zero) such that Conditions 1-2 in Remark 7\nhold everywhere. This is less restrictive than the ISS-LF condition since \u03b33\nneed not be of class K\u221e . Arguing as in the proof of Theorem 3 up through\n(28) and solving the appropriate constrained minimum problem to get \u03b33\nshows that V = L3 satisfies the iISS Lyapunov function decay condition\n(namely, Condition 2 from Remark 7) for the error dynamics (18) and the\ncontrol set U\u266f using \u03b33 (s) = C1 (e\u2212s \u2212 1)2 /2. Therefore, this system is in\nfact iISS, by a slight variant of the proof of the iISS estimate in [3, Theorem\n1]. We leave the details to the reader.\n8. Stability in the Presence of Several Species. Theorem 3 shows\nthat the stability of the reference trajectory (6) is robust with respect to\nsmall perturbations of the dilution rate and initial concentration. To further\ndemonstrate the robustness of our results, we next show that the stability of\n(6) is also maintained when the model (4) is augmented to include additional\nspecies that are being driven to extinction, in the following sense.\nWe assume for simplicity that u1 \u2261 u2 \u2261 0.

The variables yi represent the levels of n additional\nspecies. We choose D and Do as in (7) and (8), and we assume \u03bdi (1) < Do\nfor i = 1, 2, . . . , n. (This assumption is, in a sense, natural because one can\neasily check that it ensures that each species concentration yi converges to\nzero. Indeed, the fact that, for all t \u2265 0, D(t) > Do > 0 and \u03bc(S(t))x(t) +\nP\nn\ni=1 \u03bdi (S(t))yi (t) \u2265 0 ensures, in combination with the inequalities \u03bdi (1) <\nDo , that there exists an instant T > 0 and a constant c > 0 such that for all\nt \u2265 T and for i = 1, 2, . . . , n, \u1e8fi (t) \u2264 \u2212cyi (t).

However, such an argument would not be technically correct, since the\nstate space of (35) is not Rn+2 (because the original augmented chemostat\nmodel (33) is only defined for componentwise nonnegative values of the\nstate). Instead, we argue as follows (in which we may assume for simplicity\nthat the initial time for the augmented error dynamics is zero).\n\n\fSTABILITY IN THE PERTURBED CHEMOSTAT\n\n17\n\nFor any t \u2265 0, integrating the last inequality of (39) over [0, t] gives\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n \u0303\n \u0303 y(t) \u2212 L4 z\u0303(0), \u03be(0),\ny(0)\nL4 z\u0303(t), \u03be(t),\nZ t \u0010\n\u0011\n(40)\nM \u03be\u0303(l), z\u0303(l), y(l) dl .\n\u2264\u2212\n0\n\nIt follows that, for all t \u2265 0,\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011\n \u0303\ny(0) .\nL1 \u03be\u0303(t)\n\u2264 L4 z\u0303(0), \u03be(0),\n\n(41)\n\nTherefore \u03be(t) = \u03be\u0303(t) + \u03ber (t) is a bounded function. Similarly, z\u0303(t) and y(t)\nare bounded. We deduce that \u03be\u0303, z\u0303, and the components of y are uniformly\ncontinuous, since their time derivatives (35) are bounded. Reapplying (40)\ntherefore implies\nZ\n+\u221e\n\nM (\u03be\u0303(l), z\u0303(l), y(l))dl\n\n0\n\nis finite. It follows from Barbalat's lemma [15, p.323] and the structure of\nthe function M that (\u03be\u0303(t), z\u0303(t), y(t)) \u2192 0 as t \u2192 +\u221e. This establishes our\nstability condition for the multi-species model.\nRemark 10. Notice that \u2212L\u03074 is bounded below by a quadratic of the form\nc\u0304|(\u03be\u0303, z\u0303, y)|2 along the trajectories of (35), and that L4 is bounded above and\nbelow by such quadratics along the trajectories as well, since the trajectories\nare bounded. From this fact and (39), one can deduce that the trajectories\n(\u03be\u0303(t), z\u0303(t), y(t)) converge exponentially to zero.\n\n9. Simulation. To validate our convergence result, we simulated the dynamics (9) with the initial values x(0) = 2 and S(0) = 1 and the reference\ntrajectory xr (t), using the parameters m = 10 and a = 21 and to = 0. In this\ncase, the lower bound on D(t) provided by (8) is Do = 7/3. It follows from\nRemark 9 that the convergence of x(t) to xr (t) is robust to disturbances that\nare valued in [\u2212\u016b, \u016b]2 for any positive constant \u016b < min{1, Do } = 1, in the\nsense of integral input-to-state stability. Moreover, using the estimate (28),\none easily checks that in this case, estimate (iISS) on p.14 above holds with\n\u03b42 (r) = 2C2 r; cf. the proof of [3, Theorem 1]. For our simulation, we took\nthe disturbance u1 (t) = 0.5e\u2212t on the dilution rate and u2 (t) \u2261 0. This gave\nthe plot of x(t) and xr (t) against time in Figure 3. Our simulation shows\nthat the state trajectory x(t) closely tracks the reference trajectory xr (t)\neven in the presence of small disturbances and so validates our findings.\n10. Conclusions. The chemostat model is a useful framework for modeling\nspecies competing for nutrients. For the case of one species competing for\none nutrient and a suitable time-varying dilution rate, we proved stability of\nan appropriate reference trajectory. Moreover, we found that the stability\nwas maintained even if the model is augmented with other species that are\nbeing driven to extinction, or if there are disturbances of appropriately small\nmagnitude acting on the dilution rate and input nutrient concentration.\n\n\f18\n\nF.
