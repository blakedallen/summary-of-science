Introduction\nIn this theoretical study we model the occurrence frequency distributions and\nassociated correlations of parameters observed in solar flare hard X-rays (Paper\nI; Aschwanden 2010a) using the concept of self-organized criticality (for a recent textbook, see Aschwanden, 2010b). The concept of self-organized criticality\n(SOC) has been pioneered by Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld (1987), which they\nbriefly summarize in their abstract: \"We show that certain extended dissipative\nSolar and Astrophysics Laboratory, Lockheed Martin\nAdvanced Technology Center, Dept. ADBS, Bldg.252, 3251\nHanover St., Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA; (e-mail:\naschwanden@lmsal.com)\n\nSOLA: ms2.tex; 29 October 2018; 23:04; p. 1\n\n\fM. Aschwanden\n\ndynamical systems naturally evolve into a critical state, with no characteristic\ntime or length scales. The temporal \"fingerprint\" of the self-organized critical\nstate is the presence of 1/f noise; its spatial signature is the emergence of scaleinvariant (fractal) structure.\" A consequence of the scale-invariant structure is\nthe manifestation of powerlaw-like distributions of spatial, temporal, and energy\nparameters, which became the observational hallmark of SOC processes.\nAn interpretation of the omnipresent powerlaw distributions of solar-flare\npeak fluxes or energies in terms of SOC models was first proposed by Lu and\nHamilton (1991), which they summarize as follows: \"The solar coronal magnetic\nfield is proposed to be in a self-organized critical state, thus explaining the\nobserved power-law dependence of solar-flare-occurrence rate on flare size which\nextends over more than five orders of magnitude in peak flux. The physical\npicture that arises is that solar flares are avalanches of many small reconnection\nevents, analogous to avalanches of sand in the models published by Bak and\ncolleagues in 1987 and 1988. Flares of all sizes are manifestations of the same\nphysical processes, where the size of a given flare is determined by the number\nof elementary reconnection events. The relation between small-scale processes\nand the statistics of global-flare properties which follows from the self-organized\nmagnetic-field configuration provides a way to learn about the physics of the\nunobservable small-scale reconnection processes. A simple lattice-reconnection\nmodel is presented which is consistent with the observed flare statistics.\" The\nlattice-based computer simulations of next-neighbor interactions is known as\ncellular automaton model and represents a powerful numerical model that can\nreproduce many observed distributions of SOC processes (e.g. , see review by\nCharbonneau et al. 2001).\nAn alternative approach to cellular automaton models of SOC processes are\nanalytical models, which also can reproduce the observed statistical distributions\nand scaling laws between observed parameters, which we pursue here.\n\n2. Analytical SOC Model\nA simple analytical model of SOC processes with universal applicability can be\nconstructed from the concept of a nonlinear process that: (i) has a multiplicative\nor exponential growth phase, (ii) is randomly interrupted, and (iii) has a linear\ndecay phase. The basic evolution of such a dissipative nonlinear process with\navalanche-like characteristics is depicted in Figure 1.\nThe exponential-growth model with conditions (i) and (ii), which constrains\na powerlaw distribution of event sizes, goes back to Willis and Yule (1922),\nwho applied it to geographical distributions of plants and animals. According\nto Simkin and Roychowdhury (2006), Yule's model was re-invented by Fermi\n(1949), who applied it to the origin of cosmic rays, and by Huberman and Adamic\n(1999), who applied it to the growth dynamics of the World-Wide Web. In the\nastrophysical context, it was applied to cosmic ray and solar flare transients by\nRosner and Vaiana (1978). However, the waiting time between subsequent events\nwas interpreted as energy storage time of the exponential energy build-up phase\n\nSOLA: ms2.tex; 29 October 2018; 23:04; p. 2\n\n\fSelf-Organized Criticality\n\nWS\n\nW0\nt0\n\ntS\n\ntE\n\ntS\n\n\u03c4D\n\nD\nT\n\nFigure 1. Schematic of the temporal evolution of an avalanche event, consisting of (i) a rise\ntime (tS ) with exponential growth of the energy release W (t) from a threshold level W0 to the\nsaturation level WS , and (ii) a decay time (D) with a constant decay rate \u03b7 = dW/dt = W0 /\u03c4D .\n\nin the model of Rosner and Vaiana (1978), which was not confirmed observationally (Lu, 1995; Crosby, 1996; Wheatland, 2000; Georgoulis et al. 2001). The\nlack of a correlation between waiting times and flare size is not surprising in the\nconcept of SOC models. The original SOC model of Bak et al. (1987) assumes\nthat avalanches occur randomly in time and space without any correlation, and\nthus a waiting time interval between two subsequent avalanches refers to two\ndifferent and independent locations (except for sympathetic flares), and thus\nbears no information on the amount of energy that is released in each spatially\nseparated avalanche. In an alternative model, the exponential rise time tS is\nassumed to be related directly to the energy release process of an instability\nduring a flare (Aschwanden et al. 1998), rather than to the much longer energy\nstorage time assumed in Rosner and Vaiana (1978).\nFor the decay process of the instability, a linear decay is found approximately\nto reproduce the observed scaling laws between flare peak counts and flare durations (Aschwanden 2010b), which constitutes assumption (iii) of our analytical\nmodel. The physical implication of a linear decay is a constant decay rate after\nthe saturation of the instability, independent of the size of the event. This linear\ndecay assumption (iii) has been added to our model mostly on empirical grounds.\nTests with cellular automaton models could corroborate its reality.\nLet us now formulate this analytical SOC model in mathematical terms. A full\nderivation of the exponential-growth model is given in Section 3.1 of Aschwanden\n(2010b). We define the temporal evolution of the energy release rate W (t) of a\nnonlinear process that starts at a threshold energy of W0 with an exponential\ngrowth time \u03c4G . The process grows exponentially until it saturates at time t = tS\nwith a saturation energy WS ,\nWS = W (t = tS ) = W0 exp\n\n\u0012\n\ntS\n\u03c4G\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(1)\n\nSOLA: ms2.tex; 29 October 2018; 23:04; p. 3\n\n\fM.

The model implies also a sharp correlation between\nthe parameters P, E, and T (Equation 14), which of course is an idealization\nthat is not realistic, as the scatterplots between the parameters demonstrate in\nFigure 4 (of Paper I). A more realistic model can be constructed by introducing\na distribution of values for the instability threshold level W0 and the decay time\nconstant \u03c4D , which are assumed to be constant (or \u03b4-functions) in our basic\nmodel. However, our basic model can be treated analytically and yields physical\ninsights into SOC distributions. A generalization to a more realistic model (in\nthe next Section) requires numerical simulations.\n\nSOLA: ms2.tex; 29 October 2018; 23:04; p. 6\n\n\fSelf-Organized Criticality\n\n3. Randomized Exponential-Growth SOC Model\nIn addition to the three conditions of our basic exponential-growth model (Section 2), we add now also a randomization of instability threshold energies W1\n(with a mean of W0 ), which might better reproduce the scatter between observed\nparameters. It is a necessary condition that the critical threshold of a SOC\nsystem contains a large number of metastable states that are close to becoming\nunstable, which may be best described by some sort of a random distribution,\nwhich we have to choose empirically due to the lack of a comprehensive SOC\ntheory. For a random distribution of threshold energies W1 we may assume\na normal or a log-normal (Gaussian) distribution. Since a normal distribution\nwith a positive mean energy W0 contains also negative values W1 < 0, which\nare unphysical in our model, we choose a log-normal distribution N (W1 ), which\ncontains by definition only positive values,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n[log(W1 ) \u2212 log(W0 )]2\n.\n(15)\nN (W1 ) \u221d exp \u2212\n2\n2\u03c3W\nDrawing threshold values W1 from such a log-normal distribution and random\nsaturation times tS from a random Poisson distribution (approximated by an\nexponential function, Equation 3), the resulting saturation energies WS have\nalso a large spread,\n\u0012 \u0013\ntS\n.\n(16)\nWS = W1 exp\n\u03c4G\nIn addition, we add also a randomization of decay times tD , parameterized with a\nPoisson distribution and approximated by a normalized exponential distribution,\n\u0013\n\u0012\ntD\nN0\ndtD .\n(17)\nexp \u2212\nN (tD )dtD =\n\u03c4D\n\u03c4D\nwhere tD are individual decay times and \u03c4D is the e-folding time constant. The\nphysical units of the variables \u03c4G , tS , and tD are all time units (i.e. , seconds).\nBased on the random distributions of the values for threshold energies W1\n(obtained from Equation 15), saturation times tS (Equation 3), and decay times\ntD (Equation 17), we can then obtain for each parameter combination the peak\ncounts P (with Equation 2),\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013\ntS\n\u22121 ,\n(18)\nP = W0 exp\n\u03c4G\nthe decay time D (with Equation 6),\nD = tD\n\n\u0012\n\nP\nW0\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(19)\n\nthe total flare duration (Equation 8),\nT = tS + D ,\n\n(20)\n\nSOLA: ms2.tex; 29 October 2018; 23:04; p. 7\n\n\fM.

We obtain a good match with the observed\ndistributions (Figure 4, righ-hand panels, or Figures 1 \u2013 3 in Paper I), with\nslopes of \u03b1P \u2248 1.71 \u00b1 0.04 (vs. RHESSI: 1.73 \u00b1 0.04), \u03b1E \u2248 1.53 \u00b1 0.03 (vs.\nRHESSI: 1.57 \u00b1 0.03), and \u03b1T \u2248 2.24 \u00b1 0.06 (vs. RHESSI: 2.28 \u00b1 0.06), for the\nfollowing model constants: \u03c4S = 1.0, \u03c4G = 1.5, \u03c4D = 1.0, W0 = 4, and \u03c3W = 1.5.\nNote also that the simulated frequency distributions N (P ), N (E), and N (T ) all\nexhibit a roll-over at the lower end of the distributions.\nThe scatterplots between the three variables P , E, and T are shown in Figure\n4, which also display a comparable scatter as observed in the data, with similar\nlinear regression fits as observed, i.e., E \u221d P 1.39 (vs. RHESSI: E \u221d P 1.31 ),\nD \u221d P 1.01 (vs. RHESSI: D \u221d P 0.90 ), and E \u221d D1.90 (vs. RHESSI: E \u221d D1.76 ).\nThus, we conclude that this model provides more realistic occurrence frequency distributions and parameter correlations than the idealized model with\na fixed threshold level W0 and decay time \u03c4D .\n4. Discussion and Conclusions\nThe paramount interpretation of the powerlaw shape of frequency distributions\nof solar flare parameters is the state of self-organized criticality of a dissipative\nsystem (Lu and Hamilton, 1991). This model predicts scale-free distributions\nof the size parameters of flare events, such as temporal, spatial, and energy\nparameters. We measured durations, peak values, and time-integrated values of\nhard X-ray photon counts, which serve as a good proxy of the flare duration,\npeak energy release rate, and total released flare energies, based on the thicktarget bremsstrahlung flare model (Brown, 1971) and the correlations found\nbetween these parameters (Crosby et al. 1993). The detailed functional shape\nof the resulting frequency distributions and the scatterplots of the correlated\nparameters have been modeled with cellular automaton models before (e.g. Lu\nand Hamilton etal 1991).\nA basic model based on multiplicative nonlinear processes (with exponential\ngrowth), random saturation times, and linear decay (Section 2) predicts an exact\npowerlaw function at the upper end of all frequency distributions, with a rollover\nat the lower end (Figure 2). However, the predicted relationships between the\npowerlaw slopes, \u03b1P = \u03b1T and \u03b1E = (\u03b1P + 1)/2, do not agree with the observations (i.e. , <\n\u223c 20%) within the accuracy of the measured powerlaw slopes\n\nSOLA: ms2.tex; 29 October 2018; 23:04; p. 10\n\n\fSelf-Organized Criticality\n\n2.0\nPowerlaw slope \u03b1P(t)\n\nVar =0.08\n\n1.9\n1.8\n1.7\n1.6\n1.5\n0.0\n\nGrowth time \u03c4G(t)\n\n3\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n0.6\nTime t\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.7\n1.6\n1.5\n0.0\n8\n\n1\n\n0\n0.0\n\n1.8\n\nVar = 0.38\n\n2\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n0.6\nTime t\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nVar=0.09\n\n1.9\n\nThreshold energy W1\n\nPowerlaw slope \u03b1P(t)\n\n2.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n0.6\nTime t\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n0.4\n0.6\nTime t\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nVar=0.26\n\n6\n4\n2\n0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\nFigure 5. Monte-Carlo simulations of a variation of the powerlaw slope of flare peak fluxes\nby 8% (top), which can be caused by a variation of the growth time \u03c4G by 38% (bottom left)\nor by a variation of the mean threshold energy by 26% (bottom right).\n\n(<\n\u223c 5%). Also the predicted correlation between the parameters does not allow\nfor any scatter, in strong contrast to the observed datapoints.\nWe develop a more realistic SOC model with randomized parameters (of the\nthreshold levels, saturation times, and decay times), which is able to reproduce closely the powerlaw slopes of the observed frequency distributions and\nthe scatter between correlated parameters. This randomized exponential-growth\nSOC model predicts different relationships between the powerlaw slopes than the\nidealized one, which cannot be calculated analytically without approximations,\nbut can easily be generated with numerical (Monte-Carlo) simulations.\nIn Paper I we discovered a systematic modulation of the powerlaw slope of\nthe frequency distributions of solar flares during three solar cycles, which implies\nalso a modulation of the physical conditions in solar flare sites. A possible coupling could occur between the solar dynamo and the magnetic complexity in the\nsolar photosphere, chromosphere, and corona that leads to magnetic instabilities\nresulting into flares. The detailed relationship between magnetic complexity and\nmultiplicative chain reactions that occur in a SOC system depends on specific\nphysical models such as magnetic reconnection scenarios. In terms of our analytical SOC model, the powerlaw slope of flare frequency distributions can\nbe modulated by the ratio of growth to saturation times (\u03b1P = 1 + \u03c4G /\u03c4S ;\nEq. 5), which can be driven by longer growth times \u03c4G in magnetically more\ncomplex regions during high solar activity periods. A Monte-Carlo simulation\nshows that a variation of the mean instability growth time by 38% is required\nto induce a modulation of the powerlaw slope by 8% (Figure 5 left), as observed\n\nSOLA: ms2.tex; 29 October 2018; 23:04; p. 11\n\n\fM.

Alternatively, the mean threshold energy W1 could be larger\nin magnetically unstable regions during high solar activity periods. A MonteCarlo simulation shows that a change of the mean threshold energy by 26% can\nexplain the observed powerlaw slope variation of 8% (Figure 5 top). A higher\nthreshold could be obtained by stronger magnetic stressing during the solar cycle\nmaximum. Thus, detailed forward-fitting of our analytical SOC model to the\nobserved distributions in various active regions and in specific time intervals of\nthe solar cycle could diagnose the physical conditions of magnetic configurations,\nwhich provides important information for statistical flare forecasting.\nAcknowledgements We thank the referee Brian Dennis for constructive and\nhelpful comments.
