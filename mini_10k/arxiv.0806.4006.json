In the framework of a recently developed formalism with variable brane tension one can\npose the question, whether it was always that high? In analogy with fluid membranes, in this paper\nwe allow for temperature dependent brane tension, according to the corresponding law established\nby E\u00f6tv\u00f6s. For cosmological branes this assumption leads to several immediate consequences: (a)\nThe brane Universe was created at a finite temperature Tc and scale factor amin . (b) Both the brane\ntension and the 4-dimensional gravitational coupling 'constant' increase with the scale factor from\nzero to asymptotic values. (c) The 4-dimensional cosmological 'constant' evolves with a, starting\nwith a huge negative value, passing through zero, finally reaching a small positive value. Such a\nscale\u2013factor dependent cosmological constant is able to generate a surplus of attraction at small a\n(as dark matter does) and a late-time repulsion at large a (dark energy). In the particular toy model\ndiscussed here the evolution of the brane tension is compensated by energy interchange between the\nbrane and the fifth dimension, such that the continuity equation holds for the cosmological fluid.\nThe resulting cosmology closely mimics the standard model at late times, a decelerated phase being\nfollowed by an accelerated expansion. The energy absorption of the brane drives the 5D space-time\ntowards maximal symmetry, becoming Anti de Sitter.\n\nI.\n\nTF\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nPhysics aims for a unified description of nature, tracing\nback all physical laws to four fundamental interactions.\nWhile three of them are quantized, and to certain extent\nfurther unified, gravity is still best described classically.\nIn contrast with the rest of the interactions about evolving fields on a flat background, gravity is perceived as the\ndynamics of geometry. String theory attempts to unify\nall interactions on different grounds, its basic objects being open or closed strings and higher-dimensional objects,\ncalled branes. The co-dimension one brane-world theory\n(generalizing the early Randall-Sundrum model [1]) carries the original geometric spirit of general relativity, incorporating arbitrary curvature and matter (for a review\nsee [2]). The extra dimension is both non-compact and\ncurved (the remaining dimensions required by string and\nM-theory can still be thought as compactified). Gravity acts in 5-dimensions according to Einstein's equae while\ntion with a negative cosmological constant e\n\u03ba2 \u039b,\nstandard model fields are confined to the brane, a timeevolving 3-dimensional space-like hypersurface.\nThe projection of the 5-dimensional (5D) Einstein\nequation onto the brane gives an effective Einstein equation, which in the most generic case reads [3]\nTF\n\nGab = \u2212\u039bgab + \u03ba2 Tab + \u03ba\ne4 Sab \u2212 E ab + Lab + P ab , (1)\n\nwith Tab , the brane energy-momentum tensor; Sab , a\nquadratic expression in Tab ; and E ab , the electric part\nof the 5D Weyl tensor with respect to the brane normal\n[4], averaged over the two sides of the brane.

The 4-dimensional (4D) and 5D\ngravitational coupling constants \u03ba2 and \u03ba\ne2 are related as\n2\n4\n6\u03ba = \u03ba\ne \u03bb, with \u03bb the brane tension. The 4D cosmological 'constant' \u039b, apart from contributions of the asymmetric embedding and non-standard model 5D fields, is\ne\ndefined as 2\u039b0 = \u03ba2 \u03bb + \u03ba\ne2 \u039b.\nReference [3] gives the most generalic form of the gravitational dynamics involving asymmetric embedding [5]\nand non-static 5d space-time due to radiation fields [6][15]. Besides cosmological applications in branes embedded into 5d black-hole space-times [16]-[17] or into\ntheir horizon regions [18]-[19] other aspects of braneworld models have been discussed, including black-hole\nbrane-worlds [20]-[22], gravitational collapse on the brane\n[23]-[28], stellar models [29]-[31], galactic dynamics [32],\nthe dynamics of clusters of galaxies [33], light deflection\n[34], [35] and Solar System tests [36].\n\nA classical fluid membrane needs tension to exist. Similarly its higher dimensional counterpart, the 3-brane, as\nit evolves, remains a hypersurface due to the brane tension. The strongest bound on the minimal value of \u03bb was\nderived by combining the results of table-top experiments\non possible deviations from Newton's law, which probe\ngravity at sub-millimeter scales [37] with the known value\nof the 4D Planck constant. In the 2-brane model [38] this\ngives [11] \u03bb > 138.59 TeV4 . A much milder limit \u03bb & 1\nMeV4 arises from the constraint that the dominance of\nSab ends before the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN)\n[39]. From astrophysical considerations on brane neutron stars an intermediate value \u03bb > 5 \u00d7 108 MeV4 was\nderived [29]. (All these limiting values are for c = 1 = ~.\nIn units c = 1 = G the corresponding minimal values\nof the brane tension are \u03bbtabletop = 4. 2 \u00d7 10\u2212119 eV\u22122 ,\n\n\f2\n\u03bbBBN = 3\u00d710\u2212145 eV\u22122 and \u03bbastro = 1.5 \u00d710\u2212136 eV\u22122 ,\nrespectively [28].) For typical stellar densities the condition \u03c1star /\u03bb \u226a 1 is obeyed with any of these bounds.\nIn a cosmological context the brane represents our observable Universe. Cosmic expansion is realized through\nthe movement of the brane in the warped extra dimension. During cosmological evolution the temperature of\nthe brane changes drastically. Cosmological branes cool\ndown from a very hot early Universe (whose thermal radiation is able to create a black hole in the fifth dimension\n[6]), to the present days low temperature of the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB).\nIn Sec. II we explore the possibility of a variable brane\ntension, discussed in detail in Ref. [40], by introducing a\ntoy model, in which the brane tension literally follows the\ntemperature dependence of the fluid tensions established\nfor membranes. Such a model becomes particularly simple when we assume the continuity equation. We discuss\nthe emerging cosmological model in Sec. III. A numerical\nsolution of this toy-model, which is compatible with cosmological observations is presented in Sec. IV. Finally,\nSec. V contains the concluding remarks.\nThroughout the paper we follow the notations of Ref.\n[40].\n\nFIG. 1: (color online).

The tension of classical membranes depends on temperature, according to\nE\u00f6tv\u00f6s' law [41]\n\u03bbf luid = K (Tc \u2212 T ) ,\n\n(2)\n\nK being a constant and Tc a critical temperature representing the highest temperature for which the membrane\nexists.\nMotivated by this analogy, the covariant gravitational\ndynamics on the brane was analyzed in detail for variable tension brane-worlds, with the brane asymetrically\nembedded into the 5d space-time, both the latter and\nthe brane containing arbitrary sources [40]. After establishing the covariant dynamics on the brane in a generic\nsetup, a specialization to a cosmological situation was\npresented, considering a Friedmann brane asymmetrically embedded into a 5d space-time containing radiation.\nAs a first attempt to discuss in more detail the consequences of a temperature-dependent brane tension, we\nadopt E\u00f6tv\u00f6s' law\n\u03bb = \u03bblt \u2212\n\n6l\n,\n\u03ba\ne4 a\n\n(3)\n\nwhere we have employed the standard relation T \u221d a\u22121 .\nWe have also denoted KTc = \u03bblt and written the constant\n\n(4)\n\nwith\n\u03ba2lt =\n\nII.\n\nl\n,\na\n\n\u03ba\ne4 \u03bblt\n.\n6\n\n(5)\n\nThe subscript lt refers to late-time, as the second terms\nof both \u03bb and \u03ba2 go to zero with a \u2192 \u221e.\nSuch a brane with temperature-dependent tension cannot exist below the scale-factor amin = l/\u03ba2lt first because\nthe tension would become negative, leading to the destruction of the brane and secondly, because the gravitational 'constant' would also become negative below this\nlimit, leading to anti-gravity on the brane. In terms of\namin the 4D coupling 'constant' and the brane tension\ncan be conveniently expressed as\n\u0010\namin \u0011\n\u03ba2 = \u03ba2lt 1 \u2212\n,\n(6)\na \u0011\n\u0010\namin\n\u03bb = \u03bblt 1 \u2212\n.\n(7)\na\nBoth increase from zero to their asymptotic late-time values (Fig 1). We also note that\n\u03ba\ne4 =\n\n6\u03ba2\n6\u03ba2\n= lt .\n\u03bb\n\u03bblt\n\n(8)\n\nAs the brane tension increases with scale factor according to the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s law, we may call this model an E\u00f6tv\u00f6s\nbrane-world. The limits derived for the brane-world tension from nucleosynthesis constraints in the case of an\nE\u00f6tv\u00f6s brane refer to the value of the brane tension at the\ntime of nucleosynthesis, and in consequence its presentday value is higher than for constant tension branes.\nThe \u039b0 contribution to the 4D cosmological 'constant'\nevolves cf.\namin \u0010\namin \u0011\n\u039b0 = \u039blt \u2212 \u03ba2lt \u03bblt\n1\u2212\n,\n(9)\na\n2a\n\n\f3\nIII.\n\nFIG. 2: (color online).

[42]: (a) brane-world effects for an E\u00f6tv\u00f6s brane\nare more dominant then for a constant tension brane, due\nto the initial smallness of the brane tension (this also\nimplies that the typical brane-world source term \u03c12 /\u03bb,\narising from Sab , dominates for a longer time); (b) due\nto the initial smallness of \u03ba2 , gravity is initially quite\nweak; and (c) the huge negative value of the cosmological\nconstant generates an apparent gravitational attraction.\ne\nIn order to have a small \u039blt , the values of \u03bblt and \u039b\nhave to be almost perfectly fine-tuned. As the astrophysical lower limit refers to \u03bblt , we can safely assume the\nusual high negative value for the 5D cosmological cone In consequence the initial 4D cosmological\nstant \u03ba\ne2 \u039b.\nconstant \u039bc and its late-time value \u039blt obey \u2212\u039bc \u226b \u039blt .\nTherefore the 4D cosmological 'constant' at early times\nrepresents a huge contribution in the balance of sources.\n\u039bc = \u039blt \u2212\n\nCOSMOLOGY\n\nAccording to the Stefan-Boltzmann law the energy\ndensity of the CMB (which defines the temperature T )\nis proportional to the fourth power of T , and further,\naccording to the assumption T \u221d a\u22121 , to a\u22124 . This is\npossible only if the continuity equation holds.\nDue to the variable brane tension and possible existence of a non-standard model energy-momentum tensor\nTecd in the fifth dimension, the energy density of the cosmological fluid however obeys a more sophisticated balance equation [40]:\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0227\n\u03c1\u0307 + 3 (\u03c1 + p) = \u2212\u03bb\u0307 + \u2206 uc nd Tecd .\na\n\n(13)\n\nHere u is the 4-velocity of the fluid flow-lines, \u2206 denotes\nthe difference taken on the right and left sides of the\nbrane, while a dot represents the derivative with respect\nto cosmological time \u03c4 . Note that the normal vectors on\nthe two sides of the brane are nR = n and nL = \u2212n,\ntherefore the second term on the right hand side of Eq.\n(13) can be non-vanishing even in the symmetric case.\nIn order to have a continuity equation on the brane, thus\nthe condition\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03bb\u0307 = \u2206 uc nd Tecd\n(14)\n\nshould hold. For an expanding (collapsing)\nuniverse \u03bb\u0307 =\n\u0011\n\u0010\nc de\n(d\u03bb/da) \u0227 > 0 (< 0), therefore \u2206 u n Tcd > 0 (< 0)\nas well, corresponding to a brane absorbing energy from\n(radiating energy into) the 5D space-time.\nAny 5D radiation field (in the geometrical optics approximation) has non-vanishing projection uc nd Tecd [3],\nsuch that\n\u0011\n\u0010\nX\n3\n\u01ebI (\u22121)\u03b7I \u03b2I v\u0307I2\n(15)\n\u2206 uc nd Tecd = 2 3\n\u03ba\ne a\nI=L,R\n\nat the location of the brane r = a.

The 5D space-time is Vaidya-Anti de\nSitter (VAdS5), with line element\nde\ns2 = \u2212f (v, r) dv 2 + 2\u01ebdvdr\n\u0001\u0003\n\u0002\n+r2 d\u03c72 + \u03c72 d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere for a spatially flat brane\nf (v, r) = \u2212\n\ne\ne2 \u039b\n2m (v) \u03ba\n\u2212\nr2 .\nr2\n6\n\n(18)\n\nThe radiation is ingoing (towards r = 0) for \u01eb = 1 and\noutgoing for \u01eb = \u22121, while \u03b7 takes the value 1 if the region\n\n\f4\ncontains r = 0, and 0 otherwise. (The null coordinate v\nis outgoing for \u01eb = 1 and ingoing for \u01eb = \u22121.) Therefore,\nfor an energy-absorbing brane the following combinations\nare allowed: (\u03b7 = 1, \u01eb = \u22121) and (\u03b7 = 0, \u01eb = 1), thus\n\u03b7\n(\u22121) \u01eb = 1, while for a radiating brane either (\u03b7 = 1, \u01eb =\n1) or (\u03b7 = 0, \u01eb = \u22121) hold, thus (\u22121)\u03b7 \u01eb = \u22121. The\nderivatives v\u0307 and \u1e59 are related as [40]\n\u00011/2\n\u03b7+1\nf v\u0307 = \u01eb\u1e59 + (\u22121)\n\u1e592 + f\n,\n(19)\n\u03b7+1\n\nthe sign of v\u0307 being given by (\u22121) . From Eqs.

For a brane in the f > 0\nregion Eq. (22) implies \u1e41\u0227 < 0. Indeed, the brane should\nabsorb (emit) radiation during expansion (contraction),\nand in consequence the mass of the bounded 5D region\ndecreases (increases).

Due to the\nenergy absorption of the brane the mass of the VAdS5\nregion decreases (Fig 4). For the chosen parameters at\napproximately three times the time when the dominance\nof \u039blt over matter begins, the mass m (\u03c4 ) will reach zero.\nWith no mass left, the VAdS5 regions reduce to patches\nof 5D Anti de Sitter (AdS5) space-time and the expansion\non the brane continues in a de Sitter phase.\n\nparticular model discussed here, assuming the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s law\nfor the temperature dependence of the brane tension,\nbalanced by the energy interchange between the brane\nand VAdS5 (such that the continuity equation holds),\nresulted in a monotonic increase with scale factor of the\nbrane tension, gravitational coupling constant and 4D\ncosmological constant. In the early universe both the\nbrane tension and the 4D gravitational coupling constant\nare small, enhancing the dominance of brane-world effects. The temperature-dependent 4D cosmological constant, being negative for small values of the scale factor,\ncontributes to mutual attraction, while positive for large\na, generates dark energy type repulsion.\nWe established the range of the model parameters allowed by the confrontation with observations, given by\nEqs. (28)-(31). A particular configuration obeying these\nconditions, with R = 1025 , x0 = 1011 , y0 = 1034 was represented on Figs 3, 4. For the allowed range the evolution\nof the fundamental constants basically occur in the very\nearly universe preceding BBN, after which they asymptote to constant values. Still, feeded by absorbed energy\nfrom the VAdS5 regions, they slightly evolve. This process eventually will consume m (\u03c4 ), leaving maximally\nsymmetric AdS5 space-time patches on the two sides of\nthe brane. which further expands in a de Sitter phase.\n\nVI.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe variation of the brane tension introduces an additional degree of freedom in brane-world models.
