According to it,\nthe violation of such fundamental symmetries follows\nfrom the observation that the vacuum solution of the\ntheory could spontaneously violate the Lorentz and CPT\ninvariance, even though them are preserved by the underlying theory. Modern tests for Lorentz and CPT invariance breakdown have been discussed in [7]. Recently,\nthe SME has been extended to incorporate the gravitational interaction. Such studies have been formalized by\nKosteleck\u00fd and Bluhm in the papers [1, 8].\nThis paper concerns a cosmological aspect of the SME\nwith gravity related to the so called gravitational baryogenesis. The origin of the the baryon number asymmetry\nis an open issue of the modern Cosmology and particle\nphysics. Measurements of CMB combined with the large\nstructure of the Universe [9], as well as predictions of BigBang Nucleosynthesis [10] give indications that matter in\nthe Universe is dominant over antimatter. The order of\nB\u0304\n. 9 10\u221211 ,\nmagnitude of such a asymmetry is \u03b7 = nB \u2212n\ns\nwhere nB (nB\u0304 ) is the baryon (antibaryon) number density, and s the entropy of the Universe. Conventionally,\nit is argued that to generate (dynamically) the baryon\nasymmetry from an initial symmetric phase the following requirements are necessary [11]: 1) baryon number\nprocesses violating in particle interactions; 2) C and CP\nviolation in order that processes generating B are more\nrapid with respect to B\u0304; 3) out of the equilibrium: since\nmB = mB\u0304 , as follows from CP T symmetry, the equilibrium space phase density of particles and antiparticles\nare the same. To maintain the number of baryon and\nanti-baryon different, i.e. nB 6= nB\u0304 , the reaction should\nfreeze out before particles and antiparticles achieve the\nthermodynamical equilibrium. However, a dynamically\nviolation of CPT allows to generate the baryon number\nasymmetry also in regime of thermal equilibrium [12]. A\n\nnew mechanism to generate the baryon number asymmetry during the expansion of the Universe has been proposed by Davoudiasl et al. [13]. In this mechanism the\nthermal equilibrium is maintained and CPT (and CP)\nsymmetry is dynamically broken. The interaction is described by a coupling between the derivative of the Ricci\nscalar curvature R and the baryon current J \u03bc [14]\nZ\n\u221a\n1\n(1)\nd4 x \u2212gJ \u03bc \u2202\u03bc R ,\nM\u22172\nwhere M\u2217 is the cutoff scale characterizing the effective\ntheory. The operator (1) may arise from Supergravity\ntheories from a higher dimensional operator [15].\nA net baryon asymmetry can be generated in thermal equilibrium provided that there exist interactions violating the baryon number B. Such an asymmetry gets\nfrozen-in after the decoupling temperature TD [16]. Since\nthe scalar curvature only depends on cosmic time, the effective chemical potential for baryons following from Eq.\n(1) is \u03bcB = \u1e58/M\u22172 (for antibaryon one has \u03bcB\u0304 = \u2212\u03bcB ).\nIn the regime T \u226b mB , the net baryon number density\nat the equilibrium is given by nB = gb \u03bcB T 2 /6. Here gb\nrepresents the number of intrinsic degrees of freedom of\nbaryons. The baryon number to entropy ratio evaluated\nat the decoupling, leads to [13]\nnB\n15gg \u1e58(tD )\n,\n\u2243\u2212 2\ns\n4\u03c0 g\u2217 M\u22172 TD\n\n(2)\n\nwhere tD is the decoupling time, s = 2\u03c0 2 g\u2217s T 3 /45, the\ndot stands for the derivative with respect to the cosmic\ntime, and g\u2217s counts the total degrees of freedom for particles that contribute to the entropy of the Universe. The\nlatter assumes values close to the total degrees of freedom\nof effective massless particles g\u2217 [17] (g\u2217s \u2243 g\u2217 \u223c 106).\nIn order that nB /s 6= 0, a nonvanishing time derivative\nof the Ricci scalar is required. Einstein's field equations\nimply R = \u22128\u03c0GTg = \u22128\u03c0G(1 \u2212 3w)\u03c1, where Tg is trace\nof the energy-momentum tensor of matter Tg\u03bc\u03bd , \u03c1 is the\nmatter density, w = p/\u03c1 with p the pressure. In the\nradiation dominated epoch of the standard Friedman-\n\n\f2\nRobertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology, the constant w assumes the value (in the limit of exact conformal symmetry) w = 1/3, so that the time derivative of the Ricci\nscalar is zero, as well as nB /s. Differently to Einstein's\ntheory of gravity, a net baryon asymmetry may be generated during the radiation era by Lorentz violating terms\nwhich couple to Ricci's and Riemann's tensors (for other\nscenarios see Refs. [13, 18], and Refs. [19] for the case\nin which baryon current couples to scalar fields). Corrections induced by Lorentz and CPT violation also affects\nthe baryon current J \u03bc in (1). Nevertheless the latter can\nbe neglected since they give rise to corrections of the second order. We note that the effects on baryogenesis of\nspontaneous CPT violation in a string inspired scenario\nhas been studied by Bertolami et al. [20] (see also [21]).\nThe SME with the inclusion of gravitational interactions [22] foresees that the effective\nis S =\nR action\n\u221a\nSHE + Sm + SLV .

(12)\n\nNotice that the energy conservation (11) is fulfilled for \u03c1\nand p given by (9) and (10).\nIn the conventional General Relativity, the pressure\np and density \u03c1 are related, during the radiation era,\nby the relation p = \u03c1/3 (w = 1/3). From the Einstein\nfield equations it follows that the scale factor depends\non cosmic time as a(t) \u223c t1/2 , the matter density as\n3\n\u03c1R (t) = 32\u03c0G\nt\u22122 \u223c a\u22124 , and finally the temperature as\nq\n5\n3\n\u22121\n\u223c a\u22122 . In the case of SME with\nTR2 (t) = 4\u03c0\nGg\u2217 \u03c0 t\n\ngravity, the constant w = 1/3 is corrected by coefficients\nbreaking the Lorentz symmetry, and therefore may vary\nwith the time t.\nAs discussed by Colladay and McDonald [24], the formalism of statistical mechanics (as well as the laws of\nthermodynamics) in presence of Lorentz breakdown is\nthe same as for conventional statistical mechanics. We\ntherefore use the standard definition for the density \u03c1 and\n\n\f3\nthe pressure p. The general expressions for them are\nZ\nd3 P u\u03bc u\u03bd P \u03bc P \u03bd\n\u03c1=g\nf,\n(13)\n(2\u03c0)3\nP0\ng\np=\n3\n\nZ\n\nd3 P (u\u03bc u\u03bd \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd )P \u03bc P \u03bd\nf,\n(2\u03c0)3\nP0\n\n(14)\n\nwith u\u03bc = (1, 0, 0, 0) the four-velocity of the fluid,\nf = (eE/T \u00b1 1) is the Fermi-Dirac/Bose-Einstein distribution.

In the radiation era, the Universe\nwas filled by photons and ultra-relativistic fermion particles (baryons, electrons, neutrinos). According to SME\n[1], let us assume the photon sector as conventional, so\nthat coefficients for the Lorentz violation enter in the dispersion relations of ultra-relativistic particles. Without\nloss of generality, let us consider Lorentz violating correc(b)\ntions only for the baryon sector, i.e. c00 6= 0 (otherwise,\nP\n(a)\n(b)\nc\u03bc\u03bd is replaced by a qa c\u03bc\u03bd , where a = e, \u03bd, b, . . ., and\nqa are constants which accounts for the statistics of particles). Requiring the FRW symmetry, the non vanishing\n(traceless) coefficients c\u03bc\u03bd (\u226a 1) for the Lorentz violation\nare the diagonal components, with cij = c00 \u03b4 ij /3 (see\n[25]). As a consequence, one gets c\u03bc\u03bd P \u03bc P \u03bc \u2243 4c00 E 2 /3,\nE \u2243 (1 \u2212 4c00 /3)P , and the massive term turns out to\nbe modified as m2 (1 + c00 ). The latter may be neglected\nfor ultra-relativistic particles (P 2 \u226b m2 ). Eq.

In computing nB /s (Eq.\n(2)), \u03b4T may be neglected since gives rise to corrections\nof the second order.

This choice is particular interesting because implies that tensor mode fluctuations\nshould be observed in the next generation of experiments.\nSince the constraint of the observed baryon asymmetry\nis nB /s . 9 10\u221211 , one gets\n\u03a0 . 5.8 10\u221224.5 GeV \u22123/2 \u223c 3.1 10\u221260.5 sec3/2 ,\nAn upper bound for s00 is therefore\n\u00133/2\n\u0012\ntP l\nf or t & 10\u221238 sec .\ns00 . 7.6 104\nt\n\n(22)\n\n(23)\n\nwhere tP l \u223c 5.4 10\u221244 sec is the Planck time.

Of course such results refer to radiation dominated era. Different epochs, such as, for example, matter\ndominated era, lead to different field equations, hence\nto a different time-dependence of the Lorentz and CPT\nviolating coefficients, with potentially interesting consequences on cosmological scenarios offered by the SME\nwith gravity.\nIn conclusion, a cosmological consequence of the gravitational sector in the SME has been investigated in this\n\n\f4\npaper. Such a study is related to the (CPT violating)\ninteraction between the Ricci scalar curvature and the\nbaryon current (Eq. (1)). During the phase of the expanding Universe dominated by radiation, SME with the\ninclusion of gravity provides a framework in which the\nbaryon asymmetry may be gravitationally induced. The\ncurrent estimations on the observed baryon asymmetry\nyield an order of magnitude of coefficients breaking the\nLorentz and CPT symmetry.\nIt is a pleasure to thank V.
