We study the limits of inductive sequences (Ai , \u03c6i ) where each Ai\nis a direct sum of full matrix algebras over compact metric spaces and each\npartial map of \u03c6i is diagonal. We give a new characterisation of simplicity for\nsuch algebras, and apply it to prove that the said algebras have stable rank one\nwhenever they are simple and unital.

A \u2217-homomorphism\n\u03c6 : Mm (C(X)) \u2192 Mnm (C(Y ))\nis called diagonal if there are n continuous maps \u03bbi : Y \u2192 X such that\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nf \u25e6 \u03bb1\n0\n...\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n0\nf \u25e6 \u03bb2 . . .\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u03c6(f ) = \uf8ec\n\uf8f7.\n..\n..\n.\n.\n..\n..\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n.\n.\n0\n0\n. . . f \u25e6 \u03bbn\n\nThe \u03bbi are called the eigenvalue maps or simply eigenvalues of \u03c6. The multiset\n{\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , . . . , \u03bbn }is called the eigenvalue pattern of \u03c6 and is denoted by ep(\u03c6). This\ndefinition can be extended to \u2217-homomorphisms\nm\nn\nM\nM\nMmj (C(Yj ))\nMni (C(Xi )) \u2192\n\u03c6:\nj=1\n\ni=1\n\nby requiring, roughly, that each partial map\n\u03c6ij : Mni (C(Xi )) \u2192 Mmj (C(Yj ))\ninduced by \u03c6 be diagonal. (A precise definition can be found in Section 2.)\nC\u2217 -algebras obtained as limits of inductive systems (Ai , \u03c6i ) where\nAi =\n\nni\nM\n\nMni,j (C(Xi,j ))\n\nj=1\n\nand each \u03c6i is diagonal form a rich class. They include AF algebras, simple unital\nAT algebras (and hence the irrational rotation algebras) ([6]), Goodearl algebras\n([10]), and some interesting examples of Villadsen and the third named author\nconnected to Elliott's program to classify amenable C*-algebras via K-theory ([17],\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

TOMS\n\n[15]). The structure of these algebras is only well understood when they satisfy some\nadditional conditions such as (very) slow dimension growth or the combination\nof real rank zero, stable rank one, and weak unperforation of the K0 -group -\nsituations in which the strong form of Elliott's classification conjecture can be\nverified ([3], [5], [7], [8], [9]).\nIn this paper we give a new characterisation of simplicity for AH algebras with\ndiagonal connecting maps. As a consequence we are able to prove that such algebras\nhave stable rank one whenever they are unital and simple. The significance of our\nresult derives from the fact that we make no assumptions on the dimension growth\nof the algebras; we obtain a general theorem on the structure of algebras heretofore\nconsidered \"wild\". As suggested by M. R\u00f8rdam in his recent ICM address, it is high\ntime we became friends with such algebras, as opposed to treating them simply as\na source of pathological examples.\nAcknowledgement.

We use Mn to denote the set of n \u00d7 n complex matrices.\nGiven a closed subset E of a compact metric space (X, d) and \u03b4 > 0 we set\nB\u03b4 (E) = {x \u2208 X | d(E, x) < \u03b4},\nand make the convention that B\u03b4 (\u2205) = \u2205.\n2.2. AH systems with diagonal maps.\nDefinition 2.1. We will say that a unital \u2217-homomorphsim\nn\nM\nMni (C(Xi )) \u2192 Mk (C(Y )) \u223c\n\u03c6:\n= Mk \u2297 C(Y )\ni=1\n\nis diagonal if there exist natural numbers k1 , . . . , kn such that\nan embedding\nn\nM\nMki \u0592\u2192 Mk ,\n\u03b9:\n\nP\n\ni\n\nki = k and ni |ki ,\n\ni=1\n\nand diagonal maps\n\u03c6i : Mni (C(Xi )) \u2192 Mki \u2297 C(Y )\nsuch that\n\u03c6=\n\nn\nM\n\n\u03c6i .\n\ni=1\n\n(Notice that ki = 0 is allowed.)

If each \u03c6i is unital and diagonal, then we\nrefer to (Ai , \u03c6i ) as an AH system with diagonal maps. The limit algebra A will be\ncalled a diagonal AH algebra, and we will refer to (Ai , \u03c6i ) as a decomposition of A.\nAssume that A as above is diagonal. We will view \u03c6t,l\ni,j as a diagonal map from\nMni,t (C(Xi,t )) into the cut-down of Mnj,l (C(Xj,l )) by \u03c6t,l\ni,j (1). For fixed i and j,\nwe will denote by epij the multiset which is the union, counting multiplicity, of the\neigenvalue patterns of each \u03c6t,l\ni,j ; epij is the eigenvalue pattern of \u03c6i,j ; an element of\nepij is an eigenvalue map of \u03c6i,j . For fixed i, j, and l, we will denote by eplij the\nmultiset which is the union of the eigenvalue patters of each \u03c6t,l\ni,j .\nLet us now show that the bonding maps \u03c6i may be assumed to be injective. Let\n(Ai , \u03c6i ) be a decomposition for a diagonal AH algebra A as above. Fix i \u2208 N and\nj,l\n1 \u2264 t \u2264 ki . For each j > i and 1 \u2264 l \u2264 kj , Let Xi,t\ndenote the closed subset of Xi,t\nj\nj,l\nwhich is the union of the images of the eigenvalue maps of \u03c6t,l\ni,j . Put Xi,t = \u222al Xi,t ,\nj\nj\nj+1\nand X\u0303i,t = \u2229j Xi,t\n. Since Xi,t\n\u2287 Xi,t\n, we have that X\u0303i,t is closed subset of Xi,t .\nDefine\n\u00c3i,t = Mni,t (C(X\u0303i,t ))\nand\nki\nM\n\u00c3i,t .\n\u00c3i =\nt=1\n\nDefine diagonal maps \u03c6\u0303t,l\ni,i+1 : \u00c3i,t \u2192 \u00c3i+1,l by replacing the eigenvalue maps of\nt,l\n\u03c6i,i+1 with their restrictions to X\u0303i+1,l . Define \u03c6\u0303i : \u00c3i \u2192 \u00c3i+1 in a manner analogous\nto the definition of \u03c6i . It follows that (\u00c3i , \u03c6\u0303i ) is a diagonal AH system with limit\nA, and \u03c6\u0303i is injective by construction. We assume from here on that all bonding\nmaps in diagonal AH systems are injective.\nOne way to construct a simple diagonal AH algebra is to ensure that for each\ni \u2208 N and x in a specified dense subset of Xi there is some j \u2265 i such that for each\nl \u2208 {1, . . . , kj } the diagonal map \u03c6t,l\ni,j contains the eigenvalue map evx : Xj,l \u2192 Xi,t\ngiven by evx (y) = x. The next definition gives and approximate version of this\nsituation.\n\n\f4\n\nGEORGE A. ELLIOTT, TOAN M. HO, AND ANDREW S. TOMS\n\nDefinition 2.2. Say that a diagonal AH algebra A with decomposition (Ai , \u03c6i )\nhas the property P if for any i \u2208 N, element f in Ai , \u01eb > 0, and x \u2208 Xi there exist\nj \u2265 i and unitaries ul \u2208 Aj,l , l \u2208 {1, . . . , kj } such that\n\u0013\n\u0012\nf (x) 0\n\u2217\n<\u01eb\nul \u03c6t,l\n(f\n)u\n\u2212\nl\ni,j\n0\nbl\nfor some appropriately sized bl . (Note that diag(f (x0 ), bl ) \u2208 Aj,l .)\nWe will prove in the sequel that A as in Definition 2.2 is simple if and only if it has\nproperty P.\n2.3. A characterisation of simplicity. Proposition 2.1 of [4] gives some necessary and sufficent conditions for the simplicity of an AH algebra. We will have\noccasion to apply these in the proof of our main result, and so restate the said\nproposition in the particular case of an AH system with diagonal injective maps.\nProposition 2.3. Let (Ai , \u03c6i ) be an AH system with diagonal injective maps, and\nset A = limi\u2192\u221e (Ai , \u03c6i ). The following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) A is simple;\n(ii) For any positive integer i and any non-empty open subset U of Xi , there is\na j0 \u2265 i such that for every j \u2265 j0 and l \u2208 {1, . . . , kj } we have\n(eplij )\u22121 (U ) = Xj,l ,\nwhere (eplij )\u22121 (U ) denotes the union of the sets \u03bb\u22121 (U ), \u03bb \u2208 eplij ;\n(iii) For any non-zero element a in Ai , there is a j0 \u2265 i such that for every\nj \u2265 j0 , \u03c6ij (a)(x) is not zero, for every x in Xj .\n2.4. Paths between permutation matrices. Given any permutation \u03c0 \u2208 Sn ,\nlet U [\u03c0] denote the permutation matrix in Mn corresponding to \u03c0, that is, U [\u03c0]\nth\nis obtained from the identity of Mn by moving the ith row to the \u03c0(i) row, for\ni \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n}. Any two permutation matrices are homotopic inside the unitary\ngroup U(Mn ) of Mn , but we want to define some particular homotopies for use in\nthe sequel. Let \u03c0 and \u03c3 be elements of Sn , viewed as permutations of the canonical\nbasis vectors e1 , . . . , en of Cn . Let R = {eW,1 , . . . , eW,dim(W ) } be the set of basis\nvectors upon which \u03c0 and \u03c3 agree, and choose \u03b3 \u2208 Sn be such that\n\u03b3\u03c3(v) = \u03b3\u03c0(v) = v, \u2200v \u2208 R.\nThen U [\u03b3]U [\u03c3] and U [\u03b3]U [\u03c0] fix e1 , . . . , e|R| . Put W = span{e1 , . . . , e|R| }, and let\nV be the orthogonal complement of W .

Let us first consider the case that \u03c3 is a k-cycle. The hypotheses of the\nlemma guarantee that the desired conclusion holds already for t \u2208 {0, 1}. Choose\nthe homotopy u(t) as in Subsection 2.4 by using our given value of \u03c3 and setting\n\u03c0 equal to the identity element of Sn . The hypothesis \u03bbi = \u03bb\u03c3(i) , i \u2208 {1, . . . , n},\nimplies that there is a \u03bb \u2208 C such that for each i \u2208 {1, . . . , n} which is not fixed by\n\u03c3 we have \u03bbi = \u03bb. In other words, if one decomposes diag(\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn ) into a direct\nsum of two diagonal matrices using the decomposition Cn = W \u2295 V - V and W\nas in Subsection 2.4 - then the direct summand corresponding to V is scalar k \u00d7 k\nmatrix. By construction, u(t) = v(t) \u2295 1n\u2212k , with v(t) \u2208 U(Mk ). It follows that\nu(t) commutes with diag(\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn ) for each t \u2208 (0, 1).\nNow suppose now that \u03c3 is any permutation on n letters, and write \u03c3 as a\nproduct of disjoint cycles: \u03c3 = \u03c31 \u03c32 . . . \u03c3l . For each j \u2208 {1, . . . , l}, let ui (j) denote\nthe unitary path between U [id] and U [\u03c3j ], constructed as in Subsection 2.4. Now\nu(t) := u1 (t)u2 (t) * * * ul (t)\nis a path of unitaries with u(0) = U [id] and u(1) = U [\u03c3], and u(t) commutes with\ndiag(\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn ) since each uj (t) does.\n\u0003\nLemma 2.5. Let \u03c3 be any permutation in Sn , and A, B disjoint nonempty closed\nsubsets of a metric space X. Let \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn : X \u2192 C be continuous. Then, there\nexists a unitary v \u2208 Mn (C(X)) such that\n(i) v(x) = 1n , \u2200x \u2208 A,\n(ii) v(x) = U [\u03c3], \u2200x \u2208 B, and\n(iii) v(x) commutes with diag(\u03bb1 (x), . . . , \u03bbn (x)) whenever \u03bbi (x) = \u03bb\u03c3(i) (x) for\neach i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}.\nProof. Find a unitary path u(t) connecting U [id] to U [\u03c3] using Lemma 2.4, so that\nu(t) commutes with diag(\u03bb1 (x), . . . , \u03bbn (x)) for each t \u2208 (0, 1) and each x \u2208 X for\nwhich \u03bbi (x) = \u03bb\u03c3(i) (x), i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}. By Urysohn's Lemma, there is a continuous\nmap f : X \u2192 [0, 1] which is equal to zero on A and equal to one on B. It\nis straightforward to check that v(x) := u(f (x)) satisfies the conclusion of the\nlemma.\n\u0003\nLemma 2.6. Let Y be a closed subset of a normal space X, and let f : Y \u2192 Sn\nbe continuous.

The Main Theorem\nLet A be a diagonal AH algebra with decomposition (Ai , \u03c6i ), and assume that\nthe \u03c6i are injective. In this section we will prove that if A is simple then it has the\nproperty P (cf. Section 2). (The converse also holds, but is easier by far.) Let us\nbegin with an outline of our strategy, before plunging headlong into the proof.\nAssume first that A is simple and Ai = Mni (C(Xi )), so that there are no partial\nmaps to contend with. Let there be given a natural number i, an element f of Ai ,\na point x0 \u2208 Xi , and some \u01eb > 0. Put U = B\u01eb (x0 ).

Let U be the open ball centered at x0 \u2208 X with radius \u03b7,\nand suppose that\n\u22121\n\u22121\nY = \u03bb\u22121\n1 (U ) \u222a \u03bb2 (U ) \u222a . . . \u222a \u03bbn (U ).\nThen there is a unitary u in Mnm (C(Y )) and element b \u2208 Mnm\u2212m (C(Y )) such that\n\u0012\n\u0013\nf (x0 ) 0\nu\u03c6(f )u\u2217 \u2212\n< \u01eb.\n0\nb\nProof. By Proposition 3.2, we can assume that m = 1. SLet Fi be the closure of\nn\n\u03bb\u22121\ni (U ) for each i. Now, apply Theorem 3.1. Since Y =\ni=1 Fi , we are done. \u0003\nNow, we are ready to prove the main theorem of this section.\n\nTheorem 3.4. Let A = lim\n\u2212\u2192(Ai , \u03c6i ) be a unital diagonal AH algebra. Then, A is\nsimple if and only if A has the property P of Definition 2.2.\nProof. Suppose that A has property P. Let f \u2208 Ai be nonzero, so that there is a\npoint x0 in Xi such that f (x0 ) 6= 0. By the definition of property P, there are an\ninteger j > i and unitaries ul \u2208 Aj,l , l \u2208 {1, . . . , kj } such that\n\u0013\n\u0012\nf (x0 ) 0\nt,l\n\u2217\nul \u03c6i,j (f )ul \u2212\n<\u01eb\n0\nbl\nfor some appropriately sized bl . We may assume that \u01eb < ||f (x0 )||, so that \u03c6ij (f ) is\nnowhere zero. This implies that the ideal of Aj generated by \u03c6ij (f ) is all of Aj , and\nthat the ideal of A generated by the image of f is all of A. Since f was arbitrary,\nA is simple.\nNow assume that A is simple, and let f \u2208 Ai,t be nonzero. Recall that the \u03c6i\nmay be taken to be injective. By Proposition 2.3 there exists, for each x0 \u2208 Xi,t\nand \u01eb > 0, a j0 > i with the following property: for every j \u2265 j0 and every\nl \u2208 {1, . . . , kj } we have\nep\u22121 (\u03c6t,l\ni,j )(B\u03b4 (x0 )) = Xj,l ,\nwhere \u03b4 is some positive number such that\nd(f (x), f (y)) < \u01eb whenever d(x, y) < 2\u03b4.\nAs pointed out in Section 2, the map \u03c6t,l\ni,j may be viewed as a diagonal map from\nAi,t into the cut-down of Aj,l by the projection \u03c6t,l\ni,j (1); any unitary u in this corner\nof Aj,l gives rise to a unitary \u0169 in Aj,l by setting \u0169 = u \u2295 (1Aj,l \u2212 \u03c6t,l\ni,j (1). Combining\nthis observation with Corollary 3.3 we see that there exists, for each l \u2208 {1, . . . , kj },\na unitary ul \u2208 Aj,l such that\n\u0013\n\u0012\nf (x0 ) 0\n\u2217\n< \u01eb.\nul \u03c6t,l\n(f\n)u\n\u2212\nl\ni,j\n0\nbl\nThus, A has property P, as desired.\n\n\u0003\n\n\fC\u2217 -ALGEBRAS WITH STABLE RANK ONE\n\n11\n\n4. Stable Rank\nTheorem 4.1. Let A = \u2212\nlim\n\u2192(Ai , \u03c6i ) be a simple unital diagonal AH algebra. Then,\nA has stable rank one.\nBefore proving Theorem 4.1, we situate it relative to other results on the stable\nrank of general approximately homogeneous (AH) algebras. Recall that an AH\nalgebra is an inductive limit C \u2217 -algebra A = limi\u2192\u221e (Ai , \u03c6i ), where\n(6)\n\nAi =\n\nni\nM\n\npi,l (C(Xi,l ) \u2297 K)pi,l\n\nl=1\n\nfor compact connected Hausdorff spaces Xi,l , projections pi,l \u2208 C(Xi,l ) \u2297 K, and\nnatural numbers ni . If A is separable, then one may assume that the Xi,l are\nfinite CW-complexes ([1], [11]). The inductive system (Ai , \u03c6i ) is referred to as a\ndecomposition for A. All AH algebras in this paper are assumed to be separable.\nIf an AH algebra A admits a decompostion as in (6) for which\n\u001b\n\u001a\ndim(Xi,ni ) i\u2192\u221e\ndim(Xi,1 )\n\u2212\u2192 0,\n,...,\nmax1\u2264l\u2264ni\nrank(pi,1 )\nrank(pi,ni )\nthen we say that A has slow dimension growth. Theorem 1 of [2] states that every\nsimple unital AH algebra with slow dimension growth has stable rank one. Villadsen\nin [17] constructed simple diagonal AH algebras which do not have slow dimension\ngrowth, but which do have stable rank one; the converse of [2, Theorem 1] does\nnot hold. There are in fact a wealth of simple diagonal AH algebras without slow\ndimension growth which exhibit all sorts of interesting behaviour (cf. [14], [15],\n[16]), whence Theorem 4.1 is widely applicable.\nSimple AH algebras may have stable rank strictly greater than one, and there\nis reason to believe that Theorem 4.1 is quite close to being best possible. One\nmight be able to generalise our result to the setting of AH algebras where the\nprojections \u03c6i,j (pi,l ) appearing in (6) can be decomposed into a direct sum of a\ntrivial projection \u03b8j and a second projection qj such that \u03c4 (qj ) \u2192 0 as j \u2192 \u221e\nfor any trace \u03c4 . Otherwise, one finds oneself in a situation very similar to the\nconstruction of [18], where the stable rank is always strictly greater than one.\nLet us now prepare for the proof of Therem 4.1.\nLemma 4.2. Let a \u2208 Mm (C(X)) be block diagonal, i.e.,\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 0 ... 0\n\uf8ec 0 a1 . . . 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\na=\uf8ec . .\n\uf8f7,\n. . ...\n\uf8ed ..\n\uf8f8\n0 0 . . . an\nwhere ai \u2208 Mki (C(X)) for natural numbers k1 , . . . , kn . If the size of the matrix 0\nin the upper left-hand corner of a is strictly greater than max1\u2264i\u2264n ki , then a can\nbe approximated arbitrarily closely by invertible elements in Mm (C(X)).\nProof. Let \u01eb > 0 be given, and let k denote the size of the matrix 0 in the upper\nleft-hand corner of a. Since k > ki , i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}, there is a permutation matrix\n\n\f12\n\nGEORGE A.

As was proved in [13], every nilpotent element in a unital C\u2217 -algebra\ncan be approximated arbitrarily closely by invertible elements. We may thus find\nan invertible element b \u2208 Mm (C(X)) such that ||U a \u2212 b|| < \u01eb, and\n||a \u2212 U \u22121 b|| = ||U \u22121 U a \u2212 U \u22121 b|| \u2264 ||U \u22121 || * ||U a \u2212 b|| < \u01eb.\nThe lemma now follows from the fact that U \u22121 b is invertible.\n\n\u0003\n\nIt easy to prove that a \u2208 Mn (C(X)) is invertible if and only if a(x) is invertible\nfor each x \u2208 X. The proof of the next lemma is also straightforward.\nLemma 4.3. Let p, q be orthogonal projections in a C\u2217 -algebra A, and let \u01eb > 0\nbe given. If elements a and b in A can be approximated to within \u01eb by invertible\nelements in pAp and qAq, respectively, then a + b can be approximated to within \u01eb\nby an invertible element in (p + q)A(p + q).\nNow, we are ready to prove Theorem 4.1.\nProof of Theorem 4.1. SSince every element in A can be approximated arbitrarily\n\u221e\nclosely by elements in i=1 Ai , it will suffice to prove for any \u01eb > 0 and any a \u2208 Ai ,\nthere is an invertible element in A whose distance to a is less than \u01eb. (Note that\nwe are using the injectivity of the \u03c6i to identify Ai with its image in A.)\nBy Lemma 4.3, we may assume that Ai = Mni (C(Xi )). We also assume that a\nis not invertible. By the comment preceding Lemma 4.3, there is a point x0 \u2208 Xi\nsuch that det(a(x0 ))= 0. There are permutation matrices u, v \u2208 Mni and a matrix\nc \u2208 Mni \u22121 such that\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 0\nua(x0 )v =\n,\n0 c\nLet b denote the element uav. Following the lines of the proof of Lemma 4.2, it will\nsuffice to prove that b can be approximated to within \u01eb by an invertible element of\nA.\nFor each j > i, \u03c6i,j (b) is a tuple of kj elements. If each coordinate of \u03c6i,j (b) can\nbe approximated to within \u01eb by an invertible element in the corner of A generated\nby the unit of Aj,l , then \u03c6i,j (b) can be approximated to within \u01eb by an invertible\nelement of A. We may therefore assume that Aj = Mnj (C(Yj ), and concern ourselves with proving that \u03c6i,j (b) is approximated to within \u01eb by an invertible element\nin A.\nBy Theorem 3.4, there exist an integer j > i, a unitary w \u2208 Aj and an element\nb\u2032 such that\n\u0012\n\u0013\nb(x0 ) 0\n\u2217\nw\u03c6ij (b)w \u2212\n< \u01eb/2.\n0\nb\u2032\nWe have\n\u0012\n\nb(x0 )\n0\n\n0\nb\u2032\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n0 0\n0 b\u2032\u2032\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n\fC\u2217 -ALGEBRAS WITH STABLE RANK ONE\n\n13\n\nwhere b\u2032\u2032 = diag(c, b\u2032 ). Put d = w\u03c6i,j (b)w\u2217 , and note that it will suffice to prove\nthat \u03c6j,m (d) is approximated to within \u01eb/2 by an invertible element in Am for some\nm > j.\nSince A is simple, there is an integer m > j large enough so that, for each\nt \u2208 {1, . . . , km }, either the number of the eigenvalue maps of \u03c61,t\nj,m counted with\n\u2032\u2032\nmultiplicity is strictly larger than the size of the matrix b , or the image of \u03c61,t\nj,m\nis finite-dimensional. In the latter case, \u03c61,t\n(d)\nis\napproximated\nto\nwithin\n\u01eb\nby\nan\nj,m\n1,t\n\u2217\ninvertible element in the image of \u03c6j,m since finite-dimensional C -algebras have\nstable rank one, so we may assume that the number of eigenvalue maps of \u03c61,t\nj,m ,\n\u2032\u2032\ncounted with multiplicity, is strictly larger than the size of the matrix b . Then,\n\u03c61,t\nj,m (d) is unitarily equivalent to\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 0 ... 0\n\uf8ec 0 b1 . . . 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec .. .. . .\n.. \uf8f7\n\uf8ed . .\n. . \uf8f8\n0 0 . . . bl\ninside Am,t , where bk is the composition of b\u2032\u2032 and the k th eigenvalue map of \u03c61,t\nj,m ,\nand the size of the matrix 0 at the upper left-hand corner of the above matrix is\nstrictly bigger than the size of the matrix bk for every k. By Lemma 4.2, the matrix\nabove can be approximated to within \u01eb/2 by an invertible in Am,t , as required. \u0003\nCorollary 4.4. Let A be a simple unital diagonal AH algebra. If A has real rank\nzero and weakly unperforated K0 -group, then A is tracially AF.\nProof. By Theorem 4.1, A has stable rank one. The corollary then follows from a\nresult of Lin ([12, Theorem 2.1]).\n\u0003\nCorollary 4.4 applies, for instance, to simple unital diagonal AH algebras for\nwhich the spaces Xi in some diagonal decomposition for A are all contractible. This\ncontractibility hypothesis may seem strong, but it does not substantially restrict\nthe complexity of A; if one wants to classify all such A via K-theory and traces,\nthen the additional assumption of very slow dimension growth and the full force\nof [8] and [9] are required; the collection of all such cannot cannot be classified by\ntopological K-theory and traces alone ([15]).\nReferences\n[1] Blackadar, B.: Matricial and ultramatricial topology, Operator algebras, mathematical\nphysics, and low-dimensional topology (Istanbul, 1991), Res.
