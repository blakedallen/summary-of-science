Introduction\nALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) [1] is the experiment dedicated to study the properties of strongly interacting matter at extreme energy densities (> 10 GeV/fm3 ), as those which are expected to be reached\nin Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC. Lattice QCD calculations predict that under this condition a deconfined Quark Gluon Plasma could be formed. In\nthe new energy domain reached by the LHC, heavy quarks are abundantly\nproduced. The study of their production, propagation and hadronization\nin the hot and dense nuclear matter created in heavy ion collisions can provide valuable information about the properties of the system. In fact, heavy\nquarks are produced in the first stage of the collisions and then they coexist\nwith the surrounding medium due to their long lifetime. For example, the\n\u2217\n\nPresented at Epiphany 2011\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\n\nTieulent \u0307EPIPHANY2011 \u0307v3\n\nprinted on November 6, 2018\n\nenergy density of the created medium can be inferred by an energy loss measurement of heavy quark. The study of the production of heavy quarkonia,\nJ/\u03c8, \u03c8 \u2032 (cc\u0304 states), \u03a5, \u03a5\u2032 and \u03a5\u2032\u2032 , (bb\u0304 states) is particularly interesting,\nbecause it can lead to a measurement of the temperature of the system.\nIt was originally proposed that quarkonium resonances will dissociate by\ncolor screening in the QGP [2], thus a suppression of quarkonium production in nucleus-nucleus collisions compared to proton-proton collisions was\npredicted as a signature of the QGP formation. However, it is now recognized that in order to interpret J/\u03c8 production as a QGP probe one has\nto consider cold nuclear matter effects such as initial state energy loss and\nshadowing, as well as charm quark energy loss, co-mover interactions, corrections for feed-down from higher mass charmonium states, and secondary\nproduction mechanisms, such as recombination of initially uncorrelated cc\u0304\npairs [3]. In this contribution we present results based on \u221a\nthe data collected\nby the ALICE experiment in proton-proton collisions at s=7 TeV.\n2. Heavy flavour detection by the ALICE experiment\nThe detailed description of the ALICE experimental setup, which was\ndesigned to deal with charged particle multiplicity of few thousand particles\nper unit of rapidity, can be found in reference [1].\nIn the central region (|\u03b7| <0.9), the heavy flavour capability of ALICE relies in a high granularity tracking system made of the Inner Tracking\nSystem (ITS), the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and the Transition Radiation Detector (TRD). The particle identification is performed via dE/dx\nmeasurement in the TPC, via time of flight measurement in the Time Of\nFlight detector (TOF), and via electron/pion discrimination operated by\nthe TRD1 . These central detectors are embedded in a solenoidal magnetic\nfield of 0.5 T. Open charm is studied via the reconstruction of hadronic\ndecays. In the following we will present the results concerning the channels\nD0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + and D+ \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + . The open charm and open beauty are\nalso studied via their inclusive semi-electronic decay channels D,B\u2192 e + X.\nFinally, the quarkonia can be detected via their di-electronic decay channel.\nIn this report we present the inclusive J/\u03c8 cross section.\nIn the forward region, the ALICE muon spectrometer covers the rapidity range -4.0< \u03b7 <-2.5. The muon spectrometer consists of an absorber\nto filter the hadronic background, a tracking system made of ten cathode\npad chambers, and four planes of trigger chambers made of Resistive Plate\nChambers (RPC) placed downstream of an iron wall of 1.2 m, which acts as\na muon filter. The spectrometer makes possible the study of the open charm\nand beauty in the inclusive semi-muonic decay channel (D, B\u2192 \u03bc + X). In\n1\n\nIn the presented analyses the TRD is not used in the PID.\n\n\fTieulent \u0307EPIPHANY2011 \u0307v3\n\nprinted on November 6, 2018\n\n3\n\nthis report we present the pt -differential cross section of inclusive muons\nfrom heavy flavour decays in 2< pT <6.5 GeV/c. Quarkonia states are\nmeasured via their di-muonic decay channel. In the following we present\nthe pt -differential cross section of inclusive J/\u03c8.\n3. Data sample\n\u221a\nAt central rapidity, the p-p data at s=7 TeV were collected with a\nminimum bias (MB) trigger requiring at least one hit in the SPD (Silicon\nPixel Detector, forming the two innermost layers of the ITS) or a signal in\nat least one of the two VZERO detectors (two scintillator hodoscopes placed\non either side of the interaction region at z=3.3 m and z=-0.9 m, covering\nthe pseudorapidity regions 2.8 < \u03b7 <5.1 and -3.7< \u03b7 <-1.7). This trigger\ncorresponds approximately to at least one charged particle over 8 units\nof pseudorapidity. The events were in coincidence with signals from two\nbeam pick-up counters, one on each side of the interaction region, signing\nthe passage of proton bunches. The absolute normalization has been done\nusing minimum-bias cross section extracted from the so called \"van der\nMeer\" scan (\u03c3M B = 71.4 \u00b1 7.1 (syst.) mb).\nIn the forward region, in addition to the previous minimum-bias trigger\nconditions, the detection of at least one muon in the muon spectrometer is\nrequired. The muon trigger allows the selection of events where at least one\nparticle, having pT larger than the trigger threshold (0.5 GeV/c), has been\ndetected in the muon trigger chambers [1].\nThe results presented in this report correspond to about 108 MB triggers\n(integrated luminosity of 1.5 nb\u22121 ) and 107 muon triggers (11.6 nb\u22121 ).\n4. Open charm measurement in hadronic channels\nThe hadronic open charm decay signal extraction is based on a invariant mass analysis of the fully reconstructed decay products. Among the\nmost promising channels for open charm detection are the D0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 +\nand D+ \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + decays. In order to reduce the large combinatorial\nbackground, topological selections are applied. The selection of the events\nrequires a displaced-vertex topology with a good alignment between the\nreconstructed D meson momentum and the flight path defined as the line\nbetween the primary and the secondary vertices. This selection is made\npossible thanks to the excellent tracking precision provided by the Inner\nTracking System. A more detailed description of the analysis procedure can\nbe found in reference [4].\nUsing about 108 minimum-bias events, the pT -differential cross sections\nfor D0 and D+ have been extracted with 6 pT bins from 2 to 12 GeV/c.\n\n\f-\n\nD0 \u2192 K \u03c0+\npp, s = 7 TeV, 1.4 nb-1\n\n102\n\nd\u03c3 / dpt |\n\nd\u03c3 / dpt |\n\n103\n-\n\nD+ \u2192 K \u03c0 + \u03c0+\npp, s = 7 TeV, 1.4 nb-1\n\n102\nALICE Preliminary\n\n|y|<0.5\n\nALICE Preliminary\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\nPWG3-Preliminary-024\n\n1\nstat. unc.\nsyst. unc.\nFONLL\n\n10-1\n0\n\nprinted on November 6, 2018\n\n\u03bcb/GeV/c\n\n103\n\n|y|<0.5\n\n\u03bcb/GeV/c\n\nTieulent \u0307EPIPHANY2011 \u0307v3\n\nGM-VFNS\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\u00b1 10% global norm. unc.

The correction for D mesons coming from B mesons\nfeed-down has been computed using beauty over charm ratio given by the\nFixed Order Next-to-Leading Log (FONLL) calculations [5].\nThe correction for the beauty feed-down using the measured displacement of the D mesons from beauty from the primary vertex is currently\nunder way. The analysis is on going to exploit the entire 2010 data sample in order to extend the pT coverage towards both larger and smaller pT\nvalues.\n\n5. Electrons from heavy flavour decays\nHeavy flavour production at central rapidity can be studied using the\nsingle-electron pT distribution [7]. The ALICE central detectors offer a very\ngood particle identification capability. A clean electron sample is obtained\napplying the PID information given from TOF and TPC up to a momentum\nof 4 GeV/c. The remaining hadron contamination varies from the permille\nlevel at 0.5 GeV/c to about 15% at 4 GeV/c and is subtracted by a multiple\nGaussian fit performed in momentum slices of the TPC dE/dx distribution.\nThe signal extraction method consists in subtracting from the inclusive\nelectron spectrum a cocktail of the background electron sources, namely,\nelectrons from light hadron decays, photon conversions in the material of\nthe beam pipe and of the SPD. After the cocktail subtraction, the inclusive\ncross section of electrons from charm and beauty decays is obtained.\n\n\fTieulent \u0307EPIPHANY2011 \u0307v3\n\nprinted on November 6, 2018\n\n5\n\nFig. 2. Inclusive single electron yield as a function of pT compared with the electron\ncocktail describing the main background sources.\n\nFigure 2 shows the inclusive pT electron spectrum in the transverse\nmomentum range 0.4 < pT < 4 GeV/c, after acceptance, efficiency and\nBremsstrahlung effect corrections. Superimposed are the different cocktail\ncontributions to this pT distribution. The excess of electrons above the\ncocktail level can be attributed to the signal of electrons from heavy-flavour\ndecays (including J/\u03c8, not yet included in the cocktail). An excess is clearly\nseen, increasing as a function of pT , as expected. The further developments\nof this analysis will include the electron PID from TRD and EMCal (Electromagnetic Calorimeter) to extend the analysis to higher pT values.\n6. Forward single muons from heavy flavour decays\nHeavy-flavour production at forward rapidity can be studied using the\nsingle-muon pT distribution [8], measured in the muon spectrometer covering -4< \u03b7 <-2.5. Apart from the heavy flavour, three main background\nsources are contributing to the single-muon pT distribution. (i) Muons from\nthe decay-in-flight of light hadrons produced at the interaction point called\n\"decay muons\". (ii) Muons from the decay of hadrons produced in the\ninteraction with the front absorber, called \"secondary muons\". The last\n\n\f6\n\nTieulent \u0307EPIPHANY2011 \u0307v3\n\nprinted on November 6, 2018\n\nFig. 3. Single muon coming from heavy flavour\npQCD calculations.\n\nd\u03c3\ndpT\n\ncross section compared to\n\nsource of background are (iii) the punch-through hadrons. This last contribution can be rejected by requiring that the reconstructed track reaches the\ntrigger stations placed behind the iron wall, leaving hits in at least three\nchambers out of four. In the present analysis, muons are required to have\npT greater than 2 GeV/c thus removing most of the background which has\na softer pT distributions. With such a cut, the contribution from secondary\nmuons is reduced to about 3%. About 25% of the remaining background\noriginates from decaying muons and is subtracted by means of simulations.\nThe transverse momentum distribution of decay muons was generated with\nthe Perugia-0 tune of PYTHIA [9], and normalized in such a way that the\nresulting fraction of decay-muons in the pT range where this contribution\nis dominant (0.5< pT < 1 GeV/c) is the same as the one provided by the\nsimulation. After background subtraction, the muon pT spectrum is corrected for efficiency. The resulting differential cross section for charm and\nbeauty production in the single muon decay channel is shown in figure 3 for\nan integrated luminosity of 3.49 nb\u22121 . The comparison of a pQCD based\ntheoretical calculation, shown in the figure, shows a good agreement with\ndata within the errors.\n7. Inclusive J/\u03c8 production cross section\nInclusive J/\u03c8 cross section can be measured in ALICE both at central\nand forward rapidity. At central rapidity, the J/\u03c8 are detected via the e+ e\u2212\ndecay channel in the rapidity range |y| < 0.88. The particle identification is\ndone using the TPC dE/dx information.

The signal extraction\nis done subtracting the like sign distribution to the opposite sign invariant\nmass spectra. Preliminary results are based on an integrated luminosity\nof 1.5 nb\u22121 . The number of J/\u03c8 is extracted, with a bin counting technique, in the mass range 2.9-3.15 GeV/c2 and it amounts to 95 \u00b1 18(stat.).\nAfter correction for acceptance and efficiency and normalization using the\nminimum-bias cross section, the resulting inclusive J/\u03c8 production cross\nsection is: d\u03c3J/\u03c8 /dy(|y|<0.88) = 7.36 \u00b1 1.22(stat.) \u00b1 1.32(syst.)+0.88\n\u22121.84 (pol.) \u03bcb.\nAt forward rapidity (\u22124.0 < y < \u22122.5) the J/\u03c8 are measured via the\n\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 decay channel. The results presented in the following are based on an\nintegrated luminosity of 11.6 nb\u22121 . The J/\u03c8 signal is extracted by fitting\nthe invariant mass distribution with two Crystal Ball functions (for the J/\u03c8\nand the \u03c8') and two exponentials (below and above the J/\u03c8 mass). A more\ndetailed description of the analysis procedure can be found in reference [10].\nThe total number of J/\u03c8 is NJ/\u03c8 =1924 \u00b177(stat.). The resulting inclusive\nJ/\u03c8 production cross section is: d\u03c3J/\u03c8 /dy(\u22124<y|<\u22122.5) = 7.25 \u00b1 0.29(stat.) \u00b1\n0.98(syst.)+0.87\n\u22121.50 (pol.) \u03bcb, after acceptance and efficiency corrections.\nThe pT -differential cross section has been extracted using seven bins\nin pT in the range 0< pT <8 GeV/c. Figure 4-left shows the resulting\nd\u03c3J/\u03c8 /dpT in the rapidity range -4< y <-2.5. These results are compared\nwith the corresponding measurement done by the LHCb experiment [11].\nThe agreement with the preliminary results of the LHCb experiment, in the\nsame rapidity range, is clearly visible. A comparison with a Color Evaporation Model (CEM) calculation for prompt J/\u03c8 [12] is also shown. The\n\n\f8\n\nTieulent \u0307EPIPHANY2011 \u0307v3\n\nprinted on November 6, 2018\n\npredictions underestimate the experimental results but a more meaningful\ncomparison would require the subtraction of J/\u03c8 coming from beauty decay.\nThe rapidity-differential cross section has been extracted using five rapidity bins and combined with the measurement done at central rapidity.\nFigure 4-right shows the resulting d\u03c3J/\u03c8 /dy distribution. The values obtained in the forward region are also shown reflected with respect to y = 0.\nThe ALICE measurement is compared to result from CMS [13]. A comparison with the CEM calculation for prompt J/\u03c8 is shown as well as with a\nQCD-based Colour-Singlet Model [14].\n8. Conclusions\nWe have presented the first heavy-flavour production measurements\nper\u221a\nformed by the ALICE experiment in proton-proton collisions at s = 7 TeV\nat LHC. ALICE has good capability to measure heavy-flavour in various\ndecay channels at both central and forward rapidity down to zero pT . In\nparticular, we have shown the first results concerning open heavy-flavour\nmeasurements in single electron and single muon channels as a function of\npT . For both analysis, the next step will be to extend the pT range. First\ncomparison with pQCD calculations shows good agreement. We have measured charm production at central rapidity using fully-reconstructed decays\nof D mesons in hadronic final states. The D0 and D+ pT distributions have\nbeen extracted. Analysis for other decay channels are well advanced. We\nhave presented the first results on rapidity- and pT -differential cross sections of inclusive J/\u03c8 production at central and forward rapidity, using its\nleptonic decay channels.\nREFERENCES\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n\nThe ALICE Collaboration, JINST 3 (2008) S08002.\nT.
