Banerjee, Kranti Kumar and P. Chaddah.\nUGC-DAE Consortium for Scientific Research, University Campus, Khandwa Road,\nIndore-452017, INDIA.\n\nAbstract\nMagnetization measurements in La0.5Ca0.5MnO3 manganite show that the hightemperature long-range ferromagnetic-metallic phase transforms to antiferromagneticinsulating phase, although a fraction of ferromagnetic-metallic phase undergoes glasslike kinetic arrest and coexists at low temperature with the equilibrium\nantiferromagnetic-insulating phase. We show here through resistivity measurements that\nthe residual arrested ferromagnetic-metallic fraction can be converted to the equilibrium\nantiferromagnetic-insulating phase by successive annealing at higher temperatures,\npossibly through heterogeneous nucleation of equilibrium phase. Significantly, larger\nfractions of this glassy ferromagnetic-metallic phase can be obtained by cooling in\nhigher fields and larger conversion to equilibrium antiferromagnetic-insulating phase\nresults.\n\nGlasses form below a temperature where dynamics is arrested, preserving the hightemperature structure while avoiding the first-order liquid-solid transformation at the\nhigher temperature TC. Rapid cool-down is needed to arrest the transformation kinetics for\nmetallic alloys, while glass-formers like O-terphenyl vitrify easily because the kinetics is\narrested at a temperature TK that is closer to TC1-3. Arrest of kinetics can also inhibit a firstorder process where both the phases on either side of the transition have long-range\nstructural, including magnetic, order. It has been shown recently that glass-like arrest of\nkinetics intervenes in first-order magnetic transformations and results in coexisting phases\nwith competing magnetic orders4-8. In La0.5Ca0.5MnO3 manganite, the high-temperature\nlong-range ferromagnetic-metallic phase transforms to antiferromagnetic-insulating phase,\nalthough a fraction of ferromagnetic-metallic phase coexists at low temperature9.\nMagnetization measurements show that this ferromagnetic-metallic phase has undergone\nglass-like kinetic arrest and coexists at low temperature with the equilibrium\nantiferromagnetic-insulating phase, similar to other half-doped manganites8,10. We show\nhere through resistivity measurements that the residual arrested ferromagnetic-metallic\n\n\f2\n\nfraction can be converted to the equilibrium antiferromagnetic-insulating phase by\nsuccessive annealing at higher temperatures1. The restoration of kinetics in the arrested\nphase presumably results in heterogeneous nucleation of equilibrium phase. We obtained\nlarger fractions of this glassy ferromagnetic-metallic phase by cooling in higher fields and\nfound better conversion to equilibrium antiferromagnetic-insulating phase, reminiscent of\ndevitrification of structural glasses into crystallites. The TC can be varied over a wide range\nwith magnetic field and the difference between TK and TC can be tuned in the same sample.\nThis advantage may help shed light on the physics of structural glasses.\n\nAlthough glasses have been used for many centuries and variety of materials\nincluding monatomic metallic liquids are capable of glass formation11, a quantitative\nunderstanding of the glass transition remains a major scientific challenge. Glasses form by\nfreezing the structure of a liquid; but all amorphous solids are not glass1,2. The general\nprinciple underlying diverse glasses is the arrest of the kinetics of the first-order transition,\nwhich connects two symmetrically incompatible orders, freezing the higher energy state\ninto a non-ergodic state at low temperature. The concept of glass-like arrest of kinetics has\nrecently been invoked to successfully explain various anomalies in disorder broadened\nfirst-order magnetic transitions as a function of field and temperature for materials like\ncolossal magnetoresistance manganites5-8,10. These have long-range magnetic orders on\neither side of the transition. However, the high-temperature phase persists in the lowtemperature region where it is energetically unstable, and the lack of dynamics triumphs\nover thermodynamics. In pure systems, the first-order transition can occur along a sharply\ndefined (HC, TC) line in the 2-control variable (H, T) space. Due to disorders, different\nregions having length-scale of the order of the correlation-length can have different TC\nresulting in the transition line broadening into a band; as also do the lines corresponding to\nsupercooling (H*, T*) and superheating (H**, T**) limits12,13. Similarly, if the glass-like\nkinetic arrest is to occur below a (HK, TK) line for a given cooling rate in the pure system,\ndisorder broadens this into a band consisting of quasi-continuum of (HK, TK)\nlines5,7,8,10,14,15.\n\nBy traversing the 2-control variable H-T space, tunable coexisting\n\nfractions of arrested and equilibrium phases have been observed because of this disorder\nbroadening. Devitrification is an evidence of glassy state1-3 which is recently demonstrated\nfor such glassy magnetic state of variety of systems7,8,10,14. The present study focuses on a\n\n\f3\n\nhalf-doped manganite, La0.5Ca0.5MnO3, similar to the sample where Loudon et al. have\nproposed a 'nucleation and growth' process for transformation from high-temperature\nferromagnetic-metallic (FMM) to low-temperature antiferromagnetic-insulating (AFI)\nphase9. Coexistence of FMM with AFI regions at low temperature was shown, and here we\nexplore their origin and nature.\n\nPolycrystalline La0.5Ca0.5MnO3 sample has been prepared through a well-established\nchemical route known as 'pyrophoric method'. High purity (>99.9%) La2O3, CaCO3 and\nC4H6MnO4.4H2O are taken in stoichiometric quantities as starting materials. These\nmaterials are dissolved in aqueous nitric acid and the resulting solutions are mixed together\nwith triethanolamine (TEA). The complex solution is heated to dehydrate and decompose\nleaving behind organic-based, black, fluffy precursor powder. This dried mass is then\ngrounded to fine powder, palletized and then calcined at 10000C for 3 hrs in oxygen\natmosphere. The powder x-Ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out using an 18 kW Rigaku\nRotaflex RTC 300 RC diffractometer with Cu-K\u03b1 radiation. Rietveld profile refinement of\nXRD pattern confirms that the sample is in single phase without any detectable impurity\nand crystallizes in orthorhombic structure with 'pnma' space group. The resistivity and\nmagnetic measurements are performed using commercial set-ups (14Tesla-PPMS-VSM,\nM/s. Quantum Design, USA).\n\nFigure-1(a) shows the magnetization as a function of temperature measured in 1\nTesla field under various protocols. The hysteresis between field-cooled cooling (FCC) and\nfield-cooled warming (FCW) paths indicates a disorder-broadened first-order transition\nfrom FMM to AFI with reducing temperature. However, a substantial magnetization in the\nlow temperature antiferromagnetic phase, similar to Ref. 9, suggests the persistence of\nferromagnetic phase. Because of disorder-broadening of (H*, T*) and (HK, TK) lines into\nbands, the fraction of glass-like arrested state can be controlled by cooling in different\nfields5-8, 15. Based on the measurements similar to those reported earlier7,8 in the glass-like\nkinetically arrested magnetic systems, we propose that the AFI state is in equilibrium at\nlow temperature and the FMM phase fraction exists as kinetically arrested glassy or nonergodic state. We can collect larger fractions of glass-like arrested FMM phase at 5K by\ncooling in 6T field and then reducing field to 1T. This glass-like arrested FMM state\n\n\f4\n\ndevitrifies on heating as depicted in Fig.1 by the rapid fall in magnetization, of the 6Tcooled states, which approach the equilibrium AFI phase while warming. This half-doped\nmanganite should have the spin-aligned value of 3.5 \u03bcB/Mn accompanied by metallic\nconductivity9. The observed 1T-FCC magnetization of 0.61 \u03bcB/Mn at 5K can be attributed\nto a frozen FMM phase fraction of about 17%, which is close to the percolation threshold\nfor electrical conductivity. Hence, around this FMM phase fraction the drastic resistivity\nchanges are a more sensitive tool, compared to the magnetization, to probe small changes\nin the phase fractions. Figure 1(b) shows the heating and cooling cycles of the zero-field\nresistivity. Apart from the expected thermal hysteresis, the decrease in resistivity with the\ndecrease in temperature below ~ 70K reflects the presence of FMM phase fraction in AFI\nmatrix. Similar to magnetization, the zero-field resistivity also shows larger fraction of\nFMM phase when the sample is cooled in 6T (Fig. 1b). Different values of magnetization\nand resistivity in the same measurement temperature (5K) and field (1T for magnetization\nand zero for resistivity) indicate the presence of non-ergodic states. The concomitant sharp\ndecrease in magnetization and increase in resistivity, of the 6T cooled state, around 20 K as\nshown in Fig. 1 (a) and (b) results when this arrested non-ergodic FMM phase devitrifies to\nAFI phase on warming8.\n\nThis glass-like arrested FMM state resembles the conventional structural glasses in\nvarious respects. We now show that it partially crystallizes to equilibrium AFI state after\nannealing, similar to the route followed to produce nano-crystals within the metallic\nglasses or to the formation of glass ceramic1. Fig 2 (a) shows resistivity in zero-field while\nwarming after cooling from 320K in zero field and again after a temperature cycle from 5K\nto 140K to 5K without applying any field. The increase in resistivity after annealing to\n140K indicates that the system is ripening to its equilibrium state similar to crystallization,\nin this case to AFI phase at low temperature. For conventional systems such an effect can\ntake place from heterogeneous nucleation process. When contrasted with the initial cooldown, we now have an abundance of AFI seeds to trigger this process when energy\nbecomes available to the system16. It is well known that larger fraction of a glass can be\ndevitrified from a partially crystalline state by successive annealing1. Similar effect of\nsuccessive annealing at progressively higher temperatures has been observed in resistivity\n(as also in magnetization, not shown here). Fig. 2(b) shows the resistivity in zero-field at\n\n\f5\n\n5K as a function of progressively higher annealing temperature after cooling the sample to\n5K in zero field. Each temperature cycle to progressively higher temperature produces\nlarger factions of AFI phase and the system approaches the equilibrium state overcoming a\nhierarchy of barriers. Back conversion to FMM phase occurs, however, as the annealing\ntemperature is raised above 150K.\n\nWe now investigate whether the devitrification and heterogeneous nucleation is\ninfluenced by the initial glass-like kinetically arrested FMM phase fraction. This fraction\ncan be tuned by cooling in different fields8; is about 17% when cooled in a field of 1T, but\nrises to about 90% when cooled in 6T [Figure 1(a)]. This fraction remains fixed when the\nfield is reduced to zero at 5K. We show in Figures 3(a) and 3(b) the results of annealing to\n140K on these two cases. The initial higher FMM phase fraction for higher cooling field is\nevidenced by lower resistivity at 5K in zero field. However, after annealing to 140K the\nbehaviour reverses, the lower resistivity of the 6T-cooled state becomes much higher\ncompared to 1T-cooled state and exceeds the measurement range of the instrument below\n38K. Similarly, the 1T-cooled state, initially having lower resistivity compared to zero\nfield cooled state, shows higher resistivity after annealing to 140K [Figures 2(a) and 3(a)].\nThe effect of successive annealing on 6T- and 1T-cooled states is shown in Figure 3(c).\nAnnealing to temperatures higher than 80K clearly brings out a conversion to larger\nequilibrium AFI state when the starting glass-like kinetically arrested FMM phase fraction\nis larger. The effect is drastic for annealing temperature of 120K and beyond. This result\nmay appear counterintuitive but may have some connection with the folklore that \"hot\nwater can freeze faster than cold\"17 or the everyday experience that bigger pieces of glass\nare more susceptible to shattering when dropped.\n\nThe ease with which field (and temperature) can be varied contrasts with the current\nexperimental efforts involved in varying pressure (and temperature) to explore the energy\nlandscape of glassy systems11,18. Since TC varies strongly with magnetic field, so does the\ndifference between TK and TC; cooling in different fields allows us to arrest varying\nfractions of glass-like FMM phase without changing the rate of cooling5-8. Such glass-like\nkinetic arrest of first-order magnetic transitions, especially where the transition is\nbroadened by disorder, should enable studying the physics of structural glasses.\n\n\f6\n\nReferences:\n1.\n\nGreer, A.

After cooling the sample in 6T field the\nfield is reduced isothermally to 1T at 5K and M is measured while warming. The large\nvalue of M at 5K reflects a dominant arrested ferromagnetic phase, and its\ndevitrification starts around 20K. b, R vs. T while cooling in zero field from 320K to\n5K and again while warming from 5K shows the thermal hysteresis accompanying the\nfirst-order metallic to insulating transition. After cooling the sample in 6T field, the\nfield is reduced isothermally to zero at 5K and R is measured while warming. The low\nvalue of R at 5K reflects a large fraction of arrested metallic phase, and its\ndevitrification starts around 20K. Thus the high temperature ferromagnetic-metallic\nphase (FMM) undergoes a first-order transition to antiferromagnetic-insulating (AFI)\nphase at low temperature. However, multivalued M at 5K and 1T and also different\nvalues of R at 5K in zero field indicate the presence of non-ergodic states. Their\ndevtrification while warming is indicated by sharp changes in M and R around 20K.\n\n\f9\n\n\u03c1 (k \u03a9.cm )\n\n60\n\na\n\n40\n\nCooled and m easured\nin zero field\nInitialw arm ing\nW arm ing afterannealing\nat140K\n\n20\n0\n0\n\n\u03c1 (k \u03a9.cm )\n\n900\n\nb\n600\n\n100\n\n200\nT (K )\n\n300\n\nat5K & 0T\n\n300\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n100\n150\nA nnealing T (K )\n\nFigure 2: Resistivity as a function of temperature in zero field. a, Resistivity while\nwarming from 5K after cooling from 320K in zero field. Again the sample is cooled\nfrom 320K to 5K, then warmed to 140K and cooled back to 5K. Resistivity is measured\nwhile warming after this temperature cycle. The large difference in the resistivity values\nat low temperature, between the initially cooled state and that after annealing to 140K,\narises from the devitrification through the heterogeneous nucleation process. During\ninitial cool-down the entire sample was FMM and the AFI phase formed through\nhomogeneous nucleation. After warming from 5K and annealing at 140K, seeds of AFI\nphase enabled heterogeneous nucleation, reducing the residual FMM fraction. b,\nResistivity values at 5K as a function of annealing temperatures. After cooling the\nsample to 5K, resistivity is measured while cycling the temperature between 5K and the\nsuccessive higher annealing temperatures. Progressively higher resistivity values at 5K\nafter successive annealing indicate additional devitrification toward equilibrium AFI\nphase. This successive annealing produces higher resistivity at 5K than the single\nannealing shown in a. Annealing above 150K causes back conversion to FMM phase\nand resistivity drops. The cooling/heating rates and the temperature interval between the\ndata points are maintained all through these measurements.\n\n\f\u03c1 (k\u03a9.cm )\n\n10\n\n2\n10 a\n\nInitialw arm ing in 0T\nW arm ing afterreturn\nfrom 140K in 0T\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\nM easured in Zero field\nC ooled in 1 Tesla from 320K\n\n0\n\n\u03c1 (k\u03a9.cm )\n\n4\n\n10\n\n100\n200\nT (K )\n\nb\n\n300\n\nInitialw arm ing in 0T\nW arm ing afterreturn\nfrom 140K in 0T\n\n2\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\nM easured in Zero field\n\nC ooled in 6 Tesla from 320K\n\n3\n\n\u03c1 (~10 * k\u03a9.cm )\n\n0\n\n6\n\n100\n\n200\nT (K )\n\n300\n\nc\nCooled in 1T\nCooled in 6T\n\n4\n2\n0\n0\n\n50\n100 150\nA nnealing T(K )\n\n200\n\nFigure 3: Effect of larger initial fractions of the glass-like FMM phase produced after initial\ncooling in 1T and 6T on the single-shot annealing, and on successive annealing, is studied through\nzero-field resistivity measurements. a, We cool from 320K in 1T to 5K and then isothermally\nreduce the field to zero. Resistivity in zero field is measured while warming from 5K. The sample\nis again cooled from 320K to 5K in 1T and then after isothermally reducing the field to zero,\nwarmed to 140K and cooled back to 5K. Resistivity is measured while warming after this\ntemperature cycle without changing the field condition (maintained as zero). b, Resistivity in zero\nfield while warming similar to the protocol of a but this time the cooling field 6T is used during\ncooling from 320K to 5K. The lower value of R at 5K after cooling from 320K in 6T and then\nisothermally reducing the field to zero, reflects a larger fraction of arrested metallic phase. The\nlarge difference in the resistivity values between the initially cooled state and that after annealing to\n140K in both these cases, as in figure 2a and 2b, arises from the heterogeneous nucleation process.\nThe resistivity below 38K exceeds the measurement range of the instrument. c, Resistivity values at\n5K as a function of annealing temperatures. After cooling the sample to 5K once in 1T (and whole\nprocess is repeated with 6T), resistivity is measured while cycling the temperature between 5K and\nthe successively higher annealing temperatures. Progressively higher resistivity values at 5K after\nsuccessive annealing indicate additional devitrification toward equilibrium AFI phase. This\nsuccessive annealing produces higher resistivity at 5K than the single annealing of the respective\ncases, and the 6T-cooled case gives the largest AFI fraction. Its resistivity at 5K after annealing to\n130K, 140K, 150K and 160K exceeds the measurement range of the instrument. Annealing above\n150K causes back conversion to FMM phase and resistivity drops.\n\n\f"}
