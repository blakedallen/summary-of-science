It is also shown that this quantum\ncommunication protocol can be implemented in the spin-spin system on lattices.\nPACS numbers: 3.67.Lx, 3.67.-a\n\nQuantum communication, a way of communication\nbased on various features of quantum coherence (such as\nquantum entanglement and quantum non-cloning, which\nundoubtedly have no counterparts in classical worlds),\nare more reliable and efficient than any classical communication method[1]. Quantum teleportation [2] is one\nof the most remarkable protocols among those tasks\nof quantum communication, which completes the striking task of remotely preparing an unknown quantum\nstate of a particle without sending this particle itself.\nSince proposed by Bennett et. al, quantum teleportation\nhas attracted much attention from both experimentalists\n[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and theoreticians [8, 9, 10, 11]. Appropriate choice and measurements of entangled states are\ncrucial to the implementation of those quantum communication protocols.\nRecently, a novel kind of entangled states - cluster states was introduced with their remarkable properties such as maximal connectedness and persistency\nof entanglement[12]. They can be used to build a oneway universal quantum computer associated with only\nsingle-qubit measuments[13]. It was also pointed out that\nthose computers can be implemented physically since the\ncreation of the cluster states needs only the Ising-type\ninterations[12], which can be easily found in various condensed matter systems with proper spin-spin coupling on\nlattices[12] and even in the cold atom system in optical\nlattices[14]. Very recently, with an intrinsically algebraic\nconsideration, we generalized the concept of cluster states\nto the more general case with qudits (multi-level systems)\nand then demonstrate their quantum correlation features\nand the fundamental computational properties in many\naspects [16].\nIn this letter the cluster state is chosen as the source\nof entanglement to propose a novel protocol of quantum communication. The essence and functioning of this\nquantum teleportation scheme using the cluster state can\nbe viewed as an identity quantum logic gate, which was\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress:\nURL: http://www.itp.ac.cn/~suncp\n\nsuncp@itp.ac.cn;\n\noriginally used in the schem of measurement-based oneway quantum computers[12] only based on the cluster\nstate and the corresponding single quantum measurements. The advantage of this implementation is its scalability: a basic \"unit\" can be easily constructed for a\nsmallest (three-qubit) quantum logic network and then\nthis unit can be naturally enlarged to form a more-qubit\nnetwork. Moreover, this protocol can be realized in the\nspin-spin system on lattices, which physically guarantees\nthe scalability and implies that the communication can\nbe carried out from certain lattice sites to those at a long\ndistance. With those considerations we will explicitly\nbuild the quantum network for a quantum teleportation\nof N -qubits and N -qudits. We also analyze the entanglement and classical information costs to complete the\nteleportation task on a cluster.\nWe first view that the original procedure of quantum teleportation protocol mainly depends on quantum\nmeasurement with respect to four Bell states, the complete set of maximally entangled state of two particles.\nIt was discovered that the Bell states can be produced\nby a proper interaction from certain factorized states.\nIn fact, using the Pauli matrices \u03c3s (s = x, y, z) defined\nfor qubit states |0i and |1i, we write the tensor product operator[15] S ab = 12 (I + \u03c3za + \u03c3zb \u2212 \u03c3za \u2297 \u03c3zb ) acting\non particles a and b. Experimentally, this can be easily\nrealized as a time evolution governed byP\nthe Ising-type\n\u03c3za \u03c3zb for a\ninteraction Hamiltonian, i.e. HI = ~g\nb\u2212a=1\n\nspin-lattice systems[12] or a cold atom system in optical\nlattices[14]. Define |\u00b1is = \u221a12 (|0is \u00b1 |1is )(s = 1, 2, 3, ..).\nIt is easy to check that S ab transfer four factorized states\n{|\u00b1ia \u2297 |\u00b1ib ,|\u00b1ia \u2297 |\u2213ib } of particles a and b into four\nBell basis vectors |B\u00b11 (ab)i = \u221a12 (|0ia |\u2212ib \u00b1 |1ia |+ib )\nand |B\u00b10 (ab)i = \u221a12 (|0ia |+ib \u00b1 |1ia |\u2212ib ). Therefore, for\na given two particle wave function |\u03a6iab , the quantum\nmeasurements on its unitary transformation S ab |\u03a6iab\nwith respect to four states |\u00b1ia \u2297|\u00b1ib and |\u00b1ia \u2297|\u2213ib are\nexactly equivalent to a Bell-measurement with respect to\n|B\u00b11 (ab)i and |B\u00b10 (ab)i. In this sense the results of the\nsingle particle measurements on |\u00b1ia and |\u00b1ib will determinate the Bell-measurements on |\u03a6iab . We call this\n\n\f2\n\"two-step Bell-measurement\".\nWith the above observations we now turn to consider\nhow to teleport a state of a single particle located in site\n1 of the lattice to another particle located in site 3. Since\nthe controlled evolution governed by the above mentioned\n\"Ising\" type interaction plus the single particle measurements can realize a two-step Bell-measurement, a quantum telportation can be naturally viewed as an identity\nquantum logic gate on the one way quantum compute.\nTo be more concrete, we consider the simplest quantum\nlogic network which can implement the identity gate[15]\nshown in Fig. 1. There is a linear array of three sites\non lattice and three spins attached on these sites interact with each other through the \"Ising\" type interaction.\nFor this physical system we can propose our protocol of\nquantum teleportation using cluster states in three steps:\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nFIG. 1: The cluster for quantum teleportation of one qubit\nstate. The circle with the number n denotes the n-th qubit,\nand the two qubits connected by a line are neighbours. The\ngreen, blue and red colors are used to mark the input, body\nand output parts of the cluster respectively.\n\nI. Initially, Alice holds two particles 1 and 2 and let the\nparticle 1 be in an unknown state |\u03c8iin = |\u03c0(\u03b1, \u03b2)i =\n\u03b1|0i1 + \u03b2|1i1 (where |\u03b1|2 + |\u03b2|2 = 1) and the particle\n2 in the state |+i2 . Bob holds particle 3 in the state\n|+i3 . After an evolution derived by the Ising type interaction\nfor a length time t (governed by the equation\nR\n\u03c0 = g(t)dt), the unitary transformation S = S 12 S 23 on\nthe initial product state|\u03a8(0)i = |\u03c01 (\u03b1, \u03b2)i \u2297 |+i2 \u2297 |+i3\nwill result in a three particle entangled state |\u03a8(t)i. It is\nnoticed that, since S 12 commutes with S 23 , the unitary\ntransformation S can be decomposed into two independent sub-steps.\nII. Alice measure \u03c3x1 and \u03c3x2 for her particles 1 and\n2 in the single-particle basis |\u00b1i respectively and then\ntell Bob which (x1, x2 ) of the four possible results about\n(1)\n(2)\n1\n1\n2 (\u03c3x +1 ) and 2 (\u03c3x +1 ), where x1 , x2 \u2208 (0, 1) \u223c(+, \u2212).\nIn this sense the total wave function |\u03a8(t)i collapses onto\n|\u03a83 (t)i \u221d hx1, x2 |S 12 S 23 |\u03a8(0)i = hB\u03b7 |S 23 |\u03a8(0)i.\n\n(1)\n\n23\n\nThat is just the projection of |\u03a6(t)i = S |\u03a8(0)i onto\nthe Bell basis |B\u03b7 i = S 12 |x1, x2 i, where the role of S 23\n(which transforms the factorized state |+i2 \u2297 |+i3 to a\nmaximally entangled state 12 (|0i2 |\u2212i3 + |1i2 |+i3 )) is to\ndistribute an entanglement source to Alice and Bob.\nIII. According to this result (x1 , x2 ) Bob make an\n(\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2212 independent unitary transformation\nU\u03a3\u2020 = (\u03c3x(3) )x2 +1 (\u03c3z(3) )x1 +1\n\n(2)\n\non his particle 3 to obtain unknown state |\u03c03 (\u03b1, \u03b2)i =\n\u03b1|0i3 + \u03b2|1i3 for particle 3 exactly. In fact, according\n\nto the \"one way quantum computer \" theory[15], we\nhave the measurement induced output |\u03c8iout = U\u03a3 |\u03c8iin .\nHere, U\u03a3 is the extra rotation we should carry out in order to finish our task of teleportation. Since we measure\nparticles 1 and 2 in \u03c3x basis, U\u03a3 must belong to the Pauli\n(3)\nalgebra generated by \u03c3s (s = 1, 2, 3) and thus has the\n(3) x1 +1 (3) x2 +1\nform U\u03a3 = (\u03c3z )\n(\u03c3x )\n, which is determined by\nthe outcomes of measurement results (+, \u2212) in \u03c3x basis.\nThus a one-way unitary transformation U\u03a3\u2020 is sufficient\nto transform particle 3 to|\u03c03 (\u03b1, \u03b2)i \u223c |\u03c8iin .\nIt is noticed that the steps I and II together implement\nan identity quantum logic gate on the cluster. However,\nit should be emphasized that the quantum teleportation\ncannot be implemented only using cluster state and onequbit measurement. Indeed, the step III must be carried\nout, i.e. we should make a unitary transformation on the\noutput particle 3 to ensure that the state of particle 3 is\nexactly that one of particle 1. This is the main difference\nbetween quantum teleportation and quantum computation based on cluster state. In fact, in the measurementbased quantum computation, we only need the output\n|\u03c8iout = U\u03a3 |\u03c8iin (other than |\u03c8iin ) itself to readout the\nresult of computing. Finally we come to the conclusion\nthat, to implement quantum teleportation on a cluster is\nequivalent to realize an identity quantum logic gate on\nthe same cluster. Thus, our task remains to construct a\nquantum logic network to implement an identity quantum logic gate and find the explicit form of the unitary\ntransformation U\u03a3 in terms of the outcomes of the measurements.\nBased on the detailed analysis above, it is straightforward to suggest a general protocol for cluster-based\nquantum teleportation to transport multi-qubit information between the two sets of qubits located on the lattice\nsites with a long distance. Essentially, it is a general\nidentity quantum logic gate realized with a quantum network formed by a cluster plus the appropriate single particle measurements (as Fig.2). This cluster-based quantum network can be formally divided into three parts,\nthe input (I) unit with N qubits, the output unit (O)\nwith N qubits and the connection block (B)-the body\npart. When we input a N qubit state |\u03c8iin , the output\n|\u03c8iout = U\u03a3 |\u03c8iin is induced by the single qubit measurements performed simultaneously on all sites of I and\nB. This seems simple, but one should pay attention to\nthe corresponding problem of information cost. As wellknown, to teleport an arbitrary N -qubits states, at least\nN ebits (N entanglement pairs) and 2N classical bits\nof information must be used. Can we reach this tightly\nlower bound using an entangled cluster state? The answer is affirmative and we will also show how to build the\nquantum logic network to realize such quantum communication with the tightly lower bound of cost of information as follows. A one-dimensional chain cluster is sufficient to realize our entanglement sources. In fact, we can\nuse ordered indices to label qubits in the one-dimensional\ncluster of M (even number) qubits. Therein the qubits\nwith odd and even indices (odd- and even-bit)can form\n\n\f3\ntwo subsystems with M/2 qubits respectively. Then a\nmaximally entangled state can form between these two\nsubsystems. This conclusion can be reached by observing that, by measuring all the qubits with odd indices\nin the chain cluster with respect to the \u03c3z -basis, all the\nqubits with even indices will be projected onto the \u03c3x\n-basis. Then there is a one-to-one correspondence between the measurement result and the projection result.\nThus, we will have N -ebits of entanglement if we use a\none-dimensional cluster state of 2N -qubits and give the\nodd-qubits to Alice and the even-qubits to Bob.\nWith above general consideration for the information\ncost in the cluster-based teleportation of N -qubits, we\ncan embark on constructing a proper cluster to implement quantum teleportation of unknown N qubit state.\nWithout loss of generality, we consider the quantum teleportation of 2-qubit state on the six qubit cluster as\nshown in Fig. 2 (a).\n3\n1\n\n3\n5\n\n1\n\n5\n4\n\n4\n2\n\n7\n\n6\n\n2\n\n6\n\n5\n9\n\n1\n\n6\n\n10\n\n9\n\n2\n\n14\n\n11\n8\n12\n\n4\n\n22\n26\n\n18\n15\n\n11\n8\n\n25\n\n17\n\n10\n\n3\n\n21\n\n14\n\n7\n\n7\n\n4\n\n12\n\n13\n\n6\n10\n\n3\n\n13\n\n(b)\n\n5\n\n2\n\n9\n8\n\n(a)\n\n1\n\n11\n\n23\n27\n\n19\n16\n\n12\n\n24\n20\n\n28\n\n(d)\n\n(c)\n\nFIG. 2: The clusters for quantum teleportation of qubit\nstates. The circle with the number n denotes the n-th qubit,\nand the two qubits connected by a line are neighbors. The\ngreen, blue and red colors are used to mark the input, body\nand output parts of the cluster respectively.(a)The cluster to\nquantum teleport the state of qubits 1 and 2 to that of 3 and\n4; (b)The horizontal expansion of the cluster in (a);(c)The\nvertical expansion of the cluster in (a);(d)The lattice for general quantum teleportation.\n\nAccording to Ref. [15], the corresponding cluster state\nis defined by the following equations:\n\u03c3x(1) \u03c3z(3) \u03c3z(4) |\u03c6i = |\u03c6i,\n\u03c3x(2) \u03c3z(4) |\u03c6i\n\u03c3z(1) \u03c3x(3) \u03c3z(5) |\u03c6i\n\u03c3z(1) \u03c3z(2) \u03c3x(4) \u03c3z(5) \u03c3z(6) |\u03c6i\n\u03c3z(3) \u03c3z(4) \u03c3x(5) |\u03c6i\n\n(3)\n\n= |\u03c6i,\n\n(4)\n\n= |\u03c6i,\n\n(5)\n\n= |\u03c6i,\n\n(6)\n\n= |\u03c6i,\n\n(7)\n\n\u03c3z(4) \u03c3x(6) |\u03c6i = |\u03c6i.\n\n(8)\n\nThe above system of equation can be simplified as\n\u03c3x(1) \u03c3x(5) |\u03c6i = |\u03c6i,\n\u03c3x(2) \u03c3x(6) \u03c3z(6) |\u03c6i\n\u03c3z(1) \u03c3x(3) \u03c3z(5) |\u03c6i\n\u03c3z(2) \u03c3x(3) \u03c3x(4) \u03c3z(6) |\u03c6i\n\n(9)\n\n= |\u03c6i,\n\n(10)\n\n= |\u03c6i,\n\n(11)\n\n= |\u03c6i.\n\n(12)\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nFor the measurement pattern [15]{\u03c3x , \u03c3x , \u03c3x , \u03c3x },\nwe obtain the measurement result {s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 }. Based\non the theorem 1 in Ref. [15], we conclude that the realized unitary transformation in the two particle Hilbert\nspace of qubit 5 and 6 is an identity I . Correspondingly\nthe extra rotation U\u03a3 is\nU\u03a3 = (\u03c3z(5) )s1 (\u03c3x(5) )s3 (\u03c3z(6) )s2 (\u03c3x(6) )s3 +s4 .\n\n(13)\n\nAfter obtaining the measurement results through classical channels, one needs to perform the unitary gate U\u03a3\u2020\nin the output unit. Then the input state is determinately\nteleported to the output unit.\nWith the aid of the connecting natures of the cluster state, the above quantum teleportaion protocol for\n2-qubit state can be generalized directly to the case with\nN -qubit state. Along the vertical direction, we extend\nthe above cluster to that with 3N qubits, shown as in\nFig. 2 (c). After measuring Pauli operator \u03c3x in the\ninput unit and the connection block of the cluster, thereafter performing the proper unitary transformation, depending on the former measurement results, the quantum teleportaion of N - qubit state is completed from\nthe input unit to output part. Another way to extend\nthe protocol is to quantum teleport a state to a longer\ndistance through many medial qubits. Contrast to the\nabove extension along the vertical direction, we extend\nthe cluster along the horizontal direction as in Fig. 2\n(b). This expansion might be understood as connection\nof the basic units of quantum teleportation in sequence.\nThus, to complete such quantum teleportation, we also\nneed to measure \u03c3x for all the qubits in the input unit\nand the body part of the cluster, and then to perform\na measurement-dependent unitary transformation in the\noutput part. It must be emphasized that only the collective measurement results (more precisely, the sums of\nthe measured values of \u03c3x in every horizontal line) can\ninfluence the final unitary transformation in the output\npart. Accordingly, the classical information cost to implement this teleportation protocol for every one qubit\nstate is two bits, which is exactly the same as that in the\noriginal protocol suggested by Bennett et al[2].\nExtending the cluster in both vertical and horizontal\ndirections, we obtain a two dimensional lattice array of\nqubits as demonstrated in Fig. 2 (d). Obviously, the\nsame procedure as above can complete quantum teleportaion on this lattice. In addition, if provided with a large\nlattice of spins, we can chose the proper cluster by measuring \u03c3z to delete the redundant qubits from the lattice.\nThen, as long as the cluster for quantum teleportation\n\n\f4\ncan be formed in the lattice, we can teleport the state\nof the input qubits to the output qubits, whichever sites\nthey locate.\nSo far our investigation has centered in how to teleport\nthe state of qubits using cluster state. Then a natural\nquestion arises: Can we quantum teleport the state of\nqudits (d-level system) in a similar way? To teleport the\nstate of qudits, it is indispensable to generalize the concept of cluster state of qubits for qudits. Most recently,\nwe have just carried out this generalization successfully\n[16] and proved two useful theorems parallel to that in\nRef. [15]. With this generalization we can parallel propose the protocol of qudit based quantum teleportation.\nLet us begin with the simplest case-the quantum teleportation of one qudit state. We take a cluster of three\nqudits as Fig.1. The higher dimensional cluster state [16]\nis defined by\nX1\u2020 Z2 |\u03c6iC = |\u03c6iC ,\n\n(14)\n\n= |\u03c6iC ,\n\n(15)\n\n= |\u03c6iC ,\n\n(16)\n\nZ1 X2\u2020 Z3 |\u03c6iC\nZ2 X3\u2020 |\u03c6iC\n\nwhere the generalized Pauli operatorsZ and X are the\ngenerators of quantum plane algebra with q d = 1 [17].\nThe Z-diagonal representation of Z and X given by\nZ \u2261\n\nd\u22121\nX\n\n|kiqdk hk|,\n\n(17)\n\n|kihk + 1|,\n\n(18)\n\nk0\n\nX \u2261\n\nd\u22121\nX\nk=0\n\nfor qd = ei\n\n2\u03c0\nd\n\n.From Eqs. 14-16, we obtain\nX1 X3\u2020 |\u03c6iC = |\u03c6iC ,\n\n(19)\n\n[1] M.

[16] determines the unitary transformation on the third qudit U U\u03a3 . Here, U is defined\nby\nU X3 U \u2020 = X3\u2020 , U Z3 U \u2020 = Z3\u2020 ,\n\n(21)\n\nand U\u03a3 = Z3\u2212s1 X3s2 . To complete this quantum teleportation, one needs to perform a unitary transformation\nU\u03a3\u2020 U on the third qudit. Therefore, in the same way as\nin the qubit case, the above one-qudit quantum teleportation scheme can be extended to the quantum teleportation of N -qudit state , and even be extended to the\nquantum teleportation of qudit states through a large\ntwo dimensional lattice.\nTo sum up, we have universally proposed a novel protocol for quantum teleportation of qubits and qudits based\non cluster states. According to the analysis about the\nproperties of entanglement resources, a cluster composed\nof 3N qubits (or qudits) suffices to teleport a N qubit (or\nqudit) state. When the cluster is extended to form a two\nor higher dimensional lattice, this protocol of quantum\nteleportation can still work well.\nAcknowledgements\nThe work of D. L.
