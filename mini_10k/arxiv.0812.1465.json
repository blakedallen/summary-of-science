The default ATLAS strategy based on a weighting technique of the energy deposits\nin calorimeter cells is presented and compared to a novel technique exploiting correlations among\nenergy deposited in calorimeter layers.\n\n1. Introduction\nNon-linearity and resolutions degradation in energy reconstruction of hadrons by calorimeters\nresult from non-compensation effects compounded by unmeasured energy deposited in noninstrumented (dead) material. Calibration techniques are used to recover linearity and improve\nresolution.\nIn the year 2004 the ATLAS collaboration carried out a test-beam where a full central 2\nslice of the ATLAS detector was exposed to beams of electrons and pions a large energy range.\nOne of the main purposes of this combined test-beam was to test the ATLAS strategy to use a\ncalibration based on simulation to reconstruct the correct energy of pions.\nThe general long-term ATLAS strategy to use simulation to calibrate the detector response\nto hadrons is shown in [1], while the quality of the simulation for the combined test beam data\nis discussed in [2]. The result of these two inputs is shown in the present report.\nThe experimental setup and the real and simulated data samples are briefly illustrated in\nsections 2 and 3. The pion calibration techniques are illustrated in section 4. The performance\non simulation and data is discussed in terms of linearity and resolution in section 5.\n2. Experimental setup\nThe 2004 ATLAS combined test beam is shown in the sketch of figure 1. It was composed of a full\ncentral slice of the ATLAS detector extending for about three units in pseudo-rapidity 3 and for\n0.3 radians the azimuthal direction, \u03c6, around the beam axis.

The ATLAS central sampling calorimeters followed: one barrel module of\nthe liquid argon-lead electromagnetic calorimeter (LAr) with accordion shape was housed in\nits cryostat and put in front of three hadronic iron-scintillator modules (Tile) stacked in the\nazimuthal direction, orthogonally to the incoming test beam axis. The setup was exposed to\nbeams of particles (pions, protons, electrons and muons) in the energy range 1 to 350 GeV. At\n\u03b7 = 0.45 the material in front of the calorimeters is estimated to consist of 0.44 \u03bbint 4 and the\ncalorimetry stretches for about 9.5 \u03bbint : 1.3 \u03bbint for LAr and 8.2 \u03bbint for Tile. The LAr cryostat\naccounts for additional 0.6 \u03bbint in between the LAr and the Tile.\n3. Data and simulation samples\nThe data consists of samples of events in which positive pions impinge on the experimental setup\nat \u03c6 = 0 and \u03b7 = 0.45. They are summarized in table 1.\n4\n\nThe interaction length is calculated for protons.\n\n\fThe pion beams are generated from proton primary beams extracted from the CERN SPS\naccelerator: the resulting proton contamination is measured by estimating the fraction of proton\nevents that are necessary to reproduce the observed probability of generating a high energy hit\nin the transition radiation detector. The pion selection is documented in [2]. The proton\ncontamination required simulation of samples of pions and protons in the range 15 to 230 GeV\nwith GEANT 4.7 [3] using the QGSP BERT physics [5] list and a consistent description of the\ntest-beam set-up. The 4 million events simulated were split in two statistically independent sets\nof samples, the first one used for deriving simulation corrections and the second for testing the\nexpected performance.\n4. Pion calibration techniques\nAn incoming pion in the ATLAS detector causes a shower that is sampled by the seven\ncalorimeter layers of the combined electromagnetic and hadronic sections. Any hadronic\ncalibration scheme has to recover the intrinsic losses due to the invisible energy lost in nuclear\ninteractions. Additional imperfections in the reconstruction also need to be accounted for:\ncorrections are required for the imperfect energy collection of the clustering algorithm (outof cluster) and incomplete shower containment (leakage of neutrons, muons and neutrinos).\nFinally corrections for energy deposits in non-instrumented material have an important role.\nIn particular, in the ATLAS central region (barrel) a non-negligible amount of dead material\nis present between the electromagnetic and hadronic compartments i.e. in the midst of the\nlongitudinal development of most hadronic showers.\nTwo calibration techniques are considered. The default ATLAS local hadronic calibration\n(LH in the following) is described in detail in [1]. A novel technique (described in section 4) is also\nconsidered: it is based on the use of correlations between the signals at the layer level, summing\nthe clustered energy in each calorimeter longitudinal segment. It is called layer correlation\ncalibration (LC in the following). The ansatz is that hadronic and electromagnetic energy\ndeposits have different fluctuations properties and, consequently, variables that are sensitive to\nfluctuations in the total energy can be used both to derive all the corrections and improve the\nresolution of the total energy measurement.\nThe two techniques result in different outputs: LH produces calibrated clusters that will be\nused to form calibrated jets. On the other hand LC provides calibrated layer energies: such\nscheme is technically extendible to jets, but it will be aimed at calibrating the given jet energy\ndepositions in a layer.\n5. Performance of the hadronic calibration schemes\nPerformance is assessed in terms of linearity and relative resolution.\nThe total energy is fitted with a Gaussian in the [\u03bc- 2\u03c3, \u03bc + 2\u03c3] interval where \u03bc is the\nmean of the initial energy distribution and \u03c3 is its standard deviation. Linearity is defined as\nthe ratio of the expected fitted average to the beam energy as a function of the beam energy.\nRelative resolution is defined as the ratio of the fitted standard deviation to the fitted average\nas a function of the beam energy.\n5.1. Expected linearity and resolution for the LH scheme\nLinearity obtained with LH from simulated positive pion events is shown in the upper plot\nof figure 2. At the electromagnetic scale the typical linearity shape for non-compensating\ncalorimeters is observed: about 75% of the beam energy is measured and the linearity ratio\nincreases with beam energy due to the increasing electromagnetic fraction of the shower. The\ncompensation weights recover about 10% of the total beam energy. The small out-of-cluster\ncorrections account for about 1% of the beam energy. The remaining 10% is recovered by\n\n\f<E> fit /E beam\n\n1\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\nem\u2212scale\nweighted\nout\u2212of\u2212cluster\ndm\n\nATLAS Preliminary\n0.6\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n\u03c3fit /<E>fit\n\nEbeam [GeV]\n0.2\n\nem\u2212scale\nweighted\nout\u2212of\u2212cluster\ndm\n\n0.15\n\n0.1\n\nATLAS Preliminary\n0.05\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nEbeam [GeV]\nFigure 2.

Linearity is finally recovered within 2% for beam energy\nlarger than 20 GeV.\nThe relative resolution is shown in the lower plot of figure 2. Dead material effects are\nexpected to play a dominant role. The improvement in relative resolution deriving from\nsuppressing the various fluctuations is expected to reach 11% to 40%.\n5.2. LC scheme\nThe LC technique defines the total pion energy as the sum of clustered energy for each\ncalorimeter layer. The event-by-event layer energy corrections are defined as a function of a\nspecific pair of linear combinations of layer energies. Such combinations are the components of\nthe seven-dimensional vector of layer energies along the vector space basis derived by a principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) [4]: the two components are used along the basis vectors whose\nassociated PCA variance gives the largest contributions to the fluctuations of the total energy.\nIntuitively, the corrections depend on the \"directions of largest independent fluctuations\", Eeig,i ,\n\n\f150\n1.5\n\n100\n50\n\n1.4\n\n0\n\n1.3\n\n\u221250\n\n1.2\n\nweight\n\nEeig,1 (GeV)\n\n1.6\n\n\u2212100\n\u2212150\n\n1.1\n\nATLAS Preliminary\n\u2212150 \u2212100 \u221250\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100 150\nEeig,0 (GeV)\n\n1\n\nFigure 3. LC scheme: two dimensional look-up table of compensation weights for the first layer\nof the Tile hadronic calorimeter (see details in the text). Pions and protons samples are mixed\nto achieve a 41% proton contamination.\nwhere i is an integer from one to seven.\nBoth the weights aimed at compensating the invisible energy and the corrections aimed at\nrecovering dead material losses are derived as two dimensional look-up tables (seven for the\nlayer energies, one for the dead material correction). For both types of tables, Eeig,0 , the linear\ncombination of layer energies with the largest contributions to the total energy fluctuation is\none of the two dimension.\nEeig,1 , the linear combination with the second largest contributions to the total energy\nfluctuation, is the second variable for the calculation of the compensation weights. The weight\nfor a given layer energy in a given bin of the two dimensional table is defined as the average\nlayer\nlayer over all the events in the bin 5 . An example of the weight table for the first Tile\n/Erec\nEtrue\nlayer is shown in figure 3. The separation between the high weight region, dominated by invisible\nenergy, and the low-weight region, dominated by visible energy, is evident.\nFor the dead material correction, the second dimension is represented by, Eeig,2 ,the layer\nenergy combination with the third largest contribution to the total energy fluctuations 6 . The\nlook-up table is shown in figure 4 where the high dead material correction region is well separated\nform the rest. The correction is derived as a function of the normalized linear combinations\nmentioned above (each combination is divided by the best estimate of the total energy) and it\nis expressed as a fraction of the total energy itself.\nA small correction for the leakage, dead material energy losses upstream of the calorimeters\nand in between the first (presampler) and second (\"strips\") LAr layers is calculated by a\nparametrization obtained from simulation as a function of the total energy estimate Etot 7 .\nAn iterative procedure is then applied: a given total energy estimate provides a new dead\nmaterial correction which can in turn be used to determine the total energy. A few iterations\nare required to obtain a stable result.\n5\n\nSuch correction includes out-of-cluster effects as the numerator is the true total energy deposited in the layer.\nFor dead material corrections this combination is found to have the best expectedp\nperformance.\n7\nDM\nThe formula is Ef unc (E) = Cupstream (E)ELArpresampler +CLArpresampler\u2212strips (E) |ELArpressampler ELArstrips |+\nCleakage (E).\n6\n\n\f0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.35\n\n0.5\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.15\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\u22120.1\n\n0.05\n\nATLAS Preliminary\n\u22120.8 \u22120.6 \u22120.4 \u22120.2\n\n<EDM/Ebeam>\n\nEeig,2 / Ebeam\n\n0.7\n\n\u22120\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6\nEeig,0 / Ebeam\n\n0\n\nFigure 4.

Pions and prootn samples are mixed to achieve a 41% proton contamination.\nAll look-up tables are filled by the full set of simulated samples from 15 to 230 GeV so as to\nreduce the beam energy dependence of the correction as much as possible.\n5.3. Linearity and resolution for the LC scheme\nIn the case of the LC scheme a mix of pions and protons was used to derive the corrections and\nto simulate the data. The contamination values are those from table 1.\nThe upper plot of figure 5 shows the linearity obtained for both data and simulation: the\nagreement is within 2% at all stages of calibration. The resulting picture is similar to that\noutlined in section 5.1 for the LH scheme. The reconstruction at the electromagnetic scale is\naccounting for 75% of the beam energy. The compensation weights recover about 12% of the\nbeam energy while the dead material correction accounts for about 10%. The dead material\ncorrection for losses between Tile and LAr represents about 80% of the total dead material\ncorrections. The LC method recovers linearity within 3% over the whole energy range.\nThe relative resolution is shown the lower plot of figure 5. The simulation foresees a relative\nimprovement of 17 to 24%: the data behave consistently showing an improvement of 17 to 21%.\nEven though the relative behaviour is the same, the simulation underestimates the resolution in\nthe data by about 25%. GEANT4.9 [2] is expected to improve the data description.\n5.4.

Conclusions\nA simulation-based cell-weighting technique for hadronic signal calibration was applied to pion\nenergy reconstruction in 2004 ATLAS combined test beam for beam energy in the range 20 to\n180 GeV. A novel technique based on the correlation amongst layer energies was also used.\nThe linearity of response to charged pions is recovered within 2 to 5% by both approaches in\ngood agreement between data and simulation; compensation weights and dead material effects\nhave similar impact. According to simulation, the relative energy resolution is expected to\nimprove (by 20-30% to 40%). LC actually achieves an improvement of 17 to 21%. Simulation\nunderestimates data resolution by 10 to 25%; dead material effects are dominant.\nData-simulation discrepancies at the electromagnetic scale keep their size at all stages of\ncalibration, thus simulation performance is the limiting factor.\nAcknowledgments\nThe essential collaboration of Tancredi Carli, Karl-Johan Grahn and Peter Speckmayer is\ngratefully acknowledged.\nReferences\n[1] Pospelov G 2008, these proceedings\n[2] Speckmayer P 2008, these proceedings\n[3] Agostinelli S et al. 2003 Nucl.
