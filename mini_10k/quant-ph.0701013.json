It demonstrates the non-local nature\nof the theory in that an entangled system contains correlations that cannot be described by its subsystems alone.\nInstead these quantum correlations are attributed to the\noverall system [1]. Further, entanglement is an important resource in quantum information and computation.\nIn particular, solid state quantum computation has become a topic of much research and several proposals for\nphysical implementation have been investigated. The\nHeisenberg interaction is the model used in many physical applications of quantum computation, for example,\nquantum dots [2] and cavity QED [3]. It has also been\nshown that the Heisenberg interaction can be used to implement any circuit required by a quantum computer [4].\nTherefore, entanglement in one-dimensional spin chains\nhas been the subject of much interest. This entanglement has been studied both in the case of a finite spin\nchain [5, 6] and in the thermodynamic limit [7] where the\nlength of the spin chain becomes infinite.\nMacroscopic entanglement is a more recent concept. It\ndemonstrates that non-local correlations persist even in\nthe thermodynamic limit. This type of entanglement can\nbe detected by measuring macroscopic quantities such\nas internal energy and magnetic susceptibility [13] as it\nhas been proven that such quantities can be used as entanglement witnesses. It has been shown experimentally\n[14, 15], that the behaviour of observable macroscopic\nquantities such as magnetic susceptibility depends, most\nsignificantly at low temperatures, on entanglement. This\ndemonstrates that entanglement is vital in the explanation of how macroscopic materials behave. Macroscopic\nentanglement in a Heisenberg spin chain has been studied previously [7] only for a uniform magnetic field. The\nHamiltonian of this chain is used to construct an entanglement witness [8, 9, 10] which shows that entanglement\ndisappears for high uniform magnetic field just as it does\nfor high temperature.\nIn real systems, the magnetic field need not be the\nsame at each site in the chain. In solid state systems,\nthere exists a possibility that an inhomogeneous Zee-\n\nman coupling could induce a non-uniform magnetic field.\nMoreover, an experimental system is likely to contain\nmagnetic impurities. Copper Benzoate [11], [12] is a practical example of a system in a non-uniform magnetic field.\nIn this case, the alternating field is in a direction perpendicular to the uniform field. Alternatively, such impurities could be introduced artificially. Therefore, the\npossibility that such a field could affect entanglement,\nwhether to reduce or increase it, is an important subject\nto investigate. In reality, systems have a finite temperature so the thermal case must be considered. Hence,\nin this paper, we discuss the effect of a site dependent\nmagnetic field on thermal macroscopic entanglement in\na 1-D infinite spin- 12 chain. We also consider the zero\ntemperature case. Interestingly, we show that an alternating magnetic field can compensate for the effect of a\nuniform magnetic field at T = 0.\nThe Hamiltonian considered is\n\u0015\nX\u0014J\ny\ny \u0001\nx\nx\nz\n(1)\n\u03c3 \u2297 \u03c3l+1 + \u03c3l \u2297 \u03c3l+1 + Bl \u03c3l\nH=\u2212\n2 l\nl\n\nwhere J is the coupling strength between sites, and\nBl = B + e\u2212i\u03c0l b is the site dependent magnetic field.\nAlthough such a field is not likely to occur in nature, our\nwork allows us to investigate how a non-uniform magnetic\nfield affects entanglement in a model which is analytically\nsolvable. A similar Hamiltonian with cyclic boundary\nconditions has previously been diagonalized [16] using a\nmethod first set out by S. Katsura [17, 18]. In our discussions of a finite N -spin chain, we consider the case of\nopen boundary conditions with N even. In fact, these\nconstraints are no longer relevant in the thermodynamic\nlimit and hence our conclusion is unchanged if, for example, the cyclic model is used.\nTo identify entanglement in this system, we use an\nentanglement witness, i.e. an operator whose expectation\nvalue is bounded for any separable state. The power of\nour witness is such that we can identify the existence of\nentanglement even for a thermal system which is a mixed\nstate in general. Alternatively, single-site entropy can be\ntaken as evidence of entanglement when T = 0 since\n\n\f2\nthe total system is in a pure state. The purity of the\nsingle-site density matrix shows that the entanglement\nwitness is not optimal at absolute zero. Thus we find\nthat although the alternating magnetic field, b, acts in\ngeneral to suppress entanglement similarly to B and T ,\nat zero temperature, increasing b allows the system to be\nentangled for arbitrarily large B. Hence the effect of the\nstaggered field at T = 0 is to increase both the amount\nand the region of entanglement.\nEntanglement - A system is said to be entangled when\nits density matrix cannot be written as a convex sum\nof product states. For a pure state, dividing the system\ninto two subsystems A and B allows the von Neumann\nentropy to be used as a measure of entanglement. If we\ntrace section B out of the density matrix to find \u03c1A , the\nvon Neumann entropy, S(\u03c1A ) = \u2212Tr(\u03c1A log2 \u03c1A ), can be\ncalculated. S(\u03c1A ) = 0 corresponds to a separable state\nwhile when S(\u03c1A ) = 1, the system is maximally entangled. In the case of a mixed state, there is no unique measure of entanglement for a multipartite system. However,\nwe can construct an entanglement witness.\nAn entanglement witness [19] is an operator whose expectation value for any separable state is bounded by a\nvalue corresponding to a hyperplane in the space of density matrices. An entanglement witness is only a sufficient condition for the existence of entanglement. Hence\nfailure of the witness to detect entanglement does not\nnecessarily mean the system is separable. Though witnesses simply detect rather than give a measure of entanglement, they have significant advantages over other\nmethods. For example, they naturally incorporate temperature and many witnesses, such as magnetic susceptibility, can be experimentally measured [13].\nThe partition function and entanglement witness Many thermodynamic variables can be derived from the\nHelmholtz free energy, F = \u2212T ln Z, where Z is the par\u2202H\n, we see that\ntition function. As \u2202F/\u2202X = \u2202X\nP when\nz\nX = B, we obtain the magnetization M =\nl h\u03c3l i =\n\u2212\u2202F/\u2202B. In particular, we define the entanglement witness\n\u0011\n2 \u2202 ln Z\n1 X\u0010 x x\ny\nW =\n=\nh\u03c3l \u03c3l+1 i + h\u03c3ly \u03c3l+1\ni\n(2)\n\u03b2N \u2202J\nN\nl\n\nwhere \u03b2 = 1/T . Our witness, W, identifies a larger entangled region than witnesses found previously [7]. In a\nseparable state, it satisfies the bound\n|W | \u2264 1, which can\nP\nbe shown as follows. With \u03c1 = i pi \u03c1i1 \u2297\u03c1i2 \u2297***\u2297\u03c1iN , we\ny\ny\nx\nx\nhave |h\u03c3lx \u03c3l+1\ni+ h\u03c3ly \u03c3l+1\ni| = | h\u03c3lx ih\u03c3l+1\ni+ h\u03c3ly ih\u03c3l+1\ni| \u2264\nq\np\ny 2\ny\nx\nx\n2\nh\u03c3l i + h\u03c3l i h\u03c3l+1 i2 + h\u03c3l+1 i2 \u2264 1 for any l. The\nupper bound for the inequality is found by using the\nCauchy-Schwarz inequality and the condition that for\nany state, h\u03c3lx i2 + h\u03c3ly i2 + h\u03c3lz i2 \u2264 1. Thus, any state\nthat violates the inequality |W | \u2264 1 is entangled.\nDiagonalization of Hamiltonian - In order to find the\npartition function of the system, we must diagonalize\nthe Hamiltonian, Eq. (1) and find its energy eigenvalues. The open ended Hamiltonian can be exactly diag-\n\nFIG. 1: The surface |W | = 1 in the space of magnetic field,\nB, temperature, T , and alternating magnetic field, b.

We can now use Eq.\n(2) to calculate the entanglement witness for our system.\nThe region of entanglement detected by our witness\nhas been plotted in Fig. (1). The figure shows the region of uniform magnetic field, B, temperature, T , and\nalternating magnetic field, b, within which we always find\nentanglement. At fixed values of b, the entangled region\nof the T \u2212 B plane shrinks as b increases until a critical\nvalue is reached above which entanglement is no longer\ndetected. Consider now a plane perpendicular to the T\naxis. At zero temperature we see that until the critical\nvalue bc = 0.56, increasing b has no effect on the value\nthat the uniform magnetic field can take with the system\nremaining in an entangled state. Above bc , our witness\ndetects no entanglement. However, we later show that\nthis witness is not optimal at zero temperature.\nOur witness shows entanglement behaving as we would\nexpect physically. A high temperature causes the system\nto become mixed. Thus no quantum correlations can\nsurvive and the system is separable. Moreover, the effect\nof the magnetic fields is understandable as local operations which enhance classical correlations. When the\nuniform magnetic field becomes large, spins tend to line\nup in a direction parallel to that field. This clearly decreases quantum correlations in the system. Using the\nsame reasoning, if the alternating magnetic field is large,\nthe spins tend to anti-align which is also a product state.\nHence, as Fig. (1) shows, all of these parameters cause\nthe system to become separable if they are large enough.\nInterestingly, we find a counter example of this expected\nbehaviour and identify a region where the system is entangled even in a large magnetic field. We discuss this in\nthe following section.\nSingle-site entropy - When T = 0, the total system is\nin a pure state, i.e. the ground state. Thus, if the density\nmatrix of a single spin is in a mixed state, the particle\nmust be entangled with the rest of the spins. This can\nbe quantified using the entropy P\nof a single spin. The\nl-th spin density matrix, \u03c1l = 12 i\u2208{1,x,y,z} \u03c3li h\u03c3li i, can\n\nbe obtained from the total density matrix \u03c1 = e\u2212\u03b2 \u0124 /Z.\nMoreover, we find that the single-site density matrix is\nreadily diagonalized since h\u03c3lx i = h\u03c3ly i = 0. This follows\nfrom the fact that \u03c3lx and \u03c3ly are linear combinations of\nthe fermion operators \u03b1k , \u03b1\u2020k , \u03b2k , and \u03b2k\u2020 , all of which\nhave zero expectation values.\nIn the thermodynamic limit N \u2192 \u221e, the system is\ntranslationally invariant for all odd sites and for all even\nsites. Hence the single-site magnetization h\u03c3lz i can be\nobtained from the total magnetization M and the total\nstaggered magnetization Ms . In the limit of zero temperature, these are given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\u03a9\n1\u2212\n(7)\n\u03c0\nl\nZ\nX\nN \u03a9\n1 \u2202\nl z\nln Z =\nd\u03c9f (\u03c9)\nMs =\n(\u22121) h\u03c3l i =\n\u03b2 \u2202b\n\u03c0 0\nM =\n\nX\n\nl\n\nh\u03c3lz i =\n\n1 \u2202\nln Z = N\n\u03b2 \u2202B\n\nFIG. 2: We plot the entropy for an even site spin and an odd\nsite spin respectively\nwhen T = 0 and J = 1. Excluding the\n\u221a\nregion B > 1 + b2 , the single-site entropy is non zero and\neach spin is entangled with the rest of the system. The odd\nsite entropy shows a maximum when B = b + \u03b5.\n\n\u221a\nwhere f (\u03c9) = 2b/ J 2 cos2 \u03c9 + b2 and\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\u0011 for B < b \u221a\n\uf8f2 \u03c0/2 \u0010\u221a\n\u22121\n2\n2\ncos\nB\n\u2212\nb\n/J\nfor b \u2264 B \u2264 J 2 + b2\n\u03a9=\n\uf8f4\n\u221a\n\uf8f3\n0\nfor B > J 2 + b2\n\nTo\nobtain\nthese\nresults,\nwe\nhave\nused\nlim\u03b2\u2192\u221e tanh(\u03b2x) = x/|x|. By virtue of translational\ninvariance, h\u03c3lz i, is the same for all even sites and for all\nodd sites. Thus defining h\u03c3lz i = Tr(\u03c3lz \u03c1) = 2\u03b7l \u2212 1, such\nthat the single-site density matrix is \u03c1l = diag(\u03b7l , 1 \u2212 \u03b7l ),\nwe have\n\u0003o\n1 \u0002\n1n\n(8)\n1+\nM + (\u22121)l Ms .\n\u03b7l =\n2\nN\n\nFrom this, we can obtain the entropy of the l-th spin,\nS = \u2212\u03b7l log2 \u03b7l \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b7l ) log2 (1 \u2212 \u03b7l ).\nThe single-site entropy for odd and even sites is plotted\nin Fig. (2) with J = 1. In both cases, we find entanglement for various values of B and b even when the magnetic fields are large. The entropy, and therefore entanglement between each spin and the remainder\nof chain, is\n\u221a\nnon-zero everywhere except when B > J 2 + b2 . Hence\nentanglement exists when the coupling strength\nbetween\n\u221a\nnearest neighbour spins, J, is more than B 2 \u2212 b2 . We\nnote that this corresponds to when the square of the interaction strength is greater than the product of the total magnetic field on two adjacent sites. In addition,\nwe observe from Fig. (2) that the maximum singlesite entropy occurs when both magnetic fields B and b\nare zero. Introducing the magnetic fields reduces the\namount of entanglement in the system except along the\npeak in the odd site entropy. We find from the maximum entropy, Sl = 1, that the maximum\nentangle\u221a\n2 + b2 when\nJ\nment occurs in the region\nb\n\u2264\nB\n\u2264\nR\u03a9 \u221a\n\u03a9 \u2212 \u03c0/2 = (\u22121)l 0 b/ J 2 cos2 \u03c9 + b2 d\u03c9 is satisfied.\nThis corresponds to when the magnetization, M , is equal\nto the staggered magnetization, Ms . For even sites, there\nis only one solution to this at B = b = 0. For odd sites\n\n\f4\nthe zero temperature case, changing the temperature by\na small amount should not change its behaviour. Hence\nfor very low temperatures, we see that the entanglement\nwitness is not optimal.\n\nFIG. 3: Plot of the maximum entropy Sl = 1 for odd site spins\nwith different values of J. As the value of J increases, this\nmaximum entropy moves further away from the line B = b.\n\nhowever, this is satisfied for any finite uniform magnetic\nfield B at B = b + \u03b5 where \u03b5 is a positive value. The solutions in Fig. (3) correspond to the peak in the\n\u221a odd site\nentropy and so occur within the range b \u2264 B \u2264 J 2 + b2 .\nIn general, \u03b5 becomes larger as J increases as shown in\nFig. (3), and becomes smaller as B and b increase. We\nnote that the peak does not occur at B = b. As B\nand/or b tend to infinity, the amount of entanglement\nin the system tends to zero. Further, as the magnetic\nfields increase, the curves in Fig. (3) tend to the B = b\nline. At B = b, the system is no longer maximally entangled. At this point, we find from the Hamiltonian\nthat odd sites have zero magnetic field, and even sites\nhave field strength 2B. Hence at the peak, odd site spins\nhave a small magnetic field, \u03b5, while in comparison, even\nsite spins have a large field, 2B \u2212 \u03b5. The implications of\nthis peak are that even in the limit of large (though not\ninfinite) uniform field B, an odd site can be maximally\nentangled with the rest of the system if an appropriate\nalternating magnetic field, b is introduced. In practice,\nfine-tuning b to achieve maximal entanglement may be\ndifficult. However,\nfor any B, sufficiently increasing b\n\u221a\n(when b > B 2 \u2212 J 2 ) will create entanglement in the\nchain. Hence a staggered magnetic field can enhance the\namount of entanglement present in the system.\nAlthough the single-site entanglement relates only to\n\n[1] A. Einstein, B. Podolsky and N.

Lett. 87,\n017901 (2001)\n\nConclusions - Our best estimate for finite temperature\nentanglement is the witness which shows b reduces the\nregion of entanglement in the chain. That is, a staggered\nmagnetic field reduces the entangled region. If this behaviour is true even for an optimal finite temperature\nwitness, these results have consequences for larger scale\nquantum computation in solid state systems. As inhomogeneities in the magnetic field exist naturally in the Zeeman coupling between atoms, the region of entanglement\nis naturally decreased compared to when b = 0. Quantum computation relies on entanglement so as introducing b reduces both the temperature and uniform magnetic\nfield at which entanglement persists, our result shows it\nmay be more difficult than previously thought to construct useful quantum computers using one-dimensional\nsystems.\nOur entanglement witness is invaluable as by applying\nit to our system, it allows us to see how temperature affects the entanglement in the spin chain. However, the\nwitness does not tell us how the entanglement actually\nbehaves in the presence of B, T or b as it does not detect\nall entanglement in the system. Conversely, the singlesite entropy shows us exactly how the entanglement is\naffected by the magnetic fields at zero temperature, although it is unknown how to extend this entropy to a\nfinite temperature. Using this entropy, we have shown\nthat in the thermodynamic limit, a staggered magnetic\nfield enhances both the region and the amount of entanglement in our spin chain. Hence, both the witness and\nthe entropy are essential in characterizing the entanglement in the system. Further, the region of entanglement\nidentified by the witness is consistent with that of the\nsingle-site entropy. If the behaviour of the entanglement\nas shown by the entropy persists at higher temperatures,\nwe may be able to counteract any Zeeman coupling by applying an appropriate magnetic field, hence maximizing\nentanglement for odd sites. This will be an interesting\ntopic for future research.\nAcknowledgement - V.V. & J.H. acknowledge the EPSRC for financial support.\n\n[7] C. Brukner, V. Vedral, quant-ph/0406040 (2004)\n[8] M. R.
