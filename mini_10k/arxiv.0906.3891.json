Introduction\nThe main motivation of Arakelov to develop an arithmetic intersection theory was the idea\nof proving the Mordell conjecture by mimicking the proof in the function field case done by\nParshin [Pa1]. Let E be a number field. A central step in this program relies on suitable\nupper bounds for the arithmetic self-intersection number \u03c9 Ar 2 , where \u03c9 Ar is the dualizing\nsheaf \u03c9X = \u03c9X/OE \u2297 f \u2217 \u03c9OE /Z equipped with the Arakelov metric (see [Ar], p.1177, [MB1],\np.75), of an arithmetic surface X \u2192 Spec OE that varies in certain complete families (cf.\n[Pa2], [MB2], or Vojta's appendix in [La]). However finding such bounds turned out to be\nan intricate problem. The best results obtained so far give asymptotics or upper bounds\nfor \u03c9 Ar 2 on regular models for certain discrete families of curves as modular curves (see\n[AU], [MU], [JK1] and [K\u00fc2]) and Fermat curves (see [K\u00fc2]). Bounds for these curves have\nbeen asked for since the beginning of Arakelov theory (see e.g. [La], p. 130 or [MB2], 8.2).\nIn this article we improve the upper bound of \u03c9 Ar 2 for Fermat curves Fp of prime exponent.\nOur calculations rely on a careful analysis of the cusps behaviour above the prime p. This\nDate: November 21, 2018.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nCHRISTIAN CURILLA, ULF K\u00dcHN\n\nallows us to compute exactly the \"algebraic contributions\" of a formula for \u03c9 Ar 2 in [K\u00fc2].\nWe also take into account the difference between the minimal regular model Fmin\nand the\np\nregular model Fp constructed in [Mc], i.e. the minimal desingularisation of the closure in\nP2Z[\u03b6p ] of the Fermat curve xp + y p = z p with prime exponent p. This leads to the following\nresult.\nTheorem 0.1. Let \u03c0 : Fmin\n\u2192 Spec Z[\u03b6p ] be the minimal regular model of the Fermat curve\np\np\np\np\nFp : x + y = z of prime exponent and genus g.

In the forthcoming thesis of the first named author the more general case of\nFermat curves with squarefree exponents will be considered.\n1. Intersection theory for arithmetic surfaces\nWe start by reminding some notation used in the context of Arakelov Theory. Most of it\nwill be very similar to the notation used in [So].\nDefinition 1.1. An arithmetic surface X is a regular integral scheme of dimension 2\ntogether with a projective flat morphism f : X \u2192 Spec OE , where OE is the ring of integers\nof a number field E. Moreover we assume that the generic fiber XE = X \u00d7Spec OE Spec E of\nf is geometrically irreducible, i.e. X is a regular model for XE over Spec OE . We denote the\ncomplex valued points X(C) by X\u221e ; this is a compact, 1-dimensional, complex manifold,\nwhich may have several connected components. Actually we have the decomposition\na\nX\u03c3 (C) ,\nX\u221e =\n\u03c3:E,\u2192C\n\nwhere X\u03c3 (C) denotes the set of complex valued points of the curve X\u03c3 = X \u00d7Spec E,\u03c3 Spec C\ncoming from the embedding \u03c3 : E ,\u2192 C. For each s \u2208 Spec OE we define the fibre above\ns as Xs := X \u00d7Spec OE Spec k(s). We have X(0) = XE . Any point s 6= (0) will be called a\nclosed point and the corresponding fibre Xs a special fibre.\nLet f : X \u2192 Spec OE be an arithmetic surface in the sense of Definition 1.1. Due to the\nfact that Spec OE is Noetherian and that f is of finite type it follows that X is Noetherian\nas well.\n\n\fARITHMETIC SELF-INTERSECTION NUMBERS FOR FERMAT CURVES OF PRIME EXPONENT 3\n\nRemark 1.2. Since X is a regular Noetherian integral scheme, the divisor class group\nCl(X) of X is isomorphic to the Picard group Pic(X) (see [Li2], p.257: Corollary 1.19 and\np.271: Proposition 2.16). For any divisor D we denote the corresponding invertible sheaf\nby OX (D).\nDefinition 1.3. We set Cl(X)Q = Cl(X) \u2297Z Q. Obviously Cl(X)Q is a group again. The\ndifference is that we are now allowed to work with divisors with rational coefficients.\nLemma 1.4. Let f : X \u2192 Spec OE be an arithmetic surface and s \u2208 Spec OE a closed\npoint. Then\n1\nXs =\ndiv(h)\nm\nin Cl(X)Q , where Xs = f \u2217 s, h \u2208 K(X) and m \u2208 Z.\nProof: We know that the divisor class group Cl(Spec OE ) is finite and so we can find\na positive integer m and a rational function g \u2208 K(Spec OE ) with the property that\nm * s = div(g). Since X is regular it follows that f \u2217 s = Xs (see [Li2], p.351: Lemma 3.9)\nand so f \u2217 (m * s) = m * Xs = div(h) in Cl(X) for a h \u2208 K(X). Now, in Cl(X)Q we may\ndivide this equation by m and the lemma is proven.\n\u0003\nDefinition 1.5. Let D, E be effective divisors without common component, x \u2208 X a\nclosed point and f , g represent D, E respectively in the local ring OX,x . Then we define\nthe intersection number ix (D, E) in x as the length of OX,x /(f, g) as a OX,x -module. The\nsymbol ix (D, E) is bilinear and so we may extend the intersection number to all divisors\nof X (just write D as D+ \u2212 D\u2212 with D+ and D\u2212 effective and then define ix (D, E) :=\nix (D+ , E) \u2212 ix (D\u2212 , E)). Now let s \u2208 Spec OE be a closed point. The intersection number\nof D and E above s is then defined as\nX\nis (D, E) :=\nix (D, E)[k(x) : k(s)] ,\nx\u2208Xs\n\nwhere x runs through the closed points of Xs and k(x), k(s) denote the residue class field\nof x, s respectively. If it is clear from the context which intersection number we compute\n(above which s), we simply write D * E.\nDefinition 1.6. Let s \u2208 Spec OE be a closed point and E a vertical divisor contained in\nthe special fiber Xs . According to the moving lemma (see e.g. [Li2], p.379: Corollary 1.10)\nthere exists a principal divisor (f ) so that D := E +(f ) and E have no common component.\nSince (f ) * E = 0 (see. e.g. [La], p.58: Theorem 3.1.) we may define the self-intersection\nof E as\nE 2 := D * E .\nRemark 1.7. Another possible way to define E 2 can be done via cohomological methods\n(see e.g. [De]).\n\n\f4\n\nCHRISTIAN CURILLA, ULF K\u00dcHN\n\n2. Canonical divisors on an arithmetic surface\nLet f : X \u2192 Spec OE be an arithmetic surface in the sense of Definition 1.1. As f is a\nlocal complete intersection (see [Li2], p.232: Example 3.18.), we can define the canonical\nsheaf \u03c9X/ Spec OE of f : X \u2192 Spec OE (see e.g. [Li2], p.239: Definition 4.7.).\nRemark 2.1. Since the scheme Spec OE is a locally Noetherian scheme and f is a flat projective local complete intersection of relative dimension 1, the canonical sheaf is isomorphic\nto the 1-dualizing sheaf (see [Li2], p.247: Theorem 4.32.).\nDefinition 2.2. We call any divisor K of X with OX (K) \u223c\n= \u03c9X/ Spec OE a canonical divisor.\nThis divisor exists because of Remark 1.2.\nRemark 2.3. Let s \u2208 Spec OE be a closed or the generic point. For each fibre Xs \u2192\nSpec k(s) we get a canonical sheaf \u03c9Xs / Spec k(s) . We have the relation \u03c9Xs / Spec k(s) \u223c\n=\n\u03c9X/ Spec OE |Xs (see [Li2], p.239: Theorem 4.9). If s is the generic point we can define a\ncanonical divisor K of X := X \u00d7Spec OE Spec E in the same way we did with the arithmetic\nsurface. Similar to the relation between the canonical sheaves we get K|X \u223c\n= K.\nNow let E be a vertical divisor contained in a special fiber Xs and K a canonical divisor on\nX. Since any other canonical divisor is rationally equivalent to K the intersection number\nK * E depends uniquely on \u03c9X/OSpec E and not on the choice of a representative K. We have\nthe following important theorem:\nTheorem 2.4 (Adjunction formula). Let f : X \u2192 Spec OE be an arithmetic surface,\ns \u2208 Spec OE a closed point and E a vertical divisor contained in the special fiber Xs . Then\nwe have\n(2.1)\n\n2pa (E) \u2212 2 = E 2 + K * E ,\n\nwhere pa (E) is the arithmetic genus of E.\nProof: See [Li1] Theorem 3.2.\n\n\u0003\n\nLater on it will be important to construct the canonical divisor explicitly. The following\nproposition will help us with that.\nProposition 2.5. Let C \u2208 ClQ (X) be a divisor on X which satisfies the adjunction formula\n(2.1) and whose restriction to the generic fibre X is a canonical divisor of X. Then C is a\ncanonical divisor on X.\nProof: Let K be a canonical divisor on X (we already know that it exists). We want to\nshow that K \u223c C and so that C is a canonical divisor as well. We denote the horizontal part\nof the divisors by Kh and Ch . Since the restriction to the generic fibre of both divisors is\na canonical divisor of X we have K|X = Kh |X \u223c Ch |X = C|X and so there exists a rational\nelement g \u2208 K(X), which yields K|X \u2212 div(g) = C|X . Because we have K(X) \u223c\n= K(X), we\ncan interpret g as an element of K(X) and so obtain a principal divisor whose restriction to\n0\nX is div(g). We denote this principal divisor by div(g) as well. If we now set C := C+div(g)\n0\n0\nwe get a divisor with the properties that C \u223c C and Ch = Kh . Since we are just interested\n\n\fARITHMETIC SELF-INTERSECTION NUMBERS FOR FERMAT CURVES OF PRIME EXPONENT 5\n\nin C up to rational equivalence we may assume from now on that the horizontal part of C\nis the same as the one of K.\nLet s \u2208 Spec OE be a closed point and Xs the fibre above it. We denote by Ks and Cs the\nvertical divisor of K and C which have support in Xs . Since K and C fulfill the adjunction\nformula and have the same horizontal part we have\n0 = (Ks \u2212 Cs ) * (K \u2212 C) = (Ks \u2212 Cs ) * (Ks \u2212 Cs ) .\nand so Ks \u2212 Cs = qXs , where q is a rational number (see [La], p.61: Proposition 3.5.). Now,\naccording to Lemma 1.4, we find m \u2208 Z and h \u2208 K(X) so that Ks \u2212 Cs = qXs = mq div(h)\n0\nand so we have Ks \u223c Cs in Cl(X)Q . If we set C := C + mq div(h) we have just changed the\n0\n0\n0\ncomponents of C with support in Xs . Again, we have C \u223c C and now Kh + Ks = Ch + Cs .\n00\nContinuing successively with the other closed points of Spec OE we arrive at a divisor C\n00\n00\nwith C = K and C \u223c C as we claimed at the beginning.\n\u0003\nRemark 2.6. The Proposition 2.5 uses the fact that in Cl(X)Q the special fibres are\ndivisors coming from functions (see Lemma 1.4). In other words, the canonical divisor is\nonly defined up to rational multiples of the special fibres (in Cl(X)Q ).\n3. Arithmetic intersection numbers for hermitian line bundles\nDefinition 3.1. A hermitian line bundle L = (L, h) is a line bundle L on X together with\na smooth, hermitian metric h on the induced holomorphic line bundle L\u221e = L \u2297Z C on\nX\u221e . We denote the norm associated with h by || * ||. Two hermitian line bundles L, M on\nX are isomorphic, if\n\u22121\nL\u2297M \u223c\n= (OX , | * |) ,\nc\nwhere | * | denotes the usual absolute value. The arithmetic Picard group Pic(X)\nis the\ngroup of isomorphy classes of hermitian line bundles L on X, the group structure being\ngiven by the tensor product.\nDefinition 3.2. Let L, M be two hermitian line bundles on X and l, m non-trivial, global\nsections, whose induced divisors div(l) and div(m) on X have no horizontal component in\ncommon.

Theorem 3.3 is a generalisation, essentially due to Deligne, of the arithmetic\nintersection pairing, invented by Arakelov, where only hermitian line bundle, whose Chern\nforms are multiples of a fixed volume form, are considered.\nIf the genus of X is greater than one, then for each \u03c3 we have on X\u03c3 (C) the canonical\nvolume form\ni X \u03c32\n\u03c3\n\u03bdcan\n(z) =\n|fj | dz \u2227 dz,\n2g j\nwhere f1\u03c3 (z)dz, ... fg\u03c3 (z)dz is an orthonormal basis of H 0 (X\u03c3 (C), \u03a91 ) equipped with the\nnatural scalar product. We write \u03bdcan for the induced volume form on X\u221e and for ease of\nnotation we set\nO(D) = O(D)\u03bdcan .\nHere the norm of the section 1D of O(D) is given by k1D k = g(D, *) where g is the canonical\ngreen function (see e.g. [La]).\nDue to Arakelov is the observation that there is a unique metric k * kAr on \u03c9X such that\nfor all sections P of X it holds the adjunction formula\n(3.2)\n\n\u03c9 Ar .O(P ) + O(P )2 = log |\u2206E|Q |,\n\nwhere \u03c9 Ar = (\u03c9X , k * kAr ).

In Remark 2.6 we saw that the canonical divisor is only defined up to\nrational multiples of the special fibres. Because of formula (3.2) this indeterminacy will be\ndeleted by the norm of the section.\nLet Y \u2192 Spec OE be an arithmetic surface and write Y for its generic fiber. We fix\n\u221e, P1 , ..., Pr \u2208 Y (E) such that Y \\ {\u221e, P1 , ..., Pr } is hyperbolic.

Fermat curves and their natural Belyi uniformization\nFor the rest of this article we will consider the Fermat curve\nFp : X p + Y p = Z p ,\nwhere p > 3 is prime number, together with the natural morphism\n\u03b2 : F p \u2192 P1\n\n(4.1)\n\ngiven by (x : y : z) 7\u2192 (xp : y p ). Since the morphism \u03b2 is defined over Q, it is defined over\nany number field. It is a Galois covering of degree p2 and, since there are only the three\nbranch points 0, 1, \u221e, it is a Belyi morphism. All the ramification orders equal p. In [MR]\nMurty and Ramakrishnan give the associated Belyi uniformisation Fp (C) \\ \u03b2 \u22121 {0, 1, \u221e} \u223c\n=\n\u0393P \\ H. The subgroup \u0393P of \u0393(2) is given by \u0393p = ker \u03c8 where \u03c8 : \u0393(2) \u2192 Z/pZ \u00d7 Z/pZ\nmaps the generators of \u0393(2) to the elements (1, 0) and (0, 1).\nA ramified point, i.e. an element S \u2208 Fp that maps to one of the branch points, will be\ncalled a cusp. Divisors with support in the cusps having degree zero are called cuspidal\ndivisor.\nProposition 4.1. Let Fp a Fermat curve and \u03b2 : Fp \u2192 P1 the morphism in (4.1).\n(i) The group of cuspidal divisors is a torsion subgroup of Cl(Fp ).\n(ii) Let S \u2208 Fp (Q(\u03b6p )) be a cusp, then (2g \u2212 2)S is a canonical divisor.\nProof: The first statement follows from [Ro], p. 101: Theorem 1. So only the second\nstatement is left. By the Hurwitz formula there exists a canonical divisor with support in\nthe cusps. Then by (i) the claim follows.\n\u0003\n\n5. A regular model and the minimal model for Fp\nIn this section we are going to sketch the construction done by McCallum [Mc] of a regular\nmodel and the minimal model of the curve Fp : xp + y p = z p over S = Spec R, where\nR = Zp [\u03b6p ] denotes the ring of integers of the field Qp (\u03b6p ) and \u03b6p a primitive p-th root of\nunity. In order to simplify our computations we may consider the curve\nC p : xp + y p = 1\n\n(5.1)\n\nin A2S because the model, we are starting with, is just the normalization of the projective\ncompletion of Cp . It has just one prime ideal of bad reduction, namely (\u03c0) := (1 \u2212 \u03b6p )\nwhich is the only prime lying over (p); in fact since p is totally ramified in Qp (\u03b6p ) we have\np = u\u03c0 p\u22121 with an element u \u2208 Zp [\u03b6p ]\u2217 . Reduction modulo p gives us a p-tuple line which\nis non-regular. Moving this line to the x-axis, or in other words setting\nX = x and Y = y + x \u2212 1 ,\n\n(5.2)\nequation (5.1) becomes\n\n\u2212u\u03c0 p\u22121 \u03c6(X, \u2212Y \u2212 1) + u\u03c0 p\u22121 \u03c6(Y ) + Y p = 0 ,\n\n\fARITHMETIC SELF-INTERSECTION NUMBERS FOR FERMAT CURVES OF PRIME EXPONENT 9\n\nwhere\n\n(X + Y )p \u2212 X p \u2212 Y p\np\nand \u03c6(X) := \u03c6(X, 1). Now, by blowing up the line \u03c0 = Y = 0, one obtains a model which\nis covered by the two affine open sets: we introduce new variables a and b. Setting b = Y\u03c0 ,\nwe have U1 = Spec (R[X, Y, b]/(bY \u2212 \u03c0, F1 (X, Y ))) where\n\u03c6(X, Y ) :=\n\nF1 (X, Y ) = \u2212ubp\u22121 \u03c6(X, \u2212Y \u2212 1) + ubp\u22121 \u03c6(Y ) + Y ;\nsetting a =\nwhere\n\nY\n\u03c0\n\nthe second affine open set is U2 = Spec (R[X, Y, a]/(a\u03c0 \u2212 Y, F2 (X, Y )))\nF2 (X, Y ) = \u2212u\u03c6(X, \u2212Y \u2212 1) + u\u03c6(Y ) + \u03c0ap .\n\nThe geometric special fibre U1 \u00d7S Spec k(\u03c0) \u222a U2 \u00d7S Spec k(\u03c0) of this model consists\nof a component L (which is located just in U1 and associated to the ideal (Y , b) in\nR[X, Y, b]/(bY \u2212 \u03c0, F1 (X, Y )) and components Lx , Ly , L\u03b11 , . . . , L\u03b1r , L\u03b21 , . . . , L\u03b2s which intersect L and correspond to the different roots of the polynomial\nY\nY\n(X \u2212 \u03b2) .\n\u03c6(X, \u22121) = \u2212X(X \u2212 1)\n(X \u2212 \u03b1)2\n\u03b2 \u2208k(\u03c0)\n/\n\n\u03b16=0,1\n\u03b1\u2208k(\u03c0)\n\nThe L\u03b1i appear with multiplicity 2 whereas all other components with multiplicity 1.\nThere is also a line Lz crossing the point at infinity on L, which we cannot see in this\naffine model. There are just singularities left on the double lines L\u03b1i . Blowing up these\nsingularities we achieve new components L\u03b1i,j crossing L\u03b1i . All components have genus 0.\nFor later applications we define the index set\nI := {x, y, z, \u03b2i , \u03b1j , \u03b1j,k , . . .} .\n\n(5.3)\n\nLet us denote the model we achived by Fp .

If we now blow down the curve L (which is the only one with self-intersection\n\u22121), we get the minimal regular model Fmin\n(see [Ch], p.315: Theorem 3.1).\np\nRemark 5.2. A regular model over Z[\u03b6p ] can be obtained by glueing the model Fp over\nS and the smooth model of Fp over Spec Z[\u03b6p ] \\ {p}. We will denote this model as well by\nFp .\nSince we were just performing a sequence of blow-ups, the morphism \u03b2 : Fp \u2192 P1 extends\nto a morphism of arithmetic surfaces\n\u03b2 : Fp :\u2192 P1Z[\u03b6p ] .\nIn particular together with Proposition 4.1 we see that \u03b2 fulfills the assumptions of Theorem\n3.6. The rest of this paper is devoted to calculate the quantities ap in this theorem.\n6. Extensions of cusps and canonical divisors on Fp\nDefinition 6.1. We denote by Sx a cusp of the form (0 : \u03b6pi : 1); this abuse of notation\nwill be justified by the Lemma 6.2 below, which shows that the properties of Sx , relevant\nfor our considerations, do not depent on the exponent i. Similar we denote by Sy (resp.\nSz ) a cusp of the form (\u03b6pi : 0 : 1) (resp. (\u03b6pi : \u22121 : 0)). If we take the Zariski-closure of\na cusp Sx in Fp , we get a horizontal divisor, which we denote by Sx . Again, similar for y\nand z.\nFor any two divisors D and E of Fp we say that D intersects E, if supp D \u2229 supp E 6= 0.\nLx\n\nLy\n\nLz\n\nSx\n0\n\nSx\nSy\n...\n\nL\n0\n\n0\n\nFigure 2.

Let S and S be horizontal divisors of Fp coming from different cusps\n0\nS and S on Fp . Then the following properties are true:\n0\n\n(i) S does not intersect S .\n(ii) If S = Sx (resp. Sy , Sz ), then S only intersects the component Lx (resp. Ly , Lz )\nin the special fiber Fp \u00d7Spec Oe Spec k(\u03c0) (see figure 2).\n\n\fARITHMETIC SELF-INTERSECTION NUMBERS FOR FERMAT CURVES OF PRIME EXPONENT 11\n\nProof:\nFor the proof, we need to work with the explicit description of the regular\nmodel Fp . So if we talk about a cusp in the following, we will mean a point of the\nform (0 : \u03b6pi \u2212 1 : 1) ((\u03b6pi : \u03b6pi \u2212 1 : 1) resp.) which is just Sx (Sy resp.) after the\ntransformation (5.2). For any element in the ring OE [X, Y, b] (OE [X, Y, a] resp.) we will\ndenote by a bar the corresponding element in the ring OE [X, Y, b]/(bY \u2212 \u03c0, F1 (X, Y ))\n(OE [X, Y, a]/(a\u03c0 \u2212 Y, F2 (X, Y )) resp.).\n0\n0\nNow let S, S be two horizontal divisors on Fp associated with cusps S, S and let Q \u2208\n0\nsupp S \u2229 supp S be a point. We will denote by m the maximal ideal corresponding to\nQ. If the cusps lie above different branch points, for example S = (0 : \u03b6pi \u2212 1 : 1) and\n0\n\nS = (\u03b6pj : \u03b6pj \u2212 1 : 1), we have X, X \u2212 \u03b6pj \u2208 m. But then \u03b6pj \u2208 m which is impossible since\n0\n\n\u03b6pj is a unit. So let S and S lie above the same branch point. Without loss of generality\n0\nwe may assume S = (\u03b6pi : \u03b6pi \u2212 1 : 1) and S = (\u03b6pj : \u03b6pj \u2212 1 : 1). It is a basic result from\nnumber theory that (\u03b6pi \u2212 1)/\u03c0 is a unit in OE if i 6\u2261 0 mod p. We will denote this unit by\n\u000fi . If Q is a point in the fibre Fp \u00d7Spec OE Spec k(q), where q \u2208 Spec OE , then q \u2286 m. On\nthe other hand since X \u2212 \u03b6pi , X \u2212 \u03b6pj \u2208 m we have \u03b6pi \u2212 \u03b6pj = \u03b6pi (1 \u2212 \u03b6pj\u2212i ) = \u03b6pi \u000fj\u2212i \u03c0 and so\n(\u03c0) \u2286 m. Now if q is different from (\u03c0) and so in particular coprime to (\u03c0) we have 1 \u2208 m\nwhich gives us a contradiction again. It follows that the only possibility for Q to be in a\nspecial fibre is to be in the fibre of bad reduction Fp \u00d7Spec OE Spec k(\u03c0). Now since S and\n0\n0\n0\nS are E-rational points S and S are reduced to single points P and P in this fibre. A\ndirect computation shows that\n\u0011\n\u0010\nM = X \u2212 \u03b6pi , \u03c0, a \u2212 \u000fi\nand\n\u0010\n\u0011\n0\nM = X \u2212 \u03b6pj , \u03c0, a \u2212 \u000fj\nare the ideals corresponding to these points. If we take a look at the affine open set U2 ,\n0\ndescribed in the previous section, we can easily verify that M and M are indeed maximal\n0\nideals and that S and S are reduced to these points in the fibre of bad reduction since\n\u03c0 (a \u2212 \u000fi ) = Y \u2212 \u03b6pi + 1\n0\n\nand \u03c0 (a \u2212 \u000fj ) = Y \u2212 \u03b6pj + 1. Now if P = P = Q we have\n\u03b6pi \u2212 1 \u03b6pj \u2212 1\n\u03b6pi \u2212 \u03b6pj\n\u03b6pi (1 \u2212 \u03b6pj\u2212i )\n\u000fi \u2212 \u000fj =\n\u2212\n=\n=\n= \u03b6pi \u000fj\u2212i .\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\nand so \u03b6pi \u000fj\u2212i \u2208 m. But since \u03b6pi \u000fj\u2212i \u2208 OE\u2217 , this gives us a contradiction and we have\ncompleted the proof of (i).\nNow let S = (0 : \u03b6pi \u2212 1 : 1), so S is Sx after the transformation (5.2). Again S \u2229 Fp \u00d7Spec OE\nSpec k(\u03c0) is reduced to a single point P . Let M be the corresponding maximal ideal, so\nM = (X, \u03c0, a \u2212 \u000fi ). The irreducible component Lx corresponds (in U2 ) to the prime ideal\nI = (\u03c0, X). Obviously I \u2282 M and so P is just in the component Lx in the fibre of bad\n\n\f12\n\nCHRISTIAN CURILLA, ULF K\u00dcHN\n\nreduction (remember that the component L does not lie in U2 ). Since S is only reduced to\nP it only intersects Lx . Similar computations for Sy and Sz yield (ii).\n\u0003\nLemma 6.3. Let Fp \u2192 Spec OE be the arithmetic surface constructed above. There exists\na canonical divisor C \u2208 Cl(Fp )Q = Cl(Fp ) \u2297Z Q on Fp of the form\nC = (2g \u2212 2)S + V ,\nwhere S is a horizontal divisor coming from a cusp, g = g(Fp ) is the genus of Fp and V\ndenotes a vertical divisor having support in the special fibre Fp \u00d7Spec OE Spec k(\u03c0).\nProof: It follows from Proposition 4.1 that\n(2g \u2212 2)S\nis a canonical divisor in Cl(Fp )Q , where S is any cusp. If we now set\nC0 := (2g \u2212 2)S + V0 ,\nwhere S is the Zariski closure of S and V0 is a sum of divisors, having support in the closed\nfibres, so that C0 fulfills the adjunction formula, then C0 is a canonical divisor of Fp (see\nProposition 2.5). Note that similar arguments, as in the proof of Proposition 2.5, assure\nthat V0 exists. For all primes q \u2208 Spec OE not dividing p - in fact these are the primes\nof good reduction - the special fibre Fp \u00d7Spec OE Spec k(q) is smooth and so it consists of\na single irreducible component. Since the self-intersection of this fibre is zero (see [La]:\np.61: Proposition 3.5.) we can add any multiple of it to C0 and the resulting divisor\nstill fulfills the adjunction formula. Using this fact we can transform C0 into a divisor\nC = (2g \u2212 2)S + V, where V is a vertical divisor having support in the special fibre over \u03c0.\nAgain, by Proposition 2.5, this is a canonical divisor.\n\u0003\nNow we are ready to compute the canonical divisor for the model Fp . In the previous\nlemma we saw that such a divisor can be constructed with a horizontal divisor S coming\nfrom a cusp and vertical divisors having support in the fibres of bad reduction.

Notice that L is not included in Cx , since it is modulo the full fiber\njust a linear combination of the other components.\nLemma 6.4. The divisor Cx in (6.6) is indeed a canonical divisor.\nProof: From Lemma 6.3 we know that there exists a canonical divisor of the form (6.6)\nwith (6.1) and (6.2) for some coefficients \u03bb. The only thing we need to do is to show that\nfor these \u03bb is no other choice possible than the one we made in (6.3), (6.4) and (6.5). So\nthe whole idea of the proof is the repeating use of the adjunction formula (see [Li2], p.390:\nTheorem 1.37) combined with the fact that the genus of the components of the special\nfibre is zero (see [Mc], p.59: Theorem 3) to approve the choice we made. We start with\nthe observation\n(6.7)\n\n2\u03bb\u03b1i,j = \u03bb\u03b1i .\n\nIndeed, according to the adjunction formula L2\u03b1i,j + Cx * L\u03b1i,j = 2g(L\u03b1i,j ) \u2212 2 and L2\u03b1i,j = \u22122\n(see previous section), we have\n!\np\nX\n\u03bb\u03b1i,j L\u03b1i,j + \u03bb\u03b1i L\u03b1i = \u03bb\u03b1i,j (\u22122) + \u03bb\u03b1i .\n0 = L\u03b1i,j * Cx = L\u03b1i,j *\nl=1\n\nNow using (6.7) and the formula for L\u03b1i , we get\np \u2212 2 = L \u03b1i * C x =\n\np\nX\n\np\np\n\u03bb\u03b1i,j + \u03bb\u03b1i (\u2212p) = \u03bb\u03b1i \u2212 p\u03bb\u03b1i = \u2212 \u03bb\u03b1i .\n2\n2\nj=1\n\nSimilar computations yield \u03bby , \u03bbz and the \u03bb\u03b2i . Finally, one observes that\np \u2212 2 = Cx * Lx = (2g \u2212 2)Sx * Lx + \u03bbx L2x = (2g \u2212 2) + \u03bbx (\u2212p)\nand with this we finish our proof.\n\n\u0003\n\nWith a view to this lemma we see that the vertical part of two divisors coming from cusps\nthat lie over different branch points, say Cx and Cy , just differs in the parts Vx and Vy .\n7. The algebraic contributions to \u03c9 Ar 2\nWe now calculate certain intersection numbers, which will be used later to complete the\ncomputations of the coefficient ap .\nLemma 7.1. For V\u03a3 given in (6.2) we have\n\u0012\nV\u03a3 * V\u03a3 = (p \u2212 3)(\u2212p)\n\np\u22122\np\n\n\u00132\n.\n\n\f14\n\nCHRISTIAN CURILLA, ULF K\u00dcHN\n\nProof: In all the computations in this proof we have to remember the coefficients we\ncalculated in Lemma 6.4. If we write V\u03a3 = V\u03a3\u03b1 + V\u03a3\u03b2 , where V\u03a3\u03b1 denotes the part coming\nfrom the L\u03b1 and V\u03a3\u03b2 the part coming from the L\u03b2 , we have\nV\u03a3 * V\u03a3 = V\u03a3\u03b1 * V\u03a3\u03b1 + V\u03a3\u03b2 * V\u03a3\u03b2 ,\nsince each of the components of V\u03a3\u03b1 does not intersect any component of V\u03a3\u03b2 and vice\nversa. From figure 1 we see that each L\u03b2i just intersects itself and that the number of\nself-intersection is \u2212p. Since there are s lines L\u03b2i , we have\n\u0012\n\u00132\np\u22122\nV\u03a3\u03b2 * V\u03a3\u03b2 = s(\u2212p)\n.\np\nNow let C be a canonical divisor. According to the adjunction formula, we have C *L\u03b1i,j = 0\nand, since each L\u03b1i,j just intersects the V\u03a3\u03b1 part of C, the equation 0 = C *L\u03b1i,j = V\u03a3\u03b1 *L\u03b1i,j .\nThis yields\nr\nr\nX\nX\nV\u03a3\u03b1 * V\u03a3\u03b1 = V\u03a3\u03b1 *\n\u03bb\u03b1i L\u03b1i =\n\u03bb\u03b1i (V\u03a3\u03b1 * L\u03b1i ) ,\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nwhere each addend is\np\nX\n\n\u03bb\u03b1i (V\u03a3\u03b1 * L\u03b1i ) = \u03bb\u03b1i\n\n!\n\n!\n\u03bb\u03b1i,j L\u03b1i,j + \u03bb\u03b1i L\u03b1i\n\n* L \u03b1i\n\ni=1\n\n\u0010p\n\n\u0011\n\u03bb\u03b1 + \u03bb\u03b1i (\u2212p)\n= \u03bb\u03b1i\n2 i\n\u0012\n\u00132\np\u22122\np 2\n.\n= \u2212 \u03bb\u03b1i = 2(\u2212p)\n2\np\nSince there are r lines L\u03b1i , we have\n\u0012\nV\u03a3 * V\u03a3 = (2r + s)(\u2212p)\n\np\u22122\np\n\n\u00132\n\n\u0012\n= (p \u2212 3)(\u2212p)\n\np\u22122\np\n\n\u00132\n\u0003\n\nLemma 7.2.

Since Pic(P1E ) \u223c\n=Z\nand OP1E (1) is a generator of Pic(P1E ) any divisor of degree 1 is associated with OP1E (1).\nWe choose Q to be this associated divisor. Now\np\nX\n\u2217\npSi ,\n\u03b2 Q=\ni=1\n\nwhere Si runs through the cusps lying above Q. If follows from [Ro], p.101: Theorem\n1. that \u03b2 \u2217 Q \u223c p2 Sx in Cl(Fp )Q (remember that Sx is one of the cusps) and so p2 Sx is\nassociated with \u03b2 \u2217 OP1E (1). Since \u03b2 \u2217 OP1O (1)|Fp \u223c \u03b2 \u2217 OP1E (1) it is clear with Lemma 1.4 that\nE\nwe can choose Dx = Sx + Gx where Gx is a vertical divisor having support in the special\nfibre Fp \u00d7Spec OE Spec k(\u03c0). Now let I be the index set from (5.3). Since each component\nof the special fibre which is different to L is mapped to a single point by \u03b2, we have\n(p2 Dx ) * Li = 0 (\u2200i \u2208 I)\n\n(7.2)\n\n(see [Li2], p. 398: Theorem 2.12 (a) ). On the other hand we have\n(7.3)\n\np2 = p2 Dx * Fp \u00d7Spec OE Spec k(\u03c0) = p2 Dx * L\n\n(see [Li2], p. 388: Remark 1.31.). Solving (7.2) and (7.3) we get Gx = p1 Lx .\n\n\u0003\n\nTheorem 7.4. Let Cx = (2g \u2212 2)(Sx + Fx ) be a canonical divisors and Dx = Sx + Gx a\ndivisors as in (7.1), where x indicates that this divisor belongs to a cusp Sx . Then\nFx * Fx = \u2212 p\nProof: We have Fx2 =\n\n1\n(2g\u22122)2\n\n3 \u22127p2 +15p\u22128\n\np2 (p\u22123)2\n\n,\n\nSx * Gx = \u2212(Gx * Gx ) =\n\n1\np\n\n.\n\n(Vx2 + V\u03a32 ). Now Lemma 7.1 and Lemma 7.2 together with\n\ng = (p\u22121)(p\u22122)\nyield (after simplifying equations) our first claim.\n2\nWith equation (7.2) we get Sx * Gx = \u2212(Gx * Gx ). Since Gx = p1 Lx the second claim follows.\n\u0003\nNow, we successfully prepared all the ingredients to actually calculate some intersection\nnumbers for the Fermat curves.\n8.

Since \u03b2 \u221e = i=1 pSi we have bj = bmax = p. The morphism \u03b2 is of\ndegree p2 .

In Section 5 we have seen that we get a minimal regular model Fmin\nof Fp\np\ndenote\nthis\nif we blow down the component L of the special fibre. Let \u03c0 : Fp \u2192 Fmin\np\nblow-down. Then there exists a vertical divisor W on Fp (with support in the special fibre)\nsuch that \u03c0 \u2217 \u03c9Fmin\n= \u03c9Fp \u2297 O(W).

With the notation from above we have\n2\u03c9Fp * O(W) + O(W)2 = (2p2 \u2212 10p + 13) log p.\nProof: We start by computing the canonical divisor Kxmin of Fmin\np , so the divisor with\nmin \u223c\nO(Kx ) = \u03c9Fmin\n. Let L\u0303u := \u03c0Lu , where u \u2208 I and I is the index set (5.3). In order to\np\ncompute intersections of the L\u0303u we need to find their pullback and then compute everything\non Fp . We have \u03c0 \u2217 L\u0303u = Lu for u = \u03b1i,j and\n\u03c0 \u2217 L\u0303u = Lu + L\nfor all other u. Indeed, let for instance u = x. Then we have \u03c0 \u2217 L\u0303x = Lx + \u03bcx L, where \u03bcx\nis a rational number. It follows that 0 = L * \u03c0 \u2217 L\u0303x = 1 \u2212 \u03bcx (see [Li2], p.398: Theorem 2.12.\n(a)).\nThe canonical divisor on Fmin\nis given by\np\n1\nKxmin = (2g \u2212 2)(Sx + L\u0303x ) .\np\nTo verify this we just need to proof that Kxmin satisfies the adjunction formula and restricts\nto the canonical divisor Kx of the generic fibre Fp (see Proposition 2.5). The second\nproperty is obviously fulfilled. In order to verify the adjunction formula one has to check\nthat it is valid for each irreducible component of the special fibre. We will illustrate this\n\n\fARITHMETIC SELF-INTERSECTION NUMBERS FOR FERMAT CURVES OF PRIME EXPONENT 17\n\nfor the component L\u0303x and leave the rest to the reader since the computations are very\nsimilar.
