Germany\nAbstract\nCanonical quantisation of the free-field zero modes q, p on a half-line p > 0 provides for WZNW coset\ntheories self-adjoint vertex operators on account of hidden symmetries generated by an S-matrix.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe cosets of the SL(2, R) WZNW model, the Liouville theory as well as the SL(2, R)/R+ and SL(2, R)/U (1)\nblack hole models, are classically completely described by gauge invariant Hamiltonian reduction. This is\nreviewed in [1]. A canonical quantisation can be performed in the same way as it has been done for the\nLiouville theory in [2, 3]. Here one uses the general solution of the coset as a canonical transformation\nbetween the non-linear coset fields and free fields, replaces the Poisson brackets of the canonical free fields\nby commutators, normal orders non-linear expressions in the free fields, and avoids ensuing anomalies by\ndeforming the composite operators of the coset theories [2, 3, 4].\nOur aim is to construct vertex operators for the calculation of coset correlation functions. However the\ncoset dynamics restricts the free-field zero modes q, p to the half-line p > 0 where the coordinate operator\nq\u0302 = i~\u2202p is not self-adjoint. We can expect that the vertex operators which contain e\u00b1\u03b3 q\u0302 , nevertheless, act\nself-adjointly on L2 (R+ ) due to symmetries provided by S-matrix transformations of the respective coset\ntheory.\nQuantum Liouville theory is the simplest example, and it proves to be fundamental for an understanding of the quantisation of all the other WZNW cosets. It is therefore appropriate to restrict this short\ncontribution exclusively to the Liouville theory. Since its zero mode structure is basically Liouville particle\ndynamics, we shall give first a full description of the particle model. Guided by this structure we then\ndescribe the problem for the deformed field theoretical situation [5], which refers to the Liouville oscillator\nvacuum only. It might be worth mentioning here that the Liouville S-matrix corresponds to a particular\nM\u00f6bius transformation, which therefore leaves the Liouville field invariant. The various cosets differ even\nin this respect by technical peculiarities only.\n\n2\n\nLiouville particle dynamics\n\nThe Liouville vacuum configurations are described by a homogeneous field \u2202\u03c3 \u03c6(\u03c4, \u03c3) = 0 which becomes\na time dependent coordinate \u03c6(\u03c4, \u03c3) = Q(\u03c4 ).

The in- and out-variables are related by the\ntransformation\np\n2\n(9)\nQout = \u2212q + log ,\nPout = \u2212p,\n\u03b3\n\u03c9\n\nwhich combines the reflection of p, q with a simple canonical map. It is an important observation that\nthe general solution (5) is invariant under the transformation (9). Quantum mechanically this symmetry\nwill be generated by the S-matrix of the particle theory (16).

So we have to establish\na connection between the Q-representation and the standard p-representation on the half-plane. Wave\nfunctions of the p-representation are \u03c8(p) \u2208 L2 (R+ ) and the operators e\u00b1\u03b3 q\u0302 can be defined as\ne\u00b1\u03b3 q\u0302 = e\u00b1(i~\u03b3\u2202p +\u03bb) ,\n\n(28)\n\nwith some constant \u03bb. Due to (6) the eigenstates of (12) | \u03a8k i can also be identified with the eigenstates\nof the momentum operator p\u0302 | \u03a8k i = ~\u03b3 k| \u03a8k i. This identification connects the wave functions \u03c8(p) with\nwave functions of the Q-representation \u03a8(x) by\n\u03c8(p) =\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndx \u03a8\u2217k (x) \u03a8(x),\n\nfor\n\np = ~\u03b3 k.\n\n(29)\n\nSince the eigenstates |\u03a8k i are complete this transformation is unitary.\nLet us now consider as the simplest non-trivial example the vertex operator V\u0302 (\u03c4 ). Its matrix elements\ncorrespond to the case n = 1 of (27)\n!\n\u2032\ne\u03b1(k+k )\u03c4\nm\n\u2212\u03b1(k+k \u2032 )\u03c4\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\ne\n\u03b4(k \u2212 k \u2212 i) +\nV (k, k ; \u03c4 ) =\n\u03b4(k \u2212 k + i), .\n(30)\n\u03b1\n4kk\u2032\nFrom this expression one can easily read off the zero mode operator structure\n\u03b3 p\u0302\n\n\u03b3 p\u0302\n\n\u03b3 p\u0302\n\nV\u0302 (\u03c4 ) = e\u2212 4\u03c0 \u03c4 e\u2212\u03b3 q\u0302 e\u2212 4\u03c0 \u03c4 + \u03c9 2\n\n4\n\n\u03b3 p\u0302\n\ne 4\u03c0 \u03c4 \u03b3 q\u0302 e 4\u03c0 \u03c4\ne\n.\np\u0302\np\u0302\n\n(31)\n\n\f\u03b1\n). One can show that the vertex operator V\u0302\u2212n is the n-th\nThis fixes the parameter \u03bb of (28) as \u03bb = log( m\npower of (31), but for positive or non-integer negative 2b V\u03022b is given by an infinite series of q-exponentials,\nmuch as in quantum Liouville field theory [2, 5].\nIt remains to consider the self-adjoint action of the vertex operator (31) on L2 (R+ ). Since asymptotically for \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b1\u221e only one term survives one is tempted to demand hermiticity for each term of\n(31) separately. But a proof of hermiticity for e\u03b3 q\u0302 would require very special boundary conditions on\nholomorphic functions \u03c8(p) at Re p = 0, a mathematically by itself interesting but still unsolved problem\n[5].\nHowever, the vertex operator (31) can be shown to become self-adjoint as a whole 4 on account of its\nsymmetry under transformations given by the S-matrix\n\n\u015c = P\u0302S(p).\n\n(32)\n\nHere S(p) is the multiplicative reflection amplitude (16) with p = ~\u03b3k and P\u0302 the parity operator P\u0302\u03c8(p) =\n\u03c8(\u2212p). It is easy to see that (32) replaces the in-coming first term of (31) by the out-going second one,\nand vice versa, so that the particle vertex operator remains invariant. That means V\u0302out (\u03c4 ) = \u015c V\u0302 (\u03c4 )\u015c \u22121\nis identical to (31). This also holds in general as one can see from (21) and (25). The S-matrix is just the\nquantum version of the symmetry transformation (9). \u015c also maps the Hilbert space of the in-fields L2 (R+ )\nonto L2 (R\u2212 ) for the out-fields, which for the wave functions \u03c8(p) \u2208 L2 (R+ ), \u03c8\u0303(p) \u2208 L2 (R\u2212 ) is given by\n\u03c8\u0303(\u2212p) = S(p)\u03c8(p). The last relation is defined by (29) using (14) and \u03a8\u2217\u2212k (x) = d\u2217\u2212k K\u2212ik = Sk \u03a8\u2217k (x).\nDue to these properties one can extend the definition of the matrix element of the vertex operator from\nL2 (R+ ) to L2 (R)\nZ\nZ \u221e\n1 \u221e\n\u2217\ndp \u03a8\u2217 (p)V\u0302 (\u03c4 )\u03a8(p).\n(33)\ndp \u03c8+ (p)V\u0302 (\u03c4 )\u03c8+ (p) =\n2 \u2212\u221e\n0\nHere \u03a8(p) = \u03c8(p) for p > 0, \u03a8(p) = \u03c8\u0303(p) = S(\u2212P )\u03c8(\u2212p) for p < 0, and \u03a8(p) \u2208 L2 (R) satisfies\n\u015c\u03a8(p) = \u03a8(p). Self-adjointness of the operator (31) obviously holds on L2 (R) for holomorphic wave\nfunctions \u03a8(p). As a consequence, self-adjointness of V\u0302 (\u03c4 ) on L2 (R+ ) requires for \u03c8(p) a holomorphic\nextension to the negative half-line so that \u03c8(\u2212p) = \u03c8\u0303(\u2212p) = S(p)\u03c8(p). Such functions are given by\n\u03c8(p) = d \u2217 (p)f (p), where d(p) is defined by (14) with p = ~\u03b3k, f (p) is an even holomorphic function\nf (\u2212p) = f (p), and (33) is well defined at p = 0 since \u03c8(0) = 0 on account of d(0) = 0.\n\n4\n\nReduced Liouville field theory\n\nThe Liouville vertex operator which corresponds to (31) results as an oscillator vacuum matrix element\n[2, 5]\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03b3 p\u0302\n\u03b3 p\u0302\n\u03b3p\n\u03b3p\np\u0302\n\u03b3 p\u0302\n\u0393 i 2\u03c0\ne 4\u03c0 \u03c4 \u0393 \u2212i 2\u03c0\ne 4\u03c0 \u03c4\n\u2212\u03b3\n\u03c4\n\u2212\u03b3\nq\u0302\n\u2212\n\u03c4\n2\n\u03b3\nq\u0302\n\u0001\n\u0001\nV\u0302(\u03c4 ) = e 4\u03c0 e\ne 4\u03c0 + \u03c9\u03b1\ne\n.\n(34)\n\u03b3p\n\u03b3p\np\u0302\np\u0302\n\u0393 i 2\u03c0\n\u0393 \u2212i 2\u03c0\nwhere\n\n\u03c9\u03b1 =\n\n2\u03c0m\u03b1 \u0393(1 + 2\u03b1)\n\u03b3\n\nand\n\nm2\u03b1 =\n\nsin 2\u03c0\u03b1 2\nm .\n2\u03c0\u03b1\n\n(35)\n\nBoth, the parameter \u03c9\u03b1 and the \u0393-functions describe classical-valued quantum deformations which are\ndue to oscillator as well as zero mode contributions.\nAsking the question whether the operator (34) is symmetric under a S-matrix transformation \u015cL =\nP\u0302SL (p) which exchanges the in-coming with the deformed out-going zero mode part, we found as an\nanswer the deformed reflection amplitude\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u00132ik\n\u0012\n\u03b3p\n\u03b3p\n\u0393 i 4\u03c0\u03b1\n\u0393 i 2\u03c0\n4\u03c0m\u03b12\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(36)\nSL (p) = \u2212\n\u03b3p\n\u03b3p .\n\u0393(1 + 2\u03b1) sin 2\u03c0\u03b1\n\u0393 \u2212i 4\u03c0\u03b1\n\u0393 \u2212i 2\u03c0\n4 We thank an anonymous referee of [5] for a simple realisation of this idea.
