Introdu tion\n\nDoping of planar antiferromagneti insulators breaks the antiferromagneti order and gives rise to\nthe state that pre edes the high-temperature super ondu ting phase. After one of ten ele trons is\nmoved, roughly speaking, to the reservoir of dopants, the phase with short-wave length orrelations\nof the ele tron degrees of freedom arises. This strongly orrelated ele tron system has several key\nproperties. Among them are strikingly small values of hole doping in the underdoped region of the\nphase diagram, where there are both unusual so- alled pseudogap and super ondu ting phases.\nThe \"normal\" state is hara terized by a nonuniform distribution of strongly orrelated spin\n[1, 2\u2104 and harge [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\u2104 degrees of freedom, as well as by an ele tron-hole asymmetry [9, 10\u2104.\nA omparison of experimental data obtained from diffent types of super ondu tors shows that the\nuniversal two- omponent dynami s takes pla e in all uprates investigated so far. The universal\nmulti- omponent response is lear indi ation of the presen e of the phase stratifi ation [11\u2104 in\nuprates. Study of ooperative behavior in inhomogeneous systems is re ognized nowadays as one\nof the most hallenging problems of the ondensed matter physi s [12, 13\u2104 and non-Abelian field\ntheory [14, 15, 16, 17\u2104. The aim of this paper is to find bounds on the free energy of inhomogeneous\nurrent states of doped antiferromagneti insulators at a moderate level of doping.\nMany re ent experiments provided signifi ant support to the idea [18\u2104 that pseudogap phase is\nthe initial state for the super ondu ting phase due to pre ursor pairing and that it has basi ally\nthe same origin as super ondu tivity. In this paper we fo us on the universal des ription of both\nphases, onsidering them on equal footing. Starting from pseudogap phase, we use an equvalent\n\u2217 e-mail: alprot\bappl.s i-nnov.ru\n\n1\n\n\fform of the spinor Ginzburg-Landau fun tional to study a free energy gain. To hara terize the\nproperties of the spatial onfigurations of strongly orrelated spin and harge degrees of freedom\nin the partial oherent phase we introdu e a toroid moment [19, 20, 21\u2104. We show how to embed\nonsidered planar phenomena into three-dimensional spa e. Using quasi-one-dimensional hara ter\nof spatial distributions of hole density and the per olation pi ture of the harge onfigurations, we\nargue also why is the optimal doping in high-temperature super ondu tors so small.\n2. Model\n\nTo des ribe spatial distributions of the ele tron degrees of freedom, we shall use the following\n(3 + 0)D extended version [22\u2104 of the O(3) nonlinear \u03c3 model:\nF = Fn + F\u03c1 + Fc =\n(1)\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0014\u0012\nZ\n1\nd\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n.\n\u03c12 (\u2202k n) + Hik\n+ (\u2202k \u03c1) \u2212 b\u03c12 + \u03c14 +\n\u03c12 c2 + Fik\n\u2212 2Fik Hik\nd3 x\n4\n2\n16\n\nIn this equation, the field of the unit ve tor n(x, y, z) des ribes spin distributions, while the momentum field c = J/\u03c12 = a \u2212 A, where J is the total urrent, ontains paramagneti (a) and\ndiamagneti (\u2212A) parts. In Eq. (1) Fik = \u2202i ck \u2212 \u2202k ci and Hik = n * [\u2202i n \u00d7 \u2202k n] = \u2202i ak \u2212 \u2202k ai . For\nsimpli ity, the Higgs potential in Eq. (1) is expressed only via two onstants b and d. The den1 2 2\n2\nsity of the urrent energy 16\nand the diamagneti oupling \u22122Fik Hik\n\u03c1 c , the surfa e energy Fik\nof the fields a and c determine ontributions to the urrent part, Fc , of the free energy. The\ndimensionless units of all the variables are given in Ref. [23\u2104.\nThe first term in Eq. (1) is the energy of a Heisenberg antiferromagnet written in the long-wave\n2\nof the internal magneti field Hi = 1/2 \u03b5iks Hks in the long-wave\nlength limit. The self-energy Hik\nlength limit [24\u2104 in ludes the mean value < 0|S1 [S2 \u00d7 S3 ]|0 > of the spin non ollinearity degree\non the three sites of a plaquette of the square latti e whi h appears after the ele tron is moved\nfrom the fourth site to the reservoir of the dopants. These hiral three-spin orrelations of spin\ndegrees of freedom are the main building blo k for the formation of more ompli ated spin and\nharge stru tures onsidered below. The stru tures are en oded in Eq. (1) by the term (Hik \u2212Fik )2\nwhi h des ribes also mutual frustration of the urrents a and c.\nFor better understanding of the role of ea h term in free energy (1), it is useful to ompare Eq.\n(1) with the Hamiltonian of the t \u2212 J model\n\u0014\n\u0015\nX\nX\n\u0001\n1\nJij Si Sj \u2212 ni nj \u2212\nH=\ntij a+\ni\u03c3 aj\u03c3 + H.c.\n4\n<ij>\n<ij>,\u03c3\n+\nin the inhomogeneous ase. Here ai\u03c3 = ci\u03c3 (1 \u2212 ni,\u2212\u03c3 ), ni,\u03c3 = c+\ni\u03c3 ci\u03c3 , Si = ci\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 ci\u03b2 /2. This model\nis a standart one when studying different phase states in doped antiferromagneti insulators. At\ngradient expansion, the first and the se ond terms in this equation provide the first and the third\nterms in Eq. (1) respe tively. The last kineti term in the t \u2212 J model ensures the existen e of the\nterm (1/16)\u03c12 c2 in Eq. (1). The self-energy B2 /8\u03c0 \u223c curl2 A \u223c (Hik \u2212 Fik )2 of the gauge field A\nin Eq. (1) an be also obtained [25, 26\u2104 in the framework of the t \u2212 J model.\nThe ex hange integral modulation, the s alar field \u03c1(x, y, z) in (1) des ribes the spin stiffness\n\u03c12 and depends by the doping level. Indeed, the spin stiffness \u03c12 relates to the density \u03c12h of\npositively harged va ant sites, so- alled \"holes\", by the onstraint \u03c12 + \u03c12h = 1 [27\u2104. If \u03c12 . 1 ,\n2\nthe hole density \u03c12h , like the term Hik\n, is lo alized at the boundaries of the regions of the nonzero\nspin density, i.e. it exists on the omplement spa e with respe t to the spa e of the spin density\ndefinition. Based on this remark and on the latti e patterns of the distributions of the spin degrees\n\n2\n\n\fof freedom, a low-dimensional analog of the holographi prin iple, whi h leads to the on lusion\nthat the distribution of the states with broken antiferromagneti order has the boundary hara ter,\nwas proposed in Ref. [28\u2104.\n3. Knots and links of order parameters\n\nThe properties of different phases in model (1) depend on the distributions of ompeting order\nparameters n, \u03c1 and c in the ground states. At c = 0 and \u03c1 = const Rthe onfigurations of the\n1\nd3 x \u03b5ikl ai \u2202k al . At the\nfield n(x, y, z) are lassified by the Hopf invariant [29, 30, 31\u2104 Q = 16\u03c0\n2\nM\n\nompa tifi ation of R3 \u2192 M = S 3 and n \u2208 S 2 , an integer Q \u2208 Z \u21d0 \u03c03 (s2 ) indi ates the degree of\nlinking or knotting of a filament maniford olle tion in the three-dimensional spa e M, where the\nfield of the unit ve tor n(x, y, z) is onstant: n(x, y, z) = n. For two linked loops Q = 1, for the\ntrefoil knot Q = 6 and et . In this ase the lo al minima of the free energy F are determined [32\u2104\nby the inequality:\nF \u2265 32\u03c0 2 |Q|\n\n3/4\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nThe quasi-one-dimensional hara ter of the distribution of the n-field in Eq. (1) at \u03c1 = const,\nc = 0, if \u03c1 6= const, c = 0 affe ts also the hole density \u03c12h = 1 \u2212 \u03c12 [28\u2104. The onfigurations of field\n\u03c1h in the form of stripes and loops are most advantageous in this ase.\nWhen the field of the momentum c 6= 0 is unquen hed and \u03c1 = const, free energy bound\nde reases [33\u2104:\nF \u2265 32\u03c0 2 |Q|\n\n3/4\n\n\u0012\n\u00132\n|L|\n,\n1\u2212\n|Q|\n\n(3)\n\nR 3\n1\nwhere the mutual linking number of the fields a and c equals L = 16\u03c0\nd x \u03b5ksl ck \u2202s al , is\n2\ndetermined by the invariant L 6\u2208 Z. The universal gain of the free energy in Eq. (3) des ribes the\nondensation energy [34\u2104 in the onsidered model of strongly developed spin distributions.\nThe redu tion of the free energy bound o urs due to the diamagneti oupling of the urrents in\nEq. (1). The ontribution of this last term is so signifi ant that it onsumes ompletely the energy\nFc and a part of the energy Fn . This phase with large pair momentum differs from the FFLO\nstate [35, 36\u2104 by the unquen hed paramagneti part of the total urrent. The se ond disti tion\norresponds in a general ase to inhomogenious distribution of the total momentum of pairs existing\nin the in oherent form [18\u2104 above the super ondu ting Tc .\nThe existen e of quasi-one-dimensional onfigurations with open ends and in the form of loops\nin the framework of the present model, when the free energy density has the form f = (\u2202k \u03c1)2 +\nVef f (\u03c1) + (Fik \u2212 Hik )2 , with Vef f = \u2212bef f \u03c12 + (d/2) \u03c14 and bef f = b \u2212 (1/16)c2 \u2212 (1/4) (\u2202k n)2 ,\norresponds to different phase states [37, 38\u2104. In the phase, where the gauge symmetry remains\nunbroken, bef f < 0 and \u03c1min = 0.\nIt follows from the equation for the energy Vef f that inhomogeneous distributions of the fields\nexist only in the ase bef f > 0. With the hange of doping, approa hing the phase with bef f > 0,\nwhere the gauge symmetry is broken due to Higgs effe t, the fra tion of quasi-one-dimensional onfigurations with losed ends in reases. In the phase bef f > 0, there exist [38\u2104 quasi-onedimensional\nonfigurations of length l, satisfying the relation l \u03c1min = 2\u03c0n. In the ground state c = 0, and\nthe value \u03c1min for the amplitude of the Higgs field in the ground state is determined by the ontribution (1/4)(\u2202k n)2 of the hara teristi onfigurations of field n. In this ase, distributions in\nthe form of a ring are typi al onfigurations of field \u03c1 [28\u2104. For greater values (l \u03c1min > 2\u03c0) of the\nommensurability parameter l \u03c1min in the ground state, there exist losed quasi-one-dimensional\n\n3\n\n\fdistributions of field \u03c1. For suffi iently short (0 < l \u03c1min < 2\u03c0) onfigurations of the field \u03c1 in\nthe ground state, quasi-one-dimensional field distributions with open ends may be found. Summarizing, we see that in magneto-inhomogeneous phases, we en ounter an internal hierar hi al\nmulti-s ale stru ture, determined by the density field, whi h be omes ru ial for the des ription\nof these phases.\nWe see also that the state with a finite value of the momentum field c is hara terized by\nthe ompeting inhomogeneous order parameters n and c with non-lo al orrelations 1 between\nthem due to the entanglement of their one-dimensional distributions. Note that this on lusion\nis in agreement with one of the main statements of Refs. [39, 40\u2104 that inhomogeneous urrent\nstates annot be des ribed with the aid of Ginzburg-Landau fun tional with the one- omponent\norder parameter. In our ase the existen e of inhomogeneous urrent states is due to the nonlinear oupling of several order parameters n, c and \u03c1 at the level of their equations of motion.\nThe analogous on lusion may be made, starting from a latti e des ription of urrent states in a\nso- alled staggered flux phase [41\u2104, onsidering strong orrelations of harge and spin degrees of\nfreedom in the mean field approa h. Flux phases and DDV states [42, 43, 44\u2104, i.e. the phases with\na modulation of the urrent density, are well-known parti ular examples of the toroid states. In\nthis paper we fo us our attention on non-perturbative analysis, and onsider a general ase when\nall inhomogeneous order parameters are present.\n4. Inhomogeneous\n\nurrent states\n\n.\n\nThe basi property of model (1) is the ompa tness of field n, whi h leads to its one-dimensional\ndistributions in the form of knots [29, 30, 31, 45, 46, 47\u2104, and to the dis rete hara ter of spe trum\n, we first writeidown the energy Fn at\n(2). To analyze the general ase of c 6= 0 and \u03c1 6= const\nR 3 h\n\u221a\n2\n2\n= g1 g2 (r/R + R/r),\n\u03c1 = const and xi \u2192 xi r in the form of Fn = d x g1 (\u2202k n) + g2 Hik\np\nwhere r is the s ale fa tor, R = g2 /g1 and g1 \u223c \u03c12 and g2 = 1 are the oupling onstants.\nThe latter equation shows that the hara teristi knot size at the minimum of the energy Fn is\nproportional to \u03c1\u22121 .\nWith the in rease of doping \u03c12h , i. e. with de rease of \u03c12 , the radius R \u223c 1/\u03c1 grows up to\nits ertain riti al value Rcr . Beginning from this radius, the onfigurations of field n, forming\nthe knot, are unstable [48\u2104 with respe t to the s ale transformations. This means that knots of a\nsize greater than Rcr ollapse, and form lo alized stru tures near the points of the stereographi\nproje tion R3 \u2192 S 3 . This phenomenon appears to be the key one, when we ompare different\nontributions to the free energy (1) in an inhomogeneous urrent state at small enough values of\n\u03c12 .\nWe see that at suffi iently small density \u03c12 or (whi h is the same) at suffi iently high level of\ndoping \u03c12h , beginning from the finite values of density \u03c12 , in order to des ribe strongly orrelated\nharge and spin degrees of freedom, one may introdu e a small parameter, determined by the\nrelation R0 /R, where R0 is the orrelation length of the n- and c-field distributions. The radius\nR0 has the geometri meaning of the filament thi kness, for whi h the onfigurations of these fields\nare determined. A typi al value of R0 is of the order of 10 \u0006\nA, i. e. it equals three-four latti e\nonstants. Sin e Ginzburg parameter in this ase is mu h less than unity, we may use the mean\n1 In (2 + 1)D dimensional form of the dynami al des ription, the non-lo al intera tion between ele trons may\nbe des ribed using Chern-Simons statisti al gauge fields\n\nai\u03b1 , whi h indu e strong orrelations of the phases of\nkij in the Chern-Simons a tion S =\n\nfermion quantum states at large distan es.

A hara teristi s ale R has the meaning [49\u2104 of the effe tive radius of urrent\norrelations.\nLet us assume that R0 < R < Rcr and ompare the de rease of the free energy (1) due to the\ndiamagneti term \u22122Fik Hik with its in rease due to the term (\u2202k \u03c1)2 . If the ontribution of the\ndiamagneti term \u22122Fik Hik is of the order of c0 /R03 , where c0 is the amplitude of the momentum\nfield c, the estimate of the maximum ontribution of the term (\u2202k \u03c1)2 yields 1/(RR0 )2 . The gain\nobviously should be also greater than the ontributions of other terms in the last bra ket in Eq.\n2\n2\n\u223c c20 /R02 as well as of the urrent energy \u03c12 c2 \u223c Fik\n(R0 /R)2 .\n(1), i. e. of the surfa e term Fik\n2\nCombining these inequalities, we see that at \u03b1 = (R0 /R) << 1 and at a finite value of the\nmomentum determined by the inequality\n\u03b1/R0 < c0 < 1/R0\n\n(4)\n\neven in a state with the inhomogeneous distribution of the density \u03c12 the free energy may be smaller\ndue to diamagnetism than at c = 0 in Eq. (1). The parameter \u03b1 has the meaning of the degree of\nfilament pa king in the three-dimensional spa e. It is the sear hed small parameter in our problem\nof strongly orrelated spin and harge degrees of freedom when all oupling onstants are of the\norder of unity. In the ase n = const, it is proportional to \u03ba\u22122 where \u03ba is the Ginzburg-Landau\nparameter.\nTo find the ondition for a state with momentum from the range (4) when the energy is less,\nthan at c = 0 (in spite of inhomogeneity), let us ompare the gain of the total free energy with\nthe ontribution from the term (\u2202k \u03c1)2 . The loss of the energy is of the order of Rz /R2 . Here Rz\nis the \"verti al\" knot size. Therefore, the diamagneti ontribution is the main one for suffi iently\nflat knots [50\u2104, existing at R0 < Rz < R < Rcr . This means that the energy of onfigurations in\nthe se tor with the topologi al invariant L 6= 0 even in the inhomogeneous state may be less than\nat c = 0. This on lusion is one of the main results of the paper. The ondensation energy [34\u2104,\nwhi h depends on the linking degrees L and Q, de reases in omparison with the ase of \u03c1 = const\n\u0001\n[33\u2104. The minimal value of the free energy gain \u2212\u2206F an be estimated as \u2212\u2206F \u2243 64\u03c0 2 /Q1/4 \u03b1.\n4. Toroid state\n\nLet us assume that the level of doping is small enough, i.e. \u03c1h \u226a 1. Then the spin density \u03c12 is\nlarge and a knot size R is so small that \u03b1 . 1. The de rease of the degree \u03b1 of filament pa king in\nthe knot with the in rease of \u03c1h is a ompanied by the transition to a state, in whi h among planar\nfield proje tions the field onfigurations \u03c1(x, y) in the form of losed one-dimensional distributions\nare most preferable [28\u2104.\nThe fa t, whether the boundary harge states at the boundaries of these isulating regions will\nform an infinite per olative luster, depends on the hole density \u03c12h . Let the level of doping be\ninsuffi ient for the appearan e of an extended onne table luster. In a ordan e with Ginzburg's\nproposal, we will all this phase state with the spontaneous diamagnetism a toroid state [40\u2104. The\nphase state, in whi h urrent order is hara terized by a polar ve tor T , that hanges sign under\ntime reversal, an be represented by the ordering of toroid moments. It is hara terized by a toroid\nmoment T, whi h is defined in the following way [19, 20\u2104\na = curl curl T .\n\n(5)\n\nUsing the equality (4) and the identity [51\u2104\n(curl a)i =\n\n1\n\u03b5ikl n [\u2202k n \u00d7 \u2202l n]\n2\n\n5\n\n(6)\n\n\fone an express the toroid moment via the hiral degree of non ollinearity n * [\u2202k n \u00d7 \u2202l n] in the\nform:\n#\n\"\nZ\nZ\n\u2032\n1\n3 \u2032\u2032 n * [\u2202k n \u00d7 \u2202i n]\n3 \u2032 (r \u2212 r )k\nTi (r) =\n(7)\nd r\n.\nd r\n3\n16\u03c0 2\n|r \u2032 \u2212 r \u2032\u2032 |\n|r \u2212 r \u2032 |\n\nWe see that toroid moment T is given by the non-lo al Biot-Savart law as well as by the fa tor\nwhi h is determined by the Coulomb Green fun tion. The ve tor T hara terizes the distribution\nof the poloidal omponent of the urrent on the torus [19, 20\u2104. The magneti field of this urrent\nis onfined to the interior of the torus. For the degree of non ollinearity (lo alized at a point)\nn * [\u2202k n \u00d7 \u2202i n] = \u03b5ki \u03b4(r) of the spin distributions, the toroid moment has the form\nZ\n(r \u2212 r \u2032 )k\n\u03b5ki\n\u03b5ki xk\nd3 r\u2032\nTi (r) =\n(8)\n3 = 8\u03c0 r .\n2\n\u2032\n\u2032\n16\u03c0\nr |r \u2212 r |\nIf the hiral density n * [\u2202k n \u00d7 \u2202i n] = (\u03b5ki /(2\u03c0R)) \u03b4(z)\u03b4(r \u2212 R) of spin distributions is lo alized\nin the plane z = 0 on a ring of radius R, the toroidal moment equals Ti (r, z = 0) = \u03b5ki (xi /r)t(r)\nwith the fun tion t(r) having its maximum at r = R and t(r) \u223c r\u22122 at r \u226b R.\nIn the toroid state the diamagneti sus eptibility \u03c7\u2032 is determined [40\u2104 by the radius R of\nurrent orrelations in su h a way that \u03c7\u2032 = \u03c7L /\u03b1. Here \u03c7L = \u2212e2 kF /(12\u03c0 2 mc2 ) is the Landau\ndiamagneti sus eptibility for non-intera ting ele trons. For porous knots with \u03b1 \u226a 1, it an be\nrather signifi ant. Anomalously great diamagneti sus eptibility is aused by a great radius R of\nurrent orrelations. It should also be noted that the ondition [49\u2104 \u03c7L \u223c \u2212e2 nr2 /(mc2 ) > \u22121/4\u03c0\nequivalent to the inequality r < rD = c/\u03c9p on e again attra t our attention to the boundary\nhara ter of the onsidered phenomena. Here n is the mean ele tron density, rD is the Debye\nradius, and \u03c9p = (4\u03c0ne2 /m)1/2 is the plasma frequen y. We pay attention to the fa t that in this\nphase the total magneti moment of lusters equals zero and the toroid state is d-symmetri .\nThe realization of the toroid state is a hieved in systems belonging to 31 lasses of magneti\nsymmetry where the ve tor T an exist [49\u2104. The onditions [49\u2104 for the realization of a toroid\nstate are easier to satisfy (i) in the neihborhood of inhomogeneities and (ii) in systems with strong\nele tron orrelations. (iii) The toroidal state formed against the ba kground of the antiferromagneti state is the most likely situation as well as (iv) onditions of the presen e of harged and\nmagneti impurities, i.e. holes and dynami al non- ollinear spin distributions in our ase. (v)\nStrong spin-orbit intera tion also gives rise to effe ts asso iated with toroidal ordering. All these\nonditions are met in the system at hand.\n5. Planar phenomena in\n\n3D\n\nspa e\n\nUnder the onditions when all the oupling onstants in (1) are of the order of unity 2 the main obje t of the study appears to be the geometri properties and the topology of knotted one-dimensional\nmanifolds of the order parameter domain, whi h give the main ontribution to the free energy. One\nof the results of this approa h is the appearan e of the parameter \u03b1 = (R0 /R)2 < 1, hara terizing\nthe degree of filament pa king in the knot. The existen e of the minimal value of the field \u03c12 ,\nplaying the role of the running oupling onstant in Eq. (1), i. e. the existen e of the minimal\nvalue \u03b1min = (R0 /Rcr )2 , is similar to the emergen e of the solution for the super ondu ting gap in\na two- omponent model [52\u2104, beginning (unlike BCS model) with the finite value of the oupling\nonstant.\nLet us des ribe a method of embedding planar phenomena into the 3D spa e. We hoose a\ntuning parameter \u03c12 \u223c 1/R2 that \u03b1min < \u03b1 << 1. Let us onsider the proje tion of omplementary\n2 This is one of the reasons, why the problem dis ussed annot be urrently solved, even numeri ally.\n\n6\n\n\fFigure 1: ( olour online). Complementary surfa es for a flat (l.h.s.) and extended along z -axis\n(r.h.s.) trefoil knots.\nspa es for knots whi h are pulled over the knots (so- alled Seifert surfa es) to the plane (x, y). For\ndefiniteness, we onsider the simplest (among torus knots) trefoil knot with Q = 6. In the ase of\nthe flat (Rz < R) knot, the omplementary spa e is a triple twisted band. In the ase of the knot\nstret hed along the axis z (at R < Rz < Rcr ) the Seifert surfa e is a torus with a hole (see Fig. 1)\n3.\nThe harge degrees of freedom are distributed (as it has been already mentioned) at the boundary of the omplementary spa e for knots. Therefore, the boundary line presents a ir le, whi h\nis the proje tion of these one-dimensional boundary onfigurations for a suffi iently flat knot. For\nthe stret hed knot (at R < Rz < Rcr ), the line is a stripe with the length of the order of R0 , equal\nto the s ale of the hole mentioned above. Summarizing, we an see that the free energy gain in an\ninhomogeneous urrent state is a hieved, due to diamagnetism, for the distributions of the harge\ndensity on the plane in the form of loops.\nThe study of su h onfigurations of the harge density is based on measuring the density of\nstates (DOS) by means of s anning tunneling mi ros ope (STM). In su h experiments [53\u2104 the\nformation of the DOS filaments in the form of rings have been dis overed re ently in the entangled labyrinthine pattern of quasi-one-dimensional distributions of the harge density in planar\nompounds Ca2\u2212x N ax CuO2 Cl2 at the moderate doping x.\n6. Optimal doping\n\nWhether the phase both with \u03b1cr < \u03b1 << 1 and the finite pair momentum [35, 36\u2104 c0 remains super ondu ting or appears to be an intermediate state with spontaneous diamagnetism [49\u2104 depends\nperhaps on the onne tness of the total urrent luster (see e.g. [54\u2104), formed by the proje tions\nof Seifert surfa es on the plane.\nIt is natural to suppose that the o urren e of pre-formed ele tron pairs in the underdoped state\n[18\u2104 and a phase oheren e in the super ondu ting phase are indepent phenomena. Starting with\nthe pi ture of pre-formed pairs, we dis uss in this se tion some features of the phase oheren e\ndue to per olation [55\u2104 using harge density stru tures mentioned above. With the in rease of\n3 The braided filaments of the trefoil, stret hed along the time axis, one an onsider in (2 + 1)D dynami al ase\nas the result of the a tion of\n\nb31 on the quantum states of the braid group operator b1 .\n\n7\n\n\fthe hole density \u03c12h , the size of ring-shaped urrent distributions in reases to su h an extent that\nthe onditions arise for the appearan e of two-dimensional onne table urrent lusters and the\ntransition to the state with c 6= 0 with the gain of free energy. We shall find the level pbest , for\nwhi h the temperature of the transition to the super ondu ting state is maximal.\nIf we did not take into a ount the distributions of the harge degrees of freedom at the\nboundaries of the filament onfigurations of the field n in the knot only, we would deal with 2D\nper olation problem with a well-known [54\u2104 answer pcr = 0.5 for the bond per olation threshold\nvalue. A onsiderable distin tion between the experimentally observed value pbest, exp = 0.16 from\nthis value is a onvenient test for he king the a epted point of view.\nTo solve the problem in question we shall use the re ent experimental results [53\u2104. With\nthe aid of the s anning tunnel mi ros ope it was found in [53\u2104 that among quasi-one-dimensional\nonfigurations with an in reased density of harge states in the underdoped region, the fra tion\nof filament field distributions in the form of ring-shaped stru tures in reases with the in rease\nof the doping level. Using the orresponding trial fun tions of paper [28\u2104 it was shown that in\nthe framework of model (1), su h onfigurations of the field \u03c1h are preferable when the degree\nof doping in reases. The interpretation of the results of measuring the distributions of the spin\ndegrees of freedom in underdoped states on the basis of neutron s attering [1, 2\u2104 is also based on the\nassumption of quasi-one-dimensional nanos ale distributions in the planes of ondu ting lusters\nin the form of thin rings.\nLet us suppose that the boundary urrents are distributed along the boundaries of ring insulator\nregions with su h a relationship that the ring thi kness differs from its diameter, as it follows from\nthe experiment [53\u2104, by one order (\u03b11/2 \u2243 0.1). The geometri al onfinement allows us to negle t\nthe ontribution of internal (with respe t to ring-shaped) distributions of degrees of freedom. Thus\nfor the threshold of the flow along the onne table luster, formed by ideal distributions in the\nform of rings, we get a onsiderabl smaller value: pbest = 0.5 \u2212 0.314 = 0.186 in omparison with\nthe standart one pcr = 0.5. For a urrent ell in the form of a hexahedron, pbest = 0.179. This\nexample shows that omparatively slight deviations of the form of the elementary urrent ell\nfrom the ideal ring-shaped form may lead to a shift in the value pbest towards the experimentally\nobserved value pbest, exp = 0.16. If a square, onstru ted by the distributions in the form of stripes,\nwere used instead of a ring, we would have pbest = 0.5 \u2212 0.4 = 0.1.\nStudy of general properties of high-temperature super ondu ting states, belonging to different\nlasses of ompaunds, shows that the dependen e of the riti al temperature on the hole on entration, for example in Y1\u2212x Cax Ba2 Cu3 O6 and La2\u2212x Srx Cu)4 , is well represented [56, 57\u2104 by\nthe empiri urve Tc /Tc,max = 1 \u2212 82.6(p \u2212 0.16)2 at p = x/2. This paraboli dependen e Tc (p),\nhas zeros at pmin \u2248 0.05, pmax \u2248 0.27 and a maximum at pbest = 0.16. Optimally doped ompounds based on thallium, for example T l0.5 P b0.5 Sr2 Ca0.8 Y0.2 Cu2 O7 , have pbest = 0.15. Some\nother lasses of high-temperature super ondu tors point to similar values. We note also that the\nunderdoped pseudo-gap phase with strong developed spin and harge distributions appears in the\nabove mentioned lasses of the ompounds at a well-defined [58\u2104 hole on entration p \u2248 0.19.\n\n6. Con lusion\n\nUnder onditions of moderate doping \u03c12h , the value of \u03c12 may be su h that the knot size R \u223c 1/\u03c1 \u223c\nRz appears to be omparable with the orrelation length R0 . Sin e all values in Eq. (1) are of\nthe same order, these greater values of \u03c12 orrespond to smaller values of the momentum c and\ndue to Eq. (3) the energy gain is less. In the optimum ase of great values c the self-dual state\nFn \u2248 Fc , whi h is hara terized by the dense pa king of knot filaments (\u03b1 . 1), a\u2212 c = A = 0 and\n8\n\n\f\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nQ L\n1 1\n\u21d2\nQ\n, where a1i \u2261 ai ,\n\u2032\nL\nQ\n1\n1\nM\na2i \u2261 ci , may be onsidered as initial ompressible state for the transition to the in ompressible\nphase \u03b1 << 1 with the in rease of the doping degree. The ompressibility of the state at \u03b1 . 1\no urs due to the existen e of non-zero Poisson bra ket {x0 , y0 } for the oordinates x0 , y0 of the\nvortex filament enter. The un ertainty of the lo ation of the ore enter at the dense filament\npa king gives rise to the nullifi ation of the linking degree Q due to the effe t of the filament\nre onne tion. This leads to the transition to the ground state with Q = 0.\nThe omparison of the results of the present paper with the on lusions of [60\u2104, following from\nthe appli ation of the onformal field theory methods to find the exa t solution of the problem\nof super ondu ting states in luster systems, requires thorough analysis of the details of the nullifi ation (k + 2 = 0) me hanism of the linking oeffi ients k + 2 \u223c Q in SU (2) Chern-Simons\na tion.\nIn on lusion, we have ompared the value of the free energy gain due to diamagnetism in the\ninhomogeneous urrent state with the value of the energy loss due to inhomogeneity and found the\nonditions, under whi h the energy of inhomogeneous states with a urrent appears to be less than\nin the absen e of the urrent. Studying the threshold level of doping with the use of the per olation\napproa h of des ribing urrent onfigurations, existing in doped antiferromagneti insulators, we\nhave found, that in the toroid state the optimal value of the hole on entration is lose to the\nexperimentally observed value. The toroid moment in this d-symmetri state is expressed via the\nhiral degree of non ollinearity of the distribution of the spin degrees of freedom.\n\nby the matrix [59\u2104 K\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\n1\n16\u03c0 2\n\nR\n\n\u03b2\nd3 x \u03b5ikl a\u03b1\ni \u2202k al =\n\n\u0012\n\nA knowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to L.
