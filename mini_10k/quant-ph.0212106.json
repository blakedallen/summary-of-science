Similarities and differences between decoherence dynamics examined quantum mechanically and classically are exposed via a\nsecond-order perturbative treatment and via a strong decoherence theory, showing a strong dependence on the nature of the system-environment coupling. For example, for the traditionally assumed\nlinear coupling, the classical and quantum results are shown to be in exact agreement.\n\narXiv:quant-ph/0212106v1 18 Dec 2002\n\nPACS numbers: 03.65.Yz\n\nDecoherence is the loss of quantum coherence due to system-bath coupling. There has been considerable theoretical\nand experimental work demonstrating that quantum-classical correspondence (QCC) can be induced by decoherence\n[1, 2, 3]. By contrast, little work has been done on examining the correspondence between classical and quantum\ndescriptions of the time evolution of decoherence itself, i.e. decoherence dynamics. In this Letter we show that (a) one\ncan introduce a direct classical analog of quantum decoherence, and (b) by examining the dynamics of decoherence\nclassically one gains new insights into both the dynamics of decoherence described quantum mechanically and into the\nconditions for QCC of the dynamics of decoherence. For example, we show that the extent of QCC depends strongly\non the nature of the system-bath coupling and far less upon h\u0304 than expected, that results assumed to be quantum\nmechanical can be obtained classically and that nonlinear system-bath coupling can cause nonclassical decoherence\ndynamics even for macroscopic systems.\nThe formal Liouville-based theory of QCC in an isolated system [4] makes clear that there is a strict analogy\nbetween quantum and classical dynamics in phase space. As in the quantum case, the classical Liouville dynamics of\na closed system is unitary and we expect the reduced classical Liouville dynamics of a system coupled to a bath to\nbe nonunitary. We therefore suspect that, due to bath's coarse-graining effects, the reduced dynamics of the system\npropagated classically will show decoherence dynamics that is, qualitatively, parallel to that seen in quantum dynamics\ninsofar as the loss of phase information, entropy production, etc.\nHere we quantitatively compare the dynamics of decoherence that is induced quantum mechanically to that induced\nclassically. This is done by analytically examining the dynamics of an initial quantum state, in a system coupled to a\nbath, that is propagated either quantum mechanically or classically. The observed (rather remarkable) similarities and\ndifferences between the classical and quantum decoherence dynamics should be of considerable interest to a variety of\nmodern fields such as quantum information processing [5] and quantum control of atomic and molecular processes [6].\nFurther, this analysis offers new insights into both decoherence and QCC, is relevant to semiclassical descriptions of\ndecoherence dynamics [7], and has motivated purely classical descriptions of dynamics-induced intrinsic decoherence,\nwith preliminary computations [8] that support the analytic results presented here.\nWe begin by introducing classical analogs of some representation-independent and representation-dependent measures of decoherence. A second-order perturbative treatment is then used to examine QCC in early-time decoherence\ndynamics. Subsequently, we introduce a classical theory of strong decoherence that allows us to go beyond perturbation theory; the results are then compared with corresponding quantum theory.\nConsider a system with a time-independent Hamiltonian H s = P 2 /(2m) + V (Q), where (Q, P ) are conjugate\nposition and momentum variables, coupled to N independent harmonic bath modes described by the Hamiltonians\nHjb = p2j /(2mj ) + mj \u03c9j2 qj2 /2, where {pj , qj } (j = 1, 2, * * * , N ) are bath-mode phase space variables. The systemPN\nbath coupling potential is assumed to be V sb =\nj=1 Cj f (Q)qj so that the total Hamiltonian is given by H =\nP\nN\ns\nb\nH + j=1 [Hj + Cj f (Q)qj ]. The phase space distribution function evolved classically and the quantum Wigner\nfunction for the entire phase space are represented by \u03c1c [Q, P, {qj , pj }, t] and \u03c1W [Q, P, {qj , pj }, t], respectively. Their\ntime evolution is given by \u2202\u03c1c /\u2202t = {H, \u03c1c }P and \u2202\u03c1W /\u2202t = {H, \u03c1W }M , where {*}P denotes classical Poisson bracket\nand {*}M denotes quantum Moyal bracket. Further, we define classical and quantum reduced distribution functions\nR\nR W N\nQN\n\u03c1\u0303c (Q, P, t) \u2261 \u03c1c d\u0393N\n\u03c1 d\u0393b , where d\u0393N\nb and \u03c1\u0303W (Q, P, t) \u2261\nb \u2261\nj=1 dqj dpj . Our interest is in the correspondence\nbetween the classical and quantum decoherence dynamics of initial states that can be either classical (i.e. positive\nWigner density everywhere) or nonclassical [4] (e.g. displaying regions of negative \u03c1W [Q, P, {qj , pj }, t]).\nConsider two measures of decoherence in each of classical and quantum mechanics. One widely-used and\n\u02c62 ) [9], where \u03c1\u0303\n\u02c6 is the reduced density operator\nrepresentation-independent measure is the linear entropy Sq \u2261 1 \u2212 T r(\u03c1\u0303\nof the system. An increase in Sq causes 1/(1 \u2212 Sq ) to increase, corresponding to an increasing number of incoherently\n\n\f2\nR\npopulated orthogonal quantum states. Since Sq = 1 \u2212 2\u03c0h\u0304 \u03c1\u03032W (Q, P, t)d\u0393s , where d\u0393s \u2261 dQdP ,R this entropy has a\nnatural classical analog (denoted Sc ) obtained by replacing \u03c1\u0303W with \u03c1\u0303c . That is, Sc \u2261 1 \u2212 2\u03c0h\u0304 \u03c1\u03032c (Q, P, t)d\u0393s . A\nmore detailed, but representation-dependent description of decoherence is the decay of off-diagonal density matrix\n\u02c6\nelements such as hQ1 |\u03c1\u0303(t)|Q\n2 i. Significantly, we discoverR that the classical analog of these matrix elements can also\n\u02c6\nbe constructed. Specifically, noting that hQ1 |\u03c1\u0303(t)|Q\ndP \u03c1\u0303W (Q, P, t) exp [i\u2206QP/h\u0304], where Q \u2261 (Q1 + Q2 )/2 and\n2i =\n\u02c6\n\u2206Q = Q1 \u2212 Q2 , we define the classical analog (denoted\n\u03c1\u0303\n(Q\nc\n1 , Q2 , t)) of hQ1 |\u03c1\u0303(t)|Q2 i as the Fourier transformed clasR\nsical distribution function, i.e., \u03c1\u0303c (Q1 , Q2 , t) \u2261 dP \u03c1\u0303c (Q, P, t) exp [i\u2206QP/h\u0304]. This approach can be readily extended\nto the momentum representation.\nPerturbative treatments have proved to very useful in understanding decoherence dynamics [10, 11]. Here, to\nexamine classical vs. quantum decoherence dynamics at short times, a regime of great interest in the control of\ndecoherence, we consider a second-order expansion with respect to time variable t for both Sc and Sq , i.e., Sc (t) =\n2\n2\nSc (0) + t/\u03c4c,1 + t2 /\u03c4c,2\n+ * * *, and Sq (t) = Sq (0) + t/\u03c4q,1 + t2 /\u03c4q,2\n+ * * *. Using the definitions of Poisson and Moyal\nbrackets and assuming that the initial distribution function is decorrelated with initial bath statistics, we obtain\n1\n1\n=\n= 0,\n\u03c4c,1\n\u03c4q,1\n1\n2\n\u03c4c,2\n\nCb\n=\nh\u0304\n\nZ\n\n(1)\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\u0014\n\ndf (Q)\ndQ\n\n\u00152\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\n\u00152\n\u0014\n2\n2 \u2206f (Q)\n\u02c6\n,\ndQ1 dQ2 |hQ1 |\u03c1\u0303(0)|Q2 i| \u2206Q\n\u2206Q\n\n(3)\n\ndQ1 dQ2 |\u03c1\u0303c (Q1 , Q2 , 0)| \u2206Q\n\nand\n1\n2\n\u03c4q,2\n\nCb\n=\nh\u0304\n\nZ\n\nPN\nwhere Cb = j=1 Cj2 coth(\u03b2h\u0304\u03c9j /2)/(2mj \u03c9j ), \u2206f (Q) \u2261 f (Q + \u2206Q/2) \u2212 f (Q \u2212 \u2206Q/2), and \u03b2 is the Boltzmann factor.\nNote that the factor h\u0304 appearing in the classical result [Eq. 2)] is just due to the definitions of Sc and \u03c1\u0303c (Q1 , Q2 , 0),\nand that the initial variances of the bath variables qj have been evaluated using quantum statistics to ensure the same\ninitial quantum state for the ensuing classical and quantum dynamics. Note also that the decoherence time scale\nindicated in the easily-derived and simple quantum result of Eq. (3) is consistent with, but is more transparent than,\na previous perturbation result (Eq. (5.6) in Ref. [12]) obtained using a sophisticated influence functional approach.\nEquation (1) shows that zero first-order decoherence rate i.e., 1/\u03c4q,1 =0, has a strict classical analog. More inter2\n2\nestingly, Eqs. (2) and (3) show that, for the same fixed initial distribution function, the ratio of 1/\u03c4q,2\nto 1/\u03c4c,2\n2\n2\nis h\u0304-independent. As seen from Eqs. (2) and (3), (1/\u03c4q,2 \u2212 1/\u03c4c,2 ) arises from the difference between the derivative\ndf /dQ and the finite-difference function \u2206f /\u2206Q, weighted by \u2206Q2 and the initial state. As a result: (1) For any given\n\u02c6\nf (Q), as long as hQ1 |\u03c1\u0303(0)|Q\n2 i decays fast enough with |\u2206Q| such that \u2206f /\u2206Q \u2248 df /dQ, there would be excellent\nQCC in early-time decoherence dynamics. The smaller the h\u0304, the more rigorous is this requirement. (2) If f (Q)\n2\n2\ndepends only linearly or quadratically upon the coupling coordinate Q, then (1/\u03c4q,2\n\u2212 1/\u03c4c,2\n) = 0 for any initial state.\nSignificantly then, in all traditional decoherence models [13] where f (Q) = Q is assumed, there exists perfect QCC in\nearly decoherence dynamics, regardless of h\u0304, and irrespective of the system potential V (Q) [14]. Indeed, in the case\nof f (Q) = Q Eq. (2) reduces to an important result, previously obtained quantum mechanically [10]:\n1\n2\n\u03c4c,2\n\n=\n\n1\n2\n\u03c4q,2\n\n=2\n\nN\n\u03b4 2 Q X Cj2\n\u03b2h\u0304\u03c9j\ncoth(\n).\nh\u0304 j=1 2mj \u03c9j\n2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the initial state of the system is assumed to be pure, with the initial variance in Q given by \u03b4 2 Q. (3) For\nnonlinear f (Q) where \u2206f /\u2206Q 6= df /dQ over the range of the initial state, QCC can be very poor.\nThe second-order perturbative treatment is most reliable at short times and for weak decoherence. The results are\nparticularly significant for studies of decoherence control where early-time dynamics of weak decoherence is important.\nIn these circumstances it is useful to understand the extent to which (quantum) decoherence is equivalent to classical\nentropy production, i.e. to increasing Sc (t). In particular, if there exists good correspondence between classical and\nquantum decoherence dynamics, then the essence of decoherence control is equivalent to the suppression of classical\nentropy production, and various classical tools may be considered to achieve decoherence control. If not, then fully\nquantum tools are required.\nAs an example, consider decoherence for an initial superposition state of two well-separated and strongly localized\nGaussian wavepackets located at Qa = Qab \u2212 \u2206Qab /2 and Qb = Qab + \u2206Qab /2 with Qab = 0. For this initial state,\n\n\f3\n\u00032\n\u0002\n\u00032\n\u0002\n2\n2\n\u223c (Cb /h\u0304)\u2206Q2ab \u2206f (Qab )/\u2206Qab . Then in a cubic decoherence\n1/\u03c4c,2\n\u223c (Cb /h\u0304)\u2206Q2ab df (Qab )/dQab , and 1/\u03c4q,2\n2\nmodel, for example, where f (Q) = Q3 , one would obtain 1/\u03c4c,2\n\u223c 0 since df (Qab )/dQab = 0. However, here\n2\n2\n1/\u03c4q,2 >> 1/\u03c4c,2 , i.e. there is appreciable decoherence without classical entropy production. By contrast, in another\n2\nnonlinear decoherence model where f (Q) = sin(2\u03c0Q/\u2206Qab + \u03c0/4), 1/\u03c4q,2\n\u223c 0 since f (Qa ) = f (Qb ). Here, however,\n2\n2\n1/\u03c4c,2 >> 1/\u03c4q,2 , i.e., the system is decoherence-free but with substantial classical entropy production. Since we find\n2\n2\nthat the ratio of \u03c4q,2\nto \u03c4c,2\nin early-time decoherence dynamics is independent of h\u0304 for fixed initial state, these two\nexamples lead to a rather counter-intuitive result: given a macroscopic object which is initially in a superposition\nstate of two distinguishable states and is nonlinearly coupled with an environment, classical dynamics could totally\nfail to predict its initial entropy production or its decoherence rate. Indeed, Eqs. (2) and (3) suggest that, as\n2\n2\nlong as df (Q)/dQ 6= 0 and |f (Q)| is bounded, then 1/\u03c4q,2\nsaturates with increasing \u2206Qab , whereas 1/\u03c4c,2\ndoes not.\nThus, one can conclude that decoherence dynamics must be quantum and that the system-environment coupling\nmust be nonlinear if the saturation behavior of early-time decoherence rates is observed experimentally[15]. Further,\nit is clear that in the limit of large \u2206Qab , classical decoherence dynamics in the general case of nonlinear systemenvironment coupling predicts much faster decoherence than does quantum decoherence dynamics. This leads to the\nrather surprising inference that initial superposition states of well-separated wavepackets would be more susceptible\nto nonlinear system-environment coupling if they are propagated by classical dynamics than by quantum mechanics.\nTo go beyond the perturbation results we now consider a strong decoherence model in which decoherence is assumed\nto be much faster than the system dynamics, so that H s can be set to zero [1]. We consider both the \"off-diagonal\nelements\" \u03c1\u0303c (Q1 , Q2 , t) as well as the entropy Sc (t) and compare them to the quantum results.\nIn this case the classical Liouville dynamics gives\nN\n\n\u2202Fc [Q, \u2206Q, {qj , pj }, t] X \u2202Hkb \u2202Fc [Q, \u2206Q, {qj , pj }, t]\n=\n\u2202t\n\u2202qk\n\u2202pk\nk=1\n\n\u2212\n\nN\nX\n\nk=1\n\nN\n\n\u2202Hkb \u2202Fc [Q, \u2206Q, {qj , pj }, t] X\n\u2202Fc [Q, \u2206Q, {qj , pj }, t]\n+\nCk f (Q)\n\u2202pk\n\u2202qk\n\u2202pk\nk=1\n\ni\n\u2212 \u2206Q\nh\u0304\n\nN\nX\n\nk=1\n\nCk\n\ndf (Q)\nqk Fc [Q, \u2206Q, {qj , pj }, t],\ndQ\n\n(5)\n\nR\nwhere Fc (Q, \u2206Q, {qj , pj }, t) \u2261 dP exp[i\u2206QP/h\u0304]\u03c1c [Q, P, {qj , pj }, t]. Since Q\u0307 = 0 due to Hs = 0, and \u2206Q is a\ntime-independent parameter introduced in the Fourier transformation, Eq.

Interestingly, the classical result [Eq. (9)] displays two dynamical aspects of \u03c1\u0303c (Q1 , Q2 , t), i.e., coherent dynamics of its phase \u03c6c (t), and incoherent decay due to bath statistics.\nThe classical linear entropy Sc (t) can then be obtained from Eq.

[16] to nonlinear f (Q) using a simple approach and demonstrate a direct classical\nanalog to quantum strong decoherence dynamics.\nSince dB2 (t)/dt(t = 0) = 0 and d2 B2 (t)/dt2 (t = 0) = Cb /h\u0304, one finds that in the short time limit, Eqs. (10) and\n2\n2\n(12) reduce to previous perturbation results of 1/\u03c4c,1, 1/\u03c4c,2\n, 1/\u03c4q,1 , and 1/\u03c4q,2\n. Furthermore, the classical results\n[Eqs. (9) and (10)] are again much similar to the quantum results [Eqs. (11) and (12)], with the only difference being\nthat \u2206f /\u2206Q in the quantum expression is replaced by df /dQ in the classical result.\nThis result makes clear that our previous QCC results based upon second-order perturbation theory\nare generalizable to all orders of time in the strong decoherence case.\nIn particular, defining \u03b3c (t) \u2261\n\u0002\n\u00032\n2\n\u02c6\nd ln |\u03c1\u0303c (Q1 , Q2 , t)|/dt and \u03b3q (t) \u2261 d ln |hQ1 |\u03c1\u0303(t)|Q\ni|/dt,\nwe\nhave\n\u03b3\n(t)\n=\n\u2212(\u2206Q)\ndf (Q)/dQ (dB2 (t)/dt), and\n2\nc\n\u0002\n\u00032\n\u03b3q (t) = \u2212(\u2206Q)2 \u2206f (Q)/\u2206Q (dB2 (t)/dt). Then, in the case of linear and/or quadratic coupling, e.g., f (Q) =\naQ + bQ2 , one has \u03b3c (t) = \u03b3q (t) and Sc (t) = Sq (t), showing that there is perfect QCC in decoherence dynamics for\nall times.\nBy contrast, in the case of nonlinear coupling, \u03b3c (t) in general does not saturate with increasing \u2206Q whereas\n\u03b3q (t) does saturate for bounded |f (Q)|. As such, in the limit of large \u2206Q, one has |\u03b3c (t)| >> |\u03b3q (t)| and thus\n[1 \u2212 Sc (t)] << [1 \u2212 Sq (t)] as t increases, with |\u03b3c (t)/\u03b3q (t)| independent of h\u0304. This observation is of conceptual\nimportance: it says that decoherence can dramatically improve QCC, but as far as some detailed characteristics\nof decoherence dynamics are concerned, decoherence itself does not necessarily suffice to ensure that the dynamics\nof quantum entropy production equals that of classical entropy production. That is, even in the presence of strong\ndecoherence, subtle quantum classical differences may persist in some measures (e.g., 1/[1 \u2212 Sq (t)] vs. 1/[1 \u2212 Sc(t)]) for\nall finite times. Note, however, the entropy measures such as 1/[1 \u2212 Sq (t)] are not a quantum mechanical observables\nand hence do not allow one to directly measure the subtle difference between classical and quantum decoherence\ndynamics at later times.\nThus, from both the perturbation and strong decoherence results, we obtain that QCC depends critically upon the\ninitial quantum state and the nature of the system-environment coupling. This result should have an impact on our\ncurrent understanding of decoherence even when the role of the dynamics of the system is important. For example, it\nis worthwhile reexamining the relationship between classical Lyapunov exponents and decoherence rates in classically\nchaotic systems, since previous studies [17] only dealt with the case of linear system-environment coupling.\nIn conclusion, we have examined, using analogous measures, the decoherence dynamics of an initial quantum state\ncoupled to a bath that is subjected to either classical or quantum dynamics. Within the framework of a secondorder perturbative treatment and a strong decoherence theory, we have exposed the system-independent conditions\nunder which the quantum decoherence dynamics is either well, or poorly, approximated by classical dynamics. Further\nstudies are ongoing to assess QCC in cases beyond the short time and strong decoherence approximations. Preliminary\ncomputational results [8] support the conclusions drawn herein.\nThis work was supported by the U.S. Office of Naval Research and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research\nCouncil of Canada.\n\n\f5\n\n[1] W.H.
