INTRODUCTION\n\nDamped Lyman Alpha systems on the sightlines\nto background quasars exhibit high neutral hydrogen\ncolumn densities and are thought to arise in early\ndisk galaxies capable to sustain star formation (Wolfe\n1990). But over the last decade, only about a dozen\nDLA galaxies have been identified and imaged (e.g.\nTurnshek, Rao & Nestor 2002; Chen et al. 2005).\nThe chance projection of the galaxy SBS 1543+593\n(z=0.0096) and the background QSO HS 1543+5921\n(z=0.807) 2.4\" away from the center of the galaxy\n(Fig. 1) was discovered by Reimers & Hagen (1998).\nBowen, Tripp, & Jenkins (2001) and Bowen et al.\n(2001) noticed that the galaxy gives rise to a DLA system in the spectrum of the QSO. Schulte-Ladbeck et al.\n(2004a) studied SBS 1543+593 using HST imaging\nand ground based spectroscopy. They classified it an\nSm dwarf galaxy with properties that are entirely in\nline with those of other local dwarf galaxies. Several\nof 33 HST-discovered HII regions were analyzed with\nemission-line diagnostics. For the brightest region (#5)\nall emission lines necessary to derive the O and N\nabundances were detected.\nSBS 1543+593 offers an excellent opportunity to directly compare element abundances inferred from cool\ninterstellar gas (DLAs) and ionized gas (SFGs). None\nof the previously imaged DLA galaxies resolves to show\nindividual HII regions. In none of them, does the sightline to the QSO intercept the disk of the galaxy well\nwithin its optical radius, let alone, close to its center, thus eliminating concerns over metallicity gradients.\nSBS 1543+593 facilitates an important inquiry into the\n\nbehavior of galaxy metallicities with redshift, because\nalmost all available abundances at high redshifts are\ndetermined from QSO absorption line studies and refer to iron-peak elements such as Zn and Cr (Pettini\n2004), whereas at low redshifts, derivations of chemical abundances are based on nebular emission-line studies in star-forming regions, and are primarily, based on\nthe alpha-capture element oxygen (e.g. Garnett 2004).\nChen et al. (2005) recently derived O abundances from\nemission-lines in one DLA and one sub-DLA galaxy; the\nQSOs' spectra allowed them to determine absorptionline abundances of Fe. These data are not suited to\nthe comparison we are interested in here, because Fe is\na highly depleted element; we do not know the \u03b1/Fe\nratio; and their QSOs have impact parameters larger\nthan the optical disks of the galaxies. SBS 1543+593\nis unique, since it enables a direct comparison between\nthe emission- and absorption-line techniques, and allows\nalpha element abundances of a DLA and its host galaxy\nto be contrasted in a low-redshift QSO-galaxy pair.\n2. OBSERVATIONS\n\nTwo sets of HST/STIS observations of the QSO\nHS 1543+5921 were performed (ID 9784, PI Bowen) using grating G140M with a dispersion of 0.05 \u00c5/pix and\ncentered on 1222.0 \u00c5 and on 1272.0 \u00c5. We averaged the\nfive exposures per configuration to one single spectrum\nin order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio.\nThe spectrum centered on 1222.0 \u00c5 covers the\nNI(1199.5 \u00c5, 1200.2 \u00c5, 1200.7 \u00c5) triplet. The continuum\nis very noisy; and the lines are located in the blue wing\nof the Galactic Lyman \u03b1 line. For each line, we measure\na lower and upper limit to its EW, by varying the conElectronic address: rsl@phyast.pitt.edu, bkoenig@phyast.pitt.edu, cmiller@noao.edu,\nahopkins@anu.phyast.pitt.edu,\ndio@ipac.calthech.edu,\ntinuum placement.\nThis results in 6 EW\nvalues, each of\n1 Physics & Astronomy Department, University of Pittsburgh,\nwhich has a large uncertainty.

ABUNDANCE ANALYSIS - NEUTRAL GAS\n\nFig. 1.- GMOS-N observations of SBS 1543+593 using\nthe r G0303 filter.\nTo facilitate comparison with Fig. 1 of\nSchulte-Ladbeck et al. (2004a), we marked the position of the QSO\nwhich is located in the background of the galaxy, and a foreground\nstar. Notice the extended spiral-arm system of the galaxy that is\nnot visible on the HST images of Schulte-Ladbeck et al. (2004a).\n\nsurement as a lower limit. SII(\u03bbobs = 1265.85 \u00c5) is\nunblended and the continuum level is well determined.\nSII(\u03bbobs = 1271.61 \u00c5) is blended with a nearby SiII line.\nWe used two Gaussian profiles to deblend the two lines.\nFor an overview of the measured values see Tab. 1.\nWe performed deep optical imaging using GMOS-N\n(see Fig. 1) equipped with the r G0303 filter, a broad\nband filter (5620 - 6980 \u00c5) with an effective wavelength\nof 6300 \u00c5. A total of six dithered 300 sec exposures were\ntaken. After pipeline calibration the images were averaged to increase the signal-to-noise ratio.\nThe HST image published by Schulte-Ladbeck et al.\n(2004a) showed only the inner saturated region of the\nnew GMOS-N image. We now detect extended spiral\narms with associated HII regions. Note also the two features to the NE which are only revealed in this deep image. The image suggests a morphology which is still consistent with the previous classification of SBS 1543+593\nas an Sm galaxy. Photometry of 193 regions within the\nimage which are more extended than the stellar pointspread function was performed using the IRAF task\nDAOPHOT. Up to 140 could be HII regions, based on\nthe fact that they lie within the disk of the galaxy. Spectroscopy is needed to confirm their nature and to measure\ntheir chemical abundances.\n\nThe abundances of sulfur and nitrogen are derived using the measurements of the EWs and calculating the\nrest-equivalent width (REW ) using the redshift of the\ngalaxy. Together with the oscillator strengths or f values of Morton (1991) we derive column densities (N )\nfrom eq. 8 of (Petitjean 1998). This expression is only\napplicable to optically thin absorption lines on the linear part of the curve of growth. Table 1 shows that the\nequivalent widths of the three S lines used, are in the\nsame ratio as their f values (within the errors), so assuming the optically thin case appears to be valid. However, we must be concerned that the spectral resolution\nis insufficient to discern if there are any narrow saturated\ncomponents contributing to the absorption lines. If such\ncomponents are present, we may have underestimated\nthe column density of S (but this would not invalidate\nthe main result of the paper).\nIn the following we will introduce a new nomenclature5 . [Y/X]I refers to the element abundance of element\nY with respect to element X in the neutral gas measured\nusing absorption line diagnostics while [Y/X]II refers to\nit measured in HII regions by emission line diagnostics.\nEach of the 6 nitrogen REW s is converted to a column\ndensity. Considering the above-mentioned measurement\nuncertainties, we give a range, (0.12 \u2013 1.80) 1014 cm\u22122 ,\nrather than a mean value for the column density. Consequently, we derive \u22122.6 . [N/H]I . \u22122.0, and adopting the solar nitrogen abundance of 7.931 \u00b1 0.111 from\nHolweger (2001).\nWe use a solar sulfur abundance of 7.20\n(Grevesse & Sauval 1998). This is consistent with\nProchaska et al. (2003b). Note that Holweger (2001)\ndoes not provide a sulfur abundance for the Sun.\nThe REWs (\u03bb\u03bb = 1254, 1259) listed in Tab. 1, were\nused to calculate N (SII) = (1.10 \u00b1 0.31) 1015 cm\u22122 or\n[SII/H]I = \u22120.50 \u00b1 0.33.\nThe ionization energies for sulfur are SI: 10.36 eV and\nfor SII: 23.33 eV. Abundance corrections in DLAs for ionization energies higher than h\u03bd > 13.6 eV are not necessary because these absorbers are optically thick to such\nradiation. We therefore do not apply a correction for\nSIII. For photons with energies h\u03bd < 13.6 eV the HI gas\nis transparent and thus N (SII) = N (S).\nAssuming that DLAs arise in a neutral plus a mildly\n5\n\n[Y/X] = log(Y /X) \u2212 log(Y /X)\u2299\n\n\fSBS 1543+593\n\n3\n\nionized region, Vladilo et al. (2001) model ionization correction terms for sulfur. Depending on the ionization\nparameter U (the surface flux of ionizing photons divided by the hydrogen particle density) the correction\nwould be between 0.15 \u2265 log(C[S/H]I ) \u2265 \u22120.20 for\nlog N (H) = 20.34 (their Fig. 9). We consider this range\nof correction terms as an indication for the size of possible systematic errors in our abundance determination.\nThus we derive a sulfur abundance of [S/H]I = \u22120.50\u00b1\n0.33, or 0.29 solar.\n4.

The electron temperature is Te = 11300+2100\n\u22121500 K; and the electron density is\nne \u2248 80 cm\u22123 .\nWe use IONIC (Shaw & Dufour 1995) to derive abundances from the line-flux measurements. This results in\n[SII/H]II = \u22121.25 \u00b1 0.30 for the HII region. Errors are\nestimated by exploring the effects on the outcome of the\nmodel when varying the input values with their errors.\nAs a consistency check, we also calculate the abundance\nof SII/H by applying Eq. 11 of Pagel et al. (1992). This\ngives [SII/H]II = \u22121.31 \u00b1 0.45. The errors are calculated\nby error propagation. In the further text we will refer to\nthe value derived by using IONIC.\nNote that the spectra of Schulte-Ladbeck et al. (2004a)\ndo not cover the strong [SIII] lines at 9069 \u00c5, 9532 \u00c5.\nThe weak [SIII] line at 6312.06 \u00c5 was covered by the\nWHT ISIS R600R/TEK4 spectrum observed on 25 April\n2000. We measure a rest-frame flux of F6312 = (0.11 \u00b1\n0.09) 10\u221216 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 in HII region #5. This leads\nto [SIII/H]II = \u22120.32 \u00b1 0.30. To estimate the error we again explored the outcome of IONIC by varying the input values with their errors. Thus we derive\n[S/H]II = [SII + SIII/H]II = \u22120.27 \u00b1 0.30 for the total\nsulfur abundance. We calculate [SIII/H]II = \u22120.36\u00b10.40\nusing eq. 12 of Pagel et al. (1992) as a consistency check,\nthus [S/H]II = \u22120.31 \u00b1 0.30. As another check we apply\na correction factor from photoionization models to the\nmeasured SII abundance to account for SIII in the HII\nregion. Garnett (1989) intensively studied sulfur in extragalactic HII regions. Typically one observes two major ionization states: SII and SIII. Schulte-Ladbeck et al.\n(2004a) measured (OII/OI)II = 0.41. With this oxygen ratio we can correct for the unseen SIII. Using\nFig. 4 from Garnett (1989) leads to a correction factor\nof log(SII/SIII)II = \u22121.0 \u00b1 0.2; and we derive [S/H]II =\n\u22120.21 \u00b1 0.30. Whereas SIV becomes important in highly\nionized nebulae, or if (OII/OI)II < 0.3, the measured\n(OII/OI)II ratio suggests that this ion does not make an\nimportant contribution in our case.\n5. RESULTS\n\nThe measured sulfur column density in the neutral gas,\nN (SII) = 1.10 1015 cm\u22122 , is consistent with the prediction of Schulte-Ladbeck et al., N (SII) = 1.15 1015 cm\u22122 .\nThey used three methods to determine [O/H]II =\n\u22120.54 \u00b1 0.20. HST/FOS data revealed [O/H]I > \u22122.14.\nHere we find [S/H]II = \u22120.27 \u00b1 0.30, and [S/H]I =\n\nFig. 3.- Metallicity as a function of redshift. The dashed\nlines indicate the minimum and maximum local-universe values of\n[O/H]II (see text). The bright circles are values of [O/H]II for HII\nregions and SFGs from the SDSS. The black squares are values\nof [O, S, Si/H]I from the compilation of Prochaska et al. (2003a).\nThe neutral ([S/H]I ) and ionized ([O/H]II ) gas phase abundances\nof SBS 1543+593 are overlayed. Their agreement indicates that\nthe metallicities of SFGs and DLAs can be interpreted within the\nsame framework.\n\n\u22120.50 \u00b1 0.33. Within the errors these four values are\nthe same. Schulte-Ladbeck et al. derived log (N/O)II =\n\u22121.40+0.20\nHere, we calculate a range of \u22122.0 .\n\u22120.30 .\nlog (N/S)I . \u22120.8. Again, we find agreement.\n6. DISCUSSION\n\nFigure 3 offers a comparison between the metallicities ([O/H]II ) of local SFGs and the metallicities ([O,\nS, Si/H]I ) of high redshift DLAs. Synthesized in massive stars, O and Si are both made by alpha capture, while S originates from the explosive burning of O\n(Woosley, Heger & Weaver 1990). Nissen et al. (2004)\nrecently studied S in Galactic halo stars, and showed empirically that S behaves like an alpha-capture element.\nThus we use it as a proxy for O. Note that the gas-phase\nSi abundances may be slightly underestimated in DLAs\nsince Si depletes onto dust grains.\nIn the local universe, accurate oxygen abundances are\ndetermined using the direct, or Te method. I Zw 18 is the\nlocal galaxy with the lowest oxygen abundance on record,\n\u22121.56\u00b10.01 (Izotov & Tuan 1999). Even the analysis of\na large sample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectra using the Te method (Kniazev et al. 2004) has not\nturned up a galaxy with a lower oxygen abundance. Neither has a lower abundance been found in the outskirts\nof local spirals (van Zee et al. 1998). The local HII region with the highest known oxygen abundance, 0.2 \u00b1\n0.2, resides in NGC 1232 (Castellanos, D\u00edaz & Terlevich\n2002). These minimum and maximum values are indicated in Fig. 3 by dashed lines.\nTo illustrate the oxygen abundances at low redshifts,\nwe plot on Fig. 3, oxygen abundances for local HII regions\nand SFGs from the SDSS, using the selection criteria described in Schulte-Ladbeck et al. (2004b) and applying\nthe O3N2 strong-line indices of Pettini & Pagel (2004)\n\n\f4\n\nSchulte-Ladbeck et al.\n\nafter adding 1.3 \u00c5 to the rest equivalent widths of H\u03b1\nand H\u03b2 to account for underlying stellar Balmer absorption (Hopkins et al. 2003). The median error based on\nline fluxes is 0.05; and following Pettini & Pagel, the\nsystematic errors are 0.14 (their eq. 3) and 0.18 (their\neq. 2). Our illustrative [O/H] values for the redshift\nrange from 0 to 0.3, span the range from \u22121.2 to 0.2,\nand represent well, local Te -based values. Note that our\nmedian metallicities are systematically lower than those\nderived by Tremonti et al. (2004) for SDSS SFGs; this\nis presumably due to different methodologies. Adopting their [O/H] ratios would exacerbate the difference\nbetween SFG and DLA metallicities.\nFor the DLAs, we plot on Fig. 3 the [O/H]I , [S/H]I , and\n[Si/H]I ratios from the compilation of Prochaska et al.\n(2003a). The median [\u03b1/H] error in this sample is 0.1.\nOur main observations are the following: [O, S, Si/H]I\nof high-redshift DLAs, go down to \u22122.6. Such low metallicities are unobserved in the local universe! DLA metallicities reach as high as [O, S, Si/H]I of \u22120.4, but never\nonce do they attain super-solar values, observed in local\ngalaxies. Are these two populations at all comparable?\nWe enter on Fig. 3 the values for SBS1543+593 as follows. For the neutral-gas abundance, we show [S/H]I ,\nand for the ionized-gas abundance, we show [O/H]II .\nHere is one DLA for which we can demonstrate that in\nprinciple, emission- and absorption-line techniques give\nthe same results when chemical elements with similar nucleosynthetic origins are compared at similar locations\nwithin a DLA galaxy.\nThere have long been discussions about whether or\nnot emission- and absorption-line diagnostics yield the\nsame chemical abundances in SFGs when one uses\nthe internal star-forming regions rather than a QSO\nas the background light source for the absorption experiment (e.g. Pettini & Lipman 1995; Pettini et al.\n2002; Aloisi et al. 2003; Lecavalier des Etangs et al.\n2004). There is as yet no agreement on the issue.\nA few recent studies have addressed chemical abundances in (sub-)DLAs; but these works do not compare the same elements in absorption and in emission (e.g. Christensen et al. 2005; Ellison et al. 2005;\nChen et al. 2005). The case we have here doesn't suffer\nfrom any of these uncertainties. Furthermore, in other\nDLA galaxies, the QSO intercepts the galaxy's disks at\nmuch larger impact parameter, so internal metallicity\ngradients have to be accounted for. Therefore, our's is\nthe cleanest comparison made to date between emission-\n\nand absorption-line abundances in a DLA/SFG.\nThe agreement between the metallicity in the neutral\nand the ionized gas phase of SBS 1543+593 validates in\nprinciple, the comparisons between the two types of objects, SFGs and DLAs, on the metallicity versus redshift\ndiagram. SBS 1543+593 thus makes the case that metal\nenrichment has taken place in the gas-rich, star-forming\ngalaxy population between redshifts of 5 and 0.\nIn practice, galaxy metallicity gradients must be important for a detailed comparison between SFG and\nDLA metallicities. DLAs are merely defined by a neutral H column density threshold; yet we do not know\nwhere a given DLA line is produced within a highredshift galaxy's disk. Galaxy metallicity gradients have\nbeen investigated for local disk galaxies; but it remains\nto be seen how they behave as a function of redshift.\nFirst insights on this issue are provided by the work of\nChen et al. (2005).\n7. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe investigated O/H, S/H and N/O ratios in the ionized gas of the DLA galaxy SBS 1543+593, and compared it with O/H, S/H, and N/S ratios in its neutral\ngas. We find that the metallicities in the ionized and\nneutral gas agree within the errors. The experiment allows us to interpret DLA metallicities as an extension of\nSFG metallicities to high redshift, suggesting that gasrich galaxies had lower metallicities at higher redshifts,\nwhen they were younger.\nThis paper is based in part on HST archival data.
