For n < 1 this regime is characterised by\nan integral scale L(t) \u223c t2/(3+n) , which increases with the time due to the multiple\nmergings of the shocks, and therefore, the energy of a random wave decays more slowly\nthan the energy of a periodic signal.\nIn this paper a deterministic model of turbulence-like evolution is considered. We\nconstruct the initial perturbation as a piecewise linear analog of the Weierstrass function. The wavenumbers of this function form a \"Weierstrass spectrum\", which accumulates at the origin in geometric progression. \"Reverse\" sawtooth functions with\nnegative initial slope are used in this series as basic functions, while their amplitudes\nare chosen by the condition that the distribution of energy over exponential intervals\nof wavenumbers is the same as for the continuous spectrum in Burgers turbulence.\nCombining these two ideas allows us to obtain an exact analytical solution for the\n\n1\n\n\fvelocity field. We also notice that such multiscale waves may be constructed for multidimensional Burgers' equation.\nThis solution has scaling exponent h = \u2212(1 + n)/2 and its evolution in time is selfsimilar with logarithmic periodicity and with the same average law L(t) as for Burgers\nturbulence. Shocklines form self-similar regular tree-like structures. This model also\ndescribes important properties of the Burgers turbulence such as the self-preservation\nof the evolution of large scale structures in the presence of small scales perturbations.\n\nPACS 43.25.Cb,47.27.Eq.\nKeywords: Burgers' equation; Burgers turbulence\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe nonlinear diffusion equation\n\u2202v\n\u22022v\n\u2202v\n+v\n= \u03bd 2 ; v(x, t = 0) = v0 (x).\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\n(1.1)\n\nwas originally introduced by J.M.Burgers in [6] (1939) as a model for hydrodynamical turbulence. Burgers' equation (1.1) describes two fundamental effects characteristic of any\nturbulence [10]: the nonlinear redistribution of energy over the spectrum and the action\nof viscosity in small scales. Burgers' equation was used later to describe a large class of\nphysical systems in which the nonlinearity is fairly weak (quadratic) and the dispersion is\nnegligible compared to the linear damping [29]. The most important example of such waves\nare acoustical waves with finite amplitude [24]. Another class of problems, arising, e.g., in\nsurface growth, also leads to Burgers' equation [5],[8],[30]. The three dimensional form of\n(1.1) has been used in cosmology to describe the formation of large scale structures of the\nUniverse at a nonlinear stage of gravitational instability ( see e.g. [15], [25], [13], [28] ).\nIn the physically important case of large Reynolds number, the action of viscosity is\nsignificant only in the small regions with high gradient of the velocity field. In the limit\n\u03bd \u2192 0, the solution of Burgers' equation has the following form (see [18], [7], [13]):\nv(x, t) =\n\nx \u2212 y(x, t)\n,\nt\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere y(x, t) is the coordinate of the maximum of the function\nG(x, y, t) = \u03a80 (y) \u2212\n\n(x \u2212 y)2\n\u2202\u03a80 (x)\n, v0 (x) = \u2212\n.\n2t\n\u2202x\n\n(1.3)\n\nStrong interaction between coherent harmonics leads to the appearance of local selfsimilar structures in Burgers' equation. A periodic initial perturbation with zero mean\nvelocity is transformed asymptotically into a sawtooth wave with gradient \u2202x v = 1/t and\nwith the same period l0 . It is important that at this stage the amplitude a(t) = l0 /t and\nthe energy density \u03c3 2 (t) \u2243 l02 /12t2 do not depend on the initial amplitude.\n2\n\n\fAn initial one-signed pulse with the area m > 0, localised at t = 0 in the neighbourhood\nof the point x = 0, also has asymptotically a universal form: it transforms into a triangular\npulse with the gradient \u2202x v = 1/t and increasing coordinate of the shock xs \u2248 (2mt)1/2 . Due\nto the increase of the integral scale the amplitude of such a pulse a(t) = xs (t)/t \u223c m1/2 t\u22121/2\nand its energy will decrease more slowly than for a periodic signal, like t\u22121/2 .\nContinuous random initial fields are also transformed into sequences of regions with the\nsame gradient \u2202x v = 1/t, but with random locations of the shocks separating them. Due\nto the multiple merging of the shocks the statistical properties of such random fields are\nalso self-similar and may be characterised by the integral scale of the turbulence L(t). The\nmerging of the shocks leads to an increase of the integral scale L(t), and because of this the\nenergy\n\u03c3 2 (t) \u223c L2 (t)/t2\n(1.4)\nof a random wave decreases more slowly than the energy of periodic signals.\nThe type of turbulence evolution is determined by the behaviour of the large scale part\nof the initial energy spectrum\nE0 (k) = \u03b12 k n b0 (k);\n(1.5)\nZ\n1\nhv0 (x), v0 (x + z)ieikz dz.\n(1.6)\nE0 (k) =\n2\u03c0\nHere b0 (k) is a function which falls off rapidly for k > k0 \u223c l0 , and b0 (0) = 1. For\nn > 1 the law of enrgy decay strongly depends on the statistical properties of the initial\nfield (see e.g. [30] and references therein). For the initial Gaussian perturbation the integral\nscale L(t) \u223c t1/2 times logarithmic correction obtains and is determined by two integral\ncharacteristics of the initial spectrum: the variances of the initial potential \u03a80 and the\nvelocity v0 (x) [20],[9],[13],[16].\nFor n < 1 the structure function of the initial potential increases as a power law in space.\nThen the initial potential field is Brownian, or fractional Brownian motion, and some scaling\nmay be used [7],[20], [13], [26], [3],[22], [23]. In this case the turbulence is also self-similar\nand the integral scale L(t) increases as\nL(t) = (\u03b1t)2/(3+n) .\n\n(1.7)\n\nThe energy of the turbulence is derived from (1.4):\n\u03c3 2 (t) \u223c t\u2212p , p =\n\n2(n + 1)\n.\nn+3\n\n(1.8)\n\nThe difference between these two cases ( n < 1 and n > 1 ) is connected to the process of\nparametric generation of low frequency component of the spectrum. For the case n < 1 the\nnewly generated low frequency components are relatively small and we have the conservation\nof large scale part of the spectrum:\nE(k, t) = E0 (k) = \u03b12 k n , f or k << 1/L(t).\n\n(1.9)\n\nThus, the laws of turbulent decay are more complex than for simple signals, which can\nbe attributed to multiple merging of the shocks. In [12] a model of a regular fractal signal\n3\n\n\fwith decay lower than for single one-signed pulse was introduced. The initial signal v0 (x)\nwas constructed as a sequence of one-signed pulses whose positions form a Cantor set with\ncapacity (fractal dimension) D = ln N/ ln \u03b2, where N p is the number of pulses in the scale\nLp \u2243 L1 N\u03b2 p\u22121 , 0 < D < 1. Multiple merging makes the decay of the wave slower and\nthe general behaviour of the energy decay may be approximated by the power law with the\nexponent in (1.8):\n1\u2212D\n, 0 < p < 1.\n(1.10)\np=\n2\u2212D\nThe evolution proves to be self-similar in successive time periods (ti , ti\u22121 ) and (ti+1 , ti+2 ),\nwhere ti+1 /ti = \u03b2 2 /N. This shows log-periodical self-similarity of the field evolution. Linear\nand non-linear decay of fractal and spiral fields given by the sequences of regular pulses was\nalso investigated in [1]. It was shown that the power law (1.8) with the exponent given by\nthe formula (1.10) holds also true for homogeneous fractal pulse signal with capacity D.\nAnother model of a multiscale signal, which has the same general behaviour on the\nexternal scale L(t) (1.7), and energy of the Burgers turbulence, was also discussed in [12]. It\nwas assumed therein that the initial signal is a discrete set of modes - the spatial harmonics\nv0 (x) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nap sin(kp x + \u03c6p ),\n\n(1.11)\n\np=0\n\nwith wavenumbers kp and amplitudes ap given in terms of a parameter \u01eb by\nkp = k0 \u01ebp ,\nap = a0 \u01eb\u2212hp ,\nn+1\n(n+1)/2\nh = \u2212(\n), a0 = \u03b1k0\n.\n2\n\n(1.12)\n\nAmplitudes ap and the scaling exponent h are chosen from the condition that the mean\nenergy of harmonics in the interval \u2206p = kp \u2212 kp+1 be identical to that corresponding to the\nspectral density (1.5): a2p = E(kp )\u2206p . For \u01eb << 1 and n > \u22121 the harmonics are spread\nover the spatial spectrum and accumulate at the point k = 0 with decreasing amplitude.\nThe main approach in this model was that the energy of the wave is the sum of energies of\nindependent modes. The approach is nontrivial, but nevertheless leads to the same laws of\nthe integral scale L(t) (1.7) and the energy decay (1.8) as in the case of continuous spectrum\n(1.5). Let us point out that representation of the field given by the formula (1.11) is similar\nto shell models, which were introduced as useful models addressing the problem of analogous\nscaling in fully developed turbulence (see, e.g., [11], [19] and references in there).\nIn present paper we consider the evolution of a regular signal whose behaviour in general\nis similar to the evolution of the Burgers turbulence with continuous spectrum (1.5). The\nmain difference,as compared to the model discussed above, is that we construct the exact\nsolution of Burgers' equation using as an initial mode the \"reverse\" sawtooth wave. The\nfrequency ratio in our model is \u01eb = 1/N, where N is an integer and N \u2265 2. These perturbation are similar to the well known Weierstrass and Weierstrass-Mandelbrot fractal functions\n(see [21], [4]).\nFor the analysis of Burgers' equation it is convenient to use a mechanical interpretation.\nThere is a one-to-one correspondence between the solution of Burgers' equation and the\n4\n\n\fdynamic of a gas of inelastically interacting particles [13], [14]. Let us take a one-dimensional\nparticle flux with a contact interaction: as long as the particles do not run into each other\nthey move with constant velocity. In the collision they stick together, forming a deltafunction singularity in the matter density. This leads to the appearance of gas of two\nspecies: a hydrodynamical flux of the \"light\" initial particles, and a gas of \"heavy\" particles\narising in the adhesion process of light particles. The evolution of the particle velocity field\nwill be described by the solution of Burgers' equation if we assume that the initial density\nof the light particles is \u03c10 = const, the velocity of particles is equal to the initial velocity\nin (1.1), and that the collision of the particles conserve their mass and momentum. This\nanalogy permits construction of a very fast (linear time) algorithm of solution of Burgers'\nequation [27].\nIn our case, for the initial reverse sawtooth wave, all the matter turns into heavy particles\nat the same moment of time. Thus, after this time the evolution of the Burgers turbulence\nis fully determined by the motion of heavy particles, whose positions are positions of shocks,\nand masses are equal to \u2206v * t, where \u2206v are the amplitudes of the shocks.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we consider the evolution and interaction of \"reverse\" sawtooth modes. In section 3 we consider the interaction of small scale\nmode with large scale structures. In Section 4 we investigate the properties of the sawtooth\nWeierstrass-Mandelbrot fractal function. In section 5 we show that deterministic model has\nlogarithmic periodic self-similarity. We also discuss here the multi-dimensional generalization of this model. Section 5 presents concluding remarks.\n\n2\n\nEvolution and interaction of \"reverse\" sawtooth modes\nin Burgers' equation\n\nLet us introduce the pth \"reverse\" saw tooth mode as\nv(p) (x, 0) = ap A(kp x + \u03c6p )\n\n(2.1)\n\nHere ap , kp are amplitude and wavenumber of the mode, \u2212\u03c6p is its phase. The function\nA(x) is 2\u03c0 periodic function, given on its first period by the following expression\nA(x) = \u03c0 \u2212 x,\n\nx \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0[\n\n(2.2)\n\nThe set of \"reverse sawtooth\" functions is not orthogonal, but nevertheless we will introduce\na set of modes satisfying equation (1.12), whose wavenumbers and amplitudes satisfy the\nsame relations as the sinusoidal modes of [12], i.e. relation (1.11). We introduce the term\n\"reverse sawtooth\" because this signal is a sawtooth with teeth facing to the right, but the\nterm \"sawtooth\" by itself is widely used in Burgers turbulence literature to refer to the late\nstage of the evolution of the wave profile a sequence of sawteeth with positive slope 1/t.\nThe solution of Burgers' equation with a linear velocity profile v0 = \u2212\u03b3(x \u2212 x+ ) is\nwell-known (see, e.g., [13]):\n\u2212\u03b3(x \u2212 x+ )\n(2.3)\nv(x, t) =\n1 \u2212 \u03b3t\n5\n\n\fThe value \u03b3 \u22121 has the dimension of time, and for \u03b3 > 0, at the finite time t = \u03b3 \u22121 the\ngradient \u2202x v becames infinite. For \u03b3 < 0 the gradient becomes equal to \u2202x v = t\u22121 ,\nindependent of the value of \u03b3 at times t \u226b |\u03b3|\u22121 . Thus, we have from (1.12), (2.1),(2.2),\nthat the evolution of the pth mode is characterised by the nonlinear time\nn+3/2\n\ntp = \u03b3p\u22121 = ap kp \u22121 = t0 /(\u01eb(n+3)/2 )p , t0 = 1/\u03b1k0\n\n(2.4)\n\nBased on solution (2.3 ) it is easy to see that for the \"first\" period (if \u03c6p = 0) the evolution\nof the pth reverse mode at the initial stage (t < tp ) may be described as\nif 0 < x < ttp k\u03c0p ;\n1\n, if | k\u03c0p \u2212 x| < ttp k\u03c0p ;\nv(p) (x, t) = t1p ( k\u03c0p \u2212 x)/ 1\u2212t/t\np\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 (x \u2212 \u03c0 )/t,\nif ttp k\u03c0p < x \u2212 k\u03c0p < k\u03c0p .\nkp\n\uf8f1\nx/t,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\n(2.5)\n\nOn the other hand, at time t = tp , the mode transforms into a \"direct\" sawtooth wave with\nslope \u2202x v = 1/t , independent of the amplitude and wavenumber of the mode:\nv(p) (x, t) =\n\n(\n\nx/t,\n(x \u2212\n\nif 0 < x < k\u03c0p ;\n\u03c0\n)/t, if k\u03c0p < x < 2\u03c0\n.\nkp\nkp\n\n(2.6)\n\nThe density of energy \u03c3 2 (t) = hv 2 (x, t)iL , where hiL denotes averaging over the period, is\nconserved before t < tp , and decreases like (kp t)\u22122 after t > tp .\nConsider now the evolution of a gas of sticky particles in the case of independent evolution\nof the pth mode. In the general case, the density of the gas is calculated by using the Jacobian\nof the transformation from Lagrangian to Eulerian coordinates and may be written in the\nform ( see, e.g., [13] )\n\u03c1(x, t) = \u03c10 (1 \u2212 t\u2202x v(x, t))\n(2.7)\nThen it is obvious that at the initial stage\n\u03c1(x, t) = \u03c10\n\n1\n,\n1 \u2212 t/tp\n\n|\n\n\u03c0\nt \u03c0\n\u2212 x| <\nkp\ntp kp\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhile \u03c1 is zero outside this interval in each period. At time t = tp all the light particles in\neach period collide into a single heavy particle with mass\nmp = \u03c10 Lp = \u03c10\n\n2\u03c0\n,\nkp\n\n(2.9)\n\nand the heavy particles have positions\nxp,l =\n\n\u03c6p 2\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u2212\n+\nl;\nkp\nkp\nkp\n\nl = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, ...\n\n(2.10)\n\nequal to the zero positions of the initial pth mode. The process of light merging particles\nand the evolution of the velocity is shown in Fig.1.\n6\n\n\fConsider now the joint evolution of two successive modes: pth and (p + 1)th. From (2.4)\none can see that the ratio of nonlinear times of the successive modes is\ntp+1\n= \u01eb\u2212(n+3)/2 \u2261 \u01eb1\u2212h ,\ntp\n\n(2.11)\n\nwhich does not depend on p and increases if the exponent n is greater than \u22123. The gradient\nof the initial field v(p) (x) + v(p+1) (x) is \u2212(\u03b3p + \u03b3p+1 ), so the effective nonlinear time for\nsuch a sum is\ntp\n1\n=\n,\n(2.12)\ntp,ef f = tp,p+1 =\n\u03b3p + \u03b3p+1\n1 + tp /tp+1\nBecause all parts of the initial perturbation have the same slope, all light particles will collide\nat the same time t = tp,p+1.\nThe mass of heavy particles after merging are mp,i = \u03c10 \u2206i,i+1 , where \u2206i,i+1 is the distance\nbetween adjacent shocks in the initial perturbation. The ratio of periods of two adjacent\nmodes is Lp+1 /Lp = kp /kp+1 = \u01eb\u22121 . If N = \u01eb\u22121 is an integer larger than 1, there will be\nN + 1 heavy particles on the period of the larger scale mode (p + 1)th: (N \u2212 1) with the\nmass mp = \u03c10 Lp (2.9), and two particles with total mass equal to mp . These two particles\nonly exist when the shock of the (p + 1)th mode is located in the interval between shocks of\nthe pth mode. For simplicity, we will consider the case where the spatial relations\nkp+1\u03c6p+1 = kp \u03c6p + 2\u03c0r/N,\n\n(2.13)\n\nbetween the phases of successive modes, hold. In this case the discontinuities of the (p+1)th\nmode do not produce new shocks in the total perturbation v(p) (x)+v(p+1) (x). Thus, at times\nt larger than t > tr,ef f , the masses of all heavy particles will be the same, as would be the\ncase without the large scale modes (2.9).\nThe positions of these heavy particles at time t = tp,ef f are\nX(p,l) (tp,ef f ) = xp,l + v(p+1) (xp,l )tp,ef f ,\n\n(2.14)\n\nwhere xp,l are the zero positions of the pth mode (2.10). The velocity of this particle is equal\nto v(p+1) (xp,l ). Equation (2.14) is obvious if we use the trivial equality v(p) (xp,l )+v(p+1)(xp,l ) =\nv(p+1) (xp,l ), and also note that the position of the heavy particle xp,l (tp,ef f ) is equal to the\nposition at the same time of all light particles with initial coordinate x = xp,l . From (2.14)\nwe immediately have that after time tp,ef f the positions of the particles are\nX(p,l) (t) = x(p,l) + v(p+1) (xp,l )t.\n\n(2.15)\n\nThe difference between the coordinates of the adjacent particles Xp,l (t) and Xp,l+1(t) decreases with time, proportionally to the gradient of v(p+1) (x):\n\u2202v(p+1) (x)\n(xp,l+1 \u2212 xp,l ) \u2261\n\u2202x\n(xp,l+1 \u2212 xp,l )(1 \u2212 t/tp+1 ).\n\nX(p,l+1) (t) \u2212 Xp,l (t) = (xp,l+1 \u2212 xp,l ) \u2212 t\n\n7\n\n(2.16)\n\n\fThese particles collide at time t = tp+1 (2.4) and the newly created heavy particles will\nhave masses\nm(p+1) = \u03c10 Lp+1\n(2.17)\nand positions\nxp+1,l =\n\n\u03c0\nkp+1\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c6p+1\n2\u03c0l\n+\n;\nkp\nkp+1\n\nl = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, ...\n\n(2.18)\n\nThe velocity of these particles is zero.\nThus, at times t larger then tp+1 , the evolution of the initial perturbation v0 (x) = v(p) (x)+\nv(p+1) (x) will be the same as the evolution of only the large scale mode v(p+1) (x). The process\nof particles merging and the evolution of the velocity for the sum of two successive modes\nwith the periods ratio N = 2 are shown in Fig. 2.\nBy recurrence, it is evident that for finite number of modes v(x) = v(p) (x) + v(p+1) (x) +\n... + v(M ) (x) the evolution of the field after tM will be the same as the evolution of only\nthe largest mode v(M ) (x). The reason for this, is of course, the special relation between\nthe phases \u03c6p and the wavenumbers kp of all interacting modes: kp = k0 /N p ( see equation\n(1.12) ). For integer N the minimal value of any combination of these wavenumbers is\nequal to the largest mode wavenumber kM = k0 /N M . So the nonlinear interaction does not\nproduce new components at frequencies less than kM .\n\n3\n\nInteraction of small scale \"reverse\" sawtooth mode\nwith large scale structures\n\nLet us now consider the interaction of the pth mode with an infinite series of larger scale\nmodes\n\u221e\n\u221e\nWp (x) =\n\nX\n\nr=p+1\n\nvr (x) \u2261\n\nX\n\nar A(kr x + \u03c6r ),\n\n(3.1)\n\nr=p+1\n\nassuming that the phases of the modes satisfy the relations ( 2.13 ) and that kr = k0 \u01ebr , ar =\na0 \u01eb\u2212hr , h = \u2212(n + 1)/2. From (3.1) and (2.4) we have for the gradient of the initial\nperturbation v0 (x) = vp (x) + Wp (x)\n\u2202x v0 (x)\n\n= \u2202x vp (x) + \u2202x Wp (x) =\n= \u03b30\n\nr=p (\u01eb\n\nP\u221e\n\n(n+3)\n2\n\n)r = \u03b3 0 \u01eb\n\nP\u221e\n\nr=p\n\n(n+3)\np\n2\n\n\u03b3p =\n1\n\n(n+3)\n1\u2212\u01eb 2\n\n,\n\n(3.2)\n\nthe condition n > \u22123 (h < 1) being necessary for the series to converge. From (3.2), we\nhave for the effective time of nonlinearity of pth mode\nt\u0303p = 1/\u2202x v0 (x) = tp (1 \u2212 \u01eb\nwith the original tp determined by the equation (2.4).\n\n8\n\n(n+3)\n2\n\n),\n\n(3.3)\n\n\fThus, after the time of collision t\u0303p , heavy particles with mass mp = \u03c10 Lp (3.2) appear.\nThe coordinates of these particles will be determined by an equation similar to (2.15)\nxp,l (t) = xp,l (t) + Wp (xp,l )t,\n\n(3.4)\n\nwith the velocity of particles determined by the function Wp (x) (see 3.1), which is a sum of\nall larger modes, and xp,l are the coordinates of the zeros of the pth modes. The difference\nbetween the coordinates of adjacent particles xp,l and xp,l will then decrease with time like\n(1 \u2212 t/t\u0303p+1 ), where t\u0303p+1 = tp+1 (1 \u2212 \u01eb(n+3)/2 ) is the inverse of the gradient of the function\nWp (x), see (3.1) and (3.2). Thus, the time of particle collision for this generation will be\ndescribed by equation (3.3) with p = p + 1, and the new masses will be determined by the\nperiod of the (p + 1)th mode - see equation (2.17).\nThe extrapolation of this particle merging process to the next generations is evident by\nn+3\nrecurrence. The qth collision of heavy particles takes place at time t\u0303p+q = tp+q (1 \u2212 \u01eb 2 ),\nthe masses of these particles at this time are determined by the period of the (p + q)th mode\nmp+q = \u03c10 Lp+q = 2\u03c0\u03c10 /kp+q (2.9), (2.17). In the time interval t \u2208 [t\u0303p+q , t\u0303p+q+1],\n(n+3)\nn+3\nt\u0303p+q+1\n= \u01eb\u2212 2 = N 2 ;\nt\u0303p+q\n\n(3.5)\n\nthe coordinates of particles will be determined by the equation (3.4) with p = p + q. Here\nWp+q (x) is the sum of the velocities of all larger modes with r > p + q, and xp+q,l are the\nzeros of (p + q)-th mode. It is important to note that at time t > t\u0303p+q the evolution of the\nparticles is solely determined by the modes with r \u2265 p + q. It means, that at times t > t\u0303p+q\nthe position of the particles does not depend on the presence in the initial condition of the\nsmall scale modes with r < p + q.\nThus, two processes with different initial velocities: \u1e7d0 (x), the field with small scales,\nand v0 (x), the field without small scales modes:\nv0 (x) = Wp+q\u22121(x); \u1e7d0 (x) = Wp\u22121(x)\n\n(3.6)\n\nwill have the same evolution after t > t\u0303p+q\u22121 . Even if p \u2192 \u2212\u221e (when modes with very\nsmall scales Lp \u223c \u01eb\u2212p = N p and very large amplitudes ap \u223c a0 (\u01eb(n+1)/2 )p = a0 (N (n+1)/2 )\u2212p )\nare present in the initial perturbation) the multiple merging of the particles will lead to the\nindependence of the evolution of large scale modes with respect to the small scale modes.\nThis effect is similar to the self\u2013preservation of large scale structures in Burgers turbulence [2],[17]. When the initial field v0 (x) is noise, the highly nonlinear structures continuously interact and due to the merging of shocks, their characteristic scale L(t) constantly\nincreases. The presence of small scale noise perturbation vh (x) results in additional fluctuations in the shock coordinates \u2206xk (t), and these fluctuations increase in strength with\nthe passage of time. Thus, the final result of the evolution of the field is determined by the\ncompetition of two factors, the increase in the external scale L(t) of the structures and the\nincrease in the strength \u2206xk (t) of shock coordinates fluctuations, the later being related to\nthe perturbation vh (x). In a turbulence, having power index n < 1 (1.5), multiple merging\nof shocks leads to self-preservation of the large scale structures independently of the presence\n9\n\n\fof small scale components. For the model signal this effect appears for arbitrary n due to\nthe special choice of wavenumbers and phases of interacting modes.\nIt was stressed in the introduction that the solution of Burgers' equation has a one-to-one\ncorrespondence with the dynamics of the gas of inelastically interacting particles ([13]). The\nstage when all light particles collide, forming heavy particles, corresponds to the solution\nof Burgers' equation with a well-defined slope \u2202x v = 1/t. In this case the profile of the\nfield v(x, t) is fully determined by the coordinates and amplitudes of the shocks. Their\ncoordinates Xs (t) are equal to the coordinates of heavy particles, their velocity\ndXs (t)\n= (vs (xs \u2212 0, t) + vs (xs + 0, t))/2\ndt\nis equal to the velocity of the particles, and the amplitude of the shock\nvs (t) =\n\n\u2206vs (x) = (v(xs \u2212 0, t) \u2212 v(xs + 0, t)) = m/t\n\n(3.7)\n\n(3.8)\n\nis determined by the mass of the particle (\u03c10 \u2261 1) (see, e.g., [13]).\nThus, the investigation of the motion of heavy particles permits to fully reconstruct the\nproperties of the velocity field v(x, t) of Burgers' equation.\n\n4\n\nThe sawtooth Weierstrass-Mandelbrot fractal function\n\nIt was shown in the previous section that the evolution of the particles (shocks) is determined by the function Wp (x) (3.1). The basis functions of Wp (x) are the reverse sawtooth\nperiodic functions with wavenumbers kr = k0 \u01ebr and amplitudes ar = a0 \u01eb\u2212hr , h = \u2212(n + 1)/2\nsatisfy relations (1.12). Wavenumbers form a geometrical progression like in the Weierstrass function (see [4]) and accumulate at the origin k = 0. In the original Weierstrass\nfunction, the situation was the opposite with increasing frequencies, but nevertheless the\nfunction Wp (x) has many properties of Weierstrass function and of its generalisation \u2013 the\nWeierstrass-Mandelbrot function (see [21], [4]).\nWe consider here a deterministic function Wp (x) with the special phase relation \u03c6p =\n(2\u03c0k/N)p\n(k = 1, 2, ..., N; N = 1/\u01eb ), thus, the discontinuities in the largest modes\nr > p + 1 coincide with some of the discontinuities of the smaller mode r = p + 1. The\nfunction Wp (x) is continuous in the intervals 2\u03c0/kp+1 = 2\u03c0/(k0\u01ebp+1 ) with the same slope in\neach interval. The inverse value of this slope t\u0303p+1\nt\u0303p+1 = tp+1 (1 \u2212 \u01eb\n\nn+3\n2\n\n); tp+1 = t0 (\u01eb\n\nn+3\n2\n\n)p+1\n\n(4.1)\n\nis proportional to the nonlinear time tp+1 of the smallest mode. Of course, we need n > \u22123,\nso that the convergence of (3.2) is assured and the inequalities tp+1 > tp hold. The amplitudes\nof the modes are proportional to \u01eb(n+1)/2 and for n > \u22121 the function Wp (x) is bounded\nWp (x) \u2264\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nar = a0 (\u01eb\n\nr=p+1\n\n10\n\nn+1\n2\n\n)p+1\n\n1\n1\u2212\u01eb\n\nn+1\n2\n\n.\n\n(4.2)\n\n\fThus, for finite p the energy of Wp (x) is also finite. For the case of the phase relation\nintroduced above, the functions Wp (x) also have scaling properties, so that for instance for\nk = 0, we have\nWp (x) = \u01eb\u2212hp W0 (\u01ebp x); Wp (\u01ebm x) = \u01ebhm Wm+p (x).\n(4.3)\nThe case \u22121 < n < 1 is similar to the initial conditions with generalized white noise\nin Burgers turbulence. The energy of the initial signal in such turbulence is determined by\nthe largest cutoff wavenumber, so in our model by the smallest scale p. If p \u2192 \u2212\u221e the\nenergy of the model signal (as the energy of white noise) will tend to infinity. But from\nthe considerations in the previous section we have that at the finite time t all the modes\nwith tp < t have finite energy \u223c L2p /t2 due to the nonlinear dissipation, so that the whole\nenergy of the turbulence is also finite. Thus, even in the case of \"divergent\" initial conditions\n(p \u2192 \u2212\u221e), we will have a \"convergent\" solution for any time t > 0.\nThe case n < \u22121 is similar to having fractional Brownian motion initial condition in\nBurgers turbulence. In this case, the series (4.2) diverges and the initial signal Wp (x) is\nunbounded. But for Burgers turbulence ( for the process of particles motion and collisions ) only relative velocity of the particles matters. So we can use the same regularisation\nprocedure with Wp (x). Such a procedure was done with the Weierstrass function in [21].\nIn our case, taking \u03c6p \u2261 0, we can introduce the function Wp\u221e (x) = Wp (x) \u2212 Wp (0),\naccording to [21], which is finite in all finite spatial intervals. The other way to get a bounded\nfunction is to use special phase relations for the modes.\n\n5\n\nSelf-similarity properties of deterministic model in\none and two dimension\n\nHere we summarise the properties of the evolution of the multiscale deterministic signal using\nsome additional information about scaling characteristics of Wp (x), and compare them with\nthe properties of the Burgers turbulence.\nLet us consider the evolution of the multiscale signal\nv0 (x) = vp (x) + Wp (x).\n\n(5.1)\n\nIt was shown that at times t for which t > t\u0303p , heavy particles with mass Mp = \u03c10 Lp appear\nand their coordinates are determined by the relation (3.5). These particles collide at time\n(n+3)\nt\u0303p+1 , (t\u0303p+1 /t\u0303p = N 2 , N = \u01eb\u22121 ), and new particles with masses mp+1 = \u03c10 Lp+1 = mp N\nappear. Their motion will be determined by the same law (3.5) with substitution p \u2192 p + 1.\nUsing the scaling properties of Wp (x) (4.3) we have, that the motion of the particles in this\ninterval will be similar to the motion of the particles in the interval [t\u0303p , t\u0303p+1 ] if we rescale\nthe time t/t\u0303p \u21d2 t/t\u0303p+1 . Since the ratio tp+1 /tp does not depend on p, one can speak about\nthe logarithmic periodic self-similarity of the motion of the particles. This means that at\narbitrary interval [t\u0303q , t\u0303q+1 ] the motion of the particles will be similar to the motion of the\nparticles in the interval t\u0303p , t\u0303p+1 , by the scaling factor xp /xq = \u01ebp\u2212q in space, and the scaling\nn+3\nfunction tp /tq = (\u01eb\u2212 2 )p\u2212q in time. The coordinates and masses of the particles fully\n11\n\n\fdetermine the velocity field, and so the solution of Burgers' equation is also logarithmic\nperiodic self\u2013similar.\nWith each collision, the mass M(t) of the particles increases N = 1/\u01eb times. The time\nn+3\ninterval between the two successive collisions increases as tp+1 /tp = N 2 . Thus, by the\napproximation of piecewise constant function m(t) by the power law\nm(t) \u2243 m0 (t/t0 )(n+3)/2 .\n\n(5.2)\n\nwe obtain the same result as for the Burgers turbulence. In our case, m is proportional to\nthe period of the smallest mode at time t, and is analogous to the integral scale in Burgers\nturbulence.\nIn the case n > \u22121 we can also estimate the energy decay of the model signal. For\nn > \u22121 and \u01eb \u226a 1 the main energy of the signal at time t is in the smallest mode and is\nproportional to L2 (t)/t2 . Thus, we have here again the same law for the energy decay as for\nBurgers turbulence.\nThe numerical simulation based on the algorithm [27] was done to illustrate the process of\nparticles merging and velocity field evolution. The trajectories of the particles and profile of\nthe field at different times are plotted for the initial \"white noise\" signal (n = 0, h = \u22121/2)\nin Fig.3, and for the initial \"Brownian\" motion (n = \u22122, h = 1/2) in Fig.4. Ten modes with\nthe ratio of successive wavenumbers \u01eb = 1/N = 1/2 were used. The plots show the initial\nstage of the evolution in some relatively small region where the finiteness of the number of\nmodes is not significant.\nIn Fig. 3 one can see that for n = 0 the initial \"sawtooth\" multiscale function oscillates\nnear v = 0 like a \"white noise\" with finite variance. After the collision of light particles,\nwhen the reverse sawtooth function transforms into a sawtooth wave with positive gradient\n\u2202x v = 1/t, the structure of the signal is relatively simple, and even for N = 2 the main\nenergy remains in the mode with smallest wavenumber.\nIn the case n = \u22122 the initial profile has a large deviation behaviour which is typical for\nBrownian motion functions. After merging of light particles, the sawtooth profile has a set\nof small shocks with different amplitudes, which is also similar to the properties of Brownian\nsignal in the Burgers turbulence [28].\nIn Figs. 3(c) and 4(c) the velocity field at three successive merger times t\u2217 /t\u2217\u2217 = N (n+3)/2\nare plotted. These figures show the logarithmic periodic self-similarity of the evolution of\nmultiscale signals.\nWe notice now that such multiscale waves may be constructed for multidimensional\nBurgers' equation. Let us assume that the initial vector field Vp (x) is an infinite series of\n\"reverse\" modes vr (x):\nVp (x) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nvr (x) ,\n\n(5.3)\n\nr=p\n\nIn the two dimensional case, the rth \"reverse\" mode may be composed of piecewise linear\nfunctions defined on a system of regular triangles of size Lr covering the plane. We consider\nhere the special case when the ratio of the scales of two adjacent modes is Lr+1 /Lr = \u01eb\u22121 =\nN = 2. We assume also the special symmetry and phase relation between the different\nmodes. In our case one big triangle is divided into four smaller triangles with vertices\n12\n\n\flocated at midpoints of its sides ( see Fig.5 ). We assume that inside each triangle in the rth\nmode the velocity has a linear profile vr (x) = \u2212\u03b3r (x \u2212 x+ ), where x+ is the coordinate of\nthe center of the triangle. The solution of the multidimensional Burgers equation for such\ninitial perturbation\n\u2212\u03b3 (x \u2212 x+ )\nv (x, t) =\n(5.4)\n1 \u2212 \u03b3t\nis now valid inside the triangle of size Lr (t) = Lr (1 \u2212 t\u03b3 r ) . The value \u03b3r\u22121 has the dimension\nof time, and at the finite time tr = \u03b3r\u22121 the velocity gradient becomes infinite.\nOn the other hand, at time t = tr , the mode transforms into a \"direct\" sawtooth wave\nwith the universal behaviour inside the new set of triangles and with the gradient 1/t independent of the amplitude and wavenumber of the mode:\nv (x, t) =\n\nx \u2212 xc\n,\nt\n\n(5.5)\n\nwhere xc is now the center of the triangle, coinciding with the top of the initial triangular set.\nConsider now the evolution of a gas of sticky particles in the case of independent evolution\nof the rth mode. Then, it is obvious that at the initial stage, inside the \"collapsing\" triangle\nof size Lr (t) = Lr (1 \u2212 t\u03b3 r ) the density increases as\n\u03c1(x, t) = \u03c10\n\n1\n,\n(1 \u2212 t/tp )2\n\n(5.6)\n\nwhile \u03c1 is zero outside \"collapsing\" triangular in each cell. At time t = tr , all the light\nparticles in each cell collide into a single heavy particle with mass\n\u221a\nmr = \u03c10 L2r 3/4,\n(5.7)\nand the heavy particles' positions are equal to the center of the initial triangle x+ .\nWe assume also that the evolution of the rth mode is characterised by a nonlinear time\ntr the same as in the one dimension case (2.4):\ntr = \u03b3r\u22121 = t0 /(2\u2212(n+3)/2 )r .\n\n(5.8)\n\nLet us now consider the evolution of the vector field Vp (x) (5.3) which is an infinite\nseries of \"reverse\" modes. The evolution of the vector field is very similar to the evolution\nof the scalar field (3.1). For the gradient of the initial perturbation Vp (x) we have the same\nrelation (3.2) as in 1D. The effective time of nonlinearity of the smallest pth mode in the\nvector field (5.3), in presence of all large scale modes, is determined by the equation (3.3).\nThus, after the time of collision t\u0303p , heavy particles with mass mp (5.7) appear. Velocities of\nthese particles will be determined by the function Vp+1 (x) (5.3), which is a sum of all larger\nmodes, but the number of particle collisions is determined by the next p + 1 mode. At time\nt\u0303p+1 we have a collision of four heavy particles.\nThe extrapolation of this particle merger process to next generations is evident by recurrence. The qth collision of heavy particles takes place at time t\u0303p+q ), (5.8) the masses of \u221a\nthese\n2\nparticles at this time are determined by the scale of the (p + q)th mode mp+q = \u03c10 Lp+q 3/4\n13\n\n\f(5.7). Here also one can speak about the logarithmic periodic self-similarity of the motion\nof the particles. This means that at arbitrary interval [t\u0303q , t\u0303q+1 ] the motion of the particles\nwill be similar to the motion of the particles in the interval t\u0303p , t\u0303p+1 , by the scaling factor\nn+3\nxp /xq = 2(q\u2212p) in space, and the scaling function tp /tq = (2 2 )(p\u2212q) in time.\nWe used computer simulation for studying two dimensional case; results of the simulation\nwere generated in so called VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language), which enables to\nhandle three dimensional figure in different projections. Fig. 6 presents snapshots of this\nmodeling. On the Fig. 6(a) one can see that particles formed by small triangles move towards\nthe center of an embracing triangle; this center in its turn, moves towards the center of the\nnext bigger triangle in the hierarchy; e.t.c. Fig.6(b) gives the side-view of this process.\n\n6\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, we would like to point out that the evolution of the multiscale signal with\nthe Weierstrass spectrum simulates properties of Burgers turbulence such as self-similarity,\nconservation of large scale structures and has the same laws of the energy decay and integral\nscale. The difference between the deterministic model and Burgers turbulence is that here\nwe have the exact solution for the evolution of multiscale signals and these properties are not\nstochastic but deterministic. The evolution of the multiscale signal is exactly self-similar in\nlogarithmically spaced time intervals. The evolution of the large scale modes is completely\nindependent of the small scales modes, even if these have very large amplitudes.\nThese properties take place for Burgers turbulence in the stochastical sense and, moreover, for a signal with cutoff frequencies of small scales, only asymptotically. Of course, these\nproperties of the multiscale signal are determined by the special form of modes (reverse sawtooth function), the special relations between wavenumbers of modes (kr+1 = kr /N, where\nN is an integer) and their phase relations.\nOn the other hand, these model signals do not reflect such properties of Burgers turbulence as qualitative difference in the behaviour of the turbulence for n < 1 and n > 1 in\nthe power spectrum (1.9) due to the process of generation of large scale components in the\nspectrum. For the deterministic model this process is not present due to the special relation\nof wavenumbers.\nLet as now move to the mechanical interpretation of solution of the Burgers equation.\nFor the initial reverse sawtooth wave, all the matter turns into heavy particles at the same\nmoment of time. Thus, after this time, the evolution of Burgers turbulence is fully determined by the motion of heavy particles. The trajectories of heavy particles form regular\ntree-like structure on the plane (X, t), see Figs. 3 and 4. The properties of this structure\ndepend on the parameters of our model. The integer \u01eb\u22121 = N is the number of trajectories\nwhich intersect at one point and form a new branch of our structure. For \u01eb\u22121 = N = 2 we,\nthus, obtain binary tree structure. Changing of the parameter h stretches or contracts the\nstructure in the t direction. One can say that our structure is the plane representation of\nthe N\u2212tree; the root of our tree is located at t = +\u221e. This tree is similar to the flattened\nfractal model of botanical umbrella tree (see [21]). If we take some node (X, T ) of this\n14\n\n\fstructure as a root, and consider the trajectories of all heavy particles, which will merge\nat the moment of time T at this point (X, T ) we shall also obtain an n-tree. The whole\ntree seems self-similar, because every branch plus the branches it carries is a reduced scale\nversion of the whole.\nWe also notice that such multiscale waves may be constructed for multidimensional\nBurgers' equation.\n\n7\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors are grateful to U.
