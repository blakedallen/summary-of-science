Belov, Yan Zhao, Sunil Sudhakaran, Akram Alomainy, and Yang Hao\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0610558v1 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 19 Oct 2006\n\nDepartment of Electronic Engineering, Queen Mary University of London,\nMile End Road, London, E1 4NS, United Kingdom\nAn experimental investigation of sub-wavelength imaging by a wire medium slab is performed. A\ncomplex-shaped near field source is used in order to test imaging performance of the device. It is\ndemonstrated that the ultimate bandwidth of operation of the constructed imaging device is 4.5%\nthat coincides with theoretical predictions [Phys. Rev. E 73, 056607 (2006)]. Within this band the\nwire medium slab is capable of transmitting images with \u03bb/15 resolution irrespectively of the shape\nand complexity of the source. Actual bandwidth of operation for particular near-field sources can\nbe larger than the ultimate value but it strongly depends on the configuration of the source.\nPACS numbers: 78.20.Ci, 42.70.Qs, 42.25.Fx, 73.20.Mf\n\nAn original concept of imaging with resolution smaller\nthan the wavelength (sub-wavelength imaging) has been\nrecently proposed in [1]. It has been demonstrated that a\nregular array of parallel conducting wires (see Fig. 1(a))\nis capable of transporting images with sub-wavelength\ndetails from one planar interface to another. The principle of operation of this device (see [2]) is based on the\nidea of transforming the whole spatial spectrum of the\nsub-wavelength source to the propagating modes inside\nof a metamaterial formed by the array of wires, also called\nas the wire medium [3]. In such a way, the evanescent\nwaves which carry sub-wavelength information and normally decay in free space can be transformed into the\npropagating modes inside of the wire medium and transported to significant distances.\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) The geometries of the transmission\ndevice (a), an 21 \u00d7 21 array of wires with 1 mm radii, and the\nnear-field source (b). All dimensions are in millimeters.\n\nThe initial experimental investigation of the subwavelength imaging capability of the wire medium slab\nhas been performed recently in [1]. The antenna in the\nform of letter 'P' was used as a sub-wavelength source.\nThe clear images of the source were detected at the back\ninterface of the transmission device and resolution of\n\u03bb/15 was demonstrated for 18% operation bandwidth.\nThe extensive theoretical studies [4] based on analysis of\ntransmission and reflection coefficient predicts that the\n\nsub-wavelength imaging should be observed for at least\n4.5% bandwidth for any kind of the source. However, in\npractice, for certain sources the imaging can be observed\nwithin larger frequency bandwidths. The complexity of\nthe near field produced by the source and the interaction between the source and the transmission device play\ncrucial roles in determining the imaging performance of\nthe whole system. At the frequencies outside of the theoretical minimum band of operation the strong reflections\nfrom the wire medium slab are expected in accordance\nto [4]. That is why the sensitivity of the source with respect to external fields becomes an issue. If the source is\nvery complex and contains a lot of sub-wavelength details\nthen its near field distribution can be easily deformed by\nharmful reflections from the interface of the transmission device and no proper sub-wavelength imaging can\nbe observed at the frequencies outside of the theoretical\nminimum band of operation. However, if the source is\nsimple and does not contain many sub-wavelength details then the source is immune from reflections and the\nimage can be successfully transported to the back interface even at some frequencies outside of the minimum\nband of operation, as it was observed in [1], for example.\nIn order to investigate the imaging capability of the\nwire medium slab in details we have performed an experiment with the meander-line antenna printed on 2 mm\nthick slab of duroid with relative permittivity \u03b5 = 2.33\n(see Fig. 1(b) for other dimensions), which intentionally\nhas much more complex near-field distribution as compared to the 'P' antenna used in [1], see Fig. 2. The\nreturn loss (S11 parameter) within the frequency band\nfrom 840 MHz to 1060MHz for the meander-line antenna\nin the free space was compared with the return loss of the\nsame antenna but placed close to the front interface of the\nwire medium slab, see Fig. 1(a). The results of the comparison are presented in Fig. 3 and clearly demonstrate\nthat the wire medium slab does not affect the meanderline antenna at the frequency band from 915 MHz to 955\nMHz, see the shaded area in Fig. 3. It means that within\n915-955 MHz frequency range the meander-line antenna\npractically does not suffer from reflections from the wire\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Results of the near field scan at 850 MHz, 880 MHz, 940 MHz and 1 GHz (in arbitrary units): the\namplitude of the component of electric field normal to the interface at 2 mm distance from the meander antenna in the free\nspace (source plane without wire medium), the same but when the antenna is placed at the front interface of the transmission\ndevice (source plane with wire medium) and at 2 mm distance from the back interface of the wire medium slab (image plane).\n\nmedium slab. The slab is practically transparent at these\nfrequencies and this fact was predicted theoretically in\n[4] where unprecedentedly small values of reflection coefficient for all angles of incidence including evanescent\nwaves have been demonstrated.\nThe near field scan has been performed for the frequencies within 840-1060 MHz frequency band which is\nsignificantly wider than the band of 915-955 MHz where\nperfect imaging is expected in order to verify general behavior of the imaging system. We used an automatic\nmechanical near-field scanning device and a 2 mm long\nmonopole probe made from the central core of a coaxial\ncable with 2 mm diameter. The scan area was 24 \u00d7 24\ncm2 with 75 steps in both directions. The probe was ori-\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) The return loss (S11 parameter) as\nfunction of frequency for the meander-line antenna in the free\nspace and at the interface of the wire medium slab.\n\nented normally with respect to the interfaces of both the\nmeander antenna and the transmission device. So, it detected only the normal component of electrical field. The\nwire medium slab is capable of imaging only the electromagnetic waves with TM (transverse magnetic) polarization [1] and only the normal component of electric field\nis completely restored at the back interface. The other\ntwo components contain contribution of electromagnetic\nwaves with TE (transverse electric) polarization, which\nare not transferred by the wire medium slab.\nThe slab of wire medium is a transmission device, not\na usual lens. It transports electric field from its front\ninterface to the back interface and does not involve any\nfocusing effects. The electric field at 2 mm distance from\nthe front interface of the meander-line antenna located in\nfree space (without the wire medium) was scanned and\nregarded as the source field. After that the meanderline antenna was placed at the front interface of the wire\nmedium slab and the field at 2 mm distance from the\nfront interface of the antenna was scanned once gain.\nThis allows us to detect the difference between the field\ncreated by antenna with and without the presence of wire\nmedium. The image field was scanned at 2 mm distance\naway from the back interface of the slab in order to avoid\ntouching of the probe and the transmission device. Results of the near-field scan at 23 frequencies from 840\nMHz to 1060 MHz with 10 MHz step are presented in\nthe multimedia file [5]. The same results, but only for\n850 MHz, 880 MHz, 940 MHz and 1 GHz are shown in\nFig. 2. At 910-960 MHz the fields at the source plane with\n\n\f3\nand without presence of antenna are practically identical\n(see [5] or Fig. 2 for result at 940 MHz). This confirms\nthat the wire medium slab practically does not introduce\nreflections at theses frequencies. At the same time the\nfield in the image plane repeats the source field with accuracy about 2 cm. This confirms that the resolution of\nthe imaging device at this frequencies is about \u03bb/15.\nAt frequencies lower than 920 MHz (up to 870 MHz)\nthe fields in the source plane with and without wire\nmedium slab remain practically identical. However, the\nimage is distorted by sharp maxima (see [5] or Fig. 2 for\nresult at 880 MHz). These maxima are caused by surface\nwaves excited at the interfaces of the wire medium and\nwere predicted theoretically in [4]. We can say that at\nthese frequencies the transmission device maintains the\ncapability of sub-wavelength imaging, but with reduced\nresolution. At frequencies lower than 870 MHz the surface waves completely degrade the image and simultaneously provide strong reflections which make distribution\nin the source and image planes different.\nAt frequencies higher than 960 MHz the imaging performance of the transmission device also degrades, but\nthis happens because of other reasons. At 970 MHz the\ndistributions at the source plane with and without wire\nmedium already become significantly different. It can\nbe explained by strong reflections from the slab which\nchange distribution of currents in the antenna. In this\ncase reflections are much more prominent than those at\nlower frequencies and are caused by the fact that the\nslab does not fulfill the Fabry-Perot resonance condition\nanymore. Following the theoretical studies [4], at lower\nfrequencies the reflection coefficient is large only for spatial harmonics with wave vectors close to the wave vector\nof the surface wave. That is why while the wave vector\nof the surface wave is large (870-920 MHz) we observe\nonly sharp maxima in the image plane and no significant changes between fields in the source plane with and\nwithout wire medium. As the wave vector of the surface\nwave decreases (< 870 MHz) the reflections experienced\nby the antenna from the wire medium increase and completely destroy the imaging. In the case of high frequencies (> 960 MHz) there are no surface waves, but the\nreflection increases and this increase happens simultaneously for all spatial harmonics. That is why we observe\nstrong difference between fields in the source plane with\nand without wire medium at these frequencies. However, it is interesting to note that the distributions in\nthe source and image planes of the transmission device\nremain practically identical (see [5] or Fig. 2 for result\nat 970 MHz and 1 GHz). The difference is practically\nnegligible at 960-1060 MHz. The resolution remains the\nsame (2 cm, about \u03bb/15) as at lower frequencies. Following the theoretical predictions [4] the resolution should\nslightly degrade with an increase of frequency, however,\nwithin the tested frequency range we were not able to\ndetect any significant degradation of resolution.\n\nThus, we can conclude that the wire medium slab has\ngood sub-wavelength imaging properties even at frequencies higher than the frequency of Fabry-Perot resonance,\nbut the large level of reflections from the wire medium\nslab is an issue. If the sub-wavelength source is sensitive to external field (for example, the meander-line antenna whose current distribution changes in an external\nfield), then the wire medium slab can not be used for its\nimaging. However, if the source field is not sensitive to\nexternal fields (for example, an array of small antennas\nfed by fixed current sources), then it remains unaffected\nby reflections from the transmission device and the wire\nmedium slab can be successfully used for imaging of this\nsource with very good sub-wavelength resolution. The\nantenna in the form of P-letter used in [1] is insensitive\nto reflections from the wire medium slab and that is why\nthe sub-wavelength imaging with \u03bb/15 resolution was reported in [1] for the range from 920 MHz to 1.1 GHz.\nIn conclusion, in this letter the minimum operation bandwidth of the wire medium slab as the subwavelength imaging device, theoretically predicted in [4],\nwas confirmed experimentally. We would like to stress\nthat the actual bandwidth of operation significantly depends on the complexity and sensitivity of the source to\nreflections from the wire medium slab. For sources which\nare not sensitive to external fields the sub-wavelength\nimaging can be performed within significantly wide frequency range. However, for an arbitrary source the imaging can be guaranteed only within the minimum bandwidth. We would like to remind [1, 4] that the wire\nmedium slabs are able to transmit images to any long\ndistances specified by particular application. The only\nrestriction is that the length of the transmission device\nshould be equal to an integer number of half-wavelengths\nin order to fulfill Fabry-Perot condition and eliminate unwanted reflections. The resolution of the wire medium\nslab is ultimately defined by its period. That is why in\nthe microwave frequency range practically any fine subwavelength resolution can be obtained if the wire medium\nwith the sufficiently small period can be manufactured.\n\n[1] P. A.
