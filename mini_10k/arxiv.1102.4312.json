Introduction\nThe representation of natural numbers as sums of integer squares has been\na problem studied by number theorists for centuries [9,10, 11, 22, 29]. Of particular\ninterest are the cases in which the natural numbers represented in this way are\nprime. Fermat was the first to indicate that for an odd prime p,\n(1.1)\n\np = a 2 + b 2 , a , b \u2208N \u21d4 p \u2261 1 (mod 4) ,\n\nas eventually proved by Euler [9, 11]. Similarly, Fermat showed that\n(1.2)\n\np = a 2 + 2 b 2 , a , b \u2208N \u21d4 p \u2261 1 , 3 (mod 8) ,\n\n(1.3)\n\np = a 2 + 3 b 2, a , b \u2208N \u21d4 p = 3 or p \u2261 1 (mod 3) ,\n\nand again Euler provided proofs for both statements [9, 11]. The consequent\ndevelopment of quadratic reciprocity and the theory of quadratic forms extended\nthese initial results considerably [9, 10, 13, 22]. Further progress was achieved with\nthe advent of higher reciprocity, class field theory and complex multiplication\n[9, 11, 18, 27], as well as many other aspects of algebraic and analytical number\ntheory [4, 21, 30].\n\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

PEREZ\n\nEquation (1.1) merits particular attention because of its direct association with\nthe Pythagorean equation x 2 + y 2 = z 2. It can be said that, for primes p \u2261 1 (mod 4),\nthere are integers a and b such that\n(1.4)\n\n(2 a b) 2 + (a 2 \u2013 b 2) 2 = (a 2 + b 2) 2 = p 2 ,\n\ntherefore making p the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides a 2 \u2013 b 2, 2 a b, and\np [7, 20, 30]. Fermat called (1.4) \"the fundamental theorem on right triangles\" [30],\nclearly giving some importance to the geometric interpretation of (1.1).\nThese observations suggest that other groups of primes, represented by\nalternative binary quadratic forms, could also be geometrically expressed within\nPythagorean triangles. This article describes such findings.\n2. Primitive Pythagorean triples\nAny set of integers x , y , z \u2208N, that satisfy the Pythagorean equation x 2 + y 2 = z 2 ,\nis defined as a Pythagorean triple. Furthermore, the triple is said to be primitive\nif gcd (x , y , z) = 1 [7]. All the primitive triples can be generated by the well-known\nparametrization\n(2.1)\n\nx = 2ab\n\ny = a2 \u2013 b2\n\nz = a2 + b2\n\nfor integers a , b \u2208N, such that a > b > 0, gcd (a , b) = 1, and a \u2261 b (mod 2) [7, 20, 29].\nThis can be used to define a primitive Pythagorean triangle as any right triangle\nwhose sides are of integral length and relatively prime (see Figure 1). It is a\ngeometric property of all Pythagorean triangles that the radius r of their inscribed\ncircle is always an integer [7, 19]. Using the parametrization (2.1), it is simple to\ndeduce that the value of r for a primitive Pythagorean triangle is given by\nr = b \u22c5 (a \u2013 b) .\n\n(2.2)\n\nThis can be derived from a classical observation that relates the two sides x , y and\nthe hypotenuse z of a right triangle to the radius r of its inscribed circle [19],\n(2.3)\n\nz = x + y \u2013 2r ,\n\nx = 2ab\ny = a2 \u2013 b2\nz = a2 + b 2\nr = b * (a \u2013 b)\n\nr\n\nx\n\nr\n\nr\n\ny\n\nr\n\nx-r\n\ny-r\nr\nx-r\n\nz\n\ny-r\n\nz = x \u2013 r + y \u2013 r = x + y \u2013 2r\nFigure 1. The parametrization of primitive Pythagorean triangles.\n\n\fTHE TRIANGULAR THEOREM OF THE PRIMES\n\n3\n\nas easily deduced from Figure 1. The parametrization (2.1) and the relation (2.3)\nreadily combine to deliver (2.2):\n2r = x + y \u2013 z = 2 a b + (a 2 \u2013 b 2) \u2013 (a 2 + b 2) = 2 a b \u2013 2b 2 = 2b \u22c5 (a \u2013 b) .\nThe geometric and/or algebraic observations described by (2.1) \u2013 (2.3) can be\nextended further. As illustrated in Figure 2, the parametrization (2.1) can be used\nto deduce that:\na) the sum of the two sides x , y can be expressed as a binary quadratic form, i.e.\n(2.4)\n\nx + y = 2 a b + (a 2 \u2013 b 2) = a 2 + 2 a b \u2013 b 2 = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2b 2 ;\n\nb) as established by (2.3) [19] , the substraction of two radii from the sum of the\ntwo sides x , y renders the hypothenuse z , expressed as a sum of two squares,\nx \u2013 r = 2 a b \u2013 b \u22c5 (a \u2013 b) = a b + b 2 ,\ny \u2013 r = a 2 \u2013 b 2 \u2013 b \u22c5 (a \u2013 b) = a 2 \u2013 a b ,\n(2.5)\n\nx + y \u2013 2r = z = a 2 + b 2 ;\n\na)\nx\n\ny\n\nz\n2\n\n2\n\nx + y = (a + b) \u2013 2b\nb)\nr\n\nr\n\nx\u2013r\n\ny\u2013r\n\nz\n2\n\nx + y \u2013 2r = z = a + b\n\n2\n\nc)\nr\n\nx \u2013 2r\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\ny \u2013 2r\n\nz\n2\n\nx + y \u2013 4r = (a \u2013 b) + 2b\n\n2\n\nFigure 2. Binary quadratic forms in primitive Pythagorean triangles.\n\n\f4\n\nJ. A. PEREZ\n\nc) the substraction of four radii from the sum of the two sides x , y generates\nanother binary quadratic form,\nx \u2013 2r = 2 a b \u2013 2b \u22c5 (a \u2013 b) = 2b 2 ,\ny \u2013 2r = a \u2013 b 2 \u2013 2b \u22c5 (a \u2013 b) = a 2 \u2013 2 a b + b 2 = (a \u2013 b) 2 ,\n2\n\n(2.6)\n\nx + y \u2013 4r = (a \u2013 b) 2 + 2b 2 .\n\nHence, equations (2.4) \u2013 (2.6) represent three distinct binary quadratic forms that\nare all naturally associated with the geometry of primitive Pythagorean triangles\n(Figure 2).\n3. Binary quadratic forms\nThe geometric role that the three binary quadratic forms (2.4) \u2013 (2.6) clearly\ndisplay in all primitive Pythagorean triangles (Figure 2) prompts a detailed\ncharacterization of the integers represented by these forms, within the context of\nthe parametrization (2.1).\n3.1. x + y \u2013 2r = z = a 2 + b 2. As indicated in (1.4), the hypotenuse z = a 2 + b 2 of\na primitive Pythagorean triangle can be seen as representing, for some value\nof a and b, an odd prime p \u2261 1 (mod 4). A more complete statement is to affirm\nthat any integer N \u2208N , represented by the sum of two squares, N = a 2 + b 2, such\nthat a , b \u2208N , a > b > 0, a \u2261 b (mod 2) and gcd (a , b) = 1, can only be divided evenly\nby factors that are also written as sums of two squares. When these factors are\nprime, they are of the form p \u2261 1 (mod 4) [7, 10, 11]. Requiring a and b to have\nopposite parities, a \u2261 b (mod 2), makes N \u2261 1 (mod 2), thus excluding even divisors.\nConsequently, it can be established that the hypotenuses of the set of all primitive\nPythagorean triangles, as previously defined, represent all possible integers N\nwhose factorizations include only primes of the form p \u2261 1 (mod 4). Hence, define\nthe set of integers\n\n{\n\n(3.1)\nwhere\n\nn\n\n\u220f\n\nj=1\n\nn\n\nS1,5 := N1,5 = \u220f pjkj = a 2 + b 2 , a , b \u2208N , a > b > 0,\nj=1\ngcd (a , b) = 1, a \u2261 b (mod 2), pj \u2261 1,5 (mod 8) ,\npjkj\n\n}\n\nis the prime canonical factorization of N1,5 .\n\nSince pj \u2261 1 (mod 4) \u2261 1,5 (mod 8), it is always the case that N1,5 \u2261 1,5 (mod 8), and\nthis explains the nomenclature used in (3.1). That all possible integers N1,5 , as\ndefined in (3.1), can be written as sums of two squares, and that at least one of\nsuch representations is primitive, are the consequence of three established facts.\nFirst, the well-known identity\n(3.2)\n\n(a 2 + b 2) (c 2 + d 2) = (ac \ue037 bd) 2 + (ad \ue036 bc) 2\n\nimplies that, if two numbers are sums of two squares, then their product is also\na sum of two squares [9, 11, 22]. Secondly, as originally proved by Euler using an\ninfinite descent, when a and b are relatively prime, every factor of N1,5 = a 2 + b 2 is\nn\n\nitself a sum of two squares [9, 11]. Thirdly, for any integer N1,5 = \u220f pjkj, such that\nj=1\n\npj \u2261 1,5 (mod 8), the total number of proper (primitive) representations as a sum\n\n\fTHE TRIANGULAR THEOREM OF THE PRIMES\n\n5\n\nof two squares is given by 2n \u20131, where n is the number of distinct odd prime\ndivisors of N1,5 (see, for example Section 8 of chapter VI in [10]; also [22]). As\nindependently proved [7, 22], when N1,5 = pj = a 2 + b 2, the primitive representation\nis therefore unique. Accordingly, the number of primitive Pythagorean triangles\nwhose hypotenuse represent an integer of S1,5 is dependent on the factorization\nof N1,5 .\n3.2. x + y = a 2 + 2 a b \u2013 b 2 = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2b 2. Equation (2.4) indicates that the sum of\nthe two sides of a primitive Pythagorean triangle can be represented by a binary\nquadratic form, in a way that parallels the case of the hypotenuse z = a 2 + b 2.\nThis new form F (a , b) = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2b 2 can be found to be equivalent to another\nform G (a', b' ) according to\n(3.3)\n\nx + y = a 2 + 2 a b \u2013 b 2 = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2b 2 = a' 2 \u2013 2b' 2 ,\n\nthat results from the transformation\nM = \uf8eb 1 0\uf8f6 , which induces the change (a + b, b) \u2192 (a , b) .\n\uf8ed \u20131 1\uf8f8\nThe transformation matrix M has determinant det (M) = +1; this implies that M is\nunimodular and justifies the equivalence F ~ G [27, 30].\nThe equivalence F ~ G proves useful when trying to determine what integers\ncan be represented by F (a , b) = a 2 + 2 a b \u2013 b 2 = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2b 2. As is well-documented\nin the literature (see [4, 10, 11]; also exercise 2.23 in [9]), all primes p \u2261 1,7 (mod 8)\ncan be represented by the quadratic form G (a', b' ) = a' 2 \u2013 2b' 2. Therefore, by making\nuse of (2.4), it is possible to establish that these primes could, in principle, be\nrepresented by p = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2b 2 = x + y , where x and y are the sides of a primitive\nPythagorean triangle. It is trivial to see that, for G (a', b' ) = a' 2 \u2013 2b' 2 to represent\nan odd prime, as well as requiring gcd (a', b' ) = 1, it is necessary that a' \u2261 1 (mod 2).\nSince it is always true for any primitive Pythagorean triangle that gcd (a , b) = 1, and\na \u2261 b (mod 2), it is elementary to establish that gcd (a + b , b) = 1 and a + b \u2261 1 (mod 2),\nthus confirming that the form F (a , b) = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2b 2 is capable of representing\nodd primes.\nIt should be pointed out that the discriminant of the forms F and G is positive\n(\ue044 = 8), and that makes them indefinite. This would imply that, in principle, they\ncould take both positive and negative values [10, 22, 27]. However, the possibility\nof negative values is eliminated by the condition a > b > 0, as required by the\nparametrization (2.1) [7, 20, 29]. Consequently, the general principles of the theory\nof quadratic forms, as applicable to positive definite binary forms [10, 27], should\nalso be applicable to the forms F and G, as described in (3.3), provided that\na > b > 0. The crucial role played by this condition is illustrated by the fact that\nthe quadratic form G (a', b' ) = a' 2 \u2013 2b' 2, which does not impose any restrictions\non the relative values of a' and b', generates infinite representations for primes\np \u2261 1,7 (mod 8) [22, 27]. As example, take the four smallest primes p \u2261 1,7 (mod 8),\nand examine their first five representations, i.e. those using the smallest possible\n(positive) values for a and b:\n7 = (2 + 1) 2 \u2013 2\u221912 = (2 + 3) 2 \u2013 2\u221932 = (4 + 9) 2 \u2013 2\u221992 = (8 + 19) 2 \u2013 2\u2219192 = (22 + 53) 2 \u2013 2\u2219532\n\n\f6\n\nJ. A. PEREZ\n\n17 = (3 + 2) 2 \u2013 2\u221922 = (3 + 4) 2 \u2013 2\u221942 = (7 + 16) 2 \u2013 2\u2219162 = (11 + 26) 2 \u2013 2\u2219262 = (39 + 94) 2 \u2013 2\u2219942\n23 = (4 + 1) 2 \u2013 2\u221912 = (4 + 7) 2 \u2013 2\u221972 = (6 + 13) 2 \u2013 2\u2219132 = (18 + 43) 2 \u2013 2\u2219432 = (32 + 77) 2 \u2013 2\u2219772\n31 = (4 + 3) 2 \u2013 2\u221932 = (4 + 5) 2 \u2013 2\u221952 = (10 + 23) 2 \u2013 2\u2219232 = (14 + 33) 2 \u2013 2\u2219332 = (56 + 135) 2 \u2013 2\u22191352\nIn all four cases, the first representation is the only one that meets the condition\na > b. This observation might be taken to suggest two things: i) first, all primes\np \u2261 1,7 (mod 8), expressed by the form F (a , b) = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2b 2, have at least one\nrepresentation where a > b > 0; ii) secondly, such a representation is unique. The\nfollowing two theorems provide the proofs.\nTheorem 3.1. Any prime number p \u2261 1,7 (mod 8), expressed by the quadratic form\nF (a , b) = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2b 2, where a , b \u2208N , a \u2261 b (mod 2) and gcd (a , b) = 1 , has at least one\nrepresentation where a > b > 0 .\nProof. By contradiction. In order to reach this conclusion, assume the opposite\nis true, i.e. that for all infinite representations of p \u2261 1,7 (mod 8) using the binary\nquadratic form F (a , b) = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2b 2, b > a whenever b > 0 .\nAs a preliminary fact, it is important to verify that, when b > 0 , it is also true that\na > 0 . Since p = F (a , b) > 0 , it is the case that (a + b) 2 > 2b 2, which in turn means\nthat |a + b| > + 2 b. Consequently, for a fixed value of b , there will always be two\npossible values of a. Considering the first possibility, a1 + b > 0, the implication is\nthat a1 + b > 2 b, and a1 > ( 2 \u2013 1) b > 0, as required. The second possibility, a2 + b < 0,\nimplies that a2 < 0, since a2 + b = \u2013 (a1 + b) and\n(3.4)\n\na2 = \u2013 (a1 + 2b) < 0 .\n\nIt is also important to observe that, in all cases, a \u2260 b. This can be deduced by\ncontradiction since, if a = b , then\n(3.5)\n\nF (a , b) = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2b 2 = (2a) 2 \u2013 2a 2 = 2a 2 ,\n\nwhich is incompatible with p being an odd prime, p \u2261 1 (mod 2).\nApplying the Well-Ordering Principle [7] to the infinite set of representations\nof p = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2b 2 , where b > 0 , consider the representation with the smallest\npossible value of b: p = (a1 + b1) 2 \u2013 2b1 2, where b1 > a1 , according to the starting\nassumption. Consider also a second representation of the set p = (c1 + d1) 2 \u2013 2d1 2,\nsuch that c1 = a1 . Therefore,\n(3.6)\n\np = (a1 + b1) 2 \u2013 2b1 2 = (c1 + d1) 2 \u2013 2d1 2 = (a1 + d1) 2 \u2013 2d1 2 ,\n\nand\na1 2 + 2a1b1 \u2013 b1 2 = a1 2 + 2a1d1 \u2013 d1 2 ,\n2a1 (b1 \u2013 d1) = b1 2 \u2013 d1 2 = (b1 + d1) (b1 \u2013 d1) ,\n(3.7)\n\nd1 = 2a1 \u2013 b1 .\n\nThe simplification leading to equation (3.7) can only be legitimately obtained if\nd1 \u2260 b1 , but this is also compatible with a1 \u2260 b1 , as required to avoid (3.5). The\nimplication is that condition c1 = a1 can always be satisfied, i.e. p always has two\nrepresentations with identical values c1 = a1 but different values d1 \u2260 b1. As given\n\n\fTHE TRIANGULAR THEOREM OF THE PRIMES\n\n7\n\nby (3.7), all three possibilities regarding value and sign of d1 must be considered:\n(1) d1 = 2a1 \u2013 b1 = 0\nThis possibility is incompatible with p being prime, since it implies that\np = (c1 + d1) 2 \u2013 2d12 = c12 is a perfect square.\n(2) d1 = 2a1 \u2013 b1 > 0\nAs initially assumed, b1> a1 . Therefore, d1 = 2a1 \u2013 b1 = a1 + (a1 \u2013 b1) < a1 and\nd1< c1 , hence contradicting the original assumption.\n(3) d1 = 2a1 \u2013 b1 < 0\nIt can then be stated that b1 \u2013 2a1 > 0. Accordingly,\n(3.8)\n\np = (c1 + d1) 2 \u2013 2d12 = [a1 + (2a1 \u2013 b1)] 2 \u2013 2 (2a1 \u2013 b1) 2 = [a1 \u2013 (b1 \u2013 2a1)] 2 \u2013 2 (b1 \u2013 2a1) 2\np = [a1 \u2013 2 (b1 \u2013 2a1) + (b1 \u2013 2a1)] 2 \u2013 2 (b1 \u2013 2a1) 2 = (c2 + d2) 2 \u2013 2d2 2 ,\nwhere the new representation has parameters\n\n(3.9)\n\nc2 = a1 \u2013 2 (b1 \u2013 2a1) = 5a1 \u2013 2b1 ,\nd2 = b1 \u2013 2a1 > 0 .\nIt is important to determine the sign of c2 . The application of (3.4) to (3.9)\nimplies that, for a fixed d2 , the alternative to c2 takes the value\n\n(3.10)\n\n\u2013 (c2 + 2d2 ) = \u2013 (5a1 \u2013 2b1 + 2b1 \u2013 4 a1 ) = \u2013 a1 < 0 .\nTherefore, it can be concluded that c2 = 5a1 \u2013 2b1 > 0 . Since b1 > 2a1 , it can\nalso be deduced that\n\n(3.11)\n\nc2 = 5a1 \u2013 2b1 < 5a1 \u2013 2 (2a1) = a1 ,\nd2 = b1 \u2013 2a1 < b1 .\nAs shown before, c2 \u2260 d2 ; hence, there are two possibilities:\n(a) c2 > d2 , contradicting the original assumption.\n(b) c2 < d2 , contradicting that the representation with a1 and b1 has the\nsmallest possible value of b, while b1 < a1.\n\nThe overall conclusion is finally reached that for each prime p \u2261 1,7 (mod 8) there\nis at least one representation p = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2b 2 where a > b > 0 .\n\u00a3\n\uf057\nIn the proof of the next theorem, use is made of the well-known formula [9, 11]\n(3.12)\n\n(a 2 + k b 2) (c 2 + k d 2) = (a c \ue037 k b d) 2 + k (a d \ue036 b c) 2 ,\n\nk = \ue0361, 2, 3, ...\n\nthat, when making k = \u2013 2 and adopting forms like F (a , b) , leads to the following\nlemma.\nLemma 3.2. Consider two integers, p and q (prime or not), expressed by the\nbinary quadratic form F (a , b) = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2b 2:\n(3.13)\n\np = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2b 2\n\nq = (c + d) 2 \u2013 2d 2\n\nTheir product N = p\u2219 q will be equally expressed by the form F (a , b) = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2b 2 ,\naccording to\n\n\f8\n\nJ.

Combining (3.12) and (3.13), it can be written that\n(3.16)\n\np\u2219 q = [(a+b) 2 \u2013 2 b 2] [(c+d) 2 \u2013 2 d 2] = [(a+b) (c+d )+2 b d] 2 \u2013 2 [b (c+d )+(a+b) d] 2\np\u2219 q = [(a+b) 2 \u2013 2 b 2] [(c+d) 2 \u2013 2 d 2] = [(a+b) (c+d ) \u2013 2 b d] 2 \u2013 2 [b (c+d ) \u2013 (a+b) d] 2 .\n\nBy making use of (3.14), the different terms in (3.16) can be expanded as follows:\nB = b (c+d ) + d (a+b ) = b c + a d + 2 b d\nA + B =(a+b) (c+d ) + 2 b d = a c +b d + ( b c + a d + 2 b d ) = a c +b d + B\nA = a c +b d\nand\nD = b (c+d ) \u2013 d (a+b ) = b c + b d \u2013 a d \u2013 b d = b c \u2013 a d\nC + D = (a+b) (c+d ) \u2013 2 b d = a (c+d ) +b c \u2013 b d = a (c+d ) + b c \u2013 b d \ue036 a d\nC + D = a (c+d ) + a d \u2013 b d + ( b c \u2013 a d ) = a (c+d )+ d (a \u2013 b) + D\nC = a (c+d ) + d (a \u2013 b )\nthus confirming the expressions given by (3.15).\n\n\u00a3\n\nTheorem 3.3. The representation of a prime number p \u2261 1,7 (mod 8) by the binary\nquadratic form F (a , b) = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2 b 2, where a , b \u2208N , a \u2261 b (mod 2) and gcd (a , b) = 1 ,\nis always unique, provided that a > b > 0 .\nProof. By contradiction. To establish that the representation is unique, suppose\nthe opposite is true, that is\n(3.17)\n\np = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2 b 2 = (c + d) 2 \u2013 2 d 2 ,\n\nwhere a, b, c, d are all positive integers that satisfy the conditions a > b and c > d .\nUsing (3.17), it can be established that\np [(a+b) 2 \u2013 (c+d) 2] = (a + b) 2 [(c+d) 2 \u2013 2 d 2] \u2013 (c + d) 2 [(a+b) 2 \u2013 2 b 2]\n(3.18)\n\np [(a+b) 2 \u2013 (c+d) 2] = 2 [b 2 (c+d) 2 \u2013 (a+b) 2 d 2] .\n\nSince p is an odd prime, (3.18) implies that\n(3.19)\n\n[b (c+d)+(a+b) d] [b (c+d) \u2013 (a+b) d] \u2261 0 (mod p) .\n\nTherefore, the existence of at least two representations implies compliance with\ncongruence (3.19), which in turn requires that, either b (c+d) + (a+b) d \u2261 0 (mod p) , or\nb (c+d) \u2013 (a+b) d \u2261 0 (mod p) . The two possibilities need to be analysed separately.\n(1) b (c+d) + (a+b) d \u2261 0 (mod p)\nSince b (c+d) + (a+b) d > 0 , the above congruence implies that there is\na positive integer k such that\n(3.20)\n\nb (c+d) + (a+b) d = k p .\n(3.16), (3.17) and (3.20) can be combined to deduce that\n\n\fTHE TRIANGULAR THEOREM OF THE PRIMES\n\n9\n\np 2 = [(a+b) 2 \u2013 2 b 2] [(c+d) 2 \u2013 2 d 2] = [(a+b) (c+d )+2 b d] 2 \u2013 2 [b (c+d )+(a+b) d] 2\np 2 = (a c+a d+b c+b d+2 b d) 2 \u2013 2 k 2 p 2 = [a c+b d+b (c+d )+(a+b) d] 2 \u2013 2 k 2 p 2\np 2 = (a c+b d+k p) 2 \u2013 2 k 2 p 2 ,\nthus obtaining\n(3.21)\n\np 2 (1+ 2 k 2) = (a c+b d+k p) 2 .\nThe analysis of equation (3.21) requires evaluation of a c+b d in relation\nto p . From the initial conditions a > b and c > d , it can be inferred that\nb \u2264 a \u2013 1 and d \u2264 c \u2013 1 for all possible cases. Therefore,\n\n(3.22)\n\na c+b d \u2264 a c+(a \u2013 1) (c \u2013 1) = 2 a c \u2013 (a+c ) + 1 .\nIt can be assumed, without detriment to the proof, that a \u2265 c . Applying\nthis condition to (3.22) generates\na c+b d \u2264 2 a 2 \u2013 (a+c ) +1 < 2 a 2 ,\n\n(3.23)\n\ngiven that a> 1 , c > 1 for all cases. Since p = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2 b 2 = a 2 + 2 a b \u2013 b 2 ,\nand a > b , it is elementary to establish that\n(3.24)\n\n2 p = 2 a2 + 4 a b \u2013 2 b2 > 2 a2 .\n(3.23) and (3.24) can then be used with (3.21) to produce\np 2 (1+ 2 k 2) = (a c+b d+k p) 2 < (2 p+k p) 2 = p 2 (2 + k) 2\nand establish the condition\n\n(3.25)\n\n1+ 2 k 2 < (2+ k) 2 .\nCondition (3.25) sets the boundaries for any possible values of k. It is\nelementary to find that the intersection points which equalize the two sides\nof (3.25) are given by the values k = 2 \ue036 7 (see Figure 3). Consequently,\n(3.25) can only be satisfied within the range 2 \u2013 7 < k < 2 + 7 . Since k has\nto be a positive integer, the possible values to consider are k = 1, 2, 3 or 4.\nThese four possibilities can then be taken to (3.21) to evaluate the term\na c+b d as a function of p:\n\n50\n40\n30\n2\n\n1 + 2k\n\n20\n10\n\n(2 + k)\n-3\n\n2\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFigure 3.

Consider two odd integers, p and q (prime or not), that are properly\nrepresented by the quadratic form F (a , b) = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2 b 2, where a \u2261 b (mod 2) and\ngcd (a , b) = 1 , while satisfying a > b > 0 ,\np = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2b 2\n\nq = (c + d) 2 \u2013 2d 2 .\n\nTheir product N = p\u2219 q will also be represented by the form F (a , b) = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2b 2 ,\nwith the condition a > b > 0 equally satisfied.\nProof. From Lemma 3.2, equations (3.13) and (3.14) can be taken to produce\nN = p\u2219 q = ( A + B) 2 \u2013 2 B 2 = (C + D) 2 \u2013 2 D 2\nA = a c +b d ,\n\nB = b (c+d ) + d (a+b ) ,\n\nC = a (c+d ) + d (a \u2013 b ) ,\n\nD = bc \u2013 a d .\n\nSince a > b > 0 and c > d > 0 , it can immediately be concluded that A > 0 , B > 0 and\nC > 0 , although the sign of D = b c \u2013 a d is uncertain.\nIt can also be deduced that\nC = a (c+d ) + d (a \u2013 b ) = a c+2 a d \u2013 b d > a c \u2013 b d > b c \u2013 b d > b c \u2013 a d = D ,\n\n\fJ. A. PEREZ\n\n12\n\ntherefore, C > D . The sign of D , on the other hand, conveys three possibilities:\n(1) D = 0 . In this case, N = C 2 is a perfect square. Also b c = a d which, since\ngcd (a, b) = 1 and gcd (c, d) = 1 , implies that p = q .\n(2) D > 0 . This satisfies the theorem since C > D > 0 , as required.\n(3) D < 0 . Consider the opposite value D' = \u2013 D > 0 . It can be written that\nN = (C + D) 2 \u2013 2 D 2 = (C' + D' ) 2 \u2013 2 D' 2 = (C' + D' ) 2 \u2013 2 D 2 ,\n\n(3.34)\n\nwhich implies (C + D) 2 = (C' + D' ) 2. It is also the case that\n(3.35)\t\t\n\nD' = a d \u2013 b c < a d \u2013 b d < a c \u2013 b d < a c+2 a d \u2013 b d = C .\n\nConsequently, C + D = C \u2013 D' > 0 , so it is concluded that C \u2013 D' =|C' + D' |> 0 .\nSeeking a positive value for C', it can be assumed that C' + D' > 0 , hence\nC \u2013 D' = C' + D' , and finally C' = C \u2013 2 D'\n(3.36)\t\tC' = a (c+d )+d (a \u2013 b ) \u2013 2 (a d \u2013 b c ) = a c \u2013 b d+2 b c = c (a+b )+b (c \u2013 d ) > 0 .\nThe analysis of the relative values of C' and D' shows that\n(3.37)\t\t\n\nC' = a c+2 b c \u2013 b d > a d+2 b c \u2013 b d > a d+2 b c \u2013 b c > a d \u2013 b c > 0 .\n\ntherefore, C' > D' , satisfying the theorem.\nWith regard to the relative values of A and B , there are also three possibilities\nto considered:\n(1) A = B . This will imply that N = 2 A 2 , impossible since N \u2261 1 (mod 2).\n(2) A > B . This satisfies the theorem since A > B > 0, as required.\n(3) A < B . As in the proof of Theorem 3.1, consider a new representation\nwhere A' = A and B' = 2 A \u2013 B . In such case,\n(3.38)\n\nA' = A = a c+ b d > 0\nB' = 2 A \u2013 B = 2 a c+2 b c \u2013 (b c+a d+2 b d ) = a (c \u2013 d ) + c (a \u2013 b ) > 0 .\nSince A < B , B' = 2 A \u2013 B < A = A' , concluding that A' > B' > 0, which satisfies\nthe theorem.\n\nTherefore, the final conclusion is that, in all cases, there will be at least one\nrepresentation of N by the form F (a , b) = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2b 2 that is compliant with the\ncondition a > b > 0.\n\u00a3\nThe application of equation (3.12) to the form G (a', b' ) = a' 2 \u2013 2b' 2 allows proof\nby infinite descent of the following: when gcd (a', b' ) = 1 , every factor of N = a' 2 \u2013 2b' 2\nis itself represented by a form G (a', b' ) (see Exercise 2.2 in [11]). This can be\ncombined with Theorems 3.1, 3.3 and 3.4 to establish that the sums of the two\nsides (x + y) of the set of all primitive Pythagorean triangles represent integers N\nwhose factorizations include only primes of the form p \u2261 1,7 (mod 8). Consequently,\nit is possible to define the set of integers\n(3.39)\n\n{\n\nn\n\nS1,7 := N1,7 = \u220f pjkj = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2b 2 , a , b \u2208N , a > b > 0,\nj=1\ngcd (a , b) = 1, a \u2261 b (mod 2), pj \u2261 1,7 (mod 8) ,\n\n}\n\n\fTHE TRIANGULAR THEOREM OF THE PRIMES\n\nwhere\n\nn\n\n\u220f pjk\n\nj\n\nj=1\n\n13\n\nis the prime canonical factorization of N1,7 .\n\nSince pj \u2261 1,7 (mod 8) , it will always be the case that N1,7 \u2261 1,7 (mod 8) , explaining\nthe nomenclature used in (3.39).\nFor all purposes, it can be accepted that the form F (a , b) = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2b 2 , provided\nthat the condition a > b > 0 is satisfied, can be treated as any other positive definite\nform, despite having a positive discriminant ( \ue044 = 8 ). This is particularly useful\nwhen determining the total number of proper (primitive) representations of N1,7\nby the form F (a , b) . The theory of quadratic forms provides the necessary means\nto execute the calculation (see Section 8 in chapter VI of [10]). A few considerations\nare important:\n(1) There is only one primitive reduced form with discriminant \ue044 = 8 , this\nbeing G (a', b' ) = a' 2 \u2013 2b' 2 (see Table 5 in [27]).\n(2) The total number of automorphs, i.e. unimodular substitutions which\ntransform a form into itself [10], for the above primitive reduced form is\nw = 2.\n(3) The congruence h 2 \u2261 \ue044 (mod 4 N1,7) , since \ue044 = 8 and N1,7 \u2261 1 (mod 2) , hence\ngcd (\ue044, N1,7) = 1 , becomes\n(3.40)\n\nh 2 \u2261 2 (mod N1,7) .\nThe total number of incongruent solutions, h , of (3.40) (the condition\n0 \u2264 h < N1,7 is required) is the product of the solutions of h 2 \u2261 2 (mod pjkj) ,\nfor the various powers pjkj composing N1,7 , as outlined in (3.39). Given that\npj \u2261 1,7 (mod 8) , and 2 is a quadratic residue of these primes (for example,\nsee Theorem 11.6 of [28]), it can be concluded that h 2 \u2261 2 (mod pj) always\nhas two incongruent solutions. It can be proved by induction (a direct\nadaptation of the proof described by Section 5 in Chapter VI of [10]), that\nthe congruences h 2 \u2261 2 (mod pjkj) still have two solutions when kj > 1 .\nn\nHence, the total number of solutions of (3.40) is 2 where n , as in (3.39), is\nthe number of distinct prime factors of N1,7 .\n\n(4) The total number of proper representations of N1,7 is therefore given by\nn\nn\nw times 2 , this is 2.2 . These representations fall into groups of 4, which\nare obtained by changing the signs of a' = a + b and b' = b. Since the form\nF (a , b) = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2b 2 has only been defined for positive values of a and b,\nthe conclusion is that the actual number of distinct proper representations\nn \u20131\nis 2 .\nThe properties outlined in this section for the set of integers S1,7 (3.39) match\nclosely those described in the previous section for the set S1,5 (3.1). Such similarities\nemphasize the strong geometric parallels between the two binary quadratic forms,\nand the subsets of prime numbers they encompass.\n3.3. x + y \u2013 4r = (a \u2013 b) 2 + 2b 2. Equation (2.6) indicates that the sum of the two\nsides of a primitive Pythagorean triangle can be subtracted by four times the\nradius of the inscribed circle, the result being a binary quadratic form. The new\n\n\fJ. A. PEREZ\n\n14\n\nform, F' (a , b) = (a \u2013 b) 2+2b 2 , is found to be equivalent to another form G' (a', b' )\naccording to\nx + y \u2013 4r = (a \u2013 b) 2 + 2b 2 = a' 2 + 2b' 2 ,\n\n(3.41)\n\n(3.41) results from the transformation\nM = \uf8eb 1 0\uf8f6 , which induces the change (a \u2013 b, b) \u2192 (a , b) .\n\uf8ed 1 1\uf8f8\nThe transformation matrix M has determinant det (M) = +1; this makes the new\nmatrix unimodular and justifies the equivalence F' ~ G' [27, 30].\nThe equivalence F' ~ G' determines the type of integers that can be represented\nby F' (a , b) = (a \u2013 b) 2+2b 2 . As already illustrated by (1.2), all primes p \u2261 1,3 (mod 8) can\nbe expressed by the quadratic form G' (a', b' ) = a' 2 + 2b' 2 [4,9,11]. It is obvious that,\nto represent an odd prime, G' (a', b' ) not only needs gcd (a', b' ) = 1 , but also requires\na' \u2261 1 (mod 2). The parametrization (2.1) for primitive Pythagorean triangles, where\ngcd (a , b) = 1 , a \u2261 b (mod 2), and a > b > 0 , implies that a \u2013 b > 0 , and a \u2013 b \u2261 1 (mod 2),\nas well as gcd (a \u2013 b , b) = 1 . Hence, it can be concluded that the form F' (a , b) can\nrepresent odd primes. Furthermore, it is clear that every suitable pair (a', b' ) can be\naccommodated by primitive Pythagorean triangles, in line with the equivalence\nF' ~ G' . The application of equation (3.12) to these quadratic forms implies that\nthe previous conclusion can be extended to any integer N whose factorization\nincludes only prime divisors p \u2261 1,3 (mod 8) . Therefore, it is possible to define the\nset of integers\n\n{\n\nS1,3 := N1,3 = \u220f pjkj = (a \u2013 b) 2+2b 2 , a , b \u2208N , a > b > 0,\ngcd (a , b) = 1, a \u2261 b (mod 2), pj \u2261 1,3 (mod 8) ,\n\n(3.42)\nwhere\n\n\u220f pj\n\nkj\n\n}\n\nis the prime canonical factorization of N1,3 .\n\nSince pj \u2261 1,3 (mod 8) , it is always the case that N1,3 \u2261 1,3 (mod 8) , and this justifies\nthe nomenclature used in (3.42).\nThe binary quadratic forms F' ~ G' have a negative discriminant ( \ue044 = \u2013 8 ) , thus\nthey are positive definite. To determine the total number of proper (primitive)\nrepresentations of N1,3 by F' (a , b) = (a \u2013 b) 2+2b 2 , the calculation follows steps\nanalogous to those described in the previous section (as before, see Section 8 of\nChapter VI in [10]):\n(1) There is only one primitive reduced form with discriminant \ue044 = \u2013 8 , this\nbeing G' (a', b' ) = a' 2 + 2b' 2 (see table 4 in [27]).\n(2) The total number of automorphs for the above primitive reduced form is\nw = 2.\n(3) The congruence h 2 \u2261 \ue044 (mod 4 N1,3) , since \ue044 = \u2013 8 and N1,3 \u2261 1 (mod 2) and\nhence gcd (\ue044, N1,3) = 1 , becomes\n(3.43)\n\nh 2 \u2261 2 (mod N1,3) .\nThe total number of incongruent solutions, h , of (3.43) is again the product\nof the solutions of h 2 \u2261 2 (mod pjkj) , for the various powers pjkj composing\nN1,3 , as in (3.42). Since pj \u2261 1,3 (mod 8) , and \u2013 2 is a quadratic residue of\nthese primes (see, for example, Exercise 4 in page 201 of [7]), it can be\n\n\fTHE TRIANGULAR THEOREM OF THE PRIMES\n\n15\n\nconcluded that h 2 \u2261 2 (mod pj) always has two incongruent solutions. It can\nagain be proved by induction (as in Section 5 of Chapter VI in [10]), that\nthe congruences h 2 \u2261 2 (mod pjkj) still have only two solutions when kj > 1 .\nn\nConsequently, the total number of solutions of (3.43) is 2 where n , as in\n(3.42), is the number of distinct prime factors of N1,3 .\n(4) Accordingly, the total number of proper representations of N1,3 is given\nn\nn\nby w times 2 , this is 2.2 . These representations fall into groups of 4,\nobtained by changing the signs of a' = a \u2013 b and b' = b. Since the form\nF (a , b) = (a \u2013 b) 2+2b 2 is only defined for positive values of a and b, it is\nconcluded that the actual number of distinct proper representations is\nn \u20131\n2 . As in the preceding sections, when n = 1 , hence N1,3 simplifies to a\nsingle prime pj \u2261 1,3 (mod 8) , the representation is unique.\nTherefore, the properties outlined for the set of integers S1,3 (3.42) closely\nresemble those previously described for the sets S1,5 (3.1) and S1,7 (3.39). As the\noverall result, it can be stated that all odd primes are similarly represented by\nthree binary quadratic forms, and that these representations all have a direct\ngeometric interpretation within primitive Pythagorean triangles (Figure 2).\n4.

The answer is negative: it can be proved that, for any primitive\nPythagorean triangle, the three integers N1,3 , N1,5 and N1,7 are pairwise relatively\nprime, i.e. gcd (N1,3 , N1,5 ) = 1, gcd (N1,3 , N1,7 ) = 1 and gcd (N1,5 , N1,7 ) = 1 . One proof of\n\n\fJ. A. PEREZ\n\n18\n\nthis statement makes use of the following lemma.\nLemma 4.1. Consider two odd and distinct integers m and n : m \u2261 n \u2261 1 (mod 2) and\nm \u2260 n . If gcd ((m \u2013 n) / 2 , (m+ n) / 2 ) = 1 , then m and n are themselves relatively prime,\ni.e. gcd (m , n) = 1 .\nProof. Contrapositive. First assume that the integers m and n are not relatively\nprime, i.e. gcd (m , n) = d \u2260 1 . Hence, it can be written that m = pd and n = qd , where\np \u2261 q \u2261 d \u2261 1 (mod 2) . Accordingly,\n(4.3)\n\nm + n = (p + q) d\n\nm \u2013 n = (p \u2013 q) d ,\n\nwhere p \u00b1 q \u2261 0 (mod 2) . Since p , q \u2261 1 (mod 2) , it is elementary to deduce that\np \u00b1 q \u2261 0 (mod 2) and 2|(p\u00b1 q) . Consequently,\n(4.4)\n\np+ q = 2 s\n\np\u2013 q=2t ,\n\nand (4.4) can be taken to (4.3) to find\n(4.5)\n\n(m+ n) / 2 = s d\n\n(m \u2013 n) / 2 = t d .\n\nEquations (4.5) imply that d|[(m\u00b1 n) / 2] , i.e. gcd ((m \u2013 n) / 2 , (m+ n) / 2 ) \u2260 1 , hence\nnegating the original condition. Therefore, the final implication is that, if the\noriginal condition is satisfied, then m and n are relatively prime.\n\u00a3\nTheorem 4.2. In any primitive Pythagorean triangle, it will always be found that\nthe integers N1,7 = (a+b) 2 \u2013 2b 2 , N1,5 = a 2 + b 2 and N1,3 = (a \u2013 b) 2 + 2b 2 , where a , b \u2208N ,\na > b > 0, gcd (a , b) = 1, and a \u2261 b (mod 2) , are all pairwise relatively prime, i.e.\ngcd (N1,5 , N1,7 ) = 1 , gcd (N1,3 , N1,5 ) = 1 and gcd (N1,3 , N1,7 ) = 1 .\nProof. For all three cases, the strategy of the proof is to reach the statement\nformulated in Lemma 4.1 for the corresponding pairs of integers.\n(1) gcd (N1,5 , N1,7 ) = 1 .\nFrom the expressions for N1,5 and N1,7 , it can be derived that\nN1,7+N1,5 = (a+b) 2 \u2013 2 b 2 + a 2 + b 2 = 2 a 2 + 2 a b = 2 a (a+b)\n\n(4.6)\n\nN1,7 \u2013 N1,5 = (a+b) 2 \u2013 2 b 2 \u2013 a 2 \u2013 b 2 = 2 a b \u2013 2 b 2 = 2 b (a \u2013 b) ,\nand\n\n(4.7)\n\n( N1,7+N1,5 ) / 2 = a (a+b)\n\n( N1,7 \u2013 N1,5 ) / 2 = b (a \u2013 b) .\n\nSince gcd (a , b) = 1 , it is elementary that gcd (a (a+b) , b) =gcd (b (a \u2013 b) , a) = 1 .\nAlso, the condition a \u2261 b (mod 2) combines with gcd (a , b) = 1 to imply that\ngcd (a+b , a \u2013 b) = 1 . This can easily be demonstrated with a contrapositive\nproof: assuming that the opposite is true, i.e. gcd (a+b , a \u2013 b) \u2260 1 , it can\nthen be written that\n(4.8)\n\na+b = p d\n\na\u2013b=qd ,\n\nwhere d \u2260 1 . Given that a \u2261 b (mod 2) , then a+b \u2261 a \u2013 b \u2261 p \u2261 q \u2261 d \u2261 1 (mod 2)\nand, accordingly, p+q \u2261 p \u2013 q \u2261 0 (mod 2) . From (4.8), it can be derived that\n\n\fTHE TRIANGULAR THEOREM OF THE PRIMES\n\n19\n\n(a+b)+ (a \u2013 b) = 2 a = d (p+q)\n(a+b) \u2013 (a \u2013 b) = 2 b = d (p \u2013 q) ,\nand\n(4.9)\n\na = d (p+q) / 2 = d s\n\nb = d (p \u2013 q) / 2 = d t .\n\nEquations (4.9) imply that d|a and d|b , i.e. gcd (a , b) \u2260 1 , contradicting\nthe starting condition. Hence, gcd (a+b , a \u2013 b) = 1 , as required. From this,\nit can then be concluded that gcd (a (a+b) , b (a \u2013 b)) = 1 . The last statement\ncan be taken to (4.7) to deduce that gcd (( N1,7+ N1,5 ) / 2 , ( N1,7 \u2013 N1,5 ) / 2) = 1 .\nFinally, Lemma 4.1 means that gcd (N1,5 , N1,7 ) = 1 .\n\u00a3\n(2) gcd (N1,3 , N1,5 ) = 1 and gcd (N1,3 , N1,7 ) = 1 .\nAccording to (2.2) and (4.6), N1,7 \u2013 N1,5 = 2 b (a \u2013 b) = 2 r , where r is the length\nof the radius of the inscribed circle for the corresponding primitive\nPythagorean triangle. Hence, the preceding conclusion gcd (N1,5 , N1,7 ) = 1\nalso implies that gcd (N1,5 , r ) = gcd (N1,7 , r ) = 1 . Given that N1,5 \u2013 N1,3 = 2 r\nand N1,7 \u2013 N1,3 = 4 r , the final implication is that gcd (N1,3 , N1,5 ) = 1 and\ngcd (N1,3 , N1,7 ) = 1 , as required.\n\u00a3\nAs seen in the proof of Theorem 4.2, the radius r = b (a \u2013 b) and the hypothenuse\nz = N1,5 = a 2 + b 2 of any primitive Pythagorean triangle are relatively prime, i.e.\ngcd (r , z) = 1 . The same property is characteristic of the other two binary quadratic\nforms embedded in the triangle, N1,7 = x+y = (a+b) 2 \u2013 2b 2 and N1,3 = x+y \u2013 4 r =\n(a \u2013 b) 2 + 2b 2 , i.e. gcd (r , N1,7 ) = 1 and gcd (r , N1,3 ) = 1 . This observation is in sharp\ncontrast with the lack of relative primality most commonly associated with the\nsides of the triangle, x and y : taking from (2.1) that x = 2 a b , it is apparent that\ngcd (r , x) = b \u2260 1 , whenever b > 1 ; similarly, since y = a 2 \u2013 b 2 = (a+b) (a \u2013 b) , it is\nalso clear that gcd (r , y) = a \u2013 b \u2260 1 , whenever a > b+1 . Furthermore, with a single\nexception (i.e. when a = 2 and b = 1 , so that r = 1 , x = 4 and y = 3 ), it is evident\nthat no primitive Pythagorean triangle exists where gcd (r , x) = 1 and gcd (r , y) = 1\noccur simultaneously.\n5. Segregation of primes p \u2261 1 (mod 8)\nUsing the three binary quadratic forms, as described in Theorem 4.1, it is not\npossible to separate totally the representation of odd primes according to their\ncongruence modulo 8, given the ubiquitous nature of the primes p \u2261 1 (mod 8) .\nNevertheless, the parametrization (2.1) suggests the possibility of differentiating\nthe representations of N1,3 , N1,5 and N1,7 according to the specific (and opposing)\nparities of a and b. The following lemma provides the starting result.\nLemma 5.1. The binary quadratic forms N1,7 = (a+b) 2 \u2013 2b 2 and N1,3 = (a \u2013 b) 2 + 2b 2 ,\nwhere a , b \u2208N , a > b > 0 , gcd (a , b) = 1 , and a \u2261 b (mod 2) , always represent integers\nN1,7 \u2261 N1,3 \u2261 1 (mod 8) when a \u2261 1 (mod 2) . Alternatively, when a \u2261 0 (mod 2) , the\nrepresentations are N1,7 \u2261 7 (mod 8) and N1,3 \u2261 3 (mod 8) , respectively.\nProof. The two possibilities for the parities of a and b can be analysed separately.\n\n\fJ. A.

Also, b \u2261 0, 2, 4, 6 (mod 8) ,\ntranslating into b 2 \u2261 0, 4, 0, 4 (mod 8) , respectively, and into 2 b 2 \u2261 0 (mod 8) ,\nfor all cases. It can be concluded that (a \ue036 b) 2 \ue037 2 b 2 \u2261 1+0 \u2261 1 (mod 8) .\n\u00a3\n(2) a \u2261 0 (mod 2) , b \u2261 1 (mod 2) .\nAs before, a \ue036 b \u2261 1 (mod 2) and (a \ue036 b) 2 \u2261 1 (mod 8) . But now b 2 \u2261 1 (mod 8) ,\nwhich implies \ue037 2 b 2 \u2261 6, 2 (mod 8) , respectively. The final conclusion is that\n(a+b) 2 \u2013 2 b 2 \u2261 1+6 \u2261 7 (mod 8) , and (a \u2013 b) 2 + 2 b 2 \u2261 1+2 \u2261 3 (mod 8) .\n\u00a3\nThe binary quadratic form N1,5 = a 2 + b 2 makes no distinction between a and b,\nsince both parameters are interchangeable. Nevertheless, when considering the\neven term of the form, say b = 2 n , differences can be found depending on the\nparity of n.\nLemma 5.2. The binary quadratic form N1,5 = a 2 + b 2 = a 2 + 4 n 2 , where a , n \u2208N ,\ngcd (a , n) = 1 and a \u2261 1 (mod 2) , always represents integers N1,5 \u2261 5 (mod 8) when\nn \u2261 1 (mod 2) , and N1,5 \u2261 1 (mod 8) when n \u2261 0 (mod 2) .\nProof. The two possibilities for the parity of n can be analysed separately.\n(1) n \u2261 1 (mod 2) .\nSince a \u2261 1 (mod 2) , it is the case that a 2 \u2261 1 (mod 8) . Similarly, n 2 \u2261 1 (mod 8) .\nTherefore, it can be concluded that a 2 + 4 n 2 \u2261 1+4.1 \u2261 5 (mod 8) .\n\u00a3\n(2) n \u2261 0 (mod 2) .\nAgain, a 2 \u2261 1 (mod 8) , but now n 2 \u2261 0 (mod 8) . Hence, a 2 + 4 n 2 \u2261 1 (mod 8) . \u00a3\n\uf057\nUsing Lemmas 5.1 and 5.2, parity criteria can be taken to the binary quadratic\nforms representing N1,3 , N1,5 and N1,7 (see Theorem 4.1). As a consequence, the\nresulting expressions will only be able to represent odd primes of a single\ncongruence modulo 8, this is p \u2261 1, 3, 5, 7 (mod 8) , respectively.\nTheorem 5.1. All odd primes can be represented by binary quadratic forms,\naccording to their congruence modulo 8 :\n(1) For all primes p \u2261 3 (mod 8) , p \u2261 5 (mod 8) and p \u2261 7 (mod 8) , there will be\na single pair of positive integers, s and t , satisfying s \u2261 t \u2261 1 (mod 2) and\ngcd (s , t) = 1 , such that\n(5.1)\n(5.2)\n(5.3)\n\np = s2 + 2t2\np = s2 + 4t2\np = s2 + 4st + 2t2\n\nwhen\nwhen\nwhen\n\np \u2261 3 (mod 8) ,\np \u2261 5 (mod 8) ,\np \u2261 7 (mod 8) .\n\n(2) For all primes p \u2261 1 (mod 8) , there will be a single pair of positive integers,\ns and t, satisfying s \u2261 1 (mod 2) , t \u2261 0, 1 (mod 2) and gcd (s , t) = 1 , such that\n(5.4)\t\t\n(5.5)\t\t\n(5.6)\nand/or\n\np = s2 + 8t2 ,\np = s 2 + 16 t 2 ,\np = s2 + 8st + 8t2 .\n\n\fTHE TRIANGULAR THEOREM OF THE PRIMES\n\n21\n\nProof. All the representations (5.1) - (5.6) can be derived from Lemmas 5.1 and 5.2 .\n(1) p = s 2 + 2 t 2 , when p \u2261 3 (mod 8) .\nBased on Theorem 4.1 and Lemma 5.1 , all primes p \u2261 3 (mod 8) can be\nrepresented by p = (a \u2013 b) 2 + 2 b 2 , where a > b > 0 , gcd (a , b) = 1 , a \u2261 0 (mod 2)\nand b \u2261 1 (mod 2) . Since a > b , it is also possible to write a = s + t and b = t ,\nso that s \u2261 t \u2261 1 (mod 2) and gcd (s , t) = 1 . Consequently,\n\t\t\n\np = (a \u2013 b) 2 + 2 b 2 = (s + t \u2013 t) 2 + 2 t 2 = s 2 + 2 t 2 ,\n\nconfirming (5.1) .\n(2) p = s 2 + 4 t 2 , when p \u2261 5 (mod 8) .\nBased on Theorem 4.1 and Lemma 5.2, all primes p \u2261 5 (mod 8) can be\nrepresented by p = a 2 + 4 n 2 , where gcd (a , n) = 1 and a \u2261 n \u2261 1 (mod 2) . Thus,\nmaking a = s and n = t confirms (5.2) .\n(3) p = s 2 + 4 s t + 2 t 2 , when p \u2261 7 (mod 8) .\nBased on Theorem 4.1 and Lemma 5.1 , all primes p \u2261 7 (mod 8) can be\nrepresented by p = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2 b 2 , where a > b > 0 , gcd (a , b) = 1 , a \u2261 0 (mod 2)\nand b \u2261 1 (mod 2) . Since a > b , it can again be written that a = s + t and b = t ,\nso that s \u2261 t \u2261 1 (mod 2) and gcd (s , t) = 1 . Accordingly,\n\t\t\n\np = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2 b 2 = (s + t + t) 2 \u2013 2 t 2 = s 2 + 4 s t + 4 t 2 \u2013 2 t 2 = s 2 + 4 s t + 2 t 2 ,\n\nconfirming (5.3) .\n(4) p = s 2 + 8 t 2 , when p \u2261 1 (mod 8) .\nBased on Theorem 4.1 and Lemma 5.1 , all primes p \u2261 1 (mod 8) can be\nrepresented by p = (a \u2013 b) 2 + 2 b 2 , where a > b > 0 , gcd (a , b) = 1 , a \u2261 1 (mod 2)\nand b \u2261 0 (mod 2) . Since a > b , write a = s + b , where s \u2261 1 (mod 2) . Making\nalso b = 2 t , where t \u2261 0, 1 (mod 2) and gcd (s , t) = 1 , it is concluded that\n\t\t\n\np = (a \u2013 b) 2 + 2 b 2 = (s + 2 t \u2013 2 t) 2 + 2 (2 t) 2 = s 2 + 8 t 2 ,\n\nconfirming (5.4) .\n(5) p = s 2 + 16 t 2 , when p \u2261 1 (mod 8) .\nBased on Theorem 4.1 and Lemma 5.2, all primes p \u2261 1 (mod 8) can also be\nrepresented by p = a 2 + 4 n 2 , provided that gcd (a , n) = 1 , a \u2261 1 (mod 2) and\nn \u2261 0 (mod 2).

Therefore, it can be concluded that the\nrepresentations of all the odd primes by equations (5.1) - (5.6) are unique, exactly\nas they were for the original quadratic forms.\n\u00a3\nTo illustrate these results, Table 2 lists the representations of the odd primes\np < 100 according to the binary quadratic forms (5.1) - (5.6) , where all the values\nof the parameters s and t satisfy the conditions outlined in Theorem 5.1. The\ntable illustrates how these quadratic forms achieve a complete segregation of\nall odd primes according to their congruence modulo 8, while still providing\na unique representation in all cases. The latter fact is especially relevant to the\nbinary forms (5.3) and (5.6), since their discriminants are both positive (8 and 32,\nrespectively) and, consequently, their reduced forms (see Table 5 of [27]), being\nindefinite, generate an infinite number of representations for primes p \u2261 3 (mod 8)\nor p \u2261 1 (mod 8) , respectively. As already described in Section 3 and Theorem 5.1,\nthe restrictions imposed on the parameters a and b (s and t) are the factors that\nmake these representations unique.\nFigure 5 further illustrates Theorem 5.1.

In a similar fashion to the sets of integers S1,5 , S1,7 and S1,3 , defined\nby (3.1), (3.39) and (3.42), respectively, it is also possible to define four distinct sets\nS1 , S3 , S5 and S7 as follows:\n\n{\n\n(1) S1 := N1 = \u220f pjkj = s 2 + 8 t 2 , s 2 + 16 t 2 and/or s 2 + 8 s t + 8 t 2 , s , t \u2208N , s , t > 0,\n\t\t\t\ngcd (s , t) = 1, s \u2261 1 (mod 2), t \u2261 0, 1 (mod 2), pj \u2261 1 (mod 8) ,\n\n}\n\nwhere \u220f pj is the prime canonical factorization of N1 ; it is always the\ncase that N1 \u2261 1 (mod 8) .\nkj\n\n{\n\n(2) S3 := N3 = \u220f pjkj = s 2 + 2 t 2 , s , t \u2208N , s , t > 0,\n\t\t\ngcd (s , t) = 1, s \u2261 1 (mod 2), t \u2261 \u2211 kj (mod 2), pj \u2261 3 (mod 8) ,\n\n}\n\nwhere \u220f pjkj is the prime canonical factorization of N3 ; the integers N3\nare N3 \u2261 3 (mod 8) when \u2211 kj \u2261 1 (mod 2), but N3 \u2261 1 (mod 8) if \u2211 kj \u2261 0 (mod 2) .\n\n{\n\n(3) S5 := N5 = \u220f pjkj = s 2 + 4 t 2 , s , t \u2208N , s , t > 0,\n\t\t\ngcd (s , t) = 1, s \u2261 1 (mod 2), t \u2261 \u2211 kj (mod 2), pj \u2261 5 (mod 8) ,\n\n}\n\nwhere \u220f pjkj is the prime canonical factorization of N5 ; the integers N5\nare N5 \u2261 5 (mod 8) when \u2211 kj \u2261 1 (mod 2), but N5 \u2261 1 (mod 8) if \u2211 kj \u2261 0 (mod 2) .\n\n{\n\n(4) S7 := N7 = \u220f pjkj = s 2 + 8 s t + 8 t 2 , s , t \u2208N , s , t > 0,\n\t\t\ngcd (s , t) = 1, s \u2261 1 (mod 2), t \u2261 \u2211 kj (mod 2), pj \u2261 7 (mod 8) ,\n\n}\n\nwhere \u220f\nis the prime canonical factorization of N7 ; the integers N7\nare N7 \u2261 7 (mod 8) when \u2211 kj \u2261 1 (mod 2), but N7 \u2261 1 (mod 8) if \u2211 kj \u2261 0 (mod 2) .\npjkj\n\nBased on these definitions, it is obvious that the sets S1 , S3 , S5 and S7 are all\nsubsets of the corresponding sets S1,3 , S1,5 and S1,7 : while the sets S1 and S3 are\nboth subsets of S1,3 (3.42) , the sets S1 and S5 are both subsets of S1,5 (3.1) , and\nthe sets S1 and S7 are both subsets of S1,7 (3.39) . When determining the total\nnumber of proper (primitive) representations for any integer N1 , N3 , N5 and N7 ,\nthe latter observation combines with the fact that all such representations are\nuniquely related to distinct representations of the corresponding integer N1,3 , N1,5\nand/or N1,7 according to the relevant binary form used to define S1,3 , S1,5 and/or\nS1,7 (a direct implication of Theorem 5.1). Consequently, as already established in\nSection 3, the number of proper representations for every integer N1 , N3 , N5 or\nN7 is given by 2n \u20131, where n is the total number of distinct odd primes that divide\nthe integer.\nThe binary quadratic forms used to define sets S1,3 , S1,5 and S1,7 (Section 3 and\nTheorem 4.1) possess three fundamental and particularly significant properties:\n\n\fTHE TRIANGULAR THEOREM OF THE PRIMES\n\n25\n\ni) uniqueness, i.e. only a single representation can be constructed for any prime\nnumber expressed by the binary form; ii) completeness, i.e. every prime number\nof the given type can be represented by the corresponding binary form, without\nexception; and iii) exclusivity, i.e. the only integers represented by the binary\nform are those with a canonical factorization that only includes primes that are\nalso represented by the same form. Given the less restrictive parity conditions\nintroduced in the definitions of sets S1 , S3 , S5 and S7 , it should be no surprise\nthat the prime segregation achieved by Theorem 5.1 is gained at the expense\nof one of the above properties: although uniqueness and completeness are still\nsatisfied, it is perfectly clear that exclusivity is no longer maintained, since the\nsegregation of prime numbers (based on their congruences modulo 8) cannot\nbe universally transferred to all composite integers with prime canonical\nfactorizations that include primes pj \u2261 1 (mod 8) alongside primes pj \u2261 3 (mod 8) ,\npj \u2261 5 (mod 8) or pj \u2261 7 (mod 8) , respectively.\n6. Pythagorean prime triplets and conjectures\nTheorem 4.1 brings together the three binary quadratic forms characterized\nin Section 3 and states their intrinsic association with primitive Pythagorean\ntriangles (Figure 2). Given the composition of the integers N1,3 , N1,5 and N1,7 that\nconstitute sets S1,3 (3.42), S1,5 (3.1) and S1,7 (3.39), it is natural to consider the cases\nwhere all three integers are prime. Hence, the following definition.\nDefinition 6.1 (Pythagorean prime triplets). Consider a primitive Pythagorean\ntriangle, generated by the parametrization\nx = 2ab\n\ny = a2 \u2013 b2\n\nz = a2+b2\n\nfor integers a , b \u2208N, such that a > b > 0, gcd (a , b) = 1, and a \u2261 b (mod 2). Consider\nalso the three (geometrically) associated integers N1,3 = (a \u2013 b) 2 + 2b 2 \u2261 1,3 (mod 8) ,\nN1,5 = a 2 + b 2 \u2261 1,5 (mod 8) and N1,7 = (a+b) 2 \u2013 2b 2 \u2261 1,7 (mod 8) . The resulting triplet\n( N1,3 , N1,5 , N1,7 ) will be designated a 'Pythagorean prime triplet' if all three integers\nare prime.\nTable 3 lists some of the smallest Pythagorean prime triplets and makes use\nof the symbols p1,3 , p1,5 and p1,7 to identify the prime numbers according to the\nrespective binary quadratic forms that represent them. With the single exception\nof the first triplet in the list (i.e. 3, 5 and 7), it can be observed that the length\nof the radius is always r \u2261 0 (mod 3) . There is a simple reason for this pattern.\nAs can easily be verified, for the integer N1,3 = (a \u2013 b) 2 + 2b 2 to be N1,3 \u2261 0 (mod 3)\n(required by any prime number rather than 3), the parameters a and b , as well as\nsatisfying the condition gcd (a , b) = 1 , have to take values such that a \u2261 1 (mod 3)\nwhile b \u2261 0,1 (mod 3) , or a \u2261 2 (mod 3) while b \u2261 0,2 (mod 3) ; in all four cases, the radius\nr = b \u22c5 (a \u2013 b) can be found to be r \u2261 0 (mod 3) . Therefore, and with the exception of\n( 3 , 5 , 7 ) , for all Pythagorean prime triplets it is a necessary (but not sufficient)\ncondition that 3|r . This implies that the gap between primes must always be\np1,7 \u2013 p1,5 = p1,5 \u2013 p1,3 = 2 r \u2261 0 (mod 6) .\n\n\fJ. A. PEREZ\n\n26\n\nTable 3.

Given\nthat the gap (2 r) between the primes in the triplets is not restricted to very small\nvalues, it seems reasonable to anticipate that the progressive decline in prime\ndensity encountered in the number line is not a factor that affects the existence\nof the above triplets in the way it influences the existence of twin primes, or other\nprime pairs separated by equally small and fixed gaps [14,15,25]. On the other\nhand, the diminishing density of primes is still certain to have an impact on the\nlikelihood of finding three equally spaced prime numbers that are associated\nwith the same Pythagorean triangle. However, on balance, it can still be said\nthat the appearance of these prime sets along the number line is likely to\ncontinue. The expectation of having infinitely many Pythagorean prime triplets\nis encapsulated in the following conjecture.\nConjecture 6.2. Consider the set of all possible Pythagorean prime triplets.

Although the relative size of these two subsets of\nPythagorean prime triplets is clearly reduced when compared with the total set of\ntriplets, the expectation is to have infinitely many triplets of both types. Two more\nconjectures can therefore be formulated.\nConjecture 6.3. Consider the set of all possible Pythagorean prime triplets, where\nevery prime number is p \u2261 1 (mod 8) . Such a set is infinite.\nConjecture 6.4. Consider the set of all possible Pythagorean prime triplets, where\nevery prime number is p \u2261 1 (mod 8) . Such a set is infinite.\n\n\f28\n\nJ. A. PEREZ\n\nLemmas 5.1 and 5.2 can be brought to the analysis of Pythagorean prime\ntriplets where every prime number is either p \u2261 1 (mod 8) or p \u2261 1 (mod 8) . As is\neasily deduced, to ensure that all three primes in the triplet are p1 \u2261 1 (mod 8) , it is\nrequired that a \u2261 1 (mod 2) \u2261 1,3 (mod 4) (Lemma 5.1) and b \u2261 0 (mod 4) (Lemma 5.2);\nconsequently, r \u2261 0 (mod 4) and, since it is also required that r \u2261 0 (mod 3) , the final\ncondition is that r \u2261 0 (mod 12) , as confirmed by the examples included in Table 4.\nThe implication is that the gap between primes has to be 2 r \u2261 0 (mod 24) .\nAlternatively, to ensure that all three primes are p3, p5, p7 \u2261 1 (mod 8) , the\nrequirement is that a \u2261 0 (mod 4) (Lemmas 5.1 and 5.2) and, concomitantly, that\nb \u2261 1 (mod 2) \u2261 1,3 (mod 4) (Lemma 5.1); the resulting implication is r \u2261 1 (mod 4) .\nThis condition combines with r \u2261 0 (mod 3) to conclude, by applying the Chinese\nRemainder Theorem [7, 10, 28] , that the global requirement is r \u2261 9 (mod 12) , as the\nexamples given in Table 5 confirm, with the exception of ( 3 , 5 , 7 ). The implication\nis that the gap between primes must be p7 \u2013 p5 = p5 \u2013 p3 = 2 r \u2261 18 (mod 24) .\n7. Some concluding remarks\n7.1. Pythagorean triangles. The ability to generate Pythagorean triples seems\nto have preceded even the formulation of the Pythagorean Theorem itself [1, 19].\nDespite such an ancient heritage, various aspects of the mathematics associated\nwith Pythagorean triangles still attract the interest of current practitioners (for a\nsurvey of recent reports, see [5, 6, 12, 16, 17, 23, 24, 26] ). Intriguingly, the generating\nfunction of Pythagorean triples has also been found to play a significant role\nin the dynamics of a four-mode quantum system [31]. Consequently, any new\nobservation associated with the basic arithmetic and/or geometry of primitive\nPythagorean triangles may lead to additional findings and connections.\nThe key result of the present article (Theorem 4.1) focuses, not on the generation\nof primitive Pythagorean triples, but on some of the quadratic forms intimately\nlinked to their geometry. By doing so, it reveals a deep (and previously undetected)\nconnection between the triangles/triples and the totality of odd prime numbers\n(see Figures 2 and 4). While the identification of the hypothenuses (by equating\nto the sum of two squares) with odd integers N1,5 (3.1) whose factorization only\nincludes primes p \u2261 1 (mod 4) , goes back to the work of Fermat [11, 30] , the presence\nof two additional binary quadratic forms able to account for all odd integers\nN1,7 (3.39) or N1,3 (3.42), with factorizations that include only primes p \u2261 1,7 (mod 8)\nor p \u2261 1,3 (mod 8) , respectively, had clearly been overlooked.\nWhat makes the above observation particularly significant is that all three\nquadratic forms share striking algebraic similarities, as encapsulated by the\nthree properties listed in Section 5, i.e. uniqueness (a single representation for\nany given prime), completeness (every prime of the given type is represented,\nwithouth exceptions), and exclusivity (the only integers represented are those\nwith factorization that includes only primes of the given type). Compliance with\nall three properties is not a universal characteristic of quadratic forms and can\nonly be achieved when the Pythagorean conditions are met by the forms, i.e. for\neach form F (a , b) , the parametrization is such that a , b \u2208N , a > b > 0, a \u2261 b (mod 2)\n\n\fTHE TRIANGULAR THEOREM OF THE PRIMES\n\n29\n\np \u2261 1 (mod 2)\n2\n2\np=a \u2013b\n\np \u2261 1,3 (mod 8)\n2\n2\np = (a \u2013 b) + 2b\n\np \u2261 1,5 (mod 8)\n2\n2\np=a +b\n\np \u2261 1,7 (mod 8)\n2\n2\np = (a + b) \u2013 2b\n\na, b \u2261 N , a>b>0 , gcd (a, b) = 1 , a \u2261 b (mod 2)\nFigure 6. Four Pythagorean binary quadratic forms.\nand gcd (a , b) = 1 (see Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3). For any given integer represented\nby one of the three forms, the total number of primitive representations satisfies\nexactly the same criterion, and this is especially relevant to F (a , b) = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2b 2\n(Section 3.2) which, without the above conditions, would behave as an indefinite\nquadratic form [22, 27] .\nInterestingly, these three forms are not the only ones to be found within the\ngeometry of primitive Pythagorean triangles that fully comply with the three\nproperties already discussed. The odd side of the triangles, i.e. y = a 2 \u2013 b 2 (2.1)\n(Figure 1), accounts for any odd positive integer and the quadratic form involved,\ni.e. the difference of two squares, also meets all three requirements [22] . Hence,\nit is elementary that this form accounts for all odd primes p \u2261 1 (mod 2) . Figure 6\nillustrates how these four Pythagorean binary quadratic forms effectively\nconstitute two layers of representations for all odd prime numbers and their\ncorresponding composite integers, highlighting again the intimate connection\nbetween these quadratic forms and the primitive Pythagorean triangles\n(see Figures 1 and 2). Furthermore, it should be noted that the Pythagorean\nparametrization (2.1) also serves as a common template for the construction of\nthe four sets of integers and this fact, combined with the algebraic similarities\nbetween all four quadratic forms, perhaps might be used to extract other primary\nresults by elementary means.\nAnother comment can be made on possible ways to classify prime numbers.\nA distinction is normally made between primes p \u2261 1 (mod 4) , represented by\nthe sum of two squares, and primes p \u2261 3 (mod 4) , which are not [7, 28, 29] . This\ncriterion is reinforced by the fact that, when considering Gaussian integers,\nprimes p \u2261 3 (mod 4) are still Gaussian primes, while primes p \u2261 1 (mod 4) are not\n[28, 29] . Although such a classification is reasonable, the two resulting prime sets\nlack comparable algebraic properties, since there is no single binary quadratic\nform capable of representing all primes p \u2261 3 (mod 4) . The purpose of Figure 4\nis to emphasize that Theorem 4.1 provides an alternative classification for all\nodd primes that makes no formal distinctions between the three resulting sets\n\n\f30\n\nJ. A. PEREZ\n\nP1,3 , P1,5 and P1,7 . Given that subset P1 of primes p \u2261 1 (mod 8) is common to all\nthree prime sets, the result is three interlocking families of prime numbers that\n(accepting the basically identical algebraic structure of all three sets) produce an\naggregate with an apparent three-fold rotational symmetry (Figure 4). Without\nclaiming proof, it seems likely that this combination of binary quadratic forms is\nunique in representing all odd primes in this manner.\n7.2. Indefinite binary quadratic forms. Although the theory of quadratic forms\nis extremely well developed, particularly when concerning positive definite\nforms [4, 9, 11, 13, 21, 22, 27] , their ubiquity in number theory means that further\ngeneralizations are possible and the subject of very active research [15, 27, 29] .\nProgress is also regularly made in the characterization of indefinite quadratic\nforms [2, 3, 8] . Nevertheless, the results reported in this article indicate that\nfindings of a more elementary nature can still be made. In this context, the most\nsignificant finding described here is probably that the nature of indefinite binary\nquadratic forms can be changed under certain simple restrictions (Section 3.2).\nThe case of the form F (a , b) = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2b 2 is of immediate interest given the\nimplications for primitive Pythagorean triangles already discussed. But it is also\nindicative of similar considerations available to a more general case.\nWhen examining primitive reduced forms with positive discriminant \ue044 (see,\nfor example Table 5 in [27] ), it is clear that, whenever \ue044 \u2261 0 (mod 4) , there is one\nindefinite reduced form G (a', b' ) = a' 2 \u2013 k b' 2, for certain k \u2208N , k > 0. In line with the\ntransformation used in Section 3.2, it is conceivable that the above form G (a', b' )\ncould be transformed into F (a , b , k , l) = (a + l b) 2 \u2013 k b 2 , where k and l are fixed\nparameters k , l \u2208N , k > 0, l > 0, with a' = a + l b and b' = b . Hence, the equivalence\nF ~ G. After adopting once more the Pythagorean restrictions on parameters\na and b , i.e. a , b \u2208N , a > b > 0 and a \u2261 b (mod 2) , in order to ensure that the form\nF (a , b , k , l) always represents positive integers, i.e. F (a , b , k , l) = (a + l b) 2 \u2013 k b 2 > 0 ,\nit is apparent that a sufficient condition is (b + l b) 2 \u2265 k b 2 , translating into l \u2265 k \u2013 1 .\nConsequently, a suitable selection of the fixed parameters k and l is the only\nadditional prerequisite to avoid negative representations.\nAlthough a systematic evaluation is necessary to establish any potentially\nuseful consequences that might be derived from the above transformations,\nthe results reported in this article for the form F (a , b) = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2b 2 suggest\nthat similar findings might be possible, at least in part. As illustration, Table 6\nlists some representations for two forms F (a , b , k , l) = (a + l b) 2 \u2013 k b 2 of particular\ninterest, i.e. F (a , b , 8 , 3) = (a + 3 b) 2 \u2013 8 b 2 and F (a , b , 32 , 5) = (a + 5 b) 2 \u2013 32 b 2 . It is\nelementary to see that, in both cases, all integers N represented by the form are\nN \u2261 1 (mod 8) . Therefore, any prime numbers represented by these forms will\nalso be p \u2261 1 (mod 8) , as Table 6 confirms. Since neither 8 nor 32 are square-free\nintegers, the forms could have been written as F (a , b , 8 , 3) = (a + 3 b) 2 \u2013 2 (2 b) 2 and\nF (a , b , 32 , 5) = (a + 5 b) 2 \u2013 2 (4 b) 2 , respectively, both similar to G (a', b' ) = a' 2 \u2013 2 b' 2.\nThe implication is that the integers represented by either of the two forms are\nalso represented by G (a', b' ) = a' 2 \u2013 2 b' 2. Hence, the only primes that can appear in\ntheir factorizations are p \u2261 1,7 (mod 8) (see Section 3.2), as Table 6 also confirms.\n\n\fTHE TRIANGULAR THEOREM OF THE PRIMES\n\n31\n\nTable 6.

Therefore,\nthey achieve the same segregation of primes p \u2261 1 (mod 8) , without imposing any\nparity conditions.\nA key characteristic, common to all the forms F (a , b , k , l) = (a + l b) 2 \u2013 k b 2 (under\nthe Pythagorean parametric conditions), appears to be that their representations\nof primes are always unique. Since formula (3.12) can be universally applied\nto these forms, uniqueness of prime representation will imply that associated\ncomposite integers are also representable by the forms, with the total number of\nprimitive representations determined by their canonical factorization as before\n(Section 3). Although the actual set of prime numbers represented in each case\nhas to be established with care (for example, large values of k and l are certain to\npreclude the representation of some small primes), uniqueness of representation\nfor primes seems likely enough to prompt the following conjecture.\n\n1\nNot surprisingly, since both (a + 3 b) 2 \u2013 8 b 2 and s 2 + 8 s t + 8 t 2 are equivalent to the same reduced\nform G (a', b' ) = a' 2 \u2013 8 b' 2 , and (a + 5 b) 2 \u2013 32 b 2 = (a + 5 b) 2 \u2013 8 (2 b) 2 .\n\n\f32\n\nJ. A. PEREZ\n\nConjecture 7.1. Consider the binary quadratic forms F (a , b , k , l) = (a + l b) 2 \u2013 k b 2\nfor integers a , b \u2208N, such that a > b > 0, gcd (a , b) = 1, and a \u2261 b (mod 2) , with fixed\nparameters k , l \u2208N , k , l > 0 and l \u2265 k \u2013 1 . All the representations of prime numbers\nby these forms are unique.\nAs shown here, the representations by the form F (a , b) = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2 b 2 exhibit\nall three properties of uniqueness, completeness and exclusivity. This suggests\nthat the characterization of the more general case might also be of interest,\nalthough the property of exclusivity is likely to be particularly elusive.\n7.3. p = 2 , the lone prime. It is often claimed that 2 is the oddest of all prime\nnumbers, simply because 2 is the only even prime. While this is an elementary\nand obvious example of circular reasoning 2, the total absence (in primitive\nPythagorean triangles) of representations for 2 comparable to those found for all\nthe other primes can, in fact, be used as a sufficient argument to differentiate\nthis number from all its peers.\nNevertheless, the three binary quadratic forms listed in Theorem 4.1 also\nprovide a criterion for the association of 2 with another type of prime numbers,\nmore specifically with the primes p \u2261 1 (mod 8) . By assigning the same value to\nthe two parametrization parameters a and b , a = b , the output of all three forms\nbecomes the same, i.e. (a+a) 2 \u2013 2 a 2 = a 2+a 2 = (a \u2013 a) 2+2 a 2 = 2 a 2 . And, when a = 1 ,\nall three quadratic forms represent the same number, 2 . Therefore, this prime can\nbe represented by all three binary quadratic forms, in common with all primes\np \u2261 1 (mod 8) , 3 though in sharp contrast with the remaining primes p \u2261 3 (mod 8) ,\np \u2261 5 (mod 8) and p \u2261 7 (mod 8) , that are only represented by one of the forms.\nWhile these binary quadratic forms provide a basis to differentiate/associate 2\nfrom/with the other prime numbers, in turn, 2 itself offers another example of\nthe algebraic similarities between the forms. Consider the multiplication of any\nt\nof the integers N1,3 , N1,5 or N1,7 (Theorem 4.1) with a given power of 2, say 2 ,\nwhere t \u2208N and t > 0 . As already known for the sums of two squares [22] , it is\nt\napparent that, in all three cases, primitive representations of the products 2 \u2219 N1,3 ,\nt\nt\n2 \u2219 N1,5 or 2 \u2219 N1,7 (using the corresponding forms) can only be obtained if t = 1 .\nApplying formula (3.12), and considering one from any of all possible primitive\nrepresentations of N1,3 , N1,5 or N1,7 , respectively, the three cases can be analyzed\nseparately:\n(1) 2 \u2219 N1,5 = (1 2 + 1 2) (a 2 + b 2) = (1 a \ue037 1 b) 2 + (1 a \ue036 1 b) 2 = (a + b) 2 + (a \u2013 b) 2 .\nAs shown in the proof of Theorem 4.2, since a \u2261 b (mod 2) and gcd (a , b) = 1 ,\n\n2\nThe definition of prime number is sufficient to expose this myth. Clearly, 2 is the only prime\ndivisible by 2, in the same way that 3 is the only prime divisible by 3, 5 the only prime divisible by 5,\nand so on. What generates this distinction between 2 and the other odd primes is nothing more than\nthe use of parities commonly made when characterizing integers.\n3\nWhile this property associates 2 with all primes p \u2261 1 (mod 8) , something that still singles out 2 is\nthat the values of the parameters a and b required for its representations by all three forms are the\nsame ( a = b =1 ). This is never the case for any of the primes p \u2261 1 (mod 8) .\n\n\fTHE TRIANGULAR THEOREM OF THE PRIMES\n\n33\n\nthe implication is that gcd (a+b , a \u2013 b) = 1 , therefore the representation is\nprimitive and unique.\n(2) 2 \u2219 N1,7 = [(1+1) 2 \u2013 2 (1) 2] [(a+b) 2 \u2013 2 b 2] = (A+B) 2 \u2013 2 B 2 = (C+D) 2 \u2013 2 D 2 .\nAccording to (3.15) (Lemma 3.2), A = a+b , B = a+3 b , C = a+b , D = a \u2013 b .\nSince A < B , as in the proof of Theorem 3.4, A' = A and B' = 2 A \u2013 B = a \u2013 b .\nConsequently, since gcd (a+b , a \u2013 b) = 1 , 2 \u2219 N1,7 has a single representation\nthat is also primitive.\n(3) 2 \u2219 N1,3 = [(1 \u2013 1) 2+2 (1) 2] [(a \u2013 b) 2+2 b 2] = (A \u2013 B) 2+2 B 2 = (C \u2013 D) 2+2 D 2 .\nThe parameters A, B, C and D can be obtained by applying (3.12) and\nfollowing steps similar to those used in the proofs of Lemma 3.2 and\nTheorem 3.4. The result is again that A = C = a+b , and B = D = a \u2013 b . Thus,\nas in the preceding cases, 2 \u2219 N1,3 has a single primitive representation.\nUsing the forms F (a , b) = (a + b) 2 \u2013 2b 2 and F' (a , b) = (a \u2013 b) 2+2b 2 to construct\nthe primitive representations of 2 \u2219 N1,7 and 2 \u2219 N1,3 , respectively, is what makes it\npossible to determine the similarities between these two cases and 2 \u2219 N1,5 . It is\nsimple to verify that the use of formula (3.12) with the corresponding reduced\nforms, i.e. G (a', b' ) = a' 2 \u2013 2b' 2 and G' (a', b' ) = a' 2 + 2b' 2 , would have impeded the\ndetection of these similarities.\n\nReferences\n[1] Abdulaziz, A.
