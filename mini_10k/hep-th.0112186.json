Via Seiberg-Witten\nmap we match this symmetry transformation with a corresponding symmetry of commutative DBI. This allows to : 1) study new BPS type magnetic monopoles, with constant electric and magnetic background and describe them both in the commutative and\nin the noncommutative setting; 2) relate by S-duality space-noncommutative magnetic\nmonopoles to space-noncommutative electric monopoles.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nDirichlet branes effective actions can be described by noncommutative gauge theories,\nthe noncommutativity arising from a nonzero constant background NS B field, see [1]\nand references therein. In fact, when B 6= 0, the effective physics on the D-brane can be\ndescribed both by a commutative gauge theory L(F + B) and by a noncommutative one\nb Fb ), where\nL(\nFb\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc Ab\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd Ab\u03bc \u2212 i[Ab\u03bc \u22c6, Ab\u03bd ]\n(1)\n\nand \u22c6 is the Moyal star product; on coordinates [x\u03bc \u22c6, x\u03bd ] = x\u03bc \u22c6 x\u03bd \u2212 x\u03bd \u22c6 x\u03bd = i\u0398\u03bc\u03bd .\nThe noncommutativity parameter \u0398 depends on B and on the metric on the D-brane.\nThe commutative/noncommutative descriptions are related by Seiberg-Witten map (SW\nmap) [1]. Initially space-noncommutativity has been considered (\u0398ij 6= 0 i.e. Bij 6= 0)\nthen theories also with time noncommutativity (\u03980i 6= 0 i.e B0i 6= 0) have been studied\n[2]. It turns out that unitarity of noncommutative Yang-Mills theory (NCYM) holds only\nif \u0398 is space-like or light-like i.e. only if the electric and magnetic components of \u0398 (or\nB) are perpendicular and if the electric component is not bigger in magnitude than the\nmagnetic component. These are precisely the NCYM theories that can be obtained from\nopen strings in the decoupling limit \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 [3]. In this talk we consider these two kinds\nof space-time noncommutativity.\nIn Section 2 we show that for any space-noncommutative static solution we can turn\non time-noncommutativity and obtain a static solution with space-time noncommutativity. This holds in particular for solutions of noncommutative Dirac-Born-Infeld-theory\n(NCDBI). Via SW map we obtain the nontrivial action of this symmetry in the corresponding commutative DBI theory and show that it is a rotation (boost) between the\ntime component A0 of the gauge potential and the worldvolume D-brane coordinates xi .\n\u2217 Talk presented at the Symposium: 100 Years Werner Heisenberg - Works and Impact, workshop 3: Quantum Field\nTheory and Gravitation, September 26-30, 2001, Bamberg, Germany.\n\n1\n\n\fThis boost, first studied in [4], is similar to the target space rotation that relates the linear monopole to the nonlinear monopole [5], [4]. In Section 3 we study BPS solutions of\nNCDBI and DBI theories with both electric and magnetic background. In [6, 7] solutions\nto the BPS equations of noncommutative electromagnetism (NCEM), and of NCDBI, with\njust space-noncommutativity are found. The solution in [6] describes a smeared monopole\nconnected with a string-like flux tube and is interpreted as a D1-string ending on a D3brane with constant magnetic field background. We see that this solution remains a BPS\nsolution also when we turn on time-noncommutativity. The corresponding commutative\nconfiguration is also found: It is a new BPS configuration. Its energy is the energy of the\nintitial BPS monopole with only magnetic field plus the energy of a constant electric field\nin DBI theory. The new BPS configuration describes a monopole plus string in a background that is both electric and magnetic. The monopole has the fundamental magneton\ncharge and the string tension is that of a D1-string, this strongly suggests that we have a\nD1-D3 brane system with both electric and magnetic background. The D1-string tension\nis also matched with the string tension of the corresponding space-time noncommutative\nBPS monopole.\nFinally in Section 4 we address the issue of duality rotations in NCDBI and NCEM\n[8, 9]. At the field theory level duality is present only if \u0398 is light-like i.e. the magnetic\nand electric component of \u0398 are perpendicular and equal in magnitude [10, 11]. For \u0398\nspace-like as shown in [8] we do not have noncommutative gauge theory self-duality and\nthe S-dual of space-like NCEM is a noncommutative open string theory decoupled from\nclosed strings. A main point here is that under S-duality the magnetic background is\nmapped into an electric one, and this background does not lead to a field theory in the\n\u03b1\u2032 \u2192 1 limit. Since \u0398 must be light-like, it may seem that duality rotations have a very\nrestricted range of application. This is not the case because the symmetry we present in\nSections 2 and 3 changes the background too. It turns out that it is possible to compose\nduality rotations with this symmetry, we are thus able to consider duality rotations with\nbackground fixed and arbitrary. In particular we briefly discuss the S-dual of the D1-string\nD3-brane configuration of [6]; it describes an electric monopole plus string in a magnetic\nbackground, possibly a fundamental string ending on a D3-brane in the presence of a\nconstant magnetic field.\n\n2\n\nGauge theory with space-time noncommutativity\n\nWe use the following notations: \u0398 is a generic constant noncommutativity tensor, we have\n[x\u03bc \u22c6, x\u03bd ] = i\u0398\u03bc\u03bd ; \u03b8 is just a space-noncommutativity tensor \u03b8ij , \u03b80i = 0 ; \u03b8\u03b5 is a space-time\nnoncommutativity tensor obtained from \u03b8 adding electric components, \u03b8\u03b5 ij = \u03b8ij , \u03b8\u03b5 0i . In\nthree vector notation the electric and magnetic components of \u03b8, respectively \u03b8\u03b5 , are (0, \u03b8)\nand (\u03b5, \u03b8). The background fields corresponding to \u0398, \u03b8, \u03b8\u03b5 are B, b, b\u03b5 .\nb G, \u22c6 ) where \u03c6\nb are scalar fields\nb Fb , \u03c6,\nConsider a noncommutative Lagrangian Lb\u03b8 = L(\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\nand G is the metric. The equations of motion (EOM) for Lb read\nb G, \u22c6 ) = 0\nf\u03b1 (Fb , \u03c6,\n\u03b8\n\n(2)\n\nwhere f\u03b1 are functions of the noncommutative fields and their derivatives. We notice that\na static solution of the Lb\u03b8 EOM (2) is also a static solution of (2) with \u03b8\u03b5 instead of \u03b8,\n\u03b5\ni.e. it is a static solution of the Lb\u03b8 EOM. Indeed the star products \u22c6\u03b8 and \u22c6\u03b8\u03b5 act in the\nsame way on time independent fields. Moreover the energy and charges of the solution\n2\n\n\fare invariant. A similar \u03b8-\u03b8\u03b5 symmetry property holds if the fields are independent from\na coordinate x\u03bc (not necessarily t). This \u03b8-\u03b8\u03b5 symmetry property of static solutions can\nbe used to construct moving solutions of a space-noncommutative theory Lb\u03b8 from static\nsolutions of the same theory Lb\u03b8 . Indeed, given \u03b8, if we turn on an electric component such\nthat \u03b5 \u22a5 \u03b8 and |\u03b5| < |\u03b8|, then with a Lorentz boost we can transform this new \u03b8\u03b5 into\na space-like \u03b8\u2032 proportional to the initial \u03b8. Rescaling \u03b8\u2032 \u2192 \u03b8 we thus obtain a solution\n(moving with constant velocity) of the space-noncommutative Lagrangian Lb\u03b8 .\nWe now use SW map and study how the \u03b8-\u03b8\u03b5 symmetry acts in the commutative theory.\n\u03b5\nb A\nb\nWe have to consider the two SW maps SW\u03b8 and SW\u03b8 . In general a static solution \u03c6,\n\u03bc\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\u03b5\nb\nis mapped by SW and SW into two different commutative solutions, however if A0 = 0\n\u03b5\nthen SW\u03b8 = SW\u03b8 . This can be seen from the index structure of SW map. In general we\nhave\nA\u03bc = Ab\u03bc +\n\u03c6 = \u03c6b +\n\nX\n\nn>s\n\nX\n\nn>s\n\nb\n(\u0398(n) \u2202 (n+s) Ab(n\u2212s) A)\n\u03bc\n\n(3)\n\n\u0398(n) \u2202 (n+s) Ab(n\u2212s) \u03c6b\n\nwhere the number of times n, n + s, n \u2212 s that \u0398, \u2202, Ab appear is dictated by dimensional\nanalysis. In (3) we do not specify which \u2202 acts on which Ab and we do not specify the\ncoefficients of each addend. Because of the index structure we notice that \u03980i never enters\nb A\nb are time independent and A\nb = 0. The commutative fields \u03c6, A corresponding\n(3) if \u03c6,\n0\ni\nb A\nb (i 6= 0) are solution of both L\u03b8 and L\u03b8\u03b5 . Here L\u03b8 and L\u03b8\u03b5 are the commutative\nto \u03c6,\ni\n\u03b5\nLagrangians corresponding to Lb\u03b8 and Lb\u03b8 via SW map. In the case of the DBI Lagrangian\n\u03b5\nwith a scalar field \u03c6, L\u03b8 and L\u03b8 reads\n\u22121 q\nLDBI (F + b, \u03c6, g, gs) = \u2032 2\n\u2212det(g + \u03b1\u2032 (F + b) + \u03b1\u2032 2 \u2202\u03c6a \u2202\u03c6a )\n(4)\n\u03b1 gs\nand LDBI (F + b\u03b5 , \u03c6, g \u03b5, gs ). We should write gs\u03b5 instead of gs in this last expression,\nhowever we can rescale Gs and thus impose the invariance of the closed string coupling\nconstant gs . The relation between closed\nq and open string parameters is given by (see [1]):\n\u2032\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u2032\n(g + \u03b1 B) = G + \u0398/\u03b1 , Gs = gs detG det(g + \u03b1\u2032 B)\u22121 .\nIn order to have a more explicit formulation of the \u03b8-\u03b8\u03b5 symmetry, from now on we\nset the noncommutative open string metric G = \u03b7 = diag(\u22121, 1, 1, 1) and we consider\n(rigid) coordinate transformations x \u2192 x\u2032\u2032 and x \u2192 x\u2032 that respectively orthonormalize\nthe closed string metrics g \u03b5 and g, while preserving time independence of the transformed\n\u03c6 , A fields. The result is that if \u03c6\u2032 , A\u2032i , A\u20320 = 0 is a static solution of LDBI then \u03c6\u2032\u2032 , A\u2032\u2032\u03bc\nis a new static solution [11].

As shown in [4] it follows that \u021e(\u03c8 \u2032 , \u03c7\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ) is the action of a space-like\n3-brane immersed in a target space of coordinates X \u2032A = {\u03b1\u2032\u03c8 \u2032 , \u03b1\u2032\u03c7\u2032 , \u03b1\u2032 \u03c6\u2032 , x\u2032 i } and metric\n\u03b7 = diag(\u22121, \u22121, 1, 1, 1, 1)\nZ\n\nv\n!\nu\n\u22121 Z 3 \u2032 u\n\u2202X \u2032A \u2202X \u2032B\nt\n.\nd x det \u03b7AB\n=\n\u2202x\u2032 i \u2202x\u2032 j\ngs \u03b1 \u2032 2\n\nd3 x\u2032 \u021e\n\n(7)\n\nIt is the SO(2, 4) symmetry [4] of this static gauge action that is relevant in our context:\nConsider the Lorentz transformation Y A = \u039bAB X \u2032B (where X \u2032 i = x\u2032 i ) and express Y A\nas Y A = Y A (y i ) (where Y i = y i ) so that we are still in static gauge; the action (7) is\ninvariant under X \u2032A (x\u2032 i ) \u2192 Y A (y i ).

This solution describes a D1where 2r\nstring ending on a D3-brane. Because of the magnetic backgound field b on the brane the\nstring is not perpendicular to the brane, in (8) the string is vertical and the brane is tilted\nw.r.t. the horizontal direction. The magnetic force acting on the end of the D1-string is\ncompensated by the tension of the D1-string.\nA BPS solution of NCDBI with space-like noncommutativity given by \u03b812 = \u2212\u03b8, (all\nothers \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd = 0) has been studied in [6]. It is a static solution with Ab0 = 0. This\nnoncommutative BPS solution is caracterized by a noncommutative string tension and\na magneton charge. It is expected to correspond, via SW map (and the target space\nrotation relating the linear monopole to the nonlinear one [5]), to (8). A first evidence is\nthe correspondence between the tension of the noncommutative string and that of the D1string [6], then in [7] the spectrum of small fluctuations around (a limit of) this solution\nis studied and found in agreement with the expectations from string theory.\nWe now discuss what happens to these commutative/noncommutative BPS solutions\nwhen we apply the \u03b8-\u03b8\u03b5 symmetry. The result [11] is that we obtain two new BPS solutions that describe a D1-string ending on a D3-brane with both an electric and magnetic\nbackground.

Since NCDBI\nand its \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 1 limit, NCEM, admit duality rotations only if \u03b8 is light-like, it seems\nthat we have a F1-D3 system only if we consider a light-like background. This light-like\ncondition may appear a strong constraint. Actually, using the \u03b8-\u03b8\u03b5 symmetry we are\nnot bound to consider only this restrictive case of light-like background. Indeed for any\nspace-noncommutative static solution we can turn on time-noncommutativity and obtain\na static solution with light-like noncommutativity. We can then apply a duality rotation,\nswitch off the time-noncommutativity and thus obtain a new solution of the original pure\nspace-noncommutative theory.\nIn particular in order to obtain the duality rotated configuration of the one described\nin [6], we consider the corresponding commutative configuration (8), that in the x\u2032 orthonormal frame reads Bi\u2032 = \u2212\u2202i\u2032 \u03c6\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 = \u2212 \u03b11\u2032 \u03b8x\u2032 3 \u2212 21r\u2032 , r \u2032 2 \u2261 (x\u2032 1 )2 + (x\u2032 2 )2 + (x\u2032 3 )2 .\nIn order to have a light-like background we turn on a constant electric field keeping here\nfixed Gs besides the open string metric G = \u03b7 (therefore here gs \u2192 gs\u03b5 6= gs ). We then\n5\n\n\fobtain (9) and (10) with e\u2032\u2032 = \u2212b\u2032\u2032 (i.e. \u03b8 = \u03b5). Next we duality rotate this solution\nand obtain (12) and (13) with gs\u03b5D , gs\u03b5 instead of gsD , gs . Finally we go back to the original x-reference system (the x \u2192 x\u2032\u2032 coordinate transformation commutes with duality\nrotations), we apply SW map and arrive at the noncommutative fields AbD , \u03c6bD with open\nstring coulping constant, metric and light-like noncommutativity given by\n1\n1\n1\nGDs =\n, GD\u03bc\u03bd =\n\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd , \u03b8D\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd = Gs \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 \u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03c3 .\n(14)\nGs\nGs\n2\nThe noncommutative fields AbD , \u03c6bD correspond to a fundamental string ending on a D3b GD , GD , \u22c6 ) where\nbrane with light-like background. These fields solve also LbDBI (Fb , \u03c6,\n\u03b8D\ns\n\u03b8D (\u03b8D13 = Gs \u03b8, all others \u03b8D\u03bc\u03bd = 0) is just the space part of \u03b8D\u03b5 ; they describe an electric\nmonopole with a string attached. Since the noncommutative string tension and charges\nare invariant under \u03b8D\u03b5 \u2192 \u03b8D , the AbD , \u03c6bD fields are a good candidate to describe an F-string\nending on a D3-brane with constant magnetic background.\nAcknowledgements\nI wish to thank the organizers and Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung for the stimulating\natmosphere of the conference.
