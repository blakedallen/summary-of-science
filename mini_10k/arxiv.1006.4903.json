The control polygon of a B\u00e9zier curve is well-defined and has geometric\nsignificance-there is a sequence of weights under which the limiting position of the curve\nis the control polygon. For a B\u00e9zier surface patch, there are many possible polyhedral control structures, and none are canonical. We propose a not necessarily polyhedral control\nstructure for surface patches, regular control surfaces, which are certain C 0 spline surfaces.\nWhile not unique, regular control surfaces are exactly the possible limiting positions of a\nB\u00e9zier patch when the weights are allowed to vary.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn geometric modeling of curves and surfaces, the overall shape of an individual patch is\nintuitively governed by the placement of control points, and a patch may be finely tuned\nby altering the weights of the basis functions-large weights pull the patch towards the\ncorresponding control points. The control points also have a global meaning as the patch\nlies within the convex hull of the control points, for any choice of weights.\nThis convex hull is often indicated by drawing some edges between the control points.\nThe rational bicubic tensor product patches in Figure 1 have the same weights but different\ncontrol points, and the same 3 \u00d7 3 quadrilateral grid of edges drawn between the control\npoints. Unlike the control points or their convex hulls, there is no canonical choice of these\n\nFigure 1.

We paraphrase a question posed to us by Carl de Boor and Ron Goldman: What\nis the significance for modeling of such control structures (control points plus edges)?\nWe provide an answer to this question. These control structures, the triangles, quadrilaterals, and other shapes implied by these edges, encode limiting positions of the patch\nwhen the weights assume extreme values. By Theorems 5.1 and 5.2, the only possible\nlimiting positions of a patch are the control structures arising from regular decompositions\n(see Section 4) of the points indexing its basis functions and control points, and any such\nregular control structure is the limiting position of some sequence of patches.\nHere are rational bicubic patches with the control points of Figure 1 and extreme weights.\n\nEach is very close to a composite of nine bilinear tensor product patches-corresponding\nto the nine quadrilaterals in their control structures. The control points of each limiting\nbilinear patch are the corners of the corresponding quadrilateral. These are all planar\npatches on the left, while only the corner quadrilaterals are planar on the right.\nThe control structure in these examples is a regular decomposition of the 3 \u00d7 3 grid\nunderlying a bicubic patch. It is regular as it is induced from the upper convex hull of\nthe graph of a function on the 16 grid points. Such a function could be 0 at the four\ncorners, 2 at the four interior points and 1 at the remaining eight edge points. We show\nthis decomposition on the left below together with an irregular decomposition on the right.\n\n(1)\n\n(If the second decomposition were the upper convex hull of the graph of a function on the\ngrid points, and we assume-as we may-that the central square is flat, then the value of\nthe function at a vertex is lower than the values at a clockwise neighbor, which is impossible\noutside of Escher woodcuts.)\nSuch control structures and limiting patches were considered in [2], but were restricted\nto triangulations-this restriced the scope of the results. Our results hold in complete generality and like those of [2], rely upon a construction in computational algebraic geometry\ncalled a toric degeneration [7, Ch. 8.3.1].\nWhile our primary interest is to explain the meaning of control nets for the classical\nrational tensor product patches and rational B\u00e9zier triangles, we work in the generality of\nKrasauskas' toric B\u00e9zier patches [11, 12]. The reason for this is simple-any polygon may\n\n\fTORIC DEGENERATIONS OF B\u00c9ZIER PATCHES\n\n3\n\narise in a regular decomposition of the points underlying a classical patch. On the left below\nis a regular decomposition of the points in the 2 \u00d7 2 grid underlying a biquadratic patch\nand on the right is a degenerate patch, which consists of four triangles and Krasauskas's\ndouble pillow. The pillow corresponds to the central quadrilateral in the 2 \u00d7 2 grid, with\nthe 'free' internal control point corresponding to the center point of the grid.\n\n(2)\n\nWhile our primary interest is in surface patches, our definitions and arguments make\nsense in any dimension. Our discussion will concern surface patches but the proofs in the\nappendix will be given for patches of any dimension.\nWe remark that we do not address the variation diminishing property, which is another\nfundamental global aspect of the control polygon of a rational B\u00e9zier curve. This states\nthat the total variation of a B\u00e9zier curve is bounded by the total variation in the control\npolygon. Generalizing this to surfaces is important and interesting, but we currently do\nnot know how to formulate variation diminishing for general toric patches.\nThis note is organized as follows. We first recall basics of rational B\u00e9zier triangles and\nrational tensor product patches and their control nets. Next, we present Krasauskas' toric\nB\u00e9zier patches and introduce the crucial notion of a regular polyhedral decomposition. In\nthe last section we define the main object in this paper, a regular control surface, which\nis a union of toric B\u00e9zier patches governed by a regular decomposition. We also state our\ntwo main theorems, Theorem 5.1, that regular control surfaces are limits of toric B\u00e9zier\npatches, and Theorem 5.2, that if a patch is sufficiently close to a control surface, then\nthat control surface must be regular. Proofs appear in the appendix, where we work in\nthe generality of toric patches in arbitrary dimension. Our main tools are results of [9, 10]\nwhich identify all possible toric degenerations of a projective toric variety.\n2. B\u00e9zier patches and control nets\nWe define rational B\u00e9zier curves and surfaces and tensor product patches in a form that\nis convenient for our discussion, and then describe their control nets. Our presentation\ndiffers from the standard formulation [5] in that the degree is encoded by the domain. This\nlinear reparametrization does not affect the resulting curve or surface. Write R\u2265 for the\nnonnegative real numbers and R> for the positive real numbers.\nLet d be a positive integer. For each i = 0, . . . , d define the Bernstein polynomial \u03b2i;d (x),\n\u03b2i;d (x) := xi (d \u2212 x)d\u2212i .\n\u0001\n(Substituting x = dy and multiplying by di d\u2212d for normalization, this becomes the usual\nBernstein polynomial. This nonstandard presentation, omitting the binomial coefficients,\n\n\f4\n\nL. GARC\u00cdA-PUENTE, F. SOTTILE, AND C-G. ZHU\n\nstresses the separate role of functions and weights.) Given weights w0 , . . . , wd \u2208 R> and\ncontrol points b0 , . . . , bd \u2208 Rn (n = 2, 3), we have the parameterized rational B\u00e9zier curve\nPd\nwi bi \u03b2i;d (x)\n: [0, d] \u2212\u2192 Rn .\nF (x) := Pi=0\nd\ni=0 wi \u03b2i;d (x)\n\nOur domain is [0, d] rather than [0, 1], for this is the natural convention for toric patches.\nThe control polygon of the curve is the union of segments b0 , b1 , . . . , bd\u22121 , bd . Here are\ntwo rational cubic B\u00e9zier planar curves with their control polygons.\nb1\nb2\n\nb2\nb1\n\n(3)\n\nb0\nb3\nb0\nb3\nThere are two standard ways to extend this to surfaces. The most straightforward gives\nrational tensor product patches. Let c, d be positive integers and for each i = 0, . . . , c and\nj = 0, . . . , d let w(i,j) \u2208 R> and b(i,j) \u2208 R3 be a weight and a control point. The associated\nrational tensor product patch of bidegree (c, d) is the image of the map [0, c] \u00d7 [0, d] \u2192 R3 ,\nPc Pd\nj=0 w(i,j) b(i,j) \u03b2i;c (x)\u03b2j;d (y)\ni=0\n.\nF (x, y) :=\nPc Pd\nw\n\u03b2\n(x)\u03b2\n(y)\n(i,j)\ni;c\nj;d\nj=0\ni=0\n\nTriangular B\u00e9zier patches are another extension. Set\nd\n\n:= {(x, y) \u2208 R2 | 0 \u2264 x, y and x + y \u2264 d}\n\nand set A := d \u2229 Z2 , the points with integer coordinates (lattice points) in the triangle\nd . For (i, j) \u2208 A, we have the bivariate Bernstein polynomial\n\u03b2(i,j);d (x, y) := xi y j (d \u2212 x \u2212 y)d\u2212i\u2212j .\nGiven weights w = {w(i,j) | (i, j) \u2208 A} and control points B = {b(i,j) | (i, j) \u2208 A}, the\nassociated triangular rational B\u00e9zier patch is the image of the map d \u2192 R3 ,\nP\n(i,j)\u2208A w(i,j) b(i,j) \u03b2(i,j);d (x, y)\nP\n.\nF (x, y) :=:\n(i,j)\u2208A w(i,j) \u03b2(i,j);d (x, y)\n\nThe control points of a B\u00e9zier curve are naturally connected in sequence to give the\ncontrol polygon, which is a piecewise linear caricature of the curve. For a surface patch\nthere are however many ways to interpolate the control points by edges to form a control\nnet. There also may not be a way to fill in these edges with polygons to form a polytope.\nEven when this is possible, the significance of this structure for the shape of the patch is\nnot evident, except in special cases. For example, if the control points are the graph of a\nconvex function over the lattice points, then the patch is convex [3, 4]. For such control\npoints, the obvious net consists of the upward-pointing facets of the convex hull of the\ngraph. This is the net of the bicubic patches in Figure 1.\n\n\fTORIC DEGENERATIONS OF B\u00c9ZIER PATCHES\n\n5\n\n3. Toric patches and toric varieties\nKrasauskas's toric patches [11] are a natural extension of rational B\u00e9zier triangles and\nrational tensor product patches to arbitrary polygons whose vertices have integer coordinates, called lattice polygons. They are based on toric varieties [1, 6] from algebraic\ngeometry which get their name as they are natural compactifications of algebraic tori\n(C\u2217 )n , where C\u2217 := C \\ {0}. They are naturally associated to lattice polygons (and in\nhigher dimensions, lattice polytopes), and the positive real part [6, Ch. 4] [14] of a toric\nvariety is canonically identified with the corresponding polygon/polytope.\nToric patches begin with a finite set A \u2282 Z2 of (integer) lattice points. The convex hull\nof A is the set of all convex combinations\nX\nX\npa a\nwhere\npa \u2265 0\nand\n1 =\npa\na\u2208A\n\na\u2208A\n\nof points of A, which is a lattice polygon and is written \u2206A . To each edge e of \u2206A , there\nis a valid inequality he (x, y) \u2265 0 on \u2206A , where he (x, y) is a linear polynomial with integer\ncoefficients having no common integer factors that vanishes on the edge e. For example, if\nA = d \u2229 Z2 , then \u2206A = d and the inequalities are\nx \u2265 0,\n\ny \u2265 0,\n\nand d\u2212x\u2212y \u2265 0.\n\nFor another example, the central quadrilateral of (2) has inequalities\nx+y\u22121 \u2265 0, 1+x\u2212y \u2265 0, 3\u2212x\u2212y \u2265 0, and 1+y\u2212x \u2265 0.\nLet E be the set of edges of the polygon \u2206A . To each lattice point a \u2208 A, define the toric\nbasis function \u03b2a,A : \u2206A \u2192 R to be\nY\n\u03b2a,A(x, y) :=\nhe (x, y)he(a) .\ne\u2208E\n\nThis is strictly positive in the interior of \u2206A . If a lies on an edge e of \u2206A , then \u03b2a,A is\nstrictly positive on the relative interior of e, and if a is a vertex, then \u03b2a,A (a) > 0. In\nparticular the toric basis functions have no common zeroes in \u2206A .\nObserve that the toric basis functions for A = [0, c] \u00d7 [0, d] \u2229 Z2 and A = d \u2229 Z2\nare equal to the Bernstein polynomials \u03b2i;c (x)\u03b2j;d (y) and \u03b2(i,j);d (x, y) underlying the tensor\nproduct and triangular B\u00e9zier patches.\nToric patch also require weights and control points. Let #A be the number of points in\n#A\nA. Let RA\n> be R> with coordinates (za \u2208 R> | a \u2208 A) indexed by elements of A. A toric\nB\u00e9zier patch of shape A is given by a collection of positive weights w = (wa | a \u2208 A) \u2208 RA\n>\nand control points B = {ba | a \u2208 A} \u2282 R3 . These define a map \u2206A \u2192 R3 ,\nP\na\u2208A wa ba \u03b2a,A (x, y)\n.\n(4)\nFA,w,B (x, y) := P\na\u2208A wa \u03b2a,A (x, y)\nSince the toric basis functions are nonnegative on \u2206A and have no common zeroes, this\ndenominator is strictly positive on \u2206A . Write YA,w,B for the image of \u2206A under the map\nF , which is a toric B\u00e9zier patch of shape A.\nThe map F : \u2206A \u2192 R3 admits a factorization\n\n(5)\n\n\u03b2\n\nA\nF : \u2206A \u2212\u2212\u2212\n\u2192\n\nA\n\nw*\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nA\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u2212\u2212B\u2192 R3 ,\n\n\f6\n\nL.

The standard simplex\nP\nA\n:= {z \u2208 RA\n\u2265 |\na\u2208A za = 1}\n\nis the convex hull of the standard basis in RA .

Elements a of Z2 are exponents of monomials,\n\na = (a, b) \u2190\u2192 xa y b ,\nwhich we will write as xa . The points of A define a map \u03c6A : R2> \u2192\n\nA\n\nby\n\n\u03c6A (x, y) := [xa | a \u2208 A] .\nThe closure in A of the image of \u03c6A is the toric variety XA . We have the following result\nof Krasauskas [11].\nProposition 3.1. The image of \u2206A under the map \u03b2A is the toric variety XA .\nToric patches share with rational B\u00e9zier patches the following recursive structure. If a\nis a vertex of \u2206A , then ba = FA,w,B (a) is a point in the patch. If e is the edge between two\nvertices of \u2206A , then the restriction FA,w,B |e of FA,w,B to e is the 1-dimensional toric patch\ngiven by the points of A lying on e and the corresponding weights, which is a rational\nB\u00e9zier curve. For example, the edges of the rational bicubic patches in Figure 1 are all\nrational cubic B\u00e9zier curves.\n\n\fTORIC DEGENERATIONS OF B\u00c9ZIER PATCHES\n\n7\n\n4. Regular polyhedral decompositions\nWe recall the definitions of regular (or coherent) polyhedral subdivisions from geometric\ncombinatorics, which were introduced in [7, \u00a7 7.2]. Because subdivision has a different\nmeaning in modeling, we instead use the term decomposition. Let A \u2282 R2 be a finite set\nand suppose that \u03bb : A \u2192 R is a function. We use \u03bb to lift the points of A into R3 . Let\nP\u03bb be the convex hull of the lifted points,\nP\u03bb = conv{(a, \u03bb(a)) | a \u2208 A} \u2282 R3 .\nEach face of P\u03bb has an outward pointing normal vector, and its upper facets are those\nwhose normal has positive last coordinate. If we project these upper facets back to R2 ,\nthey cover the polygon \u2206A and are the facets of the regular polyhedral decomposition T\u03bb\nof \u2206A induced by \u03bb. (Lower facets also induce a regular polyhedral subdivision, which\nequals T\u2212\u03bb , and so it is no loss of generality to work with upper facets.)\nThe edges and vertices of T\u03bb are the images of the edges and vertices lying on upper\nfacets. Here are the upper facets and regular polyhedral decompositions given by two\ndifferent lifting functions for the points A underlying a biquadratic tensor product patch.\n\nMore generally, a polyhedral decomposition of \u2206A is a collection T of polygons, line\nsegments, and points of A, whose union is \u2206A , where any edge, vertex, or endpoint of\na segment also lies in T , and any two elements of T are either disjoint or their intersection\nis an element of T . A decomposition T is regular if it is induced from a lifting function.\nA decomposition S of the configuration A of points is a collection S of subsets of A\ncalled faces. The convex hulls of these faces are required to be the polygons, line segments,\nand vertices of a polyhedral decomposition T (S) of \u2206A . In particular, the intersection of\nany face with the convex hull \u2206F of another face F of S is either empty, a vertex of \u2206F ,\nor the points of F lying in some edge of \u2206F . A face F is a facet, edge, or vertex of S as\nits convex hull \u2206F is a polygon, line segment, or vertex. The decomposition S is regular\nif the polyhedral decomposition T (S) is regular.\nBelow are two different lifting functions that induce the same regular polyhedral decomposition of the 2 \u00d7 2 square underlying a biquadratic patch, but different regular\n\n\f8\n\nL. GARC\u00cdA-PUENTE, F. SOTTILE, AND C-G. ZHU\n\ndecompositions of A.\n\nThe center point of A does not lie in any face of the decomposition on the right as its lift\ndoes not lie on any upper facet.\nHere is a one-dimensional example. Let \u03bb take the values {0, 1, 2, 0} on the points\n{0, 1, 2, 3} underlying rational cubic B\u00e9zier curves. This induces a regular decomposition\nof {0, 1, 2, 3} with facets\n{0, 1, 2}\n\n(7)\n\n{2, 3} .\n\nand\n\n5. Regular control surfaces\nRegular control surfaces are possible limiting positions of patches. We first illustrate\nthese notions on a rational cubic curve in the plane. The curves of (3) have weights\n(1, 4, 4, 1) on the Bernstein polynomials \u03b20;3 , \u03b21;3 , \u03b22;3 , \u03b23;3 , respectively. The lifting function\ninducing the decomposition (7) gives a family of weights (1, 4t, 4t2 , 1) as t \u2208 R> varies.\nWhen t = 5, and we use the control points of (3), we get the following curves.\nb1\nb2\nb2\n\nb1\n\n(8)\n\nb0\nb3\nb0\nb3\nTo consider the limit as t \u2192 \u221e, write the Bernstein polynomials in homogeneous form as\n\u03b2i;3 := ui v 3\u2212i for i = 0, . . . , 3, for then the cubic curve is the image of points (u, v) \u2208 (R> )2 .\nLimiting positions are given by restrictions to the facets of the decomposition (7). Multiplying the \u03b2i;3 by the weights and restricting to each facet, we get basis functions\n{v 3 , 4tv 2 u, 4t2vu2 } ,\n\nand\n\n{4t2 vu2, u3 } .\n\nThese give rational B\u00e9zier curves\nv 3 b0 + 4tv 2 ub1 + 4t2 vu2b2\n4t2 vu2 b2 + u3 b3\nand\n.\nv 3 + 4tv 2 u + 4t2 vu2\n4t2 vu2 + u3\nDividing out the common factor of v from the first and replacing tu by u, and similarly\ndividing out u2 from the second and replacing vt2 by v, we get\nv 2 b0 + 4vub1 + 4u2 b2\nv 2 + 4vu + 4u2\n\nand\n\n4vb2 + ub3\n,\n4v + u\n\n\fTORIC DEGENERATIONS OF B\u00c9ZIER PATCHES\n\n9\n\nwhich are rational quadratic and linear B\u00e9zier curves. With the control points of (8) these\nare,\nb1\n\nb2\n\nb2\n\nb1\n\n(9)\n\nb0\n\nb3\n\nb0\n\nb3\n\nThese are regular control surfaces of the corresponding curves induced by the decomposition (7). We explain this in general.\nLet A \u2282 Z2 be a finite set, w \u2208 RA\n> be weights and B = {ba | a \u2208 A} be control points\nfor a toric patch YA,w,B of shape A.\nSuppose that we have a decomposition S of A. We may use the weights w and control\npoints B indexed by elements of a facet F as weights and control points for a toric patch\nof shape F , written YF ,w|F ,B|F . In fact, this can be done for any face of S. The union\n\nYA,w,B (S) :=\n\n[\n\nYF ,w|F ,B|F ,\n\nF \u2208S\n\nof these patches is the control surface induced by the decomposition S. As the domain of\na patch of shape F is the convex hull \u2206F of F and faces of toric patches are again toric\npatches, the control surface of a patch induced by a decomposition is naturally a C 0 spline\nsurface. A control surface YA,w,B (S) is regular if the decomposition S is regular.\nHere are the control surfaces of the bicubic patches from Figure 1.\n\nThese control surfaces are regular as they are induced by the 3 \u00d7 3 grid, which is a regular\ndecomposition. Below is the irregular decomposition of the 3 \u00d7 3 grid from (1) and a\n\n\f10\n\nL. GARC\u00cdA-PUENTE, F. SOTTILE, AND C-G.

The polygonal frame formed by the corresponding control points on the right\nis the control polygon for this edge of C, which is a rational cubic B\u00e9zier curve.\nWe show that regular control surfaces are exactly the possible limits of toric patches\nwhen the control points B are fixed but the weights w are allowed to vary. In particular,\nthe irregular control surface (10) cannot be the limit of toric B\u00e9zier patches.\nLet \u03bb : A \u2192 R be a lifting function. We use this and a given set of weights w = {wa \u2208\nR> | a \u2208 A} to get a set of weights which depends upon a parameter, w\u03bb (t) := {t\u03bb(a) wa |\na \u2208 A}.

Our first main result is that\nthe regular control surface YA,w,B (S\u03bb ) induced by S\u03bb is the limit of the patches YA,w,B,\u03bb(t)\nparameterized by FA,w,B,\u03bb(x; t) as t \u2192 \u221e.\nThis limit is with respect to the Hausdorff distance between two subsets of R3 . Two\nsubsets X and Y of R3 are within Hausdorff distance \u01eb if for every point x of X there is\nsome point y of Y within a distance \u01eb of x, and vice-versa. With this notion of distance,\nwe have the following result.\nTheorem 5.1. lim YA,w,B,\u03bb(t) = YA,w,B (S\u03bb ).\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nThat is, for every \u01eb > 0 there is a number M such that if t \u2265 M, then the patch\nYA,w,B,\u03bb(t) and the regular control surface YA,w,B (S\u03bb ) are within Hausdorff distance \u01eb.\nWe illustrate Theorem 5.1 on a bicubic patch.

Toric degeneration of a rational tensor product patch of bidegree (3, 3).\nWe will prove Theorem 5.1 in Appendix A. The key idea is the factorization (5) of the\nmap FA,w,B,\u03bb(x; t) through the simplex A . This factorization allows us to study the limit\nin Theorem 5.1 by considering the effect of the family of weights w\u03bb (t) on the toric variety\nA\nXA in\n.

We show how work of Kapranov, Sturmfels, and Zelevinsky [9, 10] implies that the\nset of all translated toric varieties is naturally compactified by the set of all regular control\nsurfaces in A . Thus some subsequence of {XA,wi } converges to a regular control surface\nA\n, whose image must coincide with Y , implying that Y is a regular control surface.\nin\nThis method of proof does not give a simple way to recover a lifting function \u03bb or the\nweight w from the sequence of weights w 1 , w 2, . . . .\nWe prove Theorem 5.1 in Appendix A and Theorem 5.2 in Appendix B. While both\nrequire more algebraic geometry than we have assumed so far, Appendix A is more elementary and Appendix B is significantly more sophisticated.\nAppendix A. Proof of Theorem 5.1\nLet d, n be positive integers. The definitions and results of Sections 3, 4, and 5, as well\nas the statements of Theorems 5.1 and 5.2 make sense if we replace A \u2282 Z2 by A \u2282 Zd\nand B \u2282 R3 by B \u2282 Rn . We work here in this generality. This requires straightforward\nmodifications such as replacing polygon by polytope and in general removing restrictions\non dimension. We invite the reader to consult [2] for a more complete treatment.\nA\nIf the control points B are the vertices {ea | a \u2208 A} \u2282 RA of the simplex\n, then the\ntoric patch YA,w,B is the (translated) toric variety XA,w .

Then the interior of the segment a, b meets some\nface \u2206F of T (S\u03bb ). If F is the minimal such face, then the interiors of a, b and \u2206F meet\nin a point p, and so we have the valid relation on XA,w ,\nY \u03b1\nY \u03b1\n(16)\nza\u03bc zb\u03bd *\nwf f = wa\u03bc wb\u03bd *\nzf f ,\nf \u2208F\n\nf \u2208F\n\nby Proposition A.4, where\np := \u03bca + \u03bdb =\n\nX\n\n\u03b1f f\n\nand\n\n\u03bc+\u03bd = 1 =\n\nf \u2208F\n\nX\n\n\u03b1f ,\n\nf \u2208F\n\nand the coefficients \u03bc, \u03bd, \u03b1f are positive.

It follows that this set of equations (18) holds on every accumulation point of\nthe family {XA,w\u03bb (t) | t \u2208 R> }, which implies that those accumulation points lying in F\nare a subset of XF ,w|F .\nTo show the other inclusion, for each face F of S\u03bb , let XF\u25e6 ,w|F consist of those points\nz \u2208 XF ,w|F with zf 6= 0 for f \u2208 F . Evidently we have\na\nXF\u25e6 ,w|F ,\nXA,w (S\u03bb ) =\nF \u2208S\u03bb\n\nand so it suffices to prove that every point of XF\u25e6 ,w|F is a limit point of the family {XA,w\u03bb (t) |\nt \u2208 R> }.\nSince F is a face of S\u03bb , there is a vector v \u2208 Rd such that the function A \u2192 R,\na 7\u2212\u2192 v * a + \u03bb(a)\nis maximized on F with maximum value \u03b4.

Proof of Theorem 5.2\nTheorem A.1 shows that a limit of translates of XA,w by a one-parameter subgroup\nof RA\n> (a toric degeneration of XA,w ) is a regular control surface. This is a special and\nreal-number case of more general results of Kapranov, Sturmfels, and Zelevinsky [9, 10]\nconcerning all possible toric degenerations of the complexified toric variety XA (C) that we\nwill use to prove Theorem 5.2.\nSuppose the A \u2282 Zd is a finite set of integer lattice points. We will assume that A is\nprimitive in that differences of elements of A span Zd :\nZd = Zha \u2212 a\u2032 | a, a\u2032 \u2208 Ai ,\nthat is, A affinely spans Zd (if not, then simply replace Zd by the affine span of A). Let\nPA be the complex projective space with homogeneous coordinates [za | a \u2208 A] indexed\nby elements of A. (These are extensions to all of PA of the homogeneous coordinates (6),\nwhich were valid for the nonnegative part of PA .) The complex torus H := (C\u2217 )d naturally\nacts on PA with weights given by the set A: t \u2208 H sends the point z with homogenous\ncoordinates [za | a \u2208 A] to the point t.z := [ta za | a \u2208 A]. Note that XA,1 (C) is the\nclosure of the orbit of H through the point 1 := [1 : . . . : 1]. For w \u2208 (C\u2217 )A , the translate\nw.XA,1 (C) =: XA,w (C) is also the closure of the orbit of H through the point w (considered\nA\nas a point in PA ). Note that\nis the nonnegative real part [6, Ch. 4] of PA , and when\n\u2217 A\nw \u2208 RA\n> \u2282 (C ) , then XA,w is the nonnegative real part of XA,w (C).\nA toric degeneration of XA,1 (C) is any translate XA,w (C), or any limit of translates\nlim \u03bb(t).XA,w (C)\nt\u21920\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2217 A\n\nwhere \u03bb : C \u2192 (C ) is a one-parameter subgroup. This limit is the same limit as in\nSection A, its ideal is the limit of the ideals of \u03bb(t).XA,w (C) as t \u2192 0. We remark that the\ndata of a one-parameter subgroup of (C\u2217 )A are equivalent to homomorphisms of abelian\ngroups ZA \u2192 Z and thus to functions \u03bb : A \u2192 Z, which explains our notation \u03bb.\nThe translates XA,w (C) for w \u2208 (C\u2217 )A give a family of subvarieties of PA , each with the\nsame dimension and degree, and each equipped with an action of H. A main result of [9, 10]\nidentifies all suitable limits of these translates XA,w (C) with the points of a complex projective toric variety CA (C). The points of CA (C) in turn are in one-to-one correspondence\nwith all possible complex toric degenerations of XA,w (C) as w ranges over (C\u2217 )A . For a\ntoric degeneration X of a translate of XA,1 (C), we write [X] for the corresponding point\nof CA (C). We will use this result to prove Theorem 5.2 as follows.\nProof of Theorem 5.2. Fix control points B = {ba | a \u2208 A} \u2282 Rn and suppose that\n{w 1, w 2 , . . . } is a sequence of weights in RA\n> such that the sequence of toric patches {YA,w i ,B |\ni = 1, 2, . . . } converges to a set Y in Rn in the Hausdorff topology.\nConsider the corresponding sequence {XA,wi (C) | i = 1, 2, . . . } of torus translates of\nXA (C). This gives a sequence [XA,wi (C)] of points in the projective toric variety CA (C).\nSince CA (C) is compact, this sequence of points has a convergent subsequence whose limit\n\n\f18\n\nL. GARC\u00cdA-PUENTE, F. SOTTILE, AND C-G. ZHU\n\npoint is a toric degeneration\nlim XA,w\u03bb (t) (C) = XA,w (S\u03bb )(C) =\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\n[\n\nXF ,w|F (C)\n\nF \u2208S\u03bb\n\nof XA,w (C) for some w \u2208 (C\u2217 )A and lifting function \u03bb : ZA \u2192 Z. Replacing the original\nweights {w i } by this subsequence, we may assume that, as points of CA (C), we have\n(21)\n\nlim [XA,wi (C)] = [XA,w (S\u03bb )(C)] = lim [XA,w\u03bb (t) (C)] .\nt\u2192\u221e\n\ni\u2192\u221e\n\nThe points [XA,wi (C)] of CA (C) are translates of the base point [XA (C)] by elements of\n\u2217 A\nRA\n> \u2282 (C ) , and so they lie in the nonnegative real part of the toric variety CA (C), and\ntherefore so does their limit point. But by (21) this limit point is a translate of XA (S\u03bb )(C),\nand thus it is a translate by a real weight. This shows that we may take the weight w\nin (21) to be real.\nTheorem 5.2 will follow from this and the claim that if a sequence {[Xi ] | i \u2208 N} \u2282 CA (C)\nconverges to a point [X] of CA (C) in the (usual) analytic topology, then the sequence of\ncorresponding subvarieties {Xi } converges to X in the Hausdorff metric on subsets of PA .\nGiven this claim, (21) implies that in the Hausdorff topology on subsets of PA ,\nlim XA,wi (C) = lim XA,w\u03bb (t) (C) = XA,w (S\u03bb )(C) .\nt\u2192\u221e\n\ni\u2192\u221e\n\nWe may restrict this to their real points to conclude that the limit of patches XA,wi in\nA\n,\nlim XA,wi = lim XA,w\u03bb (t) = XA,w (S\u03bb ) ,\ni\u2192\u221e\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nis a regular control surface. Since YA,wi,B = \u03c0B (XA,wi ), the limit limi\u2192\u221e YA,wi ,B equals\n\u0001\n\u0001\nlim \u03c0B (XA,wi ) = \u03c0B lim XA,wi = \u03c0B XA,w (S\u03bb ) = YA,w,B (S\u03bb ) ,\ni\u2192\u221e\n\ni\u2192\u221e\n\nwhich is a regular control surface. This will complete the proof of Theorem 5.2, once we\nhave proven the claim.\n\u0003\n\nProof of claim. As shown in [9, 10], the projective toric variety CA (C) is the Chow quotient\nof PA by the group H = (C\u2217 )d acting via the weights of A. We explain this construction.\nLet D = d! * volume(\u2206A ), which is the degree of the projective toric variety XA (C), as well\nas any of its translates. Basic algebraic geometry (see [8, Lect. 21]) gives us the existence\nof a complex projective variety C(D, d, A), called the Chow variety, whose points are in\none-to-one correspondence with d-dimensional cycles in PA of degree D. These are formal\nlinear combinations\nm\nX\nDj Z j\n(22)\nZ :=\ni=1\n\nwhere each coefficient Dj is a nonnegative integer, each Zj is a reduced and irreducible\nsubvariety of PA of dimension d, and we have\nm\nX\nD =\nDj * degree(Zj ) .\nj=1\n\nIn particular all translates XA,w (C) are represented by points of C(D, d, A).\n\n\fTORIC DEGENERATIONS OF B\u00c9ZIER PATCHES\n\n19\n\nThe torus (C\u2217 )A (in fact (C\u2217 )A /H) acts on PA and thus on C(D, d, A), with the points\nrepresenting the translates XA,w forming a single orbit. The Chow quotient CA (C) is the\nclosure of this orbit in C(D, d, A). An explicit description of CA (C) in terms of a quotient\nfan or the secondary polytope of A is more subtle and may be found in [9, 10]. We do not\nneed this description to prove Theorem 5.2, although such a description could be used to\nhelp identify the limit control surface whose existence is only asserted by Theorem 5.2.\nThe points of CA (C) correspond to toric degenerations of translates XA,w (C). We describe this, associating a cycle of degree D and dimension d to any toric degeneration. Let\n\u03bb : ZA \u2192 Z be any lifting function with corresponding regular decomposition S\u03bb of A. Let\nF \u2282 A be a facet of S\u03bb . Set \u03b4F to be the index in Zd of the lattice\nZhf \u2212 f \u2032 | f, f \u2032 \u2208 F i\nspanned by differences of elements of F . Then XF ,w|F (C) is a subvariety of PF of dimension\nd and degree\nd! * volume(\u2206F )/\u03b4F .\nThe toric degeneration\nlim XA,w\u03bb (t) (C) =\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nF\n\n[\n\na facet of\n\nXF ,w|F (C)\nS\u03bb\n\n(this is a set-theoretic limit) corresponds to the cycle\nX\n\u03b4F XF ,w|F (C) ,\nF a facet of S\u03bb\nwhich has degree D = d! * volume(\u2206A ).\nWe now prove the claim. Following Lawson [13, Sect. 2], Kapranov, Sturmfels, and\nR\nZelevinsky [9, Sect. 1] associate to a cycle (22) a current on PA -the linear functional Z\nof integrating a smooth 2d-form over the cycle Z. The analytic topology on the Chow\nvariety is equivalent to the weak topology on currents. (The weak topology is the topology\nof pointwise convergence: A sequence {\u03c8i | i \u2208 N} of currents converges to a current \u03c8 if\nand only if for every 2d-form \u03c9 on PA we have limi\u2192\u221e \u03c8i (\u03c9) = \u03c8(\u03c9), as complex numbers.)\nSuppose that {[Xi ]} \u2282 CA (C) is a convergent sequence of points in the usual analytic\ntopology on CA (C), with limit point [X],\nlim [Xi ] = [X] .\n\ni\u2192\u221e\n\nThen the associated currents converge. That is, for every smooth 2d-form \u03c9, we have\nZ\nZ\n(23)\nlim\n\u03c9 =\n\u03c9.\ni\u2192\u221e\n\nXi\n\nX\n\nWe use this to show that limi\u2192\u221e Xi = X, in the Hausdorff metric.\nR\nGiven a point x \u2208 X and a number \u01eb > 0, let \u03c9 be a 2d-form with X \u03c9 6= 0 which\nvanishes outside the ball B(x, \u01eb) of radius\n\u01eb around x. Then (23) implies that there is a\nR\nnumber M such that if i > M, then Xi \u03c9 6= 0, and thus Xi \u2229 B(x, \u01eb) 6= \u2205. Since X is\ncompact, there is some number M such that if i > M, then every point of X is within a\ndistance \u01eb of a point of Xi .\n\n\f20\n\nL. GARC\u00cdA-PUENTE, F. SOTTILE, AND C-G. ZHU\n\nTo complete the proof of the claim, we need to show that for every number \u01eb > 0, there\nis a number M such that if i > M, then every point of Xi lies within a distance \u01eb of\nX. Suppose that this is not true. That is, there is a number \u01eb > 0 such that for every\nnumber M, there is some i > M such that Xi has a point whose distance from X exceeds\n\u01eb. Replacing {Xi } by a subsequence, we may assume that each Xi has a point xi whose\ndistance from X exceeds \u01eb. It is no loss to assume that the points xi are smooth. By the\ncompactness of PA and of the Grassmannian of d-dimensional linear subspaces of PA , we\nmay replace {Xi } by a subsequence and assume that the points xi converge to a point x,\nand that the tangent spaces Txi Xi also converge to a linear\nR space L. It follows that there\nis a 2d-form \u03c9 which vanishes outside of B(x, \u01eb/2) and L \u03c9 6= 0. By our assumption on\nthe sequence of tangent spaces Txi Xi , we will have\nZ\n\u03c9 6= 0 .\nlim\ni\u2192\u221e\n\nXi\n\nR\n\nBut then (23) implies that X \u03c9 6= 0, and so X \u2229 B(x, \u01eb/2) 6= \u2205, which contradicts our\nassumption that X is the limit the spaces Xi .\nThis completes our proof of the claim, and therefore of Theorem 5.2.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] David Cox, John Little, and Hal Schenck, Toric varieties, Graduate Studies in Mathematics, American\nMathematical Society, 2011.\n[2] Gheorghe Craciun, Luis Garc\u0131\u0301a-Puente, and Frank Sottile, Some geometrical aspects of control points\nfor toric patches, Mathematical Methods for Curves and Surfaces, Lecture Notes in Computer Science,\nvol. 5862, Springer, 2010, pp. 111\u2013135.\n[3] Wolfgang Dahmen, Convexity and Bernstein-B\u00e9zier polynomials, Curves and surfaces (ChamonixMont-Blanc, 1990), Academic Press, Boston, MA, 1991, pp. 107\u2013134.\n[4] Wolfgang Dahmen and Charles A.

For a B\u00e9zier surface patch, there are many possible polyhedral control structures, and none are canonical. We propose a not necessarily polyhedral control\nstructure for surface patches, regular control surfaces, which are certain C 0 spline surfaces.\nWhile not unique, regular control surfaces are exactly the possible limiting positions of a\nB\u00e9zier patch when the weights are allowed to vary.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn geometric modeling of curves and surfaces, the overall shape of an individual patch is\nintuitively governed by the placement of control points, and a patch may be finely tuned\nby altering the weights of the basis functions-large weights pull the patch towards the\ncorresponding control points. The control points also have a global meaning as the patch\nlies within the convex hull of the control points, for any choice of weights.\nThis convex hull is often indicated by drawing some edges between the control points.\nThe rational bicubic tensor product patches in Figure 1 have the same weights but different\ncontrol points, and the same 3 \u00d7 3 quadrilateral grid of edges drawn between the control\npoints. Unlike the control points or their convex hulls, there is no canonical choice of these\n\nFigure 1.

We paraphrase a question posed to us by Carl de Boor and Ron Goldman: What\nis the significance for modeling of such control structures (control points plus edges)?\nWe provide an answer to this question. These control structures, the triangles, quadrilaterals, and other shapes implied by these edges, encode limiting positions of the patch\nwhen the weights assume extreme values. By Theorems 5.1 and 5.2, the only possible\nlimiting positions of a patch are the control structures arising from regular decompositions\n(see Section 4) of the points indexing its basis functions and control points, and any such\nregular control structure is the limiting position of some sequence of patches.\nHere are rational bicubic patches with the control points of Figure 1 and extreme weights.\n\nEach is very close to a composite of nine bilinear tensor product patches-corresponding\nto the nine quadrilaterals in their control structures. The control points of each limiting\nbilinear patch are the corners of the corresponding quadrilateral. These are all planar\npatches on the left, while only the corner quadrilaterals are planar on the right.\nThe control structure in these examples is a regular decomposition of the 3 \u00d7 3 grid\nunderlying a bicubic patch. It is regular as it is induced from the upper convex hull of\nthe graph of a function on the 16 grid points. Such a function could be 0 at the four\ncorners, 2 at the four interior points and 1 at the remaining eight edge points. We show\nthis decomposition on the left below together with an irregular decomposition on the right.\n\n(1)\n\n(If the second decomposition were the upper convex hull of the graph of a function on the\ngrid points, and we assume-as we may-that the central square is flat, then the value of\nthe function at a vertex is lower than the values at a clockwise neighbor, which is impossible\noutside of Escher woodcuts.)\nSuch control structures and limiting patches were considered in [2], but were restricted\nto triangulations-this restriced the scope of the results. Our results hold in complete generality and like those of [2], rely upon a construction in computational algebraic geometry\ncalled a toric degeneration [7, Ch. 8.3.1].\nWhile our primary interest is to explain the meaning of control nets for the classical\nrational tensor product patches and rational B\u00e9zier triangles, we work in the generality of\nKrasauskas' toric B\u00e9zier patches [11, 12]. The reason for this is simple-any polygon may\n\n\fTORIC DEGENERATIONS OF B\u00c9ZIER PATCHES\n\n3\n\narise in a regular decomposition of the points underlying a classical patch. On the left below\nis a regular decomposition of the points in the 2 \u00d7 2 grid underlying a biquadratic patch\nand on the right is a degenerate patch, which consists of four triangles and Krasauskas's\ndouble pillow. The pillow corresponds to the central quadrilateral in the 2 \u00d7 2 grid, with\nthe 'free' internal control point corresponding to the center point of the grid.\n\n(2)\n\nWhile our primary interest is in surface patches, our definitions and arguments make\nsense in any dimension. Our discussion will concern surface patches but the proofs in the\nappendix will be given for patches of any dimension.\nWe remark that we do not address the variation diminishing property, which is another\nfundamental global aspect of the control polygon of a rational B\u00e9zier curve. This states\nthat the total variation of a B\u00e9zier curve is bounded by the total variation in the control\npolygon. Generalizing this to surfaces is important and interesting, but we currently do\nnot know how to formulate variation diminishing for general toric patches.\nThis note is organized as follows. We first recall basics of rational B\u00e9zier triangles and\nrational tensor product patches and their control nets. Next, we present Krasauskas' toric\nB\u00e9zier patches and introduce the crucial notion of a regular polyhedral decomposition. In\nthe last section we define the main object in this paper, a regular control surface, which\nis a union of toric B\u00e9zier patches governed by a regular decomposition. We also state our\ntwo main theorems, Theorem 5.1, that regular control surfaces are limits of toric B\u00e9zier\npatches, and Theorem 5.2, that if a patch is sufficiently close to a control surface, then\nthat control surface must be regular. Proofs appear in the appendix, where we work in\nthe generality of toric patches in arbitrary dimension. Our main tools are results of [9, 10]\nwhich identify all possible toric degenerations of a projective toric variety.\n2. B\u00e9zier patches and control nets\nWe define rational B\u00e9zier curves and surfaces and tensor product patches in a form that\nis convenient for our discussion, and then describe their control nets. Our presentation\ndiffers from the standard formulation [5] in that the degree is encoded by the domain. This\nlinear reparametrization does not affect the resulting curve or surface. Write R\u2265 for the\nnonnegative real numbers and R> for the positive real numbers.\nLet d be a positive integer. For each i = 0, . . . , d define the Bernstein polynomial \u03b2i;d (x),\n\u03b2i;d (x) := xi (d \u2212 x)d\u2212i .\n\u0001\n(Substituting x = dy and multiplying by di d\u2212d for normalization, this becomes the usual\nBernstein polynomial. This nonstandard presentation, omitting the binomial coefficients,\n\n\f4\n\nL. GARC\u00cdA-PUENTE, F. SOTTILE, AND C-G. ZHU\n\nstresses the separate role of functions and weights.) Given weights w0 , . . . , wd \u2208 R> and\ncontrol points b0 , . . . , bd \u2208 Rn (n = 2, 3), we have the parameterized rational B\u00e9zier curve\nPd\nwi bi \u03b2i;d (x)\n: [0, d] \u2212\u2192 Rn .\nF (x) := Pi=0\nd\ni=0 wi \u03b2i;d (x)\n\nOur domain is [0, d] rather than [0, 1], for this is the natural convention for toric patches.\nThe control polygon of the curve is the union of segments b0 , b1 , . . . , bd\u22121 , bd . Here are\ntwo rational cubic B\u00e9zier planar curves with their control polygons.\nb1\nb2\n\nb2\nb1\n\n(3)\n\nb0\nb3\nb0\nb3\nThere are two standard ways to extend this to surfaces. The most straightforward gives\nrational tensor product patches. Let c, d be positive integers and for each i = 0, . . . , c and\nj = 0, . . . , d let w(i,j) \u2208 R> and b(i,j) \u2208 R3 be a weight and a control point. The associated\nrational tensor product patch of bidegree (c, d) is the image of the map [0, c] \u00d7 [0, d] \u2192 R3 ,\nPc Pd\nj=0 w(i,j) b(i,j) \u03b2i;c (x)\u03b2j;d (y)\ni=0\n.\nF (x, y) :=\nPc Pd\nw\n\u03b2\n(x)\u03b2\n(y)\n(i,j)\ni;c\nj;d\nj=0\ni=0\n\nTriangular B\u00e9zier patches are another extension. Set\nd\n\n:= {(x, y) \u2208 R2 | 0 \u2264 x, y and x + y \u2264 d}\n\nand set A := d \u2229 Z2 , the points with integer coordinates (lattice points) in the triangle\nd . For (i, j) \u2208 A, we have the bivariate Bernstein polynomial\n\u03b2(i,j);d (x, y) := xi y j (d \u2212 x \u2212 y)d\u2212i\u2212j .\nGiven weights w = {w(i,j) | (i, j) \u2208 A} and control points B = {b(i,j) | (i, j) \u2208 A}, the\nassociated triangular rational B\u00e9zier patch is the image of the map d \u2192 R3 ,\nP\n(i,j)\u2208A w(i,j) b(i,j) \u03b2(i,j);d (x, y)\nP\n.\nF (x, y) :=:\n(i,j)\u2208A w(i,j) \u03b2(i,j);d (x, y)\n\nThe control points of a B\u00e9zier curve are naturally connected in sequence to give the\ncontrol polygon, which is a piecewise linear caricature of the curve. For a surface patch\nthere are however many ways to interpolate the control points by edges to form a control\nnet. There also may not be a way to fill in these edges with polygons to form a polytope.\nEven when this is possible, the significance of this structure for the shape of the patch is\nnot evident, except in special cases. For example, if the control points are the graph of a\nconvex function over the lattice points, then the patch is convex [3, 4]. For such control\npoints, the obvious net consists of the upward-pointing facets of the convex hull of the\ngraph. This is the net of the bicubic patches in Figure 1.\n\n\fTORIC DEGENERATIONS OF B\u00c9ZIER PATCHES\n\n5\n\n3. Toric patches and toric varieties\nKrasauskas's toric patches [11] are a natural extension of rational B\u00e9zier triangles and\nrational tensor product patches to arbitrary polygons whose vertices have integer coordinates, called lattice polygons. They are based on toric varieties [1, 6] from algebraic\ngeometry which get their name as they are natural compactifications of algebraic tori\n(C\u2217 )n , where C\u2217 := C \\ {0}. They are naturally associated to lattice polygons (and in\nhigher dimensions, lattice polytopes), and the positive real part [6, Ch. 4] [14] of a toric\nvariety is canonically identified with the corresponding polygon/polytope.\nToric patches begin with a finite set A \u2282 Z2 of (integer) lattice points. The convex hull\nof A is the set of all convex combinations\nX\nX\npa a\nwhere\npa \u2265 0\nand\n1 =\npa\na\u2208A\n\na\u2208A\n\nof points of A, which is a lattice polygon and is written \u2206A . To each edge e of \u2206A , there\nis a valid inequality he (x, y) \u2265 0 on \u2206A , where he (x, y) is a linear polynomial with integer\ncoefficients having no common integer factors that vanishes on the edge e. For example, if\nA = d \u2229 Z2 , then \u2206A = d and the inequalities are\nx \u2265 0,\n\ny \u2265 0,\n\nand d\u2212x\u2212y \u2265 0.\n\nFor another example, the central quadrilateral of (2) has inequalities\nx+y\u22121 \u2265 0, 1+x\u2212y \u2265 0, 3\u2212x\u2212y \u2265 0, and 1+y\u2212x \u2265 0.\nLet E be the set of edges of the polygon \u2206A . To each lattice point a \u2208 A, define the toric\nbasis function \u03b2a,A : \u2206A \u2192 R to be\nY\n\u03b2a,A(x, y) :=\nhe (x, y)he(a) .\ne\u2208E\n\nThis is strictly positive in the interior of \u2206A . If a lies on an edge e of \u2206A , then \u03b2a,A is\nstrictly positive on the relative interior of e, and if a is a vertex, then \u03b2a,A (a) > 0. In\nparticular the toric basis functions have no common zeroes in \u2206A .\nObserve that the toric basis functions for A = [0, c] \u00d7 [0, d] \u2229 Z2 and A = d \u2229 Z2\nare equal to the Bernstein polynomials \u03b2i;c (x)\u03b2j;d (y) and \u03b2(i,j);d (x, y) underlying the tensor\nproduct and triangular B\u00e9zier patches.\nToric patch also require weights and control points. Let #A be the number of points in\n#A\nA. Let RA\n> be R> with coordinates (za \u2208 R> | a \u2208 A) indexed by elements of A. A toric\nB\u00e9zier patch of shape A is given by a collection of positive weights w = (wa | a \u2208 A) \u2208 RA\n>\nand control points B = {ba | a \u2208 A} \u2282 R3 . These define a map \u2206A \u2192 R3 ,\nP\na\u2208A wa ba \u03b2a,A (x, y)\n.\n(4)\nFA,w,B (x, y) := P\na\u2208A wa \u03b2a,A (x, y)\nSince the toric basis functions are nonnegative on \u2206A and have no common zeroes, this\ndenominator is strictly positive on \u2206A . Write YA,w,B for the image of \u2206A under the map\nF , which is a toric B\u00e9zier patch of shape A.\nThe map F : \u2206A \u2192 R3 admits a factorization\n\n(5)\n\n\u03b2\n\nA\nF : \u2206A \u2212\u2212\u2212\n\u2192\n\nA\n\nw*\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nA\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u2212\u2212B\u2192 R3 ,\n\n\f6\n\nL.

The purpose\nof this factorization is to clarify the role of the weights in a toric patch by isolating their\nA\neffect. The image \u03b2A (\u2206A ) \u2282\nis a standard toric variety XA . Acting on this by the\nmap w* gives a translated toric variety XA,w , which we call a lift of the patch YA,w,B as\nits image under the projection \u03c0B is YA,w,B . We use results on the limiting position of the\ntranslates XA,w as the weights are allowed to vary, which are called toric degenerations.\n#A\nWe make this precise. Let RA\n\u2265 be R\u2265 with coordinates (za \u2208 R\u2265 | a \u2208 A) indexed by\nelements of A. The standard simplex\nP\nA\n:= {z \u2208 RA\n\u2265 |\na\u2208A za = 1}\n\nis the convex hull of the standard basis in RA .

Elements a of Z2 are exponents of monomials,\n\na = (a, b) \u2190\u2192 xa y b ,\nwhich we will write as xa . The points of A define a map \u03c6A : R2> \u2192\n\nA\n\nby\n\n\u03c6A (x, y) := [xa | a \u2208 A] .\nThe closure in A of the image of \u03c6A is the toric variety XA . We have the following result\nof Krasauskas [11].\nProposition 3.1. The image of \u2206A under the map \u03b2A is the toric variety XA .\nToric patches share with rational B\u00e9zier patches the following recursive structure. If a\nis a vertex of \u2206A , then ba = FA,w,B (a) is a point in the patch. If e is the edge between two\nvertices of \u2206A , then the restriction FA,w,B |e of FA,w,B to e is the 1-dimensional toric patch\ngiven by the points of A lying on e and the corresponding weights, which is a rational\nB\u00e9zier curve. For example, the edges of the rational bicubic patches in Figure 1 are all\nrational cubic B\u00e9zier curves.\n\n\fTORIC DEGENERATIONS OF B\u00c9ZIER PATCHES\n\n7\n\n4. Regular polyhedral decompositions\nWe recall the definitions of regular (or coherent) polyhedral subdivisions from geometric\ncombinatorics, which were introduced in [7, \u00a7 7.2]. Because subdivision has a different\nmeaning in modeling, we instead use the term decomposition. Let A \u2282 R2 be a finite set\nand suppose that \u03bb : A \u2192 R is a function. We use \u03bb to lift the points of A into R3 . Let\nP\u03bb be the convex hull of the lifted points,\nP\u03bb = conv{(a, \u03bb(a)) | a \u2208 A} \u2282 R3 .\nEach face of P\u03bb has an outward pointing normal vector, and its upper facets are those\nwhose normal has positive last coordinate. If we project these upper facets back to R2 ,\nthey cover the polygon \u2206A and are the facets of the regular polyhedral decomposition T\u03bb\nof \u2206A induced by \u03bb. (Lower facets also induce a regular polyhedral subdivision, which\nequals T\u2212\u03bb , and so it is no loss of generality to work with upper facets.)\nThe edges and vertices of T\u03bb are the images of the edges and vertices lying on upper\nfacets. Here are the upper facets and regular polyhedral decompositions given by two\ndifferent lifting functions for the points A underlying a biquadratic tensor product patch.\n\nMore generally, a polyhedral decomposition of \u2206A is a collection T of polygons, line\nsegments, and points of A, whose union is \u2206A , where any edge, vertex, or endpoint of\na segment also lies in T , and any two elements of T are either disjoint or their intersection\nis an element of T . A decomposition T is regular if it is induced from a lifting function.\nA decomposition S of the configuration A of points is a collection S of subsets of A\ncalled faces. The convex hulls of these faces are required to be the polygons, line segments,\nand vertices of a polyhedral decomposition T (S) of \u2206A . In particular, the intersection of\nany face with the convex hull \u2206F of another face F of S is either empty, a vertex of \u2206F ,\nor the points of F lying in some edge of \u2206F . A face F is a facet, edge, or vertex of S as\nits convex hull \u2206F is a polygon, line segment, or vertex. The decomposition S is regular\nif the polyhedral decomposition T (S) is regular.\nBelow are two different lifting functions that induce the same regular polyhedral decomposition of the 2 \u00d7 2 square underlying a biquadratic patch, but different regular\n\n\f8\n\nL.

Let \u03bb take the values {0, 1, 2, 0} on the points\n{0, 1, 2, 3} underlying rational cubic B\u00e9zier curves. This induces a regular decomposition\nof {0, 1, 2, 3} with facets\n{0, 1, 2}\n\n(7)\n\n{2, 3} .\n\nand\n\n5. Regular control surfaces\nRegular control surfaces are possible limiting positions of patches. We first illustrate\nthese notions on a rational cubic curve in the plane. The curves of (3) have weights\n(1, 4, 4, 1) on the Bernstein polynomials \u03b20;3 , \u03b21;3 , \u03b22;3 , \u03b23;3 , respectively. The lifting function\ninducing the decomposition (7) gives a family of weights (1, 4t, 4t2 , 1) as t \u2208 R> varies.\nWhen t = 5, and we use the control points of (3), we get the following curves.\nb1\nb2\nb2\n\nb1\n\n(8)\n\nb0\nb3\nb0\nb3\nTo consider the limit as t \u2192 \u221e, write the Bernstein polynomials in homogeneous form as\n\u03b2i;3 := ui v 3\u2212i for i = 0, . . . , 3, for then the cubic curve is the image of points (u, v) \u2208 (R> )2 .\nLimiting positions are given by restrictions to the facets of the decomposition (7). Multiplying the \u03b2i;3 by the weights and restricting to each facet, we get basis functions\n{v 3 , 4tv 2 u, 4t2vu2 } ,\n\nand\n\n{4t2 vu2, u3 } .\n\nThese give rational B\u00e9zier curves\nv 3 b0 + 4tv 2 ub1 + 4t2 vu2b2\n4t2 vu2 b2 + u3 b3\nand\n.\nv 3 + 4tv 2 u + 4t2 vu2\n4t2 vu2 + u3\nDividing out the common factor of v from the first and replacing tu by u, and similarly\ndividing out u2 from the second and replacing vt2 by v, we get\nv 2 b0 + 4vub1 + 4u2 b2\nv 2 + 4vu + 4u2\n\nand\n\n4vb2 + ub3\n,\n4v + u\n\n\fTORIC DEGENERATIONS OF B\u00c9ZIER PATCHES\n\n9\n\nwhich are rational quadratic and linear B\u00e9zier curves.

We may use the weights w and control\npoints B indexed by elements of a facet F as weights and control points for a toric patch\nof shape F , written YF ,w|F ,B|F . In fact, this can be done for any face of S. The union\n\nYA,w,B (S) :=\n\n[\n\nYF ,w|F ,B|F ,\n\nF \u2208S\n\nof these patches is the control surface induced by the decomposition S. As the domain of\na patch of shape F is the convex hull \u2206F of F and faces of toric patches are again toric\npatches, the control surface of a patch induced by a decomposition is naturally a C 0 spline\nsurface. A control surface YA,w,B (S) is regular if the decomposition S is regular.\nHere are the control surfaces of the bicubic patches from Figure 1.\n\nThese control surfaces are regular as they are induced by the 3 \u00d7 3 grid, which is a regular\ndecomposition.

Two\nsubsets X and Y of R3 are within Hausdorff distance \u01eb if for every point x of X there is\nsome point y of Y within a distance \u01eb of x, and vice-versa.

The key idea is the factorization (5) of the\nmap FA,w,B,\u03bb(x; t) through the simplex A .

We show how work of Kapranov, Sturmfels, and Zelevinsky [9, 10] implies that the\nset of all translated toric varieties is naturally compactified by the set of all regular control\nsurfaces in A .

While both\nrequire more algebraic geometry than we have assumed so far, Appendix A is more elementary and Appendix B is significantly more sophisticated.\nAppendix A. Proof of Theorem 5.1\nLet d, n be positive integers. The definitions and results of Sections 3, 4, and 5, as well\nas the statements of Theorems 5.1 and 5.2 make sense if we replace A \u2282 Z2 by A \u2282 Zd\nand B \u2282 R3 by B \u2282 Rn . We work here in this generality. This requires straightforward\nmodifications such as replacing polygon by polytope and in general removing restrictions\non dimension. We invite the reader to consult [2] for a more complete treatment.\nA\nIf the control points B are the vertices {ea | a \u2208 A} \u2282 RA of the simplex\n, then the\ntoric patch YA,w,B is the (translated) toric variety XA,w . Given a decomposition S of A,\nwrite XA,w (S) for the control surface induced by S when the control points are the vertices\nA\nof\n. This is the union of patches XF ,w|F over all faces F of S, and each patch XF ,w|F\nF\nlies in the face\nof A consisting of points z whose coordinates za vanish for a 6\u2208 F .\nThen, given any control points B \u2282 Rn , we have\n\u03c0B (XA,w ) = YA,w,B\n\nand\n\n\u03c0B (XA,w (S)) = YA,w,B (S) .\n\nBecause of this universality of XA,w , XA,w (S), and the map \u03c0B , it suffices to prove Theorem 5.1 for limits of the toric variety XA,w .

As every component of a point z \u2208 A and weight w is nonnegative, we\nmay take arbitrary (positive) roots of the equations in Proposition A.2.

This is a special and\nreal-number case of more general results of Kapranov, Sturmfels, and Zelevinsky [9, 10]\nconcerning all possible toric degenerations of the complexified toric variety XA (C) that we\nwill use to prove Theorem 5.2.\nSuppose the A \u2282 Zd is a finite set of integer lattice points. We will assume that A is\nprimitive in that differences of elements of A span Zd :\nZd = Zha \u2212 a\u2032 | a, a\u2032 \u2208 Ai ,\nthat is, A affinely spans Zd (if not, then simply replace Zd by the affine span of A). Let\nPA be the complex projective space with homogeneous coordinates [za | a \u2208 A] indexed\nby elements of A. (These are extensions to all of PA of the homogeneous coordinates (6),\nwhich were valid for the nonnegative part of PA .) The complex torus H := (C\u2217 )d naturally\nacts on PA with weights given by the set A: t \u2208 H sends the point z with homogenous\ncoordinates [za | a \u2208 A] to the point t.z := [ta za | a \u2208 A]. Note that XA,1 (C) is the\nclosure of the orbit of H through the point 1 := [1 : . . . : 1]. For w \u2208 (C\u2217 )A , the translate\nw.XA,1 (C) =: XA,w (C) is also the closure of the orbit of H through the point w (considered\nA\nas a point in PA ). Note that\nis the nonnegative real part [6, Ch. 4] of PA , and when\n\u2217 A\nw \u2208 RA\n> \u2282 (C ) , then XA,w is the nonnegative real part of XA,w (C).\nA toric degeneration of XA,1 (C) is any translate XA,w (C), or any limit of translates\nlim \u03bb(t).XA,w (C)\nt\u21920\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2217 A\n\nwhere \u03bb : C \u2192 (C ) is a one-parameter subgroup. This limit is the same limit as in\nSection A, its ideal is the limit of the ideals of \u03bb(t).XA,w (C) as t \u2192 0. We remark that the\ndata of a one-parameter subgroup of (C\u2217 )A are equivalent to homomorphisms of abelian\ngroups ZA \u2192 Z and thus to functions \u03bb : A \u2192 Z, which explains our notation \u03bb.\nThe translates XA,w (C) for w \u2208 (C\u2217 )A give a family of subvarieties of PA , each with the\nsame dimension and degree, and each equipped with an action of H. A main result of [9, 10]\nidentifies all suitable limits of these translates XA,w (C) with the points of a complex projective toric variety CA (C). The points of CA (C) in turn are in one-to-one correspondence\nwith all possible complex toric degenerations of XA,w (C) as w ranges over (C\u2217 )A . For a\ntoric degeneration X of a translate of XA,1 (C), we write [X] for the corresponding point\nof CA (C). We will use this result to prove Theorem 5.2 as follows.\nProof of Theorem 5.2. Fix control points B = {ba | a \u2208 A} \u2282 Rn and suppose that\n{w 1, w 2 , . . . } is a sequence of weights in RA\n> such that the sequence of toric patches {YA,w i ,B |\ni = 1, 2, . . . } converges to a set Y in Rn in the Hausdorff topology.\nConsider the corresponding sequence {XA,wi (C) | i = 1, 2, . . . } of torus translates of\nXA (C). This gives a sequence [XA,wi (C)] of points in the projective toric variety CA (C).\nSince CA (C) is compact, this sequence of points has a convergent subsequence whose limit\n\n\f18\n\nL. GARC\u00cdA-PUENTE, F. SOTTILE, AND C-G. ZHU\n\npoint is a toric degeneration\nlim XA,w\u03bb (t) (C) = XA,w (S\u03bb )(C) =\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\n[\n\nXF ,w|F (C)\n\nF \u2208S\u03bb\n\nof XA,w (C) for some w \u2208 (C\u2217 )A and lifting function \u03bb : ZA \u2192 Z. Replacing the original\nweights {w i } by this subsequence, we may assume that, as points of CA (C), we have\n(21)\n\nlim [XA,wi (C)] = [XA,w (S\u03bb )(C)] = lim [XA,w\u03bb (t) (C)] .\nt\u2192\u221e\n\ni\u2192\u221e\n\nThe points [XA,wi (C)] of CA (C) are translates of the base point [XA (C)] by elements of\n\u2217 A\nRA\n> \u2282 (C ) , and so they lie in the nonnegative real part of the toric variety CA (C), and\ntherefore so does their limit point. But by (21) this limit point is a translate of XA (S\u03bb )(C),\nand thus it is a translate by a real weight. This shows that we may take the weight w\nin (21) to be real.\nTheorem 5.2 will follow from this and the claim that if a sequence {[Xi ] | i \u2208 N} \u2282 CA (C)\nconverges to a point [X] of CA (C) in the (usual) analytic topology, then the sequence of\ncorresponding subvarieties {Xi } converges to X in the Hausdorff metric on subsets of PA .\nGiven this claim, (21) implies that in the Hausdorff topology on subsets of PA ,\nlim XA,wi (C) = lim XA,w\u03bb (t) (C) = XA,w (S\u03bb )(C) .\nt\u2192\u221e\n\ni\u2192\u221e\n\nWe may restrict this to their real points to conclude that the limit of patches XA,wi in\nA\n,\nlim XA,wi = lim XA,w\u03bb (t) = XA,w (S\u03bb ) ,\ni\u2192\u221e\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nis a regular control surface. Since YA,wi,B = \u03c0B (XA,wi ), the limit limi\u2192\u221e YA,wi ,B equals\n\u0001\n\u0001\nlim \u03c0B (XA,wi ) = \u03c0B lim XA,wi = \u03c0B XA,w (S\u03bb ) = YA,w,B (S\u03bb ) ,\ni\u2192\u221e\n\ni\u2192\u221e\n\nwhich is a regular control surface. This will complete the proof of Theorem 5.2, once we\nhave proven the claim.\n\u0003\n\nProof of claim. As shown in [9, 10], the projective toric variety CA (C) is the Chow quotient\nof PA by the group H = (C\u2217 )d acting via the weights of A. We explain this construction.\nLet D = d! * volume(\u2206A ), which is the degree of the projective toric variety XA (C), as well\nas any of its translates. Basic algebraic geometry (see [8, Lect. 21]) gives us the existence\nof a complex projective variety C(D, d, A), called the Chow variety, whose points are in\none-to-one correspondence with d-dimensional cycles in PA of degree D. These are formal\nlinear combinations\nm\nX\nDj Z j\n(22)\nZ :=\ni=1\n\nwhere each coefficient Dj is a nonnegative integer, each Zj is a reduced and irreducible\nsubvariety of PA of dimension d, and we have\nm\nX\nD =\nDj * degree(Zj ) .\nj=1\n\nIn particular all translates XA,w (C) are represented by points of C(D, d, A).\n\n\fTORIC DEGENERATIONS OF B\u00c9ZIER PATCHES\n\n19\n\nThe torus (C\u2217 )A (in fact (C\u2217 )A /H) acts on PA and thus on C(D, d, A), with the points\nrepresenting the translates XA,w forming a single orbit. The Chow quotient CA (C) is the\nclosure of this orbit in C(D, d, A). An explicit description of CA (C) in terms of a quotient\nfan or the secondary polytope of A is more subtle and may be found in [9, 10]. We do not\nneed this description to prove Theorem 5.2, although such a description could be used to\nhelp identify the limit control surface whose existence is only asserted by Theorem 5.2.\nThe points of CA (C) correspond to toric degenerations of translates XA,w (C). We describe this, associating a cycle of degree D and dimension d to any toric degeneration. Let\n\u03bb : ZA \u2192 Z be any lifting function with corresponding regular decomposition S\u03bb of A. Let\nF \u2282 A be a facet of S\u03bb . Set \u03b4F to be the index in Zd of the lattice\nZhf \u2212 f \u2032 | f, f \u2032 \u2208 F i\nspanned by differences of elements of F . Then XF ,w|F (C) is a subvariety of PF of dimension\nd and degree\nd! * volume(\u2206F )/\u03b4F .\nThe toric degeneration\nlim XA,w\u03bb (t) (C) =\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nF\n\n[\n\na facet of\n\nXF ,w|F (C)\nS\u03bb\n\n(this is a set-theoretic limit) corresponds to the cycle\nX\n\u03b4F XF ,w|F (C) ,\nF a facet of S\u03bb\nwhich has degree D = d! * volume(\u2206A ).\nWe now prove the claim. Following Lawson [13, Sect. 2], Kapranov, Sturmfels, and\nR\nZelevinsky [9, Sect. 1] associate to a cycle (22) a current on PA -the linear functional Z\nof integrating a smooth 2d-form over the cycle Z. The analytic topology on the Chow\nvariety is equivalent to the weak topology on currents. (The weak topology is the topology\nof pointwise convergence: A sequence {\u03c8i | i \u2208 N} of currents converges to a current \u03c8 if\nand only if for every 2d-form \u03c9 on PA we have limi\u2192\u221e \u03c8i (\u03c9) = \u03c8(\u03c9), as complex numbers.)\nSuppose that {[Xi ]} \u2282 CA (C) is a convergent sequence of points in the usual analytic\ntopology on CA (C), with limit point [X],\nlim [Xi ] = [X] .\n\ni\u2192\u221e\n\nThen the associated currents converge. That is, for every smooth 2d-form \u03c9, we have\nZ\nZ\n(23)\nlim\n\u03c9 =\n\u03c9.\ni\u2192\u221e\n\nXi\n\nX\n\nWe use this to show that limi\u2192\u221e Xi = X, in the Hausdorff metric.\nR\nGiven a point x \u2208 X and a number \u01eb > 0, let \u03c9 be a 2d-form with X \u03c9 6= 0 which\nvanishes outside the ball B(x, \u01eb) of radius\n\u01eb around x. Then (23) implies that there is a\nR\nnumber M such that if i > M, then Xi \u03c9 6= 0, and thus Xi \u2229 B(x, \u01eb) 6= \u2205. Since X is\ncompact, there is some number M such that if i > M, then every point of X is within a\ndistance \u01eb of a point of Xi .\n\n\f20\n\nL. GARC\u00cdA-PUENTE, F. SOTTILE, AND C-G. ZHU\n\nTo complete the proof of the claim, we need to show that for every number \u01eb > 0, there\nis a number M such that if i > M, then every point of Xi lies within a distance \u01eb of\nX. Suppose that this is not true. That is, there is a number \u01eb > 0 such that for every\nnumber M, there is some i > M such that Xi has a point whose distance from X exceeds\n\u01eb. Replacing {Xi } by a subsequence, we may assume that each Xi has a point xi whose\ndistance from X exceeds \u01eb. It is no loss to assume that the points xi are smooth. By the\ncompactness of PA and of the Grassmannian of d-dimensional linear subspaces of PA , we\nmay replace {Xi } by a subsequence and assume that the points xi converge to a point x,\nand that the tangent spaces Txi Xi also converge to a linear\nR space L. It follows that there\nis a 2d-form \u03c9 which vanishes outside of B(x, \u01eb/2) and L \u03c9 6= 0. By our assumption on\nthe sequence of tangent spaces Txi Xi , we will have\nZ\n\u03c9 6= 0 .\nlim\ni\u2192\u221e\n\nXi\n\nR\n\nBut then (23) implies that X \u03c9 6= 0, and so X \u2229 B(x, \u01eb/2) 6= \u2205, which contradicts our\nassumption that X is the limit the spaces Xi .\nThis completes our proof of the claim, and therefore of Theorem 5.2.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] David Cox, John Little, and Hal Schenck, Toric varieties, Graduate Studies in Mathematics, American\nMathematical Society, 2011.\n[2] Gheorghe Craciun, Luis Garc\u0131\u0301a-Puente, and Frank Sottile, Some geometrical aspects of control points\nfor toric patches, Mathematical Methods for Curves and Surfaces, Lecture Notes in Computer Science,\nvol. 5862, Springer, 2010, pp. 111\u2013135.\n[3] Wolfgang Dahmen, Convexity and Bernstein-B\u00e9zier polynomials, Curves and surfaces (ChamonixMont-Blanc, 1990), Academic Press, Boston, MA, 1991, pp. 107\u2013134.\n[4] Wolfgang Dahmen and Charles A.
