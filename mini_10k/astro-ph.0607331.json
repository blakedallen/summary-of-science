The discovery of extended high opacity regions in the absorption\nspectra of z >\n\u223c 6 quasars has provoked an intense discussion as to whether or not the tail end of the reionization\nepoch has been detected. Following the three year WMAP\nresults, the complementary constraints on the start and\nduration of the reionization epoch from cosmic microwave\nbackground data are now actually very weak (Page et al.\n2006; Spergel et al. 2006). An extended period of reionization starting at z \u223c 15 and a rather rapid reionization\naround z \u223c 6 both appear to be consistent with the data.\nMuch hope for further progress is based on upcoming experiments to detect high-redshift 21 cm emission/absorption\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail:jsb@ast.cam.ac.uk\n\u2020 E-mail:haehnelt@ast.cam.ac.uk\nc 0000 RAS\n\n(Scott & Rees 1990; Madau et al. 1997; Shaver et al. 1999;\nTozzi et al. 2000). Currently, however, the study of Lyman series absorption in the spectra of quasars (Fan et al.\n2002, 2006b) and gamma-ray bursts (Ciardi & Loeb 2000;\nBarkana & Loeb 2004; Totani et al. 2006) are the key observational probe of the hydrogen reionization epoch. The\nabsence of a Gunn-Peterson trough (Gunn & Peterson 1965)\nin quasar spectra at z < 5.5 shows unambiguously that the\nvolume weighted neutral hydrogen fraction in the intergalactic medium (IGM) is less than one part in 104 (Fan et al.\n2002, 2006b). Hydrogen reionization is therefore definitely\ncomplete at this time. However, at z \u2243 6 the detection\nof dark absorption troughs in quasar spectra indicates the\nIGM neutral hydrogen fraction is increasing rapidly with\nlook back time (Djorgovski et al. 2001; Becker et al. 2001;\nSongaila & Cowie 2002; Pentericci et al. 2002; White et al.\n2003; Fan et al. 2006b). Whether a large fraction of the volume is still neutral at this time is, however, rather controversial. Fan et al. (2006b) obtain a lower limit on the vol-\n\n\f2\n\nJ.S. Bolton & M.G. Haehnelt\n\nume weighted neutral hydrogen fraction of fHI \u2265 10\u22123.5 at\nz \u2265 6 from a detailed analysis of the Lyman series absorption in quasar spectra. There are also claims for an acceleration in the upwards evolution of the Ly\u03b1 optical depth at\nz \u2243 6 (Cen & McDonald 2002; Fan et al. 2002; White et al.\n2003; Fan et al. 2006b) which may occur during the epoch\nwhen individual H II regions overlap (Gnedin 2000, 2004).\nOther authors, however, argue that the data is consistent\nwith a smooth evolution due to the gradual thickening of the\nLy\u03b1 forest (Songaila 2004; Becker et al. 2006). Large variations in the transmitted flux along different lines-of-sight\nfurther complicate the picture. Large Lyman series troughs\nare detected in several quasar spectra at z \u2243 6 (Fan et al.\n2006b). Yet the spectrum of J1148 + 5251 at z = 6.42 exhibits patchy transmission, indicating the IGM is highly\nionized in at least some locations (White et al. 2003, 2005;\nOh & Furlanetto 2005). This may be indicative of spatial\nfluctuations in the UV background which are expected at the\nend of reionization (Wyithe & Loeb 2006; Fan et al. 2006b),\nbut may also be attributed to the fluctuations of the IGM\ndensity alone (Lidz et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2006). It is thus\ncurrently unclear whether the IGM is highly ionized, substantially neutral or indeed a combination of both just above\nz = 6, depending on the line-of-sight considered. Answering\nthis question conclusively will have important implications\nfor the nature of hydrogen reionization.\nThe main limitation of Lyman series absorption as a\nprobe of the IGM neutral hydrogen fraction is it ceases to\n\u22123\nbe sensitive at fHI >\n\u223c 10 . Other approaches to probing the\nIGM neutral hydrogen fraction at z \u2265 6 include analysing\nmetal absorption systems (Oh 2002; Furlanetto & Loeb\n2003; Becker et al. 2006b), the luminosity function of\nLy\u03b1 emitting galaxies (Malhotra & Rhoads 2004; Hu et al.\n2005; Kashikawa et al. 2006), and the dark gap width distribution (Paschos & Norman 2005; Gallerani et al. 2006) although all have their associated interpretative uncertainties\n(see Fan et al. 2006a for an recent review of results from all\nthese techniques).\nIn this work we shall concentrate on yet another probe\nof the neutral hydrogen fraction of the high-redshift IGM.\nRecently, claims that the IGM has a large neutral hydrogen\nfraction at z > 6 have been made based on the observed\nsizes of the small regions of transmitted flux observed in\nquasar absorption spectra just blue-ward of the quasar's\nredshift (Wyithe & Loeb 2004; Mesinger & Haiman 2004;\nMesinger et al. 2004; Wyithe et al. 2005; Yu & Lu 2005). In\nthe regions close to the quasar intergalactic hydrogen is expected to be highly ionized. The typical sizes of these regions\nobserved in Ly\u03b1 absorption at z \u2243 6 are 5 \u2212 10 proper Mpc\n(Fan et al. 2006b). Throughout this paper we shall refer to\nthese regions as near-zones. This accounts for the possibility\nthat these regions may be either the observational signature\nof quasar H II ionization fronts expanding into a significantly\nneutral IGM, or classical proximity zones due to enhanced\nionizing flux near the quasar (Bajtlik et al. 1988).\nWyithe et al. (2005) use the size of spectroscopically\nidentified near-zones observed around seven quasars at 6 \u2264\nz \u2264 6.42 to infer fHI \u2265 0.1. An alternative analysis by\nMesinger & Haiman (2004) uses the difference between the\nsizes of the near-zones identified in the Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 regions of the spectrum of a single quasar at z = 6.28 to\nobtain fHI \u2265 0.2. They attribute the slightly smaller size\n\nof the Ly\u03b1 near-zone to the presence of a damping wing\nfrom a significantly neutral IGM (Miralda-Escud\u00e9 & Rees\n1998; Miralda-Escud\u00e9 1998). If these results are correct, they\nwould imply a very rapid increase in the neutral hydrogen\nfraction over a short redshift interval, from fHI \u223c 10\u22124 at\nz = 5.5 to fHI \u2265 10\u22121 at z \u223c 6.4. In contrast, by comparing the relative sizes of Ly\u03b1 near-zones observed around 16\nquasars, Fan et al. (2006b) conclude the IGM neutral hydrogen fraction increases by a factor of \u223c 14 assuming the\n\u22121/3\nnear-zone sizes scale as (1 + z)\u22121 fHI\nover the same redshift range. They find no strong evidence for a significantly\nneutral IGM at z = 6.4.\nThese results appear to be in direct contradiction with\neach other. However, there are a number of uncertainties\nwhich may explain the origin of these different conclusions.\nUsing the properties of spectroscopically identified nearzones to determine the IGM neutral hydrogen fraction requires assumptions about the ionizing luminosity and lifetime of quasars, as well as the density distribution of the surrounding IGM. The clumpy nature of the IGM will produce\nlarge variations in near-zone sizes from one line-of-sight to\nthe next, with the underdense regions in the IGM setting the\nobserved sizes of these regions (e.g. Oh & Furlanetto 2005).\nFurther uncertainties arise from the possibility of fainter ionizing sources clustered around the quasar and the exact details of the radiative transfer through the inhomogeneous\nIGM. The sizes of the spectroscopically identified near-zones\nthemselves are also uncertain. They are determined from\ngenerally noisy, moderate or low resolution spectra and the\nsystemic redshift of the quasar is usually not known to a high\ndegree of accuracy. It is also not immediately clear whether\nthe observed sizes of near-zones correspond to the full extent of the regions impacted by the ionizing radiation of the\nquasars (i.e. the region behind the quasar H II ionization\nfront), a key assumption when inferring the IGM neutral\nhydrogen fraction from the sizes of near-zones.\nIn this paper we investigate these issues in some detail.\nWe model highly ionized Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 near-zones around\nhigh redshift quasars using a large hydrodynamical simulation combined with an accurate scheme for radiative transfer\nthrough an inhomogeneous IGM of primordial composition.\nWe shall consider the information one may realistically infer about the ionization state of the IGM from the observed\nsizes of Lyman series near-zones. In section 2 we develop a\nsimple analytical model for the sizes of the spectroscopically\nobserved near-zones. A brief overview of our radiative transfer simulations is presented in section 3, and in section 4 we\nexamine the dependence of Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 near-zones sizes\non the IGM neutral hydrogen fraction, quasar age and ionizing photon production rate. We consider the evolution in\nLy\u03b1 near-zone sizes observed by Fan et al. (2006b) in section 5 and present our conclusions in section 6. Details of\nour radiative transfer implementation and treatment of unresolved self shielded clumps are found in the appendices.\nThroughout this paper we adopt the following set\nof cosmological parameters (\u03a9m , \u03a9\u039b , \u03a9b h2 , h, \u03c38 , n) =\n(0.26, 0.74, 0.024, 0.72, 0.85, 0.95), consistent with the combined analysis of three year WMAP and Ly\u03b1 forest data\n(Viel et al. 2006; Seljak et al. 2006), and a helium fraction\nby mass of Y = 0.24 (e.g. Olive & Skillman 2004).

Consider\nthe idealised case of an observer positioned along the line of\nsight to a monochromatic ionizing source, isotropically emitting \u1e44 Lyman limit photons per unit time into a homogeneous, pure hydrogen IGM with a volume weighted neutral\nhydrogen fraction fHI = nHI /nH . If this observer could measure the exact size of the H II region around the source at\nvarious times t during the source lifetime, the H II region\nexpansion rate would be described by (see appendix A for\ndetails)\n3\n\u03b1HII n2H\n\u1e44 \u2212 43 \u03c0Rion\ndRion\n,\n=\n2\ndt\n4\u03c0Rion fHI nH\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Rion is the distance of the H II I-front from the\nsource, \u03b1HII is the recombination coefficient for ionized hydrogen and nH is the proper hydrogen number density at\na fixed baryonic density normalised by the cosmic mean,\n\u2206 = \u03c1b /\u03c1\u0304b ,\nnH = 7.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 \u2206\n\n\u0010\n\n1+z\n7\n\n\u00113\n\ncm\u22123 .\n\n(2)\n\nFor small values of fHI the \"I-front\" obviously produces only\na very small change in the ionized hydrogen fraction within\na region of radius Rion .\nSolving equation (1) for a source with age tQ yields,\nRion = RS\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0012\n\ntQ\n1 \u2212 exp \u2212\nfHI trec\n\n\u0013\u00151/3\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere RS is the Str\u00f6mgren radius, defined as\nRS =\n\n\u0012\n\n3\u1e44\n4\u03c0\u03b1HII n2H\n\n\u00131/3\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nand trec = (nH \u03b1HII )\u22121 is the recombination timescale.

While equation (1) is a\nreasonable approximation for the expansion rate of an H II Ifront embedded in a significantly neutral IGM, it does not\npredict the residual neutral hydrogen fraction behind the\nI-front. However, the sizes of Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 near-zones observed in quasar spectra will depend on the value of the\nneutral hydrogen fraction behind the H II I-front. The value\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n3\n\nof Rion can therefore be different to the size of the near-zone\nspectroscopically identified in Lyman series absorption. For\nsmall values of fHI , Rion can be significantly larger than the\nobserved near-zone size.\n2.2\n\nA simple model for the observed sizes of\nnear-zones in Lyman series absorption\n\nThe Gunn-Peterson optical depth (Gunn & Peterson 1965)\nresulting from the scattering of redshifted Ly\u03b1 photons by a\nuniform distribution of neutral hydrogen can be written as,\n\u03c4 (z) =\n\n\u03c3\u03b1 cnH fHI\n,\nH(z)\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03c3\u03b1 = 4.48 \u00d7 10\u221218 cm2 is the scattering cross-section\nfor Ly\u03b1 photons, H(z) is the Hubble parameter and c is the\nspeed of light.\nNow consider the effect of a luminous quasar on the\nsurrounding IGM behind its H II I-front. The extent of the\nobserved near-zone in the Ly\u03b1 region of the quasar absorption spectrum, R\u03b1 , will be set by the limiting Ly\u03b1 optical\ndepth, \u03c4lim = \u2212 ln Flim , at which the observer can clearly\ndistinguish between the presence and absence of transmitted flux. However, as discussed by Fan et al. (2006b), consistently defining the boundary of a near-zone is difficult, and is\ncomplicated by fluctuations in the IGM density distribution,\nthe UV background and the low signal-to-noise and resolution of the quasar spectrum. In addition, at lower redshifts\nthe IGM has non-zero transmission outside of the near-zone,\nmaking the definition of R\u03b1 ambiguous. Fan et al. (2006b)\ndefine R\u03b1 as the extent of the region where Flim > 0.1 when\nthe quasar spectrum has been smoothed to a resolution of\n20 \u00c5. The smoothing of the somewhat noisy spectra is very\nreasonable and a common definition is obviously essential\nfor comparing observed spectra consistently. However the\nsmoothing of the spectra can result in an underestimate of\nthe estimated near-zone sizes if associated narrow transmission peaks beyond the region of continuous transmission are\nobliterated, or in an overestimate if transmission from the\nIGM ionized solely by the UV background is included. We\nshall therefore adopt a definition of R\u03b1 more suited to a\ndiscussion of the general scaling laws for near-zone sizes in\nthe absence of such practical difficulties, and will come back\nto a detailed comparison using the definition of Fan et al.\n(2006b) later. Here we do not apply any smoothing and define the edge of the near-zone simply as corresponding to\nthe last pixel at which the spectrum drops below the normalised flux detection limit of Flim = 0.1, corresponding to\nan optical depth detection limit \u03c4lim = 2.3. Note that this\ndefinition will break down when transmission from the IGM\nionized solely by the metagalactic UV background becomes\ncommon.\nRearranging equation (6) and setting \u03c4 = \u03c4lim yields the\nneutral hydrogen fraction required to reproduce the optical\ndepth detection limit,\nlim\nfHI\n\u2243 5.4 \u00d7 10\u22126 \u2206lim\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03c4lim\n2.3\n\n\u0011\u0010\n\n1 + z\u03b1\n7\n\n\u0011\u22123/2\n\n,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u2206lim is the corresponding normalised baryon density\nas fraction of the cosmic mean and z\u03b1 is the redshift of the\nLy\u03b1 near-zone boundary.

Obviously the above definition for the maximum size of the\nnear-zone obviously only makes sense if the amplitude of\nthe metagalactic UV background above the Lyman limit is\nlim\nsmaller than JHI\n. Also note the size of the observed nearzone in the Ly\u03b1 region will always be smaller than or equal\nto Rion . The important point to take from this simple argument is the different scaling of the two radii, Rion \u221d \u1e44 1/3\nmax\nand R\u03b1\n\u221d \u1e44 1/2 , with the ionizing luminosity, and that\nmax\nR\u03b1\nis independent of the neutral hydrogen fraction of the\nIGM and the lifetime of the quasar. One may also derive a\nsimilar expression for the maximum size of the observable\nLy\u03b2 near-zone,\n\nR\u03b2max \u2243 2.5\n\n\u0010 T \u00110.35 \u0010 1 + z \u0011\u22129/4\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b2\n\nT\u03b1\n\n1 + z\u03b1\n\nmax\nR\u03b1\n,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere T\u03b2 is the IGM temperature at the edge of the\nLy\u03b2 near-zone at z\u03b2 .\nEquations (11) and (12) should be considered as illustrative approximations only; radiative transfer through\na realistic IGM density distribution is required to address\nthis fully. A number of caveats should therefore be kept\nin mind. The upper limits for the near-zone sizes given by\n\nequations (11) and (12) do not take into account the possible effect of a damping wing from a significantly neutral\nIGM, which reduces the size of the Ly\u03b1 near-zone relative to\nLy\u03b2 (Mesinger & Haiman 2004). The presence of the dense,\nself-shielded clumps responsible for observed Lyman-limit\nsystems will further reduce the upper limit for the observed\nsizes of the near-zone compared to the estimates given by\nequations (11) and (12). Additionally, the overlying lower\nredshift Ly\u03b1 forest should reduce the observed size of the\nnear-zone in the Ly\u03b2 region. Note that for a predominantly\nneutral IGM, the sizes of the observed Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 nearzones will both trace the position of the H II I-front and\nshould both be given by Rion , whereas if the IGM is highly\nionized, the distinction between the near-zone and the general Ly\u03b1 forest will become highly ambiguous.\nHowever, assuming equation (11) holds, for Rion >\nmax\nR\u03b1\n(Rion > R\u03b2max ) the observed size of the Ly\u03b1 (Ly\u03b2)\nnear-zone becomes independent of the neutral fraction of\nthe surrounding IGM. The same is true if Rion = RS . The\nmax\ntimescale for the H II I-front to reach R\u03b1\nin a homogeneous IGM is approximately,\n6\n\nt \u2243 4.2 \u00d7 10 \u2206fHI\n\u00d7\n\n\u0010\n\n1+z\n7\n\n\u00113\n\n\u0012\n\nmax\nR\u03b1\n3.14 Mpc\n\n\u00133 \u0012\n\n\u1e44\n2 \u00d7 1057 s\u22121\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\nyrs\n\n(13)\n\nFor a realistic clumpy IGM in the vicinity of a quasar this\ntimescale should be longer by a factor of a few, but for\nfHI < 0.1 this is still considerably shorter than the canonical quasar lifetime of \u223c 107 yrs (Martini 2004; Hopkins et al.\n2005). The time scale for the H II I-front to reach R\u03b2max is\n\u223c 16 times longer again. The size of the Ly\u03b2 near-zone is\ntherefore potentially much more sensitive to the IGM neutral hydrogen fraction. A similar argument applies for the\nscaling of the observed near-zone sizes with quasar age.\n2.3\n\nComparison of the analytical model to\nobservational data\n\nmax\nThe solid curves in both panels of figure 1 show R\u03b1\nand\nits dependence on the number of ionizing photons emitted\nper second by the quasar, \u1e44 , using our fiducial assumptions\nof [\u03c4lim , \u03b1s , T\u03b1 , z\u03b1 ] = [2.3, 1.5, 2 \u00d7 104 K, 6] in equation (11).\nThe three curves shown are for \u2206lim = [0.4, 0.7, 1]. In the\nleft panel the series of dotted and dashed curves show Rion\ncomputed using equation (3) for fHI = [1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.1] and\na quasar lifetime of tQ = 107 yrs. In the right panel Rion is\nshown for tQ = [0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1] \u00d7 107 yrs and a fixed neutral\nfraction of fHI = 0.1. When computing Rion , \u2206 = 1 has been\nassumed, although in reality \u2206 should be slightly larger on\naverage due to the clumpy nature of the IGM. However,\nwe find this does not make any significant difference to our\nconclusions, as we shall discuss later.\nThe filled grey circles in figure 1 represent the observed\nsizes of Ly\u03b1 near-zones around quasars at 5.81 \u2264 z \u2264 6.42\nas determined by Fan et al. (2006b). In the instances where\nno Mg II redshift was available, Fan et al. (2006b) have applied a correction to the quasar redshifts of \u2206z = +0.02\nin order to take into account the systematic redshift offset of high ionization lines. Note further that, as discussed\nabove, Fan et al. (2006b) have smoothed the Ly\u03b1 spectra\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fNature and evolution of highly ionized near-zones\n\n5\n\nFigure 1.

The sizes are plotted as a function of the number of ionizing photons emitted by the quasar\nper second, \u1e44 . The solid curves in both panels give Rmax\nfor \u2206lim = [0.4, 0.7, 1.0].

The open circles with error bars are Ly\u03b1 near-zone\nsizes as determined by Wyithe et al. (2005) around a subsample of the same quasars at 6 \u2264 z \u2264 6.42, adapted from\ntheir table 1. Wyithe et al. (2005) used the Ly\u03b1 near-zone\nsizes as a proxy for the extent of the quasar H II I-front,\nand determine the extent of the near-zones to be at the\nredshifts where the transmission extending blueward of the\nLy\u03b1 emission line becomes comparable to the noise. The\nsize of Ly\u03b1 near-zone around J1030 + 0524 they quote was\nincreased to correspond to the size of the slightly larger\nLy\u03b2 near-zone observed around this quasar. We have instead adopted R\u03b1 = 4.55 \u00b1 1.65, with an error bar based on\nan uncertainty of \u2206z = 0.03 in the redshift of J1030 + 0524\n(White et al. 2003). We have also omitted J1048+4637 from\nthe Wyithe et al. (2005) sample, as this is a BAL quasar\nwhich makes a meaningful measurement of the Ly\u03b1 nearzone size difficult (X.Fan, private communication). For all\nexcept one of the quasars (J1630 + 4012, the lowest luminosity quasar) the Wyithe et al. (2005) values are consistent\nwith the corresponding determinations by Fan et al. (2006b)\nwithin the error bars shown. As discussed by Fan et al.\n(2006b) and later within this paper, the observed near-zone\nsizes evolve rather rapidly with redshift. The larger nearzone sizes within the Fan et al. (2006b) sample which are\nomitted in the Wyithe et al. (2005) data are for quasars at\nz < 6. For both data sets, the conversion from ultraviolet\nAB absolute magnitudes, M1450 , to \u1e44 has been made using\na generic broken power law spectral energy distribution,\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nL(\u03bd) \u221d\n\n\u001a\n\n\u03bd \u22120.5\n\u03bd\n\n\u22121.5\n\n(1050 < \u03bb < 1450 \u00c5),\n(\u03bb < 1050 \u00c5).\n\n(14)\n\nAll photons above 1 Ryd are considered to be ionizing photons. We have not plotted error bars for \u1e44 , although the\nvalues will be somewhat uncertain depending on the exact\nspectrum of the quasars (e.g. Yu & Lu 2005).\nAs already discussed, the observed size of the near-zone\nmax\nin the Ly\u03b1 region should be the smaller of R\u03b1\nor Rion .\nClearly from figure 1, our simple analytical argument suggests that the sizes of the observed Ly\u03b1 near-zones are consistent with both the expected extent of classical proximity zones and an H II I-front expanding into an IGM with\na significant neutral hydrogen fraction, for reasonable assumptions for the quasar ionizing luminosity and lifetime.\nThe fact that equation (3) and (11) give similar values\nmax\nfor Rion and R\u03b1\nis a coincidence which explains the discrepant interpretation of the observed sizes of near-zones\nin the literature. Taking a combination of 0.1 \u2264 fHI \u2264 1\nand 106 \u2264 tQ \u2264 107 yrs results in an H II region similar in size to the observed Ly\u03b1 near-zones, whereas equation (11) reproduces the observed sizes even for small fHI or\nlarge tQ . For example, one can reasonably adopt values of\nfHI = 10\u22123 and t = 5 \u00d7 107 yrs, within the observationally\ndetermined limits of fHI \u2265 10\u22123.5 (Fan et al. 2006b) and\n106 \u2264 tQ \u2264 108 yrs (Martini 2004). For a quasar luminosity\nof \u1e44 = 2 \u00d7 1057 s\u22121 , assuming \u2206lim = 0.4 and z\u03b1 = 6, according to equation (11) one expects to see a Ly\u03b1 near-zone\nof R\u03b1 \u2243 7.9 Mpc, consistent with observed sizes. However,\nequation (5) predicts a value of Rion \u2243 22 Mpc, much larger\nthan any observed Ly\u03b1 near-zone, although in practise this\n\n\f6\n\nJ.S. Bolton & M.G. Haehnelt\n\nwill be slightly smaller due to the clumpy nature of the IGM.\nIf the size of the observed near-zone is nevertheless identified with Rion , the inferred IGM neutral hydrogen fraction\nis erroneously large.\nTherefore, the size of individual near-zones in the\nLy\u03b1 region alone appears to offer little in terms of constraining the ionization state of the hydrogen in the surrounding\nIGM. This will be confirmed by our detailed numerical simulations including radiative transfer in section 4. However,\nas we will show, this situation improves if both the Ly\u03b1 and\nLy\u03b2 near-zones are considered in tandem.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nCREATING SYNTHETIC ABSORPTION\nSPECTRA INCLUDING NEAR-ZONES\nRadiative transfer implementation\n\nOur 1D radiative transfer implementation is based on an\nupdated version of the multi-frequency photon conserving\nalgorithm used by Bolton et al. (2004). The advantage of\nthis single ray-tracing approach is that we may run many\nradiative transfer simulations with only modest computational resources. In addition, we achieve the high spatial and\ntemporal resolution which is required to accurately determine post-reionization gas temperatures (Bolton et al. 2004;\nTittley & Meiksin 2006). Technical details and the relevant\nresolution tests can be found in appendices B and C, to\nwhich we refer the interested reader.\n\n3.2\n\nHydrodynamical simulations\n\nWe combine our radiative transfer implementation with\ncosmological density distributions drawn from a large\nhydrodynamical simulation. The hydrodynamical simulation was run using the parallel TreeSPH code GADGET-2\n(Springel 2005). The simulation volume is a periodic box\n60h\u22121 comoving Mpc in length and contains 2 \u00d7 4003\ngas and dark matter particles. Star formation is included\nusing the multi-phase model of Springel & Hernquist\n(2003) with winds disabled. The simulation was started\nat z = 99, with initial conditions generated using the\ntransfer function of Eisenstein & Hu (1999) and cosmological parameters consistent with the combined analysis\nof three year WMAP and Ly\u03b1 forest data (Viel et al.\n2006; Seljak et al. 2006), (\u03a9m , \u03a9\u039b , \u03a9b h2 , h, \u03c38 , n)\n=\n(0.26, 0.74, 0.024, 0.72, 0.85, 0.95). The initial gas temperature was set to T = 272.8 K and the gravitational softening\nlength is 3h\u22121 comoving kpc. To check the numerical\nconvergence of our results we also run two further hydrodynamical simulations with lower mass resolution.

However, recent observations of molecular gas surrounding J1148 + 5251 indicate its\nhost halo mass may be closer to \u2243 1012 M\u2299 (Walter et al.\n2004). Theoretical arguments also suggest that the quasar\noccupation fraction of massive haloes may be significantly\nless than unity, perhaps favouring host haloes with lower average masses (Volonteri & Rees 2006). In any case, we have\nchecked that our results depend only weakly on the halo\nmass by running simulations centred on haloes of smaller\nmass.\nAt each redshift, five lines-of-sight where extracted\naround these haloes, giving 15 different lines-of-sight in total. To construct the density distributions for the radiative\ntransfer runs we splice together separate lines-of-sight drawn\nrandomly from the simulation volume. The first 30h\u22121 comoving Mpc of a spliced line-of-sight is constructed using\nthe density distribution drawn around one of the massive\nhaloes, in which we assume the quasar resides. The remaining 120h\u22121 comoving Mpc of the sight-line is made from two\nfurther sight-lines drawn randomly from the simulation box\nat the same redshift. This gives a total length of 150h\u22121\ncomoving Mpc, which is large enough to easily accommodate the observed sizes of Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 near-zones at z \u2243 6.\nEach line-of-sight consists of 3000 pixels with a size of 9.9\nkpc at z = 6. This provides a good degree of convergence\nfor our radiative transfer simulations (see appendix C for\ndetails). For reference, the redshift extent of each line-ofsight at z = [6.25, 6, 5.75] is \u2206z = [0.50, 0.47, 0.45]. Since the\ndensity distributions are drawn from a snapshot at a single\nredshift, the gas density is rescaled by a factor of (1 + z)3\nalong each spliced line-of-sight.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fNature and evolution of highly ionized near-zones\nTable 3.

In the latter case spatial\nfluctuations of the metagalactic ionizing background may\naffect the measured near-zone sizes.\n3.4\n\nConstructing synthetic absorption spectra\n\nWe construct synthetic spectra from the output of the radiative transfer simulations as follows. Each line-of-sight is\nrebinned to have N = 4096 pixels of proper width \u03b4R, each\nof which has a neutral hydrogen number density nHI , temperature T , peculiar velocity vpec and Hubble velocity vH\nassociated with it. The Ly\u03b1 optical depth in each pixel is\ncomputed assuming a Voigt line profile, such that the optical depth in pixel i corresponding to Hubble velocity vH (i)\nis\n\u03c4\u03b1 (i) =\n\nN\nc\u03c3\u03b1 \u03b4R X nHI (j)\nH(a, x).\nb(j)\n\u03c0 1/2\n\n(15)\n\nj=1\n\n3.3\n\nInitial conditions\n\nWe compute the transfer of radiation through an inhomogeneous hydrogen and helium IGM from a source which emits\n\u1e44 photons per second above the H I ionization threshold\nfrequency, where\n\u1e44 =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u03bdHI\n\nLHI\n\n\u0010 \u03bd \u0011\u2212\u03b1s\n\u03bdHI\n\nd\u03bd.\n\nThe source is assumed to have a power law spectrum with\nindex \u03b1s , typical of quasars, normalised by LHI at the\nH I ionization threshold frequency, \u03bdHI . We adopt \u03b1s = 1.5\nfor this study. The source is placed 10h\u22121 comoving kpc from\nthe edge of the line-of-sight; all hydrogen and helium within\nthis radius is assumed to be fully ionized. The distribution of\nnormalised densities \u2206 = \u03c1b /\u03c1\u0304b is kept constant during the\nradiative transfer simulations, while the gas density evolves\nas (1 + z)3 as the ionization front progresses along the lineof-sight. This should be a reasonable approximation over a\ntypical quasar lifetime.\nWe vary the lifetime of the source, tQ , the number of\nionizing photons emitted per second by the source, \u1e44 , and\nthe neutral hydrogen (and helium) fraction of the IGM. To\nset the neutral fractions in the IGM for each run, we assume\nthe gas is in ionization equilibrium with a spatially uniform\nUV background. The different UV background models we\nuse are listed in table 3, along with the resulting neutral\nhydrogen fraction at mean density at z = 6. Note, however,\nthat this does not necessarily correspond to the resulting\nvolume weighted neutral fraction in a simulated sight-line,\nas on average these will be moderately overdense and have\nvarying gas temperatures, although it gives a rough guide\nto the expected neutral hydrogen fraction for a given UV\nbackground. All UV background models assume a spectral\nindex of \u03b1b = 1.5, although the background spectrum may\nwell be softer if it is dominated by galaxies.

For Ly\u03b2 optical depths we adopt the same procedure,\nusing instead \u03c3\u03b2 = 7.18 \u00d7 10\u221219 cm2 , \u039b\u03b2 = 1.897 \u00d7 108 s\u22121\nand \u03bb\u03b2 = 1025.72 \u00c5. In addition, for the Ly\u03b2 spectra we\nalso add the optical depth contribution from the Ly\u03b1 forest at lower redshift, z \u2032 = [\u03bb\u03b2 (1 + z)/\u03bb\u03b1 ] \u2212 1, where z is\nthe redshift of the Ly\u03b2 pixels. The total Ly\u03b2 optical depth\nis then \u03c4\u03b2tot (z) = \u03c4\u03b2 (z) + \u03c4\u03b1 (z \u2032 ). In order to model the\nLy\u03b1 forest at z \u2032 , we use the standard technique of rescaling the optical depth distribution of synthetic spectra, also\ndrawn from our 4003 simulation at lower redshift, to reproduce the observed mean flux hF i of the Ly\u03b1 forest (see\nBolton et al. 2005 for details). The values for the mean flux\nwe adopt in this paper are interpolated from Songaila (2004):\nhF i = [0.149, 0.210, 0.223] at z \u2032 = [5.12, 4.91, 4.70], corresponding to z = [6.25, 6.0, 5.75].\nFor comparison to observational data, we must also\nmimic the typical resolution and noise of quasar spectra at\nz \u2243 6. The values for these vary in the literature from one\nline-of-sight to the next. We adopt a spectral resolution of\n4 \u00c5 per pixel by rebinning our simulated spectra and adding\nGaussian distributed noise with a total signal-to-noise ratio\nof 20 per pixel at the continuum level (e.g. Fan et al. 2000)\nand a constant read-out signal-to-noise of 80 per pixel.

The Ly\u03b2 spectrum has been rebinned to have the same bin\nsize as the Ly\u03b1 spectrum in velocity space. The solid line in each panel marks the extent of the quasar H II region, some way ahead of the\nedge of spectroscopically identified Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 near-zones.

We test this\nusing the hydrodynamical simulations listed in table 1. We\nfirstly select one of our spliced lines-of-sight at z = 6 from\nthe 4003 simulation, and construct lines-of-sight from the\nsame location in the lower resolution simulations. For all\nthree lines-of-sight we then use the radiative transfer code to\nmodel the propagation of ionizing radiation from a quasar\nwith \u1e44 = 5 \u00d7 1057 s\u22121 and tQ = 107 yrs into fully neutral hydrogen and helium gas. We subsequently extract the\nLy\u03b1 absorption spectra.\nThe results of this test are shown in figure 3. From left\nto right the panels show the density distribution, neutral\nhydrogen fraction and the resulting Ly\u03b1 near-zone profile\ndrawn from the radiative transfer runs in all three sightlines. The degree of convergence in the H II I-front position is good. The highest resolution simulation resolves a\ngreater number of overdense peaks, but the effect that this\nhas on the I-front position is counteracted by better resolved\nvoids. The main difference is that one sees more detailed\nstructure in the higher resolution simulation spectra. Note\nalso the smooth nature of the Ly\u03b1 near-zone profile due to\nthe damping wing from the neutral IGM; the edge of the\nLy\u03b1 near-zone lies behind the H II I-front as a result (e.g.\nMesinger & Haiman 2004). We conclude that the 4003 hydrodynamical simulation is sufficiently resolved for the purpose of this work with one caveat; the very dense regions\nresponsible for Lyman limit absorption systems will not be\nsufficiently resolved. We will come back to this in section 5.\n\n4\n\n4.1\n\nMULTI-FREQUENCY RADIATIVE\nTRANSFER THROUGH COSMOLOGICAL\nDENSITY FIELDS\nAn example line-of-sight\n\nIn figure 2 we had shown synthetic absorption spectra for\nan example line-of-sight at z = 6. Figure 4 shows a variety\nof physical properties along the same line-of-sight together\nwith a high resolution, high signal-to-noise version of the\nLy\u03b1 region of the absorption spectrum. The quasar is on the\nthe right hand side of the plot. The scale on the horizontal\naxis corresponds to the distance from the quasar in proper\nMpc. The top panel shows the normalised density \u2206 along\nthe line-of-sight. In the subsequent panels the output from\nthe radiative transfer code is shown. In descending order\nthe panels display the H I, He II and He III number densities\nnormalised by the total hydrogen number density, the gas\ntemperature, the peculiar velocity (drawn from the hydrodynamical simulation), the H I, He I and He II ionization rates\nand the energy input per ionization for H I, He I and He II.\nThe last panel shows the resulting Ly\u03b1 near-zone spectrum.\nThe ionizing source has an age tQ = 107 yrs, luminosity\n\u1e44 = 2 \u00d7 1057 s\u22121 and UV background model 4 has been\nadopted.\nThere are a few interesting points to note about figure 4 before proceeding. Firstly, the H II I-front has reached\n\u223c 11.8 Mpc, which is somewhat smaller than the value of\nRion = 16.6 Mpc one predicts with equation (3) assuming\n\u2206 = 1. This difference is largely due to the clumpy nature\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n9\n\nof the IGM and to a lesser extent the presence of helium.\nAdopting \u2206 = 2.2, the actual mean normalised density along\nthe line-of-sight, equation (3) predicts Rion = 11.8 Mpc,\nconsistent with the simulation results. It is the mean density of the gas which limits the propagation of the I-front in\nthis instance. In comparison, the He III I-front has reached\nthe significantly smaller distance of \u223c 4.1 Mpc from the\nsource. The large difference in the extent of the He III and\nH II I-fronts is due to the smaller fraction of H I compared\nto He II for the assumed metagalactic UV background.\nThe amount by which the quasar He III I-front lags\nbehind the H II I-front depends sensitively on the H I to\nHe II ratio in the surrounding IGM. Note that for a fully\nneutral IGM the extent of He III and H II I-fronts should be\nvery similar for typical quasar spectral index (Madau et al.\n1999). There is also evidence for a clear break in the mean\ntemperature of the IGM around 4 Mpc, corresponding to\nthe He III I-front position. The higher temperature is due\nto radiative transfer effects boosting the average energy\nper ionization when the He II is reionized by the quasar\n(Abel & Haehnelt 1999; Bolton et al. 2004). This effect becomes progressively larger for higher neutral helium fractions. Hence the widths of Ly\u03b1 absorption features observed in high resolution spectra of quasar near-zones (e.g.\nBecker et al. 2005) and their correlation (or lack of) with\ndistance from the quasar, combined with a lower limit to\nthe extent of the H II I-front, contain interesting information on the ionization state of hydrogen and helium in the\nIGM as well as the spectral index of the source. However,\nthis may be complicated by the presence of high temperature\nshocked gas near the quasar host halo. Detailed modelling\nwill be needed before any firm conclusions can be drawn\nfrom observational data.\nThe second and third last panels in figure 4 show the\nbehaviour of the combined quasar and metagalactic background radiation fields at three frequencies, corresponding\nto the ionization thresholds of H I, He I and He II. The\nquasar radiation field falls in intensity due to increasing\ndistance from the quasar and the decreasing photon mean\nfree path, until the ionization rate per atom/ion drops to\nthe uniform value adopted for the UV background model.\nThe filtering effect of radiative transfer on the spectrum of\nthe quasar radiation field is clearly visible in the second\nlast panel. Higher energy photons have a longer mean free\npath, boosting the average energy per ionization in places\nwhere the gas is optically thick and the spectrum has consequently hardened. Note that the energy per ionization\nfor H I actually decreases somewhat between the H II and\nHe III I-fronts because the photo-heating rate for H I falls\nin this region as high energy photons are soaked up by the\noptically thick helium.\nFinally, the bottom panel in figure 4 shows the resulting\nLy\u03b1 spectrum for a pixel size of \u223c 0.25 \u00c5. A signal-to-noise\nper pixel of 20 at the continuum level has been adopted,\nwith a constant read-out signal-to-noise of 100 per pixel.\nSpectra of similar quality are already obtainable with current instruments (Becker et al. 2005, 2006b). However, for\nthe synthetic spectra used in this paper we adopt the moderate spectral resolution shown in figure 2, which is more\ntypical of most of the observational data. The solid vertical\nlines in both panels in figure 2 mark the extent of the quasar\nH II region at 11.8 Mpc. Clearly the extent of the Ly\u03b1 near-\n\n\f10\n\nJ.S. Bolton & M.G.

In the left panel the IGM neutral hydrogen fraction is varied for a fixed quasar age and luminosity, in the\ncentral panel the quasar luminosity is varied for fixed quasar age and IGM neutral hydrogen fraction, and in the right panel the quasar\nage is varied for fixed quasar luminosity and IGM neutral hydrogen fraction. The values of the fixed quantities are listed in the bottom\nright of each panel.

(2005) respectively.\n\nzone, R\u03b1 \u2243 8.3 Mpc, is some way behind the H II I-front.\nNote also that the extent of the Ly\u03b2 and Ly\u03b1 near-zones\nare the same even though the volume weighted neutral fraction of the IGM in this line-of-sight is \u223c 10\u22122 prior to the\nquasar switching on. In this instance, naively using equation (12), one might expect the Ly\u03b2 near-zone to be somewhat larger than the Ly\u03b1 near-zone. The reason for the similarity in their size is clear on examining the density distribution along this particular sight line, shown in the top panel\nin figure 4. The transmission peaks in the Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 spectra at \u223c 8.3 Mpc correspond to the very low density void at\nthe same position in the density distribution. Beyond this\nthere are several high density clumps which attenuate the\nquasar radiation field and prevent any further transmission\nin either spectra. Consequently, variations in the density distribution of the IGM, as well as the potential insensitivity\nof the Ly\u03b1 near-zone size to the neutral hydrogen fraction,\nwill make attempts to determine fHI using near-zone sizes\ndifficult. Combining the Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 near-zone sizes obviously helps, but this will not necessarily give the correct\nextent of the quasar H II region for any individual spectrum\neither. As we will discuss in more detail later, reasonably\nlarge samples of high quality data will be required to better determine the ionization state of the surrounding IGM\nusing near-zone sizes. We further note that the presence of\nthe lower redshift Ly\u03b1 forest in the Ly\u03b2 spectrum clearly\nreduces the amplitude of the Ly\u03b2 transition and in some\ncases will block transmission peaks from the Ly\u03b2 near-zone.\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n4.2\n\nThe measured sizes of Ly\u03b1 near-zones in\ncosmological density fields\n\nIn figure 5 we explore the dependence of Ly\u03b1 near-zone sizes\non the ionization state of the surrounding IGM and the luminosity and lifetime of quasars using realistic density distributions drawn from our cosmological hydrodynamical simulation.

For each neutral hydrogen fraction we have performed a full radiative transfer calculation for the five different lines-of-sight drawn from our simulation box at z = 6.\nThe near-zone sizes were measured out to our fiducial flux\nlimit of Flim = e\u22122.3 = 0.1, and are shown by the open diamonds in figure 5. Note that some of these data points fall\non top of each other, giving the appearance of less than five\ndata points for some of the parameters. The resolution of\neach synthetic spectrum was degraded and noise was added\nto mimic the observational data. The larger filled diamonds\nshow the average value of R\u03b1 for each parameter set. The\nneutral hydrogen fraction of the surrounding IGM was varied using UV background models 0 \u2212 10, described in table 3. The lifetime and luminosity of the quasar were fixed\nat tQ = 107 yrs and \u1e44 = 2\u00d71057 s\u22121 , respectively. The solid\nmax\ncurve shows R\u03b1\nassuming \u2206lim = 0.4. The dashed curve\nshows Rion assuming \u2206 = 1 and the horizontal dotted line\ncorresponds to the length of each simulated line-of-sight.\nThe first point to note about figure 5 is the considerable\nspread in the inferred near-zone sizes from one line-of-sight\nto the next when all other parameters are fixed. This high-\n\n\f12\n\nJ.S. Bolton & M.G. Haehnelt\n\nlights the importance of taking into account the effect of a\nrealistic density field containing voids and overdense clumps\non the observed size and appearance of the near-zone. In\nparticular, as in figure 2, it is the most underdense voids\nwithin the quasar H II region which set the observed extent\nof the spectroscopically identified Ly\u03b1 near-zone.\nWe can now investigate how the actual near-zone sizes\nmax\nrelate to our analytical estimates for Rion and R\u03b1\ngiven\nin section 2. Firstly, we consider the effect of varying the\nsurrounding IGM neutral hydrogen fraction, as shown in the\nleft hand panel of figure 5. For large values of the neutral\nhydrogen fraction the observed Ly\u03b1 near-zone size can be\napproximated by Rion , albeit with an offset from our chosen\nvalue of \u2206 = 1 due to gas clumping. The near-zone size\n\u22121/3\nincreases with decreasing neutral fraction as fHI , but note\nalso the slight deviation of the data point for an entirely\nneutral IGM from the expected scaling due to the presence of\nan extended damping wing from the Gunn-Peterson trough.\nmax\nAs expected the observed sizes saturate at R\u03b1\nwhere they\ndo not increase further with decreasing neutral fraction until\nfHI \u2264 10\u22123.5 . However, even for fHI > 0.1 it is difficult\nto determine the neutral fraction accurately from a small\nsample of absorption spectra due to the rather large scatter\nmax\nin near-zone sizes. Evaluating equation (13) using R\u03b1\n=\n7.85, corresponding to \u2206lim = 0.4 in equation (11), and\nfHI \u2265 0.1 results in a timescale for the H II I-front to reach\nR\u03b1 greater than or similar to the assumed quasar age of\ntQ = 107 yrs if \u2206 \u2265 1. For the chosen values of the quasar\nionizing luminosity and lifetime, saturation thus occurs at\nfHI < 0.1. For larger quasar ionizing luminosity or longer\nlifetime the saturation would occur at larger neutral fraction\nand vice versa.\nFor neutral hydrogen fractions smaller than 10\u22123.5 , the\nLy\u03b1 near-zone sizes measured using our definition (see section 2.2) increase rapidly as transmission from the IGM ionized by the metagalactic UV background rather than the\nquasar becomes more common. Strictly speaking, these sizes\nno longer correspond to the regions impacted by the quasar\nionizing radiation. With further decreasing neutral fraction\nthe near zone sizes rapidly approach the box-size of the numerical simulation shown by the dotted line. This is one of\nthe reasons why Fan et al. (2006b) take the necessary step\nof smoothing their Ly\u03b1 spectra to obtain the Ly\u03b1 near-zone\nsizes; not doing so makes distinguishing between the many\nthin transmission peaks from the highly ionized, underdense\nIGM and the true edge of the near-zone very difficult. However, smoothing will have the effect of attributing transmission peaks from the IGM to the size of the quasar near-zone,\ninfluencing the perceived evolution in smoothed near-zone\nsizes in the regime where the IGM makes the transition from\nbeing optically thick to optically thin. One must be aware of\nthis effect when interpreting data which has been smoothed.\nWe discuss this in further detail in section 5.\nIn the middle and right panels of figure 5 we show the\ndependence of the Ly\u03b1 near-zone size on quasar ionizing\nluminosity and quasar lifetime for an IGM neutral hydrogen\nfraction fHI \u2243 10\u22123 (UV background model 6). The dashed\nmax\nand solid curves again show Rion and R\u03b1\n, respectively.\nThe simulated near-zone sizes scale with ionizing luminosity\nas R\u03b1 \u221d \u1e44 1/2 and are independent of the lifetime of the\nquasar as expected for this neutral hydrogen fraction, where\nmax\nR\u03b1 = R\u03b1\n. Note that for a significantly neutral IGM with\n\nfHI \u2265 0.1, one would see an evolution in the near-zone size\n1/3\nroughly proportional to tQ until tQ \u2265 107 yrs. Overall, the\nmax\nanalytic approximations Rion and R\u03b1\nappear to provide\na reasonable guide for understanding the nature of quasar\nnear-zones for 10\u22123 \u2264 fHI \u2264 1.\nThe filled grey circles and open circles in the middle\npanel show the observed sizes of Ly\u03b1 near-zones as determined by Fan et al. (2006b) and Wyithe et al. (2005) respectively. There is good agreement between the smaller\nnear-zone sizes and the model, suggesting consistency with\nfHI \u223c 10\u22123 in these cases. The larger near-zone sizes, predominantly at z < 6, lie somewhat above the values from\nthe simulated spectra, but the uncertainties in the source\nluminosity, the measured near-zone size and the near-zone\nsize distribution due to cosmic variance should be kept in\nmind. We will come back to this point later. Note also again\nthat the simulated spectra discussed here have not been\nsmoothed. As we will see in section 5, if we smooth the\nspectra this discrepancy becomes larger.\n4.3\n\nComparing Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 near-zone sizes\n\nIn the last section we demonstrated that R\u03b1 alone is not\nvery sensitive to the ionization state of the surrounding\nIGM for typical quasar ionizing luminosities and lifetimes.\nThis is due to the saturation of the near-zone size for a low\nmax\nneutral hydrogen fractions at R\u03b1\nand the large scatter\nin near-zone sizes due to density fluctuations. The relative\nsize of R\u03b1 and R\u03b2 is an independent probe of the ionizamax\ntion state which stays useful when R\u03b1 is saturated at R\u03b1\n.\nIn figure 6 we compare the Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 near-zone sizes\npredicted by 20 of the radiative transfer simulations with\nprogressively smaller IGM neutral hydrogen fractions. The\nsolid line shows R\u03b2 = 2.5R\u03b1 , which is the approximate upper limit to the expected size of the Ly\u03b2 near-zone predicted by equation (12). The dotted line shows R\u03b1 = R\u03b2 ,\nthe expected relation when the IGM is substantially neutral.\nAs noted earlier, these theoretical limits ignore the effect of\nforeground absorption from the lower redshift Ly\u03b1 forest on\nobserved Ly\u03b2 near-zone sizes. However, we do include this\neffect in the synthetic spectra analysed here.\nFor fHI \u2265 10\u22122 the simulated spectra appear to follow the R\u03b2 = R\u03b1 relation. For small neutral hydrogen fractions (fHI \u223c 10\u22123 ) the data exhibit an upward deviation\napproaching but not reaching the R\u03b2 = 2.5R\u03b1 relation. This\nsuggests that the inhomogeneous IGM, and to a lesser extent the additional absorption from the Ly\u03b1 forest in the\nLy\u03b2 spectrum, combined with limited spectral resolution,\nreduces the Ly\u03b2 near-zone sizes more strongly than the\nLy\u03b1 near-zone sizes. Hence, for fHI \u223c 10\u22122 (UV background\nmodel 4) the Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 near-zone sizes can still be rather\nsimilar.\nNote that for some of the completely neutral IGM models (UV background model 0), R\u03b2 is slightly larger than\nR\u03b1 due to the Ly\u03b1 Gunn-Peterson trough damping wing\n(e.g. Mesinger & Haiman 2004). In the absence of this effect one would expect R\u03b1 \u2243 R\u03b2 , since R\u03b1 has still not\nreached its maximum and thus both near-zones trace the extent of the H II I-front. Note further that the time scale for\nthe H II I-front to reach R\u03b2 is around 16 times longer than\nthe timescale to reach R\u03b1 . Consequently, the Ly\u03b2 near-zone\nkeeps increasing in size for some time after the Ly\u03b1 nearc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fNature and evolution of highly ionized near-zones\n\nFigure 6.

An ionizing photon production rate of\n\u1e44 = 2 \u00d7 1057 s\u22121 and age of tQ = 107 yrs has been assumed for\nthe quasar. The solid line shows R\u03b2 = 2.5R\u03b1 , which is the approximate upper limit to the size of the Ly\u03b2 near-zone predicted\nby equation (12), while the dotted line shows R\u03b1 = R\u03b2 .

This can be seen by comparing\nthe results for UV background models 4 and 6.\nThe filled circle with error bars show the observationally determined size of the Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 near-zones around\nJ1030 + 0524 taken from White et al. (2003). We have assumed an uncertainty in the quasar redshift of \u2206z = 0.03.\nIts location close to the R\u03b1 = R\u03b2 line appears to suggest\nthat fHI \u2265 10\u22122 . However, the large scatter in near-zone\nsize makes it very difficult to come to definite conclusions\nfor individual systems.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nTHE OBSERVED REDSHIFT EVOLUTION\nOF NEAR-ZONE SIZES\nThe simulations\n\nIn a recent paper Fan et al. (2006b) (hereinafter F06b)\npresent evidence for evolution in the size of Ly\u03b1 near-zone\nsizes with redshift. The conclusion of F06b using a sample of 16 quasars, was that the average Ly\u03b1 near-zone size\nincreases by a factor of 2.8 from z = 6.4 to z = 5.7 after correcting for quasar luminosity differences. Assuming\n\u22121/3\nthat R\u03b1 \u221d (1 + z)\u22121 fHI , F06b note this corresponds to\nfHI decreasing by a factor of \u223c 14. Assuming a value of\nfHI \u223c 9.3 \u00d7 10\u22125 at z = 5.7 based on their direct optical\ndepth measurements suggests fHI \u223c 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22123 at z = 6.4.\nHowever, as we have shown already, the dependence of the\nLy\u03b1 near-zone size on fHI is not so straightforward. We shall\nattempt to model this evolution here using three different\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n13\n\nscenarios for the IGM neutral hydrogen fraction evolution\nwithin our radiative transfer implementation.\nIn all three scenarios, we shall consider a quasar embedded in an inhomogeneous hydrogen and helium IGM. We set\nthe quasar to have the fiducial values \u1e44 = 2 \u00d7 1057 s\u22121 and\ntQ = 107 yrs. As before, the IGM density distributions used\nfor the radiative transfer runs are drawn in different directions around the 5 most massive haloes in the simulation\nvolume at z = [6.25, 6, 5.75], giving a total of 15 different\nlines-of-sight for comparison to the F06b data. In the first\nscenario we simulate the propagation of radiation from the\nsource into the IGM at z = [6.25, 6, 5.75] using UV background models 6, 9 and 10 respectively. These UV background models reproduce volume weighted neutral hydrogen\nfractions which are consistent with estimates from the direct\nGunn-Peterson optical depth measurements of F06b. This\nscenario corresponds to a moderate evolution of the IGM\nneutral fraction with redshift. In the second scenario we use\nUV background models 1, 6 and 10 at z = [6.25, 6, 5.75],\nrespectively. This scenario corresponds to a rapid evolution\nin the IGM neutral hydrogen fraction above z = 6, where\nUV background model 1 corresponds to a substantially neutral IGM at z = 6.25, consistent with the lower limits on\nfHI from both Mesinger & Haiman (2004) and Wyithe et al.\n(2005). In the third scenario, we also adopt a moderate evolution in the neutral hydrogen fraction, but in addition take\ninto account the effect of self-shielded dense clumps. These\nsystems are expected to be responsible for Lyman limit systems, but our hydrodynamical simulations do not fully resolve them. To include them we use a simple model for selfshielded clumps based on the model of reionization in the\npost-overlap phase by Miralda-Escud\u00e9 et al. (2000). The details of this model are described in appendix D.\n\n5.2\n\nThe relative sizes of Ly\u03b1 near-zones and their\nevolution with redshift\n\nAs discussed in previous sections and by F06b, determining the absolute sizes of the near-zones is plagued with a\nrange of uncertainties. One should, however, hope that these\nuncertainties depend weakly on redshift. Therefore, in this\nsection we will firstly investigate the redshift evolution in\nthe relative sizes of Ly\u03b1 near-zones found by F06b. We undertake a comparison of the absolute near-zone sizes with\nthe observations of F06b in the next section. The evolution\nof the synthetic Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 near-zone sizes with redshift\nfor our three scenarios is shown in figure 7, similar to figure\n13 in F06b. We note however that figure 13 in F06b is not\ncorrected for the quasar luminosity, whereas for the simulations used in figure 7 we have assumed a constant value of\n\u1e44 = 2 \u00d7 1057 s\u22121 . In addition, the spectra in each bin in\nfigure 13 of F06b are from a range of redshifts, rather than\nall at the same redshift.\nFollowing F06b, the simulated spectra are smoothed to\na resolution of 20 \u00c5 and the composite absorption profile of\nthe 5 lines-of-sight at each redshift is plotted. To compare\nthese data to the observational results of F06b, we adopt\ntheir definition of the Ly\u03b1 near-zone. This is defined as the\nextent of the smoothed spectrum where the normalised flux\nis greater than 0.1. This hopefully provides a more robust\nway of defining R\u03b1 when we are considering examples where\n\n\f14\n\nJ.S. Bolton & M.G. Haehnelt\n\nFigure 7. The evolution of Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 near-zone size with redshift for different IGM neutral hydrogen fractions. Each panel shows\nthe composite absorption profile constructed from 5 lines-of-sight in redshift bins at z = [6.25, 6, 5.75]. The spectra have been degraded\nto resemble observational spectra and then smoothed to a resolution of 20 \u00c5. The Ly\u03b1 profiles are shown on the left hand side, with the\nLy\u03b2 profiles on the right. In all cases the quasar has an age of tQ = 107 yrs and an ionizing photon production rate of \u1e44 = 2 \u00d7 1057 s\u22121 .\nTop: Near-zone sizes for an IGM ionized by a uniform metagalactic UV background, corresponding to the moderate evolution scenario.\nCentre: The UV background models are now chosen to produce a rapid evolution in the neutral hydrogen fraction. Bottom: Near-zone sizes\nfor an IGM which is highly ionized at low densities by a uniform UV background but is completely neutral above a fixed density threshold.\nThis mimics the behaviour of dense self-shielded clumps responsible for Lyman limit systems.\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fNature and evolution of highly ionized near-zones\ntransmission from the thinning Ly\u03b1 forest affect the extent\nof the near-zones.\nThe data in the top panels in figure 7 correspond to\nthe moderate evolution scenario. Between z = 5.75 and\nz = 6.25, the Ly\u03b1 near-zone size decreases by a factor of\n2.1. This is slightly less than the amount of evolution seen\nby F06b from z = 5.7 to z = 6.4, but is consistent with\nthe their data over the smaller redshift range we consider.\n\u22121/3\nUsing the theoretical scaling R\u03b1 \u221d (1 + z)\u22121 fHI , this\nwould imply that the IGM neutral hydrogen fraction has\nchanged by a factor \u223c 7 over the range 5.75 \u2264 z \u2264 6.25.\nHowever, the average volume weighted IGM neutral hydrogen fraction used in each redshift bin in the top panels is\nfHI = [1.6\u00d710\u22123 , 1.5\u00d710\u22124 , 8.1\u00d710\u22125 ] at z = [6.25, 6, 5.75].\nThus, the IGM neutral fraction we use actually changes by\na factor of \u223c 20 over this range. Note that there is little evolution in the composite Ly\u03b1 near-zone sizes between\nz = 6.25 and z = 6 because the sizes of the near-zones\nare just leaving the saturated regime. A substantial part of\nthe evolution of the near-zone size therefore occurred for the\nrather small change in neutral fraction between z = 5.75 and\nz = 6, where the IGM neutral hydrogen fraction changes\nby less than a factor of two. In this redshift range the\nLy\u03b1 near-zones sizes are no longer near the saturated regime,\nwhich occurs approximately for 10\u22123 \u2264 fHI \u2264 10\u22121 . In this\ninstance, transmission from the IGM ionized by the UV\nbackground contributes to the Ly\u03b1 near-zone size in the\nsmoothed spectra; the flux from the quasar at the edge of\nthe near-zone is comparable to the flux of the metagalactic\nUV background ionizing the surrounding IGM. Therefore,\nrelatively small changes in the highly ionized IGM neutral\nhydrogen fraction can produce a rapid evolution in the observed sizes of Ly\u03b1 near-zones using the F06b definition of\nnear-zone sizes. This occurs at a neutral hydrogen fraction of\nfHI \u223c 10\u22124 . Rapid evolution in the smoothed Ly\u03b1 near-zone\nsizes over the redshift range 5.75 \u2264 z \u2264 6.25 is therefore not\nnecessarily strong evidence for a significantly neutral IGM\njust above z = 6. We briefly note that we have tested this\nfurther by varying the flux limit used to define the smoothed\nnear-zone sizes. For Flim > 0.1, the redshift evolution in the\nsmoothed near-zone sizes is somewhat weaker. It should be\nan interesting test to perform the same exercise on the observed data.\nIn the top right panel we show the corresponding composite absorption profiles for the Ly\u03b2 near-zones. The level\nof transmission in the Ly\u03b2 near-zone is 2 \u2212 3 times lower\ncompared to the Ly\u03b1 near-zone. This is mainly due to foreground Ly\u03b1 absorption from gas at lower redshift. The F06b\ndefinition for R\u03b1 is therefore not appropriate as a definition\nfor R\u03b2 . The transmission profile of the Ly\u03b2 near-zone is\nmuch shallower, more extended and fluctuates strongly. The\nLy\u03b2 near-zones all extend beyond the extent of the corresponding Ly\u03b1 near-zones, albeit by only around one Mpc\nat z = 6.25. This is expected since the optical depth for\nLy\u03b2 absorption is smaller and larger neutral hydrogen fractions can be probed.\nIn the central panels we show the results for the rapid\nevolution scenario, with fHI = [3.1 \u00d7 10\u22121 , 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 , 8.1 \u00d7\n10\u22125 ] at z = [6.25, 6, 5.75]. In this case, the composite\nLy\u03b1 near-zone size decreases by factor of 3.1 from z = 5.75\nto 6.25. This is somewhat larger than the F06b observed evo\u22121/3\nlution. Again the scaling R\u03b1 \u221d (1 + z)\u22121 fHI would imply\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n15\n\nthat fHI has changed by a factor of 24, compared to an actual change by a factor of over 3800. However, most of the\nnear-zone size evolution in the centre-left panel has again\noccurred for the rather small change in neutral fraction between z = 5.75 and z = 6. In the centre-right panel, at z = 6\nthe Ly\u03b2 transmission extends beyond the Ly\u03b1 transmission\nas before. In the z = 6.25 case the Ly\u03b2 transmission extends\nthe same distance as the Ly\u03b1 transmission, since in this case\nthe edge of the near-zones correspond to the quasar H II Ifront. As discussed earlier, the Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 near-zones are\nexpected to have a similar size for an IGM with fHI \u2265 10\u22122\nwithin our models. A comparison of the Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 nearzones sizes for a large sample of high quality quasar spectra\nshould thus tell whether the IGM is significantly neutral just\nabove z = 6 or not.\nFinally, in the bottom panels we show the mean absorption profiles for models which also take into account\nthe effect of self-shielded clumps (SSCs), as described in\nappendix D. These models should be a more realistic\nrepresentation of the post-overlap phase of reionization\n(Miralda-Escud\u00e9 et al. 2000; Gnedin 2000). The average volume weighted neutral hydrogen fraction in each redshift bin\nfor these models is fHI = [7.4\u00d710\u22122 , 1.1\u00d710\u22122 , 4.3\u00d710\u22123 ] at\nz = [6.25, 6, 5.75]. Note, however, that the volume weighted\nneutral fractions are considerably lower if the SSCs are excluded, i.e. for the IGM with \u2206 < \u2206SSC . Excluding regions with \u2206 \u2265 \u2206SSC the neutral hydrogen fractions in the\nhighly ionized IGM are fHI (\u2206 < \u2206SSC ) = [7.9 \u00d7 10\u22124 , 7.3 \u00d7\n10\u22125 , 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 ]. These values are similar to those used for\nthe moderate evolution scenario in the top panels. Compared to the models with no SSCs in the top panels, there\nis little difference in the Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 near-zones shown in\nthe bottom panels. Note that although the volume weighted\nneutral hydrogen fraction is high in these sight-lines, especially at z = 6.25, the low density regions which dominate\nthe transmission features are still highly ionized. Therefore,\nthe inclusion of SSCs appears to have little effect on the\npropagation of the quasar I-front. This is perhaps not too\nsurprising as the SSCs would have to contain a significant\nfraction of the total hydrogen mass in neutral form in order induce a significant evolution in the near-zone sizes with\nredshift. For a highly ionized IGM the SSCs are therefore\nnot important. This may, however, be different for smaller\nneutral fractions and/or at higher redshift.\nIn summary, the relative sizes of Ly\u03b1 near-zones and\ntheir evolution with redshift are consistent with a moderate change in the IGM neutral fraction. Using an analysis\nsimilar to that performed on observed near-zone spectra, we\nfind even small changes in the neutral fraction of a highly\nionized IGM can produce a rapid evolution in the sizes of\nLy\u03b1 near-zones if the flux from the quasar at the edge of\nthe near-zone is similar to the flux of the metagalactic UV\nbackground at the Lyman limit. However, because of the\ninsensitivity of near-zones to the neutral fraction and the\nscatter in near-zone sizes due to fluctuations in the IGM\ndensity field, a substantially neutral IGM at z > 6 is also\nconsistent with the data. A detailed analysis of the corresponding sizes of Ly\u03b2 near-zones should help to distinguish\nbetween these possibilities.\n\n\f16\n\nJ.S. Bolton & M.G. Haehnelt\n\nFigure 8. The sizes of Ly\u03b1 near-zones as a function of redshift.\nThe filled black circles correspond to the individual Ly\u03b1 near-zone\nsizes taken from the synthetic spectra in the moderate evolution\nscenario. Here the quasar is assumed to have an ionizing luminosity of \u1e44 = 2 \u00d7 1057 s\u22121 . The observed correlation between\nLy\u03b1 near-zone size and redshift, determined empirically by Fan\net al. (2006b), is shown with the dashed line.

The simulation data lie slightly below this fit,\nalthough the evolutionary trend is roughly similar. The filled grey\ncircles correspond to the same synthetic sight-lines, except now\nthe quasar ionizing luminosity is increased to \u1e44 = 5 \u00d7 1057 s\u22121 .\nThese data are in somewhat better agreement with the fit to the\nobservational data. Note that the solid vertical lines are to guide\nthe eye only. In addition, only four data points are visible for\nthe \u1e44 = 2 \u00d7 1057 s\u22121 data at z = 6.25 and z = 5.75. In these\ninstances two near-zones have been measured to have the same\nsize.\n\n5.3\n\nThe absolute sizes of Ly\u03b1 near-zones and\ntheir evolution with redshift\n\nWe now compare the absolute sizes of the synthetic\nLy\u03b1 near-zones with the observations of F06b. In figure 8\nwe plot the individual Ly\u03b1 near-zone sizes used in the moderate evolution scenario against redshift as filled black circles, similar to figure 12 in F06b. The dashed line is the\nempirically determined correlation between R\u03b1 and redshift\nquoted by F06b. The dotted line is the same relation assuming the observed near-zone redshifts were overestimated by\n\u2206z = 0.02, which is the uncertainty quoted by F06b. The\nobserved Ly\u03b1 near-zone sizes from which this fit is derived in\nF06b, shown by the open diamonds in figure 8, are rescaled\nto a common absolute magnitude of M1450 = \u221227, assuming\n\u1e44 \u221d M1450 and R\u03b1 \u221d \u1e44 1/3 . This is an uncertain correction\nand a rescaling by \u1e44 1/2 may actually be more appropriate. Using the spectral energy distribution given by equation (14), M1450 = \u221227 corresponds to \u1e44 = 1.9 \u00d7 1057 s\u22121 ,\nwhich is close to the fiducial value of \u1e44 = 2 \u00d7 1057 s\u22121\nadopted for this study. We also note briefly the linear fit to\nthe observational data shown in figure 12 of F06b is given by\n\nR\u03b1 = 8 \u2212 9(z \u2212 6) Mpc, which is reproduced in our figure 8.\nThis is slightly different to equation (24) in F06b, which\nthey quoted erroneously (X. Fan, private communication).\nInterestingly, we obtain Ly\u03b1 near-zone sizes which are\n20-50 per cent smaller than the observational data. The relative evolution and scatter in the near-zone sizes is broadly\nconsistent with the F06b results. This may indicate that\nthe actual density and temperature distribution of the IGM\nis somewhat different from that in our numerical simulations and that the actual mean neutral fraction is somewhat\nsmaller than we have assumed for the simulated spectra.\nAnother obvious way of reconciling the synthetic near-zone\nsizes of our moderate evolution scenario with the observational data is to increase the ionizing flux in the the nearzone. The filled grey circles in figure 8 correspond to the\nsame synthetic sight-lines, except now the quasar ionizing\nluminosity is set to \u1e44 = 5 \u00d7 1057 s\u22121 , a factor of 2.5 larger\nthan before. The near-zone sizes are now in better agreement\nwith the observational data. However, it appears unlikely\nthat the observed quasar luminosities are underestimated\nby a factor of two to three. If an enhanced ionizing luminosity really were required to reproduce the absolute sizes of\nobserved Ly\u03b1 near-zones, this may instead be attributed to\nstar forming galaxies which are likely to cluster in the dense\nenvironment surrounding the quasar.\nRecently, Yu & Lu (2005) suggested that the majority\nof the neutral hydrogen surrounding a quasar may have\nalready been ionized by stellar sources before the quasar\nswitches on. However, a factor three larger ionizing luminosity appears again too large, considering quasars are already\nextremely luminous objects. There is, however, an important effect which our simulations do not take into account\nwhich can increase the combined ionizing flux from galaxies\n(and faint quasars) in the near-zone without an enhanced\nionizing luminosity from individual galaxies. The enhanced\nionizing flux from the quasar in the near-zone will ionize\ndense neutral regions which otherwise block the ionizing radiation from other sources of ionizing photons. This leads\nto a significant increase of the ionizing photon mean free\npath within the near-zone compared to the mean free path\nin the surrounding IGM. This will lead to an increase in the\nmetagalactic UV background flux due to the galaxies and\npossibly other, fainter quasars within the near-zone. An accurate estimate of this effect is difficult but a rough estimate\ncan be obtained using our SSC model (Miralda-Escud\u00e9 et al.\n2000; Furlanetto & Oh 2005, and also see appendix D). An\nincrease by a factor of two or three in the ionizing flux at\nthe edge of the near-zone appears plausible.\nThere is a range of other effects which may affect the\nestimated near-zone sizes. However, they should be less important than the effects discussed above. Spatial fluctuations in the UV background expected around the end of\nreionization may influence the size of observed near-zones.\nIn addition, gas in highly overdense regions is likely to be\nshocked, producing hot, highly ionized gas. This has not\nbeen taken account in our simulations. However, the volume filling factor of this hot, ionized gas phase is expected\nto be small at z = 6. The difficulty of the data reduction\nmay also contribute to the discrepancy. The continuum fitting of these highly absorbed spectra in the region of the\nbroad Ly\u03b1 emission line is notoriously difficult. Unidentified emission lines could easily lead to a quasar continuum\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fNature and evolution of highly ionized near-zones\nwhich is placed too low at the relevant distance from the systemic redshift. This would result in an overestimate of the\ntransmission and could therefore result in an overestimate\nof the observed near-zone sizes.\n\n6\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION\n\nWe have presented a detailed investigation of the properties\nof near-zones in the Lyman series absorption spectra of\nz \u2243 6 quasars, using analytical estimates and an accurate\nradiative transfer scheme for a hydrogen and helium IGM\ncombined with density distributions drawn from a large\nhydrodynamical simulation of a \u039bCDM universe. From the\nradiative transfer simulations we have produced realistic\nmock spectra which we have analysed in a similar manner\nto the current observational data. The main conclusions of\nthis study are as follows.\n\u2022 For large IGM neutral hydrogen fractions the size of\n\u22121/3\nthe near-zone increases as fHI , as expected for an\nH II I-front expanding into a significantly neutral medium.\nFor typical luminosities of observed z \u2243 6 quasars and\nplausible lifetimes, the near-zone sizes saturate at a neutral\nfraction fHI \u2248 0.1. For smaller neutral fractions the spectroscopically identified near-zones are more akin to classical\nproximity zones within a highly ionized IGM, and their size\nis largely independent of the neutral hydrogen fraction of\nthe surrounding IGM.\n\u2022 The density fluctuations in a cosmologically representative\nmatter distribution lead to considerable scatter in the size\nof the near-zones, even for fixed assumptions about the\nionization state of the surrounding IGM. It is thus difficult\nto determine the IGM neutral hydrogen fraction from a\nsmall number of observed spectra.\n\u2022 Observed sizes of spectroscopically identified near-zones\nin the Ly\u03b1 region alone are a rather poor indicator of\nthe ionization state of the surrounding IGM. Observed\nnear-zone sizes can furthermore substantially underestimate\nthe size of the region impacted by the ionizing radiation of\nthe quasar.\n\u2022 For small neutral hydrogen fractions quasar He III I-fronts\nlag considerably behind their H II counterparts if He II is\nstill abundant. This leads to a temperature jump behind\nthe He III I-front which can be located within the observed\nnear-zone for a suitable combination of IGM neutral fraction, quasar luminosity and quasar lifetime. Detailed study\nof the width of the absorption features in the Ly\u03b1 near-zone\nmay therefore reveal the position of the He III front. This\ncould then be used together with the Ly\u03b1 near-zone size to\nconstrain the neutral hydrogen fraction.\n\u2022 The ratio of near-zone sizes in the Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 region\nof quasar spectra provides another independent probe of\nthe ionization state of the surrounding IGM. For neutral\nfractions fHI \u2265 10\u22122 we find that the size of the Ly\u03b1 and\nLy\u03b2 near-zones are similar. For smaller neutral fractions\nthe size of the Ly\u03b2 region becomes substantially larger,\napproaching the theoretical limit of R\u03b2 \u2243 2.5R\u03b1 . The\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n17\n\nextent of the Ly\u03b2 near-zone relative to Ly\u03b1 is blurred by\nthe overlying Ly\u03b1 forest at lower redshift. It is also very\nsensitive to the density distribution along the line-of-sight.\nFor this reason the ratio of the sizes of the Ly\u03b1 and\nLy\u03b2 near-zones approaches the saturated value at a neu\u22122\ntral fraction somewhat smaller (fHI <\n\u223c 10 ) than where\nsaturation sets in for the sizes of Ly\u03b1 near-zones alone\n(fHI \u223c 10\u22121 ). The exact value of the threshold neutral\nhydrogen fractions depends on the quasar luminosity and\nlifetime.\n\u2022 The synthetic spectra produced from our radiative\ntransfer simulations exhibit Ly\u03b1 near-zones which are\n20 \u2212 50 per cent smaller than the observed spectra for\nplausible assumptions for the ionizing luminosity of the the\nquasar and the flux of the metagalactic UV background in\nthe surrounding IGM. The discrepancy is resolved if the\nionizing flux at the edge of the near-zone is enhanced by a\nfactor of two to three. Such an enhancement is plausible\ngiven the expected increase in the ionizing photon mean free\npath in the near-zone compared to the mean free path in\nthe surrounding IGM. This would produce a corresponding\nenhancement of the metagalactic UV background within\nthe near-zone from stellar emission and possibly fainter\nquasars. Alternatively, it may suggest that the IGM has\na lower neutral fraction than we assumed in our simulations.\n\u2022 The strong evolution of the observed sizes of Ly\u03b1 nearzones over the short redshift interval 5.7 < z < 6.4 is\nconsistent with, but does not require, a rapid evolution of\nthe neutral hydrogen fraction of the surrounding IGM. The\nobserved evolution in the Ly\u03b1 near-zone size by around\na factor of two is equally consistent with a moderate\nevolution in the IGM neutral hydrogen fraction. Relatively\nsmall changes in the highly ionized IGM neutral hydrogen\nfraction can produce a rapid evolution in the observed sizes\nof Ly\u03b1 near-zones if the ionizing flux from the quasar at\nthe edge of the near-zone is comparable to the flux of the\nmetagalactic UV background at the Lyman limit in the\nsurrounding IGM. In this case the rapid evolution can be\nattributed to additional transmission from the thinning\nLy\u03b1 forest. This proposition can be tested by varying the\nflux level used to define the extent of the near-zone sizes.\nFor larger flux levels the evolution should decrease if the\nincreasing transmission from the general Ly\u03b1 forest is\nresponsible for part or most of the evolution.\n\u2022 The effect of self-shielded clumps on the observed sizes\nof the Ly\u03b1 near-zone is small, and the expected evolution\nof the incidence rate of self-shielded clumps appears to\ncontribute little to the rapid evolution of near-zone sizes.\nWe note here that we have not considered two further possibilities which may influence the size of quasar near-zones:\na fluctuating UV background and additional sources of ionizing radiation, such as star forming galaxies, clustered in\nthe vicinity of the quasar host halo. Both of these are likely\nto increase the observed near-zone sizes. Additionally, observational constraints on near-zone sizes are still somewhat\nuncertain, as are quasar ionizing luminosities and lifetimes.\nHowever, a large sample of high quality quasar spectra\nwith an accurate determination of the sizes of the Ly\u03b1 and\n\n\f18\n\nJ.S. Bolton & M.G. Haehnelt\n\nLy\u03b2 near-zones should improve the constraints on the ionization state of the IGM at z > 6 considerably. If most\nquasars exhibit Ly\u03b2 near-zones which are similar in size to\nthe counterpart Ly\u03b1 near-zone, this should favour an IGM\nwith fHI \u2265 10\u22122 . If Ly\u03b2 near-zones were instead generally\nlarger than their Ly\u03b1 counterparts this would provide evidence for an IGM with fHI \u2264 10\u22122 . The information locked\nwithin the widths of absorption features in the Ly\u03b1 nearzones may provide an interesting additional probe of the\nionization state of the IGM at high redshift.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank the referee, Xiaohui Fan, for helpful comments\nwhich substantially improved the clarity of this paper and\nfor kindly providing us with the list of near-zone sizes and\nquasar luminosities used in figures 1, 5 and 8.

These time delay effects, although having\ntheir basis in special relativity with the postulate that the\nspeed of light in empty space always has the same value, are\npurely geometrical rather than relativistic phenomena which\nmanifest themselves when the I-fronts travel at relativistic\nspeeds. The renewed interest in cosmological H II regions as\na probe of the epoch of reionization has meant these effects\nhave been well documented within the recent literature, to\nwhich we refer the interested reader (e.g. White et al. 2003;\nYu & Lu 2005; Yu 2005; Shapiro et al. 2006) However, we\nbriefly review these results here, as they provide an important simplification to our radiative transfer scheme.\nOne can easily show the expression for the radius, R, of\na H II region expanding into a static, pure hydrogen medium\nof constant density and temperature is (e.g. Wyithe & Loeb\n2004; Shapiro et al. 2006)\n\u1e44 \u2212 34 \u03c0R3 \u03b1HII n2H\ndR\n,\n=c\ndt\n\u1e44 + 4\u03c0R2 fHI nH c \u2212 34 \u03c0R3 \u03b1HII n2H\n\n\u0014\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\u0015\n\n(A1)\n\n19\n\nwhere \u1e44 is the number of ionizing photons emitted by the\nmonochromatic source per unit time, nH is the number density of hydrogen atoms, fHI = nHI /nH is the neutral hydrogen fraction and \u03b1HII is the recombination coefficient for\nionized hydrogen. This expression explicitly takes into account the time delay for a photon to travel from the source\nto the edge of the H II region, thus setting the limiting expansion speed of the H II region to the speed of light.\nNow consider the expansion of a H II region outwards\nfrom the ionizing source along the line of sight to an observer. Any photons instantaneously detected by the observer were emitted at the same retarded time, tR = t \u2212 R/c,\nwhere t is the time when the photons reach a distance R\nfrom the source. Evaluating equation A1 at the retarded\ntime yields\n\u1e44 \u2212 43 \u03c0R3 \u03b1HII n2H\ndR\n=\n,\ndtR\n4\u03c0R2 fHI nH\n\n(A2)\n\nwhich is identical to equation (1). Thus, it is clear for\nthis particular geometrical configuration that the expansion\nspeed of the H II region in the observer's frame is no longer\nlimited to the speed of light; it is as if one can completely ignore time delay effects and assume real information is transmitted instantaneously. This leads to the observation of an\ninitial superluminal expansion phase close to the ionizing\nsource, when the number of ionizing photons per hydrogen\natom at the I-front greatly exceeds unity, allowing it to propagate at relativistic speeds. This result is particularly useful\nin the context of our radiative transfer simulations, which\nwe discuss in the next section.\n\nAPPENDIX B: RADIATIVE TRANSFER\nIMPLEMENTATION\nModelling the extent of cosmological H II regions around\nhigh redshift quasars, while consistently tracking local\nchanges in the ionization state and temperature of the gas\ndue to the filtering of ionizing radiation, requires a full treatment of radiative transfer through a hydrogen and helium\nIGM. In a cosmologically expanding medium I-fronts from\na luminous quasar are highly supersonic and thus decoupled\nfrom the hydrodynamical response of the gas. This allows\none to ignore the radiation hydrodynamics of this particular\nproblem, providing a significant simplification to our numerical scheme. For this purpose we use an updated version\nof the radiative transfer algorithm of Bolton et al. (2004).\nThis algorithm is based on the explicit photon conservation method of Abel et al. (1999), which has the desirable\nproperty that photons are conserved almost independently\nof spatial resolution, allowing the accurate determination of\nphysically relevant quantities with only moderate computational expense. We briefly outline the updated algorithm\nhere and then present some tests of the code.\n\nB1\n\nThe cosmological model\n\nWe adopt the following time-redshift relation for a flat\nUniverse dominated by a cosmological constant and nonrelativistic matter (Peebles 1993)\n\n\f20\n\nJ.S. Bolton & M.G.

In\nprinciple, an I-front propagating outwards from the source is\nthen limited to travel no faster than the speed of light since\nni are only evaluated when t \u2265 j\u03b4R/c. However, in practice spatial discretisation means this is not always the case;\nan I-front is assumed to propagate instantaneously across\na cell width \u03b4R. Even for relatively high spatial resolution,\nthis enables the expansion rate of the ionized region to exceed c. This means that to accurately compute the position\nof an I-front one must either increase the spatial resolution\nto a prohibitively high level or artificially impose the limit\nR \u2264 ct. At first glance, the latter option would seem to be\npreferable. However, this has the undesirable effect of violating photon conservation, so that although one correctly\npredicts the position of the I-front (e.g. Abel et al. 1999),\none must again resort to substantially higher spatial resolution (such that each cell in the space grid is optically thin)\nto compute physically relevant quantities within the region\nwhere R \u2264 ct is imposed. This is a problem for simulating quasar near-zones in Lyman series absorption, since the\nabsorption spectrum is sensitive to the exact values of the\nneutral fraction and temperature of the gas near the source.\nFortunately, we have already shown that in the frame of\nan observer the expansion rate of the I-front follows equation (A2). Since we are interested in the sizes of observed\nH II regions, we may evaluate the expression for T\u03bd assuming\nthe photons are transmitted instantaneously, removing the\nneed to impose the condition R \u2264 ct while at the same time\nexplicitly conserving photons. This enables us to determine\nthe ionized fraction and temperature of the gas close to the\nionizing source accurately for relatively coarse spatial resolution, substantially reducing the computational expense of\nthe simulations.\n\nB3\n+ nli \u0393bi ,\n\n\u001a\n\nSimilarly, the photo-heating rate per\n[erg s\u22121 cm\u22123 ] for species i is given by\n\n(B2)\n\nConsider a source which emits \u1e44 ionizing photons per unit\ntime, such that\n\u1e44 =\n\nof element l from the source, \u0393bi is the optically thin photoionization rate due to the diffuse metagalactic UV background and the transmission factor, T\u03bd , is defined as\n\nComputing the ionized fraction and\ntemperature\n\nAt every timestep \u03b4t, in each spatial grid element \u03b4R, the\nionization state and temperature of atomic hydrogen and\nhelium must be computed by solving a set of four coupled\nfirst order ordinary differential equations.

The last term\non the right hand side of equation (B8) is the contribution\nto cooling by the adiabatic expansion of the Universe.\nWe solve equations (B5)-(B8) using a first order implicit\nintegration scheme which provides a good balance between\naccuracy and speed (Anninos et al. 1997). We find that to\nsolve these equations accurately, one must typically adopt a\ntimestep comparable to the hydrogen ionization timescale,\ntion = 1/\u0393HI , which can become very small in close proximity to a luminous source. On occasion this time interval is\nsmaller than the main timestep we use to track the position\nof the I-front (see section C1 for details). When this is the\ncase we sub-cycle over each main time step using smaller\ntime intervals based on the ionization timescale to solve for\nthe ionic abundances. Once the rate of change in the electron number density is less than 10\u22128 , we switch to solving\nthe ionic abundances assuming the gas is in ionization equilibrium (e.g. Katz et al. 1996). This leaves only the differential equation for the temperature to be integrated, allowing\nmuch larger timesteps to be taken which greatly speeds up\nthe calculation.\n\nB4\n\nCross-sections and rates\n\nThe cross-sections and rates adopted in our radiative transfer scheme are listed below.

In\nthis case the H I optical depth per cell is the correct proxy\nto use for the spatial resolution.\nThe results of a spatial resolution test using models A\nand B are shown in figure C1. We have adopted the same\ntime step size,\u01eb = 0.05, in both of these models. We shall\ndiscuss this in more detail shortly. In both models, the propagation of ionizing radiation into a hydrogen and helium\nmedium of uniform density is computed for a source with a\npower-law spectrum situated 2 kpc from the edge of the simulation grid. The left panels show the fractional abundances\nof H I, He II and the gas temperature for model A, with a\nhydrogen number density of 7 \u00d7 10\u22125 cm\u22123 , comparable to\nthe mean density of hydrogen at z = 6. Even adopting cell\nsizes in which the hydrogen is initially very optically thick\nwe find all quantities are recovered with a good degree of\nconvergence. The right hand panels show the same results\nfor model B, which has a hydrogen number density 1000\ntimes greater than model A. Again, the degree of convergence for such optically thick cells is quite remarkable. Note\nthere is evidence that the gas temperature has not fully converged at the lowest spatial resolutions, especially close to\nthe source and near the He III ionization front where there\nare rapid changes in the energy input per ionization. However, we find a spatial resolution of \u03b4R \u2243 10 kpc provides\na good degree of accuracy for the range of parameters we\nshall consider.\nThe second factor we need to consider is the temporal\nresolution. As already discussed in the previous section, potentially the shortest timescale we need to consider is the\nhydrogen ionization timescale tion = 1/\u0393HI . However, this\ntimescale varies locally in the simulation. More generally the\ntimestep size we are interested in is the cell crossing time for\nreal information, which we parameterise using the Courant\ncondition \u01eb, defined as\n\nExploring the limitations of any numerical model is essential\nfor providing well motivated results.

This is because the rate\nof change in the optical depth of each cell is greater per\ntimestep. For fully three-dimensional cosmological radiative\ntransfer with multiple sources this timestep size would be\nsomewhat prohibitive and could be improved upon by using\na form of adaptive timestepping based on the I-front velocity (Shapiro et al. 2004) or time averaged optical depths\n(Mellema et al. 2006). However, for our purpose this simple\ntime stepping scheme is perfectly adequate. Consequently,\nwe adopt a value of \u01eb = 0.1 for our simulations.\n\nC2\n\nPure hydrogen isothermal H\n\nII\n\nregion\n\nModelling the expansion of a H II region into neutral hydrogen gas of uniform density (e.g. Str\u00f6mgren 1939) is one\nof the few radiative transfer problems which has an exact\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nanalytical solution with which one can compare simulation\noutput (Iliev et al. 2006a). We consider two test cases (C\nand D) which simulate the propagation of an H II I-front\ninto an initially neutral pure hydrogen medium of uniform\ndensity and temperature (T = 1.5 \u00d7 104 K). The ionizing\nsource is assumed to be steady and monochromatic, emitting \u1e44 photons per unit time at the Lyman limit.\nWe compare the results of test models C and D to the\nclassical analytical solution, equation (3), in figure C3. The\nsolid lines show the numerical solution for the H I fraction\nat t/107 yrs = [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0] for model C and\nt/107 yrs = [0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 1.0] for model D. The solid\ngrey strips give the analytical solution with a width equal\nto the cell size of the simulation, and hence the uncertainty\nin the numerical result. For this test we adopt a cell size\nof \u03b4R = 20 kpc, with \u01eb = 0.1 for model C and \u01eb = 0.01 for\nmodel D. The agreement between the numerical and analyt-\n\n\f24\n\nJ.S. Bolton & M.G.

We adopt a simple model to include these SSCs within our simulations.

Comparison of test models C (upper panel) and D\n(lower panel) to the analytical solution for the size of a H II region\nin a pure hydrogen medium of constant temperature and density.\nThe solid lines show the numerical solution for the H I fraction\nat t/107 yrs = [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0] for model C and t/107 yrs =\n[0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 1.0] for model D. The centre of the solid grey\nstrips give the analytical solution with the width of the strips\nrepresenting the cell size of the simulation.\n\nFor UV background models 6, 9 and 10, which produce IGM\nneutral fractions consistent with the observational data of\nFan et al. (2006b), this implies \u2206SSC = [4.1, 21.2, 37.5] at\nz = [6.25, 6, 5.75]. Ideally, we would implement this selfshielding for \u2206 \u2265 \u2206SSC within our radiative transfer simulations in the same way as MHR00, by assuming all regions\nwith \u2206 \u2265 \u2206SSC remain neutral while still optically thick to\nionizing radiation. However, although we have shown that\nthe resolution of our hydrodynamical simulation should be\nsufficient for correctly modelling the propagation of ionizing radiation, it still does not quite reach the required mass\nresolution to reproduce the correct number of clumps with\n\u2206 \u2265 \u2206SSC . MHR00 overcome this problem by using an IGM\ndensity distribution drawn from a hydrodynamical simulation, with the addition of a power-law high density tail to\naccount for the lack of high density clumps. The mean free\npath for ionizing photons in their model is given by\n\u03bbmfp =\n\n60\n[1 \u2212 FV (\u2206 < \u2206SSC )]\u22122/3 Mpc,\nH(z)\n\n(D3)\n\nwhere H(z) is the Hubble parameter and FV (\u2206 < \u2206SSC ) is\nthe fraction of the IGM volume with \u2206 < \u2206SSC , computed\nfrom the volume weighted density distribution corrected for\nhigh densities. Assuming \u03bbmfp is similar to the mean distance\nbetween SSCs, which is expected to be a reasonable approximation (Furlanetto & Oh 2005), the number of SSCs per\nunit redshift with \u2206 \u2265 [4.1, 21.2, 37.5] at z = [6.25, 6, 5.75]\nusing the MHR00 model is\ndNSSC\nc\n1\n\u2243\n= [52.5, 9.0, 5.1].\ndz\n\u03bbmfp H(z)(1 + z)\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n(D4)\n\n25\n\nIn comparison, the number of clumps per unit redshift with\n\u2206 \u2265 [4.1, 21.2, 37.5] at z = [6.25, 6, 5.75] within our 4003\nsimulation volume is around a factor of two less than this.\nTherefore, when setting all clumps with \u2206 \u2265 \u2206SSC to be\nneutral within our simulations using UVB models 6, 9 and\n10, we underpredict the mean free path for ionizing photons by about a factor of two. To compensate for this, we\nlower the density threshold at which a clump becomes selfshielded, thus reproducing the required number of SSCs per\nunit redshift given by the MHR00 model, as listed in equation (D4). The relevant density thresholds in our 4003 simulation which reproduce the required number of SSCs per unit\nredshift are \u2206SSC = [2.7, 10.0, 20.0] at z = [6.25, 6, 5.75].\nThus, our simulations using \u2206SSC = [2.7, 10.0, 20.0] and UV\nbackground models 6, 9 and 10 at z = [6.25, 6, 5.75] should\nbe equivalent to using \u2206SSC = [4.1, 21.2, 37.5] with \u03bbmfp =\n[1.09, 6.99, 12.80] Mpc and \u0393b\u221212 = [0.028, 0.280, 0.560]. Assuming ionization equilibrium at \u2206 = 1 and T = 2 \u00d7 104 K,\nthese ionization rates correspond to fHI = [7.3 \u00d7 10\u22124 , 7.3 \u00d7\n10\u22125 , 3.6\u00d710\u22125 ]. However, we note that simulations incorporating radiative transfer which correctly resolve the number\ndensity of SSCs are needed to fully address their effect on\nobserved near-zone sizes.\n\n\f"}
