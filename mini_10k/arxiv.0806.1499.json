However, at RHIC energies, the\nunderlying heavy ion event makes application of conventional jet algorithms difficult. Commonly used jet algorithms employ either fixed-size cones [3], augmented by\nsplit/merging procedures, or iterative clustering (\"k\u22a5 \")\ntechniques [4, 5] to determine the solid angle coverage\nof the jets. The kinematic parameters of the jets are\nobtained by summing over the particles or calorimeter elements within the jet with a constant (i.e. angleindependent) weight. Such a flat weighting may not be\noptimal in the presence of a fluctuating background because a typical jet has most of its energy concentrated\nnear the center of the jet and only a small fraction of the\nenergy in the periphery of the jet. In contrast, an angular\nweighting that enhances the center of the jet compared\n\nFIG. 1: A demonstration of the application of the Gaussian\nfilter to a Pythia event. Final state particle pT are plotted on\nthe bottom Lego plot. The result of the filter is shown with\nthe contour plot on the top surface. Red connecting lines\nindicate reconstructed jet positions.\n\nto the periphery would provide an improved signal to\nbackground in the measurement of the jet energy.\nBackgrounds from the underlying event in hadron\u2013\nhadron collisions or heavy ion collisions or from pile-up\nat high luminosity colliders can also distort the jet finding algorithms themselves. High energy particles from\nthe background can prevent or modify the convergence of\nthe mean-shift iteration in cone algorithms or can modify the order of combination of fragments/proto-jets in\nk\u22a5 algorithms. An algorithm that finds maxima in the\nthe angular distribution of fragment (transverse) energies using a weighting function or filter that is strongly\npeaked has the potential to find the jet position with less\nsensitivity to the presence of background. Such an algorithm also has the advantage of reducing the impact\nof the limited acceptance of certain heavy ion detectors\nused at RHIC and the LHC.\nWe describe in this paper a new algorithm for finding jets and extracting jet kinematic quantities that uses\na linear, Gaussian filter applied in the space of pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle, (\u03b7, \u03c6). Jets are found as\nlocal maxima of the filter output. Because the filter is\nstrongly peaked, the algorithm is expected to improve\nthe reconstruction of jet positions and jet energies in the\npresence of background and to reduce the impact of restricted aperture on jet measurements. This paper takes\nthe first step in exploring the basic characteristics of the\nGaussian filter jet finder by studying its performance on\nPythia simulated p + p events and comparing the performance to two conventional algorithms, the SISCone [6]\nseedless cone algorithm and an implementation [7] of the\nk\u22a5 algorithm.\nWe note that an angular weighting of final state particles has been used previously to define energy flow variables [8], and the algorithm described here is inspired\nby that work. Though we focus here on jet finding and\nenergy estimation, as with energy flow variables, the filtered event shape contains more information than just\nthe locations and energies of reconstructed jets, A previous use of low-pass filtering by Donati et al. [9] should\nalso be recognized. However, that work only used the filter to bootstrap other clustering algorithms, while in this\nwork, filtering is used for complete jet reconstruction.\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 2: Filter reconstructed Pythia jet pT distribution function for pT,k\u22a5 , pT,SISCone \u2208 {4, 8, 16} GeV/c \u00b1 250 MeV/c,\nrespectively.

However, discrete digital filtering provide an\nefficient mean to calculate p\u0303T (\u03b7, \u03c6) for a large number of\nsample points. Thus one could find every possible maximum, i.e. in the analogy of the cone algorithm, achieving \"seedlessnes\" by means of sufficiently sample the entire (\u03b7, \u03c6) range with a number of seeds N = N\u03b7 N\u03c6 \u226b\n\nFIG. 3: Pythia jet multiplicity of jets with pT \u2265 2 GeV/c,\nwith pT,trig = 8 GeV/c for the filter, k\u22a5 , and SISCone algorithms\n\n2\u03c0\u2206\u03b7/R02 , with R0 \u2248 0.2 being the characteristic separation of close jet pairs, and \u2206\u03b7 = \u03b7max \u2212 \u03b7min the pseudorapidity range (typically that of the collider experiment\ncalorimetry).\nTherefore we implement (2) by a multistage algorithm,\nconsisting of the following steps:\n1. Accumulate a rectangularly binned pT density of\nthe event. This can be thought as a pT histogram, or in term of the density distribution (1)\nand modulo a constant normalization, to approximate (\u03b7i , \u03c6i ) by a discretized (\u03b7\u0302i , \u03c6\u0302i ) for each i,\nwith \u03b7\u0302 = \u230a(\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7min )N\u03b7 /\u2206\u03b7\u230b\u2206\u03b7/N\u03b7 + \u03b7min (and \u230a*\u230b\ndenoting the floor function) being the discretized\npseudo-rapidity, and analogously for \u03c6\u0302.\n2. Apply the discrete realization of the filter on the\nbinned density to obtain the initial p\u0303T (\u03b7\u0302, \u03c6\u0302) approximation for the discrete (\u03b7\u0302, \u03c6\u0302) bins or pixels.\nThis filter could be either implemented in the (\u03b7, \u03c6)\nposition space using e.g. a finite impulse response\n(FIR) or infinite impulse response (IIR) version of\nthe filter, or realized in the Fourier space.\n3. The local maxima are localized by comparing the\nfiltered pT density of each discrete pixel against\nthat of the surrounding pixels.\n4. The set of locally maximal pixel centers (\u03b7\u0302, \u03c6\u0302) is\nused to initialize a suitable local optimization algorithm, operating on the unbinned pT density (1),\nto obtain the true (\u03b7, \u03c6) positions.\nA jet definition like (2) is inherently collinearly and infrared safe, as p\u0303T (\u03b7, \u03c6) is a non-iteratively defined quantity not involving any thresholds or cutoffs, and therefore\nlike event shape variables such as thrust, is neither sensitive to infinitely soft radiation, nor collinear splitting.\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 4: Triggered Pythia jet spectrum, left with pT,trig = 8 GeV/c, comparing different algorithm and size \u03c3 selection, and\nto the middle comparing filter \u03c3 = 0.5 and \u03c3 = 0.7, respectively, against SISCone R = 2\u22121/2 \u2248 0.707 and for different\npT,trig \u2208 {4, 8, 16} GeV/c\n\nWhen implemented properly, the maximum finding only\ndepends on the collinearly and infrared safe p\u0303T (\u03b7, \u03c6).\nFor the filtering kernel, we would like to propose a bivariate Gaussian distribution function with the normalization h(0, 0) = 1,\n\u0002\n\u0003\nh(\u03b7, \u03c6) = exp \u2212(\u03b7 2 + \u03c62ar )/(2\u03c3 2 ) ,\n(3)\n\nwith \u03c6ar := 2\u03c0\u2308(\u03c6 + \u03c0)/(2\u03c0)\u2309 \u2212 \u03c0 (and \u2308*\u2309 denoting the\nceiling function) being the angularly reduced azimuth.\nThe parameter \u03c3 determines the radial scale of the jet reconstruction, analogous to the fixed-cone radius R. Figure 1 illustrates the Gaussian filter applied to a Pythia\nevent, and a comparison of the filter reconstructed jet\npT distribution functions for jets that the k\u22a5 algorithm\nand SISCone reconstruct to pT = 4, 8, and 16 GeV/c is\nshown in Figure 2.\nThe mean shift iteration (such as the cone algorithm)\nis closely related to a bound maximization with respect\nto the convolution with a \"shadow function\" [10, 11].\nThis has the consequence that for the pure jet direction finding, the filtering based algorithm with subsequent maximization presented here has an exact correspondence in the picture of a weighted mean shift iteration, and therefore can be regarded as a generalized form\nof the cone algorithm. The correspondence also leads\nnaturally to the definition of jets as the local maxima in\n(2). For the cone algorithm, the shadow function kernel\nis h(\u03b7, \u03c6) = max[0, 1 \u2212 (\u03b7 2 + \u03c62 )/R2 ]. Comparing this\nwith the functional form of (3) suggest for the limit of\nnarrowly focused jet, the angular behavior of the Gaussian filter and the cone algorithm \u221a\n(without split/merge)\nwould correspond with the choice 2\u03c3 = R.\nThere are several reasons to prefer a Gaussian density\ndistribution instead of e.g. the parabolic shadow function\nimplied by the cone algorithm. A Gaussian density does\nnot possess the undesirable feature of maximum creation\n\n(or in the language of a cone iteration, stable midpoint\naxes). And when a slow varying background is present,\nthe foreground to background ratio is accounted for both\nin the reconstructed jet energy and the directional jet\nfinding, since the Gaussian weighting is present in both\np\u0303T (\u03b7, \u03c6) and its gradient. As a rapidly decreasing test\nfunction, the Gaussian density possesses the mathematical property necessary to regulate the singular (\u03b7, \u03c6) directional distribution of an outgoing high-pT fragment in\n(1).\nGaussian filtering has been used extensively in fields\nsuch as computer vision, and several fast approximations\nare known beside the direct and Fourier space convolution. We use a partial fraction expanded form [12] of\nthe IIR approximation originally described by Young &\nvan Vliet [13, 14, 15], which compared to a fast Fourier\ntransform (FFT) realization requires no padding along\nthe pseudo-rapidity axis, but at least two filtering passes\nto simulate a circular response in azimuth. It should be\nnoted that multi-pass filtering does not exactly reproduce\nin the the angularly truncated Gaussian distribution as\nin (3), but rather the sum of its circular frequency components, and the filtering kernel therefore in fact takes\nthe form\n\u0001\n2\n2\n2\nh(\u03b7, \u03c6) = (2\u03c0)\u22121/2 |\u03c3|e\u2212\u03b7 /(2\u03c3 ) \u03b83 \u03c6/2, e\u2212\u03c3 /2 ,\nwith \u03b83 being the Jacobi theta function [16]. The difference is however negligible for all meaningful choices\nof \u03c3 \u226a \u03c0, especially at the initial, approximate stage of\nfiltering.\nAs input to the filter we consider final state particles\nwithin an acceptance of |\u03b7| < 8. The discrete filtering\noperates on a N\u03b7 = 640, N\u03c6 = 256 grid. For the continuous maximization, we use the Newton optimization\nalgorithm with analytically calculated gradient and Hessian, and for robustness, modified to handle of indefinite\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 5: Pythia di-jet event jet opening angle with pT,trig =\n8 GeV/c for the filter and k\u22a5 algorithms\n\nFIG. 6: Pythia di-jet event pT sum with pT,trig = 8 GeV/c for\nthe filter and k\u22a5 algorithms, with the k\u22a5 convolved by the\nfilter to k\u22a5 energy scale ratio. A Gaussian and exponential\nfit for the low and high inbalance, respectively, are shown.\n\nHessian by spectral decomposition.\n\nIII.\n\nSIMULATION AND EVENT SELECTION\n\nIn order to assess the performance of jet reconstruction by filtering, we compared the reconstructed jets\nagainst the k\u22a5 and cone algorithms at the ideal detector level, by using event generator truth particles from\nPythia 6.4.16 [17].\nFor all comparisons we\n\u221a present here, we consider the\np + p collision system at s = 200 GeV, which as of Run8 accounts for approximately 170 pb\u22121 of the hadronic\nRHIC operating mode. The k\u22a5 algorithm used is the KtJet [7] implementation in the inclusive clustering mode,\nwith the inclusive stopping parameter D = 1 and the longitudinally invariant QCD distance scheme [4]. We further compare against SISCone [6], a variant of the cone\nalgorithm, with the overlap threshold parameter f = 0.5\nand the cone radius R = 2\u22121/2 \u2248 0.707, close to the\ntypically used R = 0.7 and in asymptotic angular correspondence to the Gaussian filter with \u03c3 = 0.5 for narrow\njets. Each of the comparison presented here are based on\n106 (triggered) Pythia events.\nTwo form of triggering were used. For the event multiplicity, di-jet and three jet balance (Figures 3, 5, 6, 7), we\nare comparing two algorithms at a certain scale of hard\nscattering. Here we triggered on the Pythia hard scattering p\u0302T,2\u21922 with a centered, 500 MeV wide window, i.e.\nwith pT,trig \u22120.25 GeV/c \u2264 p\u0302T,2\u21922 \u2264 pT,trig +0.25 GeV/c,\nand obtained the differential cross sections per unit trigger window at the triggered pT,trig . The same applies to\nthe triggered pT spectrum that illustrates the sensitivity\nto soft QCD background (Figure 4). For the comparison of filter reconstructed pT against the reconstructed\npT of the k\u22a5 and cone algorithms (Figure 2), we used a\nlarge trigger window with p\u0302T,2\u21922 \u2265 pT,trig \u2212 2.25 GeV/c\n\nto avoid biasing the jet, and the results are shown as\nnormalized probability density functions.\nTo test the di-jet balance of the filtering algorithm,\nwe arrange the reconstructed jets in descending pT , i.e.\npT,1 \u2265 pT,2 \u2265 * * * \u2265 pT,N . Events with a prominent dijet structure can be selected by requiring pT,3 < gpT,2 ,\nwith g < 1 as the relative pT gap, which we chose to\nbe 14 . This approach avoids sensitivity to the individual\nenergy scales of the algorithm. In the pairwise comparision, the selection is applied on both jet algorithms in the\nlogical \"and\" sense to ensure symmetric event selection\n(i.e. both algorithms agree that a clear dijet structure is\npresent).\nAn analogous selection for the three jet events can be\nmade by requiring pT,4 < gpT,3 (with the same g = 41\n\nFIG. 7: Pythia three jet event jet opening angle with pT,trig =\n8 GeV/c for the filter and k\u22a5 algorithms\n\n\f5\nchoice as with the di-jet event selection). If the pairwise angle among the three leading jets are \u03c612 , \u03c623 , \u03c631 ,\nthe resulting three jet opening angle is defined as \u2206\u03c6 :=\nmin(\u03c612 , \u03c623 , \u03c631 ). Since three algorithms are compared\nin Figure 7, we used the logical \"or\" sense (i.e. only one\nalgorithm detecting a clear three jet structure is sufficient).\nThe inbalance expressed by the three momentum pT\nsum scales with the pT scale the jet algorithm reconstructs to. Therefore the comparison is made against the\nk\u22a5 algorithm with the momentum sum convoluted by\nthe pT,filter /pT,k\u22a5 distribution function, i.e. if one would\n\"simulate\" the filter behavior by apply the distribution\nfunction event by event to the k\u22a5 algorithm.\nWhile not explicitly shown, we also checked our results\nagainst herwig 5.6.10 [18], and found no algorithm specific, dissimilar behaviors, beside differences among the\nevent generators that are reproduced by all algorithms.\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nparticles, thus creating the large jet multiplicity visible in Figure 3, while the Gaussian filter suppresses the\nbackground approximately by a factor of 2 at an initial\nhard scattering of 8 GeV/c, thus producing a significantly\nmore isolated and prominent peak for the trigger. This\neffect is consistent over a range of filter sizes and pT,trig ,\nand becomes even stronger with increasing filter size or\nat lower pT,trig . While SISCone e.g. fails to resolve the\nhard scattering cross section peak at 4 GeV/c from the\nbackground for any choice of R < \u03c02 , this is possible with\nthe filter algorithm and \u03c3 & 0.8, albeit not at \u03c3 = 0.5.\nIn di-jet events, the Gaussian filter reproduces the\nangular behavior that previous jet reconstruction algorithms exhibit (Figures 5), and a slight difference in the\nthree momentum sum is visible, with the filter having a\nslightly weaker exponential tail (Figure 6). The similarities are expected, since with adequate jet reconstruction\nperformance, these variables should be dominated by the\nphysical processes rather than the jet definitions. There\nis also a slight difference in the three jet opening angle\nwhen compared to the k\u22a5 algorithm (7), and difference\nto the k\u22a5 algorithm is smaller than the k\u22a5 algorithm to\nSISCone.\n\nThe prominent feature of jet reconstruction by filtering is the effect of the angular weight. It has the effect\nthat the reconstructed jet pT is shifted for wide angle\nfragmentation, while becoming less noticeable for sharply\nfocused, high pT jets (Figure 2). This accounts for the\nperformance of the filter algorithm in the rejection of the\nsoft background, which usually only contributes significantly to the event pT when summed over large angles.\nThis inherent discrimination against the background provide us with a good start position to apply the formalism\npresented here to stronger background levels, including\nthose usually found in heavy ion collisions. And while\nthis effect complicates the determination of jet pT , the\nparameter dependent shift of jet pT and the subsequent\nneed for calibration is present with all jet reconstruction\nalgorithms.\nTo show the insensitivity to the background, we calculated both the jet multiplicity and jet pT specturm at\n8 GeV/c initial hard scattering. In term of the jet multiplicity (Figure 3), the filtering reproduces more accurately an initial hard scattering like event shape, which\nis dominated by two and three jet events.\nThe pT spectra (Figure 4) shows a two component mixture, consisting of a high jet cross section, low pT exponential distribution resulting from the soft QCD background, and a peak from the triggered, initial hard scattering. Here both the k\u22a5 algorithm and SISCone in\nfact produce a large amount of \"jets\" from background\n\nIn this paper, we presented a new algorithm for jet\nreconstruction by filtering, that beside essential pQCD\nproperties of collinear and infrared safety, provides robustness against soft background. Applied on event generator final state particles, we showed that its performance in key areas matches the k\u22a5 algorithm and SISCone, such as for the di-jet balance and three jet opening angle, which are given by the physical jet production\nand jet fragmentation and not significantly modified by\nthe jet definition. While the pT scale differs from the\nreconstructed scale of the k\u22a5 and cone algorithms, we\nnote that an energy calibration is usually required for\nall algorithms for the extraction of the accurate parton\nenergy. We also demonstrated, in this paper for p+ p collisions, its superior ability in discriminating jets from the\nbackground, thus rejecting the associated, spurious jets\ncontaminating events at low pT . We hope to apply the\nalgorithm presented here to most of the collision systems\navailable at RHIC and LHC, thus providing an unified\njet definition suitable across a large range of species, collision energies and jet pT that so far was not attainable\nwith the traditional jet reconstruction algorithms.\n\n[1] K.
