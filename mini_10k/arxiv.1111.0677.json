Introduction\nPrecision tests of the standard model from flavor factory and intensity frontier experiments\ncan reveal new physics even if the accelerator energy isn't sufficient to create the new particles\nassociated with the new physics. Here preliminary results of a lattice-QCD calculation of the\nnonzero-recoil form factor for the semileptonic process B \u2192 Dl\u03bd are presented. The principal goal\nis to determine |Vcb | to a high precision. The theoretical uncertainty on |Vcb | limits the precision of\nthe unitarity triangle constraint from neutral kaon mixing.\nThere are several methods for determining |Vcb |. (1) From the inclusive decay b \u2192 cl\u03bd , perturbation theory and the operator product expansion provide an estimate of the inclusive decay rate,\nwhich is then combined with the measured decay rate to obtain |Vcb | [1]. (2) From the exclusive\nsemileptonic decay B \u2192 D\u2217 l\u03bd , lattice-QCD methods provide the hadronic contribution to the decay\nrate [2]. For the special case of zero recoil, we have presented an unquenched calculation for this\nprocess three years ago [3] with a preliminary update reported at the Lattice 2010 [4] and CKM\n2010 conferences [5] (3) Likewise, from the exclusive semileptonic decay B \u2192 Dl\u03bd , lattice-QCD\nmethods provide the hadronic contribution [8]. Here we report the first unquenched lattice-QCD\ncalculation for this process at nonzero recoil.\nAt present there is a 1.6 \u03c3 disagreement between the value of |Vcb | determined from inclusive\ndecays and our recent preliminary value based on the decay B \u2192 D\u2217 l\u03bd at zero recoil, as illustrated\nin Fig. 1. Thus, further cross checks of and improvements in the theoretical calculations are needed.\nThe value of |Vcb | can be determined from the ratio of the measured decay rate to the calculated\nhadronic form factor at any chosen recoil energy. Typically, the uncertainty in the experimental\nmeasurement increases as the recoil energy vanishes [12], whereas the uncertainty in the latticeQCD calculation decreases [6, 7, 8]. Thus, to minimize the uncertainty in the ratio, it is best to\ncombine results of the experimental measurement with those of the lattice-QCD calculation over\nthe full range of available recoil energies. For this reason we undertake an analysis over a broad\nrange.\n\n2. Methodology for determining |Vcb |\nThe hadronic weak matrix element for this process is commonly parameterized as\n\u221a\n(w)(v + v\u2032 )\u03bc + hB\u2192D\n(w)(v \u2212 v\u2032 )\u03bc ] .\nhD(p\u2032 )|V\u03bc |B(p)i = mB mD [hB\u2192D\n+\n\u2212\n\n(2.1)\n\nFigure 1: The central values and errors resulting from three determinations of |Vcb |: (1) A \"global fit\" to\nthe unitarity triangle including all inputs except |Vcb | [9] [10], (2) inclusive measurements summarized by\nthe HFAG [11], and (3) our B \u2192 D\u2217 lattice-QCD calculation [4, 5].\n\n2\n\n\fSemileptonic B \u2192 Dl \u03bd decays at nonzero recoil\n\nSi-Wei Qiu\n\nHere, w is velocity transfer, w = v * v\u2032 . The differential rate for the semileptonic decay B \u2192 Dl\u03bd is\nd\u0393(B \u2192 Dl \u03bd ) G2F |Vcb |2\n=\n(mB + mD )2 m3D [w2 \u2212 1]3/2 |GB\u2192D (w)|2 ,\ndw\n48\u03c0 3\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere GB\u2192D (w) is defined as\nmB \u2212 mD B\u2192D\nh\n(w) .\nmB + mD \u2212\n\nGB\u2192D (w) = hB\u2192D\n(w) \u2212\n+\n\n(2.3)\n\nThus, once we know hB\u2192D\nand hB\u2192D\n, we can determine the form factor GB\u2192D (w). Then, combin+\n\u2212\ning it with the result of the decay rate from experiment, we will obtain |Vcb |. In order to construct\n, we need the following quantities:\nand hB\u2192D\nhB\u2192D\n\u2212\n+\nh+ (w) = R+ (p)[1 \u2212 x f (p)R\u2212 (p)],\n\nh\u2212 (w) = R+ (p)[1 \u2212 R\u2212 (p)/x f (p)],\n4\n\nR+ (p) = hD(p)|V |B(0)i,\nhD(p)|V 1 |B(0)i\nR\u2212 (p) =\n,\nhD(p)|V 4 |B(0)i\nhD(p)|V 1 |D(0)i\n,\nx f (p) =\nhD(p)|V 4 |D(0)i\n\n(2.4)\n(2.5)\n(2.6)\n(2.7)\n(2.8)\n\nwhere V \u03bc is the continuum hadronic weak vector current.\nIn our calculation we use the local (nonconserved) lattice vector current V\u03bc (x) = \u03a8\u0304b (x)i\u03b3\u03bc \u03a8c (x)\nwith O(a) improved heavy quark fields \u03a8h (x) following [13], and we renormalize it following a\npartly nonperturbative method, namely\nZV bc = \u03c1V\n\np\n\nZV bb ZV cc ,\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhere the flavor-diagonal renormalization coefficients are computed nonperturbatively on the lattice via the conditions\nZV bb hB|V 4 |Bi = 1,\n4\n\nZV cc hD|V |Di = 1,\n\n(2.10)\n(2.11)\n\nand \u03c1V is computed perturbatively [7]. Because of cancellations among similar loop diagrams, we\nexpect that \u03c1V is nearly equal to 1 [7].

The ensembles in bold have been\nanalyzed for this report. Light(strange) sea quark masses are denoted by ml (mh ).\n\n3. Results\nWe report on results from an analysis of a large set of gauge field ensembles generated in the\npresence of 2 + 1 flavors of improved staggered (asqtad) quarks [14, 15]. Further ensembles will\nbe included in the future. Some key ensemble parameters are listed in Table 3.\nOn each ensemble we compute the three-point correlation functions relevant to the weak matrix elements and the two-point functions relevant to the propagation of the B and D mesons. For\nthe heavy-light mesons we use heavy clover quarks in the Fermilab interpretation and light, improved staggered (asqtad) quarks [14, 15]. We use two types of interpolating operators for the\nB and D mesons, namely local and smeared using the 1S Richardson wave function. We set the\nvalence-quark masses equal to the sea-quark masses. The bare lattice charm and bottom quark\nmasses are fixed by matching the kinetic masses of the Ds and Bs mesons, respectively, to their\nexperimental values. Some small adjustments will be needed to refine this tuning but are not yet\nincluded in this preliminary analysis.\nIn terms of interpolating operators OB and OD for the B and D mesons and the vector current,\nthe two-point and three-point functions are given by\nC2pt (t; p) =\n\n\u2211 exp(ip * x)hO(x,t)O \u2020 (0)i\nx\n\n=\n\n\u2211 stn Zn(p)[exp(\u2212En(p)t) + exp(\u2212En(p)(Nt \u2212 t))]\n\n(3.1)\n\n\u2211 exp(ip * y)hOD (0)V\u03bc (y,t)OB\u2020 (x, T )i ,\n\n(3.2)\n\nn\n\n(t, T ; p) =\nCV3pt,B\u2192D\n\u03bc\n\nx,y\n\nwhere sn = \u00b11 accounts for contributions that oscillate in t, and Nt is the lattice extent in the t\ndimension. Note that in the three-point function above, we have put the D meson at the origin and\nthe B meson at (x, T ).\nThe matrix elements we want from Eq. (2.6) to Eq. (2.8) are obtained by factorization and\nreduction of the three-point functions. The reduction is based on the overlap coefficients Zn (p),\nenergies and masses obtained in fits to the two-point functions. For example, the R+ (p) matrix\nelement is obtained from\ns\nCV3pt,B\u2192D\n(t,\nT\n;\np)\nZD (0)ED EDt\u2212 1 mD T \u2212mB (t\u2212 1 T )\n4\n2\n2\ne\n(3.3)\ne\nR+ (t, T ; p) = q\nC3pt,D\u2192D (t, T ; 0)C3pt,B\u2192B (t, T ; 0) ZD (p)mD\nV4\n\nV4\n\n4\n\n\fSemileptonic B \u2192 Dl \u03bd decays at nonzero recoil\n\nSi-Wei Qiu\n\nin the limit t \u2192 \u221e and T \u2212t \u2192 \u221e. In that limit it is a constant, R+ (p), independent of t. However, at\nfinite t and T , complications from oscillating terms and excited states must be taken into account.\nBecause they contain a light staggered quark, the meson interpolating operators excite evenas well as odd-parity channels. The unwanted even-parity states manifest themselves as terms that\noscillate in t, corresponding to terms in the two-point and three-point functions with sn = \u22121. To\nsuppress the effect of the oscillating terms in the three-point functions, we average in both t and T\n(after removing the dominant exponential dependence on t as in Eq. (3.3)) as follows:\n1\n1\n1\nR \u2261 R(0,t, T ) + R(0,t, T + 1) + R(0,t + 1, T + 1) .\n(3.4)\n2\n4\n4\nHere, R refers to any of the quantities derived from three-point functions, such as R+ , R\u2212 , and x f .\nHaving suppressed the contributions of the oscillating states to the three-point correlators, we\nmust still account for contributions from excited states. For example, for D \u2192 D, the leading\ncontributions are\np\np\ne\u2212EDt\ne\u2212ED\u2032 t\ne\u2212mD (T \u2212t) p\nZD (0) + ZD\u2032 (p) \u221a\nhD|V4 |Di \u221a\nCV3ptD\u2192D\n(p,t) = ZD (p) \u221a\n4\n2ED\u2032\n2ED\n2mD\np\ne\u2212mD\u2032 (T \u2212t) p\ne\u2212mD (T \u2212t) p\ne\u2212EDt\nhD|V4 |D\u2032 i \u221a\n\u00d7hD\u2032 |V4 |Di \u221a\nZD (0) + ZD (p) \u221a\nZD\u2032 (0) , (3.5)\n2mD\u2032\n2mD\n2ED\nwhere the primes indicate the overlaps and energies of the excited states of the same parity. We have\nneglected the doubly excited contribution, since the singly excited contribution is found already to\nbe small. Thus, at finite t and T the ratio R+ (t, T ; p) in Eq. (3.3) is not constant, but has a small\ncontamination from excited states. We take this into account by fitting the resulting ratio to\nR+ (p,t, T ) = R+ (p) exp(\u03b4 mt) + A exp(\u2212\u2206ED t) + B exp(\u2212\u2206mB (T \u2212 t))\n\n(3.6)\n\nas illustrated in Fig. 2. The fit parameter \u03b4 m should be zero, but it is introduced to allow for\na small error in determining ED and mB . The other terms involve \u2206ED = ED\u2032 \u2212 ED and \u2206mB =\nmB\u2032 \u2212 mB . These parameters are obtained from the fits of two-point functions. The results of twopoint function fits then become prior central values and widths for fitting R+ (t, T ; p). We use a\nsimilar method to obtain R\u2212 (p) and x f (p).\n\n4. Chiral and continuum extrapolation\nTo complete the analysis we will extrapolate in the light quark masses to their physical values\nand take the continuum limit, using staggered chiral perturbation theory [16, 17] . At this preliminary stage, we don't show physical values and chiral fit in this report. The numerical data points\nfor h+ and h\u2212 are shown in Fig. 3. We will need these data points to finish the extrapolation of\nphysical value of h+ and h\u2212 and the chiral fit.\n\n5. Future plans\nTo complete the project, we need to (1) finish analyzing the available ensembles, (2) make\nadjustments for the tuning of the heavy quark masses, (3) compute the current renormalization (\u03c1V\nfactor), and (4) combine the experimental results for the differential decay rate with our results for\nthe form factor to obtain |Vcb |, using methods employed for |Vub | to extend w over the full kinematic\nrange [18].\n5\n\n\fSemileptonic B \u2192 Dl \u03bd decays at nonzero recoil\n\nSi-Wei Qiu\n\nFigure 2: A sample fit to R+ (t, T ; p).
