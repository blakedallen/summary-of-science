As\nembryos grow, the velocities of remnant planetesimals are increased so greatly that collisions be-\n\nIntroduction\n\nGas giant planets such as Jupiter and Saturn form in gaseous disks. In the core-accretion\nmodel, the accretion of planetesimals produces\ncores of giant planets. Once a core reaches a\ncritical mass \u223c 10 Earth masses, it can rapidly\naccrete gas to form a gas giant planet (Mizuno\n1980; Bodenheimer & Pollack 1986; Ikoma et al.\n2000). Gas giants must form within the lifetime\nof gaseous disks (. 10 Myr).\nFor km-sized or larger planetesimals, gravitational focusing enhances their collisional cross sections, resulting in a high collision probability for\nlow relative velocities. Relative velocities of large\nbodies are kept lower than those of small ones due\nto dynamical friction. A combination of gravita-\n\n1\n\n\ftween planetesimals become destructive. Such\ncollisions eject numerous fragments, which collide with each other to produce further smaller\nbodies. Planetesimals are therefore ground down\nthrough such successive collisions (collision cascade). The random velocities of small bodies are\nstrongly damped by gas drag and thereby the collisional cascade no longer occurs for fragments with\nradii . 1\u201310 m. In the end such fragments drift\ninward due to gas drag and are lost around embryos. The collisional cascade combined with the\nloss of fragments reduces the solid surface density\nand hence final embryo masses. Kobayashi et al.\n(2010) showed that the final embryo masses are as\nsmall as Mars mass for 1-100 km-sized planetesimals in the minimum mass solar nebula (hereafter\nMMSN; Hayashi 1981).\nLarge planetesimals,\nwhich are relatively hard to be broken collisionally, and a massive disk produce massive final embryos. However, collisional fragmentation makes\nit difficult to form giant planets along the lines\nof the core-accretion model; starting from 100 kmsized planetesimals, planetary embryos can reach\nthe critical core mass for gas accretion only inside\n3\u20134 AU in a disk that is 10 times more massive\nthan the MMSN model.\nThe motion of fragments . 1 m is coupled with\ngas. The drift timescale of such fragments are relatively long. Kenyon & Bromley (2009) proposed\nthat embryos may accrete a large amount of such\nfragments. However, the strong gas drag in the\nStokes regime is dominant for fragments . 100 m\nand damps the relative velocities to halt collision\ncascade at 1\u201310 m as mentioned above. Therefore,\nonly a small amount of coupled bodies are produced and hence they hardly contribute to embryo\ngrowth (Kobayashi et al. 2010).\nMany authors have investigated embryo growth\nwith N -body, statistical, and hybrid simulations (Kokubo & Ida 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002;\nInaba et al. 1999, 2001, 2003; Weidenschilling et al.\n1997; Weidenschilling 2005, 2008; Kenyon & Bromley\n2004, 2008; Chambers 2006, 2008; Kobayashi et al.\n2010). Although providing most accurate dynamical results, N -body simulations have difficulty\nin producing numerous fragments and following\ntheir fate. The fragmentation effect on embryo\ngrowth has thus not been treated in detail in spite\nof its importance. Recently, Levison et al. (2010)\nincluded fragment production in their N -body\n\nsimulation. However, it is still difficult to treat\nfragment\u2013fragment collisions. Such successive collisions are essential in the collision cascade (e.g.,\nKobayashi & Tanaka 2010). Therefore, statistical simulations are a better method to accurately\ninvestigate planet formation with fragmentation.\nIn the statistical simulation, the collisional\nmass evolution of bodies is calculated within a\n\"particle-in-a-box\" approximation. Bodies have\nhorizontal and vertical components of random velocity relative to a circular orbit that are determined by their eccentricities and inclinations, respectively. These velocities are changed by gravitational interactions between the bodies and hence\naffected by their mass spectrum, while the collision rates between the bodies depend on the velocities. Therefore, the coupled mass and velocity\nevolution needs to be solved (Wetherill & Stewart\n1993). While the statistical method has advantages, its weak point is the inability to\ntrack the individual positions of planetesimals.\nHowever, progress in planetary dynamic theory\n(Greenzweig & Lissauer 1992; Ida & Nakazawa\n1989; Ohtsuki 1999; Stewart & Ida 2000; Ohtsuki et al.\n2002) has helped to overcome this problem.\nFor example, Greenzweig & Lissauer (1992) and\nIda & Nakazawa (1989) provided detailed expressions for the probability of collisions between planetesimals orbiting a central star, while\nStewart & Ida (2000) and Ohtsuki et al. (2002)\nderived improved equations for calculating the\nevolution of random planetesimal velocities caused\nby gravitational interactions. Finally, it has\nbeen shown that the recently developed statistical codes can describe some aspects of the planetary accumulation processes with the same accuracy as N -body simulations (Inaba et al. 2001;\nKobayashi et al. 2010).\nSince the timescale of collision cascade strongly\naffects the final mass of planetary embryos (Kobayashi et al.\n2010), fragmentation outcome models are essential for embryo growth.\nCollisional fragmentation includes several uncertain parameters. Kobayashi & Tanaka (2010) constructed\na simple fragmentation model which is consistent with laboratory experiments (Fujiwara et al.\n1977; Takagi et al. 1984; Holsapple 1993) and\nhydrodynamical simulations (Benz & Asphaug\n1999) and analytically clarified which parameters are essential. They found that the mass de2\n\n\fpletion due to collision cascades is sensitive to\nthe total ejecta mass yielded by a single collision, while it is almost independent of the mass\nof the largest ejecta fragment and the size distribution of ejecta over a realistic parameter region. Furthermore, fragmenting collisions are subdivided into two types, catastrophic disruption\nand cratering (erosive collision). Although some\nstudies neglected or underestimated the effect of\ncratering (Dohnanyi 1969; Williams & Wetherill\n1994; Wetherill & Stewart 1993; Inaba et al. 2003;\nBottke et al. 2005), Kobayashi & Tanaka showed\nthat cratering collisions make a dominant contribution to the collision cascade.\nA planetary embryo larger than \u223c 10\u22122 Earth\nmasses acquires a tenuous atmosphere of gas from\nthe disk. Fragments are captured by the atmosphere even if they do not collide directly with\nthe embryo, implying that the collisional cross\nsection of the embryo is enhanced. This effect advances the growth of Mars-mass or larger\nembryos (Inaba & Ikoma 2003). Embryos with\nthe atmospheres accrete fragments prior to their\ndrift inward and can acquire more than 10 Earth\nmasses starting from 10km-sized planetesimals\n(Inaba et al. 2003). However, erosive collisions\nand initial planetesimal sizes strongly affect final\nembryo masses (Kobayashi et al. 2010).\nThis paper investigates the embryo growth taking into account erosive collisions and embryo's\natmosphere. Although growing embryos may fall\ninto a central star due to the type I migration (e.g.,\nTanaka et al. 2002), we neglect the migration here.\nWe perform both analytical studies and statistic\nsimulations, which extend those of Kobayashi et\nal. (2010) by including atmospheric enhancement\nof embryo growth. The goal is to find out what determines embryo growth and whether an embryo\ncan reach the critical core mass. We introduce\nthe theoretical model in Section 2 and derive final\nembryo masses taking into account atmosphere in\nSection 3. In Section 4, we check solutions for final masses against the statistical simulations. Sections 5 and 6 contain a discussion and a summary\nof our findings.\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nTHEORETICAL MODEL\nDisk Model\n\nWe introduce a power-law disk model for the\ninitial surface mass density of solids \u03a3s,0 and gas\n\u03a3g,0 such that\n\u03a3s,0\n\n=\n\n\u03a3gas,0\n\n=\n\n\u0010 a \u0011\u2212q\ng cm\u22122 ,\n1AU\n\u0010 a \u0011\u2212q\nfgas \u03a31\ng cm\u22122 ,\n1AU\nfice \u03a31\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nwhere a is a distance from a central star, \u03a31 is\nthe reference surface density at 1 AU, and q is the\npower-law index of the radial distribution. The\ngas-dust ratio fgas = 240 (Hayashi 1981). The factor fice that represents the increase of solid density\nby ice condensation beyond the snow line aice is\ngiven by fice = 1 (a < aice ) and 4.2 (a \u2265 aice ). In\nthe MMSN model, \u03a31 = 7.1 g cm\u22122 and q = 3/2.\nIf the disk is optically thin,\naice = 2.7\n\n\u0012\n\nL\u2217\nL\u2299\n\n\u00131/2\n\nAU,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere L\u2217 and L\u2299 are the luminosities of the central star and the sun, respectively. In reality, disks\nmay be optically thick even after planetesimal formation. However, we assume Equation (3) for simplicity.\n2.2.\n\nFragmentation Outcome Model\n\nKobayashi & Tanaka (2010) showed erosive collisions to dominate the collision cascade. We\nshould take into account such collisions properly. We assume that fragmentation outcomes are\nscaled by the impact energy and hence the total\nejecta mass me produced by a single collision between m1 and m2 is given by a function of the dimensionless impact energy \u03c6 = m1 m2 v 2 /2(m1 +\nm2 )2 Q\u2217D , where v is the collisional velocity between m1 and m2 and Q\u2217D is the specific energy needed for me = (m1 + m2 )/2. Following\nKobayashi & Tanaka (2010) and Kobayashi et al.\n(2010), we model\n\u03c6\nme\n=\n.\nm1 + m2\n1+\u03c6\n\n(4)\n\nInaba et al. (2003) derived me from the fragment model developed by Wetherill & Stewart\n3\n\n\f(1993) with a value of Q\u2217D found by Benz & Asphaug\n(1999) for ice. Fig. 1 shows their model and Equation (4). As discussed in Kobayashi & Tanaka\n(2010), most of the laboratory experiments and\nthe hydrodynamic numerical simulations of collisional disruption showed me not to have a discontinuity at \u03c6 = 1 (Housen et al. 1991; Takagi et al.\n1984; Benz & Asphaug 1999). Therefore, Equation (4) includes erosive collisions (\u03c6 < 1) more\naccurately.\n\ndetermined by the gravitational binding energy,\nbeing independent of material properties. The\ncollisional simulation for gravitational aggregates\nyields Cgg \u223c 10 (Stewart & Leinhardt 2009).\n2.3.\n\nOnce a planetary embryo has grown larger than\nthe Moon, it acquires an atmosphere. It helps the\naccretion of planetesimals or fragments onto an\nembryo; small bodies are captured by the atmosphere of the embryo.\nInaba & Ikoma (2003) provided an analytical\nmodel for a density profile of the atmosphere. We\nconsider the atmosphere at a distance Re from\nan embryo center. We assume that Re is much\nsmaller than that at the outer boundary of the atmosphere and that its temperature is much higher\nthan that at the boundary. The atmospheric density \u03c1a is then proportional to Re\u22123 (Mizuno 1980;\nStevenson 1982). Applying the temperature Tneb ,\npressure Pneb , and density \u03c1neb of the nebula in the\ndisk midplane as those at the outer boundary of\natmosphere, the density profile of the atmosphere\naround an embryo with mass M is given by\n\n1\n\nme / (m1+m2)\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\nEnhancement Radius by Atmosphere\n\n10\n\n\u03c6\n\n4\n16\u03c0\u03c3SB GM Tneb\n\u03c1a (Re )\n=\n\u03c1neb\n3\u03baLe Pneb\n\nFig. 1.- The total ejecta mass me produced by\na single collision with m1 and m2 , as a function\nof the dimensionless energy \u03c6 = m1 m2 v 2 /2(m1 +\nm2 )2 Q\u2217D .

The maximum mass\nor \"isolation mass\" is Miso = 2\u03c0a2 (2Miso /3M\u2217 )1/3 b\u0303\u03a3s,0 .\nIt can be expressed as\nMiso\n\n=\n\nb\u0303\n2.8\n10\n\n!3/2\n\na\n\u00d7\n5 AU\n\n!3\n\n!3/2\n\u03a3s,0\n2.7 g cm\u22122\n!\u22121/2\nM\u2217\nM\u2295 , (11)\nM\u2299\n\nwhere M\u2295 is the Earth mass and M\u2299 is the\nsolar mass. The planetary embryo mass approaches the isolation mass if fragmentation is\nignored (Kokubo & Ida 2000, 2002). However, if\nfragmentation is included, the embryo mass can\nreach only about Mars mass for a MMSN disk\n(Kobayashi et al. 2010).\n\nFINAL EMBRYO MASS\nIsolation Mass\n\nPlanetary embryos can grow until they have\naccreted all planetesimals within their feeding\n5\n\n\f3.2.\n\ntime \u03c4 is characterized as (Adachi et al. 1976)\n\nPlanetesimal Accretion\n\nAs shown by Kobayashi et al. (2010), a planetary embryo accretes planetesimals with masses\ncomparable to original ones or fragments resulting\nfrom collisional grinding of planetesimals. In the\nformer case, a final embryo mass is determined by\nthe equilibrium between the accretion of planetesimals and their removal due to collisional grinding. In the latter case, an embryo can grow until fragments are depleted by the gas drag. Following Kobayashi et al. (2010), we want here to\nderive final masses determined by the accretion\nof planetesimals in the case with atmospheric enhancement, while we treat the fragment accretion\nin Section 3.3.\nAt the oligarchic stage, embryos mainly grow\nthrough collisions with planetesimals that dominate the surface density. The growth rate of an\nembryo with mass M is given by\n\n\u03c4=\n\n2m\n,\n\u03c0r2 CD \u03c1nebvk\n\n(13)\n\nwhere the dimensionless gas drag coefficient CD =\n0.5 for km-sized or larger planetesimals. It should\nbe noted that \u03c4 is the stopping time due to gas\ndrag only when the relative velocity u between\ngas and a body is equal to the Keplerian velocity; hence \u03c4 is almost always much shorter\nthan the stopping time for realistic relative velocities. The e-damping rate due to gas drag is\ngiven by de2 /dt = \u2212Cgas e3 /\u03c4 with Cgas = 2.1\n(Inaba et al. 2001). Using nM = (2\u03c0a\u03b4a)\u22121 with\nthe orbital separation of neighboring embryos of\n\u03b4a = 21/3 hM ab\u0303 (Kokubo & Ida 2000) and equating the stirring and damping rates result in the\nequilibrium eccentricity: 1\n#1/5\n\"\nCVS ln(\u039b2 + 1)\u03a9k \u03c4\n\u1ebd =\n.\n(14)\n24/3 \u03c0 b\u0303Cgas\n\ndM\n= Cacc \u03a3s a2 h2M hPcol i\u03a9k ,\n(12)\ndt\nwhere \u03a9K is the Keplerian frequency and Cacc is\nthe correction factor on the order of unity. The\ndimensionless collision rate hPcol i is formulated as\na function of the eccentricities e and inclinations\ni of bodies accreted onto the embryo. We assume\ne = 2i in this analysis.\nEmbryos have a constant ratio of their separations to their Hill radii (Kokubo & Ida 1998).\nWhen the ratio decreases as embryos grow, relatively smaller embryos are culled and thereby remaining embryos keep the ratio constant. Supposing the cull occurs instantaneously, the growth\nrate of embryos due to the cull is estimated to be a\nhalf of that from planetesimals. Therefore, we set\nCacc = 1.5 (e.g., Chambers 2006; Kobayashi et al.\n2010).\nFor kilometer-sized or larger planetesimals,\ntheir eccentricities e are controlled by the embryo stirring and gas drag.\nThe stirring rate\nis written as de2 /dt = nM a2 h4M hPVS i\u03a9k , where\nnM is the surface number density of embryos and\nthe dimensionless stirring rate hPVS i is given by\nhPVS i = CVS h2M ln(\u039b2 + 1)/e2 with CVS = 40 and\n\u039b = 5\u1ebd3 /96 for e \u226b hM (Ohtsuki et al. 2002).\nAlthough ln(\u039b2 + 1) in hPVS i is weakly dependent\non e, we adopt, in this analysis, ln(\u039b2 + 1) \u2243 8,\nwith which value we can reproduce the formula of\nOhtsuki et al. (2002) for \u1ebd = 3\u201310. The gas-drag\n\nSince we roughly estimate \u1ebd \u223c (\u03c4 \u03a9k )1/5 from\nEquation (14), the eccentricities of the kilometersized and larger bodies are larger than hM , according to the assumption e \u226b hM .\nTaking into account the enhancement due\nto the atmosphere,\nthe dimensionless collisional probability for e \u226b hM is given by\n(Greenzweig & Lissauer 1992; Inaba et al. 2001;\nInaba & Ikoma 2003)\nhPcol i =\n\nCcol R\u0303 Re\n,\n\u1ebd2 R\n\n(15)\n\nwhere Ccol = 36 and R\u0303 = R/ahM = (9M\u2217 /4\u03c0\u03c1p )1/3 /a.\nInserting Eqs.

(2003) presented a similar equation from the stirring timescale derived by Ida & Makino (1993). We apply the formula of\nOhtsuki et al. (2002), which weakly depends on e through\nln(\u039b2 + 1). However, since we adopt a constant value for\nln(\u039b2 + 1) in this analysis, there is no substantial difference\nbetween their and our treatment, except for the definition\nof the coefficient for the viscous stirring.\n\n6\n\n\fwhere M0 is the initial embryo mass. Note that\nthe derivation of Equation (21) assumed that the\nplanetesimal density reduction is caused by collisional grinding, but the planetesimal accretion\nonto embryos significantly contributes to the \u03a3s reduction when the surface density of planetesimals, \u03a3s , is much smaller than that of embryos,\nM nM .\nWhen an embryo reaches a final mass\nMca , \u03a3s may be described as C\u03a3s Mca nM with a\nconstant C\u03a3s \u226a 1; hence\n\u00132/3\n\u0012\nMca\n\u03a3s\n= C\u03a3s\n.\n(22)\n\u03a3s,0\nMiso\n\nAs embryos grow, destructive collisions between planetesimals are induced by the stirring\nof embryos and generate a lot of small fragments,\nwhich produce further small bodies through mutual collisions.\nSince very small bodies resulting from successive collisions are rapidly removed by the gas drag, the collision cascade reduces the surface density of solids. In the collision cascade, collisional fragmentation dominates\nthe mass flux along the mass coordinate. Since\nthe mass flux is independent of mass in a steady\nstate, the mass distribution of fragments follows a\npower law and the power-law exponent \u03b1 is given\nby \u03b1 = (11 + 3p)/(6 + 3p) for e2 /Q\u2217D \u221d m\u2212p\n(Kobayashi & Tanaka 2010).

The collision rates between\nthe bodies are calculated from the formulae\nof Inaba et al. (2001).\n\nRegarding the method of numerical simulation,\nwe basically follow Kobayashi et al. (2010). The\nmethod of Kobayashi et al. (2010) is briefly explained here. In the calculation, a disk is divided\ninto concentric annuli and each annulus contains\na set of mass batches. We set the mass ratio\nbetween the adjacent batches to 1.2, which can\nreproduce the collisional growth of bodies resulting from N -body simulation without fragmentation (Kobayashi et al. 2010) and the analytical solution of mass depletion due to collisional grinding\n(Kobayashi & Tanaka 2010). The mass and velocity evolution of bodies and their radial transport\nare calculated as follows.\n\n- The random velocities given by e and i of the\nbodies simultaneously evolve through their\nmutual gravitational interactions, gas drag,\nand collisional damping. The formulae of\nOhtsuki et al. (2002) are applied to describe\nthe changing rates of e and i. The gasdrag damping rates of e and i are described\nas functions of e, i, \u03b7, and \u03c4 according to\nInaba et al. (2001). To determine \u03c4 , we take\ninto account Stokes and Epstein drag as well\nas a drag law with a quadratic dependence\non velocity. For the collisional damping,\nboth fragments and a merger resulting from\na single collision have the velocity dispersion\nat the gravity center of colliding bodies.\n\n- The mass distribution of bodies evolves\nthrough their mutual collisions that produce mergers and fragments. The total mass\nof fragments ejected by a single collision is\n\n10\n\n\f- In each annulus there is a loss and gain\nof bodies due to their inward drift. The\nnumber\nloss rate from an annulus is given\nR\nby (N (m)vdrift /\u2206a)dm, where vdrift is the\ndrift velocity of bodies, N (m)dm is the number of bodies with mass ranging from m\nto m + dm in the annulus, and \u2206a is the\nwidth of the annulus. The bodies lost from\neach annulus are added to the next inner\nannulus. The drift velocity is given by\n(Kobayashi et al. 2010)\n\n\u03a3gas = \u03a3gas,0 exp(\u2212t/Tgas,dep), where Tgas,dep\nis the gas depletion timescale, which we set\nto Tgas,dep = 107 years.

The case with the atmosphere shows a\nsimilar dependence of the final embryo masses\non initial planetesimal mass. However, since the\natmosphere accelerates embryo growth, embryos\nlarger than 10 M\u2295 are produced inside 8\u20139 AU of\na 10\u00d7MMSN disk with 100 km-sized initial planetesimals.\nWhile the final masses of embryos exceed 10M\u2295\nfor large initial planetesimals of r0 & 100 km, embryos must reach the critical core mass within the\ndisk lifetime Tgas,dep to form gas giant planets.\nThe growth timescale is estimated to be M/\u1e40 ,\nwhere \u1e40 is given by Equation (16). The critical distance ac inside which embryos can reach\n10M\u2295 is approximately obtained from the condition M/\u1e40 < Tgas,dep with M = 10M\u2295 ,\n\n7\n\nTime [yr]\nFig. 6.- Evolution of embryo mass at 6.4 AU\nwith m0 = 4.2 \u00d7 1018 g (r0 = 10 km) for\n\u03a30 = 71 g cm\u22122 (10\u00d7MMSN; top), 21 g cm\u22122\n(3\u00d7MMSN; middle), and 7.1 g cm\u22122 (MMSN; bottom). Solid lines show the case with atmosphere\nand dotted lines represent the result without atmosphere.\nThe resulting fragments with low e actively accrete onto embryos. For m0 = 4.2 \u00d7 1015 g\n(r0 = 1 km), embryos can reach a final mass Ma\nin a relatively wide region inside 10 AU (MMSN),\n20 AU (3\u00d7MMSN), and 30 AU (10\u00d7MMSN). On\nthe other hand, large initial planetesimals delay the runaway growth of embryos (Ormel et al.\n2010a,b) and the following oligarchic growth is\nalso slower than that for small planetesimals because embryos mainly accrete original planetesimals rather than fragments with low e. For\nr0 = 100 km, embryos attain the final masses\nonly inside 4 AU for 3\u00d7MMSN and inside 6 AU\nfor 10\u00d7MMSN, and embryos cannot reach final\nmasses beyond 2.7 AU in the MMSN disk.

In addition, we estimate ac \u223c 5 AU\nfrom Equation (40) for a 10\u00d7MMSN disk with\nr0 = 103 km. Indeed, the simulation with \u03a31 =\n71 g cm\u22122 and r0 = 100 km shows embryos cannot\nreach 10M\u2295 beyond 5 AU (see Fig. 8).

The final\nmass Ma with atmosphere is estimated to be larger\nthan 200M\u2295.\n\n5.\n\nWe also give a constraint on f . For f . 0.01, a\nfinal mass is almost independent of f (see Fig. 9).\nThis is because the gas opacity dominates over the\ngrain opacity (see Equation (39)). For f = 1, embryos at 3\u20134 AU become larger due to the capture\nof bodies drifting from outside, while final embryo\nmasses in the outer disk are similar to the case\nwithout atmosphere. The condition of f . 0.01\nis therefore necessary for gas giant formation in\nthe region 5\u201310 AU and such low f is acceptable;\nthe depletion factor f should be much smaller\nthan unity after planetesimal formation. In addition, a low-opacity atmosphere reduces the critical core mass (Mizuno 1980; Ikoma et al. 2000;\nHori & Ikoma 2010).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe derived final embryo masses analytically\nand numerically. They agree with each other quite\nwell in the inner disk where the embryo formation timescale is shorter than the nebula lifetime\n(\u223c 107 years). The analytical formula for final\nmasses Ma implies that initial planetesimal radii\nshould be larger than about 3\u00d7103 km to form embryos with 10 M\u2295 at 5 AU in a MMSN disk. However, the critical distance ac inside which embryos\nreach 10 M\u2295 within 107 years (Equation (40)) is\nestimated to be much smaller than 5 AU; a massive\ndisk is likely to form gas giant planets. Embryos\ninside 5 AU of a \u223c 10\u00d7MMSN disk exceed final\nembryo masses Ma due to the accretion of small\nbodies drifting from outside. In spite of such further growth, embryos starting from small planetes13\n\n\fimals cannot reach the critical core mass \u223c 10 M\u2295 .\nIn addition, further growth is insignificant beyond\n5 AU. The formulae for Ma and ac suggest that\ninitial planetesimals with r0 \u2243 50\u2013700 km are necessary for embryos to reach 10 M\u2295 at 5 AU in the\n10\u00d7MMSN disk.\nInaba et al. (2003) performed similar simulations incorporating collisional fragmentation and\nenhancement due to the embryo's atmosphere\nand showed a planetary core with M > 10M\u2295\ncould be produced around 5 AU with m0 =\n4.2 \u00d7 1018 g (r0 = 10 km) for 10\u00d7MMSN. In\nour simulation, embryos cannot reach 10M\u2295 under this condition and larger planetesimals are\nnecessary to form such massive embryos beyond\n5 AU. As Kobayashi & Tanaka (2010) discussed,\nWilliams & Wetherill (1994) underestimated the\ntotal ejecta mass produced by a single collision for\ncratering; Inaba et al. adopted the fragmentation\nmodel similar to theirs that Wetherill & Stewart\n(1993) developed (see Fig. 1). Erosive collisions\nshorten the depletion time of 10km-sized planetesimals in collision cascade by a factor of 4\u2013\n5 (Kobayashi & Tanaka 2010) and hence reduce\nfinal embryo masses. As seen from Eqs. (24)\nand (36), final embryo masses Mca , Mfa increase with Q\u2217D ; the results of Inaba et al. correspond to embryo masses for higher Q\u2217D . Although we and Inaba et al. applied Q\u2217D provided by Benz & Asphaug (1999), porous bodies\nwith r . 10 km may have much lower Q\u2217D (e.g.,\nStewart & Leinhardt 2009; Machii & Nakamura\n2011). For initial planetesimals with radii &\n100 km, Q\u2217D of slightly larger bodies determines\nfinal embryo masses and is almost entirely determined by the gravitational binding energy; the\nuncertainty from their structure would be minor.\nTherefore, such large planetesimals are possible to\nproduce cores for gas giant planets.\nThe mechanisms of planetesimal formation are\nhighly debated but, despite intensive effort, remain fairly unknown. The formation through collisional coagulation in which dust smoothly grows\nto planetesimals with r0 \u223c 1 km face barriers:\nmeter-sized objects should be lost to the central\nstar as a result of gas drag (Weidenschilling 1977;\nBrauer et al. 2008), and further agglomeration of\ncm-sized objects upon collision is problematic because of collisional bouncing (G\u00fcttler et al. 2010;\nZsom et al. 2010). Moreover, the electric repul-\n\nsion may stop growth of smaller objects (Okuzumi\n2009). A new scenario that allows one to overcome the barriers has been proposed recently: selfgravity of small particles accumulating in turbulent structures of gaseous disks forms large planetesimals of the order of 100 km (Johansen et al.\n2007; Cuzzi et al. 2008). Not only do such large\nplanetesimals produce planetary cores exceeding\nthe critical core mass to form gas giant planets,\nthey may also be consistent with properties of minor bodies in the solar system. Indeed, the initial\nplanetesimals should be larger than 100 km to reproduce the mass distribution of asteroids in the\nmain belt (Morbidelli et al. 2009).\nFor large planetesimals, a final embryo mass\ngiven by Mca is large enough to start core accretion, while embryo growth is slow. If the radial slope of surface density q = 3/2 like the\nMMSN model, a massive disk with 10\u00d7MMSN\nis necessary for embryos to reach the final mass\naround 10 AU. However, observations of protoplanetary disks infer their relatively flatter radial distributions over several hundred AU (e.g.,\nKitamura et al. 2002). In such a disk, dust grains\naccumulate in an inner disk due to radial drift during their growth, which increases the solid surface\ndensity in the inner disk (Brauer et al. 2008). The\nenhancement of solid surface density accelerates\nembryo growth and hence embryos may achieve\nthe critical core mass in less massive disks.\nTo form gas giants via core accretion, rapid\ngas accretion onto a core with \u223c 10 Earth masses\nmust occur prior to gas depletion. However, these\ncores migrate inward due to their exchange of angular momentum with the surrounding gas (Type\nI). From linear analysis, the characteristic orbital\ndecay time of Earth-mass cores at several AU in\nthe MMSN model is about 1 Myr (Tanaka et al.\n2002). Several processes to delay the timescale of\nType I migration have been pointed out, for example, disk surface density transitions (Masset et al.\n2006b), intrinsic turbulence (Nelson & Papaloizou\n2004), and hydrodynamic feedback (Masset et al.\n2006a). There is still uncertainty about this estimate of the migration time. Indeed, the distribution consistent with observations of exoplanets can be reproduced only if the timescale of the\ntype I migration is at least an order of magnitude\nlonger than that derived from the linear analysis\n(Ida & Lin 2008). We should also investigate the\n14\n\n\fstrength of such migration for the survival of cores\nof gas giant planets in our future work.\n6.\n\n4. The embryo growth depends on the disk\nmass, initial planetesimal sizes, and the\nopacity of atmosphere. We have performed\nstatistical simulations to calculate the final\nembryo masses over a broad range of parameters. We took the surface density of solids\nat 1 AU in the range of \u03a31 = 7.1\u201371g cm\u22122\n(1\u201310\u00d7MMSN), initial planetesimal radius\nr0 = 1\u20131000 km, and the grain depletion\nfactor f in planetary atmosphere between\nf = 10\u22124 \u20131. We found that planetary embryos can exceed 10M\u2295 within 8-9 AU for\n10\u00d7MMSN, r0 = 100 km, and f \u2264 0.01.\nOther sets of parameters cannot produce\nmassive cores at 5\u201310 AU. For example, embryo's mass can reach 6 M\u2295 for r0 = 10 km\nonly inside 4 AU. Therefore, we conclude\nthat a massive disk (\u223c 10\u00d7MMSN) with\nr0 \u223c 100 km and f . 0.01 is necessary to\nform gas giant planets around 5\u201310 AU. This\ncondition for large embryo formation is independent of the material strength and/or\nstructure of bodies, because Q\u2217D of 100kmsized or larger bodies is largely determined\nby their self-gravity.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn this paper, we investigate the growth of planetary embryos by taking into account, among others, two effects that are of major importance. One\nof them is collisional fragmentation of planetesimals, which is induced by their gravitational interaction with planetary cores. Another effect is an\nenhancement of collisional cross section of a growing embryo by a tenuous atmosphere of nebular\ngas, which becomes substantial when an embryo\nhas reached about a Mars mass.\nThe main results are summarized as follows.\n1. If the atmosphere is not taken into account,\ncollisional fragmentation suppresses planetary embryo growth substantially. As a result, embryos cannot reach the critical core\nmass of \u223c 10M\u2295 needed to trigger rapid\ngas accretion to form gas giants. The final masses are about Mars mass in a MMSN\ndisk (Kobayashi et al. 2010). Embryo's atmosphere accelerates the embryo growth and\nmay increase the final embryo mass by up to\na factor of ten.\n2. Planetary embryos attain their final masses\nasymptotically. We have derived the final\nmass analytically. The final mass of an embryo is predicted to be the larger of Mca and\nMfa , which are given by Eqs. (24) and (36),\nrespectively. These final masses are in good\nagreement with the results of statistical simulations.\n\nWe thank Chris Ormel for helpful discussions\nand the reviewer, John Chambers, for useful comments on the manuscript.\nREFERENCES\nAdachi, I., Hayashi, C., & Nakazawa, K. 1976,\nProgress of Theoretical Physics, 56, 1756\n\n3. Our solution indicates that an initial planetesimal radius r0 & 3 \u00d7 103 km is necessary\nto form a planetary core with 10 M\u2295 at 5 AU\nin a MMSN disk. However, such initially\nlarge planetesimals delay embryo growth; a\nmassive disk is required to produce massive\ncores within a disk lifetime. The analytical\nsolution for the final mass and the embryo\nformation time show that planetesimals with\nan initial radius of r0 \u2243 50\u2013700 km are likely\nto produce such a large planetary core within\na disk lifetime at 5 AU for 10\u00d7MMSN.\n\nBenz, W., & Asphaug, E. 1999, Icarus, 142, 5\nBodenheimer, P., & Pollack, J.
