The basic idea is that while\ngeneric field theories involving scalars are unstable to large radiative corrections which mix scales, these radiative effects can be made much smaller\nif the scalar theory is embedded inside some supersymmetric theory. The\ndynamical breaking of supersymmetry through non-perturbative effects can\nthen occur at scales which are exponentially suppressed relative to the grand\nunified scale. This symmetry breaking can, in turn, then trigger electroweak\nbreaking.\nThus the non-perturbative structure of supersymmetric theories is a subject of great interest. The only tool for a systematic investigation of nonperturbative effects is the lattice and so a lot of effort has gone into formulating lattice supersymmetric theories [2]. Typically it is difficult to write\ndown lattice actions which can be shown to flow to a supersymmetric fixed\npoint, without fine tuning, as the lattice spacing is reduced.\nThe model we examine in this paper \u2013 the two dimensional Wess-Zumino\nmodel appears to provide an exception to this rule. This theory involves the\ninteractions of scalars and fermion fields and exhibits an N = 1 supersymmetry in the continuum. A version of this model defined on complex fields\nand possessing N = 2 supersymmetry was the subject of a recent numerical\nstudy in [3] and was also examined in a variety of earlier papers [4]. The\nN = 2 model actually possesses an exact lattice supersymmetry which can\nbe seen to result from its proximity to a continuum topological field theory\n[5].\nWe have chosen to study a particular Euclidean lattice formulation of\nthe N = 1 model due to Golterman and Petcher [1]. The model has also\nbeen studied using a Hamiltonian formulation in [6] and [7]. Unlike the\nHamiltonian formulations, the Euclidean lattice theory does not retain any\nexact supersymmetry. Nevertheless, Golterman et al. prove that the discrete\nanalog of the continuum supersymmetric Ward identities are satisfied exactly\nin the limit of vanishing lattice spacing without the necessity of additional\nfine tuning. The proof is perturbative and our goal in these simulations was\nto check whether the model allows for supersymmetry breaking via nonperturbative effects. We find that indeed the lattice model shows evidence\nof supersymmetry breaking for small values of the lattice mass parameter.\nFurthermore, this breaking is correlated to the onset of field configurations\n2\n\n\fwhich sample both the classical vacua of the model. In this limit we also\nobserve a light fermion state which we speculate may play the role of a\nGoldstino associated with spontaneous supersymmetry breaking.\nWe have developed and tested a fourier accelerated version of the socalled R-algorithm [8] to handle the fermionic integrations. For details of\nthis Fourier acceleration technique in the context of the HMC algorithm we\nrefer the reader to [9]. We have employed an exact algorithm to calculate\nthe sign of the Pfaffian resulting from the integration over the fermion fields.\nThese issues are discussed in detail in section 2. We present our evidence\nfor symmetry breaking together with numerical results on the spectrum and\nWard identities in section 3. In section 4 we summarize our findings and\ndiscuss their implications for supersymmetry breaking in the continuum in\nfinite and infinite volume.\n\n3\n\n\f2\n\nLattice model\n\nWe consider the on-shell two-dimensional Wess-Zumino model represented\nby the following continuum action in Euclidean space [1]:\nS0 =\n\nZ\n\nd2 x\n\n1\n[(\u2202\u03bc \u03c6)2 + \u03c8\u0304(\u2202/ + P \u2032 (\u03c6))\u03c8 + P 2 (\u03c6)]\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c6 and \u03c8 are a real scalar field and a two component Majorana spinor\nrespectively. The construction of Euclidean Majorana spinors is described\nby Nicolai in [10]. The expression Q(\u03c6) = \u2202/ + P \u2032 (\u03c6) will be referred to as\nthe fermion matrix. The potential P (\u03c6) we consider (actually the derivative\nof the superpotential) takes the following form depending on a mass M and\na coupling constant G:\nP (\u03c6) =\n\n(\n\nM\u03c6\nG\u03c62 \u2212 M 2 /4G\n\n, G=0\n, G=\n6 0\n\nNotice that this potential is slightly different from the one considered in [1]\nbut may be derived from it by a simple shift in the scalar field. It has the\nadvantage that the total action now only depends on M 2 which allows us\nto restrict our simulations to positive M . Notice also that the interacting\ntheory has two classical vacua at \u03c6 = \u00b1M/2G. The action (1) is invariant\nunder the following supersymmetry transformation:\n\u03b4\u03c6 = \u03b5\u0304\u03c8,\n\n\u03b4\u03c8 = (\u2202/\u03c6 \u2212 P (\u03c6))\u03b5\n\nThe simplest supersymmetric Ward identity following from this invariance\ntakes the form\n< \u03c8x \u03c8\u0304y > + < [\u2202/\u03c6 \u2212 P (\u03c6)]x \u03c6y >= 0\n\n(2)\n\nIntegrating out fermion variables in the path integral leads to the following form of the partition function [11] (see the Pfaffian definition (9) in\nappendix):\nZ=\n\nZ\n\n\u2212S0\n\nD\u03c6D\u03c8e\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nD\u03c6 Sign[Pf(CQ)] etr[ln(Q\n\nT Q)]/4\u2212S\n\nb\n\nwhere C is a Euclidean representation of the charge conjugation matrix and\nSb stands for the bosonic part of the action:\nSb =\n\nZ\n\nd2 x\n\n1\n[(\u2202\u03bc \u03c6)2 + P 2 (\u03c6)]\n2\n4\n\n\fIn practice we simulate the system without regard to the sign of the Pfaffian\nusing the following action S\n1\nS = \u2212 tr[ln(QT Q)] +\n4\n\nZ\n\nd2 x\n\n1\n[(\u2202\u03bc \u03c6)2 + P 2 (\u03c6)]\n2\n\n(3)\n\nThe expectation values of physical observables are then obtained by reweighting with the measured sign of the Pfaffian in the usual manner\n< O > S0 =\n\n< O Sign[Pf(CQ)] >S\n< Sign[Pf(CQ)] >S\n\n(4)\n\nWe now turn to the lattice model. First, we replace the continuum\n\u03bc\nderivative operator by the symmetric difference matrix Drr\n\u2032 where the latter\nis defined as:\n1\n\u03bc\nDrr\n[\u03b4r+e\u03bc ,r\u2032 \u2212 \u03b4r\u2212e\u03bc ,r\u2032 ]\n\u2032 =\n2\nwhere r, r\u2032 are two-dimensional vectors enumerating the lattice sites and\ne\u03bc is a unit vector in the \u03bc-direction \u03bc = 1, 2. In terms of this difference\noperator the fermion matrix on the lattice can be represented as:\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u2032\nQ \u2261 Q\u03b1\u03b2\nrr\u2032 = \u03b3\u03b1\u03b2 Drr\u2032 + \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 Prr\u2032\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2 are spinor indices. We have employed the following representations of the Dirac matrices\n\u03b31 =\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n-1\n\n!\n\n0\n-1\n\n\u03b32 =\n\n-1\n0\n\n!\n\nThe matrix C is given explicitly as\nC=\n\n0\n1\n\n-1\n0\n\n!\n\nIt is convenient to define an operator \u2737nrr\u2032 :\n\u2737nrr\u2032 =\n\n1X\n[\u03b4r+ne\u03bc ,r\u2032 + \u03b4r\u2212ne\u03bc ,r\u2032 \u2212 2\u03b4r,r\u2032 ]\n2 \u03bc\n\nIn particular\n\u27372rr\u2032 = (D \u03bc D \u03bc )rr\u2032\nIn terms of the operator \u2737nrr\u2032 the lattice potential and its derivative can be\nrepresented as follows:\nPr =\n\n(\n\nm\u03c6r \u2212 \u27371rr\u2032 \u03c6r\u2032 /2\ng\u03c62r \u2212 m2 /4g \u2212 \u27371rr\u2032 \u03c6r\u2032 /2\n5\n\n, g=0\n, g=\n6 0\n\n\f\u2032\nPrr\n\u2032\n\n\u2202Pr\n\u2261\n=\n\u2202\u03c6r\u2032\n\n(\n\nm\u03b4rr\u2032 \u2212 \u27371rr\u2032 /2\n2g\u03c6r \u03b4rr\u2032 \u2212 \u27371rr\u2032 /2\n\n, g=0\n, g=\n6 0\n\nwhere the term with \u27371rr\u2032 is the Wilson mass operator, which serves to\neliminate problems due to doubling of the lattice fermion modes and vanishes\nin the continuum limit. The dimensionless lattice couplings g and m are\nrelated to their continuum counterparts through the relations g = Ga and\nm = M a with a the lattice spacing.\nFinally the lattice representation of the continuum action (3) can be\nviewed as the sum of the following boson and fermion components:\nSb =\n\n1\n{\u2212\u03c6r \u27372rr\u2032 \u03c6r\u2032 + Pr Pr }\n2\n\n1\n1\nSf = \u2212 tr[ln(QT Q)] \u2261 \u2212 [ln(QT Q)]\u03b1\u03b1\nrr\n4\n4\n\n6\n\n\f3\n\nSimulation Details\n\nTo simulate the system (3) we use an importance sampling technique based\non a classical evolution of the fields in some auxiliary time. To implement\nthis it is necessary to introduce a Hamiltonian\n1\nH = pr pr + S\n2\nassociated with this auxiliary time variable t and corresponding momentum\nfield p conjugate to the field \u03c6. On integration over the auxiliary momentum\np it is trivial to show that the classical partition function associated to\nH reproduces the quantum partition function associated with the original\naction S. The advantage of this Hamiltonian formulation is that it admits a\nclassical dynamics, which can be used to generate global moves of the field\n\u03c6.\nWe evolve the system governed by H according to a finite time step\nleapfrog algorithm in the usual manner\n\u03c6t+\u03b4t = \u03c6t + pt \u03b4t + Ft (\u03b4t)2 /2\npt+\u03b4t = pt + (Ft + Ft+\u03b4t )\u03b4t/2\nwhere F is the force associated with the classical evolution. The ergodicity\nof the simulation is provided by periodically drawing new momenta p from\na Gaussian distribution. In order to decrease the autocorrelation time associated with this dynamics we have utilized acceleration techniques similar\nto those explored in [9]. Specifically, the discrete time update of the fields\ncorresponding to the Hamiltonian evolution is carried out in momentum\nspace with a momentum dependent time step which is tuned so as to evolve\nlow momentum components of the field more rapidly than high momentum\ncomponents. Specifically we used a time step of the form\n\u03b4t(n) = \u01eb r\n\nmacc + 4\n\nP2\n\n\u03bc=1 sin\n\n2 2\u03c0n\u03bc\nL\n\n\u0010\n\n+ macc + 2\n\nP2\n\n\u03bc=1 sin\n\n\u00112\n2 \u03c0n\u03bc\nL\n\nwhere the lattice momenta n are integer vectors with components ranging\nfrom 0 \u2192 L \u2212 1 for an L \u00d7 L lattice. The parameter macc is typically set to\nthe input lattice mass which is close to optimal in these simulations.\nThe total force can be represented as a sum of boson and fermion contributions:\nFr = Frb + Frf\n7\n\n\fThe evaluation of the boson force is straightforward:\nFrb = \u2212\n\n\u2202Sb\n= \u27372rr\u2032 \u03c6r\u2032 \u2212 Pr\u2032 Pr\u2032\u2032 r\n\u2202br\n\nIn order to evaluate the fermion force we first evaluate the following expression involving the fermion matrix:\n\u2202(QT Q)\u03b1\u03b2\n\u2202 2 Ps\u2032 \u03b1\u03b2\n\u2202 2 Ps\u2032\n\u03b2\u03b1\nrr\u2032\n= 2g(\u03b4rs Q\u03b1\u03b2\n=\nQs\u2032 r\u2032 + Q\u03b2\u03b1\n\u2032r\nrr\u2032 + Qr\u2032 r \u03b4r\u2032 s )\ns\n\u2202bs\n\u2202br \u2202bs\n\u2202br\u2032 \u2202bs\nThe fermion force then is:\nFsf = \u2212\n\n\u2202(QT Q)\u03b2\u03b1\n\u2202Sf\n1\n\u03b1\u03b2\nr\u2032 r\n= [(QT Q)\u22121 ]\u03b1\u03b2\n= g[(QT Q)\u22121 ]\u03b1\u03b2\nsr Qsr\nrr\u2032\n\u2202bs\n4\n\u2202bs\n\nThe computation of the fermion force appears to be problematic as it\nappears to require the repeated inversion of the fermion matrix which is\nprohibitively expensive. In order to resolve this problem we use the so-called\nR-algorithm [8]. The algorithm proceeds by replacing the exact inverse\nmatrix (QT Q)\u22121 by a stochastic estimator given by the following expression\n\u03b1 \u03b2\n[(QT Q)\u22121 ]\u03b1\u03b2\nrr\u2032 \u2248< Xr Xr\u2032 >N\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the vector X is defined through a random Gaussian vector Rg as:\nQX = Rg\nand the averaging in (5) is accomplished over N different random noise\nvectors Rg .\nThe larger the number of noise vectors used N the more accurate is the\nevaluation of the inverted matrix in (5), but the longer computational time\nthe evaluation takes. It is clear that the optimal value of N is given by that\nwhich minimizes the error in the inverse matrix for fixed computational time\nT . Defining the norm of a matrix kAk as\nkAk =\n\nsX\n\nA2ij\n\nij\n\nThe relative error is then\n\u03b4kAk\n=\nkAk\n\ns\n\nN\nT\n8\n\n\u001a\n\n\u03b4kAk\nkAk\n\n\u001b\n\nN\n\n\fwhere {\u03b4kAk/kAk}N is the relative error produced by a single application\nof an R-algorithm with averaging over N noise vectors. Hence the relative\nerror obtained over time T can be characterized by the algorithm efficiency\nE which we define as\n\u221a \u001a \u03b4kAk \u001b\nE= N\nkAk N\n\nOur tests showed that this algorithm efficiency does not depend strongly on\nthe choice of N (Figure 1). Furthermore, we monitored the average bosonic\naction < Sb > and observed no systematic drift with N . Consequently we\nchose N = 1 in all our runs. In this limit the corresponding fermion force\nterm yields\nFsf \u2248\n\n\u03b2\u03b1\ng\n1 \u03b1 \u03b2 \u2202(QT Q)r\u2032 r\nXr Xr\u2032\n(Xs\u03b1 Xr\u03b2 + Xs\u03b2 Xr\u03b1 )\n= Q\u03b1\u03b2\n4\n\u2202bs\n2 sr\n\nFinally let us turn to the issue of the sign of the Pfaffian which results\nfrom integrating out the Majorana fields. As we have stressed the simulation action discussed above utilizes the absolute value of this Pfaffian and\nobservables must be re-weighted by the sign of the Pfaffian in order to compute physical expectation values. We have chosen to use an exact algorithm\nto compute this sign. Since we are in two dimensions and need only do\nthis when making measurements this turns out to be quite manageable in\na practical sense. Our procedure was outlined in [12] and for completeness\nwe list the proof and details of the algorithm in an appendix. In essence the\noriginal antisymmetric matrix can be transformed to a special block diagonal form via a similarity transformation built from a triangular matrix. The\ndeterminant of the latter can be shown to yield the Pfaffian. We then fold\nthe sign of the Pfaffian in with measurements of observables according to\n(4). This reweighting procedure is an effective way to measure expectation\nvalues of a variety of observables. However, in certain conditions this technique may fail. The following arguments highlight the problems that may\nbe encountered in this type of situation.\nLet N+ and N\u2212 be the numbers of configurations with positive and\nnegative values of Pf(CQ) obtained from the simulation of the system (3).\nThen the average value < O >S0 of any physical observable O in the system\n(1) can be evaluated using (4) as:\n< O >=\n\nO+ N+ \u2212 O\u2212 N\u2212\nN+ \u2212 N\u2212\n\n(6)\n\nwhere O\u00b1 are average values of O obtained in configurations subsets with\npositive and negative Pf(CQ). This averaging procedure reveals two statis9\n\n\ftical problems. The first problem is that if N+ \u2248 N\u2212 (that is the probabilities to find the system with either sign of the Pfaffian are approximately\nthe same) then the error of the evaluation (6) experiences an amplification\nby a large factor (N+ + N\u2212 )/(N+ \u2212 N\u2212 ). In this case it is possible for the\nerror to swamp the signal in the measured value < O >. Although acquiring more measurements will decrease the fluctuations it might not solve the\namplification problem if\nN+\n\u223c1\nN+ +N\u2212 \u2192\u221e N\u2212\nlim\n\n(7)\n\nA second problem is that the expression (6) provides a good evaluation\nof < O >S0 only if < O > is uniquely defined in the limit N+ + N\u2212 \u2192 \u221e,\nwhich is not necessarily the case. If (7) takes place then < O > is well\ndefined only if < O+ >=< O\u2212 >, which is not guaranteed to be true.\nIn practice we find that many of our observables suffer large and difficult\nto quantify errors for small values of the lattice mass where we observe oscillations in the sign of the Pfaffian. This precludes making strong quantitative\nstatements in that region.\n\n10\n\n\f4\n\nResults\n\nWe obtained data for lattice sizes L = 8 and L = 16 for a fixed lattice coupling g = 0.125 while varying the lattice bare mass m. The classical vacua\nof the lattice theory correspond to vanishing fermion field and boson field\n\u03c6 = \u00b1m/2g. For large m, field configurations which interpolate between\nthese two vacua are associated with large values of the action and are hence\nexpected to be highly suppressed. We thus expect the boson field to be confined in the neighborhood of one of the classical vacua for sufficiently large\nmass. In the continuum the action is invariant under \u03c6 \u2192 \u2212\u03c6 implying that\nthese two vacuum states are equivalent. This is no longer true on the lattice\ndue to the presence of the Wilson term (actually the sign of the Pfaffian\nmay also change under this symmetry). Indeed our simulations reveal that\nonly the state with < \u03c6 >\u223c \u2212m/2g survives at large m. As m decreases\nwe expect that tunneling to the other vacuum state may occur and this is\nindeed seen in our simulations. Figures 2 and 3 show plots of < Pf(CQ) >\nand < \u03c6 > /m versus m for L = 8, 16. Below some critical m = mc (L) the\nsign of the Pfaffian which is negative at large mass m starts to fluctuate.\nAdditionally, in this region we can see that the average field < \u03c6 > /m also\nundergoes large fluctuations which are the direct result of the Pfaffian sign\nchanges. Indeed, at small mass we observe that for each configuration in\nour ensemble the sign of the Pfaffian is very accurately correlated with the\nsign of the mean boson field. Figure 4 shows a time series of both quantities\nat m = 0.125 and L = 8 which illustrates very well this behavior. Actually\nit is easy to see why this is so. Imagine expanding the Pfaffian as a power\nseries in the boson field \u03c6. For sufficiently small m we expect that only the\nleading term is important and by translational symmetry this can depend\nonly on the field summed over all lattice sites.\nPf(CQ) \u223c\n\nX\n\n\u03c6r + O\n\nX\n\n\u2032\n\nrr\u2032\n\nr\n\n\u03c6r \u03c6r\u2032\n\n!\n\nAs we discussed in the previous section this sign oscillation renders accurate\nmeasurements of < \u03c6 > and its error very difficult in this region.\nWe have also measured the (zero momentum) boson and fermion correlation functions over the same range of lattice bare masses. Figures 5\nand 6 show typical bosonic and fermionic two point functions computed on\nensembles corresponding to L = 16 with m = 0.5. These are fitted by hyperbolic cosh and mixed hyperbolic sinh and cosh functions to extract the\ncorresponding boson and fermion masses. These (lattice) masses are shown\n11\n\n\fN+\n40968\n43814\n52252\n\nN\u2212\n59032\n56186\n47748\n\nTable 1: Numbers of positive and negative Pfaffians for L = 8 and m = 0.25\n\nin figures 7 and 8 for L = 8 and L = 16 respectively. The statistical errors\nwe show neglect the effects of correlation between observables at different\ntimeslices. Consider the data for L = 8. Notice that the boson and fermion\nmasses are equal within statistical errors at large bare input mass but deviate substantially at small mass - the diagonal spinor components of the\nfermion correlator being dominated by a light state. Contrast this will the\noff-diagonal components of the fermion correlator for small bare mass which\nyield a much heavier mass degenerate with the boson mass within statistical\nerrors. A light fermion state is also visible in the L = 16 data at small mass.\nThe mass of this light fermionic state appears to decrease with the bare\ninput lattice mass m. It is tempting to conclude from these observations\nthat for small enough mass supersymmetry breaks as a result of mixing between the two classical vacua \u2013 this being signaled by the appearance of a\nGoldstino.\nAnother line of evidence in favor of this derives from the partition function itself. On a finite lattice equipped with periodic boundary conditions,\nsuch as employed in our simulations, the partition function can be thought\nof as yielding a representation of the Witten index. Vanishing Witten index\nis a necessary condition for supersymmetry breaking. But Z can also be\nrelated to the expectation value of the sign of the Pfaffian in our simulation\nensemble\nZS0 =< Sign (Pf(CQ)) >S\nThus we see that a vanishing partition function would require equal numbers\nof positive and negative sign Pfaffians in our ensemble. Table 1. shows the\nnumbers of positive N+ and negative N\u2212 Pfaffians for three different runs\nat the same parameter values L = 8 and m = 0.25 each containing 100, 000\nmeasurements. While the relative errors of on the order of ten percent it\nshould be clear that the data are consistent with a vanishing Witten index\nimplying a non-zero vacuum energy.\nTo investigate this symmetry breaking further we have looked at the\nsimplest supersymmetric Ward identity involving two point functions (2).\n12\n\n\fFigures 9 to 12 show the bosonic and fermionic diagonal and off-diagonal\nspinor contributions to this Ward identity together with their sum for two\ndifferent values of the bare mass m = 0.125 and m = 0.5 on a lattice with\nL = 16. Clearly for large mass this relation is satisfied within errors for\nall spinor channels but it is clearly violated at small mass for the channel\ninvolving the diagonal spinor correlations. The latter channel is precisely the\none in which the light fermion was seen and support the idea that breaking\nof supersymmetry is associated with the appearance of a Goldstino. Notice\nthat the off-diagonal components of the Ward identity are still accurately\nsatisfied even at small mass. We will argue in the next section that this\nis exactly what we might expect for a partial breaking of supersymmetry\nassociated with the appearance of a finite volume vacuum state composed\nof solitons.\n\n13\n\n\f5\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have studied a lattice regularized version of the two-dimensional Wess\nZumino model which possesses N = 1 supersymmetry in the naive continuum limit. This model was first analyzed in [1] where it was shown perturbatively that the supersymmetric Ward identities are recovered without\nfinite tuning in the limit of vanishing lattice spacing. The goal of our simulations was to check these conclusions at the non-perturbative level and to\nspecifically to address the important issue of supersymmetry breaking. We\nhave considered the model for fixed lattice coupling g = 0.125 and varying\nlattice mass m for two lattice sizes L = 8 and L = 16. For large m our\nresults favor a supersymmetric phase in which boson states pair with equal\nmass fermion states and the supersymmetric Ward identities are satisfied.\nIn this region of parameter space corresponding to \u03c6 \u223c \u2212m/2g the boson\nfield suffers small fluctuations around a single vacuum state.\nAs the mass is lowered however this picture changes and below some critical mass mc (L) we see configurations in which the mean boson field varies\nin sign corresponding to tunneling between different vacua in auxiliary time.\nThe appearance of states which interpolate between different perturbative\nvacua is of course entirely a non-perturbative effect. Associated with these\ntunneling states we see oscillations in the Pfaffian of the fermion operator\nand the appearance of a light fermion visible in the diagonal components of\nthe fermion correlator. In such a phase it appears that supersymmetry is at\nleast partially broken.\nIt is possible to get some further understanding of this phenomenon\nwithin the context of the semi-classical approximation. Consider first the\ncontinuum model. It is clear that in a finite volume corresponding to a box\nof size Lphys , in addition to the supersymmetric vacua \u03c6 = \u00b1M/2G, there\nare additional local minima of the action (1) corresponding to domain wall\nsolutions which interpolate between these vacua.\n\u03c6(x) \u2192 \u039b, x \u2192 \u221e\n\n\u03c6(x) \u2192 \u2212\u039b, x \u2192 \u2212\u221e\n\nwhere \u039b = M/2G and x corresponds to one of the coordinate directions.\nIndeed, in the continuum, these solutions take the form\n\u03c6(x) = \u039b tanh(M (x \u2212 x0 )/2)\nWhile the mass of such a soliton state is non-zero it is possible to show\nthat it is nevertheless annihilated by a single component of the Majorana\n14\n\n\fsupercharge and hence such a state preserves one half of the original supersymmetry [13]. This is the origin of our observation that certain components\nof the Ward identities appear to be satisfied at all values of the parameters.\nThe action of such a soliton is easily evaluated SDW = 43 GLphys \u039b3 and being proportional to the integral of a total derivative term is topological in\ncharacter. The corresponding free energy associated with such domain wall\nsolutions then varies as\nFDW \u223c \u2212 ln Lphys + SDW\nwhere the logarithmic variation with volume arises from the number of ways\nthe domain wall can be introduced into the finite volume. These arguments\nlead one to conclude that these non-supersymmetric vacua will dominate\nover the supersymmetric vacua if\nM3\nSDW\n=\n<\nLphys\n6G2\n\nln Lphys\nLphys\n\n!\n\n(8)\n\nAt fixed G this result is in qualitative agreement with our lattice results since\nit predicts a critical mass MC (Lphys ) below which supersymmetry would be\nbroken. Translating this result naively into lattice variables leads to the\nprediction that mC \u223c 0.3 for L = 8 and g = 0.125 which is quite close to the\ncontinuum estimate MC a = 0.46 for Lphys = 8a. According to our observations this critical mass shifts to smaller values as the lattice size increases\nwhich is also in agreement with these analytic arguments. Furthermore, in\nthe vicinity of such a domain wall the fermion is approximately massless and\nso can play the role of a Goldstino associated with supersymmetry breaking.\nNotice that these arguments rely on the constraint of finite volume. The action of such a soliton is unbounded in infinite volume and hence we would\nnaively expect solitons to be completely suppressed in such a limit.\nOf course we would like to know whether this finite volume supersymmetry breaking scenario persists in the continuum limit. In general, in finite\nphysical volume V = L2phy , the continuum limit a = 1/Lphy \u2192 0 should be\napproached by fixing (in this case) two renormalized physical parameters\nwhich may be taken as the mass MR Lphy and coupling constant GR Lphy expressed in units of the physical length Lphy . Perturbation theory allows\nus to relate these renormalized dimensionless quantities to their bare lattice\ncounterparts\nGR Lphy \u223c gL,\n\nMR2 L2phy \u223c m2 L2 \u2212 Cg2 L2 ln (\u03bca)\n15\n\n\fwhere \u03bc is the mass scale associated to the renormalization point and C is\nm\na numerical constant. Along such an RG trajectory the value \u03bb = 2g\ncan\nthen be related to its constant (continuum) value \u039bR via the relation\n\u0012 \u0013\u0013 1\n\n1\nC\n\u039bR \u223c \u03bb 1 \u2212 2 ln\n\u03bb\nL\n\u0012\n\n2\n\nFor small enough L < Lc the log term on the right is small and \u03bb \u223c \u039bR . If\nthis is the case the soliton action SDW \u223c gL\u03bb3 is approximately constant and\nthe corresponding free energy of such configurations negative for any value of\nthe bare parameters. This would correspond to finite volume supersymmetry\nbreaking. Conversely for large enough L the log term will dominate and lead\nto an infinite soliton action as L \u2192 \u221e for any value of the bare parameters.\nIn this limit the solitons should disappear and supersymmetry should be\nrestored. The cross-over between these two behaviors occurs for\n2\n\nL \u223c Lc = Ae\u2212\u03bb\n\nThese conclusions are in agreement with the reasoning presented in [14].\nWhile this work was in preparation we received a preprint [15] in which\nthe same model is studied in a Hamiltonian framework. The conclusions of\nthis study are broadly in agreement with ours.\n\n16\n\n\fAppendix: the algorithm for determining the Pfaffian of an antisymmetric matrix.\nIn this chapter we describe the algorithm for determining the Pfaffian of an\narbitrary antisymmetric 2N by 2N matrix M , which is defined as follows:\nPfM =\n\n1\n\u03b5\u03b11 ,\u03b21 ,...,\u03b1N ,\u03b2N M\u03b11 ,\u03b21 . . .

If P is a matrix such that an antisymmetric matrix M can be represented as M = P T JP where J = diag(i\u03b33 , i\u03b33 , ..., i\u03b33 ) is a block-diagonal\nmatrix then PfM = det P (here C = i\u03b33 is the Euclidean representation of\nthe charge conjugation matrix for two-dimensional system).\nThe theorem can be proved using the representation of Pfaffian in terms\nof an integral over a Grassmann 2N-vector \u03b8.

P2N \u22121,\u03b1N P2N,\u03b2N = det P\nNotice that the matrix P is not orthogonal (P T 6= P \u22121 ), hence it is not\nassociated with any basis transformation in 2N -dimensional vector space.\nThe above theorem can be given an alternative formulation. Defining\nQ = P \u22121 leads to the following statement: if QT M Q = J then PfM =\n(det Q)\u22121 . This formulation is used in the algorithm we describe below.\nThe purpose of the algorithm is to represent a given antisymmetric matrix\nM in terms of a triangular matrix Q so that the det Q and hence the PfM\ncan be found easily.\nThe algorithm task. Given an arbitrary antisymmetric 2N by 2N matrix M\nfind a triangular matrix Q such that QT M Q = J, J = diag(i\u03b33 , i\u03b33 , ..., i\u03b33 ).\n\n17\n\n\fThe triangular matrix Q = {qi } represented in terms of its columns qi\nwill satisfy the relation above iff its columns satisfy the following conditions:\n(q2i\u22121 M q2j\u22121 ) = 0,\n\n(q2i M q2j ) = 0\n\n(q2i M q2j\u22121 ) = \u2212(q2j\u22121 M q2i ) = \u03b4ij\nThe following algorithm by construction leads to such a matrix Q.\nThe algorithm.\n1.
