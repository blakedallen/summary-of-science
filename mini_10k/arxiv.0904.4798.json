Dino Buzzati (San\n\u2217\n\nI am very grateful to my longlasting friend Eng. Giorgio Borghini.\n\n1\n\n\fPellegrino 1906\u2013 Milano 1972) was an italian journalist, a writer, a poet and\na painter. He had been an extraordinary explorer of the human mind, of his\nanguish and fears, and his writings perfectly reflect his deep vision of the\nhuman condition. I already had the pleasure to read something by Buzzati\nand to go into his troubled and fascinating Weltanschauung, but the first\ntale of this collection, titled 'I sette messaggeri' (The seven messengers)\nstrongly impressed my 'mathematical imagination': just more than thirty\nyears old, a Prince decides to explore the Father's Kingdom and aims to\nreach its furthermost boundaries. He starts from the City with a Caravan and\nseven fast and strong Knights. These Knights have the task to maintain the\ncommunications between the Caravan and the City during the exploration,\nin other words they are the Messengers. The first Messenger starts two days\nafter the departure of the Caravan, the second three days after and so on.\nMany years pass and the Kingdom seems to be endless. Even though the\nMessengers ride night and day, every day, their encounters with the Caravan\nbecome ever more rare and the contacts between the Caravan and the City\nabsurdly far away in time.\nSoon after having read the tale I tried to derive the time elapsed, for each\nMessenger, between each tour using the informations given by the author\nand, to my amazement, I obtained really the same values described in the\ntale. My wonder was mainly due to the fact that, by my experience, this\nparticular attention to mathematical accuracy is a bit unusual in this kind\nof literture.\nIn the following Section I derive the mathematical expression of the duration of the tours. Let me refer to this relation as to the \"Buzzati sequence\",\nnamed after the great writer. Suggested by the fascinating atmosphere of\nthe tale, where men seem to be lost in time, in the third Section I make the\nexercise of extending the previous formula to cases in which the velocities of\nthe Caravan and Messengers are relativistic (namely, closer to the velocity\nof light).\n\n2\n\nBuzzati sequence\n\nBefore deriving the \"Buzzati sequence\" it is appropriate to clarify all the\napproximations introduced with the aim of simplifying the derivation. I\nassume that all the velocities are constant in modulus (Vc is the velocity of\n2\n\n\fthe Caravan, while Vm is the velocity of all Messengers. Obviously it must be\nVm > Vc , otherwise the Caravan misses the Messengers) and that Messengers\nchange direction instantaneously soon after having reached the City or the\nCaravan (in other words they never stop). With Tn,i I represent the time\nwhen the i\u2013th Messenger leaves the Caravan for the n\u2013th tour (for sake of\nsimplicity time counting starts when the Caravan leaves the City) and \u2206Tn,i\nis the duration of the n\u2013th tour (i.e. \u2206Tn,i = Tn+1,i \u2212 Tn,i ).\nWith this assumptions it is not difficult to see that for first tours the\nfollowing relation holds\nVm \u2206T1,i = 2Vc T1,i + Vc \u2206T1,i ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhich simply states that the distance covered by the i\u2013th Messenger in his\nfirst tour must be equal to two times the distance covered by the Caravan\njust before this departure plus the distance covered by the Caravan during\nMessenger's travel. So from equation (1) we have for \u2206T1,i\nVc\n2Vc T1,i\n= 2qT1,i , if we define q \u2261\n.\n(2)\nVm \u2212 Vc\nVm \u2212 Vc\nThe general expression for \u2206Tn,i can be easily obtained from equation\n(2) by substituting T1,i with the time when the n\u2013th departure takes place.\nProceeding by steps\n\u2206T1,i =\n\n\u2206T2,i = 2q(T1,i + \u2206T1,i ) = \u2206T1,i + 2q\u2206T1,i = \u2206T1,i (1 + 2q),\nsince the i\u2013th Messenger starts his second tour at T2,i = T1,i + \u2206T1,i ,\n\u2206T3,i = 2q(T1,i + \u2206T1,i + \u2206T2,i ) = \u2206T2,i + 2q\u2206T2,i = \u2206T2,i (1 + 2q) = \u2206T1,i (1 + 2q)2 ,\n\u2206T4,i = 2q(T1,i + \u2206T1,i + \u2206T2,i + \u2206T3,1 ) = \u2206T3,i + 2q\u2206T3,i = \u2206T3,i (1 + 2q) =\n= \u2206T1,i (1 + 2q)3 ,\n....,\nand so on. So we can write by induction\n\u2206Tn,i = \u2206T1,i (1 + 2q)n\u22121 = 2qT1,i (1 + 2q)n\u22121.\n3\n\n(3)\n\n\fMoreover comparing equation (2) with equation (3) it is easy to see that\nthe time Tn,i when the n\u2013th departure takes place is simply\nTn,i = T1,i (1 + 2q)n\u22121 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhich is a straightforward geometric progression.\nIf we adopt the relation Vm = 3/2Vc (so q = 2) and we put T1,i =\n(i + 1)days, i = 1, ..., 7, like in the tale by Buzzati, we can verify how fast (4)\ngrows with n. In the following table some values of Tn,i are shown\nq=2\nT1,i\nT2,i\nT3,i\nT4,i\nT5,i\nT6,i\nT7,i\n\n3\n\nMess. 1\n2 days\n10 \"\n50 \"\n250 \"\n\u223c 3.4 yrs\n\u223c 17.1 \"\n\u223c 85.6 \"\n\nMess. 2\n3 days\n15 \"\n75 \"\n375 \"\n\u223c 5.1 yrs\n\u223c 25.7 \"\n\u223c 128.4 \"\n\nMess. 3\n4 days\n20 \"\n100 \"\n\u223c 1.4 yrs\n\u223c 6.8 \"\n\u223c 34.2 \"\n\u223c 171.2 \"\n\nMess. 4\n5 days\n25 \"\n125 \"\n\u223c 1.7 yrs\n\u223c 8.6 \"\n\u223c 42.8 \"\n\u223c 214.0 \"\n\nMess. 5\n6 days\n30 \"\n150 \"\n\u223c 2.05 yrs\n\u223c 10.3 \"\n\u223c 51.4 \"\n\u223c 256.8 \"\n\nMess. 6\n7 days\n35 \"\n175 \"\n\u223c 2.4 yrs\n\u223c 12.0 \"\n\u223c 60.0 \"\n\u223c 299.6 \"\n\nRelativistic treatment\n\nIt is appropriate to note that the way in which relations (3) and (4) have been\nderived in the previous section doesn't take differences between 'reference\nsystems' into account, i.e. the time Tn,i is the same for the City, the Caravan\nand the i\u2013th Messenger; moreover (3) and (4) seem to hold for every absolute\nvalue of Vm and Vc .\nHowever, form the Theory of Special Relativity (TSR, A. Einstein, 1905)\nit is well known that nothing can overcome the speed of light and that the\nmeasure of space and time intervals depends on the particular reference system.\nHere we are dealing with special relativity so time and space intervals\nwill be measured with respect to inertial reference systems, that is, systems\nin which free motion of bodies (motion not subject to any kind of external\nforce) is a constant speed motion.\nAccording to the theory what is really invariant is the infinitesimal 'length'\nelement in space\u2013time\nds2 = c2 dt2 \u2212 dx2 \u2212 dy 2 \u2212 dz 2 ,\n4\n\n(5)\n\nMess. 7\n8 days\n40 \"\n200 \"\n\u223c 2.7 yrs\n\u223c 13.7 \"\n\u223c 68.5 \"\n\u223c 342.5 \"\n\n\fnamely, the 'distance' between two events infinitesimally close in space and\ntime. Indeed, in any inertial reference system we can assign a time and three\nspatial coordinates (t, x, y, z) to any event and (5) can be written for two\nevents infinitesimally close; the main point is that the value of ds2 is the\nsame for all those systems. So, for two inertial reference systems, say O and\nO, the following holds\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nc2 dt2 \u2212 dx2 \u2212 dy 2 \u2212 dz 2 = c2 dt \u2212 dx \u2212 dy \u2212 dz ,\n\n(6)\n\nno matter what is the constant relative velocity between O and O.\nFrom (6) it is not difficult to obtain the expression for the 'proper time'\nof an observer, i.e. the time measured by a clock at rest in the observer\nreference system (for example, like we will see, the proper time of the Caravan\nor Messengers). In our inertial system (O) the infinitesimal displacement of\nthe observer in space\u2013time is of the form of (5), while in the reference system\nof the observer (O), by definition, there is no spatial displacement and (5)\nbecomes\n2\n2\nds = c2 dt .\n2\n\nBut now we know that ds2 = ds , so\n2\n\nc2 dt = c2 dt2 \u2212 dx2 \u2212 dy 2 \u2212 dz 2 .\n\n(7)\n\n\u2192\n\nMoreover if v (t) is the observer velocity (not necessarily uniform) that\nwe measure in our inertial system, we can write, for infinitesimal spatial\ndisplacements,\ndx = vx (t)dt,\n\ndy = vy (t)dt,\n\ndz = vz (t)dt,\n\nso, for proper time t, we have (from (7))\nt=\n\nZt\n0\n\ndt =\n\nv\nZt u\nu\nt\n0\n\n\u2192\n\n\u2192\n\nv (\u03c4 )* v (\u03c4 )\nd\u03c4.\n1\u2212\nc2\n\n(8)\n\nFor a more detailed description of these basic principles and a more rigorous derivation of the formulas you can see, for example, the book by L. D.\nLandau and E. M. Lif\u0161its, The Classical Theory of Fields [2].\n\n5\n\n\fNow we are able to deal with the extension of 'Buzzati sequence' to cases\nin which Vc /c \u2192 1, Vm /c \u2192 1, where c is the speed of light; I will use the\nsame notations and approximations of Section 2.\nSuppose you live in the City (our inertial reference system) and you want\nto find out the proper time of the Caravan and Messengers, then all you need\nis (3), (4) and (8). It is natural to consider T1,i like a time measured in the\nreference frame of the Caravan (in fact before their first tours the Messengers\nbelong to the Caravan), while in the City we have, by (8)\ns\n\nT1,i =\n\n1\u2212\n\nVc2\nT1,i,City\nc2\n\n\u2192\n\n1\nT1,i,City = q\n1\u2212\n\nVc2\nc2\n\nT1,i .\n\n(9)\n\nObviously I suppose that all the clocks have been synchronized at the\norigin. So for Tn,i,City , which gives the time of the n\u2013th departure in the\nreference system of the City, we have\n1\nTn,i,City = T1,i,City (1 + 2q)n\u22121 = q\n1\u2212\n\nVc2\nc2\n\nT1,i (1 + 2q)n\u22121.\n\n(10)\n\nq\n\nMultiplying (10) by 1 \u2212 Vc2 /c2 we will obtain the proper time Tn,i of\nthe Caravan which is obviously T1,i (1 + 2q)n\u22121 again. Concerning the proper\ntime of Messengers the situation is quite different. The proper time Tn,i,Mes\nwhen Messengers start their n\u2013th tour, is the sum of the following two terms\n(see (8) again)\nTn,i,Mes =\n\ns\nT1,i,City\nZ\n0\n\nV2\n1 \u2212 c2 d\u03c4\nc\n\n+\n\ns\nTn,i,City\nZ\n\n1\u2212\n\nT1,i,City\n\nVm2\nd\u03c4,\nc2\n\n(11)\n\nsince before T1,i,City the Caravan and the Messengers travel together at the\nsame speed Vc . The integration (11) is trivial and using equations (9) and\n(10) we obtain\nq\n\n1\u2212\n\nTn,i,Mes = q\n1\u2212\n\n2\nVm\nc2\nVc2\nc2\n\nT1,i (1 + 2q)n\u22121\n\n+\n\n\uf8eb\n\nq\n\n1\u2212\n\n\uf8ed1 \u2212 q\n\n1\u2212\n\n2\nVm\nc2\nVc2\nc2\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8 T1,i .\n\n(12)\n\nNow it is easy to verify that both (10) and (12) reduce themselves to (4)\nwhen Vc /c \u2192 0 and Vm /c \u2192 0. Moreover the time Tn,i,Mes is asymptotically\n6\n\n\flower than both proper time of the Caravan and Tn,i,City (this phenomenon\nis of the same kind of the so\u2013called 'Twin Paradox').\nA little more difficult exercise is to derive the expression of proper time\nCity\nof Messengers when they reach the City during their n\u2013th tour (Tn,i,Mes\n) . In\nthe reference system of the City the i\u2013th Messenger starts his n\u2013th tour at\nTn,i,City , when the Caravan is at distance Tn,i,City \u00d7 Vc , so he will reach the\nCity after Tn,i,City \u00d7 Vc /Vm or Tn,i,City \u00d7 q/(1 + q) (see (2)). Thus the proper\ntime will be, using (8) again,\nCity\nTn,i,Mes\n\n= Tn,i,Mes\n\ns\n\n+\n\n1\u2212\n\nVm2 q\nTn,i,City ,\nc2 1 + q\n\nwhich becomes, substituting Tn,i,City and Tn,i,Mes with (10) and (12),\nCity\nTn,i,Mes\n\nq\n\n1\u2212\n\n= q\n\n1\u2212\n\n2\nVm\nc2\nVc2\nc2\n\n!\n\nq\nT1,i (1+2q)n\u22121\n1+\n1+q\n\n+\n\n\uf8eb\n\nq\n\n1\u2212\n\n\uf8ed1 \u2212 q\n\n1\u2212\n\n2\nVm\nc2\nVc2\nc2\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8 T1,i .\n\n(13)\n\nCity\nTn,4,Mes\n\nIn the following table some values of Tn,4,City , Tn,4,Mes , Tn,4 and\nfor Messenger 4 are shown; q is still equal to 2 and for Vc I have chosen a\ntest value of c/2 (so Vm = 3/4c)\nn\n\nTn,4,City\n\nTn,4,Mes\n\nTn,4 (non relativistic)\n\nCity\nTn,4,Mes\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n5.8 days\n28.9 \"\n144.3 \"\n\u223c 1.9 yrs\n\u223c 9.9 \"\n\u223c 49.4 \"\n\u223c 247.1 \"\n\n5 days\n20.3 \"\n96.6 \"\n\u223c 1.3 yrs\n\u223c 6.5 \"\n\u223c 32.7 \"\n\u223c 163.5 \"\n\n5 days\n25 \"\n125 \"\n\u223c 1.7 yrs\n\u223c 8.6 \"\n\u223c 42.8 \"\n\u223c 214.0 \"\n\n7.54 days\n33.0 \"\n160.3 \"\n\u223c 2.2 yrs\n\u223c 10.9 \"\n\u223c 54.5 \"\n\u223c 272.5 \"\n\nLastly suppose that the Caravan uses electromagnetic waves to communicate, namely Vm = c. Hence, it is easy to see that, at first order in Vc /c, equation (10) becomes Tn,i,City = Tn,i = T1,i (1 + 2(n \u2212 1)Vc /c) (remember that the\nexchange of informations between Caravan and Messengers \u2013electromagnetic\nMessengers too\u2013 was supposed instantaneous).\nAnd the last thought, why not to see Buzzati's marvelous tale as a\nmetaphor for the future space exploration of the mankind?\n7\n\n\fReferences\n[1] Dino Buzzati, La Boutique del Mistero, Arnoldo Mondadori Editore, Milano, 1968 (in Italian).\n[2] L.
