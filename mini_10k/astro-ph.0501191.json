With the exception of 40 Eri B\n(4 kG) these are the first positive detections of magnetic fields in white dwarfs\nbelow 30 kG. A detection rate of 25 % (3/12) may indicate now for the first time\nthat a substantial fraction of white dwarfs have a weak magnetic field. This\nresult, if confirmed by future observations, would form a cornerstone for our\nunderstanding of the evolution of stellar magnetic fields.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nOn the main sequence and at later stages of evolution, magnetic fields have a\nmajor impact on the angular momentum loss and stellar winds, on building-up\nchemical anomalies and abundance inhomogeneities across the stellar surface,\non convection and the related coronal activity, and other evolutionary processes\nespecially in interacting binaries. The first detection of a magnetic field on a\nwhite dwarf (WD) was made by Kemp et al. (1970) on Grw+70\u25e6 8247, and\nlarge spectroscopic and polarimetric surveys have been carried out since then\n(e.g. Schmidt & Smith 1995). The magnetic fields of WDs could simply be \"fossil\" remnants of the fields already present in main-sequence stars, but strongly\namplified by contraction. This hypothesis assumes that the magnetic flux (e.g.\nthrough the magnetic equator) is conserved to a large extent during the stellar\nevolution.\nIn main-sequence stars magnetic fields have been detected directly mainly\nfor peculiar magnetic Ap and Bp stars with rather well organized fields and field\nstrengths \u223c 102 \u2212 104 G. For weak fields in A to O stars (B < 102 G) direct\nmagnetic field detections are still very rare. For sun-like stars ample evidence\n(coronal activity) for the presence of complicated small-scale fields exists, but\ndirect measurements are only possible for the more active stars (e.g. Saar 1996;\nR\u00fcedi et al. 1997). The contraction to a WD amplifies the magnetic fields by\n1\n\n\f2\n\nAznar Cuadrado et al.\n\nabout 4 orders of magnitude, so that weak and often undetectable magnetic\nfields on the main sequence become measurable during the WD phase. This is\nsupported by the known magnetic WDs with Megagauss fields (B = 106 \u2212109 G).\nTheir frequency and spatial distribution, as well as their mass, are consistent\nwith the widely accepted view that they are the descendents of the magnetic Ap\nand Bp stars (e.g. Mathys 2001). Magnetic main-sequence stars with weaker\nmagnetic fields have been suggested as possible progenitor candidates for the\nmagnetic degenerates with weaker fields (e.g. Schmidt et al. 2003). The B stars\non which weaker fields have been detected may be the missing stars. However,\neven the most sensitive observations are limited to some tens of Gauss on mainsequence stars.\nThus, magnetic field amplification during stellar evolution may offer the\nopportunity to investigate \u223c 1 G magnetic fields (averaged global fields) in\nnormal main-sequence stars with observations of \u223c 1 kG magnetic fields during\nthe WD stage. Zeeman splitting of narrow NLTE line cores in the Balmer lines\nbecomes undetectable in intensity spectra for weak fields (< 20 kG) or for objects\nwithout narrow line core. Therefore, spectropolarimetry is the most promising\ntechnique for successful detections of weak magnetic fields.\nIt is interesting to note that, recently, magnetic fields have also been detected in the direct progeny of white dwarfs, subdwarfs and central stars of\nplanetary nebulae (O'Toole et al. and Jordan et al., these proceedings).\n2.\n\nObservations and Data Reduction\n\nSpectropolarimetric observations of a sample of 12 normal DA WDs were carried out during the period 4 November 2002 \u2013 3 March 2003, in service mode\nby ESO staff members using FORS1 at the VLT. With a 0.8\u2032\u2032 wide slit we obtained a (FWHM) spectral resolution of 4.5 \u00c5. The data were recorded using a\nTek. 2048\u00d72048 CCD with 24 \u03bcm pixels which correspond to a pixel scale of\n0.2\u2032\u2032 /pixel in spatial and 1 \u00c5/pixel in spectral direction. Spectra were acquired\nwith grism G600B (spectral range 3400\u20136000 \u00c5), covering all H i Balmer lines\nfrom H\u03b2 to the Balmer jump simultaneously.\nOur 12 targets were selected with the criterion of not having any sign of\nZeeman splitting visible in the SPY-UVES spectra (Napiwotzki et al. 2003), and\nhence no magnetic fields above a level of about 20 kG. All our targets have strong\nhydrogen lines, ideal for measuring line polarisation, and no bright companion.\nMost of our targets were observed at least over two nights.\nIn all frames the bias level was subtracted and the frames were cleaned of\ncosmic ray hits. The frames were then flat-field corrected and the wavelength\ncalibration was applied.\n3.\n\nCircular Polarisation\n\nIn order to obtain circular polarisation spectra a Wollaston prism and a quarterwave plate were inserted into the optical path. Each exposure yields two spectra\non the detector, one from the extra-ordinary beam and the other from the ordinary beam. Stokes V is obtained from a differential measurement of photon\n\n\fKilo-gauss magnetic fields in three DA white dwarfs\n\n3\n\ncounts in either the ordinary or extra-ordinary beams, measured at two different\nangles of the retarder waveplate. We adopted the FORS1 standard observing\nsequence for circular polarimetry consisting of exposures with retarder plate\nposition angles +45\u25e6 and \u221245\u25e6 .\nIn order to derive the circular polarisation from a sequence of exposures, we\nadded up the exposures with the same quarter-wave plate position angle. The\nStokes (V /I) can be obtained as\nV\n(R \u2212 1)\n=\n,\nI\n(R + 1)\n\nwith R2 =\n\n\u0012\n\nfo\nfe\n\n\u0013\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u03b1=+45\n\n\u0012\n\nfe\nfo\n\n\u0013\n\n(1)\n\n\u03b1=\u221245\n\nwhere V is the Stokes parameter which describes the net circular polarisation, I\nis the unpolarized intensity, \u03b1 indicates the nominal value of the position angle\nof the retarder waveplate, and fo and fe are the fluxes on the detector from the\nordinary and extra-ordinary beams of the Wollaston, respectively.\n4.\n\nDetermination of Weak Magnetic Fields\n\nFor field strengths below 10 kG the Zeeman splitting of the Balmer lines is less\nthan 0.1 \u00c5. This is well below the width of the cores of the Balmer lines in all the\nstars of our sample (typically a few \u00c5). Therefore, we can apply the weak-field\napproximation (e.g., Landi degl'Innocenti & Landi degl'Innocenti 1973) without\nany loss of accuracy. According to this approximation the measured V and I\nprofiles are related to hBz i by the expression:\n\nV\n1 \u2202I\n= \u2212geff Cz \u03bb2\nhBz i ,\nI\nI \u2202\u03bb\n\n(2)\n\nwhere geff is the effective Land\u00e9 factor (= 1 for all hydrogen lines of any series,\nCasini & Landi degl'Innocenti 1994), \u03bb is the wavelength expressed in \u00c5, hBz i\nis the mean longitudinal component of the magnetic field expressed in Gauss\nand the constant Cz = e/(4\u03c0me c2 ) (\u2243 4.67 \u00d7 10\u221213 G\u22121 \u00c5\u22121 ). Note that this\napproximation also holds if instrumental broadening is present, but it is not\ngenerally correct if the profiles are rotationally broadened (Landstreet 1982).\nThe error associated with the determination of the longitudinal field obtained from individual Balmer lines is larger for Balmer lines at shorter wavelengths than for lines at longer wavelengths. This is due to the combination of\ntwo effects: while the Zeeman effect increases as lambda squared, most other\nline broadening effects depend linearly on lambda, so that the magnetic field\nis better detected at longer wavelengths than at shorter wavelengths; furthermore, the Balmer lines at shorter wavelengths are less deep, so that \u2202I/\u2202\u03bb is\nsmaller. Using H\u03b2 and H\u03b3 simultaneously, we obtained a determination of the\nmean longitudinal magnetic field that best fit the observed (V /I).\nFor stars observed during more than one night the circular polarisation spectra (V /I) flux weighted means were calculated. The averaging helps to extract\nsignal hidden in the noise of the individual exposures if the stellar Zeeman signal\nremains unchanged with time. In two of the averaged spectra (corresponding\nto WD 0446\u2212789, see Fig. 1, and WD 2359\u2212434) a moderate S-shape circular\n\n\f4\n\nAznar Cuadrado et al.\n\nFigure 1.

The horizontal dashed lines indicate the position\nof the 1\u03c3 level of the average (V /I) spectrum. The light shading represents\nthe variation between (V /I) spectra predicted by the low-field approximation\n(Eq. 2) using B values of 4283\u00b1640 G (thick solid line).\n\npolarisation signature across H\u03b2 and H\u03b3 can be noticed. For WD 1105\u2212048 polarisation reversals of those lines were only present in one of the two observing\nnights. This may indicate a different orientation of the magnetic field between\nthe two epochs due to stellar rotation.\nTo determine the longitudinal component of the magnetic field for each\nmeasurement we compared the observed circular polarisation for an interval of\n\u00b120 \u00c5 around H\u03b2 and H\u03b3 with the prediction of Eq. 2. The best fit for hBz i, the\nonly free parameter, was found by a \u03c72 -minimisation procedure. If we assume\nthat no magnetic field is present, all deviations from zero polarization are due\nto noise. This can be expressed by the standard deviation \u03c3 over the respective\nintervals around the Balmer lines. In Table 1 the best fits for Bz derived from\nthe analysis of H\u03b2 and H\u03b3 lines are shown. We find a significant magnetic field\nin WD 2359\u2212434, WD 0446\u2212789 (see Fig. 1) and WD 1105\u2212048. For the first\ntwo stars the magnetic field is detected at the 3\u03c3 level individually from H\u03b2\nand H\u03b3, as well as from the combination of both lines. Higher members of the\nBalmer series do not contain enough V -signal to give reliable results, but the\nanalysis of H\u03b4 confirms our positive detections of magnetic fields.\n\n5.\n\nAtmospheric and Stellar Parameters\n\nMasses and cooling ages of WDs are of special interest to distinguish between\nthe proposed formation scenarios. These quantities can be computed from the\nfundamental stellar parameters temperature and gravity, which can be derived\nby a model atmosphere analysis of the spectra, and theoretical cooling tracks.\n\n\fKilo-gauss magnetic fields in three DA white dwarfs\n\n5\n\nTable 1.

Radial velocity offsets are corrected by\nshifting the spectra to a common wavelength scale. The synthetic spectra are\nconvolved to the resolution of the observed spectra (4.5 \u00c5) with a Gaussian and\ninterpolated to the actual parameters. The atmospheric parameters are then determined by minimising the \u03c72 value by means of a Levenberg-Marquardt steepest descent algorithm. This procedure is applied simultaneously to all Balmer\nlines of one observed spectrum. Errors are estimated to be 2.3% in Teff and\n0.07 dex in log g (Napiwotzki et al. 1999).\nThe parameters listed in Table 1 are the averages of the fit results for the\nindividual spectra. WD masses were computed from a comparison of parameters\nderived from the fit with the grid of WD cooling sequences of Benvenuto &\nAlthaus (1999) for an envelope hydrogen mass of 10\u22124 MWD . Spectroscopic\ndistances d(spec) are determined from the absolute magnitudes computed for\nthe given stellar parameters using the synthetic V band fluxes computed by\nBergeron et al. (1995) and the V magnitudes of the stars. The agreement\nbetween our results and values collected from the literature is generally good.\n6.\n\nDiscussion and Conclusions\n\nThree of the stars out of 12 normal DA WDs of our sample, WD 0446-789,\nWD 1105-048 and WD 2359-434, exhibit magnetic fields of a few kilogauss in\none or all available observations. The detection rate of 25 % suggests strongly\nthat a substantial fraction of WDs have a weak magnetic field.\nWith the exception of the bright WD 40 Eri B, for which a magnetic field\nof only 4 kG had been detected (Fabrika et al. 2003), our three detections have\nthe weakest magnetic fields discovered so far in white dwarfs. Our investigation\nis based on the averaged longitudinal component of the magnetic field, meaning\nthat the maximum magnetic field at the WD surface can be stronger, depending\non the field geometry and on the orientation relative to the observer. Therefore,\nour results for the three objects with a positive detection are lower limits, since\ncancellation effects are expected.\nLiebert et al. (2003) have found that the incidence of magnetism at the\nlevel of \u223c 2 MG or greater is at least \u223c10%, or higher. They suggest that the\n\n\f6\n\nAznar Cuadrado et al.\n\ntotal fraction of magnetic WDs may be substantially higher than 10% due to the\nlimited spectropolarimetric analyses capable of detecting lower field strengths\ndown to \u223c 10 kG. Our 3 detections out of 12 objects seem to indicate that low\nmagnetic fields on WDs (<10 kG) are frequent while high magnetic fields are\nrelatively rare. However, with only three detections this hypothesis remains\ninsecure. If confirmed by future observations, the investigation of weak magnetic fields in WDs could form a cornerstone for the future investigation of the\nproperties and evolution of stellar magnetic fields.\nOur sample of WDs is too small to discuss in detail the dependence of\nthe magnetic field strength on the stellar parameters (masses and cooling ages).\nHowever, two of our detections (WD 0446\u2212789 and WD 1105\u2212048) have masses\nof 0.5 M\u2299 . This means that their progenitors on the main-sequence had less\nthan 1 M\u2299 (Weidemann 2000). These two stars are therefore very different from\nthe majority of WDs with MG magnetic fields which tend to have higher masses\n(Greenstein & Oke 1982; Liebert 1988) and, therefore, high-mass parent stars.\nAt our signal-to-noise ratio, magnetic fields down to about 2 kG can be\nmeasured. There is still the possibility that all magnetic WDs contain surface\nmagnetic fields at the 1 kG level. To test this hypothesis, much longer exposure\ntimes would be necessary, even with the VLT. Full details of our analysis can be\nfound in Aznar Cuadrado et al. (2004).\nReferences\nAznar Cuadrado, R., Jordan, S., Napiwotzki, R., Schmid, H. M., Solanki, S.
