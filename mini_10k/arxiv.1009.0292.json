This was recognized early on by Regge and Wheeler over 50 years\nago [1]. Zerilli then completed the formulation of the\nfirst order perturbations around a Schwarzschild BH in\n1970 [2]. Three years later, Teukolsky [3] provided a new\nformalism to study perturbations around Kerr BHs. In\norder to take into account the decay of the orbit of the\nsmall BH due to the emission of gravitational radiation,\nsecond order effects have to be included in those computations. This problem turned out to be very challenging,\nand only since 1996 [4, 5] has there been a consistent formalism for the \"self-force\" corrections to the background\ngeodesic motion of a small BH orbiting around a larger\none. The explicit implementation of such formalism into\na computational scheme remains challenging, although\nrecent progress along this line is encouraging [6].\nThe dramatic breakthroughs in the numerical techniques to evolve BHBs [7\u20139] transformed the field of Numerical Relativity (NR) and we are now in a position\nto evolve binary systems in the intermediate mass ratio\nregime. Two years ago the merger of spinning [10] binaries with mass ratio q = m1 /m2 = 1/8 and nonspinning\nbinaries[11] with q = 1/10 were published. More recently,\ndetailed long term evolutions of BHBs with q = 1/10\nand q = 1/15 were studied and validated against perturbation theory [12, 13]. In this Letter we present the\nfirst fully nonlinear numerical simulations of the merger\nof small-mass-ratio BHBs. As a case study, we evolve a\nnonspinning BHB with mass ratio q = 1/100 for over two\norbits prior to merger, and resolve the entire waveform\nfor three grid resolutions, proving numerical convergence\nof the results. The success of our approach is based on\nenhancements of the moving puncture numerical techniques that adapt the gauge and grid structure to the\n\nTABLE I: Initial data parameters. The punctures are located\non the x-axis at positions x1 and x2 , with puncture mass\nparameters (not horizons masses) m1 and m2 , and momentum\n\u00b1~\np. The punctures have zero spin.

This has important consequences for astrophysics and gravitational wave observatories such as\nthe second-generation Advanced LIGO detector, thirdgeneration ground-based detectors, and LISA. Supermassive BH collision at cosmological scales are most likely to\noccur in the mass ratio range 1:10 - 1:100 [14] and will be\nobservable by LISA, while collision of intermediate mass\nBHs and solar mass BHs will lie in the sensitivity band of\nsecond and third generation ground-based detectors [15\u2013\n17].\nFully Nonlinear Numerical Simulations: In Table I we\ngive the initial data parameters for our q = 1/100\nBHB simulations. We evolved this BHB data set using the LazEv [18] implementation of the moving puncture approach [8, 9]. Our code used the Cactus/Einstein\ntoolkit [19, 20] and the Carpet [21] mesh refinement\ndriver to provide a 'moving boxes' style mesh refinement.\nWe use AHFinderDirect [22] to locate apparent horizons. We measure the magnitude of the horizon spin\nusing the Isolated Horizon algorithm detailed in [23].\nWe obtain accurate, convergent waveforms and horizon\nparameters by evolving this system in conjunction with a\nmodified 1+log lapse and a modified Gamma-driver shift\ncondition [8, 24], and an initial lapse \u03b1(t = 0) = 2/(1 +\n\n\f2\n4\n\u03c8BL\n). The lapse and shift are evolved with (\u2202t \u2212\u03b2 i \u2202i )\u03b1 =\n\u22122\u03b1K, \u2202t \u03b2 a = 43 \u0393\u0303a \u2212 \u03b7(xk , t) \u03b2 a , where different functional dependences for \u03b7(xk , t) have been proposed in\n[18, 25\u201329]. Here we use a modification of the form prop\nb\nposed in [26], \u03b7(xk , t) = R0 \u03b3\u0303 ij \u2202i W \u2202j W /((1 \u2212 W a ) ),\nwhere we chose R0 = 1.31 and W is the evolved conformal factor. The above gauge condition is inspired\nby, but differs from Ref. [26] between the BHs and in\nthe outer zones when a 6= 1 and b 6= 2. Once the\nconformal\nfactor settles down to its asymptotic \u03c8 =\n\u221a\nC/ r + O(1) form near the puncture, \u03b7 will have the\nform \u03b7 = (R0 /C 2 )(1 + b(r/C 2 )a ) near the puncture and\n\u03b7 = R0 rb\u22122 M/(aM )b as r \u2192 \u221e. Our exploration of\nthe (a, b) parameters showed that the (1,2) case leads\nto numerical instabilities on coarse grids, while the (2,1)\nand (1,1) cases lead to noisy waveforms and slower gauge\nspeeds. In practice we used a = 2 and b = 2, which\nreduces \u03b7 by a factor of 4 at infinity when compared to\nthe original version of this gauge proposed by [26]. We\nnote that if we set b = 1 then \u03b7 will have a 1/r falloff at\nr = \u221e as suggested by [28].\nIn order to chose the width of the refinement levels closest to the small BH, we examine the potentials for perturbations about a nonspinning BH. The idea is that we need\nto model the curvature and the gravitational radiation\nemitted by the small BH (which drives the merger, and\nhence the physics). At the zeros of the derivative of the\npotentials, the variations are minimized. Furthermore\nthe separations between zeros increases, naturally leading to a choice of small-width, high resolution grids between the first zeros, one step lower in resolution between\nthe second two, followed by a sequence of coarser grids.\nAccording to Chandrasekhar [30, p160] the even/odd (\u00b1)\nparity effective potentials of a Schwarzschild BH can be\nwritten as\n\nV`\u00b1 = \u00b16M\n\ndf\n+ (6M )2 f 2 + 4\u03bb(\u03bb + 1) f,\ndr\u2217\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\nf=\n\n(r \u2212 2M )\n,\n+ 3M )\n\n2r2 (\u03bbr\n\n\u03bb=\n\n1\n(` + 2)(` \u2212 1).\n2\n\n(2)\n\nNote that both potentials are numerically very close to\neach other, hence we consider the vanishing of the derivative of the average of the two (in isotropic coordinates R)\nwhen constructing the grid. For ` = 2 and M = 1 this\ntakes the explicit form\nd(V + + V \u2212 )\ndR\n\u2212384\n\n=\n\n(3)\n\n`=2,M =1\n\nR (2 R \u2212 1) 16 R4 \u2212 4 R3 \u2212 60 R2 \u2212 R + 1\n9\n\n(2 R + 1) (4 R2 + 10 R + 1)\n\n3\n\n\u0001\n\u00d7\n\n\u0001\n64R6 + 288R5 + 480R4 + 256R3 + 120R2 + 18R + 1 .\nIdeally, we would like to place the AMR boundaries\naround the small BH near the zeros of this function\n\n(R/m = 0.0, 0.1207998431, 0.5, 2.069539112) The location of the zeros for ` > 2 changes little from the above\nfigures. Since we do not want to over-resolve the interior, this suggests that the first grid level should cover\nthe whole small hole up to its horizon, and the next grid\nlevel up to 4 times the initial horizon radius of the small\nhole in the initial quasi-isotropic coordinates.\nIn Ref. [13] we provide an alternative method of extrapolation of waveforms based on a perturbative propagation of the asymptotic form of \u03c84 at large distances,\nleading to the following simple expression\nlim [r \u03c84`m (r, t)] =\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ t\ndt \u03c84`m (r, t)\nr \u03c84`m (r, t) \u2212 \u03bb\nr\u2192\u221e\n\n0\n\n(4)\n\u22122\n+ O(rObs\n),\n\nr=rObs\n\nwhere rObs is the approximate areal radius of the sphere.\nThis formula is applicable for rObs >\n\u223c 100M . And note\nthat it is also important to remove the low frequency\ncomponents [31] in \u03c84 (since it is inside an integral).\nResults and Analysis: Our simulation used 15 levels of refinement (around the smaller components), with central\nresolutions as high as M/7078, and 9 levels of refinement\naround the larger component. The outer boundaries were\nlocated at 400M and the resolution in the boundary zone\nwas h = 2.3148M for our finest resolution run. The BHB\nperforms \u223c 2 orbits prior to merger [as seen by the formation of a common apparent horizon (CAH)], which\noccurs roughly 160M after the start of the simulation.\nIn terms of computational expense, a medium resolution\nrun requires 500,000 SU and approximately one month\nof runtime. In order to reduce the total runtime, we used\nan aggressive choice of CFL (dt = 1/2h), which leads to\nsignificant BH mass loss when compared to dt = 1/4h.\nTable II shows the results of evolution. We note that\nthe smaller BH mass is conserved to within 0.23% during the inspiral and plunge phases, while the mass of\nthe larger BH is conserved to within 0.003%. In Fig. 1\nwe show the xy projection of the orbital trajectories for\nthe two highest resolution runs. From the figure we can\nsee that the initial jump in the orbit pushes the binary\nslightly outside the ISCO, leading to an additional orbit.\nIn Fig. 2 we show the orbital radius as a function of time\nand resolution. Note that the orbital radius superconverges at low resolution and converges quadratically at\nhigh resolution ( this quadratic error may be due to time\nprolongation effects, as well as effects due to an aggressive choice of CFL factor). In Fig. 3 we show amplitude,\nas well as phase convergence, of the (` = 2, m = 2) mode\nof \u03c84 . The reduced order of convergence is due to an\naggressive choice of CFL factor.\nThe apparent superconvergence in the trajectories and\nwaveforms when considering the three coarsest resolutions is indicative that the lowest resolution is just entering the convergence regime.

We have\nachieved this within the moving punctures approach by\nadapting the gamma-driver shift condition with a variable damping term. Also crucial for evolutions is an optimal choice of the mesh refinement structure around the\nsmall BH. We used the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli potentials\nto guide the setting up of the initial grids. This helps\noptimizing the large resources required to evolve small\nq binaries. The numerical convergence of the waveforms\ndisplayed here, and the successful comparisons with perturbative results [12, 13], show this approach is validated\nin the intermediate mass ratio regime, and can be applied\nto even smaller q's (and larger initial separations into the\npost-Newtonian regime).\nThe feasibility of simulating extreme mass ratios by\npurely fully nonlinear numerical methods, as demonstrated in this work, allows us to look more optimistically\nat the task of generating a bank of templates for second\nand third generation ground-based detectors and LISA.\nMethods like those described in [12, 13], that combine NR\nand perturbative techniques can be used to speed up the\ngeneration of those templates. And finally we now also\nhave a direct way of validating self-force computations\n[6].\nThe techniques presented here would appear to apply\nin a straightforward manner to even smaller mass ratios\nq and to initially spinning BHs. Fine tuning of the quasicircular orbital parameters plays an important role in\npreparing these runs, given the very low level of gravitational radiation they generate. So far we see that the\nmethod [34] developed for equal mass BHBs to lower the\neccentricity seems to work, but it requires extra runs for\ninitial experimentation. Hence it would be important to\nevolve initial data with lower spurious radiation content\nand some true inspiral wave information [35].\nWe gratefully acknowledge the NSF for financial support from Grants No. PHY-0722315, No. PHY-0653303,\nNo. PHY-0714388, No. PHY-0722703, No. DMS0820923, No. PHY-0929114, No. PHY-0969855, No.\nPHY-0903782, No. CDI-1028087; and NASA for financial support from NASA Grants No. 07-ATFP07-0158\nand No. HST-AR-11763.
