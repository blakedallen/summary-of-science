This extends\na result of Auslander and Bridger to rings of higher Krull dimension, and it\nalso improves a result due to Foxby where the ring is assumed to be CohenMacaulay.\n\n1. Introduction\nThroughout this paper, let R be a commutative Noetherian local ring. All Rmodules in this paper are assumed to be finitely generated.\nIn [1, Proposition 2.6 (a) and (d)] Auslander and Bridger proved the following.\nTheorem 1.1 (Auslander-Bridger). The following are equivalent:\n(1) R is quasi-Frobenius (i.e. Gorenstein with Krull dimension zero).\n(2) Every R-module can be embedded in a free R-module.\nOn the other hand, in [4, Theorem 2] Foxby showed the following.\nTheorem 1.2 (Foxby). The following are equivalent:\n(1) R is Gorenstein.\n(2) R is Cohen-Macaulay, and every R-module can be embedded in an R-module of\nfinite projective dimension.\nFor an R-module C we denote by addR C the class of R-modules which are direct\nsummands of finite direct sums of copies of C. The C-dimension of an R-module\nX, C-dimR X, is defined as the infimum of nonnegative integers n such that there\nexists an exact sequence\n0 \u2192 Cn \u2192 Cn\u22121 \u2192 * * * \u2192 C0 \u2192 X \u2192 0\nof R-modules with Ci \u2208 addR C for all 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n.\nIn this paper, we prove the following theorem. This result removes from Theorem\n1.2 the assumption that R is Cohen-Macaulay, and it extends Theorem 1.1 to rings\nof higher Krull dimension. It should be noted that our proof of this result is different\nfrom Foxby's proof for the special case C = R.\nTheorem 1.3. Let R be a commutative Noetherian local ring with residue field k.\nLet C be a semidualizing R-module of depth t. Then the following are equivalent:\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 13D05, 13H10.\nKey words and phrases. Gorenstein ring, Cohen-Macaulay ring, projective dimension, injective\ndimension, (semi)dualizing module.\nThe first and second authors were supported in part by Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B)\n19740008 from JSPS and by grant No. 88013211 from IPM, respectively.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nRYO TAKAHASHI, SIAMAK YASSEMI, AND YUJI YOSHINO\n\n(1) C is dualizing.\n(2) Every R-module can be embedded in an R-module of finite C-dimension.\n(3) The R-module Tr \u03a9t k \u2297R C can be embedded in an R-module of finite Cdimension. (Here Tr \u03a9t k denotes the transpose of the t-th syzygy of the Rmodule k.)\nMoreover, if one of these three conditions holds, then R is Cohen-Macaulay.\n2. Proof of Theorem 1.3 and its applications\nFirst of all, we recall the definition of a semidualizing module.\nDefinition 2.1. An R-module C is called semidualizing if the natural homomorphism R \u2192 HomR (C, C) is an isormophism and ExtiR (C, C) = 0 for all i > 0.\nNote that a dualizing module is nothing but a semidualizing module of finite\ninjective dimension. Another typical example of a semidualizing module is a free\nmodule of rank one. Recently a considerable number of authors have studied semidualizing modules and have obtained many results concerning these modules.\nWe denote by m the maximal ideal of R and by k the residue field of R. To\nprove our main theorem, we establish two lemmas.\nLemma 2.2. Let C be a semidualizing R-module. Let g : M \u2192 X be an injective\nhomomorphism of R-modules with C-dimR X < \u221e. If ExtiR (M, C) = 0 for any\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 C-dimR X, then the natural map \u03bbM : M \u2192 HomR (HomR (M, C), C) is\ninjective.\nProof. First of all we prove that M can be embedded in a module C0 in addR C.\nFor this we set n = C-dimR X. If n = 0, then this is obvious from the assumption,\nsince X \u2208 addR C. If n > 0, then there exists an exact sequence\nd\n\ndn\u22121\n\nd\n\nd\n\nn\nCn\u22121 \u2192 * * * \u21921 C0 \u21920 X \u2192 0\n0 \u2192 Cn \u2192\n\nwith Ci \u2208 addR C for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n. Putting Xi = Im di , we have exact sequences\n0 \u2192 Xi+1 \u2192 Ci \u2192 Xi \u2192 0 (0 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1).\n\u223c\nThen we have Ext1R (M, X1 ) = 0, since there are isomorphisms Ext1R (M, X1 ) =\nn\nn\n\u223c\n\u223c\nExt2R (M, X2 ) \u223c\n*\n*\n*\nExt\n(M,\nX\n)\nExt\n(M,\nC\n)\n=\n0.\nHence\nHom\n(M,\nd\n)\n=\n=\nn =\nn\nR\n0 :\nR\nR\nHomR (M, C0 ) \u2192 HomR (M, X) is surjective. This implies that the homomorphism\ng \u2208 HomR (M, X) is lifted to f \u2208 HomR (M, C0 ), i.e. d0 * f = g. Since g is injective,\nf is injective as well. Therefore M has an embedding f into C0 .\nTo prove that \u03bbM is injective, we note that \u03bbC0 is an isomorphism, because of\nC0 \u2208 addR C. Since there is an injective homomorphism f : M \u2192 C0 , the following\ncommutative diagram forces \u03bbM to be injective:\nM\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\u03bbM y\n\nf\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nC0\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\u03bbC0 y\u223c\n=\n\nHomR (HomR (f,C),C)\n\nHomR (HomR (M, C), C) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 HomR (HomR (C0 , C), C).\n\u0003\n\n\fEMBEDDINGS INTO MODULES OF FINITE HOMOLOGICAL DIMENSIONS\n\n3\n\nLemma 2.3. Let C be a semidualizing R-module and let M be an R-module. Assume that M is free on the punctured spectrum of R. Then there is an isomorphism\nExti (M, R) \u223c\n= Exti (M \u2297R C, C)\nR\n\nR\n\nfor each integer i \u2264 depthR C.\nProof. Set t = depthR C. Since C is semidualizing, we have a spectral sequence\np+q\nE2p,q = ExtpR (TorR\nq (M, C), C) \u21d2 ExtR (M, R).\n\nNote by assumption that the R-module TorR\nq (M, C) has finite length for q > 0. By\np,q\n[2, Proposition 1.2.10(e)] we have E2 = 0 if p < t and q > 0. Hence\nExti (M \u2297R C, C) = E i,0 \u223c\n= Exti (M, R)\n2\n\nR\n\nR\n\nfor i \u2264 t.\n\n\u0003\n\nLet M be an R-module. Take a free resolution\ndn+1\n\nd\n\ndn\u22121\n\nd\n\nn\nFn\u22121 \u2192 * * * \u21921 F0 \u2192 0)\nF\u2022 = (* * * \u2192 Fn \u2192\n\nof M . Then for a nonnegative integer n we define the n-th syzygy of M by the image\nof dn and denote it by \u03a9nR M or simply \u03a9n M . We also define the (Auslander) transpose of M by the cokernel of the map HomR (d1 , R) : HomR (F0 , R) \u2192 HomR (F1 , R)\nand denote it by TrR M or simply Tr M . Note that the n-th syzygy and the transpose of M are uniquely determined up to free summand. Note also that they commute with localization; namely, for every prime ideal p of R there are isomorphisms\n(\u03a9nR M )p \u223c\n= TrRp Mp up to free summand.\n= \u03a9nRp Mp and (TrR M )p \u223c\nRecall that for a positive integer n an R-module is called n-torsionfree if\nExtiR (Tr M, R) = 0\nfor all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. Now we can prove our main theorem.\nProof of Theorem 1.3. (1) \u21d2 (2): By virtue of [6, Theorem (3.11)], the local ring\nR is Cohen-Macaulay. Now assertion (2) follows from [4, Theorem 1].\n(2) \u21d2 (3): This implication is obvious.\n(3) \u21d2 (1): We denote by (\u2212)\u2020 the C-dual functor HomR (\u2212, C). Put t =\ndepthR C and set M = Tr \u03a9t k. Then we have depth R = t by [5]. Since\ngradeR ExtiR (k, R) \u2265 i \u2212 1\nfor 1 \u2264 i \u2264 t, the module \u03a9t k is t-torsionfree by [1, Proposition (2.26)]. Hence\nExtiR (M, R) = 0 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 t. As M is free on the punctured spectrum of R,\nLemma 2.3 implies ExtiR (M \u2297R C, C) = 0 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 t. By assumption (3),\nthe module M \u2297R C has an embedding into a module X with C-dimR X < \u221e.\nAccording to [7, Lemma 4.3], we have C-dimR X \u2264 t. Lemma 2.2 shows that the\nnatural map \u03bbM\u2297R C : M \u2297R C \u2192 (M \u2297R C)\u2020\u2020 is injective. On the other hand,\nsince there are natural isomorphisms\n(M \u2297R C)\u2020\u2020 = HomR (HomR (M \u2297R C, C), C) \u223c\n= HomR (HomR (M, HomR (C, C)), C)\n\u223c\n= HomR (HomR (M, R), C),\nwe see from [1, Proposition (2.6)(a)] that\nKer \u03bbM\u2297 C \u223c\n= Ext1 (\u03a9t k, C)\n= Ext1 (Tr M, C) \u223c\nR\n\nR\n\n\u223c\n= Extt+1\nR (k, C).\n\nR\n\n\f4\n\nRYO TAKAHASHI, SIAMAK YASSEMI, AND YUJI YOSHINO\n\nThus we obtain Extt+1\nR (k, C) = 0. By [3, Theorem (1.1)], the R-module C must\nhave finite injective dimension.\nAs we observed in the proof of the implication (1) \u21d2 (2), assertion (1) implies\nthat R is Cohen-Macaulay. Thus the last assertion follows.\n\u0003\nNow we give applications of our main theorem. Letting C = R in Theorem 1.3,\nwe obtain the following result. This improves Theorem 1.2 and extends Theorem\n1.1.\nCorollary 2.4. The following are equivalent:\n(1) R is Gorenstein.\n(2) Every R-module can be embedded in an R-module of finite projective dimension.\nCombining Corollary 2.4 with [4, Theorem 1], we have the following.\nCorollary 2.5. If every finitely generated R-module can be embedded in a finitely\ngenerated R-module of finite projective dimension, then every finitely generated Rmodule can be embedded in a finitely generated R-module of finite injective dimension.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors thank Sean Sather-Wagstaff and the referees for their kind comments and valuable suggestions.\nReferences\n[1] M.
