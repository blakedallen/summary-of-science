Apart from the advantage of making all-semiconducting spintronic devices accessible, one particular benefit of DMS is the possibility to control\ntheir electronic and magnetic properties by the same means\n[4]. Among the different II-VI and III-V semiconductor materials, GaN-based DMS have the potential to fulfill the requirement of high-temperature ferromagnetism for future spintronic\ndevices [5]. Room-temperature ferromagnetism in transitionmetal (TM) doped DMS, however, is often found to result from\nthe formation of precipitates rather than from a homogeneous\nalloy [6]. Rare-earth (RE) elements could be an interesting\nalternative, since they have partially filled f orbitals, which\ncarry magnetic moments and may contribute to magnetic coupling like in the case of TM with partially filled d orbitals.\nGd is the only RE element which has both partially filled 4 f\nand 5d orbitals. Together, these orbitals can take part in a new\ncoupling mechanism proceeding via intra-ion 4 f -5d exchange\ninteraction followed by inter-ion 5d-5d coupling mediated by\ncharge carriers [7]. Teraguchi et al. [8] observed a Curie temperature larger than 400 K in the Ga0.94 Gd0.06 N alloy. Very\nrecently, we have observed ferromagnetism above room temperature as well as an extraordinarily large magnetic moment\nof Gd in weakly Gd-doped GaN layers [9]. The average value\nof the magnetic moment per Gd ion is found to be as high as\n4000 \u03bcB as compared to its atomic moment of 8 \u03bcB . This finding suggests that the GaN matrix strongly contributes to the\nobserved macroscopic magnetization.\nOptical spectroscopy has been demonstrated to be a powerful experimental tool to study the interplay between electronic and magnetic properties in DMS [10, 11, 12]. In\nthis work, we used magneto-photoluminescence (MPL) spectroscopy to investigate the influence of Gd doping on the electronic properties of the GaN matrix. The energy and polarization of near-band-gap optical emission are expected to be directly influenced by spin splittings in the electronic band structure. We studied, in particular, the circular polarization of the\nMPL emission due to recombination of donor-bound excitons\n(D0 , X), which typically dominates the low-temperature PL in\nGaN. Our study reveals a strong Gd-induced spin splitting of\nthe valence band, which has an opposite sign as compared to\nthe Zeeman splitting in these samples.\nThe 600-nm-thick GaN:Gd layers were grown with Gd con-\n\ncentrations (NGd ) of 1.6 \u00d7 1016 (sample A) and 6 \u00d7 1016 cm\u22123\n(sample B) directly on 6H-SiC(0001) at a substrate temperature of 810 \u25e6 C using reactive molecular-beam epitaxy (RMBE)\n[9]. An undoped GaN reference sample was grown under\nidentical conditions. The concentration of Gd was determined\nby secondary-ion-mass spectrometry (SIMS) and found to be\nconstant over the entire depth. All samples were subject to\nan extensive investigation by high-resolution x-ray diffraction\nover a wide angular range. No reflections related to a secondary phase were detected. Furthermore, sample B was investigated by transmission electron microscopy. The layer did\nnot contain any clusters or precipitates. Electrically, all samples, including the reference sample, are found to be highly resistive. The magnetic properties of a series of Gd-doped GaN\nlayers, including samples A and B, have been systematically\ninvestigated by superconducting-quantum-interference-device\n(SQUID) magnetometry. Colossal magnetic moments of 3000\nand 1000 \u03bcB per Gd ion were found in samples A and B, respectively. Both samples are also found to exhibit ferromagnetism above room temperature. For MPL experiments, the\nsamples were excited by the linearly polarized emission of a\nHe-Cd ion laser at a wavelength of 325 nm. The laser power\ndensity focused on the sample was varied between 200 and\n250 Wcm\u22122 . Since the ferromagnetism in the GaN:Gd layers\nis not induced by free carriers (investigated layers are insulating) [9], we do not expect a significant change of the magnetic characteristics due to the small density of photocreated\ncarriers. The PL light was dispersed in a single-path spectrograph and detected by a charge-coupled device (CCD) array.\nThe experiments were carried out in the temperature range 5\u2013\n100 K in a continuous He-flow cryostat and in magnetic fields\nup to 12 T using the backscattering Faraday geometry. In all\nmeasurements, the magnetic field was oriented parallel to the\nc-axis of the samples. The magnetic field-induced circular polarization of the PL light was analyzed by passing it through\na photoelastic modulator (PEM), a quarter-wave plate, and a\nlinear polarizer.\nIn the absence of an external magnetic field, the PL spectra of all samples are characteristic for undoped epitaxial GaN\nlayers in that they are dominated by the (D0 , X) transition at\na photon energy of 3.458 eV. The lower energy of this transition, when compared to homoepitaxial GaN, is consistent with\nthe tensile in-plane strain in these layers of 0.15% [13]. In all\ncases, the donor responsible for this transition is oxygen with\n\n\f2\n0\n\nIntensity (arb. units)\n\n(a)\n\n(D ,X)\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c3\n\n+\n\n0\n\n(b)\n\n3.42\n\n\u03c3\n\n(D ,X)\n\n3.44\n\n3.46\n\n\u03c3\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c3\n\n+\n\n3.48\n\nPhoton Energy (eV)\nFIG. 1: Circularly polarized PL spectra for (a) the reference sample\nand (b) sample B measured at 7 K under a magnetic field of B = 10 T\nin the Faraday configuration (B k c).\n\na concentration of about 1018 cm\u22123 as measured by SIMS.\nSince these donors are distributed homogeneously over the entire GaN matrix, the (D0 , X) emission can be utilized as a probe\nfor the properties of the electronic band structure. The formation of Gd-O complexes can be neglected since there is only\none Gd ion available for hundreds of oxygen donors at our\nlow Gd-doping concentrations. Figure 1 shows the PL spectra for an undoped GaN reference sample and sample B under\nan external magnetic field of B = 10 T. The observed (D0 , X)\nemission is polarized in both samples, which is evident from\nthe difference in intensities of the two circularly polarized \u03c3 \u2212\n(full squares) and \u03c3 + (open squares) components. Most importantly, the polarization for sample B has the opposite sign\nof the one in the reference sample. This finding is remarkable\nsince it implies that a relatively small amount of Gd is able to\nreverse the sequence of Zeeman splitted states in a large volume fraction of the GaN matrix.\nThe (D0 , X) complex consists of three spin particles, two\nelectrons (one each in the donor and exciton) and one valence\nband hole (in the exciton). In the ground state, two electrons\nare in antiparallel spin orientation (singlet state), while the spin\nof the valence band hole is uncompensated. Consequently, the\ncircular polarization of the PL emission due to (D0 , X) recombination is determined only by the population of spin-up and\nspin-down states for holes. Note that, based on similar arguments, acceptor bound excitons (A0 , X) could be used to study\nthe influence of the Gd doping on electron states. The uncom-\n\npensated hole spin has a non-zero projection only along the caxis because the ground state of (D0 , X) in GaN is associated\nwith the A exciton. An external magnetic field along the c-axis\nthus splits the (D0 , X) ground state into two Zeeman sublevels\nwith up and down projection of the hole spin. Here we assume\nthat the Zeeman splitting (due to an external magnetic field)\nis much smaller than the singlet-triplet energy splitting of the\nelectron pair in the complex. Hence, the (D0 , X) emission is\nexpected to be composed of two types of circularly polarized\nlight (\u03c3 \u2212 and \u03c3 + ). The relative population of the two Zeeman sublevels determines the circular polarization degree of\nthe emitted light, which is defined as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2212\n+\n\u2206E(B)\nI\u03c3 \u2212 I\u03c3\n\u03c40\ntanh\n\u03c1 (B) = \u03c3 \u2212\n(1)\n+ =\n\u03c40 + \u03c4s\n2kB T\nI + I\u03c3\nwhere I\u03c3 denotes the intensity of the \u03c3 \u00b1 polarized light, kB\nthe Boltzmann constant and T the temperature. \u03c40 and \u03c4s are\nthe lifetime of the (D0 , X) transition and the spin-relaxation\ntime of the holes, respectively. To account for the variation\nof the spin-relaxation time with the magnetic field observed in\nRef. 14, we assume\n\u0012 \u0013\u2212\u03b3\nB\n\u03c4s\n(2)\n=\u03b1\n\u03c40\nB0\n\u00b1\n\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b3 are constants and B0 = 12 T the maximum magnetic field. Note that the spin relaxation time for electrons and\nholes can be expected to be similar because of the weak spinorbit interaction in GaN. Indeed, for semiconductor quantum\nwells and dots, having non-degenerate valence bands like in\nwurtzite GaN, long spin relaxation times between 1 and 20 ns\nhave been reported [15, 16]. \u2206E(B) = gh \u03bcB B is the energy separation between the Zeeman sublevels of holes at an external\nmagnetic field B. The g-factors for electrons ge (= 1.95 [17])\nand A-valence band holes gh ( = 2.25 [18]) are quite close to\neach other in GaN. Thus, the splitting between the \u03c3 \u2212 and \u03c3 +\npolarized (D0 , X) emission is expected to be \u2248 0.1 meV at B\n= 10 T, which is too small to be resolved. However, the same\nmagnetic field can produce a noticeable polarization of the PL\nemission as apparent from Fig. 1. The sign reversal of the\npolarization in sample B with respect to the reference sample\n(Fig. 1) implies that \u2206E(B) has changed its sign. For a magnetic semiconductor, \u2206E(B) = gh \u03bcB B + \u2206Eint , where \u2206Eint is\nthe additional splitting generated by the internal field produced\nby the magnetic atoms which can be regarded as a renormalization of the g-factor. In our case, \u2206Eint is evidently negative\nand stronger than the Zeeman term, which is possible only\nwhen the excitonic ground state is subject to a strong influence of the Gd ions. Since the Gd-doped samples also do not\nreveal any energy splitting between the \u03c3 \u2212 and \u03c3 + polarized\n(D0 , X) emission, we conclude that the conduction and valence\nbands are influenced in the way by the presence of Gd ions (see\narguments above).\nFigure 2 displays the (D0 , X) polarization \u03c1 as a function\nof magnetic field for sample A (circles), B (squares) and the\nreference sample (triangles).

While the reference sample exhibits, as expected, a nearly linear magneticfield dependence, a tendency toward saturation is observed in\nparticular for the Gd-doped sample B. It is also evident from\nFig. 2 that the relative change of the polarization with respect\nto the reference sample increases with the concentration of Gd.\nAll these findings confirm that a large fraction of excitons is\ninfluenced by the presence of Gd.\nA sign reversal and a qualitatively similar magnetic-field dependence of the polarization of the PL emission due to the\nrecombination of neutral Mn-acceptor-bound excitons (A0 , X)\nhas been observed in (Ga,Mn)As which is a III-V DMS. The\nobserved behavior of the PL polarization has been explained\nin terms of an antiferromagnetic coupling between the valence\nband hole and the Mn d-orbital [19]. In this case, however,\nthe excitons are bound to the magnetic dopant itself and are,\nconsequently, easily influenced by the Mn d-orbitals. On the\ncontrary, the excitons in our Gd-doped GaN layers are bound\nto O donors, which are homogeneously distributed within the\nmatrix. The mean Gd-Gd separation in sample B is 25 nm resulting in an average distance between a (D0 , X) site and a Gd\nion as large as 12 nm [20]. None of the existing theories can\nexplain a magnetic coupling across such a large distance [21].\nThe extraordinary situation encountered here becomes obvious when we attempt to analyze our data in the conventional\nframework valid for DMS such as (Ga,Mn)As, i. e. under\nthe assumption of a direct interaction between Gd ions and\n(D0 , X). It is then expected that the additional splitting \u2206Eint\nfollows the external-field dependence of the macroscopic magnetization. SQUID measurements reveal a ferromagnetic behavior in these samples with a saturation of the magnetization above B =2 T in both samples A and B. For the sake of\nsimplicity, let us consider sample B in the following example.\nA fit of Eq. (1) to \u03c1 obtained in the magnetization-saturation\nrange (cf. Fig. 2) yields \u2206Eint = \u22122.5 meV. However, \u2206Eint\n= N0 \u03b2 x\u03bcGd , where \u03bcGd = 8 \u03bcB is the bare atomic moment of\nGd, N0 is the number of Ga or N atoms per unit volume, x =\nNGd /N0 , and N0 \u03b2 is a constant which defines the strength of\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nMagnetic field B (T)\n\nFIG. 3: Circular polarization of the (D0 , X) emission as a function\nof the external magnetic field B measured at different temperatures\nfor sample B.

The corresponding value of N0 \u03b2 \u2248 \u2212200 eV is\ntwo orders of magnitude larger than the ones obtained in II-VI\nand III-V DMS and thus much too large to be physically meaningful. A reasonable value of N0 \u03b2 is only obtained when the\neffective magnetic moment per Gd ion is two orders of magnitude larger than its atomic moment of 8 \u03bcB , which is consistent\nwith the colossal magnetic moment of 1000 \u03bcB obtained from\nthe magnetization measurements on sample B. Repeating this\nanalyis for sample A, we obtain an even larger value for N0 \u03b2 ,\nin agreement with the fact that the measured magnetic moment\nper Gd ion is as high as 3000 \u03bcB in this sample. In agreement\nwith our previous conclusion,[9], we thus have to consider that\nthe Gd ions induce a magnetic moment in a large number of\nmatrix atoms (Ga and/or N) in order to understand the efficient\nspin-polarization of a large fraction of excitons by the Gd doping.\nTo account for this polarization of the matrix, we associate\na sphere of influence with each of the randomly positioned Gd\nions. Since the radius r of these spheres is presumably much\nlarger than the lattice spacing in GaN, we further assume that\nthe spheres are randomly arranged in a three-dimensional continuum (continuum percolation). The polarization \u03c1 of the\n\n\f4\n(D0 , X) emission can now be expressed as\n\n\u03c1 = (1 \u2212 y)\u03c1out + y\u03c1in\n\n(3)\n\nwhere y is the volume fraction of the regions occupied by the\nspheres of influence. Within the framework of continuum percolation, y can be expressed as\ny = 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c5 NGd\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c5 = 4\u03c0 r3 /3 is the volume of the sphere of influence.\nin and out are the contributions to the polarization by excitons\nbound to donors inside and outside the regions spanned by the\nspheres, respectively. Both \u03c1in and \u03c1out can be expressed by\nEq. (1), whereas \u2206E(B) is given by:\n\u2206Eout (B) = gh \u03bcB B\n\u2206Ein (B) = gh \u03bcB B + \u2206Eint.\n\n(5)\n\nThe values of \u03b1 and \u03b3 (cf. Eq. 2) are expected to be different inside and outside the regions occupied by the spheres\nof influence. \u03c4s (B) for regions not occupied by a sphere of influence is required to be identical to the one in undoped GaN,\nwhich can be obtained from a fit to the data for the reference\nsample by Eq. (1).\nNext, we use this model to fit the experimental field dependence of the polarization at 7 K (Fig. 2). The data which are\nobtained in the saturation range of the magnetization (B > 2 T)\n[9], are only taken in to account in this fitting. \u2206Eint could thus\nbe considered as a constant in this range. Only \u03b1 , \u03b3 and y are\nused as fit parameters. Note that the hysteresis at B <2 T cannot be resolved by our magneto-PL setup, since the coercive\nfield (0.01 T) as well as the remanent magnetization are too\nsmall [9]. The central result of this approach is that satisfactory fits are obtained only with finite values for y, particularly\nso for sample B, for which y has to be very close to unity. A\nvolume fraction of y = 1 means that the entire matrix is under the influence of the Gd ions, i. e., the radius of the sphere\nof influence is close to the average Gd-Gd spacing (25 nm)\nin this sample. Consequently, the fitting procedure was first\napplied to the reference sample and to sample B, representing\nthe cases of y = 0 and y = 1, respectively. The obtained values\nof \u03b1 and \u03b3 were subsequently taken into account to calculate\nthe polarization curve of sample A using only \u2206Eint and y as\nfit parameters. This fit yields r = 17.2 nm, which is close to\nthe value obtained for sample B demonstrating the consistency\nof this approach. The relation between the volume fraction y\nand the magnetic moment per Gd ion is explained in detail in\nRef. 9.\nA further test of our model is given by the temperature\ndependence obtained for sample B. As shown in Fig. 3, our\nmodel is able to reproduce the data with reasonable values for\nall fit parameters (Tab. I). Furthermore, the temperature dependence of \u2206Eint is in reasonable agreement with the decrease\nin saturation magnetization observed in the SQUID measurements. Finally, we point out that our findings are consistent\nwith the size of the Gd sphere (r \u2248 30 nm) estimated in Ref. 9\nto account for the colossal magnetic moment per Gd ion observed in these samples, which provides further quantitative\n\nsupport in favor of a long-range interaction of Gd with the\nGaN matrix.\nOur study reveals an extraordinarily large effect of Gd on\nthe electronic states in GaN. It is observed that even a Gd concentration as low as 1.6 \u00d7 1016 cm\u22123 can significantly influence the spin splitting of the conduction and valence bands.\nThis unprecedented effect can be explained only in terms of a\nlong-range induction of magnetic moments in the GaN matrix\nby the Gd ions. This conclusion is consistent with the colossal magnetic moment per Gd ion and ferromagnetism with\nTC > 300 K observed in these samples. Our results are, in particular, interesting for spintronic applications, since GaN:Gd\nmay be easily doped with donors (acceptors) with a concentration exceeding that of Gd to generate spin-polarized electrons\n(holes) in the conduction band (valence band). Gd-doped GaN\nwith its Curie temperature above room temperature may thus\nbe a very attractive candidate as a spin-injector material for\nall-semiconducting devices [22].\nWe are grateful to H. T.
