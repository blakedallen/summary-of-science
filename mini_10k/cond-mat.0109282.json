INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Holstein model, as a paradigm for polaron formation, has attracted renewed interest in recent years because several lines of experimental evidence support the presence of\npolaron carriers in strongly correlated electronic materials, including colossal magnetoresistance manganites [1], organics [2], quasi-1d systems, and high-Tc cuprates [3,4]. Theoretical\nresearch on polaron physics began six decades ago, and the problem remains unsolved due to\nits intrinsic many-body complexity from the electron-phonon interaction. (The problem of\nexcitons coupled to phonons is formally equivalent [5].) Standard perturbation treatments\n[6,7] are usually limited to a particular parameter regime. With constantly growing computational resources, various numerical techniques have been applied to polaron problems\nin recent years, which give the most reliable results in the physically interesting crossover\nregime. These techniques include finite-cluster exact diagonalization (ED) [8\u201313], quantum\nMonte Carlo (QMC) [14,15], density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) [16], and the\nglobal-local variational method (GLVM) [17].\nRecent numerical studies have focused on the 1D lattice model. Due to the enormous\nphonon Hilbert space in three dimensions, the dimensionality effects on the polaron problems are less studied except in the adiabatic (or semiclassical) approximations [18,19], and\nin perturbation theory [20]. QMC is also capable of computing the energy and effective\nmass of the 3D polaron, but the full dispersion E(~k) is only reliable in the strong-coupling\nregime. However, with a recently developed variational method, we can compute the polaron\neffective mass, band dispersion, and el-ph correlation functions of the ground and low-lying\nexcited states in all coupling regimes, preserving the full quantum dynamical feature of\nphonons (details can be found in Ref. [21]). The variational space is defined on an infinite\nlattice, although only a finite separation is allowed between the electron and the surrounding phonons in current implementations. We systematically expand the variational space so\nthat highly accurate results can be achieved with modest computational resources.\nThe main purpose of this paper is to characterize the Holstein polaron in higher dimensions. We consider a single-electron Holstein Hamiltonian on a D-dimensional hypercubic\nlattice,\nH = He + Hel-ph + Hph\n= \u2212t\n\nX\n\n<i,j>\n\n(c\u2020i cj + h.c.) \u2212 \u03bb\n\nX\nj\n\nc\u2020j cj (aj + a\u2020j ) + \u03c9\n\nX\n\na\u2020j aj ,\n\n(1)\n\nj\n\nwhere c\u2020j creates an electron and a\u2020j creates a phonon on site j. The parameters of the model\nare the nearest-neighbor hopping integral t, the el-ph coupling strength \u03bb, and the phonon\nfrequency \u03c9. The electron is coupled locally to a dispersionless optical phonon mode [22].\nThere are two commonly defined dimensionless control parameters, the adiabaticity ratio\n\u03b3 = \u03c9/t, and the el-ph coupling strength \u03b1 = Ep /2Dt, which is defined as the ratio of\npolaron energy for an electron confined to a single site Ep = \u03bb2 /\u03c9, and the free electron half\nbandwidth 2Dt. The strong (weak) coupling regime refers to \u03b1 > 1 (< 1), and the adiabatic\n(antiadiabatic) regime refers to \u03b3 < 1 (> 1). An additional dimensionless parameter is\ng = \u03bb/\u03c9, which appears in strong-coupling perturbation theory.\nA variational space is constructed beginning with a root state, the electron at the origin\nwith no phonon excitations, and acting repeatedly with the off-diagonal terms (t and \u03bb) in\n2\n\n\fthe Hamiltonian, Eq. 1. States in generation m are those that can be created by acting\nm times with off-diagonal terms. All translations of these states on an infinite lattice are\nincluded, and the problem is diagonalized for a given momentum ~k using a Lanczos method\n[21]. A small variational space, with 7 states per electron site (unit cell), is shown in Fig.\n1. (The more accurate numerical computations are done with over 107 states per unit cell.)\nThe total number of states Nst per unit cell after m generations increases exponentially,\nas (D + 1)m , where D is the spatial dimension. (The bipolaron has the same (D + 1)m\ndependence, but with a larger prefactor.) The perhaps surprising fact is that while the\nsize of the Hilbert space grows exponentially with m, the error in the ground state energy\ndecreases exponentially, because states are added in a fairly efficient order. Figure 2 shows\nthe fractional error in the ground state energy as a function of the number of basis states\nin Hilbert space. The accuracy is determined by comparing the energy as the size of the\nHilbert space is increased. At intermediate coupling in any dimension, the energy improves\nby about a factor of 8 with each generation [23]. In 1D, each added generation approximately\ndoubles the size of the Hilbert space, whereas in 4D, the size increases five-fold. This rapid\nconvergence at intermediate-coupling is valuable since no analytic approach is reliable in this\nregime. Table I lists the energies for 1D to 4D polarons at intermediate- to weak-coupling.\nThe accuracy, 21 digits for 1D polaron, is high compared to that of other numerical methods,\nsuch as 2 or 3 digits for QMC, 6 digits for DMRG (or GLVM), and up to 8 digits for ED\n[24]. Moreover, for the 3D polaron at intermediate- to strong-coupling, an energy accuracy\nof 8-10 decimal places can be achieved in the nonadiabatic regime with fewer than 3 \u00d7 106\nbasis states. To obtain an accuracy beyond 13 digits, the code is executed in quadruple\nprecision. The present variational method requires only power-law time to achieve a given\naccuracy (in any dimension), which is a qualitative improvement on exact diagonalization\nas it is currently implemented, the latter requiring exponential time.\nIn this paper we present detailed studies of the dimensionality effect on the Holstein\npolaron. First of all, we explore the polaron characteristics in the k = 0 ground state, and\ncompare our results with previous studies from QMC, DMRG, and dynamical mean-field\ntheory (DMFT). Secondly, we compute the el-ph correlation function and the polaron energy\nE(~k). Finally, the validity of the Toyozawa variational method is investigated by calculating\nthe ground-state energy, and the 2-point and 3-point el-ph correlation functions.\nII. SMALL-POLARON CROSSOVER\nA. Quasiparticle weight Zk and effective mass m\u2217\n\nThe small polaron crossover or \"self-trapping transition\" has been one of the core issues\nin polaron problems. Adiabatic theory suggests that the polaron in 2D and 3D (but not\nin 1D), is in an \"extended\" state with an infinite radius below an el-ph coupling threshold\n\u03bbc , and beyond which is a \"localized\" state with infinite effective mass. (This phenomenon\nis usually termed the \"self-trapping transition\".) However, our studies confirm that in\nall dimensions, there is a crossover rather than a self-trapping transition (ground state\nproperties are analytic), if the parameters are finite. This result is consistent with some\nother recent studies [20,14] and corroborates the theorem of Gerlach and L\u00f6wen [25].\n\n3\n\n\fThe quasiparticle weight (renormalization factor) is defined by the overlap (squared)\nbetween the bare electron and a polaron, i.e.,\n2\n\nZk = h\u03a80,k |c\u2020k |0i ,\n\n(2)\n\nin which |\u03a80,k i is the ground state wavefunction of a polaron and |0i is the vacuum state. Zk\ncan be measured in photoemission or tunneling experiments. Figure 3 shows the crossover\nof Z~k=0 as a function of 1/\u03b1 at g = 3, for 1D to 4D cases. We see that the crossover to\nlarge effective mass of the higher-dimensional polaron is much sharper than the 1D polaron.\nFor D > 1, a fairly abrupt crossover occurs at \u03b1 > 1, whereas the crossover for the 1D\npolaron spans a wide range of \u03b1. With a smaller g (but greater than 1), the crossover\nwill be slower but with the same dimensional characteristics. In the limit 1/\u03b1 \u2192 0, the\nphonon wavefunction contracts to the electron site, with Zk = exp(\u2212g 2 ). The inset shows a\ncomparison of Zk and m0 /m\u2217 for the 1D polaron. Their fractional difference \u03b4, defined as\n(m0 /m\u2217 \u2212 Zk )/Zk , is shown as a dotted line. The maximum \u03b4 is 22%, in the intermediate\ncoupling regime, while the minimum occurs as 1/\u03b1 \u2192 0 (small t), where \u03b4 is the order of t2\nfrom strong-coupling perturbation theory (SCPT). We find that \u03b4 decreases significantly as\nthe dimension increases.\n\u221a The maximum difference \u03b4max is 4.5% for the 2D, and 2.0% for the\n3D polaron. For g = 5, \u03b4max in 3D drops to 0.63%.\nThe ground state energy E satisfies E = \u01eb0 \u2212 2t cos(k) + \u03a3(k, E), where \u03a3(k, E) is the\nself-energy. Zk=0 is the probability of the wavefunction on the root site, and from first order\nperturbation theory Zk=0 = \u2202E/\u2202\u01eb0 , resulting in Zk=0 = 1/[1 \u2212 \u2202\u03a3(k, E)/\u2202E]. The origin of\nthe difference between the inverse mass and Zk=0 lies in the k-dependence of the self-energy,\n1 \u2202 2 \u03a3(k, E)\n\u2202\u03a3(k, E)\nm0\n\u2212\nZ\n=\n/\n(1\n\u2212\n),\nk=0\nm\u2217\n2t\n\u2202k 2\n\u2202E\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the derivatives are evaluated at the ground state energy E = E0 and k = 0. In the\nvariational space of Fig. 1 or in the full space, the self-energy has nonzero k-dependence\nbecause distinct unit cells are connected at branch level (path 1 \u2212 2 \u2212 3 . . .), in addition to\nthe trivial connection at root level. A restricted variational space, the comb basis, allows\nphonon excitations only on the electron site, as shown in Fig. 4. In this subspace, the selfenergy is k-independent, since the only path between unit cells is at the root level. The\nself-energy remains k-independent even in a larger space in which the tree trunks sprout\nlateral branches, so long as the branches do not connect to neighboring unit cells. For these\ncases, the Z factor and inverse mass are identical, \u03b4 = 0. In O(t) SCPT, \u03b4 vanishes for the\nsame reason and Zk=0 = m0 /m\u2217 = exp(\u2212g 2 ).\nThe effect of dimensionality on \u03b4 is made plausible by the following. In the Holstein\nmodel, the dimensionality D does not directly affect the term Hel-ph in Eq. 1, because the\nel-ph coupling is local and the phonon is dispersionless. High dimensional polarons share the\nsame simplicity of the el-ph coupling as 1D. Furthermore, we see (in next section) that the\nel-ph correlation length decreases as D increases. Thus the k-dependence of the self-energy\nweakens in higher dimensions. The above arguments do not, however, hold for the Fr\u00f6hlich\nmodel (or the extended Holstein model) with longer-range el-ph coupling [26\u201328], where Zk\nand m0 /m\u2217 behave quite differently.\n\n4\n\n\fB. Comparison with QMC, DMRG and DMFT\n\nFigure 5 shows our results for the effective mass as a function of \u03b1 (at fixed \u03b3 = 1.0) in\ncomparison with DMRG and QMC. Our results are accurate to at least four digits, which is\nwell below the linewidth. In all cases, Fig. 5(a)-(c), m\u2217 /m0 increases slowly when \u03b1 is small,\nfollowed by a rapid increase when \u03b1 > 1. Since it is calculated at \u03c9 = t = 1.0 (not a small\nt), the mass behaves differently than exp(g 2 ) that SCPT suggests. Note that the crossover\nis more rapid as D increases, which is consistent with the results in previous section. In\nevery dimension, our results are in quantitative agreement with QMC. The numerical error\nin QMC is approximately 0.1% to 0.3% [14], which is good though less accurate than finite\ncluster ED or the present approach. DMRG is generally considered a powerful tool in\ndealing with many-body problems. Using DMRG, Jeckelmann and White have calculated\nHolstein polaron properties in 1D and 2D. DMRG seems to be most successful calculating\nthe ground state energy (at k = 0) and el-ph correlation functions. However, finite-size\nscaling is required for DMRG to compute m\u2217 [16], which becomes more difficult for D > 1.\nIn 1D, Fig. 5(a), the results from DMRG are as accurate as QMC. DMRG does not, however,\ncalculate the mass accurately in 2D, Fig. 5(b).\nDynamical mean-field theory has previously been applied to the Holstein polaron problem\n[29]. The approach is exact in infinite dimensions but an interpolation to 3D lattices is\nmade possible by using a semielliptical free density of states N(E) to mimic the low-energy\nfeatures. Figure 6 shows a comparison of our results on a cubic lattice to DMFT, which is\nmade by setting the bandwidths equal. Overall, in panel (a), we see a qualitative agreement\nbetween the two calculations. DMFT is accurate in the strong-coupling regime, where the\nsurrounding phonons are predominately on the electron site. This is also the regime where\nstrong-coupling perturbation theory works well. In Fig. 6(b), we see our numerical results in\nagreement with weak-coupling perturbation theory in \u03bb. However, DMFT fails to compute\nm\u2217 correctly in the weak-coupling regime. The reason is that in DMFT, the lattice problem\nis mapped onto a self-consistent local impurity model [30,31], which preserves the interplay\nof the electron and the phonons only at the local level. We will see that the spatial extent of\nthe el-ph correlations increases as the el-ph coupling decreases, which explains the significant\ndiscrepancy in the weak-coupling regime. It is also worth noting that DMFT neglects the k\ndependence of self-energy, i.e., the inverse effective mass is always equal to the quasiparticle\nweight. As we have pointed out above, the difference between m0 /m\u2217 and Zk is not negligible\nin the intermediate- to weak-coupling regime.\nIII. ELECTRON-PHONON CORRELATIONS\n\nNext, we compute the correlation function between the electron and the phonon displacement (lattice deformation) in the ground state,\n\u03c7(i \u2212 j) = h\u03a80 |c\u2020i ci (aj + a\u2020j )|\u03a80 i.\n\n(4)\n\nThis correlation function can be considered as a measure of the polaron size [32]. It should\nnot be confused with the \"polaron radius\" in the extreme adiabatic limit, which refers to\nthe spatial extent of a symmetry-breaking localized state. We would like to emphasize that\n5\n\n\fa comprehensive study of el-ph correlation for the ground state of the 3D polaron has not\nyet been reported by any other modern numerical technique [33]. The on-site correlation\nhas been studied by DMFT and the results are compared in Fig. 7 [34]. The on-site lattice\ndistortion \u03c7(0) is shown as function of \u03b1 and the rest of parameters are the same as Fig. 6.\nIn Fig. 7, \u03c7(0) is normalized to 1 when \u03b1 is infinite (i.e. t \u2192 0) according to lim \u03c7(0) = 2g.\nt\u21920\nAgain, we obtain good qualitative agreement. The curves show an abrupt change in slope\nonly for large g, where the discrepancy with DMFT is largest.\nFigure 8 shows the effect of dimensionality on the correlation function \u03c7(i \u2212 j). In the\nstrong-coupling regime, panel (a) shows, in every dimension, a sharp drop on the first two\nsites and an exponentially decaying tail. For the 3D polaron at a distance of 3 lattice sites,\n\u03c7(3)/\u03c7(0) drops below 10\u22124. In the weak-coupling regime, panel (b), \u03c7 has nearly a simple\nexponential decay with a less steep slope, which implies a nontrivial extent of the el-ph\ninterplay in space. In both panels, we observe a common trend that \u03c7 decays more rapidly\nas the lattice dimension increases, i.e., the surrounding phonons are more localized near the\nelectron in higher dimensions. This feature enables DMFT to give sensible results in higher\nfinite dimensions. We have also investigated other 2-point el-ph correlation functions such\nas hc\u2020i ci a\u2020j aj i (not shown), which has dimensional characteristics similar to \u03c7.\nThe rapid decay of the el-ph correlation function for the higher-dimensional polaron\nsuggests that the off-site el-ph interplay is relatively weak in large D. One would then\nexpect the comb basis of Fig. 4, a subspace of the full Hilbert space, to give a better\napproximation in large D. We check this assumption by numerically calculating the fraction\nof the probability density in the exact ground state that resides in the comb subspace,\nPcomb = h\u03a80 |P\u0302 |\u03a80 i,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere P\u0302 is the projection operator onto the comb subspace and the wavefunction \u03a80 is\nobtained in the full variational space. Figure 9 shows Pcomb as a function of the inverse bare\ncoupling constant 1/\u03b1 for 1-4D cases. In both of the limits \u03b1 = 0 or \u03b1 = \u221e, Pcomb goes to\n1. The minimum overlap occurs in the crossover regime. As expected, Pcomb gets closer to 1\nas D increases. For the 3D polaron, the minimum of Pcomb is 91.1%, in contrast to 45.8% for\n1D. These trends can also be seen analytically. In the adiabatic limit (\u03c9 = 0), perturbing in\n1\nt from a self-trapped state with energy Ep , the self-trapping transition occurs at \u03b1 = 1 \u2212 4D\n.\nThe leading order correction of Pcomb for the self-trapped polaron state is\n\nIn the non-adiabatic limit, \u2206comb\nt. It takes the following form:\n\u2206comb\n\n\u2206comb \u2261 1 \u2212 Pcomb\n1\n.\n(6)\n=\n8D\u03b12\ncan be calculated by SCPT to second order in the hopping\n\n2 \u221e\n\u221e\nX\ng 4e\u22122g X\ng 2(n+m)\n1\n=\n.\n2\n2D\u03b1 n=0 m=1 n! m! (n + m)2\n\n(7)\n\nThe above expressions show that for a given \u03b1 and g, the discrepancy \u2206comb decreases as\nD increases and eventually vanishes in infinite D. The comb basis should thus give a good\naccount for the Holstein problem in large D. We see in Fig. 3, however, that dimension 3 is\nnot high enough for the comb to give quantitatively accurate results, and that dimension 4\nis not much better. Convergence to higher dimensions is slow.\n6\n\n\f~\nIV. ENERGY DISPERSION E(K)\n\nMost of the recently developed numerical methods are capable of computing the polaron\nband dispersion in 1D. For the 2D polaron, the only non-perturbative calculations of band\ndispersion published so far were computed by finite-cluster ED [11] and Quantum Monte\nCarlo [15]. Due to the huge phonon Hilbert space in high dimensions, the previous ED\nresults are limited to small clusters, so that the band dispersion can only be evaluated at a\nfew ~k points. The QMC allows calculation of energy at any desired ~k point, but is limited\nto the condition that the polaron bandwidth is much smaller than the phonon frequency,\nwhich corresponds to the strong-coupling regime.\nThe present variational approach, however, is not subject to any of the above restrictions\n[21]. Figure 10(a) shows the evolution of the band dispersion for the 3D polaron along\nsymmetry directions in the Brillouin zone at various el-ph coupling constants \u03bb. Figure\n10(b) shows the corresponding Zk . Starting with weak coupling \u03bb = 2.0 (dashed line),\nthe polaron band is close to the bare electron band at lower band edge. The deviation\nbetween them increases as ~k increases. When E(k) \u2212 E(0) approaches \u03c9, we observe a\nband flattening effect, similar to the 1D and 2D cases, accompanied by a sharp drop of\nquasiparticle weight Zk . The large k lowest energy state can be considered roughly as \"a\nk = 0 polaron ground state\" plus \"an itinerant (or weakly-bound) phonon with momentum\nk\". It is the phonon that carries the momentum so as to make Zk essentially vanish and\ngive a bandwidth E(\u03c0) \u2212 E(0) = \u03c9. Due to the large extent of the el-ph correlations in\nthe flattened band, our results are less accurate in the flattened regime [35]. In the case\nof intermediate coupling \u03bb = 3.5, the polaron bandwidth is narrower than the phonon\nfrequency. The upper part of the band has much less dispersion than the lower part but\nwith a substantial Zk . This indicates a distinct mechanism for the crossover as a function\nof ~k. In the case of \u03bb = 4.5, the strong el-ph interaction leads to the well-known polaron\nband collapse and a significant suppression of Zk at all k.\nV. TOYOZAWA VARIATIONAL METHOD\n\nFour decades ago, a simple and intuitive variational approach to the 1D polaron problem\nwas proposed by Toyozawa [36]. This method has been successfully applied to various fields\nand revisited in a number of guises [37,38] throughout the years. It is generally believed to\nprovide a qualitatively correct description of the polaron ground state, aside from predicting\na spurious discontinuous change in the mass at intermediate coupling. We show below that\nalthough the Toyozawa wavefunction gives a good account of the ground state energy and\nthe 2-point functions, it fails to correctly describe the 3-point functions.\nThe Toyozawa wavefunction is written as a product of coherent states,\n|\u03a8T (k)i =\n\nX\nj\n\neikj c\u2020j |0i\n\nY\nm\n\n|zj+m i ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere |zi i is a coherent state of the phonon mode on site i. In the antiadiabatic limit \u03c9/t \u2192\n\u221e, this wavefunction gives the exact solution c\u2020j |0i|zj i, where zj = \u03bb/\u03c9 and the other z \u2032 s are\nzero. For the general case, momentum k = 0, the z \u2032 s are real and symmetric: zj+m = zj\u2212m .\nTo determine the validity of the Toyozawa wavefunction, we probe the structure of the\n7\n\n\fphonon cloud in the k = 0 ground state by computing the following 2-point and 3-point\nel-ph correlation functions,\n\u03b12 (j) \u2261 hc\u20200 c0 a\u2020j aj i ,\n\n(9)\n\n\u03b13 (j, m) \u2261 hc\u20200 c0 a\u2020j aj a\u2020m am i.\n\n(10)\n\nThe z \u2032 s in Eq. 8 are optimized so as to give a minimum energy. It can be proved that the\noptimal z \u2032 s decay exponentially as a function of el-ph separation. Thus it always gives purely\nexponentially decaying 2-point functions regardless of the el-ph coupling. This, however, is\nnot true of the numerically exact results. Table II and Fig. 11 compare Toyozawa's and\nthe numerically exact results for intermediate coupling [39]. We notice that the Toyozawa\nwavefunction gives reasonably accurate results for the ground state energy, 2-point functions,\nand Zk=0. In Table II, the fractional error in energy is about 1% (with zj+1 /zj = 0.35568\nand z0 = 0.57033). However, it gives wildly inaccurate 3-points functions. For example, the\nToyozawa \u03b13 (1, \u22122) is a factor of 36 too large and \u03b13 (1, 2) is a factor of 2 too small. The\nToyozawa \u03b13 (5, \u22126) is too large by 6 orders of magnitude. This failure indicates that the\nelectron does not organize its surrounding phonon cloud in the way that Toyozawa suggested.\nInstead, by directly analyzing the exact ground state wavefunction, we find that the electron\norganizes its surrounding phonons like a traveling salesman does, namely, the polaron favors\nthe phonon configuration with a shorter creation path. (The length of the creation path\nis the number of off-diagonal operations, phonon creations and electron hops, required to\ncreate a state from the bare electron state. Shorter paths are favored at intermediate or\nweak el-ph coupling, although more on-site phonons can be favored at large coupling.) For\nexample, we have,\nD\n\n\u03a80 c\u20200 a\u20200 |0\n\nE\n\n>\n\nD\n\n\u03a80 c\u20200 a\u20201 |0\n\nE\n\n>\n\nD\n\nE\n\n>\n\nD\n\n\u03a80 c\u20200 a\u20202 |0\n\nE\n\n> ...\n\nin the 1-phonon subspace and\nD\n\n\u03a80 c\u20200 a\u20200 a\u20200 |0\n\nE\n\n>\n\nD\n\n\u03a80 c\u20200 a\u20201 a\u20201 |0\n\n\u03a80 c\u20200 a\u20201 a\u2020\u22121 |0\n\nE\n\n> ...\n\nin the 2-phonon subspace. The amplitude attenuates rapidly as the phonon-creation path\nincreases.\nThe numerically exact result in Fig. 11(b) shows that it is far more favorable to create\ntwo phonon excitations on the same side of the electron than on opposite sides. Therefore,\nwe propose to write a polaron as a sum of two asymmetric clouds, one extending like a\ncomet-tail primarily off to the right and the other extending to the left,\n|\u03a8\u2032T (k)i =\n\nX\nj\n\neikj c\u2020j |0i (. . . |zj\u22122 i|zj\u22121i|zj i|zj+1i|zj+2 i . . . +\n. . . |zj+2 i|zj+1i|zj i|zj\u22121i|zj\u22122i . . .) ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere zj\u2212m 6= zj+m , and the normalization factor has been omitted. The optimized (minimum energy) phonon wavefunction in Eq. 11 is strongly asymmetric, and in fact changes\nsign on one side, as shown in Table III. The main purpose of Eq. 11 is to investigate how\nthe simplest asymmetric wavefunction improves the Toyozawa method. Shore and Sander\nhave proposed a more complicated wavefunction |\u03a8IV\nSS i which is a sum of the symmetric\n8\n\n\fterm in Eq. 8 and the two asymmetric terms in Eq. 11 [40]. (Asymmetric wavefunctions\nare also considered in Ref. [37].) The number of independent variables in \u03a8T , \u03a8\u2032T , and \u03a8IV\nSS\nis 21 N, N, and 32 N respectively, where N is the number of sites that allow phonon excitations. The minimum energies from the above methods are compared in Fig. 12. It is\nclear that the energies are improved as we expand the variational space, \u03a8T \u2282 \u03a8\u2032T \u2282 \u03a8IV\nSS .\nThe Shore-Sander method shows the most substantial improvement in the crossover regime.\nThe comparison of other polaron properties is shown in Table II and Fig. 11. Our trial\nwavefunction |\u03a8\u2032T i improves the energy by 30% and the k = 0 Z-factor by 50% compared\nto 75% and 66% respectively from Shore-Sander wavefunction. In Fig. 11(a), Eq. 11 gives a\nmore accurate 2-point function \u03b12 (j) than the original Toyozawa. It similarly improves the\nother 2-point function \u03c7j (not shown). Panel (b) shows two 3-point functions, \u03b13 (j, j + 1)\nand \u03b13 (j, \u2212j \u2212 1). Due to its symmetric phonon cloud, the Toyozawa wavefunction must\ngive exactly the same result for the two 3-point functions. In contrast, the exact results\nshow that \u03b13 (j, j + 1) \u226b \u03b13 (j, \u2212j \u2212 1). Equation 11 gives the correct behavior of the two\n3-point functions on nearby sites, but loses quantitative accuracy in the tails. Although\nthe Shore-Sander energy is better than that of Eq. 11, the Shore-Sander 3-point functions\nare actually worse. The simplest attempt |\u03a8\u2032T i to correct the identified shortcomings in the\nToyozawa variational wavefunction appears to be a step in the right direction, although not\nas quantitatively accurate for most properties as variational methods with more parameters\n[17,41].\nVI. CONCLUSION\n\nIn summary, we have performed extensive numerical studies of the Holstein polaron in\nspatial dimensions 1 through 4. The numerical method used adds basis states to the Hilbert\nspace in an efficient order, resulting in an error that scales as a power of the size of the\nHilbert space Nst\u2212\u03b8 , where \u03b8 is a nonuniversal exponent \u2248 3 at intermediate coupling in 1D,\nand \u2248 1.6 in 3D. This is a qualitative improvement over standard exact diagonalization,\nwhich requires exponential effort to achieve a given accuracy. Using modest computational\nresources, we obtain by far the most accurate polaron energies and wavefunctions available\nfrom 1D to 4D at intermediate coupling.\nPreviously, a thorough investigation of the dimensionality effect, including correlation\nfunctions, was out of reach of numerical methods. The main findings of the dimensionality\neffects on the the Holstein polaron are summarized as follows: The crossover from quasi-free\nto large effective mass is found to be much sharper in higher dimensions. As was recognized\npreviously, there is no symmetry-breaking self-trapping transition for finite parameters in\nany dimension, as suggested by adiabatic theory (although there is a phase transition in the\nfirst excited state [21]). See also Ref. [29]. Our results for m\u2217 agree with QMC, although there\nis a discrepancy with DMRG in D > 1. The electron-phonon correlation functions decay\nsignificantly faster in higher than lower dimensions. This implies a shorter el-ph correlation\nlength in large dimensions and leads to a diminishing difference between the inverse effective\nmass m0 /m\u2217 and the wave function renormalization Z~k=0 as D increases. The DMFT\napproach thus gives better results in higher dimensions. Our comparison shows that DMFT\ngives qualitatively correct results for the effective mass, mean phonon number, and on-site\nphonon distortion in the intermediate- to strong-coupling regime. We also examine the\n9\n\n\fcomb-basis approach which limits the el-ph correlation to the on-site level as DMFT does.\nThe discrepancy between the comb basis and the full basis decreases slowly as D increases.\nFinally, our approach is compared to the well-known Toyozawa variational method. We\nquantitatively examine the method in the intermediate-coupling regime. Overall, the Toyozawa wavefunction gives reasonably accurate energy and 2-point functions, but fails seriously for the 3-point functions. (The numerically exact 3-point functions are quite different\nfor excitations on opposite sides of the electron compared to the same side, whereas the\nToyozawa wavefunction predicts that they are identical.) We propose an improved variational wavefunction, a sum of two asymmetric phonon clouds (Eq. 11), which gives improved\n3-point functions, and somewhat more accurate results for the energy, Z-factor, and 2-point\nel-ph correlation functions.\nFor all the polaron features calculated, the present numerical approach compares favorably to other numerical methods in terms of accuracy, ease of implementation, and the\nability to compute ground and excited state energies and correlation functions. It can also\nbe directly applied to study the effects of dimensionality on other interesting problems,\nsuch as the Fr\u00f6hlich model or extended Holstein model with longer range electron-phonon\ninteractions, and to bipolaron problems.\nThe authors are grateful to S.
