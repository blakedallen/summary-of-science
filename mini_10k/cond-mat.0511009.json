We report on mutual proximity effects in d-wave superconductor/half-metal heterostructures which correspond to\nsystems composed of high-Tc cuprates and manganite materials. In our study, proximity effects are induced by the interplay\nof two separate interface effects: spin-mixing (or rotation) surface scattering and spin-flip scattering. The surface spin-mixing\nscattering introduces spin-triplet pairing correlations in superconducting side; as a result, Andreev bound states are formed at\nenergies within the superconducting gap. The spin-flip scattering introduces not only long range equal-spin pairing amplitudes\nin the half-metal, but also an exotic magnetic proximity effect extending into the superconductor.\n\nThe possibility of making heterostructures out of highTc cuprate superconductors and strong manganite ferromagnets like LSMO allow us to study the competition\nbetween superconducting and magnetic order where both\nare of equal strength. The magnanites are of special interest since they have the same perovskite structure as the\ncuprates and e.g. L0.67 Sr0.33 MnO3 is close to totally spin\npolarized i.e. a half metal[1]. We report initial results\nfrom an on-going study of the electron density of states\n(DoS) and the induced magnetism and superconductivity in half-metal/d-wave superconductor/half-metal trilayers. In particular we wish to identify properties that\nwould allow us to distinguish between a structure having\nthe two half-metals with parallel spin-bands from a one\nhaving them anti-parallel.\nThe study is based on quasiclassical Green's function\ntheory and the key issue is to pose the correct boundary\nconditions that connects a superconducting half-space\nwith a half-metallic one where only one spin-band is\npresent[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. In order to have coherent transport between a superconductor and a half-metal the interface needs to be spin-active, i.e. to reflect or transmit\nquasiparticles (and quasiholes) in a manner that depends\non the orientation of their spin relative to the magnetic\norientation that defines the spin-active interface. There\nare two different ways of spin-active scattering the interface may possess that we take into account: i) spinmixing or spin-rotation, the quasiparticle (quasihole) acquires a phase shift, \u00b1\u0398m /2, with the sign depending\nits spin orientation. The presence of spin-mixing introduces Andreev states in the DoS below the gap-energy \u2206\nand an (magnetic) exchange field in the superconductor\n[3, 4]. ii) spin-flip scattering, the half-metal allows trans-\n\nmission only of one spin orientation which leads to two\nchannels, with hopping amplitudes \u03c4\u2191\u2191 and \u03c4\u2193\u2191 , of spinscattering [6]. Through spin-flip scattering equal-spin superconducting correlations can be admitted into the halfmetal. These two ways of spin-activeness may be accounted for by the boundary conditions the quasiclassical\nGreens function must obey at the superconductor/halfmetal interface via the set of phenomenological parameters (\u0398m , \u03c4\u2191\u2191 , \u03c4\u2193\u2191 ) [6].\nThe geometry we study is that of two equal length\nhalf-metals, length LHM , that sandwich a d-wave superconductor, length LS . Both types of material are assumed\nto conduct in two-dimensional planes and the contact between them is made between these planes. Furthermore\nwe consider either that the two half-metals are parallel,\nboth conduct in the same spin band, or they are antiparallel and conduct in opposite spin bands. The sizes\nof the systems are taken to be on the order of 10 \u03be0\n(= h\u0304v f /2\u03c0 kBTc , the coherence length of the superconductor) and we assume clean materials so that impurity\nscattering may be neglected. Finally, since we consider\na d-wave superconductor the ab-plane of the superconductor may be oriented with respect to the interface normal. 5A It is well known that the d-wave superconductor admits zero-energy bound states (ZEBS) in the DoS\nif the ab-plane is not aligned to the interface [7]. These\nZEBS will be shifted from zero energy by a finite spinmixing scattering and the DoS of the 45o -degree rotated\n(or [110]) d-wave turns out to be very sensitive to weak\nspin-mixing.\nIn Figure 1 we display the orderparameter profile in\nthe d-wave superconductor, the triplet pairing correlations (TPC) both in the superconductor and in the half-\n\n\f\u2206(x)\n\n1.0\n\nN(\u03b5)\n\n()\n\n4\n3\n\n0.1\n\nNHM(\u03b5)\nNS,interface(\u03b5)\nNS,center(\u03b5)\n\n0.0\n\n4\n\n< sin\u03c6 fx>\n-5\n\n0\n\nx/\u03beo\n\n5\n\n10\n\n0.1\n\n2\n\n0.0\n\n1\n\n-0.1\n\n0\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n\u03b5/\u22060\n\n1\n\n2\n\n0.0\n\n\u03c4 =0.3/\u03c0\n\n3\n\n-0.5\n-10\n\n0.1\n\nvz,x(x)/\u22060\n\n0\n\n0.0\n\n\u03c4 =0.5/\u03c0\n\n-0.1\n\n1\n\n< sin\u03c6 fz>\n\n[110] d-wave SC\n\n2\n\n0.5\n\nN(\u03b5)\n\n\u2206(x)/ \u22060 and T\u03a3n<sin \u03c6 fz,x(x,\u03c6)>\u03c6\n\n5\n\n[110] d-wave SC\n\n-5\n\n-0.1\n\nvz(x)\n\u03c4 =0.1/\u03c0\n-3\n\n-1\n\n1\n\nvx(x)\n3\n\nx/\u03beo\n\n5\n\nFIGURE 1. To the left we plot the amplitude of the d-wave orderparameter as well as the triplet pairing correlations (TPC).\nThe TPC arise from the (repeated) scattering off the spin-active interfaces and they are also induced as equal-spin TPC\n(T \u2211n hsin \u03c6 fx (x, \u03c6 ; \u03b5n )i) in the half-metal. The interface parameters are [\u0398m = \u03c04 , \u03c4\u2191\u2191 = 0.1\n\u03c0 , \u03c4\u2193\u2191 = 0.9 \u03c4\u2191\u2191 ] which corresponds to\na low-transmission interface that is strongly spin-active. The full lines correspond to parallel alignment of the conduction bands of\nthe two half-metals and dashed lines to anti-parallel alignment. In the center we show the total density of states (DoS) both in the\nhalf-metal and in the superconductor. For the superconductor we show the DoS at the interface and in the center (x=0). Finally to\nthe right we show the induced exchange field in the superconductor for three values of transparency of the interface. Exchange fields\n\u03bdx,z are calculated assuming a Fermi-liquid parameter Aa0 = \u22120.7. The full (dashed) lines corresponds to (anti-)parallel half-metal\nalignment.\n\nmetal, and the angle averaged (total) DoS at various locations in our structure for a representative set of parameters. The temperature is set to 0.1Tc . In addition\nto finite size effects, the orderparameter is strongly suppressed in the vicinity of the interface due to the sign nature of d-wave pairing function. However, its magnitude\nat the interfaces is slightly enhanced by the spin-mixing\nscattering compared to that of a d-wave superconductor\nat a spin-inactive interface. The spin-mixing scattering\ngenerates Sz = 0 TPC ( fz ) in the superconductor while\nspin-flip scattering induces equal-spin Sz = \u00b11 TPC both\nin half-metal and in the superconductor ( fx ). Although\nparallel or anti-parallel alignment hardly makes a difference on the magnitude of the orderparameter, the TPC\nin parallel and anti-parallel alignments shows symmetric or antisymmetric behavior with respect to the center,\nrespectively. For more transparent interfaces the equalspin TPC grow stronger and gives rise to an exchange\nfield which direction-axis rotates in the superconductor.\nTypical magnitude for the exchange fields is \u223c 10% of\n\u22060 at the interface and decaying into the center of the\nsuperconductor. Note also that for the [110]-crystal the\nexchange field has the opposite symmetry with regard\nto the center-point compared to the TPC. For the [100]crystal these symmetries are the same and the TPC have\na cos \u03c6 p-wave basis function compared to the sin \u03c6 for\nthe [110]-crystal.\nTo investigate the alignment effects further, we show\nthe DoS for both cases in the center panel of Figure 1.\nFor both half-metal alignments, the ZEBS split in to two\npeaks in the DoS on the superconductor side owing to the\nspin-mixing scattering[4]. There is also a change in the\nDoS in the half-metal sides via the proximity effect. This\n\nis due to the spin-flip scattering. We find the alignment\ndifference clearly manifested in the DoS in superconductor side. In contrast to the sharp peaks in the DoS the antiparallel alignment shows, the bound-states peaks in parallel alignment are broadened or even split by finite size\neffects. This difference is due to that interference of repeated spin-mixing scattering of the bound states in parallel alignment is constructive and hence a split boundstate signature DoS. For the anti-parallel alignment this\nconstructive interference is canceled due to that consecutive scattering picks up opposite phase kicks at either\ninterface.\nWe gratefully acknowledge financial support from\n\"Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research\" from the MEXT\nof Japan (N.Y) and the Swedish Research Council (M.F).\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
