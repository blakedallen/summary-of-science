Nuclear reactions, nucleosynthesis, abundances \u2013 Stars: abundances \u2013 Galaxy: abundances\n\n1. Introduction\nThe neutron capture is the main mechanism to form elements\nheavier than iron. The other mechanism, the p-process, is required for the proton rich isotopes, whose abundances in the\nsolar system is less than 1%. Two major neutron capture mechanisms are generally invoked: the slow process (s-process) and\nthe rapid process (r-process), where the slow and rapid are defined relatively to the timescale of \u03b2-decay.\nThe s-process requires a relatively low neutron density and\nmoves along the valley of \u03b2 stability. The s-process feeds in\nparticular the elements Sr-Y-Zr, Ba-La-Ce-Pr-Nd and Pb, the\nthree major abundance s-peaks. The reason for the existence\nof these peaks is the following: the neutron capture process\nimposes certain features on the \"spectrum\" of the heavy element abundances. For certain neutron numbers N = 50, 82,\n126 the neutron capture cross-sections are much smaller than\nfor neighbouring neutron numbers. This means that once one of\nthese \"magic\" numbers is reached, it becomes significantly less\n\u22c6\n\nemail to: cescutti@ts.astro.it\n\nlikely for the nucleus to capture more neutrons. These numbers\nare a quantum mechanical effect of closed shells, in precisely\nthe same way that closed electron shells produce high chemical stability in the noble gases. Therefore, if the neutron capture\nprocess operates in some environment for some finite length of\ntime and then shuts off, we expect a fair number of nuclei to be\n\"stuck\" at these \"magic\" numbers. Elements which correspond\nto these \"magic\" numbers of neutrons will thus be especially\nabundant. We identify then three peaks, as described above.\nThe site of production of the s-elements is not unique. In\nfact, the main component, accounting for the s-process in the\natomic mass number range 90 < A < 208, was shown to occur\nin the low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars during recurrent thermal pulses (Gallino et al. 1998; Busso et al. 1999).\nIn particular, they showed that the main s-component is due to\nlow metallicity ([Fe/H] < \u22121.5) low mass AGB stars (1.5-3.0\nM\u2299 ).\nThe s-process mechanism operating in the AGB model is dependent on the initial stellar metallicity. In fact, although the\n13\nC pocket, which acts as neutron producer, is of \"primary\n\n\f2\n\nG. Cescutti et al.: The chemical evolution of Barium and Europium in the Milky Way\n\norigin\" in the work of Gallino et al. (1998) and Busso et al.\n(1999, 2001), the ensuing s-process production is dependent on\nthe initial abundance of the Fe-group seeds, i.e. on the stellar\nmetallicity. The neutron exposure (the neutron flux per nuclei\nseed) is indeed roughly proportional to the number of available neutron sources (the 13 C nuclei) per seed (the iron nuclei),\nhence inversely proportional to the stellar metallicity.\nOn the other hand, the weak s-component is responsible\nfor the s-process nuclides up to A \u2243 90 and it is recognized as\nthe result of neutron capture in advanced evolution in massive\nstars(see Raiteri et al. 1993). Finally, the strong-s component\nwas introduced by Clayton & Rassbach (1967) in order to\nreproduce more than 50% of solar 208 Pb.\nThe r-process takes place in extremely neutron-rich environments in which the mean time between two successive neutron captures is very short, compared with the time necessary\nfor the \u03b2-decay. Several scenarios have been proposed for the\norigin of r-process elements: neutrino winds in core-collapse\nsupernovae (Woosley et al. 1994), the collapse of ONeMg cores\nresulting from stars with initial masses in the range 8-10M\u2299\n(Wanajo et al. 2003) and neutron star mergers (Freiburghaus et\nal. 1999), even if this last scenario seems to be ruled out from\nrecent work of Argast et al. (2004) at least as major responsible of r-process enrichment in our Galaxy. In any case, no clear\nconsensus has been achieved and r-process nucleosynthesis remains still uncertain and until now, as far as we know, theoretical prescriptions for the r-process production still do not\nexist with the exception of the results of Wanajo et al. (2003)\nand Woosley and Hoffmann (1992). However, the results of the\nmodel of Wanajo et al. cannot be used in galactic chemical evolution models because, they do not take into account the fallback (after the SN explosion some material can fall back to the\ncentral collapsing neutron star) and so the amount of neutron\ncapture elements produced is probably too high (about 2 order\nof magnitude higher than the chemical evolution predictions).\nFurthermore, Woosley and Hoffmann (1992) have given prescriptions for r-process only until 107 Ru. In order to shed light\non the nature (s- and/or r- processes) of heavy elements such\nas Ba and Eu one should examine the abundances of these elements in Galactic stars of all metallicities. These abundances\ncan, in fact, give us clues to interpret their nucleosynthetic origin. In the last few years a great deal of observational work for\ngalactic stars appeared: McWilliam et al. (1995), Ryan et al.\n(1996), Burris et al. (2000), Fulbright (2000), Mashonkina &\nGehren (2000, 2001), Koch & Edvardsson (2002), Honda et al.\n(2004), Ishimaru et al. (2004).\nOne striking aspect of the data relative to both Ba and Eu\nis the large spread observed in the [Ba/Fe] and [Eu/Fe] ratios\nin halo stars (e.g. Mc William et al.1995; Ryan et al.1996).\nAlthough this spread seems to be real, it is not found for the\n[\u03b1/Fe] ratios in very metal poor stars (down to [Fe/H] = \u22124.0,\nCayrel et al. 2004). This fact suggests that the spread, if real,\nis a characteristic of the nuclear capture elements and not only\ndue to an inhomogeneous mixing in the early halo phases, as\nsuggested by several authors (Tsujimoto et al. 1999; Ishimaru\n& Wanajo 1999).\n\nPrevious studies of the evolution of s- and r- process\nelements are from Mathews et al. (1992), Pagel & Tautvaisiene\n(1997), Travaglio et al. (1999). In the Mathews et al. (1992)\npaper it was suggested that the observed apparent decrease of\nthe abundance of Eu for [Fe/H] < \u22122.5 could be due to the fact\nthat Eu originates mainly in low mass core-collapse SNe (7-8\nM\u2299 ). Pagel & Tautvaisiene (1997) suggested that to reproduce\nthe observed behaviour of Ba it is necessary to assume that at\nearly stages Ba is produced as an r-process element by a not\nwell identified range of massive stars. A similar conclusion\nwas reached by Travaglio et al. (1999) who showed that\nthe evolution of Ba cannot be explained by assuming that\nthis element is only a s-process element mainly formed in\nstars with initial masses 2-4M\u2299 , but an r-process origin for it\nshould be considered. In fact, in the former hypothesis a very\nlate appearance of Ba should be expected, at variance with\nthe observations indicating that Ba was already produced at\n[Fe/H]=-4.0. They suggested that low mass SNII (from 8 to\n10M\u2299 ) could be responsible for the r-component of Ba. An\nattempt to explain the observed spread in s- and r-elements\ncan be found later in Tsujimoto et al. (1999) and Ishimaru\n& Wanajo (1999), who claim for an inefficient mixing in the\nearly galactic phases and attribute the spread to the fact that\nwe observe the pollution due to single supernovae. Ishimaru &\nWanajo (1999) also concluded that the Eu should originate as\nan r-process element in stars with masses in the range 8-10M\u2299.\nThis latter suggestion was confirmed by Ishimaru et al. (2004)\nby comparing model predictions with new data from Subaru\nindicating subsolar [Eu/Fe] ratios in three stars very metal\npoor ([Fe/H]< \u22123.0).\nIn this paper we present the results of a chemical evolution\nmodel, based on the original two-infall model of Chiappini et\nal. (1997) for the Milky Way in the latest version developed by\nChiappini et al. (2003) and adopted in Fran\u00e7ois et al. (2004).\nWe compare the predictions relative to the evolution of Ba\nand Eu with the newest data of Fran\u00e7ois et al. (2005). A spread,\nalthough lower than in previous data, still exists for [Ba/Fe] and\n[Eu/Fe] at low metallicities. We attempt to give an explanation\nof this spread without invoking only the inhomogeneous halo\nmixing.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in Sect. 2 we present the\nobservational data, in Sect. 3 the chemical evolution model is\npresented and in Sect. 4 the adopted nucleosynthesis prescriptions are described. In Sect. 5 we present the results and in Sect.\n6 some conclusions are drawn.\n\n2. Observational data\nIn this paper, we preferentially used the most recent available\ndata based on high quality spectra collected with efficient spectrographs and 8-10 m class telescopes. In particular, for the\nextremely metal poor stars ([Fe/H] between \u22124 and \u22123), we\nadopted the recent results from UVES Large Program \"First\nStar\" (Cayrel et al. 2004, Fran\u00e7ois et al. 2005). This sample\nis made of 31 extremely metal-poor halo stars selected in the\nHK survey (Beers et al. 1992, 1999). We can deduce from the\nkinematics of these stars that they were born at very different\n\n\fG. Cescutti et al.: The chemical evolution of Barium and Europium in the Milky Way\n\nplaces in the Galactic halo. This overcomes the possibility of\na selection bias. The analysis is made in a systematic and homogeneous way, from very high quality data, giving abundance\nratios of unprecedented accuracy in this metallicity range. For\nthe abundances in the remaining range of [Fe/H], we took published high quality data in the literature from various sources:\nBurris et al. (2000), Fulbright (2000), Mashonkina & Gehren\n(2000, 2001), Koch & Edvardsson (2002), Honda et al. (2004),\nIshimaru et al. (2004). All of this data are relative to solar abundances of Grevesse & Sauval (1998).\n\nWe model the formation of the Galaxy assuming two main infall episodes: the first forms the halo and the thick disk, the\nsecond the thin disk. The timescale for the formation of the\nhalo-thick disk is \u223c 1Gyr. The timescale for the thin disk is\nmuch longer, implying that the infalling gas forming the thin\ndisk comes mainly from the intergalactic medium and not only\nfrom the halo (Chiappini et al. 1997). Moreover, the formation\nof the thin disk is assumed to be function of the galactocentric\ndistance, leading to an inside out scenario for the Galaxy disk\nbuilt up (Matteucci & Fran\u00e7ois 1989). The main characteristic\nof the two-infall model is an almost independent evolution between the halo and the thin disk (see also Pagel & Tautvaisienne\n1995). A threshold in the star formation process (Kennicutt\n1989, 1998, Martin & Kennicutt 2001) is also adopted. The\nmodel well reproduces an extended set of observational constraints both for the solar neighborhood and for the whole disc.\nOne of the most important observational constraints is represented by the various relations between the abundances of metals (C,N,O,\u03b1-elements, iron peak elements) as functions of the\n[Fe/H] abundance (see Chiappini et al. 2003). The equation below describes the time evolution of Gi , namely the mass fraction of the element i in the gas:\n\u0120i (t) = \u2212\u03c8(r, t)Xi (r, t)\n\n+\n\nML\n\n+A\n\nMBm\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee 0.5\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8efZ\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\u03c6(MB ) * \uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef f (\u03bc)\u03c8(t \u2212 \u03c4m2 )QSmiNIa (t \u2212 \u03c4m2 )d\u03bc\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa dMB\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f0\n\n+(1 \u2212 A)\n\n\u03bcm\n\nMBM\nZ\n\n\u03c8(t \u2212 \u03c4m )Qmi (t \u2212 \u03c4m )\u03c6(m)dm\n\nMBm\n\n+\n\nZMU\n\n\u03c8(t \u2212 \u03c4m )Qmi (t \u2212 \u03c4m )\u03c6(m)dm\n\nMBM\n\n+ XAi A(r, t)\n\n8\n\n6\n\n2\n\n0\n0\n\n(1)\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nFig. 1. The SFR expressed in M\u2299 pc\u22122Gyr\u22121 as predicted by\nthe two infall model. The gap in the SFR at the end of the halothick disc phase is evident. The oscillations are due to the fact\nthat at the late times in the galactic disc the surface gas density\nis always close to the threshold density.\n\nwhere Xi (r, t) is the abundance by mass of the element i and Qmi\nindicates the fraction of mass restored by star of mass m in form\nof the element i, the so-called \"production matrix\" as originally\ndefined by Talbot and Arnett (1973). We indicate with ML the\nlightest mass which contributes to the chemical enrichment and\nit is set at 0.8M\u2299 ; the upper mass limit, MU , is set at 100M\u2299 .\nThe star formation rate (SFR) \u03c8(r, t) is defined:\n\u03a3(r, t)\n\u03c8(r, t) = \u03bd\n\u03a3(r\u2299 , t)\n\n\u03c8(t \u2212 \u03c4m )Qmi (t \u2212 \u03c4m )\u03c6(m)dm\n\nMBM\nZ\n\n10\n\n4\n\n3.

The gas surface exponent, k, is\nset equal to 1.5. With these values for the parameters the observational constraints, in particular in the solar vicinity, are\nwell fitted. Below a critical threshold of the gas surface density\n(7M\u2299 pc\u22122 ) we assume no star formation. This naturally produces a hiatus in the SFR between the halo-thick disk phase\nand the thin disk phase. In Fig. (1) is shown the predicted star\nformation rate for the halo-thick disc phase and the thin disc\nphase, respectively.\n\n\f4\n\nG. Cescutti et al.: The chemical evolution of Barium and Europium in the Milky Way\n\nFor \u03c6, the initial mass function (IMF), we use the Scalo\n(1986), constant in time and space. \u03c4m is the evolutionary lifetime of stars as a function of their mass \"m\".\nThe SNeIa rate has been computed following\nGreggio & Renzini (1983) and Matteucci & Greggio (1986)\nand it is expressed as:\nRS NeIa = A\n\nMBM\nZ\n\n\u03c6(MB )(\n\nMBm\n\nZ0.5\n\nf (\u03bc)\u03c8(t \u2212 \u03c4 M2 )d\u03bc)dMB\n\n4\n\n3\n\n(3)\n\n\u03bcm\n\n2\n\nwhere M2 is the mass of the secondary, MB is the total mass of the binary system, \u03bc = M2 /MB , \u03bcm =\nmax [M(t)2 /MB , (MB \u2212 0.5MBM )/MB ], MBm = 3M\u2299 , MBM =\n16M\u2299 . The IMF is represented by \u03c6(MB ) and refers to the total mass of the binary sistem for the computation of the SNeIa\nrate, f (\u03bc) is the distribution function for the mass fraction of\nthe secondary:\n\n1\n\nf (\u03bc) = 21+\u03b3 (1 + \u03b3)\u03bc\u03b3\n\n0\n\n(4)\n\nwith \u03b3 = 2; A is the fraction of systems in the appropriate\nmass range, which can give rise to SNeIa events. This quantity\nis fixed to 0.05 by reproducing the observed SNeIa rate at the\npresent time (Cappellaro et al. 1999). Note that in the case of\nSNIa the\"production matrix\" is indicated with QSmiNIa because\nof its different nucleosynthesis contribution (for details refer to\nMatteucci and Greggio 1986). In Fig. 2 we show the predicted\ntype II and Ia SN rates. The type II SN rate follows the SFR, as\nexpected, whereas the type Ia SN rate does not have this feature\ndue to the nature of type Ia SN progenitors, which are assumed\nto be low-intermediate mass star with a long evolutionary time\nscales.\nThe last term in equation 1 represents the accretion and it\nis defined as:\nA(r, t) = a(r)e\u2212t/\u03c4H + b(r)e(t\u2212tmax )/\u03c4D (r)\n\n(5)\n\nXAi are the abundances of infalling material, assumed primordial, tmax = 1Gyr is the time for the maximum infall rate on\nthe thin disk, \u03c4H = 2.0Gyr is the time scale for the formation\nof the halo thick-disk and \u03c4D is the timescale of the thin disk,\nfunction of the galactocentric distance:\n\u03c4D = 1.033r(kpc) \u2212 1.267Gyr\n\n(6)\n\nThe coefficients a(r) and b(r) are constrained by the present\nday total surface mass density as a function of galactocentric\ndistance. In particular, b(r) is assumed to be different from zero\nonly for t > tmax , where tmax is the time of maximum infall on\nthe thin disc (see Chiappini et al. 2003, for details).\n\n4. Nucleosynthesis Prescriptions\n\n4.1. S-process\nWe have adopted the yields of Busso et al. (2001) in the\nmass range 1.5-3M\u2299 for the s-main component. In this process, the dependence on the metallicity is very important. In\nfact, the s-process elements are made by accretion of neutrons\non seed elements (in particular iron) already present in the\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nFig. 2. Predicted SN II (continuous line) and Ia (dashed line)\nrates by the two infall model.\n\nstar. Therefore, this Ba component behaves like a secondary\nelement. The neutron flux is due to the reaction 13C(\u03b1, n)16 O\nwhich can easily be activated at the low temperature of these\nstars (see Busso et al. 1999). The yields are shown in Table\n1 and Fig. 3 as functions of the initial metallicity of the stars.\nThe theoretical results by Busso et al. (2001) suggest negligible Europium production in the s-process and therefore we neglected this component in our work. We have added for models\n1 and 2 (see table 2) an extension to the theoretical result of\nBusso et al. (2001) in the mass range 1 \u2212 1.5M\u2299 by simply\nscaling with the mass the values obtained for stars of 1.5M\u2299 .\nWe have extended the prescription in order to better fit the data\nwith a [Fe/H] supersolar and it does not change the results of\nthe model at [Fe/H] < 0.\n\n4.2. R-process\nAs already said in the introduction the production of r-process\nelements is still a challenge for astrophysics and even for nuclear physics, due to the fact that the nuclear properties of thousand of nuclei located between the valley of \u03b2 stability and the\nneutron drip line, necessary to correctly compute this process,\nare ignored. In our models we have tested 6 different nucleosynthesis prescriptions for the r-process Ba and Eu, as shown\nin tables 2, 3 and 4. Some of the prescriptions refer to models by Travaglio et al. (2001) (model 3) and Ishimaru et al.\n(2004)(models 4, 5 and 6), whereas the others contain yields\nchosen rather \"ad hoc\".\nIn the case of Ba we have included an r-process component,\nproduced in massive stars in the range 12-30M\u2299 in model 1\nand in the range 10-25M\u2299 in model 2.

In fact, the first stars, which produce s-processed\nBa (see Sect. 4.1), have a mass of 3M\u2299 and they start to enrich\nthe ISM only at [Fe/H] \u2265 \u22122.\nWe stress that Travaglio et al. (2001) predicted r-process\nBa only from stars in the range 8-10M\u2299 , but their conclusions\nwere based upon an older set of observational data.\nMoreover, we considered another independent indication\nfor the r-process production of Barium; Mazzali and Chugai\n(1995) observed Ba lines in SN 1987A, which had a progenitor star of 20M\u2299 . These lines of Ba are well reproduced with\na overabundance factor f = Xobs /Xi = 5 (typical metal abundance for LMC Xi = (1/2.75)\u00d7 solar). From this observational\nnew\ndata we can derive a XBa\n\u223c 2 * 10\u22128 , which is in agreement\nwith our prescriptions.\nFor the Eu we assumed that it is completely due to the rprocess and that the yields originate from massive stars in the\nrange 12-30M\u2299 in model 1 and 10-25M\u2299 in model 2, as shown\nin table 2.\nIn particular, our choice is done with the purpose of best fitting the plots [Ba/Fe] vs.[Fe/H], [Eu/Fe] vs.[Fe/H] and [Ba/Eu]\nvs [Fe/H] as well as the Ba and Eu solar abundance (taking in\naccount the contribution of the low-intermediate mass star in\ncase of the Ba).\nWe have tested prescriptions for Ba and Eu both for a primary production and a secondary production (with a depen-\n\n0\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\n\nnew\nFig. 3.

In the first case the main feature of\nthe yields is a big enhancement in the mass range 12 \u2212 15M\u2299\n(model 1) with no dependence on the metallicity and so the\nelements are considered as primary elements. In the case of\nmetallicity dependence (model 2), the yield behaviour is chosen to have a strong enhancement in the range of metallicity\n5 * 10\u22127 < Z < 1 * 10\u22125 with almost constant yield for Eu and\nBa in the whole mass range for a given metallicity.\n\n4.3. Iron\nFor the nucleosynthesis prescriptions of the Fe, we adopted\nthose suggested in Fran\u00e7ois et al. (2004), in particular we\nconsidered the yields of Woosley & Weaver (1995) (hereafter\nWW95) for a solar chemical composition. We remind that the\nyields suggested for several elements by Fran\u00e7ois et al.

Trends\nIn this Sect. we investigate how the different models fit the\nthe trends of the abundances ratios for [Ba/Fe], [Eu/Fe] and\n[Ba/Eu] versus [Fe/H] and even for [Ba/Eu] versus [Ba/H].\nTo better investigate the trends of the data we have decided\nto divide in several bins the [Fe/H] axis and the [Ba/H] axis and\ncompute the mean and the standard deviation from the mean of\nthe ratios [Ba/Fe], [Eu/Fe] and [Ba/Eu] for all the data inside\neach bin.\n\n\f6\n\nG.

(1999). In fact, we want\nto underline that we are using a different chemical evolution\nmodel and this gives rise to different results. The main difference between the two chemical evolution models (the one of\nTravaglio and the present one) consists in the age-[Fe/H] relation which grows more slowly in the model of Travaglio. The\ncause for this difference is probably due to the different adopted\nstellar lifetimes, to the different Mup (i.e. the mass of the most\nmassive star ending its life as C-O white dwarf) and to the yield\nprescriptions for the iron which are probably the WW95 metallicity dependent ones in the model of Travaglio et al.(1999),\nwhereas we use the WW95 yields for the solar chemical compositios, which produce faster rise of Iron.\n\nWe have divided in a different way the [Fe/H] for [Ba/Fe]\nratio and the [Fe/H] for [Eu/Fe] and [Ba/Eu] ratios because the\n[Eu/Fe] ratio for 12 stars at very low metallicity is only an upper limit and therefore the data of these stars have not been\nconsidered in the computation of the mean and the standard\ndeviation for [Eu/Fe] and [Ba/Eu] ratios.\nIn the case of [Ba/Eu] and [Eu/Fe] we have simply divided\nthe [Fe/H] axis in 15 bins of equal dimension (see table 6);\nfor [Ba/Fe] we have divided in 18 bins the [Fe/H] but we have\nmerged the first three bins (starting from the lowest value in\n[Fe/H]) in a single bin in order to have enough data in the first\nbin (see table 5).

In these models\nthe upper mass limit for the production of the r-processed Ba is\n30M\u2299 in the case of model 1, and 25M\u2299 in the case of model 2.\nHowever, the model 2 does not fit as well as model 1 the trend\nof the data but we would like to stress that the prescriptions of\nmodel 2 are very simplistic. In fact, there is no dependence on\nmass for a given metallicity in the yields of Ba and Eu. This\nprescription is clearly an oversimplification but our goal is to\nshow how a model with yields only dependent on metallicity\nworks and so we are able to better understand at least roughly\nif it could be a good approach or not.\nWe have obtained similar results comparing the trend of the\nabundance of [Eu/Fe] versus [Fe/H] with the three models of\nIshimaru et al.(2004) (model 4, 5 and 6 in table 2).

Again neither model 4 explains the low metallicity\nabundances nor model 5 and 6 well fit the trend of the data. In\nFig. 8 we show the results of the models 1 and 2 in this case for\n[Eu/Fe] versus [Fe/H]. The trend of the data is well followed\nby both models from low metallicity to the solar metallicity.\nIn table 8 we show the predicted solar abundances of Eu\nand Ba for all our models compared to the solar abundances\nby Grevesse & Sauval (1998). We have put in the table also\nthe predicted s-process fraction in the Barium solar abundance.\nThe results of almost all our models are in good agreement\nwith the solar abundances with the exception of model 5 which\nunderpredicts the Eu abundance by a factor of nearly 2. Note\nthat we predict a slightly different s-process fraction (nearly\n60% instead of 80%) compared with the s-process fraction obtained by previous authors (Travaglio et al. 1999, Arlandini et\nal. 1999, Raiteri et al. 1992 and K\u00e4ppeler et al. 1989).

In this Fig we show the ratio between the newly produced Ba and Fe as a function of the stellar mass for the model\n1 yields (solid line); the same for Eu in long dashed line.\n\nSince we have a mean value for [Ba/Eu] versus [Fe/H] in\nthe range \u22123 < [Fe/H] < \u22121 of -0.44 (taken from the mean\nvalue in the bins which fall in that range) and a similar value\nfor [Ba/Eu] versus [Ba/H] in the range \u22124 < [Ba/H] < \u22120.8\nof -0.41 (computed in the same way as above), then it turns out\nthat the s-process fraction for Barium slow processed has to be\nless than the claimed 80% with a value of \u223c 60%.\nFinally, we want to say that the spread in the ratio of\n[Ba/Eu] both versus [Fe/H] and [Ba/H] is lower than the spread\nin [Ba/Fe] and [Eu/Fe], in particular when using as evolutionary tracer the [Ba/H].\nIn fact, considering the computed standard deviations as\nspread tracers, where the spread for [Ba/Fe] and [Eu/Fe] is\nhigher ([Fe/H] \u223c \u22123), their standard deviations are greater\nthan 0.6 dex whereas the standard deviations for [Ba/Eu] is less\nthan 0.15 dex.\nFor this reason we believe that the mechanism which produces the observational spread does not affect the ratio of these\ntwo elements. In our picture the explanation of the smaller\nspread in the ratio of [Ba/Eu] is that the site of production of\nthese two elements is the same, the neutronized shell close to\nthe mass cut in a SNII (see Woosley et al. 1994). What changes\ncould be the amount of the neutronized material which each\nmassive star expells during the SNII explosion. In fact, the\nmass cut and also the ejected neutronized material, are still uncertain quantities and usually they are considered as parameters\n\n5.2. Comparison with inhomogeneus chemical\nevolution models\n\nin the nucleosynthesis codes for massive stars (see Rauscher et\nal. 2002, Woosley & Weaver 1995, Woosley et al. 1994).\n\nOur chemical evolution model is a model where instantaneous\nmixing is assumed, (ie. shorter than the timestep of integration\nof the equations), therefore it is only able to follow the general\ntrends of the abundance ratios as a function of [Fe/H] found in\nthe metal-poor stars. Inhomogeneous models assume that supernovae are able to pollute a small region of gas surrounding\nthem, and depending on the mass of the supernova (hence the\nyields) and the size of the polluted zone, an abundance spread\nis predicted. An important point is that the abundance ratios do\nnot change with the amount of gas which is polluted by the supernova. It is therefore interesting to look at the range of the\nabundance ratios log(Ba/Fe) that we obtain with our model and\ncompare them with the spread found in the observations.\nIn figure 11 we show the ratio between the r-process elements production and iron production as a function of stellar\nmass in the range 12 \u2212 30M\u2299 . This means that the maximum\nspread which could be found with any inhomogeneous model\nof chemical evolution is shown by the range of abundance ratios displayed in figure 11 i.e. about 2 dex.\nThe observational data instead are varying in a range which\nis of the order of 3 dex (see the data in figures 12 for Ba and\n13 for Eu). Therefore, even using an inhomogeneous model\nwith our best model yields it would not explain the spread of\nthe data. However, by adjusting the production of Ba and Eu\n\n\fG. Cescutti et al.: The chemical evolution of Barium and Europium in the Milky Way\n\nonly in a very narrow interval near 10 M\u2299 , one can account\nfor the observed spread. This adjustment may even be justified\nbecause SNe of 10 M\u2299 result in O/Mg/Ne core collapse and\nmake very little Fe, but r-process elements could be produced\nin the ejecta from the neutron star. A similar approach has been\nused by the inhomogeneous model of Argast et al. (2004) and\nby Ishimaru et al. (2004).\nFrom the results obtained in this work, it is not possible\nto reproduce, even with an inhomogeneous chemical history,\nsuch a large spread in the data. It is possible that this discrepancy might be due to the existence of another parameter besides the initial mass determining the SN II yields, such as\nperhaps the initial angular momentum. In the following section, we explore, under the assumption that the same massive\nstars contribute both to Fe and r-process synthesis, i.e. without\nany decoupling, which yield ratios a supernova should produce\nto explain both the very high and the very low [r-process/Fe]\nfound in the sample of observed halo stars.\n\n11\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n5.3. Upper and lower limit to the r-process production\nThe purpose of this Sect. is to give upper and lower limits to\nthe yields in order to reproduce the observed spread at low\nmetallicities for Ba and Eu. We are well aware that an inhomogeneous model would provide better predictions about the\ndispersion in the [r-process/Fe] ratios if due to yield variations,\nbut we also believe that it is still useful to study the effect of\nthe yield variations by means of our model.\nFirst we explore the range of variations of the yields as\nfunctions of the stellar mass. To do this we have worked on\nthe model 1: in particular, we have modified the yields of the\nmodel 1 for both elements (Ba and Eu), leaving untouched the\ns-process yields and changing only the yields of the r-process.\n1Max and 1min and their characteristics are summarized in\nthe table 9.\nIn Fig. 12 and 13 we plot ratios [Ba/Fe] vs [Fe/H] and\n[Eu/Fe] vs [Fe/H] respectively, for the new models 1Max 1min\nand 1 compared to the observational data; we show the same\nplot for the ratios [Ba/Eu] vs [Fe/H] in Fig.14 and and for\n[Ba/Eu] versus [Ba/H] in Fig. 15.\nWe can deduce from these upper and lower limit models\nthat the large observed spread could be also due to a different\nproduction of heavy elements among massive stars (> 15M\u2299 ).\nThis type of stars could produce different amounts of these elements independently of the mass. As we have introduced in the\nprevious subsect. (5.1), it is possible to link this fact with the\nproblems of mass cut and the fall back during the explosion of\na SNII. If these elements are produced in a shell close to the\niron core of the star, differences in the explosion behaviour can\ngive rise to a different quantity of r-process elements expelled\nby the star.\nIn this way we are able to explain the presence of the spread\nfor the heavy elements and the absence of the same spread for\nexample in the \u03b1-elements. In fact, the \u03b1-elements are produced\nmostly during the hydrostatic burning of massive stars and then\nejected by the explosion.\n\nFig. 12. In this Fig. we show the ratio [Ba/Fe] versus [Fe/H]\nfor the data by Fran\u00e7ois et al. (2005) (filled squares) and for\nthe other observational data (see Sect. 2 in the text, the filled\ncircles). The solid line is the prediction of model 1, the short\ndashed line the prediction of model 1Max and the long dashed\nline the prediction of model 1min.\n\nAnother approach can be followed to derive again upper\nand lower limit for the model by changing the yields as functions of metallicity. The model 2, which is the model with\nyields independent of the mass and depending only on metallicity, will be our test model. In particular, Model 2 assumes for\nthe massive stars different yields for Ba and Eu in three ranges\nof metallicity (see table 2).\nThe new prescriptions for both Ba and Eu are summarized\nin table 10.\nIn Fig. 16 and 17 are shown the results of these two models\n(2Max and 2min) and of the original model 2 for [Ba/Fe] vs\n[Fe/H] and for [Eu/Fe] versus [Fe/H] respectively, compared to\nthe observational data.\nThe results are very interesting. In fact, changing the central\nrange of metallicity, in which there is an enhancement of the\nproduction of Ba and Eu, it is possible to produce the upper and\nthe lower limits. These two new models envelope the majority\nof the data at low metallicities. At higher metallicity the two\nmodels overlap the best model and so they do not contain all\nthe spread in this part of the plot but most of them could be\nexplained inside the typical observational error of 0.1 dex.\n\n6. Conclusions\nThe main goal of this work was to follow the evolution of Ba\nand Eu by means of a chemical evolution model well reproducing the abundance trends for other elements.

(1997) model in its latest version as\ndescribed in Chiappini et al. (2003). To reach this goal we have\nused empirical yields for stars with mass > 8M\u2299 , producing\nr-process elements. In fact for the r-process elements there are\nnot solid theoretical yields, since the mechanism which is involved in their production, the so called r-process, is still not\nwell understood. We conclude that Ba needs two components:\na s-process main component originating in low mass stars plus\na r-component originating in stars in the range 10-30M\u2299. This\nrange is different from the one suggested by Travaglio et al.\n(1999) and is obtained by requiring the best fit of the new data.\nFor Eu we estimated that it is mainly produced by an r-process\nand that stars in the same mass range 10-30M\u2299 should be considered as the progenitors of this element.\nThe nearly constant value of the ratio [Ba/Eu] produced in\nmassive stars by the r-process, can be used to estimate the fraction of Barium in the solar abundance produced by the slow\nprocess. We have obtained in this way a fraction that is different from the previous results: 60% instead of 80%.\nWe found that the yields ratios which we obtained to reproduce the trends are not able to explain the large spread found by\nthe observations even with the use of an inhomogeneous model.\nThis implies or the decoupling of the production r-process ele-\n\nnew\nX Ba\n10 \u2212 25M\u2299\n1.00*10\u22128\n1.00*10\u22126\n1.60*10\u22127\n\nnew\nXEu\n10 \u2212 25M\u2299\n5.00*10\u221210\n5.00*10\u22128\n8.00*10\u22129\n\nments and Fe or a variation of the yields as a function of metallicity for example.
