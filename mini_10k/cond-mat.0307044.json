Thereby, a change of electron density does\nnot change the Hall conductance [2\u20134]. The localization\nlength in tails of Landau bands is very small,\u221aof the order of the cyclotron length lcyc = vF /\u03c9B = 2n + 1lB .\nIt increases towards the centers of the Landau bands,\nEn0 = h\u0304\u03c9B (n + 1/2) (n = 0, 1, 2, ...), with \u03c9B = eB/m\u2217\nthe cyclotron frequency (e elementary charge, m\u2217 effec2\ntive mass), vF the Fermi velocity, and lB\n= h\u0304/eB defines the magnetic length. In an infinite 2DES in perpendicular magnetic field, the localization length at energy E diverges as \u03be \u223c |E \u2212 En0 |\u2212\u03bd , reminiscent of\n2nd order phase transitions. The critical exponent \u03bd\nis found numerically for the lowest two Landau bands,\nn = 0, 1, to be \u03bd = 2.33 \u00b1 0.04 for spin-split Landau\nlevels [5,6]. Analytical [7] and experimental studies [8]\nare consistent with this value. In a finite 2DES, a region\nof extended states should exist in the centers of disorder\nbroadened Landau-bands. These states extend beyond\nthe system size L. The width of these regions is given\nby \u2206E = (lcyc /L)1/\u03bd \u0393, where \u0393 = h\u0304(2\u03c9B /\u03c0\u03c4 )1/2 is the\nband width, with elastic scattering time \u03c4 .\nIn quantum Hall bars of finite width, there exist in addition edge states with energies lifted by the confinement\npotential above the energies of centers of bulk Landau\nbands, En0 [4]. Previously, there has been a considerable interest in the study of mesoscopically narrow quantum Hall bars [9], with emphasis on conductance fluctuations [10,11], edge state mixing [12\u201315], breakdown of\nthe quantum Hall effect [16], and quenching of the Hall\neffect due to classical commensurability effects [17]. It is\nknown that in the presence of white noise disorder the\nedge states do mix with the bulk states when the Fermi\nenergy is moved into the center of a Landau band. It\nhad been suggested that this might result in localization of edge states [14,15]. In this paper, we show that\n\nthis is indeed the case. In particular, at zero temperature the two-terminal conductance of a quantum wire\nin a magnetic field exhibit for uncorrelated disorder and\nhard wall confinement discontinuous transitions between\ninteger plateau values and zero, Fig 1.\n10.00\n9.00\n8.00\n500\n\n7.00\n\nG\n\n6.00\n\n\u03be\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0307044v3 [cond-mat.mes-hall] 1 Jun 2004\n\n1\n\n5.00\n4.00\n3.00\n2.00\n1.00\n0.00\n\n0\n-5.00\n\n-4.00\n\n-3.00\n\n-2.00\n\n-1.00\n\n0.00\n\nE\nFIG. 1.

For stronger magnetic fields, b > 1,\nl0 crosses over to the cyclotron length lcyc . g exhibits\nShubnikov-de-Haas oscillations as function of magnetic\nfield for b > 1. Maxima occur when the Fermi energy\nis in the center of Landau bands. Thus, the localization\nlength increases strongly from band tails to band centers,\neven when the wire width Ly is too narrow to allow delocalisation of bulk states. For uncorrelated impurities,\nwithin self consistent Born approximation [25], the maxima are given by g(E = En0 ) = (2n + 1)/\u03c0 = gn . Thus,\n\u03be2D (En0 ) = lcyc exp (\u03c0 2 gn2 ) are macroscopically large in\ncenters of higher Landau bands, n > 1 [6,26]. However,\nwhen the width of the system Ly is smaller than \u03be2D , localization is expected to behave quasi-1D. In other words,\nelectrons in centers of Landau bands can diffuse between\nthe edges of the system, but are localized parallel to the\nedges if Ly < \u03be2D . The quasi-1D localization length is\nknown to depend only linearly on g.

The result of transfer matrix calculations is\nplotted (dot size: numerical error \u2248 1%) for periodic boundary conditions [31] as function of magnetic flux through unit\n2\ncell x = a2 /2\u03c0lB\n. Dimensionless conductance parameter per\nspin channel is g(B = 0) = 5.1. At weak magnetic fields doubling of \u03be due to breaking of time reversal symmetry is seen,\nin good agreement with the analytical crossover formula (full\nline) [30,32]. Horizontal dashed line: Ly = 30a.\n\n(2)\n\nThere is a crossover from 2D to 1D localization as the\nFermi energy is moved from tails to centers of Landau\nbands. Performing a renormalization of the wire conductance, one obtains for the localization length [30],\n2\n\n300\n\n(3)\n\nIf all states in centers of higher Landau bands are localized along the wire, the question arises if there exist\nextended states in the quantum Hall wire at all. Consider\nan annulus, with a circumference larger than the localization length in the center of a Landau band. When a\nmagnetic flux pierces the annulus, localized states are unaffected. Guiding centers of states which extend around\nthe annulus do shift in position and energy, however [4].\nIn a confined wire there exist chiral edge states , which extend around the annulus. A magnetic flux change moves\nthese states down and up inner and outer edges, respectively. As shown above, in the middle of the Landau\nband, the electrons can diffuse freely from edge to edge,\nbut are localized along the annulus with \u03be > Ly . As a\nconsequence, when adiabatically changing the magnetic\nflux, an \"edge state\" has to move from the inner to the\nouter edge, since it cannot enter the band of localized\nstates. This fact has been interpreted as proof for the\nexistence of an extended bulk state, extending around\nthe annulus and between edges, at the energy Em , with\n\u03be(Em ) = Ly [4]. In the following, we show that rather\na transition from extended chiral edge states to localised\nstates occurs at these energies, Em .\nUsing the transfer matrix method [24], we have calculated the localization length as function of energy E\nin a tight binding model of a disordered quantum wire\n\nIts solution shows a crossover between the quasi-1-D\u2013 and\nthe 2D\u2013behaviour, Eq. (2) and Eq. (1), respectively.\nThe conductance per spin channel, g(b) = \u03c3xx (B)/\u03c30 ,\nis given by the Drude formula g(b) = g0 /(1 + b2 ), (g0 =\nE\u03c4 /h\u0304, b = \u03c9B \u03c4 ) for weak magnetic field, b < 1. For\nb > 1, when the cyclotron length lcyc is smaller than\nthe mean free path l, disregarding the overlap between\nLandau bands, g is obtained in SCBA [25],\n\u0013\n\u0012\n(EF \u2212 En )2\n1\n,\n(4)\ng(B) = (2n + 1) 1 \u2212\n\u03c0\n\u03932\nfor | E \u2212 En |< \u0393.

It oscillates between maximal values in centers of\nLandau bands, and minimal values in band tails (Fig. 2).\nFor n > 1, one finds in band centers,\nq\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f91/2\n2\nln 1 + (Ly /lcyc )\n2\n\uf8fb .

Indeed,\nits maxima are seen to increase linearly with energy E\nin agreement with Eq. (5). The transfer matrix result\nfor the 2-terminal conductance G [35] is shown in Fig. 1\n(solid curve, left axis) for a wire of identical properties,\nbut hard wall boundary conditions and finite length L.\nWe verify that the condition \u03be(Em,p ) = Ly , yields the\nenergies Em,p , p = \u00b1, at which m edge states mix, and\ntransitions from the quasi-1D chiral metal to an insulator occur, as signaled by sharp jumps of G in Fig. 1.\nHere, m = n when this energy is above the bulk energy of the n-th Landau band, p = +, and m = n \u2212 1\nwhen it is below it, p = \u2212. For \u03be < Ly , backscattering between edges is exponentially suppressed and the\nlocalisation length of edge states increases exponentially\nas \u03beedge = \u03be exp(Ly /\u03be). These results are summarised\nin the phase diagram, Fig. 3 a, where the value of G,\nin units of e2 /h, is given as function of wire width Ly\nand energy E in units of h\u0304\u03c9B . We find that G = m,\nwhere m is the\n\u221a number of extended edge states. When\nLy \u2264 lcyc \u221d 2n + 1, all edge states are localised, and\nall conductance plateaus collapse, G = 0, as seen in Fig.\n1, close to the middle of the band, E = 0.\nTaking into account the spin, the Zeeman splitting\nEn+ \u2212En\u2212 = gZ \u03bcB B, lifts the spin degeneracy, where gZ is\nthe material dependent Zeeman-g-factor, and \u03bcB Bohr's\nmagneton. Without spin flip scattering edge states of\ndifferent spins are not mixed. The phase diagram, Fig. 3\nb, is then a superposition of two phase diagrams, Fig.\n3 a, for each spin. There are phases where the conductance is equal to the total number of edge channels,\nG = m+ + m\u2212 , when the bulk localisation length of electrons \u03be \u03c3 , does not exceed the wire width, \u03be \u03c3 < Ly , for\neither spin \u03c3 = \u00b1. When, \u03be \u03c3 > Ly for one spin \u03c3 only,\nthe conductance is carried by the number of edge states\nwith opposite spin, G = m\u2212\u03c3 , only. If \u03be \u03c3 > Ly for both\n\u03c3 = \u00b1, the conductance vanishes, G = 0. With strong\nspin flip scattering, all edge state mix with bulk states for\n\u03be \u03c3 > Ly , yielding G = 0. There are conductance plateaus\nequal to the total number of edge states, G = m+ + m\u2212 ,\nonly if \u03be \u03c3 < Ly is fullfilled for both spins, \u03c3 = \u00b1 (Fig.\n3 c). Thus, both the sequence and width of conductance\nplateaus are sensitive measures of the spin flip scattering\nrate 1/\u03c4s , due to electron-electron interaction, spin-orbit\ninteraction, or scattering from nuclear spins [36]. Furthermore, the enhancement of the gZ \u2013factor above its\nbulk value due to the exchange interaction depends on\nthe Fermi energy [38]. Accordingly, the width of the conductance plateaus changes with energy. In a real sample\nthere exists a slowly varying potential disorder which can\nstabilize edge states against mixing with bulk states [14].\nWhen the confinement potential is varying slowly on the\nmagnetic length scale lB , the energies Em,p are expected\nto split into m energies, at which edge states mix one\nby one with bulk states, accompanied by steps of heights\n\n1 in conductance G. Both potentials can be effectively\nmodified by the Coulomb interaction as obtained by a\nselfconsistent solution of the Poisson equation.\na) 1/Ly\n\n1/l cyc\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1/2\n\nb)\n\n1/Ly\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3/2\n\nE\n\u03c9B\n\n5/2\n\n1/l cyc\n\n0\n1\n\n1\n2\n\n2\n3\n\n2\n\u2212\n\nE0\n\n)\n\n1/Ly\n\n3\n\u2212\n\n+\nE0\n\nE1\n\n4\n\n5\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n+\nE1\n\nE2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n3\n6\n\u2212\n\nE2+\n\nE3\n\n1/l cyc\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n2\n\n1\n\u2212\n\nE0\n\n+\nE0\n\n3\n\u2212\n\nE1\n\n4\n+\nE1\n\n5\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\nE2\n\n0\n6\n\nE2+\n\n\u2212\n\nE3\n\nFIG. 3.

Dotted line: inverse cyclotron length, 1/lcyc . For a particular value of inverse width\n1/Ly (dashed line) a sequence of conductance plateaus similar to Fig. 1 is obtained. In the limit of 1/Ly \u2192 0 there are\ndelocalisation critical points of bulk states (circles).\n\nIn the presence of long range interactions, interacting\nedge states form a correlated Luttinger liquid. Renormalisation due to edge plasmon excitations enhances the\ninteredge scattering amplitude [39]. This results in a decrease of the localisation length of the edge states. Accordingly, the width of the plateaus of lower Landau\nbands is ecpected to be reduced due to the Luttinger\nliquid correlations. Similarly, in the fractional quantum\nHall regime, where the edge state excitations are strongly\ncorrelated even without long range interactions [39], a\nreduction of the localisation length of edge states is expetced as function of the filling factor \u03bd.\nIn 3\u2013D layered systems in perpendicular magnetic field,\nsurface states form 2D chiral metals in plateau regions\nwhere bulk states are localised [18]. There are transitions\nbetween these 2D chiral metals and insulating states in\nlong quasi-1D wires of layered electron systems.\nWe conclude, that in quantum Hall bars of finite width\nLy \u226a \u03ben at low temperatures quantum phase transitions\noccur between extended chiral edge states and a quasi1D insulator. These are driven by the crossover from 2D\nto 1D localization of bulk states. These metal-insulator\ntransitions resemble first-order phase transitions in the\n3\n\n\fsense that the localization length abruptly jumps between exponentially large and finite values. In the thermodynamic limit, fixing the aspect ratio c = L/Ly , when\nsending L \u2192 \u221e, then c \u2192 \u221e, the two\u2013terminal conductance jumps between exactly integer values and zero.\nThe transitions occur at energies where the localization\nlength of bulk states is equal to the geometrical wire\nwidth. Then, m edge states mix and electrons are free to\ndiffuse between the wire boundaries but become Anderson localized along the wire. At finite temperature, this\nphenomenon can be observed, when the phase coherence\nlength exceeds the quasi-1D localization length in centers of Landau bands, L\u03c6 > \u03ben . It may accordingly be\ncalled mesoscopic Chiral Metal\u2013Insulator Transition. In\nHall bars of large aspect ratios at low temperatures one\nshould observe transitions of the two-terminal resistance\nfrom integer quantized plateaus, Rn = h/ne2 to a Mott\nvariable-range hopping regime of exponentially diverging\nresistance. Such experiments would yield new information about edge states in quantum Hall bars. At higher\ntemperature, when L\u03c6 < \u03ben , the conventional form of\nthe integer quantum Hall effect is recovered [1].\nAcknowledgments The authors gratefully acknowledge useful discussions with Bodo Huckestein, Mikhail\nRaikh, Isa Zarekeshev, and Grzegorz Michalek.
