I NTRODUCTION\nWireless networks are subject to fundamental limitations\nin establishing source-destination data sessions. Investigating\nsuch limitations, along with discovering potential communication capabilities of wireless networks is of vital importance in\ndesigning efficient and practical algorithms for their operation.\nWhile Shannon's approach ( [1] ) to mathematical analysis of\ncommunication systems is the most powerful approach, it is\nnot easily extendable to wireless networks with large number\nof nodes.\nThe pioneering work of Gupta and Kumar ( [2] ) in 2000,\nignited the efforts in characterizing the fundamental communication limits and capabilities of wireless networks. Gupta and\nKumar's work, along with\u221asubsequent papers ( [3], [4] and [5]\n), established the order of n achievable aggregate throughput\nfor wireless networks with multihop technology, where n is\nthe number of nodes. However, in another line of research,\nthe linear upper bound of order n is derived for the capacity\nof wireless networks by exploiting information-theoretic maxflow min-cut discussions [6]. The notable work of \u00d6zg\u00fcr et al.\nin 2007 resolves such gap between the upper and lower bounds\n[7]. In fact, by not considering interference as being always\nharmful, and by exploiting Multiple-Input Multiple-Output\n(MIMO) techniques, they propose a hierarchical cooperation\nscheme achieving linear throughput scaling.\nMany of papers on wireless networks capacity, use channel\nmodels based on distance between nodes, while others use\nS.

As also mentioned\nin [8], in many scenarios, a wireless channel model based\non randomness is a more appropriate choice than distancebased models. As an example of such scenario, we can point\nto the case where randomly moving obstacles block signal\npropagation, and the distance-based model cannot address\nsuch issues. Also, when the network area size is small, the\ndominating factor in characterizing the channel properties\nbetween nodes is the random fluctuations due to fading, rather\nthan the distance-based path-loss effect. In addition, in such\nsituation, the network is strongly interference-limited, which\nis best modeled by a random-based channel model. Moreover,\nmany wireless systems employ a unit called Automatic Gain\nControl (AGC) which compensates for the distance effect.\nAccordingly, in many scenarios, it is more suitable to use a\nrandomness-based channel model which is called the \"Random\nConnection Model\". In such model, the channel power \u03b3\nbetween each two nodes is drawn from a common parent\ndistribution f (\u03b3), and different links are independent.\nThe first work considering the random connection model in\ncommunication over wireless networks is by Gowaikar et al.\n[8]. They propose a multihop scheme achieving linear scaling,\nfor a specific case of parent distribution. Their scheme is based\non establishing routes in random graphs. Their subsequent\npaper investigates a model which considers both the geometry\nand randomness effects [9]. Another work using the random\nconnection model is the paper by Cui et al. [10]. In their\nwork, one-hop and two-hop communication schemes are investigated. It is shown that, in the class of parent distributions\nwith finite mean and variance, the one-hop throughput is upper\nbounded by order n1/3 . Also, for two-hop schemes, they\nprovide upper and lower bounds of order n1/2 .\nWhile Cui et al. prove that in one-hop schemes, and in the\nclass of parent distributions with finite mean and variance, one\ncannot surpass the throughput scaling of order n1/3 , they leave\nthe achievability part unanswered. In this letter, we solve this\nopen problem and propose an scheme achieving the throughput\nscaling of order n1/3\u2212\u03b4 , for any \u03b4 > 0 and independent\nof n. Our proposed scheme is very simple and is based on\nestablishing the largest number of concurrent communications.\nThe letter structure is as follows. In section II, the network\nmodel is explained. In section III, we explain the proposed\nscheme and prove that it achieves throughput of order n1/3\u2212\u03b4 .\nFinally, section IV concludes the letter.\nII. N ETWORK M ODEL\nConsider a wireless network consisting of n nodes. Each\nnode is capable of transmitting and receiving signals simulta-\n\n\fneously (i.e., full duplex communication). The nodes follow an\non/off strategy. In such strategy, at each time slot, a subset of\nnodes with m elements are \"on\" and transmit simultaneously,\nwhile other nodes do not transmit any signal. We call the\nsubset of active nodes S. Each node in the network is a source\nof data for exactly one destination, and also, it is destination of\ndata for exactly one source. Thus, we have n sources (i.e., S1 ,\n. . ., Sn ), and n destinations (i.e., D1 , . . ., Dn ). Each source\nnode Si wishes to transmit to the destination node Di for\ni = 1, . . . , n. The signal received by Di at a specific time slot\nis:\nX\nyi =\nhj,i xj + ni\n(1)\n\n\u03b3(1),(1) 6 \u03b3(2),(2) 6, . . . , 6 \u03b3(n),(n)\n\nIn the proposed scheme, at each time slot, the first m\nstrongest source-destination pairs (i.e., S(k) \u2212 D(k) , k = n \u2212\nm+ 1, . . . , n) are active, and other nodes are inactive. In other\nwords, at each time slot, sources S(k) , k = n \u2212 m + 1, . . . , n\nbroadcast their signals simultaneously, and the corresponding\nreceivers D(k) , k = n \u2212 m + 1, . . . , n attempt to decode\ntheir messages. If we define M as the number of successful\nreceptions, by defining r , n \u2212 m + 1, for the network\nthroughput we have 1 :\n\nj\u2208S\n\nwhere xj is the signal transmitted by jth source node, and\nhj,i is the channel gain between Sj and Di . We define \u03b3j,i ,\n|hj,i |2 to be the channel power, which is a random variable\ndrawn from the parent distribution f (\u03b3). In addition, all links\nare independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.). Finally,\nni is the additive white gaussian noise at each receiver whose\nvariance is N0 .\nThe communication between Si and Di is successful, if and\nonly if the received Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio\n(SINR) at Di is above a given threshold level:\nSIN Ri ,\n\nN0 +\n\n\u03b3\nP i,i\n\nj\u2208S,j6=i\n\n\u03b3j,i\n\n>\u03b2\n\n(2)\n\nAs explained earlier, such channel mode, also known as the\n\"Random Connection Model\" is a very appropriate model in\nmany network scenarios [8], [10].\n\nE{M } =\n\nn\nX\n\nP{SIN R(k) > \u03b2}\n\n(4)\n\nk=r\n\n> mP{SIN R(r) > \u03b2}\n= mP{\u03b3(r),(r) > \u03b2(N0 +\n\nn\nX\n\nOF\n\nTheorem 1\nThere exists a one-hop communication scheme achieving the\nthroughput of order n1/3\u2212\u01eb/3 for any strictly positive \u01eb. The\nparent distribution resulting in this throughput is f (\u03b3) =\n2+\u01eb\n(1+\u03b3)3+\u01eb for \u03b3 > 0, which has finite mean and variance.\nProof:\nConsider source nodes S1 , . . . , Sn and destination nodes\nD1 , . . . , Dn . The channel power between Si and Di is \u03b3i,i .\nLet us sort the source and destination pairs based on the power\nof direct link between them (i.e., \u03b3i,i 's). Define S(n\u2212i+1) \u2212\nD(n\u2212i+1) as the source-destination pair which have ith most\npowerful channel, \u03b3(n\u2212i+1),(n\u2212i+1) . Thus, we have:\n\nn\nX\n\n> mP{\u03b3(r),(r) > 2\u03b2\u03b3\u0304m}P{\u03b2(N0 +\n\n\u03b3(j),(r) ) < 2\u03b2\u03b3\u0304m}\n\nj=r+1\n\nwhere \u03b3\u0304 , E{f (\u03b3)}. The first inequality is due to the fact\nthat S(r) \u2212 D(r) has the weakest direct channel power among\nthe active pairs. The last inequality\nis due to the indepenPn\ndence of \u03b3(r),(r) and \u03b2(N0 + j=r+1 \u03b3(j),(r) ). According to\nMarkov's inequality we have:\nP{\u03b2(N0 +\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03b3(j),(r) ) > 2\u03b2\u03b3\u0304m} 6\n\nO RDER n1/3\n\nWe consider one-hop communication between sources and\ndestinations. At each time slot, the nodes belonging to the\nactive subset S broadcast their signals, and the rest of the\nnodes do not transmit. We define the one-hop throughput of\nthe network as the expected number of successful receptions\nat each time slot (similar to [10]). Cui et al. have proved that\nthe throughput of such one-hop strategy, when f (\u03b3) has finite\nmean and variance, is upper bounded by order n1/3 . In this\nsection, we propose an achievable scheme which achieves the\nthroughput of order n1/3\u2212\u03b4 for any \u03b4 > 0 and independent\nof n. The main result of the letter is stated in the following\ntheorem:\n\n\u03b3(j),(r) )}\n\nj=r+1\n\nj=r+1\n\nIII.

Define X(1) , . . . , X(n) to be the order\nstatistics of these random variables.

In our scheme, we look for the statistical properties of \u03b3(r),(r) to analyze P{\u03b3(r),(r) > 2\u03b2\u03b3\u0304m},\nwhich appears in (6) (note that r = n \u2212 m + 1, and m\nis the number of active sources.). Thus, we have the same\n\"intermediate order statistics\" problem as the one stated in\nTheorem 2. Consequently, we put:\n\nIV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this letter, we have proved that the lower bound of\none-hop communication in wireless networks with random\nconnection model, in the class of finite mean and variance\nchannel powers, is n1/3\u2212\u03b4 , where \u03b4 > 0 is independent of\nn. Our result, combined withmises the upper bound of n1/3\nderived by Cui et al., characterizes the throughput capacity of\nsuch networks.\nV.
