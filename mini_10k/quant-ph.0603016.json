Sinatra\n\narXiv:quant-ph/0603016v3 18 Jan 2007\n\nLaboratoire Kastler Brossel, ENS, 24 Rue Lhomond, 75231 Paris Cedex 05, France\nWe show that three-level atoms excited by two cavity modes in a \u039b configuration close to electromagnetically induced transparency can produce strongly squeezed bright beams or correlated\nbeams which can be used for quantum non demolition measurements. The input intensity is the\nexperimental \"knob\" for tuning the system into a squeezer or a quantum non demolition device.\nThe quantum correlations become ideal at a critical point characterized by the appearance of a\nswitching behavior in the mean fields intensities. Our predictions, based on a realistic fully quantum 3-level model including cavity losses and spontaneous emission, allow direct comparison with\nfuture experiments.\nPACS numbers: 42.50.Dv,42.50.Gy,42.65.Pc\n\nUsing optical nonlinearities it is possible to manipulate\noptical beams to the level of quantum fluctuations, producing squeezed states [1] that are important resources\nfor quantum information with continuous variables [2].\nRelated to the field of squeezing is that of quantum\nnon demolition (QND) measurements on an optical field,\nwhere quantum correlations between two different modes\nof the electromagnetic field are exploited to overcome the\nback-action noise of a quantum measurement [3]. Besides\nthe fundamental interest in the theory of measurement, it\nwas shown that QND correlations of propagating beams\nhave direct application in quantum communication protocols as teleportation [4]. The best single back-actionevading measurement on optical beams was performed\nusing cold atoms inside a doubly resonant cavity [5]. We\nsuggest that these performances could be significantly\nimproved by tuning the system close to the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) conditions [6].\nAlready in the nineties, theoretical studies showed that\na lambda three-level medium close to EIT conditions in\na cavity can be used to obtain squeezing [7]. Contrarily\nto previous proposals, here we assume that two different\nmodes are resonant in the cavity. For small and symmetrical detunings from the upper level of \u039b three-level\natoms (see Fig.1), absorption is suppressed and the dispersive non linear response gives rise to a rich scenario\nwhere either self correlations (squeezing) or cross QND\ncorrelations can be established in the output beams. The\ncorrelations become ideal at a critical point that we characterize analytically. The technique we propose is experimentally accessible, and first experimental steps in this\ndirections were done in atomic vapors without a cavity\n[8]. Here we show that the presence of the cavity is a crucial advantage especially if one can reach the good cavity\nlimit.\nWe consider N atoms in a cavity excited by two modes\nsymmetrically detuned from the upper level of a \u039b threelevel scheme as in Fig.1. For j = 1, 2 let \u03c9j be the frequency of field j and h\u0304\u03c9aj the energy of the corresponding\n\n2\u03b5\na1\n\n3\na2\n2\n\n1\n\nFIG. 1: Two cavity modes interact with the atoms in a \u039b\nconfiguration close to EIT conditions.\n\n\u03c9\n\n\u2212\u03c9\n\natomic transition. We define \u2206j = aj\u03b3w j the atomic detunings normalized to the decay rate of the optical coherences \u03b3w = (\u03b31 + \u03b32 )/2 where \u03b31 + \u03b32 is the total popula\u03c9 \u2212\u03c9\ntion decay rate of the upper level; \u03b8j = cj\u03baj j the cavity\ndetunings normalized to the cavity decay rates \u03baj , and\ng2 N\n\nCj = \u03b3wj \u03baj the cooperativities where gj are the coupling\nconstants for the two considered transitions. We use normalized variables\u221aproportional to the\u221a intracavity and in2g\n2g\nput fields xj = \u03b3w j haj i and yj = \u03b3w j \u221a2 Ejin respecTj\n\ntively, where Tj is the (input-output) mirror transmissivity for the field j. We name v and w the normalized\npolar\u221a\nizations \u221a\nbetween levels 1-3 and 2-3 v = \u2212( 2/N )hR\u2212 i,\nw = \u2212( 2/N )hS \u2212 i where R and S are collective operators constructed from the single atom operators |1ih3|\nand |2ih3| as in [9]. The master equation and the semiclassical equations describing the \u039b system with two cavity fields, with the same notations introduced here, are\ngiven and discussed in detail in [10] where this model was\nsuccessful to reproduce the experimental results of [5].\nLet us consider a set of parameters symmetric for the\ntwo transitions: |yj | = |y|, Cj = C, \u03b3j = \u03b3, \u03baj = \u03ba,\n\u03b8j = 0 (empty cavity resonance for both fields), and let\n\u22061 = \u2212\u22062 = \u01eb be small and positive. In Fig. 2 we show\nin rescaled units the stationary intensities of the intracavity fields Ij = |xj |2 /4C\u01eb as a function of the common\nintensity of the input fields Y = |y|2 /4C\u01eb.

In solid line the solution I1 = I2 . The thick\n(red thin) line correspond to stable (unstable) solutions. In\ndashed-dotted line one of the two stable solutions with I1 6=\nI2 . Parameters: 2\u01eb = 0.125 and C1 = C2 = 250, \u03b31 = \u03b32 =\n10\u03ba1 , \u03ba2 = \u03ba1 , \u03b81 = \u03b82 = 0.\n\nline we have plotted an S-shaped solution with I1 = I2 .\nA stable branch of this solution appears for Y > 1. The\nnegative slope branch and the lower branch very close to\nzero intensity are both instable and play no role in the\nfollowing. For Y < 1, apart from the solution I1 = I2 ,\nwe get two other solutions with I1 6= I2 . In the figure\nwe show one of them with I1 > I2 . The second one is\nobtained by exchanging I1 and I2 . Both solutions are\nstable in the considered case \u03b81 = \u03b82 = 0.\nWe choose now two values of the input intensity, in\nturn above and below the turning point Y = 1, and\nshow the stationary solutions for intracavity fields intensities as the cavity detunings vary in Fig. 3. The stable branches of these curves (thick lines) can be easily\nobtained experimentally by sweeping the cavity length\n[10]. We vary \u03b81 and \u03b82 keeping them always equal which\nwould imply the use of two driving fields of close optical\nfrequencies \u2206\u03bb/\u03bb \u226a 1 (and for example different polarizations). For Y = 1.05 i.e. 5% above the turning point\n(upper half of Fig. 3) the stable solutions for the intracavity intensities are Lorentzian-looking curves symmetrically shifted by a small amount from their empty-cavity\npositions for both fields. Only for \u03b81 = \u03b82 = 0 the two\nfields have the same stationary amplitude in the cavity\ncorresponding to the stable high-transmission branch of\nthe S-shaped curve in Fig.2. For Y = 0.95 i.e. 5% below\nthe turning point (lower half of Fig. 3) the situation is\nrather different: the stable solution for the two fields\nswitches between a high-intensity and a low-intensity\ncurve being always I1 6= I2 although |y1 | = |y2 |. In contrast with the previous case this situation is very far from\nthe independent-fields EIT solution and the fields are in\nfact strongly coupled.\nLet us now introduce the usefull correlations to caracterize the quantum fluctuation properties of the system.\nFor a given quadrature of the j th field: Xj\u03c6 = aj e\u2212i\u03c6 +\n\n1.2\n\n1.2\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\nI1\n\nY1= Y2\n\nI1\n\n0.5\n\n1.2\n\n1.0\n\nI1\n\nI1 , I2\n\n1.5\n\n1.2\n\nI2\n\n2.0\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n0.0\n-3\n\n-2\n\n\u03b81\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n\u03b81\n\nFIG. 3: Intracavity field intensities I1 (left half), I2 (right\nhalf) across the cavity scan.

For an ideal\nQND measurement Cm = Cs = 1, and Vs|m = 0.\nThe quantum fluctuations counterpart of Fig. 3 (top) is\nshown in Fig. 4 (top) where squeezing of the output fields\noptimized with respect to the quadrature Sjbest (\u03c9 = 0) is\nplotted as a function of the cavity detuning. A large\namount of squeezing is present in both fields close to\n\u03b81 = 0. As one can see from Fig. 3 (top) the two fields are\nwell transmitted by the cavity for \u03b81 = 0, and the system\nefficiently converts the input coherent beams into bright\nsqueezed beams. Correspondingly to Fig. 3 (bottom) for\nY = 0.95, in Fig.4 (bottom) we plot the coefficients Cs ,\nCm and Vs|m across the cavity scan. The useful quantum correlations are calculated by a linearized treatment\nof quantum fluctuations around the stable stationary solution as in [10]. Despite the fact that the two fields have\ndifferent intracavity intensities at \u03b81 = 0, they play here\nsymmetrical roles for the QND scheme; the figure corresponding to the reversed scheme 1 \u2194 2 being obtained\nby reflection of the plots \u03b81 \u2194 \u2212\u03b81 .\n\nQND Coefficients\n\n\u03c6\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n-1.0\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n\u03b81\nFIG. 4: Top: Best squeezing of the fields across the cavity\nscan for Y = 1.05 and \u03c9 = 0. Squeezing of field 1 (2) is\nplotted with a solid (dashed) line. Bottom: QND coefficients\nacross the cavity scan for Y = 0.95 and \u03c9 = 0. Cm (red\ndashed-dotted line), Cs (solid line), Vs|m (blue dashed line).\nParameters as in Fig.3.\n\nWe show in Fig. 5 the frequency dependence of the\nquantum correlations both below and above the turning\npoint Y = 1, for a fixed value of the cavity detuning close\nto zero. For values of the cooperativity parameters currently obtained in experiments, QND coefficients such as\nCs = 0.98, Cm = 0.95, Vs|m = 0.05 can be acheived\n\nin this regime, representing a significant improvement\nwith respect to previously obtained results [5] based on\nthe so called \"ghost transition\" scheme [12], [10]. Although we concentrate here on the good cavity limit, in\nwhich as we will show the quantum correlations become\nideal approaching the turining point Y = 1, some QND\ncorrelations between the two modes persist also in the\nbad cavity limit. For example for \u01eb = 0.25, C = 25,\n\u03ba = 3\u03b3, \u03b81 = 6 \u00d7 10\u22123 , Y = 0.9 and \u03c9 = 0.1\u03b3 we get\nCs = Cm = 0.72, Vs|m = 0.26.\nIn the limit of weak atomic detunings, useful analytical\nresults can be obtained. The analytical solution of the\nsemiclassical equations of the system at steady state is\ngiven in [10]. By expanding the steady state polarizations\nv and w to the first order in \u01eb we obtain\nv=i\n\n4\u01eb x1 |x2 |2\n(|x1 |2 + |x2 |2 )2\n\nw = \u2212i\n\n4\u01eb x2 |x1 |2\n.\n(|x1 |2 + |x2 |2 )2\n\n(6)\n\nBy inserting (6) in the equations for the intracavity fields\namplitudes, with |yj | = |y|, \u03b8j = 0 and Cj = C, we\nobtain at steady state a \"universal solution\" for rescaled\nfield intensities. For Y < 1 there are two stable solutions\nI1 =\n\nY\n(1 \u00b1 \u03b7) ;\n2\n\nI2 =\n\nY\n(1 \u2213 \u03b7)\n2\n\n(7)\n\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 Y 2 . For Y > 1, out of two solutions\n!\nr\nY\n1\nI1 = I2 = I ; I =\n1\u00b1 1\u2212 2\n(8)\n2\nY\n\nwhere \u03b7 =\n\n\f4\nthe one with the plus sign is stable and the other one\nunstable. Solutions (7)-(8) are indistinguishable from\nthose of the full three-level model in Fig. 2. The\nphases of the input fields with respect to intracavity\nfieldsh (which iare taken real at\nsteadyistate) are \u03c6in\n1 =\nhp\np\nin\nI2 /I1 , \u03c62 = \u2212atan\nI1 /I2 for Y < 1, and\natan\n\nin\n\u03c6in\n1 = atan [1/2I] = \u2212\u03c62 for Y > 1. For the output\nout\nin\nout\nfields \u03c61 = \u2212\u03c61 , \u03c62 = \u2212\u03c6in\n2 in both cases.\nIn order to study the quantum properties of the system\nanalytically we further assume that (i) \u03b3 \u226b \u03ba so that the\natomic fluctuations follow adiabatically the field fluctuations, and (ii) the noise from spontaneous emission is\nnegligible, which we found true when the cooperativity\nis large enough. In this limit, using the steady state polarizations (6), we can solve analytically the equations\nfor the field fluctuations and obtain the correlation functions.\nFor Y > 1 and I1 = I2 = I and taking \u03ba\u22121 as the unit\nof time, we obtain\n\n\u03b4 \u1e8bj = \u2212\u03b4xj + i\n\n(\u22121)3\u2212j \u2217\n\u03b4xj\n2I\n\nj = 1, 2 .\n\n(9)\n\nThese equations describe two independent two-photon\nprocesses for which instabilities and squeezing have been\nstudied extensively [13]. The best squeezing spectrum\nfor each field is\nSjbest (\u03c9) = 1 \u2212\n\n4a\n2\n\n(1 + a)2 + \u03c9/\u03ba\n\n,\n\na=\n\n1\n, (10)\n2I\n\nyielding perfect squeezing at zero frequency at the turning point where Y = 1, I = 0.5 and a = 1.\nFor Y < 1 and I1 6= I2 the fluctuations of the two fields\nare coupled. For I1 > I2 we get\n1\u2212\u03b7\n\u03b4Y1\nY\n1+\u03b7\n= \u2212\u03b4Y1 + i\n\u03b4X1 \u2212 2i \u03b7\u03b4X2 .\nY\n\n\u03b4X1 = \u2212\u03b4X1 \u2212 i\n\n(11)\n\n\u03b4Y1\n\n(12)\n\nThe equations for field 2 are obtained from (11) and (12)\nby changing the sign in front of \u03b7 and of i. Simple analytical expressions can be obtained for the squeezing and\nthe conditional variance Vs|m of the fields at \u03c9 = 0\nSjint = Sjbest = 1 ; Sjphase = \u22123 +\nVs|m =\n\n\u03b72\n4 \u2212 3\u03b7 2\n\n4\n\u03b72\n\n(13)\n(14)\n\nshowing that the fields have diverging phase noise and\nbecome perfectly correlated at the turning point. We\nchecked that the spectra in Fig. 5 are well reproduced\nby the analytical results.\nIn conclusion, in a symmetrically detuned EIT scheme,\nand for equal input intensities Y of the two fields we have\nshown the existence of a universal S-shaped steady state\n\ncurve (Fig.2) which divides the parameter space into two\nparts: for input intensities higher than the upper turning point of the curve, the quantum fluctuations of the\nfields become quadrature dependent and can be reduced\nin a quadrature, while for input intensities lower than\nthe turning point, crossed phase-intensity quantum correlations build up between the two fields. The system\nbecomes a perfect \"squeezer\" or an ideal QND device at\nthe turning point. The \"universal\" point Y = 1, can\nbe identified experimentally by the appearance of the\nswitching behavior described in Fig.3, and can be used\nas a reference in the parameter space to choose either the\nsqueezing or the QND effect and to optimize it. An implementation using either a vapor [8], or a trapped cold\natoms in an optical cavity [5],[14],[15] seems within the\nreach of present technology.\nI thank L. Lugiato and P.
