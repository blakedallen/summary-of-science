INTRODUCTION\n\nReal-space methods have proven their utility in calculating the linear response of finite\nsystems in time-dependent density functional theory [1,2]. However, there has been the\nperception that real-space methods are unsuitable for infinite periodic systems. The problem\nis that the long range polarization currents are important but are dynamically independent\nof the local state of the electrons within the unit cell. Stated differently, the polarization\ngives rise to a surface charge at the surface of any finite sample, but the resulting electric\nfield is independent of the charge density within any cell in the interior. The necessity to\nintroduce the polarization as an independent degree of freedom has been well recognized in\nthe literature of the density functional theory [3\u20136].\nWe will show here that in fact it is straightforward to treat infinite systems in the realtime formulation of TDDFT, simply by adding as one additional dynamic variable the surface\ncharge. Formally, this is conveniently done adding a gauge field in within a Lagrangian. A\ngauge formalism has also been very recently applied by Kootskra et al [7], however using\na frequency representation rather than solving real-time equations. In our formulation, we\nderive the dynamic equations from the Lagrangian:\nL=\n\nZ\n\n3\n\n\u03a9\n\ndr\n\nP\n\ni\n\n~ i /i \u2212 eA\u1e91\u03c6i |2\n1 ~\n|\u2207\u03c6\n~ (r) + en(r)V (r) + enion (r)V (r)+\n(r) * \u2207V\n+ \u2207V\n2m\n8\u03c0\n!\n\n\u03a9\nVxc [n(r)] + Vion [\u03c1(r, r )] \u2212\n8\u03c0\n\u2032\n\ndA\ndt\n\n!2\n\n\u2212i\n\nZ\n\n\u03a9\n\nd3 r\n\nX\ni\n\n\u03c6\u2217i\n\n(1)\n\n\u2202\u03c6i\n.\n\u2202t\n\nHere the \u03c6i are the Bloch wave functions of the electrons, normalized so that n(r) =\nP\n\ni\n\n|\u03c6i (r)|2 is the electron density. The volume of the unit cell is \u03a9. The electromagnetic in-\n\nteraction is separated into a Coulomb field V (~r) that satisfies periodic boundary conditions\nin the unit cell and a vector gauge field \u1e91A(t). Note that the gauge field is uniform, without\nany dependence on r. The electric field is then given by\n~ \u2212 \u1e91 dA .\nE~ = \u2212\u2207V\ndt\nIn these formal equations, we use units with h\u0304 = c = 1.\n2\n\n\fThe other pieces of the first integral are the usual terms in the Kohn-Sham energy functional. The term en(r)V (r) gives the direct Coulomb interaction of the electrons, except for\nthe surface charging. The ionic interaction is separated1 into a long-range part that can be\nassociated with an ionic charge density nion (r) and a short-range part Vion . The latter depends on the orbital angular momentum of the electrons in typical ab initio pseudopotentials.\nIt therefore depends on the full one-electron density matrix \u03c1(r, r \u2032 ) =\n\nP\n\ni\n\n\u03c6\u2217i (r)\u03c6i (r \u2032 ). We\n\nhave emphasized this point because nonlocal interactions do not respect gauge invariance.\nThe invariance is of course restored if the density matrix is gauged. If one expresses the\nnonlocality in terms of the operator \u2207, one makes the replacement \u2207 \u2192 \u2207 \u2212 ieA\u1e91. Finally,\nthe Vxc is the usual exchange-correlation energy density of density functional theory.\nRequiring the Lagrangian action to be stationary gives equations of motion for \u03c6i and\nA and the Poisson equation for V . The dynamic equation for \u03c6i is the time-dependent\nKohn-Sham equation,\n\u2212\n\n\u22072\ne\ne2 2\n\u03b4Vion \u03b4Vxc\n\u2202\n\u03c6i \u2212\nA\u2207z \u03c6i +\nA \u03c6i + (eV +\n+\n)\u03c6i = i \u03c6i\n2m\nmi\n2m\n\u03b4n\n\u03b4n\n\u2202t\n\n(2)\n\nThe equation for A is\ne X\n\u03b4\ne2\n\u03a9 d2 A\n\u2212\nANe +\nh\u03c6\n|\u2207\n/i|\u03c6\ni\n+\ni\nz\ni\n2\n4\u03c0 dt\nm i\nm\n\u03b4A\nwhere Ne =\n\nR\n\n\u03a9\n\nZ\n\n\u03a9\n\nVion d3 r = 0\n\n(3)\n\nd3 rn(r) is the number of electrons per unit cell.\n\nII. LINEAR RESPONSE, SUM RULE AND SIMPLE MODELS\n\nThe calculation of the dielectric function using the above real-time dynamic equations\nis very similar to the corresponding calculation of dynamic polarizability of finite systems\n[2]. We first solve the static equations (with A=0) to get the ground state electron orbitals\n\n1 The\n\nseparation is somewhat arbitrary, but is useful because the periodicity of V then takes the\n\nionic lattice into account automatically.\n\n3\n\n\fand the periodic Coulomb potential V . The system is then perturbed by making a sudden\nchange in A, A(t = 0+ ) = A0 . This corresponds to applying a short-duration electric field\nat t = 0, E(t) = \u2212A0 \u03b4(t). The dynamic equations are then applied to evolve the variables\nin time, finding the time evolution of the polarization electric field E(t) = \u2212dA(t)/dt. The\ndielectric function \u01eb(\u03c9) is just the ratio of the Fourier components of the external and the\ntotal fields; it is given by\n1\n1\n\u22121=\n\u01eb(\u03c9)\nA0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0+\n\nei\u03c9t\u2212\u03b7t\n\ndA(t)\ndt.\ndt\n\n(4)\n\nHere \u03b7 is a small quantity to establish the imaginary part of the response. In principle the\nresulting theory automatically respects the Kramers-Kronig relation.\nThe linear energy-weighted sum rule is easily derived in this formalism. The sum rule\nmay be expressed as\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n\u03c9Im \u01eb\u22121 (\u03c9)d\u03c9 = \u2212\n\n2\u03c0 2 e2 Ne\n.\nm\u03a9\n\n(5)\n\nTo calculate the sum rule with our Lagrangian, we write the integral using eq. (4)\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n1\n\u03c9Im \u01eb (\u03c9)d\u03c9 =\nA0\n\u22121\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n0\n\ndA\ndt Im\ndt\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ni\u03c9t\u2212\u03b7t\n\nd\u03c9\u03c9e\n\n\u03c0\n=\n2A0\n\nd2 A\ndt2\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(6)\n\nt=0+\n\nThe second derivative in the last expression can be easily found from eq. (3). At t = 0+ ,\nthe wave functions have not yet had time to change, A(0+ ) = A0 and h\u2207z i = 0. Then if the\nlast term in eq. (3) can be neglected,\nd2 A\n4\u03c0e2 Ne A0\n=\u2212\ndt2\nm\u03a9\n\n(7)\n\nand eq. (5) follows immediately. Thus the time-dependent treatment satisfies the sum rules\nautomatically to the extent permitted by the last term. That term is only nonzero for nonlocal pseudopotentials, and in fact it may improve the accuracy of the theory by incorporating\neffects of the core electrons on the dynamic properties [8].\nLet us now see how the gauge field treatment works in a simple analytically solvable\nmodel, namely the electron gas. As mentioned before, when the field A0 is applied, there is\n4\n\n\fno immediate response to the operator \u2207, since the wave function does not change instantaneously. However, in the Fermi gas, the single-particle states are eigenstates of momentum\nso the response remains h\u2207i = 0 for all time. Putting this in eq. (3), and dropping the\npseudopotential term, the equation for A becomes simple harmonic motion, with the solution\nA(t) = A0 cos \u03c9pl t\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03c9pl is the plasmon frequency,\n2\n\u03c9pl\n=\n\n4\u03c0e2 Ne\n4\u03c0e2 n\n=\n.\nm\u03a9\nm\n\n(9)\n\nThe dielectric function may now be calculated from the time integral eq. (4). One obtains\nthe familiar electron gas result,\n2\n\u03c9pl\n\u01eb(\u03c9) = 1 \u2212 2 .\n\u03c9\n\n(10)\n\nOne sees that the derivation here is much simpler than the usual one using the Coulomb\ngauge. There one formulates the response in a particle-hole representation, and takes the\nexternal field to be of the form eiq*r with q finite. The dielectric function is then found by\ntaking the q \u2192 0 limit.\nWe can make another simple model for the opposite extreme of a tightly bound electron\nin the unit cell. Assume that the ion potential eVion (r) + \u03b4Vion /\u03b4n can be approximated\nby a harmonic oscillator potential in the region over which the electron wave function is\nappreciable. According to Kohn's theorem [9], the response is just the same as for an\nisolated electron in the same ionic potential. This comes out of eq. (2-3) in the following\nway. The initial impulse A0 starts the electron moving, and as a result both V (r) and\n\u03b4Vxc /\u03b4n(r) become time-dependent. Together with the changing A, the electron in the unit\ncell drags its self-induced field with it, and the accelerations associated with these three\nterms in eq. (2) exactly cancel. The remaining ionic terms then produce simple harmonic\nmotion for \u03c6.\n\n5\n\n\fIII. NUMERICAL DETAILS\n\nThe computational algorithm we employ is identical to the ones we used for clusters and\nmolecules, which was based on a method introduced in nuclear physics [10]. The KohnSham operator is represented on a real space grid as in ref. [11]. There are a number of\ntechnical details associated with the periodicity and with the gauge potential that did not\narise for the finite-system calculations. In the new code, the potential V (r) is calculated by\nFourier transformation of the Poisson equation rather than a relaxation method. This gives\nautomatically the required periodicity to V (r). The wave functions \u03c6i represent Bloch states\nof the periodic lattice, and they are constructed with the corresponding periodic boundary\nconditions labeled by the Bloch momenta k. The periodic boundary condition on the Bloch\nwave function \u03c6k (r+a) = exp(iak)\u03c6k (r) is easily implemented in the relaxation method used\nto find eigenstates. In practice, many Bloch states are needed to obtain smooth dielectric\nfunctions. However, constructing the states takes much less time than for the same number\nof electrons in a finite system, because the Bloch states in a given band are automatically\northogonal.\nWe use here the same energy density functional that we used previously for finite systems. Only the valence electrons are included explicitly; core electrons are treated by a\npseudopotential [12,13]. The exchange-correlation energy of the electrons is calculated in\nthe local density approximation following the prescription of ref. [14].\nThe presence of a vector gauge potential requires a modification in the pseudopotential\ncalculation, as indicated in the introduction. In particular, the A-dependence of the Vion\nterm in eq. (2) must be consistent with the last term in eq. (3) in order to have the\nalgorithm conserve energy. We implement the A-dependence of Vion simply by gauging the\ndensity matrix directly,\n\u2032\n\nVion,A (\u03c1(r, r \u2032 )) = Vion (eiA(z\u2212z ) \u03c1(r, r \u2032 ))\nAs in the finite systems calculations, energy is conserved to a very high accuracy with the\n6\n\n\falgorithm [10], provided the time step is less than the inverse energy span of the Kohn-Sham\noperator.\n\nIV. LITHIUM\n\nIn this section we demonstrate the feasibility of the method with lithium as an example\nof a simple metal. As other alkali metals, lithium has a Fermi surface which is nearly\nspherical. However, unlike sodium and potassium, the effective mass of the electrons at the\nFermi surface is significantly enhanced over the free-Fermi gas value (m\u2217 \u2248 1.6me ).\nThe Kohn-Sham operator is represented in coordinate space with a uniform spatial mesh.\nThe lattice spacing of the bcc unit cell of Li metal is a = 3.49 \u00c5, and we take a mesh spacing\nof \u2206x = 0.58 to subdivide the cell into a 63 lattice of mesh points. We use a time step of\n\u2206t = 0.01 eV\u22121 which is sufficient to conserve energy to 10\u22124 eV over the time integration\ninterval, T = 18 eV\u22121 .\nWe sample the occupied states with a uniform mesh in momentum space. With a finite\nset of occupied orbitals, the allowed excitation energies will be discrete, and the metallic\nbehavior, \u01eb(\u03c9) \u2192 \u221e, is only reached in the limit of an infinitely dense momentum space\nlattice. However, it is our view that the TDLDA loses validity at long times when other\ndegrees of freedom can be excited. This is the case for the low frequency response of metals,\nwhere the imaginary part of the dielectric responses is dominated by phonons and inelastic\nelectron scattering.\nIn Fig. 1 we show the normalized time-dependent polarization field, A\u22121\n0 dA/dt over the\ntime interval t = [0, 18] eV\u22121 . The inset shows an expanded view of the initial response in\nthe interval [0,1] eV\u22121 . The dashed line is the comparison with the linear behavior deduced\n2\nfrom the sum rule, A\u22121\n0 dA/dt = \u22124\u03c0e Ne t/m\u03a9. The agreement shows that the local sum\n\nrule in nearly satisfied, despite the fairly large optical effective mass.\nIn Fig. 2 we show the inverse dielectric function computed from eq. (4) for various\nmeshes in the Brillouin zone. We employ \u03b7 = 0.2 eV to smooth the response in the Fourier\n7\n\n\ftransformation. We see that the response becomes smoother, the more finely the Fermi sea\nis sampled. With a 323 lattice of Bloch states, we get results smooth enough to be compared\nwith measurement.\nIn Fig. 3 we show the real and imaginary parts of the inverse dielectric function in the\nfrequency interval 0 \u2212 20 eV/h\u0304. The dashed lines show the empirical function from ref. [15].\nThere is also another theoretical calculation in the literature, [16]. The agreement is quite\ngood, especially considering that the calculation is ab initio with a energy density functional\nthat much simpler than more recent ones. The main feature in the absorptive response is\nthe plasmon at 7 eV and its width. The peak position is significantly downshift from the\nnaive plasmon frequency, \u03c9 =\n\nq\n\n4\u03c0e2 n/m \u2248 8 eV. The width is associated with interband\n\ntransitions and is also well reproduced.\n\nV. DIAMOND\n\nIn this section we compute the dielectric response of a typical elemental insulator, diamond. The diamond lattice is represented in our calculation by the primitive unit cell\nwhich contains 8 carbon atoms. The four valence electrons of each carbon are calculated\nexplicitly while the core electrons are only treated implicitly by the pseudopotential. We\nfound in earlier studies of carbon structures that the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian requires a\nmesh spacing \u2206x = 0.3 \u00c5 to get orbital energies to an accuracy of 0.1 eV; in the calculation\nhere we take a 123 lattice in the unit cell which implies \u2206x = 3.56/12 \u00c5 = 0.297 \u00c5. With a\nsmaller mesh spacing than for lithium, the span the Kohn-Sham operator is increased and\nthe time step \u2206t must be reduced accordingly. We use here \u2206t = 0.002 eV\u22121 .\nWith a cubical unit cell and 8 carbon atoms, there are 8 * 4/2 = 16 occupied bands2 . In\neach band we take a lattice of up to 163 points to represent the Bloch states.\n\n2 The\n\nbands are actually two-fold degenerate because we have not exploited the symmetry that\n\nallows a smaller unit cell with 4 carbons.\n\n8\n\n\fFor an insulator, a reference point of the vector potential A(t) should be irrelevant. Since\nall the points within Brillouin zone are occupied, there is a static solution of eq.(2-3) for\neach constant vector potential. However, in our real-space, real-time calculation, we found\nthis is violated due to the discrete representation in coordinate and momentum spaces. The\ntotal energy does depend on A, and there appears a spurious low frequency mode in the\nvector potential A(t) associated with the adiabatic evolution of the electronic wave function.\nBelow that frequency, a spurious conduction feature appears in the response.\nThese features are shown in the plots of the response in Fig. 4. We see that the spurious\nadiabatic evolution gives an unphysical plasmon at \u2248 1.2 eV, which dominates the dielectric\nresponse at lower frequencies. Though the amount of strength associated with this spurious\nplasmon is very small, 0.007 electrons out of the total of 32, it has a qualitative effect on the\nresponse at very low frequency. The frequency and strength decrease the finer the spatial\nmesh, showing that it is an artifact of the discrete mesh representation of the coordinate\nspace.\nTo infer the dielectric function near \u03c9 = 0, we apply the Kramers-Kronig relation to the\nimaginary part of the response, but excluding the spurious plasmon peak. This gives the\npredicted dielectric function shown in Fig. 5. The empirical dielectric function is shown as\nthe dashed line. The agreement is good, as indeed was found solving the TDLDA equations\nby other methods [17], but one can also see the effect of the well-known shortcoming of\nTDLDA, that the predicted band gaps are too small [18,19]. The theoretical absorption\nstrength become significant starting at about 5 eV excitation, while the empirical absorption\nbegins at around 7 eV. Nevertheless, the dielectric constant comes out in good agreement\nwith the empirical [17], being within a percent of the empirical value of \u01eb(0) = 5.67.\n\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe see that the method not only works in principle, but produces fairly accurate dielectric functions in the cases of a simple metal and a simple insulator. In lithium, the\n9\n\n\ftheory describes the metallicity as well as the interband transitions. In diamond, there is\na spurious plasmon at low frequency due to the discrete mesh representation in coordinate\nand momentum spaces. However, it can be easily dealt with and then the dielectric function has an excellent quality except for a small band gap region. We find that two benefits\nof the real-space, real-time formulation of the TDLDA in finite systems [20] are preserved\nin our implementation here. The real-space method allows the Kohn-Sham operator and\nelectron-electron interactions to be evaluated efficiently [11]. Computational efficiency is\nalso gained by calculating the response in real time in that all frequencies are calculated\nat once. Finally, the method requires much less storage than methods using a particle-hole\nrepresentation of the time-varying wave function.\n\nVII. ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\nWe acknowledge discussions with E.K.U.
