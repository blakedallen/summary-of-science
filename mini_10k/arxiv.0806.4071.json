Introduction\nThe standard model of mass distribution in clusters of galaxies assumes that both gas and\ndark matter are in hydrostatic equilibrium within the binding cluster potential. Recently many\nstudies have compared mass measurements for clusters of galaxies using the X-ray and the\nlensing techniques. Miralda-Esqud\u00e9 & Babul (1995) reported a discrepancy by a factor of \u223c 2\nbetween the X-ray and the strong-lensing mass determinations for A1689 and A2218. Wu &\nFang (1997) concluded that the mass measurements from the velocity dispersion of optical\ngalaxies and the strong-lensing data were generally in good agreement but were typically a\n1\n\n\ffactor 2\u20133 larger than those from the X-ray data. In contrast to this, the comparison of the\nweak lensing and the X-ray mass measurements at cluster's outer regions has inferred good\nagreement between them (e.g. Squires et al. 1996; Smail et al. 1997). These facts show that\nthe isothermal \u03b2 model widely used in the X-ray data analyses is useful preferably only in the\nouter region of each cluster.\nIt is therefore inebitable to modify the model of intracluster gas distribution in order to\nresolve the discrepancy between the X-ray and the strong-lensing mass measurements. The\ndouble \u03b2 model of Xue & Wu (2000) is a possible one. However, as shown by themselves, the\ncorrection by the double \u03b2 model is still insufficient to resolve the discrepancy. In addition,\nthe physical foundation of the double \u03b2 model is unclear, and the mathematical formulas to\nreconstruct the actual form of gas distribution are fairly tangled and unphysical. For example,\nthe restored gas distribution is not a simple superposition of two separated components. Models\nof intracluster gas distribution based on the NFW model of dark matter halo having central cusp\n(Navarro, Frenk & White 1996, 1997; Moore et al. 1999) or on the purely phenomenological\ndark matter density distribution with no central cusp (Burkert 1995) are suitable only for\nindividually limited types of clusters. Such a state of things demands us to establish a new\npowerfull model of intracluster gas distribution, on the basis of firm physical foundations, which\ncan resolve these problems all at once.\nIn this paper, we propose a new type of \u03b2 model of intracluster gas distribution in Section\n2. Then we determine the parameter values of our model best fitted to observed X-ray surface\nbrightness profiles of three clusters of galaxies and compare them with the results obtained by\nusing the conventional isothermal \u03b2 model in Section 3. The good agreement between the X-ray\nand the gravitational lensing mass measurements based on our new model is also shown there.\nIn Section 4 we discuss the new features of clusters of galaxies on the basis of our model. Brief\ncomments are also given on the works based on other influential models. Finally, the present\nresults are summarized in Section 5.\nInstead of the recent WMAP results showing the existence of non-zero \u039b (\u03a9\u039b = 0.73 \u00b1 0.04)\nand the value of H0 = 72 \u00b1 5 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 (e.g. Bennett et al. 2003; Spergel et al. 2003), we\nassume an Einstein-de Sitter (\u03a9M = 1.0, \u03a9\u039b = 0.0) model of the universe and adopt a Hubble\nconstant of H0 = 50 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 in this paper, except for Section 4, in order to make it easy\nto compare the present results with many previous works which used those old cosmological\nparameter values.\n\n2. Theoretical Foundations\nHere we outline the theoretical basis for making up the model function of the intracluster gas\ndistribution and check in detail the general properties of the conventional isothermal \u03b2 model.\nThen we establish a new type of model of intracluster gas distribution, which is expected to be\nmore physical and more practical than the isothermal \u03b2 model.\n2.1 Basic relations\nThe standard model of mass distribution in clusters of galaxies assumes that both gas and\n\n2\n\n\fdark matter are in hydrostatic equilibrium within the cluster potential. That is,\n1 dP (r)\nM(r)\n= \u2212G 2 ,\n\u03c1g (r) dr\nr\n\n(1)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, r is the three-dimensional distance from the cluster\ncenter, and \u03c1g (r), P (r) and M(r) are the intracluster gas density, pressure, and the total\nmass (including dark matter) within the radius r, respectively. The equation of state for the\nintracluster gas is\nP (r) =\n\n\u03c1g (r)\nkB Tg (r),\n\u03bcmH\n\n(2)\n\nwhere mH , kB , \u03bc and Tg (r) are the hydrogen mass, the Boltzmann constant, the mean molecular\nweight and the temperature of intracluster gas at r, respectively. From Equations (1) and (2)\nwe obtain\n\u0012\n\u0013\nkB Tg (r)r d ln \u03c1g (r) d ln Tg (r)\n.\n(3)\n+\nM(r) = \u2212\nG\u03bc mH\nd ln r\nd ln r\nThis expression is available in good approximation even when a radial flow of intracluster\ngas exists, so long as the flow velocity is much less than the thermal velocity of gas particles\n(Miyoshi 1994).\nOn the other hand, the collisionless dark matter particles satisfy the following relation (e.g.\nBinny & Tremaine 1994, hereafter BT)\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 d(\u03c1DM (r)\u03c3r2 (r))\n1 2\n2\nM(r)\n2\n\u03c3r (r) \u2212 \u03c3t (r) = \u2212G 2 ,\n+\n(4)\n\u03c1DM (r)\ndr\nr\n2\nr\nwhere \u03c3r2 (r) and \u03c3t2 (r) are the radial and the tangential (perpendicular to the radial component)\nvelocity dispersions, and \u03c1DM (r) is the dark matter density. Equation (4) gives\n\u0012\n\u0013\nr\u03c3r2 (r) d ln \u03c1DM (r)\nd ln \u03c3r (r)\nM(r) = \u2212\n+2\n+ 2A(r) ,\n(5)\nG\nd ln r\nd ln r\nwhere A(r) \u2261 1 \u2212 \u03c3t2 (r)/2\u03c3r2 (r) indicates the degree of anisotropy in the velocity distribution\nof dark matter. From Equations (3) and (5) we can introduce a parameter \u03b2 defined by\nd ln \u03c1g d ln Tg\n+\n\u03c3r2\nd ln r\nd ln r\n.\n=\n\u03b2\u2261\nkB Tg\nd ln \u03c1DM\nd\nln\n\u03c3r + 2A\n+\n2\n\u03bcmH\nd ln r\nd ln r\n\n(6)\n\nWhen the intracluster gas is isothermal and the dark matter velocity dispersion is isotropic and\nr-independent, that is,\nd ln Tg\nd ln \u03c3r\n=\n= A = 0,\nd ln r\nd ln r\n\n(7)\n\nd ln \u03c1g (r)\nd ln \u03c1DM (r)\n=\u03b2\n.\nd ln r\nd ln r\n\n(8)\n\nEquation (6) is reduced to\n\n3\n\n\fThis is equivalent to\n\u03c1g (r) \u221d \u03c1\u03b2DM (r).\n\n(9)\n\nIt should be noted here that Expression (9) is still valid in good approximation even if A, Tg\nand \u03c3r are r-dependent, so long as the following inequalities hold\n\nd ln \u03c1g\nd ln Tg\n\u226a\n,\nd ln r\nd ln r\n\nd ln \u03c3r\nd ln \u03c1DM\n.\n+A \u226a\nd ln r\nd ln r\n\n(10)\n\n2.2 Isothermal \u03b2 model\nWhen the density distribution of dark matter is assumed to have the same form as the\nasymptotic density distribution of self-gravitaing isothermal gas sphere,\n\u03c1DM (r) \u221d [1 + (r/a)2]\u22123/2 ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhich is fairly well fitted to the galaxy distribution in clusters of galaxies (King 1972), Expression (9) gives the isothermal \u03b2 model of intracluster gas distribution (Cavaliere & Fusco-Femiano\n1978; Jones & Forman 1984)\n3\n\n\u03c1g (r) = \u03c1g (0)[1 + (r/a)2]\u2212 2 \u03b2 ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u03c1g (0) is the central gas density and a is the core radius. If the intracluster gas is\nisothermal and the radial gas density distribution is of the form of Equation (12), the X-ray\nsurface brightness distribution which is proportional to the integral of \u03c12g (r) along the line of\nsight has the functional form of\n1\n\nS(R) = S(0)[1 + (R/a)2 ] 2 \u22123\u03b2 ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere S(0) is the central surface brightness and R is the projected radial distance from the\ncluster center on the sky plane. Many clusters, however, are not adequately described their Xray surface brightness profiles by this model but show some central excesses. Fabian & Nulsen\n(1977) and Jones & Forman (1984) interpreted these central excesses as being due to the cooling\nflow of intraclusterpgas. The principle of their idea is as follows. Since the X-ray emissivity\nis proportional to Tg \u03c12g , the lower gas temperature yields the higher X-ray emissivity, when\nthe gas pressure Tg \u03c1g remains unchanged. The last condition is required to keep the balance\nbetween the pressure gradient and the gravitational force.\nHere we have to remember that the density profile of self-gravitating isothermal gas sphere\nwith a finite value at the center has a central hump in general (see e.g. BT). The X-ray\nsurface brightness profile simulated using this solution also has a central hump, in contrast to\nthe isothermal \u03b2 model. It is therefore probable that the central excess in the X-ray surface\nbrightness profile remained in the fitting with the isothermal \u03b2 model might be mostly no\n4\n\n\fmore than a ghost. Accordingly the central excess does not necessarily mean the existence\nof cooling flow. Besides, the cooling flow model cannot resolve the discrepancy between the\nlensing and the X-ray mass measurements mentioned in Section 1. Because, the cooling flow\nmodel requires only the enhancement of gas in the central region, and the total mass density\ndistribution (mostly due to dark matter) remains almost unchanged.\nThese facts strongly provoke us to make up a new model function of \u03c1DM (r), and therefore\n\u03c1g (r) through Expression (9), which is expected to make clear the vagueness concerned with\nthe central excess as well as to resolve the discrepancy between the X-ray and the lensing mass\nmeasurements.\n2.3 The new model we propose here\nHere we propose a new model function of \u03c1g (r) obtained from Expression (9) by using exact\nKing models for \u03c1DM (r), which is well fitted to the observed X-ray data as shown below.\nIt is well known that the stellar distributions in globular clusters and elliptical galaxies are\nvery well described by King models (Michie 1963; Michie & Bodenheimer 1963; King 1966,\n1981) defined by\nr\n\u0012\n\u0013\np\n\u03c1(r)\n4\u03a8(r)\n2\u03a8(r)\n\u03a8(r)/\u03c32\n=e\nerf ( \u03a8(r)/\u03c3) \u2212\n1+\n,\n(14)\n\u03c11\n\u03c0\u03c3 2\n3\u03c3 2\n\nwhere \u03c11 is a normalization factor, \u03c3 is a constant of the order of the dispersion velocity,\nerf (x) is the error function defined by\nZ x\n2\n2\ne\u2212t dt,\n(15)\nerf (x) = \u221a\n\u03c0 0\n\nand \u03a8(r) is a solution of the following Poisson equation\nr\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\np\n4\u03a8(r)\n2\u03a8(r)\nd\n1\n2 d\u03a8(r)\n\u03a8(r)/\u03c32\nr\n= \u2212e\nerf ( \u03a8(r)/\u03c3) +\n1+\n.

The boundary condition\nadopted here is d\u03a8\u0303/dr\u0303 = 0 at r\u0303 = 0. The density profiles thus obtained for finite values of\n5\n\n\f\u03a8\u03030 = 12, 9, 6, and 3 and their projected density profiles are shown in Fig. 4-9 of BT, each of\nwhich shows a central hump more noticeable for larger values of \u03a8\u03030 . The dispersion velocities\nfor these solutions are nearly constant in the central region and gradually decrease with r in\nthe outer region (see Fig. 4 -11 of BT). Expression (10), the condition required for the validity\nof Equation (9), is therefore well satisfied.\nWe can construct a new model of intracluster gas density \u03c1g (r) from Equation (9) by substituting the solution \u03c1(r) of Equation (14) for \u03c1DM (r). This model is necessarily expected to\nhave a central hump and therefore to yield some central excess in the X-ray surface brightness\ndistribution when fitted by the isothermal \u03b2 model. The X-ray surface brightness is proportional to S(R), the integral of \u03c12g (r) along the line of sight. In Fig. 1 we plot S(R) simulated for\nour models of \u03a8\u03030 = 12, 9, 6, and 3 in case of \u03b2 = 1.0. The expected central humps are clearly\nseen for large values of \u03a8\u03030 . In the limit of \u03a8\u03030 \u2192 \u221e, S(R) converges to one for the isothermal\nsphere, i.e. S(R) \u221d R\u22123 at large R.\nAs was pointed out by Cavaliere & Fusco-Femiano (1978), the exact equilibrium solution\ncan be obtained by solving the full Poisson equation containing the total (dark matter plus\nbaryonic matter) density. In our model, however, the Poisson equation (16) or (18) includes\ndark matter only. That is, the gas (baryonic matter) density is not included in the right hand\nside of these equations. Gas particles are distributed in the gravitational potential made up\nby dark matter. In addition, there is no foundation on which the validity of Equation (7) is\nsupported, and only the observational data suggest the validity of the conditions described\nin Expression (10). Therefore, Equation (9) should be still considered to be an approximated\nmodel of real intracluster gas distribution. Nevertheless, the agreement between our new model\nand the actual intracluster gas density profile is expected to be considerably improved in comparison with the isothermal \u03b2 model. Because, the fractional mass content of dark matter is\noverwhelming there and the gravitational field within each cluster is practically governed by\ndark matter.\n\n3. Comparison with Observations\nWe present here the results of fitting our model to the observed X-ray data of three clusters\nof galaxies, A 383 (Smith et al. 2001), A 2163 (Elbaz, Arnaud & B\u00f6hringer 1995) and A 2390\n(B\u00f6hringer et al. 1998), compared with the results of fitting by the isothermal \u03b2 model. A 383\nand A 2390 are classified in cD clusters, but A 2163 is not. This cluster is classified in the Abell\nrichness class 2. Since giant arcs are observed in the central regions of these clusters, we can also\ncompare their projected masses, Mproj , the integral of the mass density obtained from X-ray\ndata along the line of sight within the arc radius, with their (strong) lensing masses, Mlens . The\nstrong-lensing masses of A 383 and A 2390 are obtained from Smith et al. (2001) and Pierre\net al. (1966), respectively. For A 2163, the strong-lensing mass determined by assuming the\narcs lie at the Einstein radius is 4 \u00d7 1013 M\u2299 , but this value exceeds the weak-lensing masses\nobtained at some outer radii (see Fig. 2 of Squires et al. 1997). Therefore we adopt for Mlens\nthe value of weak-lensing mass estimated by extrapolation from outer radii. For the intracluster gas temperature of A 383, Smith et al. (2001) adopted the value of Tg = 7.1 (\u00b1 2) keV\nestimated from the cooling-flow-corrected cluster TX -LBol relation obtained by Allen & Fabian\n6\n\n\f(1998). The use of thus obtained value of Tg is, however, not suitable for our analysis because\nof the large error bars accompanied with the relation. The archived Chandra data of this cluster yield the emission-weighted mean temperature to be 3.5 \u00b1 0.2 keV and 5.2+0.2\n\u22120.6 keV for the\n\u2032\u2032\ncentral (\u03b8R \u2264 15 , where \u03b8R is the angular distance from the cluster centre) and surrounding\n(15\u2032\u2032 \u2264 \u03b8R \u2264 120\u2032\u2032) regions, respectively (Furuzawa 2002). We adopt the value of Tg = 4.0 keV\nfor the present analysis. The observed redshifts (z), the gas temperature (Tg ), the projected\ndistance of giant arc from the cluster center (Rarc ), and the lensing mass (Mlens ) of each sample\ncluster, we adopted for the present analysis, are given in Table 1.\nIn Figs. 2\u20134 we plot the results of fitting for our model and the isothermal \u03b2 model to the\nobserved X-ray surface brightness profiles of these clusters. The best-fit values of model parameters and the resultant Mproj /Mlens ratios for the two models are summarized in Table 2,\nin which the projected mass obtained from the isothermal \u03b2 model is indicated by MIT,proj .\nThe agreement between our model with best-fit parameter values and the observations is very\nsatisfactory for all the sample clusters aside from their outermost regions. The differences\nbetween the model curve and data points are much less than the statistical errors for A 383\nand A 2390. Thus our model is in general much more suitable to reproduce the X-ray surface\nbrightness profile of galaxy cluster than the isothermal \u03b2 model, except for outermost regions.\nSince the disagreement between our model and observed X-ray profiles in the outermost region\nis considered to be due to the employment of the King model, which describes a completely\nisolated system whose matter density becomes zero at a finete radius, it will disappear if the\ninfall of matter from the outer (intercluster) space is taken into account.\n\n4. Discussion\nAs shown above, our model is well fitted to the X-ray surface brightness profile except for\noutermost region. The fit is satisfactory even when the fit by the isothermal \u03b2 model remains\na large central excess (A 383 and A 2390). It should be noted here that our new model is well\nfitted to observed results for all of the sample clusters of galaxies (including both cD and noncD types). The agreement between Mproj and Mlens also looks like complete. The central mass\nconcentration in our model is high enough to resolve the discrepancy between X-ray and lensing\nmass measurements. The ratio of the projected mass obtained using our model to the lensing\nmass is ranging from 0.92 to 1.06 for the three sample clusters, while the ratio obtained using\nthe isothermal model ranges from 0.46 to 0.94 (see Table 2). This shows the predominance\nof our model over the isothermal \u03b2 model. The agreement between Mproj and Mlens would\nbe improved if we take into account the infall of matter from the intercluster space. Since\nour model is based on firm physical foundations, these facts suggest that most of the 'central\nexcess' of the X-ray surface brightness obtained so far would probably be no more than a ghost\nembossed by the use of inadequate model function. Therefore the central excess should not be\ndirectly linked to the cooling flow.\nTable 2 gives \u03b2 = 0.53 \u00b1 0.08 and 0.63 \u00b1 0.02 for our model and the isothermal \u03b2 model,\nrespectively. If the velocity dispersion of intracluster dark matter is isotropic and if the intracluster gas has experienced no non-gravitational heating, \u03b2 should not be less than unity\nbecause of the intracluster gas cooling by X-ray emissions (see Equation (6)). Therefore, the\n7\n\n\fvalues of \u03b2 (our model) \u223c 0.5 obtained here support the theory of non-gravitational intracluster\ngas heatings comparable to those reached through gravitational collapse (Kaiser 1966; Evrard\n& Henry 1991; Ponman, Cannon & Navarro 1999). The large value of \u03b2 (our model) for A 2163\nis supposed to show the existence of some collective motions of intracluster gas. Indeed this\ncluster is not relaxed but just in the process of formation (Squires et al. 1997).\nSo far we estimated the sizes and masses of sample clusters by assuming an Einstein-de\nSitter (\u03a9M = 1.0, \u03a9\u039b = 0.0) model of the universe for the convenience of the comparison of our\nresults with other previous works. Here we consider the more realistic \u03a9M = 0.3 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.7\ncosmology too. Because, the r-dependence of the infalling matter density is sensitive to the\nvalue of \u03a9M . Gunn & Gott III (1972) have calculated the infall of matter into the Coma cluster\nusing the top hat model. Their calculations show that the infalling matter density varies as\n\u03c1 \u221d r \u22121.67 for \u03a9M = 2.0, \u221d r \u22121.55 for \u03a9M = 0.5, and \u221d r \u22121.5 for \u03a9M = 0.2. Accordingly\nwe adopt \u03c1 \u221d r \u22121.52 for \u03a9M = 0.3, which gives the integral of the square of infalling matter\ndensity along the line of sight varying as R1\u22122\u00d71.52 = R\u22122.04 . It is noted here that this Rdependence will be valid for both of dark and baryonic matter particles, because the influence\nof gas pressure is negligible at the outermost region. In order to see the actual R-dependence\nat large R (outer region) it is convenient to use the results of fit using the ispthermal \u03b2 model,\nwhich gives S(R) \u221d R1\u22126\u03b2 there. The exponent \u20132.04 of R corresponds to the value of \u03b2 = 0.51\nof the isothermal \u03b2 model. This value is less than the observed mean value of \u03b2 (isothermal)\nobtained here for the sample clusters and the mean value for 33 clusters (by the single \u03b2 fit),\n< \u03b2 >= 0.61 \u00b10.09 obtained by Xue & Wu (2000). These facts show that the matter density at\ncluster's outer region decreases with r more rapidly than estimated by the top hat model. This\nimplies that the matter density in the space surrounding each cluster is fairly lower than the\ntheoretically estimated intercluster mean matter density, probably due to the infall of matter\ntowards each cluster over a long time. The recent discovery of a completely empty void of\n\u223c 140 Mpc radius (Rudnick et al. 2007) seems to support this point of view.\nAs was mentioned in Subsection 2.1, Expression (9) is available even if A, Tg and \u03c3r are\nr-dependent so long as Expression (10) holds. In such a case, however, \u03b2 would not have\na constant value throughout a cluster, because Tg and \u03c3r are expected to have different rdependences in general. Now, from the Chandra or XMM-Newton observations, all of the\nsample clusters are found to have the gas temperature descent in the central region. The rates\nof temperature descent are respectively \u223c 20% for A 383 (Furuzawa 2002), \u223c 30% for A 2163\n(Markevitch & Vikhlinin 2001) and \u223c 50% for A 2390 (Allen, Ettori & Fabian 2001). For each\nof these sample clusters, however, a very good fit of our model to the observed X-ray profile is\nobtained for r-independent values of Tg and \u03b2. Probably, the small change in the X-ray surface\nbrightness caused by the gas temperature descent and the contributions of cD galaxy (when it\nexists) in the central region might be well compensated by a little but suitable adjustment for\nthe best-fit values of \u03a8\u03030 and \u03b2. The parameter values compiled in Table 2 should therefore be\nunderstood as averaged over the whole system of each cluster.\nAccording to an attempt to derive the intracluster gas distribution embedded in a dark\nmatter halo with an NFW density profile (Makino, Sasaki & Suto 1998), the obtained gas\ndensity profile is well approximated by the conventional \u03b2 model (see also Suto, Sasaki &\nMakino 1998; Wu & Chiueh 2001; Wu & Xue 2000). In contrast to our model, however, some\nextra component is needed in case of the NFW dark halo to reproduce the central excess in\nthe X-ray surface brightness distribution. The basic difference between our model and the\n8\n\n\fmodels based on the NFW model is focused on whether or not the central cusp exists for the\ndark matter distribution. This problem is still unsettled, and more detailed theoretical and\nobservational studies are needed to bring this problem to an end.\nAguirre, Schaye & Quataert (2001) and Sanders (2003) have tried to reproduce the observed\ndistribution of intracluster gas on the basis of the modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND, Milgrom 1983a, b, c) and showed that some additional dark matter component is still needed to get\na good agreement between the modelled and observed results, especially in the central region of\ncluster. That is, the problem of the enhanced central mass concentration in clusters of galaxies\nis in principle separated from that concerning the validity of MOND.\n\n5. Conclusions\nA new model of intracluster gas distribution is established here. It is a new type of \u03b2 model\nwell fitted to the X-ray surface brightness profile except for outermost region of each cluster.\nThe little gap between the modelled and observed X-ray surface profiles would disappear if the\ninfall of matter from the intercluster space is taken into account. The fitting is satisfactory\neven when the X-ray surface brightness profile fitted to the isothermal \u03b2 model remains a large\ncentral excess. The enhanced central mass concentration in our model is almost high enough to\nresolve the discrepancy between the X-ray and the gravitational lensing mass measurements. A\nlittle sink of the modelled X-ray surface brightness at the outermost region in our model would\ndisappear if the infall of matter from the intercluster space is taken into account. These facts\nsuggests that the central excess might be no more than a ghost embossed by an inadequate\nfitting and that the central excess should not be directly connected to the existence of cooling\nflow.\nThe values of \u03b2 (our model) \u223c 0.5 obtained here support the theory of non-gravitational\nintracluster gas heatings comparable to those reached through gravitational collapse. On the\nother hand, the value of \u03b2 \u223c 0.6 obtained for the isothermal \u03b2 model is explained as showing\nthe scarcity of matter in the space surrounding each cluster, probably due to the infall of matter\ntowards it over a long time.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported in part by the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) of Japan\nSociety for the Promotion of Science (No. 14540230).
