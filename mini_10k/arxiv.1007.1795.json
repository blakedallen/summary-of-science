Duality from Quantization\nWhat is quantum gravity ? This question would be one of the most difficult questions\nwe have ever faced. Quantum gravity naively means to \"quantize\" a Riemannian\nmanifold since, according to the general relativity, gravity is the dynamics of spacetime geometry where spacetime is a Riemannian manifold and the gravitational field\nis represented by a Riemannian metric. But we are still vague how to \"quantize\"\nthe Riemannian manifold.\nMathematically, in order to define the quantization of a dynamical system, it is\nnecessary to first specify an underlying Poisson structure of the dynamical system.1\nThe dynamical system will be described by a Poisson manifold (M, \u03b8) where M is a\ndifferentiable manifold whose local coordinates are denoted by xA (A = 1, * * * , N =\ndim(M )) and the Poisson structure\n\u03b8=\n\nN\n\u2202\n\u2202\n1 X AB\n\u2208 \u0393(\u22272 T M )\n\u03b8 (x) A \u2227\n2\n\u2202x\n\u2202xB\n\n(1)\n\nA,B=1\n\nis a (not necessarily nondegenerate) bivector field.

A Poisson manifold appears as a natural generalization of symplectic manifolds where the Poisson structure \u03b8 reduces to a symplectic structure if\n\u03b8 is nongenerate.1\nFormally, the quantization, especially the canonical quantization where \u03b8AB in\nEq.(1) is a nondegenerate constant matrix, can be done by associating to a commutative algebra C \u221e (M ) of smooth functions, a noncommutative algebra A\u03b8 of linear\noperators acting on a suitable Hilbert space H. That is, the dynamical variables\nf, g \u2208 C \u221e (M ) in a classical system are replaced by self-adjoint operators fb, gb \u2208 A\u03b8\nacting on H and the Poisson bracket (2) is replaced by a quantum bracket\n{f, g}\u03b8 \u2192 \u2212i[fb, gb].\n\n(5)\n\n[b\nxA , x\nbB ] = i\u03b8AB .\n\n(6)\n\n[xi , pj ] = i~\u03b4ji .\n\n(7)\n\nThis completes the quantization of the dynamical system whose phase space M now\nbecomes noncommutative, i.e.\n\nNote that the detailed structure of Poisson manifold (M, \u03b8) depends on what\nkind of dynamical system we consider. A prominent example is the mechanical\nsystem of classical particles where M is the particle phase space with coordinates\nP \u2202\n\u2202\n(xi , pi ) and the Poisson structure \u03b8 = ~ i \u2202x\ni \u2227 \u2202p . Here, we intentionally inserted\ni\nthe Planck constant ~ into \u03b8 to emphasize that the deformation (quantization)\nparameter ~ carries the physical dimension of length times momentum, i.e., (x\u00d7p) so\nthat \u03b8 is dimensionless. In this case, the quantization (5) defines quantum mechanics\nas we know very well and the particle phase space M is now noncommutative, i.e.\n\nA classical field theory is a generalization of finite-dimensional particle system to\nan infinite-dimensional system where particles are described by several continuous\nfunctions \u03c6a (x, t) \u2208 C \u221e (R3,1 ) defined on spacetime R3,1 and their conjugate variables \u03c0 a (x, t) \u2208 C \u221e (R3,1 ) where the index a = 1, * * * , n denotes internal degrees of\nfreedom. In this case, the corresponding Poisson structure is defined by\nn Z\nX\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\n\u2227 a\n(8)\n\u03b8=~\na (x)\n\u03b4\u03c6\n\u03b4\u03c0\n(x)\na=1 \u03a3\nwhere \u03a3 = R3 is a spacelike hypersurface in spacetime.

The\ncanonical quantization (5) for the Poisson bracket (9) leads to quantized fields, e.g.,\n[\u03c6a (x), \u03c0 b (y)] = i~\u03b4 ab \u03b4 3 (x \u2212 y).\n\n(10)\n\nQuantum field theory is therefore defined by quantizing an infinite-dimensional\nPoisson manifold (P, \u03b8) in terms of ~ again, as we clearly know.\nNow consider to \"quantize\" gravity. First we have to carefully contemplate about\nwhat is the dynamical system for gravity we want to quantize. To lift the veil, it is\nnecessary to clearly pin down what is the underlying Poisson manifold (M, \u03b8) for\nquantum gravity. Note that gravity describes the dynamics of spacetime geometry\nand it is characterized by its own intrinsic scale given by the Newton constant\nG = L2P where classical gravity corresponds to G \u2192 0 limit.a Furthermore, since\nthe gravitational constant G = L2P carries the physical dimension of (length)2 in\nnatural unit, the Newton constant G, as will be seen soon, actually signifies an\nintrinsic Poisson structure of spacetime\n\u03b8=\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\n\u03b8 (y) \u03bc \u2227 \u03bd \u2208 \u0393(\u22272 T M ).\n2\n\u2202y\n\u2202y\n\n(11)\n\nTherefore, it should be reasonable to ponder on the possibility that the quantum\ngravity is defined by quantizing spacetime itself in terms of G instead of ~. In other\nwords, quantum gravity may be defined by the Poisson manifold (M, \u03b8), where M\nis a spacetime manifold with the Poisson structure (11).2,3\nCustomarily, we have taken the same route to the quantization of gravity as the\nconventional quantum field theory. To be precise, basic phase space variables for\ncanonical quantum gravity are defined by a spatial metric gij (x) \u2208 C \u221e (\u03a3) defined\non a spacelike hypersurface \u03a3 \u2248 R3 and the canonically conjugate variable \u03c0 ij (x) \u2208\nC \u221e (\u03a3) together with Hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constraints. That is, the\nbasic Poisson manifold (P, \u03b8) is defined by (gij (x), \u03c0 ij (x)) \u2208 P with the Poisson\nstructure (8) where a = (ij). Thus, the conventional quantum gravity also intends to\nquantize an infinite-dimensional particle (graviton) phase space associated with the\nmetric field g\u03bc\u03bd (x) (or its variants such as the Ashtekar variables or spin networks) of\nRiemannian geometry. This quantization scheme is very different from the quantum\ngravity defined with the Poisson structure (11) because the quantization of Poisson\nmanifold (P, \u03b8) is to quantize a particle (graviton) phase space P in terms of ~\nwhile the quantization of Poisson manifold (M, \u03b8) is to quantize spacetime M itself\nin terms of the Newton constant G.3\nNow we have to understand what is the origin of the spacetime Poisson structure (11) and what is the relation between Poisson geometry (M, \u03b8) and Einstein\na Nevertheless,\n\ngravitational phenomena are ubiquitous in our everyday life. The reason is that the\ngravitational force is only attractive and so always additive. As a result, the standard gravitational\nparameter GM for an astronomical body with mass M is not small. For example, GMe = 4 \u00d7\n24\n1014 m3 /s2 for the Earth\n\u221a where Me = 5.96 \u00d7 10 kg, which corresponds to 1 cm compared to the\nPlanck length LP = G \u223c 10\u221233 cm.\n\n\fAugust 17, 2018 11:43 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n4\n\nreview-mpla\n\nHyun Seok Yang\n\ngravity or Riemannian geometry (M, g). It is well-known that the union of three\n\"fundamental\" constants in Nature, the Planck constant ~ in quantum mechanics,\nthe universal velocity c in relativity, and the Newton constant G in gravity, uniquely\nfixes characteristic scales for quantum gravity:\nr\nc~\n= 2.2 \u00d7 10\u22125 g,\nMP =\nG\nr\nG~\n= 1.6 \u00d7 10\u221233 cm,\n(12)\nLP =\nc3\nr\nG~\nTP =\n= 5.4 \u00d7 10\u221244 s.\nc5\nAnd it is believed that in the Planck scale LP spacetime is no longer commuting\nbut becomes noncommutative, i.e.\n[y \u03bc , y \u03bd ] = i\u03b8\u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(13)\n\nNote that the noncommutative spacetime (13) arises from the quantization (5) with\nthe Poisson structure (11) like as in Eq.(6). In general, if spacetime M supports a\nPoisson structure such as (11), the algebra C \u221e (M ) of smooth functions defined on\nthe spacetime M becomes a Lie algebra under the Poisson bracket1\n{f, g}\u03b8 (y) = \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd (y)\n\n\u2202f (y) \u2202g(y)\n,\n\u2202y \u03bc \u2202y \u03bd\n\n(f, g) \u2208 C \u221e (M ).\n\n(14)\n\nIn the case where \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd is a constant matrix of rank 2n, we can apply the same\ncanonical quantization to the Poisson manifold (M, \u03b8). We can associate to a commutative algebra (C \u221e (M ), {\u2212, \u2212}\u03b8 ) of smooth functions defined on the spacetime\nM , a noncommutative algebra A\u03b8 of linear operators on a suitable Hilbert space\nH. That is, the smooth functions f, g \u2208 C \u221e (M ) become noncommutative operators\n(fields) fb, gb \u2208 A\u03b8 acting on H and the Poisson bracket (14) is replaced by a noncommutative bracket [fb, gb] \u2208 A\u03b8 .4,5 As a result, spacetime becomes noncommutative\nafter the quantization and satisfies the Heisenberg algebra (13).\nTherefore, we understand that spacetime admits the intrinsic Poisson structure\n(11) as long as spacetime at a microscopic world is noncommutative. Now the pith\nand marrow of quantum gravity is to understand how to derive a Riemannian geometry (M, g) from a Poisson geometry (M, \u03b8) of spacetime. Because quantization\nin general introduces a new kind of duality between physical or mathematical entities, the question is what kind of duality arises from the quantization (13) of\nspacetime itself. Recall that the quantization (7) of particle phase space introduces\nthe wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics.

What is a duality resulting from this inner automorphism ?\nFirst, let us expose that the noncommutative spactime (13) introduces a new\nkind of duality between gauge theory and gravity.6,7,8,9 In order to illuminate the\nissue in a broad context, let us return to the system (12) of physical constants.\nWe believe that all the four interactions in Nature, gravitational, electromagnetic,\nweak and strong forces, will be unified into a single force at the Planck scale (12).\nSo it may be more natural to treat gauge theory on an equal footing with gravity\nin the system (12) which is missing the gauge theory counterpart. For the reason,\nconsider the quartet of physical constants by adding a coupling constant e which is\nthe electric charge but sometimes it will be denoted with gY M to refer to a general\ngauge coupling constant. Using the symbol L for length, T for time, M for mass, and\nwriting [X] for the dimensions of some physical quantity X, we have the following\nin D dimensions\n[~] = M L2 T \u22121 ,\n[e2 ] = M LD\u22121 T \u22122 ,\n\n[c] = LT \u22121 ,\n[G] = M \u22121 LD\u22121 T \u22122 .\n\n(18)\n\nA remarkable point of the system (18) is that it specifies the following intrinsic\nscales independently of dimensions 3 :\nM2 =\n\nh e2 i\n,\nG\n\nL2 =\n\nh G~2 i\ne 2 c2\n\n,\n\nT2 =\n\nh G~2 i\n.\ne 2 c4\n\n(19)\n\nFrom the four dimensional case where e2 /~c \u2248 1/137, we can see that the scales in\n(19) are not so different from the Planck scales in (12).\nNote that the first relation GM 2 = e2 in (19) implies that at the mass scale\nM the gravitational and electromagnetic interactions become of equal strength.\nThen, the length L in Eq.(19) is the Compton wavelength of mass M where the\ngravitational and electromagnetic interactions have the same strength, which turns\nout to be the scale of spacetime noncommutativity where the conspiracy between\ngravity and gauge theory takes place. Suppose that a gauge theory whose coupling\nconstant is given by e is defined in the noncommutative spacetime (13). In this\ncase, the noncommutative gauge theory bears an intrinsic length scale given by\nL2 = |\u03b8| and then the quartet system (19) implies that the Newton constant G can\n\n\fAugust 17, 2018 11:43 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n6\n\nreview-mpla\n\nHyun Seok Yang\n\nbe determined by field theory parameters only, i.e.2\nG~2\n\u223c e2 |\u03b8|,\nc2\n\n(20)\n\nhinting an intimate correspondence between gravity and gauge theory.b This novel\nduality in noncommutative spacetime will be clarified in the next section.\n2. Symplectization of Spacetime Geometry\nWe have speculated in the previous section that, if spacetime M admits a Poisson\nstructure such as (11), there will be a novel duality between Riemannian geometry\n(M, g) and Poisson geometry (M, \u03b8). Now we will briefly sketch how this remarkable\nduality can be true. We refer to Ref. 2 and a recent review3 for a full exposition.\nSee also Refs. 10, 11 and references therein for related discussions.\nTo simplify the argument,c let us assume that the Poisson structure \u03b8 : T \u2217 M \u2192\nT M in (11) is nondegenerate at any point y \u2208 M . Then, we can invert this map to\nobtain the map \u03b8\u22121 \u2261 B : T M \u2192 T \u2217 M , which is called a symplectic structure of M ,\ni.e., a nondegenerate closed 2-form, dB = 0, in \u0393(\u22272 T \u2217 M ). The pair (M, \u03c90 = B)\nis called a symplectic manifold. Now consider an arbitrary deformation of the symplectic geometry (M, B) by adding an arbitrary 2-form F \u2208 \u0393(\u22272 T \u2217 M ) such that\n\u03c91 = B + F . But we will require that the resulting geometry after the deformation is still symplectic, i.e. dF = 0. Then, according to the Poincar\u00e9 lemma, the\nclosed 2-form F can locally be written as F = dA where A \u2208 \u0393(T \u2217 M ) is an arbitrary one-form. Because the original symplectic structure B is a nondegenerate and\nclosed 2-form, the associated map B : T M \u2192 T \u2217 M is a vector bundle isomorphism.\nTherefore, there exists a natural pairing \u0393(T M ) \u2192 \u0393(T \u2217 M ) : X 7\u2192 B(X) = \u03b9X B\nbetween C \u221e -sections of tangent and cotangent bundles. Note that X \u2208 \u0393(T M )\nis an arbitrary vector field so that \u03b9X B is an arbitrary one-form for a given B.\nTherefore, we can identify\nA = \u2212\u03b9X B\n\n(21)\n\nand so F = dA = \u2212(d\u03b9X +\u03b9X d)B = \u2212LX B where LX = d\u03b9X +\u03b9X d is the Lie derivative along the flow of a vector field X. To conclude, the deformation of symplectic\ngeometry (M, B) in terms of an arbitrary closed 2-form F can be represented as\n\u03c91 = B \u2212 LX B = (1 \u2212 LX )\u03c90 .\n\n(22)\n\nb The relation (20) would be an analogue of the de Broglie relation \u03bb = 2\u03c0~ for the wave-particle\np\nduality. The de Broglie relation is possible because quantum mechanics has a conversion factor ~\nwith the physical dimension of length times momentum. Likewise, if spacetime is noncommutative\nand so the theory equips with a dimensionful parameter |\u03b8| of (length)2 , the relation (20) shows\nthat the gravitational interaction can be inherited from a gauge field interaction, so leading to the\ngauge/gravity duality.\nc For all mathematical details in this section, we refer to Ref. 1.\n\n\fAugust 17, 2018 11:43 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\nreview-mpla\n\nEmergent Geometry and Quantum Gravity\n\n7\n\nThe result (22) shows that a smooth family \u03c9t = \u03c90 + t(\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c90 ) of symplectic\nstructures joining \u03c90 to \u03c91 is all deformation-equivalent and there exists a map\n\u03c6 : M \u00d7 R \u2192 M as a flow \u2013 a one-parameter family of diffeomorphisms \u2013 generated\nby the vector field Xt satisfying \u03b9Xt \u03c9t + A = 0 such that \u03c6\u2217t (\u03c9t ) = \u03c90 for all\n0 \u2264 t \u2264 1. This can be explicitly checked by considering a local Darboux chart\n(U ; y 1 , * * * , y 2n ) centered at p \u2208 U and valid on an open neighborhood U \u2282 M\nsuch that \u03c90 |U = 21 B\u03bc\u03bd dy \u03bc \u2227 dy \u03bd where B\u03bc\u03bd is a constant symplectic matrix of\nrank 2n. Now consider a flow \u03c6t : U \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2192 M generated by the vector field Xt .\nUnder the action of \u03c6\u01eb with an infinitesimal \u01eb, we find that a point p \u2208 U whose\ncoordinate is y \u03bc is mapped to \u03c6\u01eb (y) \u2261 x\u03bc (y) = y \u03bc + \u01ebX \u03bc (y).

Equation (23) can be rewritten as \u03c6\u2217\u01eb (B + \u01ebF ) = B, which is\nexactly the result obtained from (22) by taking \u03c6\u2217\u01eb = (1 + \u01ebLX ).\nSo far, F = dA = \u2212LX B \u2208 \u0393(\u22272 T \u2217 M ) in Eq.(22) is an arbitrary closed 2-form\ndeforming the original symplectic structure B. Now we make an important identification that the one-form A \u2208 \u0393(T \u2217 M ) is a connection of U (1) bundle supported\non a symplectic manifold (M, B) and F = dA as its curvature.13 To phrase in\nphysics, we are considering electromagnetic fields F = dA defined on a symplectic\nmanifold (M, B). This identification is consistent with the Bianchi identity dF = 0\nin electromagnetism. Furthermore, the identification (21) is defined up to symplectomorphisms, i.e., X \u223c X + X\u03c6 \u21d4 A \u223c A + d\u03c6 where \u03b9X\u03c6 B + d\u03c6 = 0 and so\nLX\u03c6 B = 0, because it does not affect the symplectic structure \u03c91 or the curvature\n2-form F = dA. From the gauge theory point of view, the symplectomorphisms can\nbe identified with U (1) gauge transformations.14,15,16 In other words, the gauge\nsymmetry acting on U (1) gauge fields as A \u2192 A + d\u03c6 is generated by a Hamiltonian\nvector field X\u03c6 , i.e., satisfying \u03b9X\u03c6 B + d\u03c6 = 0.\nSo we arrive at an overwhelming evidence for the novel duality between Riemannian geometry (M, g) and symplectic geometry (M, \u03c9).2,3 The first important\npoint is that the U (1) gauge symmetry is a diffeomorphism symmetry generated by\na vector field X\u03c6 satisfying LX\u03c6 B = 0 which is known as the symplectomorphism\nin symplectic geometry. Therefore, the U (1) gauge symmetry on a symplectic manifold (M, B) should be regarded as a spacetime symmetry rather than an internal\nsymmetry. This result implies that U (1) gauge fields on a symplectic spacetime can\nbe realized as a spacetime geometry like as gravity in general relativity.2,3 In gen-\n\n\fAugust 17, 2018 11:43 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n8\n\nreview-mpla\n\nHyun Seok Yang\n\neral relativity, the equivalence principle beautifully explains why the gravitational\nforce has to manifest itself as a spacetime geometry. If the gauge/gravity duality\nis realized in noncommutative spacetime, it is necessary to realize a corresponding\nequivalence principle for the geometrization of the electromagnetic force.\nNote that we have already realized such a noble form of the equivalence principle\nin Eq.(23) as follows.2 The presence of dynamical gauge fields on a symplectic\nmanifold (M, B) appears only as a deformation of the symplectic manifold (M, B)\nsuch that the resulting symplectic structure is given by \u03c91 = B + F where F = dA.\nBut the result (22) immediately implies that the electromagnetic force F = dA can\nalways be eliminated by a local coordinate transformation generated by a vector\nfield X satisfying (21), as was explicitly shown in (23). Remarkably, the Poisson\nstructure (11) of spacetime admits the novel equivalence principle even for the\nelectromagnetic force which turns out to be the crux of the gauge/gravity duality.2,3\nThis geometrization of the electromagnetism is inherent as an intrinsic property in\nsymplectic geometry known as the Darboux theorem or the Moser lemma.1 As a\nconsequence, the electromagnetism on a symplectic spacetime can be realized as a\ngeometrical property of spacetime like gravity.d\nOne overarching lesson we have learned so far is that the Darboux theorem in\nsymplectic geometry manifests itself as a novel form of the equivalence principle such\nthat the electromagnetism on symplectic spacetime can be regarded as a theory of\ngravity. Hence, the final touch for the gauge/gravity duality is to find an explicit\nmap between electromagnetism and gravity.14,15,16 First, note that the U (1) gauge\nfield (21) deforming an underlying symplectic structure is completely encoded into\na local trivialization of the symplectic structure up to symplectomorphisms via the\nDarboux theorem or the Moser lemma.17,18 Let us denote the local coordinate\ntransformation \u03c6 : y \u03bc 7\u2192 x\u03bc (y) as\nb\u03bd (y) \u2208 C \u221e (M ),\nx\u03bc (y) \u2261 y \u03bc + \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd A\n\n(24)\n\n\u03bc\n\nwhere the local coordinates {y } will be assumed to be Darboux coordinates so\nthat the Poisson bracket {y \u03bc , y \u03bd }\u03b8 = \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd is a constant matrix of rank 2n. The\nargument (23) shows that such Darboux coordinates always exist. It is well-known1\nthat, for a given Poisson algebra (C \u221e (M ), {\u2212, \u2212}\u03b8 ), there exists a natural map\nC \u221e (M ) \u2192 T M : f 7\u2192 Xf between smooth functions in C \u221e (M ) and vector fields\nin T M such that\n\u0010\n\u2202f (y) \u2202 \u0011\ng(y)\n(25)\nXf (g)(y) \u2261 {g, f }\u03b8 (y) = \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd\n\u2202y \u03bd \u2202y \u03bc\nfor any g \u2208 C \u221e (M ). That is, we can obtain a vector field Xf = Xf\u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u2208 \u0393(T My )\n(y)\nfrom a smooth function f \u2208 C \u221e (M ) defined at y \u2208 M where Xf\u03bc (y) = \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd \u2202f\n\u2202y \u03bd .\nd It\n\nshould be emphasized that there is no need to introduce any Riemannian structure to realize\nthe equivalence principle for the electromagnetic force. It can be derived only in the context of\nsymplectic or Poisson geometry using the Poincar\u00e9 lemma and the bundle isomorphism B : T M \u2192\nT \u2217 M together with the Cartan's magic formula LX = d\u03b9X + \u03b9X d.\n\n\fAugust 17, 2018 11:43 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\nreview-mpla\n\nEmergent Geometry and Quantum Gravity\n\n9\n\nAs long as \u03b8 \u2208 \u0393(\u22272 T M ) in (25) is a Poisson structure of M , the assignment (25)\nbetween a Hamiltonian function f and the corresponding Hamiltonian vector field\nXf is the Lie algebra homomorphism in the sense\nX{f,g}\u03b8 = \u2212[Xf , Xg ]\n\n(26)\n\nwhere the right-hand side represents the Lie bracket between the Hamiltonian vector\nfields.\nFrom the above arguments, we see that U (1) gauge fields on a symplectic manifold (M, B = \u03b8\u22121 ) have been transformed into a set of smooth functions\nb\u03bc (y), \u03bc, \u03bd = 1, * * * , 2n} (27)\n{D\u03bc (y) \u2208 C \u221e (M )|D\u03bc (y) \u2261 B\u03bc\u03bd x\u03bd (y) = B\u03bc\u03bd y \u03bd + A\n\nthrough the coordinate transformation (24). Thus, we can apply the map\n(25) to embody the Lie algebra homomorphism (26) from the Poisson algebra\n(C \u221e (M ), {\u2212, \u2212}\u03b8 ) for the set (27) to the Lie algebra (\u0393(T M ), [\u2212, \u2212]) of vector\nfields defined by\n{V\u03bc = V\u03bca \u2202a \u2208 \u0393(T M )|V\u03bc (f )(y) \u2261 {D\u03bc (y), f (y)}\u03b8 , a = 1, * * * , 2n}\n\n(28)\n\nfor any f \u2208 C \u221e (M ). The vector fields V\u03bc = V\u03bca (y) \u2202y\u2202 a \u2208 \u0393(T My ) in (28) take\nvalues in the Lie algebra of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms because \u2202a V\u03bca = 0 by\ndefinition. But it can be shown that the vector fields V\u03bc \u2208 \u0393(T M ) are related to the\northonormal frames (vielbeins) E\u03bc by V\u03bc = \u03bbE\u03bc where \u03bb2 = det V\u03bca . Therefore, we\nsee that the Darboux theorem in symplectic geometry implements a deep principle\nto realize a Riemannian manifold as an emergent geometry from symplectic gauge\nfields through the correspondence (25) whose metric is given by\nds2 = \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd E \u03bc \u2297 E \u03bd = \u03bb2 \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd Va\u03bc Vb\u03bd dy a \u2297 dy b\n\n(29)\n\nwhere E \u03bc = \u03bbV \u03bc \u2208 \u0393(T \u2217 M ) are dual one-forms.2,3\nNote that the emergent metric (29) is completely determined by the set (27) of\nU (1) gauge fields and it describes any Riemannian manifold with a fixed asymptotic\nbackground.

Quantization of Gravity\nLet us recapitulate how we could get the Riemannian metric (29). We have considered electromagnetism on a symplectic spacetime (M, B). The electromagnetic\nfields in this case manifest themselves only as a deformation of symplectic structure such that the resulting symplectic spacetime is described by (M, B + F ) where\nF = dA. Via the Darboux theorem together with the homomorphism (25), this\ndeformation of symplectic structure in terms of the electromagnetic force F = dA\ncan be translated into a deformation of frame bundle over spacetime manifold M ;\n\n\fAugust 17, 2018 11:43 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n10\n\nreview-mpla\n\nHyun Seok Yang\n\n\u2202\u03bc \u2192 E\u03bc = E\u03bca (y)\u2202a , or, in terms of dual frames, dy \u03bc \u2192 E \u03bc = Ea\u03bc (y)dy a . That is,\nthe deformations of symplectic spacetime (M, B) in terms of electromagnetic force\nF = dA are isomorphic to those of Riemannian manifold (M, g)\nds2 = \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd dy \u03bc \u2297 dy \u03bd \u2192 ds2 = \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd E \u03bc \u2297 E \u03bd .\n\n(30)\n\nThis isomorphism implies that a field theory equipped with the fields in (27) on a\nsymplectic or Poisson spacetime gives rise to Einstein gravity.2,3 Another crucial\npoint, as will be shown below, is that an underlying field theory action for emergent\ngravity will be represented only by the Poisson bracket {D\u03bc , D\u03bd }\u03b8 (y) between the\nfields in (27), and so the equations of motion will be defined only with the Poisson\nbracket (14). If this is the case, quantum gravity will be much more accessible since\nthere is a natural symplectic or Poisson structure (11) and so it is obvious how to\nquantize the underlying system, as was already done in (5).\nWe demonstrate the emergent gravity with the following action\nZ\n1\nd2n y{D\u03bc (y), D\u03bd (y)}\u03b8 {D\u03bc (y), D\u03bd (y)}\u03b8\n(31)\nSP = 2\n4gY M\nwhere gY M is a 2n-dimensional gauge coupling constant.

Therefore classical\ngravity is defined by the action (31) and the so-called emergent gravity suggests a\nnovel and authentic way for quantum gravity where the quantization of gravity is\nreduced to quantizing a dynamical system described by the action (31).3 With the\nPoisson structure (11), who is still in agony to find a quantum world ?\nA question is whether the canonical quantization (5) for the action (31) correctly\ndescribes quantum spacetime geometries and resolves some notorious problems in\nclassical gravity, e.g., the cosmological constant problem.21,22 We will not try to\nanswer to the question right now because it may be premature to disclose.
