The main part is devoted to the transversity distribution its possible measurement and its first experimental probe via spin asymmetry in semi-inclusive\nDIS. It is argued that the proton transversity distribution could be successfully measured\nin future DIS experiments with longitudinally polarized target.\n\n1\n\nParton characteristics of hadrons\n\nIt is well known that three most important (twist-2) parton distributions functions (PDF) in a nucleon are the non-polarized distribution function f1 (x), the\nlongitudinal spin distribution g1 (x) and the transverse spin distribution h1 (x) [1].\nThe first two have been more or less successfully measured experimentally in classical deep inelastic scattering (DIS) experiments but the measurement of the last\none is especially difficult since it belongs to the class of the so-called chiral-odd\nstructure functions and can not be seen there.\nThe non-polarized PDF's was measured for decades and are rather well known in\nwide range of x and Q2 . Its behavior in Q2 is well described by the QCD evolution\nequation (DGLAP) and serves as one of the main source of \u03b1s (Q2 ) determination.\nThe most recent parametrization of these functions can be found in [2].\nOne of the main problem here is the very small x behavior. Summing the leading\nlog x with the help of the BFKL equation predicts a rather quick rise of xf1 (x) \u221d\nx\u22120.55 which seems to find some experimental support. Recent calculations of NLL\ncorrections, however, cardinally change this situation [3]. Another problem is the\nflavor asymmetry of the sea quarks connected with the break down of the Gottfried\nsum rule [4].\nThe longitudinal spin PDF's draw common attention during last decade in connection with the famous \"Spin Crisis\", i.e. astonishingly small portion of the proton\nspin carried by quarks (see [5] and references therein). The most popular explanation of this phenomenon is large contribution of the gluon spin \u2206G(x). The direct\ncheck of this hypothesis is one of the main problem of future dedicated experiments like COMPASS at CERN. Even now, however, there are some indication to\nconsiderable value of \u2206G(x) coming from the Q2 evolution of the polarized PDF's\nR1\n[6] with the result 0 dx\u2206G(x) = 0.58 \u00b1 0.12 at Q2 = 1 GeV 2 and from the first\ndirect experimental probe of \u2206G(x) by HERMES collaboration [7] with the result\n\u2206G(x)/G(x) = 0.41 \u00b1 0.18 in the region 0.07 < x < 0.28 (see Fig. 1).

The curves present different fits of polarized DIS.\n\nAnother problem here is the sea quark spin asymmetry. It is usually assumed in\nfitting the experimental data that \u2206\u016b = \u2206d \u0304 = \u2206s\u0304. This ad hoc assumption however\ncontradicts with large Nc limit prediction \u2206\u016b \u2248 \u2212\u2206d \u0304 [8]. This was previously\ndiscovered for the instanton model [9] and supported by calculations in the chiral\nquark soliton model [10, 11]. Also this agrees with the phenomenological approach\nbased on \"Pauly blocking principle\" [12]. An indication to a nonzero value for\n\u2206\u016b \u2212 \u2206d \u0304 was also observed in [13].\nTurn now to DIS with transversely polarized target. A new result on the structure\nfunction g2 was recently reported by E155x collaboration [14]. its twist-2 part is\nwell defined by the structure function g1 via Wandzura-Wilczek relation [15]\ng2W W (x, Q2 )\n\n2\n\n= \u2212g1 (x, Q ) +\n\nZ\n\n1\n\nx\n\ndy\ng1 (y, Q2 )\ny\n\n(1)\n\nand the deflection off this is just pure dynamical twist-3 contribution.

The only information comes from the Soffer inequality [18]\n|h1 (x)| \u2264 12 [f1 (x) + g1 (x)] which follows from density matrix positivity. To access\nthese chiral-odd structure functions one needs either to scatter two polarized protons and to measure the transversal spin correlation AN N in Drell-Yan process\n(what is the problem for future RHIC) or to know the transverse polarization of\nthe quark scattered from transversely polarized target. There are several ways to\ndo this:\n1. To measure a polarization of a self-analyzing hadron to which the quark\nfragments in a semi inclusive DIS (SIDIS), e.g. \u039b-hyperon [19]. The drawback of this method however is a rather low rate of quark fragmentation\ninto \u039b-particle (\u2248 2%) and especially that it is mostly sensitive to s-quark\npolarization.\n2. To measure a transverse handedness in multi-particle parton fragmentation\n[20], i.e. the correlation of the quark spin 4-vector s\u03bc and particle momenta\nki\u03bd , \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c3\u03c1 s\u03bc k1\u03bd k2\u03c3 k \u03c1 (k = k1 + k2 + k3 + * * * is a jet 4-momentum).\n3. To use a new spin dependent T-odd parton fragmentation function (PFF) [21,\n22, 23] responsible for the left-right asymmetry in one particle fragmentation\nof transversely polarized quark with respect to quark momentum\u2013spin plane.\n(The so-called \"Collins asymmetry\" [24].)\nThe last two methods are comparatively new and only in the last years some\nexperimental indications to the transversal handedness and to the T-odd PFF have\nappeared [25, 26]. The latter result was used [27] to extract the information on the\nproton transversity distribution 1) from recently observed azimuthal asymmetry in\nSIDIS by HERMES [29] collaboration and by SMC [30]. This will be the subject\nof the rest of my talk.\n2\n\nT-odd PFF's\n\nAnalogous of PDF's f1 , g1 and h1 are the PFF's D1 , G1 and H1 , which describe\nthe fragmentation of a non-polarized quark into a non-polarized hadron and a\nlongitudinally or transversely polarized quark into a longitudinally or transversely\npolarized hadron, respectively.\nThese PFF's are integrated over the transverse momentum P h\u22a5 of a hadron\nwith respect to a quark. With P h\u22a5 taken into account, new PFF's arise. Using\n1 ) A similar work was done also in the paper [28] where some adjustable parametrization for\nthe T-odd PFF and some estimations for h1 (x) were used. Our approach is free of any adjustable\nparameters.\n\nCzech. J. Phys. 51 (2001)\n\nA\n\n3\n\n\fA.V. Efremov\n\nthe Lorentz- and P-invariance one can write in the leading twist approximation 8\nindependent spin structures [21, 22]. Most spectacularly it is seen in the helicity\nbasis where one can build 8 twist-2 combinations, linear in spin matrices of the\nquark and hadron \u03c3, S with momenta k, P h .\nEspecially interesting is a new chiral-odd structure that describes a left\u2013right\nasymmetry in the fragmentation of a transversely polarized quark:\nH1\u22a5 \u03c3(k \u00d7 P h\u22a5 )/khPh\u22a5 i,\nwhere H1\u22a5 is a function of the longitudinal momentum fraction z and quark transverse momentum kT2 . The hPh\u22a5 i is the averaged transverse momentum of the final\nhadron 2). Since the H1\u22a5 term is chiral-odd, it makes possible to measure the proton\ntransversity distribution h1 in semi-inclusive DIS from a transversely polarized target by measuring the left-right asymmetry of forward produced pions (see [23, 31]\nand references therein). It serves as analyzing power of the Collins effect.\nThe problem is that, first, this function was completely unknown till recent\ntime both theoretically and experimentally. Second, the function H1\u22a5 is the socalled T-odd fragmentation function: under the naive time reversal P , k, S and \u03c3\nchange sign, which demands a purely imaginary (or zero) H1\u22a5 in the contradiction\nwith naive hermiticity. This, however, does not mean the break of T-invariance but\nrather the presence of an interference of different channels in forming the final state\nwith different phase shifts, like in the case of single spin asymmetry phenomena [32].\nA simple model for this function could be found in [24] 3). (In this aspect they are\nvery different with the T-odd PDF's which can not exist since they are purely real.\nInteraction among initial hadrons which could brings an imaginary part breaks the\nfactorization and the whole parton picture.) Thus, the situation here is far from\nbeing clear.\nMeanwhile, the data collected by DELPHI (and other LEP experiments) give a\npossibility to measure H1\u22a5 . The point is that despite the fact that the transverse\npolarization of quarks in Z0 decay is very small (O(mq /MZ )), there is a non-trivial\ncorrelation between transverse spins of a quark and an antiquark in the Standard Model: CTqq\u0304T = (vq2 \u2212 a2q )/(vq2 + a2q ), which are at Z 0 peak: CTu,c\nT \u2248 \u22120.74 and\nCTd,s,b\n\u2248\n\u22120.35.\nWith\nthe\nproduction\ncross\nsection\nratio\n\u03c3\n/\u03c3\n=\n0.78\nthis gives for\nu\nd\nT\nthe average over flavors value hCT T i \u2248 \u22120.5.\nThe transverse spin correlation results in a peculiar azimuthal angle dependence\nof produced hadrons, if the T-odd fragmentation function H1\u22a5 does exist [24, 34].\nA simpler method has been proposed by an Amsterdam group [22]. They predict\na specific azimuthal asymmetry of a hadron in a jet around the axis in direction of\na second hadron in the opposite jet 4)\n2 ) We use the notation of the work [21, 22, 23].

That is why this asymmetry prevails for the HERMES data where\nhQ2 i \u2248 2.5 GeV 2 . One can thus state that the effective chiral quark soliton model\n[38] gives a rather realistic picture of the proton transversity ha1 (x).\nThe interesting observable related to h1 (x) is \u0010the proton tensor\ncharge. The\n\u0011\nP R1\na\n\u0101\ncalculation in this model yields [40] h1 \u2261 a 0 dx h1 (x)\u2212h1 (x) = 0.6. Compare\n\nthis with most recent experimental value of the proton axial charge [6] a0 = 0.28 \u00b1\n0.05 and the value obtained in the same model a0 = 0.35 [41]. These very different\nvalues for the axial and tensor charges of the nucleon are in contradiction with the\nnonrelativistic quark model prediction.\nConcerning the asymmetry observed by SMC [30] on transversely polarized target one can state that it agrees with result of HERMES (see [27] for more details).\n\nIn conclusion, using the preliminary estimation for Collins effect analyzing power\nfrom DELPHI data and the effective chiral quark soliton model for the proton\ntransversity distribution we obtain a rather good description of the azimuthal\nasymmetries in semi-inclusive hadron production measured by HERMES and SMC,\nthough the experimental errors are yet large. This, however, is only the first experiments! We would like to stress that our description has no free adjustable\nparameters. Probably the most useful lesson we have learned is that to measure\ntransversity in SIDIS in the region of moderate Q2 it is not necessary to use a transversely polarized target. Due to approximate Wandzura-Wilczek type relations (9)\none can explore the longitudinally polarized target also. This is very important for\nfuture experiments, like COMPASS at CERN since the proton transversity could\nbe measured simultaneously with the spin gluon distribution \u2206G(x).\nReferences\n[1] J.Ralston and D.E.Soper: Nucl.Phys B152 (1979) 109.\nJ.L.Cortes, B.Pire, and J.P.Ralston: Z.
