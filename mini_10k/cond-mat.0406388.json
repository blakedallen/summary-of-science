These networks are made by nodes connected to each other via\nlinks, which may be directed or undirected (in the present\nwork we only deal with undirected links). Studies of their\nstructure show that most of them possess the small-world\nproperty, i.e. the mean path length is extremely small\nand every node can be reached by following a path consisting from a very small number of nodes, as compared\nto the case of lattice systems. A special feature, though,\nthat distinguishes this class of networks is the fact that\nthe probability distribution for a node to have k links to\nother nodes obeys a power law:\nP (k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b3 ,\n\non scale-free networks. In this work, we study a number of random walk properties, including mean-squared\ndisplacement, network coverage, and trapping processes\non scale-free networks of varying connectivities. Trapping has been considered in the past as a model for energy transfer, but also in a more general frame in the\ncontext of networks, as a model for the probability of\nreaching targets located on the network in a given concentration via random moves [5]. It is of interest, thus,\nto study the mechanism, the effects of connectivity, concentration, size, etc on such structures that exhibit these\nunique properties. Our results refer to small to moderate\ntime regimes, where we are still far from the asymptotic\nlimit. This limit has been known to be very hard to reach\nin regular lattices, too, and cannot be predicted by direct\nsimulation techniques.\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is a parameter that measures how densely connected a network can be. There is a wide range of reallife networks [1, 2] that have been shown to follow this\npower-law form in their connectivity, including networks\nin nature, such as the cell, metabolic networks and the\nfood web, artificial networks such as the Internet, the\nWWW and power grids, or even social networks, such as\nsexual partnership networks.\nThe scale-free networks, termed after the absence of\na characteristic typical node connectivity, exhibit many\nunusual properties as compared to simple lattice models,\nrandom graphs, or even small-world (Watts-Strogatz [3])\nnetworks. This scale-free character results in the existence of a small number of nodes which are connected to\na large number of other nodes. These super-connected\nnodes (termed 'hubs') have been shown to have a central\nplace in the interpretation of many of the network properties. A lot of work has been devoted in the literature to\nthe study of static properties of the networks, while interest is growing for dynamical properties on these networks.\nRecently [4], we presented results for the absence of kinetic effects in reaction-diffusion processes taking place\n\nII.\n\nRANDOM WALKS AND THE TRAPPING\nPROBLEM\n\nOne of the most basic quantities in the random walk\ntheory is the mean-squared displacement hR2 (n)i of a\nparticle diffusing in a given space, which is a measure\nof the distance R covered by a typical random walker\nafter performing n steps. In most cases, this quantity is\ndescribed by an expression of the form:\nhR2 (n)i \u223c na .\n\n(2)\n\nThe value of the parameter a classifies the type of diffusion into normal linear diffusion (a = 1), sub-diffusion\n(a < 1), or super-linear diffusion (a > 1). Of course,\nwhen we consider distinct time steps and nearest neighbor lattice hops the maximum value of a can be 2, i.e.\na completely biased walk where the random walker continuously moves away from the origin. Recently [6], the\nmean squared displacement was studied in small world\nnetworks, where it was shown that diffusion is linear and\nresults were found to collapse under a proposed scaling.\n\n\f2\nThe behavior of a random walk is also characterized\nby the coverage of the space, as expressed by the average\nnumber of distinct sites visited hSn i after n steps. In\nregular Euclidean lattices this quantity follows a power\nlaw with the number of steps, except in the case of two\ndimensions, where logarithmic corrections appear in the\ndenominator\n(hSn i \u223c n/ ln n). In one dimension hSn i \u223c\n\u221a\nn, and in dimensions higher than two hSn i \u223c n, and the\nnumber of sites visited grows linearly with the number\nof steps n, since the random walker practically visits at\neach step a new site. In infinite dimensions, of course,\nthe number hSn i of visited sites is equal to n, since there\nis no revisitation of sites during the walk, and the walker\ncovers the largest possible area. In small-world networks\na scaling ansatz was proposed [6], which was verified by\nsimulations, and hSn i shows a transition from a slope 0.5\n(one-dimensional behavior) to a slope 1 (d > 2 behavior).\nAn important process related to random walk theory\nis trapping [7, 8]. Trapping reactions have been widely\nstudied in the frame of physical chemistry, as part of\nthe general reaction-diffusion scheme. The general idea\nincludes two different species A and B, which diffuse\nfreely in a given space and upon proximity they react according to A+B\u2192B. Many different variations describe\na plethora of physical phenomena. In this paper we deal\nwith the special case of the trapping problem where B\nparticles are immobile. The simplest mean-field analytical treatment predicts a simple exponential decay in\nthe density of A's, while the earlier contributions to the\nsubject go back to Smoluchowski [9], who was the first\nto attempt to relate the macroscopic behavior with the\nmicroscopic picture by taking into account local density\nfluctuations. However, over the years a lot of work [7, 8]\nhas been devoted to the trapping problem which, even in\nits simplest form, was shown to yield a rich diversity of\nresults, with varying behavior over different geometries,\ndimensionalities and time regimes.\nThe main property monitored during such a process is\nthe survival probability \u03a6(n, c), which denotes the probability that a particle A survives after performing n steps\nin a space which includes traps B with a concentration\nc. It is well-known that \u03a6 behaves differently in different dimensions, as well as in different time-regimes.\nThe problem was studied in regular lattices and in fractal spaces[7, 8], and, recently, in small-world networks by\nBlumen and Jasch [10, 11, 12].\nThe simplest treatment of the trapping problem on\na lattice assumes that when a random walker has performed n steps and has visited Sn different lattice sites\nat least once, the probability that it has not yet been\ntrapped is equal to (1 \u2212 c)Sn , where c is the trap concentration. When this quantity is averaged over all different\npossible walks and trap configurations the resulting survival probability will be equal to\n\u03a6(n, c) = (1 \u2212 c)Sn = e\u2212\u03bbSn ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03bb = \u2212 ln(1 \u2212 c). A simplification of this equation\nwas first proposed by Rosenstock [13] and simply substi-\n\ntutes the above expression with the typical value of the\ndistribution, i.e.\n\u03a6(n, c) = e\u2212\u03bbhSn i .\n\n(4)\n\nThis approximation has the advantage that the mean\nvalue of the number of sites visited hSn i is well known [14]\nfor practically all dimensionalities (including e.g. fractal\nones). Notice that the Rosenstock approximation does\nnot necessarily imply a simple exponential decay, except\nin the case where hSn i \u223c n. The formula predicts simple exponential decay of the survival probability with the\nnumber of steps\n\u221a n only for d \u2265 3, and exponential dependence on n in d = 1. In 2 dimensions the predicted\nbehavior is rather complex, with logarithmic corrections\nin the exponent. The applicability of Eq. (4) is limited\nto short-times and/or not too large trap concentrations.\nWhen the survival probability becomes low enough, this\nexpression deviates significantly from the correct behavior.\nA significant improvement was possible by the use of\naveraged quantities, known as cumulants, where the averaged quantity of Eq. (3) can be written as a function\nof the cumulant generating function [15]:\nKJ (\u03bb, n) =\n\nJ\nX\nj=1\n\n(\u22121)j\n\n\u03bbj\nkj (n) ,\nj!\n\n(5)\n\nwhere kj (n) are the cumulants, which are associated to\nthe moments of Sn , e.g. k1 (n) = hSn i, k2 (n) = hSn2 i \u2212\nhSn i2 , etc. The expression (3) for the survival probability\nthen simply becomes\n\u03a6J (n, c) = exp(KJ (\u03bb, n)) .\n\n(6)\n\nImproved accuracy can be obtained upon increasing the\ntruncation order J. In theory, the knowledge of all the\nmoments (J \u2192 \u221e) for the Sn distribution is required for\nthe use of (5). These moments are known analytically\nonly in one-dimensional lattices, while for d > 1 usually\nthe first 2-4 moments are used.\nA detailed analytical treatment of the problem was\nperformed by Donsker and Varadhan [16], who were able\nto predict the asymptotic behavior of the survival probability as\n2\n\nd\n\nlim \u03a6(n, c) = exp(\u2212Kd \u03bb 2+d n d+2 ) .\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n(7)\n\nThe positive constant Kd depends only on the dimensionality and the structure of the lattice. This asymptotic expression does not provide any information on when the\nasymptotic limit is reached. Since it has been observed\nthat the Rosenstock approximation describes quite well\nthe high-\u03a6 regime, it is obvious that a crossover to the\nDonsker-Varadhan behavior will take place. The location\nof this crossover has been studied in detail [17, 18, 19],\nand it was shown that only with indirect methods it is\npossible to reach the asymptotic limit.\n\n\f3\nThis asymptotic behavior has also been explained via\nheuristic arguments. The slow relaxation of \u03a6 at long\ntimes is due to an interplay of two different factors. First,\nmean-field treatments assume a uniform trap distribution\nover the entire space. This is not strictly true, though,\nand for large enough sizes it is possible to find very extended trap-free regions. A random walker in such a\nregion will survive for extremely long times compared to\nwalkers in normal regions and will thus determine the\nasymptotic behavior. The second factor is due to unusually 'compact' random walks, which revisit many times\nthe same sites, and thus result to a very small value of\nSn , even at longer times.\nRecently, a number of papers were published concerning trapping on a version of the small-world networks\n[10, 11, 12]. These networks, first proposed as a model by\nWatts and Strogatz [3], are one-dimensional rings where\nadditional links are inserted between two random sites\nwith a given probability. It was shown that the results\nrepresent a fine interplay between pure order and pure\ndisorder statistics. Initially, the walkers feel only the\npresence of the one-dimensional lattice, but at longer\ntimes the behavior of the survival probability follows that\nof an open tree structure. The decays of the survival\nprobability were clearly not exponential, and the cumulants description did not yield accurate coincidence with\nthe numerical results in all of the studied cases.\nIn this work, we extend the above mentioned random\nwalk problems (mean-squared displacement, coverage,\nand trapping) in the case where the underlying structure is a scale-free network, obeying a power-law in the\nnodes connectivity distribution. The random walkers are\nlocated on the nodes and can only move along the links of\nthis network. In the case of the trapping model certain\nnodes are designated as traps, having a concentration\nc. We present computer simulations results for different\nnetwork connectivities and compare them to the known\nlattice behavior.\n\nIII.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nThe construction of a scale-free network follows the\nMolloy-Reed scheme [20]: First, we fix the number of\nnodes N in the system and the \u03b3 parameter, characteristic of the particular network. By using the transformation method we select N random numbers from the k \u2212\u03b3\ndistribution, so that each node i is assigned a number of\nlinks ki from the above distribution. The value of k lies\nin the range from kmin = 1 (lower cutoff) to kmax = N \u22121\n(no upper cutoff value is used for k).\nInitially, no links are established in the system. Each\nnode i extends ki 'hands' towards all other nodes. We\nrandomly select two such 'hands' (that do not belong in\nthe same node) and connect them creating thus a link.\nNo double links are allowed, so that if two nodes are already connected this link is rejected. We continue this\nprocess until all nodes have reached their pre-assigned\n\nconnectivity. However, it is possible that at the last\nstages of the construction we will reach a dead-end where\nno further links may be established according to the\nabove rules. In this case we simply ignore the 'hands'\nthat cannot be connected, since their number is always\nvery small and the structure of the network is not influenced at all.\nThe largest cluster in the network is identified via the\nuse of a spreading algorithm. We start with a random\nnode and mark it with a label, say X. We then mark all\nthe nodes connected to this node by X, and proceed iteratively by labeling their neighbors, etc, until the whole\ncluster has been labeled. We then choose another random node that has not been labeled by X, which means\nthat it belongs to a different cluster. We mark it by Y\nand again spread this labeling throughout this cluster.\nWhen the entire network has been labeled we can easily\nidentify the largest cluster from its size.\nAll random walks in this paper take place on the largest\ncluster of the network via the following algorithm. We\nplace a random walker on a randomly chosen site i of\nthe largest cluster. This site has a connectivity ki . At\neach Monte-Carlo step the walker makes a jump towards\na node connected to i (i.e. nearest neighbor) with probability 1/ki . This process gives a Markovian walk, since\neach step is independent of all previous steps. Distances\non the network are measured according to the shortestlength path between two nodes, and the displacement R\nof a walker is calculated relative to the initial point.\nFor the trapping problem, we randomly choose a percentage c of the network nodes and designate them as\ntraps. A random walker is placed on a random non-trap\nnode and performs the procedure described above until\nit meets a trap. In this case, it is annihilated and the\ntime n to trapping is recorded. We repeat the same process for many independent random walkers and different\nnetworks, and we construct a histogram H(n, c) of the\nnumber of walks that last exactly n steps. Then, the\nsurvival probability is simply given by\n\u03a6(n, c) = 1 \u2212\n\nn\n1 X\nH(m, c) ,\nM m=1\n\n(8)\n\nwhere M is the total number of independent random\nwalks sampled.\nTypically, 100 different networks with N = 106 nodes\nwere created, and 103 -104 different random origins were\nchosen on each network. Thus, results were averaged over\n105 -106 different realizations of the walk.\n\nIV.\nA.\n\nRESULTS\n\nMean squared displacement\n\nWe first study the mean squared displacement hR2 i\nof a random walker on a scale-free network.

The\nnetwork size in all cases is N = 106 nodes, and for \u03b3 = 3.0 we\nalso present results for networks of size N = 104 and N = 105\n(bottom to top). The dotted lines represent slopes of 1 and\n2. Inset: Normalized hR2 (n)i curves, so that asymptotically\nall curves converge to 1, for different \u03b3 values (shown on the\nplot). Dotted lines represent best-fit lines with slopes (left to\nright) 1.8, 1.5, 1.1, and 0.9.\n\nnetworks that we study are not embedded in a regular Euclidean space, this quantity does not measure how\nfar in Euclidean space the walker travels, but rather the\nminimum number of hops needed in order to return to\nits origin. The first important feature of Fig. 1, where\nwe present hR2 i as a function of time for networks of\nvarying connectivity distributions, is the fact that hR2 i\nequilibrates after a few steps to a constant displacement\nvalue. This is a simple manifestation of the very small\ndiameter of these networks, which has been shown to be\nof the order ln(ln N ) [21]. In practice, this means that\none node can be reached from all other nodes in the network within only a few steps and the maximum possible\ndistance in the network is very small compared to the\nnetwork size. Note also that the plateau value increases\nas we increase \u03b3, since a network which is less connected\nexhibits a larger diameter. The existence of the plateau\nis, of course, a finite-size effect. However, the size dependence is not strong, as can be seen in the figure, where\nwe present results for networks with \u03b3 = 3.0 and size\nN = 104 , 105 , and 106 . Although we increase the size\nof the networks by two orders of magnitude, the value\nof hR2 i increases from roughly 70 to 110, i.e. the distance R increases almost linearly from 8 to 10. This\nlogarithmic dependence shows that for all practical applications the plateau will be present. For example, it\nhas been observed [22] that the diameter of WWW (of\nsize N = 8\u00d7108 and \u03b3 = 2.45) is only 18, so that even on\nsuch large networks maximum distances remain small.\nIn the figure inset we have rescaled the hR2 (n)i data so\nthat all curves are normalized to an asymptotic value of 1.\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n10000\n\nTime (MC steps)\n\nTime (MC steps)\n\nFIG. 2: Number of distinct sites visited hSn i after n steps on\nscale-free networks with (solid lines, top to bottom) \u03b3=2.0,\n2.5, 3.0 and 3.5. The dashed line is the infinite-dimensional\ncase of hSn i = n + 1. The network size was N = 106 .\n\nIt is shown that upon varying the value of \u03b3, diffusion on\nscale-free networks may range from superlinear to sublinear diffusion. For networks of low \u03b3, diffusion is greatly\nenhanced. Thus, for \u03b3 = 2.0 the walkers move away from\nthe origin rapidly and the slope of hR2 i reaches a value\nof about 1.8. After only a few steps, though, the value of\nhR2 i saturates, due to the phenomenon described above.\nAs we increase the value of \u03b3 the slope of the curves\ndecreases. Diffusion at early steps remains super-linear,\nuntil we reach a value of \u03b3 around 3.0 where the slope\nbecomes roughly equal to 1. This linear diffusion turns\nslowly into sub-linear as we further increase \u03b3 and for\n\u03b3 = 3.5 the slope is equal to 0.9.\n\nB.\n\nNetwork coverage\n\nThe coverage of the network by random walks is found\nto be a very efficient process. Numerical results of hSn i\non scale-free networks are presented in Fig. 2. The number of sites visited increases initially with a slow rate, but\nafter a crossover value the increase is almost linear. This\nasymptotic linearity is observed in all \u03b3 values, while the\ncrossover point shifts towards longer times with increasing \u03b3. The early time slope means that the walkers initially spend some time exploring the neighborhood they\nwere created in and visit the same sites. After the first\nfew steps (the exact number depends on the connectivity of the network) they escape their initial territory and\ndiffuse around the entire network. Thus, it is possible to\ncontinuously visit new sites, which results in the linear\nincrease of hSn i. In reference [6], hSn i on small\n\u221a world\nnetworks was found to scale at early times with n and\nasymptotically with n. In the case of scale-free networks,\n\u221a\nthe early-time behavior is not consistent with a n law,\nwhich would be an indication of one-dimensional behav-\n\n\f5\nior. For each \u03b3 value the local environment is different,\nand this is exhibited in the different evolution of hSn i\nfor low n values. The crossover, also, is located at much\nearlier times (of the order of tens of steps) as compared\nto thousands of steps which is the case reported in [6] for\nsmall world networks.\nThe size of the network used (N = 106 ) was two orders\nof magnitude larger than the number of steps performed,\nin order to avoid finite size effects. Despite of this precaution, the curve of \u03b3 = 2 seems to deviate from linearity at\nlonger times. This phenomenon means that revisitation\nalready starts to exhibit itself for the finite network we\nstudy.\nThe linear growth of hSn i is similar to the behavior\nexhibited in dendrimer structures, modeled by Cayley\ntrees. These are open structures, with every node having\na fixed number k of connected nodes which are always\ndirected away from the central core. It was also shown in\nthat case [23] that hSn i had a linear increase after a short\nearly-time sublinear regime, due to the same reasons as\nhere.\nConsider, now, a regular lattice that can be embedded\nin a finite d-dimensional space. In this case, it is wellknown that unconstrained diffusion causes the random\nwalker to spread in the available space, increasing both\nhR2 i and hSn i with time. Thus, the walkers tend to increase their distance from the origin and cover new territory. If for some reason we restrict diffusion of the walkers\nwithin a finite distance Rc from the origin, so that hR2 i\nsaturates, then the area covered will soon saturate, too,\nto a value of order Rcd . Diffusion on scale-free networks,\nthough, is different. Although the walker is always close\nto the origin and restricted within a distance equal to the\nnetwork diameter, new territory is continuously sampled.\nThis peculiar behavior can be attributed to the existence\nof the hubs. If we consider an extreme case of a hub,\nthat of a star node where all the nodes are connected\nonly to the hub, then the displacement will be at most\n2 steps away, but due to the large number of nodes in\nthe system the walker will be redirected to a non-visited\nsite with a revisitation probability n/N , which for large\nenough systems and early to moderate times is close to\n0. The particular case of L\u00e9vy flights [24] (which usually results in enhanced diffusion with a > 1 in Eq. 2)\ncan be considered similar to the process we study in this\npaper. In a L\u00e9vy flight the length of a jump follows a\npower law dependence. In practice, a walker samples an\narea for a certain amount of time before performing a\nlong-range jump. This jump allows then the walker to\nsample a new space. Although the areas of space visited\ncan be regarded as the hubs of the present problem, the\nmain difference is the displacement of the walk. In the\ncase of L\u00e9vy flights the 'hubs' of the system are distant\nin space among each other, while in our case the hubs are\nvery close to each other, and can even be directly connected. As we have already seen, thus, the mean squared\ndisplacement on scale-free networks (even of large size)\nis restricted to small distances, whereas hR2 i increases\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n\u03a6(n,c)\n10\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n-5\n\n10 0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n\nTime (MC steps)\n\nFIG. 3: Survival probability as a function of time, for a\nnetwork of \u03b3 = 2.5 and trap concentration c = 0.01. From\nright to left, the number of nodes in the network is N = 103 ,\n104 , 105 , and 106 .\n\nmonotonically in the case of L\u00e9vy flights.\n\nC.\n\nTrapping\n\nFor the trapping problem, we first examine the dependence of the survival probability \u03a6 on the system size N .\nAs it can be seen in Fig. 3 for \u03b3 = 2.5, larger networks\nyield a significantly lower survival probability. This is\ndue to the higher probability of finding a node with very\nhigh connectivity, which is linked directly with the largest\npart of the network. Due to the power-law dependence\nthe appearance of these nodes increases as we increase\nthe network size. However, we can see that the \u03a6-curves\nfor the larger networks (N \u2265 105 ) practically coincide.\nMoreover, this N -dependence is much weaker for networks with higher \u03b3 values. As we can see in the plot,\nthe large-size network behavior in this case is very close\nto a simple exponential decay, while smaller networks deviate from this behavior.\nIn Fig. 4(a) we present the survival probability on the\nlargest cluster for different trap concentrations as a function of time, for networks with \u03b3 = 2.5. For a relatively\nhigh trap concentration, e.g. c = 0.05, we can see that\n\u03a6 falls very rapidly and during the first 100 steps only\na small percentage of the walkers has survived. The decay retains for the largest part an exponential character.\nIn order to test the validity of the Rosenstock approximation for scale-free networks, we used the numerical\ndata for hSn i presented in Fig. 2 and computed the survival probability \u03a6 using Eq. (4). The results in Fig. 4\nshow that there is almost complete coincidence between\nthis approximation and the simulation data. As we have\nmentioned above, the Rosenstock approximation is valid\nwhen mean-field features are present, and fluctuations in\nthe area covered are not important.

From left to right, the trap concentrations\nare c = 0.05, 0.01, 0.005, and 0.001.\n\nconcentration implies that there will be no large trapfree regions, since a walker can easily escape any part of\nthe system. However, in the case of \u03b3 = 2.5 the same\nargument is true as we gradually move towards lower\nconcentrations. The survival probability retains the simple exponential character as we decrease c, even for the\nlowest trap concentrations used. The Rosenstock approximation, Eq. (4), predicts this simple exponential decay\nonly in the time range where hSn i \u223c n. As we have seen,\nthough, in Fig. 2 there is a crossover in the behavior of\nhSn i with time, which should modify this behavior. However, this crossover takes place at early times and is not\napparent in the linear time scale used for the survival\nprobability. The Rosenstock approximation, thus, based\non the results of Fig. 2, predicts a simple exponential\ndecay for \u03a6 on scale-free networks.\nFig. 4(a) validates, thus, the assumption that the\nRosenstock approximation is true in the case of scale-free\nnetworks with \u03b3 = 2.5. The decay of the survival probability, though, is greatly influenced by \u03b3. In Fig. 4(b), the\nresults for \u03b3 = 3.5 and large trap concentrations c clearly\n\ndemonstrate a deviation from a simple exponential behavior and the failure of the Rosenstock approximation.\nOnly in the case of low c, such as c = 10\u22123 , this approximation is satisfactory and describes reasonably well\nthe exponential decay of the simulation data. Thus, for\n\u03b3 = 3.5 we also employed the cumulant approximation\nof Eq. (6). The higher-order moments of the Sn distribution were calculated numerically, via the same simulations that yielded the first moment hSn i of Fig. 2. It is\nevident that the description of the data improves significantly. The second-order truncation (i.e. including the\nstandard deviation of the Sn distribution) follows quite\nclosely the simulation data for c = 0.05 and c = 0.005\nover more than three decades on the vertical axis. In the\ncase of c = 0.01 we need to include higher moments in\norder to achieve the same level of accuracy, since \u03a62 captures only part of the behavior. The fourth-order truncation \u03a64 seems to be quite succesful over almost four\ndecades, and describes a significant non-exponential part\nof the curve quite well.\nIn Fig. 5 we present the survival probability (c = 0.01)\nin different scale-free networks and in regular lattices. We\ncan see that as \u03b3 increases the survival probability becomes higher. Since the number of connections between\nthe nodes decreases with \u03b3 and we have seen that the average value of the number of sites visited also decreases,\nthe walkers will spend more time in smaller network regions. This has a dramatic influence on \u03a6 and as we can\nsee in the figure the difference in the survival probability\nbetween networks of \u03b3 = 2 and \u03b3 = 3.5 can be two orders\nof magnitude, even only after a few hundred steps. The\nshape of the curves is also different, since the exponential\ncharacter of the lowest \u03b3 values is no longer retained for\n\n\f7\n\u03b3 > 3. This change in the decay, along with the much\nslower relaxation is a manifestation of the network structure, which for \u03b3 > 3 corresponds to a loosely connected\nnetwork where the number of nodes with extremely high\nconnectivity has diminished.\nInspection of Fig. 5 and similar simulations for different concentrations on networks with \u03b3 = 3 suggest that\nin the range 2 < \u03b3 < 3 the Rosenstock approximation\nprovides a reliable description in the time regime studied\nin this work. On the contrary, when \u03b3 > 3 this approximation is not valid and one needs to resort to the use of\nhigher moments in the cumulant expression.\nConcerning the comparison with regular lattices, it is\nobvious that trapping in the most connected networks\n(\u03b3 =2-3) behaves in a similar manner as in 3-dimensional\nlattices (simple exponential decay), and for \u03b3 \u2264 2.5 decays in a similar rate, too. The case of a two-dimensional\nlattice represents the borderline dimension for recurrent\nrandom walks in lattices, and the relaxation of \u03a6 is not\nexponential, while for d = 1 the survival probability is\nconsiderably higher, since the walkers are confined between two trapping sites and perform a random walk in\nthis region. Similarly to the d \u2264 2 cases, the survival\nprobability relaxation in networks with \u03b3 > 3 is not exponential and, in general, cannot be described by the\nRosenstock approximation.\nScale-free networks have been considered heuristically\nto behave as infinite-dimensional lattices. This assumption (d \u2192 \u221e), however, implies that both the Rosenstock approximation (Eq. 4) and the Donsker-Varadhan\nresult (Eq. 7) would yield a single exponential decay\n\u03a6(n) \u223c exp(\u2212n) with the number of steps n. As we\nhave seen, though, this result can be verified in the presented time scale by the simulations for networks in the\nrange 2 < \u03b3 < 3, but not for \u03b3 > 3. The reason is that\nin d \u2192 \u221e the probability for a walker to revisit a site is\nvanishingly small, since at every step the walker has an\ninfinite number of possible sites to jump to. Thus, the\nrevisitation probability tends to zero and the number of\nsites visited is equal to the number of steps performed\n(hSn i \u223c n). Eq. (4) then predicts the same behavior as\n(7), i.e. \u03a6(n) \u223c exp(\u2212n). For scale-free networks the\nsituation is somewhat different, though. Although there\nare a few highly connected nodes in the system (hubs),\nfrom where a walker can be directed to previously unsampled areas of the network, the largest percentage of\nthe nodes has a very small number of links, e.g. k = 1\n\nor k = 2. A walker that reaches such a node will return\nat the next step to its former position. The character\nof a scale-free network as a substrate for random walks,\nthus, cannot be described as purely infinite-dimensional.\nThe dimensionality can be considered as a local property\nwhich is modified according to the area of the network\nwhere the walker lies in. Depending on the value of \u03b3,\nthe area sampled depends on how connected a system\ncan be and how easy it is for a random walker to visit\nnew nodes. For sparse networks, for example, the revisitation probability increases (together with the network\ndiameter) and leads to larger deviations of the above law.\n\n[1] R. Albert and A.-L.

The Rosenstock approximation is adequate for predicting the survival probability\nin the range 2 < \u03b3 < 3, but for higher \u03b3 it cannot account\nfor the non-exponential character of the survival probability decay with time. In this case, we found that the\ncumulant expansion can fit quite accurately the observed\nbehavior.\nThe mean-field character (exhibited by the validity of\nthe Rosenstock approximation) for \u03b3 < 3 can be also\nexpected in the case of these networks, since the heuristic\narguments supporting the Donsker-Varadhan expression\n(Eq. 7) do not apply here. Although a walk can still\nbe compact, large trap-free regions do not exist on such\na network. The main reason is the small average path\nlength between any two nodes of the structure. For any\ntrap distribution, there are not any network areas where\na walker can spend a lot of time without meeting a trap,\nsince the connectivity of the network allows it to easily\nescape to a different neighborhood, where traps may exist\nin a larger local concentration. When \u03b3 > 3, though, the\nimportance of the hubs in a network diminishes, and the\nbehavior resembles more that of regular low-dimension\nlattices, with prominent non-exponential decays even at\nearly times.\n\n\f8\n[9] M. v.
