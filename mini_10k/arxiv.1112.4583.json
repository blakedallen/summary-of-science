We performed photometric and polarimetric monitoring of this outburst in the optical\nand near-infrared bands with TRISPEC and HOWPol attached to the Kanata telescope. We also observed\nthis outburst in the infrared band with AKARI, and the radio band with the 32-m radio telescope of\nYamaguchi University. The object was in an active state from JD 2455055 to 2455159. It was 1.3 mag\nbrighter than its quiescent state before JD 2455055 in the optical band. After the end of the active state\nin JD 2455159, a prominent outburst was observed in all wavelengths. The outburst continued for two\nmonths. Our optical and near-infrared polarimetric observations revealed that the position angle of the\npolarization (PA) apparently rotated clockwise by 240 degrees within 11 d in the active state (JD 2455063-\n2455074), and after this rotation, PA remained almost constant during our monitoring. In the outburst\nstate, PA smoothly rotated counterclockwise by 350 degrees within 35 d (JD 2455157-2455192). Thus,\nwe detected two distinct rotation events of polarization vector in opposite directions. We discuss these two\nevents compared with the past rotation events observed in 2005, 2007 and 2008.\nKey words: BL Lacertae Objects: individual: 3C 454.3 - polarization - infrared: general\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nBlazar is a class of active galactic nuclei, whose relativistic jets are considered to be directed along the line of\nsight (e.g. Blandford et al. 1979). Radiation of blazars\nhas three main properties. First, the blazars emit electromagnetic radiation in a broad range from the radio to\ngamma-ray bands. Their emission consists of two major\ncomponents (e.g. Kubo et al. 1998). The low energy component is synchrotron radiation observed from the radio\nto the optical, sometimes extending to the X-ray bands.\nThe high energy component is inverse-Compton scattering from the X-ray to the gamma-ray bands. Second,\nblazars exhibit rapid and violent variability in all wavelength bands (Antonucci 1993). The variability has various timescales from less than a day (e.g. Aharonian\net al. 2007; Albert et al. 2007; Sasada et al. 2008; Raiteri\net al. 2008b) to longer than years (e.g. Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4 et al.\n1996). Third, blazars possess relativistic jets (e.g. Lister\net al. 2009), which are responsible for high polarization\nobserved at optical/near-infrared (NIR), and radio wavelengths. Since the polarization can be a probe of the magnetic field in the jet, polarimetric observations are important to study the structure of the jet.\n\nThe temporal variation of the polarization vector is\ncomplex in general. Jones et al. (1985) reported that the\npolarization behavior was erratic in blazars. On the other\nhand, several papers reported that the polarization vector exhibited systematic variations, for example, positive\ncorrelations between the flux and the degree of polarization (PD) (e.g. Smith et al. 1986). Recently, Marscher\net al. (2008) have reported that the polarization vector\nin BL Lac smoothly rotated when the object was bright.\nFrom this result, they proposed that this rotation indicated an emission zone passing through a helical magnetic\nfield in the jet. Abdo et al. (2010a) reported a rotation\nof polarization in 3C 279, and proposed that the rotation\nevent is attributed to a bent jet. However, there are only\na few rotation events which have been reported to date.\n3C 454.3 is one of the most famous blazars. The object\nis classified as Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs),\nand its redshift is z = 0.859 (Jackson & Browne 1991).\nAlthough the object had been quiet in the optical band\nuntil 2001, the object has kept showing the active behavior since then (Villata et al. 2006). In 2005, the object\nshowed an exceptional outburst. In this outburst, the object brightened from the radio to the gamma-ray bands\n(Fuhrmann et al. 2006; Pian et al. 2006; Giommi et al.\n\n\f2\n\nM. Sasada et al.\n\n2006 ; Villata et al. 2007). After this outburst, similar\noutbursts were detected in 2007 and 2008. In 2005 and\n2007 outbursts, rotation events of the optical polarization vector were reported by Jorstad et al. (2010) and\nSasada et al. (2010). In Dec. 2009, a prominent outburst was reported for this object in the gamma-ray band\nby Fermi/LAT and AGILE (Striani et al. 2009a; Striani\net al. 2009b; Escande & Tanaka 2009; Striani et al. 2010;\nPacciani et al. 2010; Ackermann et al. 2010), in the Xray band by INTEGRAL/IBIS (Vercellone et al. 2009), by\nSwift/XRT (Sakamoto et al. 2009), by Swift/BAT (Krimm\net al. 2009), in the optical bands (Villata et al. 2009a;\nBonning et al. 2009; Sasada et al. 2009). The object\nwas the brightest source in the GeV-gamma-ray sky for\nover a week (Ackermann et al. 2010). The object showed\nflux variability over timescales less than three hours and\nvery mild spectral variability with an indication of gradual\nhardening preceding major flares. The minimum Doppler\nfactor was 13, estimated by using these results. Bonnoli\net al. (2011) also estimated the Doppler factors \u223c 25 during the outburst by constructing a multi-wavelength spectral model.\nWe performed monitor observations of 3C 454.3 from\nMay 2009 to February 2010 in a multi-color photometric\nand polarimetric mode using the Kanata telescope. We\nalso observed in the radio and infrared (IR) bands. In this\npaper, we report on the behavior of the 2009 outburst in\nthese bands, and the detections of two rotation events in\nthe polarization vector. Directions of these two rotations\nwere different, suggesting a complex magnetic field in the\njet. This paper is arranged as follows: In section 2, we\npresent the observation method and analysis in the radio,\ninfrared, optical and X-ray bands. In section 3, first we\nreport the light curves and the spectral indexes of the\nX-ray and optical bands. Then, we report the temporal\nbehavior of polarization in the optical and NIR bands.\nAfter that, we report the spectral energy distribution from\nthe radio to optical band. In section 4, we discuss two\nrotation events which we detected, by comparing them\nwith the past rotation events observed in 2005, 2007 and\n2008. The conclusion is drawn in section 5.\n2.\n2.1.\n\nObservation\nTRISPEC and HOWPol attached to the Kanata\ntelescope\n\nWe performed monitor observations of 3C 454.3\nusing TRISPEC attached to the Cassegrain focus\nof the Kanata 1.5-m telescope at Higashi-Hiroshima\nObservatory. TRISPEC can perform photometric and polarimetric observations in the optical and two NIR bands,\nsimultaneously (Watanabe et al. 2005). In the observation\nof 3C 454.3, unfortunately, one of the two NIR arrays was\nnot available due to a readout error. Therefore, we observed the object with the multi-color photometric and\npolarimetric monitoring in the V and J bands. A unit of\nthe observing sequence consisted of successive exposures\nat four position angles of a half-wave plate; 0\u25e6 , 45\u25e6 , 22.\u25e6 5,\n67.\u25e6 5. A set of polarization parameters was derived from\n\n[Vol. ,\n\neach set of the four exposures.\nWe also observed in the multi-color photometric mode\nin the RC and IC bands during the outburst of the\nobject using HOWPol (Hiroshima One-shot Wide-field\nPolarimeter; Kawabata et al. 2008) attached to a Nasmyth\nfocus of the Kanata telescope. In this paper, we use multiband photometric data obtained with HOWPol in \u00a7 3.3.\nThe integration time depended on the sky condition and\nthe brightness of 3C 454.3. Typical integration times were\n90 and 85 s in the V and J bands, respectively. All images were bias-subtracted and flat-fielded, before aperture\nphotometry. We performed differential photometry with\na comparison star taken in the same frame of 3C 454.3.\nIts position is R.A.=22h 53m 58.s 11, Dec.=+16\u25e6 09\u2032 07.\u2032\u2032 0\n(J2000.0) and its magnitude is V =13.587, RC =13.035,\nIC =12.545 and J=11.858 (Gonz\u00e1lez \u2212 P\u00e9rez et al. 2001;\nSkrutskie et al. 2006). After the differential photometry,\nwe calculated the flux, assuming that the 0 mag corresponds to the flux with 1.98, 1.42, 0.895 and 0.384\u00d710\u22125\nerg cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the V , RC , IC and J bands (Fukugita\nSimasaku & Ichikawa 1995; Bessell, Castelli & Plez 1998).\nWe confirmed that the instrumental polarization was\nsmaller than 0.1 % in the V and J bands using the observation of unpolarized standard stars. We, hence, applied no correction for it. The instrumental depolarization factors, \u03b1Vdep and \u03b1Jdep , was derived from the observation using Glan-Taylor prism, to be \u03b1Vdep =0.827 and\n\u03b1Jdep =0.928. The observation was corrected for it. The\nzero point of the position angle of polarization (PA) is\ndefined by the standard system (measured from north\nto east) by observing the polarized stars, HD 19820 and\nHD 25443 (Wolff, Nordsieck & Nook 1996).\n2.2.\n\nSwift/XRT\n\nWe utilized the archival data of Swift/XRT for deriving\nthe X-ray light curve. The XRT observations were carried\nout using the Photon Counting (PC) readout mode. The\nXRT data were reduced using FTOOLS in the HEAsoft\npackage (v6.6). We extracted the source event within a\nradius of 50\" and background event within radii of 80-\n100\" centered on the source. We used the XSPEC package (v11.3) to fit the data. We applied an absorbed powerlaw model with Galactic absorption fixed at a value of\nNH = 1.1 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 (wabs*powerlaw model in XSPEC)\n(Donnarumma et al. 2009).\n2.3.\n\nAKARI\n\nThe NIR spectroscopic observations of 3C 454.3 were\ncarried out at 14:42:27 on 12 Dec., 15:25:22 on 13 Dec. and\n01:18:31 on 14 Dec. in 2009(UT) with the AKARI satellite in the framework of the AKARI Open Time Observing\nprograms for the Phase 3-II \"Blazar Variability in nearInfrared, Optical and Gamma-ray regions (BVIOG)\" (PI:\nM. Sasada). All the observations were performed with\nthe spectroscopic mode (AOT IRCZ4; Onaka et al. 2010)\nin which the data were taken with the prism, NP (1.8\u2013\n5.5 \u03bcm; Ohyama et al. 2007), installed in the NIR channel of the Infrared Camera (IRC; Onaka et al. 2007) of\nthe AKARI satellite. Each of the data reduction proce-\n\n\f2.4.\n\nYamaguchi radio telescope\n\nThe radio observation was carried out with the\nYamaguchi 32-m radio telescope at the center frequency\nof 8.38 GHz and bandwidth of 400 MHz in the total power\nmode. The antenna temperatures were measured at the\nposition of 3C 454.3 and at four positions 2 arc-min (a\nhalf of FWHM) offset to positive and negative in both azimuth and the elevation directions from the target so as\nto obtain the true antenna temperature by correcting the\npointing error of the telescope. A flux calibrator 3C 48\nwas observed at the same elevation of 3C 454.3. The flux\ndensity of 3C 454.3 was determined from the ratio of the\nantenna temperatures of 3C 454.3 to 3C 48, and the flux\ndensity of 3C 48 (3.34 Jy, Ott et al. 1994).

The X-ray and optical light curves\nshow that the flux of 3C 454.3 was variable, and we define three states based on the light-curve structure. The\nfirst state is a quiescent state from the start date of our\nmonitoring to JD 2455055. The second state is an active\nstate from JD 2455055 to 2455159. And the third state is\nan outburst state after JD 2455159. The flux in the quiescent state was less variable and faint both in the X-ray\nand optical bands compared with the flux after the active\nstate. The active state was characterized by several short\nand small flares with duration of \u223c 10 d and amplitude\nof a factor <\n\u223c 3. On JD 2455159, the object had suddenly\nbecome bright both in the X-ray and optical band, simultaneously. In the decline phase of the outburst, we can\nestimate a decline rate, \u03c4 , assuming that the flux follows\nan exponential decay, that is, F (t) \u221d e\u2212t/\u03c4 (B\u00f6ttcher et al.\n2007). The decline rates were 14\u00b12 and 49\u00b13 d in the Xray and optical bands. Hence, the flux decline in the X-ray\nband was faster than that in the optical band.\nRadio observations at 8.38 GHz were also performed in\nJD 2455125, 2455127, 2455133 and 2455172 by Yamaguchi\n\n-2 -1\n\n3\n\n0.02\n\n0.01\n\n2.0\n\n\u0393\n\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n\n-2 -1\n\n\u03bdF\u03bdV (erg cm s )\n\ndure, including the subtraction of the detector dark current, correction for the high-energy ionizing particles effects, the shift and co-addition of the exposure frames,\nand the wavelength calibration for NP data, follows those\nin the IRC Spectroscopy toolkit for Phase 3 data Version\n20110114.

The radio flux\ndensity was constant at 8.1 Jy and no significant change\nwas observed during the active and outburst states. The\nlack of a tight correlation between the radio and optical fluxes was also reported in past studies of 3C 454.3\n(Villata et al. 2007).\nThe photon index in the X-ray band, \u0393 was almost constant during our monitoring period, except for a possible\nvariations at the onset of the active state; a temporary\nsoftening of spectra can be seen in \u223cJD 2455070, while\nits variation amplitude is small. Raiteri et al. (2011) also\nanalyzed the same XRT data, and reported that no real\nchanges in \u0393 could be detected from 2008 to 2010. It is\nalso noteworthy that no prominent change in \u0393 was associated with the outburst state.\nIn the quiescent state, V \u2212 J was about 1.6. The V \u2212 J\ncolor in the quiescent state was bluer than those in the\nactive and outburst states. This feature indicates a, socalled, redder-when-brighter trend. The same color behavior was reported in past observations of 3C 454.3 (e.g.\nRaiteri et al. 2008a; Sasada et al. 2010). It is widely\naccepted that this feature appears because an underlying thermal emission in the UV band, called as Big Blue\nBump; BBB, is bluer than the variable synchrotron emission (Raiteri et al. 2007).\n\n\f-2 -1\n\n-2 -1\n\na\n\n10\n\n2\n\n25\n\nb\nPDJ (%)\n\n15\n10\n\n2\n0\n25\n\n10\n\n0\n180\n\n0\n180\n\n150\n\n150\nPAJ (deg)\n\n5\n\n120\n90\n60\n\n200\n\nA\n\nB\n\n0\n-200\n-400\n\n120\n90\n60\n30\n\nc\n\n0\n\n4950 5000 5050 5100 5150 5200\nJD - 2450000\n\nA\n\n200\ncor.

The\npanel \"b\", \"c\", \"f\" and \"g\" show the temporal variation\nof the PD and PA in the V and J bands. The PD in the\nactive and outburst states exhibited large variations compared with the PD in the quiescent state. The averaged\nPDV were 4.5, 6.0 and 8.9 % and the averaged PDJ were\n7.3, 9.2 and 12.2 % in the quiescent, active and outburst\nstates, respectively. In the outburst state, the maxima\nof the PDV and PDJ were 22.0\u00b11.4 and 24.1\u00b10.4 % on\nJD 2455180. The averaged PDJ were higher than the averaged PDV in all states. The high PD in the J band is\npartly due to a low contribution of the unpolarized flux\nfrom the BBB component in the J band.\nWe corrected the PA assuming that the temporal variation in the PA is less than 90\u25e6 between neighbor two observations.\nq We defined the variation as \u2206 P An = P An+1 \u2212\n\n0.0\n\nU (x 10\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.4\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0.0\nQ (x 10\n\n-2 -1\n\nerg cm s )\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n-11\n\nerg cm s )\n\n-11\n\nerg cm s )\n\n0.4\n\n-2 -1\n\nB\n\n0.0\n\n-0.4\n\n-11\n\n2\n\nP An \u2212 \u03b4 P An+1 + \u03b4 P An , where P An+1 and P An\nwere the n+1- and n-th PA and \u03b4 P An+1 and \u03b4 P An were\nthe errors of n+1- and n-th PA. If \u2206 P An < \u221290\u25e6 (> +90\u25e6 ),\nwe add +180\u25e6 (\u2212180\u25e6 ) to P An+1 . If |\u2206 P An | < 90\u25e6 , we\nperformed no correction of P An+1 . The panel \"d\" and\n\"h\" show the corrected PA.\nIn the panel \"d\", two rotation events can be seen,\n\"A\" and \"B\". The rotation event \"A\" occurred from\nJD 2455063 to 2455074 when the object entered the active\nstate. The rotation event \"B\" occurred from JD 2455157\nto 2455192, during the outburst state. In the quiescent\nstate, there was no rotation event. Thus, we can consider\nthat these rotation events were associated with the activity of the object. After the rotation \"A\", the PA was\nconstant during the active state, at about 170\u25e6 \u00b130\u25e6 .\nThese rotations can be confirmed also in the J-band\nobservations, while the timings of the PA correction are\ndifferent in several points as shown in panel \"h\". This is\nmostly due to large errors of PA (\u03b4 P A) in the J-band observations. The PA correction mentioned above depends\non \u03b4 P A. In addition, the data number of the J-band\nobservation is smaller than that of the V -band one. This\nis partly due to mechanical errors of our NIR detector.\nThus, the PA correction for the V -band data is more reliable than that for the J-band one. For example, in panels\n\"i\" and \"j\", we show the corrected PA around rotations\n\"A\" and \"B\". The open squares denote the corrected PA\nof the J-band data. They apparently show different behavior from the V -band PA (the filled circles). However,\nthey becomes consistent if \u2212180 or \u2212360 deg is added to\nthe J-band PA. It demonstrates that the V - and J-band\ndata have the same behavior if the \u00b1180 deg ambiguity\nin PA is taken into account.\nRotation rates of \"A\" and \"B\" were estimated as\n\u221226\u00b12.3 and +9.8\u00b10.5 deg d\u22121 , calculated by a linear regression model of PA. If the rotation rate is positive, the\nrotation direction is counterclockwise in the QU plane, or\nthe celestial sphere, and vice versa.

Thus,\nthe directions of these two rotation were different.\nFigure 4 shows the light curve and temporal variations\nof polarization parameters during the outburst state in\nthe V band. The solid line was the best-fitted linear function for the corrected PA from JD 2455157 to 2455192.\nIn the fourth panel, we show the residual PA from the\nlinear function. The PD was low during the early phase\nof the outburst. After the outburst maximum, it became\nhigh. The residual PA was largely deviated from zero\naround JD 2455170 (the forth panel of figure 4). Around\nthis deviation epoch, the V band magnitude was at the\nmaximum (the top panel of figure 4) and the PDV was\nminimum (\u223c 2 %; the second panel of figure 4).\n3.3.\n\nSpectrum in the NIR band and spectral energy distribution\n\nWe also obtained the NIR spectroscopic data with\nAKARI/IRC during the outburst state.

The bottom panel shows\nthe averaged spectrum of three spectra.\n\ndicating that the synchrotron radiation was dominant in\nthis wavelength range during the outburst state.\nWe show the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the\nobject from the radio to optical regions during the outburst state in figure 5. The NIR data points are the average flux for three epochs obtained with AKARI. As for\nthe optical data, the figure includes the observation with\nKanata which was obtained on JD 2455180, closest to the\nAKARI observations. In the radio band, we use public data observed with the Submillimeter Array (SMA;\n1 mm on JD 2455181 and 850 \u03bcm on JD 2455176 ), the\nthe University of Michigan Radio Astronomy Observatory\n(UMRAO; 4.8 on JD 2455169.5, 8.0 on JD 2455184.5 and\n14.5 GHz on JD 2455179.5) and our data observed with\nthe Yamaguchi radio telescope (8.38 GHz on JD 2455172).\nAll radio data are obtained within 10 d of our AKARI\nobservations. The SMA data was obtained as part of\nthe SMA flux density monitoring program and used by\npermission (Gurwell et al. 2007). The optical and NIR\ndata were corrected for the Galactic interstellar extinction based on Schlegel et al. (1998). The extinction for\nthe AKARI data were estimated by interpolating the extinctions from 3 to 5 \u03bcm obtained from Schlegel et al.\n(1998). The solid line represents the best fitted third-order\nlog-polynomial function. The peak frequency of the synchrotron component was estimated as 7.6\u00d71012 Hz. This\nis the same order of magnitude as the values reported in\nprevious studies (e.g. Raiteri et al. 2008b; Abdo et al.\n2010b). The optical and NIR data are smoothly connected, which suggests that at least the emission from\nthe NIR to optical energy band can be explained by a\nsynchrotron component.\n4.\n4.1.\n\nDiscussion\nImplication of polarimetric behavior during an outburst state in 2009\n\nOur monitoring observations suggest that two rotation\nevents of polarization occurred during the active and outburst states of 3C 454.3 in 2009. The features of the\n\n\f-2 -1\n-11\n\n\u03bdF\u03bdV (x10\n\nrotation \"A\" and \"B\" were summarized in table 1. The\nrotation rates, directions and periods of the rotations are\ndifferent between the rotation \"A\" and \"B\".\nTwo models have recently been proposed for the rotation of polarization; Marscher et al. (2008) and Abdo et al.\n(2010a). According to Marscher et al. (2008), a rotation of\nthe polarization vector is a sign of helical magnetic field in\nthe jet. The directions of the rotation events in 3C 454.3\nare both clockwise and counterclockwise. In the case of\nthe simple helical magnetic field in the jet, the direction\nof the rotation of polarization should be one-side. Thus,\nit needs more complex magnetic field structure in order\nto explain the rotation events in 3C 454.3.\nAbdo et al. (2010a) reported a rotation event in 3C 279,\nand suggested a non-axisymmetric structure of the jet,\nimplying a curved trajectory for the emitting material.\nThis idea can explain rotations in both directions, and\nhence, the rotations in 3C 454.3. We can estimate the\ndistance, \u2206 r, traveled by the emitting material during the\nwell-sampled rotation \"B\" in 2009. We calculate the travel\ndistance \u2206 r as \u03932jet c \u2206 t, where \u0393jet is the bulk Lorentz\nfactor, c is the speed of light and \u2206 t is the duration of\nthe rotation event (Abdo et al. 2010a). The duration of\nthe rotation \"B\" was 35 d. In this case, we adopt a values\nof \u0393jet = 19.6 which was reported by Bonnoli et al. (2011)\nwith the data on JD 2455167.5 (2 Dec. 2009). Thus, we\ncalculate \u2206 r \u2248 3.5 \u00d7 1019 cm. The travel distance of our\nresult was the same order of magnitude compared with\nthat for 3C 279 reported in Abdo et al. (2010a). On the\nother hand, the duration of the rotation \"A\" was shorter\nthan that of the rotation \"B\". Thus, the travel distance\nof the rotation \"A\" could be shorter than that of \"B\" if\n\u0393jet in the active state is same or smaller than that in the\noutburst state.\nSasada et al. (2011) reported that there was a positive\ncorrelation between the amplitudes of the flux and PD\nof flares in 41 blazars. The large-amplitude variations in\nthe flux and PD were shown in the outburst state. Thus,\nthere was a positive correlation between the amplitudes of\nthe flux and PD in the outburst state of 3C 454.3, which\nwas consistent with the positive correlation in blazar flares\nfound by Sasada et al. (2011).\nThe peak of the PD was delayed by 10 d from the peak\nof the flux in the outburst. This behavior might be explained by the following simple geometrical effect scenario.\nLaing (1980) suggest that the PD is the highest when the\nline-of-sight is parallel to the shock plane in the co-moving\nframe. In this assumption, the observed flux from the jet\nis low because of a low Doppler factor. When the line-ofsight is perpendicular to the shock plane, the observed flux\nis high because of a high Doppler factor, and PD is low\nbecause the magnetic field direction is not aligned. Hence,\nin this scheme, if the shock comes toward us just after its\nformation then the shock plane gradually inclines with respect to line-of-sight, the PD rises up after the flux peak.\nIt should be noted that the Doppler factor is changed in\nthis scenario. The Doppler factor during the 2009 outburst was estimated with multi-wavelength spectral models, which indicate that the Doppler factor \u03b4 was almost\n\nerg cm s )\n\nMulti-wavelength photopolarimetric monitoring of 3C 454.3 in Dec. 2009\n\ncor.

The observed flux,\nF\u03bd, obs , from the shocked region depends strongly on \u03b4,\nas F\u03bd, obs \u221d \u03b4 3+\u03b1 , where \u03b1 is a spectral index. During the\nperiod of rotation \"B\" (JD 2455157\u20132455192), the maximum and minimum V -band flux were 6.501 and 1.658\n\u00d710\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , indicating the flux changed by a\nfactor of 3.9. However, the amplitude of the flux variation\nshould be larger than that, because the J-band flux variation was larger than that in the V band. If we explain all\nthe flux variation only by the variation in \u03b4, \u03b4 should be\nchanged at least by a factor of 1.4, assuming the spectral\nindex, \u03b1 = 1. This is, however, apparently inconsistent\nwith the result from SED modeling that it was constant\nwithin \u03b4 \u223c 24.5\u201328.5. Thus, it would be difficult to explain the observation only by the variation in \u03b4. More\ndetailed and complex jet modeling would be needed for\ninterpreting the behaviors of the flux and polarization in\nthe outburst state.\n4.2.\n\nComparison in five rotation events\n\nOther rotation events were also reported in active states\nof 3C 454.3 in 2005 and 2007. Jorstad et al. (2010) reported that the optical outbursts in 2005 autumn and in\n2007 were accompanied by systematic rotation of the PA.\nSasada et al. (2010) also reported a rotation event in the\n2007 outburst.\nIn 2008, 3C 454.3 had an outburst in the radio, optical,\nX-ray and gamma-ray bands (Abdo et al. 2009 ; Villata\net al. 2009b). We also monitored the object during the\n2008 outburst with Kanata/TRISPEC in multi-color photometric and polarimetric mode. Figure 6 shows the light\ncurve and temporal variation of the corrected PA in the V\nband in 2008 and 2009. The object reached its outburst\nmaximum on \u223cJD 2454664. The object stayed active even\nafter the maximum, until \u223cJD 2454760, and then it returned to quiescence. In the lower panel of figure 6, we\ncan see a gradual decreasing trend of the PA just after\nthe outburst maximum, which apparently continued until\n\n\f8\n\nM. Sasada et al.\nTable 1.

(2010) and Sasada et al. (2010).\n\nthe object returned to quiescence. In addition, there is a\nsign of a rapid and short rotation of polarization between\nJD 2454680 and 2454691, as indicated with the filled circle\nin figure 6.\nTo date, five rotation events of polarization were reported in 3C 454.3 during its active and outburst states\nin 2005, 2007, 2008 and 2009. We summarize their rotation rates, total degree of the rotation in table 1. We also\nshow the periods of the rotation events, which we used\nfor estimating the rotation rates. Three rotation rates are\npositive values and two rates are negative. Thus, there are\nnot only counterclockwise, but also clockwise directions of\nthe PA rotations. Another feature of the rotation events\nis that there seems to be two types of events; fast rotation\nevents (2007, 2008 and 2009 \"A\") and slow rotation events\n(2005 and 2009 \"B\"). The fast ones have the absolute rate\nof the rotation larger than 20 deg d\u22121 , whereas the slow\nones have the value smaller than 10 deg d\u22121 . Time durations of two types of rotations are different. The fast ones\nhave short durations, less than 11 d, and the slow rotation\n\"B\" in 2009 has a long duration, 35 d. It could partly be\nan observational bias because it is difficult to detect short\nand slow rotation events. However, it is worth nothing\nthat there was not any long and fast rotation from 2007\nto 2009.\nOne possibility is that the fast rotation is the result of\nan erratic behavior of the polarization vector. Villforth\net al. (2010) reported that the polarization vector can be\nseparated into two components: an optical polarization\ncore and chaotic jet emission. If the chaotic polarization\ncomponent with a short timescale moves around the origin\nof the QU plane, a short fast rotation can occur. Ikejiri\net al. (2011) also discussed that a rotation episode indicated only by a few data points cannot be distinguished\nfrom results of a random walk in the QU plane.\n5.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe performed the photometric and polarimetric\nmonitoring of 3C 454.3 during 2009-2010. The object\nshowed the active and outburst states in the optical\nand near-infrared light curves and two rotation events\nin the temporal variations of polarization. In the past\nand our polarimetric monitoring, five rotation events\nwere reported in 3C 454.3. The rotations were observed\nin both clockwise and counterclockwise directions in\n\n[Vol. ,\n\nthe QU plane. The complex model of the structure of\nthe magnetic field in the jet is needed to explain these\nrotation events.\nThis work was partly supported by a Grand-in-Aid\nfrom the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science,\nand Technology of Japan (22540252,).
