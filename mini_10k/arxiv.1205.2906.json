This problem\nhas practical applications such as the design of zenithally\nbistable devices [4\u20138], or the trapping of colloidal particles in specified sites [9, 10]. It is well known that the\nnematic director field, in presence of the structured substrate, may be distorted, leading to an elastic contribution to the free energy. Since the seminal work by Berreman [11, 12], this problem has been extensively studied and generalized in the literature [4, 13\u201326]. Wetting\nand filling transitions by nematic on these grooved surfaces have also been studied [27\u201330]. When the substrate\npresents cusps, topological defect nucleate on them [13\u2013\n15, 25, 26], and Berreman's expression of the elastic contribution to the free-energy density, which is proportional\nto the wavenumber of the substrate structure q, breaks\ndown because of the emergence of a non-analytical contribution proportional to \u2212q ln q associated to the nucleated defects [26]. This result constrasts with the phenomenology observed in smooth substrates, as sinuosidal\nsubstrates, where in absence of topological defects a suitable generalization of Berreman's model works [23, 30].\nIn this paper we will complete the characterization of\nthe elastic contribution to the surface free-energy density for sawtoothed substrates [26]. Beyond the \u2212q ln q\nterm previously mentioned, we find that the next-toleading contribution follows Berreman's scaling with the\nwavenumber q. The origin of this term is twofold: the\ndeviations of the nematic director field with respect to\nthe distortions imposed by the presence of the nucleated\ndisclination lines, and the defect core contributions. We\nestimate both contributions, finding a fairly good agreement with the reported values in Ref. [26].\nThe paper is organized as follows. The problem is set\n\nup in Section II, where we identify the different contributions to the elastic contribution to the surface free-energy\ndensity. Sections III and IV are devoted to the estimation of these contributions, and the obtained results will\nbe discussed in Section IV. We will end up with the conclusions in Section V.\n\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nWe consider a nematic liquid in contact with a sawtooth substrate characterized by the angle \u03b1 and the\nlength side L (see Fig. 1). The substrate favours\nhomeotropic anchoring of the molecules. We assume\ntraslational symmetry along z axis and a periodic distribution of wedges and cusps along the x axis. Under these\nconditions, the nematic director field n(r) shows only inplane distortions [26], so it can be parametrized by using\nthe angle \u03b8 between the local director and the y axis,\nyielding n(r) = (\u2212 sin \u03b8(r), cos \u03b8(r), 0). Far from the\nsubstrate, the bulk nematic phase orients homogeneously\nalong either the x axis (perpendicular texture N \u22a5 ) or the\ny axis (parallel texture N k ). The nematic order of the\nsystem can be locally represented by a traceless symmetric order parameter second-rank tensor Q, with Cartesian\ncomponents Qij = 23 S[ni nj \u2212 31 \u03b4ij ] + 21 B[li lj \u2212 mi mj ],\nwhere S is the nematic order parameter, which measures\nthe orientational ordering along the nematic director, and\nB the biaxiality parameter, which measures the ordering\nof the molecules on the orientations perpendicular to n,\ncharacterized by the eigenvectors l and m.\nAs in previous works [26, 28, 29], the system will be described within the Landau-de Gennes (LdG) framework.\nThe order parameter tensor profile is obtained by mini-\n\n\f2\nmizing the surface free-energy density functional\n!\n\"\nZ\nZ \u221e\n1 \u03bb/2\n3 \u2212 2\u03c4 2 Tr Q\u03032\nF=\n\u22121\ndx\ndy\n\u03bb \u2212\u03bb/2\n4\u03c4 \u2212 3\n3\n|x| tan \u03b1\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n4\n4\n\u03c4\n2\nTr Q\u03033 \u2212 1 +\n[Tr Q\u03032 ]2 \u2212 1\n\u2212\n4\u03c4 \u2212 3 3\n4\u03c4 \u2212 3 9\n#\n1\n+\n[\u2202k Q\u0303ij \u2202k Q\u0303ij + \u03ba\u2202j Q\u0303ij \u2202k Q\u0303ik ]\n3 + 2\u03ba\nZ\n2\n1 \u03bb/2\n(1)\ndx w Tr[Q\u0303 * Q\u0303surf ]\n\u2212\n\u03bb \u2212\u03bb/2 3\ny=|x| tan \u03b1\n\nAt coexistence \u03c4 = 1, and Eq.

[26]. For\nthis purporse, the functional Eq. (1) was numerically\nminimized by using a conjugate-gradient method. The\nnumerical discretization of the continuum problem is performed with a finite element method [31] combined with\nadaptive meshing in order to resolve the different length\nscales that may emerge in the problem [32]. It was found\nthat the N \u22a5 texture has lower free energy if \u03b1 < \u03c0/4\nowing to lesser distortion. Conversely, the N k texture\nhas lower free energy for \u03b1 > \u03c0/4, in agreement with\nearlier predictions [13\u201315, 25]. For large wL, strong anchoring conditions are effectively achieved, leading to the\nnucleation of disclination lines characterized by non-halfinteger winding numbers along the ridges and wedges of\nthe substrate [13\u201315, 25, 26]. As a consequence, the elastic contribution to the surface free-energy density has the\nfollowing scaling [26]\n\nwhere \u03bb \u2261 2L cos \u03b1 is the substrate periodicity wavelength, Q\u0303 = Q/Sb , where Sb = Sb (T ) is the bulk value\nof the nematic order parameter at the temperature T ,\nand \u03c4 = Sb (T )/Sb (TN I ) is the ratio between the nematic order parameter at the temperature T and the\nnematic-isotropic transition temperature\nTN I . The po\u221a\nsitions are measured in units of 2\u03be, where \u03be is the\nnematic correlation length along the local nematic director axis. Finally \u03ba is the ratio between the relevant elastic parameters (\u03ba > \u22123/2) and w the (reduced)\nanchoring strength. Homeotropic alignment of the nematic is favoured by setting Q\u0303surf = (3\u03bd \u2297 \u03bd \u2212 1)/2,\nK(\u03b1)\nq cos \u03b1\nq\nfelastic \u2248 \u2212\nq ln\n+\nB(\u03b1, w)\n(5)\nbeing \u03bd = ((x/|x|) sin \u03b1, \u2212 cos \u03b1, 0) the outwards nor2\u03c0\n\u03c0\n2\u03c0\nmal vector to the substrate.

The value of S\u0303(0) is obtained\nthe substrate, but at distances larger than Rc from any\nas the largest solution of the equation:\nsubstrate ridge.

On the other hand, we anticipate\nthat this analysis will give us some insight in the different contributions to B(\u03b1, w).\nWe start with the minimization of region III. As it\nwas argued in Ref. [26], large wL leads to strong anchoring conditions. So, in order to minimize the surface\nfree-energy density, we impose to the angle field \u03b8(r) to be\nconstant along its boundary, so the nematic director field\nis homogeneous and equal to the normal to the substrate.\nConsequently, the minimization of the free-energy functional in this region will lead to a homogeneous director\nfield normal to the substrate, although the nematic order\nparameter S at each point will depend on its distance to\nthe substrate. We impose the following fixed boundary\nconditions for S: S = Sb at the boundary between regions\nI and III, and the equilibrium nematic order parameter\nprofile for the flat wall case at the boundary between\nregions II and III. Assuming that \u03b7 is large enough,\nthis situation is completely equivalent to the flat case, so\nthe minimum value of the surface free-energy density in\nthis region, fIII , will be \u03c3N W (1 \u2212 2Rc /L)/ cos \u03b1, with\ncorrections of order of exp(\u2212\u03b7/\u03be). Next Sections will be\ndevoted to the evaluation of the minimum values of the\nsurface free-energy functionals at the remaining regions,\nfI and fII .\n\n[26]:\nfI\n\nEVALUATION OF fI\n\nThe variations of S are restricted to the neighborhood\nof the substrate of a width typically of order of \u03be, and\ninside the defect cores. So, in region I, S takes the bulk\nvalue Sb everywhere [26]. Thus, the surface free-energy\nfunctional to minimize in region I reduces to a FrankOseen functional:\nZ\nK\nFI \u2248\ndxdy|\u2207\u03b8|2\n(7)\n2\u03bb I\nwhere the integration is restricted to region I, K is the reduced elastic constant, and \u03b8 is the orientation field. The\nminimization of Eq. (7) yields to the Laplace equation\nfor \u03b8, \u22072 \u03b8(r) = 0. In the far field, we impose Dirichlet\nboundary conditions limy\u2192\u221e \u03b8(r) = \u03b1\u221e , where \u03b1\u221e = 0\nfor the N \u22a5 texture and \u03b1\u221e = \u03c0/2 for the N k texture.\nAlong the contours x = \u00b1\u03bb/2, we should impose periodic boundary conditions. However, we impose instead\nDirichlet boundary conditions \u03b8 = \u03b1\u221e along these contours, as we know from the full LdG model minimization\nthat these are the conditions satisfied by the mean-field\nsolution [26]. Finally, we assume strong anchoring conditions along the boundary between regions I and III:\n\u03b8(x, y = x2 tan \u03b1/|x|, z) = \u03b1\u221e + (x/|x|)(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1\u221e ). As discussed above, this condition will be accurate if wL \u226b 1.\nTheir contribution to the free-energy density, fI , comes\nfrom a contour integration of the mean-field solution via\n\nZ\n\nC1\n\n\u03bd * \u2207\u03b8ds\n\n(8)\n\nwhere C1 is the contour parallel to the boundary between\nregions I and III between a wedge and apex (see Fig.\n1).\nAs argued in Refs. [13\u201315, 26], the presence of cusps in\nthe substrate induces the formation of disclination lines,\nwhich are the responsible of the non-Berreman scaling of\nthe elastic contribution to the surface free-energy density.\nIn this Section, we will complete that analysis, evaluating\nthe next-to-leading contribution.\nA.\n\nSingular contribution\n\nThe solution \u03b8(r) to the Laplace equation subject to\nthe boundary conditions mentioned above can be split\ninto two terms: a singular contribution \u03b8s (r) due to the\nperiodic array of disclination lines nucleated at the ridges\nof the substrate, and a non-singular contribution \u03b8ns (r).\nA representation of the singular contribution for each texture is given by [26]:\nh\nqx\nqy i\n\u2212 arctan tan\ncoth\n2\n2\n!\nh\nqx i\n(9)\n+ arctan tan\n2\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03b1\nqx\nq(y \u2212 L sin \u03b1)\n+ \u03c0\n\u2212 arctan tan\ntanh\n2\n2\n2 +\u03b1\n!\nh\nqx i\n+ arctan tan\n2\n\n\u03b8s\u22a5 =\nIII.\n\nK(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1\u221e )\n=\n\u03bb\n\n\u2212\u03b1\n\u03c0\n2 \u2212\u03b1\n\n\u03c0\n+\n2\n\nh\nqx\nqy i\n\u2212 arctan tan\ncoth\n2\n2\n!\nh\nqx i\n+ arctan tan\n(10)\n2\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03c0\nq(y \u2212 L sin \u03b1)\nqx\n2 \u2212\u03b1\ntanh\n\u2212 \u03c0\n\u2212 arctan tan\n2\n2\n2 +\u03b1\n!\nh\ni\nqx\n+ arctan tan\n2\n\n\u03b8sk =\n\nTheir contribution to the free-energy density, fIs , comes\nfrom a contour integration of these solutions:\nZ\nK(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1\u221e )\n\u03bd * \u2207\u03b8s ds\n(11)\nfIs =\n\u03bb\nC1\nIn Ref. [26] it was estimated the large-L behaviour of Eq.\n(11), leading to the non-Berreman term K(\u03b1)q ln(L/Rc )\nterm. However, after some algebra it is possible to obtain\n\n\f4\nexplicitely fIs from the solutions Eqs. (9) and (10) via\nEq.(11) as:\nh\n\u0010\u03c0\n\u0011i\n\u0011\nK(\u03b1)q \u0010\n\u2212 ln qRc + ln 2 cosh\ntan \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1 tan \u03b1\n2\u03c0\n2\n(12)\nwhere K(\u03b1) depends on the texture and substrate geometry as Eq. (6) and we neglected terms of order q 3 (Rc )2\nand q\u03b7. As the dependence on the nematic texture comes\nfrom K(\u03b1), fIs will be minimum for the N \u22a5 (resp. N k )\ntexture for \u03b1 < \u03c0/4 (resp. \u03b1 > \u03c0/4).\nTwo remarks are pertinent at this point. First, we note\nthat, although fIs may depend on the explicit representation of the singular solution, the leading non-Berreman\ncontribution is independent on this representation. The\nreason for this fact is that this leading contribution arises\nfrom the behaviour close to the wedges and apexes of \u03b8s ,\nwhich must asymptotically approach to the corresponding to an isolated disclination line [26]. Secondly, the\nnext-to-leading contribution gives a first contribution to\nB(\u03b1, w), which we will denote as BI,s (\u03b1), given by the\nexpression:\n\u0012 \u0014\n\u0015\n\u0013\n\u0010\u03c0\n\u0011\n2\nBI,s (\u03b1) = K(\u03b1) ln\ncosh\ntan \u03b1 cos \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1 tan \u03b1\n\u03c0\n2\n(13)\n\nfIs =\n\nB.\n\nNon-singular contribution\n\nThe non-singular part of the mean-field solution, \u03b8ns ,\nis solution of the Laplace equation \u22072 \u03b8ns = 0, subject\nto the boundary conditions \u03b8ns = 0 in the far field, i.e.\ny \u2192 \u221e and along the boundaries x = \u00b1\u03bb/2. On the\nother hand, \u03b8ns = \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b8s along C1 . We do not have an\nexplicit expression for \u03b8ns (however, there is an implicit\nexpression via a Schwarz-Christoffel transformation [13],\nsee below), so we have to resort to numerical methods.\nWe have used two different techniques: a finite element\nmethod, analogous to the method outlined in the Section II to solve the LdG model, but minimizing instead\nthe functional Eq. (7) subject to the boundary conditions for \u03b8ns mentioned above; and as an alternative, the\nboundary element method [33, 34]. In this technique the\nsolution \u03b8ns inside the region I can be written as:\n\u03b8ns (r) =\n\nI\n\n\u2202I\n\nds [\u03bd(s) * \u2207s \u03b8ns (s)]G(s, r)\n\n\u2212\u03b8ns (s) [\u03bd(s) * \u2207s G(s, r)]\n\n!\n\n(14)\n\nwhere the contour integral over the boundary \u2202I of region\nI is counter-clockwise, \u03bd(s) is the outwards normal to the\nboundary at s and G(s, r) is the fundamental solution of\nthe Laplace equation G(s, r) = \u2212 ln (|s \u2212 r|) /2\u03c0. As we\nimpose Dirichlet boundary conditions, the second term\nin the right-hand side of Eq. (14) is known. On the\n\nother hand, the normal derivative of \u03b8ns at the boundary\nis obtained by solving the integral equation [33, 34]:\nI\n\u03b8ns (r)\nds[\u03bd(s) * \u2207s \u03b8ns (s)]G(s, r) =\n2\n\u2202I\nI\nds\u03b8ns (s) [\u03bd(s) * \u2207s G(s, r)]\n(15)\n+\n\u2202I\n\nwhere now r \u2208 \u2202I. In order to solve Eq. (15), we discretize the boundary in a set of straight segments (the\nboundary elements). We use the constant boundary element approach [34], so we assume that both \u03b8ns and its\nnormal derivative are constants along each boundary element. Introducing this approximation to Eq. (15), we\nobtain a set of linear algebraic equations for the normal\nderivatives of \u03b8ns . Once we solve this set of equations,\nand introducing the same approximation in Eq. (14) we\nobtain the non-singular orientational field \u03b8ns inside region I.\nOnce evaluated \u03b8ns , its contribution to the surface freeenergy density can be obtained from:\nZ\nK(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1\u221e )\nfIns =\n\u03bd * \u2207\u03b8ns ds\n(16)\n\u03bb\nC1\nZ\nZ\nK\nK\n(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b8s (s))\u03bd * \u2207\u03b8s ds\n(17)\ndr|\u2207\u03b8ns |2 +\n=\n2\u03bb I\n\u03bb C1\nwhere the first result is more appropriated for the boundary element technique, while the second is more appropriate for the finite element method (note that the last\nterm in the second result can be evaluated numerically\nwith high accuracy by standard methods as we know analytically \u03b8s (r)).\nThe numerical minimization is performed in the cell\nshown in Fig. 2. In order to minimize finite-size effects,\nthe cell height H is taken to be at least four times the\nvalue of L (note that \u03b8s decays exponentially to \u03b1\u221e for\ny \u226b 2L cos \u03b1/\u03c0). We checked that the value of \u03bbfIns\nis independent of \u03bb, as expected, so the non-singular\ncontribution to B(\u03b1, w), BI,ns (\u03b1), is related to fIns via\nBI,ns (\u03b1) = \u03bbfIns . The numerical results are shown for\nboth the N \u22a5 and N k textures in Fig. 3. The agreement between the results obtained from the finite element\nmethod and boundary element method is excellent, as for\nthe evaluation of \u03b8ns (r), which takes non-negligible values only above the contour C1 and vanishes close to the\nwedges and apexes (see Fig. 4). Our results show that\nthe non-singular contribution corresponding to the N \u22a5\n(resp. N k ) texture is smaller than the contribution associated to the N k (resp. N \u22a5 ) texture for \u03b1 < \u03c0/4 (resp.\n\u03b1 > \u03c0/4).\nC.\n\nExact evaluation of fI\n\nIn the previous paragraphs we have outlined how to\nobtain \u03b8(r) = \u03b8s (r) + \u03b8ns (r), and from that, to obtain\nfI = fIs + fIns , as well as BI (\u03b1) = BI,s (\u03b1) + BI,ns (\u03b1).\n\n\f5\nHowever, it is possible to obtain fI directly without\nknowing the explicit form of \u03b8(r) by using a SchwarzChristoffel transformation [13, 37]:\nZ\nC\nz = d\u03b6\u0304\n2\u03b1/\u03c0\n1/2\u2212\u03b1/\u03c0\n\u03b6\u0303\n(\u03b6\u0303 \u2212 1)1/2\u2212\u03b1/\u03c0\n(\u03b6\u0303 + 1)\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 \u03b1 1 \u03b1 3 \u03b1 2\n\u2032 1\u2212 2\u03b1\n\u2032\u2032\n\u03c0\n=C\u03b6\n\u2212 , \u2212 , \u2212 , \u03b6 + C(18)\n2 F1\n2 \u03c0 2 \u03c0 2 \u03c0\nwhere z = x + iy, 2 F1 (a, b, c, z) is the Gauss hypergeometric function and C, C \u2032 and C \u2032\u2032 complex constants.\nThis conformal transformation maps the minimization\ncell for H \u2192 \u221e into the upper half \u03b6-plane (see Fig.\n2), transforming the origin into the origin and the edges\nz = \u00b1L cos \u03b1 + iL sin \u03b1 into \u03b6 = \u00b11, respectively. These\nconditions fix the values of C \u2032 and C \u2032\u2032 , so the SchwarzChristoffel transformation finally reads:\nz=\n\n\u0393\n\u0012\n\n\u00d72 F1\n\n3\n2\n\nLei\u03b1\n\u0001\n\u2212\u03b1\n\u03c0 \u0393\n\n1\n2\n\n+\n\n\u03b1\n\u03c0\n\n\u0001 \u03b6 1\u2212\n\n2\u03b1\n\u03c0\n\n1 \u03b1 1 \u03b1 3 \u03b1 2\n\u2212 , \u2212 , \u2212 ,\u03b6\n2 \u03c0 2 \u03c0 2 \u03c0\n\n\u0013\n\n(19)\n\nwhere \u0393(x) is the gamma function. Eq. (19) can be\nformally inverted, so \u03b6 = \u03b6(z/L; \u03b1) = x\u2032 (x/L, y/L; \u03b1) +\niy \u2032 (x/L, y/L; \u03b1). We will consider the limit \u03b7/L \u2192 0, and\nRc /L small but finite. In this approach, the boundary\nof zone II becomes under the Schwarz-Christoffel transformation the real axis in the \u03b6-plane, rounded around\n\u03b6 = 0 and \u00b11. The expansion of Eq. (19) around these\nvalues show that the circles of radii Rc around the origin\nand the edges z = \u00b1L cos \u03b1+iL sin \u03b1 map into circles (up\nto corrections of order of (Rc /L)2 ) of radii \u01eb1 for \u03b6 = \u00b11\nand \u01eb2 for \u03b6 = 0 given by:\n\u0013 1 +1 \u03b1 \u0012\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0015 \u0014\n\u0015\u0013 1 1 \u03b1\n+\nRc\n1 1 + 2\u03b1\n3 \u03b1\n1 \u03b1\n2\n\u03c0\n2\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u01eb1 =\n\u0393\n\u2212\n+\n\u0393\n2\u03b1\n2 1\u2212 \u03c0\nL\n2 \u03c0\n2 \u03c0\n\u0012\n\u0015 \u0014\n\u0015\u0013 12\u03b1\n\u0014\n1\u2212\nRc\n1 \u03b1\n3 \u03b1\n\u03c0\n\u01eb2 =\n(20)\n\u0393\n\u0393\n\u2212\n+\nL\n2 \u03c0\n2 \u03c0\nAs the Schwarz-Christoffel transformation is conformal,\nand \u03b8(r) is harmonic, we are going to find the solution\nto the Laplace equation in the half \u03b6-plane, \u03b8\u0303, subject\nto the boundary conditions \u03b8\u0303 = \u03b1\u221e for |x\u2032 | > 1 + \u01eb1 ,\nand \u03b8\u0303 = \u03b1\u221e + (x\u2032 /|x\u2032 |)(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1\u221e ) for \u01eb2 < |x\u2032 | < 1 \u2212 \u01eb1 .\nThe solution \u03b8\u0303(x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) in the image of the region I on the\n\u03b6-plane, I \u2032 , is given by [13]:\n\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1\u221e\ny\u2032\narctan \u2032\n\u03c0\nx \u22121\n2(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1\u221e )\n\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1\u221e\ny\u2032\ny\u2032\n\u2212\narctan \u2032 +\narctan \u2032\n(21)\n\u03c0\nx\n\u03c0\nx +1\n\u03b8\u0303(x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) = \u03b1\u221e +\n\nFrom the solution \u03b8\u0303, we can obtain \u03b8(x, y) =\n\u03b8\u0303[x\u2032 (x/L, y/L; \u03b1), y \u2032 (x/L, y/L; \u03b1)].

(24) and the results obtained in the previous subsections, except close\nto \u03b1 = \u03c0/2. The latter may be due to numerical uncertainties in the evaluation of BI,ns , since either it diverges\n(N \u22a5 texture) or vanishes (N k texture) in that limit. As\nhappened for BI,s , the dependence on the texture comes\nfrom K(\u03b1), leading to the same conclusions about the\nrelative stability of the nematic textures with the angle\n\u03b1, in agreement with the results obtained in Ref. [13].\nIV.\n\nEVALUATION OF fII\n\nIn Ref. [26] it was observed that there is a dependence\non w of the next-to-leading contribution to the surface\nfree-energy density. However, in the previous Section we\nhave shown that the contribution from region I only depends on \u03b1. So, we anticipate that this dependence comes\nfrom region II, where inhomogoneities of both the nematic order parameter S and orientational \u03b8 fields are\nobserved.\nThe free energy of region II can be evaluated as the\nsum of the contributions of the regions around each cusp\n(either wedge or apex). In each of these regions and if\nRc \u226a L, we anticipate that the orientational field far\nfrom the cusp behaves asymptotically as that of the isolated disclination line which has been nucleated at the\nsubstrate wedge or apex: \u03b8 \u223c I\u03c6, where I is the topological charge of the disclination line and (r, \u03c6) are the\npolar coordinates taking as origin the cusp. The values of I are fixed by the (strong) anchoring conditions\n\n\f6\non the substrate and depend on the nematic texture:\nI1 = \u2212\u03b1/(\u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03b1) (resp. I1 = +1) at the wedge bottom\nand I2 = \u03b1/(\u03c0/2 + \u03b1) (resp. \u2212(\u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03b1)/(\u03c0/2 + \u03b1)) at\nthe apexes for the N \u22a5 (resp. N k ) [13, 26]. However, S\ndecreases from the bulk value far from the origin and vanishes as r \u2192 0 in order to remove the free-energy singularity associated to the defect core. Although we cannot\nsolve analytically this problem, we can estimate using an\nansatz the free energy associated to this combined distortion of \u03b8 and S, as shown in the Appendix. However, we\nresort here to a full minimization of the LdG model Eq.\n(1) restricted to region II. At r = Rc , we impose Dirichlet boundary conditions to Q, where S takes the value\ncorresponding to the order-parameter profile corresponding to a planar wall at the distance between the boundary\npoint and the closest substrate, the biaxiality parameter\nB = 0 and \u03b8 = \u03b1\u221e + I(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c0/2). Alternatively we used\nfree boundary conditions \u03bd * \u2207Q = 0, leading to similar\nresults. Fig. 6 shows typical textures obtained after minimization. At distances r larger than a few correlation\nlengths, S decays to the bulk value except in the neighbourhood of the substrates, where takes approximately\nthe value corresponding to the flat substrate profile. On\nthe other hand, the orientational field deforms continuously in order to satisfy anchoring conditions on each\nside of the wedge or the apex. So, we anticipate that the\ncontribution to the surface free-energy density fII will\nscale with Rc as:\n\u03bbfII = 4\u03c3nw Rc + K(\u03b1) ln Rc + BII\n\n(25)\n\nThe first contribution arises from the inhomogeneities of\nS close to the substrates, and the second one from the\nasymptotic behaviour of \u03b8 for r > 1: by using the FrankOseen functional Eq. (7), and taking into account that\n\u2207\u03b8 = Iu\u03c6 /r (where u\u03c6 is the azimuthal unit vector),\nwe find that the free-energy contribution is proportional\nto (K/2)I 2 \u2206\u03c6 ln Rc , where \u2206\u03c6 is the opening angle of\nthe wedge or apex. From this result we get the second\ncontribution in Eq. (25) by noting that K(\u03b1) = KI12 (\u03c0 \u2212\n2\u03b1)/2 + KI22 (\u03c0 + 2\u03b1)/2. The remaining contribution will\ngive the core free energy per unit length associated to the\ndisclination lines.\nExpression (25) can be used to extract BII from the\nnumerical minimization. So, fixing the value of \u03b1, and\nfor each w (between 0 and 1.5) we considered a range of\nvalues of Rc between 10 and 90. The minimization was\nperformed by the mesh-adaptive finite-element method\nused previously [32], taking \u03c4 = 1 and \u03ba = 2 (this choice\nis motivated to compare with results reported in the literature [26, 28]). After substrating 4\u03c3nw Rc to \u03bbfII , the\nnumerical results clearly show a logarithmic dependence\non Rc , with a slope approximately equal to K(\u03b1) (see\nleft panel in Fig. 7). Next step was to substract the subdominant contribution K(\u03b1) ln R\u221e . Now the numerical\nresults are nearly independent of Rc (see right panel in\nFig. 7). The value of BII is estimated as the mean value\nof these results, with an errorbar given by the dispersion\nof the numerical data around the average.\n\nV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe results obtained in the previous Sections can be\ncombined as follows:\nf = fI + fII + fIII =\n\n\u03c3N W\n+ felastic\ncos \u03b1\n\n(26)\n\nwhere\n\"\nq\nq cos \u03b1\nfelastic =\nK(\u03b1) \u2212 ln\n2\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u0013 \u0012\u03c0\n\u0012\n\u0013\n+\u03b1\n1 \u03b1\nln \u03c02\n\u2212\n\u2212\n2 \u03c0\n2 \u2212\u03b1\n\u0015 \u0014\n\u0015\u0013 #\n\u0012 \u0014\n1 \u03b1\n3 \u03b1\n\u0393\n\u2212 ln \u0393\n\u2212\n+\n2 \u03c0\n2 \u03c0\nq\n+ BII (\u03b1, w)\n2\u03c0\n\n(27)\n\nup to corrections of order of q 2 .

Now we can check\nthis prediction by comparing these results with those obtained from the full minimization of the LdG model of a\nnematic in contact with a sawtoothed substrate [26]. Fig.\n8 shows the comparison between the results reported in\nthe Ref. [26] (\u03c4 = 1, \u03ba = 2) and the calculated ones\nin this paper for \u03b1 = \u03c0/6 (N \u22a5 texture) and \u03b1 = \u03c0/3\n(N k texture). For large w, the agreement is good, although our results slightly overestimate those from the\nfull minimization. On the other hand, for small w the\ncurves obtained from the full minimisation converge towards our prediction as L increases. So, our approximation is accurate even for moderate values of L, despite\nthe assumptions involved in our approach. Consequently,\nthe scheme considered in this paper is an alternative to\nthe full minimization technique, which is quite expensive\nfrom a computational point of view, when wL > 1.\nFinally, it is interesting to note that the elastic contribution to the surface free-energy density, Eq. (27), can\nbe expressed as follows:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nI1 I2 \u03b3(\u03b1)\n\u03bbfelastic = 2 \u00d7 2\u03c0K\n+ BII (w, \u03b1) (29)\nln\n2 2\nL\nwhere we note that K(\u03b1) = \u22124\u03c0K(I1 /2)(I2 /2), with I1\nand I2 being the topological charges associated to the\ndisclination lines at the wedges and apexes, respectively.\n\n\f7\nThe characteristic length \u03b3(\u03b1), which absorbs the contribution to B from region I, is defined as:\n\u0015 \u0014\n\u0015\u0012 \u03c0\n\u0013 12 \u2212 \u03b1\u03c0\n1 \u03b1\n3 \u03b1\n2 +\u03b1\n\u0393\n\u2212\n+\n\u03b3(\u03b1) = \u0393\n\u03c0\n2 \u03c0\n2 \u03c0\n2 \u2212\u03b1\n\u0014\n\n(30)\n\nThis lengthscale decays continuously from \u03c0/2 for \u03b1 \u2192 0\nto 1 for \u03b1 \u2192 \u03c0/2. We can understand the first contribution in Eq. (29) as the interaction between the disclination line at x = 0 with half its topological charge and the\napexes at x = \u00b1L cos \u03b1, again with half their topological charges [36]. As the absolute values of the topological\ncharges are always smaller or equal than 1, the nucleation\nof disclinations at the cusps of the surface is favourable\nwith respect to bulk disclinations (which only may have\nhalf-integer values). With this intepretation, \u03b3(\u03b1) can be\nused to define an effective core radius \u03b3(\u03b1), and the sum\nof the core energies is given by BII (\u03b1, w).\n\nVI.\n\nsupport from MICINN (Spain) through Grant FIS200909326, and Junta de Andaluc\u0131\u0301a (Spain) through Grant\nNo. P09-FQM-4938, both co-funded by EU FEDER.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have analyzed elastic contribution to\nthe surface free-energy density for a nematic in contact\nto sawtoothed substrates in the strong anchoring regime,\ni.e. wL > 1. We have extended the analysis done in Ref.\n[26]. So, in addition to the leading contribution proportional to \u2212q ln q, with q being the substrate periodicity\nwavenumber q, we have characterized the next-to-leading\nterm. This term has two contributions: one associated to\nthe deviation of the orientational field with respect to the\ncontribution of the array of disclination lines nucleated\nat the cusps of the substrate, and the core free-energy\nassociated to them. We anticipate that our analysis can\nbe generalized for other substrate shapes when the nematic texture presents topological defects induced by the\nstructure, as, for example, in crenellated substrates [38].\nFurthermore, our results may be used to predict accurately the location of first-order wetting transitions in\nnematic liquid crystals in contact to general substrates\n[28, 29, 38]. However, we must note that our analysis is\nrestricted to bulk nematics liquid crystals with in-plane\ndeformations in presence of grooved substrates. The effect of the substrate structure in the nematic texture in\npartially filled configurations (i.e. with an isotropic fluid\nin bulk), the influence of twist nematic deformations [18]\nor the effect of the structure in the z direction deserve\nfurther study, but this is beyond the scope of this work.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors wish to thank Dr. P. Patr\u0131\u0301cio and Dr.\nN. M. Silvestre for very stimulating conversations and\ntechnical advice on the finite-element method, and Prof.\nM. M. Telo da Gama, Prof. L. F. Rull and Prof. A. O.\nParry for enlightening discussions. We acknowledge the\n\nAppendix A: Ansatz for the evaluation of fII\n\nIn order to estimate the free energy associated to the\nregion II, we can make use of an ansatz. As argued in the\npaper, the nematic order parameter S must vanish at the\ncusps of the substrate to avoid the divergence of the free\nenergy, but it must converge to the bulk value far from\nthe wedges and apexes. So, in the region around each\ncusp, we can suppose that S depends only on the radial\ndistance r from the wedge or apex. In particular,\nwe use\nr\nthe following ansatz [35]: S(r) = Sb (1 \u2212 e\u2212 \u03b2 ), where Sb\nis the bulk nematic order parameter and \u03b2 is a lengthscale to be determined later. We will assume that the\nbiaxiality parameter B = 0 everywhere. Regarding the\norientational field \u03b8, we assume that has the expression\ncorresponding to a disclination line placed at the origin:\n\u03b8 = \u03b1\u221e + I(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c0/2), where I is the winding number\nassociated to the disclination line, and \u03b1\u221e is the far-field\nvalue of the orientational field (0 for the N \u22a5 texture,\nand \u03c0/2 for the N k texture). Substituting this ansatz in\nthe LdG functional Eq. (1), this expression reduces to a\nfunction of \u03b2:\n(\nh\n13\n1\n2\n\u03bbf \u2248\n9I 2 (\u03c0 \u2213 2\u03b1) \u03b3\n(\u03c0 \u2213 2\u03b1)\u03b2 \u2212 2w(Rc \u2212 \u03b2) +\n144\n7\n\u0010 R \u0011i 11\n\u0010\n1 sin[(I \u2212 1)(\u03c0 \u2213 2\u03b1)]\nc\n+ ln\n+ (\u03c0 \u2213 2\u03b1) +\n2\u03b2\n16\n8\n(I \u2212 1)\n\u0002\n\u221318I sin(2\u03b1) \u2212 3 sin(\u22122I(\u03c0 \u2213 \u03b1) + (I \u2212 1)\u03c0)\n)\n\u0003\u0011\n(A1)\n\u2212 sin(\u22122I(\u00b1\u03b1) + (I \u2212 1)\u03c0)\nwhere we have considered the case \u03c4 = 1 and \u03ba = 2 (for\nother values, we can get straightforwardly analogous expressions). In this expression, the upper sign corresponds\nto the wedge situation (so I = I1 ), and the lower one to\nthe apex (so I = I2 ), and \u03b3 is the Euler constant. Minimizing Eq. (A1) with respect to \u03b2, we obtain the optimal\nvalue for this lengthscale:\ns\u0012\n\u00132\n72\nw\nw\n648 2\n72\n\u03b2=\u2212\n+\n+\nI (A2)\n13 (\u03c0 \u2213 2\u03b1)\n13 (\u03c0 \u2213 2\u03b1)\n91\nSubstituting Eq. (A2) into Eq. (A1), we get the free\nenergy estimate associated to each region around a cusp,\nand provides an upper limit to the real value of \u03bbf .\nIn order to have an estimate of BII , we substract to the\nobtained values of \u03bbf through this ansatz the surface and\nelastic contributions \u22122wRc and (K/2)I 2 (\u03c0\u22132\u03b1) ln Rc =\n(9/7)I 2 (\u03c0 \u2213 2\u03b1) ln Rc , respectively. After this, the estimate of BII is obtained as the sum of the results obtained\nfor the wedge and apex. Fig. 9 shows the comparison\n\n\f8\nof this estimates with the results obtained from the full\nminimization, for \u03b1 = \u03c0/6 (N \u22a5 texture) and \u03b1 = \u03c0/3\n(N k ) texture. They have the same order of magnitude,\n\nalthough our ansatz overestimate the value of BII , and\nqualitatively the dependence of BII with w is recovered.\n\n[1] B.-W. Lee and N. A.
