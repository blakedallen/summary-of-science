These algebras had\nbeen introduced in [5] as a generalization of the notion of a Lie algebra: a 3-Lie algebra is\ncharacterized by a totally antisymmetric trilinear product satisfying a Jacobi-type identity.\nIt was soon realized, however, that if one demands the positivity of the kinetic terms in\nthe action there remains an essentially unique such 3-algebra. Other notions of 3-algebras\nwere explored in [6] and [7] and, respectively, N = 6 and N = 2 actions based on them\nwere constructed. These 3-algebras were put into a Lie-theoretic framework in [8], where\nit was established that they are in one-to-one correspondence with pairs (g, V ) of a metric\nLie algebra g and its faithful unitary representation V . This analysis also showed that there\nare two kinds of relevant 3-algebras: real [7] and Hermitian [6], depending on whether the\nrepresentation V is real or complex.\nIf one is to describe effectively such BLG-like theories via the AdS/CFT correspondence,\none would seek a formulation allowing for arbitrary 'rank' N ; in particular, one would like\nto explore the N \u2192 \u221e limit. With this purpose in mind, we classify all 3-brackets on matrix\nalgebras (or, more generally, any \u2217-algebras) that give rise to metric real or Hermitian 3algebras. These brackets are constructed using only the matrix product and an involution.\nTheir structure is functorial, i.e. it is independent of the rank of the matrices. This also\nlists all possible candidates for a notion of a representation for 3-algebras. Recall that in the\ncase of Lie algebras, a representation is a homomorphism into a matrix algebra which takes\nthe Lie bracket into the commutator. For the case of 3-algebras, the matrix product is not\nenough to produce 3-brackets on matrix algebras which are general enough. However, we\nexpect that considering matrix algebras as \u2217-algebras may give enough freedom to represent\nany 3-algebra.\nBesides classifying the 3-brackets, we formulate a manifestly N = 4 supersymmetric\naction in projective superspace, which is based on these metric 3-algebras1 . We explore their\nrelation with the N = 2 actions found in [7] and with the original action of [2]. One of\nthe most interesting features of the BLG model is the subtle interplay between the gauge\nalgebra and supersymmetry, and we hope that our manifestly supersymmetric formulations\nshed more light on this issue.\nThis paper is organized as follows. We start with reviewing the BLG model and the\nalgebraic structure underlying this theory in Section 2. Section 3 contains the classification\n(3.9) and (3.18) of functorial metric 3-algebras structures on \u2217-algebras. Section 4 relates\nthe N = 2 actions based on real generalized 3-Lie algebras of [7] with the action of Section\n2. In Section 5, we formulate the N = 4 action in projective superspace for any 3-algebra,\nwhether real or Hermitian. The last section contains our conclusions.\n2.\n\nReview of the BLG theory\n\nIf not otherwise specified, we will use the conventions of [7] in the following.\n1\n\nFor the harmonic superspace formulation of the ABJM model [9] see [10]. This formulation makes N = 3\nsupersymmetries manifest.\n\n1\n\n\f2.1.\n\nAlgebraic structure\n\nLet A be a real finite-dimensional metric 3-Lie algebra. That is, A is a real vector space\nendowed with a totally antisymmetric 3-bracket [*, *, *] : A \u00d7 A \u00d7 A \u2192 A which satisfies the\nfundamental identity\n[A, B, [C, D, E]] = [[A, B, C], D, E] + [C, [A, B, D], E] + [C, D, [A, B, E]] ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nR\n\nand a positive definite bilinear symmetric map (*, *)A : A\u00d7A \u2192 satisfying the compatibility\ncondition\n([A, B, C], D)A + (C, [A, B, D])A = 0 ,\n(2.2)\nwhere A, B, C, D, E \u2208 A. Assuming that A is spanned by2 \u03c4 a , a, = 1, . . . , dim A, we can\nintroduce metric coefficients and structure constants according to\na b\nhab\nA = (\u03c4 , \u03c4 )A\n\na b c\nd\nabcd\nabc de\nand fA\n= fA\ne hA = ([\u03c4 , \u03c4 , \u03c4 ], \u03c4 )A ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nabcd is totally antisymmetric. Basically, the only nonrespectively. Note that the symbol fA\ntrivial example [11, 12, 13] is the metrized version of the 3-Lie algebra A = A4 in the\nabcd = \u03b5abcd ; it can be trivially extended to a\nclassification of [5], for which dim A = 4, fA\nab\nmetric 3-Lie algebra by putting hab\nA = \u03b4 . The only other possibilities are direct sums of A4 .\nThere is an associated Lie algebra g(A) obtained from A. This algebra is the linear span\nof all operators3 D\u03c4 a \u2227\u03c4 b defined by\n\nD\u03c4 a \u2227\u03c4 b (A) := [\u03c4 a , \u03c4 b , A] ,\n\nA\u2208A.\n\n(2.4)\n\nThus, the space A is a carrier space of a faithful representation of g(A) \u2286 o(A). The Lie\nalgebra g(A) has structure constants4\n[ab][cd]\n\nfg\n\n[ef ]\n\nc abd\nabc d\n:= (fA\ne \u03b4f + \u03b4e fA f )[ef ] .\n\n(2.5)\n\nHere, (*)[ef ] denotes antisymmetrization in the indices e, f . The induced Killing form on g(A)\nis given by\nX [ab][ef ]\n[ab][cd]\n[cd][gh]\n(D\u03c4 a \u2227\u03c4 b , D\u03c4 c \u2227\u03c4 d )g,ind \u223c\nfg\n[ef ] =: hg,ind ,\n[gh] fg\n[ef ],[gh]\n\nand direct computation5 shows that\n[ab][cd]\n\nhg,ind\n\nabe cdg\n= (dim A \u2212 2)fA\ng fA e .\n\n(2.6)\n\n[ab][cd]\n\nWhenever the Cartan criterion hg,ind \u223c \u03b4[ab][cd] is fulfilled (which is the case e.g. for the\n3-Lie algebra A4 ), g(A) is a semisimple Lie algebra.\n2\n\nContrary to common conventions, we follow [2] and associate upper indices with the generators of A.\n\n3\n\nWe define the wedge and the triple bracket as acting solely on the 3-algebra part. That is, for fields\nA, B, C taking values in A, we have A \u2227 B := Aa Bb \u03c4 a \u2227 \u03c4 b and [A, B, C] := Aa Bb Cc [\u03c4 a , \u03c4 b , \u03c4 c ].\n4\n\nIn the following, subscripts g refer to g(A) for short.\n\n5\n\nabc\nabcd A\nab\nNote that fA\nhcd = 0, where hA\nc = fA\nab is the inverse of hA .\n\n2\n\n\fFor the BLG theory, however, one has to work with another pairing (*, *)g with coefficients\n[ab][cd]\n\nabcd\n=: hg\n(D\u03c4 a \u2227\u03c4 b , D\u03c4 c \u2227\u03c4 d )g = fA\n\n.\n\n(2.7)\n\nThe latter choice is symmetric and satisfies in particular ([X, Y ], Z)g + (Y, [X, Z])g = 0 for\nall X, Y, Z \u2208 g(A) and is, therefore, an invariant pairing. It is also non-degenerate, as the\n[ab][cd]\noriginal pairing on A is. It has been proved in [8] that hg\nalways has split signature and\ntherefore necessarily differs from the Killing form. It follows that g(A) is not a simple Lie\nalgebra.\n2.2.\n\nAction, equations of motions, and supersymmetry transformations\n\nThe matter sector of the theory is given by 8 scalars X I , I = 1, . . . , 8 together with a\nMajorana spinor \u03a8 of SO(1, 10), both taking values in the 3-Lie algebra A. Additionally, we\nintroduce a gauge potential A\u03bc , which takes values in the associated Lie algebra g(A) and\nyields the covariant derivative\n\u2207\u03bc X = \u2202\u03bc X \u2212 A\u03bc X .\n\n(2.8)\n\nInfinitesimal gauge transformations generated by \u039b \u2208 g(A) act according to\n\u03b4X = \u039bX ,\n\n\u03b4\u03a8 = \u039b\u03a8 ,\n\n\u03b4A\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc \u039b \u2212 [A\u03bc , \u039b] .\n\n(2.9)\n\nLet \u0393\u0302M , M = 0, . . . , 10, be the 32 \u00d7 32-dimensional \u03b3-matrices generating the Clifford algebra C := Cl( 1,10 ) and \u0393 := \u0393\u03020 . . . .\u0393\u030210 be the corresponding chirality operator; introduce\nfurthermore the subset \u0393I = \u0393\u0302I+2 , I = 1, ..., 8. We find it convenient to combine the scalars\ninto X := \u0393I X I , and to extend the definition of the triple bracket linearly:\n\nR\n\n[X, X, A] := \u0393IJ [X I , X J , A]\n\nand\n\n[X, X, X] := \u0393IJK [X I , X J , X K ] ,\n\n(2.10)\n\nwhere A \u2208 A and \u0393I...J = \u0393[I . . . \u0393J] . Moreover, we extend the trace over A to a trace over\nA \u2297 C by\n\u0001\n1\ntr C (A, B)A ,\n(2.11)\n(A, B)A\u2297C := 32\n\nwhere tr C (*) denotes the trace over the \u03b3-matrices. With these definitions, we can write the\nLagrangian of the BLG model [2] as\nLBLG = \u2212 21 (\u2207\u03bc X, \u2207\u03bc X)A\u2297C + 2i (\u03a8\u0304, \u0393\u03bc \u2207\u03bc \u03a8)A + 4i (\u03a8\u0304, [X, X, \u03a8])A\n\u2212\n\n1\n12 ([X, X, X], [X, X, X])A\u2297C\n\n\u0001 (2.12)\n+ 12 \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03ba (A\u03bc , \u2202\u03bd A\u03ba )g + 13 (A\u03bc , [A\u03bd , A\u03ba ])g .\n\nThe associated action is invariant (up to a total derivative) under the gauge transformations\n(2.9). It is furthermore invariant under N = 8 supersymmetries up to the equations of\nmotion\n\u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bc X + 2i \u0393K [\u03a8\u0304, X, \u0393K \u03a8] + 21 \u0393[X, X, \u0393[X, X, X]] = 0 ,\n\u0393\u03bc \u2207\u03bc \u03a8 + 12 [X, X, \u03a8] = 0 ,\n\n(2.13)\n\n[\u2207\u03bc , \u2207\u03bd ] + \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03ba ( tr C (X \u2227 (\u2207\u03ba X)) + 2i \u03a8\u0304 \u2227 (\u0393\u03ba \u03a8)) = 0 .\n\nExplicitly, the supersymmetry transformations are given by\n\u03b4X = i\u0393I \u03b5\u0304\u0393I \u03a8 ,\n\n\u03b4\u03a8 = \u2207\u03bc X\u0393\u03bc \u03b5 \u2212 61 [X, X, X]\u03b5 ,\n3\n\n\u03b4A\u03bc = i\u03b5\u0304\u0393\u03bc (X \u2227 \u03a8) .\n\n(2.14)\n\n\f3.\n\nGeneralizations and the classification of 3-algebras\n\nIn [8], it was observed that 3-Lie algebras and two generalizations introduced in [6] and [7]\ncan be constructed by a procedure originally introduced by Faulkner [14]. Namely, one starts\nwith a pair (g, V ) consisting of a metric Lie algebra g and its faithful unitary representation\nV . From this data, one produces a 3-algebra structure. In fact, there is equivalence of\n3-algebras with such pairs up to isomorphisms. The analysis of [8] yielded three such types6 :\n(1) The real case, obtained from a Lie algebra g together with a faithful real orthogonal\nrepresentation of g. This yields the generalized 3-Lie algebras of [7].\n(2) The Hermitian case, which corresponds to a pair of a Lie algebra and a faithful complex\nunitary representation. This corresponds to the complex 3-Lie algebras of [6].\n(3) The quaternionic case, in which the representation is quaternionic unitary. This case\ncan be considered as a specialization of the Hermitian case.\nIn this section we present a classification for functorial generalized 3-Lie structures on\n\u2217-algebras. Let us be precise about the problem we are solving.\nRecall that a \u2217-algebra (over complex numbers) is an associative algebra R with antilinear\ninvolutive antiautomorphism, that is a map \u2217 : R \u2192 R, A 7\u2192 A\u2217 satisfying for all A, B \u2208 R\nand \u03b1 \u2208 C\n(\u03b1A)\u2217 = \u03b1 A\u2217 ,\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n(A\u2217 )\u2217 = A ,\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n(A + B) = A + B ,\n\n(3.1)\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n(AB) = B A .\n\n(3.2)\n\nWe consider algebras equipped with the trace form tr : R \u2192 C that satisfies\ntr (A\u2217 ) = tr (A) ,\n\ntr (AB) = tr (BA) ,\n\u2217\n\n0 \u2264 tr (AA ) \u2208 R .\n\n(3.3)\n(3.4)\n\nIn the case of real \u2217-algebras, the definition is the same, but the coefficients \u03b1 above are real.\nThe brackets classified below are all functorial brackets, that is brackets that can be\ndefined in terms of the basic operations: the product and the involution. Note that since\nthe bracket has to be multilinear, it should be equal to a combination of cubic monomials.\nEven though for matrices of small size there may exist brackets outside our classification,\nthis classification is exhaustive for matrices of generic size since these do not satisfy any\n\u2217-algebra identities. More formally, one can say7 that we are looking for homomorphisms\nfrom the operad of generalized 3-Lie algebras to the operad of \u2217-algebras. In the case of a\nmatrix algebra R = Matn with some canonical 3-bracket on it, we are essentially discussing\nwhat are n-dimensional representations for arbitrary 3-algebras, where the representation\nhomomorphism takes the 3-algebra bracket into the canonical one.\n6\n\nSome specific 3-algebras appear in [15] and [16]. These are based on a matrix algebra with a 4-bracket\n1 ijkl\n[[A1 , A2 , A3 , A4 ]] := 4!\n\u03b5 Ai Aj Ak Al with a 3-algebra structure defined by [A, B, C] = [A, B, C, T ] with an\nappropriately chosen matrix T . This 3-bracket does not necessarily satisfy the fundamental identity. However,\nin [15] it is observed that its factor algebra is a 3-Lie algebra, which is either A4 or Lorentzian. In [16], on the\nother hand, only part of the associated Lie algebra is gauged and as a result, only some of the fundamental\nidentity relations have to be enforced.\n7\nIf one only cares about the fundamental identity; trace relations specific for matrices of given size make\neverything a bit more subtle.\n\n4\n\n\f3.1.\n\nThe real case\n\nGeneralized 3-Lie algebras were introduced in [7] and were used to obtain a BLG-type model\nwith N = 2 supersymmetries. Given a generalized 3-Lie algebra, we have a trilinear triple\nproduct [*, *, *] : A \u00d7 A \u00d7 A \u2192 A and a Euclidean form (*, *)A : A \u00d7 A \u2192 on a real vector\nspace A, which satisfy the following compatibility conditions for all A, B, C, D, E \u2208 A:\n\nR\n\n(1) The 3-product is antisymmetric in its first two slots:\n[A, B, C] = \u2212[B, A, C] .\n\n(3.5)\n\n(2) The 3-product satisfies the fundamental identity:\n[A, B, [C, D, E]] = [[A, B, C], D, E] + [C, [A, B, D], E] + [C, D, [A, B, E]] .\n\n(3.6)\n\n(3) The pairing (*, *)A is an invariant form under derivations of A given by the 3-product:\n([A, B, C], D) + (C, [A, B, D]) = 0 ,\n\n(3.7)\n\nand satisfies the further symmetry relation\n([A, B, C], D) + ([C, D, A], B) = 0 .\n\n(3.8)\n\nExactly in the same fashion as for 3-Lie algebras, which were discussed in Section 2.1, we\ncan define a Lie algebra g(A) \u2286 o(A) associated to the generalized 3-Lie algebra A, cf. [7].\nMoreover, it was proved in [8] that there is a one-to-one correspondence, up to isomorphisms,\nbetween generalized 3-Lie algebras and pairs (g, V ), where g is a metric real Lie algebra and\nV is a faithful orthogonal g-module.\n3.2.\n\nClassification of real metric 3-algebras\n\nWe begin by identifying all brackets that only satisfy the fundamental identity. Let us use\nthe following notation:\n[A, B] = AB \u2212 BA ,\n\n{A, B} = AB + BA ,\n\n[A, B]C = ACB \u2212 BCA .\n\nThe following classification is a result of a straightforward computation. For a generic\ncombination of cubic monomials, we wrote down the fundamental identity, extracted the\ncoefficients of all appearing monomials of degree 5, and, using the computer algebra system\nMuPAD, we solved the corresponding system of equations. The set of solutions of that system\nprovides the following list of ternary brackets that arise canonically from real \u2217-algebras and\nsatisfy the fundamental identity:\nI\u03b1 :\nA, B, C 7\u2192 \u03b1({[A, B], C \u2217 } + [{A\u2217 , B}, C] \u2212 [{A, B \u2217 }, C] \u2212 {[A\u2217 , B \u2217 ], C \u2217 }) ;\nII\u03b1,\u03b2 :\nA, B, C 7\u2192 \u03b1[[A, B], C] + \u03b2([[A\u2217 , B], C] + [[A, B \u2217 ], C] + [[A, B], C \u2217 ] \u2212 [[A\u2217 , B \u2217 ], C \u2217 ]) ;\n5\n\n\fIII\u03b1,\u03b2 :\nA, B, C 7\u2192 \u03b1([[A, B], C] + [[A\u2217 , B \u2217 ], C] + [[A\u2217 , B], C \u2217 ] + [[A, B \u2217 ], C \u2217 ])\n\n+ \u03b2([[A, B], C \u2217 ] + [[A\u2217 , B], C] + [[A, B \u2217 ], C] + [[A\u2217 , B \u2217 ], C \u2217 ]) ;\n\nIV\u03b1,\u03b2 :\nA, B, C 7\u2192 \u03b1({[A\u2217 , B \u2217 ], C \u2217 } + {[A\u2217 , B \u2217 ], C} + {[A, B \u2217 ], C \u2217 } + {[A\u2217 , B], C \u2217 }\n+ {[A\u2217 , B], C} + {[A, B \u2217 ], C} + {[A, B], C \u2217 } + {[A, B], C})\n+ \u03b2([A, C]B + [A, C \u2217 ]B + [A, C]B \u2217 + [A\u2217 , C]B + [A, C \u2217 ]B \u2217\n\n+ [A\u2217 , C \u2217 ]B + [A\u2217 , C]B \u2217 + [A\u2217 , C \u2217 ]B \u2217 ) ;\nV\u03b1,\u03b2 :\nA, B, C 7\u2192 \u03b1({[A\u2217 , B \u2217 ], C \u2217 } \u2212 {[A\u2217 , B \u2217 ], C} \u2212 {[A, B \u2217 ], C \u2217 } \u2212 {[A\u2217 , B], C \u2217 }\n+ {[A\u2217 , B], C} + {[A, B \u2217 ], C} + {[A, B], C \u2217 } \u2212 {[A, B], C})\n+ \u03b2(\u2212[A, C]B + [A, C \u2217 ]B + [A, C]B \u2217 + [A\u2217 , C]B\n\n\u2212 [A, C \u2217 ]B \u2217 \u2212 [A\u2217 , C \u2217 ]B \u2212 [A\u2217 , C]B \u2217 + [A\u2217 , C \u2217 ]B \u2217 ) ;\nVI\u03b1,\u03b2 :\nA, B, C 7\u2192 \u03b12 ({[A\u2217 , B \u2217 ], C \u2217 } + [{A\u2217 , B}, C] \u2212 [{A, B \u2217 }, C] + {[A, B], C \u2217 })\n\n+ \u03b1\u03b2([AB \u2217 \u2212 BA\u2217 , C \u2217 ] + (AB + A\u2217 B \u2217 )C) + \u03b2 2 (AB \u2217 \u2212 BA\u2217 )C ;\n\nVII\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3 :\nA, B, C 7\u2192 \u03b13 (\u2212[[A, B], C] \u2212 [[A\u2217 , B \u2217 ], C] + {{A\u2217 , B}, C} \u2212 {{A, B \u2217 }, C})\n+ \u03b2\u03b3 2 ((AB \u2217 \u2212 BA\u2217 )C)\n\n+ \u03b12 \u03b2({[A, B], C \u2217 } + {[A\u2217 , B \u2217 ], C \u2217 } + [{A\u2217 , B}, C] \u2212 [{A, B \u2217 }, C])\n+ \u03b12 \u03b3((BA\u2217 \u2212 AB \u2217 )C + C(A\u2217 B \u2212 B \u2217 A))\n\n+ \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3([A, B]C + [A\u2217 , B \u2217 ]C + {AB \u2217 \u2212 BA\u2217 , C \u2217 }) ;\n\nVIII\u03b1,\u03b2 :\nA, B, C 7\u2192 \u03b1(AB \u2217 \u2212 BA\u2217 )C + \u03b2C(A\u2217 B \u2212 B \u2217 A) ;\nIX\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3 :\nA, B, C 7\u2192 \u03b1([[A, B], C] + [[A\u2217 , B \u2217 ], C]) + \u03b2[AB \u2217 \u2212 BA\u2217 , C] + \u03b3[A\u2217 B \u2212 B \u2217 A, C] .\nHere, the Greek letters \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 denote arbitrary real parameters.\nUsing this result, it is not too hard to obtain the list of canonical 3-brackets satisfying all\nconditions with the inner product (A, B) = tr (AB \u2217 ). Here we use the fact that all identities\ninvolving traces follow from the fundamental properties of traces (3.3). Among the brackets\nlisted above, all satisfy the fundamental identity (3.6), but not all are compatible with the\ninner product. Imposing these compatibility conditions (3.7) and (3.8), we end up with the\nfollowing list of canonical generalized 3-Lie algebras arising from real \u2217-algebras:\n6\n\n\fI\u03b1 :\nA, B, C 7\u2192 \u03b1([[A\u2217 , B], C] + [[A, B \u2217 ], C] + [[A, B], C \u2217 ] \u2212 [[A\u2217 , B \u2217 ], C \u2217 ]) ;\nII\u03b1 :\nA, B, C 7\u2192 \u03b1([[A, B \u2217 ], C] + [[A\u2217 , B], C]) ;\n\n(3.9)\n\nIII\u03b1,\u03b2 :\nA, B, C 7\u2192 \u03b1(AB \u2217 \u2212 BA\u2217 )C + \u03b2C(A\u2217 B \u2212 B \u2217 A) ;\nIV\u03b1,\u03b2 :\nA, B, C 7\u2192 \u03b1([[A, B], C] + [[A\u2217 , B \u2217 ], C] + [[A\u2217 , B], C \u2217 ] + [[A, B \u2217 ], C \u2217 ])\n\n+ \u03b2([[A, B], C \u2217 ] + [[A\u2217 , B], C] + [[A, B \u2217 ], C] + [[A\u2217 , B \u2217 ], C \u2217 ]) .\n\nAs above, \u03b1, \u03b2 denote again arbitrary real parameters.\nAt the moment we do not know a complete answer to the question of how these brackets\ncan be represented by each other (in particular, it might be the case that they all can be\nrepresented by one of them). Let us give one nontrivial example of such a representation\nhere: The matrix algebra Matn with the bracket of type IV0,1 is isomorphic to a 3-subalgebra\nof the matrix algebra !\nMat2n with the bracket of type III1,\u22121; the embedding is given by the\n\u2217\na a\n.\nformula a 7\u2192\na\u2217 a\n3.3.\n\nThe Hermitian case\n\nThis generalization of a 3-Lie algebra was introduced in [6] to obtain a BLG-type model\npreserving N = 6 supersymmetries. A metric Hermitian 3-Lie algebra A is given by a 3product [*, * ; *] : A \u00d7 A \u00d7 A \u2192 A, which is linear in its first two slots and antilinear in the\nthird one, and a Hermitian form (*, *) : A \u00d7 A \u2192 , which satisfy the following constraints\nfor all A, B, C, D, E \u2208 A:\n\nC\n\n(1) Antisymmetry in the first two slots:\n[A, B; C] = \u2212[B, A; C] .\n\n(3.10)\n\n([A, B; C], D) = (B, [C, D; A]) .\n\n(3.11)\n\n(2) Metric compatibility:\n\n(3) The Hermitian fundamental identity:\n[[C, D; E], A; B] \u2212 [[C, A; B], D; E] \u2212 [C, [D, A; B]; E] + [C, D; [E, B; A]] = 0 . (3.12)\nWe assume again that A as a vector space is spanned by \u03c4 a , a = 1, . . . , dim(A). Then we\nfind an associated Lie algebra gC (A) which is generated by the following action on elements\nof A:\n(3.13)\nD\u03c4 a \u2297\u03c4 b (A) := [A, \u03c4 a ; \u03c4 b ] , A \u2208 A .\n7\n\n\fTo obtain the associated real Lie algebra g(A) \u2286 o(A), one has to antisymmetrize this action,\ncf. [8]:\nD\u03c4 a \u2227\u03c4 b (A) := [A, \u03c4 a ; \u03c4 b ] \u2212 [A, \u03c4 b ; \u03c4 a ] , A \u2208 A .\n(3.14)\nThe Hermitian fundamental identity (3.12) ensures [8] that the commutator of two such\nactions is again an element in g(A). An invariant form on g(A) can be defined as the linear\nextension of\n(3.15)\n(D\u03c4 a \u2227\u03c4 b , D\u03c4 c \u2227\u03c4 d )g := Re([\u03c4 c , \u03c4 a ; \u03c4 b ], \u03c4 d )A .\nFrom the above constraints (1) and (2), we obtain ([A, B; C], D) = \u2212([A, B; D], C) and as\n(*, *)A is Hermitian, (*, *)g is also Hermitian and satisfies\n(X, Y )g = (Y, X)\u2217g\n\n(3.16)\n\nfor all X, Y \u2208 g(A). Invariance of this Hermitian form follows in a straightforward manner\nfrom the axioms given above and for all X, Y, Z \u2208 g(A), we have\n([X, Y ], Z)g + (Y, [X, Z])g = 0 .\n3.4.\n\n(3.17)\n\nClassification of Hermitian metric 3-algebras\n\nThe linearity/antilinearity condition is very restrictive. Instead of 48 cubic monomials that\noccur in a generic combination, we have only 6. This results in just one series of examples.\nNamely, it is easy to see that the only series of Hermitian metric 3-Lie algebras arising from\ncomplex \u2217-algebras is\nA, B, C 7\u2192 \u03b1(AC \u2217 B \u2212 BC \u2217 A) ,\n(3.18)\nwhere \u03b1 \u2208 R.\nIt is interesting to note that this only bracket has been already discovered in [6]; there this\nbracket on matrix algebras was used to give a 3-algebraic formulation of the ABJM model.\n4.\n\nN = 2 superfield formulation\n\nIt is evident that the BLG theory has to allow for a description in terms of N = 2 superfields\nin three dimensions that is analogous to Chern-Simons matter theories [17, 18], see also\n[19]. All N = 2 superfield actions found in [7] however differ from the BLG theory in the\ninteraction terms. As we will show in this section, one can add a superpotential term to this\naction such that it exactly reproduces the BLG theory. Note that we give here a general\nsuperfield action, which can be combined with any of the 3-algebra structures discussed\nabove, whether real or Hermitian. In the following, we adopt the conventions of [20] and [7].\n4.1.\n\nThe superfield action\n\nLet A be an arbitrary 3-algebra and g(A) its associated Lie algebra. Consider four A-valued\nchiral superfields \u03a6i , i = 1, . . . , 4 together with a g(A)-valued vector superfield V defined on\n\n8\n\n\fR\n\nthe superspace 1,2|4 . We will use the following superfield expansions, which are obtained\nby dimensionally reducing the superfield expansions of [20] from 1,3|4 to 1,2|4 :\n\u221a\n\u03a6i (y) = \u03c6i (y) + 2\u03b8\u03c8 i (y) + \u03b8 2 F i (y) ,\n(4.1)\nV (x) = \u2212\u03b8 \u03b1 \u03b8\u0304 \u03b1\u0307 (\u03c3\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1\u0307 A\u03bc (x) + i\u03b5\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 \u03c3(x)) + i\u03b8 2 (\u03b8\u0304\u03bb\u0304(x)) \u2212 i\u03b8\u0304 2 (\u03b8\u03bb(x)) + 12 \u03b8 2 \u03b8\u0304 2 D(x) ,\n\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nR1,2|2 R\n\nwhere x \u2208 1,2 and y is the usual coordinate on the chiral subspace ch \u2282 1,2|4 . BLGtype actions with at least N = 2 supersymmetry are obtained from the following base action\n[7]:\nZ\nZ\n\u0001\n3\nS0 =\nd x d4 \u03b8 \u03ba i(V, (D\u0304\u03b1 D \u03b1 V ))g + 32 (V, {(D\u0304 \u03b1 V ), (D\u03b1 V )})g + (\u03a6\u0304i , e2iV \u03a6i )A . (4.2)\n\nNote that the anticommutator {*, *} reduces in components to the commutator in g(A) and\nis therefore well defined. This action possesses manifest N = 2 supersymmetry as well as\nan SU(4) flavor symmetry. The interaction terms, however, do not possess the SO(8) flavor\nsymmetry, and therefore the action (4.2) is necessarily different from the BLG model. One\ncan supersymmetrically extend S0 by adding superpotential terms of the form\nZ\nZ\nS1 =\nd3 x d2 \u03b8W(\u03a61 , . . . , \u03a64 ) + c.c. ,\n(4.3)\nwhere W is a (holomorphic) polynomial in the chiral matter superfields \u03a6i . Classical conformal invariance requires W to be homogeneous of degree 4. Furthermore, the desired flavor\nsymmetry as well as the R-symmetry for N > 2 restricts the form of the polynomial. For\nexample, for flavor symmetry SU(4) and A a 3-Lie algebra, the only possible polynomial is\nW(\u03a61 , . . . , \u03a64 ) = tijkl ([\u03a6i , \u03a6j , \u03a6k ], \u03a6l )A ,\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhere tijkl has to be an SU(4) invariant tensors and is therefore proportional to \u03b5ijkl . One\ncan also consider an additional Yang-Mills term; however, such a term does break classical\nconformal invariance.\n4.2.\n\nThe BLG model in N = 2 language: The 3-Lie algebra case\n\nNot surprisingly, and similarly to the description of d = 4, N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory\nin terms of N = 1 superfields, one can couple the superpotential (4.4) to the base action S0\nand for a specific value of the coupling, one obtains the BLG model. For this, we have to\ndemand that A is a 3-Lie algebra.

Moreover, to reproduce the interaction terms of the\nN = 6 model of [6] by using N = 2 superfields, one has to choose an U(1) \u223c\n= SO(2) action\nwithin the SU(4) R-symmetry, which becomes the R-symmetry of the N = 2 superfields.\nThis choice determines the supersymmetries which will be realized linearly, and also requires\nthe introduction of new superfields \u039ei , which are defined as linear combinations of the original\nchiral superfields \u03a6i . As the principle is clear, we refrain from going into further detail and\nturn our attention towards higher manifest supersymmetry.\n5.\n\nN = 4 superfield formulation\n\nIn this section, we will formulate a BLG-like action with manifest N = 4 supersymmetry.\nThere are two superspace approaches to theories with higher supersymmetries: harmonic\nsuperspace, which has recently been used in [10] for studying the ABJM model, and projective\nsuperspace [21, 22, 23, 24], which we employ here. For a detailed discussion of superconformal\nfield theories in projective superspace, see [25].\nNote that a number of N = 4 supersymmetric Chern-Simons matter theories have been\nconstructed in the context of certain Janus configurations of d = 4, N = 4 super YangMills theory [26] by Gaiotto and Witten (GW). The GW models have matter fields in a\ndifferent representation of the gauge group compared to our situation and in particular,\nthese theories do not contain the BLG model; in [27], however, they have been extended\nby twisted hypermultiplets to reproduce the BLG model. Other extensions reproduce the\nABJM model and variants thereof [28].\n5.1.\n\nThree-dimensional projective superspace\n\nThe N = 2 superfield description of the BLG model was obtained from a dimensional reduction of four-dimensional N = 1 superspace to three dimensions, and we expect the same to\nhold true for the N = 4 description in terms of projective superspace.

Such a multiplet\ncorresponds to a hypermultiplet in four dimensions and contains the degrees of freedom of\ntwo chiral multiplets in N = 2 superspace language. Its expansion reads as9\n\u03b7 = \u03a6\u0304\n\n1\n1\n+ \u03a3\u0304 + X \u2212 \u03b6\u03a3 + \u03b6 2 \u03a6 ,\n2\n\u03b6\n\u03b6\n\n(5.5)\n\nwhere X = X\u0304. The real structure acts by conjugation and by sending \u03b6 7\u2192 \u2212(\u03b6\u0304)\u22121 . From\n \u0304 \u03bb,\nthe condition that these fields are supported on and thus are annihilated by \u2207\u03bb and \u2207\n2\none concludes that \u03a6 is a chiral superfield, \u03a3 is a complex linear superfield D\u0304 \u03a3 = 0 and X\nis a real unconstrained superfield, which will turn out to be purely auxiliary. The complex\nlinear superfield appears as the dual of another chiral superfield in the action.\nFor the gauge field, we use a tropical multiplet V, which is defined around the equator of\nthe auxiliary P 1 :\n\u221e\nX\nvn \u03b6 n\n(5.6)\nV(\u03b6, \u03b6\u0304) =\n\nS\n\nC\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\n(\u22121)n v\u0304\n\nwith components v\u2212n =\nn . There are various gauge choices one can impose, cf. e.g.\n[23]. First of all, we can gauge away all degrees v\u00b1n with n \u2265 2, which makes the tropical\nmultiplet look similar to that of a shifted, real O(2) multiplet. We furthermore switch to a\n9\n\nStrictly speaking, the expression in (5.5) is for the ratio of a proper O(4) multiplet and a chosen section\nof O(4) given by \u03b6 2 . Thus, the degrees of \u03b6 in our convention for O(2p)-multiplets are shifted compared to\nthose used in [23].\n\n12\n\n\fLindstr\u00f6m-Ro\u010dek gauge, in which only the (anti-)chiral piece of v\u22121 (v1 ) survives. In this\ngauge, v0 is a real superfield, playing the role of the N = 2 vector superfield V , and v\u00b11 are\nits superpartners, i.e. v1 is a chiral superfield and v\u22121 its complex conjugate.\nAs before, we assume that the two O(4) multiplets \u03b71,2 take values in a 3-algebra A (or\nits complexification if A is real), while the tropical multiplet takes values in the associated\nLie algebra g(A).\n5.3.\n\nThe superfield action\n\nThe field content and the form of (4.2) lead us to an N = 4 action:\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\nS =\n\u03bc \u03ba i(V, (D\u0304\u03b1 D \u03b1 V))g + 32 (V, {(D\u0304 \u03b1 V), (D\u03b1 V)})g + \u03b7\u0304k , e2iV \u03b7k A ,\n\n(5.7)\n\n(v\u22121 , {D \u03b1 v0 , D\u0304\u03b1 v1 })g + (v0 , {D \u03b1 v\u22121 , D\u0304\u03b1 v1 })g + (v1 , {D \u03b1 v\u22121 , D\u0304\u03b1 v0 })g .\n\n(5.8)\n\nwhere, as above, D\u03b1 = D1\u03b1 . Let us decompose this action into N = 2 superfields to\ndemonstrate its relation with (4.2). First, we examine the Chern-Simons part. In this\npart, the chiral derivatives D and D\u0304 together with the total antisymmetry of the cubic term\nin V annihilate the chiral superfield in the tropical multiplet, which leaves us with terms\ncontaining nothing but the N = 2 vector superfield v0 . To see this, recall that in three\n\u03bc\ndimensions {D\u03b1 , D\u0304 \u03b1 } = \u03b5\u03b1\u03b2 {D\u03b1 , D\u0304\u03b2 } = \u22122i\u03b5\u03b1\u03b2 \u03c3\u03b1\u03b2\n\u2202\u03bc = 0, as the \u03c3-matrices can be chosen\n\u03b1\nto be symmetric. Thus the first term (V, (D\u0304\u03b1 D V))g reduces in Lindstr\u00f6m-Ro\u010dek gauge\nto (v0 , (D\u0304\u03b1 D \u03b1 v0 ))g under the integral. The terms which remain of 32 (V, {(D\u0304 \u03b1 V), (D\u03b1 V)})g,\nafter the contour integration in Lindstr\u00f6m-Ro\u010dek gauge is performed, and which contain\nfields besides v0 are\n\nUsing partial integration as well as cyclicity of (*, *)g, one can rewrite this expression so that\nit is proportional to {D \u03b1 , D\u0304\u03b1 }, which is identically zero. Thus, the N = 4 Chern-Simons\npart reduces to the N = 2 Chern-Simons part.\nThe part containing the hypermultiplets requires a lengthier analysis; we can essentially\nfollow the discussions of [23, 29, 30].

Supersymmetry requires integration over the full measure \u03bc. Demanding classical conformal invariance as well as no\nhigher derivatives reduces the choices of the matter-field action to Sm . As the actual BLG\nmodel has to be included in the set of N = 4 BLG-type models, we conclude that (5.7) is in\nfact the BLG model, if A is a 3-Lie algebra. In other cases, the interaction terms will differ\nand N = 4 or N = 6 supersymmetry will be realized.\n6.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have presented a complete classification of functorial representations on \u2217-algebras of the\ngeneralized metric 3-algebra structures exposed in [8]. We found the four families (3.9) of\nsuch representations in the real case, while the Hermitian case allowed only for the single one\n(3.18). These altogether five classes of 3-brackets give a wealth of explicitly realized matrix\n3-algebras of arbitrary rank. What is more important, these brackets may be reasonable\n14\n\n\fcandidates for 3-algebraic structures on matrices which are rich enough to represent any\ngeneralized metric 3-algebra. We hope to address this issue in more detail elsewhere.\nWe have also given manifestly N = 2 and N = 4 invariant formulations of BLG-type\nmodels based on these real and Hermitian 3-algebras. For the former, we used the dimensional\nreduction of ordinary N = 1 superspace from four to three dimensions, while for the latter, we\nemployed the dimensional reduction of N = 2 projective superspace. The N = 4 formulation\nof Chern-Simons matter theories is completely new, and might find further applications\nbesides the description of multiple M2-branes. Both the N = 2 and the N = 4 formulations\ncan be endowed with any of the generalized metric 3-algebra structures in our classification.\nIn general, however, such actions have less than the N = 8 supersymmetry of the original\nBLG theory that is based on the 3-Lie algebra A4 . Note that similarly, manifestly N = 4\nsupersymmetric formulations of the ABJM and the GW models can also be given.\nOne might consider the absence of any explicit 3-product in the N = 4 formulation as\nevidence that the more general 3-algebras appearing are not fundamental, but merely appear\nin a rewriting of the theory. This would suggest that this 3-algebra rewriting does not provide\nany deeper insight than its equivalent gauge theory formulation. One can contemplate,\nhowever, that the presence of the underlying 3-algebra structure does indicate some hidden\nsymmetries and conserved currents. We hope that our actions and 3-algebra classification can\nshed some light on this issue. Also, the fact that 3-Lie algebras neatly fit into the framework\nof strong homotopy Lie algebras [31] hints at a more subtle role of the 3-algebras. While\n3-Lie algebras satisfy the homotopy Jacobi identities of strong homotopy Lie algebras, the\ngeneralized 3-Lie algebras satisfy the strong homotopy pre-Lie algebra identities. All this\nsuggests that generalized 3-Lie algebras may provide some new insight into the properties of\nthe theories that we have presented here.\nAcknowledgements\nSCh is grateful to Martin Ro\u010dek and Ulf Lindstr\u00f6m for useful conversations.

This will also affect the matter superfields, and we collect all the relevant formulas\nhere for reference. We assume that the chiral superfield is in the fundamental representation.\nAlso, contrary to the conventions of [20], we assume anti-Hermitian generators, so that\nF\u03bc\u03bd := \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc + [A\u03bc , A\u03bd ] ,\n\n\u2207\u03bc \u03a6 = \u2202\u03bc \u03a6 + A\u03bc \u03a6 ,\n15\n\n\u2207\u03bc \u03a6\u0304 = \u2202\u03bc \u03a6\u0304 \u2212 \u03a6\u0304A\u03bc .
