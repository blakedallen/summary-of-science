Introduction\nMicroquasars are X-ray binary systems with collimated relativistic jets produced by the accretion of matter from a normal star to a compact object such as a neutron star or a black\nhole (Mirabel & Rodr\u0131\u0301guez 1999; Fender 2004). This highly\nenergetic process has observable consequences from radio to\nhard X-rays and possibly up to \u03b3-ray energies (Paredes et al.\n2000). An interesting property of microquasars is that, contrary to what happens in quasars, they offer a unique opportunity to study accretion/ejection and related phenomena on\nhuman timescales (Mirabel & Rodr\u0131\u0301guez 1999). Although the\ntotal number of known MQ sources in the Galaxy is around 16\n(Rib\u00f3 2003), this number could increase up to \u223c40 if, as it has\nbeen suggested by Fender & Hendry (2000), all Radio Emitting\nX-ray Binaries (REXBs), are MQs. In any case, it is desirable\nto enlarge the MQ population to allow meaningful statistical\nstudies. To this end, Paredes et al. (2002) have recently carried\nout a search for new REXBs at galactic latitudes of |b| < 5\u25e6 ,\nand although the first results were promising (Rib\u00f3 et al. 2002),\nSend offprint requests to: J. A. Combi,\ne-mail: pauletich@sinectis.com.ar\n\nrecent optical spectroscopic observations (Mart\u0131\u0301 et al. 2004) reveal that most of the studied sources, if not all, are extragalactic\nquasars.\nOn the other hand, with the advent of the X-ray/\u03b3-ray\nINTEGRAL satellite the possibility to find new MQ candidates\nhas increased. During the last months, a few highly absorbed\nhard X-ray sources have been discovered with the IBIS detector on the galactic plane towards the Norma spiral arm (e.g.\nIGR J16318\u22124848, Revnivtsev et al. 2003; IGR J16320\u22124751,\nRodriguez et al. 2003). These sources present an unusually\nhigh intrinsic hydrogen column density up to 2 \u00d7 1024 cm\u22122 ,\nrevealing a population of dust-enshrouded hard X-ray sources,\nthat are difficult to detect below 5 keV. Although at present the\nnature of these sources remains unclear, it is believed that they\ncould be high mass X-ray binary systems (Revnivtsev 2003),\nand eventually dust-enshrouded MQs.\nWith the aim to discover new MQs we have focused our\nattention on several yet unexplored potential sources. In this\npaper, we present an in-depth study of the unidentified X-ray\nsource AX J1639.0\u22124642, that was discovered with ASCA\n(Sugizaki et al. 2001), and show that it may be a MQ. We\npresent a re-analysis of the ASCA data in Sect. 2, we describe\n\n\f2\n\nJ. A.

Re-analysis of the ASCA data of\nAX J1639.0\u22124642\nThe unidentified X-ray source AX J1639.0\u22124642 was discovered by the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and\nAstrophysics (ASCA) observatory during a survey of the central region of the galactic plane, performed in the 0.7\u201310 keV\nenergy range (Sugizaki et al. 2001). The source is superimposed to the galactic Norma spiral arm, and located at (l, b) =\n(337.\u25e6993, +0.\u25e6072), (\u03b1, \u03b4)J2000.0 = (16h 39m 04.s 3, \u221246\u25e642\u2032 47\u2032\u2032 )\n(90% or 1.6\u03c3 uncertainty of 1\u2032 ). It presented a flux of\nFX(0.7\u221210 keV) = (19.2 \u00b1 2.2) \u00d7 10\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (and variable X-ray emission with a confidence \u2265 99%). Its spectrum\nwas fit with a power-law with a very hard photon index \u0393 =\n\u22120.01+0.66\n\u22120.60 and a poorly constrained hydrogen column density\n22\n\u22122\nof NH = 12.82+8.58\n\u22126.88 \u00d7 10 cm . The source has recently been\ndetected by the IBIS telescope onboard the INTEGRAL satellite (Malizia et al. 2004).\n\n2.1. Observations and data reduction\nIn order to investigate in more detail the properties of this Xray source, we have re-analyzed the original ASCA data. The\nobservations were performed on 1997 September 10, with two\ndifferent pointings in the overlapped region of successive GIS\nfields of view. The first pointed observation (OBS#1) started\non 07:01:34 (UT) and had an exposure time of 11 ks, while the\nsecond one (OBS#2) started on 12:41:50 (UT) and lasted 6 ks.\nThe source was located at an off-axis angle of 20\u2032 and 14\u2032 from\nthe optical axis of the X-ray telescope in OBS#1 and OBS#2,\nrespectively.\nThe data reduction and the extraction of events was performed based on the standard procedure, as described in\nSugizaki et al. (2001). The source events were extracted from\na circular region of 3 mm radius on the GIS detector around\nthe source position. Since the background is angle-dependent,\nit was collected from a source-free region with the same offaxis angle as the source. The data of the GIS-2 and the GIS-3\nwere summed to gain photon statistics.\n\n2.2. Lightcurve\nIn order to examine the time variability of AX J1639.0\u22124642,\nwe extracted lightcurves and fitted them with a constant model.\nWe show in Fig. 1 the lightcurves obtained throughout the two\npointed observations in the total energy band 0.7\u201310 keV, and\nin the energy bands of 0.7\u20135 and 5\u201310 keV. The best-fit constant model and the reduced chi-squared (\u03c72\u03bd ) of each lightcurve\nare also shown in Fig. 1.\nIn the 0.7\u20135 keV range, the values of \u03c72\u03bd are within the 90%\nconfidence limits, thus the flux can be considered to be constant. However, in the 5\u201310 keV range, the \u03c72\u03bd values are over\nthe 99% confidence limits, which implies that the flux is significantly variable. Nevertheless, the photon statistics are not\n\nFig. 1. Background subtracted GIS lightcurves of AX J1639.0\u22124642\nin 0.7\u201310 keV (top), 0.7\u20135 keV (middle) and 5\u201310 keV (bottom)\nthroughout OBS#1 (0\u20132\u00d7104 s) and OBS#2 (2\u20134\u00d7104 s). Error bars\nrepresent 1\u03c3 statistical uncertainty. Dashed lines represent the bestfit constant models. Reduced chi-squared (\u03c72\u03bd ) and degree of freedom\n(d.o.f.) of the best-fit models are shown together. The different average\ncount rates between OBS#1 and OBS#2 are explained by the change\nof the source position on the detector.\n\ngood enough to conclude that the source has larger variability\nin the hard band than in the soft band.\n\n2.3. Spectral analysis\nThe spectral parameters of AX J1639.0\u22124642 in the ASCA\ngalactic faint source survey in Sugizaki et al. (2001) were based\non the OBS#1 data. However, in OBS#1 the source was observed at a large off-axis angle of 20\u2032 , where the response function of the X-ray telescope is not well calibrated. Therefore, we\nhave re-analyzed the X-ray spectrum using the OBS#2 data,\nwhen the source was observed with a lower off-axis angle of\n14\u2032 . All spectral uncertainties represent 90% confidence limits,\nhereafter. We show in Fig. 2 the obtained X-ray spectrum in\nOBS#2. We first fitted the spectrum with a power-law model\nwith an absorption of neutral matter of solar abundance.

These values are consistent with those from\nOBS#1 in the ASCA galactic faint X-ray catalog, although the\nflux is somehow smaller. The obtained value for \u0393\u223c0 is very\npoorly constrained, and is certainly smaller than the typical values of \u0393>1 found in other X-ray binaries. Therefore, in order\nto estimate a more realistic absorption column density, we next\nfitted the spectrum with the power-law model fixing the photon\nindex \u0393 to be 1, which is typical of hard X-ray sources such\nas HMXBs. The obtained acceptable range of NH in 90% con22\nfidence was 30+12\ncm\u22122 .

Multiwavelength study of the AX J1639.0\u22124642\nfield\nWith the aim of finding any possible radio counterpart within\nthe location error box of the X-ray source, we have used\nthe Molonglo Galactic Plane Survey (MGPS) conducted at\n843 MHz with the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope\n(MOST) (Green et al. 1999). Observations of the region of\ninterest were conducted on 1990 June 9 and on 1992 April\n16. We show in Fig. 3 the MOST contour image of the surroundings of AX J1639.0\u22124642 obtained during the second\nrun. A bright radio source (hereafter MOST J1639.0\u22124642)\ncan be clearly seen well within the error box of the X-ray\nsource.

The radio source\nMOST J1639.0\u22124642 is well within the 90% uncertainty error circle\nof the X-ray source AX J1639.0\u22124642. Contours are \u22122, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,\n7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 times the rms noise level of 10 mJy. The ellipse\non the top right corner is the convolving beam of 59.2\u00d743.0 arcsec in\nPA=0\u25e6 .\n\nis point-like when considering the beam size and the presence of nearby sources. We have fitted the images of the two\nepochs with Gaussian functions and we have obtained peak\nflux densities of 140 \u00b1 14 and 132 \u00b1 11 mJy beam\u22121 , respectively. The position of the radio source in galactic and equatorial coordinates is (l, b) = (337.\u25e6995, +0.\u25e6079), (\u03b1, \u03b4)J2000.0 =\n(16h 39m 03.s 0, \u221246\u25e642\u2032 20\u2032\u2032 ) (3\u03c3 uncertainty of 15\u2032\u2032 ). We note\nthat although the formal errors in right ascension and declination of MGPS are 1\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 1\u2032\u2032 csc |\u03b4| for sources stronger than\n20 mJy, sidelobes from nearby strong sources can make these\nuncertainties much higher. In fact, the peak and the fitted\nGaussian center positions in the two epochs change by several\narcseconds. Therefore, we have estimated the 1\u03c3 error radius\nin position to be 5\u2032\u2032 .\nIn order to search for the radio source at higher frequencies, we have inspected the data from the 4.85 GHz PMN\nsingle dish survey (Condon et al. 1993). We applied to these\ndata an additional Gaussian filtering process (see Combi et al.\n1998 for details) to remove the background diffuse radiation\non scales larger than 8\u2032 . After several iterations no radio source\nwas found up to a 3\u03c3 level of \u223c15 mJy.\nAt near infrared (NIR) wavelengths we have inspected\nthe 2 Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS, Cutri et al. 2003),\nand found 10 sources in the 3\u03c3 error circle in position of\nMOST J1639.0\u22124642, some of them visible in the K s -band image shown in Fig. 4. At optical wavelengths we have queried\nthe USNO-B1.0 catalog (Monet et al. 2003), and found 6\nsources in the same error circle, being 3 of them located within\n1 arcsecond of 2MASS sources.\n\n\f4\n\nJ.

Several NIR sources from the 2MASS catalog are possible counterparts of both sources.\n\nAt the far infrared part of the spectrum, from 12 to 100\nmicrons, we have found that the source IRAS 16353\u221246361\nlies inside the error box of the X-ray source. This infrared\nsource is located at (l, b) = (337.\u25e6995, +0.\u25e6077), (\u03b1, \u03b4)J2000.0 =\n(16h 39m 03.s 5, \u221246\u25e642\u2032 28\u2032\u2032 ) (95% or 2\u03c3 uncertainty ellipse of\n14\u2032\u2032 \u00d74\u2032\u2032 in PA=97\u25e6 ). The infrared fluxes at 12, 25, 60 and 100\nmicrons are 12.5\u00b10.6, 73.3\u00b13.7, <806 (3\u03c3 upper limit) and\n2230\u00b1330 Jy, respectively.

This source\noverlaps the southern part of the MOST J1639.0\u22124642 3\u03c3 position error circle, and its uncertainty ellipse in position contains several 2MASS sources, as can be seen in Fig. 4.\nThe X-ray source AX J1639.0\u22124642 has been recently\nre-discovered at higher energies with the IBIS telescope onboard the INTEGRAL satellite, dubbed IGR J16393\u22124643\n(Malizia et al. 2004). It is located at (l, b) = (338.\u25e602, +0.\u25e604),\n(\u03b1, \u03b4)J2000.0 = (16h 39m 18s , \u221246\u25e643\u2032 00\u2032\u2032 ) (90% or 1.6\u03c3 uncertainty of 2\u2032 ). We note that although this error circle does not\ninclude neither the center of AX J1639.0\u22124642 nor the source\nMOST J1639.0\u22124642, both sources fall within the 2\u03c3 error circle of IGR J16393\u22124643. This source shows an average flux of\nFX(20\u2212100 keV) \u2243 5 \u00d7 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , and presents a factor of\n2\u20133 flux variability on timescales of months.\nFinally, it is interesting to point out that AX J1639.0\u22124642\nlies inside the 95% location contour of the unidentified \u03b3-ray\nsource 3EG J1639\u22124702 (Hartman et al. 1999), as can be seen\nin Fig. 5.

Discussion\n\n4.1. On the nature of AX J1639.0\u22124642\nAt radio wavelengths, the detection at 843 MHz (observations\non 1990 June 9 and 1992 April 16) and the non-simultaneous\nnon-detection at 4.85 GHz (observations in 1990 JanuaryMarch), imply that either the source is highly variable on\ntimescales of months or that it has a steep spectral index\n\u03b1 < \u22121 (defined in such a way that S\u03bd \u221d \u03bd+\u03b1 ). In both cases,\na non-thermal origin of the radio emission is clearly favored.\nTherefore, the radio source detected inside the error box of\nAX J1639.0\u22124642 could be the manifestation of synchrotron\nemission from a jet.\nThe flux variability of AX J1639.0\u22124642 shown in Fig. 1\nand the X-ray spectrum shown in Fig. 2 suggest that it is a\nHMXB, as already pointed out by Sugizaki et al. (2001). In\naddition, AX J1639.0\u22124642 appears to be a persistent X-ray\nsource, since it was detected by ASCA and INTEGRAL, which\nsupports again a HMXB. Finally, the factor of 2\u20133 flux variability on timescales of months of IGR J16393\u22124643 also points\ntowards a HMXB.\nThe obtained value of NH above 1023 cm\u22122 is reminiscent of the population of persistent and highly absorbed IGR\nsources detected by INTEGRAL towards the Norma spiral arm,\na region of high concentration of atomic and molecular gas,\nand OB stars. All these IGR sources (e.g. IGR J16318\u22124848,\nRevnivtsev et al. 2003; IGR J16320\u22124751, Rodriguez et al.\n2003) present rather similar hard X-ray spectra, which is typical of HMXB systems. The most interesting characteristic of\nthese sources is the variable hydrogen column density measured in different observations, a fact that supports an intrinsic\nabsorption of the sources.\n\n\fJ.

Using the PL model\nwith \u0393=1, AV ranges between \u223c120\u2013240 magnitudes.\nThe higher estimated values of AV could be consistent with\nthe binary system lying inside a molecular cloud, a possibility\nsupported by the presence of the CO molecular cloud located\nbetween 8\u201312 kpc (Fig. 17 in Torres et al. 2003). Alternatively,\nthe binary system could be enshrouded by a dense dust envelope, as it has been proposed for the IGR sources discussed\nabove. In any of these cases, we would not expect to detect the\nNIR/optical counterpart.\nHowever, variable absorption has been measured in\nIGR J16318\u22124848 through RXTE and XMM observations on\ntimescales of months (Revnivtsev 2003). Moreover, in a study\nof the properties of the absorbing and line emitting material in\nthis source, Matt & Guainazzi (2003) have observed that the\niron K\u03b1 line varies on timescales as short as 1000 s, implying\nthat the emitting region should have the size of the binary system. This is consistent with a picture in which the absorbing\nmaterial is due to the stream flowing through the Lagrangian\npoint to form an accretion disk. Although the ASCA data is\nconsistent with a constant X-ray flux below 5 keV, the poor\nstatistics below 2\u20133 keV do not prevent a similar situation to\noccur in AX J1639.0\u22124642. In such a case, the absorbing material would be placed within the binary system and very close\nto the compact object, and we could expect a low value of the\nextinction towards the companion star, which could be eventually detected.\nAlthough we do not have spectrophotometric information\nof a NIR/optical counterpart in order to derive a distance to the\nsource, assuming that it is located in the Scutum-Crux or in the\nNorma spiral arms, the galactic longitude of l = 338\u25e6 leads to\ndistances in the range between 3 and 13 kpc.\nAll these results show that the source AX J1639.0\u22124642\n(=IGR J16393\u22124643) clearly deserves further attention. High\nresolution multifrequency radio observations have recently\nbeen conducted to assess the expected non-thermal nature of\nthe emission, to infer physical parameters, to look for eventually extended emission and to provide a better position estimate of the source, to check if it is positionally coincident with\nIRAS 16353\u22124636 and to look for a NIR counterpart.

X-ray and soft \u03b3-ray observations with currently orbiting satellites will allow to obtain\na much better position estimate of AX J1639.0\u22124642 and will\nconstrain the spectral parameters of the source, such as the photon index and specially the hydrogen column density and look\nfor its eventual variability.\n\n4.2. Microquasars as possible counterparts of\nunidentified EGRET sources\nAs reported in the previous section, AX J1639.0\u22124642\ncould be associated with the unidentified high-energy \u03b3-ray\nsource 3EG J1639\u22124702. Although Torres et al. (2001b)\nhave found three radio pulsars inside the 95% confidence\ncontour of the \u03b3-ray source, its possible variability (index I = 1.95) and steep photon index (\u0393\u03b3 = 2.50 \u00b1\n0.18) do not seem to agree with a pulsar origin. Similarly,\nthese properties would rule out an association with the three\nSNRs found in the 95% confidence contour (Torres et al.\n2003). Moreover, no identified blazar has been found within\nthe \u03b3-ray contours. Therefore, we suggest that the microquasar candidate AX J1639.0\u22124642/MOST J1639.0\u22124642\n(=IGR J16393\u22124643) is the counterpart of 3EG J1639\u22124702.\nThe possibility of MQ being \u03b3-ray emitters has been suggested by Paredes et al. (2000), who proposed the association between the HMXB LS 5039 and the unidentified EGRET\nsource 3EG J1824\u22121514. In their scenario the \u03b3-rays are produced by Inverse Compton upscattering of stellar UV photons\nby the non-thermal relativistic electron population that later on\nwill produce the detected radio emission. On the other hand, the\nX-ray binary system LS I +61 303 has been associated with the\nEGRET source 3EG J0241+6103 (Tavani et al. 1996; Kniffen\net al. 1997; Strickman et al. 1998; Harrison et al. 2000), and\nrecently Massi et al. (2001, 2004) have revealed its MQ nature. If the MQ nature of AX J1639.0\u22124642 is confirmed, it\ncould be the third MQ source related to a high-energy gammaray source detected by the EGRET telescope. We quote the\nbasic properties of these three \u03b3-ray sources in Table 3, together with the properties of the proposed X-ray counterparts.\nIt should be noted that LS 5039 and LS I +61 303, and probably\nAX J1639.0\u22124642, have massive optical companions, which\nprovide a stellar UV photon field. On the other hand, the compact object appears to be compatible with a neutron star in the\n\n\f6\n\nJ. A.

In addition, it is interesting to\npoint out that the luminosities obtained in each spectral domain\nare very similar in all three sources, specially for the shorter\ndistances to AX J1639.0\u22124642, giving support to the idea that\nall of them have similar emission processes.\nIn this context, Kaufman Bernad\u00f3 et al. (2002) have recently presented a model for galactic \u03b3-ray emission based on\nprecessing MQ with a jet pointing close to the line of sight\n(or microblazars). Depending on the parameters introduced in\nthe model, such MQs can explain sources with \u03b3-ray luminosities in the range of 1034 \u20131038 erg s\u22121 in the observer's frame,\nperfectly consistent with the values quoted in Table 3 for all\nthree sources. More recently, Romero et al. (2003) have introduced a new mechanism for the generation of high-energy \u03b3rays in MQs, based on hadronic interactions occurring outside\nthe coronal X-ray region. The three gamma-ray sources under\nconsideration could be part of this hadronic microblazar population.\nObservations with the future missions AGILE and\nGLAST will confirm or reject the proposed association between AX J1639.0\u22124642 and the high-energy \u03b3-ray source\n3EG J1639\u22124702.\n\n5. Conclusions\nIn this paper we have re-analyzed the ASCA data of the Xray source AX J1639.0\u22124642 (=IGR J16393\u22124643) and presented a multiwavelength study of emission in the direction of\nthe source from radio to \u03b3-rays. The huge hydrogen column\ndensity, hard spectral index and flux variability suggest that the\nsource is a dust-enshrouded HMXB system. We have found a\nnon-thermal radio source inside its error circle that could be the\nmanifestation of synchrotron emission from a jet, hence supporting its microquasar nature. On the other hand, apart from\nAX J1639.0\u22124642, there are no other known candidate sources\nwithin the 95% location contours of 3EG J1639\u22124702 capable\nto generate the GeV emission detected by EGRET. All these\nfacts suggest that AX J1639.0\u22124642 (=IGR J16393\u22124643) is\nprobably a dust-enshrouded galactic microquasar with highenergy \u03b3-ray emission.\nAcknowledgements.
