A\nsignature changing spacetime is a manifold which contains both Euclidean and Lorentzian regions [5, 6]. In\nclassical general relativity, the metric which represents signature change must be either degenerate (vanishing\ndeterminant) or discontinuous. On the other hand, Einstein's equations implicitly assume that the metric is\nnon-degenerate and at least continuous [7].\nIn more recent times, a number of authors have studied this problem when a scalar field is coupled to Einstein's field equations and shown that the resulting solutions, when properly parameterized, exhibit signature\ntransition [8, 9, 10, 11]. In a similar way, a classical model is studied in Ref. [12] in which a self-interacting\nscalar field is coupled to Einstein's equations with a Sinh-Gordon interaction potential. The field equations are\n\u2217 Email:\n\u2020 Email:\n\npouria.pedram@gmail.com\ns-jalalzadeh@sbu.ac.ir\n\n1\n\n\fsolved exactly for the scale factor and scalar field which give rise to a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker\n(FRW) cosmology with signature changing properties. The case of the non-flat Universe is addressed in [13]\nwith a discussion about the conditions under which signature transition exists. It is well known that in classical\nsignature change spacetimes, we have some junction conditions on the signature changing hypersurface. On\nthe other hand, there is no any satisfactory unique junction condition (see [14, 15] and references therein). At\nthe quantum cosmology level the same issue is investigated in Ref. [16] with an analysis pertaining to the exact\nsolutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. Signature transition has also been studied in multi-dimensional\nclassical and quantum cosmology [17] where a 4 + d-dimensional spacetime is minimally coupled to a scalar\nfield. The coupling between spinor field and gravity based on FRW and Bianchi cosmological models are also\naddressed in Refs. [18, 19], respectively. Also, it has been used as a compactification mechanism for KaluzaKlein cosmology [20, 21] with a cosmological constant. Finally, the issue of the classically signature change in\nthe brane world models is studied in [22].\nIn this paper, we consider a smooth signature changing type spacetime. First, we study the classical\nsolutions with one component perfect fluid and show that the solutions do not extend to the Euclidian region.\nThen, we construct the corresponding quantum cosmological model via Schutz's variational formalism which\nhas been attracted much attentions in recent times [23, 24]. By canonical quantization of this model, we can\navoid the singularity and consequently, we obtain the signature changing type metric. At last, we show that\nthe quantum signature change scenario can be reproduced exactly by a classical model where a repulsive fluid\nis added to the normal perfect fluid. The repulsive fluid can be given by a stiff matter equation of state p = \u03c1,\nindependently of the content of the normal fluid.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Sec. 2, the quantum cosmological model with a perfect fluid as the\nmatter content is constructed in Schutz's formalism [25], and the Schr\u00f6dinger-Wheeler-DeWitt (SWD) equation\nin minisuperspace is written down to quantize the model. The wave function depends on the scale factor a\nand the canonical variable associated to the fluid, which in the Schutz's variational formalism plays the role\nof time T . We separate the wave function into two parts, one depending solely on the scale factor and the\nother depending only on the time. The solution in the time sector of the SWD equation is trivial, leading to\nimaginary exponentials of type eiET , where E is the energy of the system. Then, we construct the wave packets\n\n2\n\n\ffrom the eigenfunctions and compute the time-dependent expectation value of the scale factors. We analyze\nthe results in the context of signature change and construct the classical analogue of quantum solutions via\nadding a repulsive perfect fluid. In Sec. 3, we present our conclusions.\n\n2\n\nThe model\n\nThe action for gravity plus perfect fluid in Schutz's formalism is written as\nA\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nM\n\n\u221a\nd x \u2212g R + 2\n4\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\u221a\nab\nd x h hab K +\n3\n\n\u2202M\n\nM\n\n\u221a\nd4 x \u2212g p\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere hab is the induced metric over the three-dimensional spatial hypersurface, which is the boundary \u2202M\nof the four dimensional manifold M and K ab is the extrinsic curvature. We choose units such that the factor\n16\u03c0G becomes equal to one. The first two terms were first obtained in [26] and the last term (1) represents\nthe matter contribution to the total action. Perfect fluid satisfies the barotropic equation of state\np = \u03b1\u03c1.\n\n(2)\n\nIn Schutz's formalism [25] the fluid's four-velocity is expressed in terms of five potentials \u01eb, \u03b6, \u03b2, \u03b8 and S:\nu\u03bd =\n\n1\n(\u01eb,\u03bd + \u03b6\u03b2,\u03bd + \u03b8S,\u03bd ),\n\u03bc\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03bc is the specific enthalpy and S is the specific entropy. The potentials \u03b6 and \u03b2 are connected with rotation\nand are absent in FRW models and the variables \u01eb and \u03b8 have no clear physical meaning. The four-velocity\nsatisfies the following normalization condition\nu\u03bd u\u03bd = \u22121.\n\n(4)\n\nThe Hartle-Hawking no-boundary proposal [1, 3, 4] implies that spacetime is partly Euclidian and partly\nLorentzian. The motivation of this proposal involves the path integral formulation of quantum gravity. To\nhave a feeling about the quantum theory it is necessary to have an understanding of the associated classical\ntheory by constructing the classical spacetime with signature changing structure. In fact, there are two main\nproposals for this purpose. In the first proposal, the metric of spacetime is everywhere non-degenerate but\nfails to be continuous at the surface that divides the Euclidian from the Lorentzian region. On the other hand,\n3\n\n\fin the second proposition, metric is everywhere smooth but is degenerate at the surface of signature change\n[8, 10, 27, 28].\nHere, we are interested to use the second one. The authors of Ref. [29] have shown that for smooth signature\nchanging spacetime there exist coordinates such that\nds2 = \u2212N 2 (t)tdt2 + hij dxi dxj .\n\n(5)\n\nFor this case, Kossowski and Kriele [30] have shown that the energy-momentum tensor of the matter field\nbecomes bounded if and only if the signature change hypersurface (\u03a3) is totally geodesic and \u2202t hij = 0 at \u03a3 .\nTo proceed further, let us consider the signature changing FRW metric as\nds2 = \u2212N 2 (t)tdt2 + a2 (t)gij dxi dxj ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere N 2 > 0 and is now inserted in action (1). In this expression, N (t) is the lapse function and gij\nis the metric on the constant-curvature spatial section. Using the constraints for the fluid, and after some\nthermodynamical considerations and dropping the surface terms, the final reduced action takes the form [31].\nA=\n\nZ\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u02272 a\n\u03b1\nS\n1/2\n\u22121/\u03b1 \u22121/2\u03b1 3\n1/\u03b1+1\ndt \u22126 1/2 + 6\u03baN t a + N\nt\na\n(\u01eb\u0307 + \u03b8\u1e60)\nexp \u2212\n,\n\u03b1\nt N\n(\u03b1 + 1)1/\u03b1+1\n\u0014\n\n(7)\n\nwhere dot denotes the derivation with respect to t.

Moreover, for \u03b1 6= 1 the scale factor vanishes and the\nenergy-momentum tensor is not bounded. Therefore, we can not construct the signature changing spacetime\nusing simple perfect fluid in the classical domain. In fact, in order to have this type of spacetime in classical\ncosmology, we need some kinds of scalar fields with suitable potential term that can provide the signature\nchange [12].\nImposing the standard quantization conditions on the canonical momenta and demanding that the superHamiltonian operator annihilate the wave function, we are led to the following SWD equation in the minisu-\n\n5\n\n\fperspace with general factor ordering (h\u0304 = 1)\n1\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n1 \u2202 1 \u2202 1\n1 \u2202 1 \u2202 1\n+ k\ni\nj\nk\na \u2202a a \u2202a a\na \u2202a aj \u2202a ai\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03c8(a, T ) \u2212 144\u03baa\u03c8(a, T ) \u2212 i24a\u22123\u03b1\n\n\u2202\u03c8(a, T )\n= 0.\n\u2202T\n\n(15)\n\nWhere i + j + k = 1.

The avoidance of the singularity is due to the repulsive force Fa = \u2212\u2202Q(a, T )/\u2202a extracted from\nthe quantum potential. To show this, we can write the super-Hamiltonian for the flat case in Bohmian picture\nas\nHB = \u2212\n\nC\npT\n6a\u02272\n+ 3\u03b1 \u2212 3 .\nN 2t\na\na\n\n(41)\n\nNow, the zero energy condition yields\n6\nN 2t\n\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u0227\npT\nC\n= 3(\u03b1+1) \u2212 6 .\na\na\na\n\n(42)\n\nThe sign of the left hand side of the above equation is negative for the negative values of t and positive for\nt > 0. Consequently the sign of the right hand side changes as well. Hence the right hand side vanishes at\nt = 0. Now, since we have solutions both for t < 0 and t > 0, there should therefore exist signature changing\nhypersurface so that a \u221d (C/PT )1/3(1\u2212\u03b1) = a0 . Also it is easy to see from equation (42) that the scale factor\nis less than a0 for negative values of t and grater than a0 for the positive values of t. Hence, this equation\npredicts the existence of three regions, namely, a Lorentzian domain, a signature changing hypersurface and\nan Euclidean domain. Therefore, since the discussion above is independent of the choice of N , the quantum\nsignature change behavior is in fact gauge independent.\nThe solutions (28) show a continuous transition from a finite Euclidean domain to the Lorentzian one. It\nis easy to show that\n\u2202t hai|t=0\n\n= 0,\n\n(43)\n\n\u2202t \u2202t hai|t=0\n\n= 0,\n\n(44)\n\nwhich satisfy the Kossowski and Kriele mentioned theorem. Hence, in general, the quantum model predicts a\nsignature change model when the singularity is approached. Moreover, the quantum effect leads to a repulsive\nforce which results in a regular transition from Euclidean to the Lorentzian region.\nThe above discussion shows that one of the curious features of quantum cosmology is the use of Riemannian\nsignature spaces to explain the origin of the observable Lorentzian signature Universe. There are various\ninterpretations of this, the simplest of which is that the signature of the universe was initially Riemannian and\n9\n\n\fthen subsequently changed. It may be argued that the Lorentzian signature is an independent assumption of\nrelativity rather than a consequence, with the theory being equally valid for Riemannian signature, and that in\na quantum theory of gravity it would be unnatural to impose signature restrictions on the metric. The question\narises as to whether the qualitative predictions of quantum cosmology can be obtained from purely classical\nrelativity by relaxing the assumption of Lorentzian signature. Also in order to understand the quantum theory\nit is necessary to have an understanding of the associated classical theory i.e., the theory of classical spacetimes\nwith signature type change.\nNow, we try to construct the classical analogous to the quantum signature change cosmology. One way of\nimplementing a repulsive phase in classical cosmology is to consider two fluids, one that acts attractively, and\nthe other that acts repulsively [36]. It is desirable that the repulsive fluid dominates for the small values of the\nscale factor, whereas the attractive fluid dominates for the large values of the scale factor. For the flat case,\nwe can obtain the possible model in signature change coordinate (6) as\n1\nN 2t\n\n\u0012 \u00132\nC1\n\u0227\nC2\n= 8\u03c0G (\u03c1M \u2212 \u03c1Q ) = m \u2212 n ,\na\na\na\n\n(45)\n\nwhere pM = \u03b1M \u03c1M , pQ = \u03b1Q \u03c1Q , m = 3(1 + \u03b1M ) and n = 3(1 + \u03b1Q ). The subscripts M and Q stand for\n\"normal\" matter component and for \"quantum\" repulsive component, respectively.\nSince the normal matter corresponds to \u03b1M = \u22121, 0, 13 , and it is also desirable that the repulsive component\ndominates at small values of the scale factor, we choose \u03b1Q >\n\n1\n3.\n\nWith due attention to (42), we choose a\n\nrepulsive stiff matter fluid \u03b1Q = 1, which leads to n = 6. Then, the solution is\n1\nN 2t\n\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u0227\nC1\nC2\n= 3(1+\u03b1) \u2212 6 .\na\na\na\n\n(46)\n\nThis equation can be solved by reparametrizing the time coordinate as\nt1/2 dt = dT,\n\n(47)\n\nwhich results in\n\u0012\n\na\u2032\na\n\n\u00132\n\n= C1 a\u22123(1\u2212\u03b1) \u2212 C2 a\u22126(1\u2212\u03b1) ,\n\n(48)\n\nwhere the prime means derivation with respect to T .

Therefore,\nthe quantum solutions are equivalent to the classical solutions where gravity is coupled to the same perfect\nfluid plus a repulsive fluid with a stiff matter equation of state pQ = \u03c1Q .\nThe comparison between classical (49) and quantum (28) solutions can fix C1 and C2 as\nC1 =\n\n\u0393( 2l + 1)\n\u0393( 2l +\n\n2\u22123\u03b1\n3\u22123\u03b1 )\n\n!1\u2212\u03b1\n\n3 1/3 (1 \u2212 \u03b1)2\n3\n,\n8\n\u03b3 1/3\n\nC2 =\n\n\u0393( 2l + 1)\n\u0393( 2l +\n\n2\u22123\u03b1\n3\u22123\u03b1 )\n\n!\u22122(1\u2212\u03b1)\n\n3 1/3 (1 \u2212 \u03b1)2\n3\n.\n4\n\u03b3 4/3\n\n(50)\n\nNow we can check the null energy condition (\u03c1 + p \u2265 0) in order to investigate the avoidance of the singularity\nin comoving coordinate.\nThe existence of a repulsive term implies that the energy conditions are violated as the singularity is\napproached, leading to its avoidance. If we define \u03c1ef f and pef f as the sum of the energy and pressure for\nboth attractive and repulsive fluids and using the solutions (49), with an unimportant absorbtion of integration\nconstant in the definition of the time coordinate, we have\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2032\u2032\n\u20322\n4\n\u2212 aa + (1 + 3\u03b1) aa2\n\u03c1ef f + pef f = a6\u03b1\n\u0014\n\u0015\n(1+\u03b1)T 2 \u2212(1\u2212\u03b1)\n1\n8\n,\n= a6\u03b1\n2\n2\n2\n3(1\u2212\u03b1)\n(T +1)\nwhich is negative for T <\nchange hypersurfaces.\n\nq\n\n1\u2212\u03b1\n1+\u03b1 .\n\n(51)\n\nTherefore, for \u03b1 < 1 the null energy condition is violated around the signature\n\nRepulsive gravitational effects in classical general relativity can also be generated by self interacting scalar\nfields to which an effective energy density and an effective pressure can be associated such that\n\uf8f1\n\u03c6\u03072\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2p\u03c6 = 2 \u2212 U (\u03c6),\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n(52)\n\n2\n\n\u03c6\u0307\n\u03c1\u03c6 = 2 + U (\u03c6).\n\nA convenient choice for the potential U (\u03c6) may lead to the repulsive effect and consequently we have classical\nsignature change.

The use of Schutz's formalism for perfect fluid allowed us to\nobtain a SWD equation in which the only remaining matter degree of freedom plays the role of time. We\nfound the eigenfunctions with arbitrary choices of factor ordering. Physically acceptable wave packets were\nconstructed by appropriate linear combination of these eigenfunctions. The time evolution of the expectation\nvalue of the scale factor has been determined in the spirit of the many worlds and ontological interpretations of\nquantum cosmology. We have also explored the possibility of having solutions that are described by degenerate\nmetrics signifying transition from a Euclidean to a Lorentzian domain at quantum level. Moreover, we have\nshown that adding a repulsive stiff matter to the classical scenario can reproduce the quantum signature\nchanging results. Finally, we discussed the construction of the self interacting scalar fields which give rise to\nclassical signature change scenario.\n\nReferences\n[1] J. B. Hartle, and S. W. Hawking, Phys. Rev.
