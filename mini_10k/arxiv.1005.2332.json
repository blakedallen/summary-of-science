This effect is\nattributed to the elastic tension developed in the chain due to the action of the myosin motors.\nWe also show that as a result of this tension, the attachment probability of the motors is greatly\nreduced and becomes strongly dependent on the length of the chain. These surprising effects point\nto the necessity of considering the elasticity of the cytoskeleton in theoretical studies of cooperative\ndynamics of molecular motors.\nPACS numbers: 87.16.Ka, 87.16.Nn, 87.16.Uv, 87.16.A-\n\nMotor proteins are molecular machines that convert\nchemical energy into mechanical work by ATP hydrolysis. They \"walk\" on the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton and pull vesicles or organelles across the cell [1]. The\nintracellular transport of cargoes is achieved mainly by\nthe action of individual motors which propagate along\nthe cytoskeleton tracks in a direction determined by the\nintrinsic polarity of the filaments [2]. Other processes,\nsuch as cell motility and mitosis, require the cooperative\nwork of many motors. Muscle contraction, for instance,\ninvolves the simultaneous action of hundreds of myosin\nII motors pulling on attached actin filaments and causing them to slide against each other [3]. One interesting outcome of cooperative action of molecular motors\nis their ability to generate bidirectional motion [4]. Bidirectional movement results from the competition between\ntwo populations of motors that work against each other\nin opposite directions [4\u20138]. The direction of motion flips\nfrom one direction to the other due to stochastic events\nof binding and unbinding of motors to the filament which\ntip the force balance between the two motor groups.\nThe dynamics of motor-filament systems are often\nstudied using in vitro motility assays in which the filaments glide over a dense bed of immobilized motors and\ntheir motion is tracked by fluorescent microscopy [9]. Recently, we used such a motility assay to study the dynamics of actin bundles induced by the cooperative action of\nmyosin II motors [10]. The bundles in these experiments\nwere composed of short actin segments which, through\na sequence of fusion events, assemble into filaments with\nrandomly alternating polarities. Such a-polar bundles exhibit \"back and forth\" bidirectional motion. We showed\nthat the distribution of \"reversal times\" (i.e., the durations of unidirectional intervals of motion) take an exponential form P (\u2206t) \u223c exp (\u2212\u2206t/\u03c4rev ), where \u03c4rev is the\ncharacteristic reversal time of the bidirectional motion\n[10, 11]. Detailed analysis of the dynamics of many bun-\n\ndles revealed that \u03c4rev is of the order of a few second and\nhas no dependence on the length (number of monomers,\nN ) of the bundle. This result was in marked contradiction with previous theoretical models which predicted\nthat \u03c4rev grows exponentially with N [4]. To resolve this\ndisagreement, we have introduced a model that takes into\naccount the elastic energy stored in the actin bundle due\nto the action of the working motors [10, 11]. The elastic energy modifies the rates at which motors attach to\nand detach from the actin and eliminates the exponential\ndependence of \u03c4rev on N .\nOur previous theoretical treatment of cooperative bidirectional motion was based on a mean field calculation\nof the actin elastic energy, ignoring both: (i) the sequential order of the polarities of the monomers, and (ii) the\npositions along the filament where the pulling forces of\nmotors are applied. The mean field elastic energy scales\nas E \u223c N Nc , where Nc is the number of attached motors [10, 11]. Within the mean field picture, the bidirectional motion on perfectly a-polar tracks consisting of\nan equal number of monomers with right-pointing (\"positive\") and left-pointing (\"negative\") polarities has no\nbias, i.e., the intervals of motion in both directions occur\nwith equal probability. In this letter we discuss an interesting effect related to the elasticity of the actin. We\nshow that a-polar elastic filaments may exhibit a biased\nbidirectional motion and achieve a net migration along\nthe motors-coated surface. For myosin II-actin systems,\nwe find that the drift velocity is typically 2-3 orders of\nmagnitude smaller than the velocity of a single myosin\nII motor and is comparable with the speed by which the\nmotors move the a-polar bundle cooperatively during the\nintervals of unidirectional motion. This newly identified\nmechanism of propagation may, therefore, be relevant to\nprocesses of active self-organization of cytoskeletal structures during which filaments are transported and joined\nwith each other by motor proteins.\n\n\f2\n1\n\n2\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\nN\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\nfl = \u2212f\n\n+\n\n+\n\nfl = f\nk\n\nmotors\nFIG. 1: A schematic drawing of the system: A chain of consisting of N monomers with alternating polarities, connected\nto each other by identical springs. The chain lies on a \"bed\"\nof motors, some of which are connected to the monomers. A\nconnected monomer with positive (negative) polarity feels a\npulling force of size +f (\u2212f ). Disconnected monomers experience no force.\n\nTo demonstrate the effect, we consider the chain illustrated in Fig. 1, consisting of N monomers connected by\n(N \u2212 1) identical springs with a spring constant k. Each\nmonomer may be either free and experience no pulling\nforce (f = 0), or attached to one motor in which case it\nis subjected to a force of magnitude f which is directed\nto the right (+f ) for monomers with positive polarities\nand left (\u2212f ) for monomers with negative polarities. The\nmoving velocity of the filament is given by V = ftotal /\u03bb,\nPN\nwhere ftotal =\nl=1 fl is the sum of motor forces applied on the monomers and \u03bb is the friction coefficient\nof the chain. A chain of N monomers has 2N connection configurations, where each such configuration can be\n~ of size N specifying the state\nrepresented by a vector C\n(connected/disconnected) of each monomer. For example, a chain of 4 monomers in which the first and third\nmonomers are connected to motors will be represented by\n~ = (1, 0, 1, 0). Let us also introduce a vector S\n~ whose\nC\ncomponents are related to the polarities of the monomers.\n~ = (1, 1, \u22121, 1), for instance, corresponds to\nThe vector S\na chain of 4 monomers in which the polarities of the first,\nsecond, and fourth monomers is positive while the third\nmonomer has a negative polarity. The drift velocity can\nbe calculated by averaging over all possible connection\nconfigurations of the motors (all possible values of the\n~\nvector C):\n2N\nX\nf \u0010 ~ ~\u0011\n~ \u2261 hV i =\nVdrift (S)\nCj * S Pj ,\n\u03bb\nj=1 j\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Pj is the occurrence probability of the configuration, and the subscript j has been added to \u03bb to account\nfor possible variations in the friction coefficient between\nthe different configurations. The probability Pj depends\non (i) the number of attached motors in the configura~ j k2 , (ii) the attachment probability of\ntion, Nc (j) = kC\na single motor, q, and (iii) the total elastic energy of the\nsprings Ejel :\nPj =\n\nel\n1 Nc (j)\nq\n(1 \u2212 q)(N \u2212Nc (j)) e\u2212\u03b2Ej ,\nZ\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b2 = (kB T )\u22121 is the inverse temperature and\nZ is the partition function of the system. The elastic energy is the sum of the energies of the springs,\nPN \u22121\nEjel = i=1 Fi2 /2k, where Fi is the force stretching (or\ncompressing) the i-th spring. The forces Fi can be calculated using the following steps: (i) calculate the mean\n~ * S)/N\n~\nforce f \u0304 \u2261 ftotal /N = f (C\n, (ii) calculate the access\nforces acting on the monomers fl\u2217 = f Cl Sl \u2212 f \u0304, and (iii)\nsum the access forces applied on all the monomers located\nPi\nPN\non one side of the spring Fi = l=1 fl\u2217 = \u2212 l=i+1 fl\u2217 .\nOur analysis is based on the assumption that variations\n~ (which occur when motors attach to or detach from\nin C\nthe actin track) lead to instantaneous changes in the velocity of the filament which should always be proportional to the total exerted force. This assumption is expected to hold for low Reynolds numbers where inertia\ncan be neglected.\nLet us analyze the dynamics of a chain of size N = 4.\nThere are six different a-polar sequences for a chain of\n~1a = \u2212S\n~1b = (1, 1, \u22121, \u22121), S\n~2a = \u2212S\n~2b =\nthis length: S\n~\n~\n(1, \u22121, 1, \u22121), S3a = \u2212S3b = (1, \u22121, \u22121, 1). It is easy to\nprove that the drift velocity (see Eqs. (1) and (2)) vanishes for the first four sequences which are antisymmetric with respect to reflection around the midpoint. This\nis not the case with the last two symmetric sequences.\n~3a and assume, for\nTo see this, consider the sequence S\nsimplicity, that \u03bbj = \u03bb. In the limit q \u226a 1, one can\nignore the configurations in which more than one out of\nthe four monomers is connected to a motor. This leaves\n~ j = (0, 0, 0, 0), for\nus with only five configurations: (i) C\n4\n~ j = (1, 0, 0, 0)\nwhich Vj = 0 and Pj = (1 \u2212 q) /Z, (ii) C\n~\nand Cj = (0, 0, 0, 1), for which Vj = f /\u03bb and Pj =\n2\n~ j = (0, 1, 0, 0) and\nq(1 \u2212 q)3 e\u2212(7/8)(\u03b2f /2k) /Z, and (iii) C\n~ j = (0, 0, 1, 0), for which Vj = \u2212f /\u03bb and Pj = q(1 \u2212\nC\n2\nq)3 e\u2212(3/8)(\u03b2f /2k) /Z. Substituting this in Eq. (2) gives\n~3a ) = \u2212Vdrift (S\n~3b ) \u2243 \u22122(f /\u03bb)q[e\u2212(3/8)(\u03b2f 2/2k) \u2212\nVdrift (S\n2\ne\u2212(7/8)(\u03b2f /2k) ]. For \u03b2f 2 /2k \u226a 1 we find that the drift\nvelocity increases with a third power of the motor force,\nVdrift \u2243 \u2212(\u03b2/2k\u03bb)f 3 . This power law has a different exponent than 1 \u2013 the scaling exponent for the velocity of\nstiff polar chains.\nTo further investigate this effect, we calculated the drift velocity for chains of N = 4M\n~\nmonomers with sequences of the form S\n=\nM\n2M\nM\nz }| { z }| { z }| {\n(\u22121, . . . , \u22121, 1, . . . , 1, \u22121, . . . , \u22121).\nOur results are\nsummarized in Figs. 2(A) and (B). Fig. 2(A) is based\non a calculation in which the friction coefficient (see\nEq. (1)), \u03bbj = \u03bb0 N , while in Fig. 2(B), we assumed\nthat \u03bbj = \u03bb0 Nc (j).

The lines are guides to the eye.\n\nfigures show that for small chains of size N < 200, the\ndrift velocity increases rapidly with N . For larger chains\n(N > 200), Vdrift behaves differently in Figs. 2(A) and\n(B). In the former it decreases with N , while in the\nlatter it saturates and increases again for N > 600.\nNote also that the different scales of the y-axis in both\nfigures. These differences can be attributed to the\ndifferent values of \u03bbj used in the cases represented by\nFigs. 2(A) and (B). Since for each configuration, the\nratio between the friction coefficients in both cases\nA\nr\u03bb \u2261 \u03bbB\nj /\u03bbj = Nc (j)/N \u2264 1, the drift velocity in\n(B) must always be larger than in (A). Fig. 3 depicts\nthe mean value of r\u03bb (i.e., the mean fraction of connected monomers) as a function of N . For N < 50,\nhr\u03bb i \u2243 q = 0.1 and, accordingly, the ratio between the\ndrift velocities in (B) and (A) in this regime is close\nto one order of magnitude. For N > 50, hr\u03bb i drops\nto values much smaller than q, which implies that the\nfriction coefficient per monomer decreases with N in\ncase (B) and explains why the drift velocity remains high\nand does not decrease sharply as in (A). The decrease in\nthe mean fraction of connected monomers can be traced\nto the fact that configurations with larger Nc (j) have,\nin general, higher elastic energies and, therefore, smaller\n\n\u001c\n\nNc\nN\n\n\u001d\n\n=\n\nq exp(\u2212cN \u03b2f 2 /2k)\n,\n1 \u2212 q[1 \u2212 exp(\u2212cN \u03b2f 2 /2k)]\n\n(3)\n\nwhere c is a dimensionless constant of the order of 1.\nFor c = 0.75 and N \u2264 1000, this expression (solid\nline in Fig. 3) gives a fair agreement with the computational results. For larger values of N (i.e., when\nhNc /N i becomes very small), the expression tends to\noverestimate the rate of decrease in the mean fraction\nof connected monomers (or, equivalently, the effective\nattachment probability). The decrease in the attachment probability of the motors is another, indirect, manifestation of cooperativity between the motors which is\nmediated through the forces that they jointly exert on\nthe actin track. Eq. (3) suggests that the elasticity of\nthe track can be neglected for small filaments whose size\nN \u226a (\u03b2f 2 /2k)\u22121 \u2261 N \u2217 . In this regime, the two cooperativity effects discussed here which are associated with the\nelasticity of the actin filaments disappear: (i) The drift\nvelocity Vdrift \u223c (\u03b2/2k\u03bb)f 3 = (f /\u03bb)(N \u2217 /N ) \u226a (f /\u03bb) is\nvanishingly smaller than the typical speed by which the\nbidirectionally moving bundle propagates in each direction, and (ii) the fraction of attached motors hNc /N i \u2243 q\nis very close to the attachment probability of individual\nmotors. The elasticity effects can be detected only for\n\u2217\nlong filaments with N >\neffec\u223c N , which are softer (the\ntive force constant of the filament decrease as N \u22121 ) and,\nhence, more influenced by the forces of the motors. For\ninfinitely stiff filaments (k \u2192 \u221e), the crossover filament\nsize diverges (N \u2217 \u2192 \u221e) and the filament elasticity is, of\ncourse, irrelevant on all length scales.\nFigs. 2(A) and (B) represent two limiting cases. In the\nformer, the friction is caused by the drag of the actin\nbundle in the viscous environment, while in the latter it\noriginates from the attachment of the actin to the under-\n\n\f4\nlying surface of motors. The actual friction coefficient is\nexpected to lie between these two extreme values and,\ntherefore, the drift velocity should exhibit an intermediate behavior between those shown in Figs. 2(A) and (B).\nThus, the typical magnitude of Vdrift is expected to be of\nthe order of 10 nm/sec. Interestingly, the drift velocity of\nthe bundle is of the same order of magnitude as its speed\nduring the bidirectional motion [10], which has also been\nfound to be 2-3 order of magnitude smaller than the moving velocity of individual myosin II motors (v \u223c 6 \u03bcm/sec\n[12]). Over a period of a few minutes the a-polar bundle\nmay progress a distance of a few micrometers. This implies that the drift of a-polar bundles may be relevant to\nthe active remodeling of the cell cytoskeleton occurring\nduring many cellular processes.\nOur investigation of the role of the filament elasticity in modifying collective motion of molecular motors\nhas been motivated by experiments which have been described and analyzed by using a ratchet model and a\nmean field approximation for the elastic energy [10, 11].\nIn this paper we presented a more realistic microscopic\nbased model that involves the determination of the exact elastic energy of the filaments. We demonstrated\nthat such a model leads to new insights and novel results like the biased transport of filaments with no net\npolarities. Experimental verification of this surprising\nresult is, however, difficult. It requires that (i) the moving filaments are perfectly a-polar with internal (sequential) order, and (ii) that they move for sufficiently long\nperiod of time such that the net drift can be extracted\nfrom the statistics of the unidirectional intervals of motion. Unfortunately, the a-polar bundles are not formed\nby a well controlled process, but rather through a se-\n\nquence of stochastic fusion events that usually generate\nfilaments with disordered, random, sequences and with\nlittle residual polarities [10]. Also, in the existing experimental setup, the bidirectional motion cannot be tracked\nfor more than about 10 minutes, which is too short for a\nmeaningful statistical analysis. What should be more experimentally testable is the other elasticity effect, namely\nthe reduction in the fraction of connected motors. This\neffect, which has been attributed to the dependence of\nthe elastic energy on the configuration of connected mo~ is not limited to a-polar\ntors (denoted by the vector C),\nfilaments. Polar filaments experiencing a non-uniform\ndistribution of motor forces (i.e., when only a fraction of\nthe monomers are connected to motors) will also develop\na tensile stress that could potentially alter the attachment probability of the motors. In a future publication\nwe plan to present a theoretical analysis of the attachment probability for perfectly polar filaments, similar to\nthe analysis presented here for a-polar filaments. We also\nplan to investigate this effect experimentally by using a\nmotility assay combined with micro-manipulation technique (such as optical tweezers) to stall the gliding filament and measure the mean force generated by the motors. In the case of perfectly polar filaments, the forces of\nall the motors are applied along the same direction and,\ntherefore, the total measured force should be simply proportional to the number of attached motors.\n\n[1] B.
