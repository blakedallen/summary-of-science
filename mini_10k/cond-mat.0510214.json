The scheme allows for efficient computation of thermodynamic properties, including\nwinding numbers and off-diagonal correlations, for systems of much greater size than that accessible\nto conventional PIMC. As an illustrative application of the method, we simulate the superfluid\ntransition of 4 He in two dimensions.\nPACS numbers: 75.10.Jm, 05.30.Jp, 67.40.Kh, 74.25.Dw\n\nOver the past two decades, PIMC simulations have\nplayed a major role in the theoretical investigation of\nquantum many-body systems, not only by providing reliable quantitative results, but also by shaping our current conceptual understanding, e.g., of the relationship\nbetween superfluidity and Bose condensation. At least\nfor Bose systems, PIMC is the only presently known\nmethod capable of furnishing in principle exact numerical\nestimates of physical quantities, including the superfluid\ndensity, and the condensate fraction[1].\nAs PIMC is currently the most realistic option to investigate ever more complex quantum many-body systems, the issue arises of overcoming its present limitations. Aside from the notorious sign problem, the main\nbottleneck of the current PIMC technology is inarguably\nthe maximum system size (i.e., number N of particles) for\nwhich accurate estimates can be obtained, in a reasonable\namount of computer time. Almost two decades since the\npioneering work of Pollock and Ceperley[4], who simulated the superfluid transition in bulk liquid 4 He on a system of N =64 atoms, no further advance has been made,\ndespite a hundredfold increase in computer speed[2].\nFor such quantities as energy and diagonal correlations, one can often approach the thermodynamic limit\n(N \u2192 \u221e), by studying systems comprising as few as \u223c\n30 particles. However, accurate predictions of superfluid\nproperties of liquids (and solids [3]!) require that the\nsuperfluid and condensate fractions, \u03c1S and n\u25e6 , be computed for large systems of significantly different sizes. In\nconventional PIMC, \u03c1S is obtained by means of the socalled winding number estimator[4], which can only take\non a nonzero value if long permutation cycles of identical particles occur in the system. Because the sampling frequency for such cycles decreases exponentially\nwith N , ensuring the ergodicity of the algorithm becomes\nproblematic[5].\nThis hurdle seems difficult to conquer within any\nscheme formulated in the canonical ensemble, in which\nthe winding number is \"topologically locked\" in the\nN \u2192 \u221e limit[1]. On the other hand, the same hur-\n\ndle has been completely overcome in quantum Monte\nCarlo simulations of lattice models. A lattice Path Integral scheme based on an alternative sampling approach,\nknown as worm algorithm (WA) [6], allows for efficient\ncalculations of winding numbers and one-particle Green\nfunction G, for systems of as many as \u223c 106 particles[7].\nA fundamental aspect of the WA is that it operates in an\nextended configurational space, containing both closed\nworld-line configurations (henceforth referred to as Zor diagonal configurations), contributing to the partition\nfunction Z, as well as configurations containing one open\nline (worm). The latter configurations contribute to the\none-particle Green function; below, they are referred to\nas G- (or, off-diagonal) configurations. All topologically\nnon-trivial modifications of world lines occur in the offdiagonal configurational space, where there are no constraints; when the sampling process generates a diagonal\nconfiguration, the number of particles and the winding\nnumber are updated.\nIn this Letter, we describe the extension of the WA\nto the PIMC simulation of quantum many-body systems\nin continuous space. Our novel PIMC implementation,\nwhile based on the same theoretical underpinnings[8], differs fundamentally from the \"canonical\" one[1], both in\nthe configuration space structure, as well as in the sampling method. Since the number of continuous configuration variables is no longer conserved, the new scheme necessarily belongs to the generic domain of diagrammatic\nMonte Carlo methods[9]. As an illustrative application\nof this method, we simulate the superfluid transition in\nliquid 4 He in two dimensions (2D), for systems with up\nto N =2500 particles, i.e. two orders of magnitude larger\nthan in the most recent PIMC study[10]. In particular,\nwe observe a dramatic speed-up in convergence of \u03c1s and\nG.\nWe begin by reviewing conventional PIMC. One obtains averages of physical quantities (at a temperature\nT ) over a set of many-particle configurations {R}, statistically sampled from a probability density proportional\nto \u03c1(R, R, \u03b2) \u2261 hR|e\u2212\u03b2 \u0124 |Ri, where \u03b2 = 1/T (we set\n\n\f2\nkB =1) and \u0124 is the system Hamiltonian. The goal\nis achieved by sampling discrete many-particle paths\nX \u2261 (R1 , R2 , . . . , RP ), periodic in the imaginary time\ninterval \u03b2 = P \u03c4 , from the probability density\n\u03c1(X) = e\u2212U(X)\n\nP\nY\n\n\u03c1\u25e6 (Rj , Rj+1 , \u03c4 )\n\n(1)\n\nj=1\n\nQN\nwhere \u03c1\u25e6 (Rj , Rj+1 , \u03c4 ) = i=1 \u03c1\u25e6 (rij , ri,j+1 , \u03c4 ) is a product of N free-particle propagators, whereas U incorporates correlations, both in space and in imaginary time,\narising from interactions among particles. U is chosen so\nthat, in the \u03c4 \u2192 0 limit, the distribution of configurations R visited by paths X reproduce \u03c1(R, R, \u03b2). Several\nchoices are possible [1] for U , but our algorithm does not\ndepend on its particular form.\nEq. (1) implies the following configuration space structure: N single-particle paths (world lines), labeled i =\n1, 2, . . . , N , propagating in the discretized imaginary time\nt from t1 = 0 to tP +1 = \u03b2. Each world line is formed by\nP successively linked \"beads\" labeled by the number of\nthe corresponding time slices j = 1, 2, . . . , P . The j-th\nbead of the i-th world line is positioned at rij . The \u03b2periodicity implies that the (P +1)-th bead of each world\nline coincides with the first bead of either the same, or\nanother world line.\nThe set of paths {Xl } is sampled by a Metropolis random walk through configuration space. In order to generate Xl+1 from the current path Xl , a local space-time\nmodification of Xl is proposed. The new path X \u22c6 is then\neither accepted, Xl+1 \u2261 X \u22c6 , or rejected, Xl+1 \u2261 Xl ,\nbased on (1), according to the standard procedure [11].\nThe basic update Xl \u2192 X \u22c6 consists of deforming one\nor more randomly selected world lines, over a number\n1\u2264 m \u2264 P of successive links. In order to incorporate\neffects of quantum statistics, it is also crucial to allow\ngroups of 1 < n \u2264 N world lines to exchange: A modified portion of a world line in the group will connect,\nm links later, to a different world line, among the n selected. Note that the number of world lines along X is\nalways equal to N , in this scheme. Updates with arbitrary exchange cycles ensure ergodicity of the algorithm.\nTypically, however, the acceptance rate for permutations\nis frustratingly low, particularly in the presence of repulsive inter-particle potentials (e.g., in condensed helium),\nrendering the calculation inefficient, and impractical for\nlarge N .\nThe WA described here has the same starting point,\nnamely Eq. (1), but with a crucial generalization of\nthe configuration space, which now includes both the\nabove-mentioned diagonal and off-diagonal paths, the\nlatter corresponding to the representation (analogous\nto Eq. (1)) of the one-particle Matsubara Green function G(r, t). Each off-diagonal configuration contains a\nworm, that is, a world line (on a \u03b2-cylinder) with two\nends-the \"head\" and the \"tail\"- corresponding to the\n\nGreen function annihilation and creation operators, respectively. The two special beads at the open world line\nends are named (for historical reasons) Ira (I) and Masha\n(M). Configurations in which I and M are located in\nspace-time at points (rI , tI ) and (rM , tM ) contribute to\nG(rI \u2212 rM , tI \u2212 tM ) with the weight defined in accordance with the generalized Eq. (1).\nThe sampling of paths {Xl } is implemented in WA exclusively through a set of simple, local updates evolving\nI (or, M) in space-time. The particle number becomes\nconfiguration- and time-dependent (there is one less particle between I and M, than in the rest of the path). In\nother words, the WA opens up the possibility to work in\nthe grand canonical ensemble, with the chemical potential \u03bc being an input parameter[12].\nNext, we describe the set of ergodic local updates\nwhich sample our extended configuration space, switching between the Z- and G-sectors. Updates which change\nthe number of continuous variables in X, are arranged in\ncomplementary pairs, satisfying detailed balance. General principles of balancing complimentary pairs can be\nfound in Ref. [9]. We have three pairs: Open/Close, Insert/Remove, and Advance/Recede. Only the Swap update in the list below does not fall in this category, because it preserves the number of variables, i.e., it is selfcomplementary. Naturally, all known standard tricks can\nbe used, in order to enhance performance.\n(1a) Open. This update is only possible if the configuration is diagonal.[13] A world line (say the i-th) and a\nbead (say the j-th) are selected at random. A random\nnumber (m\u22121) of beads, namely j +1, j +2, . . ., j +m\u22121\nare removed, so that a worm appears with I at (rij , tj )\nand M at (ri,j+m , tj+m ). Hence, the difference between\nthe proposed new path, X \u22c6 , and the previous one, X, is\nthat instead of the i-th world line there are now two new\nones: The i-th world line (we retain the same label) now\nends at the j-th bead (I) and the i0 -th world line (we\nintroduce a new label) corresponds to the piece of the\noriginal i-th world line starting from the (j + m)-th bead\n(M). The acceptance probability for this update is\n\u001b\n\u001a\nCNX P m\u0304 e\u2206U\u2212\u03bcm\u03c4\n,\n(2)\nPop = min 1,\n\u03c1\u25e6 (rij , ri,j+m , m\u03c4 )\nwhere \u2206U = U (X) \u2212 U (X \u22c6), NX is the number of world\nlines (particles) in the diagonal configuration X, and an\narbitrary constant C controls the relative statistics of Zand G-sectors. The number m\u0304 < P defines the interval\nfor m: m \u2208 [1, m\u0304]. In practice m\u0304 is adjusted to ensure\nthe desired acceptance rate. Due to the \u03b2-periodicity,\nwithout loss of generality we assume that whenever the\nsituation j + m > P occurs, the enumeration is shifted\nin such a way that j + m \u2264 P , and no ambiguity occurs. These definitions are common to all other moves\ndescribed below, in which m and m\u0304 enter.\n(1b) Close. This update is only possible if the configuration is off-diagonal.[13] Let I be the j-th bead of the\n\n\f3\ni-th worldline and M be the (j + m)-th bead of the i0 -th\nworldline. If m > m\u0304, the move is rejected. If m \u2264 m\u0304, one\nproposes to generate a piece of world line connecting I\nto M, thereby rendering the configuration diagonal. The\ncorresponding spatial positions of new (m \u2212 1) beads,\nri,j+1 , . . . , ri,j+m\u22121 , are sampled\nQm from the product of\nm free-particle propagators \u03bd=1 \u03c1\u25e6 (ri,j+\u03bd\u22121 , ri,j+\u03bd , \u03c4 ).\nThe probability to accept the move is\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u03c1\u25e6 (rij , ri,j+m , m\u03c4 ) e\u2206U+\u03bcm\u03c4\n.\n(3)\nPcl = min 1,\nCNX \u22c6 P m\u0304\nIf the move is accepted, the label i0 is removed.\n(2a) Insert. The other way to create an off-diagonal\nconfiguration from a diagonal one is to seed a new mlink long open world line in vacuum. The number of\nlinks m \u2264 m\u0304 and the position of M in space-time are\nselected at random. The spatial positions of the other m\nbeads are generated from the product of m free-particle\npropagators. The move is accepted with probability\nPin = min{1, CV P m\u0304 e\u2206U+\u03bcm\u03c4 }, where V is the system volume.\n(2b) Remove. The removal of the worm, i.e., the world\nline connecting M to I, is attempted if its length (in the\n\u03b2-periodic sense) is m \u2264 m\u0304. (If m > m\u0304, the proposal is\nrejected [13].) The acceptance probability for the move\nis Prm = min{1, e\u2206U\u2212\u03bcm\u03c4 /CV P m\u0304}. We are in position\nnow to select C. A natural choice would be C = 1/V P m\u0304,\nso that the probability to Open a worm of zero length is\nN/V \u2261 G(0, \u22120).\n(3a) Advance. This move advances I a random number m of slices forward in time. It is similar to Insert\nupdate in implementation. The acceptance probability\nis Pad = min{1, e\u2206U+\u03bcm\u03c4 }. Note that it is possible for I\nto advance past M.\n(3b) Recede. Now I moves backwards in time (in the \u03b2periodic sense) by erasing m consecutive links, the number 1 \u2264 m \u2264 m\u0304 is selected at random. The acceptance\nrate is Pre = min{1, e\u2206U\u2212\u03bcm\u03c4 }. If m turns out to be\nequal or larger than the total number of links between I\nand M along the world line connecting them, the update\nis rejected [13].\n(4) Swap. Let I be positioned on the i-th world line at\nthe j-th time slice. (See Fig. 1.) Consider all the world\nlines intersecting the (j + m\u0304)-th (in the \u03b2-periodic sense)\ntime slice and select one of them (labeled below with k)\nwith the probability Tk = \u03c1\u25e6 (rij , rk,j+m\u0304 , m\u0304\u03c4 )/\u03a3i where\nX\n\u03a3i =\n\u03c1\u25e6 (rij , rl,j+m\u0304 , m\u0304\u03c4 )\n(4)\nl\n\nis the normalization factor (if the selected world line\ncontains M at j \u2032 -th time slice, such that j \u2032 \u2208 [j, j +\nm\u0304], the move is rejected). A set of random positions\nri,j+1 , . . . , ri,j+m\u22121 is then generated as in the Close\nmove, whereas the beads rk,j+1 , . . . , rk,j+m\u22121 are all\nerased. I is shifted to rkj , while the world line i reconnects with the rest of the world line k, which implies\n\nre-labeling, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The move is accepted\nwith probability Psw = min{1, e\u2206U \u03a3i /\u03a3k }.\nThe Swap move generates all possible many-body permutations through a chain of local single-particle updates. Since no two particles need be brought within\na distance of the order of the potential hard core, it enjoys a high acceptance rate, similar to that for the Advance/Recede procedures. It must be emphasized that\nin our algorithm, unlike in conventional PIMC, arbitrary\npermutations of identical particles, as well as macroscopic\nexchange cycles appear automatically, if the physical conditions warrant them. This is because the statistics of the\nrelative positions for the worm ends is given exactly by\nthe Green function G(r, t).\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online). Schematic illustration of Swap move\ndescribed in the text. (a): before the move. (b): after the\nmove.\n\nAs an illustrative application of the new method, we\npresent here simulation results of the superfluid transition in 2D helium. Specifically, we have repeated the\nstudy first carried out in Ref. [14], using the same interatomic potential [15] and at the same 2D density\n\u03c1 = 0.0432 \u00c5\u22122 , but on systems with a number of particles up to hundred times larger. We used an approximation accurate up to \u03c4 4 [16] for the high-temperature density matrix [which determines the structure of the function U (X)], and extrapolated the results to the \u03c4 \u2192 0\nlimit. For a given choice of \u03c4 , the statistical error of \u03c1s\nis comparable to that of the kinetic energy.\nFig. 2 shows our results for the superfluid fraction\n\u03c1S (T ), obtained on systems comprising different numbers N of atoms. Using the procedure illustrated in\nRef. [14], based on Kosterlitz-Thouless theory[17], we\nhave obtained numerical fits to our data, in the critical\ntemperature range 0.65 K \u2264 T \u2264 0.8 K. Our estimates\nfor the values of the fitting parameter are d = 8.8 \u00b1 0.5\n\u00c5 for the vortex core diameter, and E=2.18 \u00b1 0.04 K for\nthe vortex energy, which lead to an estimate for the critical temperature Tc =0.653\u00b10.010 K, significantly different from the previous result, 0.72\u00b10.02 K, deduced from\nthe N = 25 data[14].\nAs mentioned above, our method gives easy access\nto the imaginary-time one-particle Green function, and\n\n\f4\nN =200 and N = 2500 are shown in Fig. 3.\n\n25\n200\n2500\n\n1.0\n\n\u03c1s(\u03a4)\n\n0.8\n\nIn conclusion, we have implemented a novel procedure\nto perform large-scale PIMC simulations. Our scheme extends to continuous space the worm algorithm previously\ndeveloped for lattice systems, and affords efficient computations of thermodynamic properties, including the superfluid density and the single-particle Green function,\nfor system of significantly larger size than accessible to\nthe existing PIMC technology.\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1.0\n\n\u03a4\n\nFIG. 2: Superfluid fraction \u03c1S (T ) computed for 2D 4 He on\nsystems with different numbers N of 4 He atoms.
