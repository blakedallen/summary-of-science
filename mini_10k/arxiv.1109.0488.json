In this\nsituation x is sometimes called an universal element. We refer to [11] for basic facts on\nhypercyclicity.\nRecently there has been interest on a related, more stringent notion. The operator\nT (and likewise the element x \u2208 E) is called frequently hypercyclic if T n x visits any\ngiven neighbourhood with a relatively constant rate. More precisely, given any open\nset U \u2282 E one asks that the set\nA = {n \u2265 1 : T n x \u2208 U}\n\nhas positive density, i.e.\n1\n#(A \u2229 {1, . . . , n}) > 0.\nn\u2192\u221e n\nThis notion was introduced by Bayart and Grivaux [3], [4] and has been studied in many\npapers devoted to operators in Hilbert, Banach, or general topological vector spaces.\nWe refer to [10] and [1] and especially for the references therein for more information\non the known results.\nClassical examples of hypercyclic operators are the translation and differentiation\noperators in the space E of entire functions on the complex plane C, equipped with the\nstandard compact-open topology. We shall consider only the differentiation operator\nlim inf\n\nDate: September 2, 2011.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 47A16, secondary 30D15, 47B38.\nKey words and phrases.

It was during\nthis period that both authors attended a workshop in Functional Analysis sponsored by the University\nof M\u00e1laga [7] where we learned of this interesting problem. The second author was supported by the\nFinnish CoE in Analysis and Dynamics Research, and by the Academy of Finland, projects 113826 &\n118765.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDRASIN AND SAKSMAN\n\nD : E \u2192 E, where Df (z) := f \u2032 (z) (see [1] for results on the translation operator). Let\nus recall that hypercyclicity of D is a classical result due to MacLane [17].\nIn this note we study the following problem: how slowly can a D-frequently hypercyclic entire function grow? This question was raised by Bonillla and Grosse-Erdmann\n[7], and at the same time they gave concrete estimates for the minimal growth of such\na function (it was proven in [8] that indeed D is frequently hypercyclic). In [6] the\nsame authors generalized a well-known result of Godefroy and Shapiro [9] by showing\nthat every operator on E which commutes with D, and is not a multiple of the identity,\nis frequently hypercyclic. A couple of years later Blasco, Bonilla and Grosse-Erdmann\n[1] improved on the earlier results and showed that a D-frequently hypercyclic entire\nfunction f satisfies\nMf (r)\nlim inf 1/4 > 0,\n(1)\nr\u2192\u221e\nr\ni\u03b8\nwhere Mf (r) := sup\u03b8 |f (re )|. Moreover, given any function \u03c6 : R \u2192 [1, \u221e) with\nlimr\u2192\u221e \u03c6(r) = \u221e they proved the existence of a D-frequently hypercyclic entire function f with\n(2)\n\nMf (r) \u2264 er \u03c6(r)\n\nfor r \u2265 1.\n\nThe paper [1] also considered growth in terms of the average Lp -norms. Thus, for\np \u2208 [1, \u221e) and r > 0 let\nZ 2\u03c0\n\u00011/p\n1\nMf,p (r) :=\n|f (rei\u03b8 )|p d\u03b8\n,\n2\u03c0 0\nand augment this with Mf,\u221e (r) = Mf (r). In [1], the authors also showed that, given\na > 0, an inequality\nMf,p (r) \u2264 Ca er r \u2212a\n\ncould only be valid if a \u2264 max(1/2p, 1/4). Moreover, if C is replaced by a factor\n\u03c6(r) \u2191 \u221e, examples with the growth rate a = min(1/2p, 1/4) were constructed.\nQuite recently Bonet and Bonilla [5] constructed almost optimal examples in the\nrange p \u2208 [1, 2) by showing that a = 1/2p can be achieved, again requiring the factor\n\u03c6(r) \u2191 \u221e. Their result is sharp in the special case p = 1.\nOur main result determines the optimal growth rate of entire D-frequently hypercyclic functions. It turns out that the sharp result actually corresponds to the lowest\npossible rates consistent with [1] for all p. Both [1] and [5] employ fairly sophisticated\ntools from the general theory of frequent hypercyclicity. In contrast, our construction\nrelies only on basic complex analysis, elementary heat kernel estimates and on two\nclasses of classical polynomials whose properties reflect the role that p plays in these\nresults. Thus for large p, our construction patches together Rudin-Shapiro polynomials\npm , having coefficients \u00b11, but whose supnorm is minimal; for 1 \u2264 p \u2264 2 an analogous\nrole is played by the de la Vall\u00e9e-Poussin polynomials p\u2217m .\nWe present our main result in three parts, with the most interesting case p = \u221e\nmeriting its own statement.\nTheorem 1.1.\nf such that\n\n(i) For any c > 0 there is an entire frequently hypercyclic function\nMf (r) \u2264 c\n\ner\nr 1/4\n\nfor all r > 0.\n\n\fFREQUENTLY HYPERCYCLIC ENTIRE FUNCTIONS\n\n3\n\nThis estimate is optimal: every such function satisfies lim supr\u2192\u221e r 1/4 e\u2212r Mf (r) > 0.\n(ii) More generally, given c > 0 and p \u2208 (1, \u221e] there is an entire D-frequently\nhypercyclic function f with\nMf,p (r) \u2264 c\n\ner\n\nfor all r > 0,\n\nr a(p)\n\nwhere a(p) = 1/4 for p \u2208 [2, \u221e] and a(p) = 1/(2p) for p \u2208 (1, 2]. This estimate is\noptimal: every such function satisfies lim supr\u2192\u221e r a(p) e\u2212r Mf,p (r) > 0.\n(iii) Given \u03c6(r) \u2191 \u221e, there is an entire D-frequently hypercyclic function f with\nMf,1 (r) \u2264 \u03c6(r)\n\ner\nr 1/2\n\nfor all r > 0.\n\nThis estimate is optimal: every such function satisfies lim supr\u2192\u221e r 1/2 e\u2212r Mf,1 (r) = \u221e.\nThe sharp conclusion (i) provides the converse of (1), yielding a considerable strengthening of the best previously known growth (2). In turn, (ii) sharpens the main result\nof [5] by removing the unnecessary increasing factor \u03c6(r) \u2191 \u221e. Finally, assertion (iii)\nis already due to Bonet and Bonilla [5, Corollary 2.4].\n2.

Long polynomials with controlled norm. Explicit polynomials having a fixed\nproposition of coefficients 1 and with small Lp -norm (up to order of magnitude) will\nbe needed for construction of the blocks Pk f . It is here where the cases 1 \u2264 p \u2264 2 and\np \u2265 2 bifurcate. The first part of the next lemma records the beautiful result of Rudin\nand Shapiro [18] which produces polynomials {pm } of each degree m having coefficients\n\u00b11 and with optimal growth of sup norm (see also [15, \u00a76, Chapter 5 ], [14] and [2] for\nfurther results on unimodular polynomials). That this growth is indeed optimal follows\nimmediately by the Parseval formula. For p \u2208 [1, 2), the {pm } are replaced by the de\nla Vall\u00e9e-Poussin polynomials p\u2217m . Below p\u2032 stands for the exponent conjugate to p.\nLemma 2.1. (i) For each m \u2265 1 there is a trigonometric polynomial pm\npm =\n\nm\u22121\nX\n\nbm,k eik\u03b8 ,\n\nk=0\n\nwhere bm,k = \u00b11 for all 0 \u2264 k \u2264 m \u2212 1, with at least half of the coefficients of f being\n+1, and with\n\u221a\nkpm kp \u2264 5 m for p \u2208 [2, \u221e].\n(ii) Corresponding to each m \u2265 1 is a polynomial\np\u2217m\n\n=\n\nm\u22121\nX\n\nb\u2217m,k eik\u03b8 ,\n\nk=0\n\nwhere |bm,k | \u2264 1 for all 0 \u2264 k \u2264 m \u2212 1, and with at least \u230am/4\u230b coefficients being +1,\nand with\n\u2032\nkp\u2217m kp \u2264 3m(1/p ) for p \u2208 [1, 2].\nProof.\nIn case p = \u221e assertion (i) just records the main result of [18]. Since kpm k2 =\n\u221a\nm, the claim for exponents p \u2208 (2, \u221e) is immediate. In turn, for assertion (ii) we may\nassume that m \u2265 4. Set k = \u230am/4\u230b and choose let p\u2217m (ei\u03b8 ) = e2ki\u03b8 (2F2k (ei\u03b8 ) \u2212 Fk (ei\u03b8 )),\nwhere Fk is the k:th Fejer kernel. In other words, p\u2217m corresponds to a shifted de la\nValle Poussin kernel [15, p.16]. Then kp\u2217m k1 \u2264 3 and the statement for p \u2208 (1, 2] is\nobtained \u221a\nby interpolating (i.e. applying H\u00f6lder's inequality) with the obvious estimate\nkp\u2217m k2 \u2264 m.\n\u0003\n2.2.

We start by recalling [13, p.76] that for any entire function g, the p-means\nlog(Mg,p (r)), p > 0 are increasing, convex functions of log r (alternatively, in our range\np \u2208 [1, \u221e] this is just Hadamard's three circles theorem combined with a simple duality\nargument).

Hence by choosing \u03b1k\nlarge enough we may decrease the Lp -norm of the first factor to compensate for the\npossibly increasing size of qek . However, this does not work for p = 1 since obviously\nthe L1 -norm of any polynomial must exceed the sup-norm of its coefficients!\nHowever, a small change in the argument produces the optimal result also in the case\np = 1 (and hence provides an alternative proof of part (iii) of Theorem 1.1). Assume\nthat we are given an increasing function \u03c6(r) : (0, \u221e) \u2192 [1, \u221e) with limr\u2192\u221e \u03c6(r) = \u221e.\nOne constructs f as before in case p \u2208 (1, 2), the only change is that initially in\nthe definition of the sequence (\u03b1k ) one replaces condition (5) by the single demand\n\n\fFREQUENTLY HYPERCYCLIC ENTIRE FUNCTIONS\n\n\u03b1k \u2265 2dk + 8lk .

A fortiori, there is a constant c1 > 0 such that for\ninfinitely many n \u2265 1\n\u0001\n(19)\n# H \u2229 {n2 , n2 + 1, . . . , n2 + 2n} \u2265 c1 n.\nNext, write down an analogue of the identity (12)\n2\n\n(20)\n\n(n2 )n\n|f (n e )| =\n(n2 )!\n2 i\u03b8\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03bbn,k an2 +k eik\u03b8 ,\n\nk=\u2212n2\n\nwhere one has extended in a natural way definition (13) of \u03bbn,k to all values k \u2265 \u2212n2 .\nObserve that the estimates (14) and (15) show that \u03bbn,k \u2265 c2 for k = 0, . . . 2n, where c2\nis independent of n. Hence, for p > 1 the optimality follows simply by considering (20)\nfor arbitrarily\nn that satisfy (19), applying Stirling's formula, and the standard\nP\u221elarge ik\u03b8\nestimate k \u2212\u221e bk e kp \u2265 k(bk )\u221e\nk=\u2212\u221e klmax(p\u2032 ,2) , obtained from the Hausdorff-Young inequality see [16]). In case p = 1 one approximates similarly any given constant A\n(instead of just A = 1) and obtains that lim supr\u2192\u221e Mf,1 (r)r 1/2 e\u2212r \u2265 cA. Since A > 1\nis arbitrary, the necessity of the increasing factor \u03c6(r) in case (iii) of Theorem 1.1\nfollows.\nRemark 4.3. By employing the identity (20) exactly as in the previous remark, and\nby recalling that each set Ak contains an arithmetic sequence of indices (it enough to\nconsider just any single Ak with qk 6= 0), one checks that for p \u2208 (1, \u221e] our function f\nverifies the lower bound\n(21)\n\nMf,p (r) \u2265 e\ncer r \u2212 max(1/2p,1/4)\n\nfor r > 1,\n\nwhere e\nc is a positive constant. Hence one has Mf,p (r) \u224d er r \u2212 max(1/2p,1/4) for all r > 1.\nHowever, in general a frequently hypercyclic function f needs not satisfy (21), since\none could easily modify our construction to impose infinitely many large (dyadic) gaps\nto the Taylor series of f .\n\n\f12\n\nDRASIN AND SAKSMAN\n\nRemark 4.4. A main ingredient in our construction is the selection of the right size for\nthe blocks Pn f . This is actually rather delicate issue: if the blocks are suitably sparse,\none obtains that the blocks Pn f are independent in the sense of Proposition 3.3. This\ncan be most easily understood by comparing the growth of a single term inside the\nblock with the exponential growth. Indeed, the ratio r n e\u2212r takes\n\u221a its maximal value at\n|z| = n and starts to decay rapidly as soon as |z \u2212 n| >> n (or, equivalently, \u03bbn,k\nin (13) decreases quickly for k >> n). This suggests that the block structure should\nbe at least as sparse as in (3), which choice also enables one to make full advantage\nof the use of Lemma 2.1. On the other hand, if the the blocks were more sparse, the\napplication of Hadamard's three circles theorem in Proposition 3.3 would be defective.\nAll said, for our proof the choice in (3) is essentially unique.\nRemark 4.5. The question of the minimal growth of D-hypercyclic entire functions\nis considerably easier since then there is no need to try to build in cancellation. The\nsharp result [19], [12]\u221asays that any D-frequently hypercyclic entire function satisfies\nlim supr\u2192\u221e Mf (r)e\u2212r r = \u221e and this result is optimal.\nReferences\n[1] O.
