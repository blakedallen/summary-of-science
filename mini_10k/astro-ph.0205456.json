I review the current status of deep, wide-field VLBI continuum surveys. I also discuss anticipated short and long-term improvements\nin sensitivity (e.g. the eEVN), and the science these developments will\nenable.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the last few years, great strides have been made towards understanding the\nnature of the faint sub-mJy and microJy radio source population. Most of these\nstudies have employed connected arrays, such as the VLA e.g. Richards et al.\n1998, Richards 2000; MERLIN e.g. Muxlow et al. 1999; ATCA e.g. Norris\net al. 2001 and the WSRT e.g. Garrett et al. 2001). These observations\ntypically integrate for many days on relatively small patches of sky, targeting\nwell known \"deep field\" regions, rich in complimentary observations at sub-mm,\nmid-IR, near-IR, optical and x-ray wavelengths. Such radio observations reach\nr.m.s. noise levels \u223c few microJy/beam, encountering source densities of \u223c 1\nper square arcmin at 1.4 GHz.\nUntil recently the idea that VLBI observations could detect even one solitary, compact radio source in these narrow, radio-quiet, deep field regions would\nhave been tantamount to a declaration of professional suicide. However, such observations are now possible due to: (i) increasing individual telescope sensitivity\ncoupled with sustained, high data rate recording systems, (ii) the simultaneous\nemployment of both phase-referencing and wide-field imaging techniques, and\n(iii) the availability of more capable correlators, matched by equally impressive\ndesktop data analysis facilities.\nIn this paper I will review the current status of deep, wide-field, VLBI\ncontinuum imaging - focusing on the technique and the science it enables. I\nwill also look forward to future developments (e.g. eEVN) \u2013 these promise to\ncompletely transform our current capabilities, in a way that will open-up entirely\nnew areas of VLBI research. But first I begin with a summary of the properties\nof the faint, sub-mJy and microJy radio sky.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nM.A. Garrett\n\nFigure 1.\nA deep WSRT 1.4 GHz radio contour map superimposed\nupon a CFHT optical image (Barger et al. 1998) of the Hubble Deep\nField and Flanking Field region. Mid-IR 15\u03bcm ISO sources (> 4\u03c3\ndetections that coincide with WSRT radio sources) are represented by\nopen hexagonal symbols. The ISO observations (Aussel et al. 1999)\nonly cover the inner part of the full WSRT field of view, nevertheless\nthe correlation between ISO and WSRT radio sources is striking.\n\n2.\n\nFaint Radio Sources\n\nFig. 1 presents a deep 1.4 GHz WSRT image (Garrett et al. 2000a) of the\nHubble Deep Field (HDF \u2013 Williams et al. 1996). One of the simplest but\nmost striking observations is the close correspondence between faint WSRT 1.4\nGHz detections and ISO 15\u03bcm detections. In particular, the vast majority of\nthese distant sources that are common to both the WSRT and ISO appear to\nfollow the well-known FIR-radio correlation (Garrett 2002). This FIR-radio\n\n\fDeep, Wide\u2013field VLBI Continuum Imaging\n\n3\n\ncorrelation was first observed with respect to \"normal\" star-forming galaxies\nin the local Universe (e.g. Condon 1992). Its extension to these much more\nluminous and more distant systems in the HDF (the WSRT/ISO sample has a\nmedian redshift of 0.7) is convincing evidence that the majority of the faint radio\nsource population are identified as star forming galaxies with Star Formation\nRates (SFR) often well in excess of 100 M\u2299 /yr. This observation (see Fig. 2) is\nbacked up (Richards et al. 1998, Muxlow et al. 1999) by the measured angular\nsize of the radio sources, their radio morphology/steep radio spectra, and their\noptical morphology (the latter often showing evidence for galaxy interactions).\n\n00\n11\n11\n00\n00\n11\n\nARP 220\n11\n00\n00\n11\n\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0 1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0 1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n00\n11\n0\n1\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n11\n00\n11 11\n00\n00\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n11\n00\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n0\n1\n00\n11\n0\n1\n00\n11\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1 1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n01\n1\n\n00\n11\n11\n00\n00\n11\n\n11\n00\n00\n11\n00\n11\n11\n00\n00\n11\n\nNearby Galaxies\nHDF WSRT/ISO Galaxies\n\nFigure 2.\nA logarithmic plot of the FIR vs Radio Luminosity for local\ngalaxies (Condon 1992) with the addition of the ISO/WSRT extension\nto fainter but higher luminosity/higher redshift sources shown by the\nlarger filled circles (Garrett 2002). The additional ISO/WSRT sample\ncovers a range of redshift, up to z \u223c 1.3. The most luminous sources\nare also the most distant, with implied SFRs an order of magnitude\ngreater than Arp 220.\nA picture is thus developing of a radio sky that literally \"lights up\" at\nmicroJy flux density levels, with the bulk of the radio emission being directly\nrelated to massive star-formation i.e. supernovae events and the global acceleration of cosmic ray electrons via propagating shocks that are associated with\nthese events. Note, however, that these conclusions are dominated by the faintest\n(and most numerous) microJy radio sources, in particular the AGN fraction is\nobserved to increase rapidly at higher (sub-mJy) flux density limits. In addition, there is a significant fraction of these faint radio sources for which little\n\n\f4\n\nM.A. Garrett\n\nis known, these are the optically faint radio source population \u2013 believed to be\nhigh redshift galaxies in which the dust content is large enough to completely\nobscure the IR, optical, uv and even soft x-ray emission. There seems to be a\ncorrespondence between this population and the faint SCUBA source population (e.g. Hughes et al. 1998). The latter are now considered to be responsible\nfor the vast bulk of the star formation in the early Universe but their detailed\nproperties remain largely unknown. In particular, it is unclear whether the radio\nand FIR emission arise via AGN, star formation activity or some combination\nof both phenomena.\nPLot file version 3 created 15-OCT-2001 16:35:49\nCONT: HDF IPOL 1653.990 MHZ HDF NA CLN.ICL001.1\n62 11 33.22\n\n33.20\n\n33.18\n\nDECLINATION (J2000)\n\n33.16\n\n33.14\n\n33.12\n\n33.10\n\n33.08\n\n33.06\n\n33.04\n\n33.02\n12 36 44.398 44.39644.39444.39244.39044.38844.38644.38444.382\nRIGHT ASCENSION (J2000)\nCont peak flux = 3.1686E-04 JY/BEAM\nLevs = 3.000E-05 * (-3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)\n\nCONT: HDF IPOL 1653.990 MHZ HDF NA CLN.ICL002.1\n\nDECLINATION (J2000)\n\n62 13 31.50\n\n31.45\n\n31.40\n\n31.35\n\n12 36 42.10\n42.09\n42.08\nRIGHT ASCENSION (J2000)\nCont peak flux = 2.1953E-04 JY/BEAM\nLevs = 3.000E-05 * (-3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)\n\nCONT: HDF IPOL 1653.990 MHZ HDF NA CLN.ICL003.1\n62 14 04.78\n04.76\n\nDECLINATION (J2000)\n\n04.74\n04.72\n04.70\n04.68\n04.66\n04.64\n04.62\n04.60\n\n12 36 46.34\n46.33\nRIGHT ASCENSION (J2000)\nCont peak flux = 1.5930E-04 JY/BEAM\nLevs = 3.000E-05 * (-3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)\n\n46.32\n\nFigure 3.\nEVN detections in the HDF: the distant z=1.01 FRI (top),\nthe z=4.4 dusty obscured starburst hosting a hidden AGN (middle)\nand the z=0.96 AGN (bottom).

A taste of what may be possible is provided by the recent EVN\nobservations of the Hubble Deep Field.\n\n3.1.\n\nDeep Field VLBI observations of the HDF\n\nOn 12-14 November 1999 the EVN conducted the first pilot VLBI \"blank field\"\nobservations of the radio sky. The field chosen was the HDF-N \u2013 an area that\nis just about as empty and undistinguished as the radio sky gets. The brightest\nsource in the \u223c 2 arcminute radial field of view was an FR-I radio galaxy with\na total WSRT 1.4 GHz flux density of \u223c 1.6 mJy.\nThe data were recorded at a rate of 256 Mbits/sec for 32 hours \u2013 a sustained\ncapability that is unique to the EVN (and has recently been extended to 512\nMbits/sec). Observing in external phase-reference mode, a total of \u223c 14 hours\nof \"on-source\" data were collected. With a resolving beam area 1 million times\nsmaller than the WSRT HDF-N observations, the EVN surveyed an area of about\n12 square arcminutes. Six HDF-N radio sources were thus targeted simultaneously (using wide-field imaging techniques \u2013 see Garrett et al. 1999). The final\nnaturally weighted images have an r.m.s. noise level of \u223c 33 \u03bcJy/beam \u2013 much\nlarger than that expected from thermal noise considerations (\u223c 11 \u03bcJy/beam).\nThe images are probably limited by the inclusion of poorly calibrated or completely corrupt data - difficult to identify in this case, and not uncommon with\nexternal phase-calibration during observations made at solar maximum.\nNevertheless, the EVN simultaneously detected three radio sources above\nthe 165 \u03bcJy (\u223c 5\u03c3) limit, in the inner part of HDF-N region (see Fig 3). These\ninclude: VLA J123644+621133 (a z = 1.013, low-luminosity and extremely\ndistant FR-I radio source which is resolved by the EVN into a core plus hot-spots,\nthe latter being associated with the larger scale radio jet), VLA J123642+621331\n(a dust enshrouded, optically faint \u2013 I < 25m , z = 4.424 starburst system \u2013\nWaddington et al. 1999) and the faintest detection, VLA J123646+621404 (a\nface-on spiral galaxy at z = 0.96 with a total EVN flux density of 180 \u03bcJy/beam).\nThe diversity of optical type is interesting but the real surprise is the detection of a radio-loud AGN in the dust obscured, z = 4.4, starburst system. This\nargues that at least some fraction of the optically faint radio source population\nharbour hidden AGN (this may be similar to the same obscured population detected by Chandra). These AGN powered systems might be quite difficult to\ndetect with SCUBA, if the dust temperatures are higher than that associated\nwith pure star forming systems. In any case, the detection of this system highlights the use of VLBI as a powerful diagnostic \u2013 able to distinguish in principle\n\n\f6\n\nM.A. Garrett\n\n(via brightness temperature arguments) between radio emission generated by\nnuclear starbursts and AGN.\n\nSRT\nPRIMARY\nBEAM\n\nTARGETS\n\nFAINT\nCALIBRATOR\n\nFigure 4.\nThe SRT 64-m primary beam at L-band, superimposed\nupon the crowded WSRT 1.4 GHz image of the HDF region.

The faint, \"inbeam\" calibrator that permits accurate and continuous phase calibration to be applied to the other target sources is also shown.\n\n4.\n\nFuture Prospects for Deep Field VLBI Studies\n\nThe EVN observations of the HDF suggest that deep, wide-field VLBI studies\nare not only possible, but in principle they can deliver important astronomical\nresults. So far we have only scratched the surface. In a sense, we are just\nbeginning to appreciate the fact, that VLBI has reached a sensitivity level where\nwe can expect to detect many discrete radio sources in a single field of view\n(irrespective of where you point the telescopes!). This is quite a departure from\nthe traditional VLBI \"postage stamp\" approach of observing specific, singular\n\n\fDeep, Wide\u2013field VLBI Continuum Imaging\n\n7\n\ntargets, often chosen from flux limited catalogues of the very brightest and most\ncompact radio sources in the sky.\n4.1.\n\nShort-term developments\n\nIn the short-term continuum VLBI sensitivity is set to continue its steady improvement \u2013 three new telescopes are expected to come on-line (including the 64m Sardinia Radio Telescope, see Grueff these proceedings) and various upgrades\nare already well advanced (e.g. the replacement of the surface of the Lovell\n76-m). Recent EVN test observations have demonstrated that the new 2-head,\n512 Mbit/sec data recording system can reach thermally limited r.m.s. noise\nlevels of \u223c 20 microJy/beam with (on-source) integration times of only \u223c 2.5\nhours. There is every reason to believe that much longer observations employing\n\"in-beam\" phase-calibration techniques (rather than external phase-calibration)\ncan also attain thermally limited noise levels. For example, currently a 24 hour\nobservation of a carefully selected deep field should attain a r.m.s. noise level\nof \u223c 7 microJy/beam. Similar noise levels can be achieved with a global VLBI\narray. At these sort of flux density levels, the radio sky becomes so crowded\nthat it makes sense to image out a large fraction of the primary beam of the\nlargest individual antennas in the array. The anticipated introduction of extremely fine spectral resolution and sub-second integration times at the EVN\nData Processor at JIVE, will make it possible to do just this. Dozens of faint\nsub-mJy and microJy radio sources will thus be simultaneously targeted and\nimaged with milliarcsecond resolution, full uv-coverage and microJy sensitivity.\nThe \"postage stamp\" era of VLBI will thus be consigned to the astronomical\ndust bin, and with it, the current limitations of VLBI to conduct unbiased,\ngeneral sky surveys. Fig. 4 highlights the type of VLBI, deep field observing\nphilosophy that might be employed. The \"in-beam\" calibrator is chosen to be\nbright enough to provide adequate SNR in the phase solutions but not so bright\nas to impose dynamic range limitations on the surrounding field (see Garrett\n2000b for a more detailed explanation).\n4.2.\n\nLonger-term expectations\n\nPC disk-based \"recording\" systems (e.g. MkV, Whitney 2001 and PC-EVN,\nParsley 2001) are expected to replace the aging MkIV and VLBA tape recorders\nover the next few years. Initially they provide the same level of economy, capacity and recording data rates as current tape based systems but with a much\nreduced level of maintenance and a much higher level of reliability. In addition,\nthe capacity of these disk-based systems is also expected to increase rapidly, as\nthey take advantage of the continuing commercial development of PCs and their\nperipheral storage devices. Commercially operated optical fibre networks also\nappear capable of distributing VLBI data from telescopes to a central correlator in real-time. Tests are already being conducted, both within Europe, the\n\n\f8\n\nM.A. Garrett\n\nFigure 5.\nLeft: The current uv-coverage of the EVN at \u03bb6 cm for\na source located at \u03b4 = 30\u25e6 . Right: the extended (almost full) uvcoverage of the eEVN for the same source, assuming a total bandwidth\nof 2 GHz per polarisation.\nUS and between the two continents (see Schilizzi these proceedings & Schilizzi\n2002). In any case, the expectation is that VLBI will be able to utilise several\nGHz of bandwidth on the same time-scale as the EVLA and e-MERLIN begin\noperation i.e. before the end of the current decade. Employing several GHz of\nbandwidth has of course implications down the line: a more capable correlator\nwill be required, perhaps not very different to the system now being designed\nfor the EVLA and e-MERLIN. VLBI data acquisition electronics will also need\nto be completely redesigned, and broad-band receivers must be introduced at\ntelescopes across the network. A new instrument will thus emerge (currently\ndubbed eEVN) that will deliver substantial benefits: sub-microJy noise levels\nand almost full uv-coverage at \u03bb6 cm (see Fig. 5).\n4.3.\n\nNew Deep Field VLBI Science\n\nAt these sub-microJy noise levels, it should be possible to begin to detect not\nonly traditional VLBI targets such as low-luminosity AGN, SN (SNR) etc., but\nalso cosmologically distant, nuclear starburst galaxies, such as those now observed (but typically not well resolved) by connected arrays in the Hubble Deep\nField. Fig. 6 shows how the radio and sub-mm flux density of Arp 220 changes\nwith redshift. In nuclear starbursts (such as Arp 220) a large fraction of the radio emission is contained within a region of intense star formation, usually less\nthan a kpc across. At cosmological distances 1 kpc corresponds to an angular\ndiameter of \u223c 0.1 arcsecond on the sky, a scale size that is ideally suited to a\ncombined eEVN and e-MERLIN array.\nWith a star formation rate (SFR) of \u223c 100 M\u2299 /yr, Fig. 6 shows that Arp\n220 could in principle be detected by the eEVN out to cosmologically interesting\n\n\fDeep, Wide\u2013field VLBI Continuum Imaging\n\n9\n\nZ = 0.018\n\nZ = 0.5\nZ=2\n\nFigure 6.\nThe SED of Arp 220 as observed and then projected (\u03a9m =\n0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, H0 = 70 km/sec/Mpc) to z=0.5 and z=2.\nredshifts. Since many of the galaxies in the HDF have inferred SFR that are\nmore than an order of magnitude larger than Arp 220, the radio structure of\ngalaxies at even earlier epochs may be probed. It is not clear what to expect but\nthe view is expected to be dramatic, as massive star formation (and its violent\n\"radio loud\" aftermath \u2013 SN, SNR and GRBs) rampages unchecked through\nstill-forming galaxies. A detailed study of the radio structure of such distant\nsystems will probably require the nanoJy sensitivity of a high resolution, next\ngeneration radio instrument, such as the Square Km Array (SKA). Deep radio\ncontinuum images can tell us how star formation is distributed through a given\nsystem, providing clues to the nature of the galaxy formation process itself and\nthe importance of galaxy interactions and mergers, not to mention the interrelationship between AGN activity and star formation. But in the meantime,\nthe eEVN with baselines on the scale of several thousand km, GHz of bandwidth,\n\"fantastic\" input and output data rates, and of course microJy sensitivity, can\nmake a useful start in this area. The eEVN will also form a natural test-bed for\nthe SKA, encountering many of the same problems and initial limitations. The\nnext few years promise to be exciting and challenging, for radio astronomy in\ngeneral but VLBI in particular.\nAcknowledgments.
