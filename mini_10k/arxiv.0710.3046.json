The paper\npresents a workflow for an automated characterization of the\ntopology of the void space, using a partition of the void\nspace into polyhedral cells connected by windows. This\ncharacterization serves as the basic input for the Edwards\nentropic formalism that deals with the statistical\ncharacterization of configurational disorder in granular\naggregates and argued to work for foams. The Edwards\nformalism is introduced and simplified expectation-values\nare calculated.\nINTRODUCTION\nFoams and granular media have mutual properties. Both\nhave disordered structure, for both the void space is as\nimportant as the material and for both the characterization of\nthe structure is a key to the understanding and prediction of\nphysical properties, such as permeability and thermal or\nelectrical conductivity. These similarities suggest that a\nunified formalism should be found to treat the structure and\nproperties of these systems. Such formalism is found in a\npaper by Edwards and Oakeshott [1] that conjectured that\ngranular materials can be treated via an entropic formalism,\nwhich is similar to statistical mechanics, provided that the\nenergy of the system is replaced by its volume. The key to\nthe application of the formalism is the description of the\nstates of the system by a set of parameters called the degrees\nof freedom.\nIn this paper we present the first few steps in the\nunification of foams and granular aggregates. We start by\nthe transformation of foam to a structure composed of\npseudo-grains. Next an automated method is described to\nidentify the cellular structure. The cellular structure is used\nto extract topological data such as the number of windows\nper cell. Last, we show for a simplified 2D structure how to\nuse the Edwards formalism to obtain expectation values.\nHowever, to put everything in context we start with a short\nintroduction to the Edwards Formalism.\nEDWARDS' COMPACTIVITY\nThe statistical mechanical formalism of Edwards is based\non the replacement of the energy of thermodynamic systems\n\nby volume and of temperature by an analogue quantity \u2013\ncompactivity [1, 2]. In this approach the system is assumed\nto have a very large set of possible 'states', where each state\nrepresents a possible configuration of the system\ncomponents. For grains a state is defined by the position of\ngrains, orientation, shape etc. For foam a state is defined by\nthe cellular structure, the connectivity of cells etc. These\nparameters are called the degrees of freedom because their\ndistribution determines the possible states. Each state has a\nprobability of occurrence that depends on the system's\nvolume V and states with identical volume are assumed to\nhave equal probabilities of occurrence. The probability\nfactor is given by the modified Boltzmann factor\nexp(\u2212 V X ) where the parameter X was named as the\nCompactivity. Since the phase space of the system's states is\ncontinuous, the configuration of parameters is accompanied\nby a density of states \u0398({q}) , which counts the number of\nstates in the differential volume around the configuration of\nparameters {q} . The density of states also throws nonphysical and non-available states.\nThe partition function is an non-normalized integral over\nthe probabilities of all possible states of the system, which\nare expressed by the set of parameters {q} ,\n\nZ = \u222b e \u2212W ({q}) / x \u0398({q})\u03a0 dq .\n\n(1)\n\nIn eq. (1), W is the volume function that gives the volume of\nthe entire system in terms of all the independent parameters\nin the system {q} . The entropy is defined as the log of the\nnumber of states at given volume. In terms of the entropy,\nthe compactivity is defined as X = \u2202W \u2202S ; in a similar\nmanner to the way temperature is defined in statistical\nmechanics, T = \u2202H \u2202S . This simple approach makes it\npossible to calculate structural properties as expectation\nvalues by plugging the property into the partition function.\nFor example, in consolidated materials made of grains, the\nvolume associated with one grain is\n\nVg =\n\n1\nVg ({q})e \u2212W ({q}) /( \u03bbx ) \u0398({q})\u03a0 dq .\n\u222b\nZ\n\n(2)\n\nThe Edwards conjecture has been investigated and\nexperiments suggest that it works for granular materials\n[3,4]. While this theory has been proposed for rigid particle\nseveral works argue its suitability to foams [4,5]. If this is\n\n\findeed the case this theory gives us, for the first time, a\ncomplete formalism that predicts properties of both\ndisordered foams and granular materials.\nIn order to check and use the Edwards compactivity we\nmust find first a set of parameters that describe correctly the\nsystem. The set of parameters must span the phase space of\nall possible configurations. It should have the correct\nnumber of parameters and should parameterize the volume\nfunction so W is written as a function of these properties.\nIn several recent publications [2,5] it was argued that a\npreferred set of such parameters is given by quadrons [5].\nThese are quadrilaterals in 2D and octahedra in 3D that are\nassociated with cells and grains (or foam vertices). The\nconstruction of quadrons is based on the identification of the\ncontacts between grains (or between vertices for foam) and\nidentification of the cellular structure of the porous material.\nHere we propose to use the contact network to build a fully\nautomatic method to obtain the cellular structure; to obtain\nthe properties of the porous system; and to produce the\nquadrons. The coordination number, ZV , of a basic element\n(vertex of foam or grain) is given by the number of contacts\nbetween the element and its nearest neighbors. For clarity\nand simplicity we will consider here the special case of\nZV = 4 . Such systems include open and closed cell foams\nand general tetrahedral systems as silicates and dense\ncolloidal aggregates.\nCHARACTERIZATION\nThe characterization is based on the partition of the void\nspace into cells that are connected to each other via\nwindows. The system is simplified into a polyhedral\nstructure that captures the correct connectivity of both the\nlamella of the foam (or grains) and of the void space. To\nrepresent the system as such we need first to identify the\nplateau borders and vertices of the foam. There are various\nmethods to do that [6,7] using geometrical methods, such as\nthose that are based on the maximal ball algorithm [6,8] and\ntopological methods as those based on the medial axis\nalgorithm [7]. The maximal ball method assumes that pores\nare locally the widest parts of the system that are linked via\nnarrow tube like throats. The algorithm and its successors\nare designed for low porosity and thus are ideal for the\nidentification of the vertices and plateau borders. For foam\nthe algorithm acts upon the lamella of the foam in which we\nthe pores represent the vertices and throats represent the\nplateau borders. While this method is applicable to general\nstructures, in what follows we concentrate on ZV = 3 in 2D\nand ZV = 4 foam in 3D. We also assume that the vertices\nand plateau borders have been properly identified.\nConsider a Zv=4 foam. The first stage of the\ncharacterization unifies the description of foam with the\ndescription of granular tetrahedral systems. Each vertex of\nthe foam is transformed into a tetrahedron simply by\nconnecting the middle of its four plateau borders to each\nother to form a pyramid (Figure 1). The tetrahedra touch\n\ntheir neighbors at the corners. Thus the corners are the\ncontact points. Topologically, the foam and the dual\ntetrahedral-structure are homeomorphic. I.e., the\nconnectivity of the two structures and of their void spaces\nare identical. In similar manner, the vertices of 2D foams are\ntransformed into triangles by connecting the middle of the\nfoam's ligaments.\n\nFigure 1. Left: The Plateau borders and vertices of 3D foam.\nMiddle: Transformation of vertices to tetrahedra by\nconnection of the middle of the plateau borders. Right: The\ndual tetrahedral network.\nWe continue with the definition of cells and windows.\nCells are simply connected polyhedra (Fig 2). The cell\nboundary is composed of a set of facets of tetrahedra and of\nthe windows associated with this set. The set of facets is\nclosed. I.e. at all corners of each facet in the set there is a\ntouching facet that belongs to the set. For a cell there can be\nonly one facet per tetrahedron and each facet belongs to one\ncell. Thus there are exactly four cells around each of the\ntetrahedra. The cell defined by the faces is open and\nconnected to its neighboring cells via the openings between\nthe faces. Windows are these openings.\n\nFigure 2. A typical cell. Its boundary is composed of a\nclosed set of triangular facets of tetrahedra and windows that\nconnect cells (transparent skewed polygons).\nWindows are skewed polygons. Once the set of faces is\nknown, the windows are identified by placing normal\nvectors, directed outwards, on each of the faces and ordering\nvectors around each face in the positive direction of rotation\n(Fig 3). Windows boundaries are identified by following the\nsame vectors in the negative direction of rotation.\nThus we are left with the task of identifying the set of faces\nthat belongs to a cell. In order to obtain the cellular structure\nwe use a different set of algorithms from the one used for the\nlamella, because the maximal ball algorithm has been\ndesigned for low porosity. For foam the porosity is very high\nand the throats have degenerated from tube like structures to\nsimply connected surfaces (i.e. windows). The algorithm\n\n\fused inflates a deformable balloon from the middle of a\nfacet into the cell while keeping the balloon's curvature\npositive everywhere and at all times. This ensures that the\nexpansion process stops once the balloon starts exiting the\npore via the narrower throats (Figure 4).\n\nB\n\nA\n\nC\n\nMono-dispersed foam\n\n9\n\n3\n\nFREQUENCY\n\n2000\n1500\n1000\n500\n\n200\n\n0.001 0.003 0.005 0.007\n\n0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04\n\nTHROAT AREA\n\nFREQUENCY\n\n0\n\nCELL VOLUME\n\n40\n20\n0\n11 15 19 23 27 31 35 39 43\n\nFACETS PER CELL\n\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n34\n\n60\n\n18\n\nTHROAT PER CELL\nFREQUENCY\n\n80\n\n8\n\nTHROATS PER\nCELL\n\n16\n\n25\n\n22\n\n19\n\n16\n\n13\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n0.008\n\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n\n18\n\n40\n\nFREQUENCY\n\n80\n60\n\n0.004\n\nCELL VOLUME\n\n30\n\n0\n\n14\n\n50\n\n12\n\n100\n\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n\n26\n\n150\n\n22\n\n200\n\n7\n\n8\n\n400\n\n0\n0.\n02\n0.\n04\n0.\n06\n0.\n08\n\nFREQUENCY\n\n7\n\n600\n\nTHROAT AREA\n\nFREQUENCY .\n\n6\n\n0\n0\n\nFREQUENCY\n\nAs an example two samples were created, a 3D Voronoi\ntessellation made from Poisson distribution of seeding points\n[9] and foam \u2013 produced by the surface evolver [10].

Right\nVoronoi tessellation, Left side: Mono-dispersed foam\n\n\fWhile the topological properties of the foam structure,\nsuch as the number of throats per cell, can be extracted\ndirectly form the tetrahedral structure, the geometrical\nproperties are only estimated. For example, knowing the\ntetrahedra that form a throat the original throat area can be\nextracted by introducing it to the maximal ball algorithm.\nThe maximal ball algorithm extracts the plateau borders that\ncorrespond to these tetrahedra and the throat area can be\nextracted by the projection of the plateau borders onto the\nplain that is normal to the vector connecting the center of the\ntwo cells. In similar manners properties such as cell volume,\nsurface area and the minimal cross section of contacts\nbetween grains can be extracted. However, we will leave\nthose to a different publication due to the limited space here.\nLast, the characterization above can be used to describe\nthe basic structure found in the Edwards formalism. Due to\nlack of space this is done here only for a 2D system. For 2D\nfoam vertices are replace by triangles (Fig. 7A). The\nparameters that describe the system are extracted for the\ndivision of the volume into quadrilaterals (Fig. 7B), termed\nquadrons [5]. For each edge between triangle t and cell c\nconnect its edges to the centre of the triangle and centre of\ncell. These quadrilaterals tessellate space and\nthus W = \u2211Vquadron , where Vquadron is the volume of a\nquadron. Moreover, the number of quadrilaterals was shown\nto be equal to the number of degrees of freedom of the\nsystem. Thus, these volumes can serve as the degrees of\nfreedom. Assuming that the quadrons are uncorrelated for\nsimplicity the density of states is broken into multiplication\nof one quadron probability density function (PDF)\n\u0398 ({V q }) = \u220f P (V quadron ) and the partition function is simplified\nto\n\n(\n\nZ = \u222be\n\n\u2212Vq \u03bbX\n\n),\nN\n\nP (Vq ) dVq\n\n(3)\n\nwhere N is the number of quadrons in the system.\nExtracting the PDF of quadron area for Voronoi tessellation\nwe obtain a Gamma distribution: (Fig. 7C),\n\nP(Vq ) = b a \u0393(a) \u22c5 Vq\n\na \u22121\n\nexp(\u2212bVq ) .\n\nAs a simple example, the PDF is used in eq.

The\ncharacterization is compatible with the Edwards entropic\nformalism and to demonstrate its use we considered a\nsimplified uncorrelated system and calculated the\nexpectation values of moments of the quadron areas. This is\nthe first stage in the characterization. Taking into\nconsideration the shape the plateau borders and vertices as\nadditional degrees of freedom is the next stage.\nAcknowledgment\nWe wish to thank Stephen J Neethling for his help with\nfoam production via surface evolver.\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nEdwards, S.
