This paper determines the representation type of the IwahoriHecke algebras of type B when q 6= \u00b11. In particular, we show that a single\nparameter non\u2013semisimple Iwahori\u2013Hecke algebra of type B has finite representation type if and only if q is a simple root of the Poincar\u00e9 polynomial,\nconfirming a conjecture of Uno's [18].\n\n1. Introduction\nIn this paper we determine the representation type of the Hecke algebras of\ntype B. Previously, Uno [18] determined the representation type of the (one parameter) Iwahori\u2013Hecke algebras for the rank 2 Coxeter groups and the Coxeter\ngroups of type A. We build upon Uno's work to study the Hecke algebras of type B;\nin particular, we settle Uno's conjecture in this case.\nLet R be an integral domain and suppose that q and Q are invertible elements\nof R. The Iwahori\u2013Hecke algebra H = Hq,Q (Bn ) of type Bn is the unital associative\nR\u2013algebra with generators T0 , T1 , . . . , Tn\u22121 and relations\n(T0 + 1)(T0 \u2212 Q) = 0, (Ti + 1)(Ti \u2212 q) = 0 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1,\nT0 T1 T0 T1 = T1 T0 T1 T0 ,\nTi+1 Ti Ti+1 = Ti Ti+1 Ti for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 2,\nTi Tj = Tj Ti for 0 \u2264 i < j \u2212 1 \u2264 n \u2212 2.\nWe will determine the representation type of H .\nLet Hq (An\u22121 ) be the subalgebra of H generated by T1 , . . . , Tn\u22121 ; then Hq (An\u22121 )\nis isomorphic to the Iwahori\u2013Hecke algebra of the symmetric group of degree n.\nLet e \u2208 {1, 2, 3, . . . , \u221e} be the multiplicative order of q in R.\n1 (Uno) [18, Proposition 3.7,Theorem 3.8] Suppose that R is a field and that q 6=\n1. Then Hq (An\u22121 ) is of finite representation type if and only if n < 2e.\nNote that although Uno stated the theorem only in the case where R is the field\nof complex numbers; this is not essential in his proof. We also remark that K. Erdmann and D. K. Nakano [10, Theorem 1.2] have determined the representation\ntype of all of the blocks of Hq (An\u22121 ); so (1) also follows from their result.\nThe following reduction theorem, together with (1), will allow us to assume that\n\u2212Q is a power of q.\n2 (Dipper\u2013James) [7, Theorem 4.17] Suppose that Q 6= \u2212q f for any f \u2208 Z.\nThen Hq,Q (Bn ) is Morita equivalent to\nn\nM\n\nHq (Am\u22121 ) \u2297 Hq (An\u2212m\u22121 ).\n\nm=0\n\nKey words and phrases. Hecke algebras, representation type.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nSUSUMU ARIKI AND ANDREW MATHAS\n\nCombining the last two results we obtain.\nCorollary 3. Suppose that R is a field and that Q =\n6 \u2212q f for any f \u2208 Z. Then\nHq,Q (Bn ) is of finite representation type if and only if n < 2e.\nIt remains to determine the representation type of H when Q = \u2212q f for some\nf \u2208 Z. When Q = \u2212q f the relation for T0 becomes (T0 + 1)(T0 + q f ) = 0. If e is\nfinite we may assume that 0 \u2264 f < e. It is convenient to renormalize T0 as \u2212T0 ,\nwhen 0 \u2264 f \u2264 2e , and as \u2212q \u2212f T0 , when e2 < f < e; in this way, the relation for T0\nbecomes (T0 \u2212 1)(T0 \u2212 q f ) = 0 where 0 \u2264 f \u2264 2e whenever e is finite.\nHenceforth we assume that q is a primitive eth root of unity in R and that T0\nsatisfies the relation (T0 \u2212 1)(T0 \u2212 q f ) = 0 where 0 \u2264 f \u2264 e2 . As the R\u2013algebra H\nnow only depends on q we now write H = Hq (Bn ), or HR,q (Bn ) when we wish to\nemphasize the choice of R.\nThe main result of this paper is the following. We will consider the cases q = \u00b11\n(that is, e = 1 and e = 2) separately in [4].\nTheorem 4. Suppose that R is a field and that e \u2265 3 and 0 \u2264 f \u2264\nHq (Bn ) is of finite representation type if and only if\n\ne\n2.\n\nThen\n\nn < min{e, 2f + 4}.\nUno [18] asked whether the representation type of a non\u2013semisimple single parameter Iwahori\u2013Hecke algebra is finite if and only if q is a simple root of the\nPoincar\u00e9 polynomial of the corresponding finite Coxeter group. With the assumptions currently in place, the one parameter Hecke algebra of type B corresponds\nto e being even and f = 2e \u2212 1; so our result gives an affirmative answer to Uno's\nquestion in type B. In fact, if e is even and H is not semisimple then Theorem 4\nsays that H is of finite representation type if and only if 2e = f + 1 \u2264 n < e; this\nis if and only if q is a simple root of the Poincar\u00e9 polynomial (q is a root of the\nfactor xe \u2212 1 = 0). If H is a non\u2013semisimple one parameter Hecke algebra of type\nB with e odd then, by Corollary 3, H is of finite representation type if and only if\ne \u2264 n < 2e; again, this is if and only if q is a simple root of the Poincar\u00e9 polynomial\n(this time q is a root of x2e \u2212 1 = 0).\nThe proof of Theorem 4 will occupy all of this paper. In sections 2 and 3 we\nrecall the results that we need from the representation theory of algebras and from\nthe representation theory of H ; section 4 shows that H has infinite representation\ntype when n \u2265 e; section 5 shows that H has infinite representation type when\nn \u2265 2f + 4; finally, section 6 shows that H has finite representation type in the\nremaining cases.\n2. Preliminaries on representation type\nAn algebra A has finite representation type if there are only a finite number of\nisomorphism classes of indecomposable A\u2013modules; otherwise, A has infinite representation type. This section summarizes the results that we need on the representation type of algebras. More details can be found in the books of Auslander, Reiten\nand Smal\u00f8 [5] and Benson [6].\nSuppose that K is a field. We always assume that K is a splitting field for A.\nThe following two results are well\u2013known. Throughout the paper, all modules are\nright modules.\n\n\fTHE REPRESENTATION TYPE OF HECKE ALGEBRAS OF TYPE B\n\n3\n\nLemma 5. Let A be a finite dimensional K\u2013algebra.\n(i) Suppose that I is a two\u2013sided ideal of A such that A/I has infinite representation type. Then A is of infinite representation type.\n(ii) Suppose that B is a direct summand of A as a (B, B)\u2013bimodule. Then\n(a) If B is of infinite representation type then so is A.\n(b) If A is of finite representation type then so is B.\nLemma 6. Let A be a finite dimensional K\u2013algebra and let P1 , . . . Pl be the complete set of projective indecomposable A\u2013modules, up to isomorphism. Then\n(i) A is Morita equivalent to EndA (P1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Pl ).\n(ii) if EndA (Pi ) has infinite representation type for some i then A has infinite\nrepresentation type.\n(iii) for each i the algebra EndA (Pi ) has finite representation type if and only\nif EndA (Pi ) \u223c\n= K[x]/hxm i for some integer m \u2265 0 (which depends on i).\nFor any A\u2013module M let Rad M be the Jacobson radical of M . Let D1 , . . . , Dl\nbe a complete set of isomorphism classes of simple A\u2013modules and let P1 , . . . , Pl\nbe the corresponding projective indecomposables.\nIn the theory of algebras Dynkin diagrams are valued graphs, with the underlying\ngraph being the usual Dynkin diagram; see, for example, [5, VII.3, p241]. If A is\na symmetric algebra, then the separation diagram of A is the valued graph with\n(a,b)\n\nvertices {1, . . . , l, 1\u2032 , . . . , l\u2032 } and edges i\nj \u2032 where a = [Rad Pi / Rad2 Pi : Sj ] and\n2\nb = [Rad Pj / Rad Pj : Si ].\nThe following result is fundamental, and may be derived from the theory of\nhereditary algebras.\nTheorem 7 (Gabriel). Suppose that A is an indecomposable algebra such that\nRad2 A = 0. Then A is of finite representation type if and only if the separation\ndiagram of A is a disjoint union of Dynkin diagrams of finite type as a valued graph.\nThe Auslander\u2013Reiten quiver of A is the directed graph with vertices the indecomposable A\u2013modules and edges the irreducible morphisms between the indecomposables (a map \u03c6 : M \u2212\u2192 N is irreducible if \u03c6 has no left or right inverse and\nwhenever \u03c6 factorizes as \u03c6 = \u03b8\u03c8 then either \u03b8 has a right inverse or \u03c8 has a left\ninverse).\nTheorem 8 (Auslander). Let A be an indecomposable algebra and suppose that the\nAuslander\u2013Reiten quiver of A has a connected component which has a finite number\nof vertices. Then A is of finite representation type.\nUno used Auslander\u2013Reiten sequences and Theorem 8 to prove the following.\nTheorem 9 (Uno [18, Theorem 3.6]). Suppose that A is a symmetric indecomposable algebra and that the decomposition matrix of A can be written in the form\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1 0 *** 0\n\uf8ec 1 1 *** 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec .. . .\n.. \uf8f7 .\n..\n\uf8ec .\n.\n. . \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed 0 ***\n1 1 \uf8f8\n0 ***\n0 1\nThen A is of finite representation type.\n\n\f4\n\nSUSUMU ARIKI AND ANDREW MATHAS\n\nIt turns out that in the cases where H has finite representation type all of the\nnon\u2013semisimple blocks of H satisfy the hypotheses of Theorem 9; hence they are of\nfinite type. Hence, in principle, we can compute all of the indecomposable modules\nusing Auslander\u2013Reiten sequences when H has finite type.\nWe remark that Uno's paper does not actually contain the statement above.\nHowever, the result can be extracted from his paper because the assumptions of\nTheorem 9 appear as [18, Theorem 3.4] and these are all that are used in the proof\nof his Theorem 3.6.\n3. Results from the representation theory of Hq (Bn )\nWe now turn to the representation theory of Hq (Bn ).\nLet \u2217 be the anti\u2013involution of Hq (Bn ) determined by Ti\u2217 = Ti for 0 \u2264 i < n.\nIf M is a right Hq (Bn )-module then HomK (M, K) is naturally a left Hq (Bn )module and it becomes a right module by twisting the Hq (Bn )\u2013action by the anti\u2013\ninvolution \u2217. We call this the dual of M ; M is self\u2013dual if it is isomorphic to its\ndual.\nIt is well\u2013known that Hq (Bn ) is a symmetric algebra; hence we have the following.\nLemma 10. The algebra Hq (Bn ) is a symmetric algebra. In particular, if D\nis a simple Hq (Bn )\u2013module and P is its projective cover then P/ Rad P \u223c\n= D,\nSoc P \u223c\n= D and P is self-dual.\nAs P is self-dual, the dual of the radical series of P is the socle series of P . We\nremark that this does not mean that the radical series must be symmetric with\nrespect to its middle layer.\nApplying Lemma 5(ii)(a) to the inclusion Hq (Bm ) \u0592\u2192 Hq (Bn ), for m \u2264 n, yields\nthe following.\nCorollary 11. Suppose that m \u2264 n and that Hq (Bm ) is of infinite representation\ntype. Then Hq (Bn ) is of infinite representation type.\nRecall that a partition of n is an non\u2013increasing sequence\n\u03c3 = (\u03c31 \u2265 \u03c32 \u2265 . . . ) of\nP\nnon\u2013negative integers such that |\u03c3| = n where |\u03c3| = i \u03c3i . A bipartition of n is an\nordered pair \u03bb = (\u03bb(1) , \u03bb(2) ) of partitions \u03bb(1) and \u03bb(2) such that |\u03bb(1) | + |\u03bb(2) | = n;\nwe write \u03bb \u22a2 n and |\u03bb| = n. The set of bipartitions is naturally a poset with partial\norder D where \u03bb D \u03bc if for all k \u2265 1 and l \u2265 1\nk\nX\ni=1\n\n(1)\n\n\u03bbi\n\n\u2265\n\nk\nX\ni=1\n\n(1)\n\n\u03bci\n\nand |\u03bb(1) | +\n\nl\nX\nj=1\n\n(2)\n\n\u03bbj\n\n\u2265 |\u03bc(1) | +\n\nl\nX\n\n(2)\n\n\u03bcj .\n\nj=1\n\nIf \u03bb D \u03bc we say that \u03bb dominates \u03bc. If \u03bb D \u03bc and \u03bb 6= \u03bc we write \u03bb \u22b2 \u03bc.\nLet A = Z[t, t\u22121 ] where t is an indeterminate. Then Dipper, James and Murphy\n\u03bb\nhave shown that there exist a family { SA\n| \u03bb \u22a2 n } of free A \u2013modules which are\nequipped with operators T0 , T1 , . . . , Tn\u22121 \u2208 EndA (S \u03bb ) which satisfy the defining\n\u03bb\nrelations of Ht (Bn ). Consequently, S \u03bb = SA\n\u2297A K is a Hq (Bn )\u2013module, where\nHq (Bn ) is the Hecke algebra defined over the field K with q \u2208 K and we consider K\nas an A \u2013module by letting t act on K as multiplication by q.\nThe module S \u03bb is a Specht module of Hq (Bn ). It comes equipped with a symmetric bilinear form h , i such that huTi , vi = hu, vTi i for 0 \u2264 i < n and all u, v \u2208 S \u03bb .\n\n\fTHE REPRESENTATION TYPE OF HECKE ALGEBRAS OF TYPE B\n\n5\n\nConsequently, the module\nrad S \u03bb = { u \u2208 S \u03bb | hu, vi = 0 for all v \u2208 S \u03bb }\nis an H \u2013submodule of S \u03bb . Set D\u03bb = S \u03bb / rad S \u03bb .\nThe modules S \u03bb enjoy the following properties. Theorem 12(i) is proved by\nmodifying the proof of [9, Theorem 6.1]. The others are stated in [9, Theorem 6.5]\nand [9, Theorem 6.6].\nTheorem 12 (Dipper\u2013James\u2013Murphy [9]). Suppose that K is a field.\n(i) Any Hq (Bn )\u2013submodule of S \u03bb contains rad S \u03bb or is contained in rad S \u03bb .\nIn particular, the module D\u03bb is either 0 or an absolutely irreducible self\u2013\ndual Hq (Bn )\u2013module.\n(ii) { D\u03bc | D\u03bc 6= 0 } is a complete set of pairwise non\u2013isomorphic irreducible\nHq (Bn )\u2013modules.\n(iii) If D\u03bc 6= 0 then the decomposition multiplicity [S \u03bb : D\u03bc ] 6= 0 only if \u03bb D \u03bc;\nfurther, [S \u03bc : D\u03bc ] = 1.\nIn particular, if D\u03bc 6= 0 then D\u03bc is the unique head of S \u03bc and Rad S \u03bc = rad S \u03bc ;\nconsequently, S \u03bc is indecomposable and if S \u03bc 6= D\u03bc then S \u03bc has Loewy length\nat least 2. If D\u03bc 6= 0 let P \u03bc be the corresponding principal indecomposable H \u2013\nmodule; in other words, P \u03bc is the projective cover of D\u03bc . Let d\u03bb\u03bc = [S \u03bb : D\u03bc ] be\nthe multiplicity of D\u03bc as a composition factor of S \u03bb .\nIt is implicit in the work of Dipper, James and Murphy that Hq (Bn ) is a cellular\nalgebra in the sense of Graham and Lehrer [12] (compare [8]). Consequently, the\ntheory of cellular algebras gives us the following result.\nCorollary 13. Let P be a projective H \u2013module.\n(i) Then P has a Specht filtration; thus, there exist bipartitions \u03bd1 , . . . , \u03bdk and\na filtration P = P k > P k\u22121 > * * * > P 1 > 0 such that P i /P i\u22121 \u223c\n= S \u03bdi , for\n1 < i \u2264 k, and i < j whenever \u03bdi \u22b2 \u03bdj .\n(ii) Suppose that P = P \u03bc for some bipartition \u03bc with D\u03bc 6= 0. Then the\nSpecht filtration can be chosen so that d\u03bb\u03bc = # { 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k | \u03bdi = \u03bb }. In\nparticular, if \u03bb is maximal in the dominance ordering such that d\u03bb\u03bc 6= 0\nthen P \u03bc has a submodule isomorphic to S \u03bb .\nProof. These results are implicit in the work of Graham\u2013Lehrer [12] (and slightly\nmore explicit in [16, Lemma 2.19]). The existence of the filtration is exactly [12,\nLemma 2.9(ii)]; that we can order the bipartitions \u03bdi by dominance follows from the\nchoice of \u03a60 \u2282 \u03a61 \u2282 * * * \u2282 \u03a6d as a maximal chain of ideals in the proof of this result.\nPart (ii) follows by combining Lemma 2.10(i) and Theorem 3.7(ii) of [12].\n\u0003\nWe remark that some care must be taken when working with Specht filtrations because Specht modules indexed by different bipartitions can be isomorphic\nwhen H is not semisimple. This technicality can be avoided by working with a\nmodular system and lifting the projective module to the discrete valuation ring\nwhere the Specht filtration is unambiguously defined.\nIn principle, Theorem 12(ii) produces all of the irreducible H \u2013modules; however,\ndetermining when D\u03bb is non\u2013zero is still a difficult problem. The non\u2013zero D\u03bb have\nnow been classified by the first author; to describe this result we need some more\nnomenclature.\n\n\f6\n\nSUSUMU ARIKI AND ANDREW MATHAS\n\nThe diagram [\u03bb] of a bipartition \u03bb = (\u03bb(1) , \u03bb(2) ) is the set of nodes\n(k)\n\n[\u03bb] = { (i, j, k) | 1 \u2264 j \u2264 \u03bbi\n\nfor i \u2265 1 and k = 1, 2 } ,\n\nwhich we will think of as being an ordered pair of arrays of boxes in the plane.\nGiven two nodes x = (i, j, k) and y = (i\u2032 , j \u2032 , k \u2032 ) we say that y is below x if either\nk = k \u2032 and i < i\u2032 , or k < k \u2032 . Further, x \u2208 [\u03bb] is removable if [\u03bb] \\ {x} is the\ndiagram of a bipartition; similarly, y \u2208\n/ [\u03bb] is addable if [\u03bb] \u222a {y} is the diagram\nof a bipartition. The content of x is c(x) = j \u2212 i + (k \u2212 1)f and the residue of x\nis res(x) = c(x) (mod e) - recall that q is an eth root of unity and Q = \u2212q f . If\nr = res(x) we call x an r\u2013node.\nAn r\u2013node x is normal if whenever y is a removable r\u2013node below x then there\nare more removable r\u2013nodes between x and y than there are addable r\u2013nodes, and\nthere are at least as many removable r\u2013nodes below x as addable r\u2013nodes below x.\nIn addition, x is good if there are no normal r\u2013nodes above \u0001x. Here, 0 \u2264 r < e.\nFinally, a bipartition \u03bc is Kleshchev if either \u03bc = (0), (0) or \u03bc contains a good\nnode x such that [\u03bc] \\ {x} is the diagram of a Kleshchev bipartition.\n\nTheorem 14 (Ariki [2]). Suppose that \u03bc is a bipartition of n. Then D\u03bc 6= 0 if and\nonly if \u03bc is a Kleshchev bipartition.\n\nThe proof of this result builds on the next theorem which reveals the deep connections between the representation theory of Hq (Bn ) and the representation theory of\nb e ) of type A(1) in characteristic zero.

Let O \u2282 \u00d5 be an embedding into a complete discrete valuation ring \u00d5\nwhere \u00d5 has residue field k and K \u2282 K\u0303 is a field extension such that \u00d5 \u2282 K\u0303.\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nSince D\u03bc is absolutely irreducible, PK\u0303\n= PK\n\u2297 K\u0303.

Then MO is a projective HO \u2013module by the definition of\nthe fi . Therefore, by Corollary 13 applied to HO , the module MO has a Specht\n\u03bc\nfiltration. Let MKP= MO \u2297 K; then, by assumption, [MK ] = N [PK\n]; therefore,\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n[MK ] = N [SK ] + \u03bb\u22b2\u03bc N d\u03bb\u03bc [SK ], where d\u03bb\u03bc = [SK : DK ]. Consequently, there\n\u2295N\n\n\u03bc\nis a surjective homomorphism MO \u2192 SO\n; tensoring with k gives a surjective\n\u03c6\n\u03bc \u2295N\n\u03bc\n(as D is the head of S \u03bc ).

On the other hand, Pk\u03bc is a\nprojective Hk \u2013module so we also have a commutative diagram\n\nMk\nHence, Pk\u03bc\n\n\u2295N\n\n\u03c8\n\nPk\u03bc\n\n\u2295N\n\nPk\u03bc\n\n\u2295N\n\n0\n\nis a direct summand of Mk .

The setup is a little technical;\nwe include it for completeness. Let p be the maximal ideal of K[t] generated by\nt \u2212 q and let O = K[t]p , where t is an indeterminate over K; then K \u223c\n= O/p (so O is\na localized ring and, in particular, a discrete valuation ring). Let HO be the Hecke\nalgebra over O with parameters t and \u2212q f (t\u2212q +1)n ; then HO \u2297K(t) is semisimple\nand HK is the reduction of HO modulo p. Let \u03bdp be the p\u2013adic valuation on O.\nPreviously we defined the residue res(x) of a node x = (i, j, k). Define the O\u2013\nresidue of x = (i, j, k) to be resO (x) = tj\u2212i q (k\u22121)f (t \u2212 q + 1)(k\u22121)n . The relationship\nbetween these two definitions is that resO (x) \u2297 1K = q res(x) .\nLet \u03bb be a bipartition and for each node x = (i, j, k) \u2208 [\u03bb] let rx be the corresponding rim hook (so rx is a rim hook in [\u03bb(k) ]); the point is that [\u03bb] \\ rx\nis the diagram of a bipartition. Let ll(rx ) be the leg length of rx and define\nresO (rx ) = resO (fx ) where fx is the foot node of rx . The definitions of these terms\ncan be found, for example, in [16].\nSuppose that \u03bb and \u03bc are bipartitions of n.

Suppose that S \u03bb and S \u03bc are in the same block. Then \u03bb and \u03bc\nare linked by hooks.\nProof. By definition, S \u03bb and S \u03bc are in the same block if and only if there exists a\nsequence of bipartitions \u03bc = \u03bd1 , . . . , \u03bdl = \u03bb such that S \u03bdi and S \u03bdi+1 have a common\ncomposition factor. Thus, it is enough to prove that if D\u03bc 6= 0 appears in S \u03bb\nthen \u03bb and \u03bc are linked by hooks. If \u03bb 6= \u03bc then \u03bb \u22b2 \u03bc by Theorem 12(iii). The\nsum formula implies that D\u03bc appears in S \u03bd for some \u03bd such that \u03bb \u22b2 \u03bd and \u03bb and\n\u03bd are linked by hooks. By induction on dominance \u03bd and \u03bc are linked by hooks so\nwe are done.\n\u0003\nIf \u03bb is a bipartition let res(\u03bb) be the multiset { res(x) | x \u2208 [\u03bb] }. Then as a\ncorollary of the Proposition we have the following (there is an easier proof).\nCorollary 20 (Dipper\u2013James\u2013Murphy [9, Corollary 8.7]). Suppose that S \u03bb and S \u03bc\nare in the same block. Then res(\u03bb) = res(\u03bc) (as multisets).\nBy the Corollary we can define the residue of a block B to be the multiset\nres(B) = res(\u03bb) where \u03bb is any bipartition contained in B.\nIn fact, Grojnowski [13] has recently shown that the converse of Corollary 20 is\ntrue; so, two Specht modules S \u03bb and S \u03bc belong to the same block if and only if\nres(\u03bb) = res(\u03bc). We will not need this stronger result.\n4. The representation type when n = e\nIn this section we will prove the following result. Recall that we are assuming\nthat e \u2265 3.\nTheorem 21.

Further, by Lemma 5 it is\nenough to show that one block of H has infinite representation type; we will show\nthat the block B with residues {0, 1, . . . , e \u2212 1} has infinite representation type.\nThere will be several cases to consider. To begin suppose that f 6= 0. Because\nall of the residues in B are distinct a bipartition \u03bb = (\u03bb(1) , \u03bb(2) ) appears\u0001 in B only\nif \u03bb(1) and \u03bb(2) are both hook partitions; that is, \u03bb = (a, 1b ), (c, 1d ) for some\na, b, c, d. Define bipartitions\n\u0001\n\u03bbk = (0), (k, 1e\u2212k ) ,\nfor 1 \u2264 k \u2264 e,\n\u0001\ne\u2212k\n\u03bck = (k, 1 ), (0) ,\nfor 1 \u2264 k \u2264 e,\n\u0001\n\u03bbk,l = (f \u2212 l, 1e\u2212f \u2212k ), (k, 1l ) ,\nfor 1 \u2264 k \u2264 e \u2212 f and 0 \u2264 l < f.\n\nIt is easily checked that all of these bipartitions belong to B. Certainly, the two\nsets of bipartitions {\u03bbk } and {\u03bck } are disjoint; the restrictions on k and l ensure\nthat \u03bbk,l 6= \u03bbm and \u03bbk,l 6= \u03bcm for any m. Consequently, this is a complete list of\nthe bipartitions which appear in B, with no repeats.\nProposition 22. Suppose that n = e and that 1 \u2264 f \u2264 2e .\n(i) The complete set of Kleshchev bipartitions in B is\n{ \u03bbk | 1 \u2264 k < e } \u222a { \u03bbk,l | 1 \u2264 k \u2264 e \u2212 f and 0 \u2264 l < f } .\n(ii) For 1 \u2264 k < e we have\n\uf8f1\n\u03bbk,f \u22121\n\uf8f4\n] + [S \u03bbk+1,f \u22121 ],\n\uf8f2[S\n\u03bbk\n\u03bbk\n\u03bbk+1\n\u03bb\n[P ] = [S ] + [S\n] + [S e\u2212f,f \u22121 ],\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u03bbe\u2212f,e\u2212k\n[S\n] + [S \u03bbe\u2212f,e\u2212k\u22121 ],\n\n(iii) For 1 \u2264 k \u2264 e \u2212 f and 0 \u2264 l < f we have\n\uf8f1 \u03bb\n[S k\u22121,0 ] + [S \u03bcf +k\u22121 ] + [S \u03bcf +k ],\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2[S \u03bcf ] + [S \u03bcf +1 ],\n[P \u03bbk,l ] = [S \u03bbk,l ] +\n\uf8f4\n[S \u03bbk,l\u22121 ] + [S \u03bbk\u22121,l ] + [S \u03bbk\u22121,l\u22121 ],\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u03bb1,l\u22121\n[S\n] + [S \u03bcf \u2212l ] + [S \u03bcf \u2212l+1 ],\n\nif\nif\nif\nif\n\nif k < e \u2212 f,\nif k = e \u2212 f,\nif k > e \u2212 f.\n\nk\nk\nk\nk\n\n6= 1\n=1\n6= 1\n=1\n\nand\nand\nand\nand\n\nl = 0,\nl = 0,\nl 6= 0,\nl 6= 0.\n\nProof. It is easy to see that the bipartitions \u03bbe and \u03bck , for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 e, are not\nKleshchev. Next suppose that 1 \u2264 k \u2264 e \u2212 f .

We need to consider several cases. First\nwe observe that\n(23)\n\n[P \u03bb1 ] = [S \u03bb1 ] + [S \u03bb2 ] + [S \u03bb2,f \u22121 ] + [S \u03bb1,f \u22121 ]\n\nby Proposition 22(i). We will use this to determine the structure of P \u03bb1 .\nCase 1: e \u2265 5 and f \u2265 2. Then e \u2212 f \u2265 3 since e \u2212 f \u2265 2e = 2.5. By (17) we can\nuse Proposition 22 to compute the decomposition numbers d\u03bb\u03bc for the four Specht\nmodules appearing in (23); this gives the following table (omitted entries are zero).\n\u03bb1\n\nS\nS \u03bb2\nS \u03bb2,f \u22121\nS \u03bb1,f \u22121\n\nD\u03bb1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\nD\u03bb2\n.\n1\n1\n0\n\nD\u03bb3,f \u22121\n.\n.\n1\n0\n\nD\u03bb2,f \u22121\n.\n.\n1\n1\n\nD\u03bb1,f \u22121\n.\n.\n.\n1\n\nConsequently, [P \u03bb1 ] = 4[D\u03bb1 ]+2[D\u03bb2 ]+[D\u03bb1,f \u22121 ]+2[D\u03bb2,f \u22121 ]+[D\u03bb3,f \u22121 ]. By Corollary 13(ii), P \u03bb1 has submodule isomorphic to S \u03bb1,f \u22121 . Therefore, S \u03bb1,f \u22121 has both\n\n\f12\n\nSUSUMU ARIKI AND ANDREW MATHAS\n\na simple head and simple socle; so, looking at the submatrix of the decomposition\nmatrix above, the Loewy structure of S \u03bb1,f \u22121 is\nS\n\n\u03bb1,f \u22121\n\nD\u03bb1,f \u22121\n= D\u03bb2,f \u22121 .\nD\u03bb1\n\nWe also have\nS \u03bb2 =\n\nD\u03bb2\n.\nD\u03bb1\n\nConsidering the dual of Rad S \u03bb1,f \u22121 and S \u03bb2 , we conclude that D\u03bb2 and D\u03bb2,f \u22121\nappear in Rad P \u03bb1 / Rad2 P \u03bb1 . If 0 \u2212\u2192 D\u03bb1 \u2212\u2192 X \u2212\u2192 D\u03bb1 \u2212\u2192 0 is an exact\nsequence then, for 1 \u2264 i < n, Ti \u2212 q acts invertibly on X so that Ti acts as \u22121 on X.\nSimilarly, T0 also acts as multiplication by a scalar on X since f 6= 0. Therefore,\nevery such exact sequence splits and so Ext1 (D\u03bb1 , D\u03bb1 ) = 0; consequently, D\u03bb1 is\nnot a composition factor of Rad P \u03bb1 / Rad2 P \u03bb1 .\nAgain, by Corollary 13 P \u03bb1 has a Specht filtration so Rad P \u03bb1 /S \u03bb1,f \u22121 has a\nSpecht filtration whose successive quotients are S \u03bb2 and S \u03bb2,f \u22121 . This means that\nRad P \u03bb1 / Rad2 P \u03bb1 = D\u03bb2 \u2295 D\u03bb2,f \u22121 .\n\u03bb2,f \u22121\nWe now use the fact that Rad S \u03bb1,f \u22121 = D D\u03bb1 to prove that D\u03bb1 is contained\nin Rad S \u03bb2,f \u22121 / Rad2 S \u03bb2,f \u22121 . As Rad S \u03bb1,f \u22121 has a unique head there is a surjection P \u03bb2,f \u22121 \u2212\u2192 Rad S \u03bb1,f \u22121 . Note also that P \u03bb2,f \u22121 has a Specht filtration with\nsuccessive quotients S \u03bb2,f \u22121 and S \u03bb2,f \u22122 , S \u03bb1,f \u22121 , S \u03bb1,f \u22122 . Since S \u03bb2,f \u22122 , S \u03bb1,f \u22121 ,\nS \u03bb1,f \u22122 must map to D\u03bb1 , and each of these has unique head which is not isomorphic to D\u03bb1 , this surjection induces a map S \u03bb2,f \u22121 \u2212\u2192 Rad S \u03bb1,f \u22121 . Therefore,\nRad S \u03bb2,f \u22121 / Rad2 S \u03bb2,f \u22121 contains D\u03bb1 as a summand. Let U be a module such\nthat Rad2 S \u03bb2,f \u22121 \u2286 U \u2286 Rad S \u03bb2,f \u22121 and Rad S \u03bb2,f \u22121 /U \u223c\n= D\u03bb1 and set\nV = (Rad P \u03bb1 )/(U + S \u03bb1,f \u22121 ).\nThen there is a short exact sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192\n\nD\u03bb2,f \u22121\nD \u03bb1\n\n\u2212\u2192 V \u2212\u2192\n\nD \u03bb2\nD \u03bb1\n\n\u2212\u2192 0\n\nand V / Rad V \u223c\n= D\u03bb2 \u2295 D\u03bb2,f \u22121 . Hence, we also have 0 \u2212\u2192 D\u03bb1 \u2212\u2192 Rad V \u2212\u2192\n\u03bb1\nD \u2212\u2192 0 and consequently Rad V = D\u03bb1 \u2295 D\u03bb1 . Therefore, Rad2 P \u03bb1 / Rad3 P \u03bb1\ncontains D\u03bb1 \u2295D\u03bb1 and it follows that P \u03bb1 / Rad3 P \u03bb1 contains D\u03bb1 \u2295D\u03bb1 as an H \u2013\nsubmodule, that another D\u03bb1 appears as the head of P \u03bb1 / Rad3 P \u03bb1 , and that these\nare the only ways in which D\u03bb1 appear as a composition factor of P \u03bb1 / Rad3 P \u03bb1 .\nTherefore, we have that EndH / Rad3 H (P \u03bb1 / Rad3 P \u03bb1 ) 6\u223c\n= k[x]/hxm i. Hence, EndH (P \u03bb1 )\nis not of finite representation type by Lemma 6, so H has infinite representation\ntype by Lemma 5(ii).\nCase 2: e = 4 and f = 2. By Proposition 22 and (23), we have the same table as\nabove if we replace \u03bb3,f \u22121 by \u03bb3 . Thus\n[P \u03bb1 ] = 4[D\u03bb1 ] + 2[D\u03bb2 ] + [D\u03bb3 ] + 2[D\u03bb2,1 ] + [D\u03bb1,1 ].\nThe argument used in case 1 shows that P \u03bb1 / Rad3 P \u03bb1 contains D\u03bb1 \u2295 D\u03bb1 as an\nH \u2013submodule. Hence, EndH (P \u03bb1 ) is again of infinite type.\nCase 3: f = 1. Again using Proposition 22 and (23) we find that\n[P \u03bb1 ] = 4[D\u03bb1 ] + 2[D\u03bb2 ] + [D\u03bb1,0 ] + 2[D\u03bb2,0 ] + \u03b4e\u22654 [D\u03bb3,0 ],\n\n\fTHE REPRESENTATION TYPE OF HECKE ALGEBRAS OF TYPE B\n\n13\n\nwhere \u03b4e\u22654 = 1 if e \u2265 4 and \u03b4e\u22654 = 0 otherwise. Almost the same argument as\nbefore again shows that P \u03bb1 / Rad3 P \u03bb1 contains D\u03bb1 \u2295 D\u03bb1 as an H \u2013submodule;\nhowever, to show that Rad S \u03bb2,0 / Rad2 S \u03bb2,0 contains D\u03bb1 we need to argue in a\ndifferent way: since [P \u03bb2,0 ] = [S \u03bb2,0 ] + [S \u03bb1,0 ] + [S \u03bc2 ] + [S \u03bc3 ] and [S \u03bc2 ] = [D\u03bb2,0 ] +\n[D\u03bb1,0 ], [S \u03bc3 ] = [D\u03bb3,0 ] + [D\u03bb2,0 ] do not contain D\u03bb1 , the surjection P \u03bb2,0 \u2212\u2192\nRad S \u03bb1,0 induces a surjection S \u03bb2,0 \u2212\u2192 Rad S \u03bb1,0 . Thus, once again H is of\ninfinite representation type by Lemma 6 and Lemma 5.\nCase 4: f = 0.\nIt remains to consider the case f = 0. This case is somewhat degenerate as 1 is the only possible eigenvalue for the action of T0 upon a\nrepresentation. Because f = 0 there are no bipartitions of the form \u03bbk,l in B so\nProposition 22 cannot hold in this case. A similar argument shows that we have\nthe following simpler statement when f = 0.\nProposition 24. Suppose that f = 0.\n(i) { \u03bbk | 1 \u2264 k < e } is the complete set of Kleshchev bipartitions in B.\n(ii) For 1 \u2264 k < e we have [P \u03bbk ] = [S \u03bbk ] + [S \u03bbk+1 ] + [S \u03bck ] + [S \u03bck+1 ].\nTo apply this result we do not have to work as hard as in the previous cases.\nFirst observe that for 1 \u2264 k < e the module D\u03bbk can be constructed by letting T0\ne\u2212k\nact as 1 on the simple H (Ae )\u2013module\nD(k,1 ) (by induction both modules have\n\u0001\ne\u22121\nthe same dimension; namely, k\u22121\n). Let M \u03bbk be the H \u2013module obtained by\n\u0001\ne\u2212k\ne\u2212k\nletting T0 act as 10 11 on the H (Ae )\u2013module D(k,1 ) \u2295 D(k,1 ) . Then M \u03bbk\ncannot be semisimple as an H \u2013module because T0 does not act as a scalar. On\nthe other hand, the socle of M \u03bbk is simple (being isomorphic to D\u03bbk ); hence, M \u03bbk\nis indecomposable. This implies that [Rad P \u03bbk / Rad2 P \u03bbk : D\u03bbk ] 6= 0.\nNow [S \u03bbk ] = [D\u03bbk ] + [D\u03bbk\u22121 ] for 1 \u2264 k < e by Proposition 24. Hence, S \u03bbk is\nindecomposable and [Rad P \u03bbk / Rad2 P \u03bbk : D\u03bbk\u22121 ] 6= 0 for 2 \u2264 k < e. As D\u03bbk is\nself\u2013dual, by taking duals we also have\n[Rad P \u03bbk / Rad2 P \u03bbk : D\u03bbk+1 ] 6= 0,\nfor 1 \u2264 k < e \u2212 1. Combining these facts we conclude that\nRad P \u03bb1 / Rad2 P \u03bb1 \u2283 D\u03bb1 \u2295 D\u03bb2 ,\nRad P \u03bbk / Rad2 P \u03bbk \u2283 D\u03bbk\u22121 \u2295 D\u03bbk \u2295 D\u03bbk+1 , for 2 \u2264 k < e \u2212 1,\nand that Rad P \u03bbe\u22121 / Rad2 P \u03bbe\u22121 \u2283 D\u03bbe\u22121 \u2295 D\u03bbe\u22122 . Therefore, the separation diagram of B contains\n***\nConsequently, B has infinite representation type by Theorem 7.\nThis completes the proof of Theorem 21.\n\n\u0003\n\n5. The representation type when n \u2265 2f + 4\nRecall that we are assuming that e \u2265 3 and 0 \u2264 f \u2264 2e . This section is devoted\nto the proof of the following result.\nTheorem 25. Suppose n \u2265 2f + 4. Then H has infinite representation type.\nProof. By Corollary 11 it is enough to show that Hn has infinite representation\ntype when n = 2f + 4. Also, by the last section we may assume that e > n. Let\nB be the block B with residues {\u22121, 0, 0, 1, 1, . . . , f, f, f + 1}; so B contains the\n\n\f14\n\nSUSUMU ARIKI AND ANDREW MATHAS\n\n\u0001\nbipartition (2, 2), (2f ) ). We will show that B has infinite representation type. To\ndo this we need to consider two cases separately.\n\nCase 1: Suppose that f = 0 (and e > n = 4). We consider the block B with\nresidues {\u22121, 0, 0, 1}. It is easy\n\u0001 to see that there\u0001are precisely six \u0001bipartitions in this\n\u0001\nblock; namely, \u03bb\u00011 = (0), (22 ) , \u03bb2 = \u0001 (1), (2, 1) , \u03bb3 = (12 ), (2) , \u03bb4 = (2), (12 ) ,\n\u03bb5 = (2, 1), (1) and \u03bb6 = (22 ), (0) . Furthermore, of these bipartitions only \u03bb1\nand \u03bb2 are Kleshchev.

We first observe that P \u03bb2 is the\ninduced module P \u03bc2 \u2191B ; this follows from a calculation in the Grothendieck group.\nSimilarly, we also have that P \u03bb1 = P \u03bc1 \u2191B . Further, P \u03bci is uniserial of length 2\nand [P \u03bci ] = 2[D\u03bci ], for i = 1, 2. Next note that D\u03bci = S \u03bci , for i = 1, 2; hence,\nthe branching rules for Specht modules imply that [D\u03bc1 \u2191B ] = 2[D\u03bb1 ] + [D\u03bb2 ] and\n[D\u03bc2 \u2191B ] = [D\u03bb1 ] + 2[D\u03bb2 ].\nNext note that there are surjective homomorphisms P \u03bbi \u2212\u2192 D\u03bci \u2191B for i = 1, 2.\nAs D\u03bci \u2191B is self\u2013dual, D\u03bci \u2191B is a uniserial module whose top and bottom is\nisomorphic to D\u03bbi . To conclude, each P \u03bbi has a submodule Mi such that both\nP \u03bbi /Mi and Mi are isomorphic to the uniserial module D\u03bci \u2191B .\nNow we prove that Ext1 (D\u03bb2 , D\u03bb2 ) 6= 0. As Ext1 (D\u03bb1 , D\u03bb1 ) 6= 0, we know that\nthe radical series of P \u03bb1 has the form\nD\u03bb1\nD\u03bb1 \u2295 D\u03bb2\nD\u03bb1 \u2295 D\u03bb2\nD\u03bb1\nAssume that Ext1 (D\u03bb2 , D\u03bb2 ) = 0.

The assumption\nthat Rad P \u03bb2 / Rad2 P \u03bb2 = D\u03bb1 together with the radical structure of P \u03bb1 imply\n\n\fTHE REPRESENTATION TYPE OF HECKE ALGEBRAS OF TYPE B\n\n15\n\nthat this map lifts to a homomorphism P \u03bb2 \u2212\u2192 P \u03bb1 , whose image is of the form\nD\u03bb2\nD\u03bb1\nD\u03bb1\nThis contradicts our assumption that Rad2 P \u03bb2 / Rad3 P \u03bb2 = D\u03bb2 \u2295 D\u03bb2 .\nHence, Ext1 (D\u03bb2 , D\u03bb2 0 and Ext1 (D\u03bb1 , D\u03bb1 ) are both non\u2013zero. Therefore, Rad P \u03bb1 / Rad2 P \u03bb1\nand Rad P \u03bb2 / Rad2 P \u03bb2 both contain D\u03bb1 \u2295 D\u03bb2 as an H \u2013submodule. Therefore,\nthe separation diagram of B is\n. Consequently, B is of infinite type, by\nGabriel's theorem, and H has infinite representation type by Lemma 5(ii).\nCase 2: Suppose that 0 < f \u2264 2e . Now we are considering the block B of H with\nresidues {\u22121, 0, 0, 1, 1, . . . , f, f, f + 1}. Notice that f + 2 is a residue in B only if\nf + 1 \u2265 e \u2212 1 and \u22122 is a residue in B only if e \u2212 2 \u2264 f + 1; however, e > 6 because\ne > n = 2f + 4 and f \u2265 1; so f + 2 and \u22122 cannot be residues\nin B. Consequently,\n\u0001\nk l\nall of the bipartitions in B have the form\n(a,\nb),\n(2\n1\n)\n.\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nf +2\nf +1\n2\nf +1\nDefine bipartitions\n\u03bb\n=\n(0),\n(2\n)\n,\n\u03bb\n=\n(1),\n(2\n,\n1)\n,\n\u03bb\n=\n(1\n),\n(2\n)\n,\n1\n2\n3\n\u0001\n\u0001\nf\n2\nf\n\u03bb4 = (2), (2 , 1 ) and \u03bb5 = (2, 1), (2 , 1) .

Furthermore,\n[P \u03bb2 ] = [S \u03bb2 ] + [S \u03bb3 ] + [S \u03bb4 ] + [S \u03bb5 ] and the first five rows of the decomposition\nmatrix of B are as follows (all omitted entries are zero):\n\u03bb1\n\nS\nS \u03bb2\nS \u03bb3\nS \u03bb4\nS \u03bb5\n\nD\u03bb1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\nD\u03bb2\n.\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\nD\u03bb3\n.\n.\n1\n0\n1\n\nD\u03bb4\n.\n.\n.\n1\n1\n\nD\u03bb5\n.\n.\n.\n.\n1\n\nProof.

Now, by\nCorollary 13(ii), P \u03bb2 has a submodule isomorphic to S \u03bb5 . The composition factors D\u03bb3 and D\u03bb4 of S \u03bb5 cannot appear in Rad P \u03bb2 / Rad2 P \u03bb2 because then D\u03bb5\nwould appear in the head of P \u03bb2 . On the other hand, because S \u03bb2 , S \u03bb3 and S \u03bb4 are\nindecomposable, D\u03bb1 \u2295 D\u03bb3 \u2295 D\u03bb4 appears in Rad P \u03bb2 / Rad2 P \u03bb2 . Recall, again,\nthat P \u03bb2 /S \u03bb5 has a Specht filtration with successive quotients S \u03bb2 , S \u03bb3 and S \u03bb4 .\nTherefore, the H \u2013modules D\u03bb3 and D\u03bb4 which appear in Rad P \u03bb2 / Rad2 P \u03bb2 are\ncomposition factors of S \u03bb3 and S \u03bb4 . Since Rad S \u03bb3 = Rad S \u03bb4 = D\u03bb2 and other D\u03bb2\nare the head and the socle of P \u03bb2 , D\u03bb2 does not appear in Rad P \u03bb2 / Rad2 P \u03bb2 . Thus\nExt1 (D\u03bb2 , D\u03bb2 ) = 0 and we see that P \u03bb2 / Rad3 P \u03bb2 contains D\u03bb2 \u2295 D\u03bb2 as an H \u2013\nsubmodule by the same argument as before. Consequently, EndH (P \u03bb2 / Rad3 P \u03bb2 ) \u223c\n=\nk[x, y]/hx2 , xy, y 2 i and B is of infinite representation type by Lemma 6. Therefore,\nH has infinite representation type by Lemma 5(ii).\nThis completes the proof of Theorem 25.\n\u0003\n6. Finite representation type\nIn this final section we show that Hq (Bn ) is of finite representation type when\nn < min{e, 2f + 4}. To do this we use a different combinatorial description of\nbipartitions which was suggested to the first author by Fomin. Recall that we are\nassuming that q is a primitive eth root of unity in R and that T0 satisfies the relation\n(T0 \u2212 1)(T0 \u2212 q f ) = 0 where 0 \u2264 f \u2264 2e . We note that if K is a field of characteristic\nzero then there is a different argument by Geck [11, Corollary 9.7].\nFirst, consider a partition \u03bb. The diagram of \u03bb is the set\n{ (i, j) \u2208 N2 | 1 \u2264 j \u2264 \u03bbi and i \u2265 1 } ,\nwhich we think of as an array of boxes in the plane. Just as we can identify \u03bb with\nits diagram we can also identify \u03bb with its border\n{ (i, j) \u2208 N2 | \u03bbi < j \u2264 \u03bbi\u22121 + 1 }\n(we set \u03bb0 = \u221e). We can think of the border of \u03bb as a (doubly infinite) path from\n(\u221e, 1) to (1, \u221e). Writing 0 for each vertical edge and 1 for each horizontal edge in\nthe border we identify \u03bb with a doubly infinite sequence of 0's and 1's. We call this\nthe path sequence of \u03bb. A path sequence is also called a Maya diagram.\nFor example, if \u03bb is the partition (4, 2, 1) then by looking at the diagram of \u03bb\n\u00d7 \u00d7\n\u00d7 \u00d7\n\u00d7 0\n0 1\n0\n..\n.\n\n\u00d7 \u00d7\n0 1\n1\n\n0 1\n1\n\n1\n\n...\n\nthe path sequence of \u03bb is . . . 00101011011 . . .. Here the crosses mark the nodes in\nthe diagram of \u03bb and the 0's and 1's are the nodes in the border of \u03bb.\nIn order to keep track of the contents of the nodes we insert a horizontal bar into\nthe path sequence after the node which appears on the diagonal { (i, i) | i \u2208 N }. The\nexample above becomes . . . 00101|011011 . . .. The bar divides the path sequence\ninto two regions which we refer to as the left and right regions of the path.\n\n\fTHE REPRESENTATION TYPE OF HECKE ALGEBRAS OF TYPE B\n\n17\n\nNote that the number of 1's in the left region is always the same as the number\nof 0's in the right region. Conversely, any sequence\n. . . p\u22122 p\u22121 p0 |p1 p2 p3 . . .\nP\nP\nof zeros and ones with P\u2212 = i\u22640 pi < \u221e, P+ = i>0 (1 \u2212 pi ) < \u221e and P\u2212 = P+\nalways corresponds to a partition.\nA rim hook in (the diagram of) \u03bb corresponds to a subsequence 1 . . . 0 in the\npath sequence of \u03bb; explicitly, if x = (i, j) \u2208 [\u03bb] then the rim hook rx corresponds\nto the border path from (\u03bb\u2032j + 1, j + 1) to (i, \u03bbi + 1). As there is a bijection between\nthe nodes and rim hooks of \u03bb, the number of subsequences of a path sequence of the\nform 1 . . . 0 is equal to n. Hence, it follows that removing a rim hook from \u03bb is the\nsame as swapping a 0 and a 1 in the path sequence for \u03bb. Further, the leg length of\nthe hook is equal to the number of zeros in the corresponding 1 . . . 0 subsequence\nminus 1. Conversely, wrapping a rim hook onto \u03bb is the same as changing a 0 . . . 1\nsubsequence to 1 . . . 0. These observations will allow us to rephrase the Jantzen\nsum formula (18) in terms of path sequences.\nGiven p = . . . p\u22122 p\u22121 p0 |p1 p2 p3 . . . letPp = . . . p\u22122 p\u22121 p0 |p1 p2 p3 . . . be the sequence of left partial sums; that is, pi = j\u2264i pi . For example, if \u03bb = (0) then the\npath sequence is 0 = . . . 000|111 . . . and 0 = . . . 000|123 . . . .\nThe content of a node x = (i, j) \u2208 N2 is c(x) = j \u2212 i. For a partition \u03bb\nlet ck (\u03bb) = # { x \u2208 [\u03bb] | c(x) = k }. Using the notation of the last paragraph, if\np = . . . p\u22122 p\u22121 p0 |p1 p2 p3 . . . is the path sequence of \u03bb then the content multiplicities\nck (\u03bb) are given by the sequence . . . c\u22122 c\u22121 c0 |c1 c2 * * * = p \u2212 0.\nWe now turn to path sequences for bipartitions. If \u03bb = (\u03bb(1) , \u03bb(2) ) is a bipartition\nthen we have a path sequence . . . p\u22122 p\u22121 p0 |p1 p2 . . . for \u03bb(1) and a path sequence\n. . . s\u22122 s\u22121 s0 |s1 s2 . . . for \u03bb(2) . Recall that the content of node x = (i, j, k) in [\u03bb] is\ndefined to be c(x) = j \u2212 i + (k \u2212 1)f (and res(x) = c(x) (mod e)). In particular,\np0 corresponds to a node of content 0 and s0 corresponds to a node of content\nf . Accordingly, we shift the nodes in the path sequence for \u03bb(2) by f positions\nto the right and define the path sequence of the bipartition \u03bb to be the sequence\n{(pi , si\u2212f )} of ordered pairs which we write with two separation bars as follows\n. . . p\u22121 p0 p1 . . . pf pf +1 pf +2 . . .\n.\n. . . s\u22121\u2212f s\u2212f s1\u2212f . . . s0 s1 s2 . . .\nWe refer the three regions in the path sequence of a bipartition as the left, middle\nand right regions of the sequence.\n\u0001\nFor example, if \u03bb = (4, 2, 1), (22 , 1) and f = 2 then the contents in \u03bb and its\npath sequence are as follows.\n!\n. . . 000101 01 1011 . . .\n0 1 2 3 , 2 3\n.\nand\n. . . 000001 01 0011 . . .\n\u22121 0\n1 2\n\u22122\n0\nAs before, it isP\neasy to see that we can recover the contents of a bipartition from\nthe partial sums j\u2264i (pj + sj\u2212f ) from the path sequence.\nWe now develop a calculus with which to analyze path sequences of bipartitions.\nLet A = 01 , B = 10 , C = 00 and D = 11 be the four possible ordered pairs which can\nappear in the path sequence of a bipartition. Define al , am and ar to be the number\nof A's in the left, middle and right regions, respectively, of the path sequence;\n\n\f18\n\nSUSUMU ARIKI AND ANDREW MATHAS\n\nsimilarly, we define bl , bm , br , cl , cm , cr , dl , dm and dr . Notice that cl and dr are\nboth infinite; all of the other quantities are non\u2013negative and finite.\n27 Suppose that n \u2264 2f + 3. Then\n(i) bl + dl = am + cm + ar + cr .\n(ii) br + cr = al + dl + am + dm .\n(iii) f = am + bm + cm + dm .\n(iv) 2f + 3 \u2265 (bl + dl )(am + cm + ar + cr ) + (al + dl + am + dm )(br + cr )\n+ (bm + dm )(ar + cr ) + (al + dl )(bm + cm ) + al bl + am bm + ar br .\nProof. Parts (i) and (ii) both follow from the fact mentioned earlier that the number\nof ones in a region to the left of a bar is equal to the number of zeros in the region\nto the right of the same bar. Part (iii) is true by definition. Finally, (iv) follows\nby counting the rim hooks in \u03bb (recall that the rim hooks in the path sequence for\na partition correspond to subsequences of the form 1 . . . 0); this is the only place\nwhere we use the restriction on n.\n\u0003\nWe want to understand this system of inequalities when n \u2264 2f + 3. As a first\nstep, adding parts (i) and (ii) and subtracting (iii) we see that\n(28)\n\nb l + b m + b r = f + al + am + ar .\n\nCareful inspection shows that by combining parts (i), (ii) and (iv) of (27), and\nomitting some terms for the second inequality, we have\n2f + 3 \u2265 (am + cm + ar + cr )2 + (al + dl + am + dm )2 + (bm + dm )ar\n+ (bm + dm )cr + (al + dl )(bm + cm ) + al bl + am bm + ar br\n\u2265 (al + am + ar )(am + bm + cm + dm ) + al am + am ar + a2l + a2m\n+ a2r + al (bl + dl ) + ar (br + cr )\n= (al + am + ar )f + al am + am ar + a2l + a2m + a2r\n+ al (am + cm + ar + cr ) + ar (al + dl + am + dm );\nthe last line again uses (i)\u2013(iii) of (27). Finally, throwing away a few more terms\nand rearranging gives\n2f + 3 \u2265 (al + am + ar )(f + al + am + ar ).\nNow, if al + am + ar \u2265 2 then the right hand side is greater than or equal to 2f + 4;\nas this is impossible we must therefore have\n(29)\n\nal + am + ar \u2264 1.\n\nIn particular, note that at most one of al , am and ar can be non\u2013zero. Notice that\nthis is the first time that the assumption n \u2264 2f + 3 has really been needed; it is\nexactly what is required to ensure that al + am + ar \u2264 1.\nUsing similar arguments it is possible to classify the possible path sequences\nwhen n \u2264 2f + 3; however, we won't need this.\nTheorem 30. Suppose that n < min{e, 2f +4}. Then H is of finite representation\ntype.\nProof. Fix a block B of H and recall from Corollary 20 that two simple modules\nbelong to the same block only if they have a common multiset of residues. Note\nthat because n < e the number of distinct residues contained in the diagram of \u03bb\n\n\fTHE REPRESENTATION TYPE OF HECKE ALGEBRAS OF TYPE B\n\n19\n\nis strictly less than n; consequently, we can find a k, with 0 \u2264 k < e, such that\n\u2212k \u2212 1 (mod e) is not a residue in B.\nSuppose that D\u03bb appears in B. Then the contents of all of the nodes in \u03bb(1) are\ncontained in the interval [\u2212k, e \u2212 k \u2212 1].\nCase 1: Suppose that e\u2212k \u2265 f . As \u2212k \u22121 (mod e) is not a residue for the block B\nthe contents of the nodes in \u03bb(2) are all contained in the interval [\u2212k, e \u2212 k] - note\nthat f \u2208 [\u2212k, e \u2212 k]. Therefore, the multiset of residues for the block B is the same\nas the multiset of contents for B. Consequently, we can unwrap a rim hook from \u03bb\nand wrap it back on again without changing the residue of the foot node only if the\nresulting bipartition \u03bc has the same multiset of contents as \u03bb.\nRecall that unwrapping a rim hook from a partition is the same as swapping\nthe ends of a 1 . . . 0 subsequence to give 0 . . . 1 and that wrapping a hook back on\nchanges some 0 . . . 1 into 1 . . . 0. Now, the contents of a bipartition \u03bb are determined\nby the partial sums in the path sequence of \u03bb; because of this, the only way to\nunwrap a rim hook from \u03bb and then wrap it back on to give a bipartition \u03bc with the\nsame multiset of contents is by interchanging some A and B in the path sequence:\n\u03bb = ...B ...A...\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\n\u03bc = ...A...B ....\n\nMoreover, \u03bb \u22b2 \u03bc if and only if A moves to the left. (Note that |\u03bc| = |\u03bb| in this case\nas the number of 1 . . . 0 subsequences in the two path sequences is the same.)\nIf al + am + ar = 0 then the path sequence for \u03bb does not contain any A's\nso by the sum formula, Theorem 18, and by Proposition 19, the Specht module\nS \u03bb = D\u03bb = P \u03bb is the only simple module in the block B. In particular, B is\nsemisimple and so of finite type in this case.\nIf al + am + ar 6= 0 then al + am + ar = 1 by (29). In this case by Proposition 19\nand (28) the block B contains at most f + 2 bipartitions; namely, the bipartitions\n\u03bb0 , . . . , \u03bbf +1 whose path sequences contain exactly one A and (f +1) B's and which\nagree with the path sequence for \u03bb on all of the C's and D's. By ordering these\nbipartitions according to the location of the (unique) A in their path sequence we\nmay assume that \u03bbf +1 \u22b2 * * * \u22b2 \u03bb0 (for example, A occupies the leftmost position\nin the path sequence of \u03bb0 and the rightmost position in \u03bbf +1 ).\nFor our purposes, it is enough to prove that S \u03bb0 = D\u03bb0 and [S \u03bbi ] = [D\u03bbi ] +\n\u03bbi\u22121\n] for 0 < i \u2264 f ; in particular, we do not need to know that D\u03bbi 6= 0, for\n[D\n0 \u2264 i \u2264 f . In fact these modules are always non\u2013zero; we include the proof below\nbecause it yields the remarkable fact that when n < min{e, 2f + 4} the number of\nSpecht modules belonging to a block is either 1, f + 2 or e \u2212 f + 2.\nThe removable nodes in a partition correspond to the 10 subsequences in the path\n(2)\nsequence. Suppose that 0 \u2264 i \u2264 f . Then \u03bbi contains a removable node x \u2208 [\u03bbi ];\nfurthermore, this node is automatically good because if x is a r\u2013node then there\nis no addable r\u2013node below x because |\u03bb(2) | < e. Let \u03bci be the bipartition with\n[\u03bci ] = [\u03bbi ] \\ {x}. Then \u03bci is Kleshchev because either the path sequence for \u03bci\ncontains an A (so \u03bci is Kleshchev by induction on n), or D\u03bci = S \u03bci 6= 0 (by the\nsecond last paragraph); hence, \u03bbi is Kleshchev. On the other hand, \u03bbf +1 is not\n(1)\nKleshchev because either we can apply induction after removing a node from \u03bbf +1 ,\nor the path sequence for \u03bbf +1 is . . . BBBA . . . in which case it is easy to see\nthat \u03bbf +1 is not Kleshchev.\nNow S \u03bb0 = D\u03bb0 by Theorem 12(iii) since \u03bbi \u22b2 \u03bb0 for i > 0. To complete the\nproof we claim that [S \u03bbi ] = [D\u03bbi ] + [D\u03bbi\u22121 ], for i = 1, . . . , f , and S \u03bbf +1 = D\u03bbf . To\n\n\f20\n\nSUSUMU ARIKI AND ANDREW MATHAS\n\nsee this we apply the sum formula. As discussed earlier, the leg length of a hook\n1 . . . 0 in a path sequence is given by the number of 0's strictly contained in the\nsubsequence. Consequently, when we unwrap the hook B . . . A from \u03bbi and wrap\nit back on to give some \u03bbl then, modulo 2, the difference in the leg lengths of the\ntwo rim hooks is equal to the number of B's which are strictly contained in the\nsubsequence for the rim hook. Therefore, by Theorem 18, for i = 1, . . . , f + 1\nX\n[S \u03bbi (j)] = [S \u03bbi\u22121 ] \u2212 [S \u03bbi\u22122 ] + * * * + (\u22121)i\u22121 [S \u03bb0 ].\nj>0\n\nAs we already know that \u03bb0 , . . . \u03bbf are Kleshchev, and that \u03bbf +1 is not, our claim\nnow follows by induction on i. Consequently, the decomposition matrix of the\nblock B is\nD\u03bb0 D\u03bb1 . . . D\u03bbf\n\u03bb0\nS\n1\nS \u03bb1\n1\n1\n..\n..\n..\n.\n.\n.\n\n1\n1\nS \u03bbf\nS \u03bbf +1\n1\nand B has finite representation type by Theorem 9.\nCase 2: Suppose that 0 < e \u2212 k < f .\nIn this case the contents of the nodes\nin \u03bb(2) are contained in the interval [e \u2212 k, 2e \u2212 k \u2212 1]. Renormalizing T0 as q f T0\nthe relation for T0 becomes (T0 \u2212 1)(T0 \u2212 q e\u2212f ) = 0. The Specht module S \u03bb is\n(2)\n(1)\nrelabelled as S (\u03bb ,\u03bb ) and the residues in [\u03bb] are all changed by adding e \u2212 f \u2261\n\u2212f (mod e). Consequently, the residues for \u03bb are all contained in the interval\n[e \u2212 f \u2212 k, 2e \u2212 f \u2212 k \u2212 1]. Therefore, with this renormalization, the multiset of\nresidues for B is the same as the multiset of contents for B. Consequently, we can\nrepeat the argument of Case 1 to deduce that decomposition matrix for B has the\nform above; so, again, B has finite representation type by Theorem 9.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] S.
