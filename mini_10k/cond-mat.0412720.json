With\nthese systems one comes across the interesting possibility of influencing the propagation of\nelectromagnetic wave by creating gaps in the band structure of synthetic periodic dielectric\nstructures [4]. Such studies constitute an important part of mesoscopic physics, which focus\non the possibility of localization of light [5, 6], a direct evidence of which has already been\nreported for a strongly scattering media of semiconductor powders [7].\nNetworks formed by segments of one dimensional waveguides provide examples of an\nalternative class of PBG systems which do not require a material with large dielectric constant. Zhang et al [8] have experimentally observed Anderson localization of light in a three\ndimensional network, composed of coaxial cables which played the role of a practically one\n\n\f1\ndimensional waveguide. Vasseur et al [9] have investigated the photonic band structure of\na comb-like waveguide geometry composed of dangling side branches grafted periodically\nalong a mono-mode waveguide. Their work represents a one dimensional photonic crystal\nenabling one to investigate the occurrence of localized states in such systems. The network\nsystem is capable of producing large gaps even in one dimension, though it may be sensitive\nto the structure of the unit cell.\nRecently, network models based on serial loop structures (SLS) are being studied in the\ncontext of propagation of electromagnetic and acoustic waves [10, 11]. Experiment has been\ndone [10] on systems consisting of loop structure made by slender tubes which are pasted\non similar tubes of finite length. These circuits allow the propagation of electromagnetic or\nacoustic wave through practically a single channel. A theory for one dimensional network\nthus becomes relevant. However, the results presented so far mainly deal with periodic\nsystems, and the influence of a variation from periodicity in the geometry of the network on\nthe transport of classical waves practically remains unaddressed.\nMotivated by this observation, we undertake a systematic investigation of the transmission of classical waves through a quasi-periodically ordered Fibonacci SLS. We use a model\nproposed initially by Zhang and Sheng [12] to examine wave propagation in a random array\nof waveguide segments in the form of loops. Two consecutive loops join each other at a\nnode. Scattering occurs only at the nodes, each pair of which holds an arbitrary number\nof segments between them. A one dimensional Fibonacci lattice with the golden mean irrationality is already known to exhibit a purely singular continuous spectrum, free from the\nexistence of any extended wave function [13]. The interplay of quasi-periodic order and the\nnumber of waveguide segments between the consecutive nodes (each segment providing a\npropagating channel) in a closed loop geometry is likely to produce interesting transmission characteristics, which is the prime objective of the present study. Secondly, whether\nextended modes of classical wave propagation in a quasi-periodic geometry exists, is yet to\nbe known, to the best of our knowledge. Such extended states do exist [14] for an electron\ntraveling through a certain group of quasi-periodic lattices as well as in random lattices\n\n\f2\nwith correlated disorder [15, 16], where one identifies local clusters of atomic sites, causing\nresonance and extended wave-function. However, delocalized eigenmodes in the context of\nquantum transport does not occur in a golden mean Fibonacci chain. It is therefore, interesting to see whether, multiple loops have any role to play in this regard, in the case of\nclassical wave propagation.\nWe find that the band structure of an array of Fibonacci SLS has a strong dependence\non the number of waveguide segments between consecutive nodes, which is reflected in the\ntransmission coefficient across a finite Fibonacci SLS. We have also been able to identify\nlocal clusters in a Fibonacci SLS, which are responsible for producing resonance leading\nto finite transmission. The transmission coefficient, at special values of the wave-vector\nexhibits cyclic variation as a function of the system size. The intensity distribution at the\nnodes corresponding to such cases may exhibit a completely periodic pattern, or a selfsimilar (fractal) pattern depending on the mutual relationship between the lengths and\nthe numbers of the waveguide segments in the two basic loop structures constituting the\nFibonacci geometry.\nIn what follows, we describe our model, method and the results. A comparison with the\ncorresponding periodic system is made wherever necessary. The formulation remains valid\nwhether we have an electromagnetic wave or sound wave propagating through the network.\n\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL AND THE METHOD\n\nFollowing Zhang and Sheng [12] we consider a network formed by waveguide segments of\nflexible length joining together to form a Fibonacci sequence of loops A and B [Fig.1(a)]. A\nbinary Fibonacci sequence is generated from a seed A, by using the inflation rule, A \u2192 AB\nand B \u2192 A [13]. The 'wave-function' \u03c8i,i+1 within any segment of length li,i+1 between the\nnodes i and i + 1 is given by [12],\n\u03c8i,i+1 (x) = \u03c8i\n\nsin kx\nsin[k(li,i+1 \u2212 x)]\n+ \u03c8i+1\nsin kli,i+1\nsin kli,i+1\n\n(1)\n\n\f3\nwhere, \u03c8i is the amplitude at the ith mode, and k is the absolute value of the wave vector\nin the loop. For example, for an electromagnetic wave, k =\n\n\u221a\ni\u03c9 \u01eb\nc0\n\nwhere \u03c9 and c0 are the\n\nfrequency and the speed (in vacuum) of the electromagnetic wave respectively. \u01eb is the\nrelative permittivity of the dielectric medium, which we may assume to be real. A complex\ndielectric constant can easily be dealt with. The continuity of the wave function at the nodes\nand the flux conservation criterion are used to map the problem of wave propagation in such\nloops into an equivalent tight binding problem of electron propagation on a one dimension\nlattice [12]. The resulting difference equation is,\n(E \u2212 \u01ebi )\u03c8i = ti,i+1 \u03c8i+1 + ti\u22121,i \u03c8i\u22121\n\n(2)\n\nwhere, we parametrize E = 2 cos kli,i+1 and, define the effective on-site potential\nNi,i\u22121\n\n\u01ebi = 2 cos(kli,i+1 ) +\n\nX\n\nNi,i+1\n(m)\ncot \u03b8i\u22121,i\n\n+\n\nm=1\n\nX\n\n(m)\n\ncot \u03b8i,i+1\n\n(3)\n\nm=1\n\nThe effective nearest neighbour 'hopping integral' is given by,\nNi,i+1\n\nti,i+1 =\n\nX\n\nm=1\n\n1\n\n(4)\n\n(m)\n\nsin \u03b8i,i+1\n(m)\n\n(m)\n\nHere, Ni,i\u00b11 is the number of segments between the nodes i and i \u00b1 1. \u03b8i,i+1 = kli,i+1 is\nthe corresponding phase acquired in the mth segment. The problem of wave propagation\nnow becomes mathematically equivalent to the problem of transmission of an electron with\nenergy E through the mapped lattice, where, \u22122 \u2264 E \u2264 2. The set of equations (2) is\nconveniently cast into a matrix form,\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\u03c8\n\u03c8\n\uf8ed i+1 \uf8f8 = M i \uf8ed i \uf8f8\n\u03c8i\n\u03c8i\u22121\n\n(5)\n\nwhere,\n\uf8eb\n\nMi = \uf8ed\n\nE\u2212\u01ebi\nti,i+1\n\nt\n\u2212 ti,i\u22121\ni,i+1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\nis called the 'transfer matrix'.\nIn a Fibonacci SLS of two loops A and B, the loops may differ from each other either\nin terms of the lengths of the segments, or, in the number of segments, or in both. Using\n\n\f4\nthe language of electron propagation, on the mapped lattice, which now becomes a one\ndimensional Fibonacci chain, the 'on-site potentials' [13] assume three distinct values (in\nrespect of the nearest neighbour loops), viz,\n\u01eb\u03b1 = 2 cos \u03b81 + m[cot \u03b81 + cot \u03b82 ]\n\u01eb\u03b2 = 2 cos \u03b81 + m[cot \u03b81 + cot \u03b82 ] + n[cot \u03b83 + cot \u03b84 ]\n\u01eb\u03b3 = \u01eb\u03b2\n\n(6)\n\nThere are two kinds of 'hopping integrals' tL and tS for the equivalent electron problem\nwhich are arranged accordingly to the Fibonacci sequence. These are given by,\nm\nm\n+\nsin \u03b81 sin \u03b82\nn\nn\n+\n=\nsin \u03b83 sin \u03b84\n\ntL =\ntS\n\n(7)\n\nHere, we have assumed that the A-loop has m segments of length a1 in the 'upper' branch,\nand m segments of length a2 in the 'lower' branch. The B-loop has n segments in both\nbranches, the lengths being a3 and a4 for the upper and the lower branches respectively, and\n\u03b8j = kaj with aj = a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 . The asymmetrical Fibonacci SLS can thus be easily studied.\nOn the equivalent one-dimensional lattice [Fig.1(b)], we define three transfer matrices, viz\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\nE\u2212\u01eb\u03b2\nE\u2212\u01eb\u03b3\ntL\ntS\nE\u2212\u01eb\u03b1\n\u22121\n\u2212 tS\n\u2212 tL\n\uf8f8 ; M \u03b2 \uf8ed tS\n\uf8f8 ; M \u03b3 \uf8ed tL\n\uf8f8\nM \u03b1 \uf8ed tL\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\ncorresponding to the sites \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 respectively [13]. We have examined the spectral\nproperties of both the infinite and the finite Fibonacci SLS for various combinations of m,\nn and aj 's. The fundamental features that we propose to investigate are revealed even if we\nkeep all the lengths identical. Therefore, without losing any generality we stick to the case\nwhere a1 = a2 = a3 = a4 = a and present the results in the following section.\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nA.\n\nBand Structure\n\nThe first few generation in a Fibonacci sequence of A and B are as follows: S1 = A;\nS2 = AB; S3 = ABA; S4 = ABAAB and so on.

The smallest resonating clusters \u03b2\u03b3 and \u03b1 have been marked.\n\nA and B (or of tL and tS ) may be recursively generated by periodically repeating rational\napproximants of increasing size. By noting the individual sites (in terms of the equivalent\none-dimensional chain), one can calculate the product transfer matrix across an lth generation Fibonacci rational approximant. The condition for a certain k-value to be an \"allowed\"\none is, given by | xl |\u2264 1, where, xl = 12 T rMl [13], Ml being the transfer matrix for the\nlth generation Fibonacci lattice, and satisfies the recursion relation Ml = Ml\u22122 Ml\u22121 with\nM1 = M\u03b1 and M2 = M\u03b3\u03b2 = M\u03b3 M\u03b2 . The relation between xl 's is,\nxl = xl\u22122 xl\u22121 \u2212 xl\u22123 , l \u2265 4\nThis is called the 'trace map'. Using the trace-map method [13] we have studied the distribution of the allowed values of the wave-vector k as a function of \u2206m = m \u2212 n keeping the\nlengths of all the segments in each of the loops A and B equal. For this we have selected\nan arbitrary rational approximant of a Fibonacci lattice, which consists of 55 loops. The\ncase \u2206m = 0 corresponds to the perfectly periodic arrangement of identical loops, for which\nwe have a continuous distribution of \"allowed\" eigenvalues from k = 0 to 2\u03c0 (as we have\nshown) with a = 1 in arbitrary units. With n = 1 [Fig.2(a)] the spectrum starts splitting\ninto three major sub-bands, with a couple of minor clusters of allowed k-values peeping\n\n\f6\n\n6\n\nk\n\n(a)\n\n3\n\n0\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\u2206m\n\n75\n\n6\n\n100\n\nk\n\n(b)\n\n3\n\n0\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\u2206m\n\n75\n\n100\n\n\f7\nin between the major sub-bands. These clusters do not grow when \u2206m exceeds a certain\nvalue. Each major sub-band gets split up, exhibiting a fragmented structure as m increases\nkeeping n fixed at 1. However, when \u2206m becomes quite large, the further fragmentation of\nthe major sub-bands becomes hard to detect numerically. The features are sensitive to the\nstarting value of n. Fig.2(b) shows the band structure, where the number of segments in\nthe B-loop is 2n = 10. Here, the minor (weak) sub-clusters around k = 1.5 and k close to\n5 grow in width, as well as in length. With increasing values of n the spectrum assumes a\nvery prominent four-sub-band structure. The self-similar splitting of the spectrum is there\nas \u2206m increases, which of course is limited by the resolution of the machine as \u2206m increases\nto large enough values.\n\nB.\n\nTransmission coefficient\n\nFor computation of the transmission coefficient, we adopt the widely used technique [17]\nof fixing semi-infinite leads to the extreme nodes of the equivalent one-dimensional Fibonacci\nlattice obtained by discretizing the wave equation. The lead is described by identical and\nequispaced sites with on-site potential \u01eb0 , set equal to zero and connected to each other via\nnearest neighbour hopping integral t0 , which we set equal to unity. An equivalent problem of\nan electron with energy E = 2 cos ka (in unit of t0 ) travelling along such a lead and entering\nthe finite sized sample will give us the transmittance of the actual problem of classical waves\npropagating through the Fibonacci SLS. Following Ref. [17] the transmission coefficient of\na finite equivalent one-dimensional Fibonacci segment consisting of sites \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 and\nhopping integrals tL , tS is given by,\nT =\nwhere P =\n\nQ\n\ni\n\n4 sin2 \u03b8\n[(P12 \u2212 P21 + (P11 \u2212 P22 ) cos \u03b8)2 + (P11 + P22 )2 sin2 \u03b8]\n\n(8)\n\nMi . Mi are the transfer matrices corresponding to each site (including the\n\nboundary sites) in the equivalent chain that is clamped between the leads. Here \u03b8 = ka. We\nhave used the formulation first to get an idea of wave propagation through a periodic array\nof N identical loops, each consisting of the same 'm' number of segments of equal length.\n\n\f8\nThe transmission coefficient for N such loops in periodic arrangement turns out to be,\nT =\n\n16m2 sin2 \u03b8\n[2m(UN \u22122 (x) \u2212 UN (x)) +\n\n(1\u22124m2 )\n2\n\nUN \u22121 (x) sin 2\u03b8]2 + (1 + 4m2 )2 UN2 \u22121 (x) sin4 \u03b8\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere, UN (x) is the Nth order Chebyshev polynomial of second kind, a = a1 = a2 = a3 = a4\nand x = \u2212 cos ka = \u2212 cos \u03b8.\nIn Fig.3 we plot the transmission coefficient for periodic array of 55 identical loops. It\nis interesting to see that in the present model the loops touch each other, and there is no\nreal gap opening up in the spectrum, except for the isolated zeroes at ka = 0, \u03c0, 2\u03c0, ..... The\nenvelope of the values of T between consecutive zeroes can be worked out from (9) to drop\nfollowing a power law, viz, T \u223c\n\n1\nm2\n\nwith increasing values of m, when m is large.\n\nThe calculation of transmission coefficient for a Fibonacci array of two different loops\nbrings out an interesting difference. Fig.4 shows the transmission coefficient against the\nwave-vector for a 9th generation Fibonacci sequence of 55 loops. The loops differ only in\nthe values of the number of waveguide segments m and n, n being fixed at 1. We have kept\na1 = a2 = a3 = a4 = a as before, and results are shown for 0 \u2264 ka \u2264 2\u03c0 with m = 2\n[Fig.4(a)]. The corresponding lengths of the wave-guide segments with frequency range for\nan electromagnetic wave for example, can easily be extracted to design a possible network\nfor the light localization in a quasi-periodic network. The gaps in the spectrum are quite\nclear. With m taking up values 4 [Fig.4(b)] and 6 [Fig.4(c)], the gaps clearly widen and the\ntransmission spectrum exhibits a global three sub-band structure. It should be appreciated\nthat the transmission spectrum is sensitive to the absolute values of the parameters of the\nsystem. For example, in any given generation, by increasing the lengths of the segments for\nany loop A, or B, or by increasing the value of n for a fixed m (> n) one finds the growth\nof new sub-bands in the transmission characteristics. However, the additional sub-bands\ndisappear when one increases the difference between m and n appreciably.\nFor certain values of the wave-vector, appropriate choice of the lengths of the segments\nmay lead to interesting fluctuations in the transmission spectrum. This behaviour is, however, sensitive to the number of A and B loops in the Fibonacci array. To clarify, let us\n\n\f9\n\n1\n\nT\n\n(a)\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nka\n1\n\nT\n\n(b)\n0.5\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nka\n1\n\nT\n\n(c)\n0.5\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\nka\n\n6\n\n\f10\n\n1\n(a)\n0.8\n\nT\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nka\n1\n(b)\n0.8\n\nT\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nka\n1\n(c)\n0.8\n\nT\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\nka\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n\f11\ndefine \u03b8j = kaj , j =1,2,3 and 4. It is simple to work out that, for \u03b81 =\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\nand \u03b83 = \u03c06 , with\n\n\u03b81 + \u03b82 = (2p + 1)\u03c0 and \u03b83 + \u03b84 = (2q + 1)\u03c0, p and q being integers, each of the transfer\nmatrices M\u03b1 , M\u03b2 and M\u03b3 becomes equal to \u2212i\u03c3y , provided one adjusts m and n such that,\nm sin \u03b83 = n sin \u03b81 .\n\n(10)\n\nIn the equivalent electron problem we now have E = 2 cos \u03b81 = 0 and \u01ebi = 0 with tL = tS . It\nimplies that the equivalent one-dimensional chain becomes indistinguishable from a perfectly\nordered chain of pseudo-atoms. In this situation, a straightforward calculation shows that,\na Fibonacci array of loops at the 3l and (3l + 1)th generation, with l \u2265 1, will exhibit a\n\n1\nm2\n\ndecay in the transmission coefficient. For all other generations, with the above specification\nof parameters, we get T = 1.\n\nC.\n\nDimer like correlations and resonance\n\nLooking at the equivalent one dimensional Fibonacci chain (Fig.1b), we find that the\ncluster \u03b2\u03b3 (put in a box) appears in pairs, as well as in isolation. The site \u03b1 (put in a circle)\nhowever, is always single. The \u03b2\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b2\u03b3 pairs, whenever they appear, are always flanked by\ntwo \u03b1 sites. Now, if the traces of the 2 \u00d7 2 transfer matrices M\u03b3\u03b2 and M\u03b1 can be made\nto vanish simultaneously for a certain combination of the system-parameters and the wave\nvector, then the cluster \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 \u2212 \u03b1 will contribute an identity matrix to the\nentire product of the transfer matrices at any given generation of the Fibonacci chain [18].\nThis leads to a resonance in the above cluster. As has been explained elsewhere [18], such\nresonance then takes place locally throughout the chain, reducing the long product of transfer\nmatrices, viz, Ml+6 to Ml for l \u2265 1. This also explains the six cyclic invariance of the transfer\nmatrices in a Fibonacci chain [18]. However, the sizes of the minimal clusters responsible for\nresonance depend on the choice of the wave vector, and definitely, on the combination of the\nother parameters of the system. To clarify, we work out a specific example. Let us select,\n\u03b81 + \u03b82 = (2p + 1)\u03c0 and \u03b83 + \u03b84 = (2l + 1)\u03c0, p and q being integers, equal or unequal. This\nchoice automatically ensures \u01eb\u03b1 = \u01eb\u03b2 = \u01eb\u03b3 = E and a six-cycle of the transfer matrices for all\nk-values consistent with the above conditions for any suitable combination of the ai 's [18].\n\n\f12\n\n1.2\n(a)\n\n|\u03c8|\n\n2\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nNODE\n\n4\n(b)\n\n|\u03c8|\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\nNODE\n\n150\n\n200\n\n\f13\nIn particular, when the special condition (10) is satisfied, it is simple to check that tL = tS\n2\nand M\u03b1 = M\u03b2 = M\u03b3 = \u2212i\u03c3y . The products M\u03b3\u03b2\n= M\u03b12 = \u2212I, and the resonance condition,\n\nas discussed above, is trivially satisfied. With \u03b2\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b2\u03b3 and \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1 playing the roles of the\nminimal clusters responsible for resonance. Otherwise, if m sin \u03b83 6= n sin \u03b81 i.e. tL 6= tS , we\nget back the well known pure transfer model of a Fibonacci chain [13] with E = 2 cos \u03b81 at its\nband-centre. Again, a six-cycle wave-function results, and the intensity | \u03c8i |2 has a purely\nmulti-fractal character [13]. The multifractality can be removed by controlling the values of\nm and n. For example, with ka1 =\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\nm\nand ka3 = \u03c06 , we get tL = tS 2n\n. So, m = 2n makes the\n\nequivalent one-dimensional lattice completely periodic. | \u03c8i |2 is also periodic in this case,\nthough the loops are arranged in a Fibonacci sequence. We get an extended eigenmode. For\nall other cases with m = 2n, the transfer model, and hence the fractal nature of | \u03c8i |2 at\nthe nodes is restored. This feature is illustrated in Fig.5.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe investigate the propagation of classical waves in a Fibonacci array of waveguide\nnetwork. For specific considerations of the system parameters one can have extended, nonfractal wave function is the system, contrary to the quantum counterpart of the problem.\nResonant transmission in such network can be attributed dimer-like correlation in the placement of the loops. The study shows that one can design such a network as an example of\nquasi-periodic photonic band gap system.\n\nV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nAC thanks CSIR, India for financial assistance through grant no. 03(0944)/02/EMR-II.\n\n[1] see for example, Photonic band gap materials, edited by C.
