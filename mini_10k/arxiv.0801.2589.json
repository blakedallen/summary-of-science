The proper motion and an initial estimate of the parallax were\nlater presented along with evidence for secular change in the inclination angle of the orbit due\nto proper motion (Sandhu et al. 1997). Using high time resolution instrumentation, the\nthree-dimensional orbital geometry of the binary system was determined, enabling a new\ntest of general relativity (GR; van Straten et al. 2001). Most recently, multi-frequency\nobservations were used to compute the dispersion measure structure function (You et al.\n2007), quantifying the turbulent character of the interstellar medium towards this pulsar.\nThe high proper motion and proximity of PSR J0437\u22124715 led to the prediction (Bell & Bailes\n1996) that a distance measurement independent of parallax would be available within a\ndecade, when the orbital period derivative (P \u0307b ) would be determined to high accuracy. Even\nif the predicted precision of \u223c1% would not be achieved, such a measurement would be significant given the strong dependence of most methods of distance determination on relatively\npoorly constrained models and the typically large errors on parallax measurements. Even\nfor nearby stars, both the Hubble Space Telescope and the Hipparcos satellite give typical\ndistance errors of 3% (Valls-Gabaud 2007) and so far only two distances beyond 100 pc have\nbeen determined at \u223c 1% uncertainty (Torres et al. 2007). This kinematic distance is one\nof the few model-independent methods that does not rely upon the motion of the Earth\naround the Sun.\nAs demonstrated by Damour & Taylor (1991), P \u0307b can also be used to constrain the\nvariation of Newton's gravitational constant. The best such limit from pulsar timing to\ndate (Taylor 1993, |\u0120/G| = (4 \u00b1 5) \u00d7 10\u221212 yr\u22121 from PSR B1913+16) is compromised\ndue to the poorly constrained equation of state for the neutron star companion (Nordtvedt\n1990). The slightly weaker but more reliable limit of |\u0120/G| = (\u22129 \u00b1 18) \u00d7 10\u221212 yr\u22121\n(Kaspi, Taylor & Ryba 1994, from PSR B1855+09, which has a white dwarf companion)\nshould therefore be considered instead. A more stringent limit can be obtained from the\nSplaver et al. (2005) timing of PSR J1713+0747: |\u0120/G| = (2.5 \u00b1 3.3) \u00d7 10\u221212 yr \u22121 (at 95%\ncertainty). This limit is, however, based upon the formal errors of P \u0307b , Pb and parallax, which\nare easily underestimated by standard methodologies, as we shall demonstrate later. Because\nof this we believe the Splaver et al. (2005) limit is probably underestimated, but still of\nrelevance. However, none of these limits are as strong as that put by lunar laser ranging\n(LLR; Williams, Turyshev & Boggs 2004): \u0120/G = (4 \u00b1 9) \u00d7 10\u221213 yr\u22121 . Besides limiting\nalternative theories of gravity, bounds on \u0120 can also be used to constrain variations of the\nAstronomical Unit (AU). Current planetary radar experiments (Krasinsky & Brumberg\n2004) have measured a significant linear increase of dAU/dt = 0.15 \u00b1 0.04 m yr\u22121 , which\nmay imply \u0120/G = (\u221210 \u00b1 3) \u00d7 10\u221213 yr\u22121 , just beyond the sensitivity of the limits listed\nabove.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nAs mentioned before, the equation of state for dense neutron star matter is very poorly\nconstrained. Pulsar mass determinations can probe the range of permissible pulsar masses\nand thereby limit possible equations of state (Lattimer & Prakash 2007). Presently, only\nthe pulsars NGC 6440B, Terzan 5 I and Terzan 5 J have predicted masses higher than the\ntypical value of 1.4 M\u2299 (Freire et al. 2007; Ransom et al. 2005); however, as discussed in\nmore detail in Section 5, such predictions do not represent objective mass estimates.\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the observations, data analysis and general timing solution for PSR J0437\u22124715. Section 3 describes\nhow the measurement of P \u0307b leads to a new and highly precise distance. In Section 4, this\nmeasurement is combined with the parallax distance to derive limits on \u0120 and the Solar\nSystem acceleration. Section 5 presents the newly revised pulsar mass and our conclusions\nare summarised in Section 6.\n\n2.\n\nObservations and Data Reduction\n\nObservations of PSR J0437\u22124715 were made over a time span of ten years (see Figure\n1), using the Parkes 64-m radio telescope, two 20 cm receiving systems (the central beam\nof the Parkes multi-beam receiver (Staveley-Smith et al. 1996) and the H-OH receiver)\nand four generations of digital instrumentation (see Table 1): the Fast Pulsar Timing Machine (FPTM), the S2 VLBI recorder, and the Caltech-Parkes-Swinburne Recorders (CPSR\nand CPSR2). The FPTM is an autocorrelation spectrometer, whereas the three other instruments are baseband data recording and processing systems that employ phase-coherent\ndispersion removal.\n\n2.1.\n\nArrival Time Estimation\n\nFor the FPTM, S2, and CPSR backends, the uncalibrated polarization data were combined to form the polarimetric invariant interval (Britton 2000) and each observation was\nintegrated in time and frequency before pulse arrival times were calculated through standard cross-correlation with an instrument-dependent template profile. For the CPSR2 data,\nthe technique described by van Straten (2004) was used to calibrate 5 days of intensive\nPSR J0437\u22124715 observations made on 2003 July 19 to 21, 2003 August 29, and 2005 July\n24. The calibrated data were integrated to form a polarimetric template profile with an integration length of approximately 40 hours and frequency resolution of 500 kHz. This template\nprofile and Matrix Template Matching (MTM, van Straten 2006) were used to calibrate the\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nthree years of CPSR2 data. An independent MTM fit was performed on each five-minute\nintegration, producing a unique solution in each frequency channel, as shown in Figure 2\nof van Straten (2006). The calibrated data were then integrated in frequency to produce a\nsingle full-polarization profile at each epoch. MTM was then used to derive time-of-arrival\n(TOA) estimates from each calibrated, five-minute integration. The application of MTM\nduring the calibration and timing stages reduced the weighted rms of the CPSR2 post-fit\ntiming residuals by a factor of two. All the data reduction described above was performed\nusing the psrchive software package (Hotan, van Straten & Manchester 2004).\n\n2.2.\n\nTiming Analysis\n\nMost data were recorded at a wavelength of 20 cm; however, in the final three years,\nsimultaneous observations at 10 and 50 cm were used to measure temporal variations of\nthe interstellar dispersion delay (corrections for these variations were implemented in a way\nsimilar to that of You et al. 2007). A linear trend of these delays was also obtained for the\nyear of FPTM data, using data at slightly different frequencies close to 1400 MHz.\nThe arrival times were analyzed using the Tempo2 pulsar timing software package\n(Hobbs, Edwards & Manchester 2006; Edwards, Hobbs & Manchester 2006) and consistency with the earlier program, Tempo, was verified. The timing model (see Table 2)\nis based on the relativistic binary model first derived by Damour & Deruelle (1986), and\nexpanded to contain the geometric orbital terms described by Kopeikin (1995, 1996). The\nmodel is optimised through a standard weighted least-squares fit in which all parameters\nare allowed to vary, including the unknown time delays between data from different instruments, but excluding the mean value of dispersion measure, which is determined from the\nsimultaneous CPSR2, 64 MHz-wide bands centred at 1341 and 1405 MHz.\nA major difference between our implementation of solutions for the orbital angles \u03a9 and i\nand previous efforts (van Straten et al. 2001; Hotan, Bailes & Ord 2006) is that they were\nimplemented as part of the standard fitting routine. This ensures any covariances between\nthese and other parameters (most importantly the periastron advance and companion mass,\nsee Table 2 and Section 5) are properly accounted for, thereby yielding a more reliable\nmeasurement error. The previous works mentioned above derived these effects from an\nindependent mapping of \u03c72 space, leaving the errors of other parameters unaffected.\nAs can be seen from Figure 1, there are significant low-frequency structures present in\nthe timing residual data. Since the standard least-squares fitting routine used in Tempo2\ndoes not account for the effect of such correlations on parameter estimation, we performed a\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nMonte-Carlo simulation where data sets with a post-fit power spectrum statistically consistent with that of the PSR J0437\u22124715 data were used to determine the parameter estimations uncertainties in the presence of realistic low frequency noise. These errors, as well as\nthe factors by which the original errors were underestimated, are shown in Table 2. As an\nexample, the distribution of derived pulsar masses from the Monte-Carlo simulation is given\nin Figure 2. Because of the dispersion measure corrections implemented in the final three\nyears of data, one can expect the spectrum of these most precise data points to contain less\nlow-frequency noise than the ten year data set as a whole. We therefore expect the errors\nresulting from this analysis to be slightly overestimated. Ongoing research into extending\nthe fitting routine with reliable whitening schemes to avoid the spectral leakage and hence\nimprove the reliability of the measured parameters, is expected to reduce these errors by factors of around two. All errors given in this paper are those resulting from the Monte-Carlo\nsimulations, unless otherwise stated. The simulations also showed that any biases resulting\nfrom the red noise are statistically negligible for the reported parameters. (A full description\nof this Monte-Carlo technique and the whitening schemes mentioned will be detailed in a\nfuture publication.)\n\n2.3.\n\nSolar System Ephemerides\n\nPulsar timing results are dependent on accurate ephemerides for the Solar System bodies. The results presented in this paper were obtained using the DE405 model (Standish\n2004) and, for comparison, selected parameters obtained with the earlier DE200 model\nare shown in Table 3. The greatly reduced \u03c72 indicates that the newer Solar System\nephemerides are superior to the earlier DE200, reinforcing similar conclusions of other authors\n(Splaver et al. 2005; Hotan, Bailes & Ord 2006). We notice the parallax value changes by\nmore than 10 \u03c3, and that the different derived values are closely correlated with the ephemeris\nused. Although the effect is not as dramatic as it appears because of the under-estimation\nof the Tempo2 errors, the fact that the DE405 results agree much better with the more\naccurate kinematic distance (discussed in the next Section), strongly suggests that the differences are due to the ephemeris used and confirms that the DE405 ephemeris is superior.\nFinally, we note that the DE405 measurement of \u03c9\u0307 (0.016 \u00b1 0.008 \u25e6yr\u22121 ) is consistent with\nthe GR prediction for this system (0.0172 \u00b1 0.0009 \u25e6yr\u22121 ).\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n3.\n\nKinematic Distance\n\nAs shown in Figure 3, the long-term timing history enables precise measurement of\nthe orbital period derivative, P \u0307b = (3.73 \u00b1 0.06) \u00d7 10\u221212 . This observed value represents a\ncombination of phenomena that are intrinsic to the binary system and dynamical effects that\nresult in both real and apparent accelerations of the binary system along the line of sight\n(Bell & Bailes 1996); i.e.\n\u1e56bobs = \u1e56bint + \u1e56bGal + \u1e56bkin\n(1)\nwhere \"obs\" and \"int\" refer to the observed and intrinsic values; \"Gal\" and \"kin\" are the\nGalactic and kinematic contributions.\nIntrinsic orbital decay is a result of energy loss typically due to effects such as atmospheric drag and tidal dissipation; however, in a neutron star\u2013white dwarf binary system\nlike PSR J0437\u22124715, energy loss is dominated by quadrupolar gravitational wave emission.\nFor this system, GR predicts (Taylor & Weisberg 1982) \u1e56bGR = \u22124.2 \u00d7 10\u221216 , two orders of\nmagnitude smaller than the uncertainty in the measured value of P \u0307b .\nGalactic contributions to the observed orbital period derivative include differential rotation and gravitational acceleration (Damour & Taylor 1991). The differential rotation in\nthe plane of the Galaxy is estimated from the Galactic longitude of the pulsar and the Galactocentric distance and circular velocity of the Sun. Acceleration in the Galactic gravitational\npotential varies as a function of height above the Galactic plane (Holmberg & Flynn 2004),\nwhich may be estimated using the parallax distance and the Galactic latitude of the pulsar.\nCombining these terms gives \u1e56bGal = (\u22121.8 \u2212 0.5) \u00d7 10\u221214 = \u22122.3 \u00d7 10\u221214 , which is of the\nsame order as the current measurement error.\nGiven the negligible intrinsic contribution, Equation 1 can be simplified and rewritten\nin terms of the dominant kinematic contribution known as the Shklovskii effect (Shklovskii\n1970), an apparent acceleration resulting from the non-linear increase in radial distance as\nthe pulsar moves across the plane perpendicular to the line of sight; quantified by the proper\nmotion, \u03bc, and distance D from the Earth:\n\u1e56bobs \u2212 \u1e56bGal \u2243 \u1e56bkin =\n\n\u03bc2 D\nPb ,\nc\n\n(2)\n\nwhere c is the vacuum speed of light. Using the measured values of \u03bc, Pb , and P \u0307b , Equation\n2 is used to derive the kinematic distance (Bell & Bailes 1996): Dk = 157.0 \u00b1 2.4 pc.\nThis distance is consistent with the one derived from parallax (D\u03c0 = 150 \u00b1 12 pc \u2013 see\nalso Figure 4) and is, with a relative error of 1.5%, comparable in precision to the best\nparallax measurements from VLBI (Torres et al. 2007) and better than typical relative\nerrors provided by the Hipparcos and Hubble space telescopes (Valls-Gabaud 2007).\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nGiven the dependence of parallax distances on ephemerides, as described in Section 2.3,\nit is interesting to note the robustness of Dk . Also, Table 2 shows that the presence of red\nnoise corrupts the parallax error by a factor of 7.9, whereas P \u0307b is only affected by a factor\nof 2.5. These facts clearly indicate the higher reliability of Dk as compared to D\u03c0 .\n\n4.\n\nLimits on P \u0307b Anomalies: \u0120 and the Acceleration of the Solar System\n\nAny anomalous orbital period derivative can be constrained by substituting the parallax\ndistance into Equation 2, yielding\n\u0010 \u1e56 \u0011excess\nb\n\nPb\n\n= (\u1e56bobs \u2212 \u1e56bGal \u2212 \u1e56bkin )/Pb\n= (3.2 \u00b1 5.7) \u00d7 10\u221219 s\u22121 .\n\n(3)\n\nin which the error is almost exclusively due to the parallax uncertainty. Following Damour & Taylor\n(1991), this can be translated into a limit on the time derivative of Newton's gravitational\nconstant (given are 95% confidence levels):\n\u0120\n1 \u0010 P \u0307b \u0011excess\n=\u2212\n= (\u22125 \u00b1 18) \u00d7 10\u221212 yr\u22121\nG\n2 Pb\n\n(4)\n\nThis limit is of the same order as those previously derived from pulsar timing (see Section\n1), but a currently ongoing VLBI campaign on this pulsar is expected to improve significantly\non our parallax measurement, and this should improve our limit to close to that put by LLR\n((4 \u00b1 9) \u00d7 10\u221213 yr\u22121 ; Williams, Turyshev & Boggs 2004). The LLR experiment is based\non a complex n\u2013body relativistic model of the planets that incorporates over 140 estimated\nparameters, such as elastic deformation, rotational dissipation and two tidal dissipation\nparameters. In contrast, the PSR J0437\u22124715 timing result is dependent on a different set\nof models and assumptions, and therefore provides a useful independent confirmation of the\nLLR result.\nA recent investigation into the possible causes of a measured variability of the Astronomical Unit (AU; Krasinsky & Brumberg 2004) has refuted all but two sources of the measured\nvalue of dAU/dt = 0.15\u00b10.04 m/yr. Krasinsky & Brumberg (2004) state that the measured\nlinear increase in the AU would be due to either systematic effects or to a time-variation of\nG at the level of \u0120/G = (\u221210 \u00b1 3) \u00d7 10\u221213 yr\u22121 , comparable to, but inconsistent with, the\nLLR limit.\nThe anomalous P \u0307b measurements of a number of millisecond pulsars have also been used\nto place limits on the acceleration of the Solar System due to any nearby stars or undetected\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nmassive planets (Zakamska & Tremaine 2005). The PSR J0437\u22124715 data set limits any\nanomalous Solar System acceleration to |a\u2299 /c| \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 10\u221218 s\u22121 in the direction of the\npulsar with 95% certainty. This rules out any Jupiter-mass planets at distances less than\n117 AU along the line of sight, corresponding to orbital periods of up to 1270 years. Similarly,\nthis analysis excludes any Jupiter-mass planets orbiting PSR J0437\u22124715 between \u223c5 and\n117 AU along the line of sight. Zakamska & Tremaine (2005) also compared the sensitivity\nof this limit to that of optical and infra-red searches for trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs)\nand concluded that beyond \u223c 300 AU the acceleration limit becomes more sensitive than the\nalternative searches. At a distance of 300 AU from the Sun, the 95% confidence upper limit\non the mass of a possible TNO (in the direction of the pulsar) is 6.8 Jupiter masses. The\nprecise VLBI measurement of parallax mentioned above might decrease this to close to one\nJupiter mass.\n\n5.\n\nPulsar Mass\n\nA combination of the mass function and a measurement of the Shapiro delay range can\nbe used to obtain a measurement of the pulsar mass. Using this method, van Straten et al.\n(2001) derived a mass for PSR J0437\u22124715 of 1.58 \u00b1 0.18 M\u2299 whereas Hotan, Bailes & Ord\n(2006) obtained 1.3 \u00b1 0.2 M\u2299 . It should be noted, however, that these values resulted from a\nmodel that incorporated geometric parameters first described by Kopeikin (1995, 1996), but\ncovariances between these and other timing parameters (most importantly the companion\nmass or Shapiro delay range) were not taken into account. Whilst the length of the data\nsets used by these authors were only a few years, it can also be expected that some spectral\nleakage from low-frequency noise was unaccounted in the errors of these previously published\nvalues. As described in Section 2, the Monte-Carlo simulations and extended fitting routines implemented for the results reported in this paper do include these covariances and\nspectral leakage; it can therefore be claimed that the current estimates (at 68% confidence)\nof mc = 0.254 \u00b1 0.018 M\u2299 and mpsr = 1.76 \u00b1 0.20 M\u2299 , for the white dwarf companion and\npulsar respectively, reflect the measurement uncertainty more realistically than any previous\nestimate. The distribution of mpsr that follows from the 5000 Monte-Carlo realizations is\nshown in Figure 2, together with a Gaussian with mean 1.76 and standard deviation 0.20.\nThis demonstrates the symmetric distribution of the pulsar mass likelihood distribution,\ninduced by the precise determination of the orbital inclination angle.\nWe also note that the new mass measurement of PSR J0437\u22124715 is the highest obtained for any pulsar to date. Distinction needs to be made between the objective mass estimate presented in this paper and the subjective mass predictions presented in Ransom et al.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n(2005) and Freire et al. (2007). The pulsar mass confidence interval presented in this paper\nis derived from the measurement uncertainties of all relevant model parameters, including\nthe well-determined orbital inclination angle, i. In contrast, i is unknown in the Terzan\n5 I and J (Ransom et al. 2005) and PSR J1748\u22122021B (Freire et al. 2007) binary systems, and the posterior probability intervals for the pulsar masses presented in these works\nare based upon the prior assumption of a uniform distribution of cos i. These fundamental differences must be accounted for in any subsequent hypothesis testing. Consequently,\nPSR J0437\u22124715 is currently the only pulsar to provide reliable constraints on equations of\nstate based on hyperons and Bose-Einstein condensates as described by Lattimer & Prakash\n(2007). Simulations with Tempo2 indicate that a forthcoming observational campaign with\na new generation of backend systems can be expected to increase the significance of this\nmeasurement by another factor of about two in the next year.\n\n6.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have presented results from the highest-precision long-term timing campaign to date.\nWith an overall residual rms of 199 ns, the 10 years of timing data on PSR J0437\u22124715 have\nprovided a precise measurement of the orbital period derivative, P \u0307b , leading to the first\naccurate kinematic distance to a millisecond pulsar: Dk = 157.0 \u00b1 2.4 pc. Application of\nthis method to other pulsars in the future can be expected to improve distance estimates to\nother binary pulsar systems (Bell & Bailes 1996).\nAnother analysis based on the P \u0307b measurement places a limit on the temporal variation\nof Newton's gravitational constant. We find a bound comparable to the best so far derived\nfrom pulsar timing: \u0120/G = (\u22125 \u00b1 18) \u00d7 10\u221212 yr\u22121 . An ongoing VLBI campaign on this\npulsar is expected to improve this limit, enabling an independent confirmation of the LLR\nlimit.\nPrevious estimates of the mass of PSR J0437\u22124715 have been revised upwards to\nmpsr = 1.76 \u00b1 0.20 M\u2299 , which now makes it one of the few pulsars with such a heavy mass\nmeasurement. A new generation of backend instruments, dedicated observing campaigns,\nand data prewhitening techniques currently under development should decrease the error in\nthis measurement enough to significantly rule out various equations of state for dense nuclear\nmatter.\nThe Parkes Observatory is part of the Australia Telescope which is funded by the Commonwealth of Australia for operation as a National Facility managed by CSIRO.
