The presence of a strong H\u03b4 line\nwithin the spectrum of a galaxy indicates that the galaxy has under\u2013gone a\nsignificant change in its star formation history within the last Gigayear. Therefore, such galaxies have received considerable attention in recent years, as they\nprovide an opportunity to study galaxy evolution in action. These galaxies are\ncommonly known as \"post\u2013starburst\", \"E+A\", \"k+a\" and H\u03b4\u2013strong galaxies,\nand the study of these galaxies has been severely hampered by the lack of a large,\nstatistical sample of such galaxies. In this paper, we rectify this problem by selecting a sample of galaxies which possess an absorption H\u03b4 equivalent width of\nEW(H\u03b4max ) \u2212 \u2206EW(H\u03b4max ) > 4\u00c5from 106682 galaxies in the SDSS. We have\nperformed extensive tests on our catalog including comparing different methodologies of measuring the H\u03b4 absorption lines and studying the effects of stellar\nabsorption, dust extinction and emission\u2013filling on our measurements. We have\ndetermined the external error on our H\u03b4 measurements using duplicate observations of 11538 galaxies in the SDSS. The measured abundance of our H\u03b4\u2013selected\n(HDS) galaxies is 2.6 \u00b1 0.1% of all galaxies within a volume\u2013limited sample of\n0.05 < z < 0.1 and M(r \u2217 ) < \u221220.5, which is consistent with previous studies of\nsuch galaxies in the literature. We find that only 25 of our HDS galaxies in this\nvolume\u2013limited sample (3.5 \u00b1 0.7%) show no, or little, evidence for [Oii] and H\u03b1\nemission lines, thus indicating that true E+A (or k+a) galaxies (as originally\ndefined by Dressler & Gunn) are extremely rare objects at low redshift, i.e., only\n0.09 \u00b1 0.02% of all galaxies in this volume\u2013limited sample are true E+A galaxies.\nIn contrast, 89 \u00b1 5% of our HDS galaxies in the volume\u2013limited sample have\nsignificant detections of the [Oii] and H\u03b1 emission lines. Of these, only 131\ngalaxies are robustly classified as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and therefore,\na majority of these emission line HDS galaxies are star\u2013forming galaxies. We\nfind that 52 \u00b1 12% (27/52) of galaxies in our volume\u2013limited HDS sample that\npossess no detectable [Oii] emission, do however possess detectable H\u03b1 emission\nlines. These galaxies may be dusty star\u2013forming galaxies. We provide the community with this new catalog of H\u03b4\u2013selected galaxies to aid in the understanding\nof these galaxies, via detailed follow\u2013up observations, as well as providing a low\nredshift sample for comparison with higher redshift studies of HDS galaxies. We\nwill study the global properties of these galaxies in future papers.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe presence of a strong H\u03b4 absorption line (equivalent width of >\n\u223c 5\u00c5) in the spectrum\nof a galaxy is an indication that the spectral energy distribution of that galaxy is dominated\nby A stars. Models of galaxy evolution indicate that such a strong H\u03b4 line (in the spectrum of\na galaxy) can only be reproduced using models that include a recent burst of star formation,\nfollowed by passive evolution, as any on\u2013going star\u2013formation in the galaxy would hide the\nH\u03b4 absorption line due to emission\u2013filling (of the H\u03b4 line) and the dominance of hot O and B\nstars, which have intrinsically weaker H\u03b4 absorption than A stars (see, for example, Balogh et\nal. 1999; Poggianti et al. 1999). Therefore the existence of a strong H\u03b4 absorption line in the\nspectrum of a galaxy suggests that the galaxy has under\u2013gone a recent transformation in its\nstar\u2013formation history. In the literature, such galaxies are called \"post\u2013starburst\", \"E+A\",\nk+a, and H\u03b4\u2013strong galaxies and the exact physical mechanism(s) responsible for the abrupt\nchange in the star formation history of such galaxies remains unclear. These galaxies have\nreceived much attention as they provide an opportunity to study galaxy evolution \"in action\".\nH\u03b4\u2013strong galaxies were first discovered by Dressler & Gunn (1983, 1992) in their spectroscopic study of galaxies in distant, rich clusters of galaxies. They discovered cluster\ngalaxies that contained strong Balmer absorption lines but with no detectable [Oii] emission lines. They named such galaxies \"E+A\", as their spectra resembled the superposition of\nan elliptical galaxy spectrum and A star spectrum. Therefore, E+A (or k+a) galaxies were\noriginally thought to be a cluster\u2013specific phenomenon and several physical mechanisms have\nbeen proposed to explain such galaxies. For example, ram\u2013pressure stripping of the intra\u2013\nstellar gas by a hot, intra\u2013cluster medium, which eventually leads to the termination of star\nformation once all the gas in the galaxy has been removed, or used up (Gunn & Gott 1972;\nFarouki & Shapiro 1980; Kent 1981; Abadi, Moore & Bower 1999; Fujita & Nagashima 1999;\nQuilis, Moore & Bower 2000). Alternative mechanisms include high\u2013speed galaxy\u2013galaxy\ninteractions in clusters (Moore et al. 1996, 1999) and interactions with the gravitational\npotential well of the cluster (Byrd & Valtonen 1990; Valluri 1993; Bekki, Shioya & Couch\n2001).\nTo test such hypotheses, Zabludoff et al. (1996) performed a search for E+A (or k+a)\ngalaxies in the Las Campanas Redshift Survey (LCRS; Shectman et al. 1996) and found that\nonly 21 of the 11113 LCRS galaxies they studied, satisfied their criteria for a E+A galaxy.\nThis work clearly demonstrates the rarity of such galaxies at low redshift. Furthermore,\nZabludoff et al. (1996) found that 75% of their selected galaxies reside in the field, rather than\nthe cores of rich clusters. This conclusion was confirmed by Balogh et al. (1999), who also\nperformed a search for H\u03b4\u2013strong galaxies in the redshift surveys of the Canadian Network\nfor Observational Cosmology (CNOC; Yee, Ellingson, & Carlberg 1996), and found that the\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nfraction of such galaxies in clusters was consistent with that in the field. Alternatively, the\nstudy of Dressler et al. (1999) found an order\u2013of\u2013magnitude increase in the abundance of\nE+A (or k+a) galaxies in distant clusters compared to the field (see also Castander et al.\n2001). Taken together, these studies suggest that the physical interpretation of H\u03b4\u2013strong\ngalaxies is more complicated than originally envisaged, with the possibility that different\nphysical mechanisms are important in different environment, e.g., 5 of the 21 E+A galaxies\ndiscovered by Zabludoff et al. (1996) show signs of tidal features, indicative of galaxy\u2013galaxy\ninteractions or mergers. Furthermore, redshift evolution might be an important factor in the\ndifferences seen between these surveys.\nIn addition to studying the environment of H\u03b4\u2013strong galaxies, several authors have\nfocused on understanding the morphology and dust content of these galaxies. This has been\ndriven by the fact that on\u2013going star formation in post\u2013starburst galaxies could be hidden\nby dust obscuration (See Poggianti & Barbaro 1997; Poggianti et al. 1999; Bekki et al. 2001\nfor more discussion). In fact, Smail et al (1999) discovered examples of such galaxies using\ninfrared (IR) and radio observations of galaxies in distant clusters. They discovered five\npost\u2013starburst galaxies (based on their optical spectra) that showed evidence for dust\u2013lanes\nin their IR morphology, as well as radio emission consistent with on\u2013going star formation.\nHowever, radio observations of the Zabludoff et al. (1996) sample of nearby E+A galaxies\nindicates that a majority of these galaxies are not dust\u2013enshrouded starburst galaxies. For\nexample, Miller & Owen (2001) only detected radio emission from 2 of the 15 E+A galaxies\nthey observed, and the derived star\u2013formation rates (SFRs) were consistent with quiescent\nstar formation and thus much lower than those observed for the dust\u2013enshrouded starburst\ngalaxies of Smail et al (1999). Chang et al. (2001) also did not detect radio emission from\n5 E+A galaxies they observed from the Zabludoff et al. (1996) sample and concluded that\nthese galaxies were not dust\u2013enshrouded starbursts. In summary, these studies demonstrate\nthat some E+A galaxies have dust\u2013enshrouded star formation, but the fraction remains ill\u2013\ndetermined. Furthermore, it is unclear how these different sub\u2013classes of galaxies are related,\nand if there are any environmental and evolutionary processes at play.\nThe interpretation of H\u03b4\u2013strong galaxies (E+A, k+a, etc.) suffers from small number\nstatistics and systematic differences in the selection and definition of such galaxies between\nthe different surveys constructed to date. Therefore, many of the difficulties associated with\nunderstanding the physical nature of these galaxies could be solved through the study of a\nlarge, homogeneous sample of H\u03b4 galaxies. In this paper, we present such a sample derived\nfrom the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000). The advantage of this sample,\nover previous work, is the quality and quantity of both the photometric and spectroscopic\ndata, as well as the homogeneous selection of SDSS galaxies which covers a wide range of\nlocal environments.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nWe present in this paper a sample of galaxies that have been selected based solely on\nthe observed strength of their H\u03b4 absorption line. Our selection is thus inclusive, containing\nmany of the sub\u2013classes of galaxies discussed in the literature until now, e.g., \"E+A\" or\n\"k+a\" galaxies (Zabludoff et al. 1996; Dressler et al. 1999), post\u2013starburst galaxies, dust\u2013\nenshrouded starburst galaxies (Smail et al. 1999), H\u03b4\u2013strong galaxies (Couch & Sharples\n1987) and the different subsamples of galaxies (i.e., e(a), A+em) discussed by Poggianti et\nal. (1999) and Balogh et al. (1999). Therefore, to avoid confusion with other samples in the\nliterature, we simply call this sample of SDSS galaxies; \"H\u03b4\u2013selected\" (HDS) galaxies.\nIn this paper, we present the details of our selection and leave the investigation and\ninterpretation of these HDS galaxies to subsequent papers. We publish our sample of HDS\ngalaxies to help the community construct larger samples of such galaxies, which are critically\nneeded to advance our understanding of these galaxies, as well as aiding in the planning of\nfollow\u2013up observations and comparisons with higher redshift studies of such galaxies.\nIn Section 2, we present a brief discussion of the SDSS and the data used in this paper.\nIn Section 3, we discuss our techniques for measuring the H\u03b4 absorption line and present\ncomparisons between the different methodologies used to measure this line. In Section 4, we\ndiscuss the criteria used to select of our HDS sample of galaxies and present data on 3340\nsuch galaxies in our catalog. In Section 5, we compare our sample of galaxies with those\nin the literature. A more detailed analysis of the properties of our HDS galaxies will be\ndiscussed in subsequent papers. The cosmological parameters used throughout this paper\nare H0 =75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9m = 0.3 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.7.\n\n2.\n\nThe SDSS Data\n\nIn this Section, we briefly describe the spectroscopic part of the SDSS. As discussed\nin York et al. (2000), the SDSS plans to obtain spectra for \u2243 106 galaxies to a magnitude\nlimit of r \u2217 = 17.7 (the \"Main\" galaxy sample; Strauss et al. 2002), \u2243 105 Luminous Red\nGalaxies (LRG; Eisenstein et al. 2001) and \u2243 105 quasars (Richards et al. 2002). The reader\nis referred to Fukugita et al. (1996), Gunn et al. (1998), Lupton et al. (1999, 2001), York\net al. (2000), Hogg et al. (2001), Pier et al. (2002), Stoughton et al. (2002), Smith et al.\n(2002) and Blanton et al. (2002a) for more details of the SDSS data and survey.\nThe SDSS spectra are obtained using two fiber-fed spectrographs (each with 320 fibers),\nwith each fiber sub-tending 3 arcseconds on the sky. The wavelength coverage of the spectrographs is 3800\u00c5 to 9200\u00c5, with a spectral resolution of 1800. The data from these\nspectrographs is automatically reduced to produce flux and wavelength\u2013calibrated spectra\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n(SPECTRO2D data analysis pipeline).\nThe SDSS spectra are then analyzed via the SDSS SPECTRO1D data processing\npipeline to obtain a host of measured quantities for each spectrum (see Stoughton et al.\n2002; Frieman et al., in prep, for further details). For example, SPECTRO1D determines\nthe redshift of the spectrum both from absorption lines (via cross-correlation; Heavens 1993),\nand emission lines (via a wavelet\u2013based peak\u2013finding algorithm; see Frieman et al., in prep).\nOnce the redshift is known, SPECTRO1D estimates the continuum emission at each pixel\nusing the median value seen in a sliding box of 100 pixels centered on that pixel. Emission\nand absorption lines are then measured automatically by fitting of a Gaussian, above the\nbest\u2013fit continuum, at the redshifted rest\u2013wavelength of expected lines. Multiple Gaussians\nare fit simultaneously for potential blends of lines (i.e., H\u03b1 and [Nii] lines). SPECTRO1D\ntherefore provides an estimate of the equivalent width (EW), continuum, rest wavelength,\nidentification, goodness\u2013of\u2013fit (\u03c72 ), height and sigma (and the associated statistical errors\non these quantities) for all the major emission/absorption lines in these spectra. These measurements are done regardless of whether the line has been detected or not. For this work,\nwe have used data from rerun 15 of the SPECTRO1D analysis pipeline, which is based on\nversion 4.9 of the SPECTRO2D analysis pipeline (see Frieman et al. in prep for details of\nthese pipelines).\nFor the sample of HDS galaxies presented in this paper, we begin with a sample of the\nSDSS galaxies that satisfy the following selection criteria:\n1. Spectroscopically\u2013confirmed by SPECTRO1D to be a galaxy;\n2. Possess a redshift confidence of \u2265 0.7;\n3. An average spectroscopic signal\u2013to\u2013noise of > 5 per pixel in the SDSS photometric g\npassband;\n4. z\u22650.05, to minimize aperture effects as discussed in Zaritsky, Zabuldoff & Willick\n(1995) and Gomez et al. (2003).\nThe reader is referred to Stoughton et al. (2002) for further details on all these SDSS\nquantities and how they are determined. After removing duplicate observations of the same\ngalaxy (11538 galaxies in total; see Section 3.4), 106682 galaxies satisfy these criteria, up\nto and including spectroscopic plate 804 (observed on a Modified Julian Date of 52266 or\n12/23/01; see Stoughton et al. 2002). Of these 106682 galaxies, it was only possible to\nmeasure the H\u03b4 line for 95479 galaxies (see Section 3.1 below) due to masked pixels at or\nnear the H\u03b4 line. In Figure 1, we present the distribution of signal\u2013to\u2013noise ratios for all\n106682 spectra (the median value of this distribution is 8.3).\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nThroughout this analysis, we have used the \"smeared\" SDSS spectra, which improves\nthe overall spectrophotometric calibration of these data by accounting for light missed from\nthe 3\" fibers due to seeing and atmospheric refraction (see Gomez et al. 2003; Stoughton et\nal. 2002 for observational detail). Unfortunately, this smearing correction can systematically\nbias the observed flux of any emission and absorption lines in the spectrum, as the correction\nis only applied to the continuum. As shown by Hopkins et al. in prep., this is only a \u2243 10%\neffect on the flux of spectral lines, compared to using spectral data without the smearing\ncorrection applied. Furthermore, the equivalent width of our lines is almost unaffected by\nthis smearing correction as, by definition, they are computed relative to the height of the\ncontinuum.\n\n3.\n\nSpectral Line Measurements\n3.1.\n\nH\u03b4 Equivalent Width\n\nIn this Section, we discuss the measurement of the equivalent width (EW) of the H\u03b4\nabsorption line in the SDSS galaxy spectra described in Section 2. The presence of a strong\nH\u03b4 absorption line in a galaxy spectrum indicates that the stellar population of the galaxy\ncontains a significant fraction of A stars, which must have formed within the last Gigayear\n(see Section 1). The H\u03b4 line is preferred over other Hydrogen Balmer lines (e.g., H\u01eb, H\u03b6,\nH\u03b3, H\u03b2) because the line is isolated from other emission and absorption lines, as well as\nstrong continuum features in the galaxy spectrum (e.g., D4000). Furthermore, the higher\norder Balmer lines (H\u03b3 and H\u03b2) can suffer from significant emission\u2013filling (see Section 3.3),\nwhile the lower order lines (H\u01eb and H\u03b6) are low signal\u2013to\u2013noise in the SDSS spectra.\nIn previous studies, several different methods have been employed to measure the H\u03b4\nline, or select post\u2013starburst galaxies. For example, Zabludoff et al. (1996) used the average EW of the H\u03b2 , H\u03b3 and H\u03b4 lines to select E+A galaxies. Alternatively, Dressler et\nal. (1999) and Poggianti et al. (1999) interactively fit Gaussian profiles to the H\u03b4 line.\nFinally, Abraham et al. (1996), Balogh et al. (1999) and Miller & Owen (2002) performed\na non\u2013parametric analysis of their galaxy spectra, which involved summing the flux in a\nnarrow wavelength window centered on each of the H\u03b4 line to determine the EW of the line.\nCastander et al. (2001) used an innovative PCA and wavelet analysis of spectra to select\nE+A galaxies. Each of these methods have different advantages and dis\u2013advantages. For\nexample, fitting a Gaussian to the H\u03b4 line is optimal for high signal\u2013to\u2013noise spectra, but\ncan be prone to erroneous results when fit blindly to low signal\u2013to\u2013noise data or a weak\nabsorption lines (such problems can be avoided if Gaussians are fit interactively; see Dressler\net al. 1999; Poggianti et al. 1999). In light of the potential systematic differences between\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nthe different methods of measuring the H\u03b4 line, we have investigated the relative merits of\nthe two main approaches in the literature \u2013 fitting a Gaussian and summing the flux in a\nnarrow wavelength window \u2013 for determining the EW of the H\u03b4 line for the signal\u2013to\u2013noise,\nresolution, and size of the SDSS spectral dataset used in this paper.\nFirst, we investigate the optimal method for computing the EW of the H\u03b4 line from\nthe SDSS spectra using the non\u2013parametric methodology outlined in Abraham et al. (1996)\nand Balogh et al. (1999), i.e., summing the flux within narrow wavelength windows centered\non and off the H\u03b4 absorption line. We estimate the continuum flux via linear interpolation\nbetween two wavelength windows placed either side of the H\u03b4 line (4030\u00c5 to 4082\u00c5 and\n4122\u00c5 to 4170\u00c5). We used the same wavelength windows as in Abraham et al. (1996)\nand Balogh et al. (1999) for estimating the continuum because they are devoid of any\nstrong emission and absorption features, and the continuum is relatively smooth within these\nwavelength ranges. Also, these windows are close to the H\u03b4 line without being contaminated\nby the H\u03b4 line emission. When fitting the continuum flux level, the flux in each pixel was\nweighted by the inverse square of the error on the flux in that pixel. After the initial fit to\nthe continuum, we re\u2013iterate the fit once by rejecting 3\u03c3 outliers to the original continuum\nfit. This guards against noise spikes in the surrounding continuum.\nThe rest\u2013frame EW of the H\u03b4 line was calculated by summing the ratio of the flux in\neach pixel of the spectrum, over the estimated continuum flux in that pixel based on our\nlinear interpolation. For this summation, we investigated two different wavelength windows\nfor the H\u03b4 line; 4088\u00c5 to 4116\u00c5, which is the same as the wavelength range used by Balogh\net al. (1999)13 and 4082\u00c5 to 4122\u00c5, which is the wider range of Abraham et al. (1996). We\nsummarize the wavelength ranges used to measure the H\u03b4 EWs in Table 1.\nIn Figure 2, we compare the two non\u2013parametric measurements of H\u03b4 (i.e., using the\nnarrow and wide wavelength windows), and find, as expected, a strong linear relationship\nbetween the two measurements: The scatter about the best fit linear relationship to these\nmeasurements is Gaussian with \u03c3 = 0.29\u00c5. However, there are systematic differences between\nthe two measurements which are correlated to the intrinsic width of the H\u03b4 line. For example,\nfor large EWs of H\u03b4, we find that the wider wavelength window has a larger value than the\nnarrower window. This is because the 28\u00c5 window is too small to capture the wings of\na strong H\u03b4 line and thus a wider window is needed. Alternatively, for smaller EWs, the\nnarrower 28\u00c5 window is better as the larger window of 40\u00c5 is more affected by noise as it\ncontains more of the continuum flux than the narrow window. This is seen in Figure 2 where\n13\n\nWe note that Table 1 of Balogh et al. (1999) has a typographical error. The authors used the wavelength\nrange of 4088\u00c5 to 4116\u00c5 to measure their H\u03b4 EWs instead of 4082\u00c5 to 4122\u00c5 as quoted in the paper.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nthe larger window systematically over\u2013estimates the EW of the weaker H\u03b4 lines.\nAs a compromise, we have empirically determined that the best methodology for our\nanalysis is to always select the larger of the two H\u03b4 EW measurements (this was discovered\nby visually inspecting many of the spectra and their various H\u03b4 measurements). This is a\ncrude adaptive approach of selecting the size of the window based on the intrinsic strength\nof the H\u03b4 line. In fact, we find that 20.2% of our H\u03b4\u2013selected galaxies (see Section 4)\nwere selected based on the H\u03b4 measurement in the larger wavelength window. Therefore,\nfor the analysis presented in this paper, we use H\u03b4max , which is the maximum of the two\nnon\u2013parametric measurements discussed above.\nIn Figure 3, we now compare the H\u03b4max measurement discussed above to the automatic\nGaussian fits to the H\u03b4 line from the SDSS SPECTRO1D analysis of the spectra. As\nexpected, the two methods give similar results for the EW of the H\u03b4 line for the largest\nEWs. However, there are significant differences, as seen in Figure 3, between these two\nmethodologies. First, there are many galaxies with a negative EW (emission) as measured\nby SPECTRO1D, but possess a (large) positive EW (absorption) using the non\u2013parametric\nmethod. These cases are caused by emission\u2013filling, i.e., a small amount of H\u03b4 emission at\nthe bottom of the H\u03b4 absorption line (see Section 3.3). This results in SPECTRO1D fitting\nthe Gaussian to the central emission line, thus producing a negative EW. On the other\nhand, the non\u2013parametric method simply sums all the flux in the region averaging over the\nemission and still producing a positive EW. In Figure 4, we present five typical examples of\nthis phenomenon.\nAnother noticeable difference in Figure 3 is the deviation from the one\u2013to\u2013one relation\nfor H\u03b4 EWs near zero, i.e., as the H\u03b4 line becomes weak, it is buried in the noise of the\ncontinuum making it difficult to automatically fit a Gaussian to the line. In such cases,\nSPECTRO1D tends to over\u2013estimate the EW of the H\u03b4 line because it preferentially fits a\nbroad, shallow Gaussian to the noise in the spectrum. Typical examples of this problem are\nshown in Figure 5. We conclude from our study of the SDSS spectra that the non\u2013parametric\ntechniques of Abraham et al. (1996) and Balogh et al. (1999) are preferred to the automatic\nGaussian fits of SPECTRO1D, especially for the lower signal\u2013to\u2013noise SDSS spectra which\nare a majority in our sample (see Figure 1). We note that many of the problems associated\nwith the automatic Gaussian fitting of SPECTRO1D can be avoided by fitting Gaussians\ninteractively. However, this is not practical for large datasets such as the SDSS.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n3.2.\n\n[Oii] and H\u03b1 Equivalent Widths\n\nIn addition to estimating the EW of the H\u03b4 line, we have used our flux\u2013summing\ntechnique to estimate the rest frame equivalent widths of both the [Oii] and H\u03b1 emission\nlines. We perform this analysis on all SDSS spectra, in preference to using the SPECTRO1D\nmeasurements of these lines, as these emission lines are the primary diagnostics of on\u2013going\nstar\u2013formation in a galaxy and thus, we are interested in detecting any evidence of these\nlines in our HDS galaxies. As discussed in Section 3.1, the flux\u2013summing technique is better\nfor the lower signal\u2013to\u2013noise spectra, while the Gaussian\u2013fitting method of SPECTRO1D is\noptimal for higher signal\u2013to\u2013noise detections of these emission lines, especially in the case\nof H\u03b1 where SPECTRO1D de\u2013blends the H\u03b1 and [Nii] lines.\nWe use the same flux\u2013summing methodology as discussed above for the H\u03b4 line, except\nwe only use one wavelength window centered on the two emission lines. We list in Table 1\nthe wavelength intervals used in summing the flux for the [Oii] and H\u03b1 emission lines and\nthe continuum regions around these lines. Once again, the continuum flux per pixel for each\nemission line was estimated using linear interpolation of the continuum estimated either side\nof the emission lines (weighted by the inverse square of the errors on the pixel values during\na line fitting procedure). We again iterate the continuum fit once rejecting 3\u03c3 outliers to the\noriginal continuum fit. We do not de\u2013blend the H\u03b1 and [Nii] lines and as a result, some\nof our H\u03b1 EW measurements may be over\u2013estimated. However the contamination is less\nthan 5% from [Nii] line at 6648\u00c5 and less than 30% from [Nii] line at 6583\u00c5. We present\nestimates of the external error on our measurements of [Oii] and H\u03b1 in Section 3.4.\nIn Figure 7, we compare our [Oii] equivalent width measurements to that from SPECTRO1D for all SDSS spectra. In this paper, positive EWs are absorption lines and negative EWs are emission lines. There is a good agreement between the two methods for\nEW([Oii])> 10\u00c5, where the scatter is <\n\u223c 10%. However, at lower EWs, the SPECTRO1D\nmeasurement of [Oii] is systematically larger than our flux\u2013summing method which is the\nresult of SPECTRO1D fitting a broad Gaussian to the noise in the spectrum. Furthermore,\nour continuum measurements for the [Oii] line are estimated close to the [Oii] line, in a\nregion of the spectrum where the continuum is varying rapidly with wavelength (e.g., D4000\nbreak). Once again, we are only concerned with making a robust detection of any [Oii] emission, rather than trying to accurately quantify the properties of the emission line. Therefore,\nwe prefer our non\u2013parametric method, especially for the low signal\u2013to\u2013noise cases.\nIn Figure 8, we compare our H\u03b1 equivalent width measurements against that of SPECTRO1D for all SDSS spectra regardless of their H\u03b4 EW. The two locii of points seen in\nthis figure are caused by contamination in our estimates of H\u03b1 due to strong emission lines\nin AGNs, i.e., the top locus of points have larger EWs in our flux\u2013summing method than\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nmeasured by SPECTRO1D due to contamination by the [Nii] lines. This is confirmed by\nthe fact that the top locus of points is dominated by AGNs. At low H\u03b1 EWs, we again see\na systematic difference between our measurements and those of SPECTRO1D, with SPECTRO1D again over\u2013estimating the H\u03b1 line because it is jointly fitting multiple Gaussians to\nlow signal\u2013to\u2013noise detections of the H\u03b1 and [Nii] emission lines. Finally, we do not make\nany correction for extinction and stellar absorption on our flux\u2013summed measurements of\nH\u03b1(see Section 3.3).\n\n3.3.\n\nEmission\u2013Filling of the H\u03b4 Line\n\nAs mentioned above, our measurements of the H\u03b4 absorption line can be affected by\nemission\u2013filling, i.e., H\u03b4 emission at the bottom of the H\u03b4 absorption line. This problem\ncould be solved by fitting two Gaussians to the H\u03b4 line; one for absorption, one for emission.\nWe found however that this method is only reliable for spectra with a signal\u2013to\u2013noise of > 20\nand, as shown in Figure 1, this is only viable for a small fraction of our spectra. Therefore,\nwe must explore an alternative approach for correcting for this potential systematic bias;\nhowever, we stress that the sense of any systematic bias on our non\u2013parametric summing\nmethod would be to always decrease (less absorption) the observed EW of the H\u03b4 absorption\nline and thus our technique gives a lower limit to the amount of H\u03b4 absorption in the\nspectrum.\nTo help rectify the problem of emission\u2013filling, we have used the H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 emission\nlines (where available) to jointly constrain the amount of emission\u2013filling at the H\u03b4 line\nas well as estimate the effects of internal dust extinction in the galaxy. Furthermore, our\nestimates of the emission\u2013filling are complicated by the effects of stellar absorption on the\nH\u03b1 and H\u03b2 emission lines. In this analysis, we have used the SPECTRO1D measurements\nof H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 lines in preference to our flux\u2013summing technique discussed in Section 3.2,\nbecause the emission\u2013filling correction is only important in strongly star\u2013forming galaxies\nwhere the H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 emission lines are well fit by a Gaussian and, for the H\u03b1 line, require\ncareful de\u2013blending from the [Nii] lines.\nTo solve the problem of emission\u2013filling, we have adopted two different methodologies\nwhich we describe in detail below. The first method is an iterative procedure that begins\nwith a initial estimate for the amount of stellar absorption at the H\u03b2 and H\u03b1 emission lines,\ni.e., we assume EW (absorption) = 1.5\u00c5 and H\u03b1 EW (absorption) = 1.9\u00c5 (see Poggianti\n& Barbaro 1997; Miller & Owen 2002). Then, using the observed ratio of the H\u03b1 and H\u03b2\nemission lines (corrected for stellar absorption), in conjunction with an attenuation law of\n\u03c4 = A \u03bb\u22120.7 (Charlot & Fall 2000) for galactic extinction and a theoretical H\u03b1 to H\u03b2 ratio\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nof 2.87 (case B recombination; Osterbrock 1989), we solve for A in the attenuation law and\nthus gain extinction\u2013corrected values for both the H\u03b2 and H\u03b1 emission lines. Next, using\nthe theoretical ratio of H\u03b2 emission to H\u03b4 emission, we obtain an estimate for the amount\nof emission\u2013filling (extinction\u2013corrected) in the H\u03b4 absorption line. We then correct the\nobserved H\u03b4 absorption EW for this emission\u2013filling and, assuming the EW(H\u03b4) absorption\nis equal to EW(H\u03b2) absorption and EW(H\u03b1) absorption is equal to 1.3 + 0.4\u00d7 EW(H\u03b2)\nabsorption (Keel 1983), we obtain new estimates for the stellar absorption at the H\u03b1 and\nH\u03b2 emission lines, i.e., where we begun the iteration. We iterate this calculation five times,\nbut on average, a stable solution converges after only one iteration.\nOur second method uses the D4000 break to estimate the amount of stellar absorption\nat H\u03b2, using EW(H\u03b2) = \u22125.5 \u00d7 D4000 + 11.6 (Poggianti & Barbaro 1997; Miller & Owen\n2002). Then, assuming EW(H\u03b1) absorption is equal to 1.3 + 0.4\u00d7 EW(H\u03b2) absorption,\nwe obtain an measurement for the amount of stellar absorption at both the H\u03b1 and H\u03b2\nabsorption lines. As in the first method above, we use the Charlot & Fall (2000) attenuation\nlaw, and the theoretical H\u03b1 to H\u03b2 ratio, to solve for the amount of extinction at H\u03b1 and H\u03b2,\nand then use these extinction\u2013corrected emission lines to estimate the amount of emission\u2013\nfilling at H\u03b4. We do not iterate this method, as we have used the measured D4000 break to\nindependently estimate the amount of stellar absorption at H\u03b2 and H\u03b1.\nWe have applied these two methods to all our SDSS spectra, except for any galaxy that\npossesses a robust detection of an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) based on the line indices\ndiscussed in Kewley et al. (2002) and Gomez et al. (2003). For these AGN classifications, we\nhave used the SPECTRO1D emission line measurements. We also stop our emission\u2013filling\ncorrection if the ratio of the H\u03b2 and H\u03b1 line becomes unphysical, i.e., greater than 2.87. By\ndefinition, the emission\u2013filling correction increases our observed values of the H\u03b4 absorption\nline, with a median correction of 15% in the flux of the H\u03b4 absorption line. In Figure 6,\nwe show the distributions of H\u03b4 emission EWs calculated using the two methods described\nabove in a solid (iteration) and a dashed (D4000) line, respectively. It is re\u2013assuring that\noverall these two methods give the same answer and have similar distributions.\n\n3.4.\n\nExternal Errors on our Measured Equivalent Widths\n\nBefore we select our HDS sample of galaxies, it is important to accurately quantify the\nerrors on our EW measurements. In our data, there are 11538 galaxies spectroscopically\nobserved twice (see Section 2), which we use to quantify the external error on our EW\nmeasurements. In Figures 9, 10 & 11, we present the absolute difference in equivalent width\nof the two independent observations of the H\u03b4 , H\u03b1 and [Oii] lines, as a function of signal\u2013\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nto\u2013noise. In this analysis, we have used the lower of the two measured signal\u2013to\u2013noise ratios\n(in SDSS g band for H\u03b4 and H\u03b2, or r band for H\u03b1) as any observed difference in the two\nmeasurements of the EW will be dominated by the error in the noisier (lower signal\u2013to\u2013noise)\nof the two spectra. From this data, we determine the 1\u03c3 error for each line and assign this,\nas a function of signal\u2013to\u2013noise, to our EW measurements for each galaxy. We determine the\nsigma of the distribution by fitting a Gaussian (as a function of signal\u2013to\u2013noise) as shown\nin Figures 12, 13 & 14, and then use a 3rd order polynomial to interpolate between the\nsignal\u2013to\u2013noise bins, thus obtaining the solid lines shown in Figures 9, 10 & 11. Using these\npolynomial fits, we can estimate the 1\u03c3 error on our EWs for any signal\u2013to\u2013noise. The\ncoefficients of the fitted 3rd order polynomial for each line are given in Table 2.\nIn addition to quantifying the error on [Oii], H\u03b1 and H\u03b4, we have used the duplicate\nobservations of SDSS galaxies to determine the error on our emission\u2013filling corrections.\nOnly 400 (564) of the 11538 duplicate observations of SDSS galaxies have strong H\u03b1 and\nH\u03b2 emission lines which are required for the iterative (D4000) method of correcting for\nemission\u2013filling. The errors on the emission\u2013filling correction are only a weak function of\nsignal\u2013to\u2013noise, so we have chosen to use a constant value for their error, rather than varying\nthe error as a function of the galaxy signal\u2013to\u2013noise as done for H\u03b4, [Oii] and H\u03b1 emission\nlines. One sigma errors on the emission correction of H\u03b4 for the iterative method (EF1) and\nthe D4000 method (EF2) are 0.57\u00c5 and 0.4\u00c5 in EW, respectively.\n\n4.\n\nA Catalog of HDS Galaxies\n\nWe are now ready to select our sample of HDS galaxies using the non-parametric measurements of the H\u03b4 EW (i.e., EW(H\u03b4max )). We begin by imposing the following threshold\non EW(H\u03b4max );\nEW(H\u03b4max ) \u2212 \u2206EW(H\u03b4max ) > 4\u00c5,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u2206EW(H\u03b4max ) is the 1\u03c3 error on H\u03b4 based on the signal\u2013to\u2013noise of the spectrum (see\nFigure 9). We have chosen this threshold (4\u00c5) based on visual inspections of the data and\nour desire to select galaxies similar to those selected by other authors (Zabludoff et al. 1996;\nBalogh et al. 1999; Poggianti et al. 1999), i.e., galaxies with strong recent star formation\nas defined by the H\u03b4 line. This threshold (Eqn. 1) is applied without any emission\u2013filling\ncorrection. For the signal\u2013to\u2013noise ratios of our spectra (Figure 1), only galaxies with an\nobserved H\u03b4 of >\n\u223c 5\u00c5 satisfy Eqn. 1, which is close to the 5\u00c5 threshold used by Balogh et al.\n(1999) to separate normal star\u2013formating galaxies from post\u2013starburst galaxies (see Figures\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n8 & 9 in their paper). Therefore, our HDS sample should be similar to those already in the\nliterature, but is still conservative enough to be inclusive of the many different subsamples\nof H\u03b4\u2013strong galaxies, like k+a, a+k, A+em and e(a), as discussed in Pogginati et al. (1999)\nand Balogh et al. (1999). We will present a detailed comparison of our HDS sample with\nmodels of galaxy evolution in future papers.\nWe call the sample of galaxies that satisfy Eqn. 1 \"Sample 1\", and the sample contains\n2526 galaxies from the main SDSS galaxy sample and 234 galaxies targeted for spectroscopy\nfor other reasons, e.g., mostly because they were LRG galaxies (see Eisenstein et al. 2002),\nor some were targeted as stars or quasars (see Gordon et al. 2002).\nWe now apply the emission\u2013filling correction for each galaxy to EW(H\u03b4max ) and select\nan additional sample of galaxies, that were not already selected in Sample 1 via Eqn 1, but\nnow satisfy both the following criteria;\nEW(H\u03b4max ) \u2212 \u2206EW(H\u03b4max ) \u2212 \u2206EW(EF1) > 4\u00c5,\n\n(2)\n\nEW(H\u03b4max ) \u2212 \u2206EW(H\u03b4max ) \u2212 \u2206EW(EF2) > 4\u00c5,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u2206EW(EF1) = 0.57\u00c5 and \u2206EW(EF2) = 0.4\u00c5 are the 1\u03c3 errors on the iterative method\n(EF1) and D4000 method (EF2) of correcting for emission\u2013filling discussed in Section 3.4.\nTherefore, this additional sample of galaxies represents systems that would only satisfy the\nthreshold in Eqn 1 because of the emission\u2013filling correction (in addition to galaxies already\nselected as part of Sample 1). We call this sample of galaxies \"Sample 2\" and it contains\n483 galaxies from the main SDSS galaxy sample and 97 galaxies which were again targeted\nfor spectroscopy for other reasons, e.g., LRG galaxies, stars or quasars. On average, Sample\n2 galaxies have strong emission lines because, by definition, they have the largest emission\u2013\nfilling correction at the H\u03b4 line. We have imposed both of these criteria to control the\nnumber of extra galaxies scattered into the sample. If we relaxed these criteria (i.e., remove\nboth \u2206EW(EF1) and \u2206EW(EF2)), then the sample would increase from 483 galaxies (in\nthe main galaxy sample) to 1029. For completeness, we provide the extra 546 galaxies, which\nwould be included if these criteria were relaxed, on our webpage.\nIn total, 3340 SDSS galaxies satisfy these criteria (Sample 1 plus Sample 2), and we\npresent these galaxies as our catalog of HDS galaxies. We note that only 131 of these\ngalaxies are securely identified as AGNs using the prescription of Kewley et al. (2002) and\nGomez et al. (2003). In Figure 15, we present the fraction of HDS galaxies selected as a\nfunction of their signal\u2013to\u2013noise in SDSS g band. It is re\u2013assuring that there is no observed\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\ncorrelation, which indicates that our selection technique is not biased by the signal\u2013to\u2013noise\nof the original spectra.\nFor each galaxy in Samples 1 and 2, we present the unique SDSS Name (col. 1),\nheliocentric redshift (col. 2), spectroscopic signal\u2013to\u2013noise in the SDSS photometric g band\n(col. 3), Right Ascension (J2000; col. 4) and Declination (J2000; col. 5) in degrees, Right\nAscension (J2000; col. 6) and Declination (J2000; col. 7) in hours, minutes and seconds,\nthe rest\u2013frame EW(H\u03b4) (\u00c5, col. 8), the rest\u2013frame \u2206EW(H\u03b4) (\u00c5, col. 9), the rest\u2013frame\nEW([Oii]) (\u00c5, col. 10), the rest\u2013frame \u2206EW([Oii]) (\u00c5, col. 11), the rest\u2013frame EW(H\u03b1)\n(\u00c5, col. 12), the rest\u2013frame \u2206EW(H\u03b1) (\u00c5, col. 13), the SDSS Petrosian g band magnitude\n(col. 14), the SDSS Petrosian r band magnitude (col. 15), the SDSS Petrosian i band\nmagnitude (col. 16), the SDSS Petrosian z band magnitude (col. 17; all magnitudes are\nextinction corrected), the k\u2013corrected absolute magnitude in the SDSS r band (col. 18),\nSDSS measured seeing in r band (col. 19), concentration index (col. 20, see Shimasaku\net al. 2001 and Strateva et al. 2001 for definition). In Column 21, we present the AGN\nclassification based on the line indices of Kewley et al. (2002), and in Column 22, we present\nour E+A classification flag, which is defined in Section 5.1. An electronic version of our\ncatalog can be obtained at http://astrophysics.phys.cmu.edu/\u223ctomo/ea.14\nIn addition to presenting Samples 1 and 2, we also present a volume\u2013limited sample\nselected from these two samples but within the redshift range of 0.05 < z < 0.1 and with\nM(r \u2217 ) < \u221220.5 (which corresponds to r = 17.7 at z = 0.1, see Gomez et al. 2003). We\nuse Schlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis (1998) to correct for galactic extinction and Blanton et al.\n(2002b; v1 11) to calculate the k\u2013corrections. In Table 3, we present the percentage of HDS\ngalaxies that satisfy our criteria. In this table, the number of galaxies in the whole sample\n(shown in the denominator) changes based on the number of galaxies that could have had\ntheir H\u03b4, [Oii] and H\u03b1 lines measured because of masked pixels in the spectra.\nWe note here that we have not corrected our sample for possible aperture effects, except\nrestrict the sample to z \u2265 0.05: A 3 arcsecond fiber corresponds to 2.7h\u22121\n75 kpc at this\nredshift, which is comparable to the half\u2013light radius of most our galaxies (see also Gomez\net al. 2003). We see an increase of 0.33\u00c5 ( <\n\u223c 10%) in the median observed H\u03b4 EW for the\nwhole HDS sample over the redshift range of our volume\u2013limited sample (0.05 < z < 0.1).\nThis is probably caused by more light from the disks of galaxies going down the fiber at\nhigher redshifts. We see no such trend for the subsample of true E+A galaxies (see Section\n5) in our HDS sample.\n14\n\nMirror\nsites\nare\ntokyo.ac.jp/\u223cyohnis/ea\n\navailable\n\nat\n\nhttp://kokki.phys.cmu.edu/\u223ctomo/ea,\n\nhttp://sdss2.icrr.u-\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n5.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this Section, we compare our sample of HDS galaxies against previous samples of such\ngalaxies in the literature. Further analysis of the global properties (luminosity, environment,\nmorphology, etc.) of these galaxies will be presented in future papers.\n\n5.1.\n\nComparison with Previous Work\n\nIn this Section, we present a preliminary comparison of our SDSS HDS galaxies with\nother samples of post\u2013starburst galaxies in the literature. We have attempted to replicate\nthe selection criteria of these previous studies as closely as possible, but in some cases, this\nis impossible. Furthermore, we have not attempted to account for systematic differences in\nthe distribution of signal\u2013to\u2013noises, differences in the spectral resolutions, and differences\nin the selection techniques used by different authors, e.g., we are unable to fully replicate\nthe criteria of Zabludoff et al. (1996) as we do not yet possess accurate measurements of\nthe H\u03b3 and H\u03b2 lines. Therefore, these are only crude comparisons and any small differences\nseen between the samples should not be over\u2013interpreted until a more detailed analysis can\nbe carried out. We summarize our comparison in Table 4 and discuss the details of these\ncomparisons below: Table 4 does however, demonstrate once again the rarity of H\u03b4\u2013strong\ngalaxies, especially at low redshift, as well as illustrating the sensitivity of their detection to\nthe selection criteria used.\nWe first compare our sample to that of Zabludoff et al. (1996), which is the most similar\nto our work, especially as the magnitude limits of the LCRS (used by Zabludoff et al. 1996)\nand the SDSS are close, thus minimizing possible bias. Zabludoff et al. (1996) selected\nE+A galaxies from the LCRS using the following criteria; a redshift range of 15, 000 <\ncz < 40, 000 km s\u22121, a signal\u2013to\u2013noise of > 8 per pixel, an EW of [Oii] of > \u22122.5\u00c5, and an\naverage EW for the three Balmer lines (H\u03b4, H\u03b3 and H\u03b2) of > 5.5\u00c5. Using these four criteria,\nZabludoff et al. (1996) selected 21 LCRS galaxies as E+A galaxies, which corresponds to\n0.2% of all LCRS that satisfy the same signal\u2013to\u2013noise and redshift limits. We find 80 SDSS\ngalaxies (from the whole SDSS dataset analyzed here) satisfy the same redshift range and\n[Oii] EW detection limit as used by Zabludoff et al. (1996), as well as having H\u03b4 EW of\n>5.5\u00c5, which should be close to the average of the EW of the three Balmer lines (H\u03b4, H\u03b3\nand H\u03b2) used by Zabludoff et al. (1996). Of these 80 galaxies, 71 are in our HDS sample.\nGiven all the caveats discussed above, it is re\u2013assuring that we have found HDS galaxies at\na similar frequency (see Table 4) as Zabludoff et al. (1996) and it suggests that our criteria\nare consistent.\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nSeveral other authors have used similar criteria to Zabludoff et al. (1996) to search for\npost\u2013starburst galaxies in higher redshift samples of galaxies. For example, Fisher et al.\n(1998) used an average EW of the H\u03b4, H\u03b3 and H\u03b2 lines of > 4\u00c5 and an EW of [Oii] of\n< 5\u00c5. With these criteria, they found 4.7% of their galaxies were E+A galaxies. Similarly,\nHammer et al. (1997) used an average of H\u03b4, H\u03b3 and H\u03b2 of > 5.5\u00c5, an EW of [Oii] of\n<5\u201310 \u00c5 and MB <-20 to select E+A galaxies from the CFRS field galaxy sample. They\nfound that 5% of their galaxies satisfied these criteria.\nWe have also attempted to replicate the selection criteria of Dressler et al. (1999) and\nBalogh et al. (1999) as closely as possible, using all SDSS galaxies in the volume\u2013limited\nsample with measured H\u03b4, [Oii] and H\u03b1, and not simply the HDS subsample. For example,\nthe MORPHS collaboration of Dressler et al. (1999) and Poggianti et al. (1999) selected\nE+A galaxies using a H\u03b4 EW of > 3 \u00c5 and an [Oii] EW of < 5\u00c5 . Using these criteria, they\nfound a significant excess of E+A galaxies in their 10 high redshift clusters (21%), compared\nwith the field region (6%). Alternatively, Balogh et al. (1999) selected E+A galaxies using\nH\u03b4 EW of > 5\u00c5 and an [Oii] EW of < 5\u00c5 . They found instead 1.5 \u00b1 0.8% of cluster\ngalaxies were classified as E+A galaxies compared to 1.2 \u00b1 0.8% for the field (brighter than\nM(r) = \u221218.8 + 5logh after correcting for several systematic effects).\nIn Table 4, we present a qualitative comparison of our HDS sample with these higher\nredshift studies and, within the quoted errors, the frequencies of HDS galaxies we observe\nare consistent with these works. However, we caution the reader not to over\u2013interpret these\nnumbers for several reasons. First, we are comparing a low redshift sample (z < 0.1) of HDS\ngalaxies to high redshift studies (z \u2243 0.5) of such galaxies, and we have not accounted for\npossible evolutionary effects or observational biases. In particular, we are comparing our\nsample against the corrected numbers presented by Balogh et al. (1999), which attempt\nto account for scatter in the tail of the H\u03b4 distribution due to the large intrinsic errors on\nH\u03b4 measurements, while Dressler et al. (1999) do not make such a correction. Secondly,\nwe are comparing a field sample of HDS galaxies to predominantly cluster\u2013selected samples\nof galaxies (were available, we only quote in Table 4 frequencies based on field samples).\nFinally, the luminosity limit of our volume\u2013limited sample is brighter than the high redshift\nstudies, which may account for some of the discrepancies.\nFinally, we note that the original E+A phenomenon in galaxies, as discussed by Dressler\n& Gunn (1983, 1992), was defined to be a galaxy that possessed strong Balmer absorption\nlines, but with no emission lines, i.e., a galaxy with the signature of recent star\u2013formation\nactivity (A stars), but no indication of on\u2013going star\u2013formation (e.g., nebular emission lines).\nGiven the quality of the SDSS spectra, we can re\u2013visit this specific definition and select\ngalaxies from our sample that possess less than 1\u03c3 detections of both the H\u03b1 and [Oii]\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nemission lines, i.e., EW([OII]) + \u2206EW([OII]) \u2265 0\u00c5 and EW(H\u03b1) + \u2206EW(H\u03b1) \u2265 0\u00c5). We\nfind that only 3.5 \u00b1 0.7% (25/717) of galaxies in the volume limited HDS sample satisfy such\na strict criteria (see Table 3). We show example spectra of these galaxies in Figure 16 and\nhighlight them in the catalog using the E+A classification flag. This exercise demonstrates\nthat true E+A galaxies \u2013 with no, or little, evidence for on\u2013going star\u2013formation \u2013 are\nextremely rare at low redshift in the field, i.e., 0.09 \u00b1 0.02% of all SDSS galaxies in our\nvolume\u2013limited sample.\n\n5.2.\n\nHDS Galaxies with Emission\u2013lines\n\nIn this Section, we examine the frequency of nebular emission lines ([Oii], H\u03b1) in the\nspectra of our HDS galaxies. This is possible because of the large spectral coverage of\nthe SDSS spectrographs which allow us to study both the [Oii] and H\u03b1 emission lines\nfor all galaxies out to a redshift of \u2243 0.35. We begin by looking at HDS galaxies that\npossess both the H\u03b1 and [Oii] emission lines. Using the criteria that both [Oii] and\nH\u03b1 lines must be detected at > 1\u03c3 significance (i.e., EW([OII]) + \u2206EW([OII]) < 0\u00c5 and\nEW(H\u03b1) + \u2206EW(H\u03b1) < 0\u00c5), we find that 89\u00b15% (643/717) of HDS galaxies in our volume\u2013\nlimited sample are selected. Of these, 131 HDS galaxies possess a robust detection of an AGN,\nbased on the line indices of Kewley et al. (2001), similar to the AGN plus post\u2013starburst\ngalaxy found recently in the 2dFGRS (see Sadler, Jackson & Cannon 2002). Therefore, a\nmajority of these emission line H\u03b4 galaxies may have on\u2013going star formation and are similar\nto the e(a) and A+em subsample of galaxies discussed by Poggianti et al. (1999) and Balogh\net al. (1999). We show in Figure 17 examples of these HDS galaxies that possess both the\n[Oii] and H\u03b1 emission lines. The median SFR of these galaxies (calculated from H\u03b1 flux,\nsee Kennicut 1998) is \u2243 0.5M\u2299 /yr, with a maximum observed SFR of 50M\u2299 /yr. We note\nthat these SFRs have not been corrected for dust extinction or aperture effects, which could\nresult in them being a factor of 5 to 10 lower than the true SFR for the whole galaxy (see\nHopkins et al. in prep).\nWe next examine the frequency of HDS galaxies with [Oii] emission, but no detectable\nH\u03b1 emission. Using the criteria of EW(H\u03b1) <1 \u03c3 detection and EW([Oii]) > 1\u03c3 detection\n(i.e., EW([OII]) + \u2206EW([OII]) < 0\u00c5 and EW(H\u03b1) + \u2206EW(H\u03b1) \u2265 0\u00c5), we find 2.9\u00b10.65%\n(21/717) of our HDS galaxies in the volume\u2013limited sample satisfy these cuts. The presence\nof [Oii] demonstrates that the galaxy may possess on\u2013going star formation activity, yet the\nlack of the H\u03b1 emission is curious. Possible explanations for this phenomena are strong\nself-absorption of H\u03b1 by the many A stars in the galaxy and/or metallicity effect which\ncould increase the [Oii] emission relative to H\u03b1 emission. We show several examples of\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nthese galaxies in Figure 18, and the lack of H\u03b1 emission is clearly visible. The fact that\nmany of these galaxies possess strong [Nii] lines (flanking the H\u03b1 line) indicates strong\nself\u2013absorption is a likely explanation for the missing H\u03b1 emission line. Median [OII] EW\nof these galaxies is 1.3 \u00c5. Compared with 11.5 \u00c5of HDS galaxies with both [OII] and H\u03b1\nemission, these galaxies have much lower amount of [OII] in emission.\nFinally, we find that 3.8\u00b10.7% (27/717) of our HDS galaxies in our volume\u2013limited sample satisfy the following criteria; EW([OII]) + \u2206EW([OII]) \u2265 0\u00c5 and EW(H\u03b1) + \u2206EW(H\u03b1) < 0\u00c5.\nIn comparison, only 52 of our HDS galaxies, the volume limited sample, have just no [Oii]\nemission detected (only EW([OII]) + \u2206 EW([OII]) \u22650\u00c5). Therefore, 52\u00b112% (27/52) of the\ngalaxies with no detected [Oii], have detected H\u03b1 emission. The existence of such galaxies has ramifications on high redshift studies of post\u2013starburst galaxies, as such studies use\nthe [Oii] line to constrain the amount of on\u2013going star\u2013formation within the galaxies e.g.,\nBalogh et al. (1999), Poggianti et al. (1999). Therefore, if the H\u03b1 emission comes from\nstar\u2013formation activity, then these previous high redshift studies of post starburst galaxies\nmay be contaminated by such galaxies. A possible explanation for the lack of [Oii] emission\nis dust extinction e.g., Miller & Owen (2002) recently found dusty star\u2013forming galaxies\nwhich do not possess [Oii] in emission, but have radio fluxes consistent with on\u2013going star\nformation activity. This explanation would also be consistent with the low signal\u2013to\u2013noise\nwe observe in the blue\u2013end of the SDSS spectra of these galaxies, relative to the signal\u2013\nto\u2013noise seen in the red\u2013end of their spectra. Median H\u03b1 EW of these galaxies are 1.5\u00c5,\nwhereas that of HDS galaxies with both [OII] and H\u03b1 emission is 25.9\u00c5.\n\n6.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe present in this paper the largest, most homogeneous, search yet for H\u03b4\u2013strong galaxies (i.e., post\u2013starburst galaxies, E+A's, k+a's, a+k's etc.) in the local universe. We provide the astronomical community with a new catalog of such galaxies selected from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) based solely on the observed strength of the H\u03b4 Hydrogen Balmer absorption line within the spectrum of the galaxy. We have carefully studied\ndifferent methodologies of measuring this weak absorption line and conclude that a non\u2013\nparametric flux\u2013summing technique is most suited for an automated application to large\ndatasets like the SDSS, and more robust for the observed signal\u2013to\u2013noise ratios available\nin these SDSS spectra. We have studied the effects of dust extinction, emission\u2013filling and\nstellar absorption upon the measurements of our H\u03b4 lines and have determined the external\nerror on our measurements, as a function of signal\u2013to\u2013noise, using duplicate observations\nof 11358 galaxies in the SDSS. In total, our catalog of H\u03b4\u2013selected (HDS) galaxies contains\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n3340 of the 95479 galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (at the time of writing) and we\npresent these HDS galaxies to the community to help in the understanding of such systems\nand to aid in the comparison with higher redshift studies of post\u2013starburst galaxies.\nThe measured abundance of our H\u03b4\u2013selected (HDS) galaxies is 2.6\u00b10.1% of all galaxies\nwithin a volume\u2013limited sample of 0.05 < z < 0.1 and M(r \u2217 )< \u221220.5, which is consistent\nwith previous studies of post\u2013starburst galaxies in the literature. We find that only 25\ngalaxies (3.5\u00b10.7%) of HDS galaxies in this volume limited sample show no, or little, evidence\nfor [Oii] and H\u03b1 emission lines, thus indicating that true E+A galaxies (as originally defined\nby Dressler & Gunn) are extremely rare objects, i.e., only 0.09 \u00b1 0.02% of all galaxies in our\nvolume\u2013limited sample. In contrast, 89 \u00b1 5% of our HDS galaxies have significant detections\nof the [Oii] and H\u03b1 emission lines. Of these, 131 galaxies are robustly classified as Active\nGalactic Nuclei (AGNs) and therefore, a majority of these emission line HDS galaxies are\nstar\u2013forming galaxies, similar to the e(a) and A+em galaxies discussed by Poggianti et al.\n(1999) and Balogh et al. (1999). We will study the global properties of our HDS galaxies in\nfurther detail in future papers.\nWe are indebted to Michael Balogh and Ann Zabludoff who were instrumental in the\ndesign and construction of this sample and have helped us understand the previous literature\non this subject. We also thank Ian Smail and Bianca Poggianti for their enthusiasm for this\nwork and their many discussions about post\u2013starburst galaxies.

The signal\u2013to\u2013noise presented here is the average signal\u2013to\u2013noise per pixel over the\nwavelength range defined by the SDSS photometric g passband. The median signal\u2013to\u2013noise\nvalue is 8.3. Galaxies with signal\u2013to\u2013noise less than 5 were not used in our study.\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\n\nFig. 2.- The H\u03b4 EW (\u00c5) as measured in two different wavelength windows, i.e., the wide\nwindow of Abrahams et al. (1996) and the narrow window of Balogh et al. (1999). The\nexpected one\u2013to\u2013one line is plotted to help guide the eye. For the work presented in this\npaper, absorption lines have a positive EW values and emission lines have negative EW\nvalues.\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- A comparison of the H\u03b4 EW as measured automatically by the SDSS SPECTRO1D\nspectroscopic pipeline (a Gaussian fit to the H\u03b4 line) and the non\u2013parametric summation\ntechnique discussed in this paper and presented in Figure 2. The one\u2013to\u2013one line is shown\nto guide the eye.

In such cases it is\ndifficult to fit the H\u03b4 absorption emission with a single Gaussian due to a centrally peaked\nemission. The double hashed region of this figure, centered on the H\u03b4 line, represents the\nnarrow wavelength window used to measure the EW of H\u03b4 as explained in Section 3.1. The\nslightly wider hashed region, again centered on the H\u03b4 line, represented the wide wavelength\nwindow used to measure the H\u03b4 line (see Section 3.1). Finally, the dashed regions, one on\neach side of the hashed regions, represents the wavelength regions used to estimate the\ncontinuum flux. See also Table 1 for details of the wavelength windows used on measuring\nthe H\u03b4 line.\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\n\n15\n10\n5\n20\n15\n10\n5\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n10\n5\n0\n\nFig. 5.- Five examples of noisy spectra where the SDSS SPECTRO1D pipeline has fit a\nbroad absorption line, thus overestimating the H\u03b4 EW.
