For such resonators, the quantum mechanical level spacing is a few\nmicro-eV, which is comparable to the lowest achievable\ncryogenic temperatures. Freezing out the mechanical degrees of freedom is favorable for ultra sensitive detection\napplications [2] due to reduced effects of thermal fluctuations. Even more spectacular applications can be envisioned if it is possible to cool the mechanical systems\ndown to their motional ground states with high probability. Creation of exotic non-classical states, entanglement\nwith other quantum objects, e.g. spins or atoms, coherent quantum information transfer between quantum\nsub-systems are just a few possibilities. However, reaching the motional ground state using conventional passive\ncooling techniques is practically unfeasible, and therefore other approaches need to be explored. Fortunately,\nthe cooling problem is not unique to nanomechanics; a\nsimilar problem has been encountered and successfully\nsolved in the field of ultra-cold atoms, where by using\nactive cooling approaches it was possible to quench the\nvibrational motion of atoms and reach effective nanoKelvin temperatures [3]. The connection to quantum optics has been recently explored in several works. Hopkins\net al. [4] applied the quantum feedback control ideas to\nnanomechanical resonator cooling. Wilson-Rae et al. [5]\nproposed an analogue of resolved sideband laser cooling\nby coupling the resonator displacement to the level spacing of an attached semiconductor quantum dot, which\nis being irradiated by red-detuned laser. An advantage\nover the feedback-based techniques is that the sideband\ncooling does not require on-the-fly analysis of the output of a nearly ideal detector. On the other hand, direct\nimplementation of the Ref. [5] approach appears rather\nchallenging, from the fabrication stand point and due to\n\nstringent constraints on the quantum dot relaxation rate,\nwhich needs to be slower than the resonator frequency for\nthe vibrational sidebands to be resolved.\nIn this work we study an alternative realization of the\nlaser-like cooling for nanomechanical resonators, where\nthe role of the two-state system is played by a superconducting qubit (Cooper Pair Box, or CPB) capacitively\ncoupled to the resonator. Interaction between the qubit\nand the resonator leads to splitting of the qubit states\ninto equidistant vibrational sidebands. Latest experiments with Josephson qubits showed that long coherence time of the order of microsecond can be achieved\nin special symmetry points [6]. When the qubit relaxation and dephasing rates are smaller than the oscillator frequency, one reaches the resolved sideband regime,\nfavorable for cooling. By tuning microwave source frequency into the first red sideband (qubit level spacing\nminus the oscillator frequency), one can ensure that the\nmicrowave photon absorption processes are preferentially\naccompanied by simultaneous phonon emission from the\nresonator. The cooling cycle is completed when a photon\nis spontaneously emitted at the qubit natural frequency\ninto an external bath. The emitted photon is blue-shifted\nrelative to the source, as it carries away one resonator\nphonon energy. The exact reverse of this process is exponentially suppressed if the qubit level spacing is large\nrelative to temperature, and hence the heating is determined by other \u2013 non-resonant or driving-induced \u2013 processes which are much slower than the dominant cooling\nmechanism. This makes cooling possible. A suggestion\nto use coupled nanoresonator-qubit system for laser-like\ncooling has been first made by Irish and Schwab [7]. Here\nwe consider two implementation of this scheme that use\ndifferent AC driving sources: (1) microwaves directly applied to the CPB or the resonator, in the form of AC\nflux or voltage; (2) the AC Josephson effect on an auxiliary Josephson junction of the qubit. The advantage\nof the second approach is that it only requires DC bias\n\n\f2\ncan use a two state approximation, i.e., |\u2191i \u2261 |Q = 2eN i\nand |\u2193i \u2261 |Q = 2e(N + 1)i and rewrite the Hamiltonian\nusing the Pauli matrices as\nH = 4EC (x) \u03b4N (x) \u03c3z + EC (x)(1 + 4\u03b4N 2 (x))\nEJ\n\u2212\n\u03c3x + Hx ,\n(2)\n2\n\nFIG. 1: The system with AC driving.\n\nfor cooling; however, we find that it is not as effective\nas the AC biasing scheme. In the opposite limit of fast\nCPB relaxation when the vibrational sidebands are not\nresolved, we demonstrate that another type of laser cooling, \"Doppler\" cooling [3], can be performed down to\nthe temperature defined by the quantum dot level width.\nAlthough ground state cooling in this regime is impossible, this technique could be practically attractive for\nnoise reduction in local probe applications (e.g., AFM,\nMFM, and MRFM), where typical resonator frequencies\nare below 1 MHz.\n\nAC COOLING\n\nSystem. The system under consideration is shown in\nFig. 1. A mechanical resonator (horizontal beam) is coupled to a Cooper pair box (yellow rectangle) through capacitance Cx (x), which depends on the resonator displacement x. The charge, and hence the state, of CPB\nis separately controlled by the gate voltage Vg applied to\ncapacitor Cg . CPB is coupled to a large superconductor\nthrough two Josephson junctions. The SQUID geometry\nis chosen to allow for application of an external AC flux\nto the system to provide the AC driving needed for cooling. Similar systems were considered in Refs. [7, 8]. The\nHamiltonian of the system without dissipation reads\nH=\n\n(Q \u2212 Cg Vg \u2212 Cx (x)Vx )2\n\u2212 EJ (\u03a6x ) cos \u03b8 + Hx , (1)\n2C\u03a3\n\nwhere Q is the charge on the island, C\u03a3 \u2261 C + Cg +\nCx (x) is the total capacitance of the island, and Hx \u2261\nm\u03c902 x2\np2\n. The total Josephson energy of the SQUID\n2m +\n2\ncontrolled by an external flux \u03a6x is given by EJ (\u03a6x ) =\n2EJ0 cos(\u03c0\u03a6x /\u03a60 ), where EJ0 is the Josephson energy of\neach of the junctions (we consider a symmetric setup)\nand \u03a60 = h/2e is the (superconducting) flux quantum.\nWe assume the total gate charge Qg \u2261 Cg Vg + Cx (x)Vx\nto be close to an odd number of electron charges, i.e.,\nQg = 2e(N + 1/2) + 2e\u03b4N , where |\u03b4N | \u226a 1/2. Then we\n\nwhere EC (x) \u2261 e2 /2C\u03a3 . The second term in the first\nline of Eq. (2) depends on x and, thus, added to the oscillator Hamiltonian Hx , renormalizes (slightly) the oscillator parameters. This term is also responsible for\nthe direct coupling of the oscillator to the dissipation\nin the circuitry (see below). We, first, drop this term\nfor clarity but later reintroduce it when discussing the\ndirect coupling between the oscillator and the gate voltage fluctuations. Assuming that fluctuations of x are\nsmall relative to the resonator-CPB distance d, we obtain\nCx (x) \u2248 Cx \u2212Cx x/d. Thus \u03b4N (x) \u2248 \u03b4N \u2212Nx x/d, where\nNx \u2261 Cx Vx /2e, and EC (x) \u2248 EC + EC (Cx /C\u03a3 ) (x/d).\nThen the Hamiltonian simplifies to\nH = 4EC \u03b4N \u03c3z \u2212\n\nEJ\n\u03c3x + \u03bb (a\u2020 + a) \u03c3z + h\u0304\u03c90 a\u2020 a , (3)\n2\n\nwhere \u03bb \u2261 \u22124EC [Nx \u2212 \u03b4N (Cx /C\u03a3 )] (\u2206x/d) and \u2206x \u2261\np\nh\u0304/(2m\u03c90 ) is the amplitude of zero point motion, x =\n\u2206x(a\u2020 + a). To increase the coupling one usually applies\nhigh gate voltage Vx so that Nx \u226b 1. Thus, approximately\n\u03bb \u2248 \u22124EC Nx\n\n\u2206x\n.\nd\n\n(4)\n\nBoth gate voltages, Vg and Vx , as well as the external flux \u03a6x fluctuate as they are provided by dissipative sources. This makes \u03b4n and EJ in Eq. (3) fluctuate.\nMoreover, in all real systems there are 1/f charge and\nflux noises. The charge 1/f noise can effectively be added\nto the noise of the gate charge \u03b4N . Experimentally, 1/f\nnoise is the most severe factor limiting coherence. Long\ncoherence times have been achieved in Ref. [6] by operating in a special point where the 1/f noise is less harmful.\nIn the special\npoint, the total energy splitting of the qubit\np\n\u2206E \u2261 (8EC )2 \u03b4N 2 + EJ2 is not sensitive to the fluctuations of \u03b4N and \u03a6x in the linear order. This implies\nh\u03b4N i = 0 and \u2202EJ /\u2202\u03a6x = 0. The fluctuations of \u03b4N\nare, nevertheless, still there and we obtain the following\nHamiltonian characterizing the special point\nEJ\n\u03c3x + h\u0304\u03c90 a\u2020 a + \u03bb (a\u2020 + a) \u03c3z\n2\nX\n\u03c3z + g (a\u2020 + a) X ,\n\u2212\n2\n\nH= \u2212\n\n(5)\n\nwhere X \u2261 \u2212 4Ee C (Cg \u03b4Vg + Cx \u03b4Vx ). By construction the coupling constant \u03bb also contains a fluctuating\npart. We neglect this higher order effect. The fluctuations of voltages \u03b4Vg and \u03b4Vx are caused by external\n\n\f3\nimpedances Z(\u03c9) of the circuits that supply the voltages.\nThe (unsymmetrized) noise power is given by h\u03b4V\u03c92 i \u2261\nh\u03b4V (t)\u03b4V (0)i\u03c9 = [ReZ(\u03c9)]h\u0304\u03c9(coth(h\u0304\u03c9/2kB T )+1). Thus\nthe term X\u03c3z /2 represents the coupling of the system to\nthe harmonic (Gaussian) electromagnetic bath. The situation is similar to the quantum optics one where an atom\nis coupled to electromagnetic vacuum. The main differences are that in our case the coupling is longitudinal, i.e.,\nit does not cause spin flips in the natural (charge) basis,\nand the bath temperature cannot always be neglected.\nThe last term in Eq. (5) is the direct coupling between\nthe bath and the oscillator. It originates from the second\nterm in Eq. (2), and g = Nx \u2206x/d at the symmetry point.\nIn the weak coupling case that we consider, the bath is\nfully characterized by its spectral function, and hence we\ndo not need to include the self-Hamiltonian of the bath\nexplicitly. The non-electromagnetic bath acting on the\nresonator is later introduced through a phenomenological quality factor Q.\nEquilibrium transition rates. To proceed, we first need\nto determine the resonator-qubit system relaxation rates\ncaused by the electromagnetic environment. It is convenient to perform a \u03c0/2 rotation in the x \u2212 z plane,\n\u03c3x \u2194 \u03c3z , to the eigenbasis of the qubit at the symmetry\npoint. The Hamiltonian becomes\nEJ\n\u03c3z + h\u0304\u03c90 a\u2020 a + \u03bb (a\u2020 + a) \u03c3x\n2\nX\n\u03c3x + g (a\u2020 + a) X .\n\u2212\n2\n\nH= \u2212\n\n(6)\n\nWe choose EJ \u226b \u03c90 , \u03bb, T . This ensures that without the\ndriving the spin is all the time in the ground state |\u2191i.\nThe qubit relaxation rate is\n\u0393r \u2261 \u0393\u2193\u2192\u2191 =\n\n2\nhX\u03c9=E\ni\nJ\n\n4h\u03042\n\n\u2248 \u03c0\u03b1g EJ ,\n\n(7)\n\nCx2 +Cg2 R\n2\nRQ ,\nC\u03a3\n\nRQ \u2261 h/4e2 (here we assumed independent\n\u03b4Vg and \u03b4Vx with similar external impedances ReZ(\u03c9) \u2261\nR \u223c 50 \u03a9). The opposite excitation rate is exponentially\nsuppressed.\nThe direct coupling between the bath and the oscillator gives the dissipative rates between the oscillator\n2\nin/h\u03042 and \u0393n\u2192n+1 \u2248\nstates |ni: \u0393n\u2192n\u22121 \u2248 g 2 hX\u03c9=\u03c9\n0\n2\n2\n2\ng hX\u03c9=\u2212\u03c90 i(n + 1)/h\u0304 . In addition, the oscillator can\nrelax via the virtual excitations of the qubit. The corresponding processes are shown in Fig. 2. The rates for\nthese processes are given by\n\n\u0393n\u2192n+1 \u2248\n\n2\ni\n\u03bb2 hX\u03c9=\u03c9\n0\nn,\n2\n2\nEJ\n4h\u0304\n\n2\ni\n\u03bb2 hX\u03c9=\u2212\u03c9\n0\n(n + 1) .\n2\nEJ\n4h\u03042\n\n(8)\n\n/2\n\nFIG. 2: Dissipative processes due to the presence of the qubit:\na) n \u2192 n \u2212 1; b) n \u2192 n + 1. The spectra of the oscillator and\nthe qubit are superimposed.\n\nThese rates are bigger than those due to the direct coupling by a factor (2EC /EJ )2 , and hence the direct coupling term in the Hamiltonian (\u221d g) can be discarded.\nThe above transition rates translate into the resonator\nquality factor caused by the coupling to the electromagnetic bath,\n1\n\u03c0\u03bb2\n= 2 \u03b1g .\nQem\nEJ\n\n(10)\n\nThe charge noise at the (relatively low) frequency\n\u03c9 = \u03c90 may be dominated by the 1/f contribution.\nThe symmetrized correlator of this contribution has been\nstudied, e.g., in echo experiments [9], and one can as2\n2\nsume SX (\u03c9) = (hX\u03c92 i + hX\u2212\u03c9\ni)/2 = E1/f\n/|\u03c9|, where\n\u221a\n\u22127\nE1/f \u2261 4EC \u03b11/f and typically \u03b11/f \u2248 10 . We are\nnot aware of any study of the unsymmetrized correlators. Thus, we will introduce a phenomenological temperature\nT1/f for the\nfrequency \u03c9 = \u03c90 via\n\u0002\n\u0003 particular\n2\n2\ni/hX\nexp \u2212h\u0304\u03c90 /(kB T1/f ) \u2261 hX\u2212\u03c9\n\u03c90 i.

For further analysis we will assume T1/f \u2248 T .\nCooling by applying flux driving\n\nFor cooling we need to drive the system out of equilibrium. We propose to apply an external AC flux,\n\u03a6x (t) = \u03a6x,0 + D\u03a60 cos \u03c9d t, to the qubit. As we operate at the special point where \u2202EJ /\u2202\u03a6x = 0, linear\ndriving is impossible. In the quadratic order, we obtain\nEJ \u2192 EJ + (\u03c0D/2)2 EJ (cos 2\u03c9d t + 1). This gives\nX\nEJ + \u03a9\n\u03c3z \u2212\n\u03c3x + h\u0304\u03c90 a\u2020 a\n2\n2\n\u03a9\n+ \u03bb (a\u2020 + a) \u03c3x \u2212 \u03c3z cos 2\u03c9d t ,\n2\n\nH= \u2212\n(9)\n\n(12)\n\n\f4\n\n/2\n\n/2\n\nFIG. 3: The cooling process.\n\nFIG. 4: The heating process.\n\nwhere \u03a9 = (\u03c0D/2)2 EJ . To describe the cooling process\nwe use the Floquet picture. In other words, we count\nthe number of energy quanta taken from the pumping\nsource. This amounts to substituting the factors e\u00b12\u03c9d t\nby raising/lowering operators e\u00b1\u03c7 (ei\u03c7 |mi = |m + 1i)\nand subtracting the energy taken from the source, 2h\u0304\u03c9m,\nfrom the Hamiltonian. Then the new Hilbert space of the\nproblem is extended as |\u03c3i|ni|mi, where |\u03c3i is the state of\nthe qubit (|\u2191i or |\u2193i), while n is the number of quanta in\nthe resonator. Due to the new term in the Hamiltonian,\n\u22122h\u0304\u03c9d m, an unbound staircase of states appears. Each\nstep of the staircase (Floquet zone) is characterized by\na number m and spans the Hilbert space |\u03c3i |ni. The\nneighboring zones are shifted by energy 2h\u0304\u03c9d relative to\neach other. The states |\u03c3i |ni |mi are the eigenstates of\nthe Hamiltonian\nH0 \u2261 \u2212(EJ + \u03a9) \u03c3z /2 + h\u0304\u03c90 a\u2020 a \u2212 2h\u0304\u03c9d m .\n\n(13)\n\nThe other three terms form the perturbation\nH\u2032 = \u2212\n\nX\n\u03a9\n\u03c3x + \u03bb (a\u2020 + a) \u03c3x \u2212 \u03c3z cos \u03c7 .\n2\n2\n\n(14)\n\nThis perturbation H \u2032 causes transitions inside of each\nzone and also down and up the staircase. At finite (noninfinite) temperature of the bath the down transitions\nprevail and the system propagates down the staircase.\nThis corresponds to the flow of energy from the driving\nsource to the bath. During this flow, the driving source\nquanta of energy can be up- or down-converted in frequency by amount \u03c90 , that is, photons with frequency\n2\u03c9d \u00b1 \u03c90 are emitted into the bath. The former case\ncorresponds to cooling while the latter to heating.\nWe first consider the up-conversion cooling process\nshown in Fig. 3. We choose the optimal detuning so\nthat 2\u03c9d = EJ + \u03a9 \u2212 \u03c90 and the levels |\u2191, n, mi and\n|\u2193, n \u2212 1, m + 1i are degenerate (in what follows we use\nthe units h\u0304 = 1 for brevity). Thus we have to be careful\nwhen calculating the rates. First, we obtain the second\norder matrix element between these two states equal to\n\n\u221a\n\u2206 n where\n\u2206\u2261\n\n\u03a9\u03bb\n.\n2EJ\n\n(15)\n\nNote that the two paths shown in Fig. 3 interfere constructively. Then,\u221athe cooling rate depends on the relation between\n\u2206 n and \u0393r /2. For the weak driving\n\u221a\ncase \u2206 n < \u0393r /2 we have the cooling rate \u0393\u03a9\nn\u2192n\u22121 \u2248\n(4\u22062 /\u0393r ) n (the superscript \u03a9 is to emphasize that this\nrate is due to the driving). To justify this result we consider this process as tunneling from the level |\u2191, n, mi\nto the broadened level |\u2193, n \u2212 1, m + 1i. The retarded\nGreen's function of the second level is then given by\nGR (\u03c9) = 1/(\u03c9 + i\u0393r /2). Using the Golden rule (the\nadiabatic elimination technique[10]), we obtain\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nR\n\u03a9\n2\n\u0393n\u2192n\u22121 = 2\u03c0 \u2206 n \u2212 Im G (\u03c9 = 0)\n\u03c0\n2\n4\u2206\nn.\n(16)\n=\n\u0393r\n\u221a\nIn the opposite, strong driving case, \u2206 n > \u0393r /2, there\nare coherent oscillations between the two levels. The\nappropriate description is then to say that doublets of\nnew\u221aeigenstates, are formed which are split in energy by\n2\u2206 n, see Fig. 5. The doublets\n\u221a are defined for n \u2265 1\nas \u03c8n\u00b1 \u2261 (|n, \u2191i \u00b1 |n \u2212 1, \u2193i)/ 2 and for n = 0 we\nhave a single state \u03c8n=0 \u2261 |0, \u2191i. There are four possible transitions between each state of the doublet and\neach state of another doublet shifted as n \u2192 n \u2212 1 and\nm \u2192 m + 1. All four rates are equal \u0393r /4. In total this\ngives \u0393\u03a9\nn\u2192n\u22121 \u2248 \u0393r /2. To summarize,\n\u001a\n\u221a\n(4\u22062 /\u0393r ) n\nif \u2206\u221an < \u0393r /2\n\u03a9\n.

Taking into account the internal dissipation of the resonator with quality factor Q, one can [5]\nwrite down the master equation for the probability Pn to\nfind the resonator in the state |ni.

As this is the relevant regime for realistic parameters we will analyze only\nthis case. Interestingly, however, in the opposite case of\nvery high Q, when \u03c90 /Q \u226a (\u22062 /8\u03c902 ) \u0393r , the cooling rate\naccelerates until hni \u2248 1.\nIf h\u00f1i \u226b 1 (to be checked for self-consistency) the probability to be in the ground state is negligible, D0 \u226a 1.\nThen\nhni \u2248 nB (\u03c90 ) \u2212\n\n(\u0393r \u2212 \u0393e )Q\n.\n2\u03c90\n\n(26)\n\nThis regime, thus, is realized when nB (\u03c90 ) > (\u0393r \u2212\n\u0393e )Q/(2\u03c90 ). Clearly, for at least some cooling we need\n(\u0393r \u2212 \u0393e ) \u226b (2\u03c90 )/Q. At lower temperatures, Eq.

In this regime h\u00f1i \u2248 2hni (see\nEq.(24)), therefore 1 \u2212 D0 \u223c 2hni.

Clearly, T \u2217 is the lowest possible temperature\nfor a given cooling process, which is achieved for \u03b3 \u2217 \u226b \u03b30 .\nThe combined damping coefficient \u03b3 = \u03b30 +\u03b3 \u2217 determines\nthe rate of relaxation to the new stationary state.\nExample. We consider a nanomechanical resonator\nwith fundamental frequency 100 MHz (\u03c90 = 2\u03c0 \u00d7\n100 MHz = 0.5 \u03bceV) and quality factor Q = 105 . It\nis coupled to the qubit, which is characterized by the\nJosephson energy EJ \u2248 50 \u03bceV and Coulomb charging\n\n\f7\nThe ac voltage Vx generates resonant coupling between\nthe mechanical resonator and the CPB when \u03c9ac = EJ \u2212\n\u03c90 , which corresponds to the first red sideband coupling\nin quantum optics. The voltage Vx also generates an\noscillating charge bias on the CPB with \u03b4Ngx = Cx Vx /2e;\nhowever, it is balanced by the bias Vg , which prevents\nharmful ac pumping of the CPB.\nThe scheme.

The coupling is\n\u03bb = \u22124Ec\n\nenergy EC \u2248 160 \u03bceV (corresponds to C\u03a3 \u2248 500 aF). The\ncoupling strength between the resonator and the qubit\nis determined by the mutual capacitance Cx \u2248 20 aF,\nand the gate voltage Vx \u2248 1 V, such that nx \u2248 60\nCooper pairs (see Ref. [8]). The gap between the resonator and the CPB is d \u2248 100 nm. For these parameters, from Eq. 4, the resonator-CPB coupling strength is\n\u03bb \u2248 0.1 \u03bceV. Assuming that Cg < Cx , for the relaxation\nrate of CPB we find \u0393r = 3 * 10\u22123 \u03bceV.\nThe circuit-induced quality factor of the resonator is\nQem \u2248 4 * 109 , which is significantly higher than the quality factors of typical resonators. For the 1/f contribution at T1/f > 10 \u03c90 we obtain Q1/f > 107 , which is\nstill higher than a typical value. Hence this modification\nof the oscillator damping can be neglected compared to\nother environmental effects.\nFor cooling, we take \u03a9 \u2248 1 \u03bceV, which corresponds\nto the modulation depth D = 0.1. We thus obtain\n\u221a\n\u2206 \u2248 10\u22123 \u03bceV, and hence for all n we have \u2206 n >\n\u0393/2 and \u0393\u03a9\nn\u2192n\u22121 \u2248 \u0393r /2 (strong driving regime). The\nheating is indeed dominated by 1/f noise, with \u0393e =\n2\n(\u03a9/2EJ )2 (E1/f\n/4\u03c90 ) \u2248 1.8 * 10\u22126 \u03bceV. In this regime we\nget the following results for cooling:\n\uf8f1\nif nB (\u03c90 ) > 300\n\uf8f2 nB (\u03c90 ) \u2212 300\nif 0.33 < nB (\u03c90 ) < 300\nhni = 1.5 * 10\u22123 nB (\u03c90 )\n\uf8f3\n0.5 * 10\u22123\nif nB (\u03c90 ) < 0.33\n\nThe exact numerical solution of the rate equations\nEq. (22) is shown in Figure 8.\nCooling by applying voltage driving\n\nAnother way to achieve AC cooling is by applying radio\nfrequency voltage bias to the gates. In Fig. 1, apply a\ndriving voltage Vx = V0 cos \u03c9d t on the resonator and\nanother driving voltage Vg = \u2212(Cx /Cg )Vx on the CPB.\n\n(34)\n\nCx V0 \u2206x\n.\n2e d\n\n(35)\n\nSimilar to the ac flux driving setup, we analyze the sideband cooling (\u03c90 \u226b \u03bb, \u0393r ) in the regimes of weak driving\nand the strong driving; both can be reached in experiments.\nThe analysis is essentially the same as that in the flux\ndriving case. Instead of the second order matrix element\n\u2206 (see Eq. (15)), we have the direct coupling \u03bb/2. Thus\nto obtain the cooling and the heating rates we substitute\n\u2206 \u2192 \u03bb/2 into Eqs. (17) and (18). In this scheme there\nis no driving induced contribution of the low frequency\n(1/f ) noise similar to (20).\nStrong\n\u221a driving. The strong driving regime is achieved\nfor \u03bb n/2 \u226b \u0393r /2. As the 1/f noise does not contribute to the heating, i.e., the rates (20) do not appear,\nthe leading heating mechanism is the off-resonance coupling (see Eq. (18)). Thus, the dynamics is described\nby the rate equation (22) with \u0393e = 0. We obtain the\ncooling results as follows: For nB > Q(\u0393r /2\u03c90 ) we obtain hni \u2248 nB \u2212 Q(\u0393r /2\u03c90 ). In the intermediate regime\nQ(\u0393r /2\u03c90 ) > nB > Q(\u0393r /\u03c90 )(\u03bb/4\u03c90 )2 the result is\nhni \u2248 \u03c90 nB /Q\u0393r . Finally, for nB < Q(\u0393r /\u03c90 )(\u03bb/4\u03c90 )2 ,\nthe occupation number saturates at hni \u2248 (\u03bb/4\u03c90 )2 .\nFor example, let \u0393r = 5 * 10\u22123 \u03bceV, \u03bb = 25 * 10\u22123 \u03bceV\n(with the voltage bias V0 \u223c 50 mV ) and Q = 105 . We\nhave (\u03bb/4\u03c90 )2 \u0393r \u2248 8 * 10\u22127 \u03bceV. The stationary occupation number is\n\uf8f1\nif nB (\u03c90 ) > 500\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 nB (\u03c90 ) \u2212 500\n\u22123\nhni \u2248\n10 nB (\u03c90 )\nif 0.15 < nB (\u03c90 ) < 500\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u22124\n1.5 * 10\nif nB (\u03c90 ) < 0.15\nwhich gives hni = 2.5 *10\u22123\n\u221a at the temperature of 20 mK.\nWeak driving. For \u03bb n/2 \u226a \u0393r /2, the dynamics\nof the resonator is described by the rate equation (31)\nwith A\u2212 = \u03bb2 /\u0393r and A+ = (\u03bb/4\u03c90 )2 \u0393r . Note that\nthe low frequency noise doesn't appear in this scheme\n(\u0393e = 0), which improves the cooling efficiency. For\n\n\f8\nnB (\u03c90 ) < A+ Q/\u03c90 the average occupation is given by\nhni = A+ /A\u2212 ; for nB (\u03c90 ) > A+ Q/\u03c90 we obtain hni =\nnB (\u03c90 )\u03c90 /A\u2212 Q. As an example, let \u0393r = 50 * 10\u22123 \u03bceV,\n\u03bb = 5 * 10\u22123 \u03bceV (with the bias voltage of V0 \u223c 10 mV\n) and Q = 105 . We have A\u2212 = 0.5 * 10\u22123 \u03bceV and\nA+ = 3 * 10\u22127 \u03bceV. Then, the cooling results are as follows:\n(\n10\u22122 nB (\u03c90 ), nB (\u03c90 ) > 0.06\nhni =\n(36)\n6 * 10\u22124 ,\nnB (\u03c90 ) < 0.06\nwhere at the temperature of 20 mK with nB (\u03c90 ) = 5, we\nhave hni = 0.05. Thus better cooling can be achieved in\nthe strong driving regime than that in the weak driving\nregime.\nDiscussion. The relaxation rate \u0393r can be adjusted\nby varying the external circuit of the CPB. For example,\nby varying the gate capacitance Cg , the relaxation rate\nchanges as \u0393r \u221d Cg2 . The coupling constant \u03bb can be adjusted by varying the bias V0 . In this scheme, we choose\nV0 to be in the range of 10 . . . 100 mV and \u0393r in the range\nof (1 . . . 100) * 10\u22123\n\u221a\u03bceV, which includes both the weak\nn/2 \u226a \u0393r /2) and the strong driving\ndriving regime\n(\u03bb\n\u221a\nregime (\u03bb n/2 \u226b \u0393r /2). These parameter regimes have\nbeen realized in charge qubit experiments.\nOne practical issue of this scheme concerns the accuracy of the gate compensation. Both gate voltages\ngenerate an extra part of the CPB's charging energy\n\u03b4H = 4Ec \u03b4ng \u03c3x , with \u03b4ng = (Cx Vx + Cg Vg ) /2e. By\ncontrolling the voltage with an accuracy of microvolts,\nwhich can be achieved with standard technology, the oscillating bias on the CPB can be neglected.\nCompared with the ac flux driving cooling scheme in\nthis paper, the resonator can now be cooled to a lower\ntemperature because the heating process only involves\nthe electromagnetic noise of the circuit at frequency EJ ,\nwhile the low frequency noise, which is the dominant\nheating factor in the previous scheme, doesn't affect the\nsystem.\nDC COOLING\n\nEffectively, AC driving can be achieved applying a DC\ntransport voltage to an auxiliary Josephson junction. We\nmodify the system as shown in Fig. 9 so that it becomes\neffectively an SET transistor. Dissipative Cooper pair\nand quasi-particle transport is similar systems was considered in Refs. [11, 12]. The Hamiltonian in the charge\nbasis reads\n(Q \u2212 CR V \u2212 Cg Vg \u2212 Cx (x)Vx )2\n2C\u03a3\n\u2212 EJ,L cos \u03b8 \u2212 EJ,R cos(\u03b8 + 2eV t/h\u0304) + Hx , (37)\n\nH =\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the phase on the island (and simultaneously\non the left junction as the left lead is grounded), C\u03a3 \u2261\n\nFIG. 9: The system with DC driving.\n\nCL + CR + Cg + Cx (x). Due to the transport voltage V ,\nthe Hamiltonian is time dependent and, thus, represents\na driven system. We repeat the steps described above\nand arrive (in the charge basis) at\nX\nEJ,L\n\u03c3x \u2212\n\u03c3z + h\u0304\u03c90 a\u2020 a + \u03bb (a\u2020 + a) \u03c3z\n2\n2\nEJ,R\n(\u03c3+ ei\u03c9J t+i\u03b4\u03c6 + h.c.) ,\n(38)\n\u2212\n2\n\nH= \u2212\n\nwhere RX \u2261 \u2212 4Ee C (CR \u03b4V + Cg \u03b4Vg + Cx \u03b4Vx ), \u03b4\u03c6 \u2261\n(2e/h\u0304) \u03b4V dt, and the Josephson frequency \u03c9J \u2261\n2eV /h\u0304. We see that the right junction's Josephson energy\nassumes the role of pumping amplitude \u03a9, while \u03c9J is the\npumping frequency. Unfortunately V is noisy and, thus,\nthe pumping source has a substantial line-width. The\ntransport voltage should not be sensitive to the background charges, therefore V is assumed to have Ohmic\nnoise spectrum (no 1/f component).\nAfter a \u03c0/2 rotation in the x \u2212 z plane, \u03c3x \u2194 \u03c3z , we\nobtain\nEJ,L\nX\n\u03c3z \u2212\n\u03c3x + h\u0304\u03c90 a\u2020 a + \u03bb (a\u2020 + a) \u03c3x\n2\n2\n\u0001\nEJ,R\n(\u03c3z + i\u03c3y ) ei\u03c9J t+i\u03b4\u03c6 + h.c. .\n(39)\n\u2212\n4\n\nH= \u2212\n\nWhile the Hamiltonians (12) and (39) look similar,\nthere are two important differences. One, already discussed, is the fact that the pumping frequency \u03c9J in\n(39) is fundamentally noisy, while \u03c9d in (12) can be\nmade coherent. The second (very important) difference\nis that in (12) the pumping is applied to \u03c3z only, while\nin (39) it couples to \u03c3z and \u03c3y . Both these facts hinder the cooling. Indeed, the coupling to \u03c3y gives a direct matrix element EJ,R /4 between the states |\u2191, n, mi\nand |\u2193, n, m + 1i. This interaction repels the levels and\nwe must choose EJ,R \u226a 4\u03c90 so that the resonant detuning as in Fig. 3 is possible. In addition, the noise\nof the transport voltage translates into the line width\nfor the transition |\u2191, n, mi \u2192 |\u2193, n \u2212 1, m + 1i equal to\n\n\f9\n\u0393\u03c6 = 2\u03c0\u03b1tr kB T /h\u0304, where \u03b1tr \u2261 R/RQ . The fluctuations\nof the transport voltage are not screened by the ratio of\ncapacitances as it happens for the gate charge. Therefore \u03b1tr \u2248 10\u22122 . Because of these additional constraints\nthe applicability of the DC cooling scheme is limited to\nhigher frequency/quality factor resonators. For an estimate, consider an oscillator with \u03c90 = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 1 GHz \u2248\n5 \u03bceV \u2248 50 mK at temperature T = 50 mK. We then\nobtain \u0393\u03c6 \u2248 0.3 \u03bceV, which significantly exceeds \u0393r .\nHence, we have to substitute \u0393r by \u0393\u03c6 in all formulas. For the Josephson coupling in the right junction\nwe take EJ,R = 2 \u03bceV. Then, instead of Eq. (15), we find\n\u2206 \u2248 EJ,R \u03bb/(2EJ,L ) \u2248 2 * 10\u22123 \u03bceV (we assume EJ,L \u2248\n50 \u03bceV). The cooling rate can again be represented as\nA\u2212 n, where A\u2212 \u2248 2\u22062 /\u0393\u03c6 \u2248 2 * 10\u22125 \u03bceV. Thus, cooling\nbecomes possible only if Q > \u03c90 /A\u2212 \u2248 2.5 * 105 .\n\nAlso, in the dissipative term HX \u2261 \u2212(X/2)\u03c3x, we find\na slow contribution:\n\nDISCUSSION AND COMPARISON WITH\nQUANTUM OPTICS.\n\nFor comparison with quantum optics cooling schemes,\nwe present here an analysis of some of the processes described above using the quantum optics language. In\nquantum optics literature one usually employs the transformation to the rotating frame and/or other canonical transformations together with the Rotating Wave\nApproximation (RWA) in order to single out the near\nresonant terms responsible for the studied transitions.\nWe start with Hamiltonian (12) and transform it into\nthe interaction representation with respect to H0 (t) \u2261\n\u2212[EJ + \u03a9 + \u03a9 cos 2\u03c9d t] \u03c3z /2 + \u03c90 a\u2020 a. This amounts to\n\u03a9\nsin 2\u03c9d t)\n\u2212i(EJ t+\u03a9t+ 2\u03c9\n\nand a \u2192 ae\u2212i\u03c90 t .\n(40)\nAs \u03a9 \u226a 2\u03c9d \u223c EJ we can expand the factor\nexp(\u2212i(\u03a9/2\u03c9d) sin 2\u03c9d t). The near resonant (RWA)\nparts of the coupling term H\u03bb \u2261 \u03bb(a\u2020 + a)\u03c3x read, then,\nafter the transformation as\n\u03c3+ \u2192 \u03c3+ e\n\nH\u03bbRWA = \u2212\n\nd\n\n\u03a9\u03bb\n(a\u03c3\u2212 + a\u2020 \u03c3\u2212 e2\u03c90 t + h.c.) ,\n4\u03c9d\n\nFIG. 10: Level structure of the voltage driving scheme for ac\ncooling. The solid lines indicate the cooling process; and the\ndotted lines indicate the heating process.\n\n(41)\n\nwhere the resonance condition 2\u03c9d = EJ + \u03a9 \u2212 \u03c90 was\nassumed. The first term of (41) clearly corresponds to\nthe\n\u221a resonant transition provided by the matrix element\n\u2206 n (see Eq. (15)). The second term corresponds to the\noff-resonant transition. In analogy with atom optics [3],\nwe can introduce Lamb-Dicke parameter \u03b7 \u2261 \u03bb/2\u03c9d \u2248\n\u03bb/EJ . Note that, unlike the case of trapped atoms/ions\nwe do not have near resonant terms flipping just the spin,\n\u223c \u03a9\u03c3\u00b1 exp(\u00b1i\u03c90 ). Such an interaction would repel the\nlevels, and, for a resonant detuning, one would need \u03a9 \u226a\n\u03c90 . In our case, a much stronger driving is allowed. We\ndo, however, encounter this limitation in the DC cooling\nscheme due to the presence of the near-resonant term in\nthe Hamiltonian Eq. (39) which is proportional to \u03c3y .\n\nslow\nHX\n=\n\n\u0001\nX \u03a9\n\u03c3\u2212 ei\u03c90 t + h.c. ,\n2 4\u03c9d\n\n(42)\n\nwhich is responsible for the heating process (18) dominated by the low frequency noise. In quantum optics\nthis contribution is typically neglected as there are no\nstrong low frequency sources.\nIn the case of ac voltage cooling, in the rotating wave\napproximation the Hamiltonian is\nh\u0304\u03c90\n\u03c3z + h\u0304\u03c90 \u00e2\u2020 \u00e2\n2\n\u0001\n\u03bb\n+ \u00e2\u2020 \u03c3+ + \u00e2\u03c3\u2212 + \u00e2\u2020 \u03c3\u2212 + \u00e2\u03c3+ (43)\n2\n\u0001\nX\u0302\n\u2212\n\u03c3+ e\u2212i\u03c9d t + \u03c3\u2212 ei\u03c9d t\n2\n\nH RW A = \u2212\n\nwhere the interaction includes the resonant coupling\n\u00e2\u2020 \u03c3+ + \u00e2\u03c3\u2212 between the states |\u2191, ni and |\u2193, n \u2212 1i, and\nthe off resonant coupling \u00e2\u2020 \u03c3\u2212 + \u00e2\u03c3+ between the states\n|\u2191, ni and |\u2193, n + 1i with an energy difference of 2h\u0304\u03c90 .\nThe time dependence in the last term shows that only\nhigh frequency fluctuations on the order of EJ induces\nrelaxation.\nThe voltage driving scheme for ac cooling presents a\ndirect analogue to the laser cooling of quantum optics\nsystems as is obvious from Fig. 10; however, it is a simpler scheme as the coupling is a direct bilinear coupling\ninstead of the polaron coupling in quantum optics.\n\n\"DOPPLER\" COOLING\n\nFor smaller oscillator frequencies \u03c90 and/or larger\nqubit relaxation rates \u0393r , it may happen that the vibrational sidebands are no longer resolved, i.e., \u0393r > \u03c90 .\nThen, cooling to the ground state is impossible but the\n\n\f10\nless effective \"Doppler\" cooling is still feasible. In the\nstandard Doppler cooling, cold atoms moving in a laser\nfield experience different light pressure depending on\ntheir velocity. For instance, if the laser is red-detuned\nrelative to the atomic transition, then atom moving towards the light source will be absorbing photons more\nthan an atom moving away from the source, which will\nresult in a velocity-dependent force on the atom. By\nproperly arranging multiple lasers it is then possible to\nachieve significant reduction of the atom's effective temperature. The same reasoning applies to an atom in\na trap, when the trap frequency is much smaller than\nthe atomic transition line width. Equivalently, in this\ncase, the Doppler cooling can be reinterpreted in terms\nof the cooling and heating transition rates for the oscillating atom. For red-detuned laser, photon absorption\nprocesses with simultaneous phonon emission dominate\nthe ones where an additional phonon is created. One can\nshow that, similar to the free atom case, this leads to\ncooling down to temperatures proportional to the atomic\ntransition line width. In this section we will demonstrate\nthat an analog of Doppler cooling can be performed in\nboth AC and DC cooling setups described in the previous\nsections in the regime of non-resolved sidebands.\nAC cooling scheme. We start with the AC-driving\nscheme described by Hamiltonian (12). In the Doppler\ncase it is enough to study, first, the spin's dynamics without the oscillator. We perform the following transformation\n\u03c3+ \u2192 \u03c3+ e\n\n\u03a9\n\u2212i(2\u03c9d t+ 2\u03c9\nsin 2\u03c9d t)\nd\n\n,\n\n(44)\n\nand keep only the RWA terms in the coherent part of the\nHamiltonian but all the terms in the part describing the\ninteraction with the bath. The transformed Hamiltonian\nreads\nRWA\nHspin\n=\n\n\u03b4\u03c9\nX\n\u03a9 X\n\u03c3z \u2212\n(\u03c3+ e\u22122i\u03c9d t + h.c.) +\n\u03c3x ,\n2\n2\n4\u03c9d 2\n(45)\n\nwhere \u03b4\u03c9 is the detuning \u03b4\u03c9 \u2261 2\u03c9d \u2212 EJ \u2212 \u03a9. The last\nterm in the Hamiltonian, as before (see Eqs. (19) and\n(18)), generates transitions between the ground and excited states of the qubit. The corresponding rate, however, is typically much smaller than the relaxation rate\ngenerated by the second term of the Hamiltonian, and\nhence can be neglected. This is in contrast to the AC\nground states cooling scheme discussed above, where the\nqubit heating rate determined the lowest possible occupation number of the resonator.

For the same parameters as used in the AC cooling\nsection, we find that at the optimal detuning Q\u2217 \u223c 1,\nwhich corresponds to a nearly overdamped regime, similar to optical molasses in atom optics. Hence, a resonator\nwith a frequency \u03c90 <\n\u223c \u0393r /2 = 300 kHz can be cooled\ndown to temperature Tmin \u2248 \u0393r /4 \u223c 10 \u03bcK. Note, that\nthe effect of the dominant qubit heating mechanism due\nto the 1/f noise, which we neglected here, if necessary,\ncan be managed by reducing the driving strength \u03a9 (at\nthe expense of reduced cooling power, i.e. larger Q\u2217 ).\nSimilar analysis applies to the voltage driving\u221ascheme\nfor AC cooling in the Doppler regime.

Analysis of the DC cooling scheme\nproceeds analogously. We start with Hamiltonian (39)\nand perform transformation\n\u03c3+ \u2192 \u03c3+ e\n\n\u2212i(\u03c9J t+ \u03c9\u03a9 sin \u03c9J t)\nJ\n\n,\n\n(58)\n\nwhere, for now, \u03a9 \u2261 EJ,R , and we remind that \u03c9J \u2261\n(2e/h\u0304)V . For simplicity we consider V noiseless now but\nlater will introduce the low-frequency (classical) noise of\nV . Then, we obtain\n\u03b4\u03c9\n\u03a9\n\u03c3z \u2212 \u03c3x\n2\n4\n\u03a9 X\nX\n(\u03c3+ e\u2212V t + h.c.) +\n\u03c3x ,\n\u2212\n2\n2V 2\n\n0\n\ni\u03a9\n2\n\n0\n\ni\u03b4\u03c9 \u2212 \u0393\u0303\n\nwhere \u0393\u0303 = \u0393\u03c6 + \u0393r /2. The general expressions for Sx\nand \u03b7x are quite complicated. An analysis shows that the\nsimplest cooling regime is achieved when \u03a9 \u226a \u0393r \u2248 \u0393\u03c6 .\nThat is, it does not make sense to keep small \u0393r when the\nline width is anyway given by large \u0393\u03c6 . The relaxation\nrate \u0393r can easily be increased by choosing bigger gate\ncapacitances Cx and/or Cg . Assuming \u0393r = \u0393\u03c6 and \u03a9 \u226a\n\u0393\u03c6 we obtain\nSx =\n\n12 \u0393\u03c6\n,\n4\u03b4\u03c9 2 + 9 \u03932\u03c6\n\n(61)\n\n96\u03b4\u03c9 \u0393\u03c6\n.\n(4\u03b4\u03c9 2 + 9 \u03932\u03c6 )2\n\n(62)\n\nand\n\n\u03bb2 \u0393r\n\n(56)\nwhere \u03b4\u03c9 = \u03c9d \u2212 EJ is the detuning of the driving frequency from the qubit's ground-to-excited-state transition. Cooling is achieved when \u03b4\u03c9 < 0. Neglecting the\neffect of the finite intrinsic Q-factor, the final phonon\nnumber from Eq. (32) is\n\u03932r\n\nthe extra matrix element in the DC scheme); ii) the detuning \u03b4\u03c9 is noisy due to the noise of V . This will give\nan extra \"pure\" dephasing rate \u0393\u03c6 = 2\u03c0\u03b1tr kB T /h\u0304, where\n\u03b1tr \u2261 R/RQ . As in the AC Doppler case, neglecting the\nexcitation rate coming from the last term in the Hamiltonian, for the Redfield tensor we obtain\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0\n0\n0\n0\ni\u03a9\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec \u0393r \u2212\u0393r\n\u2212 i\u03a9\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n4\n4\n(60)\nR=\uf8ec 2\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed 0 \u2212 i\u03a9\n0\n2 \u2212i\u03b4\u03c9 \u2212 \u0393\u0303\n\n\u03b7x = \u2212\n\nOptimizing with respect to \u03b4\u03c9, we find that the minimum\ntemperature Tmin \u2248 (3/4)\u0393\u03c6 is achieved for the optimal\ndetuning \u03b4\u03c9 \u2248 \u2212(3/2)\u0393\u03c6. The effective quality factor\ndue to the cooling environment, similarly to (55), is\n\u03a92 \u03bb2 \u03b7x\n1\n=\n.\nQ\u2217\n2\u03c9J2\n\n(63)\n\nThe regime \u0393r \u226a \u0393\u03c6 is more subtle and requires further\nanalysis.\nExample: Choosing Cx \u2248 200 aF instead of previously\nassumed 20 aF, we obtain \u0393r \u2248 0.3 \u03bceV \u2248 \u0393\u03c6 . We choose\n\u03a9 = EJ,R \u2248 0.1 \u03bceV (note that this is quite a small value\nfor usual Josephson junctions). Then we obtain Tmin \u2248\n0.25 \u03bceV \u2248 2.5 mK for \u03b4\u03c9 \u2248 0.5 \u03bceV \u2248 2\u03c0 \u00d7 100 MHz.\nNear optimal detuning point, we obtain \u03b7x \u2248 6 (\u03bceV)\u22122 .\nFor the coupling constant \u03bb we can take \u03bb \u2248 1 \u03bceV instead of 0.1 \u03bceV as we have allowed ten times bigger capacitance Cx . Then we obtain Q\u2217 \u2248 0.8 * 105 . Thus, for\ncooling to be effective, resonator Q-factor should exceed\n105 and the final resonator temperature is determined\naccording to Eq. (33) with T \u2217 = 2.5 \u03bcK.\n\nRWA\nHspin\n=\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n(59)\n\nwhere \u03b4\u03c9 \u2261 \u03c9J \u2212 EJ,L . The main differences with (45)\nare: i) the second term of (59) is absent in (45) (recall\n\nWe considered several approaches to active cooling of\nmechanical resonators using a coupling to a superconducting Josephson qubit. In the resolved vibrational\n\n\f12\nsideband regime, when the qubit level width is smaller\nthan the resonator frequency, we proposed two schemes\nfor ground-state cooling of the resonator. In the first\nscheme, the AC driving required for cooling is provided\nby an external microwave source. We find that for a 100\nMHz oscillator coupled to a practically realizable Josephson qubit, at the external temperatures below 1 K, it is\npossible to reduce the thermal occupancy of the oscillator\nmode by three order of magnitude. In the second scheme,\nthe AC driving is generated by the AC Josephson oscillations on an auxiliary junction of the qubit. This scheme\nis attractive since there is no need for an external AC\ndriving source; however, in the present realization, we\nfind that it is not as effective as the one with an explicitly applied AC driving. We also demonstrate that even\nin the regime when the vibrational sidebands are not resolved, it is possible to perform an analogue of Doppler\ncooling with the final resonator temperature limited by\nthe qubit line width.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe would like to acknowledge useful discussions with\nK.
