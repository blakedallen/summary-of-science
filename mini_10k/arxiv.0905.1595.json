Application to the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0\u03c0 data on the\nX(4260) enhancement recently reported by the BABAR Collaboration [1] allows a good fit\nwith a simple nonresonant cusp structure around the Ds\u2217 Ds\u2217 threshold. Moreover, we argue\nthat a closer look at the data reveals an oscillatory pattern, which we model as an interference effect between a fast - OZI-allowed - and a slow - OZI-forbidden - J/\u03c8 f0 (980)\nmode. Other candidates for similar nonresonant enhancements are discussed.\n\nRecently, the BABAR Collaboration presented new preliminary data for the reaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192\nJ/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [1]. These data exhibit a much more pronounced peak in the X(4260) [2] region\nthan in the first BABAR observation of this structure [3], besides a rather constant signal for\nthe remaining invariant masses [4]. The new experimental analysis\u0010of the X(4260)\nusing a\n\u0011\n+2\nnonrelativistic Breit-Wigner parametrization yielded a mass of M = 4252 \u00b1 6\u22123 MeV and a\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nwidth of \u0393 = 105 \u00b1 18+4\n\u22126 MeV.\nThe X(4260) enhancement was confirmed, and also seen in the processes \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 J/\u03c8 as well as\nK + K \u2212 J/\u03c8, by the CLEO collaboration [5], whereas the Belle Collaboration observed a similar\nstructure in J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [6]. On the theoretical side [7\u20139], a variety of model explanations have\nbeen suggested, such as a standard vector charmonium state (4S) [10], a mesonic or baryonic\nmolecule [11], a gluonic excitation (hybrid) [12], or a cqc\u0304q\u0304 state [13].\nIt was also noticed [14] that the Belle data [6] reveal a curious \u03c0\u03c0 mass spectrum in the\nm\u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 J/\u03c8 invariant-mass region of 4.2\u20134.4 GeV, which was confirmed by the BABAR Collaboration in Ref. [1].\n1\n\n\fA remarkable aspect of this experimental observation is that the main signal of e+ e\u2212 \u2192\n\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 coincides with the Ds\u2217 Ds\u2217 threshold [4], and furthermore that very little D D\u0304 production\nhas been observed in the 4.26 GeV region [15]. Here, we shall first pay some attention to the\nlatter phenomenon, then discuss the relation of the X(4260) signal to the opening of Ds\u2217 Ds\u2217 ,\nfinally and present a possible explanation for the \u03c0\u03c0 mass spectrum.\nIt has been observed [15,16] that D D\u0304 production in e+ e\u2212 annihilation is suppressed at invariant masses far above the production threshold for D D\u0304. Branching fractions have been measured\nat 4.028 GeV with the SLAC/LBL magnetic detector at SPEAR [17]. The results suggest that\nthe opening of a channel is followed by a rather fast fading out of the same channel at higher\ninvariant masses. In Refs. [18, 19], it was shown that this feature can be parametrized for the\ntotal cross section \u03c3 by a simpel Gaussian form factor, which for P -waves suggests the expression\n2\n\u03c3 \u221d |pr0 | e\u2212 |pr0 | ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere p stands for the two-particle linear momentum and r0 represents a distance parameter.\nIn Table 1, we show some results of formula (1) for the branching fractions of pairs of neutral\ncharmed mesons at 4.028 GeV, produced in e+ e\u2212 annihilation. We observe that expression (1)\nchannels\n\nr0 = 3.2 GeV\u22121\n\nr0 = 3.8 GeV\u22121\n\nexperiment [17]\n\nD 0 D 0 /D 0 D \u22170\n\n0.021\n\n0.007\n\n0.05\u00b10.035\n\nD 0 D 0 /D \u22170 D \u22170\n\n0.0023\n\n0.0002\n\n0.0016\u00b10.0014\n\nD 0 D \u22170 /D \u22170 D \u22170\n\n0.11\n\n0.033\n\n0.031\u00b10.016\n\nTable 1: Branching fractions for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 D0 D0 , D0 D\u22170 , and D\u22170 D\u22170 at 4.028 GeV, obtained by\n\nthe use of formula (1), including the ratios which stem from the three-meson verticex couplings, viz.\nP P : P V : V V = 1 : 4 : 7 (P =pseudoscalar, V =vector meson), and compared to the results of\nGoldhaber et al. [17].\n\nallows a reasonable agreement with experiment. This may explain why so few D D\u0304 pairs are\nobserved at 4.26 GeV [15], as this channel opens at 3.74 GeV. It supports the idea that channels\nget effectively damped at invariant masses far above their thresholds. This phenomenon may be\nunderstood as the manifestation of boost effects on the wave functions of the produced mesons\n[20]. Consequently, near the X(4260) we may restrict ourselves to the opening of the Ds\u2217 Ds\u2217\nchannel. As for the possible alternatives in this energy region, the DD1 (2420) [21] threshold at\nabout 4.29 GeV lies somewhat too high, while the DD1 (2430) channel, involving the very broad\nD1 (2430) [2] resonance, cannot give rise to the rather sharp X(4260) enhancement either. Also\nthe suggested [21] D \u2217 D0\u2217 (2400) threshold at roughly 4.3\u20134.4 GeV [2], with the very broad scalar\ncharm meson D0\u2217 , is way too smeared out to produce a narrow signal at about 4.25 GeV\nIn Refs. [4, 22], it was observed that cc\u0304 resonances show up as dips in the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8\ncross section, and not as resonance peaks. Furthermore, in Ref. [4] we showed that also at the\nopening of channels, in particular open-charm baryonic channels, dips appear in the e+ e\u2212 \u2192\n\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 cross section.\n\n2\n\n\fIn fact, the overall aspect of the J/\u03c8 \u03c0\u03c0 cross section appears to be rather constant (see below),\nwith no obvious sign of the established and possible new cc\u0304 resonances. So pion-pair creation\ndoes not seem to stem from the constituent cc\u0304 system. Nevertheless, besides a cc\u0304 component\nwe may assume the presence of glue [23, 24]. The latter field will, in the periphery, absorp little\nof the cc\u0304 oscillations and the corresponding resonances. Hence, anything created out of the\nsurrounding glue will probably not display much of the charmonium structure and its spectrum.\nThus, we may suppose that the pion pair stems from the glue, not from the strongly oscillating\ninterior. This explains why a \u03c3-like \u03c0\u03c0 structure can be formed that is not correlated with any\ncc\u0304 resonances. Such a structure, being very broad, allows for a wide range of total two-pion\nmasses at a slowly varying rate, and so shows up as an almost constant signal for a comparably\nwide range of total J/\u03c8\u03c0\u03c0 invariant masses. The peripheral, OZI-forbidden \u03c0\u03c0-creation process\nis depicted in Fig. 1.\n\u03c0\u2212\n\ne\u2212\n\u03b3\n\n\u03c0+\nJ/\u03c8\n\ncc\u0304\ne+\nFigure 1: Peripheral creation of pion pairs in the gluon cloud surrounding cc\u0304, for the reaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192\n\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8.\n\nHowever, at the opening of an open-charm decay channel, the dynamics of the system is dominated by string breaking through the creation of light quark-antiquark pairs. We have shown in\nRef. [4] that such a process is substantially faster than peripheral pion-pair production. Hence,\nit eats away signal by premature decay into open-charm hadrons, thus leaving dips in the production cross section for J/\u03c8 \u03c0\u03c0. Nonetheless, this is not the case at the X(4260) enhancement,\nwhich certainly calls for an explanation.\nIn Ref. [4], we found that, except for the dips and the X(4260) signal, the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8\ncross section is rather flat. This leaves us with the picture that the cc\u0304 propagator, which is formed\nin e+ e\u2212 annihilation, allows for the development of a pion pair as long as it is not resonating\nor near the opening of a threshold. Moreover, as the cc\u0304 propagator dominantly couples to\nvector-vector (VV) open-charm pairs, four times more weakly to pseudoscalar-vector (PV), and\nseven times more weakly to pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar (PP), it has to be expected that special\nphenomena may be observed at or just above the threshold of a VV open-charm pair. As we\nhave argued above, open channels get damped quite fast at higher energies.\nThere are two candidates for VV open-charm channels, viz. D \u2217 D \u2217 and Ds\u2217 Ds\u2217 . Now, D \u2217 D \u2217\ndecay results from the creation of u\u016b and dd \u0304 pairs, which, being a much faster process than\nperipheral pion-pair creation, eats away signal from e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8. So this might leave a\ndip in the cross section of this process [4]. We shall come back to this issue further on.\nWe now assume for the reaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 the following scenario. When not near a\nresonance or an open-charm threshold, the pion pair is basically formed [25] in the gluon cloud,\nwith the quantum numbers of the \u03c3. However, near the cc\u0304 \u2192 Ds\u2217 Ds\u2217 threshold, the dynamics\nof the system is dominated by ss\u0304 pair creation, which we reckon to be a much faster process\nthan peripheral pion-pair creation. Consequently, we should expect a dip in the cross section. In\norder to explain the X(4260) peak, we must assume that ss\u0304 pair creation, besides allowing for\nthe formation of the pair of Ds\u2217 mesons, makes a process possible other than the creation of a\n3\n\n\fpion pair from up and down quarks. Such a process exists, namely the formation of f0 (980) [26],\nwhich then couples to a pion pair, though not very strongly [27].\nThis may explain why the J/\u03c8\u03c0\u03c0 signal closely follows the rise and fall of the Ds\u2217 D\u0304s\u2217 amplitude\non top of the constant \"background\" of J/\u03c8\u03c0\u03c0, which stems from the processes originating in\nthe surrounding glue.\n\nX-sect(events/20 MeV/c2 )\n\nDs\u2217 Ds\u2217\n\n80\n\n\u2022\n\n60\n\u2022\n40\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n20\n\nJ/\u03c8f0(980)\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nJ/\u03c8f0 (600)\n4.20\n\n4.25\n4.30\n4.35\nm\u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 J/\u03c8(GeV)\n\n4.40\n\nFigure 2: Schematic representation of the distinct contributions to the total cross section for e+ e\u2212\nannihilation into J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . The vertical gray bar shows the region where the Ds\u2217 Ds\u2217 threshold may be\nsituated, according to the various results for the Ds\u2217 mass, reported in Refs. [28\u201333]. The data are taken\nfrom Ref. [1].\n\nIn Fig. 2 we depict each of the three contributions: the almost constant peripheral production\nof pion pairs via sigmas, the dip which is caused by premature decay into Ds\u2217 pairs, and the\ncontribution to pion-pair production by f0 (980)s which stem from the abundantly produced ss\u0304\npairs. \u00bfFrom Fig. 2 we may also infer that each of the two distinct processes occurs for roughly\n50%. Experiment [1, 3, 6] seems to agree with this value, but for a definite conclusion we must\nawait better statistics.\nWe thus have two processes of very different origin, which result in the same final state. Such\na situation may give rise to interference effects in the J/\u03c8 \u03c0\u03c0 production amplitude, and hence\nto observable oscillations, which indeed appear to be present in the data shown in Fig. 2. One\nmode is the relatively slow, OZI-forbidden process via the peripheral formation of up and down\nquarks, while the other mode is J/\u03c8 \u03c0\u03c0 production through the formation of f0 (980)s in an ss\u0304rich environment. Moreover, for the latter process we have an idea of the frequency of the cc\u0304\noscillations, namely \u03c9 \u223c 200 MeV [34, 35], which is equivalent to an oscillation period of T \u2248 5\nGeV\u22121 .\nIn the foregoing, we have taken the mass of the Ds\u2217 Ds\u2217 threshold as a very rigorous boundary\nfor the onset of the X(4260) signal. This is, of course, correct for the onset of the dip. However,\nfor f0 (980) formation we are not bound by the Ds\u2217 Ds\u2217 threshold, since ss\u0304 creation will certainly\nbe important already close to but below threshold, also because of the 40\u2013100 MeV width [2] of\nthe f0 (980). The BABAR data indeed start to rise already some 40\u201350 MeV below threshold.\nFurthermore, the J/\u03c8f0 system couples in an S-wave to the cc\u0304 vector propagator. Hence, the\nbehavior will be different from the P -wave shape of Eq. (1).\n4\n\n\fAt present, it is not possible to model such a highly complex system, since moreover the cc\u0304\nresonances will play an important role [36], too. Hence, in order to account for interference, we\nsimply modify the S-wave equivalent of the distribution in Eq. 1 with an interference term:\nh\n\nmain signal + 1 + \u03b1 cos\n\n\u0010n\n\no\n\nm\u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 J/\u03c8 \u2212 2mDs\u2217 \u2206T\n\n\u0011i\n\n2\ne\u2212 |pr0 | ,\n\n(2)\n\nwith 4p2 = m2\u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 J/\u03c8 \u2212 4m2Ds\u2217 . The main signal has been explained in Ref. [4]. It consists of a\nconstant term and a very wide bell-shaped contribution, which for the new BABAR data has\nits maximum at 4.35 GeV, and a width of 750 MeV. Here, we choose the constant contribution\nsomewhat smaller than in Ref. [4], in an attempt to average over the maxima and minima in the\nsignal.\nIn Fig. 3a, we show the resulting amplitude over a wide energy range, using r0 = 2.5 GeV\u22121\nabove threshold, r0 = 4.2 GeV\u22121 below, and for the moment \u03b1 = 0. On the other hand, in\nFig. 3b we depict the amplitude in the energy interval of 4.1\u20134.4 GeV, but now for \u03b1 = 0.4\nand \u2206T = 85 GeV\u22121 , and the same values for r0 .

In (a), where no interference\nis considered, we observe the Ds\u2217 Ds\u2217 threshold cusp in J/\u03c8 \u03c0\u03c0. In (b) an additional interference effect\nis introduced as given by Eq. (2), with \u03b1 = 0.4 and \u2206T = 85 GeV\u22121 . The vertical gray lines represent\nthe various open-charm thresholds.\n\nthe expected Ds\u2217 Ds\u2217 threshold cusp [37] in the cross section for e+ e\u2212 annihilation into J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 .\nAlso the interference pattern peaks at threshold and agrees to a reasonable degree with the\ndata. Consequently, the BABAR data seem to confirm our picture for the X(4260) signal as\nconsisting of two processes, each with its own characteristic frequency. Furthermore, we find\nfrom expression (2) that peripheral pion-pair creation oscillates with a period of about 85 GeV\u22121 ,\nwhich is 17 times slower than pion-pair production via ss\u0304. This looks like a reasonable factor for\nthe suppression of OZI-forbidden hadronic decays relative to OZI-allowed ones. Also note that,\nexcept at the opening of the cc\u0304 \u2192 Ds\u2217 Ds\u2217 channel, there is no specific peak position associated\nwith either of the two phenomena. Hence, in this scenario the X(4260) enhancement does not\nrepresent a new kind of resonance.\nLet us now further discuss the D \u2217 D \u2217 channel. In this case, the relevant pair creations from\n \u0304 which then couple to the \u03c3. Consequently, the situation is\nstring breaking are u\u016b and dd,\ncomparable to the X(4260) signal. In fact, the Belle Collaboration did observe a similar structure\n5\n\n\f[6], just above the D \u2217 D \u2217 threshold, but not confirmed by the BABAR Collaboration [1]. However,\nthere is an important difference between the mass of the latter signal and of the X(4260). Namely,\nthe X(4260) comes right in between the two cc\u0304 vector states \u03c8(4160) and \u03c8(4415). So the\namplitude for open-charm production is close to a minimum here, which is favorable for the\nobservation of other phenomena, as explained above. On the other hand, the Belle signal at 4050\nMeV comes almost on top of the \u03c8(4040), and so may be subject to destructive interference.\nNonetheless, this might be settled with better statistics in the future.\nIn Ref. [4], we showed that the cross section for e+ e\u2212 annihilation into J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 consists of\na constant signal plus and a very wide bell-shaped structure, which has its maximum at about\n4.35 GeV. The latter extremely broad structure is supported by a very recent detailed three-body\ncalculation for J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [38], to be published soon. In the foregoing, we have shown that in the\n4.26 GeV region there additionally appears to be an interference structure. We believe a 10 MeV\nbinning of the data could shed some more light on the picture for the X(4260) enhancement\nproposed here.\nThe fundamental implications of the here observed interference effects between equal final\nstates but with different creation mechanisms are not yet clear to us. Nevertheless, similar\neffects might be observable for the X(4140) enhancement in J/\u03c8 \u03c6 [39].\nWe are grateful for the rather precise measurements of the BABAR Collaboration, which\nallowed for the present analysis.
