Instead, the desired state is heralded by a\nmacroscopic quantum jump. Macroscopic quantum jumps manifest themselves as a random telegraph signal with long intervals of intense fluorescence (light periods) interrupted by the complete\nabsence of photons (dark periods).

Consequently much effort has been made over\nthe last few years to generate highly entangled states\nin the laboratory. For example, groups in Boulder and\nInnsbruck have entangled up to eight ions [3] and a\nfour-photon cluster state has been created by Walther\net al. [4]. However, scaling these setups to many more\nqubits is not straightforward. Adding qubits in ion traps\nincreases the density of motional states and therefore\nrequires some form of distributed quantum computing,\npossibly involving ion transport [5]. The main difficulties when entangling photons are the lack of an effective\ninteraction and reliable photon storage.\nAlthough not yet demonstrated experimentally, a\npromising alternative is to entangle atoms by coupling\nthem via an optical cavity. The ability to position the\natoms inside such a resonator to within a fraction of the\noptical wavelength [6] together with the possibility of effectively coupling distant cavities via optical networks\n[7, 8] promises a high degree of control and scalability. The quality of atom-cavity setups is often measured\nby the single-atom cooperativity parameter C \u2261 g 2 /\u03ba\u0393,\nwhich compares the atom-cavity coupling constant g with\nthe cavity photon decay rate \u03ba [9] and the atom decay\nrate \u0393. After several years of experimentation with optical cavities values of C of about 50 have been reported\nin the literature [10]. Significantly larger C's are currently only possible when using AlGaAs resonators with\nembedded quantum dots [11].\nDespite recent progress, the achievable values of C are\nstill too low to allow for the high fidelity generation of\nhighly entangled atomic states with existing proposals.\nEven when using dissipation-assisted stimulated Raman\nadiabatic passages (STIRAP) [12], strong detunings [13],\nor the idea of quantum computing using dissipation [14],\na precision of more than 0.85 requires C > 100. An exception is the scheme by Pachos and Walther [15] which\n\nFIG. 1: Macroscopic quantum jumps in the fluorescence of\ntwo atoms trapped inside an optical cavity (c.f. Figure 2)\nobtained from the numerical simulation of a possible trajectory assuming \u2206 = 50 g, \u03930 = \u03931 , \u03ba = \u03a9L = g and\n\u0393 = \u03a9M = 0.1 g, i.e. C = 10. Shown is the number of photon\nemissions within time intervals of length \u2206t = 0.38 Tdark as a\nfunction of time.\n\nachieves better results at the cost of a very slow and\ncomplex entangling STIRAP process. Even probabilistic\nschemes based on the detection of single photons promise\nfidelities above 0.9 only with perfect single photon detectors or require C \u226b 1 [16]. In contrast, we show here\nthat it is possible to prepare two atoms in the maximally\n\u221a\nentangled ground state |a01 i \u2261 (|01i \u2212 |10i)/ 2 with a\nfidelity F above 0.9 even if C is as low as 10 and when using a photon detector with an efficiency as low as \u03b7 = 0.2.\nHigher fidelities require a larger value of C or \u03b7.\nAchieving this is only possible, when dissipation plays\na major role in the state preparation process. In the\nfollowing we achieve this by employing a quantum mechanical phenomena known as quantum jumps. These\nabrupt transitions of the internal states of an atom, upon\nthe emission or absorption of a light quantum, were proposed by Bohr as early as 1913 [17]. Bohr's quantum\njumps were disturbing to many prominent physicists, including Schr\u00f6dinger, as they raised many questions about\nour understanding of quantum mechanics [18]. However,\nit became possible to observe these jumps experimentally\nin the form of macroscopic light and dark periods, like\nthe ones shown in Figure 1. In 1986, several group reported the blinking of the fluorescence of a single laser\ndriven trapped ion [19].\nIn the language of modern quantum theory, macroscopic quantum jumps are a random telegraph process\n\n\f2\n0\u20132 transition of each atom couples to the cavity field\nwith coupling strength g, while laser fields with Rabi frequency \u03a9M and \u03a9L drive the 0\u20131 and the 1\u20132 transitions,\nrespectively. Here we are interested in the parameter\nregime where [23]\nFIG. 2: (a) Experimental setup for the preparation of a maximally entangled state of two atoms trapped inside an optical\ncavity. (b) Level configuration of one atom with the qubit\nstates |0i and |1i.\n\nwith long intervals of intense photon emissions interrupted by periods of the complete absence of photons.\nThey occur in the fluorescence of a single ion, if rapidly\nrepeated measurements project the system either in a\nsubspace of states, in which the systems emits photons\nat a high rate, or in a state, where it cannot undergo\nspontaneous emissions [20]. Dehmelt, who predicted the\nexistence of macroscopic quantum jumps in 1975, rightly\nrelated this effect to electron shelving [21]. Small deviations from ideal measurements can cause a sudden change\nof the respective measurement outcome and are thereby\nresponsible for transitions (jumps) from a light into a\ndark period and vice versa [22].\nIn the following, we generalise the setup introduced by\nDehmelt and propose a scheme to entangle the electronic\nground states of two atoms trapped inside an optical resonator. Interactions are applied such that the combined\natom-cavity system generates macroscopic light and dark\nperiods. Moreover, the desired state is the only dark state\nsuch that the absence of fluorescence indicates the shelving of the system with a high precision into the desired\nstate. Turning off the applied laser fields within a dark\nperiod stops the system from returning into yet another\nlight period and is enough to complete the state preparation.\nThe concrete experimental setup and the required\natomic level diagram are shown in Figure 2. The trapping of the particles and the directions of the incoming\nlaser fields should be chosen such that both atoms experience the same coupling constants. More concretely, the\n\nHcond =\n\n\u03a9M < g, \u03ba, \u0393, \u03a9L \u226a \u2206 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwith the detuning \u2206 as shown in Figure 2 and where\n\u0393 denotes the spontaneous decay rate of level 2. \u03a9M\ncan be realised using a microwave, a two-photon Raman\ntransition via level 2 or a fourth level, since selection rules\nforbid the direct excitation of the 0\u20131 transition.\nIn the following we model the atom-cavity system\nshown in Figure 2 by the master equation\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u2020\n+ R(\u03c1) .\n(2)\n\u03c1\u0307 = \u2212 ~i Hcond \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1Hcond\nHere R is the reset operator describing the change of the\nsystem in the event of an emission and Hcond is the conditional Hamiltonian relating to the no-photon evolution\n[22].

Doing so and denoting the number of cavity photons by n, while \u03b1jk,n , \u03c3jk,n and \u03bejj,n are the\namplitudes of the states |ajk , ni, |sjk , ni and |jj, ni, respectively, we find that\n\u03b102,0 = \u2212(\u03a9L /2\u2206) \u03b101,0 , \u03b112,0 = \u03be22,0 = 0 ,\n\u221a\n\u03c302,0 = \u2212(\u03a9L /2\u2206) \u03c301,0 , \u03c312,0 = (\u03a9L / 2\u2206) \u03be11,0 ,\n\n\u03be00,1 = \u2212(2igeff /\u03ba) \u03c301,0 , \u03c301,1 = \u2212(2igeff /\u03ba) \u03be11,0 (8)\n\nup to first order in 1/\u2206. Effectively the system can be\ndescribed by\n\u0002\n\u0003\nHcond = \u221a12 ~\u03a9M |00, 0ihs01 , 0| + |s01 , 0ih11, 0| + H.c.\n\u0002\n\u0003\n+~\u2206L |11, 0ih11, 0| \u2212 |00, 0ih00, 0|\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2212 2i ~ \u03baeff |s01 , 0ihs01 , 0| + |11, 0ih11, 0| ,\n\u0002\n\u0003\nR(\u03c1) = \u03baeff |00, 0ihs01 , 0| + |s01 , 0ih11, 0| ,\n(9)\n\u0001\n2\nwith \u2206L \u2261 \u2212\u03a92L / 4\u2206 and \u03baeff \u2261 4geff\n/\u03ba.\nThe dark state of a system is the state with a negligible spontaneous decay rate. Furthermore, the system's\nevolution should not be able to transfer this state into\none that can cause an emission. From Eqs. (9), we see\nthat this applies only to the zero eigenstate |a01 , 0i of\nHcond . From the above calculations we also see that a\nlight period mainly involves the states |00, 0i, |s01 , 0i and\n|11, 0i. An interaction drives these states with frequency\n\u03a9M and detuning \u2206L continuously, as shown in Figure\n3. Population in |s01 , 0i and |11, 0i can cause a photon\nto leak out through the cavity mirrors with the effective\nrate \u03baeff . After a certain time, these processes result in\na stationary state. Using Eq. (9) and setting \u03c1\u0307 = 0 we\nfind the steady state populations\nP00,0 = 1 \u2212 Ps01 ,0 \u2212 P11,0 ,\n\nPs01 ,0 = (1 + 8x2 )/(3 + 16x2 + 16x4 ) ,\nP11,0 = 1/(3 + 16x2 + 16x4 )\n\n(10)\n\n\u03ba\u22062\n4g 2 \u03a92L\n\n(11)\n\nfor the mean time between two cavity photon emissions,\nsince Tcav = 1/\u03bahni.\nTransitions between light and dark periods occur since\npopulation in the states |s01 , 0i, |11, 0i and |a01 , 0i results\nin small amounts of population in |s02 , 0i, |s12 , 0i, and\n|a02 , 0i, respectively (c.f. Eq. (8)). This eventually leads\nto an atomic decay from level 2 which prepares the setup\nin a superposition of a light and the dark state. Now\nthere are three possibilities: (i) After a short time the\nsystem emits another photon via an atomic decay and\nreturns into a neither symmetric nor antisymmetric state,\nwhich brings us back to the initial situation. (ii) No\nphoton is emitted for a time, which is long compared to\nTcav , preparing the atoms in |a01 i. (iii) A photon leaks\nout through the cavity mirrors and prepares the setup in\na symmetric state (c.f. Eq. (9)) with no population in the\ndark state. In the latter two cases a transition between a\nlight and a dark period may have occurred. The reason\nfor the projection into one of the subspaces is that the\nobservation of cavity leakage reveals information about\nthe system. This measurement projects the atoms either\ninto a symmetric state or into |a01 i.\nMore concretely, the end of a dark period is caused\nby a spontaneous emission from the state |a02 , 0i. Its\npopulation within a dark period can be calculated using\nEq. (8) with \u03b101,0 = 1. Moreover we see from Eq. (7)\nthat such an emission transfers the atoms with rate \u03930\ninto the state |00i and with rate 12 \u03931 into |s01 i. Both\ntogether imply\nTdark =\n\n1\n8\u22062\n* 2 .\n2\u03930 + \u03931 \u03a9L\n\n(12)\n\nSimilarly, taking Eqs. (8) and (10) into account, we see\nthat a light period ends at any time with the probability\ndensity 12 \u03930 Ps02 ,0 + 21 \u03931 Ps12 ,0 which yields\nTlight =\n\n3 + 16x2 + 16x4 8\u22062\n*\n2\u03930 + (1 + 8x2 )\u03931 \u03a92L\n\n(13)\n\nfor the mean length of a light period.\nCrucial for the ability to distinguish a light from a dark\nperiod is that Tdark is sufficiently longer than Tcav . For\na wide range of parameters, namely for \u03a94L \u226a (4\u2206\u03a9M )2 ,\none has x2 \u226a 1 and the ratio Tdark /Tcav is to a very good\napproximation given by its maximum 32g 2 /3\u03ba(2\u03930 + \u03931 ).\nTherefore, the obtainable telegraph signal (c.f. Figure 1)\nbecomes clearer the larger the single atom cooperativity\nparameter C. However, the proposed state preparation\n\n\f4\na high fidelity even when using realistic photon detectors and a relatively modest atom-cavity setup. Because\nof their reliability, we believe that macroscopic quantum\njumps will become a very useful tool for the controlled\ngeneration of entanglement in physical systems.\n\nFIG. 4: The deviation from unity of the fidelity F of the\nstate prepared after the detection of no photon for a time t for\ndifferent detector efficiencies \u03b7 and for the same parameters\nas in Figure 1 (C = 10) obtained from a numerical simulation.\n\nscheme, namely turning off the laser fields upon the detection of no photon for a time t of the order of Tdark , also\nworks for relatively small values of C. For C = 10 a dark\nperiod is on average 70 times longer than Tcav and the entangled state |a01 i can be obtained with a fidelity above\n0.9 for t > 0.7 Tdark even when using a photon detector\nwith an efficiency of \u03b7 = 0.2 (c.f. Figure 4). Fidelities\nabove 0.95 require \u03b7 \u2265 0.5 and t > 0.4 Tdark. Generally\nit does not take long to find the system in a dark period,\nsince Tlight is on average only about three times longer\nthan Tdark .\nIn summary, we have described a scheme that can be\nused to entangle two atoms trapped inside an optical cavity. The generalisation of our scheme to a wider class\nof entangled states, including cluster states for one-way\nquantum computing [2], is straightforward. This can be\nachieved by placing more than two atoms simultaneously\ninto the cavity and by moving them subsequently in and\nout of the resonator [24]. Problems might arise from having to trap the atoms at fixed positions with respect to\nthe cavity mode and the incoming laser fields. However,\nthe techniques for doing this have improved significantly\nover recent years [6]. In addition, the cavity can be used\nto cool the atomic motion between different attempts to\nentangle the atoms, as recently demonstrated by Nussmann et al. [25].\nCharacteristic for the proposed scheme is its constructive use of dissipation. Indeed it is well known that dissipation causes irreversibility and reduces the entropy of\ncoupled quantum systems. Applications are the cooling\nof single atoms to very low temperatures [26], the fusion of Bose Einstein condensates [27] and measurementbased quantum computing schemes [2, 8, 14, 15]. Moreover, the presence of spontaneous decay rates can be used\nto stabilise the time evolution of a system [12]. In contrast to this, the present paper describes a dissipative\nprocess, which transfers the system into a macroscopic\ndark period. The successful state preparation is heralded\nby the interruption of a long interval of intense fluorescence. It is therefore possible to entangle atoms with\n\nAcknowledgment. We thank E. Hinds, P.
