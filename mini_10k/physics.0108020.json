In conventional lasers DFB is formed in such a way that diffracted\nand transmitted waves propagate along a line in opposite directions. The distinctive feature of volume free electron lasers (VFEL) is using of non-onedimensional (volume) distributed feedback at which the diffracted wave propagates at the angle 6= \u03c0 to the transmitted wave. Firstly the idea to use volume distributed feedback (VDFB) for X-ray generation was proposed in [3].\nVDFB causes sharp increase of amplification and instability increment of electron beam density is proportional to \u223c \u03c11/(3+s) , where \u03c1 is the electron beam\ndensity and s is the number of surplus waves appearing due to diffraction (for\nexample, in case of two-wave Bragg diffraction s = 1, for three-wave diffraction s = 2 and so on). This dependence essentially differs from increment for\nconventional FEL in Compton regime, which is proportional to \u223c \u03c11/3 [4].\nNow the investigation of 4-wave diffraction in system with two-dimentional\nDFB is also started by [5].\nSharp increase of amplification caused by VDFB yields to noticeable reduction of threshold currents necessary for lasing start. This fact is particuPreprint submitted to Elsevier Preprint\n\n13 November 2018\n\n\flarly important for lasing in submillimetre and visible ranges and for shorter\nwavelengths. Explicit expressions VFEL threshold currents were obtained in\n[7]. In present work the dependence of VFEL starting current on undulator\nparameters is considered.\n\n2\n\nGeneration and amplification laws of undulator VFEL\n\nIt is well known that to find amplification and starting current one should\nstudy the dispersion law of radiating system The set of equations describing\ninteraction of relativistic electron beam, which propagates in spatially periodic\nstructure in undulator is [7]:\nDE \u2212 \u03c9 2 \u03c71 E1 \u2212 \u03c9 2\u03c72 E2 \u2212 ... = 0\n\u2212\u03c9 2 \u03c7\u22121 E + D1 E1 \u2212 \u03c9 2\u03c72\u22121 E2 \u2212 ... = 0\n\u2212\u03c9 2 \u03c7\u22122 E \u2212 \u03c9 2\u03c71\u22122 E1 + D2 E2 = 0 \u2212 ...,\n...\n\n(1)\n\nwhere D\u03b1 = k\u03b12 c2 \u2212 \u03c9 2\u03b5 + \u03c7\u03b1(b) , ~k\u03b1 = ~k + ~\u03c4\u03b1 are the wave vectors of photons\ndiffracted by the crystal planes with corresponding reciprocal vectors ~\u03c4\u03b1 , \u03b50 =\n1 + \u03c70 , \u03c7\u03b1 are the dielectric constants of a periodic structure. These constants\ncan be obtained from the following representation of dielectric permiability of\nperiodic structure:\n\u03b5(~r, \u03c9) = 1 +\n\nX\n\nexp(i~\u03c4 ~r)\u03c7\u03c4 (\u03c9).\n\n{\u03c4 }\n\n\u03c7(b)\n\u03b1 is the part of dielectric susceptibility appearing from the interaction of an\nelectron beam, propagating in undulator, with radiation:\n\u03c0\u03982s c2\nj0\n2\n\u03b3z \u03b3IA (\u03c9 \u2212 (k + kw )uw )2\nf or the \"cold\" beam limit and\n\u221a \u03c0\u03982s c2 j0 t\n\u03c0 2\n\u03c7(b)\n=\n\u2212i\nx exp[\u2212(xt\u03b1 )2 ]\n\u03b1\n\u03b3z \u03b3IA \u03c3\u03b12 \u03b1\nf or the \"hot\" beam limit,\n\u03c7(b)\n\u03b1 =\n\n(2)\n\n\u0398s = eHw /(mc2 \u03b3kw ), \u03b3z\u22122 = \u03b3 \u22122 +\u03982s , kw = 2\u03c0/\u03bb\nperiod,Hw\n\u221a w , \u03bbw is undulator\n2\n2\n\u03a821 + k\u03b12\n\u03a822 +\nis undulator field, xt\u03b1 = (\u03c9 \u2212 (k + kw )uw )/ 2\u03c3\u03b1 , \u03c3\u03b12 = (k\u03b11\n2\n~ = \u2206~u/u is the velocity spread. If the inequality xt \u226b 1 is\nk\u03b13\n\u03a823 )u2 and \u03a8\n\u03b1\nfulfilled, all the electrons interact with electromagnetic wave and the \"cold\"\n2\n\n\flimit is realized. In the opposite case (\"hot\" limit) xt\u03b1 < 1 only small part of\nelectron beam interacts with electromagnetic wave. Setting the determinant\nof linear system (1) equal to zero one can obtain the dispersion equation for\nthe system \"electromagnetic wave + undulator + electron beam + periodic\nstructure\". In case of two-wave dynamical diffraction this equation has the\nfollowing form:\nDD1 \u2212 \u03c9 4 \u03c71 \u03c7\u22121 = 0\n\n(3)\n\nFor the system with finite interaction length the solution of boundary problem\ncan be presented as a sum:\n\nE + E1 =\n\nX\n\n(i)\n\nci exp{iki r}(e + e1 s1 exp{i\u03c4 r}),\n\n(4)\n\ni\n\n(i)\n\nhere s1 =\n\nki2 c2 \u2212\u03c9 2 \u03b50\n\u03c9 2 \u03c71\n\nare the coupling coefficients between the diffracted and\ntransmitted waves (E (1) = s1 E) and ~ki are the solutions of dispersion equation\n(3). To determine coefficients ci it is necessary to write the boundary conditions\non the system ends z = 0 and z = L. For Bragg geometry, when transmitted\nand diffracted waves has the opposite signs of wave vector projections on the\naxis z, these conditions are as follows:\n\nX\ni\n\nci = a\n\nX\ni\n\nci\n=0\n\u03b4i\n\nX\ni\n\nci\n=0\n\u03b4i2\n\nX\n\n(i)\n\ns1 ci exp{ikiz L} = b\n\n(5)\n\ni\n\nIn (5) the wave vector is represented as: k = k0 + \u03c9c \u03b4, where k0 satisfies\nundulator synchronism condition. The boundary conditions (5) are written\nfor the \"cold\" electron beam. In this case the dispersion equation has four\nroots (\u03b4i , i = 1 \u00f7 4). The first and the fourth conditions in (5) correspond\nto continuity of transmitted wave at z = 0 and diffracted wave at boundary\nz = L (it is supposed that the wave with wave vector ~k and amplitude a is\nfalling on boundary z = 0 and the wave with wave vector ~k1 and amplitude b is\nfalling on boundary z = L). The second and the third conditions in (5) accord\nwith the requirement that the electron beam is unpertubed before entering the\ninteraction region. The part of electron beam energy converting to radiation\ncan be expressed as:\nI \u223c \u03b30 |E(z = L)|2 + |\u03b31||E1 (z = 0)|2 =\n\u0013\n\u0012\n16\u03c0 2 n2\n\u03b30 c 3\n2\n2\n,\n(\u03b30 |a| + |\u03b31 ||b| )\n~n~u \u2212\u03b2(k|\u03c71 |L\u2217 )2 kL\u2217 (\u0393start \u2212 \u0393)\nwhere L is the length of interaction in undulator,\n3\n\n(6)\n\n\f\u0393start\n\n\u221a !\n16\u03c0 2 n2\nr\" \u2212\u03b2\n\u2212 \u03c7\" 1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u00b1\n\u2212\u03b2(k|\u03c71 |L\u2217 )2\n|\u03c71 |\u03c7\"\n2 2\n2 2\n\u03c0 n \u03c0\u0398s c j0 2 2 2\nk L\u2217 q f (y),\n\u0393=\n4 \u03b3z2 \u03b3IA \u03c9 2\n(2y + \u03c0n) sin y \u2212 y(y + \u03c0n) cos y\nf (y) = sin y\ny 3(y + \u03c0n)3\n\n\u03b30 c\n=\n~n~u\n\u0012\n\n\u00133\n\nis the function of generation dependence on detuning from synhronism condition, y = (\u03c9 \u2212 kvw \u2212 \u03a9)L/(2uz ) is detuning factor, \u03b2 = \u03b30 /\u03b31 is diffraction\nasymmetry factor, \u03b30 , \u03b31 are diffraction cosines, \u03c7\" = Im \u03c70 .

Dependence of induced radiation on detuning factor y in the condition of\ntwo-wave diffraction.\n\nfactor y is not asymmetric. This distinguishes lasing in the range of roots degeneration from generation process in conventional undulator FEL. The latter\nhas the following dependence on detuning factor [4]:\ng(y) =\n\nsin y y cos y \u2212 sin y\n.\ny\ny2\n\nThis difference ensues from interference of contribution to radiation of two\ndiffraction roots. From (6) follows that: 1. the starting current in case of twowave diffraction is proportional to jstart \u223c (kL)\u22121 (k\u03c71 L)\u22122 ;\n2. non-one dimensional VDFB provides the possibility to decrease the starting\ncurrent of generation by varying of the angles between the waves. The dependence of \u0393start (\u03b2)/\u0393start (\u03b2 = 0) on asymmetry factor \u03b2 is presented in fig.2.\n4\n\n\f3. if electron beam current is less than starting value j < jstart then energy in\nelectromagnetic wave at the system entrance can be written in the form:\n\nFig. 2.

It should be noted that\nconsidered effects take place in wide spectral range for wavelengths from centimeters to X-ray ([3,6\u20139]) and influence of effect increases with the frequency\ngrowth.\n\n5\n\n\f3\n\nConclusion\n\nThe generation threshold in undulator VFEL in case of VDFB can be achived\nat lower electron beam current and shorter undullator length when special\nconditions of roots degeneration are fulfilled. Change of VDFB conditions by\nvarying the volume geometry parameters (for example, the angle between wave\nvectors) gives the possibility to increase Q-factor and decrease starting current\n(see fig. 2) and, hence, the efficiency of generation can be increased.\n\nReferences\n[1] H.Kogelnik, C.Shank, Appl.Phys. 43, 2327 (1972).\n[2] A.Yariv, Optical Waves in Crystals (Wiley, 1984).\n[3] V.G.Baryshevsky, I.D.Feranchuk, Phys.Lett. 102A, 141 (1984).\n[4] T.C.Marshall, Free Electron Lasers (Macmillan Publishing Company, 1985).\n[5] Ginzburg N.S., Peskov N.Yu., Sergeev A.S., Opt.
