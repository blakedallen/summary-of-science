Of course, the generalization of the classical concepts to the noncommutative world can often be done in more than one way,\nand for noncommutative spaces there is evidence, e.g. stemming from the\nnotion of strong Morita equivalence [23], that \u2217-homomorphisms are not the\nright notion of continuous map, or at least not the only one, for commutative C*-algebras which are strongly Morita equivalent are always isomorphic,\nbut in general strong Morita equivalence is coarser than isomorphism. For\ninstance, a noncommutative C*-algebra may be strongly Morita equivalent\nto a commutative one, indicating that in spite of being noncommutative it\ncorresponds to a classical (i.e., commutative) space. See [8, Ch. II.2] for\nexamples.\nIn the present paper we will focus on another way of studying maps\nbetween noncommutative spaces, based on the observation that any Hausdorff space X can be recovered up to homeomorphism from its lattice of\nopen sets O(X). Concretely, X is homeomorphic to the space pt(O(X))\nwhose points are the maximal proper open sets, i.e., the sets of the form\nX \u2212 {x} for each point x \u2208 X, and whose opens are the sets of the form\nVU = {P \u2208 pt(O(X)) | U 6\u2286 P }, for each open set U \u2208 O(X). This is\nan instance of the general construction of a space from a locale (see e.g.\n[10]), and together with the well known fact that O(X) is order-isomorphic\nto the lattice I(C(X)) of closed ideals of C(X) this tells us that the spectrum of a unital commutative C*-algebra A can be obtained directly from\nits lattice of closed ideals I(A), and indeed the space pt(I(A)) is precisely the\nusual space of maximal ideals of A. Pursuing this line of thought, we can\nreformulate Gelfand duality in terms of an equivalence of categories between\nthe category of unital commutative C*-algebras and the category of compact regular locales (which is dually equivalent to the category of compact\n2\n\n\fHausdorff spaces - see [10] and references therein), or, if we wish to work\nin an arbitrary Grothendieck topos, an equivalence between the category\nof unital commutative C*-algebras and the category of compact completely\nregular locales [3, 4]. This suggests that in the noncommutative case such a\nlattice-theoretic approach may provide both an alternative notion of noncommutative space and an alternative notion of map between noncommutative\nspaces.\nIn the case of a noncommutative C*-algebra A, there are three immediate\ngeneralizations of the locale of closed ideals, namely the lattices I(A), R(A),\nand L(A), respectively of closed two-sided, right-sided, or left-sided ideals.\nOne of them, I(A), is in fact isomorphic to the lattice of open sets of the\nprimitive spectrum of A (the Jacobson topology), and therefore cannot capture that topological information in A which is of a noncommutative nature.\nConcerning the other two, it is irrelevant whether we consider right- or leftsided ideals from here on, and we will address only the right-sided ones. The\nlattice R(A) is in general not distributive, but the multiplication of closed\nright ideals obtained by taking the topological closure of the usual product\nof ideals,\nI&J = IJ = {a1 b1 + . . . + an bn | ai \u2208 I, bi \u2208 J} ,\nis distributive over joins:\nI&\n\n_\nj\n\nJj =\n\n_\n\n\u0012_ \u0013\n_\nIi &J =\nIi &J .\n\nI&Jj ,\n\nj\n\ni\n\ni\n\nBesides, in the commutative case we have I&J = I \u2229 J, so the multiplicative\nstructure of R(A) is a generalization of the meets of the locales of closed\nideals of the commutative case. In [12] it was in fact proposed that the\nresulting notion of quantale, consisting of a complete lattice Q equipped\nwith an associative multiplication & that satisfies the two distributivity laws\nabove, might provide a suitable algebraic framework within which to study\nthe spectrum of C*-algebras, without implying that such quantales should\nnecessarily be those of closed right ideals (although some papers seem to\nhave taken this point of view [7, 6, 5, 26, 25]). Indeed, in [5] it was shown\nthat any postliminal C*-algebra can be recovered from its quantale R(A),\nbut the same is not true for an arbitrary unital C*-algebra. In [13] Mulvey\nhas proposed that the spectrum of a unital C*-algebra A should be taken to\n3\n\n\fbe the quantale of all closed subspaces of A, which he called Max A, whose\nmultiplication is defined in an analogous way to that of R(A) (see \u00a72).\nVarious properties of the quantales Max A have meanwhile been studied [15, 14, 18], and the \"continuous maps\" between quantales are thought\nof as (the opposites of) quantale homomorphisms h : Q \u2192 Q\u2032 , i.e., functions\nwhich preserve joins and the multiplicative structure,\n\u0012_ \u0013 _\nh(a&b) = h(a)&h(b) ,\nh\nai =\nh(ai ) ,\ni\n\ni\n\nand satisfying other requirements (\"strength\" or \"unitality\") meant to force\nquantale homomorphisms between locales to be precisely the homomorphisms\nof locales (see \u00a72). This leads to some good candidates for categories of noncommutative spaces in the quantalic sense, and the main purpose of our\npresent paper is to address, albeit preliminarily, the way in which these categories relate to a \"standard\" category of noncommutative spaces, namely the\ncategory of unital C*-algebras, leaving matters such as Morita equivalence\nto future work.\nOur paper is based on three main ideas. First, motivated by the fact that\nin locale theory only some locales are spatial - i.e., isomorphic to topologies\nof actual spaces - we ask the question of whether the quantales of the form\nMax A are spatial. In particular, in \u00a73 we examine the notion of spatiality\nstudied in [20, 17, 11], based on a strong embedding into a product of certain\nsimple quantales. This notion provides an elegant generalization of the notion\nof spatiality for locales, but Max A is not usually spatial in this sense, as an\nexample due to Kruml [18] shows. In an attempt to remedy this situation, a\nnotion of \"spatialization\" is introduced and the \"spatial spectrum\" SpMax A\nis studied. Although its functorial properties are unsatisfactory, it evolves\nthat for commutative C*-algebras A, SpMax A and the localic spectrum of\nA, i.e. the locale of closed ideals, coincide.\nThis last fact suggests our second idea, which is to investigate the existence of a functor S from C*-algebras to quantales agreeing with the localic\nspectrum on commutative algebras. In the hope that S will be a potential equivalence of categories, producing an extension of Gelfand duality to\nnoncommutative C*-algebras, we also require that it preserve colimits, a necessary condition for a left adjoint. But, as we shall see in Theorem 4.5, such\na functor S just gives us the locale of closed ideals of the commutative reflection of A, which of course is completely uninteresting from the point of view\n4\n\n\fof noncommutative topology - for instance, S(A) is trivial for any simple\nC*-algebra (i.e., an algebra without proper closed two-sided ideals), which\nincludes all the algebras of matrices Mn (C) and various interesting examples\nthat arise in noncommutative geometry, such as the noncommutative space\nof Penrose tilings of the plane [8, Ch. II.3].\nIn [14] Mulvey and Pelletier formulated another notion of spatiality, based\non the notion of a discrete von Neumann quantale, motivated by work of\nGiles and Kummer [9] and Akemann [1], in which Max A is spatial for all\nC*-algebras A. It turns out that this notion is characterized by a right\nembedding (i.e. an embedding on right-sided elements) into a product of\ncertain simple quantales, which partly revives the role played by right-sided\nquantales in earlier papers by various authors [7, 6, 5, 26]. It follows that\nit is not the spectrum Max A itself that coincides with the localic spectrum\nwhen A is commutative, but rather its localic reflection, I(Max A), which\ncoincides. The difficulties met in \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 when trying to describe a\nspatial spectrum reinforce the idea that the revised notion of spatiality is\nnecessary - at least as far as studying C*-algebras is concerned, for other\napplications of quantales may lead to different notions of spatiality [21].\nOur acceptance of the spatiality of Max A leads us in \u00a75 to the third\npart of this paper, namely, to study the properties of the functor Max itself,\nand we attempt to describe the category of quantales that arises as image of\nthe functor Max. Although the immediate conclusion is that the categories\nare rather different, since in particular the functor Max does not have any\nadjoints, it is the case that Max is faithful. Furthermore, it is possible, using\nresults in [9, 15], to recover A from Max A for any unital C*-algebra A, i.e.,\nMax is a complete invariant of unital C*-algebras, and thus it seems to have\npromising properties.\n\n2\n\nBackground\n\nWe begin by recalling the definitions of quantale theory which have come\nto play an important role in analysis and that of the motivating example,\nMax A. By a sup-lattice we shall always mean a complete lattice, and by a\nsup-lattice homomorphism we mean a map f between two sup-lattices which\npreserves arbitrary joins (but not necessarily meets):\n\u0012_ \u0013 _\nf\nxi =\nf (xi ) .\ni\n\ni\n\n5\n\n\fDefinition 2.1 By a quantale Q is meant a sup-lattice together with an\nassociative product, &, satisfying\n\u0012_ \u0013\n_\na&\nbi = (a&bi )\ni\n\nand\n\ni\n\n\u0012_ \u0013\n_\nai &b = (ai &b)\ni\n\ni\n\nW\nfor all a, b, ai , bi \u2208 Q. We always denote the bottom element \u2205 of Q by 0.\nThe quantale Q is said to be unital provided that there exists an element\ne \u2208 Q for which\ne&a = a = a&e\nfor all a \u2208 Q. The top element of Q is denoted by 1, and a quantale whose\ntop satisfies 1&1 = 1 is strong. A quantale Q for which 0 = 1 is trivial .\nExample 2.2 Let S be a sup-lattice. Then the set Q(S) of all the sup-lattice\nendomorphisms\nW\nW of S is a unital quantale whose joins are calculated pointwise,\n( i fi )(x) = i fi (x), whose multiplication is composition, f &g = g \u25e6 f , and\nwhose unit is the identity map idS . Such a quantale Q(S) is an example of\na simple quantale in the sense of [17].\nDefinition 2.3 An element a \u2208 Q of a quantale Q is said to be right-sided\nif\na&1 \u2264 a\nfor all a \u2208 Q. Similarly, a \u2208 Q is said to be left-sided if\n1&a \u2264 a\nfor all a \u2208 Q, and two-sided if it is both right- and left-sided. The sets of\nright-, left-, and two-sided elements of Q are respectively denoted by R(Q),\nL(Q), and I(Q).\nWe remark that for a unital quantale Q an element a \u2208 Q is right-sided\nif and only if a = a&1, and thus R(Q) = Q&1. Similarly, L(Q) = 1&Q and\nI(Q) = 1&Q&1 if Q is unital.\n\n6\n\n\fDefinition 2.4 By an involutive quantale is meant a quantale Q together\nwith an involution, \u2217 , satisfying the conditions that\na\u2217\u2217 = a ,\n(a&b)\u2217 = b\u2217 &a\u2217 , and\n\u0012_ \u0013\u2217 _\nai =\na\u2217i\ni\n\ni\n\nfor all a, b, ai \u2208 Q.\nBy a Gelfand quantale is meant a quantale Q which is unital, involutive,\nand which satisfies the condition\na&a\u2217 &a = a\nfor each right-sided (equivalently, left-sided) element a \u2208 Q.\nMotivated by Mulvey's consideration of the closed right ideals R(A) of\na C*-algebra A as a quantale, Rosick\u00fd [26] introduced a new multiplication\nand resulting structure (called quantum frame) on R(A) in an attempt to\nfind a complete invariant of A. While the quantum frame R(A) failed to\nprovide such an invariant and failed too to be functorial in the general sense,\nthe importance of the new multiplication and of the role of the closed right\nideals in the representation of C*-algebras in turn led Mulvey [13] to propose\nthe quantale Max A, the lattice of all closed linear subspaces of A, as the\nspectrum of A. Specifically,\nDefinition 2.5 For a noncommutative C*-algebra A with identity, by the\nspectrum of A is meant the unital involutive quantale Max A of all closed\nlinear subspaces of A together with the product, &, defined by setting\nM&N = MN = {a1 b1 + . . . + an bn | ai \u2208 M, bi \u2208 N} ,\nto be the closure\nW of the product of linear subspaces for each M, N \u2208 Max A,\nand the join, , defined by taking\nX\n_\nMi\nMi =\ni\n\ni\n\nto be the closure of the sum of linear subspaces for each family Mi \u2208 Max A.\nThe involution is calculated pointwise, M \u2217 = {a\u2217 | a \u2208 M}, and the unit of\nMax A is given by the closed linear subspace generated by the identity of A.\n7\n\n\fWe note that Max A is actually a Gelfand quantale [13].\nDefinition 2.6 By a quantale homomorphism \u03c6 : Q \u2192 Q\u2032 is meant a suplattice homomorphism which also preserves the operation of product, &, of\nthe quantales. The map is unital provided that e\u2032 = \u03c6(e), where e and e\u2032 are\nthe respective units, pre-unital if e\u2032 \u2264 f (e),1 and strong if 1\u2032 = \u03c6(1), where\n1 and 1\u2032 are the respective top elements of Q and Q\u2032 . A homomorphism of\ninvolutive quantales is involutive if it preserves the involution.\nWe denote various categories of quantales as follows: Qu is the category\nof quantales and quantale homomorphisms; by adding a subscript \"e\", as in\nQue , we restrict to unital quantales and unital homomorphisms; by adding\na subscript \"1\", as in Qu1 , we restrict to strong quantales and strong homomorphisms; by adding a superscript \"\u2217\", as in Qu\u2217 , we restrict to involutive\nquantales and involutive homomorphisms. (For instance, Qu\u2217e is the category\nof unital involutive quantales with unital and involutive homomorphisms.)\nExample 2.7 The mapping A 7\u2192 Max A extends to a functor from the category C\u2217 of unital C \u2217 -algebras to the category Qu\u2217e (or to its full subcategory\nGelQu of Gelfand quantales) [15]: if f : A \u2192 B, then Max f : Max A \u2192\nMax B assigns to each M \u2208 A the closure of f [M] = {f (a) \u2208 B | a \u2208 M}.\nDefinition 2.8 Let Q be a quantale and S a sup-lattice. A representation\nof Q on S is a homomorphism r : Q \u2192 Q(S). This makes S a right module\nover Q in an obvious sense, and we write x * a for the action of a \u2208 Q on\nx \u2208 S, i.e., x * a = r(a)(x).\nThe representation r is said to be irreducible if the only principal ideals\nI \u2286 S which are invariant under the representation are {0S } and S itself;\nthat is, if the condition I * Q \u2286 I implies either I = {0S } or I = S.\nProposition 2.9\n1. A representation of Q on S is irreducible if and only\nif x * 1Q \u2264 x implies that x = 0S or x = 1S , for all x \u2208 S.\n2. Any strong representation is irreducible.\n3. In the case of unital quantales, a pre-unital representation is irreducible\nif and only if it is strong.\n1\n\nIn [15] the unital homomorphisms are what we are now calling pre-unital.\n\n8\n\n\fProof. 1. Obvious from the fact that the condition x * 1Q \u2264 x is equivalent\nto \u2193x * Q \u2286 \u2193x [since \u2193x * Q = \u2193(x * 1Q )], x = 0S is equivalent to \u2193x = {0S },\nand x = 1S is equivalent to \u2193x = S.\n2. Assume that a representation of a quantale Q on S is strong. In module\nnotation this means that x*1Q = 1S for all x 6= 0 in S. Now assume x*1Q \u2264 x\nfor some x \u2208 S. If x 6= 0 we must have x = 1S , and thus the representation\nis irreducible.\n3. Assume that a representation of a unital quantale Q on S is pre-unital\nand irreducible. We have x * 1Q * 1Q \u2264 x * 1Q , and thus x * 1Q is either 0 or\n1S , by irreducibility. But x * 1Q \u2265 x * eQ \u2265 x due to pre-unitality, and thus\nx * 1Q = 0 if and only if x = 0. Hence, x * 1Q = 1S for all x 6= 0.\nExample 2.10 Let A be a unital C*-algebra and \u03c0 : A \u2192 B(H) a representation of A on a Hilbert space H. Then [15] a representation \u03c0\u0303 of Max A\non L(H) can be obtained canonically by setting, for each closed subspace\nV \u2208 Max A and each closed subspace W \u2208 L(H),\n\u03c0\u0303(V )(W ) = h{\u03c0(a)(x) | a \u2208 V, x \u2208 W }i ,\nwhere hXi denotes the linear span of a subset X \u2286 H. If \u03c0 is irreducible\nthen so is \u03c0\u0303 [15]. We shall refer to such an irreducible representation as a\nHilbert point of Max A.\nTo conclude this section we recall that a locale is a sup-lattice L satisfying\nthe distributivity law\n_\n_\na \u2227 bi =\na \u2227 bi\ni\n\ni\n\nfor all a, bi \u2208 L, and that a locale homomorphism is a sup-lattice homomorphism f : L \u2192 L\u2032 that also preserves the top and the binary meets\n(equivalently, the finite meets):\nf (a \u2227 b) = f (a) \u2227 f (b) ,\nf (1) = 1\u2032 .\nHence, any locale is a unital involutive quantale whose multiplication is meet,\n\u2227, whose involution is trivial, a\u2217 = a, and whose unit is the top, 1. The\ncategory of locales and their homomorphisms is denoted by Loc (beware\nthat in [10] Loc stands for our Locop ).\n9\n\n\f3\n\nSpatialization\n\nIn this section we address the extent to which quantales Max A can be viewed\nas \"spaces\" in the sense of being strongly embedded into a product of certain simple quantales, a notion introduced in [20] for involutive quantales\nand further studied in [17, 11] for arbitrary quantales. Examples based on\nTheorem 3.3 will show that Max A is usually not spatial in this sense. Furthermore, we will see that attempts to make the spatialization construction\nfunctorial lead to undesirable consequences.\nA natural definition of spatial involutive quantale is the following, meant\nto generalize that of spatial locale:\nDefinition 3.1 Let Q be a quantale. We say that Q is spatial with respect\nto a family of homomorphisms (\"points\") {pi : Q \u2192 Qi }i if, for all a, b \u2208 Q,\na = b whenever pi (a) = pi (b) for all i.\nOf course, this notion of spatiality depends upon the class of points considered. In [20] a definition was given for an involutive quantale Q, taking\nas \"points\" the involutive irreducible representations p : Q \u2192 Q(S) on a\nsup-lattice S with a duality (i.e., a sup-lattice S equipped with an order 2\nantitone automorphism), where Q(S) is an involutive quantale due to the\nduality of S [16], and by involutive representation is meant a representation\nwhich is an involutive homomorphism. In other words, Q was said to be\nspatial if it could be strongly embedded into a product of simple involutive\nquantales of the form Q(S). In [15] the notion of \"point\" of a unital involutive quantale was further refined, although no notion of spatiality was offered\nin that article. The object of [15] was to ensure when Q is of the form Max A\nthat points would correspond precisely to irreducible representations of the\nC*-algebra A.\nA practical characterization of the notion of spatiality above was given\nin [11] by means of prime elements of a quantale, where the points of a\nquantale Q can be taken to be the irreducible representations p : Q \u2192 Q(S).\nThis characterization will be useful for us so we recall it here.\nDefinition 3.2 Let Q be a quantale. An element p \u2208 Q is prime if the\ncondition a&1&b \u2264 p implies a \u2264 p or b \u2264 p, for all a, b \u2208 Q.\nTheorem 3.3 (Kruml) Let Q be a quantale. Then Q is spatial (with respect to irreducible representations) if and only if each a \u2208 Q is a meet of\nprime elements of Q.\n10\n\n\fWith this characterization it is easy to see that a quantale of the form\nMax A is not necessarily spatial in the sense of Definition 3.1, even if we take\nthe points to be all the irreducible representations:\nExample 3.4 The \"one-point\" C*-algebra of 2 \u00d7 2 matrices A = M2 (C) has\na non-spatial spectrum. To see this let\nP = {(ab bc ) | a, b, c \u2208 C} ,\nR = {(a0 b0 ) | a, b \u2208 C} ,\nL = {(ab 00 ) | a, b \u2208 C} .\nWe obtain R&A&L = {(a0 00 ) | a \u2208 C)} \u2286 P but R, L 6\u2286 P . Hence, P is\nmaximal but not prime, and thus it cannot be obtained as a meet of primes,\nwhich means Max A is not spatial.\nIn order to understand better the (non-)spatiality of Max A, let us study\nthe case when A is commutative. First we define a notion of spatialization for\n(not necessarily commutative) quantales that is analogous to that of locales,\nalthough it turns out, as we shall see, not to possess the same good functorial\nproperties as in the locale case.\nDefinition 3.5 Let {pi }i be a family of points of a quantale Q. The spatialization of Q with respect to {pi }i is the quotient Q/\u223c, where a \u223c b if and\nonly if pi (a) = pi (b) for all i. We denote by SpatQ : Q \u2192 Q/\u223c the natural\nquotient homomorphism.\nTheorem 3.6 Let A be a commutative unital C*-algebra. Then the following\nquantales coincide:\n1. the spatialization of Max A with respect to the Hilbert points (cf. Example 2.10);\n2. the spatialization of Max A with respect to all the irreducible representations;\n3. the locale of closed ideals I(Max A) (i.e., the \"classical\" localic spectrum\nof A).\nMoreover, the natural map SpatMax A is given by a 7\u2192 1&a&1.\n11\n\n\fProof. We have a quotient Max A \u2192 I(Max A) that sends each a \u2208 Max A\nto 1&a&1 (the localic reflection of Max A). Since the points in 1 form a\nproper subclass of the points in 2, the quantale in 1 is a quotient of that in\n2, and it suffices to show that the quantale in 2 is a quotient of I(Max A).\nLet us represent A as the algebra of continuous functions C(X) on a\ncompact Hausdorff topological space X. Consider a prime element P in\nMax A and let u, v \u2208 X be arbitrary points of X. They have disjoint open\nneighborhoods, say U and V . Let IF = {f \u2208 C(X) | (\u2200x \u2208 F )(f (x) = 0)} be\nthe closed ideal corresponding to a closed set F . Then (X \u2212U)\u222a(X \u2212V ) = X\nimplies IX\u2212U IX\u2212V = {0} \u2286 P . Since P is prime, we have that IX\u2212U \u2286 P\nor IX\u2212V \u2286 P . Since the points u, v have been chosen arbitrarily, we deduce\nthat there is at most one point x0 which has no open neighborhood W such\nthat IX\u2212W \u2286 P . For the other elements x \u2208 X \u2212 {x0 } we have a system of\nopen sets Ux (not containing x0 ) such\nS that IX\u2212Ux \u2286 P for every x, hence P\ncontains the maximal ideal I{x0 } = x IX\u2212Ux .\nNow, I{x0 } is maximal not only as an ideal but also as a subspace of C(X),\nand thus P = I{x0 } because P is prime and thus P 6= C(X). In order to\nverify that I{x0 } is a maximal subspace assume that P contains a function f\nsuch that f (x0 ) 6= 0, and let g \u2208 C(X). Define a function h \u2208 C(X) by\nh(x) = g(x) \u2212\n\nf (x)\ng(x0 ) .\nf (x0 )\n\nThen h(x0 ) = 0, and thus h \u2208 P , whence g \u2208 P because P is a linear space\nand g is the linear combination h + \u03bbf , with \u03bb = g(x0 )/f (x0 ). Since g is an\narbitrary function in C(X) it follows that P = C(X).\nWe conclude that every prime element of Max A is two-sided and maximal, and thus the spatialization of Max A is a locale [18] and coincides with\nI(Max A). Suppose now that P is any closed subspace of A. Then the image\nin the spatialization corresponds to the least closed ideal containing P , which\nequals A&P &A.\nThis theorem provides us with a large supply of C*-algebras with a nonspatial spectrum, and indeed C2 is probably the simplest example of such\nan algebra - Max C2 is infinite, whereas its spatialization I(Max C2 ) is a\nfour element Boolean algebra; alternatively, one can see immediately that\n{(x, x) | x \u2208 C} is maximal but not prime, whence Max C2 is not spatial by\nthe same argument of Example 3.4.\n12\n\n\fNow we turn to some functorial properties of spatialization. First, for\neach quantale Q let Q/\u223c be the spatialization with respect to a class of\npoints CQ of which we require only that the two following properties hold, in\nthe case when Q = Max A for some unital C*-algebra A:\n1. CMax A contains all the Hilbert points of Max A (cf. Example 2.10).\n2. If A is commutative then (Max A)/\u223c = I(Max A).\nFor each unital C*-algebra A let us write SpMax A for the quotient (Max A)/\u223c.\nIt is natural to ask whether SpMax can be extended to a functor from C*algebras to spatial quantales, as this would yield an interesting spectrum\nbecause it would coincide with the classical localic spectrum of the commutative case. In fact the answer turns out to be negative, at least if the\nfamily {SpatMax A }A is required to be a natural transformation from Max to\nSpMax. This means that spatialization of quantales in this sense is not as\nwell behaved as spatialization for locales, a not surprising fact due to the\nmismatch between arbitrary quantale homomorphisms, which are not necessarily strong, and irreducible representations, which are. The following\nresults provide a clear-cut argument.\nLemma 3.7 Let f : C2 \u2192 M2 (C) be the embedding of unital C*-algebras\ngiven by f (a, b) = (a0 0b ). Consider the pushout Q of Max f and SpatMax C2 in\nQu:\nMax C2\n\nMax f\n\n/\n\nMax M2 (C)\np\n\nSpatMax C2\n\n\u000f\n\nI(C2 )\n\nq\n\n/\n\n\u000f\n\nQ.\n\nThen Q is trivial.\nProof. Let E, F be the one-dimensional subspaces of C2 spanned by (1, 1)\nand (1, \u22121), respectively. Then SpatMax C2 (E) = SpatMax C2 (F ) = C2 . Since\n0\nthe subspaces spanned by the matrices (10 01 ) and (10 \u22121\n) are the images\n(Max f )(E) and (Max f )(F ), they must be equalized by p. Let\n\u001b\n\u001a\na a\n| a, b \u2208 C ,\nL =\nb b\n\u001b\n\u001a\nc d\n| c, d \u2208 C .\nR =\nc d\n13\n\n\fThen from\n\na a 1 0c d a a c d\nac ad\n=\n=2\n,\nb b 0 1c d b b c d\nbc bd\na a1 0 c d a \u2212ac d 0 0\n=\n=\n,\nb b 0 \u22121c d b \u2212b c d 0 0\n\nit follows that L&(Max f )(E)&R = M2 (C), while L&(Max f )(F )&R = {0}.\nHence, p(M2 (C)) = p({0}) and, since the diagram commutes, q(C2 ) =\nq({0}). This means that both p and q have the trivial image {0} \u2286 Q,\nand thus the trivial quantale Q = {0} is the pushout in Qu.\nLemma 3.8 SpMax M2 (C) is not trivial.\nProof. In order to show this it suffices to find a non-zero point of Max M2 (C).\nThe isomorphism \u0131 : M2 (C) \u2192 B(C2 ) is an irreducible representation of\nM2 (C) on C2 and gives rise to a Hilbert point \u0131\u0303 : Max M2 (C) \u2192 Q(L(C2 )),\nas in Example 2.10. This point is clearly non-zero, as for instance the identity\nmatrix spans a subspace of M2 (C) that acts as the identity on L(C2 ).\nTheorem 3.9 There is no functorial extension of SpMax such that the family {SpatQ }Q is a natural transformation.\nProof. Assume that there is a functorial extension of SpMax such that\n{SpatQ }Q is a natural transformation. Then we should have a commuting\ndiagram\nMax C2\n\nMax f\n\n/\n\nMax M2 (C)\nSpatMax M2 (C)\n\nSpatMax C2\n\n\u000f\n\nSpMax C2\n\nSpMax f\n\n/\n\n\u000f\n\nSpMax M2 (C) ,\n\nwhere f is defined as in Lemma 3.7 and SpMax C2 = I(C2 ). It follows that\nSpatMax M2 (C) must factor through the pushout of Lemma 3.7, which is 0.\nThus, SpMax M2 (C) must be trivial itself since SpatMax M2 (C) is onto, which\nleads to a contradiction with Lemma 3.8.\n\n14\n\n\f4\n\nExtending the localic spectrum\n\nThe previous section showed that for quantales of the form Max A, with A\ncommutative, the spatialization with respect to \"reasonable\" points is just\nthe locale of closed ideals of A. This suggests the possibility that a functor\nfrom C*-algebras to \"noncommutative spaces\" should have the property of\ncoinciding with the localic spectrum in the commutative case. In the previous section we have seen that there are difficulties in trying to define such a\nfunctor from Max via spatialization, so we now address this idea in a different\nway. We shall define a functor S from unital C*-algebras to quantales, requiring only that it should coincide with the localic spectrum in the commutative\ncase and that it preserve colimits, which has the advantage of opening the\nway to finding an adjunction between C*-algebras and quantales. We will\nsee, however, that under very general assumptions the spectrum of a C*algebra A given by such a functor is necessarily a locale, in fact coinciding\nwith the localic spectrum of the commutative reflection of A, which renders\nit uninteresting from the point of view of noncommutative topology, as was\nstated in the introduction.\nFrom here on let S denote a functor from C\u2217 to some category of involutive quantales Q that contains the category of locales, but which otherwise\nwill remain unspecified for the moment. An important observation is that\nany unital C*-algebra is a colimit of commutative unital C*-algebras (more\nprecisely, a quotient of a coproduct of commutative unital C*-algebras), and\nthus if S preserves all the colimits of C\u2217 and yields the localic spectrum in\nthe commutative case, it follows that the spectrum of an arbitrary unital\nC*-algebra is a colimit of locales in Q. In particular, the initial object of\nthe category should be preserved, which means that the two element chain\n2 = S(C) should be initial in Q. In this section we study the effects of these\nrestrictions when Q is made to coincide with certain subcategories of Qu\u2217 .\nNotice that Qu\u2217 itself is immediately ruled out because 2 is not initial in\nit. Hence, we focus on two particular subcategories, namely Qu\u2217e and Qu\u22171 ,\nboth of which have Loc as a full subcategory.\nFirst we recall that a strictly two-sided quantale is a unital quantale whose\nelements are all two-sided, or, equivalently, a unital quantale whose unit is the\ntop (see [24]). We can think of such a quantale as being a \"non-idempotent\nlocale\", for locales are exactly the strictly two-sided quantales whose multiplication is idempotent. We denote by Qu2 the category of strictly two-sided\nquantales and strong (=unital) homomorphisms, regarded as involutive quan15\n\n\ftales with the trivial involution a\u2217 = a. This is a full subcategory both of\nQu\u2217e and Qu\u22171 .\nLemma 4.1 Qu2 is closed under colimits, both in Qu\u2217e and in Qu\u22171 .\nProof. Qu2 has the same initial object of both categories, it is obviously\nclosed under coequalizers (the quotient of a strictly two-sided quantale is\nstrictly two-sided), so it remains to verify that it is closed under coproducts.\nLet {Qi }i be a family of strictly two-sided quantales. We first consider the\ncoproduct in Qu\u2217e . The unit of each quantale Qi is preserved by the respective\ncoprojection, and for each i we have a \u2264 e for all a \u2208 Qi , whence it follows\nthat all the generators of the coproduct are below the unit. Hence, the unit\nof the coproduct is the top because in any unital involutive quantale the\nset of elements below the unit is closed under multiplication, joins and the\ninvolution. Now let us consider Qu\u22171 . For each i the top of Qi is preserved\nby the respective coprojection, and thus the new top is a neutral element\nfor any finite non-empty multiplication of elements from the quantales Qi .\nAlso, we are not considering multiplications with zero length because we\ndo not require our coproduct quantale to be unital, so all the elements of\nthe coproduct are either finite non-empty multiplications or joins of these\n(the involution cannot generate new elements because it is preserved by the\ncoprojections), and thus the top is a neutral element.\nFrom here on we write Q to mean either Qu\u2217e or Qu\u22171 whenever the\ndistinction is not relevant.\nCorollary 4.2 A colimit of locales in Q is a strictly two-sided quantale.\nNow recall that a locale L is regular if each of its elements a \u2208 L is the\njoin of those a\u2032 \u2208 L which are well inside a (written a\u2032 0 a),\n_\na = {a\u2032 \u2208 L | a\u2032 0 a} ,\nwhere a\u2032 0 a means that a\u2032 \u2227 b = 0 and a \u2228 b = 1 for some b \u2208 L.\nLemma 4.3 Let {Li }i be a family\n` of locales, with all but at most one of the\nLi regular. Then the coproduct i Li in Q is calculated in Loc.\n16\n\n\fProof. If the family is empty the coproduct is`\nthe initial object, which is\nin Loc. Otherwise, we already know that L = i Li is a strictly two-sided\nquantale, so it is enough to show that it is also idempotent. First, we remark\nthat all the generators of L are idempotent because all the coprojections \u03b9i :\nLi \u2192 L are quantale homomorphisms. Furthermore, a join of idempotents is\nidempotent, and if two idempotents a and b commute then a&b is idempotent:\na&b&a&b = a&a&b&b = a&b .\nHence, to finish the proof we will show that \u03b9i (a) and \u03b9j (b) commute for all\na \u2208 Li and b \u2208 Lj . ByWassumption at least one of Li and Lj is regular, so\nassume that b is a join k bk with bk 0 b for all k. For each k let then ck \u2208 Lj\nbe an element such that bk \u2227 ck = 0 and b \u2228 ck = 1. We obtain\n\u03b9i (a)&\u03b9j (bk ) = \u03b9j (b \u2228 ck )&\u03b9i (a)&\u03b9j (bk )\n= \u03b9j (b)&\u03b9i (a)&\u03b9j (bk ) \u2228 \u03b9j (ck )&\u03b9i (a)&\u03b9j (bk )\n\u2264 \u03b9j (b)&\u03b9i (a) \u2228 \u03b9j (ck \u2227 bk ) = \u03b9j (b)&\u03b9i (a) ,\nW\nand thus \u03b9i (a)&\u03b9j (b) = \u03b9i (a)&\u03b9j (bk ) \u2264 \u03b9j (b)&\u03b9i (a). Similarly, multiplying\nby \u03b9j (b \u2228 ck ) on the right we obtain \u03b9j (b)&\u03b9i (a) \u2264 \u03b9i (a)&\u03b9j (b).\nCorollary 4.4 The category KRLoc of compact regular locales is closed\nunder colimits in Q.\nProof. It is well known that KRLoc is closed under colimits in Loc (see,\ne.g., [10]), which in turn is obviously closed under coequalizers in Q. The\nprevious lemma shows that the coproduct of compact regular locales in Q is\nalso calculated in Loc and, therefore, in KRLoc.\nTheorem 4.5 Let S : C\u2217 \u2192 Q be a functor that preserves colimits, and such\nthat S(B) = I(B) for every commutative unital C*-algebra B. Let also A be\nan arbitrary unital C*-algebra. Then S(A) is the locale of closed ideals of the\ncommutative reflection of A.\nProof. Let A be a unital C*-algebra, obtained as a colimit lim\nBi , in C\u2217 , of\n\u2212\u2192\ncommutative unital C*-algebras. Then S(A) is a colimit lim\nI(Bi ) of compact\n\u2212\u2192\nregular locales in Q, and by the above results this colimit is calculated in\nKRLoc. The commutative reflection functor of unital C*-algebras preserves\n17\n\n\fcolimits because it is a left adjoint, and thus the commutative reflection of A\ncan be obtained as a \"similar\" colimit as A, but calculated in CC\u2217 instead of\nC\u2217 . Furthermore, the localic spectrum I : CC\u2217 \u2192 KRLoc preserves colimits\nbecause it is an equivalence of categories, and thus the localic spectrum of\nthe commutative reflection of A equals lim\nI(Bi ) = S(A).\n\u2212\u2192\n\n5\n\nFunctorial properties of Max\n\nIn recent work [14] a different approach is taken to spatiality of involutive\nquantales, essentially motivated by [9]. In particular it is shown that any\nquantale Max A is spatial with respect to the Hilbert points, provided one\nchanges the definition of spatiality so that it applies to right-sided elements\nonly, following from the idea [1, 9] that the topology of Max A is provided\nby the right-sided elements. Explicitly, a quantale Q is spatial in this sense\nif and only if for any distinct right-sided elements a and b there is a point\np of Q such that p(a) 6= p(b). Of course, a general notion of spatialization\nin this sense is likely to suffer from the same problems we met in \u00a73, but\nthis need not concern us because Max A is already spatial in the new sense.\nInstead we may focus on the functor Max itself. We claim that Max has\nsome pleasing properties, namely that it is faithful and a complete invariant\nof unital C*-algebras. Hence, it is an interesting candidate via which to search\nfor an equivalence of categories that generalizes the Gelfand duality of the\ncommutative case, although this is certainly far from being straightforward\nbecause as we will see Max does not have any adjoints.\nLet us first see that Max does not preserve colimits, and thus it does not\nhave a right adjoint:\nTheorem 5.1 Max : C\u2217 \u2192 Que does not preserve coproducts.\nProof. Let C2 + C2 denote the sum of C2 with itself in the category of unital\nC*-algebras. The sum in the category of commutative unital C*-algebras is\nC4 and there is a quotient morphism C2 + C2 \u2192 C4 . Hence, we have an onto\nunital homomorphism of quantales Max (C2 + C2 ) \u2192 Max C4 (notice that\nMax f is onto whenever f is). If the coproduct Max C2 + Max C2 in Que\nwere isomorphic to Max (C2 + C2 ) then there would be, by composition, an\nonto homomorphism h : Max C2 + Max C2 \u2192 Max C4 that would make the\n\n18\n\n\ffollowing diagram commute,\nMax C2 WWWWW\n\nWWWWWMax \u03b31\nWWWW\nWWWWW\nWWWW\n\u000f\n+\nh\n2\n2\n/ Max C4\nMax C +O Max C\n3\ng\nggggg\ng\ng\ng\ng\n\u03ba2\nggg\ngggggMax \u03b32\nggggg\n\u03ba1\n\nMax C2\n\nwhere \u03ba1 and \u03ba2 are the coprojections of the coproduct in Que , and \u03b31 and \u03b32\nare the coprojections of the coproduct in the category of commutative unital\nC*-algebras. In order to see that sums are not preserved we will show that h is\nnot onto. This is equivalent to showing that the unital involutive subquantale\nQ of Max C4 generated by the union of the images of Max \u03b31 and Max \u03b32 is\nnot the whole quantale Max C4 . For this we look at \u03b31 and \u03b32 in detail. These\ncoprojections are the duals of the projections of the product of two discrete\ntopological spaces with two points, {x, y} \u00d7 {x, y}. We denote the complex\nvalued functions f : {x, y} \u2192 C by ordered pairs (f (x), f (y)). Similarly, we\ndenote the functions on the product space, f : {(x, x), (x, y), (y, x), (y, y)} \u2192\nC, by 4-tuples (f (x, x), f (x, y), f (y, x), f (y, y)). The two projections of the\nproduct thus have the following duals:\n\u03b31\n\n(z, w) 7\u2192 (z, z, w, w) ,\n\u03b32\n\n(z, w) 7\u2192 (z, w, z, w) .\nIn any quantale Max A we have, for all a, b \u2208 A, hai&hbi = habi, where\nhai and hbi are the one dimensional subspaces spanned by a and b. The\none dimensional subspaces are the atoms of Max A, and an atom hai cannot be obtained as the join of different atoms, for if a 6= b then hai \u2228 hbi\nis a two dimensional subspace. Consider now the one dimensional subspace\nh(1, 0, 1, 1)i of Max C4 . For this subspace to be in Q it is necessary that\n(z, z, w, w)(z \u2032 , w \u2032, z \u2032 , w \u2032 ) = (1, 0, 1, 1) for some z, w, z \u2032 , w \u2032 \u2208 C (the involution is of no use, of course). But then either z or w \u2032 must be 0, whence\n(zz \u2032 , zw \u2032 , wz \u2032 , ww \u2032) must contain at least two zeros, and we conclude that h\nis not onto.\nIt is worth remarking that Max does not preserve limits, either, so it does\nnot have a left adjoint:\n19\n\n\fTheorem 5.2 Max does not preserve products.\nProof. Max C is the two element chain 2, and thus Max C\u00d7Max C is the four\nelement boolean algebra. However, C2 contains infinitely many subspaces,\nwhence Max (C \u00d7 C) \u223c\n6= Max C \u00d7 Max C.\nTheorem 5.3 Max is faithful.\nProof. This is a corollary of Proposition 2.3 in [26], for if f : A \u2192 B is a\nmorphism of unital C*-algebras the map Rf : RA \u2192 RB on closed right\nideals can be defined by Rf (J) = Max f (J)&B.\nFinally, from the results in [9, 15] it follows [22] that Max is a complete\ninvariant of unital C*-algebras (see also [5, 26, 18]):\nTheorem 5.4 Let A and B be unital C*-algebras. Then A and B are isomorphic if and only if Max A and Max B are isomorphic as unital involutive\nquantales.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors thank Chris Mulvey for his comments on an earlier draft of this\npaper.\n\nReferences\n[1] C.
