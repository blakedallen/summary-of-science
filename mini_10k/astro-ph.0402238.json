The extent and mass of dust in disks\nhave been determined from IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and imaging (see review\nby Zuckerman 2001). Cold gas at large radii is traced by observations of molecules such\nas CO and HCN (e.g., Aikawa et al. 2002). Warmer neutral and ionized gases are used as\ndiagnostics of accretion (e.g., Gomez de Castro & Lamzin 1999; Johns-Krull & Gafford 2002).\nHowever, observing the gas in the disk close to the star, which is important for the formation\nand evolution of planets, has been difficult. Gas at these radii can induce planet migration\n(Goldreich & Tremaine 1979), dampen the eccentricity of terrestrial planets (Agnor & Ward\n2002), and is neccessary for accretion onto giant planets (Lissauer 1993).\nIn search of gas at planet-forming radii, Calvet et al. (1991) investigated the formation\nof CO overtone lines at 2.3 \u03bcm in disks around CTTSs. These models predict that CTTSs\nas a group should show both CO emission and absorption, while Herbig Ae/Be stars should\nshow CO in emission. Using high spectral resolution observations, Carr et al. (1993) showed\nthat the CO overtone emission from the probable Herbig Ae/Be star WL 16 arises in the\ninner disk, confirming the prediction of Calvet et al. (1991). Najita et al. (1996) find the\nsame result for the Herbig Ae/Be star 1548C27. However, broader searches at high spectral\nresolution for CO overtone emission or absorption from CTTSs generally find no evidence\nfor contributions to these lines from the disks around these stars (Casali & Eiroa 1996;\nJohns-Krull & Valenti 2001a). On the other hand, Najita, Carr, & Mathieu (2003) find that\nCO fundamental emission near 4.6 - 4.9 \u03bcm is common among CTTSs. They suggest that\novertone emission has not been detected at the observed CO temperatures (1100 \u2013 1300 K),\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nmainly because the overtone bands have much lower transition rates. However, CO is not\nexpected to be the dominant gas constituent in the disks around CTTSs, and it is the major\ncomponent of the gas, H2 , that we seek to probe here.\nPrevious observations of H2 have not provided a clear picture of the gas in the disk. Thi\net al. (2001) detected cold H2 emission in the pure rotational S(0) and S(1) lines from ISO\nobservations of a large sample of CTTSs, Herbig Ae/Be stars, and debris-disk stars. However,\nin ground-based observations of the S(1) and S(2) lines, using much smaller apertures than\nISO, Richter et al. (2001) and Sheret et al. (2003) did not detect any H2 emission from some\nof the same sources, indicating that the emission is probably extended. On the other hand,\nthe emission in the H2 1-0 S(1) transition detected by Bary, Weintraub, & Kastner (2003)\nin Phoenix spectra of 4 T Tauri stars is narrow and centered at the radial velocity of the\nstars, presumably formed in low-velocity circumstellar gas.\nWhile H2 lines in the IR are typically weak and are observed against a strong dust\ncontinuum, fluorescent H2 lines dominate the far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectrum of CTTSs at\nwavelengths longward of Ly\u03b1. Ardila et al. (2002a) found that narrow H2 lines can be\nblueshifted by up to 20 km s\u22121 in HST /GHRS spectra of CTTSs, observed with a 2\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 2\u2032\u2032\naperture. High-resolution echelle and long-slit spectroscopy with HST /STIS is providing the\ncritical data needed to identify the source of the H2 emission. Observations of T Tau reveal\ntwo components of H2 emission. Saucedo et al. (2003) and Walter et al. (2003) detect offsource UV H2 emission, that is pumped near line-center of Ly\u03b1, and most likely produced\nwhere stellar outflows shock the surrounding ambient molecular material. The same set\nof fluorescent H2 lines are detected in low-excitation HH objects such as HH43 and HH47\n(Schwartz 1983; Curiel et al. 1995), suggestive of a similar excitation mechanism. Walter\net al. (2003) find that the on-source H2 emission is photoexcited by a much broader Ly\u03b1\nemission line, likely produced by the accretion shock at the surface of T Tau.\nIn Herczeg et al. (2002, hereafter Paper I), we presented observations of H2 fluorescence in the UV spectrum of TW Hya obtained with HST /STIS and FUSE. Several lines\nof evidence suggested a disk origin for the H2 emission: (i) the H2 emission is not spatially\nextended beyond a point source in the cross-dispersion direction, (ii) the H2 lines are emitted interior to TW Hya's wind because emission in one H2 line is supressed by C II wind\nabsorption, (iii) the H2 line centroids have the same radial velocity as the photospheric lines\nof TW Hya, (iv) no H2 absorption is detected against the Ly\u03b1 emission, and (v) the TW\nHya Association is isolated from large reservoirs of interstellar molecular material, making\na circumstellar origin for the H2 emission unlikely. Because the H2 emission is not extended\nbeyond a point source, the spatial resolution of HST /STIS restricts the emitting region to\nbe within 2 AU of the star.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nAnalysis of on-source IR H2 emission lines to date has been limited because typically only\none or two lines are observed. The IR lines could be excited by shocks, UV fluorescence,\nX-rays, or thermal heating. In contrast, over 140 H2 lines from 19 different upper levels\nare detected in the FUV spectrum of TW Hya. The excitation of H2 can be determined\nfrom relative line strengths in this rich spectrum either by measuring self-absorption in low\nexcitation members of individual fluorescent progressions or by using an assumed Ly\u03b1 profile\nto reconstruct initial level populations in various pumping transitions.\nIn this paper, we calculate the temperature of warm gas at planet-forming distances by\nmodelling warm H2 in a disk around TW Hya. We use the H2 emission to reconstruct the\nLy\u03b1 profile incident on the fluoresced H2 . The observed Ly\u03b1 profile differs from the incident\nprofile because of interstellar absorption along our line of sight to TW Hya. We discuss the\nstrength of Ly\u03b1 emission and its affect on the circumstellar disk.\n\n2.\n\nPROPERTIES OF TW HYA\n\nTW Hya is the namesake of the 10 Myr old TW Hya Association (TWA), which most\nlikely originated in the Sco-Cen OB association (Mamajek, Lawson, & Feigelson 2000). TW\nHya is one of the oldest known stars still in the CTTS phase, and its mass accretion rate of\nabout 2 \u2212 3 \u00d7 10\u22129 M\u2299 yr\u22121 is lower than the mass accretion rate of most of the 1\u20132 Myr\nold CTTSs that are found in Taurus (Kenyon & Hartmann 1995). From PMS evolutionary\ntracks, Webb et al. (1999) estimate that TW Hya has a mass of 0.7 M\u2299 and a radius of 1.0\nR\u2299 . Gaseous material is often associated with young stars, but is not found in the nearby\nTWA, so the extinction is low. The TWA is located at a distance of approximately 56 pc\n(Webb et al. 1999), compared with 140 pc for Taurus. Consequently, TW Hya is by far the\nbrightest known CTTS in the UV and in X-rays. Most of the UV radiation from TW Hya\nis presumably produced at the accretion shock. The disk is viewed face-on (e.g., Zuckerman\net al. 1995; Alencar & Batalha 2002), which prevents signficant Keplerian broadening in the\nH2 line profiles. The disk mass is roughly (1.5 \u2212 3) \u00d7 10\u22122 M\u2299 (Wilner et al. 2000; Trilling\net al. 2001) and extends more than 225 AU from the star (e.g. Krist et al. 2000). Based on\nestimates of the stellar mass, radius, and rotation period of TW Hya, Johns-Krull & Valenti\n(2001b) calculate that the disk at 6 R\u2217 corotates with the stellar surface. In the Shu et al.\n(1994) model, the disk is truncated at corotation. Weinberger et al. (2002) estimate from\nmodelling the IR SED of TW Hya that the dust in the disk is truncated at about 11 R\u2217 .\nIn their models of the IR SED, Calvet et al. (2002) found an underabundance micron-sized\ndust grains within 4 AU of TW Hya. Figure 1 shows a schematic model of TW Hya and its\ndisk.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nSince the mass accretion rate of CTTSs can vary, we calculate the mass accretion rate\nat the epoch when we observed TW Hya. We then proceed to estimate the extinction using\nH I absorption against Ly\u03b1 emission and the SED of the NUV continuum that is produced\nin an accretion shock. The observations discussed in this paper were described in Paper I\nand are listed in Table 1.\n\n2.1.\n\nMass Accretion Rate\n\nThe strong excess blue and UV emission from CTTSs can be modelled as emission from\nshocks at accretion footpoints on the star, which leads to estimates of the mass accretion\nrate. We estimate the accretion rate of TW Hya by following the method of Valenti, Basri, &\nJohns (1993), who modelled observed blue spectra with the sum of a photospheric template\nand emission from a slab of hot isothermal hydrogen to crudely simulate emission from the\naccretion shock.\nWe use the HST/STIS spectrum of the K7 weak-lined TTS V819 Tau (see Table 1),\nspanning 1100\u20136000 \u00c5, as a non-accreting template for the photospheric emission from TW\nHya. For V819 Tau we adopt a visual extinction of AV = 1.52, which is the average of values\ndetermined by Kenyon & Hartmann (1995) and White & Ghez (2001). We then use the\ninterstellar extinction law of Cardelli et al. (1989) to remove the effects of extinction from\nthe observed spectrum of V819 Tau. The NUV and FUV emission from V819 Tau is much\nfainter than that of TW Hya, and is not significant in this analysis.\nThe spectrum of the model slab is determined by the slab temperature T , density n,\nthickness l, extinction AV towards the slab, and a slab surface area parameter \u03b4, as described\nin Valenti et al. (1993). The slab surface area parameter \u03b4 corresponds to the fraction of\nthe stellar surface area covered by accretion-related emission, and is calculated from the\nscale factor applied to the slab spectrum. The scaling factor between the non-accreting\ntemplate star and TW Hya is another free parameter. We find the best-fit model parameters\nby fitting the synthetic slab spectrum plus the scaled template spectrum to the NUV and\noptical spectrum of TW Hya, minimizing \u03c72 using the amoeba function in IDL, which is\nbased on the downhill simplex minimization method. The best-fit parameters for the slab\nare AV = 0.0, T = 9900 K, n = 1.7 \u00d7 1014 cm\u22123 , l = 125 km, \u03b4 = 0.008, and a template\nscaling factor of 1.18.\nFigure 2 shows our fit to the optical spectrum of TW Hya, after subtracting the scaled\ntemplate spectrum of V819 Tau. The accretion continuum calculated in this model is consistent with the observed NUV continuum. However, the observed continuum flux rises\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nshortward of 1700 \u00c5, which could result from (i) an H2 dissociation continuum produced by\nelectron collisions (Liu & Dalgarno 1996), (ii) H2 fluorescence pumped by the FUV continuum, or (iii) by a hot accretion or activity component. The SED of the FUV continuum is\nsimilar to the continuum observed in HH2, which is probably produced by H2 dissociation\n(Raymond et al. 1997). However, the FUV continuum of TW Hya appears smooth and does\nnot show strong H2 emission lines at 1054 \u00c5 and 1101 \u00c5, which are detected towards HH2.\nAssuming that half of the potential energy of the accreting gas is converted into hydrogen\ncontinuum emission2 , then the mass accretion rate of TW Hya can be estimated by\n\u1e40\u2217 =\n\n1.25R\u2217 Lslab\n,\nGM\u2217\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Lslab = 3.5 \u00d7 10\u221210 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 is the slab flux integrated over all wavelengths. The\nleading factor of 1.25, derived by Gullbring et al. (1998) for a magnetospheric accretion\ngeometry, replaces the factor of 2 from a spherical accretion geometry. We adopt 0.7 M\u2299\nand 1.0 R\u2299 for the mass and radius of TW Hya (Webb et al. 1999). Uncertainties in the\nstellar mass, radius, and distance are all of order 20%. We calculate an accretion rate onto\nthe star of \u1e40 \u2248 2 \u00d710\u22129 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , which is consistent with the accretion rate of 2 \u00d710\u22129 M\u2299\nyr\u22121 estimated by Alencar & Batalha (2002) using a similar method, and is larger than the\naccretion rate of 5 \u00d7 10\u221210 M\u2299 yr\u22121 estimated by Muzerolle et al. (2000) using an analysis\nof the H\u03b1 line.\n\n2.2.\n\nExtinction to TW Hya\n\nIn this section, we argue that the extinction to TW Hya is negligible by measuring the\nhydrogen column density directly from the shape of the observed Ly\u03b1 line, and then using\nan ISM extinction law to infer the dust extinction. This argument does not necessarily imply\nthat the extinction towards the warm H2 is negligible, because some dust could be mixed\nwith the warm H2 , leading to extinction of H2 fluxes without any extinction of the stellar or\naccretion emission. We will discuss this possibility in \u00a75.\nFigure 3 shows the observed Ly\u03b1 profile, which is likely produced in an accretion column,\ncontains a dark, broad absorption feature that extends from +200 km s\u22121 to -500 km s\u22121 .\nThe absorption is produced by H I in the wind and in interstellar and circumstellar material.\nBecause circumstellar and interstellar absorption are indistinguishable in our data, we model\nthese two features with a single absorption feature. All UV spectra of CTTSs show similar\n2\n\nSee Lynden-Bell & Pringle (1974) and Hartigan et al. (1991) for details.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nwind absorption in Mg II (Ardila et al. 2002b), so the star must be occulted by the outflow,\nregardless of inclination angle.\nIn the following analysis, we fit two Gaussian emission profiles and either one or two\nVoigt absorption profiles to the observed Ly\u03b1 profile. The intrinsic emission profile is assumed to be a double-Gaussian profile, and the parameters of the Gaussians are allowed to\nvary to best fit the observed profile when combined with the absorption. Based on the widely\nseparated wind and interstellar absorption features observed in the O I 1302 \u00c5, C II 1334 \u00c5,\nand Mg II 2795 \u00c5 lines, the interstellar and wind absorption components towards TW Hya\nmust be centered at v = 0 and \u2212130 km s\u22121 , respectively. For the interstellar component\nwe assume a Doppler parameter of b = 11 km s\u22121 , which corresponds to a temperature of\n7000 K that is typical of the local (warm) ISM (Redfield & Linsky 2000). An interstellar\ncolumn density is then determined by fitting the absorption longward of line center, where\nany wind absorption should be negligible. The wind absorption extends to a velocity of at\nleast -500 km s\u22121 , and likely has a large Doppler parameter due to velocity gradients along\nour line of sight. Given these assumptions, the interstellar neutral hydrogen column density\nin our line of sight is log N(H I) = 19.05 \u00b1 0.15 (Fig. 3). The upper limit of the column\ndensity in the wind is N(H I) < 19.4 for Doppler parameters b > 25 km s\u22121\nIn a more conservative test to find the upper limit to the hydrogen column density, we\nfit the Ly\u03b1 absorption with a single component, effectively combining any interstellar and\nwind absorption. We vary the central wavelength of the absorption and set a low Doppler\nparameter parameter, so that the damping wings generate the width of the absorption profile. Figure 4 shows that the maximum possible column density consistent with the data is\nlog N(H I) = 19.75.\nThe conservative upper limit of the hydrogen column density towards TW Hya is therefore log N(H) < 19.75. In the only previous measurement of N(H I) to TW Hya, Kastner\net al. (1999) used X-ray spectral energy distributions from ROSAT and ASCA to estimate\nhigher column densities of log N(H I) = 20.5 \u00b1 0.4 and 21.4 \u00b1 0.1, respectively. However, the X-ray analyses are highly reliant on the accuracy of plasma codes. Kastner et al.\n(1999) estimate the hydrogen column density by assuming solar abundances and using a\ntwo-temperature emission measure rather than a differential emission measure distribution.\nHowever, in their analysis of the Chandra X-ray spectrum of TW Hya, Kastner et al. (2002)\nfound that the abundances show an inverse-FIP effect. We further note that the sensitivity\nand flux calibration of ROSAT and ASCA are relatively poor at soft energies, where absorption from H I ionization is measured. Figure 4 shows that the absorption calculated for\nthe Ly\u03b1 line for log N(H I) = 20.5 is signficantly broader than the observed absorption profile. Our comparison of the calculated transmission function with the observed Ly\u03b1 profile\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nprovides a much simpler and more direct test of hydrogen column density than the X-ray\nanalyses. The discrepancy between the UV and X-ray measurements of N(H) could in principle be due to a variable circumstellar absorber, which Kastner et al. (1999) invoked to explain\nthe order of magnitude discrepancy in calculations of N(H) from ASCA and ROSAT. However, the many ultraviolet observations of TW Hya by IUE, HST /STIS, and FUSE, which\nare widely spaced in time, show no evidence for large fluctuations in extinction.\nWe estimate an H2 column density in our line of sight to TW Hya with FUSE, as the\nbandpass contains many H2 transitions from low rotational levels of the ground electronic\nstate, which are often seen in absorption due to the ISM at temperatures typically \u223c 100 K\n(Rachford et al. 2002). H2 absorption lines from v \u2032\u2032 = 0, J \u2032\u2032 = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 can in principle be\nobserved against O VI emission (e.g. Roberge et al. 2001). The O VI profiles are noisy (see\nFig. 5), but we estimate an upper limit of log N(H2 ) < 18 by calculating the transmission\npercentage for a range of temperatures and column densities, meaning the molecular fraction\nof H towards TW Hya is very low.\nWhen we convert total hydrogen column density, N(H I)+2N(H2 ) = N(H), to a reddening using the interstellar relationship of Bohlin, Savage, & Drake (1978),\nN(HI + H2 )\n= 5.8 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 ,\nE(B \u2212 V )\n\n(2)\n\nwe find that the reddening toward TW Hya is E(B \u2212 V ) = AV /RV < 0.01, where RV is\na dimensionless parameter that ranges between 2.5\u20136, depending on the size distribution of\ndust grains. Significant deviations from the assumed dust-to-gas ratio can occur in starforming regions such as \u03c1 Oph, in which the dust grains are likely larger than they are in the\nISM. However, the low molecular fraction towards TW Hya is consistent with a low extinction\n(Savage et al. 1977; Rachford et al. 2002), and is not consistent with material found towards\nstar-forming regions. We conclude that this relationship provides a reasonable estimate of\nthe extinction along our sightline to TW Hya. Even if the dust-to-gas ratio along the line\nof sight to TW Hya were for some reason enhanced by an order of magnitude, then dust\nextinction would reduce the brightness of TW Hya by a factor of 2 and have only a 20%\neffect on the relative fluxes between 1200 \u00c5 and 1650 \u00c5.\nInspection of the NUV continuum (Fig. 6) confirms the small extinction to TW Hya.\nIf we assume that the NUV continuum is produced in an isothermal slab, as modelled in\n\u00a72.1, then it can be well fitted with a hydrogen continuum only for extinctions AV < 0.2.\nAs noted in \u00a72.1, an accretion continuum best fits the NUV continuum for AV = 0.0.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n3.\n\nMODELLING H2 LINE FLUXES\n\nIn Paper I, we measured a total line emission flux of 1.94 \u00d7 10\u221212 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 by\nsumming 146 H2 emission lines in the 19 progressions (the set of R and P transitions from\na common upper level) listed in Table 2. Most of these lines are Lyman-band transitions\nfluoresced by the strong, broad Ly\u03b1 emission line.\nWood, Karovska, & Raymond (2002) discovered in their analysis of HST /STIS observations of Mira B that H2 fluxes weaken towards short wavelengths because of increasing\nH2 line opacities. This occurs because shorter wavelength lines are transitions to low energy levels, which are more populated than higher levels. Figure 7 demonstrates that the\nsame effect occurs in the H2 fluorescence sequences detected towards TW Hya. In most\nsequences, fluxes in many H2 emission lines at short wavelengths are weaker than predicted\nfrom theoretical branching ratios because of significant absorption in the same transitions.\nTransitions from levels with low excitation energies, such as v \u2032 =0, J \u2032 =1, have significant\noptical depth below 1300 \u00c5, but this does not happen for transitions from levels with large\nexcitation energies such as v \u2032 =4, J \u2032 =18 (see Fig. 7). The v \u2032 =4, J \u2032 =18 level does not have\nany downward transitions with significant opacity in the STIS bandpass.\nFollowing the Monte Carlo method of Wood et al. (2002), we compute H2 opacities by\nmodelling H2 fluorescence in a 1D isothermal plane-parallel atmosphere of H2 irradiated by\nLy\u03b1 photons. We assume complete frequency and angular redistribution when photons scatter in the slab. Forty-one wavelength grid points across each H2 line profile track differences\nin escape probability across the line profile because because a photon that scatters into the\nwings of a line escapes from a slab more easily than a photon at line center. A Ly\u03b1 photon\nenters the slab at an angle \u03b8 with respect to the slab surface normal and photoexcites an H2\nmolecule. The H2 molecule quickly de-excites to the ground electronic state through one of\nthe many available routes, or dissociates with a probability PDis [listed in Table 2, calculated\nby Abgrall, Roueff, & Drira (2000)]. Depending on the optical depth of H2 in the lower level\nof the downward transition, the resulting photon may be temporarily absorbed by another\nH2 molecule or may emerge from either side of the slab at an angle \u03c6 with respect to the\nnormal. In our simple model, H2 line photons created fluorescently in the slab either escape,\nare converted to another H2 line in the same progression, or dissociate an H2 molecule. No\nother photon processes are considered. We tabulate photons that exit the slab on the Ly\u03b1\nentry side (reflected photons) and opposite side (transmitted photons) using 40 bins of equal\nsolid angle on each side of the slab. We refer the reader to Wood et al. (2002) for further\ndetails of this Monte Carlo code.\nWe use the term \"model\" to refer to the simulated plane-parallel atmosphere described\nin the preceding paragraph, and the term \"geometry\" to refer to the morphology of the H2\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\naround the Ly\u03b1 emission source. In the context of the model, the H2 line fluxes depend on\nthe temperature and column density of the slab, the angle of incidence \u03b8 of the Ly\u03b1 photon\ninto the disk, the outward angle \u03c6 of the emerging photon, the side of the slab from which\nthe photon escapes, and the optical depth of the transition. We assume that extinction is\nnegligible in the slab and in any interstellar material. Figure 8 shows two possible geometries\nthat we use to approximate a thick disk and a thin disk. The term \"thick disk\" applies to\na star-disk geometry in which most of the H2 illuminated by Ly\u03b1 is at the inner edge of\nthe disk. The term \"thin disk\" applies to a geometry in which most of the H2 illuminated\nby Ly\u03b1 is at the disk surface. In this section and \u00a74, we present detailed results for the\nthick disk geometry that reproduces the data well. In this adopted geometry, Ly\u03b1 photons\nenter the slab normally (\u03b8 = 0\u25e6 ), and the H2 photons that we observe emerge at an angle\n\u03c6 = 76\u25e6 \u2212 79\u25e6 to the normal. This choice is intended to present one approximation of a\nplausible disk geometry for which we can present detailed results, and is not meant to exclude\nother geometries. In \u00a75, we present general results for many geometries to demonstrate that\nour primary result, the temperature of the H2 gas, is relatively insensitive to geometries,\nincluding those that are significantly different from the adopted geometry.\nWe calculate the relative flux of each transition within a single progression, given an H2\nexcitation temperature and column density of the slab, and a separate flux normalization\nfactor for each progression. Models are calculated for temperatures in the range T =1000\u2013\n5500 K, sampled at 100 K intervals, and column densities (in cgs units) of log N(H2 )=15\u201323,\nsampled at 0.1 dex intervals. N(H2 ) and T are then determined by fitting simultaneously\nthe relative line fluxes for 19 observed progressions. Five lines are not used because they\nare blended, and one line is not used because it is anomalously weak due to C II wind\nabsorption (see Paper I). The FUSE lines, observed six weeks after the STIS observations,\nare not used in building these models due to the potential problems with flux variability\nand cross-calibration between STIS and FUSE. The fits have 21 variables: 19 normalization\nfactors, N(H2 ), and T . In typical models, 46 of the 140 H2 line fluxes are sensitive to H2 line\nopacity, and hence N(H2 ) and T . The other 94 lines, which have only a weak dependence\non N(H2 ) and T , determine the 19 normalization factors. We calculate \u03c72H2 for only the 46\nlines which depend on N(H2 ) and T . Confidence contours of 1 \u2212 5\u03c3, calculated from values\nof \u2206\u03c72\u03bd,H2 for 44 degrees of freedom, are shown in Figure 9, with a minimum \u03c72\u03bd,H2 = 2.22 at\nlog N(H2 ) = 17.9 and T = 2600 K.\nBased on this analysis, and additional constraints provided by the Ly\u03b1 profile analysis\ndescribed in \u00a74, we ultimately decide a thick disk model with T = 2500 K and log N(H2 ) =\n18.5 is our best model, which we adopt for the analysis (see \u00a76.1). Figure 10 compares\nthe observed spectrum compared with a synthetic spectrum computed from this model. The\nadopted model correctly predicts the fluxes of all strong H2 lines. Only one observed line flux\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\ndiffers significantly from the model flux. The model predicts a flux of 46\u00d710\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121\nin the 0-4 R(1) transition at 1333.797 \u00c5. The measured flux in this line, (7.9 \u00b1 0.7) \u00d7 10\u221215\nerg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , is significantly reduced by C II wind absorption, as discussed in Paper I.\nThe 0-3 P(3) transition at 1283.16 \u00c5, with a measured flux of 28.0 \u00d7 10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 ,\nis moderately weaker than the model flux of 34.8 \u00d7 0\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , possibly because of\nH2 absorption in the 2-2 R(15) transition, centered 8 km s\u22121 from the 0-3 P(3) transition.\nTable 3 lists predicted fluxes for Lyman-band H2 transitions in the FUSE bandpass. Future\nmeasurements of flux in these transitions would provide a good test for our model. Lines at\n\u03bb < 1200 provide particularly good constraints since they are transitions to very low energy\nlevels, and as a result have large opacities.\nNeither this model nor the alternative models presented in \u00a75 rigorously simulate a\ndisk geometry. Because the structure of disks is uncertain near the truncation radii, we\ndo not have an accurate picture of the geometry of the H2 emission region. Without this\na priori knowledge, the thick disk geometry described here is not clearly better or worse\nthan any other oversimplified geometry that we might assume. In \u00a75, we will show that\nthe temperature of the molecular region is relatively insensitive to geometry, and we will\nrule out certain geometries that cannot sufficiently explain the observed H2 spectrum. Since\nour models make as few assumptions as possible, the primary result of this paper, the\ntemperature of the H2 gas, may apply to a wide range of other morphologies.\n\n4.\n\nRECONSTRUCTED Ly\u03b1 PROFILE\n\nIn this section, we reconstruct the Ly\u03b1 profile seen by the warm H2 gas at the 18\npumping wavelengths between 1212\u20131220 \u00c5. Fluorescent H2 emission occurs because certain\nLyman-band transitions, with lower levels 1 \u2212 2 eV above the ground state, have wavelength\ncoincidences with the broad Ly\u03b1 profile. The emission in each progression depends on the\nLy\u03b1 flux at the pumping wavelength of the fluorescent transition, the upward transition\nprobability, the opacity in the pumping transition, and the filling factor of H2 as seen from\nthe source of the Ly\u03b1 emission. We reconstruct the incident Ly\u03b1 profile following a procedure similar to that used by Wood et al. (2002) to analyze fluorescent H2 emission in\nthe HST /STIS spectrum of Mira B. A comparison of the reconstructed and observed Ly\u03b1\nprofiles provide another constraint on the values of T and N(H2 ), that is independent of the\nconstraints provided by the analysis presented in \u00a73. The analysis in \u00a73 relied upon using\nthe H2 flux ratios within each fluorescence progression to constrain T and N(H2 ), whereas\nthe Ly\u03b1 profile reconstruction analysis presented in this section relies only on the total flux\nfrom each upper level.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nWe calculate the optical depth in each H2 pumping transition by assuming that the\nabsorption line profiles in the model slab are Voigt functions with a Doppler b parameter,\nwhich depends on an assumed temperature, and a damping parameter a from Abgrall et al.\n(1993). The total Ly\u03b1 flux, Fabs , absorbed by a given lower level is then\nZ\nFabs = \u03b7 \u00d7 Finc \u00d7 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4\u03bb [T,N (H2 )] d\u03bb\n(3)\n\u03bb\n\nR\nwhere Finc is the incident Ly\u03b1 flux per unit wavelength and \u03bb 1 \u2212 exp\u2212\u03c4\u03bb [T,N (H2 )] d\u03bb is the\nequivalent width of the absorption profile within the slab (see EQWslab in Table 2). Not\nevery absorbed Ly\u03b1 photon produces an observed H2 photon. For the most highly excited\nstates, the dissociation probability (Pdis in Table 2) can be as large as 42%. Some fraction\n(Runseen in Table 2) of the emitted photons will be in spectral lines that we did not observe\ndue to line blends, noisy data, or insufficient wavelength coverage. In our plane-parallel slab\nmodel, an emerging photon travelling normal to the slab sees a smaller optical depth than\na photon travelling nearly parallel to the slab. As a result, the emitted flux in these models\nis largest for angles normal to the slab.\nFor comparison with the observed Ly\u03b1 profile, we compute reconstructed Ly-alpha\nprofiles for the same grid of T and N(H2 ) values used in \u00a73. Model fluxes at 8 pumping\ntransitions, all on the red wing of the Ly\u03b1 line, are fitted to the observed profile. The observed\nLy\u03b1 flux at other pumping wavelengths is corrupted by interstellar or wind absorption. Two\nprogressions, 3-3 R(2) at 1217.031 \u00c5 and 3-3 P(1) at 1217.038 \u00c5, are not included in the\nfit because their absorption profiles overlap, complicating the analysis. Photoexcitation of\nH2 by C III emission via the transition 3-2 P(4) at 1174.923 \u00c5 may also add flux to the\nprogression pumped by 3-3 R(2). We judge the suitability of a model using a modified \u03c72\nanalysis to measure the scatter in the red wing of the reconstructed profile. Errors in the\nLy\u03b1 line wing tend to be multiplicative, rather than additive, so we define \u03c72Ly\u03b1\n\u03c72Ly\u03b1 =\n\nX Fobs\nFobs 2\n(\nlog\n)\n\u03c3obs\nFmod\n\n(4)\n\nbased on standard error propagation techniques from Bevington (1969). Using this formula,\nan overestimate and an underestimate of the reconstructed Ly\u03b1 profile by a factor of 10 will\nresult in the same contribution to \u03c72Ly\u03b1 .\nFigure 11 shows confidence contours of 1 \u2212 5\u03c3 calculated from \u2206\u03c72\u03bd,Ly\u03b1 for fits to the\nobserved Ly\u03b1 profile, with 5 degrees of freedom. In the thick disk geometry, a minimum\n\u03c72\u03bd,Ly\u03b1 = 2.31 is obtained when comparing the reconstructed and observed Ly\u03b1 profiles for\nlog N(H2 )=18.5, T = 2500 K, and \u03b7 = 0.25. The top panel of Fig. 12 shows that these\nparameters yield an excellent fit to the observed profile. These parameters also reproduce the\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nindividual line fluxes well (see \u00a73 and Fig. 9). Since the confidence contours calculated from\nthe Ly\u03b1 profile analysis place a more stringent constraint on the temperature and column\ndensity than do the contours from fitting individual line fluxes (see Fig. 11), we choose on\nthe values of T and N(H2 ) quoted above as our best estimates of these parameters. The\nmodel dependent quantities listed in Table 2 are all calculated using these parameters.\nMore than 500 other possible upward transitions in the Lyman-band have wavelengths\nbetween 1210\u20131220 \u00c5. Fluorescent emission in lines from these weaker progressions is below\nour detection limit. Table 4 identifies undetected progressions with the largest predicted\nemission line fluxes. The table includes our observational flux limit Fmax on the strongest\nline in the progression at wavelength \u03bbmax . For any H2 line that is not detected and does\nnot appear in Table 4, we place an upper flux limit of 5 \u00d7 10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 . We then use\nthese upper limits to calculate an upper limit of Ly\u03b1 at the pumping wavelength to test the\nself-consistency of our model.\nFigure 12 shows three examples of reconstructed Ly\u03b1 profiles (circles), with upper limits\nto the Ly\u03b1 flux at certain wavelengths calculated from upper limits of lines in the undetected\nprogressions (arrows), as described above. The top panel shows the Ly\u03b1 profile constructed\nusing the parameters for our adopted model [log N(H2 )=18.5, T = 2500 K, and \u03b7 = 0.25].\nThis profile is smooth, and its wings correspond well with the wings of the observed Ly\u03b1\nprofile. The upper limits on the flux of Ly\u03b1 calculated from undetected progressions are\nall consistent with the Ly\u03b1 profile reconstructed from observed progressions. The middle\npanel shows a Ly\u03b1 profile calculated from a model with log N(H2 )=19.0, T = 2000 K, and\n\u03b7 = 0.4, which is inconsistent with the data because of a large amount of scatter in the red\nwing of the reconstructed Ly\u03b1 profile. The bottom plot shows a Ly\u03b1 profile calculated from\na model with log N(H2 )=19.0, T = 3000 K, and \u03b7 = 0.2, which is also inconsistent with the\ndata because at 1214.421 \u00c5 the predicted Ly\u03b1 emission required to pump the v \u2032 = 7, J \u2032 = 4\nlevel is significantly below the observationally constrained flux at 1214.465 \u00c5. Figure 13\nis a reproduction of Figure 11, with dotted and diagonal lines added to show the region\nof parameter space that are excluded because upper limits on H2 emission would imply a\nLy\u03b1 pumping flux significantly lower than the nearby Ly\u03b1 pumping flux for a progression\nof observed H2 lines. Parameter space constraints are shown separately for upper limits on\nprogressions pumped via 7-4 P(5) at 1214.421 \u00c5 alone (dots) and via a set of others upward\ntransitions (diagonal lines). The parameter space with \u03b7 > 1 (dashed lines in Fig. 13) are\nunphysical models, and are also ruled out.\nThe three reconstructed Ly\u03b1 profiles shown in Figure 12 are roughly similar to each\nother and to most other Ly\u03b1 profiles that we have reconstructed for other values of T and\nN(H2 ). Each profile shows a clear depression near Ly\u03b1 line center that is not nearly as\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nwide as the observed H I absorption. Figure 14 demonstrates that the absorption feature in\nthe reconstructed Ly\u03b1 profile can be characterized by a column density log N(H I) \u2248 18.7\ncentered 90 km s\u22121 shortward of line center. This H I between the source of Ly\u03b1 emissio and\nthe warm H2 could be in the base of a wind or at the disk surface. Alternatively, the shape\nof the Ly\u03b1 profile could be an intrinsic self-reversal, in which case the intervening H I need\nnot exist. The blue side of the reconstructed Ly\u03b1 profile is enhanced relative to the observed\nLy\u03b1 profile, because wind absorption in our line of sight to the star attenuates the intrinsic\nemission. This result supports our conclusion from Paper I that, in our line of sight, the H2\nmust be photoexcited interior to most of the wind that we detect.\n\n5.\n\nALTERNATIVE GEOMETRIES\n\nIn \u00a73 and \u00a74, we described in detail results for a dust-free thick disk geometry, which\nmay not represent the true morphology of warm gas around the star. In this section, we\nexplore the same parameter space for a thin disk geometry, shown schematically in Figure\n8, and a cloud geometry, which approximates H2 emission from a cloud in our line of sight\nto the star.\nThe computed H2 fluxes depend on the angle at which Ly\u03b1 photons enter the disk, the\nexit angle of H2 photons, and the extinction either within the disk or in the ISM. Figures\n15 and 16 and Table 5 present the best-fit parameters from fitting the H2 line opacities for\neach of three geometries as a function of the exit angle of H2 and extinction within the disk.\nIn general, while changes in the geometry of the system can mildly change some results, the\ncalculated temperature of the warm gas depends primarily upon the molecular physics and\nnot on the geometry. The calculated column density of H2 and its physical interpretation,\nhowever, do depend on the assumed geometry. In what follows, the column density represents\nthe amount of H2 in a line of sight normal to the disk surface, regardless of the path length\nthe Ly\u03b1 photons traverse through the disk.\n\n5.1.\n\nThin Disk Geometry\n\nA thin disk (see Fig. 8) is characterized here as a disk for which the filling factor of H2\naround the Ly\u03b1 source is dominated by the surface layers of the disk, rather than by the\ninner edge of the disk. We approximate this geometry with a model in which the incident\nLy\u03b1 photons enter a plane-parallel slab at a large angle with respect to the disk normal\nand are reprocessed into H2 photons that emerge normal to the slab. Because Ly\u03b1 photons\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nenter the slab at a large angle, the radiation is reprocessed into H2 emission at a shallow\ndepth, and the emerging H2 photons see a smaller optical depth in this geometry than in\nthe thick disk geometry. For the thin disk geometry, with incident photons entering the disk\nat \u03b8 = 80\u25e6 , the best-fit parameters are T = 2500 K, N(H2 )=20.0, but with an unacceptable\n\u03c72\u03bd,H2 = 7.9, for fits to H2 line fluxes. For fits of the reconstructed to the observed Ly\u03b1 line,\nthe confidence contours move to smaller column densities by a factor of sin \u03b8. As the angle\nof incidence asymptotically approaches 90\u25e6 , the Ly\u03b1 photons are converted into H2 photons\nclose to the disk surface. Since the optical depth traversed by the emitted H2 photons is\nnegligible, the relative line fluxes with each progression differ from predicted branching ratios\nonly because of extinction, which we find to be unlikely (see \u00a72.2 and \u00a75.3).\n\n5.2.\n\nCloud Geometry\n\nWe next consider a geometry in which the H2 is located between us and the source of\nLy\u03b1 photons. In this geometry, the escaping photons must travel through a greater optical\ndepth of H2 than they would in the other geometries that we considered. As a result, the\nacceptable contours for fits to H2 line fluxes move towards smaller column densities relative\nto the thick or thin disk geometries. Even in this very different geometry, the confidence\ncontours for the Ly\u03b1 reconstruction fitting do not move much in parameter space, and they\nrestrict the gas temperature to 2000\u20133000 K. The best-fit parameters in fitting H2 fluxes for\nthis geometry are T = 2600 K, N(H2 )=17.8, with \u03c72\u03bd,H2 = 2.8. The transmission geometry\nis probably not realistic for TW Hya, but it can be used to set limits on the column of warm\nH2 between us and the source of Ly\u03b1 emission. The absence of any observed H2 absorption\nin the Ly\u03b1 profile (Fig. 3) allows us to place a limit on the column density in this level of\nlog N(v \u2032\u2032 = 2, J \u2032\u2032 = 1) < 14.4 and a total column density of warm H2 of log N(H2 ) < 16.1.\nThus, the detected H2 fluorescence does not occur in our line of sight to TW Hya.\n\n5.3.\n\nDust Extinction in the Disk and the ISM\n\nIn \u00a72, we presented evidence that the dust extinction along our line of sight to the Ly\u03b1\nemission source is negligible. Extinction of H2 emission could occur within the disk if dust\nis mixed with the warm gas, although Calvet et al. (2002) found that small dust grains\nare underabundant within 5 AU of the star. We assume an interstellar extinction law from\nCardelli et al. (1989), for grains typical of the interstellar medium (RV = 3.09).\nFor each H2 progression, the average depth dabs of the initial Ly\u03b1 absorption depends\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\non the opacity of the lower level of H2 (see Fig. 17 and Table 2). If a Ly\u03b1 photon is, on\naverage, absorbed close to the disk surface, then the H2 lines excited by that photon will\nnot be significantly attenuated by any disk extinction. Thus, the extinction varies for the\ndifferent progressions. In Figure 16, AV represents the extinction through half of the slab\n(not the extinction through the entire slab or the extinction from the star to the observer),\nwhich is equal to the largest possible average extinction of H2 emission when Ly\u03b1 photons are\nabsorbed uniformly throughout the slab. Disk extinction attenuates both the incident Ly\u03b1\nemission and the outgoing H2 emission, but not the observed Ly\u03b1 emission, and thus increases\nthe already large filling factor. In the context of our model, significant disk extinction can\nbe ruled out because the computed filling factors would be much larger than unity.\nInterstellar extinction affects the fluxes smoothly across the wavelength region, and does\nnot significantly impact the derived filling factor because it attenuates both the observed Ly\u03b1\nemission and the H2 emission. If we consider only extinction and ignore opacity in the H2\nlines, then from fitting H2 line fluxes we obtain a minimum \u03c72\u03bd,H2 = 6.06 at AV =1.3, which\nis significantly larger than the \u03c72\u03bd,H2 for the best-fitting models.\n\n5.4.\n\nAdoption of the Thick Disk Geometry\n\nBased on these results, and the results presented in Figs. 15-16 and Table 5, we adopt\nthe thick disk geometry (Geometry 2 in Table 5) as the preferred geometry to describe the\nH2 emission. The thick disk geometry is physically plausible and produces reasonably good\nfits with self-consistent results, although certain other geometries can produce lower values\nof \u03c72 in fits to H2 fluxes or in the Ly\u03b1 fits. Some of those geometries (e.g., Geomteries 7\nand 8 from Table 5) represent morphologies that are difficult to reconcile with our previous\nconclusion that the H2 emission occurs in a disk. In other geometries (e.g., Geometries 1\nand 11 from Table 5), contours from the H2 flux fitting do not overlap with the contours\nfrom the Ly\u03b1 fitting as well as they do for the thick disk geometry, i.e. the joint probability\nis lower (see Fig. 11).\nWe caution the reader that the thick disk geometry is best only in the context of our\nrestricted set of models. Warm H2 in the TW Hya star-disk system could in principle have\na morphology not considered here.\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n6.\n6.1.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nSynthesizing the H2 and Ly\u03b1 modelling results\n\nFigures 11 and 13, and Table 5, compare results from our analysis of individual H2 line\nfluxes with our results from the Ly\u03b1 profile reconstruction. Based on the overlap region of\nacceptable models for both the individual H2 line fluxes and the reconstructed Ly\u03b1 profile,\nwe conclude that a column density of log N(H2 ) = 18.5+1.2\n\u22120.8 is heated to a temperature of\n+700\n2500\u2212500 K, with a filling factor of \u03b7 = 0.25 \u00b1 0.08 around TW Hya (2\u03c3 error bars). Table 2\nlists the percentage Pdis of H2 that dissociates from the upper level, the H2 dissociation rate\nin terms of mass (Mdis ), and the total flux for each progression (Fmod ) for our best-fit model\nof log N(H2 ) = 18.5 and T = 2500 K. The notion of a single temperature is a simplistic\nassumption, but it is sufficient to reproduce our data. The temperature derived here is\nwarmer than the \u223c 1100 \u2212 1300 K temperatures seen in the fundamental CO emission by\nNajita et al. (2003).\nThe mass column corresponding to log N(H2 )=18.5 is 10\u22125 g cm\u22122 , which is about 10\u22127\ntimes smaller than the mass column predicted to be within 1 AU by D'Alessio et al. (1999).\nThis suggests that H2 fluorescence probably occurs in a very shallow surface layer of the disk,\nwhich could be a warm, extended disk atmosphere. The Ly\u03b1 fluorescence process cannot be\nused to detect cold H2 , which most likely represents the bulk of the mass in the disk.\nIn our models, we assume that H2 gas is thermalized, so that relative level populations\ndepend only on temperature. This is reasonable because the gas density at the disk surface\nshould be between nH = 106 \u2212 108 cm\u22123 (Gomez & D'Alessio 2000), which is far larger than\nthe critical density of nH =104 cm\u22123 at which collisions typically dominate over quadrupole\nradiative de-excitation. Below the critical density, collisions cannot repopulate excited H2\nlevels as fast as they radiatively deexcite. Fluorescent progressions pumped out of higher\nenergy states would be weaker than expected from our thermal models, generating scatter\nthat we do not see in our reconstructed Ly\u03b1 profile. This conclusion confirms the assumption\nof thermally excited H2 gas used by Black & van Dishoeck (1987) and Burton et al. (1990)\nto model H2 fluorescence.\n\n6.1.1. Filling factor of H2 around the Ly\u03b1 source\nFigure 13 shows that the filling factor of the H2 around the Ly\u03b1 emitting region is\n\u03b7 = 0.25 \u00b1 0.08. This factor represents the solid angle of the sky subtended by H2 as\nseen from the source of Ly\u03b1 photons near TW Hya, although other geometrical effects may\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\ncontribute. Neutral hydrogen mixed with the warm H2 could scatter Ly\u03b1 photons, increasing\nthe effective path length of the Ly\u03b1 photons and thereby reducing the calculated filling factor.\nAny directional dependence of the Ly\u03b1 emission, and the percentage of Ly\u03b1 emission visible\nto us versus the percentage visible to the warm H2 , will also affect the calculated filling\nfactor. A total of 1-2% of the intrinsic Ly\u03b1 emission is reprocessed into H2 emission (see\nTable 6 and \u00a74), which places a lower limit of 0.01 on the filling factor.\nFor any flared disk geometry, the filling factor can be converted into a disk height by\ncomparing the surface areas of a cylinder and a sphere. For \u03b7 = 0.25, the implied geometrical\ndisk height from the midplane to the surface at distance R from the center of the star is\nR\nH=0.25( 1AU\n) AU, compared with predicted disk heights from (D'Alessio 2001) of about\n0.15 AU at a distance of 1 AU from the star.\n\n6.1.2. Relationship between UV and IR H2 Emission\nEmission in the 1-0 S(1) rovibrational transition at 2.1218 \u03bcm has been detected from\n4 T Tauri stars (Bary et al. 2003). The narrow width and absence of any velocity shift with\nrespect to the stars suggests a disk origin of this emission. The flux in this line from an\noptically thin emission region\nN(1, 3)\u03c0r 2 Aul hc\n,\n(5)\nF =\n4\u03c0d2\n\u03bb\nwhere N(1, 3) is the H2 column density of the disk in the v \u2032\u2032 = 1, J \u2032\u2032 = 3 level, \u03c0r 2 is the\nprojected surface area of the emission region, and Aul = 3.47 \u00d7 10\u22127 s\u22121 . If the 1-0 S(1) line\nflux of 1 \u00d7 10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 measured by Weintraub et al. (2000) comes from a heated\ndisk surface layer with N(H2)=18.5 and T=2500 K, then the 1-0 S(1) emission must extend\nout to at least 5 AU for a face-on disk. This corresponds to an angular extent of \u00b10.\u2032\u2032 1,\nwhich could have been resolved in our HST observations, but was not. Thus, it seems likely\nthat at least some of the 1-0 S(1) emission comes from H2 gas that is not fluoresced by Ly\u03b1.\nSome of the emission in the 1-0 S(1) line may be produced deeper in the disk or farther\nfrom the star, as a result of X-ray ionization and subsequent collisional excitation of H2 by\nnon-thermal electrons (Weintraub et al. 2000).\n\n6.1.3. H2 Dissociation Rate\nFrom the flux in observed transitions, we calculate a dissociation rate of 9.8 \u00d7 10\u221211\nM\u2299 yr\u22121 for H2 in the disk. Forward modelling of undetected Lyman and Werner-band\ntransitions excited by Ly\u03b1 photons increases the calculated dissociation rate to 1.6\u00d710\u221210 M\u2299\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nyr\u22121 . Depending on the timescale for collisional de-excitation of H2 , the actual dissociation\nrate could be much higher due to multiple pumping [pumping from lower rovibrational levels\nof H2 that are populated by the initial pump and subsequent fluorescence \u2013 see Shull (1978)\nfor details], which can populate highly excited rovibrational levels in the B electronic state\nthat have dissociation probabilities as high as 50%.\nThe H2 dissociation rate we estimate is within a factor of 10 of TW Hya's mass accretion\nrate (see \u00a72.1), meaning that the dissociation provided by Ly\u03b1 fluorescence may be an\nimportant process in the accretion of hydrogen onto the star. The neutral H released by\ndissociation will cause the incident Ly\u03b1 to scatter, increasing the probability of absorption\nin the pumping transitions and therefore decreasing the required filling factor. The neutral\nH could also be sufficiently optically thick to produce the self-reversal of the Ly\u03b1 profile that\nirradiates the disk (see Fig. 14).\n\n6.2.\n\nFUV radiation field\n\nThe FUV radiation field incident on the accretion disk can significantly affect the chemistry and temperature structure of the disk. In Table 6 we list the flux for spectral features in\nthe FUV spectrum of TW Hya. The observed Ly\u03b1 line contributes 67% of the observed FUV\nflux of 6.5 \u00d7 10\u221211 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 between 1170\u20131700 \u00c5. From the reconstructed Ly\u03b1 profile,\nwe infer an intrinsic flux of 8 \u2212 16 \u00d7 10\u221211 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 , depending on the correction for\nthe central absorption. With this correction, Ly\u03b1 emission contributes 80\u201390% of the FUV\nflux of TW Hya, of which 1-2% is reprocessed into H2 emission. The continuum accounts for\nabout 6 \u00d7 10\u221212 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 , or about 4% of the total emission, including the estimated\nintrinsic Ly\u03b1 flux. The remaining flux occurs in other emission lines such as the C IV 1550 \u00c5\ndoublet. The UV flux below 1170 \u00c5 measured by FUSE adds at most 2% additional flux to\nthe strength of the radiation field. The UV radiation between 1700\u20132000 \u00c5 may add to the\nradiation field, primarily due to emission in lines such as Si II] \u03bb1817 and C III] \u03bb1909, but\nwill have little effect on the excitation of molecules and atoms in the disk. The estimated\ntotal emission after including Ly\u03b1 flux that is not observable is approximately 10\u22123 L\u2299 ,\nassuming isotropic emission and a distance of 56 pc.\nThe properties of the disk, both in the PDR-like disk atmosphere and in the cooler outer\nregions, will be partially controlled by the Ly\u03b1 emission, as evidenced by the fluorescent H2\nemission. Not only does Ly\u03b1 dominate the FUV flux of TW Hya, but it can also scatter\noff neutral H towards the interior of the disk, allowing it to penetrate the disk further than\ncontinuum UV radiation. Ly\u03b1 can dissociate molecules such as H2 and H2 O, and can ionize\nSi and C. Bergin et al. (2003) explain that the enhancement of CN relative to HCN occurs\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nin disks because Ly\u03b1 radiation can photodissociate HCN, whereas CN can be dissociated\nonly by radiation with \u03bb < 1150 \u00c5.\n\n6.3.\n\nHeating mechanisms\n\nWe have found evidence for a warm surface layer of H2 on the disk around TW Hya.\nFrom the lack of spatial extent in the STIS echelle cross-dispersion direction, the heated\nsurface is located within 2 AU of the star. Models of dust in disks of CTTSs typically\npredict T \u2248 1000 K only within 0.1 AU of the star (D'Alessio et al. 2001; Chiang & Goldreich\n1997). The FUV radiation field at 1 AU from the star is approximately 107 G0 , where the\nHabing field G0 = 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22123 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (the local interstellar field is 1.7 G0 ), which is\nstronger than the FUV radiation field incident upon most PDRs (103 \u2212 106 G0 ). Hollenbach,\nYorke & Johnstone (2000) predicted from models of photo-dissociation regions that a warm\natmosphere-like structure, heated by UV radiation, should surround the inner regions of a\ndisk, with a temperature between 500 and 3000 K.\nBecause of the absence of micron-sized dust grains within 5 AU of TW Hya (Calvet et\nal. 2002), a large percentage of the FUV radiation may be deposited into the gas. In their\nanalysis of the H2 fluorescence from Mira B, Wood et al. (2002) found that the temperature\nincreases sharply with radius from the UV source, and that the Ly\u03b1 fluorescence process is\na significant heating source for the gas. The energy deposited into the warm gas near TW\nHya due to Ly\u03b1 photoexcitation and subsequent fluorescence is 1.4 \u00d7 1029 erg s\u22121 , which\ncorresponds to roughly 0.01 eV s\u22121 per molecule of H2 . The strong X-ray luminosity of TW\nHya, LX = 3.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 L\u2299 between 0.45\u20136.0 keV (Kastner et al. 2002), could heat the disk\nsurfaces by an additional 500 K (Igea & Glassgold 1999; Glassgold & Najita 2001; Fromang\net al. 2002) by ionizing atoms to produce a large reservoir of energetic non-thermal electrons\n(e.g., Maloney et al. 1996; Yan & Dalgarno 1997). X-rays can also penetrate deeper into\nthe gas than UV radiation and, consequently, may heat gas deeper in the disk than the UV\nradiation.\nCertain observed fluorescence progressions are pumped from lower rovibrational levels\nwith large energies, such as v \u2032\u2032 = 3, J \u2032\u2032 = 25 (E \u2032\u2032 = 4.2 eV) and v \u2032\u2032 = 5, J \u2032\u2032 = 18 (E \u2032\u2032 = 3.8\neV). The measured flux in these progressions, comibed with the observed flux at the pumping\nwavelengths, requires that of order 1% of the H2 resides in these levels. This population is\ntoo large to be thermally populated at any reasonable temperature for the H2 gas. Therefore,\nnon-thermal processes must be populating these levels. Although the fluorescence process can\npopulate high vibrational levels in the ground electronic state, fluorescence cannot directly\npopulate high rotational levels, and no direct paths exist to the levels v \u2032\u2032 = 3, J \u2032\u2032 = 25 and\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nv \u2032\u2032 = 5, J \u2032\u2032 = 18. H2 can form in highly excited states (Kokoouline, Greene, & Esry 2001;\nStrasser et al. 2001) via dissociative recombination of H+\n3 . Given a dense medium and a\n+\nlarge ionizing flux, then H2 may be present in large enough quantities to react with H2 to\n+\nproduce H+\n3 in highly excited states. More attempts to detect H3 would be useful.\n\n7.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe have modeled a plane-parallel slab of warm H2 (see Fig. 1), which represents the\nsurface of a protoplanetary disk irradiated by UV flux from the star. Our analysis of the\nultraviolet spectrum of TW Hya obtained with the STIS instrument on HST and with FUSE\nleads to the following conclusions:\n1. The FUV continuum rises shortward of 1700 \u00c5, which is indicative of an H2 dissociation continuum, although it could also be produced by H2 fluorescence due to FUV\ncontinuum pumping or an additional accretion or activity component. The FUV continuum\nis not well explained by simple models of a pure hydrogen slab, which are commonly invoked\nto analyze the excess NUV continuum.\n2. The extinction towards TW Hya is negligible, based on the hydrogen column density\nin our line of sight and assuming an interstellar gas-to-dust ratio.\n3. Self-absorption of Lyman-band transitions involving low excitation energy levels\nweakens the flux in these lines. We model this effect by simulating Ly\u03b1 emission entering a\nplane-parallel atmosphere and pumping the H2 .\n4. Using the observed H2 fluxes and our fluorescence models, we reconstruct the Ly\u03b1\nline profile incident upon the warm molecular layer and compare it to the observed Ly\u03b1\nprofile, for a range of assumed temperatures and column densities. Undetected progressions\nrule out a large region of parameter space in this model. The reconstructed Ly\u03b1 profile is\nsimilar to the observed profile in the wings, but shows a much narrower absorption feature\nthan is observed. This narrow absorption component in the reconstructed profile could be a\nself-reversal or a component of the wind between the source of Ly\u03b1 emission and the warm\nmolecular region.\n5. Our models indicate that a molecular layer with a kinetic temperature of 2500+700\n\u2212500\nK and a column density of log N(H2 ) = 18.5+1.2\n(2\u03c3\nerror\nbars)\nabsorbs\nLy\u03b1\nradiation\n\u22120.8\nin the surface layer and inner edge of the disk within 2 AU of the central star. The Ly\u03b1\npumping leads to a small H2 dissociation rate and does not cause significant disk dissipation.\nThe filling factor of the warm H2 around TW Hya is \u03b7 = 0.25 \u00b1 0.08, although significant\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nuncertainties in the geometry of the fluorescent H2 weaken our confidence in the large filling\nfactor.\n6. The warm H2 most likely resides in a warm surface layer of the disk. This surface\nlayer may be analgous to a classic PDR, although in this case the FUV radiation field is\ndominated by emission lines rather than a continuum. In particular, Ly\u03b1 comprises about\n85% of the FUV radiation field below 2000 \u00c5, and it controls the excitation and ionization\nof the disk surface.\n7. Some of the observed H2 lines are pumped from high rotational levels that cannot\nbe excited thermally or by fluorescence. Formation of rotationally excited H2 by reactions\nwith H+\n3 may explain these emission lines.\nThis research is supported by NASA grant S-56500-D to the University of Colorado\nand NIST, and by a grant to the University of Colorado of NASA funds through the Johns\nHopkins University.

FUV\nradiation, primarily Ly\u03b1, is produced at the accretion shock and heats the disk. The warm\nH2 is located in surface layers of the disk within 2 AU of the star. The hot surface of the\ndisk, composed of atoms and ions, probably extends inwards to about 6R\u2217 (Johns-Krull &\nValenti 2001b), where it is truncated by the stellar magnetosphere.\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\n\nFig. 2.- The solid line shows the observed spectrum of of TW Hya, after subtracting the\ntemplate spectrum of V819 Tau. The dashed line shows the synthetic spectrum of a pure\nhydrogen slab fit to the observed Balmer jump and the Balmer lines. The pure hydrogen\ncontinuum accurately approximates the NUV continuum of TW Hya but significantly underestimates the FUV continuum. The rise of the FUV continuum shortward of 1700 \u00c5 is\nindicative of an H2 dissociation continuum produced by collisions with energetic electrons,\nalthough it could also be produced by H2 fluorescence due to FUV pumping or an additional\naccretion or activity component.\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- The Ly\u03b1 emission from TW Hya is partially absorbed by H I in the line of sight\nto TW Hya. The interstellar and circumstellar media, centered at about 0 km s\u22121 , account\nfor the red side of the absorption. The blue side of the absporption is produced by H I in\nthe wind. The dashed line shows our best fit to the observed Ly\u03b1 profile (solid line) using\ntwo Gaussian emission profiles to model the intrinsic Ly\u03b1 line before the absorption, while\nthe dotted and dashed-dotted lines assume different H I column densities that poorly fit the\nred side of the observed profile.\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- The transmission percentage across the observed Ly\u03b1 profile (solid) for column\ndensities log N(H)= 19.75 (dashed) and log N(H)= 20.5 (dotted), assuming no Doppler\nbroadening. This assumption places a strong upper limit of N(H I< 19.75) towards TW\nHya.\n\n\f\u2013 31 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.- The O VI emission line from TW Hya (solid), as observed with the LiF1a detector\non FUSE. We place a limit of N(H2 )< 18 in our line of sight towards TW Hya by comparing\nthe observed emission with the simulated transmission percentage given the resolution of\nFUSE, through a medium of H2 with T = 100 K and N(H2 )=17.5 (dashed) and N(H2 )=19.0\n(dotted). We would observe many H2 absorption lines against the O VI emission from TW\nHya for hotter excitation temperatures of H2 .\n\n\f\u2013 32 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.- The NUV continuum (solid) is well fit by the accretion model (dashed) for AV = 0.0,\nbut if AV = 0.5, the rise in the continuum below 2600 \u00c5 is not fit well.\n\n\f\u2013 33 \u2013\n\nFig. 7.- For four different upper levels, we plot the normalized ratio of the observed deexcitations in each H2 line divided by the respective branching ratio (circles). The squares\nshow the fluxes prediced based on the optical depth in each lower level for our adopted model\nfor log N(H2 ) = 18.5 and T = 2500 K (see \u00a75). The dotted and dashed lines show extinction\ncurves for AV = 0.5 and 1.5, respectively. Emission in an optically thin medium, with no\nintervening extinction, would result in ratios of 1.0. The apparent wavelength dependence\nresults from the larger optical depth in those levels of H2 which have lower excitation energies.\nThe H2 line fluxes from v \u2032 =4, J \u2032 =18 show no wavelength dependence because the observed\nlines all have lower levels with energies large enough that they are not populated.\n\n\f\u2013 34 \u2013\n\nFig. 8.- Two plausible geometries for H2 fluorescence in the surface layers of a protoplanetary disk. The Ly\u03b1 enters the surface layer of H2 at angle \u03b8 with respect to the normal and\nis reprocessed into H2 emission, which escapes the disk at angle \u03c6.\n\n\f\u2013 35 \u2013\n\nFig. 9.- 1 \u2212 5\u03c3 confidence contours calculated from \u2206\u03c72\u03bd,H2 for fits to the individual H2 line\nfluxes for the thick disk model (see \u00a73). The star indicates the position of the model with\nT = 2500 K and log N(H2 )=18.5 (see \u00a76).\n\n\f\u2013 36 \u2013\n\nFig. 10.- Selected regions of the HST /STIS spectrum of TW Hya. The narrow features\nare all H2 lines. The dashed lines show our model fit to the H2 emission. The line at 1333.8\n\u00c5 is supressed by C II in the wind of TW Hya, which places the H2 interior to the wind.\n\n\f\u2013 37 \u2013\n\nFig. 11.- 1 \u2212 5\u03c3 confidence contours calculate from \u2206\u03c72\u03bd,Ly\u03b1 (shaded regions) for our fit of\nthe reconstructed Ly\u03b1 profile to the red wing of the observed Ly\u03b1 profile, compared with\n1 \u2212 5\u03c3 confidence contours (solid lines) for fits to the observed H2 fluxes.\n\n\f\u2013 38 \u2013\n\nFig. 12.- Comparison of the observed (solid line) and calculated (circles) Ly\u03b1 emission\nprofiles, for models with (top) log N(H2 )=18.5, T = 2500 K, and \u03b7 = 0.25 (middle)\nlog N(H2 )=19.0 T = 2000 K, and \u03b7 = 0.41; and (bottom) log N(H2 )=19.0 T = 3000 K,\nand \u03b7 = 0.20. The arrows show upper limits to the calculated Ly\u03b1 emission based on undetected H2 progressions. The top plot is the best fit because of the least scatter in the red\nwing of Ly\u03b1. The bottom model is unacceptable because several undetected progressions\n(v \u2032 = 7, J \u2032 = 4 pumped at 1214.4 \u00c5 and v \u2032 = 5, J \u2032 = 20 pumped at 1217.7 \u00c5) imply upper limits of Ly\u03b1 flux that are significantly lower than the flux reconstructed from nearby\ndetected progressions.\n\n\f\u2013 39 \u2013\n\nFig. 13.- Similar contours as in Figure 11. The dots indicate the parameter space that we\nrule out because those parameters predict that lines pumped by 7-4 P(5) should be observed,\nand the diagonal lines indicate the parameter space ruled out because many additional other\nprogressions should be observed but are not detected. Filling factor contours (dashed lines)\nof 0.125\u20134.0 are also shown. A filling factor above 1 is unphysical. The three models with\nreconstructed Ly\u03b1 profiles in Fig. 13 are shown as asterisks.\n\n\f\u2013 40 \u2013\n\nFig. 14.- The reconstructed Ly\u03b1 profile at the wavelengths of the pumping transitions\n(diamonds) for T = 2500 K, log N(H2 )=18.5, and \u03b7 = 0.25 corresponds well to a plausible\nLy\u03b1 profile (dashed line), constructed using a single Gaussian profile (dotted line) and an\nabsorption feature of log N(H I)= 18.7 blueshifted 90 km s\u22121 from line center.\n\n\f\u2013 41 \u2013\n\nFig. 15.- Best-fit models to H2 fluxes as a function of exit angle \u03c6 of H2 photons, for\nthe thick disk geometry (solid line), thin disk geometry (dashed line), and cloud geometry\n(dotted line).\n\n\f\u2013 42 \u2013\n\nFig. 16.- Best-fit models to H2 fluxes as a function of extinction within the H2 slab, for\nthe thick disk geometry (solid line), thin disk geometry (dashed line), and cloud geometry\n(dotted line). The extinction is for a progression in which the average Ly\u03b1 photon is absorbed\nat the midplane of the slab.\n\n\f\u2013 43 \u2013\n\nFig. 17.- The percent of the slab depth that a Ly\u03b1 photon excites H2 to two different upper\nlevels (absorption depth dabs in Table 2), at two temperatures. As the column density and\ntemperature of the slab increase, the optical depth in the lower levels increase, and a typical\nLy\u03b1 photon is reprocessed into H2 at a shallower depth. This transition occurs at different\ncolumn densities and temperatures for each progression, so that the reconstruction of the\nLy\u03b1 profile is sensitive to these parameters.\n\n\f\u2013 44
