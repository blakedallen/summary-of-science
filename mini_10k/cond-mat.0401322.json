Front propagation usually emerges when\na local reaction dynamics interplays with diffusion in space\nof the reacting agents and has been observed in a wide range\nof physical, chemical and biological systems [1]. Prominent\nexamples are patterns of bacterial colonies [2], spreading phenomena in population genetics [3, 4] and interface dynamics\nin superconducters [5]. One of the most prominent models\nwhich displays propagating fronts is the Fisher-KolmogorovPetrovsky-Piscounov (FKPP) equation for the spatial concentration u(x, t) of a reacting agent,\n\u2202t u = \u03b3 u (1 \u2212 u) + \u2206u,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere diffusive motion of the reacting agents is assumed.\nHowever, this assumption cannot be justified for a number of\nsystems. In fact, superdiffusive dispersion in space has been\nobserved in a wide range of physical and biological systems,\ne.g. intermittent chaotic systems [6], bacterial motion [7], and\nforaging patterns of albatrosses [8].\nSuperdiffusive stochastic motion is usually characterized\nby a lack of scale in the microscopic single step distribution.\nOne of the most successful theoretical concepts devised for\nthe understanding of superdiffusion is a class of random walks\nknown as L\u00e9vy flights [9]. A L\u00e9vy flight consists of random\nsingle steps \u2206x which are drawn from an inverse power-law\npdf (probability density function) p(\u2206x) \u223c |\u2206x|\u2212(1+\u03bc) characterized by a L\u00e9vy exponent 0 < \u03bc < 2. Due to the heavy\ntail, the variance in step size is divergent, the process lacks\na spatial scale and the position X(t) of a L\u00e9vy flight scales\nheuristically with time t as X(t) \u223c t1/\u03bc . The associated\ndiffusion equations contain fractional generalizations of ordinary derivatives [10, 11]. These fractional Fokker-Planck\nequations can exhibit behaviors strikingly different from ordinary ones [12] and have found wide application in physics,\ne.g. protein motion on folded hetero-polymers [13] and the\ndynamics of modern epidemics [14, 15].\nIn two recent studies wave front dynamics was shown to be\ndrastically different from ordinary reaction-diffusion dynamics when the reacting agents move superdiffusively [16, 17].\nThe authors considered fractional generalizations of Eq. (1)\n\nand showed that the spatio-temporal shape u(x, t) of the leading egde of a propagating front has a power-law tail along\nthe spatial coordinate and accelerates exponentially in time\nas opposed to the constant velocity and exponential decay in\nspace exhibited by ordinarily diffusive system. The predictions made by mean field theory thus indicate that scale-free,\nsuperdiffusive dispersion of the reacting agents excludes constant velocity wave fronts and induces an entirely different\nspatio-temporal behavior.\nHowever, as has been shown in a number of recent studies,\nthe effect of fluctuations can be rather profound in these systems [18, 19, 20]. For instance, fluctuations can destabilize\nhomogeneous wave fronts in two-dimensional systems [21].\nA finite albeit large number N of particles or reacting agents\nleads to a multiplicative noise term in the reaction-diffusion\nequations and although the variance of the noise is of order\n1/N , corrections to macroscopic quantities such as the front\nspeed v scale as (log N )\u22122 , a significant correction to the\nmean field approximation even for very large values of N .\nBrunet and Derrida [22, 23] extended mean field dynamics by\nan effective cutoff parameter \u03b5 for the concentration of particles below which no reaction and hence no exponential growth\nof the leading edge of a front is possible. Despite the fact that\na rigorous equivalence with multiplicative noise is still lacking, the effective cutoff approach is very intuitive and in remarkable agreement with simulations of the full probabilistic\ndynamics.\nHere, we focus on the effect of fluctuations on reactionsuperdiffusion kinetics. We show that for arbitrarily small\nfluctuations (i.e. arbitrarily large particle numbers N ), wave\nfronts propagate asymptotically at constant velocities. Furthermore, we show that as soon as fluctuations enter the description the algebraic tail along the spatial coordinate of the\nleading edge disappears and is replaced by an exponential decay. Thus, despite the fact that reacting agents move superdiffusively in space, the wave front patterns are qualitatively the\nsame as in the ordinary diffusion case. We show that a front\nspeed v is selected after a transient time and that v scales with\nparticle number as v \u223c N 1/\u03bc for L\u00e9vy exponents \u03bc < 2.\nThe results reported here are rather counterintuitive, deviate\nstrongly from the predictions cast by mean field theory, and\nindicate that fluctuations affect reactions-superdiffusion sys-\n\n\f2\nof size \u03a9 around x of type A and B, respectively. The volume\n\u03a9 is assumed to be large enough to contain a large number\nof particles but small compared to the spatial extend of the\nsystem. The total number of particles in \u03a9 around x is given\nby N (x, t) = nA (x, t) + nB (x, t). Without spatial dispersion of particles the local dynamics is governed by the master\nequation\nX\n\u2202t p(n, t) =\nw(n|m)p(m, t) \u2212 w(m|n)p(n, t)\n(4)\nm\n\nfor the probability p(n, t) of finding a number n = nA\nof particles of type A at a location x with initial condition\np(n, 0) = \u03b4(n \u2212 n0 ) and the rate\nw(n|m) =\n\nk1\nk2\nm(N\u2212m)\u03b4n,m+1 + m(N\u2212m)\u03b4n,m\u22121 .

Note that hn(t)i is continuous in [0, N ]. In\na spatially extended system the number of particles is a function of position, i.e. n = n(x, t). Apart from normalization,\nhn(x, t)i may be interpreted as the probability of finding an A\nparticle in the volume \u03a9. Dispersion contributes to the change\nof particles \u2202t hn(x)i according to\nZ\n\u2202t hn(x, t)i = dy f (|x \u2212 y|) [hn(y, t)i \u2212 hn(x, t)i] , (7)\nincorporating the probability density rate (Eq. (3)) of jumping from y to x. Eq. (7) defines the operator L acting on the\nfield hn(x, t)i. Denoting the spatial density of particles by\nu(x, t) = n(x, t)/\u03a9 and combining Eq. (6) with (7) yields\n\u2202t hui = \u03b3 hu (1 \u2212 u)i + L hui ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere we have set without loss of generally the maximum\ndensity N/\u03a9 to unity.\nWhen particles perform ordinary random walks, i.e. if the\njump rate f (|x \u2212 y|) is equipped with a length scale \u03c3, the\noperator L can be approximated by the ordinary Laplacian \u2206\non scales larger than \u03c3. However, this description is no longer\nvalid if f (x) \u223c |x|\u2212(1+\u03bc) with 0 < \u03bc < 2. In this case\nindividual jumps lack a scale, particle perform L\u00e9vy flights,\nand L is proportional to a non-local singular integral operator,\n\n(3)\n\nParticles of type A and B either react to produce two particles of type A or two particles of type B at rate k1 and k2 ,\nrespectively. Furthermore, particles of both types may jump\nfrom position x to position y with a probability density rate\nf (|x \u2212 y|) which we assume to be a decreasing function of\ndistance |x \u2212 y|. The dynamic stochastic variables are the particle numbers nA (x, t) and nB (x, t) of particles in an volume\n\n(6)\n\n\u2206\u03bc/2 u(x, t) = C\u03bc\n\nZ\n\ndy\n\n[u(y, t) \u2212 u(x, t)]\n.\n|x \u2212 y|1+\u03bc\n\n(9)\n\nwhere C\u03bc is a constant [24]. In Fourier space the operator\n\u2206\u03bc/2 is equivalent to a multiplication by |k|\u03bc , generalizing the\nwell known k 2 factor corresponding to the ordinary Laplacian\nwhich is why \u2206\u03bc/2 is frequently referred to as a fractional\nLaplacian.\n\n\f3\n\nFigure 2: Scaling behavior of the fronts profiles at exponentially increasing times t as in Fig. 1 in the reference frame of the front. Arrows indicate the temporal direction. The curves approach a steady\nstate characterized by an exponential decay in space, exp \u2212\u03bbx. The\nposition of the from x\u2217 (t) is given by u(x\u2217 (t), t) = 0.05 . Other\nparameters are as in Fig. 1.\n2\n\nSince u2 > hui one cannot computed the dynamics\nof hn(x, t)i from Eq. (8) alone. The crudest approximation\nis the mean field approach in which fluctuations are ignored\n2\n( u2 \u2248 hui and thus u = hui) and Eq. (8) reads\n\u2202t u = \u03b3 u (1 \u2212 u) + \u2206\u03bc/2 u,\n\n(10)\n\nwhich is the Fisher-equation (1) for \u03bc = 2 and its superdiffusive mean field generalization for \u03bc < 2.\nThe next better step is to account for fluctuations (N \u226b 1)\nwhich leads to an additional multiplicative white noise term\nof variance u(1 \u2212 u)/N in Eq. (10). Alternatively one may\nincorporate the finite particle number as an effective cutoff\n\u03b5 \u223c 1/N in the logistic growth term retaining a deterministic\nequation, i.e.\n\u2202t u = \u03b3 u (1 \u2212 u)\u0398(u \u2212 \u03b5) + \u2206\u03bc/2 u,\n\n(11)\n\nin which \u0398 is the Heaviside-function. Qualitatively, this accounts for the fact that no growth on average can occur if the\nparticle concentrations u is less than one particle per unit volume. This approach has been applied successfully in the ordinary diffusion scenario [22]. In Eq. (11), mean field theory\nimplies \u03b5 = 0.\nIn the following we investigate front dynamics of the system defined by Eq. (11) and compare its properties to the mean\nfield dynamics (\u03b5 = 0) , the limiting case of ordinary diffusion\n(\u03bc = 2) and the dynamics of the full probabilistic dynamics\n(Eqs. (2) and (3)).\nFig. 1 depicts front dynamics obtained from numerical integration of (11) for a concentration u(x, t) initially peaked at\nthe origin. For various particle numbers N the velocity and\nshape of the front were computed. Fig. 1(a) shows that even\nfor very large particle numbers wave fronts move asymptotically at constant speeds, a remarkable difference from the\nmean field limit (dashed line in the inset) which predicts exponentially accelerating front. Fig. 1(b) depicts snapshots of\n\nthe wavefronts on a double-logarithmic scale. After a transient phase, the shape of the front approaches a steady state\nwith a sharply decreasing boundary at intermediate values for\nthe concentration and an algebraic tail for large x with concentrations u(x, t) below the cutoff \u03b5. Fig. 2 displays the\nsteady state front shape on a semilogarithmic scale. As opposed to the algebraic tail predicted by mean field theory,\nthe boundary is an exponential function of relative position\nz = x \u2212 vt, i.e. u(z) \u223c exp \u2212\u03bbz, characterized by a spatial scale \u03bb. In summary, the characteristic spatio-temporal\nwave front solution of Eq. (11) for large times is given by\nu(x, t) \u223c exp [\u2212\u03bb(x \u2212 vt)] , for 1/N < u < 1 followed by a\npower-law tail u(x, t) \u223c (x \u2212 vt)\u2212(1+\u03bc) for u < 1/N . The\ndecay parameter \u03bb and the velocity v depend on the particle\nnumber N . Qualitatively, the this dependence can be determined in the moving reference frame under the assumption\nthat u(x, t) = u(x \u2212 vt) = u(z). Figs. 1(b) and 2 suggest\nthat u(z) = u1 (z) = exp \u2212\u03bbz for z < z \u22c6 and \u03b5 < u \u226a 1\nand u(z) = u2 (z) = A/z 1+\u03bc for z > z \u22c6 (u < \u03b5) where z \u22c6\nmarks the crossover between exponential and algebraic decay.\nInserted into Eq. (11) yields\nv\u03bbu1 \u2248 u1 + \u2206\u03bc/2 u\nz < z\u22c6\n\u2212v u\u20322 = \u2206\u03bc/2 u\nz > z \u22c6.\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\nNear the crossover the values of the dispersion in both equations are approximately the same, i.e. (\u2206\u03bc/2 u)(z \u22c6 \u2212 \u2206z) \u2248\n(\u2206\u03bc/2 u)(z \u22c6 + \u2206z) and both equations can be combined to\nv\u03bbu1 \u2248 u1 \u2212 v u\u20322 . With u\u20322 (z \u22c6 ) = \u2212(1 + \u03bc)u2 (z \u22c6 )/z \u22c6 and\nu2 (z \u22c6 ) \u2248 u1 (z \u22c6 ) we obtain v\u03bb \u2248 1 \u2212 v(1 + \u03bc)/z \u22c6 . Since\nz \u22c6 \u226b 1 the second term can be neglected and we find\nv \u223c \u03bb\u22121 .\n\n(14)\n\nThe dependence of \u03bb on N can be obtained by the short time\ndynamics. Consider an initial condition u(x, 0) = exp(\u2212\u03bbx)\non the half-line x \u2265 0. After a short time \u2206t \u226a 1 the\nwave front is approximately given by u(x, \u2206t) \u2248 exp \u2212\u03bbx +\n\u2206t/\u03bbx1+\u03bc . The crossover x can be defined as the point at\nwhich both terms are of the same order of magnitude, implicitly provided by \u03bb exp \u2212\u03bbx = \u2206t/x1+\u03bc . Since \u03bb \u226a 1 one\ncan approximately solve for the crossover, x \u2248 ln(\u03bb\u03bc \u2206t)/\u03bb.\nIn order for the exponential to remain invariant under the dynamics, \u03bb must be chosen such that the crossover coincides\nwith the effective cutoff, i.e. u(x, \u2206t) = \u03b5 which implies\nthe scaling relation \u03bb \u221d \u03b51/\u03bc . With Eq. (14) one obtains the\nscaling law\nv \u221d N 1/\u03bc\n\n(15)\n\nfor the velocity v.\nFig. 3 shows the front velocity v as a function of particle\nnumber N obtained by numerical integration of the dynamics\n(Eq. (11)). The numerics agree well with the scaling law (15)\nover several orders of magnitude and several choices of the\nL\u00e9vy exponent \u03bc.\n\n\f4\nthe front velocity v is constant after a transient phase, the velocity obeys the scaling law (15) and the wave front decays\nexponentially in space.\nWe are convinced that our results are of major importance\nfor the understanding of front propagation in pattern forming\nsystems in which the reactive agents defy the rules of ordinary diffusion. We have shown that constant velocity fronts\nare typical for pulled front dynamics, contrary to what is expected from mean field approximations and we believe that\nour results will contribute to the understanding of more complex pattern forming systems such as the geographic spread of\nhuman epidemics [15].\n\nFigure 3: Asymptotic front velocity v as a function of the particle\nnumber N for different L\u00e9vy exponents \u03bc = 1.2, 1.5 and 1.8 (circles, diamonds and triangles, respectively). The dashed line indicates\nthe scaling v(N ) \u223c N 1/\u03bc .\n\nFigure 4: Asymptotic front velocity in the full stochastic model. The\nsolid line depicts the total mass I(t) type A particles as a function of\ntime. The system size is L = 104 , the total number of particles in\nthe system 2.5 \u00d7 104 . Other parameters are \u03b3 = 1 and \u03bc = 1.8. A\nconstant front velocity (constant dI(t)/dt) is attained asymptotically\n(dashed line). The upper inset depicts the front velocity v(N ) as\na function of particles per site for N = 10, 25, 50, 100, 200 and\n1000 and the scaling law (15) (dashed line). The lower inset depicts\nan average n(x) of A particles at position x at an intermediate time t.\nThe average was computed from a sample of 100 realizations of the\nprocess. The dashed line indicates an exponential decay, the dotted\nline the average concentration of one particle per site.\n\nThe front propagation characteristics of the macroscopic\ndescription in terms of the reaction-superdiffusion equation\nwith effective cutoff (Eq. (11)) coincides with our simulations\nof the microscopic dynamics defined by Eqs. (2) and (3). The\nsimulation results are summarized in Fig. 4.
