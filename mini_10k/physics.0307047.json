E. Lilienfeld in 1919, and reemployed in different forms again in 1953 and 1971. Lilienfeld\ntransition radiation is a subtle kind of radiation with distinctive\nproperties that may often be unexpected in prospect, yet is intuitive\nand readily understood in retrospect. This paper distinguishes in\nclear terms between the different kinds of transition radiation, and\nshows its link to modern apparatus such as possible applications in\nthe area of x-ray microscopy, microholography, and the\nfree-electron laser .\n\nI. Introduction\nFor a static charge, it is well known that the solution for the net field\noutside a flat metal surface is the superposition of the field of the charge and that\nof its mirror-image opposite charge in the metal. For a negative charge, this is\ndue to the repulsion of the free electrons in the metal. For a positive charge this\nis due to the attraction of the free electrons. In more mathematical terms, the net\nfield may be found by solving Laplace's equation with the appropriate boundary\n\n\fconditions to obtain the potential. The field is minus the gradient of the\npotential. The result is clearly an electric dipole.\nThus for a charge moving slowly, its field penetrates well into the metal\nand a simple field pattern results. For a very fast moving charge, the field only\npenetrates with an exponential decay so that the field is largely limited within a\nskin depth of the metal's surface. Easily tractable fields result when the distance\nto the surface of the charge is small compared with the penetration depth. As we\nshall see, in either case radiation results even when no external force is applied to\naccelerate the charge, if the metal surface is not smooth.\n\nII. Radiation from Uniform motion\nThe radiation described above is not the only effect in which radiation\noccurs from seemingly uniform motion. Cerenkov radiation also occurs with no\nacceleration of the charge, when its speed exceeds the speed of light in a given\nmedium as first predicted by Arnold Sommerfeld.\nAnalogously, if a charge moves at constant velocity through a junction\nbetween two materials having different opitical properties, radiation results from\nthe change in the field the charge is carrying. The term \"Transition Radiation\" is\nused to denote radiation emanating when charged particles go from one medium\nto another. The theory of this radiation was presented by Frank and Ginsburg [1]\nin 1944, and is not at all the same as Cerenkov radiation; or the next described\nLilienfeld transition radiation.\n\nIII. Comparing Different Kinds of Radiation\nIn 1919 Lilienfeld found that in addition to x rays, radiation ranging from\nvisible light through the ultraviolet is emitted when electrons approach a metal\nelectrode.[2] This radiation has a characteristic polarization, spectrum and\n\n\fintensity. Lilienfeld transition radiation can be considered to originate from the\ntime rate of change of the virtual dipole between charged particles and their\nimage charges that forms as the charged particles move near a conducting\nsurface, as described in Section I. In Lilienfeld's original experiment, the charged\nparticles were low-energy electrons moving toward a metallic anode. This was\noriginally called, \"Lilienfeld Transition Radiation.\" Largely because of high\nenergy phyics applications Cerenkov Radiation and Transition Radiation are\ncurrently well known. Unfortunately, Lilienfeld Transition Radiation has been\nlargely forgotten.\nIn a variation of Lilienfeld transition radiation, the charged particles move\nroughly parallel to a conducting serrated surface, producing an oscillating virtual\ndipole whose frequency is related to the particle velocity and the serration\nspacing. This 1953 work has been called \"Smith-Purcell Radiation.\" [3] In 1992,\nMichael M. Moran [4] calculated the potential of x-ray generation by the SmithPurcell effect. He concluded that \"although the radiated power may be low, the\nsource brightness could be surprisingly large because of the microscopic source\narea. This together with the tunability and inherent spatial coherence of S-P\nradiation, suggests possible applications in the area of x-ray microscopy or\nmicroholography.\" In 1992 Doucas et al [6] used a beam of 3.6 MeV electrons to\ngenerate far infrared radiation by the S-P effect. Until then low-energy electrons\nwere used to produce visible radiation. Their \"emphasis is on a spectral region\nwhere the population of sources is sparse.\"\nIn some ways Lilienfeld's work anticipated the 1953 experiment of S. J.\nSmith and Edward M. Purcell [3], and possibly even John M. J. Madey's\ninvention of the free-electron laser. In 1971, John M. J. Madey [5] used the\nWeizsacker-Williams method to calculate the gain due to the induced emission of\nradiation by a relativistic motion of an electron moving through a periodic\n\n\ftransverse grating. The magnetic grating may be considered analogous to the\nperiodically serrated conducting surface of Smith and Purcell, with the important\nadded bounus of laser gain. Each may be considered to be an important and\nnovel variation of the prior work, as reflected in much of the progress of science.\nAs a graduate student I observed Lilienfeld transition radiation in 1961 in\nconnection with my doctoral thesis research, before I had ever heard of it. A\nliterature search led quickly to Lilienfeld's work. Visible polarized blue light is\neasily seen at the anode of a high voltage vacuum tube.\n\nReferences\n1. J. E.
