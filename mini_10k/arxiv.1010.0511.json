We discuss the eccentricity distribution of inspiral compact object binaries during they inspiral phase.

Introduction\nAs the interferometric gravitational wave detectors LIGO\nand VIRGO (Harry & the LIGO Scientific Collaboration 2010;\nAcernese et al. 2006) reach their design sensitivities, the first\ndetection of gravitational waves has become more imminent.\nBoth detectors will undergo serious improvements to increase\ntheir sensitivity (Smith & LIGO Scientific Collaboration 2009;\nSpallicci et al. 2005).\nIt is therefore important to investigate the properties of the\nprimary candidate sources for detection, namely compact object binaries. There have been a number of papers dealing\nwith several properties of the population of compact binaries\n(e.g., Nelemans & van den Heuvel 2001; Voss & Tauris 2003;\nDe Donder & Vanbeveren 2004; Sipior & Sigurdsson 2002;\nPfahl et al. 2005; Dewi et al. 2002, 2005; Bogomazov et al.\n2007; Kiel et al. 2010). In particular, Abadie et al. (2010) presented their estimated detection rates. In addition, the mass spectrum (Gondek-Rosi\u0144ska et al. 2007), and even spin properties\n(Schnittman 2004; Mandel & O'Shaughnessy 2010) have been\nstudied. In this paper, we present yet another aspect of the merging compact object binary population: the distribution of the eccentricity.\nFrom radio observations, we currently know of only six\ncompact object binaries with merger timescales shorter than a\nHubble time, all of them NS-NS (neutron star - neutron star)\nsystems, and we know of no BH-NS (black hole - neutron star)\nnor BH-BH (black hole - black hole) system. The known NS-NS\nsystems are listed along with their orbital parameters in Table 1.\n\nThe observed NS-NS binaries have merger times\nT merg % 100 Myr. However, a significant fraction of the\npopulation of the merging NS-NS may originate in the so-called\nultra-compact NS-NS binaries, which have much shorter merger\ntimescales T merg - 100 Myr (Belczynski et al. 2002a). In\naddition, the small number of known pulsars are indicative of\nthere being a significant fraction of very eccentric binaries.\nSince no BH-NS nor BH-BH binaries are known, we can\nonly rely on evolutionary considerations when estimating their\nnumber and properties. It has been found that their number depends very strongly on the outcome of the common envelope\nphase when the secondary is on the Hertzsprung gap. This phase\nwill very likely end up as a merger and the formation of a\nThorne-Zytkow object. However, it has been demonstrated that\nin a low-metallicity environment the common envelope mergers\nmay be (to some extent) avoided and the BH-BH formation is\nvery effective (Belczynski et al. 2010b).\nThe eccentricity of a compact object binary may potentially\nbe derived by analyzing the inspiral signal, provided that the\neccentricity is significant. In this paper, we investigate the eccentricity distributions in the frequency band of the currently\nworking and future detectors of gravitational waves. For the currently working detectors (LIGO and VIRGO), we assume that\nthe sensitivity of the detectors will allow us to measure the\nsignal for the frequencies starting at 30 Hz. This may not be\naccurate for the current state of these instruments, but it does\naccurately represent the predicted sensitivity of the Advanced\nLIGO/VIRGO detectors. We consider two future detectors:\nthe Einstein Telescope (Van Den Broeck 2010) and DECIGO\n\n\f2\n\nI. Kowalska et al.: The eccentricity distribution of compact binaries\n\n(Kawamura 2006; Seto et al. 2001). For the Einstein Telescope,\nwe assume that binaries shall be detectable from 3 Hz, and for\nDECIGO we assume that the lowest frequency detectable is\n0.3 Hz. In all cases, these have to be treated as indicative numbers that roughly describe these instruments.\nIn section 2, we describe the model used to investigate the\npopulation of compact object binaries. Section 3 presents the results for the current and future gravitational wave detectors. In\nsection 4, we summarize and discuss the results.\n\n2. The model\n\nset of models in which the magnitude of the NS kicks is lower\nby a factor of 2, to \u03c3 = 132.5 km/s, as some observations and\nempirically based arguments seem to indicate that natal kicks in\nclose binaries are lower than for single stars (Dessart et al. 2006;\nKitaura et al. 2006). The BH kicks are decreased in the similar\nfashion as in models with the full NS kicks. The standard value\nof \u03c3 parameter is denoted by K and the smaller value by k. The\ndetailed list of models considered in this paper is presented in\nTable 2. Model AZK is a standard set of parameters described in\ndetail by Belczynski et al. (2002b).\nTable 2: The list of models of stellar evolution used in the paper.\n\n2.1. Compact object binary population model\n\nTo model the population of compact object binaries, we used the\nStarTrack population synthesis code (Belczynski et al. 2002b).\nIt perform a suite of Monte Carlo simulations of the stellar\nevolution of stars in environments of two typical metallicities:\nZ = Z\u2299 = 0.02 and Z = 10% Z\u2299 = 0.002 (e.g., Belczynski et al.\n2010b). In these calculations, we employed the recent estimates\nof mass loss rates (Belczynski et al. 2010a). We calculate a population of 2 million massive binary stars, tracking the ensuing\nformation of relativistic binary compact objects: double neutron stars (NS-NS), double black hole binaries (BH-BH), and\nmixed systems (BH-NS). Our modeling utilizes updated stellar and binary physics, including results from supernova simulations (Fryer & Kalogera 2001) and compact object formation (Timmes et al. 1996), incorporating elaborate mechanisms\nfor treating stellar interactions such as mass transfer episodes\n(Belczynski et al. 2008) or tidal synchronization and circularization (Hut 1981). We place special emphasis on the common\nenvelope evolution phase (Webbink 1984), which is crucial for\nclose double compact object formation because the attendant\nmass transfer permits an efficient hardening of the binary. This\norbital contraction can be sufficiently efficient to cause the individual stars in the binary to coalesce and form a single highly\nrotating object, thereby preventing additional binary evolution\nand the formation of a double compact object. Because of significant radial expansion, stars crossing the Hertzsprung gap (HG)\nvery frequently initiate a common envelope phase. HG stars do\nnot have a clear entropy jump at the core-envelope transition\n(Ivanova & Taam 2004); if such a star overflows its Roche lobe\nand initiates a common envelope phase, the inspiral is expected\nto lead to a coalescence (Taam & Sandquist 2000). In particular, it has been estimated that for a solar metallicity environment\n(e.g., our Galaxy), properly accounting for the HG gap may lead\nto a reduction in the merger rates of BH-BH binaries by \u223c 2 \u2212 3\norders of magnitude (Belczynski et al. 2007). In contrast, in a\nlow metallicity environment this suppression is much less severe (\u223c 1 order of magnitude; Belczynski et al. (2010b)). The\ndetails of the common envelope phase are not yet fully understood, thus in what follows we consider two set of models, one\nthat does not take into account the suppression (optimistic models: marked with A), and another that assumes the maximum\nsuppression (pessimistic models: marked with B). Solar metallicity and 10% of solar metallicity are labeled with Z and z, respectively. In the case of NSs, we adopt natal kick distributions\nfrom observations of single Galactic pulsars (Hobbs et al. 2005)\nwith \u03c3 = 265 km/s. However, for BHs we draw kicks from the\nsame distribution (but at a lower magnitude), which is inverse\nproportional to the amount of fall back expected at BH formation (e.g., Fryer & Kalogera 2001). In particular, for most massive BHs that form with the full fall back (direct BH formation),\nthe amount of natal kick is zero. In addition, we test one more\n\nModel\nAZK\nBZK\nAZk\nBZk\nAzK\nBzK\nAzk\nBzk\n\nMetallicity\nZ\u2299\nZ\u2299\nZ\u2299\nZ\u2299\n10% Z\u2299\n10% Z\u2299\n10% Z\u2299\n10% Z\u2299\n\n\u03c3 [kms\u22121 ]\n265.0\n265.0\n132.5\n132.5\n265.0\n265.0\n132.5\n132.5\n\nHG\n+\n+\n+\n+\n-\n\n2.2.

Properties of the binaries at formation time\n\nWe start with an initial population created using the StarTrack\ncode. We present the properties of the population of compact\n\nobject binaries in Figures 2 - 4 in the space spanned by the initial eccentricity and initial gravitational wave frequency, which\nis twice the orbital frequency. Each panel in theses figures corresponds to a different model labeled as listed in Table 2.\nThe case of the NS-NS systems is shown in Figure 2. The\nboundary of the region populated by the systems on the left-hand\nside corresponds to the requirement that we only consider binaries that merge within a Hubble time. The bulk of the binaries\nshown in each panel correspond to those that have undergone\none CE phase in their evolution. The top row corresponds to the\nmodels AZK, AZk, AzK, and Azk, in which we allow the binaries to cross through the common envelope with the donor on the\nHertzsprung gap, denoted by \"+\" in Table 2. These binaries may\nundergo a second common envelope phase with a helium star\ncompanion. At the second CE stage, the orbit is tightened even\nmore leading to formation of the stripe in the diagram stretching\nfrom fGW \u2248 10\u22122 Hz at e \u2248 10\u22122 . In these models, the initial\ndistribution in the space of gravitational wave frequency versus\neccentricity is bimodal. The influence of the value of the kick velocity has a small impact on the shape of distributions presented\nin Figure 2 as can be seen by comparing the data in plots labeled\nas either K-large kicks or k-small kicks.\nFor BH-NS systems, presented in Figure 3, and BH-BH binaries, in Figure 4, we present the results of six out of eight\nmodels, since in models BZK and BZk, almost no binaries are\nformed in our simulations that involve 2\u00d7106 initial binaries. For\nBH-NS and BH-BH binaries, the formation of ultra-compact binaries is not expected. The formation of NS-NS ultra-compact\n\n\f4\n\nI.

Since the donor is about twice\nas massive as its companion, the CE phase is initiated by the\nnon-stable mass transfer and the orbit significantly decreased in\nsize. For more massive BH-BH/BH-NS binaries, helium stars\nare on average more massive (M > 3 \u2212 4 M\u2299 ) and do not expand\n(so no CE phase), and even if a low mass helium star forms,\nthen its companion is a BH (M > 3 M\u2299 ), so most likely instead of CE the RLOF is stable and does not lead to orbital decay (mass ratio \u223c 1). Very few systems (e.g., models AzK or\nAzk) produce ultra-compact BH-NS/BH-BH binaries for very\nspecial cases of binary evolution. In the case of BH-BH binaries, shown in Figure 4 we present only six models, since models BZK and BZk do not lead to the formation of BH-BH binaries (Belczynski et al. 2007). In all models, there is an enhanced density of systems formed with e \u2248 0.1 at approximately\n10\u22125 Hz < fGW < 10\u22124 Hz. In these systems, the second black\nhole has formed via direct collapse. When treating the direct collapse, we assume that 10% of the mass escapes in the form of\nneutrinos and possibly gravitational waves. Hence, the gravitational mass of the BH is 10% lower than the baryon mass of the\ncollapsing star. This introduces a small eccentricity \u2248 0.1 since\nthe systems were circularized in the mass transfer prior to the\ncollapse and the formation of the second BH.\n3.2. Eccentricity when binary enters detector band\n\nFor the detection of gravitational waves, it is important to know\nthe eccentricity of a binary at the time it enters the sensitivity\nwindow of the detector. We consider three cases that correspond\napproximately to three types of detectors. In Figure 5, we show\nthe eccentricity distributions at 0.3 Hz (bottom horizontal axis)\n\nand 3 Hz (top horizontal axis) corresponding approximately to\nthe ET and DECIGO detectors. The results for the Advanced\nLIGO/VIRGO can be easily obtained by rescaling the horizontal\naxis.\nThe shape of the eccentricity distributions at the moment that\nthe binary enters the given detector band follows from the corresponding initial distribution. However, one must note that for\neach type of binary there is a different natural timescale and frequency, because of the different mass scales of each binary.\nWe present the results for the DECIGO detector and add appropriate numbers for the ET in parentheses. For the NS-NS binaries shown in the top panel of Figure 5, the distribution is either centered on e \u2248 10\u22124 (ET: 10\u22125 ) for the models BZK, BZk,\nBzK, and Bzk, where we do not allow the formation of ultracompact binaries in a second CE phase. The remaining models AZK, AZk, AzK, and Azk contain another component centered roughly at e \u2248 10\u22124 (ET: 10\u22123 ). This additional component represent the ultra-compact binaries that have experienced\ntwo episodes of mass transfer in their evolutionary history and\nwere already very tight at the second supernova explosion. The\nmixed BH-NS binaries, shown in the middle panel of Figure 5\nexhibit a distribution of eccentricity centered at e \u2248 3\u00d710\u22125 (ET:\n3 \u00d7 10\u22126 ), while the eccentricity BH-BH binaries, shown in the\nbottom panel of Figure 5 lie between e \u2248 \u00d710\u22126 (ET: 10\u22127 ) and\ne \u2248 \u00d710\u22124 (ET: 10\u22125 ) .\nFor the Advanced LIGO/VIRGO detectors where we assume\nthat the low frequency boundary lies at \u2248 30 Hz, the eccentricities are even smaller. It follows from equation 4 that the distributions are shifted by a factor of 10\u221219/18 for each factor of\nten in frequency. Thus, the values of eccentricity in the case\nof Advanced LIGO/VIRGO type detectors are consistent with\ne = 0 and we can safely assume that all BH-NS and BH-BH\nbinaries are circular without any loss of sensitivity.\n\n\fI.

Solid lines correspond to evolutionary tracks for initial gravitational waves frequencies from\nf0 = 10\u22128 Hz (first line from the left-hand side) to f0 = 102 Hz (first line from the right-hand side).\nIn table 3, we present the fraction of binaries with eccentricities above 0.01 at the time of entering the detector band, to help\nquantify the extent of the large eccentricity tails of the distributions presented in Figure 5. This fraction does not reflect the detectability of eccentricity (Shapiro Key & Cornish 2010),which\nfor realistic distributions of binaries will be discussed in a forthcoming paper.\n\n4. Summary\nWe have presented the eccentricity distributions of compact object binaries at three frequencies immediately before merger.\nThe properties of the compact object binaries have been calculated using the StarTrack population synthesis code. We have\nfound that the eccentricity distributions of the compact object\nbinaries do not depend strongly on the assumed model of binary\nevolution. Any dependence has been found to be the strongest\nfor binary neutron stars, whose distributions may be either single\nor double peaked. The extra peak corresponds to ultra-compact\nNS-NS binaries that have undergone an additional CE phase immediately before forming the second NS.\nTo make the results easier to use in the simulations, we have\nfitted the resulting distributions of eccentricity with a single lognormal distribution in the case of BH-BH and BH-NS binaries\n!\n1\n(x \u2212 \u03bc)2\nf (x) = \u221a exp \u2212\n,\n(5)\n2\u03c32\n\u03c3 2\u03c0\nwhere x = log e, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the variance.\nFor the NS-NS eccentricities, we used a sum of two lognormal distributions with two weights, since the distribution is\ndouble peaked, given by\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec (x \u2212 \u03bc1 )2 \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7 (1 \u2212 w)\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec (x \u2212 \u03bc2 )2 \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\nw\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f8 ,(6)\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nf (x) =\n\u221a exp \uf8ed\u2212\n\u221a exp \uf8ed\u2212\n\uf8f8+\n2\u03c321\n2\u03c322\n\u03c31 2\u03c0\n\u03c32 2\u03c0\n\nTable 3: Fraction of the compact binaries with eccentricity\ngreater than 10\u22122 .

The results of the fits are shown in Table 4. The widths\nof the distributions \u03c3 are the same for each frequency band and\nonly the centroids move.\nThe eccentricity of the BH-BH binaries in all three cases is\nnegligible.

Second, the initial kicks at formation of BHs\nare lower than in the case of NS, so the initial eccentricities of\nBH-BH systems are typically lower than in the case of NS-NS\nones.\nThe eccentricities of the mixed BH-NS systems are larger\nthan in the case of BH-BH ones. However, the number of systems is small enough to ensure that by neglecting the eccentricity\nwe do not decrease the sensitivity of Advanced LIGO/VIRGO\ndetectors. For the ET-like detector, some eccentric systems may\nbe detected. In the case of the DECIGO-like detector, the number of systems with eccentricities above 0.01 lies between 3%\nand 4%.\nThe eccentricity of NS-NS systems are larger than those of\nbinaries containing BHs. Given a much larger expected detection\nrate for ET, this means that there should be a significant number\nof NS-NS binaries with detectable eccentricities. Finally, in the\ncase of DECIGO a fraction of between 2% and 27% of the NSNS binaries have eccentricities above 0.01. Moreover, the shape\nof the eccentricity distribution of NS-NS binaries will depend\non the existence of an evolutionary scenario leading to the formation of ultra-compact binaries. Thus, the measurement of the\neccentricity distribution is an interesting tool for probing the details of NS-NS formation scenarios.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the EGO-DIR-102-2007; the\nFOCUS 4/2007 Program of Foundation for Polish Science,\nthe Polish grants N N203 511238, DPN/N176/VIRGO/2009, N\nN203 302835, N N203 404939 and by CompStar a Research\nNetworking Programme of the European Science Foundation.\n\nReferences\nAbadie, J., Abbott, B.
