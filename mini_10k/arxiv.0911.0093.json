INTRODUCTION\n\nThe class of relatively faint X-ray sources known as\ncentral compact objects (CCOs) in supernova remnants\n(SNRs) are apparently isolated neutron stars, which we\ndefine here by their steady flux, predominantly thermal X-ray emission, lack of optical or radio counterparts, and absence of a surrounding pulsar wind nebula\n(see reviews by Pavlov et al. 2004 and De Luca 2008).\nTable 1 lists basic data on the well-studied CCOs, as\nwell as candidates whose qualifications are not well established. Of the seven most secure members, three\nare definitely pulsars with periods of 0.105, 0.112, and\n0.424 s (Gotthelf et al. 2005; Gotthelf & Halpern 2009;\nZavlin et al. 2000). Until now, no spin-down was detected from a CCO, which is most simply interpreted\nas indicating a weak surface dipole magnetic field Bs .\nIn two cases, PSR J1852+0040 (P = 0.105 s) and\n1E 1207.4\u22125209 (P = 0.424 s), the upper limits on\nBs from spin period measurements are 1.5 \u00d7 1011 G\nand 3.3 \u00d7 1011 G, respectively (Halpern et al. 2007;\nGotthelf & Halpern 2007), smaller than that of any other\nyoung neutron star. We also found Bs < 9.8 \u00d7 1011 G\nfrom a pair of observations of PSR J0821\u22124300, the\n0.112 s pulsar in Puppis A (Gotthelf & Halpern 2009).\nImportant implications of these results are that the\nbirth periods of the CCO pulsars are not significantly\ndifferent from their present values, and that their spindown luminosities are, and have always been, insufficient\nto generate significant non-thermal magnetospheric emission or synchrotron nebulae. A corollary is that the socalled \"characteristic age\" \u03c4c \u2261 P/2\u1e56 that is used to\napproximate the true age of pulsar has, for CCOs, no\nmeaning, being at least millions of years for pulsars that\nare demonstrably in supernova remnants that are only\n\na few thousand years old. It is also reasonable to suppose that some isolated radio pulsars with weak magnetic\nfields that have characteristic ages of millions of years\nmay actually be former CCOs that are only moderately\naged.\nMost of the properties of the CCOs can thus be explained by an \"anti-magnetar\" model (Halpern et al.\n2007; Gotthelf & Halpern 2008), including the possibility that their weak magnetic fields are causally related to\ntheir slow rotation periods at birth through the turbulent\ndynamo (Thompson & Duncan 1993) that generates the\nmagnetic field. (See Spruit 2008 for a review of possible\nmechanisms for the origin of magnetic fields in neutron\nstars.) While CCOs are inconspicuous relative to ordinary young pulsars and magnetars, the fact that they are\nfound in SNRs in comparable numbers to other classes\nof neutron stars implies that they must represent a significant fraction of neutron star births. Considering that\nthe CCO in Cassiopeia A is the youngest known neutron\nstar (330 yr), and postulating that a CCO in SN 1987A\nexplains why its pulsar has not yet been detected, argues\nthat anti-magnetars are potentially a populous class.\nThe compact X-ray source CXOU J185238.6+004020\nwas discovered in the center of the SNR Kes 79 by\nSeward et al. (2003). In previous papers, we reported\nthe discovery of 105 ms pulsations from that CCO, now\nnamed PSR J1852+0040 (Gotthelf et al. 2005, Paper 1),\nand the first few observations that established only an\nupper limit on its period derivative corresponding to\nBs < 1.5 \u00d7 1011 G (Halpern et al. 2007, Paper 2). Here,\nwe present a dedicated series of timing observations of\nPSR J1852+0040 that constitute the first definite measurement of the spin-down rate of a CCO pulsar, confirming its unusually small dipole magnetic field and support-\n\n\f2\n\nHalpern & Gotthelf\nTABLE 1\nCentral Compact Objects in Supernova Remnants\nCCO\n\nSNR\n\nAge\n(kyr)\n\nd\n(kpc)\n\nP\n(s)\n\nfp a\n(%)\n\nBs\n(1011 G)\n\nLx,bol\n(erg s\u22121 )\n\nReferences\n\nRX J0822.0\u22124300\nCXOU J085201.4\u2212461753\n1E 1207.4\u22125209\nCXOU J160103.1\u2212513353\n1WGA J1713.4\u22123949\nCXOU J185238.6+004020\nCXOU J232327.9+584842\nXMMU J172054.5\u2212372652\nXMMU J173203.3\u2212344518\nCXOU J181852.0\u2212150213\n\nPuppis A\nG266.1\u22121.2\nPKS 1209\u221251/52\nG330.2+1.0\nG347.3\u22120.5\nKes 79\nCas A\nG350.1\u22120.3\nG353.6\u22120.7\nG15.9+0.2\n\n3.7\n1\n7\n>\n\u223c3\n1.6\n7\n0.33\n0.9\n\u223c 27\n1\u22123\n\n2.2\n1\n2.2\n5\n1.3\n7\n3.4\n4.5\n3.2\n(8.5)\n\n0.112\n...\n0.424\n...\n...\n0.105\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n11\n<7\n9\n< 40\n<7\n64\n< 12\n...\n...\n...\n\n< 9.8\n...\n< 3.3\n...\n...\n0.31\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n6.5 \u00d7 1033\n2.5 \u00d7 1032\n2.5 \u00d7 1033\n1.5 \u00d7 1033\n\u223c 1 \u00d7 1033\n5.3 \u00d7 1033\n4.7 \u00d7 1033\n3.4 \u00d7 1033\n1.0 \u00d7 1034\n\u223c 1 \u00d7 1033\n\n1,2\n3,4,5,6,7\n8,9,10,11,12\n13,14\n7,15,16\n17,18,19,20\n20,21,22,23,24\n25\n26,27,28\n29\n\nReferences. - (1) Hui & Becker 2006; (2) Gotthelf & Halpern 2009; (3) Slane et al. 2001; (4) Kargaltsev et al. 2002; (5)\nBamba et al. 2005; (6) Iyudin et al. 2005; (7) De Luca 2008; (8) Zavlin et al. 2000; (9) Mereghetti et al. 2002; (10) Bignami et al.\n2003; (11) De Luca et al. 2004; (12) Gotthelf & Halpern 2007; (13) Park et al. 2006; (14) Park et al. 2009; (15) Lazendic et al.\n2003; (16) Cassam-Chena\u0131\u0308 et al. 2004; (17) Seward et al. 2003; (18) Gotthelf et al. 2005; (19) Halpern et al. 2007; (20) this paper;\n(21) Pavlov et al. 2000; (22) Chakrabarty et al. 2001; (23) Mereghetti et al. 2002; (24) Pavlov & Luna 2009; (25) Gaensler et al.\n2008; (26) Tian et al. 2008; (27) Acero et al. 2009; (28) Halpern & Gotthelf 2009; (29) Reynolds et al. 2006.\nNote. - Above the line are seven well-established CCOs. Below the line are three candidates.\na Upper limits on pulsed fraction are for a search down to P = 12 ms or smaller.\n\ning the anti-magnetar model. The plan that was devised\nto obtain the needed series of time-constrained observations is described in Section 2. Analysis and results of\nthe timing data are presented in Section 2.1, and the\nhigh-quality X-ray spectrum and pulse profile that were\nobtained from the summed observations are the subject\nof Section 2.2. Discussion of the anti-magnetar model,\nand possible explanations for the X-ray spectrum appear\nin Section 3, followed by the conclusions in Section 4.\nIn this paper, we adopt a distance of 7.1 kpc to Kes 79\nfrom H I and OH absorption studies (Frail & Clifton\n1989; Green & Dewdney 1992) updated using the Galactic rotation curve of Case & Bhattacharya (1998). We\nalso assume the dynamical estimate of 5.4\u20137.5 kyr for\nthe age of the SNR from Sun et al. (2004).\n2. X-RAY OBSERVATIONS\nAfter the first four timing observations of PSR\nJ1852+0040 in 2004 and 2006 (Paper 2), it was evident\nthat the frequency derivative f \u0307 was too small to measure without obtaining a phase-coherent series of observations spanning several years. The most economical way\nto measure f \u0307 is to begin with a logarithmically spaced sequence of observations that maintains the absolute cycle\ncount \u03c6(t)/2\u03c0 and measures the frequency f with increasing accuracy, until the small quadratic term in the\nphase ephemeris\n\n\u03c6(t)\n1\n= f (t \u2212 t0 ) + f \u0307(t \u2212 t0 )2 + ...\n2\u03c0\n2\nbegins to make a significant contribution to the phase.\nIn this case, it was also deemed possible (Paper 2) that\naccretion from fall-back material could contribute timing irregularities known as torque noise, of a magnitude\ncomparable to the existing upper limits on dipole spindown. This made it all the more important to obtain a\nwell-sampled ephemeris that could test for such effects.\nUnfortunately, maintaining cycle count would require\nmore observations classified as time-constrained than the\nChandra X-ray Observatory allocates to any one project,\n\nwhile for XMM-Newton, semiannual visibility windows\nfor this source are only 40 days long, not wide enough\nto securely bridge over the intervening 5 month gaps.\nIt took until 2008 to implement a strategy that uses\nthe two satellites in a coordinated fashion, filling two\nXMM-Newton visibility windows with six observations\neach of variable spacing, while requesting pairs of Chandra observations to bridge the gaps between and after the two XMM-Newton windows. In this manner, a\nphase-coherent timing solution spanning 1.7 yr could be\nachieved, which could also be extrapolated backward to\nincorporate the earlier observations. All but one of the\napproved observations in 2008\u20132009 were performed as\nplanned. Due to a loss of contact with the XMM-Newton\nspacecraft, the last observation of 2008 was rescheduled\nto 2009, but this did not compromise the success of the\nprogram. We were thus able to obtain a fully coherent timing solution incorporating all of the observations\nlisted in Table 2, including the earliest ones, spanning\n4.8 yr in total.\nAll of the XMM-Newton observations used the pn detector of the European Photon Imaging Camera (EPICpn) in \"small window\" (SW) mode to achieve 5.7 ms\ntime resolution, and an absolute uncertainty of \u2248 3 ms\non the arrival time of any photon. We processed all EPIC\ndata using the emchain and epchain scripts under Science\nAnalysis System (SAS) version xmmsas 20060628 18017.0.0. The leap second at the end of 2008 was inserted\nmanually. Simultaneous data were acquired with the\nEPIC MOS cameras, operated in \"full frame\" mode. Although not useful for timing purposes because of the 2.7 s\nreadout, the location of the source at the center of the\non-axis MOS CCDs allows a better background measurement to test for flux variability, an important indicator\nof accretion, than the EPIC-pn SW mode.\nThe Chandra observations used the Advanced Camera for Imaging and Spectroscopy (ACIS) in continuousclocking (CC) mode to provide time resolution of\n2.85 ms.

The photon arrival times in CC mode\nare adjusted in the standard processing to account for\nthe known position of the pulsar, spacecraft dither, and\nSIM offset. Absolute accuracy of the time assignment in\nChandra CC-mode is limited by the uncertainty in the\nposition of the pulsar, which was determined in Paper 2\nfrom an ACIS image. The typical accuracy of \u2248 1 pixel\nthen corresponds to an uncertainty of \u2248 3 ms, which is\nsimilar to the XMM-Newton accuracy, and is 0.03 rotations in the case of PSR J1852+0040. We will show that\nthe measured dispersion in pulse arrival times is comparable to this uncertainty.\n2.1. Results of Timing Analysis\nFor each observation in Table 2 we transformed the\nphoton arrival times to Barycentric Dynamical Time\n(TDB) using the pulsar coordinates determined in Paper 2 and reproduced in Table 3. Diffuse SNR emission\nis a significant source of background. To maximize the\npulsar signal-to-noise ratio, we used a source extraction\nradius of 12\u2032\u2032 for the XMM-Newton observations, and five\ncolumns (2.\u2032\u2032 4) for the Chandra CC-mode data. An energy cut of 1\u22125 keV was found to maximize pulsed power.\nThe pulse profile and value of the period in each observation was derived from a Z32 periodogram (Buccheri et al.\n1983), a choice of harmonics that was found to minimize the uncertainties. The resulting profiles were crosscorrelated, shifted, and summed to create a master pulse\nprofile template. Individual profiles were then cross correlated with the template to determine the time of arrival\n(TOA) at each epoch.\nStarting with the dense series of XMM-Newton observations in 2008 September, the TOAs were iteratively fitted using the TEMPO1 software. We fitted\nthe three observations from September 19\u201323 to a lin1\n\nhttp://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/tempo\n\near ephemeris, and added TOAs one at a time using a\nquadratic ephemeris, finding that the new TOA would\nmatch to < 0.1 cycles the predicted phase derived from\nthe previous set. After adding the final observation to the\nephemeris, we then worked backward in time from 2008\nSeptember to 2004 October until all 23 observations had\nbeen included. The quadratic term contributes \u22128.7 cycles of rotation over the 4.8 yr span of the ephemeris,\nwhich yields the small uncertainty in \u1e56 discussed below. The phases and errors were determined by crosscorrelating with a final iterated template of co-added\nprofiles produced from the best fitting ephemeris given in\nTable 3. Figure 1 shows the residuals of the individual\nobservations from the best fit, which demonstrates the\nvalidity of the solution. The weighted rms of the phase\nresiduals is 3.4 ms, or 0.032 pulse cycles, which is compa-\n\nFig. 1.- Pulse phase residuals for the 23 timing observations of\nPSR J1852+0040 from the best fitting ephemeris of Table 3.

Flux and Spectral Analysis\nIn Papers 1 and 2 we presented several observations of\nPSR J1852+0040 that were consistent with steady flux\nand a blackbody spectrum of kT \u2248 0.46 keV. The luminosity of 3.4 \u00d7 1033 d27.1 erg s\u22121 corresponded to a blackbody radius of only \u2248 0.8 d7.1 km. This is typical result\nfor a CCO, and indicates a concentrated hot spot that\nremains to be understood. Using the methods described\nin Paper 1, we now combine all 16 XMM-Newton observations of PSR J1852+0040 into one spectrum in order to\nsearch for deviations from a blackbody that might indicate temperature variations on the surface, or cyclotron\n\nFig. 2.- Summed pulse profile from the 16 XMM-Newton observations of PSR J1852+0040 listed in Table 2, folded using the\nephemeris of Table 3. Phase zero corresponds to the TDB epoch\nin Table 3. The pulsed fraction after correcting for background is\nfp = 64 \u00b1 2%.\n\nlines. EPIC pn and MOS spectra were fitted jointly. The\naccumulated exposure allows us to fit the spectrum over\n0.7 \u2212 7 keV, an increase in coverage over the 1 \u2212 5 keV\nrange used in the previous papers. While a single blackbody can still be fitted with a temperature of 0.46 keV,\nthe high signal-to-noise ratio and expanded energy range\nof the summed spectrum reveal systematic deviations\nfrom the fit; the reduced \u03c72\u03bd = 1.38 for 240 degrees of freedom is unacceptable (see Figure 3 and Table 4). Similar\nto the results from other CCOs, we find that a fit to two\nblackbodies is significantly improved (\u03c72\u03bd = 1.07), with\ntemperatures of kT1 = 0.30 keV and kT2 = 0.52 keV,\nwhile the corresponding radii R1 = 1.9 d7.1 km and\nR2 = 0.45 d7.1 km still cover only a small fraction of the\nsurface. Here we define radius using the phase-averaged\n2\n4\nluminosity L1,2 = 4\u03c0R1,2\n\u03c3T1,2\nregardless of the unknown\nemission geometry, which could be, for example, a concentric annulus. Adoption of the two-blackbody fit results in a higher bolometric luminosity than the single\nblackbody, 5.3 \u00d7 1033 d27.1 erg s\u22121 vs. 3.0 \u00d7 1033 d27.1\nerg s\u22121 . We don't combine the Chandra spectra here for\nan independent fit because of the increased background\nand other uncertainties involved in analyzing CC-mode\ndata for this faint source.\nAdditional spectral models that were explored include\nthe nonmagnetic neutron star hydrogen atmosphere of\nZavlin et al. (1996), and a simplified Comptonized blackbody, as described by Halpern et al. (2008) for application to anomalous X-ray pulsars. Each of these models\nfits nearly as well as the two-blackbody model because\nthey can eliminate the residual excess at high energy that\nis left by a single blackbody fit (see Figure 4 and Table 4). For the neutron star atmosphere (NSA), we fixed\nthe parameters M = 1.4 M\u2299 and R\u221e = 13.06 km (corresponding to R = 10 km), treating the effective temperature and distance as free parameters. As expected,\nthe fitted temperature is smaller than those of the blackbody models, but the fitted distance of 23.7 kpc is a\nfactor of 3.3 higher than the known value. This indicates that in the atmosphere model only \u223c 10% of the\nsurface is emitting. We are not motivated to search for\nan atmosphere model that fits to the full surface area,\n\n\fSpin-down Measurement of PSR J1852+0040\n\n5\n\nTABLE 4\nXMM-Newton Spectral Fits to PSR J1852+0040\nParameter\n\nBB\n\nBB+BB\n\nNSA\n\nComp BB\n\nNH (1022 cm\u22122 )\nkT1 (keV)\nR1 (km)\nkT2 (keV)\nR2 (km)\n\u0393\nd (kpc)\nFx (0.5 \u2212 10 keV)b\nLbol (erg s\u22121 )c\n\u03c72\u03bd (\u03bd)\n\n1.32 \u00b1 0.05\n0.460 \u00b1 0.007\n0.72 d7.1\n. . .\n. . .\n. . .\n. . .\n2.0 \u00d7 10\u221213\n3.0 \u00d7 1033 d27.1\n1.38(204)\n\n1.82+0.23\n\u22120.18\n0.30 \u00b1 0.05\n1.9 d7.1\n0.52 \u00b1 0.03\n0.45 d7.1\n. . .\n. . .\n2.0 \u00d7 10\u221213\n5.3 \u00d7 1033 d27.1\n1.07(201)\n\n1.67+0.06\n\u22120.07\n0.287 \u00b1 0.007\n13.06a\n. . .\n. . .\n. . .\n23.7+4.0\n\u22122.6\n2.0 \u00d7 10\u221213\n. . .\n1.10(204)\n\n1.53+0.09\n\u22120.08\n0.396 \u00b1 0.014\n0.93 d7.1\n. . .\n. . .\n4.80+0.34\n\u22120.25\n. . .\n2.0 \u00d7 10\u221213\n3.6 \u00d7 1033 d27.1\n1.12(203)\n\nNote. - Spectrum fitted over 0.7 \u2212 7 keV.

The spectrum of PSR J1852+0040 can\nnow be understood in terms of its weaker surface B-field.\nFor Bs = 3.1 \u00d7 1010 G, the cyclotron fundamental and\nfirst harmonic are at 0.27 keV and 0.54 keV, below the\nregion accessible to X-ray spectroscopy (Figure 3), especially because of the larger intervening column density\nto PSR J1852+0040. The same explanation applied to\nother well-observed CCOs suggests that they also have\nweaker surface B-fields than 1E 1207.4\u22125209.\n\nFig. 5.- Energy-resolved pulse profiles from the summed 16\nXMM-Newton observations of PSR J1852+0040 of Figure 2 decomposed into four energy bands containing equal numbers of photons.\nBackground has been subtracted.

The\npulse shape does not appear to be a function of energy (Figure 5), which also suggests that the emitting\narea is small. The fitted column density from any model\nin Table 4 agrees reasonably well with the NH derived\nfrom fits to the SNR spectrum. Sun et al. (2004) find\nNH = (1.54 \u2212 1.78) \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 from fitting a variety of equilibrium and non-equilibrium ionization models to ASCA and Chandra spectra of the SNR, while\nGiacani et al. (2009) find NH = (1.52\u00b10.02)\u00d71022 cm\u22122\nfrom fitting a non-equilibrium ionization model to the\nXMM-Newton observations of 2004.\nWe then searched for any indication of variability by\nextracting and fitting the spectrum of each individual\nobservation, fixing the spectral parameters (except for\nthe total flux) to those of the summed spectrum. In\norder to minimize statistical and systematic errors in this\ncomparison, we restricted the fitted energy range to 1 \u2212\n5 keV for the individual spectra. The resulting individual\nfluxes are shown in Figure 6, where they are seen to\nbe constant within errors. The mean 1 \u2212 5 keV flux is\n1.9 \u00d7 10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 . The typical 1\u03c3 uncertainty\nin each observation is \u2248 10%, and the rms dispersion\namong the 23 observations is 10%.\nUnlike the unique case of 1E 1207.4\u22125209, there\nis no evidence for cyclotron absorption lines in the\n\n3. DISCUSSION\n3.1. CCOs as Anti-Magnetars\nThe steady spin-down of PSR J1852+0040 is consistent with magnetic braking of an isolated neutron star\nwith a weak magnetic field of Bs = 3.1 \u00d7 1010 G. In\nthis case, the derived characteristic age of 192 Myr is\nnot meaningful because the pulsar was born spinning\nat its current period, P = 0.105 s, as was the case\nfor the other CCO pulsars, 1E 1207.4\u22125209 and PSR\nJ0821\u22124300, which have P = 0.424 s and P = 0.112 s,\nrespectively. A recent population analysis of radio pulsars by Faucher-Gigu\u00e8re & Kaspi (2006) favors such a\nwide distribution of birth periods (Gaussian centered on\n\u223c 300 ms, \u03c3 \u223c 150 ms).\nA B-field of this magnitude could be just the fossil field\nleft by flux conservation during the contraction of the\ncore of the progenitor star, as originally hypothesized for\nneutron stars by Woltjer (1964). Under this hypothesis,\nCCOs could simply be those neutron stars in which no\nadditional mechanism of B-field amplification has been\neffective. As stronger fields can be generated by a turbulent dynamo whose strength depends on the rotation rate\nof the proto-neutron star (Thompson & Duncan 1993), it\nis natural that pulsars born spinning slowly would have\n\nFig. 6.- Fluxes in the 1 \u2212 5 keV band for the 23 individual observations of PSR J1852+0040, fitted to the two blackbody model\ngiven in Table 4.

The spin-up limit for recycled pulsars corresponds to\nP (ms) = 1.9 (B/109 G)4/3 (van den Heuvel 1987).\n\nthe weaker B-fields. The model of Bonanno et al. (2006)\nsupports this, in particular finding that the B-field of a\nslowly rotating neutron star should be confined to smallscale regions, while a global dipole that would be responsible for spin-down is absent.\nPSR J1852+0040 falls in a region of (P, \u1e56 ) parameter\nspace (Figure 7) that is devoid of ordinary (non-recycled)\nradio pulsars (Manchester et al. 2005). It overlaps with\nrecycled pulsars in this area. The spin parameters of PSR\nJ1852+0040 are not beyond the empirical or theoretical radio pulsar death lines of Faucher-Gigu\u00e8re & Kaspi\n(2006) or Chen & Ruderman (1993), respectively. One\npossible explanation for the absence of radio emission\nfrom CCOs is low-level accretion of SN debris for thousands or even millions of years. However, the sample of\nCCOs is not yet large enough to know if they are intrinsically radio quiet.\nBinary pulsars with similar spin parameters as PSR\nJ1852+0040 are thought to have been partly spun up\nby accretion. It was also suggested by Deshpande et al.\n(1995) that most single pulsars in this region are recycled, the birth rate of pulsars with Bs < 1011.5 G being\ntoo low in their estimation, perhaps one in \u223c 5000 yr.\nTo the contrary, Hartman et al. (1997) concluded that it\nis not possible to distinguish ordinary pulsars of Bs =\n1010.5\u221211.5 from recycled ones, and that there is no reason to suppose that any such single pulsar is recycled.\nThe measurements of spin parameters of CCOs certainly\nincreases the inferred birth rate of neutron stars in this\nweak B-field regime, a renewed warning not to assume\nthat isolated radio pulsars with similar spin parameters\nare recycled. It should be expected that many of the \u2248 52\nradio pulsars with Bs < 1011 G and 0.1 < P < 0.7 s\nin Figure 7 have characteristic ages that are meaningless, being hundreds of millions of years. They have not\n\n7\n\nmoved in the (P, \u1e56 ) diagram, and may be former CCOs\nwhose SNRs dissipated only 105 \u2212 106 yr ago. Once the\nSNR has disappeared and the neutron star has cooled,\nit is difficult to recognize and classify such an \"orphan\nCCO\" using X-rays unless it was first selected as a radio\npulsar. Allowing for this observational handicap, CCOs\nhaving weak B-fields may represent a channel of neutron\nstar birth that is as common as any other.\nThis outcome is counter in its details to the long debated \"injection\" hypothesis. Using the \"pulsar current\" analysis proposed by Phinney & Blandford (1981),\nVivekanand & Narayan (1981) and Narayan (1987) suggested that a large fraction of pulsars are injected with\n0.5 < P < 1.0 s and \u1e56 > 1 \u00d7 10\u221214 (i.e., with large\nmagnetic field), or that neutron stars do not turn on\nas radio pulsars until their \u1e56 decreases below a critical\nvalue of \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u221213 . This would require that they also\ncool rapidly in order not to be detected as thermal X-ray\nsources in SNRs. Later investigators (e.g., Lyne et al.\n1985; Lorimer et al. 1993) argued that this interpretation suffers from substantial statistical uncertainties and\nselection effects in pulsar surveys, and that injection of\na distinct population of pulsars is not necessary. While\nprevious authors dismissed the possibility of injection of\nradio pulsars with weak B-fields (e.g., Srinivasan et al.\n1984), this appears to be exactly the origin of radioquiet CCOs. The related problem of the missing pulsars\nin empty-shell SNRs (Gotthelf 1998) has largely been\nsolved in recent years through a variety of channels, as\nsummarized by Kaspi & Helfand (2002), including the\ndetection of radio-faint pulsars, pulsar wind nebulae in\nX-rays, and now, pulsations from CCOs.\nThe spin-down power \u0116 = 3.0 \u00d7 1032 erg s\u22121 of PSR\nJ1852+0040 is an order of magnitude smaller than its\nobserved thermal X-ray luminosity, Lx \u2248 5.3 \u00d7 1033 d27.1\nerg s\u22121 , which argues that the latter is mostly residual\ncooling. Remaining questions presented by the X-ray\nproperties of PSR J1852+0040 and other CCOs are focussed on the details of their X-ray spectra and pulse profiles, which require small heated areas. In the case of PSR\nJ1852+0040, the spectrum is more complex than a single blackbody. In the two blackbody model, for example,\nthe hotter component, of temperature kT2 = 0.52 keV,\nhas an area of only \u223c 2.5 d27.1 km2 . The canonical openfield-line polar cap has area Apc = 2\u03c0 2 R3 /P c \u2248 1.1 km2 ,\nwhich is comparable to the area of the hot spot, but polar cap heating by any magnetospheric accelerator must\nbe negligible in this case, being much smaller than the\nspin-down power. Accretion may cover a wider area\nand generate more luminosity, but that process is also\nproblematic for PSR J1852+0040, as discussed below.\nIn the remainder of this section we discuss alternative\nhypotheses for the weak surface B-fields and thermal\nhot spots of CCOs, involving internal magnetic fields,\nanisotropic conduction, and accretion of fall-back material. Although these theories have some attractive properties, they are speculative, and none yet offers a selfconsistent explanation for all of the observed properties\nof CCOs.\n3.2. Localized Heating by Magnetic Field Decay?\nWhile the X-ray luminosity of PSR J1852+0040, 5 \u00d7\n1033 erg s\u22121 , is consistent with minimum neutron star\n\n\f8\n\nHalpern & Gotthelf\n\ncooling scenarios (Page et al. 2004, 2007) for the age of\nKes 79 (5.4\u20137.5 kyr, Sun et al. 2004), the high temperatures and small surface areas fitted to the X-ray spectrum are difficult to understand without invoking either\nlocalized heating on the surface or strongly anisotropic\nconduction. We recall that the X-ray spectra and luminosities of CCOs are not very different from those of\nquiescent magnetars, another recently recognized class,\nbeing attributable largely to one or two surface thermal\nemission components (e.g., Halpern & Gotthelf 2005). It\nis difficult to distinguish CCOs from quiescent magnetars without timing data or evidence about variability\n(Halpern & Gotthelf 2009). Thus, it is tempting to hypothesize that the same magnetic field decay that is\nthought to be responsible for localized crustal heating\nin a magnetar can be operating in CCOs. However, in\nthe case of CCOs, such B-fields would need to have the\nsame 1014 \u2212 1015 G strengths as in magnetars to account\nfor continuous X-ray luminosities of 1033 \u2212 1034 erg s\u22121 ,\nwhile having insignificant dipole moments that do not\ncontribute to spin-down. One such configuration would\nbe a small \"sunspot\" dipole on the rotational equator,\nto account for the large pulse modulation, while the rest\nof the star contributes dipole Bs < 3 \u00d7 1010 G in order not to exceed the observed spin-down rate. While\nwe cannot rule out this possibility, it would be remarkable if the magnetic field of a neutron star could be created or evolve into a configuration with such extreme\ncontrast. Also, the conspicuous lack of X-ray variability\nfrom CCOs argues against invoking the same magnetic\nfield strength and heating mechanism that is held responsible for magnetars, with their ubiquitous variability.\n3.3. Anisotropic Conduction?\nWe next turn to the possibility that magnetic field\nconfined entirely beneath the surface can be responsible for the nonuniformity of surface temperature. While\na strong B-field is a favored ingredient of models for\nanisotropic conduction, PSR J1852+0040 with its exceptionally weak dipole field would seem the least likely\ncandidate for such an explanation. Nevertheless, it is\npossible that a strong toroidal field can exist under the\nsurface, while only a weak external poloidal field contributes to spin-down. A toroidal field is expected to be\nthe initial configuration generated by differential rotation\nin the proto-neutron star dynamo (Thompson & Duncan\n1993). The effects on the surface temperature distribution of an internal toroidal field were calculated by\nP\u00e9rez-Azor\u0131\u0301n et al. (2006), Geppert et al. (2006), and\nPage et al. (2007). One of the effects of crustal toroidal\nfield is to insulate the magnetic equator from heat conduction, resulting in warm spots at the poles. It was\neven shown that the warm regions can be of different sizes due to the antisymmetry of the poloidal component of the field, which is reminiscent of the asymmetric opposing thermal regions in the Puppis A CCO\n(Gotthelf & Halpern 2009).\nIn order to explain the large observed pulsed fraction\nof PSR J1852+0040, the axis of toroidal magnetic field\nmust make a large angle with respect to the rotation axis\nof the neutron star. An orthogonal configuration was\nin fact adopted by Geppert et al. (2006) and Page et al.\n(2007). Even if the toroidal field component is initially\nparallel to the rotation axis, a toroidal field will deform\n\nthe neutron star into a prolate shape, which tends toward\northogonality to the rotation axis as a minimum energy\nconfiguration (Braithwaite 2009). The main problems\nwith this mechanism are 1) anisotropic conduction is unlikely to produce a small hot region on PSR J1852+0040\nthat covers only \u223c 1% of the surface area of the neutron star, and 2) it doesn't explain why only one of the\northogonal poles is evidently hot.\nFurthermore, to have a significant effect on the heat\ntransport, the crustal toroidal field strength required\nin these models is \u223c 1015 G, many orders of magnitude greater than the poloidal field if the latter\nis measured by the spin-down. Purely toroidal or\npoloidal fields are thought to be unstable (Tayler 1973;\nFlowers & Ruderman 1977), although the toroidal field\nmay be stabilized by a poloidal field that is several orders of magnitude smaller (Braithwaite 2009), so this\nmay be a viable configuration for a CCO. On the other\nhand, twisting and breaking of the crust by such a large\ntoroidal field is the basis of the magnetar model for\nsoft gamma-ray repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars\n(Thompson et al. 2002), which also have large external\ndipole fields as measured by their rapid spin-down. In\nthis picture, a CCO is a magnetar-in-waiting, a scenario\nthat Pavlov & Luna (2009) found somewhat contrived,\nas do we. If any pulsar could be an incipient magnetar,\nit isn't explained why CCOs have especially weak surface\nfields compared to ordinary pulsars.\n3.4. Submergence of Magnetic Field by Hypercritical\nAccretion?\nFor as long as the SN explosion mechanism has been\nstudied, it has been noted that a newly born neutron star may accrete large amounts of fall-back material in the hours to months after the SN. This could\nbe submerge the initial magnetic field into the core\n(Geppert et al. 1999), and the surface field could be essentially zero if the accreted matter is not highly magnetized in a well-ordered fashion. After the accretion\nstops, the submerged field will diffuse back to the surface (Muslimov & Page 1995), but this could take hundreds to millions of years (Geppert et al. 1999). In this\npicture, the CCOs could be those neutron stars that suffered the most fall-back accretion, while the normal pulsars with ages of a few thousand years must have accreted\n<< 0.01 M\u2299. In the model of Muslimov & Page (1995)\nwith accretion of \u223c 10\u22125 M\u2299 , the regrowth of the surface field is largely complete after \u223c 103 yr, so this would\nprobably not explain the weak field of PSR J1852+0040.\nBut if > 0.01 M\u2299 is accreted, then the diffusion time\ncould be millions of years. Chevalier (1989) calculated\nthat the neutron star in SN 1987A could have accreted\n\u223c 0.1 M\u2299 of fallback material in the hours after the SN\nexplosion, aided by a reverse shock from the helium layer\nof the progenitor. If so, it may never emerge as a radio pulsar. A more normal type II SN should accrete\n10\u22123 M\u2299 or less, which may delay the emergence of the\nmagnetic field for tens of thousands of years, a timescale\napplicable to explaining the properties of CCOs.\nFinally, it should be considered that a thermoelectric\ninstability mechanism driven by the strong temperature\ngradient in the outer crust (Blandford et al. 1983) could\nregenerate the magnetic field submerged by accretion.\nHowever, the growth of the field via this mechanism could\n\n\fSpin-down Measurement of PSR J1852+0040\ntake \u223c 105 yr. CCOs could then be those neutron stars\nin which the thermoelectric instability is the dominant\nmechanism of generating magnetic field, perhaps because\ntheir initial rotation rates are slow.\nThe models discussed here have the effect of delaying\nthe emergence of a normal magnetic field for times ranging from a thousand years to essentially forever. They\nare difficult to test using CCOs, for which it is impossible\nto measure the braking index, which could indicate field\namplification. Furthermore, they don't help to explain\nthe small, hot surface areas seen in the X-ray spectra\nof CCOs. In order to achieve such a configuration, the\nmagnetic field would have to be submerged everywhere\nexcept for one or two small regions, perhaps the magnetic poles of the neutron star, which could remain hot\nvia conduction from the interior.\n3.5. Continuing Accretion from a Fall-Back Disk?\nWe also consider ongoing accretion from a fallback disk of supernova debris as a possible source of\nanisotropic surface heating. While variability is an indicator of accretion, we do not have evidence of any variations of PSR J1852+0040 at the 10% level among 23\nobservations spanning 4.8 yr, which would tend to eliminate accretion as a significant contributor to its X-ray luminosity. However, although accretion is widely considered to be an inherently unstable process, it is not clear\nthat variability of X-ray binaries or AGNs can be extrapolated to accretion from a fossil disk at rates of only\n\u223c 10\u22125 LEdd. Therefore, we also explore the possibility\nof accretion, constrained only by the steady spin-down\nrate of PSR J1852+0040, using the theory of propeller\nand accretion-disk torques.\nThe spin parameters of PSR J1852+0040 fall in a\nregime in which both dipole braking and accretion\ntorques are conceivably significant. In Paper 2, we discussed the implications for \u1e56 of PSR J1852+0040 accreting and spinning down in the propeller regime, deriving\n\u1e56 \u2248 2.2 \u00d7 10\n\n\u221216\n\n8/7\n\u03bc28\n\n3/7\n\u1e4013\n\n\u0012\n\nM\nM\u2299\n\n\u0013\u22122/7\n\n\u22121\nI45\n\n\u0012\n\nP\n0.105 s\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nP\n\u00d7 1\u2212\nPeq\nfor the propeller effect. In this model, \u1e40 is the rate of\nmass expelled, which must be > \u1e41, which is the accretion rate onto the neutron star. We can therefore assume\nLX = \u03b7 \u1e41 c2 to calculate a lower limit on \u1e40 in the propeller accretion scenario. Assuming efficiency \u03b7 \u223c 0.1,\n\u1e40 > 5 \u00d7 1013 g s\u22121 is required. But if we were to adopt\n\u03bc = Bs R3 , where Bs = 3.1 \u00d7 1010 G from assuming\ndipole spin-down, then the observed \u1e56 = 8.68 \u00d7 10\u221218\nallows a negligible \u1e40 < 3 \u00d7 108 g s\u22121 , which contradicts\nthe accretion assumption.\nIf instead we use the measured \u1e56 as an upper limit on\nthe propeller spindown rate, we can derive an upper limit\non the required \u03bc in the accretion scenario. Under these\nassumptions, \u03bc < 3.4 \u00d7 1026 G cm3 , or Bs < 3.4 \u00d7 109 G.\nHowever, this would marginally violate the conditions of\nthe propeller model, because for such a small magnetic\n\n9\n\nfield, the magnetospheric radius is\n\u0013\u22121/7\n\u0012\nM\n\u22122/7\n4/7\n= 2.6\u00d7107 cm,\nrm = 2.3\u00d7107 \u03bc26 \u1e4013\nM\u2299\nwhich is smaller than the corotation radius\n\u0012 \u00132/3\nP\n1/3\nrco = (G M )\n= 3.7 \u00d7 107 cm,\n2\u03c0\nand the pulsar would be rotating near its equilibrium period. But there has not been enough time in the life of\nKes 79 for a weakly accreting pulsar to come into equilibrium. To find PSR J1852+0040 in an equilibrium state\nwould be a remarkable coincidence because its spin-down\ntimescale, P/\u1e56 \u223c 4 \u00d7 108 yr, is orders of magnitude\ngreater than its age. Therefore, it is more natural to\nconclude that the small \u1e56 of PSR J1852+0040 is due\npurely to dipole spin-down, and that it is not accreting.\nAbsence of accretion would also argues against nonuniform surface composition as a cause of the temperature\nvariations. Finally then, none of the possible mechanisms\ndiscussed here for hot spots on CCOs is entirely natural\nand self-consistent.\n4. CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK\n\nMeasurement of the spin-down rate of the 105 ms PSR\nJ1852+0040 in Kes 79 was achieved using X-ray observations coordinated between XMM-Newton and Chandra. The resulting phase-connected ephemeris spanning 4.8 yr requires only the first derivatives of the\nspin frequency, with no measurable timing noise superposed. The straightforward interpretation of this result\nis dipole spin-down due to a weak surface magnetic field\nof Bs = 3.1\u00d71010 G, the smallest measured for any young\nneutron star. While this is the first measurement of the\nspin-down rate of a CCO, upper limits on the period\nderivatives of 1E 1207.4\u22125209 and PSR J0821\u22124300, as\nwell as spectral features in those two, also indicate weak\nB-fields. The properties of the CCO class were loosely\ndefined in the past, but it is now evident that a weak\nB-field is the physical reason that a large fraction of the\nneutron stars were so named. The body of evidence supports the \"anti-magnetar\" model for the origin of such\nCCOs: neutron stars born spinning \"slowly\" may as a\nresult be endowed with only weak magnetic fields. PSR\nJ1852+0040 falls in a region of (B, P ) space that overlaps with moderately recycled pulsars. Single radio pulsars with similar spin parameters may therefore be former CCOs rather than recycled, and they may be much\nyounger than their characteristic ages. X-ray observations of pulsars in this region may find evidence of their\nrelative youth via surface thermal emission.\nOngoing timing studies of the CCOs 1E 1207.4\u22125209\nand PSR J0821\u22124300 will able to measure their spindown rates and can refine the correspondence between spectral features interpreted as electron cyclotron\nlines and surface B-field. Those CCOs such as PSR\nJ1852+0040, with no apparent absorption lines, may\nsimply have weaker B-fields than the others by a factor\n2 \u2212 3, so that the cyclotron resonance is below the soft\nX-ray band. As for CCOs that have not yet been seen\nto pulse, there is no reason to suppose that they are of\na different physical class. Rather, their surface tempera-\n\n\f10\n\nHalpern & Gotthelf\n\nture distributions and/or viewing geometries may deliver\nonly weak modulation that happens to fall below the sensitivity of existing data, while deeper observations may\nsucceed in discovering their spins. It would be of great\ninterest to discover pulsations from the CCO in Cas A,\nthe youngest known neutron star, which in all respects is\nthe prototype of the CCO class. At an age of 330 yr, it\nis an order of magnitude younger than the others, while\nhaving similar spectral properties (Pavlov & Luna 2009).\nIn our model, its spin parameters were fixed at birth, and\nshould conform closely to those of the older CCOs. A recent Chandra observation of the Cas A CCO did not detect pulsations (see Appendix), but the High Resolution\nCamera (HRC) that was employed lacks energy resolution, a capability that may be crucial in the same way\nthat it was for the XMM-Newton discovery of the pulsar\nin Puppis A (Gotthelf & Halpern 2009).\nA remaining theoretical puzzle about CCOs is the origin of their surface temperature anisotropies, in particular, the one or two warm/hot regions that are smaller\nthan the full neutron star surface. The high signal-tonoise spectrum accumulated from PSR J1852+0040 reveals similar temperature structure as the other CCOs.\nThe measured spin-down power of PSR J1852+0040 is\ntoo small by an order of magnitude to contribute to these\nexcess emissions. We considered whether accretion of\nfall-back material can be responsible for this effect, but\nfind it unlikely in the case of PSR J1852+0040 because\nof its slow, steady spin-down. If other CCOs are found to\nhave similar spin-down properties, the same arguments\nwould apply to them. Therefore, it is important to measure the spin-down rate of PSR J0821\u22124300, the CCO\nin Puppis A, and investigate further its apparent phasedependent emission line at 0.8 keV (Gotthelf & Halpern\n2009), which may be indicative of accretion because it is\nin emission.\nThe small regions of high surface temperature are prop-\n\nerties that CCOs share with magnetars, although most\nmagnetars are hotter and more luminous. The total Xray luminosities of CCOs are consistent with slow cooling\nscenarios, and there would be no need to hypothesize a\nmechanism of magnetic field amplification beyond simple\nflux freezing if it were not for their strongly anisotropic\nsurface temperature distributions. Paradoxically, the explanations that have been considered for hot spots invoke\nstrong magnetic fields just below the surface, which is\nexactly the basis of the magnetar model. In this sense,\nCCOs are potentially magnetars waiting to emerge, or\nmaybe ordinary neutron stars in which the original field\nwas submerged by especially massive fall-back of supernova debris. This is an unsatisfying picture, if only because the contrast between field strength in different regions must be a factor of 104 or larger to affect the surface temperature distribution while maintaining the slow\nspin-down and allowing soft X-ray cyclotron lines. Resolving this essential mystery of the CCOs will undoubtedly generate new insight into the physics of neutron\nstars.\nWe thank Fernando Camilo for supplying Figure 5.\nThis investigation is based on observations obtained with\nXMM-Newton, an ESA science mission with instruments\nand contributions directly funded by ESA Member States\nand NASA, and Chandra. The opportunity to propose a large project that included coordinated observations between XMM-Newton and Chandra was crucial for the success of this long-term effort. Financial\nsupport was provided by NASA through XMM grant\nNNX08AX71G and Chandra Awards SAO GO8-9060X,\nSAO GO9-0058X, and SAO GO9-0080X issued by the\nChandra X-ray Observatory Center, which is operated\nby the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory for and\non behalf of NASA under contract NAS8-03060.\n\nAPPENDIX\nSEARCH FOR X-RAY PULSATIONS FROM THE CAS A CCO\nIn this Appendix we report on analysis of a recent Chandra observation designed to be the most sensitive yet to\nsearch for pulsations from CXOU J232327.9+584842, the CCO in Cas A. But first we summarize the results of previous\nattempts. Murray et al. (2002) searched a 50 ks Chandra HRC observation and identified several candidate periods,\nbut none was confirmed in a follow-up 50 ks observation (Ransom 2002). Pavlov & Luna (2009) found from a Chandra\nACIS observation taken in subarray mode fp (3\u03c3) < 16% for P > 0.7 s. That mode is limited by its sampling time of\n0.34 s. ACIS in full-frame mode has a sampling time of 3.2 s, so is only sensitive to periods > 6.4 s. For the 1 Ms\nof data taken in this mode (Huang et al. 2004) we searched the range 6.4 \u2264 P \u2264 100 s and f \u0307 \u2264 1 \u00d7 10\u221211 Hz s\u22121 ,\ncorresponding to \u03c4c \u2265 330 yr. The resulting upper limit is fp < 4% at 99% confidence. Existing XMM-Newton data\non CXOU J232327.9+584842 are also limited in sensitivity and time resolution, and do not cover the full range of\nperiods spanned by known CCO pulsars. Using an effective exposure of 9.2 ks in the EPIC pn taken in full-frame\nmode, Mereghetti et al. (2002) reported an upper limit of fp < 13% for P > 0.3 s, and fp < 7% for P > 3 s. However,\nthese limits may have been underestimated by a factor of 2 \u2212 3 (see Pavlov & Luna 2009). Our own analysis sets limits\nof fp < 32% for 0.146 ms < P \u2264 3 s and fp < 17% for P > 3 s from this observation. Improvements in sensitivity and\ntime resolution could be obtained with a longer XMM-Newton observation using the EPIC pn in SW mode, as was\nemployed for the other CCO pulsars.\nRecently, 487 ks of Chandra HRC timing data were obtained over a period of 11 days in 2009 March, of which 433 ks\nare in the public archive. We searched the public data for pulsations. A total of 11,486 counts were extracted from\na circular aperture of radius 1.\u2032\u2032 2, of which 6% are estimated to be background. We sampled (f, f \u0307) parameter space\nusing the Z12 test, which is an optimal one for a source in which the light curve, presumed to arise from surface thermal\nemission, is expected to be weakly modulated and quasi-sinusoidal. We limited the search range to f \u2264 200 Hz for\nf \u0307 \u2264 5 \u00d7 10\u221213 Hz s\u22121 , f \u2264 100 Hz for f \u0307 \u2264 3 \u00d7 10\u221212 Hz s\u22121 , and f \u2264 10 Hz for f \u0307 \u2264 1 \u00d7 10\u221210 Hz s\u22121 , oversampling\nby a factor of \u2248 3 in each parameter. This range covers the parameters of all the known CCO pulsars and magnetars.\n\n\fSpin-down Measurement of PSR J1852+0040\n\n11\n\nThe largest values of Z12 found were \u2248 40. The theoretical distribution of noise power is exponential with a mean of\n2, so the single trial probability that Z12 > 40 by chance is 2 \u00d7 10\u22129 . Such a value is expected to arise randomly in\nthe \u223c 2 \u00d7 109 independent trials that\np were performed, so it is not significant. The expectation value of the intrinsic\npulsed fraction is fp = (1 + Nb /Ns ) 2Z12 /N , where Nb /Ns = 0.06/0.94 is the ratio of background to source counts,\nand N = Ns + Nb = 11, 486 is the total number of counts. In this case, a sinusoidal signal of fp = 9.0% would have\na 50% probability of giving Z12 > 40. However, taking into account the noise, which may either increase or decrease\nthe total power, the 99% upper limit on the Z12 of a true signal in this case is 75 (Groth 1975; Vaughan et al. 1994),\ncorresponding to fp < 12.2%. On the other hand, these peak power values are somewhat overestimated because we\noversampled Fourier space. Finally, then, we adopt an upper limit of fp < 12% for P > 10 ms in Table 1, which is the\nlowest limit yet obtained for Cas A over the range of periods that is spanned by the known CCO pulsars.\nREFERENCES\nAcero, F., P\u00fchlhofer, G., Klochkov, D., Komin, Nu., Gallant, Y.,\n& Horns, D., & Santangleo, A. 2009, Proc. 31st Int.
