Connes's theorem shows that cyclic\nhomology is indeed a far-reaching generalisation of de Rham cohomology for\nnoncommutative topological algebras, and serves as a central motivation for\nthe results here.\nSince [11], there have been extensions in different directions including the case\nof non-compact manifolds due to Pflaum [31], the equivariant case studied by\nBlock and Getzler [4] and the case of \u00e9tale groupoids and foliations [9,12]. In\nthis paper we take up the suggestion of [7] and prove the following generalisation of the Connes and Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg theorem. Let A be\na stable continuous trace C \u2217 -algebra with spectrum a smooth, compact manifold X. Then by [17], A = C(X, K(P )) is the algebra of continuous sections\nof a locally trivial bundle K(P ) = P \u00d7P U K on X with fibre the algebra K of\ncompact operators on a separable Hilbert space associated to a principal P U\nbundle P on X via the adjoint action of P U on K. Here P U is the group of\nprojective unitary operators on the Hilbert space. Such algebras A are classified up to isomorphism by their Dixmier-Douady invariant \u03b4(P ) \u2208 H 3 (X; Z).\nStandard approximation theorems show that the transition functions of P\ncan be taken to be smooth and so inside A we can consider a dense, canonical\nsmooth \u2217-subalgebra A = C \u221e (X, L1 (P )) consisting of all smooth sections of\nthe sub-bundle L1 (P ) = P \u00d7P U L1 of K(P ) with fibre the algebra L1 of trace\nclass operators on the Hilbert space and structure group P U. Then a central\nresult in this paper is the following,\nTheorem 1.1 The Hochschild homology HH\u2022 (A) of the Fr\u00e9chet algebra A is\nisomorphic to the space of differential forms \u03a9\u2022 (X) and the periodic cyclic homology HP\u2022 (A) is isomorphic to the twisted de Rham cohomology H \u2022 (X; c(P ))\n1\nfor some closed 3-form c(P ) on X such that 2\u03c0i\nc(P ) represents the image of\n\u03b4(P ) in real cohomology.\nRecall from [6] that the twisted de Rham cohomology H \u2022 (X; c(P )) of the\nmanifold X is defined as the cohomology of the complex (\u03a9\u2022 (X), d \u2212 c), where\nc denotes exterior multiplication by the closed 3-form c = c(P ). By choosing\na connection \u2207 on L1 (P ) satisfying a derivation property with respect to the\nalgebra structure we construct a chain map Ch from the complex computing\nperiodic cyclic homology to the twisted de Rham complex (\u03a9\u2022 (X), d \u2212 c). By\nexamining the behaviour of this map when we perturb the connection \u2207 we\nare able to deduce that this chain map is locally a quasi-isomorphism on X.\nStandard double complex arguments then give that Ch is a quasi-isomorphism\nglobally. Extensions to \u2217-algebras of smooth sections of a smooth algebra\nbundle with fibre the algebra of operators belonging to the Schatten class\nideal Lp are also discussed.\nRecall from [34] that the twisted K-theory is by definition K i (X, P ) = Ki (A),\n2\n\n\fwhich is in turn isomorphic to Ki (A) as argued in section 4.2. In [6,27], it was\nestablished that the twisted K-theory K\u2022 (A) could be identified with so-called\n\u2022\n'bundle gerbe K-theory', Kbg\n(X, P ) (also denoted by K \u2022 (X, P )), thus giving\na geometric description of elements of twisted K-theory. Using this geometric\ndescription, it was established that there is a twisted Chern character chP :\nK \u2022 (X, P ) \u2192 H \u2022 (X, c(P )) possessing certain functorial properties.\nIt turns out that the Connes-Chern character homomorphism ch : Ki (A) \u2192\nHPi (A) satisfies the same functorial properties. This is not surprising, once\nwe establish that under the natural identifications K\u2022 (A) with K \u2022 (X, P ), and\nHP\u2022 (A) with H \u2022 (X, c(P )), the Connes-Chern character homomorphism agrees\nwith the twisted Chern character homomorphism constructed in [6], which can\nbe encapsulated as the commutativity of the following diagram,\nK \u2022 (X, P )\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nchP \uf8e6\ny\n\n\u223c\n\n\u2212\u2212=\u2212\u2192 K\u2022 (A)\n\u223c\n\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6ch\ny\n\n(1)\n\nH \u2022 (X, c(P )) \u2212\u2212=\u2212\u2192 HP\u2022 (A).\nWe now outline the paper. In section 2 we first give some standard background\nmaterial on topological algebras and establish a result (Proposition 2.3) that\nwe will need later in the paper. In section 3 we review preliminary material on\ndefining the Hochschild, cyclic and periodic cyclic homology groups HH\u2022 (A),\nHC(A) and HP\u2022(A) respectively for a Fr\u00e9chet algebra A, and the computation of some examples, such as HH\u2022 (L1 ), HC\u2022(L1 ) and HP (L1). In Section\n4, we review the K-theory of such algebras, and specialize to the case of interest for the rest of the paper, namely A = C \u221e (X, L1 (P )), where P is a\nprincipal P U-bundle with Dixmier-Douady class equal to [c] \u2208 H 3 (X, Z), and\nL1 (P ) = P \u00d7P U L1 is the bundle with fibre L1 associated to P via the adjoint action of P U on L1 . We show that the K-theory K\u2022 (A) can be identified\nwith the twisted K-theory K \u2022 (X; P ). We also review the construction of the\nConnes-Chern character ch : K\u2022 (A) \u2192 HP\u2022 (A). In Section 5 we construct,\nfollowing ideas of Gorokhovsky [21,22], a chain map Ch\u2022 : CC\u2022 (A) \u2297 C((u)) \u2192\n\u03a9\u2022 (X) \u2297 C((u)) from the complex CC\u2022 (A) \u2297 C((u)) computing periodic cyclic\nhomology to the twisted de Rham complex (\u03a9\u2022 (X) \u2297 C((u)), d + uc). We remark that the map Ch can be constructed in the formalism of Quillen [32]. In\nTheorem 5.9 we establish that the map Ch\u2022 is a quasi-isomorphism. We also\ndescribe extensions of this result to Hochschild and cyclic homology respectively. The arguments we use here are reminiscent of the \u010cech-de Rham tictac-toe type argument. Finally in Section 6, we prove the commutativity of the\ndiagram (1). We also prove that the Connes-Chern map ch : Ki (A) \u2192 HPi (A)\nbecomes an isomorphism on tensoring with the complex numbers.\n\n3\n\n\fAcknowledgments. It is a pleasure for the authors to thank Joachim Cuntz\nfor his comments and very useful references and Ezra Getzler for his comments\non reading a first draft of the paper and suggesting the elegant rephrasing of\nseveral results in the paper.\n\n2\n\nPreliminaries on Topological Algebras\n\nA Fr\u00e9chet algebra A is an algebra with a complete locally convex topology\ndetermined by a countable family of semi-norms {p\u03b1 } which are required to\nbe sub-multiplicative in the sense that p\u03b1 (ab) \u2264 p\u03b1 (a)p\u03b1 (b). This implies that\nthe multiplication map A \u00d7 A \u2192 A is jointly continuous. We could in fact\nconsider a larger class of algebras, so-called m-algebras for which we refer to\nCuntz's article [13], but for the purposes of this note Fr\u00e9chet algebras will\nsuffice.\nLet us also remark that the unitization \u00c3 of a Fr\u00e9chet algebra A is again a\nFr\u00e9chet algebra. Recall that \u00c3 = A \u2295 C with multiplication given by (a, \u03bb) *\n(b, \u03bc) = (ab + \u03bbb + \u03bca, \u03bb\u03bc). The topology of \u00c3 is determined by the family\nof semi-norms {p\u0303\u03b1 } given by p\u0303\u03b1 (a, \u03bb) = p\u03b1 (a) + |\u03bb|. Similarly the direct sum\nA \u2295 B of two Fr\u00e9chet algebras is again Fr\u00e9chet. One needs to take more care\nin defining tensor products, the tensor product in which we will be exclusively\ninterested in is Grothendieck's projective tensor product \u2297\u03c0 [36]. Recall that\nthis is defined as follows: if A and B are Fr\u00e9chet algebras with countable\nfamilies of semi-norms {p\u03b1 } and {q\u03b2 } then the algebraic tensor product A \u2299 B\nis given a locally convex topology, called the projective tensor product topology,\ndefined by the countable family of semi-norms given by\np\u03b1 \u2297 q\u03b2 (c) = inf{\n\nn\nX\n\np\u03b1 (ai )q\u03b2 (bi )| c =\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nai \u2299 bi }\n\nWe will denote the algebraic tensor product A\u2299B equipped with this topology\n\u02c6 \u03c0 B. A\u2297\n\u02c6 \u03c0 B is again a Fr\u00e9chet\nby A \u2297\u03c0 B and the completion of A \u2297\u03c0 B by A\u2297\nalgebra.\nRecall the well known example of the Fr\u00e9chet algebra C \u221e (X) of smooth functions on a Riemannian manifold X. The seminorms on this algebra are defined\nas follows. Let V be a chart in X and {Kn }n\u2208N be an exhausting sequence of\ncompact subsets of V , i.e., Kn is contained in the interior of Kn+1 and every\ncompact subset of V is contained in some Kn . For f \u2208 C \u221e (X), we denote its\nrestriction to V (and to Kn ) by the same symbol. Then set\npn,V (f ) =\n\nn\nX\n\n1\nsup |\u2202 \u03b1 f (x)|.\nj!\nx\u2208Kn\nj=0\n4\n\n\fwhere the partial derivatives are taken in the chart V . Then varying over\nall charts V and all n \u2208 N, pn,V forms a basis of continuous seminorms for\nC \u221e (X), and the derivation property of the partial derivatives ensures that the\nfamily of semi-norms is sub-multiplicative, giving it the structure of a Fr\u00e9chet\nalgebra.\nAny Banach algebra A is a Fr\u00e9chet algebra with the family of semi-norms\nconsisting of the single norm | * |. In particular we will be interested in the\ncase where A = L1 (H), the Banach algebra of trace class operators on a\nseparable Hilbert space H. We take this opportunity to review some facts\nabout L1 (H). Let H be an infinite dimensional Hilbert space and {vn }, n \u2208 N\nan orthonormal basis of vectors in H. Let B = B(H) denote the bounded\noperators on H. We can define a semi-finite trace on positive elements in B\nby\ntr (x) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(x, vn ).\n\n(2)\n\nn=1\n\nIt turns out that tr (x) is well defined, independent of the choice of orthonormal\nbasis and satisfies tr (x\u2217 x) = tr (xx\u2217 ) for all x \u2208 B. For p \u2265 1, define the\nSchatten class\nLp = {x \u2208 B : tr (|x|p ) < \u221e} .\n\n\u221a\nwhere |x| = x\u2217 x. Then it is well known that Lp is a ideal in B that is\nclosed under taking adjoints, and which is contained in the closed ideal of\ncompact operators K in B. Lp is a Banach \u2217-algebra with respect to the norm\n||x||p = (tr (|x|p ))1/p , but it has no unit. L1 is the Banach \u2217-algebra of trace\nclass operators and L2 the Banach \u2217-algebra of Hilbert-Schmidt operators.\nMoreover, it is the case that the trace map is well defined for arbitrary elements\nof L1 ,\ntr : L1 \u2192 C\n\n(3)\n\nand is given by the same formula (2). Moreover Lp \u2282 Lq whenever p \u2264 q.\nLemma 2.1 Suppose that X and Y are paracompact manifolds. Then one has\na canonical isomorphism,\n\u02c6 \u03c0 C \u221e (Y, L1) \u223c\n\u02c6 \u03c0 L1 ).\nC \u221e (X, L1 )\u2297\n= C \u221e (X \u00d7 Y, L1 \u2297\n\nProof. Recall that the projective tensor product satisfies the following two\nproperties (see for example [36]). If X and Y are smooth manifolds then\n\u02c6 \u03c0 C \u221e (Y ) = C \u221e (X\u00d7Y ) and if E is a Fr\u00e9chet space then C \u221e (X)\u2297\n\u02c6 \u03c0E =\nC \u221e (X)\u2297\n\u221e\nC (X, E), which is the Fr\u00e9chet space of E-valued smooth functions on X.\n5\n\n\f\u02c6 \u03c0 L1 and C \u221e (Y, L1 ) \u223c\n\u02c6 \u03c0 L1 , and\nTherefore C \u221e (X, L1 ) \u223c\n= C \u221e (X)\u2297\n= C \u221e (Y )\u2297\n\u02c6 \u03c0 C \u221e (Y, L1) \u223c\n\u02c6 \u03c0 C \u221e (Y )\u2297\n\u02c6 \u03c0 L1 \u2297\n\u02c6 \u03c0 L1\nC \u221e (X, L1 )\u2297\n= C \u221e (X)\u2297\n\u223c\n\u02c6 \u03c0 L1 \u2297\n\u02c6 \u03c0 L1\n= C \u221e (X \u00d7 Y )\u2297\n\u223c\n\u02c6 \u03c0 L1 ).\n= C \u221e (X \u00d7 Y, L1 \u2297\n\n\u02c6 \u03c0 L1\nRemark 2.2 We caution the reader that the projective tensor product, L1 \u2297\nis not isomorphic to L1 . A similar remark applies when L1 is replaced by Lp\nor by K. This is in contrast to the well known fact that K \u2297 K \u223c\n= K, when the\n\u2217\nC tensor product is applied instead.\nAnother Fr\u00e9chet algebra that we will be interested in is C \u221e (X, L1 (P )), the\nalgebra of smooth sections of a Banach algebra bundle L1 (P ) = P \u00d7P U L1\nwith fibre the algebra of trace class operators L1 associated to a principal\nP U bundle P via the adjoint action of P U on L1 . Here P U = P U(H) is\nthe projective unitary group of H equipped with the norm topology (see\n\u00a74.2 for more details). The trace tr (*) : L1 (H) \u2192 C can be extended fibrewise tr (*) : C \u221e (L1 (P )) \u2192 C \u221e (X), and the algebra of sections C \u221e (L1 (P )) =\nC \u221e (X, L1 (P )) is made into a Fr\u00e9chet algebra as follows. Let V be a chart\nin X and {Kn }n\u2208N be an exhausting sequence of compact subsets of V . For\nf \u2208 C \u221e (X, L1 (P )), we denote its restriction to V (and to Kn ) by the same\nsymbol. Then set\nn\nX\n1\npn,V (f ) =\nsup tr (|\u2207j f (x)|)\nj!\nx\u2208Kn\nj=0\nwhere \u2207j f is the j-th covariant derivative of the section f taken the the\nchart V , \u2207 is a connection on the bundle L1 (P ) which acts as a derivation\non C \u221e (X, L1 (P )) in the sense that \u2207(f h) = f \u2207h + \u2207f h (the existence of\nsuch connections will be established in \u00a75.1.). Then varying over all charts\nV and all n \u2208 N, pn,V forms a basis of continuous seminorms for C \u221e (X),\ngiving it the structure of a Fr\u00e9chet algebra. If \u2207\u2032 is another connection on\nL1 (P ) that is also compatible with the product as above, then \u2207\u2032 defines a\nquasi-isometric family of semi-norms {p\u2032n,V } provided that \u2207 and \u2207\u2032 differ by\na 1-form on X which takes values in the sub-bundle B(L1 (P )) \u2286 End(L1 (P ))\nof bounded endomorphisms of L1 (P ). The derivation property of \u2207 ensures\nthat the family of semi-norms is sub-multiplicative.\nThe following is a generalization of Lemma 2.1 to the case of non-trivial bundles of algebras with fibre L1 and structure group P U.\nProposition 2.3 Suppose that P and Q are principal P U bundles on paracompact manifolds X and Y respectively. Denote by L1 (P ) and L1 (Q) the\nBanach vector bundles on X and Y respectively with fibre L1 associated to P\nand Q via the adjoint action of P U on L1 . Suppose also L1 (P ) and L1 (Q) come\n6\n\n\fequipped with connections \u2207L1 (P ) and \u2207L1 (Q) satisfying the derivation property\nabove. If C \u221e (X, L1 (P )) and C \u221e (Y, L1 (Q)) are equipped with the topologies\ncoming from the families of semi-norms induced by \u2207L1 (P ) and \u2207L1 (Q) , then\nwe have\n\u02c6 \u03c0 C \u221e (Y, L1(Q)) = C \u221e (X \u00d7 Y, L1 (P ) \u22a0 L1 (Q)),\nC \u221e (X, L1 (P ))\u2297\nwhere L1 (P ) \u22a0 L1 (Q) is the algebra bundle over the cartesian product X \u00d7 Y ,\n\u02c6 \u03c0 L1 (Q)y , i.e. modelled on L1 \u2297\n\u02c6 \u03c0 L1 .\nwith fibre (L1 (P ) \u22a0 L1 (Q))(x,y) = L1 (P )x \u2297\nProof. We note first that C \u221e (L1 (P )) \u2299 C \u221e (L1 (Q)) can be identified with a\nsubspace of C \u221e (L1 (P ) \u22a0 L1 (Q)). We will prove two things:\n(1) C \u221e (L1 (P )) \u2297\u03c0 C \u221e (L1 (Q)) \u2282 C \u221e (L1 (P ) \u22a0 L1 (Q)) is a homeomorphism\nonto its image,\n(2) C \u221e (L1 (P )) \u2299 C \u221e (L1 (Q)) is dense in C \u221e (L1 (P ) \u22a0 L1 (Q)).\n\u02c6 \u03c0 C \u221e (L1 (Q)) = C \u221e (L1 (P ) \u22a0\nThis suffices to show the equality C \u221e (L1 (P ))\u2297\nL1 (Q)). To show that C \u221e (L1 (P )) \u2297\u03c0 C \u221e (L1 (Q)) \u2282 C \u221e (L1 (P ) \u22a0 L1 (Q))\nis a homeomorphism onto its image, first of all observe that the inclusion\nC \u221e (L1 (P )) \u2297\u03c0 C \u221e (L1 (Q)) \u2282 C \u221e (L1 (P ) \u22a0 L1 (Q)) is continuous. Now suppose we have a sequence fi in C \u221e (L1 (P )) \u2299 C \u221e (L1 (Q)) which converges to\nzero in the C \u221e (L1 (P ) \u22a0 L1 (Q)) topology. We have to show that fi \u2192 0 in\nthe projective tensor product topology on C \u221e (L1 (P )) \u2299 C \u221e (L1 (Q)). Choose\ngood open covers {U\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208A and {V\u03b2 }\u03b2\u2208B of X and Y respectively and denote\nby L1 (P )\u03b1 the restriction L1 (P )|U\u03b1 and by L1 (Q)\u03b2 the restriction of L1 (Q)|V\u03b2 .\nSince U\u03b1 , V\u03b2 are contractible, the restricted bundles L1 (P )\u03b1, L1 (Q)\u03b2 are trivializable, therefore C \u221e (L1 (P )\u03b1 ) \u223c\n= C \u221e (U\u03b1 , L1 ) and C \u221e (L1 (Q)\u03b2 ) \u223c\n= C \u221e (V\u03b2 , L1 ).\nBy remarks above and by Lemma 2.1, we have the canonical isomorphism\n\u02c6 \u03c0 C \u221e (L1 (Q)\u03b2 ) = C \u221e (L1 (P )\u03b1 \u22a0 L1 (Q)\u03b2 ).\nC \u221e (L1 (P )\u03b1)\u2297\nDenote by r\u03b1 : C \u221e (L1 (P )) \u2192 C \u221e (L1 (P )\u03b1 ), r\u03b2 : C \u221e (L1 (Q)) \u2192 C \u221e (L1 (Q)\u03b2 )\nand r\u03b1,\u03b2 : C \u221e (L1 (P ) \u22a0 L1 (Q)) \u2192 C \u221e (L1 (P )\u03b1 \u22a0 L1 (Q)\u03b2 ) the restriction maps.\nThen we have a commutative diagram\ninc\n\nC \u221e (L1 (P ))\u2297\u03c0 C \u221e (L1 (Q))\n\n/ C \u221e (L1 (P ) \u22a0 L1 (Q))\n||\n\ninc\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n\n\u02c6 \u03c0 C \u221e (L1 (Q))\nC \u221e (L1 (P ))\u2297\nQ\n\nC \u221e (L1 (P ) \u22a0 L1 (Q))\nr\u03b1,\u03b2\n\n\u02c6 \u03c0 r\u03b2 )\n(r\u03b1 \u2297\n\nY\n\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\n\u000f\n\n\u02c6 \u03c0 C \u221e (L1 (Q)\u03b2 )\nC \u221e (L1 (P )\u03b1)\u2297\n\n7\n\n=\n\n/\n\nY\n\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\n\u000f\n\nC \u221e (L1 (P )\u03b1 \u22a0 L1 (Q)\u03b2 )\n\n(4)\n\n\fQ\n\nwhere\ndenotes the direct product.

We shall closely follow the articles of Block and\nGetzler [4] and Cuntz [13]. Let A be a unital algebra over the complex numbers\nC and let CCk (A) = A\u2297k+1 . Define a differential b of degree \u22121 by\nb(a0 \u2297 a1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 ak ) =\na0 a1 \u2297 a2 \u2297 * * * \u2297 ak +\n\nn\nX\n\n(\u22121)j\u22121a0 \u2297 * * * \u2297 aj\u22121 aj \u2297 * * * \u2297 ak\n\nj=2\n\n+ (\u22121)n an a0 \u2297 a1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 ak\u22121 . (5)\nb is defined to be zero on CC0 . The Hochschild homology HH\u2022 (A) is the\nhomology of the complex (CC\u2022 (A), b). This definition extends to the nonunital case as described in Loday [25] pages 29\u201330 by setting\n\u0010\n\nHHn (A) = coker HHn (C) \u2192 HHn (\u00c3)\n\n\u0011\n\nfor a non-unital algebra A, where \u00c3 denotes the unitization of A. If however, A is H-unital, then HHn (A) can be computed from the same complex\n(CC\u2022 (A), b) which computes Hochschild homology in the unital case. Recall\n[25] that A is said to be H-unital if the bar complex Bar\u2022 (A) is contractible.\nThe bar complex has Bark (A) = A\u2297k in degree k with differential b\u2032 given by\n8\n\n\fthe standard formula\nb\u2032 (a0 \u2297 a1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 ak\u22121 ) =\n\nk\u22122\nX\nj=0\n\n(\u22121)j a0 \u2297 * * * \u2297 aj aj+1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 ak\u22121 .\n\nAnother way to compute HHn (A), which works regardless of whether A is\nunital or not, is to use the reduced Hochschild complex which is defined to be\nCC k (A) = \u00c3 \u2297 A\u2297k = A\u2297k \u2295 A\u2297k+1 in degrees k > 0 and CC 0 (A) = A with\ndifferential b given by the obvious extension of the formula (5) above. More\nspecifically, the operator b : CC k+1 (A) \u2192 CC k (A) can be written [13] with\nrespect to the splitting CC k+1 (A) = A\u2297k+1 \u2295 A\u2297k+2 as\n\uf8eb\n\nb=\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8f6\n\nb 1 \u2212\u03bb\uf8f7\n\n0 \u2212b\u2032\n\n\uf8f8,\n\nwhere \u03bb : A\u2297k \u2192 A\u2297k is Connes' signed permutation operator \u03bb(a0 \u2297a1 \u2297* * *\u2297\nak\u22121 ) = (\u22121)k ak\u22121 \u2297 a0 \u2297 * * * \u2297 ak\u22122 . From now on we will write CCk (A) for\nCC k (A). We also introduce Connes' operator B of degree 1 defined by\nB(\u00e30 \u2297 a1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 ak ) =\n\nk\nX\ni=0\n\n(\u22121)ik 1 \u2297 ai \u2297 ak \u2297 a0 \u2297 * * * \u2297 ai\u22121 .\n\nb and B satisfy the identities b2 = B 2 = bB + Bb = 0. We can also write B,\nwith respect to the splitting CCk (A) = A\u2297k+1 \u2295 A\u2297k , as\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8ec 0 0\uf8f7\n\nB=\uf8ed\n\nQ0\n\n\uf8f8\n\nP\n\nwhere Q = kj=0 \u03bbk . Following Block and Getzler, we introduce a variable u\nof degree \u22122. We then define the cyclic homology HC\u2022 (A) of A to be the\nhomology of the complex\n(CC\u2022 (A) \u2297 C((u))/uC[[u]], b + uB)\nwhile the periodic cyclic homology HP\u2022 (A) of A is the homology of the complex\n(CC\u2022 (A) \u2297 C((u)), b + uB).\nNote that the periodic theory HP\u2022 (A) is a Z-graded version of the usual Z/2graded version. In this note we will be concerned with Hochschild, cyclic and\nperiodic cyclic homology defined for topological algebras. Following [11] we\nshall define topological Hochschild, cyclic and periodic cyclic homology for\nFr\u00e9chet algebras A. Suppose that A is a Fr\u00e9chet algebra. Then we form the\n\u02c6 \u03c0 A\u2297\u02c6 \u03c0 k by replacing the ordinary tensor products\nvector spaces CCk (A) = \u00c3\u2297\n\u02c6 \u03c0 of Grothendieck. The\n\u2297 with the completed projective tensor product \u2297\n9\n\n\foperators b and B are all continuous and extend to the completed topological\nvector spaces. We then define HH\u2022 (A), HC\u2022 (A) and HP\u2022 (A) for a Fr\u00e9chet\nalgebra in exactly the same manner as above using the complexes formed by\nreplacing ordinary tensor products with projective tensor products. Clearly\nthe groups HH\u2022 (A), HC\u2022 (A) and HP\u2022 (A) are all functorial with respect to\ncontinuous homomorphisms \u03c6 : A \u2192 B of Fr\u00e9chet algebras. It is also possible\nto define a (topological) bivariant version HP\u2022 (A, B) of periodic cyclic theory\n[16,13,14] however we shall make no use of this.\nFinally, we summarise some key properties of periodic cyclic homology, thought\nof as a functor HP\u2022 from some suitable class of locally convex algebras to the\ncategory of graded abelian groups (we refer to [16,13,14] for more details)\n(HP 1): HP\u2022 is diffeotopy invariant, i.e. if \u03b10 , \u03b11 : A \u2192 B are differentiably ho\u02c6 \u03c0B\nmotopic (so that there exists a continuous homomorphism \u03b1 : A \u2192 C \u221e ([0, 1])\u2297\nwith \u03b1(a)(0) = \u03b10 (a) and \u03b1(a)(1) = \u03b11 (a) for all a \u2208 A) then the induced\nhomomorphisms (\u03b10 )\u2217 , (\u03b11 )\u2217 : HP\u2022 (A) \u2192 HP\u2022 (B) are equal.\n(HP 2): HP\u2022 is stable, i.e. if L1 denotes the trace class operators on a separable\n\u02c6 \u03c0 L1 ) is isomorphic to HP\u2022(A).\nHilbert space H, then HP\u2022 (A\u2297\n(HP 3): HP\u2022 satisfies excision, i.e. if 0 \u2192 A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 0 is an exact\nsequence of algebras which admits a continuous linear splitting, then we have\nthe six-term exact sequence\nHP0 (A) \u2192 HP0 (B) \u2192 HP0 (C)\n\u2191\u03b4\n\n\u2193\u03b4\n\nHP1(C) \u2190 HP1 (B) \u2190 HP1(A)\nOf these, property (HP 2) will be particularly important; we discuss it in more\ndetail in \u00a7 3.3 below.\n\n3.2 The Cyclic Homology of Smooth Functions on a Manifold\nWe will be interested in the Fr\u00e9chet algebra A = C \u221e (X) of smooth functions\non a manifold X. Here the answer was first computed by Connes in [11].\nProposition 3.1 ([11,31]) Let A = C \u221e (X) be the Fr\u00e9chet algebra of smooth\nfunctions on a paracompact manifold X. Then there is an isomorphism between the (continuous) Hochschild homology groups HHn (A) of A and the\ndifferential n-forms \u03a9n (X) on X. The cyclic homology groups HCn (A) can be\n10\n\n\fidentified with\nn\u22122\nn\u22124\nHCn (A) = \u03a9n (X)/d\u03a9n\u22121 (X) \u2295 uHdR\n(X) \u2295 u2 HdR\n(X) \u2295 * * *\nn\u22121\n\nn\n\n0\n1\nwhich terminates in u 2 HdR\n(X) if n is even and in u 2 HdR\n(X) if n is odd.\nev\nn\nodd\nFinally HPn (A) = HdR (X)u if n is even and HPn (A) = HdR\n(X)un if n is\nodd.\n\nIn [11] Connes proved this result under the assumption that X was compact.\nConnes showed that a Kozul complex gave a topological projective resolution\nof A and was able to identify the Hochschild cohomology of A with the space\nof de Rham currents on X. Pflaum [31] later removed the restriction that X\nbe compact. The map \u03c6k : A\u2297k+1 \u2192 \u03a9k (X) defined by\n\u03c6k (a0 \u2297 a1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 ak ) =\n\n1\na0 da1 * * * dak\nk!\n\n(6)\n\ngives a map of complexes \u03c6k from CCk (A) \u2297 C((u))/uC[[u]] to \u03a9k (X) \u2297\nC((u))/uC[[u]] where the latter complex is equipped with the differential ud.\nNote that \u03c6k extends to the completion of CCk (A) in the projective tensor\nproduct topology. Similarly, \u03c6k induces a map of complexes \u03c6k : CCk (A) \u2297\nC((u)) \u2192 \u03a9k (X) \u2297 C((u)). It can be shown that the map \u03c6k induces an isomorphism on the homology of these complexes.\n\n3.3 Topologically H-unital algebras and topological Morita invariance\nIn this section we describe the cyclic homology of the Schatten ideals. We\nbegin with the following Lemma from the thesis [2] of Baehr - for which we\nare very grateful to Joachim Cuntz for making available to us.\nLemma 3.2 Suppose A is a Fr\u00e9chet algebra such that the multiplication map\n\u02c6 \u03c0 A \u2192 A has a continuous left A-linear section s : A \u2192 A\u2297\n\u02c6 \u03c0 A. Then\nm : A\u2297\nA is topologically H-unital.\nThe point is the section s allows one to define a contracting homotopy of the\n(topological) bar complex of A. In particular (following [2]), this allows us to\nprove that L1 is topologically H-unital. To see this, recall that there is an\n\u02c6 \u03c0 H under which the multiplication map corresponds\nidentification L1 = H \u2297\nto the continuous map defined by a \u2297 b 7\u2192 a(u) \u2297 b\u2217 (u) for a fixed unit vector\nu \u2208 H. We define a continuous left L1 -linear section of the multiplication map\nas follows:\n\u02c6 \u03c0 H \u2192 L1 \u2297 L1\ns : L1 = H \u2297\n(7)\nv \u2297 w \u2192 h*, uiv \u2297 h*, wiu\n11\n\n\fwhere h , i denotes the inner product on H. Therefore, one concludes that L1\nis topologically H-unital. We make the remark, following [2], that L1 is not\nalgebraically H-unital since the multiplication map restricted to the algebraic\ntensor product L1 \u2299 L1 is not surjective. Since L1 is topologically H-unital,\none can use the complex CC\u2022 (L1 ) to compute HH\u2022(L1 ), without first having\nto add a unit to L1 . As in [25] we have the trace map tr n : (L1 )\u2297\u02c6 \u03c0 n \u2192 C\u2297\u02c6 \u03c0 n\ndefined by\ntr (A \u2297 B \u2297 * * * \u2297 C) =\n\nX\n\nAi0 i1 \u2297 Bi1 i2 \u2297 * * * \u2297 Cin i0\n\n(8)\n\nwhere the sum is extended over all possible sets of indices. In other words\ntr n (A \u2297 B \u2297 * * * \u2297 C) = tr (AB * * * C). It is easy to check that tr n defines a\nchain map tr \u2022 : CC\u2022 (L1 ) \u2192 CC\u2022 (C). If p is a rank one projection on H with\ntr (p) = 1 then we have a homomorphism inc : C \u2192 L1 which extends to define\na chain map inc\u2022 : CC\u2022 (C) \u2192 CC\u2022 (L1 ). Clearly tr \u2022 \u25e6 inc\u2022 = id. However it is\nalso easy to check that the explicit chain homotopy h from inc\u2022 \u25e6tr \u2022 to id given\nin [25] pages 17\u201318 goes through in this situation. Therefore we conclude that\ntr \u2022 : HH\u2022 (L1 ) \u2192 HH\u2022 (C) is an isomorphism and hence we have the following\ndescription of the Hochschild, cyclic and periodic cyclic homology groups of\nL1 .\nProposition 3.3 ([2,15]) The Hochschild homology groups HHn (L1 ) are all\nzero, except for n = 0 when we have HH0(L1 ) = C. It follows therefore that\nwe have\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2C if n is even\nHCn (L1 ) =\n\uf8f30 if n is odd.\nFinally the periodic cyclic homology groups HPn (L1 ) equal C if n is even and\nare zero if n is odd.\nMore generally, one can show the following\n\u02c6 \u03c0 L1 is topologically HLemma 3.4 If A is a unital Fr\u00e9chet algebra then A\u2297\nunital.\n\u02c6 \u03c0 L1 -linear section is obtained from (7) by extending it AThe continuous A\u2297\nlinearly.

The proof of [25] referred to above\nalso extends to this situation to show that tr \u2022 \u25e6 inc\u2022 = id and inc\u2022 \u25e6 tr \u2022 =\n\u02c6 \u03c0 L1 ) is induced by the homomorphism\nid where inc\u2022 : CC\u2022 (A) \u2192 CC\u2022 (A\u2297\n12\n\n\fa 7\u2192 a \u2297 p where p is a projection of rank one in H, normalised to have trace\ntr (p) = 1.

It\nalso has as a consequence that the trace morphism tr n : HHn (C \u221e (X, L1 )) \u2192\nHHn (C \u221e (X)), when combined with Connes' HKR map (6) above, gives an\nidentification of the Hochschild homology of the algebra C \u221e (X, L1 ) with the\nspace of differential forms on X.\nWe also mention the following result of Cuntz examining the effect in periodic\ncyclic homology of replacing L1 by Lp for p \u2265 1.\n\u02c6 \u03c0 L1 \u2192 A \u2297\n\u02c6 \u03c0 Lp\nProposition 3.7 ([15]) If 1 \u2264 p, then the homomorphism A\u2297\n\u223c\n=\n\u02c6 \u03c0 L1 ) \u2192\ninduced by the inclusion L1 \u0592\u2192 Lp induces isomorphism HP\u2022 (A\u2297\n\u02c6 \u03c0 Lq ) in periodic cyclic homology.\nHP\u2022 (A\u2297\n\u223c\n\n=\nWhen this is combined with Proposition 3.5, we deduce that HP\u2022 (A) \u2192\n\u02c6 \u03c0 Lp ) for all p \u2265 1, and therefore can be viewed as yet another verHP\u2022 (A\u2297\nsion of topological Morita invariance periodic cyclic homology, where the finite\ndimensional matrices are replaced by the topological completion given by Lp .\n\nFor the rest of the paper, we will assume that X is a compact manifold, even\nif not explicitly stated.\nThe following generalizes Lemma 3.4.\nLemma 3.8 Let X be a compact manifold. Then the \u2217-algebra C \u221e (L1 (P )) is\ntopologically H-unital.\n\nProof. Let {U\u03b1 } be an open cover by good open subsets of X, and {\u03c6\u03b1 } be\nP\nbe the\na partition of unity such that \u03b1 \u03c62\u03b1 = 1. Let L1 (P )\u03b1 = L1 (P ))\nU\u03b1\nrestriction, and\nr\u03b1 : C \u221e (L1 (P )) \u2192 C \u221e (L1 (P )\u03b1 )\nbe the induced restriction homomorphism. Let\ni\u03b1 : C \u221e (L1 (P )\u03b1 ) \u2192 C \u221e (L1 (P ))\n13\n\n\fbe defined as i\u03b1 (g) = \u03c6\u03b1 g. Note that i\u03b1 (r\u03b1 (f )g) = f i\u03b1 (g) for f \u2208 C \u221e (L1 (P )).\nBy Proposition 3.5 and Remark 3.6, we know that C \u221e (L1 (P )\u03b1) = C \u221e (U\u03b1 , L1 )\nis topologically H-unital, therefore there is a continuous left C \u221e (L1 (P )\u03b1 )linear section of the multiplication map,\ns\u03b1 : C \u221e (L1 (P )\u03b1 ) \u2192 C \u221e (L1 (P )\u03b1 ) \u2297\u03c0 C \u221e (L1 (P )\u03b1).\nDefine the map\nt\u03b1 : C \u221e (L1 (P )) \u2192 C \u221e (L1 (P )) \u2297\u03c0 C \u221e (L1 (P ))\nas the composition t\u03b1 = (i\u03b1 \u2297i\u03b1 )\u25e6s\u03b1 \u25e6r\u03b1 . Note that t\u03b1 is not quite a section for\nP\nthe multiplication map, instead we have m \u25e6 t\u03b1 = \u03c62\u03b1 t\u03b1 . Now define t = \u03b1 t\u03b1 ,\nso that we get a map\nt : C \u221e (L1 (P )) \u2192 C \u221e (L1 (P )) \u2297\u03c0 C \u221e (L1 (P )).\nIt is easy to check that t is a continuous left C \u221e (L1 (P )) section of the multiplication map, establishing the topological H-unitality of C \u221e (L1 (P )).\n\n4\n\nTwisted K-theory and twisted cohomology\n\n4.1 Twisted K-theory\nLet X be a compact space which comes equipped with a principal P U bundle\nP \u2192 X where P U = P U(H) is the projective unitary group of a separable\nHilbert space H. We will assume that the topology on P U is induced from the\nnorm topology on the full unitary group U = U(H) (this has the advantage\nthat P U acquires the structure of a Banach Lie group, this would not be true\nfor the topology on P U induced from the strong operator topology on U -\nsee \u00a7 4.4 for more details). P U acts by conjugation on the space K = K(H) of\ncompact operators on H. Hence we can form the associated bundle K(P ) and\nconsider the (non-unital) C \u2217 -algebra A = C(K(P )) of continuous sections of\nP \u00d7P U K. The K-theory K\u2022 (A) of the algebra A is called the twisted K-theory\nof the pair (X, P ) [34] and is denoted K i (X, P ). The groups K i (X; P ) are a\nfunctor from the category of spaces equipped with a principal P U bundle to\nthe category of abelian groups. In this respect the groups K i (X; P ) have many\nsimilarities with the groups K i (X), for example there are long exact sequences\nassociated to pairs (X, Y ). In [34] Rosenberg showed that the twisted K-groups\nK i (X; P ) could also be interpreted as vertical homotopy classes of sections of\ncertain bundles of Fredholm operators associated to P . There are alternative\ndescriptions of the groups K i (X; P ) - for example in [6] the twisted Kgroups are interpreted in terms of bundles on P twisted by a gerbe. In [1],\n14\n\n\fanother equivalent definition of twisted K-theory is given, where P U is given\nthe compact open topology instead of the norm topology.\n\n4.2 Smooth subalgebras\nIn this note however we want to study the K-theory of the algebra A from the\npoint of view of non-commutative geometry. We must therefore find a smooth\nreplacement for A. Assume from now on that X is a smooth compact manifold\nand that P \u2192 X is a Banach principal P U bundle (so that P is a Banach\nmanifold).\nWe begin by recalling some generalities on smooth subalgebras of C \u2217 -algebras.\nLet A be a C \u2217 -algebra and Ae be obtained by adjoining a unit to A. Let A be a\n\u2217-subalgebra of A and Ae be obtained by adjoining a unit to A. Then A is said\nto be a smooth subalgebra of A if the following two conditions are satisfied:\n(1) A is a dense \u2217-subalgebra of A;\n(2) A is stable under the holomorphic functional calculus, that is, for any\na \u2208 Ae and for any function f that is holomorphic in a neighbourhood of\ne one has f (a) \u2208 A.\ne\nthe spectrum of a (thought of as an element in A)\n\nAssume that A is a dense \u2217-subalgebra of A such that A is a Fr\u00e9chet algebra with a topology that is finer than that of A. A necessary and sufficient\ncondition for A to be a smooth subalgebra is given by the spectral invariance\ncondition cf. [35, Lemma 1.2]:\ne = GL(A),\ne where GL(A)\ne and GL(A)\ne denote the group of invert\u2022 Ae \u2229 GL(A)\nibles in Ae and Ae respectively.\n\nNow Lp is a dense \u2217-subalgebra of K. Suppose that 1 + a \u2208 L\u0303p is such that\n1 + a \u2208 GL(K\u0303), i.e. there is 1 + b \u2208 GL(K\u0303) such that (1 + a)(1 + b) = 1. Then\na + b + ab = 0, so that b = \u2212a \u2212 ab \u2208 Lp , i.e 1 + b \u2208 GL(L\u0303p ). This shows\nthat Lp is a spectral invariant subalgebra of K. It follows that Lp is a smooth\ndense subalgebra of K.\nLet L1 (P ) = P \u00d7P U L1 be the associated algebra bundle on X (here P U\nacts on L1 by conjugation). Let A = C \u221e (L1 (P )) be the \u2217-algebra of smooth\nsections of L1 (P ), which is made into a Fr\u00e9chet algebra with the topology\ndefined in \u00a72.\nLet A = C(L1 (P )) be the B \u2217 -algebra of continuous sections. A is then a\nsmooth, dense subalgebra of A = C(K(P )). This can be seen as follows. The\nargument given above shows that if 1+a \u2208 \u00c3 is such that 1+a \u2208 GL(\u00c3), then\n1 + a \u2208 GL(\u00c3). Next, a direct generalization of the approximation argument\n15\n\n\fshowing that C \u221e (X) is a smooth dense subalgebra of C(X) shows that A is\na smooth dense subalgebra of A. Combining these observations, we see that\nA is a smooth dense subalgebra of A as desired and it also follows that A is\nstable under the holomorphic functional calculus. Therefore by a result in the\nappendix in [11], (a more detailed proof is given in [5], see also chapter 3, [23])\nthe inclusion map A \u2282 A induces an isomorphism Ki (A) \u223c\n= Ki (A).\n4.3 Connes-Chern character\nRecall how the Connes-Chern character\nch : Ki (A) \u2192 HPi (A)\nis constructed. Let C be a unital \u2217-algebra with unit 1C , and let Proj(C) be\nits set of self-adjoint projections. Two projections P, Q \u2208 Proj(C) are said to\nbe Murray-von Neumann equivalent if there is an element V \u2208 C such that\nP = V \u2217 V and Q = V V \u2217 . Denote Mn (C) \u2297 C = Mn (C), where Mn (C) denotes\nthe square matrices of size n over C. Then Mn (C) is also a \u2217-algebra. Let\nM\u221e (C) = limn\u2192\u221e Mn (C)\uf8ebbe the\ndirect limit of the embeddings of Mn (C) in\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ecT\n\nMn+1 (C) given by T \u2192 \uf8ed\n\n0\uf8f7\n\n\uf8f8. Let V (C) = Proj(M\u221e (C))/ \u223c denote the\n0 0\nMurray-von Neumann equivalence classes of projections in M\u221e (C). Then V (C)\nis an Abelian semi-group under with the operation induced by the direct sum,\nand the associated Abelian group is called the Grothendieck group K0 (C).\nThe homomorphism \u03c0 : C \u2192 C given by \u03bb 7\u2192 \u03bb * 1C induces a homomorphism\n\u03c0\u2217 : K0 (C) \u223c\n= Z \u2192 K0 (C). Then the reduced K-group K\u03030 (C) is defined as\nK\u03030 (C) = coker \u03c0\u2217 \u223c\n= K0 (C)/Z.\n\nNow A is a non-unital \u2217-algebra; let Ae be the unitization of A. By definition,\ne of A.\ne Explicitly, let P, Q\nthe K-group Ki (A) is the reduced K-group K\u0303i (A)\ne such that P \u2212 Q \u2208 M (A).

Isomorphism\nclasses of such bundles on X are in bijective correspondence with H 3 (X; Z).\nTo see this recall that by Kuiper's theorem P U has the homotopy type of\na K(Z, 2) and hence BP U has the homotopy type of a K(Z, 3). Recall that\nwe are considering P U with the topology induced from the norm topology\non U. Recall that U = U(H) is a Banach Lie group (see for example [33]).\nU(1) is a closed subgroup of U and hence P U has a natural structure as\na Banach Lie group. This is not the case for the strong operator topology\non P U; P U equipped with the strong operator topology is an example of a\nPolish group. Note that it is possible to realise BP U as a Banach manifold\n- see [10] for more details. We associate a \u010cech class \u03b4(P ) \u2208 H 3 (X; Z) to a\nprincipal P U bundle P on X by first choosing a good open cover {Ui }i\u2208I of\nX relative to which P has P U-valued transition functions gij (recall that a\ngood cover is one for which every non-empty finite intersection Ui1 \u2229 * * * \u2229 Uip\nis contractible). Choose lifts \u011dij : Uij \u2192 U of gij and define \u01ebijk : Uijk \u2192 U(1)\nby \u011dij \u011djk = \u011dik \u01ebijk . Since U(1) is central in U one can show that \u01ebijk satisfies\nthe \u010cech 2-cocycle condition. Finally we choose maps wijk : Uijk \u2192 R such\nthat exp(2\u03c0iwijk ) = \u01ebijk and define nijkl = wjkl \u2212 wikl + wijl \u2212 wijk . Then nijkl\nis a \u010cech representative for a class \u03b4(P ) \u2208 H 3 (X; Z).\nFreed in [18] gives a very nice construction of a differential 3-form representing\nthe image in de Rham cohomology of the Dixmier-Douady class \u03b4(P ) (note\nthat a similar construction appeared in [20] and in the context of loop groups\nin [29]). We recall his result here, phrased in the language of Michael Murray's\nbundle gerbes [28]. Associated to P is the lifting bundle gerbe L \u2192 P [2] , where\nP [2] = P \u00d7\u03c0 P is the fibre product. Recall that L is the complex line associated\nto the principal U(1) bundle on P [2] obtained by pulling back the universal\nU(1) bundle on P U via the canonical map g : P [2] \u2192 P U. Here g(p1 , p2 )\nfor (p1 , p2 ) \u2208 P [2] is the unique element of P U such that p2 = p1 g(p1 , p2 ).\nThe product on the group U induces a bundle gerbe product on L, i.e. a line\nbundle isomorphism which on fibres takes the form L(p1 ,p2 ) \u2297 L(p2 ,p3 ) \u2192 L(p1 ,p3 )\nfor points p1 , p2 and p3 of P all lying in the same fibre of P over X. A\nbundle gerbe connection on L is a connection \u2207L on the line bundle L which\nis preserved by the bundle gerbe product. Thus if s and t are sections of L then\nwe have \u2207L (st)(p1 , p3 ) = \u2207L (s)(p1 , p2 )t(p2 , p3 ) + s(p1 , p2 )\u2207L (t)(p2 , p3 ). It can\nbe shown that the curvature F\u2207L of a bundle gerbe connection \u2207L can always\nbe written in the form F\u2207L = \u03c01\u2217 f \u2212\u03c02\u2217 f for some 2-form f on P , where \u03c01 and\n\u03c02 denote the projections onto the first and second factors in P [2] respectively.\nIt can also be shown that df is a basic form, i.e. df = \u03c0 \u2217 \u03c9 for some necessarily\n17\n\n\fclosed 3-form \u03c9 on X. For more details we refer to [28]. \u03c9 is a representative\nfor the image in de Rham cohomology of the Dixmier-Douady class \u03b4(P ) of\nP.\nWrite u and pu for the Lie algebras of U and P U respectively. Denote by\nSplit(u, pu) the set of splittings \u03c3 : pu \u2192 u of the central extension of Lie\np\nalgebras iR \u2192 u \u2192 pu. Note that Split(u, pu) is an affine space. P U acts on\nSplit(u, pu) by g * \u03c3 = Ad(\u011d \u22121)\u03c3Ad(g) where \u011d \u2208 U is such that p(\u011d) = g.\nTherefore we can form the associated bundle Split(P ) on X. Since the fibre of\nSplit(P ) is affine we can choose a section which we denote by \u03c3. Observe that a\np\nsplitting s of the projection u \u2192 pu determines a left invariant connection \u03b8\u0302L \u2212\ns(\u03b8L ) on the principal U(1) bundle U \u2192 P U with curvature 12 [s(\u03b8L ), s(\u03b8L )] \u2212\n1\ns[\u03b8L , \u03b8L ] (here \u03b8\u0302L and \u03b8L denote the left Maurer-Cartan forms on U and P U\n2\nrespectively). Clearly then \u03c3 induces a connection on the pullback principal\nU(1) bundle on P [2] and hence a connection \u2207L on the associated line bundle\nL. \u2207L is given locally by \u2207L = d + A\u03b1 where A\u03b1 is the local 1-form \u011d\u03b1\u2217 \u03b8\u0302L \u2212\n\u03c02\u2217 \u03c3(g \u2217 \u03b8L ) (\u011d\u03b1 is a local lift of g : P [2] \u2192 P U to U). The equivariance property\nof \u03c3 under the action of P U shows that \u2207L is a bundle gerbe connection. The\ncurvature F\u2207L of \u2207L is easily computed to be F\u2207L = d\u011d \u2217 \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c02\u2217 d\u03c3(g \u2217 \u03b8). Now\nsuppose we have chosen a connection \u0398 on the principal P U bundle P \u2192 X\nwith curvature \u03a9. A calculation, using the identity g \u2217\u0398 = Ad(g \u22121 )\u0398 + g \u2217 \u03b8L ,\nshows that the 2-form f on P defined by\n1\n1\nf = d\u03c3(\u0398) + [\u03c3(\u0398), \u03c3(\u0398)] \u2212 \u03c3(d\u0398 + [\u0398, \u0398])\n2\n2\n\n(11)\n\nsatisfies F\u2207L = \u03c01\u2217 f \u2212 \u03c02\u2217 f . The results of Murray [28] show that df = \u03c0 \u2217 c(P )\nfor some necessarily closed 3-form c(P ) on X. In fact c(P ) is the push-forward\nof the basic 3-form on P given by\n[\u03c3(\u03a9), \u03c3(\u0398)] \u2212 \u03c3([\u03a9, \u0398]) \u2212 \u03c3 \u2032 (\u03a9)\n\n(12)\n\nwhere we think of \u03c3 as a P U equivariant map P \u2192 Split(u, pu) and denote\nby \u03c3 \u2032 its derivative. c = c(P ) is a de Rham cocycle representative for the\nimage of \u03b4(P ) in real cohomology. For later use we need to know how the\n3-form c depends on the choice of connection \u0398 on P (of course there is also\na dependence on the choice of section \u03c3 but this will not be so important in\nthe sequel). When we want to avoid confusion about the choice of connection\n\u0398 on P used to construct c we will write c = c(\u0398). Any two connections \u0398\nand \u0398\u2032 on P differ by a 1-form A on X with values in the bundle ad P . Let\nf \u2032 be the 2-form (11) constructed from the connection \u0398\u2032 (same choice of \u03c3).\nWe have f \u2032 = f + \u03c0 \u2217 \u03b2 where \u03b2 is the 2-form on X given by\n1\n1\n\u03b2 = [\u03c3(\u0398), \u03c3(A)] \u2212 \u03c3([\u0398, A]) + [\u03c3(A), \u03c3(A)] \u2212 \u03c3([A, A]) + \u03c3 \u2032 (A)\n2\n2\n\n(13)\n\nNote that \u03c3 \u2032 (A) is a scalar valued 2-form and therefore (13) does define a\n18\n\n\f2-form on X. It follows therefore that we have c(\u0398\u2032 ) = c(\u0398) + d\u03b2 on X.\n\n4.5 Twisted Cohomology\n\nIn [6] (see also [19]) it was argued that the Chern character in twisted K-theory\ntook values in a certain 'twisted' cohomology group. If X is a smooth manifold\nthen this group can be defined as follows. Let c = c(P ) be a de Rham cocycle\nrepresentative for \u03b4(P ). Thus c is a closed 3-form on X with integer periods.\nL\nLet \u03a9\u2022 (X) = n=0 \u03a9n (X) denote the graded algebra of differential forms on\nX. As above we introduce a formal variable u of degree \u22122 and consider the\ngraded algebras \u03a9\u2022 (X) \u2297 C((u))/uC[[u]] and \u03a9\u2022 (X) \u2297 C((u)) consisting of\ndifferential forms on X with values in formal power series in the variable u\u22121\nand formal Laurent series in u respectively. We can equip both of these graded\nalgebras with a differential of degree one given by d\u2212uc. Thus this differential\nis a 'twisting' of the ordinary de Rham differential d by exterior multiplication\nwith the closed 3-form c, scaled by the variable u so as to have degree one.\n\nDefinition 1 We call the homology of the complex (\u03a9\u2022 (X) \u2297 C((u)), d \u2212 uc)\nthe twisted de Rham cohomology of X (with respect to c) and denote it by\nH \u2022 (X; c).\n\nIf c changes by a coboundary, c\u2032 = c + d\u03b2, then the complexes (\u03a9\u2022 (X) \u2297\nC((u))/uC[[u]], d \u2212 uc) and (\u03a9\u2022 (X) \u2297 C((u))/uC[[u]], d \u2212 uc\u2032 ) are chain isomorphic through the chain map given by multiplication with eu\u03b2 . Similarly,\nthe complexes (\u03a9\u2022 (X) \u2297 C((u)), d \u2212 uc) and (\u03a9\u2022 (X) \u2297 C((u)), d \u2212 uc\u2032 ) are also\nchain isomorphic through multiplication by eu\u03b2 .\n19\n\n\fIf {Ui }i\u2208I is a good cover of the manifold X then H \u2022 (X; c) can be computed\nfrom the following 'twisted \u010cech-de Rham' double complex\n\n..\n.\nM\ni\n\nM\ni\n\nM\ni\n\n\u2191d\u2212uc\n\n..\n.\n\u03b4\n\n\u03a91 (Ui )((u)) \u2192\n\u2191d\u2212uc\n\n\u03b4\n\n\u03a90 (Ui )((u)) \u2192\n\u2191d\u2212uc\n\n\u03b4\n\n\u03a9\u22121 (Ui )((u)) \u2192\n\u2191d\u2212uc\n..\n.\n\nM\ni<j\n\nM\ni<j\n\nM\ni<j\n\n..\n.\n\n\u2191d\u2212uc\n\n\u03b4\n\n\u03a91 (Uij )((u)) \u2192\n\u2191d\u2212uc\n\n\u03b4\n\n\u03a90 (Uij )((u)) \u2192\n\u2191d\u2212uc\n\n\u03b4\n\n\u03a9\u22121 (Uij )((u)) \u2192\n\u2191d\u2212uc\n..\n.\n\n\u2191d\u2212uc\n\nM\n\ni<j<k\n\nM\n\n\u2191d\u2212uc\n\ni<j<k\n\nM\n\ni<j<k\n\n\u03b4\n\n\u03a91 (Uijk )((u)) \u2192 * * *\n\u03b4\n\n\u03a90 (Uijk )((u)) \u2192 * * *\n\u2191d\u2212uc\n\n(14)\n\n\u03b4\n\n\u03a9\u22121 (Uijk )((u)) \u2192 * * *\n\u2191d\u2212uc\n..\n.\n\nHere by \u03a9n (X)((u)) we mean the elements of \u03a9\u2022 (X) \u2297 C((u)) of total degree\nn, so that \u03a9n (X)((u)) = \u2295p+q=n \u03a9p (X)uq . Associated to this double complex\nare two spectral sequences (corresponding to the two filtrations of the total\ncomplex by rows and by columns) which compute the cohomology of the total complex. If we filter by rows then the E1 term of the associated spectral\nsequence has E10,q = \u03a9q (X)((u)) and E1p,q = 0 for p > 0. Therefore the spectral sequence collapses at the E2 term and computes the twisted de Rham\ncohomology of X. However if we filter by columns then the resulting spectral\nsequence has E2p,q = H p (X)uq for q even and E2p,q = 0 for q odd. Further one\ncan show that the differential d3 : E3p,q \u2192 E3p+3,q\u22122 is cup product with [c]u.\nWe summarise this discussion in the following proposition.\nProposition 4.1 There exists a spectral sequence converging to H \u2022 (X; c) with\nE2p,q = H p (X; C)uq if q is even and E2p,q = 0 if q is odd. The even differentials\nd2r are all zero and the differential d3 : E3p,q \u2192 E3p+3,q\u22122 is cup product with\n[c]u.\nNote that a similar spectral sequence was obtained in [19] by different means.\nRemark 4.2 In this next section, we are going to relate periodic cyclic homology to twisted de Rham cohomology. For this reason we like to think of\ntwisted de Rham cohomology as the homology groups of a complex and we will\ntherefore equip the complex \u03a9\u2022 (X) \u2297 C((u)) with a differential of degree \u22121\ngiven by ud \u2212 u2 c. The only effect of this change is that the homology groups\n20\n\n\fHp (\u03a9\u2022 (X) \u2297C((u))) of the complex \u03a9\u2022 (X) \u2297C((u)) equipped with the differential ud\u2212u2 c) are equal to u times the twisted cohomology groups H p (X, c). For\nthis reason we will still refer to Hp (\u03a9\u2022 (X) \u2297 C((u))) as the twisted de Rham\ncohomology of X.\n\n5\n\nPeriodic Cyclic Homology and Twisted Cohomology\n\n5.1 A Chain Map\n\nIn [21,22] Gorokhovsky introduces the notion of a generalised cycle and defines\nthe character of such an object, which turns out to be a cocycle in the (b, B)bicomplex computing cyclic cohomology. We will use Gorokhovsky's formalism\nto construct a map from the (b, B)-bicomplex computing cyclic homology to\nthe twisted de Rham complex.\nDefine bundles L1 (P ) and B(P ) associated to P via the adjoint action of P U\non L1 and B(H) respectively. From now on let us denote by A the Fr\u00e9chet\nalgebra C \u221e (L1 (P )). Choose a connection \u0398 on the principal bundle P and\nlet c = c(\u0398) be the associated 3-form (12). Define a connection \u2207 on L1 (P )\nby \u2207(s) = ds + [\u03c3(\u0398), s] for a section s \u2208 C \u221e (L1 (P )). \u2207 acts as a derivation\nL\nof degree 1 on the graded algebra \u03a9\u2022 (L1 (P )) = n=0 \u03a9n (L1 (P )) of forms\non X with values in L1 (P ). Let \u03a9 be the curvature of the connection \u0398\non the principal P U bundle P \u2192 X. \u03c3(\u03a9) can be identified as a section\nof the bundle \u03a92 (B(P ))). Since L1 is an ideal in B(H), there is an action of\n\u03a9\u2022 (B(P )) on \u03a9\u2022 (L1 (P )). In particular, \u03c3(\u03a9) acts as a multiplier on the graded\nalgebra \u03a9\u2022 (L1 (P )). Note that \u2207(\u03c3(\u03a9)s) = \u03c3(\u03a9)\u2207(s) \u2212 cs where c acts on s by\nthe obvious action of \u03a9\u2022 (X) on \u03a9\u2022 (L1 (P )). Here c is the 3-form representing\nthe Dixmier-Douady class of the bundle P obtained in (12). Finally observe\nthat the ordinary operator trace tr defines a trace map tr : \u03a9\u2022 (L1 (P )) \u2192\n\u03a9\u2022 (X) satisfying the properties that tr (s1 s2 ) = (\u22121)|s1 ||s2 | tr (s2 s1 ) for s1 , s2 \u2208\n\u03a9\u2022 (L1 (P )) and tr (\u2207(s)) = dtr (s) for all s \u2208 \u03a9\u2022 (L1 (P )).\nDefinition 2 Following Gorokhovsky [21] define a map Chk : CCk (A) \u2192 \u03a9\u2022 (X)\u2297\nC((u)) by the JLO-type formula\nCh(\u00e30 , a1 , . . . , ak ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u2206k\n\ntr (\u00e30 e\u2212s0 \u03c3(\u03a9)u \u2207(a1 ) * * * \u2207(ak )e\u2212sk \u03c3(\u03a9)u )ds1 * * * dsk .\n\n(15)\nNote that Chk is of degree zero. In addition we also put Ch0 (a0 ) = tr (a0 e\n).\n\u2022\nChk extends to a C((u))-module map Ch : CC\u2022 (A)\u2297C((u)) \u2192 \u03a9 (X)\u2297C((u))\nand descends to the quotient to give a map (also written Ch) Ch : CC\u2022 (A) \u2297\nC((u))/uC[[u]] \u2192 \u03a9\u2022 (X) \u2297 C((u))/uC[[u]].

Changing \u0398 to a new connection \u0398\u2032 will change the\ntwisting cocycle c(\u0398) by a coboundary; i.e. c\u2032 = c + d\u03b2 where c\u2032 = c(\u0398\u2032 ) and\nc = c(\u0398) and hence changes the target space of the map Ch.

Then\n\u0398 and \u0398\u2032 are related by a 1-form A with values in the bundle adP : \u0398\u2032 = \u0398+A.\nForm the family of connections \u0398t = \u0398 + tA for 0 \u2264 t \u2264 1. Let \u03a9t denote the\ncurvature of the connection \u0398t . Denote also by ct the 3-form (12) associated\nto the connection \u0398t . The family \u0398t induces a family of connections \u2207t on\nthe bundle L1 (P ) by the same formula as above, \u2207t (s) = ds + [\u03c3(\u0398t ), s] for\ns a section of L1 (P ). We have \u2207t (\u03a9t ) = ct . Define a 2-form \u03b2t on X by the\nformula\n\u03b2t = t([\u03c3(\u0398), \u03c3(A)] \u2212 \u03c3([\u0398, A])) +\n\nt2\n([\u03c3(A), \u03c3(A)] \u2212 \u03c3([A, A])) + t\u03c3 \u2032(A).

Denote by \u2207\n1\non the associated bundle L (P \u00d7 [0, 1]) (we will denote differentiation with\nrespect to t by \u2202t and sometimes by a dot).

Let {Ui }i\u2208I be a good open cover of\nprojective tensor product \u2297\nthe compact manifold X. Let Ai denote the algebra C \u221e (L1 (P )|Ui ) of sections of L1 (P ) over Ui , Aij denote the algebra C \u221e (L1 (P )|Uij ) of sections of\nL1 (P ) over Uij and so on. We can identify the algebra \u2295i Ai with the algebra\n25\n\n\fC \u221e (\u2294L1 (P )|Ui , \u2294Ui ) of smooth sections of the bundle \u2294L1 (P )Ui over the disjoint union \u2294Ui . We can make similar identifications of \u2295Aij and so on.

Suppose that s = (si1 ...ip ) \u2208\n\u2295i1 ,...,ip Ai1 ***ip . Then we put\n\u03b4(s)i1 ***ip+1 = si2 ***ip+1 |Ui1 ***ip+1 \u2212 si1 i3 ***ip+1 |Ui1 ***ip+1 + * * * + (\u22121)p+1 si1 ***ip |Ui1 ***ip+1 .\nAnother way to think of \u03b4 is the following. There are p+1 inclusions \u2294Ui1 ***ip+1 \u2192\n\u2294Ui1 ***ip which induce p + 1 restriction homomorphisms d\u2217i : \u2295i1 ,...,ip Ai1 ***ip+1 \u2192\nP\n\u2295i1 ,...,ip Ai1 ***ip . \u03b4 is then the alternating sum \u03b4 = (\u22121)i d\u2217i . To see that the\nsequence above is exact, suppose that \u03b4(s) = 0. Define t = (ti1 ***ip\u22121 ) \u2208\nP\n\u2295i1 ,...,ip\u22121 Ai1 ***ip\u22121 by ti1 ***ip\u22121 = (\u22121)p ip \u03c1ip si1 ***ip for some partition of unity\n{\u03c1i }i\u2208I subordinate to the open cover {Ui }i\u2208I . For each ip \u2208 I such that\nUi1 ***ip 6= \u2205, (\u22121)p \u03c1ip si1 ***ip defines a section of L1 (P )|Ui1***ip\u22121 . It is then easy to\nsee that \u03b4(t)i1 ***ip = si1 ***ip .\nThis exactness argument generalises for the algebra A\u2297n .

Therefore we are in the situation\nabove with X replaced by X n and the cover {Ui }i\u2208I of X replaced by the\ncover {Ui1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Uin }(i1 ,...,in )\u2208I n of X n . The same partition of unity argument\nused above shows that the sequence is exact. Let us describe in more detail\nthe map \u03b4. First we need some notation. Let us write i = (i1 , . . . , in ) and Ui =\nUi1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Uin .

To prove this we have to show that the map \u03b4 : (\u2295Ai1 ***ip )\u2297n \u2192 (\u2295Ai1 ***ip+1 )\u2297n\nis compatible with the maps b\u2032 , b, \u03bb and B of Section 3 . But b\u2032 , b, \u03bb and B\ncommute with all the homomorphisms d\u2217i and hence commute with \u03b4.\n\nThis Proposition allows us to give a '\u010cech-de Rham style' proof of the following\ntheorem.\nTheorem 5.9 Let X be a compact manifold and let P \u2192 X be a principal\nP U bundle with connection 1-form \u0398.

Therefore for any p \u2265 1 we can form the associated bundle Lp (P ) and the Fr\u00e9chet algebra of smooth sections C \u221e (Lp (P )).\nThe K-theory of the algebra C \u221e (Lp (P )) is the twisted K-theory Ki (C(K(P ))).\nWe can, with very little extra effort, compute the periodic cyclic homology of\nthe algebra C \u221e (Lp (P )) using Theorem 5.9. The inclusion L1 \u0592\u2192 Lp induces\nan inclusion L1 (P ) \u0592\u2192 Lp (P ). Associated to the two algebras C \u221e (L1 (P )) and\nC \u221e (Lp (P )) and the good cover {Ui }i\u2208I of X we have double complexes of the\nform (31). The inclusion L1 (P ) \u0592\u2192 Lp (P ) induces a morphism of these double\ncomplexes. Recall that the inclusion L1 \u0592\u2192 Lp induces an isomorphism on periodic cyclic homology. More generally we have ([13] Corollary 17.2) if U is an\nopen subset of X then the inclusion C \u221e (U)\u2297L1 \u0592\u2192 C \u221e (U)\u2297Lp induces an isomorphism on periodic cyclic homology. Consider the double complexes (31) associated to the algebras C \u221e (L1 (P )) and C \u221e (Lp (P )). If we filter the respective\ntotal complexes by columns then the morphism C \u221e (L1 (P )) \u0592\u2192 C \u221e (Lp (P )) in29\n\n\fduces an isomorphism on the E1 terms of the resulting spectral sequences. It\nfollows then that HPi (C \u221e (L1 (P ))) and HPi (C \u221e (Lp (P ))) are isomorphic.\nCorollary 5.10 For p \u2265 1 the inclusion C \u221e (L1 (P )) \u0592\u2192 C \u221e (Lp (P )) induces\nan isomorphism on periodic cyclic homology.\n\n6\n\nThe Twisted Chern Character\n\nIn this section we relate the Connes-Chern character ch : K\u2022 (A) \u2192 HP\u2022(A) to\nthe twisted Chern character developed in earlier work [6]. Notice that we can\nview ch as a homomorphism chP : K \u2022 (X, P ) \u2192 H \u2022 (X, c(P )) once we notice\nthe identifications K\u2022 (A) \u223c\n= K \u2022 (X, P ) and HP\u2022 (A) \u223c\n= H \u2022 (X, c(P )) where\nthe first isomorphism is established in [34] and the second isomorphism is\nTheorem 5.9.\nWe first observe that the Connes-Chern character ch, or alternatively the\nhomomorphism chP : K \u2022 (X, P ) \u2192 H \u2022 (X, c(P )), becomes an isomorphism after tensoring with the complex numbers. Recall that in general one has no\nassurances that the Connes-Chern map ch : Ki (A) \u2192 HPi (A) will be an isomorphism after tensoring with C for arbitrary algebras A - for example\nKi (C(X)) = K i (X) but HPi (C(X)) = 0 where C(X) is the algebra of continuous complex valued functions on a compact space X. However, in our\nsituation, we can prove the following.\nProposition 6.1 For the algebra A = C \u221e (L1 (P )), the Connes-Chern character ch : Ki (A) \u2192 HPi (A) becomes an isomorphism after tensoring with C,\nfor i = 0, 1.\n\nProof. We prove this Proposition by making repeated use of the MayerVietoris exact sequence (note first that the construction of the Mayer-Vietoris\nsequence given in [3], pages 219\u2013220, goes across to the periodic cyclic theory HP ). First of all choose a cover {B\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208A of X by closed, contractible\nsets B\u03b1 (this can be done using a minor modification of the usual construction of a good open cover by geodesically convex balls). Consider the MayerVietoris sequence for the pair of closed sets {B\u03b1 , B\u03b2 }. Let us write AB\u03b1 and\nAB\u03b1\u03b2 for the algebras C \u221e (L1 (P )|B\u03b1 ) and C \u221e (L1 (P )|B\u03b1\u03b2 ) respectively, where\nB\u03b1\u03b2 = B\u03b1 \u2229 B\u03b2 . Then the Mayer-Vietoris exact sequence for A|B\u03b1\u222aB\u03b2 in Ktheory is\n\u2192 Ki (A|B\u03b1 \u222aB\u03b2 ) \u2192 Ki (A|B\u03b1 )\u2295Ki (A|B\u03b2 ) \u2192 Ki (A|B\u03b1\u03b2 ) \u2192 Ki+1 (A|B\u03b1\u222aB\u03b2 ) \u2192\n(32)\n\n30\n\n\fand there is a similar exact sequence for the periodic cyclic theory. From results\nof Nistor [30], we see that the Connes-Chern map ch furnishes us with a morphism from the exact sequence (32) to the corresponding sequence for HP . We\nknow that ch : Ki (A|B\u03b1 ) \u2192 HPi (A|B\u03b1 ) and ch : Ki (A|B\u03b1\u03b2 ) \u2192 HPi (A|B\u03b1\u03b2 ) become isomorphisms after tensoring with C for all \u03b1 and \u03b2. It follows therefore\nby the 5-lemma that ch : Ki (A|B\u03b1 \u222aB\u03b2 ) \u2192 HPi (A|B\u03b1 \u222aB\u03b2 ) is an isomorphism after tensoring with C. By induction we see that ch : Ki (A) \u2297 C \u2192 HPi (A) \u2297 C\nis an isomorphism.\n\nUpon identifying Ki (A) with K i (X, P ) (see [6]) and HPi (A) with H i (X, c(P ))\n(see Theorem 1.1), we denote the Connes-Chern character ch : Ki (A) \u2192\nf : K i (X, P ) \u2192 H i (X, c(P )). The following Proposition is easy\nHPi (A) by ch\nP\nto establish.\nf : K i (X, P ) \u2192 H i (X, c(P ))\nProposition 6.2 The Connes-Chern character ch\nP\nsatisfies the following properties:\nf\n(1) If the bundle P is trivial (say P is trivialised by a section s) then ch\nP\ni\ni\nreduces to the ordinary Chern character ch : K (X) \u2192 H (X) in the sense\nthat we have the commutative diagram\n\nK i (X, P )\n\u223c\n=\n\neP\nch\n\n\u000f\n\nK i (X)\n\nch\n\n/ H i (X, c(P ))\n\u2217f\n\neus\n\n\u000f\n/ H i (X)\n\nf : K i (X, P ) \u2192 H i (X, c(P )) is natural with respect to maps h : Y \u2192 X\n(2) ch\nP\nin the sense that we have the following commutative diagram\n\nK i (X, P )\nh\u2217\n\n\u000f\n\nK i (Y, h\u2217 P )\n\neP\nch\n\n/ H i (X, c(P ))\n\ne h\u2217 P /\nch\n\n\u000f\n\nh\u2217\n\nH i (Y, h\u2217 c(P )).\n\nIn (1) above, the de Rham cocycle c(P ) is trivialised by s since we have\nc(P ) = ds\u2217 f , where f is the 2-form (11).\nIn [6], a geometric, twisted Chern character was defined,\nchP : K \u2022 (X, P ) \u2192 H \u2022 (X, c(P )),\n\n(33)\n\nusing connections and curvature as well as a curving for the principal P U bundle P , which has the same functorial properties as the Connes-Chern character,\nnamely that is natural with respect to maps and that it reduces to the ordinary\n31\n\n\fChern character when P is the trivial P U bundle. The twisted Chern character also satisfies other functorial properties, such as being compatible with\nthe K 0 (X) module structure of K \u2022 (X, P ) and the H even (X) module structure\nof H \u2022 (X, c(P )), cf. [27]. The analogous properties for the Connes-Chern character can be deduced from the following basic result that identifies the two\nhomomorphisms.\nProposition 6.3 For the algebra A = C \u221e (L1 (P )), the Connes-Chern isomorphism ch : Ki (A) \u2297 C \u2192 HPi (A) \u2297 C coincides with the twisted Chern\ncharacter ismorphism chP : K i (X, P ) \u2297 C \u2192 H i (X, c(P )) \u2297 C for i = 0, 1.\nProof. We follow the strategy of Proposition 6.1. Let {B\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208A be a (finite)\ncover of the compact manifold X by closed balls B\u03b1 such that L1 (P ) is trivialised over B\u03b1 . Consider the Mayer-Vietoris exact sequences in K-theory\nand periodic cyclic homology for the algebra A|B\u03b1 . A choice of local section\ns\u03b1 : B\u03b1 \u2192 P\n= P\u03b1 , trivializes A|B\u03b1 \u223c\n= C \u221e (B\u03b1 ) \u2297 L1 . Using this local\nB\u03b1\nsection, we will have the commutative diagram\n\n\u223c\n\n\u223c\n\n\u223c\n\nK\u2022 (C \u221e (B\u03b1 ) \u2297 L1 ) \u2212\u2212=\n\u2212\u2192 K\u2022 (C \u221e (B\u03b1 )) \u2212\u2212=\n\u2212\u2192 K \u2022 (B\u03b1 ) \u2212\u2212=\n\u2212\u2192\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nch\uf8e6\ny\n\n\u223c\n\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nch\uf8e6\ny\n\n\u223c\n\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nch\uf8e6\ny\n\n\u223c\n\nK \u2022 (B\u03b1 , P\u03b1 )\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\n\nchP\u03b1 \uf8e6\n\nHP\u2022 (C \u221e (B\u03b1 ) \u2297 L1 ) \u2212\u2212=\n\u2212\u2192 HP\u2022 (C \u221e (B\u03b1 )) \u2212\u2212=\n\u2212\u2192 H \u2022 (B\u03b1 ) \u2212\u2212=\n\u2212\u2192 H \u2022(B\u03b1 , c(P\u03b1 ))\n(34)\nwhere the horizontal arrows are all isomorphisms, and the vertical arrows are\nisomorphisms after tensoring with C. The first and second vertical arrows\nstarting from the left are the Connes-Chern isomorphism. The third vertical\narrow is the usual Chern character, which is well known can be identified with\nthe Connes-Chern character on smooth functions on a manifold. The last isomorphism uses the local section again, where s\u2217\u03b1 f = f\u03b1 and s\u2217\u03b1 c = c\u03b1 = df\u03b1 ,\nand the last vertical arrow is the twisted Chern character. The first upper\nhorizontal isomorphism is essentially Morita equivalence. More precisely, one\nuses fact that C \u221e (B\u03b1 ) \u2297 L1 is a smooth subalgebra of C(B\u03b1 ) \u2297 K, so that the\ninclusion map induces an isomorphism in K-theory. Then one uses the invariance of K-theory upon tensoring with the compact operators K. The second\nupper horizontal isomorphism is the Serre-Swan isomorphism, the third is the\nfact the the local section trivializes the P U bundle over B\u03b1 and we use Morita\ninvariance again. The first lower horizontal isomorphism is Morita equivalence, the second is the Connes-Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg isomorphism,\nthe third isomorphism is the fact that the twisted deRham differential is obtained by conjugating the standard one by euf\u03b1 . In summary, a local section\ns\u03b1 : B\u03b1 \u2192 P\n= P\u03b1 gives rise to the commutative diagram,\nB\u03b1\n\n32\n\n\f\u223c\n\n\u2212\u2192\nK\u2022 (A|B\u03b1 ) \u2212\u2212=\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nch\uf8e6\ny\n\n\u223c\n\nK \u2022 (B\u03b1 , P\u03b1 )\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nchP\u03b1 \uf8e6\ny\n\n\u2212\u2192 H \u2022 (B\u03b1 , c(P\u03b1 ))\nHP\u2022 (A|B\u03b1 ) \u2212\u2212=\nwhere the upper horizontal arrow is the isomorphism in [6] and is the result of the composition of the upper horizontal isomorphisms in equation\n(34): the lower horizontal arrow is the generalized Connes-Hochschild-KostantRosenberg isomorphism that is established in this paper, and is the result of\nthe composition of the lower horizontal isomorphisms in equation (34), We\nnext use the Mayer-Vietoris sequence, the 5-lemma and induction as in Proposition 6.1 to establish the proposition.\n\nReferences\n[1] M.
