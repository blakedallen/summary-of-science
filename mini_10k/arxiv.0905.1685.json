Introduction\nIn this paper we investigate interior regularity of viscosity solutions of the parabolic Monge-Amp\u00e9re equation\n(1.1)\n\nut = b(x, t) (det D2 u)p ,\n\nwith exponent p > 0 and with coefficients b which are bounded measurable and\nsatisfy\n(1.2)\n\n\u03bb \u2264 b(x, t) \u2264 \u039b\n\nfor some fixed constants \u03bb > 0 and \u039b < \u221e. We assume that the function u is\nconvex in x and increasing in t.\nEquations of the form of (1.1) appear in geometric evolution problems and in\nparticular in the motion of a convex n-dimensional hyper-surface \u03a3nt embedded in\nRn+1 under Gauss curvature flow with exponent p, namely the equation\n(1.3)\n\n\u2202P\n= Kp N\n\u2202t\n\nwhere each point P moves in the inward direction N to the surface with velocity\nequal to the p-power of its Gaussian curvature K. If we express the surface \u03a3n (t)\n\u2217\u2217 : Partially supported by NSF grant 0701037 and a Sloan Fellowship.\n1\n\n\fPANAGIOTA DASKALOPOULOS\u2217 AND OVIDIU SAVIN\u2217\u2217\n\n2\n\nlocally as a graph xn+1 = u(x, t), with x \u2208 \u03a9 \u2282 Rn , then the function u satisfies\nthe parabolic Monge-Amp\u00e9re equation\n(1.4)\n\nut =\n\n(det D2 u)p\n(1 + |\u2207u|2 )\n\n(n+2)p\u22121\n2\n\n.\n\nSince any convex solution satisfies locally the bound |\u2207u| \u2264 C, equation (1.4)\nbecomes of the form (1.1).\nThe case p = 1 corresponds to the well studied Gauss curvature flow which was\nfirst introduced by W. Firey in [9] as a model for the wearing process of stones. It\nfollows from the work of Tso [15] that uniformly strictly convex hyper-surfaces will\nbecome instantly C \u221e smooth and they remain smooth up to their vanishing time T .\nHowever, convex surfaces which are not necessarily uniformly strictly convex, may\nnot become instantly strictly convex and smooth (c.f. [12], [5]) and their regularity\nposes an interesting problem that we will investigate in this paper.\nEquations of the form (1.3) for different powers of p > 0 were studied by B.\nAndrews in [1] (see also in [6]). He showed that when p \u2264 1/n any convex hypersurface will become instantly strictly uniformly convex and smooth.\nIt can be seen from radially symmetric examples that, when p > 1/n, surfaces\nevolving by (1.3) or (1.1) may have a flat side that persists for some time before\nit disappears. These surfaces are of class C 1,\u03b3p with \u03b3p :=\np>\n\n1\nn\u22121 ,\n\np\nnp\u22121 .\n\nSince \u03b3p < 1 if\n\nsolutions which are not strictly convex fail, in general, to be of class C 1,1\n\nin this range of exponents. In particular, solutions to the Gauss curvature flow\n1\n\n(p = 1) with flat sides are no better than C 1, n\u22121 while the flat sides persist. The\nC 1,\u03b1 regularity of solutions of (1.3) for any p > 0 will be addressed in this work.\nIn dimension n = 2, the regularity for the Gauss curvature flow (p = 1) is\nwell understood. It follows from the work of B. Andrews in [2] that, in this case,\nall surfaces become instantly of class C 1,1 and remain so up to a time when they\nbecome strictly convex and therefore smooth, before they contract to a point. Also,\nit follows from the works of the first author with Hamilton [7] and Lee [8] that C 1,1\nis the optimal regularity here, as can be seen from evolving surfaces \u03a32t in R3 with\nflat sides. The optimal regularity of surfaces with flat sides and interfaces was\nfurther discussed in [7, 8].\nWe mention that C 1,\u03b1 and W 2,p interior estimates were established by Guti\u00e9rrez\nand Huang in [11] for equations similar to (1.1) for p = \u22121 and by Huang and Lu\nfor p =\n\n1\nn.\n\nHowever, their work requires uniform convexity of the initial data and\n\nstrict monotonicity of the function on the lateral boundary.\n\n\fC 1,\u03b1 REGULARITY OF SOLUTIONS TO PARABOLIC MONGE-AMP\u00c9RE EQUATIONS\n\n3\n\nIf w is a solution to the Monge-Amp\u00e9re equation\ndet D2 w = 1,\n\nx \u2208 \u03a9 \u2282 Rn ,\n\nthen u(x, t) = w(x) + t solves equation (1.1) with b \u2261 1 for any p. The question of\nregularity for the Monge-Amp\u00e9re equation is closely related to the strict convexity\nof w. Strict convexity does not always hold in the interior as it can be seen from\na classical example due to Pogorelov [14]. However, Caffarelli [3] showed that if\nthe convex set D where w coincides with a tangent plane contains at least a line\nsegment then all extremal points of D must lie on \u2202\u03a9. We prove the parabolic\nversion of this result for solution of (1.1). Our result says that, if at a time t the\nconvex set D where u equals a tangent plane contains at least a line segment then,\neither the extremal points of D lie on \u2202\u03a9 or u(*, t) coincides with the initial data on\nD (see Theorem 5.3). The second behavior occurs for example in those solutions\nwith flat sides. In other words, a line segment in the graph of u at time t either\noriginates from the boundary data at time t or from the initial data.\nWe prove a similar result for angles instead of line segments, which is crucial for\nour estimates. We show that if at a time t the solution u admits a tangent angle\nfrom below then either the set where u coincides with the edge of the angle has all\nextremal points on \u2202\u03a9 or the initial data has the same tangent angle from below\n(see Theorem 6.1).\nThe C 1,\u03b1 regularity is closely related to understanding whether or not solutions\nseparate instantly away from the edges of a tangent angle of the initial data. It\nturns out that when p >\n\n1\nn\u22122\n\nthe set where u coincides with the edge of the angle\n\nmay persist for some time (see Proposition 4.8), hence C 1 regularity does not hold\nin this case without further hypotheses. If p <\nafter the initial time, solutions are C\n\n1,\u03b1\n\n1\nn\u22122\n\nwe prove that, at any time t\n\nin the interior of any section of u(*, t) which\n\nis included in \u03a9 (see Theorem 8.1). For the critical exponent p =\n\n1\nn\u22122\n\nwe show\n\n1\n\nthat solutions are C with a logarithmic modulus of continuity for the gradient (see\nTheorem 8.2).\nIn the case of any power p > 0 we prove C 1,\u03b1 estimates at all points (x, t) where\nu separates from the initial data (see Theorem 8.4). Also, if we assume that the\ninitial data is C 1,\u03b2 in some direction e then we show that the solution is C 1,\u03b1 in\nthe same direction e for all later times (see Theorem 8.3).\nIn particular, our methods can be applied for solutions with flat sides. If the\ninitial data has a flat side D \u2282 Rn , then solutions are C 1,\u03b1 for all later times in the\n\n\f4\n\nPANAGIOTA DASKALOPOULOS\u2217 AND OVIDIU SAVIN\u2217\u2217\n\ninterior of D. A similar statement holds for solutions that contain edges of tangent\nangles: they are C 1,\u03b1 along the direction of the edge for all later times. To be more\nprecise we state these results below.\nTheorem 1.1. Let u be a viscosity solution of (1.1) in \u03a9 \u00d7 [0, T ] with u(x, 0) \u2265 0\nin \u03a9, u(x, 0) \u2265 1 on \u2202\u03a9. There exists \u03b1 > 0 depending on n, \u03bb, \u039b, p such that\na) u(x, t) is C 1,\u03b1 in x at all points (x, t) with x an interior point of the set\n{u(x, 0) = 0} and u(x, t) < 1.\nb) If u(x, 0) \u2265 |xn | then u(x, t) is C 1,\u03b1 in the x\u2032 variables at all points ((x\u2032 , 0), t)\nwith x\u2032 an interior point of the set {x\u2032 : u((x\u2032 , 0), 0) = 0} and u(x, t) < 1.\nWe finally remark that the equations (1.1) for negative and positive powers are\nin some sense dual to each other. Indeed, if u is a solution of (1.1) and u\u2217 (\u03be, t) is\nthe Legendre transform of u(*, t) then\nu\u2217t = \u2212b\u0303(\u03be, t)(det D2 u\u2217 )\u2212p ,\n\n\u03bb \u2264 b\u0303(\u03be, t) \u2264 \u039b.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we introduce the notation and\nsome geometric properties of sections of convex functions. In sections 3 we derive\nestimates for subsolutions and supersolutions. In section 4 we discuss the separation\nof solutions away from constant solutions such as planes and angles. In sections 5\nand 6 we discuss the geometry of lines and angles. In section 7 and 8 we quantify\nthe results of section 6 and prove the main theorems concerning C 1,\u03b1 regularity.\n2. Preliminaries\nWe use the standard notation Br (x0 ) := {x \u2208 Rn : |x \u2212 x0 | < r} to denote the\nopen ball of radius r and center x0 , and we write shortly Br for Br (0). Also, given a\npoint x = (x1 , * * * , xn ) \u2208 Rn , we denote by x\u2032 the point x\u2032 = (x1 , * * * , xn\u22121 ) \u2208 Rn\u22121 .\nThroughout the paper we refer to positive constants depending on n, \u03bb, \u039b and\np as universal constants. We denote them by abuse of notation as c for small\nconstants and C for large constants, although their values change from line to line.\nIf a constant depends on universal constants and other parameters d, \u03b4 etc. then\nwe denote them by c(d, \u03b4), C(d, \u03b4).\nWe use the following definition to say that a function is C 1,\u03b1 in a pointwise sense.\nDefinition 2.1. A function w is C 1,\u03b1 at a point x0 if there exists a linear function\nl(x) and a constant C such that\n|w(x) \u2212 l(x)| \u2264 C|x \u2212 x0 |1+\u03b1 .\n\n\fC 1,\u03b1 REGULARITY OF SOLUTIONS TO PARABOLIC MONGE-AMP\u00c9RE EQUATIONS\n\n5\n\nA function is C 1,\u03b1 in a set D if it is C 1,\u03b1 at each x \u2208 D.\nA function is C 1,\u03b1 at a point x0 in the direction e if it is C 1,\u03b1 at x0 when\nrestricted to the line x0 + se, s \u2208 R.\nNext we introduce the notion of a section. We denote by Sh (x, t) \u2282 Rn a section\nat height h of the function u at the point (x, t) defined by\nSh (x, t) := { y \u2208 \u03a9 : u(y, t) \u2264 u(x, t) + ph * (y \u2212 x) + h },\nfor some ph \u2208 Rn . Sometimes, in order to simplify the notation, we denote such\nsections as Sh , Sh (t) whenever there is no possibility of confusion.\nWe define the notion of d-balanced convex set with respect to a point.\nDefinition 2.2 (d-balanced convex set). A convex set S with 0 \u2208 S is called dbalanced with respect to the origin, if there exists a linear transformation A (which\nmaps the origin into the origin) such that\nB1 \u2282 A S \u2282 Bd .\nClearly, the notion of d-balanced set around 0 is invariant under linear transformations. Next we recall\nJohn's lemma Every convex set in Rn is Cn -balanced with respect to its center\nof mass, with Cn depending only on n.\nIt is often convenient to consider sections at a point x that have x as center of\nmass. We denote such sections by Th (x, t) instead of Sh (x, t). The existence of\ncentered sections is due to Caffarelli [4].\nTheorem. [Centered sections] Let w be a convex function defined on a bounded\nconvex domain \u03a9. For each x0 \u2208 \u03a9, and h > 0 there exists a centered h-section\nTh (x0 ) at x0\nTh (x0 ) := {w(x) < w(x0 ) + h + ph * (x \u2212 x0 ) }\n(for some ph \u2208 Rn ) which has x0 as its center of mass.\nThe following simple observations follow from the definition of d-balanced sets\nand will be used throughout the paper.\nRemark 2.3. Assume that the h-section of w,\nSh (x0 ) = {w(x) < w(x0 ) + h + ph * (x \u2212 x0 )},\nis d-balanced around x0 . Then,\n\u2212d h < w(x) \u2212 (w(x0 ) + h + ph * (x \u2212 x0 )) < 0,\n\nin Sh (x0 ).\n\n\fPANAGIOTA DASKALOPOULOS\u2217 AND OVIDIU SAVIN\u2217\u2217\n\n6\n\nAlso, if we assume w \u2265 0 and w(x0 ) = 0, then w(x) \u2264 d h for all x \u2208 Sh (x0 ).\nNext lemma proves the existence of certain balanced sections which are compactly included in the domain of definition. It says that if we have a d-balanced\nsection Sh which is compactly included in \u03a9, then we can find Cn d-balanced sections\nfor all smaller heights than h that are included in Sh .\nLemma 2.4. (a) Assume that w is a convex function defined on a set \u03a9 \u2282 Rn\nwith w(0) = 0 such that S1 := {x : w(x) < 1} \u2282\u2282 \u03a9 is d-balanced around 0. Then,\nthere exists a constant Cn > 0 depending only on n, such that for every h < 1 we\ncan find a section Sh at height h with Sh \u2282 S1 and Sh is Cn d-balanced around 0.\n(b) Let us denote by r(x) the volume of the maximal ellipsoid centered at x that\nis included in S1 . Then, there exists a number Cn > 0 such that the section Sh in\npart (a) is either Cn -balanced around 0 or r(x\u2217 ) \u2265 2 r(0) where x\u2217 is the center of\nmass of Sh .\nProof. a) For h < 1 fixed, consider the section Sh at height h that has 0 as its\ncenter of mass. If Sh \u2282 S1 we have nothing to prove. Assume not and let's say\nSh = {w(x) < h + \u03b1 en * x },\n\nfor some \u03b1 > 0.\n\nWe decrease the slope \u03b1 continuously till we obtain the section Sh,t := {w <\nh + t en * x } for which the set\n{ (x, xn+1 ) : x \u2208 S h,t , xn+1 = h + t en * x }\nbecomes tangent to the hyper-plane xn+1 = 1 at a point (x0 , 1). We will show that\nSh,t satisfies (a) and (b).\nClearly Sh,t \u2282 S1 . At the point x0 we have x0 \u2208 \u2202S1 and\nS1 \u2282 {(x \u2212 x0 ) * en \u2264 0 }.\nSince S1 is d-balanced, we may assume that B1 \u2282 S1 \u2282 Bd hence 1 \u2264 x0 * en . Also,\nSh \u2229 {xn = 0} = Sh,t \u2229 {xn = 0}, hence the section Sh,t is already Cn -balanced in\nx\u2032 := (x1 , * * * , xn\u22121 ) around 0.\nSince t \u2264 \u03b1, the center of mass x\u2217 of Sh,t satisfies x\u2217 * en \u2264 0. This together with\nx0 * en \u2265 1 and x0 \u2208 \u2202Sh,t \u2282 B\u0304d , implies that Sh,t is Cn d-balanced around 0 in all\nthe directions.\n\n\fC 1,\u03b1 REGULARITY OF SOLUTIONS TO PARABOLIC MONGE-AMP\u00c9RE EQUATIONS\n\n7\n\nb) If we assume that\n\u2212 x\u2217 * en \u2264 C0 (n) x0 * en\n\n(2.1)\n\nthen we obtain that Sh,t is C(n, C0 (n)) balanced with respect to 0. Assume now\nthat (2.1) doesn't hold and denote by E the maximum volume ellipsoid centered\nat 0 which is included in S1 . After an affine transformation we have the following:\nE = B1 \u2282 S 1 ,\n\nSh,t \u2282 { (x \u2212 x0 ) * en \u2264 0 },\n\nx0 \u2208 \u2202Sh,t\n\nand\n\u2212x\u2217 * en > C0 (n) x0 * en \u2265 C0 (n)\nwhich implies that |x\u2217 | \u2265 C0 (n). Since x\u2217 is the center of mass of Sh,t and 0 \u2208 Sh,t\nwe see from John's lemma that (1+cn ) x\u2217 \u2208 Sh,t \u2282 S1 . Hence if C0 (n) is sufficiently\nlarge we can find an ellipsoid of volume 2 centered at x\u2217 and included in the convex\nset generated by (1 + cn ) x\u2217 and B1 . This convex set is contained in S1 , and this\nconcludes the proof of part (b).\n\n\u0003\n\n3. Estimates for subsolutions and supersolutions\nIn this section we use the scaling of the equation to derive estimates for viscosity\nsubsolutions and supersolutions of\n(3.1)\n\n\u03bb (det D2 u)p \u2264 ut \u2264 \u039b (det D2 u)p ,\n\nx \u2208 \u03a9.\n\nThroughout the paper we assume that u is convex in x, increasing in t and the\ndomain \u03a9 is convex and bounded.\nLet us now introduce the scaling of equation (3.1). Given an affine transformation\nA := Rn \u2192 Rn and h > 0, m > 0 positive constants, the function\nv(x, t) :=\n\n1\nu(A x, m t)\nh\n\nis a solution of equation (3.1) provided\nm=\n\n(det A)2p\n.\nhnp\u22121\n\nThe equation is not affected by adding or subtracting a linear function in x.\nFor this reason we write our comparison results using constant functions instead of\nlinear functions.\n\n\fPANAGIOTA DASKALOPOULOS\u2217 AND OVIDIU SAVIN\u2217\u2217\n\n8\n\nLemma 3.1. Let u be a viscosity subsolution in B1 i.e.\nut \u2264 \u039b(det D2 u)p\nwith\nu(0, 0) \u2265 \u22121,\n\nu(x, 0) \u2264 0 on \u2202B1 .\n\nThen\nu(0, t) \u2265 \u22122\n\nfor t \u2265 \u2212c,\n\nwith c > 0 universal.\nProof. If u(0, \u2212c) \u2264 \u22122 then, by convexity, u at time \u2212c is below the cone generated\nby (0, \u22122) and \u2202B1 i.e\nu(x, \u2212c) \u2264 \u22122 + 2|x|\n\nin B1 .\n\nThis implies that u \u2264 w on the boundary of the parabolic cylinder B1 \u00d7 [\u2212c, 0] for\nw(x, t) := m(t + c) + 2|x|2 \u2212\n\n3\n2\n\nwith m = \u039b4np .\n\nSince wt = \u039b(det D2 w)p we obtain by the maximum principle that u(0, 0) \u2264 w(0, 0)\nand we reach a contradiction by choosing c = 1/(4m).\n\u0003\nRemark 3.2. The conclusion can be replaced by u(0, t) \u2265 \u2212(1 + \u03b4) for t \u2265 \u2212c(\u03b4).\nThe scaling of the equation and the previous lemma give the following:\nProposition 3.3. Assume that u is a viscosity subsolution in a convex set S with\ncenter of mass 0. If\nu(0, 0) \u2265 \u2212h,\n\nu(x, 0) \u2264 0 on \u2202S,\n\nthen\nu(0, t) \u2265 \u22122h\n\nfor\n\nt \u2265 \u2212c\n\n|S|2p\n,\nhnp\u22121\n\nwith c universal.\nProof. From John's lemma there exists a linear transformation A such that\nB1 \u2282 A\u22121 S\n\nwith\n\ndet A \u2265 c(n)|S|.\n\nThe proposition follows by applying Lemma 3.1 to the rescaled solution\nv(x, t) :=\n\n1\nu(Ax, m t),\nh\n\nm=\n\n(det A)2p\n.\nhnp\u22121\n\u0003\n\n\fC 1,\u03b1 REGULARITY OF SOLUTIONS TO PARABOLIC MONGE-AMP\u00c9RE EQUATIONS\n\n9\n\nRemark 3.4. We obtain a slightly different version of Proposition 3.3 by requiring\nS to be only d-balanced around the origin and by replacing the conclusion by\nu(0, t) \u2265 \u2212(1 + \u03b4)h. In this case we need to take the constant c = c(d, \u03b4) depending\nalso on d and \u03b4 as can be seen from the proofs of Lemma 3.1 and Proposition 3.3.\nRemark 3.5. In general we apply Proposition 3.3 at a point (x0 , t0 ) in an h-section\nSh = Sh (x0 , t0 ) which is d-balanced around x0 to conclude that\nu(x0 , t) \u2265 u(x0 , t0 ) \u2212 h\n\nfor\n\nt \u2265 t0 \u2212 c\n\n|Sh |2p\n.\nhnp\u22121\n\nRemark 3.6. At a given point we can apply the Proposition directly in the sections\ngiven by its tangent plane. Indeed, taking S to be the set\nSh = Sh (0, 0) := {u < h + P (x)},\n\nP (x) := u(0, 0) + \u2207u(0, 0) * x\n\nwe conclude that u(x\u2217 , t) \u2265 P (x\u2217 ) \u2212 2h with x\u2217 the center of mass of Sh . This, by\nJohn's lemma, implies a bound in whole Sh\nu(x, t) \u2265 P (x) \u2212 C(n) h,\n\nfor all x \u2208 Sh , t \u2265 \u2212c\n\n|Sh |2p\n,\nhnp\u22121\n\nwith C(n) depending only on the dimension.\nCorollary 3.7. Assume that u is a bounded subsolution of equation (3.1) in the\ncylinder Q1 := B1 \u00d7 [\u22121, 0]. Then, u is uniformly H\u00f6lder continuous in time t on\nthe cylinder Q1/2 := B1/2 \u00d7 [\u22121/2, 0], namely u \u2208 C 1,\u03b2 (Q1/2 ), with \u03b2 = 1/(np + 1).\nProof. Since u is bounded on Q1 , the convexity of u(*, t) implies that |\u2207u| is\nbounded by a constant M in Q3/4 . Then, by Proposition 3.3 applied in Bh (x),\nwith x \u2208 B1/2 and h < 1/4, we have\n(3.2)\n\n\u2212 2M h \u2264 u(x, t) \u2212 u(x, 0) \u2264 0\n\nif \u2212 c\n\n|Bh (x)|2p\n\u2264 t \u2264 0.\nhnp\u22121\n\nTaking t = \u2212c1 hnp+1 , we find that for all t small enough\n|u(x, t) \u2212 u(x, 0)| \u2264 C(M ) t1/(np+1)\nfrom which the desired result readily follows.\n\n\u0003\n\nAs a consequence we obtain compactness of viscosity solutions.\nCorollary 3.8. A sequence of bounded solutions of (3.1) in \u03a9 \u00d7 [\u2212T, 0] has a\nsubsequence that converges uniformly on compact sets to a solution of the same\nequation.\n\n\fPANAGIOTA DASKALOPOULOS\u2217 AND OVIDIU SAVIN\u2217\u2217\n\n10\n\nNext we discuss the case of supersolutions.\nLemma 3.9. Let u be a viscosity supersolution in S \u2282 B1 i.e.\nut \u2265 \u03bb (det D2 u)p\nwith\nu(x, 0) \u2265 \u22121 in S,\n\nu(x, 0) \u2265 0 on \u2202S.\n\nThen\nu(x, t) \u2265 \u2212\n\n1\n2\n\nfor t \u2265 C,\n\nwith C > 0 universal.\nProof. The lemma follows by comparison of our solution u with the function\nw(x, t) =\n\n1\n(|x|2 \u2212 1) + \u03bb (t \u2212 C)\n2\n\non the cylinder S \u00d7 [0, C]. The function w is a solution of the equation wt =\n\u03bb(det D2 w)p and, since S \u2282 B1 , satisfies w \u2264 0 on \u2202S(0) \u00d7 [0, C]. In addition, by\nchoosing C = 1/\u03bb, we have w(x, 0) \u2264 \u22121 \u2264 u(x, 0) for x \u2208 S. The comparison\nprinciple implies u(x, C) \u2265 w(x, C) \u2265 \u22121/2 in S.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.10. We can replace \u22121/2 by \u2212\u03b4 in the lemma above by taking C = C(\u03b4)\ndepending also on \u03b4.\nRemark 3.11. If we assume that S is d-balanced around 0 and u(0, 0) = \u22121,\nu(x, 0) = 0 on \u2202S, then the same conclusion holds by taking C = C(d) depending\nalso on d. Indeed, in this case we obtain u(x, 0) \u2265 \u2212C(d) for all x \u2208 S and the\ndesired conclusion follows as before.\nThe scaling of the equation and the previous lemma give the following:\nProposition 3.12. Let u be a supersolution in \u03a9 and assume\nu(x, 0) \u2265 0,\n\nand Sh := {u(x, 0) < h} \u2282\u2282 \u03a9.\n\nThen\nu(*, t) \u2265\nwith C universal.\n\nh\n,\n2\n\nfor\n\nt\u2265C\n\n|Sh |2p\n,\nhnp\u22121\n\n\fC 1,\u03b1 REGULARITY OF SOLUTIONS TO PARABOLIC MONGE-AMP\u00c9RE EQUATIONS\n\n11\n\nProof. Let A be a linear transformation such that A\u22121 Sh \u2282 B1 so that det A \u2264\nC(n)|Sh |.

In view of Remark 3.11 we obtain a version of Proposition 3.12\nfor sections Sh = Sh (x0 , t0 ) which are d-balanced around x0 and are compactly\nincluded in \u03a9, and conclude that\nu(x0 , t) \u2265 u(x0 , t0 ) + (1 \u2212 \u03b4)h\n\nfor\n\nt \u2265 t0 + C(\u03b4, d)\n\n|Sh |2p\n.\nhnp\u22121\n\n4. Separation from constant solutions\nIn this section we consider the case when the solution u at the initial time t = 0\nis above a given function w depending only on n \u2212 1 variables, u and w coincide\nat the origin, and u > w on \u2202\u03a9. We investigate whether u separates from w\ninstantaneously for positive times, i.e u(0, t) > w(0) for all t > 0. Of particular\ninterest is the case of angles given by w = |xn |.\nThroughout this section we assume that u(x, 0) \u2265 0. For h > 0 we will consider\nthe sub-level set Sh (t) of our solution u(*, t) in \u03a9 which is defined as\nSh (t) := {x \u2208 \u03a9 : u(x, t) < h}.\nWe will also consider balls B\u03c1\u2032 \u2282 Rn\u22121 , namely\nB\u03c1\u2032 := {x\u2032 = (x1 , * * * , xn\u22121 ) \u2208 Rn\u22121 : |x\u2032 | < \u03c1 }.\nProposition 4.1. Let u be a supersolution in \u03a9 \u00d7 [0, T ] with u \u2265 0 at t = 0.\nAssume that Sh (0) \u2229 {xn < 2 \u03b2} is compactly included in \u03a9 and is included as well\nin the cylinder {0 < xn < 2\u03b2} \u00d7 S \u2032 for a bounded domain S \u2032 \u2282 Rn\u22121 and two\npositive constants h > 0, \u03b2 > 0.

We apply Proposition 3.3 for\n\u0169 = u +\n\nh\nxn\n2\u03b2\n\nand see that \u0169 \u2265 u \u2265 0. Also {\u0169(x, 0) < h} is compactly included in \u03a9 and\nis included in {0 < xn < 2\u03b2} \u00d7 S \u2032 .

Let u be a supersolution in \u03a9 \u00d7 [0, T ] and assume that\nu(x, 0) \u2265 w(x\u2032 ) \u2265 0,\n\nu(0, 0) = w(0) = 0,\n\nu(x, 0) > 0\n\non \u2202\u03a9,\n\nfor a function w defined on Rn\u22121 .

Let h > 0 be small such that the sub-level sets Sh (0) of u is compactly\nsupported in \u03a9. Since u \u2265 w we obtain that\nSh (0) \u2282 ({w(x\u2032 ) < h} \u2229 \u03c0n (\u03a9)) \u00d7 [b, \u221e),\nfor some b < 0 (since 0 \u2208 Sh (0)). We apply Proposition 4.1 for hj \u2264 h (hence\nShj (0) \u2282 Sh (0)), with \u03b2 = \u2212b. We conclude that\nShj /4 (tj ) \u2282 {xn > 0},\n\ntj = C\u03b2 2p\n\na2p\nhj\nhnp\u22121\nj\n\n,\n\nand obtain u(0, tj ) \u2265 hj /4 > 0 for a sequence tj \u2192 0.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 4.3. If p > 1/2 and the sequence above is bounded, then the conclusion of\nCorollary 4.2 still holds true.\nNext we investigate the case when w is identically 0.\nProposition 4.4. Let u be a supersolution in \u03a9 \u00d7 [0, T ] with p \u2264 1/n. Assume\nthat u \u2265 0 at t = 0 and u(x, 0) > 0 on \u2202\u03a9. Then, u > 0 in \u03a9 for any t > 0.\nProof. For p < 1/n the proposition follows from Corollary 4.2.\nLet p = 1/n. Assume that for h > 0 small we have Sh (0) \u2282 B\u03c1 for some \u03c1 in\n0 < \u03c1 \u2264 1, and Sh (0) is compactly supported in \u03a9.

Then, since Sh (0) \u2282 B\u03c1 , we\nhave\nSh (0) \u2229 {\u2212\u03c1 < xn < \u2212\u03c1 + 2\u03b2} \u2282 B2\u2032 \u221a\u03b2 \u00d7 (\u2212\u03c1, \u2212\u03c1 + 2\u03b2).\nApplying Proposition 4.1, we obtain that\nSh/4 (t0 ) \u2282 {xn > \u2212\u03c1 + \u03b2},\n\nfor t0 = C (\u03b2 \u03b2\n\nn\u22121\n2\n\n)2/n .\n\nand (4.2) readily follows.\nWe will now use (4.2) to show that u > 0 for t > 0. Let t > 0 and fixed. Choose\n1\n\n\u03b2 := 1/k > 0 with k the smallest integer so that C \u03b2 n \u2264 t, with C the constant\nfrom (4.2).

The geometry of lines\nOur goal in this section is to prove Theorem 5.3, which constitutes the parabolic\nversion of the result of Caffarelli for Monge-Ampere equation. Theorem 5.3 deals\nwith extremal points of the set { u = 0 } for a nonnegative solution u of (3.1) .\nWe begin by giving the definition of an extremal point of a convex set (cf. in [10],\nChapter 5).\nDefinition 5.1. Let D be a convex subset of Rn . The point x0 \u2208 \u2202D is an extremal\npoint of D if x0 is not a convex combination of other points in D.\nWe now give the main results of this section. The first Theorem states that a\nconstant segment in time can be extended backward all the way to the initial data.\nTheorem 5.2. Let u be a solution of equation (3.1) on \u03a9 \u00d7 [\u2212T, 0]. Assume\nu(0, t) = 0 for t \u2208 [\u2212\u03b4, 0] and there exists a section Sh0 (0) := {u(x, 0) < h0 +ph0 *x}\nat (0, 0) that is compactly supported in \u03a9. Then u(0, t) = 0 for all t \u2208 [\u2212T, 0].\nThe second Theorem states that if the graph of u at a given time coincides with\na tangent plane in a set D that has an extremal point in \u03a9, and D contains at least\na line segment, then u agrees with the initial data on D.\nIn other words, a line segment at a given time either originates from the boundary\ndata at that particular time or from the data at the initial time.\nTheorem 5.3. Let u be a solution of equation (3.1) on \u03a9\u00d7[\u2212T, 0], for some convex\ndomain \u03a9 \u2282 Rn . Suppose that at time t = 0 we have u \u2265 0, and the set\nD := { u(x, 0) = 0}\ncontains a line segment and D has an extremal point in \u03a9. Then,\nu(x, \u2212T ) = 0,\n\nfor all x \u2208 D.\n\nAs a consequence of the theorems above we obtain the following:\nCorollary 5.4. Assume u is defined in \u03a9 \u00d7 [\u2212T, 0] and u(x, \u2212T ) \u2265 0 on \u2202\u03a9. Then\nu is strictly convex in x and strictly increasing in t at all points (x, t) that satisfy\nu(x, \u2212T ) < u(x, t) < 0.\nWe first prove Theorem 5.2.\n\n\fC 1,\u03b1 REGULARITY OF SOLUTIONS TO PARABOLIC MONGE-AMP\u00c9RE EQUATIONS\n\n17\n\nProof of Theorem 5.2.

Since u(2en , \u2212t0 ) \u2264 u(2en , 0) = 0, the convexity of u(*, \u2212t0 ) implies that\nu(0, \u2212t0 ) \u2265 \u22122h.

Assume for simplicity that 0 \u2208 \u03a9 is an extremal point for\nD and 2en \u2208 D. We want to prove that u(2en , \u2212T ) = 0.\nFix \u03b4 > 0 small, smaller than a universal constant to be specified later.

In the limit we obtain that 0 can be written as a linear\ncombination of two other points in D (one of them outside B\u03b4 ) and contradict that\n0 is an extremal point.\nFirst we show that u(x, \u2212\u03c3) = 0 on the line segment [0, 2en ]. Using the Holder\ncontinuity of u in t at the point (en , 0) we find that for small t0 > 0,\n1\n\nu(en , \u2212t0 ) \u2265 \u2212h := \u2212C(u)t0np+1 .\nWe can apply Lemma 5.5 inductively and conclude that as long as M k\u22121 t0 \u2264 \u03c3,\n2k\u22121 h \u2264 \u03c3 then\nu(en , \u2212M k t0 ) \u2265 \u22122k h.\nWe choose \u03b4 small enough so that M = 1 + c\u03b4 \u22122p > 4np+1 .

We conclude that u(en , \u2212\u03c3) = 0\nhence u(x, \u2212\u03c3) = 0 on the line segment [0, 2en ].\nNow we can use Theorem 5.2 for the points (sen , 0) for small s \u2265 0 which are\nincluded in a compact section at the origin at time t = 0.

Then convexity in x and\nmonotonicity in t imply u(x, \u2212T ) = 0 on the segment [0, 2en ].\n\u0003\n6. The geometry of angles\nOur goal in this section is to prove the analogue of Theorem 5.3 for angles. That\nis, if u : \u03a9 \u00d7 [\u2212T, 0] \u2192 R is a solution to (3.1) for which the graph of u at time\nt = 0 has a tangent angle from below, then this angle originates either from the\ninitial data u(*, \u2212T ) or from the boundary data on \u2202\u03a9 at time t = 0.\nThroughout this section we will denote by x\u2032 points x\u2032 = (x1 , * * * , xn\u22121 ) \u2208 Rn\u22121\nand by x = (x\u2032 , xn ) points in Rn . Our result states as follows.\nTheorem 6.1. Let u : \u03a9\u00d7[\u2212T, 0] \u2192 R be a solution of equation (3.1) with \u03a9 \u2282 Rn .\nAssume that at time t = 0, we have u(0, 0) = 0, u(x, 0) \u2265 |xn | and 0 is an extremal\npoint for the set D := {x \u2208 \u03a9 : u(x, 0) = 0}. Then, u(x, \u2212T ) \u2265 |xn |.\nThe proof of Theorem 6.1 is more involved than that of Theorem 5.3. We\nintroduce the following convenient notation.\nDefinition 6.2. For negative times t \u2264 0 we say that\n(h, \u03b1) \u2208 At (u) \u2282 R2+\nif there exist vectors q1 , q2 \u2208 Rn such that\nu(x, t) \u2265 u(0, 0) \u2212 h + max {q1 * x, q2 * x}\nin \u03a9 and (q1 \u2212 q2 ) * en \u2265 \u03b1. Whenever there is no possibility of confusion we write\nAt instead of At (u).\nRemark 6.3. The statement (h, \u03b1) \u2208 At is in fact a one-dimensional condition on\nu(x, t). It says that, when restricted to the line sen , we can find a certain angle\nbelow the graph of u(*, t). The vertex of the angle is at distance h below u(0, 0) at\nthe origin and the difference in the slopes of the lines that form the angle is \u03b1.\nClearly, if (h, \u03b1) \u2208 At1 then (h, \u03b1) \u2208 At for all t \u2265 t1 . The statement (h, \u03b1) \u2208\nAt remains true if we add to u a linear function in x or if we perform an affine\ntransformation in the x variable that leaves en invariant.\nNext proposition is the key step in proving Theorem 6.1 and later for obtaining\ninterior C 1,\u03b1 estimates.\n\n\fPANAGIOTA DASKALOPOULOS\u2217 AND OVIDIU SAVIN\u2217\u2217\n\n20\n\nProposition 6.4.

Since\nu0 \u2265 0, and 0 is an extremal point for the set D = {u0 = 0 } we can find (as in\nthe proof of Theorem 5.3) \u03c30 := \u03c30 (u) > 0 small, depending on u, such that if\n0 \u2264 h, t \u2264 \u03c30 then the section\nTh,\u2212t := {u(x, \u2212t) \u2264 h + q * x}\nof u(*, \u2212t) that has x = 0 as center of mass is compactly supported in \u03a9. Thus, by\nJohn's lemma Th,\u2212t is Cn -balanced with respect to the origin.\nLet 0 < \u03b4 < \u03b40 with \u03b40 small universal constant to be made precise later. Without\nloss of generality we may assume that u0 is tangent to |xn | on the line x\u2032 = 0 at\nthe origin, i.e. we have\n(6.3)\n\nlim\n\nxn \u21920+\n\nu0 (0, xn )\n=1\nxn\n\nand\n\nlim\n\nxn \u21920\u2212\n\nu0 (0, xn )\n= \u22121.\nxn\n\nHence, by taking \u03c31 = \u03c31 (\u03b4, u) smaller than \u03c30 , depending also on \u03b4, we can assume\nthat\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b4\nh\u0303, 2 (1 + ) \u2208\n/ A0 ,\n2\n\nfor h\u0303 \u2264 \u03c31 .\n\nChoose h << \u03c31 .

C 1,\u03b1 regularity - I\nIn the next two sections we establish C 1,\u03b1 interior regularity of solutions to\n(3.1). They are based on quantifying the result of Theorem 6.1. In the elliptic case\nC 1,\u03b1 regularity is obtained by a compactness argument. However, in our setting\ncompactness methods would only give C 1 continuity for exponents p \u2264\n\n1\nn\u22122 .\n\nThe\n\nreason for this is that in the parabolic setting it is more delicate to normalize a\nsolution in space and time.\nThe main result of this section is the following Theorem (see Definition 2.1).\nTheorem 7.1. Let u be a solution to (3.1) in \u03a9 \u00d7 [\u2212T, 0] and assume there exists\na section of u(x, 0) which is d-balanced around 0 and is compactly supported in \u03a9.\na)If the initial data u(x, \u2212T ) is C 1,\u03b2 at 0 in the e direction then u(x, 0) is C 1,\u03b1\nat the origin in the e direction with \u03b1 = \u03b1(\u03b2, d) depending on \u03b2, d and the universal\nconstants.\nb) If u(0, 0) > u(0, \u2212T ) then u(x, 0) is C 1,\u03b1 at the origin with \u03b1 = \u03b1(d) depending\non d and the universal constants.\nPart b) will be improved in Theorem 8.4 in which we show that \u03b1 can be taken\nto be a universal constant. As a consequence we obtain Theorem 1.1.\nProof of Theorem 1.1. In view of Remark 2.3, at a point (x, t) for which u(x, t) \u2264\ncn , with cn small depending only on n the centered section Th (x, t) at x, for small\nh, is compactly supported in \u03a9. Clearly u(x, 0) is C 1,1 at an interior point of the\nset {u(x, 0) = 0}.

If cn < u(x, t) < 1 then we can apply directly\nTheorem 8.4 and obtain the same conclusion. The second part of the theorem\nfollows similarly.\n\u0003\nThe following simple lemma gives the relation between the sets At defined in\nDefinition 6.2 and C 1,\u03b1 regularity. Its proof is straightforward and is left to the\nreader.\nLemma 7.2. Let f : R \u2192 R be a convex function with f (0) = 0 and let q be a\nsub-gradient of f at x = 0.

Consider the pairs\n(r1 + s, r2 , r3 \u2212 s),\n(r1 + s, r2 + s \u2212 r3 , 0),\n\nif 0 \u2264 s \u2264 r3\nif s \u2265 r3\n\n\f28\n\nPANAGIOTA DASKALOPOULOS\u2217 AND OVIDIU SAVIN\u2217\u2217\n\nwhere (r1 , r2 , r3 ) comes from the induction step m. When s = 0 the first pair\nbelongs to A\u2212tm , by the induction hypothesis, and when s = sm \u2212 r1 the second\npair doesn't belong to A\u2212tm , since for that choice of s the second pair is\n\u0011\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0010\n\u2212(k\u2212sm )\n/ A\u2212t0\n, (1 + \u03b40 )\u2212\u03b7(k\u2212sm ) \u2208\nC0sm \u2212k , (1 + \u03b40 )\u2212(l+3m\u2212sm ) = C0\n\nfrom the definition of the function \u03b7 given above. Note that for s = r3 the two\n\npairs are the same.\nIt follows that either there exists an s < r3 such that\n(r1 + s, r2 , r3 \u2212 s) \u2208 A\u2212tm\n\nand (r1 + s + 1, r2 , r3 \u2212 s \u2212 1) \u2208\n/ A\u2212tm\n\nor, there exists an r3 \u2264 s < sm \u2212 r1 such that\n(r1 + s, r2 + s \u2212 r3 , 0) \u2208 A\u2212tm\n\nand (r1 + s + 1, r2 + s + 1 \u2212 r3 , 0) \u2208\n/ A\u2212tm .\n\nIn either case we can apply Proposition 6.4. Indeed, the hypothesis (7.2) and\nLemma 2.4 imply the existence of a section Sh of u(*, t) that satisfies ii) in Proposition 6.4 for any h \u2264 1 and any t \u2208 [\u2212T, 0]. More precisely, Sh is Cn d-balanced\nsection around 0 and it is compactly supported in \u03a9. We conclude that either\n(r1 + s + 2, r2 , r3 \u2212 s + 1) for some 0 \u2264 s < r3 or (r1 + s + 2, r2 + s \u2212 r3 , 1) for some\ns \u2265 r3 belongs to A\u2212Mtm . Notice that in both cases the sum of the first and third\ncomponent is less than sm + 3 \u2264 sm+1 . This concludes the proof of the claim.\nThe lemma follows now from the claim above. Since M m0 t0 \u2265 T and\nr1 \u2264 sm0 \u2264 l + 3m0 + C1 (d),\n\nr2 \u2265 0,\n\nwe conclude that\n\u0010\n\nC (d)+l+3m0 \u2212k\n\nC0 1\n\n\u0011\n, (1 + \u03b40 )\u2212l e\u2212\u03b40 \u2208 A\u2212T .\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 7.5. If we assume that hypothesis (7.2) holds only on a smaller interval\nt \u2208 [\u2212T1 , 0] instead of the full interval [\u2212T, 0] then the same conclusion holds by\nreplacing C1 (d) with a constant C1 (d, T /T1 ).\nThe only difference occurs in the inductive step that shows (r1 , r2 , r3 ) \u2208 A\u2212tm ,\nand we have to distinguish whether tm \u2264 T1 or tm > T1 . The case when tm \u2264 T1\nis the same and we obtain tm+1 = M tm as before. In the case when tm > T1 we\napply Remark 6.6 of Proposition 6.4 and obtain tm+1 = tm + M T1 . This second\n\n\fC 1,\u03b1 REGULARITY OF SOLUTIONS TO PARABOLIC MONGE-AMP\u00c9RE EQUATIONS\n\n29\n\ncase occurs at most T /(M T1 ) = C(d, T /T1 ) times and therefore we need to replace\nm0 by m0 + C(d, T /T1 ).\nRemark 7.6. If in the assumption (7.2) we have a constant a instead of 1 i.e\nB d1 \u2282 { x : u(x, 0) < a } \u2282 { x : u(x, \u2212T ) < a } \u2282 B1\nthen the conclusion is the same, except that k \u2265 0 is replaced by k \u2265 C(a) and\nC1 (d) is replaced by C1 (d, a).\nIndeed, \u0169(x, t) :=\n\n1\na\n\nu(x, a1\u2212np t) satisfies the assumptions of the lemma with\n\u2212k+C(a)\n\nt\u03030 = anp\u22121 t0 and T\u0303 = anp\u22121 T and (C0\n\n, (1 + \u03b40 )\u2212l\u2212C(a) ) \u2208 A\u2212t\u03030 (\u0169), hence\n\nthe conclusion of the lemma follows.\nNext we prove Theorem 7.1.\nProof of Theorem 7.1. From the continuity of u we can assume that, after a linear\ntransformation, we have the following situation: u(0, 0) = 0, u(x, \u2212T1 ) > 1 on \u2202\u03a9\nand\n1 \u2282 { u(x, 0) < 1 } \u2282 { u(x, \u2212T1 ) < 1 } \u2282 B1\nB 2d\n\nfor some small T1 \u2208 (0, T ].\nLet k \u2265 0, l be integers such that\n(C0\u2212k , (1 + \u03b40 )\u2212l ) \u2208 A0 .\nIn view of Corollary 7.3 it suffices to show that there exists \u03b5 := \u03b5(d, \u03b2) small\n(or \u03b5 = \u03b5(d) for the second part) such that l \u2265 \u03b5k for all large k.

C 1,\u03b1 regularity - II\nIn this section we prove the main estimates. Let u be a solution defined in\n\u03a9 \u00d7 [\u2212T, 0] and assume that u > l(x) on \u2202\u03a9 \u00d7 [\u2212T, 0] for some linear function l(x).\nWe are interested in obtaining C 1,\u03b1 estimates in x at time t = 0 in any compact set\nK included in the section {u(x, 0) < l(x)}. Theorem 7.1 gives such estimates but\nwith the exponent \u03b1 depending also on the distance from K to \u2202{u(x, 0) < l(x)}\nwhich is not desirable.\nWe can assume that after rescaling we are in the following situation:\n(8.1)\n(8.2)\n(8.3)\n\n\u03bb (det D2 u)p \u2264 ut \u2264 \u039b (det D2 u)p ,\n\nin \u03a9 \u00d7 [\u2212T, 0],\n\n\u03a9 \u2282 B1 (y) for some y \u2208 Rn ,\n\nu > 1 on \u2202\u03a9 \u00d7 [\u2212T, 0],\n\nu0 (x) := u(x, 0) satisfies u0 (0) = 0.\n\nFirst two theorems deal with the case p <\nthe results of Section 3, C\n\n1,\u03b1\n\n1\nn\u22122\n\nand p =\n\n1\nn\u22122 .\n\nIn view of\n\n1\n\n(or C ) continuity is expected for these exponents\n\nregardless of the behavior of the initial data at time \u2212T .\nTheorem 8.1.

We show that\nwe may choose \u03b40 universal in Lemma 7.4 and satisfy the conclusion at a point x\u0303\npossibly different from the origin. The key step is to use the part b) of Lemma 2.4.\nLemma 8.5. Let u : \u03a9 \u00d7 [\u2212T, 0] \u2192 R be a solution of (3.1) such that u > 1 on\n\u2202\u03a9 \u00d7 [\u2212T, 0] and u(0, 0) = 0.

Then, there exists a constant C(j) (depending on universal constants\nand j) such that if k \u2265 0, l are integers and\n(C0\u2212k , (1 + \u03b40 )\u2212l ) \u2208 A\u2212t0\n\nfor some t0 \u2208 (0, T ]\n\nand m0 is an integer satisfying\n3m0 \u2264 k \u2212 l \u2212 C(j),\n\nM m0 t0 \u2265 C(j) T,\n\nthen we can find x\u0303 \u2208 { u(x, \u2212T ) < 1 } such that\nC(j)+l+3m0 \u2212k\n\nu(x, \u2212T ) \u2265 u(x\u0303, \u2212t\u0303) \u2212 C0\n\n+ max{qi * (x \u2212 x\u0303)},\ni=1,2\n\nwith\nt\u0303 = T \u2212\n\nT\nC(j)\n\n(q2 \u2212 q1 ) * en \u2265 (1 + \u03b40 )\u2212l\u2212C(j) .\n\nRemark 8.6. Another way of stating the conclusion of the lemma is that the translation\n(8.4)\n\n\u0169(x, t) := u(x + x\u0303, t \u2212 t\u0303) \u2212 u(x\u0303, \u2212t\u0303),\n\nt\u0303 = T \u2212\n\nT\nC(j)\n\nsatisfies\n\u0010\n\nC(j)+l+3m0 \u2212k\n\nC0\n\n\u0011\n, (1 + \u03b40 )\u2212l\u2212C(j) \u2208 A\u2212T /C(j) (\u0169).\n\nProof. The proof is by induction in j.\n\nThe case j = 1 is proved in Lemma 7.4. Indeed, since B1/2 \u2282 E \u2282 B1 (y) \u2282 Bd/2\nwe see that the hypothesis (7.2) is satisfied and the conclusion holds for x\u0303 = 0.\nFor a general j we start the proof as before. The only difference here is that we\ncannot guarantee in the induction step m \u21d2 m + 1 that there exists a section at\ntime \u2212tm = \u2212M m t0 which is Cn d = Cn2 balanced around the origin.\nLet's assume this fails for a first integer m. By Lemma 2.4 we can find a C1 (j)balanced section (with C1 (j) > Cn2 ) at the time \u2212tm . The idea is to apply Proposition 6.4 as in the induction step and then to \"replace\" the origin with the center\nof mass x\u2217 of this section. To be more precise, by Remark 6.7, the translation\n\u0169(x, t) = u(x\u2217 + x, t \u2212 tm ) \u2212 u(x\u2217 , \u2212tm )\nsatisfies\n\nwith\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\nC2 (j) C0r1 \u2212k , (1 + \u03b40 )r2 \u2212l e\u2212\u03b40 \u2208 A\u2212t\u03030 (\u0169)\nt\u03030 := c1 (j) tm = c1 (j) M m t0\n\n\fC 1,\u03b1 REGULARITY OF SOLUTIONS TO PARABOLIC MONGE-AMP\u00c9RE EQUATIONS\n\n33\n\nand from (7.4)-(7.6)\nr1 \u2264 3m + r2 ,\n\n0 \u2264 r2 \u2264 l + C3 (j).\n\nHere we assumed that T > tm + t\u03030 , otherwise the proof is the same as before by\ntaking x\u0303 = 0, and there is no need to change the origin. Notice that m0 > m if\nC(j) > 1/c1 (j).\nThe above imply\n(C0\u2212k\u0303 , (1 + \u03b40 )\u2212l\u0303 ) \u2208 A\u2212t\u03030 (\u0169)\nwith\nl\u0303 := l \u2212 r2 + C1\n\nand k\u0303 = k \u2212 (3m + r2 ) \u2212 C4 (j).\n\nNow we apply the induction (j \u2212 1)-step for \u0169. First we set\nm\u03030 := m0 \u2212 m\n\nand T\u0303 := T \u2212 tm ,\n\nand we have T\u0303 \u2265 t\u03030 \u2265 c1 (j)tm \u2265 c2 (j) T .\nBy Lemma 2.4 the maximal ellipsoid centered at the origin and included in the set\n{ \u0169(x, 0) < \u00e3} has volume greater than 2j\u22121 |B1 |.
