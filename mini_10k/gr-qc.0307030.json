Ferretti\nDipartimento di Fisica dell'Universit\u00e0 di Bologna, Italy\nAbstract. After a preliminary discussion of the relevance of the field nature of gravitation interaction, both for the fundamental interaction of particles and the topology of\nspace time, a method is proposed to produce and detect a dynamical gravitational field,\nallowing the determination of the order of magnitude of its propagation velocity.\nI Introduction\nFrom the actual point of view of the physicist the structure of space and time is\nmerely depending on two fields: the electromagnetic and the gravitational fields. On\nthe other hand mathematically electromagnetism is entirely described inside the Poincar\u00e9\ngroups (enlarged Lorentz group), i.e. in the ambit of the special relativity, whereas the\ngravitational field requires the consideration of the larger set of transformation of general\nrelativity.\nFor this and others more subtle reasons our knowledge of electromagnetism from one\nside and of gravitation from the other presents itself in a quite different way.\nThe very notion of field has been introduced by Faraday in the ambit of his theory of\nelectromagnetism, and formalized then by Maxwell. Electromagnetic waves as such have\nthen been produced and seen in laboratory by Hertz. Eventually it has been seen that\nelectromagnetic waves of Hertz's length are produced in nature and that such waves fill\nthe universe.\nIn the meantime a lot of very important things were happening in Physics: the atomic\ntheory of matter was put on new more solid basis, the electron and the nuclei of the atoms\nwere discovered and most important quantization was discovered.\nTo the purposes of our discussion we have to notice that the only force which had to\nbe considered to give a completely (with the exclusion of few \"minor\" details) satisfactory\ntheory of the structure of the atoms, molecules, solids and so on was the electromagnetic\nforce.\nEven later, when nuclear physics and physics of elementary particles were becoming of\nuttermost importance, new forces and new fields were hypothesized, but always neglecting\nthe gravitational forces. Gravitation was considered instead only in the ambit of cosmology,\nastronomy and geophysics.\nThere was however the fundamental progress made by Einstein (see Ref. [1] and [1']),\nwho introduced the new idea that gravitational forces and inertial forces were manifestations of the same field. This new idea allowed the generalization of the special relativity.\n1\n\n\fThis generalization was on the other hand badly needed to allow the consistency of relativity with many important facts of physics.\nThe introduction of general relativity had no immediate effects on high energy physics.\nIn this ambit the Heisenberg S matrix theory, with the very valid help of the renormalization techniques, was of paramount importance. With this approach questions about\nwhat really was happening at very small distances were considered not well defined. Unfortunately, let us say it incidentally, even what we should consider \"a small distance\" was\nnot well defined.\nBut even with this simplification, difficulties (for instance about not renormalizability\nof certain fields) were persisting, and different S matrix models had to be considered.\nBetween these models was Veneziano's model (see Ref. [2]) in which, as far as I know,\nfor the first time an infinite number of \"elementary particles\" was introduced; furthermore\nthe masses of these particles were going up to infinite. On the other hand, as in that time\nusual, gravitational interaction was completely neglected. I noticed almost immediately\nthat the model couldn't be consistent, because an elementary particle had to be considered\nas having the simplest structure, and if its mass was m, its radius had to be rC \u2243 h\u0304/mc\n(Compton's radius). Let K be the universal gravitation constant. The gravitational self\nenergy of an elementary particle of mass m should then be:\nEK =\n\nKm2\nKc 3\nKm2\n=\n=\nm .\nrC\nh\u0304/mc\nh\u0304\n\nTherefore the gravitational self energy EK for an elementary particle had to increase with\nthe cube of the mass: that was meaning that gravitation interaction couldn't any more be\nneglected in the theory of elementary particles.\nOn the contrary, with a sufficiently high mass the gravitational self energy becomes\nequal to the total self energy of the particle. That happens if\nr\nKc 3\nh\u0304c\n2\nmc =\nm ,\ni.e. if\nm =\n\u2243 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 g .\nh\u0304\nK\nThe \"elementary particle\" therefore becomes a very small black hole. It should be\nnoticed that the corresponding Compton's radius is\nrC =\nThis distance\n\n10\u221227\nh\u0304\n=\n\u2243 2 \u00d7 10\u221233 cm .\nmc\n2 * 10\u22125 \u00d7 3 * 10\u221210\n\nrP =\n\nr\n\nh\u0304K\nc3\n\nhad been introduced in physics, about fifty years before I \"rediscovered\" it, by Planck\nwho wanted to form three \"natural\" units of length, time and mass by mean of universal\nconstants only, whereas I was thinking about the elementary particles.\n2\n\n\frP was merely the \"natural unity of length\" of Planck. I confess that just I ignored the\nthing. In that time I was working in the theoretical division of CERN. Of course I started\nto talk with my colleagues theoreticians of my reflexion about the model of Veneziano.\nNow to my knowledge nobody had mentioned the idea that gravity might be important in\nthe theory of elementary particles up to that time; after one year it was common place.\nOn my side my attention was particularly attracted by the idea that gravitation might\nbe very important to determine the structure of space-time and not only at great distances\nas suggested by the general relativity theory, but also at very small distances determining\nthere the space-time topological structure.\nI started then to investigate theoretically which might be the influence of gravitation\non high precision measurements at very small distances (see Ref. [3], [4], [5]). During this\ninvestigation I convinced myself that it was probably essential to consider, as in general\nrelativity, gravitation as a field of forces. On the other hand I was more and more impressed\nby the fact that the direct experimental evidence of this assumptions is up to now missing.\nDuring the second half of the last century a search of the gravitational waves coming\nfrom space up to now has not given any sure positive results (see Ref. [6]).\nRecently evidence of a finite velocity propagation of gravitation was obtained by astronomical measures (see Ref. [7], [8]).\nOn the other hand, due to the smallness of the gravitational constant, the enterprise\nof detecting the propagation of a dynamical (i.e. varying in time) gravitational field in the\nlaboratory, like made by Hertz on the electromagnetic waves, appears to be rather difficult.\nOne might even wonder whether it is worthwhile. What could we learn from it?\nShould for instance we be able to measure their velocity of propagation, might we expect\nsomething different from the velocity of light? For restricted relativity reason, that would\nbe unthinkable. But for this very reason, should we be able to measure the finite velocity\nof propagation of the gravitational field, it would be imperative to do it.\nI decided therefore to investigate the possibility of what I have called an Hertzian\nenterprise about gravitation. This is the object of the present paper.\nII\n\nA suggestion about the possibility of producing and revealing gravitational\nwaves allowing the determination of the order of magnitude of their propagation velocity\n\nII A The general scheme of the suggested experiment\nThe experimental apparatus will include a certain number of \"radiators\" of gravitation\nand of \"detectors\". In general the radiators will be rotating bodies and the frequency of\nrotation will be the same for all (1 ). As a consequence, the gravitational potential in the\nspace surrounding the radiators will be, as a function of time, analyzable in Fourier series.\n(1 ) My attention was called on two interesting papers (see Ref. [9], [10]) in which use was\nmade of rotating radiators of gravity. The aim of these papers was a search of a force due\n3\n\n\fIf on the other hand the detector is finely tuned on the frequency of the considered\nFourier component, it becomes possible to get a \"zero measurement\" of the velocity of\npropagation.\nThis is the fundamental idea underlaying our suggestion.\nII B The expression of the gravitational field gravity following general relativity\nin the limit of small velocity of the gravitating bodies\nLet\nds2 =\n\n(B1)\n\nX\n\ng\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd\n\n\u03bc,\u03bd\n\nbe the metric of space-time in the reference [1] and [1'].

[1']) the term \u2212\n2 \u2202x24\nlimit was omitted. That was perfectly consistent with the approximations performed to\nthe purpose. In our case however, as we shall see, the term in question is essential.\nIn the passage from equation (B7) to equation (B8) we neglected\n3\nX\n\u2202 \u2202\u03b4gl4\n,\n\u2202xl \u2202x4\nl=1\n\nas the \u03b4gl4 are presumably very small. Indeed all components of the gravitational field\ndifferent from g44 are always neglected in all astronomical calculations. Shouldn't be\ncorrect, just an experiment as that we suggest would put it in evidence.\nOn the other hand, considering again the equation (B6), T\u03bc\u03bd is the tensor of energy\nand momentum of the gravitation field and of the matter. Eventually we get for the\ngravitational potential the equation:\n1 1 \u22022\n1\n1 2\n\u2207 g44 \u2212\ng44 = \u03ba\u033a ,\n2\n2\n2\n2 c \u2202t4\n2\n\n(B9)\n\n1\n4\u03c0K\n\u03ba =\n, where K is the\n2\nc2\n\u22128\nNewtonian gravitational\nconstant and has the value 6.673(10) \u00d7 10\nin C.G.S. units\n\u0001\ncm3 g\u22121 s\u22122 .\n\nwhere \u033a is the density of the gravitating matter and\n\n1 1 \u22022\ng44 , the solution of (B9) cannot anymore be the Newton\n2 c2 \u2202t24\ngravitational potential, but for instance:\nNow, due to the term\n\n\u03a6(t \u2212 r/vg ) = \u2212K\n\nZ \u033a(x\u2032 , y \u2032 , z \u2032 , t \u2212 r/v )\ng\nr\n\nsupposing that the velocity of propagation is vg .\n6\n\ndx\u2032 dy \u2032 dz \u2032 ,\n\n\f\u03a6(t \u2212 r/vg ) differs from the former usual Newton potential by a correction of the time\nin the density \u033a(x\u2032 , y \u2032 , z \u2032 , t\u2032 ) of gravitating matter for the retardation due to the velocity\nof propagation. For consistence with Eq. B9, this velocity vg is expected to be just the\nvelocity of light.\nThe chief object of the suggested research should be to put in evidence this correction,\nand it is just a correction of this kind which characterizes fields against action at distance.\nII C The simple radiator\nSchematically our radiator consists of two equal bodies R1 , R2 of equal masses MR\nmade of the same substance, for instance iron, having the same geometrical form (sphere),\nwith the centers of gravity laying in G1 and G2 on the same horizontal plane at a distance\n2a and rotating around a vertical axis passing by the middle point O of G1 , G2 . We suppose\nthat a is much greater than the radius of the spheres R1 , R2 .\nThe frequency of rotation will be \u03bd hertz (turns by second), and consequently the\ncentrifugal force acting on each body and due to the rotation will be:\nFC = (2\u03c0\u03bd)\n\n2\n\nZZZ\n\n\u03be 2 + \u03b72\np\nd\u03bed\u03b7d\u03b6 \u2243 (2\u03c0\u03bd)2 MR a ,\n\u03c3\n2\n2\n\u03be +\u03b7\n\nwhere \u03c3 is the density of the rotating body, \u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6 the Cartesian coordinates (\u03be, \u03b7 the\nhorizontal, \u03b6 the vertical) of the particles of the body, and a must be much greater than\nthe linear dimension of the body.\nFor instance, if a = 100 cm, MR = 1000 kg = 106 gr, \u03bd = 1 hertz:\nFC \u2243\n\n\u0001\n(2\u03c0)2 \u00d7 106 \u00d7 100 dyn \u2243 4 \u00d7 109 dyn = 4 \u00d7 104 N .\n\nThe centrifugal forces are equal and opposite and the equilibrium shall be kept by a\ntension bundle of steel wires, or, to get a symmetrical arrangement, a ring of steel and\ncarbon fibers.\nWe can use cylindrical coordinates \u033a, \u03c6, \u03b6 of center O, (middle point of G1 , G2 ), being\n\u03be = \u033a cos \u03c6, \u03b7 = \u033a sin \u03c6 and \u03c6 = 2\u03c0\u03bdt + \u03c8/2. The dependence on time is totally contained\nin \u03c6. The other parameters are time independent.\nNow, if x, y, z are the Cartesian coordinates of a given point P (for instance of the\ndetector), the distance between P and Q (a point of the rotating body) is given by:\nr =\n\np\n(x \u2212 \u03be)2 + (y \u2212 \u03b7)2 + (z \u2212 \u03b6)2 .\n\nWe assume that the points P all belong to a small neighbourhood of a point P0 of\ncoordinates\n\n(C1)\n\nx 0 = r0 ,\n\ny0 = 0 ,\n7\n\nz0 = 0 ;\n\n\fand therefore\nx = r0 + \u2206x ,\n\ny0 = 0 + \u2206y ,\n\nz0 = 0 + \u2206z ;\n\nwhere\n\u2206x2 + y 2 + z 2\n\u226a 1.\nr0 2\n\n(C1\u2032 )\n\nSimilarly \u03be = a cos \u03c6 + \u2206\u03be, \u03b7 = a sin \u03c6 + \u2206\u03b7, \u03b6 = 0 + \u2206\u03b6.\nIt follows that we can write\n2\n\n2\n\nr 2 = (r0 \u2212 a cos \u03c6 + \u2206x \u2212 \u2206\u03be) + (\u2212a sin \u03c6 + \u2206y \u2212 \u2206\u03b7) + (\u03b6 \u2212 \u2206z)\n= r02\n\n(\u0012\n\n\u2206x \u2212 \u2206\u03be\na\ncos \u03c6 +\n1\u2212\nr0\nr0\n\n\u00132\n\n2\n\n=\n\n\u00132 \u0012\n\u00132 )\n\u0012\n\u2206y \u2212 \u2206\u03b7\na\n\u03b6 \u2212 \u2206z\n.\n+ \u2212 sin \u03c6 +\n+\nr0\nr0\nr0\n\nSupposing that the inequality (C1') is very strong, we can write:\n\n(C2)\n\nr 2 = r02\n\n(\u0012\n\n)\n\u00132 \u0012\n\u00132\na\na\ncos \u03c6 +\nsin \u03c6 + small terms\n1\u2212\nr0\nr0\n\nand neglecting the small terms, eventually we get:\n\n(C3)\n\nr2\n\n(\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012 \u00132 )\na\na\n.\n1 \u2212 2 cos \u03c6 +\n= r02\nr0\nr0\n\nWe notice that, if the rotating bodies R1 and R2 are regular spheres and the mass of\nthe bundles are negligible, corrections due to \u2206\u03be, \u2206\u03b7, \u2206\u03b6 are exactly zero.\nNow our radiator consists schematically of two bodies R1 , R2 , and if for R1 we have:\n\uf8f1\n\u03c6 = \u03c61 = 2\u03c0\u03bdt + \u03c8/2 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u001a\n\u0010 \u00112 \u001b\na\n\uf8f4\n2\n2\n\uf8f3 r1 = r0 1 \u2212 2 r cos (2\u03c0\u03bdt + \u03c8/2) + ra\n;\n0\n\n0\n\ncorrespondingly for R2 we have:\n\uf8f1\n\u03c62 = \u03c61 + \u03c0 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u001a\n\u0010 \u00112 \u001b\na\n2\n2\n\uf8f4\n.\n\uf8f3 r2 = r0 1 + 2 r cos (2\u03c0\u03bdt + \u03c8/2) + ra\n0\n\n0\n\n8\n\n\fWe can also write:\n\uf8f1 2\nr1 = r02 \u2212 2ar0 cos \u03c6 + a2 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nr22 = r02 + 2ar0 cos \u03c6 + a2 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u03c6 = 2\u03c0\u03bdt + \u03c8/2 .\n\n(C3\u2032 )\n\nThe gravitational potential \u03a6(x, y, z, t) created by the radiator in P (with our approximation and neglecting for the moment the retardation) is given by\n\n(C4)\n\n\u03a6 = \u2212KMR\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1\n+\nr1\nr2\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\nIn order to calculate \u03a6 as given by (C4) we could use the expansion in multipoles, as\ncommonly in potential\ntheory, or, in an equivalent way, the expansion in powers of \u03be of\n\u221a\nthe function 1/ 1 + \u03be :\n\n\u22121/2\n\n(1 + \u03be)\n\nn\u22121\nY\n\n3 \u03be2\n1\n1\n+ . . . + (\u22121)n n\n= 1\u2212 \u03be+ 2\n2\n2 2!\n2\n\n(2l + 1)\n\nl=1\n\n!\n\n\u03ben\n+ ...\nn!\n\nWe can write:\n\nr1,2 =\n\nq\n\nr2\n0\n\n\u2213 2ar0 cos \u03c6 +\n\na2\n\n=\n\nq\n\nr02\n\n+\n\na2\n\ns\n\n1\u22132\n\n\u0012\n\nar0\n2\nr0 + a 2\n\n\u0013\n\nar0\n2\nr0 + a 2\n\n\u00132m\n\ncos \u03c6 ,\n\nso, in our case:\n\u03be1,2 = \u2213 2\n\n\u0012\n\nar0\nr02 + a2\n\n\u0013\n\ncos \u03c6 .\n\nIt follows therefore:\n\n1\n2\n1\n+\n= p\n(C5)\nr1\nr2\nr02 + a2\n\n(\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n1\n1+\n(2m)!\nm=1\n\n2m\u22121\nY\n\n(2l + 1)\n\nl=1\n\n!\u0012\n\n)\n\ncos2m \u03c6\n\n.\n\nNow, as we have suggested in IIA, we want to use the Fourier expansion of the gravitational potential.

Precisely we want, as said in sect. IIA, to get a zero\nmeasurement of the velocity of propagation.\nTo this purpose we should have two different simple radiators designed in such a\nway to produce on the detector two Fourier components of gravitation forces of the same\namplitude differing only in the respective phases.\nWe call these two simple radiators \u03b1 whose mass, radius and distance are M\u03b1 , a\u03b1 and\nr0\u03b1 , and \u03b2 whose mass, radius and distance are M\u03b2 , a!\u03b2 and r0\u03b2 .\n\u0012\n\u0013\na\u03b1 r0\u03b1\na\u03b2 r0\u03b2\nFirst we impose that\n=\nto get F1 (a\u03b1 , r0\u03b1 ) = F1 (a\u03b2 , r0\u03b2 ),\n2\n2\n2\nr0\u03b1 + a\nr0\u03b2 + a2\nM\u03b2\nM\u03b1\nand eventually 2 = 2 , because we have to compare the forces and not merely the\nr0\u03b1\nr0\u03b2\npotentials.\nIn this way the values of the relevant Fourier components will essentially depend only\nfrom the phases \u03c6\u03b1 and \u03c6 .\n\u03b2\nSuppose that the two simple radiators produce on the detector two Fourier components\n\u03c0\nof the same amplitude A and phases respectively \u03c6\u03b1 and \u03c6 . Let \u03c6 = \u03c6\u03b1 + + \u2206\u03c6,\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n2\nand suppose m = 1 for the considered Fourier component, then the total force acting (with\nthe correct frequency) on the detector will be:\n\b\n\u0001\nA{cos 2\u03c6\u03b1 + cos 2\u03c6 } = A cos 2\u03c6\u03b1 + cos 2\u03c6\u03b1 + \u03c0 + 2\u2206\u03c6\n\u03b2\n\n,\n\nand it will be zero if \u2206\u03c6 = 0.\n\nWe suppose that the detector is a harmonic oscillator with negligible damping, and\ntherefore that it will resonate exactly at a very precise frequency. This can allow the \"zero\nmeasurement\" of which in section IIA and it is on the other hand grounded on the remark\nI of section IIC.\nAs a consequence of the preceding consideration we suggest that the measurement\nsetup should consist of one detector and two radiators, one small (\u03b1) near the detector\nand the bigger (\u03b2) at a greater distance.\nThe constants a, r0 , M of the two radiators should be chosen in in such a way that\nthe respective Fourier amplitudes of the gravitational forces be equal.\nWe shall work in mode m = 1, and, if \u03c6\u03b1 is the potential of the near radiator \u03b1 and\n\u03c6 that of the far radiator \u03b2, we have, supposing that the velocity of propagation is vg :\n\u03b2\n\uf8f1\n\u2206\u03c6\u03b1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u03c6\u03b1 = 2\u03c0\u03bdt \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212\n,\n\u00132\n\u0012 2\nr\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u03c6 = 2\u03c0\u03bd t \u2212 v0\u03b2 .\n\u03b2\ng\nThen:\n\n15\n\n\f2\u03c6\u03b1 = 4\u03c0\u03bdt \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u2206\u03c6\u03b1 ,\n\u2206\u03c6\u03b1 \u226a 1 ,\n!\n4\u03c0\u03bdr0\u03b2\nr0\u03b2\n= 4\u03c0\u03bdt \u2212\n,\n2\u03c6 = 4\u03c0\u03bd t \u2212\n\u03b2\nvg\nvg\n4\u03c0\u03bdr0\u03b2\nis the shift that should be measured (clearly we expect vg = c) ;\nvg\n\u0001\ncos 2\u03c6\u03b1 = \u2212 cos 4\u03c0\u03bdt \u2212 \u2206\u03c6\u03b1 = \u2212 cos 4\u03c0\u03bdt cos \u2206\u03c6\u03b1 \u2212 sin 4\u03c0\u03bdt sin \u2206\u03c6\u03b1 =\nn\n\u00012 o\n\u2212 sin 4\u03c0\u03bdt sin \u2206\u03c6\u03b1 ,\n= \u2212 cos 4\u03c0\u03bdt 1 + O \u2206\u03c6\u03b1\n!\n4\u03c0\u03bdr0\u03b2\ncos 2\u03c6 = + cos 4\u03c0\u03bdt \u2212\n=\n\u03b2\nvg\n\nwhere\n\n4\u03c0\u03bdr0\u03b2\n4\u03c0\u03bdr0\u03b2\n\u2212 sin 4\u03c0\u03bdt sin\n=\nvg\nvg\n\uf8f1\n!2 \uf8fc\n\uf8f2\n4\u03c0\u03bdr0\u03b2\n4\u03c0\u03bdr0\u03b2 \uf8fd\n;\n\u2212 sin 4\u03c0\u03bdt sin\n= + cos 4\u03c0\u03bdt 1 + O\n\uf8fe\n\uf8f3\nvg\nvg\n\n= + cos 4\u03c0\u03bdt cos\n\n!\n\u00012\n4\u03c0\u03bdt\ncos 2\u03c6\u03b1 +cos 2\u03c6 = + sin 4\u03c0\u03bdt sin\n\u2212 sin \u2206\u03c6\u03b1 +O \u2206\u03c6\u03b1 +O\n\u03b2\nvg\n\n4\u03c0\u03bdr0\u03b2\nvg\n\n!2\n\n.\n\nIt is very important to remark that in the experimental condition which we suggested,\nwe can make a capital use of the fact that the energy of the detector will increase with\nthe square of the time of irradiation (see D8) (at least until the damping of the detector\nis negligible). This fact will allow the detection of a very small signal.\nIf we measure the value of \u2206\u03c6\u03b1 /2, for which the Fourier component m = 1 of the\nmotion of detector is equal zero, we have the velocity of propagation (presumably c).\nWe can then summarize the measurement procedure in the following way. There are\ntwo clearly distinct steps.\nLet us write the Fourier component for m = 1 of the signal of the radiator \u03b1 as\nA\u03b1 sin \u03c6\u03b1 , and that of the radiator \u03b2 as A\u03b2 sin \u03c6\u03b2 .\nThe first step consists in obtaining with maximum possible precision that A\u03b1 = A\u03b2 .\nTo this purpose we measure the total signal on the detector as a function of the initial\nphase \u03c6\u03b10 . We modify by successive attempts for instance M\u03b1 , until the minimum of the\nsignal becomes equal zero. When this condition is obtained we have A\u03b1 = A\u03b2 .\nThe second step consists then in trying to measure \u03c6\u03b10 \u2212 \u03c0/2 with the maximum\nprecision.\nShould the retardation be zero (action at distance!), then \u03c6\u03b10 \u2212 \u03c0/2 = 0 , but in the\nreality \u03c6\u03b10 \u2212 \u03c0/2 is different from zero, and its measure (as already pointed out in sect\n16\n\n\fIIA) will give the possibility of determining the velocity of propagation of the gravitation\nfield.\nII F A numerical example\nWe give now a numerical example for the case of a preliminary experiment (see concluding remarks).\nLet us recall (E1).

IID it seems then not to be impossible to\nperform the experiment.\n17\n\n\fIII Concluding remarks\nSupposing that the preceding considerations are not all nonsense, it is my opinion\nthat the next step should be experimental in nature and it should concern the detector.\nOf course one or two radiators of modest size should be prepared to test the detectors.\nBut they are the first objects to be designed in detail.\nThe singular qualities that the detectors should have require a preliminary research\nthat shouldn't be however too costly. Only if it will be possible to reach a favourable\nconclusion, it would be reasonable to think to the more substantial part of the investigation.\nIn order to carry out this task, I suggest to build a radiator R\u03c4 consisting of two\n\"identical\" simple radiators.\nThese radiators, that we call \"arms\" R\u03b1 and R\u03b2 of R\u03c4 , will rotate coaxially. The\nangle \u03b8\u03b1,\u03b2 between R\u03b1 and R\u03b2 shall be adjustable and measurable with precision.\nIn general, if the frequency of rotation is \u03bd, the frequency of the irradiated field will\n\u03c0\nbe 2\u03bd, but when \u03b8\u03b1,\u03b2 =\nit will be 4\u03bd.\n2\nThe test of this fact shall be our task.\nAcknowledgments\nI want to thank S. Turrini for his helpful assistance in writing this work. Discussions\nwith S. Bergia, E. Picasso, L.A. Radicati and E. Remiddi are also gratefully acknowledged.\nEventually I want to thank A.
