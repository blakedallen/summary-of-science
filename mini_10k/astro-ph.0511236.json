The velocity\nstructure of the X-ray absorber is consistent with the velocity structure measured in the simultaneous UV spectra. In the X-rays we can separate the highest outflow velocity component, \u22121040 km s\u22121 , from the other velocity components. This velocity component spans at least\nthree orders of magnitude in ionization parameter, producing both highly ionized X-ray absorption lines (Mg\nXII, Si XIV) and UV absorption lines. A similar conclusion is very probable for the other four velocity components. We show that the lower ionized absorbers are not\nin pressure equilibrium with the rest of the absorbers. Instead, a model with a continuous distribution of column\ndensity versus ionization parameter gives an excellent fit\nto our data.\n\n2003) and Steenbrugge et al. (Steenbrugge et al., 2003)\nconcluded that there is substantially more lowly ionized\ngas than has been claimed from previous UV observations. It was concluded that the X-ray and UV warm\nabsorbers are different manifestations of the same phenomenon.\n\n2.\n\nOBSERVATION AND DATA REDUCTION\n\nKey words: AGN, Seyfert 1, NGC 5548, X-ray spectroscopy.\n\nThe XMM-Newton RGS data was reduced using the standard threads of the SAS version 5.3. For the Chandra\nHETGS data we used the threats in CIAO version 2.2. For\nthe LETGS the 1.5 event file was obtained using CIAO\nversion 2.2, but further data reduction was done using the\npipeline described by Kaastra et al. (2002a), which includes an empirical correction for the known wavelength\nproblem in the LETGS and fitted it with responses that\ninclude the first 10 positive and negative orders. The\ndata were analyzed using the spex package (Kaastra et al.,\nin press).\n\n1.\n\n3.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOver half of all Seyfert 1 galaxies exhibit signatures of\nphotoionized outflowing gas in their X-ray and UV spectra. Studying these outflows is important for a better\nunderstanding of the enrichment of the Inter Galactic\nMedium (IGM) as well as the physics of accretion of gas\nonto a super-massive black hole. Arav et al. (Arav et al.,\n\nVELOCITY STRUCTURE\n\nThe five velocity components measured in the UV\n(Crenshaw et al., 2003) are listed in Table 1.

This clearly indicates that this velocity\ncomponent spans an ionization range of at least 3 orders\nof magnitude, from low ionization UV lines to Si XIV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nSRON National Institute for Space Research is supported\nfinancially by NWO, the Netherlands Organization for\nScientific Research.\n\nREFERENCES\nArav, N., Kaastra, J., Steenbrugge, K., et al. 2003, ApJ,\n590, 174\nCrenshaw, D.

The\ntwo lowest ionized components measured from the X-ray\nspectra cannot be in pressure equilibrium with the higher\nionized components. This means that if the absorber is\ndue to clouds in an outflow, they need to be magnetically\nconfined. An equally good fit to the spectra is obtained\nwith a continuous ionization parameter distribution, i.e.\nan outflow with a density gradient (Steenbrugge et al.,\n2005). The lowest ionization component measured in the\nX-rays has a very similar ionization parameter as the ionization parameter measured from UV spectra: log \u03beX\u2212ray\n= \u2212 0.03 versus log \u03beUV = 0.05. However, most of the\ngas is highly ionized. Assuming a continuous outflowing stream, we derive a power law slope for the column\ndensity of 0.4 with ionization parameter.\n\nKaastra, J.
