The reheating of the postinflationary universe [1] the dynamics of symmetry breaking [2]\nand the formation and decay of cosmological defect networks [3] as well as the phase transitions in the early universe\n[4] with possible relic gravitational waves [5] are just some of the examples that require the study of out-of-equilibrium\nfields in a cosmological context. Similarly, the rapid thermalisation of the hot quark-gluon plasma [6, 7] and its driving\nmechanisms, such as the Weibel instability [8] raise questions in the realm of nonequilibrium field theory.\nOne of the simplest and most popular strategies to describe an out-of-equilibrium field theory is the classical approximation. It has been extensively used for reheating models of the early Universe [9] and also for predicting the\ncorresponding production of gravitational waves [10]. Other cosmological applications include electroweak baryogenesis [11, 12] as well as theories accomodating non-fundamental strings [13] or domain walls [14, 15], where the\nnonperturbative treatment is essential. The extreme excitation of the gluon field in a heavy ion collision has also\nmade the classical strategy applicable and very successful at early times after a collision [16, 17].\nThe success of classical field theory indicates that many of the interesting phenomena in high energy physics are\nactually classical. Indeed, genuine quantum effects play little role if the classical modes are highly excited, and these\nclassical fluctuations can play the role of quantum particles. In order for the classical approach to work the UV\nmodes must remain unexcited to avoid Rayleigh-Jeans divergences. In fact, this restricts the classical treatment to\nfar-from-equilibrium settings, and the classical dynamics automatically drives the system out of its range of validity\nin the course of equilibration.\nIt is still possible to split the momentum space of a theory into different momentum regions, where hard degrees\nof freedom follow a quantum-mechanically correct Hard Thermal Loop (HTL) dynamics to some finite perturbative\norder, while the infrared part follows the classical non-perturbative dynamics [18, 19]. This allows a kinetic description\n[20, 21] for the hard modes in terms of a Vlasov equation [22]. The interplay between classical waves and particles can\ngive account for non-trivial dynamics, such as the development of plasma instabilities [23, 24]. In this way one can\navoid the problem of ultraviolet divergences, but the scale separation is not always natural, especially if the coupling\nis not small.\nA step towards the inclusion of quantum corrections from first principles is the Hartree approximation [25, 26]. It\nassumes a constantly Gaussian density operator and allows to account for quasi-particles propagating in arbitrary\ninhomogeneous backgrounds, which can be as complicated as a network of topological defects [27, 28]. Although it\ncompletely neglects the scattering of the quasi-particles on each other, non-perturbative particle creation mechanisms,\nlike tachyonic instability [29] or parametric resonance [30] are within its range of validity. Renormalisation in this\nframework has already been discussed at length [31]. Despite of its simplicity and clean formulation the fact that\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: email: s.borsanyi@sussex.ac.uk\nof this research has been carried out at Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, UCSB, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA.\n\u2021 Electronic address: email: reinosa@cpht.polytechnique.fr\n\n\u2020 Part\n\n\f2\nthermalisation can not be described in this way [32, 33] explains why this approximation scheme could not reach a\nwide acceptance.\nThe two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective action provides a first principles approach to quantum field theory\n[34, 35]. The systematic approximations, obtained from any small parameter expansion of the 2PI effective action,\nusually resum an entire series of ladder diagrams which in turn play a particularly important role in solving the\nsecularity problem of out-of-equilibrium perturbation theory. This type of resummation is also present in the KadanoffBaym equations [36] as well as in Boltzmann equations [37]. It has been shown that the first nontrivial truncation\nof the 2PI effective action beyond two-loop order already provides a sufficient framework to describe thermalisation\nin scalar theories [38, 39, 40, 41, 42] as well as in a model with fermions [43]. The 2PI effective action has become\na standard framework for nonequilibrium quantum field theory [44], at present, with mostly scalar applications of\ncosmological interest [45, 46, 47].\nThe success of these practical applications has also encouraged more formal investigations on the very foundations\nof the 2PI (and more generally nPI [48]) approach. To be considered as a sensible approach, the latter should\nlead to approximations which reflect, as much as possible, the basic properties of quantum field theories. The\nthermodynamical consistency as well as the energy conserving nature of the time evolution have already been known\n[49]. Understanding how global and local symmetries appear at the level of the 2PI effective action has been studied\nin [50, 51]. Because some important aspects of the dynamics of hot gauge theories require a 3PI analysis [52, 53],\napplications have also shifted focus to higher nPI effective actions [54, 55, 56, 57]. For low orders, however, (e.g. for\nthe truncation used in this paper) any higher nPI effective action yields the equation of motion what one also finds\nin 2PI [54].\nAnother important issue is renormalisation. So far, the latter has been considered in equilibrium for scalar [50,\n58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63], fermionic [64] as well as abelian gauge fields [65]. However, no similar studies exist so far\nout-of-equilibrium beyond Hartree approximation, and most applications were based on cut-off theories defined in\nterms of bare parameters. In this work, we intend to fill this gap and show how renormalisation results obtained in\nequilibrium could be used out-of-equilibrium. For illustration, we consider a scalar (\u03bb/4!)\u03c64 theory but our approach\ncould be extended to other theories of relevance.\nIn Sec. II, we recall basic definitions and results in equilibrium. Special attention is paid to the equivalence between\ndifferent contours in the truncated 2PI framework, which we use later on. In Sec. III we move on to out-of-equilibrium\nsituations and point out the relevance of beyond-Gaussian initial conditions for continuum field theories. We suggest a\nself-consistent initial condition and study the corresponding time evolution in the 2PI three-loop approximation. Our\nnumerical results strongly suggest the existence of a continuum limit for such initial conditions, unlike what happens\nwith Gaussian initial conditions. Appendices C and D collect the algorithms used to obtain the results in Sec. III.\nII.\n\nEQUILIBRIUM QUANTUM FIELD THEORY\n\nIn this section we consider a real scalar field in equilibrium at a temperature T = 1/\u03b2. In this context, one is usually\ninterested in determining thermal expectation values of products of field operators ordered along a given time contour\nC. In Secs. II A-II C, we recall the definition of the contour-ordered propagator in equilibrium and explain how to\nevaluate it non-perturbatively within the 2PI approximation scheme. This requires non-perturbative renormalisation\nas we discuss in Sec. II D.\nA.\n\nContour-ordered propagator\n\nConsider a complex time contour C, the properties of which we shall specify in what follows. The contour-ordered\npropagator is defined as\nG(x, y) \u2261 \u0398C (x0 , y0 ) G> (x, y) + \u0398C (y0 , x0 ) G> (y, x) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u0398C (x0 , y0 ) denotes the step function along the contour, equal to one if y0 precedes x0 and zero in the opposite\ncase. The Wightman function[70] G> (x, y) appearing in Eq. (1) is defined as\nG> (x, y) \u2261 h\u03c6(x)\u03c6(y)i\u03b2 \u2261\n\nTr e\u2212\u03b2H \u03c6(x)\u03c6(y)\n.\nTr e\u2212\u03b2H\n\n(2)\n\nIn equilibrium G> (x, y) depends on the difference of its arguments only and we shall use this simplification\nwhen necessary. Using Lehmann's representation one shows that G> (x \u2212 y) is analytic in the complex domain\n\n\f3\n\u2212\u03b2 < Im (x0 \u2212 y0 ) < 0. From the equal-time commutation relations, we have\n\u0002 >\n\u0003\nG (x, y) \u2212 G> (y, x) x0 =y0 = 0 ,\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2202x0 G> (x, y) \u2212 G> (y, x) x0 =y0 = \u2212i\u03b4 (3) (~x \u2212 ~y ) .\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nFinally, one can easily show the KMS (Kubo-Martin-Schwinger) relation\n\nG> (x0 \u2212 i\u03b2, y0 ; ~x, ~y ) = G> (y0 , x0 ; ~y, ~x) ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhich holds for 0 < Im (x0 \u2212 y0 ) < \u03b2. In Fourier space,[71] it reads\nG> (\u2212p0 , \u2212~\np) = e\u2212\u03b2p0 G> (p0 , p~) .\n\n(6)\n\nFrom the analyticity property of G> (x, y) it follows that the contour-ordered propagator G(x, y) is properly defined\nonly for contours with a decreasing imaginary part. Moreover, when one tries to practically compute G(x, y), a second\nimportant constraint appears on the contour, namely that it should stretch from some \u2013 arbitrary \u2013 initial time tI to\na final time tI \u2212 i\u03b2. This condition, which appears both in the canonical and path integral approaches, is dictated by\nthe presence of the operator e\u2212\u03b2H in the thermal average of Eq. (2). The same condition has been recently found for\nthe convergence of real-time lattice simulations [66]. One can construct numerous contours with decreasing imaginary\npart and stretching from time tI to tI \u2212 i\u03b2. We shall refer to them as admissible contours. If one is interested in\nreal-time aspects, the first branch of the contour should be contained in the real time axis. A particular example of\nsuch a contour is the close-time path, represented in Fig. 1.\nt\n\n\u2212i \u03b2\nFIG. 1: Close-time path. We here chose tI = 0.\n\nB.\n\nPropagator from the 2PI approximation scheme\n\nAny propagator ordered along an admissible contour admits the path integral representation\nR\n\b R\nD\u03c6 \u03c6(x)\u03c6(y) exp i C L(x)\nR\n\b\nR\n,\nG(x, y) =\nD\u03c6 exp i C L(x)\n\n(7)\n\nwhere L(x) is the Lagrangian density\n\nL(x) =\n\n1\n\u03bb\n1\n(\u2202\u03c6(x))2 \u2212 m2 (\u03c6(x))2 \u2212 (\u03c6(x))4\n2\n2\n4!\n\n(8)\n\nand the path integral is taken over fields satisfying the boundary condition \u03c6(tI ; ~x) = \u03c6(tI \u2212 i\u03b2; ~x). This path integral\nrepresentation can be used to obtain a perturbative expansion of the contour-ordered propagator. It can also be used\nto define systematic non-perturbative approximations of the latter, as we now explain.\nThe contour-ordered propagator (7) can in fact be obtained from the generating functional\nZ\nR\nR\nR R\ni\nW [J, K] \u2261 \u2212i ln D\u03c6 ei C L(x)+i C J(x)\u03c6(x)+ 2 C C \u03c6(x)K(x,y)\u03c6(y) ,\n(9)\neither from a second derivative with respect to the source J(x) or a single derivative with respect to the source K(x, y),\nevaluated for vanishing sources. If we now introduce, the conjugate variables \u03c6(x) and G(x, y) defined by\n\u03b4W [J, K]\n\u2261 \u03c6(x)\n\u03b4J(x)\n\nand\n\ni\n\u03b4W [J, K]\n1h\n\u2261 G(x, y) + \u03c6(x)\u03c6(y) ,\n\u03b4K(x, y)\n2\n\n(10)\n\n\f4\nwe can construct the double Legendre transform of W [J, K]:\nZ\nZ Z\nh\ni\n1\n\u0393[\u03c6, G] \u2261 W [J, K] \u2212 J(x)\u03c6(x) \u2212\nK(x, y) G(x, y) + \u03c6(x)\u03c6(y) ,\n2 C C\nC\nfrom which one can easily recover the initial sources J(x) and K(x, y) as\nZ\n\u03b4\u0393[\u03c6, G]\n1\n\u03b4\u0393[\u03c6, G]\n= \u2212J(x)\u2212 K(x, y)\u03c6(y) and\n= \u2212 K(x, y) .\n\u03b4\u03c6(x)\n\u03b4G(x,\ny)\n2\nC\n\n(11)\n\n(12)\n\nThe benefit of this last equation is that, for a given source K(x, y), it defines the two-point[72] function G(x, y) as\nthe solution to an implicit variational equation, which in turn is a powerful means for resumming Feynman diagrams\nand defining the contour-ordered propagator non-perturbatively.\nIt is particularly convenient to introduce the decomposition\ni\ni\n\u0393[\u03c6, G] \u2261 S0 [\u03c6] + TrC ln G\u22121 + TrC G0\u22121 G + \u0393int [\u03c6, G]\n2\n2\n\n(13)\n\n2\n2\nwhere S0 [\u03c6] denotes the free classical action along the contour C and G\u22121\n0 (x, y) \u2261 i(\u2202x + m )\u03b4C (x, y) is the corresponding free inverse propagator. This decomposition allows one to rewrite Eq. (12) as\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\nd4 z G\u22121\n(14)\n\u03b4C (x, y) =\n0 (x, z) \u2212 \u03a3(x, z) \u2212 iK(x, z) G(z, y) ,\nC\n\nwhere the self-energy \u03a3(x, y) is obtained from\n\n\u03a3(x, y) = 2i\n\n\u03b4\u0393int [\u03c6, G]\n.\n\u03b4G(y, x)\n\n(15)\n\nSince i\u0393int [\u03c6, G] has a simple diagrammatic interpretation [35] as the sum of all vac-to-vac two-particle-irreducible\n(2PI) diagrams of the shifted interaction part of the theory Sint [\u03c6 + \u03c6], it is very easy to define systematic nonperturbative approximations of the contour-ordered propagator using Eqs. (14) and (15). One has simply to select a\ncertain number of 2PI diagrams in \u0393int [\u03c6, G], plug them in the right-hand-side of Eq. (15) and solve the latter together\nwith Eq. (14). In this work we concentrate on the three-loop approximation to \u0393int [\u03c6, G] in the absence of a field\nexpectation value for which Eq. (15) becomes\n\u03a3(x, y) \u2261 \u2212i\u03a30 (x)\u03b4C (x, y) + \u0398C (x0 , y0 )\u03a3> (x, y) + \u0398C (y0 , x0 )\u03a3> (y, x)\n\n(16)\n\nwith\n\u03a30 (x) =\n\n\u03bb\nG(x, x)\n2\nC.\n\nand \u03a3> (x, y) = \u2212\n\n\u03bb2 >\nG (x, y)3 .\n6\n\n(17)\n\nEquivalence of contours\n\nBecause we are discussing equilibrium, we set the source K(x, y) to zero for the moment. We shall later consider,\nin Sec. III, a non-vanishing source has a means to bring the system out-of-equilibrium.\nInverting equation Eq. (14) to obtain the propagator G(x, y) in terms of the self-energy \u03a3(x, y) is usually rendered\ncumbersome due to the non-real parts of the contour. As an important simplification, in App. A we prove that, in\nequilibrium, any propagator ordered along an admissible contour can be reconstructed from the so-called real-time\npropagator, obtained from solving Eqs. (14) and (16) on the real-time path (depicted in Fig. 2), with the KMS and\nequal-time commutation relations as boundary conditions. The KMS condition is necessary because, in going from\nt\n\nFIG. 2: Real-time path.\n\nthe close-time path to the real-time path, one looses any reference to the temperature and one needs a sensible way\nto reintroduce it.\n\n\f5\nIn what follows, we restrict our analysis to the real-time path. In this case, Eq. (14) can be put in a more tractable\nform by introducing the functions\ni\nh\ni\n1h\nF (x, y) \u2261 G> (x, y) + G> (y, x) , \u03c1(x, y) \u2261 i G> (x, y) \u2212 G> (y, x)\n(18)\n2\nas well as\n\n\u03a3F (x, y) \u2261\n\ni\nh\ni\n1h >\n\u03a3 (x, y) + \u03a3> (y, x) , \u03a3\u03c1 (x, y) \u2261 i \u03a3> (x, y) \u2212 \u03a3> (y, x) .\n2\n\n(19)\n\nUsing the equal-time commutation relations, one can then recast Eq. (14) into a pair of partial differential equations\n\u2202x2\n\n2\n\n+ m + \u03a30\n\n\u0001\n\nZ0\nZx0\n4\nF (x) = dz \u03a3F (x \u2212 z)\u03c1(z) \u2212 dz 4 \u03a3\u03c1 (x \u2212 z)F (z) ,\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(20)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nZx0\n\u0001\n2\n2\n\u2202x + m + \u03a30 \u03c1(x) = \u2212 dz 4 \u03a3\u03c1 (x \u2212 z)\u03c1(z) ,\n\n(21)\n\n0\n\nwhere \u03a30 , \u03a3F (x) and \u03a3\u03c1 (x) can also be expressed in terms of F (x, y) and \u03c1(x, y). In writing these equations, we have\nused the fact that, in the absence of sources the functions F (x, y), \u03c1(x, y), \u03a3F (x, y) and \u03a3\u03c1 (x, y) only depend on the\ndifference of their arguments.\nIn order to yield a particular solution, the previous two equations need to be supplemented by some boundary\nconditions. Those for the spectral density \u03c1(x) are fixed by the equal time commutation relations: \u03c1(x)|x0 =0 = 0 and\n\u2202x0 \u03c1(x)|x0 =0 = 1. As for F (x), the boundary condition is nothing but the KMS condition we alluded to before. In\nterms of F/\u03c1 components, it takes the form\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n+ f (p0 ) \u03c1(p0 , ~p) ,\n(22)\nF (p0 , p\n~) = \u2212i\n2\nwhere f (p0 ) = 1/(e\u03b2p0 \u2212 1) denotes the Bose-Einstein factor. In fact once the KMS condition is assumed, the system\nof equations (20)-(21) becomes redundant. To see this in our particular example, notice that\nZ 4 Z 4\nd k\n\u03bb2\nd l\n\u03a3> (p) = \u2212\nG> (k) G> (l) G> (p \u2212 k \u2212 l) ,\n(23)\n4\n6\n(2\u03c0)\n(2\u03c0)4\nfrom which one can check that \u03a3> (p), and in turn \u03a3F (p) and \u03a3\u03c1 (p), obey KMS conditions similar to Eqs. (6) and\n(22) respectively. Then writing Eqs. (20) and (21) in Fourier space (we set \u03c9p~2 \u2261 p~2 + m2 + \u03a30 ):\n\u0014\n\u0015\nd\u03c9 \u03a3F (p) \u03c1(\u03c9; p~)\n\u03a3\u03c1 (\u03c9; p~) F (p)\n,\n+\n2\u03c0 i(p0 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2212 i\u01eb) i(p0 \u2212 \u03c9 + i\u01eb)\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n\u03a3\u03c1 (\u03c9; p~) \u03c1(p)\nd\u03c9 \u03a3\u03c1 (p) \u03c1(\u03c9; p~)\n,\n+\n(\u2212p20 + \u03c9p~2 ) \u03c1(p) =\n2\u03c0 i(p0 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2212 i\u01eb) i(p0 \u2212 \u03c9 + i\u01eb)\n\n(\u2212p20 + \u03c9p~2 ) F (p) =\n\nZ\n\n(24)\n(25)\n\nit is straightforward to check that Eq. (24) implies Eq. (25) and vice versa. We conclude that in equilibrium, one only\nneeds to solve Eq. (21) for \u03c1(x) and determine F (x) from the KMS condition. Equation (21) needs to be renormalised,\nas we now explain.\nD.\n\nRenormalisation\n\nEquation (21) for the spectral density is usually plagued by ultraviolet divergences which one needs to renormalise\nin order to define a continuum limit. It has to be noted that, due to the presence of a Landau pole, this limit does\nnot exist in the strict sense. It is true, however, that there is a wide range of couplings where the Landau pole is\nfar in the UV and renormalisation can ensure the insensitivity to the cut-off, if it is significantly higher than other\nphysical scales, but does not exceed the Landau pole, at which the computed bare coupling diverges. We use the term\n\"continuum limit\" in this restricted sense. Pattern of the divergence of bare parameters in the vicinity of the Landau\npole has been discussed in [67] in the 2PI three-loop approximation, that we also use here.\n\n\f6\nRenormalisation on the real-time path has been considered in [50]. In this work we shall rather consider renormalisation in the so-called imaginary-time path [58] and infer renormalisation on the real-time path. Indeed, according\nto App. A, the solution to Eqs. (14) and (16) on the real-time path supplemented by the KMS and equal-time commutation relations can be used to construct propagators ordered along any admissible contour, at the same level of\napproximation. In particular, if one chooses the imaginary-time path depicted in Fig. 3, one obtains the so-called\nimaginary-time or Euclidean propagator (\u2212\u03b2 < \u03c4 < \u03b2)\nGE (\u03c4 ; ~x) \u2261 \u0398(\u03c4 )G> (\u2212i\u03c4 ; ~x) + \u0398(\u2212\u03c4 )G> (i\u03c4 ; \u2212~x) ,\n\n(26)\n\nwhere G> (\u2212i\u03c4 ; ~x) is the analytic continuation of the real-time Wightman function to the imaginary-time path, as\ndefined in Eq. (A3) of App. A. The KMS condition implies that GE (\u03c4 ; ~x) is \u03b2-periodic in \u03c4 from which one concludes\nt\n\n\u2212i \u03b2\n\nFIG. 3: Imaginary time path.\n\nthat GE (\u03c4 ; ~x) can equally be represented by its Fourier modes GE (p) with p \u2261 (i\u03c9n ; p~) and \u03c9n = (2\u03c0/\u03b2)n a discrete\nMatsubara frequency:\nZ \u03b2 Z\nGE (i\u03c9n ; p~) \u2261\nd\u03c4 d3 x ei\u03c9n \u03c4 e\u2212i~p*~x G> (\u2212i\u03c4 ; ~x) .\n(27)\n0\n\nUsing Eq. (A3) and the KMS condition, one then shows that\nZ\nd4 p i\u03c1(p0 ; ~p)\nGE (i\u03c9n ; ~p) =\n(2\u03c0)4 i\u03c9n \u2212 p0\n\n(28)\n\nfrom which it follows that\n\u03c1(p0 ; p~) = 2i Im GE (p0 + i\u03b5; ~p) .\n\n(29)\n\nWe conclude from this, that in order to renormalise \u03c1(p0 ; ~p), it is enough to renormalise GE (i\u03c9n ; p~). This assumes\nthat the analytic continuation involved in Eq. (29) does not bring in new divergences. This assumption is plausible\nsince, in what follows, we restrict to a spatial cut-off and leave the time direction in the continuum, see below.\n1.\n\nImaginary time counterterms\n\n\u22121\nIn Fourier space, the Euclidean propagator in the approximation at hand is such that G\u22121\nE (p) \u2261 GE,0 (p) + \u03a3E (p)\n2\nwith G\u22121\np2 + m2 and\nE,0 (p) \u2261 \u03c9n + ~\n\n\u03a3E (p) = \u03b4\u03a3ct\nE (p) +\n\nZ\nZ Z\n\u03bb\n\u03bb2\n\u03a3 GE (k) \u2212\n\u03a3 \u03a3 GE (k)GE (l)GE (p \u2212 k \u2212 l) ,\n2 k\n6 k l\n\n(30)\n\nThe piece \u03b4\u03a3ct\nE (p) contains counterterms which should be adjusted in such a way that UV divergences are absorbed.\nDue to Eq. (28), the counterterms in imaginary-time are exactly those needed to renormalise the equations in realtime. Strictly speaking this is true if the time integral is not discretized. For this reason we introduce a spatial cut-off\nonly. For such an anisotropic regularisation and at three-loop order in the 2PI-loop expansion the counterterm piece\nreads\n2\n\u03b4\u03a3ct\n~2 + \u03b4M 2\nE (p) = \u03b4Zt \u03c9n + \u03b4Zs p\n\n(31)\n\nwith\n2\n\n\u03b4M \u2261\n\n\u03b4m2E\n\nZ\n\u03b4\u03bbE\n+\n\u03a3 GE (k) .\n2\nk\n\n(32)\n\n\f7\nThe three counterterms in Eq. (31) can be fixed using renormalisation conditions at a reference temperature T \u22c6 and\na reference momentum p\u22c6\n\u03a3\u22c6E (p\u22c6 ) = 0 ,\n\nd\u03a3\u22c6E (p)\nd\u03c9n2\n\n= 0,\np=p\u22c6\n\nd\u03a3\u22c6E (p)\ndp23\n\n= 0,\n\n(33)\n\np=p\u22c6\n\nsee App. C for Algorithm (1) which finds these counterterms. These three renormalisation conditions are, however,\nnot sufficient to ensure insensitivity to the UV cut-off at a temperature T away from the renormalisation temperature\nT \u22c6 . For this to be achieved one needs to adjust the coupling counterterm \u03b4\u03bbE in such a way that coupling UV\nsubdivergences which appear in \u03a3E (p) are properly absorbed. These subdivergences can easily be accounted for by\nremarking that they are obtained after opening a perturbative line (corresponding to a free propagator GE,0 ) in any\nof the diagrams contributing to \u03a3E (p). Algebraically, this corresponds to considering the function \u03b4\u03a3E (p)/\u03b4GE,0 (q)\nwhich is shown to be given by:\nVE (p, q)/2\n\u03b4\u03a3E (p)\n=\n\u03b4GE,0 (q)\n(1 + GE,0 (q)\u03a3E (q))2\n\n(34)\n\nZ\n1\nVE (p, q) = \u039bE (p, q) \u2212 \u03a3 VE (p, r)[GE (r)]2 \u039bE (r, q)\n2 r\n\n(35)\n\nZ\n\u039bE (p, q) \u2261 \u03bb + \u03b4\u03bbE \u2212 \u03bb2 \u03a3 GE (k)GE (p \u2212 q \u2212 k) .\n\n(36)\n\nwith\n\nand\nk\n\nEquation (34) tells that if one wants to properly absorb coupling subdivergences appearing in \u03a3E (p), one needs to\nrenormalise the function VE (p, q) as well. This is actually done by means of the following renormalisation condition\nat the reference temperature T \u22c6 :\nVE\u22c6 (p\u22c6 , p\u22c6 ) = \u03bb .\n\n(37)\n\nThis fixes the value of the coupling counterterm \u03b4\u03bbE and ensures that VE (p, q) as well as \u03a3E (p) are not sensitive to\nthe UV cut-off at any temperature T .\nAlthough it is possible to solve Eq. (35) exactly as a linear algebra problem, we recommend the strategy detailed\nin Algorithm (2), see App. C. In Ref. [67] we have solved this equation numerically in imaginary time and calculated\nthe renormalised 2PI pressure of a scalar \u03c64 theory to three-loop order in the 2PI-loop expansion.\n2.\n\nReal-time counterterms\n\nIn principle the counterterms in real time should be equal to those in imaginary time, as long as time is not\ndiscretised. We have checked this numerically for \u03c64 theory, but the agreement was not accurate, unless we used\nextremely anisotropic regulators (at /a . 0.05), which is a highly inconvenient choice for the subsequent nonequilibrium\napplication due to the expense of the required storage and computation. If instead, we want to use a conveniently\ncoarse discretisation, we should not rely on the counterterm values obtained in imaginary time but rather compute\nthem in real time, directly. Still, calculations in imaginary time are not totally useless here since they allow for a\ncheap determination of real time counterterms (without actually solving a real time version of Eq. (35)), as we now\nexplain.\nFirst of all, we notice that in imaginary time the field strength counter-terms \u03b4Zt and \u03b4Zs grow logarithmically\nwith the cutoff with a prefactor of the order of 10\u22125 . This means that the finite part of the self-energy reaches a\ncut-off insensitive value before field strength divergences can even show up. In other words, for the cut-off values we\nuse, we can equally drop \u03b4Zs and \u03b4Zt and still obtain cut-off insensitive results.[73] We assume that this is also true\nin real time and check this a posteriori.\nWe still need to fix the mass and coupling counterterms in real time. The trick we use here to avoid solving the\nreal-time version of Eq. (35) is that the coupling can equally be fixed by considering any other coupling dependent\nobservable, such as the thermal mass or the renormalisation scale dependence [61]. Suppose then that we know\nthe thermal mass m2th (T ) from a calculation in imaginary time (we may use here a convenient close-to-continuum\nregulator, e.g. at \u226a a, aT \u226a 1, am \u226a 1), defined as\nm2th (T ) \u2261 \u03a3E (p = 0) ,\n\n(38)\n\n\f8\nwhere \u03a3E (p = 0) contains the imaginary time counterterms \u03b4m2E and \u03b4\u03bbE , and renormalisation is implemented according to Eqs. (33) and (37), see Algorithms (1) and (2). We can evaluate this thermal mass at different temperatures.\nIn particular if we evaluate it for two different temperatures we have in principle enough information to recover the\nvalues of the counterterms \u03b4m2E and \u03b4\u03bbE . Now, the thermal mass has also an expression in real-time which involves\nthe real-time counterterms\nZ \u221e\nZ\nd4 k\n\u03bb + \u03b4\u03bb\nF\n(k)\n+\ndt \u03a3\u03c1 (t; ~p = ~0) .\n(39)\nm2th (T ) = \u03b4m2 +\n2\n(2\u03c0)4\n0\nUsing the two values for the thermal mass obtained in imaginary-time we can obtain the values for the real-time\ncounterterms. This is used in Algorithm (3), see App. C.\nIII.\n\nDEPARTING FROM EQUILIBRIUM\n\nLet us now consider a nonequilibrium situation. If we aim at studying late-time dynamics and thermalisation, the\nevolution should include the counterterms obtained in the previous section in order to describe the final equilibrated\nstate properly. Because these counterterms do not depend on time, they will be present at any time of the evolution.\nThen, depending on how one sets up the evolution equations, this might lead to problems such as a UV divergent time\nevolution. In Sec. 3.1, we first quickly revisit the evolution equations with a Gaussian initial condition and discuss\nwhy one fails in obtaining a continuum limit for this type of evolution. In Sec. 3.2, we start the evolution from a\nself-consistently dressed initial quantum state. We give arguments for the existence of a continuum limit in this case\nand support them with numerical evidence.\nA.\n\nGaussian initial condition\n\nA popular initialisation of the propagator is a Gaussian quantum state [39]. A remarkable feature of this special\nchoice is that the memory integrals start at initial time, and the only input parameter to be fixed is the initial\npropagator and its first derivatives at equal time. The equations of motion in the F /\u03c1 formalism read [39]:\n\u2202x2 +m2+\u03a30 (x)\n\n\u0001\n\n\u2202x2 +m2+\u03a30 (x)\n\nZx0\nZy0\n4\nF\nF (x, y) = d z\u03a3 (x, z)\u03c1(z, y)\u2212 d4 z\u03a3\u03c1 (x, z)F (z, y),\n\n\u0001\n\n(40)\n\n0\n\n0\n\nZx0\n\u03c1(x, y)= \u2212 d4 z\u03a3\u03c1 (x, z)\u03c1(z, y) .\n\n(41)\n\ny0\n\nThis initial prescription has been frequently used to successfully describe systems with a fixed cut-off. In low\ndimensional systems renormalisation is less problematic [68]. In a 3+1 dimensional continuum quantum field theory,\nhowever, this class of initial conditions is not useful for the continuum limit of the time evolution is not accessible.\nOne simple way to view this is to consider the equation for F (x, y) at initial time x0 = y0 = 0. The contribution \u03a30 (x)\nin the left-hand-side of this equation contains the counterterms which are supposed to renormalise the equilibrium\nstate obtained from the time evolution. In contrast, the right-hand-side of the equation is equal to zero and thus,\npart of the diagrams which should be absorbed by the counterterms are absent: One has an unbalanced divergence.\nIn Fig. 4 we present numerical results for the time evolution obtained from this kind of initial condition. We\nparametrise the initial equal-time statistical correlator F (t, t; p~) using the particle number\nn(~\np) = N exp(\u2212(|~\np| \u2212 pc )2 /2\u03c3 2 )\n\n(42)\n\nwith N = 5, \u03c3 = 0.6m, pc = m. We use the counterterms determined at T \u22c6 = m and plot the evolution of three\ndifferent modes |~\np| = 0.4, 0.8, 1.6 for three different values of lattice spacing am = 1/4, 1/6, 1/8. On such fine lattices\none expects at least an approximate convergence as am \u2192 0, as it will indeed happen in the next subsection. These\ncurves, however, show no sign of a continuum limit. In what follows, we propose a possible way to cure this.\nB.\n\nSelf-consistent initial conditions\n\nThe general framework of Sec. II suggests an alternative way to bring the system out of thermal equilibrium. One\nsimply has to calculate the 2PI propagator in presence of a non-vanishing external source K(x, y) living on the real-\n\n\f9\n\n1000\n\nam=1/4\nam=1/6\nam=1/8\n\nF(t,t;p)\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n\np=0.8 m\np=0.4 m\np=1.6 m\n\n0.1\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n-1\n\ntime [m ]\nFIG. 4: Time evolution of the equal-time statistical correlator F (t, t; ~\np) with fixed Gaussian initial propagator (\u03bb = 24,\nbox size : L = 32) for three different modes |~\np| = 0.4, 0.8, 1.6 and three different values of lattice spacing am = 1/4, 1/6, 1/8.\nThe counterterms we determine at temperature T \u22c6 = m are not enough to ensure a continuum limit of the time evolution.\n\ntime path. In this paper we assume the components K0 (x) and K\u03c1 (x, y) to vanish, in such a way that the equations\nfor the 2PI propagator read\n\u2202x2 +m2 +\u03a30 (x)\n\n\u0001\n\nZy0\nZx0\n4 K\nF (x, y)= dz \u03a3F (x, z)\u03c1(z, y)\u2212 dz 4 \u03a3\u03c1 (x, z)F (z, y),\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(43)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nZx0\n\u0001\n2\n2\n\u2202x +m +\u03a30 (x) \u03c1(x, y)=\u2212 dz 4 \u03a3\u03c1 (x, z)\u03c1(z, y) ,\n\n(44)\n\ny0\n\nwhere \u03a3K\nF \u2261 \u03a3F + iKF . The benefit of this approach is that the renormalisability of the evolution equations only\ndepends on the properties of the source K(x, y). As we motivate in App. B, once the problem has been properly\nrenormalised in the absence of source, see Sec. II D, introducing a source does not bring new divergences provided\nthe UV behavior of the source is well under control. More precisely we show that, on the imaginary-time path, a\nsource K with proper asymptotics does not alter the UV structure of the Euclidean theory. To do so we expand the\nself-energy \u03a3E in powers of K around the equilibrium solution \u03a3K=0\nwhich we know how to renormalise:[74]\nE\n\u2206\u03a3E \u2261 \u03a3E \u2212 \u03a3K=0\n=\nE\n\nX 1 \u03b4 n \u03a3E\nn! \u03b4K n\n\nn\u22651\n\nKn\n\n(45)\n\nK=0\n\nand show that each term of this expansion is finite provided K has the correct UV asymptotics. Of course, strictly\nspeaking, it is not completely obvious that the result of App. B obtained on the imaginary-time path can be applied\nto the real-time path. We shall however provide numerical evidence for a continuum limit on the real-time path which\nis an indication that our argument does not really depend on the contour we consider.\nSuppose we use a source given by\n\u001a\nKF (x \u2212 y) if x0 < 0 and y0 < 0 ;\n(46)\nKF (x, y) \u2261\n0\nif x0 > 0 or y0 > 0 .\nFor times smaller than zero, the system is in a steady state sustained by the translationally invariant source KF (x\u2212y).\nSuch states exist for all times and can be obtained by solving the simplified, translationally invariant equations\n\u2202x2\n\n2\n\n+ m + \u03a30\n\n\u0001\n\nZ0\nZx0\n4 K\nF (x) = dz \u03a3F (x \u2212 z)\u03c1(z) \u2212 dz 4 \u03a3\u03c1 (x \u2212 z)F (z) ,\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(47)\n\n\f10\n\u0001\n\u2202x2 + m2 + \u03a30 \u03c1(x) = \u2212\n\nZx0\ndz 4 \u03a3\u03c1 (x \u2212 z)\u03c1(z) .\n\n(48)\n\n0\n\nThe source KF (x \u2212 y) alone does not completely fix the solution of these equations, as it was also the case in\nequilibrium (no source). To define a particular solution we introduce a non-thermal boundary condition in the form\nof a generalised KMS condition\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n+ f (p0 ; p~) \u03c1(p0 ; p~) ,\n(49)\nF (p0 ; p~) = \u2212i\n2\nwhere f (p0 ; ~p) is an arbitrary function. The ad-hoc use of Eq. (49) has already been suggested in Ref. [40] as a recipe\nto prepare a dressed initial state. We shall restrict to this type of boundary conditions in what follows. Notice that\nthis generalised KMS condition actually fixes the source to\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nKF (p) \u2261 \u2212\n+ f (p0 ; ~p) \u03a3\u03c1 (p) + i \u03a3F (p) ,\n(50)\n2\nas it can be shown by writing Eqs. (47)-(48) in Fourier space. We need to require that f (p0 ; p~) approaches a thermal\nBose-Einstein factor with some temperature sufficiently fast in the UV. This restriction makes sure that the expansion\nin K used in the above argument is defined around equilibrium and that the asymptotics of K is appropriate to ensure\nthat the steady solution admits a continuum limit. The details on how to obtain the steady propagator are given in\nAlgorithm (4), see App. C.\nNow let us turn to the nonequilibrium dynamics. For times greater than zero, one has to solve\nZy0\nZx0\n\u0001\n2\n2\n\u2202x + m + \u03a30 F (x, y) = dz 4 \u03a3F (x, z)\u03c1(z, y) \u2212 dz 4 \u03a3\u03c1 (x, z)F (z, y)\n(51)\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nZx0\n\u0001\n2\n2\n\u2202x + m + \u03a30 \u03c1(x, y) = \u2212 dz 4 \u03a3\u03c1 (x, z)\u03c1(z, y) ,\n\n(52)\n\ny0\n\nwhere in the integrals, the parts involving times smaller than zero involve the pre-calculated steady solution we just\ndiscussed. In the course of time evolution x0 is always considered as the most recent time. Notice, that for practical\npurposes, we only keep the latest part of the memory integrals with |x0 \u2212 z0 | < tmem . Equations (51)-(52) look similar\nto (40) and (41) but there is in fact a big difference: The memory integrals are present at time x0 = y0 = 0 already\nand can therefore prevent an unbalanced divergence, unlike what happened in the case of a Gaussian initial condition.\nStill for the divergences to be completely cancelled by the counterterms, the inhomogeneous source K, see Eq. (46),\nshould again have the required asymptotics. This in turn depends on how one chooses f (p0 ; p~) in the generalized\nKMS condition. In this paper we shall not prove analytically that this source has the correct asymptotic behavior.\nRather we shall provide numerical evidence for this, by generating a cut-off insensitive time evolution.\nIn Fig. 5 we present the time evolution of the equal-time statistical propagator F (t, t; p~) for three different modes\n|~\np| = 0.4, 0.8, 1.6 and three different values of lattice spacing am = 1/4, 1/6, 1/8. We prepare the initial correlated\nstate with\n1\nf (p0 ; p~) = p /T (~p)\n(53)\ne 0\n\u22121\nwhere T (~\np) = T \u22c6 + \u03c9p~ / log(1 + 1/n(~\np)), \u03c9p~2 \u2261 p~2 + m2th (T \u22c6 ) and n(~\np) is the initial particle distribution (42) that we\nused in the case of the Gaussian initial condition. The counterterms are again determined in equilibrium at temperature T \u22c6 = m. For a given mode, the curves representing runs for different values of the spatial cut-off lie almost\nexactly on top of each other, showing that the continuum limit has been reached. This plot strongly suggests that\nour approach to out-of-equilibrium renormalisation correctly removes all UV divergences and thus allows to define a\ncontinuumlimit.\nThe final relaxation to equilibrium is particularly sensitive to the truncation of the memory integral. For the plot\nwe used tmem = 12m\u22121 . Keeping longer memory we could avoid the small deviation of the curves at \u223c 1000m\u22121.\nLong memory integrals, however, are vulnerable to \"instabilities\" on the course of the time evolution. Traces of such\n\"instabilities\" can already be seen in Fig. 5 on the uppermost curves at \u223c 100m\u22121. This phenomenon manifests\nin a high-frequency oscillation on the low-momentum F (t, t; p~) curves, and eventually relaxes. Also, after this highfrequency oscillations have died out, the F (t, t; ~p) function continues normally and maintains the approximate amindependence. This phenomenon persisted in an increased volume. Nevertheless, from our test run with L = 48 we\ncan conclude that the curves in Fig. 5 are very close to the infinite volume limit up to about \u223c 1000m\u22121 where finite\nvolume effects start to matter.\n\n\f11\n16\n\nam=1/4\nam=1/6\nam=1/8\n\n14\n12\n\np=0.4 m\n\nF(t,t;p)\n\n10\n8\n6\n\np=0.8 m\n\n4\n2\n0\n\np=1.6 m\n\n-2\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\ntime [m-1]\nFIG. 5: Time evolution of F (t, t; p\n~) (\u03bb = 24, box size : L = 32) for three different modes |~\np| = 0.4, 0.8, 1.6 and three different\nvalues of lattice spacing am = 1/4, 1/6, 1/8. The counterterms are determined at temperature T \u22c6 = m. For a given mode,\nthe curves corresponding to runs with a different lattice spacing almost exactly match each other, which indicates that the\ncontinuum limit has been reached. We have checked that the curve for am = 1/2 still shows sizeable deviations.\n\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe have discussed the renormalisation of the initial value problem in a scalar quantum field theory. We have\nintroduced a self-consistent initialisation of the 2PI equations of motion that defines a cut-off independent initial\nquantum state. We have also argued for the absence of new divergences in this setting and performed a numerical\nanalysis to show the continuum limit evolution of a nonequilibrium quantum field theory.\nIn this paper we considered the excitation of an originally equilibrium system using a two-point source. Although\nwe have not discussed it in this paper, one could give similar arguments for the finiteness of the solution in presence\nof a one-point source J(x) with proper asymptotics. For a spatially homogeneous initial condition, J(x) may only\ndepend on time. This kind of initialisation is for example suited to describe the parametric resonance scenario.\nThe primary goal of this paper is to provide recipes. Although scalar fields have already been extensively discussed\nout-of-equilibrium in the 2PI approach, most algorithms and technical details have not been well documented yet. To\nencourage research groups to start working in this field we provide the detailed algorithms used in this work.\nAlthough scalar theories are interesting on their own (e.g. in cosmological scenarios), they are often considered\nas a warm up exercise for the more complicated gauge theories. The renormalisation of the 2PI effective action for\nquantum electrodynamics has been understood by now in equilibrium [65], and a similar nonequilibrium discussion\nand numerical analysis is possible. One issue of interest which could be then studied is the gauge-fixing dependence\nof the time evolution.\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors would like to thank J\u00fcrgen Berges, Mathias Garny, Markus Michael M\u00fcller and Julien Serreau for\nfruitful discussions on related issues.

(14) and (16) on the real-time path, obeying the equal time commutation relations\nand the KMS condition. As we have seen in Sec. II C, these boundary conditions specify a unique solution. It will\n\n\f12\nbe convenient to consider the corresponding Wightman function G> (x, y), defined, for the moment, for real values of\nthe time arguments. Combining Eqs. (24) and (25), one obtains an equation for G> (x, y) in Fourier space:\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\nd\u03c9 \u03a3> (p) \u03c1(\u03c9; ~p)\n\u03a3\u03c1 (\u03c9; p~) G> (p)\n(\u2212p20 + \u03c9p~2 ) G> (p) =\n,\n(A1)\n+\n2\u03c0 i(p0 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2212 i\u01eb)\ni(p0 \u2212 \u03c9 + i\u01eb)\nwhere \u03c9p~2 \u2261 p~2 + m2 + \u03a30 and \u03a30 = (\u03bb/2)G(0) = (\u03bb/2)G> (0).\nUsing the KMS condition in the form\n>\n\u2212\u03b2\u03c9\n\u03c1(\u03c9; ~p) = ig(\u03c9)G (\u03c9; p~), where g(\u03c9) \u2261 1 \u2212 e\n, and the fact that a similar condition holds between the self-energies\n\u03a3\u03c1 (\u03c9; ~p) and \u03a3> (\u03c9; ~\np), see Sec. II C, we arrive at\n\u0015\n\u0014 >\nZ\n\u0001\nd\u03c9\n\u03a3 (p)G> (\u03c9; ~p) \u03a3> (\u03c9; p~)G> (p)\n.\n(A2)\ng(\u03c9)\n+\n\u2212p20 + \u03c9p~2 G> (p) =\n2\u03c0\np0 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2212 i\u03b5\np0 \u2212 \u03c9 + i\u03b5\nWe can now use G> (p) to define G> (x, y) for complex values of the time arguments:\nZ\nd4 p \u2212ip(x\u2212y) >\n>\ne\nG (p) .\nG (x, y) \u2261\n(2\u03c0)4\n\n(A3)\n\nIf we assume that G> (p) does not grow exponentially at large positive frequencies, this definition makes sense provided\nthat \u2212\u03b2 < Im (x0 \u2212 y0 ) < 0. Indeed, if Im (x0 \u2212 y0 ) < 0 the integral is well defined as p0 \u2192 +\u221e. Moreover, thanks\nto the KMS condition which relates the behavior at large positive and negative frequencies, it is easy to see that\nthe condition \u2212\u03b2 < Im (x0 \u2212 y0 ) guarantees that the integral is well defined as p0 \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Thanks to the analytic\ncontinuation (A3), we can now define, on any admissible contour C, the following function\nGC (x, y) = \u0398C (x0 , y0 )G> (x, y) + \u0398C (y0 , x0 )G> (y, x) .\n\n(A4)\n\nThe purpose of such a definition will become clear in a moment. Notice that, due to the equal-time commutation\nrelations, acting twice with \u2202x on GC (x, y) generates a delta function on the contour. Keeping this in mind, one\narrives at (we consider here the case Im x0 < Im y0 )\nZ\ndp0 \u2212ip0 (x0 \u2212y0 )\np) = \u03b4C (x0 , y0 ) +\ni(\u2202x20 + \u03c9p~2 ) GC (x0 , y0 ; ~\ne\ni(\u2212p20 + \u03c9p~2 )G> (p) .\n(A5)\n2\u03c0\nUsing Eq. (A2) and a simple change of variables, one finally obtains\n\u03b4C (x0 , y0 ) = i(\u2202x20 + \u03c9p~2 ) GC (x0 , y0 ; ~p)\nZ\nZ\nd\u03c91 d\u03c92 >\n\u03a3 (\u03c91 , p~)G> (\u03c92 , ~p)\n+\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\ne\u2212i\u03c91 (x0 \u2212y0 ) g(\u03c92 ) \u2212 e\u2212i\u03c92 (x0 \u2212y0 ) g(\u03c91 )\n\u00d7\n,\ni(\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92 )\n\n(A6)\n\nwhere we have dropped the \u01eb in the denominator since the integrand is well defined as \u03c91 and \u03c92 become equal.\nNow we would like to show that GC (x0 , y0 ; p~) is in fact the contour ordered propagator in the approximation at\nhand. In other words, we need to show that GC fulfills Eqs. (14) and (16) on the contour C. To this purpose let us\nevaluate the right-hand-side of Eq. (14). It can be written as\nZ y0\ndz0 \u03a3> (x0 , z0 ; p~)G> (y0 , z0 ; \u2212~\np)\nR \u2261 i(\u2202x20 + \u03c9p~2 )GC (x0 , y0 ; p~) +\ntI\nZ x0\ndz0 \u03a3> (x0 , z0 ; p~)G> (z0 , y0 ; p~)\n+\ny0\ntI \u2212i\u03b2\n\n+\n\nZ\n\ndz0 \u03a3> (z0 , x0 ; \u2212~\np)G> (z0 , y0 ; p~) ,\n\n(A7)\n\nx0\n\nwhere \u03c9p~2 = m2 + \u03a30 with \u03a30 = (\u03bb/2)GC (0) and \u03a3> (x, y) = \u2212(\u03bb2 /6)G> (x, y)3 . Notice that \u03a30 coincides with the one\nin Eq. (55) because GC (x, x) = G(x, x). Moreover, because \u03a3> (x, y) is simply the cube of G> (x, y), one can use the\nfact that, for any complex times x0 and y0 such that \u2212\u03b2 < Im (x0 \u2212 y0 ) < 0\nZ\nd4 p \u2212ip(x\u2212y) >\n>\ne\n\u03a3 (p) ,\n(A8)\n\u03a3 (x, y) \u2261\n(2\u03c0)4\n\n\f13\nto arrive at\nR \u2261 i(\u2202x20 + \u03c9p~2 )GC (x0 , y0 ; p~)\nZ\nei(\u03c91 \u2212\u03c92 )y0 \u2212 ei(\u03c91 \u2212\u03c92 )tI\n\u03a3> (\u03c91 ; ~\np) G> (\u2212\u03c92 ; \u2212~\np) e\u2212i\u03c91 x0 ei\u03c92 y0\n+\ni(\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92 )\n\u03c91 ,\u03c92\nZ\ni(\u03c91 \u2212\u03c92 )x0\ne\n\u2212 ei(\u03c91 \u2212\u03c92 )y0\n\u03a3> (\u03c91 ; ~\np) G> (\u03c92 ; p~) e\u2212i\u03c91 x0 ei\u03c92 y0\n+\ni(\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92 )\n\u03c91 ,\u03c92\nZ\ni(\u03c91 \u2212\u03c92 )(tI \u2212i\u03b2)\ne\n\u2212 ei(\u03c91 \u2212\u03c92 )x0\n.\n\u03a3> (\u2212\u03c91 ; \u2212~\np) G> (\u03c92 ; p~) e\u2212i\u03c91 x0 ei\u03c92 y0\n+\ni(\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92 )\n\u03c91 ,\u03c92\n\n(A9)\n\nUsing the KMS condition in the form G> (\u2212p0 ; \u2212~\np) = e\u2212\u03b2p0 G> (p0 ; ~p), it is possible to massage the following expression\nand obtain the right-hand-side of Eq. (A6). Thus R = \u03b4C (x0 , y0 ) which proves that GC is actually the propagator\nordered along the contour C, as announced.\nAPPENDIX B: RENORMALISATION WITH A SOURCE\n\nHere we would like to study the influence of a source K on the renormalisation of the 2PI self-consistent equations\nfor the propagator. To simplify the discussion we consider here the 2PI effective action on the imaginary-time path.\nIn presence of a source, the Euclidean propagator is given by (space variables implicit)\nZ \u03b2\nh\ni\n\u22121\nd\u03c4 \u2032 GE (\u03c4, \u03c4 \u2032 ) GE,0\n(\u03c4 \u2032 , \u03c4 \u2032\u2032 ) + \u03a3E (\u03c4 \u2032 , \u03c4 \u2032\u2032 ) + K(\u03c4 \u2032 , \u03c4 \u2032\u2032 ) = \u03b4(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 \u2032\u2032 )\n(B1)\n0\n\nwith\n\n\u03a3E (\u03c4, \u03c4 \u2032 ) =\n\n2 \u03b4\u0393E\nint\n\u03b4GE (\u03c4, \u03c4 \u2032 )\n\n(B2)\nGE\n\nwhere GE,0 is the free Euclidean propagator and \u0393E\nint \u2261 i\u0393int is the interaction part of the Euclidean 2PI effective\naction. We would like to determine under which conditions the counterterms obtained for K = 0 are enough to\nrenormalise \u03a3E in presence of the source K. In order to compare to the situation in the absence of source, we consider\n\u2206\u03a3E (\u03c4, \u03c4 \u2032 ) \u2261 \u03a3E (\u03c4, \u03c4 \u2032 ) \u2212 \u03a3K=0\n(\u03c4, \u03c4 \u2032 ) .\nE\n\n(B3)\n\nAssuming that the amplitude of K is small enough, it makes sense to expand \u2206\u03a3E as a functional Taylor expansion\nin powers of K. We then would like to find out under which conditions, the different terms of these expansion are\nvoid of UV divergences. Let us in particular consider the contribution linear in K.

It is then convenient to switch to Fourier space and define\nGK=0\n(p, p\u2032 ) \u2261 (2\u03c0)4 \u03b4 (4) (p + p\u2032 ) GE (p)\nE\n\n(B7)\n\n\f14\nand\n\u039bE (p, p\u2032 ; q, q \u2032 ) \u2261 (2\u03c0)4 \u03b4 (4) (p + p\u2032 + q + q \u2032 ) \u039bE (p, p\u2032 , q) ,\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n4 (4)\n\nVE (p, p ; q, q ) \u2261 (2\u03c0) \u03b4\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n(B8)\n\n\u2032\n\n(p + p + q + q ) VE (p, p , q) ,\n\n(B9)\n\nin terms of which, to linear order in K,\nZ\n1\n\u2206\u03a3E (p, p ) = \u2212 \u03a3 VE (p, p\u2032 , r)GE (\u2212r)GE (p + p\u2032 + r)K(\u2212r, p + p\u2032 + r)\n2 r\n\u2032\n\n(B10)\n\nwith\nVE (p, p\u2032 , q) = \u039bE (p, p\u2032 , q)\nZ\n1\n\u2212 \u03a3 VE (p, p\u2032 , r)GE (\u2212r)GE (p + p\u2032 + r)\u039bE (\u2212r, p + p\u2032 + r, q) .\n2 r\n\n(B11)\n\nThis last equation is more general than Eq. (35). One can, however, show that the counterterm \u03b4\u03bbE needed to\nrenormalise Eq. (35) is also the one needed to renormalise Eq. (B11).[75] So no new counterterms are needed here\nand VE (p, p\u2032 , q) is automatically UV convergent. Since VE (p, p\u2032 , q) grows at most logarithmically with increasing\nmomentum q (Weinberg's theorem) and since GE (q) decreases as 1/q 2 (up to logarithms), we conclude from Eq. (B10)\nthat, to linear order in K, \u2206\u03a3E is UV convergent provided that, for any value of the fixed momentum u, the source\nK decreases at least like[76]\nK(p, u \u2212 p) \u223c\n\n1\np\n\n(B12)\n\nas p goes to infinity (up to logarithms). A similar analysis shows that, with such a source, higher order contributions\nto \u2206\u03a3E (in powers of K) are also UV convergent. From this we conclude that provided that the source K follows \u2013\nat least \u2013 the asymptotic behavior (B12), renormalisation in the absence of K is enough to renormalise the system in\nthe presence of K.\nAPPENDIX C: ALGORITHMS\n\nThe recipes that we disclose here are improved versions of those we used in Ref.

The straightforward\nlattice discretisation of a homogeneous system will then lead to a propagator G(t1 , t2 , ~x) where ~x is a lattice 3-vector.\nThe isotropy in ~x reduces to a permutation symmetry between the components of ~x. Using also the reflection symmetry\none can conclude that if the action is defined on a lattice with an even linear size N , the total number of variables\nthat describes a propagator at a given pair of time coordinates is (N + 6)(N + 4)(N + 2)/48. This discretisation has\nbeen used by several groups, starting with Ref. [45], and also in Ref. [67].\nWe now introduce a different kind of discretisation, where the rotation symmetry of the propagator is exact, and\nthe number of independent variables in the propagator is N . This corresponds to a discretisation on the level of the\n2PI effective action, too.\nIn many cases we have to calculate a loop integral, which is the convolution of two symmetric functions\nZ p+k\nZ\nZ\n1 \u221e dk\nd3 k\ndq\n~\n~\nf (|k|)g(|~\np \u2212 k|) =\nkf (k)\nqg(q) .\n(D1)\n(f \u2217 g)(p) =\n3\n(2\u03c0)\np 0 2\u03c0\n|p\u2212k| 2\u03c0\n(Here and in the following we use plain letters for the modulus of a lattice 3-vector.) This convolution is not defined in\nthe strict sense without specifying a UV regulator. By fixing a momentum-space cut-off one also introduces Umklapp\nprocesses: if an outgoing momentum after a scattering process lies off the Brillouin zone, one maps this back to one\nof the modes inside. We motivate our cut-off prescription with numerical convenience. We would like to calculate the\nconvolution in Eq. (D1) as a product co-ordinate space:\n(f  \u0303\u2217 g)(x) = f \u0303(x)g\u0303(x) ,\nwhere the f \u0303(x) is the inverse Fourier transform of f (k) in terms of\nZ \u221e\ndk\n \u0303\nxf (x) =\nkf (k) sin kx .\n2\u03c0 2\n0\n\n(D2)\n\n(D3)\n\nWe will have to discretise this inverse sine transform in momentum and co-ordinate. To avoid problems with the\npotential singularities at x \u2192 0 and k \u2192 0 we choose a discretisation without these points. For the infrared behaviour\nwill assume that kf (k) \u2192 0 as k \u2192 0, which is certainly true in a massive theory. For algorithmic convenience we\nextend the momenum space functions beyond the cut-off \u039b by the equation kf (k) = (2\u039b \u2212 k)f (2\u039b \u2212 k), this implicitely\ndetermines the Umklapp behaviour.\nThe discretised sine and inverse sine transforms matching these boundary conditions are known as DST-II and\nDST-III formulae, respectively, these are available in many numerical libraries [69]. We introduce a lattice spacing a,\nwhich is related to\u0001 the the highest stored momentum by \u039b = \u03c0/a, the space points where we will have to use Eq. (D2)\nare xn = a n + 12 , with n = 0..N \u2212 1. In momentum space we define the momentum grid as kj = (j + 1)\u039b/N , with\nj = 0..N \u2212 1. Since on a one-dimensional lattice of physical size L the momentum space lattice spacing is 2\u03c0/L, the\ncorresponding \"box size\" in our discretisation is L = 2aN . With these notations the transformation rules read:\n\"N \u22121 \u0012\n\u0012 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0013#\nX\n\u03c0\n1  \u0303\n1\n,\nfn sin\nn+\nn+\n(k + 1)\n2\nN\n2\nn=0\n\u0014\n1\n(\u22121)n\nf \u0303n =\nN fN \u22121\n2\n2N 2 a3 (n + 21 )\n\u0013\n\u0013#\n\u0012 \u0012\nN\n\u22122\nX\n1\n\u03c0\nn+\n(k + 1)\n.\n+\n(k + 1) fk sin\nN\n2\nN\nfk = 4a\nk+1\n3\n\n(D4)\n\n(D5)\n\nk=0\n\nAs we have already mentioned, the zero momentum and the equal time propagators are not stored at all, so we\nneed separate formulae for the volume integrals:\n#\nN\n\u22122\nX\nN2\n2\nfN \u22121 +\n(k + 1) fk ,\n2\n0\nk=0\n\u00132\nZ aN\nN\n\u22121 \u0012\nX\n1\n3  \u0303\n3\nn+\nd xf (x) = 4\u03c0a\nf \u0303n .\n2\n0\nn=0\n\nZ\n\n\u039b\n\n\u03c0\nd3 k\nf (k)=\n3\n(2\u03c0)\n2(aN )3\n\n\"\n\n(D6)\n\n(D7)\n\n\f17\nWe used this kind of cut-off discretisation in our presented numerics.

Johnson, Proceedings of the IEEE 93 (2) (2005) 216-231.\n[70] In the case of a complex scalar field one needs to introduce two Wightman functions G> (x, y) \u2261 h\u03c6(x)\u03c6\u2020 (y)i\u03b2\nand G< (x, y) \u2261 h\u03c6\u2020 (y)\u03c6(x)i\u03b2 . In the present case, because the field is real, these two functions are related by\nG< (x, y) = G> (y, x).\nR\n[71] We define the Fourier transform of G> (x) by G> (p) \u2261 d4 x eipx G> (x).\n[72] Notice that G(x, y) is the connected part of the contour-ordered propagator. In what follows we shall work in the situation\nwhere \u03c6(x) vanishes and then both functions coincide.\n[73] Including the counterterms \u03b4Zt and \u03b4Zs presents no difficulty in principle.\n[74] Notice that the time evolution corresponding to a Gaussian initial condition, see previous section, can also be recast in\nterms of a source and one might wonder why it is not possible to follow the same strategy. The problem in that case is\nthat the propagator at vanishing source has the incorrect (perturbative) asymptotics.\n[75] One can for example consider the difference \u039bE (p, p\u2032 , q) \u2212 \u039bE (p, \u2212p, q) and expand in powers of p\u2032 + p. Each power of\np + p\u2032 decreases the degree of divergence, and the only dangerous (p + p\u2032 )0 contribution is absent.\n[76] Notice that this condition enforces a particular dependence of K(p, q) as p \u2212 q becomes large, for fixed u = p + q.\n[77] For simple truncations it is advantageous to calculate in direct space: for example, the setting-sun diagram contributes a\nterm \u2212\u03bb2 /6 G3E (x) to the self-energy.\n[78] Since the goal is here to determine \u03b4\u03bbE , it is enough to consider Eq. (35) for VE\u22c6 (p\u22c6 , q) at temperature T = T \u22c6 . This\nequation is closed meaning that it does not involve VE\u22c6 (p, q) at any other value of p but p = p\u22c6 .\n[79] Solve it over a long time interval (few times relaxation time), but you can truncate the memory integral at \u223c 10m\u22121 ,\nwhere m is the relevant mass scale, since \u03a3\u03c1 (t; p\n~) relaxes on the microscopical scale. \u03a3\u03c1 (t; p\n~) is strongly sensitive to volume\nfor t > L/2, L being the physical box size. This also sets a limit to the memory it is meaningful to keep.\n[80] The Fourier transform requires the knowledge of \u03c1(t; p\n~) over an infinite period. In practice, F (t, p\n~) will be accurate enough\nin the initial period if we have \u03c1(t; p\n~) over a few relaxation times only.\n\n\f"}
