It is a nice (crepant)\nresolution of singularities of the n-fold symmetric power S (n) of S. If S is a K3\nsurface or an abelian surface, then S [n] is a compact, holomorphic symplectic (thus\nhyperk\u00e4hler) manifold. Thus S [n] is at the same time a basic example of a moduli\nspace and an example of a nice resolution of singularities of a singular variety. There\nare a number of conjectures and general phenomena, many of which originating from\ntheoretical physics, both about moduli spaces for objects on surfaces and about nice\nresolutions of singularities. In all of these the Hilbert scheme of points can be viewed\nas a model case and sometimes as the main motivating example. Hilbert schemes\nof points on a surface have connections to many topics in mathematics, including\nmoduli spaces of sheaves and vector bundles, Donaldson invariants, Gromov-Witten\ninvariants and enumerative geometry of curves, infinite dimensional Lie algebras and\nvertex algebras, noncommutative geometry and also theoretical physics.\n\u2217 Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Strada Costiera 11, 34014 Trieste,\nItaly. E-mail: gottsche@ictp.trieste.it\n\n\f484\n\nL. G\u00f6ttsche\n\nIt is usually best to look at the Hilbert schemes S [n] for all n at the same\ntime, and to study their invariants in terms of generating functions, because new\nstructures emerge this way. For Euler numbers, Betti numbers and conjecturally\nfor the elliptic genus these generating functions will be modular forms and Jacobi\nforms. This fits into general conjectures from physics about invariants of moduli\nspaces. Also the cohomology rings of the S [n] for different n are closely tied together.\nThe direct sum over n of all the cohomologies is a representation for the Heisenberg\nalgebra modeled on the cohomology of S, and the cohomology rings of the S [n] can\nbe described in terms of vertex operators. In the case that the canonical divisor of\nthe surface S is trivial, this leads to an elementary description of the cohomology\nrings of the S [n] , which coincides with the orbifold cohomology ring of the symmetric\npower, giving a nontrivial check of a conjecture relating the cohomology ring of a\nnice resolution of an orbifold to the recently defined orbifold cohomology ring.\nThe Hilbert schemes S [n] are closely related to other moduli spaces of objects\non S, including moduli of vector bundles and moduli of curves e.g. via the Serre\ncorrespondence and the Mukai Fourier transform. This leads to applications to the\ngeometry and topology of these moduli spaces, to Donaldson invariants, and also\nto formulas in the enumerative geometry of curves on surfaces and Gromov-Witten\ninvariants. We want to explain some of these results and connections. We will not\nattempt to give a complete overview, but rather give a glimpse of some of the more\nstriking results.\n\n1.\n\nThe Hilbert scheme of points\n\nIn this article S will usually be a smooth projective surface over the complex\nnumbers. We will study the Hilbert scheme S [n] = Hilbn (S) of subschemes of length\nn on S. The points of S [n] correspond to finite subschemes W \u2282 S of length n,\nin particular a general point corresponds just to a set of n distinct points on S.\nS [n] is projective and comes with a universal family Zn (S) \u2282 S [n] \u00d7 S, consisting of\nthe (W, x) with x \u2208 W . An important role in applications of S [n] is played by the\ntautological vector bundles L[n] := \u03c0\u2217 q \u2217 (L) of rank n on S [n] . Here \u03c0 : Zn (S) \u2192 S [n]\nand q : Zn (S) \u2192 S are the projections and L is a line bundle on S.\nClosely related to S [n] is the symmetric power S (n) = S n /Gn , the quotient\nn\n(n)\nof S by the action\ncorrespond to\nP of the symmetric group Gn . The points of S\neffective 0-cycles\nni [xi ], where the xi are distinct points of S and the sum of the\nni is n. The forgetful map\nX\n\u03c1 : S [n] \u2192 S (n) , W 7\u2192\nlen(\u00d8W,x )[x]\nx\u2208S\n\nis a morphism. The symmetric power S (n) is singular, as for instance the fix-locus of\nany transposition in Gn has codimension 2. On the other hand by [22] S [n] is smooth\nand connected of dimension 2n and \u03c1 : S [n] \u2192 S (n) is a resolution of singularities.\nIn fact this is a particularly nice resolution: If Y is a Gorenstein variety, i.e. the\ndualizing sheaf is a line bundle KY , a resolution f : X \u2192 Y of singularities is called\ncrepant if it preserves the canonical divisor, that is f \u2217 KY = KX . It is easy to see\n\n\fHilbert Schemes of Points on Surface\n\n485\n\nthat \u03c1 : S [n] \u2192 S (n) is crepant. In the special case that S is an abelian surface or a\nK3 surface one can get a better result: A complex manifold X is called holomorphic\nsymplectic if there exists an everywhere non-degenerate holomorphic 2-form \u03c6 on\nX. If furthermore \u03c6 is unique up to scalar, X is called irreducible holomorphic\nsymplectic. A K\u00e4hler manifold X of real dimension 4n is called hyperk\u00e4hler if its\nholonomy group is Sp(n). Compact complex manifolds are holomorphic symplectic\nif and only of they admit a hyperk\u00e4hler metric. In [7] it is shown that for a K3 surface\nS the Hilbert scheme S [n] is irreducible holomorphic symplectic. There also, for\nan abelian surface A, the generalized Kummer varieties are constructed from A[n] .\nThey form another series of irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds. The only\nother examples of compact hyperk\u00e4hler manifolds, known not to be diffeomorphic\nto one in the above two series are the two isolated examples of resolutions of singular\nmoduli spaces of sheaves on K3 and abelian surfaces in [47],[48].\n\n2.\n\nBetti number, Euler numbers, elliptic genus\n\nFor many questions about the Hilbert schemes S [n] one should look at all\nn at the same time. The first instance of this are the Betti numbers and Euler\nnumbers, \bfor which we can find generating functions in terms of modular forms.\nLet H := \u03c4 \u2208 C I(\u03c4 ) > 0 . A modular form of weight k on Sl(2, Z) is a function\nf : H \u2192 C s.th.\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\na\u03c4 + b\na b\nk\n= (c\u03c4 + d) f (\u03c4 ),\n\u2208 Sl(2, Z).\nf\nc d\nc\u03c4 + b\nFurthermore, writing q = e2\u03c0i\u03c4 , we require that, in the Fourier development f (\u03c4 ) =\nP\nn\nn\u2208Z an q , all the the negative Fourier coefficients vanish. If also a0 = 0, f\nis called aQcusp form. The most well-known modular form is the discriminant\n\u2206(\u03c4 ) := q n>0 (1 \u2212 q n )24 , the unique cusp form of weight 12. The Dirichlet eta\nfunction is \u03b7 = \u22061/24 .\nP\nFor a manifold X we denote by p(X, z) := i (\u22121)i bi (X)z i the Poincar\u00e9 polynomial and by e(X) = p(X, 1) the Euler number. The Betti numbers and Euler\nnumbers of the S [n] have very nice generating functions [24]:\nX\n\nn\u22650\n\np(S [n] , z)tn =\n\n4\nYY\n\n(1 \u2212 z 2k\u22122+i tk )(\u22121)\n\ni+1\n\nbi (S)\n\n.\n\n(2.1)\n\nk\u22651 i=0\n\nP\nIn particular n\u22650 e(S [n] )q n\u2212e(S)/24 = \u03b7(\u03c4 )\u2212e(S) .\nThis was first shown in [19] in the case of the projective plane and of Hirzebruch\nsurfaces using a natural C\u2217 action. The proof in [24] uses the Weil Conjectures.\nAn important role in this proof as in all subsequent generalizations and refinements\nis played by the following natural stratification of S [n] and S (n) parametrized by\nthe set P (n) of partitions of n. For a partition \u03b1 = (n1 , . . . , nr ) \u2208 P (n), the\n(n)\ncorresponding locally closed stratum S\u03b1 of S (n) consists of the set of zero cycles\n[n]\n(n)\nn1 [x1 ] + . . . + nr [xr ] with x1 , . . . , xr distinct points of S. We put S\u03b1 = \u03c1\u22121 (S\u03b1 ).\n\n\f486\n\nL. G\u00f6ttsche\n\nn\u03b1n ),\nA partition \u03b1 = (n1 , . . . , nr ) \u2208 P (n) can also be written as \u03b1 = (1\u03b11 , . . . ,P\nwhere \u03b1i is the number of occurences of i in (n1 , . . . , nr ). We put |\u03b1| = r =\n\u03b1i .\nThen (2.1) can be reformulated as\np(S [n] , z) =\n\nX\n\np(S (\u03b11 ) \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 S (\u03b1n ) , z)z 2(n\u2212|\u03b1|).\n\n(2.2)\n\n\u03b1\u2208P (n)\n\nThis result has been refined to Hodge numbers in [30], [11] and this was generalized\nin [13] to the Douady space of a complex surface. It has been further refined to\ndetermine the motive and the Chow groups [14] and the element in the Grothendieck\ngroup of varieties of S [n] [28].\nPartially motivated by (2.1) and using arguments from physics in [15] a conjectural refinement to the Krichever-H\u00f6hn elliptic genus is given. We restrict our\nattention to the case that KX = 0 when the elliptic genus is a Jacobi form. For a\ncomplex vector bundle E on a complex manifold X and a variable t we put\nM\nM\n\u039bt (E) :=\n\u039bk (E)tk , St (E) :=\nS k (E)tk .\nk\u22650\n\nk\u22650\n\nP\nFor the holomorphic Euler characteristic we write \u03c7(X, \u039bt (E)) :=\n\u03c7(X, \u039bk E)tk\nand similarly for St (E).

(3.1)\nS\n\nWe can interpret this as follows. Let L\nH = H+ \u2295 H\u2212 be\nLthe decomposition into even\nand odd cohomology. Put S \u2217 (H) := i\u22650 S i (H+ ) \u2297 i\u22650 \u039bi (H\u2212 ). The Fock space\nassociated to H is F (H) := S \u2217 (H \u2297 tQ[t]). Using the above theorems one readily\nshows that there is an isomorphism of graded vector spaces F (H) \u2192 H. With this\nH becomes an irreducible module under the Heisenberg-Clifford algebra.\nThe ring structure of the H \u2217 (S [n] ) is connected to the Heisenberg algebra\naction. Given an action of a Heisenberg algebra, a standard construction gives\nan action of the corresponding Virasoro algebra. The important fact however,\nproven in [37] is that the Virasoro algebra generators have a geometrical interpretation tying them to the ring structure of the cohomology of the S [n] . Let\n\u03b4 : S \u2192 S \u00d7 S be the diagonal embedding, and let \u03b4\u2217 : H \u2217 (S) \u2192 H \u2217 (S \u00d7 S) be\nthe corresponding pushforward. Let p\u03bd pn\u2212\u03bd \u03b4(\u03b1) : H \u2217 (S) \u2192 End(H) be defined\nas p\u03bd pn\u2212\u03bd (\u03b2\n\u03b4\u2217 (\u03b1) \u2208 H \u00d7 H.

The tie given in [37] to the ring structure is:\n\u0012 \u0013\nn\n[\u2202, pn (\u03b1)] = nLn (a) +\npn (KS a),\nn \u2265 0, \u03b1 \u2208 H \u2217 (S).\n(3.3)\n2\nIn [42], for each \u03b1 \u2208 H \u2217 (S), classes \u03b1[n] \u2208 H \u2217 (S [n] ) are defined as generatizations\nof the Chern characters ch(F [n] ) of tautological bundles, which are studied in [37].\nThe homogeneous components of the \u03b1[n] generate the ring H \u2217 (S [n] ). [37],[42]\nrelate the multiplication by the \u03b1[n] to the higher order commutators with \u2202: Let\n\u03b1[\u2022] : H \u2192 H be the operator which on every H \u2217 (S [n] ) is the multiplication with\n\u03b1[n] , then\n[\u03b1[\u2022] , p1 (\u03b2)] = exp(ad(\u2202))p1 (\u03b1\u03b2),\n(3.4)\nwhere for an operator A : H \u2192 H, ad(\u2202)A = [\u2202, A].\n(3.2),(3.3),(3.4) determine the cohomology rings of the S [n] . In case KS = 0\nthis is used in [38],[39] to give an elementary description of the cohomology rings\nH \u2217 (S [n] ) in terms of the symmetric group, which we will relate below to orbifold\ncohomology rings.\n\n\f488\n\n4.\n\nL. G\u00f6ttsche\n\nOrbifolds and orbifold cohomology\n\nLet X be a compact complex manifold with an action of a finite group G and\nassume that for all 1 6= g \u2208 G the fixlocus X g has codimension \u2265 2. The quotient\nX/G will usually be singular, but the stack quotient [X/G] is a smooth orbifold. In\nphysics [16],[17] the following orbifold Euler characteristic has been introduced\nX\nX\ne(X g /C(g)).\ne(X, G) :=\ne(X g,h ) =\ngh=hg\u2208G\n\n[g]\u2282G\n\nHere the first sum runs over all commuting pairs in G and X g,h is the set of common\nfixpoints; the second sum runs over the conjugacy classes [g] of elements in G and\nC(g) is the centralizer of g. If Y \u2192 X/G is a crepant resolution, then it was\nexpected that e(X, G) = e(Y ). As the conjugacy classes of the symmetric group\nGn correspond to the partitions of n, one can see [33] using formula (2.2) that this\nis true for the resolution of S (n) by S [n] , which was an important check for this\nconjecture.\nOrbifold Euler numbers have been refined to orbifold cohomology groups [60].\nWe again take all cohomology with Q coefficients. Define a rationally graded Qvector space\nM\n\u2217\nH \u2217 (X g /C(g)).\nHorb\n([X/G]) :=\n[g]\u2282G\n\nThe grading is defined as follows. Assume for simplicity that all X g are connected.\nP\nFor x \u2208 X g let e2\u03c0ir1 , . . . , e2\u03c0irk be the eigenvalues of g on TX,x . Put a(g) := ri \u2208\nQ where ri \u2208 [0, 1). This is independent of x. For \u03b1 \u2208 H i (X g /C(g)) its degree in\n\u2217\nthe [g]-th summand of Horb\n([X/G]) is i + 2a(g). If X/G is Gorenstein, then it is\neasy to see that a(g) \u2208 Z\u22650 . For crepant resolutions Y \u2192 X/G, it was conjectured\n\u2217\nthat Horb\n([X/G]) = H \u2217 (Y ) as graded vector spaces. In the case of S [n] \u2192 S (n)\nthis can again be verified from formula (2.2). In [6] it has been established for all\ncrepant resolutions Y \u2192 X/G.\nRecently orbifold cohomology rings, i.e. a ring structure on the orbifold cohomology have been defined as a special case of quantum cohomology of orbifolds\n[12],[2],[1]. In [50] it is conjectured for an orbifold X with a hyperk\u00e4hler resolution\nY \u2192 X, i.e. a crepant resolution such that Y is hyperk\u00e4hler, that the orbifold\ncohomology ring of X is isomorphic to H \u2217 (Y ). The most relevant case of such a\nresolution is S [n] \u2192 S (n) when KS = 0. This is precisely the case in which [39]\ngives an elementary description of the cohomology ring of S [n] . In [21],[52] an elementary description of the orbifold cohomology\nof a quotient [X/G] by a finite\nP\n\u2217\ng\ngroup is given. We define H \u2217 (X, G) :=\ng\u2208G H (X ). This carries a G-action\nby h * \u03b1g = (h\u2217 \u03b1)hgh\u22121 , and, for a suitable grading on H \u2217 (X, G), it follows that\n\u2217\n([X/G]) as a graded vector space. In order to\nthe G invariant part is just Horb\n\u2217\ndefine the ring structure on Horb ([X/G]) one therefore defines a ring structure on\nH \u2217 (X, G) compatible with the G-action. In [39] the cohomology ring H \u2217 (S [n] ) is\nalso described as the Gn invariant part of a ring structure on H \u2217 (S n , Gn ) and one\nchecks that the two ring structures on H \u2217 (S n , Gn ) coincide up to an explicit sign\nchange, thus proving the conjecture of [50] for S [n] .\n\n\fHilbert Schemes of Points on Surface\n\n489\n\nIf \u03c0 : Y \u2192 X/G is only a crepant resolution but not hyperk\u00e4hler, then usually\n\u2217\nHorb\n([X/G]) and H \u2217 (Y ) are not isomorphic as rings. However in [51] a precise\n\u2217\nconjecture is made relating the two: One has to correct Horb\n([X/G]) by GromovWitten invariants coming from classes of rational curves Y contracted by \u03c0. In the\ncase of the Hilbert scheme these curve classes are the multiples of a unique class.\nThe conjecture was verified for S [2] .\n\n5.\n\nModuli of vector bundles\n\nWe denote by MSH (r, c1 , c2 ) the moduli space of Gieseker H-semistable coherent sheaves of rank r on S with Chern classes c1 , c2 . Here a sheaf F of rank r > 0 on\nS is called semistable, if \u03c7(G \u2297 H n )/r\u2032 \u2264 \u03c7(F \u2297 H n )/r for all sufficiently large n and\nfor all subsheaves G \u2282 F of positive rank r\u2032 . As MSH (1, 0, c2 ) \u2243 P ic0 (S) \u00d7 S [c2 ] , the\nHilbert scheme of points is a special case. We will often restrict our attention to the\ncase of r = 2 and write MSH (c1 , c2 ). The Hilbert schemes of points are related in several ways to the MSH (c1 , c2 ). The most basic tie is the Serre correspondence which\nsays that under mild assumptions rank two vector bundles on S can be constructed\nas extensions of ideal sheaves of finite subschemes by line bundles. Related to this\nis the dependence of the MSH (c1 , c2 ) on the ample divisor H via a system of walls\nand chambers. This has been studied by a number of authors (e.g. [49],[23],[18]).\nAssume for simplicity that S is simply connected. A class \u03be \u2208 H 2 (S, Z) defines a\nwall of type (c1 , c2\b) if \u03be + c1 \u2208 2H 2 (S, Z) and c21 \u2212 4c2 \u2264 \u03be 2 < 0. The corresponding wall is W \u03be = \u03b1 \u2208 H 2 (S, R) \u03b1 * \u03be = 0 . The connected components of the\ncomplement of the walls in H 2 (X, R) are called the chambers of type (c1 , c2 ). If a\nsheaf E \u2208 MSH (c1 , c2 ) is unstable with respect to L, then there is a wall W \u03be with\nH\u03be < 0 < L\u03be and an extension\n0 \u2192 IZ \u2297 A \u2192 E \u2192 IW \u00d7 B \u2192 0,\nwhere A, B \u2208 P ic(S) with A \u2212 B = \u03be and IZ , IW are the ideal sheaves of zero\ndimensional schemes on S. It follows that MSH (c1 , c2 ) depends only on the chamber\nof H and the set theoretic change under wallcrossing is given in terms of Hilbert\nschemes of points on S. In the case e.g. of rational surfaces and K3-surfaces,\nthe change can be described as an explicit sequence of blow ups along Pk bundles\nover products S [n] \u00d7 S [m] followed by blow downs in another direction [23],[18].\nThe change of the Betti and Hodge numbers under wallcrossing can be explicitly\ndetermined and this can be used e.g. to determine the Hodge numbers of MSH (c1 , c2 )\nfor rational surfaces. For suitable choices of H one can find the generating functions\nin terms of modular forms and Jacobi forms [27].\nThe appearance of modular forms is in accord with the S-duality conjectures\n[54] from theoretical physics, which predict that under suitable assumptions the\ngenerating functions for the the Euler numbers of moduli spaces of sheaves on\nsurfaces should be given by modular forms. One of the motivating examples for\nthis conjecture is the case that S is a K3-surface. In this case the conjecture is that,\nif MSH (c1 , c2 ) is smooth, then it has the same Betti numbers as the Hilbert scheme of\npoints on S of the same dimension. Assuming this, the formula (2.1) for the Hilbert\n\n\f490\n\nL. G\u00f6ttsche\n\nschemes of points implies that the generating function for the Euler numbers is a\nmodular form. If c1 is primitive this was shown in [29]. The result was shown in\ngeneral for MSH (r, c1 , c2 ) with r > 0 in [57],[59], by relating the Hilbert scheme and\nthe moduli space via birational correspondences and deformations. One concludes\nthat MSH (r, c1 , c2 ) has the same Betti numbers as the Hilbert scheme of points of\nthe same dimension, as both spaces are holomorphic symplectic [44] and birational\nmanifolds with trivial canonical class have the same Betti numbers [5]. Similar\nresults are shown in [58] for abelian surfaces. Other motivating examples for the\nS-duality conjecture were the case of P2 [56] and the blowup formula relating the\ngenerating function for the Euler numbers of the moduli spaces of rank 2 sheaves on\na surface S to that on the blowup of S in a point, which has since been established\n([40],[41], see also [27]).\nThe moduli spaces MSH (c1 , c2 ) can be used to compute the Donaldson invariants of S. In case pg = 0 these depend on a metric, corresponding to the dependence\nof MSH (c1 , c2 ) on H. For rational surfaces one can use the above description of the\nwallcrossing for the MSH (c1 , c2 ) to determine the change of the Donaldson invariants in terms of Chern numbers of generalizations of the tautological sheaves L[n]\non products S [n] \u00d7 S [m] of Hilbert schemes of points [18],[23]. The leading terms\nof these expressions can be explicitly evaluated. The wallcrossing of Donaldson\ninvariants has also been studied in gauge theory (e.g.[35],[36]). There a conjecture\nabout the structure of the wallcrossing formulas is made. Assuming this conjecture\none can determine the generating functions for the wallcrossing in terms of modular\nforms [25],[31].\n\n6.\n\nEnumerative geometry of curves\n\nNow we want to see some striking relations between the Hilbert schemes S [n]\nand the enumerative geometry of curves on S. First let S be a K3 surface and\nL a primitive line bundle on S. Then L2 = 2g \u2212 2, where the linear system |L|\nhas dimension g and a smooth curve in |L| has geometric genus g. As a node\nimposes one linear condition, one expects a finite number of rational curves (i.e.\ncurves of geometric genus 0) in |L|. Partially based on arguments from physics, a\nformula is given in [55] for the number of rational curves in |L| and in [8] this made\nmathematically precise. Writing ng for the number of rational curves in |L| with\nL2 = 2g \u2212 2 (counted with suitable multiplicities), the formula is\nX\nq\n(6.1)\nng q g = ,\n\u2206\ng\u22650\n\nwhere \u2206 is again the discriminant. By (2.1) this implies the surprizing fact that ng\nis just the Euler number of S [g] . In fact the argument relates the number of curves\nto S [g] : Let C \u2192 |L| be the universal curve and let J \u2192 |L| be the corresponding\nrelative compactified Jacobian, whose fibre over the point corresponding to a curve\nC is the compactified Jacobian J(C) [3]. One can show that e(J(C)) = 0 unless\ng(C) = 0. It follows that e(J ) is the sum over the e(J(C)) for C \u2208 |L| with\ng(C) = 0. It is not difficult to show that S [g] and J are birational. J is also smooth\n\n\fHilbert Schemes of Points on Surface\n\n491\n\nand hyperk\u00e4hler as a moduli space of sheaves on a K3 surface [44]. As already used\nin the section on vector bundles, birational manifolds with trivial canonical bundle\nhave the same Betti numbers [5]. Thus J and S [g] have the same Euler numbers.\nThis shows (6.1), where the multiplicity of a rational curve C is e(J(C)). By [20]\nthis multiplicity is the multiplicity of the corresponding moduli space of stable maps,\nin particular it is always positive. In [26] a conjectural generalization of (6.1) to\narbitrary surfaces S is given.\nConjecture 6.1\n1. For all \u03b4 \u2265 0, there exists a universal polynomial T\u03b4 (x, y, z, w), such that for\nall projective surfaces S and all sufficiently ample line bundles L on S the\nnumber of \u03b4-nodal curves in a general \u03b4-dimensional linear subspace of |L| is\nT\u03b4 (\u03c7(L), \u03c7(\u00d8S ), LKS , KS2 ).\n2. There are universal power series B1 , B2 \u2208 Z[[q]] whose coefficients can be\nexplicitely determined, such that\nK2\n\nX\n\nT\u03b4 (\u03c7(L), \u03c7(\u00d8S ), LKS , KS2 )(DG2 )\u03b4\n\n\u03b4\u22650\n\n(DG2 /q)\u03c7(L) B1LKS B2 S\n.\n=\n(\u2206D2 G2 /q 2 )\u03c7(\u00d8S )/2\n\nd\n1 D\u2206\nHere D = q dq\nand G2 = \u2212 24\n\u2206 .\n\nThe expectation that universal polynomials should exist is implicit in [53],[34]\nwhere the T\u03b4 are determined for \u03b4 \u2264 8. In [26] also another tie of the conjecture to\nthe Hilbert scheme of points is given: conjecturally the numbers T\u03b4 (\u03c7(L), \u03c7(\u00d8S ),\nLKS , KS2 ) are suitable intersection numbers on the Hilbert scheme S [3\u03b4] of 3\u03b4 points\nof S. If S is a K3 surface or an abelian surface, then the conjecture predicts that\nthe generating function can be written in terms of modular forms. In this case\na modified version of Conjecture 6.1 was proven for primitive line bundles in [9]\nand [10], replacing the numbers of \u03b4-nodal curves with the corresponding modified\nGromov-Witten invariants. In [43] a proof of the conjecture is published.\n\nReferences\n[1] D. Abramovich, T. Graber, A. Vistoli, Algebraic orbifold quantum products,\npreprint math.AG/0112004.\n[2] D. Abramovich, A.
