We take advantage of interferometric measurements of Achernar\nto inquire on its internal rotational law. The reinterpretation of interferometric data and the use of fundamental parameters corrected for gravitational\ndarkening effects and models of 2D-models of internal stellar structures, lead\nus to the conclusion that the star could not be a rigid, near critical, rotator\nbut a differential rotator with the core rotating \u223c 3 times faster than the\nsurface.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nAchernar (\u03b1 Eri, HD 10144) is the brightest Be star in the sky and as such it\nhas deserved detailed observations. Of particular interest are the \u03bb 2.2 \u03bcm interferometric observations carried out by Domiciano de Souza et al. (2003), which\ntogether with spectroscopic and spectrophotometric measurements enable us to\ninquire on what internal rotational law can account for its geometrical deformation.\n2\n\nMethod and models\n\nAchernar is an active Be star, even during a quiescent or apparent non-emission\nphase. The star had a small H\u03b1 emission at the epoch of interferometric measurements (Vinicius et al. 2005), which imnplies a flux excess at \u03bb 2.2 \u03bcm of rougly 20%\nproduced by a circumstellar disc. We may assume, however, that interferometry\ncarried in the stellar polar directions are free from disc perturbations. The actual\nstellar equatorial radius can then be estimated requiring apparent area conservaapp\n2\ntion: Rsph\n= Rpole\n(i) \u00d7 Requat , where Rsph is the radius of the equivalent circular\nstellar disc derived by comparing measured fluxes with model atmospheres. The\napp\nrelation between the apparent i-dependent interferometric polar radius Rpole\n(i)\nand the true stellar polar radius Rpole is given by:\n1\n2\n3\n\nInstitut d'Astrophysique de Paris, UMR7095 CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Pierre & Marie Curie\nLaboratoire Univ. d'Astroph. de Nice (LUAN), UMR 6525 CNRS\nRoyal Observatory of Belgium\nc EDP Sciences 2005\n\n\f2\n\nSF2A 2005\n\n\u0002\napp\nRpole\n(i)/Requat = {1 \u2212 1 \u2212 (Rpole /Requat )2 ]2 sin2 i}1/2\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere i is the inclination angle. The use of the V sin i parameter corrected for\ngravitational darkening effects enables us to discuss the stellar rotational distortion\nas a function of the internal rotation law and of the amount of stored angular\nmomentum. Inspired by model predictions of rotating stars by Meynet & Maeder\n(2000), we adopt the internal rotational law given by:\n\u03a9(r)/\u03a9core = 1 \u2212 p.e\u2212a.r\n\nb\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere p determines the \u03a9core /\u03a9surf ratio; b determines the steepness of the drop\nfrom \u03a9core to \u03a9surf ; a depends on the size or the core. 2D-models of stellar interiors\nwere used to determine the changes of the polar and equatorial radii as a function\nof the energy ratio \u03c4 = kinetic energy/|gravitational potential energy| for a star\nwith mass M = 6.7 \u00b1 0.4M\u2299 near the end of the MS phase (Vinicius et al. 2005).\n3\n\nResults\n\nThe use of (2.1) and Requat /R\u2299 against \u03c4 enables us to compare the observed\n(Requat /R\u2299 , Requat /Rpole , V sin i) with the model predicted ones and determine:\n\uf8fc\np\n= 0.624 \u00b1 0.001 \uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u03c4\n= 0.014 \u00b1 0.001 \uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n\u03b7\n=\n0.69 \u00b1 0.07\n(3.1)\nVe\n= 308 \u00b1 16km/s \uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\no\no\n\uf8f4\ni\n=\n52 \u00b1 4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n\u03a9core /\u03a9surf =\n2.7\n\nwith \u03b7 = Re3 \u03a92e /GM = ratio of centrifugal to gravity accelerations. The force ratio\nis \u03b7 < 1 which indicates that the stellar equator is not at critical rotation. We\nnote that for a plain rigid rotation approximation, Achernar would have \u03a9/\u03a9crit =\n0.8, which corresponds to \u03b7rigid = 0.66.\nIt is interesting to note that the energy ratio \u03c4 = 0.014 of our differential\nrotator is quite similar to the value of critical rigid rotators: \u03c4c = 0.015. In the\nrigid rotation approximation the star would have \u03c4r = 0.011, which implies that\nAchernar is possibly storing 30% more rotational energy that it would have if it\nwere at rigid rotation.\nReferences\nDomiciano de Souza, A., Kervella, P., Jankov, S. et al. 2000, A&A, 407, L47\nMeynet, G., Maeder.
