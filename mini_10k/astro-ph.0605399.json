Barthel 1989; Urry & Padovani 1995),\nand for understanding the fuelling of the radio activity. At\nradio wavelengths, the ionized component of this gas may\nbe probed via radio polarization measurements of compact\ncomponents in sources which reside within the dense interstellar environments of the parent galaxies. Such sources are\nthe radio cores, and the compact steep-spectrum (CSS) and\ngigahertz peaked-spectrum (GPS) sources. The CSS sources\nare defined to be those with a projected linear size <\n\u223c15\nkpc (Ho =71 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9m =0.27, \u03a9\u039b =0.73, Spergel\net al. 2003) and having a steep high-frequency radio spec\u2212\u03b1\ntrum (\u03b1>\n\u223c0.5, where S(\u03bd) \u221d \u03bd ). The GPS sources are more\n<\ncompact and have sizes \u223c1 kpc (O'Dea 1998). An important\nway of probing the atomic gas on sub-galactic scales is by\nstudying 21-cm Hi absorption towards the compact compo-\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail:neeraj@ncra.tifr.res.in (NG); djs@ncra.tifr.res.in (DJS)\n\nnents of CSS and GPS objects, or the compact radio nuclei\nof the larger objects (e.g. van Gorkom et al. 1989; Conway\n& Blanco 1995; Peck et al. 2000; Pihlstr\u00f6m 2001; Vermeulen\net al. 2003; Pihlstr\u00f6m et al. 2003; Gupta et al. 2006).\nThe Hi absorption lines associated with CSS and GPS\nobjects exhibit a variety of line profiles, suggesting significant, sometimes complex, gas motions, while the Hi column\ndensities have been found to be anti-correlated with source\nsizes (Vermeulen et al. 2003; Pihlstr\u00f6m et al. 2003; Gupta\net al. 2006). Pihlstr\u00f6m et al. have explored different distributions of the Hi gas density to explain this observed anticorrelation, and find that a disk as well as a spherical distribution are consistent with it. To study some of these aspects\nand to test for consistency with the unification scheme, we\nexamine the dependence of Hi column density on relative\nprominence of the core, fc , which is being used as a statistical measure of the orientation of the source axis to the line\nof sight (Orr & Browne 1982; Kapahi & Saikia 1982).

CSS and GPS sources such as J1347+1217\n(4C+12.50) and J1407+2827 (Mrk668, OQ208), which have\nprominent Hi absorption lines and well-defined radio structures have not been included because they are classifed as\nSeyferts in the literature (e.g. Hurt et al. 1999; Gallimore\net al. 1999). The radio source J1415+1320 (OQ122) which\nhas an Hi absorption line (Carilli et al. 1992) but has been\nidentified as a BL Lac object possibly residing in a spiral\nhost galaxy (Wurtz, Stocke & Yee 1996) has also not been\nconsidered. For this study, a core is defined to be a compact\nfeature between the two outer lobes of emission. For those\nwithout a detected core, the upper limits to the core flux\ndensity are 3 times the rms noise in the image, and have\nbeen estimated only for those sources whose largest angular\nsize is at least 5 times the resolution element. The fraction of\nemission from the core, fc , or an upper limit to it at an emitted frequency of 8 GHz has been estimated for each source.\nTo estimate this fraction, we have used a spectral index of 0\nand 1 for the core and extended emission respectively, unless\ninformation was available in the literature.\nThe sample consisting of 32 objects of which 14 are GPS\nand 18 are CSS objects is listed in Table 1. 23 of these are\nassociated with galaxies and 9 with quasars. The projected\nlinear size of the sample ranges from 0.02 to 11.3 kpc with a\nmedian value of 0.68 kpc, while the 5-GHz luminosity ranges\nfrom 1.3\u00d71025 to 1.2\u00d71028 W Hz\u22121 with a median value of\n7.6\u00d71026 W Hz\u22121 . The values of fc range from <0.001 to\n0.279 with a median value of 0.011, while those of N(Hi)\n\nDEPENDENCE OF HI COLUMN DENSITY\nON CORE PROMINENCE\n\nTo examine the dependence of Hi column density on core\nprominence and also check for consistency with the unification scheme for radio galaxies and quasars, we plot the\nHi column density against the core fraction (Fig. 1). In our\nsample, there is only one Hi detection for the 9 quasars and\n15 detections for the 23 galaxies, consistent with orientation\neffects playing a significant role in the detection of Hi absorption. The quasars have a higher median value of fc of\n\u223c0.028 compared with 0.011 for the galaxies. These trends\nare broadly consistent with the expectations for the unification scheme.\nOne of the striking features seen in Fig. 1 is that 10\nof the 15 galaxies that have a detected Hi absorption feature, also have a detected radio core, compared with only\n2 out 0f 8 sources without an Hi detection. This suggests\nthat detection of a radio core in galaxies enhances the probability of detecting a 21-cm absorption feature. Dividing the\ngalaxies into two roughly equal groups at the median value\nof fc \u223c0.011, 9 of the 11 with fc >0.011 (i.e. intermediate\nvalues of core fraction) have a detected absorption feature\ncompared with 6 out of 12 detections in the other group\nwith lower values of fc . The median value of N(Hi), using\nupper limits as their values, for the intermediate fc group\nis \u223c3.7\u00d71020 cm\u22122 compared with 1.5\u00d71020 cm\u22122 for the\nlower fc group. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test shows the distributions to be different at a significance level of \u223c95 per\ncent. Thus for galaxies, there is a tendency for the detection\nrate as well as the column density to increase with the degree of core prominence. For the 9 quasars in our sample,\nthere is only one detection and hence it is not meaningful\nto do a similar exercise. But clearly, sources with the lowest\nvalues of fc do not tend to have the higher values of N(Hi).\nIt is important to enquire whether such a trend is consistent with the unification scheme for radio galaxies and\nquasars. The deficit of high column density values for sources\nwith low values of fc can be understood in a scenario where\nthe radio source sizes are larger than the scale of the circumnuclear disk which contributes most of the absorbing gas, so\nthat the line of sight to the lobes at very large inclinations\n(corresponding to small values of fc ) does not intersect the\nHi disk. For intermediate values of fc , one would then expect higher detection rate as well as higher values of N(Hi)\nas seen in Fig. 1. For angles close to the line of sight, which\nwould have the highest values of fc , one would expect small\nvalues of N(Hi) and much lower detection rates due to the\nline of sight passing largely through the ionization cone and\nalso through regions of the disk with a high spin temperature\ndue to the presence of an AGN (Bahcall & Ekers 1969). Such\nsources will usually get classified as compact flat spectrum\n(CFS) sources and not many of them with similar properties\n\n\f4\n\nNeeraj Gupta and D.J. Saikia\n\nFigure 2.

Gupta et al. 2006).\n\n3.1\n\nDependence on linear size\n\nThe neutral hydrogen column density as a function of linear\nsize for our sample of 32 radio sources is shown in Fig. 2.\nThis shows the anti-correlation between the Hi column density and source size reported by Pihlstr\u00f6m et al. (2003) and\nextended to a larger sample of 96 sources by Gupta et al.\n(2006). Thus detection probability of 21-cm absorption feature is higher for both small sources and those with intermediate values of core prominence. It may be noted that\nprojected linear size and fc for this sample show no significant relation.\n\nHI AND SYMMETRY PARAMETERS\n\nIn addition to the circumnuclear disk, absorption could also\noccur in neutral clouds that are part of the gas that has been\naccelerated by interaction with a radio jet. Gas outflows as\nfast and broad as \u223c1000 km s\u22121 have been detected in a\nnumber of radio sources in neutral as well as ionised gas\n(see Morganti, Tadhunter & Oosterloo 2005). The kinematical and spatial properties of these suggest that they are\nbeing driven by the same mechanism i.e. interaction with\nthe expanding radio jets. The dynamical interaction of the\nradio source with these clouds could distort the morphology\nof the radio source thereby affecting the symmetry parameters such as the separation ratio and the misalignment angle.\nThe separation ratio, R\u03b8 , is defined to be the ratio of the\nseparation of the further component from the core to the\nnearer one, while the misalignment angle, \u2206, is defined to\nbe the supplement of the angle formed at the core by the\nouter hotspots. Such jet-cloud interactions may also affect\nthe velocity of the absorbing cloud relative to the systemic\nvelocity of the galaxy. However, we find no evidence of any\nsignificant dependence of the Hi column density as well as\nthe relative velocity of the primary absorption component on\neither the separation ratio or the misalignment angle (Figs. 3\nand 4). But this does not rule out the importance of the role\nplayed by jet-cloud interactions in the observed structures of\nthese sources as there exists significant evidence for this in\nterms of structural, brightness and polarization symmetry\nparameters (Saikia et al. 1995; 2001; Saikia & Gupta 2003).\n\n5\n\nSUMMARY\n\nFor a sample of CSS and GPS objects, we have examined\nthe dependence of Hi column density on the degree of core\nprominence and projected linear size. In our sample, 15 out\nof 23 galaxies exhibit 21-cm absorption as against 1 out of\n9 quasars, which is broadly consistent with the unification\nscheme. The detection rate as well as the Hi column density\nappears to be larger for galaxies with more prominent cores,\n\n\fUnification scheme and neutral gas\nwith the higher column densities occurring in intermediate\nvalues of fc and not in the lowest values of fc . This broad\ntrend can be understood in the unification scheme if the lines\nof sight towards the lobes of sources with the lowest values\nof fc , which are inclined at the largest angles to the line of\nsight, do not pass through the circumnuclear Hi disk. This\ncould happen if the source sizes are larger than the scale of\nthe disk. It is interesting to note that 10 of the 15 galaxies\nwith a detected Hi absorption feature also has a detected\nradio core, compared with 2 out of 8 galaxies without any\nHi detection. Our sample also shows an inverse relationship\nbetween the Hi column density and the projected linear size,\nsuggesting that both small sizes and more prominent cores\nenhance the probability of detecting Hi absorption in CSS\nand GPS objects.\nIn addition to the disk, Hi absorption may also be due to\nclouds of cold gas, some of which may have interacted with\nthe radio jet. We, however, find that the Hi column density\nand the velocity shift of the primary absorption component\nrelative to the systemic velocity show no dependence on the\ndegree of misalignment and the separation ratio.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank an anonymous referee and Ian Browne for several\nuseful comments and suggestions.
