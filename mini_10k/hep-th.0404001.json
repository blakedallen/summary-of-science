On the one hand side\nthere are no high energy experiments testing M-theory in its generic regime (meaning\nwhere all extra dimensions are much smaller than of inverse TeV-scale size) thus rendering cosmology an important 'experimental' alternative. On the other hand one should\nexpect that M-theory in its final formulation will be able to give insight into the origin\nof inflation and ultimately should tell us how to cure the big bang singularity. While the\nlatter problem seems to require first the full microscopic formulation of M-theory for its\nanswer, it seems that the former can already be tackled with current local field theory\napproximations of M-theory in the form of 11d supergravity.\nAs a first important step in this direction we have to find robust mechanisms which\nallow us to obtain 4d de Sitter spacetimes from M-theory. As de Sitter spacetimes with\nlarge unsuppressed cosmological constants are relevant during inflation, even the derivation of de Sitter spacetimes without an accompanied solution to the cosmological constant\nproblem will be important (the solution to the cosmological constant problem seems once\nmore to require a much better understanding of the microscopic M-theory and its degrees\nof freedom which might very well be discrete and finite [1]). In this talk I will focus on\nheterotic M-theory [2] for two reasons. First, heterotic M-theory includes M-theory in\nits bulk and is therefore the more general starting point. Second, due to the E8 gauge\ngroups on its 10d boundaries and various phenomenological virtues (see [3] for a review)\nthis theory seems to be ideal to address cosmology with realistic matter and gauge fields.\nLet's consider therefore heterotic M-theory compactified on CY \u00d7S 1 /Z2 (CY =CalabiYau threefold) from 11d down to 4d. In order to obtain de Sitter vacua we will have to\nbreak supersymmetry. Preferentially, this should happen spontaneously through F-term\nbreaking. To this end the inclusion of non-perturbative effects into the dimensionally\nreduced effective 4d theory will be important. These effects arise either from open membrane instantons (OMI) stretching through the bulk between the two boundaries or from\ngaugino condensation (GC) on the hidden boundary [4] (in more complicated vacua also\nM5-instantons wrapping the complete internal CY threefold could be included and might\neven be required in order to satisfy the anomaly cancelation condition [15]). As these\neffects lead to boundary-boundary forces (for earlier 11d studies of these see [5]) they are\nnatural candidates for a stabilization of the dilaton which in heterotic M-theory corresponds to the orbifold length L. Note that further non-perturbative effects which would\nbe allowed by M-theory, e.g. OMIs wrapping supersymmetric 3-cycles on the internal CY\n1\n\n\fthreefold are not compatible with the supersymmetry preserved by the two boundaries.\nTherefore since we want to start with a supersymmetric configuration in 11d the first two\nnon-perturbative effects are exhausting and indeed have to be included as they cannot\nbe avoided (as to GC note that in heterotic M-theory the strong coupling of the hidden\ngauge group is not an option in contrast to the weakly coupled heterotic string).\nStabilizing the orbifold length by means of OMI's has been considered in [6] for the\nlinearized warped background of [21]. This background solves the 11d gravitino Killingspinor equation to linear order in a series expansion in the warp-factor and it turns\nout that in the regime where this approximative background is valid, OMI's are the\nmost dominant non-perturbative effects [8] while GC is exponentially suppressed against\nthem. It is an important feature of heterotic M-theory that in general it is inconsistent\nto set all G-fluxes to zero. For instance the standard embedding of the spin- into the\ngauge connection no longer leads to a trivial Bianchi identity. Consequently for an 11d\nbackground which preserves 4d, N = 1 supersymmetry the G2,2 (all indices tangent to the\nCY) flux component deforms the background such that the CY volume decreases along\nthe orbifold from visible towards hidden boundary (one could also have an increase which\nhowever doesn't seem to be phenomenologically relevant). It turns out that at the level\nof the effective 4d potential one can stabilize the orbifold modulus L by balancing OMIs\nagainst this non-trivial variation of the background geometry along the orbifold which\nis generated by the G2,2 flux component [6]. However, since the linearized background\nexhibits a linearly decreasing warp-factor and also CY volume one has to introduce an\nadditional M5 brane (4d spacetime-filling and wrapping an internal holomorphic 2-cycle to\npreserve supersymmetry) whose additional G2,2 flux contribution can be used to prevent\nthe metric and therefore the CY volume from becoming negative. This M5 brane gets\nthen stabilized in the middle of the interval [8].\nUnfortunately it turns out that if one wants to study the effective 4d potential for the\norbifold length modulus L at values larger than the stabilized critical one, one enters the\nregime where the metric of the linearized background becomes negative and is therefore\nno longer Riemannian. To cure this state of affairs one should go to the exact non-linear\nbackground which always gives a manifestly positive Riemannian metric and therefore\npositive CY volume [9, 10]. The linearized background is recovered as the tangent approximation to the exact solution at the location of the visible boundary. One then finds\nworking in the exact background and keeping the parallel M5 brane that by considering\nOMI's between the M5 and both boundaries the M5 still gets stabilized at the middle of\nthe orbifold interval. Moreover L can be stabilized again by a balance between a nontriv2\n\n\fUHLL\n-7\n\n2*10\n\n-7\n\n1.5*10\n\n-7\n\n1*10\n\n-8\n\n5*10\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n3\n\n5\n\nL\n\nFigure 1: The 4d potential caused by OMI's in units of the reduced Planck scale as a\nfunction of the orbifold length L = L/l where l = 2\u03c0 1/3 l11 and l11 is the 11d Planck\nlength.\n\nial dependence of the geometry on L (due to G2,2 ) and OMI effects (see fig.1). However,\nhuge CY intersection numbers d & 104 (for the simplest case of a CY with h1,1 = 1)\nare required. Moreover, the volume of the OMIs in Planck units, VOM , turns out to be\nsmaller than 1 at the location of the critical L, thereby unfortunately showing that at the\nminimum one looses control over the supergravity, not to mention that multiply wrapped\ninstantons are no longer suppressed and would contribute as well.\nThe attractive features of the L stabilization so far \u2013 a positive vacuum energy together\nwith spontaneously broken supersymmetry due to F-terms \u2013 can however be kept when\none works in the exact background and takes into account GC [11]. Let us focus here\non the simplest case without additional M5-branes. It is important that in the exact\nbackground there is no longer the need to suppress GC against OMI for consistency\nreasoning of the background. The potential due to OMI's decreases with L while that\ncaused by GC increases which suggests a natural L stabilization mechanism by balancing\nthese two effects against each other (see fig.2). Indeed by working out the full 4d effective\npotential it turns out that this gives a very robust mechanism of stabilizing L which is\n\u00c8WOM\u00c8,\u00c8WGC\u00c8\n-14\n\n1.75*10\n\n-14\n\n1.5*10\n\n-14\n\n1.25*10\n\n-14\n\n1*10\n\n-15\n\n7.5*10\n\n-15\n\n5*10\n\n-15\n\n2.5*10\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2.2\n\nL\n\nFigure 2: The dependence of the absolute values of the open membrane and gaugino\ncondensation superpotentials, |WOM | (left curve) and |WGC | (right curve) on L.\n\n3\n\n\fUHLL\n-69\n\n2.5*10\n\n-69\n\n2*10\n\n-69\n\n1.5*10\n\n-69\n\n1*10\n\n-70\n\n5*10\n9.6\n\n9.8\n\n10.2\n\nL\n\nFigure 3: The 4d potential which results from OMI and GC in units of the reduced Planck\nscale as a function of the orbifold length L. The hidden gauge group chosen is SU(4).\n\nequivalent to stabilizing the dilaton (see fig.3). Without additional M5-branes the exact\nbackground exhibits a naked singularity at a finite Lmax = 1/Gv [10] where Gv measures\nthe visible boundary charge associated to the visible boundary G2,2 flux. However, since\n\u22121/3\nGv \u221d Vv\n(Vv being the visible boundary CY-volume) this upper bound on L is pushed\ntowards infinity in the decompactification limit where Vv \u2192 \u221e. It is therefore possible\nto study this limit and to establish the expected runaway behavior towards a zero energy\ndecompactified flat space. Consequently our local positive energy de Sitter vacua are\nmetastable vacua which will not possess the full maximally de Sitter symmetry. It is\ntherefore likely that their isometry group has finite-dimensional representations, a point\nrecently stressed in [13].\nIt is satisfying that the OMI-GC balancing mechanism does not need very high CYintersection numbers d anymore but works already for d = 1. The stabilized critical\nL0 scales with d as L0 \u221d d1/3 . Moreover, it is essential that now the critical L0 leads\nto values of the CY volume and OMI volume which are much bigger than Planck size\nand therefore show that the vacua lie in a regime where supergravity is under control,\nmeaning that higher order corrections to it are sufficiently suppressed. It turns out that\nbeyond exhibiting a stabilized L, also the S and T axions become fixed and the vacuum\nexpectation value (vev) of the 4d charged matter C fields becomes non-trivial. The vev\nattained by the C's acquires an exponential suppression factor because the minimization\nfor C requires a balancing between the C vev and the two non-perturbative OMI and\nGC effects. It is therefore generic that the C vev lies far below the (reduced) Planck\nscale and can be brought close to the TeV regime. This is interesting as it is one of the\nproblematic features of 4d heterotic string vacua, next to the runaway of the dilaton,\nto give massless charged scalars after supersymmetry breaking through GC (see however\n[12] for a generation of such mass terms through higher dimensional operators; combined\nwith an anomalous U(1) these lead to supersymmetry breaking). It would clearly be\n4\n\n\finteresting to see whether the C vev's could help breaking the visible GUT groups further\ndown to the standard model. Note that in heterotic M-theory there is no reason to prefer\nthe standard embedding of the spin- into the gauge-connection over any non-standard\nembedding. One is therefore not restricted to an E6 GUT group but could also aim to\nobtain SO(10) [14] (which was done in the context of elliptically fibered CY's e.g. in [15])\nor the Pati-Salam group SU(4)c \u00d7SU(2)L \u00d7SU(2)R [16] the two phenomenologically most\nfavored GUT groups [17].\nFurther moduli like the complex structure moduli and the CY-volume modulus are\nexpected to get stabilized once a Neveu-Schwarz G0,3,1 = H0,3 flux component is switched\nR\non and the respective flux superpotential [18] W = CY H0,3 \u2227 \u03a9 is added. This type\nof flux, together with GC and one-loop corrections to the gauge kinetic functions has\ne.g. been used in [19] in the weakly coupled case for the stabilization of complex structure\nand K\u00e4hler moduli. Note that these 'one-loop' corrections appear in heterotic M-theory\nautomatically at 'tree level' and are therefore no longer small. Moreover, since the G0,3,1\nflux component is localized by a delta-function on the boundaries and cannot penetrate\nthe bulk, the situation is indeed very similar to the weakly coupled case. It would of\ncourse also be interesting to switch on the G1,2,1 = H1,2 component leading to non-K\u00e4hler\nmanifolds where one would expect a stabilization of the CY-volume modulus at tree level\n[20]. However, in this case one still has to better understand the moduli structure of these\nnon-K\u00e4hler manifolds before one is able to stabilize them.\nAn interesting property of the resulting de Sitter vacua is the fact that by choosing\nthe hidden gauge group to be of low rank, say SU(4) or SU(3) as opposed to an unbroken\nE8 , one can rather easily bring the supersymmetry breaking scale and gravitino mass\nclose to the relevant TeV scale [11]. In doing so one stabilizes the hidden boundary close\nto the maximally allowed value Lmax = 1/Gv which is phenomenologically favored as\nit leads to the right value for the 4d Newton's Constant once the Grand Unified gauge\ncoupling and energy scale assume their standard values [21], [10]. Moreover, the hidden\nmatter which arises when we have broken the hidden E8 gauge group down to SU(4)\nor SU(3) (we take for simplicity simple groups though product groups with low dual\nCoxeter number would qualify as well) say, represents a natural candidate for dark matter\nas it couples to the visible matter only (super)gravitationally and can be expected to\nenjoy similar clustering properties required for dark matter to distinguish it from dark\nenergy. Though the complete vacuum energy turns out to be exponentially suppressed\n(similar as in warp-geometries [22]) through the non-perturbative geometrical factors, this\nsuppression is unfortunately not big enough to bring it down to a realistic meV vacuum\n5\n\n\fenergy scale. What one finds instead confirms the general expectation, namely that the\nvacuum energy turns out to be of the same order as the supersymmetry breaking scale,\nthough smaller by a factor of O(10). Therefore, in the supergravity approach to de Sitter\nvacua we still have to live with the cosmological constant problem.\n\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank my collaborators M. Becker, G.
