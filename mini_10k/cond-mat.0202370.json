INTRODUCTION\n\nThe coherent potential approximation (CPA) [1\u20133] as implemented on the basis of\nmultiple scattering theory [4,5] and combined with density functional theory (DFT) [6\u20139]\nconstitutes the basis for ab inito calculations of the electronic structure and physical\nproperties of random metallic alloys. This combination of the CPA with DFT, or, in\nmost cases, with the local density approximation (LDA), seems to be quite transparent\n[8,9] leading to expressions for the one-electron potential and total energy which are\nvery similar to those for ordered systems. However, there is, by now, a well-recognized\nproblem [10\u201313] with this description caused by the fact that the atomic or \"muffin-tin\"\nspheres, which artificially divide the crystal into regions associated with particular alloy\ncomponents, may poses non-zero net charges.\nThe problem stems from the fact that the conventional single-site (SS) DFT-CPA\nmethod is based on the effective medium model of a random alloy which considers only\nconditionally averaged quantities and leads to the use of the single-site approximation\nnot only in the electronic structure part of the problem during the solution of the CPA\nequations, but also in the DFT self-consistent loop in the calculations of the electrostatic\ncontributions to the one-electron potential and energy. The single-site approximation provides no information as to the charge distribution beyond the atomic sphere of each alloy\ncomponent and, since the surrounding effective medium is electroneutral, Poisson's equation cannot be solved properly if the atomic spheres have non-zero net charges. Hence, to\nfind the correct solution to Poisson's equation one must somehow describe the effect of the\nmissing charge. Since the electron density inside each atomic sphere is well-defined, any\nsuch description may be associated with a modification of the effective medium specifically\nfor each alloy component. This may be regarded as an inconsistency since, in that case,\nthe CPA and the electrostatic part of the DFT are based on different effective media.\nOne obvious solution to the problem is to use electroneutral spheres (see, for instance,\nRef. [13]). However, in the methods based on the atomic sphere approximation (ASA)\nthis frequently leads to large sphere overlaps and a quite poor description of the electronic\nstructure, especially in the case of inhomogeneous system, such as partially ordered alloys\nor surfaces with an inhomogeneous concentration profile.\nA more general solution can be found, however, in which the electrostatic potential is\nmodified without making effective media for each alloy component in contradiction to the\nassumptions of the CPA. The way to do this is to introduce an additional shift of the oneelectron potential due to the electrostatic interaction of the electrons inside each atomic\nsphere with the missing charge distributed outside of the sphere and postulate that the\ninteraction comes from the boundary between the atomic sphere and the effective medium.\nSuch a shift may be associated with an intrasite interaction, which has no connection, at\nall, to the effective medium.\nThis is exactly what is done in the locally self-consistent Green's function method [14]\nwhere one goes beyond the single-site approximation for Poisson's equation by means of a\nsupercell which models the spatial distribution of the atoms in a random alloy while a CPA\neffective medium is used in the electronic structure calculations beyond a local interaction\nzone (LIZ). If the LIZ consists of only one atom, the LSGF method becomes equivalent\nto the CPA method with a properly defined electrostatic potential and energy [14]. In\n2\n\n\fthis case, however, each atom in the supercell has its own electrostatic shift given by the\nMadelung potential from all the other atoms in the supercell while the effective medium\nis the same for all atoms. It is clear that such an additional shift for each alloy component\ndoes not interfere with the CPA because the CPA effective medium is determined on the\nbasis of the one-electron potentials including these shifts and because the CPA itself does\nnot impose any restriction on the one-electron potentials of the alloy components.\nFollowing the above arguments two groups have proposed an ad hoc expression for\nthe electrostatic shift of the one-electron potential due to non-zero net charges in the\natomic spheres of the alloy [15,11,12]. Although the basic models are seemingly different\nand based on different observations, either i), the net charge of an impurity in a metal\nis screened beyond the first coordination shell [16,17] or ii), the net charge of an alloy\ncomponent is proportional to the number of the nearest neighbors of the opposite type\n[10], they lead to exactly the same expression for the one-electron potential, i.e.,\nVi = \u2212\n\ne2 qi\n,\nR1\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Vi is the additional electrostatic shift of the one-electron potential of the i-th alloy\ncomponent of net charge qi and R1 the radius of the first coordination shell.\nIn fact, the models described above are practically identical to the model proposed\nmore than three decades ago [18,19] to account for charge transfer effects in the selfconsistent Hartree scheme based on the tight-binding CPA. In this scheme the variation\nof the i-th atom energy level, \u03b4\u01ebi , is proportional to the corresponding charge transfer qi ,\ni.e., \u03b4\u01ebi = Iqi , where I is some average intra-atomic Coulomb interaction. The non-selfconsistent limit corresponds to I = 0, while I = \u221e provides local neutrality [19]. In the\npresent context one may identify \u03b4\u01ebi with Vi and it therefore follows that \u2212e2 /R1 may be\nconsidered an intrasite Coulomb interaction.\nAlthough there is at least some consensus concerning the definition of the additional\nelectrostatic shift (1), which gives charge transfers quite close to the values obtained in\nsupercell calculations [20], different workers do not agree on the corresponding electrostatic contribution to the total energy of the random alloy. Some completely deny even\nthe possibility of having such a term in a \"consistent\" SS-DFT-CPA theory [21,22] while\nothers argue about the details of how this term should be defined [10,12,23,24]. It would\nseem that the presently suggested models of charge transfer effects in the single-site approximation to the electrostatic problem, except the trivial elimination of the net charges\nby adjusting the radii of the atomic spheres of the alloy components, may be considered\nneither exact nor even \"a consistent theory\". It is the main purpose of the present paper\nto shown that a consistent SS-DFT-CPA theory including a correct description of the\ncharge transfer effects does indeed exist.\nHere, we define the electrostatic shift of the one-electron potential and the corresponding contribution to the total energy in a form which is very similar to that proposed by\nKorzhavyi et al. [15,11] as well as Johnson and Pinski [12], and which provides a practically exact solution to the electrostatic problem in the single-site approximation. The\nactual expression for the electrostatic shift in the single-site model for Poisson's equation\nincludes one adjustable parameter the value of which is to be obtained in supercell calculations by the locally self-consistent Green's function method in which the Madelung\n3\n\n\fproblem is solved exactly. It turns out that the value of the adjustable parameter is practically independent of lattice structure, volume, and alloy composition due to the fact\nthat the screening of the electrostatic part of the problem, in the ASA at least, is almost\nuniversal.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we outline the main concepts behind\nthe LSGF used in this work and the details of the calculations. In Sec. III we present a\npragmatic solution to the problem of finding the Madelung shift in SS-DFT calculations\non the basis of the average values of the net charges and Coulomb shifts, < qi > and\n< Vi >, from supercell calculations. We also demonstrate that the linear relation between\nthe net charges, qi , and the corresponding Coulomb shifts, Vi , of the alloy components\ndiscovered for metallic alloys by Faulkner et al. [25] is practically universal in the effective\nmedium approach for the Green's function. This means that the response of the electron\nsystem to the Coulomb field is linear and universal in such systems, and that the screening\nmust be universal too. That this is indeed the case is demonstrated in the next section\nwhere we calculate the distribution of the screening charge in several systems and show\nthat it is almost independent of the crystal structure, the alloy constituents, and the\ncomposition.\nIn Sec. V we present a formalism for the screened Coulomb interactions in the singlesite mean-field approach for the electrostatic potential and energy and demonstrate that\nthe conventional assumption of a vanishing Madelung potential and energy is not valid\nin general. Instead, one must include an additional term due to intrasite interactions\nwhich are, in fact, exactly the screened Coulomb interactions. We also discuss the ordering contribution to the Madelung energy and show why the screening contribution\nmay be obtained in supercell calculations for ordered structures. The contribution from\nthe screened Coulomb interaction to the generalized perturbation method and the S (2)\nformalism is also determined. Finally, in Sec. VI, we demonstrate that the total energy\nof a random alloy may be reproduced exactly in single-site CPA-DFT calculations with\ncorrections due to the screening intrasite interaction.\nII. METHODOLOGY\nA. Spatial ergodicity and cluster expansion\n\nIn this paper we will consider only such alloy systems that on an underlying crystal\nlattice with perfect translational symmetry satisfy two conditions: i) spatial homogeneity\nand ii) no correlations between the one-electron potentials at sufficiently large distances.\nFor the Coulomb interactions in a random alloy both conditions may be formulated explicitly in terms of the average monopole electrostatic potential Vi in the atomic sphere\naround site i due to the charge distribution in the whole of the remaining system. In\nan ordered alloy this potential is the Madelung potential. Specifically, the first condition\nmeans that any average values of products of potentials must be translationally invariant,\ni.e.,\n< Vi Vj . . . Vk >=< Ta (Vi Vj . . . Vk ) >,\nwhere Ta is the translation operator Ta f (r) = f (r + a), and the second condition is\n4\n\n(2)\n\n\f< Vi Vj . . . Vk Ta (Vl Vm . . . Vn ) >=< Vi Vj . . . Vk >< Vl Vm . . . Vn >,\n\n(3)\n\nfor a \u2192 \u221e.\nAccording to Lifshitz et al. [26] the space formed by the complete set of distinct\nrealizations of the potential Vi on the lattice, the operator Ta , and the property of spatial\nhomogeneity plays the same role in the theory of disorder as the phase space, the operator\nof dynamical evolution, and Liouville's theorem do in statistical mechanics. Moreover,\naccording to Birkhoff's ergodic theorem, for any functional f [Vi ], where Vi is some random\nrealization of the potential on the lattice we have\n1Z\nlim\nf [Ta Vi ] =< f [Vi ] >,\nV \u2192\u221e \u03a9 \u03a9\n\n(4)\n\ni.e., the spatial and the phase-space average are equivalent [26]. This equation constitutes\nthe principle of spatial ergodicity, according to which all possible finite atomic arrangements may be realized in a single infinite sample if the conditions (2) and (3) are satisfied.\nWhat makes the above principle work in practice is the fact that for self-averaging or\n\"measurable\" quantities, which have a well-defined limit when the volume of the systems\napproaches infinity, all the correlations of the atomic distribution become unimportant\nat some distances and, hence, the sample may be chosen finite. This may be formulated\nexplicitly by means of the cluster expansion theorem [27] which defines the corresponding\nmeasurable quantity in terms of the site occupation correlation functions\n\u03a0 = \u03c00 +\n\nX\n\n\u03c0f \u03bef ,\n\n(5)\n\nf\n\nwhere \u03c0q are the coefficients or interaction parameters, \u03bef =< \u03b4ci \u03b4j . . . \u03b4ck > the correlation function of the figure or cluster f which corresponds to a specific position of the sites\ni, j, and k in the lattice, and \u03b4ci = ci \u2212 < ci > is the fluctuation of the site occupation\nnumbers ci taking on values 0 and 1 depending on whether site i is occupied by one or\nthe other component.\nAccording to (5) there are two practical ways of calculating the properties of a random\nsystem for which we have \u03bef = 0 and, thus, \u03a0rand = \u03c00 : i) the cluster or supercell\napproach, where \u03bef = 0 is satisfied on average only for those clusters f for which \u03c0f 6= 0,\nor ii) the effective medium approach, which directly gives \u03c00 from some knowledge of the\nalloy components. The first approach is realized, for instance, in the so-called special\nquasirandom structure (SQS) method [28] while the second approach is realized by the\ncoherent potential approximation where the real atoms are substituted by a specifically\nchosen effective medium on the lattice.\nB. The LSGF method: a combined supercell-effective medium approach\n\nThe supercell and the effective medium approaches are combined into a single computational scheme in the locally self-consistent Green's function (LSGF) method [14,29].\nIn the LSGF method the supercell approach is used to provide the correct solution to the\nMadelung problem for a given alloy modeled by an appropriate supercell. It is also used\nin part in the electronic structure calculations, which are performed separately for every\n5\n\n\fatom in the supercell by means of the local interaction zone centered at each atom. Inside\nthe LIZ the multipole scattering equations are solved exactly, while the region outside the\nLIZ is represented by the effective medium, which is usually taken to be the CPA effective\nmedium built on all the one-electron potentials in the supercell. This means that every\natom of the supercell \"sees\" only the CPA effective medium outside the LIZ, which according to the CPA definition represents a random alloy. In other words, the one-electron\nGreen's function of the supercell (sc) obtained in LSGF calculations may be presented as\n[14,29]\nGsc =\n\nX\ni\n\n[G0i +\n\nX\n\nLIZ\n\u2206Gif \u03beif\n],\n\n(6)\n\nf\n\nwhere G0i is the Green' function of the ith atom in the supercell embedded in the CPA\neffective medium, \u2206Gif the contribution to G0i due to the presence of the specific atomic\nLIZ\narrangements on the figure f in the LIZ as specified by the correlation function \u03beif\n,\nsc\nwhich is equal to that of the supercell \u03beif if the figure f is circumscribed by the LIZ,\ni.e., it can be put inside the LIZ in such a way that one of its vertices coincides with the\nLIZ\ncentral atom of the LIZ, otherwise \u03beif\n=0.\nEquation (6) clearly shows how the LSGF works, and in particular, how the effective\nmedium approach, represented by G0i , is combined with the cluster or supercell approach,\nrepresented by by the second term. It follows from (6) that the LIZ allows one effectively\nto cut off the contributions from the clusters which are not circumscribed by the LIZ\n(an equivalent formulation in terms of effective interactions is given in Ref. [29]). If the\nLIZ is single-site, i.e., it consists of only one atom (LIZ=1), the contributions from the\nsecond term in (6) vanish and we are left with the usual CPA or pure effective medium\napproach to the electronic structure problem. It is this single-site approach, referred to\nas SS-LSGF, which will be used in most of the present work. It has the advantage over\nthe usual SS-DFT-CPA method that Poisson's equation is solved exactly within a given\napproximation for the form of the electron density.\nNote, however, that the LSGF method by no means is restricted to the single-site\napproximation. In fact, it allows us to include local environment effects in the electronic\nstructure calculations for the figures circumscribed by the LIZ if on average \u03bef<LIZ> =\n\u03befsc = 0 which is the case in a random alloy. In this respect the LSGF method may be\nconsidered a self-consistent embedded cluster method (ECM) of the kind proposed by\nGonis et al. [30] more than two decades ago. With a proper choice of the supercell used\nto model a given random alloy [29] the LSGF solves two major problems of the ECM: i)\nit provides a set of clusters to represent an alloy with a given short range order and ii) it\nallows one to close the DFT loop with the correct treatment of the electrostatics.\nThere is one important point concerning the electronic structure obtained in the LSGF\nwith the CPA effective medium which should be mentioned: Despite the fact that it can\nbe quantitatively accurate, it is qualitatively different from the electronic structure which\nwould result from direct supercell calculations with periodic boundary conditions. That\nis, the electronic spectrum in the LSGF-CPA method is always complex, unless all the\natoms are equivalent in the supercell (pure metal) or the size of the LIZ is infinite. Thus,\nin the LSGF-CPA the electronic structure of an ordered alloy is never correct, although\nit may be calculated with arbitrarily high accuracy. On the other hand, since Blochs'\n6\n\n\ftheorem is not applied to the supercell during the electronic structure calculations, the\nLSGF method is a perfect tool for calculating SQS as opposed to the ordinary band\nstructure methods, which in this case lead to a real, i.e., qualitatively incorrect, electronic\nstructure of the random alloys due to the fact they present purely a supercell approach.\nC. The choice of the supercell in the LSGF and details of the calculations\n\nIt is possible to obtain the Madelung potential and energy by a combined supercell\n(cluster) and effective medium approach similar to that used in the Green's function\napproach to the electronic structure problem within the LSGF method. However, this\nrequires some knowledge of the charge-charge correlations or the screening in the alloy.\nHence, the only way to solve the problem is to use a supercell model with the Madelung\npotential and energy determined exactly from the bare electrostatic interactions, as it is\nusually done. Here, another problem arises: The supercell should be constructed such as\nto provide zero correlation functions up to the distance where the net charges of the alloy\ncomponents become uncorrelated or completely screened.\nIn the calculations presented below we assume at the outset the existence of a shortrange screening which occurs over the distance of the first several coordination shells.\nThis assumption is based on results obtained by the charge-correlated model [10], on\nsingle-impurity calculations [16,17] as well as on the most recent LSGF calculations by\nUjfalussy et al. [22]. The latter authors demonstrated that a 16-atom supercell for an fcc\nequiatomic random alloy, in which the SRO parameter at the 8'th coordination shell must\nbe equal to 1 due to the translation symmetry, i.e., all the atoms in the 8'th coordination\nshell are the same as that at the central site, yields practically the same average charge\ntransfer and total energy as a 250-atom supercell, in which the SRO parameter at the\n8'th coordination shell corresponding to a random number generator distribution of the\nalloy components on the lattice should be << 1 (see also [31]).\nThus, in all the random alloys considered below the distribution of the atoms in the\n(2)\nsupercell was chosen such that the SRO parameters (or pair correlation functions, \u03bef )\nwere exactly zero at least in the first 6 coordination shells and small (not greater 0.01\nin absolute value) up to the 8th coordination shell. Although the multisite correlation\nfunctions have not been optimized, they should not play a significant role in the ASA\nwhere only monopole intersite Coulomb interactions are taken into account.\nThe electronic structure calculations were in all cases performed in the scalar relativistic approximation by the KKR-ASA technique [32] with an s-, p-, and d\u2212basis in\nthe framework of either the usual SS-DFT-CPA or the LSGF methods with a CPA effective medium. The ASA (no multipole corrections to the Madelung potential and energy)\nhas been used in the electrostatic part of the problem. The integration of the Green's\nfunction over energy was performed in the complex plane over 16-20 energy points on a\nsemicircular contour. The local density approximation was used in the DFT part with\nthe Perdew and Zunger [33] parameterization of the results by Ceperly and Alder [34].\n\n7\n\n\fIII. NET CHARGE AND MADELUNG POTENTIAL IN METALLIC ALLOYS\n\nHere we discuss a pragmatic solution to the following problem: Can one devise a\nMadelung potential for the alloy components to be used in SS-DFT-CPA calculations\nsuch that the charge transfer effects, i.e., the net charges of the alloy components, are\nconsistent with those obtained in SS-LSGF calculations where charge transfer effects are\ntreated properly? The fact, that such a potential can be found, may seem surprising\nin view of the principle difference between the LSGF and the SS-DFT-CPA methods.\nIn the LSGF approach all the atoms in the supercell are different due to their different\nlocal environment while in the usual SS-DFT-CPA approach one deals only with average\nquantities, i.e., in terminology of the Ref. [35], the LSGF supercell approach is equivalent\nto the polymorphous model of the alloy while the effective-medium approach is equivalent\nto the isomorphous model. However, it is obvious, that this can be done on average.\nIt was discovered by Faulkner et al. [25] from supercell calculations that the net charges\non different sites i, qi , and the corresponding Madelung potentials, Vi , obey a linear\nrelationship. In Fig. 1 we show such a qV relation for a 512-atom supercell which models\na random Al50 Li50 alloy on an underlying fcc lattice. For comparison we also show the\ncharge and Madelung shift for AlLi in the ordered L10 structure. All results are obtained\nby LSGF calculations with the CPA effective medium in i) the single-site approximation\nfor the electronic part of the problem, SS-LSGF, i.e., LIZ=1, (upper panel) and ii) with the\nperturbation in the electronic structure caused by the local environment up to the second\ncoordination shell, i.e., embedded cluster(EC)-LSGF, LIZ=3,(lower panel), included in\nthe Green's function. For random alloys the inclusion of more distant coordination shells\ndo not affect the results significantly and thus the LIZ=3 results may be considered to be\nconverged in the LIZ size.\nThe most striking feature of the qV relation obtained in the SS-LSGF calculations\nis the perfect alignment of the qV points along two almost straight lines, one for each\nalloy component. This is, in fact, very similar to what has been observed by Pinski [36]\nin model calculations using the Thomas-Fermi approximation. Furthermore, a change\nof the ratio of the atomic sphere radii of the alloy components, r = SAl /SLi , leads to a\nrescaling of the qV points. Hence, for a specific ratio, r = 1.12 in the present case, the\nqV relation collapses into the single point: (q, V ) = (0, 0). The existence of this point in\nthe SS-LSGF is a consequence of the fact that all Al atoms as well as all Li atoms become\nindistinguishable if the net charges of the alloy components are zero: The difference\nbetween the atoms caused by local environment effects is solely due to the Madelung\nshift, which is zero in this case. Thus, for this particular choice of r the polymorphous\nmodel is identical to the usual isomorphous model, or the SS-LSGF method is identical\nto the SS-DFT-CPA method.\nOn the other hand, it is clear that the two models are not equivalent when local\nenvironment effects are included in the electronic structure part of the LSGF method, i.e,\nfor LIZ>1. This is demonstrated in the lower panel of Fig. 1 where the local environment\neffects are clearly seen to destroy the strict alignment of the qV points and, as consequence,\nthe possibility of choosing electroneutral atomic spheres by a single r value. However, even\nif this were possible, all the atoms, or the corresponding one-electron potentials, would\nstill be different.\n8\n\n\fThe discussion of local environment effects is beyond the scope of the present paper,\nand the results are included only to demonstrate the qualitative difference between the\ncorrect results and those obtained by the LSGF method in the single-site approximation:\nInclusion of intersite correlations in the electronic structure calculations leads to a real\npolymorphous description of random alloys which cannot be mimicked by a single-site\nLIZ. As a consequence, as we will show later the SS-DFT-CPA method can reproduce the\nresults of the SS-LSGF exactly, but will, in general, reproduce only approximately the\ncorrect solution to the supercell or polymorphous model of a random alloy.\nThe two qV points for the ordered L10 structure are seen to fall on the qV lines for\nthe random alloy as already noted in Ref. [25]), and, in fact, all the points on the qV\nrelation obtained by the SS-LSGF method may be reproduced by a series of ordinary\nSS-DFT-CPA calculations, by using the shift of the one-electron potential defined in a\nway similar to (1), i.e.,\ne2 qi\n,\n(7)\nS\nwhere qi is the net charge of the alloy components, S the Wigner-Seitz radius, and \u03b1 a\nparameter which may be varied arbitrarily in the SS-DFT-CPA calculations without specifying its physical meaning. However, it is important to note, that \u03b1 = \u2212\u221e corresponds\nto the electroneutral case (qi = 0) and \u03b1 = 0 to the limit where there is no response of\nthe system to charge transfer effects. As we will see later, the values of the net charges\nq0i obtained in the SS-DFT-CPA calculations with \u03b1 = 0 are important scaling parameters. It is also useful to note, that for the L10 structure \u03b1L10 =0.8811575 [37], and in the\nscreened impurity model (1) \u03b1SIM = 0.552669 and 0.568542 for the fcc and bcc crystal\nstructures, respectively.\nFig. 1 shows the qV relation, indicated by the black line, obtained in the SS-DFTCPA calculations including (7) with \u03b1 varying from \u22121.5 to 5 together with the SS-LSGF\nresults, gray circles. It is clearly seen that the \"isomorphous\" and polymorphous qV\nrelations coincide, and this allows one to make an isomorphous model consistent with the\npolymorphous results. The point is that all the net charges and corresponding Coulomb\nshifts in the polymorphous model have significance only in terms of the average values they\nproduce. This is so, because every supercell has its own set of net charges and Madelung\nshifts and, in the case of an infinite system, there is an infinite number of different qV\npoints. Their average values, < qi > and < Vi >, however, have a well-defined physical\nmeaning as conditional averages of self-averaging quantities, and thus it is the average\n< qV > point which must be reproduced by the isomorphous model. Hence, for a random\nalloy \u03b1 is given by\nVi = \u2212\u03b1\n\n\u03b1rand = \u2212\n\nS < Vi >\n.\ne2 < qi >\n\n(8)\n\nNote, that in a binary AB alloy, it clearly does not matter, for which alloy component,\ni = A, B, \u03b1rand is determined, since < VA > / < qA >=< VB > / < qB > [25]. The same\nis true for multicomponent alloys, but in this case, rather than being a trivial consequence\nof the charge neutrality condition, it follows from the physical origin of \u03b1rand , which will\nbe discussed in the next two sections. For an fcc Al50 Li50 alloy at S=2.954 a.u. we find\nfrom the LSGF calculations \u03b1rand =0.60716.\n9\n\n\fOf course, the coincidence of (< qi >, < Vi >) is a necessary, but not sufficient\ncondition for the equivalence of the isomorphous and polymorphous models. The two\nmodels may be called equivalent only if the electronic structure of the random alloy and\nits conditional averages agree. In Fig. 2 we show that this is indeed the case: The local\ndensities of states (DOS) for the Al and Li atoms in Al50 Li50 calculated by the SS-DFTCPA method coincide with the corresponding conditional average state densities obtained\nin the SS-LSGF calculations for the 512-atom supercell. For comparison we also show the\nDOS obtained with \u03b1 =0 corresponding to the \"conventional\" CPA. Although the latter\ndiffers from the correct state density, it is obvious, that the neglect of the electrostatic\nshift (7) has only a minor effect on the DOS.\nThe reason why the average state densities coincide is the following: In the SS-LSGF\nmethod the difference between the atoms of the same type comes only through the corresponding Madelung shift. A shift in potential leads to a change in the charge transfer\nthrough a skewing of the local DOS as seen in fig. 3. Therefore, when the conditionally\naveraged DOS is obtained, the skewing contributions from the individual atomic sites\ncaused by Vi will cancel and leave only the DOS given by the average < Vi >. Of course,\nthis is true only in the SS-LSGF method (LIZ=1). In fact, the local environment effects\nin concentrated random alloys may influence quite strongly the electronic structure of the\ncentral site of the LIZ.\nTo investigate how the qV relation depends on the system we show in Fig. 4 qV\nrelations for five different systems including a Cu impurity in Pt (S = 3 a.u.) and four\nrandom alloys: fcc Cu50 Pt50 (S = 3 a.u.), fcc Al50 Li50 (S = 2.954 a.u.), bcc Cu50 Zn50\n(S = 2.7 a.u.), and ternary fcc Cu50 Ni25 Zn50 (S = 2.65 a.u.). In the plot all charges have\nbeen normalized by q0i obtained in the no response limit, i.e., \u03b1 = 0 or Vi = 0, and all\nMadelung shifts have been normalized by q0i /S. To partly simplify the plot we have used\n|q0i | in the normalizations, thereby separating the qV relations into two lines rather than\none.\nThe results presented in Fig. 4 show the existence of a universal qV relation. Or\nin other words, the linear-response function \u03c7 which gives the change in the net charge\nrelative to q0i caused by Vi , i.e., qi \u2212 q0i = 1/e2 \u03c7Vi S, is a universal constant in metallic\nalloys in the ASA. From the results presented in the figure we find that \u03c7 \u2248 \u22120.63. This\nunavoidably leads to the existence of a single, unique \u03b1rand as witnessed by the coincidence\nof all the < qV > points in Fig. 4. Strictly speaking, the slopes of the qV lines are not\nexactly identical and, in fact, \u03b1rand varies from 0.6 in Cu50 Zn50 and Cu50 Ni25 Zn50 to\n0.615 in LiMg alloys, not included in the figure. However, for most practical purposes the\nchoice \u03b1rand = 0.607 provides a sufficiently accurate description of the electronic structure\nof random alloys in the SS-DFT-CPA method in the ASA for the electrostatic part.\nIV. SCREENING CHARGE IN METALLIC ALLOYS\n\nIn the previous section we have, in effect, defined a procedure whereby SS-DFT-CPA\ncalculations may provide the exact solution to the electrostatic problem in random alloys.\nThe only requirements are that the Madelung shift (7) is included and that the constant\n\u03b1rand is obtained from (8) with the average Madelung potential and net charges of the\nalloy components determined in supercell calculations by the SS-LSGF method. In the\n10\n\n\fderivation of the procedure we have used some general arguments which do not clarify\nthe physical origin of the universal value of \u03b1rand . However, it is clear, that (7) accounts\nfor the missing charge \u2212qi in the single-site Poisson equation for the i'th atomic sphere.\nThus, \u03b1rand must be connected to the screening.\nThe linear character of the qV relation indicates that the screening in the impurity\ncase as well as in the case of a random alloy may be very well described by linear response\ntheory. Owing to enhanced electron scattering at opposite regions of the Fermi surface\nlinear response predicts in the case of a free-electron gas the existence of long-range Friedel\noscillations, which however decrease relatively fast (\u223c r \u22123 ) with the distance. In a random\nalloy, on the other hand, the screening is much more efficient due to the finite life time\nof the Bloch states for the underlying crystal lattice and the spatial distribution of the\nscreening density decays exponentially. In this respect charge correlated model [10,31]\nadopted by Johnson and Pinski [12] in the cc- and scr-CPA method or the equivalent\nscreened impurity model [11,23,24] may be viewed as the first approximations for the\nscreening.\nBased on the fact, that a single impurity in a metallic host is a particular case of\na dilute random alloy, one would expect, and the results for a single Cu impurity in Pt\npresented in the previous section unambiguously indicate this, that the screening effects in\nthe two cases are similar. It is therefore surprising that Faulkner et al. [35] and Ujfalussy\net al. [22] claim that the screening in a random alloy is qualitatively different from that\nfound in a single impurity system. In fact, these authors found extremely long-range\ncorrelations between the Madelung potential at some particular site and the net charges\nat the other sites. Since the Madelung shift on a site is proportional to the net charge on\nthe site, this may happen only if there are extremely long-ranged correlations between net\ncharges or, in other words, there is no screening. However, this result has been obtained\non the basis of summations of the direct or bare Coulomb interactions which is, at best,\nan ill-defined procedure, even mathematically.\nTo clarify the issue of screening we will perform the following computer experiment\nwhich will allow us to establish the range of the net-charge correlations or the screening\nin random alloys for one particular site. We set up a 512-atom supercell which represents\nan fcc Cu50 Pt50 random alloy (all SRO parameters are equal to zero up to the sixth\ncoordination shell and \u223c 0 for at least the next 10 coordination shells) and perform selfconsistent SS-LSGF (LIZ=1) and EC-LSGF (LIZ=3) calculations. We then substitute\none Pt atom with one Cu atom in some site which, in general, may be chosen arbitrarily.\nHowever, to keep the atomic distribution as close as possible to the random distribution\nwe chose a site the local environment of which corresponds to the random alloy (having\nequal number of Cu and Pt atoms) for the first three coordination shells. We then repeat\nthe self-consistent LSGF calculations for the supercell with the substituted atom and\nfind new values for the net charges in the supercell. It is clear that, when LIZ=1, the\ndifference between the net charges in the two calculations, \u2206qi , gives the charges induced\nby the change of the net charge at the substitution site (in the case of LIZ=3 the local\nenvironment effects also effect the charge transfer). This charge is simply the screening\ncharge.\nIn the upper panel of Fig. 5 we have plotted the normalized, induced charges\n\n11\n\n\fQi =\n\n\u2206qi\n\u2206q0\n\n(9)\n\nat the first eight coordination shells around the substitution site i = 0 for Cu-Pt substitution in a Cu50 Pt50 random alloy and for Cu-Pt substitution in pure Pt (S = 3 a.u.)\nobtained in the single-site approximation for the electronic structure (LIZ=1) as well\nas with local environment effects included (LIZ=3). One may see that, while the local\nenvironment in a pure metal hardly affects the distribution of the net charges, it does\nintroduce a dispersion in the distribution of the net charges in the random alloy, which is\nquite substantial at the first coordination shell but which practically disappears beyond\nthe 5'th coordination shell where, in fact, all the induced charges almost vanish.\nTo demonstrate that the net charge of the Cu \"impurity\" indeed becomes screened we\nshow in the lower panel of Fig. 5 the total normalized induced charge in the i'th shell\nQitot\n\n=\n\ni\nX\n\nzj Qj ,\n\n(10)\n\nj=0\n\nwhere zj is the coordination number of the j'th shell. I is seen that Qi vanishes beyond\nthe 7'th coordination shell in all cases, and we conclude that the screening in a random\nalloy in the single-site approximation is practically the same as the screening in the case of\na single impurity in a pure metal. There is neither qualitative nor quantitative differences\nbetween the impurity and the alloy cases.\nIn the upper panel of Fig. 6 we show the distribution of the screening charge (not to be\nconfused with the screening density: the screening charge is, in fact, the screening density\nintegrated in the corresponding atomic sphere) for a Cu impurity in fcc, bcc, and bct Pt\nplotted as a function of the distance from the impurity site in units of the Wigner-Seits\nradius, S. It is clear that the screening charge follows a single, common curve which does\nnot depend on the structure. In fact, by changing the c/a ratio in the bct structure one\nmay completely fill the remaining gaps in the calculated curve. In the lower panel of the\nfigure we have collected the results for the distribution of the screening charges in seven\ndifferent systems including such hosts as Pt, Al, Cu, V, Na, and K. It appears that the\nscreening in metallic alloys depends neither on the crystal structure nor on the nature of\nthe alloy components, at least, when described within the ASA.\nThe universal picture of the screening in alloy systems found above is partly destroyed\nwhen the electrostatics is treated more correctly, for instance by including multipole\nmoment contributions to the one electron Madelung potential and energy. However, the\nASA still gives a qualitatively correct picture and catches the main physics behind the\nphenomenon. Hence, it is worth to discuss the origin of such a universality in both the\nscreening and the response function.\nFirst of all, it was understood long time ago that the net charges in the atomic spheres\nof the alloy components has very little in common with the \"charger transfer\" in terms\nof the redistribution of the electron charge between the alloy components (see, for instance Ref. [38]). Even in the case of the so-called ionic solids the self-consistent charge\ndistribution is very close to that obtained from a linear superposition of the free-atom\nelectron-densities [39] and this is the reason for the success of the charge-correlated model\n[10], in which the net charge is proportional to the number of nearest neighbors of the\nopposite type (see also Ref. [31]).\n12\n\n\fWhat we are seeing is basically a size effect: The net charges originate from the\nredistribution of the electron density in the interstitial region between the atomic spheres.\nThe electron density in metals and their alloys in this region is very smooth and may be\nwell described by a free-electron model, even for transition metal alloys. The interstitial\ndensity is much easier to perturb than the density closer to the atomic nuclei and it\nparticipates in the screening. On this basis one may, in fact, developed a model based\non linear response theory which leads to a semi-analytical description of the universal\nscreening. However, this is beyond the scope of the present paper.\nThe calculated distribution of the screening net charge may be used to obtain the\nscreening contribution to the one-electron potential in the single-site model for the Poisson\nequation given by (7) with \u03b1 equal to\n\u03b1scr =\n\nS X Qi\nzi ,\ne2 i\nRi\n\n(11)\n\nwhere Ri is the radius of the i'th shell with coordination number zi . Using the results for\nthe screening charge, Qi , in the case of Cu-Pt substitution for one particular site (not on\naverage!) in the Cu50 Pt50 random alloy we find from (11) after summation up to the 8'th\ncoordination shell that \u03b1scr = 0.60572. At the same time, the average values of the net\ncharges and the Madelung potentials, < q > and < V >, in conjunction with (8) gives\n\u03b1rand = 0.60530. That is, \u03b1rand = \u03b1scr . Since, there is only one effective medium in the\nsupercell LSGF calculations, it is obvious that the screening is the same for all the sites\nand, thus, should not depend on the alloy component, that is, the ratio < Vi > / < qi >\ndoes not depend on the alloy components.\nIt is important to understand that \u03b1rand appears in the formalism due to the intrasite\ninteractions between the electron density inside an atomic sphere and its screening (or\nmissing) charge. Therefore the inclusion of (7) in SS-DFT-CPA calculations does not in\nany way contradict the \"conventional\" mean-field picture according to which the contribution from intersite interactions to the Madelung potential is zero in the SS-DFT-CPA.\nIn fact, neglecting the term will lead to incorrect results. On the other hand, the parameter \u03b1L10 which allows one to perform SS-DFT-CPA calculations identical to those of the\nSS-DFT-CPA for the L10 structure, has an origin different from that of \u03b1scr determined\nby (11). The former is a constant, which apart from the L10 symmetry does not depend\non anything, and in particular, not on the screening, while the latter is a system dependent parameter which is entirely determined by the type of intersite interactions or the\nscreening in a given system.\nThis means that there is no connection between the Madelung constants for ordered\nstructures and \u03b1scr . The reason why it is possible to obtain \u03b1scr from the supercell\ncalculations for the completely ordered structures, as we have just done, is the fact that\nat the large distances, where the atomic-distribution correlation-functions are not zero\nanymore, the \"real\" intersite interactions do not contribute to the electrostatics due to\nthe short-ranged screening. We will return to this point in the discussion of the Coulomb\nenergy of a random alloy, but here we would like to comment on the use of the single-site\napproximation in the Green's function calculations.\nOur LSGF calculations of impurities in different metals indicate that the problems\nobserved in the single-site Green's function impurity calculations by Stefanou [17] and\n13\n\n\fDrittler et al. [40] do not originate from the single-site approximation for the Dyson\nequation, but from Poisson's equation, which these authors also solve in the single-site\napproximation. The use of the screening electrostatic shift for the one-electron potential\nallows one to solve the impurity problem in the single-site Green's function formalism in\nthe ASA or in the MT approximation almost exactly. This is so because the impurity case\ncorresponds to the dilute limit of a random alloy where the concentration of one of the\nalloy components approaches zero. In this case, the contribution to the electronic structure\ndue to the local environment effects becomes negligible, and the electronic structure of\nthe impurity obtained by the single-site or the cluster Dyson equations become almost\nidentical. Such an effect may be seen, for instance, in Fig. 5: The dispersion of the\nscreening net charge found in the concentrated alloy case, i.e., Cu50 Pt50 (LIZ=3), vanishes\nin the case of a Cu impurity in Pt. The effect is, in fact, the origin of the increasing\naccuracy of the CPA with decreasing concentration of one of the alloy components.\nV. SCREENED COULOMB INTERACTIONS\nA. The Madelung energy of a random alloy in the single-site mean-field\napproximation\n\nThe formalism describing the electrostatics of random alloys in the single-site meanfield approximation, where all the A and all the B atoms are represented only by the\nappropriate conditional averages, is indeed a trivial one, although it has remained quite\na confusing issue for more than 30 years, starting from the definition of the electrostatic\nenergy of a random alloy given by Harrison in 1966 in connection with pseudopotential\ntheory [41]. According to Harrison the Madelung energy, which may be associated with\nthe electrostatic interactions of the net charges of the ions of a random Ac B1\u2212c alloy, is\ngiven by [41]\nrand\u2212ss\nEM\n=\u2212\nad\n\ne2 \u03b10\ne2 \u03b1M 2\nZ\u0303 ,\nc(1 \u2212 c)(ZA \u2212 ZB )2 +\n2 S\n2 S\n\n(12)\n\nwhere Zi are the ion charges of the alloy components, \u03b1M is the Madelung constant of the\nunderlying lattice, S the radius of the Wigner-Seitz sphere, Z\u0303 the average charge equal\nto cZA + (1 \u2212 c)ZB , and \u03b10 some constant.\nEquation (12) was, in fact, not derived specifically for Coulomb interactions. Rather,\nit was suggested on the basis of a more general consideration of the band-structure contribution to the total energy of a random alloy within second order perturbation theory.\nLater, it was shown by Krasko [42] that in a system with randomly distributed A and B\nions, having charges ZA and ZB , respectively, embedded in a medium of compensating\ncharges, the electrostatic energy included only the second term in (12) while the first term\nvanished.\nIt is obvious that (12) is valid also in the CPA-DFT if one substitutes the ion charges Zi\nby the net charges qi of the atomic spheres. In the ASA the average charge cqA + (1 \u2212 c)qB\nis zero, and in this particular approximation the contribution to the Madelung energy of\na random alloy given by the second term in (12) will also vanish. Note, however, that the\nterm vanishes neither in inhomogeneous systems [24,32] nor in the MT-approximation [9].\n14\n\n\fThis result was criticized by Magri et al. [10] who a decade ago deduced from calculations for ordered compounds that the net charge of the atomic sphere of an alloy\ncomponent is proportional to the number of nearest neighbors of the opposite type, and\non this basis developed the charge correlated model in which the Madelung energy of a\nbinary random alloy is given by\nrand\u2212ss\nEM\n=\u2212\nad\n\ne2 \u03b1cc\nc(1 \u2212 c)(qA \u2212 qB )2 ,\n2 S\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03b1cc is a constant equal to 0.5947049 and 0.60817846 for the fcc and bcc structures,\nrespectively. Exactly the same result has been obtained later by Korzhavyi et al. [15,11]\nand by Johnson and Pinski [12] in their \"screened\" models for the single-site CPA-DFT.\nThe difference between these models lies only in the way the parameter \u03b1cc is determined\n(from 0.4397212 for bcc in Ref. [12] to 0.54282038 for fcc in Ref. [20]). A discussion of\nthe issues involved may be found in Refs. [12,23,24,31,20].\nIt is certainly surprising, that (13) is exactly the first term in (12) which was shown to\nvanish in the case of two charges, here qA and qB , randomly distributed on an underlying\nlattice in a compensating homogeneous effective medium. This means that either the\nmodels are inconsistent with general theory or that there should be some reason, not\naccounted for in the derivation by Krasko, for the presence of the first term in (12).\nAssuming the existence of only on-site and pair-wise interactions the Hamiltonian of\na binary Ac B1\u2212c alloy may be written\nH=\n\nX\n\nB\n[\u01ebA\n0 cR + \u01eb0 (1 \u2212 cR )] +\n\nR\n\n1 X AA\nAB\n[v \u2032 cR cR\u2032 + vRR\n\u2032 (1 \u2212 cR )cR\u2032\n2 R6=R\u2032 RR\n\n(14)\n\nBB\nAB\n+ vRR\n\u2032 cR (1 \u2212 cR\u2032 ) + vRR\u2032 (1 \u2212 cR )(1 \u2212 cR\u2032 )],\n\nwhere \u01ebX\n0 are on-site or intrasite interactions, which we will assume depend only on the\nXY\ntype of atom on site R, vRR\n\u2032 are pair potentials acting between X and Y atoms at site R\n\u2032\nand R , respectively, and cR is the site-occupation operator taking on the value 1 if there\nis an A atom on site R and 0 otherwise. Using \u03b4cR , defined by cR = c + \u03b4cR , we may\nrewrite the Hamiltonian in the equivalent form\nH=\n\n1 X 2 AB\n1 X\n2 BB\nAB\nVRR\u2032 \u03b4cR \u03b4cR\u2032 +\n[c vRR\u2032 + 2c(1 \u2212 c)vRR\n\u2032 + (1 \u2212 c) vRR\u2032 ],\n2 R,R\u2032\n2 R6=R\u2032\n\n(15)\n\nwhere the first term includes the intrasite interaction (R = R\u2032 )\nVR=0 = 2[\n\n1 B\n1\n\u01ebA\n0 + \u01eb0 ]\n(1 \u2212 c)\nc\n\n(16)\n\nas well as the intersite interactions (R 6= R\u2032 )\nAB\nBB\nAA\nVRR\u2032 = vRR\n\u2032 + vRR\u2032 \u2212 2vRR\u2032 .\n\n(17)\n\nUpon Fourier transformation of the first term we find\nN\nH=\n2\u03a9BZ\n\nZ\n\nBZ\n\ndq V (q)cq c\u2217q +\n\n1 X 2 AB\n2 BB\nAB\n[c vRR\u2032 + 2c(1 \u2212 c)vRR\n\u2032 + (1 \u2212 c) vRR\u2032 ],\n2 R6=R\u2032\n15\n\n(18)\n\n\fwhere the second term is the average contribution to the energy due to pair interactions\nwhich in the case of direct Coulomb ion-ion interactions is qx qy /|R\u2212R\u2032 | combined with the\ncorresponding contribution from the interaction between the ions and the homogeneous\ncompensating charge. This is exactly the second term in (12).\nThe first term in (18) is usually associated with the configurational contribution to the\nenergy of the system, but this is correct only if the contribution from intrasite interactions\nis zero. It is easily evaluated in a completely random alloy, where all the occupation numbers are uncorrelated and therefore cq c\u2217q = c(1 \u2212 c)/N (which provides the normalization\nof the ordering energy per atom). One finds\nZ\n\nBZ\n\ndq V (q)cq c\u2217q = c(1 \u2212 c)\n\nZ\n\nBZ\n\ndq V (q) = \u03a9BZ c(1 \u2212 c)VR=0 ,\n\n(19)\n\nB\nwhich according to (14) is equal to c\u01ebA\n0 + (1 \u2212 c)\u01eb0 .\nIt now remains to define the on-site interaction term \u01ebi0 , which results from the interaction of the net charge qi in the alloy with the corresponding screening charge, in\nsuch a way that \u01ebi0 and the corresponding on-site Coulomb potential Vi given by (7) are\nconsistent within DFT, i.e., Vi = \u03b4\u01ebi0 /\u03b4qi :\n\n\u01ebi0 = \u2212\n\ne2 \u03b1scr 2\nq .\n2 S i\n\n(20)\n\nUsing this definition the first term in the Hamiltonian (18) may be written\nrand\u2212ss\nEM\nad\n\n=\n\nscr\u2212ss\nEM\nad\n\ne2 \u03b1scr 2\ne2\n\u03b1scr\n2\n=\u2212\n[cqA + (1 \u2212 c)qB ] = \u2212 c(1 \u2212 c)\n(qA \u2212 qB )2\n2 S\n2\nS\n\u2261 c(1 \u2212 c)Vscr (R = 0),\n\n(21)\n\nwhich is exactly the first term in (12) and which, according to the above derivation, arises\nfrom on-site or intrasite interactions such as the screening interactions in metallic alloys.\nIt is now clear why the first term in (12) is absent in the work by Krasko: His derivation\nis based on inter-site Coulomb interactions only. Thus, Krasko's result is valid in the\nabsence of the screening intrasite interactions, which is the case, for instance, in the\npseudopotential formalism within second order perturbation theory [41]. However, at the\nsame time Harrison's result is in fact correct under the more general assumptions needed\nin the SS-DFT-CPA calculations.\nB. The configurational part of the Madelung energy and potential\n\nThe previous section may seem trivial: First we define our inter- and intrasite interactions in real space, then we Fourier transform, and from the Fourier transform we return\nto the initially defined intrasite term. However, in some formalisms, such as pseudopotential theory or the S (2) formalism [43\u201345], V (q) is already defined and this may lead\nto problems with the correct definition of the configurational part of the total energy.\nThe point is that the intrasite interactions do not contribute to the configurational part\nof the total energy which in real space may be written as (here, we do not consider the\ncontribution from multi-site interactions) [46]\n16\n\n\fHconf =\n\n1 X\nVRR\u2032 \u03b4cR \u03b4cR\u2032 .\n2 R6=R\u2032\n\n(22)\n\nTherefore, if the configurational Hamiltonian is written in terms of V (q), e.g., in the concentration wave formalism, it must be corrected by the subtraction of the corresponding\nintrasite interaction, i.e.,\nHconf\n\nZ\n\n1\n1\n=\ndq V (q)cq c\u2217q \u2212 c(1 \u2212 c)VR=0\n2\u03a9BZ BZ\n2\nZ\n1\ndq [V (q) \u2212 VR=0 ]cq c\u2217q ,\n=\n2\u03a9BZ BZ\n\n(23)\n\nwhere we have used the sum rule for the concentration wave density cq c\u2217q :\n\u2217\nBZ dq V (q)cq cq = \u03a9BZ c(1 \u2212 c).\nThe subtraction of the intrasite term in (23) is crucial for obtaining the correct ordering\nenergy in pseudopotential theory and the S (2) formalism [43\u201345] as well as for making the\nwhole theory consistent. Let us, for instance, consider the Madelung energy of a binary\ncompletely ordered alloy with two non-equivalent sublattices. It is easy to show that its\nMadelung energy can be presented exactly in the form (12). For instance, the Madelung\nenergy of the L10 ordered phase is\n\nR\n\nL10\nEM\nad = \u2212\n\ne2 \u03b1L10\ne2 \u03b1f cc 2\nc(1 \u2212 c)(qA \u2212 qB )2 +\nq\u0303 ,\n2 S\n2 S\n\n(24)\n\nwhere the last term is zero in the ASA since q\u0303=0 as in the random alloy case, but\nnow \u03b1L10 is a constant which appears due to the intersite Coulomb interactions. In the\nAppendix of Ref. [37] it is shown that, in fact, \u03b1L10 (qA \u2212 qB )2 /S is the Fourier transform\nof the effective direct electrostatic interaction at the corresponding superstructure vector\nkL10 = 2\u03c0/a(100), i.e., Ves (kL10 ) = \u03b1L10 (qA \u2212 qB )2 /S.\nL10\nOn the other hand, EM\nad may also be found as the sum of the electrostatic energy\nrand\u2212ss\nof the completely random alloy, EM\n, given by (21) and the ordering energy, \u2206U:\nad\nL10\nL10\nrand\u2212ss\nEM ad = EM ad\n+ \u2206U. Since the Madelung energy of the ordered L10 alloy, EM\nad is\nuniquely defined in terms of the corresponding Madelung constant, which has nothing to\ndo with the screening in the alloy, it is obvious that such a screening term must be present\nin the ordering energy, \u2206U, to compensate the screening contribution.\nIndeed, as shown in the Appendix of Ref. [46] the ordering energy in the L10 structure\ncan be written in the form as\n1\n\u2206UM ad = \u03b7 2 [Ves (kL10 ) \u2212 Vscr (R = 0)],\n8\n\n(25)\n\nfrom which it is easy to see that in the in the completely ordered state, where the long\nrange order parameter \u03b7=1, the last term in (25) is exactly the Madelung energy of\nrand\u2212ss\nrandom alloy at the stoichiometric composition (c(1\u2212c) = 1/4), and thus EM\n+\u2206U =\nad\n2\n1/8\u03b1L10 (qA \u2212 qB ) /S.\nThis illustrates an important point: The ordering energy represented in reciprocal\nspace in the concentration wave formalism must be corrected by the exclusion of the\nintrasite term, otherwise the theory will not be consistent. Equation (23) gives the correct\n17\n\n\fdefinition of the ordering energy considered more thoroughly in the Appendix of Ref. [46].\nThe intrasite interaction must also be subtracted when one considers the energy of SRO\neffects, and thus the correct Krivoglaz-Clapp-Moss expression must have V (q) \u2212 VR=0\ninstead of V (q), which is exactly the case in Krivoglaz's derivation [47]. Note, however,\nthat this problem does not exist if the Krivoglaz-Clapp-Moss expression is used together\nwith the so-called Onsager correction [44] under the condition that it is properly defined.\nThe reason, why it was possible to calculate \u03b1scr on the basis of the ordered structures,\nis the fact that, in an ordered binary alloy with only two non-equivalent sublattices,\none has an exact cancellation of the screening contribution to the Madelung energy and\npotential. This does not happen, however, in the general case of a supercell with n >\n2 non-equivalent sublattices. Here, the Madelung energy may written as sum of the\ncontribution from the intrasite screening interactions\nscr\u2212sc\nEM\n=\nad\n\n[ 6=\n\ne2 \u03b1scr X 2 e2 \u03b1scr 1 X 2\n1 X 2\n[c\nqi =\nqiA + (1 \u2212 c)\nq ]\n2N S i\n2 S NA i=A\nNB i=B iB\n\n(26)\n\ne2 \u03b1scr\n(c < qA >2 +(1 \u2212 c) < qB >2 )],\n2 S\n\nwhere NA and NB are the number of A and B atoms, respectively, and the ordering energy\ndue to the intersite interactions\n\u2206UM ad =\n\ne2 X\n\u03b3i (\u03b1ki \u2212 \u03b1scr )\u2206qk2i .\n2S i\n\n(27)\n\nHere, \u03b3i is a normalizing coefficient, \u03b1ki a constant due to the bare electrostatic interactions\nbetween the net charges for the superstructure vector ki which may be calculated from\nij\nthe Madelung constants \u03b1M\nof the corresponding supercell similar to the \u03b1L10 considered\nabove, and \u2206qki the difference between the charges in the crests and in the troughs of the\nconcentration wave in the supercell. In the case of a binary alloy with two non-equivalent\nsublattices, there is only one ki and \u2206qki = (qA \u2212 qB ).\nIf \u03b1ki depends only on the structure and describe the bare electrostatic interaction\nbetween net charges, then \u2206qki \"dresses\" these interactions according to the real charge\ndistribution in the alloy (an equivalent description in real space in the charge correlated\nmodel is given by Wolverton and Zunger [48], who also show that the Madelung energy of\nthe random alloy has intrasite character). If the net charges in the supercell are screened\n(or uncorrelated) at distances less than half the period of the concentration wave with\nwave-vector ki then \u2206qki =0 and the corresponding contribution to the ordering energy\nvanishes. If the supercell includes only long-range concentration waves, the corresponding\nordering contribution to the Madelung potential and energy becomes zero.\nLet us finally mention the fact that the Madelung energy of a random alloy obtained in\nsupercell calculations (26) is not equal to the Madelung energy in the single-site calculations, and thus it cannot be used to obtain \u03b1scr . The reason is simply that the Madelung\nenergy is not a self-averaging quantity. However, the Madelung potential is, and it is clear\nthat\n< VX >sc =\n\n\u03b1scr\ne2 \u03b1scr X\nqiX = e2\n< qX >= VXss ,\nNX S i=x\nS\n18\n\n(28)\n\n\fwhich allows one to use (8) to obtained \u03b1scr in the supercell calculations and shows why\n\u03b1rand is exactly equal to \u03b1scr .\nC. Intersite screened Coulomb interactions\n\nAlthough the screened Coulomb interactions have an intrasite character, they may\ncontribute to the effective pair intersite interactions of the kind obtained in the generalized\nperturbation method (GPM) [19,49] because the screening charge is located on several\nof the coordination shells around each atom. This was, in fact, already recognized by\nDucastelle [19] who derived the contribution to the GPM potentials from the screened\nCoulomb interactions in the framework of the Hartree-Fock tight-binding CPA theory.\nThe existence of an additional electrostatic term due to the screening is also consistent\nwith Andersen's the force theorem [50], which states that the change in the total energy\nof a system due to some perturbation to first order is given by the change in the sum\nof the one-electron energies obtained from frozen one-electron potentials plus the change\nof the electrostatic energy due to the perturbation. In fact, this latter contribution from\nthe screened Coulomb interaction has been completely neglected in a number of firstprinciples calculations of GPM interactions [51\u201354]. Here, we will therefore show how the\nscreening contribution to the GPM potentials may be defined and obtained on the basis\nof the calculated spatial distribution of the screening charge.\nGPM-like pair interactions, usually defined by (17) for a specific lattice vector R, may\nbe determined as the site-projected part of the change in the total energy when two atoms\nof different types in a completely random alloy are exchanged between sites infinitely far\napart in such a way that their neighbors at the relative position R are of the opposite\ntype after the exchange. This is schematically illustrated in Fig. 7. That part of the total\nenergy which should be accounted for is half the site-decomposed total energy written in\nterms of the intersite interactions or interatomic potentials, i.e.,\n1 (2)\n(2)\nV (2) (R) = [E1 (R) \u2212 E2 (R)].\n2\n(1)\n\n(29)\n\nHere, E1 is the total energy due to pairwise interactions of the unperturbed system pro(2)\njected onto site 0 and E2 is the same quantity after the exchange. A similar expression\nis also valid in the case of multisite interactions, but this will involve a more complex\nexchange of atoms and will not be considered here because the screened Coulomb interactions do not contribute to the effective multisite interactions in the ASA.\nWithin multiple scattering theory as well as in the tight-binding approximation a\nGreen's function formulation allows both site- and \"path\"-decomposition of the electron\ndensity and thereby makes it possible to write down an analytical expression for the oneelectron contribution to the n-site interactions, V (n) (R), in the CPA [19,49]. Concerning\nthe screened Coulomb interactions one must, however, proceed differently. There are\nseveral ways to do so, but here we will present a straightforward approach.\nIn the sense of the CPA and single-site mean-field theory we will use an effective\nmedium approach, assuming that at all sites, i.e., within the atomic spheres assigned to\neach site, there is an electroneutral effective medium except at the two sites 0 and R\nunder consideration. In those two sites we must use the actual values of the net charges\n19\n\n\fof the alloy components, which in the effective medium approach, are the average net\ncharges, qA and qB , of the alloy components.\nIn the first-principles methods, however, these net charges depend on the specific\nchoice of the size of the atomic spheres and thus they must, in principle, go together\nwith the corresponding screening cloud. Since we calculate the change in the electrostatic\nenergy of the two systems shown in Fig. 7 projected onto site 0 due to the exchange of\nA and B atoms in positions R, we must include only the interaction of the net charge at\nsite 0 with the net charge at site R and its screening charge. That is, the interaction of\nthe net charge with its own screening charge must be excluded as it is included in the\ndefinition of the screened on-site interactions, see (11). Thus, the first term in (29) for\nthe system before the exchange of atoms has been made, E1scr (R), is\nE1scr (R) = e2 qA\n\nX\n\nX qBR\u2032\nqAR\u2032\n2\n+\ne\nq\n.\nB\nR\u2032\nR\u2032\nR\u2032 6=0\nR\u2032 6=0\n\n(30)\n\nHere, qiR\u2032 is either the net charge of the ith component, qi , if R\u2032 = R or the corresponding\nscreening charge if R\u2032 6= R. A similar expression may be written for E2scr (R), after the\nexchange of the A and B atoms in the R-sites, i.e.,\nE2scr (R) = e2 qA\n\nX qAR\u2032\nqBR\u2032\n2\n+\ne\nq\n.\nB\n\u2032\n\u2032\nR\u2032 6=0 R\nR\u2032 6=0 R\nX\n\n(31)\n\nThe resulting expression for the screened Coulomb interactions which should be added to\nthe usual one-electron term is therefore\nVscr (R) =\n=\n\nX qAR\u2032 \u2212 qBR\u2032\nX qBR\u2032 \u2212 qAR\u2032\ne2\n[qA\n\u2212 qB\n]\n\u2032\n2\nR\nR\u2032\nR\u2032 6=0\nR\u2032 6=0\n\n(32)\n\nX Q(|R\u2032 \u2212 R|)\ne2\n(qA \u2212 qB )2\n,\n2\nR\u2032\nR\u2032 6=0\n\nwhere Q(R) is the normalized screening charge defined in (9), and where we have used the\ncondition that the screening does not depend on the type of the atom. Finally, performing\nthe summation in (32) one may define the screened Coulomb interactions as\nVscr (R) =\n\ne2\n\u03b1scr (R)\n(qA \u2212 qB )2\n.\n2\nS\n\n(33)\n\nIt is easy to see from (32) and (11) that \u03b1scr (R = 0) = \u03b1scr = \u03b1rand and therefore,\nVscr (R = 0) is exactly the on-site screened interactions that defines the Madelung energy\nof the binary alloy which has exactly the same form (21). This on-site interaction must\nbe included in the definition of the S (2) interactions [43], as has been demonstrated in\nthe previous section (see also Ref. [45]). When R 6= 0, Vscr (R) defines the intersite\nscreened Coulomb interaction contribution to the GPM-like effective interactions. Since\nthe screening in the ASA, is practically universal these interactions have the universal\nform presented in Fig. 8.\n\n20\n\n\fVI. THE TOTAL ENERGY IN THE SINGLE-SITE CPA AND THE\nSUPERCELL LSGF METHODS\n\nThe fact that the Madelung energy of a random alloy described either by the effective medium model defined by the SS-DFT-CPA method or by the supercell model in\nconjunction with the SS-LSGF method differ from each other, has neither consequences\nfor the final result for the total energy of the random alloy nor even for the partial and\nlocal contributions to the total energy. This follows simply from the fact that the density\nof states and its average local contributions are the same in the two methods, as shown\nabove.\nIn Table I we compare the total energy and its components in a Cu50 Pt50 random\nalloy calculated by the SS-DFT-CPA method with \u03b1scr =0.60572 and by the SS-LSGF\nmethod on the basis of a 512-atom supercell, in which the atomic positions of Cu and Pt\nhave been chosen such that the SRO parameters are equal zero at the first 7 coordinations\nshells (LSGF-1). The agreement between the two calculations is seen to be excellent if\none combines the electron-nucleus, the electron-electron, and the Madelung contributions\nto form a total Coulomb energy, Ecoul = Eel\u2212nuc + Eel\u2212el + EM ad .\nThe accuracy of the SS-DFT-CPA method with the appropriate screening contribution to the Madelung potential and energy may be appreciated if one compares the results\nof a 512-atom supercell calculation performed by the SS-LSGF method (LSGF-2) where\nthe distribution of the Cu and Pt atoms have not been optimized after the application\nof the random number generator leading to quite small, but not zero, SRO parameters.\nThe values of the SRO parameters for the first 7 coordination shells are \u22120.005208 (1),\n0.026041 (2), 0.007161(3), -0.014323(4), -0.021484(5), 0.0390625(6), \u22120.0136718 (7), respectively, which are approximately the same, as in the LSMS calculations in Ref. [55].\nThe agreement between SS-DFT-CPA results and SS-LSGF calculations with a properly\nchosen supercell (LSGF-1) is obviously better than between two SS-LSGF calculations.\nVII. CONCLUSION\n\nThe screened Coulomb interactions which are due to the interaction between the net\ncharge of an alloy component and its screening charge must be included in a consistent\nsingle-site mean-field theory of the electrostatics in random alloys. In this paper we\nhave shown how this may be done and we have calculated the spatial distribution of the\nscreening charge which in the ASA is found to be practically universal for homogeneous\nsystems.
