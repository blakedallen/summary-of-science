We find that, in the Eulerian case, the persistence-time PDFs have exponential tails;\nby contrast, this PDF for Lagrangian particles, in vortical regions, has a power-law tail with an\nexponent \u03b8 = 2.9 \u00b1 0.2.\nPACS numbers: 47.27.-i,05.40.-a\nKeywords: turbulence, statistical mechanics, persistence\n\nThe persistence problem, which is of central importance in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics [1],\nis defined as follows: For a fluctuating field \u03c6, the\npersistence-time probability distribution function (PDF)\nP \u03c6 (\u03c4 ) yields the probability that the sign of \u03c6 at a point\nin space does not change up to a time \u03c4 . Theoretical,\nexperimental, and numerical studies of a variety of systems, ranging from reaction-diffusion systems to granular\nmedia, have shown that P \u03c6 (\u03c4 ) \u223c \u03c4 \u2212\u03b8 as \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e, where\n\u03b8 is the persistence exponent. This nontrivial exponent\ncannot be obtained from dimensional arguments; it can\nbe calculated analytically only for a few models [2]; for\nmost models it has to be obtained numerically. We propose a natural way of defining the persistence problem\nin two-dimensional turbulence. We then show how to\nobtain the persistence exponent for this case.\nTurbulent flows in two-dimensional fluid films display vortical points and strain-dominated or extensional\npoints. We show how to examine the persistence of such\npoints in time by direct numerical simulations (DNSs)\nof the forced, two-dimensional, incompressible Navier\u2013\nStokes equation. Our study has been designed with thinfluid-film experiments in mind [3, 4] so we account for an\nair-drag-induced Ekman friction and we drive the fluid\nby using a Kolmogorov forcing. We demonstrate that the\nOkubo-Weiss parameter [5, 6] \u039b, whose sign at a given\npoint determines whether the flow there is vortical or\nextensional, provides us with a natural way of studying\nsuch persistence.\nIt is important to distinguish the following types of\npersistence times: (A) In the Eulerian framework we consider a point (x, y) and, by following the time evolution of\n\u039b, determine the time \u03c4 for which the flow at this point\nremains vortical (extensional) if the flow at this point\nbecame vortical (extensional) at some earlier time; (B)\n\nin the Lagrangian framework we consider how long a Lagrangian particle resides in a vortical (extensional) region\nif this particle entered that vortical (extensional) region\nat an earlier time. For all these cases we obtain PDFs of\nthe persistence or residence times that we denote generically by \u03c4 . We find, in the Eulerian framework, that\nthe PDFs of \u03c4 show exponential tails in both vortical\nand extensional regions. In the Lagrangian framework\nthe PDF of the residence time of the particle in extensional regions also shows an exponential tail; the analogous PDF for vortical regions shows a power-law tail.\nThe persistence exponent that characterizes this power\nlaw is independent of parameters such as the Reynolds\nnumber, the characteristic scale of the forcing, and the\ncoefficient of Ekman friction, at least at the level of our\nnumerical studies.\nWe perform a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the\nincompressible, two-dimensional, Navier-Stokes equation\n\u2202t \u03c9 \u2212 J(\u03c8, \u03c9) = \u03bd\u22072 \u03c9 + f\u03c9 \u2212 \u03bc\u03c9,\n\n(1)\n\nwith periodic boundary conditions, by using a pseudospectral method [7] with N 2 collocation points and the\n2/3 dealiasing rule. Here \u03c8 is the stream function, \u03c9 the\nvorticity, J(\u03c8, \u03c9) \u2261 (\u2202x \u03c8)(\u2202y \u03c9)\u2212(\u2202x \u03c9)(\u2202y \u03c8), \u03bd the kinematic viscosity, and \u03bc the coefficient of Ekman friction.\nAt the point (x,y) the velocity u \u2261 (\u2212\u2202y \u03c8, \u2202x \u03c8) and\nthe vorticity \u03c9 = \u22072 \u03c8; the external deterministic force\nf\u03c9 (x, y) = \u2212F0 kinj cos(kinj x), where F0 is an amplitude\nand kinj the energy-injection scale in Fourier space. The\ninjected energy displays an inverse cascade to small k.\nEkman friction removes energy from all Fourier modes; in\nparticular, it removes energy from small-k Fourier modes\nin such a way that the system reaches a nonequilibrium\nstatistically steady state. We evolve Eq. 1 in time by a\nsecond-order, exponential Runge-Kutta method [8]. In\n\n\f2\nall our simulations we wait for a time Ttran [see the caption of Table (I)] to allow transients to die out so that\nour system reaches a statistically steady state. Figure (1)\nshows a typical pseudocolor plot of \u03c8 in such a state.\nTo calculate Lagrangian quantities we track Np particles. The evolution equation for a Lagrangian particle is\nd\ndt xL (t) = u(xL , t), where xL (t) is the position of a Lagrangian particle at time t; u(xL , t), the velocity at the\nLagrangian particle position, is evaluated from the Eulerian velocity field u(x, t) by using a bilinear-interpolation\nscheme [9]. The evolution equation of the particles is\nsolved by a second-order, Runge-Kutta method [9]. Initially all the particles are seeded randomly into the flow.\nA typical Lagrangian-particle track superimposed on a\nrepresentative pseudocolor plot of \u03c8 is shown in Fig. (1).\nThe list of parameters used in our simulations is given in\nTable (I).\nFrom the velocity-gradient tensor A, with components\nAij \u2261 \u2202i uj , we obtain the Okubo-Weiss parameter \u039b,\nthe discriminant of the characteristic equation for A. If\n\u039b is positive (negative) then the flow is vortical (extensional) [5]. In an incompressible flow in two dimensions\n\u039b = detA; and the PDF of \u039b has been shown [4] to\nbe asymmetrical about \u039b = 0 (vortical regions are more\nlikely to occur than strain-dominated ones). For the Eulerian case, we monitor the time evolution of \u039b at Np\nrandomly chosen points that are fixed in the simulation\ndomain. In our Lagrangian study, we begin with the values of \u039b on the spatial grid that we use for our Eulerian\nDNS; bilinear interpolation then yields \u039b at the positions\nof Lagrangian particles, which can be at points that do\nnot lie on this grid; we can thus monitor the evolution of\n\u039b along Lagrangian-particle trajectories.\nWe denote the presistence-time PDFs by P and the associated cumulative PDFs by Q; the subscripts E and L\non these PDFs signify Eulerian and Lagrangian frames,\nrespectively; and the superscripts + or \u2212 distinguish\nPDFs from vortical points from those from extensional\nones. To find out the persistence-time PDF PE+ (\u03c4 ) [resp.,\nPE\u2212 (\u03c4 )] we analyse the time-series of \u039b obtained from\neach of the Np Eulerian points and construct the PDF of\nthe time-intervals \u03c4 over which \u039b remains positive (resp.,\nnegative). The same method applied to the time series\nof \u039b, obtained from each of the Np Lagrangian particles,\nyields PL+ (\u03c4 ) [resp., PL\u2212 (\u03c4 )].\nWe use the rank-order method [10] to calculate cumulative PDFs because they are free from binning errors. We show representative plots of the cumulative\n\u2212\n\u2212\nPDFs Q+\nE (red crosses), QE (black open circles), and QL\n(magenta full circles) in Fig. (2a); the dashed lines indicate exponential fits to these cumulative PDFs. From\nthese and similar fits we conclude that the PDFs PE+ ,\nPE\u2212 , and PL\u2212 have exponentially decaying tails, for all\nthe runs, from which we can extract characteristic time\nscales. In particular, from the Eulerian PDFs we obtain the times TE+ and TE\u2212 , for vortical and strain-\n\ndominated regions, respectively, which are defined as follows: PE+ (\u03c4 ) \u223c exp(\u2212\u03c4 /TE+ ) and PE\u2212 (\u03c4 ) \u223c exp(\u2212\u03c4 /TE\u2212 )\nas \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e [see Table (I)]. The Lagrangian PDF PL\u2212 also\nhas an exponentially decaying tails from which we obtain\nthe characteristic time TL\u2212 [see Table (I)].\nThe persistence-time PDF PL+ and the associated cumulative PDF Q+\nL of a Lagrangian particle in a vortical\nregion is very different from those discussed above: the\ntails of PL+ and Q+\nL have power-law, and not exponential,\nforms; we show this in Fig. (2b) via a representative plot\nQ+\nL for the run R4. Thus, as in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics [1], we can define the persistence exponent\n\u03b8 via PL+ \u223c \u03c4 \u2212\u03b8 . Our run R4 has the largest value of\nRe\u03bb amongst the runs R1 \u2212 4 [Table (I)] and, therefore,\nis best suited for estimating \u03b8 from plots such as the one\nin Fig. (2b). We obtain the exponent (\u2212\u03b8 + 1) by fitting\na power-law to the tail of the cumulative PDF Q+\nL . To\nfind the best estimate for (\u2212\u03b8 + 1) we evaluate the local\nslope \u03c7 = d log10 Q+\nL (\u03c4 )/d log10 (\u03c4 ) in the region shown\nin the inset of Fig. (2b). Our estimate for (\u2212\u03b8 + 1) is the\nmean value of \u03c7 over the region indicated in the inset; the\nstandard deviation of \u03c7 yields the error; finally we obtain\n\u03b8 = 2.9 \u00b1 0.2. Our other runs R1 \u2212 3 yield smaller scaling ranges than the one in Fig. (2b) and, therefore, yield\nvalues for \u03b8 with larger error bars; but these values are\nconsistent with our estimate for \u03b8 from run R4. We also\nfind that the persistence exponent \u03b8 does not depend on\nthe parameters \u03bc, F0 , and kinj (within error-bars) in the\nrange of parameters accessible in our simulations. Based\non this evidence we conjecture that \u03b8 is a new universal exponent that characterizes two-dimensional, Navier\u2013\nStokes turbulence. A conclusive proof of this conjecture\nmust await future studies.\nThe exponent \u03b8 > 1, so we can obtain the average life+\ntime Tmean\nof a particle in a vortical region from PL+ ;\nAnother estimate of the lifetime of vortices in the Lagrangian frame is given by the time scale Tcf , which is\nthe cutoff scale of the power-law decay of tail of PL+ ,\n[Table (I)].\nIn most persistence problems in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics the power-law tail for the presistencetime PDF appears in the following way: Typically we\nconsider the persistence-time PDF of \u03c6 that comes from\na Gaussian, but non-stationary, process; a transformation to logarithmic time s transforms such a process to a\nGaussian stationary process (GSP) X(s); if, in addition,\nthe GSP is also Markovian, i.e., the autocorrelation function of the GSP, f (t) = hX(s)X(s+t)is , is an exponential\nfunction of t, then the presistence-time PDF of the GSP\ncan be shown to have an exponential tail [1]. If we now\ntransform back from logarithmic to linear time, the exponential tail is transformed to a power-law tail. Furthermore, for a GSP for which the autocorrelation function\nf (t) decays faster than 1/t for large t, the persistencetime PDF P (t) \u223c exp(\u2212\u03b3t), where \u03b3 is a constant [1].\nIn the two-dimensional, fluid-turbulence problem that\n\n\f3\nwe study here, we have checked numerically that \u039b is a\nstationary process; hence we do not need to transform\nto logarithmic time. We have calculated two types of\nautocorrelation functions for \u039b (we denote these generically by C\u039b (t) in Fig. (2c)): (a) For the first we evaluate\nh\u039b(0)\u039b(t)i over the track of a Lagrangian particle; this is\nshown by blue open circles in Fig. (2c); (b) for the second\nwe evaluate h\u039b(0)\u039b(t)i at a given point on our Eulerian\ngrid; this is shown by red full circles in Fig. (2c); here h*i\ndenotes averages over different origins of time and also\nover Np different Lagrangian particles, for case (a), or\nover Np different Eulerian positions, for case (b). As we\nshow in the inset of Fig. (2c) for both these cases, C\u039b (t)\nis approximated well by the function exp[\u2212(t/T\u039b )2 ], over\nthe range 10\u22124 < (t/T\u03b7 ) < 10\u22121 ; this decay is clearly\nfaster than 1/t for large t. Here T\u039b , the characteristic decay time, is slightly larger in the Lagrangian case than in\nthe Eulerian one; however, in both these cases T\u039b ' T\u03b7 .\nPlots of C\u039b from our other runs R1 \u2212 3 are similar to the\none in Fig. (2c) from run R4. Note that, in the problem\nwe study, the persistence-time PDF is not constrained to\nhave an exponential tail because \u039b, although stationary,\nis not a Gaussian process.\nWe have presented a natural framework for studying\nthe persistence problem in two-dimensional fluid turbulence. The most important result of our study is that the\npersistence-time PDFs for vortical points show qualitatively different behaviors in the Eulerian and Lagrangian\ncases: In vortical regions, for the Eulerian case, this PDF\ndisplays an exponential decay; in contrast, for the Lagrangian case it shows a power-law tail. Qualitatively\nsuch nontrivial behavior appears because a passive particle can be trapped for quite some time in a vortical\nregion [11]) Furthermore, we provide a way of measuring the lifetime of a vortex precisely. In the Eulerian\nframe the characteristic lifetime of a vortex is the time\nscale TE+ that follows from the exponential form PE+ (\u03c4 ) \u223c\nexp(\u2212\u03c4 /TE+ ). However, in the Lagrangian frame the\npersistence-time PDF for vortical points shows a powerlaw decay with a persistence-time exponent \u03b8 = 2.9\u00b10.2.\nHence there is no single time scale which describes the\ntime spent by passive particles in vortical points; but, as\nwe have mentioned above, an average residence time can\nbe defined because \u03b8 > 1.\nThe PDF of residence times of passive tracers in vortical regions PL+ is of great fundamental and engineering\nimportance. Earlier studies [12, 13] have attempted to\nmeasure this PDF; however, their methods of obtaining it\nare not as precise as the one we present here: the OkuboWeiss parameter \u039b, which we employ, helps us to distinguish clearly between vortical and extensional regions\nin the two-dimensional flows we consider. The natural\nway of generalizing our study to its three-dimensional\ncounterpart is to replace the Okubo-Weiss parameter by\nQR plots [14] and then to study the PDFs of residence\ntimes of Lagrangian particles in each quadrant of the QR\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) (a) A pseudocolor plot of the stream\nfunction \u03c8, at a representative time in the statistically steady\nstate, with a representative Lagrangian particle track (blue\nsquares) superimposed on it from our run R2.

It remains to be seen\nwhether the tails of such PDFs have power-law tails in\nthree-dimensional turbulence; such a study lies beyond\nthe scope of this paper. From the point of view of the\ngeneral theory of persistence problems, the time-series of\n\u039b in the Lagrangian frame provides a particularly interesting example. The persistence-time PDF has a powerlaw behavior for positive \u039b but an exponential tail for\nnegative \u039b. A similar, but less dramatic, example of\nsuch asymmetry has been observed for the case of growing interfaces whose height h obeys the Kardar-ParisiZhang (KPZ) equation [15]. For this KPZ case, the\npersistence-time PDF shows power-law tails, but with\ndifferent persistence-time exponents for positive and negative h. We hope our study will stimulate new experimental investigations of persistence-time PDFs in twodimensional fluid turbulence and also studies of such\nPDFs for other non-Gaussian, stationary processes.\nWe thank S.
