Important questions in this respect are: Under\nwhat circumstances does the blow up occur? What is the mechanism that leads to singularity formation?\nWhat is the blow up rate and the shape of the profile before the singularity forms? Unfortunately, many\ninteresting examples from physics (such as Einstein's equations) are much too complicated to be accessible\nto presently available analytical techniques. Thus, one has to rely on numerical studies and simplified\n\"toy models\" which share some features with the original equation but are easier to handle.\nThe wave maps system provides an example of such a toy model which has been studied in recent\ntimes. Consider (n + 1)\u2013dimensional Minkowski space (Rn+1 , \u03b7) with metric (\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd ) = diag(\u22121, 1, . . . , 1),\nan m\u2013dimensional Riemannian manifold (M, g) with metric g and a mapping \u03a6 : Rn+1 \u2192 M . Choosing\nlocal coordinates on M we denote the components of \u03a6 and the metric g by \u03a6A and gAB , respectively,\nwhere capital latin indices run from 1 to m. The action functional S for wave maps is defined by\nZ\nS(\u03a6) =\n\u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd (\u2202\u03bc \u03a6A )(\u2202\u03bd \u03a6B )gAB \u25e6 \u03a6\nRn+1\n\nwhere integration is understood with respect to the ordinary Lebesgue measure on Rn+1 and Einstein's\nsummation convention is in force (greek indices run from 0 to n). As usual we write \u2202\u03bc := \u2202x\u2202\u03bc . The\nEuler\u2013Lagrange equations associated to this action are given by\n\u0003\u03a6A + \u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd \u0393A BC (\u03a6)(\u2202\u03bc \u03a6B )(\u2202\u03bd \u03a6C ) = 0\nA\n\n1 AD\ng (\u2202B gCD + \u2202C gBD \u2212 \u2202D gBC ) are the Christoffel symbols associated\n2\n\u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bd denotes the wave operator. Eq. (1) is known as the wave maps\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u0393 BC :=\nto the metric g\non M and \u0003 :=\nequation and it\nis a system of semilinear wave equations.\nWe are interested in the Cauchy problem for eq. (1), i.e. we prescribe initial data \u03a6A |t=0 = \u03a6A\n0 and\n\u2202t \u03a6A |t=0 = \u03a6A\n1 where \u2202t := \u22020 and study the future development.

Moreover, the time T can be chosen to depend continuously on\nA\nA\nA\ns\ns\u22121\nthe initial data and the mapping (\u03a6A\n\u2192 C([0, T ], H s ) \u00d7 C([0, T ], H s\u22121 )\n0 , \u03a61 ) 7\u2192 (\u03a6 , \u2202t \u03a6 ) : H \u00d7 H\nis continuous (see [6] and references therein for details). There are also many recent results addressing\nglobal issues, see e.g. [16] for a review. Of most interest for our purposes is Tao's work [15] which deals\nwith spherical targets, i.e. M is an (m \u2212 1)\u2013sphere for m, n \u2265 2. Under this assumption a global smooth\nsolution of the wave maps system eq. (1) exists whenever the initial data are smooth and small in the\nhomogeneous Sobolev space \u1e22 n/2 \u00d7 \u1e22 n/2\u22121 .\nThe present work deals with co\u2013rotational wave maps from (3 + 1)\u2013Minkowski space to the three\u2013\nsphere S 3 . Choosing the usual spherical coordinates (t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) on Minkowski space and standard coordinates (\u03c8, \u0398, \u03c6) on S 3 with metric g = d\u03c8 2 + sin2 \u03c8(d\u03982 + sin2 \u0398d\u03c62 ), we restrict ourselves to mappings of\nthe form (t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) 7\u2192 (\u03c8(t, r), \u03b8, \u03c6) which are called co\u2013rotational. Under these assumptions the system\neq. (1) reduces to the single semilinear wave equation\n\n\u03c8tt \u2212 \u03c8rr \u2212\n\n2\nsin(2\u03c8)\n\u03c8r +\n= 0.\nr\nr2\n\n(2)\n\nWe remark that Tao's result applies to this problem but there are earlier papers by Sideris [13] and\nShatah, Tahvildar\u2013Zadeh [12] which address global questions for this particular model.\n\n2\n\nSelf\u2013Similar Solutions and Singularity Formation\n\nNote that eq. (2) is invariant under dilations, i.e. if \u03c8 is a solution, so is \u03c8\u03bb defined by \u03c8\u03bb (t, r) :=\n\u03c8(t/\u03bb, r/\u03bb) for a \u03bb > 0. There exists a conserved energy associated to eq. (2) given by\nZ \u221e\n` 2 2\n \u0301\nE\u03c8 (t) =\nr \u03c8t (t, r) + r 2 \u03c8r2 (t, r) + 2 sin2 (\u03c8(t, r)) dr\n0\n\nthat scales as E\u03c8\u03bb = \u03bbE\u03c8 which means that eq. (2) is energy supercritical. It is widely believed that\nfor energy supercritical equations blow up is possible since it is energetically favourable for solutions to\nshrink which might result in the formation of a singularity. In order to obtain an explicit example of\na blow up solution it is reasonable to look for self\u2013similar solutions \u03c8(t, r) = f ( T r\u2212t ) where T > 0 is a\nparameter (the blow up time). Plugging this ansatz into eq. (2) yields\nf \u2032\u2032 +\n\nsin(2f )\n2 \u2032\nf \u2212 2\n=0\nr\n\u03c1 (1 \u2212 \u03c12 )\n\n(3)\n\nd\nwhere \u2032 := d\u03c1\nand \u03c1 := T r\u2212t . We require the regularity conditions f (0) = 0 and f (1) = \u03c02 . Shatah [11]\nhas shown existence of a smooth solution f0 of eq. (3) which has later been found in closed form [17] and\nit is given by f0 (\u03c1) = 2 arctan(\u03c1). Bizo\u0144 [2] has extended this result by proving existence of a countable\nfamily {fn : n = 0, 1, . . . } of analytic solutions of eq. (3) satisfying fn (0) = 0 and fn (1) = \u03c02 where n\ncounts the number of intersections of fn with the line \u03c02 on the interval [0, 1). Furthermore, the solutions\nfn converge to the constant f\u221e \u2261 \u03c02 for n \u2192 \u221e pointwise on (0, 1]. These self\u2013similar wave maps provide\nexplicit examples of solutions with smooth finite energy initial data (use appropriate cut\u2013off functions\nand finite speed of propagation) that become singular when t \u2192 T \u2212.\nAn obviously important question is whether blow up occurs for generic initial data or the self\u2013similar\nexamples are \"exceptional cases\". This issue has been addressed by Bizo\u0144 et. al. [4] using numerical\ntechniques. Their results strongly suggest that the self\u2013similar solution f0 provides a universal blow up\nprofile. More precise, they conjecture that there exists a large set of initial data that lead to blow up\nand the singularity formation takes place via f0 , i.e. the time evolution approaches f0 near the center\nr = 0 as t \u2192 T \u2212.\nWe remark that this self\u2013similar blow up behaviour is very different from singularity formation in\nthe energy critical case of co\u2013rotational wave maps from (2+1)\u2013Minkowski space to the two\u2013sphere.\nFor this model it has been known for quite some time (see [14]) that the blow up rate cannot be self\u2013\nsimilar. However, rigorous existence of blow up solutions has only recently been shown by Rodnianski\nand Sterbenz [10] as well as Krieger, Schlag, Tataru [7].\n\n2\n\n\f3\n\nThe Linear Stability Problem\n\nAs mentioned, the self\u2013similar solution f0 seems to play an important role in dynamical time evolution.\nThus, it has to be stable in a certain sense since otherwise it could not be found by numerical time\nevolutions starting from generic initial data. In order to study\nlinear stability of the wave map fn we\np\nintroduce adapted coordinates (\u03c3, \u03c1) given by \u03c3 = \u2212 log (T \u2212 t)2 \u2212 r 2 and \u03c1 = T r\u2212t (cf. [2]). The\nintroduction of similarity coordinates in the study of self\u2013similar blow up is very common (see e.g. [8]).\nWe refer to (\u03c3, \u03c1) as hyperbolic coordinates since the lines \u03c3 = const are hyperbolae in a spacetime\ndiagram. Note that the coordinate system (\u03c3, \u03c1) is only defined for r < T \u2212 t and thus, it covers the\ninterior of the backward lightcone of the blow up point (t, r) = (T, 0). Furthermore, (\u03c3, \u03c1) is an orthogonal\ncoordinate system, i.e. the vectorfields \u2202\u03c3 and \u2202\u03c1 are orthogonal with respect to the Minkowski metric.\nMoreover, the blow up time t = T is shifted to infinity, i.e. t \u2192 T \u2212 corresponds to \u03c3 \u2192 \u221e. The valid\nrange is \u03c3 \u2208 R and \u03c1 \u2208 [0, 1). Eq. (2) transforms into\n\u03c8\u03c3\u03c3 \u2212 2\u03c8\u03c3 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03c12 )2 \u03c8\u03c1\u03c1 \u2212\n\n2(1 \u2212 \u03c12 )2\n(1 \u2212 \u03c12 ) sin(2\u03c8)\n\u03c8\u03c1 +\n= 0.\n\u03c1\n\u03c12\n\n(4)\n\nPlugging the ansatz \u03c8(\u03c3, \u03c1) = fn (\u03c1) + \u03c6(\u03c3, \u03c1) into eq. (4) and linearizing around fn we arrive at the\nevolution equation\n\u03c6\u03c3\u03c3 \u2212 2\u03c6\u03c3 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03c12 )2 \u03c6\u03c1\u03c1 \u2212\n\n2(1 \u2212 \u03c12 ) cos(2fn )\n2(1 \u2212 \u03c12 )2\n\u03c6\u03c1 +\n\u03c6=0\n\u03c1\n\u03c12\n\n(5)\n\nfor the perturbation \u03c6 which governs the linearized flow around the wave map fn . The wave map fn\nis considered to be linearly stable if there do not exist solutions of eq. (5) that grow (with respect to\na suitable norm) as \u03c3 increases. We will make\np this \u2032more precise below. However, a direct computation\nG\n\u03c3\nshows that \u03c6G\n1 \u2212 \u03c12 fn (\u03c1) solves eq. (5). This instability is related to the\nn defined by \u03c6n (\u03c3, \u03c1) := e \u03c1\ntime translation symmetry of the original problem. The reason for this is the fact that fn is not a single\nsolution but a one\u2013parameter family of solutions depending on the blow up time T . We will refer to this\ninstability as the gauge instability. Thus, without further considerations the best we can expect is to\nprove a result that excludes the existence of solutions of eq. (5) with fn = f0 that grow faster than this\ngauge instability. In what follows we will address this issue by using an operator theoretic approach.\n\n4\n\nOperator Formulation\n\nIn order to simplify the problem further we define a new unknown \u03c6\u0303 by \u03c6\u0303(\u03c3, \u03c1) := e\u2212\u03c3 \u03c6(\u03c3, \u03c1) to remove\nthe first\u2013order term \u22122\u03c6\u03c3 . Eq. (5) transforms into\n\u03c6\u0303\u03c3\u03c3 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03c12 )2 \u03c6\u0303\u03c1\u03c1 \u2212\n\n4.1\n\n2(1 \u2212 \u03c12 ) cos(2fn ) \u2212 \u03c12\n2(1 \u2212 \u03c12 )2\n\u03c6\u0303\u03c1 +\n\u03c6\u0303 = 0.\n\u03c1\n\u03c12\n\n(6)\n\nThe Operator An\n\nWe define the formal Sturm\u2013Liouville differential expression an on the interval (0, 1) by\nan u :=\n\n1\n(\u2212(pu\u2032 )\u2032 + qn u)\nw\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\ncos(2fn (\u03c1))\u2212\u03c1\n\u03c1\n2\nand qn (\u03c1) := 2(1\u2212\u03c1 )(1\u2212\u03c1\n. Thus, an represents the spatial\nwhere w(\u03c1) := (1\u2212\u03c1\n2 )2 , p(\u03c1) := \u03c1\n2 )2\ndifferential operator in eq. (6). We define the weighted Hilbert space H := L2w (0, 1) where L2w (0, 1)\nconsists of (equivalence classes of) functions which are square integrable with respect to the weight w,\ni.e. the inner product (*|*)H on H is given by\nZ 1\n(u|v)H =\nu(\u03c1)v(\u03c1)w(\u03c1)d\u03c1\n0\n\nand as usual we write k * kH :=\nAn u := an u for u \u2208 D(An ).\n\np\n\n(*|*)H . We set D(An ) := {u \u2208 H : u, pu\u2032 \u2208 ACloc (0, 1), an u \u2208 H} and\n\n3\n\n\fLemma 4.1. The operator An : D(An ) \u2282 H \u2192 H is self\u2013adjoint.\nProof. Consider solutions of an u = 0. Since the coefficients of this linear ordinary differential equation\nare meromorphic and \u03c1 = 0 as well as \u03c1 = 1 are regular singular points, we can apply Frobenius' method\nto obtain series representations for solutions around \u03c1 = 0 and \u03c1 = 1. Around \u03c1 = 0 the Frobenius\nindices are \u22122 and 1, i.e. only one nontrivial solution belongs to H. According to the Weyl alternative\nwe conclude that \u03c1 = 0 is in the limit\u2013point case (cf. e.g. [20]). Similarly, around \u03c1 = 1 the indices are\nboth 12 and thus, neither of the two linearly independent solutions belongs to H which shows that \u03c1 = 1\nis in the limit\u2013point case as well. It follows that the maximal operator An associated to an is self\u2013adjoint\n(cf. [20]).\n\n4.2\n\nFactorization of A0\n\nVery similar to the energy critical case [10] there exists a factorization of the linearized operator A0 that\nimmediately implies its nonnegativity. To see this, note first that the potential term in eq. (5) for the\nground state f0 can be rewritten according to\ncos(2f0 (\u03c1)) = cos(4 arctan \u03c1) =\n\n1 \u2212 6\u03c12 + \u03c14\n.\n(1 + \u03c12 )2\n\nNow we define two first\u2013order operators B and B\u0302 on H by D(B) := D(B\u0302) := Cc\u221e (0, 1) as well as\nBu(\u03c1) := (1 \u2212 \u03c12 )u\u2032 (\u03c1) \u2212\nand\nB\u0302u(\u03c1) := \u2212(1 \u2212 \u03c12 )u\u2032 (\u03c1) \u2212\n\n1 \u2212 3\u03c12\nu(\u03c1)\n\u03c1(1 + \u03c12 )\n3 \u2212 \u03c12\nu(\u03c1).\n\u03c1(1 + \u03c12 )\n\nA simple integration by parts shows that (Bu|v)H = (u|B\u0302v)H for all u, v \u2208 Cc\u221e (0, 1) and thus, B and\nB\u0302 are adjoint to each other. Furthermore, by a direct computation one verifies that A0 u = B\u0302Bu for\nall u \u2208 Cc\u221e (0, 1) which is the desired factorization. We immediately obtain (A0 u|u)H = (B\u0302Bu|u)H =\n(Bu|Bu)H \u2265 0 for all u \u2208 Cc\u221e (0, 1). Since A0 is limit\u2013point at both endpoints it follows that Cc\u221e (0, 1)\nis a core for A0 and the estimate (A0 u|u) \u2265 0 extends to all u \u2208 D(A0 ) by a density argument. Thus,\nA0 is nonnegative and we have \u03c3(A0 ) \u2282 [0, \u221e).\n\n4.3\n\nThe Spectrum of An\n\nProposition 4.1. The point spectrum \u03c3p (An ) of An consists of exactly n negative eigenvalues, i.e.\n\u03c3p (An ) = {\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn : 0 > \u03bb1 > * * * > \u03bbn }. Furthermore, the essential spectrum \u03c3e (An ) is given by\n\u03c3e (An ) = [0, \u221e).\n\u221a\n\nProof. Consider the equation (\u03bb \u2212 an )u = 0. The Frobenius indices around \u03c1 = 1 are 1\u00b1 2 \u2212\u03bb . Thus, for\n\u03bb \u2265 0 neither of the two linearly independent solutions belongs to H which shows \u03c3p (An ) \u2282 (\u2212\u221e, 0).\nFurthermore, we conclude \u03c3e (An ) = [0, \u221e) by [18], p. 165, Theorem\np 11.5c.\nAs already discussed, the function \u03b8n defined by \u03b8n (\u03c1) := \u03c1 1 \u2212 \u03c12 fn\u2032 (\u03c1) is a solution of an u = 0.\nBizo\u0144 [2] has shown that fn (\u03c1) \u2208 (0, \u03c0) for \u03c1 \u2208 (0, 1] and thus, if fn > \u03c02 , it can only have one maximum\nsince\nsin(2fn (\u03c1))\nfn\u2032\u2032 (\u03c1) = 2\n<0\n\u03c1 (1 \u2212 \u03c12 )\n\nfor fn\u2032 (\u03c1) = 0 (cf. eq. (3)). Similarly, if fn < \u03c02 , it can only have one minimum. Hence, the number of\nextrema of fn equals the number of intersections of fn with the line \u03c02 on (0, 1) and therefore, \u03b8n has\nexactly n zeros on (0, 1).\nApplying the transformation v(x) := sinh(x)u(tanh x), the equation (\u03bb \u2212 an )u = 0 reduces to the\neigenvalue problem\n2\n(7)\n\u03bbv(x) + v \u2032\u2032 (x) \u2212 2 v(x) \u2212 Qn (x)v(x) = 0\nx\nwhere\n2\n2 cos(2fn (tanh x))\n\u2212 2.\nQn (x) :=\nx\nsinh2 x\n\n4\n\n\fConsequently, the function \u03c6n (x) := sinh(x)\u03b8n (tanh x) is a solution of eq. (7) with \u03bb = 0 which has\nexactly n zeros on x \u2208 (0, \u221e). Observe that the mapping u 7\u2192 v is an isometry from L2w (0, 1) to L2 (0, \u221e)\nand thus, the study of An is equivalent to the spectral problem for the l = 1 radial Schr\u00f6dinger operator\non L2 (0, \u221e) with potential Qn . Note that Qn \u2208 L\u221e (0, \u221e) and from the Frobenius analysis of an it\nfollows that the asymptotic behaviour of nontrivial solutions of eq. (7) is the same as if Qn \u2208 Cc\u221e (0, \u221e).\nThus, the results of [9], XIII.3.B apply and we conclude that An has exactly n eigenvalues below the\nessential spectrum.\nRemark 4.1. This observation has already been made by Bizo\u0144 [4]. Note further that \u03b8n is not an\neigenfunction since it does not belong to H!\nRemark\n4.2. Negative eigenvalues of An lead to unstable mode solutions of eq. (5), i.e. \u03c6(\u03c3, \u03c1) :=\n\u221a\ne(1+ \u2212\u03bb)\u03c3 v(\u03c1) is a solution of eq. (5) if \u03bb < 0 belongs to \u03c3p (An ) and v is the associated eigenfunction.\nThus, the n\u2013th self\u2013similar solution has exactly n unstable modes.\n\n5 Well\u2013Posedness of the Linearized Problem and Growth\nof Solutions\nWe consider the linear Cauchy problem\n\uf6be\n\u00fc(\u03c3) + A0 u(\u03c3) = 0 for \u03c3 > 0\nu(0) = u0 , u\u0307(0) = u1\n\n(8)\n\nd\nfor a function u : [0, \u221e) \u2192 H and u0 , u1 \u2208 D(A0 ) where  \u0307 := d\u03c3\nand differentiation with respect to \u03c3 is\nunderstood in the strong sense. Eq. (8) is an operator formulation of eq. (6) with fn = f0 and thus, it\ndescribes the (rescaled) linear flow around the self\u2013similar wave map f0 .\nAccording to the spectral theorem for self\u2013adjoint operators (see e.g. [19]) there exists a spectral\nfamily {E(\u03bb) : \u03bb \u2208 R} of orthogonal projections associated to A0 such that for u \u2208 D(A0 ) and v \u2208 H we\nhave\nZ\n(A0 u|v)H = idR d\u03bcu,v\n\nwhere \u03bcu,v := 14 (\u03bcu+v \u2212 \u03bcu\u2212v + i\u03bcu\u2212iv \u2212 i\u03bcu+iv ) and \u03bcu is the unique measure defined on the Borel\u2013\n\u03c3\u2013algebra on R that satisfies \u03bcu ((\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 ]) = k(E(\u03bb2 ) \u2212 E(\u03bb1 ))uk2H for u \u2208 H. Moreover, with the help\nof the spectral family {E(\u03bb)} it is possible to define\nR functions of self\u2013adjoint operators.\nR Let f : R \u2192 C\nbe measureable and set D(f (A0 )) := {u \u2208 H : |f |2 d\u03bcu < \u221e}, (f (A0 )u|v)H := f d\u03bcu,v for any\nu \u2208 D(f (A0 )) and v \u2208 H. Note that in fact only the values of f on the spectrum of A0 contribute.\nThis yields a well\u2013defined linear operator f (A0 ) : D(f (A0 )) \u2282 H \u2192 H which behaves nicely (see [19] for\ndetails and a functional calculus).\nProposition 5.1. Let u0 , u1 \u2208 D(A0 ). Then, the Cauchy problem eq. (8) has a unique solution u :\n1/2\n[0, \u221e) \u2192 D(A0 ) \u2282 H and the real\u2013valued function \u03c3 7\u2192 kA0 u(\u03c3)k2H + ku\u0307(\u03c3)k2H is constant for all\n\u03c3 \u2265 0.\nProof. We set\ng\u03c3 (\u03bb) :=\n1/2\n\n\uf6be\n\n1/2\n\nsin(\u03c3\u03bb)\u03bb\u22121 for \u03bb > 0\n\u03c3 for \u03bb \u2264 0\n\n1/2\n\nand define u(\u03c3) := cos(\u03c3A0 )u0 + g\u03c3 (A0 )u1 via the functional calculus. Note that A0 is well\u2013\ndefined since \u03c3(A0 ) = [0, \u221e). Applying Lebesgue's theorem on dominated convergence one immediately\nconcludes that \u00fc(\u03c3) + A0 u(\u03c3) = 0 and clearly, u satisfies the initial conditions. Furthermore, it follows\neasily that u(\u03c3) and u\u0307(\u03c3) stay in D(A0 ) for all \u03c3 > 0. A direct computation (functional calculus) yields\n1/2\n1/2\nkA0 u(\u03c3)k2H + ku\u0307(\u03c3)k2H = kA0 u0 k2H + ku1 k2H which implies uniqueness as well.\n1/2\n\n1/2\n\n1/2\n\nNote that (u0 , u1 ) 7\u2192 kA0 u0 k2H + ku1 k2H defines a norm on D(A0 ) \u00d7 H since 0 \u2208\n/ \u03c3p (A0 ) and\nhence, there do not exist growing solutions of eq. (8) which is the desired result. Thus, in view of the\ntransformation \u03c6 7\u2192 \u03c6\u0303 we have shown that there do not exist linear perturbations of f0 that grow faster\nthan the gauge instability.\n\n5\n\n\f6\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe give a heuristic explanation why one cannot go any further in this formulation. This is most easily\nseen within a first\u2013order formulation. Let u : [0, \u221e) \u2192 H be the unique solution of eq. (8) with initial\ndata u0 , u1 \u2208 D(A0 ) and set \u03c6(\u03c3, *) := e\u03c3 u(\u03c3). Then, \u03c6 satisfies the first\u2013order equation\nd\nu(\u03c3) = Lu(\u03c3)\nd\u03c3\nwhere u(\u03c3) := (\u03c6(\u03c3, *), \u03c6\u03c3 (\u03c3, *)) and\nL :=\n\n\u201e\n\n1\n\u2212A0\n\n1\n1\n\n\u00ab\n\n.\n\n\u03c6 (resp. u) describes the linear flow around the self\u2013similar wave map f0 . Consider the operator\n1/2\nL on the Banach space X := D(A0 ) \u00d7 H with norm k(u1 , u2 )k2X := ku1 k2 1/2 + ku2 k2H and D(L) :=\nA0\n\n1/2\nD(A0 )\u00d7D(A0 )\n\nwhere k*kA1/2 denotes the graph norm of\n0\n\n1/2\nA0 .\n\nThen, it is easily seen that the spectrum\n\nof L can be calculated from the spectrum of A0 and it is given by \u03c3(L) = {z \u2208 C : \u2212(z \u2212 1)2 \u2208 \u03c3(A0 )}\nwhich shows that \u03c3(L) = {z \u2208 C : Re(z) = 1}. We have already discussed the gauge instability which\ncorresponds to the point 1 \u2208 \u03c3(L). Thus, the origin of the point 1 \u2208 \u03c3(L) is well\u2013understood and in\nfact, we are only interested in stability of f0 \"modulo this gauge instability\". If 1 \u2208 \u03c3(L) would be an\nisolated point one could define a projection operator to remove this instability. However, the rest of the\nspectrum makes this impossible and in what follows we give an intuitive explanation where it emanates\nfrom. The reason for this is a serious defect of the coordinate system (\u03c3, \u03c1). As already mentioned, it\ncovers only the interior of the backward lightcone of the point (T, 0). Thus, an outgoing wave packet\ncan never leave the backward lightcone but cumulates near \u03c1 = 1 as \u03c3 increases. This corresponds to\nan apparent instability which shows up in the spectrum of L. Unfortunately, one cannot go around this\ndifficulty unless one changes coordinates which destroys the self\u2013adjoint character of the problem. Thus,\nthe result that there do not exist linear perturbations of f0 that grow faster than the gauge instability is\nthe best one can have in this formulation but still, it strongly supports the conjecture of stability of the\nwave map f0 .\n\n7\n\nThe Operators An for n \u2192 \u221e\n\nThe self\u2013similar wave maps fn can be constructed numerically using a shooting and matching technique\n[1]. By the same method one may\npcalculate the point spectrum of An (cf. [4]). Results for A1 , . . . , A4\nare given in Table 1 where \u03bcj := \u2212\u03bbj .\n\n7.1\n\nThe Operator A\u221e\n\nWe emphasize the remarkable fact that the horizontal rows in Table 1 seem to converge. The question is\nif one can construct an operator A\u221e such that the point spectrum of A\u221e is the limit of the point spectra\nof An for n \u2192 \u221e. Since fn \u2192 f\u221e \u2261 \u03c02 pointwise on (0, 1], the obvious strategy is to investigate linear\nperturbations around f\u221e described by eq. (6) with fn = f\u221e . Thus, we consider the Sturm\u2013Liouville\nexpression\n1\na\u221e u := (\u2212(pu\u2032 )\u2032 + q\u221e u)\nw\n2\n\n\u22122+\u03c1\nwhere q\u221e (\u03c1) := (1\u2212\u03c1\n2 )2 . Again, we use Frobenius' method to classify the endpoints. The behaviour of\nsolutions of a\u221e u = 0 around \u03c1 = 1 is the same as before for an \u221a\nand thus, \u03c1 = 1 is in the limit\u2013point\n7\nand thus, all solutions of a\u221e u = 0\ncase again. However, around \u03c1 = 0 the Frobenius indices are \u22121\u00b1i\n2\nbelong to H near \u03c1 = 0. According to the Weyl alternative the point \u03c1 = 0 is in the limit\u2013circle case\nand hence, we have to specify a boundary condition of the form [u, \u03c7]p (0) = 0 for a fixed function \u03c7\nin order to obtain a self\u2013adjoint operator (cf. [20]). The question is how to choose \u03c7. Bizo\u0144 [3] has\nstudied an analogous problem for a Yang\u2013Mills system. Following his proposal we choose \u03c7 in such a\nway that a\u221e u = 0 has a nontrivial solution just like the gauge instability for an . Thus, we denote by\n\u03c7\u0303 a real\u2013valued nontrivial function satisfying a\u221e \u03c7\u0303 = 0 with asymptotic behaviour \u03c7\u0303(\u03c1) \u223c (1 \u2212 \u03c1)1/2 for\n\u03c1 \u2192 1. Such a function exists by Frobenius' method and it is unique up to constant multiples since the\n\n6\n\n\fsecond linearly independent solution around \u03c1 = 1 contains a log term. Using an appropriate smooth\ncut\u2013off function we construct a \u03c7 that coincides with \u03c7\u0303 on (0, 12 ) and satisfies \u03c7, a\u221e \u03c7 \u2208 H as well as\n\u03c7, p\u03c7\u2032 \u2208 ACloc (0, 1). Then, we define\nD(A\u221e ) := {u \u2208 H : u, pu\u2032 \u2208 ACloc (0, 1), a\u221e u \u2208 H, [u, \u03c7]p (0) = 0}\nand A\u221e u := a\u221e u for u \u2208 D(A\u221e ). Invoking Sturm\u2013Liouville theory [20] we conclude that A\u221e : D(A\u221e ) \u2282\nH \u2192 H is self\u2013adjoint.\n\n7.2\n\nThe Point Spectrum of A\u221e\n\nSince the asymptotic behaviour of solutions of (\u03bb\u2212a\u221e)u = 0 around \u03c1 = 1 is the same as for (\u03bb\u2212an)u = 0,\nwe conclude that \u03c3p (A\u221e ) \u2282 (\u2212\u221e, 0). Thus, we restrict ourselves to \u03bb < 0. The eigenvalue equation\n(\u03bb \u2212 a\u221e )u = 0 is a linear ordinary differential equation of second order with four regular singular points\n\u03c1 = 0, \u00b11, \u221e. However, applying the transformation \u03c1 7\u2192 z := \u03c12 we can reduce this number by 1 and\nwe are left with the three regular singular points z = 0, 1, \u221e. Thus, solutions are given in terms of\nhypergeometric functions (cf. [5]). We define a new unknown\n\u221a\nv(z) := z \u03b1 (1 \u2212 z)\u03b2 u( z)\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwhere \u03b1 := \u2212 41 (\u22121 + i 7) and \u03b2 := \u2212 21 (1 + \u2212\u03bb). The equation (\u03bb \u2212 a\u221e )u = 0 transforms into\nz(1 \u2212 z)v \u2032\u2032 + [c \u2212 (a + b + 1)z]v \u2032 \u2212 abv = 0\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwhere a := 14 (1 + 2 \u2212\u03bb + i 7), b := 14 (3 + 2 \u2212\u03bb + i 7) and c := 1 + i 2 7 . The solution v1 (*, \u03bb) defined\nby v1 (z, \u03bb) := 2 F1 (a, b; a + b + 1 \u2212 c; 1 \u2212 z) corresponds to the solution of (\u03bb \u2212 a\u221e )u = 0 which belongs\nto H near \u03c1 = 1. v1 can be written as a linear combination of the form\nv1 (z, \u03bb) \u221d 2 F1 (a, b; c; z) + m(\u03bb)z 1\u2212c 2 F1 (a + 1 \u2212 c, b + 1 \u2212 c; 2 \u2212 c; z)\nwhere the connection coefficient m(\u03bb) can be given in terms of the \u0393\u2013function [5] and reads\nm(\u03bb) =\n\n\u0393(a + 1 \u2212 c)\u0393(b + 1 \u2212 c)\u0393(c \u2212 1)\n.\n\u0393(a)\u0393(b)\u0393(1 \u2212 c)\n\nThus, the boundary condition at \u03c1 = 0 translates into m(\u03bb) = m(0). This transcendental equation can\nbe solved numerically and the results are given in Table 1.\n\n\u03bcn\n\u03bc1\n\u03bc2\n\u03bc3\n\nA1\n5.333625\n\nA2\n5.304\n58.0701\n\nA3\n5.30\n57.68\n625\n\nA4\n5.3\n57.6\n620\n\nA\u221e\n5.3009\n57.637\n619.61\n\nTable 1: Approximate eigenvalues\nThus, as conjectured, the point spectrum of A\u221e seems to be the limit of the point spectra of An .\n\n8\n\nGeneralization to higher equivariance indices\n\nFinally, we consider more general equivariant wave maps described by the equation\n\u03c8tt \u2212 \u03c8rr \u2212\n\nl(l + 1) sin(2\u03c8)\n2\n\u03c8r +\n=0\nr\n2\nr2\n\n(9)\n\nwhere l \u2208 N is the equivariance index (see e.g. [12] for a derivation of this equation). Self\u2013similar\nsolutions \u03c8(t, r) = f ( T r\u2212t ) of eq. (9) satisfy\nf \u2032\u2032 +\n\n2 \u2032 l(l + 1) sin(2f )\nf \u2212\n=0\n\u03c1\n2\n\u03c12 (1 \u2212 \u03c12 )\n\n7\n\n\fand again, we require f (0) = 0 and f (1) = \u03c02 as regularity conditions. Bizo\u0144's proof of the existence of\na countable set {fn,l : n = 0, 1, 2 . . . } of self\u2013similar solutions carries over to this more general situation\n(see [2]). In fact, the solutions fn,l have analogous properties for all l. The index n counts the number\nof intersections of fn,l with the line \u03c02 in the interval \u03c1 \u2208 [0, 1) and we have fn,l (\u03c1) \u2208 (0, \u03c0) for all n and\n\u03c1 \u2208 (0, 1]. Furthermore, the asymptotic behaviour of fn,l for \u03c1 \u2192 0 is fn,l (\u03c1) \u223c \u03c1l .\nLinear perturbations \u03c6 around fn,l satisfy the evolution equation\n\u03c6\u03c3\u03c3 \u2212 2\u03c6\u03c3 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03c12 )2 \u03c6\u03c1\u03c1 \u2212\n\nl(l + 1)(1 \u2212 \u03c12 ) cos(2fn,l )\n2(1 \u2212 \u03c12 )2\n\u03c6\u03c1 +\n\u03c6=0\n\u03c1\n\u03c12\n\nand analogous to the case l = 1 we define the Sturm\u2013Liouville expressions an,l by\nan,l u :=\nwhere w(\u03c1) :=\n\n\u03c12\n,\n(1\u2212\u03c12 )2\n\n1\n(\u2212(pu\u2032 )\u2032 + qn,l u)\nw\n\np(\u03c1) := \u03c12 and\nqn,l (\u03c1) :=\n\nl(l + 1)(1 \u2212 \u03c12 ) cos(2fn,l (\u03c1)) \u2212 \u03c12\n.\n(1 \u2212 \u03c12 )2\n\nThe Frobenius indices for the equation an,l u = 0 are {\u2212l \u2212 1, l} at \u03c1 = 0 and { 12 , 21 } at \u03c1 = 1 and\nthus, both endpoints are in the limit\u2013point case. It follows that the associated maximal operator An,l\non H = L2w (0, 1) is self\u2013adjoint. Again, the study of An,l is equivalent to the spectral problem for the\nradial Schr\u00f6dinger operator and thus, the rest of the analysis remains unchanged. Hence, we have the\nfollowing theorem.\nTheorem 8.1. The spectrum of An,l consists of a continuous part \u03c3e (An,l ) = [0, \u221e) and exactly n\nnegative eigenvalues. As a consequence, A0,l is nonnegative, the Cauchy problem\n\uf6be\n\u00fc(\u03c3) + A0,l u(\u03c3) = 0 for \u03c3 > 0\nu(0) = u0 , u\u0307(0) = u1\n1/2\n\nfor u0 , u1 \u2208 D(A0,l ) is well\u2013posed and the real\u2013valued function \u03c3 7\u2192 kA0,l u(\u03c3)k2H + ku\u0307(\u03c3)k2H is constant\nfor all \u03c3 \u2265 0.\n\n9\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors would like to thank Piotr Bizo\u0144 and Horst R.
