In this paper, we discuss this technique, and present some results\nand performances.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nSince the great success of the Standard Model in the recent decades, there has been no doubt that the\ngauge theories are capable to describe the interactions between elementary particles. With larger colliding\nenergy available to probe higher energy scattering events, only remained piece of the Standard Model,\nHiggs boson(s), will be also discovered in the current and future colliders. Besides, a new physics might\nbe opened in this high energy frontier. Among these energy scale, precise predictions by the perturbative\ncalculations is crucial for the signal and background estimations because their event topologies become\nmuch complicate with increasing the colliding energy. We have carried on the automatic computation\nof the Feynman diagrams by GRACE [1] system since we immediately have a huge number of diagram\ncalculation in multi-particle final state processes although we can, in principle, calculate them by hand\nbased on their Lagrangian in perturbation theory.\nGRACE has satisfied this requirement at one-loop level [2] in the electroweak interactions as well as\nat tree level and at the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM) [3]. Those\ndevelopment has been mostly aimed at applications to lepton collisions. The generated codes however\nare not directly applicable to hadron-collision interactions due to the presence of a parton distribution\nfunction (PDF). Also, a certain process in hadron collisions consists of lots of subprocesses by referring\nincoming partons in PDF or outgoing partons in jets. In current scheme, it leads much time for the\ndiagram calculations. We clearly need an extended framework of the GRACE system for hadron collisions.\nEarly extensions can be seen in [4] and [5].\nIn order to implement those features specific to hadron collisions, we have developed an extended\nframework, called GR@PPA (GRace At PP/Anti-p). The primary function of GR@PPA is to determine\nthe initial and final state partons, i.e. their flavors and momenta in the incoming partons by referring\nto a PDF and the final state parton configuration if the process requires jets or decay products from\nmassive bosons. Based on the GRACE output codes, GR@PPA calculates the cross section and generates\nunweighted parton-level events using BASES/SPRING [6] included in the GRACE system. The GR@PPA\nframework also includes an interface for a common data format (LHA) [7] with the common interface\nroutines proposed at Les Houches Workshop on 2001[8]. To make the events realistic, the unweighted\nevent data are passed through the showering-MC of PYTHIA [9] or HERWIG [10] which implements the\ninitial- and final-state radiation, hadronization and decays and so forth.\nAlthough the GR@PPA framework is not process-specific and can be applied to any other processes\nin hadron collisions using the output codes of the GRACE system1 , we also provide some primitive\nprocesses packed as a set of matrix element customized for this extension. At the moment, the selected\nprocesses are boson(s) plus n jets processes and tt\u0304 plus m jets processes, where n(m) is accounted for up\n1 The\n\nextension of GRACE itself to the hadron collisions is under development.\n\n1\n\n\fto 4(1) jets. These processes are the most important background processes for the Higgs boson searches\nor the SUSY particle searches as well as the precise measurements for the understandings of multi-body\nparticle dynamics. Our previous work, four bottom quark production processes (GR@PPA 4b [11]),\nis also included. The reasons why we also provide the particular processes apart from the benefit of\nthe automatic Feynman diagram calculation by the GRACE system are followings. First, kinematical\nsingularities in each process are cared with a proper treatment. Since the kinematics are optimized\nto be suitable for well-convergence behavior, one can get high efficiency to generate unweighted events\nwithout any care. This is immediately addressed to the program running speed which is critical for\nthe large scale MC production. Second, it is easy to adopt the higher order calculations. In higher\norder calculations, the calculation procedure is normally process-specific. To avoid the negative weight\nin cancellation between virtual and loop correction, one requires the phase space points to be positive\ndifferential cross section. This feature is so difficult to generalize by the automatic Feynman diagram\ncalculation. Once the customized matrix element for the NLO process is prepared [12], one can simply\nuse it. Third, some extensions are possible only in the modification of the framework. For example,\nusing an ability of C++ language, the GR@PPA generators will work in the C++ environment just by\nrewriting the framework by C++ but the others are still Fortran. This is minimum changes to wrap the\nFortran code produced by the GRACE system. The parton shower algorithm, for example NLL parton\nshower [13], is also possible to implement by modifying the framework because the parton shower is not a\nprocess specific model. Note that the extended GRACE system for hadron collisions will work to provide\na set of matrix elements apart from the GR@PPA framework at these point.\nIn this paper, we describe a symbolic treatment of the diagram calculation adopted in GR@PPA for\nhadron collisions in the next section. Some benchmark cross sections and program performances are\npresented in Section 3. Our numerical results were compared with several generators [14, 15, 16, 17]. We\ngot a good agreement with them [18]. Finally, a summary is given in Section 4.\n\n2\n\nExtension of GRACE to pp/pp\u0304 collisions\n\nIn hadron-hadron collision, a certain process consists of several incoherent subprocesses according to\ncolliding partons in the hadrons. If the given process has a decay or a jet in the final state, the whole\npossible combinations of the outgoing partons are also taken into account for. The total cross section is\nthus expressed as a simple summation of those subprocesses in Eq.(1)\nZ\nZ\nXZ\nd\u03c3\u0302ij\u2192F (\u015d)\n,\n(1)\n\u03c3=\ndx1 dx2 d\u03a6\u0302F fi1 (x1 , Q2 )fj2 (x2 , Q2 )\nd\u03a6\u0302F\ni,j,F\nwhere fia (xa , Q2 ) is a PDF of the hadron a (p or p\u0304), which gives the probability to find the parton i\nwith an energy fraction xa at a probing virtuality of Q2 . The differential cross section d\u03c3\u0302ij\u2192F (\u015d)/d\u03a6\u0302F\ndescribes the parton-level hard interaction producing the final-state F from a collision of partons, i and\nj, where \u015d is the square of the total initial 4-momentum. The sum is taken over all relevant combinations\nof i, j and F . We had mainly two sorts of development in GR@PPA, - applying PDF in the phase space\nintegration and sharing several subprocesses as a single base-subprocess. The former is described in our\nprevious paper [11]. Here, we focus on the later case.\nThe original GRACE system assumes that both the initial and final states are well-defined. Hence, it\ncan be applied to evaluating d\u03c3\u0302ij\u2192F (\u015d)/d\u03a6\u0302F and its integration over the final-state phase space \u03a6\u0302F only.\nAn adequate extension is necessary to take into account the variation of the initial and final states both in\nparton species and their momenta, in order to make the GRACE system applicable to hadron collisions.\nAs already mentioned, a \"process\" of interest is usually composed of several incoherent subprocesses in\nhadron interactions. However, in many cases, the difference between the subprocesses is the difference in\nthe quark combination in the initial and/or final states only. The matrix element of these subprocesses\nis frequently identical, or the difference is only in a few coupling parameters and/or masses. In such\ncases, it is convenient to add one more integration/differentiation variable to replace the summation in\nEq.(1) with an integration. As a result, these subprocesses can share an identical \"GRACE output code\"\nand can be treated as a single subprocess. This technique simplifies the program code and saves the\ncomputing time very much.\n2\n\n\fThe number of the combinations taken N out of M flavors allowing to overlap them, in general, is given\n+M\u22121)!\n \u0304\nby M HN (\u2261 (N\nN !(M\u22121)! ). In case that all parton flavors are considered, M = 11(u, d, c, s, b, g, \u016b, d, c\u0304, s\u0304, b\u0304),\nthen the configuration of the N jets final state has 11 HN subprocesses if we neglect the conservation by\ntotal amount of charges of this subprocess. Clearly we can see that smaller M decreases the number of\nsubprocesses. Unless the flavor difference is taken account in the process, the flavor configurations can\nbe replaced by a generic up-type, down-type parton, and gluon (5 HN \u226a 11 HN ). The base-subprocesses\nare thus configured only as to have those partons and gluon. The output code of the matrix element\nfrom the GRACE system is extended to have a function of input masses and couplings, so that the\nmasses and couplings are interchanged according to the assigned flavors. Note that each base-subprocess\ncovers every possible combination of flavors. The diagram selection in the base-subprocesses thus allows\nto specify all subprocesses with a proper flavor configuration. In addition, since the Feynman diagrams\nwithin the process of Standard Model are symmetry with respect to the momentum (parity) and charge\nflip of the initial colliding partons in the CM frame of the process, the subprocesses can be reduced more.\nIn Table 1, we list up the number of all possible base-subprocesses contributes in N jets process in pp(p\u0304)\ncollisions together with that of the subprocesses counted for all flavor combinations. The subprocesses are\nclassified according to the difference in the initial-state parton combination. That is, the initial parton\ncombinations in the base-subprocesses are qu qu (q \u0304d q \u0304d ), qu q \u0304d , qu g(q \u0304d g), qu qd , qu q \u0304u (qd q \u0304d ), gg, where qu (qd )\nand g is up(down)-type quarks, and gluon, respectively. We take them all positive side.\nThe integration of Eq.(1) has a weight factor for each subprocess. If a decay products from the\nresonance particles is separately taken account for the final state partons of N jets configuration, Eq.(2)\ncan be rewritten as\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nselected\nd\u03c3\u0302ij\u2192F\n(\u015d; m, \u03b1)\n,\n(2)\n\u03c3 = dwi,j,F\ndx1 dx2 d\u03a6\u0302F wi,j,F *\nd\u03a6\u0302F\nselected\nwhere d\u03c3\u0302ij\u2192F\nis the differential cross section of each subprocess with an input arguments of the masses\nand couplings. The matrix element is supplied by that of the base-subprocess. Based on the initial and\nfinal state parton configuration, the graph selection is applied to this base-subprocess, and masses and\ncouplings are given in the diagram calculation event by event. The wi,j,F is a weight factor for the initial\nand final state parton configuration, and can be expressed as\nX\nL\nwi,j,F =\nfi1 (x1 , Q2 )fj2 (x2 , Q2 ) * |VCKM |2K * {Br.(X \u2192 F \u2032 ) \u00d7 \u0393X\n(3)\ntot } ,\ni,j,F\n\nwhere an index K and L is the number of W and X bosons, respectively. A PDF is responsible for\nthe weight of the initial state parton configuration, and a squared coupling normalized by that of the\nbase-subprocess is responsible for the weight of the final state parton configuration. Note that the square\nof the CKM (Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa) [19] matrix parameter remains after normalization of the\ncoupling of the base-subprocess depending on the number of the W bosons K. If the X boson presents\nin the Feynman diagrams and decay into F \u2032 without interference with the other partons, where F \u2032 is\na member of the final state particles, then the fraction of the decay is used as the weight factor. The\nbranching ratio and total width may be given by the experimental measured one.\n\n3\n\nResults\n\nThe total cross sections estimated by GR@PPA are presented in Table 2 for the single boson plus jets\nproductions and Table 3 for the double bosons plus jets productions, respectively, where all bosons decay\ninto electron and positron (e+ e\u2212 ) or electron(positron) and\n\u221a (anti-)electron-neutrino (e\u03bde ). Both are\nshown\nwith\nthe\ncases\nof\nTevatron\nRun-II\n(pp\u0304\ncollisions\nat\ns = 1.96 TeV) and LHC (pp collisions at\n\u221a\ns = 14 TeV) conditions with CTEQ5L [20] PDF. The renormalization and factorization scales (Q2 )\nare chosen to be identical, and those values are taken as the squared boson mass for the single boson\nproductions and the summation of squared boson masses for the double bosons productions processes.\nThe cuts are only applied for the final state partons (jets), with the values of pT > 8.0 GeV, |\u03b7| < 3.0,\nand \u2206R > 0.4 for Tevatron, and pT > 20 GeV, |\u03b7| < 3.0, and \u2206R > 0.4 for LHC conditions, but no cut\n3\n\n\fis applied for leptons from bosons. The integration accuracy achieved in BASES is fairly better than 1%\nfor all processes with the default settings of the mapping number for the integrations.\nThe performance of GR@PPA for the W + N jets processes in Tevatron Run-II condition is also\nsummarized in Table 4. Used processor is Intel Xeon 3.4 GHz processor. Tests are performed by two\ndifferent Fortran compilers: a free software of g77 ver.2.96 and a commercial compiler of Intel Fortran\nCompiler ver.8.0. The integration time and the generation speed are separately shown. Clearly, the\ncommercial compiler is \u223c 2.5 faster than the free compiler, but in both cases, those are not intolerable\ntime for the large scale Monte Carlo production. The generation efficiencies by SPRING are also shown.\nThese are within an order of a few percent for most of the processes. These numbers are exceptionally\ngood for this kind of complicated processes.\n\n4\n\nSummary\n\nWe have developed an extended framework, named GR@PPA, of the GRACE system for hadron collisions.\nWe have introduced the scheme to share some subprocesses as a single subprocess. We found that this\nextension allows us to incorporate the variation in the initial and final states parton configurations into\nthe GRACE system. The results for some processes with multi-parton configurations are presented, and\nwe found that the computing time for the diagram calculations is drastically reduced to be compared\nwith the original GRACE system which assumes that both the initial and final states are well-defined\nand the integration is performed for every each subprocess. Using this faculty of GR@PPA, we expect\nthat the event generator is suitable not only for a large scale Monte Carlo production at high luminosity\nhadron colliders of Tevatron or LHC, but also for future NLO calculations which is also composed of lots\nof subprocesses.\n\n5\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe author would like to thank all the people of the Minami-Tateya numerical calculation group and the\nATLAS-Japan Collaboration.
