The collapse of young massive stars or the coalescence of a black holeneutron star binary is expected to give rise to a black hole-torus system. When the torus\nis strongly magnetized, the black hole produces electron-positron outflow along open\nmagnetic field-lines. Through curvature radiation in gaps, this outflow rapidly develops\ninto a e\u00b1 \u03b3-wind, which is ultra-relativistic and of low comoving density, proposed here\nas a possible input to GRB fireball models.\n\nHere, I discuss some aspects of black holes when exposed to external magnetic\nfields. For example, black hole-torus systems are a probable outcome of the collapse\nof young massive stars [28,17] and the coalescence of black hole-neutron star binaries [18], both of which are possible progenitors of cosmological gamma-ray bursts\n(GRBs). If all black holes are produced by stellar collapse, they should be nearly\nmaximally rotating [1,2]. A surrounding torus or accretion disk is expected to be\nmagnetized by conservation of magnetic flux and linear amplification (cf. [17,15]).\nA black hole-torus system will have open magnetic field-lines from the horizon\nto infinity and closed magnetic field-lines between the black hole and the torus\n[23]. The closed magnetic field-lines mediate Maxwell stresses [24]. This may\nbe seen by way of similarity to pulsar magnetospheres [10]. In a poloidal crosssection, the torus can be identified with a pulsar which rotates at an angular velocity\n\u03a9P \u223c \u03a9H \u2212 \u03a9T , wherein the black hole horizon corresponds to infinity. Then, the\ninner light-surface [29] corresponds to the pulsar light-cylinder, and a 'bag' attached\nto the torus to the last closed field-line. Here, \u03a9H and \u03a9T denote the angular\nvelocities of the black hole and the torus, respectively. The work performed by the\nMaxwell stresses is commonly attributed to an outgoing Poynting flux emanating\nfrom the horizon [3,21]. These Maxwell stresses are likely to be important to the\nevolution of the torus, and tend to delay accretion onto the black hole. The open\nmagnetic field-lines, on the other hand, enable the black hole to produce an outflow\nto infinity. Such outflows generate emissions by deceleration against the interstellar\nmedium and through internal shocks.\nTo appear in: Explosive Phenom. Astrophys. Compact Objects, edited by C.-H. Lee, M. Rho, I. Yi & H.K. Lee, AIP Conf. Proc.\n\n\fHere, the outflow along open magnetic field-lines is studied, and found to produce\na pair-dominated e\u00b1 \u03b3\u2013wind in combination with curvature radiation.\nOpen field-lines from the horizon to infinity have radiative ingoing boundary\nconditions at the horizon as seen by zero-angular momentum observers (ZAMOs),\nand outgoing boundary conditions at infinity. It is well-known that for an outflow\nto exist, there must be regions in which pairs are created (gaps), somewhere on\nthese open field-lines [3,19,20,4]. The gaps are powered by an electric current I\nalong the field\u2013lines, which is limited by a horizon surface resistivity of 4\u03c0, in the\npresence of a certain potential drop across them. The net particle flow is limited\nby the black hole luminosity into the gap. The magnetosphere within the gaps\nis differentially rotating, beyond which the magnetosphere may be force-free and\nin rigid rotation. Note that, in contrast, the currents along closed magnetic fieldlines are fixed by the angular velocity \u03a9T of the surrounding matter, where the\ngaps are most likely residing between the horizon and the inner light surface. Of\ninterest here is the location of the gaps on the open magnetic field-lines and the\npower dissipated within, as sites of linear acceleration of charged particles and their\ncurvature radiation.\nA rotating black hole tends to produce electrons and positrons by spontaneous\nemission along open magnetic field-lines in an effort to evolve to a lower energy state\nby shedding off its angular momentum. Indeed, in the adiabatic limit, the radiated\nparticles possess a specific angular momentum of at least 2M, whereas the specific\nangular momentum of the black hole, a, is at most M. In the approximation of an\nasymptotically uniform magnetic field, e.g., in a Wald-field [27], the emissions at\ninfinity to satisfy a Fermi-Dirac distribution of radiative Landau states, neglecting\ncurvature radiation and magnetic mirror effects. This results from a modification to\nthe Hawking radiation process [25]. This is a highly idealized picture derived in the\nperturbative limit of small particle densities, which will be modified significantly\nby curvature radiation and the formation of force-free regions. The spontaneous\nemission process concerns particles with energy-at-infinity \u03c9 below the Fermi-level\nVF . Here, VF is the energy-at-infinity associated with the particles as seen on a\nnull-generator of the horizon, such as the ZAMO-derivative \u03be a \u2202a = \u2202t \u2212 \u03b2\u2202\u03c6 , where\n\u03b2 denotes the angular velocity of the sky as seen by ZAMOs. That is,\nVF \u03c8 = [\u03be a Da ]H\n\u221e \u03c8 = (\u03bd\u03a9H \u2212 eV )\u03c8,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03a9H is the angular velocity of the horizon, using the sign-convention \u03c8 \u221d\ne\u2212i\u03c9t ei\u03bd\u03c6 . The energy-at-infinity \u03c9 and the azimuthal quantum number \u03bd are associated with the asymptotically time-like Killing vector \u2202t and azimuthal Killing\nvector \u2202\u03c6 , whereas Da = i\u22121 \u2202a + eAa denotes the gauge-covariant derivative in the\npresence of an electromagnetic vector potential Aa . In calculating VF , it is relevant to identify the ground state of the black hole-magnetic field configuration. It\nhas been shown that the lowest energy state, in the process of an angular momentum exchange between the black hole and the surrounding electromagnetic field by\nvariations of the horizon charge q, assumes when q = 2BJ [27,7], where J is the\n\n\fangular momentum of the black hole. Rotation of the equilibrium charge q = 2BJ\non the horizon recovers 4\u03c0BM 2 as the maximal horizon flux of the magnetic field\nfrom the uncharged flux 4\u03c0BM 2 cos \u03bb, where sin \u03bb = J/M 2 [7,25]. With the sign\nconvention that B is parallel to \u03a9H , we then have VF = \u03bd\u03a9H with \u03bd = eA\u03c6 (for\ne\u2212 ) and Aa = B(\u2202\u03c6 )a /2 in the Wald electrostatic equilibrium state. Note that the\nspontaneous emission process is anti-symmetric under pair-conjugation.\nThe rate of spontaneous emission is given by a certain barrier transmission coefficient in the level-crossing picture of electrons and positrons [6]. This follows from\nframe-dragging by \u03b2, and the resulting shift between the energy-at-infinity \u03c9 and\nthe energy \u03c9Z as seen by ZAMOs:\nq\n\n\u03c9Z = \u00b1 m2e + |eB|(2n + 1 \u00b1 \u03b1) = \u03c9 + \u03bd\u03b2 =\n\n(\n\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u03bd\u03a9H on the horizon\n\u03c9\nat infinity.\n\n(2)\n\nHere, it is the quantum number \u03bd which gives rise to different energies between\nZAMOs and Boyer-Linquist observers. Figure 1 (a) shows an equivalent classical\npicture, where the frame-dragging \u03b2 induces a potential energy VBL = e\u03b2A\u03c6 on a\nflux surface A\u03c6 =const. with respect to the axis of rotation, itself at zero potential\nin the q = 2BJ state. Since \u03b2 describes a differentially rotating space-time, it\nvaries with distance to the black hole and VBL introduces a potential energy drop\nalong the magnetic field-lines. When sufficiently strong, a Schwinger-type process\nis set in place, which locally produces pairs at a certain rate per unit volume.\nFormally, the rate of pair-production follows from a scattering calculation in the\nWKB approximation [14,9,6] (cf. also [13]). The pair-production rate is found to be\n2\ngiven by a barrier transmission coefficient \u0393 \u223c e\u2212\u03c0Bc /B\u03b8 , where Bc = m2e /e = 4.4 \u00d7\n1013 G is the QED value of the magnetic field-strength and \u03b8 is the poloidal angle in\nBoyer-Linquist coordinates. More precisely, the gradient \u03b7 = \u2212\u2207VBL parallel to B\ndrives a pair-production rate per unit volume by a Schwinger-process d2 N/dtdV \u223c\n2\n(B >> Bc , a \u223c M). This pair-production process will be\n(e2 \u03b7B/4\u03c0 2 )e\u2212\u03c0Bc /\u03b7\u03b8\nin place, whenever the charge-density is low so that the magnetosphere remains in\ndifferential rotation.\nThe magnetosphere on open field\u2013lines away from a gap assumes a force-free,\nrigidly rotating state with a Goldreich-Julian charge density [3,21,22]. This is\nsimilar to the analogous case in pulsar magnetospheres [11,12]. In view of the\nhorizon boundary conditions below, I shall assume that the gap is attached to the\nhorizon.\nTo a first approximation, the local structure of a gap follows from the ingoing\nradiative horizon\u2013boundary conditions. The flow in a gap is described by a chargedensity \u03c1e , a pair-density nw and a Lorentz factor \u0393. This flow is powered by an\nelectric current I along the open field\u2013lines to infinity through a polar cap of area\nAp at the cost of a certain potential drop across. The ingoing radiative boundary\ncondition at the horizon applies to electrons and positrons alike: in the limit as we\napproach the horizon, I and the electric charge density \u03c1e are no longer independent,\nbut become proportional to one another (cf. [20]):\n\n\fLp\nV=0\n\nLS ~ 0\n\nA\u03c6\n\nee+\n\n1\n2\n\nI\n\n(a)\n\nB\n\nI\n\nB\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 1. (a) A classical picture of the potential energy VBL as seen in Boyer-Lindquist\ncoordinates along surfaces of constant magnetic flux A\u03c6 . Note that the axis of rotation\nhas zero potental V = 0 in electrostatic equilibrium q = 2BJ. Hence, VBL = e\u03b2A\u03c6 in the\npresence of frame-dragging \u03b2. Since \u03b2 describes differential rotation in the surrounding\nspace-time, a potential drop emerges along A\u03c6 =const.: \u2206VBL = (\u03b22 \u2212 \u03b21 ) A\u03c6 . When the\npotential drop is steep, a Schwinger-type process generates electron\u2013positron pairs. (b)\nCartoon of the formation of a black\nhole-wind in a black hole-torus system. There is a\np\nminimum opening angle \u03b8min \u223c Bc /3B, beyond which spontaneous emission along open\nfield-lines by the black hole is effective. Flux surfaces with \u03b8 \u223c \u03b8min have a gap length\nof order M , which decreases for \u03b8 > \u03b8min . These gaps, indicated in grey, create pairs,\nwhich are subject to linear acceleration and produce curvature radiation. The net outflow\nLp in particles is a combination of an inner, current-free outflow with vanishingly small\nPoynting flux LS inside \u03b8 < \u03b8min and an outer, current-carrying outflow with \u03b8 > \u03b8min .\nBoth derive most of their particles from pair-cascade through curvature radiation, and\nflow along open field-lines to infinity.\n\n\fI \u2212\u2192 \u2212\u03c1e Ap ,\n\n(3)\n\nsince all particles fall into the black hole with the velocity of light. The sign of \u03c1e\nin (3) is that seen by ZAMOs. Here, \u03c1e (and nw ) are normalized by factoring in the\nredshift factor. I saturates against the horizon surface resistivity of 4\u03c0: 4\u03c0I \u223c \u03bd\u03a9H ,\nup to a logarithmic factor on the left hand-side. Hence, \u03c1e \u223c \u03c1GJ /2, where \u03c1GJ =\nB\u03a9H /2\u03c0\n\u221a is the Goldreich-Julian charge density near the horizon. With curvature\nRB \u223c 2M/\u03b82 of the Wald\u2013field, curvature radiation produces nw >> \u03c1e /e in\n2\nmomentum balance: nw 2e2 \u03934 /3RB\n\u223c \u03c1e E\u22a5 , where E\u22a5 \u223c \u03bd\u03a9H /Me is the equivalent\nelectric field normal to the horizon as seen in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. Note,\nhowever, that the magnetic field of the torus will have larger curvature than that\nof the Wald-field. Given energy balance of the outflow nw \u0393me Acap with the total\npower IE\u22a5 L dissipated in the gap, where L is the linear gap size, the solutions are\ngoverned by the unknown L.\nThe gap size L determines the degree to which the black hole luminosity is put to\nwork in accelerating particles. The gap produces a radiation pressure \u221d L, which\nacts on the interface with the force-free magnetosphere above. The interface is\nprobably Raleigh-Taylor unstable against this radiation pressure. Moreover, the\ngap itself may well widen due to this pressure. The arguments given above are\nintended as a first sketch towards the structure of the gaps, and it appears to be\nof interest to consider the gap size L in the context of a detailed stability analysis.\nA continuous outflow establishes with appropriate current closure. Note that closure over the polar axis introduces Poynting flux with negative helicity, whereas current closure over a gap across the equator of the black hole and the bag of the torus\n(corresponding to the last field-line in pulsar magnetospheres) introduces Poynting\nwith positive helicity - indicative of positive energy and angular momentum transport outwards. As the latter is energetically favorable over the former, thereby\nleaving negligible Poynting flux over the axis of symmetry. A similar conclusion\nhas been found in the case of current closure around neutron stars [11,12]. It follows\nthat the black hole-wind\nis pair-dominated with the property that \u03c3 = LS /Lp \u223c 0\nq\nwithin \u03b8 < \u03b8min = Bc /3B, where LS and Lp are the luminosities in Poynting\nflux and pairs, respectively [26]. Figure 1 (b) sketches this wind\u2013formation process,\nassuming a L to be large on the flux surfaces with \u03b8 \u223c \u03b8min .\nIt will be of interest to look for observational evidence in GRB\u2013afterglow emissions for the presented ultra\u2013relativistic, low density pair-dominated wind.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work is partially supported by NASA Grant 5-7012 and an MIT Reed Award.\nThe author thanks the hospitality of Theoretical Astrophysics, Caltech, and the Korean Institute of Advanced Study (KIAS), where some of this work was performed,\nand gratefully acknowledges stimulating discussions with P.
