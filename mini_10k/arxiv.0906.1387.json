Zaccaria, M. Cristelli, V. Alfi, F. Ciulla, L. Pietronero\nOctober 29, 2018\nAbstract\nWe show that the statistics of spreads in real order books is characterized by an intrinsic asymmetry due to discreteness effects for even or odd\nvalues of the spread. An analysis of data from the NYSE order book points\nout that traders' strategies contribute to this asymmetry. We also investigate this phenomenon in the framework of a microscopic model and, by\nintroducing a non-uniform deposition mechanism for limit orders, we are\nable to quantitatively reproduce the asymmetry found in the experimental\ndata. Simulations of our model also show a realistic dynamics with a sort\nof intermittent behavior characterized by long periods in which the order\nbook is compact and liquid interrupted by volatile configurations. The\norder placement strategies produce a non-trivial behavior of the spread\nrelaxation dynamics which is similar to the one observed in real markets.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe order book is the double auction mechanism [1, 2, 3] which permits to\nprocess and store the orders placed by investors in a modern financial market.\nThis system is the elementary mechanism of price formation as a consequence\nof the arrival of proposals (orders) of buying or selling. There are two classes\nof orders: market orders and limit orders. The market ones correspond to orders to buy/sell at the best available price (called best bid/ask), hence they\nare immediately executed. The limit orders instead are orders to buy or sell at\na given price which can be not necessarily the best one. By consequence limit\norders may not immediately fulfilled and then they are stored in the order book.\nThe difference between the best ask and the best bid is defined as the spread s.\nThe order prices are not continuous but discrete and expressed in units of ticks.\nAlso the volume of an order is an integer multiple of a certain amount of shares.\nThe mid-price between best ask and best bid can be considered a conventional\ndefinition of the price of a stock. The majority of the spread variations are due\nto a limit order which falls inside the spread or to a market order which matches\nall the orders placed at the best price.\nIn recent years the complex dynamics of the order book has attracted the scientific community attention. One of the reasons of this increasing interest is\nthe availability of a large amount of experimental data which has permitted an\n\n1\n\n\fextensive statistical analysis of the order book properties and has revealed a\nnumber of interesting features and regularities. The main empirical evidences\nof the order book are: the fat-tailed distribution of the price of new limit orders [4, 5, 6]; the non-trivial power law correlation of the transaction price\nsigns [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]; the peculiar shape of the limit order volume distribution\nwith fat tails and peaked away from the best quote [4, 5]; the non linear response\nof the order book to order arrivals [12, 13].\nMoreover the microscopic market level of the order book shows the stylized facts\npresent in financial markets at the aggregate level [3, 14, 15, 16]. To interpret\nthese empirical evidences a series of theoretical models has been introduced\n[17, 18, 19, 20, 6, 21]. In particular, the models by Farmer et al. [6, 21] show as\neven a \"zero intelligence\" mechanism can reproduce many of the experimental\nfeatures of real order books.\nIn a previous work we have introduced a model [22] where the zero intelligence\nparadigm is adopted and in this paper we are going to interpret some experimental results in the framework of this model.\nOne of the most challenging issue in this field is the identification of new empirical features in order to discriminate and validate the various models proposed.\nIn this paper we investigate the effects induced by the discrete nature of order\nbooks. In fact, as we have already noticed, the price of the orders is not a continuous variable but it can only be a multiple of a quantity called tick which is a\nfraction of the currency used in the the market considered. A first consequence\nof this aspect is the spontaneous emergence of asymmetries in the system. For\ninstance, two configurations of the order book with an even spread or an odd\none (in units of ticks) are not a priori equivalent for the mechanism of deposition of limit orders inside the spread. We investigate the fraction of odd spreads\nfor a data set from the NYSE market finding indeed a strong evidence for this\nasymmetry. However, as we are going to see in detail in the paper, the problem\nis more subtle than expected and also the agent strategies play an important\nrole to explain quantitatively this phenomenon. The strategic order placement\nis also the origin of the non-trivial relaxation pattern observed when a spread\nfluctuation takes place.\nThe paper is organized in the following way.\nIn Sec. 2 we show the experimental evidence of the asymmetry of spreads.\nIn Sec. 3 we propose an interpretation of this empirical feature in terms of a\nmicroscopic model we introduced in [22].\nIn Sec. 4 we perform a more detailed data analysis in order to investigate further\naspect which contributes to the asymmetry.\nIn Sec. 5 our model is properly modified to take into account the new results\nfound in the data analysis.\nIn Sec. 6 a detailed investigation of the role of the agent strategies for the placement of order inside the spread is performed in the framework of our model.\nIn Sec. 7 we study the effects of strategic order placements on the spread relaxation dynamics with respect to a pure zero-intelligence mechanism.\nFinally conclusions and perspectives are discussed in Sec. 8.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nEmpirical evidences\n\nIn this section we show the empirical evidences that have led us to investigate\nthe asymmetric nature of the order book.\nIn our analysis of the order book we have considered a data set which spans\na period of nearly 80 trading days between October 2004 and February 2005.\nThis data set includes a series of high-frequency (tick-by-tick) information for\n20 stocks from the NYSE market. These stocks have been chosen to be heterogeneous in their level of capitalization 1 . The information we have for each\nstock is the whole list of transactions and quotes, which are the prices of effective deals and of orders respectively. Our data set lacks the information about\nthe whole order book apart of the best bid and the best ask. Therefore a new\nquote appears only if the best bid or the best ask have been updated. From\nthis data set we have reconstructed the sequence of market and limit orders by\nlooking to the spread variations. If the spread has increased with respect to its\nprevious value we refer to the event as a market order. On the contrary, the\nevent is defined as a limit order if the spread has decreased. We assume that\nthe probability that a cancellation of a limit order may change the spread is so\nsmall to be neglected. We have also expressed all the prices in units of ticks,\nso the spread results to be an integer number. At the end of this refinement,\nour data set is composed only by the series of the events in which the spread\nhas changed, each labelled to be a market or a limit order. In this paper we\nrestrict our analysis to limit order events. The complete analysis, including also\nmarket orders, will be matter of future researches. To investigate the intrinsic\nasymmetry that a discrete and finite spread generates, we have firstly analyzed\nhow the fraction of odd spreads depends on the average value of the spread\nfor each stock. In Fig. 1 we have plotted, for each stock, the daily fraction of\nodd-valued spreads as a function of the average value of the spread. There are\n80 different points for each stock and also a further average over all the days\nis plotted in the inset. We can observe that for almost all points the fraction\nof odd-valued spreads is larger than 0.5 which would be the expected value if\nthe spread was very large (s \u2192 \u221e). This asymmetry is more marked for stocks\nwith a smaller average spread and it goes diminishing while the average spread\nincreases. A small average spread usually corresponds to stocks with a large\ncapitalization. In the next sections we are going to investigate these results in\nthe framework of the model we have introduced in a previous work [22].\n\n3\n\nA model for limit order deposition: uniform\ncase\n\nIn this section we propose a simple explanation of the evidences shown in Sec. 2\non the basis of the order book model introduced in [22].\nFirst of all we briefly recall the main properties of the model. At each time\nstep an order is placed. This order can be a sell or a buy order with the same\nprobability 1/2, and a market or a limit order with probability \u03c0 = 1/3 and\n1 \u2212 \u03c0 = 2/3 respectively. A limit order is placed with an uniform distribution\n1 Market\n\ncapitalization is defined as the number of shares of a company multiplied by their\nprice. It is the simplest measure of a company's size.\n\n3\n\n\f1\nfraction of odd spreads\n\nfraction of odd spreads\n\n1\n\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n\n0.9\n\nah\navo\nba\nbro\ncai\ndri\nge\nglk\ngm\njwn\nkss\nmcd\nmhs\nmik\nmls\npg\ntxi\nudi\nvno\nwgr\n\naverage\n\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n\n2\n\n4\n\n8 10 12\n6\n<spread> (ticks)\n\n14\n\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n10 12\n<spread> (ticks)\n\n14\n\n16\n\nFigure 1: (Color online) Fraction of odd-valued spreads (in units of ticks) vs\ndaily average spread for different stocks. We observe a systematic deviation\nfrom the symmetric case in which the fraction is 0.5. In the inset we plot a\nfurther average over a period of 80 days.\n\nin the interval ]b(t), b(t) + ks(t)] if it is a sell order and [a(t) \u2212 ks(t), a(t)[ if it is\na buy order, where b(t) and a(t) are the best bid and the best ask respectively,\ns(t) is the spread and k > 1 is a constant. In first approximation k \u22121 is the\nprobability for a limit order to be put inside the spread (therefore causing a\nprice change). This dependence on the previous spread value creates a sort\nof autoregressive mechanism for the order deposition. The tick size and the\nvolume of the orders are both constant and fixed (\u2206q = 1 and \u03c9 = 1). Finally,\na cancellation process avoids the divergence of the volume stored in the order\nbook.\nIn this framework we can evaluate a number of quantities, for example the\nprobability that, given a spread s at time t, the new spread s\u2032 6= s at time\nt + \u2206t is even or odd, where \u2206t is the time to wait to have a variation of the\nspread. The dependence on the parameter k is removed because we consider\nonly the conditioned probability that an event occurs. In this paper we indicate\nwith s the value of the spread before an incoming event and with s\u2032 the new value\nof the spread consequent to the variation. Here we restrict our analysis only to\nevents due to limit order arrival. The probability to have an odd spread in the\nfinal state turns to be dependent on the parity of the spread s. Straightforward\ncalculations give the probabilities\nP (e|o, s) =\n\n1\n2\n\nP (o|e, s) =\n\n1 s\n2 s\u22121\n\nP (o|o, s) =\n\n1\n2\n\nP (e|e, s) =\n\n1 s\u22122\n2 (s\u22121) .\n\n(1)\n\nwhere o and e denote if the the spread is odd or even respectively. One can\nsee that P (o|e) > P (e|e): given an even spread s in the initial state, the next\nspread s\u2032 has a larger probability to be odd rather than even. As expected, both\nP (o|e) and P (e|e) tend to 1/2 for s \u2192 \u221e. This simple argument gives a first\nexplanation of the empirical evidence of an excess of odd spreads shown in the\n4\n\n\f1\n\nP ( odd | spread )\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8 10 12 14\nspread (ticks)\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\nFigure 2: (Color online) Conditional probability to have an odd-valued spread\ns\u2032 given an initial spread s for real data. The plot shows clearly that with high\nprobability an odd spread is followed by an even one (0.8) and vice-versa.\n\nprevious section.\n\n4\n\nData analysis\n\nNow we intend to give an interpretation of Fig. 1 in view of the results obtained\nin the previous section. The dispersion of the points plotted in Fig. 1 can be\ntraced back to the spurious effect introduced by the fact that many different\nspreads s give their contribution to the final average. Therefore the next step\nis to investigate the frequency of odd spreads conditioned to a given s, in order\nto compare Eq. 1 to real data.\nWe can identify the variations of the spread caused by limit orders imposing\nthe condition s > s\u2032 because only limit orders inside the spread can decrease\nits value (the same argument has been also followed, for example, by [23]). In\nFig. 2 we show the conditional probability to have an odd spread s\u2032 starting\nfrom a spread s, as a function of s. The pattern strongly oscillates around the\nvalue 1/2: an even spread is most likely followed by an odd one as predicted by\nEq. 1, but surprisingly also the viceversa is true.\nThis apparently strange (with respect to the result of Eq. 1) behavior can be\nattributed to a non-uniform depositions of limit orders inside the spread. We\nstudied the distribution of the spread variations conditioned to a given value\nof the spread s for real data. We found that a consistent fraction \u03b1 \u223c 0.7 of\nthe limit orders inside the spread is placed at the quote adjacent to the best,\nas we show in Fig. 3. A reasonable way to model this non-uniform distribution\nof the limit orders inside the spread is through a piecewise constant function.\nIn this way the probability to put a limit order at the first adjacent quote is\n\u03b1, and the probability to put the order in one of the other remaining quotes is\nequally distributed. This tendency can be also interpreted in terms of agents'\nstrategies. In fact, the placement an order far from the (previous) best bid or\n\n5\n\n\f0.8\n\n1\n\nP(\u2206s|s)\n\nP(\u2206s|s)\n\n0.6\n\ns s=4\n=4\ns s=6\n=6\ns s=8\n=8\ns s=10\n= 10\ns s=12\n= 12\n\n0.1\n\n0.4\n0.01\n1\n\n\u2206 s (ticks)\n\n0.2\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5 6 7\n\u2206 s (ticks)\n\n8\n\n10\n\n9 10 11 12\n\nFigure 3: (Color online) Probability to have a variation \u2206s of the spread given an\ninitial s for different spread values (empirical data). The most probable variation\nis always \u2206s = 1. The probabilities of the other variations (\u2206s = 2, 3, ...) are\nweakly decreasing functions and, in first approximation, can be considered as\nconstant. The dashed line is the power law with exponent 1.8 found in [24] for\nLondon Stock Exhange. In both cases \u2206s = 1 is highly preferred.\n\nask can be seen as a risky operation in which the agent, by disagreeing with\nother agents' evaluations, tries to trade quickly paying a kind of virtual cost\nequal to the distance between the best and her order quote. In other words, an\norder near the best is the most conservative position able to change the spread.\nThe next step is to find how much the probability \u03b1 to place a limit order near\nthe corresponding best depends on the spread s and on the stock considered. In\nFig. 4 we plot \u03b1 as a function of s for three stocks which cover a wide range of\ncapitalization, finding very different behaviors depending on the stocks and on\nthe values of the spreads. One possible explaination for this variety of behaviors\nis the lack of statistics: in fact, liquid stocks (that is, stocks characterized by\nfast order execution and small transaction impact on the price) usually have\nsmall spreads, and hence the statistics for large spreads is poor, and viceversa\nfor illiquid stocks. We can appropriately weight the contribution of different\nstocks by averaging on all the data. The resulting curve is approximately a\nconstant as a function of the spread.\n\n5\n\nA model for limit order deposition:\nnon-uniform case\n\nIn the previous section we have observed a systematic deviation of the experimental probabilities P (o|e, s) and P (e|o, s) from the ones of Eq. 1 derived from\nthe hypothesis of uniform order deposition. In this section we are going to show\nthat this discrepancy is mainly due to the non-uniform probability of order\nplacement inside the spread, and therefore to agents' strategies.\nIn order to include the effect of a non-uniform order deposition, we can gener6\n\n\f1\n\n\u03b1 (s)\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\nbro\nge\ntxi\naverage\n\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10 12\ns (ticks)\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\nFigure 4: (Color online) Probability \u03b1(s) to place an order at the quote adjacent\nto the best one as a function of the spread. We have plotted this probabilities for\nthree representative stocks and also an average over all the 20 stocks. The very\ndifferent values observed can be explained by considering the different statistics\nof the stocks. To properly address this effect we have performed an average\nover the 20 stocks of our data set. The result is a value of \u03b1(s) approximately\nconstant.\n\nalize Eq. 1 in the following way\nP (e|o, s) =\n\nP s\u22121\n2\n\nP (o|o, s) =\n\nP s\u22123\n2\n\nj=1\n\nj=0\n\ng(2j|s)\ng(2j + 1|s)\n\nP (o|e, s) =\n\nP s\u22122\n2\n\ng(2j + 1|s)\n\nP (e|e, s) =\n\nP s\u22122\n2\n\ng(2j|s).\n\nj=0\n\nj=1\n\n(2)\n\nwhere g(i|s) is the probability mass function of the deposition mechanism for\nlimit orders inside the spread and i = 1, . . . , s \u2212 1 is the distance from the best\nquote of the placement price.\nIn Fig. 4 we have seen that the probability \u03b1 that a limit order produces a\nspread variation equal to one is weakly dependent on the value of the spread.\nThis suggests a simple approximation for g(i|s) with a piecewise function. Now\nwe discuss how to introduce this property in our model.\nIf a limit order falls inside the book or at the best quotes the mechanism for\norder deposition is left unchanged. Instead, if a limit order is placed inside\nthe spread, the probabilities associated to the s \u2212 1 available quotes are no\nmore uniform but highly peaked around the quote adjacent to the best. The\ndeposition probabilities for a buy or a sell order, for a given s, become\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 g(1|s) = \u03b1\n(3)\ng(i|s) =\n\uf8f3\ni\n=\n2,\n...,\ns\n\u2212\n1.\ng(i|s) = 1\u2212\u03b1\ns\u22122\nFor buy orders the index i is the distance from the best bid while for sell orders\nthe index i is the distance from the best ask. In the previous section we have\nseen that in real markets \u03b1 can be approximately considered as constant and\n7\n\n\fits value is about 0.7. Clearly Eq. 3 is meaningful only for s \u2265 3 since for s = 1\nlimit orders cannot fall inside the spread and for s = 2 a limit order inside the\nspread is always placed at the quote adjacent to the best one.\nIt follows directly from Eq. 3 that the transition probabilities now read\nP (e|o, s) = \u03b1 +\nP (o|o, s) =\n\n1\u2212\u03b1 s\u22123\n2 s\u22122\n\n1\u2212\u03b1 s\u22121\n2 s\u22122\n\nP (o|e, s) = \u03b1 +\nP (e|e, s) =\n\n1\u2212\u03b1\n2\n\n(4)\n\n1\u2212\u03b1\n2 .\n\nIn Fig. 5 we plot a comparison between the expression of Eq. 4 and the\ncorresponding probabilities evaluated from our data set. The experimental results are obtained by averaging over all the 80 trading days and over all the 20\nstocks. The oscillating behavior can be explained by considering that a variation of spread of one tick (\u2206s = 1) is highly preferred with respect to other\nvariations. Hence an odd spread goes more likely to an even one and vice-versa.\nWe are now able to separate the two effects that contribute to enhance the frac-\n\n1\n\nP ( odd | spread )\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\nmodel\nexperimental\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8 10 12 14\nspread (ticks)\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\nFigure 5: (Color online) Comparison between the experimental data and the\nphenomenological model described in the text. The phenomenological probabilities of the model (dots) show a small systematic overestimation of the oscillations with respect to the experimental ones (triangles). This effect can be\neasily understood in terms of the approximation considered in Eq. 3.\ntion of odd spreads and produce the pattern of Fig. 1 through a simple Monte\nCarlo simulation. These two contributions are the intrinsic asymmetry due to\ndiscreteness and non-uniformity of order deposition. As initial conditions we\ngenerate some sequences of spreads with different means, in order to represent\ndifferent virtual stocks. Starting from each sequence we simulate the transition\nto odd or even spreads s\u2032 according to the probabilities of Eq. 1 and Eq. 4. In\nsuch a way we can evaluate the average fraction of odd spreads for each virtual\nstock. In Fig. 6 we compare the empirical average asymmetry with the results\nof the Monte Carlo simulations in the two cases just mentioned. The intrinsic\nasymmetry alone is not able to fit properly the experimental data which instead\n8\n\n\fare well reproduced by considering the two combined effects. Nevertheless we\ncan observe some deviations for large spreads (> 6). This is due to the fact that\nwe have assumed a constant probability to place order at quotes different from\nthe one adjacent to the best. When the spread grows the error introduced by\nthis assumption becomes larger. It is worth noticing that here we are neglecting\n\nfraction of odd spreads\n\n1\naverage (NYSE data)\nuniform - Eq.

The first simulation (squares) is performed using the uniform order deposition mechanism.\nThe second one (crosses) is instead performed with the non uniform mechanism.\nThese two simulations permit to investigate the two contributions to the asymmetry between odd and even spreads. As expected we observe that the intrinsic\nasymmetry does not reproduce the experimental pattern (dots) while the two\ncombined effects fit the experimental data very well. The small discrepancy\nfound for large spreads is originated by the approximation made in Eq. 3.\nthe correlations between the spread values. Anyway we can recover the experimental behavior even with this uncorrelated sequence since we are averaging on\ntimes far longer than the time scales of the spread correlation.\n\n6\n\nThe effects of the strategic deposition of orders\n\nAn interesting question concerns the role of the parameter \u03b1 and how the nonuniform deposition inside the spread affects the order book statistical properties.\nOur model allows this kind of investigation and permits to study the effect of\ndifferent strategies of order placement inside the spread.\nA numerical simulation reveals that if the same set of parameters of Sec. 3 and\nof [22] is used, the spread dynamics diverges for \u03b1 > 0.85. To explain this effect\nwe have to consider the interplay between market and limit orders. Market\norders tend to move away the two best quotes eroding the book. Instead limit\norders tend to reduce the spread by coupling the processes followed by best ask\nand best bid. In such a way the process for the spread is somehow stationary.\n9\n\n\fIn this framework the deposition rules play an important role in softening or\nstrengthening the coupling action of limit orders. In fact the coupling between\na(t) and b(t) is ruled by two elements. The first one is the fraction of orders\nwhich fall inside the spread. A larger fraction of these orders produces a stronger\ncoupling between the best quotes. The second is the mechanism of deposition of\norders inside the spread, which governs the average spread variation produced\nby a limit order. In order to analyze the effect of the deposition mechanism we\ncan reason as it follows. By considering the symmetry of the uniform case, we\nfind\n1\n< \u2206s >\n=\n(5)\ns\n2\nwhile in the non-uniform case, from Eq. 4, we obtain\n\u03b1 (1 \u2212 \u03b1)[s(s \u2212 1) \u2212 2]\n< \u2206s >\n= +\n.\ns\ns\n2s(s \u2212 2)\n\n(6)\n\nWe recall that s \u2265 3 since for s = 1 limit orders cannot be placed inside the\nspread and for s = 2 we always have \u2206s/s = 1/2. The inequality < \u2206s > /s \u2265\n1/2 for Eq. 6 is satisfied when\n2\u2264s\u2264\n\n\u03b1+1\n\u03b1\n\n(7)\n\nand we observe that (\u03b1 + 1)/\u03b1 > 3 only for \u03b1 < 0.5 (see Fig. 7). Consequently\nthe average spread variation and the coupling action of limit orders in the nonuniform case are never larger than the one produced by the uniform mechanism\nin the region of parameters investigated (s \u2265 3 and \u03b1 > 0.5).\nFixed \u03b1 \u2264 0.8 we can analyze the properties of our model and we will come back\non the problem of the stability with respect to \u03b1 at the end of this section. The\nset of figures in Fig. 8 clarifies the role of a non-uniform deposition inside the\nspread. In Fig. 8a and Fig. 8b we have plotted the probability density functions\nfor the price variations (returns) and for the spreads respectively. We observe\nthat in the non-uniform case the system produces larger fluctuations and larger\naverage spreads, as we expected from the previous discussion. It is interesting\nto notice that when the system tends to a regime in which the order book is\nalways compact, i.e. in which most of the quotes inside the book are occupied,\nthe statistical properties becomes nearly independent on the deposition details\n(\u03c0 \u2264 0.25).\nFig. 8c reveals that the non-uniform deposition also amplifies the fluctuations\nof the granularity g, defined as the linear density of the volume stored in a\nside of the order book [22]. In particular the non-uniform deposition shows a\nnon-trivial temporal structure for granularity that resembles an intermittency\nphenomenon. Since most of the arriving limit orders are placed adjacent to\nthe best quote the order book stays for long times in a quiet and compact\nstate characterized by an average spread whose value is nearly one. This is\nthe dominant regime of our simulated order book, but sometimes bursts of\nvolatility are observed. In fact, when a large fluctuation of spread occurs, the\nautoregressive property and the non-uniformity of the limit order deposition\nmake the relaxation towards the compact state very slow. This intermittency\nis directly related to the volatility correlation that is far longer in the nonuniform case than in the uniform one (see Fig. 8d). We want to stress that a\n10\n\n\f8\ns=2\ns=(\u03b1+1)/\u03b1\n\n7\n\nspread\n\n6\n\n<\u2206s>/s < 0.5\n\n5\n4\n3\n\n<\u2206\n\ns>/\n\ns>\n\n0.5\n\n2\n1\n0\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9\n\u03b1\n\n1\n\nFigure 7: Phase diagram of the relative average spread variation for the nonuniform mechanism. The relative average spread variation < \u2206s > /s is 0.5\nfor the uniform case. < \u2206s > /s is larger than 0.5 only for spreads included\nin the region between s = 2 and s = (\u03b1 + 1)/\u03b1. The highlighted region (s \u2265 3\nand \u03b1 > 0.5) corresponds to a realistic scenario. We see that in this region\nthe relative average variation of the spread produced by a limit order is always\nsmaller than 0.5. Therefore the non-uniform deposition reduces the coupling\naction of limit orders with respect to the uniform case.\n\nsmall volatility clustering is already present in the uniform case. Its origin can\nbe traced back to the dependence on the past spread values of the deposition\nmechanism. This simple effect introduces an exponential correlation and so\nfixes a characteristic time-scale. The non-uniform deposition instead amplifies\nthis effect because the mechanism sets a further and longer time-scale that\ndepends on \u03b1 (the correlation length increases for increasing values of \u03b1). The\ncorrelation functions in Fig. 8d obey to an exponential decay except for short\ntime lags where some spurious effects take place. The bursts of volatility of\nthe non-uniform case are even more evident if we represent the complete order\nbook. In Fig. 9, that corresponds to the uniform case, the order book is always\ncompact. Instead in Fig. 10 we plot the non-uniform case and we find that the\nsystem stays for most of the time in a regime which is very similar to the one\nof Fig. 9 (regions I,III,V) but sometimes regions characterized by large spreads\nand large price movements appear (regions II,IV,VI). It is worth noticing that\nin this model large price fluctuations emerge spontaneously, being triggered by\na random spread variation (and vice-versa). This mechanism resembles the\nphenomenon of self-organized criticality [25, 26].\nIt can be argued that also for larger values of \u03c0 the uniform case could produce\nthis intermittency because this correspond to an increase of the time-scale on\nwhich the autoregressive mechanism is able to produce local volatility clustering\nas we can observe in Fig. 8d. Nevertheless the correlation is still far shorter\nwhen \u03c0 = 0.33 with respect to the one generated by the non-uniform case with\n\u03c0 = 0.3. Furthermore the magnitude of the correlation is smaller than the one\nof the non-uniform case with lower values of \u03c0.

In panels a) and b) we plot the probability\ndensity functions for the returns (\u2206p) and spreads respectively for different\nmarket order rates (\u03c0). These plots show that the average fluctuations of spreads\nand returns are larger in the non-uniform case. When the order book turns to\na compact regime (\u03c0 \u2264 0.25), the statistical properties of the model become\nnearly independent on the deposition details. Panel c) reveals that the nonuniform deposition produces non-trivial fluctuations of liquidity/granularity. In\npanel d) we plot the autocorrelation of the absolute values of returns and we\nobserve the presence of persistent volatility. The decay of the autocorrelation\nfunction of the absolute values of returns is exponential except for short time\nlags where spurious effects take place. This persistent behavior suggests the\npresence of an intermittent dynamics for the order book characterized by bursts\nof volatility.\n\n12\n\n\forder book reveals that an intermittency of a kind appears but it is very small\nand we never obtain an order book with sudden transitions from a compact\nregime to a volatile regime as it happens in region II of Fig. 10.\n\nFigure 9: (Color online) Snapshot of the simulated order book in the uniform\ncase (\u03c0 = 0.3). The order book is always in a compact regime in which the average spread is nearly 1 and a small and local volatility clustering is observed due\nto the autoregressive deposition rules. For higher values of \u03c0 small deviations\nfrom the compact regime appear but these phenomena cannot be compared to\nthe intermittency produced when the order deposition is non-uniform.\n\nNow we discuss the stability of the model for \u03b1 \u2265 0.8. We have seen in Figs.\n8 a,b that, in order to make the system stable with respect to \u03b1, a possible\nsolution is the reduction of the probability of market orders \u03c0. In such a way it\nis possible to increase the average length of limit order sequences and then to\ncompensate the lower coupling. However increasing values of \u03b1 (> 0.8) would\nimply a choice for \u03c0 \u2248 0.25 (or even smaller) and in this region of parameters\nthe order book is always compact and all volatility bursts disappear. However\nit is worth noticing that these ranges of parameters are usually not observed in\nempirical data.\n\n7\n\nSpread relaxation: role of the strategic order\nplacement.\n\nPonzi et al. in [24] studied the relaxation dynamics after an opening or a closing\nof the spread in LSE 2 order book. They find a slow relaxation of the spread\ntowards the mean value. This decay is compatible with a power law and the\nauthors argue that the absence of a characteristic time scale is due to the presence of a strategic placement of the orders.\n2 London\n\nStock Exchange\n\n13\n\n\fFigure 10: (Color online) Snapshot of the simulated order book in the nonuniform case (\u03c0 = 0.3 and \u03b1 = 0.7). These deposition rules produce an order\nbook which is typically quiet and compact as in the uniform case (region I, III,\nV) but exhibits bursts of activity due to large fluctuations of the spread (region\nII, IV, VI). The system gives rise to a sort of intermittency since volatility is\nvery persistent and clustered.\n\nWe want to verify this empirical findings in the framework of the model introduced in the previous sections. In this respect we define, as in [24], the quantity\nG(\u03c4 |\u2206) = E[s(t + \u03c4 )|s(t) \u2212 s(t \u2212 1) = \u2206] \u2212 E[s(t)]\n\n(8)\n\nwhere E[*] is the average on the whole time serie, \u2206 is the spread variation\noccured at time t (i.e. \u03c4 = 0) and \u03c4 \u2265 0. It is worth noticing that, in our\nmodel, \u03c4 is expressed in time event units differently from the analysis in [24]\nwhich is performed in physical time. The mapping between these two time units\nis not necessarily linear and therefore a quantitative agreement should not be\nalways expected.\nWe perform the spread relaxation analysis in both the uniform case and nonuniform case and we report the results in Fig. 11. The non-uniform mechanism\nproduces a plateau of a kind and then for \u03c4 > 100 a faster decay to normal\nspread values. Instead in the uniform case the spread relaxation is much faster\nthan the previous case. Now we analyze in detail the non-uniform case. In\nFig. 12 we report the function G(\u03c4 |\u2206) for positive and negative values of \u2206\n(corresponding respectively to openings and closings of the spread at time \u03c4 =\n0). As in [24], we observe two slightly different patterns for negative and positive\n\u2206. Instead, we do not observe such a difference in the uniform case, this means\nthe nature of the relaxation dynamics is completely different for these two cases.\nWe can conclude that, in order to obtain a realistic spread relaxation function,\na simple change to a pure zero-intelligence model consists in the non-uniform\nmechanism of limit orders deposition inside the spread described in section 5.\n\n14\n\n\fG(\u03c4|\u2206) (ticks)\n\n\u2206=4\n\u2206=2\n\u2206=4\n\u2206=2\n\n10\n\nunif\nunif\n\u03b1=0.7\n\u03b1=0.7\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n10\n10\ntime (event time)\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\nFigure 11: (Color online) Spread decay given \u2206 in the uniform case (solid lines)\nand in the non-uniform case (dashed lines).

We have investigated which are the effects of this discreteness finding non-trivial aspects and\ndeviations with respect to a continuous regime.\nThe starting point of this work has been the observation that odd and even\nspreads are not equivalent for limit order deposition when the available quotes\ninside the spread are discrete. In fact, if a uniform deposition of orders inside\nthe spread is assumed, the system spontaneously prefers odd spreads.\nOne of results of this paper confirms that this asymmetry is present in real order\nbooks and that the fraction of odd spreads is significantly above 0.5. However\nthe asymmetry observed cannot be explained quantitatively only by considering the discrete nature of the order book. Indeed we have found that a second\neffect also contributes to modulate the asymmetry, the fact that agents prefer\nthe quote adjacent to the best one when they place orders inside the spread.\nBoth these contributions have been investigated in the framework of a microscopic model introduced in a previous work [22]. The model permits to compare\nthe effects of uniform and non-uniform deposition mechanisms for limit orders\ninside the spread. We have found that the asymmetry can be quantitatively\nreproduced in the framework of our model by introducing a non-uniform deposition mechanism.\nAnother result is the emergence of a sort of intermittent dynamics in which a\nregime characterized by a compact and liquid order book dominates but bursts\nof volatility also appear. This intermittent behavior is also observed in real\norder books. In this respect, in the framework of our model, we compare the\nuniform and the non-uniform mechanism for order deposition with respect to\nthe dynamics of the spread relaxation when a fluctuation occurs. We find that\nthe introduction of a simple rule of order placement is sufficient to reproduce\n\n15\n\n\fG(\u03c4|\u2206) (ticks)\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u2206=10\n\u2206=9\n\u2206=8\n\u2206=7\n\u2206=6\n\u2206=5\n\u2206=4\n\u2206=3\n\u2206=2\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n10\n\nG(\u03c4|\u2206) (ticks)\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u2206=\u221210\n\u2206=\u22129\n\u2206=\u22128\n\u2206=\u22127\n\u2206=\u22126\n\u2206=\u22125\n\u2206=\u22124\n\u2206=\u22123\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n10\ntime (event time)\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n10\ntime (event time)\n\n10\n\n3\n\nFigure 12: (Color online) Spread decay in the non-uniform case for positive\n(top panel) and negative (bottom panel) values of \u2206.
