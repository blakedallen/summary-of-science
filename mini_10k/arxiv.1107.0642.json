No evidence for these decays has been found. Assuming\nuniform three-body phase space distributions for the D\u2212 l+ l\u2032+ decays, we set the following upper\nlimits on the branching fractions at 90% confidence level: B(B + \u2192 D\u2212 e+ e+ ) < 2.6\u00d710\u22126 , B(B + \u2192\nD\u2212 e+ \u03bc+ ) < 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22126 and B(B + \u2192 D\u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bc+ ) < 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 .\nPACS numbers: 11.30.Er, 13.25.Hw, 14.40.Nd\n\nIn the Standard Model (SM) neutrinos are left-handed\nmassless particles and lepton number is conserved. However, the strong evidence for neutrino oscillations [1] indicates that neutrinos do have non-zero masses. An important question then arises regarding the origin of neutrino\nmasses: whether they are of Dirac or Majorana type. If\nneutrinos are purely of Dirac type, they must have righthanded singlet components in addition to the left-handed\nstates required in order to accommodate neutrino masses.\nIn this case, lepton number is conserved. On the other\nhand, if there are Majorana-type neutrino states, a neutrino cannot be distinguished from its own antiparticle.\nAs a result, lepton-number-violating processes can occur\nin which lepton number changes by two units (\u2206L = 2).\nThere have been many experimental attempts to\nsearch for \u2206L = 2 processes. The most thoroughly tested\nof these processes are neutrinoless nuclear double beta\ndecays (0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2) [2]. While the experiments are very sensitive, uncertainties in the nuclear matrix elements for\n0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 would make it difficult to extract the mass scale\nof the neutrinos involved in such decays. As an alternative, several authors have considered \u2206L = 2 processes\nin meson decays [3\u20135].\nThe only existing experimental result for \u2206L = 2 B\n\nmeson decays is that of the CLEO collaboration, which\nsearched for B + \u2192 h\u2212 l+ l\u2032+ [6], where h stands for \u03c0, K,\n\u03c1, or K \u2217 and l stands for e or \u03bc. They set upper limits\non branching fractions for these decays in the range of\n(1.0 \u2212 8.3) \u00d7 10\u22126 at 90% confidence level (CL) [7]. Since\nb \u2192 c decays are in general favored in comparison to\ncharmless B decays, it is interesting to extend the search\nto B + \u2192 D\u2212 l+ l\u2032+ decays. Two well-known diagrams for\nsuch decays are shown in Fig. 1 (a) and (b). According to\ntheoretical calculations, with a heavy Majorana neutrino\nof mass within the (2 \u2212 4) GeV/c2 range, the branching\nfractions of B + \u2192 D\u2212 l+ l\u2032+ can be larger than 10\u22127 [4,\n5] with the diagram in Fig. 1 (b) giving the dominant\ncontribution.\nIn this paper, we report the first searches for the\nB + \u2192 D\u2212 e+ e+ , D\u2212 e+ \u03bc+ and D\u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bc+ decays. The\nresults are based on a data sample containing 772 \u00d7 106\nB B\u0304 pairs collected at the \u03a5(4S) resonance with the Belle\ndetector at the KEKB [8] asymmetric-energy e+ e\u2212 collider (3.5 on 8 GeV). The Belle detector is a large-solidangle magnetic spectrometer consisting of a silicon vertex detector, a 50-layer central drift chamber (CDC), an\narray of aerogel threshold Cherenkov counters (ACC),\na time-of-flight scintillation counter (TOF), and an ar-\n\n\f3\nray of CsI(Tl) crystals for an electromagnetic calorimeter\n(ECL) located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that\nprovides a 1.5 T magnetic field. An iron flux-return located outside the solenoid is equipped with resistive plate\nchambers to identify muons as well as KL0 mesons (KLM).\nThe Belle detector is described in detail elsewhere [9].\nThe analysis procedure is established using Monte\nCarlo (MC) simulations [10], as well as data control samples wherever possible. Since we have no prior knowledge nor widely-accepted model for the decay dynamics\nof B + \u2192 D\u2212 l+ l\u2032+ , the signal MC samples are generated\nuniformly over the three-body phase space, and we restrict our analysis and interpretation to this model only.\nTo reconstruct B + \u2192 D\u2212 l+ l\u2032+ decays, we first look\nfor an energetic same-sign dilepton and combine it with\na D candidate requiring a proper charge combination for\nthe dilepton. All charged tracks are required to originate\nnear the interaction point and have impact parameters\nwithin 5 cm along the beam direction and within 1 cm\nin the transverse plane to the beam direction.\nElectrons are identified using the energy and shower\nprofile in the ECL, the light yield in the ACC (Np.e. ) and\nthe specific ionization energy loss in the CDC (dE/dx).\nThis information is used to form an electron (Le ) and\nnon-electron (Le ) likelihood. The likelihoods are utilized\nin the form of a likelihood ratio Re = Le /(Le + Le )\n[11]. Applying a requirement on Re , we select electrons with an efficiency and a misidentification rate of\napproximately 90% and 0.1%, respectively, in the kinematic region of interest. Muons are distinguished from\nother charged tracks by their ranges and their hit profiles\nin the KLM. This information is utilized in a likelihood\nratio approach [12] similar to the one used for the electron identification (ID). We select muons with an efficiency and a misidentification rate of approximately 90%\nand 1%, respectively, in the kinematic region of interest. The efficiencies for electron (muon) ID are evaluated\nfrom data using the e+ e\u2212 (\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) pair production via the\ntwo-photon reaction \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 (\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ). Since the lepton ID performance is worse for lower-momentum tracks,\nwe require the lepton momentum in the laboratory frame\nto be greater than 0.5 GeV/c and 0.8 GeV/c for electrons\nand muons, respectively.\nWe require a same-sign lepton pair that has a total\nenergy in the \u03a5(4S) center-of-mass (CM) frame greater\nthan 1.3 GeV. More than 95% of events have only one\nsame-sign lepton pair. When there is more than one\nsame-sign lepton pair, we choose the most energetic\nsame-sign lepton pair from the three most energetic leptons in the event.\nCandidate D\u2212 mesons are reconstructed in the D\u2212 \u2192\n+ \u2212 \u2212\nK \u03c0 \u03c0 decay. Kaons and pions are selected from\ncharged particles by applying hadron ID [13]. The\nhadron ID utilizes the time of flight measured in the\nTOF as well as Np.e. and dE/dx in a likelihood ratio\napproach, which is similar to that used for lepton ID.\n\nWe discriminate kaons (pions) from pions (kaons) with\nan efficiency of approximately 91% (95%) and a misidentification rate below 4% (6%) in the kinematic region of\ninterest. The rates are evaluated from data using kinematically reconstructed D\u2217+ \u2192 D0 \u03c0 + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + decays. The three tracks from the D\u2212 candidate are fit to a\ncommon vertex and are required to have a K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass (MK\u03c0\u03c0 ) within approximately \u00b110 MeV/c2\nfrom the nominal D\u2212 mass [14]. The MK\u03c0\u03c0 distribution\nis fit to two Gaussian functions with a common mean.\nThe MK\u03c0\u03c0 mass window is chosen to be \u00b13 times the\nwidth of the narrower Gaussian component. The average multiplicity of D\u2212 candidates is 1.3 per event. If\nthere are multiple D\u2212 candidates, we choose the one with\nMK\u03c0\u03c0 closest to the nominal D mass.\nThe same-sign dilepton and the D\u2212 candidates are\ncombined to form a B candidate, and are fit to a common vertex. The B candidates are kinematically identified using two variables: the energy difference, \u2206E \u2261\nEB \u2212 Ebeam , p\nand the beam-energy-constrained B meson\n2\n\u2212 p2B . Here, Ebeam is the beam enmass, Mbc \u2261 Ebeam\nergy and EB and pB are the energy and momentum, respectively, of a B candidate; these variables are defined in\nthe CM frame. We select events with Mbc > 5.2 GeV/c2\nand |\u2206E| < 0.3 GeV (\"analysis region\"). The signal region is defined as 5.27 GeV/c2 < Mbc < 5.29 GeV/c2 and\n\u22120.055 (\u22120.035) GeV < \u2206E < 0.035 GeV for the e+ e+\nand e+ \u03bc+ modes (\u03bc+ \u03bc+ mode), respectively. For background studies, we use a subset of the analysis region\nthat excludes the signal region (\"background region\").\nOne of the major backgrounds comes from the continuum production of quark pairs e+ e\u2212 \u2192 q q\u0304 (q = u, d, s\nand c). The continuum background is discriminated from\nthe signal by utilizing the difference of the event shapes\nin the CM frame. Since B mesons are produced from the\n\u03a5(4S) resonance nearly at rest in the CM frame their\nfinal state particles are distributed isotropically. In the\ncontinuum, on the other hand, q q\u0304 pairs hadronize backto-back and give rise to a two-jet-like shape. To quantify\nthe event shape characteristics, we use Fox-Wolfram moments [15] with modifications optimized for exclusive B\ndecays [16]. A single discrimination variable, F , is obtained by applying a linear Fisher discriminant [17] to the\nmoments and maximizing their discrimination power.\nIn addition to F , we also use the cosine of the polar\nangle of the B candidate flight direction evaluated in the\nCM frame (cos \u03b8B ). Since the \u03a5(4S) is a vector particle\nthat decays to a pair of spinless B mesons, the cos \u03b8B distribution of the B mesons follows a |Y11 |2 \u221d 1 \u2212 cos2 \u03b8B\ndistribution, while random track combinations in the\ncontinuum have a nearly uniform distribution.\nThe other major background comes from semileptonic\nB decays such as B \u2192 D\u2212 l+ \u03bdl X with D\u2212 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 ,\nwhere X denotes any particle. Such decays can be misreconstructed as signal by combining a same-sign lepton from the decay products of the other B. In such\n\n\f4\nbackground events, each lepton is produced along with\na neutrino, resulting in large missing energy, while the\nsignal tends to have small missing energy because there\nare no neutrinos in the final state. Here the P\nmissing\nenergy,PEmiss , is defined as Emiss \u2261 2Ebeam \u2212\nEdet ,\nwhere\nEdet denotes the sum of energies of all the detected particles in the event. Moreover, the same-sign\nleptons in such background events originate from different B mesons. As a result, the difference between the\nimpact parameters of the two leptons in the beam direction, \u03b4z, tends to be larger in such background events\nthan in the signal. Therefore, we use Emiss and \u03b4z as\nvariables to suppress these backgrounds.\nThe four variables, F , cos \u03b8B , Emiss and \u03b4z, are\ncombined together into a single likelihood ratio Rs =\nLs /(Ls + Lb ), where Ls(b) denotes the signal (background) likelihood defined as the product of the signal\n(background) probability densities for each of the four\nvariables. The two major backgrounds can be suppressed\nby applying a requirement on Rs . The probability density functions (PDFs) are taken from the distributions in\nthe MC samples. The background sample includes continuum and B B\u0304 components, where B decays are limited\nto b \u2192 c decays. The optimal requirement on\u221a\nRs is determined by maximizing the figure of merit, \u01ebs / Nb , where\n\u01ebs is the signal efficiency estimated with the signal MC\nsample, and Nb is the number of expected background\nevents in the signal region. Since only a small number\nof events remain in the signal region after the Rs requirement, the value of Nb is obtained by scaling the\nnumber of events in the analysis region using the background MC sample, where the scale factor is determined\nfrom the same MC sample but without the Rs requirement. The optimal requirements on Rs eliminate more\nthan 99% of the background while retaining 11-26% of\nthe signal depending on the mode.\nIn addition to the two dominant backgrounds described above, we checked backgrounds that might produce a signal-like enhancement in the Mbc -\u2206E distribution having more than one particle misidentified.\nPossible peaking backgrounds include B + \u2192 J/\u03c8(\u2192\nl+ l\u2212 )K + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , with the l\u2212 and \u03c0 + misidentified as a \u03c0 \u2212\nand l+ , respectively. Contributions from these decays are\ninvestigated using the MC sample that is approximately\nequivalent to 50 times the luminosity of the data sample. The contribution of B + \u2192 D\u2212 h+ h\u2032+ decays with\nboth same-sign hadrons (h(\u2032) ) misidentified as leptons is\nestimated from the number of B + \u2192 D\u2212 h+ h\u2032+ events\nweighted by the h\u2032 misidentification rates, both evaluated in data. Background events from misreconstructed\nD\u2212 mesons are studied using the D\u2212 mass sideband.\nWe studied charmless hadronic B meson decays as well\nas semileptonic B \u2192 Xu l\u03bd decays using dedicated highstatistics MC samples, which are approximately equivalent to 21 and 14 times the luminosity of the data sample,\nrespectively.\n\nAfter applying the Rs requirements, 5, 23 and 40\nevents remain in the background region for the e+ e+ ,\ne+ \u03bc+ and \u03bc+ \u03bc+ modes, respectively. The background\nlevels are in good agreement with the expectations from\nthe background MC samples; 4, 22 and 38 events, respectively. The signal region of the data sample is not\nexamined until all the selection criteria are fixed and the\nsystematic uncertainties are evaluated. From the MC\nsamples the signal efficiencies are evaluated to be 1.2%\n- 1.9%, depending on the mode. Here the small difference between the MC and data samples on the particle\nID performance is corrected. In each case, the correction is approximately 2% or smaller. The expected numbkg\nbers of background events in the signal region (Nexp\n) are\n+ +\n+ +\n0.18, 0.83 and 1.44 events for the e e , e \u03bc and \u03bc+ \u03bc+\nmodes, respectively. These background expectations are\nobtained by scaling the results of a two-dimensional fit\nto the background region, where we use a common background shape for the three signal modes to compensate\nfor the low statistics. The PDFs to fit the background\ndistribution are an ARGUS function [18] for Mbc and a\nlinear function for \u2206E. We take the ratio of the integral\nof the PDF in the signal region to that in the background\nregion; its value and error are 0.036 and 0.006, respectively.\nFigure 2 shows the Mbc -\u2206E distributions of events in\nthe analysis region of the data sample, which pass all\nthe selection criteria. The signal region is unblinded and\nno events are observed in any mode, which is consistent\nwith the background expectations. Table I summarizes\nthe signal efficiency, the number of observed events and\nthe expected number of background events in the signal\nregion for each mode.\nbkg\nThe systematic uncertainties on Nexp\nare also listed in\nTable I. Each of the uncertainties combines the errors on\nthe number of events in the background region and on the\nscale factor. For the latter each PDF shape parameter\nis varied by its fit error, and the resulting changes of the\nscale factor are added in quadrature. The fit procedure\nand the uncertainty evaluation are also applied to the\nbackground MC sample. Moreover, a mode-dependent\nPDF shape, taken from the background MC sample of\neach mode, is examined in the same manner. As a conservative evaluation, the uncertainties obtained with two\nMC-based PDFs are added in quadrature in the uncertainty for each mode listed in Table I.\nSystematic uncertainties for efficiency determination\nare summarized in Table II. They are dominated by the\ntracking efficiency and the requirement of Rs . The uncertainty on the tracking efficiency is obtained by comparing partially and fully reconstructed D\u2217+ \u2192 \u03c0 + D0 ,\nD0 \u2192 KS0 (\u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays in data and MC simulation. The systematic uncertainties on the particle ID\nefficiencies are evaluated using the data control samples\nmentioned earlier. The uncertainty on the selection efficiency of the Rs requirements is evaluated from the ra-\n\n\f5\ntio of the number of events in the signal region before\nand after applying the Rs requirement for data and MC\nsamples using the B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K \u22170 mode. The number\nof events in the control sample is extracted by applying the 2-dimensional fit described earlier with a PDF\ncomponent for the corresponding decay. Since this control sample does not represent the e+ \u03bc+ mode very well,\nwe take the larger of the two dilepton mode uncertainties for the e+ \u03bc+ mode. The same control sample is\nused to evaluate the uncertainty on the efficiency of the\nsignal region acceptance. The same evaluation is applied for the uncertainty on the efficiency of the MK\u03c0\u03c0\nacceptance. A difference between the MK\u03c0\u03c0 shapes in\ndata and MC would result in the different event fractions in the signal region. The control sample used is\nB 0 \u2192 D\u2212 (\u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 )\u03c0 + , which is kinematically reconstructed after applying hadron ID requirements.\nNo events are observed in the signal region. We set\nupper limits on the branching fractions based on a frequentist approach [19]. We calculate the 90% C.L. upper limit on the branching fractions including systematic uncertainty, using the POLE program without conbkg\nditioning [20]. Except for the uncertainty on Nexp\n, all\nthe systematic uncertainties, including those on the number of B B\u0304 events (NB B\u0304 ) and on the branching fraction\nof D\u2212 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 [14], are assigned to multiplicative\nquantities in the upper limit calculation. These are found\nto be 8.8%, 9.8% and 9.7% for the e+ e+ , e+ \u03bc+ and \u03bc+ \u03bc+\nmodes, respectively, as summarized in Table II. The 90%\nCL upper limits are (1.0 \u2212 2.6) \u00d7 10\u22126 depending on the\nmode, as listed in Table I.\nIn summary, we have searched the lepton-numberviolating B + \u2192 D\u2212 l+ l\u2032+ decays for the first time. We\nfind no signal candidates. Assuming uniform three-body\nphase space distributions, we set the following upper\nlimits on the branching fractions at 90% CL: B(B + \u2192\nD\u2212 e+ e+ ) < 2.6\u00d710\u22126, B(B + \u2192 D\u2212 e+ \u03bc+ ) < 1.8\u00d710\u22126,\nand B(B + \u2192 D\u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bc+ ) < 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 .\nWe thank the KEKB group for excellent operation of\nthe accelerator, the KEK cryogenics group for efficient\nsolenoid operations, and the KEK computer group and\nthe for valuable computing and SINET4 network support.
