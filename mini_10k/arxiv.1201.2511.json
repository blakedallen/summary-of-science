This cosmic acceleration\ncan not be explained by the four known fundamental interactions in the standard models, which\nis the greatest challenge today in the modern physics. The proposals that have been put forward\nto explain this observed phenomenon can basically be classified into two categories. One is to\nassume that in the framework of Einstein's general relativity (GR), an exotic component with\nnegative pressure called dark energy (DE) is necessary to explain this observed phenomena. For\na good review on the dynamics of different DE models see [2] and references therein. Another\nalternative to account for the current accelerating cosmic expansion is to modify GR theory.\nThe well-known modified gravity theories are, for examples, f (R) theory, scalar-tensor theory\n(including Brans-Dicke theory), braneworld scenarios (such as DGP, RSI and RSII), f (G) theory\n(G is the Gauss-Bonett term), Ho\u0159ava-Lifshitz theory, MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND),\nand so forth. For some relevant reviews see [3].\nRecently, a new modified gravity theory namely the so-called f (T ) theory [4]-[13] was proposed to describe the present accelerating expansion of the universe without resorting to DE. It\nis a generalization of the teleparallel gravity (TG) [14] by replacing the so-called torsion scalar\nT with f (T ). TG was originally developed by Einstein in an attempt of unifying gravity and\nelectromagnetism. The basic variables in TG are tetrad fields ei\u03bc , where the Weitzenbock connection rather than the Levi-Civita connection was used to define the covariant derivative. As\na result, the spacetime has no curvature but contains torsion. A vector V \u03bc in TG is parallel\ntransported along a curve if its projection Vi = ei\u03bc V \u03bc remains constant, this is the so-called\nteleparallelism. The main advantage of f (T ) theory is that its field equations are the second\norder which are remarkably simpler than the fourth order equations of f (R) theory [8].\nThe other interesting issue in modern cosmology is the thermodynamical description of the\naccelerating universe driven by DE or modified gravity. It was shown that by applying the\nfirst law of thermodynamics (Clausius relation) \u2212dE = TA dSA to the apparent horizon r\u0303A , the\nFriedmann equation in the Einstein gravity can be derived if we take the Hawking temperature\nA\non the apparent horizon, where A is the area of the\nTA = 1/(2\u03c0r\u0303A ) and the entropy SA = 4G\nhorizon [15]. Here, dE is the amount of energy flow through the fixed apparent horizon. The\nequivalence between the first law of thermodynamics and the Friedmann equation was also found\nfor gravity with Gauss-Bonnet term, the Lovelock gravity theory and the braneworld scenarios\n[15, 16, 17].\nNote that in the thermodynamics of the apparent horizon in the Einstein gravity, the geoA\nmetric entropy is assumed to be proportional to its horizon area, SA = 4G\n[15]. However, this\ndefinition is changed for other modified gravity theories. For instance, the geometric entropy in\nR\nf (R) gravity is given by SA = Af\n4G [18], where the subscript R denotes a derivative with respect\nto the curvature scalar R. In f (T ) gravity, it was shown that when fT T is small, the first law of\nT\nblack hole thermodynamics is satisfied approximatively and the entropy of horizon is SA = Af\n4G\n[19], where the subscript T denotes a derivative with respect to the torsion scalar T .\nBesides examining the validity of the thermodynamical interpretation of gravity by expressing\nthe gravitational field equations into the first law of thermodynamics in different spacetimes,\nit is also of great interest to investigate the validity of the generalized second law (GSL) of\nthermodynamics in the accelerating universe [20]-[28]. The GSL of thermodynamics like the\nfirst law is an accepted principle in physics.\nHere, our aim is to investigate the GSL of thermodynamics in the framework of f (T ) gravity\n2\n\n\ffor a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe filled with the pressureless\nmatter. To do this, in section 2, we briefly review the f (T ) gravity. In section 3, we investigate\nthe GSL of thermodynamics on the dynamical apparent horizon with the Hawking temperature.\nIn section 4, for two viable f (T ) models we first calculate the effective equation of state and\ndeceleration parameters. Then, the null and strong energy conditions are investigated. Also the\nviability of both models is checked by cosmography. Finally, the validity of the GSL is examined.\nSection 5 is devoted to conclusions.\n\n2\n\nBrief review of f (T ) gravity\n\nIn the framework of f (T ) theory, the action of modified TG is given by [7]\n1\nI=\n16\u03c0G\n\nZ\n\nh\n\ni\n\nd4 x e f (T ) + Lm ,\n\n(1)\n\n\u221a\nwhere e = det(ei\u03bc ) = \u2212g and Lm is the Lagrangian density of the matter inside the universe.\nAlso ei\u03bc is the vierbein field which is used as a dynamical object in TG.\nThe modified Friedmann equations in the framework of f (T ) gravity in the spatially flat\nFRW universe are given by [8, 10]\nH2 =\n\n8\u03c0G\n(\u03c1m + \u03c1T ),\n3\n\n3\n\u1e22 + H 2 = \u22124\u03c0G(pm + pT ),\n2\nwhere\n\u03c1T =\npT = \u2212\n\n1\n(2T fT \u2212 f \u2212 T ),\n16\u03c0G\n\n1\n[\u22128\u1e22T fT T + (2T \u2212 4\u1e22)fT \u2212 f + 4\u1e22 \u2212 T ],\n16\u03c0G\nT = \u22126H 2 ,\n\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n\nand H = \u0227/a is the Hubble parameter. Here \u03c1m and pm are the energy density and pressure\nof the matter, respectively. Also \u03c1T and pT are the torsion contributions to the energy density\nand pressure. The energy conservation laws are still given by\n\u03c1\u0307m + 3H(\u03c1m + pm ) = 0,\n\n(7)\n\n\u03c1\u0307T + 3H(\u03c1T + pT ) = 0.\n\n(8)\n\nNote that if f (T ) = T , from Eqs. (4) and (5) we have \u03c1T = 0 and pT = 0 then Eqs. (2) and (3)\ntransform to the usual Friedmann equations in GR.\nThe effective equation of state (EoS) parameter due to the torsion contribution is defined as\n[8, 10]\n\u0012\n\u0013\npT\n\u1e6a\n2T fT T + fT \u2212 1\n\u03c9T =\n= \u22121 \u2212\n.\n(9)\n\u03c1T\n3H\n2T fT \u2212 f \u2212 T\nNote that for the de Sitter universe, i.e. \u1e22 = 0 = \u1e6a , we have \u03c9T = \u22121 behaving like the\ncosmological constant.\nUsing Eqs. (2), (4) and (6) we have\n\u03c1m =\n\n1\n(f \u2212 2T fT ).\n16\u03c0G\n3\n\n(10)\n\n\fHere, we consider a spatially flat FRW universe filled with the pressureless matter, i.e. pm = 0.\nWe ignore the contribution of radiation which is compatible with the observations [29]. From\nEqs. (2) to (5) for pm = 0, one can obtain\n\u1e22 = \u2212\n\n4\u03c0G\u03c1m\n.\nfT + 2T fT T\n\n(11)\n\nSubstituting Eq. (10) into (11) and using \u1e6a = \u221212H \u1e22, one can get\n\u1e6a = 3H\n\n\u0012\n\nf \u2212 2T fT\nfT + 2T fT T\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\nWith the help of above relation, the effective EoS parameter (9) can be rewritten as\n\u03c9T = \u2212\n\nf /T \u2212 fT + 2T fT T\n.\n(fT + 2T fT T )(f /T \u2212 2fT + 1)\n\n(13)\n\nFor the deceleration parameter\nq = \u22121 \u2212\n\n\u1e22\n,\nH2\n\n(14)\n\nusing Eqs. (6) and (12) one can obtain\n3f\nfT \u2212 T fT T \u2212 4T\nq=2\nfT + 2T fT T\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(15)\n\nFor the case f (T ) = T , we get q = 0.5 corresponding to the matter dominated phase.\n\n3\n\nGSL in f (T ) gravity\n\nHere, we investigate the validity of the GSL for a spatially flat FRW universe filled with the\npressureless barionc matter (BM) and dark matter (DM). According to the GSL, the entropy\nof matter inside the horizon plus the entropy of the horizon must not decrease in time [15]. We\nassume that the boundary of the universe to be enclosed by the dynamical apparent horizon r\u0303A .\nAlso the Hawking temperature on the apparent horizon r\u0303A is given by [15]\n1\nTA =\n2\u03c0r\u0303A\n\nr\u0303 \u0307 A\n1\u2212\n2H r\u0303A\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(16)\n\n \u0307\n\nwhere 2Hr\u0303Ar\u0303A < 1 ensures that the temperature is positive.\nThe entropy of the universe including BM and DM inside the dynamical apparent horizon\nis given by Gibb's equation [20]\nTA dSm = dEm + pm dV,\n\n(17)\n\n3 /3 is the volume containing the pressureless matter with the radius\nwhere pm = 0 and V = 4\u03c0r\u0303A\nof the dynamical apparent horizon r\u0303A . Also\n\nEm =\n\n3\n4\u03c0r\u0303A\n\u03c1m .\n3\n\n(18)\n\nTaking time derivative of both sides of Eq. (18) and using (7), Gibb's equation (17) yields\n2\nTA \u1e60m = 4\u03c0r\u0303A\n\u03c1m (r\u0303 \u0307 A \u2212 H r\u0303A ),\n\n4\n\n(19)\n\n\fwhere the dot denotes a time derivative. Substituting Eq. (10) into (19) gives\n2\nr\u0303A\n(r\u0303 \u0307 A \u2212 H r\u0303A )(f \u2212 2T fT ).\n4G\n\nTA \u1e60m =\n\n(20)\n\nNow we need to calculate the contribution of the apparent horizon entropy. Following [19], when\nfT T is small, the horizon entropy in f (T ) gravity is given by\nSA =\n\nAfT\n,\n4G\n\n(21)\n\n2 . For the special case f (T ) = T , Eq. (21) recovers the Bekenstein-Hawking\nwhere A = 4\u03c0r\u0303A\nA\nentropy SA = 4G in the Einstein gravity.\nUsing Eq. (16), the evolution of horizon entropy (21) is obtained as\n\nr\u0303 \u0307 A\n1\u2212\n2H r\u0303A\n\n1\nTA \u1e60A =\n2G\n\n!\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n2r\u0303 \u0307 A fT + r\u0303A \u1e6a fT T .\n\n(22)\n\nInserting Eq.

In what follows, we investigate the validity of the GSL, i.e. TA \u1e60tot \u2265 0, for\ntwo viable f (T ) models introduced in the literature.\n5\n\n\f4\n\nTwo viable f (T ) models\n\nHere, we consider two viable f (T ) models proposed by [9, 11] to explain the present cosmic\naccelerating expansion of the universe. The first model is a power law\nf (T ) = T + \u03bc1 (\u2212T )n ,\n\nModel 1,\n\n(30)\n\nwhere \u03bc1 and n are constants [9, 11]. The second model has an exponential dependence on the\ntorsion scalar as\n\u0010\nT0 \u0011\nModel 2,\n(31)\nf (T ) = T \u2212 \u03bc2 T 1 \u2212 e\u03b2 T ,\n\nwhere \u03bc2 and \u03b2 are two model parameters, and T0 = \u22126H02 [9].\nThe parameters \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 can be obtained by inserting Eqs. (30) and (31) into the modified\nFriedmann Eq. (2). Solving the resulting equations for the present time gives\n\u03bc1 =\n\n\u0012\n\n1 \u2212 \u03a9m0\n2n \u2212 1\n\n\u03bc2 =\n8\u03c0G\u03c1\n\n\u0013\n\n(6H02 )1\u2212n ,\n\n1 \u2212 \u03a9m0\n,\n1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 2\u03b2)e\u03b2\n\n(32)\n(33)\n\nwhere \u03a9m0 = 3H 2m0 is the dimensionless matter energy density and the index 0 denotes the\n0\nvalue of a quantity at the present. Note that both models can unify a number of interesting\nextensions of gravity beyond the standard GR. For instance, model 1 for the cases n = 0 and\nn = 1/2 reduces to the \u039bCDM and DGP [31] models, respectively. Model 2 acts like the \u039bCDM\nfor \u03b2 = 0. Also both models can satisfy the condition\nlim f /T \u2192 1,\n\nT \u2192\u221e\n\n(34)\n\nat high redshift which is compatible with the primordial nucleosynthesis and CMB constraints\n[9, 11]. For model 1 to be a viable model compared to current data one needs n \u226a 1 [9, 11].\nThe joint analysis of the astronomical data from SNeIa+BAO+CMB gives the best fit values\n+0.036\n+0.31\n+0.036\n(n = 0.04+0.22\n\u22120.33 , \u03a9m0 = 0.272\u22120.032 ) for model 1 and (\u03b2 = \u22120.02\u22120.20 , \u03a9m0 = 0.272\u22120.034 ) for\nmodel 2 at the 95% confidence level (CL) [9].\nUsing the statefinder geometrical analysis and Om(z) diagnostic method, it was shown that\nboth model 1 and model 2 evolve from the standard cold DM (SCDM) to a de Sitter phase [9].\nAlso the effective DE for model 2 with \u03b2 6= 0 is similar to the \u039bCDM both in the high redshift\nregimes and in the future, while for model 1 with n 6= 0 this similarity occurs only in the future\n[9].\nThe evolution of the effective EoS parameter, Eq. (13), for model 1 and model 2 is plotted\nin Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. Figures show that from the early times to the present epoch, both\nmodels behave like quintessence DE, i.e. \u03c9T > \u22121, and their effective EoS parameters can not\ncross the phantom divide line [32]. This result has been already obtained by [9, 11]. At early\ntimes (T /T0 \u2192 +\u221e), for model 1 and model 2 we have \u03c9T \u2243 \u22120.96 and \u22121, respectively. Model\n2 behaves like the \u039bCDM at high redshift. At the present time (T /T0 = 1), for model 1 and\nmodel 2 we obtain \u03c9T0 \u2243 \u22120.989 and \u22120.992, respectively. An interesting result which is absent\nin [9, 11] is that in the future (1 < T /T0 < 0) for model 1 and model 2 at T /T0 \u2243 0.718 and\n0.719, respectively, we have a transition from the quintessence state, \u03c9T > \u22121, to the phantom\nregime, \u03c9T < \u22121.\nThe evolution of the deceleration parameter, Eq. (15), for model 1 and model 2 is plotted\nin Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. Figures illustrate that for model 1 and model 2 in the past\n6\n\n\fT /T0 \u2243 2.194 and 2.199, respectively, we have a cosmic deceleration q > 0 to acceleration q < 0\ntransition which is compatible with the observations [33]. At early times (T /T0 \u2192 +\u221e), for\nboth models we obtain q \u2243 0.5 which indicates that the universe was experiencing a phase of\ndeceleration at the early stage of its evolution due to the domination of the matter component.\nAt the present time (T /T0 = 1), for model 1 and model 2 we get q0 \u2243 \u22120.580 and \u22120.583,\nrespectively, which are in good agreement with the recent observational result \u22121.4 \u2264 q0 \u2264 \u22120.3\n[33].\nThe evolution of \u03c1T + pT versus TT0 for model 1 and model 2 is plotted in Figs. 9 and 10,\nrespectively. Figures show that the null energy condition (NEC), i.e. \u03c1T + pT \u2265 0, is violated for\nmodel 1 when T /T0 \u2208 (0.025, 0.718) and for model 2 when T /T0 \u2208 (0, 0.017) and (0.138, 0.719).\nWhen the EoS parameter of DE is less than \u22121, the universe reaches a Big Rip singularity within\na finite time. In this case, the NEC is violated. Barrow [35] showed that a different type of future\nsingularity, the so-called sudden singularity, can appear at a finite time even when the strong\nenergy condition (SEC), i.e. \u03c1T + 3pT \u2265 0 and \u03c1T + pT \u2265 0, is satisfied. This type of future\nsingularity corresponds to the one in which the pressure density pT diverges at T = Ts , but the\nenergy density \u03c1T is finite. The properties of different future singularities in the DE universe\nhave been investigated in ample detail by [36]. Our numerical results show that the sudden\nfuture singularity appears in model 1 and model 2 when (Ts /T0 = 0.025, 16\u03c0G\u03c1T = 20754)\nand (Ts /T0 = 0.138, 16\u03c0G\u03c1T = 19822), respectively. Also the SEC for model 1 and model 2 is\nsatisfied only when T /T0 \u2208 (0, 0.025) and T /T0 \u2208 (0.018, 0.138), respectively.\n\n4.1\n\nCosmographic analysis\n\nHere, following Capozziello et al. [37] we use a cosmographic analysis to check the viability of\nmodel 1 and model 2 without the need of explicitly solving the field equations and fitting the\ndata. In this approach, the parameters of a given f (T ) model must be chosen in such a way that\nthe model-independent constraints on the cosmographic parameters (h, q0 , j0 , s0 , l0 ) obtained by\nfitting to SNeIa Hubble diagram and BAO data are satisfied. Here, h is the Hubble constant\nand q0 , j0 , s0 , l0 are the deceleration, jerk, snap, and lerk parameters, respectively. Let us first\nstart with model 2. Using Eqs. (4.21) and (4.22) in [37] one can find\n\u03bc2 =\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n\u2212 1 (1 \u2212 \u03a9m0 ).\n\u03b2\n\u0013\n\n(35)\n\nNow the fi = f (i) (T0 )/(6H02 )\u2212(i\u22121) value for i = (2, 3, 4, 5) where f (i) (T ) = di f /dT i can be\nexpressed as function of \u03b2 only when we fix \u03a9m0 = 0.1329/h2 from the WMAP7 data. Following\n[37] for each f2 value of the sample obtained above from the cosmographic parameters analysis,\nwe solve f\u02c62 (\u03b2) = f2 . This yields \u03b2 = \u22120.2 which takes place in the 95% CL from the modeldependent constraints [9]. Then, we estimate the theoretically expected values for the other\nderivatives (f3 , f4 , f5 ). The median and 68% and 95% confidence ranges are obtained as\nf3 = 0.371+0.117+0.148\n\u22120.351\u22120.914\nf4 = 1.385+0.380+0.473\n\u22121.302\u22123.709\nf5 = 6.447+1.498+1.832\n\u22126.033\u221218.852 .\n\n(36)\n\nNow we compare the above results with the model-independent constraints on the fi values\ngiven in Table II in [37]. Following [37] we use only the 68% CL which we compare the above\nconstraints to. Our comparison shows that the values of (f3 , f4 , f5 ) take place in the 68% CL in\nTable II in [37]. Therefore, we conclude that model 2 is favored by the observational data.\n7\n\n\fFor model 1, its cosmographic analysis has been already done by Capozziello et al. [37].\nThey showed that for the best fit value of the cosmographic parameters, solving f\u02c62 (n) = f2\nyields n = \u22120.011. Note that the value of n takes place in the 95% CL from the modeldependent constraints [9]. Capozziello et al. [37] found quite small values for (f3 , f4 , f5 ) as\nexpected for the \u039bCDM model. Here, the disagreement with the constraints in Table II in [37]\nmay be due to this fact that depending on the value of n, assuming f (i) (T0 ) = 0 for i \u2265 6 in\nTaylor expanding f (T ) can fail for model 1 so that the constraints on fi should not be considered\nreliable [37].\n\n4.2\n\nExamining the GSL for model 1 and model 2\n\nHere, we examine the validity of the GSL, Eq. (28), for both models. First, we need to check\nthe validity of the horizon entropy relation (21). Because as we already mentioned, Eq. (21) is\nvalid only when fT T is small [19]. To check this, we plot fT T versus T /T0 for model 1 and model\n2 in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. Figures show that the fT T is very small throughout history of\nthe universe. This confirms the validity of Eq. (21) for both models.\nNow we can calculate the GSL, Eq. (28), for both models. For model 1, the resulting GSL\nis\nTA \u1e60tot =\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n\nn\u22121\n\n9 \uf8ef 1 + \u03bc1 (1 \u2212 2n)(\u2212T )\n\uf8fa\n\uf8f0\u0010\n\u0011 \uf8fb\nn\u22121 2\n8\n1 + \u03bc1 n(1 \u2212 2n)(\u2212T )\nh\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\ni\n\n\u00d7 1 + 1 \u2212 n(2 + n) \u03bc1 (\u2212T )n\u22121 + n(1 \u2212 2n) 4 \u2212 n(9 \u2212 4n) \u03bc21 (\u2212T )2n\u22122 ,(37)\nand for model 2 we obtain\nTA \u1e60tot =\n\nI\n\u0014\n\n8T (1 \u2212 \u03bc2 )T 2 + \u03bc2 (T 2 \u2212 \u03b2T0 T + 2\u03b2 2 T02 )e\n\n\u03b2T0\nT\n\n\u00152 ,\n\n(38)\n\nwhere\nh\n\nI = 9(1 \u2212 \u03bc2 )3 T 5 + 9\u03bc2 (3 \u2212 2\u03bc2 )T 5 \u2212 5\u03b2T0 (1 + \u03bc2 \u2212 \u03bc22 )T 4\n\u0010\n\n+\u03b2 2 T02 (1 + 17\u03bc2 \u2212 9\u03bc22 )T 3 \u2212 4\u03bc2 \u03b2 3 T03 (5 \u2212 2\u03bc2 )T\n\u0011\n\ni\n\n+\u03b2T0 (1 \u2212 2\u03bc2 ) T + 16\u03bc22 T05 \u03b2 5 e\n\n\u03b2T0\nT\n\n.\n\n(39)\n\nThe evolutions of the GSL (37) and (38) are plotted in Figs. 7 and 8, respectively. Figures clear\nthat for both model 1 and model 2, the GSL is satisfied from the early times to the present\nepoch. At early times (T /T0 \u2192 +\u221e), for both models we have GTA \u1e60tot \u2243 1.125. At the present\ntime (T /T0 = 1), for model 1 and model 2 we get GTA \u1e60tot \u2243 0.116 and 0.010, respectively.\nNote that in the future (1 < T /T0 < 0), Fig. 7 clears that the GSL for model 1 is violated,\ni.e. GTA \u1e60tot < 0, for T /T0 \u2208 (0, 0.133) and (0.569, 0.718). Also in the future, according to Fig.\n8 the GSL for model 2, like model 1, is violated for T /T0 \u2208 (0.005, 0.017), (0.039, 0.321) and\n(0.603, 0.719). Figures 7 and 8 don't show the negative values of the GSL, because the axis of\nGTA \u1e60tot is based on a logarithmic scale.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nHere, we studied the GSL in the framework of f (T ) gravity. Among other approaches related\nwith a variety of DE models, a very promising approach to DE is related with the modified\n8\n\n\fTG known as f (T ) gravity, in which DE emerges from the modification of torsion. The class of\nf (T ) gravity theories is an intriguing generalization of Einstein's new GR, taking a curvaturefree approach and using a connection with torsion. It is analogous to the f (R) extension of\nthe Einstein-Hilbert action of standard GR, but has the advantage of the second order field\nequations [11]. We investigated the GSL on the Hubble horizon with the Hawking temperature\nfor a spatially flat FRW universe filled with the pressureless matter. For two viable f (T ) models\nT0\n\ncontaining f (T ) = T + \u03bc1 (\u2212T )n and f (T ) = T \u2212 \u03bc2 T (1 \u2212 e\u03b2 T ), we first calculated the effective\nEoS and deceleration parameters. Interestingly enough, we found that for both models there\nis a transition from the quintessence state, \u03c9T > \u22121, to the phantom regime, \u03c9T < \u22121, in the\nfuture. Also both models showed a cosmic deceleration q > 0 to acceleration q < 0 transition\nin the near past which is compatible with the observations [33]. Furthermore, we investigated\nthe NEC and SEC and concluded that both models show a sudden future singularity. Also our\ncosmographic analysis cleared that model 1 is unable to predict the observationally motivated\n(f2 , f3 , f4 , f5 ) values but model 2 is favored by the observational data. Finally, we examined the\nvalidity of the GSL for the selected f (T ) models. We concluded that the GSL is satisfied for\nboth models from the early times to the present epoch. But in the future, the GSL is violated for\nmodel 1 when T /T0 \u2208 (0, 0.133) and (0.569, 0.718) and for model 2 when T /T0 \u2208 (0.005, 0.017),\n(0.039, 0.321) and (0.603, 0.719).\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors thank the anonymous referee for a number of valuable suggestions.
