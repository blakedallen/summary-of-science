Laboratory and numerical experiments illustrate this\nnew approach.\nSubject headings: cosmic mirage - gravitational lens - lens inversion - multiply imaged\nquasars\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nZwicky (1937a,b) first proposed to use foreground galaxies as natural telescopes to observe\notherwise too distant and faint background objects. The idea was either to take advantage of the\ngravitational lens amplification of the multiple unresolved images in order to obtain higher S/N\nobservations of the background object(s) or to directly re-image, with a significantly improved\nangular resolution, the real extended source from the observed gravitational lens mirage. Numerical lens inversions have been successfully applied in the past to several cases among which the\nfamous radio Einstein ring MG 1131+0456 (Kochanek et al. 1989), the triply imaged giant arc in\nthe galaxy cluster Cl 0024+1654 (Wallington et al. 1995), the radio Einstein ring MG 1654+134\n(Wallington et al. 1994, 1996), the optical Einstein ring 0047-2808 (Dye & Warren 2005), the multiply imaged double source B1608+656 (Suyu et al. 2006), the quadruply imaged quasar RXS J11311231 (Claeskens et al. 2006) or still, more recently, the large sample of lensed galaxies observed by\nthe SLACS collaboration (Bolton et al. 2008). In the present paper, we show how to make use of\nan ad-hoc optical device at the telescope in order to directly invert an observed gravitational lens\nmirage.\nFirst of all, we lay down in section 2 the basic principles of gravitational lensing inversion based\nupon straightforward ray tracing diagrams. We then show in section 3 how to use a point mass lens\noptical simulator to invert a gravitational lens mirage produced by a point mass deflector. After\nsimulating in the laboratory an Einstein ring, a doubly or a quadruply imaged source, we show in\nsection 4 how to invert the latter ones in order to retrieve the original source image. In section 5, we\nhave made use of numerical simulations to confirm the expected properties of this type of hardware\ninversion. In section 6, we present a possible design for the optimal gravitational lens telescope\nand discuss the future prospects of gravitational lensing inversion using more sophisticated optical\ndevices. Some general conclusions form the last section.\n\n2.\n\nBasic principles of gravitational lensing inversion\n\nWe have illustrated in Figure 1 the possible deflection of light rays coming from a very distant\nsource (S) by a foreground cosmic deflector (D, a galaxy here). We have assumed that in the\npresent case, the observer located at left sees three lensed images of the distant source (S).\nIf one would set at the observer location three little mirrors, each parallel to the incoming\nwavefronts associated with each of the three beams of parallel light rays, the latter would travel\nback towards the source along their original trajectories in accordance with the principle of inverse\ntravel of light, assuming of course the case of a static Universe. Instead, let us suppose that at the\nlocation of the observer we just set a pinhole screen (PS) in order to only let the three incoming\nbeams of parallel light rays continue their travels towards the left. The size of the pinhole is typically\nthat of the telescope aperture used to directly image the cosmic mirages. Furthermore, let us place\nat a symmetric location with respect to the pinhole a galaxy (D2) similar to the original deflector\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n\nFig. 1.- Formation of a 3-lensed image mirage by gravitational lensing.\n\n(D1), but turned around by 180\u25e6 . We then obtain the ray tracing diagram depicted in Figure 2.\nLet us now assume that we could set the deflector at left (D2) much closer to the pinhole\n(PS, see Figure 3). The deflector at left is still supposed to be perfectly aligned with the deflector\nat right (D1) and the pinhole. Let us suppose that the D2 deflector is now 3 times closer to the\npinhole compared with the distance to the D1 galaxy. In order to preserve the same deflection\nangles \u03b1 for the outgoing light rays at left, one simply needs to decrease the mass of the D2\ndeflector also by a factor 3, since r has been reduced itself by the same factor, keeping of course\nidentical the relative mass distribution between D2 and D1. Indeed, for the case of a symmetric\nmass distribution, we have \u03b1 = 4GM (r)c\u22122 r \u22121 where M (r) represents the mass of the galaxy\nlocated within the impact parameter r; G and c being the universal constant of gravitation and\nthe velocity of light (Refsdal & Surdej 1994). If the ratio M (r)/r is kept constant, the deflection\nangle \u03b1 remains unaltered.\nIt is interesting to note that the ray tracing diagram shown in Figure 3 is very reminiscent\nof the propagation of light rays through a classical refractor, the main objective (cf. D1) being\nlocated at right from the pinhole screen (PS) and the eyepiece (D2) at left. Let us however note a\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n\nFig. 2.- This figure results from the superposition of the ray tracing diagram shown in Figure 1\nand a copy of it, rotated by 180\u25e6 . In this way, we clearly see that the light rays passing through\nthe pinhole screen (PS) get similarly deflected, but in an opposite direction, to those coming from\nthe distant source (S). The three beams of light rays passing the second, inverted, deflecting galaxy\n(D2) thus continue their travel as three parallel beams of light rays.\n\nFig. 3.- Same as in Figure 2 but for the case of a deflector (D2) at left being located at a distance\nthree times closer to the pinhole screen (PS) and being also three times less massive than the\noriginal deflector (D1).\n\nbig difference: in the present case, it is as if the main objective were diluted since only three (and\nnot an infinity of) beams of parallel light rays propagate through such a gravitational lens refractor.\nFurthermore, these beams reaching the pinhole screen (or the observer) are mutually incoherent.\nFor convenience and simplicity, we shall consider in the remainder that the deflector is a point\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nmass lens. In this case, the corresponding gravitational lens refractor is similar to that in Figure\n3 with the exception that in general only two beams of parallel light rays go through the pinhole\nscreen (see Figure 4). Indeed, due to the singularity of this type of lens, the third central image is\nsimply being suppressed (Refsdal & Surdej 1994).\n\nFig. 4.- A two lensed image mirage produced by a cosmic point mass lens (P1) at right. The two\nincoming beams of parallel light rays pass through the pinhole screen (PS) and get deflected by a\npoint-mass lens object (P2) at left, at a distance 3 times closer from the pinhole and which mass\nis also 3 times smaller than that of the original cosmic point mass lens (P1). Alike for the case\ndiscussed in Figure 3, the outgoing light rays are again parallel.\n\nIf we were now capable of setting the point mass lens object (P2) at left at a still much closer\ndistance from the pinhole (PS), also decreasing accordingly its mass, the separation between the\ntwo outgoing parallel beams of light rays at left would get similarly smaller. Let us assume that\nthis separation gets so small that it matches the size of an optical lens.\nCould we then replace the point mass lens object P2 by a laboratory lens simulator that would\nperfectly mimic the light deflection of the former? To our knowledge, Liebes (1969) was the first\nto propose using an optical lens having the shape of the foot of a wine glass to simulate the light\ndeflection by a point mass lens. The design and construction of such optical lenses corresponding to any type of axially symmetric mass distributions have been presented and discussed by\nRefsdal & Surdej (1994). These authors have also described how to use such lenses to produce the\nvarious configurations of cosmic mirages observed in the Universe.\n\n3.\n\nThe point-mass lens optical simulator and inversion of a gravitational lens mirage\n\nFigure 5 illustrates (a) the typical shape of the foot of a wine glass and (b) a corresponding\nsimulator made of Plexiglas which has been used to simulate the light deflection of a point mass\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nlens having approximately 2/3 the mass of the Earth when set at a distance of 1m from an observer\neye.\n\nFig. 5.- Shape (a) and photograph (b) of an optical lens simulator corresponding to the case of a\npoint mass lens. Such a lens is made of Plexiglas and its shape, similar to that of the foot of a wine\nglass, is essentially determined by the mass of the point mass deflector (Refsdal & Surdej 1994).\nFor the lens shown on the photograph, the corresponding mass is approximately 2/3 the mass of\nthe Earth.\nWe may now conveniently replace in Figure 4 the small size cosmic point mass lens (P2) at\nleft by an optical point mass gravitational lens simulator (S2) characterized by the same mass (see\nFigure 6).\nStill further at left, we set a converging lens (CL) so that a perfect image of the distant\nsource (S) is formed in its focal plane. The real gain in proceeding so is to observe the recombined\nimage of the distant source with a significant increase in angular resolution, corresponding to the\nhighest magnification(s) provided by the point mass cosmic lens (P1), at right. A simple laboratory\nexperiment illustrating these principles is proposed in the next section.\n\n4.\n\nThe laboratory gravitational lens experiment for the case of a point mass lens\n\nFor purely didactical purposes, the Faculty of Sciences from the Li\u00e8ge University has proceeded\nto the manufacturing of a large series of optical gravitational lens simulators alike the one shown in\nFigure 5 (b) (see http://www2.ulg.ac.be/sciences/lentille/dp-lentilleweb.pdf). In order\nto illustrate the principles exposed in the previous section, we have thus decided to use two such\noptical lenses in the laboratory: one (S1) to produce a mirage and the second one (S2) to invert\nthe resulting lensed images. The corresponding ray tracing diagram is shown in Figure 7 while the\nlaboratory experiment is shown in Figures 8 and 9.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n\nFig. 6.- Same as Figure 4 but the small size cosmic lens at left (P2) has been replaced by an optical\npoint mass lens simulator (S2) corresponding to the same mass. Since the separation between the\ntwo outgoing parallel beams of light rays is now reduced to several tens of centimetres, or even\nsmaller, it is easy to place at left a classical converging lens (CL) so that a perfect, lens inverted,\nimage of the distant source at right (S) is formed in its focal plane.\n\nFig. 7.- The first point mass gravitational lens simulator (S1) at right produces a doubly imaged\nsource as seen from the pinhole (PS) while the second lens simulator (S2) inverts the mirage into\ntwo parallel beams of light rays which are then focused at left by a classical converging lens (CL).\n\nVarious experiments have been carried out in the laboratory, by tilting (or not) and/or translating (or not) with respect to each other the two optical point mass gravitational lens simulators\nS1 and S2, also for the case of a double point-like laser source image S. We have illustrated in\nFigure 10 some of the resulting lensed images seen on the intermediate white screen (WS) placed\nbetween the pinhole screen (PS) and the S2 lens (cf. Figure 9). Finally, keeping always the S1\nand S2 lenses parallel to each other and symmetrically placed with respect to the pinhole, we have\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n\nFig. 8.- Optical bench in the laboratory showing from right to left the laser point source (LS)\nobtained with a spatial filter (microscope objective combined with a pinhole screen), followed by\na lens (C) that collimates the light rays into a parallel beam which enters the first point mass\ngravitational lens simulator (S1). Some of the deflected rays then encounter the pinhole screen\n(PS) and enter the second optical lens simulator (S2). The outgoing light rays are finally focused\nby means of a converging lens (CL) on the white screen (WS) set at the extreme left.\n\nobserved for various configurations the images formed on the white screen (WS) placed at the extreme left position on the optical bench as shown in Figure 8. In all cases, we either observe (see\nFigure 11) the formation of a single point-like image or that of a double one, in case the original\nsource (LS) consisted of a double point-like laser source. We have thus succeeded in inverting the\nmultiple lensed images produced by the S1 point mass lens simulator into the original, single or\ndouble, laser source image.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n\nFig. 9.- Another view of the laboratory optical bench (see also Figure 8). In this case, the first\npoint mass gravitational lens simulator (S1) has been somewhat tilted with respect to the axis of\nthe optical bench. By placing a white screen (WS) just behind the pinhole screen (PS), one sees\nthe formation of a quadruply imaged source, in accordance with the predictions made for the case\nof a point mass lens in presence of an external shear (Refsdal & Surdej 1994).\n\n5.\n\nNumerical simulations\n\nMatlab software applications have been developed to simulate the propagation of light rays\nthrough two optical point mass lens simulators alike those used in the laboratory. The ray tracings have been performed considering the refractive properties of the optical simulators (shapes,\nrefractive index n = 1.49, etc.). Numerical 2D and 3D simulations have been carried out for various tilts and translations of the S1 and S2 simulators, also for different sizes of these lenses and\ntheir positions with respect to the pinhole. Typical examples of such simulations are illustrated in\nFigures 12 and 13. Such simulations have been carried out for various source positions as well as\nfor the case of multiple point-like sources. In all cases, the inversions by the optical gravitational\nlens simulator S2 of the mirages produced by the simulator S1 have properly restored in the focal\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n\nFig. 10.- In case of perfect alignment between the source (LS), the pinhole (PS) and the optical lens\n(S1), set perpendicularly with respect to the axis of the optical bench, there results the formation\nof an Einstein ring (a) as seen on the white screen (WS) set between the pinhole (PS) and the S2\nlens (cf. Figure 9). If we slightly translate the S1 lens, along a direction transverse to the axis of\nthe optical bench, the Einstein ring breaks in two lensed images (b).

The diameter of the spot(s) seen in\n(a) and (b) is approximately 2mm.

The idea is first to extinguish as much\nas possible the direct light from the foreground deflector which might be a galaxy, a star, a quasar,\netc. To do so, we centre the light of the deflector on the mask of a coronagraphic device. The mask\ncould either be a classical Lyot one if the foreground deflector is resolved or a phase mask alike\nan annular groove phase mask in case the deflector is point-like (Mawet et al. 2005), see Figure\n14. Just behind, a lens (C) collimates the light rays from the observed mirage (a doubly imaged\npoint-like source for the case shown in Figure 14) and forms an exit pupil of the telescope aperture\nwhere a Lyot stop is placed. The optical point mass lens simulator (S2), or another ad-hoc optical\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n\nFig. 13.- Another example of 3-D ray tracing simulations performed with the Matlab software\nfor the case of the two optical point mass lens simulators (S1 and S2) which centers have been\nproperly aligned with the pinhole (PS). The two simulators have been kept parallel to each other\nbut slightly tilted (20\u25e6 ) and translated along a transverse direction with respect to the axis of the\noptical bench. Note that one of the lenses (S2) is half as massive as the other one (S1) and placed\nat half the distance with respect to the pinhole in order to provide an overall optimal gravitational\nlens telescope.\n\ndevice adapted to the specific mass distribution of the lens, then inverts the mirage and produces\ntwo (or more) parallel beams of light rays. Finally a classical converging lens (CL) produces in\nits focal plane a single image of the multiply imaged distant source. This is a possible design for\nthe optimal gravitational lens telescope which ideally restores in its focal plane a single real and\nfaithful image from the direct imaging of a multiply imaged source.\nAs can be seen in Figure 14, only very small regions of the lens simulator (S2 in the present\ncase) are actually involved in the lens inversion process. One could therefore think of possibly\nreplacing this lens simulator by a computer generated holographic lens or even a deformable mirror\nsuch that the entropy of the recombined image in the focal plane of the converging lens gets\nminimized. Conversely, one could use the lens model inferred from the numerical lens inversion\nof a known gravitational lens system to design the corresponding optical lens inversion simulator.\nDirect imaging of the gravitational lens mirage with such an optical device would then permit\nthe direct observation of the original source image as well as to possibly detect still much fainter\nobjects located behind and near the foreground deflector. Compared to the numerical inversion\nmethod, the sensitivity should be higher since the light from the source is now concentrated on a\nsmaller number of pixels compared to the spread of the multiple images over a larger number of\npixels. This is specially true whenever the noise in the faint lensed images is dominated by the\nCCD read-out-noise. Moreover, the coronagraphic device removes the light from the deflector that\nwould otherwise be spread over the detector. As far as the final angular resolution is concerned,\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nwe should select a pixel size and/or adapt the focal length of the CL lens (see Figure 14) in such a\nway that the most magnified image of the source is not undersampled.\nFor the particular case of nearby stars assuming that their mass and distance are precisely\nknown, one could directly design optical lens simulators alike those shown in Figure 5 and search\nfor very faint and distant background objects located behind and near these stellar cosmic lenses.\nNote that some of the cosmological lenses may turn out to have a complex structure. For these,\nthe corresponding optical lens inversion simulators ought to be more sophisticated.\nMany other applications might be envisaged.\n\nFig. 14.- A simple unfolded model of the optimal gravitational lens telescope. It is here assumed\nthat the astronomical telescope pointed towards a gravitational lens system produces in its focal\nplane at right two lensed images (A & B) of a distant source as well as the image of the deflector\n(D). The latter has been centred on the Lyot or phase mask (PM) of the coronagraphic device\nshown in this figure. The lens C collimates the light, forming also an exit pupil where a Lyot stop\nis placed. The optical point mass lens simulator S2 then inverts the observed gravitational lens\nmirage into two parallel beams of light rays which are then focused at left by a classical converging\nlens (CL). A single image of the original source, originally observed as a multiply imaged object,\nhas thus been restored in the focal plane of CL.\n\n7.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have shown in the present paper how Zwicky's proposition (Zwicky 1937a,b) to use foreground deflectors as giant cosmic lenses could be directly achieved at the telescope, using a phase\nmask coronagraph equipped with an ad-hoc optical lens simulator in order to invert in real time an\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nobserved gravitational lens mirage into its real source image. The resulting optimal gravitational\nlens telescope is thus simply composed of the cosmic gravitational lens producing the observed\ncosmic mirage, the observer's telescope and a coronagraphic lens inversion instrument placed at its\nfocus. Based upon the gravitational lens modelling of known resolved mirages, it should be straightforward to design the corresponding optical lens simulators associated with the mass distribution\nof the corresponding deflectors in order to directly invert the former ones at the telescope. The use\nof such ad-hoc instruments should allow one to directly re-image the real source at much fainter\nlevels as well as to detect even fainter background objects located behind and near the foreground\ndeflector(s). We have the aim to design and test in the near future such an instrument for the\ncase of the well resolved quintuply imaged quasar SDSS J1004 + 4112 at z = 1.734 produced by\na foreground cluster at z=0.68 (Inada et al. 2003; Liesenborgs et al. 2009). We also intend to test\nthe use of deformable mirrors as well as computer generated holograms in order to properly restore\nin the focal plane of the optimal gravitational lens telescope the real image source(s) of observed\ngravitational lens mirages.\nThe authors wish to dedicate the present work to the memory of Prof. Sjur Refsdal (19352009) who has been a pioneer in the field of gravitational lensing theory.
