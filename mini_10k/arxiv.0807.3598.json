For the excitation energy of 7940eV, the observed Fermi energy of Al\nshows a remarkable shift to higher binding energy as compared with that of Au, with accompanying\nbroadening. This is due to the recoil effect of the emitted photoelectrons. The observed spectra are\nwell reproduced by a simple model of Bloch electrons based on the isotropic Debye model.\nPACS numbers: 79.60.-i, 79.20.-m\n\nIn x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the emitted electron kicks the atom from which it is ejected in\naccordance with the conservation of momentum[1, 2, 3].\nThis gives rise to a loss of the kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectron. This effect is usually negligible because of the enormous mass difference between the atom\nand the electron, as long as the excitation energy is not\nvery large.@Quite recently, however, a clear evidence of\nrecoil effects has been found in the hard x-ray photoelectron spectra of graphite[4]. Under the excitation of\nthe core level by x-ray photons with energy of several\nkeV, the photoelectron spectra show a remarkable shift\nand broadening as compared to the case of excitation by\nsoft x-rays. Recoil effects of carbon 1s photoelectrons\nhave also been reported in CH4 molecules[5] and CF4\nmolecules[6], in this case as a recoil induced modification\nof vibrational structures.\nBased on a simple picture of an atom at rest in vacuum,\nthe recoil energy \u2206E imparted to the atom with mass M\nby a photoelectron with mass m and kinetic energy EK\nis estimated as\n\u2206E = EK \u00d7 (m/M ).\n\n(1)\n\nThis recoil energy \u2206E is observed as an apparent increase of the binding energy of the core electron. In\nsolids, the recoil energy is absorbed by the phonon bath,\nresulting in the excitation of phonons. Actually, the observed photoelectron spectra for C 1s in graphite have\nbeen well reproduced by an anisotropic Debye model[4],\nwhich takes into account solid state effects appropriate\nto graphite[7]. The recoil effects of the core electrons\nare characterized by the peak shift and the asymmetric broadening depending on the incident x-ray energy.\nSubsequently, such characteristic features have been observed in the core level XPS not only for 1s of graphite\nbut also in other materials such as Be 1s in Be metal, B\n1s in MgB2 and 2p level in Al metal[8]. The existence of\n\nremarkable recoil effects in the hard x-ray photoelectron\nspectra is now well established as far as the core level is\nconcerned.\nSimilar spectroscopic features of recoil effects have\nbeen observed in other fundamental processes such\nas elastic electron scattering[9, 10] and neutron\nscattering[11, 12].\nThese spectra can be understood essentially by the same principle of momentum\nconservation[13]. In contrast to the electron scattering\nand the neutron scattering, however, the photoelectron\nspectra tell us information on the specific electronic state\nfrom which the electron is ejected. A natural question\nthen arises: Are there any recoil effects in the photoelectron spectra for valence levels? Since the Bloch electrons\nin the valence bands are delocalized all over the crystal,\nit may be considered at first sight that the recoil momentum is shared by all the atoms of the crystal so that there\nwould be no observable recoil effect, just like the recoilless transition in the M\u00f6ssbauer effect[14]. In the present\nLetter, we show, for the first time, a clear evidence of the\nrecoil effect for conduction electrons in a simple metal.\nThe experimental data for XPS in the vicinity of the\nFermi-edge of Al indicate a remarkable shift and broadening depending on the excitation energy. The observed\nspectra are well reproduced by a theory which takes into\naccount the momentum conservation of the Bloch electrons expanded in a Wannier function basis.\nHigh resolution photoelectron spectroscopy of conduction electrons in the vicinity of the Fermi-edge was performed at SPring-8 using synchrotron radiation. Hard\nx-ray spectra at the excitation energy of 7940 eV and\nsoft x-ray spectra of 880eV were measured at the undulator beamlines BL29XU [15, 16] and BL17SU [17],\nrespectively, using hemispherical electron energy analyzers. The thick films of Au and Al on Cu substrates were\nprepared by evaporation in the UHV preparation chamber, and were directly transferred into the measurement\n\n\fIntensity (arb. units)\n\n2\nAl (Experiment)\nAu (Experiment)\nAl (Theory)\nAu (Theory)\nh\u03bd=7940eV\n\nT=20K\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\nBinding Energy (eV)\n\n-0.5\n\nFIG. 1: (color online) Photoelectron spectra near Fermiedge of Al (circles) and Au (squares) with excitation energy\n7940eV.

No signal from the substrate Cu or surface\ncontamination was observed in both hard and soft x-ray\nphotoelectron spectra. The energy scale of the spectra\nwere calibrated very accurately (<5 meV) by fitting the\nFermi-edge spectra of Au.\nFigure 1 shows the photoelectron spectra around the\nFermi-edge of Au (squares) and Al (circles) measured\nat 20K with the excitation energy of 7940 eV. The total instrumental energy resolution for both the spectra,\nas determined by the the beamline crystal monochromator and the electron energy analyzer, is the same. The\nbinding energy scale is calibrated by assuming that the\nrecoil energy in Au (M=197) is negligible. It is clear that\nthe Fermi-edge of Al (M=27) is shifted to higher binding energy. This shift is due to the kinetic energy loss of\nphotoelectron from the Fermi level in Al because of its\nlighter atomic mass compared to Au, and is an evidence\nof the recoil effect of Bloch electrons. Furthermore, the\nedge profile has a slightly larger slope for Al than for Au.\nConventional fitting analysis of these Fermi-edge profiles\nusing the Fermi-Dirac function (not shown) elucidates an\nenergy shift of 120 meV in Al relative to Au, and Gaussian widths of 160 meV for Al and 124 meV for Au. The\nbroadening of the width in Al is also a sign of the recoil\neffect, because the contribution of the instrumental energy resolution to the width is the same in these spectra.\nSoft x-ray spectra of Au (squares) and Al (circles) measured at 50K with the excitation energy of 880 eV are\nshown in Fig. 2. In the wide range spectra (Fig. 2(a)),\nit is difficult to recognize the difference between the Au\nand Al. However, in the expanded spectra (Fig. 2(b)),\nthe energy shift and the broadening of Fermi-edge profile\nis certainly observed. A fitting analysis clarifies a energy\nshift of 12 meV in Al relative to Au, and Gaussian width\nof 140 meV in Al and 118 meV in Au.\n~ in which a\nConsider the transition probabilty I(~k, K)\n\nBloch electron with wave vector ~k is emitted to the free\n~ by an x-ray photon\nelectron state with wave vector K\nwith energy h\u03bd. We neglect the momentum of the incident photon since it is an order of magnitude smaller\nthan that of the emitted electron in this energy region.\nWithout recoil effect, the component of the wave vector\nparallel to the surface is conserved in the periodic zone\nscheme. The perpendicular component is not conserved,\nbut is determined by the conservation of energy. @In the\npresence of recoil effect, it is written as\n\u01ebk + h\u03bd + \u01ebm = EK + \u01ebn ,\nin which \u01ebk is the energy of the Bloch electron measured\nfrom the vacuum level and \u01ebm and \u01ebn are the energies\nof the lattice vibrations in the initial state and the final\nstate, respectively.

The recoil effect, however, destroys the spatial coherence. The relative magnitude of the contribution to the total intensity of the\nterm i 6= 0 to that i = 0 is estimated much smaller than\nunity even for the terms corresponding to the nearest\nneighbor atoms in the region of hard x-ray. We can thus\nsafely neglect those terms as i 6= 0 in accordance with\nthe incoherent scattering approximation[18]. The angu~ disappears in the pholar dependence both for ~k and K\ntoelectron spectrum. By introducing the binding energy\n\u01eb for the initial state \u01eb = \u2212\u01ebk \u2212 \u03c6 with \u03c6 being the work\nfunction, and the apparent binding energy E defined by\nE = h\u03bd \u2212 EK \u2212 \u03c6, the photemission spectrum is written\nas\nZ \u221e\n1\ndtei(E\u2212\u01eb)t/~ F0 (t).\nI(\u01eb, E) =\n2\u03c0~ \u2212\u221e\nwhere the angular dependence of the emitted electrons is\naveraged in accordance with the experiment. The actual\n\n\f4\nspectrum is given by taking the average over the initial\ndistribution of the electrons,\nZ\nI(E) = I(\u01eb, E)f (\u03bc \u2212 \u01eb)D(\u01eb)d\u01eb,\n\u0001\nwhere f (\u01eb) = 1/ e(\u01eb\u2212\u03bc)/kB T + 1 is the Fermi distribution function with the chemical potential \u03bc, and D(\u01eb)\nis the density of state near the Fermi-edge which is approximated constant. Finally, we take into account the\nGaussian broadening due to the resolution of the apparatus.\nThe theoretical curves for the XPS with excitation\nenergy 7940eV are plotted in Fig.1 for Au (dotted\nline) and Al (solid line). The Debye energies are\n~\u03c9D (Al)=36.8meV and ~\u03c9D (Au)=14.2meV[19]. The\nboadening of the observed Fermi-edge profile originates\nfrom three factors; the temperature dependence of the\nFermi-Dirac function, the experimental resolution, and\nthe recoil effect. The broadening due to the experimental resolution is fixed to be 108meV (FWHM) by fitting\nthe line shape for Au. The effective coupling constant\nfor Al and Au are g = 4.3 and 1.5, respectively. In this\nfigure, the zero of the binding energy is chosen at the\nexperimental value of the chemical potential of Au. As\nshown in Fig.1, the agreement with the theoretical curves\nis good. The observed Fermi energy of Al is shifted by\n120meV as compared with that of Au due to the recoil effect. A simple estimation by using Eq.(1) gives the value\nof this shift to be 138meV. The quantum mechanical calculation based on the Debye model correctly reproduces\nthe experimental value. The reduction from 138meV to\n120meV is due to the quantum effect of phonons[4, 14].\nIt should be noted that, in the case of hard x-ray excitation with energy as high as 7940eV, even the observed\nFermi energy of Au is shifted about 24meV from the true\nvalue.\nIn Fig.2 (b), the results for the case with excitation energy 880eV are shown. The effective coupling constants\nfor Al and Au are g = 0.48 and 0.17, respectively, in this\ncase. Although the difference of the spectrum between\nAl and Au is small in this excitation energy, it does exist.\nIn this Letter, we have reported the modification of\nthe photoelectron spectra at the Fermi-edge due to the\nrecoil effect in simple metals. The existence of the photoelectron recoil effect means that the electron is coupled\nwith the crystal lattice, and the wave function of the\nelectron follows adiabatically the atomic motion. Therefore, it is a little surprising that the Bloch electron in\nthe valence band of Al, which is a typical material where\nthe nearly free-electron picture works well[20], shows remarkable recoil effects. As shown above, Bloch's theorem\nitself guarantees the dependence of the wave function on\nthe lattice coordinates. The recoil effect directly follows\nfrom this fact as a kinematic effect. The finding of recoil\neffects in the Bloch electrons indicates a new spectroscopic aspect in the XPS, and due care must be taken\n\nto interpret changes at and near the Fermi level when\nusing hard x-rays. The magnitude of the recoil effect depends essentially on the mass of the component atoms,\nas shown in Fig.1. Since the photoelctron spectra reflect\nalso the nature of the electronic state in the initial state,\nthe XPS recoil effect in the valence levels of composite\nmaterials poses an interesting problem. If the material\nis composed of atoms with big mass differences, and if\nthe valence levels are made of hybridized orbitals originating in specific atomic species, the modification of the\nphotoelectron spectra will depend on the local density of\nstate of the level. The experimental and the theoretical\nstudy of such effects is left for future works.\nThis work was partially supported by the Grant-inAid for Scientific Research (B) from Japan Society for\nthe Promotion of Science (No. 20340079).\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n\n[5]\n\n[6]\n\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n\nElectronic address: E-mail: takatay@spring8.or.jp\nElectronic address: E-mail: kayanuma@pe.osakafu-u.ac.jp\nC.
