In\nthe space of all quadratic systems, the systems with a center form a union of four\nirreducible affine algebraic sets :\n\u2022 Hamiltonian (QH\n3 )\n\u2022 reversible (QR\n3)\n\u2022 generalized Lotka-Volterra (QLV\n3 )\n1\n\n\f\u2022 codimension-four set (Q4 )\n(the subscripts indicate the co-dimension of each algebraic subset), see \u017bola\u0327dek [11]\nfor a modern proof. Strictly speaking, the above classification concerns only the centers themselves. There are quadratic systems with two centers, one of them in QR\n3\nLV\nand the other in QR\n\u2229\nQ\n,\nsee\n[7],\np.\n148.\nIn\nthe\npresent\npaper\nwe\nare\ninterested\n3\n3\nin the maximal number of limit cycles which can emerge from the periodic orbits of\na quadratic system with a center, after a small quadratic perturbation. The corresponding number is the cyclicity of the related open period annulus. A quadratic\ncenter is said to be generic, if it does not belong simultaneously to two of the above\nalgebraic sets. The cyclicity of the period annulus of a generic center depends on\nthe number of the zeros of the first Poincar\u00e9-Pontryagin-Melnikov function, while in\nthe general case a higher-order analysis is needed. The corresponding higher-order\nfunctions were determined in Iliev [7].\nThe cyclicity of the open annuli in the generic Lotka-Volterra case (QLV\n3 ) has been\nstudied by \u017bola\u0327dek [11], and in the generic Hamiltonian case (QH\n)\nby\nHorozov-Iliev\n[6]\n3\nand Gavrilov [4] (for the codimension-one generic cases from the bifurcation diagram\nof QH\n3 see [1] and the references therein). Almost nothing is known about the generic\nreversible case (QR\n3 ) and nothing about the generic codimension-four one (Q4 ). In\nthe present paper we place an upper bound on the cyclicity of the (unique) period\nannulus in the generic codimension four case (Q4 ).\nTheorem 1. The cyclicity of the open period annulus surrounding the center of any\ngeneric codimension-four plane quadratic system is less than or equal to eight.\nThe conjectural exact upper bound, as it is well known, is three [11, 7]. To\nthe end of this Introduction we briefly sketch our proof. A codimension-four plane\nquadratic system with a center has a well known rational first integral H. Using\nthis one may check that the generic complexified orbit {(x, y) \u2208 C2 : H(x, y) = h}\nof the system is an affine elliptic curve, and the corresponding Poincar\u00e9-PontryaginMelnikov function I = I(h) is a complete elliptic integral on it. This remarkable fact\n(it seems to have gone unnoticed by the specialists) is the starting point of the paper.\nStill, a direct application of standard techniques like in [10, 9, 6, 3, 4] does not work.\nIndeed, the Poincar\u00e9-Pontryagin-Melnikov function involves differential of the third\nkind with residues algebraic in the parameter h (and not only polynomial, as in the\nusual cases). On the other hand, it turns out that I satisfies a Picard-Fuchs equation\nof the form\nM2 \u25e6 L2 \u25e6 L1 (I) = 0\nd\nin which L1 = h dh\n\u2212 1 and L2 , M2 are suitable second-order Picard-Fuchs differential\noperators. The role of L1 and L2 in our approach is to annihilate the residues of\nthe differentials involved in I. It is easy to see that I has at most as many zeros as\nG = L1 (I) on the interval of consideration. We shall prove further that the solution\nspace of L2 is a Chebyshev space (Proposition 14). This on its turn implies that if\nR is a function with k zeros, then each solution G of the non-homogeneous equation\nL2 (G) = R has at most k + 2 zeros (Proposition 2). As R = L2 \u25e6 L1 (I) = L2 (G) is in\nthe kernel of the second-order Picard-Fuchs operator M2 , it remains to show that R\n\n2\n\n\fhas at most 6 zeros which is achieved in a standard way by making use of the Petrov\nmethod [10], see Proposition 4.\n\n2\n\nRemarks about the codimension-four case\n\nIn complex coordinate z = x+iy, the system corresponding to the generic codimensionfour case with a center placed at the origin becomes\n\u017c = \u2212iz + 4z 2 + 2|z|2 + \u03b1z\u0304 2 ,\n\n\u03b1 \u2208 C \\ R,\n\n|\u03b1| = 2.\n\nIt is well known that the codimension-four case has a first integral of the form\nH(x, y) =\n\n[\u03c6(x, y)]2\n[\u03c8(x, y)]3\n\nwhere \u03c6 and \u03c8 are polynomials of degree tree and two, respectively. Taking \u03b1 = b+ic\nand denoting for short\nY = cx \u2212 (2 + b)y,\n\n\u03ba=\n\n4\n> 1,\n2+b\n\none can easily find the explicit form of the first integral, namely\n[8y(1 + Y ) \u2212 32 (1 + \u03baY 3 )]2\n.\nH=\n[1 \u2212 8y + \u03baY 2 ]3\nTherefore, \u03c6 = 0 defines a trident curve and \u03c8 = 0 is a parabola. Since \u03c6(0, 0) = \u2212 23 ,\n\u03c8(0, 0) = 1, the period annulus around the center is placed inside the domain \u03a9\ndetermined by \u03c6 < 0 < \u03c8. Taking X 2 = \u03c8 = 1 \u2212 8y + \u03baY 2 , X > 0, then in\n(x\u0304, \u0233) = (X, Y ) coordinates, the system has in \u03a9 a first integral of the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 3\n1\nx\u0304\u22123\n2\n2\n2\n.\n(1)\n\u03ba\u0233 + \u03ba\u0233 + (1 \u2212 x\u0304 )\u0233 \u2212 x\u0304 +\nH(x\u0304, \u0233) =\n8(2 \u2212 b) 3\n3\n(Compare to [7], where an additional rotation of the very initial coordinates takes\nplace). Although the change of the variables\n(x, y) 7\u2192 (x\u0304, \u0233)\ndoes not define a bi-rational projective transformation (but a double ramified covering), it induces a bi-rational map\n{(x, y) :\n\n[\u03c6(x, y)]2\n= t} \u2192 {(x\u0304, \u0233) : H(x\u0304, \u0233) = t}\n[\u03c8(x, y)]3\n\nIt is seen that the level sets of the first integral H(x\u0304, \u0233) are cubic plane curves and\nhence they are (generically) elliptic.\n3\n\n\fFor convenience, from now on, the bars over the variables x, y will be omitted.\nThe generating function I(t), whose zeroes correspond to limit cycles in the perturbed\nsystem, are given by the following complete elliptic integral (cf. [7], Theorem 2 (iii))\nZZ\nI(t) =\nx\u22126 [\u03bc1 + \u03bc2 y + \u03bc3 y 3 + \u03bc4 (\u03ba2 y 4 \u2212 x4 )]dxdy.\n(2)\nH(x,y)<t\n\nOur main purpose in this paper is to study how many zeroes the integral I(t) can\nhave in the open interval corresponding to the period annulus around (1, 0).\n\n3\n\nPicard-Fuchs systems\n\nIn this section we derive several equations satisfied by the entries of (2). We also\napply several reductions to express these integrals in the form we need. In particular,\nwe calculate explicitly G, L2 and R we mentioned in the introduction.\nWe begin by introducing new variables y = y1 \u2212 1, h = 8(2 \u2212 b)t. Then the\nequation H(x, y) = t where H is given by (1) becomes (we will omit the subscript in\ny1 )\n2\n\u03ba\n(3)\nH(x, y, h) = y 3 \u2212 x2 y \u2212 hx3 \u2212 (\u03ba \u2212 1)y + (\u03ba \u2212 1) = 0.\n3\n3\nBy using (3), it is not hard to verify that the period annulus around the center at\n(1, 1) corresponds to the levels h from the interval (\u2212 32 , \u2212 3\u221a2 \u03ba ).\nLet us denote for i, j \u2208 Z\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZZ\n2\n2\ni j\n.\nIi,j (h) =\nx y dxdy, h \u2208 \u2212 , \u2212 \u221a\n3 3 \u03ba\nH(x,y,h)<0\nThen multiplying (3) by xi y j+1dx, respectively by xi+1 y j dy and integrating, we obtain\nthe identities\n\u03ba\n(j + 4)Ii,j+3 \u2212 (j + 2)Ii+2,j+1 \u2212 h(j + 1)Ii+3,j\n(4)\n3\n2\n\u2212(\u03ba \u2212 1)(j + 2)Ii,j+1 + (\u03ba \u2212 1)(j + 1)Ii,j = 0,\n3\n\u03ba\n(i + 1)Ii,j+3 \u2212 (i + 3)Ii+2,j+1 \u2212 h(i + 4)Ii+3,j\n(5)\n3\n2\n\u2212(\u03ba \u2212 1)(i + 1)Ii,j+1 + (\u03ba \u2212 1)(i + 1)Ii,j = 0.\n3\nMultiplying (4) by i + 4 and (5) by j + 1 and subtracting, we come to\n\u03ba(i + j + 5)Ii,j+3 \u2212 (i + j + 5)Ii+2,j+1 \u2212 (\u03ba \u2212 1)(i + 3j + 7)Ii,j+1 + 2(\u03ba \u2212 1)(j + 1)Ii,j = 0.\nIn particular, for i = \u22126 and j = 1 one obtains I\u22126,2 = I\u22126,1 .

Below, we shall use the explicit\nformulas for G, R, L2 just derived in order to prove our main result.\n\n6\n\n\f4\n\nProof of Theorem 1\n\nThe proof of Theorem 1 follows from the next four Propositions, the first two of\nthem being probably known. Let V be a finite-dimensional vector space of functions,\nreal-analytic on an open interval (a, b).\nDefinition 1. We say that V is a Chebyshev space, provided that each non-zero\nfunction in V has at most dim(V ) \u2212 1 zeros, counted with multiplicity.\nLet S be the solutions space of a second-order linear analytic differential equation\nx\u2032\u2032 + a1 (t)x\u2032 + a2 (t)x = 0\n\n(12)\n\non an open interval (a, b).\nProposition 1. The solution space S of (12) is a Chebyshev space on the interval\n(a, b) if and only if there exists a nowhere vanishing solution x0 \u2208 S (x0 (t) 6= 0,\n\u2200t \u2208 (a, b)).\nRemark 1. The question of existence of a non-vanishing solution is a recurrent\nquestion in many papers concerning zeros of Abelian integrals, see e.g. [9, 5, 2]. A\nChebyshev space V in our sense is sometimes called an extended Chebyshev space, and\nit is said to be an extended complete Chebyshev space, provided that it has a complete\nflag of extended Chebyshev sub-spaces, see e.g. [8]. In the case when dim(V ) = 2\nthe Chebyshev space V (in our sense) is an extended complete Chebyshev one if and\nonly if it has a nowhere vanishing function. Therefore the notions of Chebyshev space\n(in our sense) and extended complete Chebyshev space (in the sense of [8]), as far as\napplied to the solution space of (12), coincide.\nProposition 2. Suppose the solution space of the homogeneous equation (12) is a\nChebyshev space and let R be an analytic function on (a, b) having k zeros (counted\nwith multiplicity). Then every solution x(t) of the non-homogeneous equation\nx\u2032\u2032 + a1 (t)x\u2032 + a2 (t)x = R(t)\n\n(13)\n\nhas at most k + 2 zeros on (a, b).\nProposition 3. The solution space S associated to the differential operator\nL2 (h) = 5\u03bah \u2212 (9\u03bah2 \u2212 8)\n\nd\nd2\n+ h(9\u03bah2 \u2212 4) 2 ,\ndh\ndh\n\n\u03ba>1\n\n(14)\n\nis a Chebyshev system on the interval (\u2212\u221e, \u2212 3\u221a2 \u03ba ).\nd\nLet R = L2 \u25e6 L1 (I), where I is the Abelian integral (9) and L1 = h dh\n\u2212 1. A\nsuitable for our purposes expression for R is obtained in (11).\n\nProposition 4. The Abelian integral R(h) has at most 6 zeros (counted with multiplicity) on the interval (\u2212 23 , \u2212 3\u221a2 \u03ba ), \u03ba > 1.\n7\n\n\fProof of Theorem 1, assuming Propositions 1-4. The Abelian integral L1 (I),\nI given by (9), is a solution of the non-homogeneous equation L2 (G) = R. According\nto Proposition 4, Proposition 3 and Proposition 2 the integral L1 (I)(h) has at most\n8 zeros on the interval (\u2212\u221e, \u2212 3\u221a2 \u03ba ). The integral I(h) has the same number of zeros\nas L1 (I)(h) on the same interval. Finally, the functions (9), (8), (6) and (2) have the\nsame number of zeros in the respective intervals. \u0003\nTo the end of the paper we prove the above Propositions 1-4.\nProof of Proposition 1. Let (x1 , x2 ) be a fundamental set of solutions of (12) and\nconsider the map\np : (a, b) \u2192 S 1 = P1 R : t 7\u2192 [x1 (t) : x2 (t)].\nAs the Wronskian of x1 , x2 is non-vanishing, then the map p is non-degenerate (dp(t) 6=\n0) and hence monotonous.\nThe solution space of (12) is Chebyshev if and only if the map p is injective. The\nsolution space of (12) contains a nowhere vanishing solution if and only if the map p\nis not surjective.\nAs the circle is not homeomorphic to an open interval, then the monotonous differentiable map p cannot be surjective and injective at the same time. It follows that\nif p is injective then it is not surjective. If, on the contrary, p is not surjective, then\nthe monotonicity of p implies that the image of (a, b) under p is an open subinterval\nof S 1 and p is injective. \u0003\nProof of Proposition 2. Let (x1 , x2 ) be a fundamental set of solutions of (12), such\nthat x1 (t) is a nowhere vanishing solution. The change of the variables x \u2192 x/x1 (t)\ndoes not change the number of the zeros of the solutions of (12), which is transformed\nto a linear equation with a fundamental system of solutions {1, xx21 (t)\n}. As the vector\n(t)\nspace spanned by x1 , x2 is Chebyshev, then the function\n\nx2 (t)\nis strictly monotonous\nx1 (t)\n(t)\nis therefore regular\n= xx12 (t)\n\non (a, b). The change of the independent variable t \u2192 \u03c4\nand transforms further the above linear equation to an equation with a fundamental\nsystem of solutions {1, \u03c4 }. Therefore the corresponding differential operator is a\n2\nmultiple of d\u03c4d 2 . More precisely, the regular change of variables\n(x, t) 7\u2192 (y, \u03c4 ),\n\ny=\n\nx\n,\nx1 (t)\n\n\u03c4=\n\nx2 (t)\nx1 (t)\n\ntransforms equation (13) to\nx1\n\n\u0012\n\nd x2 (t)\ndt x1 (t)\n\n\u00132\n\nd2\ny = R(t(\u03c4 ))\nd\u03c4 2\n\nand hence each solution of the non-homogeneous equation (13) has at most k + 2\nzeros on (a, b) (counted with multiplicity). \u0003\n\n8\n\n\fProof of Proposition 3. Let {\u03b4(h) : h \u2208 (\u2212 23 , \u2212 3\u221a2 \u03ba )} be the continuous family of\nR\nperiodic orbits defined by {H = h}, with H in the form (7). Then G(h) = \u03b4(h) \u03c9\nwhere \u03c9 is a linear combination of elliptic differentials of the first and second kind.\nTherefore the residues of \u03c9 are solutions of L2 . The only residues of \u03c9 are at (0, y)\nwhere y is one of the roots of \u03ba3 y 3 \u2212 y = h and they are easily computed:\nRes(0,y) \u03c9 =\n\n\u22124h + (3\u03bah2 \u2212 4)y\n.\n\u03bay 2 \u2212 1\n\nFor h < \u2212 3\u221a2 \u03ba the polynomial \u03ba3 y 3 \u2212 y \u2212 h has one real root which we denote by y0 .\nWe shall show that the solution f (h) = Res(0,y0 ) \u03c9 of L2 x = 0 does not vanish in the\ninterval (\u2212\u221e, \u2212 3\u221a2 \u03ba ). Indeed, on this interval y0 (h) is a strictly increasing function\nq\nand y0 (h) < \u2212 \u03ba5 = y0 (\u2212 3\u221a2 \u03ba ). It remains to show that \u22124h + (3\u03bah2 \u2212 4)y0 6= 0.\nThe identity\n\u03ba\n4\n\u22124h + (3\u03bah2 \u2212 4)y0 = \u22124( y03 \u2212 y0 ) + (3\u03bah2 \u2212 4)y0 = \u03bah(3h2 \u2212 y02 )\n3\n3\nimplies that f (h) = 0 on (\u2212\u221e, \u2212 3\u221a2 \u03ba ) if and only if h = 2y0 /3. Now\n2\n\u03ba 3\ny0 \u2212 y0 = h = y0\n3\n3\nq\ngives y0 = \u00b1 \u03ba5 . But y0 = y0 (h) is a strictly increasing function in (\u2212\u221e, \u2212 3\u221a2 \u03ba ]\nq\n2\n\u221a\nand y0 (\u2212 3 \u03ba ) = \u2212 \u03ba5 which is the needed contradiction. Thus the solution space of\n\nL on (\u2212\u221e, \u2212 3\u221a2 \u03ba ) contains a nowhere vanishing function and hence is a Chebyshev\nsystem. \u0003\n2\nThe above result cannot be improved, as shown by the example L = dtd 2 .\n\nProof of Proposition 4. According to (11), it suffices to show that any linear com\u2032\n\u2032\nbination of the form P3 (h2 )I0,0\n(h)+Q2 (h2 )I1,1\n(h) where P3 , Q2 are real polynomials of\n\u2032\n\u2032\ndegree at most three and two, has at most 6 zeros. We note that I0,0\n, I1,1\nare complete\nelliptic integrals of the first and second kind respectively, satisfying the second-order\nPicard-Fuchs system (10).\np\nWe introduce a new variable s \u2208 (1, \u03ba) through h = \u2212 23 s/\u03ba and denote by dot\n\u2032\nthe differentiation with respect to s. Also, denote for a convenience J1 (s) = I0,0\n(h(s)),\n\u2032\nJ2 (s) = I1,1 (h(s)). By (14) and (11), we obtain the equation\n\u0014\n\u0015\nd2\nP3 (s)J1 (s) + Q2 (s)J2 (s)\n1 d\n5\nL2 G \u2261 s(1 \u2212 s) 2 \u2212\nG(s) =\n\u2212\n.\nds\n2 ds 36\n(s \u2212 \u03ba)2 (s \u2212 1)\nHence, we will need information about the zeroes of the right-hand side in the interval\n(1, \u03ba) \u2282 (1, \u221e). Equation (10) implies that J(s) = (J1 (s), J2 (s))\u22a4 satisfies the system\nof hypergeometric type\n!\n1\u2212s \u03ba\u22121\n \u0307\nJ(s) = 6\nJ(s)\n1\u2212s s\u22121\n9\n\n\for equivalently\n1\u2212s \u03ba\u22121\n\n \u0307\n6(s \u2212 1)(s \u2212 \u03ba)J(s)\n=\n\n1\u2212s s\u22121\n\n!\n\nJ(s)\n\n(15)\n\nLet us consider for any n \u2208 N the vector space\n\nVn = {Pn .J1 + Qn\u22121 .J2 : Pn , Qn\u22121 \u2208 R[h],\n\ndeg Pm , Qm \u2264 m}.\n\nProposition 4 follows from the following more general result.\nProposition 5. The vector space Vn is Chebyshev on the interval (1, \u03ba) : each element\nhas at most dim Vn \u2212 1 = 2n zeros (counted with multiplicity).\nProof of Proposition 5. We use the Petrov method in the complex domain D =\nC \\ (\u2212\u221e, 1), see [10, 9]. The characteristic exponents of (15) at 1, \u03ba, \u221e are equal to\n{0, 0}, {0, 0}, {\u2212 61 , 61 }, respectively. The function Pn .J1 + Qn\u22121 .J2 is holomorphic in\na neighborhood of s = \u03ba (this value corresponds to the center of the system dH = 0,\nwith H the symmetric Hamiltonian given by (7)), and has a logarithmic singularity\nin a neighborhood of s = 1 (which corresponds to the saddle point of the symmetric\nHamiltonian system). The function J1 is a complete elliptic integral of the first kind\nand therefore does not vanish. Consider the function\nF (s) =\n\nPn (s).J1 (s) + Qn\u22121 (s).J2 (s)\nJ1 (s)\n\nwhich is real-analytic in the complex domain D. We apply the argument principle to\nthe smaller domain\n1\nD\u03b5 = D \u2229 {s : |s \u2212 1| > \u03b5} \u2229 {s : |s| < }.\n\u03b5\nFor this purpose, we consider the increase (or decrease) of the argument of F when s\nmakes one turn along the boundary of D\u03b5 in a positive direction. The following facts\nare easily deduced from the asymptotic expansions of J near the singular points of\nthe Fuchs system (15).\n1. Along the boundary of the small disc {|s \u2212 1| = \u03b5} the increase of the argument\nof F is bounded by a value close to zero.\n2. Along the boundary of the big disc {|s| = 1\u03b5 } the increase of the argument of F\nis bounded by a value close to 2\u03c0 n = 2\u03c0 max{n, n \u2212 1 + 62 }.\n3. Along the interval (\u2212\u221e, 1), the imaginary part of F equals\nQn\u22121 (s) Im\n\ndet W (s)\nJ2 (s)\n= Qn\u22121 (s)\nJ1 (s)\n|J1 (s)|2\n\nwhere\nW (s) =\n\nJ1 (s) J \u03031 (s)\nJ2 (s) J \u03032 (s)\n\nis a fundamental matrix of (15).\n10\n\n!\n\n\f4. The determinant of the fundamental matrix W is a rational function in s and\nin fact a non-zero constant.\nSumming up the above facts we conclude that the increase of the argument of F\nalong the boundary of D\u03b5 is bounded by 2n. Therefore F , and hence Pn (s).J1 (s) +\nQn\u22121 (s).J2 (s) has at most 2n zeros (counted with multiplicity) in D, and hence in\n(1, \u03ba). Proposition 5, and hence Proposition 4 are proved. \u0003\nThis also finishes the proof of Theorem 1.\nAcknowledgment.
