This happens when there is\nanother non-linear field present, besides the error field multipoles, which\nproduces a strong enough dependence of the tune on the amplitude of the\nparticle motion. Non-linear fields that produce a dependence of the tune\non the ampliude can be the quadrupole fringe field , space charge fields and\noctupole correctors. In some cases it may be advantageous to introduce a\nnon-linear field that produces a dependence of the tune on the amplitude\nof the particle motion. In order to be able to measure the strength of the\nisland resonance, and then to correct it, it is helpful to study how these\nresonances show themselves. In particular , one can study how the presence\n1\n\n\fpx vs x, 3nux=19 resonance\n0.01\n\npx\n\n0.005\n\n0\n\n-0.005\n\n-0.01\n-0.06\n\n-0.04\n\n-0.02\n\n0\nx\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\nm\n\nFigure 1: px vs. x for the 3\u03bdx = 19 resonance excited by a random b2 in the SNS magnets.

In the figure x0,px0,y0,py0,epx0,ept0,nux0,nuy0 represent x0 , px0 , y0 , py0 , \u01ebx0 , \u01eby0 , \u01ebt0 , \u03bdx0 , \u03bdy0 .\nthe tune to increase with the amplitude . Starting with a zero amplitude\ntune of \u03bdx = 6.3267 , 3\u03bdx = 19 \u2212 .02, one finds the phase space plot shown\nin Fig. 1. This plot was generated starting with x0 = 24mm, px0 = 0\nand then increasing x0 in steps of 2 mm keeping px0 = 0 and tracking the\nparticle for 1000 turns for each x0 . The tune starts below the resonance,\nand increases with amplitude. The islands appear when the tune reaches\n\u03bdx = 6.3333. The islands are reached when the initial amplitude is increased\nto x0 = 30mm, px0 = 0, which corresponds to an initial horizontal emittance\nof about \u01ebx0 = 115 mm.mrad.\nThe distortion of the tune dependence on amplitude is shown in Fig. 2\nwhere the horizontal tune is plotted against \u01ebx0 . Fig. 2 is generated by doing\na search along the px0 = 0 direction, increasing x0 in steps of 2 mm. Fig. 2\nshows a flat region where \u03bdx = 6.3333 which will be seen to indicate the\nregion where x0 , px0 is crossing the island. When x0 , px0 are inside the island,\nthe paticle motion is doing a slow oscilation around the fixed point at the\ncenter of the island. The particle motion then contains more than one tune,\nand the tune with the largest ampltude is the tune of the fixed point, 6.3333.\nInside the island, the tune shown in Fig. 2, is this tune with the largest\n4\n\n\famplitude. One can verify that the beginning and the end of the flat region\noccur at the same \u01ebx0 which correpond to the borders of the islands along the\npx0 = 0 direction. Fig. 2 can be used to find the width of the island along\nthe px0 = 0 direction which is given by the width of the flat region in Fig. 2.\nThe islands generated by the 3\u03bdx = 19 resonance indicate a growth in\nthe particle emittance. If one starts a particle inside the islands with the\ninitial emittance \u01ebx0 , then as the particle moves around the fixed point, its\nemittance will change and reach the maximun value of \u01ebx,max . One can use\nas a measure of the emittance growth the quantity\nd\u01ebx,max = (\u01ebx,max \u2212 \u01ebx0 )/\u01ebx0\n. d\u01ebx,max is plotted against \u01ebx0 in Fig. 3. It shows a maximun value for d\u01ebx,max\nwhich can be used as a measure of the strength of the resonance.\nThe results shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 can to some extent be measured\nexperimentally to find a way to correct this resonance with sextupole correctors. An interesting plot that may corrrespond more closely to something\nthat might be measured is to plot the emittance growth, d\u01ebx,max vs the tune,\n\u03bdx . This plot can be found by combining Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 and is shown in\nFig. 4. In this plot, there is a peak in the emittance growth which occurs\nwhen \u03bdx =6.3333, the resonance tune. The peak could be used as a measure\nof the resonance strength to correct the resonance.\nUsing the flat region in the tune dependence on amplitude along the\npx0 = 0 direction to indicate the strength of the resonance can sometimes\nlead to an error in setting the strengths of the sextupole correctors. Changing\nthe strength of the correctors can cause the islands to move, and the width\nof the island as indicated by the flat region in the tune dependence on the\namplitude may, for example, appear smaller because one is now crossing the\nisland at a place where it is narrower. Also, when the islands move the the\nemittance growth , d\u01ebx,max may seem smaller. In order to avoid this error\ndue to the movement of the islands when the corrector strengths are changed,\none has to measure the tune dependence on amplitude along enough different\ndirections in phase space so that one finds the largest width of the island and\nthe largest emittance growth for the x0 , px0 inside the island. The same sort\nof argument also applies in finding the emittance growth dependence on the\namplitude. In Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, results are given found by going out along\nmany directions in phase space. One needs just enough directions to cover\none of the three islands in Fig. 1. Here 6 directions were used in the region\nof phase space covered by one island.\n5\n\n\fnux vs. epxo, 3nux=19 resonance\n6.339\n6.338\n6.337\n6.336\nnux\n\n6.335\n6.334\n6.333\n6.332\n6.331\n6.33\n6.329\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n200\nepx0 mm.mrad.\n\n250\n\n300\n\nFigure 5: \u03bdx vs \u01ebx0 for the 3\u03bdx = 19 resonance excited by a random b2 in the SNS magnets.\nThe initial coordinates x0 , px0 lie\nalong 6 directions in the x0 , px0 phase space and \u01eby0 = 0 .\u03bdx0 =\n6.3267, \u03bdy0 = 6.2267.

In the same way, Fig. 6 now\nshows the largest emittance growth for the x0 , px0 that are inside the island.\nIn applying the above results to develope a procedure for using the correctors to correct a resonance, one will probably use a sample of the x0 , px0\nthat is convenient for a particular ring and its injection system. One would\nthen measure either the tune or the emittance growth of enough particles in\nthe sample to be able to find the width of the island from the tune measurement or the largest emittance growth for paticles in the sample. One has to\nhave a large enough sample that one is not misled by the movement of the\nislands when the excitation of the correctors are changed. To measure the\nlargest emittance growth for particles in the sample, one can measure the frequency spectrum of the betatron oscillations. Particles inside an island will\nhave the frequency that corresponds to the resonant tune 6.3333.

Something like this\nwas done at RHIC [2]. The measurements can be done for a weak beam (no\nspace charge effects) as it has been shown [3] that the resonance correction\nfor resonances generated by magnet errors in the absence of space charge will\nalso work fairly well in the presence of space charge.\nAn interesting plot that may corrrespond more closely to something that\nmight be measured is to plot the emittance growth, d\u01ebx,max vs the tune, \u03bdx .\nThis plot can be found by combining Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 and is shown in Fig. 7\nThe correction of the island resonances for the 3\u03bdx = 19 example can be\ndone with two sextupole correctors properly located around the ring.The two\ncorrectors can then be adjusted one at a time, and for each setting of the\ncorrectors, the island width can measured from the dependnce of the tune\non the amplitude as shown in Fig. 5, or the dependence of the amplitude\ngrowth on the tune as shown by combining Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. Simulating\nthis procedure gives the results shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9. The emittance\ngrowth ,the maximun depx,max, is reduced by almost a factor of 10 by the\nbest setting of the correctors that was found.\n8\n\n\fdepx,max vs. epxo, 3nux=19 resonance\n0.14\n0.12\n\ndepx,max\n\n0.1\n0.08\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n200\nepx0 mm.mrad.\n\n250\n\n300\n\nFigure 9: d\u01ebx,max vs \u01ebx0 for the 3\u03bdx = 19 resonance excited by a random b2 in\nthe SNS magnets and corrected using two sextupole correctors.

According to the theoretical result\nthe required setting of the correctors does not depend on the field producing\nthe dependence of the tune on amplitude. This result is not useful for setting\nthe correctors as the errors in the magnets are not known. However, this\nresult helps to explain why the setting of the correctors in the absence of\nspace charge fields will also correct the resonance when the space charge\nfields are present. It was found for the 3\u03bdx = 19 resonance that setting of\nthe correctors to make d\u03bd30 =0 will only reduce the emittance growth, the\nmaximun d\u01ebx,max , by a factor of about 3 instead of the factor of 10 found\nabove. It was found that for the SNS [3] this weaker correction that makes\nd\u03bd30 =0 was good enough to reduce the beam losses due to the resonance and\nspace charge fields.\n\n9\n\n\fdept vs. epxo, nux+2nuy=19 resonance\n0.5\n0.45\n0.4\n\ndept\n\n0.35\n0.3\n0.25\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\nept0 mm.mrad.\n\nFigure 10: The emittance spread d\u01ebt vs \u01ebt0 for the \u03bdx + 2\u03bdy = 19\nresonance excited by a random b2 in the SNS magnets .

This resonance is driven by the random error sextupole, b2 , in\nthe magnets. Unlike, the 3\u03bdx = 19 resonance in 2-dimensional phase space, it\nis difficult to visualise the islands associated with the \u03bdx +2\u03bdy = 19 resonance\nby looking at the particle motion in 4-dimensional phase space. Instead, we\nwill look at the distortion due to the resonance on the dependence of the\ntune and the emittance growth on the amplitude of the particle motion. In\nFig. 10, the spread in total emittance ,\nd\u01ebt = (\u01ebt,max \u2212 \u01ebt,min )/(\u01ebt,max + \u01ebt,min )\nis plotted against the initial total emittance, \u01ebt0 . \u01ebt,max is the largest total\nemittance and \u01ebt,min is the smallest total emittance reached by particle with\nthe initial coordinates, x0 , px0, y0 , py0 , and initial total emittance, \u01ebt0 ,tracked\nfor 1000 turns. Points were found along a particular direction in phase space\ngiven by px0 = 0, py0 = 0 and \u01ebx = \u01eby .The emittance spread becomes large\n10\n\n\fin the region \u01ebt0 =125 to \u01ebt0 =300, and this region may be used as a measure\nof the width of the island along this particular direction , px0 = 0, py0 = 0\nand \u01ebx = \u01eby . The low value of d\u01ebt near the center of region shows that this\nparticular direction goes close to the center of the island where we expect\nd\u01ebt =0. Fig. 11 shows the emittance growth,\nd\u01ebt,max = (\u01ebt,max \u2212 \u01ebt0 )/\u01ebt0\nas a function of \u01ebt0 . The goal of a correction scheme would be to reduce\nthe maximun value of d\u01ebt,max in ths plot. In the 2-dimensional case of the\n3\u03bdx = 19 resonance, the plot of \u03bdx vs. \u01ebx0 had a flat region where \u03bdx had the\nconstant value of 6.3333 which gave the width of the island. It was found\nfor the \u03bdx + 2\u03bdy = 19 resonance, a flat region would be found if we plotted\n\u03bdx + 2\u03bdy vs. \u01ebt0 and the constant value in the flat region is \u03bdx + 2\u03bdy = 19.\nThis is shown in Fig. 12. The width of the flat region coincides with the\nwidth of the island as found from Fig. 10, which plots the emittance spread\nvs. \u01ebt0 . For coupled motion, the particle motion contains more than one\ntune, and what is plotted in Fig. 12 is the main tune or the tune with the\nlargest amplitude.\nAn interesting plot that may corrrespond more closely to something that\nmight be measured is to plot the emittance growth, d\u01ebt,max vs \u03bdx + 2\u03bdy .\nThis plot can be found by combining Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 and is shown in\nFig. 13. In this plot, there is a peak in the emittance growth which occurs\nwhen \u03bdx + 2\u03bdy = 19. The peak could be used as a measure of the resonance\nstrength to correct the resonance.\nAs in the 2-dimesional case, to correct the \u03bdx + 2\u03bdy = 19 resonance , one\nhas to repeat the above calculations for all directions in phase space that\npass through a particular island, in order not to be misled by the movement\nof the islands when the correctors are changed. These results are shown in\nFig. 14, Fig. 15.and Fig. 16 where for each \u01ebt0 runs are done for 6 directions\nin x0 , px0 and for 6 directions in y0 , py0 . In these figures there are, then, 36\npoints for each value of \u01ebt0 . The results indicated by these figures for the\nwidth of the island and the maximun emittance growth are not too different\nfrom those found above where only one direction in phase space was used, as\nthe particular direction used appears to pass close to the center of the island.\nAn interesting plot that may corrrespond more closely to something that\nmight be measured is to plot the emittance growth , d\u01ebt,max vs \u03bdx + 2\u03bdy .\nThis plot can be found by combining Fig. 15 and Fig. 16 and is shown in\n11\n\n\fdept,max vs. epxo, nux+2nuy=19 resonance\n1.8\n1.6\n\nd e p t ,m a x\n\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\nept0 mm.mrad.\n\nFigure 11: The emittance sgrowth d\u01ebt,max vs \u01ebt0 for the \u03bdx + 2\u03bdy = 19\nresonance excited by a random b2 in the SNS magnets .

In this plot, there is a peak in the emittance growth which occurs\nwhen \u03bdx + 2\u03bdy = 19. The peak could be used as a measure of the resonance\nstrength to correct the resonance.\nThe correction of the island resonances for the \u03bdx + 2\u03bdy = 19 resonance\ncan be done with two sextupole correctors properly located around the ring.\nAssuming that one has a way to measure either the width of the island or\nthe maximun emittance growth using the above results as a guide , then the\ntwo correctors can be adjusted one at a time to reduce the emittance growth\nor the island width. Simulating this procedure gives the results shown in\nFig. 18 and Fig. 19. The emittance growth ,the maximun d\u01ebt,max , is reduced\nby almost a factor of 15 by the best setting of the correctors that was found.\nIn this case, setting the correctors to zero the stopband, d\u03bd12 =0, reduces the\nmaximun emittance growth by a factor of 5.\n\nHigher order resonances\nIn the above, results were presented for the 3nux=19 and the \u03bdx + 2\u03bdy = 19\nresonances.
