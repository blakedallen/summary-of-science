As an\ntypical example to support our perspectives on quantum computation,\nwe study quantum computing in one-dimensional nonrelativistic system\nwith delta-function interaction, where the two-body scattering matrix\nsatisfies the factorisation equation (the quantum Yang\u2013Baxter equation)\nand acts as a parametric two-body quantum gate. We conclude by comparing quantum computing via the factorisable scattering with topological quantum computing.\n\nComputers are physical objects, and computations are physical processes.\nThis sentence becomes one of Deutsch's famous quotes, and is a helpful guiding\nprinciple to understand Deutsch's original perspectives on quantum computation\nin his two seminal papers [1, 2]. With it, a large-scale quantum computer is a\nquantum many-body system, and its motion from an initial state to a final state\nis the performance of quantum computation from an input to an output. An\nexplicit example for this statement is the quantum circuit model of computation\n[2], which expresses an output as the result of a sequence of quantum gates on\nan input, in which a quantum gate is a unitary transformation with its input\nand output and implemented by a quantum process with the initial state and the\nfinal state.\nAn arbitrary N -qubit unitary quantum gate has the following factorization\nproperty. It can be expressed exactly as a sequence of products of some twoqubit gates [3], which are generated by the CNOT gate with one-qubit gates [4].\nHence a quantum circuit consists of only two-qubit gates or two-qubit gates with\none-qubit gates. On the other hand, Deutsch [2] denoted an N -qubit quantum\ngate by a 2N \u00d7 2N scattering matrix (S-matrix) since both are unitary matrices\nwith the equal number of inputs and outputs, and intuitively viewed quantum\ncomputation performed by an N -qubit quantum gate as an N -qubit quantum\nelastic scattering process. Therefore, a quantum circuit model can be viewed\nas a factorisable scattering model [5], which is our observation on the physics\nunderlying the quantum circuit model.\n1\n\nzhangyo2008@gmail.com\n\n1\n\n\fSuppose that we already have a quantum computer able to perform universal\nquantum computation or a specified class of computation tasks. To set up and\noperate on such a machine, it is the best to solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation of\nthis many-body system to derive its exact wavefunction and then have its all key\nphysical properties. That is, a quantum computer is associated with an exactly\nsolvable quantum many-body system, also because many known exactly solvable\nmodels are integrable models [5] naturally giving rise to factorisable scattering\nmodels.\nAlmost all known integrable models are solved by the Bethe ansatz [5]. The\nansatz is an assumption on the wavefunction of a quantum many-body system\nand is able to transform the problem of solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation into the\nproblem of solving algebraic equations. It was originally proposed by Bethe in\nthe study of the Heisenberg spin chain, and later was used by many authors to\nsolve one-dimensional model with \u03b4-function interaction, one-dimensional Hubbard model, etc. Our proposal can be hence stated as follows, a quantum circuit\nmodel is associated with a quantum many-body system solved by the Bethe ansatz.\nThat is, we choose to explore physics of quantum computer with the Bethe ansatz.\nIn Sutherland's book [5], the asymptotic Bethe ansatz has the same content as\nthe factorisable scattering, and so equivalently, we focus on quantum computing\nvia the factorisable scattering.\nMany-body quantum scattering in two dimensional space-time is called factorisable scattering [6] if and only if it has the properties: all collisions are purely\nelastic processes; only two-body collisions are allowed; the order of two-body\ncollisions can be adjusted under the consistency condition. Hence the N -body\nfactorisable collision is expressed as a sequence of two-body collisions, i.e., the N body factorisable scattering matrix (S-matrix) is equal to a product of N (N \u22121)/2\ntwo-body S-matrices. The two-body S-matrix satisfies the consistence condition\ncalled the factorization equation, which was firstly discovered by McGuire [6] and\nis now often referred to as the quantum Yang\u2013Baxter equation [7].\nNontrivial unitary solutions of the factorization equation, i.e., two-body scattering matrices, have been recognized by the author and his coauthors [8, 9, 10]\nas parametric two-body quantum gates from the viewpoint of mathematicians\nor mathematical physicists. The author named integrable quantum computing to\nstand for quantum computing via non-trivial unitary solutions of the factorisation\nequation in his previous paper [11], which can be generalized to represent quantum computing via the Bethe ansatz, i.e., the title of this paper. As an example,\nlet us focus on integrable quantum computing in one-dimensional nonrelativistic\nsystem with \u03b4-function interaction, and interested readers are invited to refer\nto Bose and Korepin's latest preprint [12] as a preliminary introduction on how\nto have the two-body scattering matrix as a quantum gate between two flying\nparticles.\n\n2\n\n\fTake Yang's notation [7] for the two-body scattering matrix,\n12\nY12\n=\n\ni(p1 \u2212 p2 )P12 + c\ni(p1 \u2212 p2 ) \u2212 c\n\nwhere c denotes interaction strength and c > 0 (c < 0) means repulsive (attraction) interaction, p1 and p2 represent momenta of two flying particles respectively,\nand P12 denotes the permutation operator (the Swap gate) acting on internal\nstates of these two flying particles 2 . Note that the two-body scattering matrix\nin the Heisenberg spin chain and the Hubbard model [5] has a similar form of\n12 , and so our research can be applied to these models in principle.\nY12\nDefine a new variable \u03c6 in the way,\ntan \u03c6 =\n\np2 \u2212 p1\n,\nc\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n<\u03c6< ,\n2\n2\n\n12 by\nand it gives rise to a new form of the scattering matrix Y12\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n1\n0\n0\n0\n2i\u03c6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n1\u2212e2i\u03c6\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0 1+e2\n12\n2\nY12\n(\u03c6) = \u2212e\u22122i\u03c6 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7,\n2i\u03c6\n2i\u03c6\n1+e\n\uf8ed 0 1\u2212e2\n0 \uf8f8\n2\n0\n0\n0\n1\n\nwhich can be implemented as a parametric two-body gate modulo a phase factor\nin the scattering process between a flying qubit and a static qubit [13]. As the\nparameter \u03c6 has the value \u00b1 \u03c04 , i.e., p2 \u2212 p1 = \u00b1c, we have a maximal entangling\ngate to yield the Bell states with local unitary transformations.\n12 has the form\nIntroduce another symbol \u03b1 = i tan \u03c6, the scattering matrix Y12\n12\nY12\n=\u2212\n\n1\n(1 \u2212 \u03b1P12 )\n1+\u03b1\n\nwhich is a rational solution of the factorisation equation and has been associated\nwith the Werner state, see the author and his coauthors' paper [9] for the detail.\n12 can be explored\nTherefore, the entangling properties of the scattering matrix Y12\nwith the help of the entangling properties of the Werner state. In addition, the\n12\nWerner state is invariant under SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2), and so the scattering matrix Y12\n12\ndoes. This too much symmetry decides the scattering matrix Y12 not to be a\nuniversal quantum gate [3] generating all unitary transformations.\n12 has an exponential form of P ,\nIn terms of \u03c6, the scattering matrix Y12\n12\n12\nY12\n(\u03c6) = ei(\u03c0\u2212\u03c6) e\u2212i\u03c6P12 ,\n2\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n<\u03c6<\n2\n2\n\nThe permutation operator P12 is noted for identical bosonic particles or distinguishable\nparticles, while \u2212P12 is used for identical fermionic particles. Bose and Korepin's notation\non the two-body scattering matrix [12] is obtained from ours by multiplying the permutation\noperator P12 and exchanging the positions of p1 and p2 .\n\n3\n\n\fwhich suggests that it is impossible to have an exact Swap gate P12 directly by\ntaking \u03c6 = \u03c02 but possible to approximate the Swap gate by taking p2 \u2212 p1 \u226b c,\ni.e., \u03c6 = \u03c02 + \u01eb with infinitesimal parameter \u01eb in the way\n12\nY12\n(\n\n\u03c0\n+ \u01eb) = P12 + O(\u01eb).\n2\n\nFortunately, there exists the\n\u221a other way to have an exact Swap gate modulo a\nphase factor by use of the Swap gate. As p2 \u2212 p1 = c, the scattering matrix\n12 has the form\nY12\np\n12 \u03c0\nY12\n( ) = i Swap,\n4\n\u221a\nwith the Swap gate given by\np\n\nSwap = P+ + iP\u2212 ,\n\nP+ =\n\n1 + P12\n,\n2\n\nP\u2212 =\n\n1 \u2212 P12\n,\n2\n\nwhich implements the Swap gate modulo a phase factor in the way\n12 \u03c0\n12 \u03c0\nP12 = \u2212Y12\n( ) * Y12\n( ).\n4\n4\n\u221a\nAs Loss and DiVincenzo [14] pointed out: two Swap gates with three onequbit gates yield the CNOT gate, and hence we can perform universal quantum\n12 ( \u03c0 ) with local unitary transformations\ncomputation via the scattering matrix Y12\n4\non flying qubits.\n~1 * S\n~2 between two spin-1/2 particles,\nIn terms of the Heisenberg interaction S\nthe Swap operator P12 has a form\n\n~1 * S\n~2 + 1 ,\nP12 = 2S\n2\n12 (\u03c6) can be expressed as a time evolution\nand the two-body scattering matrix Y12\nU12 (\u03c6) of the Heisenberg interaction modulo a phase factor,\n3\n\n12\nY12\n(\u03c6) = \u2212e\u2212i 2 \u03c6 U12 (2\u03c6),\n\n~ ~\n\nU12 (\u03c6) = e\u2212i\u03c6S1 *S2\n\n12 and U\nwhich means that Y12\n12 are two equivalent parametric two-body quantum\ngates in the quantum circuit model. Obviously U12 is not a universal two-qubit\ngate [3], but DiVincenzo et al., [15] can set up universal quantum computation\nonly using the exchange interaction U12 if a qubit is encoded as a two-dimensional\nsubspace of eight-dimensional Hilbert space of three spin-1/2 particles. Similarly,\nwe encode the entire quantum circuit model as a part of the factorisable scattering\nmodel and are also able to perform universal quantum computation by only using\n12 .\nthe two-body scattering matrix Y12\nLet us conclude by making remarks on the comparison between integrable\nquantum computing [8, 9, 10, 11] and topological quantum computing [16]. Firstly,\nthe factorisation equation leads to the braid group relation with spectral parameter [8], and so nontrivial unitary solutions of the factorisation equation may not\n\n4\n\n\fform a unitary braid representation but is able to form a unitary braid representation at special value of spectral parameter. Since its two-qubit quantum gates\ncan be chosen as a braiding gate or not, integrable quantum computing is viewed\nas topological-like quantum computing, which is a sort of hybrid quantum computing between ordinary quantum computing and topological quantum computing.\nSecondly, Kitaev's toric codes [16] form degenerate groundstates of Hamiltonian\nof the stabilizer formalism of quantum error correction codes, whereas quantum\nerror correction codes, for example, the Shor nine-qubit codes, can be determined\nby the unitary evolution of a Hamiltonian associated with the factorisation equation [11]. Thirdly, topological quantum computing is fault-tolerant due to nontrivial topological aspects such as nontrivial boundary conditions, whereas the\nfault-tolerance of integrable quantum computing is promised by the integrability (for example, scattering without diffractions [5]) of the associated quantum\nmany-body system.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe author wishes to thank Professor Lu Yu and Institute of Physics, Chinese\nAcademy of Sciences, for their hospitality and support during the visit in which\npart of this work was done.\n\nReferences\n[1] D.
