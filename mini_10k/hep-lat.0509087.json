Profile of the ground state density\n2.1 Caloron backgrounds\nAs a testing ground for the Laplacian modes we first investigate a caloron of maximally nontrivial holonomy with its monopole constituents [5, 6] put on a 163 * 4 lattice1 . Fig. 1 (left) shows\nthe action density along the line connecting these monopoles, which are clearly visible as two selfdual (and almost perfectly static) lumps. As another signal the Polyakov loop goes through 12 and\n\u221212 \u2013 which amounts to a local symmetry restoration \u2013 at the monopole cores.\n0.01\n1\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\nFigure 1: A caloron with its constituent monopoles.

We\nwill use these modes as an analyzing tool, like it has been done with fermionic (near) zero modes.\nThe latter owe their existence to the index theorem, and in smooth cases they are localised to\nthe nontrivial background. Laplacian modes are computationally cheaper because they are spacetime scalars and do not suffer from chirality problems nor doubler problems. They seem not to\nbe directly related to topology, but it has been observed that they are sensitive to the location of\ninstantons [1, 2]. The scaling properties of their localization have been investigated recently [3].\nHere we will present two ideas concerning Laplacian modes [4]. The first one is to study what\ncan be learnt from the profile of the modulus of the lowest mode (the 'ground state probability\ndensity') |\u03c60 (x)|2 , in particular with changing boundary conditions. The second idea is to introduce\na novel low-pass filter. It concerns the reconstruction of the gauge background from a few Laplacian\nmodes. The purpose of both methods is to identify the underlying infrared degrees of freedom in\nthe gauge field that are responsible for features like confinement.\n\n\fLaplacian modes for calorons and as a filter\n\nFalk Bruckmann\n\nThe ground state of the Laplacian in this background is shown in Fig. 1 (right). One can see\nthat the presence of monopoles is reflected by a maximum resp. a minimum in the profile of the\nlowest mode (although shifted by up to 2 lattice spacings). In addition to the mode periodic in\nEuclidean time we have depicted the antiperiodic one. In this mode the role of the monopoles are\ninterchanged, which can be understood from a symmetry of the caloron. Hence the lowest-lying\nLaplacian mode 'hops' as the result of changing the boundary conditions. It behaves similar to\nthe caloron fermion zero mode [7] in the context of which complex boundary conditions were\nintroduced first.\n2.2 Thermalized backgrounds\n\n12\nx1\n\n4\n12\n\n12\nx1\n\n4\n\n4\n\n12\n\nx3\n\n12\n\n12\n\n12\nx1\n\n4\n\n4\n\n12\n\nx3\n\n12\n\n4\n\n12\n\n12\n\n4\n\nx3\n\n12\nx1\n\nx1\n\n4\n\nx3\n\n4\n\n4\n\nx3\n\n12\nx1\n\nx1\n\n4\n\nx3\n\n4\n\nx3\n\n12\n4\n\n12\nx1\n\n4\n\n4\n\n12\n\n12\nx1\n\n4\n\n4\n\nx3\n\n12\n\n4\n\nx3\n\nFigure 2: The lowest Laplacian mode in a thermalized background with \u03b6 = 0.02, 0.355, 0.48 from left to\nright and in lattice planes (x2 , x4 ) = (12, 1), (4, 4), (6, 3) from top to bottom. The vertical scale is 0.05.\n2 The\n\nglobal minimum is not stable enough to employ it for analyzing purposes.\n\n305 / 3\n\nPoS(LAT2005)305\n\nIn this subsection we explore the Laplacian modes as an analyzing tool on thermalized gauge\nfield configurations. Fig. 2 shows the lowest-lying mode in a generic background obtained on a\n163 * 4 lattice at \u03b2 = 2.2 (which amounts to T = 0.75 Tc ) confirming the expectation that these\nmodes are free of UV fluctuations. We allow for a complex phase in the boundary condition,\n\u03c6 (x4 + N4 ) = exp(2\u03c0 i\u03b6 )\u03c6 (x4 ) parametrised by an angle \u03b6 \u2208 [0, 1/2] (the remaining \u03b6 's can be\nmapped to this interval by charge conjugation). The 'evolution' of the Laplacian mode with this\nangle is shown vertically in Fig. 2, while the 3 rows represent different but fixed lattice planes,\nwhich contain the global maximum of the mode. In the example we find 3 lattice locations which\nbecome the global maximum within some \u03b6 -interval. Therefore, the lowest Laplacian mode in a\nthermalized background is hopping, too.\nAt the hopping points in \u03b6 the value of the maximum2 as well as the inverse participation ratio\n\n\fLaplacian modes for calorons and as a filter\n\nFalk Bruckmann\n\n3. A Fourier-like filter\nLaplacian ('harmonic') eigenmodes can be used to define a new Fourier-like filter which we\npresent now [4]. We were inspired by the representation of the field strength in terms of fermionic\nmodes in [11], but here we aim to reconstruct directly the link variables on which any observable\ncan be measured. To this end we combine the definition of the lattice Laplacian, Eq. (1.1), with a\nspectral decomposition and at y = x + \u03bc\u0302 immediately obtain\nN\n\nU\u03bcab (x) = \u2212 \u2211 \u03bbn \u03c6na (x)\u03c6n\u2217b (x + \u03bc\u0302 ) ,\n\nN = N1 N2 N3 N4 * 2\n\n(3.1)\n\nn=1\n\nThe idea is to truncate the sum on the right hand side of this equation at some N \u226a N . The question\narises, how to relate such an expression to a unitary link variable. Here the charge conjugation\nhelps, since it guarantees that every eigenvalue is two-fold degenerate with eigenfunction related\nas \u03c6 \u2032a (x) = \u03b5 ab \u03c6 \u2217b (x). It follows that the corresponding bilinear expressions in Eq. (3.1) add up to\nan element of SU (2) up to a factor. The same applies to the staple average in cooling or smearing.\nWe divide by the square root of this factor, which is the determinant and positive for all practical\npurposes, and obtain the final filter formula\n!\ni p\nh\nN\n/ det(. . .)\n\u0168\u03bcab (x)N = \u2212 \u2211 \u03bbn \u03c6na (x)\u03c6n\u2217b (x + \u03bc\u0302 ) \u2212 \u03b5 ac\u03c6nc (x)\u03c6n\u2217d (x + \u03bc\u0302 )\u03b5 db\n(3.2)\nn=1\n\nThe quality of the filter is controlled by N, where N = N reproduces the original configuration\nexactly. In the other extreme case, N = 1, the filtered links \u0168\u03bc (x) can be shown to be pure gauge.\nFrom the behaviour of \u03c6 a (x) under gauge transformations it follows immediately that \u0168\u03bc (x) transforms as a link (and no gauge fixing is involved in the filter).\nThe filtering can be performed with Laplacian modes of any boundary condition. Then Eq.\n(3.2) is just the average over opposite boundary conditions \u03b6 and \u2212\u03b6 . This additional parameter\n305 / 4\n\nPoS(LAT2005)305\n\n(taking values between IPR = 4 and IPR = 11) decrease and the mode rearranges itself. For some\nboundary conditions the lowest Laplacian mode can be characterized as a global structure.\nAnalyzing 50 independent configurations the lowest mode hops up to four times as a function\nof \u03b6 . Apart from the Laplacian mode being wave-like, the hopping phenomenon resembles the\nbehaviour of the fermion zero mode [8]. However, in both cases it is not obvious which gluonic\nfeature, say in the topological charge, discriminates the preferred locations. Interestingly, we have\nfound a correlation of the maximum of the periodic and antiperiodic Laplacian mode to positive\nand negative Polyakov loops, respectively. This is the same tendency as for calorons (see Fig. 1)\nwhich could be understood as an argument for calorons 'underlying' the quantum configuration.\nAlternatively, the Polyakov loop could play a role defining pinning centers for the Laplacian mode\nin the spirit of Anderson localisation in a random potential [9].\nThe lowest Laplacian mode in the adjoint representation we have found to have minima at\nthe caloron monopoles (see also [1, 10]) that extend to two-dimensional sheets for antiperiodic\nboundary conditions. In thermalized backgrounds, the maxima of the adjoint modes are correlated\nto the fundamental ones with the same boundary condition, but are stronger localized than the latter.\n\n\fLaplacian modes for calorons and as a filter\n\nFalk Bruckmann\n\n1\n\n1\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n4\n\n16\n\n-1\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n-1\n\nFigure 3: Action and topological density and Polyakov loop of the caloron of Fig. 1 (left) filtered with N = 4\n(left, densities multiplied by 100) and N = 150 (right, densities multiplied by 400) modes (\u03b6 = 1/4).\n\noriginal\nN=2\nN=4\nN=10\nN=100\n\n0.0001\n\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nFigure 4: Polyakov loop correlator plotted on an inverse logarithmic scale over the distance for different N\n(at \u03b6 = 1/4) compared to the original one.\n\n305 / 5\n\nPoS(LAT2005)305\n\ncompletely fixes the Polyakov loop at N = 1 to tr P\u0303(~x)/2 = cos(2\u03c0\u03b6 ), while for nontrivial cases\nN \u2265 2 the Polyakov loop is observed to fluctuate around this value. It follows that in order to\noptimize the filter for our circumstances (confined phase, nontrivial holonomy calorons) the best\nchoice is \u03b6 = 1/4, i.e. halfway between periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions.\nIn order to test the filter we again start with the caloron background. Fig. 3 shows the action\nand topological density as well as the Polyakov loop measured on the filtered links \u0168\u03bc (x), to be\ncompared with Fig. 1 (left). The filter with the number of modes as low as N = 4 starts to reproduce\nthe classical structures qualitatively, while for N = 150 the agreement is almost perfect.\nWhat is even more remarkable is that the filter method preserves the string tension. We plot\nthe logarithm of the Polyakov loop correlator measured on 50 configurations at T = 0.75 Tc in Fig.\n4. It reveals a clearly linear behaviour with a slope reproducing the original one within 15%. The\nminimal number of modes, N = 2, suffices for this behaviour. We conclude that the confining\nproperties of lattice gauge theory are captured by the lowest Laplacian modes.

At zero distance the values h(tr P\u0303(~x))2 i are smaller than the original one which\nindicates that the distribution of Polyakov loops over the lattice sites has become narrower.\nSince the filter is not biased to classical solutions nor to particular degrees of freedom in\nthe gauge field (like monopoles or vortices), it is interesting to have a closer look at the vacuum\nstructures that emerge when the filter is applied to generic configurations. In both the Polyakov loop\nand the action density, more and more fluctuations appear with an increasing number of modes kept\nin the filter. It might well be that the fluctuation at N = 2 are the minimally required ones for the\nlong-range physics.\nConcerning the action density, these objects are isolated peaks (which are non-static and not\nnecessarily (anti)selfdual). This phenomenon is counterintuitive as the filter uses the lowest-lying\nLaplacian modes, however, this is also the case for the classical calorons, see Fig. 3 (left). We have\nfound a correlation of the peak structure of the filtered action density to that emerging after cooling\nor smearing in an early stage. More work has to be done to better understand the (N-dependent)\nspiky structures induced by the filter.\n\n\f"}
