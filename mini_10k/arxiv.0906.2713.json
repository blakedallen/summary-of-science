The line of nodes of the tilted disc precesses\nslowly in the retrograde direction, resulting in a photometric signal with a period\nslightly less than the orbital period. We use the method of smoothed particle hydrodynamics to simulate a series of models of differing mass ratio and effective viscosity\nto determine the retrograde precession period and superhump period deficit \u03b5\u2212 as a\nfunction of system mass ratio q. We tabulate our results and present fits to both \u03b5\u2212\nand \u03b5+ versus q, as well as compare the numerical results with those compiled from\nthe literature of negative superhump observations. One surprising is that while we find\nnegative superhumps most clearly in simulations with an accretion stream present, we\nalso find evidence for negative superhumps in simulations in which we shut off the\nmass transfer stream completely, indicating that the origin of the photometric signal\nis more complicated than previously believed.\nKey words: accretion, accretion discs - binaries: general, close - novae, cataclysmic\nvariables.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nCataclysmic variable (CV) binaries typically contain a white\ndwarf primary M1 accreting matter from a low-mass mainsequence secondary M2 via an accretion disc (Warner 1995a;\nHellier 2001). The Roche-lobe filling secondary star loses\nmass through the L1 inner Lagrange point at a rate in the\napproximate range \u1e40 \u223c 10\u221211 to \u223c10\u22127 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . The\nobserved system characteristics depend most strongly on the\nmass ratio and individual masses, inclination, mass-transfer\nrate and composition, and the strength and geometry of any\nmagnetic fields that may be present.\nSystems with accretion flows that are not substantially affected by stellar magnetic fields and with mass\n<\nratios q = M2 /M1 in the range 0.03 <\n\u223c q \u223c 0.35 (e.g.,\nBaker-Branstetter & Wood 1999; Montgomery 2001; this\nwork) can have the outer disc extend to radii approximately\nbetween that of the 3:1 corotation radius and the 2:1 corotation resonance allowing driving by the mode-coupling mechanism first identified by Lubow (1991). Within this range,\ncommon superhump oscillations can be driven and yield\nphotometric time-series with amplitudes of up to \u223c0.1 magnitudes and periods slightly in excess of the orbital period.\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: wood@fit.edu\n\nThe observed fractional period excess of the superhump oscillations increases with increasing mass\nratio (Patterson et al. 2005). The hydrodynamics of\nthe superhump oscillations have been simulated numerically and extensively with particle-based schemes\nincluding smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH;\nWhitehurst 1988; Hirose & Osaki 1990; Whitehurst & King\n1991;\nWhitehurst\n1994;\nMurray\n1996,\n1998;\nSimpson & Wood 1998; Wood, Montgomery, & Simpson\n2000; Foulkes, Haswell, & Murray 2006; Smith et al.\n2007) and recently with a 2D grid-based approach\n(Kley, Papaloizou, & Ogilvie 2008). First recognized as\nphotometric variations with a period a few percent longer\nthan the orbital period that occurred during the superoutbursts of the SU UMa subclass of dwarf novae (Vogt\n1974; Warner 1975), common superhump oscillations have\nsince been identified in novalike CVs (Patterson et al.\n1993b; Retter, Leibowitz, & Ofek 1997; Skillman et al.\n1997), the double helium white dwarf AM CVn binaries (Patterson, Halpern, & Shambrook 1993a; Warner\n1995b; Nelemans 2005), and in low-mass X-ray binaries\n(Charles et al. 1991; Mineshige, Hirose, & Osaki 1992;\nO'Donoghue & Charles 1996; Hynes et al. 2006).\nCommon superhumps are interchangeably referred to\nas positive or apsidal superhumps in the literature, or\n\n\f2\n\nM. A. Wood et al.\n\njust superhumps with no modifier. The term \"positive\" is\nempirically-based and refers simply to the sign of the positive period excess \u03b5+ defined as \u03b5+ = (P+ \u2212Porb )/Porb where\nwe adopt the notation P+ to represent the positive superhump oscillation period. The term apsidal is dynamicallybased and refers to simulation results indicating that while\nthe radial disc profile as a function of co-rotating azimuthal\nangle is non-stationary, the oscillation-averaged profile is eccentric with a line of apsides that precesses slowly in the\n+\norbital prograde direction with a period Pprec\ngiven by\n1\n+\nPprec\n\n=\n\n1\nPorb\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n.\nP+\n\n(1)\n\nAn accretion disc which is tilted out of the orbital plane will precess in the retrograde direction,\nanalogous to the retrograde precession of the line of\nnodes of the moon's orbit. We first studied this numerically in Wood, Montgomery, & Simpson (2000, hereafter Paper I, and see also Montgomery 2004). In an\nearly paper discussing the eclipsing binary TV Col,\nBonnet-Bidaud, Motch, & Mouchet (1985) suggested that\nthe observed 5.2-h period was the difference between the\norbital frequency \u03bdorb = 1/Porb (where Porb = 5.5\n\u2212\nh) and the natural retrograde precession frequency \u03bdprec\n\u2212\n(Pprec\n\u2248 4 d) of a tilted disc. In a follow-up study,\nBarrett, O'Donoghue, & Warner (1988) suggested that the\nphysical source of the observed periodicity was the sweeping\nof the accretion stream bright spot across the face of a tilted\ndisc, a model we were able to confirm in Wood & Burke\n(2007, hereafter Paper II) and which was also discussed in\nFoulkes, Haswell, & Murray (2006). These photometric variations \u2013 with periods slightly less than Porb and a completely\ndifferent physical origin than the common superhumps \u2013\nhave also have come to be classified as superhumps. While\nthe name nodal superhumps has been proposed as a physically descriptive name for these variations (and is the one\nwe prefer), it is most common in the literature to refer to\nthem as negative superhumps, from the sign of the relation\n\u03b5\u2212 = (P\u2212 \u2212 Porb )/Porb , where P\u2212 is the observed photometric period of this phenomenon. In this work we refer to\nthe fractional period offset of the common superhumps as\nthe period excess \u03b5+ , and the fractional period offset of the\nnodal/negative superhumps as the period deficit \u03b5\u2212 .\nIn Paper II we presented visualizations and ray-traced\nsimulation light curves which confirmed that the dominant\nphysical source of the negative superhump signal is the\nchanging depth of the accretion stream bright spot in the\npotential well of the white dwarf primary. The bright spot\nof an untilted disc will always be located on the outer edge\nof the disc, but if the disc is tilted the bright spot can impact the face of the disc. Consider that for a disc which is\ntilted and fixed in the inertial frame, the bright spot will\nimpact the edge of the disc exactly twice per orbit, and between these times will sweep across first one face of the disc\nand then the other. Assuming there are no dynamicallysignificant magnetic fields, the accretion stream will flow in\nthe orbital plane of the binary, and impact the disc face or\ndisc rim roughly along the line of nodes. Negative superhump maximum occurs when the bright spot is at minimum\nradius \u2013 having fallen further in the primary star's potential well, there is more specific kinetic energy to dissipate,\nand the bright spot is more luminous. The ray-traced light\n\ncurves in Paper II show that negative superhumps observed\nfrom opposite sides of the disc will differ in phase by 180\u25e6 .\nFor a tilted disc that precesses slowly in the retrograde di\u2212\nrection with a period Pprec\n, the negative superhump signal\nhas a period slightly less than the orbital period,\n1\n1\n1\n=\n+ \u2212 .\nP\u2212\nPorb\nPprec\n\n2\n\n(2)\n\nNUMERICS AND PARAMETERS\n\nWe simulate accretion disc dynamics using our\nsmoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code1 (Simpson\n1995; Simpson & Wood 1998; Wood & Burke 2007;\nDolence, Wood, & Silver 2008). The work presented here\nwas calculated in parallel with a large parametric study of\ncommon superhumps to be published separately.\nSPH is a Lagrangian fluid dynamics technique originally developed by Lucy (1977) and Gingold & Monaghan\n(1977) that has seen wide use in astrophysical\napplications (Benz 1990; Monaghan 1992, 2005;\nWhitehouse, Bate, & Monaghan 2005; Wetzstein et al.\n2008). The fluid properties are calculated by using a kernel\ninterpolation in the scattered grid defined by the particles\nthemselves. As is typical, we use a normalized spline\nkernel (Monaghan & Lattanzio 1985) that approximates\na Gaussian but is identically zero beyond an interparticle\ndistance of 2h, where h is the smoothing length.\nIn their general forms, the momentum and energy equations including gravitational body forces are\n(Simpson & Wood 1998; Wood & Burke 2007):\nd2 r\ndt2\n\n=\n\n\u2212\n\nGM2\n\u2207P\nGM1\nr1 \u2212\nr2 ,\n+ fvisc \u2212\n\u03c1\nr1 3\nr2 3\n\n(3)\n\ndu\ndt\n\n=\n\n\u2212\n\nP\n\u2207 * v + \u01ebvisc ,\n\u03c1\n\n(4)\n\nwhere fvisc is the viscous force, \u01ebvisc is the energy generation\nfrom viscous dissipation, r1,2 \u2261 r \u2212 rM 1,M 2 are the displacements from the stellar masses M1 and M2 , respectively, and\nthe remaining symbols are defined as usual.\nThe form of the SPH momentum equation for a particle\ni is given by\nd2 ri\ndt2\n\n=\n\n\u2212\n\nX\nj\n\n\u2212\n\nmj\n\n\u0012\n\nPi\nPj\n+ 2\n\u03c1i 2\n\u03c1j\n\n\u0013\n\n(1 + \u03a0ij ) \u2207i Wij\n\nGM2\nGM1\nri1 \u2212\nri2 ,\nri1 3\nri2 3\n\n(5)\n\nwhere mj is the mass of particle j and W is the SPH kernel\nfunction. We use the artificial viscosity approximation of\nLattanzio et al. (1986) evaluated between particles i and j,\n\u03a0ij =\n\n(\n\n\u2212\u03b1\u03bcij + \u03b2\u03bc2ij\n\nvij * rij \u2264 0;\n\n0\n\notherwise;\n\n(6)\n\nwhere\n1\n\nA user-friendly version of this incorporating a graphical user interface and double-buffered graphics is available for free download (www.astro.fit.edu/wood/fitdisk.html;\nWood, Dolence, & Simpson 2006).\n\n\fA Parametric Study of Negative Superhumps\n\u03bcij =\n\nhvij * rij\n2\ncs,ij (rij\n+ \u03b72 )\n\n(7)\n\nwhere vij = vi \u2212 vj , rij = ri \u2212 rj . The the average of the\nsound speeds for particles i and j is cs,ij . For the simulations\nwe present here, we adopt the parameters \u03b1 = 1.5, \u03b2 = 0.0\nor 0.5, \u03b7 = 0.1h. As is typical in artificial viscosity prescriptions, only approaching particles feel a viscous force. We use\na gamma-law ideal gas equation of state P = (\u03b3 \u2212 1)\u03c1u and\nuse \u03b3 = 1.01 since we do not includep\nradiative losses. Within\nthis model the sound speed is cs = \u03b3(\u03b3 \u2212 1)u.\nIn our simulations, all particles have the same smoothing length within a given simulation, varying smoothly from\nh = 0.0040a for the q = 0.75 run to h = 0.0067a for the\nq = 0.01 run, where a is the semimajor axis of the binary\nand a = 1 in system units. The SPH particles can have\ntheir own individual time steps as short as needed to resolve the local dynamics. The largest timestep a particle can\nhave is \u03b4t0 = Porb /200, and other available timesteps are\n\u03b4tk = \u03b4t0 /2k , where 1 < k < kmax and typically kmax = 9.\nAs discussed in Simpson & Wood (1998), we integrate\nthe internal energies using an action-reaction principle which\nis formally equivalent to the standard SPH energy equation.\nWe assume that the sum of the changes in the internal energies of all the particles over the previous time step (\u03b4t0 )\nis directly proportional to the change in the bolometric luminosity of the disc over that same time interval, but do\nnot include radiative transfer explicitly. With this assumption we can estimate a \"simulation light curve\" as the time\nseries over timesteps n,\nLn =\n\nX \u0010 du \u0011n\nj\n\ndt\n\n\u03b4t0 ,\n\n(8)\n\nj\n\nand it is the frequencies present in these light curves that\nwe discuss below. The dominant source of increase for the\nparticles' internal energies is viscous dissipation, but we also\ninclude positive and negative P dV work in the summation.\nWe begin our discs ab initio, injecting at a rate of typically Rinj = 2000 or 3000 particles per orbit until we reach\nour desired total of 100,000 particles in the disc. Our code\nhas two options for handling particle accretion and injection. The first option, and the one we use most often, is to\npromptly reinject at L1 any particles that are ejected from\nthe system or accreted onto M1 or M2 . The second option\ndecouples the injection rate from the accretion rate; injection through L1 is at a constant rate, and accreted or lost\nparticles are not promptly replaced at the L1 region. In the\nsimulations we present in this work, we promptly re-inject\nduring the initial evolution, so the total particle number\nsimply increases linearly in time until the maximum number of particles have been injected, and from that point on\nthe particle number is is held constant.\nN=\n\n(\n\nRt\n\nt < Nmax /R\n\nNmax\n\notherwise.\n\n(9)\n\nBecause the discs are initially forced to have a constant total\nnumber particles as a result of the prompt particle reinjection after accretion or loss, the discs settle into a dynamical\nequilibrium. Discs that are not unstable to positive superhump oscillations reach stationary states in the co-rotating\nframe. Those that are driven to superhump oscillations settle\ninto a state of dynamical equilibrium where the dissipation\n\n3\n\nlight curve pulse shape is stationary from one superhump\ncycle to the next.\nTo scale our models to physical units, we use the empirical mass-radius relation of Patterson et al. (2005). The authors note that the data are \"too sparse to yield trustworthy\nresults\" for secondaries with masses below 0.06M\u2299 . However, needing an analytical relation in this regime whether\ntrustworthy or not, we use a by-eye linear fit to the few data\npoints shown in their Fig. 12 to obtain the modified massradius relation that we use to obtain the periods given in\nTable 1 below:\n\nR2 =\n\n\uf8f1\n0.23(M2 /M\u2299 )0.27 M2 < 0.06 M\u2299\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n0.62(M2 /M\u2299 )0.61\n\n0.06 < M2 /M\u2299 < 0.20\n\n0.92(M2 /M\u2299 )0.71\n\nM2 > 0.20M\u2299 .\n\n(10)\n\nOnce the disc in a given simulation reaches a state of\n(dynamical) equilibrium, we impose a disc tilt of 5\u25e6 on the\nparticle positions and velocities and restart the simulation,\nevolving parallel sequences both with prompt replacement\nand with the mass injection rate set to zero.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nRESULTS\nPre-tilt Evolution\n\nWe simulated systems with mass ratios from q = 0.01 to\nq = 0.75. Simulations throughout this range yield negative\nsuperhumps in the light curves if the disc is tilted out of the\nplane and the simulation continues using prompt replacement of accreted/lost particles (see, e.g., Papers I & II). In\nFig. 1 we show \"snapshots\" of systems of 4 representative\nmass ratios at selected orbits and scaled to physical dimensions using the modified secondary mass-radius relation of\nPatterson et al. (2005) as given in Eq. (10) above. Our range\n<\nof mass ratios includes systems with 0.03 <\n\u223c q \u223c 0.35 that are\nunstable to positive superhump oscillations. In the Figure\nwe show a disc of q = 0.05 that is near superhump maximum, a disc of q = 0.20 that is near superhump minimum,\nas well as discs of q = 0.40 and 0.75 that are stable. The\ndimensionless disk thickness for these simulations is roughly\nH/r \u2248 0.04 as determined by-eye using a plot of z versus\nr. For comparison, see Fig. 11 of Wood et al. (2005) which\nshows z vs. r for a simulation of q = 0.66 appropriate for\nthat study of DQ Herculis.\nAs an example of a simulation unstable to common superhump oscillations, we show in Fig. 2 the light curve of 200\norbits of a q = 0.05 simulation for which the initial injection\nrate was 2000 particles per orbit. Common superhump oscillations begin at approximately orbit 70, and the disc settles\ninto a state of dynamical equilibrium by roughly orbit 100.\nThe average pulse shape and Fourier transform of orbits 100\nto 200 are shown in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. The third\nharmonic dominates the average pulse shape, and this is reflected in the Fourier transform. We will present the details\nof our apsidal superhump study in a separate publication.\nAs an example of a system that is not unstable to apsidal superhump oscillations, we show in Fig. 5 the first 200\norbits of a simulation with mass ratio q = 0.40. The initial\nparticle injection rate for this simulation was 3000 per orbit,\nso 100,000 particles have been injected by orbit 34. By orbit\n\n\f4\n\nM. A. Wood et al.\n\nFigure 2. The q = 0.05 simulation results from start to orbit\n200, by which time the disc is in a state of dynamical equilibrium\ndefined as having common superhump oscillations that produce a\nlight curve that repeats from one cycle to the next. In the figure\nabove we sum 5 points in the light curve to yield 40 points per\norbit, but no smoothing has been applied. Note that the scale of\nthe lower panel differs from that of the upper panel by a factor\nof 2.\n\nFigure 1. Snapshots of mass ratios q = 0.05 (shown near superhump maximum) The centre of mass is indicated by a plus\n(+) sign. The primary white dwarf is shown to scale (RWD =\n0.011 R\u2299 for 0.8 M\u2299 ), and the Roche lobes are also shown. The\nsnapshots are at orbital phase zero. The x axis points towards the\nbottom of the page, the y axis points to the right, and the z axis\npoints out of the page.\n\n200, the disc has reached a stationary state in the co-rotating\nframe. Because we note some small trend in orbits 100\u2013200,\nwe ran the sequence out to orbit 400 and repeated some of\nthe experiments. We found no difference in the resulting \u03b5\u2212\nor simulation light curves.\nThe cause of the disc tilts in CVs is not completely understood at the time of this writing. While\nin the low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) it is believed\nthat radiation pressure can provide the force necessary to tilt the disc (Petterson 1977; Iping & Petterson\n1990; Pringle 1996, 1997; Foulkes, Haswell, & Murray 2006;\nIvanov & Papaloizou 2008), this mechanism cannot explain\nthe disc tilt in CV discs. Barrett, O'Donoghue, & Warner\n(1988) suggested in their early study of TV Col that magnetic fields on the secondary might be able to deflect the\naccretion flow through the L1 region out of the orbital\nplane, thus breaking that symmetry, but as discussed in Paper II, as long as the deflection angle is stationary in the\nco-rotating frame and the mass transfer rate constant, the\norbit-averaged angular momentum vector of the accretion\nstream is still parallel with the orbital angular momentum\nvector. Thus no tilt could be generated. Murray et al. (2002)\nshowed that a disc tilt could be generated by instantaneously\nturning on a magnetic field on the secondary star of the system. This tilt decayed with time, but suggests that changing\nmagnetic field geometries on the secondary could lead to disc\ntilts. The model which is most generally accepted is that the\n\nFigure 3.

We bin into 50 samples per cycle, and show 2 cycles\nof the oscillation. Note that the third harmonic is a dominant\ncomponent to the pulse shape.\n\nFigure 4. The Fourier amplitude spectrum of orbits 100 to 200 of\nthe q = 0.05 simulation. The peaks in the transform are labeled\nwith their frequencies in units of cycles per orbit. As found in\nsome observed systems, the fundamental (first harmonic) peak is\nnot the highest-amplitude peak in the amplitude spectrum.\n\n\fA Parametric Study of Negative Superhumps\n\n5\n\nFigure 5. The q = 0.40 simulation results from start to orbit\n200, by which time the disc is in a stationary state. We sum 5\npoints in the light curve, for a sampling of 40 per orbit. The scale\nof the lower panel differs from that of the upper panel by a factor\nof 2.\n\nprimary white dwarf has a magnetic field, which can tilt the\ninner disc, and this information propagates outward in radius, leading to a general disc tilt. We have completed some\npreliminary simulations which demonstrate that the nonparallel component (i.e., not parallel to the binary angular\nmomentum vector) of the angular momentum of a tilted\ninner disc can propagate outward in radius and result in\nnegative superhumps.\n3.2\n\nPost-tilt Evolution\n\nWe are working on simulations that explore the origin of\nthe disc tilt in negatively superhumping CVs, but for this\nwork, we simply impose a 5\u25e6 tilt on a disc that has reached\na state of dynamical equilibrium, and follow the evolution\nbeyond that point. In Fig. 6 we show the side-view evolution sampled every 5 orbits for sequences with mass ratios\nof q = 0.05, 0.40, and 0.75. The initial snapshot in each\nsequence shows the disc immediately after the disc tilt has\nbeen applied. Note that while the q = 0.40 and 0.75 models\nare outside the mass ratio range that yields positive superhumps, the q = 0.05 model shown is oscillating with positive\nsuperhumps as well as precessing in the retrograde direction.\nFor use in discussions below, we define the direction\n\"up\" to be in the direction of the orbital angular momentum\nvector (it is the +z direction in our simulations). This also\ndefines the terms \"above the plane\" and \"below the plane.\"\nThe geometry shown for the starting conditions at orbit 200\nin Fig. 6 has the line of centres of the stars perpendicular to\nthe line of nodes, and the disc particles nearest the secondary\nare above the orbital plane. We define this to be negative\nsuperhump phase zero. At negative superhump phase 0.5,\nthe line of centres and line of nodes are again perpendicular,\nbut the particles nearest the secondary are below the plane.\nAt negative superhump phases 0.25 (0.75) the line of centres\nand line of nodes are coincident, and the particles nearest the\nsecondary have negative (positive) z velocities on average.\nFor each simulation run, we typically continue the evolution of the titled disc for an additional 50 orbits for the\ntwo cases of (i) prompt particle replacement and constant\ntotal number of particles in the simulation, or (ii) no particle replacement and a decreasing total number of particles in\nthe simulation. We show sample simulation (\"bolometric\")\n\nFigure 6. The side-view evolution sampled every 3 orbits for\nsimulations with mass ratios of q = 0.05, 0.40, and 0.75, from\nleft to right. The Figure shows both that the nodal precession\nfrequency is an increasing function of mass ratio and that the\ntilt is persistent. Note that the q = 0.05 simulation is oscillating\nwith common superhumps as well as precessing in the retrograde\ndirection. The plot limits in x of each subpanel are \u22120.8 to 0.8\nin system units where a \u2261 1. The aspect ratio is 1:1 in the Figure and only 2000 randomly-selected particles are shown for each\nsnapshot.\n\nlight curves for the post-tilt evolution of these two cases for\nthe q = 0.40 run in Fig. 7. The upper curve of the Figure\nis the prompt-replacement case. The increase in mean luminosity is the result of increased accretion onto the primary\nas a result of the accretion stream depositing new mass directly to annuli of small radius. Because accreted particles\nare promptly replaced, this also enhances the particle injection rate at L1 over the pre-tilt average. The system relaxes\nto a new quasi-equilibrium after about 10 orbits. The lower\ncurve of the Figure shows the case where we have shut off\nthe injection of particles at L1 completely, which we call\nthe \"no-stream\" case. Here the system luminosity decreases\nboth because there is no accretion stream bright spot, and\nbecause the total number of particles in the disc is decreasing monotonically. At orbit 450, only 73,162 of the original\n100,000 particles remain in the disc. The overall disc geometry does not change significantly over p\nthe P\n50 orbits \u2013\n1\ne.g., the root-mean-squared radius rrms =\nri of the\nn\nparticle distribution is rrms = 0.35a for both \u2013 but because\neach particle has fewer nearest neighbors with which it interacts, the total viscous dissipation as a function of time is\ndecreased.\nIn the inset of Fig. 7 we show the fractional amplitudes\nof the first 10 orbits of the post-tilt evolution for the two\ncases. To obtain the fractional amplitudes, we divide the\noriginal (200 samples per orbit) light curve by a copy of the\nlight curve that has been boxcar-smoothed with a window\nwidth of 2 orbits and subtract 1.0. The smoothed curve will\n\n\f6\n\nM. A. Wood et al.\n\nFigure 7. The post-tilt light curves for the q = 0.40 simulation.\nWe show both the light curve for the case of prompt replacement\nof accreted/lost particles (solid circles/upper curve) and for no\nreplacement (open circles/lower curve). Here we have summed 10\ntimesteps for 20 samples per orbit. To bring out the oscillations\nin the light curve, the inset figure shows the first 10 orbits of the\nsame curves as fractional amplitudes as discussed in the text. The\nnegative superhump signal is clearly present in the upper curve\nof the inset, but difficult to discern in the lower curve.\n\ncontain no trace of any strictly periodic signals that have an\ninteger number of cycles per orbit, and will essentially free of\nthe negative and positive superhumps signals. The residual\nfractional amplitude light curve will retain only frequencies\nhigher than \u223c\u03bdorb . Finally we then average groups of 10\npoints to yield the plotted light curve which effectively has\n20 \"exposures\" per orbit.\nIn the upper light curve of the inset of Fig. 7, the negative superhump signal can be clearly seen, while in the lower\ncurve it is not obvious above the noise. Note that the signal\nin the upper curve has a frequency of approximately 2 cycles per orbit. As discussed in Paper II, the reason for this is\nthat the dominant source of the negative superhump signal\nis the transit of the accretion stream bright spot across the\nface of the tilted disc. Because our bolometric light curves\nreflect the viscous dissipation of all the particles in the simulation, there are negative superhump maxima corresponding to the bright spot sweeping across both faces of the disc\nin the prompt-replacement light curve. The minima in this\nlight curve correspond to the times at which the accretion\nstream impacts the disc rim along the line of nodes. In an\nactual system, an observer only sees the effects of the bright\nspot sweeping across a single face of an optically-thick disc,\nand so sees a single maximum and single minimum per orbit.\nFor comparison, we show in Fig. 8 the post-tilt evolution of the q = 0.05 simulation, which has developed positive\nsuperhumps before the tilt is applied at orbit 200. In this\nfigure, we offset the no-stream light curve downward for clarity. Note that the upper curve (with-stream) shows evidence\nfor beating between the negative and positive superhump\nsignals, whereas the lower curve (no-stream) shows only the\npositive superhump signal with no evidence for beating with\na negative superhump signal. Again, the overall luminosity\ndeclines because the total particle number and hence mean\nnumber of nearest neighbors per particle in the simulation\nis decreasing, which decreases the total viscous dissipation.\nWe note, however, that the positive superhump amplitude\nis nearly constant over the 50 orbits even though there is no\naccretion stream and hence no accretion stream bright spot.\n\nFigure 8. The post-tilt light curves for the q = 0.05 simulation.\nWe show both the light curve for the case of prompt replacement\nof accreted/lost particles (solid circles/upper curve) and for no\nreplacement (open circles/lower curve). Here we have summed 10\ntimesteps for 20 samples per orbit. The inset figure shows the first\n10 orbits of the same curves as fractional amplitudes as discussed\nin the text. The negative superhump signal beats with the positive\nsuperhump signal in the upper curve of the inset, but only the\npositive superhump signal is present in the lower curve. Positive\nsuperhumps continue long after the accretion stream is shut off,\nbut comparison with Fig. 3 shows the pulse shape has changed.\n\nThus, the primary contribution to the positive superhump\nsignal is viscous dissipation within the disc itself, and not\nthe varying depth around the orbit of the accretion stream\nbright spot in the potential of the primary white dwarf as is\ncommonly (mis)stated in the literature.\nIn the inset of Fig. 8, we show the first 10 orbits of\nthe two cases as fraction amplitudes, calculated as detailed\nabove. In the upper light curve, there are clearly two signals\npresent as the light curve pulse shape evolves during the\n10 orbits. In the lower curve, only the positive superhump\nsignal is present, and the fractional amplitude appears to\nincrease during these 10 orbits. A comparison with the q =\n0.05 pre-tilt average pulse shape (Fig. 3) does show that the\nharmonic complexity of the light curve has decreased as the\npower in the third harmonic is noticeably reduced.\n\n3.3\n\nAmplitude Spectra and Pulse Shapes\n\nA primary goal of this work is to give analytical expressions\nfor the negative superhump period deficit \u03b5\u2212 as a function\nof mass ratio q and orbital period Porb . To achieve this,\nwe simulated systems with mass ratios spanning the range\n0.01 \u2264 q \u2264 0.75. We evolved the systems to a state of equilibrium, tilted the discs by 5\u25e6 with respect to the orbital plane,\nand continued the simulations either by promptly replacing\nthe accreted/lost particles, which we refer to as the \"with\nstream\" (ws) case, or by shutting off particle injection at L1\ncompletely, which we refer to as the \"no stream\" (ns) case.\nSimulations were continued for typically 50 orbits. For each\nsimulation, we take a Fourier transform of the simulation\nbolometric light curve converted to fractional amplitudes as\ndescribed above, and after removing spurious points that\nare more than 6\u03c3 away from the mean. After calculating\nthe Fourier transform, we interpolate to find the frequencies and amplitudes of the 50 highest peaks. The peaks in\nthe transform have a full width at half-maximum of roughly\n\u03b4\u03bd \u223c 1/50 cyc/orb.\n\n\fA Parametric Study of Negative Superhumps\nIn Fig. 9 we show for representative mass ratios the\nFourier transforms of the post-tilt bolometric light curves\nin both the with-stream and no-stream cases. The negative\nsuperhump signal in the light curves is reflected in the amplitude spectrum as a peak at a frequency slightly greater than\n2 cyc orb\u22121 . This peak can be found in all spectra where the\naccretion stream is present, and in the spectra with mass\nratios of q = 0.30 and above in the no-stream case. The\nq = 0.05 post-tilt spectra show differences from the pre-tilt\nspectra shown in Fig. 4 above, reflecting the differing pulse\nshapes. Note that the post-tilt positive superhump firstharmonic (fundamental) amplitude is significantly higher in\nthe no-stream case as compared with the with-stream case.\nThis result is even more dramatically shown in the q = 0.20\namplitude spectra. The positive superhump amplitudes can\nincrease in the no-stream case because the disc is no longer\naccreting mass of low specific angular momentum at the\ndisc edge, and so can expand slightly and be driven more\nstrongly. Careful comparison with Fig. 4 shows that amplitude of the the first harmonic is also stronger in the withstream case of the post-tilt evolution.\nIn the q = 0.20 with-stream amplitude spectrum, there\nis power at a frequency just above 1.0 cyc orb\u22121 , but this\npower does not indicate a physical oscillation of the disc.\nRather, this is a combination frequency between the first\nharmonic of the positive superhump frequency and the negative superhump signal, resulting from non-sinusoidal pulse\nshapes for the two signals. Inspection of the peak frequencies\nin the figure shows that the frequency difference \u2206 between\nthe simulation negative superhump signal at 2\u03bd\u2212 and the\nsecond harmonic of the positive superhump signal at 2\u03bd+\nyields combination frequencies of n\u03bd+ + \u2206 for several harmonics of the positive superhump fundamental.\nNote that the amplitude spectra of simulations lacking positive superhumps have no significant power near\n\u03bd = 1 cyc orb\u22121 because of the inherent symmetry discussed\nabove. Specifically, the transiting of the bright spot releases\nequal amounts of power on both faces of the disc, and the\nsame must also be true of the tidal effects that give rise\nto the component of the negative superhump signal that\narises even in the absence of an accretion stream. This can\nalso be demonstrated by plotting the average pulse shapes\nfor negative superhumps, which we show in Fig. 10 for a\nmore limited but still representative sample. To compute\nthe average pulse shapes, we compute the fractional amplitude residuals as described above, fold the light curves on\nP\u2212 = 1/\u03bd\u2212 found from the Fourier transform, and bin into\n40 bins per cycle. Because we subtract the time of the first\ndata point from the time series before folding, zero phase\nin these curves is as defined geometrically above (with the\nline of centres perpendicular to line of nodes, and particles\nnearest secondary above the orbital plane). For the mass\nratios shown, it is clear that to within the noise, the simulation bolometric pulse shape repeats twice per negative\nsuperhump cycle. Note finally that Montgomery (2009) in\nher study of negative superhump simulations claims that the\nhalf-cycle average pulse shapes differ (her Figs. 8 and 13).\nHowever, her pulse shapes are undersampled and appear to\ncontain an odd number of bins per cycle. Her Fourier transform shows no significant power near \u03bd = 1, which would\nhave to be present for her claim to be valid.\nThe character of the bolometric average pulse shape\n\n7\n\nFigure 9. Fourier transforms of selected post-tilt simulations. In\nthe figure we show Fourier transforms of 50 orbits of simulations\nwith q = 0.05, 0.20, 0.40, 0.55, and 0.75. After imposing the disc\ntilt, we continued the simulations either with prompt replacement\nof accreted/lost particles (i.e., \"with stream,\" abbreviated \"ws\"),\nor with mass injection shut off completely (i.e., \"no stream\", abbreviated \"ns\"). The Fourier transforms shown are all on the\nsame scale, but the curves have been offset for clarity. See text\nfor discussion.\n\nchanges as a function of mass ratio. In the no-stream case,\nthe amplitude decreases significantly from the q = 0.40 simulation to the q = 0.55 simulation, and is consistent with\nzero to the eye for the q = 0.75 simulation (not shown). In\nthe with-stream case, the q = 0.40 average pulse shape has\ntwo rounded maxima per cycle, whereas the 0.75 average\npulse shape is saw-toothed. The difference may lie in the\nfact that the accretion stream has less specific angular momentum for increasing q, and more specific kinetic energy\nat the bright spot (see again Fig. 1).\nWe present the results of the Fourier analysis in Table 1,\nwhere we give for each run (defined by q and viscosity coefficients \u03b1 and \u03b2) the pre-tilt positive superhump frequency \u03bd+\n(in units of cycles per orbit) and the orbits for which that\nwas calculated, and the post-tilt orbit range and negative\nand positive superhump frequencies and fractional amplitudes for both the with-stream and no-stream cases. Entries\nmarked with a dash (\u2013) indicate no significant periodic signal was found. We note that the tabulated values for the\n\n\f8\n\nM. A. Wood et al.\n\nFigure 10. Average pulse shapes for mass ratios q = 0.40, 0.55,\nand 0.75, computed from the bolometric simulation light curves\nand for both the with-stream and no-stream cases (the q = 0.75\nno-stream average light curve has negligible amplitude and is not\nshown). The curves show that the half-cycle pulse shapes are identical within the noise. The character of the pulse shapes changes\nas a function of mass ratio, becoming more triangular for higher\nmass ratios for the with-stream case.\n\nnegative superhump frequencies are half that found in the\nFourier transforms of the bolometric light curves. The fractional amplitudes are those of the peaks 2\u03bd\u2212 peaks present\nin the transforms (see, e.g., Fig. 9).\nThere are a few items of note from this table. First, every model with steady accretion yields a negative superhump\nsignal if the disc is tilted, and the higher the mass ratio, the\nhigher the negative superhump frequency in cycles per orbit.\nThe fractional amplitudes of the negative superhumps in the\nwith-stream case varies within a range of roughly \u223c0.6 to\n1.4%, and those in the no-stream case vary within the range\n\u223c0.17 to 1.1%. The fractional amplitudes in the with-stream\ncase do not appear to vary in a well-defined way in the range\nof q where positive superhumps are present simultaneously,\nbut they grow monatonically with q for simulations without\nsimultaneous superhumps, as already discussed in reference\nto Fig. 10.\nIn the absence of an accretion stream, only systems with\nmass ratios q \u2265 0.30 display a negative superhump signal.\nThe fractional amplitude of the no-stream negative superhump signal rises rapidly from zero for q <\n\u223c 0.25 to \u223c1% for\nq = 0.35, and then falls more gradually to q = 0.75, at which\npoint the peak in the amplitude spectrum is barely above\nthe noise. We propose that the physical reason for this is\na forced driving of the tilt instability mode initially recognized by Lubow (1992). Near q = 0.30, most of the mass in\nthe simulated discs is near the 3:1 resonance orbit, and even\nat q = 0.40, the outer disc particles complete \u223c3 orbits per\nnegative superhump cycle, thus periodic disipation can take\nplace. This driving becomes increasingly weaker as the outer\ndisc particles move further from the resonance orbit. Note\nthat although for q \u223c 0.35 the fractional amplitude of the\nno-stream case can be larger than that of the with-stream\ncase (which must of course also include the no-stream contribution), this is simply the result of division by the lower\nmean light levels for the smoothed no-stream light curves\n(see, e.g., Fig. 7).\n<\nSystems in the mass-ratio range 0.03 <\n\u223c q \u223c 0.35 are unstable to positive superhump oscillations. We have run a\nq = 0.025 simulation out to orbit 1000 and no superhumps\n\ndeveloped, confirming the lower bound we determined in\nSimpson & Wood (1998). Interestingly, but not surprisingly,\nthe upper bound appears to be a function of mass ratio.\nThe tabulated results show that for q = 0.35, the \u03b1 = 1.5,\n\u03b2 = 0.0 simulation, positive superhumps develop, whereas\nthey do not develop for the higher-viscosity \u03b1 = 1.5, \u03b2 = 0.5\nsimulation which was run out to orbit 500. However, once\nthe equilibrium disc at orbit 200 is tilted, we find positive superhumps clearly developing in the no-stream post-tilt evolution at roughly orbit 240, resulting in a clear peak in the\nFourier transform at \u03bd+ \u2248 0.82 cycles per orbit. The withstream result is less convincing. There is a peak at the same\nlocation in the amplitude spectrum, but it is only about\ntwice the height of the surrounding noise. Finally, we note\nthat in most cases the results for the frequencies of the negative or positive superhumps are not strongly affected by the\nchoice of viscosity over the range we have used.\n\n3.4\n\nRay-Traced Visualizations\n\nIn order to understand better the source of the negative superhump modulation, we visualized and animated\nour results using IDL object graphics. We show still\nframes from these animations in Fig. 11. These and\nother accretion disc animations can be viewed online\nat www.astro.fit.edu/wood/visualizations.html. In the\nfigure, we include representations of the Roche-lobe profiles\nin the orbital plane, the primary star approximately to scale,\nthe line of nodes, and color-code the particles by the luminosity over the previous timestep. The light curves shown\nare ray-traced as described in Paper II \u2013 we sum the energy\ngeneration (Eq. 8) over only the \"surface\" particles along a\ngiven line of sight. The top light curve in the figure corresponds to the i = 0\u25e6 light curve (i.e., as viewed from the\npositive z axis), and the bottom curve corresponds to the\ni = 180\u25e6 light curve. Note that these are anti-phased with respect to each other for both the with-stream and no-stream\ncases, and that the ray-traced light curves only show 1 maximum per superhump cycle. The change in color of the light\ncurves indicates the current time for that frame.\nThe images in the left column of the figure result from\nthe simulation that includes the stream, and shows 1 complete orbit. The right column shows the same orbit for the\nsimulation without the stream. Note that the time value\nshown in the upper right hand corner of each frame is the\ntime in orbits, not in superhump phase. The impact region\nof the accretion stream is visible in the with-stream images\nat times 402.45 and 403.45 (top and bottom panels on the\nleft hand side).\n\n3.5\n\nFits to the Tabulated Results\n\nIn Fig. 12 we show the negative superhump period deficit\nand positive superhump period excess as functions of the\nmass ratio q. The Figure also includes fits to the numerical\nresults.

However, we have checked independent simulation runs with differing values of the viscosity\nparameters (e.g., \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 0.5), smoothing length, and total\nparticle number, and they consistently group near the plotted point. We will discuss possible reasons for this in our\nforthcoming publication presenting the results of our positive superhump parametric study. This is one reason why\nwe emphasize that Eq. 12 is preliminary.\nIn Fig. 13 we plot the magnitude of the ratio \u03c6 =\n|\u03b5\u2212 /\u03b5+ | of the negative superhump period deficit to the\npositive superhump period excess over the mass ratio range\n0.03 \u2264 q \u2264 0.35. As expected from Fig. 12, the ratio is near\nunity for the smallest mass ratios, and declines as mass ratio\nincreases, a result that was hinted at in Fig. 2 of Retter et al.\n\n(2002). Again in Fig. 13 we find that the q = 0.10 point deviates from the trend indicated by the remaining points.\nBecause of this we, offer 3 different linear fits to the results.\nFitting all the data points we obtain\n\u03c6 = 1.033 \u2212 2.16q.\n\n(15)\n\nIf we chose not to include the q = 0.10 point, then the linear\nfit is\n\u03c6 = 1.091 \u2212 2.34q.\n\n(16)\n\nFinally, in consideration of the fact that negative superhumps are primarily only observed in longer-period systems\n(i.e., above the period gap), we have a fit to the points in\nthe range 0.10 \u2264 q \u2264 0.35,\n\u03c6 = 0.837 \u2212 1.37q.\n\n(17)\n\nUp to this point we have presented our results as a\nfunction of mass ratio, because that is the fundamental parameter in the simulations. However, the mass ratio is much\nmore difficult to measure observationally than orbital or superhump periods, and so in Fig. 14 we show the negative\n(positive) superhump period deficit (excess) as a function\nof Porb , where we used the modified Patterson et al. (2005)\nsecondary mass-radius relation (Eq. 10) to scale our mass\nratios to periods, assuming that the white dwarf primary\nmass is M1 = 0.8M\u2299 . This empirical mass-radius relation\nyields a minimum Porb , and for this reason we confine our\nfits to mass ratios of q \u2265 0.10. These relations should help\nguide observers to determine if a putative photometric period detection is plausibly the result the negative super-\n\n\f10\n\nM. A. Wood et al.\n\nFigure 12.

The data are presented graphically\nin Fig. 15. In the figure, the solid circles represent the negative superhump period deficits, and the open circles the\nperiod excesses. While most of the reported period deficits\nare found near the best-fit relationship we find from our\nnumerical results, a handful of the observed period deficits\nare quite discrepant. In general the systems require very long\nphotometric time series observations over a period of a week\nor more and at multiple longitudes for best results. It may\nbe useful to revisit several of these systems to determine if\nthe published period deficits can be confirmed.\nNegative superhumps have been tentatively identified\nin a handful of additional systems, but we did not include\nthese systems in Table 2 and Fig. 15.

The scatter in their phaseresolved spectroscopy suggests an orbital period near 2 hr,\nbut the value is not well determined.

(2006) were\nable to confirm the published value of the orbital period\nand were not able to confirm any of the periods reported by\nAk, Retter, & Liu (2005a). The long-period system TX Col\nwas claimed to potentially show both positive and negative\nsuperhumps by Retter, Liu, & Bos (2005) based on singlesite data, however they warn that their observations need\nconfirmation.\n\n4.2\n\nV1159 Ori and ER UMa\n\nPatterson et al. (1995) show evidence of a 82.7-min periodicity in V1159 Ori which occured on two separate nights,\nand they identify this as a negative superhump signal. Using the spectroscopically-determined Porb = 89.5363 min\n(Thorstensen et al. 1997), this yields a period deficit of\n\u22127.6%, where we'd expect a value closer to \u03b5\u2212 \u223c \u22121.6%\nbased on our results. Similarly, Gao et al. (1999) and\nZhao et al. (2006) report finding negative superhumps in ER\nUMa also with a very large period deficit of \u03b5\u2212 = \u22127.5%.\nHere the period is found to vary night-to-night, and the run\n\n\f12\n\nM. A. Wood et al.\n\nlengths are short. If these signals can be confirmed, then\nthey are perhaps the first observed signals at \u03bd+ + \u2206 discussed above in reference to the q = 0.20 with-stream amplitude spectrum (Fig. 9). However, the absence for either\nsystem of a detected signal near what should be the \"true\"\n2\u03bd\u2212 weakens this interpretation. Additional observations are\nclearly needed.\n\n4.3\n\nAM CVn & V1405 Aql\n\nAM CVn is perhaps the best studied of the helium-masstransfer binaries, and the prototype for the class (Nelemans\n2005). The most extensive photometric study to date for this\nobject is that of Skillman et al. (1999). The positive superhump excess is \u03b5+ = 2.2%, which using Eq. (14) above yields\na mass ratio estimate of q \u2248 0.08. Skillman et al. (1999) report \u03b5\u2212 = \u22121.7% for AM CVn, which from Eq. (13) above\nyields an estimate of q \u2248 0.06. These estimates are consistent\nwith each other and with previous estimates based the observed q versus \u03b5+ relationship (e.g. Patterson et al. 1995).\nHowever, more recently, Roelofs et al. (2006) presented the\nresults of an extensive time-series spectroscopic study of AM\nCVn in which they find a kinematic feature that appears\nanalogous to the \"central spike\" feature observed in some\nlonger period AM CVn stars. If, as in these other systems,\nthe observed central spike of the He II 4471 line traces the\nprojected velocity and phase of the accreting white dwarf,\nthen q = 0.18\u00b10.01 for AM CVn (Roelofs et al. 2006), which\nis substantially higher than the q inferred from the superhump signals. Pearson (2007) explores the possibility that\nhelium discs in AM CVn systems may have pressure effects\noperating in their discs that differ significantly from those\ncharacteristic of hydrogen-dominated discs, and this coupled with possible differing secondary star formation channels for these systems (see, e.g., Roelofs, Nelemans, & Groot\n2007; Yungelson 2008) may preclude the existance of a welldefined superhump period excess to mass ratio relationship.\nHowever, other AM CVn stars with measured superhump\nand orbital periods generally appear to be consistent with\nthe hydrogen-disc results, so additional effort is required to\nresolve these issues.\nV1405 Aql is a LMXB first discovered as an X-ray\nsource exhibiting type-I bursts, suggesting a neutron-star\nprimary (see Retter et al. 2002, and references therein). Observations indicate an optical period about 1% longer than\nthe 0.834-h X-ray orbital period, consistent with common\nsuperhumps, and Retter et al. (2002) report the detection of\na periodicity 0.828 h, which they claim to result from negative superhumps. Thus, for V1405 Aql the negative superhump period deficit is \u03b5\u2212 = 0.71% which implies q = 0.021\nusing Eq. (13) above, and the positive superhump period\nexcess is \u03b5+ = 0.90%, for which Eq. (14) implies q = 0.033.\nFor a 1.4 M\u2299 neutron star primary, these results suggest\na secondary mass in the range 0.03\u20130.05 M\u2299 , and because\nwe find positive superhumps only for q \u2265 0.03, we would\nsuggest the secondary star has a mass near 0.05 M\u2299 . Given\nthe discrepency for AM CVn between the spectroscopicallydetermined mass ratio and that inferred from the superhump\nperiods, the above determinations must of course be taken\nas preliminary.\n\n5\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe report on the results of an extensive parametric study of\nnegative superhumps using the method of smoothed particle hydrodynamics. Negative superhumps are visible when a\ncataclysmic variable system has a disc which is tilted out of\nthe orbital plane. Torques operating on the tilted accretion\ndisc cause it to precess in the retrograde direction, at a rate\nthat increases with system mass ratio q.\nOur results reveal that the negative superhump signal\nis dominated by the transit of the accretion stream impact\nspot across the face of the tilted disc. The deeper in the\nprimary's potential well the impact point on the face of the\ntilted disc, the brighter the instantaneous luminosity. Simulations with mass ratios spanning the range 0.01 \u2264 q \u2264 0.75\nand non-zero accretion rates through L1 produce a negative\nsuperhump signal in the light curve. The signals are antiphased for observers on opposite sides of the orbital plane.\nThe most surprising finding of this project was the discovery of the existence of a negative superhump signal in\nsimulations for which the accretion stream had been shut off\ncompletely. This previously unknown and unsuspected effect\nis only present in simulations with q >\n\u223c 0.30. The signal has\na fractional amplitude that peaks at \u223c1% for q \u2248 0.35, and\nfalls gradually with increasing q. We propose that the source\nof this signal is dissipation associated with forced driving of\nthe 3 : 1 vertical resonance identified by Lubow (1992). The\ndriving is strongest for lower mass ratios as these have most\nof the mass (particles) in the region of the 3:1 resonance.\nThe driving gets weaker with increasing q as the driving\nfrequency pulls away from the response frequency.\nWe give empirical fits to our simulation results which\nshould be useful to observers working to identify negative\nsuperhumps in nature. While most published negative superhump period deficits are in reasonable agreement with\nour numerical simulation results, a handful are in serious\ndisagreement. Because the physics of retrograde disc precession as it applies to these systems is likely to yield intrinsically small scatter about a well-defined trend, we suggest\nthat it may be useful to observe the outlier systems with\nglobal campaigns in an effort to reduce the observational\nscatter. If, however, new observations unambiguously confirm the large negative superhump period deficits reported\nfor these systems, then perhaps the physics of photometric\nsignal generation from tilted accretion discs in cataclysmic\nvariable systems is even more interesting and complex than\nwe currently know.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe lead author was on sabbatical from the Florida Institute of Technology (FIT) during the period of this work, and\nthanks Radboud University and The Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) for support through Visitor's Grant 040.11.046.
