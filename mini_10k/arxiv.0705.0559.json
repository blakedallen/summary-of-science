As\nthe wave travels through the simulation grid, a shock-bounded spherical shell is formed. The inner\nshock of this shell reaches and bounces off the center, leaving behind a central core with an initially\nalmost uniform density distribution, surrounded by an envelope consisting of the material in the shockbounded shell, with a power-law density profile that at late times approaches a logarithmic slope of \u22122\neven in non-collapsing cases. The central core and the envelope are separated by a mild shock. The\nresulting density structure resembles a quiescent core of radius . 0.1 pc, with a Bonnor-Ebert-like\n(BE-like) profile, although it has significant dynamical differences: it is initially non-self-gravitating\nand confined by the ram pressure of the infalling material, and consequently, growing continuously in\nmass and size. With the appropriate parameters, the core mass eventually reaches an effective Jeans\nmass, at which time the core begins to collapse, until finally a singularity is formed. Thus, there is\nnecessarily a time delay between the appearance of the core and the onset of its collapse, but this is not\ndue to the dissipation of its internal turbulence as it is often believed, but rather to the time necessary\nfor it to reach its Jeans mass. These results suggest that pre-stellar cores may approximate BonnorEbert structures which are however of variable mass and may or may not experience gravitational\ncollapse, in qualitative agreement with the large observed frequency of cores with BE-like profiles. In\nour collapsing simulations, a time \u223c 0.5 Myr typically elapses between the formation of the core and\nthe time at which it becomes gravitationally unstable, and another \u223c 0.5 Myr are necessary for it to\ncomplete the collapse.\nSubject headings: ISM: clouds - ISM: evolution - ISM: structure - stars: formation - turbulence\nFor example, based on observations of CS(3-2), CS(2-1),\nDCO+ (2-1) and N2 H+ (1-0), Lee et al.

INTRODUCCION\n\n\f2\npersonically turbulent, since they exhibit supersonic\nlinewidths (Zuckerman & Palmer 1974), and MC cores,\nas well as their parent MCs themselves, have been\nsuggested to be turbulent density fluctuations within\ntheir environments (Sasao 1973; Elmegreen 1993;\nBallesteros-Paredes et al. 1999), being produced by\neffectively supersonic compressions. Hunter & Fleck\n(1982) showed that the effective Jeans mass of a fluid\nparcel subject to an external compressive velocity field is\nsignificantly decreased with respect to its normal static\nvalue. Furthermore, V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. (2005)\nhave recently pointed out that, if MCs are isothermal\nthroughout,4 then the hot, tenuous medium necessary to\nconfine and stabilize a hydrostatic equilibrium configuration is not available, and the equilibrium state is then\nexpected to be unstable in general.\nThis leads naturally to the question of whether hydrostatic equilibrium configurations can be produced in such\nturbulent conditions, and if so, how do they arrive at that\nstate. Otherwise, if the entire process is dynamic, one\ncan ask what is the density and velocity structure of the\ncores at the time they engage into collapse and, if different from the initial conditions normally assumed, what\neffects does it have on the evolution. Moreover, if the\ncore is formed and induced to collapse by a compressive\nwave, then in general there is an inflow that builds up the\ncore dynamically, and the mass that ends up collapsing is\nnot previously determined by the initial conditions, but\nrather is determined \"on the spot\" depending on the local\ninstantaneous conditions. The studies of collapse mentioned above cannot answer these questions, since they\nalready assume gravitationally unstable structures, and\ninitial hydrostatic equilibrium configurations, so that all\nof the mass is involved in the collapse.\nA study that comes close to these goals is that by\nHennebelle et al. (2003), who investigated the effect of\nincreasing in the pressure external Pext to an initially\nstable BE sphere. They noted that the resulting configurations are a good match to the observations because\nthe density profile is flat at the center, and the prestellar\nphase is characterized by subsonic inwards velocities at\nthe outskirts, and by nearly zero velocity at the inner\nparts. However, having a hot confining medium outside\nand an initial hydrostatic profile, this study still could\nnot capture the core formation part of the evolution,\nand predetermined the mass that collapses from the initial conditions. Also, it did not consider the possibility of\na transient compression and thus of a failure to collapse.\nA brief discussion of the dynamic scenario of core formation has been given by Whitworth et al. (2007) in the\ncontext of the formation of cores that give birth to brown\ndwarfs. These authors have suggested that the dynamic\nformation of cores should involve a mass growth period\nand the confinement of BE-like structures by ram pressure of external infalling material.\nIn view of the above, in this paper we then present numerical hydrodynamical simulations in spherical coordinates of transient compressions in homogeneous, initially\ngravitationally stable regions, with the purpose of inves4 The possibility that MCs may contain warmer atomic gas\ninterspersed with the colder molecular gas has been recently raised\nby Hennebelle & Inutsuka (2006). If this turns out to be the case,\nthen the argument against the feasibility of stable hydrostatic BElike MC cores weakens significantly.\n\ntigating the formation of cores embedded in turbulent\nmolecular clouds. In particular, we focus on the evolution of its density and velocity profiles, the timescales\nrequired for a core to be assembled and then collapse or\nredisperse, and the mechanism by which a certain fraction of the mass is gravitationally \"captured\" to then\nproceed to collapse.\nIn particular, the timescale issue is highly relevant because it is often thought that the prestellar lifetimes of\nthe cores in the turbulent scenario of star formation are\nof the order of one core's free-fall time \u03c4ff . However,\nit has been shown by V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. (2005)\nand Galv\u00e1n-Madrid et al. (2007) that even in highly dynamical, driven-turbulence simulations, the lifetimes are\na few to several times \u03c4ff . It is important then to investigate the detailed evolution of cores formed by turbulent compressions, to understand the reason for those\nobserved timescales.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In \u00a72 we first\ndiscuss the motivation and applicability of the spherical\nsymmetry used in this paper, and then we describe the\nnumerical setup of the problem. In \u00a73 we present the\nresults of two fiducial cases of core evolution, one collapsing and one rebounding, and in \u00a74 we then disccus\nthe implications of our results, and compare with existing observational and theoretical work. Finally, in \u00a75 we\npresent a summary and some concluding remarks.\n2. THE MODEL\n2.1. The need for focused compressions\nThe formation, and subsequent induction to gravitational collapse, of clouds and clumps by compressive velocity fields (as opposed, in particular,\nto collisions of pre-existing clouds) has been studied intensively by numerous workers for more than\nthree decades (e.g., Sasao 1973; Hunter & Fleck 1982;\nTohline et al. 1987; McKee et al. 1993; Elmegreen\n1993; V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. 1996, 2003, 2005, 2007;\nBallesteros-Paredes et al. 1999; Ostriker et al. 1999,\n2001; Klessen et al. 2000; Heitsch et al. 2001; Li et al.\n2004; Tilley & Pudritz 2004, 2005). In such scenario,\nthe formation of cores and stars is in agreement with\nobservational studies that suggest that star formation\nis a rapid and dynamic process (e.g., Lee & Myers\n1999; Ballesteros-Paredes et al. 1999; Elmegreen 2000;\nPringle et al. 2001; Brice\u00f1o et al. 2001; Hartmann et al.\n2001; Ballesteros-Paredes & Hartmann 2007). The ability of a compression to induce collapse is directly related\nto the stability of self-gravitating equilibrium structures,\nwhich in turn depends critically on the geometry of the\nconfigurations and on the effective polytropic exponent\n(\u03b3eff ) of the medium. This exponent describes the response to compressions of a medium subject to heating\nand cooling processes (Tohline et al. 1987; Elmegreen\n1991; V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. 1996), so that the flow\nexhibits an effective polytropic equation of state of the\nform P \u221d \u03c1\u03b3eff .\nThe stability of self-gravitating structures depends\nboth on the geometry and on \u03b3eff because both of them\ninfluence the variation of the ratio J 2 \u2261 |Eg |/Eth upon\ncompressions, where |Eg | is the absolute value of the\ngravitational energy and Eth is the (supporting) internal\nenergy. For example, it is well known that the existence\n\n\f3\nof stable spherical configurations without any external\nconfining agent requires \u03b3eff > 4/3 (Chandrasekhar\n1981, \u00a7117). In this case, J 2 decreases upon a compression, and increases upon an expansion, rendering\nthe equilibrium stable. This behavior is reversed for\n\u03b3eff < 4/3, so that equilibrium configurations are unstable in this case. We refer to the value of \u03b3eff at which\nthe reversal occurs as the critical value, \u03b3eff,c .\nNow, if the compression occurs along \u03bd directions, so\nthat the density increases as L\u03bd , where L is the length\nscale along the direction(s) of compression, then the\nrate of variation of |Eg | and of J 2 with the compression depends on \u03bd and, as a consequence, the critical\nvalue of \u03b3eff also depends on \u03bd. Specifically, one obtains\n(McKee et al. 1993; V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. 1996)\n\u03b3eff,c = 2(1 \u2212 \u03bd \u22121 ).\n\n(1)\n\nThis recovers the value \u03b3eff,c = 4/3 for three-dimensional\n(e.g., spherically symmetric) compressions, as well as the\nwell known fact that planar compressions (\u03bd = 1) cannot induce collapse in isothermal flows (\u03b3eff = 1), since\n\u03b3eff,c = 0 in this case. Equation (1) also shows that the\ninduction of collapse in isothermal media requires compressions in more than two dimensions (\u03bd > 2).\nThese considerations show that useful insight can be\ngained from the analysis of spherically symmetric compressions, like those assumed in this paper, since the\ncompressions that induce the collapse of selected subregions of turbulent, isothermal molecular clouds need\nto be of dimensionality higher than 2. Such compressions are expected to be rare but still existing in general\nsupersonic turbulent regimes, involving a certain degree\nof focusing (or convergence) of the flow. For example,\nWhitworth et al. (2007) appeal to the low but finite\nprobability of such focused compressions to explain the\nscarcity of \u223c 0.01M\u2299 brown dwarfs.\nFinally, note that these convergent flows are in principle different from a simple passing shock (which is essentially a planar compression), although the latter can also\ninduce multidimensional compression when the shock has\na finite transverse extent, producing a flattened structure\nthat then can contract gravitationally in the tranverse\ndirection.\n2.2. The numerical setup\nIn view of the above considerations, in this work we\nconsider an idealized spherical cloud subject to an external compression wave. The simple spherical geometry\nallows us to focus on the basic phenomena related to the\neffects of the compression. Moreover, by considering a\nuniform density distribution and allowing the system to\ndynamically choose the amount of mass involved in the\ncollapse, we avoid some of the restrictions that previous\nwork has imposed on the evolution.\nThe hydrodynamic evolution of this setup was solved\nusing ZEUS (Stone & Norman 1992), a finite difference,\ntime explicit, operator split, hydrodynamic code. The\ncalculations were performed on a 1D spherical grid, with\nthe domain spanning the range 0 < r < 1 pc with 1000\ngrid points spaced such that \u03b4ri+1 /\u03b4ri = 1.005. This\nyields a spatial resolution of \u2248 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 pc at the inner boundary, and \u2248 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 pc at the outer boundary. (Selected simulations were performed with a much\n\nhigher resolution of 4000 grid points and no significant\ndifferences were observed.) The boundary conditions are\n\"reflecting\" at r = 0 and \"outflow\" at r = 1 pc. No\nconfining agents are used whatsoever (closed boundary\nnor hot tenuous medium), implying that mass can freely\nleave the system, although it cannot enter. The absence\nof a confining agent attempts to emulate the situation\nof a density enhancement immersed in a much more extended medium at the same temperature.\nAll simulations started with a constant density distribution, an isothermal equation of state, and a temperature T = 11.4 \u25e6K which, with a mean particle mass\n\u03bc = 2.36 mH , yields an isothermal sound speed cs =\n0.2 km s\u22121 . This setup was perturbed by a compressive\nvelocity pulse given by the relation\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\n0,\n\u0011 r < r0 \u2212 dr0 ;\n\u0010\n\u03c0 r\u2212r0\nv(r) = \u2212v0 sin \u0010 2 dr0 \u0011 , r0 \u2212 dr0 < r < r0 + dr0 ;\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u2212v0 sin \u03c0 r1 \u2212r , r0 + dr0 < r;\n2 dr1\n\n(2)\nwhere v0 and r0 are parameters of the simulation, dr0 =\n0.1 pc, r1 = [rmax + (r0 + dr0 )]/2, and dr1 = [rmax \u2212 (r0 +\ndr0 )]/2, with rmax = 1 pc. A simple self-gravity module\nwas also added to the code.\nOur approach continues along the lines of simple, basic\nmodels that have explored the gravitational collapse of\nMC cores, since Larson (1969) and Penston (1969a,b),\nthrough Hennebelle et al. (2003), which we have extended to include an initial velocity impulse, intended\nto mimic the random compressive motions expected in\na turbulent medium. Nevertheless, the one-dimensional\nnature of the model, together with the adopted spherical geometry, makes this setup somewhat unphysical\nas it restricts the nature of the compressible wave to\nspherical shells, and \"turbulent\" support in this model\nis present only as purely divergent motion, with no rotational component. A more realistic way of modeling\nthe core formation process, albeit perhaps less amenable\nto detailed analysis, would be to perform full 3D numerical simulations, via random compressions of finite\ncross-section generated by bulk motions of the gas, similarly to what has been done for the diffuse medium by\nV\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. (2007). We intend to pursue\nthis in the near future, over the theoretical foundation\nlaid out by the simple present study.\nAnother limitation introduced by the adopted geometry is the large mass of the collapsed core resulting from\nour simulations (cf. \u00a73.2). In a more realistic simulation, without the geometrical and symmetry restrictions,\nthe collapsing system would probably undergo fragmentation. Therefore, we see the collapsed objects generated\nin these simulations not as a single star, but as the precursors of small clusters.\n3. THE SIMULATIONS\n3.1. Spontaneous collapse\n\nIn order to study the effect of velocity fields in inducing the collapse of molecular cloud cores, we first need\nto determine when they can collapse under the influence\nof their self-gravity alone. Because of the adopted spherical geometry (the usual Jeans analysis is applicable to\n\n\f4\n\nFig. 1.- Spontaneous collapse of the cloud without velocity impulse. Left: when started with a constant density n = 175.70 cm\u22123 , the\ncentral region of the cloud undergoes gravitational collapse after a small bounce off the center. Right: when started with a constant density\nn = 112.72 cm\u22123 , the cloud bounces off its center and expands until it disperses.\n\nsinusoidal perturbations in plane parallel geometry), the\ncritical density \u03c1c and mass (which we refer to as the effective Jeans mass) at which the core collapses may differ\nslightly from the standard Jeans values, and so we determine them here numerically. We set v0 = 0 and let the\nsimulation run for 10 Myr with a series of different initial\ndensities.\nAs the simulations are started, self-gravity causes the\ncloud to begin contracting, increasing its mean density\n(see fig. 1). At some point, the pressure gradient in the\ninner parts stops this process and the contraction is reversed (the cloud \"bounces\" momentarily). If the cloud's\nmass is large enough, self-gravity takes over again, the\nexpansion is also reversed and the cloud collapses; otherwise, the expansion continues until the simulation ends.\nIt is found that an initial density value of 160 cm\u22123 yields\na collapsing core, while a 2% lower density does not;\ntherefore, we take the critical density as \u03c1c = 160 cm\u22123 .\nAt this density, the mass in our numerical box (of radius R = 1 pc) is Mbox (\u03c1c ) = 39.1M\u2299 . For comparison,\nthe mean density for which the standard Jeans length\nequals the diameter of the numerical domain (2 pc) is\n\u03c1\u0304 = \u03c1J \u2261 \u03c0c2s /GL2J = 125 cm\u22123 .\nIn the light of this result, we define the effective Jeans\nmass as the spherical Jeans mass (i.e., a sphere with diameter equal to the Jeans length at mean density \u03c1\u0304) times\na fudge factor A so that the product equals the box's\nmass at the empirical critical density:\n\u00133\nLJ\n2\n\u0012 2 \u00133/2\n5/2\ncs\n\u03c0\n\u03c1c\u22121/2 ,\n=A\n6\nG\n\nMJ,eff = A\n\n4\u03c0\u03c1c\n3\n\n\u0012\n\n(3)\n\nwhere kB is the Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, \u03bc = 2.36 mH is mean particle mass, and G is the\ngravitational constant. By setting MJ,eff = Mbox , we obtain A = 1.45. For comparison, the standard Jeans mass\n\nat \u03c1c is MJ = 27.0M\u2299 , and the BE mass (Ebert 1955;\n\u00011/2\n= 10.0M\u2299.\nBonnor 1956) is MBE = 1.18c3s / G3 \u03c1c\n\n3.2. Cores formed by ram-pressure\nAlthough a large number of simulations were performed, our discusion will focus on two of them, respectively representative of non-collapsing and collapsing\ncases. We shall call S1 the simulation with the initial velocity impulse at r0 = 0.33 pc, while simulation S2 places\nthe impulse at r0 = 0.67 pc. Both simulations have the\nsame velocity amplitude (v0 = 0.4 km s\u22121 = 2cs ) and\nsub-critical initial density (112.7 cm\u22123 \u2248 0.7\u03c1c ), meaning\nthat in the absence of compressive motions, both simulations would simply expand away.\nThe evolution of simulation S1 is shown in Figure 2.\nThis figure respectively shows, as a function of radius,\nthe density, the logarithmic slope of the density radial\nprofile, the velocity, and the core's mass (solid line) and\nJeans mass (dashed line) inside the radius, in the four\nrows from top to bottom at selected times (left to right\ncolumns). Shortly after the starting time (t \u2248 0.28 Myr),\na shell bounded by two shocks appears on the inner side\nof the initial velocity pulse, at log r \u2248 \u22120.7 (r \u2248 0.2\npc). The formation of these two shocks and the shell between them is due to the middle parts of the compressive\nwave, which have the highest velocities, catching up with\nthe frontal parts of the wave, causing the formation of\na shock, which splits into two shocks receding from each\nother and leaving the shock-bounded layer in between.\nThe innermost one of these shocks propagates inward,\nleaving a large amount of inflowing mass behind it (fig.\n2b). As it travels toward the center of the cloud (t \u2248 0.77\nMyr), geometrical focusing dramatically increases the internal density, lowering the effective Jeans mass of the\ninner parts of the cloud (fig. 2c). As the shock bounces\noff the center and expands outwards, the shocked gas\nbehind it is left at uniform density and at essentially\nzero velocity; that is, a quiescent core is formed, with\nthe shock-bounded shell dubbing as the core's envelope\n\n\f5\n\nFig. 2.- Evolution of simulation S1. Each row shows the evolution (down from the top) of density (n), logarithmic density\nslope (d log n/d log r), velocity (vr ), mass internal to radius r (M (r), solid line) and effective Jeans mass (MJ,eff , dashed line) at\n0.000 (column a), 0.625 (b), 0.775 (c), 0.925 (d), and 1.500 Myr (e). Arrows show the direction of motion of the shocks.

The gas from the shock-bounded shell continues\nto fall in, being incorporated into the quiescent core as\nit passes through the inner shock. Although the mass\nof the quiescent core increases, its density is somewhat\nlowered because of a mild expasion of the compressed region. As a result, the Jeans mass becomes larger in the\ninnermost parts of the core, and decreases close to the\nshock-bounded layer and within it [compare panels (d)\nand (e) of fig. 2]. As the core acquires more mass, its\ndensity profile starts to deviate from being uniform, and\nto approach that of a truncated BE sphere. However, in\nthis simulation the mass of the inner core never becomes\nequal to MJ,eff at any radius, and the uniform-density\n\n(See caption in fig.\n\n2).\n\n[See\n\ncore begins to expand indefinitely, developing positive\nvelocities at the outermost regions first (fig. 2e).\nIn simulation S2, the early evolution is quite similar to\nthat of S1. At t \u2248 1.5 Myr, the inner shock bounding\nthe layer bounces off the center of the core (fig. 3c) and\nbegins traveling outwards. But then, some 0.5 Myr later\n(t \u2248 2.0 Myr), the amount of mass in the core finally becomes equal to MJ,eff (d) at r \u2248 0.07 pc, and from that\nmoment on, collapse ensues, culminating with the formation of a singularity at t \u2248 2.6 Myr (e). It is interesting\nthat at t \u2248 2.0 Myr, the mean density in the quiescent\ncore is n \u2248 2.85 \u00d7 104 cm\u22123 , implying a free-fall time\n\u03c4ff \u2248 0.2 Myr, less than half the time the actual collapse\n\n\f6\ntakes. There are several reasons possibly responsible for\nthe discrepancy with the observed collapse time of 0.6\nMyr (from t = 2 Myr to t = 2.6 Myr). For example,\nit was already noted by Larson (1969, Appendix C)\nthat the actual collapse time lasts nearly 1.5 times the\nfree-fall time, because the pressure gradient is never negligible. The remaining difference is probably due to the\nimprecisions introduced by considering the mean density\nrather than the detailed radial distribution, and the fact\nthat the core is increasing its mass, so that the instability\nsets in at an undetermined radius.\nA very interesting feature of both simulations is the\nfact that the density structure of the core+envelope system resembles a BE sphere during the period over which\nthe shock front is traveling outwards (figs. 2e and 3d),\nat which times the innermost parts of the core have a\nnearly constant density and the shock-bounded layer approaches an r\u22122 density profile. After the formation of\nthe singularity at the center, the r\u22122 density profile extends throughout the core, similarly to an SIS profile (fig.\n3e).\nIt is worth remarking that, even though the idealized\ngeometry and initial conditions adopted in this paper\nshould not have a strong impact on the general qualitative behavior of these simulations, the above quoted\nsizes and time-scales are expected to depend on these details. In fact, the outcome of the simulation (collapse or\nre-expansion) already depends sensitively on the parameters of our idealized simulations. For example, the only\ndifference between simulations S1 and S2 is the initial\nposition of the compressive pulse. Moreover, a simulation similar to S1 but started with v0 = 3cs and a lower\ninitial density (88.8 cm\u22123 ) collapses 0.4 Myr after the initial shock bounces off the center. That is, a lower initial\nmean density can be counterbalanced by a larger compressive Mach number, in the quest for inducing collapse.\nNevertheless, this simulation still goes through the same\nqualitative evolution as simulation S2. For these reasons,\nthe results presented in this section can be regarded as\na qualitative description of the formation and evolution\nof molecular cloud cores, while more quantitative analysis requires more realistic simulations involving multidimensional compressions, and it is left for future work.\n4. DISCUSSION\n4.1. Generality of shock-bounded self-gravitating\n\nstructures\nThe formation of growing shock-bounded structures is\nnot exclusive to the spherical symmetry used in this paper. Planar compressions are generally known to produce\nshock-bounded layers in both isothermal and radiativelycooling flows. The one-dimensional plane-parallel problem is equivalent to that of a shock front hitting a wall\nand then reflecting off it, and thus by construction the\ngas between the wall and the shock is at rest, with the\nshock front receding from the wall at the post-shock velocity of the flow. The shocked layer increases its mass\nas gas from the incoming flow is incorporated into it after crossing the bounding shock. The shock bounded\nlayer is thus the planar equivalent of our spherical-shockbounded quiescent core. The plane-parallel problem has\nbeen worked out analytically in 1D and numerically in\ntwo or three dimensions by Folini & Walder (2006) for\n\nthe isothermal case and by Hennebelle & P\u00e9rault (1999)\nand V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. (2006) for the thermally\nbistable case. The main difference with the spherical case\nis that plane-parallel compressions in thermally bistable\nmedia (such as the warm HI gas) can induce gravitational\ncollapse (Hunter at al. 1986; V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al.\n2007) because in this case the flow behaves effectively\nas if having \u03b3eff < 0, while in an isothermal medium\nfocused (i.e., multidimensional) compressions are necessary because in this case \u03b3eff = 1 (see \u00a72.1). However, the planar and the spherically symmetric cases\nare qualitatively similar in that both involve the formation of a shock-bounded structure that grows in mass\nby accretion through the shock until it becomes gravitationally unstable and begins contracting. In the planar compression case, this process has been modeled numerically by various workers (e.g., Hunter at al. 1986;\nV\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. 2007).\n4.2. Implications\nThe evolution of simulation S2 has a number of interesting important implications, which we now discuss.\nFirst, a compressive wave (or a negative-divergence velocity field) does not directly induce the collapse of an\ninitially sub-Jeans core. The collapse happens only if\nat some point in the evolution the mass becomes larger\nthan the Jeans mass. In all the collapsing simulations we\nhave performed here, this occurs only after the resulting\nshock front has rebounded off the center, traveled outwards, and incorporated a large enough amount of mass\ninto the central core, so that a \"traditional\" Jeans criterion for collapse [M (r) > MJ,eff ] is satisfied there. Since\nthe material behind the shock is left at zero velocity, no\nturbulent support is ever at play there. That is, the collapse does not occur because turbulence is dissipated in\nthe core, as it is often believed, but rather because the\ngrowing core eventually reaches the effective Jeans mass.\nMoreover, as the shock continues to move outwards, the\nsize of the region acquiring the effective Jeans mass increases, so that the determination of the mass that is\nsubsequently incorporated into the collapse happens \"on\nthe spot\" in a highly fortuitous manner.\nSecond, a near r\u22122 density profile is approached at\nlate times in the infalling envelope around the central\ncore, both in collapsing and non-collapsing cases. The\ncentral core, in turn, evolves from a near-flat density\nprofile to that of a truncated BE sphere as its mass increases. The central core and the envelope are separated\nby the outwards-traveling shock, which is, however, very\nmild, with a Mach number very close to unity. Thus, the\ncore+envelope system may easily be taken for a single\nstructure with a density profile resembling that of a BE\nsphere.\nThird, the velocity profile of the central core at all\ntimes after it has formed, has nearly zero velocity\nthroughout. This provides a physical basis for the existence of quiescent (subsonic non-thermal velocity dispersion) and coherent (non-thermal velocity dispersion\nnearly constant through the core) cores, which in the turbulent model of core formation are the stagnation points\nof the turbulent flow in molecular clouds (Klessen et al.\n2005).\nFourth, there is a time delay between the formation\nof the core and its gravitational collapse. The quiescent\n\n\f7\ncore grows from the center as the shock moves outwards\nincorporating mass into the central shocked region. This\nprocess cannot happen instantaneously, but rather requires a finite time until the core's mass equals the effective Jeans mass. In our simulations, roughly 1 Myr\nspans from the moment of central core formation to the\ndevelopment of a singularity at the center, with roughly\nhalf of it being spent without any tendency to collapse.\nThis time delay naturally explains the high frequency of\nobserved starless cores with BE-like profiles.\nFifth, it is important to remark that even though\nour quiesecent cores are morphologically similar to BE\nspheres, they are dynamically very different: they are\nnot confined by the thermal pressure of a hot, tenuous\nmedium, but instead are confined by the ram-pressure of\nthe inflowing gas from the envelope, and growing in size\nand mass accordingly, until they become dominated by\ngravity, at which point they engage into collapse.\nSixth, and finally, it appears that the whole evolution\nis not very amenable to a similarity solution because: a)\nthe initial velocity pulse is finite, so that the external flow\nis not rescalable. b) The inner shock bounding the shockbounded shell hits the center and bounces back towards\nthe exterior so the time of collision at the center breaks\nthe self-similarity. c) The central core gradually increases\nits self-gravity and eventually may become gravitationally unstable, a process that continously transforms the\ncore's density profile from uniform to being BE-like, first\nstable and then unstable. Similarity solutions may be\nmost applicable after the formation of the central singularity, as originally suggested by Shu (1977).\n4.3. Comparison with previous work\nIt is interesting to put the results of our numerical simulations in context with those of previous studies. The\nmain difference is that our simulations have investigated\nthe formation of the cores in addition to their subsequent\ncollapse, in order to study whether BE-like structures can\nbe spontaneously produced out of supersonic turbulent\ncompressions in isothermal molecular clouds. Thus, in\nparticular, our study sheds light on the realizability of\nthe initial conditions used by previous works.\nOur results suggest that in fully isothermal molecular clouds (i.e., without a warm, tenuous interclump\nmedium that can stabilize a density enhancement), collapsing structures formed by random turbulent compressions in the medium morphologically resemble BE\nspheres through a large fraction of their evolution, because they consist of a central core and an infalling envelope which, at late times after the formation of the central core, has a density profile with a slope close to \u22122.\nThis extends previous results that plane-of-sky angular\naveraging and line-of-sight averaging cause the observed\ndensity profiles to be smoother that the actual ones and\neasily confused with BE ones (Ballesteros-Paredes et al.\n2003; Hartmann 2004). Also at late times, near the onset\nof gravitational collapse of the core, the latter also develops a density profile close to that of a BE sphere, which\nconnects with that of the envelope. This means that,\nat the onset of gravitational collapse, our simulations favor initial conditions for collapse such as those used by\nFoster & Chevalier (1993), albeit with the added ingredient of a continuous accretion at the bounding shock.\nThe establishment of a near r\u22122 density profile in the\n\nenvelope at late times is interesting in the context of the\ndiscussion by Shu (1977). He points out that the development of such a profile requires that the initial motions\nin the outer regions of collapsing cores be subsonic, so\nthat all fluid parcels are in acoustic contact with each\nother, and can therefore approach detailed mechanical\nbalance. In our simulations, however, this need for an initially subsonic condition appears to be in contradiction\nwith the supersonic nature of the initial pulse. However,\nthe acoustic contact is restored in the envelope because\nit consists of shocked gas that has been thermalized and\nthus initially subsonic. The fact that a near-r\u22122 profile\ndevelops in the envelope even in the non-collapsing simulation can be understood because the compressive pulse\neffectively removes the support for the outer layers, analogously to the effect of an inside-out collapse.\nSome authors have already studied spherically symmetric flows with shocks in the context of protostar\nformation using similarity methods (e.g., Shen & Lou\n2004; Lou & Gao 2006; Lou & Wang 2006). Similarity\nstudies are extremely useful in extracting the underlying\nasymptotic behavior of real flows. Therefore, it is important to compare our numerical solutions with existing\nsimilarity solutions of self-gravitating clouds in the presence of shocks, in particular those of Shen & Lou (2004,\nherefater SL04), whose study most resembles our numerical setup. These authors presented two possible classes\nof self-similar shocked flow in the context of the dynamical evolution of protostars, depending on the asymptotic behavior of the solutions near the center of cloud.\nTheir Class I solutions had negative (inflow) velocities\n(\u221d \u2212r1/2 ), a density profile \u03c1 \u221d r\u22123/2 , and finite mass as\nasymptotic limits at r \u2192 0, while their Class II had positive (expansion) velocity (\u221d r), constant finite density\nand vanishing mass (\u221d r3 ) as the asymptotic behavior in\nthe same limit. In both classes, an outward-moving shock\nseparates a collapsing (or expanding) inner part and an\naccreting outer part. None of these behaviors are seen in\nour simulations at any time. Their Class II is similar to\nour solutions during the core-growth stage, in that it has\na uniform central density and an accreting outer part,\nwhich has a counterpart in the infalling shock-bounded\nlayer in our models. However, in our system the central\ncore is neither expanding nor contracting, but rather it\nis at rest. This difference is most likely a consequence\nof self-gravity being neglegible in our cores during the\nearly stages of their evolution. That is, unlike the SL04\nsolution, where self-gravity is important at all radii and\nat all times, in our simulations the relative importance of\nself-gravity increases secularly with time, going from being zero at the time of core formation to being dominant\nat the time when gravitational instability sets in.\nAnother recent study that is closely related to ours is\nthat by Hennebelle et al. (2003), who numerically investigated the effect of increasing the pressure external Pext\nto an initially stable BE sphere. These authors found\nthat slow rates of increase of Pext cause the sphere to\napproach instability quasi-statically, but higher rates of\nincrease produced a compressive wave that triggers an\noutside-in collapse. It is noteworthy, however, that they\ndo not report the bounce of the compressive wave from\nthe center that we find. This is most probably because,\nin their case, the wave compresses a previously-existing\n\n\f8\ncore that is in a (fragile) stable hydrostatic equilibrium\nstate, and so the role of the wave is to directly trigger\nthe collapse. Instead, in our case, the compressive wave\nforms the core, and adds mass to it until it becomes\ngravitationally unstable and proceeds to collapse. Moreover, in the case of Hennebelle et al. (2003), the mass\nof the core was fixed, being bounded by a hot, tenuous medium, while in our case, the fraction of the mass\nthat is driven to collapse is determined \"in real time\" by\nthe interplay between the accreting gas and the outgoing\nshock wave, and moreover the mass that becomes gravitationally unstable increases with time, so the collapse\nproceeds \"inside out\" but over an intermediate range of\nradii. Thus, we see that the choice of equilibrium or\nout-of-equilibrium initial conditions and continuous or\ndiscontinuous boundary conditions leads to very different patterns of evolution. Which model applies best to\nactual turbulent molecular clouds probably depends on\nwhether they consist of a single, nearly isothermal molecular phase (our model), or of a mixture of colder, denser\nmolecular cloudlets immersed in a more tenuous and\nwarmer atomic medium (Hennebelle & Inutsuka 2006).\nExtensive theoretical and observational work, focusing\nespecially on the velocity structure of the cores, is needed\nto decide on this issue. The recent results of Lee et al.\n(2007), indicating the presence of a sharp infall velocity increase at \u223c 0.03 pc from the centers of the starless\ncores L694-2 and L1197, would seem to favor our dynamical scenario for the formation of the cores.\nFinally, our results are fully consistent with the scenario outlined by Whitworth et al. (2007). These authors have foreseen the formation of evolving BE spheres\nbounded and fed by the accretion of external infalling\nmaterial, which can collapse if the core eventually reaches\nthe BE mass. Although they restricted their discussion\nto the formation of brown dwarf-producing cores, the\nsimulations described here are seen to be applicable to\nthe formation of cores of arbitrary mass. It is indeed\nlikely that, as the core to be formed is of smaller mass, the\nrequired compression and focusing need to be stronger,\nas the initial conditions will have sizes much smaller than\nthe local Jeans length (cf. \u00a73.2).\n5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have performed a numerical study\nof the formation of dense cores by dynamical compressions in isothermal, non-magnetized media, using simple\none-dimensional calculations in spherical geometry. Our\nresults show that cores assembled by this process consist\nof a central, quiescent core with density 105 cm\u22123 that\ngrows in mass and size as it accretes mass from a surrounding envelope. The quiescent core and the envelope\nare separated by a mild shock with Mach number just\nabove unity, and the accretion from the envelope provides\nram-pressure that confines the central quiescent, growing\ncore. As the central core increases its mass, it passes first\nthrough a neglegible-gravity, uniform-density stage, and\nlater, as self-gravity becomes important, it evolves into a\n\n\"pseudo BE-sphere\" stage. If at some point in the evolution, the mass of the core-envelope becomes lager than\nthe Jeans mass, the core proceeds to collapse. Otherwise,\nit begins to reexpand. Even in collapsing cases, this process requires a relatively long time to complete, taking\n\u223c 0.5 Myr from the first appearance of the central core\nto the time at which it becomes gravitationally unstable, and another \u223c 0.5 Myr for the collapse to produce\na singularity at the center.\nAt all times after the formation of the central core,\nthe combined density structure of the core+envelope\nsystem resembles that of a BE sphere, since it is flattened at the center, and has an envelope that approaches\nan r\u22122 density profile at late times. Moreover, the\ncentral core is quiescent at all times, except for the\nvery late stages of the non-collapsing case, in which the\ncore begins to expand. Thus, the high observed frequency of BE-like profiles (e.g. di Francesco et al. 2007;\nLada et al. 2007) and quiescent/coherent velocity dispersion structure (Myers 1983; Goodman et al. 1998;\nCaselli et al. 2002; Tafalla et al. 2002; Tafalla et al.\n2004; Schnee et al. 2007) is naturally accomodated in\nthis scenario of dynamic assembly of MC cores, as suggested also by studies of dense cores in turbulent simulations of 3D, isothermal molecular clouds Klessen et al.\n(2005). However, the structures are not classical BE\nspheres, because they are confined by ram-pressure,\nrather than by thermal pressure, and are consequently\naccreting mass and growing in mass, size, and selfgravitating energy, in a process qualitatively similar\nto that described for the formation of giant MCs by\nV\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. (2007). In both cases, there\nis a secular evolution, characterized by the mass increase\nof the cloud or core.\nThe velocity structure of the cores formed in our simulations appears consistent with recent radiative transfer\nmodels for the structure of cores L694-2 and L1197 presented by Lee et al. (2007), which exhibit a nearly zero\ncentral velocity and a sharp rise at radii \u223c 0.03 pc. We\nplan to carry out a radiative transfer study of the density and velocity structures produced by our models in\nthe near future, in order to perform detailed comparisons\nwith observational studies based on multi-tracer studies (e.g. Lee et al. 2004) as well as on line-profile mapping of prestellar cores (e.g., Tafalla et al. 1998, 2004;\nLee et al. 1999, 2007; Schnee et al. 2007).\nWe wish to thank S.
