As L\u00e9vy-Leblond has shown,\nit is also the velo ity that would be imputed by an ideal Newtonian inertial guidan e system, taking\nc = 1 neper=1. Here, we show that it an also be interpreted as the hange in musi al pit h of\nradiation fore and aft along the dire tion of motion.\n\nDepartment of Mathemati s\nBrigham Young University\nProvo, Utah, USA\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe usual one-dimensional relativisti velo ity addition formula is given by\nvAB\n+ vBC\nvAB\nvBC\n\u229e\n= c vAB vcBC .\nc\nc\n1+ c . c\n\n(1)\n\nThe rapidity \u03b1 for a velo ity v is de\u001cned by\n\n(2)\n\n\u03b1\nv\ntanh( ) = ,\nb\nc\n\nwith b an arbitrary nonzero onstant usually hosen to be unity. We \u001cnd that\n\u03b1AB + \u03b1BC = \u03b1AC \u21d4\n\n(3)\n\nvAB\nvBC\nvAC\n\u229e\n=\n.\nc\nc\nc\n\nIn other words, relativisti velo ity addition in one spatial dimension is equivalent to ordinary addition of the orresponding rapidities. In a ompanion paper , we dis uss the use of velo ity fa tors (two-way doppler fa tors) to\nsimplify al ulations.\nVelo ity fa tors\nc+v\nf=\n(4)\nc\u2212v\nand their square roots\nr\nc+v\nk=\n(5)\nc\u2212v\nan be interpreted respe tively as two-way and one-way doppler fa tors. It is natural to seek a physi al interpretation\nfor rapidity as well.\nElegantly, L\u00e9vy-Leblond has interpreted rapidity as the integral of proper a eleration . Beginning at rest in a ertain\nframe, a elerating arbitrarily along a straight line, one's urrent rapidity is always the integral of what an ideal\na elerometer would measure. If one hooses the arbitrary onstant b to be equal to c, the rapidity is the velo ity\nthat an ideal Newtonian inertial guidan e system would impute.\n1\n\n2\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nTHE CHANGE-IN-PITCH INTERPRETATION OF RAPIDITY\n\nBut we an also give another intepretation. From the de\u001cnition of rapidity, we \u001cnd that\nv\n\u03b1 = b arctanh\nc\ns\n1 + v/c\n= b ln\n1 \u2212 v/c\nr\nc+v\n= b ln\nc\u2212v\n= b ln k,\n\n(6)\nq\nwhere k =\nis the one-way doppler fa tor for frequen ies, for a velo ity of approa h v between sour e and\nobserver. Rapidities ompose by addition be ause they are logarithms of doppler fa tors, and doppler fa tors ompose\nby multipli ation.\nUsing generi logarithms lg(.) and taking b = 1 neper = lg e,\n\u03b1 = ln k lg e\nlg k\n=\nlg e\nlg e\n= lg k.\n(7)\nThis a very simple relationship, and says that the rapidity so de\u001cned is just the logarithmi level of k. We an further\nwrite\nc+v\nc\u2212v\n\n3\n\nlg(k)\nlg(2)\nlg(2)\n= log2 (k)\n= 12 log2 (k)\n\n\u03b1 =\n\no taves\nsemitones,\n(8)\nfor k the doppler fa tor of frequen y shift along the line of motion. Human pit h per eption is logarithmi in frequen y.\nIf we had the ability to hear ele tromagneti radiation, the rapidity \u03b1 is simply the doppler-indu ed shift in pit h.\nThe pit h of radiation from the dire tion boosted toward goes sharp by \u03b1, while the pit h from the opposite dire tion\ngoes \u001dat by \u03b1.\nIII.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe following are all equivalent one-dimensional kinemati states :\n\u2022 light from dire tly ahead is sharp\u0016blueshifted\u0016by one semitone,\n\u2022 light from dire tly behind is \u001dat\u0016redshifted\u0016by one semitone,\n\u2022 proper a eleration integrated with respe t to proper time imputes a Newtonian velo ity of c ln 2\n0.057762 c, but\n\u2022 the relativisti ally orre t velo ity is\n(21/12 )2 \u2212 1\nc \u2248 0.057698\n(21/12 )2 + 1\n\n1/12\n\n\u2248\n\n(9)\n\n\f3\nAt nearly 6% of c, the rapidity is one semitone, while the relativisti ally orre t velo ity di\u001bers from the Newtonian\nal ulated velo ity by about one part in a thousand. For many purposes, then, below this speed one an treat the\nrapidity and velo ity as proportional, and even identify them. On the other hand, the semitone is still a large rapidity\nompared to those usual for ma ros opi terrestrial obje ts. Taking the \u001cne stru ture onstant as 1/137 and the mass\nof ele tron to be negligible ompared to that of the proton, then the velo ity of an orbital ele tron in a hydrogeni\natom is c/137. This velo ity orresponds to a rapidity of about an eighth of a semitone. The ent, a pit h unit used\nin piano tuning and de\u001cned as one per ent of a semitone, orresponds to a velo ity of\n2\n\u22121\nc \u2248 ln 2 * c/1200 \u2248 173 km/s,\n(10)\n2\n+1\n2/1200\n2/1200\n\nstill a very large velo ity for ma ros opi terrestrial obje ts. For omparison, the orbital velo ity of the sun about the\ngala ti enter is about 217 km/s, es ape velo ity at the surfa e of the sun is about 618 km/s, and es ape velo ity\nfrom Jupiter's surfa e is about 60 km/s.\nA rapidity of one millionth of a semitone orresponds to a speed of about 17.32 m/s, whi h is just over 60 km/h,\nor just under 40 miles/hour. Highway patrol radar guns need to resolve frequen y di\u001beren es to at least an order of\nmagnitude smaller, or a ten millionth of a semitone.\nOne nanosemitone orresponds to about 1.732 m/s. Still, these quantities di\u001ber in mu h the way that a small angle\ndi\u001bers from its tangent. Rapidities add in a relavisti ally orre t fashion, while velo ities do not, ex ept approximately.\nIf human vision had su h extreme frequen y resolution that we ould see doppler e\u001be ts at familiar speeds, or if we\nould somehow hear light to su h resolution, perhaps an intuitive understanding of relativity would be mu h easier\nto develop.\n1\nA.
