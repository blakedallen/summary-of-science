In probabilistic terms, this corresponds to a specific form of correlation of N equally probable binary variables which satisfy scaleinvariance. Indeed, the marginal probabilities of the N -system precisely coincide with the joint\n1\u2212\n\nR\u221e\n\n[p(x)]q\n\n\u2212\u221e\nprobabilities of the (N \u2212 1)-system. On the other hand, the nonadditive entropy Sq \u2261\nq\u22121\nR\u221e\n(q \u2208 R; S1 = \u2212 \u2212\u221e p(x) ln p(x)), which grounds nonextensive statistical mechanics, is, under ap-\n\npropriate constraints, extremized by the (q\u2013Gaussian) distribution pq (x) \u221d [1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 q) \u03b2 x2 ]1/(1\u2212q)\n2\n\n(q < 3; p1 (x) \u221d e\u2212\u03b2x ). These distributions also result, as attractors, from a generalized central\nlimit theorem for random variables which have a finite generalized variance, and are correlated in\na specific way called q\u2013independence. In order to physically enlighten this concept, we introduce\nhere three types of asymptotically scale-invariant probabilistic models with binary random variables, namely (i) a family, characterized by an index \u03bd = 1, 2, 3, . . . , unifying the Leibnitz triangle\n(\u03bd = 1) and the case of independent variables (\u03bd \u2192 \u221e); (ii) two slightly different discretizations of\nq\u2013Gaussians; (iii) a special family, characterized by the parameter \u03c7, which generalizes the usual\ncase of independent variables (recovered for \u03c7 = 1/2). Models (i) and (iii) are in fact strictly\nscale-invariant. For models (i), we analytically show that the N \u2192 \u221e probability distribution is\na q\u2013Gaussian with q = (\u03bd \u2212 2)/(\u03bd \u2212 1). Models (ii) approach q\u2013Gaussians by construction, and\nwe numerically show that they do so with asymptotic scale-invariance. Models (iii), like two other\nstrictly scale-invariant models recently discussed by Hilhorst and Schehr (2007), approach instead\nlimiting distributions which are not q\u2013Gaussians. The scenario which emerges is that asymptotic\n(or even strict) scale-invariance is not sufficient but it might be necessary for having strict (or\nasymptotic) q\u2013independence, which, in turn, mandates q\u2013Gaussian attractors.\nPACS numbers: 05.20.-y, 02.50.-r, 05.70.-a\nKeywords: Central limit theorem, q-Gaussians, Nonextensive statistical mechanics, Nonadditive entropy\n\n2\n\n\fI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe central limit theorem (CLT) provides a most powerful tool to explain the ubiquity\nof Gaussian distributions in physical systems. It explains that N independent or weakly\ncorrelated arbitrarily distributed random variables, with finite variances, sum up to Gaussian probability distributions for N \u2192 \u221e, corresponding to the thermodynamical limit in\nphysical systems. This theorem constitutes part of the foundations of Boltzmann-Gibbs\n(BG) statistical mechanics, making it possible to describe a vast number of systems without\naccounting for the specific micro-dynamics constituting them.\nOn the other hand, in systems dominated by strongly correlated microscopic events,\ncorrelations have remained a stumbling block for the researcher, making it extremely difficult\nto adequately take into account the contribution of all the microscopic events in order to\nget a general macroscopic behavior.\nRecently, specific generalizations of the CLT have been proposed taking into account some\nclasses of global correlations, typically correlations over long distances [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].\nLet us briefly review the present situation. When we have N identical independent random\nvariables whose individual distribution has a finite variance, their sum approaches, as N\ndiverges and after appropriate centering and scaling, a Gaussian distribution. This is the\nso-called standard CLT. If the individual variance diverges (due to fat tails of the power-law\nclass, excepting for possible logarithmic corrections), the attractor is a L\u00e9vy distribution\n(also called sometimes \u03b1-stable distribution). If the variables are not independent but q\u2013\nindependent (the q = 1 particular instance recovers standard probabilistic independence),\nthen, if certain q\u2013generalized variance is finite, the attractor is a q\u2013Gaussian distribution\n[2]; if that variance diverges (due to specific power-law asymptotics), then the attractor is a\n(q, \u03b1)-stable distribution [3]. These various results have been numerically illustrated in [8, 9],\nand some extensions can be seen in [4, 5, 6, 7, 10]. When q = 1, the correlations disappear,\nand the q\u2013Gaussian ((q, \u03b1)-stable distribution) reproduces a Gaussian (L\u00e9vy distribution).\nIn terms of mathematical grounding of statistical mechanics, the q 6= 1 CLT cases play for\nnonextensive statistical mechanics [14, 15, 16, 17] the same role that the q = 1 CLT cases\nplay for the BG theory. The development of this theory is motivated by the observation\nthat q-Gaussians (or distributions very close to them) appear in many real physical systems,\nsuch as cold atoms in dissipative optical lattices [18], dusty plasma [19], motion of Hydra\n3\n\n\fcells [20], and defect turbulence [21]. This suggests that this kind of probability distribution\nplays an important role in system out-of equilibrium presenting global correlations.\nA central point of this generalized theorem is of course the hypothesis of q\u2013independence\n(defined in [2] through the q\u2013product [22, 23], and the q\u2013generalized Fourier transform [2]).\nThis corresponds, when q 6= 1, to a global correlation of the N random variables. Its rigorous\ndefinition is however not transparent enough in physical terms. An important goal along\nthese lines is therefore to describe in simple terms the basic physical assumptions behind\nthe mathematical requirement of q\u2013independence. Two types of simple models have been\nrecently introduced [11, 12] in order to provide this insight. They are hereafter referred to as\nthe MTG and the TMNT models respectively. The first one is a discrete model with binary\nrandom variables; the second one involves continuous variables. They both are strictly scaleinvariant and have been found numerically to converge, when N increases, on distributions\nremarkably close to q\u2013Gaussians. However, a rigorous analytical treatment showed that\nthe functional form of the probability distribution, although being amazingly well fitted by\nq\u2013Gaussians in both models, differs from it in the thermodynamical limit [13]. This fact\nestablished that strict scale-invariance (hence asymptotic-scale invariance) is not sufficient\nfor having q\u2013Gaussians as limiting distributions. It remained open the question whether\nscale-invariance allows for such limiting distributions. In the present paper, we precisely\nclarify this central issue, thus providing some insight into this problem.\nAfter some brief review of the theoretical frame within which q\u2013Gaussians emerge, we\nintroduce, in Sec. III, a strictly scale-invariant family of Leibnitz\u2013like triangles, for which\nthe limiting distribution can be exactly obtained. Its limiting distributions are q\u2013Gaussians,\nwhich proves that scale-invariance is consistent with q\u2013Gaussianity. In Sec. IV we discretize (in two slightly different manners) q\u2013Gaussians. We then show numerically that\nthese discretized distributions approach the limiting ones -q\u2013Gaussians by construction-\nwith asymptotic scale-invariance. This illustrates that both strict and asymptotic scaleinvariances are compatible with q\u2013Gaussianity. Finally, in Sec. V we introduce another\nfamily of strictly scale-invariant probabilistic triangles which, like the MTG and TMNT\nmodels, do not converge onto q\u2013Gaussians, but onto rather curious distributions, having a\nsingular behavior at infinity. We conclude in Sec. VI.\n\n4\n\n\fII.\n\nq\u2013GAUSSIANS\n\nIn addition to their appearance in a q\u2013generalized CLT, q\u2013Gaussians are the nonextensive\nstatistical mechanical [14, 15, 16, 17] analog to Gaussians in the BG theory. By introducing\na generalized entropic functional, a generalized thermostatistics could be developed that\nexhibits a thermodynamic scenario similar to that of the original one. This theory accounts\nfor a class of systems where the BG theory fails. The entropy Sq (with q 6= 1) was proposed\nas an alternative to the BG entropy for complex systems, e.g., trapped in nonergodic non\u2013\nequilibrium states [26, 27], or nonlinear dynamical systems at the edge of chaos [28, 29]. Also,\na connection between this generalized entropy and the generalized nonlinear Fokker-Planck\nequation leading to anomalous diffusion has been established [30].\nR\u221e\n2\n2\nIndeed, p1 (x) \u221d e\u2212x /2\u03c3 optimizes the BG entropy S1 = \u2212k \u2212\u221e p1 (x) ln p1 (x) dx, under\nR\u221e\nR\u221e\nconstraints \u2212\u221e dx p1 (x) = 1 and hx2 i1 \u2261 \u2212\u221e dx x2 p1 (x) = \u03c3 2 . Analogously, q\u2013Gaussians\noptimize the entropy\n\n\u0002\n\u0003 1\npq (x) \u221d 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 q)\u03b2x2 1\u2212q\n\nSq [pq (x)] = k\nunder constraints\n\nR\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n1\u2212\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n(q < 3)\n\n(1)\n\ndx [pq (x)]q\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nq\u22121\n\ndx pq (x) = 1 and [31]\nZ \u221e\ndx x2 [pq (x)]q\n= \u03c32\nhx2 iq \u2261 Z\u2212\u221e\u221e\ndx [pq (x)]q\n\u2212\u221e\n\np\nIt must be noted that q\u2013Gaussians (1) have compact support (|x| 6 1/ (1 \u2212 q)\u03b2) for q < 1\n\nand are defined for all x for q > 1. In addition, the second moment of q\u2013Gaussians remains\n\nfinite for q < 5/3. In the following, we will consider \u03b2 = 1. The distribution Pq (x) \u2261\nR\u221e\n[pq (x)]q / \u2212\u221e dx [pq (x)]q is called escort distribution [24] and its relevance is discussed, for\n\ninstance, in [25]. Sq is nonadditive for q 6= 1 since, for two independent systems A and B,\nwe easily verify (assuming k = 1) Sq (A + B) = Sq (A) + Sq (B) + (1 \u2212 q)Sq (A)Sq (B).\nIn complex cases, the BG entropy generally looses its extensivity, i.e., it no more (asymptotically) increases linearly with the system size. In this paper, the emphasis is to consider\nq\u2013Gaussians as being limiting probability functions characteristic for non-equilibrium states.\n\nWe will determine the characteristic entropic index for the simple systems described in the\n5\n\n\ffollowing sections but do not necessarily expect them to yield extensivity of the q\u2013entropy\nwith the same value for q that they exhibit in the stationary state distribution.\n\nIII.\n\nFIRST MODEL: A FAMILY OF LEIBNITZ-LIKE TRIANGLES\n\nIn a probabilistic context, scale invariance will be said to (strictly) occur when, for a set\nof N random variables, the functional form of the associated marginal probabilities of the\nN-variables set coincides with the joint probabilities associated with the (N \u2212 1)-variables\nset, i.e, when\nZ\n\npN (x1 , x2 , . . . , xN \u22121 , xN ) dxN = pN \u22121 (x1 , x2 , . . . , xN \u22121 ) .\n\n(2)\n\nThis relation is always valid for independent random variables, where the joint probability\ncorresponds to the product of the individual probabilities, but it is by no means necessarily\nvalid for correlated ones (see, for instance, Sec. IV for a counter example).\nWe take now the case of a set of binary independent variables, each one taking values 1 or\n0 with probabilities p and 1 \u2212 p respectively.

For the\nN = 3 case, it is necessary to project a cube in the plane in order to represent the whole set\nof probabilities (Table II).\nEach box of Table II contains two probabilities. The one in brackets stands for the case\nx3 = 0, the other being for x3 = 1. Adding up the two probabilities of each box of Table II\nwe get the corresponding box of Table I, so scale invariance, eq.

The above triangle reflects\nthe aforementioned scale invariance, eq.(2), in the sense that its coefficients satisfy the\nrelation\nrN,n + rN,n+1 = rN \u22121,n\n\n(3)\n\nthat is, the sum of two consecutive coefficients (marginal probabilities of a N\u2013system) in the\nsame row yields the coefficient on top of them (joint probabilities of the (N \u2212 1)\u2013system).\nIn other words, the corresponding marginal probabilities happen to coincide with the row\njust above, a quite remarkable property (by no means general: see Sec. IV). More precisely,\nwe are comparing two systems: one with N elements and one with (N \u2212 1) elements. And\neq. (3) means that the probabilistic observation of the (N \u2212 1)-system coincides with the\nobservation of (N \u2212 1) particles of the N-system. Relation (3) can alternatively be given as\n\na rule to generate the triangle together with the starting condition rN,0 = pN for each row.\n\nLet us focus now on the random variable z = x1 + x2 + * * * + xN .

It can be easily\nverified that pN,n is the binomial distribution which has, as limiting probability function\n(N \u2192 \u221e), a Gaussian.\nScale invariance condition (3) is the so called Leibnitz triangle rule.

Let us emphasize that this definition leads\nP\nto i) positive, ii) symmetric, and iii) norm preserving (in the sense that N\nn=0 pN,n = 1, for\nall values of N) triangles.

In order to verify\nif the concept of q-independence, i.e. correlations leading to q-Gaussians, can be related to\nscale invariance in probabilistic terms, relation (3) is expected to be satisfied at least in the\nlimit N \u2192 \u221e, i.e., asymptotically.\nConsidering again the set of N equally probable binary variables, the correlations will\nnow be given in the form\npq (xN,n )\nrN,n = \u0012 \u0013 N\nN X\npq (xN,n )\nn n=0\n\n(19)\n\nwhere xN,n are N + 1 equally spaced points in the support of the q\u2013Gaussian pq (x), to be\n\u0001\nspecified later. For the set of probabilities we again write pN,n = Nn rN,n , which provides\n\nus with a discrete probability distribution which, by construction, follows the shape of the\nq\u2013Gaussian pq (x).\nConcerning the way to choose the points xN,n in (19) a distinction must be made between\ncases q < 1 and q > 1.\nAs mentioned before, for q < 1, q\u2013Gaussians have compact and symmetric support of\np\nwidth \u2206 \u2261 2/ (1 \u2212 q). For this case, we will consider two different ways to choose the\n\npoints xN,n in the support of the q\u2013Gaussian:\n1) N + 2 discretization (D1):\n\nIn this implementation, we take xN,n = xmin + (n + 1)h,\n\nfor n = 0, 1, . . . , N, with xmin = \u2212\u2206/2 and h = \u2206/(N + 2), i.e., explicitly, xN,n = xmin +\nh, xmin + 2h, xmin + 3h, ..., xmin + (N + 1)h.\n2) N + 1 discretization (D2):\n\nNow, the points xN,n are chosen differently: the same\n\ninitial interval \u2206 breaks now into N + 1 equal subintervals (not N + 2 as before) of width\nh = \u2206/(N + 1) and we take the values of pq (xN,n ) in the center of each subinterval, i.e.\nxN,n = xmin + (2n + 1)h/2. The whole set reads xN,n = xmin + h/2, xmin + 3h/2, xmin +\n5h/2, ..., xmin + (2N + 1)h/2.\nIn contrast, for q > 1, the support for q\u2013Gaussians is the whole real axis and we must\ntake this into account in the fit. We will take an increasing width for the fit interval in the\nform \u2206N = \u03b4(N + 1)\u03b3 , \u03b4 being some initial width, and \u03b3, with 0 6 \u03b3 6 1, a parameter\n13\n\n\fdetermining the growth of the interval width (for \u03b3 = 0 we recover the q < 1 case). Now\nxN,n = xmin,N + (n + 1)hN , with xmin,N = \u2212\u2206N /2 and hN = \u2206N /(N + 2).\nDespite the fact that different discretizations yield different triangles (19) for a given\nvalue of q, let us emphasize that the corresponding limiting distributions pN,n tend to the\nsame q\u2212Gaussian pq (x) in the limit N \u2192 \u221e.\nNow the following question arises. Do the triangles (19) satisfy relation (3) as the triangles\n(5) from Sec. III do? In other words, can q\u2013Gaussians be related to strictly scale-invariant\ndistributions? Strictly speaking, they are not, since relation (3) is not exactly fulfilled (except\nfor the case q = 0 with the first discretization D1, as we will show later), but we will show\n(analytically in some cases, numerically in others) that these triangles are asymptotically\nscale-invariant, that is, relation (3) is satisfied for N \u2192 \u221e, or, alternatively, the ratio\nQN,n \u2261\n\nrN,n\nrN +1,n + rN +1,n+1\n\n(20)\n\ntends to 1 (or equivalently QN,n \u2212 1 tends to 0) as N increases. Note that Q0,0 = Q1,0 =\nQ1,1 = 1 for arbitrary values of r0,0 , r1,n and r2,n .\n\nA.\n\nThe q < 1 case\n\nFigure 3 shows QN,n \u2212 1 as a function of n for N = 500 and different values of q, for both\nthe D1 and D2\u2013discretizations. It is clearly observed the proximity of QN,n to 1, which is\nmore noticeable in the center of the triangle.\nQuite remarkably, for q = 0, strict scale invariance is obtained in the first discretization,\nthat is, QN,n = 1 for all N and n. This is so because, in this case, it can be proved that\ntriangle (19) exactly coincides with the Leibnitz-like triangle of the family (5) with \u03bd = 2,\n\u0001 (2)\n(2)\nwith associated probabilities pN,n = Nn rN,n = 6[1 + n(N \u2212 n)/(N + 1)]/(N + 2)(N + 3).\nAn exact expression for rN,n and hence QN,n can also be obtained for the D2 discretization\n\nand q = 0, the probabilities being in this case pN,n = 3[(2n+1)(2N \u22122n+1)]/[(N +1)(2N 2 +\n4N + 3)]. Of particular interest are the central value, Qc \u2261 QN,N/2 , and the boundary one,\nQ0 \u2261 QN,0 , of quotient (20), being given by\n(N + 2)2 N(2N 2 + 8N + 9)\n(2N 2 + 4N + 3)(N 3 + 6N 2 + 10N + 2)\n(2N + 1)(N + 2)(2N 2 + 8N + 9)\nQ0 =\n.\n(2N 2 + 4N + 3)(2N 2 + 11N + 6)\nQc =\n\n14\n\nfor odd N,\n\n(21)\n(22)\n\n\f1e-05\n\nq=1/2\n\nQN,n-1\n\nq=0\n0\n\nq=-1\n-1e-05\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n0\nxN,n\n\n0\n\nQN,n-1\n\nq=1/2\n\nq=-1\n\n-0.0001\n\n-1\n\n0\nxN,n\n\n1\n\nFIG. 3: QN,n \u2212 1 as a function of xN,n for N = 500 and different values of q = \u22121, \u22121/2, 0, 1/4, 1/2\nfor discretizations D1 (top) and D2 (bottom). Strict scale invariance is observed for q = 0 and\ndiscretization D1. In the rest of the cases deviation from zero is small and, as can be seen by\nresults not shown here, decreases when increasing N .\n\n15\n\n\fFrom Eqs. (21) and (22) results Qc \u2212 1 \u223c N \u22122 and Q0 \u2212 1 \u223c \u2212N \u22121 , respectively. Though\nthis equations are only valid for q = 0, this trend is observed for any value of q < 1.\nFigure 4 shows in a log-log plot Qc \u2212 1 as a function of N for different values of q < 1 and\n\nboth discretizations. It is clear that the decay follows a 1/N 2 power-law for large N and\nany value of q. No substantial differences are observed between both discretizations.\nAnalogously, Fig. 5 shows Q0 \u2212 1 as a function of N and different values of q. We observe\n\nnow a 1/N power-law. We found that this 1/N power-law transforms into the 1/N 2 when\n\nwe do not take into account the complete interval of the compact support of the q\u2013Gaussian\nunder consideration (not shown).\nConcerning the extensivity of Sq , the same behavior as in the previous systems is found.\nWe get qent = 1 no matter the value of q 6 1 of the discretized q\u2013Gaussian (let us remind that\nthere is no reason for the value of q of the discretized q\u2212Gaussian be equal, or even simply\nrelated, to the index qent corresponding to the extensivity of the entropy Sq (N)), and no\nmatter the type of discretization (D1 or D2). Figure 6 shows the q\u2212entropy for discretized\nq\u2013Gaussians for typical values of q. The results are independent of the discretization.\n\nB.\n\nThe q > 1 case\n\nA similar trend is observed for q > 1. Quotients Q0 and Qc tend to 1 as N increases\nfor all values of \u03b3, which, as mentioned before, determines the growth of the interval where\nthe q\u2212Gaussian is evaluated. In the case of the Gaussian, i.e. q = 1, it is known that\n\u03b3 = 1/2. Figure 7 shows the decay of the central quotient for q = 3/2 and different values\nof \u03b3. Apparently, \u03b3 = 1/2 provides the appropriate growth of the interval for q\u2013Gaussians\nwith q > 1 as well. For \u03b3 < 1/2, one observes the power-law behavior only over some range\nwhereas for \u03b3 > 1/2 the decay follows a power-law with an exponent larger than \u22121. The\nboundary ratio displays the same dependence on \u03b3.\nFor \u03b3 = 1/2 we verify a 1/N power-law. Figure 8 shows Qc \u2212 1 and Q0 \u2212 1 for typical\nvalues of q and \u03b3 = 1/2.\nIn what concerns the extensivity of the entropy Sq , the value of qent remains 1 and is\nindependent of \u03b3.

These systems correspond to N correlated binary random variables, the\nindex q characterizing the strength of correlation. The case q \u2192 \u2212\u221e corresponds to very\nstrongly correlated variables giving a uniform limiting distribution.\nOn the other hand, the coefficients of another type of triangles were constructed by\ndiscretizing q\u2013Gaussians. These triangles, having now by construction q\u2013Gaussians with\nq < 1 as limiting probability functions, showed a behavior with depends on the specific\ndiscretization of the support interval. Except for one particular case, the Leibnitz rule,\nrelated to system size scale invariance of the probabilities, is only asymptotically satisfied.\n22\n\n\fThe system approaches scale invariance with a 1/N 2 power-law for large N, except for\nthe boundary coefficients where the convergence to scale invariance is much slower, of the\ntype 1/N. The 1/N 2 law makes a crossover into a 1/N one over the entire triangle when\nconsidering q\u2013Gaussians with q > 1.\nFinally, another family of strictly scale-invariant triangles with a rather strange limiting\ndistribution function was introduced. In the limit N \u2192 \u221e, the triangles yield a Gaussian\ndistribution together with two delta peaks centered at points going to infinity.\nThe BG\u2013entropy remains extensive for all three types of triangles, equally to previously\nstudied Leibnitz\u2013like triangles [11]. This may be the result of the simplicity of the models\npresented in this paper. More sophisticated models, as for instance the Hamiltonian mean\nfield model (see for instance ref. [26, 27]), appear to approach a q\u2013Gaussian characterized\nby a non-equilibrium stationary state with the q\u2013entropy possibly being extensive for q 6= 1.\nHowever, in the present effort we are here not particularly interested in the general relation\nbetween the extensivity of the entropy and stationary-state probability distributions, but\nwe rather searched to find out which kind of correlation between the microscopic events of\na system leads to q\u2013Gaussians as limiting distributions (possibly, as attractors).\nThe Leibnitz rule provides a simple tool to study models composed of correlated binary\nrandom variables, and enabled the exact calculation of their limiting functions. As already\naddressed in [13], this rule cannot be uniquely related to nonextensive thermostatistics.\nIndeed, Leibnitz-like triangles exist which precisely lead to q\u2013Gaussians (as shown in the\npresent paper) as well as to other limiting probability functions (as shown in [13], and also\nhere). Additionally, the present second family of triangles (with asymptotic but not strict\nscale invariance) also tended to a q\u2013Gaussian. The scenario which emerges is that asymptotic\nvalidity of the Leibnitz rule might represent a necessary but surely not sufficient condition\nfor the system to tend to q\u2013Gaussians as limiting distributions when N \u2192 \u221e.\nThe fact that different implementations of correlations between the variables of a system\ncan lead to the same function, - q\u2013Gaussians in the present case -, can be seen as a hint\nfor these functions being attractors for a variety of different systems, and so supports the\ndemand of generality of the q-generalized central limit theorem presented in [1, 2, 3, 4].\nHowever, to assure the applicability of this central limit theorem, the stability of the q\u2013\nGaussians as limiting functions of the systems presented here needs to be proved, either\nby establishing that the correlations correspond to q-independence, or by introducing, for\n23\n\n\fexample, weak perturbations.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe acknowledge fruitful remarks by H.J.
