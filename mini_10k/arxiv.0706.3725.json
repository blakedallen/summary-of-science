The Lie algebra b\ng\u03ba is the affine Kac\u2013Moody algebra associated to \u03ba. We will denote by b\ng\u03ba -mod the category of discrete representations of b\ng\u03ba (i.e.,\nsuch that any vector is annihilated by g \u2297 tn C[[t]] for sufficiently large n), on which 1\nacts as the identity.\nLet U\u03ba (b\ng) be the quotient of the universal enveloping algebra U (b\ng\u03ba ) of b\ng\u03ba by the\ne\u03ba (b\nideal generated by (1 \u2212 1). Define its completion U\ng) as follows:\ne\u03ba (b\nU\ng) = lim U\u03ba (b\ng)/U\u03ba (b\ng) * (g \u2297 tn C[[t]]).\n\u2190\u2212\n\ne\u03ba (b\nIt is clear that U\ng) is a topological algebra, whose discrete continuous representations\nare the same as objects of b\ng\u03ba -mod.\nLet \u03bacrit be the critical inner product on g defined by the formula\n\n1\n\u03bacrit (x, y) = \u2212 Tr(ad(x) \u25e6 ad(y)).\n2\nIn what follows we will use the subscript \"crit\" instead of \u03bacrit .\nLet \u01e6 be the group of adjoint type whose Lie algebra \u01e7 is Langlands dual to g (i.e.,\nthe Cartan matrix of \u01e7 is the transpose of that of g).\nDate: June 2007.\nThe research of E.F. was supported by the DARPA Program \"Focus Areas in Fundamental\nMathematics\".\n1\n\n\f2\n\nEDWARD FRENKEL AND DENNIS GAITSGORY\n\necrit (b\nLet Zg be the center of U\ng). According to a theorem of [FF, F2], Zg is isomorphic\n\u00d7\nto the algebra Fun Op\u01e7(D ) of functions on the space of \u01e7-opers on the punctured disc\nD\u00d7 = Spec(C((t))) (see [BD1, FG2] and Sect. 2 for the definition of opers).\nIt is interesting to understand how Zg acts on various b\ngcrit -modules. The standard\nmodules are the Verma modules and the Weyl modules. They are obtained by applying\nthe induction functor\nInd : g -mod \u2192 b\ngcrit -mod,\nM 7\u2192 U (b\ngcrit )\n\n\u2297\n\nU (g[[t]]\u22951)\n\nM,\n\nwhere g[[t]] acts on M via the projection g[[t]] \u2192 g and 1 acts as the identity.\nFor \u03bb \u2208 h\u2217 let M\u03bb be the Verma module over g with highest weight \u03bb. The corresponding b\ngcrit -module M\u03bb = Ind(M\u03bb ) is the Verma module of critical level with highest\nweight \u03bb.\nFor a dominant integral weight \u03bb let V\u03bb be the irreducible finite-dimensional gmodule with highest weight \u03bb. The corresponding b\ngcrit-module V\u03bb = Ind(V\u03bb ) is the\nWeyl module of critical level with highest weight \u03bb. The module V0 = Ind(C0 ) is also\ncalled the vacuum module.\nIt was proved in [FF, F2] that the algebra of b\ngcrit -endomorphisms of V0 is isomorphic\nreg\nto the algebra Fun Op\u01e7 of functions on the space Opreg\n\u01e7 of \u01e7-opers on the disc D =\nSpec(C[[t]]).

In addition, there is an analogue of the\nabove commutative diagram for Verma modules.\nIn this paper we consider the Weyl modules V\u03bb . In [FG2], Sect. 2.9, we defined the\nRS,\u031f(\u2212\u03bb\u2212\u03c1)\nof \u03bb-regular opers (we recall this definition below). Its\n\u2282 Op\u01e7\nsubspace Op\u03bb,reg\n\u01e7\nRS,\u031f(\u2212\u03bb\u2212\u03c1)\n\nwhich have trivial monodromy and are therefore\npoints are those opers in Op\u01e7\n\u01e6(K\u0302) gauge equivalent to the trivial local system on D\u00d7 . In particular, Op\u01e70,reg = Opreg\n\u01e7 .\n, where \u03bb runs over the set\nAccording to Lemma 1 below, the disjoint union of Op\u03bb,reg\n\u01e7\nP + of dominant integral weights of g, is precisely the locus of \u01e7-opers on D\u00d7 with trivial\nmonodromy. The main result of this paper is the following theorem, which generalizes\nthe description of Endbgcrit V0 from [FF, F2] to the case of an arbitrary dominant integral\nweight \u03bb.\n\n\fWEYL MODULES AND OPERS WITHOUT MONODROMY\n\n3\n\nTheorem 1.

This statement was also independently\nconjectured by A. Beilinson and V. Drinfeld (unpublished).\n.\nIn addition, we prove that V\u03bb is a free module over Endbgcrit V\u03bb \u2243 Fun Op\u03bb,reg\n\u01e7\nTheorem 1 has important consequences for the local geometric Langlands correspondence proposed in [FG2]. According to our proposal, to each \"local Langlands\nparameter\" \u03c3, which is a \u01e6\u2013local system on the punctured disc D\u00d7 (or equivalently, a\n\u01e6-bundle with a connection on D\u00d7 ), there should correspond a category C\u03c3 equipped\nwith an action of G((t)).\nNow let \u03c7 be a fixed \u01e7-oper on D\u00d7 , which we regard as a character of the center Zg.\nConsider the full subcategory b\ngcrit -mod\u03c7 of the category b\ngcrit -mod whose objects are\nb\ngcrit -modules, on which the Zg acts according to this character. This category carries a\ncanonical action of the ind-group G((t)) via its adjoint action on b\ngcrit . We proposed in\n[FG2] that b\ngcrit -mod\u03c7 should be equivalent to the sought-after category C\u03c3 , where \u03c3 is\nthe \u01e6-local system underlying the oper \u03c7. This entails a far-reaching corollary that the\ncategories b\ngcrit -mod\u03c71 and b\ngcrit -mod\u03c72 for two different opers \u03c71 and \u03c72 are equivalent\nif the underlying local systems of \u03c71 and \u03c72 are isomorphic to each other.\nIn particular, consider the simplest case when \u03c3 is the trivial local system. Then,\nfor some \u03bb \u2208 P + . Theorem 1 implies that\nby Lemma 1, \u03c7 must be a point of Op\u03bb,reg\n\u01e7\nthe quotient V\u03bb (\u03c7) of the Weyl module V\u03bb by the central character corresponding to\n\u03c7 is non-zero. Therefore V\u03bb (\u03c7) is a non-trivial object of b\ngcrit -mod\u03c7 and also of the\nG[[t]]\ncorresponding G[[t]]-equivariant category b\ngcrit -mod\u03c7 . In the case when \u03bb = 0 we\nG[[t]]\nhave proved in [FG1] that this is a unique irreducible object of b\ngcrit -mod\u03c7\nand that\nthis category is in fact equivalent to the category of vector spaces. Therefore we expect\nthe same to be true for all other values of \u03bb. This will be proved in a follow-up paper.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we recall the relevant notions of opers,\nCartan connections and Miura transformation. In Sect. 3 we explain the strategy of\nthe proof of the main result, Theorem 1, and reduce it to two statements, Theorem 2\nand Proposition 1. We then prove Proposition 1 assuming Theorem 2 in Sect. 4.\nOur argument is based on the exactness of the functor of quantum Drinfeld\u2013Sokolov\nreduction, which we derive from [Ar]. In Sect. 5 we compute the characters of the\nand of the semi-infinite cohomology of V\u03bb (they turn\nalgebra of functions on Op\u03bb,reg\n\u01e7\nout to be the same). We then give two different proofs of Theorem 2 in Sect. 6. This\ncompletes the proof of the main result. We also show that the natural map from the\nWeyl module V\u03bb to the corresponding Wakimoto module is injective and that V\u03bb is a\nfree module over its endomorphism algebra.\n\n\f4\n\nEDWARD FRENKEL AND DENNIS GAITSGORY\n\n2. Some results on opers\nIn this section we recall the relevant notions of opers, Cartan connections and Miura\ntransformation, following [BD1, F2, FG2], where we refer the reader for more details.\nLet g be a simple Lie algebra and G the corresponding algebraic group of adjoint\ntype. Let B be its Borel subgroup and N = [B, B] its unipotent radical, with the\ncorresponding Lie algebras n \u2282 b \u2282 g.\nLet X be a smooth curve, or the disc D = Spec(\u00d4), where \u00d4 is a one-dimensional\nsmooth complete local ring, or the punctured disc D\u00d7 = Spec(K\u0302), where K\u0302 is the field\nof fractions of \u00d4.\nFollowing Beilinson and Drinfeld (see [BD1], Sect. 3.1, and [BD2]), one defines a\ng-oper on X to be a triple (FG , \u2207, FB ), where FG is a principal G-bundle FG on X,\n\u2207 is a connection on FG , and FB is a B-reduction of FG which is transversal to \u2207, in\nthe sense explained in the above references and in [FG2], Sect. 1.1. We note that the\ntransversality condition allows us to identify canonically the B-bundles FB underlying\nall opers.\nMore concretely, opers on the punctured disc D\u00d7 may be described as follows. Let\nus choose a trivialization of FB and a coordinate t on the disc D such that \u00d4 = C[[t]]\nand K\u0302 = C((t)). Let us choose a nilpotent subalgebra n\u2212 , which is in generic position\nwith b and a set of simple root generators f\u0131 , \u0131 \u2208 I, of n\u2212 . Then a g-oper on D\u00d7 is, by\ndefinition, an equivalence class of operators of the form\nX\n(2.1)\n\u2207 = \u2202t +\nf\u0131 + v,\nv \u2208 b(K\u0302),\n\u0131\u2208I\n\nwith respect to the action of the group N (K\u0302) by gauge transformations. It is known\nthat this action is free and the resulting set of equivalence classes is in bijection with\nK\u0302\u2295l , where l = rank(g). Opers may be defined in this way over any base, and this\nallows us to define the ind-affine scheme Opg(D\u00d7 ) of g-opers on D\u00d7 (it is isomorphic\nto an inductive limit of affine spaces).\nLet P\u030c + be the set of dominant integral coweights of g. For \u03bb\u030c \u2208 P\u030c + we define a g-oper\nwith \u03bb\u030c-nilpotent singularity as an equivalence class of operators\nX\nv\nv(t) \u2208 b(\u00d4), v \u2208 n,\n(2.2)\n\u2207 = \u2202t +\nth\u03b1\u0131 ,\u03bb\u030ci * f\u0131 + v(t) + ,\nt\n\u0131\u2208I\n\nwith respect to the action of the group N (\u00d4) by gauge transformations (see [FG2],\nSect. 2.9). The corresponding scheme is denoted by Op\u03bb\u030c,nilp\n. According to Theorem\ng\n2.9.1 of [FG2], the natural map Op\u03bb\u030c,nilp\n\u2192 Opg(D\u00d7 ) is injective, and its image is equal\ng\nto the space of g-opers with regular singularity and residue \u031f(\u2212\u03bb\u030c \u2212 \u03c1\u030c) (here \u03c1\u030c is the\nhalf-sum of positive coroots of g and \u031f is the projection h \u2192 Spec Fun(h)W ).\nNow we define the space Op\u03bb\u030c,reg\nof \u03bb\u030c-regular opers as the subscheme of Op\u03bb\u030c,nilp\ng\ng\ncorresponding to those operators (2.2) which satisfy v = 0 (so that \u2207 is regular at\nt = 0). In particular, if \u03bb\u030c = 0, then Op0,reg\nis just the space of regular \u01e7-opers on the\ng\ndisc D. The geometric significance of \u03bb\u030c-opers is explained by the following\n\n\fWEYL MODULES AND OPERS WITHOUT MONODROMY\n\n5\n\nLemma 1. Suppose that a g-oper \u03c7 = (FG , \u2207, FB ) on D\u00d7 is such that the corresponding\nG-local system is trivial (in other words, the corresponding operator (2.1) is in the G(K\u0302)\ngauge equivalence class of \u22070 = \u2202t ). Then \u03c7 \u2208 Op\u03bb\u030c,reg\nfor some \u03bb\u030c \u2208 P\u030c + .\ng\nProof. It is clear from the definition that any oper in Op\u03bb\u030c,reg\nis regular on the disc D\ng\nand is therefore G(K\u0302) gauge equivalent to the trivial connection \u22070 = \u2202t .\nNow suppose that we have an oper \u03c7 = (FG , \u2207, FB ) on D\u00d7 such that the corresponding G-local system is trivial. Then \u2207 is G(K\u0302) gauge equivalent to a regular connection\non D. We have the decomposition G(K\u0302) = G(\u00d4)B(K\u0302). The gauge action of G(\u00d4)\npreserves the space of regular connections (in fact, it acts transitively on it). Therefore\nif an oper connection \u2207 is gauge equivalent to a regular connection under the action\nof G(K\u0302), then its B(K\u0302) gauge equivalence class must contain a regular connection.\nThe oper condition then implies that this gauge class contains a connection operator\nof the form (2.2) with v(0) = 0, for some dominant integral coweight \u03bb\u030c. Therefore\n\u03c7 \u2208 Op\u03bb\u030c,reg\n.\n\u0003\ng\nLet us choose a coordinate t on D. The vector field L0 = \u2212t\u2202t then acts naturally\non Op\u03bb\u030c,reg\nand defines a Z-grading on the algebra of functions on it. In Sect. 5 we will\ng\ncompute the character of the algebra Fun Op\u03bb\u030c,reg\nof functions on Op\u03bb\u030c,reg\nwith respect\ng\ng\nto this grading.\nNext, we introduce the space of H-connections and the Miura transformation.\nLet X be as above. Denote by \u03c9X the C\u00d7 -torsor corresponding to the canonical line\n\u03c1\u030c\nbundle on X.

We denote by ConnH (\u03c9X\n) the affine space of all connections on\n\u03c1\u030c\n\u03c1\u030c\n\u03c1\u030c ordk\n\u03c9X .

It can be described as follows.\n\u03c1\u030c\nIf we choose a coordinate t on D, then we trivialize \u03c9D and hence \u03c9D\n. A point of\n\u03c1\u030c\nConnH (\u03c9D\u00d7 ) is then represented by an operator\n\u2207 = \u2202t + u(t),\n\nu(t) \u2208 h(K\u0302).\n\nWe associate to \u2207 the g-oper which is the N (K\u0302) gauge equivalence class of the operator\nX\n\u2207 = \u2202t +\nf\u0131 + u(t).\n\u0131\u2208I\n\n\f6\n\nEDWARD FRENKEL AND DENNIS GAITSGORY\n\nThe following result is a corollary of Proposition 3.5.4 of [FG2].

Exactness\nIn this section we prove Proposition 1 assuming Theorem 2. The proof will rely on\nsome properties of the semi-infinite cohomology functors.\nLet b\ngcrit -modI,Z be the category of b\ngcrit -modules which are equivariant with respect\nto the Iwahori subgroup I \u2282 G((t)) and equipped with a Z-grading with respect to the\noperator L0 = \u2212t\u2202t which commutes with b\ngcrit in the natural way. Since I = H \u22c9 I 0 ,\n0\nwhere I = [I, I], the first condition means that b\nn+ = Lie(I 0 ) acts locally nilpotently,\nand the constant Cartan subalgebra Lie(H) = h \u2297 1 \u2282 g \u2297 1 \u2282 b\ngcrit acts semi-simply\nwith eigenvalues corresponding to integral weights. The second condition means that\nwe have an action of the extended affine Kac\u2013Moody algebra b\ng\u2032\u03ba = CL0 \u22c9 b\ng\u03ba . The\n\n\fWEYL MODULES AND OPERS WITHOUT MONODROMY\n\n9\n\ncategory b\ngcrit -modI,Z is therefore the product of the blocks of the usual category O\u2212h\u2228\nof modules over the extended affine Kac\u2013Moody algebra at the critical level k = \u2212h\u2228 ,\ncorresponding to the (finite) Weyl group orbits in the set of integral weights.\nLet b\ngcrit -modG[[t]],Z be the category of b\ngcrit -modules which are equivariant with respect to the subgroup G[[t]] and equipped with a Z-grading with respect to the operator\nL0 = \u2212t\u2202t . This is the full subcategory of the category b\ngcrit -modI,Z , whose objects are\nmodules integrable with respect to the constant subalgebra g = g \u2297 1 \u2282 b\ngcrit .\nWe define Z-gradings on the modules M\u03bb and V\u03bb in the standard way, by setting\nthe degrees of the generating vectors to be equal to 0 and using the commutation\nrelations of L0 and b\ngcrit to define the grading on the entire modules. Thus, M\u03bb and\nV\u03bb become objects of the category b\ngcrit -modI,Z , and V\u03bb also an object of the category\nG[[t]],Z\nb\ngcrit -mod\n. Moreover, the homomorphism M\u03bb \u2192 V\u03bb , and therefore the map\nb\nb\nn+\nn\n(M\u03bb )\u03bb \u2192 (V\u03bb )\u03bb+ , preserve these gradings.\nWe will now derive Proposition 1 from Theorem 2 and the following statement.\n\nProposition 2. The functor (3.5) is right exact on the category b\ngcrit -modI,Z and is\nG[[t]],Z\nexact on the category b\ngcrit -mod\n.\nIntroduce a Z-grading operator on the standard complex of semi-infinite cohomology\n(n+ ((t)), n+ [[t]], M \u2297 \u03a80 ), where M = M\u03bb or V\u03bb , by the formula\nH\n\u221e\n+\u2022\n2\n\nL0 \u2212 \u03c1\u030c \u2297 1 + h\u03bb, \u03c1\u030ci.\nHere L0 is the natural grading operator and \u03c1\u030c \u2208 h is such that h\u03b1\u0131 , \u03c1\u030ci = 1 for all\n\u0131 \u2208 I. In the same way as in [FB], Sect. 15.1.8, we check that this Z-grading operator\ncommutes with the differential of the complex and hence induces a Z-grading operator\non the cohomology. Observe that \u03c1\u030c \u2297 1 acts by multiplication by h\u03bb, \u03c1\u030ci on any element\nb\nn\nin (V\u03bb )\u03bb+ . Therefore the map (3.9) preserves Z-gradings.\nb\nn\n\nProof of Proposition 1. Let A \u2208 (V\u03bb )\u03bb+ be an element in the kernel of the map (3.9).\nSince this map preserves Z-gradings, without loss of generality we may, and will, assume\nthat A is homogeneous. Under the identification\nb\nn\n\n(V\u03bb )\u03bb+ \u2243 Endbgcrit V\u03bb\nit gives rise to a homogeneous b\ngcrit -endomorphism E of V\u03bb . Then the induced map\n\u221e\nH(E) on H 2 (n+ ((t)), n+ [[t]], V\u03bb \u2297 \u03a80 ) is identically zero. Indeed, the image of the\nb\nn\ngenerating vector of (V\u03bb )\u03bb+ under the map (3.9) is identified with the element\n1 \u2208 z\u03bb,reg \u2243 H\n\n\u221e\n2\n\n(n+ ((t)), n+ [[t]], V\u03bb \u2297 \u03a80 ),\n\nwhere we use the isomorphism of Theorem 2. Therefore the image of this element\n\u221e\n1 of H 2 (n+ ((t)), n+ [[t]], V\u03bb \u2297 \u03a80 ) under H(E) is equal to the image of A in\n\u221e\n\u221e\nH 2 (n+ ((t)), n+ [[t]], V\u03bb \u2297 \u03a80 ), which is 0. By Theorem 2, H 2 (n+ ((t)), n+ [[t]], V\u03bb \u2297 \u03a80 )\nis a free z\u03bb,reg -module generated by the element 1. Therefore we find that H(E) \u2261 0.\nNow let M and N be the kernel and cokernel of E,\nE\n\n0 \u2192 M \u2192 V\u03bb \u2212\u2192 V\u03bb \u2192 N \u2192 0.\n\n\f10\n\nEDWARD FRENKEL AND DENNIS GAITSGORY\n\nNote that both M and N , as well as V\u03bb , are objects of the category b\ngcrit -modG[[t]],Z .\nBy Proposition 2, the functor of semi-infinite cohomology is exact on this category.\nTherefore we obtain an exact sequence\n0\u2192H\n\n\u221e\n2\n\n(n+ ((t)), n+ [[t]], M \u2297 \u03a80 ) \u2192 H\nH\n\n\u221e\n2\n\n\u221e\n2\n\nH(E)\n\n(n+ ((t)), n+ [[t]], V\u03bb \u2297 \u03a80 ) \u2212\u2192\n\n(n+ ((t)), n+ [[t]], V\u03bb \u2297 \u03a80 ) \u2192 H\n\n\u221e\n2\n\n(n+ ((t)), n+ [[t]], N \u2297 \u03a80 ) \u2192 0,\n\nwhere the middle map H(E) is equal to zero. If A 6= 0, then M is a proper submodule\nof V\u03bb which does not contain the generating vector of V\u03bb . We obtain that the values of\nthe Z-grading on M are strictly greater than those on V\u03bb . Therefore the above sequence\ncannot be exact. Hence A = 0 and we obtain the assertion of the proposition.\n\u0003\nIn the rest of this section we prove Proposition 2.

We will give two proofs: one relies on the results of\n[FG3], and the other uses the Wakimoto modules. Both proofs use the computation of\n\u221e\nthe characters of z\u03bb,reg and H 2 +\u2022 (n+ ((t)), n+ [[t]], V\u03bb \u2297 \u03a80 ) which is performed in the\nnext section.\n5. Computation of characters\n5.1. Character of z\u03bb,reg . Let us compute the character of the algebra\nz\u03bb,reg = Fun Op\u03bb,reg\n\u01e7\nwith respect to the Z-grading by the operator L0 . This space\nof functions on Op\u03bb,reg\n\u01e7\nwas defined in Sect. 2, but note that we now switch to the Langlands dual Lie algebra\n\u01e7.\nWe give another, more convenient, realization of the space Op\u03bb,reg\n.

Equivalently, this is the space of (\u03bb + \u03c1)(t)\u0147 (\u00d4)(\u03bb + \u03c1)(t)\u22121 -equivalence classes\nof operators (5.2). It follows from Theorem 2.21 of [FG2] that the action of the group\n(\u03bb + \u03c1)(t)\u0147 (\u00d4)(\u03bb + \u03c1)(t)\u22121 on this space is free. Therefore the character of Fun Op\u03bb,reg\n\u01e7\nis equal to the the character of the algebra of functions on the space of operators (5.2)\ndivided by the character of the algebra Fun((\u03bb + \u03c1)(t)\u0147 (\u00d4)(\u03bb +L\n\u03c1)(t)\u22121 ).\nBy definition, a character of a Z+ -graded vector space V = n\u2208Z+ Vn , where each\nVn is finite-dimensional, is the formal power series\nX\nch V =\ndim Vn * q n .\nn\u22650\n\nApplying the dilation t 7\u2192 at to (5.2), we obtain the action v(t) 7\u2192 av(at). Therefore\nthe character of the algebra of functions on the space of operators (5.2) is equal to\nY\nY Y\n(1 \u2212 q n+h\u03b1\u030c,\u03bb+\u03c1i )\u22121 .\n(1 \u2212 q n )\u2212l *\nn>0\n\n\u02c7 + n>0\n\u03b1\u030c\u2208\u2206\n\n\fWEYL MODULES AND OPERS WITHOUT MONODROMY\n\n13\n\nOn the other hand, the character of Fun((\u03bb + \u03c1)(t)\u0147 (\u00d4)(\u03bb + \u03c1)(t)\u22121 ) is equal to\nY Y\n(1 \u2212 q n+h\u03b1\u030c,\u03bb+\u03c1i )\u22121 .\n\u02c7 + n\u22650\n\u03b1\u030c\u2208\u2206\n\nis equal to\nTherefore the character of z\u03bb,reg = Fun Op\u03bb,reg\n\u01e7\nY\nY\n(1 \u2212 q h\u03b1,\u03bb+\u03c1i ).\n(1 \u2212 q n )\u2212l *\n\u02c7+\n\u03b1\u030c\u2208\u2206\n\nn>0\n\nWe rewrite this in the form\nl\nY\nY 1 \u2212 q h\u03b1\u030c,\u03bb+\u03c1i Y\n(1 \u2212 q ni )\u22121 ,\n(5.3)\nch z\u03bb,reg =\nh\u03b1\u030c,\u03c1i\n1\n\u2212\nq\n\u02c7\ni=1 n \u2265d +1\n\u03b1\u030c\u2208\u2206+\n\ni\n\ni\n\nusing the identify\nY\n\n(1 \u2212 q\n\nh\u03b1\u030c,\u03c1i\n\n\u02c7+\n\u03b1\u030c\u2208\u2206\n\nwhere d1 , . . . , dl are the exponents of g.\n\n)=\n\ndi\nl Y\nY\n\n(1 \u2212 q mi ),\n\ni=1 mi =1\n\n5.2. Computation of semi-infinite cohomology. Let us now compute the semiinfinite cohomology of V\u03bb . The complex C \u2022 (V\u03bb ) computing this cohomology is described in [FB], Ch. 15. In particular, as explained in Sect. 4, it carries a Z-grading\noperator which commutes with the differential and hence gives rise to a grading operator on the cohomology. We will compute the character with respect to this grading\noperator.\nTheorem 4. We have\nch H\n\n\u221e\n2\n\n(n+ ((t)), n+ [[t]], V\u03bb \u2297 \u03a80 ) = ch z\u03bb,reg\n\ngiven by formula (5.3), and\nH\n\n\u221e\n+i\n2\n\n(n+ ((t)), n+ [[t]], V\u03bb \u2297 \u03a80 ) = 0,\n\ni 6= 0.\n\nProof. The vanishing the ith cohomology for i 6= 0 follows from Proposition 2. We will\ngive an alternative proof of this, as well as the computation of the character of the 0th\ncohomology, using the argument of [FB], Sect. 15.2.\nConsider the complex C \u2022 (V\u03bb ) computing our semi-infinite cohomology. This complex\nwas studied in detail in [FB], Sect. 15.2, in the case when \u03bb = 0. We decompose C \u2022 (V\u03bb )\ninto the tensor product of two subcomplexes as in [FB], Sect. 15.2.1,\nC \u2022 (V\u03bb ) = C \u2022 (V\u03bb )0 \u2297 C \u2022 (V\u03bb )\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2022\n\u2022\ndefined in the same way as the subcomplexes C\u2212h\n\u2228 (g)0 and C\u2212h\u2228 (g) , respectively. In\n\u2022\n\u2022\nfact, C (V\u03bb )0 is equal to C\u2212h\u2228 (g)0 , and\n^\n\u2022\nC \u2022 (V\u03bb )\u2032 \u2243 V\u03bb \u2297 U (t\u22121 b\u2212 [t\u22121 ]) \u2297\n(n+ [[t]]\u2217 ).\n\nIn particular, its cohomological grading takes only non-negative values on C \u2022 (V\u03bb )\u2032 .\nWe show, in the same way as in [FB], Lemma 15.2.5, that the cohomology of C \u2022 (V\u03bb )\nis isomorphic to the tensor product of the cohomologies of the subcomplexes C \u2022 (V\u03bb )0\n\n\f14\n\nEDWARD FRENKEL AND DENNIS GAITSGORY\n\nand C \u2022 (V\u03bb )\u2032 . The former is one-dimensional, according to [FB], Lemma 15.2.7, and\nhence we find that our semi-infinite cohomology is isomorphic to the cohomology of the\nsubcomplex C \u2022 (V\u03bb )\u2032 .\nFollowing verbatim the computation in [FB], Sect. 15.2.9, in the case when \u03bb = 0,\nwe find that the 0th cohomology of C \u2022 (V\u03bb )\u2032 is isomorphic to\nH\n\n\u221e\n2\n\n(n+ ((t)), n+ [[t]], V\u03bb \u2297 \u03a80 ) \u2243 V\u03bb \u2297 V (a\u2212 )\n\n(where V (a\u2212 ) is defined in [FB], Sect. 15.2.9), and all other cohomologies vanish.\n\u221e\nIn particular, we find that the character of H 2 (n+ ((t)), n+ [[t]], V\u03bb \u2297 \u03a80 ) is equal to\nch V\u03bb * ch V (a\u2212 ),\nwhere ch V\u03bb is the character of V\u03bb with respect to the principal grading. By [FB], Sect.\n15.2.9, we have\nl\nY\nY\nch V (a\u2212 ) =\n(1 \u2212 q mi )\u22121 .\ni=1 mi \u2265di +1\n\nAccording to formula (10.9.4) of [Kac], ch V\u03bb is equal to\n(5.4)\n\nch V\u03bb =\n\nY 1 \u2212 q h\u03b1\u030c,\u03bb+\u03c1i\n.\n1 \u2212 q h\u03b1\u030c,\u03c1i\n\u02c7\n\n\u03b1\u030c\u2208\u2206+\n\nTherefore the character\nch H\n\n\u221e\n2\n\n(n+ ((t)), n+ [[t]], V\u03bb \u2297 \u03a80 )\n\nis given by formula (5.3), which coincides with the character of z\u03bb,reg .\n\n\u0003\n\n6. Proof of Theorem 2\n6.1. First proof. The following result is proved in [FG3], Lemma 1.7.\nProposition 3. The action of the center Zg on V\u03bb factors through z\u03bb,reg .\n= Spec zreg,\u03bb in the center Zg = Fun(Op\u01e7(D\u00d7 )). As\nLet I\u03bb be the ideal of Opreg,\u03bb\n\u01e7\nexplained in [FG2], Sect. 4.6 (see [BD1], Sect. 3.6, in the case when \u03bb = 0), the\nPoisson structure on Zg gives rise to the structure of a Lie algebroid on the quotient\n. Recall from [FF, F2] that the Poisson\nI\u03bb /(I\u03bb )2 , which we denote by N \u2217 \u03bb,reg\n\u00d7\nOp\u01e7\n\n/ Op\u01e7 (D )\n\nstructure on Zg is obtained by deforming the completed enveloping algebra of b\ng to\nnon-critical levels. By Proposition 3, I\u03bb annihilates the module V\u03bb . Since this module\nmay be deformed to the Weyl modules at non-critical levels, we obtain that the Lie\nnaturally acts on V\u03bb (see [BD1], Sect. 5.6, in the case when\nalgebroid N \u2217 \u03bb,reg\n\u00d7\nOp\u01e7\n\n/ Op\u01e7 (D )\n\n\u03bb = 0) and on its semi-infinite cohomology. This action is compatible with the action\nof Fun(Op\u01e7(D\u00d7 ))/I\u03bb = zreg,\u03bb .\nUsing the commutative diagram (3.3) and Proposition 3, we obtain that the composition (3.7) factors through a map\nz\u03bb,reg \u2192 H\n\n\u221e\n2\n\n(n+ ((t)), n+ [[t]], V\u03bb \u2297 \u03a80 ).\n\n\fWEYL MODULES AND OPERS WITHOUT MONODROMY\n\n15\n\nBy applying the same argument as in the proof of Proposition 18.3.2 of [FG2], we\nobtain that the above map is a homomorphism of modules over the Lie algebroid\n. This homomorphism is clearly non-zero, because we can identify the\nN \u2217 \u03bb,reg\n\u00d7\nOp\u01e7\n\n/ Op\u01e7 (D )\n\nimage of the generator 1 \u2208 z\u03bb,reg with the cohomology class represented by the highest\n, this\nweight vector of V\u03bb . Since zreg,\u03bb is irreducible as a module over N \u2217 \u03bb,reg\n\u00d7\nOp\u01e7\n\n/ Op\u01e7 (D )\n\nhomomorphism is injective. Moreover, it is clear that this map preserves the natural\nZ-gradings on both modules. Therefore the equality of the two characters established\nin Sect. 5 shows that it is an isomorphism.\n\u0003\n6.2. Second proof. Let us recall some results about Wakimoto modules of critical\nlevel from [F2] (see also [FG2]). Specifically, we will consider the module which was\n0\ndenoted by W\u03bb,\u03bac in [F2] and by Ww\ncrit,\u03bb in [FG2]. Here we will denote it simply by W\u03bb .\nAs a vector space, it is isomorphic to the tensor product\nW\u03bb = Mg \u2297 H\u03bb ,\n\n(6.1)\nwhere we use the notation\n\n\u03c1 RS,\u2212\u03bb\n)\nH\u03bb = Fun Conn\u021e (\u03c9D\n\n(see Sect. 2), and Mg is the Fock representation of a Weyl algebra with generators\na\u03b1,n , a\u2217\u03b1,n , \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206+ , n \u2208 Z.\nWe now construct a map V\u03bb \u2192 W\u03bb . Let us observe that the action of the constant\nsubalgebra g \u2282 b\ng\u03ba on the subspace\nW\u03bb0 = C[a\u2217\u03b1,0 ]\u03b1\u2208\u2206+ |0i \u2243 Fun N \u2282 Mg\n\ncoincides with the natural action of g on the contragredient Verma module M\u03bb\u2217 realized\nas Fun N . In addition, the Lie subalgebra g \u2297 t \u2297 C[[t]] \u2282 b\ngcrit acts by zero on the\nsubspace W\u03bb0 , and 1 acts as the identity.\ngcrit Therefore the injective g-homomorphism V\u03bb \u0592\u2192 M\u03bb\u2217 gives rise to a non-zero b\nhomomorphism\n\u0131\u03bb : V\u03bb \u2192 W\u03bb\n\nsending the generating subspace V\u03bb \u2282 V\u03bb to the image of V\u03bb in W\u03bb0 \u2243 M\u03bb\u2217 .\nNow we obtain a sequence of maps\n(6.2)\n\nM\u03bb \u0589 V \u03bb \u2192 W\u03bb .\n\nRecall from Sect. 3.1 that\nb\nn\n\n(M\u03bb )\u03bb+ \u2243 z\u03bb,nilp .\nWe also prove, by using the argument of Lemma 6.5 of [F2] that\nb\nn\n\n(W\u03bb )\u03bb+ = H\u03bb ,\nwhere H\u03bb is identified with the second factor of the decomposition (6.1).\n\n\f16\n\nEDWARD FRENKEL AND DENNIS GAITSGORY\n\nWe obtain the following commutative diagram, in which all maps preserve\nZ-gradings:\n\n(6.3)\nH\n\n\u221e\n2\n\nb\n\nz\u03bb,nilp\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nay\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nd\n\n(n+ ((t)), n+ [[t]], V\u03bb \u2297 \u03a80 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 H\n\n\u221e\n2\n\n(n+ ((t)), n+ [[t]], W\u03bb \u2297 \u03a80 )\n\nHere the map a is obtained as the composition\nb\nn\n\nb\nn\n\nz\u03bb,nilp \u2243 (M\u03bb )\u03bb+ \u2192 (V\u03bb )\u03bb+ \u2192 H\n\n\u221e\n2\n\nH\u03bb\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ncy\n\n(n+ ((t)), n+ [[t]], V\u03bb \u2297 \u03a80 ),\n\nthe map c as the composition\nb\nn\n\nH\u03bb \u2243 (W\u03bb )\u03bb+ \u2192 H\n\n\u221e\n2\n\n(n+ ((t)), n+ [[t]], W\u03bb \u2297 \u03a80 )\n\n(see Lemma 3), and the map b as the composition\nb\nn\n\nb\nn\n\nz\u03bb,nilp \u2243 (M\u03bb )\u03bb+ \u2192 (W\u03bb )\u03bb+ \u2243 H\u03bb .\nUsing Theorem 12.5 of [F2], we identify the map b with the homomorphism of the\nalgebras of functions corresponding to the map\n\u03c1 RS,\u2212\u03bb\nConn\u021e (\u03c9D\n)\n\u2192 Op\u03bb,nilp\n\u01e7\n\nobtained by restriction from the Miura transformation (2.3).

Let us extend the action of b\ng\u03ba to an action of b\ng\u2032\u03ba = CL0 \u22c9 b\nabove. Denote by K\u03bb the kernel of the map \u0131\u03bb . Suppose that K\u03bb 6= 0. Since both V\u03bb and\nM\u03bb become graded with respect to the extended Cartan subalgebra e\nh = (h \u2297 1) \u2295 CL0 ,\nwe find that the b\ngcrit -module K\u03bb contains a non-zero highest weight vector annihilated\nby the Lie subalgebra b\nn+ . Let \u03bc\nb be its weight. Since V\u03bb is g-integrable, so is K\u03bb , and\ntherefore the restriction of \u03bc\ne to h \u2282 e\nh is a dominant integral weight \u03bc.\nNow, since V\u03bb is a quotient of the Verma module M\u03bb , and the action of the center Zg\n(see the diagram (3.3)), we find that the same is true\non M\u03bb factors through Fun Op\u03bb,nilp\n\u01e7\nis isomorphic\nfor V\u03bb .1 According to [F2], Prop. 12.8, the degree 0 part of Fun Op\u03bb,nilp\n\u01e7\n\u2217\nW\nto (Fun h ) , and it acts on any highest weight vector v through the quotient by the\nmaximal ideal in (Fun h\u2217 )W corresponding to \u2212\u03bb \u2212 \u03c1. Moreover, its action coincides\nwith the action of the center Z(g) of U (g) on the vector v under the Harish-Chandra\nisomorphism Z(g) \u2243 (Fun h\u2217 )W followed by the sign isomorphism x 7\u2192 \u2212x. Therefore if\nv has h-weight \u03bc, the action of (Fun h\u2217 )W factors through the quotient by the maximal\nideal in (Fun h\u2217 )W corresponding to \u2212\u03bc \u2212 \u03c1. Since \u03bc is dominant integral, this implies\nthat \u03bc = \u03bb.\nThus, K\u03bb contains a non-zero highest weight vector of h-weight \u03bb. This vector then\nb\nn\nlies in (V\u03bb )\u03bb+ . But Theorem 1 and the diagram (6.3) imply that the map\nb\nn\n\n(V\u03bb )\u03bb+ \u2192 W\u03bb\nis injective. Indeed, the image of the composition\nb\nn\n\nb\nn\n\n(M\u03bb )\u03bb+ \u2192 (V\u03bb )\u03bb+ \u2192 W\u03bb\nb\nn\n\nis equal to z\u03bb,reg \u2282 H\u03bb , which is isomorphic to (V\u03bb )\u03bb+ .\nThis leads to a contradiction and hence proves the desired assertion.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe following result is also useful in applications. Note that for \u03bb = 0 it follows from\nthe corresponding statement for the associated graded module proved in [EF] or from\nthe results of [BD1], Sect. 6.2.\nTheorem 5. For any dominant integral weight \u03bb the Weyl module V\u03bb is free as a\n-module.\nFun Op\u03bb,reg\n\u01e7\nProof. Recall from Sect. 6.1 that V\u03bb carries an action of the Lie algebroid\ncompatible with the action of zreg,\u03bb = Fun(Op\u03bb,reg\nN \u2217 \u03bb,reg\n). According to the\n\u01e7\n\u00d7\nOp\u01e7\n\n/ Op\u01e7 (D )\n\nresults of [FG2], Sect. 4.6, this Lie algebroid is nothing but the Atiyah algebroid of the\nuniversal \u01e6-bundle on Op\u03bb,reg\nwhose fiber at \u03c7 \u2208 Op\u03bb,reg\nis the fiber of the \u01e6-torsor on\n\u01e7\n\u01e7\nD underlying \u03c7 at 0 \u2208 D. This bundle is isomorphic (non-canonically) to the trivial\n. Let us choose such an isomorphism. Then N \u2217 \u03bb,reg\n\u01e6-bundle on Op\u03bb,reg\n\u01e7\n\u00d7\nOp\u01e7\n\nsplits as a direct sum of the Lie algebra\nthe Lie algebra \u01e7 \u2297\n\n)\nVect(Op\u03bb,reg\n\u01e7\n\nof vector fields on\n\n/ Op\u01e7 (D )\nand\nOp\u03bb,reg\n\u01e7\n\n).\nFun(Op\u03bb,reg\n\u01e7\n\n1We have already determined in Proposition 3 that the support of V is contained in Op\u03bb,reg , but\n\u03bb\n\u01e7\n\nit is not necessary to use this result here.\n\n\f18\n\nEDWARD FRENKEL AND DENNIS GAITSGORY\n\n) on V\u03bb compatible with the action of\nThus, we obtain an action of Vect(Op\u03bb,reg\n\u01e7\n) are Z). Note that the algebra zreg,\u03bb and the Lie algebra Vect(Op\u03bb,reg\nFun(Op\u03bb,reg\n\u01e7\n\u01e7\nis an infinitegraded by the operator L0 = \u2212t\u2202t . According to Lemma 2, Op\u03bb,reg\n\u01e7\ndimensional affine space, and there exists a system of coordinates xi , i = 1, 2, . . ., on it\nsuch that these coordinates are homogeneous with respect to L0 . The character formula\n(5.3) shows that the degrees of all of these generators are strictly positive.\nThus, we find that the action on V\u03bb of the polynomial algebra Fun(Op\u03bb,reg\n) generated\n\u01e7\nby the xi 's extends to an action of the Weyl algebra generated by the xi 's and the\n\u2202/\u2202xi 's. Recall that the Z-grading on V\u03bb with respect to the operator L0 takes nonnegative integer values. Repeating the argument of Lemma 6.2.2 of [BD1] (see Lemma\n).\n\u0003\n9.13 of [Kac]), we obtain that V\u03bb is a free module over zreg,\u03bb = Fun(Op\u03bb,reg\n\u01e7\nReferences\n[Ar]\nT.
