We\nconsider whether the alternating cone has integral vectors in a given box, and use residual graph\ntechniques to reduce this problem to the one of searching for an alternating trail connecting two\ngiven vertices. The latter problem, called alternating reachability, is solved in a companion paper\nalong with related results.\n\n1. Introduction and Summary\nConsider a directed graph. Assign a nonnegative real weight to every arc so that at every vertex,\nthe total weight of the incoming arcs is equal to the total weight of the outgoing arcs. The set of all\nsuch assignments forms a convex polyhedral cone in the arc space, called the cone of circulations,\nand is a basic object of study in network flow theory. For instance, placing integral upper and\nlower bounds on every arc and asking whether there is an integral vector in the cone of circulations\nmeeting these bounds leads to Hoffman's circulation theorem (see the book [FF]). Now consider an\nundirected analog of the situation above. Take an undirected graph whose edges have been colored\nred and blue. Assign a nonnegative real weight to every edge so that at every vertex, the total\nweight of the incident red edges equals the total weight of the incident blue edges. The set of all\nsuch assignments forms a convex polyhedral cone in the edge space, called the alternating cone. In\nthis paper and the companion paper [BPS2], we study the basic theory of the alternating cone. Here\nwe consider its extreme rays, integral vectors, and dimension. We also relate it to threshold graphs\nand majorization order on degree sequences. We reduce the problem of finding an integral vector\nin the alternating cone whose components satisfy given upper and lower bounds to the problem of\nsearching for an alternating trail connecting two given vertices in a 2-colored graph (recall that in\nthe directed case, the corresponding problem is reduced to the problem of searching for a directed\npath from one given vertex to another in a suitable residual directed graph). This latter problem,\ncalled alternating reachability, generalizes the problem of searching for an augmenting path with\nrespect to a matching in a non-bipartite graph and is solved in [BPS2] by generalizing the blossom\nforest algorithm of Edmonds. We now give precise definitions and an outline of our results.\nLet G = (V, E) be an undirected graph (we allow parallel edges but not loops). Assume that the\nedges of G are colored red or blue, the coloring being given by C : E \u2192 {R, B}. We say that (G, C)\nDate: October 22, 2005; Revised October 12, 2006; minor typo January 9, 2007.

An integral vector in the alternating cone\nis a 2-colored graph. Consider the real vector space RE , with coordinates indexed by the set of edges\nof G. We write an element x \u2208 RE as x = (x(e) : e \u2208 E). For a subset F \u2286 E and v \u2208 V , F (v)\ndenotes the set of all edges in F incident with v. For a subset F \u2286 E, FR (respectively, FB ) denotes\nE\nthe set of red (respectively,\n\u001a blue) edges in F . For an edge e \u2208 E, the characteristic vector \u03c7(e) \u2208 R\n1, if f = e\nis defined by \u03c7(e)(f ) =\n.

Figure 1 illustrates a 2-colored graph together\nwith an integral vector in its alternating cone.\nIf G = (V, E) is a simple graph, we think of the elements of E as 2-element subsets\nof V . In\n\u0010\n\u0001\u0011\nV\nb\nthis case the 2-colored simple graph associated to G is the complete graph G = V, 2 , where\n\u0001\ne = {i, j} \u2208 V2 is colored red if e \u2208 E and colored blue if e 6\u2208 E.\nLet G = (V, E) be a graph. A walk in G is a sequence\n\n(3)\n\nW\n\n= (v0 , e1 , v1 , e2 , v2 , . . . , em , vm ),\n\nm \u2265 0,\n\nwhere vi \u2208 V for all i, ej \u2208 E for all j, and ej has endpoints vj\u22121 and vj for all j. We say that\nW is a v0 -vm walk of length m. We call e1 the first edge of W and em the last edge of W . We\nsay that v1 , v2 , . . . , vm\u22121 are the internal vertices of the walk W . Note that since we are allowing\nrepetitions, the vertices v0 , vm could also be internal vertices. The walk W R is the vm -v0 walk\nobtained P\nby reversing the sequence (3). The characteristic vector of the walk W is defined to be\nm\n\u03c7(W ) = i=1 \u03c7(ei ).\nThe walk W is said to be\nclosed\na trail\na path\n\nwhen v0 = vm ;\nwhen the edges e1 , . . . , em are distinct;\nwhen the edges e1 , . . . , em are distinct and the vertices v0 , . . . , vm are distinct;\n\n\fALTERNATING CONES\n\na cycle\n\n3\n\nwhen W is closed, the edges e1 , . . . , em are distinct, and the vertices v0 , . . . , vm\u22121 are\ndistinct.\n\nWe have defined paths and cycles as special classes of walks. However, sometimes it is more convenient to think of paths and cycles as subgraphs, as is done usually. This will be clear from the\ncontext. If W1 is a u-v walk and W2 is a v-w walk, then the concatenation of W1 and W2 , denoted\nW1 \u2217 W2 , is the u-w walk obtained by walking from u to v along W1 and continuing by walking from\nv to w along W2 . Note that if W1 and W2 are trails, then W1 \u2217 W2 is a trail whenever W1 and W2\nhave no edges in common.\nNow let (G, C) be a 2-colored graph. The walk W in (3) is said to be\ninternally alternating\nwhen C(ej ) 6= C(ej+1 ) for each j = 1, . . . , m \u2212 1;\nalternating\nwhen W is internally alternating and if W is closed we also have C(em ) 6= C(e1 ) (note that\na walk can be closed and internally alternating without being alternating, but if v0 6= vm ,\nthere is no distinction between internally alternating and alternating walks and we use the\nword alternating in this case); a closed alternating walk (respectively, trail) is abbreviated\nas CAW (respectively, CAT );\nan even alternating cycle\nwhen W is a cycle of even length and W is alternating (Figure 2 depicts even alternating\ncycles and their characteristic vectors); an even alternating cycle will also be called simply\nan alternating cycle;\nan odd internally alternating cycle with base v0\nwhen W is a v0 -v0 cycle of odd length and W is internally alternating (Figure 3 depicts\nodd internally alternating cycles);\nan alternating bicycle\nwhen W is alternating and is of the form W = W1 \u2217 P \u2217 W2 \u2217 P R , where W1 , W2 are odd\ninternally alternating cycles, P is a path between the bases of W1 and W2 , and the internal\nvertices of W1 , P , and W2 are disjoint (note that W1 and W2 may have the same base,\nin which case P is empty; Figure 4 depicts alternating bicycles and their characteristic\nvectors); clearly \u03c7(W ) = \u03c7(W1 ) + 2\u03c7(P ) + \u03c7(W2 ).\n1\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n1\n\nFigure 2. Even alternating cycles\nA CAW W is said to be irreducible if \u03c7(W ) cannot be written as \u03c7(W1 ) + \u03c7(W2 ) for any CAW's W1\nand W2 . For instance, alternating cycles and bicycles are easily seen to be irreducible. Similarly, a\nCAT T is said to be irreducible if \u03c7(T ) cannot be written as \u03c7(T1 ) + \u03c7(T2 ) for any CAT's T1 and\nT2 . Figure 5 depicts an irreducible CAW (with the direction of walk indicated by an arrow) and\nFigure 6 depicts an irreducible CAT. Irreducibility is easily seen.\nSection 2 considers the integral vectors, extreme rays, and dimension of the alternating cone. We\nuse a simple alternating walk argument to show that the extreme rays of the alternating cone are the\ncharacteristic vectors of alternating cycles and bicycles, the integral vectors in the alternating cone\nare sums of characteristic vectors of irreducible CAW's, and the {0, 1}-vectors in the alternating cone\n\n\f4\n\nBHATTACHARYA, PELED, AND SRINIVASAN\n\nv0\nv0\n\nFigure 3.

An irreducible CAW\nare sums of characteristic vectors of irreducible CAT's. Using the characterization of the extreme\nb = 0 (this fact\nrays, we obtain that a simple graph G is a threshold graph if and only if dim A(G)\nwas our original motivation for defining the alternating cone). It is well-known that for a simple\nb = 0 (i.e., G being threshold) depends only on the degree sequence\ngraph G, the property dim A(G)\nof G. More generally, for any 2-colored graph (G, C), we determine dim A(G, C) in terms of the red\ndegree sequence of (G, C). We then relate this dimension to the concept of majorization (following\n[AP]). Consider the set D(n) of all ordered degree sequences d = (d1 , d2 , . . . , dn ) of simple graphs\non n vertices, where d1 \u2265 d2 \u2265 * * * \u2265 dn . Partially order D(n) by majorization (the definition\nis recalled in Section 2 before Lemma 2.9). It is well-known (see [MP] and [RG]) that the set of\nmaximal elements of this poset is precisely the set of ordered degree sequences of threshold graphs.\nb where G is any simple graph with ordered degree\nDefine a map A : D(n) \u2192 N by A(d) = dim A(G),\nsequence d. We show that A is an order-reversing map (d1 \u0017 d2 implies A(d1 ) \u2264 A(d2 )). Thus, we\ncan think of A(d) as a kind of measure of how non-threshold the degree sequence d is.\nSection 3 is motivated by the following undirected analog of Hoffman's circulation problem for\ndirected graphs: let G = (V, E), C : E \u2192 {R, B} be a 2-colored graph. Assume that we are given\nnonnegative integral lower and upper bounds l, u : E \u2192 N satisfying l(e) \u2264 u(e) for all e \u2208 E. We\nare interested in knowing whether there is a vector y \u2208 A(G, C) \u2229 NE satisfying l(e) \u2264 y(e) \u2264 u(e)\n\n\fALTERNATING CONES\n\n5\n\nFigure 6. An irreducible CAT\n\nfor all e \u2208 E. We use residual graph techniques to reduce this problem to the alternating reachability\nproblem: given distinct vertices s, t in a 2-colored graph, is there an alternating s-t trail? Recall that\nin the directed case, the circulation problem is reduced to the directed reachability problem: given\ndistinct vertices s, t in a directed graph, is there a directed s-t path? This is solved by a breadth-first\nsearch algorithm, which either finds a directed s-t path or produces an s-t cut set. In [BPS2] we\ngive a polynomial-time algorithm to the alternating reachability problem generalizing the blossom\nforest algorithm of Edmonds for searching for an augmenting path with respect to a matching in a\nnon-bipartite graph. The algorithm either finds an alternating s-t trail or produces an s-t Tutte set\n(which is an obstruction to the existence of an alternating s-t trail. For the definition of a Tutte set,\nsee [BPS2]).\nCirculations in directed graphs can be thought of in terms of flows. For example, the characteristic\nvector of a directed circuit corresponds to a unit of flow along the circuit. Such an interpretation\nis not available in the case of vectors in the alternating cone; the irreducible CAW of Figure 5\ndoes not correspond to a flow in an intuitive sense. On the other hand, the characteristic vector\nof an irreducible CAT can be thought of as a unit of flow around the trail. For a 2-colored graph\nG = (V, E), C : E \u2192 {R, B}, it is thus natural to consider the convex polyhedral cone T (G, C) \u2286 RE\ngenerated by the characteristic vectors of the CAT's in (G, C). We call T (G, C) the cone of closed\nalternating trails, or simply the trail cone, of (G, C).\nConsider a CAT in a 2-colored graph. Its characteristic vector satisfies the balance condition at\nevery vertex. If we ignore the colors, the edge-set of the CAT is a disjoint union of the edge-sets\nof some cycles in the underlying graph. This shows that a nonnegative integral combination (that\nis to say, a linear combination with nonnegative integral coefficients) of characteristic vectors of\nCAT's satisfies the balance condition at every vertex and can be written as a nonnegative integral\ncombination of characteristic vectors of cycles in the underlying graph G. Let Z(G) denote the cone\nin RE generated by the characteristic vectors of the cycles in G. The linear inequalities defining Z(G)\nwere determined by Seymour [S]. The observation above shows that T (G, C) \u2286 A(G, C) \u2229 Z(G).\nIn [BPS2] we prove that T (G, C) = A(G, C) \u2229 Z(G). The proof uses our solution to the alternating\nreachability problem.\nWe remark that in this paper we focus on graph-theoretical aspects of the alternating cone and\nnot on algorithmic efficiency. We do consider algorithms, but always with a view to obtaining\ngraph-theoretical results.\n\n\f6\n\nBHATTACHARYA, PELED, AND SRINIVASAN\n\n2. Extreme Rays and Dimension of the Alternating Cone\nA simple graph G = (V, E) is said\n\u0001 to be threshold if there are real vertex weights c(v), v \u2208 V such\nthat every pair e = {u, v} \u2208 V2 satisfies c(u) + c(v) > 0 if e \u2208 E and c(u) + c(v) < 0 if e \u2208\n/ E. Our\ninitial motivation for defining the alternating cone was the following observation.\nb = 0.\nTheorem 2.1. A simple graph G = (V, E) is threshold if and only if dim A(G)\n\n\u0001\nProof. Given e \u2208 V2 , let \u03c4 (e) = (\u03c4 (e)(v) : v \u2208 V ) \u2208 RV denote the incidence vector of e, where\n\u03c4 (e)(v) is 1 if v is an endpoint of e and 0 otherwise. Let CR (G) denote the cone in RV generated\nby the incidence vectors of\u0001the edges E, and let CB (G) denote the cone generated by the incidence\nvectors of the nonedges V2 \u2212 E. If we write (1) in matrix notation, the columns correspond to the\nincidence vectors of edges and the negatives of the incidence vectors of nonedges. It follows that\nb = {0} if and only if CR (G) \u2229 CB (G) = {0}.\nA(G)\n\nOnly if: Assume that the weights c(v), v \u2208 V satisfy the defining property ofPa threshold graph.\nThis means that CR (G) and CB (G) are on opposite sides of the hyperplane v\u2208V c(v)x(v) = 0.\nHence CR (G) \u2229 CB (G) = {0}.\nIf: Suppose CR (G) \u2229PCB (G) = {0}. Then by the separation theorem of convex polyhedral cones,\nthere\nP is a hyperplane v\u2208V c(v)x(v) = 0 such that all nonzero vectors (p(v)P: v \u2208 V ) \u2208 CR (G) satisfy\nv\u2208V c(v)q(v) < 0. Thus\nv\u2208V c(v)p(v) > 0, and all nonzero vectors (q(v) : v \u2208 V ) \u2208 CB (G) satisfy\n{u, v} \u2208 E implies c(u) + c(v) > 0, and {u, v} \u2208\n/ E implies c(u) + c(v) < 0.\n\u0003\nWe now determine the extreme rays of the alternating cone.\nTheorem 2.2. Let G = (V, E), C : E \u2192 {R, B} be a 2-colored graph. Then\n(i) the extreme rays of the alternating cone A(G, C) are the characteristic vectors of the alternating cycles and bicycles in (G, C);\n(ii) every integral vector in the alternating cone is a nonnegative integral combination of the\ncharacteristic vectors of irreducible CAW's;\n(iii) every {0, 1}-vector in the alternating cone is a nonnegative integral combination of the characteristic vectors of irreducible CAT's\n(iv) the characteristic vector of an irreducible CAW is {0, 1, 2}-valued.\n\nProof. (i) Clearly, the characteristic vectors of alternating cycles and bicycles are extreme. To show\nthe converse, we will express any rational vector in the alternating cone as a nonnegative rational\ncombination of the characteristic vectors of alternating cycles and bicycles.\nLet a = (a(e) : e \u2208 E) be a nonzero rational vector in A(G, C). Pick e1 \u2208 E with a(e1 ) 6= 0. Without\nloss of generality we may assume that e1 is colored red. Let v0 and v1 be the endpoints of e1 . Build\nan alternating trail as follows: choose a blue edge e2 incident at v1 with a(e2 ) 6= 0 (this is possible\nby the balance condition). Let the other endpoint of e2 be v2 . Now choose a red edge e3 incident at\nv2 with a(e3 ) 6= 0, and so on. At some stage we will revisit an already visited vertex. Suppose this\nhappens for the first time when we choose edge ek+1 , i.e., we have built an alternating trail\n(4)\n\n(v0 , e1 , v1 , e2 , v2 , . . . , ek , vk ),\n\nk \u2265 1,\n\nwhere v0 , v1 , . . . , vk are distinct, C(ek ) 6= C(ek+1 ), and ek+1 has endpoints vk and a vertex u0 \u2208\n{v0 , v1 , . . . , vk\u22121 }. Then we have found either an alternating cycle D, or an odd internally alternating\ncycle C with base u0 . In the first case, subtracting an appropriate multiple of \u03c7(D) from a, we obtain\nanother vector in the alternating cone whose support is strictly contained in the support of a. Thus,\nby induction on the size of the support, we are done.\nIn the second case, extend C to an alternating trail C \u2217 T as follows: T starts with T = (u0 , f1 , . . .),\nwhere f1 is an edge incident with u0 and satisfies a(f1 ) 6= 0 and C(f1 ) 6= C(ek+1 ). Let the other\nendpoint of f1 be u1 . Now add to T an edge f2 incident with u1 and satisfying a(f2 ) 6= 0 and\n\n\fALTERNATING CONES\n\n7\n\nC(f2 ) 6= C(f1 ), and so on. At some stage we will revisit an already visited vertex of the trail C \u2217 T .\nSuppose this happens for the first time when we choose edge fm+1 , i.e., we have\n(5)\n\nT\n\n=\n\n(u0 , f1 , u1 , f2 , u2 , . . . , fm , um ),\n\nm \u2265 1,\n\nwhere u0 , u1 , . . . , um are distinct, none of {u1 , . . . , um } is on C (see Figure 7), C(fm+1 ) 6= C(fm ),\none endpoint of fm+1 is um , and the other endpoint v of fm+1 is either in T or is a vertex of C\ndifferent from u0 . Two cases arise:\nCase (a): v is a vertex of T (see Figure 8). We have found either an alternating cycle or an\nalternating bicycle, and we are done by induction on the size of the support, as in the previous\nparagraph.\nCase (b): v is not a vertex of T (see Figure 9). In this case, the edges f1 , . . . fm+1 together with\nan appropriate portion of C determine an alternating cycle, and we are done.\n\nu0\n\nC\n\nT\nu2\n\nu1\nf1\n\num\nfm\n\nf2\n\nFigure 7.

Illustrating the proof of Theorem 2.2 (i) Case (a)\nEssentially the same argument as given above appears in [HIP] (in the context of edges and nonedges).\n(ii) Let a = (a(e) : e \u2208 E) be a nonzero integral vector in the alternating cone. Pick an edge e1 with\na(e1 ) 6= 0 and with end points v0 and v1 . Assume that we have an internally alternating walk\n(6)\n\nW\n\n= (v0 , e1 , v1 , e2 , v2 , . . . , em , vm ),\n\nm \u2265 1,\n\nwith \u03c7(W ) \u2264 a (we can always start with the walk (v0 , e1 , v1 )). We show below that either we can\nextend W , or else there is a CAW (and hence an irreducible CAW) through e1 . Since we cannot\nextend indefinitely because of the condition \u03c7(W ) \u2264 a, we are done. The following cases arise.\nCase (a): vm 6= v0 . Then \u03c7(W ) does not satisfy the balance condition at vm , but a does, and since\n\u03c7(W ) \u2264 a and a is integral, we can find an edge em+1 incident at vm with C(em+1 ) 6= C(em ) such\nthat \u03c7(W )(em+1 ) < a(em+1 ). Extend W by adding em+1 and the other end point of em+1 .\n\n\f8\n\nBHATTACHARYA, PELED, AND SRINIVASAN\n\nC\n\nu0\n\nT\nu2\n\nu1\nf1\n\nf2\n\num\nfm\n\nfm+1\nFigure 9.

In this case W is a CAW.\n(iii) This is a special case of (ii): if a is a {0, 1}-vector, then the CAW's in (ii) must be CAT's.\n(iv) Consider a walk W as in (3). This assigns a direction of traversal to each edge; for instance, the\nedge e2 is traversed from v1 to v2 . The direction of traversal may be different for two occurrences\nof the same edge. However, if a CAW W traverses an edge three or more times, then two of these\ndirections must be the same, and this can be used to write W = W1 \u2217 W2 for two positive length\nCAW's W1 and W2 , so W is not irreducible.\n\u0003\nAs a corollary of Theorem 2.2, we derive the following well-known characterization of threshold\ngraphs.\nb contains an alternating cycle of\nCorollary 2.3. A simple graph G is not threshold if and only if G\nlength 4.\nb with the pairs\nProof. If: Suppose {{i, j}, {j, k}, {k, l}, {l, i}} is an alternating 4-cycle in G\n{i, j}, {k, l} red and the other two pairs blue. Assume that G is threshold with vertex weights\nc(v), v \u2208 V satisfying the defining property. Since {i, j}, {k, l} are red, we have c(i) + c(j) > 0,\nc(k) + c(l) > 0 and therefore c(i) + c(j) + c(k) + c(l) > 0. Similarly, since {j, k}, {l, i} are blue, we\nhave c(i) + c(j) + c(k) + c(l) < 0, a contradiction.\nb has an extreme ray, which is an alternating\nOnly if: Since G is not threshold, by Theorem 2.1 A(G)\ncycle or an alternating bicycle by Theorem 2.2. Suppose that this extreme ray is an alternating cycle\nb that splits this cycle into two even cycles (since G\nb\nof length greater than 4. There is a chord of G\nis complete). Regardless of the color of the chord, one of these two cycles is alternating. Repeating\nthis argument, we obtain an alternating cycle of length 4.\nNow consider an extreme ray that is an alternating bicycle W = W1 \u2217 P \u2217 W2 \u2217 P R . Let u and v be\nthe bases of W1 and W2 . Let u\u2032 (respectively, v \u2032 ) be any vertex of W1 (respectively, W2 ) different\nb W1 determines two alternating u\u2032 -u paths,\nfrom u (respectively, v). Consider the edge {u\u2032 , v \u2032 } of G.\nand one of them starts with an edge having color different from that of {u\u2032 , v \u2032 }. Call this alternating\npath P1 . Similarly, using W2 , choose an alternating v \u2032 -v path P2 that starts with an edge having\ncolor different from that of {u\u2032 , v \u2032 }. We now have the alternating cycle P1 \u2217 P \u2217 P2R \u2217 (v \u2032 , {v \u2032 , u\u2032 }, u\u2032 ),\nand we can use the argument of the preceding paragraph.\n\u0003\nWe now give a formula for the dimension of the alternating cone of a 2-colored graph.\n\n\fALTERNATING CONES\n\n9\n\nA connected graph is said to be odd unicyclic if it contains precisely one cycle, and that cycle has\nodd length. In other words, an odd unicyclic graph is obtained from a tree by adding a new edge\nbetween two nonadjacent vertices of the tree so that the cycle created has odd length. A graph is\na pseudo forest if each component of the graph is either acyclic or odd unicyclic. Pseudo forests\nare to be distinguished from 1-forests, which are graphs whose connected components have at most\none cycle, even or odd. The motivation for studying 1-forests is combinatorial while pseudo forests\nhave a linear algebraic origin (see Theorem 2.4 below). Recall from the proof of Theorem 2.1 that\nfor an edge e, the vector \u03c4 (e) \u2208 RV is the incidence vector of e, which is 1 in the two coordinates\nindexed by the endpoints of e, and is 0 elsewhere. The incidence matrix of a graph is the matrix\nwhose columns are the incidence vectors of the edges. For a proof of the following result see [GKS].\nTheorem 2.4. For a graph G = (V, E) and a set X \u2286 E, the set {\u03c4 (e) : e \u2208 X} is linearly\nindependent in RV if and only if the graph (V, X) is a pseudo forest. In particular, the rank of the\nincidence matrix of G is equal to #V \u2212 number of bipartite components of G.\nFor a graph G = (V, E) and an integer sequence d = (d(v) : v \u2208 V ), we use the notation\nK(d) = {C : E \u2192 {R, B} : the red degree of v is d(v) for all v \u2208 V },\ni.e., K(d) denotes the set of all 2-colorings of G having red degree sequence d.\nLemma 2.5. Consider the 2-colored graph G = (V, E) with a coloring C \u2208 K(d), and let e \u2208 E. If\n(G, C) has a CAW through e, then for each C \u2032 \u2208 K(d), (G, C \u2032 ) has a CAW through e.\nProof. Let C \u2032 \u2208 K(d) and consider the spanning subgraph G\u2032 = (V, E \u2032 ) of G, where E \u2032 consists of\nall the edges where C and C \u2032 disagree.\nSince the red degrees (and thus also the blue degrees) in G agree under C and C \u2032 , it follows that for\neach v \u2208 V , the red degree of v in (G\u2032 , C \u2032 ) is equal to the blue degree of v in (G\u2032 , C \u2032 ). Thus the all-1\n\u2032\nvector in RE is balanced in (G\u2032 , C \u2032 ), i.e., is in A(G\u2032 , C \u2032 ). It follows from Theorem 2.2(iii) that for\n\u2032\neach e \u2208 E , (G\u2032 , C \u2032 ) has a CAT through e, and therefore so does (G, C \u2032 ).\nNow let W be a CAW through e in (G, C). If C(e) 6= C \u2032 (e), then we already know that (G, C \u2032 ) has a\nCAT through e, and we are done. So we may assume that C(e) = C \u2032 (e). We will transform W into\na CAW W \u2032 through e in (G, C \u2032 ). Let f be an edge in W with endpoints u and v. If C(f ) = C \u2032 (f ),\nwe do nothing. If C(f ) 6= C \u2032 (f ), then f \u2208 E \u2032 and (G, C \u2032 ) has a CAT through f . Dropping f from\nthis CAT, we obtain u-v alternating trail P in (G, C \u2032 ) whose first and last edges have the color C(f ).\nWe drop f from W and substitute the trail P in its place. Doing this for every edge f in W with\nC(f ) 6= C \u2032 (f ), we obtain a CAW W \u2032 through e in (G, C \u2032 ).\n\u0003\nFor a graph G and an integer sequence d, let Ed be the set of all edges e of G such that some\n2-coloring in K(d) has a CAW through e (equivalently by Lemma 2.5, all 2-colorings in K(d) have a\nCAW through e).\nTheorem 2.6. Let G = (V, E) be a graph and C a 2-coloring of G with red degree sequence d. Then\ndim A(G, C) = #Ed \u2212 #V + b(V, Ed ),\nwhere b(V, Ed ) denotes the number of bipartite components of the graph (V, Ed ).\nProof. An edge e \u2208 E is said to be inessential if x(e) = 0 for all x \u2208 A(G, C). From Theorem 2.2(ii)\nit follows that e is inessential if and only if (G, C) has no CAW through e. From basic polyhedral\ntheory it now follows that dim A(G, C) is equal to the nullity (i.e., number of columns minus rank) of\nthe #V \u00d7 #Ed vertex-edge incidence matrix of the graph (V, Ed ). The expression for the dimension\nnow follows from Theorem 2.4.\n\u0003\nFrom Theorem 2.6, dim A(G, C) depends only on G and the red degree sequence of C. In the case\nof the associated 2-colored graphs of simple graphs we can say more.\n\n\f10\n\nBHATTACHARYA, PELED, AND SRINIVASAN\n\nLemma 2.7.

However, it is easily seen that the dimensions of the alternating\ncones of the 2-colored graphs are 1 and 0, respectively.

We begin with\na few definitions.\nLet a = (a(1), . . . , a(n)) and b = (b(1), . . . , b(n)) be real sequences of length n. Denote the i-th\nlargest component of a (respectively, b) by a[i] (respectively, b[i]).

The majorization is strict, denoted by a \u227b b, if at least one of the inequalities\nis strict, namely if a is not a permutation of b. We recall a fundamental lemma about majorization\nin integer sequences, called Muirhead's lemma. If a = (a(1), . . . , a(n)) is a sequence and there exist\ni and j such that a(i) \u2265 a(j) + 2, then the following operation is called a unit transformation from\ni to j on a: subtract 1 from a(i) and add 1 to a(j). Clearly, if b is obtained from a by a sequence\nof unit transformations, then a \u227b b. The converse is also true for integer sequences.\nTheorem 2.9 (Muirhead Lemma). If a and b are integer sequences and a \u227b b, then some permutation of b can be obtained from a by a sequence of unit transformations.\nFor a proof see [MP, MO].\nTheorem 2.10.

First choose a pseudo forest (V, X) such that the columns corresponding to\nX form a basis of the column space of the vertex-edge incidence matrix of G. For each e \u2208 E \u2212 X\nwe have x(e) = l(e) or x(e) = u(e). Now solve for the remaining x(e), e \u2208 X using the balance\ncondition at every node. Since l, u are integral and the determinant of the incidence matrix of an\n\u0003\nodd cycle is \u00b12, the half-integrality of x easily follows, and y = 2x is as required.\nMotivated by Theorem 3.1, we want to improve half-integrality to integrality, so we are led to the\nfollowing problem. Let a 2-colored graph G = (V, E), C : E \u2192 {R, B} and bounds l, u : E \u2192 N\nbe given. For f \u2208 A(G, C), an edge e is called feasible w.r.t. f if l(e) \u2264 f (e) \u2264 u(e), and f itself\nis called feasible if every edge is feasible w.r.t. f , infeasible otherwise. We ask if there is a feasible\nvector f \u2208 A(G, C) \u2229 NE . We now reduce this problem to the problem of finding a CAT through a\ngiven edge in a 2-colored graph. This latter problem is easily reduced to the alternating reachability\nproblem.\nLet f \u2208 A(G, C) \u2229 NE , f not necessarily feasible. The residual 2-colored graph G(f ) = (V, E(f )) of\nf w.r.t. l, u is defined as follows. We take four disjoint copies E1 , E2 , E3 , E4 of E, and denote the\ncopy of e \u2208 E in Ei by ei , i = 1, . . . , 4. For each e \u2208 E, we place e1 in E(f ) with the color C(e)\nwhen f (e) \u2264 u(e) \u2212 1, place e2 in E(f ) with the color C(e) when f (e) \u2264 u(e) \u2212 2, place e3 in E(f )\nwith the color opposite C(e) when f (e) \u2265 l(e) + 1, and place e4 in E(f ) with the color opposite C(e)\nwhen f (e) \u2265 l(e) + 2.\nSuppose that G(f ) has a CAT T . We extend the characteristic vector \u03c7(T ) by adding zero components at all elements of E1 \u222a E2 \u222a E3 \u222a E4 \u2212 E(f ). By augmenting f along T we mean replacing f\nwith fT given by\nfT (e) = f (e) + \u03c7(T )(e1 ) + \u03c7(T )(e2 ) \u2212 \u03c7(T )(e3 ) \u2212 \u03c7(T )(e4 ),\n\ne \u2208 E.\n\nNote that fT \u2208 A(G, C) \u2229 NE , and that in replacing f with fT , feasible edges remains feasible, the\ninfeasible edges of T move \"in the right direction\", i.e., become feasible or move closer to feasibility,\nand of course the edges out of T remain unchanged.\nTheorem 3.2. Suppose f \u2208 A(G, C)\u2229NE is infeasible, but A(G, C)\u2229NE has a feasible vector. Then\nfor each e \u2208 E,\n(i) if f (e) < l(e), then G(f ) has a CAT through e1 ;\n(ii) if f (e) > u(e), then G(f ) has a CAT through e3 .\nProof. We define a 2-colored subgraph G\u2032 (f ) = (V, E \u2032 (f )) of G(f ) by letting E \u2032 (f ) = E(f )\u2229(E1 \u222aE3 )\nand restricting the 2-coloring of G(f ) to G\u2032 (f ).\n\n\fALTERNATING CONES\n\n13\n\nLet g \u2208 A(G, C) \u2229 NE be a feasible vector. We define h : E \u2032 (f ) \u2192 N as follows: for e1 \u2208 E \u2032 (f ),\n\u001a\n0\nif g(e) \u2212 f (e) < 0,\nh(e1 ) =\ng(e) \u2212 f (e) if g(e) \u2212 f (e) \u2265 0,\nand for e3 \u2208 E \u2032 (f ),\nh(e3 ) =\n\n\u001a\n\n0\nif g(e) \u2212 f (e) > 0,\n\u2212(g(e) \u2212 f (e)) if g(e) \u2212 f (e) \u2264 0.\n\nIt is easy to check that h is an integral vector in the alternating cone of G\u2032 (f ).\n(i) Assume that e \u2208 E with f (e) < l(e). Then e1 \u2208 E \u2032 (f ) and h(e1 ) > 0 (since g is feasible). By\nTheorem 2.2(ii), h can be written as a sum of characteristic vectors of irreducible CAW's in G\u2032 (f ),\nand thus G\u2032 (f ) has an irreducible CAW W through e1 . By Theorem 2.2(iv), \u03c7(W ) is {0, 1, 2}-valued.\nSuppose \u03c7(W )(a1 ) = 2 for some a1 (respectively, \u03c7(W )(a3 ) = 2 for some a3 ). Then g(a) \u2212 f (a) \u2265 2\n(respectively, f (a) \u2212 g(a) \u2265 2). Since g is feasible, a2 \u2208 E(f ) (respectively, a4 \u2208 E(f )), and\nconsequently a1 \u2208 E(f ) (respectively, a3 \u2208 E(f )) by the definition of E(f ). We then consider W\nas a subset of E(f ) and replace the double occurrence of a1 (respectively, a3 ) in W by a single\noccurrence of a1 and of a2 (respectively, of a3 and of a4 ). Doing this for all repeated edges in W\ntransforms it into a CAT in G(f ) through e1 .\n(ii) Similar to (i).\n\n\u0003\n\nThe problem of finding a CAT through a given edge e in an edge-colored graph can be reduced to\nthe alternating reachability problem as follows: let e have endpoints s and t. Remove e from the\ngraph, add two new vertices s\u2032 and t\u2032 , add two new edges with color C(e), one between s\u2032 and s and\none between t\u2032 and t. Clearly the new graph has an alternating s\u2032 -t\u2032 trail if and only if the original\ngraph has a CAT through e.\nWe can now use the following familiar scheme to look for a feasible integral vector. Start with an\nintegral balanced f : E \u2192 N, for example f = 0. If f is infeasible, construct G(f ). Pick an edge\ne \u2208 E with f (e) < l(e) (respectively, f (e) > u(e)), and find a CAT T through e1 (respectively, e3 )\nin G(f ) if one exists (using the alternating reachability algorithm in [BPS2]), then augment f along\nT . As noted in the proof of Theorem 3.2, fT is integral and balanced, feasible edges remain feasible,\nand in addition each infeasible edge in T , in particular e, has either become feasible or has moved\ncloser to feasibility. Replace f with fT and repeat. Since we are working with integral vectors,\neither we terminate with a feasible integral vector in time bounded by the total infeasibility, or else\nat some stage Gf has no CAT through e1 (respectively, e3 ), in which case no feasible integral vector\nexists by Theorem 3.2.\nAs stated in the introduction, in this paper we are not dealing with efficiency issues but only with the\ngraph-theoretic aspects of the alternating cone. Our discussion motivates the alternating reachability\nproblem and the problem of determining the linear inequalities defining the trail cone. These two\nproblems are considered in [BPS2].\nAcknowledgement: We thank the referees for their constructive suggestions that led to an improvement in the exposition.\nReferences\n[AP] S. R.
