Introduction\nJ.-P. Serre [36] raised the following question in 1953: If Y is a complex manifold\nwith H i (Y, \u03a9jY ) = 0 for all j \u2265 0 and i > 0, then what is Y ? Is Y Stein? Here\n\u03a9jY is the sheaf of holomorphic j-forms and the cohomology is \u010cech cohomology.\nA complex space Y is Stein if and only if H i (Y, G) = 0 for every analytic coherent\nsheaf G on Y and all positive integers i. For a holomorphic variety Y , it is Stein\nif and only if it is both holomorphically convex and holomorphically separable [13,\nPage 14]). We say that Y is holomorphically convex if for any discrete sequence\n{yn } \u2282 Y , there is a holomorphic function f on Y such that the supremum of the\nset {|f (yn )|} is \u221e. Y is holomorphically separable if for every pair x, y \u2208 Y , x 6= y,\nthere is a holomorphic function f on Y such that f (x) 6= f (y).\nTo investigate Serre's question, we are interested in the classification of algebraic\nmanifolds (i.e., irreducible smooth algebraic varieties defined over C) with vanishing Hodge cohomology. Since the associated analytic variety of an affine variety is\nStein [15, Chapter VI, Proposition 3.1], it is natural to ask the algebraic analogue\nof Serre's question: if Y is a smooth quasi-projective variety with H i (Y, \u03a9jY ) = 0\nfor all j \u2265 0 and i > 0 (from now on \u03a9jY is the sheaf of regular j-forms and the\ncohomology is still \u010cech cohomology), then is Y affine? The answer is no even\nin surface case [24]. There are three types of surfaces and two of them are not\naffine since they have no nonconstant regular functions [24, Lemma 1.8]. Curve\ncase is trivial since Y is not complete by Serre duality and any noncomplete curve\n1\n\n\f2\n\nJING ZHANG\n\nis affine [15, Chapter II, Proposition 4.1]. We have classified threefolds with vanishing Hodge cohomology in our previous papers [42, 43, 44, 45]. It again shows\nthat Y may not be affine.\nIt is obvious that H i (Y, \u03a9jY ) = 0 for all j \u2265 0 and i > 0 is a necessary condition\nfor Y being affine since \u03a9jY is coherent [14, Chapter III, Section 5]. Conversely,\nsince the vanishing Hodge cohomology is not a sufficient condition, a further question is: What condition should we add such that Y is affine? This question is\nvery interesting on its own because among algebraic varieties, affine varieties are\nbasic, natural and important. To study a nonaffine variety, we can cover it by\naffine varieties and examine the local data then glue them together to get global\ninformation by cohomology.\nNow we translate our question to a purely algebraic geometry question: When\nis a quasi-projective variety (or a scheme) affine? There are many criteria for\naffineness. Here we only mention what we know. There may be other results we\nare not aware of.\nSerre's well-known criterion says that a variety Y is affine if and only if H i (Y, F ) =\n0 for every coherent sheaf F on Y and all positive integers i [15, Chapter II, Section 1, Theorem 1.1]. Goodman and Hartshorne proved that Y is affine if and only\nif Y contains no complete curves and the dimension h1 (Y, F ) of the linear space\nH 1 (Y, F ) is bounded for all coherent sheaf F on Y [11]. Let X be the completion\nof Y . Goodman also proved that Y is affine if and only if after suitable blowing\nup the closed subvariety on the boundary X \u2212 Y , the new boundary X \u2032 \u2212 Y is\nthe support of an ample divisor, where X \u2032 \u2192 X is the blowing up with center in\nX \u2212 Y [10; 15, Chapter 2, Theorem 6.1]. Let D be the effective boundary divisor\nwith support X \u2212 Y , then Y is affine if D is ample. So if we can show the ampleness of D, Y is affine. There are two important criteria for ampleness due to\nNakai-Moishezon and Kleiman [22; 23, Chapter 1, Section 1.5]. Another sufficient\ncondition is that if Y contains no complete curves and the linear system |nD| is\nbase point free, then Y is affine [15, Chapter 2, Page 64]. Therefore we can apply\nbase point free theorem if we know the numerical condition of D [ 32; 23, Chapter\n3, Page 75, Theorem 3.3]. Neeman Proved that if Y (the associated scheme of Y )\ncan be embedded in an affine scheme, then Y is affine if and only if H i (Y, OY ) = 0\nfor all i > 0 [29].\nIn higher dimension (at least, in our problem), it is very hard to check the\nampleness of a big (even big and nef) divisor D and the base point freeness of the\nlinear system |nD|. In [45], only for a threefold and a prime divisor D, we show\nthat |nD| is base point free for all sufficiently large n.\nThe theory of D-dimension and Iitaka fibration is widely used in the classification\nof algebraic varieties [17-20, 26, 39]. The notion of D-dimension is due to Iitaka\n[17]: If for all m > 0, H 0 (X, OX (mD)) = 0, then the D-dimension \u03ba(D, X) = \u2212\u221e.\nOtherwise,\n\u03ba(D, X) = tr.degC \u2295m\u22650 H 0 (X, OX (mD)) \u2212 1.\nBased on the classification of surfaces [24], for threefolds, Mohan Kumar conjectured that Y is affine if and only if H i (Y, \u03a9jY ) = 0 for all j \u2265 0, i > 0 and\n\n\fHODGE COHOMOLOGY CRITERIA FOR AFFINE VARIETIES\n\n3\n\n\u03ba(D, X) = 3, i.e., there are 3 algebraically independent nonconstant regular functions on Y , where X is the smooth completion of Y and D is the boundary divisor\nwith support X \u2212 Y . If Y is a smooth threefold and X \u2212 Y is a smooth projective\nsurface, we have proved this conjecture in [45]. In fact, we can drop the smoothness\nassumption when Y is a threefold.\nWe work over the complex number field C.\nTheorem 1.1. If Y is a quasi-projective threefold, then Y is affine if and only if\nH i (Y, \u03a9jY ) = 0 for all j \u2265 0, i > 0 and \u03ba(D, X) = 3, where X is a completion of\nY and D is an effective boundary divisor with support X \u2212 Y .\nIn higher dimension, we have the following conjecture.\nConjecture 1.2. An algebraic manifold Y of dimension n is affine if and only if\nH i (Y, \u03a9jY ) = 0 for all j \u2265 0, i > 0 and \u03ba(D, X) = n.\nIn fact, we can prove a more general theorem since we do not require the smoothness of the variety.\nDefinition 1.3. We say that Y satisfies the condition A if the following three\nconditions hold\n(1) the boundary X \u2212 Y is connected;\n(2) X \u2212 Y is of pure codimension 1 in X;\n(3) every closed subvariety Z of codimension 1 in Y is affine.\nTheorem 1.4. If Y is an irreducible quasi-projective variety with dimension n \u2265 1,\nthen Y is affine if and only if the following three conditions are satisfied:\n(1) Y satisfied condition A;\n(2) \u03ba(D, X) \u2265 1;\n(3) H i (Y, OY ) = 0 for all i > 0.\nTheorem 1.5. If Y is a smooth quasi-projective variety with dimension n, then\nY is affine if and only if H i (Y, \u03a9jY ) = 0 for all j \u2265 0, i > 0 and \u03ba(D, X) = n.\nBy the result in [42], if Y is an algebraic manifold with H i (Y, \u03a9jY ) = 0 for all\nj \u2265 0, i > 0 and \u03ba(D, X) \u2265 1, then there is a surjective morphism from Y to a\nsmooth affine curve C such that a general fibre is smooth and irreducible. In [42],\nwe asked whether Y is affine if the general fibre is affine. By the above theorem,\nit is easy to see that the answer is yes.\nTheorem 1.6. If Y is a smooth quasi-projective variety with dimension n, then\nY is affine if and only if H i (Y, \u03a9jY ) = 0 for all j \u2265 0, i > 0, \u03ba(D, X) \u2265 1 and the\ngeneral fibre of Y \u2192 C is affine.\nTheorem 1.7. If Y is a smooth quasi-projective variety with dimension n, then Y\nis affine if and only if H i (Y, \u03a9jY ) = 0 for all j \u2265 0, i > 0, \u03ba(D, X) \u2265 1 and every\nclosed subvariety of codimension 1 is affine.\nThe following corollary is a partial answer to J.-P. Serre's Steinness question.\n\n\f4\n\nJING ZHANG\n\nCorollary 1.8. If an n-dimensional algebraic manifold Y with H i (Y, \u03a9jY ) = 0 for\nall j \u2265 0 and i > 0 has D-dimension n, then Y is Stein.\nDefinition 1.9. An algebraic variety Y is regularly separable if for any two distinct\npoints y1 and y2 on Y , there is a regular function f on Y such that f (y1) 6= f (y2 ).\nCorollary 1.10. If an algebraic manifold Y of dimension n satisfies H i (Y, \u03a9jY ) = 0\nfor all j \u2265 0 and i > 0, then the following conditions are equivalent\n(1) Y is affine;\n(2) Y is regularly separable;\n(3) any closed subvariety of codimension 1 in Y is affine;\n(4) \u03ba(D, X) = n.\nThis paper is organized as follows. We will give two preliminary lemmas and\nreview some known results in Section 2 and prove the above theorems in Section\n3. The main idea of our proof is to show that Y is regularly separable, i.e., for\nany two distinct points y1 and y2 , there is a regular function H on Y such that\nH(y1 ) 6= H(y2 ). Then we have an injective birational morphism from the associated scheme of Y to Spec\u0393(Y, OY ). Therefore we can apply Zariski's Main Theorem\n[27, Chapter III, Section 9] and Neeman's result [29].\nAcknowledgments I would like to thank the following professors for helpful\ndiscussions: Steven Dale Cutkosky, Dan Edidin, N.Mohan Kumar, Zhenbo Qin and\nQi Zhang. In particular, I thank Mohan Kumar who suggested me to construct an\nembedding then use Neeman's result.\n2. Preliminary Lemmas\nThe proof of Lemma 2.1 is essentially due to Mohan Kumar [24]. We include a\nproof here for completeness.\nLemma 2.1. Let Y be a smooth quasi-projective variety with H i (Y, \u03a9jY ) = 0 for\nevery j \u2265 0 and i > 0. Let X be the projective variety containing Y , then X \u2212 Y\nis connected.\nP roof . If X \u2212 Y = Z is not connected, write Z = Z1 + Z2 , where both Z1 and\nZ2 are closed in Z, nonempty and Z1 \u2229 Z2 = \u2205. Let dimY =n. We have a long exact\nsequence of local cohomology [14, Page 212]\n0 = H n\u22121(Y, \u03a9nY ) \u2212\u2192 HZn (X, \u03a9nX ) \u2212\u2192 H n (X, \u03a9nX ) \u2212\u2192 H n (Y, \u03a9nY ) = 0.\nBy Serre duality\nHZn (X, \u03a9nX ) = H n (X, \u03a9nX ) = H 0 (X, OX ) = C.\nBut by Mayer-Vietoris sequence [14, Page 212],\nHZn (X, \u03a9nX ) \u223c\n= HZn1 (X, \u03a9nX ) \u2295 HZn2 (X, \u03a9nX ).\nBoth summands are at least one dimensional since\nHZni (X, \u03a9nX ) \u2212\u2192 H n (X, \u03a9nX ) = C \u2212\u2192 H n (X \u2212 Zi , \u03a9nX ) = 0,\n\n\fHODGE COHOMOLOGY CRITERIA FOR AFFINE VARIETIES\n\n5\n\nwhere the last cohomology vanishes because X \u2212 Zi is not complete [21, 37]. This\nis a contradiction.\nQ.E.D.\nRemark 2.2. The above proof also works for singular varieties because for singular\ncomplete varieties, we have Grothendieck duality [1, Chapter I, 1.3]: H n (X, \u03c9X ) \u223c\n=\nC.\nRecall an equivalent definition of D-dimension. If h0 (X, OX (mD)) > 0 for\nsome m \u2208 Z and X is normal, choose a basis {f0 , f1 , * * *, fn } of the linear space\nH 0 (X, OX (mD)), it defines a rational map \u03a6|mD| from X to the projective space\nPn by sending a point x on X to (f0 (x), f1 (x), * * *, fn (x)) in Pn . By definition of\nD-dimension [39, Definition 5.1],\n\u03ba(D, X) = max{dim(\u03a6|mD| (X))}.\nm\n\nLemma 2.3. Let X, Y be as above and n be the dimension of Y . Then Y contains\nno complete curves if \u03ba(D, X) = n, where D is an effective divisor with support\nX \u2212Y.\nP roof . We will prove the claim by induction on the dimension of Y . The claim\nis trivial if Y is a curve since Y is not complete by Serre duality. The surface case\nwas proved in [24]. Assume that the claim holds for every (n \u2212 1)-dimensional\nvariety with the same property. Suppose now dimY = n. If Y has a connected\ncomplete curve C, pick a point p on C. Let Z be a smooth prime principal divisor\npassing through p (for the existence of Z, see Step 2 of proof of Theorem 1.5 in\nnext section). Let f \u2208 H 0 (Y, OY ) be the defining function of Z, then we have the\nfollowing short exact sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 \u03a9jY \u2212\u2192 \u03a9jY \u2212\u2192 \u03a9jY |Z \u2212\u2192 0,\nwhere the first map is defined by f . Thus for all i > 0 and j \u2265 0, we have\nH i (Z, \u03a9jY |Z ) = 0.\nIn particulsr, H i (Z, OZ ) = 0.

By the inductive assumption, Z contains no complete\ncurves.\nConsider the morphism from Y to C\nf : Y \u2212\u2192 C.\n\u22121\n\nWe know p \u2208 Z = f (0), a prime principal divisor defined by f . Since C is\nconnected, C \u2282 Z. This is in contradiction with the fact that Z has no complete\ncurves.\nThe proof is completed.\n\n\f6\n\nJING ZHANG\n\nQ.E.D.\nTheorem 2.4. [Fujita] Let D be an effective Q-divisor on a normal projective\nsurface X. Then there exists a unique decomposition\nD =P +N\nsatisfying the following conditions:\n(1) N is an effective Q-divisor and either N=0 or the intersection matrix of the\nirreducible components of N is negative definite;\n(2) P is a nef Q-divisor and the intersection of P with each irreducible component\nof N is zero.\nLemma 2.5. [Sakai] Let D = P + N be the Zariski decomposition of an effective\ndivisor D on a normal complete surface X, then \u03ba(D, X) = 2 if and only if P 2 > 0.\nTheorem 2.6. [Iitaka] Let X be a normal projective variety and let D be an\neffective divisor on X. Then there exist two positive numbers \u03b1 and \u03b2 such that\nfor all sufficiently large n we have\n\u03b1n\u03ba(D,X) \u2264 h0 (X, OX (nD)) \u2264 \u03b2n\u03ba(D,X) .\nWe say that D is a big divisor if h0 (X, OX (nD)) \u2265 \u03b1nd , where d is the dimension\nof X.\nA fibre space is a proper surjective morphism f : V \u2192 W between two varieties\nV and W such that the general fibre is connected. We know the following two\nways to calculate the D-dimension of a variety.\nTheorem 2.7. [Iitaka] Let f : V \u2192 W be a surjective morphism of two varieties\nand let D be a Cartier divisor on W , then we have\n\u03ba(f \u2217 D, V ) = \u03ba(D, W ).\nTheorem 2.8. [Iitaka] Let f : V \u2192 W be a fibre space from a complete nonsingular variety V to a variety W . If D is a divisor on V , then there is an open\ndense subset (in complex topology) U in W such that for every point u \u2208 U\n\u03ba(D, V ) \u2264 \u03ba(Du , Vu ) + dimW,\nwhere Vu = f\n\n\u22121\n\n(u) and Du = D|Vu .\n\nFor the proof of Iitaka's theorems, see [18, Lecture 3] or [39, Chapter II, Section\n5].\nWe will frequently change the coefficients of the effective divisor D or blow up a\nclosed subvariety in D without changing the D-dimension because of the following\ntwo properties [17; 39, Chapter II, Section 5].\nLet f : X \u2032 \u2192 X be a surjective morphism between two complete varieties X \u2032 and\nX, let D be a divisor on X and E an effective divisor on X \u2032 such that codimf (E) \u2265\n2, then\n\u03ba(f \u22121 (D) + E, X \u2032 ) = \u03ba(D, X),\nP\nwhere f \u22121 (D) is the reduced transform of D, defined to be f \u22121 (D) =\nDi , Di 's\nare the irreducible components of D. The second property of D-dimension is\n\n\fHODGE COHOMOLOGY CRITERIA FOR AFFINE VARIETIES\n\n7\n\nthat it does not depend on the coefficients of D under a mild condition which is\ntrue in our case since we always choose effective boundary divisor D with normal\ncrossings. Let D1 , D2 , ***, Dn be any divisor on X such that for every i, 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n,\n\u03ba(Di , X) \u2265 0, then for integers p1 > 0, * * *, pn > 0, we have [20, Section 5]\n\u03ba(D1 + * * * + Dn , X) = \u03ba(p1 D1 + * * * + pn Dn , X).\nIn particular, if Di 's are irreducible components of D and D is effective, then we\ncan change its coefficients and do not change the D-dimension.\nFor a projective manifold M, let L be a line bundle on M, then there is a Cartier\ndivisor D determined by L. We define \u03ba(L, M) = \u03ba(D, M).\nLemma 2.9 (Fujita). Let M and S be two projective manifolds. Let \u03c0 : M \u2192 S\nbe a fibre space and let L and H be line bundles on M and S respectively. Suppose\nthat \u03ba(H, S) = dim S and that \u03ba(aL \u2212 b\u03c0 \u2217 (H)) \u2265 0 for certain positive integers a,\nb. Then \u03ba(L, M) = \u03ba(L|F , F ) + \u03ba(H, S) for a general fibre F of \u03c0.\nLet C(X) be the function field of X. Let\nR(X, D) = \u2295\u03b3\u22650 H 0 (X, OX (\u03b3D))\nbe the graded C-domain and R\u2217 \u2282 R the multiplicative subset of all nonzero\nhomogeneous elements. Then the quotient ring R\u2217\u22121 R is a graded C-domain and\nits degree 0 part (R\u2217\u22121 R)0 is a field denoted by Q((R)), or Q((X, D)), i.e.,\nQ((R)) = Q((X, D)) = (R\u2217\u22121 R)0 .\nThe proof of the following lemma can be found in [26].\nLemma 2.10. Let X be normal proper over an algebraically closed field k. If there\nis an m0 > 0 such that for all m > m0 , h0 (X, OX (mD)) > 0, then\nC(\u03a6|mD| (X)) = Q((X, D)).\nIn particular, if \u03ba(D, X) =dimX, then \u03a6|mD| is birational for all m \u226b 0.\nThere are many versions of Zariski's Main Theorems. The proof of the following\nZariski's Main Theorem can be found in [27, Chapter III, Section 9].\nTheorem 2.11. [Zariski's Main Theorem] Let X be a normal variety over a\nfield k and let f : X \u2032 \u2212\u2192 X be a birational morphism with finite fibre from a\nvariety X \u2032 to X. Then f is an isomorphism of X \u2032 with an open subset U \u2282 X.\nTheorem 2.12. [Neeman] Let X =SpecA be a scheme, U \u2282 X a quasi-compact\nZariski open subset. Then U is affine if and only if H i (U, OU ) = 0 for i \u2265 1.\n3. Proof of the Theorems\nRecall our notation: Y is an open subset of a projective variety X and D is\nthe effective boundary divisor with support X \u2212 Y . We may assume that the\nboundary divisor D has simple normal crossings by further blowing up suitable\nclosed subvariety of X \u2212 Y .\n\n\f8\n\nJING ZHANG\n\nProof of Theorem 1.1. One direction is trivial. If Y is affine, then H i (Y, \u03a9jY ) =\n0 for all j \u2265 0, i > 0 since \u03a9jY is a coherent sheaf [14, Chapter 3, Theorem 3.7];\nthe affineness of Y also implies that D is big since after further blowing up the\nboundary X \u2212 Y , it is the support of an ample divisor [ 15, Chapter 2, Section 6,\nTheorem 6.1]. Therefore \u03ba(D, X) = 3.\nConversely, we need to prove that Y is affine if H i (Y, \u03a9jY ) = 0 for all j \u2265 0, i > 0\nand \u03ba(D, X) = 3. It is sufficient to prove the theorem for normal varieties. The\nreason is the following.\nBy Chevally's theorem [14, Page 222; 15, Chapter 2, Page 63], Y is affine if and\nonly if its normalization Y \u2032 is affine since we have a finite morphism from Y \u2032 to Y .\nBecause a finite morphism is an affine morphism [14, Page 128], Y \u2032 also satisfies\nthe vanishing cohomology H i (Y, \u03a9jY ) = 0 for all j \u2265 0 and i > 0 [14, page 222]. By\nthe definition and property of D-dimension, the new tripple (Y \u2032 , X \u2032 , D \u2032 ) after the\nnormalization also satisfies the hypothesis of Theorem 1.1 [17]. So we may assume\nthat Y is normal.\nWe divide our proof into several steps.\nStep 1. Every principal divisor Z = {f = 0} defined by a nonconstant regular\nfunction f \u2208 H 0 (Y, OY ) satisfies H i (Z, \u03a9jZ ) = 0 for all j \u2265 0, i > 0.\nP roof . For j = 0, 1, 2, the function f gives a short exact sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 \u03a9jY \u2212\u2192 \u03a9jY \u2212\u2192 \u03a9jY |Z \u2212\u2192 0,\nwhere the first map is defined by f. Since H i (Y, \u03a9jY ) = 0 for every i > 0 and j \u2265 0,\nH i (Z, \u03a9jY |Z ) = 0. In particular, H i (Z, OZ ) = 0 for all i > 0. We have an exact\nsequence [14, Chapter 2, Section 8],\n0 \u2212\u2192 A \u2212\u2192 \u03a9jY |Z \u2212\u2192 \u03a9jZ \u2212\u2192 0,\nwhere A is a coherent sheaf on Z. Since Z is not complete, H 2 (Z, A) = 0 [21].\nThus we have H i (Z, \u03a9jZ ) = 0 for all j \u2265 0, i > 0.\nRemark 3.1. If the dimension of Y is higher than 3, in the last exact sequence,\nin general H 2(Z, A) does not vanish. Only when Z is smooth, for all i > 0,\nH i (Z, A) = 0 if dimY >3.\nStep 2. Let Z\u0304 = X0 \u2282 X be a projective surface in X such that Z is an open\nsubset of Z\u0304. Let D0 be the boundary divisor with support Z\u0304 \u2212 Z. If Z is a surface\nwith H i (Z, \u03a9jZ ) = 0 for all j \u2265 0, i > 0 and \u03ba(D0 , X0 ) = 2, then Z is affine.\nP roof. We proved this result in [44]. We include a proof here for completeness.\nBy the same proof of Lemma 1.1 and Lemma 1.4 in [24], we know that Z contains\nno complete curves and the boundary D0 is connected. We will prove that Z is\naffine if it satisfies the following three conditions\n(1) Z contains no complete curves;\n(2) Z\u0304 \u2212 Z is connected;\n(3) \u03ba(D0 , X0 ) = 2.\n\n\fHODGE COHOMOLOGY CRITERIA FOR AFFINE VARIETIES\n\n9\n\nThe idea of proof is to show that the boundary Z\u0304 \u2212 Z is the support of an ample\ndivisor P on Z\u0304.\nAgain we may assume that Z is normal. For a normal surface X, the intersection\ntheory is due to Mumford [28]. For any effective divisor on a complete normal\nsurface, we have Zariski decomposition [34].\nWrite the Zariski decomposition D = P + N, where N is negative definite, P\nis effective and nef and any prime component of N does not intersect P [41, 34].\nWe may assume that both P and N are integral by multiplying a positive integer\nto D. Let SuppD = {D1 , D2 , * * *, Dn } = X \u2212 Y . Since \u03ba(D, X) = 2, P 2 > 0 [3\nCorollary 14.18]. First we claim that SuppP = SuppD = X \u2212 Y .\nIf SuppP 6= X \u2212 Y , then there is a prime component D1 in X \u2212 Y such that\nP * D1 > 0 and D1 is not a component of P since X \u2212 Y is connected. Let\nQ = mP + D1 ,\nwhere m is a big positive integer. Then Q is an effective divisor and SuppQ =\nSuppP \u222a D1 . We may choose m such that\nQ2 = m2 P 2 + 2mP * D1 + D12 > 0.\nFor every prime component E in P , since P is nef and D1 is not contained in\nSuppP , we can choose sufficiently large m such that\nD1 * Q = mD1 * P + D12 > 0.\n\nQ * E = mP * E + D1 * E \u2265 0,\n\nThus we get a new effective divisor Q such that Q is nef and Q2 > 0. We may\nreplace P by Q and still call it P . By finitely many such replacements, we can get\nan effective nef divisor P such that P 2 > 0 and SuppP = SuppD = X \u2212 Y .\nWe claim that the boundary X \u2212 Y is the support of an ample divisor. In\nfact, the following three conditions imply the ampleness: (1) X \u2212 Y is connected;\n(2) Y contains no complete curves; (3) There is an effective nef divisor P with\nsuppP = X \u2212 Y and P 2 > 0.\nIf P is not ample, then there is an irreducible curve C in X such that P * C = 0\nby Nakai-Moizshon's ampleness criterion [14, Chapter V, Theorem 1.10]. Since Y\nhas no complete curves, C must be one of the Di\u2032 s. Rearrange the order, we may\nassume Di * P = 0 for i = 1, 2, ..., r and Dj * P > 0 for j = r + 1, ..., n. Write\nP =\n\nr\nX\ni=1\n\nwhere A =\n\nPr\n\ni=1 ai Di , B =\n\nPn\n\nai Di +\n\nn\nX\n\nbj Dj = A + B,\n\nj=r+1\n\nj=r+1 bj Dj\n\n= A + B. Then for i = 1, ..., r,\n\n0 = P * Di = A * Di + B * Di .\nSince Di is not a component of B for i = 1, ..., r, B * Di \u2265 0. So A * Di \u2264 0 for every\ni = 1, ..., r. Thus the intersection matrix [Ds * Dt ]1\u2264s,t\u2264r is negative semi-definite\n[2]. Since A \u222a B = X \u2212 Y is connected, there is at least one component of A, say,\nDio , such that Dio * B > 0. Hence Dio * A < 0. This implies that the intersection\nmatrix\ns * Dt ]1\u2264s,t\u2264r is negative definite [2]. Therefore there is an effective divisor\nP[D\nr\nE = i=1 \u03b1i Di such that E * Di < 0 for all i = 1, ..., r [2].\n\n\f10\n\nJING ZHANG\n\nSo there are\nP positive numbers \u03b1i , i = 1, ..., r, such that for every i, E * Di < 0,\nwhere E = ri=1 \u03b1i Di . Let P1 = mP \u2212 E, m \u226b 0, then P12 > 0, P1 is nef and if\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 r,\nP1 * Di = \u2212E * Di > 0.\nIf r + 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n, then choose sufficiently large m such that\nP1 * Dj = mP * Dj \u2212 E * Dj > 0.\nThus P1 is an effective ample divisor with support X \u2212 Y . Replace P by P1 , we\nhave shown that X \u2212 Y is the support of an ample divisor P . Therefore Y is an\naffine surface.\nStep 3. An irreducible principal divisor Z = {f = 0, f \u2208 H 0 (Y, OY )} is affine.\nP roof . In Step 1, we showed that H i (Z, \u03a9jZ ) = 0 for all j \u2265 0, i > 0. We\nwill prove \u03ba(D0 , X0 ) = 2 then apply Step 2, where Z\u0304 is the closure of Z is X,\nX0 = Z\u0304 \u2282 X, suppD = Z\u0304 \u2212 Z.\nBy [42], the regular function f determines the following commutative diagram\nY\n\uf8e6 \u0592\u2192\n\uf8e6f |\ny Y\nC \u0592\u2192\n\nX\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6f\ny\nC\u0304\n\nwhere C is a smooth affine curve embedded in a smooth projective curve C\u0304, and f is\nproper and surjective, every fibre of f over C\u0304 is connected, general fibre is smooth.\nAlso general fibre of f |Y is connected and smooth. In particular, Z = {f = 0} is\none fibre in Y . Let Z\u0304 = f \u22121 (0) be the inverse image of 0 in X, then Z = Z\u0304 \u2229 Y .\nLet \u03c0 : X \u2032 \u2192 X be the proper surjective morphism from a smooth projective\nvariety X \u2032 to X with connected fibres (\u03c0 is birational and generically finite), then\nwe have a new fibre space f \u2032 : X \u2032 \u2192 C\u0304 with the same property as the original fibre\nspace f : X \u2192 C\u0304. By [39, Theorem 5.1],\n\u03ba(\u03c0 \u2217 D, X \u2032) = \u03ba(D, X) = 3.\nBy [39, Theorem 5.11], for a general fibre Xt\u2032 = f \u2032\u22121 (t) in X \u2032 , t \u2208 C, we have\n3 \u2264 \u03ba(f \u2032\u2217 D, X \u2032) \u2264 \u03ba(f \u2032\u2217 D|Xt\u2032 , Xt\u2032 ) + 1,\nwhere Xt\u2032 = f \u2032\u22121 (t) is the the general fibre in X \u2032 . So \u03ba(f \u2032\u2217 D|Xt\u2032 , Xt\u2032 ) = 2. Apply\n[39, Theorem 5.13] to the fibre Xt\u2032 , we have\n\u03ba(Dt , Xt ) = \u03ba(f \u2032\u2217 D|Xt\u2032 , Xt\u2032) = 2.\nBy upper semi-continuity theorem [14, Chapter 3, Section 12] or [39, Chapter 1],\n\u03ba(D0 , X0 ) = 2. By Step 2, Z is affine.\nStep 4. For every point y \u2208 Y , there is a principal divisor Z passing through y\nand the closure Z\u0304 of Z in X is connected.\nP roof. The following construction of fibre space is due to Ueno [40, Page 46].\nSince \u03ba(D, X) = 3, let \u03a6|nD| be the rational map from X to PN defined by\n{\u03c60 , \u03c61 , ***, \u03c6N }, a basis of H 0(X, OX (nD)), where N=dim|nD| and dim(im(\u03a6|nD| )) \u2265\n\n\fHODGE COHOMOLOGY CRITERIA FOR AFFINE VARIETIES\n\n11\n\n2.

By the rational map \u03a6|nD| , we can consider that\n\u03b71 and \u03b72 are elements of C(X). By Zariski's lemma [16, Chapter X, Section 13,\nTheorem 1, Page 78], there exists a constant d such that the field C(\u03b71 + d\u03b72 ) is\nalgebraically closed in C(X). Define a rational map f from X to P1 by sending\npoints x in X to (1, \u03b71 (x) + d\u03b72 (x)) in P1 . We can choose \u03b71 and \u03b72 , such that\n\u03b71 + d\u03b72 only has poles in D, that is, when restricted to Y , f is a morphism.

By [42], Sa satisfies\nH i (Sa , \u03a9jSa ) = 0 for all i > 0 and j \u2265 0. So Sa contains no complete curves. Let\nXa = f \u22121 (a), then the boundary Xa \u2212 Sa is connected. By the same argument as\nin the Step 3, we claim that \u03ba(Da , Xa ) = 2, where Da is the effective boundary\ndivisor supported in Xa \u2212 Sa . By Step 2, Sa is affine. Let Z = Sa , we are done.\nStep 5. There is an injective morphism from the associate scheme of Y to\nSpec\u0393(Y, OY ).\nP roof. First let P be a point on the quasi-projective variety Y , then it is a\nclosed point on the associated scheme (we still call it Y ) of Y . Let MP be the\nmaximal ideal of the local ring OP . Let n =dimC MP /MP 2 , then there are n\nregular functions f1 ,..., fn on an open subset containing P such that\nMP = (f1 , ..., fn ).\nSince D is big, we claim that each fi can be extended to a regular function on Y\n(See Step 1, proof of Theorem 1.5). Then these n regular functions give a maximal\nideal of \u0393(Y, OY ).\nFor an irreducible closed subset A of Y , let f1 ,..., fr be the local defining functions\nof A, then we may assume that all of them are regular on Y . So the ideal I =\n(f1 , ..., fn ) is a prime ideal of \u0393(Y, OY ). Naturally we can define a map from Y\nto Spec\u0393(Y, OY ) by sending a closed point to the corresponding maximal ideal in\n\u0393(Y, OY ) and a nonclosed point on the scheme Y to the associated prime ideal in\n\u0393(Y, OY ). Let g be the morphism defined by this map. We will prove its injectivity.\n\n\f12\n\nJING ZHANG\n\ng is injective if and only if for any two distinct points y1 and y2 in Y , there\nis a regular function f on Y separating these two points, i.e., f (y1 ) 6= f (y2 ). To\nsee this, let A and B be two distinct irreducible closed subsets of Y (as a quasiprojective variety). There is a point p in one of them, say A, such that p in not\na point of B. Then there is a regular function f on Y such that f (y1) = 0 but\nf (y2 ) = 1. Therefore f is one of the defining functions of A but not B. Write the\nprime ideals defining A and B as follows\ng(A) = (f, f1 , ...fm ),\n\ng(B) = (g1 , ..., gn ).\n\nThen f 6\u2208 g(B). So the images g(A) 6= g(B). This shows the injectivity of g.\nLet y1 and y2 be two distinct points in Y and consider their images in the fibre\nspace constructed in Step 4\nY\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6 \u0592\u2192 X\n\uf8e6f\n\uf8e6f |\ny\ny Y\nC \u0592\u2192 P1 .\nIf f (y1 ) 6= f (y2 ), then g(y1 ) 6= g(y2). Assume f (y1) = f (y2 ) = a \u2208 C = f (Y ) \u2282 C.\nSince Sa = f \u22121 (a) \u2229 Y is affine, there is a regular function r on Sa such that\nr(y1 ) 6= r(y2).\nFrom the short exact sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 OY \u2212\u2192 OY \u2212\u2192 OSa \u2212\u2192 0,\nwhere the first map is defined by f \u2212 a, we have surjective map from H 0 (Y, OY )\nto H 0 (Z, OZ ) since H 1 (Y, OY ) = 0. Lift r to a regular function R on Y , we find a\nfunction separating y1 and y2 . So g is injective.\nRemark 3.2. We may use the following alternating construction of the morphism\ng from Y to Spec\u0393(Y, OY ) as follows.\nSince \u03ba(D, X) = 3, we have a dominant morphism h from Y to AdC defined\nby three algebraically independent nonconstant functions on Y . Let Z be the\nnormalization of A3 in Y , then we have a morphism g from Y to Z =Spec\u0393(Y, OY )\nand g is birational since Y and Z have the same function field.\nStep 6. Y is affine.\nP roof. The above morphism g is birational since Y and Spec\u0393(Y, OY ) have the\nsame function field. By Zariski's Main Theorem [27, Chapter 3, Section 9], g is an\nopen immersion from Y to Spec\u0393(Y, OY ). By Neeman's theorem [29], Y is affine\nsince H i (Y, OY ) = 0 for all i > 0. In fact, as a scheme, Y =Spec\u0393(Y, OY ) since\nthey have the same coordinate ring.\nQ.E.D.\nProof of Theorem 1.4. If Y is an affine variety with dimension d, then it\nsatisfies the following four conditions [15, Chapter 2, Section 1, 3, 6]:\n(1) Y satisfied condition A;\n(2) \u03ba(D, X) \u2265 1;\n(3) H i (Y, OY ) = 0 for all i > 0.\n\n\fHODGE COHOMOLOGY CRITERIA FOR AFFINE VARIETIES\n\n13\n\nSuppose now that the quasi-projective variety Y satisfies the above three conditions, we will prove that it is affine. We will use the induction on the dimension\nof Y . If Y is a curve, it is trivial [15, Chapter 2, Section 4, Proposition 4.1]. If Y\nis a surface, the proof is the same as in the proof of Theorem 1.1, Step 2. Assume\nthat the claim holds for every d \u2212 1 dimensional variety. Let dimY = d. We may\nassume that Y is normal [14, Page 128, Page 222].\nStep 1. \u03ba(D, X) = d.\nP roof. Since \u03ba(D, X) \u2265 1, we can construct a fibre space f : X \u2192 C\u0304, where C\u0304\nis a smooth projective curve. We also have the following commutative diagram\nY\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6 \u0592\u2192 X\n\uf8e6f\n\uf8e6f |\ny\ny Y\nC \u0592\u2192 C\u0304,\nwhere C = f (Y ) is a smooth affine curve, f is proper and surjective, every fibre of\nf over C is connected.\nWe will compute the D-dimension of X by Fujita's formula. For the condition\nin Fujita's formula, see the proof of Theorem 1.6.\nLet \u03c0 : X \u2032 \u2192 X be a proper surjective morphism such that X \u2032 is a smooth projective variety and every fibre is connected. In fact, \u03c0 is birational and generically\nfinite. Then we have [39, Chapter II, Theorem 5.13]\n\u03ba(\u03c0 \u2217 D, X \u2032) = \u03ba(D, X).\nConsider a general fibre Yt = f \u22121 (t) \u2229 Y , t \u2208 C \u2282 C\u0304. By condition A, Yt is affine.\nLet Xt = f \u22121 (t) and Dt be an effective boundary divisor with support Xt \u2212 Yt ,\nthen \u03ba(Dt , Xt ) = d \u2212 1. Pull this divisor Dt back to Xt\u2032 = \u03c0 \u22121 (Xt ), we have [39,\nChapter II, Theorem 5.13]\n\u03ba(\u03c0 \u2217 Dt , Xt\u2032 ) = \u03ba(Dt , Xt ) = d \u2212 1.\nConsider the new fibre space X \u2032 \u2192 C\u0304, by Fujita's formula we have\n\u03ba(\u03c0 \u2217 D, X \u2032 ) = \u03ba(\u03c0 \u2217 Dt , Xt\u2032 ) + 1 = d.\nTherefore \u03ba(D, X) = d.\nStep 2. For any point y in Y , there is a principal divisor Z passing through y.\nP roof . We may assume d \u2265 2. Consider Ueno's fibre space [39, Page 46] in\nStep 4, proof of Theorem 1.1\nY\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6 \u0592\u2192 X\n\uf8e6f\n\uf8e6f |\ny\ny Y\nC \u0592\u2192 P1 .\nWe know that every fibre of f is connected. Let f (y) = a, then a \u2208 f \u22121 (a) = Xt .\nLet Z = Yt = Xt \u2229 Y , then Z = {f \u2212 a = 0, f \u2208 H 0 (Y, OY )} is a principal divisor\npassing through y.\nBy condition A, Z is affine.\nStep 3. Y contains no complete curves.\n\n\f14\n\nJING ZHANG\n\nP roof . If Y has a complete curve F , we may assume that it is connected. Let\np \u2208 F be a point on F . Let f (p) = a, where f is the morphism in Step 1. Then a\nis a point on C = f (Y ). Let Xa = f \u22121 (a), Ya = Xa \u2229 Y , then p is a point on the\nopen fibre Ya . Since F is connected and Xa is also connected, F \u2282 Ya . But Ya is a\nclosed subvariety of Y , so Ya is affine by condition A. This is a contradiction since\nan affine variety does not have any complete curve. Thus Y contains no complete\ncurves.\nStep 4. There is an injective morphism g from Y to Spec\u0393(Y, OY ).\nP roof . We again define the morphism from Y to Spec\u0393(Y, OY ) as in the Step\n5, proof of Theorem 1.1. We send a closed irreducible subvariety on Y (as a quasiprojective variety) to its defining prime ideal. We know this morphism g is injective\nif and only if for any two distinct points y1 and y2 on Y , there is a regular function\nH on Y such that H(y1) 6= H(y2 ). Let Z be the principal divisor in Step 2 passing\nthough y1 and f \u2208 \u0393(Y, OY ) be its defining function. If f (y2 ) 6= f (y1 ), then we are\ndone. Suppose f (y2) = f (y1 ) = 0. From the exact sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 OY \u2212\u2192 OY \u2212\u2192 OZ \u2212\u2192 0,\nwe can lift any regular function from Z to Y . In particular, we can choose\nh \u2208 \u0393(Z, OZ ) such that h(y1 ) = 0 but h(y2 ) = 1. Thus there is a regular function\nH on Y such that H(y1) 6= H(y2 ).\nStep 5. Y is affine.\nP roof . By Zariski's Main Theorem, Y is isomorphic to an open subset of\nSpec\u0393(Y, OY ). By Neeman's theorem, Y is affine.\nQ.E.D.\nProof of Theorem 1.5. If Y is affine, then H i (Y, \u03a9jY ) = 0 for all j \u2265 0, i > 0\nand \u03ba(D, X) = n [15, Chapter 2, Theorem 1.1, Theorem 6.1]. Let Y be a smooth\nquasi-projective variety with H i (Y, \u03a9jY ) = 0 for all j \u2265 0, i > 0 and \u03ba(D, X) = d,\nwe need to prove that it is affine. We will use the induction on the dimension of\nY.\nThe claim holds for curves [15, Chapter 2, proposition 4.1] and surfaces by the\nproof of Theorem 1.1, Step 2. Assume that the claim holds for d\u22121 > 0 dimensional\nsmooth varieties. Let dimY = d.\nStep 1. We first claim that for any point y in Y , there is a smooth prime\nprincipal divisor Z = {f = 0, f \u2208 H 0 (Y, OY )} passing through y.\nP roof. Since \u03ba(D, X) =dimX = d > 0, there is a > 0 such that for all m \u226b\n0, h0 (X, OX (mD)) \u2265 amd [39, Theorem 8.1]. Recall our notation in Section 2.\nChoose a basis {f0 , f1 , * * *, fn } of the linear space H 0 (X, OX (mD)), it defines a\nrational map \u03a6|mD| from X to the projective space Pn by sending a point x on X\nto (f0 (x), f1 (x), * * *, fn (x)) in Pn . By definition of D-dimension,\n\u03ba(D, X) = max{dim(\u03a6|mD| (X))} = d.\nm\n\n\fHODGE COHOMOLOGY CRITERIA FOR AFFINE VARIETIES\n\n15\n\nLet C(X) be the function field of X. Let\nR(X, D) = \u2295\u03b3\u22650 H 0 (X, OX (\u03b3D))\nbe the graded C-domain and R\u2217 \u2282 R the multiplicative subset of all nonzero\nhomogeneous elements. Then the quotient ring R\u2217\u22121 R is a graded C-domain and\nits degree 0 part (R\u2217\u22121 R)0 is a field denoted by Q((R)), or Q((X, D)), i.e.,\nQ((R)) = Q((X, D)) = (R\u2217\u22121 R)0 .\nIt is easy to see that Q((X, D)) = Q((X, aD)) and \u03ba(D, X) = \u03ba(aD, X) for all\npositive integer a. Notice that the quotient field Q(R) of R is different from Q((R)).\nBy [26, Proposition 1.4], the function field of the image \u03a6|mD| (X) is Q((X, D)),\ni.e., C(\u03a6|mD| (X)) = Q((X, D)). By [26, Proposition 1.9], \u03a6|mD| is birational for\nall m \u226b 0 since D is effective and \u03ba(X, D) =dimX. So the two function fields\nC(\u03a6|mD| (X)) and C(X) are isomorphic\nC(\u03a6|mD| (X)) = C(X).\nTherefore\nC(X) = Q((X, D)).\nThis implies that any rational function r on X can be written as a quotient f /g\nof two regular functions f and g on Y with g 6= 0, where there is some m > 0 such\nthat f, g \u2208 H 0 (X, OX (mD)). If r is regular on an open subset U in Y , then r = 0\non a closed subset A of U gives f = 0 on A.\nFor any point y on Y , there is a smooth prime divisor Z passing through y.\nSince Y is smooth, it is locally factorial. Let r be the local defining function of Z\nnear y, then there is a regular function f on Y such that f also defines Z near y.\nWe define the smooth prime divisor Z = {f = 0}.\nStep 2. The above smooth principal divisor Z satisfies the same vanishing\ncondition H i (Z, \u03a9jZ ) = 0 for all i > 0 and j \u2265 0. Moreover, Z is affine.\nP roof . Let f be the defining function of Z, then\n0 \u2212\u2192 \u03a9jY \u2212\u2192 \u03a9jY \u2212\u2192 \u03a9jY |Z \u2212\u2192 0,\nwhere the first map is defined by f . So H i (Z, \u03a9jY |Z ) = 0 since H i (Y, \u03a9jY ) = 0 for\nall j \u2265 0, i > 0. In particular, H i (Z, OZ ) = 0 for all i > 0. Since both Y and Z\nare smooth, We have an exact sequence [14, Chapter 2, Section 8; 12, Page 157],\n0 \u2212\u2192 \u03a9Zj\u22121 \u2212\u2192 \u03a9jY |Z \u2212\u2192 \u03a9jZ \u2212\u2192 0.\nSo H i (Z, \u03a9jZ ) = 0 for all j \u2265 0, i > 0.\nBy Theorem 5.11 and Theorem 5.13, [39]\nd = \u03ba(D, X) \u2264 \u03ba(Dt , Xt ) + 1,\nwhere Xt = f \u22121 (t) is a general fibre and Dt is the boundary divisor on Xt supported\nin Xt \u2212 Y for t \u2208 C \u2282 C. So \u03ba(Dt , Xt ) = d \u2212 1. Let Z\u0304 = X0 be the completion\nof Z in X, let D0 be the effective boundary divisor supported in X0 \u2212 Y , then by\nGrauert's upper semi-continuity theorem [39, Chapter 1], \u03ba(D0 , Z\u0304) = d \u2212 1.\n\n\f16\n\nJING ZHANG\n\nBy the inductive assumption, Z is affine.\nStep 3. Y is affine.\nP roof . We construct the morphism g from Y to Spec\u0393(Y, OY ) as in Step 5,\nproof of Theorem 1.1. g is birational since Y and Spec\u0393(Y, OY ) have the same\nfunction field. It is also injective. In fact, for any two distinct points y1 and y2\non Y there is a regular function R on Y such that R(y1 ) 6= R(y2 ). This is the\nconsequence of the affineness of the smooth principal divisor Z = {f = 0} passing\nthrough y1 . More precisely, if y2 \u2208\n/ Z, then f (y1 ) 6= f (y2), we are done. Assume\ny2 \u2208 Z, i.e., f (y1) = f (y2) = 0. By the affineness of Z and the short exact sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 OY \u2212\u2192 OY \u2212\u2192 OZ \u2212\u2192 0,\nwe can lift a regular function r from Z to Y , where r(y1 ) 6= r(y2 ). So if R is the\nlifting, then R(y1 ) 6= R(y2 ). This proves the injectivity of g. By Zariski's Main\nTheorem and Neeman's theorem, Y is affine.\nQ.E.D.\nProof of Theorem 1.6. We will prove that \u03ba(D, X) =dimX = n then apply\nTheorem 1.5.\nLet f : Y \u2212\u2192 C be the surjective morphism from Y to the smooth affine curve\nC. Then f gives a rational map from X to the completion C\u0304 of C. Resolve the\nindeterminacy of f on the boundary X \u2212 Y . We may replace X by its suitable\nblowing up and assume that f : X \u2192 C\u0304 is surjective and proper morphism.\nNotice that this procedure does not change Y . Y is still an open subset of X.\nBy Stein factorization, we may assume that every fibre is connected and general\nfibre is smooth. Pick a point t1 \u2208 C\u0304 \u2212 C, then \u03ba(t1 , C\u0304) = 1. For a general point\nt \u2208 C, by the Riemann-Roch formula, there is a positive integer m, such that\nh0 (C\u0304, O(mt1 \u2212 t)) > 1. Let s be a nonconstant section of H 0 (C\u0304, O(mt1 \u2212 t)), then\ndivs + mt1 \u2212 t \u2265 0.\nPull it back to X, we have\nf \u2217 (divs + mt1 \u2212 t) = divf \u2217 (s) + mf \u2217 (t1 ) \u2212 f \u2217 (t) \u2265 0.\nLet D1 = f \u2217 (t1 ) and F = f \u2217 (t), then h0 (X, OX (mD1 \u2212 F )) > 0. Choose an\neffective divisor D with support X \u2212 Y such that D1 \u2264 D, then we have\nh0 (X, OX (mD \u2212 F )) \u2265 h0 (X, OX (mD1 \u2212 F )) > 0.\nSince F |Y is a smooth affine subvariety of codimension 1 [15, Chapter 2, Proposition\n4.1], \u03ba(D|F , F ) = n \u2212 1. By Fujita's equality,\n\u03ba(D, X) = \u03ba(mD, X) = \u03ba(mD|F , F ) + \u03ba(t1 , C\u0304) = n.\nBy Theorem 1.5, Y is affine.\nQ.E.D.\nIt is easy to see that Theorem 1.7 follows from Theorem 1.6.\n\n\fHODGE COHOMOLOGY CRITERIA FOR AFFINE VARIETIES\n\n17\n\nRemark 3.3.
