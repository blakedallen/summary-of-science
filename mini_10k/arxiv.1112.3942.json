The absorption of photons by a solidstate crystal gives rise to quasiparticles called excitons.\nThere are two limiting models of excitons: Wannier-Mott\nexcitons and Frenkel excitons. Wannier-Mott excitons\noccur in crystals with band structure leading to collective\nexcitations with an effective radius much greater than\nthe lattice constant, while Frenkel excitons are typical for\nmolecular crystals, where collective excitations are superpositions of elementary excitations localized on different\nlattice sites. These properties lead to important differences in non-linear exciton interactions for the two models. The interactions between the Wannier-Mott excitons\nare determined by the Coulomb interaction and the phase\nspace filling [1], while the interactions of Frenkel excitons\nare determined by shorter range dynamical couplings [2].\nMultiple experiments demonstrated that Wannier-Mott\nexcitons can form two-exciton bound states called biexcitons [3\u20135]. By contrast, despite many theoretical studies [6\u20139], Frenkel biexcitons have eluded the experimental observation, with one notable exception [10]. In the\npresent work, we show that rotational excitation of ultracold molecules trapped on an optical lattice gives rise\nto Frenkel excitons with controllable non-linear interactions. We demonstrate that the exciton\u2013exciton interactions can be tuned to induce the formation of Frenkel\nbiexciton and that the biexciton binding energy can be\ncontrolled by an external electric field.\n\nWe use the rotational states of molecules as a probe of\nthe collective interactions, i.e. the experiments proposed\nhere can be carried out by measuring site-selective populations of the rotational states. This can be achieved by\napplying a gradient of an electric field and detecting resonant transitions from Stark-shifted levels, as described\nin Ref. [22].\nExciton\u2013exciton interactions in an optical lattice. We\nconsider an ensemble of polar diatomic molecules in the\n1\n\u03a3 electronic state trapped on an optical lattice in the\nro-vibrational ground state. The rotational states of the\nmolecules |N MN i are described by the rotational angular\nmomentum N\u0302 and its projection on the quantization axis\nMN . We assume that the molecules are in the Mottinsulator phase [11] and that each lattice site contains\nonly one molecule. We consider the rotational excitation\n|N = 0, MN = 0i \u2192 |N = 1, MN = 0i of molecules in the\nlattice [23]. For simplicity, we denote the ground state\nof the molecule in site n by |gn i and the excited state by\n|en i. Because the molecules are coupled by the dipoledipole interaction, the rotational excitation gives rise to\na rotational Frenkel exciton [13], which is an eigenstate\nof the Hamiltonian:\n\nSeveral experiments have recently demonstrated that\nultracold molecules can be trapped in a periodic potential\nof an optical lattice [11]. Such systems can be used for\nthe study of quantum energy transfer [12, 13], non-linear\nphoton\u2013photon interactions [14], novel quantum memory\ndevices [15] and, most notably, for quantum simulation of\nlattice models [16\u201321]. Although describing different phenomena, the Hamiltonians presented in these references,\nand in the present work, can be cast in the same form.\nFor example, the exciton Hamiltonian discussed here can\nbe mapped onto the t-V model, which is the special case\nof the Heisenberg-like models studied in the context of\nultracold molecules in Refs. [17, 21]. The key difference\nof the present work from those in Refs. [17, 21] is that we\nexplore phenomena associated with the excitation spectrum of the many-body system in the limit of a small\nnumber of excitations. Because we consider a simpler\nHamiltonian, our scheme is conceptually simpler, requiring fewer molecular states and external field parameters.\n\nwhere J(n \u2212 m) = hen , gm |V\u0302dd (n \u2212 m)|gn , em i with\nV\u0302dd (n\u2212m) representing dipole-dipole interaction between\nmolecules in sites n and m, E0 is the energy difference\nbetween the states |gi and |ei, and the operators P\u0302n\u2020 and\nP\u0302n are defined by the relations P\u0302n\u2020 |gm i = \u03b4nm |en i and\nP\u0302n |em i = \u03b4nm |gn i. The P\u0302n and P\u0302m operators satisfy\nthe bosonic commutation, if n 6= m, and the fermionic\ncommutation, if n = m [2].\nMultiple excitations lead to dynamical exciton\u2013exciton\ninteractions described by [2]:\n\n\u0124exc = E0\n\nN\nmol\nX\n\nP\u0302n\u2020 P\u0302n +\n\nn=1\n\n\u0124dyn\n\nN\nmol\nX\n\nJ(n \u2212 m)P\u0302n\u2020 P\u0302m ,\n\n(1)\n\nn,m6=n\n\nNmol\n1 X\n\u2020\n=\nD(n \u2212 m)P\u0302n\u2020 P\u0302m\nP\u0302n P\u0302m\n2\n\n(2)\n\nn,m6=n\n\nwhere D(n \u2212 m) = hen , em |V\u0302dd (n \u2212 m)|en , em i +\nhgn , gm |V\u0302dd (n\u2212m)|gn , gm i\u22122hen , gm |V\u0302dd (n\u2212m)|en , gm i.\nThe dipole - dipole interaction operator V\u0302dd (n \u2212 m) can\nonly couple states of different parity [24].

The exciton\u2013exciton interactions generally\nhave little effect on the energy spectrum of two-particle\ncontinuum states E(k1 ) + E(k2 ). However, under certain conditions discussed below, non-linear interactions\nmay result in the formation of a bound two-exciton complex, biexciton. The biexciton state is split from the\ntwo-particle continuum. The splitting is the biexciton\nbinding energy.\nRef. [6] shows that biexcitons can generally form in\n1D and 2D crystals if\n|D| \u2265 2|J|\n\n(4)\n\nwhere D and J are the coupling constants D(n \u2212 m)\nand J(n \u2212 m) for n \u2212 m = 1. In 3D crystals, biexcitons can form if |D| > 6|J| [9]. For 1D crystals, the\nbiexciton energy in the nearest neighbor approximation\n2\n2\n(NNA) is Eb (K) = 2E0 + D + 4J cosD(aK/2) , where K is\nthe total wave vector of two interacting excitons and a is\nthe lattice constant, and the biexciton binding energy is\n\u2206 = (D \u2212 2J)2 /D. The maximum number of exciton\u2013\nexciton bound states is equal to the dimensionality of the\ncrystal, i.e. one biexciton state for 1D, two for 2D and\nthree for 3D [6, 25].\nFor molecules in an optical lattice, the magnitudes of\nJ and D depend on the strength of the applied electric\nfield and the angle between the field and the molecular array (\u03b8) (see Figure 1c). We calculate these parameters for a 1D array of 1 \u03a3 polar molecules (such as\nalkali metal dimers produced in ultracold molecule experiments) trapped on an optical lattice with the lattice\n\n0.6\n\nEnergy (units of Vdd )\n\n0.5\n\n(a)\n\n\u03b8 =90 o\n\n\u03b8\n\n0.4\n\nD\n\n0.3\n0.2\n\n\u03b5f\n\nJ\n\n0.1\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n\u03b5 f d / Be\n\n8\n\n10\n40\n\n6\n\n(b)\nEnergy (kHz)\n\n5\n4\n\nD/J\n\nare states of well-defined parity, such as the rotational\nstates |N MN i, the matrix elements D(n \u2212 m) must be\nzero.\nThe inversion symmetry (parity) of molecules on an\noptical lattice can be broken by applying an external dc\nelectric field. In an electric field, |gn i and |en i are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian \u0124nmol = Be N\u0302n2 \u2212 dn * Ef , where\ndn is the dipole moment of molecule in site n and Ef\nis the P\nelectric field vector. They can\nP be expressed as\n|gi = N aN |N MN = 0i and |ei = N bN |N MN = 0i,\nwhere aN and bN are determined by the electric field\nstrength.\nThe Hamiltonian (1) can be diagonalized by the\nP ikn \u2020\nFourier transforms: P\u0302 \u2020 (k) = \u221aN1\ne P\u0302n and\nmol\nn\nP\nP\u0302 (k) = \u221aN1\ne\u2212ikn P\u0302n , where k is the wave vector\n\n3\n2\n\n20\n0\n\n-40\n-60\n\n0\n\n-80\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n\u03b5 f d / Be\n\n8\n\n10\n\nm eff > 0\n\n-20\n\n1\n0\n\n(c)\n\nJ\n\nm eff < 0\nD\n\u03b8*\n\n10\n\n30\n\n50\n\n70\n\n90\n\n\u03b8 (degree)\n\nFIG. 1.

For LiCs\nmolecules possessing the dipole moment d=5.529 Debye, the\nvalue Ef d/Be = 1 corresponds to Ef = 2.12 kV/cm. (c)\nSchematic depiction of the angle \u03b8 between the field (represented by blue arrows) and the molecular array (represented\nby red dots). (d) D and J for a 1D array of LiCs molecules\nseparated by 400 nm as functions of \u03b8 for Ef = 6 kV/cm.\n\nseparation a = 400 nm. Figure 1b shows that for a fixed\nangle \u03b8 the ratio D/J increases as the electric field magnitude increases. For LiCs molecules, the condition (4)\nis satisfied for electric fields > 3.6 kV/cm. Note that the\nratio D/J is independent of \u03b8.\nFrenkel excitons are quasiparticles characterized by an\neffective mass (meff ). The sign of J determines the sign\nof the effective mass [13]: negative J corresponds to positive meff and vice versa (see Figure 1d). Due to the\nlinearity of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, a positive potential is attractive for particles with negative mass, just\nlike a negative potential is attractive for particles with\npositive mass. Because the sign of J and D is the same\n(and consequently the signs of D and meff are opposite),\nthe dynamical interaction (2) between excitons in this\nsystem is attractive.\nTo demonstrate the formation of the biexciton and calculate the biexciton energy, we diagonalize the Hamiltonian \u0124exc + \u0124dyn for a one-dimensional array of Nmol =\n501 LiCs molecules. The matrix of the Hamiltonian is\nevaluated by expanding the biexciton states as\nX\n|\u03a8b (K)i =\nCkK |P\u0302 \u2020 (K/2 + k)P\u0302 \u2020 (K/2 \u2212 k)i, (5)\nk\u22650\n\nwhere K = k1 + k2 and k = (k1 \u2212 k2 )/2, and k1 and k2\ndenote the wavevectors of the interacting excitons.

The binding\nenergy of the biexciton changes sign at \u03b8 = \u03b8\u2217 . It is\ninstructive to analyze the biexciton wave function in the\nsite representation, which can be obtained analytically\nusing NNA:\nX\n\u2020\n|\u03a8b (K)i =\ni,\neiK(n+m)/2 \u03c8(|n \u2212 m|)|P\u0302n\u2020 P\u0302m\nn,m6=n\n\np\n\u0012\n\u0013|r|\u22121\nD2 \u2212 4J 2 cos2 (Ka/2) 2J cos(Ka/2)\n\u221a\n\u03c8K (r) =\n,\nD\n2D Nmol\nwhere r = n \u2212 m. The biexciton wave function \u03c8K (r) is\nplotted in Figure 2d. Figures 1 and 2 thus illustrate that\nthe biexciton binding energy and size can be tuned by\nvarying the strength and orientation of the electric field.\nNon-optical creation of biexcitons. We now explain\nwhy it is difficult to observe Frenkel biexcitons in solidstate molecular crystals. First, many molecular crystals, such as anthracene or naphthalene, possess inversion\nsymmetry. In these crystals, the constant D as defined in\nthe line after Eq.(2) must vanish and Eq.(4) is not satisfied. Second, it is difficult to excite biexciton states optically: it was shown in Ref.[7] that the oscillator strength\n\nfor the photon-induced transitions to the biexciton state\nmust decrease with the increasing binding energy of the\nbiexcitons. Therefore, two-photon excitation can only\nproduce unstable weakly bound biexcitons. Third, excitons in molecular crystals decay via bimolecular annihilation processes into higher-energy states and subsequent relaxation accompanied by emission of phonons.\nThis process is prohibited by conservation of energy in\nan optical lattice with diatomic molecules. Figure 1\ndemonstrates that the first obstacle can be removed by\ntuning the electric field. To overcome the second obstacle, we propose a non-optical method of populating\ndeeply bound biexciton states based on the unique structure of 1 \u03a3 polar molecules. As zero electric field the\nrotational states |gi and |ei are separated by the energy\n\u2206\u000fe\u2212g = 2Be , while the energy separation between state\n|ei and the next rotationally excited state |f i \u2261 |N =\n2, MN = 0i is equal to \u2206\u000fe\u2212f = 4Be . As the electric\nfield increases, \u2206\u000fe\u2212g increases faster than \u2206\u000fe\u2212f . When\nEf d/Be ' 3.24 (corresponding to Ef ' 6.88 kV/cm for\nLiCs), \u2206\u000ff \u2212g = 2\u2206\u000fe\u2212g . At electric fields near this magnitude, two |gi \u2192 |ei excitons can undergo the transition to the |f i state, and, inversely, the |gi \u2192 |f i excitation can produce a pair of |gi \u2192 |ei excitons or a\nbiexciton state depicted in Figure\nP2. The coupling\u2020 be\u2020\n,\ntween states |ei and |f i is \u012412 =\nM (n\u2212m)R\u0302n P\u0302n P\u0302m\nn6=m\n\nwhere M (n \u2212 m) = hen , em |Vdd (n \u2212 m)|fn , gm i, and\nthe operator R\u0302n annihilates the |f i excitation in lattice site n. The total Hamiltonian describing this threelevel system is \u0124g\u2212e\u2212f = \u0124exc + \u0124dyn + \u01242 + \u012412 ,\nP\nP \u2020\nJg\u2212f (n \u2212 m)R\u0302n\u2020 R\u0302m and\nwhere \u01242 = Ef\nR\u0302n R\u0302n +\nn\n\nn,m6=n\n\nJg\u2212f (n \u2212 m) = hgn , fm |Vdd (n \u2212 m)|fn , gm i.\nIn order to calculate the probability of the population\ntransfer from state f to the biexciton state, we solve the\ntime-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation with the Hamiltonian \u0124g\u2212e\u2212f evaluated in the basis of products of the\neigenstates of \u0124exc +\u0124dyn and the eigenstates of \u01242 . This\nleads to coupled differential equations, which we solve numerically. Note that the magnitude of Jg\u2212f is about ten\ntimes smaller than J. In the absence of decoherence, the\n|gi \u2192 |f i excitation gives rise to the Frenkel exciton and\nthe transition from the f states to the biexciton state\nis a coherent exciton\u2013exciton transition. In the presence\nof decoherence, the exciton states become localized. If\nthe decoherence rate is larger than Jg\u2212f /h, but smaller\nthan J/h, the |gi \u2192 |f i excitation is localized, while\nthe biexciton states remain coherent. Figure 3 presents\nthe calculations of the population transfer probabilities\nfor both scenarios. The results show that the biexciton\nstates can be populated with high efficiency. The equilibrium populations (in the limit of large t) depend on\nthe relative energies of the f state, the biexciton bound\nstate and exciton\u2013exciton continuum states, which can\nbe tuned by varying the electric field magnitude. The\nefficiency of the population transfer can be maximized\nif the electric field is detuned far away from resonance\n\n\fEnergy (kHz)\n\n4\n20\n0\n\nf\n\u03a8b\n\n-20\n-40\n-60\n-80\n-2\n\nPopulation\n\n1\n0.8\n\n2\n\n0\n\nKa\n\nplane wave\n\n87%\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n50\n\n0\n\nPopulation\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n\n100\n\nTime (\u03bcs)\n\n200\n\n150\n\nlocal\n\n60%\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\nTime (\u03bcs)\n\n150\n\n200\n\nFIG. 3. (Color online) Population dynamics for the transition\nfrom |gi \u2192 |f i exciton (middle panel) and from an f state\nlocalized on a single molecule (lower panel) to coherent |gi \u2192\n|ei excitons and biexcitons. The green dashed curves denote\nthe population accumulated in the pairs of non-bound |gi \u2192\n|ei exciton states, the red solid curves the biexciton state and\nthe blue dot-dashed curves the f state. The shaded region\nin the upper panel encapsulates the band of the continuum\ntwo-exciton states. The calculation is for a 1D ensemble of\nNmol = 501 LiCs molecules on an optical lattice with lattice\nseparation a = 400 nm. The electric field of magnitude 6.88\nkV/cm is perpendicular to the molecular array.\n\nwhen the biexciton population oscillations reach the first\nmaximum. Detuning the electric field to low magnitudes\neffectively decouples the f state from the states in the\n{g, e} subspace and interrupts the population dynamics.\nThis corresponds to switching off the channel for bimolecular annihilation of excitons, which is one of the reasons\nof the biexciton population depletion in solids. We have\nconfirmed that the calculations with electric fields < 5.0\nkV/cm yield no noticeable population transfer.\nDiscussion. We have shown that rotational excitation\nof molecules trapped on an optical lattice gives rise to\nrotational excitons whose interactions can be controlled\n\n[1] J. R. Kuklinski, S. Mukamel, Phys.

The exciton\u2013exciton interactions can be tuned to produce two-exciton bound states.\nA biexciton is an entangled state of two Frenkel excitons.\nThe creation of biexcitons as described in the previous\nsection and tuning the electric field to the regime of zero\nbinding energy can thus be used for the controlled preparation of entangled pairs of non-interacting excitons. In\norder to observe the biexcitons, one could measure correlations between the populations of the rotationally excited states of molecules in different lattice sites using\nthe method proposed in Ref. [22].\nThe present work suggests several interesting questions. For example, it was recently shown that Frenkel\nexcitons in shallow optical lattices can be coupled to lattice phonons, leading to polarons [26]. Coupling a Frenkel\nbiexciton to phonons would produce strongly interacting\npolarons. It would be interesting to explore if these interactions lead to the formation of bipolarons.\nWe have repeated the calculations presented here for a\nsystem of three excitons and similarly observed the formation of three-exciton bound states. It would be interesting to explore the effect of tunable exciton\u2013exciton\ninteractions on excitation correlations, both as a function\nof D/J and the density of excitations, to understand fundamental limits of exciton clustering [27].\nThe creation of biexcitons with tunable binding energy\nand measuring quantum energy transport for different\nratios D/J can be used to study the effects of exciton\u2013\nexciton entanglement on energy transfer in molecular aggregates [28\u201330]. The ability to tune exciton\u2013exciton interactions can be used to explore the role of multiple\nexcitation correlations on energy transfer in disordered\nsystems (the confining lattice potential can be tilted or\nthe molecules can be perturbed by a disorder potential\nproduced by an inhomogeneous electric field).\nAcknowledgment.
