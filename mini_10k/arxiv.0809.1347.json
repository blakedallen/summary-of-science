We exhibit a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism of a surface S which acts trivially on\nH1 (S; Z) and whose flux is nonzero.\n\n1. I NTRODUCTION\nLet S be a compact oriented surface with nonempty boundary, \u03c9 be an area form on S, and h be\nan area-preserving diffeomorphism of (S, \u03c9). Consider the mapping torus \u03a3(S, h) of (S, h), which\nwe define as (S \u00d7 [0, 1])/(x, 1) \u223c (h(x), 0). Here (x, t) are coordinates on S \u00d7 [0, 1]. If there is a\ncontact form \u03b1 on \u03a3(S, h) for which d\u03b1|S\u00d7{0} = \u03c9 and the corresponding Reeb vector field R\u03b1 is\ndirected by \u2202t , then we say h is the first return map of R\u03b1 . In this note we investigate the following\nquestion:\nQuestion 1.1. What is the difference between an area-preserving diffeomorphism h of a surface\n(S, \u03c9) and the first return map of a Reeb flow R\u03b1 , defined on \u03a3(S, \u03c9)?\nOne easily computes that the first return map of R\u03b1 is \u03c9-area-preserving (cf. Lemma 2.1). Question 1.1 can then be rephrased as follows:\nQuestion 1.2. Can every area-preserving h be expressed as the first return map of a Reeb flow\nR\u03b1 ?\nWe emphasize that we are interested in the rigid problem of realizing a given diffeomorphism\nh, instead of its realization up to isotopy. This question is of particular importance when one tries\nto compute the contact homology of a contact structure adapted to an open book decomposition\n[CH2]. The periodic orbits of an adapted Reeb flow that are away from the binding of the open\nbook correspond to periodic points of the first return map. Hence we would like to understand\nwhich monodromy maps can be realized by first return maps of Reeb flows.\nIt turns out that the answer to Question 1.2 is negative. There is an invariant of an area-preserving\ndiffeomorphism h, called the flux, which is an obstruction to h being the first return map of a\nReeb flow. In Section 2 we define the flux and also show that it is easy to modify the flux of a\ndiffeomorphism within its isotopy class.\nThe case of particular interest to us is when h is pseudo-Anosov. Recall that a homeomorphism\n\u223c\nh : S \u2192 S is pseudo-Anosov if there exist \u03bb > 1 and two transverse singular measured foliations\n- the stable measured foliation (F s , \u03bcs ) and the unstable measured foliation (F u , \u03bcu ) - such that\nDate: This version: September 19, 2008.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

The homeomorphism h is a diffeomorphism\naway from the singular points of the measured foliations. A pseudo-Anosov representative h of a\nmapping class is unique in the sense that any two pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms h1 , h2 in the\nsame mapping class are conjugate via an everywhere smooth diffeomorphism \u03c6 which is isotopic\nto the identity. In particular, such a \u03c6 sends the stable foliation of h1 to the stable foliation of h2\nand the unstable foliation of h1 to the unstable foliation of h2 . (See [FLP, Expos\u00e9 12, Th\u00e9or\u00e8me\nIII and Lemma 16 for smoothness].) We define the area form \u03c9 to be given by the product of \u03bcs\nand \u03bcu . The form \u03c9 is the unique h-invariant area form up to a constant multiple, and is singular in\nthe sense that it vanishes at the singular points of the invariant foliations. Now, the pseudo-Anosov\ncase is of special interest since the pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism is a rigid representative in its\nmapping class (hence the flux can be seen as an invariant of the mapping class) and also since it is\nknown that every contact structure is carried by an open book decomposition whose monodromy\nis isotopic to a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism [CH1]. Hence we ask the following question:\nQuestion 1.3. Can every pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism h be expressed as the first return map\nof a Reeb flow R\u03b1 ?\nThe main theorem of this paper is Theorem 2.4, which states that the answer to this question is\nalso negative, i.e., the flux is not always zero for pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms.\n2. T HE\n\nFLUX\n\nThe goal of this section is to give basic properties of the flux; see [Ca]. The discussion will be\ndone more generally on a compact symplectic manifold, since it might be more transparent in that\ncontext.\n2.1. Flux. Let (S, \u03c9) be a compact symplectic manifold and h be a symplectomorphism of (S, \u03c9).\nLet h\u2217 : H1 (S; Z) \u2192 H1 (S; Z) be the map on homology\ninduced from h and let K be the kernel\nR\nof h\u2217 \u2212 id. Also let \u0393 be a lattice of R generated by \u03a3 \u03c9, where [\u03a3] ranges over H2 (S; Z). Then\ndefine the map\nFh : K \u2192 R/\u0393\nas follows: Let [\u03b3] \u2208 K. Since \u03b3 is homologous to h(\u03b3), one can find an oriented singular\ncobordism C (mapped into S) whose boundary consists of h(\u03b3) \u2212 \u03b3. We then define\nZ\nFh (\u03b3) =\n\u03c9.\nC\n\n\u2032\n\nTwo cobordisms C, C with the same boundary differ by an element of H2 (S; Z); hence the quantity is well-defined only up to \u0393. It is straightforward to verify that Fh (\u03b3) also only depends on the\nhomology class of \u03b3. The number Fh ([\u03b3]) \u2208 R/\u0393 is thus well-defined and is called the flux of h\nalong \u03b3. We say the flux of h is nonzero if the image of K is not [0] \u2208 R/\u0393.\nIf h1 , h2 are two symplectomorphisms of (S, \u03c9) and [\u03b3] = [h1 (\u03b3)] = [h2 (\u03b3)], then\nFh2 \u25e6 Fh1 ([\u03b3]) = Fh2 ([\u03b3]) + Fh1 ([\u03b3]).\nIn other words, the flux is a homomorphism, when viewed as a map from the group Symp0 (S, \u03c9)\nof symplectomorphisms which act trivially on H1 (S; Z) to Hom(H1 (S; Z), R/\u0393) = H 1 (S; R/\u0393).\nWe can also easily modify the flux of any h \u2208 Symp0(S, \u03c9) by composing with time-1 maps of\nlocally Hamiltonian flows.\n\n\fON THE FLUX OF PSEUDO-ANOSOV HOMEOMORPHISMS\n\n3\n\nIf in addition \u03c9 = d\u03b2, then the form h\u2217 \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2 is a closed 1-form and the flux of h along \u03b3 can be\nrewritten as\nZ\nFh ([\u03b3]) = h\u2217 \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2,\n\u03b3\n\nby the use of Stoke's formula. The flux of h is nonzero if and only if [h\u2217 \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2] 6= 0 on K.\nMoreover, \u0393 = 0.\n2.2. 2-forms on the mapping torus. Let \u03a3(S, h) = (S \u00d7 [0, 1])/(x, 1) \u223c (h(x), 0) be the mapping torus of (S, \u03c9). It fibers over the circle with fiber S.\nThere is a natural closed 2-form \u03c9h on \u03a3(S, h), which is obtained by setting \u03c9h = \u03c9 on S \u00d7[0, 1]\nand identifying via the symplectomorphism h. The 2-form \u03c9h pulls back to \u03c9 on S \u00d7{t}, t \u2208 [0, 1],\nand its kernel is directed by \u2202t , where t is the coordinate for [0, 1].\nWe have the following lemmas:\nLemma 2.1. Suppose \u03c9 is exact. If h is the first return map of a Reeb vector field R\u03b1 where \u03b1\nsatisfies d\u03b1|S\u00d7{0} = \u03c9, then h is a symplectomorphism of (S, \u03c9). Moreover, d\u03b1 = \u03c9h .\nProof. Consider the contact 1-form \u03b1 = f dt + \u03b2 on S \u00d7 [0, 1], where f = f (x, t) is a function and\n\u03b2 = \u03b2(x, t) is a 1-form in the S-direction. Write \u03b2t (x) = \u03b2(x, t). We compute\nd\u03b1 = dS f \u2227 dt + dS \u03b2t + dt \u2227 \u03b2\u0307t ,\nt\nwhere dS is the exterior derivative in the S-direction and \u03b2\u0307t = d\u03b2\n. By the condition d\u03b1|S\u00d7{0} = \u03c9,\ndt\nwe have dS \u03b20 = \u03c9. Since we can normalize R\u03b1 = g\u2202t , where g = g(x, t), it follows that\niR\u03b1 d\u03b1 = g(\u2212dS f + \u03b2\u0307t ) = 0 and \u03b2\u0307t = dS f is an exact form on S. Hence dS \u03b2t is independent\nof t and equals \u03c9. This shows that d\u03b1 = dS \u03b2t = \u03c9h . By the invariance of \u03b1 under the map\n(x, t) 7\u2192 (h(x), t \u2212 1), we see that h preserves \u03c9.\n\u0003\n\nLemma 2.2. Suppose \u03c9 is exact and the flux of h is nonzero. Then [\u03c9h ] is nonzero in H 2 (\u03a3(S, h); Z).\nHence h cannot be realized as the first return map of a Reeb vector field R\u03b1 .\nProof. Let \u03b3 be a curve\nR in S such that Fh (\u03b3) is nonzero. Then \u2212\u03b3 and h(\u03b3) bound a subsurface\nC \u2282 S \u00d7 {0} so that C \u03c9R 6= 0. WeR construct a closed 2-cycle C \u2032 in \u03a3(S, h) by gluing \u03b3 \u00d7 [0, 1]\nwith C. Now we see that C \u2032 \u03c9h = C \u03c9 6= 0. Hence [\u03c9h ] 6= 0 in H 2 (\u03a3(S, h); Z). By Lemma 2.1,\nh cannot be the first return map of a Reeb vector field.\n\u0003\nConversely, when \u03c9 is exact and h is the identity near \u2202S, we have a criterion, due to Giroux\n(see [Co]), to realize h as the first return map of a Reeb vector field. The condition that h = id near\n\u2202S is not realized in general for pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms, but in practice it is possible to\ndeform the diffeomorphism near \u2202S so that it is the identity, without altering the sets of periodic\npoints too much; see [CH2].\nLemma 2.3 (Giroux). Let (S, \u03c9 = d\u03b2) be a compact exact symplectic manifold and h be a symplectomorphism of (S, \u03c9), which is the identity near \u2202S. If [h\u2217 \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2] = 0 in H 1 (S; R), then there\nexists a contact form \u03b1 on \u03a3(S, h) and a Reeb vector field R\u03b1 whose first return map on one fiber\nis h.\n\n\f4\n\nVINCENT COLIN, KO HONDA, AND FRAN\u00c7OIS LAUDENBACH\n\nProof. We have that h\u2217 \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2 = df . Note that df = 0 near \u2202S since h = id near \u2202S. One can\nalways translate f so that f is strictly positive on S and is constant near \u2202S. The 1-form \u03b1 = dt+\u03b2\nis a contact form on S \u00d7 R whose Reeb vector field is \u2202t . It is invariant under the diffeomorphism\nH : (x, t) 7\u2192 (h(x), t \u2212 f (x)),\nand thus induces a contact form \u03b1 on \u03a3(S, h) \u2243 (S \u00d7 R)/((x, t) \u223c H(x, t)).\n\n\u0003\n\n2.3. Surface case. Let us now specialize to the case of interest: S is a compact oriented surface, \u03c9\nis an area form on S, and h is an area-preserving diffeomorphism of (S, \u03c9). Let us assume without\nloss of generality that the \u03c9-area of S is 1. If \u2202S = \u2205, then \u0393 = Z since H2 (S; Z) is generated by\n[S]. On the other hand, if \u2202S 6= \u2205, then \u0393 = 0 and the exactness of \u03c9 is automatically satisfied.\nThe goal of this note is to prove the following:\nTheorem 2.4. There exist a compact surface S with empty (resp. non-empty) boundary and a\npseudo-Anosov homeomorphism h of S with h\u2217 = id, whose flux with respect to the singular\nh-invariant area form \u03c9 is nonzero, as viewed in R/Z (resp. R).\nWe now discuss a technical issue, namely the fact that h is only C 0 at the singular set L =\n{p1 , . . . , pk } of the stable/unstable foliations. Let \u03c9 be the h-invariant singular area form given by\nthe product \u03bcu \u2297 \u03bcs of both transverse measures. It is singular in the sense that it is a 2-form which\nvanishes on L. As a measure it is equivalent to any Lebesgue measure on S. Hence, according to\na theorem of Oxtoby-Ulam [OU], it is conjugated by a homeomorphism to a smooth area form.\nInstead of the Oxtoby-Ulam approach, our approach will be based on Moser's lemma. Let D be\nan arbitrarily small open neighborhood of L so that each connected component of D is a polygonal\nregion whose boundary consists of subarcs of leaves of F s or F u . Then we have the following:\nLemma 2.5. There exist an everywhere smooth area form \u03c9 \u2032 onRS and a Rdiffeomorphism h\u2032 , which\ncoincide respectively with \u03c9 and h outside of D and satisfy (i) D0 \u03c9 = D0 \u03c9 \u2032 for each connected\ncomponent D0 of D and (ii) (h\u2032 )\u2217 \u03c9 \u2032 = \u03c9 \u2032 .\nProof. Let \u03c9 \u2032 be an area form which coincides with \u03c9 on S \u2212 (D \u2229 h(D)), and has the same\narea as \u03c9 on each connected component D0 of D. (By using an auxiliary area form on S, the\nconstruction of such an \u03c9 \u2032 becomes equivalent to the extension of a positive smooth function with\na fixed integral.) There also exists a smooth diffeomorphism \u03c8 of S which coincides with h on\nS \u2212D. Note that the germ of h along \u2202D extends to an embedding of D into S. By the construction\nof \u03c9 \u2032 and \u03c8, we have \u03c8 \u2217 \u03c9 \u2032 = \u03c9 \u2032 on S \u2212 D.\nWe now claim that\nZ\nZ\n\u2217 \u2032\n\u03c9\u2032\n\u03c8 \u03c9 =\nD0\nR\nR\nRD0\nR\nfor each component D0 of D. We have D0 \u03c9 \u2032 = D0 \u03c9 = D0 h\u2217 \u03c9 = h(D0 ) \u03c9, by our choice\nR\nR\nof \u03c9 \u2032 and the h-invariance of \u03c9. On the other hand, we have D0 \u03c8 \u2217 \u03c9 \u2032 = h(D0 ) \u03c9 \u2032 by a change\nR\nof variables. If D0\u2032 is the component of D that nontrivially intersects h(D0 ), then D\u2032 \u2229h(D0 ) \u03c9 =\n0R\nR\nR\nR\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032 \u03c9 and \u03c9 = \u03c9 on D0 \u2212h(D0 ). From this we deduce that h(D ) \u03c9 =\n\u2032 \u2229h(D ) \u03c9 , since D \u2032 \u03c9 =\nD\nD\n0\n0\n0\n0\nR 0\n\u2032\n\u03c9 . The claimed equality follows.\nh(D0 )\nFinally, Moser's lemma applies on D to the pair of area forms \u03c9 \u2032 and \u03c8 \u2217 \u03c9 \u2032. It yields a diffeomorphism \u03c6 of D which is the identity near the boundary (hence extends to S by the identity of S \u2032 )\n\n\fON THE FLUX OF PSEUDO-ANOSOV HOMEOMORPHISMS\n\n5\n\nsuch that \u03c6\u2217 (\u03c8 \u2217 \u03c9 \u2032) = \u03c9 \u2032 . We set h\u2032 = \u03c8 \u25e6 \u03c6. This diffeomorphism meets the required condition\nboth on S \u2032 and D, hence on S.\n\u0003\nIf we choose \u03b3 so that both \u03b3 and h\u2032 (\u03b3) avoid the small neighborhood D of the singular locus L\n(after isotopy), then we see that Fh (\u03b3) = Fh\u2032 (\u03b3). Since the flux only depends on the curve up to\nisotopy, it follows that Fh = Fh\u2032 .\nRemark. When F s and F u are orientable, the transverse measures define 1-forms that are closed\nbut not exact. They are eigenvectors for h\u2217 with eigenvalues \u03bb and \u03bb1 . Thus if h\u2217 = id, then the\nfoliations are not orientable.\n3. P ROOF\n\nOF\n\nT HEOREM 2.4\n\nLet S = Sg be a closed oriented surface of genus g and \u03b1 and \u03b2 be two 1-dimensional submanifolds of S, i.e., the union of disjoint simple closed curves.\nWe recall that \u03b1 and \u03b2 fill S if \u03b1 and \u03b2 intersect transversely and minimally and if each region of\nS \u2212 (\u03b1 \u222a \u03b2) is a 2n-gon with n > 1. Such a system of curves allows one to define two systems of\nflat charts, the \u03b1- and the \u03b2-charts, in the following way: The set \u03b1 \u222a \u03b2 gives a cell decomposition\nof S. Consider its dual cell decomposition. (By this we mean we place a vertex vPi in the interior\nof each component Pi of S \u2212 (\u03b1 \u222a \u03b2). If Pi and Pj share an edge of \u03b1 \u222a \u03b2, then take an edge from\nvPi to vPj which passes through the common edge of \u03b1 \u222a \u03b2 exactly once.) Let E\u03b2 be the union of\nedges of the dual cellular decomposition that meet \u03b2. Then E\u03b2 cuts S into annuli whose cores are\nthe components of \u03b1 that we call the \u03b1-charts.

We start with a genus 2 surface S2\u2032 , together with simple closed curves \u03b12\u2032 and \u03b22\u2032 which are\nboth nullhomologous in S2\u2032 , fill S2\u2032 and intersect 8 times. See Figure 2. (To see that \u03b22\u2032 separates,\ntake the algebraic intersection number with a suitable basis for H2 (S2\u2032 ; Z).)

For i = 1, 2, pick a disk Di\u2032 \u2282 Int(Hi\u2032 ).\nWe now take a second copy (S2\u2032\u2032 , \u03b12\u2032\u2032 , \u03b22\u2032\u2032 , D1\u2032\u2032 , D2\u2032\u2032) of (S2\u2032 , \u03b12\u2032 , \u03b22\u2032 , D1\u2032 , D2\u2032 ) and glue S2\u2032 \\ (D1\u2032 \u222a D2\u2032 )\nto S2\u2032\u2032 \\ (D1\u2032\u2032 \u222a D2\u2032\u2032 ) by identifying \u2202Di\u2032 and \u2202Di\u2032\u2032 , i = 1, 2. We call S5 the resulting surface. See\nFigure 3. Let \u03b11 = \u2202D1\u2032 = \u2202D1\u2032\u2032 and \u03b21 = \u2202D2\u2032 = \u2202D2\u2032\u2032 .\nNext, take one connected component of \u03b22\u2032 \u2229 \u2202H1\u2032 and one connected component of \u03b22\u2032\u2032 \u2229 \u2202H1\u2032\u2032 ,\nand make the connected sum of these two components along an arc which crosses \u03b11 exactly once\nand stays inside (H1\u2032 \\ Int(D1\u2032 )) \u222a (H1\u2032\u2032 \\ Int(D1\u2032\u2032 )). We call \u03b22 the result of this sum of \u03b22\u2032 and \u03b22\u2032\u2032 .\nBy construction, #(\u03b11 \u2229 \u03b22 ) = 2. Now do the same operation with components of \u03b12\u2032 and \u03b12\u2032\u2032 in\n\u2202H2\u2032 and \u2202H2\u2032\u2032 , so that the resulting curve \u03b12 satisfies #(\u03b12 \u2229 \u03b21 ) = 2.\nBy construction, we see that #(\u03b12 \u2229\u03b22 ) = 8+8 = 16. The families \u03b1 = \u03b11 \u222a\u03b12 and \u03b2 = \u03b21 \u222a\u03b22\nfill S5 . Since \u03b12\u2032 and \u03b12\u2032\u2032 were nullhomologous, the same also holds for \u03b12 . Finally it is clear that\n\u03b11 and \u03b21 are disjoint and cobordant in S5 .\n\u0003\nThe system \u03b1 = \u03b11 \u222a \u03b12 , provided by Lemma 3.1, comes with two (oriented) \u03b1-charts U1 \u2283 \u03b11\nand U2 \u2283 \u03b12 , where Ui = [0, ni ] \u00d7 [0, 1]/(0, y) \u223c (ni , y), ni denotes #(\u03b1i \u2229 \u03b2), namely n1 = 2,\nn2 = 18, and \u03b1i = [0, ni ] \u00d7 { 12 }/ \u223c.

It preserves the area coming from the\nsingular flat metric on the charts.\nSince \u03b12 and \u03b22 are homologous to zero and \u03b11 and \u03b21 form a bounding pair, h induces the\nidentity on homology.\n\u0003\nLemma 3.3. The flux of h is nonzero, when viewed in R/Z. More precisely, if \u03b3 is a curve so that\n\u03c4\u03b2\u22121\n(\u03b3) has geometric intersection one with each of \u03b11 and \u03b21 , then Fh ([\u03b3]) 6= 0.\n2\nProof. Let \u03b4 be a closed geodesic with respect to the singular flat metric which corresponds to\nthe singular flat coordinate system. In other words, \u03b4 is a piecewise affine curve, with corners at\nsingularities of the affine structure.\nFirst we claim that \u03c4\u03b2\u22121\nhas zero flux, i.e., the area between \u03b4 and \u03c4\u03b2\u22121\n(\u03b4) is zero for all \u03b4. (Note\n2\n2\n\u22121\nthat \u03c4\u03b22 (\u03b4) is not necessarily a flat geodesic even if \u03b4 is.) Indeed, since \u03c4\u03b2\u22121\nis the identity on V1 ,\n2\nwe only have to look on V2 . The curve \u03b4 intersects V2 along a finite union of affine arcs a1 , . . . , an .\nFor any such ai , the concatenation ai of \u2212ai and \u03c4\u03b2\u22121\n(ai ) divides V2 into two components with\n2\nthe same area. This means that the area between ai and \u03b22 = { 12 } \u00d7 [0, 18]/ \u223c is zero. Thus, ai\nbounds a subsurface in S with the same area as the surface bounded by \u03b22 = { 12 } \u00d7 [0, 18]/ \u223c.\nThe sign of this area depends on the sign of the intersection of ai with \u03b22 . Now observe that\n\u03c4\u03b2\u22121\n(\u03b4) \u2212 \u03b4 = \u222a1\u2264i\u2264n ai . Since \u03b22 is homologous to zero, it has as many positive intersections with\n2\n\u03b4 as negative intersections. Thus the total signed area between \u03b4 and \u03c4\u03b2\u22121\n(\u03b4) is the total signed area\n2\nbounded by \u222a1\u2264i\u2264n ai , which in turn is zero. Similarly, we see that \u03c4\u03b12 has zero flux.\nNext suppose the geodesic \u03b4 has geometric intersection one with each of \u03b11 and \u03b21 . We claim\nthat the area between \u03b4 and \u03c4\u03b11 \u25e6 \u03c4\u03b2\u22121\n(\u03b4) equals the area A bounded by \u03b11 \u222a \u03b21 in S. Since\n1\n\u03b11 \u2229 \u03b21 = \u2205, it follows that Int(U1 ) \u2229 Int(V1 ) = \u2205 and the affine representatives \u03c4\u03b11 and \u03c4\u03b2\u22121\n1\ncommute. The curve \u03b4 intersects V1 along a connected affine arc b and U1 along a connected affine\narc a. The concatenation of \u2212b and \u03c4\u03b2\u22121\n(b) is a closed curve b which cuts V1 into two components\n1\nof the same area. Similarly, a, obtained as the concatenation of \u2212a and \u03c4\u03b11 (a), divides U1 into two\n(\u03b4) cobound a\ncomponents of the same area. Then \u03c4\u03b11 \u25e6 \u03c4\u03b2\u22121\n(\u03b4) \u2212 \u03b4 equals a \u222a b, and \u03b4 and \u03c4\u03b11 \u25e6 \u03c4\u03b2\u22121\n1\n1\n\u22121\n\u22129\n9\nsubsurface in S5 of area A. By the commutativity of \u03c4\u03b11 and \u03c4\u03b21 , we have \u03c4\u03b11 \u25e6 \u03c4\u03b21 = (\u03c4\u03b11 \u25e6 \u03c4\u03b2\u22121\n)9 .\n1\nHence the area between \u03b4 and \u03c4\u03b191 \u25e6 \u03c4\u03b2\u22129\n(\u03b4) is 9A.\n1\n1\nWe now claim that A = 2 Area(S) = 12 . This is due to the symmetry of the \u03b1- and \u03b2-charts:\nThe chart U1 is decomposed by \u03b11 = [0, 2] \u00d7 { 12 }/ \u223c into two pieces with the same area. On the\nother hand, U2 is decomposed by \u03b21 into two rectangles R1 and R2 . On each Ri , the number of\nintersections between \u03b12 and \u03b22 is 8. Hence Area(R1 ) = Area(R2 ). We conclude that the area\nbetween \u03b4 and \u03c4\u03b191 \u25e6 \u03c4\u03b2\u22129\n(\u03b4) is 9A = 29 \u2261 12 \u2208 R/Z.\n1\nBy putting together the above calculations and observing that Fh ([\u03b3]) only depends on the isotopy class of \u03b3, we see that Fh ([\u03b3]) = A = 12 .\n\u0003\nThis completes the proof of Theorem 2.4 when \u2202S = \u2205.\nTo treat the case with boundary, we notice that the homeomorphism we have constructed fixes\nthe singular points of the invariant foliations. We pick one of them and blow up the surface at this\npoint. The homeomorphism h lifts to a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism on the blown-up surface\nS which fixes the blown-up foliations. It also induces id\u2217 on H1 (S; Z) and has nonzero flux.\n\n\fON THE FLUX OF PSEUDO-ANOSOV HOMEOMORPHISMS\n\n9\n\nOn the other hand, it is easy to construct pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms with vanishing flux\nthat act trivially on H1 (S; Z). Let \u03b11 , \u03b21 be simple closed curves which fill S and are both nullhomologous. As explained in [FLP, Expos\u00e9 13, Section III], if we compose twists along these curves\n(positive Dehn twists along \u03b11 represented by \u03c4\u03b11 and negative Dehn twists along \u03b21 represented\nby \u03c4\u03b2\u22121\n, where we use at least one \u03c4\u03b11 and at least one \u03c4\u03b2\u22121\n), we obtain a pseudo-Anosov homeo1\n1\nmorphism. The argument developed in the proof of Lemma 3.3 tells us that the flux is always zero.\nMore precisely, consider the singular flat metric compatible with \u03b11 and \u03b21 , and let \u03b4 be a closed\ncurve represented by a flat geodesic. As in the second paragraph of the proof of Lemma 3.3, the\narea between \u03b4 and \u03c4\u03b11 (\u03b4) is zero for all \u03b4, since \u03b11 is separating. Similarly, the area between \u03b4\nand \u03c4\u03b2\u22121\n(\u03b4) is zero for all \u03b4. Hence, if h is any composition of \u03c4\u03b11 and \u03c4\u03b2\u22121\n(both with zero flux),\n1\n1\nthen it also has zero flux. This justifies the fact that, in the proof of Theorem 2.4, we have to look\nat more elaborate examples to find nonzero flux.\nAnother case when h can be realized as the first return map of a Reeb flow is when h\u2217 \u2212 id is\ninvertible and \u2202S 6= \u2205. We learned the following lemma from Yasha Eliashberg.\nLemma 3.4. Let h be a diffeomorphism of a surface S with nonempty boundary which preserves\nan area form \u03c9. If 1 is not an eigenvalue of h\u2217 , then \u03c9 admits a primitive \u03b2 such that [h\u2217 \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2] = 0\nin H 1 (S; R).\nProof. Pick any primitive \u03b20 of \u03c9. By hypothesis, the map h\u2217 \u2212 id is surjective. Thus, one can find\n[\u03b8] \u2208 H 1 (S; R) such that [h\u2217 \u03b20 \u2212 \u03b20 ] = (h\u2217 \u2212 id)[\u03b8]. Now we have that \u03b2 = \u03b20 \u2212 \u03b8 is a primitive\nof \u03c9 and that [h\u2217 \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2] = 0 in H 1 (S; R).\n\u0003\nNow, by applying Lemma 2.3, h can be realized as the first return map of a Reeb vector field.\nWe end this section with the following questions:\nQuestion 3.5. Is it possible to find a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism of a surface S which acts\ntrivially on H1 (S; Z) and takes some noncontractible curve \u03b3 to a curve h(\u03b3) that can be isotoped\naway from \u03b3?1\nIf yes, the flux of such a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism would automatically be nonzero.\nQuestion 3.6. Let g and h be two pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms acting trivially on H1 (S; Z)\nsuch that the composition g \u25e6 h is isotopic to a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism f . Suppose the\nflux of g is zero and the flux of h is nonzero. Is the flux of f nonzero?\nIf yes, this procedure would allow us to produce many pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms with\nnonzero flux.\n4. A\n\nQUESTION\n\nThere is an invariant of an isotopy class of surface diffeomorphisms [h] which is defined in a\nmanner much like the flux. We thank Ian Agol for bringing this to the authors' attention. Let S be\na hyperbolic surface with geodesic boundary. If [\u03b3] \u2208 K, i.e., [h(\u03b3) \u2212 \u03b3] = 0, then represent h(\u03b3)\nand \u03b3 by geodesics, and compute the area bounded by the two geodesics.

This gives rise to a map\nG[h] : K \u2192 R/\u0393,\nwhere \u0393 = 2\u03c0\u03c7(S)Z when S is closed and \u0393 = 0 when S has boundary. When restricted to the\nTorelli group T (S), we have a homomorphism:\nG : T (S) \u2192 H 1 (S; R/\u0393) \u2243 Hom(H1 (S; Z), R/\u0393),\n[h] 7\u2192 G[h] .\nSince the pseudo-Anosov representative of a mapping class is basically unique, we ask:\nQuestion 4.1. Is Fh = G[h] for h pseudo-Anosov and in T (S), up to an overall constant factor?\nFinally, we briefly discuss the relationship to the monotonicity condition for an area-preserving\ndiffeomorphism h, described in Seidel [Se]. Suppose that \u03c7(S) < 0. On \u03a3(S, h) consider the\ntangent bundle W to the fibers and let c1 (W ) be its first Chern class. The monotonicity condition\nrequires that [\u03c9h ] = \u03bbc1 (W ) for some real number \u03bb. Using the notation from Lemma 2.2, one\ncan verify that hc1 (W ), C \u2032i = \u03c7(C) for homology classes of type C \u2032 . Here C is the surface with\n\u2202C = h(\u03b3) \u2212 \u03b3. This means that monotonicity holds if and only if Fh and G[h] are proportional.\n(A similar, but slightly more complicated, monotonicity condition also appears in the definition of\nperiodic Floer homology of h. See [HS].)\nAcknowledgements. We thank Yasha Eliashberg and Sylvain Gervais for very helpful conversations.
