INTRODUCTION\n\nLaser-cooling [1] allows to cool ions and atoms to very low temperatures. For this purpose, the full knowledge of\nthe effects of the various physical parameters determining the cooling process is very important. Among the various\nschemes, Raman sideband cooling has been demonstrated to be a very successful technique for preparing atoms in\nthe ground state of a harmonic potential [2]. This cooling method exploits two stable or metastable atomic internal\nlevels, which we call |gi and |ei, connected by dipole transitions to a common excited state |ri. The transitions are\nusually driven by alternating pulses. A typical sequence alternates a coherent pulse, in which the atom is coherently\ntransferred from |gi to |ei via a properly designed Raman pulse, with a re-pumping pulse, in which the atom is\nincoherently re-scattered to |gi by means of a laser resonant with |ei \u2192 |ri. A change of the motional state during the\nrepumping is a process of higher order in the ratio \u03c9R /\u03bd of the recoil frequency \u03c9R = h\u0304k 2 /2m and the trap frequency\n\u03bd, with m being the mass of the atom and k the wave vector of the one-photon transition. In the Lamb-Dicke regime,\nwhere \u03c9R \u226a \u03bd, the probability for a change of the motional state is negligible and therefore, on the average, the\nsystem is cooled at a rate of one phonon of energy h\u0304\u03bd per cooling cycle. Since there is a finite probability for the atom\nto be returned to the state |ei instead of being repumped, a number of incoherent scattering events may be required\nbefore the atom is finally scattered into |gi, which significantly increases the motional energy at the end of the optical\npumping, reducing the cooling efficiency. Furthermore, since two and three level schemes are realized using Zeeman\nor hyperfine substates, decays from |ri into other electronic substates can occur, leading to additional heating.\nIn this work we quantify the effect of a finite branching ratio in pulsed Raman sideband cooling by calculating\nthe average shift and diffusion of the vibrational energy distribution at the end of an incoherent pumping pulse. It\nshould be pointed out that theoretical studies on laser-cooling for multilevel ions exist, which systematically include\nthe branching ratio in their treatments [3\u20135]. Those studies have focussed on the Lamb-Dicke regime and on certain\ncooling schemes. Here, we single out the effect of the branching ratio on cooling for an arbitrary ratio \u03c9R /\u03bd by applying\nsum rules. Hence, we infer the cooling efficiency in the Lamb-Dicke regime and we discuss the result outside the LambDicke regime in connection with the proposal in [6]. In particular, we show that in some parameter ranges the average\neffect of the multiple photon scattering can be described with an effective wave vector keff for the \"effective\" two-level\ntransition |ei \u2192 |gi [3].\nThis article is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the model for the evolution of a trapped ion during\nthe repumping pulse in a Raman transition, and we evaluate the average shift and variance of the ion energy at the\nend of the pulse. In Section 3 we extend our analysis to cases where the channels of decay are multiple. In Section 4\nwe draw some conclusions, and in the Appendix we report the details of our calculations.\nII. MODEL\n\nWe consider a three level atom as in Fig. 1, whose internal levels are a ground state |gi, stable or metastable state\n|ei and excited state |ri of radiative width \u03b3; |gi \u2192 |ri, |ei \u2192 |ri are dipole transitions, with respective probabilities\nof decay pg , pe , where pg + pe = 1. A laser resonantly drives the transition |ei \u2192 |ri with Rabi frequency \u03a9e . In the\nfollowing we assume the wave vectors for both transitions to be equal to k, which is a good approximation if, e.g., |ei\n\n1\n\n\fand |gi are hyperfine components of the ground state. We study the ion motion in one-dimension.\nThe master equation for the atomic density matrix \u03c13 is written as (h\u0304 = 1):\nd\n\u03c13 = \u2212i [H0 + V, \u03c13 ] + L\u03c13 ,\ndt\n\n(1)\n\nH0 = \u03b4|eihe| + \u03bda+ a.\n\n(2)\n\nwhere H0 has the form:\n\nHere, \u03b4 is the detuning of the laser on the |ei \u2192 |ri transition, which we take to be zero, and \u03bd is the frequency\nof the harmonic oscillator which traps the ion along the x-direction, with a, a+ annihilation and creation operator,\nrespectively. The interaction of the ion with the laser light is described in the dipole approximation by the operator\nV:\nV =\n\n\u0001\n\u03a9e\nikx\nA+\n+ h.c. ,\ne e\n2\n\n(3)\n\n\u2212\nwith A+\nj = |rihj| (with j = e, g) dipole raising operator, Aj its adjoint, and x the position of the atom. In writing\n(3), (1) we have applied the Rotating Wave Approximation and we have moved to the inertial frame rotating at the\nlaser frequency. Finally, the relaxation super\u2013operator has the form\n\n\u03b3\nL\u03c13 = \u2212 (|rihr|\u03c13 + \u03c13 |rihr|)\n2\nZ 1\nX\n\u2212ikux\npj \u03b3\nduN (u)A\u2212\n\u03c13 eikux A+\n+\nj e\nj ,\n\u22121\n\nj=g,e\n\nwhere N (u) is the dipole pattern of the spontaneous emission, which we take N (u) = 3/8(1 + u2 ).\nIn the limit \u03a9e \u226a \u03b3 we can eliminate the excited state |ri in second order perturbation theory [7], and reduce the\nthree-level scheme to a two level one, with excited state |ei and linewidth \u03b3e = \u03a92e /\u03b3 [3]. In the limit \u03b3 \u226b \u03bd the\nmaster equation for the density matrix \u03c1, projection of \u03c13 on the subspace {|ei, |gi}, can be rewritten as [8]:\n\nwith Heff effective Hamiltonian\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nd\n+\n\u03c1 = \u2212i Heff \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1Heff\n+ \u03b3e [Je \u03c1 + Jg \u03c1] ,\ndt\nHeff = H0 \u2212 i\n\n\u03b3e\n|eihe|,\n2\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\nand with Je \u03c1, Jg \u03c1 jump operators, defined as:\nJj \u03c1 = pj (\u03c3je [J \u2032 \u03c1] \u03c3ej )\n\nwith j = g, e,\n\n(6)\n\nduN (u)e\u2212ik(1+u)x \u03c1eik(1+u)x .\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03c3ij = |iihj| and where\nJ \u2032\u03c1 =\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\nThe solution of Eq. (4) can be written as follows [8]:\nZ t\n\u03c1(t) = S(t)\u03c1(0) + \u03b3e\ndt1 S(t \u2212 t1 )JS(t1 )\u03c1(0) + ...\n0\nZ tn\u22121\nZ t\nZ t1\ndtn S(t \u2212 t1 )JS(t1 \u2212 t2 )Je ...Je S(tn )\u03c1(0) + ... ,\ndt2 ...\n+ \u03b3en\ndt1\n0\n\n0\n\n(8)\n\n0\n\nwith J = Je + Jg , and S(t) is the propagator for the effective Hamiltonian:\n+\n\nS(t)\u03c1(0) = e\u2212iHeff t \u03c1(0)eiHeff t .\n\n(9)\n\nIn Eq. (8) the successive contributions to the multiple scattering event are singled out: The first term on the RHS\ncorresponds to the case in which at time t no spontaneous decay has occurred. The second term describes a single\n2\n\n\fscattering event, and the n-th term n \u2212 1 scattering events. The trace of each term corresponds to the probability\nassociated with each event, and we can thus interpret Eq. (8) as the sum over all the possible paths of the scattering\nevent weighted by their respective probabilities. At t \u2192 \u221e, \u03c1(t) \u2192 \u03c1S , the atom is in |gi and he|\u03c1S |ei = 0. For a\npulse of duration t \u226b 1/\u03b3e we can replace t by \u221e in the integrals of Eq. (8) and assume that the atom has been\nscattered into |gi at the end of the pulse. Now, each term on the RHS of Eq. (8) corresponds to the path associated\nwith a certain number of scattering events into |ei before the atom is finally scattered into |gi. Through (8) we can\nevaluate the shift and the variance of the energy distribution at the end of the repumping pulse, which are defined as:\n\u2206E = Tr{(Hmec \u2212 E0 ) \u03c1S },\nq\n2\n\u03c3E = Tr{(Hmec \u2212 E0 \u2212 \u2206E) \u03c1S },\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\nwhere Hmec = \u03bda+ a and E0 is the initial motional energy of the atom.\n\nA. Evaluation of the average shift and diffusion\n\nFor simplifying the form of the discussion presented below, we rewrite the operator J \u2032 as follows:\n \u0303 + J\u03c1,\n\u02c6\nJ \u2032 \u03c1 = J\u03c1\n\n(12)\n\n \u0303 J\u02c6 are defined as:\nwhere J,\n \u0303 = P |lihl| [J\u03c1] |lihl|,\nJ\u03c1\nl\nP P\n\u02c6\nJ\u03c1 = l l1 ,l1 6=l |lihl| [J\u03c1] |l1 ihl1 |,\n\n(13)\n(14)\n\nand where {|li} is the basis of eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator. For \u03c1(0) = |eihe| \u2297 \u03bc(0), with \u03bc(0) initial\ndistribution over the motional states, and according to Eq. (8) the steady state distribution has the form:\n\u03bc\u221e =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n \u0303 J)\u03bc(0),\n\u02c6\npg pm\u22121\nJ \u0303m \u03bc(0) + F (J,\ne\n\n(15)\n\nm=1\n\nwhere \u03bc\u221e = hg|\u03c1S |gi is the final distribution over the motional states. The first term in the RHS of (15) is the sum\nover all paths from |ei into |gi, where after each jump the density operator is diagonal in the basis {|li}, whereas the\nsecond term contains all other paths. These latter terms can be neglected [9], and for \u03bc(0) = |nihn| the following\nrelation holds:\n#\n\" \u221e\nX\nJ \u0303m |nihn| |si = Dn (s).\n(16)\nhs|\u03bc\u221e |si \u2248 hs|\nm=1\n\nHere, Dn (s) is the probability for the atom to be found in the state |g, si at t \u2192 \u221e, given the initial state |e, ni at\nt = 0. Using the explicit form (13) of J \u0303 in (16), Dn (s) has the form:\nZ 1\n\u221e\n\u221e Z 1\nX\nX\nDn (s) = pg\npm\u22121\n*\ndu\n...\ndum N (u1 )...N (um )\n(17)\n1\ne\n*\n\nm=0\n\u221e\nX\n\n...\n\nk1 =0\n\nk=0\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nkm\u22121 =0\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\n|hs|eika0 (1+u1 )(a\n\n\u2020\n\n+a)\n\n|k1 i|2 ...|hkm\u22121 |eika0 (1+um )(a\n\n\u2020\n\n+a)\n\n|ni|2 ,\n\np\nwhere we have used the relation x = a0 (a+ +a), with a0 = 1/2m\u03bd size of the ground state of the harmonic oscillator.\nSubstituting (17) into Eqs. (10), (11), and applying the commutation properties of a, a+ [see the Appendix], we find:\n7 1\n,\nh\u2206Ei = \u03bd\u03b7 2\n5 1 \u2212 pe\n\"\n#\n\u0012 2 \u00132\npe\n58\n1\n7\u03b7\n27\n2\n2\n\u03c3E = \u03bd \u03b7 (2n + 1)\n,\n+\n5\n1 \u2212 pe\n5\n49 (1 \u2212 pe )2\nwhere \u03b7 = ka0 =\n\np\n\u03c9R /\u03bd is the Lamb-Dicke parameter.\n3\n\n(18)\n(19)\n\n\fB. Discussion\n\nEquation (18) represents the average shift to the vibrational energy at the end of the repumping pulse. For pe = 0\n\u2032\nit corresponds to the average recoil energy \u03c9R\nassociated with one incoherent Raman scattering into |gi. In this case,\nthe second term\nin\nthe\nRHS\nof\nEq.\n(19)\nvanishes,\nand Eqs. (18), (19) describe the scattering of one photon of wave\np\nvector k \u2032 = 7/5k on the effective two-level transition |ei \u2192 |gi. Similarly for pe > 0 an effective wave vector keff\ncan be defined for the incoherent scattering on the two-level transition |ei \u2192 |gi, which has the form\nr\n7\nk\nk\u2032\n\u221a\n=\n.\n(20)\nkeff = \u221a\n5 1 \u2212 pe\n1 \u2212 pe\nThus, keff describes the average mechanical effect on the ion resulting from the multiple scattering of photons during\nthe repumping pulse in a Raman transition with branching ratio (1 \u2212 pe )/pe : This description is valid in the limit in\nwhich we may neglect the second term in the RHS of (19), i.e. for pe and/or \u03b7 sufficiently small. In Fig. 2 the first\nterm of RHS of Eq. (19) is compared with the complete expression for n = 0, for different values of the Lamb-Dicke\nparameter and as a function of pe . Here, we see that keff characterizes the scattering process for almost any branching\nratio in the Lamb-Dicke regime, whereas for \u03b7 = 0.6 an appreciable difference is already visible at pe = 0.2.\nFrom (20) we can define the effective Lamb-Dicke parameter \u03b7eff = keff a0 describing an incoherent scattering into\nthe\n\u221a parameter provides an immediate estimate of the effect of the branching ratio on cooling. For\n\u221a state |gi. This\n\u03b7 n \u226a 1, if \u03b7eff n \u226a 1 the system is still in the Lamb-Dicke regime once it has been finally scattered into |gi.\nFurthermore, the coarse-grained dynamics of the system can be described by a rate equation for the motional states\n|ni projected onto |gi, where the rate of cooling (heating) is the real part of the sum of two terms: one corresponding\nto the component of the fluctuation spectrum of the dipole force at frequency \u03bd (\u2212\u03bd), the other to the diffusion\ncoefficient due to spontaneous emission from the excited state [3,4]. This latter term is proportional to the squared\n2\nLamb-Dicke parameter for the incoherent scattering, and thus in our case to \u03b7eff\n. From the well-known solution of the\nrate equation [10], the diffusion term affects the steady state average vibrational number hni, which is proportional\nto the diffusion coefficient.\nOutside the Lamb-Dicke regime, when \u03c9R is comparable to, or larger than, \u03bd, there are no estabilished ground-state\nlaser-cooling techniques for trapped atoms. Here, we discuss our result in connection to the proposal in [6]. There,\na cooling scheme similar to Raman sideband cooling has been presented, where pulses which pump the atoms to the\nground state alternate with pulses confining the atoms to a limited region of motional energy. These confinement\n\u2032\npulses have two-photon detuning \u03b4c to the red of the two-photon resonance frequency, where \u03b4c \u2248 \u03c9R\n. Then, the\npresence of a branching ratio must be taken into account by choosing \u03b4c \u2248 \u2206E. In this regime, pulses which efficiently\ncounteract the average kick \u2206E can be designed, provided that the following condition is fulfilled:\nkxcoh \u2265 keff ,\n\n(21)\n\nwhere kxcoh is the projection on x of the two-photon wave vector of the coherent pulse. For two counterpropagating\nbeams parallel to x, kxcoh = 2|k| and (21) is fulfilled for pe \u2264 13/20, i.e. up to branching ratios pe /pg \u2248 2. Finally,\noutside the Lamb-Dicke regime the second term in the RHS of Eq. (19) cannot be neglected. Hence, the diffusion is\nlarger, and the efficiency of cooling may decrease dramatically as pe increases.\nIII. EXTENSION TO MULTI-LEVEL SCHEMES\n\nIn the following, we show that the average heating associated with the repumping pulse in multilevel-schemes can\nbe described in the same way as discussed in the previous sections.\nLet us consider the level-scheme of Fig. 3(a), where we have added to the scheme of Fig. 1 a further channel of decay\nfrom |ri into the stable or metastable state |1i, with probability of decay p1 such that p1 + p\u2032e + p\u2032g = 1, where p\u2032e ,\np\u2032g are the probability of decay onto |ei, |gi, respectively. A laser resonantly drives the transition |1i \u2192 |ri with Rabi\nfrequency \u03a91 . For \u03a9e , \u03a91 \u226a \u03b3 the state |ri can be adiabatically eliminated from the equations of motion. In this\nlimit the Master Equation aquires the form\n\u0003\n\u0002\nd\n+\n\u03c1 = \u2212i Heff \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1Heff\ndt\n+p\u2032e \u03b3 \u2032 Je \u03c1 + p1 \u03b3 \u2032 J1 \u03c1 + p\u2032g \u03b3 \u2032 Jg \u03c1,\nwhere \u03b3 \u2032 = \u03b3e + \u03b31 , with \u03b3j = \u03a92j /\u03b3. The effective Hamiltonian is now:\n4\n\n(22)\n\n\fHeff = H0 \u2212 i\n\n\u03b31\n\u03b3e\n|eihe| \u2212 i |1ih1|,\n2\n2\n\n(23)\n\nand the jump operators have the form:\nJi \u03c1 = p i\n\nX\n\nj=1,e\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c3ij J \u0303 + J\u02c6 \u03c3ji ,\n\n(24)\n\nwith i = 1, e, g. The solution at t \u2192 \u221e can be written as:\n\u03bc\u221e =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\np\u2032g (p\u2032e + p1 )m\u22121 J \u0303m \u03bc(0).\n\n(25)\n\nm=1\n\nHence, the shift and variance have the form evaluated in Eqs. (18), (19) where now the probability pg , pe are defined\nas pe = p\u2032e + p1 , pg = p\u2032g (pg + pe = 1). In a similar way we have evaluated these quantities for schemes like the\none shown in fig. 3(b), where a second excited state |2i is coupled to |ei via the same recycling laser tuned on the\ntransition |1i \u2192 |ri. For simplifying the treatment, we assume that a fourth laser resonantly drives the transition\n|1i \u2192 |2i with Rabi frequency \u03a9 (grey arrow in fig. 3(b)). Thus, for low saturation Eq. (22) describes the dynamics,\n(j)\n(2)\n(r)\nwhere now \u03b3i = \u03b3i + \u03b3i (i = e, 1), with \u03b3i being the rate of scattering through the excited state |ji (j = r, 2).\n(r)\n(2)\n(r)\n(2)\nAssuming that \u03a9 is such that \u03b3e /\u03b3e = \u03b31 /\u03b31 = a, the solution in Eqs. (18), (19) applies to this case too, where\nnow pe is defined as:\npe = (p\u2032e + p1 )\n\na\n1\n+\n,\n1+a 1+a\n\n(26)\n\nand the probability pg of decaying into |gi is pg = 1 \u2212 pe .\nThe result (26) shows that the total heating is minimum for a \u226b 1, which can be obtained by choosing properly the\nlaser intensity of the repumping lasers, or simply by removing degeneracies in the Zeeman multiplet, for example with\nthe help of a magnetic field.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have studied the motional heating associated with a finite branching ratio and in the presence of multiple decay\nand excitation channels at the end of a repumping pulse in Raman sideband cooling. The first and second moments\nof the final energy distribution has been evaluated analytically, and the effect of the branching ratio has been singled\nout. We have shown that in a certain range of parameters the diffusion can be described with an effective wave vector\nkeff , corresponding to an effective Lamb\u2013Dicke parameter \u03b7eff for the incoherent scattering on the two-level transition\n|ei \u2192 |gi. Finally, on the basis of this result we have discussed the efficiency of Raman sideband cooling and of a\nrecent proposal of ground-state cooling outside the Lamb-Dicke regime [6].\nAnalogous sum rules and considerations can be applied to Raman cooling for free atoms [11]. In that case the\ncalculations are much simpler, since the total momentum of radiation and atom is a conserved quantity in the\nscattering event.\nIn general, these results can be applied to cooling schemes in multilevel atoms.\nV.
