Our results provide evidence for phase separation into A-type antiferromagnetic and charge-ordered phases for x=0.52 and spin freezing at low temperatures (T < 100 K)\nfor 0.52 \u2264 x < 0.75. A new phase diagram which includes this spin freezing region is proposed.\n\nThe phenomenon of phase separation is crucial for determining the intrinsic properties of many magnetic oxides [1]. The origin of the colossal magnetoresistance\n(CMR) in manganese perovskite structures is often linked\nto the coexistence of ferromagnetic (FM) metallic and antiferromagnetic charge ordered (CO) insulating domains\nor to the formation of nanoscale magnetic clusters [2, 3].\nOne technique which provides information on the local\nmagnetic order is muon spin rotation/relaxation (\u03bcSR).\nIn underdoped cuprates, \u03bcSR has identified the coexistence of superconducting and antiferromagnetic phases\nas well as spin freezing believed to be related to the generation of stripes [4].\nIn this letter we provide direct evidence for spinfreezing and phase separation in electron-doped layered\nmanganite structures using \u03bcSR. We investigate the local magnetic structure and spin dynamics across a series of magnetic structures of La2\u22122x Sr1+2x Mn2 O7 with\n0.4 \u2264 x < 1. For compounds in the Mn4+ -rich half of the\nphase diagram (0.5 < x < 1) neutron diffraction studies\n[5] reveal a progression of antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulating phases: from A-type (0.5 \u2264 x < 0.66) to C/C\u2217 type (0.75 \u2264 x < 0.9) and to G-type (0.9 < x \u2264 1.0).\nFurthermore, no long-range magnetic order (NLRO) has\nbeen observed between the A-type AFM and C/C\u2217 -type\nAFM regions (x=0.66-0.74) [5]. Our experiments measure the temperature dependence of the order parameter in the samples with long-range order (LRO) and\nshow how this is affected by the interplay between magnetic and charge order. Moreover, by cooling a sample\nin the NLRO region, we are able to follow the progressive slowing down of magnetic fluctuations and demonstrate the development of short-range order. Based on\nour results we are able to propose a new phase diagram\nof La2\u22122x Sr1+2x Mn2 O7 (0.5 \u2264 x < 1), supplementing\nthe information already obtained from neutron diffraction [5].\nZero-field \u03bcSR is especially suited for study of shortrange magnetic correlations since the positive muons\nare a sensitive local probe. Because the local magnetic\nfields at muon sites result primarily from dipolar interactions which decay very quickly with increasing distance\n(\u223c 1/r3 ) the effective range investigated with muons is\n\n\u223c 20 \u00c5. In a system having magnetically ordered and disordered regions the \u03bcSR data is composed of two different signals corresponding to different environments, with\nsignal amplitudes roughly proportional to their volume\nfraction. In the case of a magnetically ordered system\nour data are fitted using a relaxation function, Gz (t), of\nthe form\nGz (t) = Arlx exp(\u2212t/T1 ) + Aosc cos(2\u03c0\u03bd\u03bc t) exp(\u2212t/T2 ) (1)\n\nwhere the first term is the longitudinal (spin-lattice) relaxation, the second term is the muon precession at frequency \u03bd\u03bc =\u03b3\u03bc B\u03bc /2\u03c0 in the local internal field, B\u03bc , in the\nordered state, 1/T2 is the transverse relaxation rate and\n\u03b3\u03bc /2\u03c0=135.5 MHz/T is the gyromagnetic ratio. The longitudinal relaxation rate is defined by 1/T1 \u221d (\u03b3\u03bc \u2206B\u03bc )2 \u03c4\nfor rapid fluctuations, where \u2206B\u03bc is the amplitude of the\nfluctuating field and \u03c4 is the Mn-ion correlation time.\nNear a magnetic phase transition \u03c4 (and hence 1/T1 ) increases with cooling due to the critical slowing down. For\npolycrystalline samples, where the local magnetization\npoints along the muon spin direction with probability\n1/3, the corresponding amplitudes are Arlx = Gz (0)/3\nand Aosc = 2Gz (0)/3. Eq. 1 can be generalized in a\nstraightforward manner if there are multiple frequencies\nin the data corresponding to magnetically inequivalent\nsites. Polycrystalline samples (\u223c 0.5 g) were prepared as\ndescribed in Ref. [6]. Zero-field \u03bcSR data for 10 compositions were taken on the EMU beamline at the ISIS\nfacility (Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK) and for 5\ncompositions on the GPS spectrometer at the PSI muon\nfacility (Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland).\nFig. 1 shows \u03bcSR spectra collected at T =1.8 K (at\nPSI). Two oscillations can be distinguished for the Gtype AFM sample, x=0.98, and only one damped oscillation for all others, although for x=0.68 the damping is extremely large. The data were fitted using Eq. 1\nand the obtained parameters are listed in Table I. The\nsource of the internal field is attributed to the aligned\nmanganese moments in the vicinity of the muon. As\na function of hole doping, x, the values of \u03bd\u03bc indicate\nchanges in the local field when the spin structure varies.\nThe precession frequency for x=0.40 is \u03bd\u03bc =28(1) MHz\nat T = 1.8 K (which corresponds to an internal field of\n\n\f2\n\n(c) NLRO\n\nx=0.68\n\n*\n\n(d) C/C -type AFM\n\nx=0.82\n\n1.0\n\n80\n\nx=0.98\n\n(e) G-type AFM\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\nTime (\u03bcs)\n\nTABLE I: Parameters obtained by fitting the \u03bcSR spectra for\nLa2\u22122x Sr1+2x Mn2 O7 at 1.8 K (Fig. 1).\nSample\nx=0.40\nx=0.52\nx=0.68\nx=0.82\nx=0.98\n\n\u03bd\u03bc\n(MHz)\n28(1)\n68(4)\n30(5)\n5.4(2)\n47(2)/76(2)\n\n1/T2\n(\u03bcs\u22121 )\n57(6)\n110(14)\n150(23)\n20(1)\n16(2)\n\n1/T1\n1/(2\u03c0\u03bd\u03bc T2 )\n(\u03bcs\u22121 )\n(%)\n0.005(1)\n0.32(4)\n0.10(1)\n0.26(4)\n0.06(2)\n0.80(18)\n0.03(1)\n0.58(15)\n0.065 0.054/0.034(0.6)\n\nB\u03bc =0.21(1) T), similar to that found for the ferromagnetic system, x=0.3 [7]. The observation of two muon\nfrequencies for the G-type AFM compound, x=0.98, suggests that the muon occupies magnetically inequivalent\nsites in this compound. In oxides the muon site is usually\nabout 1 \u00c5 from an oxygen atom [8]. In the layered manganite structure there are three inequivalent oxygen sites\nO(1), O(2) and O(3) and one likely muon site is close to\nO(2) (0, 0, 0.2) [7].\nThe longitudinal relaxation rate, 1/T1 , at T = 1.8 K\nis 2\u20133 orders of magnitude smaller than the transverse\nrelaxation rate, 1/T2 , indicating that the relaxation of\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0\n\nGz(0)/3\n\n0.4\n\nTN\n\n50 100 150 200 250 300\n\nT (K)\n\n40\n\n0.2\n20\n\nx=0.52\n\n(a)\n0\n\n0.0\n\n\u03bd\u03bc2\n\n80\n\n\u03bd\u03bc (MHz)\n\nFIG. 1: Muon spin relaxation data at T=1.8 K for\nLa2\u22122x Sr1+2x Mn2 O7 with (a) x=0.40 (FM), (b) x=0.52 (Atype AFM), (c) x=0.68 (NLRO), (d) x=0.82 (C/C*-type\nAFM) and (e) x=0.98 (G-type).

A large relative width can be associated\nwith a large distribution of Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions (resulting in a large degree of local magnetic inhomogeneity),\nor with the coexistence of different magnetic phases.\n\nAsymmetry\n\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n\nx=0.40\n\nAsymmetry\n\nGz(t)\n\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n\n(a) FM\n\n\u03bd\u03bc (MHz)\n\n20\n15\n10\n5\n\n0.2\n20\n\nx=0.98\n\n(b)\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n0.0\n300\n\nT (K)\n\nFIG. 2: Temperature dependence of the zero-field muon precession frequency, \u03bd\u03bc , and internal field, B\u03bc , for (a) x=0.52\nand (b) x=0.98. The inset shows the temperature dependence\nof the relaxing asymmetry, Arlx for the two compositions.\n\nThe temperature dependence of \u03bd\u03bc (T), (and hence\nB\u03bc (T)) for x=0.52 and x=0.98 is shown in Fig. 2. For\nx=0.52 we find a discontinuity in \u03bd\u03bc (T) around 100 K.\nThis arises because of the presence of two magnetic\nphases, A-type AFM and a CO phase similar to that\nfound in x=0.5 [10, 11], which compete with each other\nin the region between 100 K and 200 K. Below 100 K\nthe internal field increases significantly due to an additional magnetic transition. This transition coincides with\na broad maximum in 1/T1 [12], signifying a freezing of\nthe local spins. This effect is strikingly similar to that\nobserved in a bilayer cuprate [4], in which a freezing of\nspins of doped holes is superimposed on AFM long-range\n\n\f3\nordered Cu2+ spins. The slow variation of the relaxing asymmetry, Arlx (inset of Fig. 2) between Gz (0) (at\n200 K) and Gz (0)/3 (below 100 K) further confirms the\ntwo-phase model whose volume fraction is temperature\ndependent and that the whole sample is magnetic below\n100 K. The behavior of the x=0.52 compound is in contrast to the G-type AFM compound, x=0.98, for which\nthe drop in the initial asymmetry is much sharper (see\ninset Fig. 2(b)) and both precession frequencies \u03bd\u03bc1 (T )\n0\nand \u03bd\u03bc2 (T ) can be fitted to \u03bd\u03bci (T ) = \u03bd\u03bci\n(1 \u2212 T /TN )\u03b2\n(Fig. 2(b)).

The freezing temperature\nTf (vertical dotted line) separates the static and the dynamic\nregions. The vertical dashed line shows TCO defined as the\nmaximum in the magnetization data, in agreement with electron diffraction studies [15]. The solid lines are a guide to the\neye.\n\nonly to the asymptotic critical regime, gives a reasonable description of the data over the entire temperature\nrange (see Fig. 2(b)), yielding TN =145.0(5) K in agreement with neutron powder diffraction [5] and \u03b2=0.24(2)\n\n(close to the value corresponding to a 2D XY system\n(\u03b2=0.23) [13, 14]).\nOne of the most intriguing regions of the Mn4+ -rich\nphase diagram is x=0.66\u20130.74 where NLRO has been detected using neutron diffraction [5]. Data for x=0.68 at\nT =1.8 K shown in Fig. 1(c) were analyzed using a relaxation function which was (1) Eq. 1 for T \u2264 70 K, (2)\nGz (t) = As e\u2212\u03bbs t + Af e\u2212\u03bbf t for 70 < T \u2264 120 K and\n(3) Gz (t) = Af e\u2212\u03bbf t for T > 120 K and the results of\nthe fitting are presented in Fig. 3. At low temperatures,\nthe strongly damped oscillation frequency decreases upon\nwarming from \u223c 30 MHz at 2 K to \u223c 10 MHz around\n65 K (inset to Fig. 3(b)), suggesting the development of\na quasi-static field at the muon-site indicative of shortrange order. In the low temperature regime we found\nthat modelling data using a Gaussian Kubo-Toyabe relaxation function parameterized by \u2206KT /(2\u03c0) gave similar results (see inset of Fig. 3(b)).\nThe broad static distribution of local fields is quantified\nby the large 1/T2 values which is replaced by the slow dynamic relaxation rate \u03bbs above 70 K (inset to Fig. 3(c)).\nThe damped oscillations disappear above 70 K, the temperature at which 1/T1 exhibits a pronounced maximum,\ncorresponding to the slowing-down of spin fluctuations,\nand we identify this temperature as the spin-freezing temperature, Tf . The amplitudes of the two components Aosc\nand Arlx shown in Fig. 3(b) provide information about\nthe volume fractions of the sample where muons experience static or dynamic spin-lattice relaxation, respectively. Above Tf the oscillatory component, Aosc , (and\nthe corresponding frequency \u03bd\u03bc ) disappears and is replaced by a slowly fluctuating fraction with amplitude As\n(Fig. 3(b)). This fraction decreases upon heating above\nTf and disappears around 120 K. At high temperatures\nthe main source of depolarization is the fast fluctuating spins and the corresponding volume fraction, Af , increases linearly on warming (for 120 K< T < TCO ). This\nsuggests that in this temperature range the short-range\n(CE-type) or dynamic CO dominates the muon depolarization, as found for x = 0.5 [16] and La1\u2212x Cax MnO3\n[17]. The zero-field-cooled magnetization decreases almost linearly with temperature for 120 K< T < TCO due\nto the formation of short-range antiferromagnetic correlations in the CO region (Fig. 3(a)).\nIn the limit of fast fluctuations one can estimate the\ncorrelation time, \u03c4 , of magnetic fluctuations by assuming\nthat the static width of the field distribution is of the order of the average magnetic field sensed by muons at the\nlowest temperature (\u03b3\u03bc \u2206B\u03bc \u223c 2\u03c0\u03bd\u03bc ). We estimate short\ncorrelation times associated with fast fluctuations in the\nrange \u03c4f =10\u221212 \u201310\u221213 s for all samples, in good agreement with other values reported for bilayer manganites\n[18, 19]. For x=0.68, the additional slowly fluctuating\ncomponent observed between 70 K and 120 K fluctuates\nwith a correlation time \u03c4s =10\u22129 \u201310\u221211 s. The existence\nof slow and fast dynamics between Tf < T < 120 K for\n\n\f4\nx=0.68 further sustains the phase separation scenario in\nwhich charge-ordered and ferromagnetic (or A-type or Ctype AFM) regions may coexist in the NLRO region, as\nfound in La1\u2212x Cax MnO3 [20].\n\nLa2-2xSr1+2xMn2O7\nTN\nTCO\nTf\nTRCO\n\n(a)\n\nTN, Tf (K)\n\nCO\n\n200\n\n100\n\n*\n\nA-type\nAFM+CO\n\nC/C -type\nAFM\n\nSPIN FREEZING\n\n0.8\n\n(b)\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\nNLRO\n\n1/(2\u03c0\u03bd\u03bcT2)\n\n0\n\nG-type AFM\n\n300\n\n0.2\n0.0\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7 0.8\nx\n\n0.9\n\ncluster formation and/or magnetic polarons [22, 23] or\nstripe-like structures [24].\nIn conclusion, our \u03bcSR study of electron-doped bilayer\nmanganites yields local magnetic information and provides evidence for magnetic order, phase separation and\nspin freezing. The results are summarized in the phase\ndiagram shown in Fig. 4(a). Spin freezing is observed as\na maximum in 1/T1 for samples with x=0.52-0.75 [12].\nThe spin frozen state thus exists in the region of the\nphase diagram with LRO (x=0.52-0.62) together with a\nLRO state (AFM for x=0.52) and also in the region for\nwhich neutron diffraction failed to detect any LRO. We\nnote that the spin-frozen region of the phase diagram\noverlaps closely with a region in which reentrant chargeordering has been suggested to exist [11, 15, 25, 26]. We\ncan quantify the degree of local magnetic inhomogeneity\nat low temperatures using 1/(2\u03c0\u03bd\u03bc T2 ) (Fig. 4(b)) which\nis largest for the x = 0.68 composition in the NLRO region [5].\nWe thank Ishbel Marshall, Anke Husmann, Alex Amato and Stephen Cottrell for help during experiments and\nEPSRC for financial support.

The charge ordering temperatures were obtained from\nmagnetization data [12]. Solid and dashed lines are guides\nto the eye. (b) Degree of magnetic inhomogeneity at 1.8 K\nexpressed by 1/(2\u03c0\u03bd\u03bc T2 ).\n\nThe freezing mechanism begins with the formation of\nmagnetic clusters at high temperatures. Thermal disorder opposes this tendency, so that with decreasing temperature the regions of correlated spins become larger\nand the spin system is subdivided into independent magnetic clusters of different size with a distribution of blocking temperatures. If a cluster is blocked for a time greater\nthan the time window of the \u03bcSR technique, it will appear frozen or quasistatic and hence Arlx decrease reflects a progressive blocking of clusters by cooling down\ntowards Tf , where all clusters are blocked. Spin-freezing\nphenomena are found in numerous systems, ranging from\nspin-glasses, such as Cu-Mn alloys [21] to lightly-doped\ncuprates, La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 [4]. In our layered manganites\nwe find that short-range charge-ordered fluctuations are\ndynamic at high temperatures (T < TCO ) and become\nstatic below Tf (or in the reentrant charge-ordered region). We note that there has been evidence for spin\nfreezing in manganese perovskites ascribed to magnetic\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n\nE.
