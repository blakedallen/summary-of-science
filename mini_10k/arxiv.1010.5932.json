Differential rotation is a main ingredient of the solar dynamo. Latitudinal differential rotation is described by a simple\nsurface rotation law with dependence on the latitude l and the parameter of differential\nrotation \u03b1:\n\u03a9(l) = \u03a9Equator (1 \u2212 \u03b1 sin2 l)\n(1)\nDifferential rotation of stars has been studied extensively in recent years by Doppler\nimaging (Barnes et al. 2005) and line profile analysis (Reiners 2006).\n2.\n\nSample\n\nThe present work adds 184 stars of the southern sky known to rotate faster than about\n10 km s\u22121 , to be brighter than V = 6, and with colours 0.3 < (B \u2212 V) < 0.9. Emphasis\nwas given to the selection of suitable targets rather than achieving a complete or unbiased sample. Figure 1 shows the HR diagram of all stars analyzed in previous work and\nthe present work by line profile analysis including models by Siess et al. (2000) and\n1\n\n\fMatthias Ammler-von Eiff, Ansgar Reiners\n\n2\n\nthe granulation boundary according to Gray & Nagel (1989). Cool stars are affected by\nmagnetic braking. Therefore, rotational speed is correlated with effective temperature,\nso that these two parameters are degenerate. It is challenging to disentangle the effects\nof effective temperature and rotational speed onto differential rotation (Reiners 2006).\n\n\u221210\n\u22124\n\n\u22125\u22122\n\nvsini < 10 kms\u22121\n10 < vsini < 40 kms\u22121\n40 < vsini < 80 kms\u22121\n80 < vsini < 160 kms\u22121\nvsini > 160kms\u22121\n\nMV\n\n0\n02\n\n4\n5\n\n6\n\n8\n10\n1.2\u2022104\n\nReiners & Schmitt (2003a, slow F & G stars)\nReiners & Schmitt (2003b, fast F stars)\nReiners & Royer (2004, A stars)\nReiners (2006, field stars)\nReiners (2006, cluster stars)\nthis work (CES)\nthis work (FEROS)\n10000\n8000\n6000\nTeff [K] 6.0\u2022103\n1.0\u2022104 effective temperature\n8.0\u2022103\n\n4.0\u2022103\n\nFigure 1.

Solid lines indicate evolutional tracks for 1, 2,\nand 5 M\u2299 with overshooting and the early main-sequence according to Siess et al.\n(2000). The hatched area shows the approximate location of the granulation boundary (Gray & Nagel 1989).\n\n3.\n\nObservations\n\nSpectra with high signal-to-noise ratio and a resolving power of 48,000 were taken with\nFEROS at the ESO/MPG-2.2m telescope, La Silla (Chile), covering the wavelengths\nbetween 360 nm and 920 nm. Spectra of 24 stars with projected rotational velocities\nof less than 45 km s\u22121 were obtained with the CES spectrograph at the ESO-3.6m telescope, La Silla, at a spectral resolving power of 220,000 and a wavelength range of\n614 nm - 617.5 nm.\n\n\fDifferential rotation\n4.\n\n3\n\nLine profile analysis\n\nAn average line profile is derived by least-squares deconvolution of a wide spectral\nrange containing hundreds of spectral lines (Reiners & Schmitt 2002). The line shape\nis best measured in Fourier space by the ratio of the first two zeros of the Fourier\ntransform qq21 (Fig. 2). This ratio is calibrated in terms of the parameter of differential\nrotation \u03b1 (Reiners & Schmitt 2003b). In the case of a rigid rotator, qq21 varies between\n1.72 and 1.83 depending on the limb darkening. Lower values indicate differential rotation while larger values represent the rather hypothetical case of anti-solar differential\nrotation which is most probably caused by a polar spot in the regime of rigid rotation.\nThe derivation of the rotational profile is restricted to stars with a projected rotational\nvelocity v sin i of at least 10 km s\u22121 . Thus, most cool dwarf stars and giants cannot be\nanalyzed.\n\nFigure 2. Models of broadening profiles for different amounts of differential rotation \u03b1 in wavelength space (left) and Fourier space (right). The location of the\nfirst two zeros of the Fourier transform q1 and q2 is used to measure the amount of\ndifferential rotation. Credit: Reiners & Schmitt (2002) reproduced with permission\nc ESO.\n\n5.\n\nResults\n\nThe HR diagram (Fig. 1) is repeated in Fig. 3 now showing the distribution of differential and rigid rotators. The correlation of the amount of differential rotation indicated\nby the ratio qq12 with effective temperature and projected rotational velocity is given\nin Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. Ten stars show clear signatures of differential rotation\nbetween 10 % and 54 %. The amount of differential rotation of four stars is below\n6 % which is below our detection limit and consistent with rigid rotation. Two F stars\n(HD 104731 and HD 124425) with T eff \u2248 6500 K and v sin i . 30 km s\u22121 display the\nlowest values of qq21 measured so far which correspond to a differential rotation of 54 %\nand 44 %, respectively. At the hot side of the granulation boundary, the frequency\nof differential rotators diminishes, i.e. qq21 has values not much less than 1.72-1.83\n(Fig. 4). Three new candidates rotate faster than 200 km s\u22121 . In these cases, the effect might be due to gravitational darkening in the regime of rigid rotation (Reiners\n\n\fMatthias Ammler-von Eiff, Ansgar Reiners\n\n4\n\n2003; Reiners & Royer 2004). The spherical shape of the stellar surface is distorted by\ncentrifugal forces and the resulting temperature variations modify the surface flux distribution. Five stars show signatures which can be explained by anti-solar differential\nrotation or more plausibly by rigid rotation with polar spots. In total, there are 44 stars\nwith spectra consistent with rigid rotation.\n\u221210\n\u22124\n\n\u22125\u22122\n\nrigid (Reiners et al.)\nrigid (CES)\nrigid (FEROS)\ndifferential (Reiners et al.)\ndifferential (CES)\ndifferential (FEROS)\n\nMV\n\n0\n02\n\n4\n5\n\n6\n\n8\n10\n1.2\u2022104\n\nReiners & Schmitt (2003a, slow F & G stars)\nReiners & Schmitt (2003b, fast F stars)\nReiners & Royer (2004, A stars)\nReiners (2006, field stars)\nReiners (2006, cluster stars)\nthis work (CES)\nthis work (FEROS)\n10000\n8000\n6000\nTeff [K] 6.0\u2022103\n1.0\u2022104 effective temperature\n8.0\u2022103\n\n4.0\u2022103\n\nFigure 3.
