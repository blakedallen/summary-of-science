REPKO\nDepartment of Physics and Astronomy, Michigan State University\nEast Lansing, Michigan, 48824, USA\n\nWe examine to what extent several recently discovered narrow resonances can be interpreted as conventional cc\u0304 bound states describable using a potential model.

Introduction\n\u2032\nWith the recent experimental results for several expected states (\u03b7C\nand hC ) in the\ncharmonium spectrum, and the discovery of a state (X(3872)), which could be a\n3\nD2 charmonium level, it seems an appropriate time to revisit the potential model\ninterpretation of the cc\u0304 spectrum. For such models, the challenges seem to be:\n\n\u2022 Are potential models capable of describing the spin splitting in a quantitatively satisfactory way?\n\u2022 Including the additional data, is it possible to determine the Lorentz properties of the phenomenological confining potential?\n\u2022 How well are the leptonic and radiative decays predicted?\n\u2022 Under what circumstances can the state at 3872 MeV be interpreted as a\ncharmonium level?\nHere, we will attempt to answer these questions using a potential model which includes the v 2 /c2 and all one-loop corrections to the short distance potential supplemented with a linear phenomenological confining potential and its v 2 /c2 corrections.\n\n\u2217 Presented\n\nat DPF2004, August 30, 2004\n1\n\n\f2\n\nS. F. Radford, W. W. Repko\n\n2. Potential Models\nPotential models range from non-relativistic forms such as the Cornell model 1\nHC =\n\n4\u03b1S\np2\n+ Ar \u2212\n,\n2m\n3r\n\n(1)\n\nrecently used to identify new charmonium states observable in B decays 2 , to those\nincluding all v 2 /c2 spin-dependent corrections, 3,4 H = HC + VHF + VLS + VT EN ,\nwhich can be used to analyze the spectrum and decays of charmonium 5 . One-loop\nQCD corrections can then be added to complete the non-relativistic treatment.6\nIn our analysis, we utilize a semi-relativistic Hamiltonian of the form\np\n4\u03b1S\nH = 2 p2 + m2 + Ar \u2212\nF (\u03bc, r) + VS + VL = H0 + VS + VL .\n(2)\n3r\nExplicit forms of the short distance potential VS , the long distance potential VL and\nF (\u03bc, r), the one-loop QCD correction to 4\u03b1S /3r, can be found in Ref. 7. The cc\u0304 mass\nspectrum and the corresponding wave functions were obtained using a variational\napproach. The wave functions were expanded as\nN\n\u0010 r \u0011n\nX\ne\u2212r/R Ylm (\u03a9) ,\n(3)\n\u03c8lm (~r) =\nCn\nR\nn=0\nand the Cn 's were determined by minimizing E = h\u03c8 |H |\u03c8i/h\u03c8 |\u03c8i. This procedure\nresults in a linear eigenvalue equation for the Cn 's and the energies. The wave functions corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal and the j th eigenvalue \u03bbj\nis an upper bound on the exact energy Ej . For N = 10, the lowest four eigenvalues\nare stable to a part in 106 .\n3. Results and Conclusions\nThe energies and wave functions were obtained by treating VS +VL as a perturbation\nto H0 and by treating H nonperturbatively. We fit the spectrum to ten well established a cc\u0304 states by adjusting the parameters A, \u03b1S , m, \u03bc and the vector fraction fV\nto minimize \u03c72 . Our nonperturbative fit gives: A = 0.175 GeV2 , \u03b1S = 0.361, m =\n1.49 GeV, \u03bc = 1.07 GeV and fV = 0.18. Interestingly, the perturbative fit yields\nsimilar results for A, \u03b1S and m, but prefers \u03bc = 2.32 GeV and fV = 0. The results\nfor the levels are given in Table 1 and the predicted E1 transitions widths are given\nin Table 2.\nThe semi-relativistic model provides a quantitatively good description of the\ncharmonium spectrum. Of the states included in the fit, only the 3 D1 (3770) is poorly\ndescribed. The E1 widths agree reasonably well with experiment8 . However, based\non the model considered here, the X(3872) cannot be explained solely in terms of a\ncharmonium 3 D2 state described by a potential. Spin effects alone can only separate\nthe 3 D2 from the 3 D1 by 40 MeV or so, which suggests that the inclusion of open\nchannel effects is essential if this identification is to be established.\na 11 S\n\n3\n3\n1\n3\n3\n3\n0 , 1 S1 , 1 P J , 2 S0 , 2 S1 , 1 D 1 , 3 S1\n\nand 23 D1 .\n\n\fDescribing Recently Discovered Narrow States as Quarkonia Using a Potential Model\nTable 1.\n\n\u03b7c\n\nPerturbative and nonperturbative results for the cc\u0304 spectrum.\n\nPert\n\nNon-pert\n\nExpt\n\nPert\n\nNon-pert\n\nExpt\n\n2985\n\n2981\n\n2979.7 \u00b1 1.5\n\n\u03b7c\u2032\n\n3599\n\n3624\n\n(3637.7 \u00b1 4.4)\n3686.0 \u00b1 0.1\n\nJ/\u03c8\n\n3096.9\n\n3096.9\n\n3096.87 \u00b1 0.04\n\n\u03c8\u2032\n\n3686\n\n3686\n\n\u03c70\n\n3418.4\n\n3415.8\n\n3415.1 \u00b1 0.8\n\n\u03c7\u20320\n\n3849\n\n3872\n\n\u03c71\n\n3510.2\n\n3510.4\n\n3510.51 \u00b1 0.12\n\n\u03c7\u20321\n\n3946\n\n3951\n\n3999\n\n3996\n\n3966\n\n3966\n\n\u03c72\n\n3556.5\n\n3556.3\n\n3556.18 \u00b1 0.17\n\n\u03c7\u20322\n\nhc\n\n3527\n\n3524\n\n(3526.21 \u00b1 0.25)\n\nh\u2032c\n\n13 D\n\n3\n\n1\n\n3809\n\n3790\n\n3770 \u00b1 2.5\n\n23 D\n\n1\n\n4174\n\n4157\n\n13 D2\n\n3827\n\n3826\n\n3872 \u00b1 1.0\n\n23 D2\n\n4198\n\n4201\n\n13 D3\n\n3831\n\n3845\n\n23 D3\n\n4209\n\n4223\n\n11 D2\n\n3824\n\n3825\n\n21 D2\n\n4199\n\n4202\n\n3836 \u00b1 13.0\nTable 2.\n\nE1 transition widths.\n\n\u0393\u03b3 (E1) (keV)\n\nTH\n\nEX\n\n\u0393\u03b3 (E1) (keV)\n\nTH\n\n\u03c70 \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8\n\n169\n\n119 \u00b1 17\n\n13 D2 (3826) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c71\n\n314\n\n\u03c71 \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8\n\n357\n\n288 \u00b1 51\n\n13 D2 (3826) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c72\n\n76.3\n\n426 \u00b1 48\n\n13 D\n\n\u03c72 \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8\n\n468\n\nhc \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7c\n\n670\n\n\u03c8\u2032\n\n4160 \u00b1 20\n\n\u2192 \u03b3\u03c71\n\n459\n\n13 D2 (3872) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c72\n\n2 (3872)\n\n119\n\nEX\n\n\u2192 \u03b3\u03c70\n\n22\n\n24.2 \u00b1 2.5\n\n\u03c8(3770) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c70\n\n291\n\n320 \u00b1 100\n\n\u03c8\u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c71\n\n33\n\n23.6 \u00b1 2.7\n\n\u03c8(3770) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c71\n\n125\n\n280 \u00b1 100\n\n\u03c8\u2032\n\n\u2192 \u03b3\u03c72\n\n29\n\n24.2 \u00b1 2.5\n\n\u03c8(3770) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c72\n\n5.6\n\n\u2264 330\n\n\u03b7c\u2032\n\n\u2192 \u03b3hc\n\n22\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis research was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under\nGrant PHY-0244789.\nReferences\n1.
