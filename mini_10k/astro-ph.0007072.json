We report first results of an implementation of a chemical\nmodel in a cosmological code, based on the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) technique. We show that chemical SPH simulations are\na promising tool to provide clues for the understanding of the chemical\nproperties of galaxies in relation to their formation and evolution in a\ncosmological framework.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nRecent observational data of the deep surveys (Canada-France Redshift Survey,\nLyman-break galaxy surveys, the Hubble Deep Field) have provided information\non the astrophysical properties of galactic objects at different stages of evolution of the Universe, making possible to carry out a suitable confrontation of\ndifferent scenarios of structure formation and galaxy chemical evolution. Analytical models of chemical evolution are a very powerful tool to study galaxy\nformation (e.g., Chiappini et al. 1997 and references therein). However, they are\nrestricted by several hypothesis (no inflows or outflows, instantaneous recycling,\netc.), and cannot include dynamical and kinematical evolution of the matter according to its nature (dark matter, baryons) in consistency with a cosmological\nmodel. Steinmetz & Muller (1994) have implemented chemical enrichment in a\ncode based on SPH for the first time (see also Raiteri, Villata & Navarro 1996).\nThese works run prepared-cosmological initial conditions where the formation\nand evolution of one single object is studied.\nFully-consistent cosmological simulations have the advantage of providing\na coherent well-described environment for all objects and a complete record of\n1\n\n\f2\n\nCora, Mosconi, Tissera & Lambas\n\ntheir formation and evolution. We report here results of a chemical model implemented in a fully cosmological SPH code in hierarchical clustering scenarios.\n2.\n\nChemical Implementation and Results\n\nWe have developed a model to implement metal enrichment in a cosmological\ncontext based on the AP3MSPH code described by Tissera et al. (1997).\nA star formation (SF) algorithm has been included based on the Smidth\nlaw. Cold and dense gas particles that satisfy the Jean's instability criterium\nare eligible to form stars. Each star cluster formed in a given baryonic particle\n3/2\nat a SF episode is given by \u2206star = C \u03c1gas \u2206t, where \u2206t is the integration timestep, \u03c1gas the gas density of the particle and C the SF efficiency parameter.\nBaryonic particles carry out the information of the different stellar populations\nformed and the remanent gas mass (hybrid particles). When the gas reservoir\nof a particle is depleted, it is transformed in a star particle.\nParticles are initially formed by Hydrogen and Helium in primordial abundances (H = 0.75, He = 0.25). Metals are produced and ejected to the interstellar medium at the end of the life of stars. Most of the elements are produced\nby Type II supernovae (SNIIe), except for the iron that is mainly produced by\nType I supernovae (SNIe). Each \u2206star formed can be followed up in time and\nthe number of stars of a given mass estimated by assuming an Initial Mass Function (IMF). We adopted a Salpeter IMF with a lower and upper mass cut-off\nof 0.1 and 120 M\u2299 , respectively. We resort to Woosley & Weaver (1995) metal\nejecta tables for SNeII. The adopted nucleosynthesis prescriptions for Type Ia\nSNe are taken from Thielemann, Nomoto & Hashimoto (1993). Type Ib SNe are\nassumed to be half the total number of SNeI and to produce only iron (\u2248 0.3M\u2299\nper explosion). We assume that the life time of binary stars that finish their\nlives as SNI (tSNI ) is \u2248 0.5 \u2212 1 Gyr. Ejected metals are distributed within the\nneighboring sphere of the particle where a \u2206star is formed according to the SPH\ntechnique. Hydrogen and Helium are proportionally decreased according to the\nmetal mass received by the particle (see for details Mosconi et al. 2000).\nGiven an IMF, the free parameters of our chemical model are C, the relative\nrate of different types of supernovae (\u0398SN =SNRII/SNRI) and tSNI . The effects\nof thermal or kinetic energy injection into the ISM due to SN explosions are not\nincluded in this work.\nWe performed SPH simulations consistent with a Cold Dark Matter (CDM)\nspectrum with \u03a9 = 1, \u039b = 0, \u03a9b = 0.1, and \u03c38 = 0.67. We used N = 262144\nparticles (Mpart = 2.6 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 ) in a comoving box of length L = 5h\u22121 Mpc\n(H0 = 100h\u22121 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , h = 0.5). The simulations performed (S1, S2, S3,\nS4) share the same initial conditions but have different SF and SN parameters\n(see Figure 1 for values of these parameters).\nWe identify galaxy-like objects (GLOs) at z = 0 at their virial radius\n(\u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1 \u2248 200) and consider only those with more than 250 baryonic particles\nwithin their virial radius.\nIn hierarchical clustering scenarios, the SF process in GLOs is affected by\nmergers and interactions (Tissera 2000, see also observational evidence in Barton\net al. 1999). In our simulations, we found that SF rate histories can be described\nas series of starbursts supperposed to a continuous component.\n\n\fGalaxy Formation and Chemical Evolution in Hierarchical Hydrodynamical Simulations\nFor each GLO we can also follow the evolution of the metallicity of the\nstellar component and calculate the age-metallicity relation (AMR; e.g. RochaPinto et al. 2000). The mean AMRs estimated for our GLOs show the expected\ntrend with high metallicity stars forming at more recent times in agreement with\nobservations. The dispersion found in the simulations indicates the existence of\ncoeval SF sites of different metallicities at a given time. The values and trend of\nthese relations depend on the particular evolutionary history of each GLO, and\nthe SF and SN model parameters (see Tissera et al. 2000 for details).\nThe [O/Fe] versus [Fe/H] is an important observational constrain for chemical models and may give information on the chemical history of our Galaxy.\nWe estimated this relation for our GLOs. Figure 1 shows a typical example\nFigure 1.\nThe rate of [O/Fe] as a function of [Fe/H] for GLO 596 in\nexperiments S2, S3, S4 and S5. Large circles represent observational\ndata (Gratton et al. 1996).\nwhere we can see how the SN and SF parameters affect the distributions. These\nabundance relations also depend on the the evolutionary history of each GLO.\nThe chemical abundances in the ISM in gas-rich galaxies allows to trace\nthe evolution of individual galaxies, being HII regions and early B-type main\nsequence objects the most accesible probes of interstellar abundances. Fairly\nsteep negative gradients are found: \u22120.07 \u00b1 0.01 dex Kpc\u22121 within 6 < RG < 18\nKpc for oxygen (Smartt & Rolleston 1997). Figure 2 shows abundance gradients of the oxygen for GLOs 596 and 325 as examples. The curves represent\nthe mass-weighted averages of the metal abundances at each particle position:\nthey clearly show negative abundance gradients. The slopes of the calculated\ngradients range from \u22120.01 to \u22120.4 dex kpc\u22121 , in agreement with observations.\nThe differences in the abundance gradient slopes for a given GLO are due to the\nSF mechanism and SN parameters, and the fact that we are only including gas\nin hybrid particles.\nThe slopes of GLO 325 are less pronounced than those of GLO 596. The\ndifferent behaviour may be due to the fact that the gas in GLO 596 forms a welldefined disk, while GLO 325 is a clear spheroid, indicating that their histories\nof formation and evolution have been very different.\nTo sum up, in our simulations, GLOs have different evolutionary history in\nconsistency with a hierarchical clustering scenario that affect their SF rates and\nchemical evolution. This chemical model can take all these physical processes\ninto account, resulting in a powerful tool to study galaxy formation.\nReferences\nBarton, E. J., Geller, M. J., & Kenyon, S.
