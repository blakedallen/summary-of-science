Vavilov 38,\nMoscow, 117942, Russia\n\n1\n\nIntroduction.\n\nTo expansions of topological and uniform spaces as inverse limits several\nworks were devoted [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 20]. Irreducible polyhedral\nexpansions over the field R were very important in [5, 8, 12]. In the case\nof locally compact groups expansions into inverse limits of Lie groups were\ninvestigated in [18, 21]. Such inverse mapping systems expansions may be\nused for the proof of isomorphisms of definite locally convex spaces over the\nfields R or C [13, 14, 15]. In the case of ultrauniform hereditarily disconnected spaces polyhedral expansions over R do not take into account many\nfeatures of such spaces.\nThis work is devoted to the investigation of the problem about inverse\nmapping systems expansions of ultrauniform spaces using polyhedra over\nnon-Archimedean locally compact fields. In \u00a72 preliminary results, definitions and notations are given. In \u00a73 Theorems about expansions of complete\nultrametric and ultrauniform spaces are proved. In \u00a74 absolute polyhedral expansions and inverse mapping systems of expansions for non-complete spaces\nare investigated. There are elucidated cases, when in inverse mapping systems of expansions polyhedra are finite-dimensional over non-Archimedean\nfields L. In particular locally compact ultrauniform groups are considered.\nThe main results are Theorems 3.18 and in \u00a74.\n1\n\n\fThe considered here topological spaces X are hereditarily disconnected\nand zero-dimensional, but in general they are not necessarily strongly zerodimensional, that is this class has representatives with covering dimensions\nfrom 0 to \u221e (see Chapters 6 and 7 in [3]). This article also contains results\nabout a relation of dim(X) and dimensions of polyhedra over L. With the\nhelp of polyhedral expansions it is shown in \u00a75 that there exists a natural\ncorrespondence between ultrauniform X and uniform spaces Y , such that\nthere exists a continuous quotient mapping \u03b8 : X \u2192 Y . That is for each\nX there exist \u03b8 and Y , vice versa for each Y there exist X and \u03b8 such that\nd(X) = d(Y ) and w(X) = w(Y ). Then X is dense in itself if and only\nif Y is such. Moreover, there are natural compactifications cX and c\u03b8 Y\nsuch that \u03b8 has an extension on cX and \u03b8(cX) = c\u03b8 Y . On the other hand,\nit gives a relation between dimensions dimL P of polyhedras P over L in an\nexpansion and dim[\u03b8(P )], also between maxPm dimL Pm and dim[\u03b8(X)]. Then\nan important particular case of polyhedral expansions of manifolds modelled\non non-Archimedean locally convex spaces is investigated. Few results from\n\u00a73 and \u00a74 were announced in [17].\n\n2\n\nNotations and preliminary results.\n\n2.1. Let us recall that by an ultrametric space (X, \u03c1) is implied a set X\nwith a metric \u03c1 such that it satisfies the ultrametric inequality: \u03c1(x, y) \u2264\nmax(\u03c1(x, z); \u03c1(z, y)) for each x, y and z \u2208 X. A uniform space X with ultrauniformity U is called an ultrauniform space (X, U) such that U satisfies\nthe following condition: |x \u2212 z| < V \u2032 , if |y \u2212 z| < V \u2032 and |x \u2212 y| < V , where\nV \u2282 V \u2032 \u2208 U, x, y and z \u2208 X [3, 22]. If in X a family of pseudoultrametrics P is given and it satisfies conditions (UP 1, UP 2), then it induces an\nultrauniformity U due to Proposition 8.1.18 [3].\nLet L be a non-Archimedean field [22]. We say that X is a L-Tychonoff\nspace, if X is a T1 -space and for each F = F\u0304 \u2282 X with x \u2208\n/ F there exists\na continuous function f : X \u2192 B(L, 0, 1) such that f (x) = 0, f (F ) = {1},\nwhere B(X, y, r) := {z \u2208 X : \u03c1(y, z) \u2264 r} for y \u2208 X and r \u2265 0. From\nind(L) = 0 it follows that the small inductive dimension is ind(X) = 0 (see\n\u00a76.2 and ch. 7 in [3]). Since the norm | \u2217 |L : L \u2192 \u0393\u0303L is continuous, then X is\nthe Tychonoff space, where \u0393\u0303L := {|x|L : x \u2208 L} \u2282 [0, \u221e). Vice versa if X is\na Tychonoff space with ind(X) = 0, then it is also L-Tychonoff, since there\n2\n\n\fexists a clopen (closed and open at the same time) neighbourhood W \u220b x\nwith W \u2229 F = \u2205 and as the locally constant function f may be taken with\nf (x) = 0 and f (X \\ W ) = {1}.\nLet us consider spaces C(X, L) := {f : X \u2192 L|f is continuous } and\n\u2217\nC (X, L) := {f \u2208 C(X, L) : |f (X)|L is bounded in R}, then for each finite\nfamily {f1 , ..., fm } \u2282 C(X, L) (or C \u2217 (X, L)) the following pseudoultrametric\nis defined: \u03c1f1 ,...,fm (x, y) := max(|fj (x) \u2212 fj (y)|L : j = 1, ..., m}. Families\nP or P\u2217 of such \u03c1f1 ,...,fm induce ultrauniformities C or C\u2217 respectively and\nthe initial topology on X. If a sequence {Vj : j = 0, 1, ...} \u2282 U is such\nthat V0 = X 2 , pVj+1 \u2282 Vj for j = 1, 2, ..., where p is a prime number, then\nT\nthere exists a pseudoultrametric \u03c1 such that \u03c1(x, y) := 0 for (x, y) \u2208 \u221e\nj=0 Vj ,\n\u03c1(x, y) = p\u2212j for (x, y) \u2208 Vj \\ Vj+1, so Vi \u2282 {(x, y) : \u03c1(x, y) \u2264 p\u2212i } \u2282 Vi\u22121 .\nIndeed, from (x, y) \u2208 Vi \\ Vi+1 and (y, z) \u2208 Vj \\ Vj+1 for j \u2265 i it follows\n(x, z) \u2208 Vi and \u03c1(x, z) \u2264 p\u2212i = \u03c1(x, y). Therefore, ultrauniform spaces may\nbe equivalently characterised by U or P (see \u00a78.1.11 and \u00a78.1.14 in [3] ).\nHenceforth, locally compact non-discrete non-Archimedean infinite fields\nL are considered. If the characteristic char(L) = 0, then due to [23] for\neach such L there exists a prime number p such that L is a finite algebraic extension of the field Qp of p-adic numbers. If char(L) = p > 0,\nthen L is isomorphic with the field Fp (\u03b8) of the formal power series by the\nindeterminate \u03b8, where p is the prime number, each z \u2208 L has the form\nP\nj\n\u2212k(z)\nz = +\u221e\nup to the equivalence\nj=k(z) aj \u03b8 with aj \u2208 Fp for each j, |z|L = p\nof the non-Archimedean valuation, k(z) \u2208 Z, Fp is the finite field consisting\nof p elements, Fp \u0592\u2192 L is the natural embedding.\nFor an ordinal A with its cardinality m = card(A) by c0 (L, A) it is denoted the following Banach space with vectors x = (xa : a \u2208 A, xa \u2208 L)\nof a finite norm kxk := supa\u2208A |xa |L and such that for each b > 0 a set\n{a \u2208 A : |xa |L \u2265 b} is finite. It has the orthonormal in the non-Archimedean\nsense basis {ej := (\u03b4j,a : a \u2208 A) : j \u2208 A}, where \u03b4j,a = 1 for j = a and \u03b4j,a = 0\nfor each j 6= a [22]. If card(A1 ) = card(A2 ) then c0 (L, A1 ) is isomorphic with\nc0 (L, A2 ). In particular c0 (L, n) = Ln for n \u2208 N. Then card(A) is called the\ndimension of c0 (L, A) and it is denoted by card(A) = dimL c0 (L, A).\nLet U be a uniform covering of (X, P) (see \u00a78.1 in [3]), then the collection\n{St(U, U) : U \u2208 U} =: \u2217 U is called the star of U. If \u2217 U is a refinement of a\nuniform covering V, then U is called the star refinement of V.\n2.2. Lemma. Let (X, \u03c1) be an ultrametric space, then there exists an\nultrametric \u03c1\u2032 equivalent to \u03c1 such that \u03c1\u2032 (X, X) \u2282 \u0393\u0303L .\n3\n\n\fProof. Let \u03c1\u2032 (x, y) := supb\u2208\u0393\u0303L ,b\u2264\u03c1(x,y) b, where x and y \u2208 X, either\nL \u2283 Qp or L = Fp (\u03b8). Then \u03c1\u2032 is the ultrametric such that \u03c1\u2032 (x, y) \u2264\n\u03c1(x, y) \u2264 p \u00d7 \u03c1\u2032 (x, y) for each x and y \u2208 X.\n2.3. Lemma. Let (X, P) be an ultrauniform space, then there exists a\nfamily P\u2032 such that \u03c1\u2032 (X, X) \u2282 \u0393\u0303L for each \u03c1\u2032 \u2208 P\u2032 ; (X, P) and (X, P\u2032 ) are\nuniformly isomorphic, the completeness of one of them is equivalent to the\ncomleteness of another.\nProof. In view of Lemma 2.2 for each \u03c1 \u2208 P there exists an equivalent\npseudoultrametric \u03c1\u2032 . They form a family P\u2032. Evidently, the identity mapping id : (X, P) \u2192 (X, P\u2032 ) is the uniform isomorphism. The last statement\nfollows from 8.3.20 [3].\n2.4. Theorem. For each ultrametric space (X, \u03c1) there exist an embedding f : X \u2192 B(c0 (L, AX ), 0, 1) and an uniformly continuous embedding into\nc0 (L, AX ), where card(AX ) = w(X), w(X) is the topological weight of X.\nProof. In view of Theorem 7.3.15 [3] there exists an embedding of X\ninto the Baire space B(m), where m = w(X) \u2265 \u05d00 . In the case w(X) < \u05d00\nthis statement is evident, since X is finite. In view of Lemma 2.2 we choose\nin B(m) an ultrametric \u03c1 equivalent to the initial one with values in \u0393\u0303L such\nthat \u03c1({xi }, {yi }) = p\u2212k , if xk 6= yk and xi = yi for i < k, \u03c1({xi }, {yi }) =\n0, if xi = yi for all i, where {xi } \u2208 B(m), i \u2208 N, xi \u2208 D(m), D(m)\ndenotes the discrete space of cardinality m. Let A = N \u00d7 C, card(C) = m,\n{ei,a |(i, a) \u2208 A} be the orthonormal basis in c0 (L, A). For each {xi } \u2208 B(m)\nwe have xi \u2208 D(m) and we can take xi = ei,a for suitable a = a(i), since\nP\nD(m) is isomorphic with {ei,a : a \u2208 C}. Let f ({xi }) := i\u2208N,a=a(i) pi ei,a ,\nconsequently, kf ({xi }) \u2212 f ({yi })kc0 (L,A) = \u03c1({xi }, {yi }).\nThe last statement of the Theorem follows from the isometrical embedding of (X, \u03c1) into the corresponding free Banach space, which is isomorphic\nwith c0 (L, A) (see Theorem 5 in [15] and Theorems 5.13 and 5.16 in [22]),\nsince each Banach space over a non-Archimedean spherically complete field\nL is isomorphic with c0 (L, A) with the corresponding A. Instead of the free\nBanach space generated by (X, \u03c1\u2032 ) (see also Lemma 2.2), it can be used an\nembedding into the topologically dual space C\u0303b0 (X, L)\u2217 to a space C\u0303b0 (X, L),\nwhich is the space of bounded continuous Lipschitz functions f : X \u2192 L with\nkf k := max{supx\u2208X |f (x)|, supx6=y\u2208X (|f (x) \u2212 f (y)|/\u03c1(x, y))} < \u221e. For each\nS \u2282 X there exists a function f \u2208 C\u0303b0 (X, L) such that \u03c1\u2032 (x, S)/[1+\u03c1\u2032 (x, S)] \u2264\n|f (x)| \u2264 p\u03c1\u2032 (x, S)/[1 + \u03c1\u2032 (x, S)], where \u03c1\u2032 (x, S) := inf y\u2208S \u03c1\u2032 (x, y). To each\n4\n\n\fx \u2208 X there corresponds a continuous functional Gx such that Gx (f ) = f (x),\nso Gx (f ) \u2212 Gy (f ) = f (x) \u2212 f (y). In view of the L-regularity of X we have\nkGx \u2212 Gy k = \u03c1(x, y).\n2.5. Corollary. Each ultrauniform space (X, P) has a topological embedQ\nQ\nding into \u03c1\u2208P B(c0 (L, A\u03c1 ), 0, 1) and an uniform embedding into \u03c1\u2208P c0 (L, A\u03c1 )\nwith card(A\u03c1 ) = w(X\u03c1).\nProof. For each ultrametric \u03c1 \u2208 P of an ultrauniform space (X, P) there\nexists the equivalence relation R\u03c1 such that xR\u03c1 y if and only if \u03c1(x, y) = 0.\nThen there exists the quotient mapping g\u03c1 : X \u2192 X\u03c1 := (X/R\u03c1 ) , where X\u03c1\nis the ultrametric space with the ultrametric also denoted by \u03c1, X\u0303 denotes\nthe completion of X. Then X has the uniform embedding into the limit of\nthe inverse spectra lim\u03c1 X\u0303\u03c1 = X\u0303.\n2.6. Corollary. For each j \u2208 N and f (X) \u2282 c0 (L, AX ) from Theorem\n2.4 there are coverings Uj of the space f (X) by disjoint clopen balls Bl with\ndiameters not greater than p\u2212j and with inf l6=k dist(Bl , Bk ) > 0.\nProof follows from the consideration of the covering of the Banach space\nc0 (L, A) by balls B(c0 (L, A), x, r) with 0 < r \u2264 p\u2212j and x \u2208 c0 , since such\nballs are either disjoint or one of them is contained in another and \u0393L is\nS\ndiscrete in (0, \u221e), where \u0393L := \u0393\u0303L \\ {0}. Then q\u2208J B(c0 , xq , rq ) is the\nclopen ball in c0 with r \u2264 p\u2212j , if all balls in the family J have non-void\npairwise intersections. Taking B(c0 , x, r) \u2229 f (X) we get the statement for\nf (X) using the transfinite sequence of the covering. To satisfy Condition\ninf l6=k dist(Bl , Bk ) > 0 we take rl > r0 > 0 for each ball Bl , where r0 is a\nfixed positive number.\n2.7. Note. A simplex s in Rn may be taken with the help of linear\nfunctionals, for example, {ej : j = 0, ..., n}, where ej = (0, ..., 0, 1, 0, ..., 0)\nwith 1 in the j-th place for j > 0 and e0 = e1 + ... + en , s := {x \u2208 Rn :\nej (x) \u2208 [0, 1] for j = 0, 1, ..., n}. In the case of Ln or c0 (L, A), if to take\nB(L, 0, 1) instead of [0, 1], then conditions xj := ej (x) \u2208 B(L, 0, 1) for j =\nP\n1, ..., n imply e0 (x) = x1 + ... + xn \u2208 B(L, 0, 1) or j\u2208\u03bb ej (x) \u2208 B(L, 0, 1)\nfor each finite subset \u03bb in A respectively due to the ultrametric inequality\n(since B(L, 0, 1, ) is the additive group ), that is s = B(Ln , 0, 1) or s =\nB(c0 (L, A), 0, 1) correspondingly. Moreover, its topological border is empty\nF r(s) = \u2205 and Ind(F r(s)) = \u22121. Let us denote by \u03c0L an element from L\nsuch that B(L, 0, 1\u2212 ) := {x \u2208 L : |x|L < 1} = \u03c0L B(L, 0, 1) and |\u03c0L |L =\nsupb\u2208\u0393L ,b<1 b =: bL .\n2.8. Definitions. (1). A subset P in c0 (L, A) is called a polyhedron\n5\n\n\fS\n\nif it is a disjoint union of simplexes sj , P = j\u2208F sj , where F is a set, sj =\nB(c0 (L, A\u2032 ), x, r) = x + \u03c0Lk B(c0 (L, A\u2032 ), 0, 1) are the clopen balls in c0 (L, A\u2032 ),\nA\u2032 \u2282 A, r = bkL , k \u2208 Z. For each L we fix \u03c0L and such affine transformations.\nThe polyhedron P is called uniform if it satisfies conditions (i, ii):\n(i) supi\u2208F diam(si ) < \u221e,\n(ii) inf i6=j dist(si , sj ) > 0, where dist(s, q) := inf x\u2208s,y\u2208q \u03c1(x, y).\nBy vertexes of the simplex s = B(c0 (L, A), 0, 1) we call points x = (xj ) \u2208\nc0 (L, A) such that xj = 0 or xj = 1 for each j \u2208 A, dimL (s) := card(A).\nFor each E \u2282 A, E 6= A and a vertex e by verge v of the simplex s we call\na subset e + B(c0 (L, E), 0, 1) \u2282 s. A mapping f : C \u2192 D is called affine,\nif f (ax + by) = af (x) + bf (y) for each a, b \u2208 B(L, 0, 1), x, y \u2208 C, where\nC and D are absolutely convex subsets of vector spaces X and Y over L.\nFor an arbitrary simplex its verges and vertexes are defined with the help\nof affine transformation as images of verges and vertexes of the unit simplex\nB(c0 (L, A\u2032 ), 0, 1).\nThen in analogy with the classical case [2] there are naturally defined\nnotions of a simplexial complex K and his space |K|, also a subcomplex and\na simplexial mapping. The latter is characterized by the following conditions:\nits rectrictions on each simplex of polyhedra that are affine mappings over\nthe field L and images of vertexes are vertexes. A simplexial complex K is\na collection of verges v of a simplex s such that each verge v \u2032 of a simplex\nv is in K. The space |K| of K is a subset of |s| consisting of those points\nwhich belong to simplexes of K, where |s| is a topological space of s in\nthe topology inherited from c0 (L, A). This defines topology of |K| also. A\nsimplexial complex has dimL K := supv\u2208K dimL v, where v are simplexes of\nK. A subcomplex L of K is a subcollection of the simplexes of K such that\neach verge of v of a simplex s in L is also in L, so L is a simplexial complex.\nIf e is a vertex of K, the open star of e is the subset StK (e) of K which is\nthe union of all simplexes of K having e as a vertex.\nInstead of the barycentric subdivision in the classical case we introduce\nj\na p -subdivision of simplexes and polyhedra for j \u2208 N and for the field L,\nthat is a partition of each simplex B(c0 (L, A\u2032 ), x, r) into the disjoint union\nof simplexes with diameters equal to rp\u2212j , where p = b\u22121\nL . Each simplex s\n\u2032\nwith dimL s = card(A ) may be considered also in c0 (L, A), where A\u2032 \u2282 A,\nsince there exists the isometrical embedding c0 (L, A\u2032 ) \u0592\u2192 c0 (L, A) and the\nprojector \u03c0 : c0 (L, A) \u2192 c0 (L, A\u2032 ). By a dimension of a polyhedron P we\n\n6\n\n\fcall dimL P := sup(s\u2282P,s is a simplex ) dimL s. The polyhedron P is called\nlocally finite-dimensional if all simplexes s \u2282 P are finite dimensional over\nL, that is, dimL s \u2208 N. For a simplex s = B(c0 (L, A\u2032 ), x, r) by a L-border \u2202s\nwe call the union of all its verges q with the codimension over L equal to 1\nin c0 (L, A\u2032 ) =: X, that is, q = e + B \u2032 , where B \u2032 are balls in c0 (L, A\") =: Y ,\n(A\u2032 \\ A\") is a singleton, A\" \u2282 A\u2032 , X \u2296 Y = L, Y \u0592\u2192 X. For the polyhedron\nS\nS\nP = j\u2208F sj by the L-border we call \u2202P = j\u2208F \u2202sj , where F is the set.\n(2). A continuous mapping f of a set M, M \u2282 c0 (L, A) into a polyhedron\nP we call essential, if there is not any continuous mapping g : M \u2192 P for\nwhich are satisfied the following conditions:\n(i) g(M) does not contain P ;\n(ii) there exists M0 \u2282 M, M0 6= M with f (M) \u2229 \u2202P = f (M0 ) = g(M0 ) \u2282\n\u2202P and their restrictions coincide f |M0 = g|M0 ;\n(iii) if f is linear on [x, y] := {tx + (1 \u2212 t)y|t \u2208 B(L, 0, 1)} \u2282 M, then g\nis also linear on [x, y] such that g(x) 6= g(y) for each f (x) 6= f (y).\n(3). The function f from \u00a72.8.(2) is inessential, if there exists such g.\n(4). Let f : M \u2192 N be a continuous mapping, c0 (L, A) \u2283 N \u2283 P , P be\na polyhedron. Then P is called essentially (or inessentially) covered by N\nunder the mapping f , if f |f \u22121 (P ) is essential (or inessential respectively).\n(5). Let f : M \u2192 P and g : M \u2192 P are continuous mappings, where M\nis a set, P is a polyhedron. Then g is called a permissible modification of f ,\nif three conditions are satisfied:\n(i) from a \u2208 M and f (a) \u2208 s it follows g(a) \u2208 s, where s is a simplex\nfrom P ;\n(ii) if x and y \u2208 M, [x, y] \u2282 M and f : [x, y] \u2192 P is linear, then\ng : [x, y] \u2192 P is also linear (over L) and g(x) 6= g(y) for each f (x) 6= f (y);\n(iii) f (\u2202M) = g(\u2202M), when M contains a polyhedron Q with dimL Q > 0\nsuch that Q is clopen in M.\n(6). The mapping f : M \u2192 P is called reducible (or irreducible), when\nit may (or not respectively) have the permissible modification g such that\nf (M) is not the subset of g(M).\n(7). A mapping f : P \u2192 Q for polyhedra P and Q is called normal, if\n(i) \u03c1Q (f (x), f (y)) \u2264 \u03c1P (x, y) for each x and y \u2208 P , that is f is a nonstretching mapping;\n(ii) there exists a pj -subdivision Q\u2032 of polyhedra Q such that f : P \u2192 Q\u2032\nis a simplexial mapping, that is, f |s is affine on each simplex s \u2282 P and f (s)\n\n7\n\n\fis a simplex from Q\u2032 .\n(8). Let X = limj {Xj , fij , E} be an expansion of X into the limit of\ninverse spectra of polyhedra Xj over L. This expansion is called\n(a) irreducible, if for each open V \u2282 X there exists a cofinal subset EV \u2282\nE such that {Xj , fij , EV } is also the irreducible polyhedral representation of\nthe space V , that is fij : Xj \u2192 Xi are irreducible and surjective for each\ni \u2265 j \u2208 EV . The polyhedral system (representation) {Xj , fij , E} is called\n(b) n-dimensional, if dimL Xj \u2264 n for each j \u2208 E, supj\u2208E dimL Xj = n,\nwhere n is a cardinal number. The polyhedral spectrum is called\n(c) non-degenerate, if projections fij are non-degenerate, that is fij (s) is\nnot a singleton for each simplex s of Xj .\n2.9. Notes. Conditions 2.8.(2(iii), (5(ii, iii)) and restrictions on fij in\n2.8.(8(a)) are additional in comparison with the classical case. They are\nimposed in \u00a72.8, since there exists a continuous non-linear retraction r :\nsj \u2192 \u2202sj for the non-Archimedean field L, which may be constructed with\nthe help of a p-subdivision and projections of c0 (L, A) are on its subspaces\nc0 (L, A\u2032 ) associated with the standard basis {ej : j \u2208 A}, where A\u2032 \u2282 A. If\nf is simplexial on each polyhedron M and 2.8.(2(iii)) is accomplished, then\ndimL g(M) = dimL f (M).\nIn [9, 10] were studied uniform spaces and ANRU. Here we mean by\nANRU an ultraunifrom space X such that under embedding into an ultrauniform space Y there exists the uniformly continuous retract r : V \u2192 X\nof its uniform neighbourhood V , X \u2282 V \u2282 Y . We denote by U(X, Y ) for\ntwo ultrauniform spaces X and Y an ultrauniform space of uniformly continuous mappings f : X \u2192 Y with the uniformity generated by a base of the\nform W = {(f, g)|(f (x), g(x)) \u2208 V for each x \u2208 X}, where V \u2208 V, V is a\nuniformity on Y corresponding to PY .\nHere we call an ultrauniform space Y injective, if for each ultrauniform\nspace X with H \u2282 X and an uniformly continuous mapping f : H \u2192 Y\nthere exists an uniformly continuous extension f : X \u2192 Y .\n2.10. Theorem. B(c0 (L, A), 0, 1) is an injective space for card(A) < \u05d00 .\nProof may be done analogously to Theorem 9 on p. 40 in [10].\n2.11. Theorem. Each uniform polyhedron P over L is ANRU.\nProof. Since a = inf i6=j\u2208F dist(si , sj ) > 0, b = supi\u2208F diam(si ) < \u221e,\nthen there exists a minimal uniform covering U such that for each si there\nexists a/p-clopen neighbourhood Vi \u2208 U, where Vi = s\u01ebi , \u01eb = a/p, A\u01eb = {y \u2208\nY : dY (y, A) = inf a\u2208A dY (y, a) \u2264 \u01eb} for an ultrametric space (Y, dY ) is an\n8\n\n\f\u01eb-enlargement of a subset A in Y . In this case P is a subset of a Banach\nspace c0 (L, A), where card(A) = w(P ). Each si is an uniform retract Vi ,\nri : Vi \u2192 si , consequently, there exists uniformly continuous retraction r :\nS\nS = Vi \u2208U Vi \u2192 P such that r|si = ri for each i, since supi\u2208F diam(si ) < \u221e\nand ri \u25e6 ri = ri , ri |si = id, hence r \u25e6 r = r and r|P = id. The neighbourhood\nS\nS is uniform, since St(P, U) := (A\u2208U,A\u2229P 6=\u2205) A = S [3].\n2.12. Note. Further for uniform spaces are considered uniformly continuous mappings and uniform polyhedra and for topological spaces continuous\nmappings and polyhedra if it is not specially outlined.\n2.13. Lemma. Let (X, P) be an ultrauniform strongly zero-dimensional\nspace, P be a polyhedron over L, A1 ,...,Aq are non-intersecting closed subsets\nin X, q \u2208 N, card(P ) \u2265 q. Then there exists an uniformly continuous\nmapping f : X \u2192 P such that f (Ai ) \u2229 f (Aj ) = \u2205 for each i 6= j.\nProof. There exists a disjoint clopen covering Vj for X satisfying Aj \u2282 Vj\nfor each j = 1, ..., q (see Theorem 6.2.4 [3]). Then we can take locally constant\nor locally affine mapping f with f (Vj ) \u2282 sj \u2282 P .\n2.14. Lemma. Each non-stretching mapping f : E \u2192 P has nonstretching continuation on (X\u0303, \u03c1), where P is a uniform polyhedron over L,\nE \u2282 X, X\u0303 is a completion of an ultrametric space (X, \u03c1).\nProof. There exists an embedding P \u0592\u2192 c0 (L, A) for card(A) = w(P )\ndue to Lemma 4 [15] or Theorem 2.4 above. We choose f : E \u2192 c0 (L, A) with\nf = (f i : i \u2208 A), f i : E \u2192 Lei , where (ei : i \u2208 A) is the orthonormal basis in\nc0 (L, A) and inf (i6=j,si and sj \u2282P ) dist(si , sj ) > 0, si are simplexes from P . Each\nmapping f i : E \u2192 Lei is non-stretching, that is kf i (x) \u2212 f i (y)k \u2264 \u03c1(x, y)\nfor each x, y \u2208 E. Evidently, f has non-stretching extension on \u1ebc such that\n\u1ebc is closed X\u0303. On the other hand, due to Theorem 2.4 there exists \u01eb > 0\nsuch that f has a non-stretching extension f : E \u01eb \u2192 P \u01eb . By Theorem 2.11\nfor sufficiently small \u01eb > 0 there exists a retraction r : P \u01eb \u2192 P such that\nr\u25e6f : E \u01eb \u2192 P is is non-stretching, r\u25e6f = f on \u1ebc. There exists V clopen in X\u0303\nsuch that E \u2282 V \u2282 E \u01eb due to Lemma 2.2, hence r \u25e6 f |V has a non-stretching\nextension of f from E, since (X\u0303, \u03c1) is strongly zero-dimensional. This follows\nalso from the fact that a free Banach space B(E, \u03c1\u2032 , L) over L generated by\nE has the isometric embedding into B(X, \u03c1\u2032 , L), where \u03c1\u2032 is from Lemma 2.2\n(see also [15]).\n2.15. Definitions. An ultrauniform space (X, P) is called LE-space, if\neach uniformly continuous f : Y \u2192 L has an uniformly continuous extension\n9\n\n\fon all X, where Y \u2282 X.\nLet X be a Tychonoff space. If X has the finest uniformity compatible\nwith its topology, then it is called fine.\n2.16. Theorem. An ultrametric space X is an LE-space if and only\nif X\u0303 = lim{Xm , fnm , E}, where Xm are fine spaces and bonding mappings\nfnm : Xm \u2192 Xn are uniformly continuous for each m \u2265 n \u2208 E, {Xm , fnm , E}\nis an inverse mapping system.\nProof. Let us consider XA = B(c0 (L, A), 0, 1) for card(A) \u2265 \u05d00 or XA =\nLn which are not fine spaces, since on XA there are continuous f : XA \u2192 L\nwhich are not uniformly continuous. If XA is fine, then each continuous\nfunction f : XA \u2192 L is uniformly continuous. Then for the embedding\nof the non-fine space XA \u0592\u2192 c0 (L, A) there is not compact H with XA \u2282\nH \u2282 c0 (L, A). Therefore, in XA there exists a countable closed subset of\nisolated points Y = {xi : i \u2208 N} and a continuous function f : Y \u2192 L\nwith |f (xj ) \u2212 f (xi )|/|xj \u2212 xi | > ci > 0 for each j \u2265 i and limi\u2192\u221e ci = \u221e\nsuch that f has a continuous extension g on XA . Indeed, there exists a\nclopen neighbourhood W , that is a b-enlargement (with b > 0) relative to\nthe ultrametric \u03c1A in XA , so there is a continuous retraction r : W \u2192 Y ,\ng(x) = const \u2208 L on (XA \\ W ), g(x) = f (r(x)) on W , g|Y = f . Therefore, g\nis continuous and uniformly continuous on XA (see also Theorem 1.7 [1] ).\n\n3\n\nPolyhedral expansions.\n\n3.1. Theorem. Each complete ultrauniform space (Y, P) is a limit of an\ninverse spectra of ANRU Yj , where Yj are embedded into complete locally\nL-convex spaces.\nProof. In view of Corollary 2.5 there exists a uniform embedding Y \u0592\u2192\nQ\n\u03c1\u2208P c0 (L, A\u03c1 ) =: H. In each c0 (L, A\u03c1 ) may be taken the orthonormal\nbasis {ej,\u03c1 : j \u2208 A\u03c1 }, card(A\u03c1 ) = w(Y\u03c1) and define canonical neighbourhoods U(f, b; (j1 , \u03c11 ), ..., (jn , \u03c1n )) := {q \u2208 H : |\u03c0ji ,\u03c1i (q) \u2212 \u03c0ji ,\u03c1i (f )| < b for\ni = 1, ..., n}, where \u03c0j,\u03c1 : H \u2192 Lej,\u03c1 are projectors, f \u2208 H, b > 0, n \u2208 N.\nEach clopen subset Zb := H \\ U(f, b; (j1 , \u03c11 ), ..., (jn , \u03c1n )) is uniformly continuous (non-stretching) retract of Zb/p , that is Zb is ANRU. Analogously\nT\nT\neach finite intersections ql=1 Z(fl , bl , (j1l , \u03c1l1 ), ..., (jnl , \u03c1ln )) = kl=1 Zl,bl are also\nTk\nANRU, since Zk,bk \u2283 l=1 Zl,bl and a retraction gk : Zk,bk /p \u2192 Zk,bk produces\nnon-stretching relative to the corresponding pseudoultrametric retraction\n10\n\n\fT\n\nT\n\nT\n\nT\n\ngk : kl=1 Zl,bl /p \u2192 kl=1 Zl,bl . Hence gq \u25e6 ... \u25e6 g1 = g : ql=1 Zl,bl /p \u2192 ql=1 Zl,bl\nis the (non-stretching) retraction. Let S be the ordered family of such\nTq\nT\nZ\u2208S (H \\ Z) = Y . Further as in the proof of\nl=1 Zl,bl \u2282 H \\ Y , then\nTheorem 7.1 [9].\n3.2. Lemma. Let (X, \u03c1X ) and (Y, \u03c1Y ) be ultrametric spaces, f : X \u2192 Y\nbe a continuous mapping such that f |H is a b-mapping (that is \u03c1Y (f (x), i(x)) \u2264\nb for each x \u2208 H), where H is dense in X, b > 0, i : H \u0592\u2192 Y is an embedding. Then X and Y may be embedded into a Banach space W over L such\nthat X with equivalent ultrametric in W and kf (x) \u2212 xk \u2264 b for each x \u2208 X\n(that is f is a b-mapping on X).\nProof. From Theorem 2.4, Lemma 2.3 and Corollary 2.6 it follows that\nthere exists such embedding of X into the corresponding W = c0 (L, A) with\ncard(A) = w(X) with the disjoint clopen covering V = {B(c0 (L, A), xj , bj ) =:\nBj : xj \u2208 H, \u221e > bj > 0, j \u2208 F }. Let Yj := f (Bj ) \u2282 Y , consequently,\ndiam(Yj ) \u2264 b, since f is the b-mapping, that is f realizes the covering of X\nconsisting from subsets of diameters not greater than b. Then \u03c1X (x\u2032 , x\") \u2264\nmax(\u03c1(x\u2032 , xj ), \u03c1(xj , x\")), where x\" \u2208 f \u22121 (y), y \u2208 Yj , x\u2032 \u2208 B(c0 (L, A), xj , bj ),\nf (x\u2032 ) = y, diam(f \u22121 (y)) \u2264 b. Let xi 6= xj , this is equivalent to Bi \u2229 Bj = \u2205\nS\nand is equivalent to \u03c1X (xi , xj ) > b, consequently, Yi \u2229Yj = \u2205 and Y = j\u2208F Yj .\nIn view of continuity of f there exists the embedding of Yj into Bj , since f\nis the b-mapping, w(Y ) \u2264 w(X), 0 < bj \u2264 b and due to Theorem 2.4.\n3.3.1. Lemma. Let there exists a non-stretching (uniformly continuous)\nmapping f : R \u2192 P and a non-stretching (uniformly continuous) permissible\nmodification g : M \u2192 P , where R is a complete ultrametric space (LE-space\nrespectively), P is a polyhedron, M is a subspace in R; if R is a polyhedron let\nM be a subpolyhedron. Then g has a non-stretching (uniformly continuous\nrespectively) extension on the entire R and this extension is a permissible\nmodification of f .\nProof. For a complete ultrametric space R the mapping g has the nonstretching (uniformly continuous) extension on the completion of M which\ncoincides with the closure M\u0304 of M in R, since R and P are complete. The\nspace P is complete, since it is ANRU by Theorem 2.11 (see also Theorem\n1.7 [7], Theorems 8.3.6 and 8.3.10 [3]). For the embedding R \u0592\u2192 c0 (L, A)\nwith card(A) = w(R) by Theorem 2.4 it may be taken due to Corollary\n2.6 the disjoint clopen covering V such that each W \u2208 V has the form\nW = R \u2229 B(c0 (L, A), x, rW ), where rW > 0, x \u2208 R, supW \u2208V rW \u2264 p\u2212j (for\neach j \u2208 N there exists such V ).\n11\n\n\fIn view of uniform continuity of f and uniformity of the polyhedron P\nthere exists V such that for each W from V there exists a simplex T \u2282 P\nwith f (W ) \u2282 T . The space c0 (L, A) has the orthonormal basis {ej : j \u2208 A}.\nIf f is linear on no any [a, b] \u2282 R, then for the construction of g may be used\nLemma 2.14 or Theorem 2.16. This may be done with the help of transfinite\ninduction by the cardinality of sets of vertexes of simplexes from P (or using\nthe Teichm\u00fcller-Tukey Lemma), since P is a disjoint union of simplexes. In\ngeneral let g(M\u0304) contains each zero-dimensional over L simplex T 0 \u2282 P . If\nit is not so, then there exists a point b = f \u22121 (T 0 ) in which g is not defined. If\nf is non-linear on each [a, b] \u2282 R with a \u2208 M\u0304 , then g(b) = f (b). If f is linear\non such [a, b], then from \u03c1(a, b) < \u221e it follows that [a, b] is homeomorphic\nwith the compact ball B(L, a, \u03c1(b, a)) in L and f ([a, b]) is homeomorphic\nwith B(L, f (a), kf (b) \u2212 f (a)k). Then in M\u0304 \u2229 [a, b] = Y there exists y such\nthat \u03c1(y, a) = supx\u2208Y \u03c1(a, x) = t. The subspace Y is covered by the finite\nnumber of W \u2208 V . For y 6= a, that is t > 0, f ([a, b]) is compact and\nis contained in the finite number of simplexes from P , consequently, there\nexists the permissible modification of g on [a, b] also.\nLet E and F be two subsets in R. We denote by sp(E, F, f ) the subS\nspace cl(( (a\u2208E,b\u2208F,f |[a,b] is L\u2212 linear ) [a, b]) \u222a E \u222a F ) in R, where cl(S) denotes the closure of S in R for S \u2282 R. If B = {q : f \u22121 (T 0 ) = q, T 0 \u2282 P, g\nis not defined in q}, then by the Teichm\u00fcller-Tukey Lemma there exists the\nS\nextension of g on sp(M\u0304, B, f ) =: M0 . Let Mj := sp( i<j Mi , B, f ), where\nS\nB = (T j is not the subset of g(M )) T j , T j are simplexes from P with the cardianlity of sets of vertexes equal to j, where j \u2264 w(P ). From Lemma 3.2 it\nfollows that conditions 2.8.(5(i \u2212 iii)) may be satisfied on Mj \u2229 R. ConsidS\nering vertexes of s from R \u2229 f \u22121 (T j ) \\ i<j Mi we construct g on Mj \u2282 R.\nSince R \u0592\u2192 c0 (L, A), then supj Mj = R, where Mj are ordered by inclusion:\nMj \u2283 Mi for each i \u2264 j.\n3.3.2. Note. Henceforth, we assume that for a uniformly continuous\nmapping f : Y \u2192 P are satisfied conditions: P is a uniform polyhedron,\nbonding mappings fnm : Xm \u2192 Xn are uniformly continuous (see \u00a7\u00a72.8,\n2.16), where Y \u2282 X, (X, \u03c1) is an ultrametric space.\n3.4. Lemma. Let f : M \u2192 P is irreducible, M and P are polyhedrons,\nN is a subpolyhedron in M, Q is a subpolyhedron in P , f (N) \u2282 Q, then a\nmapping f : N \u2192 Q is irreducible.\nProof. Let f : N \u2192 Q be reducible, that is there exists a permissible\n12\n\n\fmodification g : N \u2192 Q with g(N) not contained in f (N), q \u2208 f (N) \\ g(N).\nIn view of Lemma 3.3 there exists the extension g : M \u2192 P . Let r > 0\nis sufficiently small and U := Nr = {y \u2208 M : there exists x \u2208 N with\n\u03c1(x, y) \u2264 r} be the r-enlargement of the subspace N such that q \u2208\n/ g(Nr ).\nSince M and P are (uniform) polyhedra and f is (uniformly) continuous\nand U is clopen in M, then there exists a pj -subdivision M \u2032 and a clopen\npolyhedron H in M \u2032 with Nr/p \u2282 N \u2282 U \u2282 M \u2032 such that h|H = g|H , M \u2032 \\ H\nis the subpolyhedron in M \u2032 , h|M \\H = f |M \\H . Then q \u2208\n/ h(H) and from\nthe irreducubility of f it follows that q \u2208\n/ f (M \\ H), consequently, h is the\npermissible modification of f and h(M) is not the subset of f (M). This\ncontradiction lead to the statement of this Lemma.\n3.5. Lemma. Let f : M \u2192 P , M and P be polyhedrons over L. Then\nthe condition of irreducibility of f is equvalent to that each subpolyhedron in\nQ \u2282 P is essentially covered.\nProof. If f is irreducible, then due to Lemma 3.4 each subpolyhedron Q\nis essentially covered. Let vice versa each Q is essentially covered and f has\nthe permissible modification g with P = f (M) not contained in g(M). From\nf (\u2202M) = g(\u2202M) and that f is essential the contradiction with the statement\n{P is not contained in g(M)} follows, consequently, f is irreducible.\n3.6. Lemma. Let P and M be polyhedrons. If f : M \u2192 P has only\naddmissible modifications, then f is irreducible.\nProof. From f (\u2202M) = g(\u2202M) and that g is the permissible modification\nof f it follows that each subpolyhedron Q from P is essentially covered due\nto Lemma 3.3. In view of Lemma 3.5 f is irreducible.\n3.7. Lemma. Let there is an inverse spectra S = {Rm , fnm , E} of polyhedra Rm over L, fnm are simplexial mappings, g l : Rl \u2192 P , g n = g l \u25e6 fln for\na fixed l, fn = limm fnm , g = g l \u25e6 fl , R = lim S, fn : R \u2192 Rn , E is linearly\nordered. If g : R \u2192 P is reducible for a polyhedron P , then for almost all\nn (that is, there exists k \u2208 E such that for each n \u2265 k) g n : Rn \u2192 P are\nreducible.\nProof. In view of Lemma 3.3 there exists a permissible modification h of\ng, then g and h define mappings g n and hn such that hn on Rn are permissible\nmodifications of g n . If g is reducible, then by Lemma 3.5 g n are reducible for\nalmost all n \u2208 E, since h(R) is not a subset of g(R) and h(\u2202R) = g(\u2202R).\n3.8. Lemma. If f : M \u2192 N, g : N \u2192 T , f (M) = N, where M\nand N are polyhedra, then from g is inessential (reducible) it follows f \u25e6 g is\ninessential (reducible).\n13\n\n\fProof. If f is L-linear on [a, b] \u2282 M and g is L-linear on [f (a), f (b)],\nthen f \u25e6 g is L-linear on [a, b]. If h is a permissible modification of g, then\nf \u25e6 h is a permissible modification of f \u25e6 g, hence f \u25e6 g is reducible. If g is\ninessential, then there exists a mapping h such that\n(i) h(N) does not contain T ;\n(ii) there exists N0 \u2282 N such that N0 6= N, g(N) \u2229 \u2202T = g(N0 ) = h(N0 )\nand h|N0 = g|N0 ;\n(iii) if g is linear on [x, y] \u2282 N, then h is linear on [x, y] such that\nh(x) 6= h(y) for each g(x) 6= g(y). Therefore, f \u25e6 h : M \u2192 T satisfies\nConditions (i \u2212 iii) for M instead of N, f \u25e6 h instead of h and f \u25e6 g instead\nof g, consequently, f \u25e6 g is inessential.\n3.9. Lemma. Suppose that there is given an irreducible inverse mapping\nsystem S = {Pm , fnm , E} of polyhedra Pm over L, M is closed in P = lim S\nsuch that Mn := fn (M) are subpolyhedra in Pn and for each m > l permissible\nmodifications glm for flm are given (on the entire Pm ) and for each n > m\nn\nmappings glm \u25e6 fm\nare permissible modifications of flm . Then the inverse\nn\nmapping system SM := {Mn , glm \u25e6 fm\n, El } is irreducible, where El = {n \u2208 E :\nn \u2265 l}.\nProof. From surjectivity and irreducibility of flm it follows surjectivity\nn\nand irreducibility of glm \u25e6 fm\ndue to Lemmas 3.4, 3.5 and 3.8. Since El is\ncofinal with E, then for each W open in M there exists V open in P such that\nW = M \u2229 V . Let dimL Pl = d. We use a disjoint covering of Pl by simplexes\nclopen in it. There exists l \u2264 md \u2208 E such that each d-dimensional simplex\nT d from Tl over L by means of (fln , Mn ) is either essentially for each n \u2265 l\nor inessentially for each n \u2265 md covered. In the second case there exists\na permissible modification klmd such that klmd [(f1md )\u22121 (T d )] does not contain\nany point from T d \\ \u2202T d , hence we get a permissible modification klmd of flmd\non the entire Pmd . If T d is essentially covered by (flmd , Mmd ), then T d is\nessentially covered by (f n , Mn ) for each n \u2265 md .\nLet q < d, where q is a cardinal. Then there exists mq \u2265 md such that for\neach simplexes T q from Pl with dimL T q = q is either essentially for each n \u2265 l\nor inessentially for each n \u2265 mq covered by (fln , Mn ). Since Pl has a disjoint\ncovering by such simplexes and S is irreducible, then SM is irreducible.\n3.10. Lemma. If T is a simplex from a pj -subdivision P \u2032 of polyhedron\nP then for each clopen neighbourhood U \u2283 T such that U is a subpolyhedron\nin P \u2032 there exists a mapping k : P \u2192 P such that k|U is simplexial and\nk(U) = T .\n14\n\n\fProof. In view of Theorem 2.11 there exists the retraction r : P \u2192 U\n(it is uniform if P is the uniform polyhedron). In view of Lemmas 3.2 and\n3.3 there exists a simplexial mapping f : U \u2192 T such that f (U) = T , hence\nk = f \u25e6r is the desired mapping, since r|U = id and r \u25e6r = r, where id(x) = x\nfor each x \u2208 U. To construct f we consider simplexes s of P \u2032 forming its\ndisjoint clopen covering. For each such s either s \u2229 T = \u2205 or s = T . If\ns = B(c0 (L, A), x, r) and T = B(c0 (L, A\u2032 ), y, r \u2032) with A\u2032 \u2282 A, then f |s is\nevidently defined such that f (s) = T . For A\u2032 \u2283 A and A\u2032 6= A we can map s\non the corresponding verge (or vertex) of T . For s = T we can take f |T = id.\n3.11. Lemma. Let P be a uniform polyhedron, f : M \u2192 P and g :\nM \u2192 P are two b-close mappings (that is, \u03c1(f (a), g(a)) \u2264 b for each a \u2208 M),\nwhere b < inf s\u2282P diam(s), s are clopen simplexes in P , then there exists k\nfrom Lemma 3.10 such that k \u25e6 g and f are b-close and k \u25e6 g is a permissible\nmodification of f , where g|[x,y] is L-linear or g(x) 6= g(y) if and only if f |[x,y]\nis L-linear or f (x) 6= f (y) respectively for each [x, y] \u2282 M.\nProof. Let P \u2032 be a subdivision of P constructed with the help of pj subdivisions of P such that j \u2208 N. In view of b < inf s\u2282P diam(s) we have\nthat g(a) \u2208 \u03c4 if and only if f (a) \u2208 \u03c4 for each simplex \u03c4 in P and a \u2208 M. If\nM1 is a clopen polyhedron in M and s is a simplex (or its verge) in M1 , then\nf |s is affine if and only if g|s is the affine mapping, moreover f (s) and g(s)\nhave the same dimension over L and dimL g(q) = dimL f (q) for each verge q\nin s. Therefore, for a polyhedron M1 we can choose k : P \u2192 P such that\nk \u25e6 g(\u2202M) = f (\u2202M), since P is a uniform polyhedron and there exists j \u2208 N\nsuch that p\u2212j sups\u2282P diam(s) < b.\n3.12. Lemma. Let f : P \u2192 Q be a non-stretching mapping of a uniform\npolyhedron P onto a uniform polyhedron Q over L. Then there exists a pj subdivision P \u2032 of P and a normal mapping g : P \u2192 Q such that g is a\npermissible modification of f .\nProof. For each b > 0 there exist a pj -subdivision P \u2032 of P and a pi subdivision of Q and a simplexial mapping h : P \u2032 \u2192 Q, which is b-close to f ,\nsince f is non-stretching. Indeed, simplexes T l \u2282 P \u2032 are disjoint and clopen\nfor them due to Lemmas 3 and 4 [15] h can be chosen such that:\n(i) |h(e) \u2212 f (e)| < b for linearly independent vertexes el,j \u2208 T l , that is,\n{(el,j \u2212 ei,0 ) : j \u2208 Al } are linearly independent, el,0 is a marked vertex from\nT l , card(Al ) = dimL T l and\n(ii) h(T l ) are simplexes in Q with diam(h(T l )) \u2264 diam(T l ) for suitable\nb > 0 and the pi -subdivision Q\u2032 of Q, where h|T l are affine mappings for each\n15\n\n\fl. This is possible due to uniformity of polyhedra P and Q. Taking g = k \u25e6 h,\nwhere k is the suitable mapping from Lemma 3.11 we get the desired g.\n3.13. Lemma. Let g be a permissible modification of f : R \u2192 P and\nh : P \u2192 Q be a normal mapping, where P and Q are uniform polyhedra.\nThen h \u25e6 g is the permissible modification of h \u25e6 f .\nProof. If f (\u2202R) = g(\u2202R), then h \u25e6 f (\u2202R) = h \u25e6 g(\u2202R). If f |[x,y] is Llinear, then g|[x,y] is L-linear, where [x, y] \u2282 R, hence if h \u25e6 f |[u,v] is L-linear,\nthen h \u25e6 g|[u,v] is L-linear and h \u25e6 g(u) 6= h \u25e6 g(v) for each h \u25e6 f (u) 6= h \u25e6 f (v),\nsince h is affine for some pj -subdivision Q\u2032 of Q. If a \u2208 R and f (a) \u2208 s, where\ns is a simplex from P , then g(a) \u2208 s, hence if h \u25e6 f (a) \u2208 \u03c4 , then h \u25e6 g(a) \u2208 \u03c4 ,\nwhere \u03c4 is a simplex in Q, since \u03c1Q (h \u25e6 f (a), h \u25e6 g(a)) \u2264 \u03c1P (f (a), g(a)) and\nh : P \u2192 Q\u2032 is simplexial.\nn\n3.14. Lemma. Let {Pn , fm\n, E} = S be an irreducible inverse system\nof uniform polyhedra over L, M be closed in P = lim S, Mn = fn (M) be\nsubpolyhedra in Pn , {Qk , glk , F } be an inverse spectra of polyhedra Qk , which\nappear by pj(k) -subdivisions of Pn(k) , glk be normal and permissible modifican(k)\ntions of fn(l) , where F is cofinal with E, Nk = gk (M), glk |Nk and gl |M are\nirreducible. Then Nk are polyhedra.\nProof. This follows from Lemmas 3.7-3.12, since an image of a polyhedron under simplexial mapping is a polyhedron (see also the proof of Lemma\nIV.31.XII [5] and [8] starting the consideration from some fixed n1 = q \u2208 E).\n3.15. Lemma. Suppose that for a complete ultrametric space R there is\na non-stretching mapping f : R \u2192 P , f (R) = P , P is a uniform polyhedron\nover L. Then for each b > 0 there exists a b-mapping g : R \u2192 Q and Q is\na uniform polyhedron over L such that for sufficiently fine pj -subdivision Q\u2032\nof a polyhedron Q there exists a normal mapping k : Q \u2192 P and k \u25e6 g is a\nnon-stretching permissible modification of f .\nProof. For R there exists the embedding R \u0592\u2192 c0 (L, A) with card(A) =\nw(R) by Theorem 2.4 and a clopen neighbourhood S with R \u2282 S \u2282 R(r)\nthat is a uniform polyhedron due to Corollary 2.6, where R(r) denotes the\nr = b/p-enlargement of R. By Lemma 3.2 there exists the subpolyhedron\nQ with R \u2282 Q \u2282 S and the b\u2032 -mapping g : R \u2192 Q. If [a, z] \u2282 S and\nf |[a,z] is L-linear, then we can choose g such that it is linear on [a, z] and\ng(a) 6= g(z) when f (a) 6= f (z). From the completeness of R and Lemma 2.14\nit follows that f has the non-stretching extension f : S \u2192 P . Then there\nare a b-mapping g, a uniform polyhedron Q and a non-stretching mapping\n\n16\n\n\fh : Q \u2192 P for sufficiently small r > 0 and b\u2032 > 0. For h due to Lemma 3.12\nthere exists the permissible modification and normal k : Q\u2032 \u2192 P such that\nk \u25e6 g(R) = P , f (\u2202R) = k \u25e6 g(\u2202R) for \u2202R 6= 0, that is, when R contains a\nclopen polyhedron R1 with simplexes T having dimL T > 0. Such k, h and g\nmay be constructed on each simplex T from Q\u2032 and then on the entire space.\n3.16. Lemma. Suppose that R is a complete ultrametric space, fn : R \u2192\nPn are non-stretching bn -mappings, Pn are uniform polyhedra over L, n \u2208 E,\nE is an ordered set such that for each b > 0 there exists l \u2208 E with 0 < bn < b\nfor n > l. Then there exists a normal irreducible inverse mapping system\nn\nS = {Qm , gm\n, F }, F is cofinal with E, lim S = R, Qm are subpolyhedra\nj(m)\nof p\n-subdivisions of Pn(m) and gm are permissible modifications of fn(m) ,\nn\nwhere gm = limn gm\n: R \u2192 Qm .\nProof. In view of Lemmas 3.5, 3.6, 3.13 and 3.14 it is sufficient at first\nto construct S with non-stretching normal normal and surjective mappings\ngnm . This can be done due Lemma 3.15 with glm \u25e6 fn(m) being non-stretching\npermissible modifications of fn(l) and limm glm \u25e6 fn(m) are non-stretching permissible modifications of fn(l) .\n3.17. Lemma. If the ultrametric space (X, \u03c1) is isomorphic with\nlim{(Xm , \u03c1m ); fnm ; F }\nand the following conditions are satisfied:\n(1) for each m there are embeddings qm : Xm \u0592\u2192 (E, \u03c1) into a complete\nspace (E, \u03c1);\n(2) fm : X \u2192 Xm are projections;\n(3) (Xm , \u03c1m ) are ultrametric spaces;\n(4) there is given a family {bm > 0 : m \u2208 F }, bm \u2208 \u03c1(X, X) and for each\nb > 0 the set {m : bm > b} is finite, where tm := inf \u03c1(x,y)>bm \u03c1(qm (x), qm (y))\nand limm tm = 0, for each m > n and x and the inequality \u03c1(qm (x), qn \u25e6\nfnm (x)) < tn is accomplished. Then the mappings qm \u25e6 fm converge uniformly\nto the embedding X \u0592\u2192 E.\nProof. In view of Lemma 2.2 we may suppose that \u03c1(X, X) and \u03c1m (Xm , Xm ) \u2282\n\u0393\u0303(L). If x and y \u2208 X and \u03c1(x, y) > bn , then \u03c1(qn \u25e6 fn (x), qn \u25e6 fn (y)) \u2265 tn .\nFrom conditions (1\u22124) it follows the existence of k such that \u03c1(qm \u25e6fm (x), qm \u25e6\nfm (y)) \u2265 tn for each m > k and for the ultrametric \u03c1, consequently, q =\nlimm qm is the embedding, since \u03c1(q(x), q(y)) \u2265 tn .\n3.18. Theorem. Let (X, P) be a complete ultrauniform space and L be\na locally compact field. Then there exists an irreducible normal expansion of\n17\n\n\f(X, P) into the limit of the inverse mapping system\nn\nS = {Pn , fm\n, E}\n\nof uniform polyhedra Pn over L, moreover, lim S is isomorphic with (X, P),\nin particular for an ultrametric space (X, \u03c1) the system S is the inverse sequence.\nProof. From Corollary 2.5 and Theorem 3.1 it follows the existence of\nthe expansion of (X, P) into the uniformly isomorphic limit of the inverse\nmapping system R = {Yj , fij , F } of ANRU Yj with non-stretching fij , where\nYj are the complete ultrametric spaces. Each Yj is closed in the finite products\nof the spaces c0 (L, Ak ). From Lemmas 3.2-3.17 it follows the existence of\nthe irreducible normal uniform polyhedral expansion for each Yj , moreover,\nusing the permissible modifications of gij of fij and the same Lemmas we can\nconstruct the system of the entire space (X, P) with the same properties.\nWe consider further uniform coverings V corresponding to the uniform\nS\npolyhedra P = W \u2208V W , which due to Theorem 2.11 are ANRU. Let \u03c1 be\nthe pseudoultrametric in X and \u03c1(X, X) \u2282 \u0393\u0303(L). At first, if V is given with\nthe help of the chosen pseudoultrametric \u03c1, then we can associate with V a\npk -nerve with k \u2208 Z, that is, an abstract simplexial complex Nk vertexes of\nwhich are elements from V . Its simplexes are the spans of (pulled on) vertexes\nWj satisfying \u03c1(Wj , Wi ) \u2264 pk b, where b = supW \u2208V diam(W ) < \u221e, each rib\n[Wj , Wi ] from s has the lenghts not less than t = inf Wj 6=Wi \u2208V \u03c1(Wj , Wi ) > 0.\nThen from Nk \u0592\u2192 c0 (L, Ak ) with card(Ak ) = w(Nk ) it follows that each s\nis uniformly isomorphic with some ball B(c0 (L, A), 0, 1), where card(A) =\nm \u2264 w(Nk ). With each V is associated the equivalence relation: xRy if\nand only if there exists W \u2208 V such that x and y \u2208 W , then the quotient\nmapping f : X \u2192 X/R is defined (see Propositions 2.4.3 and 2.4.9 [3]). In\nparticular with each locally finite functionally open covering V is associated\nthe partition of the unity {fW : W \u2208 V }, fW : X \u2192 B(L, 0, 1), fW (x) = 1\nfor x \u2208 W and fW (x) = 0 for x \u2208\n/ W , {fW : W \u2208 V } is subordinated\nto V (see aslo \u00a75.1 [3]). There are the canonical non-stretching mappings\nFk : X \u2192 Nk . If X is compact, then X/R is the finite discrete space and\ndimL Nk = n \u2208 N. Into each V may be refined a disjoint clopen uniform\ncovering K with supW \u2208K diam(W ) \u2264 bp\u2212j , where j \u2208 N. That is, V has the\nuniform strict shrinking.\nIn general there exist abstract simplexial complexes NV with dimL NV \u2265\ndim(X) \u2265 0, if V is an arbitrary functionally open covering of X of order\n18\n\n\fnot less than dim(X). For dim(X) = \u221e we interpret orders of coverings as\ncardinals equal to k \u2265 \u05d00 . This is due to the following second procedure.\nIf {Wj : j \u2208 \u039bW } are elements of a subfamily W of a covering V such\nT\nthat Wj are pairwise distinct and j\u2208\u039bW Wj 6= \u2205, then to W corresponds an\nabstract simplex s in c0 (L, \u039bW ) such that Wj correspond to vertexes of s.\nEvidently, if the simplex s is clopen in the Banach space c0 (L, A), then it is\ncharacterized by two points x, y \u2208 s such that s = B(c0 (L, A), x, |x \u2212 y|). If s\nwith Int(s) = \u2205, then vertexes of s characterize a minimal Banach subspace\nof c0 (L, A) in which s is contained.\nUsing the first procedure we can consider the sequence of such shrinkings:\nm+1\nV\n\u2282 V m with bm = bp\u2212m , where m \u2208 N. With each V m is associated\npk(m) -nerve Nk(m) . Let k(m) \u2265 \u2212m, k(m + 1) \u2264 k(m) for each m \u2208 N and\nlimm\u2192\u221e k(m) = \u2212\u221e. If x is an isolated point in X, then there exists n \u2208 N\nwith max(bn , pk(n) bn ) < inf y\u2208X\\{x} \u03c1(x, y). Then the simplex s \u2282 Nk(m) with\nx \u2208 s and m \u2265 n is zero-dimensional over L, that is, s = {x}.\nBy the construction of Nk for each simplex sm+1 \u2282 Nk(m+1) there exists\nm+1\nsm \u2282 Nk(m) with fm\n(sm+1 ) \u2282 sm , where fij are the bonding mappings of\nm+1\nthe inverse sequence S = {Nk(m) , fim , N). Each fm\nis non-stretching, since\ndecreases the distance at least into p times and bm /bm+1 \u2265 p. If x 6= y, then\nthere exists n with max(bn , bn pk(n) ) < \u03c1(x, y), consequently, for each m > n\nthere are disjoint simplexes s and s\u2032 \u2282 Nk(m) with x \u2208 s and y \u2208 s\u2032 . Therefore, there exists the uniformly continuous mapping g : X \u2192 lim S, where\ng(x) = limm {sm , fim } and sm \u220b x for each m \u2208 N. Therefore, the uniformly\ncontinuous projectors fm : X \u2192 Nk(m) are defined, since for each b > 0 there\nm+r\nexists r \u2208 N such that bm pk(m+r)\u2212k(m) < b and fm (W ) = fm\n\u25e6 fm+r (W )\nm+r\nand diam(fm (W )) < b, where W \u2208 V\n, fm+r (W ) belongs to clopen star\nof the corresponding vertex v \u2208 Nk(m+r) . Further (see also Lemma IV.33\nin [10]) we can verify that g(X) = lim S and g is the uniform isomorphism,\nT\n\u22121\nsince \u221e\nm=l gm (sm ) = {x} for the family {sm : m} corresponding to x (see\nabove).\nEvidently, dimL Nk(m) may be from 0 for k(m) = \u2212m up to card(A)\nwith card(A) = w(X). For k(m) > \u2212m in the inverse sequence S the\nm+1\nmappings fm\nmay map simplexes s from Nk(m+1) into simplexes q from\nNk(m) of lower dimension over L, for example, when Wm+1 \u2282 Wm , Wm \u2208\nV m , Wm = B(c0 (L, Aj ), x, r), Wm+1 = B(c0 (L, An ), x\u2032 , r/p), card(An ) >\ncard(X/Rm ) \u2265 dimL Nk(m) \u2265 card(Aj ), since dimL Nk(m+1) \u2265 card(An ) for\n\n19\n\n\fk(m + 1) > \u2212m \u2212 1. This fact is based on the homeomorphism of D \u05d00 ,\nB(L, 0, 1) and B(L, 0, 1)\u05d00 , where D = {0, 1} is a discrete two-point set (see\nalso [3]).\nFor the complete ultrauniform space (X, P) we can consider the base of\nuniform coverings {V\u03c1n : n \u2208 N, \u03c1 \u2208 P}, where each V\u03c1n is given relative to the\n\u03c1,k(m)\nconsidered \u03c1, S = {N\u03c1,k(m) , f\u03c1\u2032 ,k(m\u2032 ) , P \u00d7 N}. To each V\u03c1m there corresponds\nN\u03c1,k(m) ; \u03c1\u2032 \u2264 \u03c1 if and only if \u03c1\u2032 (x, y) \u2264 \u03c1(x, y) for each x and y \u2208 X;\n(\u03c1\u2032 , m\u2032 ) \u2264 (\u03c1, m) if and only if \u03c1\u2032 \u2264 \u03c1 and m\u2032 \u2264 m. If to associate NV with\ndim(X) and orders of arbitrary functionally open coverings \u1e7cn of the space\nX, then there exist an inverse spectrum of dimension equal to dim(X), where\n\u2217 m\n\u1e7c < \u1e7cn for each m < n \u2208 E, that is \u1e7cm is a star refinement of \u1e7cn . We\ntake {\u1e7cm : m \u2208 E} such that for each x \u2208 X there exists a cofinal subset\nT\nE(x) \u2282 E and a family {\u1e7c\u03b2m : \u03b2 \u2208 E(x)} with \u03b2\u2208E(x) \u1e7c\u03b2m = {x}. Let\nPm = N\u1e7cm for each m \u2208 E and fnm : Pm \u2192 Pn be uniformly continuous\nbonding mappings, g(x) = limm {sm , fim }, where sm are such that sm \u220b x for\neach m \u2208 E. Polyhedra Pm can be chosen such that sup(s\u2282Pm ) diam(s) <\npk(m) b and limm\u2208F k(m) = \u2212\u221e for each linearly ordered subset F of E such\nthat F is cofinal with the first countable ordinal \u03c90 , s are simplexes in Pm ,\nk(m) \u2264 k(n) for each m \u2265 n \u2208 F , where k(m) \u2208 Z, b = const > 0. Then\ng : X \u2192 lim S is a uniform isomorphism. Using permissible modifications\nand Lemmas 3.2-3.17 we get the statement of this theorem.\n\n4\n\nAbsolute polyhedral expansions and their\napplications.\n\nMany of the results from [12] about absolute polyhedral expansions in the\nclassical case (that is, for polyhedra over R) may be transformed in the nonArchimedean case. Further the main differences are given. Part of lemmas\nand definitions from [12] may be naturally reformulated and proved, for example, with the substitution of barycentric subdivision into pj -subdivision.\nWe use Theorems 3.1, 3.18 and apply absolute polyhedral expansions at first\nto each ultrametric space Yj , then to the entire ultrauniform space (X, P).\nThe polyhedra P considered in \u00a74 as well as in \u00a7\u00a72, 3 may have in general\ninfinite dimension over L.\n\n20\n\n\f4.1.1. Definitions and Notes. A proper pj -subdivision of a complex\nK a over L is called normal. Certainly dimL K a may be infinite. With the help\nof affine mappings for each simplexial complex K a the space |K \u2217 | of its pj subdivision is the same as |K a |. This space is denoted by K and is supplied\nwith the ultrametric induced from |K a |. A support of a subset Y \u2282 K\nrelative to complex K a is the least subcomplex containing Y . A support\nof a point is a simplex s in K a of minimal dimL s containing it. If K1a is a\nsubcomplex (clopen) of a complex K a , then the set K \\ K1 is called an open\n(clopen) subcomplex of a complex K a . If A is an open (clopen) subcomplex\nof a complex K a , then a set K \\ A is a space of some subcomplex (clopen)\nof K a , which is denoted by K a \\ A. The closure of an open subcomplex A\nof a complex K a is a subspace of all subcomplexes of K a consisting of all\nsimplexes interiors of which are contained in A and in addition of all its verges\nin the non-Archimedean sense (see \u00a72). The least clopen subcomplex of the\ncomplex K a containing X, X \u2282 K a , is called the polyhedral neighbourhood\nor the clopen star of a set X relative to K a and is denoted K a X. They form\na pointwise finite covering of K. Moreover, a point x \u2208 K is contained in\na clopen simplex \u03c4 if and only if its vertexes {ej : j \u2208 J} are all vertexes\n{ej : j \u2208 J} stars of which contain this point x. A clopen star of a subcomplex\nis by definition a clopen star of its space. A clopen star K a K1 of a subcomplex\nK1a in a complex K a is by definition a union of all clopen simplexes in K a\nwhich have nonvoid verge in the subcomplex K1a . This means that K a K1 is\nalso a union of clopen stars of vertexes of the subcomplex K1a .\nSubcomplex of a complex K a a space of which is a clopen star of a set\nX (subcomplex X a ) is called a star of the set X (subcomplex X a ) and is\ndenoted by (K a X)a or by K\u0304 a X a , if X a is the subcomplex of the complex\nK a.\n4.1.2. Lemma. Let K \u2217 be a normal, that is multiple pj -subdivision, of\na complex K a and t be a simplex in K \u2217 . Then there exists a vertex e \u2208 K a\nsuch that K a t \u2282 K a e. Moreover, if K1a is the subcomplex of the complex K a\nsuch that |t| \u2229 K1 6= \u2205, then e is the vertex in the subcomplex K1a .\nProof. By the definition for each vertex e \u2208 t we have K a e \u2282 K1a , if\n|t| \u2229 K1a 6= \u2205. Since simplexes s in K \u2217 form a disjoint covering of |K \u2217 |, then\nK \u2217 t \u2282 K \u2217 e.\n4.1.3. Definition. A subcomplex K1a of a complex K a is called complete,\nif s \u2282 K1a for each simpex s all vertexes of which are in K1a .\n4.1.4. Lemmas. Let K1a be a complete subcomplex of a complex K a .\n21\n\n\f(i). If K \u2217 is a pj -subdivision of a complex K a , then a pj -subdivision K1\u2217 of\nthe subcomplex K1a induced by K \u2217 is the complete subcomplex of the complex\nK \u2217.\n(ii). If f : N a \u2192 K a is a simplexial mapping, then f \u22121 K1a is a complete\nsubcomplex of the complex N a .\nProof. (i). If \u03c4 is a simplex in K a , then \u03c4 \u2229 K1a is a verge (may be\nvoid) of the simplex \u03c4 . On the other hand, there exists embedding of K a\ninto c0 (L, w(|K a |)). Therefore, |K a | has a disjoint paving by clopen balls\nBl in c0 (L, w(|K a|)). For each simplex s in K \u2217 there exists a ball B in\nc0 (L, w(|K a |)) such that B \u2229 |K \u2217 | = s. Each pj -subdivision of the simplex \u03c4\nin K a consists of a disjoint union of simplexes si in K \u2217 .\n(ii). If \u03c4 is a simplex in N a , then f |\u03c4 is an affine mapping, hence f (\u03c4 )\nis a disjoint union of simplexes from K1a . Therefore, f \u22121 (f (\u03c4 )) is covered by\ndisjoint family of simplexes from N a . The same is true for verges of simplexes\nfrom N a .\n4.1.5. Note. In view of Lemmas 4.1.4 above Propositions I.1.3 and I.1.5\nfrom [12] are true also in the non-Archimedean case.\n4.1.6. Definition. Subcomplexes K1a and K2a of a complex K a are called\nadjacent, if K1 = K \\ K a K2 and K2 = K \\ K a K1 .\n4.1.7. Lemma. Adjacent subcomplexes K1a and K2a of a complex K a are\ncomplete subcomplexes.\nProof. If \u03c4 is a simplex or a verge of a simplex in K a , then either \u03c4 \u2282 K1a\nor \u03c4 \u2282 K2a and K1a \u2229 K2a = \u2205.\n4.1.8. Definition. For complexes K1a and K2a their join K1a \u25e6 K2a is\ndefined in the corresponding Banach subspace Z of c0 (L, A1 )\u2295c0 (L, A2 )\u2295L =\nc0 (L, A1 + A2 + 1) with card(Aj ) = w(Kja ) analogously to the classical case\nwith substitution of {x : 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1} = [0, 1]R \u2282 R into B(L, 0, 1) =\n[0, 1] \u2282 L, where j = 1 or j = 2. Each simplexes \u03c41 in K1a and \u03c42 in K2a are\ncharacterized completely by their vertexes. Then each simplex \u03c4 in K1a \u25e6 K2a\nhas a set of vertexes \u039b\u03c4 , which is a union of sets \u039b\u03c4j of vertexes of the\ncorresponding simplexes \u03c4j in Kja , where j = 1 or j = 2. When K1a \u2229 K2a = \u2205,\nthen Z = c0 (L, A1 + A2 + 1). In general Z = cl[spL (K1 \u222a K2 )].\n4.1.9. Lemma. K1a and K2a are adjacent subcomplexes of a complex K a\nif and only if each simplex \u03c4 of a complex K a has the form\n(i) \u03c4 = \u03c41 \u25e6 \u03c42 , where \u03c4j are simplexes in Kja , \u03c41 \u2229 \u03c42 = \u2205, j = 1 or j = 2.\nProof. If subcomplexes are adjacent, then \u03c41 \u25e6 \u03c42 is obtained by junction\nof each pair of points v1 \u2208 \u03c41 and v2 \u2208 \u03c42 by a segment [v1 , v2 ] in the sense of\n22\n\n\f\u00a72.8.(2).(iii). On the other hand, equation (i) is equivalent to \u039b\u03c41 \u2229 \u039b\u03c42 = \u2205.\nThe last equation for each pair of \u03c41 in K1a and \u03c42 in K2a implies that these\nsubcomplexes are adjacent.\n4.1.10. Note. In view of Lemma 4.1.9 above Propositions I.1.10 and\nI.1.11 from [12] are true also in the non-Archimedean case.\n4.1.11. Definition and Note. Let K1a and K2a be adjacent subcomplexes of a complex K a and K1\u2217 be a pj -subdivision of a complex K1a . For\neach simplex \u03c41 of a complex K1a let \u03c41\u2217 denotes be its pj -subdivision induced\nby K1\u2217 . For each simplex \u03c4 in K a let \u03c4 \u2217 = \u03c41\u2217 \u25e6 \u03c42 , where \u03c41 = \u03c4 \u2229 K1a ,\n\u03c42 = \u03c4 \u2229 K2a . Then the union SdK1\u2217 K a of complexes \u03c4 \u2217 for all simplexes \u03c4 of\nK a is a subdivision of a complex K a . This gives possibility to consider more\ngeneral subdivisions than pj -subdivisions.\nEvidently, analogs of Propositions I.1.12, I.1.13 and I.1.15 from [12] are\ntrue in the non-Archimedean case. The subdivision SdK1\u2217 K a of the complex\nK a is called the minimal continuation of a pj -subdivision K1\u2217 of a complete\nsubcomplex K1a of the complex K a .\n4.1.12. Lemma. SdK1\u2217 K a = K2a \u222a SdK1\u2217 (K a K1a ), where K a K1a is a\nclopen star of the subcomplex K1a .\nProof. K \\ (K1 \u222a K2 ) is an intersection of clopen stars of complexes K1a\nand K2a .\n4.1.13. Definitions and Notes. A mapping h : K \u2192 N is called linear\nrelative to complexes K a and N a , if it is simplexial for the corresponding\npolyhedra. Since K a S is the least clopen subcomplex of a complex K a containing a subset S \u2282 K, then K a S \u2282 h\u22121 (N a h(S)), that is equivalent to\nh(K a S) \u2282 N a h(S). For each mapping f : X \u2192 K a by \u03c9f K a is denoted\na covering of a space X by f \u22121 K a e, where K a e are called main stars for\nvertexes e in K a . Let < N a , K a >f denotes a subcomplex of a join N a \u25e6 K a\nof the complexes N a and K a such that its simplexes are simplexes of N a and\nK a and also f (\u03c4 ) \u25e6 \u03c4 and all its verges, where \u03c4 is a simplex of the complex\nK a . Then < N a , K a >f is called a cylinder of the simplexial mapping f .\nThere exists a retraction f \u0303 :< N a , K a >f \u2192 N a such that f \u0303(x) = x for each\nx \u2208 N, f \u0303(x) = f (x) for each x \u2208 K. Evidently, Propositions I.2.1, I.2.4-10\nfrom [12] are true in the non-Archimedean case also.\n4.1.14. Lemma. dimL < N a , K a >f = max(dimL N a , dimL f (K a ) +\ndimL K a + 1).\nProof. dimL f (\u03c4 ) \u25e6 \u03c4 \u2264 dimL f (\u03c4 ) + dimL \u03c4 + 1 for each simplex \u03c4 in K a .\n\n23\n\n\f4.2.1. Definitions and Notes. A polyhedral spectrum {Xi ; fji ; N}\nis called standard if it satisfies conditions S.1, S.3, S.4 from [12] and the\nfollowing condition:\na\nS.2 fii+1 is a simplexial mapping of a complex Xi+1\nonto a normal subj\ndivision (that is a p -subdivision with the corresponding j \u2208 N) Xi\u2217 of a\ncomplex Xia for each i \u2208 N such that\n(i) limj\u2192\u221e sup\u03c4 \u2282Xja diam(fij (\u03c4 )) = 0, where \u03c4 are simplexes in Xja . The\ncomplex K a is called uniform if the corresponding to it polyhedra over L is\nuniform.\nAn approximation of all subsets Y of an arbitrary ultrauniform space X\nsimultaneously by one spectrum {X\u03b1 ; f\u03b2\u03b1 ; U} is called absolute, that is for\neach Y \u2282 X there exists UY \u2282 U such that Y = lim{X\u03b1 ; f\u03b2\u03b1 ; U} and for each\nY \u2032 \u2282 Y the following inclusion UY \u2032 \u2282 UY is satisfied.

A polyhedral spectrum is called\n(c) non-degenerate if f\u03b2\u03b1 are non-degenerate, that is for each simplex s in\nX\u03b1 restrictions f\u03b2\u03b1 |s are simplexial and dimL f\u03b2\u03b1 (s) = dimL s.\nNotations and propositions from \u00a7\u00a7II.1-II.10 [12] are transferable onto the\nnon-Archimedean case due to above results and definitions with the substi\u2217\ntution of barycentric subdivisions onto pj -subdivisions (see for example, \u03c4s+1\nin \u00a7II.1.11 [12]).\nLet Kic be defined as in \u00a7II.3.1 [12]. For two families Y c and Y1c of simplexes from K1c a mapping h : Y \u2192 Y1 is called c-linear over the field L,\na\nif for each simplex \u03c4 from Y c (that is from some subcomplex Y c \u2229 Ki,i+1\n,\nwhere i \u2208 N) there exists q \u2208 N such that h(\u03c4 ) \u2282 Kq,q+1 and the mapping h|\u03c4 is simplexial. In view of II.4.7 [12] {K1,i ; hj,i ; N} is an inverse\nspectrum, its limit space is denoted N K and it is called the cone of the\nspectrum {K1,i ; hj,i ; N}.

Propositions analogous to II.1.9, II.7.18,19,\nII.9.22 [12] follow from Lemma 4.1.9 above.\n4.2.2. Lemma. dimL (X\u03b1 \u2229 Ki\u22121,i ) \u2264 dimL \u03b1(i).\nProof. In view of \u00a7II.7.13 [12] we have X\u03b1 \u2229 Ki\u22121,i = X\u03b1,i \u2229 Ki\u22121,i .\na\na\na\nLet M\u03b1,i\nbe a subcomplex of a complex Ki\u22121,i\nsuch that M\u03b1,i\nis a union\nof simplexes \u03c3 \u25e6 fi,i\u22121 (\u03c3), where \u03c3 is a simplex of the complex Xia such that\na\na\nfi,i\u22121 (\u03c3) \u2282 Xi\u22121 \\ \u03b1\u03031 (i\u22122).

For each simplex s we have dimL s = card(As ), where\ncl(spL s) = c0 (L, As ), the closure is taken in the corresponding Banach space\nc0 (L, A) in which the complex is contained, spL s denotes the L-linear span\nof s.\n4.2.3.

For i = 1 the mapping h1,\u03b1 is identical for each \u03b1 \u2208 U in accordance with \u00a7II.9.7 [12], hence it satisfies Conditions (1 \u2212 4). Let hi,\u03b1\nsatisfies Conditions (1 \u2212 4) for each i \u2264 n. Then hn+1,\u03b1 is defined by\nConditions (2 \u2212 4). Moreover, \u03b1(n) and \u03b1\u03031 (n) may be taken clopen in\nXn and D1 := h\u22121\nn+1,n (\u03b1(n)) are clopen in Xn+1 , then D1 and D2 := K1,n\nand D3 := M\u03b1,n+1 are closed in K1,n+1 . For each simplex \u03c4 \u2282 K1,n+1 each\npoint x \u2208 \u03c4 has the form x = a1 x1 + a2 x2 + a3 x3 , where aj \u2208 B(L, 0, 1),\nxj \u2208 Dj . Let g : c0 \u2295 c0 \u2295 c0 \u2192 c0 be the mapping of evaluation, that is,\ng(x1 , x2 , x3 ) = x1 + x2 + x3 , hj : Dj \u2192 K1,n+1 are continuous mappings, so\nhn+1,\u03b1 (x) = (g(a1h1 (x1 ), a2 h2 (x2 ), a3 h3 (x3 )) is continuous. If to consider uniform polyhedra, then the simplexial mappings f : K a \u2192 N a are considered as\nuniformly continuous. Then to the cylinder < N a , K a >f it corresponds the\na\n\u2217\nc\nuniform polyhedron, since f (K) = N. Then Ki,j\n, Xja , Xi\u2217 , Ki,j\nand Ki,j\nfrom\na\n\u2217\n\u00a7II.1 in [12] correspond the uniform polyhedra over L, since Ki,j = SdXj \u2217Ki,j\nand inf (V \u2229W =\u2205,V and W are simplexes from K \u2217 ) dist(V, W ) > 0. For T =\ni,j\nS\nKi = j\u2208N Kj,j+1, Kic , K\u03b1c and X\u03b1c the latter condition may be not satisfied,\nbut sup(V is simplex from T ) diam(V ) < \u221e. At the same time T is not necessarily complete, since it is not necessarily ANRU. If fj,i = fij : Xj \u2192 Xi ,\n25\n\n\ffj : N X \u2192 Xi are non-stretching (uniformly continuous), then hj,i from\n\u00a7II.4 and hi from \u00a7II.5 in [12] are also non-stretching (uniformly continuous\nrespectively). Then from h1,\u03b1 = id and (1 \u2212 4) with induction by j for each\n\u03b1 it follows that hj,\u03b1 are non-stretching (uniformly continuous correspondingly). From this it follows that the mappings h\u03b1 from \u00a7II.10 and hence\nalso f\u03b1,\u03b2 and f\u03b1 from \u00a7II.11 and \u00a7II.9.27 [12] are non-stretching (uniformly\ncontinuous respectively).\n4.2.4. Lemma. For each open covering V of W which is a clopen subset\nin a limit limj {Xj , fij , N} =: N X of an inverse sequence of polyhedra there\nare \u03b1 \u2208 U such that W\u03b1 = W and a clopen covering wf\u03b1 X\u03b1\u2217 \u2282 {f\u03b1\u22121 (X\u03b1\u2217 q) : q}\nof W\u03b1 by f\u03b1\u22121 (X\u03b1\u2217 q) of the main stars X\u03b1\u2217 q of the complex X\u03b1\u2217 is refined into\nV.\nProof. Let \u03b1a (i) be a subcomplex of a complex Xia such that a simplex\n\u03c3 of a complex Xia is a simplex of a complex \u03b1a (i) if and only if fi\u22121 (Xia e)\nis contained in the corresponding element U(e) of a covering V for each its\nvertex e. Then \u03b1a (i) is a complete subcomplex of a complex Xia . That for a\nsequence \u03b1(i) to verify condition\n(A) \u03b1\u03031 (i) \u2282 \u03b1(i + 1) for each i \u2208 N as in \u00a7II.11.20 [12] it is sufficient\nto mention that Xi\u2217 is the pj -subdivision of the complex Xia with j \u2265 1, so\nXia \u03c4 \u2282 Xia q for some vertex q \u2208 Xia . In this case the main stars are clopen,\nhence wf\u03b1 X\u03b1\u2217 is the clopen covering. If {qj : j = 0, 1, 2, ...} are vertexes from\nXia stars of which contain fi (x), then there is a clopen simplex \u03c4 \u2282 Xia with\nsuch vertexes and fi (x) \u2208 \u03c4 . At the same time the star St(qj , wfi Xia ) with\neach qj is contained in V , consequently, \u03c4 \u2282 \u03b1a (i) and fi\u22121 (\u03b1(i)) is clopen in\n\u2217\na\nW\u03b1 . Each pj -subdivision Xi\u22121\nof a complex Xi\u22121\nis proper for each j \u2208 N,\n\u2217\na\na\nconsequently, Xi\u22121 \u03c3 \u2282 Xi\u22121 q for some suitable vertex q in the complex Xi\u22121\n,\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nwhere \u03c3 is the simplex in Xi\u22121 . Therefore, hi\u22121 (X\u03b1 e) \u2282 Xi\u22121 q, where q\nis a vertex of the complex \u03b1a (i \u2212 1). Since f\u03b1\u22121 (X\u03b1\u2217 q) contains the clopen\nsubcovering, then W\u03b1 is clopen and W\u03b1 = W . In the case of separable\nf\u03b1\u22121 (X\u03b1\u2217 q) this subcovering can be chosen disjoint due to ultrametrizability\nof f\u03b1\u22121 (X\u03b1\u2217 q) (see Theorem 7.3.3 in [3]).\nVice versa, let x \u2208 W and x \u2208 U \u2208 V . Coverings \u03c9fi X\u03b1\u2217 satisfy Condition\n4.2.1.(i) such that St(x, \u03c9fi Xia ) \u2282 U. Let {ej : j \u2208 \u039bi,x } be vertexes of the\ncomplex Xia , stars of which contain the point fi (x). Then fi (x) \u2208 \u03c4 , where\n\u03c4 is a clopen simplex of a complex Xia with the described above vertexes.\nSince fi\u22121 (Xia ej ) \u2282 U for each j \u2208 \u039bi,x , then \u03c4 is the simplex in the complex\n\u03b1a (i). Therefore, x \u2208 fi\u22121 (\u03c4 ) \u2282 fi\u22121 (\u03b1(i)) \u2282 V\u03b1 , hence W = V\u03b1 .\n26\n\n\f4.2.5. Lemma. If Y \u2282 N X, fi (Y ) = X, fij : Xj \u2192 Xi are irreducible\nmappings for each j \u2265 i \u2208 N, then f\u03b1\u03b2 : X\u03b2\u2217 \u2192 X\u03b1\u2217 are irreducible and\nf\u03b1 (Y \u2229 V\u03b1 ) = X\u03b1\u2217 for each \u03b1 \u2208 U and Y is dense in N X. If fi are irreducible\nfor each i, then f\u03b1 are irreducible for each \u03b1 \u2208 U.\nProof. From irredicibility of fij and Lemma 3.5 it follows that for each\n(clopen) simplex \u03c4 \u2282 Xia the mapping fij |(f j )\u22121 (\u03c4 )\u2282Xj is essential. Let \u03b2 \u2208 U\ni\nand t be a simplex in the complex X\u03b2\u2217 , then there exists some pj -subdivision\na\nc\n\u03c3 \u2217 of the simplex \u03c3 from Ki\u22121,i\n\u2229 X\u03b2,i\nand there exists a simplex \u03c4 from\nM\u03b1,i \u2229\u03b1(i) such that \u03c3 = hi,\u03b1 (\u03c4 ) and t is a simplex from \u03c3 \u2217 . From \u00a7II.3.2,10.2\n(c-linearity of h\u03b1 : K1 \u2192 K1 ), \u00a7II.7.1.4,7.15 and \u00a7II.4 (f\u03b2,\u03b1 = h\u03b1 |X\u03b2 , X\u03b1 =\nS\nc\nc\nc\n\u03b2\ni\u2208N X\u03b1,i , X\u03b1,i = X\u03b1 \u2229 K1,i ) it follows that f\u03b1 = f\u03b2,\u03b1 is irreducible due\nto Lemmas 3.4 and 3.5, since h\u03b1 is essential on t \u2282 X\u03b2 . Indeed, due to\nII.4.9 we have hj,i = fj,i for x \u2208 Xj and j \u2265 i. In view of II.10.3 we have\nh\u03b1 (x) = hi,\u03b1 (x) for x \u2208 K1,\u03b1 . In view of II.9.1 we have h\u03b1 (x) : K1,i \u2192 K1,i\nis c-linear and h1,\u03b1 = id, in addition, by II.9.3 hi,\u03b1 (x) = hi\u22121,\u03b1 \u25e6 hi,i\u22121 (x)\n1\nfor x \u2208 h\u22121\ni,i\u22121 (\u03b1(i \u2212 1)), by II.9.4 hi,\u03b1 (x) = x for x \u2208 Xi \\ \u03b1\u0303 (i \u2212 1), also\na\na\n\u03b1\u03031 (i) = Xi+1\n\u03b11 (i) is the clopen star relative to the complex Xi+1\n, where \u03b11 (i)\na\nis the clopen subcomplex (and the subpolyhedron as the subspace) in Xi+1\n,\n1\n1\nconsequently, we can suppose that \u03b1\u0303 (i) = \u03b1 (i) in this non-Archimedean\ncase. The rest of the statements of this Lemma follows from \u00a7II.11.22 in [12].\n4.2.6. Definition. A mapping f : X \u2192 K a into a simplexial complex\nK a is called locally finite, if each x \u2208 X has a neighbourhood U such that\nf (U) is contained in a finite subcomplex (that is the subcomplex consisting\nof finite number of simplexes and their verges) of a complex K a .\n4.2.7. Lemma. If all mappings fi : N X \u2192 Xi are locally finite and Xi\nare locally finite-dimensional over L, then all mappings f\u03b1 : V\u03b1 \u2192 X\u03b1\u2217 are\nlocally finite.\nProof. Since Xi are locally finite-dimensional over L, then each its pj subdivision is also locally finite-dimensional over L, hence Xi\u2217 and X\u03b1c are\nlocally finite-dimensional over L, since L is locally compact. For x \u2208 V\u03b1\nS\n\u22121\n1\nand \u03b1 \u2208 U we have x \u2208 f \u22121 (\u03b1\u03031 (i)), since V\u03b1 = \u221e\ni=1 fi+1 (\u03b1\u0303 (i)). If W is a\nneighbourhood of x such that fi+1 (W ) is a finite subcomplex P a of a complex\n\u22121\na\nXi+1\n. Taking W \u2282 fi+1\n(\u03b1(i+ 1)), then P \u2282 \u03b1(i+ 1). Since h\u03b1 is c-linear over\nL, then h\u03b1 (P ) is contained in a finite number of simplexes from X\u03b1c , hence in\na finite number of simplexes of its subdivision X\u03b1\u2217 , hence f\u03b1 is locally finite,\nsince f\u03b1 |f \u22121 (\u03b1(i+1)) = h\u03b1 fi+1 |f \u22121 (\u03b1(i+1)) due to Propositions II.10.4 and II.11.3\ni+1\n\ni+1\n\n27\n\n\f[12].\n4.2.8. Lemma. If all Xi are finite-dimensional dim(Xi ) < \u221e, then\nthe complexes X\u03b1 can be chosen locally finite and such that dimL (X\u03b1 ) \u2264\nsupi\u2208N dimL Xi .\nProof. This follows from Theorems 3.1, 3.18, since complexes K1 for\neach Yj can be chosen locally finite and X\u03b1 \u2282 K1 . The second statement\nfollows from Lemma 4.2.2.\n4.2.9. Theorem. Each ultrauniform space (X, P) has an irreducible\nabsolute normal and uniform from above polyhedral representation\nT := {X\u03b2 , f\u03b2\u03b1 , U}\nover L, that is, for each Y \u2282 (X\u0303, P) there exists an ordered subset UY \u2282 U\nsuch that there exists an uniform isomorphism\nY\n\nf : Y \u2192 lim{X\u03b2 , f\u03b1\u03b2 , UY }\n\n(that is Y f is a bijective surjective mapping, Y f and Y f \u22121 are uniformly\ncontinuous). Moreover, as an absolute polyhedral expansion T (not necessarily uniform such that X is homeomorphic with lim T ) may be chosen locally\nfinite-dimensional X\u03b2 over the field L. If dim(X) = k, then there exists\nk-dimensional T over L and\n{X\u03b2 , f\u03b2\u03b1 , UX }\nis non-degenerate (and irreducible for complete X) such that there exists a\nhomeomorphism\ng : X \u2192 lim{X\u03b2 , f\u03b2\u03b1 , UX }\nwith irreducible surjective mappings g\u03b1 := f\u03b1 \u25e6 g.\nProof. Let S = {Xj , fij } be an inverse polyhedral sequence over L.\nThen sections X\u03b1 and bonding mappings f\u03b1\u03b2 for \u03b2 \u2265 \u03b1 \u2208 U form the inverse\nmapping system\nR = {X\u03b2 , f\u03b1\u03b2 , U}\nthat is an expansion of S and the absolute polyhedral expansion for X =\nlim S. If Xi are uniform polyhedra and fij are non-stretching (or uniformly\ncontinuous) irreducible simplexial mappings for each j \u2265 i \u2208 N, then the\nsame is true for f\u03b1\u03b2 for each \u03b2 \u2265 \u03b1 \u2208 U. From Theorem 3.18, Lemmas\n28\n\n\fand Notes 4.1.1-4.2.8 above and \u00a7II.12 in [12] it follows the existence of the\nhomeomorphism\nY\nf : lim{X\u03b2 , f\u03b1\u03b2 , UY } \u2192 Y\nsuch that Y f is uniformly continuous, since f\u03b1\u03b2 and f\u03b1 are non-stretching.\nFrom Lemma 3.17 it follows that Y f is the uniform embedding, since\nlim\n\ni\u2192\u221e\n\n(s\n\nsup\nare simplexes from\n\ndiam(s) = 0\nXia )\n\nand due to the consideration of the sequence {\u03b1(j) : j \u2265 i} = \u03b1. Indeed, the\ncorresponding X\u03b1 has the cofinal subset E \u2282 UY such that for each b > 0\nthe set {\u03b1 : sup(s are simplexes from X\u03b1 ) diam(s) > b is finite and V\u03b1 =\nT\nN\nh\u22121\nX and Y = \u03b1\u2208UY V\u03b1 , so that Y f \u22121 is uniformly continuous.\n\u03b1 (X\u03b1 ) \u2229\nEach ultrametric space (X, \u03c1) has the topological embedding into B(L, 0, 1)w(X)\nand into D w(X) which are compact (see \u00a76.2.16 in [3]). In particular, the separable space X has the embedding into B(L, 0, 1)q for each q \u2208 N and for\nq = \u05d00 , but not uniformly in general, for example, c0 (L, N) is complete, but\nit is not compact. From this the last statement of the Theorem follows. That\nis, for the polyhedral expansions reproducing the uniformity up to an isomorphism with the initial ultrauniform space in general infinite-dimensioanl over\nL polyhedra may be necessary and sup\u03b2 dimL X\u03b2 \u2264 w(X). For the polyhedral expansion reproducing X up to a (topological) homeomorphism locally\nfinite-dimensional X\u03b2 are sufficient, that is for each x \u2208 X\u03b2 there exists a\nclopen simplex s in X\u03b2 such that x \u2208 s and dimL s < \u05d00 , since Lw(X) is a\nlimit of an inverse system of finite-dimensional polyhedra over L. In view of\nLemma 2.5 it is sufficient to take U with card(U) \u2264 \u05d00 card(P\u2032)2w(X) , where\nP\u2032 is a subfamily of P of minimal cardinality, which generate the same uniformity in X, since sections X\u03b1 of the spectrum for each ultrametric space\nYj are spaces of X\u03b1c for Yj , where X\u03b1c is a collection of simplexes s from\nS\nS\u221e\n1\na\nK1c = \u221e\nq=1 Kq,q+1 such that all vertexes of s are in\nq=1 (\u03b1(q) \\ \u03b1\u0303 (q \u2212 1)). If\ncard(X) \u2265 \u05d00 , then \u05d00 card(P\u2032 )2w(X) = 2w(X) , since 2w(X) > \u05d00 card(P\u2032 ).\nIf dim(X) = k, then by Theorem 3.18 there exists k-dimensional over\nL inverse mapping system S associated with coverings of order k. For\ndim(X) = \u221e we can use orders of coverings as cardinals equal to k \u2265 \u05d00\nn\nand as follows from results above bonding mappings fm\nand polyhedra Pm\ncan be chosen such that there exists m \u2208 UX with dimL Pm = k. The final\npart of the proof is analogous to that of Theorem 12.21 [12].\n29\n\n\f4.2.10. Corollary. If in a complete ultrauniform space (X, P) a subspace R is compact and each closed subset G, G \u2282 X \\ R is such that G\nmay be uniformly embedded into B(Ln , 0, 1) with n = n(G) \u2208 N, then X is\nuniformly isomorphic with lim S, where S = {Pm , fnm , E} is an irreducible\nnormal inverse mapping system and Pm are uniform finite-dimensional over\nL polyhedra.\nProof. For X\u03c1 \\ R\u03c1 there is a sequence of closed subsets G\u03c1 (k) with\nS\nk\u2208N G\u03c1 (k) = X\u03c1 \\ R\u03c1 and uniform clopen neighbourhoods G\u03c1 (k) \u2282 U\u03c1 (k) \u2282\nB(Ln , 0, rn ), n = n(G\u03c1 (k)) such that there exists a uniformly continuous\nretraction rk,\u03c1 : U\u03c1 (k) \u2192 G\u03c1 (k) and a family\nb\u03c1,k := sup\n\ninf\n\ny\u2208U\u03c1 (k) x\u2208G\u03c1 (k)\n\n\u03c1(x, y)\n\nsatisfying conditions of Lemma 3.17. From R\u03c1 \u2282 B(Ln , 0, 1) and the existence of the family {U\u03c1 (k)} such that lim{U\u03c1 (k); f\u03c1\u03c1,k\n\u2032 ,k \u2032 , F } = X \\ Int(R) for\nsome directed F \u2282 P \u00d7 N it follows the existence of the inverse spectra S.\nIndeed, f\u03c1,k may be extended on R \\ Int(R) and compacts f\u03c1,k (R \\ Int(R))\nmay be uniformly embedded into U\u03c1 (k), and spectra for R and X \\ Int(R)\nmay be done consistent on R \\ Int(R) that to get S for X (see also Lemmas\n3.2, 3.3.1).\n4.2.11. Note. In view of Theorem 1.7 in [7] an incomplete uniform space\n(X, P) is not ANRU, hence in S in general polyhedra X\u03b1 are incomplete, for\nexample, X\u03b1 = Q \u00d7 B(L, 0, 1) in L2 .\n4.3. Theorem. Let G be a locally compact group with a left ultrauniformity P and X is closed in G. Then X is uniformly isomorphic with\na limit of an inverse mapping system lim S and Pm are finite-dimensional\nuniform polyhedra over L of an irreducible normal inverse mapping system\nS = {Pm , fnm , E}.\nProof. Let V be a compact clopen neighbourhood of the unit element e \u2208\nG, P be the family of the left -invariant ultrapseudometrics in G (\u03c1(yx, yz) =\n\u03c1(x, z) for each x, y, z \u2208 G and \u03c1 \u2208 P, see [3, 11]). That is V = {x \u2208 G :\n\u03c1(x, e) \u2264 b} for some \u03c1 \u2208 P and b \u2208 \u0393L . The closed subgroup H\u03c1 := {x \u2208\nG : \u03c1(x, e) = 0} defines the equivalence relation T\u03c1 in G: gT\u03c1 h, if h\u22121 g \u2208 H\u03c1 ,\nsince the left classes hH\u03c1 are either disjoint or coinside. Therefore, there\nexists the uniformly continuous quotient mapping \u03c0\u03c1 : G \u2192 G\u03c1 := G/T\u03c1 , in\naddition V \u2283 H\u03c1 and V H\u03c1 = V . From the compactness of V /T\u03c1 =: V\u03c1 it\nfollows that G\u03c1 is a locally compact ultrametric space. From the completeness\n30\n\n\fof X it follows that X\u03c1 is closed in G\u03c1 \u0592\u2192 c0 (L, A\u03c1 ) with card(A\u03c1 ) = w(G\u03c1 ).\nTherefore, X \u2229 V has due to Theorem 3.18 the finite-dimensional over L\npolyhedral expansion. In G there is a family M of elements such that gV \u2229\nS\nhV = \u2205 for each g 6= h \u2208 M and G = g\u2208M gV . If g 6= h \u2208 M, then \u03c1(g, h) >\nb, since from \u03c1(g, h) \u2264 b it would follow that \u03c1(gV, hV ) \u2264 b and gV \u2229hV 6= \u2205,\nthat contradicts the definition of M. Then Y (g) \u2229 Y (h) = \u2205 for g 6= h \u2208 M\nL\nL\nwith Y (g) := \u03c0\u03c1 (gV ) and G\u03c1 = g\u2208M Y (g) and X\u03c1 = g\u2208M X\u03c1 \u2229Y (g). From\nthis the statement of the Theorem follows.\n4.4. Theorem. An ultrauniform space (X, P) is homeomorphic with\nlim S with \u010cech-complete finite-dimensional over L polyhedra Pm and an\nirreducible inverse mapping system S = {Pm , fnm , F } if and only if X is\n\u010cech-complete.\nProof. At first we verify that for (X, P) the condition of \u010cech-completeness\nis equivalent with the L-completeness. The latter means that X has the embedding as the closed subspace into L\u03c4 , where card(\u03c4 ) \u2264 w(X). If X is\nL-complete, then X has the embedding as the closed subspace into R\u03c4 , since\nL is Lindel\u00f6f and X is \u010cech-complete due to \u00a73.11.3, 3.11.6 and 3.11.12 in\n[3].\nTo prove the reverse statement we verify that the L-completeness is equivalent to the satisfaction of the following conditions: there is not any Tychonoff space Y for which\n(LC1) there is the homeomorphic embedding r : X \u2192 Y with r(X) 6=\ncl(r(X)) = Y and\n(LC2) for each continuous function f : X \u2192 L there is a continuous\nfunction g : Y \u2192 L such that g \u25e6 r = f . Evidently, that it is sufficient to\nconsider the case of ultrametrizable X. For such X the family of continuous\nf : X \u2192 L separates points x \u2208 X and closed subsets C for which x \u2208\n/ C,\nfor example, f (x) = \u03c1(x, C) = inf y\u2208C \u03c1(x, y). Then substituting R on L in\nthe proof of Theorem 3.11.3 [3] we get the desired statement.\nThere is a continuous function h : L \u2192 R with h(L) = R and for each\ncontinuous q : X \u2192 R there is a continuous function t : X \u2192 L such that\nh \u25e6 t = q. The latter is sufficient to verify for (X, \u03c1), since for (X, P) this\nstatement may be obtained with the limits of the inverse system. For (X, \u03c1)\nand each bn > 0 there exists a locally constant tn : X \u2192 L such that h \u25e6 tn\nand q are bn -close, since (X, \u03c1) is the disjoint union of clopen subsets Y (j)\nwith supj diam(f (Y (j)) \u2264 b, h\u22121 (Y (j)) \u2282 L, h\u22121 (Y (j)) \u2229 h\u22121 (Y (i)) = \u2205 for\ni 6= j. Therefore, there exists a sequence {tn : n \u2208 N} giving the desired\n31\n\n\ft = limn\u2192\u221e tn , where limn\u2192\u221e bn = 0. Let (X, P) is \u010chech-complete and not\nL-complete, then there would be a homeomorphic embedding r : X \u2192 Y\nwith r(X) 6= cl(r(X)) = Y and for each continuous function f : X \u2192 L\nthere is a continuous function g : Y \u2192 L with g \u25e6 r = f . Consequently,\neach continuous function q : X \u2192 R has continuous functions t : X \u2192 L\nand g : Y \u2192 L with g \u25e6 r = t and h \u25e6 g \u25e6 r = h \u25e6 t = q, that contradicts\n\u010chech-completeness of X.\nIf X is homeomorphic with lim S, then X is \u010chech-complete, since each\nPm is Lindel\u00f6f and \u010chech-complete.\nIf X is \u010chech-complete, then X is homeomorphic with lim{X\u03b1 , g\u03b2\u03b1, E},\nwhere each X\u03b1 is locally compact and has the embedding into Ln(\u03b1) as the\nclopen subspace, where n(\u03b1) \u2208 N (see also Corollary 5 from Theorem 9 in\n[20] and Proposition 3.2.17 in [4]). From Theorems 3.18 and 4.9 it follows\nthat X is homeomorphic with lim S, where Pm are finite-dimensional over L\npolyhedra.\n\n5\n\nPolyhedral expansions and relations between\nultrauniform and uniform spaces.\n\n5.1. Theorem. For each ultrauniform space (X, U) there exists a uniform\nlocally connected space (Y, V) and a continuous quotient mapping \u03b8 : X \u2192 Y\nsuch that\n(i) \u03b8(X) = Y , d(X) = d(Y ), w(X) = w(Y );\n(ii) if X is dense in itself, then Y is dense in itself;\nL\nL\n(iii) if X = j Xj , then Y = j Yj ;\n(iv) there exist natural compactifications cX and c\u03b8 Y such that \u03b8 has a\ncontinuous extension on cX and \u03b8(cX) = c\u03b8 Y ;\n(v) if Z is a subspace of X, then there exists a subspace W of Y such that\nCondition (i) is satisfied for Z and W instead of X and Y ;\n(vi) if X has a n-dimensional polyhedral expansion over L, then Y has a\nn-dimensional polyhedral expansion over R.\nProof. In view of Theorem 2.3.24 [3] the Cantor cube D m has the\nQ\nweight m, where D is the two-point discrete set, D m = s\u2208S Ds , card(S) =\nm, Ds = D for each s \u2208 S. In view of Corollary 6.2 [3] for each nonArchimedean infinite locally compact field L with a non-trivial valuation a\n32\n\n\fball B(L, x, r) := {y \u2208 L : |x\u2212y| \u2264 r} is homeomorphic to D \u05d00 . On the other\nhand, there exists a well-known quotient mapping of D \u05d00 onto [0, 1]. It can be\nalso realized for B(L, 0, 1) and in particular for Zp := B(Qp , 0, 1), where p is a\nprime. Let s be a unit ball in c0 (L, \u03b1) and \u03b8 : B(L, 0, 1) \u2192 [0, 1] be a quotient\nmapping. Then this mapping generates a mapping \u03b8 : s \u2192 \u03b8(s) \u2282 c0 (R, \u03b1),\nwhere \u03b8(s) = {y \u2208 \u03b8(x) : x = (xj : j \u2208 \u03b1), |xj | \u2264 1, x \u2208 c0 (L, \u03b1)}, hence\n(y j : j \u2208 \u03b1) = y, y j = \u03b8(xj ) and for each \u01eb > 0 we have card{j : |xj | >\n\u01eb} < \u05d00 , hence card{j : |y j | > \u01eb} < \u05d00 such that y j \u2208 [0, 1]. If {ej : j \u2208 \u03b1}\nis the standard orthonormal basis in c0 (R, \u03b1), then under the embedding\nc0 (R, \u03b1) \u0592\u2192 c0 (R, \u03b1)\u2217 associated with this basis to each ej there corresponds\na continuous linear functional ej \u2208 c0 (R, \u03b1)\u2217, where c0 (R, \u03b1)\u2217 is a topological dual space, such that ej (ei ) = \u03b4ij . Therefore, \u03b8(s) = {y \u2208 c0 (R, \u03b1) :\n0 \u2264 ej (y) \u2264 1}, which is by definition a simplex in c0 (R, \u03b1) such that if\ny \u2208 \u03b8(s) and 0 < kyk < 1, then B(c0 (R, \u03b1), y, min(kyk, 1 \u2212 kyk)) \u2282 \u03b8(s).\nOn the other hand, if b is a simplex in c0 (R, \u03b1) and b \u2282 B(c0 (R, \u03b1), 0, 1),\nthen \u03b8\u22121 (Int(b)) is open in c0 (R, \u03b1), \u03b8\u22121 (Int(b)) 6= \u2205 if Int(b) 6= \u2205, since \u03b8\nis continuous. Choose \u03b1 such that b is a canonical closed subset in c0 (R, \u03b1),\nthen \u03b8\u22121 (b) is closed in c0 (L, \u03b1). Therefore, cl(\u03b8\u22121 (Int(b))) = \u03b8\u22121 (b), since\n\u03b8\u22121 (Int(b)) \u2282 \u03b8\u22121 (b) and if c is a canonical closed subset in [0, 1], then \u03b8\u22121 (c)\nis a canonical closed subset in D \u05d00 .\nIf X = lim{X\u03b1 , f\u03b2\u03b1 , E} is a spectral decomposition of an ultrauniform\nspace and X\u03b1 are polyhedra in c0 (L, \u03b3\u03b1 ), then \u03b8 generates \u03b8\u0303\u03b1 : X\u03b1 \u2192 \u03b8\u0303\u03b1 (X\u03b1 ),\nwhere \u03b8\u0303\u03b1 (X\u03b1 ) are polyhedra in c0 (R, \u03b3\u03b1), since each X\u03b1 can be presented as\na union of simplexes of diameter not greater, than 1. Then f \u0303\u03b2\u03b1 := \u03b8\u0303\u03b2 \u25e6 f\u03b2\u03b1 \u25e6\n\u03b8\u0303\u03b1\u22121 : \u03b8\u0303\u03b1 (X\u03b1 ) \u2192 \u03b8\u0303\u03b2 (X\u03b2 ) =: X\u0303\u03b2 are continuous bonding mappings. In view\nof Lemma 2.5.9 [3] the topological space \u03b8\u0303(X) = lim{X\u0303\u03b1 , f \u0303\u03b2\u03b1 , E} is locally\nconnected and \u03b8\u0303(X) is the quotient space of X.\nNow we proof that if X is given, then Y satisfies Conditions (i \u2212 vi).\nIn view of Proposition 2.5.6 [3] are satisfied (iii, v). On the other hand,\ndimL X\u03b1 = dimR X\u0303\u03b1 for each \u03b1 \u2208 E, consequently, (vi) is fulfilled. Since\nd(X\u03b1 ) = d(X\u0303\u03b1 ) and w(X\u03b1 ) = w(X\u0303\u03b1) for each \u03b1, then (i) is fulfilled. If x is\nan isolated point in X, then there exists \u03b1 \u2208 E such that x\u03b1 is an isolated\npoint of X\u03b1 , consequently, x\u0303\u03b1 is an isolated point of X\u0303\u03b1 .\nFor prooving (iv) we consider cX equal to some specific compactification\nc\u0303X\u0303 of X\u0303, where X\u0303 is a completion of the uniform space X. Therefore, the\nconsideration reduces to the case of a complete X. In such case X has\n33\n\n\fthe uniform polyhedral expansion such that conditions 2.8(i, ii) are satisfied.\nThen we take cX as lim{c\u03b1 X\u03b1 , f \u0304\u03b2\u03b1 , E}, where c\u03b1 X\u03b1 are compact spaces. Since\neach X\u03b1 is a uniform polyhedron we take c\u03b1 X\u03b1 as a topological sum of\ncompactifications of disjoint polyhedra s in X\u03b1 . Practically we take the\nBanaschewski compactification of each s [22]. If s = B(c0 (L, \u03b3\u03b1 ), x, r), then\nits Banaschewski compactification s\u03b6 is isomorphic with B(L, 0, 1)a , where\nL\na = 2\u03b3\u03b1 \u05d00 . Therefore, \u03b8\u0303\u03b1 has a continuous extension onto c\u03b1 X\u03b1 = s\u2208X\u03b1 c\u03b1 s.\nEvidently, \u03b8\u0303\u03b1 (s) = [0, 1]a is the Stone-\u010cech compactification of \u03b8\u0303(s).\nIt remains to prove statements about compactifications of simplexes. Let\nBco(s) denotes an algebra of clopen subsets of s. Instead of a ring homomorphism \u03b7 : Bco(s) \u2192 F2 in the Banaschewski construcion let us consider\na ring homomorphism \u03b7 : Bco(s) \u2192 Zp , where F2 is a finite field consisting of two elements. Topologically Zp is homeomorphic to F2 \u05d00 , where\na = cw(s) = 2\u03b3\u03b1 \u05d00 . The family \u03a9 of all such distinct \u03b7, which has \u03c3-additive\nextensions onto Bf (s) has the cardinality |\u03a9| = cw(s) , where w(s) = \u03b3\u03b1 \u05d00\nand Bf (s) denotes the Borel \u03c3-field of s, since |Zp | = c and each such \u03b7 is\ncharacterised by a countable family of atoms aj such that limj\u2192\u221e \u03b7(aj ) = 0\n(see Ch. 7 [22]). Therefore, s has an embedding into Zp a = F2 a . The family\n\u03a9 is a subfamily of a family \u03a5 of all ring homomorphisms \u03b7. Another way to\nrealize a totally disconnected compactification \u03b3s of s is in the consideration\nof the space H := Cb0 (s, Qp ) of bounded continuous functions f : s \u2192 Qp .\nTo each x \u2208 s there corresponds a continuous linear functional x\u2032 \u2208 H \u2217 such\nthat x\u2032 (f ) = f (x) and kx\u2032 k = 1 due to Hahn-Banach Theorem, since Qp\nis spherically complete, where H \u2217 denotes the Banach space of continuous\nlinear functionals on H. In view of Alaoglu-Bourbaki Theorem (see Exer.\n9.202 [19]) the unit ball U := B(H \u2217 , 0, 1) is \u03c3(H \u2217 , H)-compact. Therefore,\nthe closure \u03b3s of \u03b3(s) in U is compact, where \u03b3 is an embedding of s into\nU. From this construction we have \u03b3s = Zp a . From Example 9.3.3 [19]\nit follows that the Stone-\u010chech compactification of \u03b8(s) is equal to [0, 1]a .\nThen s\u03b6 = \u03b3s, since d(s\u03b6 ) = d(s) and due to Hewitt-Marczewski-Pondiczeri\nTheorem [3] Zap \u2282 s\u03b6 \u2282 Zap .\n5.2. Theorem. For each locally connected uniform space (Y, V) there\nexists an ultrauniform space (X, U) and a continuous quotient mapping \u03b8 :\nX \u2192 Y such that\n(i) \u03b8(X) = Y , d(X) = d(Y ), w(X) = w(Y );\n(ii) if Y is dense in itself, then X is dense in itself;\n\n34\n\n\fL\n\nL\n\n(iii) if Y = j Yj , then X = j Xj ;\n(iv) there exist natural compactifications cX and c\u03b8 Y such that \u03b8 has a\ncontinuous extension on cX and \u03b8(cX) = c\u03b8 Y ;\n(v) if Y has a n-dimensional polyhedral expansion over R, then X has a\nn-dimensional polyhedral expansion over L.\nProof. From the proof of Theorems 2.4 and 5.1 it follows that there exists\na topological embedding of Y into a subspace Z of H \u2217 , where H := C\u0303b0 (Y, R),\nsuch that Z is isomorphic with c0 (R, ord(Y )), where ord(Y ) is an ordinal\nassociated with Y , Z = cl(spR Y ), the closure of the linear span of Y over\nR is taken in H \u2217 (see also [3, 8, 15]). Therefore, polyhedra of a polyhedral\nexpansion of Y can be realized in Z. To each simplex q in c0 (R, ord(Y )) there\ncorresponds a simplex s in c0 (Qp , ord(Y )) such that q is a quotient space of\ns and dimR q = dimQp s. Let \u1ef8 be a completion of Y and Q\u03b1 be polyhedra\nof the polyhedral expansion of \u1ef8 . Then there are uniform polyhedra P\u03b1\nsuch that X\u0303 = lim{P\u03b1 , f\u03b2\u03b1 , E} and \u03b8\u0303(X\u0303) = lim{Q\u03b1 , f \u0303\u03b2\u03b1 , E} = \u1ef8 , where\nf \u0303\u03b2\u03b1 := \u03b8\u0303\u03b2 \u25e6 f\u03b2\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b8\u0303\u03b1\u22121 : and then analogously to the proof of Theorem 5.1 we\nget statements of Theorem 5.2, where X = \u03b8\u0303\u22121 (Y ).\n5.3. Corollary. Let spaces X and Y be infinite as in Theorems 5.1,\n5.2, then for absolute polyhedral expansions T = {P\u03b1 , f\u03b2\u03b1 , U} of X and S =\n{Q\u03b1 , g\u03b2\u03b1 , V} of Y there is equality card(U) = card(V).\nProof. In view of Theorems 5.1 and 5.2 to the inverse mapping system\nTX = {P\u03b1 , f\u03b2\u03b1 , UX } there corresponds the inverse mapping system TY =\n{Q\u03b1 , f \u0303\u03b2\u03b1 , UX } such that X = lim TX and Y = lim TY , where P\u03b1 and Q\u03b1\nare polyhedra over L and R respectively. The bonding mappings f\u03b2\u03b1 are\nsimplexial, but f \u0303\u03b2\u03b1 are not simplexial. Using permissible modifications (see\n\u00a72.8, Lemmas 3.2 and 3.8) we get a polyhedral expansion W = {Z\u03b1 , h\u03b1\u03b2 , F }\nof Y such that h\u03b1\u03b2 are simplexial and Z\u03b1 are polyhedra. Moreover, card(F ) =\ncard(UX )\u05d00 = card(UX ), since polyhedra Q\u03b1 are metrizable. Using sections\nof the polyhedral expansion for Y we get S with card(U) = card(V). Vice\nversa, using S we get SX , then with the help of permissible modifications we\nconstruct by SX polyhedral expansion of X and using sections of spectrum\nwe get an absolute polyhedral expansion for X.\n5.4. Note. Certainly there is not in general a mapping of T into S or\nvice versa for T and S from \u00a75.3.\nEach simplex s is clopen in its polyhedra P over L, but in general P may\nbe not open in the corresponding Banach space, because may be cases of s in\n35\n\n\fP such that dimL s < dimL P = sups\u2282P dimL s. There is the following particn\nular case of spaces X, when in their polyhedral expansions S = {Pn , fm\n, E}\npolyhedra Pn are clopen in the corresponding Banach spaces.\n5.5. Let H be a locally K-convex space, where K is a non-Archimedean\nfield. Let M be a manifold modelled on H and At(M) = {(Uj , fj ) : j \u2208 A}\nbe an atlas of M such that card(A) \u2264 w(H), where fj : Uj \u2192 Vj are\nS\nhomeomorphisms, Uj are open in M, Vj are open in H, j\u2208A Uj = M, fi \u25e6fj\u22121\nare continuous on fj (Ui \u2229 Uj ) for each Ui \u2229 Uj 6= \u2205. Let K\u0303, H\u0303 and M\u0303 denote\ncompletions of K, H and M relative to their uniformities.\nTheorem. If H is infinite-dimensional over K or K\u0303 is not locally compact, then M is homeomorphic to the clopen subset of H.\nProof. Since H\u0303 is the complete locally K\u0303-convex space, then H\u0303 =\npr \u2212 lim{H\u0303q , \u03c0vq , F } is a projective limit of Banach spaces H\u0303q over K\u0303, where\nq \u2208 F , F is an ordered set, \u03c0vq : H\u0303q \u2192 H\u0303v are linear continuous epimorphisms. Therefore, each clopen subset W in H\u0303 has a decomposition\nW = lim{Wq , \u03c0vq , F }, where Wq = \u03c0vq (W ) are clopen in H\u0303q . The base of\ntopology of M\u0303 consists of clopen subsets. If W \u2282 Vj , then fj\u22121 (W ) has an\nanalogous decomposition. From this and Proposition 2.5.6 [3] it follows, that\nM\u0303 = lim{M\u0303q , \u03c0\u0303vq , F }, where M\u0303q are manifolds on H\u0303q with continuous bonding\nmappings between charts of their atlases. If H is infinite-dimensional over\nK, then each H\u0303q is infinite-dimensional over K\u0303 [19]. From card(A) \u2264 w(H)\nit follows, that each M\u0303q has an atlas At\u2032 (M\u0303q ) = {U \u2032 j,q ; fj,q ; A\u2032 q } equivalent to\nAt(M\u0303q ) such that card(A\u2032 q ) \u2264 w(Hq ) = w(H\u0303q ), since w(H\u0303) = w(H), where\nAt(M\u0303q ) is induced by At(M\u0303 ) by the quotient mapping \u03c0\u0303q : M\u0303 \u2192 M\u0303q . In\nview of Theorem 2 [16] each M\u0303q is homeomorphic to a clopen subset S\u0303q of\nH\u0303q , where hq : M\u0303q \u2192 S\u0303q are homeomorphisms. To each clopen ball B\u0303 in\nH\u0303q there corresponds a clopen ball B = B\u0303 \u2229 Hq in Hq , hence Sq = S\u0303q \u2229 Hq\nis clopen in Hq and hq : Mq \u2192 Sq is a homeomorphism. Therefore, M is\nhomeomorphic to a closed subset V of H, where h : M \u2192 V is a homeomorphism, V \u2282 H, h = lim{id, hq , F }, id : F \u2192 F is the identity mapping.\nSince each hq is surjective, then h is surjective by Lemma 2.5.9 [3]. If x \u2208 M,\nthen \u03c0\u0303q (x) = xq \u2208 Mq , where \u03c0 : H \u2192 Hq are linear quotient mappings and\n\u03c0\u0303q : M \u2192 Mq are induced quotient mappings. Therefore, each x \u2208 M has\na neighbourhood \u03c0\u0303q\u22121 (Yq ), where Yq is an open neighbourhood of xq in Mq .\nTherefore, h(M) = V is open in H.\n5.6. Theorem. Let M be a manifold satisfying conditions of Theorem\n\n36\n\n\f5.5, where K is with non-trivial valuation, M and K are complete relative to\nn\ntheir own uniformities. Then M has a polyhedral expansion S = {Pn , fm\n, E}\nconsisting of polyhedra Pn clopen in the corresponding Banach spaces Hq over\nK.\nProof. We treat the case of non-complete K also. Let K\u0303 be a completion\nof K relative to its uniformity. If K\u0303 is not locally compact then K\u0303 contains\na proper locally compact subfield L\u0303 [22]. Since M is homeomorphic to a\nclopen subset of H, then a completion M\u0303 of M is homeomorphic to a clopen\nsubset in a completion H\u0303 of H, where H\u0303 is over K\u0303. If L\u0303 is a locally compact\nsubfield of K\u0303, then L\u0303 is spherically complete and H\u0303 can be considered as\nthe topological vector space over L\u0303 [19, 22]. By Lemmas and Theorems of\n\u00a73 we can choose Pn clopen in the corresponding Banach spaces over L\u0303. We\nalso can choose polyhedra over K\u0303, repeating proofs for M\u0303 over K\u0303. In \u00a73\npolyhedra over locally compact field were chosen that to encompass cases\nof compact spaces X, but polyhedra can be considered also over K\u0303. For\ncompact X and non locally compact K\u0303 such polyhedral expansions have\nlittle sense, since discrete Pn with singletons s as simplexes may appear\nsuch that dimK\u0303 s = 0. But for the manifold M\u0303 due to embedding into H\u0303\nas the clopen subset we get the polyhedral expansion such that Pn are nontrivial over K\u0303, moreover there exists a polyhedral expansion such that Pn are\nclopen in the corresponding Banach spaces H\u0303q for each n. Using absolute\npolyhedral expansions constructed with the help of sections of the initial\npolyhedral expansion of M\u0303 from \u00a74, we get polyhedral expansions of M over\nL\u0303 and also over K\u0303. In a particular case of complete L and K relative to their\nuniformities the manifold M is complete together with H, that is M\u0303 = M\nand H\u0303 = H, consequently, M as the topological space is homeomorphic to\nlim S.\nThe author expresses his gratefulness to Professor G.
