We give a computer-free proof of a theorem of Basak,\ndescribing the group generated by 16 complex reflections of order 3, satisfying the braid and commutation relations of the Y555\ndiagram. The group is the full isometry group of a\u221acertain lattice\nof signature (13, 1) over the Eisenstein integers Z[ 3 1]. Along the\nway we enumerate the cusps\u221aof this lattice and classify the root\nand Niemeier lattices over Z[ 3 1]\n\nThe author has conjectured [3] that the largest sporadic finite simple\ngroup, the monster, is related to complex algebraic geometry, with a\ncertain complex hyperbolic orbifold acting as a sort of intermediary. In\nparticular, the bimonster (M \u00d7 M):2 and a certain group P \u0393 acting\non complex hyperbolic\n13-space are conjecturally both quotients of\n\u0001\n13\n\u03c01 (CH \u2212 \u2206)/P \u0393 for a certain hyperplane arrangement \u2206 in CH 13 ,\ngot by adjoining very simple relations. If the conjecture is true then\nit has the consequence that P \u0393 is generated by 16 complex reflections\nof order 3, satisfying the braid and commutation relations of the Y555\ndiagram\n\nThat is, two generators braid (aba = bab) or commute (ab = ba) when\nthe corresponding nodes are joined or unjoined. Basak [4] has proven\nthis, his proof making essential use of a computer. Our purpose is to\nDate: February 6, 2008.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 22E40, 20F55.\nPartly supported by NSF grant DMS-0600112.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDANIEL ALLCOCK\n\ngive a conceptual, computer-free proof. We hope that it will clarify\nwhich structures will be important for further work on the conjecture\nof [3].\nWe will describe the players in the main theorem, state the theorem,\nand then summarize the sections. \u0393 is the group of all isometries\nof a\n\u221a\nThis\ncertain lattice L13,1 over the Eisenstein integers E = Z[\u03c9= 3 1]. \u221a\nlattice has the property that L13,1 = \u03b8L\u203213,1 , where \u03b8 = \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9\u0304 = \u22123\nand the prime indicates the dual lattice. Also, L13,1 is the unique Elattice of signature (13, 1) with this property. An explicit model for it\nappears in section 3. The Artin group of the Y555 diagram means the\nabstract group with one generator for each node of the diagram, with\nthe braid and commutation relations described above. Such groups\narise naturally in the fundamental groups of hyperplane complements.\nA triflection means a complex reflection of order 3, where a complex\nreflection means a nontrivial isometry of a Hermitian vector space that\nfixes a hyperplane pointwise. Complex reflections arise naturally when\nstudying branched covers, in a manner explained in [3].\nTheorem 1 ([4]). Up to complex conjugation, there is a unique irreducible action of the Y555 Artin group on a Hermitian vector space of\ndimension > 1 in which the generators act by triflections. The image\nof this representation is Aut L13,1 .\nIn section 1 we give background on Eisenstein lattices, and in section 2 we classify two types of such lattices, the root lattices (analogous\nto the ADE lattices over Z) and the Eisenstein Niemeier lattices (equivalently, E-lattice structures on the Niemeier lattices). The point of this\nis to enumerate the 5 cusps of CH 13 /P \u0393 and be able to recognize one as\nhaving \"Leech type\". Section 3 describes L13,1 in a manner convenient\nfor the proof of the theorem, which appears in section 4. Throughout,\nwe use ATLAS notation [6] for group extensions: A.B, A:B and A*B.\n1. Eisenstein lattices\nWe have already introduced\nthe Eisenstein integers E = Z[\u03c9] and\n\u221a\ndefined \u03b8 = \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9\u0304 = \u22123. An E-lattice L means a free E-module\nequipped with an E-valued Hermitian form h|i, linear in its first argument and antilinear in its second. The norm |x|2 of a vector means\nhx|xi. We call L nondegenerate if L\u22a5 = 0; in this case the dual lattice\nL\u2032 means the set of all v \u2208 L \u2297 C with hL|vi \u2286 E. All the lattices\nwe will meet satisfy L \u2286 \u03b8L\u2032 := \u03b8 * (L\u2032 ), which is to say that all inner\nproducts are divisible by \u03b8. This should be thought of as an ordinary\nintegrality condition, because it means that the underlying Z-lattice\n\n\fON THE Y555 COMPLEX REFLECTION GROUP\n\n3\n\nLZ , with x * y = 32 Rehx|yi, is integral and even. The rescaling by 23 is\nnot important; it is a nuisance arising from the fact that the smallest\nscale at which L is integral as an E-lattice is different from the smallest scale at which it is an integral Z-lattice. Most of our lattices will\nalso satisfy L = \u03b8L\u2032 , which is the same as the unimodularity of LZ . If\nL = \u03b8L\u2032 then det L = \u00b1\u03b8dim L (which makes sense since dim L turns\nout to be even).\nExamples of L with L = \u03b8L\u2032 are the Eisenstein versions of the E8\nlattice ([7, ch. 7, example 11b] or theorem 3 below) and the Leech lattice\n([9], scaled to have minimal norm 6). It is well-known that an indefinite\neven unimodular Z-lattice is determined by its signature, and there is a\ncorresponding result for E-lattices. Namely, an E-lattice L of signature\n(p, n) satisfying L = \u03b8L\u2032 exists if and only if p \u2212 n \u2261 0 modulo 4, and\nL is unique when this signature is indefinite. A proof appears in [4].\nThe main player in this paper is this lattice of signature (13, 1), for\nwhich we will write L13,1 . We studied it in [2], using slightly different\nconventions (signature (1, 13) and h|i linear in its second argument\nrather than its first) and a particular explicit model. In section 3 we\nwill give a different explicit model.\nIf L is an E-lattice satisfying L \u2286 \u03b8L\u2032 , then r \u2208 L is called a root of\nL if |r|2 = 3. The language reflects two things. First, r becomes a root\nin the usual sense (a vector of norm 2) when we pass to LZ . Second,\nthe complex reflection\nhx|ri\n(1)\nx 7\u2192 x + (\u03c9 \u2212 1) 2 r\n|r|\nis an isometry of L, so that roots give reflections, analogously to roots\nin Z-lattices. But this is a triflection; we call it the \u03c9-reflection in r,\nsince it multiplies r by \u03c9 and fixes r \u22a5 pointwise. If r and r \u2032 are nonproportional roots, then their \u03c9-reflections braid if and only if |hr|r \u2032i|2 = 3.\nOne can check this by multiplying out 2 \u00d7 2 matrices.\n2. Root lattices; Niemeier lattices; Null vectors of L13,1\nAt a key point in section 4 we will need to recognize a particular\nnull vector \u03c1 of L13,1 as having \"Leech type\", which is to say that\n\u03c1\u22a5 /h\u03c1i is a copy of the complex Leech lattice. The reader may skip\nthis section if he is prepared to accept one consequence of theorem 4\nbelow: a primitive null vector of L13,1 whose stabilizer contains a copy\nof L3 (3) has Leech type. There is a quicker-and-dirtier proof than the\none we give, but we think the E-lattice classifications are interesting in\nthemselves.\n\n\f4\n\nDANIEL ALLCOCK\n\nWe will need to understand the orbits of primitive null vectors in\nL13,1 . These turn out to be in bijection with the positive-definite 12dimensional lattices L satisfying L = \u03b8L\u2032 ; we will call such lattices\nEisenstein Niemeier lattices, since their real forms are positive-definite\n24-dimensional even unimodular lattices, classified by Niemeier. Since\nroot lattices play a major role in Niemeier's classification, they do in\nours too, so we define an Eisenstein root lattice to be a positive-definite\nE-lattice L satisfying L \u2286 \u03b8L\u2032 and spanned by its roots.\nWe will establish the bijection between Eisenstein Niemeier lattices\nand orbits of primitive null vectors in L13,1 , then classify the Eisenstein\nroot lattices, and then use this to classify the Eisenstein Niemeier lattices. The root lattice classification is similar to and simpler then the\nwell-known ADE classification of root lattices over Z. The Eisenstein\nNiemeier lattices turn out to correspond to five of the classical Niemeier\nlattices.\nLemma 2. Suppose p, n > 0, p \u2212 n \u2261 0 (4), and Lp,n is the unique\nE-lattice of signature (p, n) satisfying Lp,n = \u03b8L\u2032p,n . If \u03c1 is a primitive\nnull vector then L := \u03c1\u22a5 /h\u03c1i is a lattice of signature (p \u2212 1, n \u2212 1)\nthat satisfies L = \u03b8L\u2032 . Every such L arises this way. Two primitive\nnull vectors \u03c11 , \u03c12 of Lp,n are equivalent under Aut Lp,n if and only if\n\u223c \u22a5\n\u03c1\u22a5\n1 /h\u03c11 i = \u03c12 /h\u03c12 i.\nProof. (This is essentially the same as for even unimodular Z-lattices.)\nBy Lp,n = \u03b8L\u2032p,n , there exists w \u2208 L with h\u03c1|wi = \u03b8. Adding a\u0001 multiple\nof \u03c1 to w allows us to also assume |w|2 = 0, so h\u03c1, wi \u223c\n= 0\u03b8\u0304 \u03b80 . Therefore h\u03c1, wi = \u03b8h\u03c1, wi\u2032, so h\u03c1, wi is a summand of Lp,n . The other sum\u0001\u2032\nmand h\u03c1, wi\u22a5 must also satisfy h\u03c1, wi\u22a5 = \u03b8 h\u03c1, wi\u22a5 , and it projects\nisometrically to \u03c1\u22a5 /h\u03c1i. This establishes the first claim. For the second, given\nL of signature (p \u2212 1, n \u2212 1) satisfying L = \u03b8L\u2032 , we have\n\u0001\nL \u2295 0\u03b8\u0304 0\u03b8 \u223c\n= Lp,n , and it is now obvious that L is \u03c1\u22a5 /h\u03c1i for a suitable null vector \u03c1. In the last claim, if \u03c11 and \u03c12 are equivalent, then\n\u223c \u22a5\nobviously \u03c1\u22a5\n1 /h\u03c11 i = \u03c12 /h\u03c12 i, so it suffices to show the converse. The\nargument for the first claim\nthere is a direct sum decom\u0001 implies that \u22a5\n0 \u03b8\n\u223c\n\u223c\nposition Lp,n = M1 \u2295 \u03b8\u0304 0 with M1 = \u03c11 /h\u03c11 i and \u03c11 corresponding\nto one of the coordinate vectors of the 2 \u00d7 2 block. And there is a similar decomposition with \u03c12 in place of \u03c11 . Then, given an isomorphism\nM1 \u223c\n= M2 , it is easy to write down an automorphism of Lp,n sending \u03c11\nto \u03c12 .\n\u0003\n\n\fON THE Y555 COMPLEX REFLECTION GROUP\n\nL\n\nR\n\nAE2\nZ/3\nE\nD4\nSL2 (3)\nE6E 31+2 :SL2 (3)\nE8E 3 \u00d7 Sp4 (3)\n\nAut L\n\n5\n\n\u03b8L\u2032 \u2212 L\n| Aut L| \u03b8L /L min. norm\n\n\u00d7 Z/2\n6\n\u00d7 Z/3\n72\n\u00d7 Z/2\n1,296\n\u00d7 1 155,520\n\n\u2032\n\nF13\nF14\nF13\n0\n\n1\n3/2\n2\n\nTable 1.

Every nonzero element of\n\u03b8L\u2032 /L has minimal representatives of norm given in the\nlast column.\nTheorem 3. Any Eisenstein root lattice is a direct sum of copies of\nthe following 4 lattices:\nAE2 = \u03b8E\n\b\nD4E = (x, x, y) \u2208 E 3 : x \u2261 y (\u03b8)\n\b\nE6E = (x, y, z) \u2208 E 3 : x \u2261 y \u2261 z (\u03b8)\n\b\nE8E = (x1 , . . . , x4 ) \u2208 E 4 : \u03c0(x1 , . . . , x4 ) \u2208 C4 \u2286 F43 ,\n\nwhich have the properties listed in table 2. (We use the standard inner\nproduct on Cn . Also, the description of E8E refers to the map \u03c0 : E 4 \u2192\nE 4 /\u03b8E 4 = F43 and the tetracode C4 , i.e., the subspace of F43 spanned by\n(0, 1, 1, 1) and (1, 0, 1, \u22121).)\nProof. The data in the table will be helpful in the classification, so we\nbegin there. The claims for L = AE2 are obvious; we remark that the\nsmallest elements of \u03b8L\u2032 \u2212 L are the units of E, and all others have\nnorm > 3.\nNow let L = D4E . Its 24 roots are the scalar multiples of (\u03c9 i , \u03c9 i , 1)\nand (0, 0, \u03b8). It is easy to see that conjugation by each of the 24/6 = 4\ncyclic groups generated by triflections permutes the other 3 cyclically.\nTherefore R is generated by two triflections that braid, so it is an image\nof ha, b | aba = bab, a3 = b3 = 1i, which is a presentation for SL2 (3). To\nsee that R is SL2 (3) rather than a proper quotient, consider its action\non L/\u03b8L \u223c\n= F23 . Now, R permutes the scalar classes of roots as the\n\n\f6\n\nDANIEL ALLCOCK\n\nalternating group A4 , so if we choose any 2 non-proportional roots r\nand s, then Aut L is generated by R together with the transformations\nsending r to a multiple of itself and s to a multiple of itself. Since\nhr|si =\n6 0, such a transformation must be a scalar. So Aut L = R \u00d7 h\u03c9i.\nFinally, it is easy to see that the norm 6 vectors of L are the scalar\nmultiples of (\u03c9 i , \u03c9 i , 1 + \u03b8) and (\u03b8, \u03b8, 0), and that the halves of these\nvectors span \u03b8L\u2032 . In fact, the halves of these vectors account for all the\nelements of \u03b8L\u2032 \u2212 L of norm \u2264 3, and are all equivalent under Aut L.\ni\nRepresentatives for \u03b8L\u2032 /L are 0 and \u03c92 (\u03b8, \u03b8, 0), so \u03b8L\u2032 /L \u223c\n= F14 .\nNow let L = E8E . Because it is got from (AE2 )4 by gluing along\n\u00014\nthe 2-dimensional code C4 \u2286 \u03b8(AE2 )\u2032 /AE2 \u223c\n= F43 , it satisfies L = \u03b8L\u2032 ,\njustifying the last two entries in the table. The descriptions of R and\nAut L are justified by theorem 5.2 of [2]. (The proof in [2] appeals to\na coset enumeration to establish that L contains the scalars of order 3;\nthis may be avoided by observing that L contains 4 mutually orthogonal\nroots.)\nNow let L = E6E and note that the following symmetries are visible:\npermutation of coordinates, multiplication of coordinates by cube roots\nof unity, and the scalar \u22121. It is easy to see that \u03b8L\u2032 = {(x, y, z) \u2208 E 3 :\nx + y + z \u2261 0 (\u03b8)}, whose 54 minimal vectors are got from (1, \u22121, 0) by\napplying these symmetries. Note also that these are the only elements\nof \u03b8L\u2032 \u2212 L of norm \u2264 3. It is easy to see that \u03b8L\u2032 /L \u223c\n= F13 . Also,\nL is the orthogonal complement of r = (0, 0, 0, \u03b8) \u2208 E8E , and every\nautomorphism \u03c6 of E6E extends uniquely to an automorphism of E8E that\neither fixes or negates r. (The extension fixes or negates r according\nto whether \u03c6 fixes or negates \u03b8L\u2032 /L \u223c\n= F13 .) It follows\n= \u03b8hri\u2032/hri \u223c\n1\nthat | Aut L| \u2264 2 \u00d7 240 \u00d7 155, 520 = 1296. Since triflections must act\ntrivially on F13 , we also have |R| \u2264 648. We will show that R has\nstructure 31+2 :SL2 (3); this will justify the first column of the table,\nand (since \u22121 \u2208\n/ R) also the second.\nTo see the map R \u2192 SL2 (3), consider the action on L/3L\u2032 \u223c\n= F23 . All\nroots are equivalent under Aut L (since any two root in a D4E are Requivalent), and the 72 roots fall into 8 classes of size 9, accounting for\nall 8 nonzero elements of L/3L\u2032 . This space supports a symplectic form,\ngiven by dividing inner products by \u03b8 and then reducing mod \u03b8. The \u03c9reflection in a root projects to the symplectic transvection in the image\nof the root. Now we study the kernel K of R \u2192 SL2 (3). If r and s are\northogonal roots then their \u03c9-reflections map to the same transvection\nL/3L\u2032 (since they map to commuting transvections), so the quotient\nof the reflections lies in K. This shows: if an automorphism of L\nhas 3 roots as eigenvectors, with eigenvalues 1, \u03c9 and \u03c9\u0304, then it lies\n\n\fON THE Y555 COMPLEX REFLECTION GROUP\n\n7\n\nin K. For example, diag[1, w, \u03c9\u0304] \u2208 K. Also, the cyclic permutation of\ncoordinates lies in K. These two elements of K generate an extraspecial\ngroup 31+2 . Since 27 * |SL2 (3)| = 648, we have shown R = 31+2 .SL2 (3).\nThe extension splits because the reflection group of a D4E sublattice\nprovides a complement.\nHaving established the table, we will now classify the Eisenstein\nroot lattices. Call such a lattice decomposable if its roots fall into\ntwo or more nonempty classes, with members of distinct classes being\northogonal. In this case it is a direct sum of lower-dimensional root\nlattices, so it suffices to show that AE2 , D4E , E6E and E8E are the only\nindecomposable Eisenstein root lattices. We will use the following facts,\nestablished above. (i) If L = AE2 , D4E or E6E , then Aut L acts transitively\non the vectors of \u03b8L\u2032 \u2212 L of norm \u2264 3. (ii) E8E = \u03b8(E8E )\u2032 .\nSuppose M is an indecomposable Eisenstein root lattice. If dim M =\n1 then obviously M \u223c\n= AE2 . If dim M = 2 then it contains a 1dimensional indecomposable root lattice L, and we know L \u223c\n= AE2 . Also,\nM contains a root r not in L\u2297C, whose projection to L\u2297C is nonzero.\nSince this projection is an element r of \u03b8L\u2032 \u2212 {0} of norm < 3, and\nAut L acts transitively on such vectors, there is an essentially unique\npossibility for hL, ri. Since D4E arises by this construction, hL, ri \u223c\n= D4E .\nTherefore M lies between \u03b8(D4E )\u2032 and D4E . Since every norm 3 vector\nof \u03b8(D4E )\u2032 lies in D4E , we have M \u223c\n= D4E . If dim M = 3 then the same\nargument, with L = D4E , shows that M \u223c\n= E6E . If dim M > 3, then\nE\nthe same argument, with L = E6 , shows that M contains E8E . Then\nE8 = \u03b8(E8E )\u2032 implies that E8E is a summand of M, and indecomposabil\u0003\nity implies M \u223c\n= E8E .\nTheorem\n4. There are exactly 5 Eisenstein Niemeier lattices:\n\u0001\nE 12\nA2\nglued along the ternary Golay code, with group 312 :2M12 ;\n\u0001\n6\nD4E glued along the hexacode, with group SL2 (3)6 :3A6 ;\n\u00014\n\u00014\nE6E glued along the tetracode, with group 31+2 :SL2 (3) :SL2 (3);\n\u00013\n\u00013\nE8E , with group 3 \u00d7 Sp4 (3) :S3 ; and\nthe complex Leech lattice \u039bE24 , with group 6Suz .\nHere, M12 and Suz are the sporadic finite simple groups of Mathieu\nand Suzuki.\nProof. Our argument is similar in spirit to Venkov's treatment [8] of\nNiemeier's classification. Suppose L is an Eisenstein Niemeier lattice\nand LZ its underlying real lattice. By Niemeier's classification, there\nare 24 possibilities for LZ ; in 23 cases the roots span LZ up to finite\nindex, and in the last case LZ has no roots and is the Leech lattice.\n\n\f8\n\nDANIEL ALLCOCK\n\nBy theorem 3, the root system of LZ must be a sum of A2 , D4 , E6\nand E8 root systems. Considering Niemeier's list shows that LZ 's root\n6\n4\n3\nsystem is A12\n2 , D4 , E6 , E8 or empty. We treat the first four cases first.\nTheorem 3 shows that there is a unique Eisenstein structure on the\nroot sublattice of LZ , so the sublattice L0 of L spanned by its roots\nis (AE2 )12 , (D4E )6 , (E6E )4 or (E8E )3 . In the last case we have L = L0\nand are done. In the other cases, L lies between \u03b8L\u20320 and L0 , so it is\n6\n4\ndetermined by its image C in \u03b8L\u20320 /L0 \u223c\n= F12\n3 , F4 or F3 in the three cases.\nWe must have C \u2286 C \u22a5 (with respect to the usual quadratic form on Fn3\nor Hermitian form on F64 ), in order to have L \u2286 \u03b8L\u2032 . Also, C must be\nhalf-dimensional in \u03b8L\u20320 /L0 , in order to have L = \u03b8L\u2032 . Finally, all roots\nof L already lie in L0 , by definition.\nIn the A2 case, these conditions imply that C is a selfdual code of\nlength 12 with no codewords of weight 3. The ternary Golay code is\nthe unique such code, up to monomial transformations of F12\n3 , so C is\nit and L is as described. In the D4 case, C is a selfdual subspace of F64\nwith no codewords of weight 2. The hexacode is the unique such code,\nup to monomial transformations, so C is it and L is as described. In\nthe E6 case, C is a 2-dimensional subspace of F43 having no codewords\nof weight < 3. Again there is a unique candidate, the tetracode, and\nL is as described.\nNext we treat the case that LZ is the Leech lattice; we must show\nthat L is the complex Leech lattice. I know of 3 completely independent\napproaches. (1) The uniqueness of the E-module structure on the Leech\nlattice is the same as the uniqueness of the conjugacy class in Co 0 =\nAut(LZ ) of elements of order 3 with no fixed vectors. This can be\nchecked by consulting the character table [6] for Co 0 . (2) Use lemma 2,\ntogether with theorem 4.1 of [2], which contains the statement that\nL13,1 has a unique orbit of primitive null vectors orthogonal to no roots.\n(3) Presumably one can mimic Conway's characterization of the Leech\nlattice [5], applying analogues of his counting argument to L/\u03b8L.\nThe automorphism group of \u039bE24 is treated in detail in [9]. The other\nautomorphism groups are easy to work out. Let L0 = M n be the\ndecomposition of L0 into its indecomposable summands and let R be\nthe group generated by triflections in the roots of M. Recall from\ntheorem 3 that Aut M splits as R \u00d7 C, where C denotes the group of\nscalars from column 3 of table 2. Obviously Aut L \u2286 Aut L0 = (Rn \u00d7\nC n ):Sn ; indeed it is the subgroup of this that preserves C \u2286 (\u03b8M \u2032 /M)n .\nNow, R acts trivially and C n :Sn acts by monomial transformations.\nTherefore Aut L is the semidirect product of Rn by the subgroup of\nC n :Sn whose action preserves C. This latter group is 2M12 , 3A6 , SL2 (3)\nor S3 in the four cases. (The automorphism group of the hexacode is\n\n\fON THE Y555 COMPLEX REFLECTION GROUP\n\nsupport\n0\n6\n9\n9\n12\n\ncoordinates description\n013\n+ \u2212 3 07\n\u00b1(+9 04 )\n\u00b1(+6 \u22123 04 )\n+6 \u22126 0\n3\n\n9\n\nnumber\n\n1\ndifference of lines\n156\naffine plane\n26\nsum of 3 general lines\n468\nl1 + l2 \u2212 l3 \u2212 l3 for 4 concurrent lines 78\n\nTable 2. The elements of C.\nsometimes given as 3*S6 , but the elements not in 3A6 are F4 -antilinear,\nso they arise from antilinear maps L \u2192 L.)\n\u0003\n3. A model of L13,1\nIn this section we describe L13,1 with 313 :L3 (3) among its visible symmetries. We begin with the vector space F13\n3 , with coordinates indexed\nby the points of P 2 F3 , and proceed to define two codes. The first is the\n\"line difference code\" C, spanned by the differences of (characteristic\nfunctions of) lines of P 2 F3 , and the second is the \"line code\", which derives its name from the fact that it is spanned by lines, but is formally\ndefined (and written) as C \u22a5 (with respect to the usual inner product).\nTwo lines of P 2 F3 meet in 1 point (or 4), and it follows that C is\northogonal to every line, hence orthogonal to itself. Therefore dim C \u2264\n6. On the other hand, it is easy to enumerate some elements of C\n(table 2). This shows that dim C = 6 and also that the enumeration\nis complete. Therefore dim C \u22a5 = 7, and since a line lies in C \u22a5 but not\nC, we see that C \u22a5 is indeed spanned by lines. It will be useful to have\na list of the elements of C \u22a5 : these are the codewords in table 3, their\nnegatives, and the elements of C. We compiled table 3 by adding the\nall 1's vector (the sum of all 13 lines) to the elements of C.\nWe work with the usual inner product of signature (13, 1) on C14 ,\nhx|yi = \u2212x0 \u02330 + x1 \u02331 + * * * + x13 \u023313 ,\n\nindex the last 13 coordinates by the points of P 2 F3 , and define L as\nthe set of vectors (x0 ; x1 , . . . , x13 ) such that x0 \u2261 x1 + * * * + x13 mod \u03b8\nand that (x1 , . . . , x13 ), modulo \u03b8, is an element of C \u22a5 .\nTheorem 5. L is isomorphic to L13,1 and is spanned by the 13 \"point\nroots\" (0; \u03b8, 012 ), with the \u03b8 in any of the last 13 spots, and the 13 \"line\nroots\" (1; 14 , 09 ), with the 1's along a line of P 2 F3 .\nProof. It is easy to see that the point and line roots span L. If p is a\npoint root and l a line root, then hp|li = \u03b8 or 0 according to whether\n\n\f10\n\nDANIEL ALLCOCK\n\nsupport coordinates description\n4\n7\n7\n10\n10\n13\n13\n\n+4 0 9\n+ \u22126 06\n+4 \u22123 06\n+4 \u22126 03\n+7 \u22123 03\n+4 \u22129\n+13\n1\n\nnumber\n\nline\n13\nsum of two lines (negated)\n78\n\u22121 on vertices, 0 on edges, 1 elsewhere 234\n0 on vertices, \u22121 on edges, 1 elsewhere 234\n\u22121 on l1 \u2212 l2 , 0 on l2 \u2212 l1 , 1 elsewhere 156\n1 on a line, \u22121 elsewhere\n13\n1\n\nTable 3.

Also, any two point roots are orthogonal,\nas are any two line roots. Therefore L \u2286 \u03b8L\u2032 . To see L = \u03b8L\u2032 , check\nthat L contains (\u03b8; 013 ) and consider the span M of it and the point\nroots. Then \u03b8M \u2032 /M \u223c\n= F14\n3 , and we need to check that the image of\nL therein is 7-dimensional. This is easy because we know dim C \u22a5 = 7\nand the 0th coordinate of an element of L is determined modulo \u03b8 by\nthe others.\n\u0003\nThe promised group 313 :L3 (3) is generated by the triflections in the\npoint roots and the permutations of the last 13 coordinates by L3 (3).\nThe following lemma is not central; it is used only to establish the\nequality of two lattices in the proof of lemma 9.\nLemma 6. Let M be the 12-dimensional lattice consisting of all vectors\nin (\u03b8E)13 with coordinate sum zero. Then there is a unique lattice N\npreserved by L3 (3), strictly containing M, and satisfying N \u2286 \u03b8N \u2032 .\nProof sketch: Any lattice N containing M and satisfying N \u2286 \u03b8N \u2032 lies\nin \u03b8M \u2032 , so that it corresponds to a subspace of Z := \u03b8M \u2032 /M. And Z is\nthe coordinate-sum-zero subspace of F13\n3 . The lemma follows from the\nfact that C is the unique nontrivial L3 (3)-invariant subspace. To see\nthis, one checks that C is irreducible under L3 (3), so that Z/C is also\nirreducible (being the dual), and that C has no invariant complement.\n\u0003\n4. Generation of Aut(L13,1 ) by the Y555 triflections\nIn this section we prove the main theorem, theorem 1. First we prove\nuniqueness. Label the generators by g1 , . . . , g16 . The argument of [2,\n\n\fON THE Y555 COMPLEX REFLECTION GROUP\n\n11\n\nsec. 5] shows that without loss we may take the gi to be the \u03c9-reflections\nin pairwise linearly independent vectors r1 , . . . , r16 of norm 3, satisfying\n|hri |rj i|2 = 3 or 0 according to whether gi and gj braid or commute.\nIt is convenient to 2-color Y555 and suppose hri |rj i = \u03b8 (resp. \u2212\u03b8)\nwhen gi and gj braid and gi is black (resp. white). The inner product\nmatrix of the ri turns out to have rank 14 (by direct computation or the\nrealization below), so V must have dimension 14 (by irreducibility of\nV and connectedness of Y555 ). The ri are determined up to isometries\nof V by their inner products, so their configuration is unique.\nHaving proven uniqueness of the representation, we can define R as\nits image. To identify R with Aut L13,1 , we will use the model for L13,1\nfrom the previous section, and write L for it. Let \u2206 be the incidence\ngraph of the points and lines of P 2F3 , and color the nodes corresponding\nto points black and lines white. Then the point and line roots from\ntheorem 5 satisfy the same inner product conditions as the ri chosen\nabove. It is possible (uniquely up to L3 (3)) to embed the Y555 diagram\ninto \u2206, preserving node colors. So the 16 roots for Y555 may be taken\nto be 16 of the point and line roots. It would be annoying to make a\nchoice of which 16, and we are saved from this by the following lemma.\nLemma 7. The 16 roots for Y555 span L, and R contains L3 (3) and\nthe triflections in all the point and line roots.\nProof. First observe that Y555 contains an 11-chain E and a 4-chain F\nnot joined to it. By [2, fig. 5.1], the roots of E span a copy of L9,1 and\nthose of F a copy of E8E , so together they span L. This proves our first\nassertion.\nOne can check that for any 11-chain E in \u2206, E has a unique extension\nto a 12-cycle C, and that the nodes of \u2206 not joined to C form a 4chain F . (E is unique up to L3 (3):2, so checking a single example\nsuffices.) We claim that if R contains the triflections in the roots of E,\nthen it also contains the triflections in the root extending E to C. We\nuse a computation-free variation of the proof of [4, lemma 3.2]. First\nuse the fact that the roots of F span a copy of E8E , whose orthogonal\ncomplement in L must be a copy of L9,1 . By [2, thm. 5.2], Aut L9,1 is\ngenerated by the triflections of E and hence lies in R. And since the\nextending root is orthogonal to E8E , it also lies in L9,1 , so its triflections\nalso lie in R. This proves the claim. Now, starting with the three 11chains in Y555 and repeatedly applying the claim shows that R contains\nthe triflections in all 26 roots.\nWe use a similar trick to show L3 (3) \u2286 R. Consider any Y555 \u2286 \u2206,\nand let E be one of its 11-chains and F the 4-chain in Y555 not joined\nto it. Let \u03c6 be the diagram automorphism of Y555 that fixes each node\n\n\f12\n\nDANIEL ALLCOCK\n\nof F and exchanges the ends of E. One can check that \u03c6 extends to an\nautomorphism of \u2206, preserving node colors since it has a fixed point.\nTherefore \u03c6 defines an automorphism of L, permuting the point and\nline roots as it permutes the points and lines of P 2F3 . Since \u03c6 fixes\nF pointwise, it is an automorphism of the L9,1 spanned by the roots\nof E. We already know that R contains Aut L9,1 , so it contains \u03c6. So\neach Y555 \u2286 \u2206 gives rise to an S3 \u2286 R \u2229 L3 (3). The set of elements of\nR \u2229 L3 (3) so obtained, from all Y555 subdiagrams, is clearly normal in\nL3 (3). Since L3 (3) is simple, R \u2229 L3 (3) is all of L3 (3). (This diagramautomorphism trick was also used in [2, thm. 5.1] and [4, thm. 5.8].) \u0003\nThe next lemma shows that if R contains certain triflections, then\nit contains a well-understood group, of finite index in the stabilizer of\na null vector. The lemma after that shows that R does indeed contain\nthese triflections, and then we can complete the proof of theorem 1 by\nshowing R = Aut L.\nLemma 8. Suppose L is an E-lattice of dimension > 2 satisfying L =\n\u03b8L\u2032 . Suppose \u03c1 is a primitive null vector and ri are roots satisfying\nhri |\u03c1i = \u03b8, such that the span of their differences projects onto \u03c1\u22a5 /h\u03c1i.\nLet G be the group generated by the triflections in the ri and \u03c1 + ri .\nThen G contains every element of Aut L that acts by a scalar on h\u03c1i\nand trivially on \u03c1\u22a5 /h\u03c1i\nRemark. The hypothesis dim L > 2 is necessary and should also have\nbeen imposed in theorem 3.2 of [2].\nProof. This is implicit in the proofs of theorem 3.1 and 3.2 of [2]; since\nthe argument is slightly different and our conventions there were different, we phrase the argument in coordinate-free language and refer\nto [2] for the supporting calculations. By the unipotent radical U of\nthe stabilizer of \u03c1 we mean the automorphisms of L that fix \u03c1 and act\ntrivially on M := \u03c1\u22a5 /h\u03c1i. It is a Heisenberg group, with center Z equal\nto its commutator subgroup and isomorphic to Z, with U/Z a copy of\nthe additive group of M. The set X of scalar classes of roots r with\nhr|\u03c1i = |\u03b8| is a principal homogeneous space for U, and the set X/Z\nof its Z-orbits is a principal homogeneous space for U/Z \u223c\n= M. If r\nis a root with hr|\u03c1i = \u03b8, then the triflections in r and \u03c1 + r can be\ncomposed to yield a transformation multiplying \u03c1 by a primitive 6th\nroot of unity and acting on X/Z by scalar multiplication by a primitive\n6th root of unity, where X/Z is identified with M by taking rZ as the\norigin. Write \u03c6r for this transformation (which depends only on rZ,\nthough we don't need this).\n\n\fON THE Y555 COMPLEX REFLECTION GROUP\n\n13\n\nSuppose r \u2032 is another root with hr \u2032 |\u03c1i = \u03b8. Since X/Z is a principal\nhomogeneous space modeled on M, there exists m \u2208 M with m * rZ =\nr \u2032 Z. Then \u03c6r \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121\nr \u2032 turns out to be an element of U, acting on X/Z\nby translation by a unit times m. Under the hypothesis of the lemma,\nG contains elements of U for sufficiently many m to span M as an\nE-lattice. Taking conjugates by (any) \u03c6r gives the unit scalar multiples\nof these m, so G contains enough elements of U to generate M as a\ngroup. Taking commutators shows that G contains Z, so it contains\nall of U. And hU, \u03c6r i consists of all the elements of Aut L that we are\nasserting to lie in G.\n\u0003\nLemma 9. Let \u03c1 be the primitive null vector (\u22124 \u2212 \u03c9; 113 ) \u2208 L. If\nr is one of the 156 roots (2 + \u03b8; 03 , \u03c9\u0304 3, \u221217 ) or one of the 234 roots\n(\u22122\u03c9\u0304; \u03c9\u0304 4 , \u221213 , 06 ), then hr|\u03c1i = \u03b8 and R contains the triflections in r\nand \u03c1 + r. The differences of these 390 roots span \u03c1\u22a5 .\nRemarks. The exact placement of the coordinates can be determined up\nto L3 (3) by reducing the last 13 coordinates modulo \u03b8 and comparing\nwith the list of elements of C \u22a5 . For example, for one of the 156 roots,\nthe 0's lie on one line of P 2 F3 , the \u03c9\u0304's lie on another, and the \u22121's are\neverywhere else, including the point where the lines intersect. (There\nare 13 * 12 = 156 ways to choose the two lines.) The same method\napplies to all vectors referred to in the proof. Also, R contains the\ntriflections in some less-complicated roots r satisfying hr|\u03c1i = \u03b8, for\nexample the point roots. But for these, showing that R contains the\ntriflections in \u03c1 + r is harder. We chose these roots because both r and\n\u03c1 + r have small 0th coordinate.\nProof. Checking hr|\u03c1i = \u03b8 is just a computation. Now we show that R\nhas various roots r (meaning that it contains the triflections in them).\nWe will use the following fact repeatedly: if R has roots a and b, and\nha|bi = \u03c9 \u2212 1 or \u03c9\u0304 \u2212 1, then a + b is a root and R has it too. (This is\nbecause ha, bi \u223c\n= D4E , and the reflections in any two independent roots\nof D4E generate the whole reflection group of D4E .) We know already\nthat R has the line roots and their images under scalars and 313 :L3 (3).\nStep 1: R has the roots (\u03b8; 13 , \u221213 , 07 ) with the 1's collinear and the\n\u22121's collinear. Take b to be the line root (1; 14 , 09 ), and try a having\nthe form (\u2212\u03c9; ?, 03 , ?3 , 06 ), where the ?'s are negated cube roots of 1,\nlying along a different line. We try this a because a + b = (1 \u2212 \u03c9; . . . ),\nso if we can choose the ?'s with ha|bi = \u03c9 \u00b11 \u2212 1, then we can conclude\nthat R has a root a + b = (1 \u2212 \u03c9; . . . ), which we didn't know before.\nWe may in fact achieve ha|bi = \u03c9 \u2212 1, by taking (say) all the ?'s to be\n\u22121. Then R has the root (1 \u2212 \u03c9; 0, 13, \u221213 , 06). Applying a scalar and\n\n\f14\n\nDANIEL ALLCOCK\n\nan element of 313 :L3 (3) finishes step 1 (this part of the argument will\nbe left implicit in steps 2\u20135).\nStep 2: R has the roots (2; \u221214 , 13, 06 ) with the 1's at three noncollinear points, the 0's on the lines joining them, and the \u22121's everywhere else. Take b = (\u03b8; 13 , \u221213 , 07 ) from step 1, and try a =\n(1; ?, 02, ?, 02 , ?2 , 05 ), with the ?'s lying on a line that meets a 1 and a \u22121\nof b. Solving for the ?'s as before reveals that a = (1; \u03c9\u0304, 02 , 1, 02, ?2 , 05)\nsatisfies ha|bi = \u03c9 \u2212 1. So R has the root (\u03b8 + 1; \u2212\u03c9, 12, 0, \u221212 , ?2 , 05)\nwhere the ?'s are cube roots of 1-exactly which ones is unimportant.\nStep 3: R has the roots (2; 16, \u22121, 06 ), where the 1's all lie on two\nlines through the \u22121. Take b = (1; 14, 09 ) and try a = (1; ?, 03, ?3 , 06 ).\nSolving for the ?'s reveals that a = (1; \u03c9, 03, ?3 , 06 ) satisfies ha|bi =\n\u03c9 \u2212 1. So R has the root a + b = (2; \u2212\u03c9\u0304, 13 , ?3 , 06 ) with the ?'s being\ncube roots of 1.\nStep 4: R has the roots (2 \u2212 \u03c9\u0304; \u221213 , 03 , 17 ), with the \u22121's collinear\nand the 0's collinear. Take b = (2; 16, \u22121, 06 ) from step 3, and try\na = (\u2212\u03c9\u0304; 06 , ?, ?3 , 03 ) where the ?'s all lie on a line through the \u22121\nof b. Solving for the ?'s reveals that a = (\u2212\u03c9\u0304; 06 , \u2212\u03c9, ?3 , 03 ) satisfies\nha|bi = \u03c9\u0304 \u2212 1. So R has the root a + b = (2 \u2212 \u03c9\u0304; 16, \u03c9\u0304, ?3 , 03 ), where\nthe ?'s are negated cube roots of 1.\nStep 5: R has the roots (2 + \u03b8; \u221214 , 16 , 03 ) with the 0's at noncollinear points, the 1's on the lines joining them and the \u22121's everywhere else. Take b = (2 \u2212 \u03c9\u0304; \u221213 , 03 , 17 ) from step 4, and try a =\n(\u03c9; ?, 02, ?, 02, ?2 , 05 ). Solving for ?'s reveals that a = (\u03c9; 1, 02, \u03c9, 02, \u03c9 2,\n05 ) satisfies ha|bi = \u03c9\u0304 \u2212 1, so R has the root a + b = (2 + \u03b8; 0, \u221212, \u03c9, 02,\n\u2212\u03c9\u0304 2 , 15 ).\nNow we can prove the second claim of the lemma. If r is in the first\nset of roots specified, then R has r by step 4 and \u03c1+r = (\u03b8\u0304\u03c9\u0304; 13 , \u2212\u03c9 3 , 07)\nby step 1. If r is in the second set of roots, then R has r by step 2 and\n\u03c1 + r = (\u22122 + \u03c9; \u2212\u03c9 4 , 03, 16 ) by step 5.\nFinally, we prove that the differences of the r's span \u03c1\u22a5 . We will only\nneed the second batch of roots briefly, so we define N to be the span\nof the differences of the pairs of roots from the first batch. It consists\nof vectors of the form (0; . . . ). Now we note that a root from the first\nbatch, minus one from the second, has the form (1; . . . ). Therefore it\nsuffices to show that N equals the set X of all vectors (0; x1 , . . . , x13 ) \u2208\nL that are orthogonal to \u03c1, which is to say that x1 + * * * + x13 = 0. We\nwill restrict attention to the last 13 coordinates.\nBegin by labeling the lines of P 2 F3 by l1 , . . . , l13 , and write rij for the\nroot (2+\u03b8; 03, \u03c9\u0304 3 , \u221217 ) from the first batch, with the 0's on li and the \u03c9\u0304's\non lj . Then N contains the vectors \u03b4ij = \u2212\u03c9(rij \u2212rji ) = (0; 13 , \u221213 , 07 ).\nThe span of the \u03b4ij is easy to understand, because if i, j, k and l are\n\n\fON THE Y555 COMPLEX REFLECTION GROUP\n\n15\n\nall distinct, then \u03b4ij = \u2212\u03b4ji , |\u03b4ij |2 = 6, h\u03b4ij |\u03b4jk i = \u22123 and h\u03b4ij |\u03b4kl i = 0.\nIt follows that N \u2297 C admits a coordinate system using 13 coordinates\nsumming to 0, in which \u03b4ij = (\u03b8, \u03b8\u0304, 011 ) with \u03b8 in the ith spot and \u03b8\u0304\nin the jth. (One just checks that the inner products of these vectors,\nunder the standard pairing, are the same as those of the \u03b4ij .) Write\nM for the span of the \u03b4ij ; L3 (3) acts on this coordinate system by\npermuting coordinates as it permutes the lines of P 2F3 .\nNow, N is strictly larger than M, because computation shows that\nif i, j and k are general lines, then hrij \u2212 rjk |\u03b4ik i \u2208\n/ 3E. We can apply\nlemma 6 to both N and X and conclude from the uniqueness proven\nthere that N = X. (We have also shown that N = X admits an\nautomorphism exchanging the vectors of the form (\u03b8, \u03b8\u0304, 011 ) with those\nof the form (13 , \u221213 , 07).)\n\u0003\n\nProof of theorem 1: It remains only to prove R = Aut L. The primitive\nnull vector \u03c1 of lemma 9 has Leech type, because theorem 4 tells us that\nthe complex Leech lattice is the only Eisenstein Niemeier lattice whose\nautomorphism group contains L3 (3). Lemmas 8 and 9 assure us that R\ncontains the unipotent radical of the stabilizer of \u03c1 (U from the proof\nof lemma 8). This acts transitively on the roots r \u2208 L with hr|\u03c1i = \u03b8,\nso R contains all their triflections. Then the proof of theorem 4.1 of\n[2] shows that R acts transitively on null vectors of Leech type, so R\ncontains the triflections in every root having inner product \u03b8 with some\nnull vector of Leech type. (These are all the roots of L by [4, prop. 4.3],\nbut we don't need this.) The triflections in the point roots obviously\nhave this property, and those in the line roots do too (by conjugacy).\nTherefore R is exactly the group generated by triflections in the roots\nwith this property, so R is normal in Aut L.\nTherefore R's intersection with the stabilizer H of \u03c1 is normal in H.\nSince we already know that R contains U \u22b3 H, R is determined by its\nimage in H/U \u223c\n= 6Suz . We also know (lemma 7) that R \u2229 H contains\nL3 (3). By the simplicity of Suz , (R \u2229 H)/U \u2286 6Suz surjects to Suz .\nSince 6Suz is a perfect central extension of Suz , its only subgroup\nsurjecting to Suz is itself. Therefore (R \u2229 H)/U = 6Suz . It follows\nthat R \u2229 H is all of H. We have shown that R acts transitively on the\nprimitive null vectors of Leech type, and contains the full stabilizer of\none of them. So R = Aut L.\n\u0003\nRemark. One can recover Wilson's L3 (3)-invariant description of the\ncomplex Leech lattice \u039bE24 (see the end of [9]) by writing down generators for \u03c1\u22a5 and then adding suitable multiples of \u03c1 to shift them into\nM \u2297E C, where M is from the proof of lemma 9.\n\n\f16\n\nDANIEL ALLCOCK\n\nRemark. We observed that \u03c1 has Leech type. One can show by patient\ncalculation that (\u03b8; \u03b8, 012 ) has E6 type, (\u03b8; \u03b8\u0304, 012 ) has A2 type, (3 +\n\u03c9; 14, \u221213 , 06 ) has D4 type, and (2\u03b8; \u03b84 , 09 ) has E8 type. (In the last\ncase, we specify that the four \u03b8's are at 4 points of P 2 F3 in general\nposition.)\nReferences\n[1] D.
