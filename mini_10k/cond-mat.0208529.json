Charge recombination is the fundamental process of interest in organic light emitting diodes\n(OLEDS). Electroluminescence (EL) in OLEDS results\nfrom, (a) the injection of electrons and holes into thin\nfilms containing the emissive material, (b) migration of\nthese charges, which can involve both coherent motion\non a single chain and interchain or intermolecular chargetransfer between neutral and charged species, (c) recombination of electrons and holes on the same polymer chain\nor molecule1,2,3 . If the recombination leads to the singlet\noptical exciton, light emission can occur. If, on the other\nhand, the final product of the recombination is a triplet\nexciton, only nonradiative relaxation can occur in the\nabsence of strong spin-orbit coupling. EL in OLEDS is\nof strong current interest, both because of applications\nin display devices4,5 and the potential for obtaining organic solid state lasers6 . The fundamental process that\noccurs in photoinduced charge-transfer is the exact reverse of that in EL: optical excitation to the singlet exciton in a donor molecule is followed by charge separation and migration of charge to a neighboring acceptor\nmolecule. The latter process is of interest in photovoltaic\napplications7 .\n\nThe fundamental electronic process of charge recombination or separation is therefore of strong current interest. Especially in the context of EL in OLEDS, charge\nrecombination has received both experimental and theoretical attention (see below). The overall quantum efficiency of the EL depends on, (i) the fraction of the total\nnumber of injected carriers that end up as excitons on\nthe same polymeric chain or molecule, (ii) the fraction\nof these excitons that are spin singlets, since only singlet\nexcitons are emissive, and (iii) the fraction of singlet excitons that actually undergo radiative decay. In the present\npaper we focus on (ii), which determines the maximum\npossible EL efficiency.\nFormally, the charge recombination process can be\nwritten as,\nP + + P \u2212 \u2192 G + S/T\n\n(1)\n\nwhere P \u00b1 are charged polaronic states of the emissive\nmolecule, G is the ground state of the neutral molecule,\nand S and T are singlet and triplet excited states of the\nneutral molecule. Eq. 1 indicates that both singlet and\ntriplet excitons are likely products of the charge recombination process. We shall denote the fraction of singlet\nexcitons generated in OLEDS by the above recombination process as \u03b7.\nEarly discussions of \u03b7 were based on statistical arguments alone. Since electrons and holes are injected independently from the two electrodes, and since two spin-1/2\nparticles can give three independent spin 1 states (with\n\n\f2\nMS = \u20131, 0 and +1) but only one spin 0 state (MS =\n0), it follows that \u03b7 is 0.25. Note, however, that this argument is strictly valid only for noninteracting electrons,\nsuch that single-configuration molecular orbital descriptions of all eigenstates are valid. In such a case, the\nhighest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) are identical for the singlet\nand triplet excited states. Charge recombination (Eq. 1)\nthen involves merely the migration of an electron from\nthe doubly (singly) occupied HOMO (LUMO) of P \u2212 to\nthe singly occupied (unoccupied) HOMO (LUMO) of the\nP + , for both singlet and triplet channels. The singlet\nchannel and all three triplet channels of the charge recombination process are equally likely within the MO\nscheme. If electrons are interacting, however, this simple\nsingle-configuration description breaks down, as all the\nstates included in Eq. 1 are now superpositions of multiple configurations. There is no longer any fundamental\nreason for the singlet and triplet channels to be equally\nlikely processes, and hence there is no reason for \u03b7 to be\n0.25.\nExperimentally, \u03b7 has been found to range from \u223c 0.25\n\u2013 0.668,9,10,11 in different materials. In OLEDS with the\nmolecular species Aluminum tris (8-hydroxyquinoline)\n(Alq3 ) as the emissive material Baldo et. al. have determined \u03b7 \u223c 0.22 \u00b1 0.03, in agreement with that expected\nfrom statistical arguments8. On the other hand, considerably larger \u03b7 \u223c 0.45 has been found in derivatives of\npoly(para-phenylenevinylene) (PPV) by Cao et al. and\nHo et. al.9,10 . Wohlgenannt et. al., using spin-dependent\nrecombination spectroscopy, have determined the formation cross-sections of singlet and triplet excitons, \u03c3S and\n\u03c3T , respectively, for a large number of polymeric materials (including nonemissive polymers in which the lowest\ntwo-photon state 2Ag occurs below the optical 1Bu exciton), and found that \u03c3S /\u03c3T is strongly material dependent and in all cases considerably larger than 1 (thereby\nimplying that \u03b7 is material dependent and much larger\nthan 0.25)11 . More recently, Wilson et al.12 and Wohlgenannt et. al.13 have shown that \u03b7 can depend strongly\non the effective conjugation length, with values ranging\nfrom \u223c 0.25 for small monomers to considerably larger\nthan 0.25 for long chain oligomers.\nTheoretically, \u03b7 has been investigated by a number of\ngroups11,14,15,16,17 including ourselves. There is general\nagreement that \u03b7 can be substantially greater than 0.25\nin \u03c0-conjugated polymers and that this is an electron\ncorrelation effect. There exist, however, substantial differences between the assumptions and formalisms that\ngo into these theories. The goal of the present work is to\ndevelop a formalism that gives a clear physical picture of\nthe electron-hole recombination and explains why \u03b7 substantially larger than 0.25 is to be expected in organic\npolymeric systems. Ideally, since photoinduced chargetransfer is the exact reverse process of electron-hole recombination, it should also be possible to extend our\napproach to photoinduced charge-transfer in the future.\nBrief presentation of our work has been made earlier11 ,\n\nwhere, however, the emphasis was more on the experimental technique used by our experimental collaborators.\nHere we present the full theoretical details of our earlier\nwork, provide a critique of the earlier theories and also\nreport on the new and interesting results of our investigation of external electric field effects on \u03b7, albeit for\nartificially large fields, and also on the role of nitrogen\nheteratoms in electron\u2013hole recombination. Specifically,\nour theoretical approach involves a time-dependent formalism, within which the initial state composed of two\noppositely charged polarons is allowed to propagate in\ntime under the influence of the complete Hamiltonian\nthat includes both on-chain and interchain interactions.\nFor the sake of completeness, we also discuss other existing theoretical approaches14,15,16,17 , and their applicability to real systems. In particular, there exists a superficial\nsimilarity between the approach used in references 16, 17\nand ours. For a physical understanding of the electronhole recombination process it is essential (see below) that\nthe difference between our approach and that used by the\nauthors of reference 16, 17 is precisely understood.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In section II, we\npresent our theoretical models for intrachain and interchain interactions, and also discuss the model systems\nthat are studied. In section III we present a brief critique of the existing theories. A more extended discussion of the approach used by Shuai et. al.16,17 is given\nin Appendix 1. In section IV we present the method of\npropagation of the initial state, while in section V we\npresent our numerical results. In this section we also discuss an alternate approach to the time propagation for\nthe simplest case of two ethylenes that confirms the validity of the more general approach used in section IV,\nand that also gives a physical picture of the recombination process. While \u03b7 > 0.25 is found in our calculations\nwith interacting electrons, the absolute yields of both singlet and triplet excitons are found to be extremely small\nwith standard electron correlation parameters. We therefore investigate the effects of the external electric field on\nthese yields within a highly simplified model. It is found\nthat for sufficiently large fields the yields with interacting electrons are as large as those with noninteracting\nelectrons in the field-free case, and that in the relatively\nsmall field region \u03b7 continues to be greater than 0.25. In\nthe very high field regime it is found that \u03b7 can even\nbe smaller than 0.25. While the bare electric fields required to see the reversal of the singlet-triplet ratio are\nrather large and therefore only of academic interest, if\ninternal field effects are taken into account, it is possible to envisage situations where the effective electric\nfield is large enough to bring about such a reversal in\nthe singlet-triplet ratio. Following the discussion of electric field effects, we discuss how the chain length dependence of \u03b7, as observed experimentally12,13 , can be understood within our theory. We then consider the role of\nheteroatoms, especially in the context of molecular emitters. We show that in small systems with heteroatoms \u03b7\ncan approach the statistical limit, thus explaining quali-\n\n\f3\ntatively the monomer results of Wilson et. al.12 , and the\nresults of Baldo et. al. for Alq3 8 . The emphasis in all our\ncalculations is on understanding the qualitative aspects\nof charge recombination and not on detailed quantitative\naspects. Finally in section VI we discuss the conclusions\nand scope of future work.\n\nII.\n\nTHEORETICAL MODEL\n\nThe goal of the present work is to provide benchmark results for the charge recombination reaction which\nare valid for the strong Coulomb interactions that characterize \u03c0-conjugated systems. Accurate treatments of\nelectron-electron interactions are not possible for long\nchain systems, and in this initial study we have therefore\nchosen pairs of short polyene chains, with 2 \u2013 6 carbon\natoms in each chain as our model systems. Since polyene\neigenstates possess mirror-plane and inversion symmetries, we shall henceforth refer to the ground state G\n(see Eq. 1) as 11 Ag , and S and T as 11 Bu and 13 Bu , respectively. The model system containing two hexatrienes\n(12 carbon atoms overall) is the largest system that can\nbe treated exactly at present within correlated electron\nmodels.\nOur approach suffers from two apparent disadvantages.\nFirst, polyenes and polyacetylenes are weakly emissive\nbecause the 21 Ag state in these occur below the optical 11 Bu state. This presents no problem as far as the\nanalysis of the EL in emissive materials is concerned,\nas the spectroscopic technique of Wohlgenannt et. al.11\nfind a strong deviation of \u03c3S /\u03c3T from 1 even in systems\nwith energy ordering similar to that in polyenes11 (see\nresults for PTV in this paper, for instance), and as we\nshow in the following, this is a direct consequence of the\nlarge energy difference between the singlet 11 Bu exciton\nand the triplet 13 Bu exciton, as well as the fundamental\ndifference in their electronic structures. Both, in turn,\nare consequences of strong electron-electron interactions,\nwhich also characterize systems like PPV and polyparaphenylene (PPP), as evidenced from the large difference in energies between the singlet and triplet excitons\nin these systems, determined experimentally18,19,20,21 , as\nwell as theoretically22,23 . A second apparent disadvantage of our procedure is related to the limitation of our\ncalculations to short systems. This prevents direct evaluation of the chain length dependence of \u03b7. We believe\nthat this problem can be circumvented once the mechanism of the physical process that leads to the difference between singlet and triplet generation is precisely\nunderstood, and for this purpose it is essential that the\nelectron correlation effects are investigated thoroughly\nusing exactly solvable models. As we show later, our approach gives a precise though qualitative explanation of\nthe chain length dependence.\nOur model system consists of two polyene chains of\nequal lengths that lie directly on top of each other, separated by 4 \u00c5. We consider the charge recombination\n\nprocess of Eq. 1, and there are two possible initial states:\n(i) a specific chain (say chain 1) is positively charged,\nwith the other (chain 2) having negative charge, a configuration that hereafter we denote as P1+ P2\u2212 , where the\nsubscripts 1 and 2 are chain indices, or (ii) the superposition P1+ P2\u2212 \u00b1 P2+ P1\u2212 , in the same notation. In our\ncalculations we have chosen the first as the proper initial\nstate, since experimentally in the OLEDS the symmetry between the chains is broken by the external electric\nfield (we emphasize that the consequence of choosing the\nsymmetric or antisymmetric superposition can be easily\npredicted from our all our numerical calculations that\nfollow). Even with initial state (i), the final state can\nconsist of both (11 Ag )1 (11 Bu )2 and (11 Ag )2 (11 Bu )1 in\nthe singlet channel. The same is true in the triplet channel, i.e., either of the two chains can be in the ground\n(excited) state. Hereafter we will write the initial states\nas |iS i and |iT i, where the subscripts S and T correspond\nto spin states S = 0 and 1. We consider only the MS =\n0 triplet state. The initial states are simply the product\nstates with appropriate spin combinations,\n\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n|iS i = 2\u22121/2 (|P1,\u2191\ni|P2,\u2193\ni \u2212 |P1,\u2193\ni|P2,\u2191\ni)\n\n(2)\n\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n|iT i = 2\u22121/2 (|P1,\u2191\ni|P2,\u2193\ni + |P1,\u2193\ni|P2,\u2191\ni)\n\n(3)\n\nThere exist of course two other initial triplet states\nwith MS = \u00b1 1. The overall Hamiltonian for our composite two-chain system consists of an intrachain terms\nHintra and interchain interactions Hinter . Additional interactions must be explicitly included to discuss external influences like the electric field etc. Hintra describing individual chains is the Pariser-Parr-Pople (PPP)\nHamiltonian24,25 for \u03c0-electron systems, written as,\nHintra = \u2212\n\nX\n\ntij (a\u2020i,\u03c3 aj,\u03c3 + H.C.) +\n\ni\n\nUi ni,\u2191 ni,\u2193 +\n\n\u01eb i ni +\n\ni\n\n<ij>,\u03c3\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\ni>j\n\nVij (ni \u2212 zi )(nj \u2212 zj ) (4)\n\nwhere a\u2020i,\u03c3 creates a \u03c0-electron of spin \u03c3 on carbon atom\ni, ni,\u03c3 = a\u2020i,\u03c3 ai,\u03c3 is the number of electrons on atom i\nP\nwith spin \u03c3 and ni = \u03c3 ni,\u03c3 is the total number of electrons on atom i, \u01ebi is the site energy and zi are the local\nchemical potentials. The hopping matrix element tij in\nthe above are restricted to nearest neighbors and in principle can contain electron-phonon interactions, although\na rigid bond approximation is used here. Ui and Vij are\nthe on-site and intrachain intersite Coulomb interactions.\nWe use standard parameterizations for Hintra . The\nhopping integrals for single and double bonds are taken\nto be 2.232 eV and 2.568 eV, respectively and all the site\nenergies of carbon atoms in a polymer with all equivalent\nsites are set to zero. We choose the Hubbard interaction\nparameter UC for carbon to be 11.26 eV, and for the Vij\n\n\f4\nwe choose the Ohno parameterization26,\nVij = 14.397\n\n\"\u0012\n\n28.794\nUi + Uj\n\n\u00132\n\n+\n\n2\nrij\n\n#\u2212 12\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the distance rij is in \u00c5, Vij is in eV and the local\nchemical potential zC for sp2 carbon is one. It should be\nnoted then when hetero atoms like nitrogen are present,\nthe on-site correlation energy, the site energy and the\nlocal chemical potential could be different from those for\ncarbon. For Hinter , we choose the following form,\nX \u2020\n(ai\u03c3 a\u2032i,\u03c3 + H.C.) +\nHinter = \u2212t\u22a5\ni,\u03c3\n\n+X\u22a5\n\nX\n\n(ni + n\u2032i )(a\u2020i\u03c3 a\u2032i,\u03c3 + H.C.) +\n\ni,\u03c3\n\nX\ni,j\n\nVi,j (ni \u2212 zi )(n\u2032j \u2212 zj \u2032 )\n\n(6)\n\nIn the above, primed and unprimed operators correspond\nto sites on different chains. Note that the interchain hopping t\u22a5 is restricted to corresponding sites on the two\nchains, which are nearest interchain neighbors. The interchain Coulomb interaction Vi,j , however, includes interaction between any site on one chain with any other\nsite on the other chain. In addition to the usual oneelectron hopping that occurs within the zero differential\noverlap approximation24,25 we have also included a manyelectron site charge-bond charge repulsion X\u22a5 (operating\nbetween nearest interchain neighbors only) that consists\nof multicenter Coulomb integrals. This term should also\noccur within Hintra , but is usually ignored there because\nof its small magnitude, relative to all other terms24,25,27 .\nIn contrast, the t\u22a5 in Hinter is expected to be much\nsmaller, and X\u22a5 cannot be ignored in interchain processes, especially at large interchain separations28. We\nhave done calculations for both X\u22a5 = 0 and X\u22a5 6= 0.\nIII.\n\nBRIEF CRITIQUE OF EXISTING\nTHEORIES\n\nTo put our work in the proper context we\npresent a discussion of the existing theories of charge\nrecombination14,15,16,17 in this section. The natures of\nHintra within all these models are similar in the sense\nthat they all incorporate intrachain Coulomb interactions, without which of course there cannot be any difference between singlet and triplet generation. Following this, there is a fundamental difference between the\nmodels of references 14, 15 on the one hand, and those\nof references 16, 17 and ours on the other. Within the\ntheory of references 14, 15, there is no difference in singlet or triplet generation in the first stage of the chargerecombination process, which involves interchain chargetransfer. Within these models, interchain charge-transfer\nyields high energy singlet and triplet excited states of\n\nlong chains that occur in the continuum, and the lowest singlet and triplet excitons result from relaxations\nof these high energy states. Differences in the relative\nyields of the lowest singlet and triplet excitons are consequences of differences in the intrachain relaxation processes in the singlet and triplet channels, that occur in the\nsecond stage of the overall process. In contrast, within\nour theory11 and the theory of references 16 and 17, the\nlowest singlet and triplet excitons are generated directly\nfrom two oppositely charged polarons, and their different yields are consequences of the different cross-sections\nof the interchain charge-transfer reactions in the singlet\nand triplet channels.\nWithin the model of Hong and Meng14 , the continuum singlet state decays to the lowest singlet exciton,\nwhile the continuum triplet state decays to a high energy triplet state T2 consisting of a loosely bound triplet\nexciton, which then relaxes nonradiatively to the lowest\ntightly bound triplet exciton T1 . The energy gap between T2 and T1 is large, and according to Hong and\nMeng, this nonradiative relaxation has to be a multiphonon cascade process. The large energy gap and the\nmultiphonon nature of the relaxation creates a \"bottleneck\" in the T2 \u2192 T1 nonradiative transition, and spinorbit coupling leads to intersystem crossing from T2 to\nthe singlet exciton, thereby increasing the relative yield\nof singlets14 . We believe that the key problem with this\napproach is that the model is in disagreement with what\nis known about the spectrum of triplet states from triplet\nabsorptions in \u03c0-conjugated polymers20 and theoretical\nsolutions to the PPP model23 . Experimentally, in PPV,\nfor instance, the lowest triplet occurs at about 1.55 eV20 ,\nwhile in MEH-PPV this state occurs at \u223c 1.3 eV18 . The\ntriplet absorption energy in these systems is about 1.4\neV. Theoretically, the final state in triplet absorption occurs slightly below the continuum band23 , and this is\ntherefore the T2 state (also referred to as the m3 Ag 20 ).\nThe energy region between T2 and T1 (m3 Ag and 13 Bu )\nin the triplet subspace is not at all sparse, as assumed by\nHong and Meng, but rather, within the correlated PPP\nHamiltonian Hintra in Eq. 4, this energy region contains\nnumerous other triplet states29,30 . Thus any nonradiative relaxation from T2 to T1 in the realistic systems\nshould involve a number of intermediate triplet states\nwith small energy gaps between them, and therefore the\nphonon bottleneck simply will not occur. An additional\nproblem with the model of Hong and Meng is that even in\nthe singlet channel, generation of the lowest exciton from\na continuum singlet state cannot be direct but can occur\nonly through the m1 Ag loosely bound singlet exciton23 .\nIn principle, this can lead to a bottleneck even in the singlet channel. To summarize, we believe that the model\nof Hong and Meng is in disagreement with the known\nsinglet and triplet energy spectra within the PPP model.\nWithin the model of Kobrak and Bittner15 also polaron pairs are formed on the single chain first. These\nauthors take into account the electron-phonon interactions explicitly, and the two-particle states on a single\n\n\f5\nchain are allowed to evolve by interacting with a onedimensional classical vibrational lattice. Different crosssections for singlet and triplet excitons are found within\nthe authors' model, and the difference originates from the\ndifference in the mixing between the polaron and exciton\nstates with different spin. The theory includes only the\nCoulomb interactions between the polaron charges and\nnot the Coulomb interactions between all the electrons\nthat appear in the PPP Hamiltonian. The theory also\nassumes large quantum efficiency for the generation of\nthe high energy states with the two polaron charges on\nthe same chain, starting from a state with the charges on\ndifferent chains. A recent calculation by Ye et. al.17 indicates very weak cross-sections for the generation of high\nenergy 1 Bu and 3 Bu states starting from the initial state\ncontaining the charges on different chains (see Fig. 8 in\nreference 17). This is supported also by our exact calculations (see below). However, the calculations by Ye et\nal.17 as well as ours are for relatively short chains, and\nfurther work is needed to test the validity of the model\nof Kobrak and Bittner. As we show in section V, \u03b7 >\n0.25 is predicted from considerations of the initial stage\nof interchain charge-transfer alone. Whether additional\ncontributions can come from differences in the intrachain\nrelaxation processes needs to be studied further.\nWe now come to the work by Shuai et. al.16,17 ,\nwho, like us, have determined \u03b7 > 0.25 in oligomers of\nPPV from considerations of interchain charge-transfer.\nPrecisely because of the apparent similarity of our approaches, it is essential that we discuss the approach of\nShuai et. al. in detail, since our ultimate goal is to arrive at a physical explanation of the greater yield of the\nsinglet exciton than what is predicted from statistical\nconsiderations, and as we show later, the physical mechanisms within references 16, 17 and within our work are\nquite different. The quantity that is calculated in references 16, 17 is \u03c3S /\u03c3T , viz., the ratio of the formation\ncross-sections of the 11 Bu singlet and 13 Bu triplet exciton. For fast spin-lattice interaction, the expression for\n\u03b7 in terms of \u03c3S and \u03c3T can be written as11,13 ,\n\u03b7 = \u03c3S /(\u03c3S + 3\u03c3T )\n\n(7)\n\nand thus, for \u03c3S /\u03c3T > 1, \u03b7 > 0.25.\nShuai et. al. consider the same Hintra as us, and\nHinter that is similar (see below). The authors then use\nthe Fermi \"Golden Rule\" approach to calculate \u03c3S and\n\u03c3T . According to the authors, the cross-section ratio is\ngiven by,\n\u03c3S /\u03c3T = |hiS |Hinter |fS i|2 /|hiT |Hinter |fT i|2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere |iS i and |iT i are the singlet and triplet initial states\n(see Eqs. 2 and 3), and |fS i and |fT i are the corresponding final states, respectively. Since the interchain\nCoulomb interaction is diagonal in the space of the states\nconsidered in Eq. 8, the authors ignore Vi,j in Eq. 6 but\nretain the other terms. Shuai et. al. find that for X\u22a5\n= 0 in Eq. 6, when the interchain charge-transfer is due\n\nto the hopping t\u22a5 only, the right hand side of Eq. 8 is \u223c\n1, a result we agree with (see Appendix 1). The authors\nthen claim that for nonzero positive X\u22a5 , and for positive\nt\u22a5 (note negative sign in front of the one-electron term\nin Eq. 6), the right hand side of Eq. 8 can be substantially larger than 1. The authors calculated the matrix\nelements in Eq. 8 for pairs of PPV oligomers in parallel\nconfiguration using approximate methods (singles configuration interaction16 and coupled-cluster method17 ), and\nhave found the right hand side of Eq. 8 to show divergent behavior over a broad range of X\u22a5 /t\u22a5 (see Fig. 1\nin reference 16 and Figs. 3, 4, 6 and 7 in reference 17).\nBased on these calculations the authors conclude that a\nmoderate to large X\u22a5 is essential for the experimentally\nobserved large \u03c3S /\u03c3T 9,10,11,12,13 .\nThis result is surprising, in view of the fact that the\nsite charge-bond charge repulsion is spin-independent, exactly as the one-electron interchain hopping in Eq. 6.\nSince this question is intimately linked with the mechanism of charge recombination that we are after we have\nre-examined this issue by performing exact calculations\nfor pairs of polyene chains with lengths N = 2, 4 and\n6. The conclusions from these exact calculations are described below.\nAs discussed above, even with P1+ P2\u2212 as the initial state (with, of course, appropriate spin functions) the final state contains two terms, with one\nof the two chains in the ground state and the other\nin the excited state. Instead of working with different superpositions of the final states we consider \u03c3S\nto be proportional to |hiS |Hinter |(11 Ag )1 (11 Bu )2 i|2 +\n|hiS |Hinter |(11 Ag )2 (11 Bu )1 i|2 . Similarly, \u03c3T is taken\nto be proportional to |hiT |Hinter |(11 Ag )1 (13 Bu )2 i|2 +\n|hiT |Hinter |(11 Ag )2 (13 Bu )1 i|2 . As shown explicitly in\nthe Appendix, the magnitudes of the matrix elements\nof the initial singlet [triplet] P1+ P2\u2212 with (11 Ag )1 (11 Bu )2\n[(11 Ag )1 (13 Bu )2 ] and (11 Ag )2 (11 Bu )1 [(11 Ag )2 (13 Bu )1 ]\nare different for X\u22a5 6= 0, and hence the final states cannot\nbe 1:1 superpositions of these configurations. Note that\nby taking the sums of the squares we exhaust all possibilities automatically. For the conclusions of references 16,\n17 to be valid the calculated \u03c3S /\u03c3T within Eq. 8 should\nnow show strong dependence on X\u22a5 /t\u22a5 (as mentioned\nabove divergent \u03c3S /\u03c3T is implied in references 16,17).\nOur exact results for the three different chain lengths are\nshown in Fig. 1 below, where we see that only for X\u22a5 /t\u22a5\nvery close to 0.5 is \u03c3S /\u03c3T , as calculated within Eq. 8, is\nsubstantially different from 1. At all other X\u22a5 /t\u22a5 the\nRHS of Eq. 8 is very close to 1. Furthermore, except for\nX\u22a5 /t\u22a5 = 0.5 the chain length dependence of \u03c3S /\u03c3T is\nweak. If we now recall that all chain length dependent\nquantities (for example, optical and other energy gaps in\npolyenes29 ) exhibit strongest length dependence at the\nshortest lengths, the conclusion that emerges is that except for the unique point X\u22a5 /t\u22a5 = 0.5, \u03c3S /\u03c3T remains\n\u223c 1 within the Golden Rule approach even in the long\nchain limit.\nIn order to understand this difference from the results\n\n\f6\nof Shuai et. al.16,17 in further detail we present analytic\nresults for the case of two ethylenes (N = 2) in Appendix\n1. These results are important in so far as they begin\nto give a physical picture for the charge recombination\nreaction, even as they indicate that the site charge-bond\ncharge repulsion is not the origin of large \u03b7. The analytic\ncalculations also make the origin of the uniqueness of the\npoint X\u22a5 /t\u22a5 = 0.5 absolutely clear. Indeed it is seen that\nprecisely at this point both \u03c3S and \u03c3T , as defined in Eq.\n8, approach zero. More importantly, the chain lengthindependence, as suggested in Fig. 1 can be understood\nvery clearly from the analytic calculations. Finally, it can\nalso be seen from these calculations that had we taken\nthe initial state to be the superposition P1+ P2\u2212 \u00b1 P2+ P1\u2212 ,\ninstead of only one of these, the \u03c3S /\u03c3T , as calculated\nfrom Eq. 8 would be exactly 1 for all X\u22a5 /t\u22a5 .\nOur basic conclusion then is that the Fermi Golden\nRule approach is not valid for calculations of \u03c3S /\u03c3T or \u03b7.\nThis is to be expected also from a different consideration,\nviz., the Fermi Golden Rule approach is valid for calculations of states that lie within a narrow band, whereas in\nthe present case the energy difference between the initial\nand final states, and that between the singlet and triplet\nexcitons are both much larger than t\u22a5 and X\u22a5 . The\norigin of the difference between our exact calculations\nof matrix elements and the approximate calculations of\nShuai et. al. is harder to ascertain. One possibility is\nthat the polaron wavefunctions are open shell, and approximating these within mean field or limited CI could\nlead to wrong conclusions.\nIn the following sections we therefore go beyond the\nFermi Golden Rule approach to understand the origin of\nlarge \u03b7.\n\nIV.\n\nTIME EVOLUTION OF THE POLARON\nPAIR STATE\n\nA\nstraightforward\nnumerical\nsolution\nof\nHintra + Hinter will merely give the electronic structure\nof the composite two-chain system. Such a calculation\ndoes not contain any information about the relative\nyields of specific final states starting from the initial\ntwo-polaron states. Our approach therefore consists\nof propagating the initial state in time under the\ninfluence of the complete Hamiltonian, and monitoring\nthe time-evolved state to obtain information about the\nfinal products.\nIn principle, given a Hamiltonian, propagation of\nany initial state is easily achieved by solving the timedependent Schrodinger equation. One could use the interaction picture to separate the nontrivial evolution of\nthe initial state from the trivial component which occurs\nas a result of the evolution of the product of the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian of the subsystems31 . In the\ncontext of the many-body PPP Hamiltonian such an approach is difficult to implement numerically. This is because the total number of eigenstates for the two-chain\n\nsystem is very large: the number of such states for two\nchains of six carbon atoms each is 853,776 in the Ms\n= 0 subspace. Obtaining all the eigenstates of the twocomponent system and expressing the matrix elements of\nHinter in the basis of these eigenstates is therefore very\nintensive computationally. It is simpler to calculate the\ntime evolution in the Schrodinger representation, determine the time-evolved states, and project them on to the\ndesired final eigenstates (for instance, |11 Ag i1 |11 Bu i2 ).\nThis is the approach we take.\nWe first obtain the eigenstates |P1+ i, |P2\u2212 i as well as\nthe product states exactly in the valence bond (VB)\nbasis29 (in which the total spin S is a good quantum\nnumber) in order to avoid spin contamination. Following\nthe time-evolution, however, we need to calculate overlaps of the time-evolved states with various final states\n(see below), which is cumbersome within the nonorthogonal VB basis. After calculating the exact spin singlet\nand triplet initial states, we therefore expand these in an\northonormal basis that has only well defined total MS\nvalue.\nHenceforth we refer to the initial states |iS i and |iT i\ncollectively as \u03a8(0) and the time-evolved states as \u03a8(t).\nIn principle, the time evolution can be done by operating\non \u03a8(0) with the time evolution operator,\nU (0, t) = exp(\u2212iHt)\n\n(9)\n\nwhere H is the total Hamiltonian Hintra + Hinter . This\napproach would, however, require obtaining a matrix representation of the exponential time evolution operator,\nwhich in turn requires the determination of the prohibitively large number of eigenstates of the composite\ntwo-chain system. We can avoid this problem by using\nsmall discrete time intervals and expanding the exponential operator in a Taylor series, and stopping at the linear\nterm. Such an approach, however, has the undesirable\neffect of spoiling unitarity, and for long time evolutions\nwould lead to loss of normalization of the evolved state.\nThe way around this dilemma has been proposed and\nused by others32,33 in different contexts and involves using the following truncated time-evolution scheme,\n(1 + iH\n\n\u2206t\n\u2206t\n)\u03a8(t + \u2206t) = (1 \u2212 iH\n)\u03a8(t)\n2\n2\n\n(10)\n\nIn the above equation, on the left hand side, we evolve\nthe state at time (t + \u2206t) backwards by \u2206t/2 while on\nthe right hand side, we evolve the state at time t forward\nby \u2206t/2. By forcing these two to be equal, we ensure\nunitarity in the time evolution of the state. It can be\nseen easily that this time evolution which is accurate to\n\u2206t2\n2 is unitary. For a given many-body Hamiltonian and\ninitial state, the right hand side of Eq. 10 is a vector in\nthe Hilbert space of the two-chain Hamiltonian. The left\nhand side corresponds to the action of a matrix on an\nas yet unknown vector, that is obtained by solving the\nabove set of linear algebraic equations. Further details\nof the numerical procedure can be found in Appendix 2.\n\n\f7\nAfter each evolution step, the evolved state is projected\nonto the space of neutral product eigenstates of the twochain system. The relative yield Imn (t) for a given product state |m, ni = |mi1 |ni2 is then obtained from,\nImn (t) = |h\u03a8(t)|m, ni|2\n\n(11)\n\nIn our case the states |m, ni can be any of the final states\nof interest, viz., |(11 Ag )1 (11 Bu )2 i, |(11 Ag )1 (13 Bu )2 i, etc.\nIt is for efficient calculations of the overlaps (while at the\nsame time maintaining spin purity) in Eq. 11 that we\nexpand our exact eigenstates of the neutral system in\nthe VB basis to the total MS basis. We emphasize that\nImn (t) is a measure of the yield of the state |m, ni at\ntime t and is not a cross-section.\n\nV.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nIn this section we report the results of our calculations\nof recombination dynamics for for pairs of ethylenes, butadienes and hexatrienes, both within the noninteracting\nH\u00fcckel model (Ui = Vij = X\u22a5 = 0) and the interacting PPP model. Following this, we show the results of\nour investigation of electric field effects on the same systems, discuss the chain length dependence of \u03b7, and finally present the numerical results for a model system\ncontaining nitrogen heteroatoms. The calculations for\nthe noninteracting case provides a check of our numerical\nprocedure, and the comparison between the noninteracting and the interacting model allows us to determine the\neffect of electron-electron interactions.\n\nA.\n\nDynamics in the H\u00fcckel Model\n\nWhile there is no difference in energy between singlets\nand triplets in the H\u00fcckel Model, it is nevertheless possible to have spin singlet and triplet initial states |iS i\nand |iT i, as well as singlet and triplet final states. In\nFig. 2 we show the yield for the electron-hole recombination in the singlet channel, for pairs of ethylenes,\nbutadienes and hexatrienes. The yields for the triplet\nchannels are not shown separately in this case, \u2013 we have\nascertained that these are identical to those in the singlet channel in this case, as expected. These calculations\nare for t\u22a5 = 0.1 eV within Eq. 6. We note that the\nyields Imn (t) oscillate with time. This is to be expected\nwithin our purely electronic Hamiltonian, within which\nan electron or hole jumps back and forth between the\ntwo molecular species. These oscillations are the analogs\nof the Rabi oscillations34,35 that occur upon the stimulation of a system with light, where absorption of light\ncan occur only with nonzero damping. Within our purely\nelectronic Hamiltonian, complete transition to the final\nstates can only occur in the presence of damping (for\nexample, radiative and nonradiative relaxations of the final states), that has not been explicitly included in our\n\nHamiltonian. The frequency of oscillation is higher for\nlarger intermolecular transfer integral t\u22a5 , as expected.\nThe frequency of the oscillation also depends upon the\nsize of the molecule and is lower for larger molecules (see\nbelow for an explanation of this). The equalities in the\nyields of the singlet and triplet excited states found numerically conforms to the simple free spin statistics which\npredicts that in the MS = 0 state formed from electronhole recombination, the probability of singlet and triplet\nformation are equal. Since the MS = \u00b11 cases always\nyield triplets, the spin statistics corresponding to 25%\nsinglets and 75% triplets is vindicated in this case.\nAlthough the H\u00fcckel calculations do not yield any new\ninformation, it is useful to pursue them further in order\nto arrive at a physical mechanism of the charge recombination process. To this end we have developed an alternate procedure for calculating the above dynamics for\nthe smallest model system, viz., a pair of ethylenes. This\nalternate approach consists of expanding the initial state\n\u03a8(0) as a superposition of the eigenstates \u03c8i of the composite two-chain system with eigenvalues Ei ,\nX\nci |\u03c8i (0)i\n(12)\n|\u03a8(0)i =\ni\n\nThe evolution of the state \u03a8(0) is now simply given by\nX\nci |\u03c8i (0)i exp(\u2212iEi t/h\u0304)\n(13)\n|\u03a8(t)i =\ni\n\nThe yield Imn (t) in a given channel with final state |m, ni\nis then obtained from,\nImn (t) = |hm, n|\u03a8(t)i|2\nX\n|ci hm, n|\u03c8i (0)i exp(\u2212iEi t/h\u0304)|2\n=\ni\n\n=\n\nX\ni\n\n|ci hm, n|\u03c8i (0)i|2 +\n\nXX\ni\n\nj>i\n\n2 Re {ci cj hm, n|\u03c8i (0)ih\u03c8j (0)|m, ni}\n\n\u00d7 cos((Ei \u2212 Ej )t/h\u0304)\n\n(14)\n\nThe quantities hm, n|\u03c8i (0)i are readily obtained from the\neigenstates of the neutral one-chain subsystems and the\ncomposite eigenstates of the two-chain system. In Tables\nI and II we list the nonzero values of the coefficients ci\nand the hm, n|\u03c8i (0)i values for the case of two ethylenes.\nIt is seen that sets of degenerate states of the composite system together contribute equally to the singlet and\ntriplet channels, although individual members of the set\nmay contribute unequally. We have determined that the\ntime evolution obtained from this approach is exactly the\nsame as that obtained from the general method described\nin the previous section.\nThe contribution arising from the right hand side of\nEq. 14 has been separated into time-independent and\ntime-dependent parts. The latter comes about whenever the two eigenstates in question are nondegenerate.\n\n\f8\nTABLE I: Significant ci =< \u03a8(0)|\u03c8i > and the < m, n|\u03c8i >\nvalues and their product in the H\u00fcckel model for a pair\nethylenes in singlet channel.

When the sign of the time dependent part becomes positive the two contributions add up\nto give the maximum yield of 0.25 in both the singlet and\nthe triplet channels observed in the discrete calculations.\nThe periodicity of the oscillation corresponds to the energy difference between the two pairs of the degenerate\nstates. This analysis could in principle be extended to\nthe case of the larger systems but would be quite tedious\nin view of the larger Hilbert space dimensions. Note that\nthe decrease of the oscillation frequency of Imn (t) with\nincreasing chain length (Fig. 2) is explained within the\nabove alternate procedure. The length dependence of the\noscillation frequency originates from the smaller (Ei \u2212Ej )\nin longer chains.\n\nB.\n\nDynamics in the PPP model\n\nWe now present our results for interacting electrons\nin Hintra and Hinter . In all cases for the interchain Vi,j\nwe have chosen the Ohno parameters, and the interchain\nhopping t\u22a5 = 0.1 eV. For X\u22a5 , we present the results of\ncalculations with both X\u22a5 = 0 and 0.1 eV.

The\nsame results are shown in Figs 3 (c) and 3(d) for X\u22a5 =\n0.1 eV.\nThe most obvious difference from the H\u00fcckel model is\nthat the yields Imn (t) in both the singlet and triplet channels are considerably reduced in the present cases. Two\nother points are to be noted. First, there is now substantial difference between the singlet and triplet channels,\nwith the singlet yield higher in all cases. Second, the\nstrong differences in singlet and triplet yields are true\nfor both X\u22a5 = 0 and X\u22a5 6= 0. This is in contradiction to the Golden Rule approach16,17 , which ignores the\nenergy difference between the 11 Bu and the 13 Bu . The\nonly consequence of nonzero X\u22a5 is the asymmetry between the yields of (11 Ag )1 (11 Bu )2 and (11 Ag )2 (11 Bu )1\nin the singlet channels, and a similar asymmetry in the\ntriplet channels. Further discussion of this asymmetry\ncan be found in Appendix 1. The overall conclusion that\nemerges from the results of Figs. 3 (a) - (d) is that\nnonzero electron-electron interactions substantially enhances \u03b7.\nIn order to understand the above results in further detail we have also carried out the dynamics calculation for\npairs of ethylenes according to Eq. 14. As in the H\u00fcckel\ncase these calculations yield the same results as the more\ngeneral method. Our results for the wavefunctions of the\ncomposite two-chain system and the overlaps of the product eigenstates of the final neutral molecules with these\nare shown in Tables III and IV. The degeneracies in the\neigenstates of the composite system that characterized\nthe H\u00fcckel model are now lifted, which is a known electron correlation effect. What is more significant in the\npresent case is that the composite state wavefunctions\nthat have large overlaps with \u03a8(0) are now not the same\nones that have large overlaps with the product wavefunctions of the final states. This is what reduces the yields of\nthe charge-transfer processes in the PPP model, relative\nto the H\u00fcckel model.\n\n\f9\nTABLE IV: Significant ci =< \u03a8(0)|\u03c8i > and the < m, n|\u03c8i >\nvalues and their product for PPP model in the absence of\nelectric field, for a pair of ethylenes in the triplet channel.\n2\n3\n10\n12\n19\n20\n31\n33\n\nEi\n-2.7283\n-2.7238\n3.7697\n3.7775\n8.0804\n8.0875\n14.0475\n14.0515\n\nci\n< mn, n|\u03c8i > ci < m, n|\u03c8i >\n-0.0215\n-0.6980\n.0150\n-0.0091\n0.6982\n-.0064\n0.7068\n0.0060\n.0042\n-0.7067\n0.0203\n-.0143\n-0.0056\n0.1115\n-.0006\n-0.0190\n-0.1114\n.0021\n0.0051\n-0.0056\n-.00003\n-0.0052\n-0.0023\n.00001\n\nTables III and IV give a clear physical picture of the\ncharge recombination process. For a large yield what\nappears to be essential is that the composite two-chain\nsystem must have at least some eigenstates which have\nsimultaneously large overlaps with both the direct product\nof the initial polaronic states and the direct product of\nthe pair of eigenstates of the neutral subsystems in the\nthe chosen channel. This can be interpreted as a \"transition state theory\" for the charge recombination reaction of Eq. 1. Large overlaps with the initial polaronic\npair states occur for the states 11 and 13 in the singlet\nchannel (see Table III), and for the states 10 and 12 in\nthe triplet channel (see Table IV). This is in contrast\nto the H\u00fcckel case, where the large overlaps with the\npolaron pair wavefunctions were with the same composite two-chain eigenstates. The overlaps of these specific\ntwo chain eigenstates are larger for products of singlet\nfinal states |11 Ag i1 |11 Bu i2 than for triplet final states\n|11 Ag i1 |13 Bu i2 , and this is what gives a larger yield for\nthe singlet exciton.\nC.\n\nEffects of external electric field\n\nOur results in the previous subsection already indicate that \u03b7 can be substantially larger than 0.25 for the\ncorrelated electron Hamiltonian of Eq. 4. From comparison of Fig. 2 and Figs. 3 (a) - (d), we see however,\nthat the relative yields Imn (t) are lower by orders of\nmagnitude for interacting electrons. This is easily understandable within time-independent second order perturbation theory, within which the extent to which the\ninitial polaron-pair state is modified is directly proportional to the matrix element of Hinter between the initial\nand final states, and inversely proportional to the zeroth\norder energy difference. Since the energy differences between the polaron-pair states and the final neutral states\nare substantial within the PPP Hamiltonian, the yields\nare low. There are two possible interpretations of these\nresults. First, the actual yields of excitons in OLEDS\nis indeed low, compared to the theoretical maximum for\nnoninteracting electrons (recall that no direct compar-\n\nison of the experimental light emission intensities with\nthe theoretical maximum is possible). Second, the experimentally observed yields are influenced substantially by\nexternal factors ignored so far. We consider this second\npossibility here, and calculate within our time-dependent\nformalism the yields Imn (t) in the presence of an external electric field (\"external\" in the following includes the\neffects of both the actual bias voltage as well as all internal field effects). What follows may be thought of as\noverly simple, but nevertheless, we believe that it gives\nthe correct physical picture. We first present our formalism and numerical calculations, and only then we discuss\nthe interpretation of these results.\nAs before, we consider pairs of molecules that are parallel to each other, with the molecular chain-axes aligned\nparallel to the x-axis. The electric field is chosen along\nthe y-axis, such that the total Hamiltonian now has an\nadditional contribution,\nX\n((ni \u2212 1).yi + (n\u2032i \u2212 1).yi\u2032 )\n(15)\nHf ield = E\ni\n\nIn the above E is the strength of the electric field, and yi\n(yi\u2032 ) gives the y-component of the location of the ith (i\u2032 th\ncarbon atom in molecule 1 (2). We now perform our\ndynamical calculations with the complete Hamiltonian\nincluding Hf ield .\nIn Figs. 4 and 5 we show the effect of the external electric field on the yield in the singlet and triplet channels\nfor a pair of ethylenes. We see that in all the cases there\nis a strong nonlinear dependence of the yield on the external field. In both the singlet and the triplet channels,\nwe see sharp increases in the yields over a range of field\nstrengths. The field strengths at which the increases in\nthe yields occur are about two orders of magnitude larger\nthan the experimental fields in the OLEDS, and we comment upon this below. Here we only observe that the\nfield strength E over which the singlet yield is larger is\nsmaller than field strength over which the triplet yield\ndominates.\nWe have performed similar calculations for the longer\nchain systems, and in all cases the effects are the same,\nviz., there exists a range of field strength where a sudden increase in the singlet yield occurs, while at still\nlarger fields there occurs a similar jump in the triplet\nyield. In Figs 6 (a) and 6 (b) we have shown the singlet\nand triplet yields for field strengths of 0.3 V/\u00c5 and 1.0\nV/\u00c5 , respectively, for hexatriene. In general, for a given\nspin channel the threshold field strength decreases with\nthe chain length (the threshold field for the singlet channel decreases from 0.7 V/\u00c5 to 0.3 V/\u00c5 on going from\nethylene to hexatriene, while the threshold field for the\ntriplet channel decreases from 1.6 V/\u00c5 to 1.0 V\u00c5 ). The\nmost important conclusions that emerge from these calculations are that, (a) macroscopically observable yields,\ncomparable to the zero-field yields within the noninteracting H\u00fcckel model, are found for large fields, and (b)\nwhile the calculated \u03b7 are greater than 0.25 for smaller\nfields, this is reversed with further increase in the field\n\n\f10\nTABLE V: In case of a pair of ethylenes the states with\nsignificant ci =< \u03a8(0)|\u03c8i > and < m, n|\u03c8i >, for the PPP\nmodel with electric field of 0.7 V/\u00c5 in the singlet channel.\ni\n4\n5\n11\n21\n27\n30\n\nEi (eV)\n0.5153\n0.6828\n1.0479\n6.5753\n11.2881\n11.6946\n\nci\n< m, n|\u03c8i > ci < m, n|\u03c8i >\n0.2086\n0.7629\n0.1591\n0.3824\n0.4933\n0.1886\n-0.9001\n0.3868\n-0.3482\n0.0005\n-0.0055\n0.0000\n-0.0016\n-0.0577\n0.0001\n0.0040\n-0.1175\n-0.0005\n\nstrength.\nIn order to understand the origin of the increased yields\nover ranges of the electric field, we have analyzed the case\nof a pair of ethylenes extensively, within Eq. 14. Firstly\nit is worth noting that the geometry in which the field\nis introduced, the product states of the neutral Hamiltonian are unaffected by the electric field. We also notice\nthat the eigenvalues of the total Hamiltonian are not very\nsensitive to the external field. As in the field-free cases,\nwe have obtained the projections of the eigenstates of the\ntwo-chain system on the initial state as well as the product of the final states, as a function of the applied electric\nfield in both the singlet and the triplet channels. In Fig.\n7, we plot the coefficients h\u03c8i |m, ni as function of the\nelectric field for the singlet and the triplet channels. We\nsee that there are several states that show strong variation in both cases as a function of the field. However,\nwhen a product of these coefficients with < \u03a8(0)|\u03c8i > is\nanalyzed, the number of the states that simultaneously\nhave a large value of these coefficients at the same electric field is smaller. In Fig. 8, we plot the dominant\ncoefficients of these projections, as a function of the applied field. We note that only a few states have both\nprojections simultaneously large. We also note that both\nthe projections peak at the same field strength. It is this\nthat leads to an abrupt increase in the yield at that field\nstrength.\nThe eigenstates of the full Hamiltonian that have large\nprojections simultaneously to both the initial and the\nfinal states can in fact be expressed almost completely\nas a linear combination of the initial polaron product\nstate and the final product state of the neutral system\neigenstates. In Tables V and VI, we show the projections of the eigenstates of the full Hamiltonian at the\nresonant electric field on to (i) the initial state and (ii)\nto the product of eigenstates of the neutral system for\nwhich resonance is observed. We note that there are a\nfew eigenstates of the full Hamiltonian which have large\ncoefficients for both projections. This seems to be independent of the energy of the eigenstate of the total\nsystem. The energetics decide the period of oscillations\nand not the amplitude of the oscillations.\nWe now come to our interpretations of the above numerical calculations. In all cases the applied fields in\n\nTABLE VI: In case of a pair of ethylenes the states with\nsignificant ci =< \u03a8(0)|\u03c8i > and < m, n|\u03c8i >, for the PPP\nmodel with electric field of 1.6 V/\u00c5 in the triplet channel.\ni\n2\n3\n5\n20\n23\n24\n26\n\nEi (eV)\n-2.8347\n-2.7237\n-2.5174\n7.5928\n8.0821\n8.1387\n10.1769\n\nci\n< m, n|\u03c8i > ci\n0.5927\n0.3031\n0.0052\n0.9142\n0.8053\n-0.2179\n0.0089\n-0.0180\n0.0054\n0.1518\n-0.0031\n0.0364\n0.0001\n0.0163\n\n< m, n|\u03c8i >\n0.1796\n0.0048\n-0.1755\n-0.0002\n0.0008\n-0.0001\n0.0000\n\nour calculations are substantially larger than what is expected from the externally applied voltage in OLEDS.\nNote, however, that our molecules are rather small, and\nthe calculated threshold fields at which the effect becomes observable decrease with the molecular size. In\nthis context, it is worth recalling a previous exact calculation of electroabsorption for short finite polyenes36 .\nThere the electric field was parallel to the chain axis (as\nopposed to perpendicular, as in the present case), and\nit was found that the calculated electroabsorption can\nsimulate the experimentally observed behavior in long\nchain polymers37,38 , provided the electric field used in\nthe short chain calculation was larger by two orders of\nmagnitude than the experimental field. This is because\nof the large energy gaps in short chains. We believe that\na similar argument applies in the present calculations of\ninterchain charge-transfer: the energy difference between\nthe initial polaron-pair state and the final states is much\nlarger in the small molecule-pair system than in the experimental systems, even when oligomeric. The analogy\nto electroabsorption would then imply that the enhanced\nmacroscopic yields would occur in the real systems at\nmuch smaller, perhaps even realistic fields.\nOne final point concerns the geometry used in our calculations. In real OLEDS the relative orientations of\nthe molecules of a given pair, as well as the orientation\nof the electric field with respect to individual members\nof the pair will both be different from that assumed in\nour simple calculations above. Electric fields that are\nnonorthogonal to the chain axis of a molecule will have\neven stronger effects than found in our calculations36 ,\nwhile the random arrangements of the molecule pairs\nwith respect to the field in the experimental systems implies that the range of field over which a given spin channel dominates will be substantially larger than that found\nin our calculations. We therefore believe that a proper\ninterpretation of our calculations is that in the experimental systems, there occur macroscopically large yields\nof both singlet and triplet excitons over a broad range\nof electric field. For small to moderate field strengths,\nthe singlet channel dominates over the triplet channel.\nHowever, at still larger fields it is possible that this situation reverses. Whether or not this higher regime of field\n\n\f11\nstrength is experimentally accessible is a topic of future\ntheoretical and experimental research.\nD.\n\nChain length dependence\n\nWe now discuss the chain length dependence of \u03b7 as\nhas recently been determined experimentally12,13 . From\ncareful measurements using different techniques, Wilson\net. al.12 and Wohlgenannt et. al.13 have established\nthat \u03b7 increases with conjugation length. Wilson et. al.\nhave shown that while \u03b7 is close to the statistically expected 0.25 in the monomer12 , it is substantially larger\nin the polymer. Wohlgenannt et. al. have shown that\n\u03c3T /\u03c3S increases linearly with the inverse of the conjugation length.\nWithin our numerical procedure, it is difficult to determine the chain length dependence of \u03b7 directly. This is\nbecause of multiple reasons, which include, (i) the limitation to rather small sizes, (ii) the necessity to integrate\nImn (t) over a complete period in each case in Figs. 3 (a)\n- (d) to obtain the total yield over that period, and (iii)\nthe difference in the periods for singlet and triplet channels, as well as the differences among different singlet and\ntriplet channels. We therefore present our discussion of\nchain length dependence within a simplified formalism\nthat is consistent with our time-dependent procedure.\nConsider a transition (which could be of the chargetransfer type) between the states |ki and |si of a twostate system, such that at time t = 0 the system is in\nstate |si (cs (0) = 1, ck (0) = 0). We are interested in\nthe yield |ck (t)|2 at a later time t due to a perturbation\nVks . This is a standard textbook problem39 , and the\ntime-dependent Schrodinger equation in this case is,\nih\u0304\n\n\u2202\nck = Vks exp(i\u03c9ks t)\n\u2202t\n\n(16)\n\nFor time-independent Vks , as is true here (Vks in the\npresent case is simply Hinter of Eq. 6) the above equation\nis easily integrated to give,\n|ck (t)|2 = 2|hk|V |si|2\n\n1 \u2212 cos \u03c9ks t\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\n(Ek \u2212 Es )2\n\n(17)\n\nIn our case |si = |P1+ P2\u2212 i, with the appropriate spin\ncombinations, and |ki = |(11 Ag )1 (11 Bu )2 i for the singlet channel, and |ki = |(11 Ag )1 (13 Bu )2 i for the triplet\nchannel (as usual, |ki can also have the chain indices\nreversed). We have already demonstrated (see section\nIII and Appendix 1) that the matrix element hk|V |si is\nnearly the same for the singlet and triplet channels, except near the unique point X\u22a5 /t\u22a5 = 0.5. Ignoring the\noscillation involving \u03c9ks we note that the relative yield of\nthe singlet exciton is inversely proportional to the square\nof \u2206ES = [E(P + ) + E(P \u2212 ) \u2212 E(11 Ag ) \u2212 E(11 Bu )], while\nthat of the triplet exciton is inversely proportional to\nthe square of \u2206ET , in which E(11 Bu ) in the above is\nreplaced with E(13 Bu ) (note, however, that within the\n\ntwo-state approximation we have assumed that the singlet and triplet states that are of interest are the lowest\nsinglet and triplet states; this can only be justified by the\ncomplete many-state calculations of the previous subsections). We see immediately that this simple two-state\nformalism predicts higher singlet yield, since E(11 Bu )\nis considerably higher than E(13 Bu ). Importantly, the\nchain-length dependence of \u03b7 is also understood from the\nabove. Both \u2206ES and \u2206ET decrease with increasing\nchain length. However, the ratio \u2206ES /\u2206ET also decreases, because of the covalent character of the 13 Bu\nand the ionic character of the 11 Bu . This is seen most\neasily in the limit of the simple Hubbard model for the\nindividual chains (zero intersite Coulomb interaction and\nzero bond alternation in Eq. 4), where \u2206ES approaches\n0 and \u2206ET approaches U in the long chain limit.\nWe have calculated \u2206ES and \u2206ET exactly for all chain\nlengths N = 4 - 10 within the PPP-Ohno potential.\nWhile the ratio \u2206ET /\u2206ES shows the correct qualitative trend (viz., increasing \u2206ET /\u2206ES with increasing\nN) necessary for increasing \u03b7 with increasing N, the actual variation is small. This is to be expected, since our\nchain length variation is small, and the Ohno potential\ndecays very slowly. With our limitation on N, it is necessary that the Coulomb potential is short range, such\nthat we have the same Hamiltonian at all chain lengths,\nas is approximately true for the experimental systems\ninvestigated12,13 . We have therefore done exact calculations of \u2206ES and \u2206ET for the extended Hubbard Hamiltonian (Vij in Eq. 4 limited to nearest neighbor interaction V ) with parameters tij = 1.08t0 and 0.92t0 for double and single bonds, V /t0 = 2 and U/t0 = 5 and 6. In\nFig. 9 we show our calculated results for \u2206ET /\u2206ES for\nthe two cases, for different N. In both cases, increasing\n\u2206ET /\u2206ES with increasing N indicates larger \u03b7 for longer\nchain lengths. Energy convergences are faster with larger\nU , which explains the steeper behavior of \u2206ET /\u2206ES for\nlarger U , and gives additional support to our argument.\n\nE.\n\nRole of heteroatoms\n\nThe experiments by Baldo et. al.8 and Wilson et.\nal.12 both indicate that in small molecular systems \u03b7\ncan be close to 0.25. This is in contrast to our results\nfor ethylene (see Fig. 3). for which \u03b7 is calculated to\nbe substantially larger. One reason for this might be\nthat the Coulomb correlation effects in thin film samples are smaller than within the PPP Hamiltonian due\nto intermolecular interactions. The dominant effect, however, is due to the heteroatoms in the molecules investigated by these authors, as we show below. Specifically,\nthe site-energy (electronegativity) difference between the\nheteroatom and carbon atoms makes these systems closer\nto the H\u00fcckel limit and this is what decreases \u03b7.\nIn order to compare with the model polyene systems we\nconsider pairs of (CH=N)2 in the following calculations.\nThe single chain Hamiltonian (Eq. 4) is then modified as\n\n\f12\nfollows40 . The Hubbard U for the nitrogen atoms, UN =\n12.34. eV. The local chemical potential zN for nitrogen\nwith \u03c0 lone pair involved in conjugation is 2. Finally,\nnitrogen has site energy \u01eb = \u2013 2.96 eV relative to that of\nthe carbon atoms. There are two possible arrangements\nfor the two chains in a parallel configuration, (i) carbon\n(nitrogen) on one chain lying directly above carbon (nitrogen) atom on the other, and (ii) carbon atom on one\nchain lying above nitrogen atom on the second chain. We\nhave chosen arrangement (i), \u2013 there is no fundamental\nreason for arrangement (ii) to have a very different \u03b7.\nIn Figs. 10 (a) and (b) we have plotted the Imn (t)\nfor the singlet and triplet channels, respectively, for the\ncase of X\u22a5 = 0. Figs. 10 (c) and (d) show the same\nfor X\u22a5 = 0.1 eV. The most important conclusion that\nemerges from these calculations is that the relative yields\nof triplets are substantially larger in the present case, so\nmuch so that \u03b7 can be even close to the statistical limit\nof 0.25 (note that there are three triplet channels and\nthe figures show the results for only one of these). We\nbelieve that these results give a qualitative explanation\nof the observation of Baldo et. al.8 . Taken together with\nthe chain length dependence of \u03b7, as found in the previous subsection, these results also explain qualitatively\nthe observations by Wilson et. al.12 , since the same chain\nlength dependence found in the case of simple polyenes\nshould be true here also, although it is conceivable that\nrate of increase of \u03b7 with N here may be slower.\n\nVI.\n\nDISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWith a parallel arrangement of two polyene chains,\nwe have shown that several experimentally observed\nqualitative features of the singlet-to-triplet yield ratios\nin \u03c0-conjugated systems can be understood within a\nwell-defined total Hamiltonian for the two-chain system.\nWhile our model systems are rather simple, our theoretical treatment of the charge-transfer process between\nthe two chains is exact. We have given a full timedependent approach to the interchain charge-transfer\nprocess, and have shown that in systems containing only\ncarbon atoms, the overall yield of the singlet exciton is\nconsiderably larger than that of triplet excitons and \u03b7 >\n0.25. This is a direct consequence of moderate electronelectron Coulomb interactions which has strong effects\non both the energies and the wavefunctions of the singlet\nand triplet excitons. The mechanism of the exciton yields\nthat emerges from our calculations is as follows. For\nlarge yields, it is essential that there exist excited states\nof the composite two-chain system whose wavefunctions\nhave simultaneously large overlaps with the wavefunction of the initial state consisting of polaron pairs, and\nthe final state consisting of the two chains in the neutral\nstates. Overlaps of the excited states of the two-chain\nsystem with final states in the singlet channel are considerably larger than for final states in the triplet channel, and this is what gives a large yield for the singlet\n\nexciton. This is a consequence of the different natures\nof the singlet and triplet excitons, which are ionic and\ncovalent, respectively, in the VB notation. Our result\nhere is consistent with experiments on long oligomers and\npolymers9,10,11,12,13 . Although our exact calculations are\nlimited to short chains, within a two-state approximation that is consistent with the full multi-level calculation\nwe have shown that \u03b7 increases with the chain length,\nin agreement with experimental observations12,13 . The\ntwo-state approximation gives an alternate explanation\nof the higher yield of the singlet exciton that is related\nto the singlet and triplet exciton binding energies, which\nare substantially different in \u03c0-conjugated polymers. Finally, we have examined the role of heteroatoms, and\nhave shown that in small molecular systems with nitrogen as the heteroatom, \u03b7 is substantially smaller, and\nmay be even close to the statistically expected value of\n0.25. The wavefunctions in this case, due to the strong\nelectronegativity difference between the heteroatom and\ncarbon atoms, are closer to the H\u00fcckel limit, and this is\nwhat increases the relative yield of the triplet exciton.\nOur results here successfully explain the difference between Alq3 8 and heteroatom containing monomers12 on\nthe one hand, and polymeric systems on the other, and\nthereby provide additional strong support to our theoretical approach.\nThe time-dependent approach to the charge-transfer\nprocess developed here is completely general and can be\napplied to many other similar processes, for example,\nphotoinduced charge-transfer, triplet-triplet collisions in\nOLEDS, etc. These and other applications are currently\nbeing investigated. Similarly, for a more complete understanding of the chain length dependence of \u03b7, we will\ninvestigate charge-transfer process within the density matrix renormalization group technique.\nWhile this manuscript was under preparation we received a manuscript (S. Karabunarliev and E.R. Bittner,\ncond-mat/0206015) from E. Bittner that discusses the\nrelative yields of singlet and triplet excitons within the\ncontext of intrachain processes (see section III) as opposed to the interchain process discussed here. Although\nthe approach of these authors is different from ours, they\nalso find that the relative yields of singlet and triplet excitons are determined by their binding energies (smaller\nbinding energies giving larger yields). It is not clear\nwhether the approach used by these authors applies to\nmolecule-based OLEDS. These authors have also investigated the effect of broken electron-hole symmetry, which\nis related to our calculations on chains of (CH=N)2 . Our\nresults here are different. While Karabunarliev and Bittner find even higher relative yield of singlet excitons\n(compared to electron-hole symmetric case) we find that\n\u03b7 here is smaller (see above). While a complete analysis of the electron-hole recombination must include both\ninterchain and intrachain processes (and is a subject of\nfuture work in this area), we believe that this last result,\nwhen compared to experiments, justify our basic assumption that spin-dependence of the yields of excitons can be\n\n\f13\nunderstood largely within the context of intermolecular\nand interchain charge-transfer.\nVII.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWork in Bangalore was supported by the CSIR, India\nand DST, India, through /INT/US (NSF-RP078)/2001.\nWork in Arizona was supported by NSF-DMR-0101659\nand NSF-INT-0138051.

We also\nbelieve that even as these calculations show the inadequacy of the Golden Rule approach they provide an indirect understanding of the actual mechanism behind large\n\u03b7 in long chain polymers.\nAs in the rest of the paper we consider parallel arrangements of the ethylene molecules, with sites 1 and 2\n(3 and 4) corresponding to the lower (upper) molecule.\nSubscripts 1 and 2 that are assigned to wavefunctions\ndescribe the lower and upper molecule, respectively. The\nrelevant single-molecule eigenstates, corresponding to the\nlower molecule then can be written as\n\u221a\n|11 Ag i1 = (c1 / 2)(a\u20201,\u2191 a\u20201,\u2193 + a\u20202,\u2191 a\u20202,\u2193 )|0i +\n\u221a\n(16a)\n(c2 / 2)(a\u20201,\u2191 a\u20202,\u2193 \u2212 a\u20201,\u2193 a\u20202,\u2191 )|0i\n\u221a\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n|11 Bu i1 = (1/ 2)(a1,\u2191 a1,\u2193 \u2212 a2,\u2191 a2,\u2193 )|0i\n(16b)\n\u221a\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n3\n|1 Bu i1 = (1/ 2)(a1,\u2191 a2,\u2193 + a1,\u2193 a2,\u2191 )|0i\n(16c)\n\u221a\n\u2020\n\u2020\n(16d)\n|P + i1 = (1/ 2)(a1,\u03c3 + a2,\u03c3 )|0i\n\u221a\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2212\n|P i1 = (1/ 2)(a1,\u2191 a1,\u2193 a2,\u03c3 \u2212 a2,\u2191 a2,\u2193 a1,\u03c3 )|0i (16e)\nIn the above |0i is the vacuum for chain 1 and c1 and c2\nare the coefficients of the ionic and covalent configurations in the 1Ag ground state that are to be determined\nby solving for the 2 \u00d7 2 Ag subspace of\n\u221a ethylene within\nthe PPP Hamiltonian (c1 = c2 = 1/ 2 in the H\u00fcckel\nHamiltonian and the matrix elements in Eq. 8 in the singlet and triplet channels are exactly equal in this case).\nWe have chosen the MS = 0 wavefunction for the 13 Bu ,\nbut what follows is equally true for the MS = \u00b1 1 wavefunctions. We have not assigned definite spin states to\nthe charged polaronic wavefunctions, since the charged\nmolecules can have either spin, and since different combinations of these spin states give the initial spin singlet or\n\ntriplet product eigenstates for |P + P \u2212 i. Note, however,\nthe relative minus signs between the two configurations\nin |P \u2212 i, as opposed to the relative plus signs between the\ntwo configurations in |P + i. This is what ensures that the\nproduct wavefunctions of the type |P1+ P2\u2212 i, with positive\ncharge on molecule 1 and negative charge on molecule 2\nhas odd parity with respect to the center of inversion on\na single chain, and charge recombination can therefore\nonly generate neutral states that have odd parity (for\nexample, |11 Ag i1 |11 Bu i2 but not |11 Ag i1 |21 Ag i2 ).\nWe consider the initial states |iS i and |iT i first, which\nare constructed from taking products of the polaronic\nwavefunctions given above. Since these product functions contain four terms each, and also since one of\nour goals is to arrive at a visual representation of the\ncharge recombination process in configuration space, we\nhave chosen not to write their explicit form but have\ngiven in Fig. 11 the wavefunctions in the VB notation,\nwhere a singlet bond between sites i and j is defined\nas 2\u22121/2 (a\u2020i,\u2191 a\u2020j,\u2193 \u2212 a\u2020i,\u2193 a\u2020j,\u2191 )|0i, a triplet bond (with\nan arrow pointing from site i to site j) is defined as\n2\u22121/2 (a\u2020i,\u2191 a\u2020j,\u2193 + a\u2020i,\u2193 a\u2020j,\u2191 )|0i, and crosses correspond to\ndoubly occupied sites a\u2020i,\u2191 a\u2020j,\u2193 |0i. Given the initial and\nfinal states, it is now easily seen that Vi,j in Hinter (Eq. 6)\nplays no role within the Golden Rule approach16,17 , since\nthis term causes no transition between the initial and final states (note, however, Vi,j can play a significant role\nin the full dynamics calculation of section IV). The matrix elements of the remaining terms in Hinter are now\nreadily evaluated and these are given below,\nh(11 Ag )1 (11 Bu )2 |Hinter |P1+ P2\u2212 iS\n\u221a\n\u221a\n= \u2212(c1 / 2)(\u2212t\u22a5 + 2X\u22a5 ) \u2212 (c2 / 2)(\u2212t\u22a5 + X\u22a5 ) (17a)\nh(11 Ag )2 (11 Bu )1 |Hinter |P1+ P2\u2212 iS\n\u221a\n\u221a\n= (c1 / 2)(\u2212t\u22a5 + 2X\u22a5 ) + (c2 / 2)(\u2212t\u22a5 + 3X\u22a5 )\n\n(17b)\n\nh(11 Ag )1 (13 Bu )2 |Hinter |P1+ P2\u2212 iT\n\u221a\n\u221a\n= \u2212(c1 / 2)(\u2212t\u22a5 + X\u22a5 ) \u2212 (c2 / 2)(\u2212t\u22a5 + 2X\u22a5 ) (17c)\nh(11 Ag )1 (13 Bu )2 |Hinter |P1+ P2\u2212 iT\n\u221a\n\u221a\n= (c1 / 2)(\u2212t\u22a5 + 3X\u22a5 ) + (c2 / 2)(\u2212t\u22a5 + 2X\u22a5 ) (17d)\nSeveral points are to be noted now. First, for X\u22a5 = 0, the\nsquares of all the matrix elements are equal, and hence\nthere is no difference between singlet and triplet generation within the Golden Rule approach in this limit, and\nwe agree on this with Shuai et. al.16 Second, however,\ndefining overall \u03c3S as the sum of the squares of the matrix elements in Eqs. 17(a) and and (b), and \u03c3T as the\nsum of the squares of the matrix elements in Eqs. 17(c)\nand (d), respectively, we see that \u03c3S /\u03c3T depends very\nweakly on X\u22a5 /t\u22a5 at all X\u22a5 /t\u22a5 except for X\u22a5 /t\u22a5 very\nclose to 0.5, where \u2212t\u22a5 + 2X\u22a5 = 0 and \u2212t\u22a5 + X\u22a5 and\n\u2212t\u22a5 + 3X\u22a5 have opposite signs. This is particularly so\n\n\f14\nfor the calculated c1 and c2 for PPP-Ohno parameters\n(c1 = 0.5786, c2 = 0.8156). We now examine the different terms in Eqs. 17(a) - (d) in detail. From Fig. 11\nwe note that there are three classes of interchain electron transfers: (i) charge-transfer between sites that are\nboth singly occupied, leading to a doubly occupied site\nor an empty site (denoted by 1 + 1 \u2192 2 + 0, where\nthe numbers denote site occupancies) \u2013 or the exact reverse process, (ii) charge-transfers of the type 1 + 0 \u2192 0\n+ 1, using the same notation, and (iii) charge-transfers\nof the type 2 + 1 \u2192 1 + 2, again with the same notation. These three processes have different matrix elements (\u2212t\u22a5 + 2X\u22a5 ), (\u2212t\u22a5 + X\u22a5 ) and (\u2212t\u22a5 + 3X\u22a5 ), respectively. The role of X\u22a5 now becomes absolutely clear.\nNonzero X\u22a5 creates an asymmetry between the upper\nand lower molecule, leading to a difference between the\nyields of |11 Ag i1 |11 Bu i2 and |11 Ag i2 |11 Bu i1 , but it does\nnot create a significant difference between \u03c3S and \u03c3T .\nAt exactly X\u22a5 /t\u22a5 = 0.5 terms containing (\u2212t\u22a5 +2X\u22a5)\nin the matrix elements vanish, while the other terms are\nalso small and of opposite signs. The singlet channel\nmatrix elements now involve only c2 , while the triplet\nchannel matrix elements involve only c1 . Since for repulsive Coulomb interactions c2 > c1 , the sum of the the\nsquares of the matrix elements here are larger for the singlet channel than for the triplet channel. This is what is\nreflected in our plot of Fig. 8. Note, however, that the\ncalculated yields approach zero in both cases here. It is\nalso clear from Eqs. 17 that this difference between the\nsinglet and triplet channels persist over a very narrow\nregion about X\u22a5 /t\u22a5 = 0.5. We therefore do not believe\nthat this is of any relevance for realistic systems.\nOur final point concerns the chain-length independence\nof our results in Fig. 8 (except near X\u22a5 /t\u22a5 = 0.5). For\narbitrary chain lengths there can occur only the three\nclasses of interchain charge-transfers discussed above (1\n+ 1 \u2192 2 + 0, 1 + 0 \u2192 0 + 1 and 2 + 1 \u2192 1 + 2). The\ndetailed wavefunctions of longer chains are different, but\nthe expectation values hni,\u2191 ni,\u2193 i for the different wavefunctions are nearly the same for fixed intrachain correlation parameters. Thus although in long chains there\ncan in principle occur many more interchain hops that\nare of the type 1 + 1 \u2192 2 + 0, such charge-transfers lead\nto additional double occupancies (relative to the overall initial states) that are energetically costly because of\nelectron correlation effects. Such charge-transfers therefore make weak contributions to the overall interchain\ncharge-transfer. The net consequence is the weak chainlength dependence found in Fig. 1 at all points other\nthan X\u22a5 /t\u22a5 = 0.5.\nWe believe that the above detailed calculation, aside\nfrom indicating the inapplicability of the Golden Rule,\nalso indicates that the proper theoretical treatment must\ninclude the differences in the energies and wavefunctions of the final states, as indeed is done in our timedependent calculations.\n\nIX.\n\nAPPENDIX 2\n\nDetails of the numerical procedure that were not discussed in section V are given below. The charged as well\nas neutral eigenstates of Hintra for individual chains are\nobtained in the VB representation by using a diagrammatic VB approach29 with bit representation of the basis\nstates. The eigenstates of a given spin S are obtained for\nMS = S. The VB eigenstates are then transformed to the\nbasis of Slater determinants with MS = S by expanding\nthe terms in each singlet pair and assigning an up-spin\nat each unpaired site with single occupancy. Thus, a\ntriplet VB basis consisting of two singlet pairs and corresponding to a function with MS = 1 is expanded into\nfour Slater determinants each with MS = 1. To obtain\neigenstate corresponding to other MS values with Slater\ndeterminantal basis, we apply the \u015c \u2212 operator on the\nstate, as many times as is necessary.\nWe use the eigenstates of |P + i and |P \u2212 i to form the\ninitial state of chosen spin in the form,\n\"\n1\n1 1\n1 1\n\u03a81,0 (0) = \u221a | , + i1 \u22c6 | , \u2212 i2 \u00b1\n(18)\n2 2\n2 2 2\n#\n1 1\n1 1\n| , \u2212 i1 \u22c6 | , + i2\n2 2\n2 2\nwhere the subscripts 1 and 0 refer to the total spin of\nthe initial state. The direct product of the states are\nexpressed in the Slater determinantal basis of the composite system with the coefficient ck of the basis state |ki\nin the composite system being given by\nX\nck =\ndl dm < k|l \u22c6 m >\n(19)\nl,m\n\nwhere dl and dm are the coefficients of the basis states\n|li and |mi in the ground states of the subsystems 1 and\n2 respectively. The direct product itself is effected by\nshifting the 2n1 bits of the integer representing the basis\nstate of system 1 with n1 sites to the immediate left of the\n2n2 bits in the integer that represents the basis state of\nsystem 2 with n2 sites. The resulting larger integer with\n2(n1 + n2 ) bits correspond to an integer that represents\none of the basis states of the composite system of (n1 +n2 )\nsites.\nThe evolution of the initial state involves solving the\nlinear algebraic equations, Ax(t + \u2206t) = b, where, the\nmatrix elements of the matrix A and the components of\nb are given by,\n\u2206t\n)\n2\nX\n\u2206t\n(\u03b4ij \u2212 ih\u0304Hij\nbi =\n)xj (t)\n2\nj\n\nAij = (\u03b4ij + ih\u0304Hij\n\n(20)\n(21)\n\nThe matrix A in the largest system we have studied is\nnearly of order one million and for reasonable convergence of the solution of the system of equations we need\n\n\f15\na \u2206t of the order of 0.05eV /h\u0304 which is typically 0.033 femtoseconds, and this guarantees diagonal dominance of the\nmatrix A. Thus, if one wishes to follow the dynamics for\neven as long as say 60 femtoseconds one needs to solve the\nlinear system about 2000 times. This is rendered possible\nby the sparseness of the matrix A. For efficient convergence, we use a small matrix algorithm41 which is very\nsimilar to the Davidson's algorithm for matrix eigenvalue\nproblem. In the case of the largest system size, it takes\nabout twelve hours on a DEC Alpha 333 MHz system to\nevolve the state by 60fs for a given channel.\nAt the end of each iteration in the evolution of the\nstate, we obtain the intensity or the yield in a pair of\n\n1\n\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n9\n10\n11\n\n12\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n19\n20\n\n21\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n25\n26\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n\n30\n\nC.

In all cases the top\npanel corresponds to pair of ethylenes, the middle panel\nto pairs of butadienes, and the bottom panel to pairs of\nhexatrienes.

Evolution in case of hexatrienes is tracked for 20 fs while in other cases, the evolution is tracked for 60fs. Significant yields in singlet\n1 \u2212\nchannel occurs only for final states |(11 A+\ng )1 (1 Bu )2 >\n1 +\n1 \u2212\nand |(1 Bu )1 (1 Ag )2 >, between which the yields are\nidentical in (a) and (b) but different in (c) and (d).\nSimilarly, yields in triplet channel are to the states\n3 +\n3 +\n1 +\n|(11 A+\ng )1 (1 Bu )2 > and |(1 Bu )1 (1 Ag )2 >, between\nwhich the yields are identical in (a) and (b) but different\nin (c) and (d).\nFigure 4 : Yields in the singlet channels (a)\n1\nB\n|(11 Ag )1 (1B\nu )2 i, (b) |(1 Ag )2 (1u )1 i, as a function of the\nelectric field (V/\u00c5) and time (fs) .

The yield to states\n|S1 S0 > in singlet channel and |T S0 > in triplet channel\nare identical to those for |S0 S1 > and |S0 T > in (a) and\n(b) respectively. In (c) the yields to |S1 S0 > and |S0 S1 >\nare not the same and are shown separately. Similarly, in\n(d) yields to |T S0 > and |S0 T > are shown separately.\nFigure 11 : The initial (a) singlet and (b) triplet\nstates |P1+ P2\u2212 i for the case of two ethylenes, and the\nresult of operating with Hinter .
