Introduction\nMost of insight we have gained into the origin of black hole entropy comes from the analysis\nof supersymmetric solutions in supergravity and string theory, an important class of which\nare multicenter black holes (the Majumdar\u2013Papapetrou solutions [1, 2] in the Einstein\u2013\nMaxwell theory can be seen as their precursors). In four-dimensional N = 2 supergravity\ncoupled to vector multiplets the general stationary supersymmetric multi-black holes, also\nknown as black hole composites, were obtained by Denef [3] (extending results of Behrndt,\nL\u00fcst and Sabra [4]; higher-curvature corrections were taken into account by Cardoso, de\nWit, K\u00e4ppeli and Mohaupt [5]). To better understand black holes that are not supersymmetric, however, it is desirable to look for new solutions, in particular those that would\nstill share certain features (such as extremality) with their supersymmetric counterparts,\nso that at least some of the tools developed for the latter could be applied to the former.\nRecently two methods have been used to construct non-supersymmetric extremal multicenter solutions: Gaiotto, Li and Padi [6], following the earlier idea of Breitenlohner,\nMaison and Gibbons [7], through dimensional reduction over the timelike Killing direction\nmapped a class of four-dimensional static multicenter black holes (which includes both\nsupersymmetric and non-supersymmetric solutions) to geodesics on the scalar manifold,\nfor the case when it is a symmetric coset space. The geodesics are then traced by the\nnilpotent generators of the coset algebra. A similar study, but carried out for maximal\nrather than N = 2 supergravity coupled to a single vector multiplet, was later performed\nby Bossard and Nicolai [8]. The same type of dimensional reduction was also the main\ntool of the systematic study by Mohaupt and Waite [9] of conditions under which static\nelectric multicenter solutions in theories with Einstein\u2013Maxwell-type Lagrangians in five\nspacetime dimensions can be expressed by harmonic functions.\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fGoldstein and Katmadas [10] in turn observed that one could break supersymmetry,\nbut still satisfy the equations of motion of five-dimensional extremal supergravity solutions with a four-dimensional Gibbons\u2013Hawking or Taub-NUT base space, by reversing\nthe orientation of the base.1 By spacelike dimensional reduction these authors were able to\nobtain non-supersymmetric multicenter configurations also in four spacetime dimensions.\nSubsequently Bena et al. [12, 13] demonstrated examples of non-supersymmetric multicenter solutions with non-zero angular momentum and non-trivial constraints on the relative\npositions of the centers.\nMeanwhile Gimon, Larsen and Sim\u00f3n [14, 15], motivated by the form of the ADM\nmass formula, provided an interpretation of a single-center extremal non-supersymmetric\nblack hole in the stu model as a threshold bound state (where the binding energy between\nthe components vanishes) of four constituents, each of which is supersymmetric when\nconsidered individually.\nHere, in the context of four-dimensional N = 2 supergravity with cubic prepotentials,\nwe present another way of obtaining extremal non-supersymmetric multicenter solutions,\nwhich directly generalizes Denef and Bates's original supersymmetric derivation [3, 16],\nand which is an application of the superpotential approach, so far employed for singlecenter solutions [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. Figuratively speaking, this method consists\nin replacing the central charge in the equations governing the solution by a different, but\ntypically very closely related quantity, known as the (fake) superpotential. To make the\nmerger with Denef's formalism possible with minimal modification, we restrict ourselves\nto systems, which turn out to have constituents with mutually local charges.\nBefore explaining this technique in more detail in section 3, we will introduce the\nnecessary concepts and notation in section 2. In section 4 we (re-)derive simple examples of\nnon-supersymmetric solutions in the stu model: a single-center solution with non-vanishing\ncentral charge, first obtained by Tripathy and Trivedi [24], and a multi-center solution, of\nthe type conjectured by Kallosh, Sivanandam and Soroush [25]. We also mention how the\nBPS constituent interpretation fits into our framework. The final section 5 summarizes\nand discusses the results.\n\n2. Differential and special geometry\nIn this technical section we are going to briefly recall some basic concepts of special K\u00e4hler\ngeometry [26, 27]-the target space geometry of N = 2 supergravity [28, 29]-needed\nfor finding single-center and multicenter charged extremal black hole solutions in four\nspacetime dimensions, following the formalism employed by Denef for the supersymmetric\ncase. For a more exhaustive exposition we refer the reader to, for instance, [30, 31] and\n[32].\nWe can look at the four-dimensional theory from a higher-dimensional perspective.2\n1\n\nIn fact the equations of motion will remain satisfied also after replacing the Euclidean four-dimensional\nhyper-K\u00e4hler base with a more general Ricci-flat space [11].\n2\nEarly papers on the subject of black hole composites, such as [3, 33, 16], predominantly adopted type\nIIB interpretation; we choose type IIA, common in more recent work, e.g. [34, 35].\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fBy compactifying six of the ten dimensions of type IIA string theory on a Calabi\u2013Yau\nthree-fold X (or, equivalently, type IIB on the mirror of X) one finds [36] an effective\nN = 2 supergravity theory, whose bosonic sector is described by the action\nZ \u0010\n1\nI4D =\nR \u22c6 1 \u2212 2gab\u0304 (z, z\u0304) dz a \u2227 \u22c6 dz\u0304 b\u0304\n16\u03c0\n(2.1)\n\u0011\nI\nJ\nI\nJ\n+ Im NIJ (z, z\u0304) F \u2227 \u22c6 F + Re NIJ (z, z\u0304) F \u2227 F .\n\nIn this action the field strengths are defined as F I = dAI with the index I = (0, a) labeling\nthe abelian gauge fields AI = (A0 , Aa ) of the gravity multiplet and, respectively, the vector\nmultiplets of the theory. The vector multiplets are enumerated by the Hodge number\nh1,1 = dim H 1,1 (X). Each vector multiplet contains two neutral real scalars, combined\ninto a complex scalar: z a = X a + iY a . Hypermultiplets (and the tensor multiplet, which\ncan be dualized to another hypermuliplet) do not play a role in our discussion, hence we\nhave set them to zero.\nThe compactification manifold X is characterized by its intersection numbers defined\nas:\nZ\nDa \u2227 Db \u2227 Dc ,\n(2.2)\nDabc =\nX\n\nwhere the set {Da } comprises a basis of H 2 (X) = H 1,1 (X). Using this quantity, we\nintroduce for any \u03be = \u03be a Da the notation:\nZ\n3\n\u03be \u2227 \u03be \u2227 \u03be = Dabc \u03be a \u03be b \u03be c ,\n\u03be =\nX\nZ\n2\nDa \u2227 \u03be \u2227 \u03be = Dabc \u03be b \u03be c ,\n\u03bea =\n(2.3)\nX\nZ\nDa \u2227 Db \u2227 \u03be = Dabc \u03be c .\n\u03beab =\nX\n\nThe scalar manifold is special K\u00e4hler with the metric:\n!\nZ\n\u0010 4 \u0011\n3 Yab\u0304 3 Ya2 Yb\u03042\n1\n3\na\nD\n\u2227\n\u22c6\nD\n=\n\u2212\n.\n\u2212\n=\n\u2212\u2202\n\u2202\ngab\u0304 =\na\nz z\u0304 b\u0304 ln Y\nb\u0304\n4Y 3 X\n2 Y3\n2 (Y 3 )2\n3\n\n(2.4)\n\nThis equation shows that gab\u0304 = \u2202a \u2202 \u0304b\u0304 K is a K\u00e4hler metric with the K\u00e4hler potential\nK(z, z\u0304) = \u2212 ln 43 Y 3 . In fact both the K\u00e4hler potential and the vector couplings NIJ (z, z\u0304) appearing in (2.1) can be calulated from a single function, the holomorphic cubic prepotential,\nhomogeneous of second degree in the projective coordinates X I (such that z a = X a /X 0 ):\nX a X bX c\n1\n= (X 0 )2 f (z)\nF = \u2212 Dabc\n6\nX0\n\n1\nf (z) = \u2212 Dabc z a z b z c .\n6\n\n(2.5)\n\nMany objects of relevance will be most naturally thought of as taking values in the\neven cohomology of the internal Calabi\u2013Yau manifold X:\nH 2\u2217 (X) = H 0 (X) \u2295 H 2 (X) \u2295 H 4 (X) \u2295 H 6 (X) .\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n(2.6)\n\n\fThe even cohomology has dimension 2h1,1 + 2 and each element E \u2208 H 2\u2217 (X) can be\nexpanded as:\nE = E 0 + E a Da + Ea D a + E0 dV .\n(2.7)\ndV is the normalized volume form on X and {D a } is a dual basis of H 4 (X) such that:\nZ\nDI \u2227 D J = \u03b4IJ .\n(2.8)\nX\n\nWe will make use of the following antisymmetric topological intersection product of\ntwo polyforms belonging to H 2\u2217 (X):\nZ\nE1 \u2227 E2\u2217 ,\n(2.9)\nhE1 , E2 i =\nX\n\nwhere the action of the operator \u2217 on E is simply a change of sign of the 2- and 6-form\ncomponents. The intersection product in terms of components then reads:\nhE1 , E2 i = \u2212E10 E02 + E1a Ea2 \u2212 Ea1 E2a + E01 E20 .\n\n(2.10)\n\nWe define the period vector, an object belonging to H 2\u2217 (X) that entails the quantities\nintroduced so far:\nz 2 Da z 3\n\u03a9hol (z) = \u22121 \u2212 z a Da \u2212 a\n\u2212 dV .\n(2.11)\n2\n6\nA normalized version of \u03a9hol satisfying h\u03a9, \u03a9\u0304i = \u2212i is:\nr\n3\nK/2\n\u03a9(z, z\u0304) = e \u03a9hol =\n\u03a9hol .\n4Y 3\n\n(2.12)\n\nThe period vector \u03a9 transforms under K\u00e4hler transformations with K\u00e4hler weight\n(1, \u22121) and we want its derivative to transform in the same way. To achieve this we define\nits covariant derivatives as:\nDa \u03a9 = \u2202a \u03a9 + 12 \u2202a K \u03a9 ,\nD\u0304\u0101 \u03a9 = \u2202 \u0304\u0101 \u03a9 \u2212 21 \u2202 \u0304\u0101 K \u03a9 = 0 .\n\n(2.13)\n\nThe second relation expresses the covariant holomorphicity of the normalized period vector\nwith respect to the K\u00e4hler connection.\nUsing the normalized period vector one can associate a new quantity, which we decide\nto call fake central charge function, to every element E \u2208 H 2\u2217 (X):\nr\n\u0012 0 3\n\u0013\nE z\nE a za2\n3\na\nZ(E) = hE, \u03a9i =\n\u2212\n+ Ea z \u2212 E0 .\n(2.14)\n4Y 3\n6\n2\nThe name \"fake central charge function\" is given because, when E encodes the electromagnetic charges carried by the vector fields, this object becomes the central charge function\nwhich, at spatial infinity, is the true central charge of the relevant four dimensional supersymmetry algebra.\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fWith the definitions above, the set {\u03a9, Da \u03a9, D\u0304\u0101 \u03a9\u0304, \u03a9\u0304} constitutes an alternative basis\nof H 2\u2217 (X). In fact one can prove the validity of the following equalities:\nh\u03a9, \u03a9\u0304i = \u2212i ,\nhDa \u03a9, D\u0304b\u0304 \u03a9\u0304i = igab\u0304 ,\n\n(2.15)\n\nhD\u03a9, \u03a9i = 0 .\nIn this new basis a constant real element E \u2208 H 2\u2217 (X) can be expanded as:\nE = iZ\u0304(E)\u03a9 \u2212 ig \u0101b D\u0304\u0101 Z\u0304(E)Db \u03a9 + ig ab\u0304 Da Z(E)D\u0304b\u0304 \u03a9\u0304 \u2212 iZ(E)\u03a9\u0304\n\u0002\n\u0003\n= \u22122 Im Z\u0304(E)\u03a9 \u2212 g \u0101b D\u0304\u0101 Z\u0304(E)Db \u03a9 .\n\n(2.16)\n\nLet us finally introduce the operator \u22c4 acting on the basis elements in the following\nway:\n\u22c4 \u03a9 = \u2212i\u03a9 ,\n\n\u22c4 \u03a9\u0304 = i\u03a9\u0304 ,\n\n\u22c4 Da \u03a9 = iDa \u03a9 ,\n\n\u22c4 D\u0304\u0101 \u03a9\u0304 = \u2212iD\u0304\u0101 \u03a9\u0304 .\n\n(2.17)\n\nUsing this new operator one can define a positive non-degenerate norm on H 2\u2217 (X, R) as:\n|E|2 = hE, \u22c4 Ei .\n\n(2.18)\n\n3. Extremal black holes with a superpotential\n3.1 Single-center black holes\nBefore generalizing to multicenter black holes let us consider the case in which all the\nelectromagnetic charges are carried by a single center and let us assume spherical symmetry. All the quantities (scalars as well) depend thus only on the radial coordinate r or\n1\nequivalently on \u03c4 = |r\u2212r\n.

We have the freedom to perform\ntransformations on the charge vector Q \u2192 SQ without changing the value of VBH . This\nfreedom lies in the possibility to choose the symplectic matrix S among all those that\nsatisfy [17]:\nVBH = QT MQ = QT S T MSQ\n\n\u21d2\n\nS T MS = M .\n\n(3.6)\n\nThe sum of squares (3.5) is therefore not unique and one can more generally consider\nthe effective action\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1 \u221e\nIeff = \u2212\nd\u03c4 U\u0307 2 + gab\u0304 \u017c a z\u0304 \u0307 b\u0304 + e2U (W 2 + 4g ab\u0304 \u2202a W \u2202 \u0304b\u0304 W ) \u2212 (eU W )\u03c4 =\u221e ,\n(3.7)\n2 0\nwith W , usually called the fake superpotential, not necessarily equal to |Z|.\nVarying the action we obtain the following first order equations, by construction equivalent to the second order equations of motion:\nU\u0307 = \u2212eU W ,\na\n\n\u017c =\n\n\u22122eU gab\u0304 \u2202 \u0304b\u0304 W\n\n(3.8)\n.\n\n(3.9)\n\nWhen W is equal to |Z(\u0393)| (3.8) and (3.9) describe a supersymmetric attractor flow [38, 37].\n(The name \"attractor\" stems from the fact that the flow has a fixed point determined by\nthe charges, which is reached by the scalars as they approach the event horizon, i.e. when\n\u03c4 \u2192 \u221e.) When W 6= |Z(\u0393)| the flow is non-supersymmetric.\nThe form (3.8) and (3.9) of the attractor equations emphasizes the gradient nature of\nthe flow, but to be able to integrate them directly, another form is more suitable. In the\nsupersymmetric case it follows from the rewriting of the action in yet another way [3] (but\nstill as a sum of squares):\nIeff\n\n1\n=\u2212\n4\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n2\n\u0002\n\u0003\nd\u03c4 e2U 2 Im (\u2202\u03c4 + iQ\u03c4 + i\u03b1\u0307)(e\u2212U e\u2212i\u03b1 \u03a9) + \u0393 \u2212 (eU |Z|)\u03c4 =0 ,\n\n(3.10)\n\nwhere Q\u03c4 = Im(\u2202a K \u017c a ) and \u03b1 = arg Z(\u0393).\nBased on the similarity between supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric equations,\nwe generalize this expression by replacing \u0393 with a different real element of the even\ncohomology of X, say \u0393\u0303. To retain the same form of the expansion (2.16) as that employed\nin supersymmetric solutions,\n\u0393\u0303 = iZ\u0304(\u0393\u0303)\u03a9 \u2212 ig\u0101b D\u0304\u0101 Z\u0304(\u0393\u0303)Db \u03a9 + igab\u0304 Da Z(\u0393\u0303)D\u0304b\u0304 \u03a9\u0304 \u2212 iZ(\u0393\u0303)\u03a9\u0304 ,\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n(3.11)\n\n\fwe limit our analysis to those \u0393\u0303 that have constant real components in the basis {DI , D J }.\nWe can arrange these them in a symplectic vector Q\u0303 = (p\u0303I , q\u0303J ), where Q\u0303 = SQ, so that\n\u0393\u0303 = \u0393(Q\u0303). Consequently, the matrix S is restricted to be real and constant.3\nWith \u0393\u0303 chosen in this way, we can identify the superpotential with the fake central\ncharge function defined in (2.14), when evaluated for \u0393\u0303 as its argument:\nW = |Z(\u0393\u0303)| .\n\n(3.12)\n\n|\u0393\u0303|2 = W 2 + 4g ab\u0304 \u2202a W \u2202 \u0304b\u0304 W .\n\n(3.13)\n\nIt follows that\nDenoting \u03b1\u0303 = arg Z(\u0393\u0303) we can write the effective action (3.7) as\nZ\n2\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1 \u221e\n \u0307 \u2212U e\u2212i\u03b1\u0303 \u03a9) + \u0393\u0303 \u2212 (eU W )\u03c4 =0 ,\nIeff = \u2212\nd\u03c4 e2U 2 Im (\u2202\u03c4 + iQ\u03c4 + i\u03b1\u0303)(e\n4 0\n\n(3.14)\n\nand the attractor equations become, in complete analogy with Denef's original treatment\nof the supersymmetric case:\n2\u2202 \u03c4 Im(e\u2212U e\u2212i\u03b1\u0303 \u03a9) = \u2212\u0393\u0303 .\n\n(3.15)\n\nThe form (3.15) of the attractor equations is suitable for direct integration and gives:\n2e\u2212U Im(e\u2212i\u03b1\u0303 \u03a9) = \u2212H\u0303(\u03c4 ) ,\n\n(3.16)\n\nH\u0303(\u03c4 ) = \u0393\u0303\u03c4 \u2212 2 Im(e\u2212i\u03b1\u0303 \u03a9)\u03c4 =0 .\n\n(3.17)\n\nwith\nThe explicit solution for the scalars is [16]:\nz a (H\u0303) =\n\nH\u0303 a \u2212 i dH\u0303a \u03a3(H\u0303)\nH\u0303 0 + i dH\u03030 \u03a3(H\u0303)\n\n,\n\n(3.18)\n\nand\ne\u22122U (H\u0303) = |Z(H\u0303)|2\n\nz=z(H\u0303)\n\n= W 2 (H\u0303)\n\nz=z(H\u0303)\n\n= \u03a3(H\u0303) ,\n\n(3.19)\n\nwhere the entropy function \u03a3(H\u0303) can be obtained, as in the supersymmetric case, from\nthe entropy of the black hole\nSBH = \u03c0\u03a3(\u0393\u0303) = \u03c0W 2 (\u0393\u0303)\n\n(3.20)\n\nby replacing the charges with harmonic functions.\nThe question we are left with thus concerns the conditions allowing the existence of\nthe constant matrix S. They may be met by truncating the theory to a suitable subset\n3\n\nAlready in [17] it was argued that only a constant matrix S would allow the rewriting of VBH in (3.6)\nas a sum of squares in terms of a superpotential obtained from the central charge by acting with S on Q. In\nour formalism, if S were moduli-dependent, the coefficient of Db \u03a9 (and D\u0304b\u0304 \u03a9\u0304) in the expansion (3.11) would\nhave an additional term (namely \u2212h\u2202a SQ, \u03a9i), and expressing the effective action in a manner analogous\nto (3.10) would not be straightforwardly possible.\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fof the scalar fields. In particular for the stu model it has been shown to mean setting to\nzero the axion fields Re z a and considering magnetic or electric configurations [17]. This\nassumption is the same for the t3 and st2 models4 and all models with cubic prepotentials.\nIn this setting S turns out to be diagonal and acts on the charge vector without changing\nits electric or magnetic character.\nIn what follows we will assume the scalars to be purely imaginary and the charge\nconfiguration to be either (p0 , 0, 0, qa ) or (0, pa , q0 , 0).\n3.2 Multicenter black holes\nFor multicenter configurations the spherical symmetry assumption of the previous derivation is no longer valid and we have to consider more general, stationary spacetimes, by\nincluding in the metric an extra one-form \u03c9 = \u03c9i dxi :\nds2 = \u2212e2U (dt + \u03c9i dxi )2 + e\u22122U \u03b4ij dxi dxj\n\n(3.21)\n\nand taking U and \u03c9i to be arbitrary functions of position x. We require asymptotic flatness\nby imposing U, \u03c9 \u2192 0 when \u03c4 \u2192 0.\nAlthough the idea for obtaining the attractor flow equations remains the same (namely\nthe rewriting of the Lagrangian as a sum of squares), the formalism becomes more involved.\nFollowing with some alterations reference [3], we adopt the boldface notation for threedimensional quantities. The 3D Hodge dual with respect to the flat metric \u03b4ij will be\ndenoted by \u22c60 and for convenience we define w = e2U \u03c9. We also need to introduce the\nfollowing scalar product of spatial 2-forms F and G:\n(F , G) =\n\ne2U\n1 \u2212 w2\n\nZ\n\nX\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nF \u2227 \u22c60 (\u22c4 G \u2217 ) \u2212 \u22c60 (w \u2227 \u22c4 G \u2217 ) w + \u22c60 (w \u2227 \u22c60 G \u2217 ) ,\n\n(3.22)\n\nwhere \u2217 is an operator acting on the elements of the even cohomology of X as defined\nbelow formula (2.9). The product just introduced is commutative and we can assume it to\nbe positive definite taking w small enough.\nWith this notation the effective action reads (dropping the total derivative \u2206U ):\nZ\nZ h\n1\nI4D eff = \u2212\n2dU \u2227 \u22c60 dU \u2212 12 e4U d\u03c9 \u2227 \u22c60 d\u03c9\ndt\n16\u03c0\n3\nR\n(3.23)\ni\n+ 2gab\u0304 dz a \u2227 \u22c60 dz\u0304 b\u0304 + (F, F ) .\nGeneralizing Denef's derivation in the way we did for single-center black holes, we\nintroduce the electromagnetic field strength corresponding to the modified charges \u0393\u0303:\nZ\n1\nF\u0303 = \u0393\u0303 .\n(3.24)\n4\u03c0\n4\n\nIt suffices to compare the BPS and non-BPS attractor solutions of the t3 or st2 model [17, 39]. As for\nthe stu model, once we impose Re z a = X a = 0 and consider the magnetic or electric configuration, the\nsolutions differ only by a switch of sign of the charges-one that would be effected by the matrix S in our\ntreatment.\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fConsequently we define\nG\u0303 = F\u0303 \u2212 2 Im \u22c60 D(e\u2212U e\u2212i\u03b1\u0303 \u03a9) + 2 Re D(eU e\u2212i\u03b1\u0303 \u03a9 \u03c9)\n\n(3.25)\n\nand write the Lagrangian of (3.23) in the form5\nL = (G\u0303, G\u0303) \u2212 4 (Q + d\u03b1\u0303 + 21 e2U \u22c60 d\u03c9) \u2227 ImhG\u0303, eU e\u2212i\u03b1\u0303 \u03a9i\n+ d [2w \u2227 (Q + d\u03b1\u0303) + 4 RehF\u0303 , eU e\u2212i\u03b1\u0303 \u03a9i] .\n\n(3.26)\n\nwith\nD = d + i(Q + d\u03b1 + 12 e2U \u22c60 d\u03c9) ,\n\n(3.27)\n\na\n\n(3.28)\n\nQ = Im (\u2202a Kdz ) .\nImposing the first order equations\nG\u0303 = 0 ,\nQ + d\u03b1\u0303 +\n\n1 2U\n2 e \u22c60 d\u03c9\n\n=0\n\n(3.29)\n(3.30)\n\nsolves the equations of motion. From (3.30) it follows that D = d and then, as by definition\nand our assumption dF\u0303 = 0, differentiating (3.29) leads to\n2d\u22c60 d Im(e\u2212U e\u2212i\u03b1\u0303 \u03a9) = 0 .\n\n(3.31)\n\nThis is a Laplacian equation which integrated gives (cf.

Since we are looking for non-BPS\nmulticenter configurations considering N sources at position xn , it seems reasonable to\ntake as H\u0303(x) a natural generalization of (3.17), namely:\nH\u0303(x) =\n\nN\nX\n\n\u0393\u0303n \u03c4n \u2212 2 Im(e\u2212i\u03b1\u0303 \u03a9)\u03c4 =0 ,\n\n(3.33)\n\nn=1\n\nwith \u03c4n = |x \u2212 xn |\u22121 and \u0393\u0303n = \u0393(Sn Qn ), Sn being constant matrices.\nTo be able to speak of black hole composites, certain conditions need to be satisfied:\n\u2022 A single-center non-BPS black hole of total charge Q and its corresponding attractor\nflow have to exist and be well defined (i.e. they have to be describable with the above\nprocedure).\n\u2022 For each center of charge Qn a single-center attractor flow has to exist as well.\n5\n\nWe assume that the constraints [40] resulting from the components of Einstein's equation not reproduced\nby this Lagrangian will remain satisfied as in the supersymmetric case.\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\f\u2022 The charges must obey the constraints:\nQ=\n\nN\nX\n\nQn ,\n\n(3.34)\n\nn=1\n\n\u0393\u0303 = \u0393(SQ) =\n\nN\nX\n\n\u0393(Sn Qn ) =\n\nN\nX\n\n\u0393\u0303n .\n\n(3.35)\n\nn=1\n\nn=1\n\nIn addition we need to take into account a particular feature of the central charge\nZ, stemming from our assumptions regarding the charges: taking Q = (p0 , 0, 0, qa ) or\nQ = (0, pa , q0 , 0) and imposing Re z a = 0 reveals the central charge to have a constant\nphase. For instance, with Q electric the corresponding central charge reads\nr\n\u0012 0 3\n\u0013\np z\n3\na\nZ(\u0393) =\n+ qa z\n(3.36)\n4Y 3\n6\nand with z a = iY a (where Y a \u2208 R) it holds that ei\u03b1 =\n\nZ\n|Z|\n\n= i.\n\nNote that this is true also for Z\u0303 = Z(\u0393\u0303) whenever the difference between Q and Q\u0303\namounts to constant factors multiplying their components (as is the case when S is a\nconstant diagonal matrix). Then, as a direct consequence of the constancy of \u03b1\u0303, it follows\nin our treatment that d\u03b1\u0303 = 0 and (3.30) in particular becomes:\n1\nQ = \u2212 e2U \u22c60 d\u03c9 .\n2\n\n(3.37)\n\nA different form of flow equations\nLet us bring the attractor equations (3.32) to a form more closely resembling the first order\nflow equations for the scalars and the warp factor (3.8, 3.9). In view of this we define:\nN\nX\n\nN\nX\n\nei\u03b1\u0303n Wn d\u03c4n .\n\n(3.38)\n\nLet us differentiate (3.32) to obtain:\n\u0002\n\u0003\ndH\u0303 = 2 Im (dU \u03a9 \u2212 d\u03a9)e\u2212U e\u2212i\u03b1\u0303\n\u0002\n\u0003\n= 2 Im (dU \u03a9 \u2212 Da \u03a9 dz a + iQ\u03a9)e\u2212U e\u2212i\u03b1\u0303 .\n\n(3.39)\n\n\u03be\u0303 = hdH\u0303, \u03a9i =\n\nZ(\u0393\u0303n ) d\u03c4n =\n\nn=1\n\nn=1\n\nTaking now the intersection product of (3.39) with \u03a9 yields:\n\u2212\u03be\u0303 = (dU \u2212 iQ)e\u2212U ei\u03b1\u0303 ,\n\n(3.40)\n\nQ = eU Im(e\u2212i\u03b1\u0303 \u03be\u0303) ,\n\n(3.41)\n\ndU = \u2212eU Re(e\u2212i\u03b1\u0303 \u03be\u0303) .\n\n(3.42)\n\nand then:\n\nSimilarly taking the intersection product of (3.39) with D\u0304\u0101 \u03a9\u0304 gives:\ndz a = \u2212eU gab\u0304 ei\u03b1\u0303 D\u0304b\u0304  \u0304\u03be\u0303 .\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n(3.43)\n\n\fEquations (3.42)\u2013(3.43) are the multicenter version of (3.8)\u2013(3.9). Recalling our assumptions and in particular using Re z a = 0 we have:\ni\ni\nQ = Im(\u2202a Kdz a ) = \u2212 (\u2202a Kdz a \u2212 \u2202 \u0304\u0101 Kdz\u0304 \u0101 ) = \u2212 (\u2202a Kdz a \u2212 \u2202a Kdz a ) = 0 .\n2\n2\n\n(3.44)\n\nHence, with \u03b1\u0303n = arg Z(\u0393\u0303n ), (3.41) becomes:\n0 = Im(e\u2212i\u03b1\u0303 \u03be\u0303) =\n\nN\nX\n\nn=1\n\n\u0001\nIm e\u2212i(\u03b1\u0303\u2212\u03b1\u0303n ) Wn d\u03c4n ,\n\n(3.45)\n\nthat is \u03b1\u0303 = \u03b1\u0303n (mod \u03c0) for all n.\nAngular momentum and positions of the centers\nIt is worth pointing out that equation (3.44) applied to (3.37) yields \u22c60 d\u03c9 = 0, implying\nthat the angular momentum J, read off from the metric components as (see e.g. [41], ch. 19)\n\u03c9i = 2\u01ebijk J j\n\nxk\n+ O(1/r 3 ) for\nr3\n\nr \u2192 \u221e,\n\n(3.46)\n\nhas to vanish and so the metric is in fact static. This is a remarkable difference with respect\nto the supersymmetric case, where, instead, the one-form \u03c9 enclosing the off-diagonal\nelement of the metric is determined by solving equation [3]\n\u22c60 d\u03c9 = hdH, Hi .\n\n(3.47)\n\nAccording to equation (3.45), the \"tilded\" central charges Z\u0303 = Z(\u0393\u0303) and Z\u0303n = Z(\u0393\u0303n )\nhave to be aligned either parallel or antiparallel. These are conditions analogous to those\ndefining marginal or antimarginal stability in the BPS case. If we want to use the same\nterminology, this means that multicenter non-BPS systems described in this paper are\nmarginally (or antimarginally) stable and can decompose into their constituents everywhere in moduli space. In the supersymmetric sector such a decay is for generic charge\nconfigurations possible only on a particular surface of the scalar manifold (the wall of\nmarginal stability).\nThe relative positions of the sources in space are governed by the analogue of equation\n(7.23) in [3]:\nN\nX\n\u0002\n\u0003\nh\u0393\u0303m , \u0393\u0303n i\n= 2 Im e\u2212i\u03b1\u0303 Z(\u0393\u0303m ) \u03c4 =0 .\n(3.48)\n|xm \u2212 xn |\nn=1\n\nIn the supersymmetric sector one finds N \u2212 1 constraints, which may even determine a\nnontrivial topology of the solution space [42]. Here instead, since \u03b1\u0303 = \u03b1\u0303m (mod \u03c0) for all\nm implies Im[e\u2212i\u03b1\u0303 Z(\u0393\u0303m )] = 0 and then\nN\nX\nh\u0393\u0303m , \u0393\u0303n i\n= 0,\n|xm \u2212 xn |\nn=1\n\n(3.49)\n\nequation (3.48) gives:\nh\u0393\u0303m , \u0393\u0303n i = 0\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\u2200 m, n .\n\n(3.50)\n\n\fThis result in our context directly holds also for the charges \u0393n , stating that they have\nto be mutually local with respect to the product (2.9). Indeed, to satisfy the condition of\nconstancy of S, we chose to work with electric or magnetic configurations, which lead to\nmutually local electric or magnetic constituents. As a consequence, there are no constraints\non the positions and the centers are free.\n\n4. Non-BPS composites in the stu model\nIn this section we are going to apply the general procedure described above to the particular\ncase of the stu model, as a concrete example. In this extensively studied model (see eg. [43]\nand references therein), arising in type IIA compactification on a T 2 \u00d7 T 2 \u00d7 T 2 , the scalar\n\u0010\n\u00113\nmanifold is the homogeneous symmetric space SU(1,1)\nparameterized by the complex\nU(1)\n\nmoduli z 1 \u2261 s, z 2 \u2261 t and z 3 \u2261 u (corresponding to the complexified volumes of the tori).\nThe prepotential reads:\nf = stu .\n(4.1)\n\nThe Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a stu black hole with charge6 Ql = (pIl , qJl ) is\nrelated through\np\nAh\n= \u03c0 |I4 (Ql )|\nS=\n= \u03c0VBH\n(4.2)\n\u2202VBH =0\n4\nto the unique invariant I4 of the tri-fundamental representation (2, 2, 2) of the duality\ngroup (SL(2, Z))3 . Explicitly this invariant has the form:\nX\nI4 (Ql ) = \u2212(pIl qIl )2 + 4\npal qal pbl qbl \u2212 4p0l q1l q2l q3l + 4q0l p1l p2l p3l .\n(4.3)\na<b\n\nNon-BPS black holes with Z 6= 0 satisfy I4 (Ql ) < 0.\nOnce we have chosen to deal with an electric charge configuration,7 it follows that\nQ\u0303 = SQ = (\u2212p0 , 0, 0, qa ) = (\u2212p0l , 0, 0, \u2212qal ) and we can derive the non-BPS scalar solutions\nfor single-center and multicenter black holes using the equations of our formulation.\nIn the single-center case we have to use the harmonic function (written here as a\nsymplectic vector)\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\u2212p0l\np\u03030\n\uf8ec 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ecp\u0303a \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\nH\u0303 = \uf8ec \uf8f7 \u03c4 + h\u0303\u221e = \uf8ec\n(4.4)\n\uf8f7 \u03c4 + hl\u221e ,\n\uf8ed 0 \uf8f8\n\uf8ed q\u03030 \uf8f8\nq\u0303a\n\u2212qal\n\nwhere with h\u221e we have indicated the constant vector which at the end determines the\nvalue of the scalars at infinity. From (3.18), using \u03a32 (Q) = I4 (Ql ), we obtain the scalar\nsolutions:\nq\np\n0 l l l\n0\n\u2212i\nd\n\u2212i dH\u03031 4H\u0303 H\u03031 H\u03032 H\u03033\n\u2212i dH\u03031 \u03a3(H\u0303)\nH1l 4Hl H1 H2 H3\n(4.5)\n=\n=\nz a (\u03c4 ) =\nHl0\nH\u0303 0\nH\u0303 0\n6\n\nTo match conventions used in some stu literature, we have introduced the vector Ql , differing from Q\nby a sign reversal in the electric charges: qal = \u2212qa .\n7\nFor a more generic non-BPS charge configuration one can apply an SL(2, Z) duality transformation,\nsee e.g. [14].\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\fand then\nz 1 (\u03c4 ) = \u2212i\n\ns\n\nH2l H3l\n,\nHl0 H1l\n\nz 2 (\u03c4 ) = \u2212i\n\ns\n\nH1l H3l\n,\nHl0 H2l\n\nz 3 (\u03c4 ) = \u2212i\n\ns\n\nH1l H2l\n.\nHl0 H3l\n\n(4.6)\n\nThese expressions correctly reproduce the results known from the existing literature [24, 25].\nThe multicenter case is slightly more complicated. As we mentioned, a composite with\nN centers of charge Qn at positions xn has to satisfy the constraints (3.34) and (3.50).\nIn addition, at each xn , there has to exist a single-center black hole described in terms of\na harmonic function H\u0303(\u03c4 ) of the form (3.17). The charge cofiguration at each of the N\ncenters needs to be either electric or magnetic, as these are the only configurations that\nallow non-BPS attractors describable with our procedure. However, since for both these\nconfigurations the matrix S is diagonal, the constraints (3.34) are satisfied only if all Qn are\nof the same kind as Q. The composite is then constituted by N single-center black holes\nP\nwith charge Qn = (p0n , 0, 0, qan ) = (p0n l , 0, 0, \u2212qan l ) such that Q = n Qn . The positions of\nthe centers, as we discussed in subsection 3.2, are not constrained. The scalar solutions\nare as in (4.6) but with the harmonic function of the form:\nHl =\n\nX \u2212Qn l\n+ hl\u221e .\n|x\n\u2212\nx\n|\nn\nn\n\nHence, near the n-th center, z a reads:\ns\n|\u03b5abc |qbn l qcn l\nz a = \u2212i\n2p0n l qan l\n\nx \u2192 xn .\n\n(4.7)\n\n(4.8)\n\nThese expressions have the form conjectured in [25].\nWe close this section with a remark that our framework admits also the interpretation\n[15] of a non-supersymmetric stu black hole as comprised of supersymmetric constituents.\nThis model follows from the observation [14] that the ADM mass\ndU\n,\n\u03c4 \u21920 d\u03c4\n\nmADM = lim\n\n(4.9)\n\nof a non-BPS black hole can be written as the sum of the masses of four primitive BPS\ncenters. A direct computation in our setting (Re z = 0 \u21d2 B = 0) gives for a non-BPS\nblack hole of electric charge Ql = (p0l , 0, 0, qal ):\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(4.10)\nmnon-BPS = k p0l + q1l + q2l + q3l ,\n\nwith k a constant factor and p0l > 0. Computing instead the sum of the masses of four\nBPS black hole carrying a single type of charge we obtain:\n\u0010\n\u0011\nmBPS = k |p0l | + q1l + q2l + q3l .\n(4.11)\n\nNaively, one could try to construct a non-supersymmetric configuration with supersymmetric constituents by taking the matrices Sn to be proportional to the unit matrix.\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\fThis, however, would not satisfy the condition (3.35). A way to have supersymmetric centers is to relax the condition of existence of a regular black hole at each of the centers and\nto assign to each of them only one type of charge. The supersymmetry of such singular\nconfigurations will be unaffected by the matrices Sn , which we now need to choose equal\nto the matrix S: their effect will be reduced to multiplication by a constant factor.\n\n5. Conclusions\nIn this paper we extended Denef's formalism for multicenter black hole solutions in fourdimensional N = 2 supergravity on simple non-supersymmetric cases, using the fake superpotential method.\nOur generalization requires the superpotential to be related to the central charge in\na particular way (through a constant matrix S), which imposes some constraints on the\ncharge configuration. It turns out to be a limitation, since already some single-centered\ncases for which the superpotential is known to exist would violate this assumption (cf. [17]).\nTo satisfy it, we worked with electric or magnetic configurations, which lead to mutually\nlocal electric or magnetic constituents.\nStill, in the example of the stu model, for the single-centered case we recover the\nnon-supersymmetric black holes previously derived in a different way by Tripathy and\nTrivedi [24]. The multicenter non-supersymmetric stu solutions that we find, apart from\nthe constraints, correspond to the form conjectured by Kallosh, Sivanandam and Soroush\n[25]. Our approach allows also to resolve a single non-supersymmetric stu black hole into\na collection of supersymmetric centers in a way consistent with the BPS-constituent model\nof Gimon, Larsen and Sim\u00f3n [15].\nMore generally, the multicenter solutions that can be described by the method presented here are in a sense the simplest analogues of their supersymmetric counterparts,8\nyet exhibit different properties. In particular, similarly to non-supersymmetric solutions\nobtained by Gaiotto, Li and Padi [6] in the group-theoretical approach, but unlike in the\ngeneric supersymmetric case, the charges carried by the centers are mutually local and the\nangular momentum vanishes, rendering the solution static.\nThe following picture therefore seems to emerge, at least in the considered class of\ntheories: supersymmetric black holes can be split only into supersymmetric composites\nand only at particular loci of their moduli space, namely on the walls of marginal stability\n(except for a decomposition into constituents with aligned charge vectors, which is always\npossible). Non-supersymmetric black holes, on the contrary, can be resolved everywhere in\nmoduli space into a composite consisting of any number of non-supersymmetric centers at\narbitrary positions, but also (as Gimon, Larsen and Sim\u00f3n demonstrated for the stu model)\ninto a specific number of threshold-bound supersymmetric constituents (by combining the\ntwo descriptions, mixed cases would appear to be also possible).\nWe are aware, however, that the above summary is not complete. The results of\nBena et al. [12, 13] obtained in the Goldstein and Katmadas's almost-BPS framework [10]\n8\n\nFor instance, the Hessian of the black hole potential at its critical points is still proportional to the\nK\u00e4hler metric, implying stability and the absence of flat directions.\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\fdemonstrate that non-supersymmetric composites may also comprise constituents with\nconstrained positions. It would therefore be natural to see how the restriction of our\nmethod (specifically, the constancy of S) could be relaxed, and whether one would then\nobtain solutions with non-trivial angular momentum. Even more interesting, perhaps,\nwould be to clarify the relationship between the various approaches employed to construct\nnon-supersymmetric multicenter solutions (along the lines of [23], for instance, where the\nsuperpotential for single-center black holes was obtained through timelike dimensional reduction) and find out whether any of the techniques or their refinements could eventually\nexhaust all possible classes of extremal solutions. A further step could be then an attempt\nto use them for non-extremal composites [44].\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to Prof. Joan Sim\u00f3n for helpful discussions and remarks on a draft of\nthis paper, as well as to Prof. Antoine Van Proeyen and Bert Vercnocke for valuable\nconversations.
