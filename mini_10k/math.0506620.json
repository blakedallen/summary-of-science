We solve an extremal problem that arises in the study of the refractive indices\nof passive metamaterials. The problem concerns Hermitian functions in H 2 of the upper\nhalf-plane, i.e., H 2 functions satisfying f (\u2212x) = f (x). An additional requirement is that\nthe imaginary part of f be nonnegative for nonnegative arguments. We parameterize the\nclass of such functions whose real part is constant on an interval, and solve the problem\nof minimizing the imaginary part on the interval on which the function's real part takes\na given constant value.\n\n1. Introduction\nWe consider in this note an extremal problem that arose in investigations of certain\nelectromagnetic parameters of artificial materials (metamaterials). The physical interpretation of our solution in terms of bounds for refractive indices and theoretical limitations\nfor the design of metamaterials is described elsewhere [6]; the purpose of the present work\nis to give an account of the underlying mathematical problem, which seems to be of some\nindependent interest.\nWe will be dealing with Hardy spaces H p of the upper half-plane {z = x + iy : y > 0}.\nWe are primarily interested in H 2 , but it is convenient to have at our disposal the whole\nrange of spaces corresponding to 0 < p \u2264 \u221e. For 0 < p < \u221e, H p consists of those analytic\nfunctions f in the upper half-plane for which\nZ \u221e\np\nkf kp = sup\n|f (x + iy)|pdx < \u221e;\ny>0\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u221e\n\nH is the space of bounded analytic functions. A function f in H p has a nontangential\nboundary limit at almost every point of the real axis, and the corresponding limit function,\nalso denoted f , is in Lp = Lp (R). Indeed, the Lp norm of the boundary limit function\ncoincides with the H p norm introduced above. Thus we may view H p as a subspace of Lp .\nWe refer to [1] for these and other basic facts about H p , as well as the twin theory of H p\nof the unit disk. (We will make a reference to the disk setting at one point.)\nThe Hilbert space H 2 is the image of L2 (R+ ) under the Fourier transform. In practice,\nit is quite common that one considers functions in H 2 that are Fourier transforms of realvalued functions in L2 . This leads to the following symmetry condition: f (\u2212x) = f (x).\nFunctions f satisfying this condition will be referred to as Hermitian functions. Thus\nHermitian functions have even real parts and odd imaginary parts.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 30D55,44A15,45E05.\nThe first author is supported by the Research Council of Norway grant 160192/V30.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nKRISTIAN SEIP AND JOHANNES SKAAR\n\nThe Hilbert transform of a function u in Lp (1 \u2264 p < \u221e) is defined as\nZ\n1 \u221e u(t)\n\u0169(x) = p.v.\ndt.\n\u03c0 \u2212\u221e x \u2212 t\nIt acts boundedly on Lp for 1 < p < \u221e and isometrically on L2 . If u is a real-valued\nfunction in Lp for 1 < p < \u221e, then u + i\u0169 is in H p , and so the role of the Hilbert transform\nis to link the real and imaginary parts of functions in H p . We will only work with Hermitian\nfunctions, and we will be interested in computing real parts from imaginary parts. For this\nreason, it will be convenient for us to consider the following Hilbert operator:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n1 \u221e\n1\n1\nHv(x) = p.v.\ndt,\nv(t)\n+\n\u03c0 0\nt\u2212x t+x\nacting on functions in Lp (R+ ). Provided 1 < p < \u221e, the function Hv + iv will then be in\nH p , with the presumption that v is an odd function.\nA natural type of problem in H 2 is that of approximating a given Hermitian function\nsupported on two symmetric intervals. This means that one specifies a desired behavior\nin a certain frequency band and attempts to find, in some appropriate sense, an optimal\napproximation in H 2 . Without further restrictions, such a problem makes little sense,\nbecause it is easy to see that approximations can be made with arbitrary precision in\nL2 norm. It may be reasonable to prescribe bounds for the norm of the approximating\nfunction; see for instance the work of M. G. Kre\u0131\u0306n and P. Ya. Nudel'man [2], [3] for\ninteresting results along such lines. In the present note, we take a different route. We shall\nrequire the imaginary part of the function to be nonnegative for nonnegative arguments.1\nWe are interested in a specific problem of this general kind; it turns out to have an explicit\nand remarkably simple solution.\n2. Results\nWe turn to the statement of the problem. For a finite interval I = [a, b] (0 < a < b) and\nevery real number \u03b1 we define the family of functions\nK\u03b1 (I) = {v \u2208 L2 (R+ ) : v(t) \u2265 0 for t > 0, Hv(t) = \u03b1 for t \u2208 I}.\n(Here and elsewhere we suppress the obvious \"almost everywhere\" provisions needed when\nconsidering pointwise restrictions.) We think of functions in K\u03b1 (I), or more generally\nfunctions in L2 (R+ ), as the imaginary parts of Hermitian functions, and we view them\ntherefore as odd functions on R.\nOur purpose is to give a parametrization of K\u03b1 (I) and to solve the extremal problem\n\u03bb=\n1This\n\ninf\n\nv\u2208K\u22121 (I)\n\nk\u03c7I vk\u221e ,\n\nreflects the passivity condition for our electromagnetic medium.\n\n\fAN EXTREMAL PROBLEM RELATED TO NEGATIVE REFRACTION\n\n3\n\nwhere \u03c7I denotes the characteristic function of I. We will show that the extremal problem\nhas the following explicit solution:\n\u03bb=\n\nb2 \u2212 a2\n.\n2ab\n\nWe note that the quantity on the right is invariant under dilations sI = [sa, sb]. This is\nas it should be since v(t) is in K\u22121 (I) if and only if v(t/s) is in K\u22121 (sI) for s > 0. It will\nbecome clear that the extremal value \u03bb is not attained by any function in K\u22121 (I). We will\nalso see that the problem is insensitive to which Lp norm we choose to minimize.\nClearly, the corresponding extremal problem for K\u03b1 (I) has solution |\u03b1|\u03bb when \u03b1 < 0.\nHowever, if \u03b1 \u2265 0, the extremal problem is uninteresting and has solution 0. Thus the sign\nin the relation Hv(t) = \u03b1 for t \u2208 I matters in a decisive way.2\nThe following lemma is basic for our parametrization of K\u03b1 (I).\nLemma 1. A real-valued function in L2 (R+ \\ I) is the restriction to R+ \\ I of at most one\nreal-valued function v in L2 (R+ ) such that Hv(t) is constant on I.\nProof. We assume two real-valued functions v1 and v2 in L2 (R+ ) coincide off I and are such\nthat both u1 (t) = Hv1 (t) and u2(t) = Hv2 (t) are constant on I. If we set c = u2 (t) \u2212 u1 (t)\nfor t in I, then the function h = [(u1 \u2212 u2 + i(v1 \u2212 v2 ) + c]2 will be real for real arguments.\nA change of variables argument shows that then h(i(1 + z)/(1 \u2212 z)) belongs to H 1 of the\nunit disk. But a function in H 1 can be real only if it is a constant. Clearly, h can be a\nconstant only if u1 \u2212 u2 + i(v1 \u2212 v2 ) = 0.\n\u0004\nWe note that the assumption that v is in L2 is essential for this lemma; the proof would\nbreak down if we assumed, say, that v belonged to some Lp for p < 2.\nThe following function will play an essential role in what follows:\n\u03c3(z) = \u221a\n\nz2\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n\u221a\n\nb2\n\nz 2 \u2212 a2\n\n.\n\nThis function, which is taken to be positive for real arguments x > b, is analytic in the slit\nplane C \\ ([\u2212b, \u2212a] \u222a [a, b]). For real arguments a < |x| < b we define \u03c3(x) by extending it\ncontinuously from the upper half-plane. Thus \u03c3(x) takes values on the negative imaginary\nhalf-axis when x is in (a, b) and on the positive imaginary half-axis when \u2212x is in (a, b), and\notherwise it is real for real arguments. The key point, besides the symmetry \u03c3(\u2212x) = \u03c3(x),\nis that \u03c3 provides a means for switching between real and imaginary when switching off\nand on I.\nThe following is our main result.\n2The\n\ncase \u03b1 < \u22121 corresponds to the interesting physical phenomenon of negative refraction, which has\nreceived considerable attention in recent years. Artificial, negatively refracting materials, called metamaterials, have been realized in the microwave range [7], building on previous theoretical ideas [8, 5, 4]. As\nexplained in [6], the solution to our extremal problem provides a bound for the loss of negatively refracting\nmaterials when the real part of the refractive index is constant in a finite bandwidth.\n\n\f4\n\nKRISTIAN SEIP AND JOHANNES SKAAR\n\nTheorem. A nonnegative function v in L2 (R+ ) is in K\u03b1 (I) if and only if the following\nthree conditions hold:\nZ\n\n(1)\n\nR+ \\I\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nZ\n\nv(t)|\u03c3(t)|dt < \u221e\ntv(t)\u03c3(t)dt = \u03b1\n\nR+ \\I\n\nv(x) = H ((1 \u2212 \u03c7I )\u03c3v) (x)/|\u03c3(x)|,\n\nx \u2208 I.\n\nSome remarks are in order before we give the proof of the theorem.\nThe integrability condition (1) is merely a slight growth condition at the endpoints of I;\nwe may write it more succinctly as\nZ a\ndt\n[v(a \u2212 t) + v(b + t)] \u221a < \u221e.\nt\n0\nThis condition ensures that the integral in (2) and the Hilbert transform appearing in (3)\nare both well-defined.\nAt first sight, the theorem may not seem to give an explicit parametrization of K\u03b1 (I).\nHowever, the Hilbert transform appearing in (3) is given by\nZ\n2t\n1\nv(t)\u03c3(t) 2\ndt,\nH ((1 \u2212 \u03c7I )\u03c3v) (x) =\n\u03c0 R+ \\I\nt \u2212 x2\nand we observe that the integrand on the right is nonnegative whenever v(t) is nonnegative.\nHence v(x) \u2265 0 for x off I implies v(x) \u2265 0 for x in I. This small miracle implies that\nK\u03b1 (I) is parameterized by those nonnegative functions v in L2 (R+ \\ I) for which (1) and\n(2) hold and such that\nZ\n|H ((1 \u2212 \u03c7I )\u03c3v) (x)|2 |\u03c3(x)|\u22122 dx < \u221e.\nI\n\nBy rephrasing this condition in more explicit terms (see Lemma 3 below), we arrive at the\nfollowing corollary.\nCorollary. A nonnegative function \u03bd in L2 (R+ \\ I) has an extension to a function in some\nclass K\u03b1 (I) if and only if the following condition holds:\nZ aZ a\n| log(t + \u03c4 )|\n\u221a\ndtd\u03c4 < \u221e.\n[\u03bd(a \u2212 t)\u03bd(a \u2212 \u03c4 ) + \u03bd(b + t)\u03bd(b + \u03c4 )]\nt\u03c4\n0\n0\nThe difference between (1) and the condition above is the logarithmic factor, which\nmeans that the condition of the corollary is only a very slight strengthening of (1). It is\nclear that for instance boundedness of v near the endpoints of I is more than enough.\n\n\fAN EXTREMAL PROBLEM RELATED TO NEGATIVE REFRACTION\n\n5\n\nWe note that the integrand in (2) is negative to the left of I and positive to the right of\nI. This means that if \u03b1 is negative, then\nZ\n2 a\ntv(t)|\u03c3(t)|dt,\n|\u03b1| \u2264\n\u03c0 0\nwith equality holding if v vanishes to the right of I. It follows that\nZ\n1 a\n2t\n|\u03b1|\nH ((1 \u2212 \u03c7I )\u03c3v) (x) \u2265\nv(t)\u03c3(t) 2\ndt\n\u2265\n;\n\u03c0 0\nt \u2212 x2\nx2\nwe may come as close as we wish to this lower bound by choosing any suitable v supported\non a small set sufficiently close to 0. Hence our extremal problem (corresponding to\n\u03b1 = \u22121) has solution\np\n(b2 \u2212 x2 )(x2 \u2212 a2 )\nb2 \u2212 a2\n\u03bb = max\n=\n,\nx\u2208I\nx2\n2ab\nas proclaimed above. We also observe that the same function 1/(x2 |\u03c3(x)|) would give the\ninfimum for the Lp norm over I for any other value of p > 0.\nIf, on the other hand, \u03b1 is positive, we have instead\nZ\n2 \u221e\n\u03b1\u2264\ntv(t)|\u03c3(t)|dt,\n\u03c0 b\nwith equality holding if v vanishes to the left of I. In this case, arguing in the same fashion\nas above, we find that we can get H ((1 \u2212 \u03c7I )\u03c3v) (x) as small as we please by letting v be\nsupported on a set sufficiently far to the right of I.\n3. Proofs\nWe now turn to the proof of the theorem and its corollary. We will rely on Lemma 1\nand two additional lemmas.\nLemma 2. For every t in (0, a) \u222a (b, \u221e) the function\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2t\n\u03c3(t)\nft (x) = 2\n\u2212 2t\u03c3(t)\n1\u2212\nt \u2212 x2\n\u03c3(x)\nis in H p for p > 1/2, and the following estimates hold\nkft k1 \u2264 p\n\u221e\n\nC1\n|(a \u2212 t)(b \u2212 t)|\n\n, t < 2b,\n\nC2\n,\n|x| + 1\n2b\nwhere the constants C1 and C2 only depend on a and b.\nZ\n\n|ft (x)|2 dt \u2264\n\nProof. It is immediate that ft belongs to H p for p > 1/2 because the isolated singularities\n\u00b1t are removable and ft (z) = O(z \u22122 ) when z \u2192 \u221e. The norm estimates follow from\nelementary calculations.\n\u0004\n\n\f6\n\nKRISTIAN SEIP AND JOHANNES SKAAR\n\nLemma 3. A nonnegative function \u03bd in L2 (R+ \\ I) satisfies\nZ\n|H((1 \u2212 \u03c7I )\u03c3\u03bd)(x)|2 |\u03c3(x)|\u22122 dx < \u221e\nI\n\nif and only if the following condition holds:\nZ aZ a\n| log(t + \u03c4 )|\n\u221a\n[\u03bd(a \u2212 t)\u03bd(a \u2212 \u03c4 ) + \u03bd(b + t)\u03bd(b + \u03c4 )]\ndtd\u03c4 < \u221e.\nt\u03c4\n0\n0\nProof. The necessary and sufficient condition for square-integrability at the left end-point\nof I is that\n\u00132\nZ a \u0012Z a\n\u03bd(a \u2212 t)\n\u221a\ndt x dx < \u221e.\nt(t + x)\n0\n0\nBy Fubini's theorem, we may interchange the order of integration so that this condition\nbecomes\nZ aZ a\n| log(t + \u03c4 )|\n\u221a\n\u03bd(a \u2212 t)\u03bd(a \u2212 \u03c4 )\ndtd\u03c4 < \u221e.\nt\u03c4\n0\n0\nCombining this with the corresponding condition at the right end-point of I, we arrive at\nthe condition of the lemma.\n\u0004\nThe theorem is now proved in the following way. We assume first that we are given a\nnonnegative function v in L2 (R+ ) satisfying (1), (2), and (3). We claim that the function\nZ\n1\nv(t)ft (x)dt\nf1 (x) =\n\u03c0 (0,a)\u222a(b,2b)\nis in H 1 . Indeed, by Lemma 2 and Fubini's theorem,\nZ\nC1\nv(t)\np\nkf1 k1 \u2264\ndt,\n\u03c0 (0,a)\u222a(b,2b) |(a \u2212 t)(b \u2212 t)|\n\nand the integral on the right is bounded thanks to (1). On the other hand,\nZ\n1 \u221e\nv(t)ft (x)dt\nf2 (x) =\n\u03c0 2b\nis in H p for p > 2, because by the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality and Lemma 2 we have\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\np/2\nC2\n1\np\np\n|f2 (x)| dx \u2264 p kvk2\ndx.\np/2\n\u03c0\n\u2212\u221e\n\u2212\u221e (|x| + 1)\nThe imaginary part of f1 + f2 is supported by I and equals \u2212v there, in view of (3). Since\nv is assumed to be in L2 , it follows that f1 + f2 is in fact in H 2 .\nWe set f = H((1 \u2212 \u03c7I )v) + i(1 \u2212 \u03c7I )v, which is a function in H 2 . We observe that the\nimaginary part of f \u2212 (f1 + f2 ) equals v and that its real part equals \u03b1 on I, when taking\ninto account (2). So we have proved that the given v is indeed in K\u03b1 (I).\nWe now prove the necessity of the three conditions of the theorem. So assume we\nare given a nonnegative function v in L2 (R+ ) belonging to some class K\u03b1 (I). Setting\n\n\fAN EXTREMAL PROBLEM RELATED TO NEGATIVE REFRACTION\n\n7\n\nI\u03b5 = [a + \u03b5, b \u2212 \u03b5], we see that v also belongs to K\u03b1 (I\u03b5 ) whenever 0 < \u03b5 < (b \u2212 a)/2. But\nsince the Hilbert transform of v is constant near the endpoints of I\u03b5 , it follows that\nZ\nv(t)|\u03c3\u03b5 (t)|dt < \u221e,\nR+ \\I\u03b5\n\nwhere now\n\u03c3\u03b5 (t) = p\n\nWe claim that this means that\n(4)\n\nt2\n\n\u2212 (b \u2212\n\n1\np\n\n\u03b5)2\n\nt2 \u2212 (a + \u03b5)2\n\n.\n\nv(x) = H ((1 \u2212 \u03c7I\u03b5 )\u03c3\u03b5 v) (x)/|\u03c3\u03b5 (x)|,\n\nprovided x is in (a + \u03b5, b \u2212 \u03b5). Indeed, by Lemma 1, it is enough to verify that\n(1 \u2212 \u03c7I\u03b5 (x))v(x) + \u03c7I\u03b5 (x)H ((1 \u2212 \u03c7I\u03b5 )\u03c3\u03b5 v) (x)/|\u03c3\u03b5 (x)|\n\nis in K\u03b1 (I\u03b5 ) for some \u03b1. Since, in view of Lemma 3, the function on the right-hand side of\n(4) is square-integrable on I\u03b5 , the claim follows by repeating the argument in the first part\nof the proof.\nWe may view H ((1 \u2212 \u03c7I\u03b5 )\u03c3\u03b5 v) (x) as the L1 norm of the function\n1\n2t\nhx,\u03b5 (t) = ((1 \u2212 \u03c7I\u03b5 (t))\u03c3\u03b5 (t)v(t)) 2\n.\n\u03c0\nt \u2212 x2\nThen (4) says that khx,\u03b5 k1 \u2192 v(x)|\u03c3(x)| when \u03b5 \u2192 0. Since we also have that\n1\n2t\nhx,\u03b5 (t) \u2192 ((1 \u2212 \u03c7I (t))\u03c3(t)v(t)) 2\n\u03c0\nt \u2212 x2\nfor every t, we obtain\nv(x) = H ((1 \u2212 \u03c7I )\u03c3v) (x)/|\u03c3(x)|\nfor every x in (a, b). By a similar argument, we find that\nZ\nZ\n2\n2\ntv(t)\u03c3\u03b5 (t)dt =\ntv(t)\u03c3(t)dt.\n\u03b1 = lim\n\u03b5\u21920 \u03c0 R+ \\I\n\u03c0 R+ \\I\n\u03b5\nThe necessity of (1) has already been observed; without it we would reach the contradictory\nconclusion that v(x) = \u221e for almost every x \u2208 (a, b).\nWe finally note that the corollary is an immediate consequence of the theorem and\nlemmas 1 and 3.\nReferences\n[1] J.
