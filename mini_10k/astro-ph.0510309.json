Here we update these studies, and we extend\nour research to events observed with KONUS satellite which gives a new insight\ninto the spectra not possible with the BATSE data. KONUS has observed 18\nevents with T90 \u2264 100 ms duration. These events display considerable numbers\nof photons with energies above 1 MeV and have photons above 5 MeV in all\ncases. These appear to be some of the most energetic photons observed from any\nclasses of GRB to date.\nSubject headings: gamma rays: bursts\n\n1.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Long Bursts (T90 > 2 s) are known to originate at cosmological distances with\nmany identified counterparts and they are widely believed to be related to the collapse of\nmassive stars (van Paradijs et al. 1997; Metzger et al. 1997; Fishman 1994). Considerable\ninformation about the short bursts can be found (Ghirlanda et al. 2004; Nakar and Piran\n2002; Magliocchetti et al. 2003; Frederiks et al. 2003; Ramirez-Ruiz and Fenimore 2000)\nincluding the very interesting possibility that the long and short bursts come from the same\nsources (Ghirlanda et al. 2004). SWIFT results seem to indicate the merger scenario (Berger\net al. 2005) but further study of short bursts is necessary. In this letter we discuss the\nproperties of the Very Short Bursts (T90 \u2264 100 ms; hereafter VSB). We have found some\nunusual aspects of these events including:\na) Very hard photon spectra compared to longer duration GRBs.\n1\n\nUniversity of California Los Angeles, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Box 951447, Los Angeles,\nCA 90095-1547, USA; e-mail: stanislaw.otwinowski@cern.ch\n2\n\nNicolaus Copernicus Astronomical Center, Bartycka 18, 00-716 Warsaw, Poland\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nb) A significant angular asymmetry on the Galactic Plane.\nc) A < V /Vmax > value consistent with 1/2.\nIn this paper we update the results of Cline et al. (1999, 2001, 2003) including new\nevents. We also analyze the VSB observed with the KONUS detector that have been recently\nreported (KONUS catalog, Mazets at al. 2002). Sensitivity of KONUS detector above 1 MeV\nallows to draw firm conclusions on the hard part of the VSB spectra. Data analysis is given\nin Section 2 (BATSE results) and Section 3 (KONUS results), and the results are discussed\nin Section 4.\n\n2.\n\nFURTHER STUDY OF THE BATSE DATA\n\nWe use the data from the BATSE Current Gamma-Ray Burst Catalog (BATSE Catalog\n2003). It contains the following data base: Basic (2702 events - last update Sep. 9, 2000),\nDuration (2041 events - last update Aug.17, 2000), CMAX/CMIN (1318 events - last update\nAug. 1, 2003). The subsample of Short Bursts (hereafter SB), with 0.1 s \u2264 T90 < 2 s , consists\nof 448 bursts. There are 51 bursts that have T90 \u2264 0.1 s, and they form our subsample of\nVSB. We note that there has been evidence for an anisotropy in the SB from a previous\nstudy (Magliocchetti et al. 2003).\n\n2.1.\n\nAnisotropic distribution of the VSB\n\nThe angular distribution of VSB and SB in Galactic Coordinates is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe sky was divided into 8 equal regions. In the case of isotropic distribution the number\nof bursts in each region should be described by the Poisson distribution. The histograms of\nsuch values are shown in Fig. 1. The probability of any number of bursts in a single zone\nmultiplied by the number of zones (8) is shown with full circles. For 448 SB (0.1 s \u2264 T90 < 2\ns) we see conformity with isotropic distribution, but for VSB (T90 \u2264 0.1 s) the observed\ndistribution is strongly improbable for isotropic distribution. The number of bursts in one of\nthe regions (roughly in the direction of the Galactic Anticenter) is 20, which is much higher\nthan the expected average of 51/8. The probability to find twenty or more events (from the\ntotal number of fifty one) in the region of 1/8 area is 0.00007. This result argues for other\nexplanation than the statistical fluctuation. Background in the direction of the Galactic\nCenter is 12500 \u00b1 1000 cts s\u22121 , while the mean level of the background outside the region is\n13800 \u00b1 1300 cts s\u22121 , and the total number of SB in this regions is slightly lower than the\nexpected average (but within the expected error). Therefore, background anisotropy cannot\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nbe responsible for the observed distribution of the VSB across the sky.\nWe support the choice of T90 = 0.1 s to discriminate VSB from SB with the following\nconsideration. In Fig.2 we show the distribution of the excess number of the GRBs as a function of T90 . The excess from the isotropic distribution is calculated as a difference between\nthe GRBs number in the chosen region and the sum of all GRBs number in other regions\ndivided by seven. This study shows that the incompatibility with isotropic distribution is\nseen only for GRBs with T90 \u2264 0.1 s. We observe the total excess of 15.71 \u00b1 4.52 bursts in\nthis region.\n\n2.2.\n\n< V /Vmax > test of radial distribution\n\nWe have also reanalyzed the overall radial distribution of the VSB and the SB using\nthe standard < V /Vmax > test (Schmidt et al. 1988). We use the CMAX/CMIN table\nfrom BATSE catalog as an input for V /Vmax calculations: V /Vmax = (C/Cmin )\u22123/2 and we\nfollow the standard algorithm given in BATSE Catalog (2003). Eight events in the table\nCMAX/CMIN have all values lower than the accepted trigger. We can either reject these\nevents, or attribute them the value close to the detection threshold (V /Vmax \u2248 0.9). The\nchoice does not affect significantly the measured value of V /Vmax (see Table 1).\nThe result of V /Vmax distributions and mean values are presented in Fig. 3. SB appear\nto come from cosmological distances given the V /Vmax distribution we see since this is similar\nto the distribution for the Long GRBs. No cosmological effects are seen in the distribution\nof VSB.\n\n3.\n\nSTUDY OF THE VSB FROM THE KONUS SAMPLE\n\nIn Table 2 are listed the candidates for VSB from KONUS - 18 events! This is approximately what would be expected from the relative KONUS and BATSE exposure and\nconfirms that the BATSE events are real. In the case, when the same event (the same time\nof registration) was observed in both KONUS and BATSE experiments both T90 values are\nshown in Table 2 (KONUS catalog, Mazets at al. 2002). Independent detections by satellites\nother than KONUS are also marked, including the trigger number (B-BATSE, U-Ulysses, NNEAR). We accept as VSB events where no other significant maximum (above background)\nappears within 30 seconds after the trigger.\nThe KONUS detector has a significantly larger energy acceptance out to tens of MeV.\nThe BATSE detector has a smaller NaI absorber and is not sensitive to 1-10 MeV photons.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nTherefore the KONUS detector offers the first chance to measure higher energy photons from\nVSB. However, there are no corresponding coordinates for the KONUS events as in the case\nof BATSE. We therefore use the KONUS data mainly for spectral information.\nAll VSB show appreciable number of photons above 1 MeV energy. This follows the\ntrend observed in the BATSE data that the VSB events have a hard energy spectrum. All\nevents also show gamma rays above 5 MeV. In Fig.4 we compare the mean energy of SB\nand VSB for KONUS events. We observe that in the MeV region the spectra of VSB are\nsignificantly harder than the spectra of SB. The spectra start to be flatter above 3 MeV and\nthe effect in the case of VSB is again stronger.\n\n4.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThis extended analysis of the BATSE data and the results of the KONUS detector\ncontinue to suggest that the VSB events form a separate class of events from the SB. Strong\nanisotropy and < V /Vmax >= 0.5 consistent with Euclidean space strongly argue for the\nlocal origin of this phenomenon. Spectra of VSB are very hard, supporting the claim that a\ndifferent mechanism is here at work.\nDetected counterparts of Long Bursts at other wavelengths established the relation of\nthose events to the massive star collapse; no such support was available for SBs (Zhang and\nMeszaros 2004). Therefore, several possibilities for the origin of this class of bursts were\nproposed, e.g. Cline et al. (2003). This includes neutron star mergers (Goodman et al. 1987;\nDar 1999) and neutron star collapse to strange-quark stars (Dar 1999). There were also\nsuggestions that the nature of Long and Short Bursts is the same (Yamazaki et al. 2004)\nalthough SB are on average harder (Kouveliotou et al. 1993; Ghirlanda et al. 2004), have\n< V /Vmax > closer to 1 and show traces of anisotropy Magliocchetti et al. (2003). VSBs are\nextreme examples being still harder and showing even more spectacular anisotropy, clearly\nindicating towards the local origin of this class of events.\nPrimordial black hole evaporation, as an explanation of the existence of the VSB class,\nis also possible (for details, see Cline (2000)). The energy expected from such phenomenon\nis of order of M\u2217 c2 , and the currently evaporating black holes have masses M\u2217 \u223c 1015 g\n(Carr 2003; Beckenstein 2004). Such energy, if converted with an efficiency f\u03b3 into the\nform of \u03b3-rays collimated in a solid angle \u03a9, would give the observed fluence F = 8 \u00d7\n10\u22129 f\u03b3 ( 10M15\u2217g )( 1kpc\n)2 ( 4\u03c0\n) [erg cm\u22122 ]. The weakest VSB (see Table 2) can come from distances\nD\n\u03a9\nof \u223c 300 pc if uncollimated, and from further out if some collimation is involved. However,\nless standard approach to primordial black hole mass evaporation gives much broader range\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nof numbers (Sendouda et al. 2005).\nWe also note that there is some confusion between the Short GRB and the SGR super\nflares (Hurley et al. 2005). However, the very hard spectrum of the VSB would seem to\nseparate those types of events.\nPlausible detection of X-ray afterglows (Frederiks et al. 2003), and recent claims of the\nidentification of a host galaxy for two SB Swift bursts (Bloom et al. 2005; Berger et al.\n2005) might point toward merger scenario. One of the localized bursts (GRB 050724) is a\ntypical SB (T90 \u223c 0.26 s). The other one (GRB 050509b) is intermediate between a VSB and\na SB. Its Galactic Coordinate is not in the excess region of Fig 1a and the limited energy\nacceptance of Swift does not allow a test of the presence of MeV photons to compare with\nother VSB studied here. More SWIFT data may clear the issue.\n\n5.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have provided a new analysis of the most recent VSB events from\nBATSE. We have also studied the VSB from KONUS for the first time. We show that the\nGRBs with time duration below 100 ms appear to form a separate class of GRBs. The\nKONUS data show that these events have a very hard photon spectrum up to 10 MeV this effect was already hinted in the BATSE hardness data. The events appear to originate\nnearby within the Galaxy as the asymmetry plot (Fig. 1.a) and the V /Vmax distribution\n(Fig. 2.a) indicate. This effect is statistically significant. In previous studies of this subject,\nwe have suggested that such events could come from Primordial Black Hole evaporation\n(Cline et al. 2003), with supplementary details in Cline (2000). The other local sources such\nas neutron stars should also be candidates.\nAcknowledgments. This work was supported in part by grants 2P03D00322 and PBZKBN-054/P03/2001.
