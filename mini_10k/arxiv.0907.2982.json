Introduction\n\nPerformances of several single gap (2 mm) prototype Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) [1] made of high resistive\n(\u03c1 \u223c 1010 - 1012 \u03a9 cm) bakelite paper laminates produced\nand commercially available in India has been carried out in\nrecent times [2]. A thin silicone coating has been applied\nto the inner electrode faces of the detectors to make the\nsurfaces smooth. Such high resistive electrodes are being\nexplored since the detectors are one of the candidates of\nthe proposed neutrino oscillation experiment in the Indiabased Neutrino Observatory (INO) [3]. One of the requirements for the INO RPC is to have a time resolution \u223c 2 ns\nor better.\nThe silicone coated chambers, operated in the streamer\nmode using argon, tetrafluroethane (R-134a) and isobutane\nin 34:59:7 mixing ratio, prepared by a gas mixing and flow\ncontrol unit [4] have been tested with cosmic rays. The results of the long term test (with efficiency > 90%, counting rate of \u223c 0.1 Hz/cm2 ) and some other aspects such\nas crosstalk, dependence on threshold value, the effect of\nexternal humidity etc. of these silicone coated RPCs have\nbeen reported earlier [2,5]. In this article, we would like to\npresent the timing characteristics of such single gap (2 mm)\nsilicone coated RPCs.\n\n\u2217\nEmail address: saikatb@veccal.ernet.in (S.

Test setup and method of calculation\nThe time resolution of the RPC was measured in the\nsame cosmic ray test bench described in Ref. [2]. The cosmic ray telescope was constructed using three scintillators,\ntwo placed above the RPC and one below. The individual\ntime resolution of each RPC was estimated as follows. The\ntriple coincidence of the signals obtained from the three\nscintillators was taken as the START signal (master trigger) for the TDC. The STOP signal was taken from a single\nRPC strip. Fig. 1 shows the schematic of the time resolution measurement setup.\nThe distribution of the time difference between the master trigger and the signal from one RPC strip is shown in\nFig. 2. Time calibration was measured as 0.1 ns/channel.\nFrom the time difference spectrum, the full width at half\nmaximum (FWHM) and the corresponding standard deviation (\u03c3 ij ), where i and j refer to scintillators and the\n\n\f6\n\n55\n\n5\nFWHM (ns)\n\n600\nCounts\n\n60\n\n400\n200\n\naverage arrival time (ns)\n\n4\n\n50\n45\n\n3\n40\n2\n\n35\n\naverage arrival time (ns)\n\n800\n\nFWHM (ns)\n\n0\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n55\n60\n65\nTime difference (ns)\n\n1\n\n70\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nTime (day)\n\nFig. 2.

The time resolution (FWHM) and the average signal arrival\ntime with respect to the master trigger as a function of HV for two\nsilicone coated RPC.\n\nRPC, were obtained by fitting a Gaussian function. The\nsame \u03c3 ij were obtained similarly for the 3 different pairs of\nthe scintillators I, II and III. The intrinsic time resolutions\nof the RPC and the scintillators were obtained from the individual standard deviations \u03c3 i , \u03c3 j , which were extracted\nby solving the equations: \u03c3 ij 2 = \u03c3 i 2 +\u03c3 j 2 [6]. Time resolution (FWHM) of the individual scintillators were obtained\nas: 3.20 \u00b1 0.07 ns (scintillator I), 3.39 \u00b1 0.08 ns (scintillator II) and 1.98 \u00b1 0.02 ns (scintillator III), where the\nquoted uncertainties include statistical and fitting errors.\nThe extracted time resolution (FWHM) of the RPC at 8\nkV operating voltage for a typical run was: 2.48 \u00b1 0.08 ns.\n3.

The time resolution (FWHM) and the average signal arrival\ntime of one RPC with respect to another RPC as a function of HV.\n\nage (HV) for the two 30 cm \u00d7 30 cm RPCs are shown in\nFig. 3. The measured values of T include the delays introduced in both the START and STOP channels by the electronics shown in Fig. 1. The time resolution for both the\nmodules improves and the average signal arrival time decreases with the increase of HV which is common to any gas\nfilled detector. At the plateau region, the time resolution\nhas been found to be \u223c 2 ns.\nOne of the modules was tested for a long period (more\nthan 130 days) at a constant high voltage of 8 kV and\nshowed nearly constant values of the time resolution (\u223c 2-3\nns) and the average signal arrival time (\u223c 55 ns) as shown\nin Fig. 4.\nFinally the time resolution between two RPCs was measured by taking the START signal from one RPC operated\nat constant voltage (8 kV), while the voltage of the other\nRPC was varied. The results are shown in Fig. 5. In this\ncase, the average time resolution is found to be \u223c 3 ns in\nthe plateau region.\n\n\f4. Conclusions and outlook\nIn conclusion, a systematic study on the timing properties of silicone coated RPCs made of bakelite paper laminates, commercially available in India has been performed.\nThe measured time resolution of those RPCs have been\nfound to be \u223c 2 ns which is comparable to any single gap\nglass or linseed oil coated bakelite RPC. The study of the\neffect of continuous HV on the time resolution has also been\nperformed. In the long term operation of the detector, 2-3\nns time resolution is obtained.\n5.
