Taking into account Stark shifts in the calculation of\nsynthetic spectra we reduced the scatter in individual line radial velocity measurements\nfrom \u223c 3 to . 1 km s\u22121 . We present revised abundances of O, Mg, Si, Ca, and Fe\nbased on a critical review of line broadening parameters and oscillator strengths. The\nnew measurements are generally in agreement with our previous analysis with the\nexception of magnesium with a revised abundance a factor of two lower than previously\nestimated. The magnesium, silicon and iron abundances exceed solar abundances, but\nthe oxygen and calcium abundances are below solar. Also, we compared the observed\nline profiles to synthetic spectra computed with variable accretion rates and vertical\nabundance distributions assuming diffusive steady-state. The inferred accretion rates\nvary from \u1e40 = 2 \u00d7 106 for calcium to 2 \u00d7 109 g s\u22121 for oxygen. We find that the\naccretion flow must be oxygen-rich while being deficient in calcium relative to solar\nabundances. The lack of radial velocity variations between two measurement epochs\nsuggests that GALEX J1931+0117 is probably not in a close binary and that the\nsource of the accreted material resides in a debris disc.\nKey words: stars: abundance \u2013 stars: individual: GALEX J193156.8+011745 \u2013 white\ndwarfs\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nGALEX J193156.8+011745 (GALEX J1931+0117, thereafter) is a hydrogen-rich white dwarf discovered by\nVennes, Kawka, & N\u00e9meth (2010a) and characterized by an\nopulent heavy-element line spectrum and an infrared excess. The original low-resolution spectrum obtained with\nthe New Technology Telescope (NTT) at La Silla Observatory showed a strong Mg ii\u03bb4481 doublet and weaker silicon\nlines. Follow-up echelle spectroscopy obtained with the Very\nLarge Telescope (VLT)-Kueyen enabled a detailed abundance study. The near-solar abundances of oxygen, magnesium, silicon, calcium and iron bear the signature of an external supply of material accreting onto the surface of the white\ndwarf. Based on available data, Vennes et al. concluded that\n\n\u22c6\n\nBased on observations made with ESO telescopes at the La\nSilla Paranal Observatory under programme 283.D-5060.\n\u2020 E-mail: vennes@sunstel.asu.cas.cz (SV); kawka@sunstel.asu.\ncas.cz (AK); nemeth@sunstel.asu.cas.cz (NM)\nc 2010 RAS\n\nthe supply may originate from a close, sub-stellar companion\nor from a cool debris disc.\nThe presence of heavy elements in hydrogen-rich\nwhite dwarfs has variously been interpreted as intrinsic to the white dwarf, or as extrinsic, i.e., supplied\nby the interstellar medium (Dupuis, Fontaine, & Wesemael\n1993), by a nearby companion as in post-common envelope systems (Debes 2006; Kawka et al. 2008), or by\na debris disc (Zuckerman et al. 2003; Kilic et al. 2006;\nFarihi, Zuckerman, & Becklin 2008). However, accretion\nfrom the interstellar medium is unlikely because of supply shortages (Farihi et al. 2010a). In the extrinsic scenarios, the elements are accreted and diffused in the atmosphere and envelope of the star (see Fontaine & Michaud\n1979; Koester 2009). An intrinsic, or internal, reservoir of\nheavy elements is also possible, but in either scenario a\nself-consistent solution of the diffusion equation must explore the effect of radiative acceleration on trace elements\n(Chayer, Fontaine, & Wesemael 1995; Chayer et al. 1995).\nAs a class, the polluted DA white dwarfs, or DAZs,\n\n\f2\n\nS. Vennes et al.\n\nare often defined by the detection of the Ca ii H&K doublet in optical spectra of cooler objects (Zuckerman et al.\n2003; Koester et al. 2005), or by the detection of carbon and silicon in the ultraviolet spectra of warmer objects (Dupuis et al. 2009a,b). Exceptionally, Mg ii\u03bb4481\nis, so far, only detected in a handful of warm white\ndwarfs such as EG 102 (Holberg, Barstow, & Green 1997),\nGALEX J1931+0117, and two warm white dwarfs from\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) that show evidence of dusty and gaseous discs (G\u00e4nsicke et al. 2006;\nG\u00e4nsicke, Marsh, & Southworth 2007). The presence of a\nlarge concentration of magnesium in the last two objects\nhelped establish a strong link between heavy element pollution and dense circumstellar environments. Moreover, an\ninfrared excess that cannot otherwise be explained by a cool\ncompanion, may be attributed to a dust ring as in the case\nof the white dwarf G29-38 (Graham et al. 1990).\nWe present new high-dispersion spectroscopic observations that help elucidate the nature of the peculiar abundance pattern in GALEX J1931+0117 in support of the\ndebris disc model. Our observations are presented in Section 2, and a detailed line profile and abundance analysis is\npresented in Section 3. In Section 3.1 we compile and evaluate line broadening parameters and oscillator strengths. In\nSection 3.2 we describe steady-state diffusion models and\npredicted abundance gradients in the stable atmospheres of\nhot white dwarfs. In Section 3.3 we present revised abundances based on a review of atomic data, we assess non-local\nthermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) effects on measured\nabundances, and we constrain the accretion rates on the atmosphere of GALEX J1931+0117. Finally, we conclude in\nSection 4.\n\nTable 1. Additional UVES line identifications.\n\nOBSERVATIONS\n\nFollowing the identification of GALEX J1931+0117 as a\nDAZ white dwarf we obtained a series of echelle spectra\nusing standard settings with the UV-Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) attached to the VLT-Kueyen. All spectra were obtained with the slit width set at 1\u2032\u2032 , offering\na resolving power R \u2248 46000. The exposure times were\n1450 s. The first series of spectra were obtained on UT 2009\nNov 12 (epoch 1, thereafter) with the dichroic #2 and the\n\"HER 5\" and \"BK7 5\" filters on the blue and red arms, respectively. The blue spectrum was centred at 4370\u00c5 and\ncovered the range 3757-4985\u00c5, and the red spectra were\ncentred at 7600\u00c5 and covered the ranges 5698-7532 and\n7660-9464\u00c5. The first series of spectra were analysed by\nus (Vennes, Kawka, & N\u00e9meth 2010a). The second series of\nspectra were obtained on UT 2010 Mar 15 (epoch 2, thereafter) with the dichroic #1 and the \"HER 5\" and \"SHP700\"\nfilters on the blue and red arms, respectively. The blue spectrum was centred at 3900\u00c5 and covered the range 32904518\u00c5, and the red spectra were centred at 5800\u00c5 and covered the ranges 4788-5750 and 5839-6808\u00c5.\nWe remeasured the H\u03b1 radial velocity by fitting Gaussian profiles to the well-exposed, narrow line cores obtained\nat epochs 1 and 2, vH\u03b1,1 = 37.6 \u00b1 0.8 km s\u22121 and vH\u03b1,2 =\n36.8 \u00b1 1.0 km s\u22121 , respectively.

A set of nine\nFe ii lines were observed allowing us to improve our earlier iron abundance measurement. Two strong Si ii lines are\nadded to our list, but their line velocities deviate significantly from the rest velocity, set by H\u03b1, by 6 and 7 km s\u22121 .\nA closer examination of other Si ii lines observed at epoch\n1 also reveals similar radial velocity shifts that shall be investigated in Section 3.3.1. The sulfur lines S ii\u03bb5014.069,\n\u03bb5032.447, and \u03bb5432.815\u00c5 were not detected.\n\n3\n2\n\nIon\n\nANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION\n\nWe adopted the model atmosphere analysis of\nVennes, Kawka, & N\u00e9meth (2010a) that was based\non non-LTE calculations made with tlusty-synspec\n(Hubeny & Lanz 1995; Lanz & Hubeny 1995). All models\nwere computed at Teff = 20890 K and log g = 7.90.\nVennes, Kawka, & N\u00e9meth (2010a) found the difference\nbetween the best-fitting (Teff , log g) to the Balmer line\nseries using non-LTE heavy-element blanketed model atmospheres and the best-fitting solution using pure-hydrogen\nLTE models to be within statistical errors (\u2206Teff = +120\nK, \u2206 log g = \u2212.04). Heavy elements contribute less than\n0.1% of the total electron density and their combined\nopacities are relatively modest in this range of effective\ntemperatures compared to the strong Lyman and Balmer\nlines and continua.\nThe model atmosphere structures and synthetic spectra employed in the line profile analysis were computed assuming non-LTE, and with varying abundances of oxygen,\nmagnesium, silicon, calcium and iron. The spectral syntheses are computed with different atomic data sets described\nbelow (Section 3.1). Also, we computed spectral syntheses\nwith depth-dependent trace element abundances that were\nprescribed by diffusion theory (Section 3.2).

The red Mg ii\u03bb7989 multiplet\nshows evidence of Stark shifts (Vennes, Kawka, & N\u00e9meth\n2010a) although the spectrum is particularly noisy in the\nvicinity of the multiplet. On the other hand, the strong\nMg ii\u03bb4481 doublet is well exposed. Because of its strength,\nthe line profile is particularly sensitive to broadening parameters, although quoted oscillator strength values are consistent (NIST and Kurucz & Bell 1995) within . 2%.\nThe compilation of Kurucz & Bell (1995) does not provide a Stark width for the Mg ii\u03bb4481 doublet which is then\nestimated in synspec using the formula (Castelli 2005)\n\u0393 = 10\u22128 n5eff ,\n\n(2)\n\u22121\n\n\u22123\n\nwhere \u0393 is expressed in rad s cm and neff is the effective\nquantum number in the hydrogenic approximation\nn2eff = (Z + 1)2\n\n13.595\n,\nEi\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Ei is the ionization energy (eV) of the upper level of\nthe transition and Z is the ionic charge of the trace element.\nThe \u0393 value is then converted into the FWHM 2w. Table 4\nshows that theoretical and experimental values of the widths\nand shifts due to electrons are in agreement but that the estimated width using the classical formula is in error. The\nStark shift due to electrons compares well with experiments\n(see Lesage 2009), although the shift due to protons is predicted to dominate (Dimitrijevi\u0107 & Sahal-Br\u00e9chot 1995). Incidentally, Dimitrijevi\u0107 & Sahal-Br\u00e9chot (1995) also predict\na pressure shift in the Mg ii\u03bb7989 multiplet of opposite sign\nand a factor of \u22488 larger than in the Mg ii\u03bb4481 doublet, in\nqualitative agreement with observations reported here and\nby Vennes, Kawka, & N\u00e9meth (2010a).\nIn step with our investigation of silicon lines, we also\ndeveloped two options for the analysis of the Mg ii\u03bb4481\ndoublet. In option 1 we adopted the NIST oscillator\nstrengths and the line broadening and shift parameters\n(proton and electron) from Dimitrijevi\u0107 & Sahal-Br\u00e9chot\n(1995). In option 2, we adopted the oscillator strengths from\nKurucz & Bell (1995) and the classical line broadening parameter while neglecting pressure shifts.\n3.1.3\n\n(\u00c5)\n\nCD23a\n2we\n(\u00c5)\n\n\u03bb0\n\nCa ii\n\nTable 5 compares theoretical and experimental results\nfor the Ca ii\u03bb3933 resonance line. Stark widths from\nvarious sources including Kurucz & Bell (1995) are in\n\nagreement although the pressure shifts calculated by\nDimitrijevi\u0107 & Sahal-Br\u00e9chot (1992) are a factor of 3\nsmaller than measured (Sre\u0107kovi\u0107 & Djeni\u017ee 1993). Because the measured Ca ii\u03bb3933 shift is relatively small (see\nVennes, Kawka, & N\u00e9meth 2010a) it may not be measurable\nin our spectra and the lack of accuracy in these parameters\nwould not affect the abundance and radial velocity analysis.\nAs part of option 1 we adopt the theoretical broadening and shift parameters of Dimitrijevi\u0107 & Sahal-Br\u00e9chot\n(1992) and in option 2 we adopt again the compilation of\nKurucz & Bell (1995) without pressure shifts.\n\n3.1.4\n\nO i and Fe ii\n\nThe analysis of weak spectral lines is sensitive to the assumed oscillator strengths but it is less sensitive to broadening parameters, and we will not distinguish the two options.\nThe O i\u03bb7773 oscillator strengths tabulated by\nKurucz & Bell (1995) and NIST differ by \u224810%\nwhich implies a minimum uncertainty in oxygen abundance measurements of the same order.\nBen Nessib, Lakhdar, & Sahal-Br\u00e9chot (1996) compared\ncalculated O i Stark width to Griem (1974) and to experiments. They found excellent agreement between their\ncalculations and the experimental values although they do\nnot provide data for the O i\u03bb7773 multiplet. The Stark\nwidth tabulated by Griem (1974) and Kurucz & Bell (1995)\nagree to within a few percent at T = 20000 appropriate for\nour analysis. We adopted the oscillator strengths and Stark\nwidths tabulated by Kurucz & Bell (1995).\nFive of the Fe ii lines detected in GALEX J1931+0117\nare listed at NIST while atomic data for all lines are listed by\nKurucz & Bell (1995). In this case, we adopted the oscillator strengths and Stark widths tabulated by Kurucz & Bell\n(1995).\n\n3.2\n\nDiffusion in white dwarf atmospheres\n\nA tenet of the accretion-diffusion scenario is that photospheric abundances reach a steady-state level in the lineforming region. The abundance gradient is assumed to\nbe zero in convective layers, but it is a function of the\ndiffusion time scale in radiative layers as in the case of\nGALEX J1931+0117.\nAssuming accretion steady-state the mass-continuity\nequation may be written as\nc 2010 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20139\n\n\fPressure shifts and abundance gradients in DAZ white dwarf\nc2 \u2261\n\nn2\n1\n1 \u03c41,2\n= \u1e402\n,\nn1\n4\u03c0R2 A2 m\n\n5\n\n(4)\n\nwhere c2 is the abundance of element \"2\" relative to the\nmain constituent \"1\", \u1e402 is the mass accretion rate of element \"2\" (g s\u22121 ), R is the stellar radius (cm), A2 is the\natomic weight of element \"2\" (a.m.u),\n\u03c41,2 = m/(\u03c1v1,2 )\n\n(5)\n\nis the diffusion time scale of element \"2\" (s), m and \u03c1 are\nthe mass loading (g cm\u22122 ) and density (g cm\u22123 ) in the atmosphere, and v1,2 is the diffusion velocity (cm s\u22121 ) given by\nthe diffusion equation. Assuming that element \"1\" is fully\nionized hydrogen (A1 = 1, Z1 = 1) and that c2 << 1, then\nthe diffusion equation (see Vennes et al. 1988) simplifies to\n\n\u0010\n\nv1,2 = D1,2 \u2212\n\nmp g\nmp gr\n1 d c2\n+ (1 \u2212 A2 )\n+ A2\n,\nc2 d r\nkT\nkT\n\n\u0011\n\n(6)\n\nwhere D1,2 is the diffusion coefficient of trace element \"2\" relative to the main constituent (see\nVennes, Kawka, & N\u00e9meth 2010b).\nThe first term on the right-hand side is the actual abundance gradient. We show in Section 3.3.3 that c2 is a slowly\nvarying function of density, c2 \u221d \u03c1\u03b1 and |\u03b1| . 0.5, therefore\n1 d c2\n1 d\u03c1\nd\u03c1\n.\u2212\n=\n,\nc2 d r\n\u03c1 dr\ndm\n\n(7)\n\nwhere dm = \u2212\u03c1 dr. The second term on the right-hand side\nof the diffusion equation is proportional to the surface gravity g and the last term is proportional to the radiative acceleration gr . Employing the run of density \u03c1 and temperature\nT as a function of mass loading m in a model atmosphere\nappropriate for GALEX J1931+0117, it can be shown that\ngravitational settling acts unimpeded as long as c2 << 1,\ni.e., that\nmp g\nd\u03c1\n<< (1 \u2212 A2 )\n.\ndm\nkT\n\n(8)\n\nThe abundance gradient term is . 2% of the gravity term\nand does not effectively counteract the gravitational pull.\nSimilarly, radiative forces (Chayer, Fontaine, & Wesemael\n1995; Chayer et al. 1995) are relatively weak at Teff \u2248\n20\u00d7103 K and cannot raise the abundances to levels observed\nin GALEX J1931+0117. The silicon abundance potentially\nsupported by radiation is at least 3.5 orders of magnitude\nbelow the observed abundance, and the radiative forces on\noxygen, magnesium, calcium, and iron are negligible.\nIn summary, unless a diffusion steady-state cannot be\nreached, the vertical abundance distribution in the atmosphere of an accreting white dwarf follows a relation of the\nform c2 \u221d \u03c41,2 /m and may depart significantly from a homogeneous distribution. Longitudinal homogeneity is assumed\nalthough abundance spots may in principle occur.\n\n3.3\n\nLine profile analysis\n\nDetailed line profiles are computed and convolved to the\ninstrumental resolution (R \u2248 46000). The separate routines\nwere introduced into the spectral synthesis code to treat\nStark shifts self-consistently. The Voigt profiles, that already\ninclude a treatment of Doppler width and damping functions\n(\u0393nat + \u0393Stark ) have been modified to include the effect of\nStark shifts. The line centre is shifted linearly with electronic\nc 2010 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20139\n\nFigure 1. Abundances measured in LTE with individual lines\nand using two separate atomic data sets. Set number 1 employs line broadening calculations of Lanz, Dimitrijevic, & Artru\n(1988) and oscillator strengths from Artru et al. (1981) and includes the effect of Stark shifts.

Table 6 lists the revised\nabundances.\n\n3.3.1\n\nLine broadening and pressure shift\n\nIn the present analysis we assume both longitudinal and\nvertical abundance uniformity. The lack of abundance variations between two observation epochs favours a uniform\nspread of trace elements across the surface although additional observations are required to rule out a mere coincidence in rotational phases. Figure 1 shows abundance measurements obtained for nine Si ii spectral lines in 20 separate\nmeasurements and Figure 2 shows sample line profile fits.\nThe revised silicon abundance is \u22120.05 dex (or 10%)\nlower than estimated by Vennes, Kawka, & N\u00e9meth (2010a)\nmainly because of the additional lines included in the analysis. In fact, the abundance measurements obtained assuming option 1 were on average 7% larger than with option\n2. However, as proposed in option 1, adopting the silicon\noscillator strengths and line-broadening parameters from\nLanz, Dimitrijevic, & Artru (1988) and Artru et al. (1981),\nrespectively, reduced the scatter in abundance measure-\n\n\f6\n\nS. Vennes et al.\n\nFigure 2. Line profile fits of spectra obtained at epoch 2 and corresponding to abundances depicted in the top panel of Figure 1.\n\nments based on 20 separate measurements. The scatter\nin abundance measurements obtained with option 1 was\n\u03c3 = 0.08 while the scatter obtained with option 2 was\nlarger, \u03c3 = 0.13, while the measurements showed a definite\nwavelength-dependent trend (Fig. 1).\nMoreover, the inclusion of Stark shifts in line profile\nmodelling reduced the scatter in Si ii line velocity measurements. The standard deviation of the measurements is\n\u03c3v = 2.8 without shifts down to \u03c3v = 0.9 km s\u22121 with Stark\nshifts included. The average line velocity is v\u0304 = \u22120.8 relative\nto vH\u03b1 = 37.2 km s\u22121 without Stark shifts and 0.0 km s\u22121\nwith Stark shifts included. The modelling of the spectral\nlines with the largest expected Stark shifts has been considerably improved by taking this effect into account (Fig. 2).\nFigure 3 compares Si ii line profiles computed with and without Stark shifts to the observed spectra. The zero velocity\nis set by the H\u03b1 line core (+37.2 km s\u22121 ). The line asymmetry in \u03bb5055 is due in part to the presence of a weaker Si ii\nline over the extended red wing, but the asymmetric profile in \u03bb5041 is entirely due to the Stark shift. The velocity\ndiscrepancy notable for these two lines is entirely resolved\nusing Stark shifted profiles.\nThe calcium abundance was revised slightly down by\n\u22120.06 dex (or 14%) mainly because of a small increase in\nthe adopted Stark width. The effect of pressure shift was\nnot noticeable. We estimated the error on the abundance\nmeasurements by assuming an uncertainty of 25% on the\nbroadening parameter. The corresponding uncertainty on\nthe abundance is 0.05 dex or 10%.\nOur revised magnesium abundance is significantly lower\nthan originally estimated by Vennes, Kawka, & N\u00e9meth\n(2010a) entirely because of an upward revision of the Stark\nwidth by a factor of two in better agreement with experimental measurements (Table 4). We also estimated the abundance error assuming a 25% uncertainty, i.e., at least the\ndifference between theory and experiments, on the broaden-\n\nFigure 3. Spectra obtained at epoch 2 are fitted with model line\nprofiles including Stark shifts (full lines) or excluding the effect\n(dashed lines). The velocity shift in the observed line profiles is\nwell reproduced by models including Stark shifts.\n\ning parameter. The corresponding uncertainty on the abundance is 0.07 dex or 15%.\nThe iron abundance, now based on nine separate line\nmeasurements, is, within errors, identical to the original\nestimate. The error was set to the standard deviation of\nthe set of measurements. The procedure adequately propagates uncertainties in broadening parameters and oscillator\nstrengths. However, variations of 25% on the Stark width\nhad no effect on the line equivalent widths. Similarly, the\noxygen abundance is identical to the original estimate, and\nthe error was set to the corresponding uncertainty in oscillator strengths (10%). Variations in the Stark width had no\neffect on the equivalent widths because weak lines such as\nFe ii and O i lie on the linear part of the curve-of-growth\nand are insensitive to broadening parameters unlike strong\nMg ii, Si ii, or Ca ii lines.\n3.3.2\n\nNon-LTE effects on abundance measurements\n\nWe measured the abundances using the grid of LTE spectra\nand compared them to the non-LTE results. We found that\nnon-LTE effects are the largest in highly-excited Si ii lines.\nThe average non-LTE shift on abundance measurements is\n\u2206 log Si/H = log Si/HNLTE \u2212 log Si/HLTE = +0.08 \u00b1 0.03\nThe abundance shift is \u2248 +0.05 for spectral lines with the\nlower levels 3s3p2 (2 D) or 3s2 4s(2 S), and \u2248 +0.11 for highlyexcited lines with the lower levels 3s2 3d(2 D) or 3s2 4p(2 Po ).\nA similar comparison of magnesium, calcium, and iron\nabundances show that non-LTE effects are small:\n\u2206 log Mg/H = \u22120.02\n\u2206 log Ca/H = \u22120.02\n\u2206 log Fe/H = +0.01\nc 2010 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20139\n\n\fPressure shifts and abundance gradients in DAZ white dwarf\nFinally, the abundance of oxygen measured with highlyexcited multiplet O i\u03bb7773 is relatively large:\n\nTable 6. Revised non-LTE abundances in GALEX J1931+0117.\n\n\u2206 log O/H = \u22120.13\nIn summary, non-LTE effects are notable in highly-excited\nlines of non-dominant species such as O i, but are negligible\nin strong lines of dominant species such as Ca ii or Mg ii.\nHighly-excited levels of Si ii are also affected.\n3.3.3\n\nEffect of abundance gradient on line profiles\n\nWe investigated the effect of vertical abundance inhomogeneities in the calculation of a spectral line syntheses.\nThe depth-dependent abundance was calculated by fixing\nthe accretion rate \u1e40 and the stellar radius R and varying the diffusion time-scale \u03c41,2 as a function of mass\nloading m as described in Section 3.2. We computed the\ntime-scale and corresponding diffusion velocity following\nVennes, Kawka, & N\u00e9meth (2010a). The effect of neutral\nspecies on element-averaged velocities was investigated by\nexcluding them from the diffusion velocity calculations and\ncomparing the resulting abundance profiles.\nFigure 4 (left) shows that in the line forming region\nthe abundance ratio c2 \u2261 n2 /n1 can be approximated by\nc2 \u221d \u03c1\u03b1 where \u22120.44 . \u03b1 . 0.54, or |\u03b1| . 0.5. The simulations confirm that, in this context, the abundance gradients\nare not steep enough to counteract gravity (Section 3.2). The\neffect of neutral species on element-averaged diffusion velocities are more marked in the cases of carbon and oxygen because of the relatively high C i and O i ionization potentials.\nIn the case of oxygen the assumed location of the photosphere bears heavily of the derived accretion rate and other\nelements may be affected as well. In order to remedy the situation we computed new emerging line profiles parametrized\nby a constant accretion rate, i.e., an accretion steady-state,\nrather than a constant abundance throughout the photosphere. These non-LTE spectral syntheses were calculated\nby adopting the structure (T, \u03c1) of the best-fitting homogeneous model and introducing the abundance distribution\nprescribed by Equation 4. The observed spectra were then\nfitted with the model grid and the accretion rates were measured explicitly.\nTable 7 lists measured accretion rates for C, O, Mg,\nSi, Ca, and Fe. The quoted errors are statistical only and\ndo not include systematic errors in modelling the diffusion\nflow. Calculated concentrations in the line forming region\nare inversely proportional to diffusion coefficients and errors\nwould scale accordingly, i.e., an error of 50% on theoretical\ndiffusion coefficients would propagate to calculated concentrations. Figure 4 (left) shows the corresponding abundance\nprofiles. The inferred abundances at three different locations\nin the photospheres (marked with arrows) are in good agreement with the abundance derived from homogeneous models\nin the case silicon, and they deviate slightly in the case of\nmagnesium and iron. Figure 4 (right) shows model spectra compared to the observed spectrum at three accretion\nrates. Although abundance inhomogeneities may affect line\nprofiles, in particular in the relative strength of line core\nand line wings, a comparison of ultraviolet to optical line\nstrengths may be more revealing, particularly for ultraviolet\noxygen lines.\nThe inferred chemical composition of the accretion flow\nc 2010 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20139\n\n7\n\nX\n\nn(X)/n(H)\n\n[X/H] a\n\nCb\nO\nMg\nSi\nCa\nFe\n\n< 7 \u00d7 10\u22125\n2.4 \u00b1 0.3 \u00d7 10\u22124\n3.8 \u00b1 0.6 \u00d7 10\u22125\n5.8 \u00b1 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22125\n7.7 \u00b1 0.8 \u00d7 10\u22127\n3.7 \u00b1 0.8 \u00d7 10\u22125\n\n< \u22120.54\n\u22120.28\n0.05\n0.25\n\u22120.42\n0.12\n\na [X/H]\u2261 log n(X)/n(H) \u2212 log n(X)/n(H)\n\u2299\nb From Vennes, Kawka, & N\u00e9meth (2010a).\nTable 7.

Table 7 list the\ncorresponding abundance ratios relative to solar ratios. The\nresults show that oxygen must be supplied in larger proportions that afforded by a solar composition, and that silicon is\nalso supplied in larger proportions than carbon, magnesium,\nor calcium. Iron is apparently supplied in solar proportions\nrelative to oxygen.\nIn summary, a line profile analysis parametrized by accretion rates rather than constant abundances reveals an\noxygen enrichment in the accretion flow. Diffusion calculations show the dominant effect of neutral species on abundance profiles.\n\n4\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe presented a model atmosphere analysis of the highmetallicity white dwarf GALEX J1931+0117. Based on\na critical review of available atomic data, their uncertainties, and their impact on the accuracy of abundance\nmeasurements, we revised the abundances presented by\nVennes, Kawka, & N\u00e9meth (2010a). The variations are not\nsignificant with the exception of magnesium which is revised downward by a factor of two. The abundance pattern\nshows that the abundance of magnesium, silicon, and iron is\nnear or above the solar abundance, while the abundance of\ncarbon, oxygen and calcium is below the solar abundance.\nA line profile analysis performed using vertical abundance\ndistributions obtained by solving the steady-state diffusion\nequation shows that the accretion flow is rich in oxygen and\nsilicon while it is depleted in other elements. The calculations show that although the oxygen abundance is below so-\n\n\f8\n\nS. Vennes et al.\n\nFigure 4. (Left) vertical abundance distribution of elements in the atmosphere of GALEX J1931+0117 computed assuming diffusive\nsteady-state (Section 3.2) and typical accretion rates \u1e40 in g s\u22121 (full lines). The effect of neutral species on element-averaged diffusion\nvelocities and vertical abundance distributions is shown by excluding neutral species from the calculations (dashed lines). The profiles\nare compared to measured abundances from Table 6 (dotted lines). The locations of optical depth 2/3 at \u03bb = 1260\u00c5 (rightmost) and in\nthe line wings and center (leftmost) are shown with arrows. (Right) spectrum obtained at epoch 2 (jagged line) compared to model line\nprofiles assuming Mg accretion rates \u1e40 = 3.2, 5.6, and 10 \u00d7 107 g s\u22121 .\n\nlar in the line forming region, it must be supplied in larger\nquantity because of its short diffusion time-scale relative to\nother elements.\nOn the other hand, we show that introducing Stark\nshifts in line profile modelling helped reduce the scatter in\nline velocity measurements to well within the expected accuracy of the echelle spectra. Investigations of the effect of\npressure shifts on radial velocity measurements are relatively\nrare but their effect have been predicted (e.g., Hammond\n1989; Kr\u0161ljanin & Dimitrijevi\u0107 1992). A lack of radial velocity variations between two epochs that are 123 days apart\nalso rules out a close binary scenario for the origin of the\naccreted material. We are left with the possibility that the\ninfrared excess belongs to a warm disc of debris material\nthat accretes onto the white dwarf surface.\nThe iron abundance in GALEX J1931+0117 is nearly\nsolar (Asplund, Grevesse, & Sauval 2005) and it is comparable to the iron abundance measured in much hotter white\ndwarfs (Vennes et al. 2006). The resurgence of iron in cooler\nwhite dwarfs is also evidence that an external reservoir\nreached the surface of these objects.\nSimulated infrared spectral energy distributions for\nGALEXJ1931+0117 including a spectral synthesis of the\nwhite dwarf added to a warm disc show that the observed distribution (Vennes, Kawka, & N\u00e9meth 2010a) can\nbe matched by a warm disc (900 K) or a hot disc (1650\nK) near sublimation temperature. Necessarily, the inferred\ndust temperature must be below sublimation temperatures\n(see Lodders 2003) for the main constituents such as calcium\n(1659 K), or silicon and magnesium (1354 K). Therefore, the\ntemperature as well as the size and state (gas or solid) of the\ndisc is the result of an adjustment with the host white dwarf\n\ntemperature and luminosity. The corresponding disc sizes\nare 90\u03a9W D for the hot disc, and, compensating for its reduced emissivity per unit area, 2200\u03a9W D for the warm disc,\nwhere \u03a9W D is the solid angle subtended by the white dwarf\nitself. The observed spectral energy distribution extends to\nthe 2MASS measurements in the infrared and measurements\nat longer wavelengths are required to further constrain the\nmodel.\n\nA comparison with other warm DAZ white dwarfs supports these conjectures. The DAZ PG1015+161 (Teff =\n19300 K, log g = 7.9, log Ca/H = \u22125.9, Koester & Wilken\n2006) is similar to GALEX1931+0117 (Teff = 20890 K,\nlog g = 7.9, log Ca/H = \u22126.1). Based on JHK and Spitzer\nobservations, Jura, Farihi, & Zuckerman (2007) inferred the\npresence of a disc with an inner temperature ranging from\n800 to 1000 K and emitting area from 700 to 1200 \u03a9W D .\nIn a similar case, Farihi, Jura, & Zuckerman (2009) inferred\nthe presence of a disc with a blackbody temperature of\n1500K around PG1457-086 (Teff = 20400 K, log g = 8.0,\nlog Ca/H = \u22126.1). The great diversity in disc emissivity is\nillustrated by the case of HS0047+1903. Despite having a\nsimilar calcium abundance, no evidence of a disc is found in\nJHK and Spitzer observations (Farihi et al. 2010b).\n\nIn conclusion, our analysis of the abundance pattern in\nGALEXJ1931+0117 and the absence of a close companion,\nas well as a comparison with other, similar cases such as the\nDAZ PG1015+161 support the likely presence of a dusty\ndisc around GALEXJ1931+0117.\nc 2010 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20139\n\n\fPressure shifts and abundance gradients in DAZ white dwarf\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nS.V. and A.K. are supported by GA AV grant numbers\nIAA300030908 and IAA301630901, respectively, and by\nGA \u010cR grant number P209/10/0967.
