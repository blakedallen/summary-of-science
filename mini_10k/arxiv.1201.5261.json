We compute the hyperbolic covolume of the automorphism\ngroup of each even unimodular Lorentzian lattice. The result is obtained as a consequence of a previous work with Belolipetsky, which\nuses Prasad's volume to compute the volumes of the smallest hyperbolic arithmetic orbifolds.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet Hn be the hyperbolic n-space, of constant curvature \u22121. We denote\nby Isom(Hn ) the group of isometries of Hn . One way to construct a lattice\nin Isom(Hn ) is to consider the automorphism group O(L) of a Lorentzian\nlattice L \u2282 Rn,1 . Of particular interest are the unimodular Lorentzian lattices. There exist two such types of lattices: the odd unimodular Lorentzian\nlattice In,1 and the even unimodular Lorentzian lattice IIn,1 . Their study\nappears in connection with the study of Euclidean lattices, as shown in the\nbook of Conway and Sloane [4]. While In,1 exists for every dimension n, the\neven lattice IIn,1 exists only when n \u2261 1 mod 8.\nIn [2] (see also [5]) the following theorem was proved.\nTheorem 0. For each odd dimension n = 2r \u2212 1 \u2265 5, there is a unique orientable non-compact arithmetic hyperbolic n-orbifold \u2206n \\Hn of the smallest\nvolume (with \u2206n an arithmetic lattice of Isom(Hn )). Its volume is given by:\nr\u22121\nY\n\n(2j \u2212 1)!\n\u03b6(2j)\n(2\u03c0)2j\nj=1\n\nif n \u2261 1 mod 8;\n\n(2)\n\nr\u22121\nY (2j \u2212 1)!\n(2r \u2212 1)(2r\u22121 \u2212 1)\n\u03b6(r)\n\u03b6(2j)\n3 * 2r\u22121\n(2\u03c0)2j\nj=1\n\nif n \u2261 5 mod 8;\n\n(3)\n\nr\u22121\nY (2j \u2212 1)!\n3r\u22121/2\n\u221a\nL\n\u03b6(2j)\n(r)\nQ( \u22123)|Q\nr\u22121\n2\n(2\u03c0)2j\nj=1\n\nif n \u2261 3 mod 4.\n\n(1)\n\n1\n2r\u22122\n\n\u03b6(r)\n\nIt is remarkable that the smallest volume has the simplest form (1) exactly\nfor the dimensions n where the even unimodular Lorentzian lattice IIn,1\nexists.

Theorem 1). In particular, this allows\nto deduce in Corollary 2 the hyperbolic covolume of the automorphism group\nO(IIn,1 ). This complements the work of Ratcliffe and Tschantz [8], where\nthe covolume of O(In,1 ) was determined for every n.\nIn \u00a73\u20134 we discuss some interesting consequences of our main result. Finally, in \u00a75 we discuss the case of Formulas (2)\u2013(3). In particular, we state in\nProposition 4 the exact relation between \u2206n and O(In,1 ) when n \u2261 5 mod 8.\nAcknowledgements.

Main result and its proof\nFor n \u2261 1 mod 8, we consider the even unimodular lattice IIn,1 embedded\nin the real quadratic space equipped with the standard rational quadratic\nform:\n(4)\n\nq(x) = \u2212x20 + x21 + * * * + x2n .\n\nThe group of automorphisms of this quadratic space acts then isometrically on Hn , via an identification of Hn with its projective model. The\ngroup O(IIn,1 ) (resp. SO(IIn,1 )) of automorphisms (resp. special automorphisms) preserving q and the lattice IIn,1 acts discontinuously on Hn .\nMore precisely, the group PO(IIn,1 ) = O(IIn,1 )/{\u00b1I} (resp. PSO(IIn,1 ) =\nSO(IIn,1 )/{\u00b1I}), where I is the identity matrix, can be seen as a discrete\nsubgroup of Isom(Hn ).\nTheorem 1. For n \u2261 1 mod 8, the group \u2206n is conjugate in Isom(Hn ) to\nPSO(IIn,1 ).\nProof. We denote by V the quadratic space over Q equipped with quadratic\nform 12 q, where q is given in (4). Let G be the algebraic group defined over\nQ with G(Q) = Spin(V ), the group of spinors of V . Let G be the adjoint\nform of G. Then G(R) is isomorphic to Isom(Hn ). For each prime p we\nconsider the quadratic space Vp = V \u2297Q Qp , and the Bruhat-Tits building\nBp associated with Spin(Vp ) and SO(Vp ). Note that G and G are split over\nQp , for every prime p (cf. [2, Prop. 3.9]).\nLet L be the lattice in V that identifies to IIn,1 via the embedding in\nthe quadratic space (V \u2297Q R, q). For each prime p, we consider the lattice\nLp = L \u2297 Zp , which is a maximal lattice in Vp [3, \u00a75]. Bruhat-Tits theory\nallows to identify the lattice Lp as an hyperspecial point of the building Bp\n(cf. [3, \u00a75]), whose stabilizer in SO(Vp ) is SO(Lp ).\n\n\fEVEN UNIMODULAR LORENTZIAN LATTICES AND HYPERBOLIC VOLUME\n\n3\n\nLet us denote by Kp the hyperspecial parahoric subgroup of Spin(Vp ) that\nstabilizes Lp \u2208 Bp . The set of all these Kp for p prime is a coherent collection\nof parahoric subgroups, and this defines a principal arithmetic subgroup of\nG(Q) (see [2, \u00a72.2] for details):\n(5)\n\n\u039b = G(Q) \u2229\n\nY\n\nKp ,\n\np\n\nwhich by construction maps into SO(L) = SO(IIn,1 ). But \u039b corresponds\nexactly to the group \u039b1 in [2], whose image in G(R) gives the group \u2206n . It\nwas proved in [2] that \u039b1 is maximal, and that up to conjugacy its construction does not depend on the choice of a coherent collection of hyperspecial\nsubgroups. It follows that PSO(IIn,1 ) is conjugate to \u2206n in Isom(Hn ). \u0003\nFrom Theorem 0 and 1 we obtain the covolume of the group PO(IIn,1 ),\nwhich contains PSO(IIn,1 ) as a subgroup of index two. In order to simplify\neven more the volume formula, we use the well-known expression of \u03b6(2j)\nin terms of the Bernoulli number B2j .\nCorollary 2. The covolume of the action of PO(IIn,1 ) on Hn equals\n(6)\n\n\u03b6(r)\n\nr\u22121\nY\n\n|B2j |\n,\n8j\nj=1\n\nwhere Bk is the k-th Bernoulli number.\n3. Volume of Coxeter polytopes\nCorollary 2 was already known in dimension n = 9 (see \u00a75), where PO(II9,1 )\nis the Coxeter group generated by reflections through the faces of a simplex.\nThe only other group PO(IIn,1 ) that is reflective is PO(II17,1 ), as it follows\nform the work of Conway and Vinberg (cf. [4, Ch. 27] and [11, Part II Ch. 6\n\u00a72.1]). It contains as a subgroup of index two the following Coxeter group:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n(7)\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nCorollary 3. Let P \u2282 H17 be a Coxeter polytope corresponding to the diagram (7). Then\n691 * 3617\nvolH (P ) = 38 10 4 2\n\u03b6(9)\n2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17\n\u2248 2.072451981 * 10\u221218 .\nIt is not clear how one could compute precisely the volume of such an\nhigh- and odd-dimensional hyperbolic polytope without an identification\nwith the fundamental domain of an arithmetic group. Steve Tschantz was\nable to compute the following numerical approximation, which agrees with\nthe result of Corollary 3.\n(8)\n\nvolH (P ) = 2.069 * 10\u221218 \u00b1 2.4 * 10\u221220 .\n\n\f4\n\nVINCENT EMERY\n\nThe computation took about 60 hours, showing that for this kind of polytopes even numerical computation is not an easy task.\nIt is most likely that P realizes the smallest volume among all hyperbolic\nCoxeter polytopes (non-compact or not), independently of the dimension.\nThe results of [5, 2] (odd dimensions) and [1] (even dimensions) determine\nthe smallest possible arithmetic orientable hyperbolic orbifolds. From them\nwe see that a Coxeter polytope smaller than P and being the fundamental\ndomain of an arithmetic group must necessarily lie in H17 , be commensurable to P , and have exactly half of the volume of P . We don't know if such\na Coxeter polytope could exist.\nThe small size of P can also be explained by Schl\u00e4fli differential formula\nfor the volume of polytopes (see [11, Part I Ch. 7 \u00a72.2]). According to this\nformula, the volume of Coxeter polytopes tends to be smaller for polytopes\nhaving large dihedral angles. The small size of P results then from the\ncombination of two factors: the only dihedral angles in P are \u03c0/2 and \u03c0/3;\nand relatively to its dimension, P is determined by few hyperplanes (actually\nthe smallest possible number in H17 ). These two conditions are a very rare\noccurrence in high dimensions.\n\n4. Comparison with the mass formula\nThe lattice II25,1 plays an important role in connection with the study\nof even unimodular Euclidean lattices in dimension 24 (see [4, Theorem 5,\nCh. 26]). For n \u2261 1 mod 8, let Ln\u22121 denotes the set (up to isomorphism) of\n(n \u2212 1)-dimensional even unimodular Euclidean lattices. This is a finite set,\nand an important invariant is its mass, defined as\n(9)\n\nmass(Ln\u22121 ) =\n\nX\nL\u2208Ln\u22121\n\n1\n.\n| O(L)|\n\nFor n = 9, 17 and 25 each group O(L) (with L \u2208 Ln\u22121 ) appears as a subgroup\nof O(IIn,1 ) as the stabilizer of a point at infinity of Hn . Therefore, the groups\nO(L) correspond to cusps of the hyperbolic orbifold defined by O(IIn,1 ), and\nmass(Ln\u22121 ) could be regarded as a measurement of the contribution from\nthese cusps to the volume. It is then quite natural to consider the ratio\n\"covolume of O(IIn,1 ) divided by mass(Ln\u22121 )\". From the mass formula [4,\nTheorem 2, Ch.16] we obtain the rather simple formula:\n(10)\n\n|B2r\u22122 |\ncovolume of O(IIn,1 )\n= 2\u2212r\n\u03b6(r).\nmass(Ln\u22121 )\n|Br\u22121 |\n\nNote that this ratio goes quickly to \u221e when r grows.\nWe refer to [10] for more precise results on the behaviour of cusps of\narithmetic orbifolds with respect to the dimension.\n\n\fEVEN UNIMODULAR LORENTZIAN LATTICES AND HYPERBOLIC VOLUME\n\n5\n\n5. The case of the other odd dimensions\nThe covolume of PO(In,1 ) was computed by Ratcliffe and Tschantz in all\ndimensions n > 1 [8]. They obtain the result by evaluating a formula due to\nSiegel. Note that Prasad's volume formula, the main ingredient to obtain\nTheorem 0, may be considered as a far-reaching extension of this formula\nof Siegel. Using the fact that PO(IIn,1 ) and PO(In,1 ) are commensurable,\nRatcliffe and Tschantz could also deduce the covolume of PO(II9,1 ) (cf. [6, p.\n345]). By the work of Vinberg and Kaplinskaya, the group PO(In,1 ) is known\nto be reflective for n \u2264 19, and combining this fact with the work of Ratcliffe\nand Tschantz one can obtain the volume of several Coxeter polytopes.\nBy its construction in [2], it is clear that for n \u2261 5 mod 8 the arithmetic\ngroup \u2206n of Theorem 0 is commensurable to PSO(In,1 ). Moreover, we can\nsee that the ratio of the covolumes of these two groups is equal to 3. In\nfact, using [3, Prop. 5.9] and the same kind of argument as in the proof of\nTheorem 1, we get the following result. It agrees with known facts about\nsimplices in dimension 5 (cf. [6, \u00a75]).\nProposition 4. For n \u2261 5 mod 8, the group PSO(In,1 ) is conjugate in\nIsom(Hn ) to a subgroup of index 3 in \u2206n .\nFor n \u2261 3 mod 4, the group \u2206n is not commensurable to PSO(In,1 ). Instead, it is commensurable to the group PO(f, Z) given by the integral automorphisms of the following quadratic form:\n(11)\n\nf = \u22123x20 + x21 + * * * + x2n .\n\nMcLeod showed that the group PO(f, Z) is reflective when n \u2264 13 [7]. Recently, elaborating on their earlier work on Siegel's formula (cf. [6, pp. 344\u2013\n345]), Ratcliffe and Tschantz determined the covolume of PO(f, Z) (thus\nobtaining the covolumes of McLeod's polytopes) [9]. For n \u2261 3 mod 4, the\nratio between the covolumes of PO(f, Z) and \u2206n is then computed to be\nequal to a(n)/4, where a(n) is some odd integer tending to \u221e when n \u2192 \u221e\n(see [9, (35)]). An alternative way to obtain the covolume of McLeod's polytopes would be to determine the relation between PO(f, Z) and \u2206n in terms\nof subgroup inclusions, using the same kind of arguments as for Theorem 1\nand Proposition 4.\nReferences\n1.
