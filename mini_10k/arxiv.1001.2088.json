Introduction\nIn this paper, we prove some results on Thurston's asymmetric metric on Teichm/\"uller space. This metric was introduced by Thurston in his paper ??.\nwe start by constructing Lipschitz homeomorphisms with controlled Lipschitz\nconstant between symmetric right-angled hyperbolic hexagons, that is, convex rightangled hyperbolic hexagons having three non-adjacent edges of equal length. Using\nthese Lipschitz homeomorphisms, we obtain, by doubling the hexagons, Lipschitz\nhomeomorphisms between symmetric hyperbolic pairs of pants, that is, hyperbolic\npairs of pants which have three geodesic boundary components of equal lengths.\nThese Lipschitz homeomorphisms between symmetric pairs of pants are extremal\nin the sense that their Lipschitz constant is minimal among all Lipschitz constants\nof homeomorphisms in the same isotopy class. But these Lipschitz extremal homeomorphisms between pairs of pants are not stretch maps in the sense of Thurston.\nBy varying the Lipschitz constants of the homeomorphisms we construct, we obtain\na path in the Teichm\u00fcller space of the pair of pants which actually coincides with a\nstretch line in the sense of Thurston, and we exploit the properties of such stretch\nlines.\nWe recall that stretch lines are geodesics with respect to Thurston's asymmetric\nmetric, defined by minimizing the Lipschitz constant between marked hyperbolic\nsurfaces.\nBy gluing pairs of pants along their boundary components, and by combining the\nmaps we construct between pairs of pants, we obtain stretch lines in the Teichm\u00fcller\nspace of hyperbolic surfaces of finite type, of arbitrary genus and of arbitrary number of boundary components, which are also geodesics (up to reparametrization), for\nDate: November 12, 2018.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nATHANASE PAPADOPOULOS AND GUILLAUME TH\u00c9RET\n\nThurston's asymmetric metric, when they are traversed in the opposite direction.\nThese are the first examples we know of such geodesics for this metric.\nWe also recall that by a result of Thurston, given any two points g and h in\nTeichm\u00fcller space, there is a unique maximally stretched chain-recurrent geodesic\nlamination \u03bc(g, h) from g to h which is maximal (with respect to inclusion), and that\nif g and h lie in that order on a stretch line directed by a complete chain-recurrent\ngeodesic lamination \u03bc, then \u03bc(g, h) = \u03bc. We obtain the following results that are\nvariations on this theme: We show that if two elements g and h in Teichm\u00fcller\nspace lie (in that order) on a stretch line we construct, the lamination \u03bc(g, h) is\nstrictly smaller than the lamination that directs that line, and that there are several\n(non chain-recurrent) maximal maximally stretched geodesic laminations from g to\nh. In other words, the stretch lines we construct are directed by complete geodesic\nlaminations that are not chain-recurrent, and unlike the chain-recurrent case, these\nlaminations are not uniquely defined.\n2. Thurston's stretch maps between hyperbolic ideal triangles and\nbetween pairs of pants\nIn this section, we recall the definition of a stretch map between hyperbolic ideal\ntriangles and between pairs of pants. This construction is due to Thurston (see\n[9]).\nWe start with a stretch map from a hyperbolic ideal triangle to itself.\nConsider a hyperbolic ideal triangle equipped with the partial foliation by horocyclic segments that are perpendicular to the boundary. Up to isometry, there is\na unique such object. There is a non-foliated region at the center of the triangle,\nbounded by three pieces of horocycles (see Figure 1). This horocyclic foliation is\nequipped with a natural transverse measure, which is characterized by the fact that\nthe transverse measure assigned to any arc contained in an edge of the ideal triangle\ncoincides with the Lebesgue measure induced by the hyperbolic metric.\nThe non-foliated region of a hyperbolic triangle intersects each edge of the triangle at a point called the center of that edge.\nhorocycles\nperpendicular\nto the boundary\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\nhorocyclic arc\nof length one\n\nnon-foliated\nregion\n\nFigure 1. The horocyclic foliation of an ideal triangle.\nLet T be the hyperbolic ideal triangle equipped with its horocyclic measured\nfoliation, and consider a real number k \u2265 1. The stretch map of magnitude k of T\nis a homeomorphism fk : T \u2192 T satisfying the following properties:\n(1) The restriction of fk to the non-foliated region of T is the identity map of\nthat region.\n(2) On each edge of T , fk sends any point at distance x from the center of that\nedge to a point at distance kx.\n\n\fLIPSCHITZ MAPS\n\n3\n\n(3) The map fk preserves the horocyclic foliation of T ; that is, it sends leaves\nto leaves.\n(4) On each leaf of the horocyclic foliation, fk contracts linearly the length of\nthat leaf.\nBy gluing stretch maps between ideal triangles we construct stretch maps between hyperbolic pairs of pants.\nA hyperbolic pair of pants is a sphere with three open disks removed, equipped\nwith a hyperbolic metric in which the three boundary components are closed\ngeodesics (the lift of such a curve to the hyperbolic universal cover seen as a subset\nof the hyperbolic plane H2 is a geodesic in H2 ).\nLet P be a hyperbolic pair of pants. We choose a complete geodesic lamination \u03bb\nin P . Such a complete geodesic lamination necessarily consists of three disjoint biinfinite geodesics that spiral around the boundary components of P , decomposing\nthat surface into two hyperbolic ideal triangles. The horocyclic measured foliations\nof the two ideal triangles fit together smoothly since they are both perpendicular\nto the edges of the ideal triangles, and therefore they form a Lipschitz line field on\nthe surface. For each k \u2265 1, consider a stretch map of magnitude k defined on each\nof the ideal triangles composing P . We obtain a new hyperbolic pair of pants Pk by\ngluing the ideal triangles together along their boundaries according to identifications\nthat are compatible with the stretch maps. This defines a homeomorphism from P\nto another hyperbolic pair of pants Pk , which is called a stretch map (of magnitude\nk) from P to Pk .\nThe above construction can be repeated on several copies of hyperbolic pairs of\npants. By gluing together these pairs of pants according to the identifications given\nby the stretch maps, we obtain a stretch map of magnitude k from a hyperbolic\nsurface S to another Sk . Note that the complete geodesic laminations giving the\ndecompositions into ideal triangles of the pairs of pants in S give, together with\nthe pants decomposition of S, a complete geodesic lamination on the surface S.\nRemark 2.1. The reader should be aware that stretch maps are actually defined\nin a much wider generality than the one presented here. The underlying complete\ngeodesic lamination giving the decomposition of the surface into ideal triangles\ncan be chosen arbitrarily among the complete geodesic laminations and it is not\nnecessarily the completion of a geodesic pants decomposition as above. However,\nin this paper, we shall only need the special case of stretch maps described above.\n3. Extremal Lipschitz maps between symmetric right-angled\nhexagons\nGiven two metric spaces (X, dX ) and (Y, dY ) and a map f : X \u2192 Y between\nthem, the Lipschitz constant Lip(f ) of f is defined as\n\u0001\ndY f (x), f (y)\n\u0001\n\u2208 R \u222a {\u221e}.\nLip(f ) = sup\ndX x, y\nx6=y\u2208X\n\nWe shall say that the map f is Lipschitz if its Lipschitz constant is finite.\nThe stretch maps fk between hyperbolic ideal triangles that we considered in the\nlast section are examples of Lipschitz homeomorphisms, with Lipschitz constant\nequal to k. Note that the fact that this Lipschitz constant is at least k can be seen\nfrom the action of these maps on the boundary of the ideal triangles. The fact that\nthe Lipschitz constant is exactly k is implicit in Thurston's paper [9]. It also follows\nfrom the computations below (see Remark 3.4). By using these maps as building\nblocks, we recalled in \u00a72 how one obtains Lipschitz homeomorphisms of hyperbolic\n\n\f4\n\nATHANASE PAPADOPOULOS AND GUILLAUME TH\u00c9RET\n\npairs of pants and, more generally, of hyperbolic surfaces. These stretch maps have\nLipschitz constants k.\nIn this section, we shall define Lipschitz maps between some particular hyperbolic\nright-angled hexagons, which will also have controlled Lipschitz constants, and\nwhich can be used to define Lipschitz homeomorphisms between special hyperbolic\npairs of pants, by gluing hyperbolic right-angled hexagons and taking the union of\nLipschitz maps between them. By gluing together these special pairs of pants in\nan appropriate manner, this will eventually yield homeomorphisms between special\nhyperbolic surfaces of arbitrary finite type, with controlled Lipschitz constants.\nA symmetric right-angled hexagon is a geodesic hexagon H in the hyperbolic\nplane H2 with three pairwise non-consecutive edges having the same length. (Note\nthat this implies that the remaining three edges also have the same length.)\nWe consider a symmetric right-angled hexagon H, and we choose three pairwise\nnon-consective edges of H, which we call the long edges. We denote their common\nlength by 2L. The other three non-consecutive edges are called short, and we denote\ntheir common length by 2l. An easy computation using well-known formulae for\nright-angled hexagons gives\n(1)\n\n2 sinh(l) sinh(L) = 1.\n\nFor each real number k \u2265 1, we let Hk be the symmetric right-angled hexagon\nobtained by multiplying the lengths of the long edges of H by the factor k. We\nnote that this property determines the isometry type of Hk in a unique way. We\ncall the edges of Hk that are the images of the long edges of H by this dilatation\nmap the long edges of Hk and we denote their common length by 2Lk . We let 2lk\ndenote the length of the other edges of Hk , which we call the short ones.\nIn this section, all the maps between symmetric right-angled hexagons that we\nshall consider will be homeomorphisms sending the long (respectively short) edges\nto the long (respectively short) edges, and in general we shall not repeat this condition.\nThe three lengths of any three non-consecutive edges of H (respectively of Hk )\nsatisfy the triangle inequality. Therefore, we can equip H (respectively Hk ) with\na partial measured foliations F (respectively Fk ) whose leaves are loci of equidistant points from the short edges. In the hyperbolic plane, equidistant points from\ngeodesics are classicaly called hypercycles, and we shall use this terminology. The\nfoliations of H (respectively Hk ) by hypercycles are shown in Figure 2, and such\nfoliations have already been considered by Thurston in his compactification theory of Teichm\u00fcller space (see [2, expos\u00e9 6]). There is a non-foliated region of F\n(respectively Fk ) at the center of H (respectively Hk ).\nThe intersection number of F (respectively, Fk ) with an edge of H (respectively,\nHk ) is either 2L or 0 (respectively, 2kL or 0) depending on whether the edge is long\nor short.\nWe also equip H (respectively Hk ) with the partial foliation G (respectively Gk )\nwhose leaves are geodesic arcs perpendicular to the leaves of F (respectively Fk ).\nIn Theorem 3.3, we shall construct a map, hk : H \u2192 Hk which (leafwise) sends\nF to Fk , and G to Gk and whose Lipschitz constant is k. Such a map is Lipschitzextremal in its homotopy class relative to the boundary, since the Lipschitz constant\nof any map f : H \u2192 Hk which sends long (respectively short) edges of H to long\n(respectively short) edges of Hk is bounded below by k. The Lipschitz-extremal\nmaps we shall construct are \"canonical\" in the sense that they preserve a pair of hypercyclic/geodesic foliations, and they are reminiscent of Thurston's stretch maps\nbetween ideal triangles. In some precise sense that we specify below, Thurston's\nstretch maps between ideal triangles are limits of the Lipschitz-extremal maps between symmetric hexagons.\n\n\fLIPSCHITZ MAPS\n\n5\n\nBefore defining the map hk , we make a geometrical remark. Consider the family\nof all symmetric right-angled hexagons Hk as k varies from 1 to infinity. Each of\nthese hexagons has a center which is the center of the rotation that permutes each\ntriple of non-consecutive edges. For each such hexagon, consider the three geodesic\nrays emanating from its center and meeting the short edges perpendicularly. Place\nall the hexagons Hk in the hyperbolic plane so that all their centers coincide and\nsuch that all the above geodesic rays coincide as well. Now for each such hexagon\nb k defined as the region of infinite\nHk , consider the associated extended hexagon H\narea enclosed by the three geodesics in H2 extending the long edges of Hk . It follows\nfrom Equation (1) that as Lk decreases, lk increases, and conversely. From this, we\nbk .\nb k\u2032 \u2282 H\ndeduce that for any 1 \u2264 k \u2264 k \u2032 , we have H\nb k as well as the\nWe also note that as k tends to infinity, the extended hexagon H\nhexagon Hk itself converge, in the Hausdorff topology associated to the Euclidean\nmetric (using as in Figure 3 the disk-model of the hyperbolic plane) to an ideal\ntriangle. Likewise, as k \u2192 \u221e, the measured foliation Fk converges to the horocyclic\nfoliation of the ideal triangle (represented in Figure 1) and the non-foliated region\nof Fk converges to the non-foliated region of that horocyclic foliation.\nThe following two lemmas will be used in the proof of Theorem 3.3 below.\nLemma 3.1. For k \u2032 > k \u2265 1, the non-foliated region of Fk\u2032 is strictly contained in\nthe non-foliated region of Fk .\nProof. We work in the disk model of the hyperbolic plane. The statement will\nfollow from the construction of the symmetric hexagons, represented in Figure 3.\nIn the upper part of that figure, the hexagon Hk (also with its edges extended) is\ndrawn in bold lines, and the hexagon Hk\u2032 (with its edges extended) is drawn in\ndashed lines. We have chosen the hexagons to be symmetric with respect to the\nEuclidean center O of the unit disk. In the upper figure, the point p (respectively\nq) is the Euclidean center of the hypercycle that is on the boundary of non-foliated\nregion of Hk (respectively Hk\u2032 ). The point a (respectively b) is a vertex of the nonfoliated region of Fk (respectively Fk\u2032 ). A more detailed view of a region drawn\nin the the upper part of Figure 3 is represented in the lower part. The point a\u2032\n(respectively b\u2032 ) is the center of a boundary hypercycle of the non-foliated region\nof Fk (respectively Fk\u2032 ). The Euclidean triangles Opa and Oqb are homothetic\nby a Euclidean homothety of center O and factor < 1. This homothety sends\nthe Euclidean circle arc aa\u2032 to the Euclidean circle arc bb\u2032 . Thus, there exists a\nEuclidean homothety of center O that sends the non-foliated region of Hk\u2032 strictly\ninto the non-foliated region of Hk , which proves the lemma.\n\u0003\n\nPSfrag replacements\nA\nB\nFigure 2.

Since, by definition, a map\nhk : H \u2192 Hk sends the long edges of H to the long edges of Hk , we immediately\nget Lip(hk ) \u2265 k. This proves the second part of the theorem.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.4. We already observed that, reasoning in the disk model of the hyperbolic plane and using the notion of Hausdorff convergence on bounded closed\nsubsets of that disk with respect to the underlying Euclidean metric, we can make\na sequence of symmetric right-angled hexagons converge to an hyperbolic ideal\ntriangle, in such a way that the following three properties hold:\n(1) The partial measured foliation of the hexagons by hypercycles converges to\nthe partial measured foliation of the hyperbolic ideal triangle by horocycles.\n(2) The partial foliation of the hexagons by geodesics perpendicular to the foliation by hypercycles converges to the partial foliation of the ideal triangle by\ngeodesics perpendicular to the horocycles.\n(3) The non-foliated regions of the hexagons converge to the non-foliated region\nof the ideal triangle.\nFurthermore, for all k \u2265 1, we can make the convergence of hexagons to the ideal\ntriangle in such a way that k-Lipschitz maps fk : H \u2192 Hk converge uniformly on\ncompact sets to the stretch maps fk : T \u2192 T between hyperbolic ideal triangles.\nThis shows in particular that the stretch maps fk have Lipschitz constant k.\nWe note that Lipschitz maps between pairs of pants are also considered by Otal\nin his paper [4], in relation with the Weil-Petersson metric of Teichm\u00fcller space.\n4. Asymmetric metrics on Teichm\u00fcller spaces of surfaces with or\nwithout boundary\nIn this section, S is a surface of finite type (g, b), which may have empty or\nnonempty boundary (g denotes the genus of S and b the number of boundary components). We assume that the Euler characteristic of S is negative. The hyperbolic\nstructures we construct on S are such that all the boundary components are closed\nsmooth geodesics. We denote by T(S) or by Tg,b the Teichm\u00fcller space of S, that\nis, the space of homotopy classes of hyperbolic metrics on that surface.\n\n\fLIPSCHITZ MAPS\n\n11\n\nGiven two hyperbolic structures X and Y on S, we define\n(2)\n\nL(X, Y ) = log inf Lip(f )\nf\n\nwhere the infimum is taken over the set of Lipschitz homeomorphisms f : X \u2192 Y\nthat are homotopic to the identity.\nLemma 4.1 (Thurston). For any two hyperbolic metrics X and Y on S, if L(X, Y ) \u2264\n0, then X and Y are isometric by a homeomorphism that is homotopic to the identity.\nProof. We follow Thurston's proof of the corresponding result in the case of surfaces without boundary, cf. [9, Proposition 2.1]. Since L(X, Y ) \u2264 0, there exists a\nsequence of homeomorphisms fn : X \u2192 Y , n = 0, 1, . . ., with Lipschitz constants\nLip(fn ) converging to a real number L \u2264 1. The sequence (fn ) is uniformly equicontinuous, therefore up to taking a subsequence, we can assume that (fn ) converges\nuniformly to a map f : X \u2192 Y . We have Lip(f ) = L \u2264 0. We now prove that f is\nsurjective. Take a point y in Y , and for all n \u2265 0, let xn = fn\u22121 (y). Up to taking a\nsubsequence of (fn ), we can assume, by compactness, that xn \u2192 x \u2208 X. We show\nthat f (x) = y. Let us fix some \u01eb > 0. We have\n|f (x) \u2212 y| = |f (x) \u2212 fn (xn )| \u2264 |f (x) \u2212 fn (x)| + |fn (x) \u2212 fn (xn )|.\nSince fn \u2192 f uniformly, there exists N \u2265 0 such that for all n \u2265 N , we have\n|f (x) \u2212 fn (x)| \u2264 \u01eb/2. Since the family (fn ) is equicontinuous, there exists \u03b4 > 0\nsuch that for x1 and x2 satisfying |x1 \u2212 x2 | < \u03b4, we have |fm (x1 ) \u2212 fm (x2 )| \u2264 \u01eb/2\nfor all m \u2265 0.\nSince xn \u2192 x, there exists N \u2032 such that for all n \u2265 N \u2032 , we have |x \u2212 xn | < \u03b4.\nFor n \u2265 max{N, N \u2032 }, we have, for all m, |fm (x) \u2212 fm (xn )| \u2264 \u01eb/2. In particular,\nfor m = n, |fn (x) \u2212 fn (xn )| \u2264 \u01eb/2. This shows that for every \u01eb > 0, we have\n|f (x) \u2212 y| \u2264 \u01eb. Thus, f (x) = y. This shows that f is surjective.\nWe cover S by a set of geometric disks with disjoint interior whose total area is\nequal to the area of X. The metrics X and Y have the same area. Since Lip(f ) \u2264 1\nand since f is surjective, the image by f of a disk of radius R is a disk of radius R.\nFurthermore, f sends the boundary of any such disk to the boundary of the image\ndisk. We deduce that any geometric disk is sent by f isometrically to a geometric\ndisk of the same radius. Furthermore, it is easy to see that the center of such a\ndisk is sent to the center of the image disk.\nFrom this, we deduce that f is locally distance-preserving. This implies that f\nis an isometry.\n\u0003\nWe call an asymmetric metric on a set X a function that satisfies the axioms of\na metric except the symmetry axiom, and that does not satisfy this axiom.\nProposition 4.2. The function L defined in (2) is an asymmetric metric on the\nTeichm\u00fcller space T(S).\nProof. By Lemma 4.1, L is nonnegative and separates points. The triangle inequality is obviously satisfied. The fact that the metric does not satisfy the symmetry\naxiom can be seen using an example analogous to the one showing the corresponding\nresult for surfaces without boundary, given by Thurston in [9].\n\u0003\nWe let S be the set of isotopy classes of simple closed curves on S which are not\nhomotopic to a point (the boundary components of S are included).\nThe asymmetric metric L is an analogue, for surfaces with boundary, of the\nasymmetric metric defined by Thurston in [9] for surfaces without boundary. In\n\n\f12\n\nATHANASE PAPADOPOULOS AND GUILLAUME TH\u00c9RET\n\nthe same paper, Thurston defined the following function on the Teichm\u00fcller space\nT(S) of a surface S without boundary:\n(3)\n\nly (C)\n.\nl\nC\u2208S x (C)\n\nK(x, y) = log sup\n\nThurston proved that we obtain the same function K if instead of taking the\ninfimum over the elements of S in (3) we take the infimum over all (not necessarily\nsimple) closed curves (see [9], Proposition 3.5).\nIn the case where the surface S has nonempty boundary, Formula (3) does not\ndefine an asymmetric metric on the Teichm\u00fcller space of S. This can easily be seen\nin the case where the surface is a pair of pants P . Denoting by C1 , C2 , C3 the three\nboundary components of the pair of pants, the function K defined on T(P ) \u00d7 T(P )\ntakes the form\nly (Ci )\nK(x, y) = log sup\n.\ni=1,2,3 lx (Ci )\nThis function K on T(P ) satisfies the triangle inequality, but it is not an asymmetric\nmetric, since it can take negative values. Furthermore, it does not separate points;\nthat is, there exist distinct x and y in T(P ) with K(x, y) = 0 (take x and y satisfying\nlx (C1 ) = ly (C1 ), and lx (Ci ) > ly (Ci ) for i = 2, 3).\nIn fact, for any surface S with nonempty boundary, there exist hyperbolic metrics\nX and Y such that K(x, y) < 0 (see [7]).\nWe have K \u2264 L. Indeed, for any k-Lipschitz homeomorphism from a hyperbolic\nmetric x on S to a hyperbolic metric y on S, we easily see that we have, for every\nsimple closed curve \u03b3 on S, ly (f (\u03b3)) \u2264 klx (\u03b3), which implies K(x, y) \u2264 L(x, y).\nThere is a modification of the function K defined in Formula (3) which is adapted\nto the case of surfaces with or without boundary, which we studied in [3] and which\nwe now recall. The definition involves considering essential arcs in S together with\nessential simple closed curves. We call an essential arc in S an embedding of a\nclosed interval, the arc having its endpoints on the boundary of S and its interior\nin the interior of S, and such that this arc is not homotopic relative endpoints to\nan arc contained in \u2202S. In what follows, a homotopy of essential arcs is always\nrelative endpoints.\nIf S is a surface with boundary, we let B = B(S) be the union of the set of\nhomotopy classes of essential arcs in S with the set of homotopy classes of simple\nclosed curves that are homotopic to boundary components. If S is a surface without\nboundary, the set B is assumed to be empty.\nFor any surface S with or without boundary, we consider the function J defined\non T(S) \u00d7 T(S) by\nlY (\u03b3)\nJ(X, Y ) = log sup\nl\n\u03b3\u2208C\u222aB X (\u03b3)\nfor all X, Y \u2208 T(S). If the surface S has no boundary, we recover Thurston's\nasymmetric metric K defined above.\nProposition 4.3. The function J : T(S) \u00d7 T(S) \u2192 R is an asymmetric metric on\nT(S).\nProof. The proof follows from [3], Propositions 2.10 and 2.13.\n\n\u0003\n\nIt is shown in [3], Proposition 2.12, that when S has nonempty boundary, the\nasymmetric metric J can be expressed as the logarithm of the supremum over the\nset B solely.\nIn the same way as for the function K, we easily see that J \u2264 L.\n\n\fLIPSCHITZ MAPS\n\n13\n\n5. Surfaces of finite type\nWe now construct Lipschitz-extremal homeomorphisms between some hyperbolic\npairs of pants, using the homeomorphisms hk between symmetric hyperbolic rightangled hexagons that we constructed in Section 3. We shall then combine these\nhomeomorphisms to get Lipschitz-extremal homeomorphisms of hyperbolic surfaces\nof arbitrary topological finite type.\nWe shall call a hyperbolic pair of pants symmetric if it is obtained by gluing\nalong three non-consecutive boundary components two isometric symmetric rightangled hexagons, and we shall always assume that these hexagons are glued along\ntheir long edges. Thus, the boundary components of our pairs of pants are \"short\".\nWe let P be a symmetric pair of pants obtained by gluing two symmetric rightangled hexagons H, and for every k \u2265 0, we let Pk be a symmetric pair of pants\nobtained by gluing two right-angled hexagons Hk . Taking the double of the map\nhk : H \u2192 Hk produces a map pk : P \u2192 Pk .\nTheorem 5.1. The line t 7\u2192 Pet (t \u2208 R) is a stretch line, and it is a geodesic for\nthese two metrics J and L on T0,3 . Furthermore, up to reparametrization, this line\nis also a geodesic for both metrics when it is traversed in the opposite direction.\nProof. For each t \u2265 0, the action of the homeomorphism P \u2192 Pet on each boundary component of P is linear (it multiplies arc length by et ). The fact that the\nline t 7\u2192 Pet (t \u2208 R) coincides with a stretch line follows from the fact that for all\nt \u2265 0, the surface Pet is obtained from P by multiplying the lengths of the boundary geodesics by the constant factor et , and this factor completely determines the\nresulting hyperbolic surface Pet . This also implies that we have J(P, Pet ) = t. On\nthe other hand, since the map we construct is et -Lipschitz, we have L(P, Pet ) \u2264 t.\nThis, together with the inequality J \u2264 L, gives J(P, Pet ) = L(P, Pet ) for all t \u2265 0.\nThus, the line t 7\u2192 Pet is a geodesic for J and for L.\nFor the proof of the second statement, we first consider the case of hexagons.\nLet H be a symmetric hexagon. Choose three non-consecutive edges as the long\nedges of H. For each k \u2265 1, we have a map hk : H \u2192 Hk , as defined in Section\n3 above, whose Lipschitz constant is k and which expands the long edges of H by\nthe factor k. By exchanging the roles of the long and short edges, we get a map\ngk : Hk \u2192 H which expands the new long edges by a factor dk , and contracts the\nnew short edges by the factor k.\nFrom Formula (1), we deduce that the dilatation factor dk of gk is given by\n1\nargsinh (\n)\nl\n2 sinh L\n=\n(4)\ndk =\n1\nlk\n)\nargsinh (\n2 sinh kL\nThe homeomorphism gk has Lipschitz constant dk and it expands the long edges\nof the hyperbolic hexagon Hk by the factor dk (see Figure 5), therefore we have\nJ(Hk , H) = log dk = L(Hk , H),\nJ(H, Hk ) = log k = L(H, Hk ).\nDoubling the hexagons, we obtain the same result for the symmetric pair of pants,\nshowing that, up to parametrization, the line t 7\u2192 Pet is a geodesic in both directions\nfor the metrics J and L.\n\u0003\nRemark 5.2. By Theorem 5.1, we have J(x, y) = L(x, y) if the points x and y\nare situated on the stretch line that we construct. We do not know whether the\nmetrics J and L are equal on Teichm/\"uller space.\n\n\f14\n\nATHANASE PAPADOPOULOS AND GUILLAUME TH\u00c9RET\n\nA particular hyperbolic surface S of arbitrary finite type (g, b) can be obtained\nby gluing a collection of symmetric pairs of pants in such a way that the feet of the\nseams of adjacent pairs of pants coincide. In such a situation, we shall say that the\ngluing has been done without torsion. For such a surface, we have the following:\nTheorem 5.3. The line t 7\u2192 Set (t \u2208 R) is a stretch line in Tg,b , and it is a geodesic\nfor both asymmetric metrics J and L on Tg,b . Up to reparametrization, this line is\nalso a geodesic for the same metrics when it is traversed in the opposite direction.\nAlong that line, the metrics J and L coincide. Furthermore, this stretch line has\nthe following nice description in the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates associated to the\nunderlying pair of pants decomposition of S: at time t from the origin, all the length\nparameters are multiplied by the constant factor et , and all the twist parameters are\nunchanged and remain equal to zero.\nProof. We start with a symmetric hyperbolic pair of pants P equipped with a complete geodesic lamination, and we then consider the hyperbolic surface S, homeomorphic to S0,4 , obtained by gluing two copies of P along one boundary component,\nin such a way that the following hold:\n\u2022 The union of the complete geodesic laminations of both pairs of pants is a\nnon chain-recurrent complete geodesic lamination of S.\n\u2022 The feet of the seams abutting on the component along which we glue\ncoincide; that is, we glue without torsion. Here, the origin of FenchelNielsen twist coordinates is measured as a signed distance between feets of\nseams (in the universal cover). We refer to [10, Theorem 4.6.23] for the\nconvention on Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates.\nLet us denote by \u03b1 the curve in S that corresponds to the glued components. There\nis an orientation-reversing order-two symmetry exchanging the copies of P in S.\nThe surface S is equipped with a complete geodesic lamination \u03bc, and the order-two\nsymmetry leaves the lamination \u03bc invariant.\nIt is now useful to describe the situation in the universal covering Se of S. The\norder-two symmetry lifts to the universal cover, and the preimage of \u03bc in Se is\nleft invariant by this symmetry. The deformation of the hyperbolic plane by the\nstretch map can be seen in Se as preserving a basepoint O on a lift \u03b1\ne of \u03b1 and\nthe horocycle passsing through O and centerd at the endpoint of \u03b1\ne. The stretch\ndeformation is then described in a neighborhood of \u03b1\ne by replacing the horocycle\nL\n\nkL\nfk\n\nPSfrag replacementsH\nfk\ngk\n\nHk\n\nL\ngk\n\nkL\n\na\n\nFigure 5.

(Recall that the\nlengths of the horocycle pieces are all < 1.) See Figure 6) for a representation\no this stretch deformation. This shows that the stretch deformation commutes\nwith the order-two symmetry. Hence, the feet of the seams coincide all along the\ndeformation of S by the stretch directed by \u03bc. In other words, stretching along \u03bc\ndoes not induce Fenchel-Nielsen torsion. The last statement of the theorem is thus\nestablished. This also shows that the line t 7\u2192 Set is a geodesic for both metrics\nL and J, yielding the equality L = J on that line. We now proceed to show that\nour line traversed in opposite direction is a geodesic for both asymmetric metrics J\nand L and that these two metrics coincide along that line. The homeomorphisms\nget defined on each pair of pants given by the pants decomposition of S piece\ntogether into a homeomorphism we also denote by get from Set to S. The reason\nwhy these local homeomorphisms piece together correctly is the absence of torsion\nalong the components of the pants decomposition. The Lipschitz constant of the\nhomeomorphism get thus obtained is det . The seams of the pairs of pants coalesce\ninto (smooth) geodesic simple closed curves and essential geodesic arcs that are\nstretched by the factor det from Set to S. This shows that the homeomorphism get\nis Lipschitz-minimizing and that L = J on the line. The proof is complete.\n\u0003\nRemark 5.4. The dual metric of an asymmetric metric M on a set X is the\nasymmetric metric defined by M (x, y) = M (y, x) for every x and y in X. Equation\n(4) shows that the asymmetric metric J and its dual metric on T(S) are not quasiisometric, even restricted to our geodesics Set . Indeed, we have seen that for t \u2265 0,\n\nPSfrag replacements\nA\nB\nFigure 6.

These observations naturally lead to the following:\nQuestion 5.5. Characterize the geodesic lines for Thurston's asymmetric metric\nand for its analogue J for surfaces with boundary, such that the restriction on that\nline of such a metric and its dual are quasi-isometric ?\nWe note in this respect that Choi and Rafi showed in [1] that in the thick part\nof Teichm\u00fcller space, Thurston's asymmetric metric and its dual metric are both\nquasi-isometric to Teichm\u00fcller's metric. On the other hand, there exist stretch\nlines that are completely contained in the thick part (take a pseudo-Anosov map\nwhose stable and unstable laminations are complete, and consider the stretch line\ndirected by one of these two laminations and passing by a point whose horocyclic\nfoliation is the other lamination); therefore, there exist stretch lines for Thurston's\nasymmetric metric such that the restriction on that line of this metric and its dual\nare quasi-isometric.\nWe now recall that by a result of Thurston, given any two points x and y in\nTeichm\u00fcller space, there is a unique maximally stretched chain-recurrent geodesic\nlamination \u03bc(x, y) from x to y which is maximal with respect to inclusion, and that\nif x and y lie in that order on a stretch line directed by a complete chain-recurrent\ngeodesic lamination \u03bc, then \u03bc(x, y) = \u03bc. The next theorem identifies this geodesic\nlamination for two points x and y on the same stretch lines we construct, and it\nsays in particular that this lamination is not complete.\nTheorem 5.6. For the stretch lines that we constructed above, the maximal maximally stretched lamination \u03bc(S, Set ) is the pair of pants decomposition that underlines the construction.\nProof. Let t > 0. The maximal maximally stretched chain-recurrent geodesic lamination \u03bc(S, Set ) from S to Set contains the underlying pair of pants decomposition,\nsince each curve in this decomposition is maximally stretched. Assume for contradiction that \u03bc(S, Set ) contains a larger lamination. It then contains a bi-infinite\ngeodesic that spirals around some closed geodesic C in that decomposition. Since\n\u03bc(S, Set ) is chain-recurrent, it contains another geodesic that spirals along the opposite side of C in the same direction (compare Figure 7). By a result in [6],\nif we perform a Thurston stretch along a completion of \u03bc(S, Set ), then we necessarily introduce a Fenchel-Nielsen torsion about the closed geodesic C. Now\nThurston proved in [9] that we can join S to Set by a concatenation of Thurston\nstretches which are directed by complete geodesic laminations, all of them containing \u03bc(S, Set ). The torsions introduced about the geodesic C are all in the same\ndirection. Thus, there necessarily is a nonzero torsion. This contradicts Theorem 5.3. Thus, \u03bc(S, Set ) does not contain any geodesic lamination larger than\nthe geodesics of the pair of pants decomposition. Thus, the maximal maximally\nstretched lamination \u03bc(S, Set ) is the pair of pants decomposition.\n\u0003\n\n\fLIPSCHITZ MAPS\n\n17\n\nIt also follows from the reasoning in the proof of Theorem 5.6 that the set of\nmaximal maximally stretched laminations from S to Set is the set of all completions\nof the pants decomposition that are nowhere chain-recurrent, which means that\nthe geodesics spiralling around each component of the pants decomposition wrap\nin opposite directions, as illustrated in Figure 7.\n\nPSfrag replacements\nhorocycles\nperpendicular\nto the boundary\nhorocyclic arc\nof length one\nnon-foliated\nregion\n\nFigure 7. A non chain-recurrent geodesic lamination. The spirals\nwrap around the closed curve in opposite directions.\n\nRemark 5.7. Given two points x, y in Teichm\u00fcller space and knowing the maximal\nmaximally stretched lamination \u03bc(x, y) from x to y, it is in general quite difficult\nto find the lamination \u03bc(y, x). For all t > 0, the maximal maximally stretched\n\"lamination\" from Set to S is the union of the seams. As already mentioned in\nthe proof of Theorem 5.3, by our choice of the twist parameters (in which the feet\nof the seams coincide), in the case of closed surfaces, the union of the seams is a\nunion of disjoint closed geodesics (a multi-curve), see Figure 8. This multi-curve is\nmaximally stretched by the stretch that we defined from Set to S and therefore it\nis contained in the lamination \u03bc(Set , S). In the case of a closed surface of genus 2,\nthe preceding argument shows that \u03bc(Set , S) is a union of seams, since this union\nis a pants decomposition.\n\nPSfrag replacements\nhorocycles\nperpendicular\nto the boundary\nhorocyclic arc\nof length one\nnon-foliated\nregion\n\nFigure 8.
