INTRODUCTION\n\nAs galaxies form, they accrete gas from infalling objects\nand from the intergalactic medium (IGM). The process of\ngalaxy formation also is apparently not 100% efficient at getting gas into galaxies, as some galaxies are observed to drive\ngalactic winds or outflows, expelling gas, possibly to escape\nthe galaxy itself. The baryonic mass in local disks compared\nto their dark matter halo mass is lower than the global value,\nwhich may point to past episodes of gas removal by outflows\n(e.g. Fukugita, Hogan & Peebles 1998; Mo & Mao 2004;\nDutton et al. 2007). Galactic winds can be driven by stellar\nwinds, supernovae, or active galactic nuclei; observationally,\nin local galaxies winds are a general consequence of high star\nformation rates or star formation surface density (e.g. Lehnert\n& Heckman 1996). Outflows may play a large role in regulating the baryon and metal content of galaxies, and in enriching the intergalactic medium. The frequency of outflows\n1 Steward Observatory, 933 N.

Observations of winds and their\nimplications are discussed in the review by Veilleux, Cecil &\nBland-Hawthorn (2005).\nIn nearby galaxies, strong winds driven by supernovae are\nseen mainly in starbursting dwarfs, starburst galaxies such\nas M82, and luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies\n(LIRGs and ULIRGs); the latter are frequently mergers and\noften host active galactic nuclei (AGN). Winds are often\nfound in galaxies above a SFR surface density threshold of\n\u223c 0.1M\u2299 yr\u22121 kpc\u22122 (Heckman 2002), while large-scale outflows are not seen in local ordinary disk galaxies. The Milky\nWay has a nuclear wind that would not be detectable outside\nthe Local Group (Veilleux et al. 2005). It is not clear whether\na galaxy such as the Milky Way has had a galactic-scale outflow in the past. We do know that the global SFR density was\n\u223c 10\u00d7 higher at z = 1 than today (e.g. Lilly et al. 1996; Hopkins 2004). Noeske et al. (2007a) showed that the higher SFR\nis due to higher rates at z = 1 in starforming galaxies across a\nwide mass range, rather than an increased frequency of starbursts in a fraction of galaxies. It is thus possible that a large\nfraction of the galaxy population drove outflows in the past;\nthat is one question this paper seeks to address.\nThe dependence of outflows on galaxy mass is also of great\ninterest. Larson (1974) showed that supernova-driven winds\ncould heat and eject interstellar gas during galaxy formation,\nand that this process could be more effective in smaller galaxies. The influential theoretical treatment of Dekel & Silk\n(1986) found that winds could remove a significant amount\nof gas from low-mass galaxies, Vvir . 100 km s\u22121 , resolving\n\n\f2\n\nWeiner et al.\n\nseveral issues in cold dark matter galaxy formation. A number of authors have simulated the effect of winds on the ISM,\ne.g. Mac Low & Ferrara (1999). Their simulations suggested\nthat winds do not entirely clear ISM gas except at extremely\nlow masses, but that they are efficient at preferentially ejecting metals. However, other treatments of wind physics suggest that winds in massive galaxies in a high-SFR phase could\nlimit the SFR and eject a substantial amount of gas (Murray,\nQuataert & Thompson 2005). The physical conditions in the\nwind fluid and the mass-loading of cold gas into the hot wind\nare quite difficult to constrain from observations (e.g. Strickland & Stevens 2000; Murray et al. 2005). It remains open\nwhether metals are ejected and the IGM enriched preferentially by low or high mass galaxies, and the degree to which\nAGN-driven winds contribute.\nFossil evidence of the effect of winds comes from studies of the mass-metallicity relation in local samples and in\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey. These studies show that lowmass galaxies have low effective yields, indicating that winds\nhave removed metals from them; the behavior of the effective\nyield is evidence for past winds in galaxies of stellar mass\nM\u2217 < 1010 M\u2299 (Garnett 2002; Tremonti et al. 2004). Dalcanton (2007) showed that star formation after an outflow\nepisode is efficient at returning the measured metal yield to\nits nominal value. Therefore, winds must preferentially carry\naway enriched gas to reduce the yield in low-mass, high gasfraction galaxies. However, because even enriched outflows\nwill not substantially change the observed effective yield in\nhigh-mass galaxies, the observations do not rule out winds at\nhigher masses (Tremonti et al. 2004). The behavior of the\neffective yield does not provide evidence either for or against\npast winds in high mass galaxies.\nDirect evidence for galactic winds in the local universe\ncomes from a variety of observations including X-rays, the\nmorphology and kinematics of interstellar emission lines, and\noutflow kinematics in interstellar absorption lines (Veilleux et\nal. 2005 and references therein). Blueshifted absorption lines\nare the wind signatures that are most straightforward to observe and interpret in distant galaxies, and the method we use\nin this paper.\nIn local galaxies, Phillips (1993) found blueshifted Na I absorption spread across the disk of the starforming galaxy NGC\n1808, associated with extraplanar dust plumes. Blueshifted\nNa I absorption was observed in 12 of 18 infrared-luminous\nstarburst galaxies (Heckman et al. 2000), with outflow velocities of 100\u2013600 km s\u22121 . Further surveys have confirmed that\nblueshifted Na I absorption is common in IR-bright starburst\ngalaxies (Rupke, Veilleux & Sanders 2002, 2005a,b; Martin\n2005, 2006) and is also found in dwarf starbursts (Schwartz\n& Martin 2004). Low-ionization UV lines behave similarly to\nthe Na I lines (Schwartz et al. 2006).\nTremonti, Moustakas & Diamond-Stanic (2007) detected\nblueshifted absorption in Mg II in z \u223c 0.6 very luminous\npost-starburst galaxies. The outflow velocities are very large,\n500-2000 km s\u22121 , leading them to suggest these are relics\nof AGN-driven outflows. Sato et al. (2008) have found\nblueshifted Na I absorption in red-sequence galaxies at z \u223c 0.4\nin the DEEP2 survey; they find a higher frequency of outflows\nat greater infrared luminosity, but also find some outflows in\nquiescent galaxies that show signs of being post-starbursts.\nAt high redshift, z \u223c 3, outflows with typical velocities of\n250 km s\u22121 are found in rapidly starforming galaxies selected\nby the Lyman-break technique. The gravitationally lensed\n\ngalaxy cB58 (Pettini et al. 2000, 2002) and the composite\nspectrum of a large sample of Lyman-break galaxies (Shapley\net al. 2003) show blueshifted outflows in both low- and highionization UV interstellar lines such as Si II and C IV. These\nearly, rapidly starforming galaxies are commonly thought to\nbe progenitors of today's massive ellipticals (e.g. Adelberger\net al. 2005), although this point remains controversial (e.g.\nConroy et al. 2008). At z > 3, Lyman-\u03b1 emitting galaxies\nalso exhibit blueshifted absorption and Ly-\u03b1 red wings that\ncould arise in outflows (Frye et al. 2002; Dawson et al. 2002;\nSawicki et al. 2008). AGN also drive high-velocity outflows\n(e.g. Morganti et al. 2005; Nesvadba et al. 2006; Trump et al.\n2006); these might affect the host galaxy ISM. The increased\nfrequency of AGN and QSOs at high redshift could have a significant effect on subsequent galaxy evolution, although the\nefficiency of coupling an AGN outflow to the galactic ISM is\nnot well understood.\nIn summary, at low redshift we know that galaxies with\nhigh SFR surface density have outflows, and at least some\npost-starbursts also do. At high redshift, galaxies selected by\nmethods that find high SFRs show outflows, but following the\ndestiny of these progenitors to the present day is uncertain.\nIn this work we investigate Mg II absorption in star-forming\ngalaxies with spectra from the DEEP2 redshift survey (Davis\net al. 2003), which reach Mg II at z \u223c 1.4. Mg II absorption\nprobes cool, atomic gas (neutral gas and H II with metals in\nlow ionization states), as does Na I; Mg II has an ionization\npotential of 15.0 eV while Na I is 5.1 eV, so Mg II is less\neasily photodissociated and suffers smaller ionization corrections. The Mg II line has not been used to probe galacticscale or star-formation driven outflows prior to Tremonti et\nal. (2007), mostly due to its location in the near-UV. Mg II\noutflows are seen in a small fraction of Seyfert nuclei (Crenshaw et al. 1999) and in low-ionization broad absorption line\nQSOs (LoBALs, which are \u223c 1% of QSOs; Trump et al.\n2006). Mg II has been used in many studies of QSO absorption systems at intermediate redshift; these show that strong\nMg II systems (EW > 0.3 \u00c5) occur within a few tens of kpc\nof luminous galaxies (e.g. Lanzetta & Bowen 1990; Bergeron\n& Boisse 1991; Steidel, Dickinson & Persson 1994). Possible sources of these Mg II systems include extended rotating\ngas, tidal debris, associated clustered absorption, and outflows\n(e.g. Charlton & Churchill 1998; Steidel et al. 2002; Bouch\u00e9\net al. 2006; Kaprczak et al. 2007; Tinker & Chen 2008; Wild\net al. 2008).\nHere, we use co-added spectra of 1406 galaxies at z =\n1.28 to 1.5 from the DEEP2 survey to detect low-ionization\noutflowing gas in absorption lines of Mg II 2796, 2803 \u00c5\nand Mg I 2852 \u00c5. We find absorption strengths of this lowionization gas comparable to strong Mg II QSO absorption\nsystems. The characteristic outflow velocities are of order\n300\u2013500 km s\u22121 . We use K-band and Spitzer/MIPS 24 \u03bc m\ndata for part of the sample to calibrate stellar mass and star\nformation rate estimates, and explore the dependence of outflows on mass and SFR.\nWe assume a LCDM cosmology with H0 = 70, \u03a9m = 0.3,\nand \u03a9\u039b = 0.7. Magnitudes in this paper are in the AB system unless otherwise noted, and wavelengths at > 2000 \u00c5\nare given in air, although the reduction was done on vacuum\nwavelengths.\nWe describe the sample of galaxies and spectroscopy in\nSection 2. Section 3 presents the composite spectrum and introduces the evidence for outflows in Mg II absorption, while\n\n\fOutflows from Star-Forming Galaxies\nSection 4 analyzes and quantifies the outflow component of\nMg II. In Section 5 we compute restframe properties of the\nhost galaxies and in section 6 we measure the dependence of\noutflows on the host galaxy properties. Section 7 analyzes the\nobservations, including the physical properties of the outflow\nand the implications for wind models, and 8 summarizes the\nconclusions. The key results of the paper are found in Sections 3, 6 and 7.\n2. SAMPLE AND DATA EXTRACTION\n2.1. Spectroscopic data and sample selection\n\nThe sample of galaxies we study is drawn from the\nDEEP2 galaxy redshift survey (Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe 2; Davis et al. 2003). DEEP2 is selected from BRI\nimaging with the CFHT CFH12K camera (Coil et al. 2004b),\nand has obtained redshifts for approximately 32,000 galaxies, using the DEIMOS spectrograph at the Keck II telescope.\nThe DEEP2 sample is distributed across four fields and is selected to have 18.5 < RAB < 24.1. In three of the four fields,\na color selection in B \u2212 R, R \u2212 I is applied to exclude galaxies\nat z < 0.7 (Coil et al. 2004a), which does not affect the highredshift subsample we use in this paper. The fourth field, the\nExtended Groth Strip, allows testing the color selection and\nconfirms that the excluded galaxies are at z < 0.7.\nDEEP2 DEIMOS spectra are taken with a 1200 lines/mm\ngrating and 1.0\u2032\u2032 slit, yielding resolution R \u223c 5000 and a scale\nof 0.33 \u00c5/pixel. A typical DEEP2 spectrum has wavelength\ncoverage \u223c 6600 \u2212 9100 \u00c5; the exact limits vary depending\non the object's location on the slit mask. Galaxy spectra are\nreduced by an automated pipeline, extracted to 1-d in a window that is typically 1.5 times the spatial FWHM of the object\nalong the slit, and processed by an automated template fitter\nto determine a set of candidate redshifts. The program fits a\nlinear combination of an artificial emission-line template containing [O II], H\u03b2 , [O III], and H\u03b1 , and an early type galaxy\ntemplate derived from the SDSS Luminous Red Galaxy sample (Eisenstein et al. 2001), shifting the templates relative to\nthe spectrum and computing \u03c7 2 . It finds minima in \u03c7 2 and\nnominates these as candidate redshifts. The program also attempts to fit stellar and QSO templates.\nEach spectrum is then examined by a member of the DEEP2\nteam to select the correct redshift or reject the redshift as unconfirmed. To be accepted as a confirmed redshift, a galaxy\nmust show at least two spectral features. The DEIMOS spectra resolve the [O II] \u03bb \u03bb 3726, 3729 \u00c5 doublet and a detection of both lines counts as two features. For galaxies at\n0.8 < z < 1.5, [O II] emission is the primary redshift indicator\nin DEEP2. Beyond z \u223c 1.5, [O II] is increasingly difficult to\ndetect in the OH airglow line forest, so the DEEP2 wavelength\nrange was chosen to only extend as far as [O II] at z = 1.5.\nTo study the properties of the Mg II near-UV absorption doublet at \u03bb \u03bb 2795.53, 2802.71 \u00c5, we selected DEEP2\nspectra of confirmed galaxies that have wavelength coverage\nreaching to 2788.7 \u00c5 in the restframe (\u2013730, \u20131500 km/sec\nrelative to Mg II 2795.53, 2802.71 \u00c5), or bluer. The limited\nwavelength coverage of DEEP2 spectra and the requirement\nof [O II] to measure an accurate redshift mean that this sample is limited to galaxies at the highest redshifts in DEEP2,\nz \u223c 1.4, where [O II] is detected and Mg II is in the DEEP2\nspectrum. At z = 1.4, Mg II is observed at \u223c 6720 \u00c5 and\n[O II] is at \u223c 8950 \u00c5. Bluer UV absorption lines such as Fe II\nor C IV cannot be measured with these data. A small number\n\n3\n\nof objects with z > 1.5 also meet the wavelength coverage criterion, but objects with z > 1.5 in DEEP2 are generally QSOs\nidentified by UV emission, so we excluded all objects with\nz > 1.5.\nFrom a catalog with 32,308 confirmed galaxy and QSO redshifts, these criteria select 1409 unique objects at z < 1.5.\nThree are AGN/QSOs with strong broad Mg II emission,\nidentified in the DEEP2 catalog as CLASS=AGN, and we exclude them. The 1406 galaxies are hereafter called the Mg\nII sample. 31 of the galaxies were observed twice, and we\nused only the first observation. All 1406 galaxies have broadband BRI magnitudes from the CFHT CFH12K observations.\nThe median redshift of the 1406-galaxy sample is 1.379 and\nthe 5%-95% range is 1.314 \u2013 1.451. The DEEP2 survey is\nselected at R-band, so at z \u223c 1.4 it is effectively selected at\nrestframe 2800 \u00c5. Therefore the sample strongly favors starforming galaxies in the \"blue cloud\" of the bimodal galaxy\ncolor-magnitude diagram (Weiner et al. 2005; Willmer et al.\n2006).\nFrom comparing the measurements of 1453 galaxies in the\nentire DEEP2 sample that were observed twice, the errors\non a single redshift measurement are \u03c3 (z) = 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22124 and\n5.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 at 68% and 95% probability respectively. The errors on relative velocity are \u03c3 (v) = c\u03c3 (z)/(1 + z), yielding 16\nand 68 km s\u22121 at 68% and 95%, at z = 1.4. In this paper, we\nare concerned with the velocity of Mg II relative to a systemic\nvelocity measured at [O II]. Since these are at the extreme\nblue and red ends of the DEEP2 spectrum, the relative velocity requires a good global wavelength calibration. We tested\nthis empirically by comparing the relative velocities of [O II]\n3727 and [O III] 5007 for galaxies with both lines, at z \u223c 0.8\nwhere they are at blue and red ends of the DEEP2 spectrum.\nIn 3772 galaxies, the median offset is 0.9 km s\u22121 and the 68%\nand 95% ranges are \u00b136 and \u00b1169 km s\u22121 respectively. Outliers are caused in part by errors in the emission line fitting\ndue to sky residuals and weak-emission objects, so the actual wavelength scale is better. These 1\u03c3 redshift and wavelength accuracies are considerably smaller than the few hundred km s\u22121 outflow offsets we show to be typical in the Mg\nII sample.\n2.2. Co-addition of DEEP2 spectra\nThe median signal to noise of DEEP2 spectra in the Mg II\nsample near 2820 \u00c5 restframe is 0.55 per pixel, or 1.1 per\nFWHM. The typical exposure time of 1 hour is designed for\nacceptable detection of nebular emission lines, but does not\nyield S/N/pixel high enough to study absorption lines in detail\nin most of the objects. We construct a high S/N composite by\nco-adding spectra in their rest frame.\nWe co-add the spectra using an IDL routine written by\nmembers of the DEEP2 team. From an input catalog of\nDEEP2 galaxies, the routine collects their 1-D extracted spectra, corrects each for telluric absorption, shifts the wavelength\nscale to the rest frame based on the DEEP2 catalog redshift,\nwhich is derived from [O II] in these objects, and coadds the\nspectra, weighting at each pixel by the inverse variance.\nWeighting solely by the inverse variance would mean that\nbright objects contribute super-linearly to the coadd, since\nthey have higher flux and lower variance. For the present sample, for each spectrum we renormalized the inverse variance\narray so that it has median of 1, prior to the telluric correction.\nThe effect is to retain the dependence of the inverse variance\non wavelength in each individual spectrum, e.g. due to night\n\n\f4\n\nWeiner et al.\n\nF IG . 2.- The coadded spectrum of all 1406 galaxies in the Mg II sample, in the rest frame.

The coadded spectrum is light-weighted, not\nequal-number-weighted, across the galaxy sample. We did\nnot flux-calibrate the spectra prior to coaddition; since the\ngalaxies occupy a narrow redshift range, the instrumental response does not vary greatly in the pixels contributing to a\ngiven rest wavelength. The pixel spacing in the coadded spectrum is 13.8 km s\u22121 at 2800 \u00c5. The S/N/pixel in the coadded\nspectrum of 1406 galaxies is 21, and in the subsamples of\nSection 6 the S/N/pixel is 8 to 14.\n3. MG II ABSORPTION IN DEEP2 GALAXIES\n3.1. The coadded spectrum at z = 1.4\nFigure 2 shows the full coadded spectrum of the 1406galaxy Mg II sample. The spectrum is dominated by strong\n[O II] 3727 emission. There are prominent Balmer absorption lines indicating a young stellar population with A stars,\n[Ne III] 3869 emission, and some narrow Balmer emission.\nThe UV spectrum blueward of [O II] is relatively featureless\nexcept for weak He I 3188 \u00c5 emission, and strong absorption\nfrom Mg I at 2852 \u00c5 and the Mg II doublet at 2796, 2803 \u00c5.\nIn Figure 3 we extract the regions of the co-added spectrum around the lines [O II] 3726.0, 3728.8 \u00c5, Mg II 2795.5,\n2802.7 \u00c5, and Mg I 2852.1 \u00c5, and plot them on restframe\nvelocity scales derived from the DEEP2 catalog redshift. At\nthis high redshift, the DEEP2 redshift is based solely on fitting [O II]. The [O II] doublet is thus necessarily fixed to zero\nvelocity, here referenced to the redder line at 3728.82 \u00c5. The\nimmediately visible result is that the Mg II and Mg I absorption lines are asymmetric and blueshifted by a few hundred\nkm s\u22121 with respect to the systemic velocity defined by [O II].\nThe lines of the [O II] doublet are symmetric, with lowintensity wings more extended than Gaussian. The wings\n\nF IG . 3.- The [O II ] 3726.0, 3728.8, Mg II 2795.5, 2802.7, and Mg I 2852.1\n\u00c5 lines in the coadded spectrum of 1406 galaxies, relative to zero velocity as\ndefined by the redshift derived from [O II ]. The [O II ] doublet lines are at\ntheir nominal systemic velocities, but the Mg I and both Mg II lines show\nblueshifted and asymmetric absorption profiles. The horizontal bars in the\nmiddle panel show the extent of the windows used in Section 3.4 to measure\nabsorption and excess emission in individual spectra.\n\ncould be due to wings in individual galaxies or simply the\nfact that the summation of Gaussians of different dispersions\nis not itself a Gaussian. In local superwind galaxies, faint\noptical emission is seen from high-velocity wings of a few\nhundred km s\u22121 , from shocked gas swept up by the wind (e.g.\nBland & Tully 1988; Heckman et al. 1990). The [Ne III] line,\nwhich arises in AGN and in very blue starforming galaxies,\n\n\fOutflows from Star-Forming Galaxies\nis much weaker than [O II], and has a small blueshift of 40\nkm s\u22121 .\nIn local luminous infrared and starburst galaxies, the centroid of optical emission can be slightly blueshifted with respect to the systemic velocity, presumably due to emission\nfrom outflowing gas. For IR-luminous galaxies, Mirabel\n& Sanders (1988), found the optical catalog redshift was\nblueshifted by 90 km s\u22121 on average relative to the centroid\nof 21 cm H I emission. In local edge-on starbursts, Lehnert &\nHeckman (1996) found the nuclear emission lines blueshifted\nby a median of 25 km s\u22121 relative to the overall rotation curve.\nHowever, in our spectra, since the galaxies are comparable in\nsize to the slit width, [O II] emission is integrated over most\nof the galaxy. In our coadded spectrum, the velocity of [O II]\nand the high order Balmer lines at 3798, 3835, and 3889 \u00c5\nagree well. However, centroiding the broad Balmer stellar absorption lines is difficult due to narrow Balmer emission. We\ncoadded spectra of all DEEP2 blue galaxies at 1.1 < z < 1.5\nto reach the Ca II 3933.7 stellar absorption line, and found a\nnegligible offset of < 5 km s\u22121 between Ca II and [O II].12\nThus the [O II]-derived redshift is a reliable measure of the\nsystemic velocity.\nThe Mg II absorption profiles in the middle panel of Figure\n3 are strikingly offset from the systemic velocity. Both lines\nof the Mg II doublet show an asymmetric, blueshifted absorption trough. There is a small amount of absorption redward\nof systemic to +100 km s\u22121 , a deep trough reaching \u223c 60%\nabsorption at a blueshift of \u2013100 km s\u22121 , and a asymmetric,\ntriangular \"sawtooth\" absorption profile extending blueward\nbeyond \u2212500 km s\u22121 . The Mg I line shows a similar profile,\nalthough the depth of absorption is weaker. In the coadded\nspectrum of the 1406-galaxy sample, the equivalent width of\nMg II 2796+2803 absorption is 4.6 \u00c5, and of Mg I 2853 absorption is 0.9 \u00c5.\nBetween the two Mg II lines, there is a hint that the spectrum goes higher than continuum, at \u223c \u2212600 km s\u22121 , or\n\u223c +170 km s\u22121 relative to the Mg II 2796 line. We study\nthis signature in more detail in Section 3.5, where it is shown\nto be strong in a small fraction of the sample and due to Mg\nII emission, most probably from narrow-line AGN.\nThe velocity offset of Mg II is far greater than the uncertainties in the DEEP2 wavelength scale, as discussed in Section 2.\nAdditionally, the velocity spread of the absorption is greater\nthan the velocity width of the galaxy emission lines, and the\nasymmetric absorption profile could not arise from calibration\nerrors. Both the blueshift and the asymmetric profile are real\nproperties of the sum of UV emission over the 1406 galaxies.\n3.2. The cause of blueshifted absorption\n\nThe strong blueshifted absorption shown in Figure 3 is the\nchief observational result of this paper. It indicates the presence of a significant amount of gas in front of and flowing\naway from the continuum source at several hundred km s\u22121\nin both Mg II and Mg I, which are low-ionization lines that\narise in cool gas. Here we discuss the physical interpretation\nof this outflow.\nThe DEEP2 z \u223c 1.4 galaxies are small in apparent size; in\nthe subset with HST imaging, 95% have re f f < 0.95\u2032\u2032 . They\n12 Outflows are rarely seen in Ca II H and K lines in DEEP2, due to\nstronger stellar absorption, lower abundance than Mg, greater depletion onto\ndust, and a large ionization correction for Ca II. Similar factors make Ca II\nrare in QSO absorption line systems (Bowen et al. 1991; Wild et al. 2006).\n\n5\n\nare observed with a 1\u2032\u2032 slit and the seeing smooths over the\ngalaxy light distribution, so that the continuum in the spectra\nis the integrated light of the galaxy. Because the absorption\nreaches > 50% depth, the absorbing material must be spread\nover the galaxy, rather than, for example, being confined to a\nnucleus that does not dominate the integrated light.\n3.2.1. Circumstellar versus galactic-scale absorption\n\nFirst we ask whether the absorption is galactic-scale or circumstellar. Hot stars often show ionized outflows in highionization lines such as C IV, but do not show outflows in lowionization lines. Stellar Mg II absorption is weak in luminous,\nhot O and B stars (Lamers et al. 1973; Lamers & Snijders\n1975; Kondo et al. 1975). Strong and sometimes blueshifted\nabsorption is found in A type supergiants (Praderie et al.\n1980; Verdugo et al. 1999). The very brightest and rarest\nlate B, A, and F stars can have asymmetric or blueshifted absorption of order -100 km/s, but fainter stars do not (Snow et\nal. 1994). Outflows in Mg II are sufficiently infrequent that\nthey should not dominate the integrated light of a star-forming\nstellar population, and the known stellar outflows are lower\nvelocity than observed in the stacked galaxy spectrum.\nThe firmest evidence that the outflows seen in DEEP2 are\ngalactic-scale rather than circumstellar comes from the similarity of the Mg II and Mg I outflow profiles. Mg I 2852 is\nabsent in hot stars, present in F stars, but is photospheric and\ndoes not show signatures of mass loss (Snow et al. 1994). Circumstellar outflows cannot contribute to the outflow signature\nin Mg I.\nPhotospheric, non-outflowing Mg II absorption is weak in\nvery blue stars and stronger in cooler stars (e.g. RodriguezMerino et al. 2005). Some of the zero or low-velocity Mg II\nabsorption could be stellar, but this cannot account for the\nhigh-velocity blueshifted absorption.\n3.2.2. Clustering of intervening absorbers\n\nIntervening Mg II absorption line systems seen against\nQSOs are known to be associated with normal, relatively luminous galaxies, out to impact parameter \u223c 50 kpc, and to be\nclustered similarly to luminous galaxies (e.g. Steidel & Sargent 1992; Steidel et al. 1994; Bouch'e et al. 2006; Wild et al.\n2008). \"Strong\" Mg II absorbers (EW> 0.3\u00c5) have average\nEW of order W2796 \u223c 1\u00c5 and abundance dN/dz \u223c 1 (Nestor\net al. 2005). One could imagine that absorbers that are not directly associated with the source galaxy, but clustered around\nit, would produce a blueshifted absorption signature, tailing\noff to more negative velocities. In this picture the absorption\nvelocity would not represent an outflow but simply the location of the clustered absorbers in the Hubble flow.\nHowever, the absorption strength that could plausibly be\nproduced by nearby clustered absorbers is much lower than\nwe observe. There are a variety of ways of estimating this,\nwhich rely on the frequency of intervening absorbers dN/dz,\ntheir similar clustering to luminous galaxies, and/or that they\nare associated with luminous galaxies.\nFor example, consider absorbers clustered around galaxies\nwith \u03be (r) = (r/r0 )\u2212\u03b3 , r0 = 4h\u22121 Mpc comoving, \u03b3 = 1.8, similar to galaxies and to absorbers clustered around QSOs (Steidel et al. 1994; Coil et al. 2004a; Bouch\u00e9 et al. 2006; Wild\net al. 2008). At z=1.4, r0 corresponds to \u2206z = 0.0029, or 870\nkm s\u22121 in our spectrum. Thus absorbers within r0 could contribute to the observed absorption. From integrating \u03be (r), the\noverdensity within r0 is \u03b4 = 10.5. The expected strength of\n\n\f6\n\nWeiner et al.\n\nthe absorption is roughly Wclust = \u03b4 \u2206z dN/dz < Wabsorber >.\nFrom the survey of Nestor et al. (2005), the frequency of absorbers with Wrest,2796 > 0.3 \u00c5at z = 1.4 is dN/dz = 1.22, and\nintegrating over the equivalent width distribution yields the\nmean < Wabsorber >= 1.07 \u00c5. The predicted absorption EW\nfrom clustering is then Wclust = 0.04 \u00c5, a factor of \u223c 40 fewer\nthan we observe (Table 1). Essentially, the overdensity within\nr0 is not enough to overcome the short pathlength within r0 ,\nsince dN/dz \u223c 1.\nAnother way of looking at this problem is that strong intervening Mg II absorbers are associated with luminous galaxies\nor QSO hosts with impact parameters \u223c 50 kpc (e.g. Steidel\net al. 1994; Hennawi et al. 2006; Chen & Tinker 2008) with\na high, but not 100%, covering factor. The absorption EW\nwe observe is \u223c 1.5\u00d7 the mean of strong Mg II absorbers,\n< Wabsorber >. To produce the absorption we observe by intervening galaxies, every source galaxy would have to have\n\u223c 1.5 interveners, with 100% covering factors, projected at\n< 50 kpc impact parameter and in front by . 800 km s\u22121 .\nThis radius and velocity separation is fairly close to the definition of a close pair, but the fraction of galaxies in close pairs\nin the DEEP2 sample is only 10% (Lin et al. 2004).\n3.2.3. Absorption depth and covering factor\n\nBecause the Mg II absorption in Figure 3 is deep, 55% absorption at the bottom of the trough, we know that it covers a\nlarge fraction of the UV light over the whole sample of galaxies. It may cover \u223c 55% of the stars in all the galaxies, or\nall the stars in \u223c 55% of the galaxies, or some compromise.\nThis also helps to confirm that it is from a galactic-scale outflow, rather than from circumstellar outflows associated with\na particular type of star, or outflows that are local to an active\nnucleus.\nWinds in local starburst disks are more commonly detected\nin face-on galaxies (Heckman et al. 2000). The frequency of\nwind detection in Na I absorption suggests that the angular\ncovering fraction C\u03a9 of their winds, due to the wind opening\nangle, is about 0.4-0.5 in starbursts and LIRGs, and higher\nin ULIRGs (Rupke et al. 2005b). For LIRGs and ULIRGs\nthat do have detected winds, Rupke et al. found a clumpiness\ncovering fraction within the wind of C f \u223c 0.4. For a coadded\nsample of galaxies that all have optically thick winds, the absorption depth is C\u03a9C f , which would be \u223c 0.2 in the Rupke et\nal. sample. An absorption trough depth of 55% is thus quite\nlarge compared to the local values, suggesting that winds are\nactually happening in all of the DEEP2 sample galaxies and\nthat the covering fractions are higher than observed locally in\nNa I.\nAdditionally, the Mg I outflow line is not as deep as the\nMg II outflow, even though Mg I has a higher oscillator\nstrength and Mg II is saturated. The most likely explanation\nis that Mg I has a lower covering fraction, and presumably\ntraces denser or cooler parts of the outflow.\nAlthough the blueshifted absorption is from interstellar gas,\nit is possible that some of the zero-velocity absorption is\ndue to stellar photospheric lines. Separating stellar and ISM\ncontributions typically requires modeling the spectra of starforming populations with a code such as Starburst99 (Leitherer et al. 1999), but we cannot use it to predict the Mg II\nline profiles because Starburst99 does not produce high resolution spectra at 2800 \u00c5. Currently, Starburst99, PEGASE\n(Fioc & Rocca-Volmerange 1997), and the models of Bruzual\n& Charlot (2003) are all limited to resolutions \u223c 10 \u00c5 at 2800\n\n\u00c5, which limits our ability to model the Mg II line profiles or\nEW expected from given stellar populations. However, we\ncan decompose the absorption into velocity components to\nseparate the outflow and zero-velocity, non-outflowing components (Section 4).\n3.2.4. The possibility of AGN-driven outflows\n\nActive galactic nuclei are known to drive winds and to\nsometimes show blueshifted absorption outflow signatures\n(e.g. Crenshaw et al. 1999; Veilleux et al. 2005; Trump et\nal. 2006; Wild et al. 2008). AGN outflows in Mg II are seen\nin low-ionization BAL QSOs, which are a few percent of all\nQSOs (Trump et al. 2006), and in 1 of 17 Seyfert nuclei studied by Crenshaw et al. (1999). AGN/starburst composite IRluminous galaxies often show low-ionization outflows traced\nby Na I (Rupke et al. 2005c). There are signs that the Na I\noutflows in AGN/starburst composites are different on average from those in starburst IR-luminous galaxies, with lower\nopening angle and higher velocity. However, the AGN does\nnot dominate the large scale outflow in these galaxies (Rupke\net al. 2005c).\nThe high frequency and covering fraction of absorption\nin the DEEP2 galaxy sample suggests that the outflows are\ndriven by star formation rather than AGN. Nearly all blue\ncloud galaxies are star-forming, while luminous AGN are\nmuch rarer than 50% and are not common in blue star-forming\ngalaxies at z \u223c 0.8 \u2212 1, as measured by X-ray or emission\nline signatures; AGN signatures are more often seen in red\nor intermediate-color galaxies (Nandra et al. 2007; Weiner et\nal. 2007). Further, Mg II absorption occurs in just a few percent of AGN, as described above. Some of the galaxies in our\nsample may have AGN producing Mg II emission, discussed\nin Section 3.5, but this does not appear to be correlated with\nthe galactic-scale Mg II absorption.\n3.3. Absorption detected in individual spectra\n\nWe examined the individual spectra in the 1406-galaxy\nsample at the location of Mg II. Figure 4 shows six illustrative\nspectra. The top five panels have relatively high S/N; the top\nthree panels show blueshifted Mg II absorption, and panels 4\nand 5 show narrow Mg II emission. Many of the spectra do\nnot have a high S/N in the continuum and we neither detect\nnor rule out Mg II absorption. The lowest panel of Figure 4\nshows one such typical spectrum. As discussed in Section 3.4,\nin the aggregate, these spectra do show Mg II absorption.\nAbout 5-10% of the individual spectra are high enough S/N\nto show convincing Mg II absorption. When it is seen, it is\nalmost always blueshifted. The top three panels of Figure 4\nshow examples of blueshifted absorption; the third object has\nespecially strong absorption. Note that the individual galaxies have asymmetric sawtooth absorption profiles just as the\ncoadded spectrum in Figure 3 does - there is a long tail to\nhigh velocities. The sawtooth profile is a property of individual winds, not just caused by the coadding process.\nAbout 4% of the individual spectra show fairly narrow\nMg II emission lines, as seen in panels 4 and 5 of Figure\n4. This is not characteristic of star formation and probably\ncomes from Seyfert nuclei or other narrow-line AGN. The\nMg II emission is generally at the systemic velocity. The\nemission is sometimes accompanied by detectable blueshifted\nabsorption, but less than 50% of emission objects have individually detectable absorption. In Section 3.5 we discuss the\nproperties of these excess-emission objects.\n\n\fOutflows from Star-Forming Galaxies\n\n7\n\nF IG . 4.- DEIMOS spectra of six galaxies in the Mg II sample in the rest frame.

The top three illustrate the \u223c 5 \u2212 10% of the sample that clearly show blueshifted\nabsorption in individual spectra, with a broad asymmetric profile. Spectra 4 and 5 show narrow Mg II emission at the systemic velocity, visible in \u223c 5% of the\nspectra, presumably due to narrow-line AGN. The spectrum in the bottom panel is more typical of the majority of the sample, where Mg II is neither individually\ndetected nor ruled out. The units of the spectra are e-/hour and the typical noise is 40-50 e-/hour/pixel before smoothing.\n\n\f8\n\nWeiner et al.\n\nF IG . 5.- Flux decrement blueward of Mg II 2803 in individual galaxies.\nThe error cross shows the median error bar.

Galaxies with excess Mg II emission\n\nIn any coadded spectrum or stacked image detection, one\nhas to ask if a feature is a general property of the sample or is\ncaused by a small fraction of outlier objects, and if the feature\nis weighted more or less to brighter objects. This is a less\nsevere problem for absorption than for emission lines, but is\nstill of interest.\nEach individual DEEP2 galaxy spectrum has low S/N/pixel\nat 2800 \u00c5. To address the effect of stacking, for each spectrum\nwe compute the average pixel value and its error estimate in\nthree windows relative to the Mg II 2802.7 line: (1) +400 to\n+800 km s\u22121 , (2) \u2013150 to \u201350 km s\u22121 , and (3) \u2013700 to \u2013600\nkm s\u22121 . Window 1 measures the continuum level, window 2\nis located at the deepest part of the blueshifted Mg II 2802.7\nabsorption, and window 3 is at the high point between the\ntwo Mg II lines, where there may be excess emission above\ncontinuum. The locations of these windows are shown in the\nmiddle panel of Figure 3.\nFigure 5 compares the average flux in the continuum window 1 and the absorption window 2. There is considerable\nscatter, as expected given the median errorbar, but the entire distribution of points is shifted below the 1:1 line. The\nblueshifted absorption is a phenomenon that occurs throughout the z = 1.4 galaxy sample, not in just a small subset.\nFigure 6 compares the average flux in the continuum window 1 and the excess emission window 3, between the Mg II\nabsorption lines. The behavior here is rather different than in\nFigure 5. The bulk of galaxies scatter around the 1:1 line; they\nare roughly at the continuum level in window 3. However, a\nsmall number of galaxies show significant excess emission in\nwindow 3. These are relatively bright and so contribute to the\nlight-weighted coadded spectrum. We discuss these unusual\nobjects in the next section.\n\nWe define the \"excess emission sample\" as the tail of 50\nobjects with flux(window 3)> 110 DN/pixel and flux(window\n3)>flux(window 1). These galaxies tend to be in the bluer\nhalf of the sample and brighter than average, as shown in the\nmagnitude-color diagram of Figure 7.\nFigure 8 shows the coadded spectra of the 1356 galaxies\nwithout excess emission and the 50 galaxies with it (lower\npanel). When these 50 galaxies are coadded, they show a clear\nsignature of emission around +100 km s\u22121 relative to 2795.5\n\u00c5 and at +100 km s\u22121 relative to 2802.7 \u00c5. In the \"no-excess\nemission\" sample (middle panel of Figure 8), the spectrum\nas observed does not have an excess above continuum, but\nmodeling the red wings of the two Mg II lines suggests a small\nexcess, discussed further in Section 4.\nOn examining the individual spectra in the excess-emission\ngalaxies, a number of them show relatively weak Mg II emission lines with FWHM \u223c 150 to 300 km s\u22121 , in which the\ndoublet is resolved. This Mg II emission is weaker and narrower than the broad Mg II of QSOs, and is probably from\nSeyfert nuclei (e.g. Wu, Boggess & Gull 1983). Another\npossibility is redshifted emission from the back side of the\nwind; this has been observed locally in the Na I line in the\ngalactic wind of NGC 1808 (Phillips 1993). Chromospheric\nMg II emission from stars is unlikely to be the cause, especially since it is less strong in hot stars (e.g. Snow et al. 1994),\nand the emission we see is stronger in bluer galaxies.\nSome of the excess-emission spectra also show Mg II absorption, near systemic velocity or blueshifted by a few hundred km s\u22121 . At first glance the composite spectrum in the\nlower panel of Figure 8 resembles the redshifted emission in\nP Cygni absorption/emission profiles, but the emission in individual spectra is generally near the systemic velocity.

Galaxies with excess Mg II emission above\ncontinuum are plotted as large open triangles. The emission is likely from\nnarrow-line AGN and the objects are among the brighter of blue galaxies.\n\nobjects in the excess-emission sample do not have a P Cygni\nprofile, but in the coadded spectrum, the overall blueshifted\nabsorption eats away at the Seyfert emission lines.\nIn the lower panel of Figure 8, the emission peak of the\nMg II 2795.5 line is higher, and the continuum is not flat,\nshowing \"shoulders\" out to \u223c 600 km s\u22121 away from the\nMg II lines. The bluer Mg II line has a higher g-factor and\nshould be stronger. More exotically, it is also possible that the\nline contains some weak broad Mg II AGN emission, which is\nthen partially absorbed by blueshifted gas, leaving a trace of\nasymmetry and the broad continuum shoulders. We searched\nfor Ne V AGN emission at 3425 \u00c5 but did not detect any in\ncoadds of either the excess or no-excess spectra.\nIf the Mg II emission is from AGN, it is not clear why it\nis strongest in the bluest and lower-mass subsample. Some\nAGN light might be contributing to the galaxy color and luminosity. The emission might also be redshifted from the far,\nreceding side of the wind, as in P Cygni profiles. Blueshifted\nabsorption and redshifted emission is seen in the Na I D line\nin the wind of the star-forming galaxy NGC 1808 (Phillips\n1993), where the wind is found across the disk and is due to\nstar formation rather than nuclear activity. However, it is not\nclear why back side emission would be stronger in the bluer\ngalaxies. Bluer, lower-mass galaxies might have less internal\nextinction so that it is easier to see the back side of the wind.\nBut this does not appear to explain the individual Mg II lines\nthat are at the systemic velocity. Interpretations of the emission are hampered by the lack of moderate-resolution Mg II\nspectra in local galaxies to use as a comparison.\nThe excess-emission sample appears to contain relatively\nfaint narrow-line AGN, some detected in individual spectra\nin Mg II emission, and possibly low-level broad-line AGN,\nor back-side wind emission. However, the strength of blueshifted absorption is similar between the composite of this\n\nF IG . 8.- Absorption profiles for: Mg I 2852 \u00c5 for 1356 galaxies without\nexcess Mg II emission (upper panel); Mg II 2796, 2803 \u00c5 for the same 1356\ngalaxies (middle panel); and 50 galaxies with excess Mg II emission between\nthe two absorption lines (lower panel). The colored lines in the middle and\nupper panels show decompositions into continuum (green straight line), symmetric absorption (red gaussians) and outflow absorption (blue), discussed\nbelow in Section 4. The horizontal black line near zero is the error array for\nthe coadded spectrum.\n\nsample and of the remaining 1356 galaxies: the outflow component seems to be independent of the presence of the AGN.\nBecause the excess-emission galaxies have a distinctly different spectral shape and the underlying emission makes it\nharder to measure the properties of the absorption, we exclude\nthem from the discussion of Section 6 where we measure the\ndependence of the absorption on galaxy properties. When the\nremaining 1356 galaxies are analyzed, we do see some residual emission, especially in the bluer galaxies; see Section 4.\n4. INTRINSIC AND OUTFLOW ABSORPTION\n\nThe spectra shown in Figure 3 show Mg I and Mg II absorption that is asymmetric but with both blue and red-shifted\nabsorption. We propose a simple model to decompose the\nabsorption into two physically meaningful components: intrinsic and outflow.\n4.1. Decomposition into symmetric and blueshifted\n\nabsorption\nIn composite spectra, we cannot hope to resolve individual\nabsorption systems. We aim to differentiate intrinsic absorption within the galaxy at the systemic velocity from outflow\nabsorption at negative velocities. The task is complicated by\n\n\f10\n\nWeiner et al.\n\nthe fact that Mg II is a doublet. Our approach is to measure\nthe absorption at systemic velocities from the red side of the\nredder Mg II line and the outflow in the blue side of the bluer\nline. A main goal of this decomposition is to avoid counting\nintrinsic absorption in the wind opacity; the results on outflows are not very sensitive to the details of the method.\nSuppose that a spectrum is produced by a galaxy with a\nmix of UV-emitting stars and gas with some velocity dispersion or rotation, and surrounded by a wind of outflowing material. The actual line-of-sight velocity of the galactic ISM\nabsorption will depend on the geometry of the galaxy, but\nwhen a large number of spectra are coadded, this should average out, so that absorption due to galactic gas will have\nroughly zero mean velocity and the average velocity spread\nof the coadded galaxies. Stellar photospheric absorption will\nhave a zero mean velocity and width governed by the stellar\natmospheres. The intrinsic ISM+stars component should be\nsymmetric about zero velocity, and its red wing can produce\nthe positive-velocity absorption.\nIn principle, inflow of gas accreting onto the galaxy could\nalso contribute to the red wing. However, infalling gas whose\nkinematics are governed by gravitation will be at velocities of\norder the virial velocity dispersion of the halo, and it is very\ndifficult, even if gas is detected, to separate inflow from any\nother gas associated with the galaxy. In contrast, outflowing\ngas with kinematics set by star formation or AGN can be distinguished.\nOutflowing gas that lies between the UV source and us will\nabsorb at blueshifted, negative velocities. This gas could have\nsome velocity dispersion, but it should be fairly small in cool\ngas (e.g. Rupke et al. 2005a). To determine properties of\nthe outflowing component, we attempt to separate it from the\nintrinsic component. We adopt the model:\nFobs (\u03bb ) = CFem (1 \u2212 Asym)(1 \u2212 A f low ),\n\n(1)\n\nAsym (\u03bb ) = A1 G(v, \u03bb1 , \u03c3 ) + A2G(v, \u03bb2 , \u03c3 )\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Fobs(\u03bb ) is the observed flux density, C(\u03bb ) is the underlying linear fit to the continuum of the galaxy, Fem (\u03bb ) describes any variation in the emission beyond the linear continuum slope, and Asym and A f low are the depths of the intrinsic\n(symmetric) and outflow (blueshifted) absorption. We model\nthe symmetric absorption as the product of two Gaussians\nG(v) centered on the wavelengths \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 of the two Mg II\nlines, with velocity dispersion \u03c3 and intensities A1 , A2 .\nThe result of this model is illustrated in the middle panel\nof Figure 8. The heavy black line is the observed spectrum; the green straight line is the continuum fit, the red\ndouble Gaussian absorption lines are the symmetric component Asym = A1 G(2796) + A2G(2803), and the blue line is the\noutflow component 1 \u2212 A f low that remains after the observed\nspectrum is multiplied back by 1 \u2212 Asym .\nThe relative intensities of the absorption in the two lines\ndepend on the balance between optical depth and covering\nfactor.13 For the Mg II doublet, the g-value of the bluer line\nand its oscillator strength are twice as large, so in optically\nthin absorption the bluer line is twice as strong, while in optically thick absorption the strengths are equal. The Mg II\n13 For individual absorption systems, one must also consider the possibility that spectrograph resolution dilutes unresolved but saturated lines. Our\nmeasurements are of an ensemble of coadded absorbers, and the ensemble is\nresolved though individual clouds are not.\n\ntransition becomes optically thick at a low column density\n(NMgII & 1013 atoms cm\u22122 , or NH > 1018 for solar abundance), so it is generally saturated in cool gas and in stars. In\nour spectra the depths of the Mg II lines appear equal, so we\nset A1 = A2 , implying saturated absorption in the symmetric\ncomponent.\nDecomposing the symmetric and blueshifted components\ncan be awkward due to the doublet. We infer the properties of\nthe symmetric components from the red side of the red line.\nBy assuming symmetry, we can determine how much of the\nabsorption at negative velocities is actually due to the symmetric component. We assume the strengths of the two Mg II\nlines are equal to infer the symmetric component of the bluer\nline.\nThe upper two panels of Figure 8 illustrate the decomposition applied to the Mg II and Mg I 2852 lines. The x-axis\nis velocity referenced to the \u03bb = 2802.7 or the \u03bb = 2852.1\nline. We first fit the linear continuum C(v) by averaging\nthe data in two windows at \u22122400 < v < \u22121600 km s\u22121\nand 800 < v < 1600 km s\u22121 , and interpolating between those\npoints. We divide the observed spectrum by the continuum so\nthat the line strengths are fitted to a spectrum normalized to 1.\nWe then fit a Gaussian line profile A2 G(v, \u03bb0 = 2802.71, \u03c3 )\nto the positive velocity data of 1 \u2212 Fobs /C, using only the\npixels at 0 < v < 1600 km s\u22121 . The fitted parameters are a\nconstant continuum level, the intensity A2 , and the dispersion \u03c3 ; the central velocity is held fixed at 0. The parameters are tabulated in Table 1. The dispersion is due to both\nvelocity dispersion and the intrinsic widths of stellar Mg II\nlines, which can be large for cooler stars. The fit is performed\nusing a Levenberg-Marquardt non-linear least squares minimization. Setting A1 = A2 , we duplicate this Gaussian for the\nbluer Mg II line to make Asym (v).\nKnowing Fobs (v), C(v), and Asym (v), we obtain Fem (v) \u00d7\n(1 \u2212 A f low (v)). If the galaxy emission is featureless, then\nFem = 1 and we have measured the absorption of the outflow\ncomponent A f low . If there is some residual Mg II emission,\nthen Fem (v) can be > 1 and we may underestimate the depth\nof the outflow absorption. This is a fairly small effect once\nthe 50 excess-emission galaxies have been removed from the\nsample, but reappears in the subsample of the bluest galaxies\n(Section 6).\nUltimately, the details of decomposing the symmetric absorption do not have a strong effect on the interpretation of\nthe wind component. We attempt this decomposition to keep\nfrom erroneously counting too much symmetric absorption in\nthe wind; this is important since some of the symmetric absorption in both Mg II and Mg I could be due to photospheric\nor zero-velocity ISM rather than outflow absorption, especially in galaxies with many cool stars. There are some degeneracies between the fit parameters, e.g. the allocation of\nabsorption EW between symmetric and blueshifted components; the approach is only robust when the composite spectra\nare high S/N to constrain the symmetric component, which is\nfit to one side of a Gaussian. These issues do not affect our\nconclusions; we do find that both the symmetric and the wind\ncomponents have the same dependence on galaxy properties \u2013\nthey are stronger in more massive objects, as we show below.\nThe middle and upper panels of Figure 8 show the coadded\nspectrum Fobs of the 1356 galaxies excluding the excess emission sample, the symmetric Mg II doublet absorption (multiplied back by the continuum), C(1 \u2212 Asym ), and the outflow\ncomponent (also multiplied by C), C(1 \u2212 A f low )Fem . Proper-\n\n\fOutflows from Star-Forming Galaxies\nties including EW and velocities of the components are tabulated in Table 1.\n4.2. Optical thickness of the absorption\n\nIn optically thin Mg II absorption, the 2796 \u00c5 line is twice\nas strong as the 2803 \u00c5 line. However, Mg II absorbers are\nfrequently optically thick and saturated, in which case the line\ndepths are close to equal (e.g. Steidel & Sargent 1992).\nThe symmetric Gaussian model goes deeper than the red\nwing of the 2796 \u00c5 absorption, which causes the inferred outflow Fem (1 \u2212 A f low ) (blue line in middle panel of Figure 8)\nto still show some excess emission, even though the strong\nexcess-emission galaxies have been weeded out. The cause\nmust be excess emission, since the 2796 \u00c5 symmetric line\ncannot be intrinsically weaker than the 2803 \u00c5 line.\nIn the spectrum of Figure 8 (middle panel), the EWs of the\noutflow absorption component from 0 to -768 km s\u22121 are 1.54\nand 1.37 \u00c5 for the 2796 and 2803 \u00c5 lines, (excluding pixels\nabove continuum to avoid diluting the blueshifted 2803 \u00c5 line\nby emission in the 2796 \u00c5 line). This yields a doublet ratio\nof 1.13, implying quite saturated absorption. Even this is an\nupper limit since the 2803 blueshifted absorption depth is still\nreduced by some emission in the 2796 line. The absorption\ntroughs reach equal depths at -100 km s\u22121 relative to each\nline, suggesting that the true line ratio is close to 1.0 and the\nMg II is highly saturated. We discuss the depth and column\ndensity further in Section 7.1. For saturated absorption, the\nequivalent width is more directly controlled by the velocity\nspread than the column density.\nThe Mg II absorption in both the symmetric and outflow\ncomponents is not optically thin, so a distribution of column\ndensity NH (v) that is Gaussian in velocity can not produce\nan optical depth or absorption A(v) that is Gaussian. For a\nmore detailed discussion of the interaction of optical depth\nand covering fraction, see Rupke et al. (2005a). However,\na superposition of a Gaussian velocity distribution of small\nvelocity-width clouds, each of which is optically thick but has\na small covering fraction, can produce a Gaussian line. Stellar\nphotospheric profiles can also be fit by a Gaussian.\nIn practice, the coadded spectra and blended doublet do not\nallow us to separate optical depth and covering fraction. A\nGaussian is a reasonable fit to the red wing, while for the\nblueshifted absorption, the coaddition of many spectra is analogous to an ensemble of absorbers over a range of optical\ndepth and velocity spread, as modeled by Jenkins (1986) in\ntesting the applicability of the classical doublet ratio method\n(Spitzer 1986). We use the ratio of the two Mg II lines to\nestimate the optical depth and column density in Section 7.1.\nAs Figure 8 shows, the Mg II absorption trough can extend\nquite far to the blue, well beyond \u2212600 km s\u22121 relative to the\n2796 \u00c5 line. It is difficult to measure the extent of blueshifted\nabsorption in the 2803 \u00c5 line because it runs into the 2796 \u00c5\nline and excess emission. In the deepest part of the absorption trough, the two lines agree well. If the lines become optically thin at high negative velocities, the 2796 \u00c5 line would be\nstronger, but this is difficult to measure given blending and a\npossibly non-flat continuum. The Mg I 2852 \u00c5 line is weaker\nthan the Mg II lines but has a similar velocity profile and ratio\nof blueshifted to symmetric absorption.\n4.3. The sawtooth outflow profile\n\n11\n\nThe velocity profile of the Mg II blueshifted absorption in\nthe coadded spectrum shows a characteristic asymmetric or\n\"sawtooth\" shape, with its deepest point around -150 km s\u22121\nand lower absorption at large negative velocities out to nearly\n-1000 km s\u22121 . The Mg I profile has a similar shape. This\nsawtooth shape also appears when the sample is subdivided\nbased on galaxy properties such as mass and star formation\nrate (Section 6). The asymmetric line shape is also seen in\nabsorption in individual galaxy spectra, as shown in Figure\n4, Some individual galaxies could have narrower, distinct absorption systems, as seen in high-resolution spectroscopy of\nlow-redshift outflows (Schwartz & Martin 2004; Rupke &\nVeilleux 2005; see also the simulations of Fujita et al. 2008).\nIn our coadded spectrum, the sawtooth profile expresses the\nmean absorption in front of star-forming galaxies as a function\nof velocity. Individual absorbers are probably optically thick,\nbut the covering factor is less than 100%, so the mean absorption depth is essentially the probability of finding a absorber\nat that velocity. Because individual galaxies exhibit the asymmetric absorption profile (at least in galaxies bright enough to\nsee absorption individually), it seems to be a property of the\nwind physics rather than of the distribution of wind velocities\nover the ensemble. This appears to rule out two toy models\nfor the sawtooth profile: (1) it is solely due to a distribution of\ncharacteristic wind velocities that has fewer winds at high velocity; (2) the winds are well-collimated, and the profile arises\nas we stack fewer galaxies with high outflow velocities because face-on galaxies are rarer. We discuss an interpretation\nof the sawtooth profile in terms of cool gas being accelerated\nby the wind in Section 7.4.\n5. PROPERTIES OF THE SAMPLE GALAXIES\n\nThe large number of galaxies in the Mg II sample allows us\nto measure the dependence of outflows on host galaxy properties by dividing the sample into several parts and coadding\nthem separately. We compute restframe magnitude and color,\nand stellar mass and star formation rate. In this section, we\ndescribe how these are computed from the BRI magnitudes\nand spectra, the calibration to stellar masses from K magnitudes, and calibration of UV SFRs to MIPS 24 \u03bc m fluxes. Because the Mg II sample is selected at restframe 2800 \u00c5, there\nare strong covariances among some of the properties such as\nmass and star formation rate. The distribution of the sample\nin several properties is shown in Figures 10 and 12.\n5.1. Magnitudes and colors\n\nTo derive rest magnitudes, we use an SED interpolation\nprocedure, previously described and tested in Weiner et al.\n(2005) and Willmer et al. (2006). For a DEEP2 galaxy at\nsome redshift z, we redshift the UV+optical SEDs of 34 actual galaxies from the atlas of Kinney et al. (1996), compute\nthe desired restframe quantity, e.g. restframe U \u2212 B color, as\na function of an observed color, e.g. R \u2212 I, and combine the\nrelation derived from the SEDs with the actual R \u2212 I color\nof the DEEP2 galaxy to infer its restframe U \u2212 B color. At\nz \u223c 1.4, the DEEP2 BRI filters correspond roughly to restframe 1800 \u00c5, 2800 \u00c5, and U-band. Inferring a blue magnitude MB and U \u2212 B color effectively extrapolates from a\n2800 \u2212 U observation, so the zeropoint of our U \u2212 B color\nscale might suffer shifts of 0.1 \u2212 0.2 magnitudes when compared to lower redshift data. However, relative measurements\nof color within our sample are accurate. The UV magnitudes\nM2800 and MU are measured quite accurately by our procedure\n\n\f12\n\nWeiner et al.\n\nF IG . 9.- Stellar mass estimates from the SED fitting of Bundy et al. (2006)\nincluding the K-band (x-axis) and from the optical color-M/L relation empirically corrected to K-band masses (y-axis). There is an offset of 0.09 dex and\nRMS dispersion of 0.3 dex, but good overall agreement.\n\nsince they correspond closely to the observed RI filters. We\nalso estimate UV magnitudes at 1500 and 2200 \u00c5, close to the\nGALEX FUV and NUV bandpasses.\n5.2. Stellar masses\n\nStellar masses are best derived from the infrared, but nearIR photometry does not exist for our entire sample. For 33%\nof galaxies with redshifts in the DEEP2 survey, K magnitudes\nand stellar masses were measured with the Palomar 5-m telescope and WIRC camera, over \u223c 80 nights of imaging (Bundy\net al. 2006; Conselice et al. 2008). The remaining two-thirds\ndo not have K magnitudes because the Palomar/WIRC survey does not cover all of the DEEP2 area and misses some\nfainter galaxies in regions where it is less deep. We use the\nrest MB and U \u2212 B to derive a stellar mass (M\u2217 ) estimate using\ncolor-M/L relations (Bell & de Jong 2001; Bell et al. 2003)\nand then empirically correct these to stellar masses computed\nusing K-band photometry and SED fitting by Bundy et al.\n(2006). This is a revision of a similar calibration computed\nin Lin et al. (2007). The details of the calibration and formulae which can be used to derive M\u2217 for DEEP2 galaxies are\ngiven in Appendix A.\nFigure 9 compares the resulting mass estimates from colorM/L to those from K-band; both are for a Chabrier IMF. The\ncolor-M/L masses are 0.09 dex lower with an RMS dispersion\nof 0.30 dex. Although there may be remaining systematics,\nthe relative order of M\u2217 is reliable; our sample spans \u223c 1.5 dex\nin stellar mass, containing both low-mass blue galaxies and\nhigher-mass intermediate-color galaxies. The agreement in\nmass estimate allows using the color-M/L relation uniformly\nover the sample, since K is not always available. Figure 10\ncompares color, magnitude and stellar mass for the sample.\n5.3. Emission line luminosities and velocities\n\nThe primary emission line found in the Mg II sample is the\n[O II] 3727 \u00c5 doublet. We measure its intensity and width as\ndescribed briefly in Weiner et al. (2007): in each DEEP2 1-d\nextracted spectrum, we perform a non-linear least squares fit\nof a double Gaussian, with the doublet line separation fixed\nbut the intensity ratio allowed to vary (although it is generally\nconsistent with the mean value of 1.4). Each fit yields a measurement of the intensity of the doublet, its location, and the\nvelocity dispersion. A similar procedure is used to measure\nthe velocity dispersion in the stacked spectra.\nWe compute a line equivalent width from the intensity and\na continuum measured over a 90 \u00c5 window. The EW and the\ncalibrated BRI photometry are combined to obtain a total restframe line luminosity. This procedure bypasses instrumental\nthroughput, and calibrates out slit losses as long as the ratio\nof emission to continuum is the same inside the slit and outside. For high-z DEEP2 galaxies, which nearly always have\nre f f < 1\u2032\u2032 , the small size and seeing make this a safe assumption.\nThe typical [O II] luminosity is high, \u223c 1042 erg s\u22121 , and\nL([O II]) increases with MB or mass, as does the UV SFR estimate described below. However, we found that deriving star\nformation rates from [O II] luminosity is quite dependent on\nassumptions about the metallicity and extinction (e.g. Kewley et al. 2004; Weiner et al. 2007). These are unmeasured\nfor this sample, and we expect evolution in them compared to\nlower-redshift samples (Shapley et al. 2005). Locally and at\nz \u223c 0.8, there are also strong trends in nebular line ratios as\na function of mass (Moustakas, Kennicutt & Tremonti 2006;\nWeiner et al. 2007). Without a calibration of these trends,\nSFR estimates from [O II] can be systematically off. Applying a low-redshift calibration (e.g. from Kennicutt 1998) produces SFRs that are \u223c 0.5 dex above the IR and far-UV SFR\nindicators discussed in the next section. We advise caution\nin applying [O II] SFRs at z > 1 without better calibrations,\nwhich are beyond the scope of this paper.\n5.4. Star formation rates\n\nEstimating star formation rates for high-z galaxies generally\nrelies on local calibrations and models. No SFR estimators at\nhigh redshift are both sensitive and well tested; emission-line\nand UV estimators are affected by extinction, while mid-IR\nsurveys detect fewer objects and may be affected by uncertainties in the IR SEDs. We explore both IR and far-UV estimates of the SFR, keeping in mind that there may be systematic effects. In the end we are able to reconcile these estimates\nby stacking the far-IR data.\n5.4.1. SFR from mid-infrared luminosity\n\nThe mid- to far-IR luminosity emitted by dust heated by\nyoung stars yields an estimate of the SFR that is not affected\nby extinction, though it can be affected by AGN emission and\nby variations in the IR SEDs. Although only a small number of galaxies are detected in the IR, the SFR(IR) is valuable\nboth for calibrating UV and optical estimates of SFR, and for\ncomparing to studies of outflows in local IR-luminous galaxies (Heckman et al. 2000; Rupke et al. 2005a; Martin 2005).\nOne DEEP2 field, the Extended Groth Strip, has been imaged at 24 \u03bc m by scan mapping with MIPS, the Multiband\nImaging Photometer for Spitzer (Rieke et al. 2004), to a sensitivity of 83 \u03bc Jy at \u223c 5\u03c3 . We matched the DEEP2 galaxies\nto a catalog of 24 \u03bc m fluxes constructed by PSF fitting (Davis\net al. 2007). Of the 1406-galaxy sample, 194 are in the area\nimaged by MIPS at 24 \u03bc m and 38 galaxies are detected.\n\n\fOutflows from Star-Forming Galaxies\n\n13\n\nF IG . 10.- Magnitude, color, and stellar mass estimates for galaxies in the Mg II sample. The axes span 7.5 mag or 3 dex for magnitude and mass. The\ndependence of stellar mass on color means that the sample spans a wider range of mass than UV or blue magnitude.\n\nWe estimate a total infared luminosity LIR (8 \u2212 1000\u03bc m)\nfrom the 24 \u03bc m flux using an SED of Dale & Helou (2002)\nwith \u03b1 = 2.0, which is applicable to star-forming galaxies and\nfollows the average trend of 8 \u2212 24 \u03bc m color with redshift\nin DEEP2 galaxies. Using this SED produces K-corrections\nsimilar to those obtained by averaging a large number of\nDale & Helou SEDs, as done by Bell et al. (2005). At\nz = 1.4, the conversion is not a strong function of redshift, and\nlog LIR (L\u2299 ) \u2243 log S24 + 9.63, with S24 in \u03bc Jy. The 83 \u03bc Jy\nlimit corresponds to an IR luminosity of 1011.5 L\u2299 , and the\nmedian log LIR is 11.73. 34 of the 38 MIPS-detected sources\nare luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs, LIR > 1011 \u2299), and\nfour of the 38 galaxies have LIR > 1012 L\u2299 , and are ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs).\nWe estimate star formation rates by combining the\nUV(2800 \u00c5) and IR luminosities, using the prescription of\nBell et al. (2005):\nSFR(IR) = 9.8 \u00d7 10\u221211(LIR + 2.2\u03bd L(2800 \u00c5))\n\n(3)\n\nwhere LIR and L(2800) = 1.5\u03bd I\u03bd (2800 \u00c5) are in solar luminosities; this is defined for a Kroupa IMF (Kroupa 2001). The\n\nIR term dominates this sum; in the MIPS-detected sample, the\nmedian log LIR /(2.2\u03bd L(2800)) is 0.9 dex.\nBecause the MIPS galaxies are IR-selected, they will have\na larger IR/UV than typical. It is also possible that AGN contribute to the IR luminosity in some of the objects. However,\nonly one of the 38 MIPS sources is also among the 50 excess Mg II emission AGN objects. Another systematic effect\nis the use of a single typical star-forming IR SED to convert\nto total LIR . At z = 1.4 the 24 \u03bc m band of MIPS is at restframe 10 \u03bc m, and the observed flux could be enhanced by\nPAH emission or depressed by silicate absorption. Additionally, the dust temperature could be different from local galaxies; Papovich et al. (2007) and Rigby et al. (2008) find that\nthe 24 \u03bc m flux can overestimate the SFR in IR-luminous z \u223c 2\ngalaxies. These issues are difficult to calibrate out; they probably contribute of order 0.3 dex scatter to the SFR(IR) (e.g.\nBell et al. 2005), and there can be systematic overestimates\nof the SFR by a few tenths of a dex. In the next section we\nattempt to improve the SFR measurement by comparing IR\nand far-UV, stacking the MIPS images to get a median flux\nfor non-MIPS-detected objects.\n\n\f14\n\nWeiner et al.\n5.4.2. SFR from UV luminosity\n\nWe can also estimate the SFR from UV luminosity. At\nz = 1.4, our B and R filters are roughly at restframe 1800\nand 2800 \u00c5. We compute absolute AB magnitudes at 1500\nand 2200 \u00c5 using our SED K-correction procedure, and compute the slope \u03b2 of the UV continuum, f\u03bb \u221d \u03bb \u03b2 . The UV\nslope has been used as an indicator of extinction by Meurer\net al. (1999), who found a far-UV extinction at 1500 \u00c5:\nAFUV = 4.43 + 1.99\u03b2 for local starburst galaxies. This relation may vary depending on galaxy type; Bell (2002) found\nthat local normal galaxies deviate to lower AFUV . Large samples of local galaxies studied in the UV with GALEX suggest\nthat applying the Meurer et al. (1999) prescription can overestimate AFUV (Seibert et al. 2005; Treyer et al. 2007; Salim\net al. 2007).\nAlthough our z = 1.4 sample is selected at 2800 \u00c5 and\nis forming stars rapidly, it is not clear that local starbursts\nare the best approximation as these are a highly selected\nsample. We computed FUV attenuation using the relation\nAFUV = 3.16 + 1.69\u03b2 (Seibert et al. 2005, as updated by\nTreyer et al. 2007). We correct the FUV luminosity and compute an SFR following Kennicutt (1998), scaled by 0.7 to convert from a Salpeter to Kroupa IMF for consistency with the\nSFR(IR) estimate:\nSFR(FUV )(M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u221228L\u03bd (1500 \u00c5)(erg/s/Hz).\n(4)\nThe AFUV prescription of Salim et al. (2007) yields nearly\nidentical SFR, while the prescription of Meurer et al. (1999)\nyields SFRs 0.4 dex higher. The accuracy is limited since\nthere is substantial scatter about the AFUV \u2212 \u03b2 relation, 0.9\nmag in the Seibert et al. (2005) sample. The median values\nand \u00b134% range for \u03b2 and AFUV in our no-excess-emission\ngalaxy sample are \u22120.65 \u00b1 0.42 and 2.06 \u00b1 0.71 respectively.\nThe UV continuum slope is correlated with magnitude and\nrestframe color - brighter, redder, more massive galaxies have\nredder UV continua.\nFigure 11 shows a comparison of SFR estimates from the\nfar-IR and from the far-UV with the Seibert et al. (2005) \u03b2 \u2212\nAFUV relation, for 194 galaxies in the Mg II sample and MIPS\nimaging area. For galaxies not detected by MIPS, we set an\nupper limit based on the 4\u03c3 limit at 24 \u03bc m of 65 \u03bc Jy.\nBecause many of the galaxies are not individually detected\nby MIPS, we divided the FUV sample into three ranges at\nthe 25 and 75th percentiles. For those galaxies with MIPS\nimaging, we then median stacked the MIPS 24 \u03bc m images.\nThis yields a good detection in all three ranges. The median\nSFR(IR+UV) for the three ranges is plotted against the median SFR(FUV) as the large circles in Figure 11.\nThe SFR(FUV) following Seibert et al. (2005) is in good\nagreement with the SFR(IR); it is 0.1 dex low for the more\nrapidly star-forming galaxies. The Meurer et al. (1999) prescription for AFUV yields SFRs 0.4 dex higher than the Seibert AFUV , and would overestimate SFR by \u223c 0.3 dex for this\nsample. We adopt the SFRs derived from the Seibert AFUV\nand plot them in Figure 12. These galaxies are on average\nhigher SFR, more IR-luminous, and can be more extincted\nthan the local samples for which the UV relations were defined. However, the stacked-IR to UV comparison allows us\nto infer an SFR for all galaxies in the sample that is consistent\nwith mid-IR determinations, even though only a small number of the galaxies have individual mid-IR measurements. As\n\nF IG . 11.- Comparison of star formation rates inferred from 24 \u03bc m + UV,\nand from far-UV luminosity with the Seibert et al. (2005) relation for AFUV ,\nfor 194 galaxies in the Mg II sample with MIPS imaging. Calibrations refer\nto a Kroupa IMF. Leftward-pointing arrows are upper limits for galaxies not\ndetected by MIPS. The large open circles show the median SFR(FUV) for\ngalaxies subdivided into three ranges of LFUV , and the SFR(IR+UV) derived\nby a median stacking of their MIPS 24 \u03bc m images.\n\nwith the mid-IR measurement, AGN luminosity could contribute to the far-UV, but only a small fraction of the galaxies\nhave evidence for an AGN, based on Mg II emission. In addition, of the sample galaxies in the EGS field, very few are\ndetected in X-rays (Nandra et al. 2007).\nThe stacked MIPS detections imply that the galaxies in the\n< 25%ile, 25 \u2212 75%ile, and > 75%ile of SFR(FUV) have\nmedian IR luminosities LIR (8 \u2212 1000\u03bc m) = 3.1 \u00d7 1010, 1.3 \u00d7\n1011, and 2.5 \u00d7 1011 L\u2299 respectively, and median SFRs of 7,\n18, and 34 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . The median galaxy in the z \u223c 1.4 Mg II\nsample is roughly at the LIRG threshold of LIR = 1011 L\u2299 .\n5.5. Correlation of galaxy properties with SFR\n\nFigure 10 plots galaxy magnitudes, stellar mass, and color\nagainst each other, and Figure 12 compares magnitude and\nstellar mass estimates against star formation indicators. Because the sample is selected at restframe 2800 \u00c5, color, MB\nand stellar mass are highly covariant. The color-magnitude\nplot shows that the sample contains blue galaxies at a range\nof luminosities, but few red-sequence galaxies; red galaxies\nare disfavored by the UV selection and their lower abundance\nat z > 1 (Willmer et al. 2006). SFR as estimated from the UV\nis strongly correlated with MB but somewhat less well with\nstellar mass: galaxies with high extinction-corrected FUV luminosity are fairly high-mass. The SFRs are for a Kroupa\nIMF while the stellar masses are normalized to a Chabrier\nIMF, which is just slightly lower.\nNote that the SFRFUV correlates fairly tightly with MB ,\nmore so than with other quantities; SFRFUV is less tightly\ncorrelated with UV luminosity itself. This is caused by the\nextinction correction - the UV slope and UV \u2212 B color are\nhighly correlated (see also Treyer et al. 2007). The correla-\n\n\fOutflows from Star-Forming Galaxies\n\n15\n\nF IG . 12.- Blue magnitude and stellar mass compared to [O II ] luminosity in erg/sec, and star formation rate estimated from the FUV luminosity in M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\nThe SFR(FUV) is corrected for extinction and the [O II ] luminosity is not. The extinction correction causes MB and SFR(FUV ) to be highly correlated.\n\ntion is also partially induced by the K-correction procedure\nsince we have to infer MB from restframe U and color. If the\nsample included red non-starforming galaxies, they would fall\nto lower SFR, below the correlation.\nThe velocity linewidth \u03c3 of the [O II] emission is correlated\nwith magnitude and stellar mass, with considerable scatter.\nMuch of this scatter is due to the large scatter in the highredshift linewidth Tully-Fisher relation (Weiner et al. 2006),\nwhich may be induced both by inclination and by details of\nthe internal kinematics. Velocity width and SFR are essentially uncorrelated, largely due to scatter in the estimators.\n6. OUTFLOW DEPENDENCE ON GALAXY PROPERTIES\n\nTo study how galaxy properties affect the outflow, we divide\nthe no-excess-emission sample into subsamples binned in either magnitude, stellar mass, or star formation rate in turn, and\ncoadd the spectra with these bins. We choose the bin limits to\nseparate the bottom 25%, middle 25%-75%, and top 25% in\neach property.\n6.1. Outflows exist across the range of luminosity, mass, and\n\nSFR\n\nThe panels of Figure 13 show the coadded spectra at Mg II\nfor subdivisions in MB , M\u2217 , and SFR(FUV ) respectively. Table 1 summarizes the results of the decomposition into symmetric and outflow absorption, and the [O II] emission in each\ncoadded spectrum.\nThe symmetric absorption is strongly dependent on the\nproperties, being much weaker in the low-mass, low-SFR end\nof the sample. The dispersion of the symmetric Mg II absorption varies more strongly than the velocity dispersion of\n[O II]; it is high in redder/more massive objects. These objects contain a cooler stellar population, with stronger and\nbroader photospheric Mg II absorption (as in e.g. the models of Rodr\u0131\u0301guez-Merino et al. 2005), so that the dispersion\nreflects stellar properties. Note that there is almost no absorption at zero velocity in the bluer, lower-mass, lower-SFR\nsubsample. This is surprising since internal absorption by the\ngalaxies' ISM should occur, on average, at zero velocity, and\neven low columns of cool gas produce Mg II . It appears that\nin the lower-mass galaxies all of the cool gas between us and\nthe UV-emitting stars is outflowing.\nThe outflow component of the absorption exists in all subdivisions of the sample. Its equivalent width is higher in the\n\n\f16\n\nWeiner et al.\n\nbrighter, redder, high-mass, high-SFR subdivisions \u2013 since all\nof these galaxy properties are correlated, it is not possible to\nisolate one parameter that predicts outflow strength much better than the others. Although the blueshifted absorption is\nstronger in the larger galaxies, it is still fairly strong in the\nsmaller, low-mass galaxies. We have not found any class of\ngalaxy in the sample that does not exhibit outflow absorption,\njustifying the claim above that the Mg II outflows are ubiquitous in the DEEP2 sample. Although this sample is selected\nto all be fairly luminous at restframe 2800 \u00c5, it covers a range\nof 10\u00d7 in SFR and B luminosity, and 30\u00d7 in stellar mass.\nWe quantify the velocity extent of the outflow absorption in\ntwo ways: the median velocity of absorption, Vmed , and the velocity where outflow-component absorption reaches a threshold depth. We lightly smooth the outflow absorption spectrum\nA f low with a boxcar of 5 pixels (68 km s\u22121 ) to reduce noise,\nand count from \u2212100km s\u22121 downward to more negative velocities until reaching a pixel that is above 0.75 or 0.9 of the\ncontinuum value. These velocities define the locations V25%\nand V10% , respectively, the extent of contiguous 25% or 10%\nabsorption depth. These threshold measurements are more robust than attempting to measure a maximum outflow velocity,\nsince in the composite spectra, the outflow absorption is not a\nset of discrete components, but gradually asymptotes to zero\nat high velocities.\nFigure 14 overplots the absorption components of the three\nsubsamples in mass and SFR, demonstrating that the highmass and high-SFR subsamples show greater absorption at\n\u2212800 < V < \u2212400 km s\u22121 than the intermediate and lowmass or -SFR subsamples. The velocity extents of outflow\nare tabulated in Table 1 and plotted in Figures 15 and 16.\nBoth the depth of the outflow absorption and its velocity extent are greater for the brighter, high-mass, high-SFR, reddercolor fractions of the sample. This is similar to the trend\nfound by Shapley et al. (2003) in z \u223c 3 Lyman-break galaxies, where low-ionization lines are stronger in the galaxies\nwith higher SFR, larger velocity offset, and redder UV continuum slope. Fitting a power-law dependence of the velocity\nof the 10% absorption depth, V10% , on mass or SFR, yields\n0.38 . The power-law slopes\nV10% \u221d M\u22170.17 and V10% \u221d SFRFUV\nfor V25% are 0.11 and 0.17 on M\u2217 and SFRFUV respectively.\nThese measures are dependent on the choice of the absorp0.3 . It is\ntion threshold, but it appears that that Vwind \u223c SFRFUV\nsuggestive that the velocity appears to have a stronger dependence on SFR than on stellar mass, but this could be because\nour sample spans a larger range in stellar mass than it does in\nSFR. Notably, the z = 1.4 starforming galaxies have a similar\ndependence of wind velocity on SFR to the low-z ULIRGs\nstudied by Martin (2005) in Na I, who found an upper envelope of wind velocity at V \u223c SFR0.35 .\n6.2. Search for outflow dependence on galaxy type\n\nLocally, starburst-driven winds are more frequently seen\nin face-on galaxies, due to collimation of biconical outflows\n(Heckman et al. 2000; Rupke et al. 2005b). 118 of the Mg II\nsample galaxies are in the Extended Groth Strip and have HST\nACS I-band imaging (Davis et al. 2007; Lotz et al. 2008).\nWe divided them up by axis ratio as measured with SExtractor\n(Bertin & Arnouts 1996) in an attempt to separate face-on and\nedge-on galaxies. We did not find a correlation between axis\nratio and wind strength or wind velocity. An examination of\nthe ACS images shows that the galaxies are too irregular and\nlow surface brightness to trust the axis ratio as a measure of\n\ndisk inclination. Many may not be disks. Because the imaging\nis at restframe U-band, the high-z galaxies are more irregular,\nand their images appear to be highly affected by starforming\nregions and by dust.\nWe also classified the galaxies by eye into six broad morphological types: face-on, edge-on, chain, irregular, merger,\nand compact, finding 37, 13, 18, 28, 3, and 19 respectively.\nThe large number of chain, irregular and compact galaxies\nindicates that many z = 1.4 galaxies are not obviously disky\nin the rest U. When we coadd the spectra within each type,\nwe find that all types exhibit blueshifted Mg II absorption \u2013\neven the 3 mergers have enough signal to detect it. However,\nthe noise in the spectra and the variance among individual objects within a type prevent us from determining whether the\noutflows in one type are stronger than another. Note however\nthat the merger fraction is low, as is true of z \u223c 1 galaxies in\ngeneral (Lotz et al. 2008). While many galaxies are irregular\nor disturbed, major mergers are not a prerequisite for driving\na wind in this sample.\nIn the ACS imaging, the median of the galaxies' Petrosian\nradii is 5.2 kpc and there is a weak correlation between size\nand magnitude, and no obvious correlation between size and\noutflow. These tests show that winds are found across all\nstar-forming types at z = 1.4, but they neither prove nor disprove collimation of winds in this sample. A larger number\nof galaxies with HST near-IR imaging, and spectra at Mg II,\nare needed to search for collimation and morphological type\ndependence.\n7. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION\n7.1. Physical properties of the outflow\n\nThe amount of gas contained in the outflows is of great interest in gauging its importance to galactic and IGM evolution. Because the Mg II lines are optically thick, approaching\nthe \"flat part\" of the curve of growth, we cannot infer column density directly from the equivalent width. Here we use\nthe classical doublet ratio method to approximate the optical depth and column density (Spitzer 1968; see also Jenkins\n1986 and Rupke et al. 2005a).\nThe EW ratio of the two Mg II lines, W2796 /W2803, varies\nfrom 2 to 1 for optical depth \u03c4 from 0 to infinity. For a single\nabsorber, there is a relation between the EW ratio and the optical depth at line center \u03c40 (C in the notation of Spitzer 1968,\nTable 2.1). For an ensemble of absorbers, the relation does\nnot strictly apply, but generally yields accurate results in the\nmean if the saturation is not too strong (Jenkins 1986). The\ndoublet ratio is given by F(2\u03c40 )/F(\u03c40 ) where F is the integral\nof transmission over the line, and the column density in atoms\ncm\u22122 is (Spitzer 1968):\nlog N = log\n\n2F(\u03c40 )\nW2803\n\u2212 log 1/2 \u2212 log\u03bb f2803 + 20.053. (5)\n\u03bb\n\u03c0 \u03c40\n\nWe computed EWs for the Mg II lines in the outflow components of the no-excess-emission sample (1356 galaxies),\nand in the subsamples split by stellar mass and SFR. We\ncompute the EW between 0 and -768 km s\u22121 for each line,\nand exclude above-continuum pixels to eliminate those most\ngrossly affected by emission. These EWs and the inferred optical depths are tabulated in Table 2.

Given systematics,\nthere are no significant differences between the subsamples in\ndoublet ratio or in optical depth.\nGenerally, the doublet ratios derived are 1.1 to 1.2, or even\nlower. Adjusting the velocity interval has little effect. Computing the ratio directly on the observed spectrum, rather than\nthe wind component only, yields lower doublet ratios, around\n1.0.\nFor doublet ratios 1.20 \u2212 1.10, the optical depths are \u03c40 =\n4 \u2212 20, and F(\u03c40 )/\u03c40 = 0.33 \u2212 0.093, so there is a factor of\n\u223c 3.5 range in inferred column density. To get a characteristic column density of the outflow, we take typical values\nW2803 = 1.37 \u00c5 and \u03c40 = 10, with log\u03bb f = 2.933 (Morton\n1991). The inferred column density is log NMgII = 14.5 atoms\ncm\u22122 . The optical depths derived here, \u03c40 \u223c 4 \u2212 20, range\nhigh enough that the results of Jenkins (1986) may not apply\nand the inferred column densities could be underestimated.\nTo be conservative, we make no ionization correction; Mg I\nis present but relatively weak. The presence of Mg I in\nthe outflow, with ionization potential 7.7 eV, suggests some\namount of cold gas and/or shielding from UV radiation. The\nMg I line has a similar profile to Mg II, but the Mg I is not\nas deep. Mg I could be weaker due to lower column density\nor lower covering fraction. Because Mg II is saturated and\nMg I has a higher oscillator strength than Mg II , getting the\n\nobserved Mg I by lowering the column requires fine-tuning\nthe Mg I/Mg II ratio to a precise value to obtain unsaturated\nabsorption. A more likely explanation is that Mg I is saturated but has lower covering fraction than Mg II; similarly we\nfound a higher covering fraction for Mg II than Rupke et al.\n(2005b) find for Na I in low-redshift outflows. A modeling\nof the Mg II, Mg I, and incident UV field is beyond the scope\nof this paper, but could yield interesting constraints on wind\nphysics (cf. Murray et al. 2007).\nAssuming a solar abundance ratio of log Mg/H = \u22124.42\nand an Mg depletion of \u20131.2 dex, typical in the local ISM\n(Savage & Sembach 1996) and reasonable for outflows given\nthat local outflows in luminous galaxies are dusty (Heckman\n2002), the inferred atomic column density is NH = 1.3 \u00d7 1020\natoms cm\u22122 . The average galaxy in the DEEP2 z \u223c 1.4\nsample is expelling and covered by at least a sub-damped\nLyman-alpha absorber's worth of outflowing gas. This column density is integrated over viewing angle and clumpiness of absorbers, so it includes the covering fractions C\u03a9\nand C f . The column density is moderately lower than the\ncolumns of \u223c 1021 atoms cm\u22122 inferred from Na I in lowredshift infrared-luminous galaxies (Heckman et al. 2000;\nRupke et al. 2005b). Our estimate is conservative in the optical depth and lack of ionization correction, and possible effects of highly saturated Mg II , while those authors have had\nto apply a large ionization correction for Na I, so the measurements are essentially consistent.\nThe IR luminosities of the Heckman sample are roughly\ncomparable to the DEEP2 galaxies, while the Rupke sample\nis at higher LIR in the mean, since only half of the DEEP2\ngalaxies would be LIRGs. The major difference is frequency\nof occurrence: the Heckman and Rupke samples are relatively special objects locally, while the DEEP2 sample represents a broad range of the luminous star-forming objects at\nz \u223c 1.4, where the global SFR is higher. This reflects the overall higher SFR of individual galaxies at high redshift (e.g. Le\nFloc'h et al. 2005; Noeske et al. 2007a), but there may also\nbe differences in the physical properties of the objects, compared further in Section 7.3.\nThe column density, velocity and a characteristic size allow\n\n\f18\n\nWeiner et al.\n\nan estimate of the typical mass outflow rate.

The sizes of the outflows are not easily constrained but\nmust be at least of order the galaxy radius, since the covering\nfactor is large. In our sample, the median Petrosian radius for\ngalaxies with ACS imaging is 5.2 kpc and the 50% outflow\nvelocity is 279 km s\u22121 . For a thin shell geometry and using\ntypical numbers, with \u03bc = 1.4:\n\u1e40 =\n\n\u1e40 \u2243 22 M\u2299 yr\u22121\n\nv\nR\nNH\n.\n1020 cm\u22122 5 kpc 300 km s\u22121\n\n(8)\n\nThis mass outflow rate is similar to the galaxies' star formation rates of 10\u2013100 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , supporting the idea that\ngalactic winds powered by star formation and the resultant\nsupernovae drive an outflow of \u1e40 \u223c SFR (e.g. Heckman et\nal. 2000; Pettini et al. 2000; Heckman 2002; Veilleux et al.\n2005). A mass outflow rate roughly equal to the SFR, fueled\nby continuing accretion, can help explain trends of SFR and\nmetallicity in high-redshift galaxies (Erb 2008). The star formation rate, characteristic velocity, and outflow EW are all\nhigher in the more massive/luminous objects in our sample,\nso the mass outflow in large galaxies is substantial.\nA critical unknown is the radial extent that the outflow\nreaches. Some dramatic instances of superwinds in local\ngalaxies that reach large distances are seen in X-ray and H\u03b1\nimaging (e.g. Strickland et al. 2004). It is well known that\nMg II QSO absorption line systems occur within \u223c 50 kpc\nof luminous galaxies, and also that luminous galaxies have a\nlarge covering factor within that radius, possibly dependent on\ngalaxy type (e.g. Lanzetta & Bowen 1990; Bergeron & Boisse\n1991; Steidel, Dickinson & Persson 1994; Bowen, Blades &\nPettini 1995; Chen & Tinker 2008). However, whether these\nsystems are mostly related to galactic outflows is debated (e.g.\nBond et al. 2001; Steidel et al. 2002; Prochter, Prochaska, &\nBurles 2006; Bouch\u00e9 et al. 2006; Kaprczak et al. 2007; Tinker & Chen 2008). From these examples, it is suggestive, but\nnot definitive, that the Mg II outflows could reach large distances, tens of kpc or more. In the next section we use outflow\nvelocities to discuss whether the gas can escape.\n7.2. Can winds escape from galaxies?\nGalactic winds are the prime suspect for the enrichment of\nthe intergalactic medium. The widespread detection of metals in intergalactic and intracluster gas reveals that, somehow,\ngas must get out of galaxies. The details of this process are\ndifficult to model, and a number of treatments have come to\ndifferent answers on the significance of gas and metal escape\nas a function of galaxy mass. Some have favored gas escape\nfrom the shallower potential wells of small galaxies and dark\nhalos (Larson 1974; Dekel & Silk 1986) while others suggest\n\nthat the ISM dynamics and loading of cool gas into the wind\nare more important than the depth of the potential (De Young\n& Heckman 1994; Strickland & Stevens 2000).\nHere the best probe we have is to compare the wind velocity\nto the galaxy escape velocity; we assume that the observed\nhigh velocity wind gas has already punched out of the disk or\ndensest regions of the ISM, since its global covering fraction\nis significant.\nTo estimate the galaxy escape velocity, we scale the [O II]\nemission linewidths \u03c3 , which are an estimator of the circular\nvelocity Vc . For a halo with outer radius rh and a flat rotation\ncurve, the escape velocity at R is Vesc (R)2 = 2Vc2 ln (1 + rh /R)\n(Binney & Tremaine 1987). For reasonable halo mass distributions, Vesc \u2243 3Vc , and is only weakly dependent on the outer\nradius rh . The line-of-sight emission linewidths are related to\nthe rotation velocity by \u03c3 \u223c (0.5 to 0.6)Vc , where \u03c3 incorporates an average over inclinations, as observed, but Vc is\nthe true value (Rix et al. 1997; Kobulnicky & Gebhardt 2000;\nWeiner et al. 2006). There is scatter in this relation of \u223c 25%;\nin the mean it implies that\nVesc \u2243 (5 to 6) \u00d7 \u03c3 ([O II]).\n\n(9)\n\nTo be conservative we have used the high factor of 6 in\ncomputing Vesc for Figures 15 and 16. These figures show\nVesc based on the composite [O II] linewidth and the median\nand \u00b134% range of Vesc based on the individual linewidth\nmeasurements of galaxies in each subsample. Errors on the\nlinewidths tend to broaden the velocity distribution. The\nthreshold velocity where Mg II absorption reaches 10%, V10% ,\nis moderately higher than median Vesc in the subsamples of\nlow and intermediate mass and SFR. However, in the highmass or high-SFR subsample, V10% is substantially more than\nthe median Vesc estimated from the galaxy velocity widths.\nThis effect is caused by the tail of high-velocity absorption\nshown in the high-mass, high-SFR subsamples in Figure 14.\nThe high velocities in the tail of the outflow distribution\nsuggest that low-ionization gas is able to reach large radius or\neven escape. This could give rise to Mg II halo absorption systems, but more rigorous modeling of the EW distribution and\ncovering factor will be necessary to confirm that. Prochter et\nal. (2006) have argued that the redshift evolution of the number of strong Mg II absorbers links them to the global SFR\nevolution and to starburst events in low-mass galaxies. However, statistical detections of the associated light and the dust\ncontent of Mg II absorbers suggest a link to outflows from\nmassive galaxies (Zibetti et al. 2007; M\u00e9nard and Chelouche\n2008).\nBouch\u00e9 et al. (2006) advocated an outflow origin (rather\nthan kinematics governed by halo mass) for Mg II absorbers.\nThis was based on an anti-correlation between absorber\nequivalent width (velocity spread) and host halo mass, derived\nfrom clustering statistics. However, we do find a correlation\nof outflow EW or velocity spread with galaxy mass. A more\nsophisticated treatment of the clustering based on halo occupation suggests that the absorber-halo mass relation is partly\nrelated to the shocking of cold gas in very massive halos (Tinker & Chen 2008). The ubiquity of Mg II outflows that we\nfind and the correlation of SFR and outflow strength suggest\nthat at least some fraction of Mg II absorbers arise in outflows\nfrom massive galaxies, but there is not yet a fully consistent\nlink, and there could be multiple causes for Mg II absorbers.\n\n\fOutflows from Star-Forming Galaxies\n\n19\n\nF IG . 13.- Mg II absorption for subsamples split by galaxy properties. In each panel, co-added spectra are shown for three subsamples, of low quartile, middle\n50%, and high quartile. The subsamples are divided on: MB absolute magnitude (upper left panel), M\u2217 stellar mass (upper right), and SFRFUV (lower left). The\nco-added spectra are decomposed into continuum (green straight line), symmetric absorption (red gaussians), and blueshifted absorption (blue asymmetric line),\nas in Figure 8.\n\n7.3. Comparison to low-redshift winds and IR-luminous\n\ngalaxies\nGiven the galaxies' range of SFR from 10-100 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ,\nand the median Petrosian radius of 5.2 kpc in the subset with\nACS imaging, essentially all of the galaxies are above the criterion of SFR > 0.1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 kpc\u22122 where winds are typically\nfound in the local universe (Heckman 2002). This suggests\nthat the criterion also applies to high redshift galaxies, or conversely that it is no surprise that winds are ubiquitous in this\nsample. Because IR-luminous galaxies are more common at\nz = 1 (Le Floc'h et al. 2005) and the higher SFR at z = 1 occurs across the entirety of the starforming population (Noeske\n\net al. 2007a), in retrospect it might have been expected that\nwinds should be common at z > 1.\nMartin (2005) established in low-z ULIRGs that the upper\nenvelope of the outflow velocity detected in Na I absorption\ndepends weakly on SFR, Vwind \u223c SFR0.35 . As noted above,\nwe find a similar power-law exponent, Vwind \u223c SFR0.3 , for the\nz = 1.4 star-forming galaxies, even though these are mostly\nwell below ULIRG luminosities. Rupke et al. (2005b) found\na wide dispersion of outflow velocities in galaxies with SFR\n& 100M\u2299 yr\u22121 , but a correlation between outflow velocity\nand SFR or Vc when both IR-luminous galaxies and dwarfs\nwith winds are considered.

The open circles and\nvertical errorbars are the median and \u00b134% range of escape velocity computed from the [O II ] linewidth of galaxies in that bin, Vesc = 6\u03c3 ([O II ]). The\nXes are the average escape velocity from the [O II ] dispersion in the coadded\nspectrum. Lower panel: the EW of outflow Mg II absorption in the coadded\nspectra in three bins of stellar mass.\n\nrelation of Na I column with SFR and galaxy mass. Sato et\nal. (2008) use spectra from DEEP2 to study outflows in Na\nI at z \u223c 0.6, and find that the detection fraction of winds is\nsignificantly higher in 24 \u03bc m detected galaxies than in other\nsimilarly massive galaxies. The Sato et al. sample does show\nsome signs of outflow in galaxies without ongoing star formation, a population we do not probe in this sample. Our results\nagree with the sense of these trends: higher SFR galaxies have\ndeeper and faster outflow absorption.\nComparing the z \u223c 1.4 sample to the low-redshift IRluminous galaxies of Rupke et al. (2005b), the DEEP2 Mg II\nsample has SFR and LIR more like Rupke's IRGs (LIR >\n1011L\u2299 ) than his ULIRGs; the median DEEP2 galaxy is just\nat the 1011L\u2299 threshold. However, the z \u223c 1.4 galaxies are\nsomewhat more likely to host winds and to have higher outflow velocities than the low-redshift IRGs. Our absorption\ndepth for winds in DEEP2, 55%, corresponds to detection\nfrequency times clumpiness covering fraction in the Rupke\nIRGs, which is lower at C\u03a9C f \u2243 0.2. The velocity to which\nwe detect winds is also higher. Rupke et al. attempt to define\na maximum velocity of robustly detected absorption by vmax\ncontaining \u223c 90% of the absorption and find the low-z IRGs\n\u22121\nhave vmax = 301+145\n\u221298 km s . For comparison, we find that the\nvelocity containing 50% of absorption Vmed is often 250\u2013300\nkm s\u22121 (Table 1), suggesting that vmax is much higher. We\nfind that at 10% absorption depth, V10% = 400 to 650 km s\u22121 .\nRupke et al. (2005b) find almost no absorbers at > 600\nkm s\u22121 in star-formation dominated galaxies, and we find significant column at that velocity. It is quite possible that this\ncomes from the difference between Na I and Mg II as tracers.\n\nWith its higher ionization potential, Mg II should be easier to\nfind in low column density gas. We also find that Mg II is\nclose to fully saturated, with a doublet ratio of 1.1 or even\nlower, while low-z Na I studies find somewhat less saturated\nabsorption at ratios 1.2-1.3 (Heckman et al. 2000; Rupke et\nal. 2005b).\nThe Mg II study of very luminous post-starburst galaxies at\nz \u223c 0.6 by Tremonti et al. (2007) found discrete absorbers\nat significantly higher outflow velocities than in our sample, often above 1000 km s\u22121 . Those galaxies, being poststarbursts are rather different from our sample and probably\ninstances of AGN-driven rather than star formation driven\nwinds. AGN-driven winds are expected to reach higher velocities than star formation-driven winds observationally and\ntheoretically (Veilleux et al. 2005; Scannapieco & Oh 2004;\nThacker et al. 2006).\nHeckman et al. (2000) found relatively little dependence\nof the outflow speed on host galaxy Vc , using a mix of Na\nI and X-ray temperature measurements to obtain wind speed.\nThis result suggested that gas preferentially escapes from lowmass galaxies. In contrast, in the z \u223c 1.4 sample, we do find\na dependence of outflow speed on galaxy mass, possibly due\nto the more uniform use of Mg II as an outflow probe and the\nmore homogeneous galaxy sample (versus the local samples\nwhich tend to comprise IR-luminous galaxies and dwarfs with\nfew intermediate objects).\nRupke et al. (2005b) suggested that gas could escape from\nULIRGs, and thus that massive galaxies at high redshift influence the IGM; deep potentials do not inhibit wind formation.\nMartin (2005) also suggested that the dependence of velocity\n\n\fOutflows from Star-Forming Galaxies\n\nF IG . 16.- As Figure 15, but for SFR(FUV).

Our finding of outflow velocities at or greater than\nthe escape velocity, and a greater effect in the high-SFR subsample, reinforces the point. A large fraction of the global\nstar formation occurs in high-mass galaxies (e.g. Le Floc'h\net al. 2005; Noeske et al. 2007b); if outflows scale positively\nwith SFR, high-mass star forming galaxies have a significant\nimpact on the enrichment and evolution of the IGM.\n7.4. Implications for wind models and dependence on mass\n\nThese detections of the prevalence and properties of winds\nin starforming galaxies can constrain both the impact of winds\non galaxies and the IGM, and the physical models of the wind\nmechanism.\nSince the influential work of Larson (1974) it has been recognized that winds driven by supernovae could arise during\ngalaxy formation and limit its progress. Larson suggested that\nthese winds could cause more gas loss in smaller galaxies and\nexplain the mass-metallicity relation. Subsequent treatments\nhave emphasized the importance of winds for solving problems with low-mass galaxies in cold dark matter models of\nstructure formation, such as reducing the number, luminosity, and metallicity of faint galaxies (e.g. Dekel & Silk 1986;\nDekel & Woo 2003).\nHydrodynamical studies have shown that while it is relatively difficult for supernovae-driven outflows to clear lowmass galaxies entirely of gas, they can be fairly efficient\nat ejecting metals (De Young & Heckman 1994; Mac Low\n& Ferrara 1999). Star-formation driven winds are a necessary ingredient, under the name of \"feedback,\" for models\nof galaxy formation to reproduce observed scaling relations\n(e.g. Somerville & Primack 1999; Ceverino & Klypin 2007).\nMatching the observed radius, luminosity and velocity rela-\n\n21\n\ntions of disk galaxies requires that a large fraction of baryons\neither never make it into the disk or are blown out (Dutton et\nal. 2007).\nModels of winds have tended to concentrate on the effect\nof winds on low-mass galaxies, where the question of complete gas blowout is more pressing, and where outflows are\neffective at leaving fossil evidence in the mass-metallicity relation (Garnett 2002; Tremonti et al. 2004; Dalcanton 2007).\nStar-formation driven outflows do not leave a strong trace in\nthe metallicity of high-mass, low gas fraction galaxies, and\nso the mass-metallicity relation is not evidence against winds\nin high-mass galaxies (Dalcanton 2007). The baryonic TullyFisher relation does not show a break at low masses (Geha et\nal. 2006), as might be expected in models where winds are\neffective below a critical mass or circular velocity (e.g. Dekel\n& Silk 1986). Some models have predicted that the effect\nof winds is small in high-mass galaxies because the wind is\nblocked by gas within the disk (e.g. Dubois & Teyssier 2008;\nDalla Vecchia & Schaye 2008).\nBut in fact, high-velocity winds in high-mass, SFRdominated galaxies are demonstrated to exist in Lyman break\ngalaxies (Shapley et al. 2003), in LIRG/ULIRGs (Rupke et al.\n2005b; Martin 2005), and in blue-cloud starforming galaxies (this work). These could have significant effects on gas\ncontent, absorption-line systems, and the enrichment of the\nIGM and ICM, and so proper treatment of winds in high-mass\ngalaxies is necessary to model these problems. Although\nwinds probably have a stronger influence on the structure of\nlow-mass galaxies than on high-mass galaxies, this does not\ntell us whether low- or high-mass galaxies are more important\nfor IGM enrichment.\nThe behavior of winds in low and high mass galaxies is\nrelated to another theoretical problem, the appropriate physical model for the driving of the outflow. The cool gas in\nwinds may be driven either by the kinetic energy of supernova ejecta, by entrainment in the hot wind (e.g. Chevalier\n& Clegg 1985; Heckman et al. 1990; Strickland & Stevens\n2000) or by the momentum, through radiation pressure (Murray et al. 2005) or cosmic ray pressure (Socrates et al. 2006).\nThese predict different scalings for the behavior of wind velocity with galaxy mass and SFR.\nThe observed X-ray temperature of winds varies little with\ngalaxy mass, which would suggest relatively little dependence\nof cool gas velocity on galaxy mass (Martin 1999; Heckman\net al. 2000). As pointed out by Martin (2005), the increase\nof wind velocity with SFR, V \u223c SFR0.35 , which she finds\nin ULIRGs and we find across a broad range of starforming\ngalaxies, is surprising if winds are energy-driven (though see\nFujita et al. 2008). Momentum-driven winds appear to fit this\nscaling better (Murray et al. 2005), although a detailed comparison is beyond the scope of this paper.\nWe discuss one possible implication, the shape of the outflow absorption profile. In the momentum-driven wind model\nof Murray et al. (2005), cool gas is accelerated by radiation\npressure, predicting V 2 (r) = 4\u03c3h2 (L/LM \u2212 1)ln (r/r0 ), where\n\u03c3h is the halo velocity dispersion and LM is a critical luminosity to drive a wind. The radial dependence of the wind-driven\ncool gas density is not easy to predict, but it should decline\nwith radius, e.g. \u03c1 (r) \u223c r\u22122 to r\u22123 .\nFigure 17 shows a toy model of the absorption that such a\nwind might produce (upper panel) for \u03c3h = 150 km s\u22121 and a\n60% covering factor, to be compared with the Mg II outflow\n(lower panel). We have simply convolved the equations for\n\n\f22\n\nWeiner et al.\n\nF IG . 17.- Upper panel: Absorption profile predicted by a model in which\nthe gas is accelerated, with v(r) increasing and \u03c1 (r) decreasing (e.g. Murray\net al. 2005). The optical depth and covering factor have arbitrary normalization; the covering factor is 60%. The solid line is for \u03c1 \u221d r \u22122 and the dashed\nline for \u03c1 \u221d r \u22123 . This model can produce an asymmetric profile. Lower\npanel: Observed Mg II outflow component profile, velocity relative to 2795.5\n\u00c5, in the no excess emission sample, with an asymmetric tail to high outflow\nvelocity.\n\nV (r) and \u03c1 (r), assuming that the total covering factor is 60%\nand the absorption strength declines as \u03c1 (r) (lower covering\nfactor and/or optical depth as the gas spreads out to large radius). This model is by no means unique; the essential point\nis that a model in which the cool gas is accelerated as radius\nincreases, while its density declines with r, can naturally produce an asymmetric line profile with a tail of absorption to\nhigh velocities. This shape is similar to the composite spectrum and to the individual absorption lines we detect (Figure\n4). The model spectrum does not have gas at velocities as\nlarge as observed, which could be due to limitations of the\nmodel and our assumptions about \u03c3h and LM . This is not a\nunique model prediction; for example, low column density\nclouds might be accelerated to higher velocities (see Rupke\net al. 2005b), possibly producing a similar profile. Detailed\ncomparisons of wind models and the spectra should be a constraint on wind physics.\nWind velocities that increase with mass and SFR undermine\nsome of the assumptions in models of winds that emphasize\nblowout in low mass galaxies (e.g. Dekel & Silk 1986). Incorporating wind velocities that increase with mass (Vwind \u223c Vesc ,\nrather than constant Vwind ) into cosmological simulations does\na better job of reproducing the IGM enrichment and massmetallicity relation (Oppenheimer & Dav\u00e9 2006; Finlator &\nDav\u00e9 2008). Regardless of the energy vs. momentum-driven\ncontroversy, we find that indeed Vwind \u223c Vesc (Figures 15 and\n16), reinforcing that this is a better scaling to apply.\n7.5. Descendants of the DEEP2 sample\n\nWinds have previously been detected in low-redshift dwarf\nstarbursts and IR-luminous galaxies (e.g. Heckman et al.\n\n2000; Martin 2005; Rupke et al. 2005b), in z \u223c 0.6 luminous post-starbursts (Tremonti et al. 2007), and in z \u223c 3 Lyman break galaxies (Pettini et al. 2000; Shapley et al. 2003).\nA common feature of all but the dwarfs is that they have a\nhigh fraction of mergers or progenitors of ellipticals; in the\ncase of the z \u223c 3 galaxies this is based on their clustering\n(Adelberger et al. 2005). This leaves open the question of\nwhether winds were mostly associated with elliptical formation or were also part of the past of today's luminous nonstarburst spirals. Were outflows driven from massive galaxies\nonly in bursty events associated with mergers or quenching\nof star formation, or were they also driven during the relatively steady high-SFR mode that governs blue galaxies at\nz \u223c 1 (Noeske et al. 2007a)?\nThe DEEP2 Mg II sample shows that winds are common in\nthe blue cloud of star-forming galaxies at z \u223c 1.4. Although\nwe are only probing the brightest 1-1.5 mag of galaxies at a\ngiven U \u2212 B color, the sample spans a wide range of stellar\nmass and color, showing that winds occur even in low-mass\ngalaxies with M\u2217 < 1010 M\u2299 . These are well below the transition mass for quenching of star formation (Bundy et al. 2006)\nand are unlikely to evolve quickly onto the red sequence.\nBecause the DEEP2 Mg II sample is the high-redshift tip of\na classical magnitude-selected survey, we can trace the blue\npopulation down in redshift. The evolution of the blue cloud\nin DEEP2 suggests that most of the galaxies stay blue and\nfade as their SFR declines gradually (Blanton 2006; Willmer\net al. 2006; Faber et al. 2007; Noeske et al. 2007a). Some\nof the brightest blue galaxies may turn red; especially in\ndenser environments. At z > 1, some of the brightest blue\nDEEP2 galaxies are in dense environments (Cooper et al.\n2007), and from z = 1.3 to z = 1, the red fraction in DEEP2\ngroups increases (Gerke et al. 2007). It is likely that some\nof the z \u223c 1.4 DEEP2 blue galaxies will turn into ellipticals\nin groups. However, much of the sample is in the field; blue\ngalaxies in DEEP2 have high number density and much lower\nclustering than local early-type galaxies (Coil et al. 2008).\nThe combination of number density and clustering shows that\nmost of them will not evolve into local early-types, similar to\nthe argument made by Conroy et al. (2008) for the descendants of z \u223c 2 galaxies. Note also that of the galaxies with\nHST/ACS imaging, the merger fraction was very low, 3/118,\nwhile 50/118 were classified as face-on or inclined disky objects (Section 6.2).\nAn analysis of the clustering and number density of z \u223c 2\nstar-forming galaxies indicates that they will evolve mostly\ninto L\u2217 galaxies today, including many massive spirals and\nsome ellipticals (Conroy et al. 2008). The z \u223c 2 galaxies are\nroughly intermediate in properties and time between the z \u223c 3\nLyman break galaxies and the z \u223c 1.4 DEEP2 galaxies, reinforcing that the DEEP2 Mg II galaxies are most likely to turn\ninto massive spirals like the Milky Way. The lookback time\nto z = 1.4 is 9.0 Gyr, approximately the epoch at which the\nMilky Way thin disk begins to form (Edvardsson et al. 1993),\nwhich could plausibly be associated with a very high SFR.\nWe conclude that the prevalence of winds in the DEEP2\nz \u223c 1.4 sample shows that many L\u2217 galaxies, including spirals,\ndrove a wind during their early, high-SFR, formative phases.\nMost blue galaxies continue to form stars down to the present\nday, which implies that a strong SFR-driven wind does not\nprevent subsequent star formation.\nWinds, possibly from AGN, are a popular mechanism for\ntruncating or quenching further gas accretion and star for-\n\n\fOutflows from Star-Forming Galaxies\nmation during merger formation of spheroidal galaxies (e.g.\nSanders 1988; Cox et al. 2006; Tremonti et al. 2007). The\nphysics of how the energy source couples to the ISM to clear\nit from the galaxy are not well understood. Galaxy-scale simulations cannot resolve the AGN, and popular models incorporating AGN feedback (e.g. Hopkins et al. 2006) couple the\nAGN energy directly to the ISM, which could be unrealistically efficient.\nIt may be that AGN energy input, orbital energy from the\nmerger, or an extremely high SFR (effectively Eddington limited, as in Murray et al. 2005 or Socrates et al. 2006) can\nclear the ISM from the progenitors of ellipticals, but these\nhave yet to be proven. SFRs like those observed in the DEEP2\nz \u223c 1.4 sample, 10-50 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , do not appear to remove\nenough gas to deter subsequent star formation. There is evidence that radiation from QSOs heats and ionizes the IGM\nout to large distances, as seen in the proximity effect (shown\nfor metal lines by Wild et al. 2008), but also that the effect\nis anisotropic, weaker in the transverse direction (Hennawi\n& Prochaska 2007). The physics of QSOs ionizing the ISM\nor IGM absorbers are understood, but it is more difficult to\ncouple radiation to the gas to transfer momentum and cause\nblowout, which is a current weakness of the AGN quenching\nscenario.\n8. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have used 1406 spectra of blue star-forming galaxies\nat z \u223c 1.4 in the DEEP2 redshift survey to detect blueshifted\nMg II and Mg I absorption in the coadded spectrum, and in\na subset of the individual spectra that have high enough S/N.\nThe blueshifted Mg II absorption reaches a depth of 55%, indicating that large-scale wind-driven outflows in cool, lowionization gas exist in at least half of the galaxies. The convolution of frequency and covering fraction of outflows in lowredshift IR-luminous galaxies is \u223c 0.2 (Rupke et al. 2005b).\nThe 55% absorption in our sample suggests that in fact all\nof the z \u223c 1.4 star-forming galaxies are driving outflows, and\nthat the Mg II covering fraction is higher than seen in Na I in\nthe local IR-luminous galaxies.\nThe outflows are driven by star formation; about 50 of the\ngalaxies show narrow Mg II emission indicating AGN activity, but these have a similar outflow signature to the rest. The\noutflows show an asymmetric absorption profile with a tail\nto high velocities; the median of the absorption is \u223c \u2212250\nkm s\u22121 , with absorption at 10% depth out to \u223c \u2212500 km s\u22121 .\nIn the high stellar mass subsample, absorption is visible out\nto \u223c \u22121000 km s\u22121 .\nThe Mg II absorption is quite saturated and the overall covering fraction is large, given the 55% absorption trough. Applying the doublet ratio method to the Mg II doublet, we find\nthat the optical depth is \u223c 10 and the column density of the absorbers is NH \u223c 1020 , possibly even higher given the high optical depths. This implies that a typical luminous star-forming\ngalaxy at z = 1.4 is blowing out and covered by a sub-damped\nLyman-\u03b1 absorber.\nThe sample galaxies have SFRs of 10 \u2212 100 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , derived from UV fluxes and normalized to infrared luminosities; the median galaxy has LIR = 1.3 \u00d7 1011 L\u2299 . We find\nmass outflow rates of order 20 M\u2299 yr\u22121 using the measured\ncool gas outflow speed and column density, and a radius of at\nleast 5 kpc, about the optical size of the galaxies. The outflow\nrate is of the same order as the galaxies' star formation rate,\nin accord with local starburst wind galaxies and models of\n\n23\n\nhigh-redshift chemical evolution. Maintaining both high SFR\nand high outflow suggests that galaxies process gas relatively\nquickly and the rates are governed by infall (e.g. Heckman et\nal. 2000; Erb 2008). Substantial outflows can explain why the\nbaryon fraction in galaxy disks is lower than the global value.\nThe actual radius the outflows can reach is not known; it is\npossible that these outflows will give rise to Mg II absorption\nline systems at 20-50 kpc.\nWe divide the galaxies into subsamples by stellar mass,\ncolor, and star formation rate. We find strong blueshifted\nMg II absorption in all subsamples, across factors of \u223c 30 in\nstellar mass and \u223c 10 in SFR. For 118 of the galaxies, we have\nHST/ACS imaging and divide the galaxies into types including disks, irregulars and mergers. Again we find outflow absorption in all types. Nearly half of the galaxies are spirals and\nonly 3/118 are obvious mergers. This is distinct from wind\nsamples studied in absorption at lower redshifts, which tend\nto be either IR-luminous starbursts (Heckman et al. 2000),\nIR-luminous galaxies with a large merger fraction (Rupke et\nal. 2005b; Martin 2005), or post-starbursts (Tremonti et al.\n2007). The blue galaxy population has a high SFR across\nall luminous galaxies at z > 1 (Noeske et al. 2007a), rather\nthan high SFR confined to a small fraction of the objects, and\nthis places many of the blue galaxies at z \u223c 1.4 above the\nSFR > 0.1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 kpc\u22122 criterion for driving a wind that\nappears to hold in the local universe (Heckman 2002).\nThe Mg II outflow absorption is stronger and reaches to\nlarger velocities for high-stellar-mass, high-SFR galaxies.\nThe outflow velocity scales with SFR as Vwind \u223c SFR0.3 , similar to the scaling found by Martin (2005) in low-redshift\nULIRGs. The outflow velocity scales roughly as the galaxy\nescape velocities, which we derive from [O II] emission line\nvelocity widths. Although theoretical treatments of galactic winds have tended to emphasize their effect on low-mass\ngalaxies, the velocity scaling we find suggests that gas may\nbe able to escape from high-mass galaxies. A scaling relation of this type should be applied in theoretical models of\ngalaxy formation and IGM evolution (e.g. Finlator & Dav\u00e9\n2008). This velocity scaling may support momentum-driven\nwind models over energy-driven winds; further study of the\nwind models and the detailed absorption line profiles should\nyield insights into the wind physics.\nMost of these z \u223c 1.4 DEEP2 blue star-forming galaxies\nwill evolve into massive L\u2217 galaxies at z = 0, including many\nstar-forming spirals, although some fraction will turn into ellipticals. The prevalence of Mg II outflows in this DEEP2\nsample thus indicates that winds are not confined to mergers and elliptical progenitors; the progenitors of Milky Waytype galaxies drove winds in the past. Traces of these past\nwinds in high-mass galaxies are likely not visible in the massmetallicity relation (Dalcanton 2007), but they will have influenced the chemical evolution of the galaxies and the IGM.\nMost of the descendants of the blue star-forming galaxies\ncontinue to form stars, which implies that the winds in these\ngalaxies are not strong enough to clear the ISM and quench\nstar formation. Powerful winds during galaxy mergers are a\npopular mechanism for truncating gas accretion and star formation in red galaxies (e.g. Sanders 1988; Cox et al. 2006).\nThese invoke energy input from AGN, orbital energy of the\nmerger, or extremely high star formation rates. The details of\nhow the energy source couples to the ISM to clear it are not\nwell understood. We show that strong star-formation driven\nwinds do not deter subsequent star formation in the blue\n\n\f24\n\nWeiner et al.\n\ngalaxy population. Although star-formation driven winds are\nnot expected to clear their hosts' ISM based on their energetics, AGN-driven winds must be consistently stronger and very\nwell coupled to the ISM if they are to explain quenching. The\nphysics of the coupling are a difficult problem that must be\nunderstood to make wind quenching scenarios viable.\nWe are grateful to Christy Tremonti for inspiring this\nproject and much advice, and to Kristian Finlator, Romeel\nDav\u00e9, David Rupke, Sylvain Veilleux and Norman Murray for\nhelpful discussions.

We would like to use such a relation to infer stellar mass M\u2217 for galaxies that do not have K-band data nor\nstellar masses computed by Bundy et al. (2006). We should not directly apply the local relations (Bell & de Jong 2001; Bell et\nal. 2003) since higher-redshift galaxies have different star formation histories, so we empirically correct the color-M/L relations\nusing galaxies that do have K-band stellar masses.\nWe first compute the relation for M\u2217 /LB as a function of B \u2212 V for z = 0 galaxies (Bell et al. 2003):\nlog M/LB (z = 0) = \u22120.942 + 1.737 (B \u2212 VVega),\n\n(A1)\n\nfor a \"diet Salpeter\" IMF14 (Bell & de Jong 2001). MB and B \u2212 V are obtained by our K-correction methods.\nThis color-M/L relation could easily change with redshift. We calibrate the stellar masses by a least-squares fit of a correction\nterm CK between the color-M/L masses and the K-derived masses of Bundy et al. (2006). We fit to all 11924 galaxies with K\nand masses in 0 < z < 1.5, not just the Mg II sample, and find:\nM\u2217 = LB,Vega \u00d7 M/LB (z = 0) \u00d7 CK (U \u2212 B, z),\n\n(A2)\n\nlog CK (U \u2212 B, z) = \u22120.0244 \u2212 0.398 z + 0.105 (U \u2212 BVega).\n\n(A3)\n\nHere U \u2212 BVega = U \u2212 BAB \u2212 0.85 and B \u2212 VVega = B \u2212 VAB + 0.11. The scatter about the fit is 0.25 dex in stellar mass. This\nformula with CK applies to the entire DEEP2 sample over the range 0 < z < 1.5. There are systematic residual patterns with\ncolor and redshift of 0.1 dex (0-to-peak) in the mean, but this is less than the 0.3 dex rms scatter of individual galaxies about the\nrelation. Introducing second-order terms in U \u2212 B and z does not improve the residuals significantly.\nThe corrected stellar masses presented here are on the scale of Bundy et al. (2006), who used a Chabrier IMF. For the 1406galaxy Mg II sample, 409 have K magnitudes and masses from Bundy et al. (2006). Figure 9 compares the mass estimates\nfrom color-M/L to those from K-band, and demonstrates that there is a good correlation, although with significant scatter: the\ncolor-M/L masses are 0.09 dex lower with an RMS dispersion of 0.30 dex.\nREFERENCES\nAdelberger, K.L., Steidel, C.C., Pettini, M., Shapley, A.E., Reddy,\nN.A., & Erb, D.K. 2005, ApJ, 619, 697\nBell, E.F. 2002, ApJ, 577, 150\nBell, E.F., & de Jong, R.S. 2001, ApJ, 550, 212\nBell, E.F., McIntosh, D.H., Katz, N., & Weinberg, M.D. 2003, ApJS,\n149, 289\nBell, E.F., et al. 2005, ApJ, 625, 23\nBergeron, J., & Boiss\u00e9, P. 1991, A&A, 243, 344\nBertin, E., & Arnouts, S. 1996, A&AS, 117, 393\nBinney, J. & Tremaine, S. 1987, Galactic Dynamics (Princeton:\nPrinceton U.P.)\nBland, J., & Tully, B. 1988, Nature, 334, 43\nBlanton, M.R. 2006, ApJ, 648, 268\n\nBond, N.A., Churchill, C.W., Charlton, J.C., & Vogt, S.S. 2001, ApJ,\n562, 641\nBouch\u00e9, N., Murphy, M.T., P\u00e9roux, C., Csabai, I., & Wild, V. 2006,\nMNRAS, 371, 495\nBowen, D.V., Pettini, M., Penston, M.V., & Blades, C. 1991,\nMNRAS, 249, 145\nBowen, D.V., Blades, J.C., & Pettini, M. 1995, ApJ, 448, 634\nBruzual, G., & Charlot, S. 2003, MNRAS, 344, 1000\nBundy, K., et al. 2006, ApJ, 651, 120\nCeverino, D., & Klypin, A. 2007, arXiv:0712.3285\nCharlton, J.

In practice, for our sample, the main effect of different IMFs is to shift the zeropoints of\nmass or SFR due to a change in the ratio of high to low mass stars. SFR calibrations are often referenced to the Salpeter IMF (e.g. Kennicutt 1998) or sometimes\nKroupa (Bell et al. 2005), while stellar mass estimates often use somewhat lighter IMFs (Bell & de Jong 2001; Bundy et al. 2006).
