The realization of nonclassical states of\ndiscrete as well as continuous variables (CV) is often required as an off-line resource in protocols for quantum\ncomputation and communication. As an example, the\npreparation of Schr\u00f6dinger cat states of a CV system is\none of the key ingredients in the performance of coherent state quantum computation [1, 2]. Very recently,\nefficient proposals for the realization of Schr\u00f6dinger cat\nstates have been put forward [3]. On the other hand, an\nentangled coherent state of two field modes [4] serves as a\nquantum channel in the realization of teleportation-based\ncoherent state-quantum computation [5, 6]. In these last\nyears, the use of hybrid quantum registers made up of\nsystems having different nature (i.e. spanning Hilbert\nspaces of different dimensions) has been recognized to be\na useful way to improve the flexibility of a physical device. Both the manipulability and the robustness against\ndecoherence in computation and communication are often improved by a hybrid setup. Therefore, the necessity\nof performing quantum state engineering involving systems of different nature is raising increasing interest in\nthe QIP community.\nA usual requirement in the context of quantum state\nengineering of coherent states is the availability of efficient sources of nonlinear interactions. Unfortunately,\nthe current state of the art is such that only small nonlinear rates can be attained. This represents a big hindrance\nnot only for the creation of nonclassical states but also\nfor single-photon quantum computation. Ways to nearlydeterministically bypass this bottleneck have been envisaged with the simulation of nonlinear interaction by photodetection [7]. More recently, Munro and coworkers [8]\nshowed an efficient way to perform all-optical quantum\ncomputation using single photons by adopting the quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement technique us-\n\ning a low cross-Kerr nonlinearity and strong amplitude\ncoherent field.\nEven though this represents a major step forward in\nthe field of manipulating the state of travelling-light\nwaves, the proposal in [8] is not the only situation where\nthe use of nonlinearity-based QND can be successfully\nexploited. In cavity-quantum electrodynamics (cavityQED), a very similar technique involving a bosonic system in a coherent state and a fermionic system in a\ntwo-dimensional state has already been experimentally\ndemonstrated. In particular, Bertet et al. [9] measured\nthe Wigner distribution of a Fock state based on the theoretical proposals [10], which exploit cross-Kerr-based\nQND techniques and, very recently, Maioli et al. performed Rydberg atom counting based on QND measurement [11]. It is worth stressing that, differently from a\nrunning field, the nonlinearity rate achievable in cavityQED is large enough not to require exceedingly long interaction times or intense light fields.\nIn this paper, we investigate further on the use of crossKerr QND interactions by suggesting theoretical protocols for the implementation of effective quantum state engineering in a cavity-QED setup. In all the schemes suggested here, the synergy between two-level and infinite\ndimensional systems is the key element. We address explicitly the transfer of entanglement between subsystems\nof different nature, thoroughly analyzing the conditions\nfor the maximal transfer of entanglement. This results\nin the proposal for entanglement transfer from discrete\nto CV systems and the adaptation of the recently proposed protocol for entanglement reciprocation [12], which\nachieves a complete ebit of a two-qubit state starting\nfrom a CV entangled state. The inherently hybrid nature of the cross-Kerr interactions treated here allows us\nto design a simple scheme for entanglement swapping [13]\nbetween discrete and CV entangled states. The possibility of using the resulting state for building up effective\nquantum repeaters [14] for long-range communication is\nbriefly sketched.\n\n\f2\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.\nIn Section II we briefly describe the formal approach to\nthe interaction between an atom and a coherent state\nof a cavity field-mode at the basis of the effective crossKerr interaction. Section III is devoted to information\ntransfer, which serves as a basic building block to be\nused for the other tasks analized in our work. These are\nmainly entanglement transfer, approached in Section IV\nand entanglement reciprocation, which is the center of\nSection V. Section VI shows that the trasnfer and reciprocation scheme can be generalized in such a way that\nan initial entanglement corresponding to n ebits can be\nmutually exchanged between matter and light. Finally,\nin Section VII we fully exploit the hybrid nature of the\nQND model used here to suggest a suitably modified version of an entanglement swapping protocol. Section VIII\nremarks on the ingredients required in the physical implementation of our protocols and outlines our main results.\nII.\n\nINTERACTION MODEL\n\n1\n\u03b4(|eihe| \u2212 |gihg|) + \u03bb(\u00e2\u2020 |gihe| + \u00e2|eihg|),\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b4 = \u03c90 \u2212 \u03c9 denotes the detuning between the\ntwo-level atom and the cavity field. In the ordered atomic\nbasis he| = (1, 0), \u0012\nhg| = (0, 1),\u0013the time-evolution opera\u00db11 \u00db12\ntor \u00db = e\u2212i\u0124t =\nis given by the following\n\u00db21 \u00db22\nexplicit expression [15]\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u2212i\u03bb\u00e2 sin\u03a9\u0302\u03a9\u0302n t\ncos \u03a9\u0302n+1 t \u2212 i\u03b4 sin2\u03a9\u0302\u03a9\u0302n+1 t\nn+1\nn\n\uf8f8.\n\u00db = \uf8ed\ncos \u03a9\u0302n t + i\u03b4 sin2\u03a9\u0302\u03a9\u0302n t\n\u2212i\u03bb\u00e2\u2020 sin\u03a9\u0302\u03a9\u0302n+1 t\nn+1\n\nn\n\n(2)\nHere, we have introduced the effective Rabi frequency\n\u03a9\u0302n =\n\np\n(\u03b4 2 /4) + \u03bb2 n\u0302\n\n\u00db11 \u2248 e\u2212i\u03a9\u0302n+1 t ,\n\n(3)\n\nwith the photon-number operator n\u0302 = \u00e2\u2020 \u00e2. Inspired by\nthe idea of QND interactions [16], Brune et al. [17] proposed an experimental realization in cavity-QED using\nthe model whose evolution is described by Eq. (2). For\nthis purpose, a dispersive interaction characterized by a\n\n\u00db22 \u2248 ei\u03a9\u0302n t .\n\nIn order to better gather the explicit form of the effective\ntime-evolution operator, we consider the approximation\n2\n\u03a9\u0302n \u2248 2\u03b4 + \u03bb\u03b4 n\u0302 and move to a frame rotating at a frequency equal to the detuning \u03b4. In these conditions, the\nevolution operator Eq. (2) of the atom-field system becomes\n\u00dbr \u2261 e\u2212i\n\nIn this Section, we briefly describe how the cross-Kerr\neffect is achieved in a cavity-QED system. We consider a two-level atom with excited and ground states |ei\nand |gi respectively, interacting with a single-mode cavity field with bosonic annihilation (creation) operators \u00e2\n(\u00e2\u2020 ). The atomic transition frequency is \u03c90 and the frequency of the cavity field mode is \u03c9 while the interaction\nrate between the two subsystems is indicated by \u03bb. In\nthe interaction picture and under the rotating-wave and\nelectric dipole approximations, the Hamiltonian of the\nsystem is\n\n\u0124 =\n\nlarge detuning \u03b4 has been considered rather than a resonant one. These are exactly the sort of working conditions we want to adopt in this paper. Under the condition\n\u03b4 2 /4 \u226b \u03bb2 n\u0304, \u03bb2 \u2206n, where n\u0304 and \u2206n are respectively the\naverage photon number of the cavity field and the corresponding variance, the Rabi frequency is dominated by\nthe detuning and only the diagonal terms in Eq. (2) are\nnon-negligible, reading\n\n\u03bb2\n\u03b4\n\nt(n\u0302+1)\n\n|eihe| + ei\n\n\u03bb2\n\u03b4\n\ntn\u0302\n\n|gihg|\n\n(4)\n\nwhich clearly shows that no energy exchange between the\natom and the field occurs. Just the phase of the atomic\nstate changes depending on the intensity of the cavity\nfield mode. This is the key for the QND interaction not to\ndestroy the photon number during its measurement. This\nis in perfect analogy with the evolution operator for the\n\u2020\n\u2020\ncross-Kerr coupling \u00dbck = ei\u03bat\u00e2 \u00e2b\u0302 b\u0302 between two modes\na and b with the coupling strength \u03ba. A big technical\ndifference between these two models is that, while \u03bat is\nextremely small in current optical-fibers (frequently used\nin order to achieve photon-photon coupling, in runningwave configurations), \u03bb2 t/\u03b4 can be large large enough to\nguarantee an effectively large phase-shift within the decoherence time of the system at hand [17]. This is an\nimportant reason which makes the cavity-QED realization of QND attractive. Recently, based on this dispersive interaction between a field and an atom, Wang and\nDuan [18] proposed to engineer Schor\u00f6dinger cat states\nand Toscano et al. [19] suggested a Heisenberg-limited\nmeasurement of displacements and rotations.\nThroughout the paper, we assume that the cavity is\ninitially prepared with a coherent state |\u03b1i of amplitude \u03b1 \u2208 C which is routinely done, experimentally,\nby coupling an external coherent field with the cavity.\nAs a coherent state is a superposition of number states\n|\u03b1|2 P\u221e\n\u03b1n\n\u221a\nwith the Poissonian weight, |\u03b1i = e\u2212 2\nn=0 n! |ni,\napplying the evolution operator in Eq. (4) to the joint\nstate of discrete and CV systems for the interaction time\n\u03bb2 t/\u03b4 = \u03c0/2, we find that\n\u00db\n\n\u00db\n\n|ei|\u03b1i \u2212\u2192 \u2212i|ei| \u2212 i\u03b1i, |gi|\u03b1i \u2212\u2192 |gi|i\u03b1i,\n\n(5)\n\nwhich shows the conditional phase-shift achieved by the\ninitial coherent state. These transformations will be frequently used throughout this paper as the central ingredients of our protocols.\n\n\f3\nIII.\n\nINFORMATION TRANSFER\n\nBy rescaling the atomic energy in such a way that\nEg = 0, with Eg being the energy of the ground state of\neach atom, it is straightforward to see that the Hamiltonian of the system can be written so that the correspond\u03bb2\ning time-evolution operator reads \u00dbr = e\u22122i \u03b4 tn\u0302|eihe| .\nThis form of the coupling Hamiltonian, which has been\ndiscussed in many contexts of quantum optics and quantum information processing [6, 10], is here reinterpreted\nas the generalization of the Ising interaction between two\n1 2\nqubits. This latter has the structure \u00dbI = e\u2212i\u03c7\u03c3\u0302z \u03c3\u0302z ,\nwhere 1 and 2 are the labels for the two qubits, \u03c7 is\nthe interaction rate and \u03c3zj is the z-Pauli operator for\nqubit j = 1, 2. Evidently, neither \u00dbI nor \u00dbr describe an\neffective exchange of excitations between the subsystems\nthey involve. Just a conditional phase-shift is applied, as\na result of these two time-propagators, on the joint state\nof the two subsystems. As the Ising interaction is the basis of the theoretical approach to quantum information\nprocessing with cluster states [20], this formal reinterpretation paves the way toward an interesting analysis of the\nquantum state transfer, quantum entanglement transfer\nand entanglement reciprocation in terms analogous to\nthe mechanisms which rule the propagation and manipulation of information in a cluster state-based scenario.\nThe following discussion, which is taken from the general cluster state formalism [20, 21], serves as a building\nblock for the description of the information entanglement\ntransfer protocols with Eq. (4).\nIn order to transfer a (normalized) single-qubit quantum state, |\u03c8i = a|0i1 +b|1i1 of qubit 1 to qubit 2 (logical\nstates {|0i \u2261 |gi , |1i \u2261 |ei}j , j = 1, 2 and a, b \u2208 R, for\nsimplicity), we first prepare\n2 in the balanced superposi\u221a\ntion |+i = (|0i + |1i)/ 2. Then, we apply \u00dbI , which is\nequivalent to a control-phase operation that, for \u03c7 = \u03c0,\ngives a phase-flip only when both the qubits are in |1i.\nThe joint system is thus in the quantum state\n|\u03a8i12 = a|0, +i12 + b|1, \u2212i12 .\nBy performing\u221aa projective measurement on {|\u00b1i1 }\n(with |\u2212i1 = (1/ 2)(|0i \u2212 |1i)), the output state of 2 becomes a|+i2 \u00b1 b|\u2212i2 , corresponding to the measurement\noutcome \u00b1 respectively. Depending on the outcome of\nthe measurement, a conditional unitary operation on 2\nis applied, in order to retrieve perfectly the information\ninitially encoded in the state of qubit 1. For the outcome +, 1l has to be applied to qubit 2 while, for the\noutcome \u2212, the application of \u03c3\u0302x is required (where \u03c3\u0302x is\nthe x-Pauli operator). After these conditional correction\noperations, the state of 2 becomes a|+i + b|\u2212i. Notice\nthat the initial qubit is now encoded in the eigenstates\n|\u00b1i of \u03c3\u0302x rather than in the energy eigenstates. The\nconversion into this basis can be accomplished with the\napplication of a byproduct operator [20, 21] corresponding\nto a Hadamard transformation, which rotates the state\ninto the original basis {|0i, |1i}.\n\nIn complete analogy to the above discussion, a complete state transfer to a coherent state of the cavity field\ncan be accomplished, through \u00dbr in Eq. (4), by applying a modified version of the above protocol. The initial information-encoded qubit a |0i + b |1i is now allowed\nto interact with a coherent state of the cavity field |\u03b1i\nthrough Eq. (4) for an interaction time \u03bb2 t/\u03b4 = \u03c0/2,\nleading to the joint state\n1\n\u00dbr\n\u221a (a |gi |i\u03b1i \u2212 ib |ei |\u2212i\u03b1i). (6)\n(a |0i + b |1i) |\u03b1i \u2212\u2192\n2\nA projection of the qubit state\n\u221a onto the y-Pauli matrix \u03c3\u02c6y eigenstates |\u00b1iy = (1/ 2)(|gi \u00b1 i |ei) leads to\nthe state N+ (a |i\u03b1i \u2212 b |\u2212i\u03b1i) (for an outcome |+iy )\nor N\u2212 (a |i\u03b1i + b |\u2212i\u03b1i) (for an outcome |\u2212iy ), where\n2\n\nN\u00b1 = (1 \u00b1 2abe\u22122|\u03b1| )\u22121/2 . By remarking that, already\nfor |\u03b1| \u2265 2, hi\u03b1| \u2212 i\u03b1i \u2243 10\u22124 , the resulting states represent information-encoded quasi-qubit states. Differently\nfrom the case where the information-receiver was a qubit,\nin this instance the wrong relative phase appearing in\ncorrespondence to the |+iy outcome can be corrected by\napplying a z-rotation in the Hilbert space of the qubit\nspanned by {|i\u03b1i , |\u2212i\u03b1i}. This rotation can be formally\nperformed by exploiting the technique developed in [2, 6].\nIn our cavity-QED setup, we need the injection of an external, amplitude-controlled coherent state into the cavity, which can be done as explained in Ref. [17]. However,\nas our tasks are not related to quantum computation but\nto communication and information transfer, it is enough\nto assume here a conservative approach based on just the\npostselection of the events leading to the |\u2212iy outcomes.\nIV.\n\nENTANGLEMENT TRANSFER FROM\nATOMS TO CV\n\nThe basic principles described in the previous Section\ncan be adapted and exploited in order to transfer quantum correlations initially in a two-qubit state to the separable state of two cavity field-modes. The task is relevant\nand interesting as the creation of an entangled channel\nof a CV state is one of the focus points in quantum state\nengineering with CV. Recently, a considerable interest\nhas been directed toward the achievement of particular\nregimes of interaction between matter and light to be\nused for the purposes of generating entangled coherent\nstates [22]. On the other hand, here the approach is different as our task would be the transfer of correlations\nalready present in an ancillary state onto the joint state\nof a bipartite mode-field. Such a scenario is made possible by the ease with which entangled pairs of atoms can\nbe created in microwave cavity-QED, as reported in [23],\nwhere the entangling technique has been also extended\nto the generation of three-particle entanglement.\nWe consider two atoms, labelled as 1 and 2, in the max-\n\n\f4\n\n\u03b2\n\nfield-mode, we perform a measurement over the atomic\npart of |\u03a8(\u03c0/2)i by projecting\nit on the basis |\u00b1i1 |\u00b1i2\n\u221a\nwith |\u00b1ij = (|ei \u00b1 |gi)j / 2, (j = 1, 2). Ignoring the\nglobal phase of i, the output state of the two-mode field\nis given by\n\n\u2212 \u03c0\n\n2\n\n+/\u2212\n+/\u2212\n\u03b1\n\nN\u03b1,\u03b2,\u2212 (| \u2212 i\u03b1, \u2212i\u03b2i \u2212 |i\u03b1, i\u03b2i)\nN\u03b1,\u03b2,+ (| \u2212 i\u03b1, \u2212i\u03b2i + |i\u03b1, i\u03b2i)\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\nFIG. 1: Quantum circuit scheme of the protocol for entanglement transfer from a pair of entangled qubits to two initially\nseparable coherent states. The wave-line represents the entanglement initially between the qubits (inner lines). The\nsymbols for the conditional phase-shift gates implemented by\nthe cross-Kerr nonlinear interactions are shown with the corresponding phase-shift. We also include the atomic-state detectors (which perform projections onto the eigenstates of \u03c3\u0302x ).\n\nimally entangled state (generated as an off-line resource)\n1\n|\u03c8+ i12 = \u221a (|egi + |gei)12 .\n2\n\n(7)\n\nAs a receiving two-mode CV system we can consider either two separate single-mode microwave cavities or a\nsingle bimodal cavity. In the first situation, the protocol\nwe are going to describe works with two cross-Kerr interactions performed in parallel. The second configuration,\non the other hand, would imply a sequence of atomic\npassages. The atomic detunings can be set in such a way\nthat, if we label the field-modes as a and b, the effective\ninteraction configuration would involve the pairs (1, a)\nand (2, b), with the interaction being ruled by Eq. (4) for\neach pair. The initial state of the cavity fields is taken\nto be |\u03c8iab = |\u03b1, \u03b2iab so that the composite system is in\nthe state\n1\n|\u03a8i1a2b = \u221a (|e, \u03b1, g, \u03b2i + |g, \u03b1, e, \u03b2i)1a2b .\n2\n\n(8)\n\nIn what follows, \u03b4Af represents the atom-field detuning\nwith A = 1, 2 and f = a, b. The working conditions\nwe adopt here are such that, for a sequential passage of\natoms 1 and 2 through a bimodal cavity, |\u03b41b |, |\u03b42a | \u226b\n|\u03b42b | = |\u03b41a |. Obviously, this condition can be relaxed\nfor a parallel realization involving two separate cavities.\nThe atom-field interaction is arranged in order to satisfy\n2\n2\nthe evolution \u0108p1a \u2261 \u00dbr ( \u03bb\u03b41at = \u03c02 ) and \u0108p2b \u2020 = \u00dbr ( \u03bb\u03b42bt =\n\u2212 \u03c02 ), where the latter condition is possible by setting the\ndetuning \u03b42b < 0. The state of the composite system is\nthus given by\n\u0010 \u03c0 \u0011E\ni\n= \u221a (\u2212|e, \u2212i\u03b1, g, \u2212i\u03b2i + |g, i\u03b1, e, i\u03b2i) . (9)\n\u03a8\n2\n2\nThe information about the atomic state is now written\nonto the CV state. In order to extract just the state of the\n\nfor (\u00b1, \u00b1) (10)\nfor (\u00b1, \u2213). (11)\n\nwith N\u03b1,\u03b2,\u00b1 being proper normalization factors. For a\nlarge enough amplitude of the coherent states involved\nin Eqs. (10) and (11), these states manifestly show that\nentanglement is present. However, we wish to know\nwhether or not this entanglement is maximal, and so\nto establish the conditions for optimality of the entanglement transfer protocol, given that we started with an\ninitial atomic ebit. In the following analysis we thoroughly investigate the conditions under which an ebit is\nencoded in a two-mode entangled coherent state.\nA.\n\nComplete ebit for an entangled coherent state\n\nFor simplicity of the argument, let us assume two\nmodes having the same amplitude \u03b3 \u2261 i\u03b1 = i\u03b2 with\n\u03b3 real. The states (10) and (11) are then simply\n1\np\n(| \u2212 \u03b3i| \u2212 \u03b3i \u2212 |\u03b3i|\u03b3i)\n2(1 \u2212 e\u22124\u03b3 2 )\n1\np\n(| \u2212 \u03b3i| \u2212 \u03b3i + |\u03b3i|\u03b3i).\n2(1 + e\u22124\u03b3 2 )\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\nWe find that the probability of getting the (+, +) or\n2\n(\u2212, \u2212) outcome is P++ = P\u2212\u2212 = 14 (1 \u2212 e\u22124\u03b3 ) and\nthat of getting the (+, \u2212) or (\u2212, +) outcome is P+\u2212 =\n2\nP\u2212+ = 41 (1 + e\u22124\u03b3 ). Let us consider two orthogonal\nbases |\u03c6i = N\u03c6 (|\u03b3i + | \u2212 \u03b3i) and |\u03c8i = N\u03c8 (|\u03b3i \u2212 | \u2212 \u03b3i).\nIt is straightforward to see that, for the measurement\nevents (\u00b1, \u00b1), the field modes (12) can be written in the\nform\n1\n\u221a (|\u03c6i|\u03c8i + |\u03c8i|\u03c6i),\n2\n\n(14)\n\nwhich is a maximally entangled qubit state. We can get\nthis maximally entangled state with probability 2P++ .\nHowever, it is not possible to find an effective orthonormal qubit basis such that the state (13) is written as a\nmaximally entangled state. Indeed, by using the same\northonormal basis exploited above, we get that Eq. (13)\ncan be reduced to the form\n1\nq\n(N\u03c82 |\u03c6i |\u03c6i + N\u03c62 |\u03c8i |\u03c8i)\nN\u03c64 + N\u03c84\n2\n\n1\n\n(15)\n2\n\n1\n\nwith N\u03c6 = [2(1 + e\u22122\u03b3 )]\u2212 2 and N\u03c8 = [2(1 \u2212 e\u22122\u03b3 )]\u2212 2 .\nThe von Neumann entropy (VNE) can be used as a measure of the entanglement in this pure effective two-qubit\n\n\f5\nstate. It is straightforward to see that VNE approaches\nunity for a large enough amplitude of the coherent state\ncomponent of Eq. (13) whereas (12) carries one ebit regardless of \u03b1.\nMore generally, the condition to assign a complete ebit\nfor an entangled coherent state can be written as follows.\nA coherent superposition of a field mode f = a, b is\n|\u03c8if = a|\u03b1if + b|\u03b2if .\n\n(16)\n\nThe state may be described in a two-dimensional Hilbert\nspace, spanned by {|\u03b1if , |\u03b2if }. The coherent states are\nmutually nonorthogonal and one can find an orthonormal\nbasis [24] such as\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 \u2212i\u03c6f /2\n|\u03c8+ if = p\ne\ncos \u03b8f |\u03b1if \u2212 ei\u03c6f /2 sin \u03b8f |\u03b2if ,\nNf\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 \u2212i\u03c6f /2\n|\u03c8\u2212 if = p\n\u2212e\nsin \u03b8f |\u03b1if + ei\u03c6f /2 cos \u03b8f |\u03b2if ,\nNf\n(17)\nwhere Nf = cos(2\u03b8f ), sin(2\u03b8f ) = |f h\u03b1|\u03b2if | and\nexp[\u2212i\u03c6f ] =f h\u03b1|\u03b2if /|f h\u03b1|\u03b2if |. By inverting the above\nrelations, the coherent states can be written as\n|\u03b1if = ei\u03c6f /2 cos \u03b8f |\u03c8+ i + ei\u03c6f /2 sin \u03b8f |\u03c8\u2212 i,\n\n|\u03b2if = e\u2212i\u03c6f /2 sin \u03b8f |\u03c8+ i + e\u2212i\u03c6f /2 cos \u03b8f |\u03c8\u2212 i.\n\n(18)\n\nSuppose that we have an entangled coherent state,\n|\u03a6i \u2261 |\u03b1, \u03b1iab + ei\u03c8 |\u03b2, \u03b2iab ,\n\n(19)\n\nneglecting the normalization. This pure state carries one\nebit of entanglement if Trb (|\u03a6ih\u03a6|) \u221d 11. Here Trf stands\nfor the partial trace over the two-dimensional Hilbert\nspace of the mode f . This condition is equivalent to\nsin 2\u03b8a = sin 2\u03b8b ,\n\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c6a \u2212 \u03c6b = (2n + 1)\u03c0,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere n \u2208 Z. For a state like \u03a6\u0304 = | \u2212 i\u03b1, \u2212i\u03b1iab +\ne\u03c8 |i\u03b1, i\u03b1iab , we have \u03b8a = \u03b8b and \u03c6a = \u03c6b = 0. Therefore, the condition that the entangled coherent state has\none ebit is reduced to \u03c8 = (2n + 1)\u03c0. More generally, a\nstate having the form |\u03a6\u2032 i = |\u03b1, \u03b2iab + ei\u03c8 |\u03b2, \u03b1iab caries\none ebit if \u03c8 = 2\u03c6+(2n+1)\u03c0, where e\u2212i\u03c6 = h\u03b1|\u03b2i/|h\u03b1|\u03b2i|.\nThe above analysis shows that the postselection of the\natomic detection events (\u00b1, \u00b1) allows us to achieve the\noptimal performance of the entanglement transfer protocol. The initial atomic ebit is converted, by a process\ninvolving cross-Kerr-based QND interactions and orthogonal projection of qubit states, to an entangled coherent\nstate carrying exactly one ebit.\n\n\u2212 \u03c0\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n+/\u2212 \u03b1\n\nH\n\n\u03c3x\n\nH\n\n\u03c3x\n\u03c0\n2\n\n+/\u2212 \u03b2\n\nFIG. 2: Quantum circuit scheme of the protocol for entanglement reciprocation between an entangled coherent state\nof two modes (outer lines connected by the wavy line) and\ntwo initially separable qubits. A complete ebit can be transferred from the field modes to the qubits. The symbols for\nthe Hadamard gates and the conditional phase-shift gates implemented by the cross-Kerr nonlinear interactions are shown\n(these latter with the corresponding phase-shift). We also\ninclude the field-state detectors (which should discriminate\nbetween \u00b1\u03be with \u03be = \u03b1, \u03b2). Finally, some operations (in the\nform of \u03c3\u0302x rotations) are required, conditioned on the result\nof the field measurements and some classical communication.\n\nvariable to the joint state of two CV subsystems. The\nopposite process, which should allow the retrieval of the\nqubit entanglement, is denominated entanglement reciprocation [12]. In the context of Ref. [12], it has been\nshown that a full ebit can be reciprocated to and from a\nCV state through the use of a resonant atom-field interaction and appropriate postselection processes. Here we\nextend these results to the case of the dispersive model\nwe use and show that a full reciprocation mechanism is\npossible for a cross-Kerr interaction. On one hand, this\nanalysis allows us to stress the flexibility of the cross-Kerr\ninteractions in the context of quantum state engineering.\nOn the other hand, the results of this investigation relieve the entanglement reciprocation mechanism from the\nspecific interaction model considered in [12], showing its\neffectiveness for other, non-resonant interaction Hamiltonians. Once again, the basic building block will be\nthe use of cross-Kerr interaction in effective information\ntransfer processes.\nIn order to reciprocate the entanglement contained in\na CV channel (such as an entangled coherent state) to\ntwo initially separable atoms, we consider a procedure\nentirely similar to the qubit\u2192CV entanglement transfer.\nWe suppose the fields are in a state equivalent to Eq. (10)\nwhich, as we have already remarked in Section IV A, contains exactly one ebit, and we prepare two atoms in the\nproduct state of two \u03c3\u0302x eigenstates\n|\u03c8i12 = |+, +i12 .\n\nV.\n\nENTANGLEMENT RECIPROCATION FROM\nCV TO ATOMS\n\nIn the previous Section, we have described a protocol to transfer an ebit of entanglement from a discrete\n\n(21)\n\nNow the state of the composite system is given by\n|\u03a8i1a2b \u221d (|+, \u2212i\u03b1, +, \u2212i\u03b2i \u2212 |+, i\u03b1, +, i\u03b2i)1a2b . (22)\nThe next step is the application of an effective \u0108p\u2020 gate\nto the pair (1, a), while \u0108p is applied to the atom-field\n\n\f6\n|\u03c8i12 . Analytically, we find\n\nsubsystem (2, b). The state becomes\n|\u03a8i \u221d [(\u2212|e, ei + |g, gi) (| \u2212 \u03b1, \u03b2i \u2212 |\u03b1, \u2212\u03b2i)\n+i (|e, gi + |g, ei) (|\u03b1, \u03b2i \u2212 | \u2212 \u03b1, \u2212\u03b2i)] .\n\n(23)\n\nIn order to disentangle the CV state from the qubit\nstate we perform a measurement of the field modes by\nprojecting them onto {| \u00b1 \u03b1i} and {| \u00b1 \u03b2i}. If the phase\nof both the fields is the same, the atoms are projected\nonto the maximally entangled state Eq. (7). On the other\nhand, if the phases are different, a conditional unitary operation \u03c3\u0302y on the second atom has to be applied in order\nto retrieve the form (7). Here we assume a measurement\nthat can perfectly discriminate the states {| \u00b1 \u03b1i} and\n{| \u00b1 \u03b2i}). While an effective procedure which can implement such a measurement is briefly described in the next\nSection, here we stress that the efficiency of this scheme\nobviously depends on the measurements performed on\nthe field modes, whose success probability depends on\nthe magnitudes of \u03b1 and \u03b2. If |\u03b1| \u226b 1 and |\u03b2| \u226b 1,\nthe success probability approaches unity. Correspondingly, the final atomic state will be pure and carry one\nebit. Otherwise, if the success probability is smaller, the\ncorresponding atomic state is mixed and only partially\nentangled. In order to quantify the efficiency of the protocol and its resilience against this sort of imperfection,\nwe exemplify the results of a protocol where {|\u03b1i , |\u03b2i}\nare measured. The other cases can be treated in a manner equivalent to the approach we are going to describe.\nWe model the measurement as a projection of the\nstate (23) performed by the operator\nZ\nZ\n\u03a0\u0302a \u2297 \u03a0\u0302b = d\u03b3 d\u03b4 |\u03b3ia h\u03b3| \u2297 |\u03b4ib h\u03b4| G\u03b3 (\u2206, \u03b1)G\u03b4 (\u2206, \u03b2),\n\n(24)\nwhere G\u03bc (\u2206, \u03c7) (\u03bc = \u03b3, \u03b4 and \u03c7 = \u03b1, \u03b2) are proper (normalized) weighting function centered on \u03c7 and having\nwidth \u2206. This model accounts for the detection of a\ncoherent state which is not exactly the state we would\nlike to detect. For the sake of simplicity, we can assume each weigthing function to be a normalized Gaus(\u03bc\u2212\u03c7)2\n\n1\ne\u2212 2\u2206 . It is obvious, however,\nsian G\u03bc (\u2206, \u03c7) = \u221a2\u03c0\u2206\nthat the model (24) is independent of the actual choice\nfor these functions.\nIt is straightforward to prove that the normalized conditioned qubit density matrix, after the detection event,\nis given by\n\n\u03c112 =\n\n1\n[P1 |\u03c6\u2212 i12 h\u03c6\u2212 | + P2 |\u03c8+ i12 h\u03c8+ |\nP1 + P2\n\u2212 iP3 (|\u03c6\u2212 i12 h\u03c8+ | \u2212 |\u03c8+ i12 h\u03c6\u2212 |)]\n\n(25)\n\n\u221a\nwhere\n\u221a |\u03c6\u2212 i12 = (1/ 2)(|ggi \u2212 |eei)12 , |\u03c8+ i12 =\n(1/ 2)(|gei + |egi)12 and Pj (j = 1, 2, 3) are real functions depending on the overlaps h\u00b1\u03b1|\u03b3i and h\u00b1\u03b2|\u03b4i (for\ndefiniteness we assume here \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 R).

The corresponding state is extremely close to |\u03c8+ i12 , as shown\nby a fidelity-based analysis.\nVI. ENTANGLEMENT TRANSFER TO CV\nFROM MULTIPLE ENTANGLED ATOMIC\nPAIRS AND RECIPROCATION\n\nThe entanglement transfer and reciprocation schemes\ndiscussed in this paper can be easily extended to a multiple set of entangled atomic pairs. The trick is simply\nto make successive pairs of entangled atoms interact with\ntheir respective cavity fields for distinct amounts of time.\nWe start by representing the joint entangled state of n\natoms as\n|\u03a8i12 =\n\n|\u03c8+ i\u2297n\n12\n\n=\n\n1\n2n/2\n\nn\n2X\n\u22121\n\nx=0\n\n|x, xc i12 ,\n\n(27)\n\n\f7\nwhere we have used the labeling |ei = |0i, |gi = |1i, and\nx = x1 x2 ...xn and xc = xc1 xc2 ...xcn are binary numbers. If\nwe start with the cavity fields in |\u03b1ia and |\u03b1ib , and make\neach pair of atoms interact with the cavity fields for half\nthe time as the previous one in succession, we can obtain\nthe state\n|\u03a8(t)i12,ab =\n\nn\n2X\n\u22121\n\nx=0\n\n|x, xc i12 |\u03b1(x)ia |\u03b1(xc )ib ,\n\na\n\nb\n2\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\nHomodyne\n\n0/1\n\n(28)\n\n1\n\ni\u03c0(x1 /2+x2 /4+...+xn /2n )\n\nwhere \u03b1(x) = \u03b1e\n. Next all the\natoms are measured in the |\u00b1i basis. Say the outcome is\n\u2297n\n|+i\u2297n\n1 |+i2 . Then the cavities are projected to the state\n|\u03a8(t)iab =\n\nn\n2X\n\u22121\n\nx=0\n\n|\u03b1(x)ia |\u03b1(xc )ib .\n\n(29)\n\nIf \u03b1 \u226b 1/ sin(\u03c0/2n ), then the above is a 2n \u00d7 2n dimensional maximally entangled state. In other words\nall the entanglement of the initial n-ebits stored in the\natomic states have been transferred to the fields. All\nthe other outcomes also give the same type of entangled state apart from different relative signs between\nthe superposed components in |\u03a8(t)iab . For reciprocation of the entanglement back to the atoms, a set of\nn atoms in each cavity are first prepared in the state\nP2n \u22121\nP2n \u22121\n\u2297n\n|+i\u2297n\n\u2261 ( x=0 |xi1 )( x=0 |xi2 ). The previ1 |+i2\nous pattern of interactions is now repeated, but with\nopposite sign of the interaction (this can be achieved\nby a |ei \u2194 |gi followed by the original interaction).\nP2n \u22121\nOnly for the term\n|x, xc i12 in the expansion of\nP2n \u22121\nP2n \u22121 x=0\n( x=0 |xi1 )( x=0 |xi2 ), both cavity fields are going\nto return to their original state |\u03b1ia \u2297 |\u03b1ib . Thus by\nmeasuring the cavity fields, and obtaining the outcome\n|\u03b1ia \u2297 |\u03b1ib (again assuming \u03b1 \u226b 1/ sin(\u03c0/2n ), so that\nthis measurement is nearly one to an orthogonal basis),\none projects the atoms to the n pairs of ebits entangled\nstate |\u03a8i12 . Thus the full amount of entanglement can\nbe reciprocated conditional on an appropriate outcome.\n\nVII.\n\nENTANGLEMENT SWAPPING\n\nLet us suppose that a two-mode entangled coherent\nstate of the form N\u03b1,\u03b1,\u2212 (|\u03b1i |\u03b1i \u2212 |\u2212\u03b1i |\u2212\u03b1i)a,b has been\ncreated (for instance through the scheme described in\nSection IV) between modes a and b. On the other hand,\nwe assume we have at our disposal a maximally entangled\nqubit state, of the form in Eq. (7), of qubits 1 and 2. The\njoint state will read\nN\u03b1,\u03b1,\u2212\n\u221a (|e, \u03b1, g, \u03b1i \u2212 |e, \u2212\u03b1, g, \u2212\u03b1i\n2\n+ |g, \u03b1, e, \u03b1i \u2212 |g, \u2212\u03b1, e, \u2212\u03b1i)1,a,2,b .\n\n(30)\n\nFIG. 4: Quantum circuit scheme of the protocol for entanglement swapping. The wavy lines represent the entanglement\ninitially present in the bipartite state of modes a and b and\nbetween the qubits 1 and 2. We also show the symbol for\nthe conditional phase gate between atom 2 and mode b. The\nswapping process is completed by the measurement of these\ntwo subsystems. The measurement of mode b, in particular,\nis performed by a homodyne detection scheme as described in\nthe body of the paper.\n\nWe arrange a \u0108p \u2261 \u00dbr (\u03c0/2) interaction between qubit 2\nand mode b which will change the state above into\nN\u03b1,\u03b1,\u2212\n\u221a (|e, \u03b1, g, i\u03b1i \u2212 |e, \u2212\u03b1, g, \u2212i\u03b1i\n2\n\u2212 i |g, \u03b1, e, \u2212i\u03b1i + i |g, \u2212\u03b1, e, i\u03b1i)1,a,2,b .\n\n(31)\n\nA homodyne detection discriminating between the different possible phases of mode b will project Eq. (31)\nonto either (|e, \u03b1, gi + i |g, \u2212\u03b1, ei)1,a,2 or (|e, \u2212\u03b1, gi \u2212\ni |g, \u03b1, ei)1,a,2 . Then, a measurement of qubit 2 on the\neigenbasis of \u03c3\u0302y2 projects these states onto superpositions\nwhich can be always reconducted (through local atomic\nunitaries) to the prototypical form\n1\n\u221a (|g, \u03b1i + |e, \u2212\u03b1i).\n2\n\n(32)\n\nThe state in Eq. (32) falls into the category of states\nwhich can be represented by the general relation |g, \u03b1i +\ne, ei\u03c6 \u03b1 with \u03c6 \u2208 [0, \u03c0]. The entanglement in this class\nof states has been studied in detail in Ref. [25]. It is\npossible to show that, for \u03c6 = \u03c0 and |\u03b1| \u2265 2, the von\nNeumann entropy corresponding to the state (32) is exactly one ebit. This implies that, under these conditions,\nEq. (32) represents a maximally entangled state, therefore implying that the entanglement swapping procedure\nimplemented by the scheme presented here is complete.\nThe homodyning of the cavity field-mode b can be performed by injecting an external coherent state of amplitude i\u03b1 into the cavity. This will add to the pre-existent\ncoherent state in such a way that either the state |0ib or\n|2i\u03b1ib is obtained. Then a resonant interaction lasting\nfor a rescaled interaction time \u03c0 with an ancillary atom\nprepared in its ground state |gi is required. If the fieldmode was in its vacuum state, the probability of finding\nthe atom in |gi will be strictly 1. On the other hand,\n\n\f8\nfor a large enough |\u03b1|, such a probability is smaller (being still non-zero because of the overlap between |0i and\na coherent state), allowing for the discrimination of the\nphase of the cavity field.\nThe realization of the hybrid quantum channel in\nEq. (32) can find application in the realization of quantum repeaters [14] between cavity modes. Suppose, indeed, that the atomic flying qubit interacts with another\ncavity field-mode c of an independent cavity. The task is\nthe realization of an entangled channel of modes a and\nc which allows for long-haul quantum communication.\nThe state transfer procedure described in Section III can\nbe used in order to achieve such a result and create a\ntwo-mode coherent entangled state of a and c. The realization of this scheme requires the passage of a single\natom through multiple cavities, which is foreseeable with\npresent state of the art microwave cavity-QED technology [26].\nVIII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have addressed the problem of quantum state engineering with cross-Kerr nonlinearities implemented in a\n\n[1] S.
