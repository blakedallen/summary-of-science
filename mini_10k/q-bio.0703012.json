Rako\u010devi\u0107\nDepartment of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Nis;\nHome address: Milutina Milankovica 118, Belgrade: 11070, Serbia\n(E-mail: m.m.r@eunet.yu ; www.sponce.net)\nAbstract\nIn this paper it is shown that within a Combined Genetic Code Table, realized through a\ncombination of Watson-Crick Table and Codon Path Cube it exists, without an exception, a strict\ndistinction between two classes of enzymes aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, corresponding two\nclasses of amino acids and belonging codons. By this, the distinction itself is followed by a strict\nbalance of atom number within two subclasses of class I as well as two subclasses of class II of\namino acids.\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\nAmong the representations of the genetic code, two retain our attention here:\nthe Watson-Crick Table, WCT (the standard genetic code Table) (Watson &\nCrick., 1953a,b; Crick, 1966, 1968), arranged through an ordering of codon\nletters that shows the 1st /2nd/ 3rd letters in the order UCAG/ UCAG/ UCAG\n(first permutation in Table 1), and the so-called Codon Path Cube, CPC\n(Swanson, 1984) with the order UCGA/UCGA/CUAG (second and third\npermutations in Table 1, respectively).\nOn the other hand, Wetzel (1995) has shown that a strict distinction of\ncanonical amino acids (AAs) within the WCT in correspondence with two\nclasses (I & II) of enzymes aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) is valid only for\nthe XUX-XCX, but not for the XAX-XGX codon space1. Thus, as the AAs,\nhandled by class I of aaRS within the XUX-XCX space, appear V, M, I, L\nwhereas the AAs, handled by class II of aaRS are F, S, P, T, A. [Eriani et al.,\n1995, p 499: \"The class I enzymes chare with dehydrogenases and kinases the\nclassic nucleotide binding fold called the Rossmann fold, whereas the class II\nenzymes possess a different fold, not found elsewhere, built around a six1\n\nWetzel, 1995, p. 545: \"all XCX codons code for amino acids handled by class II synthetases,\nand all but one of the XUX codons code for amino acids handled by class I synthetases\"; cf. also\nFig. 1 in the cited work on the page 546.\n\n1\n\n\fstranded antiparallel beta-sheet. The two classes of synthetases ... differ as to\nwhere on the terminal adenosine of the tRNA the amino acid is placed: class I\nenzymes act on the 2\u2032 hydroxyl whereas the class II enzymes prefer the 3\u2032\nhydroxyl group\". (My italics and my comment: the C atom on the position 2\u2032 is a\nstronger nucleophile whereas the C atom on the position 3\u2032 is a less strong\nnucleophile).]\n1 UCAG/GACU 4\n2 UCGA/AGCU 3\n3 CUAG/GAUC 2\n4 CUGA/AGUC 1\n1 UACG/GCAU\n\n4\n\n2 UAGC/CGAU\n\n3\n\n3 AUCG/GCUA\n\n2\n\n4 AUGC/CGUA\n\n1\n\n1 UGCA/ACGU 4\n2 UGAC/CAGU 3\n3 GUCA/ACUG 2\n4 GUAC/CAUG 1\n\nTable 1 The 12+12 permutations of the sequence of four amino bases, two of pyrimidine (Py)\nand two of purine (Pu) type, arranged through three octets, in accordance to three main\ncharacteristics (footnote 4) of amino bases. Only first three permutations are included in CT.\n\nIt is also shown (Rako\u010devi\u0107, 1997a,b) that within the CPC (Figure 1 in\nRako\u010devi\u0107, 1997a) the mentioned distinction is valid for the whole XUX-XCXXAX-XGX codon space, with only one exception. Namely, within space I there\nare AAs: M, I, V, L, Y, Q, E, C, W and pyrimidine-coding arginine R, all\nhandled by class I of aaRS, and within space II: F, S, P, A, T, G, K, N, D, H, all\nhandled by class II, and purine-coding arginine R, handled by class I of aaRS.\nIn this paper, however, we show that within a Combined Genetic Code Table\n(CT), combined in a specific manner from the WCT and the CPC (Table 2 in\n\n2\n\n\frelation to Table 3), the strict distribution of the AAs over the two classes of\naaRS occurs without an exception.\n\n2nd\nletter\n\n1st letter\n\n3rd\nletter\n\nA\nG\n\nG\nA\n\nC\nC\n\nU\nU\n\nAAC\nN\nAAU\nAAA\nAAG K\n\nGAC\nD\nGAU\nGAA\nGAG E\n\nCAC\nH\nCAU\nCAA\nCAG Q\n\nUAC\nUAU Y\nUAA\nUAG *\n\nC\nU\nA\nG\n\nGGA\nGGG\n\nAGA\nAGG R\n\nCGA\nCGG\n\nA\nG\n\nGGC\nGGU\n\nAGC\nAGU S\n\nCGC\nCGU\n\nUGA *\nUGG\nW\nUGC\nUGU C\n\nC\n\nGCA\nGCG\nA\nGCC\nGCU\n\nACA\nACG\nT\nACC\nACU\n\nCCA\nCCG\nP\nCCC\nCCU\n\nUCA\nUCG\nS\nUCC\nUCU\n\nA\nG\nC\nU\n\nU\n\nAUC\nAUU I\nAUA\nAUG M\n\nGUC\nGUU\nV\nGUA\nGUG\n\nCUC\nCUU\nL\nCUA\nCUG\n\nUUC\nUUU F\nUUA\nUUG L\n\nC\nU\nA\nG\n\nA\nG\n\nC\nC\n\nU\nU\n\n3rd\nletter\n\nA\n\nG\n\n2nd\nletter\n\nR\n\nG\n\nG\nA\n\n1st letter\n\nC\nU\n\nTable 2.

(About relationships between Table 2 & 3, see in Discussion.)\n\n4\n\n\fThe first subclass of class I (1 in Table 4) is very down in Table 2 and the\nsecond one (1' in Table 4) in the top, on the right. On the other hand, the first\nsubclass of class II (2 in Table 4) is in a middle space (below in Table 2) whereas\nthe second one is above on the left (2' in Table 4).\n1\n\n11 + 39 + 40 + 78 = 168\nM + I + V + L = (4)\n\n2\n\n32 + 16 + 32 + 20 + 28 = 128\nT + A + P + S + F = (5)\n\n2' 16 + 14 + 22 + 30 + 10 + 04 = 096\nN + D + H + K + S + G = (6)\n1' 30 + 22 + 20 + 34 + 68 + 10 + 18 = 202\nY + Q + E + R + R + C + W = (7)\nTable 4.

By this one must notice the\nsituation R + R (meaning that R occurs two times) in row 1' because arginine\npossesses two spaces within the WCT; and the situation with only one L in row 1\nbecause Leucine possesses only one space (through six neighbor codons) within\nthe same Table. Certainly, serine also must appear two times (S in space \"C\" in\nrow 2 and S in space \"G\" in row 2') in accordance with its two spaces within the\nWCT2.\nIn addition, this CT shows the existence of a strict balance of the number of\natoms within the amino acid molecules (their side chains) according to the\nprinciple of minimum change (Table 4 in relation to Surveys 2 & 3). As it will be\nshown below, the word is about the changes exactly for \u00b10 or \u00b11 of atoms in\nrelation to arithmetic mean for two and two amino acid subclasses.\nTogether with all these balances, there is a balance of the number of\nmolecules: 1+1' = 2+2', i.e. 4+7 = 5+6 (where the principle of minimum change\nis also valid through the sequence of the 4-5-6-7).\n2\nIn contrary, in Shcherbak's nucleon number balance between four-codon and non-four-codon\namino acids (Shcherbak, 1994; 2003) Leucine possesses two positions too, because it is\ndistributed into two four-codon families. This fact affirms a conclusion that multi-meaning states\nare from the inherent characteristics for the genetic code.\n\n6\n\n\fSurvey 3.

The atom number balances within WCT after first-third-letter codon position rule\n(Siemion & Siemion, 1994) expressed through the number of atoms within amino acid molecules\n(side chains). First column (I-III) designates the type of the base in first-third position of\ncorresponding codons. The letters U, C, A, G are related to four columns in WCT. Within two\ninner and two outer rows as well as within two first and two second columns there are (8 x 33),\n[(9 x 33)\u00b11], and (10 x 33) of atoms, respectively.\n\nFrom Survey 2 it follows that the differences in the number of the atoms\nwithin amino acid subclasses 1' and 2 (202-128) equals 73+1 and within\nsubclasses 1 and 2' (168-96) equals 73 \u20131 or, in other words, both in relation to\narithmetic mean 73\u00b11. On the other hand, the sums of the atoms within two and\ntwo types of nucleotide molecules equal as follows; in first case: CMP + GMP =\n72+1 and UMP + AMP = 72 \u20131, or, both in relation to arithmetic mean 72\u00b11;\nand in second case: CMP + AMP = 72\u00b10 and UMP + GMP = 72\u00b10, or, both in\nrelation to arithmetic mean 72\u00b10.\nIn Survey 3 are presented some new balances from which it follows that the\ndistribution into 8 x 33; 9 x 33 (\u00b11) and 10 x 33 of atoms appears to be the same\nas in Py/Pu distinction within WCT from the aspect of \"first-third-letter codon\nposition rule\" (Siemion & Siemion, 1994)3 (see Tables 5 and 6 in this paper in\nrelation to Tables 3a and 3b in Rako\u010devi\u0107, 2004).\n\n3\n\nSiemion and Siemion, 1994, p. 139: \"It is shown that in the pairs of amino acids coded by the\ncodon possessing identical bases in the first and second positions, the amino acid with R in the\nthird position are of higher structural importance than the amino acids coded with Y\" (Remark 1:\n\n8\n\n\f3 DISCUSSION\nThe key for understanding the arrangement in this new Genetic Code Table,\nas it is given in Table 2, is the alphabet-permutation hierarchy, given in Table\n1.The first 4+4 permutations are given in relation to the type of the base (to be\nPy or Pu), next 4+4 in relation to the number of hydrogen bonds (realized\nbetween codon \u2013 anticodon), and the last 4+4 in relation to the functional group\n(to be oxo, i.e. hydroxyl, or amino functional group in terminal molecule\nposition)4. By this, one must notice that permutation arrangement is given\nthrough the logic of existence the pairs of the pairs, and also notice that it makes\nsense to determine the permutation ordinal number only within each three octets,\nin two manner: going from up to down, on the left, and in a vice versa direction,\non the right. (Remark 2: It is necessary to distinguish the principle \"to be the pair\nof the pairs\" from the principle \"to exchange a pair for a pair\"; cf. Remark 3.)\nThat follows from the mirror symmetry, which can be realized through two\nlogics: 1. Single letter to single letter, and 2. Letter doublet to letter doublet.\nThus, as the first permutation in third octet, we have: in first logic UGCA /\nACGU and in second one: UGCA / CAUG. That is the reason why the\npermutation CAUG is the first, and not \u2013 the fourth5.\nIn the other words, the key problem in this analysis of the relationships in CT\nis the question which is related to the status of permutations within Table 1.\nBearing in mind this aspect of the said question, and in order for better\nunderstanding, we mention here some additional facts. So, the second\npermutation in first octet (UCGA) is also used as a codon arrangement in WCT,\nwhen occurs a strict distinction between four-codon and non-four-codon AAs\n(Yang, 2003).\n\nExcept with Pu, a purine can be denoted with the letter R, and a pyrimidine, Py, with the letter Y\nas it is here.)\n4\n\nRako\u010devi\u0107, 1988, p. 112: \u201eA system of four \u201esmall\" molecules is made up of two purine and\ntwo pyrimidine bases. ... The four [molecules] are mutually distinguishable by three main\ncharacteristics: the type of base (purine, Pu, or Pyrimidine, Py); the type of functional group in\nthe terminal position (position 6 in purine, position 4 in pyrimidine) \u2013 either oxo or amino; and\nthe number of hydrogen bonds linking them in the system codon \u2013 anticodon.\"\n5\nThis cyclization itself is also valid for all \"8 x 3\" quadruplets in three permutation octets. The\nquadruplet UUXX is realized three times going in up/down, and three times in a vice versa\ndirection; so on the left, and so on the right, regarding the whole permutation system (two and\ntwo outer columns). The same is valid for the quadruplets XYXY.\n\n9\n\n\fOn the other hand, two permutations from third octet appear also as very\ncharacteristic, and in a specific connection through Py-pair / Pu-pair inversion,\nboth on the right and in ordering read from down to up; the first and fourth\npermutations, CA-UG and AC-GU, respectively. Namely, the CA-UG\npermutation is used in a p-adic mathematics application to the genetic code\nstructure (Dragovich & Dragovich, 2006), whereas from the AC-GU it follows\nan ordinal number of AAs within WCT from 0 to 19 (Damjanovi\u0107, 1998;\nDamjanovi\u0107 & Rako\u010devi\u0107, 2005, 2006).\nFrom this follows that two permutations, CA-UG and AC-GU appear as a\nnew pair (through an inversion), the outer pair, complementary with the inner\npair CA-GU and AC-UG. The same is valid for the first quadruplet (and for all\nother), and that is the reason why the fourth permutation (CUGA) is so power for\na new splitting into the CT, such a splitting from that follows Table 3 as \"a\nfreedom degree\" for CT, presented in Table 2. (Remark 3: The existence of one\nouter and one inner pair within eight quadruplets, in Table 1, one can understand\nas the principle \u2013 to exchange a pair for a pair; cf. Remark 2.)\nIn accordance to this discussion there are some possible chemical reasons,\nfrom which we give here only a choice. Namely, we will give only an\nexplanation for the ordinal number 1, going from the simplest to the most\ncomplex of amino acid molecules; complex from different aspects (three toned\nspaces in Table 1).\n\n*\nFirst octet, permutation UCAG: From the aspect of the type of the base,\npyrimidine is simpler than purine (one ring versus two rings). On the other hand,\nU and A with two hydrogen bonds both, are simpler than C and G, which possess\nthree hydrogen bonds each.\nSecond octet, permutation UACG: From the aspect of the number of\nhydrogen bonds, U and A are simpler than C and G. On the other hand U is\nsimpler than A as a pyrimidine molecule.\nThird octet, permutation CAUG: From two purines A is simpler than G,\nbecause it possesses an amino functional group only; in the other words, G is\nmore complex through its two functional groups \u2013 amino and oxo6. (In addition,\none must notice that nitrogen is simpler than oxygen.) In a pairing process, the\nbase U, possessing two more complex functional groups (the oxo group, two\ntimes!) must go with G, and simpler C, with only one oxo group, must be with\nA. Certainly, in both cases of pairing, the pyrimidine must be before purine as\nthe simpler molecule.\n6\n\nThe base A, as we know, is simpler than G through the number of hydrogen bonds too.\n\n10\n\n\fTable 7. The distribution of the canonical AAs in standard Genetic Code Table, in\ncorrespondence with the Py-Pu distinction, atom and nucleon number (unit change) balance\n(including the balance of the isotope number as it is shown in Remark 5)7. Notice that AAs are\ngiven in ordering as they exist within standard GCT, going from column to column. Notice that\namino acid arrangement exists as 12\u00b11 AAs between two \"stop\" codon positions. First 12 AAs\nbefore UAA (ochre) and UAG (amber); and next 12-1 before UGA (opal). Reading from C over\nF there are 12+1 AAs. Notice that quantum \"074\" is a head-nucleon-number.\n\nIn connection with the first, there is a second question which is related to the\nhierarchy of the three permutation octets. After our hypothesis, the hierarchy\nmust be \u2013 as it is given. That is so, because such a hierarchy is found in Gray\n7\n\nThe reading logic, e.g. for Proline: CCY and CCR \u2013 one and the same amino acid, P; e.g. for\nIsoleucine: AUY one amino acid \u2013 I; AUR \u2013 two different AAs: I and M; in total: I, I, M. (The\nletters Y & R as said in Remark 1.)\n\n11\n\n\fcode model of genetic code (Swanson, 1984) as well as on the genetic code\nbinary tree (Rako\u010devi\u0107, 1998)8.\n*\nRemark 4: Atom number and nucleon number within amino acid side chains:\nF 14 (91), L 13 (57), I 13 (57), M 11 (75), V 10 (43), A 04 (15), T 08 (45), P 08\n(41), S 05 (15), Y 15 (107), H 11 (81), Q 11 (72), N 08 (58), K 15 (72), D 07\n(59), E 10 (73), G 01 (01), R 17 (100), W 18 (130), C 05 (47).\nRemark 5: The isotope (nuclide) number balance in Table 7: the difference\nbetween left and right half equals \u00b10, as follows: F28 + L26 + L26 + I26 + I26 +\nM24 + V20 + A08 + T17 + P16 + S11 + Y31 = 259; 259 = H22 + Q23 + N17 +\nK30 + D16 + E22 + G02 + R34 + S11 + R34 + W36 + C12.\nRemark 6: The isotope (nuclide) number balance in Table 8, in a zigzag\n(periodic) ordering: the difference between two halves equals \u00b11, as follows:\n(F28 + L26 + S11) + (A08 + V20 + R34) + (L26 + P16 + H22) + (T17 + M24 +\nI26) = 259\u20131; 259 + 1 = (G02 + E22 + D16) +(Y31 + C12 + W36) + (S11 +\nK30 + N17) + (Q23 + R34 + I26).\nRemark 7: The number 259 is the first permutation in column 7 of\nShcherbak's modular system (in module 9) of multiples of number 037 (Table 1\nin Shcherbak, 1994, p. 476); moreover, the nucleon number within four-codon\nand non-four-codon AAs is determined only with 7th column, as multiples of\n259, and with 1st row, as multiples of 111.\nRemark 8: An example of calculation of particles number for serine side\nchain: atom number: CH2 + OH = 5 atoms; isotope number: C-12 and C-13\nequals 2 isotopes; H-1 and H-2 (three times) equals 6 isotope; O-16, O-17 and O18 equals 3 isotopes; in total: 2 + 6 + 3 = 11 isotopes; nucleon number within\nfirst isotope, i.e. nuclide: 12 + (3 x 1) + 16 = 31.\n\n8\n\nOn the Gray code model as well as on the genetic code binary tree, the first codon classification\nis given after type of the base (Py/Pu distinction) and second one after the number of hydrogen\nbonds. The logic existing within third characteristics (functional group oxo or amino in terminal\nPy/Pu base position) parallel with these two classifications is not found. From this it follows:\nneither to be the first, nor the second one, then must be \u2013 the third (the third octet of permutations\nin Table 1).\n\n12\n\n\fTable 8. The distribution of the canonical AAs in standard Genetic Code Table, in\ncorrespondence with the Py-Pu distinction, atom and nucleon number (unit change) balance,\nincluding the balance of the isotope number as it is shown in Remark 6. Notice that AAs are\ngiven in ordering as they exist within standard GCT, going from row to row. Notice 121=112.\n\nIn some manner, independently from discussed questions, there is a\nfundamental question, which is related to the \"choice\" of the number of letters\nwithin a code-alphabet and, per se, the number of permutations. It is self-evident\nthat from the aspect of the principle \"to be pair of pair\", the 3-letter, 5-letter, 6letter and 7-letter alphabets are not possible. The next, after the 4-letter alphabet,\nwhich seems to be possible, is just the 8-letter alphabet. But that is an illusion.\nWhy? In 4-letter alphabet each permutation really contains a pair of pair of\nletters: (a-b, c-d) whereas in 8-letter alphabet \u2013 more than a pair of pair. From\nthis aspect, and from the aspect of the above discussed two principles \"the pair of\n13\n\n\fthe pairs\" and \"a pair for a pair\" (Remarks 2 & 3), it makes sense to conclude\nthat the system of 24 permutations (12 pairs), given in a manner as in Table 1, is\none and only possible solution. Bearing this state in mind, it is clear why the\namino acid corresponding Py-Pu codon splitting, in standard Genetic Code\nTable, is also given in 24 amino acid meanings (Tables 7 and 8), i.e. as 12 pairs\nin both cases9.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn conclusion we express a hope that the revelation of these regularities can\nhelp in a better understanding of codon - amino acid assignment over two classes\nof aaRS (De Duve, 1988; Hipps, 1995; Schimmel, 1995). On the other hand,\nsuch strict connections between two classes of enzymes, two classes of AAs and\nbelonging codons, provide evidence to support the hypothesis, given in a\nprevious paper (Rako\u010devi\u0107, 2004), that genetic code was complete from the very\nbeginning as the condition for origin and evolution of the life.\n\nREFERENCES\nCrick, C.
