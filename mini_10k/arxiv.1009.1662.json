INTRODUCTION\n\nThe tight correlation between the far-IR and radio\nemission of starforming galaxies has been well studied in the local universe and established over many orders of magnitude in luminosity (e.g. Helou et al. 1985;\nYun et al. 2001). The radio emission of normal galaxies is dominated by synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons accelerated by supernovae and free-free\nemission from HII regions (Condon 1992). Both supernovae and HII regions are related to young, massive stars (M & 10M\u2299), and hence radio emission in\nnormal galaxies is correlated with star formation. The\nUV emission from young stars is re-radiated by dust\nin the mid-to-far-infrared so IR emission is also related\nto star forming processes. The far-IR/radio correlation is important because it is a probe of the starforming processes taking place. Deviations from the correlation may occur due to, for example, the varying\nstrength of galactic magnetic fields, evolution of dust and\n\nmetallicity properties, and increasing Inverse Compton\nlosses off the cosmic microwave background (e.g.Murphy\n2009; Lacki & Thompson 2010). The far-IR/radio correlation can also be used to select radio loud AGN (e.g.\nDonley et al. 2005). Thus, it is important to determine\nwhether the correlation holds at high redshift.\nA sensitive infrared probe of high-redshift star\nformation is the 24 \u03bcm band of the Multiband\nImaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) instrument\n(Rieke et al. 2004) on board the Spitzer Space Telescope (Werner et al. 2004). Several deep surveys have\ncorrelated 24 \u03bcm with radio data to study the midIR/radio relation (Boyle et al. 2007; Beswick et al. 2008;\nIbar et al. 2008; Garn & Alexander 2009). Some of these\nauthors (Boyle et al. 2007; Beswick et al. 2008) observe\na change in the mid-IR/radio ratio at faint radio and/or\n24 \u03bcm flux densities, but the differences in the results\nare likely to be because of selection biases which lead to\ndifferent populations being studied.\nMore recent work in the COSMOS field has found lit-\n\n\f2\ntle variation in the IR-radio ratio of starforming galaxies\nfor z < 1.4, and for the limited sample of sources confirmed at z > 2.5 the average IR-radio ratio is still the\nsame as that found locally (Sargent et al. 2010). Discrepant measurements of the average IR-radio ratio can\nbe reconciled by the fact that previous studies selected in\neither IR or radio, or required a detection in both bands\n(Sargent et al. 2010).\nIn 1998 the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observed\na region in the southern continuous viewing zone as a\ncomplementary observation to the Hubble Deep Field\nNorth (HDF-N, Williams et al. 1996). This field, known\nas the Hubble Deep Field South (HDF-S; Williams et al.\n2000), reaches a limit of \u223c30 magnitude in the four HST\nWFPC2 broadband filters. Simultaneous observations\nwith the other HST instruments, NICMOS and STIS,\nreach similarly deep levels in the near-infrared and ultraviolet. In addition to the main HST deep fields, a mosaic of nine flanking fields were imaged to shallower levels of \u223c25 magnitude in I (F814W) (Lucas et al. 2003).\nWide-field ground based imaging has been performed by\nPalunas et al. (2000) and the Multiwavelength Survey by\nYale-Chile (MUSYC) team (Gawiser et al. 2006), reaching R band magnitude limits of \u223c25 and 26, respectively.\nThis field has been the target of deep radio observations reaching \u223c10\u03bcJy rms at 1.4, 2.5, 5.2 and 8.7 GHz\n(Huynh et al. 2005, 2007).\nConfirming the COSMOS results requires a deep and\nreasonably wide MIPS field. In this paper we present the\nMIPS 24\u03bcm observations of the Hubble Deep Field South\nand take advantage of the enormous amount of multiwavelength data available to study the IR-radio correlation of galaxies detected in this field. We use a stacking\ntechnique in the radio to determine the average IR-radio\nratio of a flux-limited IR selected galaxy sample.\nIn Section 1 we describe the MIPS observations and\ndata reduction. We summarize the multiwavelength data\nused for this work, in particular the MUSYC data, in\nSection 2. The MIPS source detection and extraction is\ndiscussed in Section 4 and here we present the 24 \u03bcm catalog, source counts and redshift distributions. Section 5\nreports our work on the IR-radio correlation in the HDFS\nand our identification of infrared-faint radio sources in\nthe field. We conclude with a summary in Section 6.\nA Hubble constant of 71 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , and a standard\n\u039b-CDM cosmology with \u03a9M = 0.27 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.73 is\nassumed throughout this paper.\n2. MIPS OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\n\nThe MIPS 24 \u03bcm observations of the Hubble Deep\nField South were carried out over 2 campaigns. The first\nwas in 2004 as part of the Guaranteed Time Observations\n(PI Fazio) and the second in 2007 Cycle 3 observations\n(PID30873, PI Labbe ). The GTO observations were\ntaken using the MIPS Photometry mode and covered six\npointings in the HDF-S region. The Cycle 3 observations\nconsisted of four pointings which covered the area west\nof the WFPC2 field (Figure 1). The coverage (Figure\n1) is very uneven, with effective on sky integration time\nper pixel ranging from about 4500 seconds in the deepest\narea to 900 seconds in the shallow regions.\nThe Basic Calibrated Data (BCDs) were downloaded\nfrom the Spitzer Science Center (SSC) archive and were\nreduced using version 18.1.5 of the MOsaicker and Point\n\nsource EXtractor (MOPEX) software from the SSC. As\nrecommended, the first frame from each commanded sequence of exposures (i.e. DCENUM=0) was discarded.\nMosaicing the BCDs at this point resulted in latent artifacts. Flatfields were created using the MOPEX routine flatfield.pl, which makes a median flatfield from a\nsequence of BCDs. For the GTO data we found that\nbright sources in the field affected the flatfield generation because of insufficient dithering within the individual Astronomical Observing Requests (AORs) in the\nGTO data. Therefore we combined all AORs in the GTO\ndata to reduce the effect of bright sources being counted\nin the flatfield statistics. All four GTO AORs in 2004\nwere observed within four hours of each other, so combining all them to make a master flat is reasonable because\nthe instrument flatfield characteristics do not change over\nsuch a short timescale. The Cycle 3 observations do not\nhave the dithering issue, and flatfields were generated for\neach AOR from simply feeding the BCDs of the individual AOR into flatfield.pl.\nAfter flatfielding the BCDs the MOPEX task overlap.pl was used to level the backgrounds. The BCDs\nwere then mosaicked in the usual way with MOPEX using the default pixel scale of 2.45\" per pixel. The outlier\nrejection, which has a default of 5\u03c3, was set to the more\naggressive value of 3\u03c3. The resulting image, with units\nof MJy/sr, is shown in Figure 1. This image is about 254\narcmin2 in size.\n3. MULTIWAVELENGTH ANCILLARY DATA\n\nThe field was observed by the main three instruments\non the Hubble Space Telescope in 1998 to depths rivaling that of original Hubble Deep Field in the north\n(Williams et al. 2000). The HST imaging reaches 10\u03c3\nAB magnitudes of approximately 27.7 in I band (F814W)\n(Casertano et al. 2000) in the deepest region. Including\nthe flanking fields, Hubble imaging covers only a small\n\u223c50 arcmin2 area, however.\nMore recently, the Multiwavelength Survey by YaleChile (MUSYC) observed an approximate 37 \u00d7 37 arcmin region surrounding the Hubble Deep Field South\nin UBVRIz' optical bands (Gawiser et al. 2006). These\nobservations reach UBVRIz' magnitude limits (5\u03c3, AB)\nof 26.0, 26.1, 26.0, 25.8, 24.7 and 23.6, respectively. The\nMUSYC team also obtained NIR imaging in J, H and\nK' filters reaching 5\u03c3 depths of 22.9, 21.8 and 21.1 Vega\nmagnitudes over two 10 \u00d7 10 arcmin fields in the extended Hubble Deep Field South (Quadri et al. 2007).\nInfrared Array Camera (IRAC) data from Spitzer was\nalso obtained as part of the GTO (PI Fazio) and 2007\nCycle 3 observations (PID30873, PI Labbe ). The BCDs\nfrom the SSC archive had the usual procedures applied\nto remove cosmics rays and artifacts, such as column\npulldown, muxbleed and maxstripe (see Marchesini et al.\n2009 for details). Individual background-subtracted images were combined into mosaics covering two 10 \u00d7\n10 arcmin regions to limiting AB magnitudes (3\u03c3) of\n24.5, 24.0, 22.2, and 22.1 at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0 \u03bcm,\nrespectively(Marchesini et al. 2009).\nAccurate photometric redshifts were determined with\neazy from the MUSYC 14 band optical-IRAC data\n(Marchesini et al. 2009). eazy, a template-fitting code\nsimilar to HYPERZ (Bolzonella et al. 2000) and BPZ\n(Ben\u0131\u0301tez 2000), has been found, has been found to\n\n\f3\nprovide high quality redshifts over 0 . z . 4\n(Brammer et al. 2008), despite the fact that it is not\ntrained on a spectroscopic sample. eazy has the option\nof linearly combining templates when fitting sources and\nprovides multiple estimates of the photometric redshift,\nincluding zpeak , which is determined from the full probability distribution rather than a straight \u03c72 minimization. In the case where there are two widely-separated\npeaks in the redshift probability function, zpeak selects\nthe peak with the largest integrated probability. In the\neCDFS the MUSYC team achieved photometric redshift\naccuracies of \u03b4z/(1 + z) \u223c 0.008 with eazy, but this\nresult came from supplementing UBVRIz'JHK optical\nimaging, with Spitzer IRAC and 18 medium band optical\nimages from Subaru (Cardamone et al. submitted). The\nphotometric redshifts from the 14 band optical-IRAC\ndata have an accuracy of \u03b4z/(1 + z) = 0.000 \u00b1 0.033\nand the fraction of catastrophic outliers is only 4%\n(Marchesini et al. 2009).\nThe radio observations of the HDF-S were made between 1998 and 2001 with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) using all four available frequency\nbands. Between 100 and 300 hours of observing at each\nband yielded images at 1.4, 2.5, 5.2, and 8.7 GHz with\nmaximum sensitivities of \u223c10 \u03bcJy rms (Huynh et al.\n2005, 2007).\n4. MIPS IMAGE ANALYSIS\n4.1. Source Detection and Extraction\n\nSources detection and extraction was performed using\nthe Astronomical Point Source extraction (APEX) tools\nin the MOPEX software. First, APEX performs a local\nbackground subtraction by taking a median within a box\nsurrounding each pixel. The box size was set to 34 pixels,\nor \u223c14 times the Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM)\nof the 24\u03bcm PSF, and the median calculated after rejecting the 100 highest pixels. APEX detects sources\nwhen a pixel cluster has values which are above the noise\nthreshold, but this requires a good estimate of the noise.\nThe MOPEX and APEX software can produce several\ntypes of noise images. The \"std\" noise image produced\nat the mosaicking stage provides the empirical scatter of\neach pixel from the repeated observations divided by the\nsquare-root of the number of observations. This underestimates the true noise because it doesn't account for\npixel-to-pixel correlated noise or confusion noise. APEX\ngenerates an output \"noise\" map by calculating the noise\nwithin a local box, and here we use the same settings as\nfor the background subtraction - 34 pixel rectangular box\nand rejection of 100 outlier pixels. Using an approach\nsimilar to Frayer et al. (2009), the \"std\" and \"noise\" images are then combined in quadrature with equal weights\nto obtain a combined uncertainty image for source detection and extraction.\nWe then checked whether the combined uncertainty\nimage was reasonable by checking this against an independent total noise value. An independent estimate of\nthe total noise in the image was made by measuring the\nflux density in apertures randomly placed on the image\nand calculating the standard deviation of the measurements. Two hundred apertures were placed randomly in\n60 by 60 pixels regions of a residual image with bright\nsources removed. The standard deviation of the flux den-\n\nsity measurements agreed with the combined uncertainty\nimage to within 50%.\nSources were detected by APEX if they had a peak\nwith a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than 4 and\nwere fitted using the Point-source Response Function\n(PRF) image provided by the SSC. The sources were\nthen included in the final catalog if they had a fitted\nSNR greater than 5. This relatively high SNR was chosen to minimize the number of spurious detections. Even\nwith this SNR ratio the initial source list (504 total) was\nvisually examined for potential spurious sources such as\nthose in the Airy rings of bright sources. Only 9 (\u223c2%)\nsources were removed, suggesting that the APEX algorithm is reliable. The final 24 \u03bcm catalog contains 495\nsources.\nThe full 5\u03c3 catalog is presented in Table 1. A description of the Table is as follows.\nColumn (1) - Source ID.\nColumn (2) - Right Ascension in J2000.\nColumn (3) - Declination in J2000.\nColumn (4) - 24 \u03bcm flux density, in \u03bcJy.\nColumn (5) - 24 \u03bcm flux density uncertainty, in \u03bcJy.\nThis is the formal error from APEX.\nColumn (6) - Signal to noise ratio of the source.\n4.2. Completeness and Flux Boosting\n\nThe completeness of the source catalog was estimated\nby simulations. Monte-Carlo-like simulations were performed by injecting 10000 sources at random locations\non to the map and extracting them using the same technique as adopted for the production of the catalog. While\ncompleteness levels vary significantly across the image as\na function of coverage and flux density, we can recover\nthe overall completeness level of the generated catalog by\ninjecting sources over the full image. A single source was\ninjected per simulation, and the input flux density varied\nfrom 50 to 3000 \u03bcJy to sample the full range of interest.\nThe completeness as a function of flux density is shown\nin Figure 2. The completeness rises steeply from about\n10% at 100 \u03bcJy to approximately 90% at 250 \u03bcJy. The\n50% completeness level occurs at approximately 150 \u03bcJy.\nSource detection algorithms that rely on finding a peak\nabove a local noise background lead to flux boosting.\nThis is because sources that lie on a noise peak have\ntheir flux density increased and therefore have a higher\nprobability of being detected, while sources which lie on\na noise trough have decreased flux densities and may\nbe excluded altogether. This effect is most pronounced\nin the faintest flux density bins, i.e. in sources with a\nSNR close to the limit of the catalog. The degree of flux\nboosting can be estimated by examining the output to\ninput flux density of the simulations (Figure 2). We find\nthat flux densities are boosted by about 1% to 4% for\nmeasured flux densities of 100 to 300 \u03bcJy, on average.\nThe flux boosting is negligible for sources with true flux\ndensities brighter than 300 \u03bcJy.\nThe simulations can also be used to gauge the positional accuracy of the catalog by comparing input and\noutput positions. The median of the RA and Dec offsets\nare plotted for various input flux density bins in Figure 3.\nThe positional accuracy can be estimated from the standard deviation in the offsets of each of these bins. We\nfind that at the faintest levels (80 \u03bcJy) the RA and Dec\nuncertainties are approximately 0.8 and 1.3 arcsec, re-\n\n\f4\nspectively. The positional accuracy is much better than\n0.5 arcsec for sources that are 1 mJy and brighter. This\nis the random component only, and doesn't take into account any systematic offsets in the pointing. Spitzer has\nan absolute pointing uncertainty of about 1 arcsec.\n5. RESULTS\n5.1. Source Counts\nThe source counts were derived from the SNR \u2265 5\ncatalog. We correct the source counts for flux boosting and completeness using the results of Section 4.2.\nFigure 4 shows the Euclidean normalized source counts\n(dN/dS \u00d7 S 2.5 ) and the results are tabulated in Table\n2. The uncertainties listed are derived from Poissonian\nstatistics. The counts from this work span the peak\nnear 0.2 \u2013 0.3 mJy. We have also plotted the counts\nfrom five Guaranteed Time Observation (GTO) fields\n(Papovich et al. 2004), the FIrst Look Survey (FLS)\nfield Marleau et al. (2004) and Spitzer Wide-field InfraRed Extragalactic (SWIRE) fields Shupe et al. (2008)\nfor comparison. In the fainter bins HDFS counts are\nbroadly consistent with that from previous work, showing the steep decline for S24 < 0.2 mJy. At brighter flux\ndensities the counts are consistent with the FLS, within\nthe uncertainties, but lower than that from the GTO or\nSWIRE fields. At \u223c0.5 mJy the SWIRE counts are about\n40% higher the HDFS, and about 20% higher than the\nFLS or GTO source counts. This illustrates that there\nis significant field to field variation, which Shupe et al.\n(2008) estimated to be about 10% for sub-mJy flux densities in regions as large as the SWIRE fields (> 7 degrees).\nAlso overlaid in Figure 4 are the normalized\ncounts from the model of Lagache et al. (2004). See\nLagache et al. (2004) for details, but briefly, this model\nuses starburst and normal galaxy templates and fits for\nthe evolution of the local luminosity function that is best\nconstrained by observed source counts and redshift distributions. We note that this model used counts at 15,\n60, 170 and 850 \u03bcm from literature as well as the 24 \u03bcm\ncounts from Papovich et al. (2004). The model is broadly\nconsistent with the HDFS, FLS and GTO counts and reproduces the turnover at \u223c0.1 mJy that is seen in these\nfields.\n5.2. Optical Counterparts\nWe used the MUSYC catalogs to identify optical counterparts to the MIPS sources and obtain redshift information from either the spectroscopic or photometric\ncatalogs. The MUSYC imaging overlaps almost the entire MIPS imaging, with only the \u223c 24 arcmin2 region\nnorth of Dec = \u221260.4994 falling outside the MUSYC\nobservations. Thus, 25/495 (5%) MIPS sources do not\nhave MUSYC coverage. The MUSYC K-selected catalog (Quadri et al. 2007) and v1.0 optical catalog\n(Gawiser et al. 2006) were searched for counterparts to\nthe rest of the MIPS sample.\nWith the \u223c1 arcsec seeing of the observations and the\nastrometric uncertainties of the USNO-A2 stars used for\nastrometry, the positional uncertainties of the MUSYC\nsources are about 0.2 \u2013 0.3 arcsec. For MIPS the 1\u03c3\npositional uncertainty can be estimated by 0.5\u03b8FWHM /\n(S/N) assuming Gaussian noise, and hence a beam size\n\nof 6 arcsec implies a positional uncertainty of 0.6 arcsec\n(in each coordinate) for the faintest sources. Including\nthe Spitzer 1 arcsec absolute pointing uncertainty, the\n1\u03c3 offset between MIPS and MUSYC sources should be\nabout 1.3 arcsec for the faintest MIPS sources.\nFigure 5 shows a plot of distribution of the offsets\nbetween all MIPS and MUSYC K-selected (Quadri et\nal. 2007) sources within 2 arcsec. As expected, there\nis a peak in the distribution of offsets at .0.5 arcsec.\nThe contribution from chance matches due to the optical source density is also shown in Figure 5. We find that\nthe number of chance matches meets the number of observed matches at a radius of \u223c 1.5 arcsec and therefore\nuse this as our matching radius. 369 MIPS sources have\na counterpart in the K-selected catalogs and a photometric redshift from Marchesini et al. (2009). A further 37\nhave counterparts in the optical MUSYC catalogs, which\ncover a larger area than the K band imaging. For these 37\nsources eazy photometric redshifts were calculated from\nthe MUSYC UBVRIz optical data plus a narrow band\n5000 A image. A comparison of these seven-band photometric redshifts with 166 spectroscopic redshifts from\nliterature finds only 18% have \u03b4z/(1 + z) > 0.2. Excluding these outliers, we find \u03b4z/(1 + z) = 0.027 \u00b1 0.046, and\nthus conclude the photometric redshifts are statistically\nreliable. In total 406/495 (82%) of the MIPS sources\nhave a MUSYC optical or NIR counterpart. Three have\nmore than one MUSYC source within 1.5 and in these\ncases the optical candidates were individually examined\nand the most likely candidate chosen using the P statistic\n(e.g. Downes et al. 1986; Lilly et al. 1999).\nSpectroscopic redshifts from the literature are available\nfor 22 of the MIPS sources, and we assume the photometric redshift, where available, for the remaining sources.\nThe redshift distribution of the MIPS sources peak at\nz \u223c 0.5 with a tail to high redshift (z > 2, Figure 5). The\ntotal infrared luminosity (8 \u2013 1000 \u03bcm) of the sources\nis estimated by fitting the 24 \u03bcm flux density to the\nluminosity dependent SED templates of Chary & Elbaz\n(2001). We integrate the best fit template over 8 \u2013 1000\n\u03bcm to derive the total IR luminosity (LIR) (Figure 6).\nWe find luminous IR galaxies (LIRGS, 1011 L\u2299 < LIR\n< 1012 L\u2299 ) are detected out to z \u223c 1.1, while ultraluminous IR galaxies (ULIRGs, LIR > 1012 L\u2299 ) are detected out to higher redshifts. We note that while the\nChary & Elbaz (2001) templates exhibit observed FIR\nflux density ratios which are more representative of z \u223c 1\ngalaxies than Dale and Helou (2002) or Lagache et al.\n(2003) templates (Magnelli et al. 2009), the choice of\ntemplates can lead to \u223c 0.3 dex variation in luminosity.\nFitting to the 24 \u03bcm flux density alone can give a good\nLIR estimate up to about z \u223c 1.4, but for 1.4 < z < 2.5\nthe LIR can be overestimated by up to a factor of four\n(Murphy et al. 2009).\n6. DISCUSSION\n6.1. Infrared-Radio Correlation\nRadio counterparts to the MIR sources were obtained using the 1.4 GHz radio catalog of the HDFS\n(Huynh et al. 2005). We applied a simple radial match\nof 3 arcsec, and find 84 MIPS sources have a radio counterpart. The matching distance is large enough for obtaining bona-fide matches since the 24 \u03bcm positional un-\n\n\f5\ncertainties are \u223c 1.2 arcsec and the radio positions are\nbetter than about 1 arcsec in most cases (Huynh et al.\n2005). The P-statistic suggests the probability of one or\nmore radio sources within 3 arcsec of a IR one by chance\nis \u223c 0.3%, but this estimate does not take into account\nthe individual positional uncertainties and assumes the\nradio source population is not clustered.\nThe IR/radio correlation as a function of redshift is\npresented in Figure 7, shown as the observable parameter q24 = log(S24\u03bcm )/S1.4GHz ). For the 84 sources with\ndetections in both the IR and radio the median q24 =\n0.71 \u00b1 0.31. This is consistent with the q24 = 0.84 \u00b1\n0.28 found in the xFLS Appleton et al. (2004) and q24\n= 0.66 \u00b1 0.39 in the SubaruXMMNewton Deep Field\n(SXDF, Ibar et al. 2008). Overlaid on Figure 7 are SED\ntracks from local templates by Chary & Elbaz (2001).\nWe find that up to redshift one the IR sources appear\nto follow tracks of local SEDs, suggesting the IR-radio\ncorrelation holds to this redshift. Above redshift one the\n24 \u03bcm band starts to observe the MIR regime (. 12\u03bcm\nrestframe) where PAH emission and silicate absorption\nstrengths vary widely in individual galaxies, and hence\na wide range of MIR/radio ratios is possible. The high\nredshift (z > 1) sources in Figure 7 also fall within the\nratios allowed by local templates, but most are best described by the SEDs of relatively low luminosity SEDs\n(L < 1012 Lsun). These sources have luminosities that\nare ULIRG-like (> 1012 Lsun, Figure 6) but exhibit ratios similar to local \u223c 1011 Lsun LIRGs, implying that\nthe SEDs of high redshift ULIRGs differ to that of local ones. We speculate that these ULIRGs have strong\nPAH emission, as seen in other IR samples of high redshift ULIRGs (e.g. Yan et al. 2007), but IR spectra are\nneeded to confirm that hypothesis.\nTo extend the results we stack the IR sample in the\nradio data. First, the IR sources were binned into 6\nredshifts bins, as shown in Table 3. For each redshift\nbin, the radio data was stacked at positions of all undetected sources and a noise-weighted mean image was\nproduced. Stacks of width 60\u2032\u2032 wide were produced and\nthe photometry performed by fitting a point source to\nthe stacked radio image. All stacks, shown as postage\nstamps in Figure 8, have a significant detection. The resulting q24 values from the stacked radio flux densities\nare shown as blue squares in Figure 7. They have been\ncombined with the actual detections to derive an average q24 for all MIPS sources in the various redshift bins\n(green squares). We find that the average observed q24\nat high redshift (z > 1) is approximately 0.86 (Table 3)\nand this is consistent with local LIR \u223c 1011 LIRG SED\n(Figure 7). At these redshifts our sample have ULIRG\nluminosities or greater, so this is further evidence that\nthe average IR luminous galaxy at high redshift is better\ndescribed by a lower luminosity local template. This result is consistent with complementary studies which have\nfound that some high redshift IR luminous galaxies have\ncooler SEDs than local galaxies of similar luminosities\n(Seymour et al. 2010; Muzzin et al. 2010).\nAs mentioned before, the high redshift ULIRGs may\nexhibit stronger PAH emission than local galaxies, leading to a greater q24 then expected from local SEDs. However, the increased q24 at high redshift may also result\nfrom suppressed radio emission. If a galaxy has just be-\n\ngun a burst of star formation then the MIR dust emission\nmay be enhanced due to star formation but the supernova rate, which powers the radio emission, lags the star\nformation by about \u223c 30 Myr (the approximate lifetime\nof 8 M\u2299 stars). It is possible that some of the sources\nat high redshift are nascent starbursts. Increased inverse\nCompton scattering of the cosmic microwave background\nat high redshift can lead to lower radio emission than in\nthe local universe, and since the energy density of the\nCMB scales as (1 + z)4 this could be significant at high\nredshifts. Another potential explanation is that the high\nredshift galaxies have lower magnetic field strengths than\nlocal galaxies, leading to decreased electron confinement\nand therefore lower radio emission.\n6.2. Infrared-Faint Radio Sources\n\nInfrared-Faint Radio Sources (IFRSs) are a class of radio sources recently discovered in the Australia Telescope\nLarge Area Survey (ATLAS) by Norris et al. (2006).\nThese are radio sources brighter than a few hundred \u03bcJy\nat 1.4 GHz which have no observable infrared counterpart\nin the Spitzer Wide-area Infrared Extragalactic Survey\n(SWIRE; Lonsdale et al. 2004). Most have flux densities\nof a few hundred \u03bcJy at 1.4 GHz, but some are as bright\nas 20 mJy, resulting in extreme infrared to radio ratios. Recent VLBI detections have constrained the radio\nsources sizes to less than 0.03 arcsec, suggesting IFRSs\nare compact AGN (Norris et al. 2007; Middelberg et al.\n2008). Deeper Spitzer legacy survey data in the extended\nChandra Deep Field South yielded two IRAC detections\nof the four IFRSs in that field, and SED modeling of\nthese sources with the new constraints showed that they\nare consistent with z > 1 radio-loud AGN (Huynh et al.\n2010).\nThe MIPS data of the Hubble Deep Field South allows us to search for IFRSs in this field. There are\nnine ATHDFS sources with S1.4GHz > 200 \u03bcJy that\ndo not have a MIPS counterpart. These are listed in\nin Table 4 along with their MIPS (5\u03c3) limit and IRAC\nproperties. All of these sources have low q24 values consistent with radio-loud AGN, and most have moderate\nphotometric redshifts of 0.417 < z < 1.548. Most are\nalso relatively bright in the IRAC channels, and would\nhave been detected by SWIRE depth IRAC imaging. Of\nthe nine sources, one (ATHDFS J223205.9\u2212603857) is\nnot in the 5\u03c3 IRAC catalog of Marchesini et al. (2009)\nand one is not in the IRAC field. Hence only one\nsource matches the Norris et al. 2006 criteria for\nIFRS. One IFRS in the 252 arcmin2 MIPS HDFS region is consistent with the IFRS source density of \u223c\n16/deg2 in the eCDFS. ATHDFS J223205.9\u2212603857 has\na S3.6\u03bcm (5\u03c3) limit of 2 \u03bcJy and hence a radio-toIRAC flux density ratio (S1.4GHz /S3.6\u03bcm ) greater than\nabout 130. Similarly high radio-to-IRAC flux density\nratios are found for both IFRS and high redshift radio galaxies (HzRGs) (Seymour et al. 2007; Huynh et al.\n2010), suggesting they are high-redshift AGN. For\nATHDFS J223205.9\u2212603857, the low value of q24 (<\n\u22120.50) and high value of S1.4GHz /S3.6\u03bcm therefore suggests it is a high redshift (z > 1) radio-loud AGN.\nThe radio spectral index between 1.4 and 2.5 GHz for\nthese nine ATHDFS sources is also listed in Table 4. All\nbut two have radio SEDs with a spectral index \u03b1 \u223c \u22120.8\n(S \u221d \u03bd \u03b1 ), which is consistent with synchrotron emission.\n\n\f6\nThe IFRS candidate ATHDFS J223205.9\u2212603857 has a\nspectral index \u03b1 = \u22120.80 \u00b1 0.29. This result is consistent\nwith Middelberg et al. 2010 (submitted) who find IFRSs\nhave \u03b1 < \u22120.7.\n7. SUMMARY\n\nWe have presented the MIPS 24 \u03bcm observations of\nthe Hubble Deep Field South from the Spitzer Space\nTelescope. This new MIR image, 250 arcmin2 in area,\nreaches a maximum sensitivity of \u223c12 \u03bcJy rms, with the\nbulk of the image achieving \u223c 20 \u03bcJy rms. A catalog of\nsources brighter than 5\u03c3 was compiled, comprising 495\nsources. The completeness corrected and flux-deboosted\n24 \u03bcm source count was presented, and while the counts\nare consistent with results in the literature they show\nthat there is significant field to field variation.\nThe MIPS sources were matched to MUSYC photometric redshift and ATHDFS 1.4 GHz radio catalogs. The IR-radio ratio q24 , log(S24\u03bcm )/S1.4GHz ), for\n84 sources with both IR and radio detections have a median q24 = 0.71 \u00b1 0.31, consistent with previous results.\nWe find that while there is diversity in galaxy SEDs,\nthe IR-radio correlation appears to hold out to z \u223c 1.\nThe results were extended by splitting the sample into\nredshift bins and stacking all IR sources not detected\nin the radio to derive a an average radio flux density\nand hence an average q24 . The observed average q24 was\ncompared with that expected from local SED templates\nand at z > 1 the observed average q24 is found to be\nbetter described by LIRG templates, even though these\nsources have ULIRG-like luminosities. This is further\nevidence that the average IR luminous galaxy at high\nredshift is better described by a lower luminosity local\n\ntemplate. The change in q24 may be due to enhanced\nMIR emission, possibly from hot dust heated by AGN\nor relatively bright PAH emission, or suppressed radio\nemission due to lower strength magnetic fields, inverse\nCompton scattering off the CMB. Several of the high\nredshift galaxies may be nascent starburst where the radio emission from supernovae is delayed compared to the\nIR and hence a high q24 results. More detailed IR observations and spectroscopy to determine the AGN/SB\nnature of the IR galaxies is required to differentiate between these possible scenarios.\nThe Herschel Space Observatory, launched in May\n2009, is currently undertaking deep IR surveys in bands\nranging from 70 to 450 \u03bcm. These bands are close to the\npeak of the IR emission from dust and not significantly\naffected by AGN or PAH emission. With its unprecedented depth and resolution, Herschel will observe large\ncomplete samples of IR galaxies to redshifts of z = 2 and\nbeyond. In combination with upcoming radio facilities\nsuch as eVLA, ASKAP, and MeerKAT, this will allow a\nmajor improvement in the study of the IR-radio correlation in the high redshift universe.\nMTH wishes to thank D.

Completeness is the\nnumber of extracted sources divided by number of input sources.

Red circles are results from the xFLS (Frayer et al. 2006).\nThe blue squares are average q24 for the MIR sources undetected in the radio, where the average radio flux density is derived from a\nstacking analysis. The green squares are the average q24 for all MIR sources, i.e. combining the blue squares with radio detections.
