However it is not a complete theory, since there are indications of phenomena\nwhich the SM does not describe. Supersymmetry (SUSY) [1] is one of the extensions of the SM that provides a solution to many shortcomings of the SM. SUSY\nis the symmetry between different states of spin, i.e. between fermions and bosons.\nSince each SM particle has its SUSY partner, sparticle, the number of parameters in\nSUSY is increased. The minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) is a model\nwith minimal particle content. It is possible in the MSSM that the third generation\nsquarks are lighter than the first and second, thus making them accessible to Tevatron\nexperiments.\nIt is known that particles and sparticles do not have the same mass, which is\nan indication that SUSY is broken. There are several possible mechanisms of SUSY\nbreaking. D0 and CDF have searched for gauginos within the minimal supergravity\nmodel (mSUGRA), and gauge mediated symmetry breaking model (GMSB). The\nmSUGRA is described by five independent parameters: the unified scalar and gaugino\nmasses m0 and m1/2 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs\ndoublets tan \u03b2, the unified trilinear coupling A0 , and the sign of the Higgs mass\nparameter sign(\u03bc). GMSB is described by six parameters: the breaking scale \u039b, the\nmass and number of messengers M and N, the scale factor of gravitino mass Cgrav ,\ntan \u03b2 and the sign(\u03bc).\nR-parity, defined as R = (\u22121)3(B\u2212L)+2S , where B is baryon number, L is lepton\nnumber, and S is spin, is introduced to preserve lepton and baryon number conservation. If it is conserved the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is stable, all\nsparticles eventually decay to LSP, and sparticles are produced in pairs. However,\nlepton and baryon number symmetry is accidental, so R-parity is imposed by hand. If\nR-parity is violated SUSY particles decay to SM particles and they can be produced\nsingly, which leads to higher cross sections at Tevatron.\nThe CDF [2] and D0 [3, 4, 5] detectors are multi purpose detectors. They consist\nof central tracking system, electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters and outer muon\ndetectors. They recorded about 10 fb\u22121 of data between April 2002 and May 2011.\nResults presented in this article use up to 6.3 fb\u22121 .\n\n2\n\nThird generation squark searches\n\nThe D0 experiment searched for pair production of sbottom quarks [6] in 5.2 fb\u22121\nof data. It was assumed that the mass of the sbottom quark satisfied mb + m\u03c7 \u03030 <\n1\nm  \u0303 < mt + m  \u0303\u2212 , so only b \u03031 \u2192 b\u03c7 \u030301 was possible, and that \u03c7 \u030301 was the LSP. The search\nb1\n\n\u03c71\n\nwas interpreted in the MSSM with R-parity conservation. The signature of this final\n1\n\n\fstate was two b jets and large missing transverse energy E\n/ T , so data were recorded\nusing a combination of jet and E\n/ T based triggers. The dominant SM background was\nfrom multijet (MJ) events where instrumental E\n/ T was present due to jet resolution\nand mismeasurement. It was estimated from data. Other backgrounds included\nW/Z+jets, tt and diboson events, which were obtained from Monte Carlo (MC)\nsimulation. Events were required to have at least two not back-to-back b-tagged jets\nwith pT > 20 GeV and E\n/ T > 40 GeV. Selection was further optimized for different\nchoices of (mb \u03031 , m\u03c7 \u03030 ) to achieve the maximal sensitivity. Good agreement between\n1\ndata and SM backgrounds was observed as can be seen in Fig. 1 (left) and Table 1.\nA 95% C.L limit on the production of sbottom quark pairs was set and the excluded\nregion is shown in the plane of the bottom squark versus neutralino mass in Fig. 1\n(right).\nmb \u03031 , m\u03c7 \u03030\n1\nData\nBackground\nSignal\n\n(130,85)\n(240,0)\n901\n7\n971 \u00b1 52 6.9 \u00b1 1.7\n481 \u00b1 66 10.5 \u00b1 1.9\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\nET (GeV)\n\nV\nGe\n1\n\n310 pb-1\n\n08\n\n\u03c7\u223c 0\n\n0\n0\n\nD0\nRun II\n\nCDF\nRun I\n88 pb-1\n\nCDF\nRun II -1\n295 pb\n\nD0\nRun I -1\n92 pb\n\n20\n0\n\nD0 Run II\n5.2 fb-1\n\ns=\n2\n\n60\n40\n\n1\n\n+m\n\n10\n\nb\n\nDiboson\nMultijet\n\n80\n\nP\n\nTop\n\nLE\n\nW+jets\n\n(b)\n\nObserved\nExpected\n\n100\n\n=m\n\nLQ3 240 GeV\nZ+jets\n\n102\n\nD0, L=5.2 fb-1\n\n1\n\n1 1\n\n120\n\nb\n\n(a)\n\nData\n\n0\n~\nb \u223c\u03c7 (130,85) GeV\n\nm~\n\n103 D0, L=5.2 fb-1\n\nNeutralino Mass (GeV)\n\nEvents / 10 GeV\n\nTable 1: Number of events for the two chosen (mb \u03031 , m\u03c7 \u03030 ) points for data, SM expec1\ntation and sbottom quark signal.\n\n50\n\n100\n150\n200\n250\nBottom Squark Mass (GeV)\n\nFigure 1: The E\n/ T distribution in the b \u03031 b \u03031 \u2192 b\u03c7 \u030301 b\u03c7 \u030301 search for data, expected SM\nbackgrounds, and sbottom quark signal for mb \u03031 = 130 GeV and m\u03c7 \u03030 = 85 GeV (left).\n1\nThe observed and expected 95 % C.L. exclusion contour in a mb \u03031 and m\u03c7 \u03030 plane\n1\n(right).\nD0 [7] and CDF [8] searched for pair production of scalar top quarks.

The dominant SM backgrounds included Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 where both \u03c4\nleptons decayed leptonically, top quark pairs, diboson production, W +jets and instrumental MJ background. To further optimize this search, samples were divided\naccording to the mass difference between t \u03031 and \u03bd\u0303, \u2206M = Mt \u03031 \u2212 M\u03bd\u0303 . D0 chose two\nbenchmark points, (Mt \u03031 , M\u03bd\u0303 ) = (200, 100) GeV for \"large-\u2206M\", \u2206M > 60 GeV,\nand (Mt \u03031 , M\u03bd\u0303 ) = (110, 90) GeV for \"small-\u2206M\", \u2206M < 60 GeV. Signal selection\nwas optimized as a function of \u2206M. In a dominant background after preselection,\nZ \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 , two leptons were often back to back, and E\n/ T was low. Thus, an additional\nrequirement was introduced, events were rejected if \u2206\u03c6(e, \u03bc) > 2.8 and E\n/ T < 20 GeV.\nFig. 2 (left) shows muon pT after this selection. To discriminate against dominant\nbackgrounds (Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 , tt and diboson) and signal, a separate multivariate analysis\noutput (MVA) was built for each background. A cut was then applied on the most\ndiscriminating MVA, which was tt for \"small-\u2206M\", and Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 for \"large-\u2206M\".\nA two dimensional histogram of the remaining two MVA distributions was used to\nsearch for signal. In the absence of any significant excess, the 95% C.L. exclusion\nlimits on scalar top quark production as a function of the \u03bd\u0303 and t \u03031 masses was set,\nand is shown in Fig. 2 (right).\n\n80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 240\nScalar Top Quark Mass (GeV)\n\nFigure 2: The pT of the muon for data, expected background and two different Mt \u03031\nrepresenting small\u2212\u2206M and large\u2212\u2206M (left).

The final state, containing two leptons, two b quarks and E\n/ T from neutralino\nis identical to top quark pair production. Thus the reconstructed top mass will be\nbiased toward lower values in the presence of scalar top quarks. Events were selected\nwith two leptons with pT > 20 GeV, two jets with pT > 12 GeV, and E\n/ T > 20 GeV.\nThe dominant SM backgrounds were tt, Z + jets, diboson and instrumental MJ\nbackground. To maximize sensitivity of this search, samples were divided into events\nwith no-b-tagged jets and at least one b-tagged jet. Data was in agreement with SM\nprediction as shown in Table 2.

To remove events with poorly modeled\nE\n/ T , events were rejected with \u2206\u03c6 between E\n/ T and leading jet (if present) greater than\n2.5, and \u2206\u03c6 between E\n/ T and any photon less than 0.2. SM backgrounds, which were\ncategorized as instrumental E\n/ T sources (\u03b3\u03b3, \u03b3+jet and MJ), and genuine E\n/ T sources\n(W \u03b3, W +jets, W/Z + \u03b3\u03b3), were estimated from data. Figure 7 (left) shows the E\n/T\ndistribution in \u03b3\u03b3 events, where a good agreement between data and SM backgrounds\nwas observed. A GMSB scenario was probed using the set of parameters from the\nSPS8 model, where the scale \u039b was unconstrained, Mmes = 2\u039b, Nmes = 1, tan \u03b2 = 15,\nand \u03bc > 0. Since no evidence of the SUSY in the E\n/ T distribution was observed, a\n95% C.L. upper limit on the cross section production as a function of \u039b, m\u03c7 \u03030 and\n1\nm\u03c7 \u0303\u00b1 was set (Fig. 7 (right)).\n1\n\nD0 searched for signatures of hidden-valley models [14] in 5.8 fb\u22121 of data. Hidden\nvalley models contain a hidden sector that is very weakly coupled to the SM. The\nforce carrier in the hidden-valley model is the dark photon (\u03b3D ), which is assumed\nto be very light (m\u03b3D < 2 GeV) and decays into a pair of SM charged fermions. In\nthese models, SUSY will have partners for both the SM and the hidden sector. It\nwas assumed that the LSP of the hidden sector X\u0303 was lighter than the lightest SM\nSUSY partner SM-LSP. Then the SM-LSP decayed promptly into particles of the\nhidden sector if R-parity was conserved.

Since \u03b3D can decay to a pair of electrons or to a\npair of muons, l-jet can be either \"electron l-jet\" (elj ) or \"muon l-jet\" (\u03bclj ). Events\nwere selected with two l-jets, elj elj , elj \u03bclj or \u03bclj \u03bclj . The main backgrounds, which\nwere estimated from a data, consist of MJ production, and, in a case of elj , photon\nproduction with a decay to e+ e\u2212 pairs. We searched for presence of leptonic jets in\nthe events with E\n/ T > 30 GeV. Figure 8 (left) shows invariant mass of two muon l jets\nfor different assumption of m\u03b3D . With no significant excess observed in data, 95%\nC.L. upper limits were set as a function of m\u03b3D on the production cross section for\nSUSY particles decaying to two l-jets and large E\n/ T (Fig. 8 (right)).\n\n4\n\nR-parity violation searches\n\nIf R-parity is violated single production of SUSY particles is allowed, and they can\nbe observed at Tevatron. D0 searched for resonant production of a sneutrino which\ndecays into an electron and a muon in 5.4 fb\u22121 of data [15].

Events were selected with one isolated\nelectron with pT > 30 GeV, one isolated muon with pT > 25 GeV and no jets with\npT > 25 GeV. Signal events have low E\n/ T , but due to limited momentum resolution\nof the muons, some E\n/ T will be present if it is either aligned or anti-aligned with\nmuon.

It was required that the\nsum of the pT of the six leading jets was greater than 250 GeV. The final requirement\nP\njjj pT \u2212Mjjj > offset, with distributions shown in Fig. 10 (left) for RPV gluino with\nmass of 190 GeV and Fig. 10 (right) for data, was optimized for different mass points.\nMJ background was estimated from five jets data and fitted with Landau function.\nTo extract signal from combinatorial background Landau+Gaussian fit was used (see\nFig. 11 (left)), and number of signal events was obtained by integrating the Gaussian\nin \u00b11\u03c3 range. No significant excess was observed in data, and a 95% C.L. limit on\nthe cross section times branching ratio as a function of gluino mass was set, and it is\nshown in Fig. 11 (right).\n\n104\n\n800\n700\n\n103\n\n600\n500\n\n102\n\n400\n300\n\nPYTHIA RPV Gluino\nm=133 GeV/c2\n\n200\n\n0\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800 900 1000\n|p | [GeV/c]\n\n\u2211\njjj\n\n103\n\n900\n800\n700\n\n102\n\n600\n500\n400\n\nDATA\n\n300\n10\n\n\u2265 20 entries per event\n\n10\n\n200\n\n\u2265 20 entries per event\n\n100\n\nCDF RUN II Preliminary 3.2 fb-1\n\n1000\n\n100\n1\n\n0\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\nt\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900 1000\n\n1\n\n\u2211 |p | [GeV/c]\njjj\n\nt\n\nP\n\n[pb]\n\n105\n\n\u03c3 \u00d7 BR(pp \u2192 3j + 3j)\n\nFigure 10: Distributions of the Mjjj vs jjj pT for the RPV gluino signal (left) and\ndata (right).

It is shown that\ndata agrees with SM expectations, and thus SUSY parameter space has been constrained. Limits set by various CDF and D0 searches are the most stringent to date.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nD0 and CDF thank the staffs at Fermilab and collaborating institutions.
