Introduction\nLet A be a noetherian commutative ring of Krull dimension d and let P be\na projective A-module of rank r. Finding \"computable\" necessary and sufficient\nconditions for P to be free is in general a very hard question. The first obvious\ne 0 (A) and, if r > d its vanishing is also a sufficient\nobstruction is the class of P in K\ncondition by Bass-Schanuel cancellation theorem. Thus one is reduced to the case\nof stably free modules of rank r \u2264 d. In the critical case r = d, the situation\nis rather well understood. Observe first that a stably free module of rank r = d\ncan be seen as the kernel of a surjection Ad+1 \u2192 A and that such surjections are\ngiven by rows (a1 , . . . , ad+1 ) such that the ai 's generate A. Such a row is called\n1\n\n\f2\n\nJ. FASEL\n\nunimodular, and it is easily seen that there is an action of GLd+1 (A) on the set\nU md+1 (A) of unimodular rows of rank d + 1. A stably free module is free if and\nonly if its associated unimodular row is in the GLd+1 (A) orbit of (1, 0, . . . , 0). This\nobstruction is \"computable\" in the following sense: If Ed+1 (A) is the subgroup of\nGLd+1 (A) generated by the elementary matrices, then there is a structure of abelian\ngroup on U md+1 (A)/Ed+1 (A) ([21, Theorem 4.1]). If moreover A is a smooth kalgebra of dimension d \u2265 3 over a perfect field of characteristic different from 2,\nthis group can be seen as the cohomology group H d (A, Gd+1 ), where Gd+1 is a\nsuitable sheaf on Spec(A) ([11, Theorem 4.9]). The induced action of SLd+1 (A)\non U md+1 (A)/Ed+1 reads in this particular situation as a group homomorphism\nSLd+1 (A)/Ed+1 (A) \u2192 U md+1 (A)/Ed+1 (A) defined by sending a matrix to its first\nrow. The cokernel of this map is in bijection with U md+1 (A)/SLd+1 (A), which is\ntherefore computable in some situations (see [11, Theorem 5.6] for some cases).\nIf the projective module P is of rank r < d, then the situation is much harder.\nFor example, the question whether there exists a complex smooth algebra A of\ndimension 3 and a stably free non free projective A-module of rank 2 has been\nsolved only recently ([12, Theorem 5.4]). In this paper, we prove the following\ntheorem (Theorem 4.3 in the text):\nTheorem. Let A be a ring of dimension 3. Then every projective module of rank\ne 0 Sp(A) and the set\n2 with trivial determinant is free if and only if the group K\nU m4 (A)/Sp4 (A) are both zero.\n\ne 0 Sp(A) appearing in the theorem is just the Grothendieck-Witt\nThe group K\n2\ngroup GW (A) modulo the subgroup generated by the antisymmetric form H(A)\nand U m4 (A)/Sp4 (A) is just the set of orbits of U m4 (A) under the action of Sp4 (A).\nThe first group is \"computable\" in the sense that it is part of a cohomology theory.\nAs an application of the above result, we get the following theorem (Theorem\n6.11 in the text):\nTheorem. Every finitely generated projective module over the real algebraic sphere\nof dimension 3 is free.\nIt should be pointed out that the stable structure of the algebraic vector bundles\non spheres is well-known ([13]; [19]), but that the set of isomorphism classes of\nsuch vector bundles is much more difficult to compute. At the moment, this is\nknown only for the circle S 1 (obvious) and the two-dimensional sphere S 2 ([3]).\nThe result on S 3 could be thought of as a measure of the recent progresses made\nin understanding the unstable structure of projective modules.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we recall a few basic facts about\ne 0 Sp(A), and the\nsymplectic modules. This includes the definitions of the group K\ndefinition of the Euler class of a projective module of rank 2. The following section is\ndevoted to the study of the set of unimodular rows of even length n under the action\nof the symplectic group Spn (A). We show that a unimodular row of even length n\ngives a stably free module of rank n \u2212 2 endowed with an antisymmetric form. This\ne 0 Sp(A) is therefore trivial)\nform is stably isometric to H(An/2 ) (whose class in K\n(n\u22122)/2\nand becomes isometric to H(A\n) if and only if its associated unimodular row\nis in the Spn (A)-orbit of (1, 0, . . . , 0). We prove the theorem on the freeness of\nprojective modules of rank 2 in Section 4. The basic (and classical) observation\nhere is that every projective module of rank 2 is endowed with a non-degenerated\nantisymmetric form. In Section 5, we recall the definition and the basic properties\n\n\fPROJECTIVE MODULES OVER THE REAL ALGEBRAIC SPHERE OF DIMENSION 3\n\n3\n\ne 0 Sp(A) and\nof the Gersten-Witt complex. The last section shows that the group K\nthe set U m4 (A)/Sp4 (A) involved in the first theorem vanish when A = S 3 is the\ne 0 Sp(S 3 ) coincide\ncoordinate ring of the real algebraic sphere of dimension d. Since K\n2\n3\nwith the derived Witt group W (S ) as defined by Balmer ([1]), we compute the\nlatter. It must be pointed out that C. Walter announced the computation of the\nderived Witt groups of quadrics, and therefore we only compute the groups needed\nin our main result without going to much into the details. Our computation is\nrather technical, and probably one can find a better approach. We conclude with\nthe proof of our theorem that all the finitely generated projective modules on S 3\nare free.\n1.1. Conventions. All the rings considered are commutative and noetherian. The\ndimension of a ring will always be its Krull dimension. If X is a scheme and x \u2208 X,\nwe denote by \u03ba(x) the residue field of x. If X is integral, we simply denote by \u03ba(X)\nthe residue field at the generic point.\n2. Symplectic modules\ne 0 Sp(A, L). Let A be a commutative ring and let L be a line\n2.1. The group K\nbundle over A. Let GW 2 (A, L) be the Grothendieck-Witt group of the (exact) category of projective A-modules endowed with the duality HomA (_, L) and the usual\ncanonical isomorphism \u03c9 : Id \u2192 HomA (HomA (_, L), L). Explicitly, GW 2 (A, L)\nis the Grothendieck group of the monoid (with the orthogonal sum \u22a5 as operation) of isometry classes of pairs (P, \u03c6), where P is a projective A-module and\n\u03c6 : P \u2192 HomA (P, L) is an anti-symmetric isomorphism.\nIf Q is a projective A-module, we define H(Q) to be the pair (Q\u2295HomA (Q, L), h),\nwhere\nh : Q \u2295 HomA (P, L) \u2192 HomA (Q, L) \u2295 HomA (HomA (P, L), L)\nis defined by h(q, f )(q \u2032 , f \u2032 ) = f (q \u2032 ) \u2212 f \u2032 (q). This induces a homomorphism\nH : K0 (A) \u2192 GW 2 (A, L)\nwhose cokernel is the Witt group W 2 (A, L).\ne 0 Sp(A, L) the quotient of GW 2 (A, L) by the subgroup generated\nWe denote by K\ne 0 Sp(A) the group K\ne 0 Sp(A, A).\nby H(A). If L = A, we simply denote by K\n\n2.2. Euler classes. Let P be a projective module of rank 2. Then P is endowed\nwith an anti-symmetric form \u03c7 : P \u2192 HomA (P, det P ) defined by \u03c7(p)(q) = p \u2227 q.\ne 0 Sp(A, det P ). Suppose that f : P \u2192 Q is\nWe denote by e(P ) the class of (P, \u03c7) in K\nan isomorphism of (rank 2) projective modules. Then det f induces an isomorphism\ne 0 Sp(A, det P ) \u2192 K\ne 0 Sp(A, det Q) under which e(P ) is sent to e(Q). The Euler\nK\nclass satisfies good functorial properties, as shown in [9, \u00a72.4, \u00a72.5]. In particular,\nProposition 2.1. Suppose that P \u2243 (det P ) \u2295 A. Then e(P ) = 0.\n\nIf A is of dimension 2, then the proposition is the easy part of a stronger result\n([9, Proposition 23]):\nTheorem 2.2. Let A be a ring of dimension 2. Then e(P ) = 0 if and only if\nP \u2243 (det P ) \u2295 A.\nIf A is of dimension 3, then the above result is no longer true, and even for a\nstably free module of rank 2 we need another obstruction to detect whether it is\nfree or not. This is the object of the next section.\n\n\f4\n\nJ. FASEL\n\n3. Unimodular rows under the symplectic group\n3.1. Unimodular rows. A unimodular row of length n is a surjective homomorphism An \u2192 A. Equivalently, a unimodular row is represented by a set (a1 , . . . , an )\nof elements of A which generate the ideal A. The group GLn (A) acts on U mn (A)\nby composition, and therefore any subgroup of GLn (A) also acts. Traditionally, one\nis interested either in En (A) (the subgroup generated by the elementary matrices)\nor in GLn (A) itself. Indeed, the set of orbits U mn (A)/GLn (A) detects the stably\nfree non free modules of rank n \u2212 1 as follows:\nLet v = (a1 , . . . , an ) be a unimodular row and let P (v) be the projective module\ndefined by the exact sequence\n0\n\n// An\n\n// P (v)\n\nv\n\n// A\n\n// 0.\n\nIt is easily seen that the following proposition holds:\nProposition 3.1. The modules P (v) and P (v \u2032 ) are isomorphic if and only if there\nis a matrix G \u2208 GLn (A) such that vG = v \u2032 .\nThis proposition also shows that the set U mn (A)/GLn (A) is quite hard to compute in general. If one restricts to En (A), the situation is slightly better, as shown\nby the next result due to W. van der Kallen ([21, Theorem 4.1]):\nTheorem 3.2. Let A be a ring of dimension d. If n \u2265 (d+4)/2 then U mn (A)/En (A)\nhas the structure of an abelian group.\nOf course, this doesn't imply that U mn (A)/En (A) becomes suddenly easy to\ncompute. However, in the special situation when A is a smooth algebra of dimension d over a field of characteristic different from 2, it is shown in [11] that\nU md+1 (A)/Ed+1 (A) (same d) has a cohomological interpretation ([loc. cit., Theorem 4.9]). This led to the computation of those groups for any smooth rational\noriented real algebra ([loc. cit.,Theorem 5.6]).\nSuppose now that n is even. Then An is the underlying module of the antisymmetric form h : An \u2243 (An )\u2228 which is \u22a5n/2 H(A). Any unimodular row v of length\nn gives a stably free module of rank n \u2212 2 endowed with an antisymmetric form as\nfollows:\nThe exact sequence\n0\n\ni\n\n// P (v)\n\n// An\n\nv\n\n// A\n\n// 0\n\nyields a commutative diagram\n0\n\n0\n\n// A\u2228\n\u001f\n\u001f\ns\n\u001f\u000f\u000f\n\n// P (v)\n\nv\u2228\n\n// (An )\u2228\n\ni\u2228\n\nh\u22121\ni\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// An\n\nv\n\n// P (v)\u2228\n\u001f\n\u001f\n\u2212s\u2228\n\u001f\n\u000f\u000f\n// A\n\n// 0\n\n// 0\n\nSince h is antisymmetric vh\u22121 v \u2228 = 0 and therefore we get a homomorphism s\nmaking the diagram commutative. Observe that ker(s\u2228 ) is projective and equal\nto coker(s)\u2228 . The snake lemma gives an isomorphism coker(s) \u2192 ker(s)\u2228 which is\nantisymmetric.\nDefinition 3.3. If v is a unimodular row of even length n, we denote by (Q(v), \u03c6(v))\nthe antisymmetric pair obtained above.\n\n\fPROJECTIVE MODULES OVER THE REAL ALGEBRAIC SPHERE OF DIMENSION 3\n\n5\n\nLemma 3.4. There is an isometry (Q(v), \u03c6(v))\u22a5H(A) \u2243 H(An/2 ).\nProof. Consider the following diagram\n\u03b3\n\n0\n\n// A\n\nv\n\nv\n\n\u2228\n\n// (An )\u2228\n\ns\n\n0\n\n\u000f\u000f w\nQ(v)\n\nv\n\nv\n\u2228\n\ni\n\ni\n\nw\n\nw\u03b3\n\nw\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// An\n;w;\n\nv\n\nQ(v)\u2228\nv::\nj\u2228\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// P (v)\u2228\n\n// 0\n\n\u2212s\u2228\n\nh\u22121\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// P (v)\nj\n\n\u2228\n\nv\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// A\n\n// 0\n\nChoosing an element w \u2208 An such that v * w = 1 we get a section \u03b1 of v and\ntherefore a section r = i\u2228 h\u03b1 of \u2212s\u2228 and a retraction \u2212r\u2228 of s. This gives a section\n\u03b2 of j and we get an injective homomorphism \u03b3 : Q(v) \u2192 An . One checks easily\nthat \u03c6(v) = \u03b3 \u2228 h\u03b3 and that we have An = Ah\u22121 v \u2228 \u2295 Aw \u2295 \u03b3Q(v). Moreover, w and\nh\u22121 v \u2228 are both in \u03b3Q(v)\u22a5 and they generate a submodule isometric to H(A). \u0003\nThe following result is the analogue of Proposition 3.1 for \"decorated\" modules:\nProposition 3.5. The pairs (Q(v), \u03c6(v)) and (Q(v \u2032 ), \u03c6(v \u2032 )) are isometric if and\nonly if there is a matrix M \u2208 Spn (A) such that vM = v \u2032 .\nProof. Following the construction of Q(v \u2032 ) for v \u2032 = vM , we see that in that case\n(Q(v \u2032 ), \u03c6(v \u2032 )) is isometric to (Q(v), \u03c6(v)). Lemma 3.4 gives the converse statement.\n\u0003\nThis shows that U mn (A)/Spn (A) classifies the stably free modules of rank n \u2212 2\ndecorated with the antisymmetric form obtained above.\n4. Cancellation of symplectic modules\nLet A be a ring of odd dimension d \u2265 3. Let (Q, \u03c6) be an antisymmetric pair,\nwhere Q is of rank d \u2212 1. Suppose that there is an isometry\nf : H(A)\u22a5(Q, \u03c6) \u2243 H(A(d+1)/2 )\nThe projection of A2 to the first factor gives a homomorphism e\u22171 : A2 \u2295 Q \u2192 A.\nThen e\u22171 f \u22121 is a unimodular row of length d + 1. If g is another such isometry,\nthen gf \u22121 \u2208 Spd+1 (A) and e\u22171 g \u22121 (gf \u22121 ) = e\u22171 f \u22121 . Therefore, the class of e\u22171 f \u22121 in\nU md+1 (A)/Spd+1 (A) is independent of the isometry f .\nDefinition 4.1. If (Q, \u03c6) is a symmetric pair such that Q is of rank d \u2212 1 and\nH(A)\u22a5(Q, \u03c6) \u2243 H(A(d+1)/2 ), we denote by sp(Q, \u03c6) the class of e\u22171 f \u22121 in the set\nU md+1 (A)/Spd+1 (A) for any isometry f . We call it the symplectic class of (Q, \u03c6).\nThis definition seems rather artificial at first sight. However, the next proposition\nshows that it is natural.\nProposition 4.2. Let v := sp(Q, \u03c6). Then (Q, \u03c6) is isometric to (Q(v), \u03c6(v)).\n\n\f6\n\nJ. FASEL\n\nProof. Let f : H(A)\u22a5(Q, \u03c6) \u2243 H(A(d+1)/2 ) be the isometry defining sp(Q, \u03c6).\nConsider the commutative diagram\n0\n\n0\n\n// Q \u2295 A\n\u001f\n\u2032 \u001f\nf\n\u001f\n\u000f\u000f\n// P (v)\n\n// Q \u2295 A2\n\ne\u2217\n1\n\n// A\n\n// 0\n\n// A\n\n// 0\n\nf\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// An\n\nv\n\nThe construction of (Q(v), \u03c6(v)) shows that f \u2032 : Q \u2295 A \u2192 P (v) induces an isometry\n(Q, \u03c6) \u2243 (Q(v), \u03c6(v)).\n\u0003\nSo we have a procedure to understand when an antisymmetric pair (Q, \u03c6) is\ne 0 Sp(A). If this is\nisometric to H(A(d\u22121)/2 ). The first obstruction is its class in K\n(d\u22121)/2\ndifferent from 0, then it cannot be isometric to H(A\n). If the class is zero,\nthen (using [4, Chapter IV, Corollary 4.15]) we get an isometry\n(Q, \u03c6)\u22a5H(A) \u2243 (A(d+1)/2 ).\nand therefore a symplectic class in U md+1 (A)/Spd+1 (A). Using Propositions 4.2\nand 3.5, we see that this class must be trivial in order for (Q, \u03c6) to be isometric to\nH(A(d\u22121)/2 ).\nIn dimension 3, this procedure gives a complete understanding of projective\nmodules of rank 2.\nTheorem 4.3. Let A be a ring of dimension 3. Then every projective module of\ne 0 Sp(A) and the set\nrank 2 with trivial determinant is free if and only if the group K\nU m4 (A)/Sp4 (A) are both trivial.\ne 0 Sp(A) is of the form e(P ) for some\nProof. Remark first that every element in K\nprojective module P of rank 2 (use [4, Chapter IV, Theorem 4.12]). If every such\ne 0 Sp(A) = 0 because the only non degenerate anti-symmetric\nmodule is free, then K\n2\nform on A is h (up to isometry). The set U m4 (A)/Sp4 (A) is reduced to a point\nbecause of Proposition 3.5.\ne 0 Sp(A) = 0. Then the Euler class of P is zero for any P\nSuppose now that K\nof rank 2, and its symplectic class (which is then defined) is in the Sp4 (A)-orbit of\n(1, 0, 0, 0). Therefore any such P is free by Proposition 3.5 again.\n\u0003\nIn the last section, we show that the real algebraic sphere of dimension 3 satisfy\nthe hypothesis of the theorem. We first need some preparation in order to compute\ne 0 Sp(S 3 ). This is the object of the next section.\nthe group K\n5. The Gersten-Witt complex\n\n5.1. The complex.

If Y \u2192 X is smooth, one can compare the\ncohomology groups with support on Y with the cohomology groups of Y ([10,\nRemark 9.3.5]). We will need only the following particular result ([14, Theorem\n4.1] and [10, Remark 9.3.5]) :\nLemma 5.3. Let X = Spec(A) be a regular affine scheme over a field k.

For any n \u2208 N, let S n = R[x0 , . . . , xn ]/( x2i \u22121).\nUsing the long exact sequence of localization, we see that it suffices to compute the\nWitt groups of S n\u22121 and Sxnn to compute the Witt groups of S n .

We have\n\nH i (C 1 , W ) =\n\n\u001a\n\nZ/4 if i = 0,\n0\nif i \u2265 1.\n\nProof. Since C 1 is a curve, H i (C 1 , W ) = 0 for i \u2265 2. We also get H 0 (C 1 , W ) =\nW 0 (C 1 ) = Z/4, generated by the class of h1i by [16, Theorem 2.9]. To compute\nH 1 , we first observe that H 1 (C 1 , I) = H 1 (C 1 , W ) by Lemma 5.2.\nUsing [8, Theorem 2'], we get that I 2 (\u03ba(C 1 )) = 0. Moreover, since C 1 has no real\npoint then I(\u03ba(x1 )) = 0 for any closed point x1 . Therefore, H 1 (C 1 , I) \u2243 H 1 (C 1 , I).\nThe latter is just P ic(C)/2, which is trivial by [20].\n\u0003\nLemma 6.2. We have\ni\n\n2\n\nH (C , W ) =\n\n\u001a\n\nZ/2 if i = 1,\n0\nif i \u2265 2.\n\nProof. Since C 2 is a surface, we have H i (C 2 , W ) = 0 if i \u2265 3. Because C 2 has no\nreal point, we have H 2 (C 2 , I 2 ) = 0 by [11, Proposition 5.1] (observe that C 2 has a\ntrivial canonical bundle). This shows that H 2 (C 2 , W ) = H 2 (C 2 , I) = 0.\nLemma 5.2 shows that H 1 (C 2 , I) = H 1 (C 2 , W ). We then use the sequence\ncomparing I and I 2 :\n...\n\n// H 1 (C 2 , I 2 )\n\n// H 1 (C 2 , I)\n\n// H 1 (C 2 , I)\n\n// H 2 (C 2 , I 2 )\n\n// H 1 (C 2 , I 2 )\n\n// H 1 (C 2 , I)\n\n// H 1 (C 2 , I)\n\n// H 2 (C 2 , I)\n\n// 0.\n\nwhich reduces to\n...\n\n// 0\n\nby the above discussion.\nSince none of the residue fields of Spec(C 2 ) admits an ordering, we obtain\n2\n2\nH i (C 2 , I 2 ) = H i (C 2 , I ) (argue as in [18]). Now H 1 (C 2 , I ) = 0 by [6, Corollary\n3.3, Remark 3.3.1]. This implies that the map H 1 (C 2 , I) \u2192 H 1 (C 2 , I) is an isomorphism. Since P ic(C 2 )/2 = Z/2 by [20, Theorem 9.2(b)], we get H 1 (C 2 , W ) =\nZ/2.\n\u0003\nRemark 6.3. The generator of H 1 (C 2 , W ) can be explicitly obtained. Using [20,\nRemark, p 471], we find that the generator of P ic(C 2 ) is the class of the prime\nideal p1 = (x20 + 1, x0 x1 + x2 ). Since (x20 + 1)(x21 + 1) = (x0 x1 + x2 )(x0 x1 \u2212 x2 )\n\n\f10\n\nJ. FASEL\n\nand (x0 x1 \u2212 x2 ) 6\u2208 p1 we see that p1 Cp21 is generated by x20 + 1. We thus get an\nisomorphism (necessarily symmetric) of \u03ba(p1 )-vector spaces\n\u03c1x20 +1 : \u03ba(p1 ) \u2192 Ext1Cp2 (\u03ba(p1 ), Cp21 )\n1\n\ndefined by 1 7\u2192 Kos(x20 + 1), where the latter is the Koszul complex associated to\nthe regular parameter x20 + 1.\nConsider next p2 = (x2 ). As above, we get a symmetric isomorphism of \u03ba(p2 )vector spaces\n\u03c1x2 : \u03ba(p2 ) \u2192 Ext1Cp2 (\u03ba(p2 ), Cp22 )\n2\n\ndefined by 1 7\u2192 Kos(x2 ), where the latter is the Koszul complex associated to the\nregular parameter x2 .\nThe isomorphism H 1 (C 2 , I) \u2243 H 1 (C 2 , I) (and the fact that p2 is principal)\nshows that the class of the cycle (\u03ba(p1 ), \u03c1x20 +1 ) + (\u03ba(p2 ), x1 \u03c1x2 ) is the generator\nof H 1 (C 2 , I) (observe also that we could have considered (\u03ba(p1 ), \u03c1x20 +1 ) alone as a\ngenerator, but we will need (\u03ba(p2 ), \u03c1x2 ) later and this is why we consider it).\nn\nn\u22122\nObserve next that B 1 \u2243 R[x0 , x\u22121\n[xn\u22121 ] for n \u2265 2, while\n0 ] and B /xn = C\n\u22121\n1\n\u2243 R[x0 , . . . , xn\u22122 , xn , xn ] = B [x0 , . . . , xn\u22122 ].\n\nBxnn\n\nLemma 6.4.

Since B 1 = R[x0 , x\u22121\n0 ], the result for B follows from [14, Corollary 5.2].\n1\nn\nSince Bxn \u2243 B [x0 , . . . , xn\u22122 ], the exact sequence of localization (and the homotopy\ninvariance of the Witt cohomology, see [10, Theorem 11.2.9]) yields\n\n0\n\n// H 0 (B n , W )\n\n// H 0 (B 1 , W )\n\n// Hx1 (B n , W )\nn\n\n// . . .\n\nUsing Lemma 5.3 and the computation of H i (B 1 , W ), we get an exact sequence\n0\n\n// H 0 (B n , W )\n\n// Z \u2295 Z\n\n// H 0 (C n\u22122 , W )\n\n// H 1 (B n , W )\n\n// 0\n\nand isomorphisms H i\u22121 (C n\u22122 , W ) \u2243 H i (B n , W ) for i \u2265 2. Since C 0 \u2243 C, we have\nH i\u22121 (C 0 , W ) = 0 for i \u2265 2 and Lemma 6.1 shows that the same statement is true\nfor C 1 . Hence H i (B n , W ) = 0 for i \u2265 2 and it suffices to prove that the map\nZ \u2295 Z \u2192 H 0 (C n\u22122 , W ) in the above exact sequence is surjective to conclude. The\ntwo generators of H 0 (B 1 , W ) \u2243 Z \u2295 Z are the class of h1i and hxn i. Now it is not\nhard to see that hxn i is sent to the generator of H 0 (C n\u22122 , W ) (which is either Z/2\nor Z/4) under the map Z \u2295 Z \u2192 H 0 (C n\u22122 , W ). Whence the result.\n\u0003\nNext we compute part of the Witt cohomology of Bx32 +x3 . It is of course also\npossible to compute H 0 (Bx32 +x3 , W ), but the answer is not \"nice\" and we won't\nneed it.\nLemma 6.5. We have\nH\n\ni\n\n(Bx32 +x3 , W )\n\n=\n\n\u001a\n\nZ/2 if i = 1,\n0\nif i \u2265 2.\n\n\fPROJECTIVE MODULES OVER THE REAL ALGEBRAIC SPHERE OF DIMENSION 3\n\n11\n\nProof. Since we already know the Witt cohomology groups of B 3 (Lemma 6.4)\nand B 3 /(x2 + x3 ) = C 2 (Lemma 6.2), we only have to use the exact sequence of\nlocalization. The connecting homomorphism yields isomorphisms H i (Bx32 +x3 , W ) \u2243\nH i (C 2 ) for i = 1, 2, 3. This shows the assertion.\n\u0003\nRemark 6.6. We can give an explicit generator of H 1 (Bx32 +x3 , W ). Consider the\nprime ideals q1 = (x20 + 1) and q2 = (x2 ). Taking the Koszul complexes associated\nto these regular sequences as generators of respectively Ext1Bq3 (\u03ba(q1 ), Bq31 ) and\nExt1Bq3 (\u03ba(q2 ), Bq32 ), we get symmetric isomorphisms\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\u03c1x20 +1 : \u03ba(q1 ) \u2192 Ext1Bq3 (\u03ba(q1 ), Bq31 )\n1\n\nand\n\u03c1x2 : \u03ba(q2 ) \u2192 Ext1Bq3 (\u03ba(q2 ), Bq32 )\n2\n\nas in Remark 6.3. Consider the element (\u03ba(q1 ), (x0 x1 + x2 )\u03c1x20 +1 )+ (\u03ba(q2 ), x1 x3 \u03c1x2 )\nL\nin\nx1 \u2208Spec(B 3 )(1) W (\u03ba(x1 )). A straightforward computation shows that the element (\u03ba(q2 ), x1 x3 \u03c1x2 ) is ramified exactly in the prime ideals (x1 , x2 ) and (x2 , x3 )\n(which is the same as (x2 , x2 + x3 )). On the other hand, (\u03ba(q1 ), (x0 x1 + x2 )\u03c1x20 +1 )\nis ramified in both (x1 , x2 ) and in the prime ideal p1 of Remark 6.3. Indeed, the\nequality in B 3\n(x0 x1 + x2 )(x0 x1 \u2212 x2 ) \u2212 (x20 + 1)(x21 + 1) + x2 (x2 + x3 ) = 0\nshows that a prime ideal containing (x0 x1 + x2 ) and x20 + 1 must contain either x2 ,\neither x2 + x3 . Such an ideal must therefore contain (x1 , x2 ) in the first case, and\n(x2 + x3 , x20 + 1, x0 x1 + x2 ) = p1 (seen as an ideal in B 3 ) in the second case.\nTo check that (\u03ba(q1 ), (x0 x1 + x2 )\u03c1x20 +1 ) + (\u03ba(q2 ), x1 x3 \u03c1x2 ) indeed defines a class\nin H 1 (Bx32 +x3 , W ), we must compute its image under the differential in the GerstenWitt complex associated to Bx32 +x3 . The image of (\u03ba(q1 ), (x0 x1 + x2 )\u03c1x20 +1 ) is the\nlocalization in the minimal prime ideals of its support of the complete intersection\nmodule M1 := Bx32 +x3 /(x20 +1, x0 x1 +x2 ) endowed with the symmetric isomorphism\n\u03c1x20 +1,x0 x1 +x2 : M1 \u2192 Ext2B 3\n\nx2 +x3\n\n(M1 , Bx32 +x3 )\n\ndefined by \u03c1x20 +1,x0 x1 +x2 (1) = Kos(x20 + 1, x0 x1 + x2 ), where the latter is the Koszul\ncomplex given by the regular sequence (x20 + 1, x0 x1 + x2 ). It follows from the\ndiscussion above that the only minimal prime ideal in the support of M1 is (x1 , x2 ).\nTo compute the localization of M1 and \u03c1x20 +1,x0 x1 +x2 in the prime ideal (x1 , x2 ) we\ncompare the regular sequences (x20 + 1, x0 x1 + x2 ) and (x1 , x2 ). Since x20 + 1 =\nx2 x3 \u2212 x21 in B 3 , we get\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0012 \u0013 \u0012 2\n\u0012\nx0 + 1\nx1\n\u2212x1 x3\n.\n=\nx0 x1 + x2\nx2\nx0\n1\nThe determinant of the matrix is \u2212x1 \u2212 x0 x3 , which is not in the ideal (x1 , x2 ) and\ntherefore the regular sequences (x20 + 1, x0 x1 + x2 ) and (x1 , x2 ) generate the same\n3\nideal in B(x\nand Kos(x20 + 1, x0 x1 + x2 ) = (\u2212x1 \u2212 x0 x3 )Kos(x1 , x2 ). Since\n1 ,x2 )\nthe residue field at the prime ideal (x1 , x2 ) is C(x3 ) and the class of \u2212x1 \u2212 x0 x3\nin this field is \u2212ix3 , we see that the image of (\u03ba(q1 ), (x0 x1 + x2 )\u03c1x20 +1 ) under the\ndifferential in the Gersten-Witt complex is the symmetric isomorphism\nC(x3 ) \u2192 Ext2B 3\n\n(x1 ,x2 )\n\n3\n)\n(C(x3 ), B(x\n1 ,x2 )\n\n\f12\n\nJ. FASEL\n\ndefined by 1 7\u2192 \u2212ix3 Kos(x1 , x2 ).

It is easy to check that the image of (\u03ba(q2 ), x1 x3 \u03c1x2 )\nis the symmetric isomorphism\nC(x3 ) \u2192 Ext2B 3\n\n(x1 ,x2 )\n\n3\n)\n(C(x3 ), B(x\n1 ,x2 )\n\ndefined by 1 7\u2192 x3 Kos(x2 , x1 ). Since Kos(x1 , x2 ) = \u2212Kos(x2 , x1 ), we see that\n(\u03ba(q1 ), (x0 x1 + x2 )\u03c1x20 +1 ) + (\u03ba(q2 ), x1 x3 \u03c1x2 ) indeed defines an element of the group\nH 1 (Bx32 +x3 , W ).\nWe next show that its image under the isomorphism\nH 1 (Bx32 +x3 , W ) \u2192 H 1 (C 2 , W )\nis precisely the generator obtained in Remark 6.3. We start with the computation\nof the image of (\u03ba(q1 ), (x0 x1 + x2 )\u03c1x20 +1 ). Arguing as above and using the equality\n(x0 x1 + x2 )(x0 x1 \u2212 x2 ) = (x20 + 1)(x21 + 1) \u2212 x2 (x2 + x3 )\nwe see that Kos(x20 + 1, x0 x1 + x2 ) = \u2212x2 /(x0 x1 \u2212 x2 )Kos(x20 + 1, x2 + x3 ) in\nExt2Bp3 (\u03ba(p1 ), Bp31 ). Since (x0 x1 \u2212 x2 ) = \u22122x2 in \u03ba(p1 ) (because x0 x1 + x2 is in p1 )\n1\nand \u22121/2 is a square, we see that the image of (\u03ba(q1 ), (x0 x1 + x2 )\u03c1x20 +1 ) is precisely\nthe element (\u03ba(p1 ), \u03c1x20 +1 ) defined in Remark 6.3. It remains to compute the image\nof (\u03ba(q2 ), x1 x3 \u03c1x2 ), but this is straightforward.\nP\n6.2. Witt cohomology of S 2 . Let S 2 = R[x0 , x1 , x2 ]/( x2i \u22121). As in [7], we use\nthe stereographic projection to compute the Witt cohomology of S 2 (and therefore\nits Witt groups). Explicitly, consider the algebra R[x0 , x1 ] and the polynomial\nf = x20 + x21 + 1. Then there is an isomorphism\n2\n\u2192 R[x0 , x1 ]f\nS1\u2212x\n2\n\ndefined by xi 7\u2192 2xi /f for i = 0, 1 and x2 7\u2192 (f \u2212 2)/f . Using the exact sequence\nof localization (see [1, Theorem 1.5.5]), we get an exact sequence\n0\n\n// H 0 (S 2 , W )\n\n2\n// H 0 (S1\u2212x\n,W)\n2\n\n1\n// H1\u2212x\n(S 2 , W )\n2\n\n// H 1 (S 2 , W )\n\n// . . .\n\n2\n, which is the same as the Witt\nFirst we compute the Witt cohomology of S1\u2212x\n2\ncohomology of R[x0 , x1 ]f . Using the localization sequence again, we have an exact\nsequence:\n\n0\n\n// H 0 (A2 , W )\n\n// H 0 (R[x0 , x1 ]f , W )\n\n// H 1 (A2 , W )\nf\n\n// H 1 (A2 , W )\n\n// . . .\n\nBy homotopy invariance, H 0 (A2 , W ) = Z and H i (A2 , W ) = 0 if i \u2265 1. Because f\nis a regular parameter and R[x0 , x1 ]/f = C 1 , we have Hfi (A2 , W ) \u2243 H i\u22121 (C 1 , W )\nby Lemma 5.3.\nThe sequence and Lemma 6.1 imply that H i (R[x0 , x1 ]f , W ) = 0 if i \u2265 1. To\ncompute H 0 (R[x0 , x1 ]f ), observe that the map H 0 (R, W ) \u2192 H 0 (R[x0 , x1 ]f , W )\nadmits a retraction given by the choice of any rational point. Therefore we get\nH 0 (R[x0 , x1 ]f , W ) \u2243 Z \u2295 Z/4, the factor Z/4 being generated by the class of the\nform hf i.\n\n\fPROJECTIVE MODULES OVER THE REAL ALGEBRAIC SPHERE OF DIMENSION 3\n\n13\n\ni\n(S 2 , W ). Remark that 1 \u2212 x2 is a\nIt remains to compute the groups H1\u2212x\n2\n2\n2\nregular parameter in Sx1 and that Sx1 /(1 \u2212 x2 ) \u2243 C[x1 , x\u22121\n1 ].

Since 1 \u2212 x2 is a regular\nideal (1 \u2212 x2 , x1 , x0 ) and then H1\u2212x\n2 ,x1\n2\nparameter in Sx1 , we get\n1\n(Sx21 , W ) \u2243 H 0 (Sx21 /(1 \u2212 x2 ), W ) \u2243 H 0 (C[x1 , x\u22121\nH1\u2212x\n1 ], W ) \u2243 Z/2 \u2295 Z/2,\n2\n\nthe second factor being generated by the class of the form hx1 i ([14, Theorem 5.6]).\n2\n2\n(S 2 , W ) \u2243 Z.\n(Sx21 , W ) = 0 and therefore H1\u2212x\nWe also get H1\u2212x\n2\n2\nFinally, we can compute the Witt cohomology of S 2 :\nTheorem 6.7.

But it is not hard to see that the form h1 \u2212 x2 i\n, W ) \u2192 H1\u2212x\nH 0 (S1\u2212x\n2\n2\n2\n, W ) is sent to the form h1i generating the\ngenerating the factor Z/4 in H 0 (S1\u2212x\n2\n2\n1\n\u0003\nfirst Z/2 factor in H1\u2212x2 (S , W ).\nRemark 6.8. Let q be the prime ideal of S 2 generated by (1 \u2212 x2 ). The Koszul complex Kos(1\u2212x2 ) associated to (1\u2212x2 ) can be taken as a generator of Ext1Sq2 (\u03ba(q), Sq2 )\nand we get a symmetric isomorphism\n\u03c11\u2212x2 : \u03ba(q) \u2192 Ext1Sq2 (\u03ba(q), Sq2 )\ndefined by \u03c11\u2212x2 (1) = Kos(1\u2212x2 ). Our computations above proves that a generator\nof H 1 (S 2 , W ) is given by the class of the cycle (\u03ba(q), x1 \u03c11\u2212x2 ).\n6.3. The computation of W 2 (S 3 ). We finally compute W 2 (S 3 ) \u2243 H 2 (S 3 , W ).\nTo achieve this, we use our computations of the previous sections.\nTheorem 6.9. Let S 3 be the algebraic real 3-sphere. Then W 2 (S 3 ) = 0.\nProof. We use the localization sequence\n...\n\n// H 1 (S 3 , W )\n\n// H 1 (Sx3 , W )\n3\n\n// Hx2 (S 3 , W )\n3\n\n// H 2 (S 3 , W )\n\n// H 2 (Sx3 , W ).\n3\n\nSince Sx33 \u2243 Bx32 +x3 , we get H 2 (Sx33 , W ) = 0 by Lemma 6.5. Using Lemma 5.3, we\nget an isomorphism Hx23 (S 3 , W ) \u2243 H 1 (S 2 , W ). The above exact sequence reduces\nthen to an exact sequence\n...\n\n// H 1 (S 3 , W )\n\n// H 1 (S 3 , W )\nx3\n\n// H 1 (S 2 , W )\n\n// H 2 (S 3 , W )\n\n// 0.\n\n\f14\n\nJ. FASEL\n\nIt suffices therefore to prove that the homomorphism H 1 (Sx33 , W ) \u2192 H 1 (S 2 , W ) is\nsurjective to conclude. Using the isomorphism \u03c6 : Bx32 +x3 \u2192 Sx33 and the explicit\ngenerator of Remark 6.6, we get an explicit generator of H 1 (Sx33 , W ) as follows:\nWe get \u03c6(q1 ) = (x20 + x23 ) =: q\u20321 and\n\u03c6(Kos(x20 + 1)) = Kos(x20 /x23 + 1) = (1/x23 )Kos(x20 + x23 ).\nMoreover, \u03c6(x0 x1 + x2 ) = (1/x23 )(x0 x1 + (1 \u2212 x2 )x3 ). Letting \u03c1x20 +x23 be the usual\nsymmetric isomorphism, we see that the image of (\u03ba(q1 ), (x0 x1 + x2 )\u03c1x20 +1 ) under \u03c6\nis (\u03ba(q\u20321 ), (x0 x1 + (1 \u2212 x2 )x3 )\u03c1x20 +x23 ) (since we work in a Witt group, we can forget\nthe factors (1/x23 )).\nSimilarly, we get \u03c6(q2 ) = (1 \u2212 x2 ) =: q\u20322 , \u03c6(Kos(x2 )) = (1/x3 )Kos(1 \u2212 x2 )\nand \u03c6(x1 x3 ) = (1/x23 )x1 (1 + x2 ). Hence the image of (\u03ba(q2 ), x1 x3 \u03c1x2 ) under \u03c6 is\n(\u03ba(q\u20322 ), x1 x3 \u03c11\u2212x2 ) since 1 + x2 \u2261 2 modulo q\u20322 and 2 is a square.\nWe are therefore reduced to compute the image of\n(\u03ba(q\u20321 ), (x0 x1 + (1 \u2212 x2 )x3 )\u03c1x20 +x23 ) + (\u03ba(q\u20322 ), x1 x3 \u03c11\u2212x2 )\nunder the homomorphism H 1 (Sx33 , W ) \u2192 H 1 (S 2 , W ). A direct computation shows\nthat the image of (\u03ba(q\u20321 ), (x0 x1 + (1 \u2212 x2 )x3 )\u03c1x20 +x23 ) is trivial, while the image of\n(\u03ba(q\u20322 ), x1 x3 \u03c11\u2212x2 ) is the cycle (\u03ba(q), x1 \u03c11\u2212x2 ) of Remark 6.8. Hence the homomor\u0003\nphism H 1 (Sx33 , W ) \u2192 H 1 (S 2 , W ) is surjective and the result is proved.\ne 0 Sp(S 3 ) = 0.\nCorollary 6.10. Let S 3 be the algebraic real 3-sphere. Then K\n\nProof. It is well-known that K0 (S 3 ) = Z (using the fact that in this case the\nalgebraic K-theory and the topological K-theory coincide by [19, Theorem 3]), and\ne 0 Sp(S 3 ) = W 2 (S 3 ) by definition.\ntherefore we get K\n\u0003\n6.4. Projective modules on S 3 . Now we have all the tools in hand to prove the\nfollowing theorem:\nTheorem 6.11. Every finitely generated projective module over the real algebraic\n3-sphere is free.\nProof. Because K0 (S 3 ) = 0, all the projective modules are stably free. We know\nalready that those of rank 3 are free by [11, Proposition 5.11]. In view of Theorem\ne 0 Sp(S 3 ), it remains to show that U m4 (S 3 )/Sp4 (S 3 ) is\n4.3 and our computation of K\ntrivial. By [11, Theorem 4.9, Theorem 5.6], the group U m4 (S 3 )/E4 (S 3 ) is generated\nby the class of the unimodular row (x0 , x1 , x2 , x3 ). Now the matrix\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nx0\nx1\nx2\nx3\n\uf8ec\u2212x1 x0 \u2212x3 x2 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\nM := \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\u2212x2 x3\nx0 \u2212x1 \uf8f8\n\u2212x3 \u2212x2 x1\nx0\n\nis in Sp4 (S 3 ) \u2282 SL4 (S 3 ). Mapping a matrix (of determinant 1) to its first row\nyields a homomorphism of abelian groups\nr : SL4 (S 3 )/E4 (S 3 ) \u2192 U m4 (S 3 )/E4 (S 3 )\nby [21, Theorem 5.3(ii)]. It follows that for any [v] in U m4 (S 3 )/E4 (S 3 ) there exists\nn \u2208 Z such that [v] = r(M n ). This yields [v] + r(M \u2212n ) = 0 and then vM \u2212n = e1 E\nfor some E \u2208 E4 (S 3 ). Now e1 E4 (S 3 ) = e1 ESp4 (S 3 ) by Vaserstein's theorem\n\n\fPROJECTIVE MODULES OVER THE REAL ALGEBRAIC SPHERE OF DIMENSION 3\n\n15\n\n(whose french translation can be found in [5, Proposition 6']).
