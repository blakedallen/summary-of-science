But \"... there\nis major problem: all the fermions and gauge bosons are massless, while experiment shows\notherwise.\nWhy not just add in mass terms explicitly? That will not work, since the associated terms\nbreak SU(2) or gauge invariantnes. For fermions, the mass term should be\n\nHowever, the left-handed fermion are put into SU(2) doublets and the right-handed ones into\nSU(2) singlets, so\nand\nare not SU(2) singlets and would not give an SU(2) invariant\nLagrangian.\nSimilarly, the expected mass terms for the gauge bosons,\n\nplus similar terms for other, are clearly not invariant under gauge transformations\nThe only direct way to preserve the gauge invariance and SU(2)\ninvariance of Lagrangian is to set m = 0 for all quarks, leptons and gauge bosons.... There is a\nway to solve this problem, called the Higgs mechanism.\" [2]\nNo. The Dirac Lagrangian for a free fermion can have of the following form:\n\nHere matrices\n,\n,\nand\nanticommute among themselves.\nIndeed, this Lagrangian is not invariant under the SU(2) transformation. But it is beautiful and\ntruncating its mass term is not good idea.\n]\nBut it turns out that there is a fifth matrix\nanticommuting with these four matrices. And\nthe term with this matrix should be added to this Lagrangian mass term:\n\n\fwhere\nLet U(\u03b1) be any SU(2)-matrix with parameter \u03b1, let U be the space in which U(\u03b1) acts. In such\ncase U(\u03b1) divides the space U into two orthogonal subspaces Uo and Ux such that for every\nelement \u03c8 of U there exists an elements \u03c8o of Uo and an element \u03c8x of Ux which fulfill the\nfollowing conditions:\n\nIn either case, m does not change.\nWhat is concerning the gauge bosons W\u03bc and Z\u03bc: although field F\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(\n\n)\n\nis massless, it turns out that its components obey the equation which is similar to the KleinGordon equation with nonzero mass2.\nTherefore, Higgs is neither required to obtain masses fermions, nor to obtain masses of\nbosons. Moreover, the Tevatron3 has left little hope for the experimental finding the Higgs.\nIn this article I consider the events, each of which can bound to a certain point in space-time.\nSuch events are called pointlike events [3]. Combinations (sums, products, supplements) of such\nevents are events, called physical events.\nThe probability density of pointlike events in space-time is invariant under Lorentz\ntransformations. But probability density of such events in space at a certain instant of time is not\ninvariant under these transformations. I consider the pointlike events for which density of\nprobability in space at some instant of time is the null component of a 3+1-vector function which\nis transformed by the Lorentz formulas, I call these probabilities the traceable probabilities.\nThe set \u010c of complex n \uf0b4 n matrices is called a Clifford set of range n, if here the following\nconditions are fulfilled:\nIf\nif\n\n\u220a \u010c and s \u220a \u010c then k s + s k = 2\uf064k,s;\nk s + s k = 2\uf064k,s for all \u010c's elements s then\n\nk\n\nk\n\n\u220a \u010c.\n\nIf n = 4 then either Clifford set contains three elements (Clifford triplet) or it contains five\nelements (Clifford pentad) [4].\n2\n3\n\nsee part Electroweak equations of this paper.\nFor example: http://www-d0.fnal.gov/Run2Physics/WWW/results/prelim/HIGGS/H88/H88.pdf\n\n\fHere exist only six Clifford pentads: one, which I call light pentad :\n\nThree chromatic pentads:\nthe red pentad \u03b6:\n\nthe green pentad \u03b7:\n\nthe blue pentad\u03b8:\n\ntwo gustatory pentads :\nthe sweet pentad \u0394:\n\u0394\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\nthe bitter pentad \u0393:\n\u0393\n\u0393\n\n\u0393\n\n\u0393\n\n\u0393\n\nThe light pentad contains three matrices corresponding to the coordinates of 3-dimensional\nspace, and two matrices relevant to mass terms - one for the lepton and one for the neutrino of\nthis lepton.\nEach chromatic pentad also contains three matrices corresponding to three coordinates and\ntwo mass matrices - one for top quark and another - for bottom quark.\nEach gustatory pentad contains one coordinate matrix and two pairs of mass matrices --- these\npentads are not needed yet.\n\n\fIt is proven [5] that any square-integrable 4x1-matrix function with bounded domain (Planck's\nfunction) obeys some generalization of Dirac's equation with additional gauge members. This\ngeneralization is the sum of products of the coordinate matrices of the light pentad and covariant\nderivatives of the corresponding coordinates plus product of all the eight mass matrices (two of\nlight and six of chromatic) and the corresponding mass numbers.\nIf this equation does not contain chromatic mass numbers then we obtain Dirac's equation for\nleptons with gauge members which are similar to electroweak fields. This equation is invariant\nunder electroweak transformations. The Klein-Gordon type equation with nonzero mass is\nobtained for gauge fields W and Z.\nIf this equation does not contain lepton's and neutrino's mass then we obtain the Dirac's\nequation with gauge members similar to eight gluon's fields. And oscillations of chromatic states\nof this equation bend space-time. This bend gives rise to the effects of red shift, confinement, the\naccelerated expansion of the space and asymptotic freedom, and Newtonian gravity turns out to\nbe a continuation of sub nucleonic forces.\nIf probability of a pointlike event is limited in space-time then density of that probability at\ncertain instant of time is represented as a square of 4x1 complex matrix Planck's function which\nobeys an equation of Dirac's type.\n\nPointlike events\nEvents which are expressed by sentences of shape \"In time instant x0 event A has coordinates \"\nis written as the following: \"\n\". Such events are called pointlike events. In that case a\nphysical event is ensemble of pointlike events.\nMoreover, denote:\n\u220a\nLet \u1e56 be a classical probability function.\nLet A be a pointlike event, and let pA(x) be such function that for every domain D: if D \u2286 R3+1\nthen\n\nx \u00d7 pA(x) = \u1e56(A(D)).\n\n(D)d3+1\n\nIn that case pA(x) is called absolute density of probability of event A.\nIf J is the Jacobean of the following transformation:\n\nThen\n\nHence, absolute probability density is invariant under the Lorentz transformation.\nIf\n\n\fthen\nis called probability density of event A at the time instant x0.\nUnder transformation (5) this function is changed as the following:\n\nTherefore,\nis not invariant under these transformations.\nFurther I consider events A for which function \u03c1A represents the zero component of some 3+1\n- vector field jA :\n\nThis field is called a probability current vector of event A.
