P ROBLEM S ETUP\nConsider the problem of transmitting the outputs of two\ndiscrete memoryless correlated sources, (U1 , U2 ), to a central receiver through two independent discrete memoryless\nchannels with capacities C1 and C2 , respectively. The system\nmodel is shown in Figure 1. We will assume that the channels\nbelong to the same channel family, and that each channel can\nbe parametrized by a single parameter \u03b1 (e.g., the erasure\nprobability for erasure channels). The two encoders are not\nallowed to communicate. Hence they must use independent\nencoding functions, which map k input symbols (U1 and U2 )\nto n1 and n2 output symbols (X1 and X2 ), respectively. The\nrates of the encoders are given by R1 = k/n1 and R2 = k/n2 .\nThe decoder receives (Y1 , Y2 ) and makes an estimate of\n(U1 , U2 ). This joint source-channel coding problem can be\nseen to be an instance of Slepian-Wolf coding [1] in the\npresence of a noisy channel.\n\nSource 1\n\nU1\n\nR\nX1\nEncoder 1\n\nover a large set of channel parameters. Therefore, by the\nsymmetry of the problem, we assume that both the encoders\nuse identical codes of rate R (i.e., R = k/n, n1 = n2 = n).\nReliable transmission over a channel pair (\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) is possible\nas long as the Slepian-Wolf conditions (1) are satisfied.\nC1 (\u03b11 )\n\u2265 H(U1 |U2 )\nR\nC2 (\u03b12 )\n(1)\n\u2265 H(U2 |U1 )\nR\nC1 (\u03b11 ) C2 (\u03b12 )\n+\n\u2265 H(U1 , U2 )\nR\nR\nFor a given pair of encoding functions of rate R and a joint\ndecoding algorithm, a pair of channel parameters (\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) is\nachievable if the encoder/decoder combination can achieve\nan arbitrarily low probability of error for limiting blocklengths (k \u2192 \u221e). We define the achievable channel parameter\nregion (ACPR) as the set of all channel parameters which\nare achievable. Note that the ACPR is the set of all channel\nparameters for which successful recovery of the sources is\npossible for a fixed encoding rate pair (R, R). We also define\nthe Slepian-Wolf region as the set of all channel parameters\n(\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) for which (1) is satisfied. The Slepian-Wolf region for\nthe erasure channel family is shown in Figure 2. We wish to\nfind LDPC codes which result in large ACPRs, preferably the\nentire Slepian-Wolf region. Coding schemes which have large\nACPRs are desirable because, for example, such a scheme can\nminimize the outage probability for non-ergodic channels.\n\n\u000f2\n\n1\u2212H(U2 |U1 )R\n\nC1\nChannel 1\n\nY\n\nsymmetric channel condition\n\n1\n\nCorrelated\nSources\nSource 2\nFigure 1.\n\nDecoder\nU2\n\nR\nX2\nEncoder 2\n\nC2\n\nY\n\n2\n\n1\u2212H(U2 )R\n\nChannel 2\n\nSystem Model\n1\u2212H(U1 )R\n\nThe problem we consider is to design a graph based code,\nfor which a joint iterative decoder can successfully decode\nThis work was funded by the Qatar National Research Foundation.\n\n\u000f1\n1\u2212H(U1 |U2 )R\n\nFigure 2. The Slepian-Wolf region for erasure channels, for a fixed rate pair\n(R, R)\n\n\fIn this paper, we consider the following scenarios:\n1) The channels are additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)\nchannels and the source correlation is modeled through\na virtual correlation channel analogous to a binary\nsymmetric channel (BSC).\n2) The channels are erasure channels and the source correlation is modeled through erasures.\nII. BACKGROUND\nA. Prior Work\nRecently this problem has attracted attention in the area\nof wireless sensor networks. It is a specific case of the\nsensor reachback problem [2]. Although separation between\nsource and channel coding is known to be optimal for AWGN\nchannels [2], it is desirable to take a joint source-channel\ncoding approach (via direct channel coding and joint decoding\nat the receiver) [3]. When the channel parameters are known\na priori at the transmitter, graph based coding schemes have\nbeen proposed [4], [5], which provide near optimal performance under joint iterative decoding. [3], [6] discuss the\nperformance of concatenated LDGM codes under symmetric\nchannel conditions. In [7], the authors study the performance\nof Turbo codes over varying channel conditions. Even when\nthe channel parameters are known at the transmitter, it can be\nhard to design codes that perform well for symmetric channel\nconditions [8]. For the case of erasure correlated sources, our\nprevious work gives a provable capacity achieving sequence\nof codes for the erasure channel under symmetric channel\nconditions [9].\nHowever, in several practical situations, it is unrealistic for\nthe transmitters to have a priori knowledge of the channel\nparameters. A single code now needs to perform well over the\nentire Slepian-Wolf region, making the problem of designing a\ngood code even harder. In [7], [8], this problem is considered;\nhowever, the authors choose a code that performs well at one\npoint on the Slepian-Wolf region and evaluate its performance\nfor different channel parameters. As a result, the performance\nof the code is far from the optimal performance for some\nchannel parameters. In this paper, we will show that by\nchoosing an appropriate low density parity check (LDPC) code\nensemble and optimizing it to perform well at several points\non the Slepian-Wolf region, significantly better performance\ncan be obtained.\nB. The Slepian-Wolf Region\nLet I\u03b11 (X1 ; Y1 ) (I\u03b12 (X2 ; Y2 )) denote the mutual information between X1 and Y1 (X2 and Y2 ) when the underlying joint\ndistribution is parametrized by \u03b11 (\u03b12 ). The following theorem\nshows the existence of codes which have large ACPRs.\nTheorem 1: For a fixed pair of channel conditions (\u03b11 , \u03b12 ),\nwhich is not known at the transmitter, random coding with\ntypical-set decoding at the receiver can achieve an average\nprobability of error P\u0304e,\u03b11 ,\u03b12 (over all encoders with a rate R)\nbounded above by 2\u2212nr(\u03b11 ,\u03b12 ) , where\nr(\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) = min I\u03b11 (X1 ; Y1 ) \u2212 RH(U1 | U2 ),\nI\u03b12 (X2 ; Y2 ) \u2212 RH(U2 | U1 ),\n\u0001\nI\u03b11 (X1 ; Y1 ) + I\u03b12 (X2 ; Y2 ) \u2212 RH(U1 , U2 ) .\n\nHence, there exists an encoder for which the probability of\nerror\nPe,\u03b11 ,\u03b12 \u2264 2\u2212nr(\u03b11 ,\u03b12 ) .\nProof: The proof follows from standard random coding\narguments. It is omitted here due to space constraints.\nRemark 1: A simple application of Fano's inequality shows\nthat any pair of channel parameters for which r(\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) < 0\nare not achievable (the probability of error is strictly bounded\naway from zero). For binary memoryless symmetric (BMS)\nchannels, the condition r(\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) > 0 translates to the conditions in (1). So, the conditions in (1) are both necessary and\nsufficient for transmission over BMS channels.\nCorollary 1: For BMS channels, the achievable channel\nparameter region for a random code is a dense subset of the\nentire Slepian-Wolf region for limiting block-lengths.\nProof: Let S denote the Slepian-Wolf region and for n \u2208\nN, let\nAn = {(qi , ri ) | (qi , ri ) \u2208 S, qi , ri \u2208 Q, i = 1, * * * , n} .\n(n)\n\nIf Pe denotes the random variable representing the probability of error of a randomly chosen encoding map with\nblock-length n. Given \u03b4 > 0, there exists n \u2208 N such that\nn3 2\u2212nr(\u03b11 ,\u03b12 ) < \u03b4. Then,\nP(Pe(n) < \u03b4 | \u03b11 , \u03b12 ) \u2265 1 \u2212 P(Pe(n) \u2265 n3 2\u2212nr(\u03b11 ,\u03b12 ) | \u03b11 , \u03b12 )\n1\n\u2265 1 \u2212 3,\nn\nby the Markov inequality. We define the dominant exponent\nrn = min(\u03b11 ,\u03b12 )\u2208An r(\u03b11 , \u03b12 ). Then we can upper bound the\nprobability that a random code is bad for at-least one channel\npair in An by a simple union bound, which gives us\nP(Pe(n) \u2265 \u03b4) \u2264 P(Pe(n) \u2265 n3 2\u2212nrn ) \u2264 |A|n\n\n1\n1\n=\n3\nn\nn\n\n\u21d2 lim P(Pe(n) \u2265 \u03b4) = 0.\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nSo, for limiting block-lengths, a single randomly chosen code\ncan achieve a vanishing probability of error for a dense subset\nof the entire Slepian-Wolf region.\nRemark 2: Corollary 1 also holds for random linear codes.\nWe conclude that, for a given rate pair (R, R), a single\nencoder/decoder pair suffices to communicate the sources over\nall pairs of BMS channels in the Slepian-Wolf region. Thus,\none can obtain optimal performance even without knowledge\nof (\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) at the transmitter. We refer to such encoder/decoder\npairs as being universal. This means that random codes with\ntypical-set decoding are universal for BMS channels.\nRandom coding with typical-set decoding is also universal\nwith respect to channel types, since the performance of random\ncoding depends only on channel capacity. In this paper, we are\ninterested in universality with respect to channel parameters,\nfor a particular channel type.\nWhile random codes with typical-set decoding are universally good, this scheme is clearly impractical due to its\nlarge complexity. This motivates the search for low complexity\nencoding/decoding schemes which are universal. It was shown\nin [9] that codes that are good for the single user scenario\n\n\fneed not be universal for the JSCC problem considered in\nthis paper. It was conjectured in [8] that LDPC codes do not\nperform well for this problem1 . To the contrary, we show that\nproperly designed LDPC codes can have a large ACPR.\nIII. S OURCE C ORRELATION\nIn this section, we describe two possible correlation models\nbetween the sources. These models might appear restrictive,\nbut will provide sufficient insight into the design of codes that\nperform well for arbitrary correlated sources. Our analysis in\nSection IV admits general correlation models.\nA. BSC Correlation\nConsider a symmetric correlation model which can be\ndefined in terms of a single parameter. For binary sources\nU1 and U2 , this parameter is given by Pr(U1 = U2 ). It\nis useful to visualize this correlation by the presence of an\nauxiliary binary symmetric channel (BSC) with parameter\n1 \u2212 p between the sources. In other words, U2 is the output\nof a BSC with input U1 i.e., U2 = U1 + Z. Here Z is a\nBernoulli-(1 \u2212 p) random variable and can be thought of as\nan error. Let h2 (*) denote the binary entropy function. Then,\nH(U1 |U2 ) = H(U2 |U1 ) = h2 (p) and H(U1 , U2 ) = 1+h2 (p).\nThis correlation model can be incorporated into the Tanner\ngraph at the decoder (described in Section IV-B) as check\nnodes between the source bits, with a hidden node representing\nthe auxiliary random variable Z (which carries a constant loglikelihood ratio log 1\u2212p\np ) attached to the check node. For this\nscenario, the decoder does not require any side information\ni.e., it does not need to know the realization of the auxiliary\nrandom variable Z.\nB. Erasure Correlation\n\n(over the code ensemble)\nI(X1 ; X2 ) = 0.\nThis condition is clearly not satisfied when we use a systematic\nLDPC ensemble. This also explains the loss in performance\nof systematic LDPC codes when compared to Turbo codes, as\nshown in [8]. So, to ensure the independence of the transmitted\ncodewords, we use LDPC ensembles which can be represented\nby a punctured systematic encoder.\nB. LDPC Codes\nAssume that the sequences U1 and U2 are encoded using\nLDPC codes with a degree distribution pair (\u03bb, \u03c1), with a\npunctured systematic encoder. Let the fraction of punctured\n(systematic) P\nbits be \u03b3. Based on standard notation [11], we\ni\u22121\nlet \u03bb(x) =\nbe the degree distribution (from an\ni \u03bbi x\nedge perspective)\ncorresponding\nto the variable nodes and\nP\n\u03c1(x) = i \u03c1i xi\u22121 be the degree distribution (from an edge\nperspective) of the parity-check nodes in the decoding graph.\nThe coefficient \u03bbi (resp. \u03c1i ) gives the fraction of edges that\nconnect to the variable nodes (resp. parity-check nodes) of degree i. Likewise, Li (resp. Ri ) is the fraction of variable (resp.\nparity-check) nodes with degree i. Also, let V = {i | \u03bbi 6= 0}\nand P = {i | \u03c1i 6= 0} be the support sets of the variable and\nparity-check degree distributions respectively. The rate pair of\nthe two codes after puncturing is (R, R), where\n!\nR1\n\u03c1(x) dx\n1\n0\n1\u2212 R1\n.\n(2)\nR = R(\u03bb, \u03c1) =\n1\u2212\u03b3\n\u03bb(x) dx\n0\n\nThe Tanner graph [11] for the joint decoder is shown in\nFigure 3. Code 1 corresponds to the bottom half of the graph,\n\nAnother common way to model the source correlation is\nthrough erasures. Let Z be a Bernoulli-p random variable.\nThe correlation between U1 and U2 is defined by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 i.i.d. Bernoulli 12 r.v.s, if Z = 0\n(U1 , U2 ) =\n\uf8f3\nsame Bernoulli 21 r.v. U , if Z = 1\nWe have H(U1 |U2 ) = H(U2 |U1 ) = 1 \u2212 p and H(U1 , U2 ) =\n2 \u2212 p. This correlation model can be incorporated into the\nTanner graph at the decoder with the presence or absence\nof a check node between the source bits depending on the\nauxiliary random variable Z. Note that the decoder requires\nthe realization of the random variable Z (for each of the\nsource bits) as side information. This model can also be\nthought of as having two types of BSC correlation between\nthe source bits, one with parameter 0 and one with parameter\n1. The correlation parameter p determines how many bits are\ncorrelated with parameter 1.\nA. Puncturing\n\nIV. A NALYSIS\n\nIt is shown in [10] that correlated codes are suboptimal\nwhen transmitting correlated sources over independent channels. The conditions in (1) implicitly assume the use of uncorrelated codes i.e., we require the average mutual information\n1 The\n\nauthors consider only systematic LDPC codes\n\n\u03c1(x)\npermutation \u03c02\n\nb`\n\n\u03bb(x)\np\n\nf (*)\n\nbBMSC\naBMSC\n\n\u03b3\n\u03bb(x)\npermutation \u03c01\n\na`\n\n\u03c1(x)\nFigure 3.\n\nTanner Graph of an LDPC Code with source correlation\n\ncode 2 corresponds to the top half and both the codes are\nconnected by correlation nodes at the punctured bits. Let a`\nand b` denote the density2 of the messages emanating from the\nvariable nodes at iteration `, corresponding to codes 1 and 2.\nThe density evolution equations [11] can be written as follows\nh \u0010\n\u0011\ni\na`+1 = \u03b3f L (\u03c1(b` )) + (1 \u2212 \u03b3)aBMSC \u0010 \u03bb(\u03c1(a` ))\nh \u0010\n\u0011\ni\n(3)\nb`+1 = \u03b3f L (\u03c1(a` )) + (1 \u2212 \u03b3)bBMSC \u0010 \u03bb(\u03c1(b` )),\n2 Assuming that the transmission alphabet is {\u00b11}, the densities are\nconditioned on the transmission of the all one codeword (the all zero codeword\nassumption).\n\n\fP\nP \u0010(i\u22121)\n\u0010(i\u22121)\nwhere\n\u03bb(a) =\n, L(a) =\n, \u03c1(a) =\ni \u03bbi a\ni ia\nP\n\u0018(i\u22121)\n\u03c1\na\n,\na\nand\nb\nare\nthe\ndensities\nof the\ni\nBMSC\nBMSC\ni\nlikelihood ratios received from the channel. The function f\nat the correlation nodes depends on the equivalent channel corresponding to the correlation model, as described in\n[12]. For example, in the case of a BSC correlation with\nprobability p, we introduce a parity-check at the correlation\nnodes which evaluates to a Bernoulli-p random variable i.e.,\nf (a) = aBSC(p) \u0018 a. For a BEC correlation with probability p,\nthere is a parity-check at the correlation node with probability\np and with probability 1 \u2212 p there is no parity-check, so\nf (a) = (1 \u2212 p) + pa.\nUsing the error functional [11]\nZ +\nZ 0\u2212\n1 0\na(x) dx,\nE(a) =\na(x) dx +\n2 0\u2212\n\u2212\u221e\nthe residual error probability at iteration `, (e`1 , e`2 ), is computed as\n\u0010h \u0010\n\u0011\ni\n\u0011\ne`1 = E \u03b3f L (\u03c1(b` )) + (1 \u2212 \u03b3)aBMSC \u0010 L(\u03c1(a` ))\n\u0010h \u0010\n\u0011\ni\n\u0011\ne`2 = E \u03b3f L (\u03c1(a` )) + (1 \u2212 \u03b3)bBMSC \u0010 L(\u03c1(b` )) .\nFor two residual error probabilities (e1 , e2 ) and (\u1ebd1 , \u1ebd2 ), we\ndefine (e1 , e2 ) \u0016 (\u1ebd1 , \u1ebd2 ) iff e1 \u2264 \u1ebd1 and e2 \u2264 \u1ebd2 .\nC. Differential Evolution\nThroughout this section, we use x to denote an element\nof Rn and xi to denote its ith component. The correlation\nparameter p is fixed and the set of variable and parity-check\ndegrees (V and P) over which we need to optimize the degree\nprofiles \u03bb and \u03c1 are assumed to be known. We design LDPC\ncodes for this scenario using differential evolution [13], for\na design rate Rd . Differential evolution has been shown to\nprovide good results for designing LDPC codes over single\nuser channels [14].\nIn an n-dimensional search space, a fixed number of vectors\nare randomly initialized and then evolved over time, exploring the search space, to locate the minima of the objective\nfunction. Let\n(\n)\nn\nX\nn\u22121\nn\n\u2206\n= x\u2208R\nxi = 1, xi \u2265 0, i = 1, * * * , n\n\na sample x uniformly from \u2206n\u22121 , we generate uniform\nrandom variables ui \u223c U [0, 1], i = 1, 2, * * * , n \u2212 1. Define\nu0 = 0, un = 1 and let \u03c0u be the permutation that sorts (ui )\nin ascending order i.e., if i \u2264 j, then u\u03c0u (i) \u2264 u\u03c0u (j) . For\ni = 1, * * * , n, define xi = u\u03c0u (i) \u2212 u\u03c0u (i\u22121) , and x = (xi ).\nThen x has a uniform distribution over \u2206n\u22121 .\nLet C be a finite subset of channel parameters (\u03b11 , \u03b12 )\nthat correspond to the sum rate constraint of the Slepian-Wolf\nconditions for a design rate Rd . Let \u0393 : S 0 \u00d7C \u2192 [0, 1]\u00d7[0, 1],\n(x, \u03b11 , \u03b12 ) 7\u2192 (e1 , e2 ) be the function that gives the residual\nerror probability4 (using joint density evolution as described\nin Section IV-B) for each decoder, for a pair of codes with\ndegree distribution x (i.e., (x\u03bb , x\u03c1 )), when transmitted over\nchannels with parameters (\u03b11 , \u03b12 ). We use discretized density\nevolution [15] (with 9 bit linear quantization over a likelihood\nratio range [\u221220, 20]).\nFor our design, we want the code to achieve an arbitrarily\nlow probability of error on C and we want the rate of the code\n(R(x)) to be as close to the design rate (Rd ) as possible. So,\nwe define the cost function,\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nX\n\u0001\nF(x) = a * \uf8ed\n1 \u2212 1{(\u03b11 ,\u03b12 )|\u0393(x,\u03b11 ,\u03b12 )\u0016(\u03c4,\u03c4 )} \uf8f8\n(\u03b11 ,\u03b12 )\u2208C\n\n+ b * (Rd \u2212 R(x)),\nif x \u2208 S and F(x) = \u221e, if x \u2208 S 0 \\S. The rate of the code\nR(x) = R(x\u03bb , x\u03c1 ) is computed as in (2). The constants a and\nb are chosen through trial and error. The parameters chosen\nfor the designs considered in this paper are \u03c4 = 10\u22125 , a = 10\nand b = 30. The optimization is then setup as\nmin F(x).\n\nx\u2208S 0\n\nWe use a variant of differential evolution, with the following\nmutation and recombination scheme [14]. Parameter vectors\nx1 , x2 , x3 and x4 are selected at random from the current\npopulation. Let xb denote the best member of the current\npopulation. A trial vector x is generated as\nx = xb + 0.5 * (x1 \u2212 x2 + x3 \u2212 x4 ).\n\ni=1\n\ndenote the unit simplex and nv = |V|, np = |P|. Then, the\nsearch space for all variable (check) degree profiles is \u2206nv \u22121\n(\u2206np \u22121 ). The optimization is performed over the search space\nS = \u2206nv \u22121 \u00d7 \u2206np \u22121 , with parameter vectors x = [x\u03bb , x\u03c1 ]3 ,\nwhere x\u03bb \u2208 \u2206nv \u22121 , x\u03c1 \u2208 \u2206np \u22121 .\nIn our optimization procedure,\nwe expand\nP\nP the search space\nto S 0 = {x \u2208 Rnv +np , i (x\u03bb )i = 1, i (x\u03c1 )i = 1}, for\nsimplicity in the crossover stage.\nFor the optimization to work well, differential evolution\nrequires an initial population of trial vectors which are spread\nout uniformly across the search space. We generate an initial\npopulation of trial degree distributions by uniformly sampling\nthe degree distributions from the unit simplex. To obtain\n3 (x , V) and (x , P) correspond to the variable and parity node degree\n\u03c1\n\u03bb\nprofiles respectively.\n\nV. R ESULTS AND C ONCLUDING R EMARKS\nWe showed that the Slepian-Wolf conditions are necessary\nand sufficient for communication of correlated sources through\nindependent BMS channels, without channel state information\nat the transmitter. This implies that a single random code is\nsufficient to communicate with vanishing probability of error,\nfor the entire Slepian-Wolf region.\nWe designed punctured systematic LDPC codes for the\nscenarios described in Section III. The design was performed\nto maximize the ACPR, in contrast to previous work. The\nresults are given below.\n4 We set the maximum number of iterations to 100 for all the designs\nconsidered in this paper. Density evolution is stopped when the maximum\nnumber of iterations are reached or the difference in the residual error\nprobability between successive iterations is less than 10\u22128 .\n\n\f1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n\n\u000f2\n\nA. BSC Correlation\nWe optimized the degree profiles for BSC correlated sources\nusing the procedure described in Section IV-C, for transmission over the AWGN channel. The source correlation\nparameter was p = 0.9 and the optimization was performed\nfor a design rate Rd = 0.5 after puncturing, resulting in the\nfollowing degree profiles\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n\n\u03bb(x) = 0.14895x + 0.3963x2 + 0.13192x3 + 0.18799x6\n8\n\n+ 0.0050071x + 0.064285x\n3\n\n14\n\n0.2\n\n19\n\n+ 0.065546x ,\n\n5\n\n\u03c1(x) = 0.64719x + 0.13662x + 0.14429x\n\n14\n\n0.1\n\n24\n\n+ 0.071903x .\n\nThe ACPR for this code is shown in Figure 4. Also\nshown in the figure is the Slepian-Wolf region for the\nrate pair (0.282, 0.282), which has a transmission rate\npair (0.423, 0.423) after puncturing. These results show\nthat ensembles optimized using differential evolution almost\nachieve the entire Slepian-Wolf region. For a rate pair of\n(0.423, 0.423), the best (theoretical) achievable signal to noise\nratio (SNR) for symmetric channel conditions is \u22122.68 dB.\nThe optimized code can perform well, for symmetric channel\nconditions, up-to an SNR of \u22121.82 dB, which is at a gap of\n0.86 dB from the theoretical limit.\n3\n2\n1\n\nSNR2 (dB)\n\n0\n\u22121\n\u22122\n\u22123\n\u22124\n\u22125\n\u22126\n\u22126\n\n\u22125\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22122 \u22121\nSNR1 (dB)\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nFigure 4.

Erasure Correlation\nWe use the procedure described in Section IV-C to design\nLDPC codes for the erasure channel, when the sources are\ncorrelated with an erasure probability of p = 0.5. The\noptimization was performed for a design rate of Rd = 0.57\nafter puncturing, resulting in the following degree profiles\n\u03bb(x) = 0.3633x + 0.2834x2 + 0.2315x6 + 0.1217x19 ,\n\u03c1(x) = 0.531776x3 + 0.468224x5 .\nThe ACPR for this code is shown in Figure 5. Also\nshown in the figure is the Slepian-Wolf region for the rate\npair (0.3308, 0.3308) which has a transmission rate pair\n(0.4962, 0.4962) after puncturing. These results show that ensembles optimized using differential evolution almost achieve\nthe entire Slepian-Wolf region.\nC. Future Work\nThe main motivation for this research was to answer the following question: Do code ensembles exist which can simultaneously achieve the entire Slepian-Wolf region under message\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n\u000f1\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\nFigure 5. ACPR (Density Evolution threshold) of an optimized (erasure\nchannel) LDPC Code of rate 0.3308\n\npassing decoding? This question still remains unanswered.\nAlthough classical LDPC codes can have a large ACPR, it is\nstill not clear if they can be universal or if they are strictly subuniversal. There also seems to be a complexity-universality\ntrade-off at the decoder, which needs to be addressed.\nR EFERENCES\n[1] D. Slepian and J.
