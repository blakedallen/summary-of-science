Introduction\nThe polar molecule HCN (dipole moment 2.98 debye) is\ncommonly used as a tracer of dense molecular gas, i.e. gas\nat n(H2 ) \u2265 104 cm\u22123 . In particular in distant luminous\n(LIR > 1011 L\u2299 , LIRGs) and ultraluminous (LIR > 1012\nL\u2299 , ULIRGs) systems the HCN 1\u20130 line is the prototypical tracer of dense gas content (e.g., Solomon et al. 1992;\nHelfer & Blitz 1993; Curran et al. 2000 (CAB)). Solomon\net al. (1992) find a tighter correlation between FIR and\nHCN luminosity than the one found between FIR and CO.\nThey suggest that, in general, the IR luminosities originate from star formation rather than AGN activity in FIR\nluminous galaxies. The HCN to CO intensity ratio, how1\never, varies substantially ( 31 - 40\n) among luminous galaxies, and it is unclear whether this difference can simply\nbe interpreted as variations in the dense gas content or\nSend offprint requests to: S. Aalto\n\nis also due to abundance and/or excitation effects. Apart\nfrom being collisionally excited, HCN may become excited\nvia electron collisions (at X(e) \u2248 10\u22125 ) or be pumped\nby 14 \u03bcm continuum radiation through vibrational transitions in its degenerate bending mode. It is also difficult\nto know if the gas is really engaged in star formation, or\nif it is simply dense in response to being near the central\npotential of the galaxy (e.g., Helfer & Blitz 1993; Aalto et\nal. 1995) where other mechanisms (AGN, turbulence etc)\nmay heat the gas and dust.\nIn order to understand the activities in the centers of\nluminous galaxies it is essential to also understand the\nprevailing conditions of the dense gas. Apart from observing higher transitions of HCN it is important also\nto study the emission from other high density tracers.\nOne such tracer is the HNC molecule, the isomer of (and\nchemically linked to) HCN. For example, at high temperatures HNC can be transferred into HCN via the reaction\n\n\f2\n\nS. Aalto, A. G. Polatidis, S. H\u00fcttemeister, S. J. Curran: CN,HNC in Galaxies\n\nHNC + H \u2192 HCN + H. It is predicted, e.g. in (maybe\noversimplified) chemical steady state models, but also by\nshock models, that the HCN\nHNC ratio increases with increasing temperature and gas density (e.g., Schilke et al. 1992\n(S92)). This is supported by the fact that the measured\nHCN\nHNC abundance ratio is especially high in the vicinity of\nthe hot core of Orion KL. Most of the temperature dependence is between 10 and 50 K, after which there is a\nconsiderable flattening (S92).\nCompared to these results, the HCN\nHNC intensity ratios\nfound (so far) in nearby starburst galaxies are rather low\n(ranging from 1-5) closer to dark clouds than to hot cores\n(H\u00fcttemeister et al. 1995 (H95)). This result is in apparent\ncontradiction with the idea that the gas is warm (T >\n\u223c 50 K)\nin the centers of starburst galaxies (e.g., Wild et al. 1992;\nWall et al.1993). However, Aalto et al. (1995) suggest that\nthe dense cores of the molecular clouds of the starburst\nNGC 1808 are cold (10 K) and thus these cores could\nbe responsible for the HNC emission in NGC 1808, but\npossibly also in other galaxies.\nThe radical CN is another tracer of dense gas, with\na somewhat lower (by a factor of 5) critical density\nthan HCN. Observations of the CN emission towards the\nOrion A molecular complex (Rodriguez-Franco et al. 1998)\nshow that the morphology of the CN emission is dominated by the ionization fronts of the HII regions. The\nauthors conclude that this molecule is an excellent tracer\nof regions affected by UV radiation. Thus, the emission\nfrom the CN molecule should serve as a measure of the\nrelative importance of gas in Photon Dominated Regions\n(PDRs).\nWe have searched for HNC and CN emission in\na sample of LIRG and ULIRG galaxies with warm\n(60 \u03bcm) >\n( ff(100\n\u03bcm) \u223c 0.75) FIR colours. We were interested to see\nwhether the HNC emission would be relatively fainter\ncompared to the cooler, nearby objects studied by H95. Is\nHNC a reliable cold gas tracer, or would we find evidence\nfor the contrary? We furthermore wanted to assess the relative importance of dense PDRs in these objects through\ncomparing the CN line brightness with that of HCN. If indeed the HNC emission is a tracer of the amount of cold,\ndense gas, then perhaps an anti-correlation between the\nCN and HNC emission is to be expected. Many of the\ngalaxies in the survey are powered by prodigious rates of\nstar formation and thus a bright CN line relative to that\nHCN is to be expected. Some of the galaxies are dominated by an AGN where the expected CN brightness may\nalso be high (e.g., Krolik & Kallman 1983).\nIn Sect. 2, we present the observations and in Sect. 3\nthe results in terms of line intensities and line ratios. In\nSect. 4.1 we discuss the interpretation of the HNC results\nand in Sect. 4.2 we discuss CN. In 4.3 possible connections to starburst evolution and scenarios of the possibly\ndominating gas components are discussed.\n\nTable 1.

Observations\nWe have used the SEST and OSO 20m to measure the\nHNC 1-0 (90.663 GHz) and the CN 1-0 113.491 GHz (10, J=3/2-1/2, F =5/2-3/2) line intensity in a selection\nof 13 LIRGs and ULIRGs. We also include observations\nof NGC 1808 which is of lower luminosity. The selected\nI(CO)\n1-0 intensity ratios <\ngalaxies all have global I(HCN)\n\u223c 15\n(apart from NGC 3256 and NGC 1808). For the southern galaxies observed with SEST, we were also able to\nmeasure the CN 2-1 line (226.874 GHz (2-1, J=5/2-3/2,\nF =7/2-5/2), 226.659 GHz (2-1 J=3/2-1/2 F=5/2-3/2)).\nThe CN 1-0 113.191 GHz line (1-0 J=1/2-1/2 F=3/2-3/2)\nis shifted +806 km s\u22121 from the main line and we have obtained limits to its intensity in several cases. For Arp 220\nthe two CN 1-0 spingroups are blended because the line\nis so broad. Thus, even in the 1 GHz correlator backend\n(see below) it was necessary to observe CN 1-0 at two different LO settings and then join the spectra together to\nget enough baseline. For four galaxies the bandwidth was\nwide enough to also include the 90.983 GHz 10-9 line of\nHC3 N.\nObservations were made in 1999 October (HNC,\nOSO), December (HNC, SEST) and 2000 June (CN,\nOSO), August (CN, SEST). For OSO, the system temperatures were typically 300 K for HNC and 500-600\nK for CN. For SEST, typical system temperatures were\n230 K for the HNC measurements and 400 K for both the\n113 GHz and the 226 GHz CN observations. Pointing was\nchecked regularly on SiO masers and the rms was found\nto be 2\u2032\u2032 for OSO, and 3\u2032\u2032 for SEST. Arp 220 was observed\nboth with OSO (CN) and SEST (HNC). We have also\nmeasured the 115 GHz CO 1-0 and the HCN 1-0 lines for\nsome galaxies where we did not have values from the literature. Beamsizes and efficiencies are shown in Table 1.\nFor the OSO observations a 500 MHz filterbank was used\nfor backends for all observations, and for some a 1 GHz\nautocorrelator was also used. For the SEST observations\nwe alternated between a 500 MHz and 1 GHz backend depending on whether simultaneous observations with the 1\nand 3 mm receiver were taking place. We used the software\npackage xs (written by P. Bergman) to subtract baselines\nand add spectra.\n\n3. Results\n\n\fS. Aalto, A. G. Polatidis, S. H\u00fcttemeister, S. J.

HNC line intensities and ratios\nThe line intensities are presented in Table 2 and the ratios in Table 3. CO spectra are presented in Figure 1 and\nHNC spectra (plus a SEST HCN spectrum for Arp 220)\nin Figure 2. For some of the galaxies the center velocity vc is put to 0. This is because the observer in that\ncase chose to set the velcocity to zero and work with the\nredshifted frequency instead. The velocity used to calculate the redshifted frequency (thus the velocity the band\nwas centered on) can be found in Table 2. All galaxies,\n11\nexcept NGC 1808, have FIR luminosities LFIR >\nL\u2299\n\u223c 10\n(see Table 3). Five of the investigated sources (Mrk 231,\nNGC 7469, NGC 2623, IC 694 and NGC 7130) have global\nHCN\nHNC luminosity ratios close to unity. The rest have ratios ranging from 2 to >\n\u223c 6. The HNC luminous objects\nare all AGNs (three Seyferts, one LINER (NGC 2623))\nexcept for IC 694 which we suspect is a starburst (e.g.,\nPolatidis & Aalto 2000), but there are also Seyfert galaxies with faint HNC emission (such as Mrk 273, NGC 6240\nand NGC 34). We do not find that an increase in FIR luminosity is followed by an increase in HCN\nHNC line intensity\n\nratio. Instead, there might be a weak trend to the opposite\nand two (Mrk 231 and Arp 220) of the three ULIRGs in\nour sample have relatively bright HNC emission (see Sect.\n3.1.1).\n\n3.1.1. Comparisons with other HNC surveys\nIn the H95 HNC survey of nearby starburst galaxies, the\nmajority of the sources show HCN\nHNC line ratios greater than\nor equal to two. Three objects have I(HCN)\u2248 I(HNC):\nthe nearby starburst NGC 253, the nearby post-starburst\nNGC 7331 and the Seyfert NGC 3079. For most of the\ngalaxies in that sample, the line ratios are not global, but\nreflect the conditions in the inner 0.2 - 1 kpc of the galaxy.\nSince both the HCN and CO emission for most of our\nsample galaxies comes from the inner kpc (e.g., Bryant\n1996; Scoville et al. 1997; Downes & Solomon 1998; Bryant\n& Scoville 1999), it is meaningful to compare the HCN\nHNC\nHCN\nratios of the two samples. In H95 the average HNC\nline\nintensity ratio is 2 for 14 galaxies (excluding limits and\ntheir value for Arp 220 (see below)). In our sample, the\nratio is somewhat lower, 1.6, when only detections are\n\n\f4\n\nS. Aalto, A. G. Polatidis, S. H\u00fcttemeister, S. J. Curran: CN,HNC in Galaxies\n\nTable 3.

The Bryant (1996) ratios are measured with the\nOVRO interferometer, but since both the CO and HCN emission is compact for both NGC 2623 and NGC 6240 the line ratios\nare global and can be compared with single dish ratios. For Arp 299 (IC 694 & NGC 3690) the situation is more complicated\nsince the high density tracer emission is emerging from compact structures, while a fraction of the CO emission comes from\nmore extended gas (e.g., Aalto et al. 1997). In (Solomon et al. 1992) HCN was measured in a 28\u2032\u2032 beam (IRAM).\nc): We have not mapped the CN line emission which is of course necessary for an accurate determination of the CN 2\u22121\nline\n1\u22120\nratio. For most galaxies we expect the CN distribution to be effectively a point source in the beam - except for NGC 1808\nwhere we adopt a source size of 18\u2032\u2032 (Aalto et al. 1995).\nd): The FIR luminosities come from Bryant (1996) (apart from NGC 1808 (Aalto et al. 1994); NGC 34 (CAB); NGC 3256,\nNGC 7130, NGC 2146 (Aalto et al. 1991))\ne): We have assumed that the HNC emission is a point source (see footnote b) and recalculated the line intensity to that of the\n28\u2032\u2032 IRAM HCN beam.\nf): Line ratios are not global, but apply only for the inner 2-3 KPC.\ng): We use the temperature line ratio of 2 instead of the integrated line ratio of 1 given in CAB (because the HCN line appear\ntoo broad).\nh): There is an error in table 4 of CAB. The correct ratio (8) can be found in table 3 in CAB.\n\nincluded (but when limits are included the ratio increases\nto 2). Joining the H95 galaxies with ours in one sample\nwe still can find no strong trend in the line ratio with\nincreasing FIR luminosity. We note, however, that we have\na larger number of galaxies with ratios close to unity (6)\ncompared to H95 (3) despite our smaller sample.\nWe observed HNC in Arp 220 to see if we could reproduce the remarkable result in H95 that HNC was brighter\nthan HCN. We observed HNC on two consecutive days,\nwith observations of HCN in between, but could not confirm the bright HNC emission found earlier. Instead we\nHCN\nobtain an HNC\nintensity ratio of 1.4, which is more consistent with results found in other galaxies.\n\n3.1.2. HC3 N\nFor some galaxies the bandwidth was large enough to include the HC3 N 10-9 line, shifted in velocity by -1000\nkm s\u22121 from the HNC line. The line is detected in Arp 220\nat 40% of the HNC 1-0 intensity. In NGC 1808 the line is\ntentatively detected at 16% of the HNC 1-0 intensity and\n\nin NGC 7130 and NGC 3256 we have upper limits to the\nline (see footnote to Table 2).\n\n3.2. CN line ratios and intensities\nCN 1-0: The line intensities are presented in Table 2 and\nthe ratios in Table 3. The CN 1-0 spectra are displayed in\nFigure 3. For most of the galaxies we only detect one of\nthe spingroups in the 1-0 transition. Because of the broad\nline in Arp 220 the two groups are however blended -\neven though they are separated by 800 km s\u22121 . Also for\nNGC 6240 the second spingroup is somewhat blended with\nthe first one.\nThe HCN\nCN 1-0 integrated line ratio varies substantially: from 0.5 to greater than four. I(CN) >\n\u223c I(HCN) in\nthree objects (Arp 220, NGC 3690 and NGC 1808), while\nCN remains undetected in IC 694, Mrk 273, NGC 34\nand NGC 2623. We also find three galaxies (Mrk 231,\nNGC 2623, and IC 694) where I(CN) <\n\u223c I(HNC). In four\ngalaxies (Arp 220, NGC 1808, NGC 3256, NGC 6240)\nI(HNC) < I(CN) - three are starburst galaxies and\n\n\fS. Aalto, A. G. Polatidis, S. H\u00fcttemeister, S. J. Curran: CN,HNC in Galaxies\n\nNGC 6240 is classified as a Seyfert. In H95, CN was\nbrighter than HNC in all four sample galaxies where CN\nwas measured.\nThe HCN\nCN line intensity ratio seems to increase slightly\nwith FIR luminosity. Dividing our galaxies into two luminosity bins we find that the average ratio of 1.5 for the\nlower luminosity galaxies and 2.3 for the higher luminosity objects. This, somewhat surprising, result is discussed\nin Sect. 4.2. We included NGC 3690 in the lower luminosity batch since most of the FIR emission is believed to\noriginate in IC 694.\nCN 2-1: The 2-1 spectra are presented in Figure 4.\nBoth 2-1 spingroups are detected in four of the cases (in\nNGC 6240 the blending is severe). In NGC 34 and in\nNGC 1614 we detect only the brighter J=5/2-3/2 transition. The CN 2\u20131 spectrum of Arp 220 shows a much\nweaker line than the 1\u20130 spectrum, and emission is only\ndetected in the lower velocity part (vc \u2248 5200 km s\u22121 )\nof the spectrum. Also the CN 1-0 line peaks around 5200\nkm s\u22121 . The CO emission peaks at vc \u2248 5400 km s\u22121 . This\nimplies that most of the CN emission emerges from the\nwestern nucleus (see Scoville et al. 1997). The HC3 N line\non the other hand appears to peak at vc = 5550 km s\u22121 ,\nand thus most of the emission likely emerges from the\neastern nucleus. This tentative velocity difference should\nbe investigated at higher resolution.\n\n5\n\n4. Discussion\nWe initially expected that the relative HNC luminosity\nwould be lower in our sample of warm, luminous galaxies\ncompared to the H95 sample. Instead (see Sect. 3.1.1) the\nvery luminous galaxies even seemed to be somewhat more\nluminous, on average, in HNC even though this change is\nnot statistically significant. A possibility could be that the\ntelescope beam is picking up more extended, cooler gas in\nthe distant, more luminous, galaxies. However, most of\nthem are known to have very compact molecular cloud\ndistributions and it is unlikely that significant HNC emission emerges from the outskirts of the galaxies. Our results\nseem to challenge the notion of HNC as a reliable tracer\nof cold gas.\nHCN\nFurthermore, the variation in HNC\nline ratio is large\namong the galaxies that otherwise have similar properties.\nCO\n1-0 intensity raFor example, despite having similar HCN\ntios, Mrk 273 and Mrk 231 have quite different HCN\nHNC and\nHCN\nHCN\nCN line intensity ratios. The HNC ratio of Mrk 231 is\nclose to unity, while HNC is not detected in Mrk 273 re>\nsulting in a HCN\nHNC ratio \u223c 6. It is unlikely that the dense gas\nis cold in Mrk 231 but warm in Mrk 273 (both are hot,\nultraluminous AGN/Starburst mergers) and therefore the\ninterpretation of HNC needs to be reevaluated.\n\n4.1. Why is HNC often bright in centers of galaxies?\n3.2.1. The CN\n\n2\u22121\n1\u22120\n\nratio\n\n2\u22121\n1\u22120\n\nline intensity ratio (see footnote to Table 3\nThe CN\non how it was calculated) suggests the CN emission being subthermally excited apart from in NGC 6240 (and\nNGC 34 with an upper limit to the CN 1-0 emission). In\ngeneral the ratio is lower than 0.4 indicating gas densities\n4\n<\ncm\u22123 (Fuente et al. 1995) which are about one\n\u223c 5 \u00d7 10\norder of magnitude below the critical density.\n\n3.2.2. The CN spingroup ratio\nWe can use the 1mm spingroup ratio to estimate the average optical depth of the two lines. The ratio between\nthe lines is quite large, >2 for all cases where it can be\nmeasured. The spingroup ratios are very accurate since\nthey were obtained at the same time (apart from possible baseline errors). In NGC 6240 the line blending is so\nsevere that the ratio is difficult to determine. The LTE ratio should be close to 1.8 (Bachiller et al. 1997) and ratios\naround 2 thus indicate that the lines are of low optical\ndepth. For most galaxies, the other spingroup of the 1-0\nline (around 113.191 GHz (J=1/2-1/2)) was outside the\nobserved bandwidth. In the optically thin case, this line\nis about 1/3 of the J=3/2-1/2 at 113.490. For Arp 220,\nthe two lines are blended (see above) and we fitted two\ngaussians each centered on one of the spingroups. The fits\nshows that a line intensity ratio between the two lines of\n1/3 is possible.\n\nThere are a number of possible explanations. Let us examine them one by one and see how they can be tested:\n1. The dense gas is cold.\nIs it possible that a significant fraction of the dense gas\nis cold in centers of starburst galaxies? Possibly. Aalto et\nal. (1994) discuss the presence of cold dense gas in the\n\"mild\" starburst galaxy NGC 1808. The high dust temperatures observed towards NGC 1808 could be explained\nby clouds with hot surfaces and cold interiors. In this scenario, the HNC 1-0 emission would emerge from the cold\ncloud cores, while HCN 1-0 emission also would come from\nthe outer, warmer parts. Gas at densities > 105 cm\u22123\nshould become thermalized with the dust. Thus, if the\nHNC emission is coming from dense, cold (10-20 K) gas\nthere should be submm dust continuum emission associated with it. Therefore, a study of the submm and mm\nexcess in conjunction with the strength of the HNC emission should be quite interesting. However, the most HNC\nluminous object in our sample, Mrk 213, shows very weak\nmm thermal dust emission and Braine & Dumke (1998)\nfind a dust temperature of 70 K - the kinetic temperature of the associated dense gas should be at least as high.\nThis is not consistent with the idea that the HNC emission arises from a cold component. Based on ISOPHOT\ndata Klaas et al. (1997) find that the bulk of the dust\nmass in Arp 220 is at a temperature of about 50 K. Thus,\nthe bright HNC 1-0 emission is unlikely originate in cold\ncloud cores.\nWe conclude that for objects like Mrk 231 and Arp 220,\nwhere there is no mm excess emission, and where the over-\n\n\f6\n\nS.

However, for less extreme objects such as\nNGC 1808 there could be enough mass in cold cores that\nat least a fraction of the HNC emission could emerge from\nthem.\n2. Chemistry.\nSteady state chemistry models by S92 show both a\ntemperature and a density dependence in the [HCN]\n[HNC] abundance ratio. For example, there is a very significant difference between n(H2 )=104 cm\u22123 and 107 cm\u22123 . For Tkin =\n[HCN]\n[HCN]\n=0.8 for 104 and [HNC]\n=67 for 107 . If the bulk\n50 K, [HNC]\n\nof the HCN and HNC emission is emerging from gas of\ndensities 104 \u2212105 then the relative HNC abundance there\nmay be substantial, despite the high temperature. The\nreason for this is that at lower densities reactions with\n+\nHCNH+ (HCN and HNC reacts with H+\n3 to form HCNH )\nbecome more important. The ion abundance is higher and\nonce HCN and HNC become protonised, HCNH+ will recombine to produce either HCN or HNC with 50% probability. At higher densities, the ion abundance is likely\nlower and reactions like HNC + O \u2192 CO + NH become\nmore important at high temperatures. This scenario is interesting since the electron and ion abundance is likely\n\n\fS. Aalto, A. G. Polatidis, S. H\u00fcttemeister, S. J.

Therefore, in a PDR chemistry, the connection between HNC abundance and kinetic temperature\nmay also be weak since we there expect the HCNH+ reac2\u22121\nratios we measure\ntions to be important. Since the CN 1\u22120\nindicate subthermal excitation it is reasonable to assume\nthat most of the HCN,HNC and CN emission is indeed\nemerging from gas where the density is below 105 cm\u22123 .\n3. Optical depth effects\nIn Orion, S92 find peak-to-peak intensity ratios between HCN\nHNC of 3 to 4 towards the hot core and ridge.\nHowever, the abundance ratio is much higher, \u224880. Thus,\nit is possible that the fairly bright HNC emission in some\ngalaxy centers is caused by optical depth effects. In objects\nwhere the HCN emission is subthermally excited (like in\nMrk 231) the optical depth of the 1-0 line could be quite\nhigh and perhaps explain part of the apparently too-bright\nHNC.\n4. IR pumping\n\nBoth HCN and HNC may be pumped by an intense\nmid-IR radiation field boosting the emission from low density regions. There has been no direct evidence IR pumping is dominating the HCN excitation in external galaxies. However, Barvainis et al. (1997) suggest IR pumping as a possible mechanism behind the HCN emission\nof the Cloverleaf quasar. Ultraluminous galaxies, such as\nMrk 231 and Arp 220, have central mid-IR sources with\noptically thick radiation temperatures well in excess of\nthose necessary to pump the HCN molecule (Soifer et al.\n1999). For HNC the coupling to the field is even stronger\nthan for HCN, thus increasing the probability for IR\npumping in extreme galaxies, such as Mrk 231. Even if\nthe HNC abundance is lower compared to HCN the HNC\nemission may have a higher filling factor due to the IR\npumping (if it allows emission from gas clouds otherwise\nat too low density to excite the HNC molecule). A comparative excitation study of HCN and HNC would help\n\n\f8\n\nS. Aalto, A. G. Polatidis, S. H\u00fcttemeister, S. J.

CN 2-1 spectra for the galaxies with detections. The scale is in TA\u2217 . The band is centered in between the two\nspingroups, apart from Arp 220, where the spectrometer was centered on the J=5/2-3/2 line. The two spingroups are\nmarked with arrows and are blended for all galaxies, apart from NGC 7130. FOR Arp 220 emission is not detected at\nthe line center (marked by the arrow) instead, there is a tentative detection at V =5170 km s\u22121 (blueshifted from Vc\nby approximately 250 km s\u22121 ). The velocity resolution ranges from 10 to 50 km s\u22121 . It was selected to be 10% of the\nFWHM of the line itself, but for a few cases the S/N of the spectrum required further smoothing.\nRodriguez-Franco et al. 1998). The abundance of the CN\nradical becomes enhanced at the inner edge of a PDR (at\nan AV of about 2 magnitudes) via the reaction N + C2 \u2192\nCN+C or via N+CH \u2192 CN+H. At larger depths into the\ncloud the CN abundance radically declines and the [HCN]\n[CN]\nabundance ratio increases (Jansen et al. 1995). Most of the\nCN is present in a part of the cloud where the abundance\nof free electrons is rather large, X(e) \u2248 3\u00d710\u22125. CN is also\na photodissociation product of HCN. Thus the CN abundance should be favoured in a molecular cloud ensemble\ndominated by PDRs. Furthermore, chemical models (e.g.,\nKrolik & Kallman 1983; Lepp & Dalgarno 1996) show that\nthe CN abundance should also be enhanced when the Xray ionization rates are high - as might be the case near\nan AGN.\n\nIt is of course difficult to translate a measured HCN\nCN 1-0\nline intensity ratio to an abundance ratio between the two\nspecies. The spingroup line ratios (see Sect. 3.2.1.) show\nthat the CN 2-1 emission is optically thin for most galaxies we have measured. The emission of the CN molecule is\ndistributed in a greater number of transitions than HCN,\nthus the optical depth per transition is often lower for CN,\nreducing the intensity per line. The CN luminosity then\nbecomes a measure of the total number of CN molecules\n(at least in a comparative sense, given a constant excitation situation from galaxy to galaxy). For the CN 1-0 line\nwe have only information for Arp 220 where the relative\nfaintness of the second spingroup suggests that the optical\ndepth of the 1-0 line is also low. So, the measured (total)\nHCN\nCN line intensity ratio will give a reasonable idea of the\nabundance ratio if also the HCN line is close to being op-\n\n\f10\n\nS. Aalto, A. G. Polatidis, S. H\u00fcttemeister, S. J. Curran: CN,HNC in Galaxies\n\ntically thin (and a lower limit to the abundance ratio if\nit is not) and if the same excitation temperature can be\nassumed. The critical density of the CN line is lower by a\nfactor of a few, so its Tex is likely somewhat higher.\n\n4.2.2. AGNs or starbursts?\nThere are only a few galaxies where I(CN) >\n\u223c I(HCN)\n(Arp 220, NGC 3690 and NGC 1808) - all three are\nstarburst galaxies. For these galaxies N (CN) is greater\nthan N (HCN) and the dense gas is to a large degree affected by photodissociation. The most extreme example\nis NGC 3690 where the CN line is on average more than\na factor of two brighter than HCN. In Arp 220 the CN\nappears to be bright only towards the western of the two\nnuclei (Sect. 3.2). This is interesting, since the situation is\nsimilar for the IC 694/NGC 3690 system: bright CN emission towards one of the galaxy nuclei only. It is interesting\nto speculate on whether the burst towards NGC 3690 is\nolder than the one in IC 694 because of the development\nof the PDRs. However, the IC 694 burst is more compact\nand it is possible that the actual properties of the ISM are\nintrinsically different.\nWe were surprised to find that CN was difficult to\ndetect in several of the brightest galaxies like Mrk 273,\nNGC 2623, NGC 6240, IC 694 and NGC 34. Four of these\ngalaxies are AGNs and it is tempting to speculate that\nthe CN deficiency is related to the nuclear activity. This\nseems contrary to models (see above) which predict an increase in the CN abundance in an X-ray chemistry. High\nresolution studies of nearby systems which contain both\nstarburst and AGN activity (like NGC 1068) will reveal\nwhether CN emission is associated with one or both of the\nactivities.\n\n4.2.3. The CN and the [C II] 158 \u03bcm line\nIn ULIRGs such as Arp 220 and Mrk 231 the [C II] 158\n\u03bcm fine structure line is found to be abnormally faint compared to other, less FIR luminous, starburst galaxies like\nNGC 3690 (e.g., Luhman et al. 1998). This is interesting,\nsince one would expect the emission from a standard PDR\ntracer, like the [C II] line, to be bright in a galaxy that\nis believed to be powered largely by mighty starbursts.\nF\nwith increasMalhotra reports a decreasing trend in F[CII]\nFIR\nf (60)\nf (100)\n\n\u03bcm flux ratio.\nSeveral possible explanations for the [C II] faintness are\nbrought forward (e.g., Malhotra et al. 1997; Luhman et al.\n1998; van der Werf 2001). The PDRs may be quenched in\nthe high pressure, high density environment in the deep\npotentials of the ULIRGs and the HII regions exist in\nforms of small-volume, ultracompact HII regions that are\ndust-bounded. The [C II] line may become saturated either in low density (n \u221d 102 cm\u22123 ) regions of very high\nUV fields (G0 \u221d 103 ) or in dense (n \u221d 105 cm\u22123 ) regions of more moderate UV fields (G0 = 5 \u2212 10). A soft\nUV field from an aging starburst is another possibility. A\ning\n\nhigher dust-to-gas ratio would also decrease the expected\nF[CII]\nFFIR ratio.\nThe molecular ISM of ULIRGs seems to be characterized by subthermally excited CO and very bright emission from HCN (e.g., Downes & Solomon 1998; Aalto et\nal. 1995; Solomon et al. 1992). Crudely, this can be modelled as dense clouds (n = 104 \u2212 105 cm\u22123 ) embedded in\na low density (n = 100 \u2212 500 cm\u22123 ) continous medium.\nThis simple scenario may fit well with the two scenarios\nresulting in saturated [C II] emission.\nWe have three ULIRGs in our sample: Arp 220,\nMrk 231 and Mrk 273 their HCN\nCN line intensity ratio\nchanges from 1 to >\n6.\nThe\ndeficiency\nof CN in Mrk 273\n\u223c\nis consistent with the lack of [C II] emission and can be\nan indication that the PDRs are not forming in the dense\ngas. In Arp 220 the CN emission from the western nucleus\nis strong and an indicator that a fair fraction of the dense\ngas is in fact in a PDR state. The UV radiation is strongly\naffecting the dense molecular clouds here. Clearly we need\nmore information on the properties of the dense gas there\nto find an explanation for the lack of [C II] emission.\n\n4.3. Line ratios and starburst evolution\nWe speculate whether line ratios of dense gas tracers can\nbe used to explore the evolutionary stage of a starburst.\nThe observed galaxies can be sorted into rough categories\nbased on their line ratios.\n\n4.3.1. Warm dense gas - a young starburst or shocks?\nObjects that show bright HCN emission, but little or no\nHNC or CN, may be dominated by warm dense gas early\nin their starburst development. The Orion KL region is\nan example of a Galactic warm (T >\n\u223c 50 K), dense core\nwhere I(HCN) is significantly greater than both I(CN)\nand I(HNC) (e.g., Ungerechts et al. 1997). Also the emission from the 10-9 transition of HC3 N is brighter than\nthe CN and HNC emission which is a typical signature\nof warm, dense gas. However, shocked gas may be an important part of the molecular ISM in the center of a starburst galaxy - in particular if there is a bar in the center\nwhere clouds on intersecting orbits collide. The interaction between supernova remnants at the surrounding ISM\nmay also lead to the presence of shocked gas. The effect\nof the shock is to compress and heat the gas, which in\nsome respects will make it look like an ISM dominated by\nwarm dense cores. The major difference is that the shock,\npartially or fully, destroys the dust grains and thereby releasing molecules, such as SiO, into the ISM. Therefore,\nSiO emission is often used as a tracer of shocked gas (e.g.,\nMartin-Pintado et al. 1992). If the shocked gas is allowed\nto cool after the shock (which may happen quickly since\nit has been compressed) the HNC abundance will increase\nrapidly (S92). An example of a galaxy that could have\na shock dominated ISM is NGC 6240. Very strong IR\nemission is emerging from shock-excited H2 (van der Werf\n\n\fS. Aalto, A. G. Polatidis, S. H\u00fcttemeister, S. J. Curran: CN,HNC in Galaxies\n\n2001) in between the two merger nuclei and both HNC\nand CN line emission is faint relative to that of HCN. In\na high pressure environment the gas may be dense and\nwarm - but perhaps heated by dissipation of turbulence\nrather than very young embedded stars. This may not occur during the very early stages of star formation, but\nrather be a form of aftermath.\n\n11\n\n(e.g., Churchwell et al. 1984). We know, however, from\nother studies of IC 694 that the dense gas is warm\n(Tkin >\n\u223c 80K) (Aalto et al. 1998) and the compact CO nucleus of NGC 2623 likely harbours an ISM similar to that\nof IC 694. The starburst may have evolved beyond a strong\nradiative impact from the stars while the chemisty is still\ndominated by ion-neutral reactions at moderate gas density and relatively high electron abundance.\n\n4.3.2. PDRs\nFor those galaxies where I(CN) is >\n\u223c I(HCN) a significant\npart of the ISM should be in PDRs. In the Galaxy they\nare often found in interface regions between HII regions\nand molecular clouds (e.g., Jansen et al. 1995) and near\nplanetary nebulae. CN luminous galaxies are very clearly\nin the phase where the ISM is being strongly affected by\nan intense UV field. The filling factor of UV illuminated\ngas must be high, and the clouds probably not too large\n[CN]\nsince the [HCN]\nabundance ratio drops dramatically with\nincreasing AV . The mechanical impact of the starburst\n(superwinds - supernovae) may help in fragmenting the\nmolecular clouds. Emission from complex molecules, such\nas HC3 N, is faint because of photodestruction. Since the\nchemistry now, to a large degree, involves ion-neutral reactions (see Sect. 4.1) the HNC abundance becomes less\ndependent on temperature and I(HNC) may be significant even from a warm PDR. For example, the temperature around a planetary nebula may become very high\n(\u2248 100 K) but the HNC abundance is substantial enough\nHCN\nline intensity ratios close to unity (e.g.,\nto result in HNC\nHerpin & Cernicharo 2000).\nFor Arp 220, it appears that HC3 N is mainly emerging\nfrom the eastern nucleus (see Sect 3.2.1) which would support the notion of an evolutionary difference between the\ntwo nuclei. Rodriguez-Franco et al. (1998) show that the\nemission from HC3 N is bright toward hot, dense cores,\nwhile the HC3 N/CN abundance ratio is only 10\u22123 in\nPDRs. Thus the eastern nucleus seems to be in an earlier\nevolutionary phase where star formation has just begun.\nIn the mid-IR the western nucleus is more prominent than\nthe eastern one (Soifer et al. 1999).\nAs discussed in Sect. 4.2.1. the absence of PDR tracers,\nsuch as CN emission and the 158 \u03bcm [C II] fine structure\nline, does not necessarily mean that the burst is young\n(or shock dominated). In high-pressure, dusty ULIRGs it\nis possible that the formation of PDRs is suppressed -\nor that the PDRs are associated with the diffuse lower\ndensity molecular material where the classic PDR lines\nwill not be excited.\n\n4.3.3. An evolved burst\nTwo galaxies (NGC 2623 and IC 694) show fairly bright\nHNC emission but with undetected CN emission. Very\ncold (10 K) and dense gas would result in I(HCN)=\n0.3 \u2212 0.5 \u00d7 I(HNC) and I(CN) < I(HCN). In the Galaxy\nsuch conditions dominate clouds like TMC-1 and TMC-2\n\n5. Summary\nWe have undertaken a SEST and OSO survey of CN and\nHNC line emission in a sample of 13 luminous IR galaxies, plus one more \"normal\" starburst (NGC 1808). This\nsurvey is the first in its kind for IR luminous galaxies. The\nmain conclusions we draw from this survey are as follows:\n1. We have detected HNC 1-0 in 9 of the galaxies,\nwhile CN 1-0 is detected in 10 galaxies. The CN 2-1\nlines (J=5/2-3/2, F =7/2-5/2; J=3/2-1/2 F=5/2-3/2)\n(which could only be measured at SEST) are detected\nin 7 galaxies - in one (NGC 34) the CN 1-0 line was\nnot detected, while the 2-1 line was.\n2. The line intensitites vary significantly from galaxy to\ngalaxy and the line ratios relative to the \"standard\"\nhigh density tracer, HCN, are far from constant. The\nHCN\nHCN\n>\nHNC ratios vary from 1 to \u223c 6 and the CN ratios range\n>\nfrom 0.5 to \u223c 6. From this we can learn that the actual properties of the dense gas vary significantly from\ngalaxy to galaxy, even if their HCN luminosities are\nsimilar.\n3. We report the detection of HC3 N 10-9 emission in\nArp 220 at 40% of the HNC 1-0 intensity. In NGC 1808\nthe line is tentatively detected.\n4. We find that the IR luminous galaxies are at least as\nHNC luminous as more nearby (IR-fainter) galaxies.\nWe conclude that the HNC emission is not a reliable\ntracer of cold (10 K) gas in the center of luminous\nIR galaxies, the way it may be in clouds in the disk\nof the Milky Way. Instead, we list several alternative\n(testable) explanations. Provided that the situation in\nthe centers of starburst galaxies can be approximated\nwith a steady state chemistry, the observed HCN\nHNC line\nratios can be explained by the emission originating in\n5\ngas of densities n <\ncm\u22123 where the chemistry is\n\u223c 10\ndominated by ion-neutral, instead of neutral-neutral,\nreactions. The temperature dependence of the HNC\nproduction in the ion-neutral reactions is strongly suppressed.\n5. We were surprised to find that the CN emission of the\nmore luminous galaxies is often faint. This can be consistent with the relative faintness of other PDR tracers\nsuch as the 158 \u03bcm [C II] line. Both these phenomena can be understood in terms of a two-component\nmolecular ISM consisting of low density molecular gas\nsurrounding dense clouds. However, the relative brightness of CN in Arp 220 may be difficult to reconcile with\nits relative [C II] faintness.\n\n\f12\n\nS. Aalto, A. G. Polatidis, S. H\u00fcttemeister, S. J. Curran: CN,HNC in Galaxies\n\n6. Within Arp 299 (the merging pair IC 694 and\nNGC3690) there is a line ratio difference between the\ntwo nuclei. NGC 3690 has a CN luminosity twice that\nof HCN and its ISM is thus strongly affected by UV\nradiation while CN is not detected towards IC 694.\nThis reflects an evolutionary gradient in the burst -\nor that the star formation activity takes place in very\ndifferent environments in the two galaxies. For Arp 220\nthere may also be an evolutionary gradient between the\ntwo nuclei because of differences in emission velocities\nfor CN and HC3 N.\n7. The measured line ratios can in general be used to\nidentify stages in the starburst evolution, but we conclude that the dichotomy between scenarios is a complication. For example, faint HNC emission is expected\nboth in a shock dominated ISM as well as for a cloud\nensemble dominated by dense warm gas in the very\nearly stages of a starburst.\nAcknowledgements.
