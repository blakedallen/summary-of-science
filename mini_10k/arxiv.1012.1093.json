This model is one the one hand highly restricted\nby near three generation unitarity as well as electroweak precision tests [1, 2, 3] and\n\u2206F = 2 observables [4, 9, 10]. On the other hand still leaves room for sometimes\nhuge effects in soon to be measured observables. The generalisation of the CKM\nmatrix to four generations yields five new parameters \u03b814 , \u03b824 , \u03b834 , \u03b414 , \u03b424 . Together\nwith the two new quark masses this gives a total of 7 new parameters in the quark\nsector. In the lepton sector the new mixing angles are highly restricted through an\ninterplay of bounds from rare \u03bc and \u03c4 decays and their measured lifetimes [13, 12].\nThe recent efforts in studying flavour physics in the presence of a fourth generation [4,\n5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] show clearly that in spite of its few new parameters the SM4\ncan not be excluded yet. In figure 1 we show on the left panel the correlation of\n\nFigure 1: s24 vs s14 (left panel) and mt0 as a function of s34 (right panel) both show\nhow constrained the new parameters are.\ns14 and s24 , this strong correlation is due to the directly measured CKM elements,\nKaon physics and electroweak precision measurements [1, 10]. On the right panel of\nfigure 1 we show mt0 as a function of s34 this correlation can be directly linked to\nthe constraint coming from the T parameter [1, 2, 3]. For the global analysis we use\nthe convenient colour-coding specified below and in table table 1. The large black\npoint represents the SM3. Light blue and dark blue points stand for the results of\nour global analysis of the SM4 with the following distinction: light blue stands for\nBr(KL \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd) > 2 * 10\u221210 and dark blue for Br(KL \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd) \u2264 2 * 10\u221210 .\n\n2\n\nRare Decays and CP violation\n\nWith the data collected till the end of 2011, the LHC experiments will be able to\nexclude Br(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) down to nearly the SM3 value. This of course prompts\n1\n\n\fBS1 (yellow)\nS\u03c8\u03c6\n0.04 \u00b1 0.01\n+ \u2212\nBr(Bs \u2192 \u03bc \u03bc ) (2 \u00b1 0.2) * 10\u22129\n\nBS2 (green)\n0.04 \u00b1 0.01\n(3.2 \u00b1 0.2) * 10\u22129\n\nBS3 (red)\n\u2265 0.4\n\u2265 6 * 10\u22129\n\nTable 1: Three scenarios for S\u03c8\u03c6 and Br(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ).\n\nfor the analysis of this decay in the context of models beyond the SM3. In figure\n2 we show Br(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) in correlation with Br(Bd \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) and S\u03c8\u03c6 . There\nare two interesting features. On the left panel we find a anti-correlation between\n\nFigure 2: Br(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) in correlation with Br(Bd \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) (left panel) and S\u03c8\u03c6\n(right panel).\nBr(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) and Br(Bd \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ), which allows for any of the both branching\nratios to be above or below the SM3 expectation but not simultaneously. On the right\npanel we find a strong dependence of Br(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) on S\u03c8\u03c6 in the case of a big S\u03c8\u03c6 .\nAdditionally we note that for a suppressed Br(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) we expect S\u03c8\u03c6 to be SM3\nlike. Another upcoming experiment (NA62) intends to measure Br(K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd) to\nan accuracy of roughly 10%. In figure 3 we show Br(KL \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd) as a function of\nBr(K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd). Br(KL \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd) can be enhanced by orders of magnitude above\nthe SM3 expectation which implies an automatic enhancement of Br(K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd).\nHowever the reverse is not true, Br(K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd) can be enhanced while Br(KL \u2192\n\u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd) stays at its SM3 value or even below. The cut in Br(K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd) on the lower\naxis is due to Br(KL \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 )SD .\n\n2.1\n\nThe importance of \u03b50 /\u03b5\n\nThe ratio of direct over indirect CP violation the neutral Kaon decays is well measured\nbut theoretical predictions suffer from hadronic uncertainties parametrised by R6 and\nR8 . To address the issue of the two unknown parameters we chose four different\nscenarios for (R6 , R8 ) and studied the effect \u03b50 /\u03b5 could have as a constraint on the\n2\n\n\fFigure 3: Br(KL \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd) as a function of Br(K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd). The dotted line\ncorresponds to the model-independent GN bound.\nSM4.\n\nIn figure 4 we show the impact of \u03b50 /\u03b5 as a constraint on the correlations\n\nFigure 4: The correlation Br(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) vs. S\u03c8\u03c6 (left panel) Br(KL \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd)\nas a function of Br(K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd) (right panel) after including the \u03b50 /\u03b5-constraint\n(colour-coding according to Tab. 2).\nBr(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) vs. S\u03c8\u03c6 and Br(KL \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd) vs. Br(K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd) for the four\ndifferent scenarios for the unknown hadronic parameters R6 and R8 . Note that for all\nscenarios the allowed range for 0 < S\u03c8\u03c6 is severely constrained. This behaviour can be\neasily understood; for S\u03c8\u03c6 > 0 the contributions from the Z 0 penguins with t and t0\nhave the same sign and overcompensate the contributions of the QCD penguins . The\nsolution to this problem is to reduce the effect of the Z 0 penguins while increasing\nthe importance of the QCD penguins, e.g. the 'orange' scenario.\n\n3\n\nLepton Flavour Violation\n\nThe mixing between the fourth and the first three lepton generations is stringently\nconstrained through an interplay of radiative \u03bc and \u03c4 decays and their respective\n3\n\n\fR6 R8\n1.0 1.0 dark blue\n2.0 1.0\ngreen\n\nR6\n1.5\n1.5\n\nR8\n0.8\n0.5\n\npurple\norange\n\nTable 2: Four scenarios for the parameters R6 and R8\n\ntree-level decays [13, 12]. New experiments for the search of the decay \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 and\n\u03bc \u2212 e conversion in nuclei are in the progress of being build or in a planning stage.\nOn the left panel of figure 5 we show how these future measurements will constrain\nthe correlation of \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 an \u03bc \u2212 e conversion in nuclei. Note that the correlation is\n\nFigure 5: Correlation between Br(\u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3) and R(\u03bcTi \u2192 eTi) (left panel). Correlation between Br(\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3) and Br(\u03c4 \u2192 e\u03b3) (right panel). The shaded areas indicate\nthe expected future experimental bounds on both observables.\nrather diffuse, this is due to the fact that for \u03bc \u2212 e conversion several contributions\ncan cancel each other [12]. On the right panel of figure 5 we show the correlation\nbetween Br(\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3) and Br(\u03c4 \u2192 e\u03b3) together with projected exclusion limits from\nSuperBelle. The shape of the correlation is due to the |U\u03c4\u22174 Ue4 | dependence for \u03c4 \u2192 e\u03b3\nand the |U\u03c4\u22174 U\u03bc4 | dependence for \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3. Taking into account that \u03bc \u2212 e conversion\n\u2217\nconstrains |U\u03bc4\nUe4 | it is clear that Br(\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3) and Br(\u03c4 \u2192 e\u03b3) can not be at their\nmaximum simultaneously.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\u2022 The branching ratio Br(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) can be enhanced or suppressed in the\nSM4. However if S\u03c8\u03c6 \u001d 0 as suggested by the Tevatron data was indeed true\nwe would expect an enhancement of Br(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ).\n\n4\n\n\f\u2022 In the K system there is independently of the B system much room for in some\ncases huge effects, however they are correlated among each other.\n\u2022 \u03b50 /\u03b5 can pose a very stringent constraint on the SM4 if the non-pert. parameters\nB6 and B8 were known to a decent accuracy.\n\u2022 The new mixing angles in the lepton sector are tightly constrained through\nupper bounds on rare decays and tree level decays of \u03bc and \u03c4 . Still big enhancements of rare decays are possible though not always simultaneously.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nI want to thank Andrzej J.
