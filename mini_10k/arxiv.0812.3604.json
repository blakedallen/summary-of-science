The standard strategy to design an EDF\nfor nuclei is to start with a single-reference EDF (SREDF) where an effective interaction (Skyrme or Gogny\ntype) and a trial state (Slater Determinant or more generally quasi-particle vacuum) are chosen. This technique is able to describe short-range correlations like\npairing and provides already a rather good description\nof observables such as masses, under the condition that\nsome symmetries of the original Hamiltonian are broken. The SR-EDF is then extended to restore broken\nsymmetries and/or incorporate long-range correlations\nthrough configuration mixing, leading to the so-called\nMulti-Reference EDF (MR-EDF)[3]. Recent applications\nof this technique have revealed important conceptual and\npractical difficulties [4] related to the absence of a constructive framework for multi-reference calculations. A\nsolution to this problem, has been recently proposed [5]\nand successfully tested in nuclei [6]. However, this cure\ndoes not apply to most of the functionals currently used\n[7], i.e. those with fractional powers of density.\nThis motivates the search of new techniques to extend\nactual SR-EDF. The Density Matrix Functional Theory\n(DMFT) [8] appear as an alternative to configuration\nmixing [9]. Although this theory was proposed more than\n30 years ago [8], explicit forms of functionals and applications have only been explored rather recently. There\nare nowadays an increasing interest in proposing accurate\nDMFT [10]. In this work, DMFT is applied to the twolevel Lipkin model [11]. In this model, the Hartree-Fock\n(HF) theory fails to reproduce the ground state energy\n[12] while configuration mixing like Generator Coordinate Method (GCM) provides a suitable tool [3]. Therefore, the two-level Lipkin model is perfectly suited both\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: lacroix@ganil.fr\n\nto illustrate that DMFT could be a valuable tool and\nto provide an example of functional for system with a\n\"shape\" phase-transition.\nIn this following, some aspects of DMFT are first recalled. Then a semi-empirical functional is constructed\nfor the Lipkin model and applied for various particle\nnumber and two-body interaction strengths. It is shown\nto improve significantly the HF theory. Finally, the interest of constructing more general functional of natural\norbitals and occupation numbers in the EDF context is\noutlined.\n\nII.\n\nDISCUSSION ON DMFT\n\nThe concept of Density Matrix Functional Theory is a\ngeneralization of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem [13] due\nto Gilbert [8]. It relies on a theorem showing that the\nground state energy could be written as a functional of\nthe one-body density matrix (OBDM) \u03b3(r, r\u2032 ) (instead of\nthe local one-particle density \u03c1(r) \u2261 \u03b3(r, r) in the standard Hohenberg-Kohn theorem). Then, similarly to the\nKohn-Sham orbitals [14], the eigenvalues ni and eigenvectors \u03c6i , called hereafter resp. occupation numbers\nand natural orbitals, of the OBDM P\nare often used instead of \u03b3(r, r\u2032 ) with the relation \u03b3 = i |\u03c6i ini h\u03c6i |. The\nvariation of the functional\nF [{\u03c6i }, {ni }] = E[{\u03c6i }, {ni }]\n\n\u2212 \u03bc{T r(\u03c1) \u2212 N } \u2212\n\nX\nij\n\n\u03bbij (h\u03c6i |\u03c6j i \u2212 \u03b4ij\n(1)\n),\n\nwith respect to one-particle state components \u03c6\u2217i (r) and\noccupation numbers (with the additional constraint 0 <\nni < 1) is then performed to obtained the optimal \u03c6i ,\nni and associated ground state energy. The set of Lagrange multipliers \u03bc and {\u03bbij } are introduced to insure\nparticle number conservation and orthogonality of the\nsingle-particle states. In Eq. (1), E[{\u03c6i }, {ni }] is nothing\nbut the functional itself which has to be found. In electronic system, the functional is generally separated into\nthe Hartree, denoted by EH , (eventually Hartree-Fock,\n\n\f2\nEHF ) part and the exchange-correlation part, denoted\nhere by EXC (eventually correlation only EC ).\nWhile the DMFT has been studied theoretically for a\nrather long time [8, 15, 16, 17, 18], only recently explicit\nfunctionals of the OBDM or directly to natural orbitals\nhave been proposed and applied to realistic situations[10,\n19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]. There are\nnowadays extensive works to test functionals especially in\ninfinite systems, the so-called Homogeneous Electronic\nGas (HEG) [32, 33].\nIII.\n\nAPPLICATION OF THE DMFT TO THE\nLIPKIN MODEL\n\nThe \"Lipkin Model\" [11] is an exactly solvable model\nthat has often been used as a benchmark for approximations for the nuclear many-body problem [3]. In this\nmodel, one considers N particles distributed in two Nfold degenerated shells separated by an energy \u03b5. The\nassociated Hamiltonian is given by:\nH = \u03b5J0 \u2212\n\nV\n(J+ J+ + J\u2212 J\u2212 ),\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere V denotes the interaction strength while J0 , J\u00b1\nare the quasi-spin operators defined as\nN\n\nJ0 =\n\nJ+ =\n\nc\u2020+,p c\u2212,p ,\n\n\u2020\nJ \u2212 = J+\n,\n\np=1\n\nc\u2020+,p and c\u2020\u2212,p are creation operators associated with the\nupper and lower level. The exact solution of this model,\nis easily obtained by noting that J 2 (but not J0 ) commute\nwith H. It is then convenient to introduce the basis of\neigenstates of J 2 and J0 and diagonalize the Hamiltonian\nin this particular space (for more detail see for instance\n[34]).\nA.\n\nHartree-Fock approximation\n\nIn the Hartree-Fock (or Mean-Field) theory, the manybody wave function is replaced by a Slater Determi\u2020\nnant (SD) given by |\u03a6i = \u03a0N\np=1 a0,p |\u2212i. Here, a new\nsingle-particle basis, denoted by {\u03c60,p , \u03c61,p } associated\nto the set of creation/annihilation operators {a\u20200,p , a\u20201,p }\nhas been introduced through the relation\n!\n!\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u2217\na\u20201,p\nc\u2020+,p\nf \u2212g \u2217\n,\n(3)\n=\ng f\nc\u2020\u2212,p\na\u20200,p\nwhere the choice\nf = cos(\u03b1),\n\ng = sin(\u03b1)ei\u03c6 ,\n\nEMF (\u03b1, \u03c6) \u2261 h\u03a6(\u03b1, \u03c6)|H|\u03a6(\u03b1, \u03c6)i\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\nAnticipating for the forthcoming discussion, we first write\nEMF as a functional of the OBDM \u03b3:\nEMF [\u03b3] = \u03b5Tr(J0 \u03b3)\no\nV (N \u2212 1) n\n\u2212\n(Tr[\u03b3J+ ])2 + (Tr[\u03b3J\u2212 ])2 . (6)\n2N\n\nIn the Hartree-Fock limit, the OBDM contains all the\ninformation on the many-body state and simply reads\nPN\n\u03b3 = p=1 |\u03c60,p ih\u03c60,p |. Reporting the expression of |\u03c60,p i\nin terms of \u03b1 and \u03c6, we recover the standard HF expression:\no\n\u03b5N n\n\u03c7\nEMF [\u03b1, \u03c6] = \u2212\ncos(2\u03b1) + sin2 (2\u03b1) cos(2\u03c6) (7)\n.\n2\n2\n\nwhere \u03c7 = V (N \u22121)/\u03b5. Minimizing with respect to (\u03b1, \u03c6)\n0\nleads to HF energy, denoted by EHF\n(both with \u03c6 = 0):\n\u03b5N\nfor \u03c7 \u2264 1 (at \u03b1 = 0),\n2\n\u0001\n\u03b5N\n= \u2212\n1 + \u03c72 for \u03c7 > 1 (at \u03c7 cos(2\u03b1) = 1).\n4\u03c7\n\n0\nEHF\n= \u2212\n0\nEHF\n\n\u0011\n1 X\u0010 \u2020\nc+,p c+,p \u2212 c\u2020\u2212,p c\u2212,p ,\n2 p=1\n\nN\nX\n\nautomatically insures the orthogonality of the new states.\nDue to simple structure of the Lipkin model, the variation\nwith respect to the SD state is identical to the variation\nof the \u03b1 and \u03c6, i.e. |\u03a6i = |\u03a6(\u03b1, \u03c6)i and the HF energy\nbecomes a functional of these parameters:\n\nThe HF solution for the Lipkin model has been extensively discussed in the literature [3, 12]. While it provides\na rather good estimate of the exact energy in the weak\ncoupling or in the large N limit, it generally differs rather\nsignificantly from it in particular for \u03c7 \u223c 1. This discrepancy essentially reflects the failure of the HF method\nto account for configuration mixing in a single-reference\nframework for systems with a shape phase-transition [3].\nB.\n\nExpression of the Hamiltonian for a General\ncorrelated state\n\nDue to the two-body nature of the Hamiltonian (Eq.\n(2)), the most natural way to extend the Mean-Field\nframework to correlated system is to introduce the twobody density matrix, denoted by \u039312 and the associated\ncorrelation matrix \u03c312 (see for instance [35]). Using the\nOBDM of the correlated system \u03b3, \u03c312 is defined through\nthe relation:\n\u039312 = \u03b31 \u03b32 (1 \u2212 P12 ) + \u03c312 ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere P12 denotes the anti-symmetrization operator\nwhile the label \"i\" in \u03b3i refers to the particle on which\nthe density is applied, i.e. hij|\u03b31 \u03b32 |kli = hi|\u03b3|kihj|\u03b3|li\n[36]. The expectation value of the energy then splits into\na mean-field part and a correlated part as :\nE = EMF [\u03b3] + EC [\u03c312 ],\n\n(9)\n\n\f3\nwhere EMF [\u03b3] is given by expression (6) except that \u03b3\nnow refers to the OBDM of the correlated system. EC\nreads:\nV\nTr {[J+ J+ + J\u2212 J\u2212 ]12 \u03c312 }\n2\nX\n= \u2212V\nR (h+, p; +, p\u2032 |\u03c312 |\u2212, p; \u2212, p\u2032i)(10)\n,\n\nEC [\u03c312 ] = \u2212\n\np,p\u2032\n\nwhere the notation [.]12 emphasizes that the trace is performed using the two-body matrix elements of the operators.\nEq. (9) is valid for any correlated system including the\nexact ground state. The minimization of it with respect\nto any kind of OBDM and correlations will therefore lead\nto the ground state energy. Such a direct minimization is\ncomplex due to the number of degrees of freedom involved\nin the variation [35].\nDMFT provides a practical solution to this problem.\nIndeed, according to this theory [8], the total energy\ncould be written as a functional of \u03b3. Since EMF [\u03b3] is\nalready written as a functional of the OBDM, we are left\nto find a functional for EC . In many cases, both EMF\nand EC are directly written as a functional of the natural\norbitals \u03c6i and occupation numbers ni , i.e.\nE[{\u03c6i , ni }] = EMF [{\u03c6i , ni }] + EC [{\u03c6i , ni }].\n\n(11)\n\nDMFT has some additional advantages compared to\nstandard DFT. Besides the fact that the exchange contribution could be expressed exactly with the OBDM,\nat the minimum the optimal OBDM identifies with the\nground state OBDM. Therefore, expectation values of\nany one-body observable could be computed and should\ncorrespond to the ground state expectation value. Accordingly, if the mean-field prescription is used in EMF\nfor a given H, the value of EMF at the minimum will\n\ntruly correspond to the true mean-field contribution to\nthe total energy. Consequently, EC will truly correspond\nto the contribution of correlation (this issue will further\nbe discussed in section III E).\nRecently, significant efforts have been made in the\npractical construction of such density matrix functionals\n[10, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]. In\nmost cases, guided by general considerations [18] and/or\nconstraints on the two-body density [20], \u03c312 is first written as a functional of the natural orbitals and occupation\nnumbers. This corresponds generally to a starting point\nfor more elaborated functionals. Functionals are further\nenriched by incorporating additional terms either to correct for the self-interaction problem or eventually to better reproduce some specific limits in the infinite HEG or\nconfiguration interaction calculation in molecules (for a\nrecent review see [37]).\nC.\n\nConstruction of a density matrix functional for\nCorrelated state\n\nDue to the specific form of the Lipkin Hamiltonian\ngiven by Eq. (2), \u03b3 simply writes in the natural basis as:\n\n\u03b3=\n\nN n\no\nX\n|\u03c60,p in0 h\u03c60,p | + |\u03c61,p in1 h\u03c61,p | ,\n\nwith n1 = (1 \u2212 n0 ). The single-particle states |\u03c6i,p i (with\ni = 0, 1) now stand for the natural orbitals while the ni\ncorrespond to occupation numbers. Similarly to the HF\ntheory, creation operators, denoted by a\u2020i,p , associated to\nnatural orbitals are expressed from the c\u2020\u00b1,p using Eq.\n(3). The mean-field contribution is easily deduced from\nthe HF case, using Eq. (6) and the expression of \u03b3 given\nabove, leads to:\n\nEMF ({\u03c6i,p , ni }) = EMF (\u03b1, \u03c6, n0 )\no\n\u03c7\n\u03b5 n\n= \u2212 N cos(2\u03b1)(2n0 \u2212 1) + sin2 (2\u03b1) cos(2\u03c6)(2n0 \u2212 1)2 .\n2\n2\nExpressing EC is less straightforward. A possible strategy to construct functionals is to identify specific limits\nat which explicit forms are known. For instance the two\nelectron case which has been studied in [38] has largely\ninfluence presently used DMFT for molecules [37]. Following this idea, the N = 2 case is first considered.\n\n1.\n\nThe N = 2 case\n\nTo study the N = 2 case, a basis of Slater Determinant\nis constructed using the natural orbitals, i.e. |\u03a6ij i =\n\n(12)\n\np=1\n\n(13)\n\na\u2020i,p a\u2020j,p\u2032 |\u2212i with i and j either 0 or 1. The ground state\nwave-function \u03a8 then reads:\nX\nCij |\u03a6ij i.\n(14)\n|\u03a8i =\nij\n\nFrom the expression of the OBDM and using the fact,\nthat the single-particle states are natural orbitals we obtain the simple relation |Cij |2 = \u03b4ij ni . From which we\n\u221a\ndeduce Cij = \u03b4ij ei\u03b8ii ni . As illustrated below, the simplest choice ei\u03b8ii = 1 is convenient and leads to\n\u221a\n\u221a\n|\u03a8i = n0 |\u03a600 i + n1 |\u03a611 i,\n(15)\n\n\f4\nwhich is nothing but the exact ground state wavefunction written as a functional of occupation numbers\nand natural states. Reporting this expression in h\u03a6|H|\u03a6i,\n\nE\n\nN =2\n\n(\u03b1, \u03c6, n0 ) = \u2212\u03b5 cos(2\u03b1)(2n0 \u2212 1) \u2212 V\n\nn1\n2\n\nleads to a total ground state energy E\n\nN =2\n\ngiven by:\n\no\n\u0001p\nn0 (1 \u2212 n0 ) .(16)\nsin2 (2\u03b1) cos(2\u03c6) + 2 sin4 (\u03b1) cos(4\u03c6) + cos4 (\u03b1)\n\nUsing the expression of the mean-field contribution (Eq. (13)), we deduce\nn\no\n\u0001p\nN =2\nEC (\u03b1, \u03c6, n0 ) = \u22122V sin2 (2\u03b1) cos(2\u03c6)n0 (1 \u2212 n0 ) + sin4 (\u03b1) cos(4\u03c6) + cos4 (\u03b1)\nn0 (1 \u2212 n0 ) .\n\ntional in terms of natural orbitals and occupation numbers is known. This limit is used here as a guide to\nprovide a DMFT for N \u2265 3. The most simple extension\nof the functional derived for N = 2, consists in assuming\nthat the interaction of the N particle could be written\nas a sum of the interaction of the N (N \u2212 1)/2 pairs of\nparticles, each pair contributing to the total energy as in\nthe N = 2 case. This prescription naturally leads to the\nmean-field Hamiltonian given (13) and amount to take\nfor all N\n\n-1\n-1.2\n-1.4\n-1.6\n-1.8\n\n(17)\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nN (N \u2212 1) N =2\nEC (\u03b1, \u03c6, n0 ).\n(19)\n2\nThe minimal total energy obtained by varying both occupation numbers and \u03b1 (using \u03c6 = 0) using this prescription is displayed in Fig 2 (solid circles) as a function of \u03c7 for various particle numbers. In each case, the\nexact solution (solid line) and the Hartree-Fock prescription (dashed line) are shown. The simple scheme using\n(19) clearly provides a very poor approximation for the\nground state energy and always leads to an energy much\nbelow the exact one. In addition, the discrepancy increases as N increases. This failure points out the complex many-body correlations present in the Lipkin model\ncoming from the mixing of 1 particle-1 hole (1p-1h), 2p2h, np-nh excitations in the component in the ground\nstate. This leads to a much more complex situation than\nthe N = 2 case (Eq. (15)). In particular, using the contracted Schr\u00f6dinger equation (CSE), we do expect that\nthe two-body correlation depends on higher order correlation matrices [22]. The correlation energy given by (19)\nclearly neglects these higher-order effects.\nFrom Fig. 2, we see that the correlation energy is\nlargely overestimated. In the following, we use a slightly\ndifferent prescription for the correlation energy given by:\nEC (\u03b1, \u03c6, n0 ) =\n\nFIG. 1: Comparison between the exact energy (solid line),\nHartree-Fock (dashed line) and the energy obtained from the\nminimization of Eq. (16) (filled circles) as a function of \u03c7 for\nthe N = 2 case.\n\nSince the above functional is exact, the ground state energy should be recovered by minimization with respect to\nn0 , \u03b1 and \u03c6. As in the HF case, \u03c6 = 0 could always be\ntaken. The variation of n0 should be made under the constraint n0 \u2208 [0, 1]. A similar technique as in the HF+BCS\ncase could be employed [3]. Writing n0 = cos2 (\u03b8) with\n\u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0/2], gives at the minimum\n\u0012 4\n\u0013\nsin (\u03b1) cos(4\u03c6) + cos4 (\u03b1)\ntan(2\u03b8) = \u03c7\n.\n(18)\ncos(2\u03b1)\nThen, variation of the \u03b1 is made to obtain the minimum\nenergy. The result (filled circles) is displayed in Fig. 1\nand compared\nto the exact ground state energy given by\np\nE = \u2212 1 + \u03c72 [11] (solid line) and the Hartree-Fock energy (dashed line). Not surprisingly, while the HF curve\ndeviates significantly from the solid line, the DMFT could\nnot be distinguished from the exact case.\n2.\n\nDMFT for N \u2265 3 and large N scaling\n\nThe Lipkin model with N = 2 is an interesting pedagogical example of DMFT where the exact energy func-\n\nN \u22653\n\nEC\n\n(\u03b1, \u03c6, n0 ) = \u03b7(N )\n\nN (N \u2212 1) N =2\nEC (\u03b1, \u03c6, n0 ), (20)\n2\n\nwhere \u03b7(N ) is a reduction factor introduced to mimic the\neffect of higher order correlations. The optimal value of\n\u03b7 this is determined empirically from the following procedure. For a given value of N and \u03b7, the mimimum enN\nergy of the corresponding DMFT, denoted by Emin\n(\u03b7, \u03c7)\n\n\f5\n\n1\n\n-2.5\n\n0.8\n0.6\n\n-5\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n-7.5\n\n-10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nFIG. 3: Values of the optimal quenching factor \u03b7(N ) as a\nfunction of the particle number N.

Since this correlation energy is proportional to\nhJx2 i, we observe that the N \u22122/3 deduced empirically is\nnothing but the large N scaling behavior obtained analytically in ref. [39], i.e. hJx2 i/N 2 \u221d N \u22122/3 .\n\n3\n\nFIG. 2: Exact ground state energy (solid lines) displayed as\na function of \u03c7 for N = 5 to 20 resp. from top to bottom.\nIn each case, the corresponding HF (dashed line) and DMFT\n(filled circles) are shown. The latter are obtained by minimization of the functional using the mean-field and correlation energy resp. given by Eq. (13) and Eq. (19).\n\nis computed for \u03c7 between 0 and \u03c7max = 3. Then, the\nquantity DN (\u03b7), given by\nZ \u03c7max\n\b N\n2\nN\nN\nEGS (\u03c7) \u2212 Emin\n(\u03b7, \u03c7) d\u03c7, (21)\nD (\u03b7) =\n0\n\nN\nEGS\n(\u03c7)\n\nwhere\ndenotes the exact ground state energy\nfor a given N and \u03c7, is computed. Obviously, DN (\u03b7)\ngives a measure of the deviation between the DFMT\nminimum energy and the exact energy over the interval \u03c7 \u2208 [0, \u03c7max ]. The optimal value of \u03b7(N ) is defined\nas the minimum of DN (\u03b7) as \u03b7 varies between 0 (the HF\nlimit) and 1 (the prescription of Eq. (19)). Values of\noptimal reduction factors are reported by filled circles in\nFig. 3 as a function of N . As guessed from the increasing\ndiscrepancy observed with increasing N observed in Fig.\n2, the higher is N the smaller should \u03b7 be taken. The\nvariation of \u03b7(N ) turns out to simply behave as N \u22122/3 .\nThe solid line in Fig (3) represents the function\n\u03b7(N ) = c N \u22122/3 ,\n\n(22)\n\nwith c = 1.5 deduced by fitting optimal values of \u03b7. In\nthe following, we show that the semi-empirical density\nmatrix functional theory constructed from the mean-field\nand correlation energy resp. given by Eq. (13) and Eq.\n(20) significantly improves the HF theory.\nCombining expression (22) with Eq. (20) shows that\nthe correlation energy scales as EC \u221d N 4/3 as N in-\n\nD.\n\nResults of the semi-empirical DMFT\n\nThe minimal energy deduced from the semi-empirical\ndensity matrix functional proposed above (filled circles)\nis systematically compared to the exact ground state energy (solid line) and HF energy (dashed line) for different particle number and two-body interaction strength\nin Fig. 4 and 5. In all cases, the DMFT significantly improves the HF result and turns out to be very close to the\nexact one. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the HF energy generally deviates rather significantly from the exact energy\naround \u03c7 = 1 and does not provides the correct asymptotic behavior as \u03c7 increases. This deviation, which disappears as N \u2192 \u221e, is due to the failure of HF theory\nin the presence of a \"shape\" phase transition [12] between the spherical solution (\u03c7 < 1) and the \"deformed\"\nsolution (\u03c7 > 1). The standard technique to properly\naccount for this effect is to mix different slater determinants like in the GCM theory. We see in figure 4 and 5\nthat, except a small deviation around \u03c7 = 1 which seems\nto slightly increase as N increases, both the asymptotic\nbehavior at large \u03c7 and N and the energy around \u03c7 = 1\nare rather well reproduced. It is worth mentioning that\nthe DMFT is much less demanding in terms of computational power than the GCM and thus provides a rather\ninteresting alternative to the latter theory.\n\nE.\n\nDiscussion on Density Matrix Functional\nTheory with broken symmetry\n\nSimilarly to the Hartree-Fock case, the one-body density solution of the functional developed here can eventually violate some symmetries of the \"true\" ground state\n\n\f6\n\n-0.4\n\n-2.5\n\n-5\n\n-0.6\n\n-7.5\n-0.8\n-10\n-1\n-12.5\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nFIG. 4: Exact ground state energy (solid lines) displayed as\na function of \u03c7 for N = 5 to 20 resp. from top to bottom.\nIn each case, the corresponding HF (dashed line) and DMFT\n(filled circle) minimum energy are shown. The DMFT calculation is performed using the mean-field and correlation energy\nresp. given by Eq. (13) and Eq. (20) with \u03b7(N ) = 1.5 N \u22122/3 .\n\ndensity. The invariance of the Hamiltonian (2) with respect to parity imposes hJ+ i = hJ\u2212 i = 0. This implies\nthat at the minimum of the functional \u03b1 = 0. This is indeed the case for the exact functional given by Eq. (16)\nfor N = 2. However, solutions with \u03b1 6= 0 are found\nfor larger particle number. This is illustrated in figure 6\nwhere the value of \u2206+\u2212 \u2261 (hJ+ i + hJ\u2212 i)/2N is displayed\nas a function of \u03c7. The value of \u03c7, for which \u03b1 becomes\nnon-zero, denoted by \u03c7c is infinite for N = 2, around 1.6\nfor N = 5 and tends to the HF case (\u03c7c = 1) as N goes to\ninfinity. Note that, in this limit, the HF functional alone\nalready provides a very good functional for the Lipkin\nmodel.\nAccording to DMFT, the OBDM \u03b3 obtained by minimizing the exact functional should match the exact\nOBDM at the minimum. Therefore, strictly speaking,\nthe extracted one-body density and associated natural\nstates and occupation numbers could not be the exact\nOBDM when some of the symmetries of the system are\nbroken. This has to be kept in mind when discussing\nexpectation values of one-body observables. As an illustration, the expectation value of the single-particle part\nof the Hamiltonian EJ0 \u2261 \u03b5T r(\u03b3J0 ) obtained using the\nOBDM minimizing the DMFT is displayed in Fig. 7 as a\nfunction of \u03c7 for different particle number (filled circles).\nThe exact (solid line) and HF (open circles) prescription\nare also shown.

It generally gives\nan almost perfect result when \u03b1 = 0 at the minimum, i.e.\nwhen the parity symmetry is respected by the OBDM.\nThe behavior of EJ0 is also rather satisfactory at large N\nand \u03c7. In other cases, small particle number and large \u03c7\nor large particle number and intermediate \u03c7 (1 \u2264 \u03c7 \u2264 2).\nFig. 7 illustrates that, when the functional respects all\nsymmetries of the original Hamiltonian, expectation values of one-body observables perfectly match the exact\nresults. This is the case of the semi-empirical functional\nproposed here for all particle number and \u03c7 \u2264 1. Of\ncourse it would be desirable to provide functionals that\nrespects the symmetries at the first place. However, as it\nis well known already at the HF level, the introduction\nof theories where symmetries are explicitly broken is a\nway to grasp some of the correlations which would have\nbeen very hard to incorporate without breaking the symmetries. The success of the DMFT functional at large N\nand \u03c7 can be attributed to the explicit parity symmetry\nbreaking as in the HF case.\n\n\f7\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n-2.5\n0\n0.5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n0\n0.5\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nFIG. 6: Expectation value of \u2206+\u2212 as a function of \u03c7 for N = 5\n(top), N = 10 (middle) and N = 20 (bottom).

Guided by the\nN = 2 case, a semi-empirical functional of the natural\nwave-functions and occupation numbers is constructed.\nThe minimization of the DMFT is shown to give a much\nbetter agreement of the exact ground state energy than\nthe HF scheme over a wide range of particle number and\ntwo-body interaction strength. The success of DMFT\nin the Lipkin model, shows that this theory could be a\nvaluable tool in many-body system in the presence of\n\"shape\" phase transition. Such transition often occurs\nfor instance in nuclear physics [1, 3] and is generally\ntreated by first introducing the Energy Density Functional of a single-reference vacuum (Slater Determinant\nor quasi-particle state) and then use GCM theory [1].\nDMFT could be a powerful tool to improve actual SREDF functionals, by writing directly the EDF in terms\nof natural orbitals and occupation numbers. The possibility to introduce occupation numbers has been promoted in Ref. [40] for the pairing Hamiltonian and in\n[41] for the three-level Lipkin model using a slightly different technique. However, the strategy based on DMFT\nseems quite natural to extend actual EDF. Indeed, following the strategy used here for the Lipkin model, we\ncan write the nuclear EDF as\nEEDF [{\u03c6i , ni }] = EMF [{\u03c6i , ni }] + EC [{\u03c6i , ni }]. (23)\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nFIG. 7: Expectation value of the one-body part of the Hamiltonian, denoted by EJ0 obtained at the minimum of the\nDMFT as a function of \u03c7 for N = 5 (top), N = 10 (middle) and N = 20 (bottom). The DMFT result (filled circles)\nis systematically compared with the exact (solid line) and HF\n(open circles) value. The value of the total energy minus EJ0 is\nalso shown in each panel for the DMFT (filled square), exact\n(dashed line) and HF (open square).\n\nThe most natural choice for the mean-field part is to use\nthe actual Skyrme functional which has been optimized\nfor decades. Note that, the nuclear problem differs from\nthe electronic case and/or the Lipkin model presented\nhere due to the fact that coefficients of the functional are\nnot directly linked to the bare interaction but adjusted\non experimental data. Therefore, the mean-field contribution already contains a large fraction of the correlation. Nevertheless, the above decomposition (Eq. (23))\nis already used in the nuclear context in SR-EDF calculations when a quasi-particle vacuum is retained for\nthe trial state. Then, the correlation energy identifies\nwith the pairing energy which could, in the canonical\nbasis, be written as a functional of occupation numbers\nand natural orbitals. Indeed, using the notation (i, \u012b)\nfor canonicals pairs of single-particle states, the pairing\nenergy writes\nq\n1 X \u03ba\u03ba p\nEC [{\u03c6i , ni }] \u2261\nv\u0304i\u012bj j\u0304 ni (1 \u2212 ni ) nj (1 \u2212 nj )\n4 i,j\n(24)\n\nwhere v\u0304 \u03ba\u03ba is the effective interaction in the pairing\nchannels and where we have replaced components of\nthe anomalous density \u03ba in the natural basis by \u03bai\u012b =\np\nni (1 \u2212 ni ). This functional is adapted for pairing like\n\n\f8\ncorrelations. However, the use of a reference state written as a product of quasi-particle states clearly restricts\nthe type of density matrix functional that can be guessed.\nThis class appears to be not general enough to account\nfor the diversity of phenomena occurring in nuclei. The\npossibility to use different functional than the BCS like\nones has already been discussed in the early time of the\nSkyrme EDF history [42]. The functional developed here\nfor the Lipkin model as well as functionals recently proposed in electronic systems [37], clearly point out the\npossibility to use alternative functionals which could be\nof interest for nuclear systems.\nA crucial aspect of the present work is the introduction of DMFT functionals that explicitly breaks some of\nthe symmetries of the original Hamiltonian to incorpo-\n\nrate complex correlations. It should be kept in mind that\nbroken symmetries imply that symmetries should a priori be restored. The problem of restoration of broken\nsymmetries in functional theories is an important aspect\nwhich deserves specific studies in the near future [5, 6, 7].\n\n[1] M. Bender, P.-H. Heenen, and P.-G.
