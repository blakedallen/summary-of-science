The q-deformed coherent states for a quantum particle on a circle are introduced\nand their properties investigated.\n\nPACS numbers: 02.20.Sv, 02.30.Gp, 02.40.-k, 03.65.-w, 03.65.Sq\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn spite of the fact that the first paper devoted to the quantum mechanics on a circle\nis most probably the article by Condon on the quantum pendulum, dated 1928 [1], the\ncoherent states for a quantum particle on a circle have been introduced only recently\n[2,3]. No wonder that there is also not any example of quantum deformations of these\nstates so far. We recall that the q-deformation of the standard coherent states was\nconstructed fifteen years ago in [4]. The need for such deformations is motivated,\namong others, by the importance of the non-deformed coherent states for the quantum\nmechanics on a circle, which have been already applied for example in quantum gravity\n[5]. In this work we introduce the q-generalization of the coherent states for a quantum\nparticle on a circle. We first recall the basic facts about the quantum mechanics on a\ncircle. Consider a free particle on a circle S 1 . According to [2], the best candidate to\nrepresent the position of a particle on the unit circle is the unitary operator U = ei\u03c6\u0302\n(\u03c6\u0302 hermitian) satisfying the following commutation rule with the hermitian angular\nmomentum operator J:\n[J, U] = U.\n\n(1.1)\n\nIn the Hilbert space L2 (S 1 ) of 2\u03c0-periodic functions, specified by the scalar product\nZ 2\u03c0\n1\nd\u03c6f \u2217(\u03c6)g(\u03c6),\n(1.2)\nhf |gi =\n2\u03c0 0\nthe operators U and J act as follows:\nUf (\u03c6) = ei\u03c6 f (\u03c6),\n\n(1.3)\n\n\f2\nand\nJf (\u03c6) = \u2212i\n\nd\nf (\u03c6).\nd\u03c6\n\n(1.4)\n\nConsider now the eigenvalue equation\nJ|ji = j|ji.\n\n(1.5)\n\nDemanding the time-reversal invariance of representations of (1.1) we have only two\npossibilities left: j integer and j half-integer [2]. In this work we restrict for simplicity\nto the case of integer j. Using (1.1) one finds that the operators U and U \u2020 are the ladder\noperators such that\nU|ji = |j + 1i,\n\u2020\n\nU |ji = |j \u2212 1i.\n\n(1.6a)\n(1.6b)\n\nProjecting (1.6b) on the eigenvector |\u03c6i of U satisfying\nU|\u03c6i = ei\u03c6 |\u03c6i\n\n(1.7)\n\nwe get\nej (\u03c6) := h\u03c6|ji = eij\u03c6 .\n\n(1.8)\n\nOf course, the vectors ej (\u03c6) are the basis vectors in the representation space L2 (S 1 ).\nWe finally write down the orthogonality and completeness conditions satisfied by the\nvectors |ji of the form\nhj|j \u2032 i = \u03b4jj \u2032 ,\n\u221e\nX\n|jihj| = I.\n\n(1.9)\n(1.10)\n\nj=\u2212\u221e\n\n2.\n\nCoherent states for the quantum mechanics on a circle\n\nWe now recall the construction of (non-deformed) coherent states for a quantum particle\non a circle described in [2], where the coherent states |\u03bei for a quantum particle on a\ncircle, are introduced as the solution of the eigenvalue equation\nZ|\u03bei = \u03be|\u03bei,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere\n1\n\nZ = e\u2212J+ 2 U.\n\n(2.2)\n\nThe convenient parametrization of \u03be consistent with the form (2.2) of the operator Z is\n\u03be = e\u2212l+i\u03b1 .\n\n(2.3)\n\n\f3\nWe point out that the parametrization (2.3) relies on the deformation of the cylinder\n(the phase space) specified by\nx = e\u2212l cos \u03b1,\n\ny = e\u2212l sin \u03b1,\n\nz = l,\n\n(2.4)\n\nand then projecting the points of the obtained surface onto the (x, y) (complex) plane.\nEvidently, we then identify the points of the cylinder with the plane with extracted\npoint (0, 0) (the origin).\nThe projection of the vectors |\u03bei onto the basis vectors |ji is given by\nj2\n\nhj|\u03bei = \u03be \u2212j e\u2212 2 .\n\n(2.5)\n\nMaking use of the parameters l, and \u03b1 we can write (2.5) in the following equivalent\nform:\nj2\n\nhj|l, \u03b1i = elj\u2212ij\u03b1e\u2212 2 ,\nwhere |l, \u03b1i \u2261 |\u03bei, with \u03be = e\u2212l+i\u03b1 .\nThe coherent states are not orthogonal. The overlap integral is [2]\n!\n\u221e\nX\ni\ni\n2\n,\nln \u03be \u2217 \u03b7\nh\u03be|\u03b7i =\n(\u03be \u2217\u03b7)\u2212j e\u2212j = \u03b83\n2\u03c0\n\u03c0\nj=\u2212\u221e\n\n(2.6)\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere \u03b83 is the Jacobi theta-function [6].\n3.\n\nq-deformed coherent states for a particle on a circle\n\nWe first introduce a q-deformation of the algebra (1.1). The general deformation of\nthe quantum mechanics on a circle was considered in [7]. In this work we consider a\nq-deformation of the algebra (1.1) generated only by U, Jq and the identity operator, of\nthe form\nqUJq = Jq U \u2212 U,\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere U is a unitary operator representing the position of a quantum particle on a\ncircle. We also restrict to the case of q > 0. The fact that q is real follows directly from\n(3.1) and the assumed hermicity of Jq and unitarity of U. Now, it can be easily verified\nthat the q-deformed angular momentum satisfying (3.1) is an element of the enveloping\nalgebra of (1.1) such that\nJq =\n\nqJ \u2212 1\n,\nq\u22121\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhile U remains undeformed. Clearly, Jq acts on the basis vectors |ji as follows:\nJq |ji = [j]q |ji,\n\n(3.3)\n\n\f4\nj\n\n\u22121\nis a quantum integer. Furthermore, using (1.4) and (3.2) we find that\nwhere [j]q = qq\u22121\nthe action of the operator Jq in L2 (S 1 ) is of the following form:\n\nJq f (ei\u03c6 ) = ei\u03c6 Dq f (ei\u03c6 ),\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhere Dq designates the Jackson derivative defined by\nf (qx) \u2212 f (x)\n,\n(q \u2212 1)x\n\nDq f (x) =\n\n(3.5)\n\nand we utilized the fact that in the discussed case of L2 (S 1 ) spanned by the functions\neij\u03c6 , where j is an integer, a 2\u03c0-periodic function of \u03c6 is assumed to have the Fourier\nseries expansion and it can be considered as a function of ei\u03c6 . Furthermore, taking into\naccount (3.2) we get\n[Jq , \u03c6\u0302] = \u2212i ln q Jq \u2212 i\n\nln q\n,\nq\u22121\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhere \u03c6\u0302 = \u2212i ln U. We remark that the commutator (3.6) is nontrivially defined except\nof the case q = 1 [8].\nNow we are in a position to define q-deformed coherent states for the quantum\nmechanics on a circle. Proceeding analogously as in the case of non-deformed coherent\nstates discussed in the previous section we define the q-deformed coherent states as a\nsolution of the eigenvalue equation\nZq |\u03beiq = \u03beq |\u03beiq ,\n\n(3.7)\n\nwhere\nZq := ei(\u03c6\u0302+iJq ) .\n\n(3.8)\n\nUsing (3.6) we find after some calculation\nZq = e\n\n1\n1\u2212q\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n1\u2212q \u22121\n\u22121\nln q\n\ne\n\nq \u22121 \u22121\nJq\nln q\n\nU.\n\n(3.9)\n\nTaking into account (3.7), (3.9), (3.3) and (1.6b) we get\n1\n\nhj|\u03beiq = \u03beq\u2212j e\u2212 ln q\n\nq j \u22121\nq\u22121\n\nj\n\ne\u2212 1\u2212q .\n\n(3.10)\n\nNow, the form of the operator (3.8) and (2.3) indicate the following parametrization of\na complex number \u03beq :\n\u03beq = e\u2212[l]q +i\u03b1 ,\nl\n\n(3.11)\n\n\u22121\n, where l is a real number, is quantum l. It should be noted that\nwhere [l]q = qq\u22121\nfor 0 < q < 1, [l]q is an increasing function of l and it has an upper bound 1/(1 \u2212 q)\napproached in the limit l \u2192 +\u221e. Consequently, (see (2.4)) in the case of 0 < q < 1,\nwe identify the points of the q-deformed classical phase space with the (x, y) plane with\n\n\f5\n2\n\u2212 1\u2212q\n\n. Evidently, this disk reduces to the point (0, 0), i.e. the\nextracted disk x2 + y 2 \u2264 e\norigin, in the limit q \u2192 1 referring to the non-deformed case. In the case of q > 1, [l]q\nis also an increasing function and it has a lower bound \u22121/(q \u2212 1) reached in the limit\nl \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Therefore in this case we identify the points of the deformed classical phase\n2\nspace with the disk x2 + y 2 < e q\u22121 , with extracted point (0, 0). Obviously, in the limit\nq \u2192 1 corresponding to the non-deformed case, the disk is simply the plane (x, y) with\nextracted origin.\nUsing (3.11) we can write (3.10) in the form\n1\n\nhj|l, \u03b1iq = e\u2212ij\u03b1 e\u2212 ln q\n\nq j \u22121\nq\u22121\n\nql\n\ne\u2212 1\u2212q j ,\n\n(3.12)\n\nwhere |l, \u03b1iq \u2261 |\u03beiq , and \u03beq referring via (3.7) to |\u03beiq , is given by (3.11). Clearly, the\nrelation (2.6) refers to the limit q \u2192 1 in (3.12). We recall that the functions (2.6) span\nthe Bargmann representation [2]. The problem of finding the Bargmann representation\nin the discussed case of the q-deformed coherent states for a quantum particle on a circle\nis complicated and it will be discussed in a separate work.\nThe coherent states are not orthogonal. Indeed, making use of (3.12) and (1.10) we\nfind\n\u221e\nX\nq j \u22121\nq l +q h\ni(\u03b1\u2212\u03b2)j \u2212 ln2q q\u22121 \u2212 1\u2212q j\ne\n.\n(3.13)\ne\ne\nhl,\n\u03b1|h,\n\u03b2i\n=\nq\nq\nj=\u2212\u221e\n\nIn the limit q \u2192 1 we recover from (3.13) the following formula [2]:\n!\nl+h i i\n1\n.\n(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2) \u2212\nhl, \u03b1|h, \u03b2i = \u03b83\n2\u03c0\n2 \u03c0 \u03c0\n\n(3.14)\n\nIt follows immediately from (3.13) that the discussed coherent states are not normalized.\nNamely, we have\nq hl, \u03b1|l, \u03b1iq =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n2\n\ne\u2212 ln q\n\nq j \u22121\nq\u22121\n\n2q l\n\ne\u2212 1\u2212q j .\n\n(3.15)\n\nj=\u2212\u221e\n\nFor q = 1 this relation reduces to\nhl, \u03b1|l, \u03b1i =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n2\n\ne2lj e\u2212j = \u03b83\n\nj=\u2212\u221e\n\nil i\n\u03c0 \u03c0\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(3.16)\n\nOne can easily check that the series (3.15) is convergent for arbitrary (positive) q and\n(finite) l. Therefore, by virtue of the Schwartz's inequality the series (3.13) is also\nconvergent for arbitrary q and l. We finally write down the formula on the coherent\nstates in L2 (S 1 ) following directly from (1.8), (1.10) and (3.12) such that\nh\u03c6|l, \u03b1iq =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nj=\u2212\u221e\n\n1\n\neij(\u03c6\u2212\u03b1) e\u2212 ln q\n\nq j \u22121\nq\u22121\n\nql\n\ne\u2212 1\u2212q j .\n\n(3.17)\n\n\f6\nIn the limit q \u2192 1 this formula takes the form\n!\n1\ni\nh\u03c6|l, \u03b1i = \u03b83\n.\n(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03b1 \u2212 il)\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n\n(3.18)\n\nNotice that in view of (3.14), (3.16) and (3.18) the series from the right-hand side of\n(3.13), (3.15) and (3.17), respectively, can be regarded as q-deformations of the Jacobi\ntheta functions.\n4.\n\nq-deformed coherent states and the classical phase space\n\nIn this section we discuss the parametrization (3.11) of the deformed phase space in\na more detail. Consider the expectation value of the deformed angular momentum\noperator Jq given by (3.2). On using (1.10), (3.3) and (3.12) we arrive at the following\nrelation:\nq j \u22121\n2q l\nP\u221e\nq j \u22121 \u2212 ln2q q\u22121 \u2212 1\u2212q j\ne\ne\nhl,\n\u03b1|J\n|l,\n\u03b1i\nj=\u2212\u221e\nq\nq\nq\nq\u22121\n.\n(4.1)\n= P\nj \u22121\n2q l\n\u221e\n\u2212 ln2q qq\u22121\n\u2212 1\u2212q\nj\nhl,\n\u03b1|l,\n\u03b1i\nq\nq\ne\nj=\u2212\u221e e\n\nIt follows from numerical calculations that there are large regions of the phase space\nparametrized by q and l such that\nq hl, \u03b1|Jq |l, \u03b1iq\n\u2248 [l]q ,\n(4.2)\nq hl, \u03b1|l, \u03b1iq\nwhere the approximation is very good. For example, for q = 0.5, and l \u2265 0.3 the\nmaximal relative error is of order 1 per cent. The fact that (4.2) is not valid for\narbitrary q and l is not surprising. We only recall that in the case of the coherent\nstates for the quantum mechanics on a sphere [9] we have a condition |l| \u2265 10, where\n|l| is the norm of the vector l of the classical angular momentum parametrizing the\ncoherent states, ensuring the (approximate) coincidence of the average of the angular\nmomentum operator and l. In our opinion, the meaning of the approximate relations\nlike (4.2) is that the coherent states are as close as possible to the classical phase space.\nWe conclude that the parameter [l]q in (3.11) can be regarded as a deformed version\nof the classical angular momentum. Let us finally recall that in the limit q \u2192 1, when\n(4.1) reduces to\n!\n1\nd\nil i\nhl, \u03c6|J|l, \u03c6i\n\u0001 \u03b83\n(4.3)\n=\nhl, \u03c6|l, \u03c6i\n\u03c0 \u03c0\n2\u03b83 \u03c0il \u03c0i dl\n= l \u2212 2\u03c0 sin(2l\u03c0)\n\n\u221e\nX\nn=1\n\n2\n\ne\u2212\u03c0 (2n\u22121)\n,\n(1 + e\u2212\u03c02 (2n\u22121) e2il\u03c0 )(1 + e\u2212\u03c02 (2n\u22121) e\u22122il\u03c0 )\n\nwe have a perfect approximation of the classical phase space for arbitrary l [2]. Namely,\nthe maximal error of (4.2) is of order 0.1 per cent, and we have the exact equality in\nthe case with l integer or half-integer.\n\n\f7\nWe now examine the role of the parameter \u03b1 in the parametrization (3.11). Taking\ninto account (1.10), (1.6a) and (3.12) we find\nl\nq l \u22121\nq j \u22121\n1 P\n\u221e\n\u2212 1+q\n\u2212 ln1q \u2212 1\u2212q\n\u2212 2q j\nq\u22121\nln q q\u22121 e 1\u2212q\ne\ne\nhl,\n\u03b1|U|l,\n\u03b1i\nj=\u2212\u221e\nq\nq\n= ei\u03b1\n.\n(4.4)\nj \u22121\n2q l\nP\n\u221e\nhl,\n\u03b1|l,\n\u03b1i\n\u2212 1\u2212q\nj\n\u2212 ln2q qq\u22121\nq\nq\ne\ne\nj=\u2212\u221e\n\nIn the limit q \u2192 this formula takes the form\n\u0001\n\u0001\nil i\n1\nhl, \u03b1|U|l, \u03b1i\n\u2212 41 i\u03b1 \u03b82 \u03c0 \u03c0\n\u2212 41 i\u03b1 \u03b83 l + 2 i\u03c0\n\u0001 .\n\u0001 =e e\n=e e\nhl, \u03b1|l, \u03b1i\n\u03b83 l i\u03c0\n\u03b83 \u03c0il \u03c0i\n\n(4.5)\n\nProceeding analogously as in [2] we define the relative expectation value\nq hhUii(l,\u03b1)\n\n=\n\nq hUi(l,\u03b1)\nq hUi(l,0)\n\n,\n\n(4.6)\n\nwhere q hUi(l,\u03b1) = q hl, \u03b1|U|l, \u03b1iq /q hl, \u03b1|l, \u03b1iq . Hence\nq hhUii(l,\u03b1)\n\n= ei\u03b1 .\n\n(4.7)\n\nTherefore, the parameter \u03b1 labelling the coherent states can be identified with the\nclassical angle.\nWe now study the distribution of eigenvectors |ji's of the operator Jq in the\nnormalized coherent state. We recall that in the non-deformed case this is the\ndistribution of energies of a quantum particle moving freely in a (unit) circle [2]. The\ncomputer simulations indicate that the function (see (3.12) and (3.15))\n2\n\nq j \u22121\n\n2q l\n\ne\u2212 ln q q\u22121 e\u2212 1\u2212q j\n|hj|l, \u03b1iq |2\n,\n=P\npl,q (j) =\nj \u22121\n2q l\n\u221e\n\u2212 ln2q qq\u22121\n\u2212 1\u2212q\nj\nq hl, \u03b1|l, \u03b1iq\ne\ne\n\n(4.8)\n\nj=\u2212\u221e\n\nwhich gives the probability of finding the\np system in the state |ji when the system is\nin the normalized coherent state |l, \u03b1iq / q hl, \u03b1|l, \u03b1iq , has the behaviour the same as in\nthe non-deformed case, that is pl,q (x) is peaked at x = l. However, in opposition to the\ndistribution referring to the non-deformed coherent states, when q = 1, which is the\n\"discrete\" Gaussian distribution of the form [2]\n2\n\npl (j) =\n\n2\n\ne2lj e\u2212j\n|hj|l, \u03b1i|2\ne\u2212(j\u2212l)\n\u0001\n\u221a ,\n=\n\u2248\nhl, \u03b1|l, \u03b1i\n\u03c0\n\u03b83 \u03c0il \u03c0i\n\n(4.9)\n\nwhere the approximation is very good, the distribution (4.8) is asymmetrical one (see\nfigure 1).\nWe finally discuss the probability\ndensity p(l,\u03b1),q (\u03c6) for the coordinates in the\np\nnormalized coherent state |l, \u03b1iq / q hl, \u03b1|l, \u03b1iq , of the form (see (3.17))\n|h\u03c6|l, \u03b1iq |2\np(l,\u03b1),q (\u03c6) =\n=\nq hl, \u03b1|l, \u03b1iq\n\nP\u221e\n\n1\n\nq j \u22121\n\nql\n\n2\n\nij(\u03c6\u2212\u03b1) \u2212 ln q q\u22121 \u2212 1\u2212q j\ne\ne\nj=\u2212\u221e e\n.\n2q l\nP\u221e\n2 q j \u22121\n\u2212 ln q q\u22121 \u2212 1\u2212q j\ne\nj=\u2212\u221e e\n\n(4.10)\n\n\f8\nAs with the non-deformed case (see (3.18) and (3.16)) the function p(l,\u03b1),q (\u03c6) is peaked\nat \u03c6 = \u03b1 (see figure 2). Therefore, the parameter \u03b1 in (3.11) can be really regarded as\nthe classical angle.\n5.\n\nA generalization of the q-deformed coherent states\n\nWe finally study a generalization of the q-deformed coherent states discussed above\narising from taking into consideration the so called \"squeezed states\" introduced in\n[10]. These states amount a generalization of the non-deformed coherent states for the\nquantum mechanics on a circle introduced in [2] and can be regarded as a version of the\ncoherent states on a circle introduced in [3]. Namely, they can be defined as a solution\nof the eigenvalue equation generalizing (2.1) such that [10]\nZ(s)|\u03beis = \u03be|\u03beis,\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere\n\u0010\n\n\u2212s J\u2212\n\nZ(s) = e\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0011\n\nU,\n\n(5.2)\n\nand s > 0 is a real parameter. Clearly, the case of s = 1 corresponds to the coherent\nstates discussed in section 2. An attempt to provide a physical interpretation of this\ndimensionless parameter was made in [3] and [11], where it is suggested that it controls\nthe ratio of spatial width of the coherent states to the length of the circle. The\ncounterparts of the relations (2.5) and (2.7) are of the form\nsj 2\n\nhj|\u03beis = \u03be \u2212j e\u2212 2 ,\n\u221e\nX\n2\n(\u03be \u2217 \u03b7)\u2212j e\u2212sj = \u03b83\ns h\u03be|\u03b7is =\nj=\u2212\u221e\n\n(5.3)\ni\nis\nln \u03be \u2217 \u03b7\n2\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(5.4)\n\nNow, we define the generalized q-deformed coherent states for the quantum mechanics\non a circle as the solution of the eigenvalue equation\nZq (s)|\u03beis,q = \u03beq |\u03beis,q ,\n\n(5.5)\n\nwhere\ni(\u03c6\u0302+isJq )\n\nZq (s) := e\n\n=e\n\ns\n1\u2212q\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n1\u2212q \u22121\n\u22121\nln q\n\ne\n\ns(q \u22121 \u22121)\nJq\nln q\n\nU.\n\n(5.6)\n\nOf course, the states |\u03beiq given by (3.7) refer to the case with s = 1. Using (5.5) and\n(5.6) we easily obtain the following generalizations of the relations (3.10), (3.13) and\n(3.15), respectively:\ns\n\nq j \u22121\n\nsj\n\nhj|\u03beis,q = \u03beq\u2212j e\u2212 ln q q\u22121 e\u2212 1\u2212q ,\n\u221e\nj\nX\n2(1\u2212s)\nq l +q h\n2s q \u22121\nei(\u03b1\u2212\u03b2)j e\u2212 ln q q\u22121 e\u2212 1\u2212q j e 1\u2212q j ,\ns,q hl, \u03b1|h, \u03b2is,q =\nj=\u2212\u221e\n\n(5.7)\n(5.8)\n\n\f9\ns,q hl, \u03b1|l, \u03b1is,q =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nj\n2s q \u22121\nq\u22121\n\ne\u2212 ln q\n\n2q l\n\ne\u2212 1\u2212q j e\n\n2(1\u2212s)\nj\n1\u2212q\n\n.\n\n(5.9)\n\nj=\u2212\u221e\n\nApplying the d'Alambert ratio test we find that the series (5.9) is not convergent for\narbitrary (positive) s. Namely, it follows that it is convergent if q l > 1\u2212s, and divergent\nif q l < 1 \u2212 s. Notice that these conditions seem to distinguish the case s = 1 discussed\nearlier, because only if s = 1 the series (5.9) is convergent for arbitrary l.\n6.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this work we have introduced the q-deformed coherent states for the quantum\nmechanics on a circle. The correctness of the construction is confirmed by the quasiclassical character of the coherent states manifested for example by the behaviour of\nthe expectation values of the deformed angular momentum operator. It is worthwhile\nto recall that the non-deformed coherent states specified by (2.1) as well as the coherent\nstates of a quantum particle on a sphere introduced by us in [9] are concrete realization\nof the general mathematical scheme of construction of the Bargmann spaces introduced\nin the recent papers [11], [12] and [13]. Thus, bearing in mind the observations presented\nherein, an interesting problem naturally arises of finding deformations of coherent states\nfor the quantum mechanics on a sphere. It should be noted that in view of the\nobservations of Dimakis and M\u00fcller-Hoissen [14] one can relate by the suitable change\nof variables, the q-deformation of the quantum mechanics on a circle described by the\nJackson derivative (3.5) with a discrete quantum mechanics on a lattice. We finally\nremark that the results of this paper would be of importance in the theory of special\nfunctions. We only recall that the formulae (3.13), (3.15) and (3.17) describe a quantum\ndeformation of the Jacobi theta functions.\nAcknowledgments\nThis paper has been supported by the Polish Ministry of Scientific Research and\nInformation Technology under the grant No PBZ-MIN-008/P03/2003.\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n\nCondon E U 1928 Phys.
