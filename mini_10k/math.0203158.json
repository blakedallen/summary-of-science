This is a survey paper on the construction\nof examples of compact 7- and 8-manifolds with holonomy G2 and Spin(7).\nAll of the material described can be found in the author's book [9]. Some,\nbut not all, is also in the papers [5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11]. In particular, the most\ncomplicated and powerful form of the construction of compact manifolds with\nexceptional holonomy by resolving orbifolds T n /\u0393, and many of the examples,\nare given only in [9] and not in any published paper.\nThe rest of this section introduces the holonomy groups G2 , Spin(7) and\nSU(m), and the relations between them. Section 2 discusses constructions for\ncompact 7-manifolds with holonomy G2 . Most of the section explains how to\ndo this by resolving the singularities of orbifolds T 7 /\u0393, but in \u00a72.5 we briefly\ndiscuss two other methods starting from Calabi\u2013Yau 3-folds.\nSection 3 explains constructions for compact 8-manifolds with holonomy\nSpin(7). One way to do this is to resolve orbifolds T 8 /\u0393, but as this is very\nsimilar in outline to the G2 material of \u00a72 we say little about it. Instead we\ndescribe a second construction which begins with a Calabi\u2013Yau 4-orbifold.\n\n1.1\n\nRiemannian holonomy groups\n\nLet M be a connected n-dimensional manifold, g a Riemannian metric on M ,\nand \u2207 the Levi-Civita connection of g. Let x, y be points in M joined by a\nsmooth path \u03b3. Then parallel transport along \u03b3 using \u2207 defines an isometry\nbetween the tangent spaces Tx M , Ty M at x and y.\nDefinition 1.1 The holonomy group Hol(g) of g is the group of isometries\nof Tx M generated by parallel transport around piecewise-smooth closed loops\nbased at x in M . We consider Hol(g) to be a subgroup of O(n), defined up to\n1\n\n\fconjugation by elements of O(n). Then Hol(g) is independent of the base point\nx in M .\nThe classification of holonomy groups was achieved by Berger [1] in 1955.\nTheorem 1.2 Let M be a simply-connected, n-dimensional manifold, and g\nan irreducible, nonsymmetric Riemannian metric on M . Then either\n(i) Hol(g) = SO(n),\n(ii) n = 2m and Hol(g) = SU(m) or U(m),\n(iii) n = 4m and Hol(g) = Sp(m) or Sp(m) Sp(1),\n(iv) n = 7 and Hol(g) = G2 , or\n(v) n = 8 and Hol(g) = Spin(7).\nNow G2 and Spin(7) are the exceptional cases in this classification, so they\nare called the exceptional holonomy groups. For some time after Berger's classification, the exceptional holonomy groups remained a mystery. In 1987, Bryant\n[2] used the theory of exterior differential systems to show that locally there\nexist many metrics with these holonomy groups, and gave some explicit, incomplete examples. Then in 1989, Bryant and Salamon [3] found explicit, complete\nmetrics with holonomy G2 and Spin(7) on noncompact manifolds.\nIn 1994-5 the author constructed the first examples of metrics with holonomy\nG2 and Spin(7) on compact manifolds [5, 6, 7]. These, and the more complicated\nconstructions developed later by the author [8, 9] and by Kovalev [12], are the\nsubject of this article.\n\n1.2\n\nThe holonomy group G2\n\nLet (x1 , . . . , x7 ) be coordinates on R7 . Write dxij...l for the exterior form dxi \u2227\ndxj \u2227 * * * \u2227 dxl on R7 . Define a metric g0 , a 3-form \u03c60 and a 4-form \u2217\u03c60 on R7\nby g0 = dx21 + * * * + dx27 ,\n\u03c60 = dx123 + dx145 + dx167 + dx246 \u2212 dx257 \u2212 dx347 \u2212 dx356 and\n\u2217\u03c60 = dx4567 + dx2367 + dx2345 + dx1357 \u2212 dx1346 \u2212 dx1256 \u2212 dx1247 .\n\n(1)\n\nThe subgroup of GL(7, R) preserving \u03c60 is the exceptional Lie group G2 . It\nalso preserves g0 , \u2217\u03c60 and the orientation on R7 . It is a compact, semisimple,\n14-dimensional Lie group, a subgroup of SO(7).\nA G2 -structure on a 7-manifold M is a principal subbundle of the frame\nbundle of M , with structure group G2 . Each G2 -structure gives rise to a 3form \u03c6 and a metric g on M , such that every tangent space of M admits an\nisomorphism with R7 identifying \u03c6 and g with \u03c60 and g0 respectively. By an\nabuse of notation, we will refer to (\u03c6, g) as a G2 -structure.\nProposition 1.3 Let M be a 7-manifold and (\u03c6, g) a G2 -structure on M . Then\nthe following are equivalent:\n2\n\n\f(i) Hol(g) \u2286 G2 , and \u03c6 is the induced 3-form,\n(ii) \u2207\u03c6 = 0 on M , where \u2207 is the Levi-Civita connection of g, and\n(iii) d\u03c6 = d\u2217 \u03c6 = 0 on M .\nWe call \u2207\u03c6 the torsion of the G2 -structure (\u03c6, g), and when \u2207\u03c6 = 0 the\nG2 -structure is torsion-free. A triple (M, \u03c6, g) is called a G2 -manifold if M is\na 7-manifold and (\u03c6, g) a torsion-free G2 -structure on M . If g has holonomy\nHol(g) \u2286 G2 , then g is Ricci-flat.\nTheorem 1.4 Let M be a compact 7-manifold, and suppose that (\u03c6, g) is a\ntorsion-free G2 -structure on M . Then Hol(g) = G2 if and only if \u03c01 (M ) is\nfinite. In this case the moduli space of metrics with holonomy G2 on M , up\nto diffeomorphisms isotopic to the identity, is a smooth manifold of dimension b3 (M ).\n\nThe holonomy group Spin(7)\n\n1.3\n8\n\nLet R have coordinates (x1 , . . . , x8 ). Define a 4-form \u03a90 on R8 by\n\u03a90 = dx1234 + dx1256 + dx1278 + dx1357 \u2212 dx1368 \u2212 dx1458 \u2212 dx1467\n\u2212dx2358 \u2212 dx2367 \u2212 dx2457 + dx2468 + dx3456 + dx3478 + dx5678 .\n\n(2)\n\nThe subgroup of GL(8, R) preserving \u03a90 is the holonomy group Spin(7). It also\npreserves the orientation on R8 and the Euclidean metric g0 = dx21 + * * * + dx28 .\nIt is a compact, semisimple, 21-dimensional Lie group, a subgroup of SO(8).\nA Spin(7)-structure on an 8-manifold M gives rise to a 4-form \u03a9 and a metric\ng on M , such that each tangent space of M admits an isomorphism with R8\nidentifying \u03a9 and g with \u03a90 and g0 respectively. By an abuse of notation we\nwill refer to the pair (\u03a9, g) as a Spin(7)-structure.\nProposition 1.5 Let M be an 8-manifold and (\u03a9, g) a Spin(7)-structure on\nM . Then the following are equivalent:\n(i) Hol(g) \u2286 Spin(7), and \u03a9 is the induced 4-form,\n(ii) \u2207\u03a9 = 0 on M , where \u2207 is the Levi-Civita connection of g, and\n(iii) d\u03a9 = 0 on M .\nWe call \u2207\u03a9 the torsion of the Spin(7)-structure (\u03a9, g), and (\u03a9, g) torsionfree if \u2207\u03a9 = 0. A triple (M, \u03a9, g) is called a Spin(7)-manifold if M is an\n8-manifold and (\u03a9, g) a torsion-free Spin(7)-structure on M . If g has holonomy\nHol(g) \u2286 Spin(7), then g is Ricci-flat.\nHere is a result on compact 8-manifolds with holonomy Spin(7).\nTheorem 1.6 Let (M, \u03a9, g) be a compact Spin(7)-manifold. Then Hol(g) =\nSpin(7) if and only if M is simply-connected, and b3 (M ) + b4+ (M ) = b2 (M ) +\nb4\u2212 (M ) + 25. In this case the moduli space of metrics with holonomy Spin(7)\non M , up to diffeomorphisms isotopic to the identity, is a smooth manifold of\ndimension 1 + b4\u2212 (M ).\n3\n\n\f1.4\n\nThe holonomy groups SU(m)\n\nLet Cm \u223c\n= R2m have complex coordinates (z1 , . . . , zm ), and define the metric\ng0 , K\u00e4hler form \u03c90 and complex volume form \u03b80 on Cm by\ni\n(dz1 \u2227 dz\u03041 + * * * + dzm \u2227 dz\u0304m ),\n2\nand \u03b80 = dz1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 dzm .\n\ng0 = |dz1 |2 + * * * + |dzm |2 ,\n\n\u03c90 =\n\n(3)\n\nThe subgroup of GL(2m, R) preserving g0 , \u03c90 and \u03b80 is the special unitary group\nSU(m). Manifolds with holonomy SU(m) are called Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds.\nCalabi\u2013Yau manifolds are automatically Ricci-flat and K\u00e4hler, with trivial\ncanonical bundle. Conversely, any Ricci-flat K\u00e4hler manifold (M, J, g) with\ntrivial canonical bundle has Hol(g) \u2286 SU(m). By Yau's proof of the Calabi\nconjecture [16], we have:\nTheorem 1.7 Let (M, J) be a compact complex m-manifold admitting K\u00e4hler\nmetrics, with trivial canonical bundle. Then there is a unique Ricci-flat K\u00e4hler\nmetric g in each K\u00e4hler class on M , and Hol(g) \u2286 SU(m).\nUsing this and complex algebraic geometry one can construct many examples\nof compact Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds. The theorem also applies in the orbifold\ncategory, yielding examples of Calabi\u2013Yau orbifolds.\n\n1.5\n\nRelations between G2 , Spin(7) and SU(m)\n\nHere are the inclusions between the holonomy groups SU(m), G2 and Spin(7):\nSU(2)\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 SU(3) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\n\nG2\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\n\nSU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 SU(4) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Spin(7).\nWe shall illustrate what we mean by this using the inclusion SU(3) \u0592\u2192 G2 . As\nSU(3) acts on C3 , it also acts on R \u2295 C3 \u223c\n= R7 , taking the SU(3)-action on R to\nbe trivial. Thus we embed SU(3) as a subgroup of GL(7, R). It turns out that\nSU(3) is a subgroup of the subgroup G2 of GL(7, R) defined in \u00a71.2.\nHere is a way to see this in terms of differential forms. Identify R \u2295 C3 with\u0001\n7\nR in the obvious way in coordinates, so that x1 , (x2 + ix3 , x4 + ix5 , x6 + ix7 )\nin R \u2295 C3 is identified with (x1 , . . . , x7 ) in R7 . Then \u03c60 = dx1 \u2227 \u03c90 + Re \u03b80 ,\nwhere \u03c60 is defined in (1) and \u03c90 , \u03b80 in (3). Since SU(3) preserves \u03c90 and \u03b80 ,\nthe action of SU(3) on R7 preserves \u03c60 , and so SU(3) \u2282 G2 .\nIt follows that if (M, J, h) is Calabi\u2013Yau 3-fold, then R \u00d7 M and S 1 \u00d7 M\nhave torsion-free G2 -structures, that is, are G2 -manifolds.\nProposition 1.8 Let (M, J, h) be a Calabi\u2013Yau 3-fold, with K\u00e4hler form \u03c9\nand complex volume form \u03b8. Let x be a coordinate on R or S 1 . Define a metric\ng = dx2 + h and a 3-form \u03c6 = dx\u2227\u03c9 + Re \u03b8 on R\u00d7 M or S 1 \u00d7 M .

Define a 4-form \u03a9 on M by \u03a9 = 21 \u03c9 \u2227 \u03c9 + Re \u03b8.\nThen (\u03a9, g) is a torsion-free Spin(7)-structure on M .\n\n2\n\nConstructing G2 -manifolds from orbifolds T 7/\u0393\n\nWe now explain the method used in [5, 6] and [9, \u00a711\u2013\u00a712] to construct examples of compact 7-manifolds with holonomy G2 . It is based on the Kummer\nconstruction for Calabi\u2013Yau metrics on the K3 surface, and may be divided\ninto four steps.\nStep 1. Let T 7 be the 7-torus and (\u03c60 , g0 ) a flat G2 -structure on T 7 . Choose a\nfinite group \u0393 of isometries of T 7 preserving (\u03c60 , g0 ). Then the quotient\nT 7 /\u0393 is a singular, compact 7-manifold, an orbifold.\nStep 2. For certain special groups \u0393 there is a method to resolve the singularities\nof T 7 /\u0393 in a natural way, using complex geometry. We get a nonsingular, compact 7-manifold M , together with a map \u03c0 : M \u2192 T 7 /\u0393, the\nresolving map.\nStep 3. On M , we explicitly write down a 1-parameter family of G2 -structures\n(\u03c6t , gt ) depending on t \u2208 (0, \u01eb). They are not torsion-free, but have small\ntorsion when t is small. As t \u2192 0, the G2 -structure (\u03c6t , gt ) converges\nto the singular G2 -structure \u03c0 \u2217 (\u03c60 , g0 ).\nStep 4. We prove using analysis that for sufficiently small t, the G2 -structure\n(\u03c6t , gt ) on M , with small torsion, can be deformed to a G2 -structure\n(\u03c6\u0303t , g\u0303t ), with zero torsion. Finally, we show that g\u0303t is a metric with\nholonomy G2 on the compact 7-manifold M .\nWe will now explain each step in greater detail.\n\n5\n\n\f2.1\n\nStep 1: Choosing an orbifold\n\nLet (\u03c60 , g0 ) be the Euclidean G2 -structure on R7 defined in \u00a71.2. Suppose \u039b\nis a lattice in R7 , that is, a discrete additive subgroup isomorphic to Z7 . Then\nR7 /\u039b is the torus T 7 , and (\u03c60 , g0 ) pushes down to a torsion-free G2 -structure\non T 7 . We must choose a finite group \u0393 acting on T 7 preserving (\u03c60 , g0 ). That\nis, the elements of \u0393 are the push-forwards to T 7 /\u039b of affine transformations of\nR7 which fix (\u03c60 , g0 ), and take \u039b to itself under conjugation.\nHere is an example of a suitable group \u0393, taken from [9, \u00a712.2].\nExample 2.1 Let (x1 , . . . , x7 ) be coordinates on T 7 = R7 /Z7 , where xi \u2208 R/Z.\nLet (\u03c60 , g0 ) be the flat G2 -structure on T 7 defined by (1). Let \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 be\nthe involutions of T 7 defined by\n\u03b1 : (x1 , . . . , x7 ) 7\u2192 (x1 , x2 , x3 , \u2212x4 , \u2212x5 , \u2212x6 , \u2212x7 ),\n\u03b2 : (x1 , . . . , x7 ) 7\u2192\n\u03b3 : (x1 , . . . , x7 ) 7\u2192\n\n(x1 , \u2212x2 , \u2212x3 , x4 , x5 , 21 \u2212 x6 , \u2212x7 ),\n\u2212x1 , x2 , \u2212x3 , x4 , 12 \u2212 x5 , x6 , 12 \u2212 x7 ).\n\n(6)\n(7)\n(8)\n\nBy inspection, \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 preserve (\u03c60 , g0 ), because of the careful choice of\nexactly which signs to change. Also, \u03b12 = \u03b2 2 = \u03b3 2 = 1, and \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3\ncommute. Thus they generate a group \u0393 = h\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3i \u223c\n= Z32 of isometries of T 7\npreserving the flat G2 -structure (\u03c60 , g0 ).\nHaving chosen a lattice \u039b and finite group \u0393, the quotient T 7 /\u0393 is an orbifold,\na singular manifold with only quotient singularities. The singularities of T 7 /\u0393\ncome from the fixed points of non-identity elements of \u0393. We now describe the\nsingularities in our example.\nLemma 2.2 In Example 2.1, \u03b2\u03b3, \u03b3\u03b1, \u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 have no fixed points on T 7 .\nThe fixed points of \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 are each 16 copies of T 3 . The singular set S of\nT 7 /\u0393 is a disjoint union of 12 copies of T 3 , 4 copies from each of \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3.\nEach component of S is a singularity modelled on that of T 3 \u00d7 C2 /{\u00b11}.\nThe most important consideration in choosing \u0393 is that we should be able\nto resolve the singularities of T 7 /\u0393 within holonomy G2 . We will explain how\nto do this next.\n\n2.2\n\nStep 2: Resolving the singularities\n\nOur goal is to resolve the singular set S of T 7 /\u0393 to get a compact 7-manifold\nM with holonomy G2 . How can we do this? In general we cannot, because\nwe have no idea of how to resolve general orbifold singularities with holonomy\nG2 . However, suppose we can arrange that every connected component of S is\nlocally isomorphic to either\n(a) T 3 \u00d7 C2 /G, for G a finite subgroup of SU(2), or\n(b) S 1 \u00d7 C3 /G, for G a finite subgroup of SU(3) acting freely on C3 \\ {0}.\n\n6\n\n\fOne can use complex algebraic geometry to find a crepant resolution X of\nC2 /G or Y of C3 /G. Then T 3 \u00d7 X or S 1 \u00d7 Y gives a local model for how\nto resolve the corresponding component of S in T 7 /\u0393. Thus we construct a\nnonsingular, compact 7-manifold M by using the patches T 3 \u00d7 X or S 1 \u00d7 Y to\nrepair the singularities of T 7 /\u0393. In the case of Example 2.1, this means gluing 12\ncopies of T 3 \u00d7 X into T 7 /\u0393, where X is the blow-up of C2 /{\u00b11} at its singular\npoint.\nNow the point of using crepant resolutions is this. In both case (a) and\n(b), there exists a Calabi\u2013Yau metric on X or Y which is asymptotic to the\nflat Euclidean metric on C2 /G or C3 /G. Such metrics are called Asymptotically Locally Euclidean (ALE). In case (a), the ALE Calabi\u2013Yau metrics were\nclassified by Kronheimer [13, 14], and exist for all finite G \u2282 SU(2). In case\n(b), crepant resolutions of C3 /G exist for all finite G \u2282 SU(3) by Roan [15],\nand the author [10], [9, \u00a78] proved that they carry ALE Calabi\u2013Yau, using a\nnoncompact version of the Calabi Conjecture.\nBy Propositions 1.8 and 1.9, we can use the Calabi\u2013Yau metrics on X or Y\nto construct a torsion-free G2 -structure on T 3 \u00d7 X or S 1 \u00d7 Y . This gives a local\nmodel for how to resolve the singularity T 3 \u00d7C2 /G or S 1 \u00d7C3 /G with holonomy\nG2 . So, this method gives not only a way to smooth out the singularities of T 7 /\u0393\nas a manifold, but also a family of torsion-free G2 -structures on the resolution\nwhich show how to smooth out the singularities of the G2 -structure.\nThe requirement above that S be divided into connected components of the\nform (a) and (b) is in fact unnecessarily restrictive. There is a more complicated\nand powerful method, described in [9, \u00a711\u2013\u00a712], for resolving singularities of a\nmore general kind. We require only that the singularities should locally be of\nthe form R3 \u00d7 C2 /G or R \u00d7 C3 /G, for G a finite subgroup of SU(2) or SU(3),\nand when G \u2282 SU(3) we do not require that G act freely on C3 \\ {0}.\nIf X is a crepant resolution of C3 /G, where G does not act freely on C3 \\ {0},\nthen the author shows [9, \u00a79], [11] that X carries a family of Calabi\u2013Yau metrics satisfying a complicated asymptotic condition at infinity, called Quasi-ALE\nmetrics. These yield the local models necessary to resolve singularities locally of\nthe form R \u00d7 C3 /G with holonomy G2 . Using this method we can resolve many\norbifolds T 7 /\u0393, and prove the existence of large numbers of compact 7-manifolds\nwith holonomy G2 .\n\n2.3\n\nStep 3: Finding G2 -structures with small torsion\n\nFor each resolution X of C2 /G in case (a), and Y of C3 /G in case (b) above,\nwe can find a 1-parameter family {ht : t > 0} of metrics with the properties\n(a) ht is a K\u00e4hler metric on X with Hol(ht ) = SU(2). Its injectivity radius satisfies \u03b4(ht ) = O(t), its Riemann curvature satisfies R(ht ) C 0 = O(t\u22122 ),\nand ht = h + O(t4 r\u22124 ) for large r, where h is the Euclidean metric on\nC2 /G, and r the distance from the origin.\n(b) ht is K\u00e4hler on Y with Hol(ht ) = SU(3), where \u03b4(ht ) = O(t), R(ht )\nO(t\u22122 ), and ht = h + O(t6 r\u22126 ) for large r.\n7\n\nC0\n\n=\n\n\fIn fact we can choose ht to be isometric to t2 h1 , and the properties above are\neasy to prove.\nSuppose one of the components of the singular set S of T 7 /\u0393 is locally\nmodelled on T 3 \u00d7 C2 /G. Then T 3 has a natural flat metric hT 3 . Let X be\nthe crepant resolution of C2 /G and let {ht : t > 0} satisfy property (a). Then\nProposition 1.9 gives a 1-parameter family of torsion-free G2 -structures (\u03c6\u0302t , \u011dt )\non T 3 \u00d7 X with \u011dt = hT 3 + ht . Similarly, if a component of S is modelled on\nS 1 \u00d7 C3 /G, using Proposition 1.8 we get a family of torsion-free G2 -structures\n(\u03c6\u0302t , \u011dt ) on S 1 \u00d7 Y .\nThe idea is to make a G2 -structure (\u03c6t , gt ) on M by gluing together the\ntorsion-free G2 -structures (\u03c6\u0302t , \u011dt ) on the patches T 3 \u00d7 X and S 1 \u00d7 Y , and\n(\u03c60 , g0 ) on T 7 /\u0393. The gluing is done using a partition of unity. Naturally, the\nfirst derivative of the partition of unity introduces 'errors', so that (\u03c6t , gt ) is\nnot torsion-free. The size of the torsion \u2207\u03c6t depends on the difference \u03c6\u0302t \u2212 \u03c60\nin the region where the partition of unity changes. On the patches T 3 \u00d7 X,\nsince ht \u2212 h = O(t4 r\u22124 ) and the partition of unity has nonzero derivative when\nr = O(1), we find that \u2207\u03c6t = O(t4 ). Similarly \u2207\u03c6t = O(t6 ) on the patches\nS 1 \u00d7 Y , and so \u2207\u03c6t = O(t4 ) on M .\nFor small t, the dominant contributions to the injectivity radius \u03b4(gt ) and\nRiemann curvature R(gt ) are made by those of the metrics ht on X and Y ,\nso we expect \u03b4(gt ) = O(t) and R(gt ) C 0 = O(t\u22122 ) by properties (a) and (b)\nabove. In this way we prove the following result [9, Th. 11.5.7], which gives the\nestimates on (\u03c6t , gt ) that we need.\nTheorem 2.3 On the compact 7-manifold M described above, and on many\nother 7-manifolds constructed in a similar fashion, one can write down the following data explicitly in coordinates:\n\u2022 Positive constants A1 , A2 , A3 and \u01eb,\n\u2022 A G2 -structure (\u03c6t , gt ) on M with d\u03c6t = 0 for each t \u2208 (0, \u01eb), and\n\u2022 A 3-form \u03c8t on M with d\u2217 \u03c8t = d\u2217 \u03c6t for each t \u2208 (0, \u01eb).\nThese satisfy three conditions:\n(i) k\u03c8t kL2 6 A1 t4 , k\u03c8t kC 0 6 A1 t3 and kd\u2217 \u03c8t kL14 6 A1 t16/7 ,\n(ii) the injectivity radius \u03b4(gt ) satisfies \u03b4(gt ) > A2 t,\n(iii) the Riemann curvature R(gt ) of gt satisfies R(gt )\n\nC0\n\n6 A3 t\u22122 .\n\nHere the operator d\u2217 and the norms k . kL2 , k . kL14 and k . kC 0 depend on gt .\nHere one should regard \u03c8t as a first integral of the torsion \u2207\u03c6t of (\u03c6t , gt ).\nThus the norms k\u03c8t kL2 , k\u03c8t kC 0 and kd\u2217 \u03c8t kL14 are measures of \u2207\u03c6t . So parts\n(i)\u2013(iii) say that the torsion \u2207\u03c6t must be small compared to the injectivity\nradius and Riemann curvature of (M, gt ).\n\n8\n\n\f2.4\n\nStep 4: Deforming to a torsion-free G2 -structure\n\nWe prove the following analysis result.\nTheorem 2.4 Let A1 , A2 , A3 be positive constants. Then there exist positive\nconstants \u03ba, K such that whenever 0 < t 6 \u03ba, the following is true.\nLet M be a compact 7-manifold, and (\u03c6, g) a G2 -structure on M with d\u03c6 = 0.\nSuppose \u03c8 is a smooth 3-form on M with d\u2217 \u03c8 = d\u2217 \u03c6, and\n(i) k\u03c8kL2 6 A1 t4 , k\u03c8kC 0 6 A1 t1/2 and kd\u2217 \u03c8kL14 6 A1 ,\n(ii) the injectivity radius \u03b4(g) satisfies \u03b4(g) > A2 t, and\n(iii) the Riemann curvature R(g) satisfies R(g)\n\nC0\n\n6 A3 t\u22122 .\n\nThen there exists a smooth, torsion-free G2 -structure (\u03c6\u0303, g\u0303) on M with k\u03c6\u0303 \u2212\n\u03c6kC 0 6 Kt1/2 .\nBasically, this result says that if (\u03c6, g) is a G2 -structure on M , and the\ntorsion \u2207\u03c6 is sufficiently small, then we can deform to a nearby G2 -structure\n(\u03c6\u0303, g\u0303) that is torsion-free. Here is a sketch of the proof of Theorem 2.4, ignoring\nseveral technical points. The proof is that given in [9, \u00a711.6\u2013\u00a711.8], which is an\nimproved version of the proof in [5].\nWe have a 3-form \u03c6 with d\u03c6 = 0 and d\u2217 \u03c6 = d\u2217 \u03c8 for small \u03c8, and we wish to\nconstruct a nearby 3-form \u03c6\u0303 with d\u03c6\u0303 = 0 and d\u0303\u2217 \u03c6\u0303 = 0. Set \u03c6\u0303 = \u03c6 + d\u03b7, where\n\u03b7 is a small 2-form. Then \u03b7 must satisfy a nonlinear p.d.e., which we write as\nd\u2217 d\u03b7 = \u2212d\u2217 \u03c8 + d\u2217 F (d\u03b7),\n(9)\n\u0001\nwhere F is nonlinear, satisfying F (d\u03b7) = O |d\u03b7|2 .\nWe solve (9) by iteration, introducing a sequence {\u03b7j }\u221e\nj=0 with \u03b70 = 0,\nsatisfying the inductive equations\nd\u2217 d\u03b7j+1 = \u2212d\u2217 \u03c8 + d\u2217 F (d\u03b7j ),\n\nd\u2217 \u03b7j+1 = 0.\n\n(10)\n\nIf such a sequence exists and converges to \u03b7, then taking the limit in (10) shows\nthat \u03b7 satisfies (9), giving us the solution we want.\nThe key to proving this is an inductive estimate on the sequence {\u03b7j }\u221e\nj=0 .\nThe inductive estimate we use has three ingredients, the equations\nkd\u03b7j+1 kL2 6 k\u03c8kL2 + C1 kd\u03b7j kL2 kd\u03b7j kC 0 ,\nk\u2207d\u03b7j+1 kL14 6 C2 kd \u03c8kL14 + k\u2207d\u03b7j kL14 kd\u03b7j kC 0 + t\n\u0001\nkd\u03b7j kC 0 6 C3 t1/2 k\u2207d\u03b7j kL14 + t\u22127/2 kd\u03b7j kL2 .\n\u2217\n\n(11)\n\u22124\n\n\u0001\nkd\u03b7j+1 kL2 ,\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\nHere C1 , C2 , C3 are positive constants independent of t. Equation (11) is obtained from (10) by taking the L2 -inner product with \u03b7j+1 and integrating by\nparts. Using the fact that d\u2217 \u03c6 = d\u2217 \u03c8 and k\u03c8kL2 = O(t4 ), |\u03c8| = O(t1/2 ) we get\na powerful estimate of the L2 -norm of d\u03b7j+1 .\nEquation (12) is derived from an elliptic regularity estimate for the operator\nd+d\u2217 acting on 3-forms on M . Equation (13) follows from the Sobolev embedding\n9\n\n\f0\ntheorem, since L14\n1 (M ) embeds in C (M ). Both (12) and (13) are proved on\nsmall balls of radius O(t) in M , using parts (ii) and (iii) of Theorem 2.3, and\nthis is where the powers of t come from.\nUsing (11)-(13) and part (i) of Theorem 2.3 we show that if\n\nkd\u03b7j kL2 6 C4 t4 , k\u2207d\u03b7j kL14 6 C5 , and kd\u03b7j kC 0 6 Kt1/2 ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere C4 , C5 and K are positive constants depending on C1 , C2 , C3 and A1 ,\nand if t is sufficiently small, then the same inequalities (14) apply to d\u03b7j+1 .\nSince \u03b70 = 0, by induction (14) applies for all j and the sequence {d\u03b7j }\u221e\nj=0\n3 \u2217\nis bounded in the Banach space L14\n1 (\u039b T M ). One can then use standard\ntechniques in analysis to prove that this sequence converges to a smooth limit\nd\u03b7. This concludes the proof of Theorem 2.4.\nFigure 1: Betti numbers (b2 , b3 ) of compact G2 -manifolds\n2\n\nb (M )\nq\n25\n20\n15\n\nq qqq\nq\nqq\nq q qqqqqq\nq qq qq qq\n\n10\n5\n\nq\nq q qq q\nq\nq q q\nq q qqq qq q q qq qq\nq\nq\nq qq qq qq q q qq q\nq\nq\nq\nq\nq q q\nq q qqq qq qqq qqq qqq q\nq\nq\nqq q q q qq qq qq qq qq q q q q\nq\nq q\nqq q qq qq qq qq qq q q q q q\nq q\nq\nq\nq\nqq q qq qq qq qq qq q qq q q q q q\nq q q\nq q q q q\nq qqq q q q q q qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq q q q q q q q q qqq qq qq q q q q qq q q q q q q q q q q q\nq q q q q q q q q q qq q qq qq qq qq q q q q q q\nq\n\n0\n0\n\nq\n\nb3 (M )\nq\n\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190 200 210\n\nFrom Theorems 2.3 and 2.4 we see that the compact 7-manifold M constructed in Step 2 admits torsion-free G2 -structures (\u03c6\u0303, g\u0303). Theorem 1.4 then\nshows that Hol(g\u0303) = G2 if and only if \u03c01 (M ) is finite. In the example above M\nis simply-connected, and so \u03c01 (M ) = {1} and M has metrics with holonomy\nG2 , as we want.\nBy considering different groups \u0393 acting on T 7 , and also by finding topologically distinct resolutions M1 , . . . , Mk of the same orbifold T 7 /\u0393, we can\nconstruct many compact Riemannian 7-manifolds with holonomy G2 . A good\nnumber of examples are given in [9, \u00a712]. Figure 1 displays the Betti numbers\nof compact, simply-connected 7-manifolds with holonomy G2 constructed there.\nThere are 252 different sets of Betti numbers.\nExamples are also known [9, \u00a712.4] of compact 7-manifolds with holonomy\nG2 with finite, nontrivial fundamental group. It seems likely to the author that\nthe Betti numbers given in Figure 1 are only a small proportion of the Betti\nnumbers of all compact, simply-connected 7-manifolds with holonomy G2 .\n\n10\n\n\f2.5\n\nOther constructions of compact G2 -manifolds\n\nHere are two other methods, taken from [9, \u00a711.9], that may be used to construct\ncompact 7-manifolds with holonomy G2 . The first method was outlined by the\nauthor in [6, \u00a74.3], and is being studied by the author's student Ben Stephens.\nMethod 1. Let (Y, J, h) be a Calabi\u2013Yau 3-fold, with K\u00e4hler form \u03c9 and\nholomorphic volume form \u03b8. Suppose \u03c3 : Y \u2192 Y is an involution, satisfying\n\u03c3 \u2217 (h) = h, \u03c3 \u2217 (J) = \u2212J and \u03c3 \u2217 (\u03b8) = \u03b8\u0304. We call \u03c3 a real structure on Y . Let N\nbe the fixed point set of \u03c3 in Y . Then N is a real 3-dimensional submanifold of\nY , and is in fact a special Lagrangian 3-fold.\nLet S 1 = R/Z, and define a torsion-free G2 -structure (\u03c6, g) on S 1 \u00d7 Y as in\nProposition 1.8. Then \u03c6 = dx \u2227 \u03c9 + Re \u03b8, where\nx \u2208 R/Z \u0001is the coordinate on\n\u0001\nS 1 . Define \u03c3\u0302 : S 1 \u00d7 Y \u2192 S 1 \u00d7 Y by \u03c3\u0302 (x, y) = \u2212x, \u03c3(y) . Then \u03c3\u0302 preserves\n(\u03c6, g) and \u03c3\u0302 2 = 1. The fixed points of \u03c3\u0302 in S 1 \u00d7 Y are {Z, 12 + Z} \u00d7 N . Thus\n(S 1 \u00d7 Y )/h\u03c3\u0302i is an orbifold. Its singular set is 2 copies of N , and each singular\npoint is modelled on R3 \u00d7 R4 /{\u00b11}.\nWe aim to resolve (S 1 \u00d7 Y )/h\u03c3\u0302i to get a compact 7-manifold M with holonomy G2 . Locally, each singular point should be resolved like R3 \u00d7 X, where X\nis an ALE Calabi\u2013Yau 2-fold asymptotic to C2 /{\u00b11}. There is a 3-dimensional\nfamily of such X, and we need to choose one member of this family for each\nsingular point in the singular set.\nCalculations by the author indicate that the data needed to do this is a\nclosed, coclosed 1-form \u03b1 on N that is nonzero at every point of N . The\nexistence of a suitable 1-form \u03b1 depends on the metric on N , which is the\nrestriction of the metric g on Y . But g comes from the solution of the Calabi\nConjecture, so we know little about it. This may make the method difficult to\napply in practice.\nThe second method is studied by Alexei Kovalev [12], and is based on an\nidea due to Simon Donaldson.\nMethod 2. Let X be a projective complex 3-fold with canonical bundle KX ,\n\u22121\nand s a holomorphic section of KX\nwhich vanishes to order 1 on a smooth\ndivisor D in X. Then D has trivial canonical bundle, so D is T 4 or K3. Suppose\nD is a K3 surface. Define Y = X \\ D, and suppose Y is simply-connected.\nThen Y is a noncompact complex 3-fold with KY trivial, and one infinite\nend modelled on D \u00d7 S 1 \u00d7 [0, \u221e). Using a version of the proof of the Calabi\nConjecture for noncompact manifolds one constructs a complete Calabi\u2013Yau\nmetric h on Y , which is asymptotic to the product on D \u00d7 S 1 \u00d7 [0, \u221e) of a\nCalabi\u2013Yau metric on D, and Euclidean metrics on S 1 and [0, \u221e). We call such\nmetrics Asymptotically Cylindrical.\nSuppose we have such a metric on Y . Define a torsion-free G2 -structure\n(\u03c6, g) on S 1 \u00d7 Y as in Proposition 1.8. Then S 1 \u00d7 Y is a noncompact G2 manifold with one end modelled on D \u00d7 T 2 \u00d7 [0, \u221e), whose metric is asymptotic\nto the product on D \u00d7 T 2 \u00d7 [0, \u221e) of a Calabi\u2013Yau metric on D, and Euclidean\nmetrics on T 2 and [0, \u221e).\n\n11\n\n\fDonaldson and Kovalev's idea is to take two such products S 1 \u00d7 Y1 and\nS \u00d7 Y2 whose infinite ends are isomorphic in a suitable way, and glue them\ntogether to get a compact 7-manifold M with holonomy G2 . The gluing process\nswaps round the S 1 factors. That is, the S 1 factor in S 1 \u00d7 Y1 is identified with\nthe asymptotic S 1 factor in Y2 \u223c D2 \u00d7 S 1 \u00d7 [0, \u221e), and vice versa.\n1\n\n3\n\nCompact Spin(7)-manifolds from Calabi\u2013Yau\n4-orbifolds\n\nIn a very similar way to the G2 case, one can construct examples of compact 8manifolds with holonomy Spin(7) by resolving the singularities of torus orbifolds\nT 8 /\u0393. This is done in [7] and [9, \u00a713\u2013\u00a714]. In [9, \u00a714], examples are constructed\nwhich realize 181 different sets of Betti numbers. Two compact 8-manifolds with\nholonomy Spin(7) and the same Betti numbers may be distinguished by the cup\nproducts on their cohomologies (examples of this are given in [7, \u00a73.4]), so they\nprobably represent rather more than 181 topologically distinct 8-manifolds.\nThe main differences with the G2 case are, firstly, that the technical details\nof the analysis are different and harder, and secondly, that the singularities that\narise are typically more complicated and more tricky to resolve. One reason for\nthis is that in the G2 case the singular set is made up of 1 and 3-dimensional\npieces in a 7-dimensional space, so one can often arrange for the pieces to avoid\neach other, and resolve them independently.\nBut in the Spin(7) case the singular set is typically made up of 4-dimensional\npieces in an 8-dimensional space, so they nearly always intersect. There are also\ntopological constraints arising from the \u00c2-genus, which do not apply in the G2\ncase. The moral appears to be that when you increase the dimension, things\nbecome more difficult.\nAnyway, we will not discuss this further, as the principles are very similar\nto the G2 case above. Instead, we will discuss an entirely different construction\nof compact 8-manifolds with holonomy Spin(7) developed by the author in [8]\nand [9, \u00a715], a little like Method 1 of \u00a72.5. In this we start from a Calabi\u2013Yau\n4-orbifold rather than from T 8 . The construction can be divided into five steps.\nStep 1. Find a compact, complex 4-orbifold (Y, J) satisfying the conditions:\n(a) Y has only finitely many singular points p1 , . . . , pk , for k > 1.\n(b) Y is modelled on C4 /hii near each pj , where i acts on C4 by\ncomplex multiplication.\n(c) There exists an antiholomorphic involution \u03c3 : Y \u2192 Y whose\nfixed point set is {p1 , . . . , pk }.\n(d) Y \\ {p1 , . . . , pk } is simply-connected, and h2,0 (Y ) = 0.\nStep 2. Choose a \u03c3-invariant K\u00e4hler class on Y . Then by Theorem 1.7 there\nexists a unique \u03c3-invariant Ricci-flat K\u00e4hler metric g in this K\u00e4hler\nclass. Let \u03c9 be the K\u00e4hler form of g. Let \u03b8 be a holomorphic volume\n\n12\n\n\fform for (Y, J, g). By multiplying \u03b8 by ei\u03c6 if necessary, we can arrange\nthat \u03c3 \u2217 (\u03b8) = \u03b8\u0304.\nDefine \u03a9 = 12 \u03c9\u2227\u03c9+Re \u03b8. Then (\u03a9, g) is a torsion-free Spin(7)-structure\non Y , by Proposition 1.10. Also, (\u03a9, g) is \u03c3-invariant, as \u03c3 \u2217 (\u03c9) = \u2212\u03c9\nand \u03c3 \u2217 (\u03b8) = \u03b8\u0304. Define Z = Y /h\u03c3i. Then Z is a compact real 8-orbifold\nwith isolated singular points p1 , . . . , pk , and (\u03a9, g) pushes down to a\ntorsion-free Spin(7)-structure (\u03a9, g) on Z.\nStep 3. Z is modelled on R8 /G near each pj , where G is a certain finite subgroup of Spin(7) with |G| = 8. We can write down two explicit, topologically distinct ALE Spin(7)-manifolds X1 , X2 asymptotic to R8 /G.\nEach carries a 1-parameter family of homothetic ALE metrics ht for\nt > 0 with Hol(ht ) = Z2 \u22c9 SU(4) \u2282 Spin(7).\nFor j = 1, . . . , k we choose ij = 1 or 2, and resolve the singularities of\nZ by gluing in Xij at the singular point pj for j = 1, . . . , k, to get a\ncompact, nonsingular 8-manifold M , with projection \u03c0 : M \u2192 Z.\nStep 4. On M , we explicitly write down a 1-parameter family of Spin(7)structures (\u03a9t , gt ) depending on t \u2208 (0, \u01eb). They are not torsion-free,\nbut have small torsion when t is small. As t \u2192 0, the Spin(7)-structure\n(\u03a9t , gt ) converges to the singular Spin(7)-structure \u03c0 \u2217 (\u03a90 , g0 ).\nStep 5. We prove using analysis that for sufficiently small t, the Spin(7)structure (\u03a9t , gt ) on M , with small torsion, can be deformed to a\nSpin(7)-structure (\u03a9\u0303t , g\u0303t ), with zero torsion.\nIt turns out that if ij = 1 for j = 1, . . . , k we have \u03c01 (M ) \u223c\n= Z2 and\nHol(g\u0303t ) = Z2 \u22c9 SU(4), and for the other 2k \u2212 1 choices of i1 , . . . , ik\nwe have \u03c01 (M ) = {1} and Hol(g\u0303t ) = Spin(7). So g\u0303t is a metric with\nholonomy Spin(7) on the compact 8-manifold M for (i1 , . . . , ik ) 6=\n(1, . . . , 1).\nOnce we have completed Step 1, Step 2 is immediate. Steps 4 and 5 are\nanalogous to Steps 3 and 4 of \u00a72, and can be done using the techniques and\nanalytic results developed by the author for the first T 8 /\u0393 construction of compact Spin(7)-manifolds, [7], [9, \u00a713]. So the really new material is in Steps 1\nand 3, and we will discuss only these.\n\n3.1\n\nStep 1: An example\n\nWe do Step 1 using complex algebraic geometry. The problem is that conditions\n(a)\u2013(d) above are very restrictive, so it is not that easy to find any Y satisfying\nall four conditions. All the examples Y the author has found are constructed\nusing weighted projective spaces, an important class of complex orbifolds.\nDefinition 3.1 Let m > 1 be an integer, and a0 , a1 , . . . , am positive integers with highest common factor 1. Let Cm+1 have complex coordinates on\n\n13\n\n\f(z0 , . . . , zm ), and define an action of the complex Lie group C\u2217 on Cm+1 by\nu\n\n(z0 , . . . , zm ) 7\u2212\u2192(ua0 z0 , . . . , uam zm ),\nThe weighted projective space CPm\na0 ,... ,am\n(z0 , . . . , zm ) is written [z0 , . . . , zm ].\n\nfor u \u2208 C\u2217 .\n\u0001\nis Cm+1 \\ {0} /C\u2217 . The C\u2217 -orbit of\n\nHere is the simplest example the author knows.\nExample 3.2 Let Y be the hypersurface of degree 12 in CP51,1,1,1,4,4 given by\n\b\nY = [z0 , . . . , z5 ] \u2208 CP51,1,1,1,4,4 : z012 + z112 + z212 + z312 + z43 + z53 = 0 .\nCalculation shows that Y has trivial canonical bundle and three singular points\np1 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, \u22121], p2 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, e\u03c0i/3] and p3 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, e\u2212\u03c0i/3], all\nmodelled on C4 /hii.\nNow define a map \u03c3 : Y \u2192 Y by\n\u03c3 : [z0 , . . . , z5 ] 7\u2212\u2192 [z\u03041 , \u2212z\u03040 , z\u03043 , \u2212z\u03042 , z\u03045 , z\u03044 ].\nNote that \u03c3 2 = 1, though this is not immediately obvious, because of the\ngeometry of CP51,1,1,1,4,4 . It can be shown that conditions (a)\u2013(d) of Step 1\nabove hold for Y and \u03c3.\nMore suitable 4-folds Y may be found by taking hypersurfaces or complete\nintersections in other weighted projective spaces, possibly also dividing by a\nfinite group, and then doing a crepant resolution to get rid of any singularities\nthat we don't want. Examples are given in [8], [9, \u00a715].\n\n3.2\n\nStep 3: Resolving R8 /G\n\nDefine \u03b1, \u03b2 : R8 \u2192 R8 by\n\u03b1 : (x1 , . . . , x8 ) 7\u2192 (\u2212x2 , x1 , \u2212x4 , x3 , \u2212x6 , x5 , \u2212x8 , x7 ),\n\u03b2 : (x1 , . . . , x8 ) 7\u2192 (x3 , \u2212x4 , \u2212x1 , x2 , x7 , \u2212x8 , \u2212x5 , x6 ).\nThen \u03b1, \u03b2 preserve \u03a90 given in (2), so they lie in Spin(7). Also \u03b14 = \u03b2 4 = 1,\n\u03b12 = \u03b2 2 and \u03b1\u03b2 = \u03b2\u03b13 . Let G = h\u03b1, \u03b2i. Then G is a finite nonabelian\nsubgroup of Spin(7) of order 8, which acts freely on R8 \\ {0}. One can show\nthat if Z is the compact Spin(7)-orbifold constructed in Step 2 above, then Tpj Z\nis isomorphic to R8 /G for j = 1, . . . , k, with an isomorphism identifying the\nSpin(7)-structures (\u03a9, g) on Z and (\u03a90 , g0 ) on R8 /G, such that \u03b2 corresponds\nto the \u03c3-action on Y .\nIn the next two examples we shall construct two different ALE Spin(7)manifolds (X1 , \u03a91 , g1 ) and (X2 , \u03a92 , g2 ) asymptotic to R8 /G.\nExample 3.3 Define complex coordinates (z1 , . . . , z4 ) on R8 by\n(z1 , z2 , z3 , z4 ) = (x1 + ix2 , x3 + ix4 , x5 + ix6 , x7 + ix8 ),\n14\n\n\fThen g0 = |dz1 |2 + * * *+ |dz4 |2 , and \u03a90 = 21 \u03c90 \u2227\u03c90 + Re(\u03b80 ), where \u03c90 and \u03b80 are\nthe usual K\u00e4hler form and complex volume form on C4 . In these coordinates,\n\u03b1 and \u03b2 are given by\n\u03b1 : (z1 , . . . , z4 ) 7\u2192 (iz1 , iz2 , iz3 , iz4 ),\n\u03b2 : (z1 , . . . , z4 ) 7\u2192 (z\u03042 , \u2212z\u03041 , z\u03044 , \u2212z\u03043 ).\n\n(15)\n\nNow C4 /h\u03b1i is a complex singularity, as \u03b1 \u2208 SU(4). Let (Y1 , \u03c01 ) be the\nblow-up of C4 /h\u03b1i at 0. Then Y1 is the unique crepant resolution of C4 /h\u03b1i.\nThe action of \u03b2 on C4 /h\u03b1i lifts to a free antiholomorphic map \u03b2 : Y1 \u2192 Y1 with\n\u03b2 2 = 1. Define X1 = Y1 /h\u03b2i. Then X1 is a nonsingular 8-manifold, and the\nprojection \u03c01 : Y1 \u2192 C4 /h\u03b1i pushes down to \u03c01 : X1 \u2192 R8 /G.\nThere exist ALE Calabi\u2013Yau metrics g1 on Y1 , which were written down\nexplicitly by Calabi [4, p. 285], and are invariant under the action of \u03b2 on Y1 .\nLet \u03c91 be the K\u00e4hler form of g1 , and \u03b81 = \u03c01\u2217 (\u03b80 ) the holomorphic volume\nform on Y1 . Define \u03a91 = 12 \u03c91 \u2227 \u03c91 + Re(\u03b81 ). Then (\u03a91 , g1 ) is a torsion-free\nSpin(7)-structure on Y1 , as in Proposition 1.10.\nAs \u03b2 \u2217 (\u03c91 ) = \u2212\u03c91 and \u03b2 \u2217 (\u03b81 ) = \u03b8\u03041 , we see that \u03b2 preserves (\u03a91 , g1 ). Thus\n(\u03a91 , g1 ) pushes down to a torsion-free Spin(7)-structure (\u03a91 , g1 ) on X1 . Then\n(X1 , \u03a91 , g1 ) is an ALE Spin(7)-manifold asymptotic to R8 /G.\nExample 3.4 Define new complex coordinates (w1 , . . . , w4 ) on R8 by\n(w1 , w2 , w3 , w4 ) = (\u2212x1 + ix3 , x2 + ix4 , \u2212x5 + ix7 , x6 + ix8 ).\nAgain we find that g0 = |dw1 |2 + * * * + |dw4 |2 and \u03a90 = 12 \u03c90 \u2227 \u03c90 + Re(\u03b80 ). In\nthese coordinates, \u03b1 and \u03b2 are given by\n\u03b1 : (w1 , . . . , w4 ) 7\u2192 (w\u03042 , \u2212w\u03041 , w\u03044 , \u2212w\u03043 ),\n\u03b2 : (w1 , . . . , w4 ) 7\u2192 (iw1 , iw2 , iw3 , iw4 ).\n\n(16)\n\nObserve that (15) and (16) are the same, except that the r\u00f4les of \u03b1, \u03b2 are\nreversed. Therefore we can use the ideas of Example 3.3 again.\nLet Y2 be the crepant resolution of C4 /h\u03b2i. The action of \u03b1 on C4 /h\u03b2i lifts to\na free antiholomorphic involution of Y2 . Let X2 = Y2 /h\u03b1i. Then X2 is nonsingular, and carries a torsion-free Spin(7)-structure (\u03a92 , g2 ), making (X2 , \u03a92 , g2 )\ninto an ALE Spin(7)-manifold asymptotic to R8 /G.\nWe can now explain the remarks on holonomy groups at the end of Step 5.\nThe holonomy groups Hol(gi ) of the metrics g1 , g2 in Examples 3.3 and 3.4 are\nboth isomorphic to Z2 \u22c9 SU(4), a subgroup of Spin(7). However, they are two\ndifferent inclusions of Z2 \u22c9 SU(4) in Spin(7), as in the first case the complex\nstructure is \u03b1 and in the second \u03b2.\nThe Spin(7)-structure (\u03a9, g) on Z also has holonomy Hol(g) = Z2 \u22c9 SU(4).\nUnder the natural identifications we have Hol(g1 ) = Hol(g) but Hol(g2 ) 6= Hol(g)\nas subgroups of Spin(7). Therefore, if we choose ij = 1 for all j = 1, . . . , k, then\nZ and Xij all have the same holonomy group Z2 \u22c9 SU(4), so they combine to\ngive metrics g\u0303t on M with Hol(g\u0303t ) = Z2 \u22c9 SU(4).\n15\n\n\fHowever, if ij = 2 for some j then the holonomy of g on Z and gij on Xij are\ndifferent Z2 \u22c9 SU(4) subgroups of Spin(7), which together generate the whole\ngroup Spin(7). Thus they combine to give metrics g\u0303t on M with Hol(g\u0303t ) =\nSpin(7).\n\n3.3\n\nConclusions\n\nThe author was able in [8] and [9, Ch. 15] to construct compact 8-manifolds with\nholonomy Spin(7) realizing 14 distinct sets of Betti numbers, which are given\nin Table 1. Probably there are many other examples which can be produced by\nsimilar methods.\nTable 1: Betti numbers (b2 , b3 , b4 ) of compact Spin(7)-manifolds\n(4, 33, 200)\n(1, 0, 908)\n(0, 0, 2446)\n\n(3, 33, 202)\n(0, 0, 910)\n(0, 6, 3730)\n\n(2, 33, 204)\n(1, 0, 1292)\n(0, 0, 4750)\n\n(1, 33, 206)\n(0, 0, 1294)\n(0, 0, 11 662)\n\n(0, 33, 208)\n(1, 0, 2444)\n\nComparing these Betti numbers with those of the compact 8-manifolds constructed in [9, Ch. 14] by resolving torus orbifolds T 8 /\u0393, we see that these\nexamples the middle Betti number b4 is much bigger, as much as 11 662 in one\ncase.\nGiven that the two constructions of compact 8-manifolds with holonomy\nSpin(7) that we know appear to produce sets of 8-manifolds with rather different\n'geography', it is tempting to speculate that the set of all compact 8-manifolds\nwith holonomy Spin(7) may be rather large, and that those constructed so far\nare a small sample with atypical behaviour.\n\nReferences\n[1] M.
