The unique capability of PIC codes to model\nsuch systems from first principles on macroscopic scales\nimplies that they can bridge the gap between theory and\nexperiment. For example, just a few years ago it was\nstill unclear if relativistic shocks exist. It was not known\nwhether the motion energy could be dissipated rapidly\nenough to sustain the shock discontinuity [1, 2]. Such\nshocks have not yet been observed directly, because they\ndo not exist in solar system plasma. Recent PIC simulations could shed light on how they develop in response to\nthe filamentation (Weibel) instability [3\u20135]. The particle\nacceleration and the generation of electromagnetic radiation within the context of active galactic nuclei [6\u20139],\nsupernova remnants [10, 11] or gamma ray bursts [12\u2013\n15] have also been investigated. PIC simulations are\nnow instrumental in investigating the plasma thermalization within solar flares [16, 17] and the dynamics of\nmagnetic reconnection [18, 19]. On a completely different length and density scale, the fast ignition scenario\nfor inertial confinement fusion [20] has prompted within\nthe last decades many numerical works focusing on the\npropagation of charged particle beams in a collisionless\nplasma [21, 22].\nCurrent simulations employ billions of computational\nparticles, placing physically realistic PIC simulations\nwithin our reach [23]. The inclusion of ions in PIC simulations nevertheless remains a formidable challenge. As\nlong as the system under scrutiny involves only electrons\nand positrons with the mass me , the time scale that must\nbe resolved is typically\nthe inverse electronic plasma fre\u221a\nquency \u03c9e\u22121 \u221d me . Running the simulation for hundreds or thousands \u03c9e\u22121 captures the evolution of the\n\nsystem way beyond its linear phase. Mobile protons or\nions in the simulation result in an additional and much\nlonger timescale. A PIC simulation must then resolve\np\nmany inverse proton plasma frequencies \u03c9p\u22121 \u221d\nMp\np\nand cover a time interval that is Fp = Mp /me \u223c 42\ntimes longer, if the plasma is unmagnetized and if protons are the only ion species. A further penalty is introduced by the larger spatial scales of the ion structures.\nThe size of the ion filaments is, for example, comparable\nto the ion skin depth c/\u03c9p , while that of the electron filaments is \u223c c/\u03c9e . In principle, the simulation box size\nthat is necessary to model electron-proton plasmas increases compared to that required by leptonic plasmas\nby a factor \u223c FpD , where D is the number of resolved\nspatial dimensions.\nFor this reason and until now, PIC simulations that use\nthe correct electron-to-proton mass ratio are restricted\nto 1D systems [8] and to 2D simulations that resolve a\nlimited spatio-temporal domain [24], while 2D PIC simulations that cover a large domain with regard to the\nion scales or even 3D PIC simulations normally resort\nto reduced ion masses between 10-100 electron masses\n[4, 25, 26]. Ion masses of up to 1000 electron masses\nhave been used in a 2.5D simulation [4] thanks to a low\nnumber of particles per cell, which is beneficial for the\nscalability of a domain-decomposed PIC code. Multidimensional plasma simulations that employ the correct\nmass ratio and capture the largest ion scales are possible, if the electron dynamics does not have to be resolved\naccurately. Implicit PIC schemes can dissipate away the\nenergy contained in the smallest scales in a form of Landau damping [27, 28]. The cell size can then be increased\nbeyond the plasma Debye length, without restricting the\nphysical accuracy of the large-scale dynamics. However,\nif both the electron and the ion dynamics must be resolved simultaneously, the implicit PIC codes are equally\n\n\f2\ncostly as the explicit ones. The speeding up of the plasma\nevolution through a reduced ion mass will remain a necessity in particular for 3D simulations. It is thus important to assess how the plasma dynamics changes with\nthis parameter.\nVarious studies exist that demonstrate the importance\nof the electron-to-ion mass ratio for the plasma dynamics\nin several types of plasma processes. Parametric studies\nof plasma shocks have addressed this issue both in the\nnon-relativistic [29\u201331] and relativistic [4] regimes. Simulation studies of the interplay between electron phase\nspace holes with the ions and its dependence on the mass\nratio can be found in [32, 33]. The impact of the mass\nratio on the reconnection of magnetic field lines and the\nassociated particle acceleration has been investigated in\nRef. [34, 35]. However, these studies related to the effects\nof a reduced ion mass focus primarily on the nonlinear\nevolution of the simulation.\nThis article is a first systematic study of the consequences of a reduced ion mass within a theoretical framework. The impact of the mass ratio on the nonlinear coupling of the plasma dynamics across the different scales is\nnot considered here; it is too complex and multifaceted.\nAn example would be the enlargement of the foreshock of\na perpendicular shock with an increasing ion mass, which\ninfluences the resulting instabilities and the thermalization of the shock-reflected ion beam [29\u201331, 36]. We\nstudy here the spectrum of linearly unstable waves, which\nshould depend on the mass ratio between the ions and the\nelectrons. Ions only one time \"heavier\" than electrons\nare obviously too light as they behave like positrons, not\nlike protons. Is it therefore possible to draw a line, from\nwhich ions will start being \"too light\" to represent protons?\nEven before answering this question, one could ask\nwhether the PIC simulation plasmas could be governed\nby some similarity laws involving the mass ratio. Similarity theory has been applied successfully in hydrodynamics. It allows us to predict certain properties of an object\nfrom experiments performed with its miniaturised model.\nWell-known cases of such experiments involve pumps,\nturbines or aircrafts [37, 38]. Similarity laws have also\nbeen derived for magnetic confinement fusion (see [39],\nand references therein) or relativistic laser-plasma interactions and laboratory astrophysics [40\u201342]. Similarity\nlaws would allow us to compensate a reduced mass ratio\nwith some other parameter, by which the computational\nefficiency can be altered.\nWe show in section 2 that it is not possible to derive an\nuniversal description of the growth rate spectrum, which\nis not explicitly dependent on the mass ratio. Section 3\nwill therefore aim at providing a restricted solution to the\nproblem. PIC simulations typically probe the long term\nnonlinear evolution of an unstable beam-plasma system.\nThe unstable spectrum usually contains more that one\nunstable mode, and these modes grow at different exponential rates. A hierarchy of unstable modes can be\nestablished in terms of their growth rate, and a crite-\n\nrion can be imposed on the mass ratio by demanding\nthat this hierarchy be preserved. The consequences of\nthis condition are then explicitly calculated for the case\nof a cold relativistic electron beam passing through a\nun-magnetized and cold plasma [43]. Section 4 is the\ndiscussion, which brings forward a possible explanation\nwhy the shock formation in Ref. [4] does apparently not\ndepend on the mass ratio.\nII.\n\nABSENCE OF A SIMILARITY LAW\n\nConsider a problem that involves n independent dimensional variables (x1 , . . . , xn ), and m fundamental dimensions such as meter, second, etc. The so-called Buckingham's method [44] to reduce the number of variables\nand to derive similarity laws is the following.\nIdentify the pairs of xi 's that share the same physical unit. If this is the case for the variables xk1 and\nxk2 , then replace (xk1 , xk2 ) by (xk1 , xk1 /xk2 ) in the list\nof variables. After iterating this process for any such\npairs, we are left with the modified set of variables\n(x1 , . . . , xm , xk1 /xk2 , . . . , xkl\u22121 /xkl ) where l + m = n.\nBuckingham's \"\u03a0 theorem\" then states that any unknown function of the form\nf (x1 , . . . , xm , xk1 /xk2 , . . . , xkl\u22121 /xkl ) = 0,\n\n(1)\n\ncan indeed be cast under the form,\n\u03c6(\u03c01 , . . . , \u03c0m\u2212p , xk1 /xk2 , . . . , xkl\u22121 /xkl ) = 0,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the variables \u03c0i are dimensionless products of the\ninitial xi 's, and p the number of fundamental dimensions\namong (x1 , . . . , xm ).\nConsider as a simple illustration a swinging pendulum with the mass M (kg) and the length l (m), which\noscillates with the constant period T (s) in a gravitational field g (m/s2 ). The first step of Buckingham's\nmethod, namely the pairing of variables that share the\nsame dimension, can be skipped here since all 4 variables\n(M, l, T, g) have different dimensions (kg, m, s, m/s2 ).\nWe thus have here m = 4 (4 variables) and only p = 3\n(kg, m, s) as g does not add any extra fundamental dimension to the problem.\nBuckingham's theorem states in this case that\nany function f (M, l, T, g) = 0 can be expressed as\n\u03c6(\u03c0m\u2212p=1 ) = 0, so that the problem is eventually a function of one single dimensionless parameter. A subsequent\ndimensional analysis shows that the universal parameter\nmust be a power of gT 2 /L. Clearly, the mass M cannot\nparticipate in the dimensionless parameter, because no\nother variables could cancel its physical unit. The period\nT is thus independent of the mass M and only a function of the ratio g/L. Note that the theorem does not\ndistinguish between \"input\" variables (what is known,\ne.g. M, l, g) and \"output\" variables (what is looked for,\ne.g. T ). Each quantity is treated in the same way and\nall contribute to m and to p.\n\n\f3\nTurning now to the present problem, we see from the\nfirst step of Buckingham's method that a similarity law\nwithout an explicit dependence on the mass ratio cannot exist. Whatever the list of variables describing the\nproblem may be, the mass parameters (me , Mp ) will be\na part of it. The first step of the process will just replace (me , Mp ) by (me , me /Mp ), and Buckingham's theorem reduces the number of variables left once all the\ndimensionless trivial ratios have been formed. At any\nrate, Buckingham's theorem states that the mass ratio\nremains as an explicit parameter in the final reduced set\nof parameters.\nThere is therefore no hope of unraveling similarity laws\nconnecting two systems (A) and (B) with different mass\nratios. A change of the mass ratio cannot be \"compensated\" by a shift of the other variables. Buckingham's\nanalysis of the problem proves an intuitively simple reasoning: electrons and ions define different time scales in\nterms of their respective mass. The time evolution of\nthe system can be normalized to any one of them, but\nit cannot fit both at the same time. Note that although\nthe rest of the article focuses on the linear regime of an\nelectron beam plasma system, the present conclusion is\nvery general, and valid for the overall evolution of any\nkind of system comprised of two species.\nLet us initially assume that the ions are immobile,\nyielding an electron-to-ion mass ratio of zero. Electrons\nare therefore the only population bringing a mass into the\nparameter list. The electron mass me will therefore appear among the x1 . . . xm in Eq. (1). Buckingham's theorem here states that these m dimensional variables can\nbe replaced by m \u2212 p dimensionless variables \u03c01 . . . \u03c0m\u2212p .\nBecause no mass ratio can appear among the l \u2212 1 ratios\nwhich are arguments of the function \u03c6 in Eq. (2), the underlying equations can not rely explicitly on the electron\nmass. Equation (2) shows that me must have been \"absorbed\" by one of the dimensionless \u03c0's. This is precisely\nwhat is observed when dealing with such questions: the\ntime parameter is frequently normalized to the electronic\nplasma frequency which includes the electron mass.\n\nIII. PRESERVING THE GROWTH RATE\nHIERARCHY OF THE UNSTABLE MODES\n\nIn ultra-relativistic laser-plasma interaction, similarity\ntheory states that laser-plasma interactions with different\na0 = eA0 /me c2 and ne /nc are similar, as soon as the\nsimilarity parameter S = ne /a0 nc is the same [42] (A0\nis the laser amplitude, ne is the plasma electron density,\nand nc = me \u03c902 /4\u03c0e2 is the critical density for a laser\nwith frequency \u03c90 .\nThe previous Buckingham analysis has demonstrated\nthat there cannot be any such similarity parameter in\nthe problem we consider here. As soon as the ions are\nallowed to move, the electron to ion mass ratio R must\nappears explicitly in any list of dimensionless parameters\ndescribing the system. Two systems differing only by\n\ntheir mass ratio will not evolve similarly.\nA deviation of the simulation dynamics from the true\nplasma dynamics is acceptable, as long the modifications\nare only quantitative. The simulation can in this case\nstill provide important qualitative insight into the plasma\nevolution, which can not be obtained by any other means.\nHowever, somewhere in between the mass ratio of 1/1836\nand the (positron) mass ratio of 1, a line must be crossed\nwhen even this is not the case any more.\nFor an unstable system with ratio R = mi /me between\nthe ion and the electron mass, the unstable spectrum\nS = {k \u2208 R3 / \u03b4(k, R) > 0} is comprised of all the modes\nwith wavenumbers k with an amplitude that grows at\nthe exponential (positive) growth rate \u03b4. Among these\nmodes, the most unstable mode km (R) defined by,\n\u03b4(km , R) = max{\u03b4(k, R)}k\u2208S \u2261 \u03b4m (R),\n\n(3)\n\nplays a peculiar role because it is the one which growth\ndetermines the outcome of the linear phase. The evolution of km , as a function of R, may be continuous, or\nnot. For clarity, let us consider the example studied in\nSec. III A, of a one dimensional beam-plasma system.\nThe dispersion equation in this case gives two kinds of\nunstable modes: the two-stream modes and the Buneman\nmodes. Let us assume that we have plasma parameters\nthat are such that the dominant mode km is a two-stream\nmode. It is possible to find a range of mass ratios R, for\nwhich the two-stream mode always grows fastest. In this\ncase, km evolves continuously with R. A variation of the\nmass ratio may trigger in another case a transition from\nthe two-stream regime to a Buneman regime where km\nis the wavenumber of a Buneman mode. Here, the evolution of km will be discontinuous and we will talk about\nan altered mode hierarchy.\nChanging the mass ratio in such a way that the mode\nhierarchy is altered will thus result in a different plasma\nevolution during the linear growth phase of the instabilities. In our 1D example, the typical size of the patterns\ngenerated in the early evolution will change abruptly by\na factor nb /ne , where nb,e are the beam and plasma electronic densities respectively. For the 2D system considered in Sec. III B, a switch from a two-stream to a filamentation regime results in the generation of magnetized\nfilaments instead of electrostatic stripes.\nAlthough we focus in what follows on a specific setup,\nmost kinds of beam-plasma systems encountered in the\nliterature also exhibit more than one type of unstable\nmodes [43, 45, 46].\nThe criterion we propose is that the modified mass ratio must not alter the mode hierarchy. Note that this is a\nnecessary but not a sufficient condition. If the mode hierarchy is altered, then the evolution of the system should\nbe affected as well. However, even a similar linear phase\ncould result in a different non-linear long-term evolution\nprompted by a different mass ratio.\nEven if thermal effects are neglected, the analysis of\nthe full spectrum of unstable waves is involved for energetic astrophysical plasmas [46]. The identification of the\n\n\f4\nfastest-growing wave mode requires the evaluation of the\nfull three-dimensional spectrum of wave vectors [43, 47\u2013\n49]. In what follows, the proposed criterion for the mass\nratio is applied to the simple and generic, yet important,\nsystem formed by a relativistic electron beam that passes\nthrough a plasma with an electronic return current. The\nreturn current initially cancels the beam current and the\nion charge density cancels the total electronic one. Since\nsome PIC simulations are still performed in a 1D geometry, we start by analyzing the 1D case before we turn to\nthe more realistic 2D and 3D ones.\nA.\n\n\u2206\n0.08\n\n0.06\n\n0.04\n\n0.02\n\n1\n\nRelativistic electron beam - 1D simulation\n\nWe consider a relativistic electron beam with the density nb , the velocity vb and the Lorentz factor \u03b3b =\n(1 \u2212 vb2 /c2 )\u22121/2 , which passes through a plasma with\nthe ion density ni and the electron density ne with\nni = nb + ne .

For the strictly symmetric case\nwith \u03b1 = 1, the return current becomes relativistic with\n\u03b3e = \u03b3b . The dispersion equation (6) defines two kinds of\nunstable modes [50]. The two-stream instability is driven\nby the two electron beams.

(6). Both wave branches share the same Z-interval\nif \u03b1 \u223c 1. Equations (7,8) show how the mode hierarchy\nrelies explicitly on the mass ratio. Only the growth rate\nof the Buneman modes scales like R1/3 . Changing the\nmass ratio can thus change the mode hierarchy.\nFigure 2 depicts the range of parameters (\u03b3b , \u03b1) where\ntwo-stream and Buneman modes govern the spectrum for\nvarious mass ratios R. The separatrix between the domain is plotted for R = 1/30, 1/100, 1/400 and 1/1836.\nThe Buneman modes grow faster below the curve, while\nthe two-stream modes are dominant above. The separatrix RM between the two domains is given by\nRm =\n\n\u03b1\n.\n\u03b3b3\n\n(9)\n\n\f5\nLet us assume that we run a 1D PIC simulation from\nthe parameters pictured by the circle labeled \"PIC1\".\nFor R = 1/1836, the corresponding system lies in the\ntwo-stream region. As we increase R, the growth rate\nof the Buneman instability increases relative to that of\nthe two-stream instability. For sufficiently light ions, the\nBuneman instability can even outgrow the two-stream\ninstability. Given some simulation parameters (\u03b3b , \u03b1),\nthe largest mass ratio that leaves the mode hierarchy unchanged is readily calculated from Eq. (9) if \u03b1 \u226a 1. One\ncan see that a mass ratio as high as 1/30 is allowed only\nfor weakly relativistic systems. If a PIC simulation uses\nthe parameter values denoted by \"PIC2\", the present criterion does not restrict the mass ratio. Any value larger\nthan 1/1836 would be in favor of the Buneman modes,\nwhich are already governing the system.\n\nB.\n\nFIG. 3. (Color online) Growth rate map as a function of\nZx , Zz . The parameters are the same as in Fig. 2. The beam\nvelocity vector points along the z axis.\n\nRelativistic electron beam - 2D and 3D\nsimulations\n\nThe previous reasoning is now expanded to a 2D geometry. It is equivalent to a full 3D geometry with regard\nto a linearized theory, as long as the system is cold and\ndoes not have two distinct symmetry axes. An example is a beam velocity vector vb that is not aligned with\nthe magnetic field direction. Here, the vb forms the sole\nsymmetry axis and it defines one direction. A second\ndimension takes into account the unstable modes with\nwave vectors that are not parallel to vb . These modes\ncompete with the two-stream and Buneman modes. One\nfinds the Weibel (or filamentation) modes for k \u22a5 vb ,\nwhich could play a major role in the magnetic field generation that is necessary to explain Gamma Ray Bursts\n[1, 51]. For obliquely oriented wave vectors, the so-called\n\"oblique modes\" are likely to govern parts of the relativistic regime [52].\nThe dispersion equation is more involved in 2D than in\n1D, because unstable modes are generally not longitudinal (i.e. electrostatic with k k E). While oblique unstable modes have been known to exist for some decades now\n[53\u201355], the first exact cold fluid analysis of the full unstable spectrum was only recently performed by Califano\net. al. [43]. The dielectric tensor is computed exactly\nfrom the Maxwell's equations, the continuity equation\nand the Euler equation for the three species involved.\nWe choose vb k z and a wave vector (kx , 0, kz ) in the\n(x, z) plane. The normalized wave vector Z from Eq. (5)\nis now extended to two dimensions,\nZ=\n\nkvb\n.\n\u03c9e\n\n(10)\n\nThe dielectric tensor has been computed symbolically using a Mathematica Notebook designed for this purpose\n[56]. The dispersion equation reads now\ndet(T ) = 0,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the tensor T is specified in the Appendix. The\ndispersion equation is an 8th degree polynomial. Its numerical solution is straightforward. Figure 3 shows a plot\nof the growth rate in terms of Z = (Zx , Zz ) for the same\nparameters as Fig. 1. The Weibel or filamentation modes\nare characterized by Zz = 0, the two-stream and Buneman modes by Zx = 0, while the oblique modes constitute the remaining spectrum. The ridge in the growth\nrate map at low Zz stems from the interaction of the two\nelectron beams, while the interaction of the ions with the\nbulk electrons is responsible for that at larger Zz 's.\n\nThe growth rates of the Weibel modes and of the\noblique modes can be estimated for immobile ions with\nR = 0 and for low \u03b1 as [55],\nr\n\u03b1\nWeibel : \u03b4W = \u03b2\n\u03b3b\n\u221a \u0012 \u00131/3\n3 \u03b1\n.\n(12)\nOblique : \u03b4O = 4/3\n\u03b3b\n2\nThese expressions must be corrected in a nontrivial way\nin the ultra-relativistic limit as \u03b1 approaches unity. Prior\nto the formulation of our criterion for the mass ratio\nR, we elucidate the hierarchy map and how it evolves\nwith R. Figure 4 pictures the separatrices of the domains in the parameter space for R = 1/1836 and for\nR = 1/30. Weibel modes tend to govern the high\nbeam density regime, and slightly expand the mildlyrelativistic (around \u03b3b = 20) part of their domain when\nR grows. Buneman modes modes govern the lower-right\ncorner of the graph, and being scaled like R1/3 , increase\ntheir domain as well with R. As a result, the domains\ngoverned by the oblique modes shrinks with a growing R.\nThe two-stream modes actually never govern the system,\nbecause they are outgrown by the oblique modes as soon\nas \u03b3b > 1.\n\n\f6\n\n\u03b1 (P T )\n\n1\nWeibel\n\n836\n\nR=\n1/\n\n30\n\nPIC2\n\n0,001\n\n0,01\n\n0,1\n\n0,001\n\n0,01\n\n0,1\n\n1000\n\n\u03b3 (P T )\n\nR=\n1/1\n\nOblique\n\n0,9\n0,8\n0,7\n0,6\n0,5\n0,4\n0,3\n0,2\n0,1\n0\n\nPIC1\n\n100\n\n10\n\nBun\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\nme/Mp\nFIG. 4.

This triple point is not likely to be important\nin astrophysical flows, since even the Lorentz factors of\nGRB jets do not reach such high values.

(Color online) Smallest inverse mass ratio value Rm\nleaving unchanged the 2D modes hierarchy for a given parameter set (\u03b3b , \u03b1) for 1/1836 < Rm < 1/30. The uniform white\nregion refers to configuration where the present criterion does\nnot constrain the mass ratio.\n\nWe now compute the largest R that leaves unchanged\nthe mode hierarchy for a given parameter set (\u03b3b , \u03b1), and\ndisplay the result on Fig. 6 (in fact, the smallest in\u22121\nis plotted, for better clarity). If,\nverse mass ratio Rm\nfor R = 1/1836, a system lies in the Buneman region,\nthen increasing R will not change the dominant mode.\nThe same holds for the systems pertaining initially to\nthe Weibel zone. But the system represented by \"PIC1\"\non Fig. 4 remains governed by the oblique modes only\nup to a certain value of the mass ratio, beyond which it\ngoes over into the Buneman domain. The same can be\nsaid for \"PIC2\": initially lying in the oblique domain, it\ngoes over into the Weibel domain beyond a critical value\nof the mass ratio. Only systems already located in the\noblique domain for R = 1/30 continue to do so as we alter\nR from 1/1836 to 1/30. Of course, we speak here only\n\nabout the lower part of the graph that corresponds to\nsmall values of \u03b1. The dominant mode depends through\nRm (\u03b3b , \u03b1) critically and in a nontrivial way on both, \u03b1\nand on \u03b3b in the upper part of Fig. 6.\nWe thus find a significantly extended region of the parameter space, namely, the uniform white domain on Fig.\n6, where the criterion that the mode hierarchy be unchanged does not restrict the value of the mass ratio. For\na system lying in this region, the dominant mode is the\nsame, regardless of whether R = 1/1836 or 1/30. In the\nlower-right corner (i.e., diluted ultra-relativistic beams),\nthe border is defined by the equality of the oblique mode\n(see Eq. 12) with the Buneman one for R = 1/1836,\n\u03b1 = R\u03b3b |R=1/1836 .\n\n(13)\n\n\f7\nIn the lower-left corner (i.e, diluted, weakly relativistic\nregime), the border is determined by equating the oblique\ngrowth rate with the Buneman one, but now for R =\n1/30,\n\u03b1 = R\u03b3b |R=1/30 .\n\n(14)\n\nThe upper-border of the uniform Weibel domain is analytically more intricate. Let us just mention that the\nparticular shape exhibited for \u03b3b \u223c 2 arises from the\nWeibel growth rate which reaches a maximum around\nthis value. Expression (12) for this quantity makes it\nclear that \u03b4W (vb = 0) = 0, while limvb \u2192c \u03b4W = 0. As a\nconsequence, \u03b4W reaches\n\u221a a maximum for an intermediate\nLorentz factor \u03b3b = 3, which is easily calculated from\nEq. (12). Although this value is not exact for \u03b1 close to\nunity and\n\u221a for R 6= 0, the \"Weibel optimum\" for \u03b3b stays\nclose to 3, explaining the \"bump\" at this location.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe importance of the electron to ion mass ratio R =\nme /mi for the realism of PIC simulations has been addressed here from an analytical point of view. Since there\ncannot be any rigorous similarity theory encompassing\nthis quantity, an attempt has been made to identify a\nthreshold Rm , beyond which a given simulation can no\nlonger be trusted to be physically accurate during the\ninitial exponential growth phase of the instability. This\ninitial wave growth can be addressed by a linearized theory.\nWhether it be relevant for astrophysical plasmas or for\ninertial fusion, many systems investigated through PIC\nsimulations give rise to the growth of waves that can be\naddressed by an analysis of the linear dispersion relation.\nThe idea is therefore to find the maximum value of R,\nwhich leaves unchanged the hierarchy of the linearly unstable modes. The condition we propose is necessary but\nnot sufficient: for the system evolution to be preserved,\nthe linear evolution and, more specifically, the type of\nthe fastest growing mode must remain unchanged as we\nchange R. However, two similar linear growth phases can\neventually result in a different non-linear state.\nBecause the application of the criterion depends on the\nlinear unstable spectrum, and therefore on the system\nunder scrutiny, we have focused on the generic system\nformed by a relativistic electron beam passing through\na plasma with return current. For a 1D simulation,\nthe competing modes are the two-stream mode and the\nBuneman mode (see Fig. 2). The criterion of the preserved mode hierarchy does provide a value of Rm , if the\nspectrum is governed by the two-stream instability for\nR = 1/1836. As a result, for example, the simulation\nof a 10 times diluted beam with \u03b3b = 2 cannot be performed with ions that have a mass below \u223c 100 times\nheavier than that of the electrons. For systems governed\nby the Buneman instability when R = 1/1836, our criterion does not give any upper value of Rm .\n\nThe 2/3D case is even more interesting as more modes\ncompete in the linear phase. Here, the Buneman, the\noblique and the Weibel instabilities can dominate the\nlinear phase, while the two-stream instability is unimportant for relativistic beam speeds. For R = 1/30 and\n1/1836, the hierarchy map is plotted on Fig. 3 in terms of\nthe density ratio \u03b1 and the beam Lorentz factor \u03b3b . One\ncan notice how the upper part (\u03b1 \u223c 1) does not vary with\nR. This could explain why PIC simulations of collisions\nbetween equally dense plasma shells did not show much\ndifference as the mass ratio has been altered [4]. The\ndominant mode is definitely the Weibel (filamentation)\none in this region. Things should be different when simulating collisions of shells with a different density, like in\n[57, 58], and varying the mass ratio.\nThe value of Rm in terms of (\u03b3b , \u03b1) is predictable at\nlow \u03b1, and more involved for \u03b1 \u223c 1 (see Fig. 6). A\nfew points can be emphasized at this junction: First, the\nmost sensitive points are the ones located near a border\nbetween two modes for R = 1/1836. When R departs\nfrom this value, the border moves, say from mode (A)\ndomain to mode (B) domain, so that (A) increases to\nthe expenses of (B). If the point was initially in the (A)\ndomain, it remains there and the criterion is not binding. But if the point was close to the border, yet in the\n(B) region, then a slight increase of R transfers it to the\n(A) region. This is why on Fig. 6, the white region of\nunconstrained R always borders Rm = 1/1836.\nSecond, some alteration of the mode hierarchy are\nmore dramatic than others. Figures 4 & 6 show that\n3 kinds of transitions can be triggered when increasing R: oblique to Buneman (OB - for diluted beam),\noblique to Weibel (OW - high density, weakly relativistic) and Buneman to Weibel (BW - high density,\nultra-relativistic). For diluted beams, the OB transition switches the wavelength of the dominant mode from\nZz \u223c 1 to 1/\u03b1, resulting in generated structures \u03b1 times\nsmaller. Furthermore, oblique modes generate partially\nelectromagnetic transverse structures whereas the electrostatic Buneman modes do not. More dramatic can\nbe the OW transition as we now switch from a quasielectrostatic dominant modes to an electromagnetic one.\nBut the BW transition is by far the most powerful as\nthe generated patterns switch from stripes (Buneman)\nto Filaments (Weibel).\nNote however that transitions are smoother than they\nappear because the switch from one mode regime to another is not immediate when a border is crossed. Suppose\nwe move from domain (A) to (B). As we approach the\nborder, mode (A) keeps growing faster, but mode (B)\ngrows almost as fast, until the growth rates are strictly\nequal right on the border. There is therefore a zone extending on both side on the line where a proper interpretation of the linear regime needs to account for the\ngrowth of (A) plus (B), thus smoothing out the transition.\nThe present article is a first step towards a systematic search. The method proposed has been applied to a\n\n\f8\ngeneric beam-plasma system, evidencing non-trivial values of Rm . A similar analysis can be easily conducted\nvarying the set-up: one needs first to evaluate the growthrate map (the counterpart of Fig. 3) as a function of k\nfor the system under scrutiny with R = 1/1836. The\nsame plot is then evaluated for the desired value of R. If\nthe dominant mode remains the same, then the present\ncriterion is met.\nFor example, when dealing with the problem of magnetic field amplification and particles acceleration in Supernova Remnants, a typical PIC setup consists in a nonrelativistic beam of protons passing through a plasma\nwith a guiding magnetic field [25, 59]. Due to the magnetization, unstable modes such as the Bell's ones [45]\nenrich the spectrum, and it would be interesting to apply our criterion also to these cases.\n\nAppendix A: 2D and 3D Tensor\n\nChoosing the axis z for the flow direction, and Z =\n(Zx , 0, Zz ), the tensor involved in the dispersion equation\n(11) is symmetric, and reads,\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\nT11 0 T31\nT = \uf8ed 0 T22 0 \uf8f8 ,\nT31 0 T33\nwhere,\n\nT22\nT33\n\n[1] J.
