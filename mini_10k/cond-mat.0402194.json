The Fano factor shows a clear reduction\non the 0.7 structure, and eventually vanishes upon applying a strong parallel magnetic field. These\nresults provide experimental evidence that the 0.7 structure is associated with two conduction\nchannels which have different transmission probabilities.\nPACS numbers: 72.70.+m, 73.23.Ad, 05.30.Fk\n\nStarting from a high mobility two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) the fabrication of split-gate devices\nhave allowed the study of one-dimensional (1D) ballistic transport. By applying a voltage Vg to the split-gate\nit is possible to control the number of transverse modes\ntransmitted through the 1D constriction created by the\nsplit-gate, and in wires typically shorter than 1 \u03bcm the\ndifferential conductance characteristics G(Vg ) = dI/dV\nexhibit[1, 2] plateaus quantized at integer multiples of\n2G0 , with G0 = e2 /h. The factor of two arises from the\nspin degeneracy of the 1D subbands in the constriction.\nIn addition to the quantized conductance plateaus, an\nunexpected structure is observed near 0.7\u00d72G0 . This feature, called the 0.7 structure, appeared but was not recognized in early work and subsequent investigations[3] of\nthe effect revealed its fundamental connection with electron spin. Although extensively studied[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],\none main question remains: Does the 0.7 structure correspond to a perfectly transmitted channel? Here, we give a\nclear experimental answer to this question by measuring\nthe Fano factor, F , of the partition noise of the current.\nFor conductances G \u2264 2G0 there are two conducting\nsubbands and to understand their role in the 0.7 structure it is easiest to consider them in a strong magnetic\nparallel field B, when they are spin-split (\u2191 and \u2193) and\nseparated by the Zeeman energy; the conductance characteristics G(Vg ) show plateaus at G0 and 2G0 . As B is\nreduced, measurements show [3] that the subband separation reduces linearly, and as B \u2192 0 there remains a\nfinite splitting. This finite splitting could be interpreted\nas a simple zero-field spin splitting, except that: (a) the\nlowest plateau is at 0.7 \u00d7 2G0 = 1.4G0 rather than at G0 ,\nand, (b) as the temperature is lowered the 0.7 structure\nweakens. Measurements of an enhanced g-factor as the\n1D subbands are depopulated, suggests the importance\nof exchange interactions [3]. Early calculations [9] show\n\nthat spin splitting of the subbands is possible, and a later\nphenomenological model[10] based on the effects of a dynamical local polarization in the constriction have had\nsome success in modelling the 0.7 structure, especially\nthe unusual temperature dependence. More recent microscopic mechanisms[7, 8, 11] are also based on the spin\ndegree of freedom. In many theoretical descriptions, the\n0.7 structure is compatible with there being two conduction channels with different transmission probabilities.\nTo date, there is no definitive proof that this is the case.\nPrevious noise measurements [12, 13] in the vicinity of\nthe 0.7 structure have included thermal noise contributions due to conductance non-linearities, as well as 1/f\nnoise. Furthermore, the explored energy range (several\nmeV) have exceeded the energy scale of the 0.7 structure\n[4]. Here, we present noise measurements at sub-Kelvin\ntemperatures, with a wide frequency range that allows\nus to separate the white noise and 1/f noise. Moreover,\na careful analysis of the non-linearities, which are intrinsic to the 0.7 anomaly [4, 8] , allows us to extract the\nthermal noise variations and to obtain the pure partition noise contribution. The deduced Fano factor shows\na reduction on the 0.7 structure. In addition, we have\nmeasured the evolution of the Fano factor with a parallel\nmagnetic field B; at high B the 0.7 structure moves to\nG0 and the Fano factor goes to zero.\nThe conductance and noise properties of a 1D conductor are well understood using the Landauer-B\u00fcttiker\n(LB) formalism, where a scattering matrix describes a\nnon-interacting system connected to reservoirs. LB theory predicts shot noise suppression for perfectly transmitted or reflected channels [14, 15, 16], which has been\nobserved experimentally [17, 18]. When conduction is linear (energy independent transmission probabilities), the\nFano factor is easy to extract as the ratio of the excess\nnoise \u2206SI (I) to the current I.

Before analyzing\nour results, we will outline how non-linearities and finite\ntemperature are incorporated into the LB formalism.\nOne considers two reservoirs (left and right) connected\nby n channels with energy-dependent transmission probabilities \u03c4n (\u01eb). The left and right reservoirs emit electrons at energy \u01eb with probabilities fl (\u01eb) = f (\u01eb + eV /2)\nand fr (\u01eb) = f (\u01eb \u2212 eV /2), where f (\u01eb) is the FermiDirac distribution.\nThe current through the sample is\nRP\nI = he\nn \u03c4n (\u01eb) [fl (\u01eb) \u2212 fr (\u01eb)] d\u01eb, and the differential\nconductance G is an average over kB T of the transmission probabilities at normalized energy \u00b1v,\nG=\n\nX1\ndI\n= G0\n[\u03c4n (v) + \u03c4n (\u2212v)] ,\ndV\n2\nn\n\n(1)\n\nwhere v = eV /2kB T . For energy independent transmission probabilities, we recoverP\nthe well known expression\nfor the conductance, G = G0 \u03c4n .\nThe current noise SI consists of two terms, SI =\nSI P art + SI T herm , the first term SI P art is due to partitioning, and the second term SI T herm results from the\nthermal noise of the current emitted by reservoirs. The\ntwo noise contributions are [16, 19]:\nZ X\nSI P art = 2G0 coth(v)\n\u03c4n (1 \u2212 \u03c4n ) [fl \u2212 fr ] d\u01eb,\nn\n\nSI\n\nT herm\n\n= 2G0\n\nZ X\n\n\u03c4n2\n\n[fl (1 \u2212 fl ) + fr (1 \u2212 fr )] d\u01eb.\n\nn\n\nFor energy independent \u03c4n , the two expressions become\nX\nSI P art = 2G0 coth(v)\n\u03c4n (1 \u2212 \u03c4n ) \u00d7 eV,\nn\n\nwhere F (0) is the Fano factor averaged over kB T\naround zero energy. This holds if the explored energy scale does not exceed a few kB T .\nThe excess noise \u2206SI is not proportional to SI P oiss , but\n\u2206SI = F (0)SI P oiss + \u2206SI T herm , where \u2206SI T herm =\nSI T herm (I) \u2212 SI T herm (0). Therefore excess noise measurements are not a direct measure of the Fano factor F ,\nbut also contain thermal noise variations. As G measures\nthe mean transmission over +v and \u2212v, it is not possible\nto know \u2206SI T herm ; however, we can estimate a lower\nbound assuming that the n different modes all have the\nsame transmission probability at zero bias\nh\ni\n2\n2\n\u2206SI T herm \u2265 4G0 kB T G\u0303(I) \u2212 G\u0303(0) /n,\n(5)\nwith G\u0303 = G/G0 . We will analyze the 0.7 structure assuming that there are two modes (n = 2 , G \u2264 2G0 ),\nwith equal transmission probabilities at zero bias. Therefore, the hcorrected noisei variations \u2206SI Corr = \u2206SI \u2212\n2\n2\n2G0 kB T G\u0303(I) \u2212 G\u0303(0) can be fitted with\n\u2206SI\n\nCorr\n\n= F + \u00d7 SI\n\nP oiss ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere F + is a fitting parameter. Later in this paper (see\nFig. 3) the measured linear dependence of \u2206SI Corr with\nSI P oiss validates the above assumptions and allows us to\nmeasure F + which, because thermal contributions have\nnot been fully taken into account, will be an upper bound\nof the real Fano factor F .\nThe split-gate device of length 0.4 \u03bcm and width\n0.5 \u03bcm was fabricated over a GaAs/GaAlAs heterostructure where the 2DEG is 3400 \u00c5 below the surface, and\nhas a density of 1.1 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22122 and a mobility of\n2.7 \u00d7 106 cm2 /Vs.

SI (I) is the physical noise\nof the 1D constriction we wish to obtain, and contains\nboth partition noise and thermal noise.\nFigure 2 shows \u2206SI (I, \u03bd) = SI (I, \u03bd) \u2212 SI (0, \u03bd) as\na function of the frequency \u03bd, at low frequency to reveal 1/f noise. The frequency dependence is fitted with\n\u2206SI (I, \u03bd) = S1/f (I) \u00d7 \u03bd \u03b1 + \u2206SI (I), where \u03b1, S1/f (I)\nand \u2206SI (I) are free parameters. In the low frequency\nrange, the fit is most sensitive to \u03b1 which is found to be\n\u03b1 = \u22121.007 \u00b1 0.005; this value does not change with current, temperature or the frequency range. We fix \u03b1 = \u22121;\nin the measured frequency range, 9.1 \u2212 15.5 kHz, an error\nof 0.005 in this exponent leads to an error of less than\n0.5% in \u2206SI (I). S1/f (I) is found to be roughly proportional to SI P oiss rather than to I 2 . The Fig. 2 inset\nshows the ratio S1/f (I)/SI P oiss as a function of the zero\nbias differential conductance G(V = 0). The amplitude\nof S1/f (I) falls to zero near the 0.7 structure because the\ntransconductance dG/dVg does the same. The reduction\nof the 1/f noise leads to an apparent noise reduction,\nwhich is not a suppression of the partition noise.\n\n\u2206 SI and \u2206 SI Corr (10\n\nof the sample being grounded. Four-terminal measurements are performed, and the voltage across the sample\nis amplified through two independent lines using two lownoise preamplifiers (NF Electronics LI75A) with a total\ngain of 1.042 \u00d7 104 . The cross-correlated voltage noise\n[18] SV (I, \u03bd) is measured with \u03bd in the 9.1 \u2212 15.5 kHz\nrange. By measuring the Johnson-Nyquist noise for temperatures in the range T = 200 \u2212 700 mK, the noise\naccuracy has been checked to within 1%. We define V as\nthe voltage across the constriction due to current biasing,\ntaking into account the series resistance.\nSimultaneous with the noise measurements, we measure the differential resistance R(Vg ) = dV /dI at 108 Hz\nwith a 0.1 nA rms excitation current. Figure 1(a) shows\nthe conductance, G(Vg ) = 1/(R(Vg ) \u2212 RS (B)), of the\nsample for different temperatures; the 0.7 structure is\nmore pronounced at higher temperatures, a hallmark of\nthis anomaly. A series resistance RS = 1730 \u03a9 was used\nto align the first quantized plateau at 2G0 . Figure 1(b)\nshows the G(Vg ) characteristics at T = 550 mK in different parallel magnetic fields B; as B approaches 8 Tesla\nthe 0.7 structure evolves into the spin-split plateau at G0 .\nThe series resistance RS (B) increases with B field, and\nfrom the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations of the 2DEG (at\nVg = 0) we estimate a misalignment of 4.15\u25e6 between the\nB field and the plane of the 2DEG. The measured perpendicular component of B is consistent with the RS (B)\nused to align the plateaus. At the maximum field (8\nTesla), the Landau level filling factor is 7.85 and we believe that this will not affect our findings.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n2.0\n\n7\n\nFrequency (kHz)\nFIG. 2: Typical current noise power spectrum variation as a\nfunction of the frequency for I = 10 nA.

The dotted line fit to the uncorrected\ndata \u2206SI gives an overestimated F + = 0.28. The dashed line\nfit to \u2206SI Corr gives F + = 0.17, an upper bound closer to F .\nThe inset shows G as a function of V .\n\nWith the 1/f noise characterized and subtracted, we\ndetermine the Fano factor using the corrected noise variation given in Eq. 6. For each determination, we measure\nthe noise at \u223c 500 mK by varying the bias current I from\n\u221210 nA to +10 nA in steps of 1 nA. The uncertainty in\n\u2206SI (I) is \u223c 10\u221229 A2 /Hz. Close to pinch off, there is a\nself-biasing effect due to the current, which leads to an\nasymmetry in the noise plot that disappears for smaller\ntransconductances. The Fano factor is determined using\nboth +I and \u2212I to counter this effect.\nFigure 3 shows both the raw excess noise \u2206SI (\u25e6) and\nthe corrected excess noise \u2206SI Corr (\u2022) on the 0.7 struc-\n\n\f4\nture at 460 mK with G(0) = 0.71\u00d72G0 . The uncorrected\nmeasurement \u2206SI gives an overestimated F + = 0.28,\nin apparent agreement with the Fano factor expected\nfor two channels with the same transmission probability (F \u2248 1 \u2212 0.71). However, if thermal corrections are\ntaken into account, the linear variation of \u2206SI Corr with\nSI P oiss gives F + = 0.17, much smaller than 0.29. There\nis a clear reduction of the Fano factor on the 0.7 structure\n[20]. The accuracy on F + is \u00b10.025, determined by both\nthe fit and by repetition of the measurement at fixed Vg .\nThe Fig. 3 inset shows the variation of the conductance\nwith the bias on the 0.7 structure.

As F + is below this line,\none can conclude that the two channels do not have the\nsame transmission on the 0.7 structure. Such information can only be obtained from simultaneous noise and\nconductance measurements. The upper bound Fano factors at B = 3 and 8 Tesla are plotted in Fig. 4 as squares\n(\u0003) and triangles (N), respectively. For both magnetic\nfields the suppression of the Fano factor is more developed than for B = 0 and the conductance at which the\nreduction occurs shifts towards G0 . This high B field\nresult is consistent with a Zeeman splitting of the \u2191 and\n\u2193 1D subbands. The evolution of the reduction with B\nindicates that the two channels having different transmissions at zero field may have different spin orientations.\nIn conclusion, we have performed careful measurements of the Fano factor which shows a clear reduction\non the 0.7 structure. This reduction demonstrates for the\nfirst time that the 0.7 structure is accompanied with two\nconducting channels with different transmission probabilities. The evolution of the reduction with a parallel\nmagnetic field B supports the picture of two channels\nwith different spin orientations. In future it would be\ninteresting to measure the evolution of the Fano factor\nreduction with temperature, in order to understand the\nunderlying mechanism which leads to these spin dependent transmissions.\n\n2.0\n\nZero bias conductance (G 0)\nFIG. 4: Upper bound of the Fano factor at T = 460 mK\nwithout thermal corrections (\u25e6), plotted versus the zero bias\nconductance. The solid circles (\u2022) show the same measurements as the open circles, but with thermal corrections applied. Squares (\u0003) show the Fano factor with thermal corrections at T = 610 mK and B = 3 Tesla, and the triangles (N)\nare similarly corrected data at T = 580 mK and B = 8 Tesla.\n\nFigure 4 presents the central result of our paper, where\nthe measured F + are plotted as a function of the zero bias\nconductance. The two solid lines in Fig. 4 show the expected F when there is full spin splitting (F \u2192 0 at G0\nand 2G0 ) or no spin splitting (F \u2192 0 at 2G0 ). The open\ncircles (\u25e6) are F + obtained when thermal corrections are\nnot taken into account; these data do not show a reduction at the 0.7 structure and follow the Fano factor for the\ncase of no spin splitting (the upper straight line). As explained previously, because the system is non-linear these\npoints are overestimated upper bounds of F . The solid\ncircles (\u2022) in Fig. 4 are obtained from the same data as\nthe open circles, but with the non-linearities taken into\naccount using Eq. 6; in contrast to the uncorrected data\nthere is a reduction close to the 0.7 structure. Whereas\none cannot calculate the transmission of the two modes\nfrom F + , one can show that they are not identical: we use\nthermal corrections assuming identical zero bias transmissions of the two channels, thus F + should be above\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n\nAlso at LPA, Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, Paris.\nNow at Physics, UNSW, Sydney 2052, Australia.\nB.
