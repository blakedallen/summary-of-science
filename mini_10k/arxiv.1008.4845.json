Danilenko and Mariusz Lema\u0144czyk\nAbstract. Let E be a subset of positive integers such that E \u2229{1, 2} 6= \u2205. A weakly\nmixing finite measure preserving flow T = (Tt )t\u2208R is constructed such that the set of\nspectral multiplicities (of the corresponding Koopman unitary representation generated by T ) is E. Moreover, for each non-zero t \u2208 R, the set of spectral multiplicities\nof the transformation Tt is also E. These results are partly extended to actions of\nsome other locally compact second countable Abelian groups.\n\n0. Introduction\nLet G be a locally compact second countable Abelian group and let T = (Tg )g\u2208G\nbe a measure preserving action of G on a standard probability space (X, B, \u03bc). The\nspectral theory of dynamical systems studies the corresponding Koopman unitary\nrepresentation UT = (UT (g))g\u2208G in the Hilbert space L20 (X, \u03bc) := L2 (X, \u03bc) \u2296 C\ngiven by\nUT (g)f := f \u25e6 T\u2212g\n(see [KaT]). Such a representation is completely characterized (up to unitary equivb and a spectral\nalence) by a measure of maximal spectral type on the dual group G\nb \u220b w \u2192 lT (w) \u2208 N \u222a {\u221e}. We denote by M(T ) the\nmultiplicity function lT : G\n(essential) image of lT .\nOne of the most appealing open problems in the spectral theory of dynamical\nsystems can be stated as follows: when a unitary representation is unitarily equivalent to a Koopman representation? Let us consider a weak version of this problem\nby replacing the unitary equivalence with another (weaker) equivalence relation on\nthe set of unitary representations of G. It was introduced in [Fr] for the unitary\nrepresentations of Z. Two unitary representations U and V of G in Hilbert spaces\nHU and HV respectively are called cyclicly isomorphic if there is a unitary operator\nW : HU \u2192 HV such that the image under W of each U -cyclic subspace in HU is\na V -cyclic subspace in HV and vise versa. Based on the proof in [Fr] for G = Z it\nis easy to see that if U and V have a continuous spectrum then they are cyclicly\nisomorphic if and only if M(U ) = M(V ). We thus come to the following natural\nquestion which is called the spectral multiplicity problem:\nwhich subsets E \u2282 N are realizable as E = M(T ) for an ergodic (or weakly\nmixing) free action T ?\nResearch of the second named author was partially supported by Polish MNiSzW grant N\nN201 384834.\n\n\fIn the case G = Z the spectral multiplicity problem was studied by a number\nof authors (see references in a recent survey [Le] and subsequent progress in [Ry2],\n[KaL], [Da3]). It is proved, in particular, that a subset E \u2282 N is realizable if one\nof the following is fulfilled: 1 \u2208 E, 2 \u2208 E or E = n * F for some n \u2265 2 and a\nsubset F \u2282 N with 1 \u2208 F . It is believed that every subset of N is realizable. In the\ncase G = Z2 , weakly mixing realizations of the subsets E \u220b 1 were constructed in\n[Fi] and weakly mixing realizations of subsets {2, 4, . . . , 2n }, for each n > 0, were\nshown in [Ko]. For a large class of Abelian locally compact second countable groups\nG including all countable groups and Rn , it was proved in [DaS] that there exist\nweakly mixing G-actions with homogeneous spectrum of arbitrary multiplicity.\nIn the present paper we mainly consider the case when G = R.\nTheorem 0.1 (Main theorem). Let E be a subset of positive integers such that\nE \u2229 {1, 2} =\n6 \u2205.\n(i) There is a weakly mixing finite measure preserving flow T = (Tt )t\u2208R such\nthat the set of spectral multiplicities of the Koopman unitary representation\ngenerated by T is E.\n(ii) For each non-zero t \u2208 R, the set of spectral multiplicities of the Koopman\noperator generated by the transformation Tt is also E.\nNow Theorem 0.1(i) can be interpreted in the following way: every unitary\nrepresentation of R with continuous spectrum and such that M(U ) \u2229 {1, 2} =\n6 \u2205 is\ncyclicly isomorphic to a Koopman representation of R. Secondly, given a subset E \u2282\nN such that E \u2229 {1, 2} =\n6 \u2205, denote by WE the set of weakly mixing transformations\nS with M(S) = E. As was mentioned above, the set WE is known to be nonempty. Theorem 0.1(ii) strengthens this fact: WE \u222a {Id} contains a one-parameter\nsubgroup.\nNow we make some remarks concerning the proof of Theorem 0.1. The simplest\nway to obtain flows with non-trivial spectral properties is to consider the suspensions of ergodic transformations with non-trivial spectral properties. We recall\nthat the suspensions are special flows constructed under the constant function 1.\nIn other words, they are R-actions induced by Z-actions. In Section 1 we briefly\nreview properties of induced actions in a more general setting of pairs (G, H), where\nG is a locally compact second countable Abelian group and H a closed co-compact\nsubgroup of G. Some of these properties were established in original papers by\nG. Mackey [Ma] and R. Zimmer [Zi]. By means of the inducing we can obtain\n\"cheaply\" a realization of each subset E \u2282 N containing 1 as the set of spectral\nmultiplicities of an ergodic flow. Unfortunately, the condition 1 \u2208 E is unavoidable within the class of suspension flows. Moreover, every suspension flow has a\nnon-trivial discrete spectrum. Therefore to construct weakly mixing realizations we\napply another approach. It is a continuous analogue of the realizations produced\nin [Da3]. The desired flows are compact group extensions of either rank-one flows\n(for realizations of sets E \u220b 1 in Section 4) or Cartesian squares of rank-one flows\n(for realizations of sets E \u220b 2 in Section 5). Sections 2 and 3 contain some preliminary material to understand the techniques used in Sections 4 and 5. In the\nfinal Section 6 we partly extend Theorem 0.1 to the actions of other non-compact\nAbelian groups: connected groups, groups without non-trivial compact subgroups,\ngroups containing a closed one-parameter subgroup, etc.\n2\n\n\f1. Induced actions\nLet G be a locally compact second countable Abelian group and H a co-compact\nsubgroup of G. Given a measure preserving action S = (Sh )h\u2208H of H on a standard\nprobability space (X, B, \u03bc), we denote by T = (Tg )g\u2208G the induced action of G on\nthe product space (G/H \u00d7 X, \u03bbG/H \u00d7 \u03bc), where \u03bbG/H is Haar measure on G/H\n(see [Ma], [Zi]). Fix a Borel cross-section s : G/H \u2192 G of the natural projection\nG \u2192 G/H such that s(H) = 0. Then\n(1-1)\n\nTg (y, x) := (gy, Sh(g,y)x),\n\nwhere h(g, y) := \u2212s(gy) + g + s(y) \u2208 H. Notice that the mapping h : G \u00d7 Y \u2192 H\nis a 1-cocycle, i.e.\nh(g1 g2 , y) = h(g1 , g2 y) + h(g2 , y)\nfor all y \u2208 Y , g1 , g2 \u2208 G. If S is ergodic then so is T . Denote by UT and US the\nKoopman representations of G and H generated by T and S respectively. Then\nUT is unitarily equivalent to the unitary representation of G induced by US [Ma].\nRecall that given a unitary representation V = (Vh )h\u2208H of H in a Hilbert space H,\nthe induced (by V ) representation U = (Ug )g\u2208G of G is defined on a Hilbert space\nL2 (G/H, \u03bbG/H ) \u2297 H by the formula\nU\u2212g f (y) := Vh(g,y) (f (gy)).\nHere we consider\nf \u2208 L2 (G/H, \u03bbG/H ) \u2297 H as a measurable function f : G/H \u2192 H\nR\nsuch that G/H kf (y)k2 d\u03bbG/H (y) < \u221e. In particular, under the above identification, if b \u2208 L2 (G/H, \u03bbG/H ) and a \u2208 H then for f (y) = (b \u2297 a)(y) = b(y)a and\nh \u2208 H we obtain\n(Uh f ) (y) = b(y)Vh (a) = (b \u2297 Vh a)(y).\nb\u2192H\nb stand for the natural projection. Denote by \u03c3U\nProposition 1.1. Let \u03c0 : G\nb\na measure of maximal spectral type of U on G.\n(i) \u03c3U \u25e6 \u03c0 \u22121 is a measure of maximal spectral type of V .\n(ii) U and V have the same set of spectral multiplicities.\nProof. Let M \u2282 N \u222a {\u221e} denote the set of spectral multiplicities of V . Then there\nL\nLi\nis a decomposition H = i\u2208M j=1 Hi,j of H such that\n\n\u2022 Hi,j is a cyclic space for V for every pair (i, j). Denote by \u03c3i,j a measure\nof the maximal spectral type for V \u21be Hi,j . Then\n\u2022 \u03c3i,j \u22a5 \u03c3i\u2032 ,j \u2032 if i 6= i\u2032 and\n\u2022 \u03c3i,j \u223c \u03c3i\u2032 ,j \u2032 if i = i\u2032 .\n\u2032\nIt is easy to see that L2 (G/H, \u03bbG/H ) \u2297 Hi,j is a cyclic space for U . Denote by \u03c3i,j\n2\na measure of the maximal spectral type of U \u21be (L (G/H, \u03bbG/H ) \u2297 Hi,j ). It is easy\nto see that\n(1-2)\n\n\u2032\n\u03c3i,j\n\u223c \u03c3i\u2032\u2032 ,j \u2032\n\nif i = i\u2032 .\n\nLet a \u2208 H be a cyclic vector for V such that the spectral measure of a is \u03c3V . Take\na unit vector b \u2208 L2 (G/H, \u03bbG/H ). Then for each h \u2208 H,\nhUh (b \u2297 a), b \u2297 ai = hVh a, ai\n3\n\n\fThis implies that \u03c0 projects the spectral measure of b \u2297 a into \u03c3V . This yields\n\u2032\n\u03c3i,j\n\u25e6 \u03c0 \u22121 = \u03c3i,j for each pair (i, j). Therefore\n\u2032\n\u03c3i,j\n\u22a5 \u03c3i\u2032\u2032 ,j \u2032\n\n(1-3)\n\nif i 6= i\u2032 .\n\nL\nLi\nSince L2 (G/H, \u03bbG/H ) \u2297 H = i\u2208M j=1 L2 (G/H, \u03bbG/H ) \u2297 Hi,j , we deduce both\n(i) and (ii) from (1-2) plus (1-3). \u0003\nIt follows that if a G-action T is induced by an H-action S then M(T ) =\nM(S) \u222a {1}. The \"extra\" value 1 appears because L20 (G/H, \u03bbG/H ) \u2297 1 is a UT cyclic subspace of L20 (G/H \u00d7 X, \u03bbG/H \u00d7 \u03bc).\nDenote by V an action of G on the homogeneous space G/H by translations.\nThe following proposition about induced actions was shown by R. Zimmer in [Zi].\nProposition 1.2.\n(i) Let T be an action of G on (X, B, \u03bc). Then the action of G induced by\nT \u21be H is isomorphic to the Cartesian product V \u00d7 T .\n(ii) An action T of G is induced by an action of H if and only if T has a factor\nisomorphic to V .\nRecall that given a dynamical system (Z, \u03bd, T ), a T \u00d7 T -invariant measure \u03c1 on\nthe product space Z \u00d7 Z such that the coordinate marginals of \u03c1 are both equal to\n\u03bd is called a (2-fold) self-joining of T . For the theory of joinings and notions like\nrelative weak mixing, relative compactness, simplicity and centralizer we refer the\nreader to [JuR] and [KaT].\nIn the following corollary we describe the structure of self-joinings of induced\nactions.\nProposition 1.3. Let T be a G-action induced by an ergodic H-action S (see (1-1)\nfor the notation). Let \u03c1 be an ergodic self-joining of T . Then (Y \u00d7X \u00d7Y \u00d7X, \u03c1, T \u00d7\nT ) is an induced G-action. More precisely, there are \u03ba \u2208 J2e (S) and g \u2208 G such\nthat\nZ\n\u03c1=\n\u03ba \u25e6 (Sh(s(y),y) \u00d7 Sh(s(y),gy)) \u00d7 \u03b4y \u00d7 \u03b4gy d\u03bbG/H (y).\nG/H\n\n\u03c1 is a graph of an isomorphism if and only if so is \u03ba. Hence two induced G-actions\nare isomorphic if and only if the underlying H-actions are isomorphic.\nProof. We use the notation from (1.1). The projection map Y \u00d7X \u2192 Y intertwines\nT with V (see (1.1)). Therefore the projection \u03c1\u2217 of \u03c1 to Y \u00d7 Y is an ergodic selfjoining of V . Hence there is g \u2208 G such that \u03c1\u2217 (A \u00d7 B) = \u03bbG/H (A \u00d7 gB) for all\nmeasurable subsets A, B \u2282 G/H.

Preliminaries\nWe start with an important algebraic lemma. Let G be a countable Abelian\ngroup, H a subgroup of G and v : G \u2192 G a group automorphism. We set\nL(G, H, v) := {#({v i (h) | i \u2208 Z} \u2229 H), h \u2208 H \\ {0}}.\nAlgebraic Lemma 2.1 ([KwL], [Da3]). Given any subset E \u2282 N, there exist a\ncountable Abelian group G, a subgroup H \u2282 G and an automorphism v : G \u2192 G\nsuch that\n(i) E = L(G, H, v) and\nb is countable and dense.\n(ii) the subgroup of vb-periodic points in G\n\nWe now recall the definition of rank one. Let S = (Sg )g\u2208Rd be a measure\npreserving action of Rd on a standard \u03c3-finite measure space (Y, C, \u03bd).\nDefinition 2.2.\n(i) A Rokhlin tower or column for S is a triple (A, f, F ), where A \u2208 C, F is\na cube in Rd and f : A \u2192 F is a measurable mapping such that for any\nBorel subset H \u2282 F and an element g \u2208 Rd with g + H \u2282 F , one has\nf \u22121 (g + H) = Sg f \u22121 (H).\n5\n\n\f(ii) S is said to be of rank one (by cubes) if there exists a sequence of Rokhlin\ntowers (An , fn , Fn ) such that the volume of Fn goes to infinity and for any\nsubset C \u2208 C of finite measure, there is a sequence of Borel subsets Hn \u2282 Fn\nsuch that\nlim \u03bd(C\u25b3fn\u22121 (Hn )) = 0.\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nDenote by R \u2282 X \u00d7 X the T -orbit equivalence relation. A Borel map \u03b1 from R\nto a compact group K is called a cocycle of R if\n\u03b1(x, y) + \u03b1(y, z) = \u03b1(x, z) for all (x, y), (y, z) \u2208 R.\nTwo cocycles \u03b1, \u03b2 : R \u2192 K are cohomologous if there is a \u03bc-conull subset B \u2282 X\nsuch that\n\u03b1(x, y) = \u03c6(x) + \u03b2(x, y) \u2212 \u03c6(y)\n\nfor all (x, y) \u2208 R \u2229 (B \u00d7 B).\n\nfor a Borel map \u03c6 : X \u2192 K.

The important cohomology\nequation on \u03b1 mentioned in Section 0 can now be stated as follows\n(2-1)\n\n\u03b1 \u25e6 S is cohomologous to v \u25e6 \u03b1\n\nfor some S \u2208 C(T ) and a group automorphism v : K \u2192 K.\n3. (C, F )-flows and (C, F )-cocycles\nTo prove Main Theorem we will use the (C, F )-construction (see [Da1] and references therein). We now briefly outline its formalism. Let two sequences (Cn )n>0\nand (Fn )n\u22650 of subsets in R be given such that:\n- Fn = [0, hn ), h0 = 1,\n- Cn is finite, #Cn > 1, min Cn = 0,\n- Fn + Cn+1 \u2282 [0, hn+1 \u2212 1),\n- (Fn + c) \u2229 (Fn + c\u2032 ) = \u2205 if c 6= c\u2032 , c, c\u2032 \u2208 Cn+1 ,\nn\n- limn\u2192\u221e #C1h***#C\n< \u221e.\nn\n6\n\n\fLet Xn := Fn \u00d7 Cn+1 \u00d7 Cn+2 \u00d7 * * * . Endow this set with the standard product\nBorel structure. The following map\n(fn , cn+1 , cn+2 ) 7\u2192 (fn + cn+1 , cn+2 , . . . )\nS\nis a Borel embedding of Xn into Xn+1 . We now set X := n\u22650 Xn and endow it\nwith the inductive limit standard Borel structure. Given a Borel subset A \u2282 Fn ,\nwe denote by [A]n the following cylinder: {x = (f, cn+1 , . . . , ) \u2208 Xn | f \u2208 A}. The\nfamily of all cylinders generates the entire \u03c3-algebra B on X.\nLet R stand for the tail equivalence relation on X: two points x, x\u2032 \u2208 X are Requivalent if there is n > 0 such that x = (fn , cn+1 , . . . ), x\u2032 = (fn\u2032 , c\u2032n+1 , . . . ) \u2208 Xn\nand cm = c\u2032m for all m > n. Of course, R is a Borel subset of X \u00d7 X. It is easy to\nsee that there is only one probability (non-atomic) Borel measure \u03bc on X which is\ninvariant under R. This means that every Borel isomorphism of X whose graph is\na subset of R preserves \u03bc. We note that the restriction of \u03bc on Xn is an infinite\nproduct \u03bdn \u00d7 \u03ban+1 \u00d7 \u03ban+2 \u00d7 * * * , where \u03bai is the equidistribution on Ci and \u03bdn+1 is\na measure proportional to \u03bbR \u21be Fn . Hence for each n \u2265 0 and a subset A \u2282 Fn ,\n\u03bc([A]n )/\u03bc(Xn ) = \u03bbR (A)/hn .\ne \u2282 X such that\nWe now isolate a subset X\ne \u2229 Xn := {x = (fn , cn+1 , cn+2 , . . . ) \u2208 Xn | ck 6= 0 infinitely often}.\nX\n\ne = 1. Now we define a Borel flow T =\nThen Xn is Borel, R-saturated and \u03bc(X)\ne by setting\n(Tt )t\u2208R on X\nTt (fn , cn+1 , . . . ) := (t + fn , cn+1 , . . . ) whenever t + fn < hn , n > 0.\n\ne When n \u2192 \u221e, Tt extends to the entire X.\ne It is\nThis formula defines Tt partly on X.\ne \u00d7R \u220b (x, t) 7\u2192 Tt x \u2208 X\ne is Borel and Tt Tt = Tt +t\neasy to see that the mapping X\n1\n2\n1\n2\ne\nfor all t1 , t2 \u2208 R. Moreover, the T -orbit equivalence relation coincides with R \u21be X.\nIt follows that T is \u03bc-preserving. In what follows we do not distinguish objects\n(sets, transformations, etc.) if they agree a.e. That is why we consider that T is\ndefined on the entire X.\nDefinition 3.1. We call T the (C, F )-flow associated with (Cn+1 , Fn )n\u22650 .\nIt is easy to see that T is of rank one. Hence it is free and ergodic.\nWe recall a concept of (C, F )-cocycle (see [Da2]). From now on, the group K is\nassumed Abelian. Given a sequence of maps \u03b1n : Cn \u2192 K, n = 1, 2, . . . , we first\ndefine a Borel cocycle \u03b1 : R \u2229 (X0 \u00d7 X0 ) \u2192 K by setting\nX\n\u03b1(x, x\u2032 ) :=\n(\u03b1n (cn ) \u2212 \u03b1n (c\u2032n )),\nn>0\n\nwhenever x = (0, c1 , c2 , . . . ) \u2208 X0 , x\u2032 = (0, c\u20321 , c\u20322 , . . . ) \u2208 X0 and (x, x\u2032 ) \u2208 R. To\nextend \u03b1 to the entire R, we first define a map \u03c0 : X \u2192 X0 as follows. Given x \u2208 X,\nlet n be the least positive integer such that x \u2208 Xn . Then x = (fn , cn+1 , . . . ) \u2208 Xn .\nWe set\n\u03c0(x) := ( 0, . . . , 0 , cn+1 , cn+2 , . . . ) \u2208 X0 .\n| {z }\nn+1 times\n\nOf course, (x, \u03c0(x)) \u2208 R. Now for each pair (x, y) \u2208 R, we let\n\u03b1(x, y) := \u03b1(\u03c0(x), \u03c0(y)).\n\nIt is easy to verify that \u03b1 is a well defined cocycle of R with values in K.\n7\n\n\fDefinition 3.2. We call \u03b1 the (C, F )-cocycle associated with (\u03b1n )\u221e\nn=1 .\nSuppose we have an invertible measure preserving transformation S of (X, \u03bc)\nsuch that S maps bijectively R(x) on R(Sx) for \u03bc-a.a. x \u2208 X. (This condition\nholds, for instance, if S \u2208 C(T ).) Then for each cocycle \u03b1 : R \u2192 K, we can define\na cocycle \u03b1 \u25e6 S by setting\n\u03b1 \u25e6 S(x, y) := \u03b1(Sx, Sy),\n\n(x, y) \u2208 R.\n\nAdapting the argument from [Da2, Section 4] we obtain the following lemma.\nLemma 3.3.

Realization of sets containing 1 as spectral multiplicities\nLet E be a subset of positive integers.

We first verify that T \u03b1 is weakly mixing. Let UT \u03b1 (t)f =\nexp (i\u03bbt)f for some f \u2208 L2 (X \u00d7K), f 6= 0 and \u03bb \u2208 R. It follows from Lemma 4.2(ii)\nthat\nUT \u03b1 (hn ) \u2192 0.5(I + UT \u03b1 (\u2212\u03bej ))\nand hence\nexp(ihn \u03bb) \u2192 0.5(1 + exp(\u2212i\u03bb\u03bej ))\nas Wj \u2212 1 \u220b n \u2192 \u221e, j = 1, 2. Therefore |1 + exp(\u2212i\u03bb\u03bej )| = 2 which implies\nexp(\u2212i\u03bb\u03bej ) = 1 for j = 1, 2. Since \u03be1 and \u03be2 are rationally independent, \u03bb = 0. It\nremains to show that T \u03b1 is ergodic. If \u03c7 6= 1 then there is a \u2208 K with l\u03c7 (a) 6= 1. If\nf \u2208 L2 (X, \u03bc) is invariant under UT \u03b1 ,\u03c7 then Lemma 4.2(i) yields f = l\u03c7 (a)f . Hence\nf = 0. If \u03c7 = 1 then UT \u03b1 ,\u03c7 = UT . Since T is ergodic, each UT \u03b1 ,\u03c7 -invariant function\nis constant. Thus, we have shown that UT \u03b1 is weakly mixing. Hence UT \u03b1,H is also\nweakly mixing.\nTo show that M(T \u03b1,H ) = E \u222a {1} we consider a natural decomposition of UT \u03b1,H\ninto an orthogonal sum\nM\nUT \u03b1,H =\nUT \u03b1 ,\u03c7 .\n[\n\u03c7\u2208K/H\n\nIt is enough to prove the following:\n(a) UT \u03b1 ,\u03c7 has a simple spectrum for each \u03c7,\n10\n\n\f(b) UT \u03b1 ,\u03c7 and UT \u03b1 ,\u03be are unitarily equivalent if \u03c7 and \u03be belong to the same\nvb-orbit,\n(c) the measures of maximal spectral type of UT,\u03c7 and UT,\u03be are mutually singular if \u03c7 and \u03be belong to different vb-orbits.\n\nFor each \u01eb > 0 and n > 0, there are a partition of Fn into intervals \u22060 , . . . , \u2206Mn\nand reals t1 , . . . , tMn such that maxj diam \u2206j < \u01eb, \u2206j = Ttj \u22060 and the mapping\n[\u2206j ]n \u220b x 7\u2192 \u03b1(T\u2212tj x, x) \u2208 K is constant for each 1 \u2264 j \u2264 Mn . This implies (a).\nIt is straightforward that (4-1) implies (b).\nIf \u03c7 and \u03b7 are non-equivalent then there is a \u2208 K such that l\u03c7 (a) 6= l\u03b7 (a). Morehn\nhn\nover, UT,\u03c7\n\u2192 l\u03c7 (a)I and UT,\u03b7\n\u2192 l\u03b7 (a)I as Na \u2212 1 \u220b n \u2192 \u221e by Lemma 4.2(i).\nHence the measures of maximal spectral types of UT,\u03b7 and UT,\u03c7 are mutually singular. Thus (c) holds. \u0003\nNow we are going to show the following claim.\nProposition 4.3. M(Tt ) = E for each t 6= 0.\nFor that we need an auxiliary statement from [LeP]. Given a Borel measure \u03c3\non R, we let A\u03c3 := {t \u2208 R | \u03c3 \u2217 \u03b4t 6\u22a5 \u03c3}.\nLemma 4.4([LeP]). Let \u03c3 be a finite Borel measure on R. If there are an analytic\nb such that \u03ben \u2192 \u221e\nfunction a on R and a sequence of continuous characters \u03ben \u2208 R\n2\nb and \u03ben \u2192 a weakly in L (R, \u03c3) then for each t0 \u2208 A\u03c3 there exists c \u2208 C with\nin R\n|c| = 1 and a(t + t0 ) = ca(t) for each t \u2208 R.\nProof of Proposition 4.3. Denote by \u03c3T a probability measure of maximal spectral\ntype for T . We first show that A\u03c3T = {0}. It follows from Lemma 4.2(ii) that\nUT \u03b1,H (hn ) \u2192 0.5(I + UT \u03b1,H (\u2212\u03bej ))\nweakly as Wj \u2212 1 \u220b n \u2192 \u221e, j = 1, 2. We deduce from this and Lemma 4.4 that for\neach t0 \u2208 A\u03c3T and j = 1, 2, there exists a complex number cj such that\n1 + exp(2\u03c0i\u03bej (t + t0 )) = cj (1 + exp(2\u03c0i\u03bej t))\nfor all t \u2208 R. This yields cj = 1 and exp(2\u03c0i\u03bej t0 ) = 1 for j = 1, 2. Since \u03be1 and \u03be2\nare rationally independent, t0 = 0.\nThus if 0 6= t \u2208 R then \u03c3T \u2217 \u03b4t \u22a5 \u03c3T . Hence the natural projection R \u2192\nR/tZ is one-to-one on a subset of full \u03c3T -measure. This implies that M(T \u03b1,H ) =\nM(Tt\u03b1,H ). \u0003\n5. Realization of sets containing 2 as spectral multiplicities\nNow let E be a subset of N such that 1 6\u2208 E. In this section we will realize the\nset E \u222a {2}. We first prove a couple of auxiliary lemmata.\nLemma 5.1. Let T be a weakly mixing flow with a simple spectrum. Let \u03be1 , \u03be2\nbe two rationally independent reals. Suppose that the weak closure WC(UT ) of the\ngroup {UT (t) | t \u2208 R} contains the following operators:\n(5-1)\n\n0.5(I + UT (j\u03be1 )),\n\n0.5(I + UT (\u03be2 ))\n11\n\nand\n\n0.5(I + UT (\u03be2 \u2212 \u03be1 )),\n\n\fj = 1, 2. Then the product flow T \u00d7 T := (Tt \u00d7 Tt )t\u2208R has a homogeneous spectrum\nof multiplicity 2 in the orthocomplement to the constants.\nProof. Let h be a cyclic vector for UT . Denote by C the closure of the span of 3\nvectors h \u2297 h, UT (\u03be1 )h \u2297 h and UT (\u03be2 )h \u2297 h. It follows from (5-1) that C is invariant\nunder the following operators:\n(5-2)\n\nUT (j\u03be1 ) \u2297 I + I \u2297 UT (j\u03be1 ),\n\n(5-3)\n\nUT (\u03be2 ) \u2297 I + I \u2297 UT (\u03be2 ),\n\n(5-4)\n\nUT (\u03be2 \u2212 \u03be1 ) \u2297 I + I \u2297 UT (\u03be2 \u2212 \u03be1 ).\n\nj = 1, 2,\n\nSlightly modifying the argument from [Ag] and [Ry1], we deduce from (5-2) and\n(5-3) that\nUT (n\u03be1 )h \u2297 h \u2208 C and UT (n\u03be2 )h \u2297 h \u2208 C\nfor all n \u2208 Z. Applying (5-4) to U (\u03be1 )h \u2297 h we obtain that UT (2\u03be1 \u2212 \u03be2 )h \u2297 h \u2208 C.\nApplying (5-2) with j = \u22122 step by step infinitely many times and then with\nj = 2 infinitely many times we obtain that U (2n\u03be1 \u2212 \u03be2 )h \u2297 h \u2208 C for each n \u2208\nZ. Next, applying (5-3) to U (2\u03be1 \u2212 \u03be2 )h \u2297 h, we deduce that U (2\u03be1 \u2212 2\u03be2 ) \u2208 C.\nThen again apply infinitely many times (5-2) with j = \u22122 and j = 2 to obtain\nU (2n\u03be1 \u2212 2\u03be2 )h \u2297 h \u2208 C. And so on. Finally, we obtain that\nU (2n\u03be1 + m\u03be2 )h \u2297 h \u2208 C\n\nfor all n, m \u2208 Z.\n\nHence U (t)h \u2297 h \u2208 C for all t \u2208 R. Since h is cyclic for U , it follows that H \u2297 h \u2282 C\nand therefore C = H \u2297 H.\nDenote by m the spectral multiplicity function for (Tt \u00d7 Tt )t\u2208R and denote by \u03c3\nthe measure of maximal spectral type for T . By the above, m(\u03bb) \u2264 3 for \u03c3 \u2217 \u03c3-a.a.\n\u03bb \u2208 R.\nR\nOn the other hand, since T is weakly mixing and \u03c3 \u00d7 \u03c3 = R \u03c3\u03bb d\u03c3 \u2217 \u03c3(\u03bb) and\n\u03c3\u03bb is invariant under the flip mapping R2 \u220b (y, z) 7\u2192 (z, y) \u2208 R2 , it follows that\nm(\u03bb) \u2208 {2, 4, . . . } \u222a {\u221e}. Hence m(\u03bb) = 2 a.e. \u0003\nLemma 5.2. Let U and V be unitary representations of R with simple spectrum.\nAssume that there are sequences an \u2192 \u221e, bn \u2192 \u221e a\u2032n \u2192 \u221e and b\u2032n \u2192 \u221e such that\n(i) U (an ) \u2192 0.5(I + U (\u03be)) and V (an ) \u2192 0.5(I + V (\u03be)),\n(ii) U (bn ) \u2192 0.5(dI + U (\u03be)) and V (bn ) \u2192 0.5(eI + V (\u03be)),\n(iii) U (a\u2032n ) \u2192 0.5(I + U (\u03b7)) and V (a\u2032n ) \u2192 0.5(I + V (\u03b7)) and\n(iv) U (b\u2032n ) \u2192 0.5(d\u2032 I + U (\u03b7)) and V (b\u2032n ) \u2192 0.5(e\u2032 I + V (\u03b7))\nfor some \u03be, \u03b7, d, e, d\u2032, e\u2032 \u2208 R. If d 6= e, d\u2032 6= e\u2032 and \u03be and \u03b7 are rationally independent\nthen U \u2297 V has also a simple spectrum.\nProof. Let v1 and v2 be cyclic vectors for U and V . Denote by C the U \u2297 V -cyclic\nsubspace generated by v1 \u2297 v2 . It follows from (i) and (ii) that\n(I + U (\u03be))v1 \u2297 (I + V (\u03be))v2 \u2208 C.\n(dI + U (\u03be))v1 \u2297 (eI + V (\u03be))v2 \u2208 C.\nHence U (\u03be)v1 \u2297 v2 + v1 \u2297 V (\u03be)v2 \u2208 C and dU (\u03be)v1 \u2297 v2 + ev1 \u2297 V (\u03be)v2 \u2208 C. This\nimplies, in particular that U (\u03be)v1 \u2297 v2 \u2208 C. In a similar way, U (\u2212\u03be)v1 \u2297 v2 \u2208 C.\n12\n\n\fThus, (U (\u03be) \u2297 I)C = C. In a similar way, we deduce from (iii) and (iv) that\n(U (\u03b7) \u2297 I)C = C. Hence (U (n\u03be + m\u03b7) \u2297 I)C = C for all n, m \u2208 Z. Since \u03b7 and \u03be\nare rationally independent, C is invariant under the unitary representation U \u2297 I.\nIt follows that C = H1 \u2297 H2 . \u0003\nLet K, H, v, K, \u03be1, \u03be2 be as in the previous section. We will assume that \u03be2 > \u03be1\nand put \u03be3 := \u03be2 \u2212 \u03be1 . Fix a partition\nN=\n\n3 G\nG\n\nMa,i \u2294 Na\n\ni=1 a\u2208K\n\nof N into infinite subsets.

To show that M(T \u00d7 T \u03b1,H ) = E \u222a {2} we consider a natural decomposition\nof UT \u00d7T \u03b1,H into an orthogonal sum\nUT \u00d7T \u03b1,H =\n\nM\n\n(UT \u2297 UT,\u03c7 ).\n\n[\n\u03c7\u2208K/H\n\nIt is enough to prove the following:\n(a) UT \u2297 UT has a homogeneous spectrum 2 in the orthocomplement to the\nconstants,\n(b) UT \u2297 UT \u03b1 ,\u03c7 has a simple spectrum if \u03c7 6= 0,\n(c) UT \u2297 UT \u03b1 ,\u03c7 and UT \u2297 UT \u03b1 ,\u03be are unitarily equivalent if \u03c7 and \u03be belong to\nthe same vb-orbit,\n(d) the measures of maximal spectral type of UT \u2297 UT \u03b1 ,\u03c7 and UT \u2297 UT \u03b1 ,\u03be are\nmutually singular if \u03c7 and \u03be are not on the same vb-orbit.\n\nIt follows from Lemma 5.3(ii) that WC(UT ) contains operators 0.5(I +UT (\u2212\u03be1 )),\n0.5(I + UT (\u22122\u03be1 )), 0.5(I + UT (\u2212\u03be2 )) and 0.5(I + UT (\u03be1 \u2212 \u03be2 )). Therefore we deduce\n(a) from Lemma 5.1.\n14\n\n\fb The unitary representation UT \u03b1 ,\u03c7 has a simple spectrum\nFix a nontrivial \u03c7 \u2208 K.\n(see the proof of Theorem 3.1). Moreover,\nUT \u03b1 ,\u03c7 (hn ) \u2192 0.5(I + UT \u03b1 ,\u03c7 (\u2212\u03be1 )),\nas M0,1 \u2212 1 \u220b n \u2192 \u221e\n\nUT (hn ) \u2192 0.5(I + UT (\u2212\u03be1 ))\n\nand\n\nUT \u03b1 ,\u03c7 (hn ) \u2192 0.5(I + UT \u03b1 ,\u03c7 (\u2212\u03be2 )),\n\nUT (hn ) \u2192 0.5(I + UT (\u2212\u03be2 ))\n\nas M0,2 \u2212 1 \u220b n \u2192 \u221e.\nby Lemma 5.3(ii). Since \u03c7 is nontrivial, it follows from Algebraic Lemma 1.1 that\nthere is a \u2208 K with l\u03c7 (a) 6= 1. Again by Lemma 5.3(ii),\nUT \u03b1 ,\u03c7 (hn ) \u2192 0.5(l\u03c7 (a)I + UT \u03b1 ,\u03c7 (\u2212\u03be1 )),\nas Ma,1 \u2212 1 \u220b n \u2192 \u221e and\n\nUT (hn ) \u2192 0.5(I + UT (\u2212\u03be1 ))\n\nUT \u03b1 ,\u03c7 (hn ) \u2192 0.5(l\u03c7 (a)I + UT \u03b1 ,\u03c7 (\u2212\u03be2 )),\nas Ma,2 \u2212 1 \u220b n \u2192 \u221e.\n\nUT (hn ) \u2192 0.5(I + UT (\u2212\u03be2 ))\n\nTherefore Lemma 5.2 implies (b).\nAs in the proof of Theorem 4.3 we can define a transformation Sz\u0304 of (X, \u03bc) by\nthe formula (3-1). Then Sz\u0304 \u2208 C(T ). It follows from (A1), (B1) and the definition of\nCn+1 that (3-2) is satisfied. Hence by Lemma 3.3, the cocycle \u03b1\u25e6Sz\u0304 is cohomologous\nto v\u25e6\u03b1. Therefore the unitary representations UT,\u03c7 and UT,\u03be are unitarily equivalent\nwhenever \u03c7 and \u03be lie on the same orbit of vb. This yields (c).\nTo prove (d), we first find a \u2208 G such that l\u03c7 (a) 6= l\u03be (a) (see claim (ii) of\nAlgebraic Lemma).

Then there is an embedding \u03c6 of G into R such that the\nsubgroup \u03c6(R) is dense in R. Indeed, it is well known that G embeds into QN . In\nturn, the later group obviously embeds into R. It remains to note that if an infinite\nsubgroup of R is not isomorphic to Z then it is dense in R.\n15\n\n\fBy Theorem 0.1, there is a weakly mixing action T of R such that M(T ) = E.\nThen the composition T \u25e6 \u03c6 = (T\u03c6(g) )g\u2208G is a weakly mixing action of G with\nM(T \u25e6 \u03c6) = M(T ) = E. \u0003\nThe first claim of the following lemma is, in fact, a slight generalization of Theorem 4.1. If we replace (relax) \"weak mixing\" in its statement with \"ergodic\" then\nit follows from Theorem 4.1 via Proposition 1.1.\nLemma 6.2. Let A be a compact second countable Abelian group.

It is straightforward that\n(6-1)\n\n\u2032 /H \u2032 , v\n\\\n[ b\nc\u2032 , K\nb K/H,\nb\u2032 ) = L(K,\nL(K\nv) = E.\n\nMoreover, the subgroup of v \u2032 -periodic points is countable and dense in K \u2032 . We\n\u2032\n\u2032\nnow construct the skew product flow T \u03b1 ,H in the same way as in Section 4 but\n\u2032\n\u2032\nwith K \u2032 , H \u2032 , v \u2032 instead of K, H, v. We note that T \u03b1 ,H acts on the space (Y, \u03bd) :=\n(X \u00d7 K/H \u00d7 A, \u03bc \u00d7 \u03bbK/H \u00d7 \u03bbA ). Denote by W = (Wt,a )(t,a)\u2208R\u00d7A the action of the\n\u2032\n\u2032\nproduct group R \u00d7 A on (Y, \u03bd) generated by T \u03b1 ,H and the action of A by rotations\n\u2032\n\u2032\nalong the third coordinate. Then W is free. Since T \u03b1 ,H is weakly mixing, so is\nW . Denote by UW the corresponding Koopman unitary representation of R \u00d7 A in\nL20 (Y, \u03bd). We have a decomposition\nM\nL2 (Y, \u03bd) =\nH\u03c7,\u03b7 ,\n[\nb\n\u03c7\u2208K/H,\u03b7\u2208\nA\n\nwhere H\u03c7,\u03b7 := L2 (X, \u03bc) \u2297 \u03c7 \u2297 \u03b7. We know from Section 4 that H\u03c7,\u03b7 is a UT \u03b1\u2032 ,H \u2032 cyclic subspace for each pair \u03c7, \u03b7. It is also a UW -cyclic subspace. The unitary\noperator UW (0, a) acts on H\u03c7,\u03b7 by multiplying on \u03b7(a). Hence if \u03c3\u03c7,\u03b7 is a measure\nb\u00d7A\nb\nof maximal spectral type of UT \u03b1\u2032 ,H \u2032 \u21be H\u03c7,\u03b7 then the measure \u03c3\u03c7,\u03b7 \u00d7 \u03b4\u03b7 on R\nis a measure of maximal spectral type of UW \u21be H\u03c7,\u03b7 . As was shown in Section 4,\nif (\u03c7, \u03b7) and (\u03c7\u2032 , \u03b7 \u2032 ) belong to different v \u2032 -orbits then \u03c3\u03c7,\u03b7 \u22a5 \u03c3\u03c7\u2032 ,\u03b7 \u2032 . It follows that\n\u03c3\u03c7,\u03b7 \u00d7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u22a5 \u03c3\u03c7\u2032 ,\u03b7 \u2032 \u00d7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u2032 . On the other hand, if (\u03c7, \u03b7) and (\u03c7\u2032 , \u03b7 \u2032 ) belong to the\nsame v \u2032 -orbit then \u03c3\u03c7,\u03b7 \u223c \u03c3\u03c7\u2032 ,\u03b7 \u2032 . Moreover, \u03b7 = \u03b7 \u2032 by the definition of v \u2032 . Hence\n\u03c3\u03c7,\u03b7 \u00d7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u223c \u03c3\u03c7\u2032 ,\u03b7 \u2032 \u00d7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u2032 . These facts plus (6-1) imply that M(W ) = E.\n(ii) Consider two cases. If G is not Z then (ii) follows from (i) in the very same\nway as Corollary 6.1 follows from Theorem 0.1. If G is Z then we need to modify\nthe proof of the main result from [Da3] (only the case when E \u220b 1) in the very\nsame way as we modified the proof of Theorem 4.1 in (i). \u0003\nLet T1 and T2 be probability preserving ergodic actions of locally compact second\ncountable Abelian groups G1 and G2 respectively. Let T1 \u2297T2 stand for the product\naction (g1 , g2 ) 7\u2192 T1 (g1 ) \u00d7 T2 (g2 ) of the product group G1 \u00d7 G2 . It is easy to see\nthat\n(\u2022) if T1 has a simple spectrum then M(T1 \u2297 T2 ) = M(T2 ) \u222a {1}.\nAs far as we know, this fact was first used in [Fi] for Z2 -actions.\n16\n\n\fCorollary 6.3. Let E \u220b 1. If one of the following conditions is satisfied\n(i) G contains a closed one-parameter subgroup,\n(ii) G = D \u00d7 F , where D is a torsion free discrete countable Abelian group and\nF is a locally compact second countable Abelian group then\nthere is a free weakly mixing action T of G such that M(T ) = E.\nProof. (i) It follows from [HR, Theorem 24.30] that G is topologically isomorphic\nto a product R \u00d7 G\u2032 , where G\u2032 is a locally compact Abelian group.\nSuppose first that G\u2032 is non-compact. We now claim that there is a weakly\nmixing free G\u2032 -action with a simple spectrum. To prove this claim we need several\nstandard auxiliary facts which we state here without proof.\n\u2212 Let A be the set of all G\u2032 -actions on a standard probability space (X, \u03bc). A\nG\u2032 -action is considered as a continuous map from G\u2032 to the Polish (in the\nweak topology) group of all transformations of (X, \u03bc). Then A endowed\nwith the topology of uniform convergence on the compact subsets in G\u2032 is\nPolish.\n\u2212 The conjugacy class of every free G\u2032 -action is dense in A.\n\u2212 The subset of all weakly mixing G\u2032 -actions and the subset of all G\u2032 -actions\nwith a simple spectrum are both G\u03b4 in A.\n\u2212 There is a weakly mixing free G\u2032 -action and there is a free G\u2032 -action with\na simple spectrum.\nThe claim follows from them via a generic argument. Now we deduce the assertion\nof the Corollary 6.3 from Theorem 0.1 and (\u2022).\nConsider now the second case when G\u2032 is compact. Then the assertion of the\nCorollary 6.3 follows from Lemma 6.2(i).\n(ii) is proved in a similar way by replacing the references to Theorem 0.1 and\nLemma 6.2(i) with references to Corollary 6.1 and Lemma 6.2(ii) respectively. \u0003\nWe note that if G is connected then (i) is satisfied. If G has no non-trivial\ncompact subgroups then one of the conditions of Corollary 6.3 is satisfied.\nWe claim that Theorem 0.1, the case 2 \u2208 E, holds true if we replace R-actions\nwith actions of groups G which are isomorphic to the product of Rd with torsion\nfree discrete Abelian groups. However to prove this fact one has to pass all the way\nof Section 5 by adjusting all the arguments from there to the case of Rd -actions.\nWe leave this routine to the reader.\nReferences\n[Ag]\n[Da1]\n[Da2]\n[Da3]\n[DaS]\n[Fi]\n[Fr]\n\nO.
