Introduction\nThe first family of mirror varieties which were neither toric, nor complete intersections, was\nintroduced independently by Borcea [5] and Voisin [24]. They construct Calabi-Yau threefolds and\nfourfolds by taking the quotient by an appropriate involution of the product of lower dimensional\nCalabi-Yau varieties (with Z/2Z symmetry, or larger symmetry in the case of Borcea). Their\nconstruction and the closedness under ther mirror map of the manifolds they build, rely on the\nduality between K3 surfaces endowed with a non-symplectic involution, which was discovered by\nNikulin [16].\nThe Borcea-Voisin construction is actually similar to the one of Vafa and Witten [23] who take the\nquotient of the product of three tori by a group of automorphisms which preserve the volume form\nto study interesting physical models. In both cases, the procedure consists of taking as building\nblocks varieties X1 , . . . , Xn , each endowed with a unique volume form, and then taking the quotient\nof their product by some subgroup of the product of automorphism groups consisting of symmetries\npreserving the total volume form. This approach has given rise to semi-realistic heterotic models\nwhose study was pioneered by Dixon, Harvey, Vafa and Witten in [10]. All possible varieties\nobtained as quotients of products of tori were classified by Donagi and Faraggi [11], Donagi and\nWendland [12], and Dillies [9].\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Calabi-Yau, Borcea-Voisin construction, non-symplectic automorphism.\nThe author would like to thank Professor Ron Donagi for informing him of the existence of references [4] and [19],\nMax Pumperla for pointing out a typo in an earlier version and the anonymous referees for thoughtful suggestions.\n1\n\n\fIn this paper, we study and classify the Calabi-Yaus obtained through the construction of Borcea\nand Voisin in two directions. First, we allow cyclic groups of arbitrary prime order, that is, any\nprime less than or equal to 19, as shown in [16]. Second, we construct both three and fourfolds. Our\naim is, first, to find new mirror manifolds, second, to illustrate what could go wrong in constructing\nmirror maps when using higher order automorphisms.\nNote that some of the examples which appear in our classification were known before. For\nexample, Borcea [5, 6] constructs several examples of Calabi-Yau varieties in higher dimension. In\n[1], Mitsuko and Masamichi consider threefolds and fourfolds which can be studied through toric\ngeometry. They obtain a small subset of the classification which we obtain hereunder. Cynk and\nHulek [8] construct and study examples of threefolds and fourfolds using involutions and higher\norder automorphisms and prove modularity for classes with complex multiplication. In [21], Rohde\nstudies, among others, Calabi-Yau threefolds obtained by taking the quotient of the product of an\nelliptic curve and a K3 surface by an automorphism of order 3 fixing only points or rational curves\non the K3 surface. Garbagnati and van Geemen [14] study explicitly the Picard-Fuchs equation\nof a certain familiy constructed by Rohde. Finally, in [13], Garbagnati constructs examples of\nCalabi-Yau threefolds by using automorphisms of order 4.\n2. Plan\nAfter giving a brief description of the notation in Section 3, we will start by an overview of\nthe results in Section 4. In Section 5, we describe the generalized construction of Borcea-Voisin\norbifolds. In Section 6, we compute the orbifold cohomology of our varieties and in Section 7\nwe list all possible topological types of Borcea-Voisin spaces which we obtain and describe their\nfundamental group. Finally, in Section 8, we discuss how much of the mirror map established for\nBorcea-Voisin threefolds in [6, 24] remains true for our construction.\nThe appendix synthesizes the results about non-symplectic automorphisms of prime order on K3\nsurfaces which are needed for the classification.\n3. Notation\nIn this paper, we will denote by X the product of the Calabi-Yau manifolds X1 and X2 . The\nsurface Xi is endowed with a non-symplectic automorphism \u03c1i of order p that fixes a curve of\ngenus g, li rational curves, and pi isolated points.1. These points will be further characterized by\nthe linearized form of \u03c1 along their tangent space. We will call ni the number of points of type\n1\np (i + 1, p \u2212 i). Each surface Xi will be characterized by a triple (p, ri , ai ) where p is the order of the\nnon-symplectic automorphism \u03c1i , ri the rank of the invariant part S of H 2 (Xi ) and det(S) = pai .\ni\nMoreover, \u03bbi will be a shorthand notation for 22\u2212r\np\u22121 . Also, at times, we will use the symbol \u03b1 as\ndefined in [3] or in Table 3.\n4. Results\nUsing the recent classification of non-symplectic automorphisms of prime order on K3 surfaces\n(see [3], or Appendix A for a working synopsis) we construct families of generalized Calabi-Yau\norbifolds in dimensions 3 and 4. We classify all topological families and see that for p odd, distinct\npairs of K3 surfaces yield distinct Calabi-Yau orbifolds.\nIn dimension 4, the family attached to the prime 2 consists of orbifolds admitting crepant resolutions\nand the set of Calabi-Yau manifolds which we obtain is closed under the topological mirror map,\ni.e. for each X in our family, there exists another variety X\u030c such that hp,q (X) = hd\u2212p,q (X\u030c).\n1\n\n\u007f\n\nWhen a K3 surface has no fixed points, we will set g = 0 and, following the convention of [3], l = \u22121.\n2\n\n\fFor the other primes, we show that except in two cases, there is no crepant resolution, and that\nthese Calabi-Yau orbifolds do not come in mirror pairs.\n5. Construction\nConsider two pairs (X1 , \u03c11 ) and (X2 , \u03c12 ) each consisting of a Calabi-Yau manifold and a primitive\nnon-symplectic automorphism of order p. Pick a volume form \u03c9i on each surface. Without loss\nof generality, we can assume that the characters induced by the action on the volume forms are\nidentical, i.e. \u03c1\u22171 \u03c91 = \u03b6p \u03c91 and \u03c1\u22172 \u03c92 = \u03b6p \u03c92 , for the same pth root of unity \u03b6p . On the product\nvariety X = X1 \u00d7 X2 , we get an induced action of Z/pZ \u00d7 Z/pZ and a character map\n\u03c7 : Z/pZ \u00d7 Z/pZ \u2192 C\u00d7 : (\u03c1i1 , \u03c1j2 ) 7\u2192 \u03b6pi+j\nwhich determines the action on the volume form of X. Let G \u223c\n= Z/pZ be the kernel of \u03c7.\nDefinition 5.1. Given two pairs (X1 , \u03c11 ) and (X2 , \u03c12 ) as above, we call X/G the associated Borcea] of the quotient exists, we call it the associated BorceaVoisin orbifold. If a crepant resolution X/G\nVoisin manifold.\nThe case where p = 2, dim X1 = 1 and dim X2 = 2 is the classical Borcea-Voisin construction.\nNote that since G consists of automorphisms preserving the volume form of the product, the\nquotient still has a volume form. Moreover, all singularities are Gorenstein, thus, by the work of\nRoan [20], we can conclude that if the codimension of each component of the fixed locus of (\u03c11 , \u03c12 )\nhas codimension strictly less than 4, then such a resolution exists. In particular, this is the case\nwhen dim X \u2264 3.\n6. Orbifold cohomology\nWe start from the orbifold cohomology formula of Chen and Ruan [7]\nM\nM\n(6.1)\nH*,*\nH \u2217\u2212\u03ba(g,\u039b),\u2217\u2212\u03ba(g,\u039b) (\u039b)G\norb (X/G) =\ng\u2208Conj(G) \u039b\u2208\u03a6(g)\n\nwhere \u03a6(g) is the set of irreducible components fixed by g, and \u03ba(g, \u039b) is the age of g at a point of\n\u039b. Since the group G is cyclic of prime order, we can pick a generator \u03b3 and the formula simplifies\nto\np\u22121\nM M\ni\ni\nG\n\u2217,\u2217\nH \u2217\u2212\u03ba(\u03b3 ,\u039b),\u2217\u2212\u03ba(\u03b3 ,\u039b) (\u039b) .\nH*,*\n(X/G)\n=\nH\n(X)\n\u2295\norb\n\u039b\u2208\u03a6(\u03b3) i=1\n\nTo linearize the notation we will make use of Hodge polynomials, i.e. h(X)(s, t) is an integral\npolynomial whose coefficient of bi-degree (i, j) is the dimension dim H i,j (X). Hence, what we need\nto determine, for each orbifold X, is the following Hodge polynomial:\n(6.2)\n\nhorb (X/G)(s, t) = h(X)G (s, t) +\n\np\u22121\nX X\ni\n(st)\u03ba(\u03b3 ,\u039b) h (\u039b) (s, t).\n\n\u039b\u2208\u03a6(\u03b3) i=1\n\nIn the following sections we will compute individually each summand. We will start by the invariant\npart and then focus on the contribution coming from the fixed components together with their\ni\nassociated weight (st)\u03ba(\u03b3 ,\u039b) . Fixed components will be separated according to their codimension.\n3\n\n\f6.1. G-invariant part.\nLemma 6.1. Given p, assume that the K3 surface Xi is defined by the pair (ri , ai ) and let\ni\n\u03bbi = 22\u2212r\np\u22121 . If Xi is an elliptic curve, p \u2208 {2, 3} and Xi is unique.\n\u2022 When both Xi 's are K3 surfaces, the G-invariant part, h(X)G (s, t), decomposes as\n(6.3)\n1+(st)4 +s4 +t4 +(st3 +ts3 )(\u03bb1 +\u03bb2 \u22122)+(st+(st)3 )(r1 +r2 )+(st)2 (4\u22122(\u03bb1 +\u03bb2 )+r1 r2 +(p\u22121)\u03bb1 \u03bb2 )\nwhen p is odd, and as\n(6.4) 1+(st)4 +s4 +t4 +(st3 +ts3 )(\u03bb1 +\u03bb2 \u22124)+(st+(st)3 )(r1 +r2 )+(st)2 (8\u22122(\u03bb1 +\u03bb2 )+r1 r2 +\u03bb1 \u03bb2 )\nwhen p = 2.\n\u2022 When X1 is a K3 surface and X2 is an elliptic curve, the G-invariant part, h(X)G (s, t),\ndecomposes as\n(6.5)\n\n1 + (st)3 + s3 + t3 + (r1 + 1)(st + (st)2 ) + (\u03bb1 \u2212 1)(st2 + s2 t).\n\nProof. By K\u00fcnneth's formula one can decompose the G-invariant cohomology of X as\nG\n\nh(X) (s, t) =\n\np\u22121\nX\n\nh(X1 )[\u03b6pi ](s, t) \u00d7 h(X2 )[\u03b6pi ](s, t)\n\ni=0\n\nwhere H(Xi )[\u03b6] is the \u03b6 eigenspace associated to the action of Gi = Z/pZ, generated by \u03c1i . When\nXi is a K3 surface, we define \u03bbi,l = dim(H 1,1 (Xi ) \u2229 H(Xi )[\u03b6pl ]). Since the trace of \u03b6 \u2217 is integral, we\ni\nconclude that for l > 0, \u03bbi,1 = * * * = \u03bbi,p\u22121 = \u03bbi = 22\u2212r\np\u22121 . Therefore, if p > 2,\n1. h(Xi )[1](s, t) = (1 + (st)2 ) + ri st,\n2. h(Xi )[\u03b6](s, t) = h(Xi )[\u03b6 p\u22121 ](t, s) = s2 + (\u03bbi \u2212 1)st, and\n3. h(Xi )[\u03b6 l ](s, t) = \u03bbi st for 2 \u2264 l \u2264 p \u2212 2\nwhile, if p = 2\n1. h(Xi )[1](s, t) = (1 + (st)2 ) + ri st,\n2. h(Xi )[\u22121](s, t) = h(Xi )[\u03b6 p\u22121 ](t, s) = s2 + (\u03bbi \u2212 2)st + t2 .\nWhen Xi is an elliptic curve, we only need to deal with p = 3 as this is the only possible prime\norder of complex multiplication besides 2. In that case,\n1. h(Xi )[1](s, t) = 1 + st,\n2. h(Xi )[\u03b6](s, t) = h(Xi )[\u03b6 p\u22121 ](t, s) = s.\nThe final result follows from a direct computation.\n\n\u0003\n\n6.2. Contribution of fixed locus. Since the codimension of the fixed locus contributes to a\ndifference in grading in the contribution to cohomology, we will split the fixed locus accordingly.\nFor threefolds, we will have codimension 2 and 3 fixed loci and for fourfolds, we will have fixed loci\nof codimension 2,3 or 4. Before we proceed with our analysis, we will begin by a short study of the\npossible ages along the fixed components.\n6.2.1. Preamble on age.

If we diagonalize\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n\fwith 0 \u2264 ki < 1, then we define the age of \u03c1 along the fixed component \u039b containing P as\n\u03ba(\u03c1, \u039b) =\n\nn\nX\n\nki .\n\ni=1\n\nLemma 6.2. The age of an element and its inverse at a given point are related by \u03ba(\u03c1, \u039b) +\n\u03ba(\u03c1\u22121 , \u039b) = codim(\u039b, X).\nProof. If \u03c1 linearizes to diag(1, . . . , 1, e2\u03c0ikj+1 , . . . , e2\u03c0ikn ), then, with respect to the same basis, \u03c1\u22121\ntakes the form diag(1, . . . , 1, e2\u03c0i(1\u2212kj+1 ) , . . . , e2\u03c0i(1\u2212kn ) ), where j = dim(\u039b) and kl > 0 for l > j. \u0003\nCorollary 6.3. Let G be a group acting faithfully on a manifold X of dimension n \u2265 3, and whose\ntangent action at a fixed point lies in the special linear group. Take g an element different from the\nidentity, and \u039b an irreducible component of the fixed locus of g. We have:\n1. \u03ba(g, \u039b) = 1 if \u039b is of codimension 2.\n2. \u03ba(g, \u039b) \u2208 {1, 2} if \u039b is of codimension 3.\n3. \u03ba(g, \u039b) \u2208 {1, 2, 3} if \u039b is of codimension 4.\nProof. Note that when g \u2208 G is a finite subgroup of SL, the age of g is an integer. Since g is\ndifferent from the identity and the action is faithful, \u03ba(g, .) \u2265 1. The rest follows from the previous\nlemma.\n\u0003\n6.3. Threefolds. Given that the only possible prime orders for complex multiplication are 2 and 3,\nin this section we will only make use of K3 surfaces endowed with non-symplectic automorphisms of\norder 3. Also recall that an elliptic curve with complex multiplication of order 3 is defined uniquely.\nMoreover, the automorphism fixes 3 isolated points.\n6.3.1. Codimension 2.\nLemma 6.4. The contribution to the cohomology from the fixed curves on X is\n(6.6)\n\nh(S)(s, t) = 3 ((1 + st)(l1 + 1) + (s + t)g1 )\n\nProof. We know from [2] that for p = 3 there is at most one curve of non-zero genus. Recalling\nthat there are 3 fixed points on the elliptic curve, the result is immediate.\n\u0003\nFrom Lemma 6.2, we know that the age of any element along a fixed curve is 1 and this polynomial\nis thus weighted by (p \u2212 1)st.\n6.3.2. Codimension 3. In this case, we are dealing with points and the Hodge polynomial for each\nfixed point is equal to 1. Counting them all, we get a contribution of\nh(P)(s, t) = 3p1 .\nMoreover, since we are in codimension 3, Lemma 6.2 tells us that if an element has age 1 at a point\nP , its inverse will have age 2. The weight of the contribution of the fixed points is thus\n(p \u2212 1)\n\nst + (st)2\n.\n2\n\n6.4. Fourfolds.\n5\n\n\f6.4.1. Codimension 2. The dimension 2 part of the fixed locus on X consists of the product of\nthe fixed curves on each Xi . The fixed curves on Xi have as total Hodge polynomial h(Ci )(s, t) =\n(1 + st)(li + 1) + (s + t)(gi ). From K\u00fcnneth's formula we get directly:\nLemma 6.5. The contribution to the cohomology from the fixed surfaces on X is\n(6.7)\nh(S)(s, t) = (1+(st)2 )(l1 +1)(l2 +1)+(s+t+s2 t+t2 s)[(1+l1 )g2 +(1+l2 )g1 ]+2st[(1+l1 )(1+l2 )+g1 g2 ].\nMoreover, we know from Corollary 6.3 that \u03ba(., S) is identically equal to 1 and thus the above\npolynomial is weighted by (p \u2212 1)(st).\n6.4.2. Codimension 3.\nLemma 6.6. The contribution to the cohomology from the fixed curves on X is\n(6.8)\n\nh(S)(s, t) = (1 + st) ((l1 + 1)p2 + (l2 + 1)p1 ) + (s + t) (g1 p2 + g2 p1 ) .\n\nProof. The result follows once again from K\u00fcnneth's formula:\nh(C)(s, t) =\n\n2\nX\n\nh(Ci )(s, t) \u00d7 h(P3\u2212i )(s, t).\n\ni=1\n\n\u0003\n2\n\nSince \u03ba(g, C) = 3\u2212\u03ba(g \u22121 , C) (Corollary 6.3), the above polynomial is weighted by (p\u22121) (st)+(st)\n.\n2\n6.4.3. Codimension 4. In this case, we are dealing with points and the Hodge polynomial for each\nfixed point is trivial:\nh(P)(s, t) = 1.\nOn the other hand, it is not automatic to deduce the weight coming from the age of the powers of\nthe generator at a given point. In this section, given a variety X, we will determine the integers\nNi (p), which are the number of times a power of the group generator has an age of i \u2208 {1, 2, 3} at\nan isolated fixed point. The contribution to the cohomology will then be of\n3\nX\n\n(6.9)\n\nNi (p)(st)i .\n\ni=1\n\nFrom Lemma 6.2 and Corollary 6.3, we know that we only need to determine the number of times\na point comes with a shift of 2. Indeed, we have the relations\nN1 (p) = N3 (p)\nand\n3\nX\n\nNi (p) = (p \u2212 1) \u00d7 #{fixed points}.\n\ni=1\n\nLemma 6.7.

The computations are long and tedious but trivial. For example, one can notice that along\na diagonal, an element will always have a linearization of the form (ni + 1, p \u2212 ni , p \u2212 ni \u2212 1, ni ) and\nthat the age will always be 2. Therefore, any element different from the identity in G will have the\nsame age at such a point.\n\u0003\nDefinition 6.8. Given a non-symplectic automorphism of order p acting on a K3 surface defined\nby the pair (r, a), we define vp (r) to be the p\u22121\n2 dimensional row vector of natural numbers whose\nth\ni entry is the number of fixed points of type 1p (i + 1, \u2212i).\nThis vector can be read from Table 3 in the Appendix. Given P2 (p) and vp (ri ), it is easy to\ndetermine the number of times an element acts at a fixed point of X with a given age:\nLemma 6.9. The number of shifts by 2 is equal to\nN2 (p) = vp (r1 )P2 (p)vp (r2 )t\nLet \u03b1i be as in Table 3. We obtain as a direct consequence:\nCorollary 6.10. Given a pair of K3 surfaces defined by (r1 , a1 ) and (r2 , a2 ), we define \u03b1i as in\nTable 2. The number of shifts by 2 on the product is\n7. Topological types\nIn this section, we give the Hodge diamonds of the generalized Borcea-Voisin orbifolds. We write\ndown a formula for the Euler characteristic and give the range of values that are taken. All possible\nvalues that can be taken for (r1 , a1 ) and (r2 , a2 ) are listed in Appendix A.\n7.1.

However, Table 2 and the genus formula A.1 tell us that the fixed locus consists of a\ngenus 2 curve and an isolated rational curve.

Fundamental groups. It follows from the argument in [10] that the fundamental group of\nour orbifolds is isomorphic to the quotient of G by the subgroup generated by elements fixing at\nleast a point. Since G is cyclic of prime order, either the fundamental group will be trivial, or it\nwill be cyclic of order p. Actually, all orbifolds will be simply connected except for p = 2 when at\nleast one of the surfaces is defined by (r = 10, a = 10), in which case there are no fixed points and\nthe fundamental group is Z/2Z.\n10\n\n\f8. On the mirror map\nVoisin [24] and Borcea [6] show how the Calabi-Yau threefolds which they construct come in\ntopological mirror pairs. It is easy to check from the above data that their result extends to\nfourfolds. Generalized Borcea-Voisin orbifolds with p = 2 admit crepant resolutions and come in\ntopological mirror pairs.\nProposition 8.1. The Borcea-Voisin fourfolds X and X\u030c defined respectively by (r1 , a1 , r2 , a2 ) and\n(20 \u2212 r1 , a1 , 20 \u2212 r2 , a2 ) for p = 2 are topological mirrors, i.e.\nhp,q (X) = h4\u2212p,q (X\u030c)\nMoreover, from the Euler characteristic formulas for the Borcea-Voisin orbifolds, one deduces\nimmediately that the above does not hold anymore for p odd2. Indeed, it is easy to check that\nthere is no integral constant m such that the map (r1 , r2 ) 7\u2192 (m \u2212 r1 , m \u2212 r2 ) leaves the Euler\ncharacteristic invariant. Therefore, we can abandon any hope of finding a mirror map between\nBorcea-Voisin orbifolds for p > 2 in dimension 4. Similarly, one checks readily that for p = 3,\nBorcea-Voisin threefolds do not come in mirror pairs; there is no involution on the set of pairs (r, a)\nwhich sends a Hodge diamond to its reflection.\nThe non-closedness of the Borcea-Voisin family under mirror symmetry has several possible\nexplanations. We enumerate here the three main obstacles.\n1. For p > 5, there is no more symmetry of the type r \u2194 20 \u2212 r between the possible pairs\n(r, a) defining K3 surfaces with an order p non-symplectic automorphism. See e.g. Figure\n1. For p = 3 or 5, one can find an axis of symmetry (up to a few elements) among the pairs\n(r, a) but one can check that there is no topological relation binding the orbifolds which are\nbased on symmetric pairs.\n2. Mirror symmetry is predicted to exist for Calabi-Yau manifolds near a large complex structure\npoint. For the threefold case, p = 3, the elliptic curve is rigid. It is the quotient of the complex\nplane by the lattice generated by 1 and a primitive sixth root of unity. One can not endow\nit with a large complex structure. For p = 2, the involution exists for any complex curve of\ngenus 1 and there is thus no obstruction to deforming the complex structure.\n3. For the fourfolds, except when p = 2, the fixed locus contains isolated fixed points and there\nis, for that reason, no guaranteed crepant resolution. Actually, we can show that most of the\norbifolds which we construct have no crepant resolution:\nProposition 8.2. Let p > 2 and X be the Borcea-Voisin orbifold defined by (r1 , a1 , r2 , a2 ),\nthen X does not have a crepant resolution except when p = 3 and r1 = r2 = 2.\nProof. If X has a fixed point of type 1p (2, p \u2212 1, 1, p \u2212 2), we know from Batyrev-Dais [4] and\nReid [19] that there does not exist a crepant resolution. Such points exist as soon as both\nsurfaces involved in the construction have a fixed point of type 1p (2, p\u22121). Indeed, the product\npoint will have a linearized action under the product element in G of (2, p\u22121)\u00d7(2, p\u22121)\u22121 =\n(2, p \u2212 1, p \u2212 2, 1).\nFrom Table 3, we see that for p \u2208 {3, 5, 7, 11}, any K3 surface admitting a non-symplectic\nautomorphism of order p has a fixed point of type 1p (2, p \u2212 1) except for the surfaces where\np = 3 and r = 2. In the latter case, there are only fixed curves on each K3 surface and the\nassociated Borcea-Voisin orbifolds admit a crepant resolution.\n\u0003\n2For p = 3, one notices however that if two threefolds (resp. fourfolds) are based on the data (r, a) and (12 \u2212 r, a)\n(resp. (r1 , a1 , r2 , a2 ) and (12 \u2212 r1 , a1 , 12 \u2212 r2 , a2 )), their Euler characteristics are opposite (resp. identical).\n11\n\n\fThe above indices lead us to the belief that the mirrors of generalized Borcea-Voisin\norbifolds with p \u2265 3 will not come under this form. It would be interesting to see if they\ncould be englobed into a larger construction.\n\n12\n\n\fAppendix A. Possible non-symplectic actions on K3 surfaces\nWe enumerate hereunder (A.1) all possible primes p for which there exists a non-symplectic\nZ/pZ action on a K3 surface. Also, we enumerate all pairs (r, a) which determine the lattice of the\nK3 surfaces admitting such an action. The integer r gives the rank of the invariant part S of the\ncohomology under the group action and a is defined as det(S) = pa . For p = 2, a third invariant\n\u03b4 \u2208 {0, 1} is needed. The elements corresponding to \u03b4 = 0 have been marked with a \u2217 in the list.\nThe importance of r and a is that these two natural numbers completely determine the fixed\nlocus of the group action. Theorem A.1 hereunder, due to Artebani, Sarti and Taki, gives an\noverview of the state of the art. It encompasses the classification of involutions, done by Nikulin\n[16], of automorphisms of order 3, done by Artebani-Sarti [2] and Taki [22], of automorphisms of\norder 5 and 7, done by Artebani-Sarti-Taki [3], of automorphisms of order 11, done by OguisoZhang [17], and of automorphisms of order 13, 17 and 19 done by Vorontsov [25], Kond\u014d [15] and\nby Oguiso-Zhang [18].\nTheorem A.1. [3, Theorem 0.1] Let S be a hyperbolic p-elementary lattice (p prime) of rank r\nwith det(S) = pa .

Namely, given a prime p, an isolated fixed point of a non-symplectic\nautomorphism will be called of type 1p (i + 1, p \u2212 i)(i \u2208 {0, . . . , p \u2212 2}), if the action can locally be\nlinearized as\n\u0013\n\u0012 i+1\n0\n\u03b6p\n0\n\u03b6pp\u22121\nWe will denote by ni the number of such points.
