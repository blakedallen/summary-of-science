This success was driven by the\nthird generation of ground based Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope\nSystems (IACT), such as H.E.S.S., with an order of magnitude better sensitivity compared to the previous generation instruments (see e.g. [1,2] for a\nrecent review).The improvement was made possible by the use of stereoscopic\nsystems of large telescopes equipped with finely pixelated fast cameras.\nTo reconstruct the direction and energy of the primary gamma-ray and to discriminate them from charged cosmic rays most of the current experiments use\nreconstruction techniques based on the second moments of the pixel amplitudes in the camera (Hillas parameters) [3,4]. These techniques are very robust\nand efficient. However, a more sophisticated albeit more computing time intensive reconstruction technique was pioneered by the CAT experiment [5],\ntaking advantage of its very finely pixelized camera. The technique is based\non a \u03c72 comparison of the recorded Cherenkov light distributions of a photon\ninduced electromagnetic shower in the camera, i.e. the shower images, with\ncalculated shower images from a model of the Cherenkov light distribution in\nelectromagnetic showers. The reconstruction technique presented in this paper (Model Analysis) is a further development and improvement of this early\nwork.\nThe calculated shower images are derived from the Cherenkov light distribution of charged particles in electromagnetic showers taking into account light\ncollection efficiencies, atmospheric absorption etc. The Cherenkov light distribution of a shower is determined by the longitudinal, lateral, and angular\ndistributions of charged particles in the shower. These distributions are derived from Monte Carlo simulations and parametrised to yield an analytical\ndescription of the shower, i.e. the shower model, including the depth of the\nfirst interaction as a new parameter in the parametrisation. Additionally, the\ncontribution of the night sky background noise in the camera in every pixel is\nmodelled on the basis of a detailed statistical analysis. Thus the fit procedure\ndoes not require a dedicated image cleaning procedure to extract the pixels\nilluminated by the shower. The parameters of the calculated shower that best\nfits the measured shower image are determined in a minimisation procedure\nwhich yields a selection criteria to discriminate the gamma-ray induced shower\nfrom the hadronic background.\nThe different parts of the model, i.e. the semi-analytical description of the\nshower development are described in section 1, and are used in section 2 to\ngenerate the shower image templates. In section 3 the fit algorithm is de2\n\n\fscribed. Finally, section 4 is devoted to the description of the performance\nof source analysis using this model reconstruction, with detailed comparison\nwith alternate reconstruction techniques.\n\n1\n\nCharged particle distributions in an electromagnetic shower\n\nThe model of the pixel illumination by Cherenkov light in the camera is based\non analytical descriptions of the energy-dependent longitudinal, lateral, and\nangular distributions of charged particles in electromagnetic showers. The electromagnetic showers were generated with the KASKADE [6] shower simulation program. The KASKADE program has been improved to include among\nothers a more precise treatment of Bhabha and Moller scattering [7,8]. A\ndetailed comparison of several generators in the H.E.S.S.-collaboration, including CORSIKA [9], showed no noticeable difference between the different\ngenerators.\nIn order to cover the dynamical range of the H.E.S.S. instruments, showers\nwere generated at energies of 10 GeV, 50 GeV, 100 GeV, 500 GeV, 1 TeV,\n5 TeV, 10 TeV and 20 TeV. Typical number of showers required for the generation of a smooth model range from \u223c 200000 at low energy to a few hundred\nat the highest energies. The varying number of showers ensure that different\nprimary energies have similar weights in the model construction.\nThe model for atmospheric electromagnetic showers presented here is an extension of the model proposed by Hillas in [10]. The nomenclature used here\nfollows closely the nomenclature of the model by Hillas.\nAs the dominant source of shower-to-shower fluctuations, the depth of the first\ninteraction is included as a new parameter in the parametrisation. This helps\nreducing the discrepancy between actual shower images and model predictions,\nand thus improves the reconstruction and discrimination efficiency.\n\n1.1 Longitudinal distribution of charged particles\nThe average number of charged particles Ne (y, t) in simulated electromagnetic\nshowers as a function of the distance to the first interaction point t for different\nprimary photon energies are shown in fig. 1. The longitudinal distributions are\nmodelled by a modified Greisen formula[11]:\n\"\n\na\nb\nNe (y, t) = \u221a \u00d7 exp t \u00d7 1 \u2212\n\u00d7 ln(s)\ny\nb\u22121\n3\n\n!#\n\na\n+ 2\u2212 \u221a\ny\n\n!\n\n\u00d7 exp(\u2212t)(1)\n\n\fwhere y = ln(Eprim /Ecrit ) is the scaled primary photon energy with Eprim\nbeing the primary photon energy and Ecrit being the critical energy (Ecrit \u2248\n83 MeV in air). The first part of the expression corresponds to the standard\nGreisen formula, with parameters a and b left free. The second part describes\nthe decay of the two charged particles created at the first interaction point\nt = 0 and ensures Ne (y, t = 0) = 2. The shower depth t is given in units\nof radiation lengths. The shower age s measured from the point of the first\ninteraction is given by\ns=\n\nb\n1 + c \u00d7 (b \u2212 1)/t\n\n(2)\n\nThis expression is constructed so that the shower age being s = 0 at the first\ninteraction and s = 1 at the shower maximum. The parameter c is the depth\nof shower maximum measured from the first interaction (s = 1 for t = c)\nand b is a scaling factor related to speed of the shower development. The\nparameters a and c are found to be linearly dependent on the scaled energy\ny. A fit of the analytical description on the simulated distributions yielded for\nthe parameters a, b and c:\na = 1.05 + 0.033 \u00d7 y,\n\nc = 0.97 \u00d7 y \u2212 1.32\n\nb = 2.66,\n\n(3)\n\nAs can be seen in fig. 1 the analytical description is in good agreement (at a\nlevel of \u223c 5% in the central depth range, degrading to \u223c 20% in the shower\ntail and \u223c 40% in the shower head) with the simulation for primary energies\nranging from 10 GeV to more than 20 TeV,with slightly worse performances\nat the very high and very low energies.\nThe Cherenkov light distribution of an electromagnetic shower depends on the\nenergy dependent longitudinal distributions of charged particles in the shower\ndNe /dE with\nNe =\n\nZ\n\ndNe\ndE.,\ndE\n\nNe (E \u2265 E0 ) =\n\nZ\u221e\n\nE0\n\ndNe\ndE.\ndE\n\n(4)\n\nExamples of the longitudinal distributions of charged particles dNe /dt(E \u2265\nE0 ) in the shower integrated over charge particle energy E above some threshold E0 (10 MeV, 20 MeV, 40 MeV, 80 MeV, 150 MeV, 300 MeV, 600 MeV,\n1 GeV and 2 GeV) and for different primary photon energies is shown in\nFig. 2 .

As described in Moliere theory, the relevant angle of the\ncharged particles is the reduced angle w given as\nE\nw = 2(1 \u2212 cos \u03b8) \u00d7\n21 MeV\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\n\u2248\n\n\u03b8E\n21 MeV\n\n!2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the angle between the direction of the primary particle and the\ndirection of the charged particle of energy E in the shower. The angular distribution of the charged particles in the shower is decomposed into the mean\nreduced angle hwi as a function of the particle energy of the charged particle\nand the distribution of reduced angles around the mean reduced angle.\nThe mean reduced angle is found to depend only very weakly on the primary\nparticle energy and is parametrised by\nhwi =\n\n0.435\n\u0013\n111 0.92\n1+\nEMeV\n\n(7)\n\n\u0012\n\nThe mean reduced angle for different primary particle energies as a function\nof the charged particle energy in units of the primary particle energy together\nwith the parametrisation is shown in Fig. 3. There is a good overall agreement\nwithin a few percent between the mean reduced angle from the simulation and\nthe parametrisation, in the range of small kinetic energies compared to the\nprimary particle energy. Fig. 3 right shows the ratio between the simulation\nand the parametrisation. A deviation is seen when the charged particle kinetic\nenergy exceeds about 5% of the primary particle energy (corresponding to a\nred vertical line in fig. 3, right), affecting only a very small fraction of the\nparticles in the shower.\nThe detail modelling of the Cherenkov light distribution in a shower requires\nthe dependency of hwi on the shower age s to be taken into account.

Definition of coordinate system attached to each electron/positron in the\nshower.\n\nThe lateral distribution of the charged particles (electron or positron) in a\nshower are given in a system of coordinates attached to each charged particle\nin the shower as introduced in [10]. The X-direction is defined as the projection\n10\n\n\fof the particle flight direction on the plane perpendicular to the shower axis,\nand the Y direction is perpendicular to it (and therefore perpendicular to\nthe particle velocity) (see fig. 7). The mean particle displacement hxe i with\nrespect to the shower axis along the X axis is non-zero, whereas the average\ndisplacement along the Y axis hye i is zero for symmetry reasons.\nAssuming a factorisation of the expressions of mean displacement and spread\nin terms of energy, particle angle and shower age, the following expressions\nare found to properly describe the particle spread (expressed in units of g \u00d7\ncm\u22122 ) 2 :\nhxe i = 24.3 \u00d7 exp(0.63 \u00d7 log w + 0.025 \u00d7 log2 w)\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u00d7(1 + 0.2 \u00d7 s4.6 ) \u00d7 1 \u2212 exp(\u22120.11 \u00d7 s0.7 )\n21\n2\n\u00d7\n\u00d7 exp(0.47 \u00d7 log EMeV \u2212 0.023 \u00d7 log EMeV\n)\nEMeV\n\n\u03c3xe = 28.7 \u00d7 exp(0.085 \u00d7 log w) \u00d7 (1 + 0.9 \u00d7 w 0.6 )\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u00d7(1 + 0.37 \u00d7 s3.9 ) \u00d7 1 \u2212 exp(\u22120.03 \u00d7 s0.8 )\n21\n2\n\u00d7 exp(0.55 \u00d7 log EMeV \u2212 0.028 \u00d7 log EMeV\n)\n\u00d7\nEMeV\n\nhye i = 0\n\n(13)\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\n\u03c3ye = 2.65 \u00d7 exp(0.03 \u00d7 log w) \u00d7 (1 + 0.51 \u00d7 w 0.5 )\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u00d7(1 + 0.2 \u00d7 s4.5 ) \u00d7 1 \u2212 exp(\u22120.2 \u00d7 s)\n21\n2\n\u00d7\n\u00d7 exp(0.675 \u00d7 log EMeV \u2212 0.035 \u00d7 log EMeV\n)\nEMeV\n\n(16)\n\nThe above expression is a good description of the mean lateral displacement\nand spread at the level of 10%.\nThe reduced variables Xr and Yr are used for simplicity:\nXr =\n\nxe \u2212 hxe i\n,\n\u03c3xe\n\nYr =\n\nye\n\u03c3ye\n\n(17)\n\nwere hxe i, \u03c3xe and \u03c3ye are obtained from eq. 13 to 16.

Distributions of reduced lateral displacement Xr and Yr (eq. 17) for 1 TeV\nshowers, along X and Y axis. As expected, the distribution along Y axis is symmetrical while the distribution along the X axis is not.\n\nThe Yr distributions can be modelled by the following expression:\ndN\nYr2\n= A \u00d7 exp \u22122.5\ndYr\n0.2 + |Yr |1.4\n\n!\n\n(18)\n\nA similar expression can be derived for Xr taking into account the non-centred\nposition of the distribution maximum, and with different coefficients on both\nsides. For the sake of simplicity, a tabulated version of this distribution is used\nin the model production instead of a complicated analytical expression.\nThe dependency of the reduced Xr and Yr lateral distributions with shower age\nand particle angle is shown in fig. 9. The Xr and Yr distributions remain stable\nenough to be considered as independent of these parameters in the shower\nmodelling. The small variation seen in the distribution of Xr with particle\nangle affects mainly particles with a very large angle which are anyhow not\nlikely to reach the telescopes.\nFigure 10 shows that the Xr and Yr distributions are mostly uncorrelated and\ncan therefore be considered as independent.\n\n2\n\nModel Generation\n\nThe semi-analytical description of shower development described in the previous section can be used to construct a shower model, i.e. a prediction of the\nlight distribution on the ground for a given primary particle energy, direction, impact parameter and development depth.

Atmospheric absorption of light, wavelength-dependent quantum\nefficiency and reflectivity used in the model generation are also implemented\nas look-up tables.\n\nFig. 11. Definition of integration range for electron azimuthal angle (see text).\n\nIn practice, for a given set of parameters, the relevant altitude range (in which\nemitted photons can reach the telescope) is first determined. Within this range,\nthe shower development is divided into altitude slices (typically 20 slices). For\neach slice, the total number of charged particles in the shower is computed\nfrom eq. 1, and the particles are distributed in energy bands using eq. 5. For\n15\n\n\feach energy band, the average energy, Cherenkov photon emission angle and\nemission yield (integrated over atmospheric transmission, quantum efficiency\nand dish reflectivity) is derived. The average shower is then further divided into\nflying particle angular bands and lateral displacement (eq. 7 to 18). For each\nconsidered position and direction, the geometric collection efficiency is then\ntaken into account to compute the contribution of this small shower subset.\nAt each calculation step, a precise estimation of the required integration range\nis performed to avoid spending too much time in sampling parts of the shower\nwhose Cherenkov light do not reach the telescope mirror.\nAn example for such a determination (using a geometrical construction) is\nshown in fig. 11: The projection plane (ground) is taken perpendicular to the\nshower axis, which is assumed to intersect the ground at point S. In order to\navoid correlations with electron position and direction, the azimuthal range\nis determined in the shower direction frame (i.e. for a fixed shower and a\ntelescope moving around the shower). The electron, at a fixed altitude z, with\nan energy Ee , is assumed to be at a distance R with an angle \u03b8 from the shower\naxis. Point E in the figure is the projection on the ground of the electron\nposition. Its impact on the ground lies on the circle of radius De = z tan \u03b8\naround the point E. Any Cherenkov photon emitted by this electron (with\nan angle \u03b8c with respect to the electron) will fall within the ring defined by\nthe radii Demin = z tan(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8c ) and Demax = z tan(\u03b8 + \u03b8c ). Intersections of\nthis ring with the possible telescope position (circle centred on S) given the\nallowed azimuthal range [\u03c6min , \u03c6max ]. A similar approach is used to define the\nintegration range for the other variables.\n\n2.2 Parameter space\n\nModels are generated for:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n40 different zenith angles \u03b8z\n40 impact distances ranging from 0 to (400 m)/ cos(\u03b8z ) from telescope\n65 different energies from (50 GeV)/ cos(\u03b8z ) to (20 TeV)/ cos(\u03b8z )\n6 first interaction depths from 0 X0 to 5 X0 .\n\nThe shower images are always generated on-axis (i.e. for a \u03b3-ray at the centre\nof the camera). For a perfect telescope, a change of direction will result in a\nsimple translation in the camera frame, that can be applied later, in the fit\nprocedure. In a more realistic telescope, the broadening of the point spread\nfunction at large off-axis angles needs to be taken into account. This is currently not needed for the H.E.S.S. telescopes, which use a Davis-Cotton optical\ndesign offering a degradation of the PSF from 0.25 mrad (RMS) at the centre\nto \u223c1 mrad at the edge of the field of view, however always smaller than the\n16\n\n\fpixel size[12]. In total, 624000 templates are generated. The model generation\nprocedure requires about 50 to 100 day-machine computing time on recent\ndesktop computers and can be easily parallelled. The resulting shower images\nare stored in a ROOT binary file[13] for later use.\n\n2.3 Example\n\nThe output of the model generation procedure is a bank of two dimensional\nshower images in the frame of a perfect camera, with very small (0.01\u25e6) pixel\nsize. For a given primary particle set of parameters, a predicted image is computed with an interpolation procedure on the generated images in a 4 dimensional space (energy, impact distance, primary interaction depth and zenith\nangle). Shower direction and azimuthal angle are then taken into account as a\nrotation and a translation in the camera frame to compute the final predicted\nimage. Examples of such two dimensional shower images are shown in fig. 12\n\n2.4 Comparison with simulation\n\nA comparison of the image shapes between simulation and model prediction\nis shown in fig. 13 for 1 TeV gamma-ray showers. The images were calculated\nfor a H.E.S.S. camera, with pixels of 0.16\u25e6 diameter. The image length and\nwidth were estimated using the standard Hillas parametrisation applied to the\npredicted images. In each plot, the average value of the simulation is drawn as a\nblack histogram, with error bars indicating the shower-to-shower fluctuations.\nThe model prediction (image of average shower) is represented by a solid thick\nred line.\nThe agreement between the model and the average values of the simulation is\nexcellent up to core distance of about 300 m, where some trigger effects can\nexplain the differences: at this distance, the total image amplitude does not\nexceed 100 photoelectrons, distributed over many pixels. Showers fluctuating\nup to higher intensities are more likely to trigger the telescope, thus resulting\nin a higher average image amplitude in the simulation compared to the model.\nThe bars in the simulation histograms (in black) are due to shower-to-shower\nfluctuations, which are not taken into account in the model generation. At\nsmall core distance, and when taking into account the evolution with primary\ninteraction depth, the shower intensity fluctuates by about 20% from shower\nto shower in addition to the fluctuation related to the depth of first interaction.\n17\n\n\f6\n\n6\n\n\u00d710\n\n\u00d710\n\n100\n\n100\n\n80\n\n80\n\n60\n\n60\n\n40\n\n40\n\n20\n\n20\n\n0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n-0\n2.5 3\n-0.2\n1.5 2\n1\n-0.4\n0.5\n-0.6\n0\n-0.8 -1 -0.5\n\n6\n\n3\n\n\u00d710\n\n140\n\n6000\n\n\u00d710\n\n120\n\n5000\n\n100\n\n4000\n\n80\n\n3000\n\n60\n\n2000\n\n40\n\n1000\n\n20\n\n0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n-0\n2.5 3\n-0.2\n1.5 2\n1\n-0.4\n0.5\n-0.6\n0\n-0.8 -1 -0.5\n\n0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n-0\n2.5 3\n-0.2\n1.5 2\n1\n-0.4\n0.5\n-0.6\n0\n-0.8 -1 -0.5\n\n-0\n2.5 3\n-0.2\n1.5 2\n1\n-0.4\n0.5\n-0.6\n0\n-0.8 -1 -0.5\n\nFig. 12.

The key ingredients in the model generation are the inclusion of\ndepth of first interaction as shower parameter (as the main source of shower-toshower fluctuations), and the precise description of longitudinal, lateral, and\nangular distributions of charged particles in the shower. The corresponding\nshower model is constructed once for all and can be applied to various zenith\nangles, telescope impact distance or off-axis angle.\nAn alternate brute force approach would be the generation of the shower im18\n\n\fAmplitude (\u03c1 \u2264 80)\n\nAmplitude (\u03c1 \u2264 80)\n\n3\n\n10\n\n5500\n5000\n4500\n4000\n3500\n\n102\n\n3000\n2500\n2000\n1500\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n1000\n0\n\n300\n350\n400\nTrue Impact Distance\n\n0.008\n\nNominal Distance\n\nImage Length and Width\n\n0\n\n0.007\n0.006\n\nLength\n0.005\n0.004\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n4\nPrimary Depth\n\n0.04\n0.035\n0.03\n0.025\n0.02\n\n0.003\n\n0.015\n\nWidth\n0.002\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n\n0.005\n\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n0\n0\n\n250\n300\n350\nTrue Impact Distance\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n300\n350\nTrue Impact Distance\n\nFig. 13.

The model prediction is represented by a solid\nthick red line.\n\nage model from massive simulations performed at every energy, zenith angle,\nimpact distance, off-axis angle and primary interaction depth. The size of the\nparameter space and the need for a smooth model (in order to avoid local minima that would hamper the quality of the fit procedure) makes this approach\nless effective that the generation of an intrinsically smooth shower model.\n\n3\n\nFit procedure\n\nOnce a shower model has been obtained, actual images on the camera can\nbe compared to the ones predicted by the shower image model for a given\nset of primary parameters. A minimisation procedure is then used to obtain\nthe most likely parameters of the incoming particle (energy, direction, impact,\ndepth of the first interaction) under the hypothesis that the particle is a \u03b3-ray.\n19\n\n\fThe minimisation procedure involves a precise comparison of the intensity in\neach pixel of the camera with the prediction from the model (interpolated\nbetween grid points to the actual set of parameters). In order to take into\naccount the Poisson nature of the detected number of photons in each pixel,\na log-likelihood approach has been chosen.\n\n3.1 Pedestal and calibration\n\nIn the absence of Cherenkov light, each pixel of the H.E.S.S. camera is illuminated by a significant amount of Night Sky Background (NSB) light, which\nlargely dominates over the electronic noise and represents a single photoelectron rate ranging from 40 MHz off the galactic plane to \u223c 300 MHz in the\nmost luminous parts of the galactic plane. The pedestal is defined for each\npixel as the charge distribution collected in the absence of Cherenkov signal.\nIt is determined[14] for each pixel and for each observation run, using a cleaning procedure that identifies the position of the shower image in the camera\nand rejects the corresponding pixels. The pedestal width is the combination\nof the electronic noise and the night sky background, the later being largely\ndominant. Due to varying atmospheric conditions, rotation of the sky on the\ncamera 3 and instrumental effects that depend on particular on temperature,\nthe pedestal position and width can vary with time, with timescales of the\norder of a few minutes. The evolution of pedestal position and width with\ntime for each pixel is recorded for every observation run and used during the\nreconstruction describe below.\n\n3.2 Pixel log-likelihood\n\nThe shower image model provides a density of Cherenkov light in the focal\nplane. A convolution by the pixel size is done when loading the model to\ncompute the expected signal \u03bc in each pixel. For the sake of simplicity, the\ndependence of the PSF across the field of view is not taken into account in\nthis calculation. The probability density (likelihood) to observe a signal of s\n(in units of photoelectron) in a pixel for an expectation value \u03bc is given by the\nconvolution of the Poisson distribution of the photoelectron number n with\nthe photomultiplier\nresolution. The latter is well represented by a Gaussian of\nq\n2\n2\nwidth \u03c3p + n\u03c3\u03b3 where \u03c3p is the width of the pedestal (charge distribution\nunder pure noise, including night sky background) and \u03c3\u03b3 the width of the\n3\n\nThe H.E.S.S. telescope use a Alt-Az mount\n\n20\n\n\fsingle photoelectron peak (photomultiplier resolution):\n\nP (s|\u03bc, \u03c3p , \u03c3\u03b3 ) =\n\nX\nn\n\n(s \u2212 n)2\nq\nexp \u2212\n2(\u03c3p2 + n\u03c3\u03b32 )\nn! 2\u03c0(\u03c3p2 + n\u03c3\u03b32 )\n\u03bcn e\u2212\u03bc\n\n!\n\n(21)\n\nIn eq. 21, the actual pedestal width \u03c3p is different for each pixel, and depends\nin particular on the level of night sky background (NSB) seen by the pixel.\nThe photoelectron resolution \u03c3\u03b3 , also specific to each pixel, is measured using\ncalibration runs where the camera is illuminated with a low intensity flashing\nLED. The use of measured values of \u03c3p and \u03c3\u03b3 is an important aspect that will\nexplain the stability of the Model Analysis for varying level of NSB (Section\n4.12).\n\nP(x|\u03bc )\n\nPedestal\n\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n\nSingle P.E.\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\nGaussian\nRegime\n\n0\n10\ns [p.e.] 8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n7\n8\n9 e.]\n10 [p.\n\u03bc\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nFig. 14.

For low\npredicted or detected intensity, the simple Gaussian assumption (as used in a \u03c72\ntest) is not valid anymore.\n\nThe shape of function 21 is shown in fig. 14. In order to obtain a variable that\nbehaves asymptotically like a \u03c72 , we define the pixel log-likelihood\nln L = \u22122 \u00d7 ln P (s|\u03bc, \u03c3p, \u03c3\u03b3 )\n\n(22)\n\n21\n\n\f3.3 Pixel log-likelihood expectation values\nIn order to compare the observed signal s with a model prediction \u03bc, the expectation value of the log-likelihood under different realisations of the same\nshower image (i.e. \u03bc being fixed and s fluctuating due to Poisson noise, electronic and NSB fluctuations) needs to be computed. If the observed signal is\nonly due to noise (night sky background), the probability density functions\nsimplifies to a Gaussian of width \u03c3p . In this case, the average value of the pixel\nlog-likelihood reads\nhln Li |\u03bc=0 =\n\nZ\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nds ln L(s|\u03bc = 0, \u03c3p ) \u00d7 P (s|\u03bc = 0, \u03c3p )\nds ln(2\u03c0) +\n\nln \u03c3p2\n\ns2\n+ 2\n\u03c3p\n\n= 1 + ln(2\u03c0) + ln \u03c3p2\n\n!\n\ns2\nq\nexp \u2212 2\n2\u03c3p\n2\u03c0\u03c3p2\n1\n\n!\n\n(23)\n\nIn a similar manner, one obtains\nD\n\nE\n\n\u0010\n\nln2 L = 1 + ln(2\u03c0) + ln \u03c3p2\n\n\u00112\n\n+2\n\n=\u21d2\n\n\u03c3 2 (ln L) = 2\n\n(24)\n\nAt high \u03bc, the Poisson distribution can be replaced by a Gaussian of width\n\u221a\n\u03bc, and the probability density function can be well approximated by the\nconvolution of two Gaussian:\n\uf8eb\n\n1\n\n(s \u2212 \u03bc)2\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8ed\n\u0011\uf8f8\nP (s|\u03bc \u226b 0, \u03c3p , \u03c3\u03b3 ) \u2248 r \u0010\n\u0011 exp \u2212 \u0010 2\n2)\n2\n\u03c3\n+\n\u03bc(1\n+\n\u03c3\n2\n2\np\n\u03b3\n2\u03c0 \u03c3p + \u03bc(1 + \u03c3\u03b3 )\n\nIn this limit, the log-likelihood behaves like a \u03c72 :\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nhln Li |\u03bc = 1 + ln(2\u03c0) + ln \u03c3p2 + \u03bc(1 + \u03c3\u03b32 ) ,\n\n\u03c3 2 (ln L) = 2\n\n(25)\n\nThis expression reduces to eq. 23 when \u03bc = 0.

A minimisation procedure is used to find the best parameters\n23\n\n\f(direction, impact, depth of the first interaction and energy). In contrast to\nHillas parameters based reconstruction techniques, the raw image amplitudes\nare directly used, without any image cleaning procedure. All pixels are used\nin the fit, not only those close to the actual image.\nA Levenberg-Marquardt fit algorithm [15,16] is used to minimise the telescope\nlog-likelihood (eq. 26). This algorithm is very efficient in the case the first and\nsecond derivative of the minimised function (log-likelihood or \u03c72 ) can be expressed analytically and depend mostly on the first derivative of the model (the\nsecond derivative being negligible). This is in general valid when the minimised\nfunction is a quadratic form (\u03c72 or similar) and when the model function exhibits a smooth behaviour when varying the model parameters. The algorithm\nassumes a quadratic form and uses the inverse matrix of second derivatives\nto estimate the position of the minimum. In order to improve convergence\nstability, a combination of pure steepest descent and parabolic assumption is\nused with weights that vary during the minimisation, depending on whether\nthe quadratic assumption is valid or not. The Levenberg-Marquardt fit algorithm always converges - sometimes to a local minimum - and provides reliable\nestimates of the model parameters uncertainties, taken from the correlation\nmatrix.\nAn important issue in the fit algorithm is the starting point. The standard\nHillas reconstruction technique[17] with different sets of image cleaning parameters is used to derive a handful of possible estimates. The estimate that\nprovides the best initial log-likelihood is chosen as starting point of the minimisation.\nIn our case, about 40 iterations are needed for the algorithm to converge,\nwhereas simpler algorithms such as Minuit[18] needed in average about ten\ntimes more. On recent desktop computers, the reconstruction of a single event\ntakes about 50 to 100 ms.\nThe actual telescope reflectivity, as measured from ring-shape images of muons\npassing through the telescope[14], is used to scale the model prediction to\nthe observation conditions, on a run-by-run basis. Since the optical efficiency\nis taken into account directly at the reconstruction level, no further energy\ncorrection is needed (which is completely different to the way the optical\nefficiency is handled in Hillas parameters based analyses).\nThe output of the minimisation procedure are:\n\u2022 Best guess of the 6 shower parameters: direction (2 parameters), impact (2\nparameters), depth of the first interaction and energy\n\u2022 Correlation matrix and therefore uncertainty on these best fit parameters\n\u2022 Final log-likelihood value\n24\n\n\f3.6 Goodness of fit\nSince Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes are background dominated systems,\nthe performance of any analysis is mainly driven by its ability to discriminate\nbetween gamma-ray induced showers and the much more numerous hadronic\nbackground. In the Model Analysis, a goodness-of-fit approach is chosen to\ncompare the model prediction and the actual shower images, in order to check\nthe compatibility of the recorded events with a pure \u03b3-ray hypothesis. The\ngoodness-of-fit is defined as a normalised sum over all pixels of the difference\nbetween the actual pixel log-likelihood and its expectation value, properly\nnormalised:\n\nG=\n\nX h\n\npixel i\n\nln L(si |\u03bci ) \u2212 hln Li |\u03bci\n\u221a\n\ni\n\n2 \u00d7 NdF\n\n(27)\n\nwhere NdF is the number of degrees of freedom (number of pixels - 6). The\ngoodness of fit behaves asymptotically like a \u03c72 and provides therefore a measure of the fit quality. This will be used later on the hadronic discrimination.\nBy construction, if the pixels likelihood behave like independent random variables, G is expected to behave like a normal variable:\nhGi = 0 and \u03c3 2 (G) = 1\n\n(28)\n\n3.7 Goodness of fit calibration\nThe goodness of fit average value relies on the assumption of a Gaussian\npedestal (of width \u03c3p ). In the absence of night sky background, the pedestal\nreduces to the electronic noise and the assumption is always valid[14]. The\nH.E.S.S. camera use two different gains: a high gain, with dynamical range\nfrom 0 to 200 photoelectrons with single photoelectron resolution and an electronic noise representing about 0.2 p.e., and a low gain, with dynamical range\nup to 2000 photoelectrons but worse resolution. In the low gain, where the\nelectronic noise represents about 2.5 p.e., the pedestal is also Gaussian to a\ngood approximation.\nIn the high gain channel, figure 16, reproduced from [14], shows that the Gaussian assumption is also almost valid for high night sky background (above\n\u223c 150 MHz), but not in the intermediate regime where the pedestal shape exhibits two peaks, similar to a single photoelectron spectrum, and produced by\nfractions of single photoelectron pulses falling by chance within the acquisition\nwindow.\n25\n\n\fNumber of events\n\n250\n\nwithout NSB\n8\nNSB ~ 0.5 * 10 Hz\n8\nNSB ~ 1.1 * 10 Hz\n8\nNSB ~ 1.4 * 10 Hz\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\n-12300 -12200 -12100 -12000 -11900 -11800 -11700 -11600 -11500 -11400\n\nADC counts\n\nFig. 16.

Average value of goodness-of-fit per telescope as function of night sky\nbackground level, and as obtained from simulations, before (left) and after (right)\ngoodness calibration.\n\nThe goodness of fit calculated with low gain channels on each pixel appears\nto be rather stable with night sky background, thus confirming the validity\nof the Gaussian assumption for this channel. In contrast, the goodness of fit\ncalculated with high gain channels exhibit a strong deviation at low night sky\n26\n\n\fbackground level, where the pedestal is not Gaussian anymore. Simulations\nwere used to derive a correction table as function of night sky background\nlevel in each pixel independently. This table is not used during the reconstruction, and is only applied to the final goodness of fit estimator. The resulting\ngoodness-of-fit is shown in fig. 17, before correction (left) and after correction\n(right). After calibration, the goodness-of-fit is stable for a night sky background variation from 10 to 200 MHz, which corresponds the bulk of the\nH.E.S.S. observations.\n\n3.8 ShowerGoodness and BackgroundGoodness\nThe discrimination between \u03b3-ray induced showers and hadron induced ones\ncan use several distinct features (fig. 18):\n\u2022 Hadron induced showers are more irregular, and contain several electromagnetic sub-showers initiated in particular by disintegration of neutral pions.\nAs a consequence, the image in a Cherenkov camera often exhibits several\nclusters separated apart (fig. 18, left)\n\u2022 In addition, the hadronic component of the shower itself emits a low intensity Cherenkov light spread over a large fraction of the camera. This\nemission, denoted as Hadronic rain, is in general eliminated by cleaning\nprocedures used in standard reconstruction techniques. (fig. 18, middle).\n\u2022 Finally, the charged nucleus entering the atmosphere can emit a Cherenkov\nlight before interacting. This emission is produced very high in the atmosphere and therefore it generates, in the camera, a faint spot close to the\nshower direction.\n\nFig. 18. Examples of image topologies that can discriminate between a \u03b3-ray induced\nshowers and an hadronic one. Left: image subdivided in several clusters corresponding to electromagnetic sub-showers. Middle: hadronic rain emitted by the hadronic\ncomponent of the shower. Right: Cherenkov emission from the primary particle (nucleus) entering the atmosphere, before the actual shower development. The red cross\ndenotes the centre of the camera.\n\nIn order to fully exploit the differences between the \u03b3 and hadron induced\nshowers, individual pixels contributing to the goodness-of-fit (eq. 27) are clas27\n\n\fsified into two different groups at the end of the fit:\n\u2022 Pixels belonging to the shower core, defined as pixels whose predicted amplitude is above 0.01 p.e., are grouped together with three rows of neighbours\naround them to construct a variable named ShowerGoodness (SG) in a similar way to eq. 27. These pixels are selected at the end of the fit procedure\nto avoid changes of the number of degrees of freedom during the fit. Due to\nthe large reduction of the number of degrees freedom, this variable is more\nsensitive than the Goodness to discrepancies between the model prediction\nand the actual shower images.\n\u2022 Remaining pixels, denoted as background pixels, are grouped together to\nconstruct a variable named BackgroundGoodness (BG), which is sensitive\nto hadronic clusters outside the main image, hadronic rains and other irregularities.\n\n4\n\nResults\n\n4.1 Data sets\n\nFor a detailed comparison of the Model Analysis with previously existing\nreconstruction techniques, two data sets are used:\n\u2022 A data set (PKS Flare) of 7.7 hours (live time) of data taken on the blazar\nPKS 2155-304 during flaring period in July 2006, with 4 telescopes, yielding a test sample of more than 10 000 \u03b3-rays with very small background\ncontamination, at relatively low zenith angles (typically 20\u25e6 ). The average\nnight sky background for this data set corresponds to a single pixel triggering rate of 40 MHz, representative for extragalactic space. Since the data\nhas been taken within 3 days, the system state can be considered as stable.\n\u2022 A large set (Crab Full) of \u223c 34 hours (live time) of data taken on the Crab\nNebula, from 2004 to 2008, with 4 telescopes and larger zenith angles (from\n40\u25e6 to 60\u25e6 ). This data set yields a sample of \u223c 10 000 excess events. The\naverage NSB for this data set, representative for galactic plane, is more than\ntwice higher (\u223c 100 MHz) than for extragalactic space.\nThe model analysis will be compared to the standard Hillas parameters based\nreconstruction in use in the H.E.S.S. collaboration[17]. Two sets of cuts will\nbe defined: Hillas 60 will denote a minimum image amplitude of 60 photoelectrons (p.e.), same as for the Model Analysis, and Hillas 200 will use a\nlarger minimum image amplitude of 200 p.e.. When needed, Hillas Std and\nHillas Hard will denote configurations used in the Crab publication[17] with\nrespectively 80 and 200 p.e. minimal image amplitude.\n28\n\n\f4.2 Shape cuts\nIn order to have well reconstructed showers, the following shape cuts are used\nthroughout the current section (unless specified differently):\n\u2022 A minimum image amplitude of 60 photoelectrons per telescope.\n\u2022 A maximal nominal distance (distance of the shower image centre to the\ncentre of the camera) of 2\u25e6 for a camera radius of 2.5\u25e6 . The nominal distance\ncut removes truncated images, close to the camera edge, that often lead to\nmisreconstruction of shower direction.\n\u2022 At least images from two different telescopes passing the previous cuts to\nensure stereoscopic reconstruction.\nThese cuts will be used both for the Model Analysis and for the Hillas parameters based reconstruction techniques. The later needs an additional cleaning\nprocedure. We use a two-level filter cleaning[17] with pixel thresholds of respectively 5 and 10 p.e.. The image amplitude is computed after cleaning. The\nModel Analysis doesn't require any cleaning procedure, so the image amplitude for the model photon reconstruction is slightly larger than for the Hillas\nanalysis (as pixels belonging to the shower image tail are taken into account\nfor the model reconstruction and not for the Hillas reconstruction).\n\n\u03b3 Efficiency\n\n#events\n\n4.3 Hadron discrimination\n\n1200\nPKS 2155-304 (ON-OFF)\n\n1000\n\nMonte Carlo (\u03b3 ) - NSB 40 MHz\n\n1\n\n10-1\n\nBackground (OFF)\n\n800\n\n10-2\n\n600\n400\n\nThis Work\n\n10-3\n200\n0\n-2\n\nHillas 60\n-4\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n10\n\n6\n8\nShower Goodness\n\n10-4\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10-2\n\n10-1\n1\nBackground Efficiency\n\nFig. 19.

Right: \u03b3-ray efficiency as function of background rejection for a selection\nbased on Shower Goodness, compared with selection achieved in a standard Hillas\nparameters reconstruction at the same minimum image amplitude (60 p.e.) and\nwith the Mean Scaled Width and Mean Scaled Length variables.\n\nThe distribution of ShowerGoodness (SG) in the shape cuts of section 4.2 is\nshown in fig. 19 for the data taken on the blazar PKS 2155-304, and for a\n29\n\n\fsimulation with 40 MHz of night sky background noise, corresponding to the\naverage night sky luminosity around PKS 2155-304. The Monte Carlo distribution (red line) and the distribution for the PKS 2155-304 excess events\n(blue filled circles) are in overall good agreement, and are very different from\nthe distribution obtained for background events (grey triangles), thus confirming the discrimination capabilities of the ShowerGoodness variable. The\nsmall shift between the two distribution is responsible for a systematic error\nin acceptance determination of 4% for a cut at SG \u2264 0.6.\nFig. 19, right, shows the \u03b3-ray efficiency as function of background rejection\nfor a selection based on ShowerGoodness only 4 , after shape cuts, compared\nto what is achieved in the standard Hillas parameters based reconstruction\n(at the same minimal image amplitude, and using the Mean Scaled Width\nas varying selection variable). A large squared angular distance cut of \u03b82 \u2264\n0.04 deg2 was used to ensure that all events are accepted (extended source\nassumption) and to decorrelate angular resolution performance(sec. 4.8) from\nhadronic discrimination. The model reconstruction provides, for a given \u03b3-ray\nefficiency, a much better background rejection than Hillas parameters based\nreconstruction. Moreover, as will be shown in the following sections, the Model\nAnalysis provides additional discriminating variables that improve further the\nsensitivity.\nIn the standard configuration of the Model Analysis, a cut ShowerGoodness\nSG \u2264 0.6 will be used as main discriminating parameter. This cut retains 70%\nof \u03b3-rays and rejects more than 95% of background events, yielding a quality\nfactor\nQ= \u221a\n\n\u01eb\u03b3\n\u01ebhadrons\n\n\u22484\n\n(29)\n\n4.4 Primary interaction reconstruction\nThe depth of the first interaction being a parameter of the model, is also a\ndirect product of the reconstruction procedure (instead of being calculated,\nas in the Hillas parameters based reconstruction, from the shower maximum).\nFig. 20 shows the ability of the Model Analysis to reconstruct the depth of the\nfirst interaction with almost no bias and a resolution of 0.7 X0 (slightly worse\nat large zenith angles). This is better than Hillas parameters based analyses,\nwhich obtain resolution not better than 1 X0 in the best cases.\nA comparison of the actual depth of the first interaction obtained with real\ndata and with simulation is shown in fig. 21, in shape cuts and SG \u2264 0.6,\n4\n\nseveral other variables, described later in this paper, can provide additional rejection\n\n30\n\n\f4\n\n120\n\n3\n\n100\n\n0\n\n140\n\n5\n\nPrimary Depth [X ]\n\n0\n\nPrimary Depth [X ]\n\n\u03c7 2 / ndf\n\n5\n\n0.1769 / 40\n\np0\n\n0.09277 \u00b1 0.20139\n\np1\n\n0.9323 \u00b1 0.0800\n\n4\n3\n\n80\n2\n\n2\n60\n\n1\n\n1\n\n40\n0\n\n0\n\n20\n\n-10\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5\nTrue Primary Depth [X ]\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5\nTrue Primary Depth [X ]\n0\n\n0\n\nFig. 20.

The agreement between the\nsimulation and the actual data is very good.\n\nunder a point-like source assumption (squared angular distance cut of \u03b82 \u2264\n0.01 deg2 ). The agreement between data and simulations is excellent. The\nPKS 2155-304 data are compatible with a 0.7 X0 resolution, and the Crab data\nwith a slightly worse (0.9 X0 ) resolution due to a larger average zenith angle.\nMoreover, since the distribution for OFF data is significantly different, the\ndepth of the first interaction can be used to improve the \u03b3-hadron separation.\nThe irregularities in the OFF distributions are artifacts of the reconstruction\nprocedure: models are only available for depths of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 X0 and\nare linearly interpolated between these values (and extrapolated above 5 X0 ).\nPoorly constrained showers tend to accumulate at the grid model points and\navoid interpolated values.\n31\n\n\f#events\n\nIn order to improve \u03b3-background separation, a cut in reconstructed primary\ninteraction depth \u22121X0 \u2264 t0 \u2264 4X0 is used. This cut retains 90% of \u03b3-rays\n(resp.91%) and rejects 30% of hadrons (resp. 25%) , yielding a quality factor\nQ = 1.07 (resp. 1.06) respectively for the Crab and PKS 2155-304 data sets,\nleading to an improvement of the signal over background ratio by about 20%.\n\n1600\n\nElectrons (MC)\n\n1400\n\nGammas (MC)\n\n1200\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n5\n6\nPrimary Depth [X ]\n0\n\nFig. 22. Distribution of the depth of the first interaction for a \u03b3-ray spectrum of\ndifferential index 2.6 at zenith (in red) compared to electrons with same spectrum\n(in blue): electron induced showers start to emit Cherenkov light a little bit earlier\nin the atmosphere.\n\nAt low energies, the electron background becomes dominant for atmospheric\nCherenkov telescopes. It is usually considered as irreducible, since electron\ninduced showers are almost identical to \u03b3-ray induced one. However, electron\ninduced showers start to produce Cherenkov light a little bit earlier in the\natmosphere (about a radiation length before \u03b3). This is confirmed by simulation shown in fig. 22: the distribution of reconstructed primary depth for a\nsimulated electrons spectrum shows a peaks centred around 0 X0 , earlier than\nfor \u03b3's. The difference is not big enough to distinguish between electrons and\ngammas on an event by event basis, but a statistical discrimination seems to\nbe possible.\n\n4.5 Analysis Configurations\n\nThe \u03b3-hadron separation is essentially based on the ShowerGoodness and primary interaction depth variables. For completeness, two additional cuts are\nused: a cut on BackgroundGoodness (BG \u2264 2), with \u03b3-ray efficiency close\nto 100%, is designed to remove a small number of shower misreconstructed\nat very large distance from the camera centre (4 degrees or more). A second\ncut on the Goodness (G) variable (eq. 27), in which the model is replaced\nby a null (\u03bc = 0) assumption, removes images that are consistent with pure\nnight sky background noise, and reduces the effect of night sky background\ninhomogeneities across the field of view.\n32\n\n\fThe standard cuts for the Model Analysis are defined as:\n\u2022 A minimum image amplitude of 60 photoelectrons per telescope\n\u2022 A maximal nominal distance (distance of the shower image centre to the\ncentre of the camera) not more than 2\u25e6\n\u2022 At least two telescopes passing the previous shape cuts\n\u2022 A maximum ShowerGoodness (SG) of 0.6\n\u2022 A reconstructed primary interaction depth t0 between -1 and 4 X0 .\n\u2022 For a point-like source, a squared angular distance cut of \u03b82 \u2264 0.01 deg2 ,\nindependent of zenith angle 5\nTwo additional sets of cuts are defined as reference point for future H.E.S.S.\npublications: the Faint source configuration is optimised for source fainter than\na few percent of the Crab flux. The Loose cuts configuration is designed to\nmaximise the \u03b3-ray efficiency for strong sources at the expense of a poorer\nbackground rejection. For analysis of extended source, the \u03b82 cut is usually\nreplaced by a selection that encompasses the whole source.

The reconstruction efficiency for the standard configuration\nis similar to the values obtained with Hillas reconstruction with a minimum\n5\n\nSince the angular resolution degrades at large zenith angle, a varying cut could\nperform better.

Effective area as function of energy, at zenith, compared with the values\nobtained for the standard and hard cuts Hillas parameters based analyses.\n\nimage amplitude of 60 p.e.. As expected, the loose configuration has a larger\neffective area and a lower threshold. In most of the H.E.S.S. publications so\nfar, a minimum image amplitude of 200 p.e. was used, yielding a much larger\nthreshold of \u223c 300 GeV at zenith. Models are currently generated only up\nto 20 TeV, thus leading to a loss of acceptance at high energy. In addition,\nshowers above 10 TeV can reach the ground, resulting into large fluctuations\nthat are not fully reproduced by the model.\nPerformances obtained on the Crab Nebula and on the Blazar PKS 2155-304\nare shown in tab. 2. The Model Analysis yields a \u03b3-ray efficiency similar to\nthe 60 p.e. Hillas reconstruction, but with a background rejection improved\nby a factor of 6.2 (PKS 2155-304) to 6.8 (Crab Nebular), yielding a signal\nover background ratio similar or better to the one obtained with hard cuts\nHillas reconstruction. As a result, the significance obtained with the Model\nreconstruction is larger, and the sensitivity improved by a factor of more than\n2. The faint source configuration provides an additional factor of \u223c 2 in S/B\ncompared to standard configuration.\n\n4.7 Energy resolution\nThe energy resolution (in cuts) as function of energy is shown in fig. 24 for\nzenith, where the energy resolution is defined as the RMS of the \u2206E/E distri34\n\n\fData Set\n\nAnalysis\n\nON\n\nOFF\n\n1/\u03b1\n\n\u03b3\n\n\u03c3\n\nS/B\n\nCrab Full\n\nHillas 60\n\n12768\n\n26154\n\n16.2\n\n11148.6\n\n162.6\n\n6.9\n\nCrab Full\n\nHillas 200\n\n3742\n\n1435\n\n16.9\n\n3657.1\n\n125.0\n\n43.1\n\nCrab Full\n\nModel Std\n\n10249\n\n3848\n\n18.2\n\n10037\n\n210.7\n\n47.3\n\nCrab Full\n\nModel Faint\n\n5920\n\n1605\n\n25.8\n\n5857.7\n\n176.8\n\n94.0\n\nCrab Full\n\nModel Loose\n\n20107\n\n22137\n\n16.7\n\n18782.3\n\n244.3\n\n14.2\n\nPKS Flare\n\nHillas 60\n\n24964\n\n7025\n\n10.9\n\n24320.4\n\n302.1\n\n37.8\n\nPKS Flare\n\nHillas 200\n\n5148\n\n490\n\n12.7\n\n5109.3\n\n153.9\n\n132.1\n\nPKS Flare\n\nModel Std\n\n24388\n\n1303\n\n12.7\n\n24285.4\n\n342.9\n\n236.7\n\nPKS Flare\n\nModel Faint\n\n11047\n\n427\n\n18.1\n\n11023.4\n\n248.1\n\n466.5\n\nPKS Flare\n\nModel Loose\n\n38308\n\n3676\n\n11.0\n\n37972.7\n\n407.2\n\n113\n\nTable 2\nNumber of excess events and significances obtained with the Model Analysis on\nsome H.E.S.S. sources compared to standard reconstruction techniques. The published results on the Crab Nebula[17] where obtained with a minimum image amplitude of 80 photoelectrons, yielding a better S/B ratio than results obtained with\na 60 pe cut, although with similar significance.\n\nbution. The energy resolution is better than 15% for the whole energy range\n(from 80 GeV up to more than 20 TeV), with biases not exceeding 5% in the\ncentral range. The very central energy range (500 GeV to more than 10 TeV),\nthe energy resolution is better than 10% and reaches values as low as 7 to 8%.\nLarger energy biases appear at very low energy (up to 20% at 80 GeV), due to\ntrigger selection effects. These biases are however smaller than those obtained\nwith an Hillas parameters based reconstruction. In a similar manner, negative\nenergy biases appear at very high energies, due to very distant high energy\nshowers reconstructed closer to the telescopes 6 and with an underestimated\nenergy. In the medium energy range (500 GeV to a few 10 TeV), the Model\nAnalysis largely outperforms standard reconstruction techniques.\n\n4.8 Angular resolution\nThe angular resolution, defined as the 68% containment radius, is shown in\nfig. 25 for showers at zenith (left), and is of the order of 0.06\u25e6 in most of the\nenergy range, which is much better than values obtained with Hillas parameters based analyses (using algorithm 1 from [19]) for similar minimal image\n6\n\nVery distant shower produce almost parallel images in the camera, which introduces a degeneracy in the reconstruction.\n\n35\n\n\fBias\n\nResolution\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n\n0.25\n\n0\n-0.1\n\n0.2\n\n-0.2\n-0.3\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n10\n\nE [TeV]\n\n0.15\n\n0.1\n\nModel Std\n0.05\n\nHillas 60\nHillas 200\n\n0\n\n10-1\n\n1\n\n10\n\nE [TeV]\n\nFig. 24.

This can be used to select\nin a simple and natural way a sub-sample of the events with improved angular\nor energy resolution (for more precise morphological or spectral analysis).\nAn example of such a subset selection is shown in fig. 28, where an additional\nselection on the energy uncertainty d ln E \u2264 0.04 is applied to the data.

Effect of an additional selection on the energy uncertainty d ln E \u2264 0.04 on\nthe energy resolution (left) and effective area (right).\n\nIn a similar manner, fig. 29 shows the effect of an additional selection on the\ndirection uncertainty dDir \u2264 0.03\u25e6 on the angular resolution. It is possible to\nachieve a resolution as good as 0.03\u25e6 in the TeV energy range at the expense\nof a factor less than 2 in statistics. This can greatly improve the ability to pinpoint the source position in challenging regions such as the Galactic Centre.\nThis is demonstrated in fig. 30, where the same selection dDir \u2264 0.03\u25e6 is\napplied to data from PKS 2155-304. The net result of the selection is an\nunprecedented resolution \u03c368 = 0.055 and \u03c395 = 0.1 with number of excess\nevent being still around 10000 \u03b3. The background is also much more suppressed\nthan the signal, resulting into a S/B ratio of 454 compared to 236 before\nselection. The direction uncertainty could therefore serve as an additional\ndiscriminating parameter, but its effect would not be independent of energy.\n38\n\n\fEffective Area [m2]\n\nResolution (degrees)\n\n0.2\n0.18\n0.16\n0.14\n\nStd Cut\n\n0.12\n\nImproved (dDir \u2264 0.03 )\no\n\n0.1\n\n106\n\n105\n\n104\n\nTrigger\n\n0.08\n0.06\n\nStd Cuts\no\nImproved (dDir \u2264 0.03 )\n\n3\n\n10\n0.04\n0.02\n0\n\n10-1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10-1\n\nE [TeV]\n\n1\n\n10\nE [TeV]\n\n1800\n1600\n1400\n1200\n1000\n\n95 %\n\n3000\n\n95 %\n\n4000\n\n2000\n\n68 %\n\nNumber of events\n\n5000\n\n68 %\n\nNumber of events\n\nFig. 29.

The games of combining several analyses appears therefore not as promising as it was, when using a older version\nof the Model Analyis with less performance.\n39\n\n\f#events\n\n#events\n\n4000\nPKS 2155-304 (ON-OFF)\n\n3500\n\n4000\nPKS 2155-304 (ON-OFF)\n\n3500\n\nBackground (OFF)\n\n3000\n2500\n\n2000\n\n1500\n\n1500\n\n1000\n\n1000\n\n500\n\n500\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nBackground in SG \u2264 0.6 cut\n\n2500\n\n2000\n\n0\n-3\n\nBackground (OFF)\n\n3000\nBackground in SG \u2264 0.6 cut\n\n0\n-3\n\n3\n4\n5\nMean Scaled Width\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n4\n5\nMean Scaled Length\n\nFig. 31.

All histograms are\nnormalised to the same number of events.\n\n4.11 Sensitivity to stars and broken pixels\n\nDuring H.E.S.S. observations, camera pixels illuminated by a bright star are\nturned off to avoid damage to the photocathode. In addition, some (in general less than 5%) pixels are removed from the analysis due to instrumental\nmalfunction (non working high voltage, noisy pixel, badly behaving analogue\nmemory, ...). Missing pixels affect more Hillas parameters based analyses (as\nthey produce truncated images) than the Model Analysis, which just ignores\nthe missing pixels.\nThe effect of bright stars is demonstrated in fig. 32, where the large Crab\nNebula data set (32 live hours) was used to produce a significance map using\nthe template model[22]. A bright star, \u03b6-Tauri of visual magnitude 2.97, is\npresent in the field of view. On average, about three to four pixels surrounding\nthe star are turned off during observations. An artificial excess of events, up to\nthe level of 8\u03c3, is visible in the Hillas Analysis significance map. This excess\nis due to a deficit in background events which translates into an artificial\nexcess of events. The Model Analysis significance map shows no deviation at\nthe same position, demonstrating that it is less sensitive to missing pixels.\nThe artifact in the Hillas Analysis significance map weakens at larger minimal\nimage amplitude (200 p.e.) as the shower images in the camera become larger\nand are therefore less affected by a few missing pixels.\n\n4.12 Sensitivity to varying night sky background\n\nThe evolution of Shower Goodness distribution for simulated \u03b3-rays (with\nphoton index 2.0 at zenith) is shown in fig. 33. No strong evolution is seen\nup to 300 MHz. The bulk of the HESS observations correspond to an average\n40\n\n\fSignificance Distribution - Hillas 60\n\nSignificance Map - Hillas 60\nDec (deg)\n\n20\n\n\u03c7 2 / ndf\n\n667.3 / 80\n1562 \u00b1 10.9\n\nConstant\n\n23.5\n\n3\n\n10\n\nMean\n\n15\n\n23\n22.5\n\n10\n\n0.03223 \u00b1 0.00728\n1.293 \u00b1 0.005\n\nSigma\n\n102\n\n22\n5\n\n21.5\n\n10\n\n21\n\n0\n\n20.5\n\n1\n\n-85.66105h40m\n\n05h35m\n\n05h30m -81.605\nRA (hours)\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nDec (deg)\n\n25\n\n23.5\n\n\u03c7 2 / ndf\n\n35\n\n40\n\u03c3\n\n15\n\n57.15 / 50\n\n10\n\nMean\n\n0.02805 \u00b1 0.00591\n1.061 \u00b1 0.004\n\nSigma\n10\n\n1940 \u00b1 13.3\n\nConstant\n\n3\n\n22.5\n\n30\n\nSignificance Distribution - Model\n\nSignificance Map - Model\n\n23\n\n20\n\n102\n\n22\n5\n\n21.5\n\n10\n\n21\n\n0\n\n20.5\n\n1\n\n-85.66105h40m\n\n05h35m\n\n05h30m -81.605\nRA (hours)\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\u03c3\n\n6000\n\nShower Goodness\n\n#events\n\nFig. 32.

This significant improvement over earlier works leads to an improved angular and energy resolution,\nand background rejection, resulting in an increase of the sensitivity of the\nH.E.S.S. telescope system by a factor close to 2. The model analysis is less\nsensitive than reconstruction techniques based on Hillas parameters to instrumental or environmental effects (missing pixels, night sky background\nvariation across the field of view, . . . ), thus allowing an optimal use of the\nfull dynamical range of the instruments. This novel reconstruction technique\nshould also benefit to upcoming projects such as CTA and AGIS.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank Prof. W. Hofmann, spokesman of the H.E.S.S.
