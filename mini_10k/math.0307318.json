Introduction\nA convex polytope is a convex bounded polyhedron in Rn . We say that a\npolytope is simple if there are exactly n edges emanating from each of its vertices.\nIn addition, if the lines along the edges of a simple polytope are generated by a\nZ-basis of the lattice Zn , the polytope is called regular.\nLet M be a toric manifold and let T be the torus acting on M . The image\nof M under the moment map of the torus action is a regular polytope \u2206 which\nlies on t\u2217 (the dual of the Lie algebra t of T). Each integral lattice point in t\u2217\ncorresponds to a character of a representation of T. Counting lattice points in \u2206\nis closely related to the quantization commutes with reduction principle. For the\nDolbeault quantization, this principle states that each character \u03b1 of T occurs in\nthe quantization of M with multiplicity 1 or 0 depending on whether the lattice\npoint representing \u03b1 is in \u2206 or not. (c.f. [5], [6].)\nWe use the Atiyah-Bott Berline-Vergne localization formula in equivariant cohomology and a notion of polarization to give a weighted version of the quantization\ncommutes with reduction principle for a toric manifold. This is expressed as a way\nof counting lattice points in \u2206 with weights. From a combinatorial point of view,\nwe can count lattice points in \u2206 using a polytope decomposition due to Lawrence\n[10] and Varchenko [14]. (See Figure 1 in Subsection \u00a7\u00a72.1.) We give a weighted\ndecomposition formula for any simple polytope that generalizes the Lawrence and\nVarchenko polytope decomposition. This formula also extends a previous weighted\nversion obtained by Karshon, Sternberg and Weitsman.

Definitions and Facts\nFor the reader's convenience, we collect in this section some definitions, facts\nand remarks to be used later on in this paper.\n2.1. Ordinary polar decomposition. A convex polytope \u2206 in Rn is a\nconvex bounded polyhedron given by an intersection of half-spaces \u2206 = \u2229Hi ,\nwhere\nHi = {x \u2208 Rn | hx, ui i \u2265 \u03bbi , \u03bbi \u2208 R}\n\nfor i = 1, * * * , N > n,\n\nwith ui \u2208 (Rn )\u2217 \u2243 Rn and where N denotes the number of (n \u2212 1)-dimensional\nfaces (the facets) of \u2206. The vector ui can be thought of as the inward normal to\nthe i-th facet of \u2206 contained in the hyperplane hx, ui i = \u03bbi . We assume that \u2206\nis obtained with the smallest possible N . We also assume that our polytopes are\nalways compact and convex.\nA polytope is simple if there are exactly n edges emanating from each vertex\nand is regular1 if, in addition, the edges emanating from each vertex lie along lines\nwhich are generated by an integral basis of Zn . If the vertices of a polytope are in\nthe lattice Zn , we call it integral.\nLet \u2206 be a simple polytope in Rn . Then, we have n edges emanating from\neach of its vertices. Let v be a vertex. We choose \u03b11,v , . . . , \u03b1n,v in the direction\nof the edges pointing from v to other vertices of \u2206. Up to a positive scalar and\npermutation, these edge vectors are uniquely determined. When \u2206 is regular and\nintegral, we can choose \u03b11,v , . . . , \u03b1n,v to have integer entries. In this case, we shall\nimpose the additional normalization condition that the edge vectors be primitive\nelements of the lattice Zn ; namely, none of them can be expressed as a multiple\nof a lattice element by an integer greater than one. This fixes our choice of edge\nvectors for such polytopes.\nThe tangent cone Cv at v is\nCv = {v + r(x \u2212 v) | r \u2265 0, x \u2208 \u2206} = v +\n\nn\nX\n\nR\u22650 \u03b1j,v .\n\nj=1\n\nNotice that we can always find a vector \u03be such that h\u03b1j,v , \u03bei 6= 0 for all v and\nj. To see this, we can think of an edge vector as the normal vector of a hyperplane\nin Rn passing through the origin. Since there are a finite number of edge vectors,\nwe have a finite number of such hyperplanes. They split Rn into several connected\ncomponents. We pick \u03be such that it is not perpendicular to the boundary of these\ncomponents.\nDefinition 1. A polarizing vector \u03be for a simple polytope \u2206 \u2282 Rn is a vector\nin Rn such that h\u03b1j,v , \u03bei =\n6 0 for all vertices v and all edge vectors \u03b11,v , . . . , \u03b1n,v .\n1our regular polytopes are also known as smooth or Delzant polytopes [4], [6].\n\n\fA WEIGHTED VERSION OF QUANTIZATION COMMUTES WITH REDUCTION\n\n3\n\nAt each vertex v, we define the polarized vectors \u03b1\u266fj,v by\n\u001a\n\u03b1j,v if h\u03b1j,v , \u03bei < 0\n(unflipped)\n\u266f\n.\n(1)\n\u03b1j,v =\n\u2212\u03b1j,v if h\u03b1j,v , \u03bei > 0\n(flipped)\n\nThis process is called polarization. Then, the polarized tangent cone C\u266fv at v is\nC\u266fv = v +\n\nn\nX\n\nR\u22650 \u03b1\u266fj,v .\n\nj=1\n\nWe have the following (adapted) decomposition of a simple polytope due to\nLawrence [10] and Varchenko [14].\nProposition 1. Let \u2206 be a simple polytope in Rn . For any choice of polarizing\nvector, we have\nX\n(2)\n1\u2206 =\n(\u22121)#v 1C\u266fv ,\nv\n\nwhere the sum is over all vertices v of the polytope and the symbols 1\u2206 and 1C\u266fv\ndenote the ordinary characteristic functions over \u2206 and over the polarized tangent\ncones C\u266fv (possibly with some facets removed). In this formula, #v denotes the\nnumber of edge vectors at v flipped by the polarization process (1).\nLawrence [10] and Varchenko [14] formulas actually hold for any simple convex\npolyhedron of full dimension in Rn . In the case of lattice polytopes, \u2206 \u2229 Zn , we\navoid removing certain facets from the cones C\u266fv , by shifting some of the cones. We\nillustrate this decomposition in Figure 1.\nb\nb b\nb b b\nb b b b\nB A\n\nb\nb\nb\nb\nb\n\nb\n\u2212\nb b\nb b b\nb b b b\n\nb b b b\nb b b\nb b\nb\n\nb\nb\nb\nb\nb\n\nb\nb\nb\nb1\nb\n\nb\nb\nb\nb\nb\n\nb\nb\nb\nb\nb\n\nA\n\nb\nb\nb\nb1\nb\nb\n\nb\nb\nb\nb\nb\nb\n\nb\nb\nb\nb\nb\n\nb\nb\nb\nb\nb b\nb\n=\nb1 b b\nb\nb b b b\nb\nb b b b b b\n\nCb\n\n1\n\nC\n\nb\n+\nb b\nb b b\nb b b b\n\nB\n\nFigure 1. Ordinary polar decomposition of a lattice triangle\n2.2. Some classical formal power series. We will pay attention to three\nformal power series.\nThe Todd function Td(x) is defined as\nx\n1\n1\n1 4\nTd(x) =\n= 1 + x + x2 \u2212\nx + *** .\n\u2212x\n1\u2212e\n2\n12\n720\nSince\nx\n= e\u2212x Td(x),\nTd(\u2212x) = x\ne \u22121\n\n\f4\n\nJOS\u00c9 AGAPITO\n\nwe can formally average Td(x) and Td(\u2212x) to get\n1\n(Td(x) + Td(\u2212x))\n2\n\n1\n1 + e\u2212x\nTd(x)(1 + e\u2212x ) = (x/2)\n2\n1 \u2212 e\u2212x\nx/2\nex/2 + e\u2212x/2\n,\n=\n(x/2) x/2\ntanh(x/2)\ne\n\u2212 e\u2212x/2\n\n=\n=\n\nwhich is known as the L\u0302(x) function. Both Td(x) and L\u0302(x) are particular instances\nof the more general formal power series\nQ(y, x) =\n\nx(1 + y)\nx(1 + ye\u2212x(1+y) )\n\u2212\nyx\n=\n.\n1 \u2212 e\u2212x(1+y)\n1 \u2212 e\u2212x(1+y)\n\nThis is the Hirzebruch function. When y = 0 we get Td(x) and if y = 1 and x is\nreplaced by x/2, we get L\u0302(x). The Hirzebruch function can also be written as\nQ(y, x) =\n\ny\n1\nTd(x(1 + y)) +\nTd(\u2212x(1 + y)).\n1+y\n1+y\n\nWe replace x by x/(1 + y) above and denote the resulting formula by Qy (x). We\nhave a weighted average of Td(x) and Td(\u2212x). For any y 6= \u22121 it follows that\nQy (x) =\n\n1\nTd(x)(1 + ye\u2212x ).\n1+y\n\nThese classical formal power series define well known topological invariants;\nnamely, characteristic classes associated to vector bundles over a manifold. Let M\nbe a compact manifold and let E \u2192 M be a complex vector bundle over M . By\nthe Splitting principle in topology (c.f. [2]), we can always assume that E splits\ninto a direct sum of complex line bundles,\nE = L1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Lr .\nThen the Todd class Td(E) of E is given by\n(3)\n\nTd(E) =\n\nr\nY\n\nc1 (Lk )\n,\n1\n\u2212\ne\u2212c1 (Lk )\nk=1\n\nwhere c1 (L1 ), . . . , c1 (Lr ) are the first Chern classes of the line bundles L1 , . . . , Lr .\nSimilarly, the L\u0302-class of E and more generally the Hirzebruch Qy -class of E are\nrespectively defined by\n\n(4)\n\nr\nY\n1\n(1 + e\u2212c1 (Lk ) ) and\nL\u0302(E) = Td(E)\n2\nk=1\nr\nY\n\nQy (E) = Td(E)\n\nk=1\n\n1\n(1 + ye\u2212c1 (Lk ) ).\n1+y\n\nWe say that a bundle E \u2192 M stably splits if E \u2295 Cr \u2243 \u2295Lj , where Cr denotes\na trivial bundle over M and \u2295Lj is a direct sum of complex line bundles Lj \u2192 M .\nSince E \u2243 \u2295Lk (by the Splitting principle) and Td(Cr ) = 1, it follows from (3)\nthat Td(E \u2295 Cr ) = Td(E). The same is true for L(E) and Qy (E). Now, let\nT be a torus and let E be a T-equivariant vector bundle over M . We have the\n\n\fA WEIGHTED VERSION OF QUANTIZATION COMMUTES WITH REDUCTION\n\n5\n\ncorresponding T-equivariant versions of (3) and (4),\nTdT (E) =\n(5)\n\nr\nY\n\nk=1\n\ncT\n1 (Lk )\nT\n1 \u2212 e\u2212c1 (Lk )\n\nT\nQT\ny (E) = Td (E)\n\nr\nY\n\nk=1\n\nand\n\nT\n1\n(1 + ye\u2212c1 (Lk ) ).\n1+y\n\n2.3. Toric manifolds and quantization commutes with reduction. Let\nT = (S 1 )n be a torus whose Lie algebra is denoted by t. A toric manifold is a space\n(M, \u03c9, \u03bc), where (M, \u03c9) is a compact and connected symplectic 2n-dimensional\nmanifold on which T acts effectively and in a Hamiltonian fashion with moment\nmap \u03bc. This means that the action of T on M has trivial kernel, that the torus\naction leaves invariant the symplectic form \u03c9 and that M is provided with a Tequivariant map \u03bc : M \u2192 t\u2217 such that \u0131X\u03b7 \u03c9 = dh\u03bc, \u03b7i for any \u03b7 \u2208 t. The function\nh\u03bc, \u03b7i is the component of \u03bc in the direction of \u03b7 and X\u03b7 is the vector field on M\ngenerated by \u03b7. Examples of toric manifolds are the complex projective spaces CPn\nand blow ups, CPn #CPn # . . . #CPn .\nUnder the moment map, toric manifolds (smooth toric varieties) correspond to\nregular polytopes and toric orbifolds (singular toric varieties) correspond to simple\npolytopes, modulo equivariant symplectomorphisms and translations respectively\n(c.f. [4], [5], [12].) The image of a toric manifold under the moment map is called\nmoment polytope and its vertices correspond to the fixed point set of the torus\naction over the manifold. In general, we say that a symplectic manifold (M, \u03c9) is\nprequantizable if there is a Hermitian complex line bundle L \u2192 M such that\nc1 (L) = [\u03c9]. Such a line bundle is a prequantization of (M, \u03c9). In the case\nof a toric manifold, M is prequantizable if and only if the vertices of its moment\npolytope (possibly shifted) are integral lattice points. (c.f. [5], [6].)\nLet (M, \u03c9, \u03bc) be a toric manifold and let L \u2192 M be a prequantization of M .\nThe theory of geometric quantization associates a virtual representation Q(M ) of T\nto M together with L. The virtual vector space Q(M ) is called the quantization\nof the action of T on (M, L). For instance, for the Dolbeault quantization we have\nQ(M ) = kernel DL \u2295 \u2212cokernel DL , where DL is the Dolbeault operator defined on\nthe complex \u03a9\u2217 (M ) of differential forms on M twisted by L. (c.f. [5], [6].) In this\ncase, the dimension of Q(M ) can be computed by the Atiyah-Singer index theorem,\n(6)\n\ndim Q(M ) := ind(DL ) =\n\nZ\n\nec1 (L) Td(M ),\n\nM\n\nwhere Td(M ) is the Todd class of the tangent bundle of M and c1 (L) is the first\nChern class of the prequantization line bundle L \u2192 M .\nThe integer dim Q(M ) in (6) is equal to the number of integral lattice points\nin \u2206 = \u03bc(M ) [3]. This is a manifestation of the quantization commutes with\nreduction principle in symplectic geometry. To be more precise, if \u03b1 is a weight\nof the torus representation on Q(M ), we define Q(M )\u03b1 as the subspace of Q(M )\non which T acts via the character given by \u03b1. The quantization commutes with\nreduction principle is stated as\n(7)\n\ndim Q(M )\u03b1 = dim Q(M\u03b1 ),\n\n\f6\n\nJOS\u00c9 AGAPITO\n\nwhere M\u03b1 is the reduced space of M at \u03b1. The number dim Q(M )\u03b1 is the multiplicity of the character given by \u03b1 in Q(M ) [6]. For the Dolbeault quantization,\nthis multiplicity is 1 or 0 depending on whether \u03b1 is in \u2206 or not. Since M is a toric\nmanifold, the reduced space M\u03b1 is a point when \u03b1 is in \u2206 and is empty otherwise.\nTherefore, we have\nX\ndim Q(M ) = # of integer lattice points in \u2206 =\ndim Q(M\u03b1 ).\n\u03b1\u2208\u2206\u2229Zn\n\nCounting multiplicities boils down to counting integral lattice points in \u2206. We\ncan use Proposition 1 to do this count in terms of an alternating sum over shifted\npolarized cones.\nNow, assume that L is a T-equivariant prequantization line bundle for (M, \u03c9, \u03bc).\nThis means that the T-action on M lifts to a T-action on L by bundle automorphisms and also that L is provided with a connection \u2207 such that its equivariant\n2\ncurvature is \u03c9 \u2212 i\u03bc. This implies that cT\n1 (L) = [\u03c9 \u2212 i\u03bc]. On the other hand, by a\nT-equivariant version of (6) (see Bismut [1]), the character \u03c7 around 0 \u2208 t of this\nrepresentation of T on Q(M ) is\nZ\nT\nec1 (L) TdT (M ),\n(8)\n\u03c7 \u25e6 exp =\nM\n\nwhere exp denotes the exponential map from t to T. Using the Atiyah-Bott BerlineVergne localization formula in equivariant cohomology (c.f. [5]), the right hand side\nof (8) can be expressed as a finite sum over the fixed points F of the torus action\non M ,\nZ\nn\nX\nY\nT\n1\n.\nec1 (L) TdT (M ) =\n(9)\ne\u2212ih\u03bc(F ),ui\n\u2212ih\u03b1\nj,F ,ui\n1\u2212e\nM\nj=1\nF\n\nCombining (9) with the notion of polarization gives us a way of counting the lattice\npoints of the moment polytope of a toric manifold in terms of the lattice points of\ncones based on the vertices of the polytope. This insight provided by the localization\nformula in the context of quantization commutes with reduction for toric manifolds\ninspires us to give a weighted polar decomposition for any simple polytope, not\nnecessarily integral. The proof of this result is completely independent from the\nuse of the localization formula and is shown in Section \u00a74.\n3. Weighted quantization commutes with reduction\n\nDefinition 2.

Assume that the vertices of \u2206 are in Zn , then M is prequantizable. Let L \u2192 M\nbe a prequantization complex line bundle over M and assume furthermore that\nL is T-equivariant. The equivariant Chern class cT\n1 (L) is equal to [\u03c9 \u2212 i\u03bc]. The\n2the first T-equivariant Chern class cT (L) is of the form [\u03c9 + \u03bc] up to a constant.

In this case, we can write (28) as in [8]\nand [9],\nX\n1w\n.\n(\u22121)#v 1w\n\u2206 =\nC\u266f\nv\n\nv\n\nWe illustrate Proposition 2 for a triangle in Figure 2.\n\nt\nu\n\n= 1\u2212q\n\nt\nu\nb u\nt\nb b t\nu\nb b b u\nt\n\nd = q(1 \u2212 q)\nl\n\nb= 1\n\nld = (1 \u2212 q)2\n\nA\n\nB A\n\nb b b b\nb b b b\nb\nb b b b\nb b\nb b b b\n\u2212\n+\nb b b\nb b b b\nb b b b\nb b b b\nu u\nt\nt t\nu u\nt t\nu\nt u\nt u\nt t\nu\nd u\nl\nt\nu\n\nt\nu\n\nC\n\nt\nu\n\nt\nu\n\nb\nb\nb\nb\nb\nt\nu\n\nt\nu\n\nu\nt\nt\nu\nt\nu\nt\nu\nrs\n\nu\nt\nt\nu\nt\nu\nt\nu\nb u\nt\nt\nu\n=\nb b t\nu\nt\nu\nb b b u\nt\nt\nu\nu u\nt\nt u\nt u\nt rs rs\n\nt\nu\n\nCrs\n\nt\nu\nb\nb\nb\nb\n\nt= q\nu\n\nld\nt\nu\nt\nu\nt\nu\nt\nu\nu\nt\n\nrs = q 2\n\nB\n\nFigure 2. Weighted polar decomposition of a lattice triangle\nProof. The proof has two steps. First, for each x \u2208 Rn we choose a polarizing\nvector \u03bex such that (28) holds. For this, we show that x appears in at most one\npolarized tangent cone in the corresponding polar decomposition of \u2206 given by \u03bex .\nSecond, we show that the right hand side of (28) is independent of the choice of\npolarization.\nNotice that for any polarization there is always a unique cone with no edges\nflipped at all. More explicitly, if x is in the exterior of \u2206, we can take the closest\nvertex of \u2206 to x (if there are more than one such a vertex, pick any one of them).\nSay we take v1 . Then, we set C\u266fv1 = Cv1 . Clearly x is not in C\u266fv1 . We polarize\naccording to this cone. Namely, let \u03bex be a polarizing vector in Rn that makes\nC\u266fv1 = Cv1 and let E\u03bex be a codimension one plane with normal vector parallel to\n\u03bex . Moving this plane in a parallel way through the polytope, we flip the edges\nof the tangent cones whose vertices lie below E\u03bex (according to \u03bex ) until we get\nto the farthest vertex v2 away from v1 in the direction of \u03bex . There is only one\nsuch a vertex since \u03bex is a polarizing vector. The corresponding polarized tangent\n\n\f12\n\nJOS\u00c9 AGAPITO\n\ncone C\u266fv2 has all their edges flipped with respect to Cv2 and it does not contain x.\nIn general, a polarizing vector flips an edge if this edge is shared with a previous\npolarized tangent cone and leaves that edge unflipped otherwise. Then, for any\nvertex other than v1 and v2 , the polarized tangent cones have at least one edge\nflipped and they all appear pointing away from x. We conclude that x appears in\nno polarized tangent cone.\nIf x is in \u2206, we can pick any vertex v in the face F whose relative interior\ncontains x. Then, we set the polarized tangent cone C\u266fv equal to Cv and choose a\npolarizing vector \u03bex that makes C\u266fv = Cv . We now repeat the process explained\nabove. Again, all other polarized tangent cones will point away from x, with the\ncone at the farthest vertex away from v having all their edges flipped.\nFrom here on, we follow [8] closely with some modifications. Let\nE1 , * * * , EN\ndenote all the different codimension one subspaces of Rn \u2217 that are equal to\nn\u2217\n\u03b1\u22a5\n| h\u03b7, \u03b1j,v i = 0}\nj,v = {\u03b7 \u2208 R\n\nfor some j and v. If no two edges of \u2206 are parallel, then the number N of such\nhyperplanes is equal to the number of edges of \u2206. A vector \u03be is a polarizing vector\nif and only if it does not belong to any Ej . The polarized tangent cones C\u266fv only\ndepend on the connected component of the complement\nRn \u2217 r(E1 \u222a * * * \u222a EN )\nin which \u03be lies. Any two polarizing vectors can be connected by a path \u03bet in Rn \u2217\nwhich crosses the walls Ej one at a time.\nThe second part of the proof consists of showing that the right hand side of\nformula (28) does not change when the polarizing vector \u03bet crosses a single wall,\nEk .\nAs \u03bet crosses the wall Ek , the sign of the pairing h\u03bet , \u03b1j,v i changes exactly if\n\u2032\nEk = \u03b1\u22a5\nj,v . For each vertex v, denote by Sv (x) and Sv (x) its contributions to the\nright hand side of formula (28) before and after \u03bet crosses the wall. The vertices\nfor which these contributions differ are exactly those vertices that lie on edges e of\n\u2206 which are perpendicular to Ek . They come in pairs because each edge has two\nendpoints.\nLet us concentrate on one such an edge, e, with endpoints, say, u and v. Let \u03b1e\ndenote an edge vector at v that points from v to u along e. Suppose that the pairing\nh\u03bet , \u03b1e i flips its sign from negative to positive as \u03bet crosses the wall; (otherwise we\nswitch the roles of v and u). The polarized tangent cones to \u2206 at v, before and\nafter \u03bet crosses the wall, are\nX\nX\nC\u266fv = v +\nR\u22650 \u03b1\u266fj,v + R\u22650 \u03b1e and (C\u266fv )\u2032 = v +\nR\u22650 \u03b1\u266fj,v \u2212 R\u22650 \u03b1e ,\nj\u2208Ie\n\nj\u2208Ie\n\nwhere Ie \u2282 {1, * * * , N } encodes the facets that contain e. (The \u03b1\u266fj,v are the same\nfor the different \u03bet 's because the pairings h\u03bet , \u03b1\u266fj,v i do not flip sign when \u03bet crosses\nthe wall for j \u2208 Ie .) Notice that the cones C\u266fv and (C\u266fv )\u2032 have a common facet\nand their union only depends on the edge e and not on the endpoint v. (This\nuses the assumption that the polytope \u2206 is simple and follows from the fact that\n\u03b1j,u \u2208 R\u22650 \u03b1j,v + R\u03b1e .)\n\n\fA WEIGHTED VERSION OF QUANTIZATION COMMUTES WITH REDUCTION\n\n13\n\nTo determine the contributions of v to the right hand side of (28) before and\nafter \u03bet crosses the wall, we have two cases to analyze. In the first case, the smallest\ndimensional face F containing x also contains the edge e. Then, the contributions\nare\n\u0013r1 (x) \u0012\n\u0013r2 (x)\n\u0012\ny\n1\nand Sv\u2032 (x) = \u2212\u03b5 * 0,\nSv (x) = \u03b5\n1+y\n1+y\nwhere \u03b5 \u2208 {\u22121, 1}. Their difference is\n\u0012\n\u0013r1 (x) \u0012\n\u0013r2 (x)\n1\ny\nSv (x) \u2212 Sv\u2032 (x) = \u03b5\n.\n1+y\n1+y\nThe contributions of the other endpoint, u, are\n\u0013r1 (x) \u0012\n\u0013r2 (x)\n\u0012\ny\n1\n\u2032\n,\nSu (x) = \u2212\u03b5 * 0 and Su (x) = \u03b5\n1+y\n1+y\nand their difference is\nSu (x) \u2212 Su\u2032 (x) = \u2212\u03b5\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1+y\n\n\u0013r1 (x) \u0012\n\ny\n1+y\n\n\u0013r2 (x)\n\n.\n\nNotice that the numbers r1 (x) and r2 (x) remain the same for both endpoints because F contains the edge e. Hence, the differences Sv (x)\u2212Sv\u2032 (x) and Su (x)\u2212Su\u2032 (x),\nfor the two endpoints u and v of e, sum to zero.\nIn the second case, the edge e is not contained in F . Then, the contributions\nare\n\u0012\n\u0013r1 (x) \u0012\n\u0013r2 (x)\n1\ny\nSv (x) = \u03b5\nand\n1+y\n1+y\n\u0013r1 (x)\u22121 \u0012\n\u0013r2 (x)+1\n\u0012\ny\n1\n\u2032\nSv (x) = \u2212\u03b5\n,\n1+y\n1+y\nand their difference is\nSv (x) \u2212 Sv\u2032 (x) = \u03b5\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1+y\n\n\u0013r1 (x)\u22121 \u0012\n\ny\n1+y\n\n\u0013r2 (x)\n\n.\n\nOn the other hand, after crossing the wall, the smallest dimensional face F \u2032 in C\u266fu\ncontaining x has codimension one less than the codimension of F in C\u266fv , before\ncrossing the wall. Then, a straightforward calculation shows that the contributions\nof the other endpoint, u, are\n\u0012\n\u0013r1 (x)\u22121 \u0012\n\u0013r2 (x)\n1\ny\n\u2032\nSu (x) = \u2212\u03b5 * 0 and Su (x) = \u03b5\n,\n1+y\n1+y\nand their difference is\nSu (x) \u2212\n\nSu\u2032 (x)\n\n= \u2212\u03b5\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1+y\n\n\u0013r1 (x)\u22121 \u0012\n\ny\n1+y\n\n\u0013r2 (x)\n\n.\n\nHence, the differences Sv (x) \u2212 Sv\u2032 (x) and Su (x) \u2212 Su\u2032 (x), for the two endpoints u\nand v of e, sum to zero again.\n\u0003\n\n\f14\n\nJOS\u00c9 AGAPITO\n\nReferences\n[1] J.
