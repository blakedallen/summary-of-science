This renders Luttinger's theorem inapplicable in the\nunderdoped regime.\n\nPACS: 71.10.-w, 79.60.Bm, 71.18.+y, 74.72.-h\n\nTypeset using REVTEX\n1\n\n\fAfter the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in layered Cu based perovskites it was found that those materials exhibit quite unusual properties in the normal\nstate. For example, in underdoped materials, i.e., for hole concentrations less than the one\nleading to the highest superconducting transition temperature, the temperature dependent\nresistivity is found to be \u03c1(T ) \u223c T in the normal state. Also the nuclear relaxation rate,\ne.g., of YBa2 Cu3 O7 has an unusual temperature independent contribution.\nAiming for an explanation of these strong deviations from a normal metal behavior Varma\net al.1 developed the Marginal Fermi Liquid (MFL) theory. This theory assumes that the\nfrequency \u03c9 and temperature T dependent self-energy \u03a3(\u03c9, T ) of the electrons behaves for\n\u03c9 > T like Re\u03a3(\u03c9, T ) \u223c \u03c9ln|\u03c9| and Im\u03a3(\u03c9, T ) \u223c |\u03c9| in contrast to ordinary Fermi liquid\ntheory where Re\u03a3(\u03c9, T ) \u223c \u03c9 and Im\u03a3(\u03c9, T ) \u223c \u03c9 2 holds. Note that at zero temperature the\nMFL form of the self-energy implies a diverging effective mass at the Fermi energy. With\nthese assumptions most of the observed strong deviations from normal metal behavior could\nbe explained surprisingly well. However, the microscopic origin of MFL behavior of the\nself-energy has remained an open problem.\nThere have been detailed studies of the two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model as a simple model for the high-Tc cuprates2 mainly by using advanced numerical techniques. We\nmention in particular the Lanczos method2 , the Quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC)3\u20135 method\nor calculations based on the Dynamical Cluster Approximation (DCA)6 .\nA perturbation analysis of the half-filled case at T = 0 has shown that in the weak\nCoulomb interaction limit a MFL type of self-energy is obtained7 . It is due to the van\nHove singularities which one is dealing with in this particular case. But we know that\nelectron correlations are strong in the superconducting cuprates and that at T = 0 the\nsystem is an antiferromagnet2,5,8 . It is also known that by hole doping the antiferromagnetic\ncorrelations are rapidly suppressed2,5,6,9 . Nevertheless MFL behavior continues to exist in\nthe underdoped regime and the question is whether or not it can be explained within the\n2D Hubbard model with fairly strong interactions.\nThe aim of this letter is to demonstrate that MFL behavior can indeed be derived from\na doped 2D Hubbard model on a square lattice at T = 0 and large on-site interaction. This\n2\n\n\fhas become possible with the help of a recently developed self-consistent projection operator\nmethod (SCPM)10 . It allows for high resolution calculations of the self-energy as regards\nits momentum and energy and avoids certain problems previous numerical calculations have\nhad to face.\nThe SCPM is an extension to the nonlocal case of a projection operator coherent potential approximation11 . The latter was shown to be equivalent to the many-body CPA, the\ndynamical CPA as well as the dynamical mean-field theory12 . In the following we outline\nbriefly the main equations which are used before we present the numerical results demonstrating MFL behavior. More detailed derivations of the equations are found in the original\nliterature10\u201312 .\nStarting point is the retarded Green function\nGk (z) =\n\n1\n.\nz \u2212 \u01ebk \u2212 \u039bk (z)\n\n(1)\n\nHere z = \u03c9 + i\u03b4 where \u03b4 is a positive infinitesimal number, \u01ebk is the Hartree-Fock oneelectron dispersion measured from the Fermi energy and \u039bk (z) is the self-energy calculated\nfrom the nonlocal memory matrix Mij according to\n\u039bk (z) = U 2\n\nX\n\nMj0 (z) exp(ik * Rj ) .\n\n(2)\n\nj\n\nWhile U denotes the Hubbard on-site interaction, Rj is the position vector of site j.

The latter can be expressed in terms of a \"screened memory matrix\" M\u0302\n\n(c)\n\n(z)\n\nand a matrix L(c) (z) which describes on-site excitations.

The matrix \u03c1\u0303ij (\u01eb) describes the\n\ndensity of states of a system with an empty site i (or sites i and j) embedded in a\n\nmedium with a coherent potential \u03a3\u0303(z).\nconsistently from \u03a3\u0303(z) = N \u22121\n\nThis coherent potential is determined self-\n\nk \u039bk (z) where N is the number of sites.\n\nP\n\nMoreover,\n\n\u03c7(\u01eb, \u01eb\u2032 , \u01eb\u2032\u2032 ) = f (\u2212\u01eb)f (\u2212\u01eb\u2032 )f (\u01eb\u2032\u2032 )+f (\u01eb)f (\u01eb\u2032 )f (\u2212\u01eb\u2032\u2032 ). We want to emphasize that in Eqs. (2)-(4)\nall memory matrices with site i separated sufficiently far from site j are taken into account\nuntil convergency is obtained.\nIt follows from Eqs. (5) and (6) that the self-energy reduces in the limit of small U\nto second order perturbation theory while in the limit of large U the exact result of the\natomic limit is reproduced10 . Although the above computational scheme looks at first sight\nsomewhat difficult to handle, this is not really the case. In fact, it allows us to calculate the\nself-energy directly without having to do a numerical analytic continuation or an interpolation in k space. Therefore we obtain for it a high resolution in energy and momentum. In\nthe numerical calculations we have done, we assumed a paramagnetic ground state since the\nantiferromagnetism is suppressed away from half-filling. Whenever possible we have made\ncomparisons with Quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) results and the agreement was always very\nsatisfactory.\nIn Fig. 1 the momentum dependent excitation spectrum is shown in the underdoped\ncase for U = 8 (in units of the nearest-neighbor transfer integral) and T = 0. One notices\nan empty upper Hubbard band centered around the M point and a flat quasiparticle band\ncrossing the Fermi energy \u01ebF . There is also incoherent spectral density near the \u0393 point resulting from the lower Hubbard band. Also shown are QMC results for finite temperatures5 .\nResults for the Fermi surface are shown in Fig. 2. For n = 0.95 (underdoped case) a hole4\n\n\flike Fermi surface is obtained. Due to a collapse of the lower Hubbard band the portion of\nthe flat band around the X points sinks below the Fermi level. In the overdoped regime\nthe Fermi surface is electron-like. It is seen that Luttinger's theorem13 does not apply here.\nThese results agree with the ones obtained from the DCA6 .\nBy taking numerical derivatives of \u039bk (z) we have determined the momentum dependent\neffective mass mk = 1 \u2212 \u2202Re\u039bk (0+ )/\u2202\u03c9 in the underdoped regime (see Fig. 3). To our\nknowledge this is something which could not be done before. For doping less than 2 % mk\nchanges strongly between the minimum value at the M point and the maximum value at\nthe X point, while for dopings larger than 2 % the momentum dependence of mk is weak\nwith a maximum at \u0393 and not at X as in the underdoped regime. Most important is the\nstrong dependence of mk near the X point on the chosen step size \u03b4\u03c9 when the derivative\nis taken. This is a clear signature of MFL behavior. Because of the numerical derivative\ntaken of Re\u039bk at \u03c9 = 0 we obtained a finite value of mk \u223c ln\u03b4\u03c9 instead of a divergency. In\nfact, in the limit of vanishing hole doping (half-filled case) we find a typical MFL behavior\nof \u039bk (z) for U = 8 and k = (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) like in the weak interaction limit. This is shown in\nFig. 4 where the two cases are compared. Because of these features we conclude that for\nU = 8 and doping less than 2 % MFL theory applies, while for doping concentrations of\nmore than 2 % normal Fermi liquid theory is valid.\nThe different nature of the states for doping concentrations \u03b4h < 0.02 and \u03b4h > 0.02 is\nclearly seen in the density of states (DOS) presented in Fig. 5 for U = 8. Consider first the\ncase \u03b4h < 0.02. With increasing doping concentration spectral density is shifted from the\nlower to the upper Hubbard band, or more generally to higher energies. As a consequence\nthe peak in the DOS remains at \u01ebF , i.e., it does not shift for small doping concentrations.\nTherefore the self-energy has to good approximations the same frequency dependence as\nfor half-filling. This is the origin of MFL behavior. When \u03b4h > 0.02 the lower Hubbard\nband has essentially collapsed and the peak in the DOS moves away from \u01ebF . In that case\nconventional Fermi liquid behavior sets in. This occurs in a rather discontinuous way. This\nis seen from the phase diagram shown in Fig. 6. The MFL regime with a still existing lower\nHubbard band is separated by a region in which two self-consistent solutions are found from\n5\n\n\fthe one with a collapsed lower Hubbard band. One may consider that transition as one from\nquasi-localized electrons to fully itinerant ones. Note that when \u03b4h < 0.01 the MFL regime\nis divided into two regimes. The two solutions found are only slightly different in the amount\nof the reduction of the lower Hubbard band. For fixed value of \u03b4h the discontinuous behavior\nof the self-energy as function of U implies that Luttinger's theorem13 is not applicable. For\nU < 6.5 the MFL behavior at half-filling changes smoothly to a Fermi liquid state.\nIn summary, by using the SCPM we could calculate the zero-temperature self-energy\n\u039bk (z) for the 2D Hubbard model with high resolution with respect to \u03c9 and k. We find a\nMFL like behavior for quite a large range of hole doping concentration and U. We obtain\nthere a strong momentum dependence of the effective mass. In cases where a comparison\nwith finite temperature results3\u20136 can be made the agreement is good. When U > 6.5 a\ndiscontinuous change takes place with increasing hole concentration from more localized\nelectrons with a lower Hubbard band to fully itinerant ones. In the latter case the lower\nHubbard band is absent. It is precisely the transfer of spectral density from the lower\nHubbard band to higher energies which results in MFL behavior at low hole concentrations.\nAbove the upper discontinuity lines Luttinger's theorem is not applicable. Very close to\nhalf-filling long-ranged antiferromagnetic correlations are expected to modify the present\nresults. Those correlations have been neglected here.\n\n6\n\n\fREFERENCES\n1\n\nC.M.
