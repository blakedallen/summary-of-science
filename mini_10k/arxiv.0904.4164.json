Michor on the occasion of his 60th birthday\nAbstract. We prove that the roots of a definable C \u221e curve of monic hyperbolic polynomials admit a definable C \u221e parameterization, where 'definable'\nrefers to any fixed o-minimal structure on (R, +, *). Moreover, we provide sufficient conditions, in terms of the differentiability of the coefficients and the\norder of contact of the roots, for the existence of C p (for p \u2208 N) arrangements\nof the roots in both the definable and the non-definable case. These conditions are sharp in the definable and under an additional assumption also in\nthe non-definable case. In particular, we obtain a simple proof of Bronshtein's\ntheorem in the definable setting. We prove that the roots of definable C \u221e\ncurves of complex polynomials can be desingularized by means of local power\nsubstitutions t 7\u2192 \u00b1tN . For a definable continuous curve of complex polynomials we show that any continuous choice of roots is actually locally absolutely\ncontinuous.\n\n1. Introduction\nPn\nA monic polynomial P (x) = xn + j=1 (\u22121)aj xn\u2212j is called hyperbolic if all its\nroots are real. The study of the regularity of its roots, when P depends smoothly\non a real parameter, is a classical topic with important applications in PDE and\nperturbation theory. Rellich [11] showed that a real analytic curve of hyperbolic\npolynomials P admits real analytic roots. However, the roots of a C \u221e curve P do\nin general not allow C \u221e (more precisely, C 1,\u03b1 for any \u03b1 > 0) parameterizations. All\ncounter-examples (e.g. in [6], [1], [2]) are oscillating, meaning that some derivative\nswitches sign infinitely often near some point, where the multiplicity of the roots\nchanges. By [1], P allows C \u221e roots, if no two roots meet of infinite order.\nWe show in this note that definability of the coefficients guarantees C \u221e solvability of C \u221e curves of hyperbolic polynomials. By 'definable' we mean definable in\nsome fixed, but arbitrary, o-minimal structure M on (R, +, *). Definability excludes\noscillation, however, infinitely flat functions may be definable in some M. We also\nprovide sufficient conditions, in terms of the differentiability of the coefficients and\nthe order of contact of the roots, for the existence of C p (for p \u2208 N) arrangements\nof the roots in both the definable and the non-definable case. These conditions are\nsharp in the definable and under an additional assumption (automatically satisfied\nif n \u2264 4) also in the non-definable case. In particular, we give a simple proof of\nBronshtein's theorem in the special case of definable coefficients: C n curves P admit C 1 roots (see [3], [13], and [4]). As a consequence C 2n curves P admit twice\nDate: April 27, 2009.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 26C10, 30C15, 03C64.\nKey words and phrases. hyperbolic polynomials, smooth roots, o-minimality.\nThe author was supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF), Grant J2771.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nA. RAINER\n\ndifferentiable roots (see [8] and [4]). Bronshtein's theorem is quite delicate and only\npoorly understood.\nOur results complete the perturbation theory for hyperbolic polynomials. Analogous questions for several parameters require additional assumptions and are not\ntreated in this paper: The roots of P (t1 , t2 )(x) = x2 \u2212 (t21 + t22 ), for t1 , t2 \u2208 R,\ncannot be differentiable at t1 = t2 = 0.\nIf the hyperbolicity assumption is dropped, we cannot hope for parameterizations\nof the roots satisfying a local Lipschitz condition, even if the coefficients are real\nanalytic. We prove that the roots of definable C \u221e curves of complex polynomials\ncan be desingularized by means of local power substitutions t 7\u2192 \u00b1tN . For definable\ncontinuous curves of complex polynomials, we show that any continuous choice of\nroots is actually locally absolutely continuous (not better!). This extends results in\n[10].\nI am happy to thank E. Bierstone and K. Kurdyka for the discussions which led\nto the writing of this paper.\n2. Definable functions and smoothness\n2.1. Multiplicity. For a continuous real or complex valued function f defined near\n0 in R, let the multiplicity m0 (f ) at 0 be the supremum of all integers p such that\nf (t) = tp g(t) near 0 for a continuous function g. Note that, if f is of class C n and\nm0 (f ) < n, then f (t) = tm0 (f ) g(t) near 0, where now g is C n\u2212m0 (f ) and g(0) 6= 0.\nSimilarly, one can define the multiplicity mt (f ) of a function f at any t \u2208 R.\n2.2. Lemma. Let I \u2286 R be an open interval containing 0. Let f \u2208 C 0 (I, R) and\np \u2208 N such that:\n(1) m0 (f ) \u2265 p\n(2) f |I\\{0} \u2208 C p+1 (I \\ {0})\n(3) 0 is not an accumulation point of \u2202{t \u2208 I \\ {0} : f (p+1) (t) = 0} (where\n\u2202A := A \\ A\u25e6 denotes the boundary of A) .\nThen f \u2208 C p (I).\nProof. We use induction on p. Let us assume that the assertion is proved for\nnon-negative integers < p. Note that (3) implies:\n(3') 0 is not an accumulation point of \u2202{t \u2208 I \\{0} : f (q) (t) = 0}, for any integer\n0 \u2264 q \u2264 p + 1.\nSo we may suppose that f \u2208 C p\u22121 (I), and, by (1), f (q) (0) = 0 for 0 \u2264 q \u2264 p \u2212 1.\nWe will show that f \u2208 C p (I).\nLet t > 0. By (3'), either f (p) = 0 identically, or f (p\u22121) is strictly monotonic for\nsmall t, say, t < \u03b4. In the first case f (p) extends continuously to 0. Consider the\nsecond case. Without loss we may suppose that\nf (p\u22121) (s) > f (p\u22121) (t)\n\n(2.2.1)\n\nif 0 < s < t < \u03b4\n\n(otherwise consider \u2212f (p\u22121) ). Then f (p\u22121) (s)/s > f (p\u22121) (t)/t if 0 < s < t < \u03b4. So\nf (p\u22121) (t)\nf (p\u22121) (t)\n= sup\n=: a \u2208 R \u222a {+\u221e}.\nt\u05810\nt\nt\n0<t<\u03b4\nlim\n\n\fSMOOTH ROOTS OF HYPERBOLIC POLYNOMIALS\n\n3\n\nBy Taylor's formula, for each t > 0 there is a 0 < \u03be(t) < t such that\nf (t) = tp\u22121 *\n\nf (p\u22121) (\u03be(t))\n.\n(p \u2212 1)!\n\nBy (2.2.1), we have f (p\u22121) (\u03be(t)) > f (p\u22121) (t), and, thus,\nf (t)\nf (p\u22121) (t)\n< (p \u2212 1)! * p .\nt\nt\nBy (1), the right-hand side is convergent as t \u0581 0. So a < +\u221e.\nBy (3), f (p) is strictly monotonic for small t, say, t < \u01eb. We may conclude that\nlimt\u05810 f (p) (t) is given by either sup0<t<\u01eb f (p) (t) or inf 0<t<\u01eb f (p) (t). By Taylor's\nformula, for each n \u2208 N>0 , there is a 0 < \u03bd(n) < 1/n such that\nf (p) (\u03bd(n)) = p! *\n\nf ( n1 )\n= p! * g( n1 ) \u2192 p! * g(0)\n( n1 )p\n\nas n \u2192 \u221e,\n\nwhere g(t) := f (t)/tp is continuous by (1). Hence, limt\u05810 f (p) (t) = p! * g(0). By the\nmean value theorem, we obtain\na = lim\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nf (p\u22121) ( n1 )\n1\nn\n\n= lim f (p) (\u03b6(n)) = p! * g(0),\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nwhere 0 < \u03b6(n) < 1/n. (Note that, if f (p) = 0 identically, then g(0) = 0.)\nIn a similar way one proves that limt\u05800 f (p\u22121) (t)/t = limt\u05800 f (p) (t) = p! * g(0).\nSo f \u2208 C p (I).\n\u0003\n2.3. Example. Note that condition (3) in lemma 2.2 is necessary: The function\n2\n4\nf (t) := e\u22121/t sin2 (e1/t ), f (0) := 0, satisfies m0 (f ) = \u221e and is C \u221e off 0, but it is\nnot C 1 in any neighborhood of 0.\nS\n2.4.

If we write definable we will always mean M-definable.\n2.5. Lemma.

RAINER\n\nProof. (1) follows from lemma 2.2 and the Monotonicity theorem (e.g. [12]).\n(2) We use induction on m. The statement for m = 0 is trivial. Suppose that\nm > 0. By induction hypothesis, g(t) := tm\u22121 f (t) belongs to C p+m\u22121 (I) and\nh(p+m\u22121) (t) = tg (p+m\u22121) (t) + (p + m \u2212 1)g (p+m\u22122) (t). Thus\nh(p+m\u22121) (t) \u2212 h(p+m\u22121) (0)\n= (p + m)g (p+m\u22121) (0).\nt\u21920\nt\nLet t > 0. By definability, h(p+m) (t) exists and is either a constant a or strictly\nmonotonic for small t, say, t < \u01eb. Hence, limt\u05810 h(p+m) (t) is given by either a,\nsup0<t<\u01eb h(p+m) (t), or inf 0<t<\u01eb h(p+m) (t). By the mean value theorem, for each\nn \u2208 N>0 , there is a 0 < \u03bd(n) < 1/n such that\nlim\n\nh(p+m) (\u03bd(n)) =\n\nh(p+m\u22121) ( n1 ) \u2212 h(p+m\u22121) (0)\n1\nn\n\n\u2192 (p + m)g (p+m\u22121) (0)\n\nSo limt\u05810 h(p+m) (t) = (p + m)g (p+m\u22121) (0).

In a neighborhood of t0 , consider the continuous\nfunctions g\u00b1 (t) := \u00b1 f (t). Then mt0 (g\u00b1 ) = \u221e. By lemma 2.5(1), for each p,\nthere is a neighborhood Ip of t0 such that the roots g\u00b1 are C p on Ip .

However, it is convenient to prove\nthis preliminary result parallel to the C \u221e case and strengthen it in theorem 5.2\nbelow.\nProof. We prove (1) and (2) simultaneously and indicate differences when arising.\nAny continuous parameterization of the roots of P is definable, by lemma 4.4.\nWe proceed by induction on n. The case n = 2 is covered by theorem 3.2 (since\nwe may always assume a1 = 0, see (II) below). Suppose the assertion is proved for\ndegrees < n.\nClaim (3). There exists a local C \u221e (resp. C p ) parameterization \u03bbi of the roots of\nP near each t0 \u2208 I. The local C \u221e choices \u03bbi of the roots are unique in the following\nsense:\n(\u22c6) On the set {\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn } consider the equivalence relation \u03bbi \u223c \u03bbj iff\nmt0 (\u03bbi \u2212 \u03bbj ) = \u221e. If \u03bci is a different local C \u221e parameterization of the\nroots of P near t0 , then {\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn }/\u223c = {\u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bcn }/\u223c.\nNote that (\u22c6) is trivially satisfied if n = 2. Without loss we may assume that\n0 \u2208 I and t0 = 0. We distinguish different cases:\n(I) If there are distinct roots at 0, we may factor P (t) = P1 (t) * P2 (t) in an open\nsubinterval I0 \u220b 0 such that P1 and P2 have no common roots, by the splitting\nlemma 4.2. The coefficients of each Pi are definable, since its roots are. By lemma\n4.8(1), we have\nmI0 (P ) = max{mI0 (P1 ), mI0 (P2 )}.\n\n\fSMOOTH ROOTS OF HYPERBOLIC POLYNOMIALS\n\n9\n\nBy the induction hypothesis, P1 and P2 (and hence P ) admit C \u221e (resp. C p ) parameterizations of its roots on I0 which are unique in the sense of (\u22c6) in case (1).\n(II) If all roots of P (0) coincide, then we first reduce P to the case a1 = 0,\nby replacing x by x \u2212 a1 (t)/n (which leaves m(P ) and (\u22c6) unchanged, by lemma\n4.8(2)). Then all roots of P (0) are equal to 0. So a2 (0) = 0. Clearly, the new\ncoefficients are still definable.\n(IIa) If m0 (a2 ) is finite, then p + 1 + d(n)m(P ) \u2212 m0 (a2 ) \u2265 1, by lemma 4.8(3).\n \u0303 2 = \u22122na2 .

C q ) functions a(r),k and 2 \u2264 k \u2264 n. Consider the C \u221e (resp.

We have d(n) \u2212 n = d(n \u2212 1)\nand, by lemma 4.8(4), m(P(r) ) \u2264 m(P ) \u2212 r. Thus, the splitting lemma 4.2 and\nthe induction hypothesis provide C \u221e (resp. C p ) parameterizations \u03bbj of the roots\nof P(r) near 0 which are unique in the sense of (\u22c6). But then the C \u221e (resp.

By lemma 2.5(1),\nfor each p, there is a neighborhood Ip of 0 such that the roots \u03bbj are C p on Ip . Since\na2 is definable, for small t 6= 0 either not all \u03bbj (t) coincide or all \u03bbj are identically\n0 (to the left or the right of 0). So, in case (1), all \u03bbj are C \u221e off 0, by the splitting\nlemma 4.2 and the induction hypothesis, and hence also near 0.\nClaim (4). We may glue the local C \u221e (resp. C p ) parameterizations of the roots to\nform a global parameterization.\nIn case (1) the local C \u221e choices of the roots of P can be glued by their uniqueness\nin the sense of (\u22c6). If C \u221e roots meet of infinite order at t0 , any permutation on\none side of t0 preserves smoothness.\nFor (2): Let \u03bb = (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn ) be a C p parameterization of the roots of P defined\non a maximal open interval I1 \u2286 I. For contradiction, assume that the right (say)\nendpoint t1 of I1 belongs to I. By claim (3), there exists a local C p parameterization\n\u03bc = (\u03bc1 . . . , \u03bcn ) of the roots of P near t1 . Let t0 be in the common domain of \u03bb\nand \u03bc. Consider a sequence tk \u0581 t0 . For each k, there is a permutation \u03c4k of\n{1, . . . , n} such that \u03bb(tk ) = \u03c4k .\u03bc(tk ). By passing to a subsequence, we can assume\nthat \u03bb(tk ) = \u03c4.\u03bc(tk ) for all k and a fixed permutation \u03c4 . Thus, \u03bb(t) = \u03c4.\u03bc(t) for\nall t \u2265 t0 , by definability. So \u03bb\u0303(t) := \u03bb(t) for t \u2264 t0 and \u03bb\u0303(t) := \u03c4.\u03bc(t) for t \u2265 t0\ndefines a C p parameterization on a larger interval, a contradiction.\n\u0003\n4.13. Remark. Suppose that m(P ) = 0. Then the roots of P do not meet or they\nmeet slowly, i.e., (\u03bbi (t) \u2212 \u03bbj (t))/t is not continuous at t = 0.

With hindsight it suffices to\nassume that the coefficients of P belong to C \u0393t0 (P )+1 near t0 .\nSince the coefficients of P are definable, the set of t0 \u2208 I such that \u0393t0 (P ) > 0\nor \u03b3t0 (P ) > 0 is finite and\n(5.1.5)\n\n\u0393(P ) := sup{\u0393t0 (P ) : t0 \u2208 I},\n\n(5.1.6)\n\n\u03b3(P ) := \u0393(P ) \u2212 sup{\u0393t0 (P ) \u2212 \u03b3t0 (P ) : t0 \u2208 I}\n\nare well-defined integers.

By 4.12(4) it suffices to show the local assertion. Let t0 \u2208 I be fixed.\nClaim (2). If the aj are C p+\u0393t0 (P ) , then the roots of P can be chosen in C p+\u03b3t0 (P ) ,\nlocally near t0 .\n\n\fSMOOTH ROOTS OF HYPERBOLIC POLYNOMIALS\n\n11\n\nWe use induction on n and follow the steps in 4.12. The case n = 1 is trivial and\nn = 2 is treated in theorem 3.2(2). Without loss assume that 0 \u2208 I and t0 = 0.\n(I) If P (0) has distinct roots, we have a factorization P (t) = P1 (t) * P2 (t) near 0,\nby the splitting lemma 4.2. The coefficients of each factor Pi belong to C p+\u03930 (P ) .\nLet pi := p + \u03930 (P ) \u2212 \u03930 (Pi ). Then pi \u2265 p, by (5.1.1). By the induction hypothesis,\nthe roots of Pi admit a local parameterization in C pi +\u03b30 (Pi ) . By (5.1.2), we obtain\npi + \u03b30 (Pi ) \u2265 p + \u03b30 (P ), hence claim (2).\n(II) If all roots of P (0) coincide, we reduce to the case a1 = 0. So a2 (0) = 0.\n(IIa) If m0 (a2 ) = 2r < \u221e, consider P(r) as in (4.12.1). The coefficients of P(r)\nare in C p+\u03930 (P )\u2212nr and a(r),2 (0) 6= 0.

The condition in theorem 5.2 is sharp: Let p \u2208 N>3 and let fp be\nthe function defined in (2.6.1). Consider the C p,1 curve of polynomials\nPp (t)(x) = x3 \u2212 fp (t)x2 + (2fp (t) \u2212 t2 )x \u2212 fp (t).\n \u0303 3 (Pp (t)) = t6 (4 + o(1)) if t \u2265 0 (as p \u2265 3)\nFor the discriminant of Pp we find \u2206\n \u0303 3 (Pp (t)) = 4t6 if t < 0. Thus, for small t, Pp (t) is hyperbolic. It is easy to\nand \u2206\ncompute \u0393(Pp ) = 3(< p) and \u03b3(Pp ) = 1. By theorem 5.2, Pp admits C p\u22122 roots.\nSuppose, for contradiction, that Pp has C p\u22121 roots \u03bbj . Since m0 (\u03bbj ) \u2265 1, we have\n\u03bbj (t) = t\u03bcj (t) for C p\u22122 functions \u03bcj . But then fp (t) = t3 \u03bc1 (t)\u03bc2 (t)\u03bc3 (t) is C p+1 ,\nby lemma 2.5(2), a contradiction.\n5.4. The non-definable case. Let P (t), t \u2208 I, be a curve of monic hyperbolic\npolynomials of degree n (not necessarily definable). Assume E (\u221e) (P ) = \u2205. We\nwill prove analogs of theorem 4.12(2) and, if P is of a special type, of theorem\n5.2. Without the assumption E (\u221e) (P ) = \u2205, we cannot hope for C 1,\u03b1 roots (for any\n\u03b1 > 0), even if the coefficients are C \u221e (e.g. [6], [1], [2]).\nLet J \u2286 I be a compact subinterval of I.

For each t0 \u2208 I, we can define\nthe two integers \u0393t0 (P ) and \u03b3t0 (P ) in the same way as in 5.1. Again it is enough to\nassume that the aj belong to C \u0393t0 (P )+1 near t0 .

If the coefficients aj of P are C p+\u0393J (P ) , then the roots of P can be\nparameterized by C p functions, globally near J.\nProof. By the definition of \u0393J (P ), the coefficients aj have the right differentiability\nfor the proof of 4.12(2) to work. Definability was used in the proof of 4.12(2) only\nin (IIc) and in claim 4.12(4). The case (IIc) does not occur, since E (\u221e) (P ) = \u2205. In\nclaim 4.12(4), the use of definability can be replaced by the following argument: If\na real valued C p function f vanishes on tk \u0581 t0 , then f (q) (t0 ) = 0 for all 0 \u2264 q \u2264 p.\nThis follows from a repeated application of Rolle's theorem.\n\u0003\n5.6.

Let I \u2286 R be an open interval. Consider a curve of hyperbolic\npolynomials\nn\nX\n(\u22121)j aj (t)xn\u2212j\nP (t)(x) = xn +\nj=1\n\nwith definable C n coefficients aj . Then the roots of P can be parameterized by\ndefinable C 1 functions, globally.\nIf 'definable' is omitted in the formulation of theorem 6.1, then we obtain Bronshtein's theorem [3] (see also [13]). Actually we obtain the refinement of Bronshtein's theorem due to [4]. The proof of Bronshtein's theorem is very delicate and\nonly poorly understood. In the definable case it becomes remarkably simple.\nProof. By 4.12(4), it suffices to show the local statement. We follow the proof\nof theorem 4.12(3) and indicate the necessary modifications. Let us begin the\ninduction on n with the case n = 1, which is trivial. (I) and (II) can be adopted\nwith obvious minor changes. So assume that a1 = 0 identically and a2 (0) = 0.\n \u0303 2 \u25e6 P = \u22122na2 , we have m0 (a2 ) \u2265 2. By the multiplicity lemma 4.5\nSince 0 \u2264 \u2206\n(for r = 1), m0 (ak ) \u2265 k for 2 \u2264 k \u2264 n, and P(1) (defined in (4.12.1)) is a continuous\ncurve of hyperbolic polynomials. Let \u03bcj be a continuous parameterization of the\nroots of P(1) near 0. Then the functions \u03bbj (t) := t\u03bcj (t) form a definable continuous\nparameterization of the roots of P near 0 such that m0 (\u03bbj ) \u2265 1 for each j. By\nlemma 2.5(1), each \u03bbj is C 1 near 0.\n\u0003\n6.2. Examples. (1) The function f (t) = t2 |t| is in C 2,1 (but not three times\ndifferentiable). The square roots of f may be chosen C 1 but not C 1,1 .\n(2) Let g(t) = 1/3 for t \u2265 0 and g(t) = 0 otherwise. Consider the following C 2,1\ncurve of cubic polynomials (cf. [4, Example 4.6]):\nP (t)(x) = x3 \u2212 t3 g(t)x2 + (2t3 g(t) \u2212 t2 )x \u2212 t3 g(t).\n\n\fSMOOTH ROOTS OF HYPERBOLIC POLYNOMIALS\n\n17\n\n \u0303 3 (P (t)) = t6 (1 + o(1)) if t \u2265 0 and \u2206\n \u0303 3 (P (t)) = 4t6 if t < 0.\nIts discriminant is \u2206\nThus, for small t, P (t) is hyperbolic. The roots of P cannot be chosen differentiable\nat 0: Note that 0 is a triple root of P (0). Consider, for t 6= 0,\nQ(t)(y) = t\u22123 P (t)(ty) = y 3 \u2212 t2 g(t)y 2 + (2tg(t) \u2212 1)y \u2212 g(t).\nThen limt\u05810 Q(t)(y) = y 3 \u2212 y \u2212 1/3 and limt\u05800 Q(t)(y) = y 3 \u2212 y. Thus, the roots\nof P cannot be differentiable at 0.\n7. Complex polynomials\n7.1. In this section let I \u2286 R be an open interval and consider a curve of complex\npolynomials\nn\nX\n(\u22121)j aj (t)xn\u2212j ,\nP (t)(x) = xn +\nj=1\n\ni.e., each coefficient aj : I \u2192 C is a continuous complex valued function. Then the\nroots of P admit a continuous parameterization (e.g. [7, II 5.2]).\nA complex valued function f : I \u2192 C is called definable if (Re f, Im f ) : I \u2192 R2\nis definable. We will assume that the coefficients aj of P are definable.\nThe set E (\u221e) (P ) can be defined and has the same properties as in the hyperbolic\ncase (cf. 4.6).\n7.2. Lemma. If the coefficients aj of P are definable, then every continuous parameterization \u03bbj of the roots of P is definable.\nProof. The real and imaginary parts Re \u03bbj , Im \u03bbj , 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n, parameterize the\nsolutions of the 2n algebraic equations with definable coefficients Re P (t)(\u03bbj (t)) =\n0, Im P (t)(\u03bbj (t)) = 0, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n. The family of continuous parameterizations of\nthe solutions of these equations is finite.\n\u0003\n7.3. Theorem. Let I \u2286 R be an open interval. Consider a curve of polynomials\nn\nX\n(\u22121)j aj (t)xn\u2212j ,\nP (t)(x) = xn +\nj=1\n\n\u221e\n\nwith definable C coefficients aj . Then, for each t0 \u2208 I, there is an N \u2208 N>0\nsuch that t 7\u2192 P (t0 \u00b1 (t \u2212 t0 )N ) admits definable C \u221e parameterizations of its roots,\nlocally near t0 .\nProof. Since the coefficients of t 7\u2192 P (t0 \u00b1 (t \u2212 t0 )N ) are definable, we need not\ncare about the definability of its roots, by lemma 7.2. Without loss assume that\n0 \u2208 I and t0 = 0. We proceed by induction on n. The case n = 1 is trivial.\n(I) If P (0) has distinct roots, we are done, by the splitting lemma 4.2 and the\ninduction hypothesis. (Here we use that, if t 7\u2192 Pi (\u00b1tNi ), i = 1, 2, admit C \u221e roots\nthen so does t 7\u2192 P1 (\u00b1tN1 N2 )P2 (\u00b1tN1 N2 ).)\n(II) If all roots of P (0) coincide, we reduce to the case a1 = 0. Then all roots of\nP (0) are equal to 0.\n(IIa) If m0 (ak ) < \u221e for some 2 \u2264 k \u2264 n, there exist N, r \u2208 N>0 such that\n(t 7\u2192 P (\u00b1tN ))(r) (the reduced curve of polynomials defined in (4.12.1) associated\nto t 7\u2192 P (\u00b1tN )) has distinct roots at t = 0 (see [10]). By the splitting lemma 4.2\nand the induction hypothesis, we are done.\n(IIb) If all ak = 0 identically, then all roots of P are identically 0.\n\n\f18\n\nA. RAINER\n\n(IIc) If m0 (ak ) = \u221e for all 2 \u2264 k \u2264 n, then for any continuous choice \u03bbj of the\nroots of P we find m0 (\u03bbj ) = \u221e (for all j). For: Let \u03bb(t) be any continuous root of\nP (t) and r \u2208 N>0 . Then, for t 6= 0, \u03bc(t) = t\u2212r \u03bb(t) is a root of P(r) (t) (defined in\n(4.12.1)), hence bounded in t. So \u03bb(t) = tr\u22121 * t\u03bc(t), and t 7\u2192 t\u03bc(t) is continuous.\nThus m0 (\u03bb) = \u221e, since r was arbitrary. By lemma 2.5(1) (applied to Re \u03bbj and\nIm \u03bbj ), for each p, there is a neighborhood Ip of 0 such that each \u03bbj is C p on Ip .\n \u0303 k \u25e6 P ) are definable, for small t 6= 0 the\nSince the coefficients aj (and hence the \u2206\nmultiplicity of the \u03bbj (t) is constant. So all \u03bbj are C \u221e off 0 (by the splitting lemma\n4.2) and hence also near 0.\n\u0003\n7.4. In [10] we have deduce from the analog of theorem 7.3 that any continuous parameterizations of the roots of a C \u221e curve P of complex polynomials with\nE \u221e (P ) = \u2205 is locally actually absolutely continuous (not better!, see 7.7 below).\nThe optimal conditions for absolutely continuous roots are unknown.\nHowever, in the definable case we have the following best possible result:\n7.5. Theorem. Any continuous choice of the roots of a curve of monic complex\npolynomials with definable continuous coefficients is locally absolutely continuous.\nProof. This follows from lemma 7.2 and lemma 7.6 below.\n\n\u0003\n\n7.6. Lemma. Let I \u2286 R be an interval. A definable continuous function f : I \u2192 C\nis locally absolutely continuous.\nProof. We show that a continuous definable function f : I \u2192 R, where I \u2286 R is\na compact interval, is absolutely continuous. By the Monotonicity theorem [12], f\nis C 1 on the complement of finitely many points J = I \\ {a1 , . . . , an }. Let Ji be\nsome connected component of J. By definability, we can partition Ji into finitely\nmany subintervals Jij on each of which either f \u2032 > 0 or f \u2032 \u2264 0. Then it is easy\nto see that f \u2032 |Jij belongs to L1 for every Jij , thus f \u2032 |Ji belongs to L1 (here we\nuse that f is continuous).\nLet [a, b] := J i denote the closure of Ji . Then we have\nRx\nf (x) = f (a) + a f \u2032 (t)dt for x \u2208 [a, b]. So f |J i is absolutely continuous. Since Ji\nwas arbitrary, the proof is complete.\n\u0003\n7.7. Examples. Absolute continuity is the best we can hope for: In general the\nroots cannot be chosen with first derivative in Lploc for any 1 < p \u2264 \u221e. This is\ndemonstrated by\nP (t)(z) = z n \u2212 t, t \u2208 R,\np\nand for p = \u221e if n \u2265 2.\nfor 1 < p < \u221e if n \u2265 p\u22121\nReferences\n[1] D. Alekseevsky, A. Kriegl, M.
