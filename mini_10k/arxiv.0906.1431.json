Our data reveal a sharp qualitative change in the Fermi surface topology, due to\ntranslational symmetry breaking in the electronic system which occurs at a critical doping level\nsignificantly exceeding the optimal doping. This result implies that the (\u03c0/a, \u03c0/a) ordering, known\nto exist at low doping levels, survives up to the overdoped superconducting regime.\n\n1\n\n\fThe Fermi surface topology and its evolution with doping is one of the most important issues related to the nature of charge carriers and various competing ordering phenomena in the high-temperature superconducting cuprates. The research has been pushed\nforward immensely by the recent discovery of slow magnetic quantum oscillations in the\nhole-underdoped superconductors YBa2 Cu3 O6.5 [1, 2, 3] and YBa2 Cu4 O8 [4, 5]. While the\ngeneral trend is to associate these oscillations with small Fermi surface pockets, the latter apparently contradict the discontinuous Fermi arcs scenario derived from angle-resolved\nphotoemission (ARPES) experiments [6] and their origin is currently a matter of hot debate\n[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. To solve the problem, it is pivotal to understand\nhow the Fermi surface develops with changing the concentration and even the sign of charge\ncarriers. However, direct probing of the Fermi surface by means of magnetic quantum\noscillations has been restricted so far to hole-doped compounds with few selected doping\nlevels, namely to the above mentioned underdoped yttrium-barium cuprates characterized\nby highly ordered oxygen and to cleanest samples of strongly overdoped Tl2 Ba2 CuO6+\u03b4 [16].\nHere we report the observation of quantum oscillations in the interlayer magnetoresistance\nof the electron-doped superconductor Nd2\u2212x Cex CuO4 (NCCO) at the optimal, x = 0.15,\nas well as overdoped, x = 0.16 and 0.17, compositions. The data obtained provide direct\nevidence for a well-defined closed Fermi surface (rather than Fermi arcs) and clearly reveal\nits evolution with doping level. In particular, a dramatic change in the oscillation spectrum\nobserved at increasing x from 0.16 to 0.17 is indicative of a topological transformation of\nthe Fermi surface in the overdoped regime.\nCompared to hole-doped cuprates, the electron-doped NCCO has a few advantages. First,\nthe superconducting state of NCCO is restricted to the narrow doping interval 0.13 \u2264 n \u2264\n0.18 (Fig. 1), where n is the number of doped electrons per Cu ion and n = x due to the\nwell-defined valences of the Nd3+ and Ce4+ ions. Hence, the whole relevant doping range\ncan be controllably scanned by slightly varying x. Second, the upper critical field of NCCO\ndoes nod exceed 10 T [17] which is about an order of magnitude lower than for hole-doped\nsuperconductors. Thus, for any doping level, it is easy to suppress superconductivity at\nlow temperatures by applying magnetic field (Fig. 1). This excludes potential ambiguities\nand complications in the interpretation of magnetic quantum oscillations associated with\nthe vortex state of superconductors [13, 14, 15, 18]. Finally, the Fermi surface of NCCO is\nexpected to be relatively simple: the material only contains a single conducting CuO2 layer\n2\n\n\fper unit cell, avoiding ambiguities with any bilayer potential [5, 9].\nSingle crystals of NCCO were grown in an Ar/O2 atmosphere using the travelling solvent\nfloating zone method and annealed in pure argon at 950\u25e6 C for 20 h in order to remove\ninterstitial oxygen and strain in the crystal lattice. The high quality of the samples was\nensured by structural analysis as well as by magnetic and resistive measurements. The\nsuperconducting transition temperatures (taken as the midpoint of the transition in magnetic\nsusceptibility) were Tc = 23.5, 19.2, and 5.9 K for the crystals with x = 0.15, 0.16, and 0.17,\nrespectively, in agreement with detailed phase diagram studies [19]. The transition widths\nwere < 1 K, 2.5 K, and 3.5 K for x = 0.15, 0.16, and 0.17, respectively, thus, ensuring\nhomogeneity of Ce doping within \u223c 0.25%. Measurements of the interlayer resistance were\nperformed using an a.c. current of 0.4-1.0 mA at a frequency of 67 kHz. The magnetic field\nwas applied perpendicular to the CuO2 planes (B k c-axis), using a 70 T pulse magnet with\na pulse duration of 150 ms at the Hochfeld-Magnetlabor Dresden. While the data presented\nhere were taken at the decaying part of the pulse, they were reproduced, although with a\nhigher noise level, at the rising part.\nFig. 2(a) shows the oscillatory component of the interlayer resistivity \u03c1osc of the optimally doped, x = 0.15, sample, obtained from the raw data (Fig. 1) after subtracting the\nmonotonic background. The oscillations are periodic in 1/B [Fig. 2(b)] with T -independent\npositions of their maxima and minima, whereas their amplitude A gradually increases upon\ncooling. Such behavior is a prominent characteristic of the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) effect, originating from the Landau quantization of the quasiparticle spectrum [20]. It, thus,\nprovides clear evidence for a well-defined closed Fermi surface, made up of fermionic charge\ncarriers. The oscillation frequency, F0.15 = (290 \u00b1 10) T, yields the area of the extremal\nFermi surface cross-section, S0.15 = 2\u03c0eF0.15 /~ = (2.75 \u00b1 0.10) nm\u22122 . This area amounts to\nonly 1.1% of the two-dimensional Brillouin zone, SBZ = (2\u03c0/a)2 = 253 nm\u22122 , where a = 3.95\n\u00c5 is the in-plane lattice constant of NCCO.\nThe whole data set in Fig. 2(a) can be described by the standard Lifshitz-Kosevich (LK)\nformula for magnetic quantum oscillations [20]:\n\u03c1osc \u221d B 1/2 RT RD sin (2\u03c0F/B + \u03b3) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere RT = \u03b1T /B sinh(\u03b1mc T /B) and RD = exp(\u2212\u03b1mc TD /B) are, respectively, the temperature and scattering damping factors, \u03b1 = 14.69 T/K, mc is the effective cyclotron mass in\n3\n\n\funits of the free electron mass, TD is the Dingle temperature determined by scattering, and\n\u03b3 is the temperature and field independent Onsager phase. Figs. 2(c),(d) show examples of\nthe temperature and field dependence of the oscillation amplitude yielding, respectively, the\ncyclotron mass mc = 0.6 \u00b1 0.05 and Dingle temperature TD \u2248 15 K. The latter provides an\nestimate for the scattering time \u03c4 \u2243 ~/2\u03c0kB TD \u2248 0.8 \u00d7 10\u221213 s. This corresponds to a mean\nfree path, averaged over the cyclotron orbit, of l \u223c ~(S/\u03c0)1/2 \u03c4 /mc \u2248 14 nm. Using the\nabove mentioned values for F , mc , and TD , we obtain a remarkably good fit of the experimental data to Eq. (1) in the entire temperature and field range studied, as demonstrated\nby dotted lines in Fig. 2(a).\nThe moderately overdoped sample (x = 0.16) shows similar quantum oscillations,\nhowever, with only about half the amplitude [Fig.\n\n3(a)].\n\nThe oscillation frequency,\n\nF0.16 = (280 \u00b115) T, is almost the same as for optimal doping. Whereas the overall behavior\nis similar for the x = 0.15 and x = 0.16 samples, a drastic change is observed on further\nincreasing the doping level to x = 0.17. The slow SdH oscillations vanish and, instead, fast\noscillations, also periodic in 1/B, emerge at fields above 60 T [Fig. 3(b)]. Their frequency,\nF0.17 = (10.7 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 103 T, corresponds to a large cyclotron orbit on the Fermi surface\nenclosing the area S0.17 = (102 \u00b1 4) nm\u22122 in k-space or, equivalently, (0.405 \u00b1 0.015)SBZ.\nThe markedly different F obtained for the strongly overdoped (x = 0.17) sample on the\none hand and for the optimally doped (x = 0.15) and slightly overdoped (x = 0.16) samples\non the other hand becomes apparent in Fig. 3(c). For x = 0.17, the interpretation of our\ndata is straightforward: the size of the cyclotron orbit is fully consistent with the results\nof band-structure calculations [21] and ARPES [22, 23] suggesting a single Fermi cylinder\ncentered at the corner of the Brillouin zone, as shown in Fig. 4(a). For x = 0.17, we expect\nS0.17 = 0.415SBZ in perfect agreement with our experimental result. In contrast, the slow\noscillations observed at the lower doping levels reveal a very small Fermi surface, indicating\na qualitative change in its topology. This suggests that we do not deal with a conventional\ngradual evolution of the Fermi surface with doping, but rather with a reconstruction due to a\nbroken symmetry. This transformation can be explained by assuming that the commensurate\ndensity-wave superstructure, appearing in the electronic system of undoped and underdoped\nNCCO [23], survives in the optimally doped and even slightly overdoped regime [24]. The\n\n4\n\n\fordering potential splits the original conduction band described by the dispersion [25, 26]:\n\u03b5k = \u22122t(cos akx + cos aky ) + 4t\u2032 cos akx cos aky \u2212\n2t\u2032\u2032 (cos 2akx + cos 2aky ) + \u03bc,\nwhere \u03bc is the chemical potential determined by the doping level, into two bands\ns\u0012\n\u00132\n\u03b5k \u2212 \u03b5k+Q\n\u03b5k + \u03b5k+Q\n\u00b1\n\u03b5k =\n\u00b1\n+ \u22062 .\n2\n2\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nHere, Q = (\u03c0/a, \u03c0/a) is the superstructure wave vector and \u2206 is the energy gap between\nthe lower and upper bands determined by the strength of the superstructure potential. As\na result, the original large Fermi surface is folded and split, forming one electron and two\nsmall hole pockets in the new Brillouin zone as shown in Fig. 4(b). Assuming that the slow\nSdH oscillations originate from the hole pockets and using literature values for the effective\noverlap integrals [25, 26]: t = 0.38 eV, t\u2032 = 0.32t, and t\u2032\u2032 = 0.5t\u2032 one can apply Eqs. (2) and\n(3) to fit the size of the pockets to that obtained from the oscillation frequency, with the\ngap \u2206 as the fitting parameter. This yields \u2206 = 64 meV (x = 0.15) and 36 meV (x = 0.16).\nAlternatively, one could ascribe the oscillations to the remaining electron pocket by assuming\na much larger gap which would completely destroy the hole pockets. However, this would\nimply an unreasonably large gap, \u2206 = 0.64 eV, comparable to that in the undoped mother\ncompound [23]. Moreover, in this case the carrier concentration n = 4S0.15 /SBZ \u2248 0.045\nelectrons per copper site would be totally inconsistent with the nominal value, n = 0.15, for\noptimal doping. Hence, it is most likely that the SdH oscillations originate from the small\nhole pockets of a reconstructed Fermi surface.\nIt is tempting to assign the observed transition from a Fermi surface made of small\npockets at x \u2264 0.16 to a large Fermi surface at x = 0.17 to a topological change at a critical\ndoping level. Although this scenario is likely, at present we cannot unequivocally rule out\nthe Fermi-surface reconstruction at x = 0.17 due to a possible magnetic breakdown [20],\nallowing charge carriers to tunnel through a small gap which separates different parts of the\nFermi surface in k-space. In our case, small orbits on the reconstructed Fermi surface [Fig.\n4(b)] would be considerably suppressed, giving way to the large orbit shown in Fig. 4(a)\nat a field exceeding the breakdown field BMB \u2243 4\u22062 mc /~e\u03b5F . Here, \u03b5F is the Fermi energy\ntaken from the top of the conduction band. While more detailed data is necessary for a\n5\n\n\fquantitative analysis, we already can estimate the upper limit for the superstructure gap at\nx = 0.17 to \u22060.17 \u2264 8 meV by setting BMB,0.17 \u2264 30 T.\nThe combined data of our study and recent experiments [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] suggests that\nin both hole- and electron-doped superconducting cuprates the Fermi surface undergoes\na reconstruction below a certain doping level. Whereas for the hole-doped cuprates no\nconclusive data on the evolution of the Fermi surface around optimal doping is available\nso far, our study of the electron-doped NCCO clearly shows that the reconstructed Fermi\nsurface is present at optimum doping and even persists into the overdoped regime. This\nconclusion is consistent with the inplane magnetotransport studies [19, 26, 27] suggesting\nthe existence of two types of carriers in electron-overdoped superconductors and pointing to\nthe dominant role of hole-like carriers in conductivity.\nOn the other hand, our results apparently contradict ARPES and inelastic neutron scattering data on NCCO. In the ARPES experiments [22, 23], no small hole-like Fermi pockets\nwere observed. Instead, a finite spectral weight at the intersections of the large Fermi surface with the reduced Brillouin zone boundary [dashed line in Fig. 4(b)] was reported for\noptimally and overdoped samples, suggesting no long-range ordering. The recent neutron\nscattering measurements [28] have revealed an antiferromagnetic correlation length \u03beAF \u2264 5\nnm in optimally doped NCCO. However, our observation of the slow SdH oscillations in\nsamples with x = 0.15 and 0.16 starting from B \u2248 30 T implies the correlation length being\nat least of the order of the size of the coherent cyclotron orbit, \u223c 2pF /eB \u2248 40 nm, taking\nthe average in-plane Fermi momentum pF = ~(S0.15 /\u03c0)1/2 \u2248 10\u221225 kg m s\u22122 . A similar problem holds for the hole-underdoped YBa2 Cu3 O6.5 and YBa2 Cu4 O8 : the quantum oscillations\npoint to a long-range ordering, which has not been revealed by any other experiment so\nfar. While further studies are necessary for establishing the exact origin of the (\u03c0/a, \u03c0/a)\nordering revealed by the quantum oscillations, a plausible scenario is a field-induced antiferromagnetic ordering [11]. Indeed, indications of enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations\nin a magnetic field have been reported both for hole-doped [29, 30] and for electron-doped\n[31] cuprate superconductors.\nWe thank W.
