INTRODUCTION\n\nSupersymmetry predicts the existence of scalar partners for all Standard Model fermions. Scalar quarks\nare usually assumed to be heavy, based on direct searches at LEP [1,2] and the Tevatron [3,4]. However,\nmost of the collider searches rely on a large missing (transverse) energy cut, and supersymmetric particles\nwith small masses may escape detection, because they lead to softer events with too little missing energy.\nOn the other hand, decays of heavy Standard Model particles provide a powerful tool to search for such light\nsuperpartners. No new particles have been found in Z decays at LEP-I and SLD. Hence supersymmetric\nscenarios with particle masses below mZ /2 are constrained, as their couplings to the Z boson must be\nvery small. Recently the ALEPH collaboration has reported experimental hints for a light sbottom squark\nwith a mass around 4 GeV and a lifetime of 1 ps [5]. Its experimentally detected decay mode appears\nas a chargino-mediated decay into a charm quark, a lepton and an essentially massless anti-sneutrino [5].\nThese findings have prompted a reanalysis of an old anomaly in the MARK-I data for the cross section\nof e+ e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons: the existence of a squark with a mass between 3.6 and 3.7 GeV is found to bring\nthe measured cross section into agreement with the theoretical prediction [6]. Since the coupling of the Z\n\u2217 Fermilab\n\nis operated by URA under DOE contract No. DE-AC02-76CH03000.\nin part by DOE grant DE-FG02-95ER-40896 and in part by the University of Wisconsin Research Committee with funds granted by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.\n\u2020 Supported\n\n1\n\n\fboson to sneutrino mass eigenstates is constrained by the measured invisible Z width, one must supplement\nthe Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) by right-handed neutrino and sneutrino states. The\nlight sneutrino is then predominantly right-handed. Interestingly, this model is consistent with electroweak\nprecision data and LEP limits on the mass of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson [7].\nYet the existence of a bottom squark b\u0303 with a mass below the b-quark mass and the conjectured charginomediated semileptonic decay has a striking consequence: In such a scenario the neutralino-mediated decays\nb \u2192 b\u0303\u03bd \u03bd\u0303 \u2217 and b \u2192 b\u0303\u03bd \u03bd\u0303 are kinematically allowed. In the Standard Model, bottom quarks dominantly decay\nas b \u2192 cX. Hence b decays are suppressed by the small element Vcb \u2248 0.04 of the Cabibbo-KobayashiMaskawa (CKM) matrix. The new decay modes do not suffer from any CKM suppression and therefore\nhave potentially large branching ratios. Since the light b\u0303 decays only semileptonically, the supersymmetric\ndecay channels increase the lepton yield in b decays through the cascade decay b \u2192 b\u0303E| \u2192 clE| . Here E|\ndenotes the missing energy from the (s)neutrinos. The measurement of the semileptonic branching ratio\nBSL = Br(B \u2192 Xc l\u03bd l ), l = e, \u03bc, of B mesons is a mature field. At the B factory CLEO B,B pairs are\ncopiously produced from the \u03a5(4S) resonance. The measurement of BSL amounts to counting the leptons\nin the final states of B-decays. The presence of secondary leptons from non-leptonic B decays followed by a\nsemileptonic decay of the decay products constitutes a background, which must be subtracted. The dilepton\nanalysis by CLEO [8] subtracts this background using measured branching ratios and lepton spectra. Hence\nit is clear that the cascade decay b \u2192 b\u0303E| \u2192 clE| would be ascribed to the signal rather than the background.\nThe extra events also pass the low cut pl \u2265 600 MeV on the lepton momentum in the B rest frame, although\nleptons from the supersymmetric cascade decays are softer than the primary leptons. The CLEO result\nBSL = (10.49 \u00b1 0.46)% [8] and the LEP measurement of Br(b \u2192 cl\u03bd l ) = (11.01 \u00b1 0.38)% [9] are\nconsistent with the Standard Model prediction of 9.9% \u2264 BSL \u2264 13% [10,11]. BSL is the ratio of the\nsemileptonic and the total rate. In the Standard Model the CKM element Vcb drops out from this ratio and\nBSL depends only on Standard Model parameters whose values are unaffected by a light b\u0303.\nIn this letter we investigate the contributions to BSL from b \u2192 b\u0303[\u2192 cl\u03bd\u0303 \u2217 ]\u03bd \u03bd\u0303 \u2217 and b \u2192 b\u0303[\u2192 cl\u03bd\u0303 \u2217 ]\u03bd \u03bd\u0303. We\ncalculate the rates of these bottom decays and the decay rate for b\u0303 \u2192 cl\u03bd\u0303 \u2217 in sect. II. In sect. III we correlate\nthe b\u0303 lifetime with the new contribution to BSL . We scan over the values of the supersymmetric parameters\nentering the considered decay rates allowing for a non-vanishing sneutrino mass. Finally we conclude in\nsect. IV.\nII. DECAY RATES\n\nAs mentioned in the Introduction, we have to extend the MSSM by right-handed (s)neutrino states,\nbecause a purely left-handed light sneutrino would couple to the Z and would therefore contribute to the\nwell-measured invisible Z width.1 Phenomenological constraints from flavor-changing neutral currents\nfurther imply that the CKM matrix accompanying quark-squark-chargino vertices is the same as in the\ncouplings of quarks to the W boson [13]. Hence the semileptonic b\u0303 decay is governed by the same CKM\nelement Vcb \u2248 0.04 as the standard semileptonic b decay. We further assume that there are two light\nsneutrino states corresponding to \u03bd\u0303e and \u03bd\u0303\u03bc , so that both semileptonic decays with l = e and l = \u03bc are\n1 Still\n\nsuch a scenario with dominantly right-handed sneutrinos might contradict cosmological bounds [12] and one\ncould need additional small R-parity violating couplings to allow the LSP sneutrino to decay.\n\n2\n\n\f~\nb\n\nc\n\n~\nb\n\nb\n\n\u223c+\n\u03c7j\n\u223c\n\u03bdl\n\nb\n\n\u223c0\n\u03c7j\n\u03bdl\n\n\u223c\n\u03bdl\n\nl\n\n~\nb\n\n\u223c0\n\u03c7j\n\u223c\n\u03bdl\n\n\u03bdl\n\nFigure 1. Semileptonic sbottom decay (left) and the decays b \u2192 b\u0303\u03bdl \u03bd\u0303l\u2217 (center) and b \u2192 b\u0303\u03bd l \u03bd\u0303l (right). l represents\ne or \u03bc.\n\npossible. This assumption, however, does not influence the correlation between the sbottom lifetime and\nthe branching ratio Br(b \u2192 b\u0303E| ), because it amounts to an overall factor of 2 for all relevant decay rates.\nWe calculate all decay rates at the partonic level, in the tree level approximation of perturbation theory.\nAlthough b and b\u0303 hadronize, the binding effects are suppressed by two powers of \u039bQCD /E, where E is\nthe average energy release to the final state hadron [14]. We account for these power corrections and for\ncontributions of uncalculated radiative corrections by conservatively inflating the allowed ranges for the\ninput parameters in our phenomenological discussion in sect. III. Further, we remark that our formulae\nbecome inaccurate for sneutrino masses near the kinematic limit. In this case E = O(\u039bQCD ), and the final\nstate hadron moves too slowly in the rest frame of the decaying hadron. Therefore naive perturbation theory\nbreaks down. Yet we will see in sect. III that in this region it is hard to accommodate for the conjectured\nsbottom lifetime.\nWe denote the light sbottom and light sneutrino mass eigenstates by b\u03031 and \u03bd\u03031 . The mixing angle \u03b8b\nrelating b\u03031 to scalar partners of the chiral b-fields is defined as b\u03031 = cos \u03b8b b\u0303L + sin \u03b8b b\u0303R , with an analogous\ndefinition for the sneutrino mixing angle \u03b8\u03bd . We adopt the standard notation [15] for the MSSM mass\nparameters and mixing matrices: the chargino mass matrix is diagonalized as\n!\n\u221a\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2m\nM\nsin\n\u03b2\n2\nW\nT\n\u221a\n= U diag m\u03c7\u0303+ V.\nMc =\n(1)\nj\n2mW cos \u03b2\n\u03bc\nBy convention M2 > 0 and \u03c7\u0303+\n1 is the lighter chargino. Since we are not interested in CP violation here,\nwe choose all mass matrices and the unitary mixing matrices U and V real. tan \u03b2 is the ratio of the Higgs\nvacuum expectation values. The neutralino mass matrix reads\nM1\n0 \u2212 mZ sw cos \u03b2\nmZ sw sin \u03b2\n\uf8ec\n\u0011\n\u0010\n0\nM2\nmZ cw cos \u03b2 \u2212mZ cw sin \u03b2 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 = N T diag m\u03c7\u03030 N ,\n\uf8ec\nj\n\uf8ed \u2212mZ sw cos \u03b2\nmZ cw cos \u03b2\n0\n\u2212\u03bc \uf8f8\nmZ sw sin \u03b2 \u2212mZ cw sin \u03b2\n\u2212\u03bc\n0\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n(2)\n\nwhere sw , cw are the sine and cosine of the weak mixing angle. We choose N as an orthogonal matrix. Then\nthe mass eigenvalues can be negative and the physical neutralino masses are their absolute values.\nThe decay b\u03031 \u2192 cl\u03bd\u03031\u2217 is depicted in the left diagram of Fig. 1.

(9) and eq. (10) with eq. (5) one can also identify the terms in\nthe sbottom and bottom decay amplitudes which are related by electroweak SU(2) symmetry. The SU(2)\nsymmetry leads to a high correlation between the two decay modes: if one picks SUSY parameters keeping\nK large enough to accommodate the lifetime observed in [5], one cannot simultaneously make both KR and\nKL arbitrarily small.\nAfter summing the decay rates for the two decay modes, each lepton flavor l = e, \u03bc gives a new\ncontribution to the bottom width of\n\u0010\n\n\u2206\u0393 \u2261 \u0393 b \u2192 b\u03031 (\u03bd \u03bd\u03031\u2217 + \u03bd \u03bd\u03031 )\n\n\u0011\n\n=\n\n\u0011\n|KR |2 + |KL |2 \u0010\nq\nm\n,\nm\n,\nm\nb\n\u03bd\u0303\n1 .\nb\u03031\n64mb \u03c0 5\n\n(11)\n\nHere the space space integral reads\nq (M, m1 , m2 ) =\n\nZ\n\nd3 ~p1 d3 p~2 d3 ~p3 (4)\n\u03b4 (P \u2212 p1 \u2212 p2 \u2212 p3 ) P * p3 = M 4 q (1, x1 , x2 ) ,\n2E1 2E2 2E3\n\nwhere again p23 = 0, p21,2 = m21,2 and P 2 = M 2 .

Hence the signal of a b decay into a light sbottom would basically be an\nincrease of the semileptonic branching ratio BSL and a shift of the lepton spectrum to lower energies as\ndiscussed in the Introduction. Therefore it is useful to normalize \u2206\u0393 to the semileptonic decay rate \u0393SL\nof the B meson (which to order \u039b2QCD /m2b coincides with the semileptonic decay rate of the b quark [14]).\nThe experimental value for \u0393SL is obtained by dividing the measured BSL = (10.49 \u00b1 0.46)% [8] by the\nmeasured lifetime \u03c4B = 1.55 \u00b1 0.03 ps\u22121 [20]:\n\u0393SL = \u0393(B \u2192 Xc l+ \u03bdl ) = (4.45 \u00b1 0.21) * 10\u221214 GeV\nper lepton flavor l = e or \u03bc. SUSY parameters yielding \u2206\u0393 > 5 are already excluded from the measured\nB lifetime alone: since the total branching ratio into light leptons is 2BSL \u2243 20%, \u2206\u0393 would exceed the\ntotal decay rate 1/\u03c4B in these scenarios. We further remark that the decay mode b \u2192 b\u03031 E| \u2192 clE| would\nalso influence the determination of Vcb , which enters our analysis of the sbottom lifetime, from inclusive\nsemileptonic decays. The true value of Vcb would be somewhat lower than the Standard Model value of\n0.04 and our exclusion plots in the following section would become even more restrictive. On the other\nhand, measurements of Vcb from exclusive decays near the kinematic endpoint are less affected because of\nthe softer leptons from the supersymmetric decays.\nIII. MSSM PARAMETER SPACE\n\nTo determine how the semileptonic sbottom and the bottom decay widths are related, we perform an\nMSSM parameter scan: for all models leading to a sbottom lifetime between 0.5 and 2 ps we compute\nthe additional semileptonic bottom decay width \u2206\u0393 and compare it to the measured value, as shown in\nFig. 2(a,b). In the scan we assume a sbottom mass of 3.5 GeV and fix the presumably small [5] sneutrino\nLSP mass to 0.3 GeV. Disregarding the large theoretical errors we emphasize that the results of the analysis\nbecome dependent on the sneutrino mass only close to threshold. For reasons discussed below, the case\n\u03bc > 0 hardly ever leads to a sbottom lifetime below 2 ps, whereas \u03bc < 0 generates a rich variety of\nscenarios. In particular, the case \u03bc > 0 cannot accommodate sneutrino masses above 0.5 GeV.\nWe note that all Yukawa couplings contributing to the considered decays are enhanced by tan \u03b2. i.e. to\nreach the measured sbottom lifetime one is automatically driven into the large tan \u03b2 regime. We in fact\nobserve that varying all other input parameters in the given ranges only allows values of tan \u03b2 > 15 for\n\u03bc < 0 and tan \u03b2 > 25 for \u03bc > 0. As an upper limit we choose tan \u03b2 = 60. Since both the bottom and the\n6\n\n\fsbottom decay widths are enhanced, the minimal \u2206\u0393 in the scan depends only weakly on the value of tan \u03b2\nin the given interval.\nThe parameters determining the masses of the virtual charginos and neutralinos are M2 and \u03bc. In\naddition the Higgsino mass parameter enters into the correction to the bottom Yukawa coupling: for positive\nvalues of \u03bc the mass correction \u2206mb is positive, leading to a decrease in hb and therefore a decrease in the\nsbottom decay width until the gaugino coupling to the sbottom becomes dominant, at the expense of the\ntotal decay width. For \u03bc < 0 the mass correction becomes negative. Values around \u2206mb = \u22121 dramatically\nincrease the Yukawa coupling2. A comparison of scenarios with the two signs of \u03bc in Fig. 2(a,b) shows that\nthe impact of the increased Yukawa coupling leads to an enhancement by a factor of two in the typical\nsbottom lifetime.\nSince the sbottom decays through a virtual chargino, either M2 or |\u03bc| has to be sufficiently small, to keep\nthe suppression moderate. For \u03bc > 0 both parameters |\u03bc| and M2 have to to be smaller than 400 GeV. The\nlight chargino mass, which we require to respect the LEP lower limit of 103 GeV3 , is found to be smaller\nthan 140 GeV. In the less constrained case of \u03bc < 0 only M2 has a strict upper limit of 500 GeV, but\n> 500 GeV require M2 < 250 GeV. The upper limit for the mass of the light chargino\nlarge values of |\u03bc| \u223c\n\u223c\nbecomes 350 GeV. We vary the additional Bino mass parameter M1 between \u22131 TeV to always cover the\ndecoupling point M1 = \u2212M2 t2w , as described in sect.II. In Fig.2(c,d) we show that \u2206\u0393 < 50\u0393SL can only\nbe achieved for parameters close to this decoupling point. In particular for the Yukawa coupling dominated\nmodels with \u03bc < 0 we observe a sharp decrease in the minimum value for \u2206\u0393. The numerical width of\nthe allowed parameter region is shown in Fig. 2(e,f). With cos \u03b8b \u223c 1.0 the \u03bd\u0304 \u03bd\u03031 decay channel dominates.\nFor M1 = \u2212M2 t2w the Yukawa contribution vanishes, and the corresponding gauge coupling proportional to\nsin \u03b8b leads to negligible values of \u2206\u0393. In the other decay channel \u03bd \u03bd\u03031\u2217 the gauge coupling is enhanced by\ncos \u03b8b and thereby rescues the total MSSM contribution to the semileptonic decay width. However, typical\nvalues of \u2206\u0393 become significantly smaller, in particular for \u03bc < 0, where the large bottom Yukawa coupling\nwas further enhanced. By contrast, models sufficiently separated from the decoupling point easily yield an\nenhancement of several hundred times the Standard Model value of \u0393SL .\nThe sbottom and the sneutrino mixing angle are constrained by the measurement of the Z width: both\nparticles have to decouple from the Z boson. A right-handed LSP sneutrino does indeed not couple to the Z.\nHowever, it does not couple to the intermediate chargino in the sbottom decay either. We therefore assume\na fraction of left-handedness in the LSP, parameterized by cos \u03b8\u03bd < 0.2. A small fraction of left-handedness\nmight be a hint for a see-saw mechanism in the scalar neutrino mass matrix. Since both the bottom and the\nsbottom decay width scale with the square of this fraction, we have checked that reducing cos \u03b8\u03bd does not\naffect the result, until it suppresses the sbottom decay widths too strongly to allow for any models with a\nlifetime \u03c4b\u0303 < 2 ps.\nq\nThe light sbottom decouples from the Z for a leading order mixing angle of | cos \u03b8b | = sw 2/3, i.e. a\nmixture of left and right-handed states aligned with the weak mixing angle. Taking into account possible\nexperimental uncertainties we impose 0.8 < | sin \u03b8b | < 1.0. Since the Yukawa coupling to the chargino\nis dominant in most of our valid models, the mixing angle strongly affects the sbottom decay width. A\ncompletely right-handed sbottom is preferred, because it gives the Yukawa coupling a maximal relative\n2 Models\n\nwith h2b /(4\u03c0 2 ) > 1 we reject as non-perturbative.\n3 This limit is based on a neutralino LSP scenario, but the sneutrino LSP does hardly change the signature and leads to\nan increased production cross section. We therefore assume a chargino mass limit close to the kinematical limit [21].\n\n7\n\n\fweight. However, the Majorana nature of the neutralino allows the two decay modes in Fig. 1, which\ncouple to either the right-handed or the left-handed sbottom states. Therefore cos \u03b8b = 1 also leads to an\nenhancement of the respective decay channel, while suppressing the other. Even at the decoupling point\nM1 = \u2212M2 t2w it is impossible to switch off both decays simultaneously.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have investigated implications of recently reported experimental hints for a light sbottom squark b\u0303\nwith a mass below mb and a lifetime around 1 picosecond decaying as b\u0303 \u2192 cl\u03bd\u0303 \u2217 . We have studied the\ndecay modes b \u2192 b\u0303\u03bd \u03bd\u0303 \u2217 and b \u2192 b\u0303\u03bd \u03bd\u0303, which are related to the semileptonic sbottom decay by electroweak\nSU(2) symmetry. At B-factories these decay modes would manifest themselves through the cascade decay\nb \u2192 b\u0303E| \u2192 clE| and would increase the well-measured semileptonic branching ratio BSL of B mesons.\nWe have determined the correlation between the sbottom lifetime and the rates of these supersymmetric b\ndecays. A scan over the entire MSSM parameter space has shown that the rate of b \u2192 b\u0303E| typically exceeds\nthe semileptonic bottom decay rate \u0393SL . It easily reaches values which are up to 1000 times the experimental\nvalue \u0393SL = BSL /\u03c4B . The minimal value is \u0393(b \u2192 b\u0303E| ) \u2248 1.4\u0393SL for \u03bc < 0 and \u0393(b \u2192 b\u0303E| ) \u2248 7\u0393SL for\n\u03bc > 0. Both are obtained for large values of the bottom Yukawa coupling. The minimal values of \u0393(b \u2192 b\u0303E| )\ncorrespond to a small region of the supersymmetric parameter space in which a Zino-Higgsino mixing term\nin the neutralino sector vanishes. In view of the the good agreement of the measured BSL with the Standard\nModel prediction we conclude that experimental anomalies reported in [5,6] cannot be interpreted as light\nsbottoms decaying as b\u0303 \u2192 cl\u03bd\u0303 \u2217 , unless the decays b \u2192 b\u0303\u03bd \u03bd\u0303 \u2217 and b \u2192 b\u0303\u03bd \u03bd\u0303 are kinematically forbidden.\nWe remark here that our reasoning similarly constrains a light sbottom interpretation of the anomalies of\n[5,6], if the sbottom is heavier than the bottom quark. If the decays b\u0303 \u2192 b\u03bd \u03bd\u0303 \u2217 and b\u0303 \u2192 b\u03bd \u03bd\u0303 are kinematically\nallowed, they will by far be the dominant decay modes in most of the supersymmetric parameter space and\nthe observed decay b\u0303 \u2192 cl\u03bd\u0303 \u2217 would be rare. This would point at a much higher sbottom production rate and\nwe presume that the secondary vertices from the b\u0303 and b in these b\u0303 \u2192 bE| decays would have been detected\nin collider experiments. While a detailed study of this scenario is beyond the scope of this letter, we also\nconsider this possibility as remote. The anomalies reported in [5] are essentially only compatible with a\nlight sbottom interpretation, if |mb \u2212 mb\u03031 | \u2264 m\u03bd\u03031 .\nEven if we leave the framework of supersymmetry, it is hard to relate the experimental anomalies to\nsome other bottom-flavored object. Consider any new SU(2)-invariant renormalizable model with conserved\nlepton number: the semileptonic decay mode will then have the topology of the left diagram in Fig. 1. By\nSU(2) symmetry then b decays corresponding to the middle diagram are allowed. The suppression of this\ndecay mode would involve fine tuning of the left and right-handed b flavor components and between the\nU(1) and SU(2) gauge sectors.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nU.N. thanks Marcela Carena, Carlos Wagner and Frank W\u00fcrthwein for stimulating discussions.

The contribution of b \u2192 b\u0303 + E| \u2192 clE| to the semileptonic b decay in 20000 MSSM scenarios, all\nfulfilling the relaxed sbottom lifetime requirement of \u03c4b\u0303 < 2 ps (left: \u03bc < 0, right: \u03bc > 0. The SUSY bottom decay\nwidth is plotted versus the sbottom lifetime (a,b) and versus the relevant combination of gaugino masses (c,d). For\ntwo particular parameter points the variation of the different decay channels with M1 is shown (e,f).\n\n10\n\n\f"}
