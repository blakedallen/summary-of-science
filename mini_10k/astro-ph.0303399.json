The exact age of Cas A is unknown, but recent measurements of freely\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nexpanding optical knots that lie in front of the forward shock give an age of 331 years in\na.d. 2002 (Thorstensen, Fesen, & van den Bergh 2001). Proper motion measurements made\nin the optical, radio, and X-rays show variations in expansion rate from 0.1 to 0.3% yr\u22121\n(v \u2248 104 km s\u22121 ) (Thorstensen, Fesen, & van den Bergh 2001 and references therein). Radio\nproper motion measurements also show inward motions (Anderson & Rudnick 1995).\nThe forward shock in Cas A has recently been identified in the X-rays as a thin, fragmented ring bordering the outer edge of the remnant and exhibiting continuum dominated\nspectra (Gotthelf et al. 2001). The bright ring, at 2/3 the radius of the forward shock, is\nstrong in line emission and is often associated with the reverse shock. There is a paradoxical\ndifference in expansion rates for the bright ring measured in the different wavebands of approximately 3:2:1 for the optical, X-ray, and radio respectively (Thorstensen, Fesen, & van\nden Bergh 2001 and references therein).\nIn this paper, we present the first measurement of the proper motions of the forward\nshock fragments in X-rays. We also present a re-evaluation of the motion of the radio bright\nring in order to provide a coherent dynamical picture.\n\n2.\n\nX-ray Observations, Analysis, and Results\n\nWe observed Cas A for 50 ks with the ACIS-S3 chip onboard the Chandra X-ray Observatory on 2002 Feb 6. The observation parameters are listed in Table 1 and were chosen to\nmatch those of the first 50 ks exposure of the ACIS-S3 chip on 2000 Jan 30-31 (Hwang, Holt,\n& Petre 2000; Gotthelf et al. 2001). We had to recalibrate the first epoch X-ray observation\nto make use of the newest calibration solutions (CALDB version 2.11)1 and to apply the\nnew geometry solutions (geometry file telD1999-07-23geomN0004.fits)2. We used an energy\nrange of 0.3-10 keV to make the images. No exposure correction has been applied to the\nimages. Figure 1 is the second epoch Chandra X-ray image. The difference between the two\nepochs, after normalization and registration, is shown in Figure 2. The diagonal stripes on\nFigure 2 are due to the node boundaries and dead columns on the ACIS-S3 chip.\nThere are two important reasons for requiring the same observational parameters, in\nparticular the pointing center and roll angle, for the two X-ray observations. First, the point\nspread function is asymmetric and a function of position on the chip. This effect would\nhave been very difficult, if not impossible, to remove at the accuracy needed for our proper\n1\n\nhttp://asc.harvard.edu/ciao/threads/acisgainmap/\n\n2\n\nhttp://asc.harvard.edu/ciao/threads/geom par/\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nmotion measurements. Second, the relative scale in the x and y directions on the chip is\nalso uncertain, at a level of 0.07%. This could easily masquerade as a small but systematic\nasymmetric expansion.\nA difference in plate scale between the two Chandra X-ray observations could also affect\nour proper motion measurements. In principle, the plate scale may change for two reasons \u2013\na change in the mirror focal length and a change in the physical chip size. There is no reason\nto expect a change in the physical size of the chip because the temperature was the same for\nboth observations. If the focal length changes by a significant amount, it would first result\nin a deterioration of the point spread function, which is not observed (M. Markevitch private\ncommunication).\nWe registered the two images by aligning them on the point source. The second epoch\nimage was first normalized to match the total counts on the first epoch image. The first\nepoch image was then shifted in RA and DEC with respect to the second epoch image\nto minimize \u03c72 of the difference between the two images for a 7\u2032\u2032 region around the point\nsource. The 68% confidence limit of the \u03c72 distribution leads to an uncertainty of 0.\u2032\u2032 015\nin the registration. This uncertainty translates to 0.005% yr\u22121 at the mean radius of the\nforward shock fragments (149.\u2032\u2032 2). Although the point source was chosen to align the images,\nit is in motion almost due south at a rate of 0.\u2032\u2032 02 yr\u22121 (Thorstensen, Fesen, & van den Bergh\n2001) which results in a maximum error of 0.013% yr\u22121 at the mean radius of the forward\nshock fragments.\nWe identified the forward shock fragments as tangentially oriented filamentary features\nat or near the outside edge of the remnant with very little or no line emission. However,\nlack of line emission alone may not be an indicator of a forward shock filament as there are\ninterior knots that exhibit little line emission as well (Hughes et al. 2000). Therefore, our\nsample may have some small contamination from non-forward shock filaments. In order to\nmeasure the radial motions of the forward shock fragments, we converted each X-ray epoch\nimage to a polar coordinate image using a center 10.\u2032\u2032 12 east and 26.\u2032\u2032 33 north of the point\nsource. This center was chosen instead of the expansion center to make the forward shock\nfragments as \"straight\" as possible in polar coordinates so that measurement errors due to\ncomplicated structures or transverse motions would be minimized. The first epoch image\nwas shifted in radius with respect to the second epoch image and \u03c72 was computed from\nthe difference between the two epoch images at each shift position for each small region\noutlined in Figure 1. In order to determine the errors, we made ten Monte Carlo simulations\nof the Poisson noise for each shock fragment and calculated the rms scatter of the minimum\n\u03c72 position. To calculate the expansion rate for each region, we used the distance from\nthe optical expansion center at 23h 23m 27.s 77, +58\u25e6 48\u2032 49.\u2032\u2032 4 (J2000) (Thorstensen, Fesen, &\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nvan den Bergh 2001). We avoided those regions where the node boundary and bad column\nartifacts would interfere with the measurements. We also avoided radially oriented filaments\nbecause our measurement method is less sensitive to the motions of such filaments. As a\nresult of these limitations, we have not evenly sampled all azimuth ranges.\nFigure 3 is a plot of expansion rate vs. azimuth for the forward shock fragments identified\nin Figure 1 and listed in Table 2. The expansion rate of the X-ray forward shock fragments\nranges from 0.02 to 0.33% yr\u22121 with a median expansion rate of 0.21% yr\u22121 . This is equivalent\nto a median velocity of the forward shock fragments of 5029 km s\u22121 assuming a distance of\n3.4 kpc to Cas A (Reed et al. 1995) and no projection effects. Based on an explosion date of\na.d. 1671.3 (Thorstensen, Fesen, & van den Bergh 2001), the median expansion parameter,\nm, is 0.69, where R \u221d tm and m=1 corresponds to free expansion. For reference, the free\nexpansion rate is indicated in Figure 3. The sine wave at the bottom of Figure 3 indicates\nthe expected corrections that should be subtracted from our measurements to correct for the\npoint source motion as discussed above.\n\n3.\n\nRadio Observations, Analysis, and Results\n\nThe radio data were taken at the Very Large Array3 . The center date of the first epoch\nradio image is 1985.67 and the center date of the second epoch radio image is 1994.87. The\nradio data were taken in B, C, and D configuration at 6 cm. For details on the reduction of\nthe radio data, see, for instance, Anderson et al. (1991).\nWe measured the motion of the bright ring using the angle-averaged brightness and\nemissivity radial profiles. Angle-averaging enhances the contributions of the large-scale and\ndiffuse brightness features relative to the small-scale brightness features. In this manner,\nthe measurements are sensitive to changes in the average position of the fine scale ensemble\nrather than to the average of the individual changes. We have chosen to use the radio images\ninstead of the X-ray images to measure motions of the angle-averaged bright ring for two\nreasons. First, the longer time span between radio observations allows us to calculate the\nexpansion rate more accurately. Second, unlike the X-ray bright ring, the southern portion\nof the radio bright ring is rather uniform over a large range in azimuth (115\u25e6 to 250\u25e6 ).\nTo calculate the emissivity profile, we deproject the observed line-of-sight integrated\nradio brightness as outlined in Gotthelf et al. (2001). The general method is to assume that\n3\n\nThe VLA is operated by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, which is a facility of the National\nScience Foundation, operated under cooperative agreement by Associated Universities, Inc.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nthe emissivity (at least for a limited range in azimuth, in this case) can be modeled as a set\nof thin, uniform shells. We perform an iterative decomposition of the brightness profile as a\nfunction of radius into 1 pixel (0.\u2032\u2032 8) wide constant emissivity shells. The iteration proceeds\nuntil the residual brightness is lowered to 1% of its original peak value. We then sum all of\nthe emissivity components at each radius to generate an average emissivity for the shell at\nthat radius. For this analysis, we chose the azimuth range from 115\u25e6 to 250\u25e6 , using a center\nof 23h 23m 25.s 44 and +58\u25e6 48\u2032 52.\u2032\u2032 3 (J2000) that best fits the radius of curvature of the radio\nbright ring. Over this azimuth range, the radio bright ring is rather uniform. Figure 4 shows\nthe angle-averaged radial brightness profiles and the corresponding emissivity profiles. Also\nshown is the profile of the 1985 data with a 1% homologous expansion simulating the 0.11%\nyr\u22121 expansion rate measured for the bright ring (Koralesky et al. 1998) over 9.2 years.\nWe measured the motion of the brightness profiles by minimizing \u03c72 of the difference\nbetween the profiles at each epoch as a function of radial shift and amplitude scaling factor.\nFor the emissivity profiles, we split the azimuth range into five segments and then minimized\nthe variance of the differences between the profiles at each epoch as a function of radial shift\nand amplitude scaling factor for each segment. We only used the inside edge and peak of\nthe emissivity profiles because the position of the sharp rise could be measured accurately.\nThe new measurements of the angle-averaged brightness and emissivity profiles of the\nradio bright ring show expansion rates of 0.02 \u00b1 0.03% yr\u22121 and 0.07 \u00b1 0.03% yr\u22121 , respectively. We consider the emissivity profile measurements to be more reliable than the\nbrightness profiles since they proved to be robust to changes in amplitude scale. Also, the\nmore rapid fading of the bright ring, compared to the plateau, will bias the proper motion\nmeasurements of the brightness profile.\n\n4.\n\nExpansion Measurement Comparisons\n\nTable 3 is a summary of the most recent X-ray, optical, and radio expansion rate measurements. For completeness, expansion parameters, expansion timescales, and velocities\n(using a distance of 3.4 kpc) are also shown along with average Doppler velocities where\nappropriate.\nAlthough ours is the first direct measurement of the forward shock expansion, inferred\nforward shock velocities have been reported. Vink et al. (1998) assumed (correctly) that\nthe X-ray bright ring expansion rate is the same as the forward shock expansion rate and\nderived a velocity of 5200 km s\u22121 . Willingale et al. (2002) use X-ray Doppler measurements\nto infer a forward shock velocity of 4000 km s\u22121 \u2013 20% less than our measurement for the\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nforward shock fragments.\nThere have been many expansion measurements of the bright ring, with most sensitive to\nsmall-scale features. The expansion rates for the different wavebands are in the approximate\nratio of 3:2:1 for the optical, X-ray, and radio respectively (Thorstensen, Fesen, & van\nden Bergh 2001 and references therein) indicating various degrees of deceleration for the\nmaterial emitting in those wavebands. Our new expansion measurement for the radio bright\nring using the large-scale, diffuse emission is slower than the other measures of the bright\nring. The radio bright ring small-scale expansion measurements with azimuthal variations\nare indicated in Figure 3 as well as the median value of the X-ray bright ring small-scale\nexpansion measurements.\nThe bulk expansion of Cas A has been measured in the radio using the Bessel function\nnulls in the visibility plane (which is the Fourier transform of the sky brightness distribution).\nThe reported expansions of \u22480.11% yr\u22121 (Anderson & Rudnick 1995) and \u22480.22% yr\u22121\n(Ag\u00fceros & Green 1999) are higher than our new angle-averaged emissivity expansion rate\n(0.07% yr\u22121 ). The cause of this discrepancy is likely due to the more rapid fading of the\nbright ring compared to the plateau. The positions of the nulls are affected by the differential\nchange in brightness causing a bias towards higher expansion rates. A direct comparison\nwith our measurements is therefore not possible at this stage.\n\n5.\n\nDiscussion\n\nFor the purpose of this discussion, we will assume that the outer, thin X-ray continuum\nfragments represent the forward shock (Gotthelf et al. 2001). Then, in an effort to understand\nthe dynamical picture presented by the expansion measurements of the X-ray and radio\nbright ring small-scale features and the angle-averaged radio bright ring emissivity profile,\nwe use a dynamical simulation by Truelove & McKee (1999) that follows the forward and\nreverse shock evolution of nonradiative SNRs. Their simulations trace SNR evolution from\nthe self-similar ejecta-dominated stage to the self-similar Sedov-Taylor stage with a period\nof non\u2013self-similar behavior in between. They concentrate on spherically symmetric ejecta\nprofiles described by power-law density profiles expanding into a uniform ambient medium.\nFor an initial first order comparison, we use their analytical solutions for evolution in a\nuniform ambient medium with a uniform ejecta profile (both described by a density powerlaw index (n for ejecta, s for ambient medium) of 0) which is plotted in Figure 5. Hereafter,\nthis simulation will be referred to as T&M(0,0). Although a higher ejecta density profile\n(n \u2265 7) is expected for core collapse SNe, the solutions at n = 7 are very similar to the\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nn = 0 solutions during the Sedov-Taylor stage and thus do not change our conclusions.\nAlthough Truelove & McKee use dimensionless units, we have normalized the time axis\nin Figure 5 so that the time when rF S /rRS = 3/2 (the current observed ratio (Gotthelf\net al. 2001)) is the age of the remnant as determined by Thorstensen, Fesen, & van den\nBergh (2001) using outlying optical knots. The radius, velocity, and expansion rate axes in\nFigure 5 are normalized to the median values of the forward shock fragments. Following this\nnormalization, the predicted T&M(0,0) values for rRS , vRS , and reverse shock expansion rate\nare 1.66 pc, 1187 km s\u22121 , and 0.074% yr\u22121 , respectively. The T&M(0,0) predicted reverse\nshock expansion rate is indicated on Figure 3.\nWe can convert the T&M(0,0) simulation from dimensionless to physical units by assuming that the energy of the explosion is 1051 erg and the ambient density is 3.2 cm\u22123\n(derived by Truelove & McKee from Borkowski et al. (1996)). The current age of 331 years,\nas defined by outlying optical knots (Thorstensen, Fesen, & van den Bergh 2001), then results in an ejecta mass of 1.4 M\u2299 , a forward shock radius of 2.34 pc, a forward shock velocity\nof 3595 km s\u22121 , a reverse shock radius of 1.56 pc, a reverse shock velocity of 1270 km s\u22121 ,\nand a swept up mass of 5.9 M\u2299 . The SNR is in the Sedov-Taylor stage and the reverse\nshock has penetrated into the inner, uniform core. The low ejecta mass is consistent with a\nmassive star that has lost most of its mass through winds.\nThe similarity between our new angle-averaged radio bright ring expansion rate and\nthe predicted reverse shock expansion rate of the T&M(0,0) simulation supports our identification of the reverse shock motion in Cas A. In this picture, the sharp rise of the radio\nemissivity profile indicates the location of the reverse shock. The reverse shock being at the\nlocation of the bright ring is not unprecedented. Hubble Space Telescope imaging of Cas A\nshows finger-like structures in the bright ring that are thought to be Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities created in the interface between the reverse shock and the clumped ejecta (Fesen et\nal. 2001). The motion of the emissivity profile would still represent the motion of the reverse\nshock even if there is some characteristic delay between the passage of the reverse shock\nand the onset of the radio emission. The previous measurements of the X-ray and radio\nbright ring failed to measure the reverse shock motion because they were dominated by the\nbehavior of the small-scale knots and filaments (B. Koralesky private communication).\nThe similar expansion rates of the X-ray bright ring and X-ray forward shock fragments\ncan be explained if the small-scale bright ring features represent ejecta in various stages\nof deceleration after passing through the reverse shock. Some ejecta may be moving faster\nand some ejecta may be moving slower than the forward shock. Note on Figure 5c that\nthe fastest moving ejecta are in free expansion and thus always have a larger expansion rate\nthan the forward shock fragments in Figure 3 regardless of their velocity. We also are in a\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nregime where the fastest ejecta also have higher velocities than the forward shock (Figure\n5b). Indeed, dense clumps of optical ejecta are observed outside of the forward shock (Fesen\n2001). Presumably, these clumps are so dense and present such a small cross-section that\nthey are not appreciably decelerated whereas the forward shock does experience deceleration\nby interaction with the circumstellar medium (CSM) (Fesen 2001).\nThe above explanation can be extended to the optical and radio small-scale bright rings\nby considering the physical properties of the emitting material. The optical fast moving\nknots are dense clumps of ejecta, and have experienced little deceleration by the reverse\nshock before they become radiative (Reed et al. 1995). The separation of the optical, X-ray,\nand radio emitting material by dynamical state has also been suggested by Anderson et\nal. (1994) and Hwang et al. (2001). The radio emission arises from synchrotron radiation\nwhich requires amplification of magnetic fields to be strong enough for the emission to be\nseen. This amplification results from the turbulence associated with ejecta deceleration.\nIf significant deceleration is needed for amplification, the small-scale features in the radio\nwould be decelerated the most. Willingale et al. (2002) use a similar argument for dense\n\"bullets\" of ejecta material that have penetrated the forward shock and have formed bow\nshocks in the ambient CSM. The optical emission from these bullets arises from shocks. The\nX-ray emission comes from material that has ablated off of the bullets, been heated by the\nbow shock, and drifted into the wake of the bullet. The radio emission then results when\nthe bullets decelerate and electrons accelerated by the bow shock radiate in magnetic fields\namplified by shearing between the bullets and the CSM.\nAlthough we find that the T&M(0,0) simulation is helpful for understanding the average behavior of Cas A, there are important areas where the simulation and the observations\ndisagree. One is the free expansion rate. Figure 5c shows that the T&M(0,0) free expansion rate is 0.41% yr\u22121 \u2013 36% higher than the observed free expansion rate of 0.3%\nyr\u22121 (Thorstensen, Fesen, & van den Bergh 2001). Another example of the limitations of\nthe T&M(0,0) simulation is in describing the differences among the expansion rates of the\nforward shock fragments. In principle, the evolutionary state of any part of the SNR is\ndetermined from the local ratio of swept up mass to ejecta mass. Those regions of higher\nCSM density should produce more deceleration than those regions of lower CSM density,\nso the radius and velocity of the individual forward shock fragments should be at different\nstages on the evolutionary path. We plot in Figure 6 the radius and velocity measurements\nof the forward shock fragments, labelled by 45\u25e6 azimuth sectors, along with the velocity evolution of the T&M(0,0) simulation. The individual forward shock fragments do not follow\nthe T&M(0,0) evolutionary trend.\nWe also consider a homologous expansion model for the forward shock variations. This\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nmodel has zero velocity at zero radius and the slope is determined by the median forward\nshock fragment velocity at the median radius. Homologous expansion also fails to describe\nvariations in the forward shock fragments as shown in Figure 6. Homologous expansion,\nor any other monotonic relationship between velocity and radius, also cannot be used to\ndescribe the motions of the interior X-ray knots and filaments. The complicated interior\nmotions are shown in Figure 7 where we compare a 0.2% homologous expansion (left) with\nthe actual expansion (right). For reference, the point source is in the center of the circle and\nbright indicates the direction of motion. Both filament C and knot D are moving inwards\nwhile filament A is moving outwards. Filament B is complicated, but parts of it are also\nmoving inward. The motions shown here and in Figure 2 cannot be accounted for with a\ndifferent choice of registration between the two X-ray epochs.\nWe have also briefly considered two models with more realistic CSM density profiles.\nThe first model is that of Borkowski et al. (1996) in which the bright ring represents part of\nthe red supergiant wind compressed by the blue supergiant wind from the progenitor. In this\nmodel, the bulk of the X-ray emission in the bright ring comes from the swept up CSM shell.\nThis model predicts that the velocity of the bright ring is slightly faster than the forward\nshock, which is not observed. Also, the predicted forward shock radius is only 1.07 times\nthe radius of the bright ring compared to the actual value of 1.5 (Gotthelf et al. 2001). This\nmodel is also limited in that it does not address the differences in proper motion between\nthe X-ray, radio, and optical features. The second model is an extension of the models of\nTruelove & McKee (1999) to an n=9 ejecta density profile with an s=2 CSM density profile\n(M. Laming private communication). This model predicts the correct ratio between the\nfree expansion and forward shock expansion rates. However, the predicted reverse shock\nexpansion rate is twice that of our measured value. Both of these models predict that the\nbright ring is closer to the forward shock than is currently measured and both predict that\nthe reverse shock is interior to the bright ring. Future hydrodynamic models with realistic\nCSM and ejecta density profiles should include predictions for the dynamics of all of the\nemitting plasmas.\nThere are numerous indications of an asymmetric SNe and/or asymmetric expansion.\nFesen (2001) found high-velocity, sulfur-rich optical ejecta distributed along the \"jet\" axis to\nthe northeast and southwest of the remnant beyond the forward shock radius. Willingale et\nal. (2003) find that most of the X-ray emitting material is concentrated within a double cone\nthat is oriented at \u221255\u25e6 from north and 50\u25e6 out of the plane of the sky with the northern\nmaterial further away from the observer than the southern material. Rothschild & Lingenfelter (2003) require an asymmetric explosion to explain the observed 44 Ti flux. One would\nexpect explosion or expansion asymmetries to be evident in proper motion measurements\nof the bright ring and forward shock. Indeed, there are significant variations in the X-ray\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nand radio expansion rates of the bright ring (\u223c50%) as a function of azimuth (Koralesky\net al. 1998; Vink et al. 1998), however they do not show the clear bipolarity seen by Fesen\n(2001) and Willingale et al. (2003). There are also significant variations in the expansion\nrates of the forward shock fragments as shown in Figure 3; however we do not have adequate azimuthal sampling to say at this time if the expansion rates along the \"jet\" axis are\nsignificantly different from the rest of the SNR.\n\n6.\n\nConclusions & Future Work\n\nWe have measured radial proper motions for the X-ray forward shock fragments in Cas\nA. We have also re-analyzed measurements of the radio bright ring using angle-averaged\nemissivity profiles to isolate and measure the motion of the reverse shock. Our conclusions\nare as follows:\n1. The thin, continuum dominated X-ray filaments associated with the forward shock\nshow expansion rates from 0.02% yr\u22121 to 0.33% yr\u22121 . Most of the X-ray forward shock\nfragments have been significantly decelerated from the free expansion rate of 0.3% yr\u22121\n(Thorstensen, Fesen, & van den Bergh 2001).\n2. The median expansion rate of the forward shock fragments is 0.21% yr\u22121 which is\nthe same as the expansion rate measured for the small-scale X-ray features in the\nbright ring, twice the expansion rate of the small-scale radio features of the bright ring\n(Koralesky et al. 1998; Vink et al. 1998), and 2/3 the expansion rate of the small-scale\noptical features of the bright ring (Thorstensen, Fesen, & van den Bergh 2001).\n3. The reverse shock expansion rate, measured using angle-averaged radio emissivity profiles of the bright ring, is 0.07% yr\u22121 \u2013 slower than the expansion rate of the small-scale\nradio features of the bright ring.\n4. There is general agreement between the global relations of the forward and reverse\nshocks (median velocity ratios and median radius ratios) and the hydrodynamical simulations of Truelove & McKee (1999) who model expansion of uniform ejecta into a\nuniform ambient medium (T&M(0,0)).\n5. The interpretation of the small-scale bright ring features in the optical, X-ray, and\nradio as ejecta in various stages of deceleration after passage through the reverse shock\nnaturally establishes a velocity gradient between the three wavebands from the densest,\nfastest optical knots to the most decelerated radio features.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n6. The T&M(0,0) simulation does not adequately describe the observed relationship between free expansion rate and the forward shock median expansion rate. Nor does the\nsimulation describe the observed relation between the radius and velocity of forward\nshock fragments at different azimuths.\n7. The motions of the X-ray material at the forward shock, in the bright ring, and in the\ninterior of the remnant are complex \u2013 the interior involving inward as well as outward\nmotions \u2013 and cannot be modeled with a homologous expansion.\n8. Because there was considerable mass loss from Cas A's progenitor, models that include\nmore realistic CSM density profiles such as that of Borkowski et al. (1996) are important\nfor understanding the dynamics of the SNR.\n\nThis work was supported at the University of Minnesota under NSF grant AST 9619438 and Smithsonian grant SMITHSONIAN/GO1-2051A/NASA.

Bright indicates the direction of motion. The diagonal stripes are due to the node\nboundaries and dead columns on the ACIS-S3 chip.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Expansion rate vs. azimuth. Crosses: forward shock (FS) fragments. Double\nsolid line: Koralesky et al. (1998) radio bright ring (BR) small-scale features, line separation\nshows measurement errors. Solid black rectangle: angle-averaged radio BR emissivity, length\nshows azimuth range. Also shown: observed free expansion rate (Thorstensen, Fesen, & van\nden Bergh 2001), median expansion rate of the X-ray BR small-scale features (Koralesky et\nal. 1998; Vink et al. 1998), and T&M(0,0) reverse shock (RS) expansion rate rate (Truelove\n& McKee 1999) as described in the text. Sine wave at bottom: correction to be subtracted\nfrom the measurement of FS fragments due to the motion of the point source as described\nin the text. CCW=counterclockwise.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- (a): angle averaged radial brightness profiles of the radio bright ring for the 1985\nand 1994 data. Also shown is the profile of the 1985 data with a 1% homologous expansion\nsimulating the 0.11% yr\u22121 expansion rate measured for the bright ring (Koralesky et al.\n1998) over 9.2 years. (b): derived emissivity profiles for the data in the top figure. The\nbeam FWHM is 1.\u2032\u2032 3.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.- Dynamical simulation from Truelove & McKee (1999) for a spherically symmetric\nnonradiative SNR with a uniform ejecta density profile expanding into a uniform ambient\nmedium. The time axis is normalized so that the time when rF S /rRS = 3/2 (the current\nobserved ratio (Gotthelf et al. 2001)) is the age of the remnant as determined by Thorstensen,\nFesen, & van den Bergh (2001). The radius, velocity, and expansion rate axes are normalized\nto the median values of the forward shock fragments plotted in Figure 3.\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.- Velocity vs. radius for the forward shock fragments. Solid line: T&M(0,0) simulation. Dashed line: homologous expansion normalized to the median velocity and radius of\nthe forward shock fragments. The symbols represent 45\u25e6 azimuth sectors. No measurements\nwere taken between 270\u25e6 and 315\u25e6 .\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\n\nFig. 7.- Left: difference image between the first epoch Chandra X-ray image and the first\nepoch image expanded by 0.2%. Right: difference image between the second and first epoch\nChandra X-ray images. The location of the point source is circled. Bright indicates direction\nof motion. The stripes in the upper right corner are due to the node boundaries and dead\ncolumns on the ACIS-S3 chip.\n\n\f"}
