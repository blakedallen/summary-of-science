The proposed H-T phase diagram\nfor the [100] direction looks distinctly different from all the other directions studied previously.\nPACS numbers: 75.30.Cr 75.30.Kz 75.47.Lx 75.50.Ee 75.60.Ej\n\nThe model of a Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a pyrochlore lattice has been the focus of theoretical attention for a number of years. The highly degenerate\nground state manifold for a system of spins on cornershared tetrahedra interacting through nearest-neighbour\nexchange prevents a magnetic ordering both in the quantum and the classical limits.1 Further interactions (e.g.\ndipolar) can remove this degeneracy and stabilize a particular ordered structure.2 To date, only two experimental realizations of a Heisenberg pyrochlore lattice antiferromagnet are known: Gd2 Ti2 O7 (GTO) and Gd2 Sn2 O7\n(GSO). The spin-orbit coupling is strongly reduced for\na Gd3+ magnetic ion since its electronic ground state is\n8\nS7/2 with L = 0. On cooling below 1 K, GTO and GSO\ndevelop different types of magnetic order3\u20136 which have\nbeen intensively studied over the last decade (for a recent\nreview see Ref. 7).\nThe application of neutron scattering techniques to the\ndetermination of the magnetic structure in the ordered\nphases of GTO and GSO is hindered by the high neutron\nabsorption cross section of naturally occurring Gd. The\nzero-field k = ( 12 12 21 ) magnetic structure of Gd2 Ti2 O7\nis generally believed to be a multi-k structure suggested\nby Stewart et al.,8 however, this was recently challenged\nby Brammal et al.9,10 . While the zero-field structure in\nGSO appears to be simpler,11 its behaviour in field remains largely unexplored because of a lack of single crystal samples.\nIn this Rapid Communication we revisit the unusual\nH-T phase diagram of GTO. Initial interest in the fieldinduced behavior of GTO was driven by the heat capacity and susceptibility data obtained on a polycrystalline\nsample.12 Later work on single crystals showed that despite a nominal spin-only state, the magnetic properties\nof GTO are anisotropic and that the H-T phase diagram\ncontains three different ordered phases.13 The sequence of\nphase transitions in GTO in an applied magnetic field has\nbeen studied further using several techniques including\nmuon spin relaxation,14 transverse magnetization measurements15 and magnetic resonance.16 Nevertheless, to\ndate, there is no full theoretical description of the observed magnetic phases.\nAll previous studies of the magnetic phase transitions\nin GTO were limited to fields applied along the [111],\n\n[110], or [112] directions, while no data have been published for H k [100]. Here we report on longitudinal\nand transverse magnetization measurements performed\non single crystals samples of Gd2 Ti2 O7 for a magnetic\nfield applied along the [100] direction. These measurements reveal the presence of previously unreported fieldinduced phase transitions that occur in magnetic fields\nbelow \u223c 10 kOe, in addition to the transitions at higher\napplied fields that are also seen for H k [111], [110], and\n[112].\nSingle crystal samples were prepared as described\npreviously.17 The principal axes of the samples were determined using the X-ray diffraction Laue technique; the\ncrystals were aligned to within an accuracy of 2 degrees. Two samples grown and aligned independently\nhave shown no appreciable differences in their magnetization behavior.\nLongitudinal magnetization, (Mk ), measurements were\nmade down to 0.5 K in applied magnetic fields of up to\n70 kOe using a Quantum Design Magnetic Properties\nMeasurement System SQuID magnetometer along with\nan i-Quantum 3 He insert.18 The magnetization was measured both as a function of temperature in a constant\nmagnetic field and as a function of applied field at constant temperature. Because of the relatively large magnetic moments observed, demagnetization effects had to\nbe taken into consideration.\nTransverse magnetization, (M\u22a5 ), measurements were\nperformed using a homemade capacitance torquemeter\nmounted in a 3 He cryostat with a base temperature of\n0.4 K. The sensor element was a flat capacitor formed\nby a rigid base and a flexible bronze cantilever with the\nsample attached. The cantilever was aligned parallel to\nthe external magnetic field. The torque T = M\u22a5 \u00d7 H,\ncaused by the magnetization component normal to the\ncapacitor plates, leads to a bending of the cantilever and\nto a change in the sensor capacitance. This technique\nhas already been successfully applied to the study of the\nmagnetic ordering in GTO.15 The sample for the torque\nmeasurements was cut in the shape of a thin plate of\napproximately 0.15\u00d71\u00d71 mm3 , with its plane coinciding\nwith a (110)-plane of the crystal. It was glued on to the\ncantilever with a [001] axis parallel to the field and a\n[110] axis normal to the cantilever plane.

The arrows indicate the two transition temperatures at TN1 = 1.02 K and\nTN2 = 0.74 K reported from the specific heat measurements\nin zero field.13 The right-hand panel shows the temperature\ndependence of the susceptibility measured on warming in various higher fields. These curves are consecutively offset by\n0.05 emu/mol for clarity.\n\nFIG. 2: (Colour online) The upper panel shows the field dependence of Mk of Gd2 Ti2 O7 at 0.5 K with H k [100]. The\ndata taken for increasing and decreasing fields are almost indistinguishable. Linear fits to the data in the interval 0 to\n10 kOe and 10 to 20 kOe reveal a 10% change in the Mk (H)\nslope at H \u2248 10 kOe. The lower panel shows the field dependence of the dMk /dH curves, obtained from the Mk (H)\ndata at different temperatures and then offset by the specified\nvalues.\n\napplied in the sample plane, thus any demagnetization\neffects were negligible.\nThe temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility in a magnetic field of 100 Oe applied along [100]\nis shown in the left-hand panel of Fig. 1. Both the upper\n(TN 1 ) and lower (TN 2 ) critical temperatures are clearly\nvisible in the data. In agreement with the previously\nreported data for H k [111],19 the upper phase transition is observed at 1.05 K, a temperature marginally\nhigher than TN 1 = 1.02 K found from the specific heat\nmeasurements,13 while the lower transition temperature,\n0.74 K, is identical for all the measurements. The evolution of the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility with applied field is shown in the right-hand\npanel of Fig. 1.\nThe field dependence of the longitudinal magnetization is shown in Fig. 2 together with the dMk /dH curves\nobtained from the Mk (H) curves measured at different\ntemperatures. No appreciable hysteresis is observed in\nthe Mk (H) data. In the highest applied field of 70 kOe,\nwhich translates into 65.5 kOe after taking into account\nthe demagnetization field, Mk is still growing at a considerable rate. The maximum measured magnetic moment\nis 6.8\u03bcB per Gd ion, close to the value of 7\u03bcB expected\nfor a state with S = 7/2 and L = 0. The saturation\nprocess in Gd2 Ti2 O7 is not trivial. At T = 0.5 K, instead of a gradual decrease in the gradient of the Mk (H)\ncurve on approaching the saturation field Hsat , which\nwould be typical for an ordinary antiferromagnet, the\ngradient increases from a lower field value of \u2248 0.10 to\n\u2248 0.13\u03bcB /kOe per Gd ion at Hsat . Although an additional transition at 10 kOe can be seen as a \u223c 10% de-\n\ncrease in the slope of the Mk (H) curve measured at 0.5 K,\nit becomes more obvious after differentiation. Fig. 2 suggests that (a) this transition is not particularly temperature dependent up to 0.8 K, and that (b) its influence on\nthe dMk /dH(H) curves is much more pronounced than\nthe transition at a half of the saturation field.\nThe experimentally observed field dependence of the\ntorquemeter capacitances is shown in Fig. 3. The smooth\ncontinuous variation of the capacitance with an applied\nfield, as measured at temperatures above the magnetic\nordering, is due to a field gradient at the sample position,\ninhomogeneity in the sample magnetization, or a slight\nsample misalignment causing the demagnetization field\nto deviate from the direction of the external field. All\nof these effects are proportional to the longitudinal magnetization. Since the variation of Mk with temperature\namounts to only a few percent over the entire range of\ntemperatures explored, one can use the high-temperature\n(T > TN 1 ) response curves as a background for the lowtemperature measurements.\nOn cooling below TN 1 the torquemeter response curves\nchange drastically. At the base temperature of the 3 He\ncryostat of 0.4 K, the curve has a weak kink around\n5 kOe and well defined, abrupt changes around 10,\n25, and 55 kOe, presumably corresponding to magnetic\nfield-induced phase transitions. The hysteresis of the\ntorquemeter response curves at the high-field transition\nis related to a strong magnetocaloric effect.20 Overall the\nthermodynamics of GTO is quite complicated near the\nsaturation field, but for temperatures below the magnetic\nordering the magnetocaloric effect heats the sample if the\nfield is decreasing and cools the sample if the field is in-\n\n\f3\n1.0\n\nH || [100]\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\nT = 0.4 K\n0.2\n\nM\u22a5 (arb. units)\n\nT = 1.3 K\n\n0.8\n\nCapacity (pF)\n\nH || [100]\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\nT = 0.40 K\n0.0\n\nT = 0.55 K\nT = 0.63 K\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nMagnetic Field (kOe)\nFIG. 3: (Colour online) Field dependence of the torquemeter capacitance measured at 0.4 and 1.3 K.

Since the sample is thermalised\nonly through the 100 \u03bcm-thick bronze cantilever, this\nmay lead to a deviation of the sample temperature from\nthe sensor temperature. The temperature difference estimated from the spread of the transition points is 25 mK\nat 0.4 K and up to 100 mK at around 0.7 K. At low fields\n(15 kOe and below) any hysteresis in the torquemeter response is not sensitive to the field sweep rate, suggesting\nthat in this field regime the hysteresis is not a thermalization issue.\nThe transverse magnetization can be recovered from\nthe experimental capacitance curves as follows. The magnetic torque is compensated by an elastic force, which is\nproportional to the change of the capacitor spacing \u2206d.\nMagnetic torque includes a transverse magnetization effect aM\u22a5 H and a background response bM|| (T > TN 1 )H.\nFor a flat capacitor d \u221d C1 , hence:\n1\n\u221d (aM\u22a5 + bM|| (T > TN 1 ))H\nC\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n1\nM\u22a5 (H, T ) \u221d\n\u2212\nH C(H, T ) C(H, T > TN 1 )\n\u2206\n\nThe field dependence of the extracted M\u22a5 is shown\nin Fig. 4. These curves demonstrate well defined features at the phase transitions. Firstly, as expected in the\nparamagnetic (saturated) phase, M\u22a5 is absent above the\nsaturation field of 55 \u00b1 1.5 kOe (here we follow the 0.4 K\ncurve). M\u22a5 appears below this field and on lowering the\nfield further it vanishes again in a field of 25\u00b12 kOe. This\ntransition field is close to the \u2248 30 kOe transition field observed for other studies in which the magnetic field was\napplied along [111], [110], or [112].13,15 The transverse\nmoment reappears in lower fields and smoothly increases\nas the field decreases to H \u2193 = 9.9 \u00b1 0.2 kOe.

For clarity, the curves are consecutively offset by -0.2 units of M\u22a5 .\n\nthe magnetization component normal to the cantilever\nplane is observed. On further decrease of the field the\ntransverse magnetization decreases almost linearly with\nthe field showing a weak kink below 3 kOe.\nOn sweeping the field back up at the same temperature\nof 0.4 K, this kink is transformed into a more extended\ntransition region which terminates with a sharp feature\nat about 6 kOe. Presumably this region, marked by a\nconsiderable hysteresis, is associated with the reduction\nof the system into a single magnetic domain state possessing the largest magnetization component perpendicular\nto the sample plane. As the magnetic field is increased\nfurther this component decreases sharply by about a factor of 10 at a field H \u2191 = 10.4 \u00b1 0.1 kOe. The hysteresis\neffects at this critical field remained largely unchanged\nwhen the field sweep rate was reduced by a factor of 3,\npointing to the first-order nature of the transition. This\ntransition is almost temperature independent, while the\nkink at 5 kOe evolves rapidly with increasing temperature. At a temperature of 0.55 K, M\u22a5 is zero in low fields,\nthen it appears in a step-like fashion, increases linearly\nwith field up to 10 kOe and then decreases. At temperatures above 0.6 K, M\u22a5 remains zero in the entire field\nrange below 10 kOe.\nThe data presented above, which were collected for a\nmagnetic field applied along the [100] direction, allow\none to construct an H-T phase diagram which looks distinctly different from those observed for other field orientations (see Fig. 5). We associate phase I in this diagram with the zero-field structure identified in neutron\ndiffraction experiments8 as a partially disordered multik structure. At low-temperature, e.g. T = 0.4 K, phase\nI is transformed by weak magnetic fields into phase I\u2032\nin the way that resembles the reduction of a magnetic\nstructure into a single domain state. This process is\naccompanied by a rapid step-like increase in the transverse component of the magnetization forbidden by the\n\n\f4\n\nMagnetic Field (kOe)\n\n60\n\nH || [100]\n\n50\n\nM\u22a5\nM||\n\n40\n\nIII\n\n30\n\nPM\n\n20\n\nII\n\n10\n\nI'\n\nIHT\n\nI\n\n0\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nTemperature (K)\nFIG. 5: (Colour online) Magnetic phase diagram of Gd2 Ti2 O7\nfor a field applied along the [100] axis. The phase transition\npoints detected by measuring the field or temperature dependence of the longitudinal magnetization are marked with\ncircles.

Heating\nfrom within phase I\u2032 to above 0.5-0.6 K restores the state\nI in which the transverse magnetic moment remains exactly zero for fields below 10 kOe. Phases I and I\u2032 are\nseparated from phase II by a first-order transition which\nwas not observed in this field range for any other field\ndirections. The phase boundary is practically temperature independent and according to our preliminary electron spin resonance measurements21 is accompanied by\nan abrupt change of the gaps in the spin-wave spectrum.\nThe transverse moment in phase II (see Fig. 5) is ei-\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nR.

This phase extending to \u2243 25-27 kOe, is\nalso non-cubic in symmetry, and is likely to be equivalent to the low-field states observed in GTO for other\nfield directions.13,15 The field of 25-27 kOe is similar in\nvalue to the transition fields for other directions, but the\nsituation for H k [100] is different in that the transition\nproduces no impact on the excitation spectrum,21 and\ndoes not result in a significant change in the magnetic\nsusceptibility. This transition from II to III is therefore\nsecond-order, unlike the transitions observed for other\ndirections of applied field e.g. H k [111].16,19 The highfield part of the phase diagram (phase III) as well as the\nhigher-temperature phase IHT at TN 2 < T < TN 1 are\ncommon for all field directions.\nIn conclusion, the magnetic phase diagram of\nGd2 Ti2 O7 for H k [100] is established from longitudinal and transverse magnetization measurements. At low\ntemperatures and fields, it contains an additional phase\nwith a lower than cubic symmetry, which separates a\nzero-field magnetic structure from higher-field-induced\nstates. At higher temperatures this phase disappears and\nbreaking of the cubic symmetry occurs via a first-order\ntransition at a field of about 10 kOe. A direct identification of the magnetic phases as well as a clarification of\nthe role of the magnetic field in their formation remains\na challenge for neutron diffraction experiments.\nThe Kapitza Institute group acknowledge support from\nthe Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR Grant\nNo.10-02-01105) and the Russian President Program for\nthe Support of the Leading Scientific Schools (Grant\nNo.4889.2012.2).
