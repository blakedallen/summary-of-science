Introduction\nThe shape and amplitude of rotation curves are directly related to\nthe gravitational potential in the midplane of the galaxy. Hence,\na relation is expected between the main mass components in a\ngalaxy and the shape of the rotation curve. If the luminous mass\ndensity is dynamically significant, the rotation curve shape will\nbe related to the distribution of light. On the other hand, dark\nmatter may weaken such a relation, in particular if the dark matter dominates the potential. Therefore, in principle, a comparison\nbetween rotation curves shapes and the distribution of luminous\nmass can provide insight in the amount and distribution of dark\nmatter in galaxies, and it can indicate how the structural properties of the dark and luminous components are linked. Moreover,\nbecause this link is probably the result of the process of galaxy\nformation, studying this link between dark and luminous matter\nis relevant for theories of galaxy formation.\nThe relation between the luminous properties of galaxies and\ntheir rotation curves has been a topic of study for many years\n(e.g., Rubin et al. 1985; Kent 1986, 1987; Corradi & Capaccioli\n1990; Persic et al. 1996; Rhee 1996; Verheijen 1997; Catinella et\nal. 2006). These studies, however, are mainly based on high surface brightness spiral galaxies with absolute magnitudes brighter\nthan MB \u223c \u221218. To better understand the relation between luminous and dark mass and its implications for the structure and for\u22c6\nPresent address: Department of Astronomy, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742-2421. Email: swaters@astro.umd.edu\n\nmation of galaxies it is necessary to include galaxies with lower\nluminosities and lower surface brightnesses.\nIn recent years, considerable effort has been invested in studies of rotation curve shapes of dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies (e.g., de Blok et al. 1996; de Blok & McGaugh\n1997; Stil 1999; Swaters 1999; Swaters et al. 2000; van den\nBosch et al. 2001; van den Bosch & Swaters 2001; de Blok et\nal. 2001; Marchesini et al. 2002; de Blok & Bosma 2002, herafter dBB; Swaters et al. 2003a (hereafter SMvdBB); Rhee et al.\n2004; Simon et al. 2005; Spekkens et al. 2005; Kuzio de Naray\net al. 2006; Chengalur et al. 2008). Most of these studies focused on the shape of the rotation curve in the central regions\nof these galaxies, because these inner rotation curve shapes provide a powerful test of models of galaxy formation in a cold\ndark matter dominated universe (e.g., Navarro et al. 1996, 1997;\nBullock et al. 2001; Power et al. 2003). Because high spatial resolution is necessary to determine the inner rotation curve shapes,\nthese studies of dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies have\nmostly relied on optical spectroscopy of the H\u03b1 emission line.\nUnfortunately, the H\u03b1 emission is usually only detected in the\noptical disk. Hence, most of these rotation curves do not extend\nto large enough radii to measure the rotation curve shape outside\nthe optical disk. Instead, HI rotation curves are needed for that\npurpose.\nTo date, relatively little work has been done to investigate\nthe relations between luminous properties and the H i rotation\ncurve shape in the dwarf galaxy regime. The studies by Tully et\nal. (1978), Broeils (1992a) and C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al. (2000), which each\ncomprised a handful of dwarf galaxies, led the picture that late-\n\n\f2\n\nR. A. Swaters et al.: The rotation curves shapes of late-type dwarf galaxies\n\ntype dwarf galaxies have low amplitude, slowly rising rotation\ncurves that keep rising to the last measured point. Thus, the rotation curves shapes of dwarf galaxies seemed different from those\nof spiral galaxies, which, in general, have a steep rise in the inner regions, followed by relatively flat outer parts (e.g., Bosma\n1978, 1981a,b; Begeman 1987, 1989). This was confirmed and\nrefined by Casertano & van Gorkom (1991, hereafter CvG) and\nBroeils (1992a). They investigated the correlations between the\nouter slopes of the rotation curves and the maximum rotation\nvelocities, and found that the rotation curves, when expressed in\nunits of the optical radius, rise more slowly towards lower rotation amplitudes.\nTo further our understanding of the relation between the\ndistribution of light and the shape of the rotation curves for\ndwarf galaxies, a large sample with well-defined rotation curves\nand optical properties is needed. Such a sample is presented in\nSwaters et al. (2002, hereafter Paper I); it contains 73 late-type\ndwarf galaxies. For these galaxies optical properties have been\npresented in Swaters & Balcells (2002, hereafter Paper II). This\nsample forms the basis of the study of the rotation curves of\nlate-type dwarf galaxies presented here (see also Swaters 1999),\nand of studies of their dark matter properties published earlier\n(Swaters 1999; van den Bosch & Swaters 2001; SMvdBB).\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2 we\ndescribe the sample selection. Section 3 describes in detail the\nprocedure used to derive the rotation curves. We give a brief description of a number of individual galaxies in Section 4, and\nin Section 5 we compare our H i rotation curves with long-slit\nH\u03b1 rotation curves available in the literature. The relations between the rotation curve shapes and the luminous properties are\ndiscussed in Section 6. In Section 7 we discuss the results and\npresent our conclusions. In Appendix A we present the data in\ngraphical form.\n\nFig. 1. Example of an interactively determined rotation curve\n(solid points) fit to six position-velocity diagrams (contours),\nwhich were taken along the position angels indicated in the top\nright of each panel. The galaxy shown here is UGC 4325. To\ndetermine the rotation curve the position angle, the inclination\nand the rotation velocity were changed until the projected points\non the position-velocity diagrams were found to best match the\ndata.\n\n2. The sample\nThe galaxies in this sample have been observed as part of the\nWHISP project (Westerbork H i Survey of Spiral and Irregular\nGalaxies) which aimed at mapping several hundred nearby spiral\nand irregular galaxies in H i with the WSRT. The WHISP sample\nwas selected from the Uppsala General Catalogue of Galaxies\n(UGC, Nilson 1973), taking all galaxies with declinations north\nof 20\u25e6 , blue major axis diameters larger than 1.5\u2032 and measured\nH i flux densities larger than 100 mJy. For the present purpose,\nwe defined as dwarf galaxies all galaxies with Hubble types later\nthan Sd, and spiral galaxies of earlier Hubble types for which the\nabsolute B-band magnitudes are fainter than \u221217. For a detailed\ndescription of the selection criteria and the general goals of the\nWHISP project, see Paper I.\nThe H i observations on which the rotation curves presented\nhere are based, are discussed in detail in Paper I. The typical\nfull resolution of the observations is 14\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 14\u2032\u2032 / sin \u03b4. In general\nthe signal-to-noise ratios at this resolution are low, and therefore H i maps and velocity fields are given at 30\u2032\u2032 resolution (see\nAppendix A).\nThe sample of late-type dwarf galaxies presented here is\nidentical to the sample of Paper I, except for four galaxies that\nhave been omitted because they are interacting with a close companion: UGC 1249, UGC 5935, UGC 6944 and UGC 7592.\nThe remaining sample, listed in Table 2, consists of 69 late-type\ndwarf galaxies. For 62 of those rotation curves have been derived.\nIn addition to the H i data, optical R-band data have also been\nobtained for these galaxies. Details of these observations and the\n\ndata reduction are presented in Swaters & Balcells (2002). The\nabsolute magnitudes, scale lengths and surface brightnesses as\nderived in Paper II are listed in Table 2.\n\n3. The rotation curves\n3.1. Derivation of the rotation curves\n\nUsually, rotation curves are derived by fitting tilted-ring models\nto the observed velocity fields (e.g., Begeman 1987). In principle, this method can be applied to the galaxies in this sample as well, provided that the requirements for fitting a tiltedring model are met (see Begeman 1987). However, because the\ngalaxies in our sample are often small and the HI distribution\nis usually irregular and clumpy, and because of the limited angular resolution and sensitivity of the present observations, the\nderivation of the velocity fields and of the rotation curves is not\nstraightforward. In particular the possible effects of beam smearing must be understood and corrected for (see also Bosma 1978;\nBegeman 1989; Rubin et al. 1989; Broeils 1992b; de Blok &\nMcGaugh 1997; Swaters 1999; Swaters et al. 2000; van den\nBosch et al. 2000; van den Bosch & Swaters 2001; McGaugh\net al. 2001).\nDue to the finite beam size, the H i emission will be smeared\nout, leading to apparently larger H i disks and to filling of holes\nin the H i distribution. Moreover, as a result of beam smearing the\ngradients in the velocity fields, as determined for example from\nGaussian fits to the line profiles, may become shallower. Hence,\n\n\fR. A. Swaters et al.: The rotation curves shapes of late-type dwarf galaxies\n\nrotation curves derived from these velocity fields have shallower\ngradients as well. The magnitude of the effect of beam smearing thus depends on the combination of the size of the beam, the\ndistribution of the H i, the inclination angle of the galaxy and the\nintrinsic velocity gradients. Despite the effects of beam smearing, information on the true rotation curve is still contained in\nthe data, and may be retrieved if an appropriate method to derive\nthe rotation curve is used.\nTo take the effects of beam smearing into account, we have\nadopted a two-step procedure. First, we obtained the orientation\nparameters and an initial estimate of the rotation curve, if possible from a tilted ring fit, and using an interactive procedure if\nnot. In the second step, this estimate of the rotation curve was\nrefined iteratively by constructing model data cubes, using the\ninput rotation curve and adjusting this rotation curve to match\nthe model cubes to the observed ones.\nBecause for most galaxies the signal-to-noise ratios of the\nfull resolution data were too low to derive reliable rotation\ncurves, we have derived the rotation curves from the 30\u2032\u2032 data.\n3.1.1. Initial estimate of the rotation curves\n\nBefore deriving the initial estimate of the rotation curve for a\ngalaxy, we determined the position of its center. For most of the\ngalaxies it was not possible to derive the center from the velocity\nfield because of the often close to linear inner rise of the rotation\ncurves. Therefore, we have used the optical centers from Paper II\nto define the centers, except when noted otherwise in Table 1.\nNext, the systemic velocity was determined from a tiltedring fit to the Gaussian-fit velocity field, derived from the 30\u2032\u2032\nvelocity field (see Paper I), with the center fixed, by taking the\naverage over all rings, except the outer rings which usually have\nlarge uncertainties. While determining the systemic velocity, the\nposition angle was kept fixed at the initial estimate derived from\nthe velocity field, and the inclination was kept fixed at the value\nderived from the ellipticity of the optical isophotes (see Paper II).\nWe then made a new tilted ring fit with center and systemic velocity fixed to obtain the initial estimates for the rotation curve\nand the run of inclination and position angle with radius. If there\nwere no appreciable variations of the inclination or position angle with radius, a fixed value was used (the average over all rings,\nexcluding the rings with large uncertainties). If it was not possible to estimate the inclination from the velocity field, the inclination was determined from the ellipticity of the optical isophotes\n(see Paper II) or H i contours (see Paper I), assuming an intrinsic\ndisk thickness of 0.2.\nBecause many of the galaxies in our sample are small and\naffected by beam smearing, we found that in many cases it was\ndifficult to obtain a good initial estimate of the rotation curve\nand orientation parameters from the tilted ring fits, especially in\nthe central parts of the galaxies (see also de Blok, McGaugh, &\nvan der Hulst 1996). In those cases, we interactively fit the rotation curve and the orientation parameters to a set of six positionvelocity diagrams1 as illustrated in Fig. 1 to improve the initial\nestimates (one along the major axis, two at a 30\u25e6 angle away\nfrom the major axis as measured in the plane of the galaxy, two\n60\u25e6 degrees from the major axis, and one along the minor axis\nof the galaxy). To assure ourselves we are able to accurately retrieve the rotation curves and orientation parameters, we created\nseveral model galaxies with different and radially changing rota1\n\nThis interactive fitting was done with the task inspector, implemented in the Groningen Image Processing System (GIPSY,\nhttp://www.astro.rug.nl/\u223cgipsy)\n\n3\n\nTable 1.

Except for pure solidbody rotators, we were able to retrieve the input parameters to\nwithin the uncertainties expected based on the noise added to\nthe models.\nIn this interactive fitting, the rotation velocity, inclination and\nposition angle at each radius were adjusted until the projected\npoint was deemed to best match the six position-velocity diagrams simultaneously. Most weight was given to the major axis,\nand least to the minor axis. For determining the run of inclination and position angle with radius, equal weight was given to all\nposition-velocity diagrams. Inclinations of around 30\u25e6 and lower\nare uncertain. We applied this method to the Hanning smoothed,\n30\u2032\u2032 resolution data.\nThe inclinations and position angles as derived from the\ntilted rings fits or the interactive fits are listed in Table 2. For\nwarped galaxies the orientation of the inner, unwarped part of\nthe disks are given. For galaxies with clear differences between\nthe approaching and receding sides, rotation curve were determined from both sides independently, using the same orientation parameters. The rotation curves have been sampled every\n15 arcseconds, and the individual points in the rotation curves\nare therefore not independent.\nFor seven galaxies (UGC 4274, UGC 6817, UGC 7199,\nUGC 7408, UGC 8201, UGC 8331 and UGC 9128) we have\nnot derived a rotation curve, because of a combination of small\n\u2032\nH i extent (RH i <\n\u223c 1 ), clumpy H i distribution and lack of ordered\nrotation.\n3.1.2. Final rotation curves\n\nA potential shortcoming of our method to derive the initial estimates of the rotation curves is that it is subjective. To obtain\na more objective rotation curve and to investigate the effects of\nbeam smearing further, we refined the initial estimate of the rotation curves by detailed modeling of the observations.\nFirst, for each galaxy, an axisymmetric velocity field was\nconstructed, based on the rotation curve determined as described above. Next, a three-dimensional model datacube was\nconstructed from this velocity field and the observed H i distribution at the full resolution, assuming a constant Gaussian velocity dispersion of 8 km s\u22121 . The model was subsequently convolved to a resolution of 30\u2032\u2032 . The datacube obtained in this way\nwas compared to the observations by calculating the \u03c72 value of\nthe difference between model and observations over a small subcube that contained all HI emission, and also by visually comparing six model position-velocity diagrams (like those shown in\nFig. 1) with those of the observations. Although we used the \u03c72\nvalues to find better matching models, we have not used an algorithm to minimize \u03c72 because of the prohibitively large amounts\nof computing time needed. If the match between model and ob-\n\n\f4\n\nR. A. Swaters et al.: The rotation curves shapes of late-type dwarf galaxies\n\ngrayscale, and different models are overlayed in contours. The\ntop panel shows the model based on the rotation curve determined interactively. Close inspection reveals that between the\ncenter and 1 arcmin the model fails to reproduce the observations. The model systematically underestimates the velocities in\nthe central regions. In the middle panel, we show the model that\nwe considered the best match, as found from the iterative modeling procedure described above. In the bottom panel, a model\nis shown based on a rotation curve for which the rotation velocities in the inner parts have been overestimated on purpose.\nThis is also reflected in the model, which systematically overestimates the velocities between the center and 1\u2032 . Note that the\ncomparison of the model and the observation was not done based\non one position-velocity diagram, like the one shown in Fig. 2,\nbut using the entire data cube for calculating \u03c72 , and using six\nposition-velocity diagrams.\nThe final rotation curves are shown in Appendix A. In the\ncases where the rotation curves have been derived for both sides\nindependently, the average of the two is shown as well. The determination of the uncertainties in the derived rotation velocities is described below. In Appendix A the rotation curves are\nalso shown overlayed on the position-velocity diagrams along\nthe major axes. Where applicable, the rotation curves for the approaching and receding sides are overlayed rather than the average rotation curve.\n3.2. Rotation curves for edge-on galaxies\n\nFig. 2. Comparison between the data for the receding side of\nUGC 12732, shown in grayscale, and models of the observations\n(contours), based on an input rotation curve and the observed H i\ndistribution at the full resolution. The input rotation curve is adjusted until the best match to the data is obtained (shown in the\nmiddle panel). The top panel shows the model based on the rotation curve derived by visual inspection, which underestimates\nthe rotation velocities in the inner parts. The bottom panel shows\na model based on a rotation curve that overestimates the rotation\nvelocities between the center and 1\u2032 .\n\nservations was not satisfactory, as determined from the visual inspection, the input rotation curve was adjusted interactively and\nthe procedure was repeated until the \u03c72 had reached an approximate minimum. For most galaxies only the rotation velocities in\nthe inner 60\u2032\u2032 needed to be adjusted. Position angles and inclinations have not been adjusted using this method. For galaxies\nwith differences between the approaching and receding sides, the\nmodeling was done for both sides independently.\nTo verify that our method works, we constructed model\ngalaxies with known rotation curves, orientation parameters, and\nHI distributions, and derived the rotation curves with the method\ndescribed here. As long as there was detectable HI emission in\nthe center and the model galaxies were not close to edge-on, we\nwere able to reproduce the rotation velocities accurate to a few\nkm/s (depending on the noise). Independent verification that the\nmethod works well is given in Section 5, where we compare our\nH i rotation curves with H\u03b1 rotation curves available in the literature.\nAn example of the modeling procedure is given in Fig. 2.\nThe data for the receding side of UGC 12732 are shown in\n\nIn principle, it would have been possible to derive the rotation\ncurves for the edge-on galaxies in our sample using a procedure similar to the modeling of NGC 1560 (Broeils 1992b) or\nNGC 891 (Swaters et al. 1997). However, such a procedure is extremely time-consuming, and therefore we did not use it. Instead,\nwe chose to follow the approach used by Sancisi & Allen (1979)\nto derive the rotation curve of NGC 891. At each position along\nthe major axis the rotation velocity was determined from the\nedge of the line profile, correcting for the effects of instrumental\nbroadening and random motions. The random motions of the gas\nwere assumed to be 8 km s\u22121 . In this method, it is assumed that\nthere is gas everywhere along the line of nodes. Consequently,\nif a galaxy has a ring-like distribution of H i or a central depression in the H i distribution, an incorrect rotation curve may be\nderived. 2\nThe rotation curves for edge-on galaxies derived in this way\nfor the approaching and receding sides separately are shown\noverlayed on the position-velocity diagrams along the major\naxis in Appendix A. The average rotation curves are shown in\nAppendix A as well.\n3.3. Uncertainties of the rotation velocities\n\nThe method outlined above to derive the rotation curves does not\nprovide an estimate of the uncertainties of the rotation velocities.\nTherefore, we have estimated the uncertainties resulting from the\ntwo main sources of error. The first is the accuracy with which\nthe position of a point on the position-velocity diagrams can be\n2\n\nAfter we derived the rotation curves for the galaxies in our sample,\nalternative methods to derive the rotation curves for edge-on galaxies\nhave been published that are more objective (e.g., Kregel & van der\nKruit 2004, Garc\u0131\u0301a-Ruiz et al. 2002). Because of the intrinsic uncertainties in the derivation of the rotation curves of edge-on galaxies, and\ngiven that we do not use the rotation curve for the edge-on galaxies in\nour analysis, we have not rederived the rotation curves.\n\n\fR. A. Swaters et al.: The rotation curves shapes of late-type dwarf galaxies\n\nmeasured. This measurement error depends on the width and the\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the profile. Based on trial and error for\na range of profiles, we have found that the 1\u03c3 error with which\nthe radial velocity can be determined from a profile is about 2\nkm s\u22121 . The 1\u03c3 errors for the points on the rotation curve is\ntherefore 2/ sin i km s\u22121 .\nThe second source of error stems from non-circular motions\nand the asymmetry of the galaxy, which can be estimated by\nthe difference between the approaching and the receding sides.\nWe made the ad hoc assumption that the difference in rotation\nvelocity between the mean rotation curve and the rotation curve\nmeasured on either the approaching or receding side represents\na 2\u03c3 difference. We have added the asymmetry error and the\nmeasurement error quadratically to obtain an estimate of the 1\u03c3\nerrors in the rotation velocities.\nFor the edge-on galaxies we have used the same procedure to\nestimate the errors. This estimate does not include possible systematic effects as a result of lack of gas on the line of nodes. As a\nresult, some of the rotation curves for the edge-on galaxies may\nbe more uncertain than indicated by the errors. This systematic\nuncertainty was taken into account in determining the rotation\ncurve quality, as described below.\n3.4. Rotation curve quality\n\nThe quality of the derived rotation curves differs from galaxy to\ngalaxy. Some galaxies are well resolved, others are only a few\nbeams across. Some galaxies have strong H i emission, others\nare weak in H i. Some galaxies have distorted kinematics, others\nshow ordered rotation. Hence, for some galaxies we could derive\nreliable rotation curves, whereas for others only lower quality rotation curves could be derived. We have tried to quantify this by\ntentatively dividing the derived rotation curves into four different categories of quality q. The quality depends on the signalto-noise ratio, on the presence of non-circular motions and on\ndeviations from axial symmetry.\nThe quality estimates (tabulated in Table 2) range in value\nfrom 1 to 4, where 1 indicates a rotation curve deemed to be\nreliable, 2 indicates an uncertain rotation curve, 3 indicates a\nhighly uncertain rotation curve, and 4 means that no rotation\ncurve could be derived, either because the H i distribution or\nkinematics were too irregular, or because there was no significant rotation.\n3.5. Asymmetric drift\n\nThe stability of a galaxy against gravitational collapse is provided by rotation and pressure gradients. To derive the true circular velocity that reflects the underlying mass distribution, the\nobserved rotation curve should in principle be corrected for the\neffects of pressure. The difference between the observed and the\ntrue circular velocity can be derived from the Jeans equations\n(Binney & Tremaine 1987, eq. 4-33) and is given by:\n32\u03c6 \u2212 32c =\n\nR \u2202P\n,\n\u03c1 \u2202R\n\n(1)\n\nwhere 3\u03c6 is the observed rotation velocity, 3c the true circular\nvelocity, R the radius, \u03c1 the density at that radius, and P the\npressure. The pressure can also be written as \u03c1\u03c32 , where \u03c3 is\nthe one-dimensional random velocity of the gas. Inserting this in\nEq. 1, one obtains:\n!\n\u2202 ln \u03c32\n2 \u2202 ln \u03c1\n2\n2\n3c = 3\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c3\n+\n.\n(2)\n\u2202 ln R\n\u2202 ln R\n\n5\n\nWe found that the velocity dispersions for the late-type dwarf\ngalaxies in this sample were almost constant with radius, hence\nthe second term within parentheses in Eq. 2 can be ignored. If we\nassume that the scale height is approximately constant with radius as well (as is suggested by measurements of the thickness of\nthe H i layer in the edge-on dwarf galaxy NGC 5023, Bottema et\nal. 1986), and if we assume that the H i is the dominant gaseous\ncomponent, the volume density is proportional to the measured\nH i column density.\nWith these assumptions, the correction for asymmetric drift\nis smaller than 3 km s\u22121 at all radii, for all but three galaxies. For\nmost galaxies the maximum correction occurs at the last measured point, where the amplitude of the rotation curve is highest.\nIn the inner parts the correction is negligible, i.e., smaller than 1\nkm s\u22121 , for 90% of the galaxies, and smaller than 2 km s\u22121 for\nall except three galaxies. These are the same galaxies for which\nthe maximum correction is larger than 3 km s\u22121 : UGC 7278,\nUGC 7577 and UGC 8331.\nBecause the corrections for asymmetric drift as calculated\nabove are small for the vast majority of the galaxies in our sample, and because of the uncertainties in the corrections due to\nignoring the contribution of other gas components, we have not\ncorrected the rotation curves for asymmetric drift, and we assumed that our derived rotation curves corrected for inclination\nrepresent the circular velocity.\n3.6. Parametrized rotation curve shapes\n\nThe radial scale of the rotation curves derived above is given in\narcseconds. In order to facilitate the comparison of the rotation\ncurves between galaxies and the comparison between the rotation curves and the light profiles, the rotation curves have been\nresampled in units of disk scale lengths. Table 2 lists the rotation\nvelocities at one, two, three, and four disk scale lengths, as 31 to\n34 . In addition, it lists the velocity at the last measured point of\nthe rotation curve 3last and the corresponding radius rlast .\nWe have also calculated the logarithmic slope of the rotation\ncurves. The logarithmic slope is defined as a straight line fit to\nthe rotation curve in logarithmic coordinates between two radii:\nS (a,b) =\n\n\u2206 log 3\nlog(3b /3a )\n=\n\u2206 log R log(Rb /Ra )\n\n(3)\n\nFor a flat rotation curve, S (a,b) equals zero, and for a solid body\nh\nh\nrotation curve S (a,b) equals unity. In Table 2, we list S (1,2)\n, S (2,3)\nh\nand S (2,L)\n, where the superscript h refers to the fact that the logarithmic slopes have been calculated from the rotation curves\nexpressed in units of disk scale length. The subscript numbers\nbetween parentheses refer to the number of scale lengths, and\nthe 'L' refers to the radius of the last measured point.\n\n4. Notes on individual galaxy rotation curves\nBecause of the relatively large size of the sample, we restrict ourselves here to a discussion of properties relevant to the derivation\nof the rotation curves.\nUGC 2034 has a small kinematic warp. The position angle\nchanges by about 35\u25e6 . Because the galaxy is almost face-on, the\nvariation of inclination angle with radius is difficult to determine.\nUGC 2053 has its kinematic major axis and its morphological\nmajor axis almost at right angles. Its kinematics are reminiscent\nof that expected for a bar potential. The bright optical image\nappears to have a bar-like shape, but no faint disk is detected,\nneither in the optical nor in the H i.\n\n\f6\n\nR. A.

The S-shape distortion in the kinematics that is associated with the bar is clearly visible in the velocity field.\nUGC 7278 has a strong kinematic warp, with the inclination\nchanging from about 30\u25e6 in the central parts to about 10\u25e6 in the\nouter parts, and the position angle changing from 74\u25e6 to 90\u25e6 .\nBecause of the low inclination, the actual values of the inclination, and hence the amplitude of the rotation curve, are uncertain. The H i in the central parts has a high velocity dispersion\nand seems to counterrotate with respect to the outer parts.\nUGC 7399 has an extended H i rotation curve, yet the inner rise\nof the rotation curve is poorly resolved because of the small size\nof the optical galaxy.\nUGC 7408 has little H i. No rotation curve could be derived.\nUGC 7577 has the lowest rotation amplitude of the galaxies in\nthis sample, yet its velocity field is still regular in appearance.\n\nUGC 7524 is a prototype of a kinematically lopsided galaxy. The\nrotation curve on the receding side continues to rise, whereas on\nthe approaching side the rotation curve quickly reaches a flat part\n(see also Swaters et al. 1999).\nUGC 7603 has a high inclination of 78\u25e6 . As a result, the inner\nparts are effectively seen edge-on by the 30\u2032\u2032 beam, making the\ninner rotation curve more uncertain.\nUGC 7690 appears to have a declining rotation curve. However,\nthis galaxy also has a modest kinematic warp, with an inclination\nchanging from about 40\u25e6 in the central parts to 30\u25e6 in the outer\nparts. Because the inclination as a function of radius is uncertain,\nso is the shape of the rotation curve.\nUGC 8201 has most of its H i located in two clumps that are\nroughly located on the major axis, but that show clear difference\nin velocity. No rotation curve could be derived.\n\n\f8\n\nR. A. Swaters et al.: The rotation curves shapes of late-type dwarf galaxies\n\nUGC 8331 has H i in one clump in the center and two clumps at\nlarger radii, making it impossible to measure the rotation curve.\nUGC 8490 is strongly warped. The position angle changes from\n160\u25e6 to 225\u25e6, the inclination changes from 50\u25e6 to 30\u25e6 , and then\nrises again to about 50\u25e6 . This system was studied in detail by\nSicotte et al. (1996) and Sicotte & Carignan (1997). The outer\nhalf of the rotation curve may be more uncertain than indicated\nby the error bars, due to uncertainties in the orientation angles.\nUGC 9128 is hardly resolved by the 30\u2032\u2032 beam, and hence no\nrotation curve could be determined.\n\n5. Comparison to H\u03b1 rotation curves\nIn Fig. 3 we compare the H i rotation curves presented here\nto high-resolution rotation curves based on long-slit H\u03b1 spectroscopy from the studies of dBB and SMvdBB. There is a significant overlap between the samples of those two studies and\nthe sample presented here because they are both based on the\nsample of Swaters (1999).\ndBB have derived their rotation curves by combining their\nH\u03b1 data with the S99 H i data, and then fitting a spline to the\ncombined data to obtain a smooth curve. The dBB data plotted\nin Fig. 3 are the points from their spline-interpolated rotation\ncurves over the range in radii where they have H\u03b1 data.\nThe comparison between the H i and H\u03b1 rotation curves\nshows that they generally agree fairly well, although there are\nsignificant differences in individual galaxies. Below we discuss\nthe comparison of the H i and H\u03b1 rotation curves in detail.\nUGC 731. Observed in H\u03b1 both by SMvdBB and dBB. The\nagreement between the H i data and the SMVdBB data is good,\nwhereas the H\u03b1 rotation curve by de dBB rises more steeply\nthan the H i rotation curve. The difference between these two\nH\u03b1 curves can be explained by the lopsided kinematics of this\ngalaxy (see Swaters et al. 1999). Its approaching side has a more\nsteeply rising rotation curve than the receding side. The H\u03b1 data\nin SMvdBB samples both sides, whereas in the dBB data, which\nis less deep, H\u03b1 emission is biased to the approaching side.\nUGC 1281. The H i and H\u03b1 rotation curves for this edge-on\ngalaxy are in excellent agreement.\nUGC 3137 . The H\u03b1 rotation curve rises more steeply than the\nH i one. This galaxy is edge-on, and has a rotation curve that\nrises steeply with respect to the size of the H i beam. This, in\ncombination with its inclination, makes the H i rotation curve\nhard to determine.\nUGC 3371. The H i rotation curve rises more steeply than the H\u03b1\nrotation curve. The reason for this difference is unclear. Swaters\net al. (2003b) obtained an H\u03b1 rotation curve derived from integral field spectroscopy and find a good match between their H\u03b1\nrotation curve and our H i rotation curve.\nUGC 3851. As noted above, this galaxy has an irregular kinematic structure (see also Hunter et al. 2002). The difference between the H i and H\u03b1 curves could be caused by the fact that\nthe H i rotation curve is derived from the entire velocity field,\nwhereas the H\u03b1 rotation curve is derived from a single, 1\u2032\u2032 wide\nslice along the major axis.\nUGC 4173 . The H i and H\u03b1 rotation curves are in excellent\nagreement. However, the H\u03b1 data by dBB is of low quality, and\ntheir interpolated rotation curve is dominated by the H i data.\nUGC 4278 . The H i rotation curve of this edge-on galaxy rises\nmore steeply than the H\u03b1 one.\nUGC 4325 . This galaxy has been observed by both SMvdBB and\ndBB. The SMvdBB rotation curve is in good agreement with the\nH i curve, whereas the dBB curve rises more slowly and reaches\na higher amplitude. The latter is difficult to understand, as the\n\namplitude of the rotation curve can be determined accurately\nfrom the two-dimensional velocity field. A possible explanation\nis that dBB picked up a localized disturbance in the kinematics.\nUGC 4499 . The H\u03b1 rotation curve has considerable scatter, but\nthere is good general agreement between the H i and H\u03b1 curves.\nUGC 5272 . The H i and H\u03b1 are in excellent agreement.\nUGC 5721. This galaxy has been observed by both SMvdBB\nand dBB. Both H\u03b1 curves agree well with each other, and both\nshow a steep rise in the inner 10\u2032\u2032 that is not seen in the H i data.\nUGC 7524 . This is the best resolved galaxy in our sample, yet\nthe H i and H\u03b1 rotation curves show significant differences. The\nvelocity field of this galaxy shows a great deal of structure, including kinematic lopsidedness (see Swaters et al. 1999). The\nstructure seen in the dBB curve is also seen along the major axis\nof the H i data.\nUGC 7603 . The H i and H\u03b1 data are in good agreement, although\nthe outer points on the H\u03b1 curve fall below the H i curve. As this\ngalaxy has a fairly high inclination (76\u25e6 ), and a steeply rising rotation curve that is not well resolved by the H i beam, it is likely\nthat the difference is due to residual affects of beam smearing.\nUGC 8286 . The H i and H\u03b1 rotation curves for this edge-on\ngalaxy agree except in the region where the rotation curve turns\nover.\nUGC 8490 . The H\u03b1 rotation curve falls well below the H i rotation curve near a radius of about 15\u2032\u2032 . As this corresponds to the\nfirst point on a steeply rising rotation curve, it is possible that\nthis difference is the result of an incorrect correction for beam\nsmearing.\nUGC 8837 . The H i and the poorly sampled H\u03b1 rotation curves\nare in good agreement.\nUGC 9211. The H i and H\u03b1 rotation curves are in good agreement.\nUGC 10310 . The H\u03b1 rotation curve falls below the H i rotation\ncurve. The reason for this difference is unclear.\nUGC 11557 . The H i and H\u03b1 rotation curves agree well, but in\nthe outer parts the H\u03b1 curve falls slightly below the H i curve.\nUGC 11707 . Although the H\u03b1 rotation curve is poorly sampled,\nthe inner rise in the H\u03b1 rotation curve seems somewhat steeper\nthan that of the H i curve.\nUGC 11861. The H\u03b1 rotation curve has significant scatter, but\nseems to rise more steeply in the central regions. In the outer\nparts both curves agree well.\nUGC 12732 . The H\u03b1 and H i rotation curves are in agreement.\nThe detailed comparison of H i and H\u03b1 rotation curves shows\na fairly good general agreement between the two sets, indicating\nthat the method used to derive beam smearing corrected rotation\ncurves is successful to a large degree. There are, however, several\nsystematic differences. For example, the H i data are not sensitive\nto features in the central rotation curve if they are smaller than\nthe size of the H i beam (UGC 5721, UGC 11707, UGC 11861).\nIn addition, if the velocity gradient over the beam is large, the\nderived H i rotation curve becomes more uncertain (UGC 3137,\nUGC 7603, UGC 8490). On the other hand, the H\u03b1 data may be\nsensitive to small scale structure in the velocity field (UGC 731,\nUGC 3851, UGC 4325, UGC 7524), because it is derived from a\n1\u2032\u2032 wide slice through the velocity field, whereas the H i rotation\ncurve is derived from the velocity field as a whole. Systematic\ndifferences between the H i and the H\u03b1 rotation curves are common in edge-on galaxies (UGC 3137, UGC 4278, UGC 8286).\nFor these galaxies, derivation of the rotation curves is difficult\n(see Section 3), especially for the H\u03b1 data, for which the typical instrumental velocity resolution of around 75 km s\u22121 and the\npossibility of extinction along the line of sight make it difficult to\ndetermine the extreme velocity accurately (see e.g. SMvdBB).\n\n\fR.

The left panel shows the rotation curves with\nradii expressed in kpc, in the right panel the radii are expressed in units of disk scale lengths.\nFor two galaxies, UGC 3371 and UGC 10310 there were\nno obvious reasons for the difference between the H i and H\u03b1\nrotation curves. The effects discussed above may all have contributed. Interestingly, Swaters et al. (2003b) have reobserved\nUGC 3371. Based on a high-resolution, two-dimensional H\u03b1 velocity field, they derive a rotation curve that agrees well with\nthe H i rotation curve. They suggest that the differences between\ntheir rotation curve and the dBB rotation curve may be due to\nthat fact that they used two-dimensional data, and the fact that\ndBB spline-interpolated their data.\nBlais-Ouellette et al. (2001) and Garrido et al. (2002) compared rotation curves derived from Fabry-Perot imaging spectroscopy to those derived from H i synthesis observations, and\nfound good general agreement between the H\u03b1 and H i rotation\ncurves for galaxies that are well-resolved. For galaxies that are\nless well-resolved the relation between the H i and H\u03b1 shows\nlarger scatter, leading Garrido et al. (2002) to conclude that\ncorrections for beam smearing have introduced uncertainties.\nAlthough corrections for beam smearing may explain part of this\nscatter, uncertainties in the H\u03b1 Fabry-Perot data will also play a\nrole e.g., because Fabry-Perot are less sensitive to the faint H\u03b1\nemission, and hence are biased towards regions of strong star\nformation, which may be associated with shocks, spiral arms,\nand bars.\nAlthough we argue that the effects of beam smearing on H i\ndata can usually be corrected for the type of galaxies presented\nhere, and that the H i rotation curves are therefore reliable, it is\nobvious that higher angular resolution observations are needed\nto sample the detailed rotation curve shapes in the central 30\u2032\u2032 .\n\n6. Rotation curve shapes\n6.1. The rotation curves\n\nFor the study of the properties of late-type dwarf galaxy rotation curves, our sample has been divided into two subsamples.\nThe high quality sample contains 19 galaxies with inclinations\n39\u25e6 \u2264 i \u2264 80\u25e6 and rotation curves with quality q = 1. A\nlower limit was applied because at low inclinations the rotation\ncurve amplitude and shape are uncertain due to higher inclination uncertainties. The particular value of 39\u25e6 was chosen so that\nUGC 12732 is included in the sample. UGC 11861 was excluded\nfrom the analysis below because of its high luminosity, resulting\n\nin a high quality sample of 18 galaxies. The lower quality sample\ncontains 16 galaxies with inclinations 39\u25e6 \u2264 i \u2264 80\u25e6 and rotation\ncurves with q = 2. UGC 4543 was excluded because of its high\nluminosity. The lower quality sample thus selected contains 15\ndwarf galaxies.\nIn Fig. 4 the rotation curves of the galaxies in the high quality sample are shown. The left panel shows the rotation curves\nwith the radii expressed in kpc, in the right panel the radii are\nexpressed in units of optical disk scale lengths. A striking feature of Fig. 4 is that the rotation curves of the dwarf galaxies in\nour sample look similar to those of spiral galaxies, in particular\nwhen the radii are expressed in units of disk scale lengths: most\nof the rotation curves rise rapidly in the inner parts and start to\nflatten after about two disk scale lengths. Although about half\nof the galaxies in our high-quality sample do not extend significantly beyond three disk scale lengths, those that do have rotation curves that are fairly flat, including amplitudes as low as\n60 km s\u22121 . Thus, it seems that whether the flat part of a rotation\ncurve is reached or not depends more on the radial extent of the\nrotation curve than on its amplitude. None of the galaxies in our\nsample have declining rotation curves, even though some of the\nrotation curves extend to beyond 10 disk scale lengths.\nTo compare the properties of the rotation curves of the latetype dwarf galaxies in our sample to the rotation curve properties of other galaxies, we have constructed a comparison sample of extended H i rotation curves. We used the H i rotation\ncurves of Ursa Major galaxies by Verheijen (1997) and Verheijen\n& Sancisi (2001). This sample spans a range of galaxy types,\nbut has relatively few early-type galaxies and no galaxies with\nMR > \u221217. We only included galaxies with at least 5 measured\npoints in the rotation curve to ensure sufficient resolution. We\nalso included the sample presented in Broeils (1992a), which\nconsists of a collection of rotation curves presented in the literature. It includes a large range of galaxy types and luminosities,\nspanning from MR = \u221223 to MR = \u221215. Most of the photometric data presented in Broeils (1992a) are in the B-band. These\nwere converted to R-band assuming B \u2212 R = 1.0. A third source\nis the study by Spekkens & Giovanelli (2006), who have studied a sample of massive late-type spiral galaxies (their average\nHubble type is Sbc). We assumed R \u2212 I = 0.5 to convert their\nI-band photometry to the R-band. For each of these literature\nsamples we only used galaxies with inclinations 39\u25e6 \u2264 i \u2264 80\u25e6 .\n\n\fR. A.

A. Swaters et al.: The rotation curves shapes of late-type dwarf galaxies\n\n(as was done by e.g., CvG and Broeils 1992a). Both choices\nhave their merits: using disk scale lengths, the shape parameter is measured at the same relative locations in the disks, and\nusing the optical radius the shape is measured at the same surface brightness. We have also used the optical radius to define\nthe shape parameter, and found that the results hardly depend on\nthe choice of the scaling parameter, as was also found by CvG.\nBoth CvG and Broeils (1992a) have reported tight correlations between the shape of the rotation curves and the Hubble\ntype. These correlations are plotted for reference in Fig. 5.\nWith the inclusion of the new data reported here, it now\nappears that galaxies with Hubble types later than Sc all have\nh\nof\nsimilar outer rotation curve slopes, with an average S (2,L)\n0.18\u00b10.10 (marked in Fig. 5 by the solid and dotted lines). None\nof the galaxies in our high-quality sample have rotation curves\nas shallow as seen among the dwarf galaxies in the comparison\nsamples. We will discuss this in Section 7.\nFig. 5. Logarithmic slope of the rotation curve between 2 disk\nh\nscale lengths and the last measured point S (2,L)\nversus the numeric Hubble type. Only galaxies for which the last measured\npoint lies beyond 3 disk scale lengths and with inclinations between 39\u25e6 and 80\u25e6 have been plotted. A random value between\n-0.5 and 0.5 has been added to the numeric Hubble type to\nspread the points in the plots. The filled circles represent the latetype galaxies with high quality rotation curves from the sample presented in this paper. The open triangles represent galaxies from the Ursa Major sample (Verheijen 1997; Verheijen &\nSancisi 2001), filled triangles represent the galaxies from various\nsources presented in Broeils (1992a), open squares the galaxies\nfrom Spekkens & Giovanelli (2006). The stars represent galaxies\nwith H\u03b1 rotation curves from the samples of de Blok & Bosma\n(2002) and Swaters et al. (2003a). The long-dashed line represents the relation between Hubble and rotation curve shape as\nreported by Casertano & van Gorkom (1991), the short-dashed\nline the same relation as found by Broeils (1992a). The horizonh\ntal solid and dotted lines indicate the average value for S (2,L)\nand\nthe 1\u03c3 range for galaxies with Hubble type later than Sc (see text\nfor details).\n\nThe combined literature sample will be used as comparison in\nthe following discussion.\n6.2. Rotation curve shape and morphology\n\nThe relation between rotation curve shape and morphology is\nexplored in Fig.5. In this figure, the logarithmic slope between\nh\ntwo disk scale lengths and the last measured point, S (2,L)\n, is plotted against the numeric Hubble type. Only galaxies in which\nthe H i extends to beyond three disk scale lengths have been\nh\nplotted. For galaxies with less extended H i disks S (2,L)\nis not\nwell-determined because the rotation velocities lie on the rising branch. In Fig. 5, the filled circles represent the high-quality\nsample. Also shown in these figures are the logarithmic slopes\nfor the spiral galaxies in the samples of Verheijen & Sancisi\n(2001, open triangles), Broeils (1992a, filled triangles), and\nSpekkens & Giovanelli (2006, open squares). We have also plotted the logarithmic slopes for the galaxies with H\u03b1 rotation\ncurves, from the samples of dBB and SMvdBB (stars).\nh\nWe have chosen to use S (2,L)\nrather than the slope between\ntwo thirds of the optical radius R25 and the last measured point\n\n6.3. Rotation curve shape, amplitude, and absolute\nmagnitude\n\nTo investigate the relation between the rotation curve shape, amplitude, and absolute magnitude, we have plotted the rotation\ncurves grouped into six intervals in absolute magnitude in Fig. 6.\nIn this figure, the radii are expressed in units of disk scale length.\nThe full lines refer to galaxies in the high quality sample and the\ndotted lines to galaxies in the lower quality sample. The most\nobvious relation is the decrease in amplitude towards fainter absolute magnitudes, as expected from the Tully-Fisher relation.\nNote that there is a spread in rotation curve shapes in each luminosity bin. This spread may in part be observational in nature, e.g., as a result of inclination errors and asymmetries in\nthe galaxies. The top left panel contains late-type galaxies in the\ntransition regime between bright galaxies and dwarf galaxies.\nThe relations between absolute magnitude or maximum rotation velocity on the one hand, and rotation curve shape on the\nother, are made more explicit in Figs. 7 (top panel) and 8.\nAt first sight, the correlation seen between the rotation curve\nh\nshape S (2,L)\nand absolute magnitude (see Fig.7, top panel) seems\nto confirm the results found by e.g., Rubin et al. (1985), Persic\n& Salucci (1988), Broeils (1992a), and CvG that rotation curves\nrise more slowly towards lower luminosities. However, with the\naddition of the dwarf galaxies presented here, the dwarf regime\nis better sampled and extended down to fainter absolute magnitudes, thus making it possible to sample this correlation in more\ndetail at the low luminosity end.\nh\nIn Fig. 5 it was shown that the rotation curve shape S (2,L)\nis similar for galaxies with Hubble types later than Sc. A similar trend is seen with absolute magnitude, as can be seen in\nthe top panel of Fig. 7. This is not unexpected, given the tight\ncorrelation between Hubble type and absolute magnitude (bottom panel of Fig. 7). From Fig. 7 it is clear that, down to the\nfaintest magnitudes, all the galaxies in our sample with high\nquality rotation curves have logarithmic slopes between 0 and\n0.3, although the scatter may increase somewhat towards lower\nh\nabsolute magnitudes. For these galaxies, the mean value of S (2,L)\nis 0.17 \u00b1 0.08, where the uncertainty is the dispersion around the\nmean. The logarithmic slopes of late-type spiral galaxies with\n\u221220.5 < MR < \u221218 have similar values. For these galaxies,\nh\nis 0.15 \u00b1 0.11. Thus, the results in Fig. 7\nthe average S (2,L)\nindicate that the outer rotation curve shapes, as measured by\nh\n, are similar for late-type spiral galaxies and the late-type\nS (2,L)\ndwarf galaxies in our sample. Therefore, for galaxies fainter than\n\n\fR. A. Swaters et al.: The rotation curves shapes of late-type dwarf galaxies\n\n13\n\nFig. 6. Rotation curves in bins of absolute magnitude with radii expressed in units of disk scale length. The full lines give the\nrotation curves of the galaxies in the high quality sample, the dotted lines those of the galaxies in the lower quality sample.\nMR = \u221220, the outer rotation curve shape does not appear to\ndepend on luminosity down to MR \u223c \u221216 and possibly even\nMR \u223c \u221214, although we have little information at the lowest\nluminosities.\nAt the brighter end, as was already pointed out by CvG and\nBroeils (1992a), the most luminous galaxies tend to have declining rotation curves. This is also seen in Fig. 7. Galaxies brighter\nh\nthan about MR \u223c \u221221 mostly have negative values of S (2,L)\n, indicating lower rotation velocities at the last measured points.\nVirtually all of these galaxies have bulges, as is demonstrated\nh\nin the bottom panel of Fig. 7, where the S (2,L)\nis plotted against\nthe numerical Hubble type. A larger sample of early-type spiral\nand high-luminosity galaxies is needed to study the details of\nthe correlations between rotation curve shape and morphology\nor luminosity.\nh\nFollowing CvG, we have also plotted S (2,L)\nagainst the maximum rotation velocity in Fig. 8. The relation between these\nquantities found by CvG, represented by the dotted line, is given\nfor comparison. The galaxies in the sample presented here follow the same relation. This may seem to indicate that the results\npresented here are in good agreement with the relation found by\nCvG. However, at the lowest rotation velocities, the galaxies in\nthe comparison sample tend to fall above the CvG relation. In\nfact, 4 out 5 galaxies with 3max < 80 km s\u22121 fall well above\nthe dotted line. Similarly, the slowest rotators in Fig. 6 of CvG\nalso fall above their relation. Thus, even though the values for\nh\nS (2,L)\nfor the galaxies in our sample are consistent with the CvG\nh\nrelation, the S (2,L)\nvalues for our high-quality sample are significantly different from those for our reference sample. We point\nout, however, that there are only a small number of galaxies with\n3max < 80 km s\u22121 . To fully sample the relation between rotation\n\ncurve shape and 3max , a larger number of beam-smearing corrected rotation curves is needed. We also note that at the higher\nmass end the galaxies in our sample fall above the CvG relation. This was also noted by Broeils (1992a), who remarked that\nthere is a clear correlation between the slope and the maximum\nvelocity, but that it is not a simple linear relation.\nThe slope of the rotation curve is weakly correlated with surface brightness, as can be seen in Fig. 9. At intermediate surface\nbrightnesses, there is a large spread in slopes. At the high surface\nbrightness end, galaxies tend to have flat or declining rotation\ncurves, and at the low surface brightness end, galaxies tend to\nhave slowly rising rotation curves.\n6.4. Rotation curve shape and light distribution\n\nTo investigate a possible link between the light distribution and\nthe rotation curve, we compare the central concentration of light\nand the inner rotation curve shape. A straightforward measure of\nthe central concentration of light is given by the parameter \u2206\u03bcR ,\nwhich we defined as:\n\u2206\u03bcR = \u03bcR0 \u2212 \u03bcRc ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03bcRc is the observed central surface brightness. If a bulge or\na central concentration of light is present, \u2206\u03bcR is positive, and if\nthe light profile is flat-topped, \u2206\u03bcR is negative.\nA significant fraction of the late-type dwarf galaxies in our\nsample have non-exponential light profiles in the inner regions.\nSome have a central concentration of light, and in others the\nlight profile in the center falls below that of an exponential fit to\nthe outer parts of the light profile, making the light profile flattopped.

Logarithmic slope of the rotation curve between 2 disk\nh\nscale lengths and the last measured point S (2,L)\nversus the maximum rotation velocity. Only galaxies for which the last measured point lies beyond 3 disk scale lengths and with inclinations between 39\u25e6 and 80\u25e6 have been plotted. Symbol coding\nas in Fig. 5. The dotted line represents the correlation between\nrotation curve shape and maximum rotation velocity found by\nCasertano & van Gorkom (1991).\n\nFig. 7. Logarithmic slope of the rotation curve between 2 disk\nh\nscale lengths and the last measured point S (2,L)\nversus the the\nabsolute R-band magnitude MR (top), and numeric Hubble type\nversus MR (bottom). Only galaxies for which the last measured\npoint lies beyond 3 disk scale lengths and with inclinations between 39\u25e6 and 80\u25e6 have been plotted. A random value between\n-0.5 and 0.5 has been added to the numeric Hubble type to spread\nthe points in the plots. Symbol coding as in Fig. 5.\n\nSancisi (2001) and Broeils (1992a) include both galaxies with\nstrong bulges and galaxies that are dominated by exponential\nprofiles. The galaxies in the sample of Spekkens & Giovanelli\n(2006) all have bulges or central concentrations of light.\nh\nIn Fig. 10, \u2206\u03bcR is plotted against S (1,2)\n, the logarithmic slope\nbetween one and two disk scale lengths, for the late-type dwarf\ngalaxies in our sample and for the galaxies in the comparison\nh\nsamples. A clear correlation is found between \u2206\u03bcR and S (1,2)\n.\nRotation curves of galaxies with a central concentration of light\nare relatively flat between one and two disk scale lengths, and\ntherefore they must rise steeply within one disk scale length.\nGalaxies with a flat-topped light profile have rotation curves that\nrise more slowly in the inner parts. This correlation between \u2206\u03bcR\nh\nand S (1,2)\nremains even if only LSB galaxies with \u03bcR > 22 mag\narcsec\u22122 are considered, although the range in \u2206\u03bcR is reduced to\n\u22121 < \u2206\u03bcR < 1 for those galaxies. As can be seen in Fig. 10,\nh\nthe correlation between \u2206\u03bcR and S (1,2)\nshows considerable scatter. It is likely this is partly due to observational uncertainties,\ngiven that for two thirds of the galaxies the resolution of the H i\nobservations is similar to the scale lengths of these galaxies.\n\nFig. 9.

Discussion and conclusions\nIn this paper, we have presented rotation curves derived from H i\nobservations for a sample of 62 galaxies. These rotation curves\nhave been derived by interactively fitting model data cubes to the\nobserved cubes. This procedure takes the rotation curve shape,\nthe H i distribution, the inclination, and the size of the beam into\naccount, and makes it possible to correct for the effects of beam\nsmearing. Comparison of the derived rotation curves with high\nresolution H\u03b1 rotation curves shows good general agreement,\n\n\fR. A. Swaters et al.: The rotation curves shapes of late-type dwarf galaxies\n\nFig. 10. Logarithmic slope of the rotation curve between 1 and\nh\n2 disk scale lengths S (1,2)\nversus the difference between extrapolated disk surface brightness \u03bcR0 and the observed central surface\nbrightness \u03bcRc . Only galaxies with inclinations between 39\u25e6 and\n80\u25e6 have been plotted. Symbol coding as in Fig. 5.\n\nindicating that the scheme used to correct the rotation curves for\nbeam smearing works well.\nFrom our sample of 62 galaxies, we selected 18 systems with\nrotation curves of high quality. These have been used to study the\nshapes and amplitudes of the rotation curves and their relation\nwith the distribution of light.\nWe have found that the rotation curve shapes of late-type\ndwarf galaxies in our sample are similar to those of higher luminosity, late-type spiral galaxies, in the sense that for most of\nthe dwarf galaxies in our sample the rotation curves, when expressed in units of disk scale lengths, rise as steeply in the inner\nparts and start to flatten beyond about two disk scale lengths.\nMoreover, there are several galaxies with relatively flat rotation\ncurves, and with amplitudes as low as 60 km s\u22121 .\nWe found no galaxies with pure solid body rotation curves\nthat extend beyond 3 disk scale lengths. Thus, whether the rotation curve becomes flat to depends mainly on the extent of the\nrotation curve, independent of its amplitude.\nThis similarity between the rotation curve shapes of late-type\ndwarf and late-type spiral galaxies is also borne out by the similar logarithmic slopes between two disk scale lengths and the\nlast measured point. For the late-type dwarf galaxies in our highh\n= 0.17 \u00b1 0.08, and for the spiral galaxquality sample, S (2,L)\nh\nies in our reference sample S (2,L)\n= 0.15 \u00b1 0.11. The similarity\nbetween the rotation curve shapes of dwarf and spiral galaxies\ncontinues down to MR \u223c \u221216 mag, and possibly even down\nto MR \u223c \u221214 mag, although we have little information at the\nfaintest luminosities. The ongoing FIGGS survey (e.g., Begum\net al. 2008) will likely fill this gap.\nThe results presented here confirm earlier findings by CvG\nand Broeils (1992) that the rotation curve shape depends on morphology and luminosity (at least for galaxies brighter than approximately MR = \u221219 mag). However, with the inclusion of the\ngalaxies from the sample presented here, and a larger number of\nspiral galaxies from the sample of Verheijen & Sancisi (2001),\nthe correlation between rotation curve shape and morphology\nand luminosity is better defined, especially at the low luminosity end. Based on these new data, we find that the outer rotation\n\n15\n\ncurves of galaxies with Hubble types later than Sc or with absolute magnitudes fainter than approximately MR = \u221219 mag\nall have similar shapes. In other words, we find that the outer\nrotation curve shape does not depend on luminosity or morphology for galaxies fainter than MR \u223c \u221219 for the sample presented\nhere.\nThe main reason for this difference in the reported correlation between rotation curve shape on the one hand and Hubble\ntype or absolute magnitude on the other lies in the derived rotation curve shapes for the late-type dwarf galaxies presented\nhere compared to those derived from rotation curves as published in the literature. Both beam smearing (see Section 3 and\nreferences therein) and intensity-weighted velocities (see Paper I\nand references therein) will lead to a shallower derived rotation\ncurves, especially where the rotation curve is rising or turning\nover. These differences may well explain the differences in derived rotation curves.\nConsidering the bright galaxies that have outer rotationcurve slopes different from those of late-type dwarf galaxies, it\nis interesting to note that the vast majority of these have a bulge\n(or a strong central concentration of light). These bulges have a\nstrong effect on the shape of the inner rotation shape, causing a\nsteep rise in the center. But the effect of these bulges may extend to larger radii as well and explain the falling rotation curves\nseen in some galaxies (e.g. Noordermeer et al. 2007). Given that\nwe found that the outer rotation curve shapes for galaxies fainter\nthan MR \u223c \u221219 (which overwhelmingly do not have bulges) do\nnot depend on luminosity, it is tempting to speculate that the\nchange in rotation curve shapes for brighter galaxies is the result\nfrom the increasing contribution of the bulge, while the rotation\ncurve shape of the underlying disk remains unchanged.\nWe have found a relation between the shape of the central\ndistribution of light and the inner rise of the rotation curve.\nGalaxies with a stronger central concentration of light have a\nmore steeply rising rotation curve. This correlation between the\nlight distribution and the inner rise of the rotation curve is well\nknown for spiral galaxies (e.g., Kent 1987, Corradi & Capaccioli\n1990), but in this paper we have found that dwarf galaxies with\na central concentration of light also have rotation curves that\nrise more steeply in the center than the rotation curves of dwarf\ngalaxies that do not have a central concentration of light.\nThe observed correlation between the light distribution and\nthe inner rotation curve shape, as seen in both spiral and late-type\ndwarf galaxies, implies that galaxies with stronger central concentrations of light also have higher central mass densities, and\nit suggests that the luminous mass dominates the gravitational\npotential in the central regions, even in low surface brightness\ndwarf galaxies.\nAcknowledgements.

For each galaxy a figure is given\nwith two panels. In the left panel, the position-velocity diagram\nalong the major axis is shown. Contour levels are at \u22124\u03c3 and\n\u22122\u03c3 (dotted), and 2\u03c3, 4\u03c3, ... . Overlayed on the position-velocity\ndiagram is the rotation curve. If the rotation curve has been derived for the approaching and the receding side separately, then\nthese are shown. In the right panel, the derived rotation curve\n(represented by the thick solid line and the filled circles) is\nshown. If the rotation curves for the approaching and receding\nsides were derived separately, both are shown, together with the\naverage. The thin solid line represents the the approaching side,\nthe dotted line the receding side. The arrow at the bottom of the\npanel indicates a radius of 2 optical disk scale lengths.\n\n\fR. A.
