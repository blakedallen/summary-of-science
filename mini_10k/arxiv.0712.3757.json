The cross-correlation\nfunction between these two sequences at shift \u03c4 , where 0 \u2264 \u03c4 < p, is defined by\nC(\u03c4 ) =\n\np\u22121\nX\n\n(\u22121)at +bt+\u03c4 .\n\nt=0\n\nA well studied problem is to find the cross-correlation function between two\nbinary m-sequences {st } and {sdt } of the same length 2m \u2212 1 that differ by a\ndecimation d such that gcd(d, 2m \u2212 1) = 1. An overview of known results can be\nfound in Helleseth [1], Helleseth and Kumar [2] and Dobbertin et. al. [3].\nRecently, Ness and Helleseth [4] studied the cross correlation between any msequence {st } of length p = 2m \u2212 1 and any m-sequences {udt } of shorter length\n2m/2 \u2212 1, where m is even and gcd(d, 2m/2 \u2212 1) = 1. For convenience, {ut } is selected to be the m-sequence used in the small Kasami sequence family. The only\nknown families of m-sequences of these periods giving a two-valued cross correlation are related to the Kasami sequences [5] and are obtained taking d = 1.\nFurther, families with three-valued cross correlation have been constructed by\nNess and Helleseth in [4] and [6]. These results were generalized by Helleseth,\nKholosha and Ness [7] who covered all known cases of three-valued cross correlation and conjectured that these were the only existing.\nIn this paper, we consider pairs of sequences with a four-valued cross correlation. The first family with such a property was described in [8]. We completed a\nfull search for all values of m \u2264 32 and revealed a few examples that did not fit\ninto the known family. Most of the cases with four-valued cross correlation occur\nfor m = 2nk with n > 2 odd and the decimation\nd=\n\n2nk + 1\n2k + 1\n\nwith k > 1 .\n\nThe main result of this paper is finding the distribution for this four-valued cross\ncorrelation. Note that the family found in [8] corresponds to the latter decimation\nwhen setting n = 3.\n1\n\n\fIn Section 2, we present preliminaries needed to prove our main results. In\nSection 3, we give the distribution of the number of zeros of a particular affine\npolynomial Aa (x). Section 4 provides the distribution of the number of zeros\nof a special linearized polynomial La (z). The zeros of these two polynomials\nare useful when obtaining the cross-correlation values. Section 5 determines the\ncross-correlation distribution of our four-valued family.\n\n2\n\nPreliminaries\n\nLet GF(q) denote a finite field with q elements and let GF(q)\u2217 = GF(q) \\ {0}.\nThe finite field GF(q l ) is a subfield of GF(q m ) if and only if l divides m. The\ntrace mapping from GF(q m ) to the subfield GF(q l ) is defined by\nm/l\u22121\n\nTrm\nl (x)\n\nX\n\n=\n\nxq\n\nli\n\n.\n\ni=0\n\nIn the case when l = 1, we use the notation Trm (x) instead of Trm\n1 (x). The norm\nm\nm\nl\nNl (x) of x \u2208 GF(q ) over the subfield GF(q ) is defined by\nm/l\u22121\n\nNm\nl (x)\n\nY\n\n=\n\nxq\n\nli\n\n.\n\ni=0\n\nLet m be even and \u03b1 be an element of order p = 2m \u2212 1 in GF(2m ). Then\nthe m-sequence {st } of length p = 2m \u2212 1 can be written in terms of the trace\nmapping as\nst = Trm (\u03b1t ) .\nm/2\n\nLet \u03b2 = \u03b12 +1 be an element of order 2m/2 \u2212 1. The sequence {ut } of length\n2m/2 \u2212 1 (which is used in the construction of the well known Kasami family) is\ndefined by\nut = Trm/2 (\u03b2 t ) .\nIn this paper, we consider the cross correlation between the m-sequences {st }\nand {vt } = {udt } at shift \u03c4 defined by\nCd (\u03c4 ) =\n\np\u22121\nX\n\n(\u22121)st +vt+\u03c4 ,\n\n(1)\n\nt=0\n\nwhere gcd(d, 2m/2 \u2212 1) = 1 and \u03c4 = 0, 1, . . . , 2m/2 \u2212 2. Using the trace representation, Ness and Helleseth [4] showed that the set of values of Cd (\u03c4 ) + 1 for\n\u03c4 = 0, 1, . . . , 2m/2 \u2212 2 is equal to the set of values of\nX\nd(2m/2 +1) )\nS(a) =\n(\u22121)Trm (ax)+Trm/2 (x\n(2)\nx\u2208GF(2m )\n\n2\n\n\fwhen a \u2208 GF(2m/2 )\u2217 .\nThe main result of this paper is formulated in the following corollary that\ngives a four-valued cross-correlation function between new pairs of m-sequences\nof different lengths.\nnk\n\n+1\nCorollary 1 Let m = 2nk and d = 22k +1\n, where n > 2 is odd and k > 1. Then\nthe cross-correlation function Cd (\u03c4 ) has the following distribution:\n\n\u22121 \u2212 2(n+1)k\n\u22121 \u2212 2nk\n\u22121\n\u22121 + 2nk\n\n(n\u22121)k\n\noccurs 2 22k \u22121\u22121\nnk\nk\u22121 \u22121)\noccurs (2 \u22121)(2\n2k \u22121\noccurs 2(n\u22121)k \u2212 1\nnk\nk\u22121\noccurs (2 2+1)2\nk +1\n\ntimes\ntimes\ntimes\ntimes\n\n,\n,\n,\n.\n\nThe result will be proved in a series of lemmas and propositions. The outline\nof the proof is as follows. Determining the set of values of Cd (\u03c4 ) + 1 for \u03c4 =\n0, 1, . . . , 2nk \u2212 2 is equivalent to finding the set of values of S(a) in (2) for a \u2208\nGF(2nk )\u2217 . Furthermore, we show that\n2k\n\n1 X\nSi (a) ,\nS(a) = k\n2 + 1 i=0\nwhere Si (a) are defined by\nSj (a) =\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)Trm (r\n\nj ay 2k +1 )+Tr\n\nnk (y\n\n2nk +1 )\n\nand\n\ny\u2208GF(2m )\n\nS2k +1\u2212j (a) =\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)Trm (r\n\n\u2212j ay 2k +1 )+Tr\n\nnk (y\n\n2nk +1 )\n\ny\u2208GF(2m )\nnk\n\nk\u22121\n\nfor j = 0, 1, . . . , 2k\u22121 and with r = \u03b1(2 \u22121)2 .\nWe determine S0 (a) exactly in Corollary 4 and find Si (a)2 in Lemma 4. Since\nS(a) is an integer, we can resolve the sign ambiguity of all Si (a) for i = 1, 2, . . . , 2k .\nIn order to determine S0 (a), we need to consider zeros in GF(2nk ) of the affine\npolynomial\nk\n2k\nk\nAa (x) = a2 x2 + x2 + ax + c ,\nwhere c \u2208 GF(2k ) and Trk (c) = 1. To determine Si (a)2 for 1 = 1, 2, . . . , 2k , we\nneed to consider zeros in GF(22nk ) of the linearized polynomial\n(n+1)k\n\nLa (z) = z 2\n\nk\n\nk\n\n2k\n\n+ r 2 a2 z 2 + raz ,\nnk\n\n2nk +1\n\nwhere n is odd, a \u2208 GF(2nk ) and r \u2208 GF(22nk )\u2217 with r 2 +1 = 1 but r 2k +1 6= 1.\nWhen finding the complete cross-correlation distribution, we make use of the\nfollowing lemma from [4].\n3\n\n\fLemma 1 ([4]) For any decimation d with gcd(d, 2nk \u2212 1) = 1 the sum of the\ncross-correlation values defined in (1) for m = 2nk is equal to\nnk \u22122\n2X\n\nCd (\u03c4 ) = 1 .\n\n\u03c4 =0\n\n3\n\nThe Affine Polynomial Aa (x)\n\nIn this section, we consider zeros in GF(2nk ), with n > 2, of the affine polynomial\nk\n\n2k\n\nk\n\nAa (x) = a2 x2 + x2 + ax + c ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere a \u2208 GF(2nk ) and c \u2208 GF(2k ). Some additional conditions on the parameters will be imposed later. The distribution of zeros in GF(2nk ) of (3) will\ndetermine to a large extent the distribution of our cross-correlation function. It\nis clear that Aa (x) does not have multiple roots if a 6= 0.\nWe introduce a particular sequence of polynomials over GF(2nk ) that will\nplay a crucial role when finding zeros of (3). First, for any v \u2208 GF(2nk ) denote\nik\nvi = v 2 for i = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1 so Aa (x) = a1 x2 + x1 + a0 x0 + c. Let\nB1 (x) = 1 ,\nB2 (x) = 1 ,\nBi+2 (x) = Bi+1 (x) + xi Bi (x) for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1 .\n\n(4)\n\nObserve the following recursive identity that can be seen as an equivalent\ndefinition of Bi (x)\nk\n\n2k\n\n2\nBi+2 (x) = Bi+1\n(x) + x1 Bi2 (x) for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1 .\n\n(5)\n\nWe prove it using induction on i. For i = 1 and i = 2 this fact is easily checked\ntaking the definition.

Moreover, polynomial\nBn (x) splits in GF(2nk ), all its zeros have the form of (7) with Trnk\nk (v0 ) = 0 and\nk\noccur with multiplicity 2 .\nProof. First, note that v \u2208 GF(2nk ) \\ GF(2k ) if and only if v0 6= v1 which\nguarantees that the denominator in (7) and in the above identity for Bn (V ) is\nnot zero.

We start with proving that cBn (a)/Zn (a) indeed is a zero of Aa (x) if\nZn (a) 6= 0.

Therefore,\n\u0011\nc \u0010\n2k\nk\na1 Bn2 (a) + Bn2 (a) + a0 Bn (a) + Zn (a)\n(12)\nAa (Va ) =\nZn (a)\n\u0011\nc \u0010\nk\n(4)\n22k\n22k\na1 Bn\u22121\n(a) + a1 a0 Bn\u22122\n(a) + Bn2 (a) + a0 Bn (a) + Zn (a)\n=\nZn (a)\n\u0011\nc \u0010\n(5)\n2k\n=\nBn+1 (a) + a0 Bn\u22121\n(a) + Zn (a) = 0 .\nZn (a)\n\nNow we show that in our case Va is the only zero of Aa (x). Taking equation\nAa (x) = 0 and all its 2ik powers we obtain n equations\nik\n\nA2a (x) = ai+1 xi+2 + xi+1 + ai xi + c = 0 for i = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1 ,\nwhere all indices are calculated modulo n. If xi (i = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1) are considered\nas independent variables then the obtained system of n linear equations with n\nunknowns has the following matrix with the antidiagonal structure\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0\n0\n* * * a1 1\na0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n.\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0\n..\n1\na\n0\n1\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\uf8ec .\n.. \uf8f7\n..\n.. .. ..\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec .\n(13)\n\uf8f7 .\n\uf8ec\n.\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec a\n.\n.\n1\n0\nn\u22122\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n.\n.\n\uf8ed 1\n.\nan\u22122\n0 an\u22121 \uf8f8\nan\u22121\n0\n* * * 0 a0\n1\nLet the columns of (13) be numbered from 1 to n. Permuting the columns in (13)\n(reorder them as n \u2212 1, n \u2212 2, . . . , 1, n) we obtain the symmetric three-diagonal\ncyclic matrix Mn containing ones on the main diagonal, with Mn (i, i + 1) =\nMn (i + 1, i) = ai for i = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1 and with corner elements Mn (1, n) =\nMn (n, 1) = a0 . If x = (x1 , . . . , xn\u22121 , x0 )T and c = (c, . . . , c)T then the system\nhas the following matrix representation\nMn x = c .\n\n(14)\n\nThe determinant of (13) is equal to the determinant of Mn and can be computed\nexpanding the latter by minors along the last row. Doing this it is easy to see\nthat\ndet Mn\n\n=\n(10,11)\n\n=\n(4)\n=\n(6)\n=\n\n\u2206a (1, n \u2212 2) + an\u22121 (an\u22121 \u2206a (1, n \u2212 3) + a0 . . . an\u22122 )\n+ a0 (a0 \u2206a (2, n \u2212 2) + a1 . . . an\u22121 )\nk\n\n2\n2\nBn2 (a) + a2n\u22121 Bn\u22121\n(a) + (a0 Bn\u22121\n(a))2\nk\n\n2\n2\nBn+1\n(a) + (a0 Bn\u22121\n(a))2\n\nZn2 (a) .\n9\n\n\fThus, if Zn (a) 6= 0 then (14) has exactly one solution. Now note that every\nik\nv \u2208 GF(2nk ) with Aa (v) = 0 provides a solution to the system given by vi = v 2\nfor i = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1. Therefore, if Zn (a) 6= 0 then Aa (x) has at most one zero.\nUsing Corollary 2, we can obtain the number of a \u2208 GF(2nk )\u2217 such that\nZn (a) 6= 0 (note that Zn (0) = 1). Observe that this number is identical to N0 from\nTheorem 1 that is equal to the number of a \u2208 GF(2nk )\u2217 such that la (x) = 0 has\nexactly one root in GF(2nk ) (see explanations following Theorem 1). Therefore,\nif Aa (x) has exactly one zero in GF(2nk ) then its homogeneous part la (x) has the\nsame number of zeros and so a is necessarily such that Zn (a) 6= 0.\nFinally, to prove the trace identity for Va first note that for any v \u2208 GF(2nk )\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(6)\nnk\n2k\nB\n(v)\n+\nB\n(v)\n+\nv\nB\nTrnk\n(B\n(v)\n+\nZ\n(v))\n=\nTr\n(v)\n(15)\nn\nn+1\n0 n\u22121\nn\nn\nk\nk\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(4)\n2k\nB\n(v)\n+\nB\n(v)\n+\nv\nB\n(v)\n+\nv\nB\n= Trnk\n(v)\nn\nn\nn\u22121 n\u22121\n0 n\u22121\nk\n\u0011\n\u0010\nk\n= Trnk\nvn\u22121 Bn\u22121 (v) + (vn\u22121 Bn\u22121 (v))2 = 0 .\nk\nTherefore, since c and Zn (v) are both in GF(2k ), then\n\u0013\n\u0012\nBn (v) + Zn (v)\nTrnk (Vv ) = Trnk c + c\nZ (v)\n\u0013\n\u0012 n\nc\nnk\nTr (Bn (v) + Zn (v))\n= Trk (nc) + Trk\nZn (v) k\n= Trk (nc) .\n\nThis completes the proof.\n\n\u0003\n\nProposition 2 Let n be odd and take any a \u2208 GF(2nk )\u2217 . Then polynomial Aa (x)\nhas exactly 2k zeros in GF(2nk ) if and only if Zn (a) = 0 and Bn (a) 6= 0. Moreover,\nthese zeros are the following\nn\u22121\n\nv\u03bc = c\n\n2\nX\n\n(2i+1)k\n\n2\nBn\u22121\n\n(a)\n\nBn2(2i+1)k +22ik \u22121 (a)\ni=0\n\n+ \u03bcBn (a)\n\nwith \u03bc \u2208 GF(2k ) and for each zero of this type Trnk (v\u03bc ) = 0. Also |M2k | =\n2(n\u22121)k \u2212 1.\n2k\n\nk\n\nProof. First, we consider la (x) = a1 x2 + x2 + a0 x being the linearized\nhomogeneous part of Aa (x), and prove that it has exactly 2k zeros in GF(2nk ) if\nand only if Zn (a) = 0 and Bn (a) 6= 0.\nAssume that Zn (a) = 0 and Bn (a) 6= 0. Then, by (12),\n2k\n\nk\n\na1 Bn2 (a) + Bn2 (a) + a0 Bn (a) = 0\n10\n\n(16)\n\n\fwhich means that all 2k distinct values \u03bcBn (a) for \u03bc \u2208 GF(2k ) are zeros of la (x).\nIt is not difficult to see that in our case la (x) can not have more than 2k zeros in\nGF(2nk ). Indeed, consider matrix Mn of the system of n linear equations (14)\nwith c = 0. Note that det Mn = Zn2 (a) = 0 and a principal submatrix obtained\nby deleting the last column and the last row from Mn is nonsingular with the\ndeterminant \u2206a (1, n \u2212 2) = Bn2 (a) 6= 0 (see (10)). Therefore, applying equivalent\nrow transformations to Mn we can obtain a matrix containing a nonsingular\ndiagonal submatrix lying in the first n \u2212 1 columns and rows. Thus, the equation\ngiven by the first row of this equivalent matrix is nonzero and has degree 2k . We\nconclude that homogeneous system (14) can not have more than 2k solutions and\nthe same holds for the equation la (x) = 0.\nNow we prove the converse implication. Assume that la (x) has exactly 2k\nzeros in GF(2nk ). Here we use the technique found by Bluher [10] for counting\nk\nthe number of b \u2208 GF(2nk )\u2217 for which fb (y) = y 2 +1 + by + b has exactly one\nzero in GF(2nk ). Denote S = {x \u2208 GF(2nk ) \\ GF(2k ) | Trnk\nk (x) 6= 0}. For any\nk\n\nv \u2208 S define r = v 1\u22122 + 1 \u2208 GF(2nk ) \\ {0, 1} and corresponding b =\nObviously, such an r is a zero of fb (y). Note that\nk\n\nk\n\nk +1\n\n(v + v 2 )2\nr 2 +1\nk\nk\nk\n= v 2 \u22121 (v 1\u22122 + 1)2 +1 =\nb=\nr+1\nv 22k +1\n\n= V \u22121 ,\n\nk\n\nr 2 +1\nr+1\n\n6= 0.\n\n(17)\n\nwhere V comes from (7). Then, by Lemma 2 and Corollary 2, Bn (b\u22121 ) 6= 0 and\nZn (b\u22121 ) = 0. By the implication already proved, lb\u22121 (x) has exactly 2k zeros\nin GF(2nk ). Multiplying the latter polynomial by b0 b1 x\u22121 (we remove one zero\nk\n2k\nk\nx = 0) and then substituting x with b0 y leads to b21 y 2 \u22121 + b21 y 2 \u22121 + b1 with\n2k \u2212 1 zeros and having the form of polynomial g(x) from Theorem 1. Thus, by\n(ii) in this theorem, fb (y) (as well as fb2l+1 (y)) has exactly one zero in GF(2nk ).\nNow we prove that function (17) that maps every v \u2208 S to b \u2208 GF(2nk )\u2217 is a\n(2k \u2212 1)-to-1 mapping. First, note that (2k \u2212 1)-power is a (2k \u2212 1)-to-1 mapping\nk\nof S to GF(2nk )\u2217 . Indeed, if x \u2208 S and x2 \u22121 = t then the latter identity holds\nnk\nfor all distinct \u03b4x \u2208 S with \u03b4 \u2208 GF(2k )\u2217 since Trnk\nk (\u03b4x) = \u03b4Trk (x) 6= 0 and\nk\n\u03b4x \u2208\n/ GF(2k ). Thus, every r = v 1\u22122 + 1 is obtained from 2k \u2212 1 different values of\nv. Finally, the mapping from r to b is 1-to-1 since for the obtained b the equation\nfb (y) = 0 has exactly one root r.\nTherefore, taking all v \u2208 S and using (17), we obtain |S|/(2k \u2212 1) different\nvalues of b \u2208 GF(2nk )\u2217 and this number is equal to the total number of b such\nthat fb (y) has exactly one zero (see Theorem 1). Therefore, these and only these\nvalues of b satisfying (17) result in the polynomials fb (y) having exactly one zero.\nDividing la (x) by a0 a1 x (we remove one zero x = 0) and then substituting x\n\u22122k 22k \u22121\n2k \u22121\nwith a\u22121\n+ a\u22122\n+ a\u22121\n0 y leads to a1 y\n1 y\n1 which has the form of polynomial\n\u22121\ng(x) from Theorem 1 taking b = a1 . Thus, fa\u22121 (y) (as well as fa\u22122l+1 (y)) has\n11\n\n\fexactly one zero in GF(2nk ) and a\u22121 is obtained by (17). Therefore, by Lemma 2\nand Corollary 2, Bn (a) 6= 0 and Zn (a) = 0.\nIf Aa (x) has exactly 2k zeros in GF(2nk ) then the same holds for its homogeneous part la (x) and we already proved that in this case, Zn (a) = 0 and\nBn (a) 6= 0.

In the following proposition, the \"only if\" part follows from Propositions 1 and 2. We provide this proof yet, independently of previous statements,\nsince its major part contains the result used for proving the converse implication\nand also needed for proving the fact from Lemma 2.\n2k\n\nk\n\nProposition 3 Take any a \u2208 GF(2nk )\u2217 . Then polynomial la (x) = a1 x2 + x2 +\na0 x has exactly 22k zeros in GF(2nk ) if and only if Bn (a) = 0.\nProof. Assume that la (x) has exactly 22k zeros in GF(2nk ). Here we use the\ntechnique found by Bluher [10] for counting the number of b \u2208 GF(2nk )\u2217 for which\nk\nfb (y) = y 2 +1 +by +b has 2k +1 zeros in GF(2nk ). Denote G = GF(2nk )\\GF(22k ).\n2k\nTake any u \u2208 GF(2nk ) such that u \u2208\n/ GF(22k ) which implies u2 6= u and\nk\nk\nk\nk\n(u + u2 )2 6= u + u2 or, equivalently, u + u2 \u2208\n/ GF(2k ). Now we can define r =\nk\n\n2k +1\n\nk\n\n(u + u2 )1\u22122 + 1 \u2208 GF(2nk ) \\ {0, 1} and corresponding b = rr+1 6= 0. Obviously,\nk\nk\nsuch an r is a zero of fb (y). Define also r0 = ru2 \u22121 and r1 = r(u + 1)2 \u22121 and\nnote that r, r0 and r1 are pairwise distinct. Further,\nk +1\n\nfb (r0 ) = r 2\nk\n\n2k \u22121\n\nu2\n\nk\n\nk \u22121\n\n+ bru2\n2k\n\nsince r(u + u2 )2 = u + u2\n2k\n\n2k\n\nk\n\n+ b = b((r + 1)u2 + ru2 + u)/u = 0\n\nby the definition of r. Also, similarly, we get\nk\n\nfb (r1 ) = b((r+1)(u+1)2 +r(u+1)2 +(u+1))/(u+1) = b(r+1+r+1)/(u+1) = 0 .\n13\n\n\fThus, fb (y) with such a b has at least three zeros and, by Theorem 1, it has 2k + 1\nzeros. Note that\n2k\n\nk\n\nk\n\n(u + u2 )2 +1\nr 2 +1\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\n= (u + u2 )2 \u22121 ((u + u2 )1\u22122 + 1)2 +1 =\n= V \u22121 , (18)\nb=\nr+1\n(u + u2k )22k +1\nk\n\nwhere V comes from (7) assuming v = u + u2 .\nNow we prove that function (18) that maps every u \u2208 G to b \u2208 GF(2nk )\u2217\nk\nis a (23k \u2212 2k )-to-1 mapping. First, note that u + u2 is a 2k -to-1 mapping\nk\nonto F = {x \u2208 GF(2nk ) \\ GF(2k ) | Trnk\nk (x) = 0}. Further, (2 \u2212 1)-power is\nk\na (2k \u2212 1)-to-1 mapping of F to GF(2nk )\u2217 . Indeed, if x \u2208 F and x2 \u22121 = t\nthen the latter identity holds for all distinct \u03b4x \u2208 F with \u03b4 \u2208 GF(2k )\u2217 since\nk\nk\nnk\nTrnk\n/ GF(2k ). Thus, every r = (u + u2 )1\u22122 + 1\nk (\u03b4x) = \u03b4Trk (x) = 0 and \u03b4x \u2208\nis obtained from 2k (2k \u2212 1) different values of u. Finally, the mapping from r\nto b is (2k + 1)-to-1 since for the obtained b the equation fb (y) = 0 has (2k + 1)\nk\nroots and every root r satisfies (r + 1)\u22121 \u2208 F 2 \u22121 . Indeed, let r, r0 and r1 be\nany distinct zeros of fb (y) (not necessarily the ones defined above) and define\nu = (r + r1 )/(r0 + r1 ). Note that\nk\n\nk +1\n\nrr0 (r + r0 )2 = r0 r 2\n\nk \u22121\n\nand so b = rr0 (r + r0 )2\n\n2k \u22121\n\nu2\n\nk +1\n\n+ rr02\n\n= r0 b(r + 1) + rb(r0 + 1) = b(r + r0 )\nk \u22121\n\n= rr1 (r + r1 )2\nk +1\n\n= (r0 /r)2\n\nk \u22121\n\n= r0 r1 (r0 + r1 )2\n\n. Then\n\n= (r0 + 1)/(r + 1) 6= 1\nk\n\nk\n\nk\n\nand thus, u \u2208 G. The identity (r + 1)\u22121 = (u + u2 )2 \u22121 \u2208 F 2 \u22121 follows from\n[10, Lemma 2.1].\nTherefore, taking all u \u2208 G and using (18), we obtain |G|/(23k \u2212 2k ) different\nvalues of b \u2208 GF(2nk )\u2217 and this number is equal to the total number of b such\nthat fb (y) has 2k + 1 zeros (see Theorem 1). Therefore, these and only these\nvalues of b satisfying (18) result in the polynomials fb (y) having 2k + 1 zeros.\nDividing la (x) by a0 a1 x (we remove one zero x = 0) and then substituting x\n\u22122k 22k \u22121\n2k \u22121\nwith a\u22121\n+ a\u22122\n+ a\u22121\n0 y leads to a1 y\n1 y\n1 which has the form of polynomial\n\u22121\ng(x) from Theorem 1 taking b = a1 . Thus, fa\u22121 (y) (as well as fa\u22122k+1 (y)) has\nexactly 2k + 1 zeros in GF(2nk ) and a\u22121 is obtained by (18). Therefore, by\nLemma 2, Bn (a) = 0 .\nThe converse implication is easy now. If Bn (a) = 0 then, by Lemma 2, a\nk\nhas the form of (7) with v = u + u2 for some u \u2208 G. Then the corresponding\nb = a\u22121 has the form of (18) and, by the fact proved above, the polynomial fb (y)\nhas 2k + 1 zeros which, by Theorem 1 (iii), is equivalent to la (x) having 22k zeros.\n\u0003\nIn the following proposition, we prove that Aa (x) = 0 always has a solution\nif n is odd and Trk (c) = 1 (which is also valid for even n but this case is not\nrelevant to the current paper).\n14\n\n\fProposition 4 Take any a \u2208 GF(2nk ), where n is odd and c \u2208 GF(2k ) with\nTrk (c) = 1.

Since |M1 | + |M2k | + |M22k | = |GF(2nk )\u2217 |\nand A0 (x) has a unique zero x = c, polynomial Aa (x) has at least one zero in\nGF(2nk ) for any a \u2208 GF(2nk ).\n\u0003\n\n15\n\n\f4\n\nThe Linearized Polynomial La(z)\n\nThe distribution of the four-valued cross-correlation function to be determined in\nSection 5 depends on the detailed distribution of the number of zeros in GF(22nk ),\nwith n > 2, of the linearized polynomial\n(n+1)k\n\nLa (z) = z 2\n\nk\n\nk\n\n2k\n\n+ r 2 a2 z 2 + raz ,\n\n(19)\n2nk +1\n\nnk\n\nwhere n is odd, a \u2208 GF(2nk ) and r \u2208 GF(22nk )\u2217 with r 2 +1 = 1 but r 2k +1 6= 1.\nFor the details on linearized polynomials in general, the reader is referred to Lidl\nand Niederreiter [11]. It is clear that La (z) does not have multiple roots if a 6= 0.\nIn the following propositions, we always take La (z) defined in (19).\nDefine polynomials Yn (x) over GF(2nk ) as\n\u22121\nYn (x) = Zn2 (x) + Nnk\nk (x)(\u03b4 + \u03b4 ) ,\n2nk +1\n\nwhere \u03b4 = r 2k +1 \u2208 GF(22k ) is a (2k + 1)th root of unity over GF(2) and Zn (x)\nik\ncomes from (6). Also, for any v \u2208 GF(22nk ) denote vi = v 2 for i \u2265 0 so\nLa (z) = zn+1 + r1 a1 z2 + r0 a0 z0 . Finally, for 0 < j \u2264 i and x \u2208 GF(2nk ), let Dxj,i\ndenote a three-diagonal matrix of size i \u2212 j + 2 that contains ones on the main\ndiagonal and with\n(\u22121)j+t\u22121\n\nDxj,i (t, t + 1) = rj+t\n\nxj+t\n\n(\u22121)j+t\n\nand Dxj,i (t + 1, t) = rj+t\n\nxj+t\n\nfor t = 0, . . . , i \u2212 j, where the indices of r, x and powers of r are reduced modulo\n(\u22121)n\u22121\nn (the only exception is j + t = n when rn\n= r0\u22121 ), rows and columns of Dxj,i\nare numbered from 0 to i \u2212 j + 1. The determinant of Dxj,i , denoted as \u2206\u2032x (j, i),\ncan be computed expanding by minors along the last row to obtain\n\u2206\u2032x (j, i) = \u2206\u2032x (j, i \u2212 1) + x2i \u2206\u2032x (j, i \u2212 2)\nassuming \u2206\u2032x (j, i) = 1 if i\u2212j \u2208 {\u22122, \u22121}. Comparing the latter recursive identity\nwith (9) it is easy to see that\n\u2206\u2032x (j, i) = \u2206x (j, i) .\n\n(20)\n\nZeros of La (z) in GF(22nk ) form a vector space over GF(22k ). Since the degree\nof La (z) is 2(n+1)k , the number of zeros is at most 2(n+1)k , and thus, the dimension\nof the vector space over GF(22k ) is at most (n + 1)/2. Therefore, La (z) has either\n1, 22k , 24k , . . . , 2(n+1)k zeros in GF(22nk ). However, in Proposition 6 we prove that\nLa (z) can not have more than 22k zeros in GF(22nk ) and thus, the only possibilities\nare either 1 or 22k zeros.\n16\n\n\fProposition 5 For any a \u2208 GF(2nk )\u2217 , if Yn (a) 6= 0 then La (z) = 0 has exactly\none root in GF(22nk ) that is equal to zero. In particular, if Zn (a) = 0 (Zn (x)\ndefined in (6)) then La (z) has exactly one zero.\nProof. Obviously, La (0) = 0 and we have to show that this is the only zero\nof La (z) in GF(22nk ) if Yn (a) 6= 0. Taking equation La (z) = 0 and all its 22ik\npowers we obtain n equations\n2ik\n\nL2a (x) = zn+2i+1 + r2i+1 a2i+1 z2i+2 + r2i a2i z2i = 0 for i = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1 ,\nwhere all indices are calculated modulo 2n. If z2i (i = 0, . . . , n\u22121) are considered\nas independent variables then matrix Mn of the obtained system of n linear\nequations with n unknowns consists of three cyclic antidiagonals and\nMn (i, (n \u2212 3)/2 \u2212 i) = 1 ,\nMn (i, n \u2212 i \u2212 1) = r2i a2i ,\nMn (i, n \u2212 i \u2212 2) = r2i+1 a2i+1\n\nfor i = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1 ,\n\nwhere rows and columns of Mn (i, j) are numbered from 0 to n\u22121 and all elements\nof Mn are indexed modulo n.\nNow permute the columns and rows of Mn in the following way.

Take \u03b1 being a primitive element of GF(22nk ) and let ind(x) be\nnk\nk\u22121\ndefined as x = \u03b1ind(x) for any x \u2208 GF(22nk ). Letting also r = \u03b1(2 \u22121)2\nnk\nwe observe that r 2 +1 = 1 and that r i is not a (2k + 1)th power in GF(22nk )\nfor any i = 1, 2, . . . , 2k\u22121 since ind(r i ) \u2261 i (mod 2k + 1). It is also clear that\nind(r \u2212i ) \u2261 22nk \u2212 1 \u2212 ind(r i ) \u2261 2k + 1 \u2212 i (mod 2k + 1).\nFinding the distribution of the cross-correlation function Cd (\u03c4 ) + 1 is equivalent to computing the distribution of S(a) defined in (2) for a \u2208 GF(2k )\u2217 . To\ncalculate S(a), we first observe that gcd(2k + 1, 2m \u2212 1) = 2k + 1. If we first let\nk\nk\nk\nx = y 2 +1 then x = r i y 2 +1 and, finally, x = r \u2212i y 2 +1 for i = 1, . . . , 2k\u22121 and y\nrunning through GF(2m ) then x will run through GF(2m ) in total 2k + 1 times.\nFurther, since d(2k + 1)(2nk + 1) \u2261 2(2nk + 1) (mod 2m \u2212 1), we obtain\nk\n\n(2 + 1)S(a) =\n\nk\u22121\n2X\n\nX\n\ni\n\n(\u22121)Trm (r ay\n\n2k +1 )+Tr\n\nnk (y\n\n2nk +1 )\n\ni=0 y\u2208GF(2m )\n\n+\n\nk\u22121\n2X\n\nX\n\nk\n\n(\u22121)\n\nk +1\n\nTrm (r \u2212i ay 2\n\nnk +1\n\n)+Trnk (y 2\n\ni=1 y\u2208GF(2m )\n\n)\n\n=\n\n2\nX\n\nSi (a) ,\n\ni=0\n\nwhere Si (a) are defined as in Lemma 4. We divide the proof into three cases.\nCase 1: (Bn (a) = 0)\nIn this case, Corollary 4 gives S0 (a) = \u22122(n+2)k and, by Proposition 5, La (z)\nhas exactly one zero (since Zn (a) = 0 by (12)). Therefore, by Lemma 4 (ii),\nSi (a) = \u00b12nk for all values of i = 1, 2, . . . , 2k . Thus,\n(2k + 1)S(a) = \u22122(n+2)k + t2nk ,\nwhere |t| \u2264 2k . Reduce both sides of the latter identity modulo 2k + 1 to obtain\n1 \u2212 t \u2261 0 (mod 2k + 1). Since t is even then t 6= 1 and the only possibility is\nt = \u22122k leading to S(a) = \u22122(n+1)k .\nCase 2: (Zn (a) = 0 and Bn (a) 6= 0)\nIn this case, Corollary 4 gives S0 (a) = 2(n+1)k and, by Proposition 5, La (z)\nhas exactly one zero. Therefore, by Lemma 4 (ii), Si (a) = \u00b12nk for all values of\ni = 1, 2, . . . , 2k . Thus,\n(2k + 1)S(a) = 2(n+1)k + t2nk ,\nwhere |t| \u2264 2k . Reduce both sides of the latter identity modulo 2k + 1 to obtain\n1 \u2212 t \u2261 0 (mod 2k + 1). Since t is even then t 6= 1 and the only possibility is\nt = \u22122k leading to S(a) = 0.\nCase 3: (Zn (a) 6= 0)\nIn this case, Corollary 4 gives S0 (a) = \u22122nk . Consider a set of 2k\u22121 values\nj\n\u2212j\nk\u22121\nYn (a) = Zn2 (a) + Nnk\n,\nk (a)(\u03b4 + \u03b4 ) for j = 1, 2, . . . , 2\n\n24\n\n\f(22nk \u22121)2k\u22121\n2k +1\n\nis an element of multiplicative order 2k + 1. If quadratic\nwhere \u03b4 = \u03b1\nequation x + x\u22121 = Zn2 (a)/Nnk\nk (a) has two solutions then the product of these is\none and thus, there is at most one zero (say, when j = J ) in this set. Therefore, by Propositions 5, 7 and Lemma 4 (ii), Si (a) = \u00b12nk for all values of\ni = 1, 2, . . . , 2k except for, possibly, two with i = J and i = 2k + 1 \u2212 J when\nSJ (a) = S2k +1\u2212J (a) = \u00b12(n+1)k , using Lemma 4 (i).\nIn the case when Si (a) = \u00b12nk for all values of i = 1, 2, . . . , 2k , we have\n(2k + 1)S(a) = \u22122nk + t2nk ,\nwhere |t| \u2264 2k . Reduce both sides of the latter identity modulo 2k + 1 to obtain\n1 \u2212 t \u2261 0 (mod 2k + 1). Since t is even then t 6= 1 and the only possibility is\nt = \u22122k leading to S(a) = \u22122nk .\nFinally, in the case when Si (a) = \u00b12nk for all values of i = 1, 2, . . . , 2k except\nfor two, we have\n(2k + 1)S(a) = \u22122nk + t2nk + \u03b52(n+1)k+1 ,\nwhere |t| \u2264 2k \u2212 2 and \u03b5 \u2208 {\u22121, +1}. Reduce both sides of the latter identity\nmodulo 2k + 1 to obtain 1 \u2212 t + 2\u03b5 \u2261 0 (mod 2k + 1). Since t is even then\nt \u2208\n/ {\u22121, 3} and the only possibility is t = \u2212(2k \u2212 2) and \u03b5 = 1 leading to\nS(a) = 2nk .\nThe three cases above give, in total, the possible values 0, \u00b12nk and \u22122(n+1)k\nfor S(a). Suppose the cross-correlation function Cd (\u03c4 ) + 1 takes on the value zero\nr times, the value 2nk is taken on s times, the value \u22122nk occurs t times and the\nvalue \u22122(n+1)k occurs v times. Since S(a) = \u22122(n+1)k is possible only in Case 1,\n(n\u22121)k\nwhen Bn (a) = 0, then, by Lemma 2, v = 2 22k \u22121\u22121 . By Proposition 2, the number\nof a \u2208 GF(2nk )\u2217 such that Zn (a) = 0 and Bn (a) 6= 0 is equal 2(n\u22121)k \u2212 1. Thus,\nsince S(a) = 0 is possible only in Case 2, when Zn (a) = 0 and Bn (a) 6= 0, then\nr = 2(n\u22121)k \u2212 1.\nFor the remaining values of S(a) = \u00b12nk , obviously,\ns + t = 2nk \u2212 1 \u2212 (r + v) =\n\n2(n+2)k \u2212 2(n+1)k \u2212 2nk + 1\n.\n22k \u2212 1\n\nOn the other hand, from Lemma 1 it follows that\n2nk s \u2212 2nk t \u2212 2(n+1)k v = 2nk (s \u2212 t) \u2212\nand\ns\u2212t=1+\n\n2(n+1)k (2(n\u22121)k \u2212 1)\n= 2nk\n22k \u2212 1\n\n2k (2(n\u22121)k \u2212 1)\n2nk + 22k \u2212 2k \u2212 1\n=\n.\n22k \u2212 1\n22k \u2212 1\n25\n\n\fnk\n\nk\u22121\n\nnk\n\nk\u22121\n\n\u22121)\nThus, the solutions are s = (2 2+1)2\nand t = (2 \u22121)(2\n.\n\u0003\nk +1\n2k \u22121\nThe arguments in this paper also work for k = 1. However, in this case, the\ncorresponding decimation d = (2n + 1)/3 is only three-valued (see [4]). Indeed,\nin this case,\n\n3S(a) = S0 (a) + S1 (a) + S2 (a) = S0 (a) + 2S1 (a) .\nIt was proved in Proposition 1 that Zn (a) \u2208 GF(2k ) = GF(2). Thus, if Zn (a) 6= 0\nthen Zn (a) = 1 and the value of S1 (a) is defined by whether\nYn (a) = Zn2 (a) + Nn1 (a)(\u03b4 + \u03b4 \u22121 ) = 1 + \u03b4 + \u03b4 \u22121 ,\n2n\n\nwhere \u03b4 = \u03b1(2 \u22121)/3 is primitive in GF(4), is zero or not (note that a 6= 0). Since\n\u03b4 + 1 = \u03b4 2 = \u03b4 \u22121 , we have \u03b4 + \u03b4 \u22121 = 1. Therefore, if Zn (a) 6= 0 then S(a) = 2n\nand is never equal to \u22122n . This reduces the four-valued cross-correlation case to\nthree values.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have identified new pairs of m-sequences having different lengths 22nk \u2212 1 and\n22k \u2212 1, where n > 2 is odd and k > 1, with four-valued cross correlation and\nwe have completely determined the cross-correlation distribution. These pairs\ndiffer from the sequences in the Kasami family by the property that instead of\nnk +1\n.\nthe decimation d = 1 we take d = 22k +1\n\nReferences\n[1] T.
