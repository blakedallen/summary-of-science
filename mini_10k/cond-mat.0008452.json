Only tiny energy differences between different spin states cannot be resolved\nreliably. On the other hand, the charge density distribution resulting from unrestricted HF cannot quantitatively\ndescribe the strongly correlated regime. For even number of electrons per shell, the HF densities show effects of\nlocalization due to the strong electron interaction. Furthermore, within HF [9] this crystallization sets in rather\ntoo early at higher densities than in the QMC study [8].\nModel - We study a two-dimensional parabolic quantum dot with N electrons at zero magnetic field as it has\nbeen discussed by many authors [5-10]. Measuring energy in units p\nof the oscillator energy h\u0304\u03c90 and length in\nunits of l0 = h\u0304/m\u2217 \u03c90 , where m\u2217 is the effective mass,\nthe dimensionless Hamiltonian reads\n\nWe perform unrestricted Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations\nfor electrons in a parabolic quantum dot at zero magnetic\nfield. The crossover from Fermi liquid to Wigner molecule\nbehavior is studied for up to eight electrons and various spin\ncomponents Sz . We compare the results with numerically\nexact path-integral Monte Carlo simulations and earlier HF\nstudies. Even in the strongly correlated regime the symmetry breaking HF solutions provide accurate estimates for the\nenergies and describe the one-particle densities qualitatively.\nHowever, the HF approximation favors the formation of a\nWigner molecule and produces azimuthal modulations of the\ndensity for even numbers of electrons in one spatial shell.\nPACS numbers: 73.20.Dx, 71.10Ay, 71.10.Hf\n\nThe last decade has seen an enormous interest in quantum dots, i.e., a small number of 2D electrons confined\nin a semiconductor heterostructure [1]. Experimentally,\nthe N -electron states of these systems are studied by\nmeans of far-infrared [2], capacitance [3] and transport\nspectroscopy [4], and exhibit features of quantization of\ncharge and energy. Theoretically, a whole arsenal of\nmethods for interacting electronic systems together with\nincreasing computational power applies: Exact diagonalization techniques [5], density functional theory [6] and\nquantum Monte Carlo methods [7]. Recently, also the\nvery strongly correlated regime of small electronic densities has attracted considerable interest [8\u201310]. In particular, the formation of a Wigner molecule was studied with\nQuantum Monte Carlo (QMC) [8], Hartree-Fock (HF) [9]\nand configuration interaction [10] calculations.\nIn this paper we reconsider the Hartree-Fock approximation focusing on the crossover to the Wigner regime.\nAn important practical and conceptual question to be\nclarified is how correlations beyond the mean field approximation contribute to the exact energy and whether\nthe Wigner molecule is described reliably within HF. In\nits unrestricted version, allowing for symmetry-broken\nsolutions, HF approaches the true ground state energy\nconsiderably better than restricted HF which preserves\nthe rotational symmetry of the Hamiltonian. This is\nachieved, however, on expense of the quality of the wave\nfunctions.\nIn the case of a strong central potential in three dimensions, such as in real atoms, the HF approximation\nis known to yield useful results both for energies and\nwave functions. Here, we show by comparison with exact\nMonte Carlo data [8] that even for strong interaction un-\n\nH=\n\n\u2261\n\n\u0013\nN \u0012\nN\nX\nX\n1\n\u03bb\n1\n\u2212 \u2206j + r 2j +\n2\n2\n|r\n\u2212\nrj |\ni\nj=1\ni<j=1\n\nN\nX\ni=1\n\nhi +\n\nN\nX\n\nwij .\n\n(1)\n\ni<j=1\n\nHere we have introduced the dimensionless coupling constant \u03bb = l0 /a\u2217B = e2 /\u03bal0 h\u0304\u03c90 with the effective Bohr\nradius a\u2217B and the dielectric constant \u03ba. For example\n\u03bb = 2 corresponds to h\u0304\u03c90 \u2248 3meV for a GaAs quantum\ndot. Since this Hamiltonian is rotationally invariant and\nspin independent, the exact eigenfunctions can be chosen as simultaneous eigenfunctions of the total angular\n2\nmomentum Ltot\nz , the total spin S tot and its z-component\ntot\nSz . These eigenfunctions and corresponding densities\nare then rotationally invariant.\nMethod - HF theory consists in approximating the\nmany-particle wave function by an optimal single Slater\ndeterminant\n1\n\u03a8HF = \u221a\ndet (\u03c6i (r j ))1\u2264i,j\u2264N .\nN!\n\n(2)\n\nThis HF Slater determinant is build up by single particle orbitals \u03c6i (r), which are expanded in the angular\nmomentum basis of the 2D harmonic oscillator (FockDarwin states)\ns\n2\nn!\neiM\u03c6 r|M| Ln|M|(r2 ) e\u2212r /2 .\nhr|nM i =\n\u03c0(n + |M |)!\n(3)\n1\n\n\fHere, n and M are the radial and angular quantum num|M|\nbers, and Ln is a Laguerre polynomial. In the unrestricted HF approximation an orbital has the expansion\nX\nuinM hr|nM \u03c3i i ,\n(4)\n\u03c6i (r) =\n\nand triplet converge more rapidly [12]. The (absolute\nand relative) error is largest in the case of Sz = 0 and\n\u03bb \u2248 2. In the polarized case the error of HF increases\nmonotonically with \u03bb. These features of the HF energies\ncan be seen for all N .\nFor N > 2 we compare with the path integral QMC\ndata of Ref. [8], which have been obtained for the very\nlow temperature T = 0.1h\u0304\u03c90 /kB . The HF ground state\nenergies are always above the QMC energies for all particle numbers investigated so that the QMC data may\nserve effectively as zero temperature reference points. In\nthe case of N = 5 electrons, QMC gives a ground state\nspin of 1/2. In Fig. 1 we plot the energy difference of\nthe different spin states with respect to the true ground\nQMC\nstate, \u2206E = ES \u2212 E1/2\n, for various spin states as a\nfunction of the coupling strength \u03bb. Again we see that\n\u2206E is largest for \u03bb \u2248 2 and smallest spin. It remains\n> 4, resulting in a very low relative error\nconstant for \u03bb \u223c\nof only 1 \u2212 2% in the low density regime. The HF energy\nis very accurate in the case of Sz = 5/2 which becomes\n> 4. This unphysically high\nthe HF ground state for \u03bb \u223c\nground state spin is due to the exchange term in the HF\nenergy, which lowers the energy only for parallel spins.\nTherefore the spin ordering of the HF energies is just\nreversed.\nFor N = 8 we give the HF energies in Table II. The\nQMC predicts a transition of the ground state spin from\n> 4. Again HF finds the wrong spin\nS = 1 to S = 2 for \u03bb \u223c\nordering in the correlated regime. The relative error is\nlargest for the unpolarized states. The convergence of the\n> 6 can be understood\nHF energies for different Sz for \u03bb \u223c\nin the classical picture of localized electrons without overlap and therefore no spin sensitivity.\nHF densities - Next we study the HF one particle densities (6), where the crossover to the Wigner molecule\nis discernible. However, one has to keep in mind that\nthe deformation and structure of the HF densities arise\nfrom the symmetry violating mean field and therefore\nmay be artificial (whereas the HF energies are a true\nupper bounds for the ground state energies). Second we\nwant to point out that a symmetry breaking Slater determinant does not necessarily mean that its corresponding\ndensity displays a molecule-like structure. In Fig. 2 we\ndisplay the densities for N = 2 to 5 for strong coupling\n> 6 the\n\u03bb = 6 and maximal spin Sz = N/2 (From \u03bb \u223c\nHF densities are essentially the same for all spins.). In\nthe case of 2 and 4 electrons they show quite distinct azimuthal maxima. This is not the case for the odd electron\nnumbers 3 and 5: Surprisingly the HF densities, though\nbelonging to a deformed Slater determinant, seem to be\nrotationally symmetric.\nIn order to understand this even-odd effect consider\nan exact spin-polarized N -electron wave function \u03a8N for\nthe Wigner molecule case. An even number of electrons\nin one spatial shell carries a nonzero angular momen-\n\nn=0,\u221e\nM =\u2212\u221e,\u221e\n\nwhere \u03c3i = \u00b1 12 is the fixed electron spin of the i-th orbital. This orbital is no longer an eigenfunction of the one\nparticle angular momentum, therefore the HF Slater determinant is in general not an eigenfunction of Ltot\nz , but\na deformed, symmetry broken solution [11]. Similarly,\nthe HF solution is in general not an eigenfunction of the\ntotal spin but only of its P\nz-component with eigenvalue\nSztot \u2261 Sz = (N\u2191 \u2212 N\u2193 )/2 = i \u03c3i .\nMinimizing the HF energy E HF = \u03a8HF H \u03a8HF and\nimposing orthonormality between the HF orbitals yields\nthe HF equations for the expansion coefficients uinM\nX\nX\b\nh\u03b3| h |\u03b1i +\n(\u03b3\u03b2|w|\u03b1\u03b2 \u2032 )\u03c1\u03b2 \u2032 \u03b2 uk\u03b1 = \u03b5k uk\u03b3 .

The nonlinear selfconsistent eigenvalue problem (5)\nfor the expansion coefficients ui\u03b1 is solved by iterative diagonalization starting from an initial guess for the density matrix. Several starting guesses have to be chosen\nin order to avoid local minima. The true minimum can\nalso be identified by its one particle density,\nnHF (r) =\n\nN\nX\ni=1\n\n|\u03c6i (r)|2 ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhich in the strong coupling limit mirrors the geometry of classical electrostatic point-charges as we discuss\nbelow.\nIn our calculations we used up to 55 Fock-Darwin\nstates for each spin direction. We present results for various sets of N, \u03bb, Sz from N = 2 to 8 particles covering\nthe whole range of interaction strengths from \u03bb = 2 to\n10.\nHF energies and spin - The most important properties of the HF ground state energies can already be seen\nfor N = 2 (quantum dot Helium). Here one knows the\nexact solution from diagonalization of the Hamiltonian\nfor the relative motion [5]. We have reproduced these\nresults in Table I. The true ground state is always a\nsinglet and the energy gap to the triplet vanishes slowly\nas \u03bb \u2192 \u221e. In contrast, the HF approximation finds a\n> 5, and the energies of singlet\ntriplet ground state for \u03bb \u223c\n2\n\n\ftum \u00b1h\u0304N/2 [14]. In this fashion the HF wavefunctions\nwith modulated density (N = 2, 4) can be interpreted as\nstanding waves from a superposition of opposite angular\nmomenta [15].\nHowever the HF densities display the right classical\nfilling for the spatial shells: From the maxima in the\ndensities one can also read off the Brueckner parameter\nrs , which is defined as the the nearest-neighbor distance\nin units of a\u2217B . These values rs agree well with those\nobtained by QMC and from a model of classical pointcharges. In Fig. 3 we show a 7-electron Wigner molecule\nfor two interaction strengths. For \u03bb = 2 the HF density\nis already 6-fold modulated with a central electron. Confronting this with the exact density in Fig. 1 of Ref. [8],\nwe notice that the crystallization (as suggested by the HF\ndensities) occurs too early. This explains why the authors\nof Ref. [9] observe Wigner crystallization for higher densities than in the exact QMC study [8]. For higher \u03bb the\nmolecule with two spatial shells becomes more and more\ndistinct. The maxima agree\n\u221a very well with the classical\nformula rs3 = \u03bb4 (2.25 + 1/ 3) for the 6-fold geometry.\nFinally we show in Fig. 4 the crystallization for N = 6\nand Sz = 0. This unpolarized case depicts a crossover\nfrom a 6-fold arrangement [Fig. 4(a)] to a 5-fold geometry [Fig. 4(c) and (d)]. The 6-electron molecule was\nalso studied by Reimann et al. [10], who found by means\nof configuration interaction calculations that the true\nground state was unpolarized with a 6-fold symmetry\nup to at least \u03bb \u2248 3.5. Within HF the Sz = 0 state\nacquires a 5-fold symmetry already for \u03bb \u2265 2.85. In this\nrange the HF density is distorted [\u03bb = 4 in Fig. 4(c)] and\nthen again apparently round for higher lambda [\u03bb = 6 in\nFig. 4(d)] with a central maximum. Fig. 4(b) shows the\n6-fold isomer for \u03bb = 4, which is by 0.33 higher in energy\nthan the ground state in Fig. 4(c). In contrast the spinpolarized state exhibits 5-fold symmetry throughout the\nwhole parameter range [16].\nIn conclusion we have shown in how far an unrestricted\nHF description of the Wigner molecule in quantum dots\nis reliable. The HF energies are good estimates of the\ntrue ground state energies especially for spin-polarized\nstates. The energy differences for different spin-states in\nthe strong interacting regime cannot be resolved properly. We find deformed HF densities in the regime of\n< 4. For strong corintermediate interaction up to \u03bb \u223c\nrelation the densities are azimuthally modulated for an\neven number of electrons in a shell and round for an odd\nnumber per shell. The onset of this modulation is enhanced within HF, which leads to overestimate the value\nof the critical density for the crossover to the Wigner\nmolecule. However the HF densities mirror the classical filling scheme with the electrons arranged in spatial\nshells.\nWe thank R. Bl\u00fcmel, R. Egger, C. Stafford, and\nT. Vorrath for useful discussions.
