Systems with self-organized\ncriticality are naturally driven to a critical point, and\nthus can potentially explain how power laws occur in nature without any fine-tuning of parameters. Since their\nintroduction, sandpile models have been used to model\nan extraordinarily wide range of systems, from earthquakes [2] to river networks [3, 4]; see [5, 6] for reviews.\nTo be precise, we are considering the two-dimensional\nisotropic Abelian sandpile model. This is a very simple\nmodel; in fact, its simplicity is its strength, since otherwise it could not act as a model for such a diverse range\nof physical systems. The ASM is defined on a square\nlattice, where each site has a height variable (the number of grains of sand at that site) that can range from\n1 to 4. At each time step, a grain of sand is added to\na random site. Any site with more than four grains is\nunstable, and collapses, losing four grains, and sending\none grain to each of its neighbors. Unstable sites are\nrepeatedly collapsed until all sites are stable. Then, a\nnew time step begins-a grain is added to a random site,\nand the process begins anew [1]. Initially, probabilities of\nconfigurations will depend on the initial conditions, but\nafter a long period of time, the ASM develops a welldefined probability distribution of states, independent of\nthe initial conditions [7]. Typically, the number of grains\nis conserved in each toppling, except for sites along open\nboundaries, where grains are lost with each toppling (i.e.\nfall off the edge). There must be at least one dissipative\nsite-i.e. at least one site where the number of grains decreases upon toppling-or else the sandpile would even-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: mjeng@siue.edu\n\ntually reach a state where topplings continued endlessly\nduring a single time step.\nDespite its simplicity, certain basic properties of the\nASM remain unknown. For example, despite intensive\nwork, the power law governing the sizes of avalanches\nin the ASM is still unknown-see [8] for a review. And\nwhile the height one variable is well understood, the roles\nplayed by the higher height variables (two, three, and\nfour) are not. For example, no bulk two-point correlation\nfunctions of higher height variables are known.\nIt is known that the ASM is related to the set of spanning trees that can be drawn on the sandpile lattice, and\nthat this relationship can be used to perform exact calculations of ASM probabilities [7, 9]. A spanning tree is\na set of arrows drawn on the lattice, such that each site\nhas exactly one arrow pointing from the site to a neighbor, and such that there are no closed loops of arrows.\nFollowing the path of arrows from any site will eventually\nlead off the edge of the sandpile (or, more generally, to\na dissipative site, such as found on an open boundary)-\nthe \"site\" off the edge of the sandpile is called the root.\nA number of relationships between the ASM and spanning tree states are known. For example, the number\nof recurrent states of the ASM (states that occur with\nnonzero probability after a long amount of time) is equal\nto the number of spanning trees that can be drawn on\nthe sandpile lattice [9].\nSpanning trees are, in turn, related to the c = \u22122\nconformal field theory (CFT). The c = \u22122 CFT is the\nsimplest known example of a logarithmic conformal field\ntheory (LCFT), and is well understood [11\u201313].\nA method introduced by Majumdar and Dhar exploits the mapping between ASM states and spanning\ntree states to obtain exact ASM probabilities [14]. It\nhas long been known that the Majumdar-Dhar method\ncan be used to find the two-point correlation function\nof the unit height variable, which decays as 1/r4 [14].\nMore recently, Mahieu and Ruelle used the Majumdar-\n\n\f2\nDhar method to calculate correlation functions of a number of ASM height configurations, known as weakly allowed cluster variables [15]. They not only found that\nall the correlations decayed as 1/r4 , but were able to\nuse their correlations to identify the thirteen simplest\nweakly allowed cluster variables with operators in the\nLCFT. These variables were all identified with linear\ncombinations of three LCFT field operators, all of which\nhad scaling dimension two, but only one of which-the\n \u0304 \u03b8\u0304 operator-was isotropic. In some ways, this\n\u2202\u03b8\u2202 \u0304\u03b8\u0304 + \u2202\u03b8\u2202\nsuggested that the higher height variables should be iden \u0304 \u03b8\u0304; on the other hand, Mahieu and\ntified with \u2202\u03b8\u2202 \u0304\u03b8\u0304 + \u2202\u03b8\u2202\nRuelle pointed out that this appeared inconsistent with\nLCFT operator product expansions (OPE's).\nDespite the power of these mappings, and of the\nMajumdar-Dhar method, fundamental questions about\nthe ASM remain unanswered, because aspects of the\nmapping between the ASM and c = \u22122 LCFT are still\nunknown-for example, it is not known what field operators in the c = \u22122 LCFT represent the higher height\nvariables of the ASM (or, indeed, whether such a representation even exists). A single site with height two,\nor any higher height variable, is not a weakly allowed\ncluster, and thus higher height probabilities and correlations cannot be calculated with the Majumdar-Dhar\nmethod. Priezzhev was able to extend the MajumdarDhar method to calculate the bulk probabilites for all\nhigher height variables [10]. However, the bulk correlations of the higher height variables, which would be\nneeded to obtain the field identifications of the higher\nheight variables, remain unknown.\nIvashkevich calculated all two-point correlation functions of all height variables, along open and closed boundaries [16]. He found that all boundary correlations, between all height variables, decayed as 1/r4 , and argued\nthat this implied that all four height variables should be\nrepresented by the same field operator (up to rescaling).\nDhar has argued that, based on clustering properties of\ncorrelation functions, the bulk correlations should be expected to factorize in a manner consistent with giving all\nfour height variables the same field identification [17].\nHowever, we argue here that the four height variables\nshould in fact receive different field identifications, both\nalong closed boundaries, and in the bulk, and propose\nfield identifications along closed boundaries. Our conclusions are based on analysis of closed boundary threepoint functions, and of dissipative defect sites, as well as\na reanalysis of the methods and results of Ivashkevich.\nHowever, we show that along open boundaries all four\nheight variables, as well as dissipative defect sites, are\nrepresented by the same operator, \u2202\u03b8\u2202 \u03b8\u0304, in the c = \u22122\nLCFT. We demonstrate this by computing all n-point\ncorrelations of height variables and dissipative defects.\nIn sections II and III we briefly review the methods\nused by Majumdar, Dhar, and Priezzhev for studying the\nASM. In section IV, we review Ivashkevich's calculations\nof the boundary height probabilities.\nIn section V, and appendices A and B, we discuss issues\n\nassociated with boundary correlation functions. While\nIvashkevich has already calculated the boundary twopoint correlations [16], we show that he mischaracterized\nthe mapping between ASM configurations and spanning\ntree configurations, and a correct characterization results\nin a number of complications, necessitating a reanalysis\nof the two-point correlations. The relationship between\nASM states and spanning tree states is not what one\nmight have initially expected; we also note that linear\nrelationships between nonlocal spanning tree conditions\nand local spanning tree conditions for one-point probabilities do not carry over in a simple fashion for multipoint\ncorrelation functions. Both of these complications introduce what we call \"anomalous graphs\"-while these complications are important, because they are technical in\nnature, we delegate much of the discussion to the appendices. In section V we calculate the anomalous graphs,\nand conjecture that the anomalous graphs have no effect on the universal parts of any boundary correlation\nfunctions; while we have not been able to prove this conjecture, it holds true for all correlation functions that we\nhave calculated.\nIn section VI, we look at correlation functions along\nclosed boundaries. For two-point correlation functions,\nwe find that while we disagree with Ivashkevich's relationship between ASM and spanning tree states, we agree\nwith his final results. However, we argue that these final results are, in fact, not consistent with identifying all\nheight variables with the same field operator. Next, we\ncalculate all three-point functions along closed boundaries that involve at least one unit height variable, and\nuse these to make field identifications along closed boundaries. Selected three-point functions appear in Eqs. (1719), and we state the field identifications in Eqs. (20-22).\nNext, in section VII, we introduce the concept of a dissipative defect site, and discuss its effect on the lattice\nGreen functions for the open, closed, and bulk cases. In\nsection VIII, we show that in the closed and bulk cases,\ndissipative defects have no effects on any weakly allowed\ncluster variables. This demonstrates that an analysis of\nweakly allowed cluster variables, such as that in [15], cannot provide a complete picture of the ASM. Our results\nimply, as a particular case, that dissipative defects in the\nclosed and bulk cases have no effect on the unit height\nprobability, or on correlations of unit heights. They do,\nhowever, have an effect on the higher height variables; we\nshow this analytically for the closed case, in Eqs. (28-29),\nand have checked this numerically for the bulk case.\nIn sections IX, X, and XI, we compute all n-point correlation functions, for any number of height variables,\nand with any number of dissipative defects, along open\nboundaries. We find that there, all four height variables,\nand dissipative defects, are all represented by the same\ndimension two field, \u2202\u03b8\u2202 \u03b8\u0304. In fact, all local arrow diagrams along open boundaries are represented by \u2202\u03b8\u2202 \u03b8\u0304,\nup to multiplicative prefactors.\nA short summary of these results can be found at [18].\n\n\f3\nII.\n\nMETHODS FOR ANALYSING THE ASM\n\nAt its core, the ASM is a tractable model because the\nsandpile model has an Abelian structure; the state of the\nsandpile does not depend on the order in which grains are\nadded to the sites [7]. As a result of this Abelian structure, it can be shown that the states of the sandpile fall\ninto two simple categories. Some of the 4N states of the\nsandpile (where N is the number of sites) are transient,\nwhich means that they can occur early in the ASM's evolution, but occur with zero probability after an infinitely\nlong time. The other states are recurrent, and all occur\nwith equal probability after long times. So the probability for a property X to occur is nothing more than the\nfraction of recurrent states having property X.\nTo analyze the sandpile, it is convenient to allow more\ngeneral toppling rules. We characterize the sandpile by\na toppling matrix, \u2206~i ~j , where ~i and ~j are any lattice\nsites. ~i topples if its height is ever greater than \u2206~i ~i , at\nwhich point its height goes down by \u2206~i ~i , and the height\nof every other site ~j goes up by \u2212\u2206~i ~j \u2265 0 (\u2206~i ~j = 0 if ~i\nand ~j are not neighbors). The original ASM, described\nin the introduction, has \u2206~i ~j = 4 when ~i = ~j (or \u2206~i ~j = 3\nwhen ~i = ~j is along a closed boundary), \u2206~i ~j = \u22121 when\n~i and ~j are nearest neighbors, and \u2206~ ~ = 0 otherwise.\nij\n\nDhar was able to show that the number of recurrent\nstates, given very general restrictions on \u2206, is equal to\ndet(\u2206) [7]. However, det(\u2206) is also known to be equal\nto the number of spanning trees that can be drawn on\nthe lattice [9]. In the spanning tree representation, \u2206~i ~i\nindicates the number of neighbors that the arrow from ~i\ncan point to, \u2206~i ~j = \u22121 if an arrow can point from ~i to\n~j, and \u2206~ ~ = 0 otherwise.\nij\n\nCertain height probabilities in the ASM can be equated\nwith probabilities for spanning trees to have particular\narrow configurations. Probabilities for some arrow configurations can be computed simply by modfiying the\ntoppling matrix from \u2206 to \u2206\u2032 , in a way that enforces\nthat arrow configuration. Then, the number of spanning\ntrees with the configuration is det(\u2206\u2032 ), and the probability of the configuration is det(\u2206\u2032 )/ det(\u2206). Defining\nB \u2261 \u2206\u2032 \u2212 \u2206, the probability becomes\ndet(\u2206\u2032 )\n= det(I + BG).\ndet(\u2206)\n\u22121\n\nof sites on each end is decreased by one; so the three\nsites adjacent to ~i get maximum heights of 3, and ~i gets\na maximum height of 4-3=1. It is not difficult to show\nthat recurrent states S (of the original ASM) where ~i has\nheight one are in one-to-one correspondence with the recurrent states S \u2032 of the cut ASM. In this correspondence,\nwe map from S to S \u2032 by lowering the heights of each of\nthe three sites cut off from ~i by one. Letting ~j1 , ~j2 , and\n~j3 , be the three the neighbors that ~i has been cut off\nfrom, we have\n~i ~j1 ~j2 ~j3\n\u22123\n\uf8ec 1\nB = \uf8ed\n1\n1\n\uf8eb\n\n1\n\u22121\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n\u22121\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n1\n0 \uf8f7\n0 \uf8f8\n\u22121\n\n~i\n~j1\n~j2\n~j3\n\n(2)\n\nThen the unit height probability is det(I + BG) = 2(\u03c0 \u2212\n2)/\u03c0 3 . This method was also used by Majumdar and\nDhar to calculate the two-point correlation of the unit\nheight variable [14].\nPriezzhev extended the Majumdar-Dhar method to allow for the calculation of diagrams with closed loops.\nWith the basic Majumdar-Dhar method, all off-diagonal\nentries of the toppling matrix are either 0 or -1. Priezzhev proved that if in \u2206\u2032 we set n off-diagonal entries of\n\u2206 to \u2212\u01eb, then\ndet(\u2206\u2032 )\n\u01eb\u2192\u221e\n\u01ebn\nlim\n\n(3)\n\nis equal to the number of arrow configurations such that\neach of the n corresponding arrows is in a closed loop\nof arrows, where each closed loop contributes a factor of\n\u22121, and there are no closed loops other than those going\nthrough these n bonds.\nSuch configurations are not spanning trees; spanning\ntrees cannot have any closed loops. However, Priezzhev\nfound that to calculate certain spanning tree probabilities, he needed to calculate graphs that had closed loops\n(\u03b8-graphs). We find this method useful for the calculation of certain closed boundary correlations.\nIII.\n\nHEIGHT PROBABILITIES\n\n(1)\n\nG \u2261 \u2206 is the well-known lattice Green function [24]\n(see appendix C). If \u2206\u2032 only differs from \u2206 in a finite\nnumber of entries, then B is finite-dimensional, and the\nprobability can be easily computed.\nMajumdar and Dhar used this method to find the probability for a site ~i to have unit height [14]. To do this,\nthey defined a modified, or \"cut\" ASM, in which three\nof the four bonds connecting ~i to nearest neighbors are\nremoved. When a bond is removed, the maximum height\n\nPriezzhev determined a relationship between higher\nheight probabilities and spanning tree states, which we\nreview here [10].\nCentral to our analysis is the concept of forbidden subconfigurations (FSCs). A forbidden subconfiguration is a\nsubset F of the lattice, such that for all ~i \u2208 F , h~i \u2264 c~i (F ),\nwhere h~i is the height of site ~i, and c~i (F ) is number of\nneighbors that ~i has in F . Majumdar and Dhar proved\nthat a state of the ASM is recurrent if and only if it has\nno FSC's [7, 9].\n\n\f4\nThe probability for a site ~i to have height two is more\ncomplicated than the height one probability [10]. In this\ncase, changing the site height to one could either leave\nthe ASM in an allowed (recurrent) state, or produce an\nFSC. The first case just gives the height one probability,\nwhich has already been calculated, so we consider the second case. Changing the height of ~i from two to one can\nproduce multiple FSC's. Let F be the maximal forbidden subconfiguration (MFSC) produced by this change.\n(Because more than one FSC can be produced, the word\n\"maximal\" is necessary for complete precision, and for\nthis mapping to work; Priezzhev simply referred to \"the\"\nFSC, but this does not introduce any errors in his analysis [10].) F must contain ~i, and exactly one of the neighbors of ~i, and be simply connected, but can otherwise\nhave arbitrary shape. The states S of the original ASM\nwhere changing the height of ~i from two to one produces\nF as the MFSC are in one-to-one correspondence with\nstates S \u2032 of a modified ASM. In the modified ASM, all\nthe bonds bordering F are removed, except for one (arbitrarily chosen) bond of ~i. In the correspondence, we map\nfrom S to S \u2032 by lowering heights of all sites that border\nF by the number of neighbors of F that they have been\ncut off from. (In this mapping, heights in F are unaffected.) With this mapping, the state S has no FSC's\nin the original ASM if and only if the state S \u2032 has no\nFSC's in the cut ASM. (Priezzhev's explanation used a\nslightly different, but equivalent, argument, based on the\nburning algorithm, a method for determining if a state is\nrecurrent [7, 10]).\nThe site ~i is called a predecessor of the site ~j in the\nspanning tree if the path from ~i to the root goes through\n~j. We define NNP~, as the number of nearest-neighbors\ni\nof ~i that are predecessors of ~i. Then, the correspondence\nabove shows that the number of states of the modified\nASM is equal to the number of spanning trees of the\nmodified lattice, which is in turn equal to the number of\nspanning trees where F is the set of predecessors of ~i.\nSumming over all possible sets F , we simply obtain the\nnumber of spanning trees where NNP~i = 1.\nSimilarly, it can be shown that the number of ASM\nstates allowed when ~i has height h (or greater) but forbidden when ~i has height h \u2212 1 (or less), is equal to the\nnumber of spanning trees where NNP~i = h\u22121. Thus, the\nprobability PASM (h) for the site to have exactly height\nh in the ASM is\n\nPASM (h) =\n\nh\nX\nPSpT r (u \u2212 1)\n,\nm~i + 1 \u2212 u\nu=1\n\n(4)\n\nwhere PSpT r (u \u2212 1) is the probability that a randomly\nchosen spanning tree will have NNP~i = u \u2212 1, and mi is\nthe maximum possible height of ~i. (m~i = 4 in the bulk,\nand along open boundaries, while m~i = 3 along closed\nboundaries.) For more details, see [10].\nThis gives an exact representation of ASM height probabilities in terms of spanning tree probabilities.

Spanning tree probabilities that correspond to local restrictions on the spanning tree can be calculated\nwith the Majumdar-Dhar method. However, the statement that NNP~i = u \u2212 1 is a nonlocal restriction on the\nspanning tree (for u > 1). Priezzhev was able to calculate these nonlocal probabilities, but his calculations were\ncomplicated, and do not appear to be easily extensible to\ncalculation of bulk correlations. However, this problem\nturns out to be more tractable along a boundary.\n\nIV.\n\nBOUNDARY HEIGHT PROBABILITIES\n\nFor sites at the boundary, the relationship between\nheight probabilities and NNP's still holds, and the NNP\ncondition is still nonlocal. Nevertheless, Ivashkevich was\nable to show, through an ingenious transformation, that\nthe ASM height probabilities are much easier to calculate\nalong boundaries [16].\nIn figure 1 we list all possible nonlocal arrow configurations around a site ~i of a closed boundary. In each\npicture, the dashed line is the boundary, and the central\nsite is ~i. Large, solid, circles are predecessors of ~i, while\nlarge, open, circles are not. We see explicitly that the\npredecessor relationships are nonlocal. \u03b21 and \u03c61 differ\nonly in whether the site above ~i leads to ~i by a chain of\narrows-since the chain of arrows can go through sites\n\n\f5\n*\n\n2Lc,1=\n\n+\n\nc=\n2Lc,2=\n\n+\n\n2Lc,3=\n\n+\n\nV.\n\nLc,4=\n2Lc,5=\n\nFIG. 3: Anomalous graph of the first kind arising in the calculation of the two-point function.\n\n+\n\nFIG. 2: Local arrow diagrams along closed boundaries.\n\ndistant from ~i, this is a nonlocal distinction. If we can\nfigure out the probabilities of all these diagrams, we can\nfigure out the NNP probabilities (and thus the height\nprobabilities). For example, the probability for NNP~i = 1\nis simply 2\u03b21 + 2\u03b22 + 2\u03b3, since these diagrams catalogue\nall the ways that ~i can have exactly one NNP.\nThese nonlocal diagrams are difficult to calculate. On\nthe other hand, local restrictions are easily calculated\nwith the Majumdar-Dhar method. All local arrow diagrams along closed boundaries are shown in figure 2.\nNote that these diagrams do not have solid or open circles, because predecessor relationships are not specified\nin local diagrams. Ivashkevich pointed out that the local\narrow diagrams could be written as linear combinations\nof nonlocal arrow diagrams. For example, looking at figures 1 and 2, we see that Lc,1 = \u03c61 + \u03b21 . At first sight,\nthere are more nonlocal arrow diagrams than local arrow\ndiagrams, so such linear relationships would not appear\nto let us solve for the nonlocal arrow diagrams. However,\nIvashkevich also pointed out that certain nonlocal arrow\ndiagrams are equal in probability-for example, \u03c61 and\n\u03c62 are equal in probability, because we can make a oneto-one mapping from \u03c61 to \u03c62 by reversing all arrows\nin the long path of \u03c61 , and then switching the incoming arrow to ~i. Similarly, \u03b21 = \u03b22 . Then, we have as\nmany nonlocal diagrams as local diagrams, and can solve\nfor the nonlocal arrow diagrams. (In fact, along open\nboundaries, the number of local diagrams is one greater\nthan the number of nonlocal arrow diagrams, so that the\nsystem is overconstrained, providing a check on the calculations.) Ivashkevich used this to calculate all height\nprobabilities along open and closed boundaries. See [16]\nfor the full list of linear relationships between local and\nnonlocal diagrams.\n\nBOUNDARY TWO-POINT CORRELATIONS\nAND ANOMALOUS GRAPHS\n\nThe calculation of boundary correlations is much more\ndifficult. We show in appendix A that Ivashkevich's calculation of the two-point functions was incorrect, and\nignored complications that arise in the relationship between ASM height correlations and spanning tree correlations (although his end result turns out to be correct). In\nappendix B, we discuss further complications that arise\nin transforming from nonlocal spanning tree correlations\nto local spanning tree correlations. We summarize the results here, and analyze the resulting \"anomalous graphs\".\nThe first complication arises in the correspondence between ASM height probabilities and spanning tree probabilities. It would be natural to think that, analogously\nto Eq. (4), the ASM probability, PASM (h~i , h~j ), for the\nsites ~i and ~j to have exactly heights h~i and h~j should be\ngiven by\nh~i h~j\n? X\nX\nPASM (h~i , h~j ) =\nu=1 v=1\n\nPSpT r (u \u2212 1, v \u2212 1)\n,\n(m~i + 1 \u2212 u)(m~j + 1 \u2212 v)\n\n(5)\nwhere PSpT r (u \u2212 1, v \u2212 1) is the probability that in a\nspanning tree, NNP~i = u\u22121 and NNP~j = v\u22121. However,\nthis turns out to not be quite the case. Eq. (5) is a natural\nguess, which we call a \"naive\" approach, but as shown in\nappendix A, the left and right sides of Eq. (5) differ by a\nsubset of spanning trees that we call anomalous graphs\nof the first kind. (These graphs are not anomalous in\nany physical sense; we simply mean that they differ from\nwhat we would get, using a certain naive starting point.)\nThe set of anomalous graphs of the first kind, for the\nclosed case, is shown in figure 3. (We represent the root\nwith a star.) In the graph, NNP~i = NNP~j = 1, so this\ngraph appears in the right-hand side of Eq. (5) for h~i =\nh~j = 2. However, we show in appendix A that this graph\ndoes not contribute to the 2-2 (height two-height two)\ncorrelation, but instead contributes to the 2-3 and 3-2\ncorrelations, and gets subtracted from the 3-3 correlation.\nSecond, leaving aside for now the anomalous graphs of\nthe first kind, we need to calculate correlations of nonlocal arrow diagrams. It would be convenient if we could\nuse the linear relationships relating nonlocal arrow diagrams to local arrow diagrams found for one-point func-\n\n\f6\ntions (section IV), and use them independently at ~i and\nat ~j for two-point functions. We again call this approach\n\"naive,\" and again, this approach does not quite work.\nThe problem arises because for one-point functions, we\ntreated \u03c61 and \u03c62 as equivalent, based on a one-to-one\ncorrespondence in which a long path was reversed. In a\ncorrelation function of nonlocal arrow diagrams, the long\npath from a \u03c61 at ~i may go through arrow constraints\nnear ~j, which are not free to be reversed. We discuss this\nproblem in detail in appendix B. Consideration of this\nproblem shows that, relative to the naive approach, our\nresults are changed by graphs a and b, shown in figure 4.\nWe call these anomalous graphs of the second kind.\n\na=\n\nb=\n\nFIG. 4: Anomalous graphs of the second kind arising in the\ncalculation of the two-point functions.\n\n*\n\nb=\n\n*\n\n=\n\n=\n\n\u2212\n\n=\n\n\u2212\nb1 term\n\nb2 term\n\n+\nb3 term\nFIG. 5: Anomalous graph b as a linear combination of closed\nloop diagrams.\n\nThe anomalous graphs a, b, and c can be calculated\nwith the extension of the method of Priezzhev, discussed\nin section II [10]. We discuss only the calculation of the\nb term; the analysis of the other terms is similar.\nb represents a subset of spanning trees, and thus cannot\nhave any closed loops. However, it comes \"very close\" to\nhaving a closed loop that includes the distant sites ~i and\n~j, and we see in figure 5 that b can be written as a sum\nof closed loop diagrams.\n\nPriezzhev's method allows us to calculate the closed\nloop diagrams. We represent an arrow whose weight in \u2206\nis set to \u2212\u01eb (\u01eb \u2192 \u221e) with a wavy bond line. As discussed\nin section II, these bonds must be part of a closed loop,\nand we get a factor of \u22121 for every closed loop. This\ngives the relations in figure 6. Taking the difference of\nthe two graphs in figure 6 then gives the value of a closed\nloop diagrams that goes through both ~i and ~j. Using this\nmethod, we find the number of diagrams b1, b2, and b3\n(labeled in figure 5), as ratios of N , the total number of\nspanning trees:\n\nNb1\n1\n(3\u03c0 \u2212 8)2 (\u03c0g(x) \u2212 1) (\u2212128 + 48\u03c0 + \u03c0 2 ) + (256 \u2212 192\u03c0 + 30\u03c0 2 )\u03c0g(x)\n+\n+ O( 6 )\n(6)\n=\n4\n2\n4\nN\n4\u03c0 x\n16\u03c0x\nx\n1\n(3\u03c0 \u2212 8)2 (\u03c0g(x) \u2212 1) (3\u03c0 \u2212 8)(2\u03c0g(x) \u2212 1) (3\u03c0 \u2212 8)((4 \u2212 \u03c0) + (3\u03c0 \u2212 8)\u03c0g(x))\nNb2\n+\n+\n+ O( 5 )\n(7)\n=\nN\n2\u03c0 4 x2\n4\u03c0 3 x3\n2\u03c0 4 x4\nx\n1\n(3\u03c0 \u2212 8)2 (\u03c0g(x) \u2212 1) (3\u03c0 \u2212 8)(2\u03c0g(x) \u2212 1) (\u2212128 + 48\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 2 ) + (256 \u2212 192\u03c0 + 42\u03c0 2 )\u03c0g(x)\nNb3\n+\n+\n+ O( 5 )\n=\n4\n2\n3\n3\n4\nN\n4\u03c0 x\n4\u03c0 x\n16\u03c0x\nx\n(8)\n\nx is the separation between ~i and ~j along the defect.\ng(x) is the Green function between ~i and ~j, and diverges\nas ln(L), where L is the system size (it also diverges\nas ln(x)). The restriction that spanning trees should\nhave no closed loops greatly limits the number of pos-\n\nsible spanning trees, when the outlets to the root (open\nboundaries) are very far away. So diagrams such as b1,\nb2, and b3, that allow a closed loop, are much more numerous than diagrams of spanning trees.\nHowever, to find b, we take the linear combination,\n\n\f7\n\n=\n\u2212\n\n=\n=\n\nFIG. 6: Use of -\u01eb weight bonds to evaluate closed loop diagrams.\n\n(Nb1 \u2212 Nb2 + Nb3 )/N , and the ln(L) divergences cancel\n(this provides a check on our calculations). a and c can\nbe found similarly. We find\n\nVI. TWO- AND THREE-POINT CLOSED\nBOUNDARY CORRELATION FUNCTIONS\n\nWe define, for all correlation functions along closed\nboundaries,\n3\u03c0 \u2212 8\n1\n+ O( 5 )\n2\u03c0 3 x4\nx\n3\u03c0 \u2212 8\n1\nb =\n+ O( 5 )\n2\u03c0 3 x4\nx\n1\nc = O( 6 )\nx\n\na =\n\n(9)\n(10)\n(11)\n\na and b are both of order 1/x4 . The two-point correlation functions turn out to decay as 1/x4 , so the anomalous graphs could, in principle, affect the universal parts\nof the correlation functions. However, the anomalous\ngraphs of the second kind come in the combination (a\u2212b)\n(see Eqs. (B5-B7)). So their total contributions to the\ntwo-point correlations are O(1/x5 ), and can be dropped.\nThe end result is rather surprising. A \"naive\" approach might simply apply the relationship between ASM\nstates and NNP conditions found for the one-point functions, independently at ~i and ~j (i.e. extend Eq. (4) to\nEq. (5)), and then apply the relationships between nonlocal arrow diagrams and local arrow diagrams found for\nthe one-point functions, independently at ~i and ~j. Neither of these steps is correct, and a correct analysis produces correction terms (the anomalous graphs) to this\nnaive approach. But, somehow, the anomalous graphs,\nwhile nonzero, produce no correction to the leadingorder, universal results at any stage of the computation;\nthe naive approach gives the answers. In fact, we find in\nthe following sections that the naive approach again gives\ncorrect results for all three-point closed boundary correlations that we have calculated, and for all open boundary\ncorrelations. This leads us to conjecture that the naive\napproach always produces correct universal results, for\nall correlations. If this conjecture were proven true, it\nwould greatly simplify further calculations-for example,\nthe anomalous diagrams have prevented us from calculating the 2-2-2 correlation along closed boundaries.\n\nfc (a1 , a2 , . . . , an ) =\nh(\u03b4hx1 ,a1 \u2212 pa1 ,c ) . . .

(There is a\nmisprint in the result for fc (3, 3) in [16].)\nIvashkevich argued that the fact that all two-point correlations decay as 1/(x1 \u2212 x2 )4 indicates that all three\nheight variables are represented by the same field operator. However, if all height variables were represented by\nthe same operator, we would expect the two-point functions to factorize, as\n\nfc (u, v) = \u2212\n\nKu Kv\n(x1 \u2212 x2 )4\n\n;\n\nu, v \u2208 {1, 2, 3} ,\n\n(16)\n\nfor some constants Ku .

(We will see later that the\nopen boundary correlations do, however, factorize in this\nmanner, for all n-point correlations.)\nTo clarify the field identifications, we have calculated\nall three-point functions along closed boundaries, where\nat least one of the heights is the unit height.

Note that the boundary\ncorrelations in Eqs. (17-19) are the same as the bulk correlations of Eqs. (20-22), and that while the c = \u22122 CFT\ncontains holomorphic and antiholomorphic fields (the \u2202\nand \u2202 \u0304 of Eq. (E1)), the fields in Eqs. (20-22) contain\nonly holomorphic fields. This is consistent with boundary\nCFT. While fields in the bulk generally have holomorphic\nand antiholomorphic parts, near a boundary the antiholomorphic pieces behave, in all correlation functions, like\nholomorphic pieces at mirror positions across the boundary [19].\n\nIt is also consistent to make the substitution \u03b8 \u2192 \u03b8\u0304,\n\u03b8\u0304 \u2192 \u2212\u03b8 in these field identifications, as the c = \u22122 LCFT\nis symmetric under this transformation (see Eq. (E1)).\nThe fact that the field identifications for the height\nvariables differ along a closed boundary proves that they\nmust also differ in the bulk. This is because in a CFT,\nboundary operators are derived from operator product\nexpansions (OPE's) of bulk operators [19]. Furthermore,\nin appendix F we present a simple argument, based on\ngeneral CFT principles, and not on any detailed calculations, that the height variables must have different field\nidentifications in the bulk.\nWe have not been able to calculate three-point correlation functions that have no unit height variables. The\nbasic problem is with the anomalous diagrams that arise\nwhen we convert from nonlocal arrow diagrams to local\narrow diagrams (as in appendix B). The trick shown\nin figure 6, for evaluating the resultant closed loop diagrams, does not work for these three-point functions. We\nnote that if we use the conjecture proposed in section V\n(i.e., ignore the anomalous graphs), we obtain\n(24 \u2212 5\u03c0)(\u2212576 + 384\u03c0 \u2212 61\u03c0 2 )\n+ ...,\n4\u03c0 6 (x1 \u2212 x2 )2 (x1 \u2212 x3 )2 (x2 \u2212 x3 )2\n(23)\n(and other three-point functions consistent with the requirement that all three height probabilities must sum\nto one at any site). This correlation function is consistent with the field identification in Eq. (21), providing\nsupport for our conjecture.\nfc (2, 2, 2) = \u2212\n\nVII.\n\nDISSIPATIVE DEFECT SITES, GENERAL\n\nWe now consider the effects of dissipative defects on\nthe ASM. Generally, at sites in the bulk, or along closed\nboundaries, the number of grains is conserved at each\ntoppling. Usually, it is only at open boundaries that\nthe number of grains is not conserved; there, of the four\ngrains toppled, three grains are sent to neighbors, while\nthe remaining grain goes off the edge of the sandpile, to\nthe root.\nSome dissipation (i.e. sites where topplings remove\ngrains from the sandpile) is necessary for the sandpile\nmodel to be well defined, since otherwise we would end up\nwith states where the topplings never terminated. Nevertheless, dissipation often plays a minor role in analysis\nof the sandpile, because properties are often studied in\nthe bulk of the ASM, with the dissipative sites along the\nopen boundaries infinitely far away.\nSome previous studies have investigated the effect of\nadding dissipation throughout the bulk of the ASM. Instead of having bulk sites topple when their height is\ngreater than 4, they topple when their height is greater\nthan 4 + k (k > 0). Then, one grain is sent to each\nof the four neighbors, and k grains are lost to the root.\nIt has been shown, both numerically and analytically,\n\n\f9\nthat if this is done at all sites, the ASM is taken off\nthe critical point, and the power law correlations are destroyed [20\u201322]. This happens even when k is infinitesimal. (Although this modification to the ASM has its\nmost obvious interpretation for integer k, the theory can\nbe given a sensible interpretation for any rational value\nof k. See [20] for details.) More recently, Mahieu and\nRuelle have demonstrated the precise manner in which\ndissipation throughout the bulk takes the ASM off the\ncritical point. They found that the dissipation has exactly the same effect on correlation functions of weakly\nallowed cluster variables, as adding the integral of the dimension 0 variable, \u03b8\u03b8\u0304, to the c = \u22122 CFT [15]. Adding\ndissipation along a line has been shown to split the ASM\ninto two separate half-planes, each with open boundary\nconditions [23].\nHere, we consider the effect of adding dissipation at\nonly a single defect site. Then, the methods of Majumdar\nand Dhar still work, but we need to use a modified lattice\nGreen function. If k grains of sand are dissipated at the\n~ then we call k the \"strength\" of the\nlattice position d,\ndefect. The toppling matrix is then changed from the\ndefect-free toppling matrix, \u22060 , to\n\u2206~i,~j = \u22060;~i,~j + k\u03b4~i,d~ \u03b4~j,d~\n\n(24)\n\nThe Green function is simply the inverse of the toppling\nmatrix, and is changed from the defect-free Green function, G0 (described in appendix C), to\nG(~i, ~j) = G0 (~i, ~j) \u2212\n\nk\n~ d)\n~\n1 + kG0 (d,\n\n~ 0 (d,\n~ ~j) (25)\nG0 (~i, d)G\n\nThis holds for any value of k, and regardless of the location of the defect. Nevertheless, the defect behaves very\ndifferently in the open case, and in the closed/bulk cases.\nThis is because the Green function between nearby lattice sites is O(1) near an open boundary, but O(ln L)\nnear a closed boundary, or in the bulk [24, 25]. L is the\nsystem size, or more generally, is of the same order-ofmagnitude as the distance to the nearest open boundary.\nThis divergence in the Green function as L \u2192 \u221e for the\nclosed and bulk cases is usually not an issue, since in most\ncases, we are concerned with differences in Green functions. However, here the divergence of all the G0 terms\nmakes Eq. (25) unwieldy, although technically correct.\n(Eq. (25) can be used in the open case without modification.) We work in a limit where the distances between ~i,\n~ while possibly large, are all much less than L.\n~j, and d,\nIn this limit, dropping terms of order 1/(ln L), Eq. (25)\nbecomes\n~ \u2212 G0 (d,\n~ ~j) + G0 (d,\n~ d)\n~ (26)\nG(~i, ~j) = G0 (~i, ~j) \u2212 G0 (~i, d)\nNote that Eq. (26) is independent of k. This makes sense,\nsince in the bulk, or along a closed boundary, spanning\n\ntrees have to travel far to reach the root. But with the\ndefect given by Eq. (25), k bonds are added from the\ndefect d~ to the root. Adding a dissipative defect provides\nsuch an \"easy\" way to reach the root, that with high\nprobability (probability one as L \u2192 \u221e), all nearby points\nwill be predecessors of the dissipative defect, regardless\nof the value of k. The set of spanning trees will thus\nbe the same, in the L \u2192 \u221e limit, for any k. Note also\nthat the Green function in Eq. (26) no longer diverges as\nL \u2192 \u221e, which is appropriate, as we are no longer O(L)\nfrom any dissipative sites.\nVIII.\n\nDISSIPATIVE DEFECT SITES, CLOSED\nAND BULK CASES\n\nSurprisingly, it turns out that a dissipative defect, either in the bulk, or on or near a closed boundary, has\nno effect on any weakly allowed cluster variables in the\nASM. Weakly allowed cluster variables are height configurations that result in a subconfiguration that contains\nan FSC if any height in the configuration is reduced by\none [26]. Examples of weakly allowed cluster variables\nare a single height one variable, or a height one adjacent\nto a height two. Such variables can be calculated with\nthe Majumdar-Dhar method by the removal of a set of\nbonds in the ASM/spanning tree. We note that correlations of weakly allowed cluster variables (such as all\ncorrelations of the unit height variable) are also weakly\nallowed cluster variables.\nProbabilities of weakly allowed cluster variables can be\ncalculated as det(I + BG), as in section II. To analyze\nthe effects of the defect, we want to consider the effect of\nmodifying the Green function from the defect-free Green\nfunction G0 , to the Green function in Eq. (26), for a\nfixed matrix B (i.e. for a specific weakly allowed cluster\nvariable).\nIn general, for local arrow restrictions, each row of B\nmust sum to zero, because if the restrictions on the spanning trees prevent an arrow from ~i to ~j, then B~i,~i goes\ndown by 1, while B~i,~j goes up by 1. (For example, for the\nheight one variable, the matrix B in Eq. (2) arises from\nthe restriction that no arrows can point from ~i to ~j1 , ~j2 ,\nor ~j3 , nor from ~j1 , ~j2 , or ~j3 to ~i.) For the weakly allowed\ncluster variables, B is symmetric, since if the arrow from\n~i to ~j is forbidden, then so is the arrow from ~j to ~i. So\nevery column of B also sums to zero.\nSince every row of B sums to zero, the parts of G that\nare independent of the row index of G make no contribution to BG, and thus no contribution to the probability\ndet(I + BG). And det(I + BG) = det(I + GB), so since\nevery column of B sums to zero, the parts of G that are\nindependent of the column index also make no contribution to the probability. The last three terms of Eq. (26)\nall depend either only on the row index, or only on the\ncolumn index. So a dissipative defect has no effect on any\nweakly allowed cluster probabilities (either on one-point\nprobabilities or on correlations).\n\n\f10\nAs a special case, this means that the unit height probability, and its correlations, are unaffected by closed or\nbulk dissipative defects. However, the higher height variables are affected. Using the Green function in Eq. (26),\nand the methods described in section IV, we find that\nalong a closed boundary, with a defect at the origin, we\nhave the following height probabilites at x1 :\n\nfc (1) = 0\n1\n+ ...\nfc (2) = \u2212\n2\u03c0x21\n1\nfc (3) = +\n+ ...\n2\u03c0x21\n\n(27)\n(28)\n(29)\n\nWe have numerically confirmed these results. These results provide further evidence that the height two and\nthree variables have different field identifications along\nclosed boundaries.\nSince the height two and three variables have dimension two, this indicates that a dissipative defect along a\nclosed boundary is a dimension zero operator. Consistent with this, uniform dissipation in the bulk has been\nidentified with the integral of the dimension zero operator \u03b8\u03b8\u0304 [15]. However, the correlation of \u03b8\u03b8\u0304 with the\nheight two and three operators in Eqs. (21-22) does not\nproduce the correlations in Eqs. (27-29); this situation\nrequires further analysis.\nIn the bulk, we would also expect that the higher\nheight probabilites would be affected by a defect site,\nand have confirmed this with numerical simulations, although have not proven this analytically.\nThe fact that weakly allowed cluster variables have no\ncorrelations with bulk or closed defects provides compelling evidence that weakly allowed cluster variables do\nnot provide a complete picture of the sandpile model.\nThis has particular bearing on the analysis of Mahieu\nand Ruelle [15]. They studied specific bulk correlations\nof the simplest weakly allowed cluster variables, and developed a complete field picture for these variables. They\nfound that (at the critical point) these variables are all\nlinear combinations of three dimension two variables,\n \u0304 \u03b8\u0304, \u2202\u03b8\u2202 \u03b8\u0304, and \u2202\u03b8\n \u0304 \u2202 \u0304\u03b8\u0304, strongly indicating that all\n\u2202\u03b8\u2202 \u0304\u03b8\u0304+ \u2202\u03b8\u2202\nweakly allowed cluster variables are linear combinations\nof these three fields. However, this analysis left the status\nof the height two variable unresolved. Mahieu and Ruelle\npointed out that since the height two variable appears in\na number of the weakly allowed cluster variables, it might\nbe expected that the height two variable would also be a\nlinear combination of these three fields, or more specifically, proportional to the sole rotationally invariant field,\n \u0304 \u03b8\u0304 [15]. But they also noted that such an iden\u2202\u03b8\u2202 \u0304\u03b8\u0304 + \u2202\u03b8\u2202\ntification appeared inconsistent with the fusion rules of\nthe c = \u22122 CFT, which would indicate a different field\nidentification. The analysis here points strongly to the\nlatter conclusion, although the specific field identification\nin the bulk remains unresolved.\n\nIX.\n\nALL n-POINT CORRELATIONS ALONG\nOPEN BOUNDARIES, PART I\n\nWe have calculated all n-point correlations of all four\nheight variables, along open boundaries, in the presence\nof an arbitrary number of dissipative defects. We begin\nby discussing why this case is so tractable (in contrast to\nthe closed case, where we have been unable to calculate\nthe three-point function of the height two variable).\nThe heights of the correlation function are placed at\nx1 , x2 , * * * , xn , and defining xab \u2261 xa \u2212xb \u2261 cab x, we work\nin the limit x \u2192 \u221e, where the cab 's are kept constant.\nAs discussed in section V, and appendices A and B,\na number of anomalous terms arise in the computation\nof correlation functions. While the discussion in these\nsections focused on closed boundary correlations, similar\nanomalous graphs arise in open boundary correlations.\nHowever, it turns out that these anomalous graphs produce no contributions to the universal parts of any correlation functions, greatly simplifying matters. We prove\nthis claim in this section, and in the next section look at\nthe actual calculation of the correlation functions.\nWe start by focusing on the two-point correlations.\nNote that the anomalous graphs found thus far, in figure 3 and 4, all involve \"nearly-closed\" loops: the trees\nhave paths that go from the neighborhood of ~i to the\nneighborhood of ~j, and from the neighborhood of ~j to\nthe neighborhood of ~i. The paths do not actually form\nclosed loops, since no closed loops are allowed in spanning\ntrees, but they do come very close (within one site). The\nreasons for this are general, so similar structures will arise\nin all anomalous graphs, for all correlation functions. For\nexample, the anomalous graphs in figure 4 arose because\na long, nearly-closed loop from one site could not be reversed in direction, if it passed through fixed arrows at\nthe other site (see figure 10 of appendix B).\nIn the open case, these anomalous graphs between ~i\nand ~j always fall off faster than O(1/x4 ). This is in\ncontrast to the closed boundary case, where such diagrams diverge-see Eqs. (6-8). The difference results\nfrom the Green functions. While the Green function\ndiverges as ln(x) along closed boundaries, it decays as\n1/x2 along open boundaries (see appendix C). Using\nPriezzhev's method, the matrix determinant for evaluating any closed loop diagrams necessarily involves two\nGreen functions, one from ~i to ~j, and another from ~j\nto ~i, giving an overall factor of 1/x4 . Furthermore, calculating the diagrams requires two matrix determinants,\nwhich come with leading terms equal in magnitude, but\nopposite in sign-see figure 6. The O(1/x4 ) parts of the\nclosed loop diagrams thus cancel along open boundaries.\nSo the anomalous graphs for the two-point functions automatically fall off faster than O(1/x4 ), and do not need\nto be considered when calculating leading-order, universal parts of correlation functions.\nBy this logic, for any n-point open boundary correlations, any anomalous graphs must have terms that decay\nas 1/(xa \u2212 xb )p , where p \u2265 5, for some a, b \u2208 1, 2, * * * n.\n\n\f11\nAside from the sites at xa and xb , there are (n \u2212 2) other\nsites that need to appear in the connected correlation\nfunction. Each brings a new Green function, of O(1/x2 ),\nso the overall contribution of any anomalous graph must\ndecay at least as fast as O(1/x5+2(n\u22122) ) = O(1/x2n+1 ).\nBut we will see in the next section that all n-point correlations decay to leading order as 1/x2n . So the anomalous graphs have no effect on the universal parts of any\nn-point correlation functions. The conjecture at the end\nof section V has thus been proven for all open boundary\ncorrelations.\nX.\n\nALL n-POINT CORRELATIONS ALONG\nOPEN BOUNDARIES, PART II\n\nSince we can ignore the anomalous graphs for open\nboundary correlation functions, no error is introduced\nby writing the height probability at each site as a linear\ncombination of local arrow diagrams, independently using at each site the linear relationships derived for the\none-point functions. Defining the open boundary correlation fop analogously to fc for the closed case (Eq. (12)),\nwe then have\nfop (a1 , a2 , . . . , an ) =\n\ndet(I + BG) = \u2212pu1 pu2 Trace\n\n\u001a\n\n=\n\nN\nloc N\nloc\nX\nX\n\nu1 =1 u2 =1\n\n...\n\nN\nloc\nX\n\nDa1 u1 Da2 u2 . . . Dan un\n\nun =1\n\nhLop,u1 (x1 )Lop,u2 (x2 ) . . . Lop,un (xn )i (30)\nEach Lop,uf (xf ) represents a local arrow diagram at xf ,\nanalogous to the diagrams in figure 2, but for the open\ncase, and Nloc is the total number of possible local arrow diagrams at a single site (see [16] for the list of diagrams). D is a constant matrix expressing height probabilities in terms of local arrow diagrams, for one-point\nfunctions, and was (implicitly) found in [16]. Each correlation of local arrow diagrams can now be calculated\nwith the Majumdar-Dhar method.\nIf a site ~i has local arrow constraints u, we express\nthose constraints by a matrix Bu , and let Guu be the\nGreen function matrix for the sites around ~i. Bu and Guu\nare both associated only with sites in the vicinity of ~i.\npu = det(I + Bu Guu ) gives the one-point probability for\nthe local arrow diagram Lop,u . The two-point correlation\nof local arrow diagrams u1 and u2 is given by det(I+BG),\nwhere B is block diagonal, with Bu1 and Bu2 along the\nblock diagonal, and G is made of the four matrix blocks\nGu1 u1 , Gu1 u2 , Gu2 u1 , and Gu2 u2 . Mahieu and Ruelle\nfound that the leading order contribution to the bulk twopoint probability is given by [15]\n\nI\nI + Bu1 Gu1 u1\n\nBu1 Gu1 u2\n\nI\nI + Bu2 Gu2 u2\n\nBu2 Gu2 u1\n\n\u001b\n\n(31)\n\nSimilarly, they found that the bulk, leading-order, contribution to the three-point probability is given by\ndet(I + BG) =\npu1 pu2 pu3 Trace\n\n\u001a\n\npu1 pu2 pu3 Trace\n\n\u001a\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n\u001b\n\nBu1 Gu1 u2\nBu2 Gu2 u3\nBu3 Gu3 u1 +\nI + Bu1 Gu1 u1\nI + Bu2 Gu2 u2\nI + Bu3 Gu3 u3\n\u001b\nI\nI\nI\nBu1 Gu1 u3\nBu3 Gu3 u2\nBu2 Gu2 u1\nI + Bu1 Gu1 u1\nI + Bu3 Gu3 u3\nI + Bu2 Gu2 u2\n(32)\n\n(Eqs. (31-32) are written in a different form than the\nexpressions in [15], but are equivalent.)\nThe derivation in [15] of Eq. (31) in the bulk relied\non the fact that the leading-order contribution to the\ntwo-point function comes from the pieces of det(I + BG)\nwith two terms off the block diagonal (i.e. one term from\nGu1 u2 , and one term from Gu2 u1 ). Similarly, the derivation of Eq. (32) was based on the fact that the leadingorder, connected, contribution to the three-point function comes from the terms of det(I + BG) with three\nterms off the block diagonal.\nThe trace formulae can be extended for all higher-\n\norder correlations for the open case. We will see that the\nleading-order contribution to the open boundary n-point\nfunction decays as O(1/x2n ). The open boundary Green\nfunction (appendix C) between (x1 , y1 ) and (x2 , y2 ) is\nGop,0 (x1 , y1 ; x2 , y2 ) =\n\n(y1 + 1)(y2 + 1)\n+ ...\n\u03c0(x1 \u2212 x2 )2\n\n(33)\n\nHere, x labels distance along the boundary, and y labels\ndistance from the boundary (the boundary is at y = 0).\nSince the Green function decays as 1/x2 , we can only\nhave n terms off the block diagonal. Furthermore, to get\n\n\f12\na connected correlation function, we must have exactly\none term off the block diagonal in every block row and in\nevery block column. This allows us to generalize Eqs. (3132) for open boundary n-point functions; they generalize\nin the obvious manner, with (n \u2212 1)! trace terms for the\nn-point function, corresponding to the (n \u2212 1)! ways that\nwe can loop through the n positions.\nEq. (33) shows that each off-diagonal block, Guv , factorizes into the product of a column vector and row vector:\n1\nhu hT ,\n\u03c0(xf \u2212 xg )2 f ug\n\nGuf ug =\n\n(34)\n\nwhere huf is a column vector of heights y + 1 of the sites\naround xf in Lop,uf (xf )-i.e. the pth entry of huf is the\nvalue of y + 1 for the pth site of Lop,uf (xf ). Substituting\nthis in the generalization of Eqs. (31-32), and using the\ncyclicity of the trace, each of the (n \u2212 1)! matrix traces\nbecomes a product of n 1 \u00d7 1 matrices. Furthermore,\nthe (n \u2212 1)! traces differ from each other only in the\n1/(xf \u2212 xg )2 terms chosen. The leading-order, connected\npart of the correlation function of n local arrow diagrams\nis then found to be\nhLop,u1 (x1 )Lop,u2 (x2 ) . . . Lop,un (xn )i =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nn\nY\n=\uf8ed\nkuf \uf8f8 det M (35)\nf =1\n\nM is defined as the n \u00d7 n matrix\nMf g \u2261\n\n\u001a\n\n0\nif f = g\n1/(xf \u2212 xg )2 if f 6= g\n\npa,op is the probability for a site along an open boundary\nto have height a, and the Ka are normalization factors.\nWe then, finally, have\nh\u03c6a1 (x1 )\u03c6a2 (x2 ) . . . \u03c6an (xn )i = det(M)\n\nFor n = 2, this reproduces the open boundary one- and\ntwo-point functions found in [16].\ndet(M) is the same as the n-point function of \u22122\u2202\u03b8\u2202 \u03b8\u0304,\nso up to rescaling factors (\u22122Ka 's), all four height variables are represented by \u2202\u03b8\u2202 \u03b8\u0304 along open boundaries.\nThis is rather surprising, given that we have seen that\nthe height variables are represented by different operators\nalong closed boundaries (Eqs. (20-22)). In CFT's, boundary operators are derived from OPE's of bulk operators-\nso the fact that the height operators are different along\nclosed boundaries proves that they must be different in\nthe bulk, but apparently these different bulk operators\nbecome identical along open boundaries.\nWe nowhere used the fact that these were the local\narrow diagrams associated with the height variables. So,\nin fact, we have shown that all local arrow diagrams along\nopen boundaries are represented by \u2202\u03b8\u2202 \u03b8\u0304.\nWe have also found the correlation function of n unit\nheight variables along closed boundaries. This requires\nlocal arrow constraints at 3n vertices of the ASM, and\nthus the calculation of a 3n-dimensional matrix determinant. The matrix is divided into 3 by 3 block submatrices, such that the diagonal blocks are all identical, and\nthe off-diagonal blocks all have the same form. A rotation\nmakes the matrix diagonal in 2 out of every 3 rows (and\ncolumns).

(25).

(44) is Eq. (40) with n = 2). In\nfact, we find that \u03c65;k acts like \u03c61 , \u03c62 , \u03c63 , and \u03c64 in\nall higher-order correlation functions, containing multiple\nheight variables and multiple dissipative defects.\nSuppose we are calculating a correlation function with\nn height variables, and m dissipative defects. The dissipative defects are at d~w = (xw , yw ), and have strength\nkw , 1 \u2264 w \u2264 m. As with the height locations, the xw\ncoordinates of the defects all scale with the same factor\nx, where x \u2192 \u221e. The change in the toppling matrix ,\n\u03b4\u2206 \u2261 \u2206 \u2212 \u22060 , is\n\u03b4\u2206~i,~j =\n\n\u001a\n\nkw if ~i = ~j = ~dw ,\n0 otherwise\n\n1\u2264w\u2264m\n\n(45)\n\nThe Green function is modified from its defect-free value,\nGop,0 , to\nI\nGop,0\nI\n=\n=\n\u2206\n\u22060 + \u03b4\u2206\nI + (\u03b4\u2206)Gop,0\n\u221e\nX\np\n=\nGop,0 (\u2212(\u03b4\u2206)Gop,0 )\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nG =\n\n(46)\n\np=0\n\nG(~i, ~j) can be represented as a trip from ~i to ~j, where\nalong the trip, the traveller can visit any of the defect\nsites as often as he or she wishes, each time picking up a\nfactor of \u2212(\u03b4\u2206)Gop,0 .\nWe have already seen that the defect-free correlation\nfunction of n height variables has a leading term of\nO(1/x2n ). If we instead use the Green function with defects, each trip to a defect introduces a factor of 1/x2 (see\nEq. (33)). In a connected function, we should visit each\ndefect at least once; in the leading term, each defect will\nbe visited from a distant site exactly once, and the correlation function will have a leading term of O(1/x2(n+m) ).\nAfter visiting d~w , we may travel repeatedly from d~w\nto d~w without picking up extra factors of 1/x2 . This\nproduces a contribution to Eq. (46) of\n\u221e\nX\np=0\n\n(\u2212kw G0 (d~w , d~w ))p =\n\n1\n1 + kw G0 (d~w , d~w )\n\n(We already saw this factor for a single dissipative defect,\nin Eq. (25).) Furthermore, inspection of Eq. (33) shows\nthat the visit to the defect at d~w from another site will\nresult in a factor of kw (yw + 1)2 /\u03c0. With Eq. (47), this\nmotivates the normalization factor in Eq. (43).\nEq. (43) normalizes the correlation function of n height\nvariables and m defects. To see that the form of the correlation function is still det(M), expand the determinant\nout into cycles. The connected part of the determinant\nin Eq. (40) is a sum of closed cycles of length n, where\neach cycle visits each of the positions (xf , 0) exactly once,\nand picks up a factor of 1/(xf \u2212 xg )2 when it travels from\nxf to xg . After normalizing, the defects have exactly the\nsame effect as the height variables-each trip to (or from)\na defect results in a 1/x2 term from the Green function\nto (or from) the defect (Eq. (33)).\nSo, in the end, the correlation function of n height\nvariables on the boundary and m defect sites near or\non the boundary, is given by the (m + n) dimensional\nmatrix determinant, det(M) (with appropriate normalization factors). This shows that dissipative defect sites\nalong or near open boundaries are, like the height variables, represented by \u2202\u03b8\u2202 \u03b8\u0304.\nNote that a dissipative defect has a much larger effect along a closed boundary than along an open one.\nA defect is represented by a dimension zero operator\nalong a closed boundary, but by a dimension two operator along an open boundary. This makes sense; along\nopen boundaries, grains are already dissipated by topplings, so adding a little more dissipation has only minor\neffects, compared to dissipation on a closed boundary.\n\n(47)\n\nAfter the bulk of this work was completed, we were\ninformed of independent, then unpublished, calculations\nof Eqs. (17-19), in the massive case, by G. Piroux and\nP. Ruelle [27]. Discussions with G. Piroux and P. Ruelle\nthen led us to the field identifications in Eqs. (21-22),\nand they further corrected an error we had made in these\nsame equations. This work was supported by Southern\nIllinois University Edwardsville. We thank V. Gurarie\nand E. V. Ivashkevich for useful discussions.\n\nAPPENDIX A: ANOMALOUS GRAPHS IN\nBOUNDARY TWO-POINT\nCORRELATIONS-PART I\n\nIn this section we discuss what we call anomalous\ngraphs of the first kind, which arise when converting from\nASM height probabilities to spanning tree probabilities.\nAs stated in section V, it would be natural to expect,\nbased on analogy with the one-point height probabilities, for the two-point height probabilities to be given\nby Eq.

We focus on the\nclosed two-point correlations; other cases are similar.\nFor correlations between ~i and ~j, Ivashkevich divided\nthe states of the ASM into sets Skl , consisting of states\nallowed when h~i \u2265 k and h~j \u2265 l, but forbidden otherwise [16]. However, not all ASM states fall into one\nof these sets. There are states that are allowed when\n(h~i , h~j ) = (1, 2), and when (h~i , h~j ) = (2, 1), but forbidden when (h~i , h~j ) = (1, 1); these states do not belong to\nany set Skl . One such state is shown in figure 7.\nWe find it convenient to define S\u0303kl , consisting of ASM\nheight configurations on the sandpile, excluding ~i and ~j,\nthat are allowed when we add (h~i , h~j ) = (k, l), but both\nforbidden when we add (h~i , h~j ) = (k \u2212 1, l), and also\nforbidden when we add (h~i , h~j ) = (k, l \u2212 1). Note that\nwhen counting states, the fact that we do not specify the\nheights of ~i and ~j introduces a multiplicative factor; for\nexample, | S\u030312 |=| S12 | /(3 \u2217 2) for ~i and ~j both on a\nclosed boundary. Now, every state must be in at least\none of the sets S\u0303kl , but some states are in several S\u0303kl 's.\nFor example, the state in figure 7 is in both S\u030312 and S\u030321 .\nNo anomalous graphs arise for two-point correlations\ninvolving at least one unit height variable, since in those\n\ncases the relevant S\u0303-sets do not intersect. The number\nof states where ~i has height one and ~j has height h is\nPh\np=1 | S\u03031p |. Furthermore, the representation of S\u03031h\nis exactly what we would expect; it corresponds to the\nnumber of spanning trees where NNP~i = 0, and NNP~j =\nh \u2212 1. So no anomalous graphs arise when the two-point\ncorrelation has at least one unit height variable.\nThings get more complicated when both heights are\nhigher heights. We discuss in detail the 2-2 (height twoheight two) correlation along a closed boundary; the analysis for the other two-point correlations is similar.\nIf ~i and ~j both have height two, we must be in at least\none S\u0303kl , for k \u2264 2, l \u2264 2. S\u030312 and S\u030321 intersect, so\nnumber of 2-2 states is\n\u0010\n\u0011\n| S\u030311 | + | S\u030312 | + | S\u030321 | + | S\u030322 | \u2212 | S\u030312 \u2229 S\u030321 |\n\n(A1)\nThe first three terms all have the \"natural\" spanning tree representation. The difficulty is in evaluating | S\u030322 | \u2212 | S\u030312 \u2229 S\u030321 |. S\u030322 counts states where\n(h~i , h~j ) = (2, 2) is allowed, but neither (h~i , h~j ) = (1, 2)\nnor (h~i , h~j ) = (2, 1) are allowed. In figure 8, we have\nstarted with a large rectangle, representing the the set of\nstates where (h~i , h~j ) = (2, 2) is allowed, and (h~i , h~j ) =\n(1, 1) is forbidden-we call this set X. In the rectangle are two subsets, corresponding to regions where\n(h~i , h~j ) = (1, 2) is allowed, and where (h~i , h~j ) = (2, 1) is\nallowed-we call these two sets X1 and X2 . In this Venn\ndiagram, S\u030322 is the diagonally shaded region outside the\ncircles, and S\u030312 \u2229 S\u030321 is the cross-hatched intersection of\nthe two circles. Looking at the Venn diagram, we see\nthat to find | S\u030322 | \u2212 | S\u030312 \u2229 S\u030321 |, we start with the set\nX, and then subtract off the states in X1 and X2 independently. By independently we mean that states in the\nintersection of X1 and X2 get subtracted off twice. So\n\n| S\u030322 | \u2212 | S\u030312 \u2229 S\u030321 |=| X | \u2212 | X1 | \u2212 | X2 |\n\n(A2)\n\nFor states in X, setting (h~i , h~j ) = (1, 1) produces an\nMFSC. (Note that we have defined the MFSC as the\nmaximal FSC produced when the heights at both ~i and\n~j are simultaneously set to one; if only one height was\nset to one, then the largest FSC might be smaller, or\nthere might be no FSC at all.) The set X can be partitioned into the following disjoint subsets, depending on\nthe shape of the MFSC:\n\nXA : The MFSC consists of disjoint subsets around ~i and ~j\nXB : The MFSC is connected, with \u2265 2 neighbors of ~i and exactly 1 neighbor of ~j\nXC : The MFSC is connected, with \u2265 2 neighbors of ~j and exactly 1 neighbor of ~i\n\n\f15\nXD : The MFSC is connected, with exactly 1 neighbor of ~i and exactly 1 neighbor of ~j\n\nX1 and X2 can be partitioned into analogously defined\nsubsets, X1A , X1B , etc. . . So, for example, X1D is the\nsubset of XD such that (h~i , h~j ) = (1, 2) is allowed. (Note\nthat X1C = \u2205 and X2B = \u2205.) We want\n\n*\n\ni2\nj1\n\ni1 ?\nX\n\n(| Xk | \u2212 | X1k | \u2212 | X2k |)\n\n(A3)\n\nOur \"naive\" guess would be that this would equal the set\nof states where NNP~i = NNP~j = 1. We carefully count\nthe states, comparing with this guess.\nXA , after subtracting off the states from X1A and X2A ,\nis equal to one-fourth the number of spanning trees for\nwhich ~i and ~j each have one NNP, and {~i}\u222aTree~i does not\nborder or intersect {~j} \u222a Tree~j . (The one-fourth comes\nfrom the fact that the spanning tree arrows from ~i and\n~j can point out from the MFSC in any direction.) Tree~\ni\nrefers to the set of sites that are predecessors of i. The\ncondition that {~i} \u222a Tree~i and {~j} \u222a Tree~j cannot border each other comes from the condition that the MFSC\nconsist of disjoint subsets around ~i and ~j.\nWe now consider XB . The MFSC generated when\n(h~i , h~j ) = (1, 1) must still be an MFSC when (h~i , h~j ) =\n(2, 1). So (h~i , h~j ) = (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 1) produces an MFSC\nthat includes exactly one neighbor of ~j, the site ~i, and\nat least two of ~i's neighbors. Just as in section III, this\nis equivalent to a modified ASM, where bonds along the\nborder of the MFSC are removed (except for one bond\nof ~j). In Eq. (A3), X2B = \u2205, but we do need to subtract\noff states in X1B . To do this we only count the states of\nXB such that (h~i , h~j ) = (1, 2) is forbidden, which implies\nthat h~i = 2 \u2192 1 should produce a new, smaller FSC,\ncompletely contained within the larger MFSC. We then\nsee that | XB | \u2212 | X1B | \u2212 | X2B | corresponds to onefourth of all spanning trees where NNP~i = NNP~j = 1,\nand either ~i \u2208 Tree~j or ~i borders Tree~j , with one exception. The exception occurs because the MFSC, by\nconstruction of XB , can only have one neighbor of ~j.\nSo | XB | \u2212 | X1B | \u2212 | X2B | will not count cases\nwhere NNP~i = NNP~j = 1, ~i borders Tree~j , and ~j borders Tree~i -this case is shown in figure 3. We label this\nset of graphs as c. Since c has NNP~i = NNP~j = 1, it\nwould be natural to expect it to appear in the spanning\ntrees contributing to the height two-height two correlation function. However, since no MFSC's of X have two\nneighbors of ~i and two neighbors of ~j, graph c does not\nappear in XC or XD either.\nThe analysis for XC is identical to that for XB , and\n| XC | \u2212 | X1C | \u2212 | X2C | counts one-fourth the spanning trees where NNP~i = NNP~j = 1, and either ~j \u2208 Tree~i\nor ~j borders Tree~i , except that, again, the spanning trees\nof c are excluded.\n\nj\n\ni\n\nk\u2208{A,B,C,D}\n\nFIG. 9: Correlations where \u03b21 6= \u03b22\n\nIn XD , the MFSC has only one neighbor of ~i and one\nneighbor of ~j. The one-to-one mapping between XD and\nspanning tree states posessess some subtleties, but the\nend result is what one would expect: The number of\nstates in | XD | \u2212 | X1D | \u2212 | X2D | is one-fourth the\nnumber of spanning trees where NNP~i = NNP~j = 1, and\nTree~ and Tree~ border each other, but ~i \u2208\n/ Tree~, and\ni\n\nj\n\nj\n\n~j \u2208\n/ Tree~i .\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nIn the end, we see that 4 | S\u030322 | \u2212 | S\u030312 \u2229 S\u030321 | is\nequal to the number of spanning trees where NNP~i =\nNNP~j = 1, except for the set c, which contains all spanning trees where both ~i borders Tree~j , and ~j borders\nTree~i . c consists of the anomalous graphs of the first\nkind.\nAn similar analysis for other closed correlation functions shows that the spanning trees in c contribute to the\nheight two-height three correlation, and get subtracted\nfrom the height three-height correlation (relative to a\n\"naive\" approach). These changes are necessary for the\nheight probabilities to all sum to one, so this provides\na check on our mapping between ASM states and spanning tree states. In the next appendix, we consider yet\nanother complication that arises in the calculation of the\ntwo-point functions.\n\nAPPENDIX B: ANOMALOUS GRAPHS IN\nBOUNDARY TWO-POINT\nCORRELATIONS-PART II\n\nWe saw in the previous appendix that Eq. (5) does\nnot quite hold, but is only off by the anomalous graph\nc. So except for this complication, the two-point height\ncorrelations can be turned into linear combinations of\nprobabilities for spanning trees with nonlocal conditions\non NNP~i and NNP~j . As in the previous appendix, we discuss only the closed boundary two-point functions; other\ncases are similar.\nAs discussed in section IV, we can write the probability\nNh to have NNP~i = h \u2212 1 as a linear combination of\nnonlocal arrow diagrams, which we can then rewrite as\n\n\f16\n\n1\n\n&\n\n=>\n\n1\n\na term\n\na term\n\n1\n\n&\n\n2=>\n\na term\n\nb term\n\nFIG. 10: Correlations where \u03c61 6= \u03c62\n\nfollows (see figures 1 and 2):\nN2 = 2(\u03b21 + \u03b22 + \u03b3)\n= 2(\u2212Lc,1 + 3Lc,2 + Lc,3 ) +\n4(\u03b21 \u2212 \u03b22 ) + 2(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 )\nN3 = 2(\u03c61 + \u03c62 + \u01eb) + \u03b4\n= 2(2Lc,1 \u2212 2Lc,2 + Lc,5 ) + Lc,4 \u2212\n4(\u03b21 \u2212 \u03b22 ) \u2212 2(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 )\n\n(B1)\n\n(B2)\n\nThese relationships hold regardless of the correlation\nfunctions that ~i are in.

If the long path of \u03c61 avoids arrow\nrestrictions at other sites, the long path can be reversed,\nand \u03c61 will be equivalent to \u03c62 . However, if the long\npath goes through arrow restrictions at other sites of the\ncorrelation function, then \u03c61 will not be equivalent to \u03c62 .\nFigure 10 compares diagrams that arise in (\u03c61 , \u03c61 ) correlations, with diagrams that arise in (\u03c62 , \u03c62 ) correlations.\nThree of the four diagrams shown (labeled with \"a\"'s)\nare equivalent, but the fourth one (labeled with \"b\") is\nnot. The resultant anomalous graphs of the second kind\nwere shown and discussed earlier, in section V (see figure 4). When all the correlations of the (\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 )'s in\nEqs. (B1-B2) are considered, we find the following for\n\nIt would be simplest if in correlations of N2 and N3 ,\nwe could replace N2 and N3 with LN 2 and LN 3 , since\nlocal correlation functions are easily calclated. As in the\nprevious appendix, we call this approach \"naive,\"-this\nnaive approach does not quite work, and we call the deviations of the correct answers from the naive approach\n\"anomalous graphs of the second kind.\"\nWe no longer have \u03b21 = \u03b22 and \u03c61 = \u03c62 in correlations\nof N2 and N3 , because in correlations between distant\nsites ~i and ~j, switching arrows at ~i can affect predecessor relationships at ~j. To analyze the (\u03b21 \u2212 \u03b22 ) terms\nin Eqs. (B1-B2), consider the configuration in figure 9,\nwhere we have not specified the direction of the arrow\nfrom ~i. If the arrow from ~i points to ~i1 , then ~j1 is not\na predecessor of ~j, so the configuration at ~j is \u03b3. And if\nthe arrow from ~i points to ~i2 , then ~j1 is a predecessor of\n~j, so the configuration at ~j is \u03c62 . So switching from \u03b21 to\n\u03b22 at ~i can affect whether the configuration at ~j is \u03c62 or\n\u03b3. However, this inequivalence between \u03b21 and \u03b22 turns\nout to have no effect on any correlation functions, to any\norder, since \u03c62 and \u03b3 always appear in the combination\n\u03c62 + \u03b3, in LN 2 and LN 3 , and \u03c62 + \u03b3 has no correlations\nwith \u03b21 \u2212 \u03b22 .\n\nclosed boundary correlations:\n\nhN2 (r)N2 (0)i = hLN 2 (r)LN 2 (0)i + 4(a \u2212 b) (B5)\nhN2 (r)N3 (0)i = hLN 2 (r)LN 3 (0)i \u2212 4(a \u2212 b) (B6)\nhN3 (r)N3 (0)i = hLN 3 (r)LN 3 (0)i + 4(a \u2212 b) (B7)\nThe correlations involving the height one variable are unaffected by these complications.\nTo summarize, naively transforming from nonlocal arrow diagrams to local arrow diagrams independently at\nevery site of a two-point correlation results in anomalous\ngraphs a and b.\n\n\f17\nAPPENDIX C: GREEN FUNCTIONS\n\nGop,0 (x1 , y1 ; x2 , y2 ) = G0 (x1 \u2212 x2 , y1 \u2212 y2 ) \u2212\nG0 (x1 \u2212 x2 , y1 + y2 + 2) (C3)\n\nThe inverse of the bulk toppling matrix \u22060 is the lattice Green function, which has long been known [24].

While the theory has a simple underlying Gaussian\nstructure, it still possesses a number of subtle features.\nWe use the formulation of the c = \u22122 CFT where the\naction is given by\n1\nS=\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u2202\u03b8 \u2202 \u0304\u03b8\u0304\n\n(E1)\n\n\u2202 and \u2202 \u0304 refer to the holomorphic and antiholomorphic\nderivatives-that is, the derivatives with respect to z =\nx + iy and z\u0304 = x \u2212 iy. \u03b8 and \u03b8\u0304 are anticommuting Grassmanian variables. The action has zero modes, which\nmake the partition function zero. If we normalize the\naction by not integrating over the zero modes, we get\nWick contraction rules, with each contraction between\n\u03b8(z1 ) and \u03b8\u0304(z2 ) giving a factor of \u2212 log(z1 \u2212 z2 ).\nWhile boundary conformal field theories are generally\nwell understood [19, 28], boundary logarithmic conformal field theories possess a number of subtleties that\nare not well understood. Results on boundary LCFT\nare still to some degree contradictory [29\u201334]. However, basic results from non-logarithmic boundary CFT\n\n[1] P. Bak, C. Tang, and K. Wiesenfeld, Phys. Rev. Lett.,\n59, 381 (1987).\n\nshould still be expected to apply. In particular, just as\nfor non-logarithmic boundary CFT's, as bulk operators\nare moved near a boundary, their antiholomorphic pieces\nshould behave like holomorphic pieces at mirror locations\nacross the boundary [19, 30].\nAPPENDIX F: A PROOF THAT THE HEIGHT\nVARIABLES HAVE DIFFERENT BULK FIELD\nIDENTIFICATIONS\n\nThe correlation functions in Eqs. (13-15), Eqs. (17-19),\nand Eqs. (27-29) show conclusively that the three height\nvariables are represented by different operators along\nclosed boundaries. As already discussed, since boundary operators are derived from OPE's of bulk operators,\nthis proves that the height variables must be represented\nby different operators in the bulk as well [19]. However,\nit is worth noting that this conclusion can be reached\nwith a simple argument, based on general principles of\nconformal field theory, without doing any detailed calculations.\nSuppose that all four height variables were represented\n(up to multiplicative factors) by the same field operator.\nThe unit height variable is known, from its two-point\ncorrelation, to have dimension two [14], so, by our assumption, all four height variables would have scaling dimension two. The height probabilities get modified from\ntheir bulk values, pB,h (h = 1, 2, 3, 4) near a boundary\n(closed or open). Then one-point functions of operators\nof dimension d will decay as 1/y d , where y is the distance from the boundary, and d is the operator dimension [28, 30].\n\nph (y) = pB,h +\n\nch\n+ ... ,\ny2\n\n(F1)\n\nfor some constants ch . If the fields are normalized (to\nhave zero expectation value and coeficient -1 in two-point\ncorrelations), then general CFT principles predict that\nthe coefficients of the 1/y 2 terms should be universal\nnumbers, depending only on the field and the boundary\ncondition [28]; in particular, they should be independent\nof h. So upon normalizing the height variables, the different ch should all become c\u0303, a number independent of\nh. Since we are assuming that all four height variables\nare represented by the same field, the 1-1, 2-2, 3-3, and\n4-4 correlations should all have the same sign (negative),\nso this normalization should not change the signs of the\ncoefficients, and all theP\nch 's should have the same sign as\n4\nc\u0303. However, we need h=1 ch = 0, for the four height\nprobabilites to sum to one, so the ch cannot all have the\nsame sign. By contradiction, the four height variables\nmust be represented by different fields in the bulk.\n\n[2] J. M. Carlson and J. S. Langer, Phys. Rev. Lett. 62, 2632\n\n\f19\n(1989).\n[3] P.
