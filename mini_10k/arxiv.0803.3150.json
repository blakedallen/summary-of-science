Each member\nappears as an inflexible, or as a non-contrarian or contrarian floater. An inflexible\nadheres to its opinion, whereas a floater may change into a floater of the alternative\nopinion. The occurrence of this change is governed by the local majority rule: members\nmeet in groups of a fixed size, and a floater changes provided its opinion has the\nminority in its group. A non-contrarian floater keeps the opinion it adopts under\nthe local majority rule, whereas a contrarian floater adopts the alternative opinion.\nWe determine the dynamics generated by repeated opinion changes, and study its\ndependence on the densities of inflexibles and the frequencies of contrarians among the\nfloaters. We restrict ourselves to groups of size at most 3.\n\nKeywords: Sociomathematics, sociophysics, opinions dynamics, local majority rule, contrarian behaviour, floating behaviour\nNOTE concerning the current version of the text: due to the large sizes of some\nfigures, the accompanying captions to these figures do not fit together with the\nfigures on the same page. Therefore, these captions are placed in the main text,\ninstead of in the sequence of Figures at the end of the text.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nWithin the growing field of sociophysics (see [1] for the defining paper, and [3]-[6] for an\nimpression of the recent state of the art), two- and three states Galam opinion models and\ntheir modifications ([3], [6]) play a guiding role in analyzing the process of opinion spreading\nin communities. These models are centered around the local majority rule (l.m.r.), which\nis applied either in a deterministic or a probabilistic way. In the basic deterministic case,\nsupporters of the (two or three) opinions present in a community are randomly distributed\nover all possible groups of a fixed size. Within each group the members adopt the opinion\nthat has the majority in that group, after which all group members are recollected again.\nIn case there is no majority in a group, its members stick to their own opinion (i.e., neutral\n3\n\n\ftreatment; the probabilistic treatment in case of a tie assigns opinions to the group members according to a certain probability distribution). Repeated application of this principle\ngenerates what is called randomly localized dynamics with a local majority rule ([6]). In the\nbasic probabilistic case, the community members are divided among groups of various sizes\naccording to some probability distribution, and within each group all members adopt one of\nthe possible opinions with a certain probability.\nIn the basic deterministic two states opinion model, fast dynamics occurs in which the\nopinion that originally has the majority eventually will obtain complete presence at the cost\nof the alternative opinion. In the probabilistic two states opinion model, the final outcome\ndepends on the probability distributions for group sizes and local adaptation. Eventually\nthe state of the community can be either a polarization on the initial majority or minority,\nor a perfect consensus on both opinions (see [3], which unifies basic probabilistic two states\nopinion models). In [6] a three states opinion model is introduced in which the community\nmembers are randomly distributed over groups of size 3. Within each group the l.m.r. is\napplied, with the additional rule that in case of a tie all members of the group adopt one of\nthe three opinions according to some probability distribution. It is shown that the dynamics\nleads to fast polarization on one of the three opinions, which may be an opinion that initially\nhas a minor presence in the community.\nTo add more realism to opinion models, in [2] the basic deterministic two states Galam\nopinion model is extended by the introduction of so-called contrarians. A contrarian is a\ncommunity member who, instead of the opinion it should adopt under the l.m.r., switches\nto the alternative opinion. Depending on the density of contrarians as well as on group size,\ntheir presence either leads to a stabilization of the opinion dynamics in which one opinion (the\none with the lower density of contrarians) dominates the other, to an equilibrium in which\nneither opinion dominates (in case both opinions have equal densities of contrarians), or (in\ncase of relatively large densities of contrarians for both opinions) to a dynamics in which\nthe dominating opinion constantly alternates between the two opinions. The incorporation\nof contrarians in opinion dynamics models is a step towards an explanation of the \"hung\nelections\" outcome in several recent voting events (the U.S.A. presidential elections in 2000,\nthe German elections in 2002 and 2005, as well as the 2006 Italian elections, see [2], [5]), in\nwhich one strategy achieved only a very narrow gain at the cost of another strategy. The\n4\n\n\forigin of contrarian behaviour as well as its implications have been the focus of various other\nrecent studies, see [8], [11], [12], [13].\nIn a recent paper ([4]) the basic deterministic two states Galam model has been modified\nby introducing opinion supporters that express what in politics (and other games) is called\ninflexible behavior. An inflexible community member is a supporter that under all conditions\nsticks to its opinion. Under this terminology supporters that switch opinion when in the\nminority then classify as floaters, and we shall use this distinction in what follows. In [4]\nthe effect of inflexible behavior on opinion dynamics is studied for the case that opinion\nsupporters repeatedly meet in groups of fixed size 3. It is shown that a small density of\ninflexibles for only one of the two opinions allows for the existence of two local attractors.\nOne of these local attractors is a mixed one, on which both opinions are present and on which\nthe opinion that is supported by inflexibles is a minority. The other attractor is a single\nstate attractor, on which the opinion that is supported by inflexibles has complete majority,\ni.e., its density equals 1, the other opinion being absent. Due to the presence of these two\nattractors, the outcome of the opinion dynamics thus depends on the initial condition, the\nbasin of attraction for the mixed local attractor being relatively small compared to that for\nthe single state attractor. If the density of inflexibles is sufficiently large (approximately\n17%), the mixed attractor disappears and the single state attractor becomes global. In\ncase both opinions have small and equal densities of inflexibles there are two mixed local\nattractors. These two attractors are symmetrically situated with regard to a separator on\nwhich both opinions are present with density 0.5. A change in the density of inflexibles for\none of the opinions breaks this symmetry, and a sufficiently large increase may lead to a\nglobal attractor on which the opinion with the larger density of inflexibles has the majority,\nsee [4]. Recently, the effect of inflexibles and floaters on opinion dynamics has also been\nstudied in [9] and [10].\nIn this paper we combine the approaches presented in [2] and [4], by allowing for groups\ncomposed of inflexibles as well as contrarian and non-contrarian opinion supporters. For\nclarity we restrict ourselves to groups of fixed size at most 3. For both opinions we assume\nfixed densities for the inflexibles. Also, we consider the contrarians to be part of the floaters,\ni.e., in a given group the contrarians first determine their opinion according to the l.m.r., and\nsubsequently change to become a floater (not necessarily a contrarian) for the alternative\n5\n\n\fopinion (which thus may be the opinion that the contrarian initially was supporting). The\npresence of contrarians for each opinion is quantitatively expressed as a fixed fraction of the\ndensity of floaters of the respective opinion. In case of a tie in groups of size 2 we apply the\nneutral treatment. After an opinion update, all supporters for both opinions are recollected\nand then are redistributed again, either as an inflexible or as a non-contrarian or contrarian\nfloater, according to the fixed densities for inflexibles and the fixed fractions of contrarians\nfor the two opinions. We study qualitative characteristics of the opinion dynamics generated by repeated updates. In particular we study changes in the number of equilibria, and\nchanges from monotone to alternating dynamics, due to changes in parameter combinations.\nA detailed mathematical treatment of the generated opinion dynamics, for groups of arbitrary size, shall be given in a forthcoming paper ([7]).\nNotation\nWe denote the two opinions by A and B. The densities of inflexibles for the A and B opinion\nare denoted by \u03b1A and \u03b1B respectively, with 0 \u2264 \u03b1A \u2264 1 as well as 0 \u2264 \u03b1B \u2264 1, and in addi-\n\ntion 0 \u2264 \u03b1A + \u03b1B \u2264 1. Since the roles of the A and B opinion are interchangeable in deriving\nthe opinion dynamics, we may without loss of generality assume that 0 \u2264 \u03b1A \u2264 0.5, and we\nshall do so in what follows. The fraction of contrarians among the A floaters is denoted by\n\u03b3A , and \u03b3B denotes the fraction of contrarians among the B floaters, with both 0 \u2264 \u03b3A \u2264 1\nand 0 \u2264 \u03b3B \u2264 1. The size of the groups in which opinion supporters meet is denoted by L.\n\nThe density of the A opinion at time t = 0, 1, 2, * * * (or after t updates) shall be denoted as\npt . Note that for given \u03b1A and \u03b1B the density pt necessarily lies in the interval [\u03b1A , 1 \u2212 \u03b1B ]\n\n(independent of L, \u03b3A or \u03b3B ). With fL;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B we denote the function that determines\nthe density of the A opinion after application of the l.m.r. followed by the switch of the\ncontrarians. Thus, pt+1 = fL;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B (pt ). Setting \u03b3A = \u03b3B = 0, pt+1 = fL;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;0,0 (pt )\nthen gives the density obtained from pt when the l.m.r. is applied without being followed\nby the switch of the contrarians. In the Appendix tables are given, presenting all possible\ngroup compositions in terms of inflexibles and non-contrarian and contrarian floaters for\ngroup sizes L = 1 to 3, together with the effects of the l.m.r. and the opinion changes of\ncontrarians. It is assumed that the community is sufficiently large to allow for the derivation\nof the density of each possible group composition in the ensemble of all groups of a fixed size\n6\n\n\ffrom the densities in the community of the constituents of a group. From these tables the\nexpressions for fL;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B are obtained.\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nWith fL;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B we denote the dynamics generated by repeated application of fL;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B\nin subsequent timesteps. Furthermore, p\u0302L;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B denotes an asymptotically stable equi\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nlibrium for fL;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B , and p\u2217L;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B refers to an asymptotically stable periodic point.\nWe now turn to the treatment of the opinion dynamics for group sizes L = 1, 2 and 3.\n\n2\n\nL=1\n\nThe case L = 1 resembles a community in which each member is unaffected by other community members in determining its opinion, and the only changes in opinion come from the\ncontrarians. The contributions to the A density after application of the local majority rule\nis obtained from the second column in Table 1 in Appendix 6.1. This column obviously is\nequal to the first one, since in groups of size 1 local majority is automatically obtained, but\nis without effect on the opinion densities. These contributions are: \u03b1A for the A inflexibles,\nand p \u2212 \u03b1A for the (non-contrarian and contrarian) A floaters. Their sum is p, and we obtain\nthat\npt+1 = f1;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;0,0 (pt ) = pt ;\n\n(1)\n\nconsequently, each p \u2208 [\u03b1A , 1\u2212\u03b1B ] is a neutrally stable equilibrium for the opinion dynamics.\nIn case only (non-contrarian and contrarian) floaters are involved both \u03b1A and \u03b1B are equal\nto 0, and we restrict ourselves to the contributions from the second, third, fifth and sixth line\nin the table. Since the l.m.r. leaves each group of size 1 unaffected, a switch by a contrarian\nin this case necessarily implies a change to the opinion it initially does not support. Thus,\nhere also a contribution to the A density comes from the group that initially consists of only\nB contrarians, as these will turn into A floaters. In this case we obtain for the contribution\nto the A density:\n\u0010\n\u0011\npt+1 = f1;0,0;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B (pt ) = (1 \u2212 \u03b3A )pt + \u03b3B (1 \u2212 pt ) = \u03b3B + 1 \u2212 (\u03b3A + \u03b3B ) pt .\n\n(2)\n\nThe effect of both inflexibles and non-contrarian as well as contrarian floaters is obtained\nby adding all the expressions in the last column: the contributions \u03b1A due to the invariant\n\n7\n\n\fdensity of A inflexibles, (1 \u2212 \u03b3A )(pt \u2212 \u03b1A ) from the non-contrarian A floaters, and \u03b3B (1 \u2212\n\u03b1B \u2212 pt ) from the contrarian B floaters. This yields:\npt+1\n\n= f1;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B (pt )\n= \u03b1A + (1 \u2212 \u03b3A )(pt \u2212 \u03b1A ) + \u03b3B (1 \u2212 \u03b1B \u2212 pt )\n\n(3)\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n= \u03b1A \u03b3A + (1 \u2212 \u03b1B )\u03b3B + 1 \u2212 (\u03b3A + \u03b3B ) pt .\nIt follows that if \u03b3A + \u03b3B > 0, then\np\u0302 =\n\n\u03b1A \u03b3A + (1 \u2212 \u03b1B )\u03b3B\n\u03b3A + \u03b3B\n\n(4)\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nis the unique equilibrium for the opinion dynamics f1;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B . Due to its linearity as a\nfunction of pt , expression (3) implies that the dynamical characteristics of this equilibrium\nare governed solely by the frequencies of the contrarians. The equilibrium is asymptotically\nstable if and only if 0 < \u03b3A + \u03b3B < 2. For 0 < \u03b3A + \u03b3B < 1 the equilibrium is approached\nmonotonically, with an increase in the A density if and only if its initial value is less then\nthe equilibrium value. For \u03b3A + \u03b3B = 1, the function f1;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B is constant and equals\n\u03b1A \u03b3A + (1 \u2212 \u03b1B )\u03b3B ; the opinion dynamics then reaches its equilibrium in one iteration. For\n1 < \u03b3A + \u03b3B < 2, the equilibrium is approached alternately. For \u03b3A + \u03b3B = 2, i.e., both\n\u03b3A = 1 and \u03b3B = 1, the equilibrium equals 0.5(1 + \u03b1A \u2212 \u03b1B ) and is neutrally stable; each\n\np \u2208 [\u03b1A , 1 \u2212 \u03b1B ] different from 0.5(1 + \u03b1A \u2212 \u03b1B ) generates a neutrally stable cycle of length\n2.\nOn the equilibrium, the A opinion has the majority if and only if the inequality\n(0.5 \u2212 \u03b1A )\u03b3A < (0.5 \u2212 \u03b1B )\u03b3B\n\n(5)\n\nholds. Thus, for an opinion to achieve the majority it is required that it is being supported by\na sufficiently large density of inflexibles, and/or a sufficiently small frequency of contrarians\namong the floaters.\nGiven densities \u03b1A and \u03b1B of inflexibles for the two opinions, a change in the frequencies of\ncontrarians from 0 into small values \u03b3A and \u03b3B causes the bifurcation from a collection of\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nneutrally stable equilibria for f1;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;0,0 into a unique stable equilibrium for f1;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B .\n8\n\n\fThe opinion which has the majority on this equilibrium is determined by inequality (5).\nIn case \u03b1A = \u03b1B = \u03b1, the opinion with the smaller frequency of contrarians obtains the\nmajority. Conversely, given different frequencies \u03b3A and \u03b3B of contrarian floaters for the\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nB\ntwo opinions, in the absence of inflexibles the dynamics f1;0,0;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B has p\u0302 = \u03b3A\u03b3+\u03b3\nas its\nB\nunique stable equilibrium, on which the opinion with the smaller frequency of contrarians\nhas the majority. Fixing sufficiently small densities \u03b1A and \u03b1B of both opinions as inflexibles,\nthis equilibrium slightly shifts but leaves the majority unaltered. In case \u03b3A = \u03b3B , in the\nabsence of inflexibles the equilibrium p\u0302 equals 0.5, and the introduction of small densities of\ninflexibles for both opinions changes this equilibrium into one on which the opinion with the\nlarger density of inflexibles takes the majority. Figure 1 illustrates these conclusions.\n[Figure 1 about here.]\nFigure 2 gives a qualitative overview of the outcomes of the possible opinion dynamics\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nf1;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B .\n\n[Figure 2 about here.]\nFigure 2: An overview of the opinion dynamics of f1;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B , for values \u03b1A and \u03b1B as\nindicated, and with \u03b3A and \u03b3B in each pane on the horizontal and vertical axis, respectively,\nboth ranging between 0 and 1.

On the line\n\u03b3A + \u03b3B = 1 the function f1;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B is constant, and the corresponding values of \u03b3A\nand \u03b3B separate between monotone and alternating dynamics, with the monotone dynamics\noccurring if 0 < \u03b3A + \u03b3B < 1, i.e., below the line. The dashed line, if present, gives the\nvalues (\u03b31 , \u03b32 ) 6= (0, 0) for which the equilibrium of the opinion dynamics equals 0.5, and\nis determined by the expression (\u03b1A \u2212 0.5)\u03b3A \u2212 (\u03b1B \u2212 0.5)\u03b3B = 0.

The panes for values (\u03b1A , \u03b1B ) for which \u03b1A + \u03b1B = 1 represent\ndegenerate cases, in the sense that these values allow for only one density p\u0302 = \u03b1A for the A\nopinion to occur.\n\n9\n\n\f3\n\nL=2\n\nIn groups of size 2 the number of members that support the A or B opinion may be equal,\nin which case a tie occurs.

We obtain\npt+1 = f2;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;0,0 (pt ) = pt ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhich is obvious, since in groups of size 2 no majorities can occur, and, in case of a tie, the\nneutral application of the local majority rule does not have any effect.

We\ngive an overview.\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nSymmetry considerations imply that the dynamics f3;\u03b1,\u03b1;\u03b3,\u03b3 has p = 0.5 as an equilibrium,\nfor any choice of \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 0.5] and \u03b3 \u2208 [0, 1]. In addition to parameter combinations \u03b1 and \u03b3\nfor which this equilibrium is unique and stable, there are combinations which allow for an\nunstable repelling equilibrium p\u0302 = 0.5 in combination with two other, asymptotically stable,\nequilibria, or with two asymptotically stable periodic points of minimal period 2. Details for\nthese possibilities to appear are derived in Appendix 6.4, here we confine ourselves to the\noutcome.\nLet the critical curves c3 and C3 be defined as follows:\nc3 = {(\u03b1, \u03b3) \u2208 [0, 0.5] \u00d7 [0, 1] : (3 \u2212 4\u03b1)(1 \u2212 2\u03b3) = 2},\n\n(10)\n\nC3 = {(\u03b1, \u03b3) \u2208 [0, 0.5] \u00d7 [0, 1] : (3 \u2212 4\u03b1)(1 \u2212 2\u03b3) = \u22122}.\n\n(11)\n\nand\n\nFigure 4 shows the curves c3 and C3 in the (\u03b1, \u03b3)-parameter space. On c3 the derivative\n0\nf3;\u03b1,\u03b1;\u03b3,\u03b3\n(0.5) equals 1, whereas on C3 this derivative equals -1. The two corner areas in\n\nFigure 4 enclosed by either c3 or C3 are the regions of parameter combinations for which 0.5 is\nunstable; outside these regions (including the curves) 0.5 is the unique asymptotically stable\n11\n\n\f\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nequilibrium for f3;\u03b1,\u03b1;\u03b3,\u03b3 , independent of the initial condition. The lower left corner region is\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nthe area for which the dynamics f3;\u03b1,\u03b1;\u03b3,\u03b3 has two asymptotically stable equilibria p\u03023;\u03b1,\u03b1;\u03b3,\u03b3 .\nGiven parameter combinations (\u03b1, \u03b3) in this region, the opinion dynamics eventually will\nstabilize on an equilibrium on which the opinion with the initial majority will have maintained\nits majority. In case (\u03b1, \u03b3) 6= (0, 0), this equilibrium is mixed; if neither inflexibles nor\ncontrarians are present for both opinions, i.e. (\u03b1, \u03b3) = (0, 0), the equilibrium is a single state\nattractor with only one opinion present. These results generalize those obtained in [4] for\nthe case of equal densities of inflexibles and no contrarians for both opinions. For parameter\ncombinations in the upper left corner region in Figure 4, the dynamics has two attracting\nperiodic points of period 2. Here an initial majority does not guarantee the eventual majority,\nsince the dynamics is such that both opinions alternately switch between minority and\nmajority.\n[Figure 4 about here.]\nThus, if both opinions are being supported by equal densities \u03b1 of inflexibles and equal\nfractions \u03b3 of contrarians among the floaters, for an opinion to obtain the majority it is\nnecessary that \u03b1 as well as \u03b3 are sufficiently small, and that it has the initial majority.\nAlso, with increasing \u03b1 (\u03b3), the maximum value of \u03b3 (\u03b1) for which a majority is attainable\ndecreases. If no inflexibles are present, the fraction of contrarians among the floaters must\n100\nbe less than approximately 17% (\n%) for a majority to be realizable, and if the fraction\n6\nof contrarians among the floaters equals 0, the density of inflexibles must be less than 25%.\nIf in the parameter space a combination (\u03b1, \u03b3) approaches from within a corner towards\none of the two critical curves, then the two additional equilibria or periodic points approach\ntowards p = 0.5; a withdrawal in the parameter space results in the opposite movement\nof the additional equilibria or periodic points. It follows that when passing through c3 , the\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\ndynamics f3;\u03b1,\u03b1;\u03b3,\u03b3 undergoes a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation, and when passing through\nC3 the dynamics undergoes a period doubling bifurcation (flip bifurcation).\n\n4.2\n\nThe general case\n\nWe now return to the general expression (8) and give an overview of the possible outcomes\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nof the dynamics f3;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B . The analytical background is given in Appendix 6.5. We\n12\n\n\fdistinguish several cases.\n1. \u03b3A + \u03b3B = 1.\nFor \u03b3A and \u03b3B such that \u03b3A + \u03b3B = 1, the function f3;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B is quadratic in p.\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nThe corresponding opinion dynamics f3;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,1\u2212\u03b3A has a unique stable equilibrium\nin the interval [\u03b1A , 1 \u2212 \u03b1B ]. For (\u03b3A , \u03b3B ) = (0.5, 0.5), the function f3;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;0.5,0.5 be-\n\ncomes constant and equals f3;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;0.5,0.5 (p) = 0.5(1 + \u03b1A \u2212 \u03b1B ); it allows for a unique\n\nstable equilibrium p\u0302 = 0.5(1 + \u03b1A \u2212 \u03b1B ), on which opinion A has the majority if and\nonly if \u03b1A > \u03b1B . The following two figures distinguish between parameter combinations \u03b1A , \u03b1B and \u03b3A for which the A opinion obtains either the majority or minority\nin equilibrium (Figure 5), and for which the equilibrium is approached monotonically\nor alternately (Figure 6). It follows that with increasing value of \u03b3A , the region of\nparameter combinations (\u03b1A , \u03b1B ) for which opinion A obtains the majority, decreases.\nIn addition, if \u03b3A \u2264 0.5, the A opinion can obtain the majority for any value of \u03b1A ,\nprovided that \u03b1B is sufficiently small; if \u03b3A > 0.5, \u03b1A must be sufficiently large and\n\u03b1B sufficiently small for an A majority to occur.\n\n[Figure 5 about here.]\n[Figure 6 about here.]\n2. \u03b3A + \u03b3B 6= 1.\n\nThe expression f3;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B (p) \u2212 p = 0 for determining the equilibria is\nf3;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B (p) \u2212 p\n\u0010\n\u0011\n= \u03b1A (1 \u2212 \u03b3A ) + (1 \u2212 \u03b1B )\u03b3B \u2212 1 + 2\u03b1A (1 \u2212 2\u03b3A ) \u2212 \u03b3A + \u03b3B p+\n\u0010\n\n3 + \u03b1A (1 \u2212 2\u03b3A ) \u2212 \u03b1B (1 \u2212 2\u03b3B ) \u2212 4\u03b3A \u2212 2\u03b3B\n\n\u0011\n\n(12)\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\np2 \u2212 2 1 \u2212 \u03b3A \u2212 \u03b3B p3\n\n= 0.\nThe number of solutions is determined by its discriminant, which is denoted by\nD(\u03b1A , \u03b1B ; \u03b3A , \u03b3B ). The expression for the discriminant is derived in Appendix 6.5;\n13\n\n\fhere we discuss its implications.\nFor parameter combinations (\u03b1A , \u03b1B ; \u03b3A , \u03b3B ) such that D(\u03b1A , \u03b1B ; \u03b3A , \u03b3B ) > 0, the\nequation f3;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B (p) \u2212 p = 0 has a unique real solution. If D(\u03b1A , \u03b1B ; \u03b3A , \u03b3B ) < 0,\nthere are three real solutions. However, these solutions do not necessarily have to belong to the interval [\u03b1A , 1 \u2212 \u03b1B ] (but if a solution lies in this interval, it clearly is an\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nequilibrium for the dynamics f3;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B ). If D(\u03b1A , \u03b1B ; \u03b3A , \u03b3B ) = 0 there are three\nreal solutions, of which at least two coincide; if this happens in the interval [\u03b1A , 1\u2212\u03b1B ],\nthe parameter combination is at a bifurcation point, discriminating between dynamics\nwith either a unique equilibrium or three equilibria. If at the bifurcation point exactly\ntwo of the three solutions coincide, the coinciding solutions form a semistable equilibrium.\nFigure 7 shows a collection of signplots for the discriminant, for values \u03b1A and \u03b1B as\nindicated, and with \u03b3A and \u03b3B for each signplot between 0 and 1.

Furthermore, in panes for which \u03b1A = \u03b1B\nholds, on the line \u03b3A = \u03b3B in the black regions (i.e., a negative discriminant) in white\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nthe points are indicated for which the equilibrium p\u0302 = 0.5 for f3;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B is unstable;\nother points on the lines \u03b3A = \u03b3B (for \u03b1A = \u03b1B ) indicate parameter combinations for\nwhich p\u0302 = 0.5 is stable (as follows from Figure 4).\nThe discriminant becomes singular for parameter combinations (\u03b1A , \u03b1B ; \u03b3A , \u03b3B ) with\n\u03b3A + \u03b3B = 1. In approaching such parameter combinations for which (\u03b3A , \u03b3B ) 6=\n(0.5, 0.5), the value of D(\u03b1A , \u03b1B ; \u03b3A , \u03b3B ) goes to \u2212\u221e. For (\u03b3A , \u03b3B ) = (0.5, 0.5), the\n\nlimit generically equals +\u221e when this point is approached from the region \u03b3A +\u03b3B < 1;\nthe limit equals \u2212\u221e in case it is approached from the other side, i.e., from the region\n\u03b3A + \u03b3B > 1. (In case (0.5, 0.5) is approached along the zero set of D(\u03b1A , \u03b1B ; \u03b3A , \u03b3B ),\ni.e., in each pane in Figures 7 and 14 along the boundary that distinguishes between\nthe white and black regions and touches with the line \u03b3A + \u03b3B = 1, the limit clearly\nequals 0.)\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nOur further discussion of the opinion dynamics f3;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B is based on Figures 7\nand 14. Instead of a detailed analytical treatment, we continue with a number of\ncharacteristic outcomes of the opinion dynamics.\nA first characteristic that draws attention in Figure 7 is the existence of a wedge-shaped\nregion of parameter combinations (\u03b1A , \u03b1B ; \u03b3A , \u03b3B ) with negative discriminant for sufficiently\nsmall values of all four parameters. For the cases with both \u03b1A = \u03b1B and \u03b3A = \u03b3B within this\nregion, we already found the existence of two attracting equilibria, symmetrically positioned\nwith respect to a third, unstable equilibrium 0.5. We therefore expect also to find a similar\npattern of three equilibria in [\u03b1A , 1 \u2212 \u03b1B ] for deviations from such symmetric cases within\nthe wedge-shaped region. In [4] it has been derived that this is indeed the case in the absence\nof contrarians, i.e., for parameter combinations for which \u03b3A = \u03b3B = 0, and for \u03b1A and \u03b1B\nsufficiently small. Figure 8, which shows a number of graphs of functions f3;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B for\nrelatively small values \u03b1A , \u03b1B , \u03b3A and \u03b3B , implies the same pattern: in case the determinant\nD(\u03b1A , \u03b1B ; \u03b3A , \u03b3B ) is negative, the opinion dynamics has two attracting equilibria that are\nseparated by an unstable one. The two attracting equilibria differ with respect to the opinion\n\n15\n\n\fby which they are dominated. By leaving the wedge-shaped area, a bifurcation in the opinion\ndynamics occurs on its boundary D(\u03b1A , \u03b1B ; \u03b3A , \u03b3B ) = 0. Generically, when moving from\ninside the wedge-shaped area towards this boundary, the unstable equilibrium and one of\nthe two stable equilibria move towards each other, and at the bifurcation point merge (thus\ncausing a supercritical saddle-node bifurcation). Once the boundary has been crossed, the\nregion of parameters with a positive discriminant is entered, and the dynamics is left with\none attracting equilibrium. On this equilibrium opinion A dominates if the upper part of\nthe boundary is crossed, i.e., when \u03b3B > \u03b3A ; opinion B has the majority when the righthand side of the boundary is passed, on which \u03b3A > \u03b3B holds. This is also illustrated\nin Figure 8. The occurrence of such a bifurcation may lead to a drastic change in the\noutcome of the opinion dynamics: whereas inside the wedge-shaped region the outcome of\nthe opinion dynamics depends on the initial condition, outside the wedge-shaped area the\nopinion dynamics will end on the unique equilibrium, independent of the initial condition.\nAt the bifurcation point at the endpoint of the sharp region of the wedge-shaped area a\nsupercritical pitchfork bifurcation occurs, in which the three equilibria merge together into\none attracting equilibrium.\n[Figure 8 about here.]\nFigure 8: Four panes of graphs of functions f3;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B for relatively small values \u03b1A , \u03b1B ,\n\u03b3A and \u03b3B , with (\u03b1A , \u03b1B ) as indicated below each pane. In each of the four panes, \u03b3A and\n\u03b3B satisfy \u03b3A + \u03b3B = 0.2. The color coding of the graphs is as follows: red corresponds\nto \u03b3A = 0, for green \u03b3A = 0.05, for blue \u03b3A = 0.1, for purple \u03b3A = 0.15, and for magenta\n\u03b3A = 0.2. I.e., in the corresponding panes in Figure 7 we traverse the line \u03b3A + \u03b3B = 0.2\nfrom its upper left point on the \u03b3A = 0 axis to its lower right point on the \u03b3B = 0 axis, thus\npassing through regions with positive, zero as well as negative discriminant. Above each\npane the densities for opinion A are presented, as obtained by the corresponding opinion\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\ndynamics f3;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B , with initial density p = 0.5.\nThe white regions in Figure 7 (and also in Figure 14) are formed by the parameter combinations for which the discriminant D(\u03b1A , \u03b1B ; \u03b3A , \u03b3B ) is positive. The corresponding opinion\ndynamics then have a unique equilibrium, which (for the parameter combinations in Fig16\n\n\fure 7) is approached monotonically. Figure 9 shows a number of graphs f3;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B for\nparameter combinations with a positive discriminant. The Figure indicates that for small\nvalues of \u03b3A and large values of \u03b3B opinion A dominates in equilibrium, and that the dominion shift towards the alternative opinion if the fraction of contrarians among the A floaters\nincreases and that among the B floaters decreases.\n[Figure 9 about here.]\nFor given parameters \u03b1A and \u03b1B , crossing the boundary of the white area in any direction\naway from the lower left corner leads to the occurrence of a saddle-node bifurcation, now\nhowever outside the domain [\u03b1A , 1 \u2212 \u03b1B ] of the functions f3;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B (maintaining an\nattracting equilibrium in the domain). Therefore in the black region thus entered, the opinion\ndynamics also is characterized by a unique attracting equilibrium. Proceeding towards the\nupper right corner, the line of parameter combinations (\u03b3A , \u03b3B ) satisfying \u03b3A + \u03b3B = 1 is\ncrossed. On this line the discriminant D(\u03b1A , \u03b1B ; \u03b3A , \u03b3B ) is singular, and the corresponding\nopinion dynamics have been analyzed in 4.2.1.\nIn the black area in the upper right corner, for equal and sufficiently small values \u03b1A =\n\u03b1B = \u03b1 and sufficiently large and equal values \u03b3A = \u03b3B = \u03b3 it has been derived earlier that\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nf\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B has a unique unstable equilibrium p\u0302 = 0.5, which causes the convergence of the\ndynamics towards an attracting periodic orbit of period 2. Neither of the two opinions then\nachieves the definite majority. The values \u03b1 and \u03b3 for which this occurs have been derived in\n4.1, and are represented in Figures 7 and 14 by white line segments in the upper right corners.\nFor these parameter combinations the discriminant of the equation f3;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B (p) \u2212 p = 0\nis negative and thus has three different solutions, of which two are situated outside the\ndomain [\u03b1A , 1 \u2212 \u03b1B ]. Continuity arguments imply that this behavior will be maintained for\nparameter combinations sufficiently close to these line segments. Figure 10 illustrates this.\nIf the parameter combinations are sufficiently far removed from these line segments but \u03b3A\nand \u03b3B are still relatively large (i.e., for given \u03b1A and \u03b1B , in the upper right corner), the\ndynamics will converge alternately to a unique equilibrium. I.e., by moving away from the\nmanifold determined by the constraints \u03b1A = \u03b1B and \u03b3A = \u03b3B with large values \u03b3A and \u03b3B ,\na flip bifurcation occurs in which the attracting periodic 2 orbit collapses to an attracting\n\n17\n\n\fequilibrium point. This is illustrated by Figure 11. On the attractor the dominion shifts\ntowards opinion B with increasing \u03b3A and decreasing \u03b3B .\n[Figure 10 about here.]\nFigure 10: Four panes of graphs of functions f3;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B for relatively small values \u03b1A and\n\u03b1B , and with \u03b3A and \u03b3B satisfying \u03b3A + \u03b3B = 1.8.

I.e., for given (\u03b1A , \u03b1B ), we traverse the line \u03b3A + \u03b3B = 1.8 from its upper left\npoint on the \u03b3B = 1 line to its lower right point on the \u03b3A = 1 line.

We\nconsider cases with (\u03b1A , \u03b1B ) = (0.1, 0.4) and with (\u03b1A , \u03b1B ) = (0.5, 0.3), i.e., a case with small\n\u03b1A and intermediate \u03b1B , and one with both \u03b1A and \u03b1B intermediate. The corresponding\ngraphs of f3;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B are represented in Figures 12 and 13, for several values of \u03b3A and \u03b3B .\nAll cases allow for a unique attracting equilibrium. High values of both \u03b3A and \u03b3B lead to\nalternating convergence. Furthermore, a decrease in the fraction of contrarians among the\nfloaters of an opinion increases the density of this opinion in equilibrium.\n18\n\n\f[Figure 12 about here.]\nFigure 12: The left column shows four panes of graphs of functions f3;0.1,0.4;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B , for different\ncombinations of \u03b3A and \u03b3B .

The distinctive patterns of opinion dynamics are not characterized by complete quantitative detail. Rather, the results intend to point to possible outcomes\n19\n\n\fof opinion dynamics. We conclude that various kinds of dynamics may occur. In case the\nlocal majority rule followed by the contrarian changes are applied for group sizes L = 1 or\n2, the opinion dynamics generically converges to a unique equilibrium. In case the sum of\nfractions of contrarians for the two opinions is larger than 2, the equilibrium generically is\napproached alternately, otherwise the dynamics generically shows a monotone approach. For\nan opinion to obtain the majority in equilibrium, it is required that this opinion is supported\nby a sufficiently large density of inflexibles in combination with a sufficiently small fraction\nof contrarians, as expressed by condition (5).\nGroup size L = 3 allows for additional outcomes for the opinion dynamics. For sufficiently\nsmall densities of inflexibles for both opinions, and in addition sufficiently small fractions of\ncontrarians among the floaters for the two opinions, the dynamics allows for two attracting\nequilibria, that differ in which opinion has the majority. The opinion that eventually will\nachieve the majority thus is determined by the initial condition, and an opinion that has\na fraction of contrarians that is sufficiently smaller than that of the alternative opinion,\nmay achieve the majority in equilibrium, although initially it may be present as a minority.\nFor small values of inflexibles in combination with sufficiently large fractions of contrarians\namong the floaters, the generated opinion dynamics causes alternating convergence to a period 2 stable orbit (Figure 10). An increase of the densities of inflexibles or a slight lowering\nof at least one of the fractions of contrarians causes the collapse of the attracting periodic orbit into an equilibrium, but maintains the alternating behavior (Figure 11). For a relatively\nlarge collection of parameter combinations the dynamics ends up on a unique attracting\nequilibrium, which is approached either monotonically or alternating (see e.g. Figures 6\nand 13). An increase in the fraction of contrarians among the floaters of an opinion leads to\na decrease of the density of that opinion in equilibrium. Thus, for an opinion to achieve the\nmajority in equilibrium, a small fraction of contrarians among its floaters is favorable.\nIn [2], the \"hung elections\" outcome in recent votings has been attributed to the interplay of\nnon-contrarian and contrarian floaters. Likewise, the present paper may shed a light on the\n(dis)appearance of alternating opinion dynamics. The recent wins by Barack Obama and\nHillary Clinton in two consecutive pre-elections for the Democratic presidential nomination\n2008 in the United States may point to the beginning of an alternating series of wins and\nlosses for both candidates. Whether or not this is the case remains to be seen at the moment\n20\n\n\fof writing, but if it does it may point to considerable fractions of contrarians among the\nfloaters on both sides, in the states that show alternating election outcomes. In case the\nalternating pattern converges to a stable period 2 cycle, the uncertainty who will win the\nnomination will linger on until the final decisive event. (Note that since the outcome of an\nelection in an alternating environment depends on the moment the election actually takes\nplace, it may happen that in subsequent state elections the same winner occurs. This is\nhowever no indication of sustained major support. Furthermore, in a sequence of alternating\nenvironments, a large number of subsequent wins for the same candidate seems unlikely.)\nIf however the alternating changes are converging to an equilibrium, one of the candidates\neventually will reach a decisive majority. Due to the sensitivity of politics for influences, a\nchange in parameter values may easily occur, either with respect to the densities of inflexibles or to the fractions of contrarians. This may result in a switch from the one alternating\npattern into the other one, or even into monotone convergence towards an equilibrium. Although our framework does not map unequivocally to real communities, we think it may\nhint at possible explanations of outcomes of opinion dynamics.\nIn forthcoming papers we plan to continue the study of opinion dynamics, by focusing on\ncommunities in which more than two opinions are being supported. Also mathematical\naspects of opinion dynamics for group sizes larger than 3 will be studied.\n\n21\n\n\f6\n\nAppendices\n\nSubsections 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 present tables for groups of sizes L = 1, 2 and 3 from which\nthe density of the A opinion is derived after application of the l.m.r. and the switch by the\ncontrarians, given an initial density p for the A opinion. Each table consists of four columns,\nof which the first four are separated by arrows. The first column gives the possible group\ncompositions in terms of inflexibles and non-contrarian and/or contrarian floaters, the second\ncolumn gives the effect of the application of the l.m.r. for the group compositions given in\nthe first column. An application is indicated by a horizontal arrow, whose first appearance\nin a table is indexed by \"l.m.r.\"; at other places in the tables this index is omitted. The\nthird column then gives the effect of the switches by the contrarians if applicable, where it\nis understood that a contrarian switches into a floater of the alternative opinion. The final\ncolumn gives the contributions of the effect of the l.m.r. and the presence of the contrarians to\nthe density of the A opinion, weighed with the probability of the original group composition\nin the ensemble of all possible groups of fixed size, given the densities \u03b1A and \u03b1B of the\ninflexibles for both opinions, the fractions \u03b3A and \u03b3B of contrarians among the floaters of\nthe A and B opinion, respectively, and the densities p \u2212 \u03b1A for the A floaters and 1 \u2212 \u03b1B \u2212 p\nfor the B floaters. The total sum of these contributions yields fL;\u03b1A ,\u03b1B ;\u03b3A ,\u03b3B (p).\nIn each table the following notation is being used:\nAi\nAf\nAnc\nAc\nAfnc\nAfc\n\ninflexible of the A

By changing the frequencies of\ncontrarians from (\u03b3A , \u03b3B ) = (0, 0) into (\u03b3A , \u03b3B ) = (0.075, 0.05), the collection of neutrally\nstable equilibria (the diagonal) bifurcates into a unique stable equilibrium p\u0302 = 0.44 on which\nthe B opinion has the majority. Figure b shows the diagonal together with the graph of\nf1;0,0;0.2,0.2 on [0, 1], and the graph of f1;0.15,0.175;0.2,0.2 on [0.15, 0.825], both as functions of p.\nThe dashed lines indicate the boundaries of the interval [0.15, 0.825].
