Using the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrograph on the Keck telescope, we obtained internal stellar\nkinematic information for 36 field galaxies in the Groth Strip-21 early-type and 15 disk galaxies. Their redshifts\nrange from 0.3\u20131.0, with a median redshift 0.8. The slope of the relation shows no difference compared with the\nlocal slope. However, there is significant evolution in the zero-point offset; an offset due to evolution in magnitude\nrequires a 2.4 magnitude luminosity brightening at z=1. We see little differences of the offset with bulge fraction,\nwhich is a good surrogate for galaxy type. Correcting for the luminosity evolution reduces the orthogonal scatter\nin the Fundamental Plane to 8%, consistent with the local scatter. This scatter is measured for our sample, and\ndoes not include results from other studies which may have different selection effects. The difference in the degree\nof evolution between our field sample and published cluster galaxies suggests a more recent formation epoch-\naround z = 1.5 for field galaxies compared to z > 2.0 for cluster galaxies. The magnitude difference implies that\nthe field early-type galaxies are about 2 Gyr younger than the cluster ellipticals using standard single-burst models.\nHowever, the same models imply a significant change in the rest-frame U \u2212 B color from then to present, which is\nnot seen in our sample. Continuous low-level star formation, however, would serve to explain the constant colors\nover this large magnitude change. A consistent model has 7% of the stellar mass created after the initial burst,\nusing an exponentially decaying star formation rate with an e-folding time of 5 Gyr.\npoints to a formation epoch for cluster ellipticals at z > 2.\nCluster galaxies likely represent one of the earliest populations to form; because they exist in high-density regions that\nrapidly condensed out of the initial mass fluctuations, we expect\nthem to show the oldest stellar populations. Galaxies in the field\nrequire longer timescales for their formation, and we might\ntherefore expect to see differences between field and cluster\ngalaxies in their Fundamental Plane properties. Comparison\nof the two samples provides a relative timescale for galaxy formation that depends on environment, which helps to constrain\ncosmological models. Our goal is to explore the properties of a\nwell defined sample of field galaxies. At redshifts around one,\nthe predicted age difference between field and cluster galaxies is around 3Gyr (Kauffmann 1996), which, for single-burst\nstellar populations, would translate into a one-magnitude difference in offset from the Fundamental Plane.\nThere are other groups measuring the properties of field ellipticals. Van Dokkum et al. (2001) present 18 galaxies out to\na redshift of 0.55 and find slightly more evolution in the field\ngalaxies compared to their cluster sample, but the small differences only imply a very modest formation age difference of 1\nGyr or less. Van Dokkum & Ellis (2003) extend this analysis\nwith field galaxies in the North Hubble Deep Field out to redshift of one, and also find very little difference between cluster\nand field galaxies. Treu et al. (2002) study the FP evolution\nfrom 30 field galaxies between redshifts 0.1 to 0.66 and find an\nevolution in the luminosity larger than what has been found for\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nAs we probe to higher redshifts, changes in the structural\nproperties of galaxies provide necessary information to understand their formation and evolution. The Fundamental Plane\n(FP) is one of the main correlations that reflect the internal\nstructure of early-type galaxies, and so has become a primary tool for studying galaxy evolution. Since the Fundamental Plane relates sizes, magnitudes, and velocity dispersions, changes in relative positions and the density distribution\nwithin the Fundamental Plane not only allow us to determine\nwhich evolutionary processes are dominant at early times, but\nalso provide important information as to the formation epoch.\nAll three properties may have evolutionary signatures: galaxies\nmay grow in size due to accretion, change their brightness due\nto the stellar population, and even alter their projected internal dispersions due to evolution in the orbital structure or mass\ngrowth. The most important evolutionary effect is likely the\nfading of galaxies as the stellar population ages; based on current formation times for stars in elliptical galaxies-generally\naccepted to be before z=2-we should then expect substantial\nfading from z=1 to the present. In fact, many groups measure\nvalues consistent with this picture: van Dokkum et al. (1998)\nfind almost one magnitude of evolution in the surface brightness for a cluster at z=0.83, while Bender et al. (1998), Kelson et al. (1997), and J\u00f8rgensen et al. (1999) find consistent\nnumbers for clusters at lower redshifts.

However, Koopmans & Treu (2002)\nprovide one galaxy at redshift 1.0 which has a magnitude offset\nin the FP consistent with the cluster galaxy offsets. Thus, there\nis no clear picture of the differences, if any, between cluster and\nfield ellipticals. One problem is that at redshifts less than 0.7,\nthe expected magnitude differences are small even for galaxies\nwith formation epochs separated by a few Gyr. The passive luminosity evolution for a galaxy is greatest when the galaxy is\nless than 2 Gyrs old, and the amount of evolution rapidly decreases after that. Thus, the magnitude difference going from\n\n4 to 7 Gyr is significantly less than that going from 1 to 4 Gyr.\nGiven the uncertainties and intrinsic scatter in FP studies, it is\nimperative to push the data to as high a redshift as possible to\nsee the differences. This paper presents results for 36 galaxies\nbetween 0.3 < z < 1.1, with a median redshift of 0.8.\nThe DEEP (Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe) team\nhas been obtaining high signal-to-noise, high resolution data for\na magnitude-limited sample of field galaxies in the Groth Survey Strip, taken under HST programs GTO 5090 (PI: Groth)\nand GTO 5109 (PI: Westphal). The goal is to study the morphological and kinematic state of galaxies at redshifts from 0.5\n\n\f3\nto 1.0. This project is a long-term endeavor, and initial results have provided an important increase in our understanding of disk galaxy formation and evolution (Vogt et al. 1996;\nSimard et al. 1999). In this paper, we present absorptionline kinematic results for galaxies in the DEEP sample. Over\nthe next few years, this sample will increase dramatically.\nThroughout this paper we use a cosmology of H0 = 70, \u03a9m = 0.3\nand \u03a9\u039b = 0.7.\n2. OBSERVATIONS AND REDUCTIONS\n\nThe photometric observations consist of HST V and I band\nimages, with exposure times of 2800s in F606W and 4400s\nin F814W. The full field contains 28 overlapping HST pointings located at approximately 1417+52, called the Groth Survey Strip. The area spans 50\u2032 by 2.5\u2032 . Simard et al. (2002) provide details for the reduction and photometry. The full dataset\nconsists of 7450 galaxies with structural parameters determined\nfrom a two-dimensional bulge+disk surface brightness model\n(Simard et al. 2002). The data in this paper span the full angular length of the Groth Strip, but the density of coverage is not\ncomplete.\nWe obtained spectroscopic observations over several years,\nfrom 1995 to 2000, on the Keck telescope using the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrograph, LRIS (Oke et al. 1995). Two\ngratings were used to obtain large wavelength coverage: a blue\nside, which ranges roughly from 4500 \u00c5 to 6500 \u00c5, and a red\nside, ranging from 6000 \u00c5 to 9500 \u00c5. The exact wavelength\nrange depends on the slit's position in the mask. For the blue\nside, the spectral scale is 0.84\u00c5 pix\u22121 , and for the red side it is\n1.2\u00c5 pix\u22121 . The spatial scale for both is 0.215\u2032\u2032 pix\u22121 . Both the\nslit width and the seeing are typically 1\u2032\u2032 .\nThe spectroscopic reduction follows a pipeline procedure described in Weiner et al. (2003). We combine all spectra for a\nparticular galaxy; in some cases we combined spectra taken as\nmuch as five years apart. Typically, the early-type galaxies appeared on several mask designs since we desired higher signalto-noise (S/N) for absorption-line dispersions. The number of\nindividual exposures ranges from two to fifteen, with total exposure times ranging from 35 to 310 minutes. Table 1 presents\nthe galaxy sample, along with the exposure times.\n2.1. Object Selection\nThere are three selection steps that determine the final sample. These are the galaxy identifications from the HST image,\nthe spectroscopic selection from that sample, and finally the selection of galaxies from the spectroscopic sample that go into\nthis analysis. The photometric selection of the galaxies is described in detail in Simard et al. (2002). For the analysis in\nthis paper, this selection effect is negligible since there are no\nphotometric biases down to I = 23.5, and our faintest galaxy\nis I = 22.3. The original spectroscopic sample consists of 648\ngalaxies. It is magnitude-limited with I < 23 as galaxy candidates. In order to provide dense spatial coverage of the GSS\nfields, we used many different mask designs per field. We have\nobtained spectra in 25 of the 28 GSS fields, but in each field\nthe completeness varies significantly. In some of the fields, we\nhave spectra for all I < 23 galaxies, while in others the fraction\nobserved is below 20%.\nThe selection criteria for the absorption-line studies depend\nonly on S/N and the presence of absorption-lines; we measure\ninternal absorption-line kinematics for all objects with adequate\nsignal-to-noise (> 5 per pixel), regardless of galaxy type. Since\n\nwe require absorption-lines, the sample consists of predominantly early-type galaxies. Im et al. (2002) identify early-type\ngalaxies from the DEEP sample based on structural parameters; 21 galaxies (58%) from our sample are classified as early\ntype galaxies in that paper. Im et al. (2002) provide a detailed\ndescription of the separation into early and late type galaxies. This separation relies primarily on bulge fraction (> 0.4),\nsmoothness and symmetry, but not color. We refer the reader\nto that work for more information on the classification system.\nThe remaining 15 galaxies in our sample (42%) are likely disk\ngalaxies, but we measure them anyway; their results will be\ndiscussed separately. Im et al. have an additional 22 galaxies\nwhich we do not include since they are either too faint or have\nabsorption lines that fall into unusable spectral regions due to\nstrong night sky emission. Koo et al. (2003) study bulge properties of the DEEP sample and include all of our galaxies. Figure 1 presents true color images for the whole sample. In the\nfollowing, we make a clear distinction between early-types and\ndisk-dominated systems, and we will discuss each separately.\nOf the three selection effects-the original photometric sample selection, spectroscopic selection, and absorption line selection effect-the ability to measure absorption lines causes the\nmost severe constraint. The photometric catalogue contains every galaxy observed with HST in the F814W and F606W filters\ndown to I814 =24 and V606 =25. Since our faintest galaxy in the\nFP sample is I = 22.3, the photometric selection causes no bias\n(for further description of the photometric selection function,\nsee Simard et al. 2002). Since our faintest galaxy is relatively\nbright compared to the total spectroscopic sample, the spectroscopic selection function also has little effect on the overall selection function. Koo et al. (2003) discuss the selection\nfunction for bulges (which include the galaxies in this sample)\nand find that the most important effect is the magnitude of the\nbulge; i.e., size, bulge-to-total ratio, and color have small effect\non the spectroscopic selection function at our magnitude limit\nof I = 22.3. Thus, by far, the most important selection effect is\nthe ability to measure dispersions from the absorption lines. We\nfind that this selection does not bias our results, as discussed in\n\u00a73.\n2.2. Photometric Properties\nFrom the HST V and I images, we fit a two-dimensional\ndisk/bulge model to obtain the structural parameters. The details of this fit are in Simard et al. (2002). Our galaxies span\na range of types; we place them on the Fundamental Plane by\nusing half-light properties instead of bulge-fit properties. All\nplots below use the half-light radii and surface brightness. We\ndiscuss the changes when using the bulge properties as well.\nLocal FP studies use pure R1/4 fits to estimate the total light\nand half-light radii. For the early-type galaxies in our sample,\nwe perform both disk/bulge and pure bulge fits. The two properties that go into the FP are the surface brightness and half-light\nradius. The root-mean-squared (RMS) difference in surface\nbrightness between the two fits is 0.4 magnitudes. However, the\nimportant property for the FP is the change in surface brightness\nrelative to the change in the half light radius. By plotting these\ntwo parameters on orthogonal axes we minimize the uncertainties due to different photometric models. Kelson et al. (2000a)\ndiscuss this effect in detail and find that various photometric\nfits have little effect on the FP, since differences are manifested\nby moving along the plane instead of perpendicular to it. For\nour sample, the RMS differences perpendicular to the FP using\n\n\f4\n\nF IG . 2.- Spectra for the sample of galaxies. In each panel, the noisy black line represents the spectral data; each galaxy has considerably more spectral coverage\nbut we show only the region used for the kinematic analysis. Dotted lines in the spectra indicate those regions that were excluded from the fitting due to night sky\ncontamination. The red line is the velocity profile convolved with the best-fit weighted averaged template, as shown in the upper-right corner.\n\nthe two methods is only 0.02 magnitudes. This small amount is\nlarger than most of our individual uncertainties, and thus is insignificant. Since the disk/bulge decomposition offer superior\nfits, we only use those results for our analysis.\nThe two-dimensional fitting provides structural parameters\ndefined along the major axis; thus, half-light radii are along\nthe semi-major axes of the galaxies. Local samples gener-\n\nally use parameters defined in circular annuli, or use geometric mean radii. In order to compare properly to local samples,\nwe must convert our major-axis radii and surface-brightnesses\nto those defined according to circular annuli. This conversion\nis particularly important for elongated objects and those galaxies which have disk/bulge components that are not at the same\nposition angle, since in the latter case, major-axis half-light\n\n\f5\n\nF IG . 2.- continued\n\nradii are not well defined, whereas circular aperture radii are.\nWe integrate the disk/bulge model in circular annuli to the radius that contains half of the light, setting the average effective\nsurface brightness, SBe , equal to Ltotal /2\u03c0 rh2 . The local samples for early-type galaxies come from J\u00f8rgensen et al. (1994),\nFaber et al. (1989), and Bernardi et al. (2003). These samples\nuse circular or geometric mean apertures. The difference between geometric mean and circular radii are insignificant for\n\nour purposes.\nWe calculate K-corrections using an analytical formula derived from local galaxy spectra. This estimate is discussed in\nthe Appendix. We have compared these corrections to those determined from the stellar population models of Bruzual & Charlot (1998) and find little difference. Since most of our galaxies\nare at redshifts between 0.7 to 1.0 and observed in V and I, the\nK-corrections do not vary much in terms of rest frame U \u2212 B\n\n\f6\n\nF IG . 2.- continued\n\ncolor; at z=0.8, the observed V \u2212 I translates well into U \u2212 B.\nTable 1 presents the basic data. It contains Groth ID (Col. 1),\nredshift (Col. 2), spectroscopic exposure time (Col. 3), bulge\nfraction in the I-band (Col. 4), apparent I total Vega magnitude\n(Col. 5), rest-frame absolute B magnitude (Col. 6), observed\nV \u2212 I (Col. 7), rest-frame U \u2212 B (Col. 8), I-band half-light radius in arcseconds and kpc (Cols. 9 and 10), average B-band\nsurface brightness inside of the half-light radius (Col. 11), ve-\n\nlocity dispersion (Col. 12), offset from Fundamental Plane in\nmagnitudes (Col. 13), photometric type from Im et al. (Col.\n14), and RA and DEC (Cols. 15 and 16). All rest-frame quantities use H0 = 70, \u03a9m = 0.3 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.7.\n2.3. Kinematic Properties\nWe use combined, spatially-integrated line profiles to measure the kinematics. In only a handful of cases are we able\n\n\f7\n\nF IG . 2.- continued\n\nto measure spatially resolved kinematics. The wavelength region used in the analysis varies dramatically due to the redshift\nrange of the galaxies and the placement of the spectra relative\nto the night-sky lines, which pose a particularly difficult problem for measuring absorption-line kinematics. Table 2 and Figure 2 present the wavelength region used for each galaxy. Locally, velocity dispersion estimates rely on the G-band region\n(\u03bb 4300), Mg triplet lines (\u03bb 5167,5173,5184), and the Ca II\n\ntriplet (\u03bb 8498,8542,8662). At redshifts greater than 0.7, the Gband and Mg lines are pushed into the night-sky forest, and the\nCa triplet goes into the infrared region. Since high-resolution\nmulti-object near-infrared spectrographs do not readily exist,\nwe are forced to rely on spectral regions where optical spectrographs are efficient, i.e., the H+K region. This region historically has not been used much for velocity dispersions since\nthe lines are intrinsically broadened and suffer from template\n\n\f8\n\nF IG . 2.- continued\n\nmismatch more than in other spectral regions. In addition, if\nthe spectrum contains a significant amount of A-stars, then the\nhigh stellar rotation in A-stars might complicate the interpretation of the measured dispersion. However, the recent study of\nKobulnicky & Gebhardt (2000) demonstrates that, with care in\nchoosing stellar templates, the H+K region can be used to measure the internal motions of the galaxy. Using a local sample\nof late-type galaxies, this study compared the 20% line widths\nmeasured from the H+K region with those from HI velocity\nmaps. To within 20% of the HI value, all galaxies in their sample compare favorably. The concordance was even better for the\nearlier-type galaxies; the mix of stellar populations in late-type\ngalaxies complicates the analysis, compared to the relatively\nuniform population in early-types. Because we are studying\nmainly early-type galaxies, our situation is promising. However, we still need to determine the template population carefully for each galaxy (see below).\nObtaining internal kinematic information requires a deconvolution of the observed galaxy spectrum with a representative\nset of template stellar spectra. Both the deconvolution process\nand the template library are significant issues. For deconvolution, we treat each spectrum using two different techniques:\na maximum-penalized likelihood (MPL) estimate that obtains\na non-parametric line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD),\nand a maximum likelihood estimate of the best-fit Gaussian\nLOSVD. Both estimates use a similar fitting procedure. The\nprograms proceed as follows: we choose an initial velocity profile, either in bins for MPL or an analytic Gaussian distribution. We convolve this profile with a weighted-averaged template (discussed below) and calculate the residuals to the galaxy\nspectrum. The program varies the velocity profile parameters-\nbin heights or Gaussian \u03c3's-and the template weights to provide the best match to the galaxy spectrum. The MPL tech-\n\nnique is similar to that used in Saha & Williams (1994) and\nMerritt (1997). However, the difference is due to the simultaneous fitting of the velocity profile and template weights. This\nfitting is essential since the template profiles vary greatly in the\nH+K region, reflecting the relative amount of old and youngstar light. In fact, due to the large variation among spectral\ntypes, the H+K region becomes an excellent probe for disentangling the spectral make-up from the internal kinematics. For\nthe parametric estimate, we also include a Gauss-Hermite polynomial fit (van der Marel & Franx 1993) using the first four\nparameters-h3 and h4 (similar to skewness and kurtosis)-in\naddition to the velocity centroid and dispersion. We find no significant differences between the Gaussian fits compared to the\nfits with additional moments, likely due to the low signal-tonoise in the spectra. We report only the results for the Gaussian\nfits.\nThe other important issue is the correct template. Ideally,\none observes the template library through the same set-up as the\ngalaxy data, as is generally done for local analysis. However,\nfor redshifted data, it is not possible to obtain individual stellar\nspectra covering the same rest-frame wavelengths and spectral\nsetup. We must use either synthetic spectra or spectra taken\nthrough other spectroscopic configurations, and transform these\nto our system. We use templates from two sources: the Coud\u00e9\nFeed Spectral Library at KPNO (Leitherer et al. 1996), and the\nstellar templates observed by Kobulnicky & Gebhardt (2000).\nThe KPNO library consists of 684 stars having a broad range\nof spectral types, with 1.8 \u00c5 FWHM resolution. We select a\nsubsample of 21 stars representing A main-sequence through K\ngiant stars. This subsample provides good overall type coverage without requiring an extensive number of stars. The study\nof Kobulnicky & Gebhardt uses only 12 stars-covering a similar spectral range, but has higher resolution of 1.2 \u00c5 FWHM.\n\n\f9\nTemplate and galaxy spectra are continuum-divided. The\ncontinuum division alleviates the need for accurate flux calibration. We use a local continuum for the estimate as opposed\nto a global n-parameter fit to the full spectrum. The continuum\nestimate relies on binned windows from which we measure a\nrobust mean (the biweight, see Beers, Flynn, & Gebhardt 1990)\nfrom the highest 1/3 of the points (in order to exclude absorption lines), and then interpolate between these mean values. We\nhave tried a variety of continuum estimates (in terms of number\nof local windows and number of points used in the local averaging) and find insignificant differences in the kinematic results.\nWe then transform each template to the resolution and redshift of each galaxy spectrum. The resolution depends on the\nindividual slitlet (variation in the milling of the mask can cause\nslight variations of the slit width and smoothness of cut) and\nalso on the wavelength (in particular, the ends of the wavelength\ncoverage have worse resolution); we measure the spectral resolution locally for each galaxy in order to perform a proper kinematic analysis. The night-sky lines provide the local resolution.\nAt red wavelengths, the numerous sky lines require multi-line\nfitting, with multi-line Gauss-Hermite fits on spectral windows\nof 50 \u00c5 each. The relative positions of the lines were determined from high signal-to-noise, high-resolution spectra (Osterbrock 1997). The fits produce the instrumental resolution\nat each wavelength interval, and we choose that resolution appropriate for the position of the usable features in the galaxy\nspectrum. For the blue wavelengths (4000-6000 \u00c5), there are\nonly a few night-sky lines, forcing us to use an average resolution for the entire range. The instrumental profile is well\nrepresented by a Gaussian distribution plus a slightly negative\ntail component. We make no correction for effects from either\nslit illumination or slit width; however, since the seeing is typically larger than our slits and the observed galaxy dispersions\nare larger than the instrumental width, these effects are minimal. Having determined the appropriate spectral resolution, we\nthen redshift the template and convolve to this resolution. Redshifting the template causes the spectral resolution to decrease\nby 1+z, and this must be included when calculating the convolution. We convolve using a Gauss-Hermite polynomial with\n\u03c3 2 = \u03c3g2 \u2212 (\u03c3t (1 + z))2 and h4 = \u22120.07. \u03c3g is the resolution for the\ngalaxy spectrum (measured from the sky lines), \u03c3t is that of the\ntemplates, either 0.9 \u00c5 for the KPNO library or 0.51 \u00c5 for the\nKobulnicky & Gebhardt sample, and h4 represent the negative\ntail of LRIS. Since the template sample is larger for the KPNO\nlibrary, we prefer those. However, for the most distant galaxies,\nthe spectral resolution for the KPNO sample is too low-due\nthe broadening from 1+z-and we are forced to use the better\nresolution Kobulnicky-Gebhardt sample. Table 2 and Figure 1\npresent the template library used for each galaxy. Alternatively,\nwe could broaden the galaxy spectrum slightly to match the redshifted KPNO templates; we prefer not to do this since many of\nthe galaxies have small velocity dispersions, and we want to\noptimize the signal. We have analyzed many of the galaxies using both template libraries and find no significant differences.\nFigure 2 shows the spectra for a sample of the galaxies, and the\nGauss-Hermite fit convolved with the template.\nA handful of galaxies contain both the H+K region and the\nG-band region. For these, we have measured the internal kinematics separately over those regions. Figure 3 plots the dispersion measured from G-band region (we used 4150\u00c5\u2013 4430\u00c5)\nversus H+K region (3850\u00c5\u2013 4150\u00c5). Good agreement is obtained, with dispersions derived from the H+K region on aver-\n\nage only 4(\u00b15)% smaller than the dispersion measured in th Gband. Furthermore, Figure 3 contains galaxies where the H+K\ndispersion estimate comes from the blue spectrum and the Gband estimate is from the red spectrum. The concordance of\nthe two implies that the relative calibration of the instrumental\nprofile is correct.\nWe use Monte Carlo simulations to measure the uncertainties\non the dispersions. For each realization, we generate a simulated galaxy spectrum based on the best-fit velocity profile and\nan estimate of the root-mean-square (RMS) of the initial fit. Table 2 presents the signal-to-noise per pixel for each of the galaxies. The initial galaxy spectrum comes from the best-fitting\ntemplate convolved with the measured LOSVD. This provides\na galaxy spectrum with essentially zero noise (the noise in the\ntemplate is insignificant), plotted as the red smooth line in Figure. 2. From that initial spectrum, we then generate 100 realizations and determine the velocity profile, and hence the velocity dispersion, each time. Each realization contains flux values\nat each wavelength position randomly chosen from a Gaussian\ndistribution, with the mean given by the initial galaxy spectrum\nand the standard deviation given by the RMS of the initial fit.\nThe 100 realizations of the velocity profiles provide a distribution of values from which we estimate the 68% confidence\nbands.\n\nF IG . 3.- The velocity dispersion in km s\u22121 measured from the H+K lines\nrelative to the G-band estimate.\n\nBesides the dispersion uncertainty, an important aspect of the\nsimulations is to determine the measured bias. Often, and especially in low S/N data, the measurement technique itself may\nbias the parameter value. The best way to study this is to examine the distribution of values in the Monte Carlo simulation.\nIn every case, the bias in the dispersion is much smaller than\nthe uncertainty and the average bias is zero. The Monte Carlo\nprocedure incorporates the major sources of uncertainty in this\nanalysis, namely, the broadened lines of the H+K region, the\nvariable template mix, and low S/N. Thus we are confident that\nour dispersion estimates are unbiased. Furthermore, we have\nrun all following analyses using a strict cut of better than 15%\naccuracy on the dispersion measurements. This cut leaves 14\n\n\f10\ngalaxies in the sample, and we find no differences in the results\nversus using the full sample.\nThe relative uncertainty for the velocity dispersion scales\nroughly linearly as the S/N. A S/N of 5 per pixel (the lowest\nin the sample) implies an uncertainty around 40% and a S/N of\n25 per pixel (the highest) implies an uncertainty around 5%.\nWe have one galaxy in common with a previous measurement. The quad-lens galaxy, 093_2470 (HST14176+522), has a\nmeasured dispersion of 230 \u00b1 14 km/s by Ohyama et al. (2002).\nOur measured value is 202 \u00b1 9, which is barely consistent with\nthe previous measurement. This galaxy spectrum has the highest signal-to-noise ratio in our whole sample, and thus the best\nmeasured dispersion. We have thoroughly checked systematic\nissues by changing the spectral fitting range (H+K only, G-band\nregion only, and full spectrum) and the used templates. We find\ndifferences consistent within our quoted uncertainty. Given that\nour spectrum has higher S/N than that of Ohyama et al., we\nchoose to use our measurement.\n2.4. Aperture Correction\nSince the velocity dispersion may vary with radius in galaxies, and since we are using spectra extracted from different\nphysical sizes, we must correct the velocity dispersion to a common radius. The local analysis of J\u00f8rgensen et al. (1994) corrects to an aperture of radius 3.4\u2032\u2032 at the Coma distance, and\nwe adopt that value. We determine the aperture correction for\neach galaxy individually using its brightness profile and redshift. However, the radial profile for the velocity dispersion is\nunknown, and we have to approximate this variation. We use\nthe local samples of Gonz\u00e1lez (1993) and Ziegler & Bender\n(1997) to determine a characteristic gradient in the dispersion\nprofile. Gonz\u00e1lez's data extend from r=0\u2013Re , while Ziegler &\nBender's data extend much further out to 3 Re . The variation\nseen inside Re is the same, namely, the variation is represented\nby a power-law with exponents ranging from \u20130.1 to 0. At\nradii beyond Re the profile becomes shallower, represented by\nlog (\u03c3) = \u22120.1(r/Re )0.75 (Ziegler & Bender 1997), but there is\na large variation of the slope. There appears to be no obvious trend between the dispersion profile with any other galaxy\nproperty, so we must use average values for our sample.\nThe radial extent of the extracted galaxy spectrum depends\non the half-light radius, the seeing disk, and the slit width. We\nuse an extraction window that is equal to the half-light radius\nconvolved with the seeing disk; this procedure optimizes the\nsignal while attempting to achieve similar extraction windows\nfor the full sample. The data contain galaxies with half-light\nradii that range from 0.1\u2032\u2032 to 1\u2032\u2032 , and the slit width and seeing are about an arcsecond; we then have extracted spectra that\ncontain galaxy light with aperture radii that vary from 1 to 5 Re .\nUsing this range of extraction radii and the above estimates for\nthe shape of the dispersion profile, we model each galaxy as\nan R1/4 surface-brightness profile to estimate the range of aperture corrections with circular apertures. Using Ziegler & Bender's \u03c3 profile, we find that the average dispersion correction\nis +10%, and a range of power-law exponents from 0 to \u20130.1\nyields corrections of 0% to +15%, respectively. Gebhardt et al.\n(2000) present dispersions inside various radii for a sample of\n13 nearby ellipticals. They also find no obvious trends amongst\ngalaxy properties; however, their data imply that the aperture\ndispersion variations are even smaller, with corrections ranging\nfrom \u201310% to +10% and averaging near zero. We compromise\nand increase all dispersion estimates by 10%.\n\n3. FUNDAMENTAL PLANE\n\nTable 1 includes the galaxy properties used in the Fundamental Plane. We report the measured velocity dispersion and\nnot the aperture corrected value; as mentioned above, the latter is obtained by increasing the first by 10%. The surface\nbrightness-using circular annuli-is in rest-frame B magnitudes (K-corrections are discussed in the Appendix). The following discussion in Section 3 and 4 is limited only to early\ntypes as classified by Im et al. (2002). Section 5 considers the\ndisk-dominated galaxies as well.\n3.1. Comparison with Local Samples\nFaber et al. (1989), J\u00f8rgensen et al. (1994), and\nBernardi et al. (2003) provide the local calibration for the Fundamental Plane. The Faber et al. sample is measured in the\nB-band, J\u00f8rgensen et al. use Gunn r-band, and Bernardi et al.\nuse the Sloan Gunn filters (g\u2217 , r\u2217 , i\u2217 , z\u2217 ). Since at z \u2248 1 the\nobserved V and I correspond to restframe U and B, the most\ndirect comparison is to B-band derived quantities. This is especially important since the slope of the plane may depend on\nband (e.g., Bernardi et al. find a linear trend of the slope with\nband; the slope increases slightly for redder bandpasses). Thus,\nwe utilize the B-band Fundamental Plane, as originally used in\nFaber et al.\nFigure 4 plots the edge-on view of the Fundamental Plane.\nTwo samples of nearby galaxies are shown: those from\nFaber et al. and J\u00f8rgensen et al. We do not include the galaxies\nfrom Bernardi et al. since they are not public. The two local\nsamples plotted in Figure 4 provide a consistency check. The\nmain differences are that the Faber et al. sample is a magnitudelimited sample of both field and cluster ellipticals, whereas J\u00f8rgensen et al. concentrate mainly on cluster galaxies and include\nmany S0s. Thus, the Faber sample has little bias in terms of\ndefining a \"typical\" local elliptical, while the J\u00f8rgensen sample includes fainter galaxies though not necessarily ellipticals.\nAlthough many objects are in common, we plot both local samples in full to show the distribution of values. We use an average\noffset to transform the Gunn r colors of J\u00f8rgensen et al. to the\nB magnitude system used by Faber et al. (B \u2212 r=1.25). As expected, since J\u00f8rgensen et al. go fainter, they tend to have more\nsmaller galaxies, whereas the Faber et al. sample is weighted\ntowards large ellipticals. Both samples provide a similar FP relation, with log (Re ) \u2248 1.25 log \u03c3 + 0.32 SBe \u2212 9.062, where we\nhave minimized the residuals in the orthogonal direction.\nBernardi et al. (2003) also measure a tight FP relation from\ntheir 8000 galaxies. Their slope is higher than the one used\nhere (1.49 compared to 1.25). Since the differences in the\nBernardi et al. slopes in their four bandpasses are small, the\nB-band FP slope derived from their data should not be much\nsmaller than 1.49. We have tested whether our results are affected by the choice of FP parameters, using a variety of slopes\n(from 1.1 to 1.6) and find little difference. The main reason for\nthis is that the large offsets in luminosity evolution that we see\nare much larger than the subtle differences caused by using a\ndifferent slope for the FP.\nWe divide the distant sample in Figure. 4 into low (z < 0.75)\nand high (z > 0.75) redshift. In both the low and high z datasets\nwe see a tight correlation in the FP. There is a trend for the more\ndistant galaxies to be further from the local relation, as expected\nfrom evolution. Figure 5 plots the offset in magnitudes from the\nlocal relation as a function of redshift. We assume for this plot\n\n\f11\n\nF IG . 4.- The Fundamental Plane for early-type galaxies. The red points represent field galaxies with redshifts greater than 0.75, and the blue points are those\nbelow 0.75. The small points represent the local sample, and the lines are linear fits to each sample, with black representing J\u00f8rgensen et al. (1994) and orange\nFaber et al. (1989). The solid points with error bars are the early-type galaxies and the open circles are disk-dominated galaxies. SBe is the average surface brightness\nwithin re in units of rest-frame B magnitudes. \u03c3's are aperture corrected. We use the fit of Bernardi et al. (2003) to measure the magnitude offset from the high-z\nsample.\n\nthat all of the evolution in the FP is due solely to stellar luminosity evolution. The solid black line in the plot is a cubic fit to\nthe data, forcing the local universe to have zero shift.\nIncluded in Fig. 5 are magnitude offsets for the individual\ngalaxies in the distant cluster MS1054-03 at z = 0.83 (blue\ndots). Our photometry has been run on the van Dokkum et al.\ngalaxies using the GIM2D software (Simard 2002) to make sure\nthat we are on the same system. The mean magnitude offset for\nthe cluster in Fig. 5 comes from van Dokkum et al. 1998, and\nthe individual points come from our re-analysis of their data.\nWe find no systematic offset. Furthermore, the two E+A galaxies in MS1054-03 lie along the same relation as we find for the\nfield galaxies at that redshift. Van Dokkum et al. concluded that\nthese two galaxies were recent acquisitions to the cluster, and\nthus are likely field galaxies. In addition, J\u00f8rgensen et al. (1999)\npresent detailed analysis of the evolution of the Fundamental\nPlane for cluster galaxies spanning 0 < z < 0.6. Figure 5 includes surface brightness offsets from these distant clusters. An\noffset between the two relationships clearly exists; field galaxies show significantly more brightening than cluster galaxies.\nThis result suggests that field galaxies have a more recent formation epoch than cluster galaxies.\nIm et al. (2002), using the early-type galaxy luminosity function at high redshift, find a significant brightening in L\u2217 for field\n\ngalaxies as well. The results presented here are consistent; in\nFig. 5 we include the two measurements from Im et al. (black\ncircles with error bars). We conclude that there is about a 1.6\nmagnitude brightening around z=0.8 and 2.4 around a redshift\nof 1. Other studies have found similar magnitude offsets. Cohen (2002), using the luminosity function, find approximately\ntwo magnitudes of brightening in their field samples at redshift\nnear 1. Koo et al. (2003), using a bulge sample, find an average\nluminosity brightening of 1.5 magnitudes in the redshift range\n0.72 < z < 1.1; if we use the same redshift interval, our average\noffset is 1.75 magnitudes. At redshifts below 0.4, Treu et al.\n(2002) and van Dokkum et al. (2001) find consistent results\nfrom their Fundamental Plane analyses that are consistent with\nour low-redshift sample.\n\n\f12\na smaller amount of luminosity evolution for them. This is not\nthe case in Fig. 6. If we divide the sample into two groups based\non S/N, the high-z galaxies with S/N< 10 have, on average, the\nsame amount of luminosity evolution as the galaxies with better\nS/N. We can also plot in Fig. 5 only the high S/N galaxies; the\nbest-fit trend with redshift found using high S/N galaxies is indistinguishable from the trend using the full sample. Thus, we\nare confident that the trend and scatter seen in Fig. 5 are real.\n\nF IG . 5.- Residuals from the local Fundamental Plane assuming that all\nevolution is due to stellar luminosity evolution. Filled green circles represent\nearly-type galaxies, and open green circles are disk galaxies. The blue squares\nare mean cluster values from the compilation in J\u00f8rgensen et al. (1999), and the\nblue circles are values for individual galaxies in the distant cluster MS1054-03\nat z = 0.83 (van Dokkum et al. 1998, see text). The black circles with error\nbars are mean field values reported in Im et al. (2002) using evolution in L\u2217 .\nThe solid black line is a cubic fit to the field points. The red line and blue\nlines are predicted offsets from stellar population models with formation times\nz f = 1.3 (for the field) and z f > 3 (for the clusters), respectively.\n\nAn obvious potential bias is whether the large magnitude\nbrightening results from a S/N limitation; i.e., the magnitude\nbrightening that we see could result if only bright galaxies\nmake it into the sample. However, this bias does not appear\nto be significant. First, we are considering magnitude offsets\nfrom the FP and not actual magnitudes. Thus, two galaxies\ncan have the same offset but have very different effective surface brightnesses; for the three galaxies near z = 1, their surface\nbrightnesses range by 3.5 magnitudes yet they all show nearly\nidentical magnitude brightening. Second, we do measure some\ngalaxies with much less brightening-in particular, 193_1227\nat z = 0.8-which demonstrates that any such galaxies in the\nsample are included. It appears that we are not measuring an\nouter envelope of a distribution but instead its actual extent.\nBernardi et al. (2003) estimate this bias in the SDSS sample using Monte Carlo simulations of their data. They find\nthat they have a 0.1 magnitude bias due to their magnitudelimited sample. The galaxies with the smallest magnitude offsets are not in their sample since they are too dim, and thus\nbiasing the fit to the magnitude offset for the full sample. Unfortunately our sample is not as uniform as the Bernardi et al.\nsample and we cannot easily simulate datasets that mimic our\nselection criteria (for a complete discussion of the selection criteria see Simard et al. 2003 for the photometric selection and\nWeiner et al. 2003 for the spectroscopic selection). For example, the galaxies in this sample have exposure times ranging\nfrom 35 to 310 minutes. As explained before, the selection criteria for the FP sample includes adequate S/N and appropriate\nspectral coverage that includes usable absorption lines. Thus,\nour best way to study potential biases is to examine correlations\nwith S/N. Figure 6 plots the S/N per \u00c5 for the full sample as a\nfunction of magnitude offset from the local FP. We break the\nsample into low-z (z < 0.7) and high-z (z > 0.7), since Fig. 5\nsuggests a strong trend with redshift. If we have a bias such\nthat only galaxies with large luminosity evolution make it into\nour sample, then as we include fainter galaxies we might expect\n\nF IG . 6.- Residual from the local Fundamental Plane versus the signal-tonoise (S/N) per \u00c5 of the spectrum. The open circles are those galaxies with\nz < 0.7 and the filled circles are those with z > 0.7. As seen in Fig. 5, the\nhigh-z objects have larger luminosity evolution. However, among the high-z\nsample there appears to be no trend with S/N.\n\n3.2. Comparison with Previous Work\nSeveral papers have measured FP offsets for field galaxies.\nThe most recent include van Dokkum & Ellis (2003), Treu et al.\n(2002), van Dokkum et al. (2001), and Koopmans & Treu\n(2002). In Figure 7, we repeat the points in Figure 5 but now include these four additional samples. Treu et al. (2002) study FP\nevolution from 30 field galaxies out to a redshift of 0.6. They\nprovide averages in five redshift bins, which we will use for\ncomparison. Van Dokkum et al. (2001) present 18 field galaxies out to a redshift of 0.55. They provide averages in three\nredshift bins. Van Dokkum & Ellis (2003) provide nine field\ngalaxies selected from the Hubble Deep Field out to redshift\n1.0. Koopmans & Treu (2002) provide one galaxy at redshift\n1.0.\nThe Treu et al. points fall along the offsets in our sample.\nThe van Dokkum et al. (2001) points follow a similar trend,\nbut with slightly less luminosity evolution. The van Dokkum\n& Ellis (2003) points are significantly different from our field\nsample, and quite similar to the cluster galaxy offsets. The single galaxy of Koopmans & Treu at z = 1 is more consistent with\nthe cluster galaxy offsets and the authors indeed suspect that\nthis galaxy may be in a proto-cluster. The most important aspect of this plot is that there are results from three independent\ngroups, using different observations and analyses. The agreement between our field sample and that of Treu et al. argues that\n\n\f13\nthere are no biases between our groups. The field galaxies of\nvan Dokkum et al. show less evolution but still more than the\ncluster galaxies. In fact, van Dokkum et al. report an offset between their cluster and field sample of 0.2 magnitudes. Using\ntheir median redshift bin of 0.46, we find an difference around\n0.3 magnitudes. While this difference is small, it translates into\na large difference at redshift of one. Thus, even though the\ncomparison between our sample and that of van Dokkum et al.\nappears to be insignificant, the consequences extrapolating to\nredshifts near one are important.\nIt is important to obtain larger samples of field galaxies below redshift 0.7. Bernardi et al. (2003) look for evolution in the\nFP using 9000 galaxies from Sloan out to redshift 0.26. They\nfind that after correcting for selection effects, the luminosity\nevolution is measured to be, at most, 0.1 magnitudes at z = 0.2.\nSince we have no data at z = 0.2, we cannot compare directly,\nbut this amount of evolution is consistent with the numbers that\nwe measure for higher redshifts.\n\npersion of 114 \u00b1 19 and we measure 111 \u00b1 10. At least for this\ngalaxy, both groups find a similar offset. Ironically, the offset\nfor this galaxy lies exactly in between the average offsets for\nour sample and van Dokkum & Ellis (2003). Thus, there are\nno obvious reasons for the differences from the analysis techniques. We conclude that the major difference is likely due\nto sample selection. In fact, van Dokkum & Franx (2001) argue that their FP sample is likely biased due to what they call\n\"progenitor bias\", causing their galaxies to not be a fair representation of galaxies today. The main effect of the \"progenitor\nbias\" would be to cause the observed FP magnitude offset to be\nless than it actually is since one would be looking at the reddest,\nmost evolved systems. Our selection criteria is mainly based on\nbulge fraction and therefore may be a more fair representation\nof local ellipticals. Two of the nine galaxies in van Dokkum\n& Ellis (2003) have similar magnitude offsets as we measure.\nIncluding the van Dokkum & Ellis objects with ours would substantially increase the intrinsic scatter of the FP. Clearly, studies with larger samples and well-defined selection effects are\nneeded.\n4. INTEGRATED COLOR DISTRIBUTIONS\n\nF IG . 7.- Comparison of our residuals with those from other sources. The\nsmall symbols are the same as in Fig. 5; solid triangles come from redshift\naverages of Treu et al. (2002), the open triangle from the single galaxy of\nKoopmans & Treu (2002) at z = 1. The filled black stars from redshift averages in van Dokkum et al. (2001), and the filled red stars are the individual\ngalaxies in van Dokkum & Ellis (2003). We have transformed all values to the\nsame cosmology of H0 = 70, \u03a9m = 0.3 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.7.\n\nFig. 7 shows that our distant field sample continues the trend\nseen in other, lower-redshift, field samples. The magnitude\nbrightening deduced from our sample is in agreement with the\nextrapolation from Treu et al. (2002). At redshifts below 0.6,\nthe agreement between our data and Treu et al. is excellent.\nThe field sample of van Dokkum et al. (2002) is not in as good\nagreement, but the differences are not large given the uncertainties.\nThe biggest difference is between our field sample and that\nof van Dokkum and Ellis (2003). We have excluded differences in the fitting techniques for both photometry and kinematics. For the photometry, we have run independent fits and\nfind very similar magnitude offsets; the mean difference between in magnitude offset between our photometry (Simard et\nal. 2002) and theirs (van Dokkum & Franx 1996) is consistent with zero, with a scatter smaller than 0.1 magnitudes. For\nthe kinematics, we have observed one galaxy in common with\nthe sample of van Dokkum & Ellis, using the same observational setup as our other galaxies. For this galaxy, HDFN_J\n123700.56 + 621234.7 at z = 0.562, they measure a velocity dis-\n\nColors provide additional insight into galaxy evolutionary\nhistory, since changes in the stellar population affect both total\nbrightness and color. However, it is difficult to compare colors\nof galaxies observed at different redshifts since all data must be\ntransformed to a common photometric system, requiring accurate spectral energy distributions (SED's) for all galaxy types.\nFurthermore, at redshifts beyond z = 0.8, the observed V represents rest-frame U magnitude, for which we do not have large\nlocal samples for comparison. Thus to use color information,\nthe two main obstacles are obtaining both accurate transformations to a local rest-frame color and an accurate local galaxy\ncolor distribution.\nAccurate color transformations are best determined using actual galaxy spectra. Spectral synthesis models do not reflect the\nwide variation seen in local galaxies, and specifically they do\nnot include dust effects. Since our observed bands are V and I\nat redshifts from 0.3 to 1, we must include UV, as well as optical, spectra for the local samples. In the Appendix we describe\nrest-frame color estimates and K-corrections.\nThe local galaxy U \u2212 B color distribution comes from the\ncompilation by Prugniel & Heraudeau (1998), available from\nthe CDS (http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/CDS.html). This database\nconsists of observations from a variety of sources. From approximately 5000 galaxies in the compilation, we choose those\nwith T-type less than 0 and U \u2212 B uncertainty less than 0.1 magnitude, yielding 290 early-type galaxies. Additionally, since the\ncolor of the galaxy depends on its magnitude, we must check\nthat the absolute magnitudes of both samples (distant and local) are consistent. The absolute magnitude range for the distant early-type sample is \u221222.5 < MB < \u221219.4; however the\nproper local comparison should include the magnitude dimming. Thus, the range that we select from the local sample\nis \u221221.5 < MB < \u221218.7. This cut leaves 219 local galaxies.\nIncluding the brighter objects would not change the results significantly since the local U \u2212 B distribution for all early-types\nis quite narrow. The mean U \u2212 B for local early-types is 0.52,\nusing either the full sample or the magnitude cut. Using an extreme cut on T-type less than \u20133 produces only a slightly redder\nU \u2212 B of 0.55. Another important point is to consider possible\ndifferences between field and cluster galaxies, since our sam-\n\n\f14\nple comes from the field. Again, the distribution of U \u2212 B is so\nsmall that any differences between local field and cluster galaxies will be insignificant for our purposes. Once larger samples\nare studied, both distant and local, this comparison would be\nworthwhile.\n\nF IG . 8.- Rest frame integrated U \u2212 B colors for the distant early-type field\nsample (blue solid line), bulge component of the early-type field sample (blue\ndotted line), MS1054-03 cluster (green line), local sample (black line), and the\nKoo et al. (2003) bulge sample from the distant field (red dotted line). The\nuncertainties for colors of the distant field sample is on average 0.03 mags,\nwhich is significantly smaller than the width of the color distribution.\n\nFigure 8 compares U \u2212 B distributions for total galaxy light in\nour distant early-type field sample, their bulge components, the\ncluster MS1054-03 at z = 0.83 from van Dokkum et al. (1999), a\nbulge field sample from Koo et al. (2003), and the local sample\n(total light). Each curve represents an adaptive kernel density\nestimate (Silverman 1986). The details of the adaptive kernel\nare given in Gebhardt et al. (1996). The goal is to measure a\nsmooth underlying density distribution from a small number of\npoints. A histogram represents the most basic and coarse approximation to a density distribution. A more robust estimate\nrelies on varying the window size depending on the local density; this is the adaptive kernel. We use an initial fixed kernel\nwidth to estimate the local density, and then run a kernel which\nvaries in width inversely according to that initial density to obtain the final density. This estimate preserves the information\ncontent in low-density relative to high-density regions.\nFor the total-galaxy light samples, the trends in Fig. 8 show\nthat the bluest objects are the field galaxies at high-z, the next\nare the cluster galaxies at z=0.83, and the reddest sample contains the local galaxies. These trends are consistent with passive evolution and having the cluster ellipticals that existed in\nMS1054 at z = 0.8 form stars earlier than our field early-types\nat the same epoch. As expected, the bulge components for the\nfield galaxies are redder than their total colors and are consistent with the bulge colors of the Koo et al. bulge sample.\nThese color distributions are discussed in detail below and in\nKoo et al.. The Koo et al. bulge sample consists of all galax-\n\nies with bulges brighter than I = 23.6 and includes 44% of our\ngalaxies-thus, the close agreement between the U \u2212 B colors\nof the two samples seen in Fig. 8 (0.04 mag) is expected.\n5. DISCUSSION\n\nViable evolutionary scenarios for early-type galaxies must\nmatch both the changes seen in Fundamental Plane surface\nbrightness and in color. Complications arise due to the uncertainty in knowing which galaxy property in the FP is changing\nwith time. Another source of confusion is that dust properties\nmay change with time, and their effects should be included.\nBoth size and velocity dispersion may evolve and affect the\ndistribution in the Fundamental Plane. A full treatment of the\nsize and dispersion distribution requires detailed modeling of\nthe selection functions and will not be explored here. However,\nthe most straightforward interpretation of luminosity evolution\nmeasured by Im et al. (2002) is that of stellar-population evolution only. Furthermore, preliminary analysis using a similar\nstudy to that in Im et al. for the luminosity evolution shows little\nevolution in the size function. There appears to be slight evolution in the velocity dispersion-of order 10% near z=0.8 but\nwith large uncertainty. This dispersion offset implies a change\nof only 0.16 magnitudes in surface brightness. Thus, the true luminosity evolution may be 0.16 magnitudes less than the magnitude offset seen in Fig. 5 at z = 0.8.\nOn theoretical grounds, hierarchical clustering predicts that\nmergers will occur primarily from parabolic orbits. Homologous merger models for such cases predict very little change\nin sigma but a doubling of the radius (for equal-mass mergers). In general, radius will grow in proportion to mass, with\nsigma staying constant. Since local galaxies show that surface\nbrightness goes inversely with radius, the effect of mergers on\nthe Fundamental Plane is to move galaxies along rather than\naway from it. Thus, as the simplest approach, we consider FP\nevolution to be due solely to luminosity evolution with no dust\nevolution, and discuss possible consequences of this assumption.\n5.1. Magnitude Evolution\nThe scatter in the FP and how it evolves over time is an important quantity to measure. To measure the scatter, we first\nremove the evolutionary effect by using the cubic fit in Fig. 5,\nwhere we have assumed that all evolution is due to stellar luminosity evolution. Figure 9 plots the Fundamental Plane corrected empirically for this evolution. The correction uses a cubic in redshift given by: < SBe >0 =< SBe >z +3.38z \u2212 4.97z2 +\n4.011z3. The resulting root-mean squared (RMS) scatter orthogonal to the local calibration in Fig. 9 is 7.8% using only\nthe early-type galaxies. This scatter is slightly larger than that\nseen in local samples: the Bernardi et al. (2003) sample has a\nscatter of 5.6% in residuals calculated orthogonal to the best-fit\nline. The Faber et al. and J\u00f8rgensen et al. sample have similarly\nsmall scatter. Since the scatter seen in our high redshift data is\nsimilar to that seen locally, we are confident that measurement\nuncertainty does not hinder our ability to probe evolutionary effects using the FP. Surprisingly, the expected scatter due to the\nobservational errors alone is around 7.5%, almost equal to the\nmeasured RMS. If we include the intrinsic scatter as measured\nfrom Bernardi et al., we would expect a measured RMS of 9%.\nThe small scatter that we see in our sample is similar to the\nscatter that Treu et al. (2002) find in their sample of 30 field\nellipticals at lower redshifts. Given that the measured scatter is\n\n\f15\nnearly consistent with the expected scatter based on local samples, we conclude that the intrinsic scatter at high redshift must\nbe small.\nFigure 9 includes both spheroidal and disk galaxies. Since\nmost FP analyses are done using a sample of only early-type\ngalaxies, we must be careful about introducing potential biases.\nKelson et al. (2000a) present detailed analysis of this bias in\ntheir cluster at redshift z = 0.33. Comparing the FP derived\nfrom their 30 E and S0 galaxies to that derived from their 22\nS0/a and later type galaxies, they find both that the FP scatter\nincreases by a factor of two and the later-type galaxies are systematically brighter. Due to a strong correlation between FP\noffset and velocity dispersion, they conclude that most of this\ndifference is due to stellar population differences. Correcting\nfor this age effect makes the spirals fall onto the FP for their\nellipticals, although still with a factor of two increased scatter.\nThe signal-to-noise of our images, spatial resolution of\ngalaxies at redshifts near 0.8, and observed bandpass shifting\n(restframe U and B) make it difficult to rely on visual classifications as Kelson et al. (2000a) have done. We rely instead\non bulge/disk decompositions to classify galaxies into early and\nlate types (see Im et al. 2002 and Simard et al. 2002). We also\ndo not have enough late-type galaxies in our sample to compare at the same level of detail used in Kelson et al., but we do\nsee a general trend of increased scatter from the late types compared to the early types. The green points in Fig. 9 have bulge\nfractions less than 0.4 which we consider to be disk-dominated\ngalaxies; indeed, these galaxies often show obvious signs of\nspiral structure in Fig. 1. These galaxies lie slightly above the\nline in Fig. 9. This is expected since the increased star formation rate in spirals tends to create a more constant surface\nbrightness over time, and hence less evolution. The difference\nbetween the late and early types is about 0.4 magnitudes, where\nthe late types have a smaller offset at a given redshift. Inspection of galaxies with high bulge fractions (those expected to be\ntrue ellipticals) shows no trends away from the full population.\nThis small difference is also seen in local samples. Falc\u00f3nBarroso et al. (2002) place S0\u2013Sbc galaxies on the Fundamental Plane defined for nearby cluster ellipticals. They find that\nlater type galaxies are slightly brighter than the cluster ellipticals, but the difference implies a single-burst age difference of\nat most 2.5 Gyr, and most likely smaller. Thus, it appears that\neven if we include the disk-dominated galaxies in our analysis,\nthe results would not be significantly effected.\nFig. 9 also demonstrates that there is little apparent change of\nFP slope with redshift. If galaxies evolved differently according to their size, the residuals in Fig. 9 would show a trend with\ngalaxy size, assuming that we have applied the proper average\nevolutionary correction.\n\nF IG . 9.- The edge-on projection of the distant Fundamental Plane adjusted\nfor stellar luminosity evolution relation in Fig. 5. Red points are galaxies with\nredshifts greater than 0.75; blue points are below 0.75. The solid line is the\nbest-fit calibration to the local sample. The green open circles are galaxies that\nhave bulge fractions less than 0.4, which are considered late-type galaxies.\n\nOne goal for Fundamental Plane studies is to use luminosity\nevolution to measure the stellar population formation history.\nFrom their study of MS1054-03 at z = 0.83 with a magnitude\nbrightening of around 0.9 mag, van Dokkum et al. (1998) conclude that the star formation time for this cluster is greater than\nz = 2.5 assuming a single-burst model. Our much larger brightening for field galaxies implies more recent formation. To measure the change in galaxy brightness due to stellar population\naging, we use stellar population models of Bruzual & Charlot (1998) and fit for the best-fit formation redshift. The best-fit\nmodel for the field is shown as the red line in Fig. 5. The formation redshifts for the field and cluster are 1.3 and >3.0, respectively. However, as discussed next, by using only the magnitude\nevolution we are ignoring an important constraint on evolutionary models, namely the color. When color is introduced, the\nsimple single-burst stellar population model no longer fits the\nfield galaxy population.\n5.2. Stellar Population Models\nColors provide another parameter which, when combined\nwith luminosity evolution, place tight limits on acceptable stellar population models. Figure 10 plots the magnitude offset\n(from Fig. 5) versus rest-frame U \u2212 B color for early-types. As\nseen in both Fig. 10 and Fig. 8, rest-frame colors evolve very little (less than 0.2 mag) compared to local galaxies. Included in\nFig. 10 are the points from van Dokkum & Ellis (2003), which\nshow very similar U \u2212 B colors but less magnitude evolution.\nThis amount of color change is not consistent with any single\nmetallicity and age. Shown in Fig. 10 are two metallicities, solar and 2.5 times solar. Metallicities in between these values\nspan the curves shown in Fig. 10. The problem is to reconcile\nthe local red colors (around U \u2212 B = 0.52) with the similarly red\ncolors (around 0.34) seen in distant galaxies that have over two\nmagnitudes of brightening.\n\n\f16\n\nF IG . 10.- Rest-frame U \u2212 B versus B magnitude dimming, the latter measured as residuals from the FP. The arrow labeled \"local\" is the mean integrated color of\nthe local early-type sample picked to match the distant field sample after fading (see Section 3 and Fig. 8). Blue points represent early-type field galaxy sample and\nthe one green point represents the cluster MS1054. The open symbols are the field galaxies from van Dokkum & Ellis (2003). The error bars in the bottom right\nrepresent typical 68% uncertainties. The two black lines refer to single-burst stellar population models with metallicity solar and 2.5 times solar. The current age of\nboth galaxies is 10 Gyr in both cases, corresponding to a formation epoch z f = 1.9, and the red labels correspond to the age of the galaxy at that position. The green\nline results from including protracted star formation assuming 2.5 solar metallicity and an exponentially falling star-formation rate with an e-folding time of 5 Gyr.\nThe total amount of mass in this protracted component from the initial burst to the present is 7% of the total mass. Notice that in order to match the very red colors\ndespite large magnitude offsets, all models must start with high metal content.\n\nTwo plausible scenarios are population changes over time\nand changes in dust contribution over time. Dust provides the\nmechanism to make galaxies redder at high redshift if the dust\nis more significant in the past. We know for local early-type\ngalaxies that dust does have appreciable effects (Falco et al.\n1999 and Goudfrooij & de Jong 1995). However, the amount of\ndust required at high redshift to explain the color change would\ncause us to notice its effect when looking at galaxies at different inclinations. Koo et al. (2003) find consistent magnitudes\nand colors among their bulge samples between the edge-on and\nface-on samples. Thus, we conclude that dust should not be\na major contribution to the reddening of these galaxies. Furthermore, if dust were more prevalent at high redshifts, then\n\nthe galaxies would appear both redder and fainter. Dust would\nhelp to alleviate the problem with having very red galaxies at\nhigh redshift, but it would cause the galaxies to have an even\nmore extreme magnitude brightening which would push make\nthe single-burst formation epoch of z = 1.5 to even later times.\nAn alternative approach is to invoke a changing stellar population. The ways to do this include allowing for a contamination\nfrom stars with different metallicities, different ages, or a combination of both. Either of these models can be made to work;\nhowever, in both, the underlying requirement is to have galaxies that contain very red colors at high-redshift. The only way\nto do this is to have an extreme high-metallicity base component, or make the Universe old enough that stars have the time\n\n\f17\nto redden as they age. Since we have some basic constraints on\nthe age of the Universe from many cosmological studies, and\nage constraints on local ellipticals (see Trager et al. 2000 for\nthe most recent analysis), we are forced to use stars with highmetallicity to explain the red colors. Thus, we always start with\na base population that has 2.5 times solar metallicity. Models\nby either Bruzual & Charlot (1998) or Worthey (1994) produce\nsimilar results. One model includes accretion from a low metallicity component. As seen in Fig. 10, low metallicity stars have\na bluer color, and thus their addition would serve to make the\npopulation bluer. An acceptable accretion model (i.e., one that\nmaintains constant U \u2212 B) includes accreting stars with 1/50th\nsolar metals that are the same age as the base galaxy. The accretion is constant during the time when the galaxy aged from\n1-3 Gyrs, and the total mass accreted is 10%. Other models\nwith different accretion histories will also work, but the main\nrequirement is that the accreted material have very low metals if one uses the same age for both the base and the accreted\nmaterial. Unfortunately, it seems unreasonable to require the\naccreted material to have such low metallicity when the base\ngalaxy's is so high. We therefore turn to star formation as a\npossible mechanism.\nAs stars age they become redder. Thus, if we were to include stars with younger ages, these blue stars would serve to\nmake the whole population bluer. We then simply adjust the\namount of new stars to make a null color change. The green\nline in Fig. 10 shows such a model. The base population consists of stars with 2.5 times solar metals (the upper black line in\nthe figure) that are 10 Gyr old today. An exponentially declining star formation history provides the necessary young stars\nto maintain constant color over time. The new stars have solar\nmetallicity, and the parameters are such that the contribution\ntoday from the new stars is 7% by mass and the e-folding time\nfor their formation is 5 Gyr. Keep in mind that most of the stars\nare formed at early times; the age weighted by the B light is\n7.9 Gyr and weighted by the U light is 5.7 Gyr, compared to\nthe age of the base population of 10 Gyr. These assumptions\nimply an intermediate mass for the new population since we\nare making new stars from solar-metallicity gas. Lower metals,\nbeing bluer, would require a smaller amount of new stars; similarly, stars from higher metals would require more new stars.\nThus, if we use 2.5 times solar metals, we find that 10% of the\ntotal mass must be in new stars (with average ages of 8.1 Gyr\nfor the B light and 6.2 Gyr for the U light), and using 1/5 solar metals requires only 4% of the total mass. Any metallicity\ncan trace a nearly identical curve in Fig. 10 solely by adjusting\nthe fractional contribution of the new component. Thus, given\nthe large degeneracies and limited size of the present data, we\nwill not explore this further. However, for any metallicity the\ncommon requirements are: 1) the base component must have\nhigh metals (2.5 times solar) otherwise we cannot achieve red\nenough colors at early times; 2) the star formation rate must be\npeaked at early times, otherwise the constancy of U \u2212 B cannot\nbe maintained; and 3) the amount of late forming stars cannot\nexceed 10%. The conclusion of 2) above is largely independent\nof the stellar population model since it results from a differential measurement. However, 1) and 3) rely on good calibration\nof the stellar population models in an absolute sense in the ultraviolet region, which is not very well tested. The fact that\nthe two sets of models-Bruzual & Charlot and Worthey-give\nsimilar results provides some comfort that the stellar population\nmodels are accurate.\n\nLocal studies provide some insight into whether the above\nstar formation history is correct. Trager et al. (2000a and\n2000b) investigate local field early-type galaxies to infer their\nstellar population histories using structural and spectral parameters. They find that local field ellipticals span a large\nrange in luminosity-weighted ages, with a slight tendency for\nlower-dispersion galaxies to be younger. Furthermore, their\nbest model suggests that galaxies are made up of an older single stellar population with a contribution from younger stars.\nThis younger population appears to come from pre-enriched gas\nrather than low-metallicity gas. While this scenario is similar\nto our picture, the details differ, mainly in regards to the metallicity of the base component. A second issue is the U-band\ncolor, which has not yet been properly calibrated of non-solar\nabundances ratios. The high metallicity-around 2.5 solar-\nrequired to achieve the very red colors at early times here appears to be too high for the integrated metallicities measured\nfor local samples-generally from 1 to 1.5 solar. Resolution\nof this difference may lie in a variety of places but possibly in\nthe stellar population models. At redshifts near 1, we are seeing galaxies as young as or younger than 2 Gyr. These young\nages pose a particularly challenging task for stellar population\nmodels since the stellar properties change rapidly during these\ntimes, and one has to be careful about the input initial mass\nfunction, burst length, and many other details which change\ndepending on which model is used. Broadhurst & Bouwens\n(2000) demonstrate how changing the IMF can cause very red\ncolors for young galaxies\u2013although at the expense of a very\ntruncated IMF. As the data increase and stellar population models at young ages become more sophisticated, we will be in a\ngood position to re-examine these issues.\nWe can compare the above model of the star formation history for field early-types to the model of van Dokkum & Franx\n(2001) for cluster galaxies. They attempted to explain a similar problem that we have: high redshift galaxies in clusters\ntend to have too large a magnitude evolution for their constant,\nred colors. An additional problem is that the spread of cluster\ncolors is very small, too small to be consistent with the cluster spread seen locally. Van Dokkum & Franx invoke a model\nbased on \"progenitor bias\" in which the galaxies in their FP\nsample at high redshift do not represent the bulk of local cluster\ngalaxies today. The galaxies that we observe in clusters today\nhave undergone significant evolution-from spirals to ellipticals during merging-such that at redshifts near one, they are\nnot included in early type galaxies samples. Thus, the color\nspread seen in high redshift ellipticals does not represent these\ntoday since they represent only the oldest galaxies. Including\nthe colors of the progenitor spirals in the sample will increase\nthe scatter and better match the scatter seen in nearby cluster ellipticals. The consequence is that when an elliptical is formed,\nit appears as a red galaxy since the stars in the progenitor spirals are all formed at very high redshifts (z > 3). In their model,\nvan Dokkum & Franx do not need to invoke a changing stellar\npopulation to maintain a low scatter in the galaxy colors. In\norder to explain their data, they suggest that 50% of the earlytype galaxies in clusters are formed after a redshift of one. If\nthis model were also true for the field sample, this large fraction\nof ellipticals would be seen in the evolution of the luminosity\nfunction. Im et al. (2002) measure essentially no change in the\nnumber density of field ellipticals out to a redshift of one. Their\nresults exclude an increase in field ellipticals of 50% from z = 1\nto today by high significance (97%). Thus, we cannot make the\n\n\f18\ncluster model of van Dokkum & Franx work for our sample.\nWe find that the field ellipticals have formation epochs at redshifts less than 2, and likely around 1.5. The oldest cluster ellipticals that are fully formed by z = 1 have formation epochs\nz > 2.5. The age difference is around 2Gyr. We can see if\nthis age difference is possible from studies that compare local\nfield and cluster ellipticals. The most complete study comes\nfrom Bernardi et al. (1998). Based on analysis of the Mg\u2013\u03c3\ncorrelation, they find little age difference between the field and\ncluster galaxies. They suggest that field galaxies are on average\n1.2 \u00b1 0.35 Gyr younger than cluster galaxies. However, as is\nshown by Trager et al. (2000a), the Mg\u2013\u03c3 correlation is a composite of both age and metallicity trends. Thus, it is difficult\nto draw definitive conclusions so far about the local population. Another difficulty in constraining age differences is that\nas a galaxy ages, the rate at which it fades slows down. Thus,\nage differences between two old galaxies (like those seen today) have a more subtle effect than in young galaxies (such as\nat redshifts near one). Furthermore, the Bernardi et al. cluster comparison sample represents the most extreme forms of\noverdensities; i.e., they are some of the largest clusters ever observed. Thus, if the galaxy formation epoch relates to the local\ndensity, then the high redshift cluster/field comparison is biased\ncompared to the same at low redshift, where we have included\na much larger range of cluster sizes. Therefore, age differences\nbetween the high redshift cluster/field sample are likely to be\nlarger than those seen at low redshift.\n\nF IG . 11.- The relative contribution of giant stars in best-fit template versus\nthe magnitude offset from the Fundamental Plane. The three bins which we\nused for the stellar template are A dwarfs, F\u2013G dwarfs, and G\u2013K giants. There\nis a trend for galaxies with small magnitude offsets to have larger contribution\nfrom more evolved stars. Filled circles are early-types and open circles are\ndisk-dominated galaxies.\n\n5.3. Stellar Population Fraction\nWe can also use the stellar templates that the spectral fitting\nprocess chooses as probes of galaxy age. Many galaxies have\nspectra covering regions from restframe 2500 \u00c5 to 6000 \u00c5.\nThese regions include Balmer lines, which are good age indica-\n\ntors. Figure 2 and Table 2 contain the relative fractions of stellar\ntypes. We divide the template contributions into three bins by\nadding up the similar stellar types in the two different sets of\nlibraries. The three bins include A stars, F\u2013G dwarfs, and G\u2013K\ngiants. We plot the fraction of giant stars against the magnitude\noffset from the Fundamental Plane in Figure 11. There is a dramatic decrease of giant star contribution for galaxies with larger\nmagnitude offsets. This decrease corresponds to an increase in\nthe contribution of younger stars (the A-G dwarfs). We find no\nsignificant trends between the A or F\u2013G dwarfs. This trend is\nobvious from inspection of the spectra. For those galaxies with\nlarge contribution from young stars, we notice strong Balmer\nlines which are absent in those galaxies dominated by giant star\nspectra. We could use the relative contribution as an age indicator, similar to what we did for the magnitude offset and color\nchange in Figure 10; however, a full treatment will have to wait\nuntil the stellar population models have been scrutinized in the\nH+K region and the sample size increases, since there is considerable noise in the estimate of the stellar makeup. In any\nevent, the correlation in Fig. 11 suggests that larger magnitude\noffsets indicate younger stellar systems.\nWe have checked whether the correlation seen in Fig. 11 results from A stars having broader lines in the H+K region. If,\nfor example, the fitting algorithm chooses A stars for a template\nas opposed to a giant star, then the implied velocity dispersion\nwould be smaller using the A templates. This decrease in the\nwidth would cause a larger offset from the FP, which could lead\nto the correlation in Fig. 11. However, for those galaxies with\nlow velocity dispersions, we have re-measured dispersions using subsets of templates from A stars to giant stars. We find\nlittle difference in the galaxy velocity dispersion. Furthermore,\nthe line ratios change dramatically from A dwarfs to K giants.\nThe fitting algorithm naturally takes this into account when it\nchooses which stars provide the best fit.\nMany A stars are rotationally broadened and we must consider whether this impacts our measured dispersions. The study\nof Hubrig et al. (2000) presents the distribution of v sin i for\nboth young and old stars. The peak of the distribution for both\nthe old and young A-stars is around 100 km s\u22121 , with a tail\nup to 250 km s\u22121 . If the galaxy light is dominated by fastrotating A stars and we do not include this in the analysis, then\nwe may overestimate the velocity dispersion. Alternatively, we\ncould underestimate the dispersion if our template A star has\nsystematically higher rotation. Neither of these are important\nfor our results. The v sin i for our template stars are all less than\n60 km s\u22121 . However, some of our galaxies are dominated by\nA stars. We can estimate the effect on the dispersion from the\nv sin i distribution. For a star rotating at 100 km s\u22121 , the FWHM\nof a Balmer line will be around that value and most likely\nsmaller depending on the amount of limb darkening. Thus, the\ndispersion due to rotation is around 40 km s\u22121 . Since all of the\nmeasured galaxy dispersions are over 100 km s\u22121 , even if the\ngalaxy is completely dominated by A stars, the effect will be\nminimal. In order for the A star rotation to have a significant\nimpact on the galaxy, all of the A stars in the galaxy would have\nto have rotations that are at the extreme maximum of the known\ndistribution. This is unlikely and we conclude that rotation of\nthe A stars is insignificant for our purposes.\n5.4. Other Concerns\nOne of the primary issues that arise when comparing redshifted samples to local samples is whether we are looking at\n\n\f19\nthe same objects. The local Fundamental Plane sample is comprised primarily of at least spheroidal or early-type galaxies.\nWe have been careful in our analysis to highlight galaxies classified as early-type (58% percent of our sample); however there\nis uncertainty in this classification system. To estimate the effect of this concern, we can use the location in the Fundamental\nPlane of the disk-dominated galaxies. The 15 disk-dominated\ngalaxies provide very similar magnitude offsets and colors as\nthe 21 early-types. Thus, if we blindly compare these distant,\ndisk-dominated galaxies to the local early-type population, we\nwould arrive at similar conclusions. As seen in Fig. 5, nonspheroidal galaxies have a slightly larger scatter at a given redshift, but on average they follow the same magnitude evolution.\nFrom Fig. 9, we see that the late-type galaxies (those that have\nbulge fractions less than 0.4 and tend to show spiral structure)\ntend to have very slightly less luminosity evolution, suggesting that there is at most a small bias. Therefore, even if our\nclassification system includes some galaxies that would not be\nincluded locally, the results would be unchanged.\nA further complication in terms of the sample properties is\nthat we are using total galaxy properties instead of bulge properties, which are likely to be more appropriate for FP studies.\nKoo et al. (2003) present a detailed analysis of bulge properties\nfor a large sample of objects that includes many of our galaxies. We refer to that paper for a detailed discussion of bulge\nproperties. Since we cannot separate the velocity dispersion\ninto contributions from the bulge and disk light, we simply use\ntotal galaxy properties. However, even for local Fundamental\nPlane studies, this decomposition is not used, implying that our\ndistant early-type sample should provide the best comparison.\nThe large magnitude offsets from the Fundamental Plane are\nmuch larger than any of our systematic effects, and are thus\nreal. The relevant parameters are \u03c3, Re , and surface brightness.\nAperture errors in surface brightness are at most 10%, which\nimplies 0.10 magnitudes. Systematic errors in Re are less than\n10% as well. However, by plotting the combination of log Re\nand log SB used here, the systematic errors are greatly reduced\nsince the two parameters are correlated. Kelson et al. (2000)\nestimate that their systematic errors on the FP offset from Re\nand surface brightness is less than 3% at z = 0.5. Systematic\nerrors in \u03c3 are likely to be less than 15%, or 0.2 magnitudes in\nsurface brightness. Thus, the largest uncertainties come from\nthe measurement of \u03c3, and these are much smaller than the \u22482\nmagnitude differences seen in Figure 5.\nKochanek et al. (2000) and Rusin et al. (2003) use strong\ngravitational lensing from the CASTLES project to infer the\nvelocity dispersion of field lensing galaxies, and, hence, measure their location in the Fundamental Plane. Van de Ven et\nal. (2003) follow up on these measurements with a re-analysis.\nRusin et al. have 28 lenses out to redshifts of one, and find\na significantly smaller magnitude brightening than we do-\ninconsistent also with the results of Im et al. (2002) and Treu\net al. (2002). Their offset is similar to the average found by\nvan Dokkum et al. (1998, 2001, 2003) for cluster and field\ngalaxies. Fortunately, we have one galaxy in common between our sample and Rusin et al.'s: the quad lens 093_2470\n(HST14176+522), at redshift 0.81. For this galaxy, we measure\na velocity dispersion of 202 km s\u22121 , while their dispersion is\n275 km s\u22121 , which is reflected in the difference in magnitude\nbrightening. Kochanek et al. (2000) have four other galaxies (with redshift below 0.4) with both spectroscopic and lens\n\nvelocity dispersions; they find agreement between the two estimates. Thus, it is not clear what the reasons are for the differences. However, the dispersion difference for 093_2470 is\nreal, and the next step is to include a larger sample of highredshift comparison objects. The re-analysis by van de Ven et\nal. (2003) suggests even less of a difference between our results and the lensing results. They estimate a mean formation\nredshift of 1.8+1.4\n\u22120.5 , which is well within our range, although still\nat earlier redshifts than what we measure. They further conclude that the field lens galaxies are about 10-15% younger\nthan the cluster galaxies. Rusin et al. (2003) note the difference between their Fundamental Plane and that of Treu et al.\n(2002) as being due to their mass-selected sample compared to\nthe other luminosity-selected samples, but this does not explain\nthe difference seen in the direct comparison above. However,\nthis selection effect may be part of the answer for why there are\noverall differences among various Fundamental Plane studies.\n6. CONCLUSION\n\nWe have conducted a study of the photometric and kinematic\nparameters of distant early-type filed galaxies and compared to\nlocal values. Assuming that radii and velocity dispersion do\nnot evolve, we find a progressive brightening in surface brightness back in time that amounts to over two magnitudes at z = 1.\nIntegrated U \u2212 B colors in contrast evolve much less. These\nfindings broadly agree with published results for distant cluster\nearly-type galaxies except that the surface-brightening effect in\nthe field population is roughly twice as large.\nA consistent star-formation model that accounts for the evolution in brightness but not in color involves an early burst\nof metal-rich stars comprising >90% of the mass, to which\na younger population comprising <10% of the mass is added\nlater with an e-folding time of about five Gyr. This model is\nnot unique but does imply that early-type field galaxies consist\nmainly of old stars with a frosting of younger stars formed later.\nSome evidence for a younger frosting has indeed been found in\nspectral studies of local field early-type galaxies.\nNot answered bu this study is whether the younger stellar\npopulations forms smoothly, as assumed here, or in bursts. Also\nnot answered is the age of the oldest stars, i.e., the age of the initial period of intense star formation. The mean light-weighted\nluminosities of our field stellar populations at z = 1 are sufficiently bright that it is possible that the formation redshift could\nbe as low as 1.4. If so, red galaxies should begin to disappear\nfrom the field shortly before z = 1. This trend should be detectable in deep K-band studies of distant field galaxies that are\ncurrently in progress and will be published soon. Thus, it is\npossible that the long-sought transformation from blue protogalaxies to mature red E/S0's may shortly be detected, at least\nfor field populations.\nWe are grateful for useful discussion with Ricardo Schiavon,\nNicolas Cardiel, Raja Guhathakurta, Dan Kelson, and Pieter\nvan Dokkum.

A12.- The data and parametric fits for rest-frame U \u2212 B colors (left three columns) and the K-corrections (right three columns) for the local sample observed\nat different redshifts. The solid points represent the data and the lines are the parametric fits. The red line in the z = 0.8 plot for U \u2212 B is the van Dokkum et al.\ntransformation. The open circle is discussed in the text.\n\nThe plots on the left side of Figure A12 are the computed rest-frame U \u2212 B color against observed V \u2212 I color at the redshift listed\nin the plot. The panels on the right-side are the B magnitude K-corrections as a function of observed V \u2212 I color. To compute Kcorrections and rest-frame U \u2212 B colors, we use the SED database provided by Storchi-Bergmann, Calzetti, & Kinney (see\nhttp://www.stsci.edu/ftp/catalogs/nearby_gal/sed.html), which covers 1200\u20137500 \u00c5 using IUE and ground-based spectra for 99\ngalaxies, 43 of which have the full wavelength coverage. We place the specified wavelength bandpass at the appropriate location in the galaxy spectrum according to the redshift, and sum the flux. The filter curves and the V and I zeropoints come from the\nHST database. Since at redshifts around 0.8, observed V \u2212 I is similar to rest-frame U \u2212 B (except for a zeropoint shift), we transform\nall galaxies to rest-frame U \u2212 B to minimize SED uncertainties. Thus, from the 43 SEDs, we have rest-frame U \u2212 B for each redshift\nand observed V \u2212 I. Similarly, we also measure the K-corrections for rest-frame B using observed I and V \u2212 I. A polynomial fit for\nboth estimates to the SEDs produces the transformation for each of our galaxies. The polynomial is as follows\nU \u2212 B = \u22120.8079 \u2212 0.049752z \u2212 1.6232z2 + 1.04067z3 + 1.5294z4 \u2212 0.41190z5 \u2212 0.56986z6\n+(0.61591 + 1.07249z \u2212 2.2925z2 + 1.3370z3)(V \u2212 I) + (0.280481 \u2212 0.387205z + 0.043121z2)(V \u2212 I)2\n\n(A1)\n\nkB = 0.0496 + 0.46057z + 1.40430z2 \u2212 0.19436z3 \u2212 0.2232z4 \u2212 0.36506z5 + 0.17594z6\n+(2.0532 \u2212 2.8326z + 1.05580z2 \u2212 0.67625z3)(V \u2212 I) + (0.10826 \u2212 0.68097z + 0.61781z2)(V \u2212 I)2\n\n(A2)\n\nFigure A12 shows the data and the polynomial fits. There is one galaxy in the sample which is an obvious outlier-shown as an\nopen symbol, NGC 5128-which is excluded from the fit. Compared to the results of Bruzual & Charlot (1998) models, there is\nacceptable agreement, although we prefer to use the local spectra to provide the intrinsic scatter.\nThe comparison with the local color distribution of early-type galaxies in Section 3.1 uses observed values for U \u2212 B, and we must\nmake sure that our system estimated here from SEDs is on the same system as observed U \u2212 B's. There are 15 galaxies in common\nbetween the two samples. The average U \u2212 B difference between the two is 0.047 \u00b1 0.03, with the measured SED U \u2212 B being redder.\nThe quoted uncertainty is the 68% confidence band on the mean offset. A possible complication is that the aperture used for the\nSED U \u2212 B values is not the same that used for the local sample integrated colors. The aperture used for the SED's is a 10\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 20\u2032\u2032\nbox for both the IUE and ground-based spectra. Since this aperture does not encompass the full galaxy, we expect the SED colors\nto be slightly redder, as measured. However, the small measured difference between the two colors is consistent with zero and is\nfurthermore small for the effects that we discuss.\n\n\f22\n\nTABLE 1\nG ALAXY S

It is different for each galaxy since\nthe galaxy redshifts determine which regions to exclude. The S/N is calculated per pixel\nand the pixel size is given in column 4. Column 5 refers to whether we used either the\nKPNO or the Kobulnicky & Gebhardt (KG) template library. Columns 6, 7, and 8 refer\nto the fractional contribution of A dwarfs, F\u2013G dwarfs, and G\u2013K giants.\n\n\f"}
