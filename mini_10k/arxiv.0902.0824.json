The simplest example\nof such a 3D multilayer state is a stacking of N decoupled\nLaughlin states. [1, 2] At the next level of complexity, one\ncan construct states with interlayer correlations, such as\nthe (3, 3, 1) bilayer state. [3] More generally, multicomponent Chern-Simons theory allows one to construct a\nmyriad of N -layer analogues of the (3, 3, 1) state. [4]\nThese states are quite general but they suffer from a\nlimitation: they all have a fixed number of electrons in\neach layer. This restriction could be problematic for describing certain multilayer systems, especially those with\nappreciable interlayer tunneling. Therefore, alternative\nconstructions of 3D multilayer FQH states are desirable\ntheoretically.\nOn the experimental side, a number of experiments on\n3D semiconductor multilayers have explored the behavior\nof stacked integer quantum Hall states [5, 6, 7], including the novel vertical transport due to the conducting\nsurface sheath. [1, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] More recently,\nexperiments on bismuth crystals in high magnetic fields\nhave revealed intriguing anomalies in the ultra quantum\nlimit - the limit where the magnetic field is sufficiently\nlarge that only the lowest Landau level is (partially) occupied. [15] It has been suggested that a novel 3D fractional quantum Hall type state might be present. While\nthese are not layered materials, strong electron correlations could drive a transition wherein the electrons spontaneously form a weak layered structure, as suggested in\nrecent work. [16, 17] Bulk graphite also reveals transport\nanomalies in the ultra quantum limit [18, 19, 20], which\nhave been attributed to a charge density wave transition\nin this layered material. The observed quantum Hall effect in graphene [21, 22, 23, 24], and future prospects for\n\ngraphene multilayers, provides further impetus to explore\n3D layered quantum Hall phenomena.\nMotivated by these experiments, and the lack of previous theoretical exploration, we revisit the behavior of\nmultilayer systems in the fractional quantum Hall regime.\nGenerally, we are interested in addressing the following\nclass of questions: what is the fate of a weakly coupled\nstacking of 2D fractional quantum Hall states when the\ninterlayer electron tunneling becomes strong enough to\nclose the quantum Hall gap? In particular, are new\nfractional quantum Hall type states possible when the\nCoulomb interaction is comparable to the interlayer tunneling strength? We believe that this intermediate tunneling strength regime is both experimentally accessible\nand theoretically novel.\nAnswering these questions definitively for a specific microscopic model is quite challenging and likely requires\nextensive numerical calculation. Here, we are less ambitious. Our goal is simply to find candidate ground states\nfor the intermediate tunneling regime. This is already a\nnon-trivial problem since, as we mentioned earlier, most\nmultilayer states - such as those obtained from ChernSimons mean field theory - have a fixed number of electrons in each layer and hence are unnatural unless the\ninterlayer tunneling is weak.\nIn this paper, we construct a candidate ground state\nfor the simplest possible multilayer system: spinless (or\nspin polarized) electrons with an average filling of \u03bd =\n1/3 per layer. We speculate that the candidate state may\nbe realized at intermediate tunneling strength. However,\nour arguments for the candidate state are indirect, as we\ndo not make any detailed analysis of energetics.\nWe construct our candidate state using a slave-particle\ngauge theory approach known as the \"parton construction.\" [25, 26] The basic idea of the parton construction\nis to write the electron creation operator as a product of\nseveral (in our case, 3) fermionic parton creation operators. By choosing different mean field parton states, and\nincluding (gauge) fluctuations, one can construct differ-\n\n\f2\nent FQH states. The advantage of the parton construction is that it naturally leads to states with electron number fluctuations in each layer. Thus, parton FQH states\nmay be particularly natural in the intermediate tunneling regime. In addition, the particular state we construct\nhas the interesting property that one can tune from it to\na decoupled multilayer Laughlin state by changing a single coupling constant in the parton gauge theory. Given\nthat the multilayer Laughlin state is likely realized at\nweak interlayer tunneling, this is an additional reason\nwe consider our state to be a candidate ground state for\nintermediate interlayer tunneling.\nWe analyze the candidate state for both a finite number of layers N , and for the 3D limit, N \u2192 \u221e. For a\nfinite number of layers N , we find that the state is a fully\ngapped FQH state (when N = 1, it is simply the Laughlin state). The quasiparticle excitations are anyonic and\ncarry charge e/3. We find that the quasiparticle excitations are described by a K-matrix [27] of dimension\n(3N \u2212 2) \u00d7 (3N \u2212 2), along with a charge vector of length\n(3N \u2212 2).\nIn the 3D limit, the candidate state exhibits more\nunusual physics. It supports two types of excitations:\ngapped charge e/3 fermionic quasiparticle excitations\nand gapless, electrically neutral collective modes. The\ne/3 fermionic quasiparticle excitations (which are essentially the \"deconfined\" partons) are truly 3D quasiparticles and can move freely between layers. This should\nbe contrasted with the e/3 excitations in the multilayer\nLaughlin state which are confined to individual layers.\n(In this sense, our candidate state is \"more 3D\" then\nthe multilayer Laughlin state). As for the gapless electrically neutral collective modes, these are the emergent\nU (1) gauge bosons or \"photons\" which originate from\nfluctuations about the mean field parton state. Unlike\nMaxwell photons, these excitations have only one polarization state and have an anisotropic dispersion of the\nform \u03c9k2 \u223c k2\u22a5 + kz4 (for layers oriented in the xy plane).\nThe e/3 fermionic quasiparticles are minimally coupled\nto these \"photon\" modes and thus have long range interactions.\nThe edge physics of the N -layer and 3D systems is also\ninteresting. In the case of a finite number of layers N , the\nedge theory is a chiral boson conformal field theory with\n3N \u2212 2 chiral modes. The edge Lagrangian can be read\noff from the bulk K-matrix using the standard formalism.\n[27] The edge (or surface) physics in the 3D limit is more\ncomplex. For a 3D system with layers in the xy plane and\na boundary in the xz plane, the three flavors of dispersing edge modes form a \"sheath\" of chiral fermions. At\nthe mean field level these fermions are non-interacting,\nbut with fluctuations included are minimally coupled to\nthe gapless bulk \"photons\". The surface sheath, then, resembles a chiral analog of the Halperin-Lee-Read state,\n[28] which is protected against gap-forming instabilities\nby the topological character of the bulk phase.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section II\nwe speculate about phase diagrams of multilayer \u03bd =\n1/3 systems and we describe the intermediate tunneling\nregime in more detail. In section III we construct our\ncandidate state. In sections IV -VII, we analyze the bulk\n\nphysics of the candidate state for single layer, bilayer, N layer, and 3D systems. In section VIII we investigate the\ncrossover between 2D and 3D physics in systems with a\nlarge but finite number of layers. In section IX we describe the relationship between the candidate state and\nthe multilayer Laughlin state. Finally, in section X we\nanalyze the edge physics of the candidate state for N layer and 3D systems.\nII.\n\nMODEL AND POSSIBLE PHASE\nDIAGRAMS\n\nIn this section, we discuss the physics of N -layer \u03bd =\n1/3 FQH systems in more detail. We speculate about\npossible phase diagrams and we explain what the intermediate tunneling regime is, and why it is interesting.\nConsider a geometry where the layers are oriented in\nthe xy plane, and neighboring layers are spaced a distance a in the z direction. There are four energy scales\nin the problem - two intralayer and two interlayer scales.\nThe intralayer energy scales are the cyclotron energy\n~\u03c9c = ~eB/m, and the characteristic intralayer Coulomb\nenergy scale Ec = e2 /lB . The interlayer scales are the\ninterlayer Coulomb energy e2 /a and the interlayer tunneling strength tz . In the following discussion, we will\nfocus on the regime where (1) ~\u03c9c is much larger than\nany of the other energy scales, and (2) a is comparable\nto, but larger than lB so that the interlayer Coulomb\nenergy scale is smaller than, but on the same order as\nthe intralayer energy Ec . In this regime, there is only\none dimensionless parameter in the problem: the ratio\ng \u2261 tz /Ec .\nLet us think about the phase diagram as we vary the\ndimensionless ratio g = tz /Ec . To begin, suppose N = 2.\nWhen g = 0, there is no interlayer tunneling and we\nexpect that the ground state is given by two decoupled\nLaughlin \u03bd = 1/3 states, with perhaps small quantitative\nmodifications due to the interlayer Coulomb interaction.\nSince the Laughlin state is gapped, it will be stable to\nsmall interlayer hopping, i.e. g \u226a 1. In the opposite\nlimit, with very large interlayer tunneling g \u226b 1, all of\nthe electrons will be in the \"bonding band\" - the band\nconsisting of symmetric combinations of Landau orbitals\nin the two layers. The system is thus an effective single\nlayer system at filling \u03bd = 2/3. The weak Coulomb interactions will presumably lead to an abelian \u03bd = 2/3 state\nwith gap of order Ec .\nNow, consider the regime g \u223c 1. Starting from the\ndecoupled limit, when g is increased one expects that the\nquasiparticle gap in each layer will diminish and presumably be driven to zero at some critical value g1 . On the\nother hand, when g is brought down from large values,\nthe gap of the \"single layer\" \u03bd = 2/3 state will diminish (due to Landau level mixing into the \"antibonding\nband\") and be driven to zero at some value, g2 . Generally, there is no reason to expect that g1 = g2 , although\nit is possible that there is a direct first order transition\nbetween the 1/3 + 1/3 decoupled phase and the 2/3 \"single\" layer state. If g2 > g1 , there will be a third FQH\nphase (or phases) for g1 < g < g2 . This potential phase\n\n\f3\nis the \"intermediate coupling\" phase we consider in this\npaper.\nOne can imagine a similar scenario for the 3D limit,\nN \u2192 \u221e. Again, at weak interlayer tunneling, g \u226a 1,\nthe stack of Laughlin states is stable and can be readily\nanalyzed. [1] On the other hand, the nature of the strong\ntunneling phase with g \u226b 1 is non-trivial. In the noninteracting limit, the lowest Landau level in each layer\nwill form a band that disperses in the z\u2212direction, with\nenergy \u2212tz cos(kz a). The noninteracting ground state\nconsists of completely filling all of the lowest Landau\nlevel band states with |kz | < kF \u2261 \u03c0/3a. This describes\na gapless state. In a Wannier basis of orthonormalized\nlowest Landau level wavefunctions with guiding centers\nsitting on the sites of a regular 2D lattice (say triangular),\none can view the system as an array of one-dimensional\nnon-interacting electron systems. Gapless particle-hole\nexcitations exist across the two Fermi points in each of\nthe 1D \"wires\". This noninteracting state is likely to\nbe unstable in the presence of arbitrarily weak Coulomb\ninteractions, Ec 6= 0, due to the nested 2kF backscattering interactions between nearby \"wires\". The simplest scenario would be the development of a fully gapped\nQ = 2kF = 2\u03c0/(3a) charge density wave (CDW) state,\nwhich corresponds to a tripling of the unit cell along the\nz\u2212axis. Naively one would expect the CDW gap to scale\nas \u2206CDW \u223c tz exp(\u2212const. * g). [29, 30] This CDW state\ncan be loosely thought of as an effective system with N/3\nlayers, each one at filling \u03bdef f = 1.\nAs in the bilayer case, increasing g from small values will presumably close the Laughlin quasiparticle gap\nin each of the layers, destroying the decoupled phase at\nsome g1 . Similarly, when g is decreased from very large\nvalues down to order one the CDW state will become\ndisfavored due to the increasing intralayer Coulomb repulsion. One expects the CDW state to be destroyed for\nsome g < g2 . As for N = 2, it is possible that there is a\nthird phase for g1 < g < g2 - an \"intermediate tunneling\nphase.\"\nThe possibility of such an intermediate tunneling phase\nfor either the finite N case or the 3D limit N \u2192 \u221e,\nis the starting point for this paper. One reason we\nfeel it is a particularly interesting possibility is that the\ninterlayer tunneling and the Coulomb interaction are\nboth of paramount importance in such a putative phase.\nThis poses a theoretical challenge since the obvious FQH\nstates - such as those constructed from Chern-Simons\nmean field theory - have a fixed number of electrons in\neach layer and are therefore unnatural except for very\nweak interlayer tunneling. On the other hand, if one tries\nto construct a state by treating the N -layer system as an\neffective single layer system at filling N/3, the result is\nunnatural except for very strong interlayer tunneling. In\nthis paper, we use a different approach - a slave particle\nconstruction with fermionic \"partons\" - to build a candidate state that overcomes these difficulties.\n\nIII.\n\nPARTON CONSTRUCTION\n\nOur candidate state can be described most naturally\nusing the parton construction. [25, 26] Let us first describe the construction in the case of the single layer system; we will then generalize to multiple layers.\nOur starting point is the single layer electron Hamiltonian. As it will be convenient in what follows, we regularize this Hamiltonian, replacing the 2D continuum by\na square lattice. We take the flux through each plaquette in the lattice to be 2\u03c0/M , the electron density to be\n1/3M , and we consider the limit M \u2192 \u221e. In this limit,\nthe lattice model behaves like a 2D continuum with electrons at filling fraction \u03bd = 1/3.\nThe regularized electron Hamiltonian can be written\nas\nX\n(tc\u2020x ei\u00c3x,i cx+x\u0302i + h.c.) + interactions (1)\nH=\u2212\nxi\n\nwhere \u00c3x,i is a lattice gauge field with \u22061 \u00c3x,2 \u2212\u22062 \u00c3x,1 =\n2\u03c0/M , and \u00c3 is periodic with unit cell of size M . Here,\n\u2206i denotes a lattice derivative in the x\u0302i direction: \u2206i fx \u2261\nfx+x\u0302i \u2212 fx .\nIn the parton construction, we think of the electron as\na composite of 3 fermionic partons dp , p = 1, 2, 3:\nc = d1 d2 d3\n\n(2)\n\nWe then substitute the expression for c into this Hamiltonian and expand around a saddle point. The result is a\nnon-interacting mean-field Hamiltonian for the partons.\nMany different saddle points can be stabilized depending\non the details of the interactions. Different saddle points\ncorrespond to different FQH states.\nHere, we consider a particular saddle point. The saddle\npoint we are interested in is associated with the mean\nfield Hamiltonian\nX\n(3)\n(tp (dpx )\u2020 eiAx,i dpx+x\u0302i + h.c.)\nHmf = \u2212\nxip\n\nwhere Ax,i is a lattice gauge field with \u22061 Ax,2 \u2212\u22062 Ax,1 =\n2\u03c0/3M , and Ax,i is periodic with unit cell of size 3M .\nNotice that the flux 2\u03c0/3M is exactly the right size so\nthat the partons are at filling \u03bd = 1 (the partons, like the\nelectrons, are at density 1/3M ). We have also assumed\nthat the hopping amplitudes tp are different for the three\nspecies of partons.\nWhat is the physics of this parton state? At the\nmean field level, the parton state is a gapped state with\nfermionic excitations. However, this mean field result is\nnot quite correct, since we have not taken into account\nthe effect of fluctuations about the saddle point. These\nfluctuations are described by fluctuations in the hopping\namplitudes tp of the form tp \u2192 tp ei\u03b8p with \u03b81 +\u03b82 +\u03b83 = 0.\nWe can parameterize them in terms of two U (1) gauge\nfields Aq , q = 1, 2 by setting \u03b8p = Qpq Aq where q = 1, 2,\nand Qp1 = (1, 0, \u22121), Qp2 = (0, 1, \u22121). The effect of fluctuations is thus to couple the partons to two U (1) gauge\nfields Aq . (Note that the structure of the gauge fluctuations is closely tied to the symmetries of the saddle point.\n\n\f4\nFor example, at the symmetric saddle point t1 = t2 = t3\nthe fluctuations are described by SU (3) gauge fluctua\u2032\ntions tp \u2192 tp\u2032 Upp rather than the U (1) \u00d7 U (1) fluctuations present here [31]). Including these fluctuations, our\nHamiltonian is given by\nH = Ht + HA\n\n(4)\n\nwhere Ht describes the parton hopping and HA describes\nthe gauge field dynamics:\nX\nq\n(tp (dpx )\u2020 eiQpq Ax,i +iAx,i dpx+x\u0302i + h.c.) (5)\nHt = \u2212\n\nIV.\n\nWe begin with the simplest case: the single layer parton state. We rederive the well-known result that the\nsingle layer parton state is precisely the Laughlin state.\n[25, 26]\nTo understand the properties of the single layer parton\nstate, we need to analyze the low energy physics of the\nHamiltonian (4). One way to do this is to introduce U (1)\ngauge fields ap\u03bc to describe the parton number currents:\nj p\u03bb =\n\nxip\n\nXg\n\nHA =\n\nxiq\n\n2\n\nq 2\n(Ex,i\n) \u2212\n\nX\n\nJ cos(\u22061 Aqx,2 \u2212 \u22062 Aqx,1 )(6)\n\nxq\n\nThe parton state we are interested in is described by the\nabove Hamiltonian in the weak gauge fluctuation regime\n- e.g. g \u226a J, tp .\nGeneralizing this construction to the N layer case is\nstraightforward. In this case, the mean field parton\nHamiltonian is given by\nX\n(tp\u22a5 (dpxz )\u2020 eiAx,i dp(x+x\u0302i )z + h.c.)\nHmf = \u2212\nxzip\n\n\u2212\n\nX\n\n(tp3 (dpxz )\u2020 dpx(z+1) + h.c.)\n\n(7)\n\nxzp\n\nwhere z is the layer index and tp\u22a5 , tp3 are the intralayer\nand interlayer hopping amplitudes.\nIncluding the U (1)\u00d7U (1) gauge fluctuations, we arrive\nat\nH=\n\nN\nX\n\n(Hzt + HzA ) +\n\nz=1\n\nwhere Hzt , HzA describe the intralayer hopping and\ngauge field terms,\nX\nq\n(tp\u22a5 (dpxz )\u2020 eiQpq Axz,i +iAx,i dp(x+x\u0302i )z + h.c.)\nHzt = \u2212\nxip\n\n(9)\nHzA =\n\nX g\u22a5\nxiq\n\n2\n\nq\n(Exz,i\n)2\n\n\u2212\n\nX\nxq\n\nJ\u22a5 cos(\u22061 Aqxz,2\n\n\u2212\n\n\u22062 Aqxz,1 )\n(10)\n\nand Hz(z+1)t , Hz(z+1)A describe the interlayer hopping\nand gauge field terms,\nX\nq\nHz(z+1)t = \u2212\n(tp3 (dpxz )\u2020 eiQpq Axz,3 dpx(z+1) + h.c.)\nxp\n\nHz(z+1)A =\n\nX g3\nxq\n\n\u2212\n\nX\n\n2\n\nIncluding the minimal coupling to Aq gives\n1 X \u03bb\u03bc\u03bd p\n1 \u03bb\u03bc\u03bd\nL=\n\u01eb Qpq Aq\u03bb \u2202\u03bc ap\u03bd\n\u01eb a\u03bb \u2202\u03bc ap\u03bd +\n4\u03c0 p\n2\u03c0\n\nq\n(Exz,3\n)2\n\nJ3 cos(\u2206i Aqxz,3 \u2212 Aqxz,i + Aqx(z+1),i )\n\nxiq\n\nAgain, we assume that the gauge fluctuations are weak g3 \u226a J3 , tp3 , tp\u22a5 and g\u22a5 \u226a J\u22a5 , tp3 , tp\u22a5 .

We now analyze the basic properties of this\nstate.\nWe begin with the quasiparticle statistics. According\nto the K-matrix formalism, the quasiparticle excitations\ncan be labeled by integer vectors l. The exchange statistics of a quasiparticle l is given by \u03b8ex = \u03c0(lT K \u22121 l). The\nmutual statistics of two quasiparticles l,l\u2032 - e.g. the phase\nassociated with braiding one particle around another - is\ngiven by \u03b8mut = 2\u03c0(lT K \u22121 l\u2032 ).\nIn principle, these formulas completely specify the\nquasiparticle statistics of the parton state. However,\nit is convenient to describe the statistics of the parton\nstate in a more concise way. A general way to do this\nis to find a subset of quasiparticles with the property\nthat one can generate all topologically distinct quasiparticles by taking composites of these basic quasiparticles. One can then describe the complete quasiparticle\nstatistics by specifying the statistics of this generating\nsubset of quasiparticles. For the above state, the three\nparton excitations corresponding to l1 = (1, 0, 0, 0), l2 =\n(0, 1, 0, 0), l3 = (0, 0, 1, 0) generate all the others. (One\nway to see this is to note that the excitation (0, 0, 0, 1)\nis topologically identical to (2, 0, 0, 0)). Simple algebra\n\n\f6\nshows that the three parton excitations have exchange\nstatistics\n\u03b8p = \u03c0(lpT K \u22121 lp ) =\n\n2\u03c0\n3\n\n(31)\n\nand mutual statistics\n\u03b8pp\u2032 = 2\u03c0(lpT K \u22121 lp\u2032 ) =\n\n(1 + 3\u03b4pp\u2032 )\u03c0\n3\n\n(32)\n\nThis gives a complete description of the quasiparticle\nstatistics of the bilayer parton state. The electric charges\nof the quasiparticles are also easy to obtain. Again, it\nsuffices to specify the parton charges, which are given by\nqp = e * (tT K \u22121 lp ) =\n\ne\n3\n\nN is clear: along the diagonals there are three\n(N \u2212 1) \u00d7 (N \u2212 1) blocks of the form 1 + \u03b4ij , while the\nlast row and column is made up of \u22121's with a 3 in the\nbottom right-hand corner.\nAs before, the K-matrix and charge vector determine all the universal properties of the FQH state, such\nas the quasiparticle statistics and charges. Also, just\nas before, one can summarize the quasiparticle charges\nand statistics more concisely by specifying the statistics\nand charges of the three parton species (which correspond to l1 = (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), l2 = (0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),\nl3 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0) in the N = 3 case).\nOne finds that the parton excitations have exchange\nstatistics\n\n(33)\n\nNow that we have computed these properties, we can\nsee that the bilayer parton state is distinct from a bilayer of decoupled \u03bd = 1/3 Laughlin states as well as the\nconventional \u03bd = 2/3 state. Indeed, one can distinguish\nthe states by noting that the e/3 excitation in the parton\nstate has a statistical angle 2\u03c0/3, while the e/3 excitation\nin the other two states has an angle \u03c0/3.\nOne can also distinguish the states by their ground\nstate degeneracy on a torus. This quantity is particularly\neasy to measure in numerical calculations. The ground\nstate degeneracy for the bilayer parton state is just the\ndeterminant of K which is 12. On the other hand, the\ndegeneracy of a bilayer of decoupled \u03bd = 1/3 Laughlin\nstates is 9, and the degeneracy of the \u03bd = 2/3 state is 3.\nA final way to distinguish the states is via their thermal Hall conductances. Recall that each\nchiral boson\n\u03c0 2 k2\nedge mode gives a contribution of \u00b1 3hB T to the thermal Hall conductance, with the sign determined by the\nchirality of the mode. Thus, the thermal Hall conductance can be computed by counting the number of positive and negative eigenvalues of K. In the case of the\nbilayer parton state, there are four positive eigenvalues\n\u03c0 2 k2\nso the thermal Hall conductance is 4 (in units of 3hB T ).\nOn the other hand, the thermal Hall conductance for the\nbilayer of Laughlin states is 2 and the thermal Hall conductance for the \u03bd = 2/3 state is 0.\n\n\u03b8p =\n\n\u03b8pp\u2032 =\n\nThe corresponding charge vector is tT\n=\n(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1).\nThe generalization to arbitrary\n\n(2 + (6N \u2212 6)\u03b4pp\u2032 )\u03c0\n3N\n\n(36)\n\nand charge\nqp =\n\nVII.\n\ne\n3\n\n(37)\n\n3D LIMIT\n\nIn this section, we analyze the parton construction in\nthe 3D limit, N \u2192 \u221e.

Note that this\nis different from the approach we took in the single layer\nand bilayer cases where we integrated out the gauge fields\nAq instead. We could have used this approach in those\ncases as well. The advantage of this approach is that\nit leads to a simpler description of the bulk low energy\nphysics: the low energy effective theory for the N layer\ncase is simply a 2 \u00d7 2 Chern-Simons theory coupled to\nfermionic partons (instead of a (3N \u22122)\u00d7(3N \u22122) ChernSimons theory coupled to bosons). The disadvantage is\nthat the edge physics cannot be easily read off from the\nbulk effective theory. Here our primary interest is in the\nbulk physics - thus we choose to integrate out the fields\napz .\nIntegrating out the a field (e.g. the partons) produces\na Chern-Simons term for the A field.

Thus, such measurements could be used to distinguish the 3D parton\nstate from other candidate states - such as the decoupled Laughlin state. In section X we describe another\nexperimental signature of the 3D parton state, involving\nsurface excitations.\nIn addition to the gapless gauge excitations, the 3D\nstate also contains gapped parton excitations. These excitations are fermions, and carry electric charge q = e/3\nas in the N -layer case (37). They are minimally coupled to the gapless gauge bosons and therefore have long\nrange interactions. Note that these excitations are truly\n3D quasiparticles - they can propagate freely both within\nlayers and between layers. This should be contrasted\nwith the charge e/3 particles in the decoupled Laughlin\nstate, which are confined to individual layers. In this\nsense, the parton state is \"more 3D\" than the decoupled\nLaughlin state.\nVIII.\n\nCROSSOVER FROM 2D TO 3D\n\nIn the previous sections, we referred to the 3D limit as\nthe limit N \u2192 \u221e. However, the 3D limit can also be accessed when there are a finite number of layers - provided\nthat we probe the system at appropriate length and energy scales. In this section, we discuss this crossover from\n2D to 3D physics.\nConsider an N -layer system with N \u226b 1. This system\nis described by three species of partons minimally coupled\nto the the gauge theory (47). According to the analysis\nfollowing (47), the low energy modes of this gauge theory\nsatisfy the dispersion relation (56). Since N is finite, k3\nis quantized in multiples of \u03c0/N a. For each value of k3 ,\nthere is a corresponding 2D mode.\nThe mode with the smallest gap corresponds to k3 =\n\u03c0/N a; the dispersion relation for this mode is\n\u03c9 2 = J3 g3 a2 (k12 + k22 ) +\n\n4J32 \u03c0 6\nm2q N 4\n\np'\n\n(56)\n\np\nr\n\nFIG. 1: If r \u226b \u03be, the Berry phase associated with braiding a\nparton p around another parton p\u2032 is given by the 2D formula\n\u03b8pp\u2032 = 2\u03c0/3N . If r \u226a \u03be, it depends on the details of the path\nand can be calculated from the 3D gapless gauge theory (47).\n\nOne example of this crossover is the following thought\nexperiment. Imagine adiabatically braiding one charge\ne/3 parton excitation p around another e/3 parton excitation p\u2032 - say of a different species - using a braiding\npath parallel to the layers (see Fig. 1). First, consider\nthe case where the separation r between the partons is\nkept larger than \u03be. In this case, the modes (56) will be\neffectively frozen at this distance. While the presence of\nparton p\u2032 will change the gauge flux seen by parton p,\nthe gauge flux will be localized to within a distance \u03be of\np\u2032 , and will be exponentially suppressed near the braiding path. Thus, the only interaction between the two\npartons will be a statistical interaction: the presence of\nparton p\u2032 will change the total gauge flux enclosed by the\nbraiding path of parton p. The Berry phase associated\nwith braiding one parton around the other is then given\nby the 2D mutual statistics formula: \u03b8pp\u2032 = 2\u03c0/3N .\nNow, consider the case where the separation r between\nthe partons is kept much smaller than \u03be. In this case, the\nmodes (56) will not be frozen out and the partons will\nexperience long range interactions. The phase associated\nwith braiding one parton around the other will depend\non the details of the path, and can be calculated using\nthe 3D gapless gauge theory (47).\nAs for the crossover between the two regimes, we expect that the Berry phase in the 3D regime scales with\nthe separation between the partons according to some\npower law. When the separation is of order \u03be, we expect\nthat the phase is of order 1/N so that it agrees with the\nphase in the 2D regime.\n\n(57)\n\n2\nWe see that this mode has\np a gap \u2206 \u223c J3 /N and a\n2\ncorrelation length \u03be \u223c N a g3 /J3 .\nThe gap \u2206 and correlation length \u03be are the important energy and length scales in the 2D/3D crossover. If\none probes the system at energies less than \u2206 or lengths\nlarger then \u03be (parallel to the layers), all the modes with\nk3 6= 0 will freeze out and the system will behave like\na gapped 2D system. The physics is then described by\nthe gapped FQH state in section VI. On the other hand,\nif one probes the system at energies greater than \u2206 or\nlengths smaller then \u03be, the system will behave like a 3D\nsystem. In this case, the physics is described by partons\ncoupled to the gapless gauge theory (47).\n\nIX.\n\nRELATIONSHIP TO DECOUPLED \u03bd = 1/3\nLAYERS\n\nAn interesting feature of the parton construction is\nthat it can describe the decoupled \u03bd = 1/3 layered state\nwithin the same framework as the 3D parton state. One\ncan tune from one state to the other by changing a single\ncoupling constant in the parton gauge theory.\nTo see this, let us go back to the original parton\nHamiltonian (8). So far we have analyzed the physics\nof this Hamiltonian in the limit of weak gauge fluctuations: g3 \u226a J3 , tp3 , tp\u22a5 and g\u22a5 \u226a J\u22a5 , tp3 , tp\u22a5 . We found\nthat in this regime, the low energy physics was described\nby the 3D parton state.\n\n\f9\nHowever, by increasing g3 one can also access a regime\nwhere (interlayer) gauge fluctuations are strong. More\nspecifically, suppose that g3 \u226b J3 , tp3 , tp\u22a5 . In this case,\nthe compactness of the U (1) gauge field becomes important: since the lattice electric field is integer valued and\ng3 is large, the interlayer field E3q is essentially fixed at\nE3q = 0. Nonzero values of E3q cost energy of order g3 .\nAs a result, the interlayer tunneling terms Htz(z+1) and\ninterlayer flux terms cos(\u2206i Aqxz,3 \u2212 Aqxz,i + Aqx(z+1),i ) in\n(8) are suppressed, and can be dropped from the Hamiltonian.\nP At low energies, the physics is then described by\nH = z (HzA + Hzt ) - the effective theory for decoupled\n\u03bd = 1/3 states.\nOn an intuitive level, the basic physics is that large\ninterlayer gauge fluctuations prohibit partons from tunneling between the layers, leading to a decoupled layer\nstate. One can also think about the transition between\nthe 3D state and the decoupled layer state in terms of\nHiggs condensation. Consider, for example, the bilayer\ncase. Recall that the interlayer gauge field terms (23) in\nthe bilayer parton Hamiltonian are given by\nH12A =\n\nX g3\nxq\n\n\u2212\n\nX\n\n2\n\nq\n(Ex1,3\n)2\n\nJ3 cos(\u2206i Aqx1,3 \u2212 Aqx1,i + Aqx2,i ) (58)\n\nX.\n\nEDGE (AND SURFACE) STATES\n\nIn this section, we discuss the edge states for the N layer system, both for finite N and in the 3D limit N \u2192\n\u221e.\nFirst, consider the case of finite N . In this case, the\nedge theory can be read off from the K-matrix and charge\nvector t described in section VI, using the standard formalism. [27] The result is a chiral boson theory with\n3N \u2212 2 modes, \u03c6I , I = 1, ..., 3N \u2212 2. The Lagrangian is\nof the form\nL=\n\n1\n(KIJ \u2202t \u03c6I \u2202x \u03c6J \u2212 VIJ \u2202x \u03c6I \u2202x \u03c6J )\n4\u03c0\n\nwhere VIJ is a positive definite velocity matrix which\ndescribes the velocities of each of the modes and the\ndensity-density interactions between different modes.\nQuasiparticle excitations are parameterized by integer\nvectors l and are created by operators of the form\nexp(ilI \u03c6I ). The electric charge corresponding to a quasiparticle l is given by q = e * (tT K \u22121 l).\nAs many aspects of the edge theory depend on microscopic details of the edge and can be affected by edge\nreconstruction, let us discuss two simple quantities which\nare universal. The first quantity - the electric Hall conductance - is given by\n\nxiq\n\n\u03c3xy = (tT K \u22121 t) *\niAqx1,3\n\nas the creation operator\nLet us view the operator e\nq\nof a boson at site x, while Ex1,3\nis the number operator\nwhich measures the number of bosons at site x. The first\nterm is then a potential energy term which describes the\nenergy associated with having a certain number of bosons\non a given site, while the second term is a kinetic energy\nterm which describes a boson hopping from one site to a\nneighboring site. The presence of the combination Aq1,i \u2212\nAq2,i in the argument of the cosine tells us that the boson\nis minimally coupled to the gauge field Aq1,i \u2212 Aq2,i .\nIt is illuminating to think about the strong and weak\ngauge fluctuation regimes in this language. When g3 \u226b\nJ3 , the boson is massive (e.g. in a Mott insulating phase)\nand is therefore irrelevant at low energies. The interlayer\ngauge terms can then be dropped and the low energy effective Hamiltonian (19) consists of two decoupled layers,\nP\nH = 2z=1 (Hzt + HzA ). The ground state is thus two\ndecoupled \u03bd = 1/3 states.\nOn the other hand, when g3 \u226a J3 , the boson condenses. Since the boson is minimally coupled to the\ngauge field Aq1,i \u2212 Aq2,i , this boson condensation is a kind\nof Higgs condensation where the Higgs boson is coupled\nto a Chern-Simons gauge field. [32] When such a Higgs\nboson condenses, the result is another gapped FQH state\n- in this case, the bilayer parton state.\nBecause one can tune from the decoupled state to the\nparton state by changing a single coupling constant g3 ,\none can speculate that these states are in some sense\nneighboring or proximate phases. This is one of the reasons that we propose the parton state as a candidate for\nan intermediate tunneling phase.\n\n(59)\n\nN e2\ne2\n=\nh\n3h\n\n(60)\n\nOf course, this is exactly what we expect since the parton\nstate has \u03bd = 1/3 per layer.\nA more interesting quantity is the thermal Hall conductance. Recall that each chiral boson edge mode gives\n\u03c0 2 k2\na contribution of \u00b1 3hB T to the thermal Hall conductance, with the sign determined by the chirality of the\nmode. Thus, the thermal Hall conductance can be computed by counting the number of edge modes. Since the\nK-matrix has 3N \u22122 positive eigenvalues and no negative\neigenvalues, there are 3N \u2212 2 modes propagating in one\ndirection and no modes propagating in the opposite direction. We conclude that\nthe thermal Hall conductance\n\u03c0 2 k2\nis 3N \u2212 2 (in units of 3hB T ).\nBefore concluding this section, let us briefly discuss\nthe 3D limit, N \u2192 \u221e. In this case, the boundary is\ntwo-dimensional, and the edge states are actually surface states. Let us focus on the most interesting kind\nof boundary: a boundary in the xz plane (with layers\noriented in the xy plane).\nThe analysis of the surface states is complicated by the\nfact that the bulk has gapless modes. Because of this, we\nwill not analyze the surface in detail, but rather sketch\nthe basic qualitative picture which is evident in mean\nfield theory. In mean field theory, the surface modes are\ngiven by 3 species of non-interacting 2D fermions, which\nare chiral in the x direction but non-chiral in the z direction. The modes form a \"sheath\" of chiral fermions with\nFermi surface kx \u223c tz cos(kz a). [1] When one goes beyond mean field theory and includes gauge fluctuations,\nthese fermions will become minimally coupled to the bulk\n\"photon\" mode. The gauge fluctuations will certainly\n\n\f10\naffect the surface theory; however, we know that they\ncannot gap out the surface modes entirely. Indeed, the\ngaplessness of the edge modes is protected by the nonzero\nelectric Hall conductivity in the bulk (e2 /3h per layer).\nThe surface sheath therefore resembles a chiral analog\nof the Halperin-Lee-Read state [28] which is protected\nagainst gap-forming instabilities by the topological character of the bulk phase.\nThese surface states may provide the simplest experimental signature of the 3D parton states. In particular,\nconsider the z-axis surface longitudinal conductance \u03c3zz .\nIn mean field theory, \u03c3zz behaves just like the conductance of the layered integer quantum Hall system studied\nin [1]. Thus, \u03c3zz \u223c const. as T \u2192 0. Including gauge\nfluctuations, we expect that this constant will be renormalized, but \u03c3zz will remain finite at zero temperature.\nThis should be contrasted with the behavior of \u03c3zz in the\ndecoupled \u03bd = 1/3 Laughlin state. In that case \u03c3zz \u223c T 3\nas T \u2192 0. [1] Thus, a measurement of \u03c3zz could, in principle, distinguish the 3D parton state from the decoupled\nLaughlin state.\nXI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper, we have constructed a candidate state\nfor a multilayer FQH system with average filling \u03bd = 1/3\nper layer. We have proposed that the state may be realized in the \"intermediate tunneling regime\" where the\ninterlayer tunneling strength is of the same order as the\nCoulomb energy e2 /lB . Our construction is based on a\nslave particle approach, known as the \"parton construction.\"\nWe have analyzed the state for both a finite number\nof layers N , and in the 3D limit, N \u2192 \u221e. In the case of\na finite number of layers N , the state is a gapped FQH\nstate and is described by a (3N \u22122)\u00d7(3N \u22122) K-matrix.\nIts quasiparticle excitations are anyonic and carry charge\ne/3.\nIn the 3D limit, N \u2192 \u221e, the state is more unusual. It\nsupports two types of excitations: gapped e/3 fermionic\nquasiparticle excitations and gapless neutral collective\nmodes. The quasiparticle excitations are truly 3D quasiparticles and can propagate freely both within and between layers. (This is in contrast to the charge e/3 excitations in the multilayer Laughlin state, which are confined to individual layers). The gapless neutral collective\nmodes are emergent \"photon\" modes originating from\n\n[1] L. Balents and M. P. Fisher, Phys. Rev. Lett. 76, 2782\n(1996).\n[2] R. B. Laughlin, Phys. Rev.

Unlike Maxwell photons, they come in only one polarization, and have an\nanisotropic dispersion \u03c9k2 \u223c k2\u22a5 + kz4 . The e/3 fermionic\nquasiparticles are minimally coupled to these \"photon\"\nmodes so that they have long range interactions.\nThe edge physics of the finite layer and 3D systems\nis also interesting. When N is finite, the edge theory is\ndescribed by a conformal field theory with 3N \u2212 2 chiral\nboson modes. In the 3D limit, the edge modes are more\ncomplex. In mean field theory, the edge (or more accurately, surface) modes are described by three different\nspecies of non-interacting 2D fermions which propagate\nchirally in the x-direction (e.g. the direction parallel to\nthe layers) and non-chirally in the z direction (e.g. the direction perpendicular to the layers). Going beyond mean\nfield theory, we expect that these fermions are minimally\ncoupled to the gapless bulk \"photon\" modes. However,\nwe have not analyzed the surface physics in detail. This\nis an interesting direction for future research.\nAnother direction for future research would be to construct other types of layered FQH states. For example, it\nwould be interesting to build multilayer states with average filling \u03bd = 1/2 per layer - in particular, multilayer\nstates which are related to the Moore-Read \u03bd = 1/2\nstate [33] or the composite Fermi liquid \u03bd = 1/2 state\n[28] (instead of the Laughlin \u03bd = 1/3 state which we\nhave investigated here). One possible approach for this\nproblem would be to employ a parton construction where\none writes an electron as c = d1 d2 f , where d1 , d2 are\nfermionic partons carrying charge e/2 and f is a neutral\nfermionic parton. One could then consider mean field\nstates where, in each layer, d1 , d2 are in integer quantum\nHall states and f is in a p + ip superconducting state or\na Fermi liquid state. In this way, one may be able to\nconstruct multilayer and 3D relatives of the Moore-Read\nor composite Fermi liquid states.\nIn general, there are clearly many possibilities for 3D\nmultilayer FQH states, most of which have not been explored. We hope that the parton construction provides\na useful tool for constructing and analyzing these new\nstates of matter.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis research was supported by the Microsoft Corporation and by NSF grant DMR-05-29399.\n\nPhys.
