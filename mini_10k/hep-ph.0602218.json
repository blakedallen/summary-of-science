Since Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is an asymptotically free theory [2], it was argued that the extremely\ncompressed matter found in neutron stars consists of quarks rather than of hadrons and that realistic calculations\nin the framework of QCD become possible [3]. At high baryon densities and sufficiently low temperatures, however,\na phase transition between normal and color-superconducting quark matter is expected [4, 5, 6, 7]. Therefore,\ncolor superconductivity (CSC) may be relevant to explain several important aspects of the highly compressed matter\npresent in compact stars, e.g., the cooling rates [8], and the rotational properties of stars [9]. Nevertheless, trustworthy\nperturbative calculations can only be performed for ultra-high chemical potentials, \u03bc \u226b \u039bQCD . The weak-coupling\nexpansion of the temperature for the diquark pairing instability reads [10, 11]\n\u221a\nTc\n\u03c02 + 4\n3\u03c0 2\n2048 2\u03c0 3\n\u221a\nln\n+\u03b3\u2212\n= \u2212 \u221a + ln\n+ O(g) ,\n(1)\n\u03bc\n8\n2g\n9 3g 5\nwhere g is QCD running coupling constant at the chemical potential \u03bc, and \u03b3 is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. The\nenergy gap at T = 0 in the CFL phase is [6]\n1\n\n\u2206(0) = 2\u2212 3 \u03c0e\u2212\u03b3 Tc .\n\n(2)\n\nIt follows from the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory of CSC in weak coupling that the phase transition is of second\norder at Tc and the GL parameter is [12]\ns\n72\u03c0 3 Tc\n,\n(3)\n\u03ba=\n7\u03b6(3)\u03b1s \u03bc\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress:\naddress:\n\u2021 Electronic address:\n\u00a7 Electronic address:\n\u00b6 Electronic address:\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nj.noronha@figss.uni-frankfurt.de\nren@summit.rockefeller.edu\ngiannak@summit.rockefeller.edu\nhdf@iopp.ccnu.edu.cn\ndrischke@th.physik.uni-frankfurt.de\n\n\f2\nwith \u03b1s = g 2 /(4\u03c0). When g \u2192 0 then \u03ba \u2192 0 and, therefore, the CFL color superconductor is of extreme type I.\nIt is well known in the context of electronic superconductors that gauge-field fluctuations change the second-order\nphase transition into a first-order transition [13]. However, the strength of this first-order transition is sensitive to\nthe relationship among the three length scales that are involved: the coherence length near the transition, \u03be, the\nmagnetic penetration depth near the transition, \u03bb, and the coherence length at T = 0, \u03be0 \u223c T1c . A superconductor\nwith \u03bb \u226b \u03be0 is said to be in the London limit. In this case, the coupling between the gauge field and the order\nparameter is approximately local. The opposite case, \u03bb \u226a \u03be0 , corresponds to the Pippard limit and the coupling\nbecomes highly nonlocal [14]. For a type-I electronic superconductor the Pippard limit is always realized at T = 0.\nAs the temperature is raised towards the transition to normal quark matter, the penetration depth increases and so\ndoes the ratio \u03bb/\u03be0 . A crossover from the Pippard limit to the London limit would be expected if the transition is of\nsecond order. How does the first-order phase transition induced by gauge-field fluctuations change this scenario? Are\nboth limits still realized? In the case of known electronic superconductors of type I, the first-order phase transition\nis sufficiently weak to warrant a crossover between Pippard and London limits, which has been indeed observed\nexperimentally for strong type-I materials like aluminum [15]. However, the situation is completely different for a\ncolor superconductor. It was shown in a previous work [16] that \u03bb \u226a \u03be0 is maintained at the phase transition for\nasymptotically high baryon density. As will be shown below, this feature remains valid when the results of Ref. [16]\nare extrapolated to moderately high densities.\nThe current work, which is an extension and continuation of the previous project [16], is organized as follows. In\nthe next section, we shall review the generalized GL free energy derived previously. The relevant thermodynamic\nquantities of the first-order color-superconducting transition will be calculated in weak coupling in Sec. III and the\nextrapolation of the results to moderate coupling will be presented in Sec. IV. Concluding remarks will then be given\nin Sec. V. Moreover, technical details on the derivation of the generalized GL free energy, which were skipped in Ref.\n[16], will be sketched in the appendix. In contrast to Ref. [16], the zero-temperature coherence length will be defined\nas \u03be0 = 1/(2\u03c0Tc). Our units are h\u0304 = c = kB = 1 and 4-vectors are denoted by capital letters, K \u2261 K \u03bc = (\u03c9, ~k). In\nour formulas, Tr indicates the summation over all indices including momentum, ~k, and energy, \u03c9, while tr denotes\nthe summation over all indices except momentum and energy.\nII.\n\nTHE GENERALIZED GINZBURG-LANDAU FREE ENERGY\n\nThe CJT effective potential [6] reads\n\u0393[D\u0304, S\u0304] =\n\nT \b\nTr ln D\u0304\u22121 + Tr(D\u22121 D\u0304 \u2212 1) \u2212 Tr ln S\u0304 \u22121 \u2212 Tr(S \u22121 S\u0304 \u2212 1) \u2212 2 \u03932 [D\u0304, S\u0304]\n2\u03a9\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03a9 denotes the 3-volume of the system, D\u0304 and S\u0304 are the full gluon and quark propagators, D\u22121 and S \u22121 are\nthe corresponding inverse tree-level propagators, and \u03932 is the sum of all two-particle irreducible vacuum diagrams.\nWe work in the two-loop approximation, i.e., \u03932 contains only the diagrams shown in Fig. 1. The first diagram,\ncontaining quark propagators, leads to a term of order g 2 \u03bc4 in \u0393, while the other two diagrams, containing only gluon\npropagators, lead to terms proportional to powers of T . Therefore, at small temperatures T \u223c Tc \u223c \u03bc exp(\u22121/g), one\ncan drop the last two diagrams and restrict the consideration to the first. In explicit form,\n1\n \u0304 ,\n\u03932 [D\u0304, S\u0304] = \u2212 Tr{D\u0304 \u03a0[S]}\n2\n\n(5)\n\nwhere\n \u0304 \u2261\n\u03a0[S]\n\n1\nTr(\u0393\u0302 S\u0304 \u0393\u0302 S\u0304)\n2\n\n(6)\n\nis a functional of the full quark propagator S\u0304 and the bare quark-gluon vertex \u0393\u0302. Note that the trace in Eq. (5) is\nover momenta, as well as Lorentz and adjoint color indices, while in Eq. (6) it is over momenta, as well Dirac, flavor,\nand fundamental color indices. The minus sign in Eq. (5) takes account of the fermion loop and the factor 1/2 is due\nto the fact that this is a second-order correction to the CJT effective potential. The factor 1/2 in Eq. (6) accounts\nfor the doubling of the fermionic degrees of freedom in Nambu-Gor'kov space.\nThe free energy is given by the CJT effective potential at its stationary points, determined by\n\u03b4\u0393\n\u03b4 D\u0304\n\n=0,\nD\u0304=D,S\u0304=S\n\n\u03b4\u0393\n\u03b4 S\u0304\n\n=0.\nD\u0304=D,S\u0304=S\n\n(7)\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 1: The two-loop approximation to \u03932 . Straight lines denote quark propagators, wavy lines denote gluon propagators.\n\nThe first condition gives a Dyson-Schwinger equation for the gluon propagator,\nD\u22121 = D\u22121 + \u03a0[S] .\n\n(8)\n\nOne now sees that, at the stationary point, the second term in Eq. (4) cancels the last term,\n\u0393[D, S] =\n\n\u0003\nT \u0002\nTr ln D\u22121 \u2212 Tr ln S \u22121 \u2212 Tr(S \u22121 S \u2212 1) .\n2\u03a9\n\n(9)\n\nIn terms of the gluon and quark propagators in the normal phase, Dn (K) and Sn (K), the propagators in the superconducting phase are written as\nS(K) = Sn (K) + \u03b4S(K, \u2206) ,\nD (K) = Dn\u22121 (K) + \u03b4\u03a0(K, \u2206) ,\n\u22121\n\n(10a)\n(10b)\n\nwhere \u03b4\u03a0 \u2261 \u03a0 \u2212 \u03a0n , i.e., Dn\u22121 already contains the hard-dense-loop (HDL) resummed gluon self-energy \u03a0n . The\ngluon self-energy in the superconducting phase, \u03a0, depends on the superconducting gap parameter, \u2206, and so \u03b4\u03a0 also\ndepends on \u2206. Similarly, the quark propagator in the normal phase Sn contains quark self-energy corrections, and\n\u03b4S depends on \u2206.\nInserting Eqs. (10) into Eq. (9), we obtain\n\u0393 = \u0393n + \u0393cond + \u0393fluc + \u0393\u2032fluc ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere\n\u0003\nT \u0002\nTr ln Dn\u22121 \u2212 Tr ln Sn\u22121 \u2212 Tr(S \u22121 Sn \u2212 1) ,\n2\u03a9\n\u0003\nT \u0002\nTr(Dn \u03b4\u03a0) \u2212 Tr(S \u22121 \u03b4S) + Tr ln(1 + Sn\u22121 \u03b4S) ,\n=\n2\u03a9\nT X\n=\ntr {ln [1 + Dn (K)\u03b4\u03a0(K, \u2206)] \u2212 Dn (K)\u03b4\u03a0(K, \u2206)} ,\n2\u03a9\n\n\u0393n =\n\u0393cond\n\u0393fluc\n\n(12a)\n(12b)\n(12c)\n\n~\nk,\u03c9=0\n\n\u0393\u2032fluc =\n\nT X\ntr {ln [1 + Dn (K)\u03b4\u03a0(K, \u2206)] \u2212 Dn (K)\u03b4\u03a0(K, \u2206)} .\n2\u03a9\n\n(12d)\n\n~\nk,\u03c96=0\n\nThe generalized GL free energy is the difference in the CJT effective potential between the superconducting phase\nand the normal phase, \u0393 \u2212 \u0393n . It includes both the ordinary GL terms and the fluctuation terms. Note that we\nhave added a term Tr(Dn \u03b4\u03a0) in \u0393cond and simultaneously subtracted it in \u0393fluc , \u0393\u2032fluc . This term corresponds to the\nso-called exchange (free) energy [17] and must be present in order to obtain the correct expression for \u0393cond [18, 19].\nTherefore, we have to subtract it in the fluctuation part of the free energy. Only with this subtraction, \u0393fluc + \u0393\u2032fluc\nrepresents the well-known plasmon ring resummation [17]. We note in passing that it is quite gratifying to see that\nthe CJT formalism naturally contains all these different many-body contributions to the free energy.\nIn Ref. [20], the exchange energy was not subtracted from the plasmon ring contribution. This leads to an overall\nchange of sign of the fluctuation energy. As shown below [see Eq. (19)], the contribution of the fluctuation energy is\n\n\f4\n\u223c ln(1 + u) \u2212 u, which is always negative, while in Ref. [20] it is \u223c ln(1 + u) which is positive (for u > 0). Therefore,\nthe authors of Ref. [20] concluded that gauge-field fluctuations raise the free energy of the color-superconducting\nphase, and thus decrease the transition temperature to the normal phase. In our case, however, the gauge-field\nfluctuations decrease the free energy, i.e., stabilize the color-superconducting phase and therefore lead to a larger\ntransition temperature.\nThis is physically plausible if one remembers that gauge-field fluctuations are also present in the normal phase,\nnamely in the first term in Eq. (12a). Since transverse gluons are massless in the normal phase, \u03a0n (0) = 0, longwavelength fluctuations are enhanced over those in the color-superconducting phase where gluons are massive, \u03b4\u03a0 6= 0.\nThus, the fluctuation energy in the normal phase is larger than in the superconducting phase.\nAs shown in the appendix, the weak-coupling approximation gives rise to [18, 19]\n\u0393cond =\n\n6\u03bc2\n21\u03b6(3)\nt \u22062 (T ) +\n\u03c02\n4\u03c0 4\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bc\nTc\n\n\u00132\n\n\u22064 (T ),\n\n(13)\n\nwhere Tc is determined up to the accuracy of Eq.

One can check that the\nquadratic and quartic coefficients of \u0393cond for CSC are, respectively, 12 (= 8 \u00d7 12 + 22 ) and 24 (= 8 \u00d7 14 + 24 ) times\nlarger than those for an electronic superconductor.

[20]. First, since in their treatment the term \u2212m2 (T, k)/k 2 in Eq. (14), which arises from the subtraction of\nthe exchange energy, is missing, their formal power-series expansion for the fluctuation energy in terms of \u2206 starts\nalready at quadratic order. This then gives rise to a renormalized critical temperature Tc\u2032 . When including the term\nin question, there is no such renormalization of Tc . Nevertheless, the difference between Tc and Tc\u2032 is of order O(g 2 ),\nand the two-loop approximation employed in the derivation of Eq. (18) is not sufficiently accurate to provide all\ncorrections of this order. Furthermore, the authors of Ref. [20] approximated the momentum-dependent Meissner\nmass by a constant and simply cut off the momentum integration in Eq. (14). In that case, one is effectively in the\nLondon limit of Eqs. (17) and (19), where the fluctuation energy is of the form of Eq. (21). The shift in the transition\ntemperature compared to that of Eq. (1) is then only of order O(g 2 ) [20], and not of order O(g), as found here and\nin Ref. [16].\nIII.\n\nTHE FIRST-ORDER CSC TRANSITION IN WEAK COUPLING\n\nA generic first-order phase transition can be described by three characteristic temperatures: the transition temperature Tc\u2217 , the maximum temperature of the (metastable) superheated superphase Tsh , and the minimum temperature\nof the (metastable) supercooled normal phase Tsc , respectively. These temperatures are related in the following way,\nTsc < Tc\u2217 < Tsh ,\n\n(24)\n\nand they can be obtained from the generalized GL free energy (18). The lower margin of a supercooled normal phase\ncorresponds to\n\u22022\u0393\n\u2202\u22062\n\n= 0,\n\n(25)\n\n\u2206=0\n\nand, using Eq. (18), we have\nTsc = Tc ,\n\n(26)\n\nwhich relates Tsc with the onset temperature for diquark pairing. On the other hand, the transition occurs at\n\u2202\u0393\n=0,\n\u2202\u2206\n\n\u0393=0,\n\n(27)\n\nfor a value of \u2206 \u2261 \u2206c\u2217 6= 0. This implies that\n\u0013\n\u0012\n7\u03b6(3) \u22062c\u2217\n7\u03b6(3) 2 \u2032 \u03be02\n=0,\n+\ng\nF\n4\u03c0 2 Tc2\n18\u03c0 3\n\u03bb2c\u2217\n\u0012 2 \u0013\n7\u03b6(3) \u22062c\u2217\n7\u03b6(3) 2 \u03bb2c\u2217\n\u03be0\n+\n=0.\n+\ng\nF\n8\u03c0 2 Tc2\n18\u03c0 3\n\u03be02\n\u03bb2c\u2217\n\nt\u2217c +\nt\u2217c\n\n(28)\n\nEliminating t\u2217c in the equations above we have\nF\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03be02\n\u03bb2c\u2217\n\n\u0013\n\n216\u03c0 7\n=\n7\u03b6(3)g 4\n\n\u0012\n\nTc\n\u03bc\n\n\u00132\n\n,\n\n(29)\n\nwhere F (z) = \u2212F \u2032 (z)/z + F (z)/z 2 . Solving Eq. (29) for \u22062c\u2217 , with the aid of Eq. (23), we obtain\n\u22062c\u2217 =\n\n\u03c02\ng 2 Tc2 .\n63\u03b6(3)\n\n(30)\n\n\f6\nThe transition temperature is obtained substituting Eq. (30) into either one of Eqs. (28), which produces\n\u0010\n\u03c02 \u0011\nTc\u2217 = 1 + \u221a g Tc .\n12 2\n\n(31)\n\nThese were the results reported in Ref. [16]. The penetration depth at the transition is\n1\ng4\n\u03bc2 ,\n=\n\u03bb2c\u2217\n216\u03c0 2\n\n(32)\n\ng 4 \u03bc2\n\u03be02\n=\n\u226b1.\n2\n\u03bbc\u2217\n864\u03c0 4 Tc2\n\n(33)\n\nwhich yields the ratio\n\nThus, the Pippard limit is valid for the entire CSC phase at sufficiently large chemical potentials.\nWe shall proceed to determine Tsh . The free energy \u0393 as a function of \u2206 has a local maximum between \u2206 = 0 and\nthe minimum \u2206c\u2217 at T = Tc\u2217 in the superconducting phase. As T increases, the local minimum remains unchanged\nuntil it coalesces with the local maximum, where\n\u22022\u0393\n=0,\n\u2202\u22062\n\n\u2202\u0393\n=0,\n\u2202\u2206\n\n(34)\n\nfor a value of \u2206 \u2261 \u2206sh 6= 0. It then follows that\ntsh +\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n7\u03b6(3) \u22062sh\n7\u03b6(3) 2 \u2032 \u03be02\n=0,\ng\nF\n+\n4\u03c0 2 Tc2\n18\u03c0 3\n\u03bb2sh\n\u0012 2\u0013\n\u03be0\n432\u03c0 7 \u0010 Tc \u00112\nF \u2032\u2032\n.\n= \u2212\n2\n\u03bbsh\n7\u03b6(3)g 4 \u03bc\n\n(35)\n\nMoreover, Eq. (35) together with Eq. (23) yields\n\u22062sh =\n\n1\n\u03c02\ng 2 Tc2\u2217 = \u22062c\u2217 .\n126\u03b6(3)\n2\n\n(36)\n\nSubtracting the first equation in Eq. (28) from Eq. (35) and using (23), we find that\ntsh \u2212 t\u2217c =\n\ng2\n(1 \u2212 ln 2) ,\n72\n\n(37)\n\nand as a result\n\u0015\n\u0014\ng2\nTsh = 1 + (1 \u2212 ln 2) Tc\u2217 .\n72\n\n(38)\n\nNote that Tc\u2217 is one order of g closer to Tsh than to Tsc . The ratio\n\u03be02\ng 4 \u03bc2\n=\n2\n\u03bbsh\n1728\u03c0 4Tc2\n\n(39)\n\nimplies that even the metastable CSC state is in the Pippard limit in weak coupling. Although the diagrammatics\nbehind the generalized GL free energy function (18) determine Tc only up to subleading order, the leading-order\ndifferences among the three characteristic temperatures do not change if higher-order corrections to Tc are included.\nAnother observable associated with the first-order phase transition is the latent heat L = Tc \u2206S, where \u2206S is the\nchange in entropy density at the transition. We have\n\u2206S = \u2212\nand as a result\nL=\n\n\u0010 \u2202\u0393 \u0011\n\u2202T\n\n\u2206=\u2206\u2217\nc\n\n=\n\n2g 2 2\n\u03bc Tc ,\n21\u03b6(3)\n\n2g 2 2 2 6\u03bc2 2\n\u03bc Tc \u2261 2 \u2206c\u2217 .\n21\u03b6(3)\n\u03c0\n\n(40)\n\n(41)\n\n\f7\n\n25\nTsc = Tc\nTc* (analytical)\nTc* (numerical)\nTsh\n\nTc (MeV)\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n\u03bc (MeV)\nFIG. 2: Comparison between the different temperatures involved in the discussion of the fluctuation-induced first-order phase\ntransition.\n\nNow we calculate the strength of the first-order phase transition as was defined in Ref. [13],\ntHLM =\n\nL\n,\n\u2206cv\n\n(42)\n\nwhere \u2206cv is the jump in specific heat at the second-order phase transition, ignoring the fluctuations. If we ignore\nthe third term in Eq. (18) we recover the ordinary GL theory from which we find \u2206cv = 24\u03bc2 Tc /[7\u03b6(3)]. Thus, we\nhave\ntHLM\ng2\n=\n.\nTc\n36\n\n(43)\n\nNote that Eq. (43) implies that the strength of the first-order phase transition weakens (logarithmically) with increasing chemical potential, which is in agreement with the fact that the second-order phase transition is recovered\nat asymptotically large densities. Note that for electronic superconductors, tHLM /Tc \u223c 10\u22126 [13] which, for realistic\nvalues of g \u223c 1 is much smaller than the right-hand side of Eq. (43).\nIV.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nStrictly speaking, the weak-coupling results in the previous section are only valid at ultra-high baryon densities\nsuch that \u03bc \u226b \u039bQCD . For quark matter that may exist inside a compact star \u03bc is expected to be slightly higher\nthan \u039bQCD , and then the weak-coupling expansion becomes problematic. Nevertheless, we shall assume that the\ngeneralized GL free energy remains numerically reliable down to realistic quark densities. Even though this is not the\ncase, the qualitative statement for the absence of the London limit in CSC may still survive, due to the reason given\nat the end of this section.\nWe solved Eq. (29) and the second equation in Eq. (35) numerically in order to find \u2206c\u2217 and \u2206sh as functions\nof the chemical potential. The transition temperature Tc\u2217 is obtained using \u2206c\u2217 in either one of Eqs. (28) and the\ntemperature Tsh is obtained from the first equation in Eq. (35).

[16]. Note that Tc\u2217 is still closer to Tsh than to Tsc down to few hundreds of\nMeV. A comparison between the numerically evaluated critical temperature Tc\u2217 and Tc is shown in Fig. 3 (a) and the\ndiscontinuity of the gap at Tc\u2217 , relative to its value at T = 0, (2), is shown in Fig. 3 (b) [23].

From Fig. 4 we see that the ratio \u03be0 /\u03bbc\u2217 \u226b 1, meaning that only\nthe Pippard limit of magnetic interactions is present in color superconductivity. Even for the minimum value of the\nratio \u03be0 /\u03bbc\u2217 , which is around \u03bc = 700 MeV, the Pippard expansion of m2 (k, T ) in Eq. (22) works better than the\nLondon expansion, displayed in Eq. (20). This is also the case for the metastable CSC state up to Tsh , as is shown in\nFig. 5.\nIt is instructive to express the right-hand side of Eq. (29) in terms of the GL parameter (3) and compare it with\nthe corresponding equation for a metallic superconductor, whose generalized GL free energy was given in Ref.

In other words, the London limit is more likely to be realized\nin metallic superconductors.\nV.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nIn this paper we have systematically calculated the effects of gauge-field fluctuations on the free energy of a\nhomogeneous CFL color superconductor in the Hartree-Fock approximation. We evaluated both analytically and\nnumerically the temperature of the fluctuation-induced first-order phase transition, the latent heat, as well as the\nmaximum temperature of a superheated superphase. It was also shown that the London limit for color-magnetic\ninteractions in CFL color superconductors is absent. As the main reason we identified the weakness of electromagnetic\ninteractions in comparison to strong interactions, \u03b1e \u226a \u03b1s . Thus, one can say that once the gauge-field fluctuations\nare taken into account, the local-coupling approximation between the order parameter and the gauge fields is not\nvalid in the CFL phase.\nBy using an inhomogeneous GL theory, Iida and Baym [24] investigated the formation of vortices and supercurrents\ninduced by external magnetic fields and rotation in pairing states near the critical temperature. Since they used a\n\n\f10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\n9\n\n10\n2\n\n8\n\n10\n\n\u03be0/\u03bbsh\n\n\u03be0/\u03bbsh\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n7\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n0\n\n2e+14\n\n4e+14\n\n6e+14\n\n8e+14\n\n1e+15\n\n\u03bc (MeV)\nFIG. 5: (a) \u03be0 /\u03bbsh at small chemical potentials. (b) The same ratio at very large chemical potentials.\n\nmean-field approximation, all gauge fields were regarded as averaged quantities and fluctuations around their mean\nvalues were not considered. In order to see how the inclusion of fluctuations would change their results one has to\nderive an effective action that depends only on the order parameter and the gauge fields. This action would display\nnon-local interactions between the gauge fields and the diquark condensate. Such an effective action could be obtained\nusing the formalism developed in Ref. [25].\nIt was shown in Ref. [13], by a one-loop renormalization-group calculation using the \u01eb expansion, that no stable\ninfrared fixed point can exist for a theory involving local interactions between abelian gauge fields and order parameters, unless the number of order parameter components, N , is artificially extended to N > Nc = 365, which is\nfar beyond the case of relevance for electronic superconductivity. This is then interpreted as signaling the presence\nof a first-order transition. Therefore, for electronic superconductors, gauge-field fluctuations are always expected to\nchange the order of the phase transition to first order, irrespective of further details about the transition. For color\nsuperconductors the effective action containing only the order parameter and the gauge fields as well as the specific\nform of their interactions is not known, and the general result derived in Ref. [13] may not be applicable. However,\nthe results we obtained for the CFL phase seem to suggest that fluctuation-induced first-order phase transitions are\nindeed present in color superconductivity. Furthermore, due to the absence of the London limit, we expect that, once\ngauge-field fluctuations and first-order phase transitions are taken into account, local diquark-gluon interactions are\nnever realized in color superconductors, regardless which phase is considered. This would constitute a striking new\nphysical effect that would only come about in color superconductivity. In fact, the crossover from nonlocal to local\ninteractions near the critical temperature in superconducting metals of strong type I has been recently observed [15].\nWhat we found in this paper rules out the possibility of observing such a crossover in color superconductors.\nRecently, a GL free energy that takes into account the effects of nonzero quark masses and charge neutrality has\nbeen derived within the mean-field approximation [26]. A study on the validity of local diquark-gluon interactions in\nthis case and the effects of gauge-field fluctuations on the phase diagram obtained in Ref. [26] is in progress and will\nbe reported elsewhere [27].\n\n\f11\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank H.-J. Drescher, T. Hatsuda, J. Hostler, K. Iida, H. Malekzadeh, P. Reuter, and I.

(18), in terms of Feynman diagrams.

The symbol \"\u2248\" in the gluon propagator means that we used the\napproximation for the total HDL gluon propagator that is relevant for the CSC energy scale.\nDiagrammatically, Dn is denoted by a wavy line, Sn is represented by a thick line, and the CSC correction to the\ninverse quark propagator (A1b) is associated with a two-point vertex bearing a cross. The corresponding diagrammatic\nexpansions for \u03b4S and \u03b4\u03a0 are\n\nIn weak coupling we expand Sn as\n\n\f12\nExpanding \u0393cond up to the fourth power of \u03c6(P ) we find\n\nwhere the weak-coupling approximation has been employed in order\nP to retain the diagrams with at most one HDL\ngluon line. The diagram bearing two crosses yields the expression P P \u2032 \u03a6(P )K(P |P \u2032 )\u03a6(P \u2032 ), where the kernel K(P |P \u2032 )\nis isomorphic to the kernel in the Dyson-Schwinger equation for the diquark scattering amplitude in the normal phase.\nMoreover, taking \u03a6(P ) to be proportional to the pairing mode, i.e.,\n\u03c6(P ) = \u2206 sin\n\nh\n\n\u0010 1 \u0011i\ng\n\u221a ln\n,\n\u03bd\u0302\n3 2\u03c0\n\n(A2)\n\nwhere \u2206 is the energy gap, \u03bd\u0302 = (3/2)5/2 g 5 \u03bd/(256\u03c0 4 \u03bc), we have that\n\nis proportional to T \u2212 Tc , with Tc determined up to subleading order in g [see Eq. (1)]. For the diagrams with four\ncrosses the same mechanism yields\n\nat T = Tc , which reduces the number of quartic terms in \u0393cond . Moreover, it will be shown at the end of this appendix\nthat the following two diagrams\n\n(A3)\nare of higher order in weak coupling and can be dropped. For \u0393cond we end up with\n\nwhich produces the terms in Eq. (13). Now we treat the fluctuation terms \u0393fluc + \u0393\u2032fluc , whose diagrammatic\nrepresentation is\n\n(A4)\n\n\f13\nwhere \u0393fluc includes only the contribution from the static gluons and \u0393\u2032fluc contains remaining contributions. Due to\nthe Meissner effect, the shaded bubble does not vanish when the spatial momentum of the gluon line goes to zero at\nzero Matsubara energy. A resummation of all ring diagrams in Eq. (A4) is necessary for \u0393fluc and the result is the\nright-hand side of Eq. (14). Regarding \u0393\u2032fluc , where the Matsubara energy of the gluon line is nonzero, dynamical\nscreening prevents an infrared divergence for the integral over gluon momentum. In weak coupling \u0393\u2032fluc is dominated\nby the first diagram in Eq. (A4), which is again of higher order. Therefore, the contribution of \u0393\u2032fluc can be safely\nneglected.\nNow we present the argument supporting our assertion that the two diagrams in Eq. (A3) and the first diagram in\n\u0393\u2032fluc can be neglected in weak coupling. Let us denote the contribution of the first diagram in Eq. (A3) by c1 \u22064 . It\nconsists of five free quark propagators with four-momentum (\u03bd, ~p) and a self-energy insertion \u03a3(P ) \u223c g 2 \u03bd ln (\u03bc/|\u03bd|) \u223c\ng\u03bd. The main contribution to the p~-integration comes from a shell of thickness \u223c |\u03bd| around the Fermi surface and\nthen we have\n\nc 1 \u223c \u03bc2 T\n\nX 1\n\u03bc2\n\u03a3(\u03bd)\n\u223c\ng\n,\n|\u03bd|4\nTc2\n\u03bd\n\n(A5)\n\nwhich is of O(g) in comparison to the quartic term in Eq. (13). The contribution of the second diagram in Eq. (A3),\ndenoted by c2 \u22064 , can be estimated similarly. As is the case with the gap equation, the dominating contribution\ncomes from the magnetic gluons with nonzero Matsubara energy. The integration for the quark propagators over the\nmagnitude of their momenta p~, p~ \u2032 , on each side of the gluon line can be approximately decoupled from the integration\nfor the gluon propagator over the angle between p~ and ~p \u2032 , where the latter produces the forward logarithm. We then\nfind\n\nc 2 \u223c g 2 T 2 \u03bc4\n\n1\n1\nln\n2 \u03bd \u20322 \u03bc2\n\u03bd\n\u2032\n\nX\n\n\u03bd6=\u03bd\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bc\n\u03bd \u2212 \u03bd\u2032\n\n\u0013\n\n\u223cg\n\n\u03bc2\n,\nTc2\n\n(A6)\n\nwhich is again of higher order. Now we consider the first diagram in \u0393\u2032fluc and denote its contribution as c3 \u22064 . Since\n2/3\nthe typical momentum for the gluon line is k \u223c mD |\u03c9|1/3 \u226b \u03c9 and \u03c9 \u223c Tc , each bubble can be approximated by the\nstatic magnetic self-energy of gluons at the Pippard limit, i.e.,\n\n4\n\nc3 \u223c g T\n\nXZ\n\n\u03c96=0\n\n1\nd3~k\n3\n\u03c0\n2\n(2\u03c0) (k + m2 |\u03c9| )2\n4 D k\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bc2 T c\nTc2 k\n\nThe sum over \u03c9 has a cutoff when \u03c9 \u223c mD and then we end up with\nwe have c3 \u223c g \u03bc2 /Tc2 , which is also negligible.\n\n\u00132\n\nP\n\n\u223c\n\ng 4 \u03bc4 X 1\n.\nTc2 m2D\n|\u03c9|\n\n\u03c96=0 |\u03c9|\n\n(A7)\n\n\u03c96=0\n\n\u22121\n\n\u223c ln (\u03bc/Tc ) \u223c 1/g.
