Within the framework of the LSW theory of Ostwald ripening the amount of volume of the second (solid) phase in a liquid solution\nthat is newly formed by recrystallization is investigated. It is shown,\nthat in the late stage, the portion of the newly generated volume formed\nwithin an interval from time t0 to t is a certain function of t/t0 and an\nexplicit expression of this volume is given. To achieve this, we introduce\nthe notion of the return radius r(t, t0 ), which is the unique radius of a\nparticle at time t0 such that this particle has \u2013 after growing and shrinking \u2013 the same radius at time t. We derive a formula for the return radius\nwhich later on is used to obtain the newly formed volume. Moreover,\nformulas for the growth rate of the return radius and the recrystallized\nmaterial at time t0 are derived.\n\n1. Introduction\nRecrystallization of minerals is a combination of simultaneous processes\nof dissolution and precipitation that leads to formation of larger mineral\ncrystals. A driving force of recrystallization in geological environments is\nusually either the difference between lithostatic and hydrostatic pressures or\nthe dependence of the chemical potential of the interface on the grain size.\nThis type of coarsening process, where larger particles are growing at the\nexpense of smaller ones is called Ostwald ripening. A prominent example is\nOstwald ripening of calcite (CaCO3 ) in an aqueous solution, which is subject\nof a number of experimental investigations, see e.g. [5],[7], [3],[10],[2],[1].\nIn these experiments one is interested in the amount of newly formed\ncrystalline material, i.e. the volume of the solid phase present at time t,\nthat has been precipitated from the solution after some time instant t0 < t.\nExperimental methods tending to determine the newly formed material are\nusually proceeding as follows: An isotope of a crystal lattice constituent\nof the mineral \u2013 in case of calcite 45 Ca or 14 C \u2013 is added as a radioactive\ntracer to the solution at time t0 . The isotope concentration in the solution is\nmonitored during the experiment, and changes of the isotope concentration\nhappen due to two processes: either it is a diffusion into the crystal, or\nburial in the calcite layers newly formed during recrystallization.\nIn order to derive the amount of newly formed material from the Isotope uptake, in [1],[3],[2] it was argued that the amount of isotope uptake\nis proportional to the newly formed material. However, this approach does\nnot account for the surface changes during ripening. Whenever the surface\nDate: July 6th, 2012.\nKey words and phrases.

The question we were asked by experimentalists was if, and under which conditions, the surface change may be\nneglected or, more precisely, how the influence of surface change compares\nwith the amount of newly formed material concerning the isotope uptake.\nTo answer these questions, a first step is to derive analytical expressions\nboth, for the newly formed volume and for the change of the surface area.\nThe former will be the subject of this paper, while the latter usually may\nbe derived very easily in some mean field theory. We will not attempt to\ndraw conclusions concerning experiments, since this would require too many\ndetails of geochemistry in order to construct a sound mathematical model.\nThis is planned to be done in a forthcoming article. Besides these motivations from experiments, an explicit formula for the newly formed volume\nduring Ostwald Ripening is also interesting from a theoretical point of view\nin order to better understand the long time behavior of the coarsening system.\nIn this paper we are going to calculate the newly formed volume theoretically in the late stage of the coarsening process, assuming that the so called\nLSW theory is valid, see [6], [9]. In this mean field theory, it is assumed,\nthat the grains are spherical particles and the growth kinetics of a grain only\ndepends on its size compared to the size distribution of all particles and not\non the local environment. Moreover it is assumed, that the total volume of\nthe crystallized material is conserved, i.e. large particles grow exclusively at\nthe expense of smaller ones.. A short review of the LSW theory is given in\nthe next section. In Figure 1 we have sketched how the size of particles may\nhave changed from time t0 to t. Note that a particle may grow at time t0\nbut start to shrink at some t1 with t0 < t1 < t leading to R(t) < R(t0 ), see\nFigure 2, where some typical examples of the time evolution R(t) of particle\nradii R, are shown.\n\nR2(t)\n\nR1(t)\n\nR2(t0)\nR1(t0)\n\nR3(t)\n\nR3(t0)\n\nFigure 1. Newly formed solid phase. During Ostwald ripening,\nbigger particles are growing at the expense of smaller ones. Comparing the sizes at time t0 and at time t > t0 , the three possible cases are sketched: R1 (t) > R1 (t0 ), R2 (t) = R2 (t0 ) and\nR3 (t) < R3 (t0 ). Thus at time t > t0 , a certain amount of the\nsolid phase, marked in gray, has been newly formed between time\nt0 and time t.\n\n\fRETURN RADIUS AND VOLUME OF RECRYSTALLIZED MATERIAL\n\n3\n\n12\nt(r)/t0 = 2\nt(r)/t0 = 3\n\n11\n\nt(r)/t = 5\n0\n\nR(t)\n\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n4\nt/t0, t0 = 1000\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFigure 2. Time evolution of the radius R(t) of a spherical particle\nwith different initial conditions R0 = R(t0 ) in the late stage of\nOstwald ripening in the diffusion limited LSW regime as described\nin section 2, with non dimensional critical radius Rc (0) = 1. Since\nin all three cases the initial radius R(t0 ) is larger than the critical\nradius Rc (t0 ), the particles start to grow at the expense of smaller\nparticles. However, after a certain time they start shrinking at the\nexpense of even bigger particles, since the critical radius is also\ngrowing in time. For a particle radius R(t0 ) = R0 being larger\nthan the critical radius at time t0 , there is a return time t(R0 )\nsuch that R(t) = R0 . The other way round, given t > t0 , there is\na unique radius r such that a particle with initial radius R(t0 ) = r\nwill have the same radius at time t, i.e. R(t) = r. This radius\nwill be called the return radius. E.g. for the blue line we observe\nthat R(2t0 ) = R(t0 ), i.e., the return time is t = 2t0 and the return\nradius for t = 2t0 is given by R(t0 ) \u2248 8.42. In fact, we have\ncalculated suitable initial values R(t0 ) for the above cases with our\nmethod described in section 3.\n\nFor an ensemble of particles with radii Ri (t0 ), the newly formed volume\nV\nbetween t0 and t is\nX\n\u0001\n(1)\nV new (t, t0 ) = 34 \u03c0\nRi (t)3 \u2212 Ri (t0 )3 .\nnew (t, t )\n0\n\ni:Ri (t)\u2265Ri (t0 )\n\nNote that due to the assumption of mass conservation of the second phase,\nthe newly formed crystalline material all comes from dissolution of smaller\nparticles. In a mean field picture Ri (t) \u2265 Rj (t) if and only if Ri (t0 ) \u2265\nRj (t0 ). As will be discussed in more details in the next sections, there is a\ncritical radius Rc (t) such that at time t precisely the particles with radius\nR(t) > Rc (t) are growing. However, Rc (t) is growing faster then R(t) and\nparticles that initially grow, start to shrink at later times, see Figure 2.\nThus, there is a unique radius r = r(t, t0 ), such that Ri (t0 ) = Ri (t) if and\nonly if Ri (t0 ) = r. We will call this radius r the return radius and V new (t, t0 )\nmay be expressed as\nX\n\u0001\nRi (t)3 \u2212 Ri (t0 )3 .\n(2)\nV new (t, t0 ) = 34 \u03c0\ni:Ri (t)\u2265r(t,t0 )\n\n\f4\n\nF. HAUSSER AND E. LAKSTHANOV\n\nWe will show in section 3 that in the late stage of Ostwald ripening in the\nLSW regime the return radius r(t, t0 ) is a function of t/t0 and can be easily\ncomputed by inverting an explicitly given function. Moreover we obtain an\nanalytic expression for the growth rate of r(t, t0 ) at t = t0 . This will lead\nin section 4 to our main result: Also the volume V new (t, t0 ) or equivalently\nthe volume fraction \u03a6new (t, t0 ) of the newly formed solid phase within the\ninterval from t0 to t depends on t/t0 and may be calculated by function\ninversion of explicitly given expressions. We also give an explicit expression\nfor the initial rate of the formation of new solid material.\n2. LSW Theory for Ostwald Ripening\nWe will shortly review the main results of the LSW-analysis given in\n[6],[9], for a more detailed description see e.g. [8]. In the following the three\ndimensional model is presented, using the notations of [4], where the two\ndimensional case is discussed. The kinetics of Ostwald Ripening is governed\nby two different processes: the mass transport between the mineral grains\nvia diffusion in the solution and the attachment/detachment process at the\ngrain boundaries. The two limiting kinetic regimes are termed attachment\nlimited (AL) growth \u2013 here diffusion is assumed to be infinitely fast compared\nto the attachment process \u2013 and diffusion limited (DL) growth \u2013 assuming\nthe attachment process to be instantaneous.\nThe first assumption of LSW-theory is, that the volume fraction \u03a6 of the\ndispersed solid phase is very small. Thus it is assumed that the solid phase\nconsists of many disconnected particles far away from each other which\nmoreover are assumed to be spherical and have immobile center. For a\nlarge system, this ensemble of particles may be characterized in terms of a\nparticle radius distribution function F (R,\nR \u221et). The number of particles per\nunit volume is then given by n(t) = 0 F (R, t) dR. Assuming that no\nnucleation and coalescence of particles takes place, F obeys the continuity\nequation\n\u0001\n(3)\n\u2202t F + \u2202R \u1e58F = 0.\nNote that the number of particles n(t) may only change due to radii decreasing to zero in finite time.\nThe second assumption is, that far away from the particles, the chemical\npotential u(x, t), describing the change of energy per change of mass of the\ndissolved material may be approximated by a spatially constant mean field\n\u016b(t). Finally, one assumes that the volume fraction \u03a6 is constant in time.\nThe driving force of Ostwald ripening is the difference between the chemical potential \u016b(t) in the solution and the chemical ueq (R) at the particle\nsurface, depending on the curvature 1/R. From the above assumptions it\nis derived, that the growth rate \u1e58(t) of any particle may be described in\nnon-dimensional form as\nP\n\u00011\nueq (Ri )Ri\nP\n\u016b(t) =\n(DL)\n\u1e58(t) = \u016b(t) \u2212 ueq (R) ,\nRi\nR\nP\n\u0001\nueq (Ri )Ri2\nP 2\n\u1e58(t) = \u016b(t) \u2212 ueq (R) ,\n\u016b(t) =\n(AL).\nRi\n\n\fRETURN RADIUS AND VOLUME OF RECRYSTALLIZED MATERIAL\n\n5\n\nMoreover, assuming the chemical potential at the surface to be given in non\ndimensional form by the Gibbs Thomson law ueq (R) = 1/R, the critical\nradius Rc such that particles with radius R < Rc are shrinking while the\nones with R > Rc are growing is given by\nRc (t) = 1/\u016b(t)\nand the growth law may be written as\n\u0011\n1\n1 \u0010R\n\u2212 1 , \u016b(t) =\n(4)\n\u1e58(t) = 2\nR Rc\nR\n\u0011\n1\u0010R\nR\n\u2212 1 , \u016b(t) =\n(5)\n\u1e58(t) =\nR Rc\nR2\n\n(DL)\n(AL).\n\nIntroducing the new variables\n(6)\n\nz=\n\nR\n,\nRc\n\n\u03c4 = ln(\n\nRc (t)\n),\nRc (0)\n\neqs.

For later use we\nalso point out, that according to (7) the rescaled radius z may be shrinking\nalso for values z > 1, i.e. for growing particles. Actually, as will be seen\nlater, the growth rate dz/d\u03c4 is negative for all particles in the late stage. The\nessential point of the LSW-analysis is, to argue, that \u03bd becomes constant at\nlate times approaching the unique values ([9],[6])\n(9)\n\n\u03bd = 27/4\n\n(DL),\n\n\u03bd=4\n\n(AL).\n\nThis in turn implies a scaling law for the critical\ndifferential equations for Rc (t) given in Eq.

Return radius\nAs has been sketched in the introduction, to calculate the newly formed\nvolume between time t0 and time t we need to calculate what we have called\nthe return radius r = r(t, t0 ), i.e. the unique radius r such that a particle\nwith radius R(t0 ) = r will have the same radius at later time t, R(t) = r.\nIn fact, this amounts to solve a boundary value problem for the differential\nequations (4), (5). We will see, however, that the return radius may be\ncalculated quite easily in the asymptotic regime of LSW, i.e. for t0 large\nenough, without explicitly solving the boundary value problem. Since in the\nfollowing t0 is fixed, we will write r(t) instead of r(t, t0 ).\nWe will use the rescaled coordinates z, \u03c4 as introduced in (6). First note\nthat in the rescaled coordinate z the return radius r does take two different\nvalues at time t0 and at time t, namely z(t0 , r) and z(t, r). We will use the\nnotation \u03c40 = \u03c4 (t0 ), \u03c4 = \u03c4 (t), z0 = z(\u03c40 ) = z(t0 , r), z = z(\u03c4 ) = z(t, r). From\n(6) follows, that r being the return radius is equivalent to\nln z \u2212 ln z0 = \u03c40 \u2212 \u03c4.\n\n(17)\n\nMoreover, the scaling law (10) implies for large t0\nz(t, r)\nRc (t0 ) \u0010 t0 \u0011 \u03b31\nz\n=\n=\n=\n.\n(18)\nz0\nz(t0 , r)\nRc (t)\nt\nThe two identities (17) and (18) uniquely fix the return radius r = r(t, t0 ),\nwhich may be calculated as follows. Since the time dependence of the\nrescaled radius z = z(\u03c4 ) is given by equation (7), we use the explicit solution of \u03c4 (z) given in (11) to express (17) as\n(19)\n\n\u03b1(z) = \u03b1(z0 ),\n\nwith \u03b1(x) = ln x + \u03c4 (x).\n\nSince the return radius has to be larger than the rescaled radius, r \u2265 Rc (t0 ),\nwe may assume z0 = z(t0 , r) \u2265 1. One easily checks that\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2> 0 : z \u2208 (0, 1)\n0\n\u03b1 (z) = 0 : z = 1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n< 0 : z \u2208 (1, zmax )\nand\nlim \u03b1(z) = lim \u03b1(z) = \u2212\u221e.\n\nz\u21920\n\nz\u2192zmax\n\nThus, equation (19) allows for a unique solution for z0 \u2208 [1, zmax ). Denoting\nthis inverse of \u03b1 on (\u2212\u221e, \u03b1(1)] by \u03c8, we may express z = z(t, r) as a function\n\n\f8\n\nF. HAUSSER AND E.

The function \u03c1 has been\nevaluated numerically using bisection.\n\nNow we may calculate the return time t(r) for any initial radius r, i.e.\nthe time t, such that R(t) = R(t0 ) = r.

Volume fraction of recrystallized material\nNow let \u03a6 denote the volume fraction of the solid spherical phase, i.e.\nZ \u221e\n(26)\n\u03a6(t) = 43 \u03c0\nF (R, t)R3 dR\n0\n\n\u03a6new (t, t0 )\n\nand denote by\nthe volume fraction of that part of the solid phase\nat time t that was produced between time t0 and time t through recrystallization.

These particles are precisely the ones for which\nR(t) is larger than the return radius r = r(t, t0 ), or, equivalently, R(t0 ) > r.\nThus \u03a6new (t, t0 ) may be calculated as the difference of the volume fraction\nof all particles being larger than r at time t and the volume fraction of these\n\n\f10\n\nF.

Since F (R, t) = Rc (t)f (z, \u03c4 ) and F (R, t0 ) = Rc (t0 )f (z, \u03c40 ), a\nchange of variables in (27) leads to\n(28)\nZ z(t0 ,r)\nZ z0\nnew\n3\n3\n3\n4\n4\n\u03a6 (t, t0 ) = 3 \u03c0g0 Rc (0)\nh(x)x dx = 3 \u03c0g0 Rc (0)\nh(x)x3 dx,\nz(t,r)\n\n\u03c1(z0 )\n\nwhere the return radius r = r(t, t0 ) may be calculated from equation (21) as\ndescribed in the last section.

Similarly we may express the total\nvolume fraction in the late stage as\nZ zmax\nh(x)x3 dx,\n(29)\n\u03a6(t0 ) = \u03a6(t) = 43 \u03c0g0 Rc (0)3\n0\n\nThus the percentage of the volume of the second phase at time t, that has\nbeen produced by recrystallization between time t0 and time t, is given by\n(30)\nnew\n\n\u03c6(t, t0 ) := \u03a6\n\n(t, t0 )/\u03a6 =\n\n1\nz3\n\nZ\n\nz0\n\n3\n\nh(x)x dx,\n\u03c1(z0 )\n\nz3\n\nZ\n:=\n\nzmax\n\nh(x)x3 dx,\n\n0\n\nand may be easily computed by determining z0 = z(t0 , r) and \u03c1(z0 ) = z(t, r)\nas described in section 3 and using numerical quadrature. Again we point\nout, that \u03c6(t, t0 ) may be expressed as a function of t/t0 , since r(t, t0 ) depends\non t/t0 only.\nIn Figure 7, the specific produced volume \u03c6(t, t0 ) is depicted over the\nnormalized time s := t/t0 . As expected from (30), we observe that \u03c6(s)\napproaches the value \u03c6 = 1 for s \u2192 \u221e. Moreover, the growth of the\nrecrystallized volume is nearly linear up to the value \u03c6(s) \u2248 1/4.

Conclusions and outlook\nLet us summarize our findings: We fix some time instant t0 \u001d 1 in the\nlate stage of Ostwald ripening, where we assume that the LSW theory is\nvalid.
