Interlayer and intralayer correlations are of comparable importance in this Landau level filling factor\n\u03bdT = \u03bd1 + \u03bd2 = nT /(eB/h) = 1 phase. The system exhibits a number of striking physical properties,\nincluding Josephson-like interlayer tunneling2 and vanishing Hall and longitudinal resistances3,4,5 when equal\nelectrical currents are driven in opposition (counterflow)\nin the two layers. The electronic correlations responsible for these properties may be understood in a number\nof equivalent languages, including that of itinerant ferromagnetism and that of excitonic Bose condensation6 .\nIndeed, the remarkable transport properties observed in\ncounterflow are very suggestive of excitonic superfluidity,\nalthough experiments have so far always detected small\namounts of residual dissipation.\nInterlayer tunneling provides particularly dramatic evidence that bilayer 2DESs at \u03bdT = 1 are quite different\nat large and small interlayer separations. When the effective layer separation (defined as the ratio d/l of the\ncenter-to-center quantum well spacing d to the magnetic\nlength l = (h\u0304/eB)1/2 ) is large, the interlayer tunneling\nconductance dI/dV is strongly suppressed around zero\ninterlayer voltage7. This suppression reflects the strongly\ncorrelated nature of single layer 2DESs at high magnetic\nfield. In essence, an electron which is rapidly injected into\na 2DES at \u03bd < 1 is completely uncorrelated with the existing N -particle system and thus creates a highly excited\nN +1-particle state which can only slowly relax to equilibrium. Similar considerations attend the rapid extraction\nof an electron from a 2DES at high magnetic field. Since\ninterlayer correlations are negligible at large d/l, the net\ntunneling conductance spectrum of the bilayer is a simple\nconvolution of the suppression effects in the individual\nlayers. In contrast, at sufficiently small d/l the inter-\n\nlayer tunneling conductance dI/dV at \u03bdT = 1 displays a\nstrong and extremely sharp peak centered at V = 0. The\nsharp peak in dI/dV reflects a near-discontinuity in the\ntunneling I \u2212 V curves at V = 0. This is reminiscent of\nthe dc Josephson effect, but it remains unclear how close\nthe analogy is.\nThe tunneling features observed at \u03bdT = 1 and small\nd/l are widely believed to reflect the development of\nspontaneous interlayer quantum phase coherence among\nthe electrons in the bilayer8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 . Electrons\nare just as strongly correlated with their neighbors in\ntheir own layer as they are with electrons in the opposite layer. Within the exciton condensate language, every\nelectron in the bilayer is bound to a correlation hole in\nthe opposite layer and there is no energy cost associated\nwith transferring an electron from one layer to the other.\nCrudely speaking, the Coulombic energy penalties associated with injection and extraction of electrons in the\ntunneling process are cancelled by the excitonic attraction of the electron to the hole in the final state.\nThe purpose of the present paper is to report on an\ninvestigation of how interlayer tunneling in the coherent\n\u03bdT = 1 phase is distributed across the sample area. Via\nelectrostatic gating we are able to study regions of different size and shape in the same sample. For effective layer\nseparations d/l not too much smaller than the critical\nvalue, approximately (d/l)c \u2248 1.91 as T \u2192 0 in our samples, we find that the zero bias tunneling conductance,\nG(0) \u2261 dI/dV at V = 0, is essentially proportional to\nthe sample area. This suggests that tunneling at \u03bdT = 1\nis a bulk phenomenon in our samples, at least close to the\ncritical layer separation. In spite of the intuitive nature of\nthis result, it is not obvious a priori. Indeed, the strong\nsimilarity between bilayer 2DESs at \u03bdT = 1 and Josephson junctions suggests that tunneling currents may be\nrestricted to micron-scale regions close to the source and\ndrain contacts and not exist in the bulk of the sample9 .\nWe discuss this and other theories of interlayer tunneling following the description of our experiment and its\nresults.\nThe bilayer 2DES samples used in this experiment are\n\n\f2\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n0.3\n\n(c)\n\nthgieH kaeP\n\n0.3\n\n)S\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\nm(\n\nm(\n\n)0(G\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n)S\n\nGaAs/AlGaAs double quantum wells grown by molecular\nbeam epitaxy (MBE). Two 18 nm GaAs quantum wells\nare separated by a 10 nm Al0.9 Ga0.1 As barrier. Modulation doping with Si populates the ground subband of each\nwell with a 2DES of nominal density n1,2 \u2248 5.5 \u00d7 1010\ncm\u22122 and low temperature mobility \u03bc \u2248 106 cm\u22122 /V s.\nThe tunnel splitting \u2206SAS between the lowest symmetric\nand antisymmetric states in the double well potential is\nestimated2,19 to be less than 100 \u03bcK; this is roughly six\norders of magnitude smaller than the mean Coulomb energy e2 /\u01ebl at \u03bdT = 1. Independent electrical contact to\nthe individual layers is achieved via a selective depletion\nmethod20 , thus allowing the measurement of interlayer\ntunneling via standard lock-in techniques.\nIn order to minimize systematic errors in the tunneling conductances due to sample-to-sample variations, we\nemploy a technique which allows multiple, independently\ncontrollable tunneling regions to be established on a single sample. Two such samples, A and B, (both taken\nfrom the same parent MBE wafer) have been studied.\nIn both cases a large electrostatic gate is deposited on\nthe back side of the sample. This gate allows for global\ncontrol of the electron density in the lower 2D electron\ngas in the active region of the sample. Smaller gates, of\nvarying sizes, are deposited on the sample's top surface.\nThese gates allow for local control of the top 2DES density. By adjusting the gates appropriately it is possible\nto establish a density balanced \u03bdT = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1 state\nunderneath any one of the top gates while the remainder\nof the sample is in an unbalanced \u03bdT 6= 1 configuration.\nSince tunneling is strongly enhanced at \u03bdT = 1 for d/l <\n(d/l)c , but strongly suppressed7 where \u03bdT 6= 1, it is not\ndifficult to separate out the conductance of the \u03bdT = 1\nregion. In fact, as we show below, this separation can\nalso be done at zero magnetic field. In sample A, the\nactive region of the device is a 200 \u03bcm wide bar, fully\nunderlaid by the large back gate. This bar is crossed by\nfour rectangular top gates, with lengths 100, 50, 20, and\n10 \u03bcm. The top gates thus define four different regions\nwith four different areas that are proportional to the top\ngate length. In sample B the mesa bar has an inner section of width 100 \u03bcm and two outer sections of width 200\n\u03bcm. A 100 \u03bcm top gate crosses the inner section while\ntwo 50 \u03bcm top gates cross the outer sections. This sample allows the comparison of regions with the same area\nbut different mesa widths and gate lengths. Schematic\ndiagrams of samples A and B are shown in Figs. 1a and\n3a, respectively.\nAt zero magnetic field momentum and energy conserving tunneling between parallel 2DESs can only occur when the subband energy levels in the two quantum\nwells line up21 . If the two 2DESs have equal electron\ndensities this occurs at zero interlayer voltage, V = 0.\nThe width of the tunnel resonance is set by the lifetime\nof the electrons in the 2DESs; at low temperatures this\nis dominated by impurity scattering22 . When the bilayer\nsystem is density imbalanced the tunnel resonance moves\nto a finite interlayer voltage proportional to the density\n\n0\n\n0.0\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0 0\n\nTop Gate Bias (V)\n\n50\nGate Length (\n\n100\n\nmm)\n\nFIG. 1: (color online) (a) Schematic diagram of sample A.\nWhite rectangle represents 200 \u03bcm-wide mesa containing the\nbilayer 2DES; ohmic contacts (not shown) to the individual\n2DES layers are attached near both ends of the mesa.

The line fitted to this data has an\nx-intercept of 3 \u00b1 2 \u03bcm.\n\ndifference. We exploit this fact to allow for clean separation of the tunneling conductance under the top gates\non our samples from the \"background\" tunneling coming\nfrom other portions of the device. Figure 1b illustrates\nthis with data from sample A. For the data shown, the\nback gate bias has been set to -15.18 V; this lowers the\ndensity in the bottom 2DES and thereby imbalances the\nbilayer. With the top gates set to zero bias a measurement of the net tunneling conductance at zero interlayer\nvoltage, i.e. G(0), yields a relatively small background\nvalue; the main resonance having been displaced to a finite interlayer voltage by the imbalance. However, if the\nbias voltage on one of the top gates is swept, a resonance\nappears when the density of the top 2DES under that\ngate matches the density of the lower 2DES. This is what\nFig. 1b displays, there being one curve for each of the\nfour top gates. Each gate produces a clear resonance in\nG(0) when biased to about -0.17 V23 . These resonances\nsit atop a background conductance of about 50 nS which\narises from off-resonant tunneling from those regions of\nthe device not under the swept top gate.\nFigure 1c shows the background-subtracted peak tunneling conductance for each of the four top gate traces\n\n\f3\n(b)\n\n2\n\n1.0\n\n60 mK\n\n0.0\n\nm(\n\n1\n85 mK\n\n)S\n\nVd/Id\n\n0.5\n\nthgieH kaeP\n\n(a)\n\nm(\n\nAt \u03bdT = 1 the situation is both simpler and more\ncomplex than at B = 0. The strong suppression7 of\ntunneling in the unbalanced regions of the sample where\n\u03bdT 6= 1 and the strong enhancement at small d/l of the\ntunneling in the balanced \u03bdT = 1 regions under the top\ngates are both helpful in keeping the background tunneling conductance (typically \u223c1 nS) a small fraction of\nthe peak conductance at \u03bdT = 1 (typically \u223c10 - 1500\nnS). In contrast, it is much more difficult to ensure that\nthe bilayer is density balanced at \u03bdT = 1 than it is at\nzero magnetic field. At \u03bdT = 1 the tunnel resonance remains centered at zero interlayer voltage, regardless of\nthe individual layer densities, provided \u03bd1 + \u03bd2 = \u03bdT = 1.\nFurthermore, the robustness of the \u03bdT = 1 state against\nsmall antisymmetric shifts in the individual filling factors\n(\u03bd1 \u2192 \u03bd1 + \u03b4\u03bd, \u03bd2 \u2192 \u03bd2 \u2212 \u03b4\u03bd) complicates the determination that a balanced \u03bdT = 1 system is present. In\norder to establish the gate voltages required for balanced\n\u03bdT = 1 state underneath any given top gate, we first use\nan empirical calibration of the gates24 to choose approximate top and back gate voltages (Vtop and Vback ) which\nwill create \u03bd1 \u2248 \u03bd2 \u2248 1/2 in each layer at some chosen\nmagnetic field. Since the empirical calibrations are reasonably good, this results in a clear tunneling peak at\nV = 0, thus proving that the system is at least close\nto the desired balanced \u03bdT = 1 configuration. Next,\nthe zero bias tunneling conductance G(0) is recorded as\nboth the Vtop and Vback are scanned across a window in\nvoltage space. Examination of the resulting data clearly\nreveals contours of constant total filling factor. Small\nrefinements of the magnetic field and the gate voltages\nare then made to first maximize G(0) vs. B and then\n\n1.5\n\n)S\n\nshown in Fig. 1b. The background subtraction is necessarily slightly different for each top gate. The tunneling conductance observed with all top gates grounded\ngives the amount of tunneling that comes from the entire tunneling region when imbalanced. When a bias is\napplied to one of the top gates to create a balanced region underneath, the net area of the device which remains imbalanced is reduced by the area of the biased\ntop gate. We use this fact to calculate the correct background for each top gate. The corrected peak heights\nvs. top gate length are plotted in Fig. 1c. The data are\nwell-fitted by a straight line with a small x-intercept of\napproximately 3 \u00b1 2 \u03bcm. For the data shown in Fig. 1,\nn1 = n2 = 3.3 \u00d7 1010 cm\u22122 at the resonance; but this\nsame linear dependence on gate length is observed at all\nmatched densities ranging from 2.9 to 3.4 \u00d7 1010 cm\u22122 .\nWe therefore conclude that tunneling is proportional to\narea at B = 0, as expected. The positive x-intercept\nin the peak height versus top gate length relation may\nindicate that boundary effects are reducing the effective\ntunneling area. For example, fringe fields along the edge\nof the gated regions could produce a density gradient\nover length scales comparable to the distance between\nthe upper 2DES and the top gate (0.5 \u03bcm), thus reducing the area in the upper 2DES that has electron density\nmatching that of the lower layer.\n\n125 mK\n\n0\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\nInterlayer Voltage (\n\n0\n\nmV)\n\n50\nGate Length (\n\n100\n\nmm)\n\nFIG. 2: (color online) Tunneling vs. gate length at \u03bdT = 1 in\nsample A at d/l = 1.81.

The four traces (tallest to\nshortest) correspond to tunneling under the four different top gates, with lengths 100, 50, 20, and 10 \u03bcm. As\nexplained above, there is negligible background tunneling coming from other parts of the sample. Figure 2b\nshows the height of the tunneling peak at zero interlayer\nvoltage, i.e. G(0), vs. top gate length at three temperatures, 60, 85, and 125 mK, for this same effective layer\nspacing. The data reveal a clear linear dependence on\ngate length. A small x-intercept, 5 \u00b1 2 \u03bcm is obtained\nfrom the linear least squares fits. Data very similar to\nthat shown in Fig. 2 has been obtained at effective layer\nspacings ranging from d/l = 1.70 to 1.88 and at temperatures from T = 60 mK to 300 mK. In all cases the height\nof the tunneling peak scales linearly with gate length.\nAt smaller d/l deviations from the linear dependence\non gate length begin to appear. However, these deviations are most likely artifacts arising from the reduced\nsheet conductivity of the 2D systems at these lower densities and the concomitant enhanced tunneling conductance. When the sheet conductivity of the 2DESs no\nlonger greatly exceeds the tunneling conductance, voltage drops develop within the 2D layers. The resonance\nin dI/dV becomes broadened and suppressed in height.\nSince this effect is more pronounced in larger tunneling\nareas than in smaller ones, the tunneling peak height\nbecomes sub-linear in gate length. For this reason we\nrestrict our attention here to effective layer spacings and\ntemperatures relatively close to the phase boundary26\n\n\f4\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n60\n\n(c)\n\n3\n\nVd/Id\n)S\n\n)0(G\n\nm(\n\n)Sn(\n\n2\n40\n\n1\n20\n\n0\n0\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\nTop Gate Bias (V)\n\n-100\n\n0\n\nInterlayer Voltage (\n\n100\n\nmV)\n\nFIG. 3: (color online) (a) Schematic diagram of the mesa and\ngates in the active region of sample B.

(c) Tunneling\nconductance resonances (dI/dV vs. V ) at \u03bdT = 1 with d/l =\n1.64 and T = 61 mK. In (b) and (c) the solid trace (black)\ncorresponds to the 100 \u03bcm square tunneling region and dotted trace (red) to the 200 \u00d7 50 \u03bcm rectangular region. The\nred trace in (c) has been multiplied by 1.086, as described in\nthe text.\n\nseparating the interlayer coherent and incoherent states\nat \u03bdT = 1. In this regime we are confident that sheet\nresistance effects are negligible.\nThe data in Fig. 2 strongly suggest that the interlayer\ntunneling conductance in the coherent \u03bdT = 1 state is\nproportional to the area of the tunneling region. However, since in sample A it is the length of the gated regions\nthat is varied while the width (200 \u03bcm) is constant, it remains possible that the tunneling conductance is simply\nproportional to gate length, not area. For this reason we\nnow turn to the results obtained from sample B. This device, illustrated schematically in Fig. 3a, contains three\ntop-gated regions; two are 200 \u03bcm wide by 50 \u03bcm long\nrectangles and the third is a 100\u00d7100 \u03bcm square. These\nthree regions all have the same area but differ by a factor\nof two in gate length and width. Since the two rectangular gates are identical in size and shape, we focus here\non the comparison of the inner square top gate and one\nof these outer rectangular gates. Direct comparisons of\ntunneling in the two rectangles justify this simplification.\nFigure 3b shows typical tunneling conductance resonances in sample B at zero magnetic field. As with sample A, at B = 0 it is most informative to plot G(0), the\ntunneling conductance at zero interlayer voltage, versus\ntop gate bias at fixed back gate bias, here Vback = \u221217.08\nV. Although sample B was taken from the same MBE\n\nwafer as sample A, its tunneling conductance per unit\narea is about a factor of \u223c 2 smaller. We attribute this\ndifference to known wafer-scale variations in the thicknesses of the various epilayers in the sample27 . More\nsignificantly, Fig. 3b shows that the peak tunneling conductance of the 100 \u03bcm square region is about 10 percent larger, and the resonance width about 10 percent\nsmaller, than that in the 200 \u00d7 50 \u03bcm rectangle. While\nthese differences might be due to differing degrees of density inhomogeneity in the two regions, their exact origin\nis unknown. In the following, when comparing the tunneling conductances at \u03bdT = 1 in the square and rectangular regions of sample B, we correct for this small effect\nby multiplying the tunneling data from the rectangular\nregion by the appropriate factor deduced from the zero\nfield data. Figure 3c illustrates the results of this comparison of tunneling conductance spectra (dI/dV vs. V )\nat \u03bdT = 1 for d/l = 1.64 and T = 60 mK; there is essentially no difference in the spectra from these two differently shaped regions. Very similar results have been\nfound at densities corresponding to 1.60 \u2264 d/l \u2264 1.79\nand temperatures from T = 60 to 300 mK.\nTaken together, the data presented in Figs. 2 and 3\nprovide strong evidence that the enhanced tunneling conductance characteristic of the coherent \u03bdT = 1 bilayer\nstate is proportional to the area of the tunneling region,\nat least over a limited range of d/l and temperature near\nthe phase boundary. The possibility that the conductance is instead proportional to the perimeter of the tunneling region, or simply the length of that region along\nthe mesa boundary is not consistent with the present\nfindings.\nThe intuitive character of our findings belies the subtle\nnature of tunneling in the coherent bilayer \u03bdT = 1 state.\nThe long-wavelength effective Hamiltonian for this manyelectron state is closely analogous to that of a Josephson\njunction. As pointed out by Stern, et al.9 this analogy leads to a sine-Gordon equation for the collective\nphase variable \u03c6 representing the orientation of the pseudospin magnetization in the ferromagnetically ordered\nstate17,18 . In an ideal, disorder-free sample this equation leads to the conclusion that interlayer tunnel currents (proportional to sin\u03c6) are restricted to narrow regions near where the current enters and leaves the bilayer\nsystem28 . The width \u03bbJ of these regions is determined by\nthe pseudospin stiffness and the tunnel splitting \u2206SAS ,\nand is estimated to be in the few \u03bcm range. In contrast to\nthe results presented here, this scenario would not result\nin a tunneling conductance proportional to area29 .\nMore realistic models of the distribution of tunneling in\nthe coherent \u03bdT = 1 state have recently been advanced by\nFertig and Murthy30 and by Rossi, et al.31 . Both models\nattempt to incorporate the crucial effects of disorder on\nthe tunneling. In Fertig and Murthy's picture30 fluctuations in the 2DES density lead to a complex network of\nchannels and nodes, covering the entire sample, in which\nthe coherent \u03bdT = 1 state exists. Tunneling occurs at\nthe nodes of the network. Since the disorder length scale\n\n\f5\nis expected to be small (< 1 \u03bcm, set by the separation\nbetween the dopant layers and the 2DESs), the number\nof nodes, and therefore the net tunneling conductance,\nis predicted to be proportional to sample area in large\ndevices, in agreement with our results. In the model of\nRossi, et al.31 disorder along the physical edge of the\nsample is expected to dominate when the coherent phase\nis well-developed (i.e. at small d/l and very low temperature). In this regime they predict that the tunneling\nconductance will be proportional to the length along the\nsample edge, not the total area. Although this is in conflict with our observations, we stress that our results are\nconfined to relatively large d/l, in fairly close proximity\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n5\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n14\n\n15\n16\n\n17\n18\n19\n20\n\n21\n\nFor an early review, see the chapters by S.M.

We therefore conclude that tunneling in the\ncoherent \u03bdT = 1 state, much like tunneling at zero magnetic field, is a bulk phenomenon in our samples.\nWe are pleased to thank Herb Fertig and Allan MacDonald for enlightening discussions.
