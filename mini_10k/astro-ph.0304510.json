The source was detected as a SSS in\n1992 and disappeared in subsequent X-ray observations. The source was active again during recent XMM-Newton\nobservations. It appeared to be very soft (kT \u223c 60 eV) and very luminous (\u223c 1038 \u2212 1039 erg s\u22121 ). The two XMMNewton observations also reveal that the source went from a \"high\" state to a \"low\" state in 6 days. We also\nfound a 5.4-hr periodicity during the \"low\" state. We consider white dwarf, black hole, and neutron star models\nto explain the nature of the source.\nSubject headings: galaxies: individual (NGC 300) - X-rays: binaries - X-rays: galaxy\nThe XMM-Newton instrument modes were full-frame,\nmedium filter for the three European Photon Imaging Cameras\n(EPIC). The first observation was taken on 2000 December 26\nfor 37 ks and the second observation was on 2001 January 1\nfor about 47 ks. After rejecting intervals with a high background level, we considered a good time interval of \u223c 28 ks\nand \u223c 40 ks for the first and second observation, respectively.\nData were reduced and analyzed with the XMM-Newton SAS\npackage v5.3.3.\nWe used here the MOS images to determine the position\nof the source because the spatial resolution of MOS detector is slightly better than that of pn. The source is located at\nR.A.=00h55m10s.7, Dec.=\u221237\u25e638\u2032 55\u2032\u2032 (J2000), \u223c 4\u2032 (2.4 kpc)\nfrom the galactic center; the derived positions from the two\nXMM-Newton observations agree with each other. This position\nis about 5\u2032\u2032 off from previous ROSAT PSPC observation, and is\nconsistent with the positional error (7.3\u2032\u2032 ) quoted by Read &\nPietsch (2001).\nSource spectra and lightcurves of XMMU J005510.7-373855\nwere extracted with the SAS task XMMSELECT. Source-free regions were used for background to avoid the chip boundary and\na nearby faint source. In order to allow \u03c72 statistics to be used,\nall the spectra were binned such that there are at least 20 counts\nper spectral bin. Response matrices were created by RMFGEN\nand ARFGEN.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nSupersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) form a distinct class of objects, first established through ROSAT observations. The hallmarks of SSSs are very soft X-ray emission (kT typically < 100\neV) and bolometric luminosities of 1036 \u2212 1038 erg s\u22121 . The advent of Chandra and XMM-Newton provides good opportunities to detect and study SSSs in nearby galaxies. Luminous\n(1038\u221240 erg s\u22121 ) SSSs have been found in several nearby galaxies including M31 (Kong et al. 2002; Di Stefano et al. 2002a),\nM81 (Swartz et al. 2002), M101 (Pence et al. 2001; Mukai et al.\n2003; Di Stefano & Kong 2003 [DK03]), NGC4697 (Sarazin,\nIrwin & Bregman 2001; DK03), M51 (DK03), and M83 (Soria\n& Wu 2003; DK03).\nNGC 300 is an SA(s)d galaxy, seen near face-on (inclination\nangle 46\u25e6 ; Tully 1988) at a distance of 2.0 \u00b1 0.1 Mpc (Freedman et al. 2001). The galaxy has been observed by ROSAT\n(Read et al. 1997; Read & Pietsch 2001) and XMM-Newton\n(Soria & Kong 2003).\nIn this Letter, we report the reappearance of a luminous SSS\nin NGC 300 as observed with XMM-Newton.\n2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\n\n2.1. ROSAT\nNGC 300 was observed by ROSAT five times from 1991 to\n1997. A detailed analysis of the ROSAT data was done by Read\n& Pietsch (2001). Briefly, the datasets consist of 2 Position\nSensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC) and 3 High Resolution\nImager (HRI) pointings. The exposures range from \u223c 9 ks to\n\u223c 37 ks. The luminous supersoft source was only detected in a\n37 ks PSPC observation taken on 1992 May and June (see Read\n& Pietsch 2001). Spectral analysis was also done by Read et al.\n(1997). We have reanalyzed the PSPC spectrum taken on 1992\nMay/June, and used other data to set upper limits on the luminosity for the long-term lightcurve.\nWe extracted the source spectrum from a 30\u2032\u2032 circular region,\nwhile background was from an annulus region (45\u2032\u2032 and 60\u2032\u2032\nradii) centered on the source. The spectrum was grouped into\nat least 20 counts per spectral bin to allow \u03c72 statistics to be\nused.\n\n3. ANALYSES AND RESULTS\n\nSpectral analysis was performed by making use of XSPEC\nv11.2. Table 1 shows the best-fitting spectral parameters for the\nthree ROSAT and XMM-Newton observations.\nFor the ROSAT observation, the spectrum (see Figure 1)\ncan be fit with a blackbody model with NH = 1.1 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122\nand kT = 48.7 eV; the 0.2\u20132 keV luminosity is 1039 erg s\u22121 .\nWe note that Read et al. (1997) fit the spectrum with a\nthermal bremsstrahlung model with temperature of a 0.1 keV\nand we confirmed that it is also an acceptable model. Using the thermal bremsstrahlung model, the luminosity becomes\n3.8 \u00d7 1038 erg s\u22121 [the luminosity quoted by Read et al. (1997)\nis 1.6 \u00d7 1037 erg s\u22121 , which is an absorbed luminosity corrected\nfor absorption in our own Galaxy], a factor of 2.5 lower than\nthe blackbody model. While we cannot distinguish between\n\n2.2. XMM-Newton\n1\n2\n\nHarvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, MA 02138; akong@cfa.harvard.edu\nDepartment of Physics and Astronomy, Tufts University, Medford, MA 02155\n\n1\n\n\f2\nthe two models statistically, we prefer the blackbody model\nas subsequent XMM-Newton observations confirm the supersoft nature of the source (see below). Also, the XMM-Newton\nobservations would have detected the high energy photons associated with the thermal bremsstrahlung model, had the model\nbeen correct. Finally, the XMM-Newton observations provide\nmore photons than ROSAT.\nWe fit the pn, MOS1 and MOS2 data simultaneously with\nseveral single-component models with interstellar absorption\n(including absorbed power-law, thermal bremsstrahlung, blackbody and Raymond-Smith); only the blackbody model provides\nan acceptable fit. The blackbody temperature of both observations ranges between 57 eV and 67 eV, while the NH varies from\n1.5 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 in the first observation to 5.3 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 in the\nsecond observation. The 0.2\u20132 keV luminosity also drops from\n9 \u00d7 1038 erg s\u22121 to 1.2 \u00d7 1038 erg s\u22121 , indicating that the source\nis a variable on timescale of days. The spectra of the two observations are shown in Figure 1.\nThe combined ROSAT and XMM-Newton long-term\nlightcurve of the SSS is shown in Figure 2, which is constructed from a series of ROSAT and XMM-Newton pointings.\nThe source was below the detection limit of other ROSAT observations. In these cases, we estimated the 3\u03c3 limits, assuming\na blackbody model with mean NH (1021 cm\u22122 ) and kT (58 eV).\nThe value of NH plays an important role in estimating the luminosity. For instance, if we lower the NH to 5.3 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 ,\nas found in the second XMM-Newton observation, the upper\nlimits decrease by a factor of \u223c 3. In other words, the source\nvaries by as much as factor of 30 between the \"low\" state and\nthe \"high\" state spanning 8.5 years.\nTo search for short-term variability, we computed the LombScargle periodogram (LSP; Lomb 1976; Scargle 1982), a modification of the discrete Fourier transform which is generalized\nto the case of uneven spacing. In each observation, we extracted\nthe combined background subtracted lightcurve from pn and\nMOSs to increase the signal-to-noise. Individual lightcurves\nfrom each of the three detectors were also used to verify the\nresult. By applying the LSP to the combined lightcurve, we\nfound that there is a sharp peak at 5.4 hr in the \"low\" state observation (see Figure 3). Independent checks from the pn and\nMOS data also confirmed the periodicity. We determined the\n99.9% confidence level by generating Gausiaan noise datasets\nwith the same time intervals and variance as the true data, and\nthen performed the LSP analysis on the resulting datasets (see\nKong, Charles & Kuulkers 1998). The peak power in each\nperiodogram (which must be purely due to noise) was then\nrecorded. This was repeated 10000 times to obtain good statistics. The peak at 5.4 hr is well above the 99.9% confidence\nlevel. The folded lightcurve of the \"low\" state data in 5.4 hr is\nalso shown in Figure 3.\nSimilar analysis was also carried out in the \"high\" state data,\nbut there is no significant peak in the LSP. The folded lightcurve\nshows no obvious periodic variability at 5.4 hr (see Figure 3).\nIt is not clear if it is due to geometric effect but the exposure\ntime of the \"high\" state covers less than 8 hr, corresponding to\n1.4 cycles of the 5.4-hr period in contrast to the 2.1 cycles in\nthe \"low\" state. We therefore performed Kolmogorov-Smirnov\ntest to test for variability and found significant variability at the\n99.9% levels. We also search for variability of the hardness\nratio but no significant change was found in both observations.\nWe also examined an Digitized Sky Survey image of NGC\n3\n\nsee http://www.aip.de/\u223cjcg/sss/ssscat.html for updated catalog\n\n300 to search for possible optical counterpart. Within a 4\u2032\u2032 error circle of the XMM-Newton position, there is no obvious optical counterpart with limiting B and R magnitudes of 21 and\n18.1, respectively. However, the source is surrounded by HII\nregions (Deharveng et al. 1988; Blair & Long 1997), OB associations (Pietrzynski et al. 2001) and supernova remnants (Blair\n& Long 1997). The nearest HII region (source 136; Deharveng\net al. 1988) is located about 20\u2032\u2032 (\u223c 200 pc) south-east of the\nX-ray source. Within 50\u2032\u2032 (\u223c 500 pc) of the SSS, we found\nan OB association (AS99; Pietrzynski et al. 2001), two supernova remnant candidates (N300-S21, N300-N23; Blair & Long\n1997) and a HII region (N300-H20; Blair & Long 1997). We\nalso looked for UV counterpart from the Optical Monitor (OM)\nimage (see Soria & Kong 2003 for details of the OM observations); no counterpart is found at the position of the SSS in both\nobservations.\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nIt is clear from the spectral fits of all ROSAT and XMMNewton observations that the XMMU J005510.7-373855 is\nvery soft (kT \u223c 48 \u2212 67 eV) and is highly variable. Such a soft\nspectrum is consistent with SSSs seen in our own Galaxy, the\nMagellanic Clouds, M31 (Greiner 2000 3 ) and several nearby\ngalaxies (see \u00a7 1). Since the Galactic and Magellanic Cloud\nSSSs are conjectured to be white dwarfs (WDs), it is reasonable to consider a WD model for the source in NGC 300. Since,\nhowever, the luminosity in the high state may be too large to be\nconsistent with the standard SSS WD model, we also consider\nblack hole (BH) and neutron star (NS) models.\nThe X-ray emission of the SSS could come from a WD that\nburns accreting hydrogen in a quasi-steady manner. The maximum luminosity is the Eddington luminosity for a 1.4M\u2299 object. WD models therefore seem to be ruled out by the high\nbolometric luminosities during 2 of the observations. It is nevertheless worth noting that the WD model temperatures are\ncomparable to those we observed, and that X-ray variability\nby a factor of a few over times of days and months has been\nobserved in SSSs. (see e.g., Greiner and Di Stefano 2002 and\nreferences therein.) If the 5.4-hour variation detected during the\nX-ray low state corresponds to an orbital period, then this system may be similar to 1E0035.4-7230, a Magellanic Cloud SSS\nthat appears to have a 4 hour period (Kahabka 1996). In such\na short-period binary, it is likely that a radiation-driven wind\nplays an important role in the binary evolution. (see, e.g., van\nTeeseling & King 1998) A WD model would perhaps be the\nmost natural explanation for the SSS in NGC 300, were it not\nfor the high estimated bolometric luminosities. Note that it may\nbe difficult to use beaming to circumvent the Eddington limit in\nthese systems, since the inner region of the accretion disk can\nalso become a luminous emitter of SSS radiation (Popham &\nDi Stefano 1996).\nSSS emission is expected from accreting BHs. Modeling\nthe accretion disk as a thin disk which is optically thick, we\ncan derive a relationship between the minimum mass of the\naccretor, and the observed temperature and luminosity (Frank,\nKing, & Raine 2002). Using kT = 60 eV and LX = 1038 erg s\u22121\n(1039 erg s\u22121 ), we find that the accretor mass is greater than\n\u2248 890M\u2299 (2800M\u2299). Although the fact that the observed luminosity is 102 \u2212 103 times smaller than the Eddington luminosity may call the validity of the disk model into question, this\ncalculation suggests that the accretor is an intermediate-mass\n\n\f3\nBH. If the accretor is a BH, we may use Lobs = 0.1\u1e41c2 (\u03b7/0.1),\nwhere \u1e41 is the accretion rate and \u03b7, the efficiency factor, is\nlikely to be close to 0.1. This yields \u1e41 \u2248 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22128 M\u2299 /yr\n(1.8 \u00d7 10\u22127 M\u2299 /yr) for Lobs = 1038 erg s\u22121 (Lobs = 1039 erg s\u22121 ).\nThis would be consistent with an irradiation-driven wind from a\nlow-mass donor. Measurement of the orbital period could provide supporting evidence. Indeed, if the donor fills its Roche\nlobe, then Porb \u2248 (8.9 hrs)(Md /M\u2299 ), where Md is the mass of\nthe donor star. If Porb = 5.4 hrs, then Md \u2248 0.61M\u2299.\nIt is of course possible that the observed emission emanates\nfrom an accreting NS. In this case the SSS emission would presumably emanate from a photosphere which is much larger than\nthe neutron star itself. The photospheric radius would be different in each observation: 3.7 \u00d7 109 cm during the ROSAT observation, 2.6 \u00d7 109 cm during the XMM-Newton high-state observation, and 6.8 \u00d7 108 cm during the XMM-Newton low-state\nobservation, corresponding to the different temperatures and luminosities.\nAt this point, neutron star models seem conceptually\nunattractive because there is no obvious explanation for why\nthe photosphere should achieve these relatively large sizes, and\nno way to relate them to the system's fundamental physical parameters. In addition, just as in the WD models, the luminosity appears to be super-Eddington during two of the observations, unless the neutron star has a mass as large as 3 \u2212 4 M\u2299 .\nIn this case, if the efficiency of turning accretion energy into\nX-rays is the same during all 3 observations, then the accretion\n\nrate must have changed by an order of magnitude, approaching\n2 \u00d7 10\u22128 M\u2299 yr\u22121 during the high state. (see Di Stefano et al.\n2002b for a similar model of the X-ray source in the globular\ncluster Bo 375.) If, on the other hand, the mass of the neutron\nstar is close to 1.4 M\u2299 , then other ways around the Eddington\nlimit must be found; e.g., the energy could be beamed into a\nsmaller solid angle during the 2 high-state observations. In this\ncase, the accretion rate could be significantly lower.\n5. SUMMARY\n\nWe have studied a recurrent luminous SSS in NGC300 with\nXMM-Newton. The source was seen by ROSAT in 1992 and\nfell below the detection limit in subsequent ROSAT observations. It reappeared in recent XMM-Newton observations with\nbolometric luminosities between 1038 and 1039 erg s\u22121 . During\nthe \"low\" state, the source showed a 5.4-hr periodicity. If we\nconsider the periodicity is due to the orbital period, then the\nX-ray emission can be explained by WD, BH, and NS models.\nHowever, WD and NS models appear to be unlikely due to the\nhigh X-ray luminosity during the \"high\" state. Further repeated\nX-ray observations of the SSS in different states may permit\ndiscrimination among these models.\nThis work was supported by NASA under an LTSA grant,\nNAG5-10705.
