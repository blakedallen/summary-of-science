Although the cosmological constant is usually\nassumed as the dark energy, in the past years, a slowly evolving scalar field, dubbed as \"quintessence\"\nhas been proposed as the dark energy [3] and has been been studied by many authors [4]. There are\nsome differences between the cosmological constant and quintessence. Firstly, for the quintessence, the\nequation-of-state parameter \u03c9Q = \u03c1Q /pQ varies with time, whilst for the cosmological constant, it remains\na fixed value \u03c9\u039b = \u22121. Secondly, since the quintessence is a scalar field, it fluctuates.\nOne of the observational effects produced by the existence of the quintessence is the CMB anisotropies.\nIn many cases, the quintessence dominates the universe at late times (z \u223c O(1), with z being redshift)\nafter the recombination. At that epoch the gravitational potential is changed because the equation of\nstate for quintessence is different from that for non-relativistic matter, which leads to an enhancement of\nthe CMB anisotropies at large angular scales l . 10 due to the late-time integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect.\nThe quintessence also changes the locations of the acoustic peaks in the CMB angular power spectrum\nbecause the projection of the horizon at last scattering onto the present sky is enlarged compared with\nmodels with the cosmological constant. Furthermore, the initial fluctuations of the quintessence fields are\ngenerated during inflation. These fluctuations behave as isocurvature mode [5] and hence the quintessence\nmay have both adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations.\n\n2\n\nCMB anisotropy in models with cosine-type quintessence\n\nThe quintessence model we take here is the cosine-type quintessence which has the potential\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0013\nQ\nQ\n4\n4\n2\nV (Q) = \u039b 1 \u2212 cos\n= 2\u039b sin\n,\nfQ\n2fQ\n\n(1)\n\nwhere fQ and \u039b are model parameters. This type of potential can be generated if the quintessence field\nis a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson. In this class of models, effective mass of the quintessence field is\nalways of O(\u039b2 /fQ ).\n1 To appear in the proceedings of \"Frontier of Cosmology and Gravitation\" (YITP, Kyoto, April 25-27, 2001). This\npresentation is based on the work with M. Kawasaki and T. Moroi [1, 2].\n\n1\n\n\fSince the quintessence is a scalar field, its amplitude may have position-dependent fluctuations. To\ninvestigate its behavior, we decompose the Q field as Q(t, ~x) = Q\u0304(t) + q(t, ~x), where q is the perturbation\nof the amplitude of the quintessence field. Before we consider the fluctuations of the quintessence fields,\nwe discuss the dynamics of the zero mode of the quintessence fields briefly. For details, see Ref.[1].\n \u0308 + 3H Q\u0307 + dV /dQ = 0 where the dot represents\nThe zero mode Q\u0304 obeys the equation of motion Q\u0304\nthe derivative with respect to time t. When the relation H . \u039b2 /fQ is satisfied, the quintessence\nfield starts to oscillate. If the combination \u039b2 /fQ is large, the oscillation starts earlier epoch and the\nquintessence field undergoes many oscillations until the present time. We call the parameter space where\nthe oscillation of the quintessence is significant as \"oscillatory region.\" When the quintessence field starts\nto oscillate earlier, it dominates the energy density of the universe from earlier epoch. This has significant\nimplications to the CMB power spectrum.\nNow we discuss the the fluctuations of the quintessence fields. There are two origins of non-vanishing\nq at the present time; one is non-vanishing gravitational potential \u03a8 and the other is primordial q itself.\nWe call these modes as \"adiabatic\" and \"isocurvature\" modes, respectively. In the actual situations, both\nmodes may exist. Since these modes are uncorrelated, the total fluctuation can be decomposed into two\nmodes which originate to primordial fluctuations in \u03a8 and q, respectively:\n\u001a\n\u001a\n\u03a8(a \u2192 0) 6= 0\n\u03a8(a \u2192 0) = 0\nAdiabatic :\n,\nIsocurvature :\n.\n(2)\nq(a \u2192 0) = 0\nq(a \u2192 0) 6= 0\nWe assume that there is no entropy fluctuations between any of two energy components other than\nthat of quintessence. Thus, the adiabatic mode given with the initial condition (2) corresponds to the\nconventional adiabatic initial condition. On the contrary, the mode with the initial condition (2) is called\n\"isocurvature mode,\" since the total density fluctuation and the potential \u03a8 vanishes as a \u2192 0 if this is\nthe only source of the fluctuation in the early universe. To parameterize the relative size of adiabatic and\nisocurvature contributions, it is convenient to define rq , the ratio of the primordial value of q\u0303 to that of\nthe gauge-invariant variable \u03a8\u0303 at the radiation-dominated universe\nq\u0303\n,\n(3)\nrq \u2261\nM\u2217 \u03a8\u0303\nwhere M\u2217 is the reduced Planck scale. Since the ratio rq generically depends on the model of the inflation,\nwe treat rq as a free parameter in our analysis. (For example, for the chaotic inflation with Vinf \u221d \u03c7p\nwith p being an integer p = 2 \u2212 10, rq \u2243 0.3 \u2212 0.6. 2 )\n\n2.1\n\nAdiabatic Fluctuation\n\nHere, we discuss the CMB anisotropy in models with quintessence. To calculate the CMB angular power\nspectrum, we used the modified version of CMBFAST [9]. In this section, we consider the adiabatic\nmodes, so we take rq = 0.\nSome of interesting features in the CMB angular power spectrum are discussed in order. First, let\nus consider the locations of the acoustic peaks. The locations of the peaks depend on two quantities,\nthe sound horizon at last scattering and the angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface.\nApproximately, the location of n-th peak in the l space is estimated as ln \u2243 (r\u03b8 (\u03c4\u2217 )/rs (\u03c4\u2217 ))n\u03c0 [10], where\nr\u03b8 (\u03c4\u2217 ) is the angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface and rs (\u03c4\u2217 ) is the sound horizon\nat last scattering. Since the behavior of the cosine-type quintessence is almost the same as that of\nthe cosmological constant until very recently, rs (\u03c4\u2217 ) is the same in both cases. However, r\u03b8 (\u03c4\u2217 ) in the\nquintessence model is different from that in the \u039bCDM models. Since the quintessence models provides\nlarger total energy density of the universe than the \u039bCDM models in the earlier epoch, the angular\ndiameter distance in the quintessence model becomes smaller than that in the \u039bCDM models. As we can\nsee from Fig. 1, the location of the peaks is shifted to lower multipole l for the quintessence models. If\nwe take a parameter in the oscillatory region, this feature becomes more prominent.\nNext let us consider the height of the acoustic peaks. Since the energy density of the quintessence\nbecomes dominant when z \u223c O(1), the late time integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect enhances low\n2 In our analysis, we only consider the case with scale-independent primordial fluctuation, and r is treated as a scaleq\ninvariant quantity. When rq has a scale dependence via \u03a8\u0303 and/or q\u0303, rq (k) for the present horizon scale becomes the most\nimportant since the quadrupole anisotropy is most strongly affected by the isocurvature mode as will be shown below.\n\n2\n\n\f5\n\nGeV )\n\n5000\n\n\u221212\n\n4000\n\nC\nB\nA\n\n2\n\n3000\n\nE\nD\n\n\u039b (10\n\n2000\n1000\n\n\u03a9 Q < 0.7\n\n1\n\nl ( l + 1 ) C l/2\u03c0\n\n6000\n\n3\n\nCOBE\nMAXIMA-1\nBOOMERanG98\n\n7000\n\n4\n\n8000\n\n0\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n0.5\n\nl\n\nFigure 1: The CMB angular power spectrum in models\nwith cosine-type quintessence. The parameters we take\nhere, fQ = 1.8\u00d71018 GeV, \u039b = 2.4\u00d710\u221212 GeV (dashed\nline), \u039b = 3.0\u00d710\u221212 GeV (dotted line), \u039b = 4.0\u00d710\u221212\nGeV (dash-dot line), \u039b = 5.0 \u00d7 10\u221212 GeV (dash-dotdot line). For comparison, we also show the \u039bCDM case\n(solid line). The cosmological parameters are taken to\nbe h = 0.65, \u03a9\u039b,Q = 0.7, \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9b h2 = 0.019,\nand the initial spectral index is n = 1. We also show\nthe data points from COBE [6], BOOMERanG [7], and\nMAXIMA [8].\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n2.5\n\n18\n\nfQ ( 10 GeV )\nFigure 2: Constraints on the parameters \u039b and\nfQ .

Such an enhancement may be more effective in the quintessence models than in the \u039bCDM\nmodels since, in the quintessence case, the \"dark energy\" (i.e., the quintessence) may dominate the\nuniverse earlier than in the \u039bCDM case. As a result, the ratio of the height of the first peak to C10\nbecomes smaller. On the contrary, since the quintessence becomes the dominant component of the\nuniverse only at later epoch, pattern of the acoustic oscillation before the recombination does not change\ncompared to \u039bCDM models. Therefore, ratios of the height of the first peak to those of higher peaks are\nthe same as \u039bCDM models.\nNow we discuss constraints on the cosine-type quintessence models from the observations of COBE,\nBOOMERanG and MAXIMA. Constraints on the parameter fQ and \u039b are shown in Fig. 2. When we take\na parameter in the oscillatory regions, the quintessence field becomes dominant component of the universe\nat earlier epoch. Namely the late time ISW effect becomes large and the angular diameter distance to\nthe last scattering surface becomes smaller as mentioned before. Therefore, if \u039b is significantly large, the\nlate time ISW effect enhances angular power spectrum at low multipoles. As a result, the heights of the\nacoustic peaks are suppressed relative to Cl with small l.\n\n2.2\n\nIsocurvature Fluctuation\n\nNext, we consider the CMB anisotropy in the case with the isocurvature mode. We calculate the CMB\nanisotropy for various cases, and in Table 1, we show the quadrupole C2 normalized by C10 .\nIf we limit ourselves to the parameter region which is consistent with the COBE, BOOMERanG,\nand MAXIMA observations with simple scale-invariant primordial fluctuation, effect of the isocurvature\nmode is quite small as far as rq . 1. This is because, in such cases, there is a severe upper bound on\n\u039b to suppress the late time ISW effect which enhances Cl with small l. As a result, the quintessence\nfield cannot dominate the universe when z \u226b 1. Then, the isocurvature fluctuation in the quintessence\ndensity also becomes a minor effect until very recently. As one can see in Table 1, for the best-fit value\nof \u039b (i.e., for the Point A given in Fig. 2), the enhancement of C2 is about 2 % even for rQ = 2. If we\nconsider larger value of \u039b, effect on C2 is more enhanced. For (fQ , \u039b) = (5 \u00d7 1017 GeV, 3.0 \u00d7 10\u221212 GeV)\n(i.e., for the Point C given in Fig. 3, which is allowed at 99 % C.L.), we calculate the CMB angular power\nspectrum and the result is given in Fig. 3. In this case, C2 can be enhanced by the factor 2.6 if rQ = 2.\nOne should note that angular power spectrum of the CMB anisotropy strongly depends on the pri3\n\n3\n\n\f9\n8\n7\n\nCl/C10\n\n6\n\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\n\n5\n4\n3\n2\n\nrq = 0\n1.31\n1.45\n1.15\n0.84\n0.62\n\nrq = 0.5\n1.31\n1.46\n1.26\n1.33\n1.93\n\nrq = 1\n1.32\n1.48\n1.61\n2.80\n5.86\n\nrq = 1.5\n1.33\n1.51\n2.18\n5.25\n12.41\n\nrq = 2\n1.34\n1.56\n2.98\n8.69\n21.58\n\n1\n\nTable 1: C2 /C10 for several values of rq .

Thus, the constraint on the fQ vs. \u039b plane is sensitive to the\nscale-dependence of the primordial adiabatic fluctuation which is determined by the model of the inflation. Therefore, if we adopt a possibility of a non-trivial scale dependence of the primordial fluctuation,\nthe constraint on the fQ vs. \u039b plane given in the previous section may be relaxed or modified. If this is\nthe case, larger value of \u039b may be allowed and the energy density of the quintessence field may become\nsignificant at earlier stage of the universe.\n\n3\n\nConclusions and Discussion\n\nWe have studied the CMB anisotropies produced by cosine-type quintessence models. In particular,\neffects of the adiabatic and isocurvature fluctuations have been both discussed.\nFor purely adiabatic fluctuations with scale invariant spectrum, the existence of the quintessence\nsuppresses the relative height of the first acoustic peak of the angular power spectrum compared with\nthe \u039bCDM case. This is because, in the quintessence models, the \"dark energy\" due to the quintessence\nmay dominate the universe earlier than the cosmological constant case, and hence the late time ISW\neffect becomes more effective. As a result, the CMB anisotropy for large angular scale is more enhanced,\nwhich relatively suppresses the height of the acoustic peaks. Because of this effect, the CMB data from\nCOBE, BOOMERanG and MAXIMA have imposed the stringent constraint on the model parameters of\nthe quintessence models. We have also seen that the location of the the first acoustic peak shifts to lower\nmultipole l compared with \u039bCDM models.\nIn the case of the isocurvature fluctuations, we have shown that the isocurvature fluctuations have\nsignificant effects on the CMB angular power spectrum at low multipoles in some parameter space, which\nmay be detectable in future satellite experiments. Such effects is also seen in the tracker-type models\n[2]. This signal may be used to test the quitessence model, combining with the global shape of the CMB\nangular power spectrum.\n\nReferences\n[1] M. Kawasaki, T. Moroi and T. Takahashi, Phys. Rev.
