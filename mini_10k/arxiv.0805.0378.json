The physics of an antiferromagnetic state in\nthese materials has been a subject of much research.\nIn this article, I study response of electron states in an\nantiferromagnet to a weak magnetic field. I concentrate\non the simplest case: a commensurate collinear antiferromagnet, shown schematically in Fig. 1, where magnetisation density at any point is parallel or antiparallel to a\nsingle fixed direction n of staggered magnetisation, and\nchanges sign upon primitive translation of the underlying\nlattice.\nIn a paramagnet, double degeneracy of single-electron\neigenstates is usually attributed to symmetry under time\nreversal \u03b8 \u2013 and, indeed, perturbations that break \u03b8 (such\nas ferromagnetism or magnetic field) tend to remove the\ndegeneracy. Yet mere violation of \u03b8 does not preclude degeneracy: in a commensurate centrosymmetric N\u00e9el antiferromagnet, as in a paramagnet, all Bloch eigenstates\nenjoy Kramers degeneracy [8] in spite of time reversal\nbeing broken in the former, but not in the latter.\nIn an antiferromagnet, staggered magnetisation sets\na special direction n in electron spin space, making it\nanisotropic. Magnetic field along n removes the degeneracy, as it does in a paramagnet. By contrast, in a\ntransverse field, the symmetry remains high enough to\nprotect Kramers degeneracy at a special set of momenta.\nGenerally, in d spatial dimensions, full degeneracy manifold is (d \u2212 1)-dimensional; at its subset, degeneracy is\ndictated by symmetry. This is in marked contrast with\na paramagnet, where arbitrary magnetic field lifts the\ndegeneracy of all Bloch eigenstates.\nI show that, at a subset of the degeneracy manifold\nabove, it is a hidden anti-unitary symmetry that protects\nKramers degeneracy of Bloch states in a transverse field.\nThe degeneracy gives rise to a peculiar spin-orbit coupling, whose emergence and basic properties, along with\nthe degeneracy itself, are the main result of this work.\n\nKramers degeneracy of special Bloch states in a transverse field means, that the transverse component g\u22a5 of\nthe electron g-tensor vanishes for such states. Not being\nidentically equal to zero, g\u22a5 must, therefore, carry substantial momentum dependence, and the Zeeman coupling HZSO must take the form\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(1)\nHZSO = \u2212\u03bcB g|| (Hk * \u03c3) + g\u22a5 (p)(H\u22a5 * \u03c3) ,\nwhere H|| = (H * n)n and H\u22a5 = H \u2212 H|| are the longitudinal and the transverse components of the magnetic\nfield with respect to unit vector n of staggered magnetisation, \u03bcB is the Bohr magneton, while g|| and g\u22a5 (p) are\nthe longitudinal and the transverse components of the\ng-tensor.\nThis very momentum dependence of g\u22a5 (p) turns the\ncommon Zeeman coupling into a Zeeman spin-orbit interaction HZSO (1), whose appearance and key properties\nare at the focus of this work. Zeeman spin-orbit coupling\nmay manifest itself spectacularly in a number of ways,\nwhich will be mentioned below and discussed in detail\nelsewhere.\nSymmetry properties of wave functions in magnetic\ncrystals have been studied by Dimmock and Wheeler [9],\nwho pointed out, among other things, that magnetism\nnot only lifts degeneracies by obviously lowering the symmetry, but also may introduce new ones. This may happen at the magnetic Brillouin zone (MBZ) boundary, under the necessary condition that the magnetic unit cell\nbe larger, than the paramagnetic one [9].\nFor a N\u00e9el antiferromagnet on a square lattice, response of electron states to magnetic field was studied\nin [10] by symmetry analysis, and in [11] within a weak\ncoupling model. The present work revisits [10], extends\nit to an arbitrary crystal symmetry and shows, that the\npicture is more rich than envisaged by the authors. At\nthe same time, the present work extends [9] by allowing for external magnetic field \u2013 to show how, at special momenta, Kramers degeneracy may persist even in\na transverse magnetic field.\nAntiferromagnetic order couples to the electron spin \u03c3\nvia exchange term (\u2206r * \u03c3), where \u2206r is proportional to\n\n\f2\nthe average magnetisation density at point r. Nonzero\n\u2206r changes sign under time reversal \u03b8, and removes the\nsymmetry under primitive translations Ta , thus reducing\nthe symmetry with respect to that of paramagnetic state.\nIn a doubly commensurate collinear antiferromagnet, \u2206r\nchanges sign upon Ta : \u2206r+a = \u2212\u2206r , while T2a leaves\n\u2206r intact: \u2206r+2a = \u2206r . Even though neither \u03b8 nor Ta\nremain a symmetry, their product \u03b8Ta does (see Fig. 1).\nIn a system with inversion center, so does \u03b8Ta I, where\nI is inversion.\n\nIn a commensurate collinear antiferromagnet in magnetic field H, electron Hamiltonian has the form\nH = H0 + (\u2206r * \u03c3) \u2212 (H * \u03c3),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere 'paramagnetic' part H0 is invariant under independent action of Ta and \u03b8, and g\u03bcB is set to unity. In the\nabsence of the field, all Bloch eigenstates of Hamiltonian\n(3) enjoy Kramers degeneracy by virtue of Eqn. (2).\n\nn\n\n\u2206r, H\nl = n xh\nH\n\nh\n\nFIG. 1: (color online). Doubly commensurate collinear antiferromagnet on a simple rectangular lattice. In the absence\nof magnetism, time reversal \u03b8 and primitive translations Tx\nand Ty , shown by dashed arrows, are symmetry operations.\nIn the antiferromagnetic state, neither of the three remains\na symmetry, but the products \u03b8Tx and \u03b8Ty , shown by solid\narrows, do, as illustrated by filled spin arrows. Small dashed\nrectangle at the center is the Wigner-Seitz cell boundary in\nthe paramagnetic state, while the shaded hexagon is its antiferromagnetic counterpart. Notice that neither of the point\ngroup operations interchanges the two sublattices, hence any\npoint symmetry of the lattice, including inversion I, remains\na symmetry of the antiferromagnetic state.\n\nCombined anti-unitary symmetry \u03b8Ta I induces\nKramers degeneracy [8]: If |pi is a Bloch eigenstate\nat momentum p, then \u03b8Ta I|pi is degenerate with |pi.\nSince \u03b8 and I both invert the momentum, both |pi and\n\u03b8Ta I|pi carry the same momentum label p. At the\nsame time, |pi and \u03b8Ta I|pi are orthogonal: recalling\nthat (Ta I)2 = \u2212\u03b82 = 1, one finds [8]\nhp|\u03b8Ta I|pi = \u2212hp|\u03b8Ta I|pi.\n\n(2)\n\nThus, in spite of broken time reversal symmetry, in a\ncentrosymmetric commensurate N\u00e9el antiferromagnet all\nBloch states retain Kramers degeneracy.\nGenerally, magnetic field H lifts this degeneracy. However, in a purely transverse field, hidden anti-unitary\nsymmetry may protect the degeneracy at a special set\nof points in the Brillouin zone, as I show below.\n\n\u2206 r+a = \u2212 \u2206 r\n\nFIG. 2: (color online). Relative orientation of \u2206r , \u2206r+a , Hk\nand H\u22a5 . Notice that \u03b8 flips both \u2206r and H, while Ta leaves\nH intact, but inverts \u2206r .\n\nConsider symmetries of Hamiltonian (3), involving a\ncombination of an elementary translation Ta , time reversal \u03b8, or a spin rotation Um (\u03c6) around axis m by\nangle \u03c6. The relative orientation of \u2206r , Hk and H\u22a5 is\nshown in Fig. 2.\nTransverse field H\u22a5 breaks the symmetries Un (\u03c6) and\nTa \u03b8 (both change H\u22a5 ), but preserves Un (\u03c0)\u03b8Ta , their\ncombination at \u03c6 = \u03c0. Acting on the exact Bloch state\n|pi at momentum p, this combined anti-unitary operator creates a degenerate partner eigenstate Un (\u03c0)\u03b8Ta |pi,\nwhich is orthogonal to |pi everywhere in the Brillouin\nzone, unless p belongs to a paramagnetic Brillouin zone\nboundary:\nhp|Un (\u03c0)\u03b8Ta |pi = e\u22122ip*a hp|Un (\u03c0)\u03b8Ta |pi.\n\n(4)\n\nEquation (4) can be derived analogously to Eqn. (2) as\n2\nsoon as one observes, that [Un (\u03c0)\u03b8Ta ] = Ta 2 .\nNotice, however, that eigenstate Un (\u03c0)\u03b8Ta |pi carries\nmomentum label \u2212p rather than p. Generally, these two\nmomenta are different. However, an important exception\ntakes place at the magnetic Brillouin zone boundary, if\nthere is a unitary symmetry U, transforming \u2212p into\na momentum, equivalent to p modulo reciprocal lattice\nvector Q of the antiferromagnetic state [9]:\n\u2212 Up = p + Q.\n\n(5)\n\nIn this case, eigenstate UUn (\u03c0)\u03b8Ta |pi carries momentum label p + Q \u2261 p, is degenerate with |pi and orthog-\n\n\f3\nonal to it, thus explicitly demonstrating Kramers degeneracy at momentum p in a transverse field. In the simplest case, as in Fig. 3 below, U is the unity operator.\nAdditional insight into the locus of states, whose degeneracy persists in a transverse magnetic field, is afforded by weak-coupling Hamiltonian of a single electron\nin a doubly commensurate collinear antiferromagnet. Let\nQ be the antiferromagnetic ordering wave vector (see the\nexamples below); \u2206r creates a matrix element (\u2206 * \u03c3)\nbetween the Bloch states at momenta p and p + Q; for\nsimplicity, I neglect its possible dependence on p. In\nmagnetic field H, and at weak coupling, Hamiltonian (3)\ntakes the form [11]\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u01ebp \u2212 (H * \u03c3)\n(\u2206 * \u03c3)\n\uf8fb,\nH=\uf8f0\n(6)\n(\u2206 * \u03c3)\n\u01ebp+Q \u2212 (H * \u03c3)\nwhere \u01ebp and \u01ebp+Q are single-particle energies of H0 in\n(3) at momenta p and p + Q.\nIn a purely transverse field H\u22a5 , the spectrum of this\nHamiltonian is simply\nq\n2\n(7)\nEp = \u03b7p \u00b1 \u22062 + [\u03b6p \u2213 (H\u22a5 * \u03c3)] ,\n\u01eb +\u01eb\n\n\u01eb \u2212\u01eb\n\nwhere \u03b7p \u2261 p 2p+Q , and \u03b6p \u2261 p 2p+Q . Equation (7)\nillustrates several points. Firstly, at half-filling, a gap\nof size 2\u2206 opens at the chemical potential. Secondly, in\nthe absence of magnetic field, each eigenstate is indeed\ndoubly degenerate, in agreement with the arguments, encapsulated in Eqn. (2). Finally, Eqn. (7) shows, that the\ndegeneracy persists in a transverse field (and, therefore,\ng\u22a5 (p) in Eqn. (1) vanishes) whenever \u03b6p = 0. Barring a\nspecial situation, this equation defines a surface in three\ndimensions, a line in two, and a set of points in one. Furthermore, as shown above, this manifold must contain all\npoints, satisfying Eqn. (5).\nNotice that transverse magnetic field not only introduces the last term in Hamiltonian (3), but also tilts the\nsublattices. However, the resulting magnetisation has the\nsame symmetry as the field, and thus does not remove\nthe degeneracy.\nConsider examples. In one dimension, magnetic Bril\u03c0\n,\nlouin zone boundary reduces to two points p = \u00b1 2a\nwhich in fact coincide modulo antiferromagnetic wave\nvector Q = \u03c0a , that is also the reciprocal lattice vector of\nthe antiferromagnetic state (see Fig. 3). In terms of the\ngeneral condition (5), this is the simplest case: U = 1.\n\u03c0\n, the two exact Bloch states in\nAs a result, at p = \u00b1 2a\na transverse field, |pi and \u03b8Ta Un (\u03c0)|pi, correspond to\nthe same momentum p, and are degenerate by virtue of\n\u03b8Ta Un (\u03c0) being a symmetry. Equation (4) guarantees\ntheir orthogonality, thus protecting Kramers degeneracy\n\u03c0\nat momentum p = \u00b1 2a\nagainst transverse magnetic field.\nNow, consider a two-dimensional antiferromagnet of\nsimple rectangular symmetry, with the ordering wave\n\nFIG. 3: (color online).

In the antiferro\u03c0\nmagnetic state, the two points p = \u00b1 2a\nare identical modulo\nthe antiferromagnetic reciprocal lattice vector Q = \u03c0a . At\nthese two points, anti-unitary symmetry Un (\u03c0)Ta \u03b8 protects\nKramers degeneracy against transverse magnetic field.\n\nvector Q = (\u03c0, \u03c0), as shown in Fig.1. In a transverse\nmagnetic field, degeneracy persists at a line in the Brillouin zone, by virtue of Eqn. (7). I will show that, in\nthe rectangular case, the degeneracy line must contain\npoint \u03a3 (i.e. the star of point p = Q/2) at the center\nof the magnetic Brillouin zone boundary (see Fig. 4(a)).\nConsider a Bloch state |pi at momentum p in a trans-\n\nY\np\n\nM\n\u03a3\n\n\u0393\np' \u2212p' X X\n\u2212p\n\n(a)\n\nY\n\nM\n\np\n2\n\n1\n\n\u0393\n\n\u03a3\n\u03c32p\n\n\u2212p\n(b)\n\nFIG. 4: (color online).

At points \u03a3 (the star of p = Q/2),\nX, and Y, momenta p and \u2212p coincide modulo a recip-\n\n\f4\nrocal lattice vector of the antiferromagnetic state. However, at points X and Y (as well as at the entire vertical\nsegment of the MBZ boundary in Fig. 4(a)), (p * a) is an\ninteger multiple of \u03c0; hence |pi and \u03b8Ta Un (\u03c0)|pi are not\nobliged to be orthogonal there as per Eqn. (4). Thus, \u03a3\nis the only point at the MBZ boundary, where the two\ndegenerate states |pi and \u03b8Ta Un (\u03c0)|pi are orthogonal\nand correspond to the same momentum. Dashed arrows\nin figure 4(a) show, that, for a generic point p\u2032 at the\nMBZ boundary, no symmetry operation relates \u2212p\u2032 to\na vector, equivalent to p\u2032 . Hence it is only at point \u03a3,\nthat the symmetry protects Kramers degeneracy against\ntransverse magnetic field. As in the one-dimensional example above, in terms of Eqn. (5) this corresponds to\nthe simplest case of U = 1.\nPromotion from rectangular to square symmetry\nbrings along invariance under reflections \u03c31,2 in either\nof the two diagonal axes 1 and 2, passing through point\n\u0393 in Fig. 4(b). As a result, eigenstate \u03c31 \u03b8Ta Un (\u03c0)|pi at\nmomentum \u03c32 p (Fig. 4(b)) is also degenerate with |pi\nand orthogonal to it, as one can show analogously to the\nexamples above. In terms of general condition (5), this\nmeans U = \u03c31,2 .\nFor momentum p at the MBZ boundary in Fig. 4(b),\np and \u03c32 p differ by a reciprocal lattice vector and thus\ncoincide. Hence, for a square-symmetry lattice in a transverse field, Kramers degeneracy is protected by symmetry\nat the entire MBZ boundary, as shown in Fig. 4(b).\nDegeneracy of special Bloch states in a transverse field\nhinges only on the symmetry of the antiferromagnetic\nstate, and thus holds equally in a strongly correlated or a\nweakly coupled material \u2013 provided long-range antiferromagnetic order and well-defined electron quasiparticles.\nUnder these conditions, quantum fluctuations of the antiferromagnetic order primarily renormalize the sublattice\nmagnetisation, but leave intact the degeneracy of special electron states in a transverse field \u2013 certainly in the\nleading order in fluctuations.\nNow, g\u22a5 (p) can be expanded in a vicinity of the degeneracy line g\u22a5 (p) = 0. With the exception of highersymmetry points, such as point X in Fig. 4(b), the leading term of the expansion is linear in momentum deviation \u03b4p from the degeneracy line:\ng\u22a5 (p) \u2248\n\n\u039ep * \u03b4p\n,\n~\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u039ep /~ is momentum gradient of g\u22a5 (p) at point\np on the degeneracy line. Inversion symmetry requires,\nthat \u039ep be a pseudo-vector and change sign upon inversion, and Eqn. (7) shows, that \u039ep is of the order of the\nantiferromagnetic coherence length \u03be \u223c ~v\u2206F .\nZeeman spin-orbit coupling (1) induces a number of\n\ninteresting effects. For instance, substantial momentum\ndependence of g\u22a5 (p) means, that the Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) frequency of a carrier in a vicinity of the degeneracy line varies along the quasiclassical trajectory. In\na weakly doped antiferromagnetic insulator, this means\ninherent broadening of the ESR line with doping and,\neventually, loss of the ESR signal. In fact, this may well\nbe the reason behind the long-known 'ESR silence' [12]\nof the cuprates. Suppression of transverse Pauli susceptibility is another simple consequence of vanishing g\u22a5 (p).\nFinally, momentum dependence of g\u22a5 (p) allows excitation of spin flip transitions by AC electric rather than\nmagnetic field [13] \u2013 a vivid effect of great promise for\ncontrolled spin manipulation, so much sought after in\nspin electronics. Its absorption matrix elements are defined by \u039ep \u223c \u03be of Eqn. (8), and exceed those of ESR at\nleast by two orders of magnitude. According to Eqn. (8),\nresonance absorption in this phenomenon shows a nontrivial dependence on the orientation of the AC electric\nfield with respect to the crystal axes, and on the orientation of the DC magnetic field with respect to staggered\nmagnetisation.\nI thank LPTMS for kind hospitality, and IFRAF for\ngenerous support.\n\n[1] E.
