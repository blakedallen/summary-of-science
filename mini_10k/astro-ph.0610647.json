Introduction\nThe variability of DO Cas was discovered in 1940 by Hoffmeister (1947). In his 1947 paper,\nHoffmeister concluded the \u03b2 Lyrae type of the variable from a series of visual observations. The\nstar's J2000 coordinates are R.A.= 02h41m24s, Dec.= +60\u00b033'11'' , and it has the following\ncatalogue designations: HD 16506 , BD +59 \u030a529 , SAO 12388 , HIC 12543 , Pickering 023360.\nThe spectral type of the primary was classified to be A2 (Henry Draper Catalogue), A2II\n(Fehrenbach et al., 1966), and A4-A5 (Hill et al., 1975). Also the spectral type of the secondary was\nestimated as F2 by Koch (1973).\nConcerning the nature of the system, Schneller and Daene (1952), Cester et al. (1977), Kaluzny\n(1985), Rovithis-Livaniou and Rovithis (1986), Oh and Ahn (1992), Kim et al. (1999), and Oh and\nOh (2000) have concluded that it is a contact binary while Giannone and Giannuzzi (1974), and Liu\net al. (1988) have specified a semi-detached classification.\nThe results of the present analysis support the contact binary classification.\nThis eclipsing binary has been observed by many observers such as Winkler (1966), Kukarkin et al.\n(1969), Gleim and Winkler (1969), Aluigi et al. (1995), Oh and Kim (1996), and the others\nmentioned above. A summery of the spectroscopic elements for DO Cas is given by Kranjc (1960)\nand the single-line spectroscopic data were obtained by Mannino (1958), who mentioned that the\norbit of the system has an eccentricity of 0.12. However, Kaluzny (1985) commented that such a\nlarge eccentricity is suspicious.\nIn this study, I am presenting the light curves of DO Cas in the two Johnson filters B and V. I\nanalyzed these light curves using the Wilson program, and the parameters derived from observed\nlight curves are compared with the previous studies.\nThe purpose of the present work is to present new photoelectric times of minimum light, to make a\nperiod study of this system and to derive new light elements.\n\n1\n\n\f2. Observations\nA total of 473 blue and 474 yellow photoelectric observations of DO Cas were carried out during 6\nnights from December 2000 to January 2001 with the 51 cm cassegrian telescope of Biruni\nObservatory, Shiraz, Iran, as listed with all the corrections in Table 1 and Table 2 along with the JD\nand corresponding phase value. The telescope is equipped with an un-refrigerated RCA4509\nmultiplier phototube operating at 1600 Volts and with the B and V filters matched to Johnson UBV\nsystem. The readings were amplified and digitized through an A/D converter and a personal\ncomputer was used to handle and reduce the data.\nThe observing sequence was the usual pattern of sky \u2013 comparison \u2013 variable (4 times) \u2013 comparison\n\u2013 sky, with each observation lasting about 10 seconds.\nThe comparison star used for the observations was BD+59\u00b0521 (HD 16088, SAO 23474, HIC 1228)\nwhich is the same one as used by Aluigi et al. (1995). The J2000 coordinates for this star are:\nR.A. = 02h37m26s, Dec. = +60\u00b005'18'', respectively. The check star wasn't observed, because no\nappreciable variation was detected.\nAll observations were corrected for differential atmospheric extinction effects using the extinction\ncoefficients were determined from the observations of the comparison star by using a reduction\ncomputer program which is known as Redwip code, written by G.McCook.\nThe average values for the extinction coefficients were 0.298 in blue light and 0.196 in yellow light.\nThe phases have been computed using Koch et al. (1963) ephemeris formulae.

The period given by Gleim and Winkler (1969) also differs at the forth decimal\nplace, however, other periods, except the Hoffmeister's one, show consistency up to fifth decimal\nplace.\nThe light curves are calculated according to the ephemeris of Koch et al. (1963), and the diagram of\nthe differences between the observed and the computed (O-C) times of primary minima versus cycle\nnumbers, presented in Figure 4, has been obtained from all times of minima published so far,\naccording to this ephemeris.

The O-C Diagram of DO Cas from the weighted times of minima\nSince each point in the new diagram shows a small disordered scatter up to a value of 0d.009, the\nperiod of the system seems to be constant.\nHowever some sine terms in ephemeris were introduced by Oh and Kim (1996), concluded that the\npossible explanation for these small (O-C) variation of the system DO Cas is the hypothesis of a\nthird-body, with 0.082 solar mass and a period of 18.7 years, revolving around the close binary.\nAt this stage of the orbital period analysis, the possibility of the sine variation of the orbital period in\nDO Cas has been restudied according to the latest computed (O-C) diagram, shown in Figure 5.\nFigure 6 represents this (O-C) diagram along the sine curve fitted. It's clear that the curve doesn't fit\nwell and is totally in error.\nMoreover, the square of the correlation coefficient for this fitting is 0.1924 which shows the\ninsufficient quality for the fitting and it doesn't agree with the sine terms they suggested.\nTherefore, a constant orbital period is the most possible suggestion for the system DO Cas at this\nmoment.\ny = a + bsin(2\u03c0x /d + c)\na=0.000862, b=-0.001928, c=2.845094, d=9298.327\n\nFigure 6.

The\nmodel, which the program is based on, has been described and quantified in papers by Wilson (1971,\n1990, and 1998).\nSince the system DO Cas had been mentioned as both a contact and a semi-detached binary by\nprevious studies, the solution was separately performed in modes 2 (detached mode) and 3 (contact\nmode) of LC code. In my analysis, I assumed a value of zero for the third light as well.\nDO Cas is also a single-lined spectroscopic binary (Mannino 1958), and so the spectroscopic orbit\ncan not provide the mass ratio q = M2/M1 directly. Therefore, the solutions for several assumed\nvalues of mass ratio q (q=0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6) were obtained.\nBased on the spectral type A2 for the primary component of DO Cas (Henry Draper Catalogue), the\ntemperature was estimated to be 9200K for star1 (primary). The gravity-darkening g1=1 and g2=0.32,\nand the bolometric albedo A1=1 and A2=0.5 were assumed according to the pervious studies. The\nadjustable parameters were: the inclination i, the mean temperature of star2, T2, the monochromatic\nluminosity of star1, L1, and the dimensionless potentials of star1 and star2, \u03a91 and \u03a92.\nUsing the LC program of Wilson, I calculated the theoretical light curves by means of the\nphotometric elements of the best solution at q=0.315 and mode 2 and plotted them together with the\nobservational data as shown below.\n\n1.1\n\n0.9\n\n1.1\n\n0.9\n\nTheoretical and Observational Light Curves\nin Filter V\n\n0.7\n\nTheoretical and Observational Light Curves\nin Filter B\n\n0.7\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n0.6\nNormal.

Discussion and Conclusions\nThe present study has shown that the system DO Cas is a contact binary with a large temperature\ndifference between the two components.\nTo compare with the 1977 and 1999 observations published by Cester et al. and Kim et al. respectively,\nI also showed their results in table 6. It is very clear that the mass ratio, q, of DO Cas has changed in\nthe time interval between 1977 an 2001 that may be explained by mass transfer which is taking place\nbetween the two components. It does agree with a B-type contact binary system which has been\nmentioned by some authors.\nIt can also be seen from the light curves in Figure 1, the Primary minimum shows a transit, whereas\nthe secondary minimum shows an occultation.\nIt showed in period study that the period of the system remains constant. However Oh and Kim\n(1996) indicated that the orbital period of the system is changing in a sinusoidal character. There are\ntwo simple mechanisms which explain such periodic orbital period variations of eclipsing binary\nsystems: (i) a third body, and (ii) apsidal motion. Apsidal motion is unlikely in the case of DO Cas,\nsince the orbital eccentricity of DO Cas is obtained zero.\nTherefore, the third body hypothesis could explain the sinusoidal variation of the orbital period of\nDO Cas, if exist. However, such a sinusoidal variation is not acceptable yet due to the insufficient\nfitting shown in figure 6. It might be investigated by more times of minimum to obtain a more\naccurate O-C diagram in future.\nUnfortunately there are gaps that span many years in these data so it is difficult to follow the long\nterm period trends. There is also some uncertainty in the exact timing of some of the eclipses; for\nexample there were two different times of minimum for one cycle each recorded, and published\nwhich differed about an hour and twenty minutes.\nHence, at present, it is difficult to say that the third body is present in the system or not.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI would like to thank M.
