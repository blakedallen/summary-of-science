While emission-line observations form the core of the SWAS\nprogram on interstellar water vapor, absorption-line observations are possible toward a few\nbright continuum sources; these include Sagittarius B2 (Neufeld et al. 2000b; hereafter N00),\nSagittarius A, W49, and W51. Absorption-line observations typically probe the water vapor\nabundance in several kinematically-distinct foreground clouds lying along the line-of-sight to\nthe source (e.g. N00). Under typical interstellar conditions, most water molecules are in the\nlower state of the 110 \u2212101 transition (i.e. in the ground state of ortho-water); thus absorption\nline observations have the distinct advantage of yielding water vapor column densities that\nare insensitive both to the physical conditions in the absorbing cloud and to the assumed\nrate coefficients for collisional excitation of water. Typically, the H16\n2 O absorption line is very\noptically-thick, yielding only a lower limit on the water column density, but observations of\noptically-thin absorption by the H18\n2 O isotopologue (less abundant by a factor of 250\u2013500)\nhave led to a quantitative determination of the water column densities in foreground clouds\nalong the Sgr B2 sight-line (N00).\nIn this Letter, we report the results of similar observations carried out towards the\nstar-forming region W51. The results are particularly intriguing, because they provide our\nfirst detection of a H16\n2 O absorption line which is of only moderate optical depth. This\nfeature, observed at an LSR velocity \u223c 6 km s\u22121 , originates in a diffuse foreground cloud\nin the which the water column density is small. This cloud has previously been detected by\nmeans of 21 cm absorption-line observations (Koo 1997): the inferred HI column density is\n\u223c 1021 cm\u22122 .\nSpaans et al. (1998; hereafter S98) have argued that measurements of OH and H2 O\ncolumn densities in diffuse clouds provide a valuable probe of the chemistry of interstellar\noxygen molecules; in particular, the OH/H2 O abundance ratio serves to constrain the branching ratio for the dissociative recombination of the molecular ion H3 O+ , a crucial parameter\nin chemical models for both diffuse and dense molecular clouds. Accordingly, we have used\nthe Arecibo Observatory (AO) to carry out OH absorption line observations toward the same\nsource, the results of which are also presented here.\nThe observations and data reduction are described in \u00a72 below, and the observational\nresults presented in \u00a73. In \u00a74 we discuss the derived water and OH column densities and the\nconstraints that they place upon the oxygen chemistry in molecular clouds.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nOur SWAS observations of W51 were carried out during the period 1999 April 16 \u2013 2001\nApril 19 with the 3.3\u2032 \u00d7 4.5\u2032 elliptical SWAS beam centered at position \u03b1 = 19h 23m 43.s 0,\n\u03b4 = 14\u25e6 30\u2032 38\u2032\u2032 (J2000). All the data were acquired in standard nodded observations (Melnick\net al. 2000) and were reduced using the standard SWAS pipeline. The total on-source\nintegration time was 58.6 hours.\nAO observations of the 1612, 1665, 1667, and 1720 MHz lines of OH were obtained on\n2001 November 30 and 2001 December 3 towards the SWAS-observed position and nine offset\npositions of widely varying continuum flux. The goal of observing OH towards these offset\npositions was to allow inferences to be drawn about the line excitation temperatures (see \u00a73.2\nbelow). The offsets and on-source integration times for each observed position are given in\nTable 1, all positional offsets being expressed relative to the SWAS-observed position. The\nAO data were obtained in a series of standard nodded observations in which the source and\nreference positions were alternately observed for a period of 5 minutes each. The reference\nposition was chosen to have an R.A. offset of \u20135 (cos \u03b4) minutes of time so that the source and\nreference positions were observed over identical tracks in azimuth and elevation. Calibration\nmeasurements were carried out using the noise diode after each source/reference position\npair, and calibration observations of an astronomical continuum source were performed at\nthe beginning of each day's observations.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nResults\n\nSWAS observations of water vapor\n\nFigure 1 shows the complete spectrum of the 110 \u2212 101 556.936 GHz transition of H2 O\n\u2217\nobtained by SWAS toward W51. The continuum antenna temperature, TAC\n, measured\ntoward W51 was 0.35 K (double sideband), corresponding to a 550 GHz continuum flux\ndensity of 2.5 \u00d7 103 Jy. The quantity plotted in Figure 1 is the ratio of flux density to\n\u2217\n\u2217\ncontinuum flux density, given by [TA\u2217 \u2212 0.5 TAC\n]/ 0.5 TAC\nunder the assumption that the\n\u2032\nsideband gains are equal. The SWAS beam size is 3.3 \u00d7 4.5\u2032 (FWHM) at 550 GHz. The\nfitted line at vLSR \u223c 6 km s\u22121 is the best-fit absorption line for a cloud that is assumed to\ncompletely cover the source. The derived cloud parameters are a line center optical depth \u03c40\nof 1.5, a Doppler parameter6 b of 1.5 km s\u22121 , and cloud LSR velocity of 6.0 km s\u22121 . Under\n6\n\nThe Doppler parameter b is defined (as usual) such that the optical depth drops by a factor e=2.718... at\na velocity shift b from line center. The corresponding FWHM obtained from a Gaussian fit to the absorption\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nthe conditions typical of diffuse interstellar clouds, the population in the 110 rotational state\nof water is very small and thus the effects of stimulated emission on the 110 \u2212 101 optical\ndepth can be neglected. The column density of water in the 101 state is straightforwardly\nobtained as 1.9 \u00d7 1013 cm\u22122 . If the ortho-para ratio for water is 3, the implied total water\ncolumn density is 2.5 \u00d7 1013 cm\u22122 . The water abundance relative to HI is \u223c 10\u22128 .\n\n3.2.\n\nArecibo observations of OH\n\nFigure 2 shows the OH spectra obtained at AO towards the ten positions observed\nin W51. These spectra show the ratio of beam-averaged brightness temperature, TB , to\ncontinuum brightness temperature, TBC . The beam-averaged brightness temperature of the\nradiation incident upon the AO antenna is computed according to TB = TA /\u03b7A +TCMB , where\nTA is the antenna temperature, \u03b7A \u223c 0.8 is the aperture efficiency \u2013 including atmospheric\nlosses, as determined from calibration observations of an astronomical continuum source \u2013\nand TCMB = 2.73 K is the temperature of the cosmic background radiation (which is \"chopped\nout\" by our observing procedure). The size of the Arecibo main beam is \u223c 2.6\u2032 \u00d73.0\u2032 (FWHM)\nat 1666 MHz.\nThe continuum brightness temperatures, TBC , measured for each position are shown in\nTable 1, along with the measured equivalent width, Wv \u2013 in units of km s\u22121 \u2013 for each of the\nR\nobserved OH lines. Here, Wv is defined as (TB \u2212 TBC )/TBC ] dv, so that a negative value of\nWv implies an absorption line and a positive value an emission line. Because of strong radio\nfrequency interference, the 1720 MHz line strength could be measured reliably only toward\nthe SWAS-observed (0,0) position where the absolute line strength was largest.\nThe results shown in Table 1 imply that the ratio of equivalent widths departs greatly\nfrom the 1:5:9:1 value expected in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) for Wv (1612) :\nWv (1665) : Wv (1667) : Wv (1720). In particular, the 1665 MHz / 1667 MHz absorption\nline ratio is considerably smaller than the LTE value and the 1612 MHz / 1667 MHz ratio\nconsiderably larger. Moreover, the 1720 MHz line is observed in emission toward the (0,0)\nposition, indicating the presence of weak maser amplification.\nFor lines of small optical depth, the equivalent width is related to the OH column density\nand the excitation temperature, Tex , by the expression\nWv = 0.45 k [N(OH)/1014 cm\u22122 ] [Tex /K]\u22121 [1 \u2212 Tex /TBC ] km s\u22121\nline is 3.4 km s\u22121 .\n\n(1)\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nwhere k = 91 , 95 , 1 and 19 respectively for the 1612, 1665, 1667 and 1720 MHz transitions.\nThe ratios and signs of the equivalent widths observed toward the (0,0) position imply that\nTex (1720) < 0 < Tex (1612) < Tex (1667) < Tex (1665). Assuming that all the excitation\ntemperatures are small compared to TBC at the (0,0) position (i.e. small compared to\n500 K), we find the ratio of excitation temperatures to be Tex (1612) : Tex (1665) : Tex (1667) :\nTex (1720) = 0.18 : 1.79 : 1 : \u22120.29.\nUnfortunately, because the equivalent widths are a function of two unknowns \u2013 N(OH)\nand Tex \u2013 the OH column density and excitation cannot be derived independently for any\ngiven sight-line. However, as we argue below, the variation of the equivalent widths with\nthe background continuum brightness temperature, TBC , for the ten sight-lines we observed,\nprovides a strong argument that the entire region is covered by a large foreground cloud in\nwhich the OH column density and excitation are nearly constant. This in turn allows us to\nderive an estimate of N(OH).\nIn Figure 3 (upper panel), we show the equivalent widths measured for each transition\nand each observed position as a function of the background continuum brightness temperature, TBC . We note immediately that the equivalent width of the 1612 MHz transition shows\nrather little variation over the entire set of observed positions; Wv (1612) lies within 30% of\n0.08 km s\u22121 for every sight-line that we observed. Referring to equation (1), we see that the\nnear-constancy of Wv argues strongly that N(OH) and Tex are nearly constant and that Tex\nis small compared to 6 K, the smallest TBC for any sight-line that we observed. In principle,\nof course, N(OH) and Tex could show large variations from one position to another, but it\nwould seem highly improbable that such variations could conspire to yield a right-hand-side\nfor equation (1) that is nearly constant. Therefore, we shall henceforth assume that the OH\ncolumn density and excitation are nearly the same towards each of the ten positions we have\nobserved.\nIt is also apparent from Figure 3 that the equivalent widths of the 1665 MHz and\nperhaps the 1667 MHz transition appear to show a systematic decline in those sight-lines\nof smallest continuum brightness; this decline allows the line excitation temperatures to be\nestimated. In Figure 3 (lower panel), we plot the ratio of equivalent widths for the 1665 and\n1612 MHz transitions, again as a function of the background brightness temperature. The\nsolid curve shows the best fit to the data, for a model in which the 1612 and 1665 excitation\ntemperatures are assumed to be constant and in the 0.1:1 ratio inferred for the (0,0) position.\nThe best fit curve is obtained for Tex (1665) = 7 K. Adopting this value for Tex (1665), we\ninfer from equation (1) and the observed 1665 MHz equivalent width that the OH column\ndensity is 8 \u00d7 1013 cm\u22122 towards the SWAS-observed (0,0) position.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n4.\n\nDiscussion\n\nBecause of the relative simplicity of the chemical networks involved, diffuse molecular clouds provide a useful laboratory for testing astrochemical models; in particular, the\nH2 O/OH abundance ratio serves as a valuable probe of the chemical network that produces\noxygen-bearing molecules (S98). One key uncertainty in that network concerns the dissociative recombination of H3 O+ with electrons, and specifically the fraction of such recombinations that produce water, fH2 O , a quantity for which two laboratory groups have obtained\nhighly discrepant results. According to results obtained in the flowing afterglow experiment\nof Williams et al. (1996), a fraction fOH = 0.65 of dissociative recombinations of H3 O+ lead\nto OH, a fraction fH2 O = 0.05 to H2 O, and the remaining fraction fO = 1 \u2212 fOH \u2212 fH2 O to O.\nA different experimental technique (Vejby-Christensen et al. 1997), which made use of the\nASTRID heavy-ion storage ring in Denmark, yielded significantly different results (Jensen\net al. 2000), viz. fOH : fH2 O : fO = 0.74 \u00b1 0.02 : 0.25 \u00b1 0.01 : 0.013 \u00b1 0.005. Similar results\n(although with larger error bars) were obtained (Neau et al. 2000) from the CRYRING heavyion storage ring facility; they were fOH : fH2 O : fO = 0.78 \u00b1 0.08 : 0.18 \u00b1 0.05 : 0.04 \u00b1 0.06,\nTaken together with the ground-based observations of OH that we obtained at Arecibo,\nthe SWAS observations of W51 imply an H2 O/OH abundance ratio \u223c 0.3 in the diffuse\ncloud that is responsible for the vLSR = 6 km s\u22121 feature. Considering the uncertainties\nin our determination of the H2 O and (particularly) the OH column densities, we estimate\nthe H2 O/OH ratio to be uncertain by a factor \u223c 2. In comparing the observed H2 O/OH\nabundance ratio with theoretical predictions, we have used the steady-state photodissociation\nregion (PDR) model of Kaufman et al. (1999), modified so as to treat the case of a finite\nslab illuminated from two sides. Because H2 and CO are photodissociated following line\nabsorption, their photodissociation rates are reduced by self-shielding. In order to treat\ncorrectly the effects of self-shielding for radiation incident upon both sides of the slab, the\nH2 and CO abundances must be obtained by an iterative method.\n\n4.1.\n\nStandard models of cold diffuse clouds\n\nIn Figure 4, we show the predicted H2 O and OH column densities for a variety of\nastrophysical parameters: the total visual extinction through the cloud, AV , in magnitudes;\nthe illuminating UV field, G0 , in units of the Habing field; and the cosmic ray ionization\nrate, \u03b6cr . All results apply to an assumed cloud density, nH , of 100 H nucleons per cm3 .\nThe temperature is calculated from considerations of thermal balance and is \u223c 30 K at the\ncloud center. Filled squares apply to models with fOH : fH2 O : fO = 0.75 : 0.25 : 0.0 (values\nsuggested by the ASTRID storage ring experiment), while filled triangles apply to models\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nwith fOH : fH2 O : fO = 0.65 : 0.05 : 0.30 (suggested by the flowing afterglow experiment).\nThe different astrophysical parameters for each plotted data point are described in the figure\ncaption. Black circles represent the column densities observed toward W51 and HD 154368.\nA striking feature of Figure 4 is that although the H2 O and OH column densities depend\nstrongly on the assumed astrophysical parameters, their ratio is determined primarily by the\nassumed branching ratio fH2 O and shows almost no dependence upon AV , G0 , or \u03b6cr . This\nbehavior can be understood by means of a simple \"toy\" model, in which we assume OH and\nH2 O to be formed by dissociative recombination of H3 O+ and destroyed by photodissociation.\nThe expected H2 O/OH ratio is given by\nn(H2 O)\nfH2 O\nfH2 O\n\u03b6OH\n\u00d7\n\u223c 0.69 \u00d7\n=\nn(OH)\n\u03b6H2O fOH + fH2 O\nfOH + fH2 O\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b6OH = 3.5 \u00d7 10\u221210 G0 exp(\u22121.7 AV ) s\u22121 and \u03b6H2O = 5.1 \u00d7 10\u221210 G0 exp(\u22121.8 AV ) s\u22121 are\nthe assumed photodissociation rates for OH and H2 O (Roberge et al. 1991).7 Equation (2)\nyields H2 O/OH abundance ratios of 0.172 and 0.049 respectively for the branching ratios\nassumed for the filled squares and triangles in Figure 4. These ratios are shown by dashed\nlines in Figure 4, and do indeed yield good agreement with results from the full steadystate PDR model. The assumption of chemical steady-state is justified by the fact that the\nphotodissociation timescale for OH is only \u223c 100 exp(1.7 AV )/G0 years.\nGiven standard models for cold diffuse clouds, the observed H2 O/OH abundance ratio\nof \u223c 0.3 in W51 is consistent with the case fOH : fH2 O : fO = 0.75 : 0.25 : 0 and clearly\ninconsistent with the case fOH : fH2 O : fO = 0.65 : 0.05 : 0.30. Thus \u2013 if interpreted using\nstandard models for cold diffuse clouds \u2013 the observed H2 O/OH abundance ratio argues for\nthe laboratory results obtained in the ASTRID storage ring experiment and against those\nobtained in the flowing afterglow experiment.\nThis conclusion, however, is different from that obtained by S98, who used ultraviolet\nabsorption line observations with the Goddard High Resolution Spectrometer of HST to\nplace an upper limit of only 0.06 (3 \u03c3) on the H2 O/OH ratio in an entirely different diffuse\ncloud, which lies in front of the star HD 154368. Based upon these observations, S98 argued\nfor a low value of fH2 O that is inconsistent with the ASTRID storage ring experiment. The\npuzzling discrepancy between the observed H2 O/OH abundance ratio in these two diffuse\nclouds may point to the importance of additional production mechanisms for OH or H2 O\nthat do not involve the dissociative recombination of H3 O+ . This possibility is addressed in\n\u00a74.2 below.\n7\n\nThe quantity fH2 O appears with fOH in the denominator of the second term on the right-hand-side,\nbecause photodestruction of H2 O results in the formation of OH.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n4.2.\n\nEnhanced-temperature models of diffuse molecular clouds\n\nIt has long been recognized (e.g. Elitzur & de Jong 1978) that neutral-neutral reactions\nprovide an alternate production route to OH and H2 O. The reactions\nO + H2 \u2192 OH + H\n\n(3)\n\nOH + H2 \u2192 H2 O + H\n\n(4)\n\npossess activation barriers that make them negligibly slow at the low temperatures typical of\ndiffuse interstellar clouds; at temperatures above \u223c 300 K, however, they become important\nproduction mechanisms for OH and H2 O (Neufeld, Lepp & Melnick 1995). If even a small\nfraction of the gas in the W51 6 km s\u22121 and/or the HD 154368 cloud were sufficiently warm\n\u2013 as a result of a weak shock, for example \u2013 then neutral-neutral reactions might perturb\nthe OH and H2 O column densities.\nTo investigate this possibility, we have obtained model predictions for PDRs in which the\ntemperature has been fixed at a variety of temperatures between 100 and 1500 K. The results\nare represented by the magenta locus in Figure 4; they were obtained for the astrophysical\nparameters adopted by S98 for the HD 154368 cloud \u2013 AV = 2.65 mag, nH = 325 cm\u22123 , G0 =\n3 \u2013 but for a branching ratio fH2 O = 0.25 and a cosmic ray ionization rate of 1.8\u00d710\u221217 cm\u22123 .\nThe OH and H2 O column densities are both clearly enhanced by neutral-neutral reactions. At\nmoderate temperatures, the H2 O/OH ratio decreases because the large O/OH ratio makes\nreaction (3) more important than (4). At temperatures higher than \u223c 600 K, however,\nthe effect on the ratio is reversed, and the H2 O/OH ratio is increased by neutral-neutral\nreactions.\nThe results obtained in enhanced-temperature models suggest a way out of the puzzle\nposed by the discrepant OH/H2 O ratios measured in the W51 6 km s\u22121 and HD 154368\nclouds. If these clouds possess small (but differing) amounts of warm gas, then the OH/H2 O\nabundance ratios could differ (even though the value of fH2 O must, of course, be identical\nin both clouds). We are unaware of any observations that rule out the presence of small\namounts of warm gas in these sources; indeed, the presence of such gas in diffuse clouds\nis predicted by certain models that seek to explain the anomalously-high CH+ abundances\nobserved in many diffuse clouds as resulting from the effects of turbulence or weak shocks8\n(e.g. Joulain et al. 1998, Flower & Pineau des Forets 1998, and references therein).\n8\n\nDepending upon the geometry, velocity shifts of the OH and H2 O lines relative to the lines of other\nspecies (e.g. HI) might be an observational signature of a shock production mechanism. The velocity shifts\ncan be very small, however, if the shock propagates at an oblique angle to the line-of-sight or if multiple\nshocks are present in the beam. Thus, the absence of any such signature in the W51 6 km s\u22121 cloud does\nnot argue strongly against the production of OH and H2 O in shocks.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nUnfortunately \u2013 as discussed above \u2013 the effect of warm gas upon the H2 O/OH ratio\ndepends critically upon the gas temperature \u2013 and even switches sign at T \u223c 600 K. Thus,\nif warm gas is present, the observed H2 O/OH ratio cannot even be used to derive a limit\nupon fH2 O . For example, if \u223c 5% of the gas in HD 154368 were at \u223c 500 K, then the\nobservations of OH and H2 O in that source could be reconciled with the large branching\nratio fH2 O = 0.25 derived in \u00a74.1 above. Alternatively, if \u223c 0.3% of the gas in the W51 cloud\nwere at T \u223c 700 K, then the observed H2 O/OH ratio would be consistent with the lower\nlimit on fH2 O inferred previously by S98.\nTo summarize, the discrepancy between the H2 O/OH ratio reported here for the W51\n6 km s\u22121 cloud and that reported previously for the HD 154368 cloud (S98) suggests that a\n>\ncomponent of warm (T \u223c\n400) gas is present in one or both of these sources. The presence\nof this warm component makes it difficult to determine observationally the branching ratio\nfor the dissociative recombination of H3 O+ with electrons to form OH and H2 O. Our new\nobservations of W51 cast doubt upon the conclusion of S98 that the branching ratio to H2 O\nis small, but do not allow the branching ratio to be determined definitively.\nThis work was supported NASA's SWAS contract NAS5-30702.
