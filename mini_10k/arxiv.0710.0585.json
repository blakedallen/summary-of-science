We describe efforts over the last six years to implement regularization methods\nsuitable for studying one or more interacting black holes by direct N-body simulations. Three\ndifferent methods have been adapted to large-N systems: (i) Time-Transformed Leapfrog, (ii)\nWheel-Spoke, and (iii) Algorithmic Regularization. These methods have been tried out with\nsome success on GRAPE-type computers. Special emphasis has also been devoted to including\npost-Newtonian terms, with application to moderately massive black holes in stellar clusters.\nSome examples of simulations leading to coalescence by gravitational radiation will be presented\nto illustrate the practical usefulness of such methods.\nKeywords. Celestial mechanics, methods: n-body simulations\n\n1. The chain concept\nIn the study of strong gravitational interactions, utilization of the chain data structure can be very beneficial. Over many years, the original chain regularization method\n(Mikkola & Aarseth 1993) has proved to be effective in star cluster simulations containing binaries. As we shall see in the following, it is also a useful tool in connection with\ntime transformations which do not employ the usual coordinates. By introducing one\nor more dominant masses these advantages become more apparent. Such problems fall\nnaturally into three classes according to the number of massive objects and each class\nrequires special attention. At the simplest level we have the case of one central massive\nbody which dominates the motion of other members within a certain distance. The role\nof the reference body is readily seen in the case of three interacting particles which can be\nstudied by three-body regularization (Aarseth & Zare 1974). This idea was extended to\nan arbitrary membership (Zare 1974). However, a natural application was lacking until\nthe problem of black holes (BHs) became a challenge for simulators in recent years. The\naptly named wheel-spoke regularization (Aarseth 2003a) has now been adapted to study\ncompact subsystems containing a single massive object.\nHistorically speaking, a special method for a BH binary was implemented in an N body code first. Here the main idea is based on a time-transformed leapfrog scheme (TTL)\nsuitable for dealing with large mass ratios (Mikkola & Aarseth 2002). Remarkably, this\nmethod yields machine precision for unperturbed two-body motion. Although regularized\nchain coordinates are not employed directly, the accuracy is improved by using relative\nquantities with respect to the nearest massive body.\nAlternative methods may be needed for problems involving more than two massive objects. The recent algorithmic regularization (Mikkola & Tanikawa 1999, Preto & Tremaine\n1999, Mikkola & Merritt 2006) appears to be a promising way of studying such systems.\nIndeed, the masses only play a kinematical role in one formulation, suggesting that it\nmay be applicable to systems with large mass ratios. However, it should be emphasized\nthat for practical reasons any of the above methods are of necessity limited to relatively\nsmall particle numbers, or in other words, compact subsystems.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nSverre Aarseth\n\n2. Post-Newtonian formulation\nRelativistic effects in stellar systems are usually associated with high densities or very\nmassive objects. However, quite large values of the eccentricity may also occur for certain\ntypes of initial conditions (Aarseth 2003b, Berczik et al. 2006, Iwasawa, Funato & Makino\n2006) such that the orbital shrinkage by gravitational wave emission becomes significant.\nThis stage is characterized by velocities reaching an appreciable fraction of the speed of\nlight, c. The original expressions for modelling post-Newtonian effects (Soffel 1989) were\nsubsequently replaced by an equivalent scheme which facilitates the evaluation of consistent two-body elements (Blanchet & Iyer 2003, Mora & Will 2004). This development\nenables the equation of motion to be written in the concise form\ni\nr\nd2 r\nMh\n(\u22121\n+\nA)\n=\n+\nBv\n,\n(2.1)\ndt2\nr2\nr\nwhere the scaled quantities A, B represent the post-Newtonian terms. An expansion of\nincreasing complexity up to 1/c6 is available for implementation.\nGiven the perturbing force FGR , the corresponding energy loss can be obtained by\nintegrating FGR * vdt in regularized form. Here the secular change is due to gravitational wave radiation represented by the terms A5/2 , B5/2 , while the two first orders are\nconnected with precession. The radiation time-scale in N -body units is (Peters 1964)\ntGR =\n\n(1 \u2212 e2 )7/2\n5c5 a4\n,\n64mi m0 (mi + m0 )\ng(e)\n\n(2.2)\n\nwith m0 usually the dominant mass and g(e) a known function of the eccentricity (about\n4 for large values). Even a typical hard binary with a \u2243 1 \u00d7 10\u22124 would only yield\ntGR \u2243 1000 for e = 0.999 and the present model parameters (c \u2243 15 000). Rather\nextreme dynamical evolution is therefore required to reach the relativistic regime.\n\n3. Multiple regularization schemes\nIn the following we summarize the main ideas involved in the three multiple regularization schemes outlined above. Although the TTL method (Mikkola & Aarseth 2002)\ndoes not deal specifically with the removal of singularities, it allows arbitrarily close encounters (including collisions) to be studied. Here the time transformation t\u2032 = 1/W is\ncombined with leapfrog integration of physical coordinates and velocities. The key feature\nis to replace an explicit evaluation of the auxiliary variable W = \u03a9(r) by the differential\nequation\n\u2202\u03a9\n,\n(3.1)\n\u1e86 = v *\n\u2202r\nwhich is usually a slowly varying quantity and integrated by W \u2032 = \u1e86 /\u03a9. The function\n\u03a9 may be taken as the sum of all inverse two-body distances when large mass ratios are\npresent. This leads to equations of motion for the relative coordinates and velocities, r, v\nof the form\nFi\nv\u2032\n,\n(3.2)\nr\u2032i = i , vi\u2032 =\nW\n\u03a9\nwith Fi the usual N -body acceleration.\nThe solutions are formulated as a set of leapfrog equations, with the quantity W\nintegrated over the time-step h by\nW1 = W0 + h\n\nv0 + v1 \u2202\u03a9(r 12 )\n.\n*\n2\u03a9(r 21 )\n\u2202r 12\n\n(3.3)\n\n\f3\n\nBlack holes\n\n1.1\n\nN = 240,000\n\n1\n\n0.9\n\ne\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\nTime\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\nFigure 1. Eccentricity evolution of a massive BH binary for N = 2.4 \u00d7 105 .\n\nThe addition of an external perturbation fi gives rise to the energy equation\nX\nfi\n(3.4)\nE\u2032 =\nmi vi *\n\u03a9\nwhich can be integrated in the same way as the other equations. As in the post-Newtonian\nformulation, velocity-dependent terms can be included by using the implicit mid-point\nmethod and solved by iteration.\nIn the case of one dominant body, it is natural to treat the system as a wheel-spoke\nwith all members connected to the central hub (Zare 1974). This representation can now\nbe seen as an alternative to the chain geometry. Hence the introduction of regularized\ncoordinates and momenta, Q and P, as well as their transformations can be taken over\ndirectly from chain regularization. After multiplying by the time transformation function\ng(q, p) the resulting Hamiltonian can be written as\n\u0393\u2217 = g(q, p) [H(Qi , Pi ) \u2212 E] .\n\n(3.5)\n\nHere the Hamiltonian function itself should be equal to the energy, E, along the solution\npath, with deviations due to numerical errors. The choice of time transformation as the\ninverse Lagrangian (in scaled physical units) has proved highly effective.\nIn contrast to standard two-body regularization where g = r and the singularities are\nremoved explicitly, the equations of motion derived from (3.5) must be differentiated\nterm by term without employing the simplifying condition \u0393\u2217 = 0. Again the effect of\nperturbers in changing the internal energy must be taken into account and added to any\npost-Newtonian contributions.\nThe third method, algorithmic regularization (Mikkola & Merritt 2006), makes use of\nthe implicit mid-point rule to achieve a time-symmetric leapfrog scheme. In this way,\nvelocity-dependent terms of the post-Newtonian expansion can be handled by the extrapolation method. This elegant algorithm produces exact solutions for unperturbed\n\n\f4\n\nSverre Aarseth\n\n1\n\nN = 240,000\n\n0.1\n0.01\n0.001\na\n1e-04\n1e-05\n1e-06\n1e-07\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\nTime\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\nFigure 2.

The new formulation employs two equivalent time transformations for coordinates and velocities,\nrespectively, given by\n1\n1\n, t\u2032v =\n,\n(3.6)\nt\u2032q =\n\u03b1T + B\n\u03b1U + \u03b2\u03a9 + \u03b3\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 are dimensionless constants and T, U and B are the kinetic, potential\nand positive binding energy. As above, \u03a9 can be taken to be the inverse sum of all\nseparations. Moreover, the slowly varying quantities \u03a9 and B are obtained by integration.\nThese time transformations are qualitatively similar to the inverse Lagrangian used in\nwheel-spoke regularization. We also note that the chain data structure is utilized in order\nto prevent loss of accuracy.\n\n4. N -body implementations\nEach method requires a suitable subsystem to be present which is ideally of a longlived nature. In the first instance, this usually occurs after the emergence of a hard binary\ncontaining one massive object near the centre. Other nearby members are then added to\nthe subsystem using standard selection criteria as for chain regularization. Conversely,\nany particles moving away from the BH system are included with the perturbers. These\nprocedures entail updating the internal energy consistently without explicit evaluation\nof the dominant terms. The membership change also requires initialization of force polynomials for the new centre of mass and any ejected particle. Since the simulations are\nmade on a GRAPE-6A (or GRAPE-6 initially), this procedure requires making differential force corrections on the host computer for interactions between subsystem members\n\n\f5\n\nBlack holes\n\nMODEL 9\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\ne\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\nTime\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nFigure 3. Eccentricity of the innermost binary, model M9.\n\nand perturbers. Finally, a check of total energy conservation is facilitated by separate\nintegration of the perturbations and relativistic contributions.\nThe special treatment for adapting the TTL method to a large-N simulation is analogous to that of chain regularization (Aarseth 2003a). The equations of motion are integrated to high accuracy and include the effect of perturbers selected in the usual way.\nConversely, the evaluation of the perturber forces take into account the structure of the\nsubsystem. In order to study a BH binary with massive components, we choose two\nidentical spherical systems in an elliptic orbit with eccentricity eorb = 0.8 and a massive\nobject at the centre of a cusp-like density distribution. In such a case of two merging\nclusters, the massive binary formed on a short time-scale (about 36 N -body units) and\nreached the hard binary stage (a = 4 \u00d7 10\u22124 ) at twice this time (see figure 2).\nThe algorithms for the wheel-spoke regularization have been described in considerable\ndetail elsewhere (Zare 1974, Aarseth 2003a, Aarseth 2007). Here we emphasize that\neach subsystem interaction with the massive reference body is treated as a standard KS\nregularization (Kustaanheimo & Stiefel 1965), while the other internal interactions are\nsubject to a small softening to smooth near-collisions of point-masses. Again the firstorder equations of motion are advanced by a high-order integrator (Bulirsch & Stoer\n1966). In view of the large mass ratio employed (around 300), only a few perturbers are\nusually selected for 3\u20134 members of the subsystem in this preliminary investigation.\nA sequential decision-making strategy has been implemented for including relativistic\neffects, initially up to 2.5PN (Aarseth 2003b). The main idea is to treat only the most\ndominant two-body motion. Moreover, the relevant terms are included progressively according to the value of tGR . For convenience we choose c = 3 \u00d7 105 /V \u2217 , where V \u2217 is the\nrms velocity in km s\u22121 . Hence for a specified total mass, relativistic effects can be examined via different values of the half-mass radius and the equilibrium velocity dispersion.\nIf the time-scale falls below a certain value (say tGR \u2243 1000) or the hyperbolic velocity\n\n\f6\n\nSverre Aarseth\n\n0.001\n\nMODEL 9\n\n0.0001\n\na\n\n1e-05\n\n1e-06\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\nTime\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nFigure 4.

The terms 1PN, 2PN, 3PN\nare then included for progressively shorter values chosen experimentally (say 100, 10, 1).\nThis procedure is based on the assumption that precession only plays an important role in\ndetuning the eccentricity growth in the later stages, which has been tested for some idealized cases of nearly isolated two-body motion. In order to reach the relativistic regime,\nit is necessary to achieve considerable shrinkage by dynamical evolution and/or a large\neccentricity. Unless stellar disruption occurs, gravitational coalescence is adopted if the\ndistance falls inside three Schwarzschild radii, 6m0 /c2 . Note that the two-body elements\na and e needed for decision-making are evaluated consistently with the corresponding\npost-Newtonian expansion (Mora & Will 2004) in order to avoid spurious effects.\nAn early N -body simulation of relativistic effects in compact systems (Lee 1993) examined binary formation by gravitational radiation capture using KS regularization. More\nrecently, this approach was extended up to 2.5PN for a similar study of collisional runaway (Kupi, Amaro\u2013Seoane & Spurzem 2006). A fully consistent scheme was employed,\nleading to a shorter merging time-scale for the central object.\n\n5. Some results\nThe special methods described above have been employed to study centrally concentrated systems containing one or more massive bodies. First we display the behaviour\nof a massive binary which formed as the result of two merging clusters, each with\nN0 = 1.2\u00d7105 equal-mass particles and a single body with mass ratio m0 /mi = (2N0 )1/2 .\nExperience shows that a square root relation for the mass is still sufficient for such\na binary to dominate the central region.

Eccentricity of the innermost binary, model M10.\n\nretical explanation for this behaviour. Likewise, a significant shrinkage of the semi-major\naxis took place. Most of this was due to dynamical evolution by sling-shot interactions\nuntil the final stage of rapid energy loss which led to gravitational coalescence.\nThe onset of the rather steep decrease in figure 2 is due to the slightly delayed experimental activation of the relativistic terms, which were included up to order 1/c5 (Aarseth\n2003b). However, the eccentricity increase to a large value (e = 0.996) by dynamical effects shown in figure 1 would also speed up the shrinkage. Although various refinements\nhave been added over the years, this early application of the TTL method demonstrated\nits usefulness in dealing with a difficult problem.\nSimulations with the wheel-spoke method have been made for point-mass systems\nas well as cluster models containing white dwarfs of mass 1 M\u2299 and radius r\u2217 = 5 \u00d7\n10\u22125 au. With only one BH present, the qualitative behaviour is now quite different. The\nevolution of a point-mass model is illustrated in figures 3 and 4. In this model, a rather\nsmall value of the half-mass radius was used (rh \u2243 0.1 pc or c \u2243 5000) and hence the\ncoalescence distance is larger than in similar models with rh \u2243 1 pc which also produced\n5\u20136 such events. A number of large amplitude excursions in eccentricity can be seen.\nThis behaviour is the hallmark of Kozai oscillations (Kozai 1962) which in many cases\nare induced by the second innermost stable orbit (Aarseth 2007).\nThe corresponding evolution of semi-major axis in figure 4 is characterized by several\nepisodes of orbital shrinkage, followed by coalescence. Each coalescence is controlled by\nthe minimum pericentre distance, a(1 \u2212 e), where the semi-major axis has a tendency to\ndecrease as a result of dynamical evolution (although reversed near the middle).\nSeveral white dwarf models were also investigated using similar initial conditions\n(Aarseth 2007). In such cases, disruption takes place when the pericentre distance falls\nbelow about 7r\u2217 . Even so, this is sufficiently small for significant energy loss by gravita-\n\n\f8\n\nSverre Aarseth\n\nMODEL M10\n\n0.001\n\n1e-04\n\na\n\n1e-05\n\n1e-06\n\n1e-07\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\nTime\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\nFigure 6.

Extensive tests with a single massive object\nconfirmed the qualitative results obtained by the wheel-spoke code. At the same time,\nthe decision-making for efficient usage was improved in response to various technical\nproblems. Very recently, a more general mass distribution was studied. In order to bypass\nthe generation of appropriate initial conditions, several simulations were started from\nt = 39 of a wheel-spoke model by inserting artificially two massive objects with eccentric\norbits in the inner region. The code is sufficiently robust to tolerate such a discontinuity\nand the evolution progressed normally.\nAs expected, the presence of two extra heavy objects leads to orbital decay towards the\ncentre by dynamical friction. In the first such attempt (model M 10), the extra masses\nwere quite modest (4 \u00d7 10\u22124 and 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 ) with a favourable value for the rms velocity,\nV \u2217 \u2243 300 km s\u22121 (or c = 1000 in N -body units). Consequently the early evolution in\nfigures 5 and 6 was qualitatively similar to some previous models, with six coalescence\nevents due to the Kozai mechanism. At a later stage, all three heavy objects formed a\ncompact subsystem, after which the lightest was ejected but not with sufficient energy\nto escape. There followed a long period with the dominant binary shrinking slowly by\nGR energy loss until coalescence. The third BH also returned to the centre before this\nevent and underwent coalescence some 10 time units later. Consequently, the later stage\nwas again dominated by a single massive body and three more mergers took place.\nWe also report on two models (M 11 and M 12) with more realistic parameters. Two\nadditional BHs were added with masses 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 and 1 \u00d7 10\u22123 in a less dense system\nwith V \u2217 \u2243 20 km s\u22121. Consequently, c = 15 000 was adopted.

Eccentricity of the innermost binary, model M12.\n\nabove, the second and third BHs already formed part of the compact subsystem at t \u2243 44\nand t \u2243 48, respectively. The latter was ejected but returned for an energetic sling-shot\ninteraction (Saslaw, Valtonen & Aarseth 1974) leading to escape from the cluster. The\nsubsequent semi-major axis declined to aBH \u2243 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 at t = 112 when the calculation\nwas halted, with the GR time-scale still quite large (e \u2243 0.66). It is noteworthy that the\nfinal binding energy exceeded 33 % of the total energy, all due to dynamical effects.\nModel M 12 exhibited another type of behaviour, illustrated in figures 7 and 8. The\nearly stage (t < 46) gave rise to Kozai oscillations up to e = 0.9999 involving the primary\nBH but only sufficient to touch the relativistic regime. The second BH formed a binary\nwith the first soon after (t \u2243 50), whereupon the innermost binary became wider. In\nview of the considerably smaller rms velocity, relativistic effects only played a minor\nrole. However, near t = 68, the eccentricity of the dominant binary (M = 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 )\ndid reach emax = 0.99998, induced by the third BH with small eccentricity and large\ninclination, which resulted in GR coalescence. This model therefore ended up with a\nlow-eccentricity BH binary, decreasing slowly in size by dynamical means only.\n\n6. The future\nIn this contribution, we have demonstrated the practical usefulness of three special\nregularization methods for treating one or more black holes in a dense stellar system.\nMoreover, each method is capable of dealing with considerable dynamical shrinkage and\nthe calculation can be extended to the relativistic regime if necessary. Such problems\noffer a rich complexity of outcomes for future studies. In particular, it will be desirable to\nextend the simulations to larger systems. Based on present experience, a careful treatment\nis needed to deal with short time-scales which are a feature of compact subsystems.\nObservational imprints of such interactions will undoubtedly reveal new secrets.\n\n\f10\n\nSverre Aarseth\n\n0.001\n\nMODEL 12\n\n1e-04\n\na\n\n1e-05\n\n1e-06\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\nTime\n\n65\n\n70\n\n75\n\n80\n\n85\n\nFigure 8.
