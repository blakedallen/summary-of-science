It is thus natural to ask if this duality can be tested and utilized\nin the cases of gauge theories in dimensions other than four. Such investigations are\nnaturally motivated by the need to understand how the gauge/gravity duality may be\nrealized in non-conformal supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. For the special cases\nof sixteen supercharge SYM theories in diverse dimensions, the gravity duals were\nproposed some time ago in [1]. While the feasibility of generic tests of gauge/gravity\nduality is not very clear for sixteen supercharge SYM theories in dimensions greater\nthan four: the SYM theories are not renormalizable and the dual Dp-brane geometries\nsuffer from the non-decoupling of the alpha-prime corrections, it is worthwhile to exploit the duality between SYM theories in p + 1 dimensions and Dp-branes and test it\nin the case of protected operators whose vacuum expectation values are independent\nof the coupling g 2. A special class of Wilson loops, first proposed by Zarembo in the\ncase of N = 4 SYM [2] are particularly well suited to this purpose. In this paper we\ngeneralize Zarembo's construction to perform a non-trivial test of the duality between\nDp-brane theories and SYM in p + 1 dimensions.\nThe Maldacena-Wilson loop [3, 4] has proven to be a very powerful probe of the\nAdS/CFT correspondence. In four dimensional N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills\ntheory it is given by\nI\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\nW =\nTr P exp d\u03c4 i\u1e8b\u03bc (\u03c4 )A\u03bc + |\u1e8b(\u03c4 )|\u0398I (\u03c4 )\u03a6I ,\n(1)\nN\nwhere N is the rank of the gauge group SU(N), \u03a6I are the six scalar fields of the\ntheory, and \u0398I \u0398I = 1. The path of the Wilson loop is defined by x\u03bc (\u03c4 ), but there is\nalso the freedom to define a path on S 5 parametrized by \u0398I (\u03c4 ). The specific coupling\nto the scalar fields in (1) is chosen to ensure local supersymmetry; the amount of\nglobal supersymmetry respected by W is intimately connected with the correlation\nof the paths x\u03bc (\u03c4 ) and \u0398I (\u03c4 ). There is a \"perfectly\" correlated choice, found by\nZarembo [2]1\n\u1e8b\u03bc I\nM , M\u03bcI M\u03bdI = \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd ,\n(2)\n\u0398I (\u03c4 ) =\n|\u1e8b| \u03bc\n\nwhere M\u03bcI is a constant matrix, which assures that the vacuum expectation value of\nthe Wilson loop is trivial\nhW iZarembo = 1.\n(3)\nThe amount of supersymmetry respected by the loop is found by requiring\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03b4\u01eb W \u223c \u1e8b\u03bc i\u03b3\u03bc + M\u03bcI \u0393I \u01eb = 0.\n1\n\n(4)\n\nThese Wilson loops are closely related to a class constructed later in [5, 6, 7] whose contours lie\non a three-sphere.\n\n1\n\n\fThis gives one halving of the supersymmetry2 for each non-zero component of \u1e8b\u03bc , so\nthat, for example, a planar loop is 1/4 BPS. One can appreciate the result (3) from a\nfew different perspectives. The first is that (2) ensures that the combined gauge and\nscalar field Feynman gauge propagator joining two points on the loop is zero\nD\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011E\ni\u1e8b\u03bc (\u03c4 )A\u03bc + |\u1e8b(\u03c4 )|\u0398Ix (\u03c4 )\u03a6I i\u1e8f \u03bd (\u03c3)A\u03bd + |\u1e8f(\u03c3)|\u0398Jy (\u03c3)\u03a6J\n(5)\ng 2 \u2212\u1e8b * \u1e8f + \u0398x * \u0398y |\u1e8b||\u1e8f|\n= 2\n= 0,\n4\u03c0\n(x \u2212 y)2\nwhich immediately precludes the contribution of ladder/rainbow diagrams. As shown\nby Zarembo [2], all interacting diagrams up to two loops can also, without an inordinate effort, be shown to vanish. A much stronger statement was made in [8], where\nsuperspace techniques were exploited to prove (3) for Wilson loops whose contours\nare contained in R3 . The loops of Zarembo are also naturally described in terms\nof the twisting of N = 4 SYM to produce a topological theory; in this context the\ntriviality of the vacuum expectation value for loops in the full R4 was proven in [9].\nAt strong coupling the vacuum expectation value of (1) is accessible via the dual\nstring theory. It is given by the partition function of a fundamental string, the saddle\npoints of which are minimal area embeddings in AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 [3, 10]. In the following\ncoordinates for AdS5 \u00d7 S 5\nds2 = U 2 dX \u03bc dX \u03bc +\n\n1\ndU I dU I ,\n2\nU\n\n(6)\n\none requires the following boundary conditions for the string embedding \u03a3 at the\nboundary U = \u221e\nUI\nX \u03bc |\u2202\u03a3 = x\u03bc ,\n= \u0398I .\n(7)\n|U| \u2202\u03a3\n\nThe action of the string is then found to contain a generic divergence owing to the\ndiverging area element of Anti-de Sitter space as the boundary is approached. This\ndivergence is proportional to the circumference of the loop\n\u221a Z\n\u221a \u0012\n\u0013\nI\np\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n2\nd \u03c3 det \u2202a XM \u2202b XN GM N =\nUmax. d\u03c4 |\u1e8b(\u03c4 )| + Areg. , (8)\nS=\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\nwhere XM = (X \u03bc , U I ), and may be \u221a\nremoved via a Legendre transformation [10],\nleaving the regularized action Sreg. = \u03bbAreg. /(2\u03c0). The result for the vacuum expectation value of (1) is then\nhW i\u03bb\u2192\u221e = V exp (\u2212Sreg. ) ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere V is a prefactor stemming from integration over zero modes in the partition\nfunction. The disc partition function naturally involves three zero modes. If there\nis no extra parametric freedom in embedding the string, then V \u223c \u03bb\u22123/4 , i.e. one\n2\n\nThe Poincar\u00e9 and superconformal supersymmetries are halved independently of one another.\n\n2\n\n\ffactor of \u03bb\u22121/4 for each zero mode. This is the case for the standard 1/2 BPS circle\nwhich sits at a point on S 5 [11]. The expectation therefore, for the string dual of the\nZarembo loops, is that V = 1, and Sreg. = 0. The first of these conditions has not been\nshown explicitly, and for other than planar loops remains a mystery. For the case of\nplanar loops, it was argued in [2] that there are 3 compensating zero modes stemming\nfrom parametric freedom in embedding the string in an S 2 \u2282 S 5 . For loops other\nthan planar, it remains unclear how the contribution of the three basic zero modes\nis cancelled [12]. We discuss this issue further in section 3.3. The second condition,\nSreg. = 0, was shown explicitly by Zarembo in [2] for the circular supersymmetric\nWilson loop in AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 . There the string solution was found and the regularized\naction calculated. The analogous string-side embodiment of the results of [8] were\nrealized3 in [12], where it was proven that Sreg. = 0 for the string dual of a generic\nN = 4 SYM Zarembo Wilson loop. This used the method of calibrated surfaces\nwhich we will review in section 3.2.\nIn the present work we will extend these results, to the degree it is possible,\nto maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories in general spacetime dimensions.\nIndeed we may view (1) as arising from a toroidal compactification of the standard\nWilson loop in N = 1, d = 10 SYM, and in this sense we are free to compactify more\nor less directions than 6, namely 9 \u2212 p where p ranges from 0 to 9,\nI\n1\nTr P exp d\u03c4 i\u1e8bM (\u03c4 )AM\nN\nI\n(10)\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\n\u03bc\nI\nI\n\u2192\nTr P exp d\u03c4 i\u1e8b (\u03c4 )A\u03bc + |\u1e8b(\u03c4 )|\u0398 (\u03c4 )\u03a6 ,\nN\nwhere M = 1, . . . , 10, \u03bc = 1, . . . , p + 1, I = 1, . . . , 9 \u2212 p. We then require the same\nrelations to hold relating the paths x\u03bc and \u0398I , i.e. (2). The supersymmetry relation\n(4) also continues to hold after this dimensional reduction. For the various spacetime\ndimensions d, we are restricted by (2) to curves x\u03bc (\u03c4 ) in various subspaces of Rd ,\nthese are summarized in the table below.\nd\nCurves in\n\n1\nR1\n\n2\nR2\n\n3\nR3\n\n4\nR4\n\n5\nR5\n\n6\nR4\n\n7\nR3\n\n8\nR2\n\n9\nR1\n\nWe will concentrate on the dimensions 2 \u2264 d \u2264 8, since the curves in R1 are the\ntrivial 1/2 BPS straight lines.\nOn the gauge theory side, we perform our analyses using both perturbative and\n(non-perturbative) superspace techniques. From the perturbative point of view, we\nstudy the relevant gauge theories in a unified way, up to the next to leading order\n(NLO), or two loop approximation. This analysis allows us to perform a straightforward extension of the results presented in [2]. At this order in perturbation theory\nwe find that the vacuum expectation value for the Zarembo loops in all dimensional\nreductions of the d = 10, N = 1 SYM theories, down to d = 1, is identically '1'.\nClearly, the NLO results beg the question if some or all of the gauge theories preserve\nthe triviality of the Zarembo loops to higher or even all orders in perturbation theory.\n3\n\nThe issue of the zero mode prefactor V is still outstanding.\n\n3\n\n\fOn a related note, one may also worry about the reasonability of perturbative\nmethods in non-renormalizable gauge theories, which SYM in d \u2265 5 are expected to\nbe. Though we do not expect the perturbative results for generic gauge theory observables in these theories to be meaningful, we can use perturbation theory to gauge\nthe validity of results believed to be protected by non-renormalization theorems. The\nnon-renormalization theorems for the sixteen supercharge theories in question were\nderived in [8]. In that paper, the d dimensional SYM theories were reformulated in\na d \u2212 3 superspace language. This reformulation, which is briefly reviewed in the\nnext section, allows one to view the Wilson loops in question as elements of a chiral\nring. Furthermore, the (superspace) equations of motion were shown to imply shape\ninvariance of the loops embeddable in R3 . These two results were used to formally\nestablish the triviality of these Zarembo loops for all sixteen supercharge gauge theories in 7 > d \u2265 3. The appearance of a generalized Konishi anomaly in d = 7 [8] puts\nan upper bound (in terms of dimensions) on the gauge theories for which the perturbative results may be expected to hold to all loop orders. However, for gauge theories\nin d < 3, the superspace methods are simply limited by the construction/requirement\nof a d \u2212 3 dimensional superspace, with at least one dynamical supercoordinate. We\ncan thus regard the perturbative results as a non-trivial verification of the predictions\nof [8] at the NLO, and a hint toward the potential for generalization of the triviality\nof the Zarembo loops to all loop orders for gauge theories in dimensions 3 > d \u2265 1.\nOn the gravity side, we use the string duals for the sixteen supercharge Yang-Mills\ntheories proposed in [1]. These Dp-brane geometries (where d = p + 1) contain an\nS 8\u2212p , the d boundary theory coordinates, and a U direction, so that the boundary\nis at U = \u221e. We find the explicit fundamental string solutions corresponding to\ncircular Zarembo-type Wilson loops in these backgrounds4 . They wrap part of an\nS 2 \u2282 S 8\u2212p and extend in the U-direction from the boundary circle. We find that\nthese solutions have the expected zero regularized area. This result is independent\nof the cut-off Umax. where the boundary theory is defined; this is the string-side\nmanifestation of the protection of these operators in the gauge theories, despite the\nissues of running couplings and non-renormalizability. In appendix A we analyze the\nsupersymmetry respected by the solutions and find that they are indeed 1/4 BPS,\nas required. We also generalize the framework of calibrated surfaces given in [12] to\nthe Dp-brane geometries, thereby proving that the regularized action vanishes for any\nZarembo-type Wilson loop constructed in these theories, and as a check show that\nour circular string solutions also satisfy the appropriate equations. Finally, in section\n3.3 we discuss the potential string-side manifestation of the gauge theory generalized\nKonishi anomaly for d = 7.\n\n2\n\nGauge theory results\n\nIn this section we present the arguments in favor of the triviality of the vacuum\nexpectation values of supersymmetric Wilson loops in 16 supercharge super Yang4\n\nString duals of generic Wilson loops have also been considered in the Dp-brane geometries, see\n[13].\n\n4\n\n\fMills theories, from the perspective of the relevant gauge theories. To this end, we\nshall start with a perturbative point of view, and subsequently correlate the weakcoupling results with all-loop predictions based on superspace techniques obtained in\n[8].\nWe start with a sixteen supercharge SYM action in 10 > 2\u03c9 \u2265 1 dimensions given\nby\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n1\n1 2\n1 i j2\n2\u03c9\ni 2\n\u03bc\ni\ni\nS = 2 d x Tr\nF + (D\u03bc \u03a6 ) \u2212 [\u03a6 , \u03a6 ] + \u03a8\u0304\u0393 D\u03bc \u03a8 + i\u03a8\u0304\u0393 [\u03a6 , \u03a8] . (11)\ng\n2 \u03bc\u03bd\n2\nIt is understood that the Lorentz indices \u03bc, \u03bd = 1, . . . , 2\u03c9 while the number of scalars\ni, j = 1, . . . , (10 \u2212 2\u03c9).\nAs was shown by Zarembo in [2], the triviality of the Wilson loop expectation value\nat the leading order in perturbation theory is simply a consequence of the equality of\nthe gluon and scalar propagators in the Feynman gauge. Although the focus in [2]\nwas on four dimensional gauge theory, this leading order result readily generalizes to\nall the dimensional reductions of the ten dimensional N = 1 gauge theory.\nAt the next-to-leading order, the diagrams that do not involve loop corrections to\npropagators cancel due to the same reason as above. In other words, the following\ncancelations between Feynman diagrams occur for all dimensional reductions of N =\n1, d = 10 SYM theories, due to the same arguments put forward in the Feynman\ngauge for the four dimensional theory in [2]:\n\n+\n\n= 0,\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n= 0.\n\n= 0,\n\nFor the triviality of the Wilson loop expectation value to hold at the next-to-leading\norder, all that one needs to show is the equality between the one loop corrected gluon\nand scalar propagators in the Feynman gauge, such that the following cancelation\ntakes place:\n\n+\n\n= 0.\n\n5\n\n\fThe one-loop gluon propagator in this gauge is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0393(2 \u2212 \u03c9)\u0393(\u03c9)\u0393(\u03c9 \u2212 1)\n\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 p\u03bc p\u03bd /p2\n2\nab\n2 ab 1\nfg (\u03c9)\n,\n\u2206\u03bc\u03bd = g \u03b4 2 \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 g N\np\n(4\u03c0)\u03c9 \u0393(2\u03c9)\np4\u22122\u03c9\n\n(12)\n\nwhere the function fg encodes the contributions to the propagator from the various\ninteraction vertices\nfg = 2(3\u03c9 \u2212 1) \u2212 Ns \u2212 Nf (\u03c9 \u2212 1).\n(13)\n\nThe contribution of 2(3\u03c9 \u2212 1) in fg is due to the combination of the gluon-gluon and\nghost-gluon scattering in 2\u03c9 dimensions. The factor of Ns arises from the Ns real\nadjoint scalars running in loops, while the factor of Nf ; the number of real fermionic\ndegrees of freedom in the theory, is due to gluon-fermion scattering.\nUsing the same notation, we may write the one loop corrected scalar propagator\nas\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0393(2 \u2212 \u03c9)\u0393(\u03c9)\u0393(\u03c9 \u2212 1)\n\u03b4mn\nab\n2 ab 1\n2\n\u2206mn = g \u03b4 2 \u03b4mn \u2212 g N\n(14)\nfs (\u03c9) 4\u22122\u03c9 ,\np\n(4\u03c0)\u03c9 \u0393(2\u03c9)\np\nwhere\n\nNf\n(2\u03c9 \u2212 1).\n(15)\n2\nThe contribution of 4(2\u03c9 \u2212 1) comes about due to the scalar-vector intermediate\nstate, while the fermion loop contribution to the scalar propagator generates a factor\nN\nof 2f (2\u03c9 \u2212 1) with the opposite sign.\nfs (\u03c9) = 4(2\u03c9 \u2212 1) \u2212\n\nA necessary and sufficient condition for the supersymmetric Wilson loops to have\nunit vacuum expectation value at the one and two loop level is\nfg = fs .\n\n(16)\n\nIt is easy to check that this is indeed satisfied when the number of real scalars Ns =\n10 \u2212 2\u03c9 and Nf = 16.\nWe have thus established the triviality of the Wilson loop expectation value at\nthe next to leading order for all dimensional reductions of the N = 1 ten dimensional\nSYM.\nThe one loop corrected gluon and scalar propagators, as they have been expressed\nabove, are also valid for the dimensional reduction of the six and four dimensional\nN = 1 SYM theories as well. The equality of the loop corrected propagators continues\nto hold if we use either\nNf = 8, Ns = 6 \u2212 2\u03c9 or\nNf = 4, Ns = 4 \u2212 2\u03c9.\n\n(17)\n(18)\n\nThis fact proves the triviality of Wilson loop expectation value for eight (four) supercharge theories in dimensions less than or equal to five (three).\nThus, the following table summarizes the balance between the number of dimensions and the number of supersymmetries necessary for Wilson loops to have trivial\nexpectation values at the next-to-leading order:\n6\n\n\fNumber of Supercharges\n16\n8\n4\n\nDimensions \u2264\n9\n5\n3\n\nIt is probably too optimistic to expect that all the gauge theories listed above retain\nthe triviality of the Zarembo loops to all orders in perturbation theory. However, for\nthe case of the sixteen supercharge theories, lower dimensional superspace techniques\nwere successfully employed in [8] to probe the all-loop behavior of many of the gauge\ntheories considered above. We shall briefly review these techniques and compare the\nsuperspace results with the perturbative computations reported above.\nFor the four dimensional theory, the starting point was a rewriting of the action\nin a N = 2, d = 1 superspace, coordinatized by t, \u03b8\u03b1 , \u03b8\u0304\u03b1 , where \u03b1 = 1, 2 is an SU(2)\nindex. The action for the four dimensional gauge theory was shown to be [8]5\n\" \u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n1\n2i\n3\n\u03b1\nS = 2 d x dt Tr W\u03b1 W \u01ebijk (\u03a6i \u2202j \u03a6k + \u03a6i \u03a6j \u03a6k ) + cc\ng\n3\n\u03b8\u03b8\n#\n(19)\n\u0001\nV\n\u2212V\n.\n+ Tr \u03a9\u0304i e \u03a9i e\n\u03b8\u03b8 \u03b8\u0304 \u03b8\u0304\nIn the quantum mechanical superspace, the three chiral superfields \u03a6i contain the\nspatial components of the gauge potential Ai and three of the six real scalars6 \u03a6i+3 .\nThe bottom component of the chiral fields being given by Ai + i\u03a6i+3 . The temporal\ncomponent A0 as well as \u03a67,8,9 are contained in the vector superfield V . The superfields are also implicitly labeled by the coordinates xi , which are treated simply as\nauxiliary indices from the quantum mechanical point of view. \u03a9 is given by\n\u03a9i = \u03a6i + e\u2212V (i\u2202i \u2212 \u03a6\u0304i )eV .\n\n(20)\n\nOne of the main observations in the paper was that the Wilson loops of the type\nconsidered in this paper could be thought of as elements of a chiral ring from the\nlower dimensional superspace point of view. In particular the equation of motion for\nthese loops took on the form\nD \u0010\n\u0011E\nTr W (C, x) \u01ebijk Fjk (x)\n= Ai ,\n(21)\n\u03b8=\u03b8\u0304=0\n\nwhere,\n\nFjk = \u2202j \u03a6k \u2212 \u2202k \u03a6j + i[\u03a6j , \u03a6k ],\n\n(22)\n\nand where W (C, x) is the untraced Wilson loop operator with a marked point x on\nthe loop, and Ai is a possible anomaly term. In the absence of the anomaly term, the\nloop equation implied shape independence. In conjunction with the fact that the loop\n5\n\nW\u03b1 = D\u0304 D\u0304eV D\u03b1 e\u2212V , see [8] for further details.\nAt the risk of abuse of notation, we denote both the chiral superspace fields as well as the real\nscalars by \u03a6. We hope that the difference will be clear from the context.\n6\n\n7\n\n\fis an element of the chiral ring, the shape independence yielded a trivial expectation\nvalue of the loop. Note that this hinges upon the three-dimensional epsilon symbol\nand for this reason is limited to curves in R3 .\nSimilar arguments were also applied to sixteen supercharge Yang-Mills theories\nin dimensions 3 \u2264 d \u2264 7. The key to the generalization was being able to write\nthe action for the relevant gauge theories in a four supercharge d \u2212 3 dimensional\nsuperspace. It was further shown that only in the case of the seven dimensional\ngauge theory does one encounter a non-zero anomaly; this is the generalized Konishi\nanomaly.\nConjoining these superspace arguments with the evidence presented from the weak\ncoupling perturbation theory, we conclude that sixteen supercharge SYM theories in\ndimensions 6 \u2265 d \u2265 3 possess supersymmetric Wilson loops with trivial vacuum\nexpectation values.\nIt is also worth noting that lower dimensional superspace methods were also employed to analyze Wilson loops in SYM theories with 8 supercharges, and Wilson\nloops with trivial expectation values were found in 4 \u2265 d \u2265 1 dimensions in [14].\nThese results are consistent with the perturbative results reported earlier for the\ndimensional reductions of N = 1, d = 6 SYM. The case of the five dimensional\nYang-Mills theory, suffers from a non-vanishing anomaly, which was not seen in the\nperturbative calculations we presented above.\nIn summary, the next to leading order perturbation theory and the superspace\narguments match up in the following cases:\nNumber of Supersymmetries\n16\n8\n\nDimensions\n3\u2264d\u22646\n1\u2264d\u22644\n\nIn the case of sixteen supercharge theories, we also have a dual gravity description\navailable to us. In what follows, we reproduce and generalize the results for this case\nusing the dual gravity picture. As the table above indicates, apart from the usefulness\nof the gravity computation as non-trivial test of the gauge gravity duality, can hope\nto shed some light on the non-perturbative behavior of the Zarembo loops for the\ngauge theories for which the lower dimensional superspace arguments do not exist,\ne.g. the case of d = 2 SYM with sixteen supercharges.\n\n3\n\nString duals and strong coupling results\n\nThe string duals of the class of maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories were\npresented in [1]. The holographic dual of the d = p + 1 dimensional gauge theory is\ngiven by the string frame metric\n\u0013\n\u0012 (7\u2212p)/2\nCp\nU\n2\n2\n(p\u22123)/2\n2\n2\n\u2032\ndxq + (7\u2212p)/2 dU + Cp U\nd\u03a98\u2212p ,\nds = \u03b1\nCp\nU\n(23)\n\u0012 2 \u0013(3\u2212p)/4\n\u0013\n\u0012\nC\n7\n\u2212\np\np\n,\ne\u03c6 = (2\u03c0)2\u2212p g 2\n, Cp2 = g 2 N 27\u22122p \u03c0 (9\u22123p)/2 \u0393\nU 7\u2212p\n2\n8\n\n\fwhere g and N are the bare coupling and the number of colours of the dual YangMills theory. There is also a p-form gauge potential which depends only on the U\ncoordinate. These solutions are obtained from the field theory limit of Dp-brane\nsolutions\n(p\u22123)/2\ng 2 = (2\u03c0)p\u22122 gs \u03b1\u2032\n= fixed, \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0,\n(24)\nwhere one can see that for p > 3, the string coupling gs \u2192 \u221e which indicates a\nbreakdown of the limit, in the sense that \u03b1\u2032 corrections are not suppressed and the\ndecoupling of bulk modes is not guaranteed. This is a reflection of the fact that\nthe Yang-Mills theories with d = p + 1 > 4 are nonrenormalizable. As discussed in\nthe introduction, we are describing objects which are protected and therefore we can\ntrust our solutions in spite of this breakdown. Indeed we will find that the regularized\naction of our string solutions vanishes independently of the choice of cut-off Umax. the coordinate dual to the boundary gauge theory energy scale.\n\n3.1\n\nSupersymmetric circular loops\n\nWe present here string solutions corresponding to circular supersymmetric Wilson\nloops in the background (23). We have a natural lower bound of p = 1, in order that\nthe boundary has enough dimensions to accommodate the circle, namely two, and a\nnatural upper bound of p = 7, since, as we will see below, we will require at least an\nS 1 to accommodate the coupling of the Wilson loop to the scalars of the dual gauge\ntheory. We have analyzed the supersymmetry of these solutions in appendix A, where\nwe show that they are 1/4 BPS.\nWe begin with the action of the fundamental string in Euclidean conformal gauge,\nin the background (23). With the cases p < 7 in mind, we write\ndx2q = dr 2 + r 2 d\u03c8 2 + dx2p\u22121 ,\nd\u03a98\u2212p = d\u03b82 + cos2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03a926\u2212p ,\n\n(25)\n\nwhere dx2p\u22121 is a p \u2212 1 dimensional metric on R1,p\u22122 or Rp\u22121 (in the case p = 1 we are\nforced to take the Euclidean metric). Our solution ansatz is then\n\u03c8 = \u03c6 = \u03c4, \u03c4 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0], r = r(U), \u03b8 = \u03b8(U), dx2p\u22121 = d\u03a926\u2212p = 0,\n\n(26)\n\nwith which we can write the string action as\n\"\n#\nZ\nZ\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u20322\nCp 2\u03c0\nU\nU (7\u2212p)/2 \u0010 2\n2\n2\nS=\nr + r \u2032 + (7\u2212p)/2 + U (p\u22123)/2 \u03b8\u2032 + cos2 \u03b8 , (27)\nd\u03c4 d\u03c3\n4\u03c0 0\nCp2\nU\nwhere prime denotes differentiation w.r.t. \u03c3.

Note that for p > 4,\nr(\u221e) = \u221e, R becomes imaginary, and so the solution doesn't satisfy the usual\nboundary condition. We will cut the geometry off at Umax. however, and so define the\nradius of the circle in the boundary theory as r(Umax. ).\nThe case p = 7 is special, as \u03b8 = \u03b8\u2032 = 0 for this case; the string wraps only the\nS 1 defined by the angle \u03c6. In order to simplify the presentation we give the explicit\nsolution in terms of \u03c3 here, and then continue with the cases 1 < p < 7 below. The\nsolution for p = 7 is\nU = Umin. cosh \u03c3,\n\nr = C7 Umin. sinh \u03c3,\n\n\u03c3 \u2208 [0, \u03c3max. ],\n\n(30)\n\n2\nand leads to the action S = C7 Umin.\ncosh \u03c3max. sinh \u03c3max. , which upon regularization\nas in (35) below, yields zero.\nContinuing with cases 1 < p < 7, the solution (29) wraps one half of an S 2 \u2282 S 8\u2212p ;\nthe string worldsheet's boundary lies along the equator7 . In order to check that (29)\nis in fact a solution to the equations of motion we express r \u2032 and \u03b8\u2032 in terms of U \u2032\nand plug them into the Virasoro constraint (28) and solve for U \u2032 in terms of U. The\nresult of this operation is\n(q\n\u0001\n2\n5\u2212p /U 5\u2212p \u2212 1 (U 2 \u2212 U 2 ),\nU\np 6= 5\nmin.\nmin.\n\u2032\nU = p 5\u2212p\n(31)\n2\n2 log(U/Umin. ) (U 2 \u2212 Umin. ),\np = 5.\n\nWith this expression we can also express U \u2032\u2032 in terms of U, and through (29), we can\ntherefore also express r \u2032\u2032 and \u03b8\u2032\u2032 in terms of U.

Using (28) we can express the\naction as twice the \"prime\" terms, i.e. those involving derivatives by \u03c3. We express\neverything in terms of U and U \u2032 , the latter we use to reexpress the integration over\n7\n\nMore precisely, when Umax. is not strictly \u221e, the boundary is shifted down towards the pole.\n\n10\n\n\fFigure 1: A plot of U vs. r for the solutions (29).

We now show that this machinery\napplies equally well to the case of general p. As a check on our work, we also show\nthat it applies to the solutions (29).\nIn order to apply the technique we express the metric of S 8\u2212p together with the\ndU 2 term from (23) as follows\ndY I dY I\ndU 2\n2\n+\nd\u03a9\n=\n,\n8\u2212p\nU2\nY2\n\nY I = U \u03b8\u0302I ,\n\n\u03b8\u0302I \u03b8\u0302I = 1,\n\nI = 1, . . . , 9 \u2212 p.\n\nFor convenience we will rescale the x\u03bcq = Cp X \u03bc .

It is clear that this can\n \u0304\nonly be done for p \u2264 4. For p > 4 we can choose instead to split the X \u03bc = (X I , V i ), so\n \u0304\nthat X I has the same number of components as Y I , and what follows is equally true\n(with the appropriate relabelling of indices).

We then have that\nZ\nCp\nS=\nJ,\n(46)\n2\u03c0 \u03a3\nthat is, we have that the action of the string worldsheet is expressible as an integral\nof the closed 2-form J over the string worldsheet.

This is precisely the contour of\nthe supersymmetric Wilson loop in the gauge theory (2), (7). Thus we have found a\nsolution to the string equations of motion which also satisfies the necessary boundary\nconditions.

In fact, as discussed in the introduction,\nthere is more to the vacuum expectation value of the Wilson loop than the regularized\naction; the prefactor V stemming from integration over zero modes in the partition\nfunction also plays a role. The issue, as regards supersymmetric Wilson loops, was\nfirst discussed in [2], for the case p = 3. Although there appears to be no parametric freedom for the minimal area embedding of a string in an AdS space with given\nboundary conditions, Zarembo argued that the supersymmetric circle may be embedded into the S 5 with a freedom given by a vector n \u2208 S 3 which chooses which S 2 the\n8\n\nThe p = 5, 7 cases follow similarly.\n\n14\n\n\fworldsheet occupies. This gives a natural reason for the cancellation of the prefactor\nin hW i, as these three zero modes could cancel the effect of the basic three coming\nfrom the AdS embedding. This reasoning is limited to the case of planar curves, and\n[12] noted the lack of resolution of this problem for general curves. Specifically, in\norder for the R-symmetry of the Wilson loop defined in the gauge theory to match\nthe string solution, these zero modes must be integrated over.\nIn our case we note the fact that uniquely in the case of d = 7 (i.e. p = 6) do we\nhave that the spherical product space S 8\u2212p is an S 2 . In this case we are restricted to\ncurves in R3 , and we will concentrate on our explicit solution for the supersymmetric\ncircle, although we expect the following comments to be true for general closed curves\nin R3 . The fact that the spherical product space is an S 2 precludes the existence of\nzero modes on the spherical side of the geometry, and thus, assuming the absence\nof any parametric freedom in the embedding on the analogue of the AdS side of\nthe geometry, precludes the possible cancellation of the three basic zero modes of the\nstring worldsheet. We would thus expect a non-zero prefactor V \u223c \u03bb\u22123/4 and therefore\nour prediction for the vacuum expectation value of the Wilson loop at strong coupling\nis\n\u0012 \u0013\u22123/4\n\u03bb\nhW id=7 \u223c\n,\n(56)\nR3\nwhere R is a scale setting the size of the Wilson loop. This seems to be the string-side\nmanifestation of the generalized Konishi anomaly in d = 7 discussed in section 2. It\nwould be very interesting to try to recover this result from gauge theory.\nWe also note that for d = 8, we have Wilson loops in R2 described by a string\nworldsheet wrapping a spherical product space which is simply an S 1 . Here too we do\nnot expect parametric freedom in the string embedding, and so again would expect\nthe basic three zero modes to give hW i =\n6 1, as in (56) above. It would, of course, be\nof great interest to uncover a gauge theoretic mechanism for this potential anomaly\nin d = 8.\nThe situation is extremely reminiscent of the circular Wilson loop for N = d = 4\nSYM obtained by a \"large\" conformal transformation of the straight line. In that case,\nthe Wilson loop expectation value is a non-trivial function of the 't Hooft coupling.\nHowever, the vacuum expectation value for the loop is entirely determined by an\nanomaly; namely, the conformal anomaly [11]. For the seven dimensional gauge\ntheory, the generalized Konishi anomaly seems to play a similar role. It is tempting\nto speculate that it might similarly be possible to recover the strong coupling result\nmentioned above from the gauge theory end, by reducing the problem to a matrix\nmodel computation9 .\n\n4\n\nSummary and outlook\n\nIn this paper we have generalized the construction of supersymmetric Wilson loops\nin N = 4, d = 4 SYM at weak and strong coupling to the general case of SYM\n9\n\nTo this end, it might be interesting to investigate if the methods of [15] can be adapted to the\nanalysis of the gauge theory in d = 7.\n\n15\n\n\ftheories with 16 supercharges in d dimensions (and in the case of d \u2264 4 (d \u2264 3)\nat weak coupling, with 8 (4) supercharges). We have given two-loop perturbative\nevidence and reviewed the applicability of evidence from superspace techniques, that\nthese loops have trivial vacuum expectation values. Using the gauge/strings duality\nwe have also described the 16 supercharge theory supersymmetric Wilson loops at\nstrong coupling and also found strong evidence of trivial expectation values; the dual\nstring solutions have zero regularized action. We have found the explicit fundamental\nstring solutions for the case of circular supersymmetric loops in general d. In the\ncase of d = 7 where superspace techniques indicate a non-zero expectation value on\nthe gauge theory side, we have found a strong candidate dual manifestation of this\nphenomena at strong coupling, namely the disappearance of string worldsheet zero\nmodes. Based on this we have given a prediction for the strong coupling behavior of\nthe vacuum expectation value of supersymmetric Wilson loops in the d = 7 theory.\nLooking beyond the issues addressed in this paper, it would doubtless be interesting to try and extend the present results to more general Wilson loops and to other\ninstances of gauge/gravity dualities. For example, for the theories we considered with\nd > 4, the various UV completions were discussed in [1] (see also [13]) and involve\nlifting to M-theory (in the case of odd d), or the application of S-duality in the IIB\ncase. We expect these theories to retain the trivial Wilson loop operators we have\nconstructed here as a natural consequence of coupling independence. On a different\nnote, it was pointed out earlier in the paper, using both perturbative as well as superspace methods, that eight supercharge SYM theories in 1 \u2264 d \u2264 4 admit Zarembo\nloops. Clearly, this fact can be used to carry out non-trivial tests for any candidate\ngravity dual for these theories.\nIn the special case of three spacetime dimensions, the recent developments due\nto Bagger, Lambert and Gustavsson (BLG) [16, 17, 18, 19] and Aharony, Bergman,\nJafferis and Maldacena (ABJM) [20] relate the sixteen supercharge SYM theory to\nsuperconformal Chern-Simons (SCS) theories. The N = 8 SCS theory proposed by\nBLG, which can also be recovered as a special case of the ABJM model, is believed\nto be related to the IR limit of the sixteen supercharge SYM theory. It is interesting\nto note that Wilson loops that preserve global supersymmetries have also been constructed for the ABJM model in [21, 22, 23, 24]. In the present paper, we have shown\nthat Zarembo loops exist in the SYM theory both at weak and at strong coupling. It\nthus seems plausible that one can uncover a precise relationship between the Zarembo\nloops of the SYM theory and the corresponding operators in the BLG model. Perhaps, the formal relationship between the Lagrangians of the two theories, elucidated\nin [25], can prove to be fruitful to uncover this aspect of the M2/D2 duality.\nOn a related note, it would be extremely interesting to explore connections between Wilson loops and scattering amplitudes. The relations between these two\nclasses of gauge theory observables, first studied in the context of N = 4 SYM in\nd = 4 [26, 27, 28, 29, 30] can potentially exist for three dimensional Yang-Mills theories as well. The matrix structure of all 2 \u2194 2 scattering amplitudes for N \u2265 4 SCS\ntheories was recently explored in [31]. This study includes the BLG model, which\nis expected to be the strong coupling dual of the sixteen supercharge SYM theory.\nA further study of Wilson loops in the three dimensional gauge theory is obviously\n16\n\n\fneeded to fill the missing connections between Wilson loops and scattering amplitudes both in the SYM theory as well as its dual strong-coupling description as a\nSCS theory.\n\nAcknowledgements\nD.Y. acknowledges the support of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research\nCouncil of Canada (NSERC) in the form of a Postdoctoral Fellowship, and also support from the Volkswagen Foundation.

Therefore here we will present the analysis for\nthe cases p 6= 3.\nThe Killing spinor equations for the geometries (23) are obtained by demanding\nthat the variation of the dilatino \u03bb and gravitino \u03c8M vanish on the supergravity\nsolution.

The extra potentials, in the absence of fermionic\nand NS-NS fields, are simply given by the action of Hodge duality upon the field strengths.\n\n17\n\n\fwhere we have used the fact that on the solution (23) the dilaton \u03c6 depends only on\nthe coordinate U, while F(p+2) = F0...p U where 0, . . . , p denote the p + 1 coordinates\nxq.\nFor convenience we scale the Cp and \u03b1\u2032 dependence out of the metric, which is\nequivalent to replacing \u03b1\u2032 , Cp \u2192 1.
