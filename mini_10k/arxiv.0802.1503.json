We\nidentify a continuous but sharp transition from a straight to an helical shape, resulting from the\ncompetition between viscous stresses and elastic forces. This induced helicity generates a propulsive\nforce along the axis of rotation. In addition, we show that the shape transition is associated with\nan unstable branch in the force-torque relation, confirming the numerical predictions of Manghi\net al. [13]. A linearized model of the fluid-structure interaction is proposed to account for all the\nfeatures of the non-linear filament dynamics.\n\nMany cells use the beating of elastic filaments to swim\nor to pump fluids [1]. Prominent examples are the swimming of sperm cells which propel themselves by exciting propagative deformations along a single flagellum [2],\nand the pumping of liquid by the helical motion of cilia\non embryo nodal cells [3]. Since the pioneering work of\nTaylor in the early 50s, the observation of these fascinating biological machines has inspired numerous studies on the fluid-structure interaction of flexible filaments\nwith viscous flows. Moreover, recent advances in the construction of complex colloidal assembly [4, 5] and in the\ncoupling of biological machines to artificial microstructures [7] should allow man-made swimmers to catch up\nwith microorganisms. A promising example has already\nbeen proposed by Dreyfus et.al. who have quantitavely\nstudied the propulsion of the first artificial flexible microswimmer [6]. So far, special attention has been paid to\nthe thrust produced by the periodic and planar oscillations of an isolated flagella [6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. However,\nin the last two years, a set of numerical and theoretical\nworks [13, 14] has been devoted to another propulsion\nmechanism, the rotation of a single tilted flexible rod.\nIn this paper we present an experimental realization\nof this system. We show that, increasing the angular velocity, \u03c9, the filament undergoes a sharp but continuous\nshape transition from a linear to an helical shape tightly\nwrapped around the rotation axis. We show that this\ncollapse of the flexible rod is solely ruled by the interplay\nbetween the elastic forces and the viscous drag acting\non it. The relation between the filament shape, the axial force and the rotation torque acting on the filament\nis investigated using a high resolution imaging method\nand described quantitatively thanks to a simple model of\nthe fluid-structure interaction. We also give experimental\nevidence that a torque-controlled rotation should lead to\nstrongly non linear and unstable filament dynamics [13].\nWe rotate a flexible filament immersed in a transparent\nplexiglas tank (dimensions 20 x 20 x 20 cm3 ) filled with\npure glycerin. The shear viscosity, \u03b7, of the glycerin has\nbeen systematically measured prior to each experiment.\nWe did not measure any change due to possible tempera-\n\nFIG. 1: Top left: front and side view of a rotating filament.\nRight: reconstructed 3D shape of the filament (solid line) and\nslope at the anchoring point (dashed line).

The filaments\nare made of a low modulus polyvinylsiloxane elastomer.\nGlass capillary tubes are filled with a mixture of polymer and curing agent containing dispersed iron carbonyl\nparticles intended to match the density of glycerin. Once\nthe polymer is cured the glass capillary is broken to recover a cylindrical elastic rod of radius a = 435 \u03bcm, which\nlength varies from 2 cm to 10 cm. The Young's modulus\nE = 0.7 MPA of each rod was measured by dynamical\nmechanical analysis. The filaments are then attached to\nthe axis of an electric motor delivering a discrete set of\nrotation speeds ranging from 0.01 to 10 rpm through a\ngear box. In all our experiments, the motor axis and\nthe filament at rest make an angle \u03b8 of 15\u25e6 . We simultaneously take pictures of the rotating filaments in two\nperpendicular directions with a 6 MPixels digital camera\n(Nikon D70). Eventually, we use a correlation algorithm\n\n\f2\n\n1\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n10\n\nd(L)/L\n\n\u03c6(L) (rad)\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\nFIG. 3: Sketch of the filament deformations in the (x,z) and\n(y,z) planes illustrating the definition of the displacement\nfield r(s) = (r1 (s), r2 (s)).

After a transient regime the rotating\nfilament reaches a stationary shape and undergoes a rigid\nbody rotation. The shortest rods are hardly deformed by\nthe viscous flow even when the rotation speed is increased\nby 3 orders of magnitude. They rapidly adopt a slightly\nchiral shape close to the initial straight and tilted conformation. The rods with intermediate lengths display a\ncontinuous but sharp transition from an almost straight\nto an helical shape when increasing the angular velocity,\nfigure 2. The longest rods are significantly bent by the\nviscous drag; after a long transient regime (\u223c 1 hour),\nthey are tightly wrapped around the rotation axis even\nat the slowest rotation speed. In all that follows, we restrain our attention only to the final stationary shapes.\nTo go beyond the above qualitative observations, the\ndimensionless distance to the rotation axis, d(L)/L and\nthe polar angle \u03c6(L) of the rod end are plotted in figure 2 as a function of the non dimensional rotation speed\nSp \u2261 \u03c9\u03b7\u22a5 L4 /\u03ba. Sp is commonly referred to as the sperm\nnumber, it compares the period of angular rotation to the\n\nelasto-viscous relaxation time, \u03c4 = \u03b7\u22a5 L4 /\u03ba, of the bending mode of wavelength L [9, 15], where \u03ba = \u03c0Ea4 /4 is\nthe bending modulus of the filament and \u03b7\u22a5 is the drag\ncoefficient for normal motion. First of all, it is worth\nnoticing that all the experimental data collapse on the\nsame master curve, which implies that the deformation\nof the rods results from the competition between viscous\nand elastic forces.\nAt low Sp, the polar angle \u03c6(L) increases linearly with\n\u03c9 whereas d(L)/L remains constant over more than two\ndecades. Above Sp \u2248 10, the variation of the polar angle\nbecomes much weaker. Conversely, the distance to the\nrotation axis drops down to a very small value. Surprisingly, a quantitative description of this wrapping transition can be performed ignoring both geometrical nonlinearities and long-range hydrodynamic coupling. To\ndetermine the filament shape we compute the elastic and\nthe viscous forces acting on the flexible rod. Using a local\ndrag description the viscous force is\nfv = (\u03b7k \u2212 \u03b7\u22a5 )(t.v)t + \u03b7\u22a5 v,\n\n(1)\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\nwith t the tangent\n\u0003 = 4\u03c0\u03b7/ log(L/a) + 2\n\u0002 vector, \u03b71\u22a5\nand \u03b7k = 2\u03c0\u03b7/ log(L/a) \u2212 2 the drag coefficients in\nthe slender body approximation [16]. The elastic force\nfe derives from the bending energy functional written\nthe small deformations approximation E =\nR within\n1\n2 2\n\u03ba(\u2202\nr)\nds, with s the curvilinear coordinate. r(s) =\ns\n2\n(r1 (s), r2 (s)) is the displacement field normal to the\nundeformed filament, see Figure 3. Ignoring the incompressibility constraint which would only add extra\nnonlinear contributions to the linearized elastic force:\nfe = \u2212\u03ba\u2202s4 r, the filament shape can then be exactly computed by solving the force balance equation fe = \u2212fv\nin the frame rotating at \u03c9 around the z axis. Introducing the penetration length of the bending modes\n\n\f3\nl(\u03c9) \u2261 [\u03ba/(\u03b7\u22a5 \u03c9 cos \u03b8)]1/4 this equation can be written\nin the compact form:\n\nl\n\n4\n\n(\u03c9)\u2202s4 r2\n\n= r1 .\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nwith the torque and force free conditions at s = L:\n\u2202s2 r(L) = \u2202s3 r(L) = 0 and the geometrical constraints\non the rotation axis: r(0) = \u2202s r(0) = 0. The excellent\nagreement between the theoretical and the measured geometrical parameters plotted in Figure 2 demonstrates\nthat this simplified approach correctly captures the main\nfeatures of the filament dynamics. Although this linear\nequation can be solved analytically, the form of the exact solution is so complex that it is not really insightful. We rather detail here the two asymptotic regimes\nSp \u223c [L/l(\u03c9)]4 \u226a 1 and Sp \u223c [L/l(\u03c9)]4 \u226b 1 corresponding to almost straight and tightly wrapped rods respectively. In the limit of large l(\u03c9) (low speeds), the solution\nof the two above equations is:\ni\nL tan \u03b8 h\nSp 20 (s/L)2 \u2212 (10s/L)3 + (s/L)5 (4)\nr1 = \u2212\n120\nr2 = O(Sp2 ) .\n(5)\nIt then follows that the rotation mostly bends the filament in the flow direction, the distance d(L) is thus\nexpected to remain constant at low speed. Conversely,\nsince the filament responds linearly to the viscous flow,\nthe wrapping angle \u03c6 \u223c r1 (L)/(L sin \u03b8) increases linearly with Sp: \u03c6 = (11/120)Sp. These two predictions thus correctly capture the main features of two\nexperimental observations reported in Figure 2. In the\nlimit of small l(\u03c9) (high speeds), Eqs. 2 and 3 reduce to\nr2 (s) = \u2212s tan \u03b8 and r1 = 0. This immediately tells us\nthat the filament is now completely aligned along the rotation axis in this high speed regime. More precisely, the\nflow induces a strong bending of the filament but the curvature is only localized in a region of length l(\u03c9) near the\nanchoring point on the z axis. This explains the surprising collapse seen in our experimental pictures, Figure 2.\nOur second main objective is now to assess the impact of\nthis rotation-induced wrapping on the (propulsive) axial\nforce F created by the flow and on the torque required\nto enforce the stationary rotation.\nWe first focus our attention on the variation of the\naxial force in an angular velocity-controlled experiment.\nOur accurate filament detection\nalgorithm enables us to\nR\nmeasure axial force F = fv (s) * ez ds values as low as\n3 nN. Contrary to what would be observed with a rigid filament, we systematically measure a non zero axial force.\nMoreover the direction of the force is independent of the\nsign of the angular velocity. This can be understood by\nlooking at the symmetry of the deformed filaments. A\npositive (resp. negative) \u03c9 induces left- (resp. right) handed helical stationary deformations to the initially\nstraight flexible rods.

Dimensional\nanalysis then implies that F should scale as Fe Sp2 , where\nwe define the elastic force Fe \u2261 \u03ba/L2 .

This figure shows that F continuously increases\nwith the dimensionless angular speed and reveals a second power-law regime in the other asymptotic limit. For\nSp > 10, the force scales as F \u223c Fe Sp1/2 . We notice\nthat the crossover between the two power-law behaviors\noccurs in the narrow range of Sp where the filament starts\nbending towards the z-axis.\nBesides, we have shown that the elastic deformations\nof the filament are localized over a length l(\u03c9) in the\ntightly wrapped conformations.

On the one hand, operating at a\nconstant rotational speed ensures a very stable swimming speed. On the other hand, choosing a working point\nclose to the discontinuous shape transition would allow\nfor strong accelerations triggered by a slight variation of\nthe torque command. An interesting issue which goes beyond the scope of this paper deals with the efficiency of\nsuch a propulsive mechanism, both in the pumping and\nthe swimming regimes [18].\nH. Stone and R.

Hence, we can deduce the evolution of the axial force in a torque-driven experiment from this measured torque. The axial force normalized by the elastic\nforce is plotted versus T /Te in Figure 5, with the elastic\ntorque Te \u2261 \u03ba/L. Contrary to what is observed for the\nforce-velocity relation the axial force is a non monotonic\nfunction of the applied torque. We stress on the surprising decrease of the force with T for T \u223c 0.2Te . This\ncounterintuitive behavior is actually observed for sperm\nnumbers for which the filament collapses on the z axis.\nA decreasing branch in the torque-force diagram implies\nthat a torque-driven filament would undergo a discontinuous structural transition. This confirms the observations made by Manghi et al. in Stokesians numerical simulations [17]. Eventually we also emphasize the remarkable robustness of our simple modeling in accounting for\nthe fluid-structure interaction. This linear model yields\nagain an excellent prediction of these strongly nonlinear\nvariations of the force with the driving torque (Figure 5).\n\n[1] D.
