Introduction\nVery peculiar magnetic, thermal, and transport properties of 4f electron based heavy\nfermion systems are determined by the interplay of the strong repulsion of 4f electrons\non the rare-earth ion sites, their hybridization with wide band conduction electrons, and\nan influence of the crystalline electrical field. Consequences of the mentioned interplay\nfor the electronic energy band structure near the Fermi-energy (EF ) were recently\nstudied in YbRh2 Si2 and YbIr2 Si2 by angle-resolved photoemission and interpreted\nwithin the periodic Anderson model [1, 2]. It was found that the hybridization of\n4f electrons results in a rather flat 4f band near EF . Additionally, renormalization of\nthe valence state leads to the formation of a heavy band that reveals strong 4f character\nclose to EF . Moreover, slow valence fluctuations of the Yb ion may occur between\n4f 13 and closed 4f 14 configurations with an averaged valence value of about +2.9 [3].\nEvidently, these observations are consistent with a metallic behavior with very heavy\ncharge carriers having properties of a Landau Fermi-liquid (LFL). At the same time the\nthermal, magnetic, and transport measurements show that the heavy fermions with a\nwell defined Fermi-surface survive only at very low temperatures, coexisting with longrange antiferromagnetic (AF) order (TN = 70 mK in YbRh2 Si2 ) which is suppressed at a\nmagnetic quantum critical point (QCP) [4] by an external magnetic field (at Hc = 600 G,\nTN \u2192 0 K if c axis \u22a5 H ). With further increasing magnetic field at temperatures\nbelow a characteristic temperature T \u2217 , roughly proportional to H \u2212 Hc , a crossover to\nLFL behavior is found. At temperatures above TN and T \u2217 , but below the single ion\nKondo temperature TK , the properties of the discussed materials are quite unusual and\ndisplay a non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior. The underlying fluctuations at the QCP are\ndiscussed to be locally critical, i.e. all the low-energy degrees of freedom have an atomic\nlength scale [4, 5]. One of the hallmarks of this local criticality is a generalized CurieWeiss law like \u03c7 \u221d T \u2212\u03b1 + const for the magnetic susceptibility with an exponent \u03b1 < 1\n[5, 6]. This type of behavior with \u03b1 = 0.75 was found first in CeCu5.9 Au0.1 [6]. The\npeculiarities of these properties are related to the competition between two interactions,\noriginating both from the above mentioned hybridization: an exchange coupling of the\nlocal moments with the broadband conduction electrons (Kondo interaction) and an\ninduced indirect RKKY interaction between the moments. The importance of the local\nproperties in magnetic dynamics was mainly confirmed by the discovery of a strong and\nrather narrow electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) in YbRh2 Si2 and YbIr2 Si2 below\nthe Kondo temperature TK = 25 K and TK = 40 K, respectively (TK revealed by specific\nheat data) [7, 8, 9]. This EPR signal was quite unexpected, since it was believed that\nthe Yb3+ magnetic moment at T < TK should be screened by the conduction electrons\nand that the EPR linewidth should reach large values \u2206H \u221d kB TK /g\u03bcB by approaching\nto TK from above. Moreover, the main features of the observed EPR signal (anisotropy\nof the g factor and the EPR linewidth) reflect local properties of the Yb3+ ion in the\ncrystal electric field. The integrated intensity of the EPR line is proportional to the\nhomogeneous static magnetic susceptibility.

Yb3+ ion in tetragonal crystal field\nA free Yb3+ ion has a 4f 13 configuration with one term 2 F . As the spin-orbital coupling\nis much stronger than the crystal field in our compounds, the total momentum J is\na good quantum number. The spin-orbital interaction splits the 2 F term into two\nmultiplets: 2 F7/2 with total momentum J = 7/2 and 2 F5/2 with J = 5/2. Both are\nseparated by about 1 eV [10] and therefore we will consider only the ground multiplet\n2\nF7/2 . The potential of the tetragonal crystal field for an ion can be written as\nV = \u03b1B20 O20 + \u03b2(B40 O40 + B44 O44 ) + \u03b3(B60 O60 + B64 O64 ).\n\n(1)\n\nTo define energy levels and wave functions of the Yb3+ ion we have to diagonalize\nthe matrix of the operator (1) on the states of the ground multiplet 2 F7/2 . In\n(1) Bkq are crystal field parameters, the operators Okq (J) their matrix elements and\n\u03b1 = 2/63, \u03b2 = \u22122/1155, \u03b3 = 4/27027 are given in [10].\nAs follows from the group theory, the two-valued irreducible representation D7/2 of\nrotation group contains two two-dimensional irreducible representations \u0393t7 and \u0393t6 of\nthe double tetragonal group D7/2 = 2\u0393t7 + 2\u0393t6 [10]. Therefore the states of Yb3+ in a\ntetragonal field are four Kramers doublets and to diagonalize Hamiltonian (1) we just\nneed to diagonalize two two-dimensional matrices corresponding to the representations\n\u0393t7 and \u0393t6 . Hence, the crystal field splits the lower 2 F7/2 multiplet into four Kramers\ndoublets with energies, wave functions and g factors as given in Table 1. In this table\nupper and lower signs correspond to left and right indexes; \u2191, \u2193 correspond to the\nKramers doublets effective spin projection up and down, c1 = cos(\u03c6c /2), c2 = sin(\u03c6c /2),\na1 = cos(\u03c6a /2), a2 = sin(\u03c6a /2), tan \u03c6a = \u00c3/A, tan \u03c6c = C\u0303/C, \u2212\u03c0/2 \u2264 \u03c6a , \u03c6c \u2264 \u03c0/2,\nand gJ = 8/7 is the Land\u00e9 g factor. We used parameters A, C, D, \u00c3, C\u0303 which are defined\nby the crystal field parameters:\nA = 4B20 /7 + 8B40 /77 + 80B60 /143, C = 4B20 /21 + 40B40 /77 \u2212 560B60 /429,\n\n\fMagnetic susceptibility of YbRh2 Si2 and YbIr2 Si2\nD = 2B20 /21 \u2212 64B40 /77 \u2212 160B60 /429,\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u00c3 = \u22128 35B44 /385 + 80 35B64 /3003, C\u0303 = \u22128 3B44 /77 \u2212 80 3B64 /1287.\n\n4\n(2)\n\nThe Zeeman energy gJ \u03bcB HJ in the basis |m\u03c3i (m = 1...4, \u03c3 =\u2191, \u2193) of each doublet could\nbe represented by\nHZeeman = gk \u03bcB Hz Sz + g\u22a5 \u03bcB (Hx Sx + Hy Sy )\n\n(3)\n\nwhere H is the magnetic field, S is the effective spin operator with S = 1/2, \u03bcB is\nthe Bohr magneton, gk and g\u22a5 are g factors when the field is applied parallel and\nperpendicular to the c-axis, respectively (Table 1).\nAs was mentioned above the main features of EPR signal observed in YbRh2 Si2 and\nYbIr2 Si2 reflect the local properties of Yb3+ ion. The EPR signal in YbRh2 Si2 and\nYbIr2 Si2 is highly anisotropic [8, 11]. The angular dependence of g factors in these\ncompounds is well described by\nq\n2\nsin2 \u03b8,\n(4)\ng = gk2 cos2 \u03b8 + g\u22a5\nwhere \u03b8 is the angle between magnetic field and crystal c-axis orientations, with\n|gk | = 0.17, |g\u22a5 | = 3.56 for YbRh2 Si2 and |gk | = 0.855, |g\u22a5 | = 3.36 for YbIr2 Si2 at\nT = 5 K. From neutron scattering experiments [12, 13] the intervals between the ground\nKramers doublet and the exited energy levels amount to \u22061 = 17 meV, \u22062 = 25 meV,\n\u22063 = 43 meV for YbRh2 Si2 and \u22061 = 18 meV, \u22062 = 25 meV, \u22063 = 36 meV for\nYbIr2 Si2 . Unfortunately, these four independent values (three energy intervals and one\nparameter which define gk and g\u22a5 , see Table 1) do not allow to determine five crystal\nfield parameters unambiguously.\nFigure 1 represents the diagram of g factors together with the experimental points for\nthe effective g factors of YbRh2 Si2 and YbIr2 Si2 (four points with different signs of\ngk and g\u22a5 ). The solid and dashed parts of the line gk + 2g\u22a5 + 7gJ = 0 in Fig. 1\ncorrespond to the doublets E4 (\u0393t6 ) and E3 (\u0393t6 ), and the solid and dashed parts of the\n2\nellipse (gk \u2212 gJ )2 /4 + g\u22a5\n/3 = 4gJ2 correspond to the doublets E2 (\u0393t7 ) and E1 (\u0393t7 ). It\nis evident from the proximity to the data (symbols in Fig. 1) that only the doublets\nE2 (\u0393t7 ) and E4 (\u0393t6 ) could be considered for the ground state. The theoretical g values\n(i.e. the points on the ellipse and on the line nearest to the experimental points) and the\ncorresponding values of \u03c6c and \u03c6a are given in Table 2. These results are qualitatively\nwell consistent with the experimental ones being at the same time somewhat larger than\nthe measured ones. Similar estimations for g factors were obtained recently in [14].\nA slight difference between experimental and our theoretical values can be explained\nmainly by taking into account the above mentioned the Kondo interaction, i.e. an\nexchange coupling between the 4f electrons of the Yb3+ ion and wide-band conduction\nelectrons.

We used for calculations experimental\nvalues of energy intervals \u2206i . It follows from our calculations that Curie-Weiss and Van\nVleck susceptibilities play different roles in parallel and perpendicular orientations: for\nYbRh2 Si2 the Curie constant in perpendicular orientation C\u22a50 is at least two orders of\nmagnitude larger than the Curie constant in parallel orientation Ck0 whereas the Van\nVleck susceptibility \u03c7V\u22a5V has the same order of magnitude as \u03c7Vk V . For YbIr2 Si2 the\nsituation is significantly different: C\u22a50 and Ck0 differ only by one order of magnitude\nwhereas the Van Vleck part is almost the same as for YbRh2 Si2 .\n4. Comparison with the experimental data\nIt is evident that the measured susceptibility includes both the Yb3+ ions and the\nconduction electrons susceptibilities. In the molecular field approximation the Kondo\ninteraction and RKKY interactions renormalize the total susceptibility [15, 16, 17]:\n0\n\u03c70k,\u22a5 + \u03c70\u03c3 + 2\u03bbk,\u22a5 \u03c70k,\u22a5 \u03c70\u03c3\nCk,\u22a5\n0\n\u03c7k,\u22a5 + \u03c7\u03c3 =\n,\n\u03c7\n=\n,\n(12)\nk,\u22a5\n1 \u2212 (\u03bb2k,\u22a5 \u03c70\u03c3 + \u03b1k,\u22a5 )\u03c70k,\u22a5\nT\nwhere \u03b1k,\u22a5 are additional contributions to the molecular field from the RKKY interaction\n[17].\nThis renormalization leads to a Curie-Weiss law just as in the isotropic case [15]. The\nPauli susceptibility is negligible. We neglected also the renormalization of the Van Vleck\npart of the susceptibility.

It is easy to notice that the experimental data reflect the theoretically\npredicted tendencies according expression (13). Indeed, for YbRh2 Si2 in perpendicular\norientation the main role is played by the Curie-Weiss contribution to susceptibility, but\nin parallel orientation the susceptibility is almost temperature independent and the main\ncontribution comes from the Van Vleck part. For YbIr2 Si2 the role of the Curie-Weiss\nsusceptibility in parallel orientation is more important in comparison with YbRh2 Si2 .\nTable 4 presents the values of the fitting parameters C\u22a5 , \u03c7V\u22a5V , \u03b8\u22a5 and Ck , \u03c7Vk V , \u03b8k for\nYbRh2 Si2 and YbIr2 Si2 (as shown in Fig. 2 for YbRh2 Si2 Ck can be neglected within\nexperimental error). As expected, the values of parameters C\u22a5 and Ck are smaller than\nthe calculated values C\u22a50 and Ck0 . Indeed, as follows from (13), the renormalization of\nthe susceptibility by the interaction with conduction electrons reduces the value of Curie\nconstants because of the antiferromagnetic sign of the exchange integral (J k,\u22a5 < 0) and,\nhence, \u03bbk,\u22a5 < 0.

Discussion\nOur calculations of the magnetic susceptibility of YbRh2 Si2 and YbIr2 Si2 on the basis\nof an entirely local model of the Yb3+ ion in the crystal electric field were stimulated\nby the following reasons. Firstly, the observed EPR signal reflects a number of features,\nwhich are very similar to those expected for Yb3+ ions doped in non-conducting\ncrystals (in particular, the local crystal field symmetry, the value of g factors, the\ntemperature dependence of the EPR intensity, see [10]). Even the EPR linewidth\nshows a temperature dependence that resembles the behaviour of Yb3+ ions diluted\nin a conducting environment [7, 15]. Secondly, an intensive experimental study of\nthe NFL magnetic and thermal properties of these materials points out locally critical\nfluctuations. Thirdly, the calculations for the used local model could be performed in a\nstraightforward and transparent way.\n\n\fMagnetic susceptibility of YbRh2 Si2 and YbIr2 Si2\n12\n\nYbRh2Si2\n\n\u03c7 \u22a5 (10\n\n-6\n\n3\n\nm /mol)\n\n10\n\n\u0391T\n\n8\n6\n4\n\n10\n\nCurie-Weiss and Van Vleck\n\n-0.75\n\n\u0391T\n\n+const.\n\n-0.6\n\n+const.\n\n2\n0\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\nT (K)\n\n1\n\nFigure 4. Fitting of the ac susceptibility data without additional dc field from [18] by\nthe power law (15) with \u03b1 = 0.6 (dotted line), \u03b1 = 0.75 (dashed line) and by expression\n(13) (solid line) with parameters shown in Table 4.\n\nOur major result is a remarkable agreement of our local approach for the static magnetic\nsusceptibility with the temperature dependence of the experimental data. Therefore, in\nthe considered region of temperatures (0.1 \u2212 30 K) a ballistic motion of the 4f electrons\nis practically absent, and they could be considered as quasi-localized. However, when\napproaching lower temperatures ferromagnetic quantum critical fluctuations dominate\n[4, 18] and a locally quantum critical scenario may be applicable [5]. One of the\nhallmarks of this scenario is a generalized Curie-Weiss law which for a wavevectordependent magnetic susceptibility can be written in the form\nC\n\u03c7(q, T ) = \u03b1\n(15)\nT + \u03b8(q)\u03b1\nwith an exponent \u03b1 < 1 [5, 6]. In the case of YbRh2 Si2 such a behaviour was revealed\nin the temperature region 0.3 < T < 10 K for q = 0, with \u03b1 = 0.6 and \u03b8 = 0\n[18]. As shown in Fig. 4, we point out that a Curie-Weiss law together with a Van\nVleck contribution convincingly describes the data for a wider temperature region in\ncomparison with equation (15) and down to temperatures just above the AFM ordering\ntemperature. However, for the temperature region shown in Fig. 4 the fitting parameters\nfor the low temperature region are considerably changed, see Table 4. The reduction of\nthe Curie constant C and Weiss temperature (\u03b8 = 0.22 K), as well as an increase of the\ntemperature independent contribution can be related to the approach of the system to\nthe LFL regime with a more ballistic motion of the 4f electrons and indicate the Kondo\neffect in the magnetic susceptibility data. In this respect a Curie-Weiss description\nwell within the Kondo regime, i.e. at T \u001c TK , despite successful, may appear not\nappropriate. However, strong ferromagnetic correlations, as indicated, for instance,\n\n\fMagnetic susceptibility of YbRh2 Si2 and YbIr2 Si2\n\n11\n\nby a large Sommerfeld-Wilson ratio for YbRh2 Si2 [18] and YbIr2 Si2 [9], dominate the\nmagnetic susceptibility and may lead to this Curie-Weiss behavior. The reduction of\nthe Curie constant can also be observed experimentally when comparing the magnetic\nsusceptibility per Yb ion of YbRh2 Si2 with Y1\u2212x Ybx Pd3 (x = 0.6%) where the 4f\nelectrons are not hybridized with the conduction electrons [19]. Interestingly, the Yb3+\nEPR intensity of the YPd3 :Yb system compares well with the EPR intensity of YbRh2 Si2\n[19]. In respect of this, yet unexplained observation, it is worth to mention that in\nspite of the success of our entirely local approach for the static magnetic susceptibility\nof YbRh2 Si2 this model is insufficient for a proper theoretical understanding of the\ndynamical susceptibilities as observed by EPR. We have found that this problem can\nbe considered by taking into account a translational diffusion of 4f electrons and\ntheir collective response together with wide-band conduction electrons to the resonant\nmagnetic alternating field (the bottleneck regime). However, a discussion of this problem\nis beyond the scope of this paper and results will be published elsewhere.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the Volkswagen Foundation (I/82203) and partially by the\nRF President Program \"Leading scientific schools\" 2808.2002.2; A.M.S. was supported\npartially by cooperative Grant Y4-P-07-15 from the CRDF BRHE Program and from\nthe RF Ministry of Education and Science, RNP. 2.2.2.3.10028.\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n\nDanzenb\u00e4cher S et al 2007 Phys.
