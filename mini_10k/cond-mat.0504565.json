Instead of the usual four-point integral equation for the polarizability, we obtain\na two-point one, that leads to excellent optical absorption and energy loss spectra. The corresponding three-point vertex function and self-energy are then simply calculated via an integration, for\nany level of approximation. Moreover, we show the direct impact of this formulation on the timedependent density-functional theory. Numerical results for the band gap of bulk silicon and solid\nargon illustrate corrections beyond the GW approximation for the self-energy.\nPACS numbers: 71.10.-w, 71.15.-m, 71.35.-y, 78.20.Bh\n\nThe electronic structure of materials and its response\nto an external perturbation are key quantities for the interpretation of many experimental results or for the design of technological devices. In this context, ab initio\nelectronic structure calculations have become a tool of\nchoice. One can already obtain useful information about\nthe band structure thanks to the widely used Kohn-Sham\n(KS) framework of the Density-Functional Theory (DFT)\n[1]; for the response function, one can use an independent particle Fermi's golden rule (which is equivalent to\nthe Random Phase Approximation (RPA)). Beyond this,\nstate-of-the-art calculations for solids are based on the\nMany-Body Perturbation Theory (MBPT). In that case,\nquasi-particle (QP) band structure energies are obtained\nfrom the solution of an equation similar to the KS one,\nbut with the KS exchange-correlation (xc) potential vxc\nreplaced by the electron self-energy \u03a3, most often using\nHedin's GW approximation [2]. In this approximation, \u03a3\nis the product of the one-particle Green's function G and\nthe screened Coulomb interaction W calculated in the\nRPA. The resulting band structures, and in particular\nthe band gap, are generally much closer to the measured\nones than the KS results [3]. In order to get improved\nresponse functions, the electron-hole interaction can then\nbe included by adding the so-called \"vertex corrections\"\nbeyond the RPA, which is done in practice by solving the\nfour-point Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) for the polarizability P ; this leads in general to excellent absorption\nand electron energy-loss spectra [4]. In particular, one\ncorrectly describes the important excitonic effects. When\nneeded [5], one could then use the vertex and the improved response function to construct a new self-energy\nbeyond the RPA GW approximation.\n\nited to relatively simple systems. Cancellation effects on\nquasi-particle energies between the vertices in P and \u03a3\nhave been discussed only for selected cases, especially for\nthe homogeneous electron gas [8], or for bulk silicon but\nusing a vertex derived from a local approximation to the\nself-energy, namely the KS potential in the local density\napproximation (LDA) [9]. It is therefore an important\nchallenge to find an efficient way to evaluate the effects\nof vertices arising from more realistic KS potentials, or\nbetter, from non-local self-energies.\nAlternatively, it is known that in principle one could\nobtain the polarizability directly from a two-point equation: this is the case when one works in the framework of time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) [10], since one\npropagates the density instead of the Green's function.\nTDDFT could therefore clearly be a prominent alternative to the BSE for the calculation of P . Recently, a\nreliable (long-range) approximation for the two-point xc\nkernel fxc (r, r\u2032 , t, t\u2032 ) of the TDDFT linear response equation for P has been derived from the BSE; this combines\nthe precision of the latter with the computational advantages of TDDFT [11]. TDDFT is of course not designed\nto access one-QP properties, like the band structure; yet,\none may try to use the progress made concerning P in\norder to find approximations for \u03a3 beyond the GW approximation, and a first attempt in this sense has already\nbeen made concerning QP lifetimes [6].\nThe ultimate goal would be of course to combine the\ndensity-functional and the QP concepts in such a way\nthat systematic and efficient improvements to the spectroscopic quantities of interest could be obtained. In this\nwork, we show how this goal can be reached.\nWe start from the Dyson equation\n\nUnfortunately, calculations of vertex corrections\nare cumbersome essentially because of the four-point\n(electron-hole scattering) nature of the BSE (see e.g. [4]\nfor the BSE, or [6, 7] for the self-energy beyond GW).\nCalculations of the response function have been lim-\n\nG\u22121 (12) = G\u22121\n0 (12) \u2212 V (1)\u03b4(12) \u2212 \u03a3(12)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere (12) stands for two space, time and spin coordinates (r1 t1 \u03c31 , r2 t2 \u03c32 ), G0 is the free-particle Green's\nfunction, and V (1) = U (1) + VH (1), the total classical\n\n\f2\npotential, where U is a time-dependent external potential that goes to the static physical potential at times \u00b1\u221e\nand whose fictious time-dependent part will be made vanishing at the end of the derivation, and VH is the Hartree\npotential. One can express the self-energy in terms of\nvariations of the Green's function with respect to the external potential, \u03a3 = \u2212ivG\u03b4G\u22121 /\u03b4U [2], or\n\u03a3(12) = iG(14)\u0393(42; 5)\n\n\u03b4V (5)\nv(31+ ),\n\u03b4U (3)\n\n\u03b4G\u22121 (12)\n\u03b4\u03a3(12)\n= \u03b4(13)\u03b4(23)+\n\u03b4V (3)\n\u03b4V (3)\n\n(3)\n\nand v the bare Coulomb interaction (integration over indices not present on the left is implicit throughout the\npaper). Disregarding \u03a3 on the right-hand side of Eq. (3)\nwould yield the GW approximation.\nThe derivative \u03b4\u03a3/\u03b4V is usually replaced by the chain\nrule (\u03b4\u03a3/\u03b4G)(\u03b4G/\u03b4V ), which, using the relation between\nthe derivatives of G and of G\u22121 , leads to the term\n(\u03b4\u03a3/\u03b4G)GG\u0393 that transforms Eq. (3) into an integral\nequation for \u0393 [2]. This equation, or an equivalent form,\nwith its four-point kernel dominated by \u03b4\u03a3(12)/\u03b4G(34),\nhas to be solved in order to get the irreducible polarizability P = \u2212iGG\u0393 and an improved self-energy from\nEq. (2). This is the main obstacle on the way to a calculation of polarizabilities or self-energies beyond the RPA.\nThe fundamental idea of the present Letter is to benefit\nfrom the Runge-Gross theorem of TDDFT [10] in order\nto rewrite \u03b4\u03a3/\u03b4V in Eq. (3). The one-to-one relation between time-dependent densities and external potentials,\nor consequently between the densities and the classical\npotentials V , allows one to use an alternative chain rule\nto express \u03b4\u03a3/\u03b4V , namely (\u03b4\u03a3/\u03b4\u03c1)(\u03b4\u03c1/\u03b4V ) [18]. This\ntransformation is hence exact whenever the linear response version of TDDFT, which is the only ingredient\nneeded here, is exact [19]. It leaves observables like QP\nenergies of the original equations accessible and suggests\nstraightforward approximations. Equation (3) hence becomes\n\u0393(12; 3) = \u03b4(13)\u03b4(23) +\n\n\u03b4\u03a3(12)\nP (43),\n\u03b4\u03c1(4)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere P = \u03b4\u03c1/\u03b4V is the irreducible polarizability that,\nas explained above, is usually calculated by solving the\nvertex equation. However, by integrating Eq. (4) with\ntwo Green's functions G, one directly obtains\neff\nP (12) = P0 (12) + P0 (13)fxc\n(34)P (42),\n\n(5)\n\nwith P0 (12) = \u2212iG(12)G(21) and the two-point kernel\neff\nfxc\n(34) = \u2212iP0\u22121 (36)G(65)G(5\u2032 6)\n\n\u03b4\u03a3(55\u2032 )\n.\n\u03b4\u03c1(4)\n\n\u03a3(12) = iG(12)W TC-TC (21)\n\n(2)\n\nwith the irreducible vertex function\n\u0393(12; 3) = \u2212\n\nIn other words, one can now first determine the two-point\nirreducible polarizability P from the integral Eq. (5), and\nsubsequently the three-point vertex \u0393 via the integration\nof Eq. (4). From P , the reducible polarizability P red [20]\nis obtained via P red = P + P vP red .\nFinally, the self-energy becomes\n\n(6)\n\n+ iG(14)\n\n\u03b4\u03a3(42) red\nP (53)v(31+ ). (7)\n\u03b4\u03c1(5)\n\nThe first term has the GW form, but with the\ntestcharge-testcharge (TC-TC) screened Coulomb interaction W TC-TC = (1 + vP red )v, instead of the RPA one.\nIt has been discussed [8, 9] that \u03a3 = iGW TC-TC would\nyield unreliable results, because of the cancellation effects\ncoming from the second term. In fact, the term vP red v\ncontributing to W TC-TC creates the induced Hartree potential felt by a classical charge. The additional term\n(\u03b4\u03a3/\u03b4\u03c1)P red is responsible for the missing induced xc potentials that act on an electron or hole. It is therefore\nuseful to reformulate Eq. (4) as\neff\n(14)P (43)+\u2206\u0393(12; 3) (8)\n\u0393(12; 3) = \u03b4(13)\u03b4(23)+\u03b4(12)fxc\n\nwhere\n\u2206\u0393(12; 3) =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\u03b4\u03a3(12)\neff\n\u2212 \u03b4(12)fxc\n(14) P (43).\n\u03b4\u03c1(4)\n\n(9)\n\nThe most important effects are in fact contained in the\nfirst two (one- and two-point) contributions to \u0393 (called\n\u0393(2) in the following), whereas the three-point remainder\n\u2206\u0393 can be interpreted as a subsequent \"non-locality\"\ncorrection. \u2206\u0393 has no effect on P , as one can see by\nintegrating Eq. (9) with two Green's functions and using Eq. (6). In the self-energy of Eq. (7), the inclusion\nof \u0393(2) leads to \u03a3 = iGW\u0303 with a modified screened\neff\nCoulomb interaction W\u0303 = (1 + (v + fxc\n)P red )v. This\nis a testcharge-testelectron (TC-TE) screened Coulomb\ninteraction instead of W TC-TC ; this expresses the fact\nthat an additional electron or hole in the system cannot\nbe described as a classical charge. \u2206\u0393 yields then in \u03a3 a\ncorrection term to this physically intuitive contribution;\nit is entirely due to the non-locality of the self-energy in\nEq. (9).\nEquation (5) is a two-point, but QP-derived, equation for the polarizability. The link with TDDFT can\nbe made by the fact that the diagonal of G yields the\nexact time-dependent density \u2212iG(11+ ) = \u03c1(1) [13].\n\u03b4G/\u03b4\u03c1 = \u2212G(\u03b4G\u22121 /\u03b4\u03c1)G leads to\niG(13)G(41+ )\n\n\u03b4G\u22121 (34)\n= \u03b4(12).\n\u03b4\u03c1(2)\n\n(10)\n\nSince the same exact density, and hence the same\nHartree potential, should also be obtained from the\nKohn-Sham potential vKS = V + vxc we can write\nG\u22121 (12) = G\u22121\n0 (12)\u2212\u03b4(12)(vKS (1)\u2212vxc (1))\u2212\u03a3(12). (11)\n\n\f3\nAs \u03b4G\u22121\n0 /\u03b4\u03c1 = 0, Eq. (10) becomes:\nP0 (13)\u03c7\u22121\n0 (32)\n\n\u03b4\u03a3(34)\n\u2212 iG(13)G(41 )\n\u03b4\u03c1(2)\n\u2212 P0 (13)fxc (32) = \u03b4(12), (12)\n+\n\nwhere \u03c70 (12) = \u03b4\u03c1(1)/\u03b4vKS (2) is the KS independent\nparticle polarizability and fxc (12) = \u03b4vxc (1)/\u03b4\u03c1(2) is the\nxc kernel of TDDFT. This kernel turns out to consist of\n(2)\n(2)\n(1)\ntwo terms, namely fxc and fxc , with fxc exactly equal\neff\nto the fxc\narising from our previous approach and\n\u22121\n(1)\nfxc\n(12) = \u03c7\u22121\n0 (12) \u2212 P0 (12).\n\n(13)\n\n(1)\nfxc\n\nserves to change the KS response function into the\nindependent QP one, in particular, to solve the so-called\n(2)\nband gap problem. fxc accounts for the electron-hole\ninteraction. This splitting [14] is physically intuitive. Altogether, TDDFT yields then for the irreducible polarizability P\n\u22121\neff\nP = \u03c70 + \u03c70 (\u03c7\u22121\n0 \u2212 P0 + fxc )P.\n\n(14)\n\nThis is equivalent to Eq. (5).\neff\nTo get an explicit expression for fxc\n, we choose a starting approximation for the self-energy, and consistent approximations for the functional derivative of \u03a3 and for\nG, on the right side of Eqs. (6) and (7). A simple choice\ncould be to take \u03a3, G and P0 as derived from a local and\nadiabatic xc potential, e.g. the LDA one. This leads of\ncourse to the TDLDA and the GW\u0393 approach of Ref. [9].\nA better choice is to start from the GW approximation\nfor \u03a3, taking W as a screened (e.g. static RPA) Coulomb\ninteraction. For the functional derivative, it is then reasonable (i) to neglect the derivative of W as usually done\nin the BSE: (ii) to approximate \u03b4G/\u03b4\u03c1 = \u2212G(\u03b4G\u22121 /\u03b4\u03c1)G\nby GP0\u22121 G, truncating the chain of derivatives \u03b4\u03a3/\u03b4\u03c1\nthat would appear if one continued to calculate all terms\nof \u03b4G\u22121 /\u03b4\u03c1 and that would lead to an integral equation\nsimilar to Fig. 2(b) of Ref. [14]. (Note that this is equivalent to supposing G be created by a local potential). We\nobtain hence from Eq. (6)\neff\nfxc\n(34) = P0\u22121 (36)G(65)G(5\u2032 6)W (55\u2032 )\n\n\u00d7 G(57)G(75\u2032 )P0\u22121 (74). (15)\nEquation (15) is the electron-hole xc kernel of Refs. [11,\neff\n14]. In those works, fxc\nwas derived in two completely\ndifferent ways (by mapping matrix elements of the BSE\nelectron-hole interaction on those of TDDFT, and by a\nfirst-order expansion in W , respectively) and extensively\ntested for the dielectric function, with excellent results.\nIn other words, the results of Refs. [11, 14] yield the\nnumerical validation of the present derivation whereas,\nin turn, the latter a posteriori yields new physical insight about why the former had led to such (unexpect-\n\nSi\nAr\n\nLDA\n2.53\n8.18\n\nGW RP A GW TC-TC GW\u0303 Expt.\n3.17\n3.08\n3.18 3.40\n12.95\n12.64\n12.75 14.2\n\nTABLE I: Direct gap (in eV) at \u0393 in bulk silicon and solid\nargon, calculated using a local approximation (LDA) for the\nstarting self-energy (see text).\nCOHSEX GW RP A GW TC-TC GW\u0303 Expt.\nSi\n3.64\n3.30\n3.18\n3.32 3.40\nAr 14.85\n14.00\n14.16\n14.76 14.2\nTABLE II: Same as Table I, but based on a non-local approximation (COHSEX) for the starting self-energy.\n\nedly) good results: the physics of the variation of the selfenergy upon excitation, which gives rise to the electronhole interaction, can be captured in terms of density variations only. This is very important, since it encourages\nthe use of the present scheme also for cases where one\nwishes to go beyond the above approximations.\nIt is interesting to see what one obtains when using this\nscheme to go beyond the GW approximation for the calculation of band gaps in semiconductors and insulators.\nSince systematic GW\u0393 studies in literature are available\nonly for a short-range (LDA) kernel [9], we provide here\na discussion on the influence of a long-range contribution\non QP energies.\nFor illustration, we present in Tables I and II results\non bulk silicon and solid argon (obviously, the effect of\na long-range contribution is particularly interesting in\na solid, and silicon and argon represent two extreme\ncases, the first one with strong screening and continuum\nexcitons, the second one with almost no screening and\nstrongly bound electron-hole pairs).\nThe first series of results, presented in Table I, uses\nLDA as starting approximation for the right-hand side\nof Eq. (7), whereas the second series in Table II uses\nthe static but nonlocal \"Coulomb-hole-plus-screened exchange\" (COHSEX) approximation to GW [2]. In the\neff\nlatter case, we use the kernel fxc\ngiven by Eq. (15) which,\nalthough approximate, has the correct long-range behaviour [11, 15]. Furthermore, LDA wavefunctions are\nused throughout: we suppose them to be similar to the\nCOHSEX QP ones [21].\nThe two tables show the band gap at \u0393 for both materials under study. The first column gives the band gap\nthat is obtained from the respective starting approximation (i.e. LDA or COHSEX). The second column uses\nthis band structure, and provides the subsequent standard non-self-consistent GW RP A . Columns 3 and 4 show\nthe band gap for the approximations to the self-energy\nderived in this work, using either W TC-TC (first part of\nEq. (7)) or W\u0303 (neglect of only \u2206\u0393). Finally, the experi-\n\n\f4\nmental value is given in the last column [17]. Both materials show similar tendencies. In particular, there is\na significant influence of the single-particle energies on\nthe GW RP A (second columns). The choice of COHSEX\nenergies in W simulates the effect of the contribution\n(1)\nfxc of Eq. (13). In most cases, the electron-hole vertex\n(2)\neff\ncorrection fxc\n= fxc in W T C\u2212T C closes the gap (third\neff\ncolumns) with respect to RPA. When fxc\nis included\naccording to Eq. (7) in order to evaluate the explicit vertex in \u03a3 = iGW T C\u2212T C \u0393(2) = iGW\u0303 (fourth columns),\nthere is a strong opening of the gap. Our most complete result is hence determined by a series of cancellations. The overall behaviour of both kernels under study\n(arising from LDA or the non-local COHSEX scheme) is\nvery similar, even though the LDA kernel does not have\nthe crucial, correct long-range contribution [15]. These\nresults roughly justify calculations using the RPA GW\nform constructed with QP energies instead of KS ones.\nThe GW \u0393 gap turns out to be slightly bigger than the\nexperimental value. In order to obtain improved agreement, one should of course avoid some of the above approximations; in particular we expect the non-locality\ncorrection to decrease the gap, since the neglected term\nshould reduce the effect of the external vertex. Those\nand other more sophisticated numerical calculations (including, e.g., self-consistency in the wavefunctions) are\nhowever beyond the scope of this illustration.\nIn conclusion, using the concept of the density as crucial quantity we have derived a complete new set of equations for the many-body vertex, polarizability and selfenergy. This approach does not require the solution of\nintegral equations containing a four-point kernel. In particular, the polarizability is directly obtained from a twopoint equation, containing a two-point many-body kereff\n, which completely changes the way e.g. excinel fxc\ntonic effects can be calculated. We have shown that the\nsame expression for the polarizability can also be derived\nfrom the relation between the Green's function and the\ncharge density. Moreover the latter derivation yields the\nexchange-correlation kernel of TDDFT, which turns out\neff\nto differ from fxc\nby a term that is essentially responsible\nfor the gap correction. Our approach explains the success of previously published approximations for the kernel and allows one to go beyond in a systematic way. On\nthe other hand, it opens the way for better approximations to the self-energy and other many-body quantities.\nFor the gap corrections in bulk silicon and solid argon,\nwe have put into evidence cancellation effects of different\ncontributions to the vertex corrections beyond the GW\napproximation.\nWe are grateful for discussions with C.-O.

Such a procedure would\nindeed lead to a rough approximation.\n[19] An important requirement of TDDFT is a well defined\ninitial state. This is not an issue here as the initial state is,\nby definition of the equilibrium Green's function, the N\nparticle ground-state in absence of any time-dependent\nperturbing potential U . Moreover, the linear response\nTDDFT needs weaker requirements than the general case\n[12]. Limiting cases as the example of a stationary current\nin an infinite solid, that one might not be able to handle\nin TDDFT, might instead require additional terms in the\nfunctional derivative; this is however beyond the scope of\nthis work.\n[20] The type of time-dependence of quantities appearing in\nthe equations has to be specified; a clean way is the formulation on the Keldysh contour [12]. In any case, one\nhas of course to use the adequate form when evaluating\n\n\f5\nthe formulas in practice.\n[21] We do not enter here the debated subject of fully self-\n\nconsistent QP calculations (see, e.g., [16])\n\n\f"}
