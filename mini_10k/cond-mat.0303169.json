The arising field of spintronics proposes to use the spin degree of freedom of electrons in place of/in addition\nto the charge degree of freedom for device applications in order to add new features and functionalities\nto semiconductors devices.1,2,3 The hope of the realization of the proposed spintronic devices is supported\nby the resent development of ultrafast nonlinear optical\nexperiments4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17 where long spin\ndephasing time (> 100 ns) is reported.\nThe functionalities of the semiconductor spintronic\ndevices rely on the manipulation of the spin coherence.\nIn order to realize these devices, one\nneeds to thoroughly understand the spin dephasing mechanisms which tend to destroy the spin coherence.\nHistorically, three spin dephasing mechanisms have been proposed in semiconductors:18,19 the\nElliot-Yafet (EY) mechanism,20,21 the D'yakonov-Perel'\n(DP) mechanism,22 and the Bir-Aronov-Pikus (BAP)\nmechanism.23 All of the three mechanisms are either due\nto the spin flip (SF) scattering or are treated as effective\nSF scattering. The spin dephasing times of these mechanisms for low polarized system are calculated in the\nframework of single particle approximation.18 In additional to these single particle spin dephasing mechanisms,\nthree years ago Wu proposed a many-body spin dephasing mechanism which has long been overlooked in the\nliterature. This mechanism is caused by irreversibly disrupting the phases between spin dipoles due to the inhomogeneous broadening together with the spin-conserving\n(SC) scattering,24,25,26,27,28 and is therefore a many-body\neffect. The inhomogeneous broadening can be introduced\nby the energy dependence of g-factor24,25,29 and/or the\nmomentum k-dependence of the DP term.25,26,27 Our recent works further show that this mechanism also plays\nan important role in the spin dephasing during the spin\n\ntransport.30,31\nVery recently we performed a systematic\ninvestigation32,33 of the spin dephasing due to the\nDP effect in n-typed GaAs (100) quantum wells for high\ntemperatures (\u2265 120 K) under magnetic fields in the\nVoigt configuration by constructing and numerically\nsolving the kinetic Bloch equations.24,25,26,27,28,34 In\nthese studies, we include all the SC scattering such as\nthe electron-phonon, the electron-nonmagnetic impurity\nas well as the electron-electron Coulomb scattering and\ninvestigate the spin dephasing under various conditions.\nThe dephasing obtained from our theory contains both\nthe single-particle dephasing caused by the effective SF\nscattering first proposed by D'yakonov and Perel',22\nand the many-body one due to the inhomogeneous\nbroadening provided by the DP term. We show that\nfor the electron densities we studied, the spin dephasing\nrate is dominated by the many-body effect. Moreover,\nas we include the electron-electron Coulomb scattering,\nwe are able to investigate the spin dephasing with extra\nlarge spin polarization (up to 100 %) which has not\nbeen discussed both theoretically and experimentally.\nWe find that under moderate magnetic fields, the SDT\nincreases dramatically with the initial spin polarization.\nFor example, the SDT of a impurity free sample gets\nan increase of more than one order of magnitude when\nthe initial spin polarization rises from about 0 to\nabout 100 % at low temperature.33 The initial-spinpolarization dependence of the spin dephasing becomes\nmore interesting when the magnetic field is increased\nto a few tens tesla where the SDT no longer increases\nmonotonically with the initial spin polarization but\nshows an anomalous resonance peak versus the initial\nspin polarization.32 The dramatic increase and the\nanomalous resonance of SDT in the high spin polarization region is found to be due to the first order of the\nelectron-electron interaction, i.e., the Hartree-Fock (HF)\ncontribution which provides an effective magnetic field\nthat can reduce the spin dephasing and result in a fast\n\n\f2\nincrease of the SDT. Moreover, under right condition,\nthe HF term, the applied magnetic field as well as the\nDP term can reach to a resonance, and thus forms the\nanomalous peak. Due to the small Land\u00e9 g-factor in\nGaAs, the resonance condition can only be achieved\nunder very high magnetic fields.\nIn this paper, we apply the kinetic theory to study the\nspin dephasing in the n-typed InAs QW for high temperatures where the DP term is the leading dephasing\nmechanism. In QW system, the DP term is composed\nof the Dresselhaus term35 and the Rashba term.36,37 The\nDresselhaus term is due to the lack of inversion symmetry\nin the zinc-blende crystal Brillouin zone and is sometimes\nreferred to as bulk inversion asymmetry (BIA) term.\nWhereas the Rashba term appears if the self-consistent\npotential within a QW is asymmetric along the growth\ndirection and is therefore referred to as structure inversion asymmetry (SIA) contribution. For QW's of wide\nband-gap semiconductors such as GaAs, the Dresselhaus\nterm is the main spin dephasing mechanism. Whereas for\nQW's composed of narrow band-gap semiconductors such\nas InAs in the present case, the Rashba term is dominant.\nAs the Rashba term is proportional to the interface electric field of the QW, therefore, the spin dephasing in\nthe InAs QW can be manipulated through applying an\nelectric field perpendicular to the QW. Moreover, as the\nLand\u00e8 g-factor in InAs is very large (g = 15 compared to\n0.44 of GaAs), one expects to achieve the resonance condition under a moderate magnetic field. We organize the\npaper as follows: We present our model and the kinetic\nequations in Sec. II. Then in In Sec. III(A) we investigate\nhow the SDT changes with the variation of the initial\nspin polarization. The temperature dependence of the\nSDT under different spin polarization is discussed in detail in Sec. III(B), where we also highlight the difference\nbetween the present many-body theory and the earlier\nsimplified theory. In Sec. III(C) we show the magnetic\nfield dependence of the SDT. Finally we discuss how the\ninterface electric field affects the SDT. We present the\nconclusion and summary in Sec. IV.\nII.\n\nKINETIC EQUATIONS\n\nWe start our investigation from an n-doped (100) InAs\nQW with well width a. The growth direction is assumed\nto be z-axis. A moderate magnetic field B is applied\n\nalong the x axis. Due to the confinement of the QW,\nthe momentum states along z axis are quantized. Therefore the electron states are characterized by a subband\nindex n and a two dimensional wave vector k = (kx , ky )\ntogether with a spin index \u03c3. In the present paper, we\nchoose the electron density so that only the lowest subband is populated and the transition to the upper subbands is unimportant. Therefore, one only needs to consider the lowest subband. With the DP term (specifically\nthe Rashba term) included, the Hamiltonian of the electrons in the QW takes the form:\n\u001b\nX\u001a\n\u0002\n\u0003 ~\u03c3\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 \u2020\n\u03b5k + g\u03bcB B + h(k) *\nH=\nck\u03c3 ck\u03c3\u2032 + HI . (1)\n2\n\u2032\nk\u03c3\u03c3\n\nHere \u03b5k = k2 /2m\u2217 is the energy of electron with wavevector k and effective mass m\u2217 . ~\u03c3 are the Pauli matrices.\nThe Rashba term h(k) can be written as\nhx (k) = \u03b1ky , hy (k) = \u2212\u03b1kx , hz (k) = 0.\n\n(2)\n\nIn these equations, \u03b1 is proportional to the interface electric field Ez along the growth direction:\n\u03b1 = \u03b10 eEz ,\n\n(3)\n\nwith the coefficient \u03b10 being inversely proportional to\nthe energy gap and the effective mass.38 The interaction Hamiltonian HI is composed of Coulomb interaction\nHee , electron-phonon interaction Hph , as well as electronimpurity scattering Hi . Their expressions can be found\nin textbooks.39,40\nWe construct the kinetic Bloch equations by the\nnonequilibrium Green function method39 as follows:\n\u03c1\u0307k,\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 = \u03c1\u0307k,\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 |coh + \u03c1\u0307k,\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 |scatt\n\n(4)\n\nHere \u03c1k represents the single particle density matrix.\nThe diagonal elements describe the electron distribution functions \u03c1k,\u03c3\u03c3 = fk\u03c3 . The off-diagonal elements\n\u03c1k, 21 \u2212 12 \u2261 \u03c1k describe the inter-spin-band polarizations\n(coherence) of the spin coherence.34 Note that \u03c1k,\u2212 12 21 \u2261\n\u03c1\u2217k, 1 \u2212 1 = \u03c1\u2217k . Therefore, fk\u00b1 12 and \u03c1k are the quantities\n2\n2\nto be determined from Bloch equations.\nThe coherent part of the equation of motion for the\nelectron distribution function and the spin coherence are\ngiven by\n\nX\n\b\n\u2202fk,\u03c3\n|coh = \u22122\u03c3 [g\u03bcB B + hx (k)]Im\u03c1k + hy (k)Re\u03c1k + 4\u03c3Im\nVq \u03c1\u2217k+q \u03c1k ,\n\u2202t\nq\n\nX \u0002\n\u0003\n\u2202\u03c1k\n1\nVq (fk+q 21 \u2212 fk+q\u2212 12 )\u03c1k \u2212 \u03c1k+q (fk 12 \u2212 fk\u2212 21 ) ,\n= [ig\u03bcB B + ihx (k) + hy (k)](fk 12 \u2212 fk\u2212 12 ) + i\ncoh\n\u2202t\n2\nq\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n\f3\nrespectively, where Vq = 4\u03c0e2 /[\u03ba0 (q + q0 )] is the 2D\nCoulomb matrix\nelement under static screening. q0 =\nP\n(e2 m\u2217 /\u03ba0 ) \u03c3 fk=0,\u03c3 and \u03ba0 is the static dielectric constant. The first term on the right hand side (RHS) of\nEq. (5) describes the spin precession of electrons under\nthe magnetic field B as well as the effective magnetic field\nh(k) due to the Rashba effect. The scattering terms of\nthe electron distribution function and the spin coherence\nare given by Eqs. (A1) and (A2) in the Appendix.\nThe initial conditions are taken at t = 0 as:\n\u03c1k |t=0 = 0\n\n(7)\n\n\b\nfk\u03c3 |t=0 = 1/ exp[(\u03b5k \u2212 \u03bc\u03c3 )/kB T ] + 1\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03bc\u03c3 is the chemical potential for spin \u03c3. The condition \u03bc 21 6= \u03bc\u2212 12 gives rise to the imbalance of the electron\ndensities of the two spin bands.\n\nIII.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nThe kinetic Bloch equations form a set of nonlinear\nequations. All the unknowns to be solved appear in the\nscattering terms. Specifically, the electron distribution\nfunction is no longer a Fermi distribution because of the\nexistence of the anisotropic Rashba term h(k). This term\nin the coherent part drives the electron distribution away\nfrom an isotropic Fermi distribution. The scattering term\nattempts to randomize electrons in k-space. Obviously,\nboth the coherent part and the scattering terms have\nto be solved self-consistently to obtain the distribution\nfunction and the spin coherence.\nWe numerically solve the kinetic Bloch equations in\nsuch a self-consistent fashion to study the spin precession between the spin-up and -down bands. We include\nelectron-phonon scattering and the electron-electron interaction throughout our computation. As we concentrate on the relatively high temperature regime in the\npresent study, for electron-phonon scattering we only\nneed to include electron-LO phonon scattering. Electronimpurity scattering is sometimes excluded. As discussed\nin the previous paper,34,41 irreversible spin dephasing can\nbe well defined by the slope of the envelope\nP of the incoherently summed spin coherence \u03c1(t) =\nk |\u03c1k |. The\nmaterial parameters of InAs for our calculation are tabulated in Table I.42 The method of the numerical calculation has been laid out in detail in the previous paper\non the DP mechanism in 3D systems.24 The difference\nis that here we are able to get the results quantitatively\nin stead of only qualitatively as in the previous 3D case,\nthanks to the smaller dimension in the momentum space.\nOur main results are plotted in Figs. 1 to 6. In these calculations the total electron density Ne and the applied\nmagnetic field B are chose to be 4 \u00d7 1010 cm\u22122 and 1.5 T\nrespectively unless otherwise specified.\n\n\u03ba\u221e\n\u03c90\na\n\n12.25\n27 meV\n7.5 nm\n\n\u03ba0\nm\u2217\n\n15.15\n0.00239 m0\n\nTABLE I: Parameters used in the numerical calculations\n\nA.\n\nSpin polarization dependence of the spin\ndephasing time\n\nWe first study the spin polarization dependence of the\nSDT. As our theory is a many-body theory and we include all the scattering, especially the Coulomb scattering, in our calculation, we are able to calculate the SDT\nwith large spin polarization.\nIn Fig. 1, SDT \u03c4 is plotted against the initial spin\npolarization P with Ni = 0 [Fig. 1(a)] and Ni = 0.1Ne\n[Fig. 1(b)] at different temperatures. The most striking\nfeature of the impurity-free case is the huge anomalous\npeaks of the SDT in low temperatures. For T = 120\nK, the peak value of the SDT is about 6 times higher\nthan that of low initial spin polarization. It is also seen\nfrom the figure that the anomalous peak is reduced with\nthe increase of temperature and the peak shifts to higher\npolarization. For T > 200 K there is no anomalous peak.\nThe anomalous peak in the \u03c4 -P curve in low temperature region originates from the electron-electron interaction, specifically the Hartree-Fock (HF) self-energy\n[i.e., the last terms in the Eq. (5) and (6)]. If one\nremoves the HF term, the anomalous peak as well as\nthe large increase of SDT disappears. It is pointed out\nin our previous paper that although the HF term itself\ndoes not contribute to the spin dephasing directly,25,28\nit can alert the motion of the electrons as it behaves as\nan effective magnetic field BHF (k). Therefore, the HF\nterm can affect the spin dephasing by combining with the\nDP term. For small spin polarization as commonly discussed in the literature, the contribution of the HF term\nis marginal. However, when the polarization gets higher,\nthe HF contribution becomes larger. Especially the effective magnetic field formed by the HF term contains a longitudinal component [BzHF (k)] which can effectively reduce the \"detuning\" of the spin-up and -down electrons,\nand thus strongly reduces the spin dephasing, therefore\nthe SDT increases with initial spin polarization.33 Moreover, besides the initial polarization, \u03c1k and therefore\nB HF (k) are also affected by the applied magnetic field.\nWith higher magnetic field, both gets larger. Under the\nhigh magnetic field and when the initial spin polarization reaches to a right value, the effective magnetic field\nBHF (k) may reach the magnitude comparable to the\ncontribution from the DP term as well as the applied\nmagnetic field in the coherent parts of the Bloch equations and reduces the anisotropic caused by the DP term.\nTherefore, one gets much longer SDT. However, if one\nfurther increases the initial polarization, the HF term\n\n\f4\nthe temperature is high enough, even largest polarization P = 100 % cannot make the HF term to reach the\nresonance condition. Therefore, the peak disappears.\nThe \u03c4 -P curve is much different when the impurities\nare introduced. It is seen from Fig. 1(b) that, when the\ndensity of impurity is large, say Ni = 0.1Ne , the fast\nrise in \u03c4 -P curve remains. Nevertheless the increase is\nsmaller than the corresponding one when the impurities\nare absent. In addition to the reduction of the rise in \u03c4 -P\ncurves, the impurities destroy the anomaly too. One can\neasily see that, with the impurity level Ni = 0.1Ne , when\nthe temperature is 120 K, the anomalous peak is much\nflatter than the impurity free sample, while for all other\ntemperatures we study, the SDT increases uniquely with\nthe polarization.\n\nFIG. 1: Spin dephasing time \u03c4 versus the initial spin polarization P with different impurity concentration and different\ntemperatures. The impurity densities in (a) and (b) are 0 and\n0.1Ne respectively. The lines are plotted for the aid of eyes.\n\nexceeds the resonance condition. As the result, the SDT\ndecreases. Therefore, one gets the anomalous peak which\nis similar to the resonance effect. It is noted at, as both\nthe DP term and the HF term are k-dependent, the resonance is broadened.\nFor high temperatures the HF term is smaller. In order\nto reach the resonance, one needs to go to higher polarization. Therefore, as shown in the figure the anomalous\npeak shifts to the higher polarization. However, when\n\nFIG. 2: Spin dephasing time \u03c4 versus the initial spin polarization P for a InAs QW with different impurity levels.\nCircle (\u2022): Ni = 0; Diamond (\u0007): Ni = 0.05Ne ; Square (\u0004):\nNi = 0.1Ne ; Up triangle (N): Ni = 0.2Ne . The lines are\nplotted for the aid of eyes.\n\nTo further reveal the contribution of the impurity to\nthe dephasing under different conditions, we plot the\nSDT as a function of the polarization for different impurity levels at T = 120 K in Fig. 2. The figure clearly\nshows that the impurity tends to remove the anomalous\npeak and to shift the peak to the larger initial spin polarization. This is because that the impurity reduces the\nHF term and therefore the resonance effect is also reduced. Hence, in order to reach the maximum resonance,\none has to increase the initial spin polarization. Consequently, the peak shifts to larger P . Whereas when Ni\nis raised to 0.2Ne , the HF term is reduced too much to\nform a peak.\n\n\f5\nB.\n\nThe temperature dependence of the spin\ndephasing time\n\nAbove we discussed the dependence of spin dephasing on initial spin polarization for different temperatures.\nNow we turn to the temperature dependence of the SDT\nunder different initial spin polarizations. \u00bfFrom Fig. 1(a)\nand (b) in Sec. III(B), one can see that for small polarization, the SDT increases with the temperature. Whereas\nin high polarized region, the SDT decreases with the\ntemperature. For moderate polarization, the temperature dependence is too complicated to be described by a\nmonotonic function of temperature.\nTo see more detail of how the spin dephasing depends\non the temperature, we replot the SDT shown in Fig. 1\nas a function of the temperature for different impurity\nlevels and different spin polarizations in Fig. 3(a) and\n(b). It is seen from the figure that similar to the case of\nGaAs where the DP term is composed of the Dresselhaus\nterm,33 for Rashba term and for low spin polarization the\nSDT also increases with the temperature for all impurity\nlevels. This property is again opposite to the results of\nearlier simplified treatments of the DP effect, where it\nwas predicted that the spin lifetime decreases with the\nincrease of temperature in the 2D system.43,44 The SDT\nbased on the simplified model is given by27,43,45\nR\u221e\n\u0001\ndEk fk 21 \u2212 fk\u2212 12 \u0393(k)\n1\n0\n\u0001 ,\n(9)\n= R\u221e\n\u03c4\ndEk fk 12 \u2212 fk\u2212 12\n0\n\nearlier simplified treatment of the DP mechanism gives\nmuch slower spin dephasing. Although there is no experiment results for InAs, we have shown that for GaAs the\nprediction of our many-body theory agrees both quantitatively and qualitatively with the experiment results.33\n\nin which\n\n\u0393(k) = 2\u03c41 (k)(\u03b10 Ek)2\n\n(10)\n\nand\n\u03c4n\u22121 (k)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n0\n\n\u03c3(Ek , \u03b8)[1 \u2212 cos(n\u03b8)]d\u03b8 .\n\n(11)\n\n\u03c3(Ek , \u03b8) stands for scattering cross-section. For comparison, we plot the SDT predicated by the earlier model and\nby our present many-body theory in the inset of Fig. 3(a).\n\u00bfFrom the inset one can see that the SDT predicated by\nthe earlier model is about one order of magnitude larger\nthan the one predicated by our theory. In the mean time,\nthe SDT of the earlier mode drops dramatically with the\nincrease of the temperature. Nevertheless, in our manybody treatment, it rises slightly with the temperature.\nThe giant difference between two models lies on the\nfact that the earlier simplified model is based on the\nsingle particle picture which does not count for the dephasing due to the inhomogeneous broadening inherited in the Rashba term, which is exactly the result of\nmany body effect.24,25,26,27,28 By comparing the theoretical SDT predicated by the two models, we can see that\nthe spin dephasing due to the inhomogeneous broadening is much more important. In the case we calculated,\nthe spin dephasing is dominated by the inhomogeneous\nbroadening. Therefore, it is easy to understand why the\n\nFIG. 3: Spin dephasing time \u03c4 versus the temperature T for\nInAs QW's with spin polarization P = 2.5 % (a) and P =\n75 % (b) under two different impurity levels. Circle (\u2022): Ni =\n0; Diamond (\u0007): Ni = 0.1Ne . The lines are plotted for the\naid of eyes. The SDT predicated by the simplified treatment\nof DP term (solid curve) and our model (circle) for Ni = 0 is\nplotted in the inset of (a) for comparison.\n\nThe temperature dependence of the SDT can be easily\nunderstood when the spin dephasing due to inhomoge-\n\n\f6\nneous broadening is taken into account: When the temperature increases, the inhomogeneous broadening is reduced as the electrons are distributed to the wider kstates. As a result, the number of electron occupation\non each k state is reduced. It is further noted that this\nreduction is mild as function of the temperature. Therefore, the temperature dependence is quit mild unless it\nis within the regime of anomalous peak.\nIn the region where HF term is important, in addition\nto the above mentioned two effects of the temperature\nacting on the spin dephasing, the temperature dependence of HF term should also be taken into account when\nwe study the temperature dependence of the spin dephasing. In high spin polarization region, the SDT decreases\nwith the temperature. However, in the moderately polarized region, the temperature dependence of SDT due to\nthe combination of these three effects is too complicate\nto be described by a monotonic function. We replot the\nSDT as a function of the temperature in Fig. 3(b), for the\nhigh polarization P = 75 %, which is near the anomalous\npeak shown in Fig. 1(a). We can see that due to the reduction of the HF term, the resonance is removed and the\nSDT drops dramatically with the increase of the temperature in the impurities free sample. While for the system\nwith impurity concentration Ni = 0.1Ne , the HF term is\nless important than that in the impurities free sample,\nand the SDT is less sensitive to the temperature.\n\nC.\n\nMagnetic field dependence of the spin dephasing\n\nWe now investigate the magnetic field dependence of\nthe spin dephasing. In Fig. 4, we plot the SDT versus\nthe applied magnetic field for different impurity levels\nand different spin polarizations. It is seen that for all\nthe cases we study, the SDT increases with the magnetic\nfield. This is because in the presence of a magnetic field,\nthe electron spins undergo a Larmor precession around\nthe magnetic field. This precession suppresses the precession about the effective magnetic field h(k).18,29 Therefore the SDT increases with the magnetic field. It is\npointed out that in 3D electron gas, the magnetic field\nalso forces electrons to precess around it. This precession introduces additional symmetry in the momentum\nspace that limits the k-space available to the DP effect\nwhich is anisotropic in it.18,24,29 This can further reduce\nthe spin dephasing. However, it is expected that this effect in the 2D case is less effective than the 3D case as\nin z-direction the momentum is quantized and the momentum precession around the magnetic field should be\nsuppressed.\nIn additional to the above mentioned effect of the magnetic field on spin dephasing, one can further see from\nFig. 4, that for large polarization, the magnetic field also\nenhances the HF term. As we mentioned before, for large\npolarization, the contribution from the HF term is important. Increase of the HF term serves as additional\nmagnetic field which further suppresses the effect of the\nDP term h(k), and therefore results in a faster rise in\nthe \u03c4 -B curve in the region of B < 4 T. When the applied magnetic field exceeds 4 T, the increase of HF term\nsaturates, thus the slop of the \u03c4 -B curves in the region\nof B > 4 T is reduced to that in the low polarization\nregion. To reveal more concrete about the combining\neffect of the magnetic field and the HF term on spin dephasing, we plot the SDT as a function of polarization\nin Fig. 5. It is shown that the rise in the \u03c4 -P curve\nincreases with the magnetic field. Moreover, the position of the peak in \u03c4 -P shifts to a larger polarization.\nThis is understood that, it needs a larger HF term, and\nhence a larger spin polarization, to achieve the resonance\ncondition when the magnetic field increases. When the\nmagnetic field is raised to 4 T, it is no longer possible\nto form the resonance for all of the polarization. As a\nresult the SDT increases uniquely with the polarization\nand there is no peak in the \u03c4 -P curve.\n\nD.\nFIG. 4: Spin dephasing time \u03c4 versus the applied magnetic\nfield for InAs QW's for different spin polarizations and different impurity levels.

In Fig. 6 we plot the SDT as\na function of the initial spin polarization for three different interface electric fields. It can be seen from the figure that when the interface electric field decreases from\n2 \u00d7 104 V/cm to 5 \u00d7 103 V/cm, the SDT increases about\n\n\f7\n\nFIG. 5: Spin dephasing time \u03c4 versus the polarization for\nInAs QW's at different magnetic field. Circle (\u2022): B=1.5 T;\nDiamond (\u0007): B=2 T; Square (\u0004): B=4 T. The lines are\nplotted for the aid of eyes.\n\n16 folds. It is understood that when the interface electric field increases, the Rashba effect is enhanced, and\nconsequently the spin dephasing is also enhanced. Moreover, for fixed initial spin polarization, the HF term is\nreduced when Ez is increased. As a result, the interface\nelectric field Ez also changes the anomalous peak in the\n\u03c4 -P curve as in order to achieve the resonance condition,\none has to go to higher polarization in order to get large\nenough HF term. Consequently the resonance peak is\nsmoothed and the position moves to higher initial spin\npolarization region when Ez increases, which is shown in\nthe Fig. 6.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn conclusion, we have performed a systematic investigation of the Rashba effect on the spin dephasing\nof n-typed InAs QW's under moderate magnetic fields\nin Voigt configuration. Based on the nonequilibrium\nGreen's function theory, we derived a set of kinetic Bloch\nequations for a two-spin-band model. This model includes the electron-phonon, electron-impurity scattering\nas well as the electron-electron interaction. By numerically solving the kinetic Bloch equations, we study the\ntime evolution of electron densities in each spin band\nand the spin coherence \u2013 the correlation between spin-up\nand -down bands. The spin dephasing time is calculated\nfrom the slope of the envelope of the time evolution of\nthe incoherently summed spin coherence. We therefore\n\nFIG. 6: Spin dephasing time \u03c4 versus the initial spin polarization at T = 120 K, B = 1.5 T, Ni = 0 for three different\ninterface electric fields.\n\nare able to study in detail how this dephasing time is affected by spin polarization, temperature, impurity level,\nmagnetic field and interface electric field. Differing from\nthe earlier studies on spin dephasing based on the single\nparticle model which only considers the effective SF scattering, our theory also takes account of the contribution\nof many-body effect on the spin dephasing.24,25,26,27,28 In\nfact, for the n-typed semiconductors and the spin polarization studied in the experiments, this many-body dephasing effect is even more important than the effective\nSF scattering as it is one order of magnitude larger than\nthe later. Equally remarkable is that, as we include all\nthe scattering, especially the Coulomb scattering in our\nmany-body theory, now we are able to calculate the spin\ndephasing with extra large (up to 100 %) initial spin polarization which is unable to be calculated by the former\nsingle particle theory.\nIt is discovered that the SDT increases with the initial spin polarization. Moreover, for low impurity level\nand low temperature, there is a giant anomalous resonant\npeak in the curve of the SDT versus the initial spin polarization. This resonant peak moves to high spin polarization and its magnitude is fast reduced (enhanced) until\nthe whole resonance disappears if one increases the impurity density, the temperature and/or the interface electric field (the magnetic field). It is discovered that this\nanomalous resonance peak originates from the HF contribution of the electron-electron Coulomb interaction. Under the right spin polarization, the contribution of HF\nterm may reach the magnitude comparable to the contribution of the DP term as well as the magnetic field in\nthe coherent part of the Bloch equation and reduces the\n\n\f8\nanisotropy caused by the Rashba effect-consequently reduces the spin dephasing. As the resonance is the combined effects of the HF term, the Rashba term and the\nmagnetic field, the magnitude and position of the resonance peak are affected by all the factors that can alert\nthe magnitude of the HF term, such as temperature, impurity scattering, magnetic field as well as the interface\nelectric field: For a given impurity concentration, when\nthe temperature increases, the HF term reduces. Consequently the \u03c4 -P curve is smoothed and the peak position\nis moved to higher spin polarization; For impurity free\nsample, if the temperature is raised to 200 K, the HF\nterm is reduced too much to form a resonance and the\nanomalous peak disappears; The same situation happens\nwhen the impurity level increases at a given temperature\nas the scattering also lowers the HF term. When the impurity level is raised to 0.2Ne there is no resonance in\nthe temperature region we studied; While the increase\nof the magnetic field enhances the HF term and results\nin a faster increase of the SDT as well as a higher resonant peak in \u03c4 -P curve. Moreover, as the magnetic field\nbecomes larger, it needs a larger HF term and hence a\nlarger polarization in order to achieve the resonant condition. Therefore the peak position is also moved to higher\npolarization; When the interface electric field increases,\nthe HF term is reduced. Therefore the resonance peak\nin \u03c4 -P becomes flatter and its position moves to higher\nspin polarization.\nFor low spin polarized regime, the SDT increases when\nthe temperature rises. This is contrary to the result\nof earlier simplified single-particle calculation where the\nSDT always decreases with the increase of the temperature. Moreover, the SDT predicted by our many-body\ncalculation is one order of magnitude faster than the earlier result. The physics of this feature is due to the additional many-body spin dephasing channel due to the inhomogeneous broadening provided by the Rashba term,\nwhich by combining with the SC scattering also causes\nspin dephasing. In the situation we studied, the spin dephasing is dominated by the many-body dephasing effect.\nWith the increase of the temperature, the inhomogeneous\nbroadening reduces and the SDT increases.\nIn high spin polarization region, the contribution of\n\nthe HF term should be taken into consideration. This\nbrings more complication in the study of the spin dephasing. Usually the SDT can not be described by a\nmonotonic function of the temperature and the impurity concentration in high polarization regime. For polarization near the resonance peak in low temperature\nand impurities free samples, the SDT decreases dramatically with the temperature as the resonance is removed\nwhen the temperature increases. Whereas when the impurity concentration is 0.1Ne , the SDT is less sensitive\nto the temperature.\nAs the magnetic field causes the electron spins to precess about it, this precession will suppress the precession\nabout the effective magnetic field h(k) originated from\nthe Rashba effect. As a result the spin dephasing is reduced. The magnetic field also enhances the HF term,\nwhich servers as an additional magnetic field and further suppresses the Rashba effect. Therefore, the \u03c4 -B\ncurve gets a faster increase in the high polarization region. Our calculation also shows that when the interface\nelectric field increases, the SDT decreases. This is because with the increasing of the interface electric field,\nthe Rashba term is strengthened.\nIn summary we have performed a thorough investigation of the spin dephasing in n-typed InAs QW's. Many\nnew features which have not been investigated both theoretically and experimentally are predicted in a wide range\nof parameters.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nMWW is supported by the \"100 Person Project\" of\nChinese Academy of Sciences and Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 10247002.
