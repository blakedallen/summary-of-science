Several quasars presented in this paper\nexhibit interesting properties, including a radio-loud quasar at z = 4.77, and a\nnarrow-line quasar (FWHM = 1500 km s\u22121 ) at z = 3.57.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis paper is the third in a series presenting high-redshift (z > 3.6) quasars selected\nfrom the commissioning data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000). In\nPapers I and II (Fan et al. 1999a, 2000a) in this series, and in Schneider et al. (2000a, b,\n2001), we have presented the discovery of \u223c 60 quasars at z >\n\u223c 3.6, selected from \u2248 400\n2\ndeg of SDSS multicolor imaging data along the Celestial Equator. In this paper, we\ndescribe observations of additional quasar candidates selected in a similar manner in the\nFall Equatorial Stripe, overlapping the areas covered by Fan et al. (1999a) and Schneider\net al. (2000b), together defining a complete color-selected sample of bright high-redshift\nquasars covering 182 deg2 . In addition, we search for fainter high-redshift quasars based on\nareas of the sky that have been imaged twice by the SDSS.\nIn \u00a72, we describe the photometric observations and quasar candidate selection. In\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n\u00a73, we present the photometry and the spectroscopic observations of 14 newly discovered\n\u2217\nquasars in the Fall Equatorial Stripe at z >\n\u223c 3.6 and i <\n\u223c 20, plus the observations of two\npreviously known quasars in the same area of the sky. In this section, we also develop\na method of using the measurements of emission line equivalent widths and broad-band\nmulticolor photometry to estimate the slope of the intrinsic power-law continuum. In \u00a74, we\npresent the final flux-limited color-selected high-redshift quasar sample, which consists of\n2\n39 quasars at i\u2217 <\n\u223c 20 and 3.6 < z < 5.0 and covering 182 deg . The selection completeness\nof this sample is calculated in \u00a75, based on a Monte-Carlo simulation of quasar colors\nas a function of redshift, using the quasar spectral model of Fan (1999). The effects of\nredshift, luminosity, continuum shape and emission line strength on the completeness of the\nsurvey are discussed in detail in \u00a75. The results are summarized in \u00a76. This color-selected\nsample is used to study the evolution of the quasar luminosity function at high redshift in\na subsequent paper (Paper IV, Fan et al. 2000b).\nIn Appendix A, we provide updated information on the SDSS filter response functions,\nwhich are used to calculate quasar model colors and the selection function. Part of the\nFall Equatorial Stripe area has been imaged multiple times during the commissioning\nphase, allowing a search for quasars fainter than i\u2217 \u223c 20. In Appendix B, we present the\nphotometry and spectroscopy of 18 faint quasars discovered from these data. They do not\nyet form a complete sample with well-defined selection criteria.\n\n2.\n\nPhotometric Observations and Quasar Selection\n\nThe SDSS telescope (Siegmund et al. 2000), imaging camera (Gunn et al. 1998), and\nphotometric data reduction (Lupton et al. 2000) are described in York et al. (2000) (see\nalso Paper I). Briefly, the telescope, located at Apache Point Observatory in southeastern\nNew Mexico, has a 2.5m primary mirror and a wide, essentially distortion-free field. The\nimaging camera contains thirty 2048 \u00d7 2048 photometric CCDs, which simultaneously\nobserve 6 parallel 13\u2032 wide swaths, or scanlines of the sky, in 5 broad filters (u\u2032 , g \u2032, r \u2032 , i\u2032 , and\nz \u2032 ) covering the entire optical band from the atmospheric cutoff in the blue to the silicon\nsensitivity cutoff in the red (Fukugita et al. 1996, see also Appendix A). The photometric\ndata are taken in time-delay and integrate (TDI, or \"drift-scan\") mode at sidereal rate;\na given point on the sky passes through each of the five filters in succession. The total\nintegration time per filter is 54.1 seconds. The data were calibrated photometrically by\nobserving secondary standards in the survey area using a 50cm telescope at Apache Point\nObservatory. The SDSS primary standard star network had not yet been finalized at the\ntime of these observations, so the photometric calibration used in this paper is only accurate\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nto \u223c 10%, 2%, 2%, 2% and 7%, in the u\u2032 , g \u2032 , r \u2032 , i\u2032 , and z \u2032 bands, respectively. Thus as in\nPapers I and II, we will denote the preliminary SDSS magnitudes presented here as u\u2217 , g \u2217,\nr \u2217 , i\u2217 and z \u2217 , rather than the notation u\u2032 , g \u2032 , r \u2032 , i\u2032 and z \u2032 that will be used for the final\nSDSS photometry, which will have photometric accuracy of <\n\u223c 2% for bright sources.\nIn this paper, we select bright (i\u2217 <\n\u223c 20) high-redshift quasar candidates from two SDSS\nimaging runs (Run 94 and 125, see Table B1) in the Fall Equatorial Stripe at high Galactic\nh\nm\nlatitude (22h 20m <\n\u223c \u03b12000 <\n\u223c 4 30 ). These two runs form a filled stripe 2.5 degrees wide in\ndeclination, centered on the Celestial Equator. Some quasars found from these two runs\nhave already been presented in Paper I and in Schneider et al. (2000b). The photometric\ndata reduction procedures are described in Paper I. In this paper, we use the photometric\ncatalogs produced by the most recent version of the SDSS photometric pipeline, which now\ncorrects for the time and spatial variation of the Point Spread Function (PSF) within a\ngiven 10\u2032 \u00d7 13\u2032 CCD frame, improving both the photometric accuracy and the star-galaxy\nseparation. The 5-\u03c3 limiting magnitudes are similar to those of Papers I and II, roughly\n22.3, 22.6, 22.7, 22.4 and 20.5 in u\u2217 , g \u2217 , r \u2217 , i\u2217 , and z \u2217 , respectively, for a single observation.\nThe photometry from the new reduction has changed slightly from the those in Paper I,\nbut the differences are almost always smaller than the quoted photometric errors. Figure 1\npresents the color-color diagrams for all stellar sources at i\u2217 < 20.2 in 25 deg2 of the SDSS\nimaging data. The inner parts of the diagrams are shown as contours, linearly spaced in\ndensity of stars per unit area on the color-color diagram. As in Papers I and II, only sources\nthat are detected in all three relevant bands at more than 5 \u03c3 are plotted. The median\ntracks of quasar colors as a function of redshift from Fan (1999) are also displayed in Figure\n1.\nHigh-redshift quasar candidates were selected using color cuts similar to those presented\nin Papers I and II. The final criteria we use to define the color-selected complete sample in\n\u00a74 are based on the colors after correcting for Galactic extinction using the reddening map\nof Schlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis (1998). The criteria are as follows:\n1. gri candidates, selected principally from the g \u2217 \u2212 r \u2217 , r \u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 diagram:\n(a) i\u2217 < 20.05\n(b) u\u2217 \u2212 g \u2217 > 2.00 or u\u2217 > 21.00\n(c) g \u2217 \u2212 r \u2217 > 1.00\n(d) r \u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 < 0.42(g \u2217 \u2212 r \u2217 ) \u2212 0.31 or g \u2217 \u2212 r \u2217 > 2.30\n(e) i\u2217 \u2212 z \u2217 < 0.25\n2. riz candidates, selected principally from the r \u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 , i\u2217 \u2212 z \u2217 diagram:\n\n(1)\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n\n(a) i\u2217 < 20.20\n(b) u\u2217 > 22.00\n(c) g \u2217 > 22.60\n(d) r \u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 > 1.00\n(e) i\u2217 \u2212 z \u2217 < 0.47(r \u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 ) \u2212 0.48\n\n(2)\n\nThe intersections of those color cuts with the g \u2217 \u2212 r \u2217 , r \u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 and r \u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 , i\u2217 \u2212 z \u2217\ndiagrams are illustrated in Figure 1. The final criteria are more restrictive than those\nused in Papers I and II, in the sense that the cuts are further away from the stellar locus.\nBecause of the limited observing time for spectroscopic follow-up observations, we used this\ntighter cut to limit the number of contaminants among the candidates in order to complete\nthe sample in the Fall 1999 observing season. This modification increases the observing\nefficiency at the cost of lower selection completeness. The completeness function of the\ncolor selection criteria, and the effects of different selection constraints on the sample are\npresented in \u00a75. In the SDSS main spectroscopic survey, the quasar candidates are selected\nin multi-dimensional color space using a more complicated algorithm (Newberg et al. 2000,\nin preparation, see also Newberg & Yanny 1997).\nPaper I presented the photometry of two previously known quasars from Run 94 data.\nIn Run 125 (in an area not covered by Paper I), two additional quasars are recovered. SDSSp\nJ005922.65+000301.419 is reported in Kennefick, Djorgovski & de Carvalho (1995) as PSS\n0059+0003 (z = 4.16). No information on the other quasar, SDSSp J024457.19\u2013010809.9,\nhas been published in the literature, but it is reported at the DPOSS website20 as PSS\n0244\u20130108. We obtained its spectrum in order to measure its spectral properties.\n\n3.\n\nSpectroscopic Observations\n\nThirty-three quasar candidates that meet the criteria described in \u00a72 were observed in\nthe Fall 1999 observing season using the Keck II telescope and the Hobby-Eberly Telescope\n(HET). Twenty-five of the candidates are identified as high-redshift quasars at z > 3.6.\nThe HET observations of 11 new quasars are presented in a separate paper (Schneider et\nal. 2000b). Here we present the Keck observations.\n19\n\nThe naming convention for the SDSS sources is SDSSp JHHMMSS.SS\u00b1DDMMSS.S, where \"p\" stands\nfor the preliminary SDSS astrometry, and the positions are expressed in J2000.0 coordinates. The astrometry\nis accurate to better than 0.2\u2032\u2032 in each axis.\n20\n\nhttp://astro.caltech.edu/\u223cgeorge/z4.qso\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nSpectra of 12 SDSS high-redshift quasars were taken with the Keck II telescope,\nusing the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS, Oke et al. 1995) on the nights\nof 1999 October 15 and 16. A 300 line mm\u22121 grating was used. Two quasars (SDSSp\nJ012700.69\u2212004559.1 and SDSSp J021043.17\u2212001818.4) were observed with Keck II/LRIS\non 1999 July 21, when a 400 line mm\u22121 grating was used. The exposure times ranged from\n600 s to 1200 s. Observations of the spectrophotometric standard Feige 110 (Massey 1988,\nMassey & Gronwall 1990) were used to provide flux calibrations and to correct for telluric\nabsorption, and observations of Hg-Ne-Ar lamps were used for wavelength calibration. The\nspectra were reduced with standard IRAF procedures. The calibrated spectra extend from\n4000 \u00c5 to 9000 \u00c5 for the 300 line mm\u22121 grating spectra, with a dispersion of 2.4 \u00c5/pixel.\nNote that at 8000 \u00c5< \u03bb < 9000 \u00c5, the spectrum is slightly affected by second-order\ncontamination from 4000 < \u03bb < 4500 \u00c5. However, there is little flux at at \u03bb < 4500\u00c5 for\nhigh-redshift quasars due to the absorption systems, and we did not notice any order-overlap\neffect in the data. The second-order effect, however, does somewhat affect the standard\nstar observation, the flux calibration, and the removal of the telluric bands. The spectral\ncoverage is 4000 \u00c5 to 8000 \u00c5 for the 400 line mm\u22121 grating spectra, with a dispersion of\n1.9 \u00c5/pixel. The resolution of the LRIS spectra is \u223c 7 \u00c5. In addition, spectra of SDSSp\nJ024457.19\u2013010809.9 (PSS 0244\u20130108) were obtained with the ARC 3.5m telescope using\nthe Double Imaging Spectrograph (DIS) on the night of 1999 December 28 for a total\nexposure time of 2400 s. The DIS instrument and spectral data reduction procedures were\ndescribed in Paper I.\nTable 1 gives the positions, SDSS photometry and redshifts of the 14 new SDSS\nhigh-redshift quasars, and the photometric run from which they were selected, as well as\nthe SDSS measurements of the two previously-known quasars. The photometry is expressed\nin asinh magnitudes (Lupton, Gunn & Szalay 1999, see also Paper I). The photometric\nerrors given are only statistical, and do not include calibration errors. Note that all but\none objects presented in this paper are selected from Run 125. Most of the candidates\nfrom Run 94 are presented in Paper I and in Schneider et al. (2000b). Positions of the 16\nconfirmed SDSS quasars presented in this paper are plotted on the color-color diagrams\n(Figure 1a and 1c) as filled circles. Positions of other quasars in the same survey area and\nnon-quasars that satisfied the selection criteria are also shown in Figure 1. Finding charts\nof all objects in Table 1 are given in Figure 2. They are 160\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 160\u2032\u2032 i\u2032 band SDSS images\nwith an effective exposure time of 54.1 seconds.\nWe matched the positions of quasars in Table 2 against the FIRST radio survey\n(Becker, White, & Helfand 1995). Three of them have FIRST counterparts at 20 cm at\nthe 1 mJy level (with positional matches better than 1\u2032\u2032 ): SDSSp J013108.19+005248.2\n(z = 4.19), SDSSp J021043.17\u2013001818.4 (z = 4.77) and SDSSp J030025.23+003224.2\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n(z = 4.19), correspond to unresolved FIRST sources of 4.00, 9.75 and 7.56 mJy at 20 cm,\nrespectively. In particular, SDSSp J021043.17\u2013001818.4 (z = 4.77) is the highest redshift\nradio-loud luminous quasar yet known. None of the objects was detected in the ROSAT\nfull-sky pixel images (Voges et al. 1999) at a typical 3\u03c3 upper limit of 3 \u00d7 10\u221213 erg s\u22121\ncm\u22122 in the 0.1 \u2013 2.4 keV band.\nFigure 3 presents the spectra of the 14 newly discovered SDSS quasars and of SDSSp\nJ024457.19\u2013010809.9 (PSS 0244\u20130108). In the figure, we place the spectra on an absolute\nflux scale (to compensate for the uncertainties due to non-photometric conditions and\nvariable seeing during the night) by forcing the synthetic i\u2217 magnitudes from the spectra to\nbe the same as the SDSS photometric measurements. The emission line properties of the\nquasars are listed in Table 2. Central wavelengths and rest frame equivalent widths of five\nmajor emission lines are measured following the procedures of Paper I.\n\n3.1.\n\nDetermination of Continuum Properties\n\nWe assume the quasar continuum is a power law with a slope \u03b1: f\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b1 (or\nf\u03bb \u221d \u03bb\u2212\u03b1\u22122 ). The continuum magnitude, AB1450 , is defined as the AB magnitude at\n\u03bb = 1450 \u00c5 in the rest frame corrected for Galactic extinction. AB magnitude can be\nconverted to flux units as:\nAB\u03bd = \u22122.5 log f\u03bd \u2212 48.60,\n(3)\nwhere f\u03bd has units of erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 Hz\u22121 . For a power law continuum, AB1450 can be\nconverted to the rest-frame Kron-Cousins B band magnitude:\nB = AB1450 + 2.5\u03b1 log(4400/1450) + 0.12.\n\n(4)\n\nThe effective wavelength in the B band is 4400 \u00c5, and the factor 0.12 is the zeropoint\ndifference between the AB magnitude system and the Vega-based system in the B band\n(Schmidt, Schneider & Gunn 1995).\nTable 3 gives the continuum properties of the quasars. As in Paper I, redshifts are\ndetermined from all emission lines redward of Ly\u03b1; Ly\u03b1 itself is not used, due to absorption\nfrom the Ly\u03b1 forest on its blue side. The parameters \u03b1 and AB1450 can be determined from\nthe spectrum alone. However, not all our observations were carried out under photometric\nconditions or with the slit at the parallactic angle. The observed continuum range redward\nof the Ly\u03b1 emission covered by the spectra (1216(1 + z) \u00c5 to 9000 \u00c5) of these high-redshift\nquasars is typically only few hundred \u00c5 in the rest frame. Moreover, some of the spectra\nhave rather poor signal-to-noise ratio beyond 8000 \u00c5. Thus, in some cases, it is difficult to\ndetermine accurately the continuum slope \u03b1 from the observed spectrum.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nHowever, the broad-band photometry gives us an alternative method to determine the\nslope. The intrinsic quasar spectrum can be modeled as a power-law continuum plus a\nseries of emission lines. The equivalent width of the lines can be measured quite accurately\nfrom the spectrum. Therefore, the slope of the power-law can be determined by matching\nthe spectral model to the broad-band photometry. The SDSS z \u2032 cutoff is beyond 10,000 \u00c5,\nso this gives a broader baseline over which to determine the slope. Moreover, the absolute\nphotometric calibration is more accurate. The contribution to the broad-band colors from\nemission lines other than Ly\u03b1 is also small. However, only bands which are not affected\nby Ly\u03b1 forest lines can be used in this method. At z > 4.5, Ly\u03b1 moves into the i\u2032 band,\nmaking it impossible to determine the slope from the z \u2032 measurement alone. Therefore, we\ndevelop a method to fit the continuum slope \u03b1 and to derive AB1450 of the quasar using\ninformation from both the observed spectrum and the broad-band photometry. Briefly,\nwe construct a quasar spectral model that uses the observed spectrum blueward of Ly\u03b1\nemission and the power-law continuum plus emission line model redward of Ly\u03b1 emission,\nand determine \u03b1 and AB1450 by finding the model that fits the photometry the best. In\ndetail, the method consists of following steps:\n(1) Obtain a corrected observed spectrum f\u03bbobs that matches the SDSS\nphotometry. For quasars with i\u2217 < 20 and z < 4.3, the photometric errors in the r \u2032 and\ni\u2032 bands are small (< 0.04 mag). We apply an additional correction function linear in\nwavelength (with two free parameters, a zeropoint and a slope) to the spectrum so that the\nsynthetic photometry reproduces the SDSS r \u2217 and i\u2217 magnitudes. For objects at z > 4.3,\nthe Ly\u03b1 forest moves into r \u2032 , increasing the error in the r \u2032 band, therefore we only apply a\nzeropoint shift to match the i\u2217 magnitude.\n(2) For a given \u03b1 and AB1450 , construct a model spectrum f\u03bbmodel :\nf\u03bbmodel\n\n=\n\n(\n\nf\u03bbobs\nif \u03bb < 1260 \u00c5\u00d7(1 + z),\ni\n\u2212\u03b1\u22122 P\nf1450 [\u03bb/1450(1 + z)]\n* i [1 + EWi P (\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 )] if \u03bb > 1260 \u00c5\u00d7(1 + z).\n\n(5)\n\nFor \u03bb < 1260 \u00d7 (1 + z), we use the flux from the corrected observed spectrum f\u03bbobs . The\nobserved profile for the Ly\u03b1+N V emission line is used as the line is strongly affected by the\nLy\u03b1 forest absorption. For \u03bb > 1260 \u00d7 (1 + z), the model spectrum has three components:\n(a) a power law continuum with f\u03bb \u221d \u03bb\u2212\u03b1\u22122 and continuum magnitude AB1450 ;\n(b) emission lines. We use the equivalent widths measured in Table 2 for strong lines.\nFor weak lines, we use the line ratios in Francis et al. (1991) to scale from the measured\nLy\u03b1+N V emission line strength. The line profile P (\u03bb) is assumed to be a Gaussian with\nFWHM of 5000 km s\u22121 . The choice of FWHM has negligible effect on the broad-band\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\ncolors;\n(c) if there is any broad absorption or strong associated absorption system in the\nspectrum, the equivalent widths and FWHMs are measured and the lines are added to the\nspectrum.\n(3) Obtain the best fit \u03b1 and AB1450 . First, for a given (\u03b1, AB1450 ), the synthetic\nSDSS magnitudes mmodel are calculated from the model spectrum. We add the statistical\nerror in Table 1 and the calibration error (\u00a72) of the SDSS photometry in quadrature to\nobtain the final photometric error \u03c3iobs . Then we minimize the total \u03c72 of the differences\nbetween the synthetic magnitudes and the SDSS photometry mobs with respect to \u03b1 and\nAB1450 :\n!\nmodel\nobs 2\nX\nm\n\u2212\nm\ni\ni\n\u03c72 =\n.\n(6)\nobs\n\u03c3\ni\ni\n\nFor quasars at z < 4.3, \u03bb = 1260 \u00d7 (1 + z) is still inside the SDSS r \u2032 band, while the u\u2032\nand g \u2032 bands are dominated by the absorption systems. Therefore, r \u2217 , i\u2217 and z \u2217 magnitudes\nare used. For quasars at z > 4.3, only i\u2217 and z \u2217 magnitudes can provide useful constraints\non the continuum slope, and only these bands are used in the fit. The 1-\u03c3 errors on the\nparameters are estimated by finding the values that give \u03c72 = \u03c72min + 1, where \u03c72min is for\nthe best-fit parameters. The error on \u03b1 is \u223c 0.20 for z < 4.3 and \u223c 0.5 for z > 4.3, and\nthe error on AB1450 is typically a few percent. The best-fit values and 1-\u03c3 errors of \u03b1 and\nAB1450 are given in Table 3. An example of the result of this fitting procedure is shown in\nFigure 4.\n\nThe major reason for determining \u03b1 in this paper is to estimate the selection\ncompleteness of the survey, as the selection probability varies with different continuum\nshape (and therefore different broad-band colors). For objects with high signal-to-noise\nratio spectra, the \u03b1 values determined from the spectra and from the method above are\nusually consistent with each other within the quoted error. Determining \u03b1 using broad-band\nphotometry does not depend on the selection of a continuum window, and the error bar is\neasy to interpret. The best-fit \u03b1 using the method above always minimizes the difference\nbetween model and observed colors. By tying to the observed colors rather than fitting\nthe observed spectra, the effect of photometric calibration errors (at 2% \u2013 7% level in this\npaper) on the selection completeness calculation is minimized: an error on the photometric\ncalibration or uncertainties in the filter response would give rise to a wrong best-fit \u03b1, but\nto first order, the spectral model in \u00a75 based on these \u03b1 values should still reproduce the\nobserved color distribution.\nFor the survey selection function (\u00a75) and the quasar luminosity function (Paper IV),\nthe calculations are carried out in two cosmologies: a model with \u03a9m = 1 and H0 = 50 km\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\ns\u22121 km\u22121 , where we refer to as the \u03a9 = 1 model hereafter; and a \u039b-dominated flat model\nwith \u03a9m = 0.35, \u039b = 0.65 and H0 = 65 km s\u22121 km\u22121 , which we refer to as the \u039b-model\nhereafter. In this paper, most of the results are presented using the \u03a9 = 1 model. Table 3\ngives the absolute magnitude at 1450 \u00c5 in the rest frame, M1450 , for the \u03a9 = 1 model. In\nPaper IV, we use the M1450 values to derive the quasar luminosity function, and compare\nwith low-redshift results after converting to the rest-frame B-band. All the continuum\nproperties of Table 3 have been corrected for Galactic extinction using the reddening map\nof Schlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis (1998) assuming a standard extinction curve.\n\n3.2.\n\nNotes on Individual Objects\n\nSDSSp J012700.69\u2013004559.1 (z = 4.06). A prominent damped Ly\u03b1 absorption line\ncandidate is detected at \u03bb = 5742 \u00c5 (zabs = 3.72), with a rest-frame equivalent width of 33\n\u00c5. The corresponding metal line systems (the C IV doublet at 7330/7317 \u00c5, and the Si IV\ndoublet at 6632/6589 \u00c5) are also detected.\nSDSSp J021043.17\u2013001818.4 (z = 4.77). This is the highest redshift radio loud quasar\nknown to date, and is located only 10.4\u2032 away from SDSSp J021102.72\u2013000910.3 (z = 4.90).\nThe co-moving separation of the two quasars is 29.7 h\u22121 Mpc for \u03a9 = 1.\nSDSSp J024457.19\u2013010809.9 (z = 3.96). This is the previously-known quasar PSS\n0244\u20130108, which has a reported redshift of z = 4.01 on the DPOSS website 21 . It is a BAL\nquasar. Strong BAL troughs due to Ly\u03b1+N V and C IV are clearly visible in the spectrum.\nThe C IV BAL trough has a velocity of \u223c 17200 km s\u22121 and FWHM of \u223c 8600 km s\u22121 .\nThe redshift determination is not straightforward for BAL quasars due to the presence of\nstrong absorption features. The redshift reported here is the average of redshifts from the\npeaks of the O I and Si IV emission lines.\nSDSSp J025019.78+004650.3 (z = 4.76). Typically, quasars at z > 4.5 would encounter\na Lyman Limit System within 0.1 of its emission line redshift (Schneider, Schmidt & Gunn\n1991, Paper I). A strong Lyman Limit System (LLS) in this quasar is detected only at\nz = 4.24 (\u03bb \u223c 4780 \u00c5). As a result, this object is detected at the 5-\u03c3 level in the g \u2032 band. If\nwe assume the number density of the LLS N(z) = 0.27(1 + z)1.55 (Storrie-Lombardi & Irwin\n1994), the fraction of quasars at z = 4.76 without a LLS at z > 4.24 is 13%.\nSDSSp J030707.46\u2013001601.4 (z = 3.70). A metal absorption system at z = 3.64 is\ndetected based on the C IV doublet at 7200/7186 \u00c5 and the Si IV doublet at 6514/6471 \u00c5.\n21\n\nhttp://astro.caltech.edu/\u223cgeorge/z4.qso\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nA Mg II system at z = 1.29 is also detected (the doublet at 6430/6414 \u00c5).\n\n4.\n\nThe Fall Equatorial Stripe Sample\n\nUsing the selection criteria presented in \u00a72 (Eq. 1 and 2), we define a complete\ncolor-selected high-redshift quasar sample in the Fall Equatorial Stripe. This complete\nsample covers the area of SDSS Runs 94 and 125. The right ascension of Run 94 ranges\nfrom 22h 22m to 3h 55m . For Run 125, we only include areas with 23h 18m < \u03b12000 < 4h ,\nbecause the reddening increases to E(B \u2212 V ) > 0.2 and becomes patchy at \u03b12000 > 4h\nat the east end of Run 125. After further correcting for (a) the overlap between Run 94\nand 125 (\u223c 7%), (b) small areas of the sky with very poor seeing, and (c) areas on the\nCCDs affected by bright stars and defects which do not allow accurate measurements of\nthe colors, the total effective area of the sample is 181.9 deg2 . During the selection process,\nwe also rejected objects with flags indicating problems with image processing, in most cases\nassociated with deblending of close neighbors (see Lupton 2000), and some objects are\nfurther rejected upon visual inspection of the image. The area covered by such objects is\nnegligible.\nThe final color-selected sample contains 39 quasars at 3.6 < z < 5.0. It includes 14\nquasars presented in Paper I, 11 quasars presented in Schneider et al. (2000b) and 14\nquasars presented in this paper. Figure 1 shows the positions of all the quasars presented\nin these three papers on the color-color diagrams. Several quasars in the same area of the\nsky in these papers are not part of the sample because they do not satisfy the final color\nselection criteria, either due to the tighter selection compared to the criteria in Paper I, or\ndue to slight changes in the photometric zeropoints in the new photometric catalog.\nIn Figures 1(b) and (d), we plot the positions of the 14 non-quasars in the survey\narea that satisfy the selection criteria in the color-color diagrams. Among them, seven are\ngalaxies with redshifts between 0.37 and 0.74. They all have compact morphology and are\nclassified as stellar sources in the photometric catalog. With the exception of one with poor\nsignal-to-noise ratio, all are identified as E+A (or k+A) galaxies showing strong Balmer\nbreak, Balmer absorption lines and weak emission lines (Dressler & Gunn 1982, Poggianti et\nal. 1999). Their broad-band colors are similar to those of high-redshift quasars: the strong\nBalmer break mimics the Lyman break in the quasar spectrum, while the continuum of\nE+A galaxies redward of the Balmer break is also blue, due to the contributions of the A\u2013F\nstars in the galaxy. Five of the non-quasars are stars: one is a faint Carbon star (Margon\net al. 2000, in preparation), while the other four seem to be normal stars scattered out of\nthe stellar locus by photometric errors. We are not able to classify the other two objects.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nOne has very poor signal-to-noise ratio; we will discuss the nature of the other unclassified\nobject in a separate paper (Fan et al. 2000 in preparation). Among the 53 objects that\nsatisfy the final selection criteria, 39 are quasars, giving a success rate of 73%. This is\nhigher than the 63% success rate quoted in Paper I. Several of non-quasars in Paper I no\nlonger satisfy the tighter final selection with improved photometry. Note that most of the\nnon-quasars are very close to the selection boundary.\nIn Table 4, we present the properties of the 39 quasars. The continuum magnitude\nand the continuum slope are calculated following the procedures described in \u00a73.1. For\nquasars in Paper I, these quantities are re-measured based on improved (although not final)\nSDSS photometry. For the three previously known quasars for which we did not obtain\nnew spectra, we use the spectral properties measured in Smith et al. (1994) and Kennefick,\nDjorgovski & de Carvalho (1995) and the SDSS photometry to derive their continuum\nmagnitudes and power-law slopes. Table 4 also lists the detection probability of each\nquasar, which is described in the next section.\nThe sample in Table 4 covers a redshift range of 3.66 \u2264 z \u2264 5.00, and an absolute\nmagnitude range of \u221225.69 \u2264 M1450 \u2264 \u221227.72 for the \u03a9 = 1 model. This is the largest\ncomplete sample of quasars at z > 3.6 to date. It includes 18 quasars at z > 4.0 and six at\nz > 4.5, enabling us to determine the quasar number density at z \u223c 4.8 (Paper IV). By\ncomparison, the Schmidt, Schneider & Gunn (1995) sample has 9 quasars at z > 4.0 with\none at z > 4.5, and the Kennefick, Djorgovski & de Carvalho (1995) sample includes 10\nquasars at z > 4.0 with a highest redshift of 4.45.\nAbout 10% of optically selected low-redshift quasars are BALs (Weymann et al. 1991).\nIn this sample, two of the quasars (SDSSp J023909.98\u2013002121.5 and SDSSp J024457.19\u2013\n010809.9) are classical BAL quasars; two other quasars (SDSSp 015048.83+004126.2 and\nSDSSp 033910.53\u2013003009.2) are candidate mini-BAL quasars. The result is consistent\nwith the fraction found in low-redshift samples. However, some of the spectra have poor\nsignal-to-noise ratio, and we have not yet applied an objective criteria for selecting BALs\nto all the spectra, so this fraction is likely to be a lower limit. At least one object, SDSSp\nJ033829.31+002156.3 (z = 5.00), also shows a strong and broad CIV absorption feature in\na high signal-to-noise ratio spectrum (Songaila et al. 1999).\nSchmidt et al. (1995) and Stern et al. (2000) found that about 10% of known quasars\nat z > 4 (most of which are also color-selected) are detected at radio wavelengths at the\nmJy level. Four quasars in our sample are FIRST radio sources with total flux of 4.0 \u2013 9.8\nmJy at 20cm. Although our sample size is still small, the fraction of radio-loud quasars in\nour sample is consistent with the previous results.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n5.\n\nThe Selection Function of the Color-Selected Sample\n\nTo derive the luminosity function of high-redshift quasars from the color-selected\nsample in Table 4, we first need to calculate the selection function. It is defined as the\nprobability, p(M1450 , z, SED), that a quasar of a given M1450 , z, and spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) will satisfy the color selection criteria (Eqs. 1 and 2), In this section,\nwe calculate the selection function using a Monte-Carlo simulation of quasar colors, based\non the quasar spectral model described in Fan (1999). Similar procedures were adopted to\ncalculate the selection function for multicolor quasar surveys by Warren, Hewett & Osmer\n(1994) and Kennefick, Djorgovski & de Carvalho (1995).\nThe measured colors of a quasar at a certain redshift and luminosity are determined by\nthree factors: its intrinsic SED; the absorption systems that are distributed randomly along\nthe line of sight; and the photometric errors. In \u00a75.1, we describe the quasar spectral model\nand calculate the detection probability p(M1450 , z, SED) of individual quasars, taking into\naccount the effects of the distribution of absorption systems and photometric errors. We\ndiscuss in detail how this probability varies with different parameters, and how the selection\ncriteria affect the sample completeness. In \u00a75.2, we calculate the distribution of the intrinsic\nproperties of quasars, the continuum slopes \u03b1 and equivalent widths of Ly\u03b1+N V emission,\nbased on the sample in Table 4, after correcting for the detection probability calculated in\n\u00a75.1. Finally, in \u00a75.3, we calculate the average selection probability of the quasar sample as\na function of redshift and luminosity.\n\n5.1.\n\nDetection Probability of Individual Quasars\n\nTo determine the detection probability, we first calculate the synthetic distribution of\nquasar colors at a given (M1450 , z, SED), following the procedures described in Fan (1999).\nAs in that paper and in \u00a73.1, the intrinsic quasar spectrum model, including a power law\ncontinuum and a series of emission lines, is parameterized by the continuum slope \u03b1 and\nthe rest-frame equivalent width of the Ly\u03b1+NV emission line, EW(Ly\u03b1+NV) (abbreviated\nto EW in what follows). The synthetic absorption spectrum takes into account intervening\nHI absorbers along the line of sight, including Ly\u03b1 forest systems, Lyman Limit Systems\nand damped Lyman \u03b1 systems. We use the distribution functions of each kind of absorber\nused by Fan (1999).\nWe calculate the SDSS magnitudes from the model spectrum and add photometric\nerrors in each band. Our precedures differ in two ways from those of Appendix A of Fan\n(1999). First, we use updated SDSS filter response functions as described in Appendix\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nA. They are slightly different from those of Fukugita et al. (1996); in particular, the\nlong-wavelength cutoff of the g \u2032 , r \u2032 , i\u2032 and z \u2032 filters are 100 \u2013 300 \u00c5 bluer in the new\nmeasurements than in the old ones. For these broad-band filters, this difference has only\na small effect on the colors of normal stars. However, it does affect the model quasar\ncolors in certain redshift ranges for which the strong Ly\u03b1 emission line is near a filter edge.\nSecond, in the current calculation, we use the measured seeing for Runs 94 and 125, \u223c 1.6\u2032\u2032 ,\nto derive the photon noise of the PSF photometry. The seeing in these commissioning\nruns is worse than the 1.1\u2032\u2032 seeing assumed in Fan (1999). We further add the systematic\ncalibration error in each band in quadrature to the random errors, as in \u00a73.1.\nFor each object in the complete sample, a total of 1000 model quasars with the same\n(M1450 , z, \u03b1, EW ) are generated, and SDSS magnitudes calculated. The fraction of these\nwhich satisfy the selection criteria of Eqs. (1) and (2) is defined to be the detection\nprobability p, as listed in Table 4. It ranges from \u223c 100% for objects located in the part\nof the color-color diagrams farthest away from the stellar locus (see Figure 1) to \u223c 40%\nfor the objects near the boundary of the selection criteria. An object with a given intrinsic\nspectrum can move in and out of the selected region in color space due to differing amounts\nof absorption and photometric errors. The average probability hpi = 0.80 for the whole\nsample. This is considerably higher than that of Warren et al. (1994), hpi \u223c 0.5; the higher\nphotometric accuracy with CCDs enables us to probe much closer to the stellar locus in\ncolor space than do surveys using photographic plate data.\nNote that the spectral model above does not include contributions from BALs. For\nthe four possible BAL quasars in our sample, we also calculate the detection probability by\nadding the observed BAL troughs in the model spectra. The detection probability changed\nby <\n\u223c 10% in all four cases. There is no systematic effect and hpi remains at 0.78 for the\nwhole sample.\nThe color-selection criteria in Eqs. (1) and (2) choose regions in color space\nwell-separated from the stellar locus. Quasars with redder continua (larger |\u03b1|) and weaker\nemission lines are located in regions in the color-color diagrams close to normal stars. Any\ncolor-based selection will naturally select against these quasars. There may exist quasars\nwith an intrinsic SED shape such that their broad-band colors are so similar to normal stars\nthat their detection probability is close to zero. Thus it is difficult to correctly estimate the\nfraction of quasars that we would never find without assuming an a priori model for the\nintrinsic distribution of \u03b1 and EW. The selection probability is also a strong function of\nthe redshift and luminosity of the quasar. In Figure 5, we present the detection probability\nas a function of \u03b1 and EW at several different redshifts and luminosities to illustrate the\ndependence of p on these parameters.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nFigure 5(a) shows p at z = 3.7 and M1450 = \u221227 (\u03a9 = 1 model); this is near the\nlower redshift cutoff of the survey. The quasar is much brighter than the flux limit, so\nphotometric errors are not important. In this case, a quasar with \u03b1 \u223c \u22120.8 and EW = 70\n\u00c5, which are the mean values we derive in \u00a75.2, has p \u223c 80%; the completeness is rather\nhigh. The completeness is lower for objects with redder continua or weaker emission lines.\nThe detectability drops to \u223c 20% at \u03b1 \u223c \u22121.6, where i \u2212 z >\n\u223c 0.25. This selection bias\n\u2217\n\u2217\nis introduced by the selection criterion i \u2212 z < 0.25. This eliminates a large number of\ncompact E+A galaxies at z \u223c 0.4 which have very similar g \u2217 \u2212 r \u2217 and r \u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 colors to z \u223c 4\nquasars but are intrinsically redder than are quasars. In the final selection of the SDSS\nmain quasar sample, this condition will be relaxed. For objects with weak emission lines, p\ndrops for bluer continua as well. At z \u223c 3.7, such objects could have g \u2217 \u2212 r \u2217 < 1.0, and are\nthus excluded by the cut Eq. 1(c). This bias only affects redshifts close to the cutoff.\nFigure 5(b) shows p at z = 3.7 and M1450 = \u221225.5, corresponding to m1450 \u223c 20. This\nfigure is for the same redshift as Figure 5(a), but at the survey limiting luminosity. In this\ncase, p is much lower. At a given absolute magnitude, the observed apparent magnitudes of\na substantial fraction of quasars will be below the apparent magnitude cut (i\u2217 < 20.05) due\nto photometric errors. In addition, the large error in the g \u2032 band will scatter more quasars\nout of the selected region. However, the selection is actually somewhat more sensitive\nto larger \u03b1 here than for brighter objects at the same redshift (Figure 5a): p \u223c 20% for\n\u03b1 \u223c \u22121.8. This is because the photometric error in z \u2032 is \u223c 0.15 mag, scattering some\nobjects with red intrinsic continua back into the sample with i\u2217 \u2212 z \u2217 <\n\u223c 0.25.\nAt z \u223c 4.5, the Ly\u03b1 emission has moved out of the SDSS r \u2032 band, and lies in the gap\nbetween r \u2032 and i\u2032 . Thus neither the gri nor the riz selection are sensitive to these quasars.\nFigure 5(c) shows the detection probability at this redshift and at M1450 = \u221226.0, near the\nsurvey limiting luminosity. This is the region where the survey is most incomplete. For\ntypical values of \u03b1 and emission line strength, p \u223c 50%. At most redshifts, the presence of\na strong Ly\u03b1 emission line makes the Lyman break in the spectrum more distinct, pushing\nthe object further away from the stellar locus in color space. At z \u223c 4.5, however, with the\nLy\u03b1 emission line in the gap, quasars are closer to the stellar locus than either at higher or\nlower redshift, making them difficult to select.\nAt 4.6 < z < 5.2 (see Figure 1), the presence of strong Ly\u03b1 forest absorption in the\nspectrum causes the object to be very well separated from the stellar locus in the r \u2217 \u2212 i\u2217 vs.\ni\u2217 \u2212 z \u2217 color-color diagram. Figure 5(d) shows that at z = 5.0, the selection completeness is\nvery high, even for objects with weak emission lines or red continua. SDSS 1532\u201300 (Fan\net al. 1999b), a z = 4.62 quasar without emission lines, was found in the SDSS Spring\nEquatorial Stripe data using with the same selection criteria. This demonstrates that our\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nselection is not sensitive to emission line strength in this redshift range.\nThus, except in the redshift range z \u223c 4.4 \u2212 4.5 and for luminosities near the survey\nlimit, the detection probability is high and the selection criteria are sensitive to a large\nrange of (\u03b1, EW). We will further examine the average selection function in \u00a75.3 after\nderiving the distribution functions of the continuum slope and emission line strength in our\nsample.\n\n5.2.\n\nDistribution of Equivalent Width and Continuum Slope\n\nIn this subsection, we use the sample in Table 4 to estimate the distributions of \u03b1 and\nEW(Ly\u03b1+NV), after correcting the selection probability of each quasar. We first calculate\ntheir weighted means, then derive their distribution functions using a maximum likelihood\napproach and assume Gaussian distributions. The histograms in Figure 6 show the observed\ndistributions of the power-law continuum slope, \u03b1, and the rest-frame equivalent width of\nLy\u03b1+NV emission, EW. Using only the 35 non-BAL quasars, and weighting each object\nby the inverse of its selection probability p1i (Table 4), we find a mean EW of 71.0 \u00c5 with\na standard deviation of 18.3 \u00c5, at an average redshift hzi = 4.06. Similarly, using all 39\nquasars in the sample, and applying a weight of pi \u03b421(\u03b1) , where \u03b4i (\u03b1) is the error on the \u03b1\ni\nmeasurement, we find a mean \u03b1 of \u22120.80 with a standard deviation of 0.40.\nHowever, these distributions can be biased if there is a population of quasars with\nsmall p which are totally missing from the sample. Thus, we use a maximum likelihood\napproach. The likelihood of the observed (\u03b1i , EWi ) is given by:\nL=\n\nY\ni\n\nR\n\npi f (\u03b1i )f (EWi )\np(\u03b1, EW)f (\u03b1)f (EW)d\u03b1 d(EW)\n\n(7)\n\nwhere f (\u03b1) and f (EW) are the distribution functions of \u03b1 and EW. We assume both to be\nGaussian, and uncorrelated with each other,\n(\u03b1i \u2212 \u03b1)2\nexp \u2212 2\nf (\u03b1i ) = q\n.\n2(\u03b4i + \u03c3\u03b12 )\n2\u03c0 \u03b4i2 + \u03c3\u03b12\n\"\n\n1\n\n#\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03c3\u03b1 are the mean and standard deviation of its intrinsic distribution. Similarly,\n(EWi \u2212 EW)2\n1\n.\nexp \u2212\nf (EW) =\n2\n2\u03c0\u03c3EW\n2\u03c3EW\n\"\n\n#\n\n(9)\n\nNote that the normalizing integral p(\u03b1, EW)f (\u03b1)f (EW)d\u03b1 dEW in the denominator\nof the likelihood function is essential; without it, the maximum likelihood solution would\nR\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nnot depend on the choice of p, which is clearly wrong. However, as we show in \u00a75.1, the\nselection function p is a complicated function of M1450 , z, \u03b1 and EW. This integral cannot\nbe evaluated without knowing the underlying distribution function of z and M1450 , namely,\nthe luminosity function. A full solution requires maximizing the likelihood of the full\ndistribution function p(M1450 , z, \u03b1, EW)f (M1450 , z, \u03b1, EW). We will present the maximum\nlikelihood solution of the luminosity function in Paper IV, but we find that the distributions\nof \u03b1 and EW are rather insensitive to the choice of luminosity function, as it provides a\nweighting of the probability function, which is only a slow varying function of z and M1450 .\nUsing the luminosity function we find in Paper IV (for the \u03a9 = 1 model),\nlog \u03a6(M1450 , z) = \u22127.24 \u2212 0.48(z \u2212 3) + 0.63(M1450 + 26),\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03a6(M1450 , z) is the cumulative luminosity function in units of comoving Mpc\u22123 , we\nfind: hEWi = 69.3 \u00c5, \u03c3EW = 18.0 \u00c5, h\u03b1i = \u22120.79, and \u03c3\u03b1 = 0.34. In Figure 6, the\naverage \u03b1 value from the maximum likelihood solution is clearly offset from the observed\ndistribution, due to the selection bias against objects with redder continua. The results\nabove assume that the distributions of \u03b1 and EW are not correlated with each other or with\nredshift or luminosity. Luminosity and emission line strength are known to be correlated\n(the Baldwin (1977) effect), although for the small luminosity range (2 mag) our sample\ncovers, this is a rather small effect. These results change by less than 5% for a change of\nthe parameters in the assumed luminosity function by \u223c 30%.\nThese statistics can be compared with results from previous studies. Based on 30\nquasars at 3.1 < z < 4.75, Schneider et al. (1991) found EW(Ly\u03b1 + NV) = 82.3 \u00b1 29.8\n\u00c5. Note that most of the quasars in Schneider et al. (1991) are selected based on their\nslitless spectra, and are biased to quasars with stronger emission lines. Sargent, Steidel\n& Boksenberg (1989) found EW(Ly\u03b1 + NV) = 80.9 \u00b1 29.8 \u00c5 for a sample of 59 quasars\nat z > 2.75. Warren, Hewett & Osmer (1994) found a median equivalent width of\nEW(Ly\u03b1 + NV) = 68 \u00c5 for quasars at z > 2.2. Our result is consistent with these\nhigh-redshift samples. At lower redshift, the Large Bright Quasar Survey (LBQS) sample\nhas EW(Ly\u03b1+NV) = 52 \u00c5 (Francis et al. 1991).\nSchneider et al. (1991) found \u03b1 = \u22120.92 \u00b1 0.26, and Sargent, Steidel & Boksenberg\n(1989) found \u03b1 = \u22120.78 \u00b1 0.27, both consistent with our result. Our value is redder than\nthe values found from low redshift samples (e.g., the LBQS sample shows \u03b1med = \u22120.3).\nThis could be due to the fact that the \u03b1 values from low and high redshift samples are based\non different wavelength ranges. A detailed comparison of the continuum slope for different\nredshift ranges would require observations of high-redshift quasars at IR wavelengths.\nHowever, our purpose in determining \u03b1 is to reproduce the true color distribution of\nthe underlying quasar population and thus to calculate the selection function. Since we\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nmeasure \u03b1 by matching to the SDSS photometry, any bias will be small because of the\nlimited wavelength range in the optical spectrum of high-redshift quasars. The difference\nin the continuum slope between the low and high redshift sample and any deviations of\nthe underlying continuum from a power law, however, will affect the calculation of the\nK-correction, and the evolution of the luminosity function from z <\n\u223c 3 to z > 4 (Paper IV).\n\n5.3.\n\nSelection Completeness of the Quasar Sample\n\nIn Figure 7, we present the average selection probability for M1450 = \u221226.5, as functions\nof \u03b1 and EW, hp(\u03b1)i, and hp(EW)i, averaged over the survey redshift range 3.6 < z < 5.0.\nhp(\u03b1)i is defined as:\nhp(\u03b1)i =\n\nR 5.0\n3.6\n\np(M1450 , z, \u03b1)f (EW)\u03a8(M1450 , z) dVdz(z) dz\nR 5.0\n3.6\n\nf (EW)\u03a8(M1450 , z) dVdz(z) dz\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03a8(M1450 , z) = d\u03a6(M1450 , z)/dM is the differential luminosity function. The quantity\nhp(EW)i is similarly defined. This figure illustrates the selection completeness as a function\nof the quasar SED in \u00a75.1 more clearly. On average, the selection criteria are more sensitive\nto quasars with bluer continua. At this luminosity, where the effects of photometric errors\nare small, the average selection probability p >\n\u223c 80% for \u03b1 > \u22120.9, but drops to \u223c 40% for\n\u03b1 = \u22121.5, and to \u223c 20% for \u03b1 = \u22122.0. Note that \u03b1 = \u22121.5 is about 2 \u03c3 away from the\nmean \u03b1. Thus although the current survey is less complete for redder quasars, those objects\nare not excluded completely and can be corrected for by applying the selection function.\nThe figure also shows that the average selection probability is higher than 80% for quasars\nwith EW > 40 \u00c5, and is still higher than 50% for quasars with much weaker lines, EW \u223c\n20 \u00c5.\nFinally, we calculate the average selection probability of the high-redshift quasars in\nour sample as a function of redshift and luminosity p(M1450 , z), averaging over the \u03b1 and\nEW distributions. We calculate the quasar model colors following the same procedures\ndescribed in \u00a75.1, and assume that the intrinsic properties of quasars follow the distributions\nwe obtained in \u00a75.2. The selection function is calculated for both \u03a9 = 1 and \u039b models for\n\u221225 > M1450 > \u221230 and 3.6 < z < 5.2.\nThe results of the selection function are summarized in Figure 8 for both cosmologies.\nThe heavy solid line in the figure represents the 5% contour, indicating the survey limiting\nabsolute magnitude at each redshift. Our survey is cut at i\u2217 < 20.05 for gri selected\nquasars, and at i\u2217 < 20.2 for riz selected quasars. For the \u03a9 = 1 model, the survey reaches\nM1450 \u223c \u221225.3 at the lowest redshift z \u223c 3.6, and to M1450 \u223c \u221225.8 at z \u223c 4.5. The\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nsurvey then goes slightly deeper at 4.5 < z < 5.0, due to the fact that our riz selection goes\nslightly deeper than does the gri selection. Not surprisingly, the survey is more complete\nfor brighter quasars due to smaller photometric errors. The figure indicates that over the\nentire redshift range between 3.6 and 5.2, the survey is complete to at least 40% for quasars\nmore than \u223c 0.4 mag brighter than the survey limit. The main difference between the two\ncosmologies is a slight shift in the M1450 axis.\nThe survey completeness is a function of redshift: it is most complete in the redshift\nranges of 3.8 \u2013 4.2 and 4.7 \u2013 5.2, with p > 0.8 for bright quasars. As mentioned in \u00a75.1,\nthe lower completeness at z \u223c 3.6 is due to the g \u2217 \u2212 r \u2217 > 1.0 cut in the gri selection. The\ncompleteness is lowest at z \u223c 4.4 \u2212 4.5, about 50% for bright quasars. This is the region\nin which the Ly\u03b1 emission moves between the r \u2032 and i\u2032 filters, and the quasar moves from\nbeing selected with the gri selection of Eq. (1) to being selected with the riz selection\nof Eq. (2). The final quasar target selection algorithm in the SDSS uses a selection\nin multi-dimensional color space, and is expected to be more complete than the results\npresented here (see, e.g., Newberg & Yanny 1997).\nThe locations of the 39 quasars in the sample are also plotted on Figure 8. Note that\nthe average detection probability in Figure 8 is different from the values in Table 4, which\nis the detection probability for a specific type of intrinsic spectrum. Using the contours in\nFigure 8, we find an overall average hp(M1450 , z)i = 0.75 for the 39 quasars, which is slightly\nlower than hp(M1450 , z, \u03b1, EW)i = 0.80 we found in \u00a75.1.\n\n6.\n\nSummary\n\nIn this paper, we present a color-selected flux-limited sample of high-redshift quasars\nin the Fall Equatorial Stripe that includes 39 quasars at 3.6 < z < 5.0 and i\u2217 <\n\u223c 20, covering\n2\nan effective area of 182 deg . These objects are identified from 53 quasar candidates, giving\na success rate of 73%.\nFrom this sample, we estimate the average power law slope of the quasar spectrum\nin the rest-frame UV to be \u22120.79 with a standard deviation of 0.34; and the rest-frame\nequivalent width of the Ly\u03b1+NV emission line to be 69 \u00c5 with a standard deviation of 18\n\u00c5. These results are consistent with previous high-redshift quasar samples.\nWe derive the selection function of the survey as a function of redshift, luminosity and\nthe quasar SED shape. We show that on average, the selection criteria are more sensitive\nto quasars with bluer continua; the survey is incomplete for red quasars with \u03b1 < \u22121.8.\nThe selection probability does not strongly depend on the quasar emission line strength.\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nThe selection completeness is also a function of redshift. The survey is the most complete\nin the redshift range from 3.8 to 4.2 and 4.7 \u2013 5.2, while it suffers \u223c 50% incompleteness\nat z \u223c 4.5. The average selection probability for the whole sample is \u223c 75%. In Paper IV,\nwe use the high-redshift quasar sample and the survey selection function presented in this\npaper to study the evolution of the quasar luminosity function.\nThe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is a joint project of the University of Chicago,\nFermilab, the Institute for Advanced Study, the Japan Participation Group, The Johns\nHopkins University, the Max-Planck-Institute for Astronomy, Princeton University, the\nUnited States Naval Observatory, and the University of Washington.

It was found that\nthe passbands of the g \u2032 , r \u2032 , i\u2032 and z \u2032 filters had changed since the filters were measured\nprior to their installation in the camera in 1997. The major effect is that the red edges\nof these passbands are at wavelengths 3% bluer than the designed values (Fukugita et al.\n1996). For the g \u2032, r \u2032 and i\u2032 filters, the red cutoff is accomplished by an interference coating,\nwhereas the blue cutoff is done by a long-pass colloidal gold-in-glass glass filter. In the\nSDSS 2.5m imaging camera, the filters are cemented on the back face of the corrector, and\nthe interference films are exposed to the dewar vacuum (Gunn et al. 1998). The most\nplausible explanation for the change is that the oxide layers in the interference films have\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\ndehydrated in the vacuum and the refractive index of the layers have slightly changed. The\nmanufacturer, Asahi-Spectra Ltd, Tokyo, confirms that this is likely. The change in the z \u2032\nresponse is due to the improved measurement of the quantum efficiency at long wavelength\nfor the thick CCDs used in the camera.\nFigure A.1 presents the filter response curves for the new and old measurements. Table\nA.1 gives the effective wavelengths (defined in Eq. 3 in Fukugita et al. 1996) and FWHMs\nof the SDSS filters of the SDSS 2.5m imaging camera according to the new measurements.\nAlthough these new measurements are still preliminary, calculations are carried out with\nthe new system response curve throughout this paper.\n\nB.\n\nFaint Quasars from the Fall Equatorial Stripe\n\nThe SDSS will image the Fall Equatorial Stripe 35 \u2013 40 times during the five-year\nsurvey. Since the Fall Equatorial Stripe is in the southern Galactic Cap, it is called the\nSDSS Southern Survey (York et al. 2000). The final combined images of the Southern\nSurvey will reach r \u2032 \u223c 25, 2 magnitudes deeper than the main survey. These data will be\nused to search for fainter quasars, and to study the evolution and large scale distribution\nof quasars at much lower luminosities. During the commissioning phase of the survey, part\nof the Fall Equatorial Stripe has been imaged twice. The combined catalog from the two\nobservations is used to select quasar candidates at i\u2217 < 21, where the photometric error\nfrom a single observation is too large for efficient candidate selection. Eighteen high-redshift\nquasars are identified from these candidates. The algorithm to combine the imaging data\nand to search for faint quasar candidates is still under development, and the sample is far\nfrom complete. In this Appendix, we simply present the SDSS photometry and the spectra\nof these 18 quasars, some of which exhibit interesting spectral features.\nTable B.1 lists the SDSS imaging runs we used in the selection of faint quasars. The\noverlapping regions of Runs 94/259 (the Northern Strip of the Stripe, see York et al.\n2000) and Runs 125/273 (Southern Strip) were used. Tables B.2, B.3 and B.4, similar\nto Tables 1, 2 and 3, present the photometry, emission line, and continuum properties of\nthese 18 quasars. In Table B.2, the photometry in both observations are listed; in Table\nB.4, we do not measure the continuum slope from the photometry, due to the increasing\nphotometric errors, especially in the z \u2032 band. Figure B.1 gives the finding charts for these\nquasars. Figure B.2 presents the spectra. Sixteen of the spectra were obtained with the\nKeck II/LRIS during the 1999 October observing run. Three of the faint quasars have very\npoor signal-to-noise ratio beyond 8000 \u00c5 thus we do not show this spectral region in the\nfigure. Two objects (SDSSp J024434.87+000124.9 and SDSSp J024452.33\u2013003318.0) were\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nobserved with the ARC 3.5m telescope in 1999 December and 2000 January.\n\nB.1.\n\nNote for Individual Objects\n\nSDSSp J010905.81+001617.1 (z = 3.68). This has a number of absorption systems in\nthe spectrum, identified both by their C IV \u03bb1548,1551 and Si IV \u03bb1394,1403 absorption\nlines, including two narrow-line systems, at z = 3.71 (higher than the emission-line redshift),\nand at z = 3.59, respectively; and two broad features at z = 3.43 (with C IV absorption\ncentered at 6855 \u00c5 and Si IV at 6233 \u00c5), and at z = 3.33 (with C IV and Si IV absorption\nat 6700 \u00c5 and 6063 \u00c5).\nSDSSp J015015.58+004555.7 (z = 3.91). This is a BAL quasar, with a velocity (average\nof C IV and Si IV features) of \u223c 7300 km s\u22121 .\nSDSSp J023749.33+005715.6 (z = 3.57). This quasar has very narrow emission lines.\nThe Ly\u03b1 and N V emission lines are clearly separated. The Si IV emission line shows two\npeaks, from the Si IV \u03bb1394, 1403 components. The average FWHM of the emission lines\nis only \u223c 1500 km s\u22121 . Quasars (and Seyfert 1s) with FWHM less than 2000 km s\u22121 are\nusually classified as Narrow Line Quasars (or Narrow Line Seyfert 1s, which typically have\nlines broader than Seyfert 2s and with smaller [O III]/H\u03b2 ratio, see, e.g. Baldwin et al.\n1988, Osterbrock & Pogge 1985). Those object tend to have strong Fe II emission and soft\nX-ray spectra, and are thought to be either AGNs with face-on orientation, or represent\na higher accretion rate (e.g., Leighly 1999 and reference therein). This is the first narrow\nline quasar at z > 3.5 of which we are aware. A damped Ly\u03b1 candidate is also detected at\nz = 3.26 (\u03bb = 5177 \u00c5).\nSDSSp J024347.37\u2013010611.7 (z = 3.90). The strong absorption at 7268/7286 \u00c5 is due\nto a Mg II absorption system at z = 1.600. The total rest-frame equivalent width is 12.3 \u00c5.\nAbsorption lines corresponding to several FeII features at the same redshift are also visible\n(at 6758\u00c5, 6723\u00c5, 6193\u00c5, 6172\u00c5 and 6094 \u00c5).\nSDSSp J031427.92+002339.4 (z = 3.68). Several metal line systems are detected: two\nC IV/Si IV systems are at z = 3.55 and z = 3.48, and there is a Mg II system at z = 1.11.\nSDSSp J032459.10\u2013005705.1 (z = 4.80). This is a very odd-looking high-redshift\nquasar. The Ly\u03b1+N V emission is clearly affected by strong absorption, and the emission\nline seems very narrow. The O I emission is barely detected, but it is affected by the telluric\nA-band. The redshift is determined by a fit to the O I line.\nSDSSp J033505.43+010337.2 (z = 3.58). Most of the rich absorption lines in the\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nspectrum of this quasar seem to be actually due to one very strong associated absorption\nsystem at the same redshift as the emission lines. A entire suite of absorption features due\nto different ions can be identified, including N V \u03bb1238+1240, Si II \u03bb1260, O I \u03bb1302, Si II\n\u03bb1304, C II \u03bb1334, Si IV \u03bb1393+1402, Si II \u03bb1526 and C IV \u03bb1548+1550.\n\nREFERENCES\nBaldwin, J.
