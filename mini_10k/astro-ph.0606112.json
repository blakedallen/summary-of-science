Galactic globular cluster (GC) stars exhibit abundance patterns which are not shared by their field counterparts, e.g.\nthe well documented O-Na and Mg-Al anticorrelations. A widely held hypothesis is that the gas was \"polluted\" by stars more\nmassive than the presently observed low-mass stars. In the framework of this \"self-enrichment\" scenario for GCs, we present a\nnew method to derive the Initial Mass Function (IMF) of the polluters, by using the O/Na abundance distribution.\nMethods. We focus on NGC 2808, a GC for which the largest sample of O and Na abundance determinations is presently\navailable. We use the abundance distribution of [O/Na] to derive the amount of polluted material with respect to that of\noriginal composition. We explore in details two scenarios for the self-enrichment of the cluster, which differ by the assumptions\nmade on the composition of the polluter ejecta. In each case we consider two classes of possible \"culprits\" : massive Asymptotic\nGiant Branch (AGB) stars (4-9 M\u2299 ) and winds of massive stars (WMS) in the mass range 10-100 M\u2299 .\nResults. We obtain upper limits for the slope of the IMF (assumed to be given by a power-law) of the stars initially more massive\nthan the present turnoff mass. We also derive lower limits for the amount of stellar residues in NGC 2808.\nConclusions. We find that the polluter IMF had to be much flatter than presently observed IMFs in stellar clusters; this is in\nagreement with the results of two other methods for GC IMF determination, which we also discuss. Additionaly, we find that\nthe present mass of the GC should be totally dominated by stellar remnants if the polluters were AGB stars; this is not the\ncase if the culprits are WMS. We critically analyse the advantages and shortcomings of each potential polluter class, and we\nfind the WMS scenario more attractive.\nKey words. Stars: abundances, mass function; Galaxy: abundances, globular clusters:general, globular clusters: individual:\nNGC2808\n\n1. Abundance anomalies in galactic globular\nclusters and the self-enrichment scenario\nGlobular cluster (GC) studies are linked to a large variety of astrophysical issues. These stellar systems provide\nindeed insights into the formation and early chemical evolution of galaxies and of their substructures. They also\nrepresent unique laboratories for dynamical processes that\noccur on timescales shorter than the Hubble time (such\nas two-body relaxation, mass segregation from equipartition of energy, stellar encounters, collisions and mergers,\ncore collapse, tidal stripping). Because they are large aggregates of coeval stars, all located at the same distance\nfrom us, and which contain both very common and unusual (e.g., blue stragglers) stellar objects, they provide\ninvaluable tests to stellar evolution theory. However, and\ndespite their broad astrophysical importance, their origin\nand formation processes still remain uncertain.\n\nFor all these reasons galactic GCs have been subject\nto intensive scrunity over the past decades. The advent of\nvery large telescopes and of multiple-object spectrometers\nallowed a detailed investigation of their chemical composition (see Gratton et al. 2004 and Sneden 2005 for recent\nand extended reviews). We briefly recall here the fundamental chemical properties of the galactic GCs :\n(i) Most of them appear to be mono-metallic as far as\nthe Fe-group elements (Fe, Ni, Cu) are concerned (with\nthe notable exception of Omega Cen);\n(ii) They present very low scatter and the same trends\nas field stars for the neutron-capture elements (Ba, La,\nEu) and the alpha-elements (Si, Ca);\n(iii) For the lighter elements (from C to Al) they exhibit complex patterns and large star-to-star abundance\nvariations, which are not shared by their field counterparts. Among these anomalous patterns, the most striking\nones are the anticorrelations between the abundances of\n\n\f2\n\nN. Prantzos and C. Charbonnel: Self-enrichment and the IMF of globular clusters\n\nO and Na (see Pilachowski 1984, Drake et al. 1992 and\nSneden et al. 1991 for the early studies; for complete references see Gratton et al. 2004) and of Mg and Al (see\ne.g. Ivans et al. 1999, Ramirez & Cohen 2002)1.\nThese anticorrelations are easily understood as the\nresult of proton-capture nucleosynthesis in the CNOcycle and the NeNa- and MgAl-chains of H-burning\n(Denissenkov & Denissenkova 1990; Langer et al. 1993).\nProton-captures on 16 O and 22 Ne respectively lead to the\ndestruction of O and to the production of 23 Na at temperatures > 2 \u00d7 107 K. At higher temperatures (\u223c 4 \u00d7 107 K),\n20\nNe generates 23 Na. On the other hand the MgAl-chain\nis only active at temperatures higher than \u223c 7 \u00d7 107 K.\nAlthough the underlying nucleosynthesis is unambiguous, the identification of the corresponding astrophysical\nsite still remains a challenge. For a long time the main\nquestion was to know if such patterns were inherited at\nthe birth of the stars that we are currently observing (the\nso-called self-enrichment hypothesis) or if they were generated in the course of the evolution of these objects (the\nso-called evolution hypothesis). A major breakthrough was\nmade in that respect from high resolution spectrographs\non very large telescopes that allowed one to determine\nthe abundances of the concerned elements in faint subgiant and turnoff stars in a couple of GCs (Gratton et\nal. 2001; Grundhal et al. 2002; Carretta et al. 2003, 2004;\nRamirez & Cohen 2002, 2003). The discovery of the abovementioned anticorrelations in these scarcely evolved objects has given a new spin to the self-enrichment scenario.\nIndeed turnoff stars are not hot enough for the required\nnuclear reactions to occur in their interiors. Additionally\nthe spread of abundances cannot be explained by in situ\nmechanisms like gravitational setlling and thermal diffusion (Richard et al. 2002, Michaud et al. 2004). This implies that the O, Na, Mg and Al abundance anomalies preexisted in the material out of which these objects formed;\ntheir gas must have been polluted early in the history\nof the cluster by more massive and faster evolving stars\n(Cottrell & Da Costa 1981)2 .\nIt has long been debated whether GCs were made out\nof totally metal-free material or out of the same gas as\nthe halo field stars (progressively metal-enriched, during\n1\n\nStar-to-star variations of the strengths of the lines of these\nelements (Na and Al in particular) were known to exist at the\ntip of the red giant branch (RGB) for a long time (Cohen 1978;\nPeterson 1980; Norris et al. 1981; see Kraft 1994 for an early\nreview).\n2\nAn alternative would be that the abundance anomalies\nwere accreted onto the surface of low-mass stars from the mass\nloss by massive stars (D'Antona et al. 1983; Thoul et al. 2002).\nIn this case only the surface convective layers would have a\npolluted composition, and the anomalies would disappear on\nthe red giant branch due to dilution during the first dredgeup event. However turnoff and bright giant stars exhibit the\nsame anti-correlations; this means that the entire star, or at\nleast 80% of its mass (which corresponds approximately to the\nmaximum depth of the convective envelope during the first\ndredge-up) has the composition of the photosphere.\n\nthe halo chemical evolution). The former is the \"classical\" self-enrichment scenario (Cayrel 1986; Fall & Rees\n1985; Truran et al. 1991; Brown et al. 1991; Parmentier\net al. 1999; Parmentier 2004), while the latter is a \"preenrichment\" scenario (e.g. Harris and Pudritz 1994).\nThe classical self-enrichment scenario assumes that\nstars within the GCs made the totality of the metals\n(light and heavy) and it involves three stellar generations.\nA first generation of exclusively massive stars is clustered in the central regions of the progenitor cloud and\ntheir SNII explosions rapidly enrich the intra-cluster gas\nin iron, \u03b1- and heavy elements, but not in s-elements; the\nresulting [Ba/Eu] and [Sr/Ba] ratios should thus reflect\npure r-process synthesis (Truran 1988). A second stellar\ngeneration is formed out of this gas, and a sub-class of\nrapidly evolving stars injects into the ISM products of Hburning (and nothing else). The third generation formed\nfrom these ejecta has the same uniform heavy element\ncontent (in alpha- and heavier than Fe elements) as the\nsecond one, but a dispersion in its light metal abundances.\nThe long lived stars of the second and third generations\nare those observed today.\nOn the other hand the pre-enrichment scenario assumes that GCs were born with their current heavy metal\ncontent and it invokes only two stellar generations: the\nfirst of them produces only the light metals which contaminate the gas of the second generation and builds up\nthe observed anticorrelations (i.e. they are equivalent to\nthe second and third generations of the previous scenario).\nThe two scenarios differ in a key point: the slow\nneutron capture component of the heavy elements (scomponent). In the first scenario, only the rapid neutron\ncapture component (r-component), produced in SNII, may\nexist, whereas in the latter the s-component appears naturally (exactly as in the field stars of similar metallicity). A\nrecent high resolution and high S/N spectroscopic analysis\nof turnoff and early subgiant stars in three GCs spanning a\nlarge range in [Fe/H] values (James et al. 2004a, b) showed\nthat the [Ba/Eu] and [Sr/Ba] ratios in GCs follow the\ntrends found in field stars over the same metallicity range.\nSince Ba and Sr are s-elements, while Eu is an r-element,\nthese findings clearly indicate a similar and uniform enrichement by both r- and s-process nucleosynthesis in both\npopulations (halo field stars and GCs). Consequently, the\n\"classical\" self-enrichment scenario is disfavoured.\nAnother important result of the work of James et al.\n(2004a, b) is that no dispersion is found for s-element\nabundances within each individual GC (see also Armosky\net al. 1994), nor any correlation with the O and Na patterns. This indicates that the stars responsible for the\nlight element anticorrelations did not produce significant\namounts of s-process elements.\nIn view of the aforementioned observational constraints, one concludes that the GC heavy metals must\ncome from pre-enrichment and that only light metals up\nto Al are produced in situ. It is this scenario that will be\ncalled hereafter \"the self-enrichment scenario\".\n\n\fN. Prantzos and C. Charbonnel: Self-enrichment and the IMF of globular clusters\n\nOne key aspect of the problem is that the O-Na anticorrelation is found in all GCs where it has been looked for,\nindependently of their characteristics, i.e., in disk and halo\nGCs spanning a large range in metallicity and in physical properties (such as horizontal branch morphology, total cluster mass, concentration and density; see Carretta\n2006 and Carretta et al. 2006). It appears to be an intrinsic property of those stellar systems. Understanding\nthe related self-enrichment process would obviously shed\nlight on GC formation and on the physical processes which\ndominate the primordial phases of their evolution.\nIn particular one may try to constrain the Initial Mass\nFunction (IMF) of GCs in the framework of the selfenrichment scenario. Such an attempt was first made by\nSmith and Norris (1982) on the basis of the then available data on C-N anticorrelation in NGC6752 and 47\nTuc. They found that the observed depletion of C in the\ncyanogen enhanced stars of those clusters can be achieved\nonly if the IMF of the first generation stars had a slope\nX <-0.4 (where X=1.35 is the Salpeter value) and an\nupper mass limit <11 M\u2299 .\nIn the present work we discuss the case of NGC 2808;\nit is the GC for which the largest sample of O and Na\nabundance determinations is available. On the basis of recent data, we derive the O/Na abundance distribution of\nthe cluster (\u00a7 2). We explore two scenarios for the selfenrichment (\u00a7 3), and in both cases we consider two possible classes of \"polluters\" : (i) massive AGB stars (4 to\n9 M\u2299 ) which undergo hot bottom burning and which are\nusually considered as the best culprits, and (ii) winds of\nrotating massive stars (WMS), which offer an interesting alternative, as we argue in \u00a7 5. From the analysis of\nNGC 2808 data we constrain the IMF of the stars initially\nmore massive than the ones surviving today, i.e., the GC\nIMF above 0.8 M\u2299 , and we discuss the implications for\nthe amount of stellar residues (\u00a7 4). In (\u00a7 5) we discuss the\nvarious (often extreme) assumptions made in the course\nof our analysis and we argue that, in a realistic scenario,\nthe IMF should be even flatter than the ones we derive in\n\u00a7 4. We also discuss the advantages and shortcomings of\nthe two classes of polluters, AGBs and WMS. In \u00a7 6 we\nsummarize our work.\n\n2.

(2006) detected both\nNa and O in 91 RGB stars of the cluster and obtained\nupper limits for O abundances for another 36 giants with\nNa abundance determinations. The spread in O and Na\nabundances is seen in stars of all luminosities along the\nRGB, pointing out a primordial origin with no significant\ncontribution from internal evolution of the stars (see also\nCarretta et al. 2003).\nThe data of Carretta et al. (2006) for the 91 stars where\nboth O and Na are detected, are displayed in Fig. 1. It is\n\n3\n\nFig. 1. Na vs O anticorrelation in NGC 2808. Data for a\nsample of 91 stars, with both Na and O detections, are\nfrom Carretta et al. (2006). Open squares indicate average abundances in the seven bins of the adopted O/Na\ndistribution (see Fig. 2 and \u00a7 2).\nclearly seen that the ratio [O/Fe]3 varies from \u223c0.5 down\nto \u223c\u20131, i.e. by a factor of \u223c30, while at the same time\nNa increases from [Na/Fe]\u223c\u20130.2 to \u223c0.8, i.e. by a factor\nof \u223c10. Regarding the O-depletion levels, NGC 2808 is\nvery similar to M13 (Sneden et al. 2004); both clusters\ndisplay the most severe variations reported up to now.\nSince the value of [O/Fe]=0.5 is typical of field halo stars\n(e.g. Spite et al. 2005), it is usually assumed that stars\ndisplaying that ratio (and correspondingly low [Na/Fe])\nare those that maintain their original composition, the one\nof the proto-cluster gas. On the contrary, stars displaying\nthe lowest [O/Fe] and highest [Na/Fe] have been severely\ncontaminated by some external agent (in the framework\nof the self-enrichment scenario). Stars with intermediate\ncompositions are born from gas which was contaminated\nto a smaller extent.\nBecause of the anticorrelation, the ratio [O/Na] varies\nmore than either [O/Fe] or [Na/Fe], from \u20131.55 to 0.55,\nand offers a larger basis for a statistical analysis of the\nabundance distribution within NGC 2808. Such a distribution has already been presented in Carretta et al. (2006),\nbut we adopt here a different (and, in our opinion, more\nappropriate) one, obtained along the following criteria:\nThe average error bars for [O/Fe] and [Na/Fe] in the\n91 star sample of Carretta et al. (2006) are \u03c3\u0304O =0.077 dex\nand \u03c3\u0304N a =0.098 dex, respectively. For each star, the er3\n\nIn\nthe\nusual\nnotation\nof\nspectroscopists,\n[O/Fe]=log10 (O/Fe)\u2217 -log10 (O/Fe)\u2299 , where \u2217 and \u2299 denote stellar and solar values, respectively.\n\n\f4\n\nN. Prantzos and C. Charbonnel: Self-enrichment and the IMF of globular clusters\n\np\n2 + \u03c32\nror in the [O/Na] ratio \u03c3ON a = \u03c3O\nN a is calculated,\nand the average is found to be \u03c3\u0304ON a =0.14. We consider\nthen bins in [O/Na] of width \u2206[O/Na]=0.30, i.e. slightly\nlarger than twice the average error on that ratio. Provided\nthe quoted error bars reflect reliably statistical errors, it\ncan be reasonably argued that stars found in different bins\nhave a trully different composition (in a statistically significant way) at least as far as O and Na are concerned. The\nfull range of the [O/Na] spectrum is covered by seven such\nbins, with values of [O/Na] ranging from \u20131.4 to 0.4. The\naverage abundances of [O/Fe] and [Na/Fe] in the seven\n[O/Na] bins are shown in Fig. 1.\nThe resulting distribution histogram appears in Fig. 2.\nThe number of stars in each [O/Na] bin has been multiplied by 100/91, i.e. an overall normalization to 100 stars\nhas been applied, allowing one to read directly in the histogram percentages of the total. Thus, 30% of the stars\nin the rightmost bin have on average a composition of\n[O/Na]=0.40, i.e. the highest O/Na ratio, which presumably reflects the original composition of the cluster. The\nremaining 70% of the stars have a composition modified\nto various degrees by the nucleosynthesis products of stars\nthat evolved in relatively short timescales (<108 yr), i.e.\nstars with initial mass M>4 M\u2299 , according to the selfenrichment scenario (e.g. Ventura et al. 2001).\n\n3. Polluting agents and pollution scenarios\nUsually, it is claimed that Hot Bottom Burning (HBB)\nin massive Asymptotic Giant Branch stars (AGBs) is\nresponsible for the observed composition anomalies in\nGCs (Cottrell & Da Costa 1981)4 . Several custom-made\ndetailed AGB models were recently computed in order\nto test the HBB hypothesis (Ventura et al. 2001, 2002;\nDenissenkov & Herwig 2003; Karakas & Lattanzio 2003;\nHerwig 2004a,b; Ventura & D'Antona 2005a,b,c). Most of\nthese studies concluded that the AGB pollution scenario\nsuffers from severe drawbacks from the point of view of\nthe nucleosynthesis (e.g., Fenner et al. 2004, Charbonnel\n2005). These difficulties stem from the subtle competition\nbetween HBB and third dredge-up (which contaminates\nthe stellar envelope with the products of helium burning).\nThe problems can be summarized as follows : (i) O is\nnot depleted to the extent required by the observations,\nwhile Na is over-produced or over-destroyed depending on\nthe treatment of convection; (ii) Mg is produced while\nit should be destroyed, and the Mg isotopic ratio is in\nconflict with the (rare) available data; (iii) C+N+O does\nnot remain constant in AGB processed material, in contrast to observations (Dickens et al. et al. 1991; Smith et\n4\n\nIn their pioneer paper Cottrell & Da Costa (1981) suggest\nthat Na and Al enrichment in CN-strong stars of the GCs\n47Tuc and NGC 6752 might be produced within intermediate\nmass stars (\u223c 5 - 10 M\u2299 ). However the invoked process is\nneutron-captures on 22 Ne and 25 Mg within the thermal pulse\n(the neutrons being released by the 22 Ne(\u03b1,n)25 Mg reaction;\nsee Iben 1976).\n\nFig. 2. Distribution histogram of stars of NGC 2808 (in\npercentages of total) as a function of [O/Na]; the distribution is calculated from data obtained by Caretta et al.\n(2006) (\u00a7 2). Stars in the rightmost bin (30%) are presumably born with the original (unprocessed) composition of\nthe cluster ([O/Na]=0.40) while the remaining 70% have\na composition processed to various degrees through Hburning. Scenario I (see text) assumes the processed composition to originate directly from the H-processed ejecta\nof AGB stars (4-9 M\u2299 ) or massive stars (10-100 M\u2299 ), born\nwith the original composition.\n\nal. 1996; Smith et al. 2005; Ivans et al. 1999). Rotationinduced mixing makes the situation even worse (Decressin\n& Charbonnel 2005; Decressin et al. in preparation) by\nstrongly enriching in O the envelope of intermediate-mass\nstars, already during the second dredge-up event. Last but\nnot least, it is sometimes claimed that massive AGB stars\nare not expected to pollute the intracluster gas with sprocess elements, in agreement with the observational requirements obtained by James et al. (2004) and presented\nin \u00a7 1; indeed, lower mass AGBs (1.5-3 M\u2299 ) are commonly considered to be the main source of s-elements in\nthe Galaxy. However, s-process nucleosynthesis (from neutrons released by 22 Ne(\u03b1,n)) may certainly occur if temperatures in the thermal pulses of massive AGB stars are\nsufficiently large (e.g. Goriely & Siess 2005 and references\ntherein). Very few quantitative studies have been devoted\nto that point, which clearly deserves additional investigation. Until the question is settled, it should not be taken\nas granted that massive AGBs do not produce s-elements\nat all; in our opinion, this constitutes another potential\nproblem about their role as polluters of GCs.\nAlthough it is too early to discard the AGB hypothesis, we feel that hydrogen burning in rotating massive\n\n\fN. Prantzos and C. Charbonnel: Self-enrichment and the IMF of globular clusters\n\nstars may offer an interesting alternative (Decressin et al.,\nin preparation). In fact, as we argue in \u00a7 4, the latter alternative may be more attractive, as far as the constraints\non the IMF are concerned; other advantages of that idea\nare qualitatively discussed in \u00a7 5. In the following, we explore both possibilities for the mass range of the polluting\nstars, namely, we consider AGB stars of masses 4 - 9 M\u2299\nand massive stars of mass >10 M\u2299 .\nWe explore two scenarios for the self-enrichment, which\ndiffer by the degree of nuclear processing in the ejecta of\nthe polluters and thus by the nature of the gas (i.e., pure\nstellar ejecta, or mixture of ejecta with gas of original composition) out of which the low-mass stars still surviving\ntoday were formed. In this section we present in detail the\nunderlying assumptions and we evaluate the amount of\nejecta vs. the amount of long lived stars required in each\nscenario. Then in \u00a7 4 we derive the corresponding constraints on the IMF for each scenario, in the cases where\neither intermediate or massive stars are the polluters.\n\n3.1. Scenario I\nThe first scenario that we consider is the simpler one; it\nassumes that :\nI-a) Stars with masses between 0.1 and 100 M\u2299 are\nformed from gas of \"normal\" composition (i.e. the same\ncomposition as the one of field halo stars at that time,\nmeaning for instance that [O/Na]=0.4) and with an IMF\nthat has to be determined;\nI-b) The ejecta of some (rapidly evolving) sub-class\nof those stars are polluted to various degrees by internal\nnucleosynthesis (i.e. the [O/Na] ratio in the ejecta varies\nbetween -1.4 and 0.25), with an abundance distribution\ngiven by Fig. 2.\nI-c) The ejecta are fully retained in the cluster and\nform directly (i.e., without being mixed with some original matter) a second generation of stars with mass 0.10.8 M\u2299 , the same IMF as the one of the 1st generation\nlow-mass stars, and with a composition obviously different\nfrom the original one (as far as the H-burning products are\nconcerned);\nI-d) Among the long-lived stars that we see today (with\nmasses in the 0.1-0.8 M\u2299 range) in NGC 2808, 30% are\nformed from the original gas and 70% from the polluted\nejecta.\nWe shall see that this \"Scenario I\" puts heavy constraints on the shape of the original IMF of the polluting stars, requiring it to be much flatter than the one\nobserved today in Galactic and extragalactic stellar clusters. Indeed, it implies that the mass of the polluted ejecta\nshould be about 2.3 times larger (70/30=2.33) than the\ntotal mass of the first generation stars that survive today\n(of mass between 0.1 and 0.8 M\u2299 ). Moreover, if AGBs are\nassumed to be the polluting agents, we show that this scenario leads to the concomitant production of a large number of stellar remnants (mostly white dwarfs), the mass of\nwhich should be larger than the stellar mass of the clus-\n\n5\n\nter today. On the contrary, if massive stars are assumed\nto be the polluting agents, the mass of stellar remnants\nis found to be considerably reduced. On the other hand,\nfrom the stellar nucleosynthesis point of view this scenario\nappears rather reasonable, since it invokes ejecta contaminated to various degrees (including very small ones) with\nthe products of H-burning.\n\n3.2. Scenario II\nOur second scenario assumes that:\nII-a) Stars with masses between 0.1 and 100 M\u2299 are\nformed from gas of \"normal\" composition (i.e. the same\ncomposition as the one of field halo stars at that time,\nmeaning for instance that [O/Na]=0.4) and with an IMF\nthat has to be determined (this is identical to I-a);\nII-b) The ejecta of some (rapidly evolving) sub-class\nof those stars are polluted to an extreme degree by internal nucleosynthesis (i.e. the [O/Na] ratio in the ejecta is\ninvariably -1.4);\nII-c) The time-scale of the evolution of the polluters is\nshorter than the formation time-scale of the low-mass stars\n(0.1-0.8 M\u2299 ), i.e. shorter than about 100 Myr (Stahler &\nPalla 2005). Then, the (extremely-processed) ejecta are\nmixed to various degrees with the gas of low-mass protostars of original composition, which are still forming.\nII-d) Among the long-lived stars that we see today\n(with masses in the 0.1-0.8 M\u2299 range) in NGC 2808, 30%\nare formed from the original gas (they have not been contaminated at all by the ejecta) and 70% from various mixtures of the extremely-processed ejecta with the original\ngas.\nObviously, the starting and ending points of the two\nscenarios are identical (as they should, since they must\nboth account for the observed abundance distribution in\nFig. 2). They differ in the intermediate steps. Scenario I involves two clearly distinct stellar generations, the second\nof which is made exclusively by the nuclearly processed\nejecta of the first one. Scenario II involves only one stellar generation, the low-mass stars of which (0.1-0.8 M\u2299 )\nare contaminated at formation and to various degrees by\nthe extremely-processed ejecta of their more massive and\nrapidly evolving sisters.\nThe assumption of extreme processing of the ejecta\nin Scenario II is neither mandatory (ejecta with various\ndegrees of processing could also be assumed, as in Scenario\nI), nor easy to justify on physical grounds, as we shall\ndiscuss in \u00a7 5. However, it is made here for two reasons:\na) Combined with the abundance distribution diagram\nof NGC 2808 (top panel of Fig. 3) it allows one to evaluate in a well defined way the degree of mixing between\nprocessed and original material in the various [O/Na] bins\n(see middle and bottom panels of Fig. 3 and next paragraphs).\nb) Precisely because the composition of the ejecta is so\nextreme, less material of processed composition is required\nfor the mixture. Consequently, the constraints on the IMF\n\n\f6\n\nN. Prantzos and C. Charbonnel: Self-enrichment and the IMF of globular clusters\n\nexclusively stars still visible today). If stars with M>0.8\nM\u2299 are assumed to be also formed from the ejecta, the\nrequired ejecta mass would be still larger and the corresponding IMF of the polluters even flatter than the ones\nwe derive in the next section.\nIn order to evaluate the amount of ejecta with\nextremely-processed composition in the framework of\nScenario II, we proceed as follows: assuming a mixture of\nunit mass of extremely-processed matter (mass fraction of\na given element XEP roc ) with f parts of original matter\n(mass fraction XOrig ), the corresponding mass fraction\nXMixt in the mixture will be:\nXMixt =\n\nXEP roc + f XOrig\n1+f\n\nFor the ratio of two elements a and b one has then\n\u0012\n\u0013\nXa\nXa,EP roc + f Xa,Orig\n=\nXb Mixt\nXb,EP roc + f Xb,Orig\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nfrom which one may recover the dilution factor f as\nf =\n\nFig. 3. Top: Distribution histogram of stars of NGC 2808\n(in percentages of total) as a function of [O/Na] (same\nas in Fig. 2). Stars in the rightmost bin (30%) are presumably born with the original (unprocessed) composition of the cluster ([O/Na]=0.40) while the remaining\n70% have a contaminated composition. Scenario II (see\ntext) assumes that the mixed composition is obtained by\nmixing extremely-processed material (E-processed, with\n[O/Na]=-1.40, leftmost bin) with unprocessed one, to various degrees, as explained in \u00a7 3.2. Middle: open and\nfilled circles indicate the amount of extremely-processed\n(pi ) and unprocessed (ui ) matter in each bin, respectively, while the histogram is the same as in the top panel\n(but in a logarithmic scale). Bottom: Cumulative distributions of total (squares), extremely-processed (open circles)\nand unprocessed matter (filled circles), starting from the\nleftmost bin. Final values on the right are P =35% for\nthe extremely-processed and U =65% for the unprocessed\namounts of matter, respectively (see \u00a7 3.2).\n\n(from the required ratio between mass of ejecta and mass\nin low-mass stars of 0.1-0.8 M\u2299 ) are less severe than in\nScenario I, as we show hereafter.\nAt this point, it should be stressed that our assumption that only stars of 0.1 to 0.8 M\u2299 are formed from the\nejecta (points I-c and II-c) is also made only in order to\nminimize the constraint on the IMF of the polluters (since\ntheir ejecta are used in a most efficient way, by forming\n\nXa,EP roc \u2212 (Xa /Xb )Mixt Xb,EP roc\n(Xa /Xb )Mixt Xb,Orig \u2212 Xa,Orig\n\n(3)\n\nas a function of the abundance ratio (Xa /Xb )Mixt , provided the abundances of a and b in the original and the\nprocessed material are given.\nIn the framework of our Scenario II, we obtain the\nabundances of O and Na in the original and processed material by finding the corresponding values in the rightmost\nand leftmost bins, respectively, of the adopted [O/Na] distribution. These values appear in Fig. 1 (where the averages [O/Fe] and [Na/Fe] in each of the adopted [O/Na]\nbins appear as open squares) and are:\n[O/F e]Orig = 0.38,\n[N a/F e]Orig = \u22120.03,\n[O/F e]EP roc = \u22120.72,\n[N a/F e]EP roc = 0.70.\nThe metallicity of NGC 2808 is [Fe/H]=\u20131.1 (Carretta\net al. 2006), which allows one to find the absolute abundances of O and Na in the original and processed material.\nTurning all abundances into mass fractions, one may solve\nthen Equ. 3 and find the dilution factor fi for each one\nof the [O/Na] bins (i=1,...,7) in Fig. 3. Obviously, in the\nleftmost bin (material of extremely-processed composition\nexclusively) one has, by definition f1 =0, while in the rightmost bin (material of original composition only) very large\nvalues are found for f7 (f7 \u2192 \u221e).\nAs mentioned in \u00a7 2, the number of stars in each\nbin (ni ) represents also the percentage of material with\n(mixed) abundance ratio [O/Na] (since the total has been\nnormalised to 100).

Obviously, in the leftmost bin\n(f1 =0) one has p1 =n1 , while in the rightmost bin u7 =n7 .\nBy summing the amounts of the processed and unprocessed material over the seven bins, one obtains then the\ncorresponding total amounts as\nP = \u03a3 pi ,\n\nU = \u03a3 ui\n\n(6)\n\nThose quantities appear in the rightmost bin of the bottom panel of Fig. 3. There is P =35% of material with\nextremely-processed composition and U =65% with original composition in the surviving stars of NGC 2808, in\nthe framework of our Scenario II.\n\n3.3. Summary\nThe two scenarios considered here are sketched in Figures\n4 and 5 respectively. The numbers appearing on those figures are percentages of the final total mass in low-mass\nlong-lived stars (0.1-0.8 M\u2299 ), derived from our previous\nanalysis (see also Fig. 3). There is a big quantitative difference between the two scenarios, concerning the ratio\n\n7\n\nFig. 5. Illustration of Scenario II, with numbers corresponding to the analysis performed in \u00a7 3.2 and Fig. 3.\n65% of the material of currently surviving low-mass stars\nof NGC 2808 is of original composition ([O/Na]=0.40),\nand 35% is of extremely-processed composition ([O/Na]=1.40), ejected from either AGB stars or massive stars.\nThe latter material is mixed with 35% of the former to\nvarious degrees and forms low-mass stars (the currently\nsurviving 70% stars of mixed composition), while the remaining 30% of the unprocessed material forms directly\nstars with the original composition. This scenario puts relatively mild constraints on the initial mass function, but\nextreme ones on the nucleosynthesis, since it requires all\nmaterial ejected by the presumed sources (AGB or massive stars) to have [O/Na]=\u20131.40. Percentages refer to the\ntotal mass of low-mass stars of NGC 2808 (those still surviving today).\nof the processed ejecta mass to the mass of stars with\noriginal composition in the low-mass range. In Scenario\nI, this ratio is 2.33 (=70/30), whereas in Scenario II it is\nmuch lower, only 0.54 (=35/65). Of course, this difference\nstems from the different assumptions on the composition\nof the ejecta: processed to various degrees in Scenario I vs\nextremely-processed in Scenario II.\nIn the next section we explore the constraints imposed\non the stellar IMF by the ratio mass(ejecta)/mass(lowmass stars) infered from our previous analysis.\n\n4. Constraining the IMF of the polluting stars in\nNGC 2808\n4.1. The IMF in Globular Clusters\nGlobular clusters provide, in principle, an ideal sample for\nan accurate evaluation of the stellar initial mass function\n(IMF) in the mass range M \u22640.8 M\u2299 and down to the Hburning limit. Indeed, they are composed of stars with the\nsame age, well determined distances and small variations\nin chemical composition (except for elements affected by\nH-burning) or in extinction within a cluster; moreover,\nthe fraction of binary stars outside the cluster core is less\nthan 15% (e.g. Rubenstein and Bailyn 1999) and affects\n\n\f8\n\nN. Prantzos and C. Charbonnel: Self-enrichment and the IMF of globular clusters\n\nlittle the determination of the luminosity function. Once\nthe luminosity function is established, the existence of accurate stellar evolutionary models (reproducing well the\nobserved color-magnitude diagrams of clusters with metalicities [Fe/H]<\u20131, e.g. Pulone et al. 1998) allows one to\nderive straightforwardly the IMF of low-mass stars.\nThe major potential problem in that enterprise is that\nformally, what we are measuring is the present-day mass\nfunction. This could differ from the IMF because of the\ndynamical evolution of the cluster, which may be both of\ninternal and external origin: internal, due to relaxation of\nthe N-body system towards energy equipartition, by expelling less massive bodies towards the periphery of the\ncluster and accumulating massive ones in the center; and\nexternal, due to tidal interactions with the Galactic potential (or molecular clouds, other clusters etc.), which\nmay result in the loss of the less massive bodies. Both effects lead to mass segregation of stars in space and time.\nParesce & de Marchi (2000, hereafter PdM00) found that\nthe effects of mass segregation alter the stellar mass function both in the innermost regions (making it flatter than\nthe IMF) and in those outside the half-light radius (making it steeper than the IMF); however, around the halflight radius, the effects of mass segregation are insignificant (see \u00a7 4 and Fig. 4 in PdM00).\nBy using HST measurements of the luminosity functions at (or just beyond) the half-light radius of a dozen\nglobular clusters, PdM00 found that the corresponding\nIMFs have the shape of a lognormal distribution characterized by a peak mass MC =0.33\u00b10.03 M\u2299 and a standard deviation \u03c3=0.34\u00b10.045. Their measurements cover\nthe mass range 0.09-0.7 M\u2299 , but we shall assume here that\nthe derived IMF shape is valid up to the turn-off mass of\n\u223c12 Gyr globular clusters, i.e. up to \u223c0.8 M\u2299 . We assume\nthen that in the mass range of low-mass stars (0.1-0.8 M\u2299 )\nthe IMF is of the form\n1\ndN\n\u221d\n\u03a6(M ) =\ndM\n2M\n\n\u0012\n\nlog(M/MC )\n\u03c3\n\n\u00132\n\n(7)\n\nwith values of MC and \u03c3 given in the previous paragraph.\nThe IMF of more massive stars (living less than 12 Gyr)\nis not observable in globular clusters, but it is measured\nin young clusters, where it is found that it can well be\napproximated by a power-law of the form\n\u03a6(M ) \u221d M \u2212(1+X)\n\n(8)\n\nwith X=1.35 being the \"classical\" Salpeter (1955) value.\nAs discussed in Kroupa (2002 and references therein) the\nSalpeter value fits extremely well the available data over a\nwild range of cluster masses and in different galaxies, and\nwith a dispersion of about 0.35, i.e. X=1.35\u00b10.35.\n5\n\nThis agrees well with various studies (Zinnecker 1984,\nAdams & Fatuzzo 1996, Elmegreen 1999) which show that one\nwould expect a log-normal form for the IMF if the number\nof independent parameters governing the fragmentation of a\nproto-stellar cloud is large enough (>5).\n\nFig. 6.

Mass of long lived stars, ejecta and residues\nA couple of other interesting quantities appear also in\nFig. 6. The mass fraction in the form of stars heavier than\na mass M is\nZ 100\nS(M ) =\nM \u2032 \u03a6(M \u2032 ) dM \u2032\n(10)\nM\n\nwhere, by definition, S(0.1)=1. Flat IMFs have a larger\nfraction of their mass in heavy stars, and a correspondingly smaller fraction in low-mass stars, than IMFs with\na steep slope (see middle panel in Fig. 6). We also present\n(bottom panel in Fig. 6) the hereby defined Ejecta mass\nfraction\nZ 100\nE(M ) =\n\u03b5(M \u2032 ) \u03a6(M \u2032 ) dM \u2032\n(11)\nM\n\nwhere \u03b5(M ) is defined as the part (in M\u2299 ) of the star\nthat is processed through H-burning only and is returned\nto the ISM. Even with the help of detailed stellar models\nit is difficult to have precise values for \u03b5(M ), since those\nvalues depend on several poorly known at present ingredients, like e.g. mixing criteria, mass loss rates, etc. In this\nwork, we choose to deliberately maximise the amount of\nH-processed ejecta from each star, in order to obtain upper limits to the slope of the corresponding IMF. For that\npurpose, we adopt the following \u03b5(M ) relations:\n\u03b5(M ) = M \u2212 MRes (M )\n\n(M < 9 M\u2299 )\n\n(12)\n\n\u03b5(M ) = M \u2212 MHe (M )\n\n(M > 9 M\u2299 )\n\n(13)\n\nwhere MRes is the mass of the residue (white dwarf for\nM<9 M\u2299 , neutron star or black hole otherwise) and MHe\nis the mass of the H-exhausted core of the star. This choice\nobviously maximizes the mass of the H-processed ejecta\nbecause it assumes that:\n- In intermediate mass stars, all the mass outside the\nwhite dwarf remnant is processed exclusively through Hburning: in reality, part of that mass is processed in the\nHe-burning shell, but we assume here that this is negligible.\n- In massive stars, all the mass outside the He-core\nis processed through H-burning; in reality, part of that\nmass is not processed at all (i.e. it is ejected with its original composition by the early stellar wind), while another\npart (close to the He-core) is contaminated by He-burning\nproducts; again, we assume those parts to be negligible,\nin order to maximize the mass of the H-processed ejecta.\nIn Fig. 7 we display the adopted \u03b5(M ) (from Eqs. 12\nand 13), as well as MRes , which is given from the relations:\n0.446 + 0.106 M\nMRes (M ) =\n\n1.5 M\u2299\n3 M\u2299\n\n(M < 9 M\u2299 )\n\n(10 < M/M\u2299 < 25)\n\n(14)\n\n(M > 25 M\u2299 )\n\nThe white dwarf vs. initial mass relation for M<9 M\u2299\nis from Iben & Tutukov (1984); it is assumed that stars\n\nFig. 7.

The dotted line indicates the initial stellar mass, while the aereas within thick\ncurves represent the H-processed ejecta that may contribute to the self-enrichment of globular clusters; the indicated amount is clearly an overestimate (see text).\nin the 10-25 M\u2299 range produce neutron stars of 1.5 M\u2299 ,\nwhile more massive ones produce black holes of 3 M\u2299 ( the\nmass of the neutron star or the black hole affects little the\nresults discussed hereafter, as far as it remains below the\nmass of the He-core, which is a reasonable assumption).\nThe ejecta mass fraction E(M ) for the two IMFs A\nand B appear in the bottom panel of Fig.6. Flat IMFs\nhave larger ejecta mass fractions than IMFs with steeper\nslope. Finally, in a similar way, the mass fraction locked\nin residues is calculated as\nZ 100\nR(M ) =\nMRes (M \u2032 ) \u03a6(M \u2032 ) dM \u2032\n(15)\nM\n\nFrom the defining equations (9) to (15) one may calculate\nany quantity of interest for a given IMF, e.g. the mass\nlocked in low-mass stars (in the range 0.1-0.8 M\u2299 ) still\nsurviving today is\nS(0.1 \u2212 0.8) = S(0.1) \u2212 S(0.8)\n\n(16)\n\nwhile the ejecta mass fraction of stars in the 4 to 9 M\u2299\nrange is\nE(4 \u2212 9) = E(4) \u2212 E(9)\n\n(17)\n\nand similar relations hold for e.g. the mass of residues.\nFour quantities of interest, calculated along the previous lines for all the IMFs studied here, are plotted in Fig. 8\n(top panel) as a function of the slope X of the M >0.8\n\n\f10\n\nN.

Constraints on the IMF of NGC 2808\nArmed with those numbers one may now explore the implications for NGC 2808 in the framework of the selfenrichment scenario. In the middle panel of Fig. 8 is plotted the ratio of the H-processed ejecta mass to the mass\nlocked in low-mass stars of the original IMF (stars that\nstill survive today) vs the slope X. Two cases are considered, namely that the ejecta originate either from massive\nstars (with mass 10-100 M\u2299 ) or from intermediate mass\nstars (AGBs of 4-9 M\u2299 ). Except for the steepest IMFs,\nthe former ratio is always larger than the latter (since the\nejecta mass of 10-100 M\u2299 is larger than the ejecta mass\nof 4-9 M\u2299 ). Of course, restraining the mass range of massive stars that could contribute to the H-processed ejecta\n(assuming e.g. that only stars in the 30-100 M\u2299 range develop sufficiently high temperatures for the operation of\nNe-Na or Mg-Al cycles) or assuming a smaller mass for the\nprocessed envelopes of massive stars (instead of the Eq. 13\nadopted here) would reduce accordingly the ejecta mass\nfraction of massive stars and would bring down the corresponding curves in Fig. 8 (top and middle panels). The\nsame of course holds for the contribution of AGBs, which\ncould well be smaller than assumed here (for instance, if\nthe mass of their H-processed ejecta is less than assumed\nin Eq. 12). Thus, the results presented in the middle panel\nof Fig. 8 should clearly be considered only as upper limits\nto what AGBs or massive stars might do. In actual reality,\nall curves involving ejecta E in the top and middle panels\nof Fig. 8 should be shifted downwards.\nThose theoretical results are compared to the observationally inferred requirements for NGC 2808, for both\n\nFig. 8.

(7) is always assumed. Letters\nA and B denote the results for the IMFs used in Fig. 6.\nMiddle: Ratio of ejecta mass (of either 4-9 M\u2299 or 10-100\nM\u2299 stars) to the mass of low-mass stars S(0.1-0.8) for each\nof the IMFs of our study. Note that S represents stars (or\nmaterial) of original (unprocessed) composition only. The\ntwo horizontal lines correspond to the constraints imposed\nby the analysis of Sec. 2.2 and Figs. 2 and 3, according to\nScenarios I (dashed) and II (dotted), respectively. Bottom:\nRatio of residue mass to the total mass of low-mass stars\nsurviving today, for each one of the studied IMFs. The\ntotal mass is the sum of the stars formed from original\n(unprocessed) material plus those formed from the ejecta\nof either AGBs (4-9 M\u2299 ) or massive stars (10-100 M\u2299 ).\n\nScenarios I and II in Fig. 8 (middle panel). As found in \u00a7 3,\nScenario I requires a ratio of H-processed ejecta to mass in\nlow-mass stars with original composition of 70/30=2.33,\nwhile Scenario II requires a smaller ratio, of 35/65=0.54.\nAs can be seen from Fig. 8 (middle panel), the require-\n\n\fN. Prantzos and C. Charbonnel: Self-enrichment and the IMF of globular clusters\n\nment of Scenario I is satisfied only for slopes X < 0.8\nin the case of massive stars and X < 0.15 for the massive AGBs. The requirement of Scenario II is satisfied for\nX < 1.25 in the former case and for X < 0.95 in the latter. IMFs with the standard slope X=1.35 fail to satisfy\nobservational requirements by a factor of 2 in our Scenario\nII and by a factor of 10 in our Scenario I.\nA diagram such as the one in the middle panel of\nFig. 8 offers, in principle, a way to determine the slope\nof the high mass (>0.8 M\u2299 ) IMF of a globular cluster\nwith a measured abundance distribution, as NGC 2808.\nHowever, this determination is made in the framework of\nmodels with extreme assumptions about both the polluter\nejecta and their mixing with the pristine gas. In Sec. 5 we\ndiscuss these assumptions and we conclude that, in a realistic scenario, the IMF should be much flatter (i.e. X\nshould be much smaller) than determined in the middle\npanel of Fig. 8. Still, it will be model dependent since the\nnecessary ingredients (amount and composition of ejecta\nand degree of their mixing with the ISM) cannot be constrained independently at present.\nAt this point, it should be noted that the IMF\nmay affect critically the fate of a dense stellar cluster.\nSimulations of the dynamical evolution of GCs including\nthe effects of tidal stripping and of mass loss from stellar\nevolution show indeed that a flat mass spectrum speeds\nup the cluster disruption (e.g., Joshi et al. 2001, Giersz\n2001). This potential problem is alleviated in the present\nself-enrichment scenario, because the mass lost by the polluters is assumed to be incorporated in low-mass stars\nof the cluster. Nevertheless the self-enrichment scenario\nneeds to be tested quantitatively with realistic dynamical\nevolution models.\nOne way to constrain further the various scenarios is\nby searching for signatures left over in the form of stellar\nresidues. This is the subject of the next section.\n\n4.4. Consequences for the amount of stellar residues\nIn the bottom panel of Fig. 8 we explore the consequences\nof our different assumptions for the mass of \"dark objects\"\nin NGC 2808, namely residues of stars with initial mass\nM>0.8 M\u2299 . Their mass (determined by the assumed IMF\nfrom Eq. (14) and given in Fig. 8, top panel) is compared\nto the total mass of long-lived stars (M\u22640.8 M\u2299 ) of the\ncluster. The total mass is the sum of the original (unpolluted) low-mass stars S(0.1 \u2212 0.8) plus the polluted ones.\nIf the polluted long-lived stars originate from the ejecta\nof 10-100 M\u2299 stars (mass E(10 \u2212 100)), the sum increases\nconsiderably at low X values and the ratio of residues\nto stars decreases in consequence. On the contrary, if the\npolluted long-lived stars originate from the ejecta of 4-9\nM\u2299 stars (mass E(4 \u2212 9)), the sum decreases at low X\nand the mass of the residues becomes comparable to the\nmass of active stars today (especially in case of Scenario\nI). Thus, the mass ratio of residues to long lived stars depends sensitively on the assumption made about the mass\n\n11\n\nFig. 9. Top: Number of stars per unit solar mass, as a\nfunction of the slope X above the turn-off mass. The two\ncurves corerspond to long-lived stars (0.1-0.8 M\u2299 ) and\nto stars leaving behind white dwarfs (0.8-9 M\u2299 initially).\nMiddle: Number ratio of white dwarfs to long-lived stars\nfor the various IMFs studied in this work. The two solid\ncurves correspond to the cases where the polluters are\nAGBs (asterisks) and WMS (filled circles), respectively\n(as in the middle and bottom panels of Fig. 8). The dotted\ncurve is obtained by simply dividing the two curves of the\ntop panel, i.e. no creation of 0.1-0.8 M\u2299 stars by the ejecta\nof polluters (self-enrichment) is considered. The horizontal\ndashed line represents the results of the study of Richer et\nal. (2002) for M4. Bottom: Curves as in the middle panel,\nbut for mass ratios instead of number ratios; also, the\nresidues include not only white dwarfs (as in the middle\npanel) but also neutron stars and black holes.\n\nrange of the polluters, especially for flat IMFs (such as\nthose required to explain the abundance distribution of\nNGC 2808, and presumably of other clusters as well).\nUnfortunately, such a ratio has not been determined\nin the case of NGC 2808. However, in the case of the\ncluster M4 (another mildly metal-poor GC with [Fe/H]\u223c1.08; Ivans et al. 2001), the number ratio of white dwarfs\nto long lived stars has been determined by Richer et al.\n(2002, hereafter RBF02). They used HST observations of\nthat cluster to probe its luminosity function (LF) down\n\n\f12\n\nN. Prantzos and C. Charbonnel: Self-enrichment and the IMF of globular clusters\n\nto the H-burning limit (\u223c0.09 M\u2299 ). Using stellar models\nof low-mass and low-metallicity stars (which still suffer\nfrom important uncertainties) they transformed the LF\ninto a MF and concluded that the latter can be fitted by\na power-law of slope \u03b1=0.75 (or X=\u03b1-1=\u20130.25 in the notation adopted here) in the mass range 0.09-0.65 M\u2299 . In a\nsubsequent work, however, de Marchi et al. (2004) argued\nthat the use of more appropriate stellar models leads to a\nmass function similar to the one that PdM00 had determined for 12 GCs (Eq. 7). In the following we adopt this\nlow-mass MF (the same used throughout our paper) also\nfor M4.\nBy applying substantial completeness corrections to\ntheir sample, RBF02 derived the number of main sequence\nstars in the range 0.09 to 0.65 M\u2299 and the number of\nwhite dwarfs from progenitor stars in the range 0.8 to\n8 M\u2299 : they are, respectively, NMS (0.09-0.65)=570 and\nNW D =602. The number ratio of white dwarfs to long lived\nstars is thus \u223c1. It should be stressed that these numbers are determined essentially by the applied completeness corrections, rather than by the observations (see Fig.\n3, top panel, in RBF02).\nRBF02 find that a single slope power-law IMF, with\n\u03b1=1.05 (or X=0.05), i.e. the steepest slope compatible with their data, can accomodate this large ratio of\nNW D /NMS . They assume, of course, that both the observed MS stars and the WDs result from the original\n(first generation) IMF of the cluster, i.e they do not consider long-lived stars formed from the ejecta of the first\ngeneration. Since M4 is a cluster with observed O vs Na\nanticorrelation (Ivans et al. 1999, 2001), their IMF determination has a meaning only under the assumption that\nthe observed anticorrelation is due to internal evolution\nand not to self-enrichment.\nFor a composite IMF, as the one adopted here (with\nPdM00 IMF below the turn-off mass of 0.8 M\u2299 and a power\nlaw above it) we find that, in the internal evolution scenario, a slope X=\u20130.3 above the turn-off mass is required\nto reproduce the derived NW D /NMS \u223c1 (see dotted curve\nin the middle panel of Fig. 9).\nSomewhat surprisingly, in the self-enrichment scenario\n(solid curves in the middle and bottom panels of Fig. 9)\nsuch a high NW D /NMS ratio is never obtained: values\naround 0.2 are obtained if the polluters are assumed to\nbe AGBs and much lower ones if the polluters are massive stars. This may appear paradoxical, since at small\nIMF slopes and in the case of AGBs as polluters, residues\ndominate long-lived stars by mass, as clearly seen in Fig.\n9 (bottom panel). This apparent discrepancy is due to the\nfact that the ejecta mass of a e.g. 4 M\u2299 star can give rise\nto a dozen or so low mass stars (\u223c0.3 M\u2299 ) of 2nd generation; thus, the resulting number ratio between WDs\nand long-lived stars is much lower than the corresponding\nmass ratio between WDs and ejecta. Interestingly, in the\ncase of internal evolution (implicitly adopted in RBF02),\nthe residues should completely dominate by mass the long\nlived stars in M4, by a factor of 10, as can be seen in the\nbottom panel of Fig. 9 (dashed curve); this is due to the\n\nfact that each residue (white dwarf, neutron star or black\nhole) is several times more massive than a typical lowmass star.\nThe low number ratio of white dwarfs over low mass\nstars obtained in our self-enrichment scenarios (lower than\nderived in M4), does not necessarily point to a fatal flaw\nfor those scenarios. It may well be that the ejecta mass\n(and the resulting number of second generation stars) is\nsmaller than assumed here, in which case a ratio closer to\nthe observed one will be obtained. Such a reduced ejecta\nmass is, in fact, quite plausible (see discussion in \u00a7 5.1).\n\n4.5. Constraints from the Horizontal Branch in\nNGC2808\nA determination of the polluter IMF on the basis of star\ncounts has been also attempted recently by D'Antona and\nCaloi (2004), who noted that AGB winds are heliumenriched (mainly as a consequence of the second dredgeup; Ventura et al. 2001). The second generation stars\nformed from AGB ejecta should then have a higher helium content than the first generation stars, which were\nborn with the primordial cluster helium abundance. This\ndifference in helium may alter substantially their advanced\nevolution.\nD'Antona et al. (2002) evaluated the impact of a\nspread in helium within the low-mass star population on a\nGC color-magnitude diagram and discussed the evolutionary properties of GC stars in which variations of the initial\nhelium are allowed. They showed that within reasonable\nlimits (Y varying between 0.24 for the proto-cluster abundance and 0.28 for the most polluted stars), the impact on\nthe main sequence, turnoff and RGB would be small and\nundetectable observationally. Also, the horizontal branch\nluminosity appears to be only slightly affected. As a consequence the age determination should be modified only in\na limited way. However the differences on the morphology\nof the horizontal branch would be noticeable; in particular\nthe He enrichment could play a role in the formation of\nblue tails.\nFollowing this idea, D'Antona & Caloi (2004, hereafter\nDC04) studied in detail the morphology of the horizontal branch of NGC 2808 which is composed of two wellseparated regions : a red clump, and an extended blue\ntail starting from the blue side of the RR Lyrae gap and\nreaching below the cluster turn-off (Bedin et al. 2000 and\nreferences therein). DC04 showed that the dichotomy of\nthe horizontal branch of NGC 2808 could be reproduced\nby assuming different helium contents for the clump and\nblue HB stars, and argued that this unveils the signature of two separate events of star formation in the early\ncluster evolution. Within their self-enrichment framework\n(which is similar, but not identical, to our Scenario I),\nthe red clump stars belong to the first stellar generation\nformed with the original helium, while second-generation\nstars born directly from the ejecta of AGB stars of various\nmasses (and thus with various He-enrichments) populate\n\n\fN. Prantzos and C. Charbonnel: Self-enrichment and the IMF of globular clusters\n\nthe blue part of the HB. The lack of stars in the RR Lyrae\nregion is attributed to the gap in helium between the two\nstellar generations 6 .\nDC04 further explored the implications of their hypothesis by deriving the IMF of the first stellar generation\nbased on star counts along the HB of NGC 2808. In order\nto explain the number of HB blue stars, they adopt a relation between the progenitor AGB mass and the helium\ncontent of their ejecta (based on stellar models) and they\nderive a relatively flat IMF, with X \u223c 0. This value is\nvery close to the upper limit we derived in \u00a7 4.3 for AGB\nstars being the polluters within Scenario I.\nHelium enrichment is a natural outcome of AGB models. However the results of DC04 are extremely modeldependent; they rely in particular on a simple linear relation between the average helium content in the ejecta\nand the progenitor mass, require a fine-tuning of the\nmass loss on the RGB, and depend on delicate transformations between the theoretical and observational plane.\nAdditionaly, other phenomena may intervene in the building of the color-magnitude diagram morphology of a GC\n(mass loss processes, stellar multiplicity, stellar rotation,\ndynamical effects) which should be ultimately taken into\naccount in such an analysis (see e.g., Sosin et al. 1997,\nCastellani et al 2006 and references therein).\nClaims of supporting evidence for the presence of\nhelium-rich populations in GCs were recently obtained\nthrough the detailed analysis of various color-magnitude\ndiagram features (e.g., Lee et al. 2005 and references\ntherein). This type of analysis brings new support to the\nself-enrichment hypothesis, but sheds no light to the nature of the polluters, since both AGBs and WMS are important He producers, as discussed in \u00a7 5.\nThe results presented and discussed in this section illustrate how deep counting observations of GC stars may\nbe used to constrain the massive star (=polluter) IMF\nof the GCs, in the framework of the self-enrichment scenario. It is true that the simplifying assumptions made in\nour work (upper mass limits for the IMFs of the first - 100\nM\u2299 - and second - 0.8 M\u2299 - stellar generations, same form\nfor the low mass part of the IMFs in both stellar generations) are not unique, and a degenerate set of constraints\n6\n\nD'Antona et al. (2005) pushed further the analysis of the\nCMD of NGC 2808. They proposed that the main sequence\nwidth of this GC can be explained by the presence of three\nstellar generations born with different helium contents : Y \u223c\n0.24 (first generation born with proto-cluster abundance), Y \u223c\n0.4 (second generation, in chronological order, born from the\nwinds of the most massive AGBs of the first generation), and\nY \u223c 0.26 - 0.29 (third generation born from the ejecta from\nless massive AGBs of the first generation). In their scenario,\nlate binary Type II supernova explosions are invoked to explain\nwhy there are no stars formed with Y between 0.29 and 0.4. We\nnote that the third stellar generation should be contaminated\nby He-burning products (C in particular) and by s-elements\nejected by low-mass AGBs which undergo third dredge-up but\nno HBB. Such abundance variations have not been discovered\nyet. See \u00a7 1 and our discussion in \u00a7 5.2.1.\n\n13\n\nwould be obtained in a detailed analysis. However, with\nlarger observational data sets available for a given cluster (including e.g. abundance distributions for several elements, number counts of white dwarfs and low mass stars\n- including those of the horizontal branch -, as well as dynamical determination of the baryonic mass of the cluster\netc.) and with improved theoretical understanding of stellar nucleosynthesis issues (e.g. amount and composition of\nejecta) this degeneracy will ultimately be lifted.\n\n5. Discussion\nToday, there is not a unique, neither a well-defined, nor\neven a fully self-consistent scenario for the self-enrichment\nof globular clusters. The most commonly invoked one assumes that the H-processed ejecta of massive AGB stars\nof a first stellar generation (of unspecified, but presumably\nflatter than normal, IMF) form a second stellar generation\n(of equally unspecified IMF) and of appropriate chemical composition (i.e. in agreement with observed O/Fe vs\nNa/Fe ratios in GC stars). Most of the theoretical effort\nup to now has been devoted in trying to reproduce the\nobserved O vs Na or Mg vs Al relations from the nucleosynthesis point of view (see references in Charbonnel\n2005).\nIn this section, we discuss several aspects of the two\nself-enrichment Scenarios (I and II) which are sketched\nin \u00a7 3 and which involve not only AGBs but also winds\nof massive stars as alternative sources of the chemically\npolluted material.\n\n5.1. The mass and composition of the polluting ejecta\nWe start by noting that any scenario of that kind necessarily involves assumptions about three quantities:\na) the IMF (mass limits and shape) of the first stellar generation and, when it exists, of the second one also\n(there are two generations in our Scenario I but only one\nin our Scenario II);\nb) the amount and composition of the stellar ejecta\nthat contribute to the formation of the contaminated\nstars, as well as the mass range of the polluting stars;\nc) the amount of unprocessed gas, which is mixed to\nvarious degrees with the processed ejecta (it is equal to\nzero in our Scenario I).\nFrom those quantities, only the second can be evaluated, in principle, from stellar nucleosynthesis calculations; the other two can only be guessed at, or constrained,\nby a combination of theory and observations.\nSince we lack, at present, the required input for item\n(b)7 we had to make here some assumptions. We assumed\n7\nAs mentioned in \u00a7 3, the yields of massive AGB stars have\nbeen computed recently by several groups in the context of\nthe self-enrichment hypothesis. Nevertheless, the predictions\nremain highly uncertain (mainly because they depend on the\nmodelling of complex physical mechanisms such as HBB, third\ndredge-up, convection, mass loss, rotation, ...) and none of the\n\n\f14\n\nN.

Obviously, any other\nassumption reducing the amount of the processed ejecta\nwould result in IMFs even flatter than those found in \u00a7 4\n(all other things being kept the same). As discussed already in \u00a7 4.2, a smaller amount of H-processed ejecta\nthan assumed here is much more plausible physically, for\nboth AGB stars and massive stars.\nWe also made two different assumptions about the\ncomposition of the ejecta, namely that they are processed\nto various degrees (Scenario I) or to an extreme degree\n(Scenario II). Obviously, the latter assumption is utterly\nimplausible, and it was used only to place absolute lower\nlimits to the slope of the polluter IMF. Indeed, it is hard to\nconceive that the whole envelope of all the polluters (AGBs\nor massive stars) is processed to such an extreme degree\n([O/Na]=-1.4); this may happen at some point of the evolution of some of the polluters, but it cannot characterize\nto totality of the envelope evolution, nor the whole mass\nrange of the polluters. Thus, the lower horizontal line of\nScenario II (middle panel of Fig. 8) is an extreme and unrealistic lower limit; the upper line of Scenario I is more\nrealistic in that respect. Still, observations suggest that it\ncannot be true, either.\nIndeed, Pasquini et al. (2005) report the presence of\nLi in 9 turn-off stars of the intermediate metallicity globular cluster NGC 6752 ([Fe/H]=\u20131.4), a cluster which displays the anticorrelation of O vs. Na. The Li abundance\nin NGC 6752 correlates with the one of O and anticorrelates with those of Na and N. The maximum Li abundance\ncorresponds to stars with [O/Fe]\u223c0.4, i.e. to stars formed\nfrom unprocessed material with composition similar to the\none of field stars. It is no surprise then that the abundance\nof Li in those stars (log(Li/H)\u223c\u20139.6) is at the level of the\nso-called \"Spite plateau\" observed in field halo stars (e.g.,\nCharbonnel & Primas 2005). On the other hand, the lowest detected Li values are about 3 times smaller and are\nfound in stars with very low [O/Na]\u223c\u20131.1 in NGC 6752.\nThe presence of so much Li (only within a factor\nof three below the plateau level) in stars of modified\ncomposition in NGC 6752 clearly is at odds with our\nScenario I: if such stars are made exclusively from the Hprocessed ejecta of some class of polluters (as assumed in\nour Scenario I), then no Li should be present there, in view\nof the nuclear fragility of that element. And even if one\nassumes that some fresh Li can be produced in H-burning\n(and ejected before subsequent destruction) through the\n\"Cameron-Fowler (1971) mechanism\", it is utterely implausible that the abundance of this new Li is almost\nas high as the \"Spite plateau\". The most natural way\nto explain the presence of Li in the O-depleted stars of\nNGC 6752 is by assuming that those stars are formed from\n\na mixture of nuclearly processed material with material of\nnormal composition, as in our Scenario II (Prantzos &\nCharbonnel, in preparation).\nFinally, we note that in both Scenarios I and II we assumed that, while the original IMF contained stars in the\nfull mass range of 0.1 to 100 M\u2299 , the ejecta of the polluters\nformed only stars in the 0.1-0.8 M\u2299 range, i.e. still alive\ntoday. This assumption has no physical justification and\nwas only made in order to maximize the ratio of ejecta\nto live stars, in the same spirit with the other assumptions discussed in this section. Assuming that the ejecta\nformed stars in the full 0.1-100 M\u2299 range would obviously\nlead to flatter IMFs in order to satisfy the observational\nrequirements8 .\nWe conclude then that both our Scenarios I and II are\ngrossly underestimating \"reality\", in the framework of the\nself-enrichment hypothesis for globular clusters. A realistic\nscenario should invoke both ejecta with varying composition (as in Scenario I, more realistic on nucleosynthesis\ngrounds) and mixture of those ejecta with pristine gas (as\nin Scenario II, to account for Li observations); this implies\nthat the horizontal \"observational\" lines in Fig. 8 (middle\npanel) should be replaced by a line lying above the one\nof Scenario I. Also, a realistic scenario should consider an\namount of ejecta considerably lower than the (deliberate)\noverestimate we made in Eqs. (12) and (13); consequently,\nthe curves of Fig. 8 (middle panel) should shift downwards, as discussed in \u00a7 4.3. Overall, in a realistic scenario\nthe slope X of the polluter IMF should be much smaller\nthan derived in \u00a7 4.3 and certainly much smaller than 0\nin case the polluters are AGB stars. In other terms, an\nextremely flat IMF should be necessary to satisfy the constraints imposed by the abundance distribution of Fig. 2.\nIn such a case, by extrapolating the trends obtained in\nthe lower panel of Fig. 8 (towards the left) one sees that:\n- if the polluters are AGB stars, the mass of the cluster\ntoday should be completely dominated by residues (by a\nfactor of several);\n- on the contrary, if the polluters are massive stars, the\ntotal mass of the residues today would be much smaller\nthan the mass of live stars in the cluster.\nWith those implications in mind, we now take a closer\nlook at the self-enrichment scenario, for each one of the\ntwo invoked classes of polluters.\n\n5.2. Polluters: AGBs vs. WMS\n5.2.1. AGBs?\nAccording to a commonly held idea, the peculiar chemical composition of GC stars results from pollution by the\nejecta of AGB stars, massive enough (4-9 M\u2299 ) as to develop HBB in their envelopes. Such stars evolve in time\n8\n\npresent models does properly account for the O-Na and MgAl anticorrelations yet. On the other hand, models of rotating\nmassive stars with the appropriate initial composition will soon\nbe available (Decressin et al. in preparation).\n\nAssuming that the second (\"polluted\") generation of stars\ncontained its own massive and fast evolving \"polluters\" (the\nejecta of which would give rise to a third generation, and so\non) would make the whole problem much more complex, and\nit would invalidate the analysis made here.\n\n\fN. Prantzos and C. Charbonnel: Self-enrichment and the IMF of globular clusters\n\nscales of \u223c 20 to 150 Myr and release their ejecta at velocities v < 30 km/s (e.g., Loup et al. 1993), lower than the\nescape velocity from the cluster; the ejecta are trapped\nin the cluster and form new stars, either directly (our\nScenario I) or indirectly, after mixing to various degrees\nwith pristine material (our Scenario II, which accounts for\nthe Li observations, as argued in Sec. 5.1).\nIn our opinion, this idea suffers from several drawbacks\n(in addition to the problematic nucleosynthesis predictions of the current models discussed in \u00a7 3). In particular,\nit gives no satisfactory answer as to the roles of stars more\nmassive (M>9 M\u2299 ) and less massive (M< 4 M\u2299 ) than the\npresumed polluters.\n1) Stars more massive than 9 M\u2299 evolve on time scales\nlower than 20 Myr and are quite numerous (since a flat\nIMF is required in any case to account for the observed\nabundance distribution, as argued in this work). They\nrelease material processed through various nuclear burning stages, both through their winds (slow in the Main\nSequence, quite fast in the Wolf-Rayet stage) and through\nthe final stellar explosion as supernovae. A commonly\ngiven answer as to the fate of their ejecta is that the fast\nmoving supernova material (v >400 km/s even for the\ninnermost SN regions) escapes the system and leaves no\ntrace behind. On its way, it sweeps up the previously released wind ejecta, but also any ambient gas of pristine\ncomposition. Consequently, no original Li rich gas is left\nbehind to get subsequently mixed with the AGB ejecta.\nThe second (polluted) stellar generation should then be\nformed exclusively with AGB ejecta, which implies that\nAGBs should produce their own Li, at a level close to the\nSpite plateau. This is an extremely strong constraint on\nthe nucleosynthesis of AGB stars.\nAlternatively, one may argue that an insignificant\namount of nuclearly processed ejecta escapes the supernovae, the vast majority being trapped within a black hole;\nthis is an utterly implausible scenario, since neutron stars\nand pulsars are common in the Milky Way and there is no\nreason why massive stars in GCs would produce no such\nresidues.\nFinally, one might also invoke a peculiar IMF of the\nfirst stellar generation in GCs, lacking massive stars altogether. Such an ad hoc assumption, however, is not supported by any theoretical arguments or numerical simulation results.\n2) Stars in the mass range 2-4 M\u2299 evolve on timescales\nof 150 to 1000 Myr and release almost as much mass\nas those of 4-9 M\u2299 (depending on the assumed IMF: for\nX=0.15 we obtain E(2-4)=0.35 E(4-9)). Even if they do\nnot develop HBB in their envelopes, they go through the\nthird dredge-up phase; this brings He-burning products\n(in particular C) and s-elements to the surface, which are\nslowly released to the ISM. If new stars are formed from\nthese ejecta, C and s-elements excesses should be observed\nin GC stars, which is not the case. One then has to assume that the ejecta of 2 to 4 M\u2299 form no new stars, why\nthose of their slightly more massive sisters manage to do\nit very efficiently. Perhaps, on time scales >100 Myr tidal\n\n15\n\ninteractions of the GCs with the Galactic potential are\nable to remove most of the cluster gas (as well as part of\nits stars); still some ejecta should be left behind to form\nstars with C and s-elements excess. Until a consistent dynamical scenario is developed to account convincingly for\nthat point, we consider it to be one of the drawbacks of\nthe AGB scenario for the pollution of GCs.\n\n5.2.2. WMS?\nThe idea that WMS may be at the origin of some anomalies in the composition of GCs has been recently suggested\nby Norris (2004) and Maeder and Meynet (2006), in order to explain the blue main sequence of the cluster \u03c9\nCentauri: the high helium content of the stars of that sequence could originate from WMS, producing a large helium/metal ratio. Omega Cen is, however, a peculiar case,\nshowing a dispersion in its heavy metal content, unlike any\nother GC. If the polluters of GCs are indeed the winds of\nmassive stars, the scenario could run along the following\nlines:\nThe winds of those stars, rich with H-burning products\n(especially if the stars are rotating), are slowly released in\nthe ambient ISM and they push it, opening circumstellar\ncavities; they are finally mixed with pristine gas, still left\nover in the system after the formation of the first stellar generation. By reaching the walls of those cavities, the\nshock waves of the subsequent SN explosions induce the\nformation of new stars from this gas of mixed composition.\nThe hot SN ejecta inside the shock waves are expanding mainly along the cavities opened up previously by the\nmassive star winds, and they finally find their way out of\nthe cluster, escaping altogether the system. Thus, the stars\nwe now observe in the cluster are either of original composition, or of composition resulting from the mixture of\npristine gas with WMS. On longer timescales (>20 Myr)\nthe wind ejecta of lower mass stars (M<10 M\u2299 ) that do\nnot explode, are slowly released in the cluster. However,\nthey never form new stars, since there is no external agent\nto trigger condensation of that gas and to induce star formation. As discussed before, tidal interactions ultimately\nstrip that gas off the cluster.\nThe advantages of the WMS scenario are that: i) it\nmay \"naturally\" account for the formation of the second stellar generation with mixed composition, which is\ntriggered by the SN shock waves, and ii) it may also explain why no trace of the He-burning products of the third\ndredge-up (which certainly occurs in low-mass AGBs) is\nseen today in GC stars: these products, as well as those\nof HBB in more massive AGBs, are slowly released in a\nrarefied medium (since almost all of the gas of the system\nhas been swept up or condensed previously, after the passage of the shock waves); as a result, they never condense\nto form new stars (for lack of triggering agent) and they\nare ultimately removed from the cluster through tidal interactions.\n\n\f16\n\nN. Prantzos and C. Charbonnel: Self-enrichment and the IMF of globular clusters\n\nOf course, this novel scenario has also its potential\ndrawbacks. It assumes that WMS mix thoroughly with\npristine gas and that the subsequent shock wave triggers\nan efficient star formation in the mixture, while the SN\nejecta escape the system. One may, in fact, imagine the\nopposite situation, where the shock waves disperse the gas,\nor the SN ejecta mix with that gas (at least partially). At\nthe current stage of our knowledge, both alternatives are\npossible.\nThe WMS scenario sketched here is, admittedly, at a\nvery qualitative level (but no more than the scenario involving AGBs). It should be substantiated at least by nucleosynthesis calculations demonstrating that WMS can\nindeed provide the chemical composition required to explain the observations of abundances in GCs; such calculations are already performed and they will be presented\nelsewhere (Decressin et al. in preparation). We feel, however, that the WMS scenario opens very interesting perspectives for the understanding of the self-enrichment of\nGCs.\n\n6. Summary\nIn this work we study the constraints on the IMF of stars\nresponsible for the observed abundance anomalies in GCs,\nin the framework of the so-called self-enrichment scenario.\nWe stress again that, at present, there is not a unique, nor\na well-defined, nor even a self-consistent self-enrichment\nscenario for GCs. The parameter space is quite large and\ninvolves (at least) the IMF (mass limits and shape) of the\npolluter stars, the amount and composition of their ejecta,\nas well as the amount of unprocessed gas, which is mixed\nto various degrees with these ejecta in order to form the\nobserved contaminated low-mass stars.\nIn view of the many uncertainties related to the selfenrichment scenario, we explore in some detail several possibilities, but our study is far from being exhaustive in\nthat respect (\u00a7 3). In particular, we explore two different\ntypes of self-enrichment scenarios, differing in the composition of the polluter ejecta, i.e. the degree to which\nthe ejecta are contaminated by H-burning products: in\nScenario I, second generation stars are formed exclusively\nfrom ejecta processed at various degrees, while in Scenario\nII they are formed from extremely processed ejecta mixed\nto various degrees with pristine material. Also, we explore\ntwo different possibilities for the polluters, namely AGB\nstars (4-9 M\u2299 ) and WMS (>10 M\u2299 ), since both of them\ncan, in principle, release in the ISM H-burning products\nat slow velocities. In each case we assume that the amount\nof ejecta is as large as possible, in order to constrain the\npolluter IMF from one side.\nWe adopt a composite IMF (\u00a7 4.1) , with an observationally derived part in the mass range 0.1-0.8 M\u2299 (from\nPdM00) and a power-law for higher masses (i.e. for stars\nthat are extinguished today); our aim is to constrain the\nslope X of the power-law part of the IMF. For a concrete\nillustration of our method we chose NGC 2808, the GC\nfor which the largest sample of O and Na abundances is\n\npresently available. We derive the abundance distribution\nof O/Na in that cluster (\u00a7 2) and find that \u223c30% of its\nstars have a pristine composition, while the remaining 70%\nis contaminated to various degrees by H-burning products.\nWe then show how this contamination can be obtained\nquantitatively in the framework of our two self-enrichment\nscenarios and under the different assumptions made about\nthe mass range of the polluters (AGBs vs WMS). We find\nthat, in any case, the IMF of the polluters has to be flatter\nthan the standard present-day IMF (i.e. with the Salpeter\nslope X=1.35); the trend is more pronounced in Scenario\nI than in Scenario II, and also more pronounced in the\ncase of AGBs than in the case of WMS (\u00a7 4.3). However,\ndue the many uncertainties involved, it is impossible to\nmake a realistic quantitative prediction about the upper\nlimit of the slope X; in fact, we argue in \u00a7 5.1 that a\nrealistic scenario would lead to an IMF much flatter even\nthan those obtained in this work.\nWe note that an IMF with X <-0.4 (i.e. much flatter\nthan obtained here) was found in the work of Smith and\nNorris (1982) for GC 6752 and 47 TUC, in order to explain\nthe observed C depletion in the framework of the selfenrichment scenario. By using absolute abundances (and\nnot only abundance ratios, as in our work) Smith & Norris\n(1982) were also able to place an upper limit of 11 M\u2299 to\nthe IMF of the polluters. Clearly, such a work should be\nrepeated with updated stellar yields and a large base of\nspectroscopic data on as many elements as possible, in\norder to constrain the polluter IMF and even the validity\nof the various self-enrichment scenarios.\nWe find that the amount of stellar residues (both by\nmass and by number) present in the GC, depends sensitively on the slope of the adopted IMF and on the mass\nrange of the polluters; it provides then another potential\ndiscriminating test between the various possibilities. We\nillustrate this (\u00a7 4.4) by comparing our results to the number ratio (\u223c1) of white dwarfs to low-mass stars inferred\nin the cluster M4. We find that our results fall short of\nproducing such a large ratio, the discrepancy being more\nimportant in the case of WMS than in the case of AGBs.\nIn fact, taken at face value, our results might be interpreted as a complete failure of the self-enrichment scenario\n(and as an argument for the internal evolution scenario).\nWe argue, however, that this \"failure\" may be attributed\nto the extreme assumptions adopted here, and that more\nrealistic assumptions would produce results closer to the\nobservations.\nFinally, in \u00a7 5 we discuss the various assumptions made\nin our study. In particular, we comment on some problems associated (in our opinion) with AGBs, the most frequently invoked polluters of GCs (\u00a7 5.2.1). We also develop\nin some detail, and for the first time, a possible scenario\nfor the pollution of GCs by WMS, and we also invoke its\nown potential problems (\u00a7 5.2.2). We conclude that WMS\noffer an appealing alternative to AGBs as polluter candidates of GCs.\nOverall, our study shows that the self-enrichment\nscenario of GCs can be quantitatively tested, through\n\n\fN.
