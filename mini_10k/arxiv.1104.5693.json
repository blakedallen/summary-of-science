Theoretical models show that bars can\nerated by the University of California.\n\n1\n\n\fical models (see also Rautiainen et al. 2005),\npropose that bars in early Hubble type galaxies (those with high bulge to disk mass ratio)\nend near CR, whereas those in late type galaxies (with low bulge to disk mass ratio) may\nend near the ILR, where the spiral arms begin (Elmegreen & Elmegreen 1989). Nevertheless,\n\"slow\" rotating bars are not favored by the comparison of simulations and observations (Schwarz\n1984, 1985; Weiner et al. 2001; Dubinski et al.\n2009), probably implying that disks in barred\ngalaxies are maximal (Debattista & Sellwood\n2000). Buta & Zhang (2009) apply the potentialdensity phase-shift method (Zhang & Buta 2007)\nto a near-infrared (NIR) subsample of the Ohio\nState University Bright Galaxy Survey (OSUBGS, Eskridge et al. 2002), and also fail to find\nevidence of the existence of \"slow\" bars.\nSellwood & Sparke (1988) propose that multiple pattern speeds may be common (see also\nSellwood & Wilkinson 1993; Patsis et al. 2009),\nsuch that for some barred galaxies two corotation\nradii, one belonging to the bar and the other to\nthe spiral arms, may occur simultaneously in the\ndisk. This would imply that spiral arms are connected to bars only transitorily. The possibility\nalso exists that the bar and bulge mask the spiral\narms at small radii; the arms would only start to\nbe seen near the bar's end, creating the impression\nof a physical connection where there is none. Unsharp masking and/or Fourier-based methods can\nbe used to search for spiral and bar perturbations\nin the inner parts of galaxies. However, ring-like\nfeatures at the end of the bar may interfere with\nthe unambiguous identification of a physical connection between bar and arms in some objects.\nRautiainen & Salo (1999) perform simulations\nthat confirm the scenario advanced by Sellwood & Sparke\n(1988). They also find cases, however, where\nthe bar and spiral rotate with the same pattern\nspeed, as well as other cases where the bar and\nspiral patterns have different speeds but coupled\nresonances (Tagger et al. 1987; Masset & Tagger\n1997). In these cases, the bar's CR may overlap\nwith the spiral 4:1 resonance or ILR, and the bar\nand spiral arms are indeed connected. Various\nsimultaneous spiral modes are also possible. According to Buta & Zhang (2009), barred galaxies\ncan have \"fast\" bars (CR at 1 to 1.4 times the\nbar extent), and spirals rotating at the same or\n\nbe formed as part of the natural development of\nthe system (Athanassoula 2009). On the classical view, bars are mainly supported by elongated orbits (called x1 orbits) along the bar major\naxis (Skokos et al. 2002, and references therein).\nChaotic orbits, however, can also support bars\nin disk galaxies (see, e.g., Voglis et al. 2006a;\nHarsoula et al. 2011). Given that the stars that\nmake up bars remain most of the time within\nthem, bars, unlike spiral arms, are not density\nwaves (Sparke & Gallagher 2007; see also \u00a7 5.3).\nBars, however, can also be considered as long-lived\nwaves and \"normal\" modes in the disk, possibly\ndriving spiral structure (Buta & Combes 1996).\nIt has been predicted that single large-scale\n(\"fast\") bars commonly end inside corotation (CR,\nContopoulos 1980; Contopoulos & Papayannopoulos\n1980; Sellwood 1981), also called Lagrange radius (see, e.g., Sellwood & Wilkinson 1993). This\nprediction has also been corroborated by observations (e.g., Merrifield & Kuijken 1995; Gerssen et al.\n1999; Debattista et al. 2002; Aguerri et al. 2003;\nFathi et al. 2009; Gabbasov et al. 2009; Corsini\n2010). From these studies, nonetheless, it can also\nbe inferred that the bar's corotation radius1 lies\nbetween 1 and 1.4 times the bar's semimajor axis,\nand not exactly where the bar ends (Aguerri et al.\n2003; Buta & Zhang 2009; Elmegreen 1996). This\nmay explain why some galaxies (e.g., NGC 1300,\nNGC 1365, NGC 5236) show dust lanes on the\ninside of the spiral arms and HII regions on the\noutside. If bar and arms have the same pattern\nspeed, this makes sense only while spirals lie within\ncorotation (Roberts et al. 1979). A crossing of the\ndust lanes from the inside to the outside of the\narms, marking the corotation position, or an arm\nbifurcation2 are also sometimes observed.\nAnother theory postulates that \"slow bars\"3\nactually end near the inner Lindblad resonance\n(ILR; Pasha & Polyachenko 1994), and that they\nare formed by the alignment of elongated and oscillating orbits along the potential (Lynden-Bell\n1979).\nCombes & Elmegreen (1993) on the\nother hand, based on the results of numer1\n\nCeverino & Klypin (2007) show that corotation particles\nare actually located in a \"wide\" ring.\n2 Bifurcations are not a unique signature of CR, and can also\nbe triggered by other resonances (e.g., 4:1).\n3 Those for which the CR radius is larger than 1.4 times the\nbar's semimajor axis, (e.g., Aguerri et al. 2003).\n\n2\n\n\fwith a different pattern speed. They also consider\n\"super-fast\" bars, for which the bar's CR is well\ninside the bar's end and spirals are decoupled, although so far no theoretical models (e.g., n-body\nor response) have produced a consistent system\nwith CR within the bar.\nObservations also indicate that around 20% of\nearly spiral galaxies are double-bar or nested bar\nsystems (Laine et al. 2002; Erwin 2004, 2009). In\nthese systems, an outer or primary bar harbors an\ninner or secondary bar in the nucleus. The inner\nbar rotation is independent from that of the outer\nbar. There have also been suggestions of triple-bar\nsystems (e.g. NGC 2681, Erwin & Sparke 1999).\n1.1.\n\nstar formation activity in the bar and central regions (see also Garc\u0131\u0301a-Barreto et al. 1996).\nAccording to Athanassoula (1992), gas density\nenhancements perpendicular and at the end of the\nbar are often seen in simulations. She also notices that, for bars with \"straight\" dust lanes, star\nformation is difficult along the bar because of considerable shear (the situation may be different for\ncurved lanes/shocks). These \"straight\" dust lanes\noccur in strongly barred galaxies (Comer\u00f3n et al.\n2009). Regardless of this, Sheth et al. (2000) argue that some stars may be formed between the\nbar's end and the circumnuclear region. In their\nmodel, stars are born in \"dust spurs\" on the trailing side of the bar that feed the main dust lanes.\nZurita & P\u00e9rez (2008), based on H\u03b1 , optical, and\nNIR observations, find evidence to support this\nmodel in the barred spiral NGC 1530. They suggest that stars are formed in the dust spurs and\nmigrate across the bar to its leading side (see also\nAsif et al. 2005; Elmegreen et al. 2009).\nThe existence of phase shifts between the H\u03b1\nemission, the old stellar component of the bar,\nand the CO emission along it has been noticed\nby Martin & Friedli (1997), Verley et al. (2007),\nand Sheth et al. (2002). The H\u03b1 leads both the\nCO and old stars, although no systematic pattern\nwith galactocentric radius is measured. These observations support the idea that star formation can\nbe triggered in the bar region.\nIf spiral arms in barred galaxies trigger star\nformation, then azimuthal color gradients must\nbe observed across them (e.g. Roberts 1969;\nGonz\u00e1lez & Graham 1996; Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Garc\u0131\u0301a et al.\n2009a,b), due to the aging of stars and their velocities relative to the spiral arms. In the cases where\nspirals corotate with the bar, inverse color gradients (i.e., the direction of stellar aging is contrary\nto the sense of rotation) are expected.\nAge gradients across bars have also been predicted by recent numerical simulations (Dobbs & Pringle\n2010). Moreover, Mazzuca et al. (2008) have detected azimuthal age gradients in \u223c half of a sample of 22 nuclear rings, that they speculate may\nbe related to enhanced star formation in the contact points of bar and ring. In the bar region,\nthe mechanisms triggering star formation may be\ndifferent from the one that sets off star formation\nin spiral arms, due to the diverse dynamics and\nshock conditions.\n\nStar formation\n\nIt is commonly observed that giant HII region\ncomplexes occur at the end of the bar, where the\nspiral arms seem to originate (Roberts et al. 1979;\nKenney & Lord 1991). However, not all barred\nspirals show this feature clearly, and they present\nH\u03b1 emission in other regions as well, e.g., along\nthe bar (see Garc\u0131\u0301a-Barreto et al. 1996). Phillips\n(1993, 1996) proposes that barred galaxies can be\nclassified according to their star formation properties. Galaxies with Hubble type SBb and \"flat\"4\nbars have scant star formation in the bar region\nand a concentration of HII regions in inner rings.5\nStar formation activity can be very high in the circumnuclear region. The second group corresponds\nto Hubble type SBc and \"exponential\" bar type.\nThis group has luminous HII regions in the bars,\npoorly defined rings, and less star formation in the\ncircumnuclear region. In both SBb and SBc galaxies, the star formation rates per unit area seem to\nbe enhanced in the region where the bar joins the\nspiral arms, more noticeably in the SBb group.\nPhillips (1996) points out that SBa galaxies tend\nto show star formation in ring structures, but no\n4 The\n\nlight profile of flat bars decreases with radius more\nslowly than the spiral arm profile. Conversely, the radial\nscale length of exponential bars is the same or shorter than\nthat of the spiral arms (Elmegreen & Elmegreen 1985)\n5 Inner rings are commonly found at the end of the bar (e.g.,\nAthanassoula et al. 2009a). Barred spirals may also show\nrings in the nucleus and near the outer Lindblad resonance (Sellwood & Wilkinson 1993). Rings are commonly associated both with resonances (Schwarz 1981,\n1984; Byrd et al. 1994), and with active and recent star\nformation (Buta & Combes 1996).\n\n3\n\n\fHere, we aim to investigate azimuthal color\n(age) gradients across bars and spirals in SB (or\nstrong SAB) galaxies, and the connection between\nthese color gradients and bar/spiral dynamics. In\nfigure 1, we show expected sites of color gradients;\nin this example, the bar ends near corotation (CR)\nand spiral arms corotate with the bar, which is not\nnecessarily always the case.\n2.\n\nobservations were made with the IRIM camera,\nthat employed a 2562 NICMOS3 array, with a 2\u2032\u2032\npixel\u22121 plate scale.\n2.1.\n\nData reduction\n\nThe data were properly reduced with the image\nprocessing package IRAF6 (Tody 1986, 1993) and\nfortran 77 routines. In the optical we applied overscan and trimming corrections. We produced a\ncombined bias frame with the \"minmax\" rejection\nalgorithm and subtracted it from the data. Dark\ncurrent frames were inspected, but their counts\nwere found to be negligible. Twilight flats were\ncompared with dome flats, and the former were\nfound to be better. A \"master\" flat field image\nwas obtained for each filter by scaling flat fields\nby their median, averaging them with a sigma\nclipping algorithm, and dividing the result by its\nmean. Objects were then divided by the appropriate \"master\" flat. Bad pixels masks were created\nwith the assistance of both dome and twilight flat\nimages. Sky subtraction was achieved by masking\nbright objects and obtaining the median of the remaining pixels. For some objects the sky emission\nwas not uniform and we fitted a plane, instead of a\nconstant median value. To produce mosaics, individual images were superpixelated by a factor of 2\nin each dimension. Each superpixelated frame was\ninspected for artifacts (e.g., asteroid traces) and\nthe respective pixels were masked. The images\nwere then registered to the nearest pixel (i.e., half\nan original pixel), and a median mosaic was obtained. Cosmic rays were located and masked by\ncomparing the median mosaic with each individual\nframe. A final mosaic was then obtained by adding\nthe superpixelated, registered, clean frames.\nFor the NIR data, we first corrected for the nonlinearity of the detector. A polynomial function\nwas adjusted to each pixel of dome flats of increasing exposure times. Source variability and readout delay time images were used when available,\nor obtained via iterations. The flat-field correction\nwas done analogously to the optical case. Sky and\nobject frames were taken in an alternating fashion,\nand with no more than a few minutes difference;\n\nObservations\n\nOur sample consists of 11 barred spirals, 9 of\nthem classified as SB, and two as SAB in the Third\nReference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies (RC3,\nde Vaucouleurs et al. 1991). Statistics show that\n\u223c30% of spirals are strongly barred in the optical (de Vaucouleurs 1963; Sellwood & Wilkinson\n1993). In the NIR, Eskridge et al. (2000) find that\n\u223c56% are strongly barred (SB) and \u223c16%, weakly\nbarred (SAB). Their study also shows that late\ntype spirals (Sc-Sm) hold the same fraction of bars\nas early types (Sa-Sb).\nOptical and NIR data were acquired during\n1992-1995 with four different telescopes in three\nobservatories: the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory (CTIO) 0.9-m and 1.5-m, the Lick Observatory 1-m, and the Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) 1.3-m telescopes. Deep photometric images were taken in the optical filters g,\nr, and i, and in the NIR J, Ks or K \u2032 . Effective\nwavelengths and widths of all the filters are listed\nin table 1; the observation log for the 11 galaxies\nis shown in table 2.\nThe CTIO 0.9-m optical telescope used a Tek\n10242 and a Tek 20482 CCDs, both with a 0.\u2032\u2032 4\npixel\u22121 plate scale. The CTIO infrared observations were performed at the 1.5-m telescope,\nwith the Ohio State Infrared Imager/Spectrometer\n(OSIRIS) in February 1994, and with the CIRIM\ninstrument in September 1994 and September\n1995. Both CIRIM and OSIRIS used 2562 NICMOS3 arrays; the CIRIM focus was adjusted to\ngive a 1.\u2032\u2032 16 pixel\u22121 plate scale, whereas OSIRIS\nwas used in the f 3 image mode, that provided a\nplate scale of 1.\u2032\u2032 1 pixel\u22121 . The CCD at the Lick\n1-m telescope was a Ford 20482, with a plate scale\nof 0.\u2032\u2032 185 pixel\u22121 . For the infrared observations at\nLick, the same telescope was fitted with the LIRC2 camera; it had a 2562 NICMOS II detector, with\na 1.\u2032\u2032 145 pixel\u22121 plate scale. The KPNO infrared\n\n6\n\n4\n\nIRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy\nObservatories, which are operated by the Association of\nUniversities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.\n\n\fFig. 1.- Schematic of stellar age gradients in a barred galaxy. Gradients are shown by arrows that go from\nblue (young stars) to red (old stars), across a strong bar with straight dust lanes, and through the spiral\narms; they are produced by stars born in a shock that then drift away as they age. In this example, the bar\nends near CR and the arms corotate with the bar; because the observed arms are completely beyond the CR\nradius, the spiral pattern overtakes the gas in the disk and the gradients in the arms are \"inverse\", that is,\nthe stellar aging vector is opposite to the direction of disk rotation.\n\n5\n\n\fsky exposures were centered at different positions\nwith respect to the objects, and separated from\nthem by \u223c 10\u2032 , or about twice the linear size of\nthe field-of-view. Bright objects in the sky frames\nwere masked, and the four sky exposures closest\nin time to each object were median scaled, averaged with a rejection of deviant pixels, scaled to\nthe mean sky value of the object, and subtracted\nfrom it; this process also takes care of dark current removal. Flat field corrections were applied\nwith master flats derived from dome flats. Mosaic\nregistering and cosmic ray masking were achieved\nwith the same procedure used for the optical data.\n2.2.\n\nCalibration\n\nThe optical calibration was done in the ThuanGunn system (Thuan & Gunn 1976; Wade et al.\n1979).\nThe zero point of this photometric\nsystem is chosen such that the standard star\nBD+17\u25e6 4708 has g = r = i = 9.5. Synthetic magnitudes were obtained for other spectrophotometric standards7 , using the spectral energy distributions in Oke & Gunn (1983), Stone\n(1977), Massey et al. (1988), Massey & Gronwall\n(1990), Hamuy et al. (1992), and Hamuy et al.\n(1994), and system response curves for each detector/filter/telescope/observatory combination (for\ndetails, see Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Garc\u0131\u0301a et al. 2009a). The\nbest photometric galaxy frame was selected for\neach object, and the final mosaic was scaled to\nit. The NIR J, H and Ks data were calibrated\nwith frames from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS, Skrutskie et al. 1997, 2006). The K\ndata were calibrated with the Carter & Meadows\n(1995) photometric standard stars, transformed to\nthe CTIO system (Carter 1990). For the K \u2032 data,\nwe adopt K \u2032 = K+0.2(H\u2212K) (Wainscoat & Cowie\n1992), and use the photometric standard stars\nof Hawarden et al. (2001). The optical data were\ndegraded to the resolution of the NIR data.\n\n7\n\nFeige 15, 25, 34, 56, 92, 98; Kopff 27; LTT 377, 7987, 9239;\nEG 21; BD+40\u25e6 4032; and Hiltner 600.\n\n6\n\n\fTable 1\nFilter characteristics\nFilter\n\n\u03bbef f\n\nFWHM\n\ng\nr\ni\nJ\nH\nKs\nK\u2032\nK\n\n5000\u00c5\n6800\u00c5\n7800\u00c5\n1.25\u03bcm\n1.65\u03bcm\n2.16\u03bcm\n2.11\u03bcm\n2.2\u03bcm\n\n830\u00c5\n1330\u00c5\n1420\u00c5\n0.29\u03bcm\n0.29\u03bcm\n0.33\u03bcm\n0.35\u03bcm\n0.41\u03bcm\n\n7\n\n\fTable 2\nObservation Log\nObject\nNGC 718 . . . . . .\n\nNGC 864 . . . . . .\n\nNGC 4314 . . . . . .\n\nNGC 266 . . . . . .\n\nNGC 986 . . . . . .\n\nNGC 7496 . . . . . .\n\nNGC 5383 . . . . . .\n\nNGC 4593 . . . . . .\n\nNGC 3059 . . . . . .\n\nNGC 7479 . . . . . .\n\nNGC 3513 . . . . . .\n\nFilter\ng\nr\ni\nJ\nKs\ng\nr\ni\nJ\nKs\ng\nr\ni\nJ\nJ\nKs\ng\nr\ni\nJ\nK\u2032\ng\nr\ni\nJ\nKs\ng\nr\ni\nJ\nKs\ng\nr\ni\nJ\nJ\nKs\ng\nr\ni\nJ\nK\ng\nr\ni\nJ\nH\ng\nr\ni\nJ\nKs\ng\nr\ni\nJ\nH\nK\n\nExposure(s)\n8100.\n7200.\n4200.\n672.\n336.\n3865.\n4695.\n3600.\n1380.\n360.\n5400.\n7599.\n2100.\n1252.\n840.\n540.\n14646.\n10165.\n6600.\n300.\n352.\n3600.\n5100.\n3900.\n810.\n420.\n3600.\n3600.\n3600.\n300.\n330.\n2580.\n2707.\n780.\n626.\n840.\n560.\n3600.\n4500.\n4200.\n971.\n868.\n4800.\n4200.\n5400.\n313.\n313.\n10620.\n6960.\n8649.\n1080.\n396.\n4200.\n4500.\n4200.\n2719.\n2718.\n1042.\n\nTelescope\n\nDate (month/year)\n\nMean seeing\n\nLick 1 m\n\"\n\"\nKitt Peak 1.3 m\n\"\nLick 1 m\n\"\n\"\nKitt Peak 1.3 m\n\"\nLick 1 m\n\"\n\"\nLick 1 m\nKitt Peak 1.3 m\n\"\nLick 1 m\n\"\n\"\nKitt Peak 1.3 m\nLick 1 m\nCTIO 0.9 m\n\"\n\"\nCTIO 1.5 m\n\"\nCTIO 0.9 m\n\"\n\"\nCTIO 1.5 m\n\"\nLick 1 m\n\"\n\"\nLick 1 m\nKitt Peak 1.3 m\n\"\nCTIO 0.9 m\n\"\n\"\nCTIO 1.5 m\n\"\nCTIO 0.9 m\n\"\n\"\nCTIO 1.5 m\n\"\nLick 1 m\n\"\n\"\nKitt Peak 1.3 m\n\"\nCTIO 0.9 m\n\"\n\"\nCTIO 1.5 m\n\"\n\"\n\n10/92, 11/92, 9/93\n10/92, 9/93, 11/93\n10/92, 9/93\n11/94\n\"\n9/93\n9/93, 11/93\n11/93\n9/93, 11/94\n9/93\n3/93, 4/93, 4/94\n4/93, 2/94, 4/94\n2/94, 4/94\n2/95\n3/94\n\"\n11/92, 9/93, 11/93, 10/94, 11/94\n11/92, 9/93, 10/93, 11/93, 10/94, 11/94\n11/92, 9/93, 11/93, 10/94, 11/94\n9/93\n12/94\n9/94\n\"\n\"\n9/94, 9/95\n\"\n9/94\n\"\n\"\n9/95\n\"\n4/94, 11/94\n\"\n\"\n2/95\n3/94\n\"\n3/94, 3/95\n\"\n\"\n2/94\n\"\n3/94, 3/95\n\"\n\"\n2/94\n\"\n8/92, 9/93, 10/94\n\"\n\"\n9/93, 11/94\n\"\n3/94, 3/95\n\"\n\"\n2/94\n\"\n\"\n\n2.1\u2032\u2032\n\n8\n\n1.7\u2032\u2032\n\n1.9\u2032\u2032\n\n1.6\u2032\u2032\n\n1.5\u2032\u2032\n\n1.6\u2032\u2032\n\n1.4\u2032\u2032\n\n1.5\u2032\u2032\n\n1.6\u2032\u2032\n\n1.8\u2032\u2032\n\n1.5\u2032\u2032\n\n\f9\n\n\fthe Q(rJgi) \"unwrapped\" frame, with the aid of\na dust lane tracer (e.g., the g \u2212 J color).

Briefly, the\nprocedure involves \"unwrapping\" the spiral arms\nby plotting them in a \u03b8 vs. lnR map (e.g., Iye et al.\n1982; Elmegreen et al. 1992).

The error in the velocity is comparable to expected deviations from a flat rotation curve (e.g., see the\nmodel rotation curves in Romero-G\u00f3mez et al. 2007).

In the bottom left panel (c),\na zoomed-in version of the Q(rJgi) vs. d profile\n(solid line) is compared with a stellar population\nmodel (dotted line) that has been \"stretched\" in\ntage to fit the data. Model stellar age, tage , in units\nof 107 yr, is shown in the upper x-axis. The vertical error bars show the size of photometric random\nerrors, excluding the systematic calibration error;\nhorizontal error bars represent possible deformations of the Q(rJgi) profiles, due to density and\nmetallicity variations in the young and old populations (see Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Garc\u0131\u0301a et al. 2009a). We also\ncompare the data with a model that considers the\ndissolution of stellar groups (Wielen 1977) after 50\n\nprovides a good, homogeneous, standard for our\npurposes. We determined most bar lengths using\nthe maximum ellipticity criterion (see table 4). To\nthis end, we masked bright stars and nearby objects, and fitted ellipses to the bar's isophotes (in\nthe NIR, mostly in the 2 \u03bcm, deprojected frames)\nwith the IRAF task ELLIPSE (Jedrzejewski 1987;\nBusko 1996). We then generated plots of isophotal\nellipticity13 and PA versus radius (Wozniak et al.\n1995; Mulchaey et al. 1997; Gadotti & de Souza\n2006). The brightest pixel near the nuclear region was given as an initial guess for the isophote\ncenter, while re-centering was allowed for outer\nisophotes. A second \"mean isophote center\" was\ncomputed with these re-centered isophotes; this\nsecond center was then used, without allowing for\nfurther re-centering. We also performed a visual\nestimate of the bar's extension. In figure 2, we\ncompare the results of both measurements.\nFinally, we compare the bar length with the bar\nCR radius; the latter is calculated based on the\npattern speeds derived from the color gradients in\nbar regions.\n4.\n\nResults\n\nIn figures 3-44, ordered by galaxy Hubble type,\nwe show results for 42 regions with color gradient candidates. Of these, 22 are located along the\nbar, and 20 are found in the spiral arms. For all\nobjects, the direction of disk rotation was established assuming that spiral arms trail. Dust lane\nlocations were inferred from the (g \u2212 J) color, and\nbar or spiral perturbations were traced in the NIR.\nWe fit the data with the stellar population synthesis models of S. Charlot & G. Bruzual (2007,\nprivate communication); only models with solar\nmetallicity are considered. The duration of the\nstar formation burst is taken to be 2 \u00d7 107 yr; a\nfraction of young stars of 2% by mass is mixed with\na background of old stars 5 \u00d7 109 yr old. We use a\nSalpeter initial mass function (IMF) with a lower\nmass limit Mlower = 0.1M\u2299 , and we try two different IMF upper mass limits Mupper: 10 and 100\nM\u2299 (see figure 45). It is important to have in mind\nthat real data may have Mupper somewhere in between these values. Models with Mupper = 100M\u2299\nexhibit a sharp peak shortly after tage = 0 yr\n13\n\n\u0010\nEllipticity = 1 \u2212\n\nminor axis\nmajor axis\n\n14 This\n\nis the aging direction expected from observations\n(Zurita & P\u00e9rez\n2008)\nand\nsimulations (Dobbs & Pringle 2010).\n\n\u0011\n\n12\n\n\fFig. 2.- Comparison between the bar extent obtained with the bar's isophotes (Rbar , see text), and the\nestimate by sight (Rvisual ). The dashed and dotted lines indicate, respectively, the mean and the error of\nthe ratio of both measurements, 1.02\u00b10.04. The object numbers in the \"New General Catalogue\" (NGC,\nDreyer 1888), ordered by Hubble type, are shown in the horizontal axis.\n\n13\n\n\fNGC 4314 (Figures 10 - 11). Two color gradient candidates were found in the bar of this object.\nThe one in region A is located in the leading side\nof the bar; the CR radius inferred from the comparison between theoretical and observed Q(rJgi)\nprofiles is near the location of maximum ellipticity. The color gradient candidate in region B is\nlocated in the trailing side of the bar; the inferred\nCR agrees, within the errors, with the result from\nregion A. No color gradients were found in the\narms.\nNGC 266 (Figures 12 - 15). Unfortunately,\nthe error due to the inclination angle, \u03b1, is\nhigher than the \u03b1 value itself (see table 3). Although this produces very large errors in the computed \u03a9p values, the errors in the resonance positions are reasonable, when equations A1 and A3\nfrom Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Garc\u0131\u0301a et al. (2009a) are used. Region A is the only one detected in the bar of this\nobject, and its analysis yields a CR position close\nto the maximum of isophotal ellipticity; this region\nwas fitted with a model with Mupper = 100M\u2299.\nRegions B (presumably just before corotation,\nMupper = 10M\u2299 ) and D (presumably just after\ncorotation, Mupper = 100M\u2299) give similar resonance positions that also agree with the results\nof region A, within the errors. The resonance position derived from region C is within 1 \u03c3 of the\nresult of region A, and within 2 \u03c3 of the position\nfound from regions B and D. Regions B and C appear to be associated with a \"ring\" feature, rather\nthan with the spiral arms.\nNGC 986 (Figures 16 - 19). This galaxy shows\nan important activity in the bar region when observed in the Q(rJgi) index. The bar's end is\nmade evident more by the change in PA of the\nisophotes, than by the location of their maximum\nellipticity. Region A harbors a color gradient candidate in the bar whose analysis results in a CR\nradii close to the place where the isophotes change\nPA. Region B is located near the end of the bar;\nthe fit of a stellar model (with Mupper = 100M\u2299)\nto its observed Q(rJgi) profile gives a CR position that does not coincide with the bar's end.\nFor regions C and D, in one of the arms, the corotation position coincides (within the errors) with\nthe bar's end.\nNGC 7496 (Figures 20 - 24). The northern spiral arm (lower arm in our deprojected image) displays a compact elongated region of high surface\n\nMyr (dashed line, see \u00a7 5.1.1).

Error bars were obtained from the ELLIPSE task in IRAF. Hatched regions highlight\nthe bar corotation region, as derived from the\ncomparison between photometric data and stellar\nmodels.\nIn table 4, we show the pattern speeds and resonance radii inferred from the comparison of stellar\npopulation synthesis models with observed color\ngradients.\nRemarks for each object:\nNGC 718 (Figures 3 - 5). Regions A and B\nbelong to the bar region. For both regions, the\norigin (tage = 0) of the stellar model that bests\nfits the observations is located in the leading side\nof the bar; the two regions yield a similar bar CR\nradius, within the errors. An inverse gradient is\nobserved in spiral region NGC 718 C; this region\nwas fit with Mupper = 100M\u2299. The arm and bar\npattern speeds are similar in this object.\nNGC 864 (Figures 6 - 9). Although the positions of color gradient candidates A and B, in\nthe bar region, are quite different, relative to the\nbar Ks surface brightness and dust (g \u2212 J) profiles, their analysis provides a similar CR position,\nwithin the errors. This barred galaxy has spiral\narms with a \"ragged\" structure. Region C, located in the beginning of the eastern arm (left arm\nin the deprojected image), gives a corotation position near the end of the spiral arms, at \u223c 76.5\u00b10.5\narcsec. Region D, situated in an arm structure apparently decoupled from the main pattern, gives\na corotation position similar to that of region C,\nwithin the errors. The two main arms of this object have different Q mean values, possibly owing\nto different levels of star formation activity16\n15\n\nAlthough for some of the regions this time interval may include structures not related to the color gradient (see, e.g.,\nregions NGC 266 A & D, and NGC 3513 D; figures 12, 15,\nand 42, respectively).\n16\nThis\nbehavior\nwas\ndubbed\n\"Q\neffect\"\nin Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Garc\u0131\u0301a et al. (2009a).\n\n14\n\n\fbrightness, even in Ks ; this arm is also more extended in radius, when compared to the southern\narm (upper arm in our deprojected image). Regions A and B are located in the bar and give similar CR radii, that encompass the location of maximum ellipticity of the bar. Region C is probably\nlocated near the bar's CR, a fact that makes the\ndetermination of dynamic parameters uncertain.\nThe observations, and the fit of the stellar model\nto regions D and E indicate inverse color gradients.\nCorotation is close to the ellipticity maximum of\nthe bar; all the derived positions agree within 1 \u03c3,\nexcept for the determination from region D.\nNGC 5383 (Figures 26 - 26). This barred\ngalaxy has very short spiral arms that do not reach\nthe outer disk. The analysis of color gradient candidates in regions A and B results in similar CR\npositions before the end of the bar. This may be\ndue to strong non-circular motions that lead to an\noverestimate of \u03a9p , and hence to an underestimation of the CR radius.\nNGC 4593 (Figures 27 - 31). Regions A\n(Mupper = 100M\u2299) and B (Mupper = 10M\u2299 ),\nin the bar region, give a similar CR position near\nthe maximum of ellipticity. Region C is located\nnear the bar's end, and is probably associated\nwith a \"ring\" feature. Region D, inverse color\ngradient in the spiral arm region, gives a similar\ncorotation position in accordance with regions A\nand B. Region E (\"direct\" color gradient) yields a\ncorotation position further away from the galaxy\ncenter than the one inferred from region D. The\neastern and western sides of the bar (respectively,\nupper and lower sides in the deprojected frame)\nhave different Q(rJgi) mean values.\nNGC 3059 (Figures 32 - 33). This object is\nlikely a double-bar system, and it is difficult to\nassess the bar's end from the ellipticity and PA\nvs. radius plots. However, the CR position derived\nfrom the bar region A lies close to the bar endpoint\ndetermined from visual inspection (\u223c 19.2 \u00b1 1.4\narcsec). Region B in the arms, gives a corotation\nposition at radii larger than the bar's end.\nNGC 7479 (Figures 34 - 38).\nAccording\nto Wozniak et al. (1995), the HII regions located along the bar, near the dust lanes, show a\n\"stretched\" appearance probably due to strong gas\nflows that may trigger star formation. Regions A,\nB, (Mupper = 10M\u2299), and C (Mupper = 100M\u2299)\nshow candidate color gradients in the bar. The\n\ncomparison of stellar models with observations\nrenders CR positions close to the ellipticity maximum (i.e., close to the bar's end). Region D,\nsituated in one of the spiral arms and after the\nbar's corotation, features an inverse color gradient. The computed resonance positions agree,\nwithin the errors, for regions A through D. Region\nE lies near the bar's end; even though no color gradients are expected at this position,17 the Q(rJgi)\nprofile indicates that some star formation is taking\nplace.\nNGC 3513 (Figures 39 - 44). Regions B, C, E,\nand F exhibit several adjacent Q(rJgi) profiles, so\nit is hard to define a unique color gradient candidate. Regions A and B belong to the bar, and their\nanalysis locates CR just inside its end. Region C\nis located very close to the bar's end. Region D, in\nthe spiral arm region, is presumably located inside\ncorotation; the best fit of the models to the observed Q(rJgi) profiles suggests Mupper = 100M\u2299\nfor this region, and yields a corotation radius close\nto the change in ellipticity and PA. In contradiction with the region D result, regions E and F indicate that the bar and spiral perturbations may\nrotate with different pattern speeds. Once again,\nQ(rJgi) has different mean values in both arms.\n\n17\n\n15\n\nAt corotation the pattern and the rotating material have\nthe same angular velocity, hence shocks should not occur\n(at least for non-barred spirals).\n\n\fTable 4\nObserved and derived dynamic parameters.\n\n16\n\nGalaxy and region\n\nFigure\n\nNGC718 A\nNGC718 B\nNGC718 C\nNGC864 A\nNGC864 B\nNGC864 C\nNGC864

This\nis the case, even for regions where double peaks\nor dust lanes are seen (e.g., region NGC 864 B,\nfigure 7). For most of the fits we do not have\ntage = 0 for d = 0 precisely (e.g., region NGC\n7496 A in figure 20). This is due to the fact that\nonly the width of the model profile in Q(rJgi) is\nfitted to the observations by stretching. Theoretically, for spiral regions tage = 0 should coincide\nor be located after d = 0. In real galaxies, it is\nhard to pinpoint where the onset of star formation really occurs. One important reason is the\nfact that a diffuse cloud of neutral gas has first to\nbecome a dense cloud, then a molecular cloud, and\nfinally a self-gravitating cloud to achieve star formation; this process may take \u223c 107 years (see,\ne.g., Tamburro et al. 2008; Egusa et al. 2009).\n\nDiscussion\nCharacteristics of observed color gradients\n\nIn a \"standard color gradient picture\", assuming circular motions, one would expect an azimuthal sequence starting with compression of gas,\ndust lanes, star formation onset and stellar drift,\nwhich would lead to color gradients. When one\nadds an extended period of star formation, dispersion velocities and post shock velocities, the predicted color profiles may become rather broad (see,\ne.g., Yuan & Grosbol 1981).\nAlthough shocks and/or dust lanes are located\nmainly upstream relative to the spiral potential minimum, in a more detailed scenario, for\ncertain models and relatively short radial intervals, they can be found downstream (in the\ngas stream direction) the spiral potential minimum (Gittins & Clarke 2004). This is due to the\nfact that pitch angles of the arms are expected\nto follow iP > iD > iSF , where iP is the pitch\nangle of the potential, iD is the pitch angle of the\ndust lane (the shock), and iSF is the pitch angle of\nstar formation. According to this, the azimuthal\nrelative location of potential and dust lanes may\nchange within the same galaxy and be radially\ndependent. In principle, the local potential minimum could be determined from the the K-band\nspiral arm.18 Nevertheless, gravity is a long-range\nforce, and all the non-axisymmetric contributions\nmust be taken into account for local potential minimum determinations. Thus, the local potential\ndoes not necessarily coincide with the local density of old stars (see, e.g., Zhang 1996; Berman\n2003; Gittins & Clarke 2004; Zhang & Buta 2007;\nButa & Zhang 2009), and the expected locations\nof the dust lanes must follow the potential, rather\nthan the K-band intensity.\nFor some of the bar regions presented in figures 3-44, the tage = 0 location of the gradient\nseems to be located before the main dust lane\npeak. This can be attributed to the fact that star\nformation in bars is supposed to begin at the dust\n\n5.1.1.\n\nDownstream decline of the gradients\n\nMart\u0131\u0301nez-Garc\u0131\u0301a et al. (2009a) already noticed\nthat for some spiral regions there is a \"downstream\ndecline\" (or \"downstream fall\") of the gradients.\nIn such regions, the observed Q(rJgi) profile declines below the model (or the value Q(rJgi) \u223c\n1.57, for solar metallicity, in figure 45), apparently returning to the \"old background population\" level, or lower, by t \u2248 5 \u00d7 107 years, much\nfaster than the theoretical expectations. This is\nthe case, for example, of regions NGC 864 C, NGC\n7496 B & C, NGC 7479 B, NGC 3513 A & C\n(figures 8, 21, 22, 35, 39, and 41, respectively),\nfor which the fit between Q(rJgi) data and dotted line model is not good, except for the range\n0 . tage . 50 Myr.19\nMart\u0131\u0301nez-Garc\u0131\u0301a et al. (2009a) hypothesized\nthat the decline of the observed Q(rJgi) profiles\nbelow the models (that assume pure circular orbits) might be caused by stellar non-circular motions in the data. However, Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Garc\u0131\u0301a et al.\n(2009b) found that non-circular motions cannot\n\n18 As\n\nalready mentioned in \u00a7 3, although young stellar populations may account for only 3% of the global K-band flux\n(Rhoads 1998), they may contribute up to a third of the 2\n\u03bcm emission in local features.\n\n19 Incidentally,\n\nBruzual & Charlot models previously to 1997\nagreed much better with this rapid decline of Q; see GG96,\ntheir figure 19.\n\n18\n\n\f\"toy model\" for Q(rJgi), consisting of two phases.\nDuring the first phase, while tage < 50 Myr, the\nfractions by mass of young, \u03b2I = 2%, and old,\n\u03b2II = 98%, stars are kept constant. During the\nsecond phase, we assume (1) that the fraction of\nyoung stars changes as \u03b2I \u221d 1/t3age , and (2) that\nthe surface density of young stars behaves in the\nsame way (see eq. 10 in Wielen 1977).\nThe models produced with this approximation\nare displayed in figure 47, with a continuous line\nfor models with the IMF Mupper = 10M\u2299 , and\na dotted line for those with Mupper = 100M\u2299\n(see also figures 8 and 9 in Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Garc\u0131\u0301a et al.\n2009a). According to figure 47, the dissolution\nof stellar groups, as a consequence of disk heating, may provide an efficient mechanism to explain the observed \"downstream decline\" of the\ngradients encountered in Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Garc\u0131\u0301a et al.\n(2009a), and in this investigation. It is important\nto mention that the dissolution effect operates also\nin the presence of non-circular motions.\n\nexplain the discrepancy.\nA solution to this problem may be provided by\nthe dissolution of stellar groups scenario proposed\nby Wielen (1977, see figure 46). According to this\nauthor, the diffusion of stellar orbits can enhance\nthe dissolution of young stellar groups by increasing their internal velocity dispersion. To explain\nthe observed increase in the velocity dispersion of\nstars with age, Wielen (1977) proposes the existence of local fluctuations of the gravitational field\nwith a rather stochastic behavior. This irregular\nfield has the effect of creating a diffusion process\nin the velocity space of stars. The dissolution of\nstellar groups proceeds in two phases. During the\nfirst phase, the internal velocity dispersion, \u03c3int ,\ncauses the group to expand, until its diameter,\nDsg (tage ) is larger than the distance over which simultaneous perturbations (for stars close together\nin space) are significantly correlated, i.e., the coherence length, Lco .20 During this first phase, the\ncenter of mass of the group is affected by diffusion\nmechanisms, while the members of the group only\nsuffer small tidal effects, thus \u03c3int \u223c constant. The\nduration of the first phase is given by:\ntphase1 = 0.975(Lco \u2212 Dsg (0))/\u03c3int ,\n\nOther dissolution scenarios:\nAnother effective disruption mechanism for star\nclusters comes from stellar winds and supernovae\nexplosions that remove gas (and dust) on short\ntimescales. These perturb the potential and cause\nyoung star clusters to become unbound (see, e.g.,\nBastian & Goodwin 2006; Gieles & Bastian 2008;\nLamers et al. 2005). This \"infant mortality\" occurs during the first 10 Myr and affects the most\nluminous clusters (those with the most rapid color\nevolution). Nevertheless, stars escape with the initial velocity dispersion of the cluster and are physically associated with it for 10-40 Myr after gas removal (Bastian & Goodwin 2006). The color gradients presented in this investigation are probably\nformed by clusters that survive \"infant mortality\"\nat least for 50 Myr.\n\n(6)\n\nfor tphase1 in Myr, Lco \u2212 Dsg (0) in pc, and \u03c3int in\nkm s\u22121 . For typical values of \u03c3int =10 km s\u22121 ,\nand Lco \u2212 Dsg (0)=500 pc (Wielen 1977), we have\nthat:\ntphase1 \u223c 50Myr.\nDuring the second phase of the dissolution (after tphase1 years), the perturbations over each star\nmember of the group are not longer correlated,\nand the group dissolves with time because of the\ndiffusion mechanism. During this phase the velocity dispersion increases with time, i.e., \u03c3 = \u03c3(t),\nwhere t = tage \u2212 tphase1 .\nIn order to evaluate the relevance of the dissolution of stellar groups scenario (Wielen 1977)\nfor the color gradient picture, we have built a\n\n5.1.2.\n\nColor gradients in dusty environments\n\nOne more issue in the \"standard color gradient picture\" relates to the Q(rJgi) value expected\nfor the old background population at tage < 0.\nAlso, Q(rJgi) (or any color) should return to the\nbackground value on both sides of the bar, at\nthe same spatial offsets. In some of the observed\n\n20 This\n\nlength depends on the mechanism that causes\nthe irregular gravitational field, with the consequent\ndisk heating.\nPossible mechanisms may be provided\nby giant molecular clouds, spiral arms (Lacey 1984,\n1991), small-scale dark matter clumps (Berezinsky et al.\n2003; Barranco & Bernal 2011), or massive dark clusters (Sanchez-Salcedo 1999) in dark matter halos.\n\n19\n\n\fcolor gradient candidates in this investigation, the\nQ(rJgi) index does not agree well with the models for tage < 0 (see, e.g., regions NGC 718 C,\nNGC 986 A, NGC 7479 A; figures 5, 16, and 34,\nrespectively).\nModels with pure old background population\nhave an approximately constant Q(rJgi) value,21\nregardless of surface brightness. However, the exact value depends on the average age and metallicity of the local region (see Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Garc\u0131\u0301a et al.\n2009a), that cannot, especially metallicity, be determined unambiguously just from photometric\ndata. A complementary possible explanation of\nwhy, for some regions, the Q(rJgi) index does not\ndecline to the background value for tage < 0 is\nthat the adopted method (see \u00a7 3.1) involves averaging over radial annuli to increase the S/N ratio.\nAlbeit we do so carefully, we may be combining\nzones with somewhat different background levels.\nYet another recurring concern is whether dust\ncan mimic the Q profile of a star formation burst,\nsince Q(rJgi) is reddening-insensitive for a foreground screen, but not exactly so for a mixture of dust and stars (Gonz\u00e1lez & Graham 1996;\nMart\u0131\u0301nez-Garc\u0131\u0301a et al. 2009a). The main expected\neffect would be a higher Q(rJgi) value (see figure 48).\nAssuming \u03c4V \u223c 1.0 (e.g., Xilouris et al. 1999)\nfor a nearly face-on disk, given the inclination angles of the galaxy sample, our observations cover\non average the range 0 < \u03c4V < 2.0. For regions\nwhere tage < 0, though, thick dust lanes may be\npresent with \u03c4V \u226b 2.0.\nFrom the Charlot & Fall (2000, see also Bruzual\n& Charlot 2003) dust model, we get the linear relation Q(rJgi) = 0.02\u03c4V + 1.51 (where 1.51 is\nthe background Q(rJgi) value; see figure 48 for\ntage \u223c 0).22 Thus, to get a Q(rJgi) profile reminiscent of a density wave induced color gradient\nin the absence of young stars, with a peak value\n\u223c 1.66, the dust must have \u03c4V \u223c 7.0. But also, for\nthis scenario to take place, \u03c4V must increase for\n\nQ(rJgi) to increase, and viceversa, i.e., the profile\nin a reddening sensitive index, like (g \u2212 J), must\nfollow the Q(rJgi) azimuthal distribution.\nFor tage > 0, dust becomes progressively less\nimportant, because star formation processes (e.g.,\nUV radiation) sweep away and destroy available\nmaterial. Indeed, concentrations of dust that are\nhigher downstream the shock than at the shock are\nnot observed in most real spiral arms. Fittingly,\nall of the observed color gradients indicate an inverse correlation between Q(rJgi) and (g \u2212 J), so\nthat dust cannot be mimicking a star formation\nburst.23 Although the situation may be different\nfor bar regions, we do not observe a correlation between the dust and Q(rJgi) profiles in any of the\nbar gradient candidates analyzed in this investigation.\nFinally, because of the connection between the\ngradients (i.e., star formation) and disk dynamics\n(i.e., the orbital resonance positions; see \u00a7 5.2),\nwe argue that dust features are not affecting the\nanalyzed gradients in any important way.\n5.2.\n\nConnection with dynamics\n\nIn figure 49, the pattern speed obtained from\neach region in NGC 7479 is plotted vs. the mean\nradius of the region. Notice the tendency to derive slower \u03a9bar\nfrom bar regions (A, B, C) at\np\nlarger radius. Likewise, figure 50 shows the \u03a9bar\np\nobtained for NGC 3513, vs. the radius of each region. As in plot 49 (NGC 7479), a trend whereby\n\u03a9bar\n\u221d r\u22121 is observed for the bar regions (A,\np\nB, and C). In Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Garc\u0131\u0301a et al. (2009b), we\nfound that this effect is observed in non-barred\nor weakly barred galaxies, if non-circular motions\nare present but color gradient data are analyzed\nassuming stars have purely circular orbits. In the\ncase of barred galaxies, non-circular motions in the\nbar cause \u03a9bar\nto be overestimated inside the bar\np\nCR radius; once more, the size of the discrepancy\nbetween the real and the measured pattern speed\nincreases as the radius decreases.24 This signature\n\n21\n\nQ(rJgi) only stabilizes after a couple of Gyr. Although we\nare using a background population 5 Gyr old, in actuality\nstars take at most a few hundred Myr to go from one arm\nto the next, so that the background will have a contribution\nfrom several previous bursts between 1e8 and 1e9 yr old,\nfor which Q is higher and still slowly declining.\n22 The mean photometric error in Q (excluding the zero point\nerror) is 4\u03c3Q(rJ gi) < 0.06 mag.\n\n23\n\nIn this regard, Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (1996) found that the gradient in M99 also follows the models when mapped in colors\nsensitive to dust, such as (g \u2212 i), (g \u2212 K), and (g \u2212 J). This\nwould not be the case if the profiles were contaminated by\ndust.\n24 Again, to explain a \"thinner\" gradient the observer has to\n\n20\n\n\fRCR\n\u223c 1.2, the expected rawhere we adopt R\nbar\ntio for spirals with well defined bars (see, e.g.,\nAthanassoula 1992; Elmegreen 1996; Buta & Zhang\n2009). In figure 52, we show \u03b4\u03a9p vs. Rmean /1.2Rbar;\nthis ratio is \u223c 1 for regions near CR. Once again,\nbar regions are shown with open red triangles to\ndistinguish them from spiral regions (solid black\ncircles). For the bar regions, there is a systematic trend, whereby \u03a9bar\nis overestimated at small\np\nradii, the magnitude of the bias is inversely correlated with radius, and the points converge to\n\u03b4\u03a9p = 0 as they approach the corotation zone.\nThis is the expected effect when non-circular motions are present, but color gradients are interpreted with a dynamic model that considers purely\ncircular motions (Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Garc\u0131\u0301a et al. 2009b).\nHowever, as a consequence of data processing that\nwas already discerned by these authors, regions in\nthe outer half of the bar yield \u03a9bar\nvalues with\np\nless than 50% error. The detectable trend, on the\nother hand, confirms the link of the gradients to\ndisk dynamics.\nIn figure 53, we plot \u03b4\u03a9p for the spiral arm regions vs. region radius, in the same units as figure 52; we highlight those with \"inverse\" color\ngradients (i.e., the sense of rotation is opposite\nto the observed aging of stars) with open red triangles. Most of these regions lie over the dotted\nline, where the pattern speed obtained from the\ncolor gradient candidates, \u03a9data , equals the pattern speed derived from a flat rotation curve, if\nthe bar CR is located at 1.2 Rbar . Conversely,\nregions where stars age in the direction of disk\nrotation (solid black circles) sit below the dotted\nline. If such \"inverse\" color gradients occur in objects where \u03a9bar\n\u2248 \u03a9spiral\n, then this plot may inp\np\ndicate the presence of non-circular motions close\nto corotation, that cause the overestimation of the\npattern speed with our method.\nOn the other hand, the existence of gradients\nwhere stellar aging follows disk rotation, at radii\nbeyond the bar CR radius, may be interpreted as\n\u03a9bar\n6= \u03a9spiral\n, i.e., decoupled pattern speeds for\np\np\nthe bar and the spiral; the CR radius of the spiral\npattern would be larger than that of the bar.26\n\ndoes not mean that \u03a9bar\nis changing with radius,\np\nin either kind of galaxy.25\nGiven that many of the computed resonance\npositions seem to be in accordance with theoretical predictions (e.g., bars ending near their CR\nradius), most of the analyzed color gradient candidates may indeed have a relation with the dynamics of the disk. Figure 51 shows a plot of\nbar extent, Rbar (see \u00a7 3.2), vs. bar CR radius,\nRCR , as inferred from the comparison between\nstellar population models, and broad-band optical and NIR observations. Red open triangles denote bar regions, whereas black solid circles indicate color gradient candidates in the arms. The\nplot is divided in three zones, i.e., the \"slow\",\n\"fast\", and \"forbidden\" bar areas; the latter corresponds to the \"super-fast\" bars of Buta & Zhang\n(2009). The dotted line, RCR = Rbar , and the\ndashed line, RCR = 1.4Rbar , enclose the parameter space where most of the points should be\nif bars end near CR (Aguerri et al. 2003). If\nthe spiral pattern speed, \u03a9spiral\n, is similar to\np\nbar\nthe bar's pattern speed, \u03a9p , then spiral region points should fall in this area, too. Unfortunately, with the GG96 method it is difficult\nto distinguish between \"super-fast\" bars and the\nexpected overestimation of \u03a9bar\np , owing to noncircular motions (Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Garc\u0131\u0301a et al. 2009b).\nAll the points below the RCR = Rbar (dotted) line\nare more likely due to the latter effect.

Through the\ncomparison of optical and NIR images with stellar\npopulation synthesis models, a link can be established between large-scale star formation in the\ndisks and bar/spiral dynamics.\nFor the bar regions, we compare the computed\nCR positions with the bar's end, and with results\nfrom other authors, both theoretical and observational.

During phase 1 (\u223c 50 Myr), the stellar\ngroup increases its diameter due to a \u223c constant internal velocity dispersion, until the \"coherence length\"\nis reached. During phase 2, the velocity dispersion increases with time and the \"diffusion of stellar orbits\"\ncauses the dissipation of the stellar group.\n\n71\n\n\fFig. 47.- Same as figure 45, including dissolution of stellar groups (Wielen 1977) after 50 Myr (see \u00a7 5.1.1).\n\n72\n\n\fFig. 48.- Index Q(rJgi) vs. time for CB07 models, reddened as per the two-component dust model\nof Charlot & Fall (2000).
