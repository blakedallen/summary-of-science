The beauty photoproduction cross\nsection is measured by ZEUS and H1 via the semileptonic decay. Both experiments\nuse the transverse lepton momentum with respect to a jet as an observable. The H1\ncentral silicon vertex detector makes it possible to analyse, in addition, the lepton\nimpact parameter spectrum, thus exploiting lifetime information for the first time\nat HERA. The combined lifetime and transverse momentum signature is further\nused to observe beauty production for the first time in deep inelastic scattering.\nAll results are compared with NLO QCD calculations.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe production of heavy quarks at HERA provides a valuable tool to probe\nproton structure and the mechanism of the hard subprocesses underlying ep\ninteractions. Within the framework of QCD, heavy quark production is predominantly gluon induced, which allows the gluon content of the proton to be\ninvestigated. The leading\u2013order (LO) process is boson gluon fusion, where a\nphoton emitted by the positron and a gluon coming from the proton form a\nquark-antiquark-pair. The exchange of a quasi\u2013real photon (photoproduction,\n\u03b3p) dominates over large photon virtualities (deep inelastic scattering, DIS).\nPerturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations, assuming the b quark to be dynamically produced in the hard subprocess (massive approach), are available in\nnext\u2013to\u2013leading order (NLO). In the case of beauty production, pQCD predictions are expected to be particularly reliable because the b quark mass sets\na hard scale. For this reason, b production is considered an excellent testing ground for pQCD even though the cross section is two and three orders of\nmagnitude below charm production and total cross sections, respectively. The\nfirst measurement of open b photoproduction at HERA1 yielded a cross section significantly above the QCD expectation. A similar discrepancy between\ndata and theoretical prediction has been observed in pp\u03042 and, recently, in \u03b3\u03b3 3\ninteractions. New data and improved experimental tools have now become\navailable to further study b production processes at HERA. Recent analyses,\nbased on semileptonic b hadron decays within jets, are presented here.\n\nDIS01-proceedings: submitted to World Scientific\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nZEUS\n\nZEUS has measured b photoproduction in inclusive muon4 and electron analyses. Here only the electron analysis is discussed, which has recently been\npublished5 . From data collected during 1996 and 1997, which correspond\nto an integrated luminosity of L = 38.5 pb\u22121 , a \u03b3p sample is obtained by\nrejecting events in which the scattered positron is found in the main detector. Jets are reconstructed, and events with at least two jets with transverse\nenergy Et (jet1(2) ) > 7(6) GeV are selected. Electrons are identified by combining calorimeter and drift chamber information. The hadronic background\nis statistically subtracted using the specific energy loss in the drift chamber.\nBackgrounds from Dalitz decays and photon conversions are removed explicitly, resulting in a sample of (943 \u00b1 69) electrons with a transverse momentum\npt > 1.6 GeV and pseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 1.1. For each electron, the transverse momentum prel\nrelative to the closest jet is reconstructed. Due to the\nt\nhigh b mass a harder prel\nspectrum is expected for the signal compared to\nt\nthe background. The measured differential cross section, d\u03c3/dprel\nt , is shown\nin figure 1(a), together with the prediction for beauty and charm production\nfrom the LO Monte Carlo program HERWIG6 , including contributions from\nresolved \u03b3 processes. Taking the normalisation from the data, a maximum\nlikelihood fit results in a beauty fraction fb = [14.7 \u00b1 3.8(stat.)] %, which\n+4.2\ntranslates into a visible cross section of [24.9 \u00b1 6.4(stat.)\u22127.3\n(syst.)] pb.

In the new analysis, the H1 cent\ntral silicon tracker CST8 is used to detect b hadrons also via their long lifetimes. In a sample of dijet \u03b3p events (Et (jet1,2 ) > 5 GeV) collected in 1997\n(L = 14.7 pb\u22121 ), 1415 muon candidates are selected, which are identified in\nthe instrumented iron and the central drift chamber and precisely measured\nin the CST. The decomposition of the sample is obtained from a likelihood fit\nto the muon signed impact parameter (\u03b4) spectrum,a which at large positive\nvalues is expected to be signal dominated. Contributions from beauty and\ncharm production are modelled by the AROMA MC program9 based on LO\nQCD and parton showers. Light quark background, dominated by misidentified hadrons (fake muons), is selected from data. The fit describes the data\nwell, cf. figure 2(a), and yields a signal contribution of fb = (26 \u00b1 5(stat.)) %.\nTranslating this into a visible cross section, the previous H1 measurement is\nconfirmed using new data and an independent signature.\n\n2\n\nMuons / 50 \u03bcm\n\n10\n\n10\n\nH1\n20\nMuons / 0.2 GeV\n\nData (prel.)\nFit\nbeauty\ncharm\nfake muons\n\nH1\n\nData (prel.)\nFit\nbeauty\ncharm + fake\n\n10\n\n1\n0\n-0.1\n\n(a)\n\n-0.05\n\n0\n0.05\n\u03b4 [ cm ]\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0\n\n1\n\n(b)\n\n2\n3\nptrel [ GeV ]\n\n4\n\n5\n\nFigure 2.

The resulting cross section in the visible range, defined by\npt (\u03bc) > 2 GeV, 35\u25e6 < \u03b8(\u03bc) < 130\u25e6 , Q2 < 1 GeV2 and 0.1 < y < 0.8 , is\nvis\n= [160 \u00b1 16 (stat.) \u00b1 29 (syst.) ] pb .\n\u03c3\u03b3p\na\n\n\u03b4 is reconstructed in the plane perpendicular to the beam. |\u03b4| is the distance of closest\napproach of the candidate track to the event primary vertex. The sign is positive if the\ntrack crosses the jet axis downstream with respect to the vertex, and negative otherwise.\n\nDIS01-proceedings: submitted to World Scientific\n\n3\n\n\fThe combination of published and new results yields a visible cross section of\n[170 \u00b1 25] pb . A NLO QCD calculation with the FMNR program7 gives a\nsignificantly lower result of [54 \u00b1 9 ] pb.1\nHaving established the new method in the photoproduction regime, it is\nfurther used to measure for the first time the open b production cross section in DIS. By reconstructing the scattered beam positron in the backward\ncalorimeter, a DIS event sample is obtained, which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of L = 10.5 pb\u22121 . After applying the same muon and\njet selection as in the photoproduction analysis and restricting the kinematic\nrange to 2 GeV2 < Q2 < 100 GeV2 and 0.05 < y < 0.7 , 171 muon candidates\nremain. The combined (\u03b4,prel\nT ) fit results in fb = (43 \u00b1 8(stat.)) % and gives a\ngood description of the data; for the prel\nT projection this is shown in figure 2(b).\nThe corresponding visible cross section is\nvis\n\u03c3DIS\n= [39 \u00b1 8 (stat.) \u00b1 10 (syst.) ] pb.\n\nThis again exceeds significantly the NLO QCD prediction of (11 \u00b1 2) pb\nobtained from the HVQDIS program.10\n4\n\nSummary\n\nOpen beauty production is measured in inclusive lepton analyses by ZEUS\nand H1 using new data and including the b lifetime signature. Previous photoproduction results are confirmed and improved, and the DIS cross section\nis measured for the first time. All measured cross sections are found to be\nabove the NLO QCD predictions. For the H1 results the excess is significant.\nReferences\n1. H1 Collab., C. Adloff et al., Phys. Lett. B 467, 156 (1999)\nand erratum (to be published).\n2. CDF Collab., F. Abe et al., Phys. Rev.
