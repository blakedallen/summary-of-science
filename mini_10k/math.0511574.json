EQUAL TO 1?\nROBIN PEMANTLE AND CARSTEN SCHNEIDER\n\nAbstract. A doubly infinite sum, numerically evaluated at between 0.999\nand 1.001, turns out to have a nice value.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe three dots in the title do not refer to an infinite sequence of 9's, but to digits\nthat are increasingly hard to compute. The question is philosophical: how many\n9's do we need to see before we start to believe that the constant we are computing\nis probably equal to 1? In our case, the constant was given by the infinite sum:\nS :=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nj,k=1\n\nHj (Hk+1 \u2212 1)\njk(k + 1)(j + k)\n\n(1)\n\nPj\nwhere Hj := i=1 (1/i) are the harmonic numbers.\nThis question in the title is beyond the scope of a mathematics journal. There\nare, however, mathematical papers proving identities that were discovered because\nnumerical computation pointed to a simple answer. The anecdotal evidence then\naccumulates in a misleading manner: when the conjectured identity is false we are\nless likely ever to know. One purpose of the present note is to document a case\nwhen we were able to evaluate the constant and it turned out not to equal the\nsimple guess (in this case, 1). In fact we will prove:\nTheorem 1:\nS\n\n:=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nj,k=1\n\nwhere \u03b6(n) =\n\nP\u221e\n\ni=1\n\nHj (Hk+1 \u2212 1)\njk(k + 1)(j + k)\n\n=\n\n\u22124\u03b6(2) \u2212 2\u03b6(3) + 4\u03b6(2)\u03b6(3) + 2\u03b6(5)\n\n=\n\n0.999222 . . .\n\n(2)\n\ni\u2212n denotes the Riemann zeta function.\n\nThe second purpose of this note is to demonstrate a piece of software that, with\na little human intervention, can find (and prove) this sort of identity.\nResearch supported in part by NSF grant # DMS-0103635 and by a Research Experiences for\nUndergraduates supplement from NSF.\nThe second author was supported by the SFB-grant F1305 of the Austrian FWF and by grant\nP16613-N12 of the Austrian FWF.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nR. PEMANTLE AND C. SCHNEIDER\n\n2. Background\nThe sum (1) arose in a paper giving bounds on the run time of the simplex\nalgorithm on a polytope known as a Klee-Minty cube [BP04]. The Klee-Minty\ncube is an example of great theoretical importance to analyses of simplex algorithm\nrun times. The derivation of the expression (1) is, however, of no importance here\nbecause S appears in [BP04] only as an upper bound, demonstrably not sharp,\nfor the leading coefficient, c, of the expected run time. The numerology of S is\ntherefore unrelated to the physical origins of c.\nOn the other hand, the form of the summation (1) does lead one at least to hope\nthat an exact value might be derived. In principle, any hypergeometric identity,\nfor example, that holds for a finite indefinite or definite sum, may be automatically\nproved via the Wilf-Zeilberger method [PWZ96], and in fact implementations of\nWZ-type software often can handle summand expressions of the complexity of (1).\nFurthermore, in many cases the WZ-machinery will not only prove but also find\nsuch an identity, if it exists, given only the left hand side. This, in general, does not\nextend to summations over summands involving no extra parameter: if S were to\nequal 1, that fact would not necessarily be automatically detectable. The relatively\nsimple form of the summand, however, gave us hope that summation\nP tricks more\nspecific to harmonic series might unlock the problem (the identity 1/(n(n+1)) =\n1 stands as a beacon of hope). Indeed, several telescoping and re-summation tricks\nwere initially tried, removing all but one infinite summation in various ways. These\nidentities were useful in improving our numerical bounds on S.\nThe numerical bounds we had on S were not all that good. It should be noted\nthat the harmonic numbers are themselves sums, so the expression (1) is really a\nquadruple sum. This makes it perhaps less surprising that our best rigorous bounds\nwere no closer that 10\u22123 . To make a long story short, summing in one variable,\nthen using exact values for thousands of row and column sums and an integral\napproximation for the remaining terms, led to our best rigorous bounds, namely\n0.999197 \u2264 S \u2264 1.00093 .\nAt this point, although the exact value of S was of no use to us, we felt embarrassed\nto publish numerical bounds on a constant that we suspected was equal to 1. The\nauthors of [BP04] then consulted the experts in harmonic summation, who consulted their computers, and came up with Theorem 1. The remainder of this note\nproves Theorem 1.\n3. Solving the Problem\nIf a sum such as (1) has a nice value, it does not necessarily follow that a\ntruncated version of the sum has a nice formula. But, if it has a nice closed form,\nautomatic methods might succeed in finding it by first computing a recurrence and\nafterwards searching for solutions of the recurrence in which the closed form can\nbe represented. Thus we consider a truncated version of the sum, namely,\nS(a, b) =\n\na\nb\nX\nHk+1 \u2212 1 X\nk=1\n\nk(k + 1)\n\nj=1\n\nHj\n,\nj(j + k)\n\nthat is, the upper limits, instead of being infinite, are taken to be integer variables,\na and b. In this case, our optimism is rewarded: we will be able to simplify the inner\n\n\fWHEN IS 0.999 . . . EQUAL TO 1?\n\n3\n\nsum so that we can sum a second time if we make some alterations that disappear\nwhen the upper limit goes to infinity.\nThe inner sum. In a first step we compute a closed form evaluation of the inner\nsum\na\nX\nf (k, j)\nh(a, k) :=\nj=1\n\nH\n\nj\nwith f (k, j) := j(j+k)\n. Here we follow the summation principles given in [Sch04]\nthat are inspired by [PWZ96]. Note that all the computations are carried out with\nthe summation package Sigma in the computer algebra system Mathematica. The\nrole of the computer here is to produce equations which we may then rapidly and\nrigorously verify.\nOur first step is to compute for the definite sum h(a, k) the recurrence relation\n\nk 2 h(a, k) \u2212 (k + 1)(2k + 1) h(a, k + 1)\n+ (k + 1)(k + 2) h(a, k + 2) =\n\na(a + k + 2) \u2212 (a + 1)(k + 1)Ha\n(k + 1)(a + k + 1)(a + k + 2)\n\n(3)\n\nwith a variation of Zeilberger's creative telescoping trick.\nThe way we find this is to guess that there is some r and some constants c0 , . . . , cr\ndepending on k but not j, and some function g(k, j) which we assume to have a\nrelatively simple form, such that a relation\nr\nX\n\ncs f (k + s, j) = g(k, j + 1) \u2212 g(k, j)\n\ns=0\n\nholds for all k, j \u2265 1. We ask Sigma to find such a relation for various classes of\nfunctions g and for r = 1, 2, . . ., until we achieve success with r = 2, c0 (k) = k 2 ,\njHj +k+j\nc1 (k) = \u2212(k + 1)(2k + 1), c2 (k) = (k + 1)(k + 2), and g(k, j) = \u2212 (k+j)(k+j+1)\n. We\nmay then verify the relation\nc0 (k)f (k, j) + c1 (k)f (k + 1, j) + c2 (k)f (k + 2, j) = g(k, j + 1) \u2212 g(k, j)\nby polynomial arithmetic and by using the relation Hj+1 = Hj +\nover k in the interval {1, . . . , a} proves (3).\nNext we are in the position to discover and prove that\n(2)\n\nh(a, k) =\n\n(2)\n\nkHk2 \u2212 2Hk + kHk + 2kHa\n2k 2\n\n\u2212\n\n1\nj+1 .\n\n(4)\n\nSumming (4)\n\nk\ni\nk\n(kHa \u2212 1) X 1\n1X1X 1\n\u2212\nk2\na + i k i=1 i j=1 a + j\ni=1\n\n(5)\nPk\n(r)\nholds for all a, k \u2265 1; here Hk = i=1 i1r denotes the generalized harmonic\nnumbers.\nWe do this by asking Sigma to find solutions to (3) for all k \u2265 1 and then to\nplug in the initial conditions, which in this case, are to match the values of h(a, k)\nfor k = 1, 2; see [Sch04] for further details. Once Sigma has found the expression\non the right hand side of (5), it is again a finite exercise in polynomial arithmetic\nto verify that it satisfies (3), and that it satisfies the two initial conditions. Since r\ninitial conditions uniquely determine the solution, we have proved (5).\n\n\f4\n\nR. PEMANTLE AND C. SCHNEIDER\n\nSome terms vanish in the limit. At some point, if we do not winnow out some\nterms that will disappear in the limit, our computer will begin to balk. Luckily it\nis easy to identify some terms that will contribute o(1) to the definite sum as a and\nb go to infinity, and may therefore be ignored in the evaluation of S. We have, for\nexample, the elementary estimates\nk\n1 X 1\n= 0,\na\u2192\u221e k 2\na+i\ni=1\n\nlim\n\nk\nHa X 1\n= 0 and\na\u2192\u221e k\na+i\ni=1\n\nlim\n\nk\ni\n1X1X 1\n= 0.\na\u2192\u221e k\ni j=1 a + j\ni=1\n\nlim\n\n(6)\nHence, if we define\nS \u2032 (a, b) :=\n\nb\n(2)\n(2)\nX\nHk+1 \u2212 1 kH 2 \u2212 2Hk + kH + 2kHa\nk\n\nk=1\n\nk\n\n2k 2\n\nk(k + 1)\n\n,\n\n(7)\n\nwe have\nlim S \u2032 (a, b) = S\n\na,b\u2192\u221e\n\nby (5) and (6). Summarizing, problem (2) from above reduces to find and prove\nthe identity\nlim S \u2032 (a, b) = \u22124\u03b6(2) \u2212 2\u03b6(3) + 4\u03b6(2)\u03b6(3) + 2\u03b6(5).\n\n(8)\n\na,b\u2192\u221e\n\nThe outer sum. Our next step is guided by the fact that we know a few infinite\nsums in which the nth summand is of the form n\u2212c times a monomial in the har(p)\nmonic and generalized harmonic numbers Hn and Hn . While we cannot solve the\ngeneral problem of summing all such univariate series, it makes sense to attempt to\nmanipulate things into this form. Thus we ask Sigma to try to write the summand\nof the right hand side of (7) in the form g(a, k) \u2212 g(a, k \u2212 1) where the only infinite\nsums that appear in g are of the form described above. The program obligingly\nproduces the function g(a, k) = A(a, k) + B(a, k) + C(a, k) where A, B and C are\ngiven by\n\u0010\n1\n2\n2\n3\n3\n(2)\n(9)\nA(a, b) :=\n2 6Hb + 4bHb + 4Hb + 3bHb + Hb + bHb \u2212 6bHa\n2(b + 1)\n\u0011\n(2)\n(2)\n(2)\n(2)\n+2Hb Ha(2) + 2bHb Ha(2) \u2212 2Hb \u2212 7bHb + Hb Hb + bHb Hb ,\nB(a, b) :=\n\n\u2212\n\n2b2\n2\n\n(b + 1)\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(2)\nHa(2) + Hb\n\n(10)\n\nand\nC(a, b) :=\n\n(Ha(2) \u2212 1)\n\nb\nX\nHi\ni=1\n\ni2\n\n\u2212\n\nb\nX\nH2\ni=1\n\ni\ni3\n\nb\n\n+\n\nb\n\n(2)\n\n1 X Hi3\n1 X Hi Hi\n+\n.\n2 i=1 i2\n2 i=1\ni2\n\n(11)\n\nThis time the correctness of the result supplied by Sigma is verified by polynomial\narithmetic and the definition of Hk without need to appeal to any uniqueness results\nfor solutions to recurrences.\n\n\fWHEN IS 0.999 . . .

The number a1 , . . . , ak need not be increasing, but it is\nrequired that a1 \u2265 2, because this is the condition for the sum to be finite.\n(p )\nOne may expand each Hn j of (14), and in this way the general Euler sum\nbecomes the sum of j1\u2212p1 * * * jk\u2212pk n\u2212q over all (k +1)-tuples satisfying n \u2265 j1 , . . . , jk .\nDecomposing according to the set of distinct values among j1 , . . . , jk , n produces\nan expression for Sp1 ,...,pk ;q that is a linear combination of multiple \u03b6-values with\nweight q + p1 + * * * + pk and multiplicity at most k + 1. In the same way, one sees\nthat any product of Euler sums or multiple \u03b6-values is itself a linear combination\nof multiple \u03b6-values.\nTo illustrate, these ideas, we write C as a sum of products of Euler sums and\nthen change these, term by term, into multiple \u03b6-values. From the definitions,\n1\n1\nC = S\u2205;2 S1;2 \u2212 S1;2 \u2212 S1,1;3 + S1,1,1;2 + S1,2;2 .\n2\n2\nOf course S\u2205;2 = \u03b6(2). Next,\nX\nX\nX\nS1;2 =\nn\u22122 j \u22121 =\nn\u22123 +\nn\u22122 j \u22121 = \u03b6(3) + \u03b6(2, 1) .\nn\u2265j\u22651\n\nn\u22651\n\nn>j\u22651\n\n\f6\n\nR. PEMANTLE AND C. SCHNEIDER\n\nThe remaining values are\nS1,1;3\nS1,1,1;2\nS1,2;2\n\n= 2\u03b6(3, 1, 1) + \u03b6(3, 2) + 2\u03b6(4, 1) + \u03b6(5)\n= 6\u03b6(2, 1, 1, 1) + 3\u03b6(2, 2, 1) + 3\u03b6(2, 1, 2)\n+6\u03b6(3, 1, 1) + 3\u03b6(3, 2) + 3\u03b6(4, 1) + \u03b6(5)\n= \u03b6(2, 2, 1) + \u03b6(2, 1, 2) + \u03b6(3, 2) + \u03b6(4, 1) + \u03b6(5) .\n\nThese are derived in the same way as S1;2 , for example,\nX\nS1,1;3 =\nn\u22123 j \u22121 k \u22121\nn\u2265j,k\u22651\n\nwhere the triples decompose into n = j = k, n = j \u2265 k, n = k \u2265 j, n > j = k, n >\nj > k and n > k > j. Putting this all together gives\nC\n\n= (\u03b6(2) \u2212 1)(\u03b6(3) + \u03b6(2, 1)) + \u03b6(3, 1, 1) + \u03b6(3, 2) + 3\u03b6(2, 1, 1, 1)\n+2\u03b6(2, 2, 1) + 2\u03b6(2, 1, 2) + \u03b6(2, 3) .\n\n(15)\n\nThe decomposition of products of \u03b6-values and multiple \u03b6-values into linear combinations of multiple \u03b6-values is entirely analogous, for instance,\n\u03b6(2)\u03b6(3) = \u03b6(2, 3) + \u03b6(3, 2) + \u03b6(5) .\n\n(16)\n\nReducing to ordinary \u03b6-values. Theorem 1 indicates that reduction to single\n\u03b6-values is possible. This is worthwhile, because the single \u03b6-values may be more\neasily and accurately obtained than may multiple \u03b6-values. For example, Maple\ncomputes 500 digits of \u03b6(5) in under 10 seconds.\nAs it happens, some Euler sums and multiple \u03b6-values may be represented as\nsums of products of single \u03b6-values. Others, it appears, may not, though this is\nnot proved and no algorithm is known for determining which Euler sums or which\nmultiple \u03b6-values may be represented in this way. For large k, the number of Qlinearly independent multiple \u03b6-values of weight k is conjectured\nby Zagier to grow\n\u221a\nlike 1.32k [FS98, page 17], which outstrips the dimension eO( k) of the monomials\n\u03b6(k1 ) * * * \u03b6(km ) in single \u03b6-values of total degree k = k1 + * * * + km . However,\nk = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9, the dimensions are known to be equal, and hence every\nmultiple \u03b6-value of these weights is a polynomial over Q in single \u03b6-values.\nAmong the known relations, two classes suffice for our problem, namely the sum\nand duality relations. The sum relation of degree k says that the sum of all multiple\n\u03b6-values of fixed multiplicity m and weight k is equal to \u03b6(k). For k = 3, 5 and\nm = 2, these are\n\u03b6(3)\n\u03b6(5)\n\n= \u03b6(2, 1)\n= \u03b6(4, 1) + \u03b6(3, 2) + \u03b6(2, 3) .\n\nThe sum relations were conjectured by Moen [Hof92, Section 3], known in special\ncases to Euler [Eul27], and proved by [Gra97].\nSecondly, one has the duality theorem, conjectured by [Hof92] and proved by\n[Zag94]. These imply equality between \u03b6(p1 , . . . , pk ) and \u03b6(q1 , . . . , ql ) of equal\nweights when the index sequences are related by an operation akin to transposing a partition. The exact definition is given in, e.g., [FS98, page 29] but all we\nwill need to here is to represent the multiple \u03b6-values of weight 5 and multiplicity 3\n\n\fWHEN IS 0.999 . . . EQUAL TO 1?\n\n7\n\nand 4 in terms of those of multiplicity 2:\n\u03b6(2, 2, 1) =\n\n\u03b6(3, 2)\n\n\u03b6(2, 1, 2) =\n\u03b6(3, 1, 1) =\n\n\u03b6(2, 3)\n\u03b6(4, 1)\n\n\u03b6(2, 1, 1, 1) =\n\n\u03b6(5) .\n\nUsing the duality relations to eliminate all terms of multiplicity greater than 2\nfrom (15), and then using (16), gives\nC = (\u03b6(2) \u2212 1)(\u03b6(3) + \u03b6(2, 1)) + \u03b6(4, 1) + 3\u03b6(2)\u03b6(3) .\nThe sum relations now yield\nC = 4\u03b6(2)\u03b6(3) \u2212 2\u03b6(3) + 2\u03b6(5) ,\nwhich finishes the proof of Theorem 1.\nWe remark that one more relation is needed to reduce all multiple \u03b6-values of\nweight 5 to polynomials in single \u03b6-values, namely\n11\n\u03b6(5) ,\n(17)\n2\nbut that our expression for C can be simplified in terms of single \u03b6-values without (17). This identity (17) can be produced by a formula in [BBG95] which can\ntransform any double \u03b6-value with odd weight to a polynomial in single \u03b6-values.\n\u03b6(3, 2) = 3\u03b6(2)\u03b6(3) \u2212\n\n4.
