Introduction\nInflation probably explains the origin of our universe [1]. A concrete realization of this\nscenario in superstring theory is brane inflation [2, 3, 4]. The simplest version involves\nan interacting D3-D3-brane system in which the D3-brane moves towards the D3-brane\nsitting at the bottom of a warped throat, with the position of the mobile D3-brane\ncorresponding to the inflaton. Inflation ends when the D3-brane and the D3-brane collide\nand annihilate, initiating the hot big bang. Cosmic strings are copiously produced during\nthe epoch of annihilation [5, 6]. These strings are simply superstrings (F- and D-strings\nand their bound states [7, 8, 9]) stretched to cosmological sizes. Finding evidence for the\nexistence of these strings would go a long way towards confirming certain fundamental\naspects of superstring theory [10, 11].\nThe single most important property of a cosmic string is its tension \u03bc, or, in dimensionless terms, the characteristic gravitational potential G\u03bc/c2 [12] (hereafter, we will\ntake c = 1). An initial estimate of the range of tension produced towards the end of\n\u22126\ninflation gave 10\u221211 <\n\u223c G\u03bc <\n\u223c 10 [6]. A recent analysis of the reheating that accompanies\nbrane inflation, including multi-brane multi-throat scenarios, suggests that G\u03bc < 10\u221211\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fis quite possible [13]. The properties of the cosmic superstrings produced at the end of\ninflation are compatible with all observations today but are beginning to be constrained\nby observational data [14, 15, 16]. The actual bound is sensitive to the details of the\n\u22127\nstring tension spectrum and the probability of string-string interactions but G\u03bc <\n\u223c 10\ngives a rough idea of current observational constraints.\nFor small G\u03bc, it will be very challenging to detect cosmic string signatures in lensing, gravitational wave bursts, pulsar timing and B mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background radiation by methods that have been investigated hitherto. However, even low G\u03bc strings produce double images of point-like objects. Here, we will\ninvestigate the utility of microlensing of stars to learn about the string content of the\nuniverse. The propensity to microlens depends, of course, upon the number of lenses\nand their cross section for bending light. Our current understanding of string network\nevolution implies that the rate of lensing increases as G\u03bc decreases. This happy circumstance may eventually lead to practical experiments to detect superstrings. Microlensing\nof stars is much more promising than microlensing of quasars [17].\nAlthough it is well accepted that cosmic strings evolve to a scaling network [18],\nstring network evolution is by no means well understood. Even if one had a complete\nknowledge of the intrinsic string tensions in string theory, the cosmological evolution of\nthe string network remains a challenging problem [11]. Recent analyses strongly suggest\nthat cosmic superstrings evolve dynamically so as to produce a scaling solution in which\nthere exists a stable relative distribution of strings with different quantum numbers\n[19, 20]. This is very much like the behavior of cosmic strings generated by abelian\nHiggs or Nambu-Goto type models [18, 12]. The superstring solutions found in current\nstring theory, however, form a much larger class which is only now being explored.\nA scaling solution implies the fractions of the critical energy density in long strings\nand loops are constant. In fact, the determination of \u03a9long and \u03a9loop has been an outstanding question for some time [12]. Numerical simulations for cosmic strings may be\nfitted by\np\n(1.1)\n\u03a9s \u2261 \u03a9long + \u03a9loop = \u03c8G\u03bc + \u03c7 G\u03bc\n\nfor constants \u03c8 and \u03c7. A small isolated loop of length l will decay in a characteristic time\n\u03c4 = l/(\u0393G\u03bc) and \u0393 \u223c 50 for Nambu-Goto strings. A common assumption made in many\nsimulations is that small loops are produced by the intersection of long strings (including\nself intersection). For H\u03c4 << 1 where H is the Hubble constant the loops decay quickly\nvia gravitational radiation and \u03a9s \u223c \u03a9long \u223c \u03c8G\u03bc; the loop contribution is negligible.\nNumerical simulations show \u03c8 \u223c \u0393. Presumably, this is a good approximation for G\u03bc\nclose to the present day observational bound.\nSeveral new considerations have emerged from the latest simulations and from theoretical work.\n\u2022 Loops dominate: For small G\u03bc newly formed loops do not immediately dissipate.\nThe latest simulations [21, 25, 24] imply a loop distribution which, if truncated by\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fgravitational wave damping, yields a qualitatively new effect: \u03a9s \u223c \u03a9loop >> \u03a9long .\n\u2022 Small scales on long strings: Analytic work [29, 11] shows that the stretching\nof long strings is insufficient to prevent the development of small scale structure.\nCollisions of long strings may produce large numbers of loops of all sizes. Estimates\nindicate \u223c 10% of the long string length ends up in loops with scale comparable\nto the horizon. Loops with H\u03c4 >\n\u223c 1 contribute to \u03a9s .\n\u2022 Backreaction of small scales: When \u03a9loop increases, small loops can recombine\nto form bigger loops and, likewise, isolated loops may be incorporated into long\nstrings. The determination of the scaling solution when energy can flow up and\ndown a hierarchy of scales is an outstanding problem.\n\u2022 Damping of loops vs long strings: Analytic work [26, 27] indicates that the rate of\ndamping of modes on long strings differs from \u0393G\u03bc, the characteristic loss rate for\nan isolated loop. Under such circumstances the network- and time-averaged gravitational energy loss rate per mode is coupled to the details of the intercommutation\nprocess.\nThese factors motivate the development of a very approximate description of the\nstring network when the tension is low. Specifically, we extend the analysis of Olum\net al. in Ref.[21] to describe the loop population for small G\u03bc. We also parameterize\nthe effective decay rate of loops in the network by \u0393R G\u03bc where, in general, we expect\n\u0393R < \u0393 \u223c 50.\nThis minimal quantitative framework is used to begin an investigation of microlensing by loops. Lensing by cosmic string loops at cosmological distances was considered\noriginally in [31, 32]. The analyses focused on G\u03bc \u223c 10\u22126 and the possibility that the\nlensing might produce multiple images of QSOs. The situation of interest here is quite\ndifferent though the physical process, gravitational lensing, remains the same as was\noriginally discussed in these papers. We shall first give a brief sketch of the latest status of the cosmic string network. We shall outline the form of the loop distribution\nwhich is presented in full detail in the Appendix. We shall then use the result to estimate the event rates and the detectability of microlensing for the cosmic strings. While\nmany properties of superstrings and astrophysics remain unaccounted for (specifically,\nthe intercommutation probability and the collisional interactions within the Galaxy) this\napproach highlights the role of lowering G\u03bc and sets a benchmark that we will refine as\nthe input physics is better understood.\nOur analysis shows that the intrinsic rate of microlensing increases as tension decreases. At the same time the detection efficiency for a microlensing event diminishes\nbecause both the duration of the event and also the size of the deficit angle diminish.1\n1\n\nThe deficit angle due to the string must be bigger than the angle subtended by a star. For typical\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fTo illustrate the potential utility for detecting cosmic string microlensing of stars,\nwe consider the upcoming European Gaia mission [22]. Gaia is primarily an astrometry\nsatellite designed to measure proper motions and parallaxes of about 109 stars in and\nnear the Galaxy over a 5 year period. The satellite records the flux for each star and it\nis this feature which is of greatest interest to us. On average each star will be observed\n80 times; individual observations take about \u223c 3 seconds. The expected accuracy of the\nphotometry from a single observation is easily sufficient to see a factor of 2 change in\nflux from one observation to the next. Using a crude model of detection efficiency, we\nfind that an instrument like Gaia would be able to detect microlensing events for cosmic\nstrings in the Galaxy: a few events for G\u03bc \u223c 10\u221210 to a few dozens for G\u03bc \u223c 10\u22128. This\nestimate invokes several conservative choices including the value of \u0393R ; the event rate\nincreases for \u0393R < \u0393.\nA key reason for this detectable rate is the over-density of loops in the Galaxy.\nEven small loops can survive a Hubble time when the tension is low. A generally new\nscenario for cosmic string evolution now unfolds: the velocity of the center of mass of\na loop decreases on account of cosmic drag; loop-loop interactions freeze out. Loops\nsubsequently behave like cold dark matter, slowly radiating gravitational waves. Most\nof the loops of interest for microlensing were born during the radiation era and fall into\ngravitational perturbations that begin to grow after equipartition. In particular, the\nloops track the perturbations of the cold dark matter. This clumping enhances the local\nloop density by at least a factor of \u223c 105 .\nFrom the string theory point of view, the true lensing rate may be enhanced above\nour estimate because the intercommutation probability of superstrings may be as small\nas P \u223c 10\u22123 [19]. Also, cosmic superstrings come in a variety of tensions and charges\nso that a number of species are present in the network [20]. These effects will tend to\nincrease the energy density throughout the universe in the superstring network in eq.\n(1.1) roughly like \u03a9s \u2192 n\u03a9s /P , where n is the effective number of types, n \u223c 5. The\nspectrum of cosmic superstrings yields a discrete set of tensions that can easily vary by\nan order of magnitude.\nFrom an astrophysical point of view, the true lensing rate may be enhanced by\ndissipative loop-halo interactions that boost the galactic loop density and it may be\ndiminished by the collisional interaction of loops once they begin to clump in the Galaxy.\nIntercommutation might chop up small loops into smaller loops and shorten their lifetime\nto gravitational wave emission. This, in turn, may diminish the part of the spectrum\nresponsible for most of the lensing while increasing the locally generated gravitational\n\u221214\nsources (a solar mass main sequence star within the halo) this is roughly G\u03bc >\n\u223c 10 . Likewise, the\nduration \u03b4tlens of the shortest detectable optical microlensing event is limited by, among other things,\nthe ability to detect a factor of 2 change in the number of the source photons. If we assume a typical\nsource (a solar mass star at distance 10 kpc), a broadband instrument detecting photons near the peak\nof the spectrum (\u223c 1 eV), a typical instrument (a 10% efficient meter-class telescope), then we can\n\u221214\nestimate that a 5\u03c3 detection requires \u03b4tlens >\n\u223c 10 .\n\u223c 40 ms. This corresponds to roughly G\u03bc >\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fwave background. We have not included either the dissipation or the interaction in our\nmicrolensing estimates but will return to these issues in the future.\n\n2. String Network\nWe shall start by considering cosmological cosmic strings like Nambu-Goto strings or\nvortices in an abelian Higgs model. One readily identifies two components, long horizoncrossing segments and sub-horizon closed loops. Only straight strings are static; all\nothers are dynamic with relativistic motion. Even isolated loops oscillate in a highly\ncomplicated fashion. A network of long strings and loops can change topology by the\nprocess of intercommutation, the breaking and rejoining experienced when the motions\nof two segments of string cause them to coincide in 3D space. This process can fragment\nas well as rejoin the basic elements of the string network. Self intersections of a long\nstring cuts off new loops, self intersections of a loop transforms it to multiple loops,\netc. Conversely, inverse processes allow loops to reconnect to long strings and loops to\nreconnect with other loops. In the cosmological context the processes of intercommutation, damping (e.g. gravitational wave emission) and cosmological expansion govern the\nstring network evolution.\nWhen a network exhibits scaling behavior the energy density (either long or loop)\nis a fixed fraction of the critical energy density eq. (1.1). When very small loops are\nformed and decay promptly the critical density\n\u03a9s \u223c \u03a9long \u223c \u03c8G\u03bc\n\n(2.1)\n\nand simulations show \u03c8 \u223c \u0393 where \u0393 \u223c 50 for abelian strings. The scaling solution\ndepends upon \u0393 in an indirect way. Small scale structure on the long strings is damped\nby gravitational wave emission with rate \u221d \u0393G\u03bc if one assumes modes damp like those\nof an isolated loop. An intersection of two long string segments is more dissipative if it\nconverts a greater overall length to small loops. In fact, more loops are produced if the\nsegment possesses more small scale structure. The dissipation per collision of long string\nsegments, therefore, scales \u221d 1/\u0393G\u03bc. The rate for one segment of a horizon-crossing\nstring to encounter another \u221d \u03a9long . Therefore, the total dissipation rate per long string\nsegment \u221d \u03a9long /\u0393G\u03bc. A fixed rate of dissipation per string is essential to achieve a\nscaling solution in the first place, so that \u03a9long \u221d \u0393G\u03bc.\nThe specific scenario above depends on the H\u03c4 << 1 where H is the Hubble constant,\n\u03c4 = l/\u0393G\u03bc is the damping time and l is the loop size. In a scaling solution a typical loop\nformed at time t has size l \u223c \u03b1t where \u03b1 is constant so \u03b1/\u0393G\u03bc << 1 is required. The\nvalue of \u03b1 is poorly known; \u03b1 < 10\u221212 is sometimes invoked [12] but recent numerical\nsimulations [23, 28] and analytic studies [29] suggest that loops with a range of sizes\n10\u22124 <\n\u223c\u03b1<\n\u223c 0.25 are created. Lower tension implies longer damping time so that the\nprompt loop decay which is characteristic of the scenario above is now more difficult to\nachieve.\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fTo build a model capable of describing the loop distribution for small G\u03bc we follow\nthe line of reasoning of Olum et al. [21]. In the radiation or matter-dominated eras the\nnumber of loops produced per unit loop length per unit volume per unit time has the\nform\ndN(l, t)\n= t\u22125 f (x)\nwith x = l/t\n(2.2)\ndldtdV\nfor some function f (x) for a scaling solution.2 Numerical simulation in Ref.[23, 28]\nsuggest a power law distribution of loops\nf (x) = Ax\u2212\u03b2\n\nfor x < \u03b1\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere \u03b1t is the largest loop scale and \u03b2 < 2. The constants A, \u03b1 and \u03b2 may be extracted\nfrom time-dependent simulations for cosmic strings which appear to have entered a\nscaling regime.\nAssume that in each infinitesimal time interval (t, t + dt) the network produces the\nloops described with l < \u03b1t according to dN/dldtdV and these are subsequently diluted\nby cosmological expansion without further intercommutation. This is an instantaneous\nfragmentation description adjusted to agree with the results of time-dependent simulations that model the complete process. A non-interacting loop shrinks by gravitational\nwave emission until it disappears in time l/(\u0393R G\u03bc). Note the introduction of \u0393R in the\ndimensionless decay rate in place of \u0393 \u223c 50. Here, \u0393R < \u0393 implies that loops live longer\nbecause of complex unmodeled network effects. For example, in the conventional view,\na loop of size l emits energy at half the total rate of two loops of size l/2. In addition,\n[26, 27] find that the damping rate of long strings is \u221d (G\u03bc)k with k > 1. For the simple\nenergy loss recipes employed it makes a great deal of difference whether a length is part\nof a small loop, a large loop or a long, horizon-crossing string. We do not attempt to\ndisentangle these effects but simply introduce \u0393R as an effective damping rate.\nThe superstrings differ from previously studied cosmic strings in fundamental characteristics like G\u03bc and P and possibly in the resultant loop distribution described by A,\n\u03b1 and \u03b2. It is tricky to extrapolate to describe domains not previously simulated. Our\ncalculation of the distribution function for loops is given in detail in Appendix 1. The\ngeneral idea is as follows: When the network scales the long strings are chopped to loops\nwhose total length is a constant fraction of the horizon. Energy conservation implies\nR\nthat f xdx is fixed. If the typical loop size \u03b1 were to be modified (for example, because\nthe intercommutation probability is decreased), then this energy conservation argument\ngives A \u221d \u03b1\u03b2\u22122 . Using this reasoning we can, in principle, consider various descriptions\nfor f , cosmological expansion dynamics, \u0393R and G\u03bc. The minimal assumption is that\n(1 \u2212 hv 2 i)/\u03b3s2 is the same for undamped Nambu-Goto strings in Minkowski space as for\ndamped superstring networks in FRW cosmology; here, the characteristic inter-string\n2\n\nThis form does not apply during the recent, \u039b-dominated phase since the horizon is not \u221d t. The\nloops of direct interest to us are from earlier epochs.\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fdistance d(t) = \u03b3s t and hv 2 i is the square of the string velocity averaged over the length\nof long strings. For our applications, however, we also assume the simulation-derived\nquantities like \u03b2 are fixed and concentrate on changes to the network that arise from\nvarying G\u03bc, \u0393R and the cosmological dynamics.\nAt any time the distribution of non-interacting loops in a given volume is the integrated production rate over the history of the universe\nZ\ndN\n1\ndN\n=\nV (t\u2032 )dt\u2032\n(2.4)\ndldV\nV\ndldV dt\u2032\nsubject to upper and lower cutoffs. The upper cutoff corresponds to the time when\ngravitational wave damping removes the loop; the lower cutoff is the earliest epoch when\nthe loop might be produced. If the expansion scale factor varies a \u221d tn then the integrand\n\u221d t3n+\u03b2\u22125 . For both radiation and matter dominated eras, the loop distribution at length\nl is typically dominated by production at early times t = l/\u03b1 (this requires \u03b2 < 7/2 or\n3, respectively) so that\ndN\nl3n\u22124\n\u221d 3n 3n\u22122\n(2.5)\ndldV\nt \u03b1\nas previously demonstrated by Vanchurin et al. [28]. This distribution may then be\ncompared to the cosmological simulation results [25, 24]. None of the simulations incorporate gravitational damping so that the cutoff at small loop size in the simulations\nreflects either initial conditions, finite resolution and/or finite simulation times. Nonetheless, the results at various epochs illustrates the buildup of a powerlaw distribution of\nloops at intermediate scales with the predicted slope. In the radiation era, for example,\neq. (2.5) gives dN/dldV \u221d l\u22122.5 while the simulations of Ringeval et al. [25] imply\ndN/dldV \u221d l\u22122.6 .\nThe energy density, lensing probability and lensing rate of loops all involve essentially\nR\ndN\nthe same moment of the loop distribution, ldl dldV\n. The cutoff l = \u0393R G\u03bct is the key\nparameter which varies with the tension when we evaluate those quantities.

Assume that the slope and amplitude of the simulation-derived loop\ndistribution is extended to the gravitational cutoff and that the long string density is\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\ffixed.

The evaluation of the lensing probability and\nrate involves the same integrals which depend on the gravitational wave damping cutoff\nin the same way. When strings have low tension loops, not horizon crossing strings, are\nthe favored lensing candidates.\nThe appendix treats general powerlaw forms for f with upper and lower cutoffs (\u03b1U ,\n\u03b1L ) and various slopes (\u03b2) and, most significantly, various G\u03bc and radiation loss rates \u0393R .\nIt gives approximate expressions valid for loops from both radiation and matter epochs.\nIt compares the simple analytic approximations to more realistic \u039b-CDM cosmologies.\nIt provides a range of numerical solutions illustrating how the loop distribution varies\nwith \u03bc, \u0393R , \u03b2, \u03b1L and \u03b1U .\nAs mentioned earlier, cosmic superstrings have different properties from cosmic\nstrings. The intercommutation probability of vortices is known to be around unity,\nP \u2243 1, while that of superstrings is rather complicated, but P \u223c gs2 [19], where the\nstring coupling gs \u223c 1/10. Also, cosmic superstrings come in a variety of tensions and\ncharges so that a number of species are present in the network [20]. These effects likely\nincrease the energy density in the superstring network compared to its cosmic strings\ncounterpart roughly\nn\n(2.9)\n\u03a9s \u2192 \u03a9s\nP\nwhere n is the effective number of types, n \u223c 5. For very small P , it has been argued\nthat 1/P \u2192 1/P 2/3 [30]. The implication is that the number density of small cosmic\nsuperstring loops will be boosted with respect to cosmic strings.\n\n3. Microlensing\nMicrolensing refers to brightness variations of a background source caused by a changing\ngravitational field somewhere along the line of sight. The field may be generated by a\ndark point-like object and the astrophysically anticipated candidates include dim stars,\nwhite dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. The paths of photons emitted by the source\nare bent so that the angular area of the source visible to the observer changes. In short,\nthe flux from the source changes. The key point is that one does not have to resolve the\nsource or the lens to observe the change. Lensing distorts a single source image or, if the\nimpact parameter of the photon is within the Einstein radius, lensing creates multiple\nimages. The area within the Einstein radius is quite small so its much more common\nfor magnification of a single image to occur than the creation of multiple images. If\nsource, lens and observer have constant velocities, the time-dependent magnification has\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fan a priori known functional form. Previous surveys (MACHO, OGLE, EROS, etc.)\nhave searched for and identified numerous events with the expected time-dependent\nachromatic form.\nNow, instead of the normal astrophysical lensing candidates, consider a stationary\nstraight infinite string oriented perpendicular to the observer's line of sight with respect\nto a background source. Let two photons from the source travel toward the string.\nThe photons do not suffer any relative deflection during the fly-by as long as they pass\naround the string in the same sense. Images formed from photons are undistorted. This\ncontrasts with the shear and distortion produced by a point mass.\nHowever, there is a small angular region just like the Einstein radius that yields\nmultiple images as long as the source itself is small in angular size compared to the\nEinstein radius. In essence, some of the photons pass around the the string in a clockwise\nsense and others do so in a counterclockwise sense. Two paths from the source to the\nobserver yield two undistorted images.\nSources that lie behind the string and within the characteristic angle \u223c 8\u03c0G\u03bc will\nappear as double images. Unresolved, lensed sources will appear to fluctuate in brightness\nby a factor of 2 as the angular region associated with the string passes across the observersource line of sight. The characteristic Einstein angle is\n\u0398E = 8\u03c0G\u03bc\n= 1.04 \u00d7 10\n\n\u22123\n\n\u0012\n\nG\u03bc\n2 \u00d7 10\u221210\n\n\u0013\n\narcsec.\n\n(3.1)\n\nThe characteristic angular size of a stellar source at distance R is \u0398\u2299 = R\u2299 /R.

For a loop, as opposed to a\nstraight string, one expects lensing like that of a point mass for photons with impact\nparameter large compared to the size of the loop and lensing like that of a straight string\nfor paths that pass close to a segment of the string. We will eschew the complications\nassociated with small scale structure on the string and concentrate on photons that pass\nclose to a smooth segment of the loop.\nThe characteristic scale of the smallest loops today is\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0012\nttoday\n\u0393R G\u03bc\n.\n(3.3)\nlg = \u0393R G\u03bcttoday = 41pc\n10\u22128\n13.5Gyr\nand the characteristic mass scale associated with such a loop is\n\u0012\n\u00132 \u0012 \u0013\nG\u03bc\n\u0393R\n5\nMg = 1.7 \u00d7 10 M\u2299\n\u221210\n2 \u00d7 10\n50\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n(3.4)\n\n\fboth of which are small compared to Galactic scales.\nFor comparison, the characteristic scale of the loops formed at equipartition is\n\u0013\n\u0012\nteq\n.\n(3.5)\nlmax,eq = \u03b1U teq = \u03b1U 14kpc\n4.7 \u00d7 104 yrs\nGalactic scales are R \u223c 1 \u2212 100 kpc and microlensing can probe the full range of loops\ngenerated during the radiation era plus the small end of the loops generated during the\nmatter era. All this assumes \u03b1U order unity. Generally, the internal velocities associated\nwith loops are relativistic.\nWe want to answer two questions: What is the probability for lensing a single source\nat distance R by a distribution of loops at a given instant? How does the probability\ngrow with time?\nConsider a small loop of size l at distance r. It lenses an angular area \u03a9L \u223c (\u03b8E r)l/r 2 .\nThe probability that a single background source at distance R is lensed is the ratio of\nthe lensed angular area to the observed angular area in the direction of the source.

Cosmology of Small G\u03bc Loops\nThe center of mass velocity of string loops within the galaxy is a key parameter in\ncharacterizing the lensing rate for two reasons. First, if the velocity is less than the\ncharacteristic escape velocity from the Galaxy vh then loops will accrete and be bound\nto the halo. Second, if the velocity of small loops is much less than c then a single source\nis lensed multiple times.\nThe initial loop velocity is determined by the interactions in the string network.\nIntercommutations between string segments can generate relativistic center of mass motions for the newly formed loops. Our treatment of the loop distribution is based on\nthe assumption that all intercommutations occurs shortly after a horizon-crossing loop\nis chopped up. General scaling arguments suggest that the interaction rate diminishes\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\frapidly. Without interactions, the center of mass velocity suffers cosmic drag.3\nAssume that the initial center of mass velocity is vci = 0.1c at time ti when the loop\nis born.

An estimate for the local enhancement\nof loops is\nF = fslow fover\n(4.5)\ni.e. roughly the overdensity of the Galaxy itself.\nThe above estimate for F is a lower bound because the actual dynamical evolution\nof the loops is not dissipationless. At equipartition, a loop begins to accrete matter.\nA novel aspect of the structure formation in this scenario is that suitably small loops\nwill radiate and disappear but leave behind bound sub-galactic clumps of matter. Such\nobjects are of considerable interest in their own right but here we focus on the mass\ndensity of the smallest surviving loops of mass Mg in today's Galaxy. Such a loop\naccretes a mass \u223c (1 + zeq )Mg with zeq \u223c 3570 (in the approximation of a flat, matterdominated cosmology). This bound, composite object lives in the larger-scale growing\ngalactic potential and it will be dragged by dynamical friction towards the center. As\nan example, consider the case for G\u03bc = 2 \u00d7 10\u221210 , where Mg \u223c 1.7 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 and clump\nmass \u223c 6.4 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 . Let the clump move on a circular orbit in an isothermal halo with\nrotation velocity 220 km s\u22121 . The radial drift takes it from \u223c 36 kpc to 20 kpc over a\nHubble time [34]. The net motion with respect to the halo increases the density of such\nloops within 20 kpc by at least an additional factor \u223c 1.8. The net radial drift for a loop\n\u221a\nof length l scales \u221d (\u03bcl)1/2 and the drift for the smallest surviving loop scales \u221d \u03bc \u0393R .\nThese dissipational effects mean that loops, like baryons, may be over-concentrated with\n\u221210\nrespect to the dark matter. The effect on the smallest loops is important if G\u03bc >\n\u223c 10 .\nThe distribution of loop size will also be tilted within the Galaxy compared to dN/dV dl\non account of the dissipative processes.\nWe make a conservative estimate for F in our numerical calculations by ignoring\nthese dissipative enhancements to the loop density.\n\n5. Practical Lensing\nThere are a number of characteristic timescales relevant to experimental detection of\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\flensing. For the lensing itself, the characteristic duration of the event is\nR\u03b8E\nc\nR8\u03c0G\u03bc\n=\nc\n\n\u03b4tlens =\n\n3\n\n= 6.3 \u00d7 10 sec\n\n\u0012\n\nR\n100kpc\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\nG\u03bc\n2 \u00d7 10\u221210\n\n\u0013\n\n(5.1)\n\nThe characteristic time for the (smallest) loop to oscillate is\ntosc\n\nlg\n\u223c \u223c 135yrs\nc\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0393R G\u03bc\n10\u22128\n\n\u0013\n\n(5.2)\n\nand this governs the repetition timescale.\nThe observational timescales are \u03b4t1 , the time for an individual observation, \u2206T , the\nduration of the experiment, and \u03b4\u2206T = \u2206T /Nrep , the characteristic interval between\nobservations where Nrep is the number of times a star is visited over the course of the\nexperiment.\nTo make this concrete, we will consider the Gaia mission which will monitor N\u2217 = 109\nstars for \u2206T = 5 yrs with fluxes exceeding a mission-defined broad band magnitude\nG = 20. On average, the Broad-band photometer will observe each star Nrep = 80 times\nbut the interval between observations is not fixed; it will vary from \u223c 30 minutes to\n\u2206T /Nrep . An individual observation is \u03b4t1 \u223c 3.3 seconds. Let \u03b4\u2206T \u223c \u2206Tobs /Nrep be the\ncharacteristic interval between repeat observations. The mission observes \u223c 103 stars at\na time (note N\u2217 Nrep \u03b4t1 >> \u2206T ); all astrometric and photometric results for individual\nstars are derived by detailed analysis of the joint observations.\nThe accuracy of the photometry depends upon the brightness of the source. The\nlimiting magnitude G = 20 corresponds to objects with a range of usual visual magnitudes V \u223c 20 \u2212 25. Individual observations for sources with V = 20, 21, 22 and 23, for\nexample, have relative flux accuracies 2.5%, 5%, 10% and 26% respectively and are more\nthan adequate to see a factor of 2 change due to microlensing at the limiting magnitude.\nA star like the Sun (type G2V) will be visible to a limiting magnitude V = 20.2 or\na distance approximately 12 kpc. To make estimates of the number of lensing events\nthat Gaia is capable of observing we need to account for the distribution of stars and\nthe \"efficiencies\" with which detections can be made. We assume here that the stars\nobserved by Gaia are uniformly distributed in space and concentrate on the detection\nefficiency\nfdet = fmag fsize ftime\n\n(5.3)\n\nwhere fmag is the flux limit, fsize is the source size cutoff (so that the angular size\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n\f\u0398 < \u0398E ), and ftime accounts for sampling\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u03b4tlens if\n\u03b4\u2206T\nftime =\n\uf8f4 1 if\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0\n\nin time. We adopt a crude model\nif \u03b4tlens < \u03b4t1\n\u03b4t1 < \u03b4tlens < \u03b4\u2206T\n\u03b4\u2206T < \u03b4tlens < \u2206T\n\n(5.4)\n\nif \u2206T < \u03b4tlens\n\nAny lensing event which is shorter than the length of a single observation or longer\nthan the length of the entire experiment cannot be detected; all remaining events longer\nthan the average interval between observations will be seen but only a fraction of events\nshorter than it will be. The assumption is that the observational intervals are uniformly\nspread between the shortest and longest periods. A more accurate description of the\nschedule of observations will readily improve the model for ftime . To find the detectable\nlensing rate, we recalculate RL with fdet to give RLGaia . The expected number of events\nis N Gaia = RLGaia N\u2217 \u2206T .\nThe expected number of lensings detectable by Gaia are shown in Figure 4 by\nred/blue contours. These include all efficiency factors (magnitude, size and time) with\neach contour labeled by the log of the number of detectable lensings. Note that the expected number of detectable events decreases as G\u03bc \u2192 0 at fixed \u0393R (for G\u03bc < 10\u22128 ), a\nconsequence of decreased detection efficiency for short duration events (ftime \u2192 0). The\nsharp cutoff as G\u03bc \u223c 10\u221213 is where the angular size of the star becomes comparable to\nthe Einstein angle (fsize \u2192 0). The number of events depends on the path length (set\nby the flux limit fmag ) and the intrinsic loop density.\nTo illustrate the important effect of size and time cutoffs, we also display the expected\nnumber of lensing events if detections were limited only by flux considerations (green\ndashed contours). Note that the expected numbers increase as G\u03bc \u2192 0. These curves\ngive some guidance on how alternative experiments might fare by adjusting Nrep , N\u2217 and\n\u2206T .\nAn experiment with duration \u2206T < tosc will see at most one lensing event. Conversely, if \u2206T > tosc the experiment has the capability of seeing multiple lensing events\nfrom the same source. If G\u03bc < 7 \u00d7 10\u221212 multiple lensing may be observed by Gaia. In\nany case, a potential lens can be re-observed by other means even after the mission has\nended.\nThe figure has been constructed for a \"typical\" star within the Galaxy. The objects included in Gaia's catalog will depend on many factors \u2013 stellar type, interstellar\nobscuration, crowding, etc. \u2013 and these will alter the effective cutoffs and the number\nof events. For example, bright halo giants will be visible within approximately 41 kpc\n(type G0III; radius \u223c 3.3R\u2299 ). Compared to the more numerous G2V class, the lensing\nrate per star should be \u223c 14 times larger on account of longer pathlengths and longer\nlensing durations. On the other hand, the cutoff at small G\u03bc will be comparable to G2V\nbecause the angular sizes are comparable at the limiting distance.\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\fLog10 Expected Number Lens Events Gaia HSolarL\n2\n\n5\n\n-1\n\n-2\n3\n\n6\n\n1\n\nLog GR\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n7\n\n2\n\n4\n\n-2\n-18\n\n-16\n\n-14\n\n-12\n\n-10\n\n-8\n\n-6\n\nLogH\u039cL\n\nFigure 4: Log of the number of microlensing events detectable by a Gaia-like mission looking\nat 109 sources over 5 years. In this plot all sources are assumed to be solar mass stars (G2V)\nwithin 12 kpc. The string loop density is based on the fiducial powerlaw model evolved in a\n\u039b-CDM cosmology. The local string overdensity is F = fslow fover as described in the text. The\nred/blue lines include magnitude, time and angular efficiency factors; the dashed green lines\ninclude only the flux cutoff.\n2\nAt the flux limit, a star's angular size \u221d 1/Tef\nf where Tef f is the star's effective\ntemperature. Hotter stars can be seen further and have smaller angular size at the\nlimiting distance. Consequently, the condition that the Einstein angle exceeds the stellar\nangular size implies a minimum tension detectable by an optical microlensing experiment\n2\n\u221d 1/Tef\nf . The inclusion of stars hotter than the sun may provide sensitivity to tensions\nbeyond the cutoff indicated in the figure. Of course, the number of such stars is an\nimportant consideration: hot white dwarfs, for example, would probe very low tensions\nbut are not visible to large distances. Likewise, the duration of the lensing event should\nexceed the timescale of a single observation to measure the doubling in image brightness.\nAt the flux limit, the minimum tension \u221d 1/L1/2 where L is the stellar luminosity. The\ninclusion of stars more luminous than the sun may provide sensitivity beyond the cutoff.\nAn accurate assessment will depend on the make up of Gaia's catalog, a subject to which\nwe hope to return.\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\n\fThe Broad-band photometer measures 5 colors during an observation but this information is insufficient to allow identification and classification of stellar types throughout\nthe HR diagram; it will be supplemented by photometry in 14 other bands from the\nMedium-band photometer, a distinct instrument on board. The mission expects to observe \u223c 18 \u00d7 106 variable stars [22] and the extensive color coverage is essential to\nfacilitate identification and classification of known variables types (pulsating stars, eruptive variables, etc.). This circumstance will prove a great benefit if string microlensing\nis sought. String microlensing is almost achromatic (the Kaiser Stebbins effect gives\nrelative frequency shifts order \u223c G\u03bc\u03b3(v/c); since G\u03bc is small the shift is small for mildly\nrelativistic loop motion) whereas variable stars typically show color changes. The key\npoint is that a cosmic string microlensing event should be an achromatic change in brightness by a factor of 2. The situation is qualitatively similar to that faced by ground-based\nmicrolensing experiments which anticipate an achromatic change in an a priori known\nform for the time-dependent amplification factor.\nFinally, we note that the Broad and Medium-band photometers have their own time\nsampling characteristics. Depending upon the detailed scheduling of scans, there may\nbe an improved detection efficiency compared to our simple estimate.\n\n6. Remarks\nWhen string tension is low the density in loops exceeds that in long strings because\nthe timescale for gravitational damping becomes long. The total string energy density\ntoday is dominated by the loops originally formed during the radiation era. This preponderance of loops over long strings motivates consideration of the cosmology of loops.\nThe evolution of these objects turns out to be completely distinct from that of the long\n\u22126\nstrings originally studied with G\u03bc >\n\u223c 10 .\nThe loops damp by cosmic drag and are utterly inconsequential in terms of structure\nformation on scales much larger than the galaxy. Instead, they fall into the potential\nwells created by cold dark matter and baryons after equipartition. The Galactic halo\nnumber density of loops is enhanced over the universe's average value by at least the\nGalaxy's overdensity \u223c 105 . Dissipational effects which depend upon the size of G\u03bc may\nfurther increase the overdensity.\nThe loops within the Galaxy can be observed by microlensing using stars as sources.\nTo the extent that stars are point-like and bright low tension strings can be observed.\nSimple estimates of a microlensing survey based on the capabilities of the Gaia mission\nsuggest that many such events may be detected. If loops are moving at halo velocities\nthe lensing of a given source should repeat \u223c 103 times.\nDetailed observations of such a lensing source will have much to tell us about string\ntension and the number density of loops.\nWe recognize many gaps in this general story\n\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n\f\u2022 What processes are responsible for producing the F = 1 (average, unclustered)\ndistribution of loop sizes? When does the rate of interactions between loops and/or\nlong strings become negligible? When does cosmic drag predominate over velocities\ninduced by intercommutation?\n\u2022 How do loop-loop interactions develop as the galaxy grows? Does intercommutation end up ejecting loops from the galaxy? How does the distribution function of\nloop sizes change on account of the intercommutations in the dense environment?\nHow small are the smallest loops? Is the gravitational lifetime significantly altered? Can one use this to measure or learn about p? The loop size distribution is\npotentially measurable via microlensing and locally generated gravitational waves.\n\u2022 What are the astrophysical constraints on massive loops moving around galaxy?\nHow are loops distributed within the Galaxy?\n\u2022 What string and loop parameters can we deduce by observing repetitive lensing?\nDoes small scale structure on the loops increase the microlensing repetition rate?\n\u2022 Incorporate lensing over radii ranging from larger than the loop size to smaller. Is\nthe Kaiser-Stebbins effect detectable from a known lens?\n\u2022 An accurate calculation of Gaia's capabilities for string microlensing requires in\ndepth analysis of the time-based observing strategy for both the broad and medium\nband photometers.\n\u2022 Can one design an experiment tailored to doing a better job for detecting microlensing than a mission like Gaia? It is worth noting that the Gaia sample includes photometry much more accurate than what is needed to detect microlensing. Could\none generate a larger catalog with more poorly determined flux measurements still\nadequate to detect string microlensing? Would there be enough information to\nrule out variable stars?\n\u2022 How can one optimize the choice of \u2206T , Nrep and \u03b4t1 to investigate particular\nranges of G\u03bc?\nDetecting cosmic superstrings and measuring their tension can reveal fundamental\ninformation about superstring theory and elucidate the large-scale contents as well as\nthe remote evolutionary history of our own universe. An observable, nearby source of\nstrings to study promises to advance, qualitatively and quantitatively, these goals.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Joe Polchinski, Hassan Firouzjahi, Louis Leblond, Irit Maor, Gary Shiu, Ira\nWasserman, Mark Wyman, Ben Shlaer, Ken Olum, Xavier Siemens, Konrad Kuijken,\n\n\u2013 19 \u2013\n\n\fTanmay Vachaspati for useful discussions.

Appendix\nWe start with a form generally consistent with the assumption of a scaling network\ndN(l, t)\n= t\u22125 f (x)\ndldtdV\n\nwith x = l/t\n\n(A.1)\n\nwhere l and V are measured in physical (not comoving) lengths. We make the assumption\nthat the chopping of long strings all the way down to the smallest loops occurs in a time\nshort compared to the expansion timescale. Of course, on the Hubble scale this won't\nbe a very good approximation but it should get better at smaller scales and thats what\nis of most interest here. Loop length l is the time-averaged physical length associated\nwith the loop when the loop itself is small compared to the scale of the horizon. A\ncosmological simulation is required to establish the form for f which describes loops\nwith sizes comparable to the scale of the horizon.\nMotivated by the numerical simulation in Ref.[23, 28], we take the loop production\nto be given by a power law distribution with upper and lower cutoffs\nf (x) = Ax\u2212\u03b2\n\nfor \u03b1L < x < \u03b1U\n\n(A.2)\n\nand zero otherwise. In addition to the upper limit, we impose a lower limit on the\nthe range of loops. This is a manifestation of the cutting up process and not due to\ngravitational wave emission. In this approximate description, dynamical processes chop\nup strings to give the loop spectrum instantly. Gravitational radiation acts once the\nspectrum has been created.\nThe scaling network is characterized by some inter-string distance d(t) = \u03b3s t, defined\nso that the density in long strings is \u03c1\u221e = \u03bc/d2 .

We write our model\nwith two generalizations of the canonical description.\n\u2022 \u0393R : We introduce a distinct damping rate for loops, \u0393R . It is possible that the\naverage loop damping rate differs substantially from \u0393 because small loops, large\nloops and horizon-crossing strings intercommutate.\n\u2022 \u03c4 : Lifetime in the network might be a nonlinear function of l. This could arise\nbecause of the nontrivial interaction of intercommutation and damping.\nIf lifetime is linear in length then loops of length l born at time t\u2032 and observed at\ntime t must have\nl > \u0393R G\u03bc(t \u2212 t\u2032 )\n\nfor t > t\u2032\n\n(A.7)\n\nOur model assumes that loops are unaffected by gravitational wave damping until they\nreach the end of their life at which point they are abruptly removed from the population.\nThe loop density at time t2 due to loops produced during the interval I = (t0 , t1 ) is\nfound by integrating the production rate density production of loops:\ndN\n1\n(t2 ; I) =\ndV dl\nV (t2 )\n\nZ\n\nt1\n\nt0\n\ndt\u2032\n\ndN\nV (t\u2032 )\u03b8(t2 \u2212 t\u2032 < \u03c4 (l))\ndV dldt\u2032\n\n(A.8)\n\nHere V (t) is physical volume.

Now the density at t2 depends upon how\nV varies beyond I. If n is constant over the entire interval t0 to t2 then G = 1. If loops\nare born in the radiation-dominated epoch (n = n1 = 1/2), which extends from t \u223c 0 to\nteq \u2248 4.7 \u00d7 104 yrs, and are observed in the matter-dominated and/or lambda-dominated\n1\nepochs we have a non-trivial G.

Specifically, we take n = 1/2,\nt0 = 0, t1 = teq followed by n = 2/3, t0 = teq , t1 = t2 = ttoday . For lack of more precise\nnumbers we take \u03b1L = 10\u22124 , \u03b1U = 0.3, \u0393R G\u03bc = \u03b1G = 10\u22128 (i.e. lifetime linear in l:\n\u03c4 (l) = l/\u03b1G ), \u03b2 = 1.6, \u03a5 = 43.6 during both epochs. These choices imply N1 = 40\nand N2 = 91. The background cosmological model has te = 4.7 \u00d7 104 yrs and the\ncurrent epoch ttoday = 1.35 \u00d7 1010 yrs. The estimate of the number density has a cutoff\nat l \u2243 10\u22128 from gravitational damping; the very slight kink at loop size l \u2243 10\u22126 is\nroughly equal to \u03b1U teq i.e. of order the horizon at equipartition.\nTwo straight lines are included in the figure and are evidently close approximations\nto the slope of dN/dV dl over an intermediate regime. The slope is determined by\nthe expansion rate. Assume a pure powerlaw expansion with t0 = 0 and t1 = ttoday ,\n\u03b1L << \u03b1U and \u03b6 > 0 (e.g. \u03b2 = 1.6 and 1/2 \u2264 n \u2264 2/3 gives 0.9 \u2265 \u03b6 \u2265 0.4).\nDefine the lengths lmin = \u03b1L t, lmax = \u03b1U t and lg = \u03b1G t.

The gravitational\nwave damping destroys the small scale loops while the expanding horizon continuously\ngives rise to larger scale loops. The expansion decreases the number density. The intermediate form, supplemented by the appropriate G, will generally be sufficient to describe\nthe loop distribution for loops that cannot have decayed (l > lg,2 where lg,2 = lg (t2 )) and\nsmaller than the largest loop formed (l < lmax,1 where lmax,1 = \u03b1U t1 ), presuming the\nordering lg,2 < l < lmax,1 . Of course, the full expression is needed to describe the exact\nform near small and large l and to deal with situations in which the intermediate regime\ndoes not have enough time to form.\nWe are primarily interested in understanding whether various integrals are dominated by the small or large scale part of the distribution. Consider the density distribution of lQ ; Q = 0 gives number density, Q = 1 gives length (needed for energy density\nand lensing estimates), and so forth.
