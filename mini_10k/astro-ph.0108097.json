The absence of a GunnPeterson trough (Shklovsky 1964, Scheuer 1965, Gunn &\nPeterson 1965) in the spectrum of the z = 5.8 quasar\nSDSSp J104433.4\u2013012502.2 (SDSS 1044\u20130125 for brevity,\nFan et al. 2000; see Goodrich et al. 2001 for an updated\nredshift based on the CIV line in the near-infrared) indicates that the intergalactic medium (IGM) is already\nhighly ionized at z \u223c 5.5, presumably by the UV ionizing\nphotons from quasars and star-forming galaxies at high\nredshift. In Paper I, we used the low resolution discovery\nspectra of the three new quasars at z > 5.8, taken with\nthe ARC 3.5m telescope at Apache Point Observatory, to\nshow that Ly\u03b1 absorption increases significantly from a\nredshift of 5.5 to a redshift of 6.0. In particular, the spectrum of the z = 6.28 quasar SDSSpJ 103027.10+052455.0\nshows that in a \u223c 300\u00c5 region of the Ly\u03b1 forest immediately blueward of the Ly\u03b1 emission line, the flux level is\nconsistent with zero, indicating a flux decrement of & 50,\nand suggesting a possible detection of the complete GunnPeterson trough. To more accurately quantify this effect,\nand to constrain the properties of the IGM, we have obtained higher resolution spectra of the three new z > 5.8\nquasars using the Echelle Spectrograph and Imager (ESI;\nEpps & Miller 1998) on the Keck II telescope.\nIn section 2 we describe the observations and present\nthe spectra of all four z & 5.8 quasars in the sample of\nFan et al. (2001a). We measure the emission line redshifts\nof the three new quasars using these spectra. In section\n3, we discuss the properties of the Ly\u03b1 forest in the four\nspectra from the point of view of the overall opacity of the\nIGM as a function of redshift. In section 4 we discuss the\ncosmological implications of the results.\n2. spectroscopic observations\n\nSDSSp J083643.85+005453.3 (z = 5.82), SDSSp\nJ130608.26+035626.3 (z\n=\n5.99) and SDSSp\nJ103027.10+052455.0 (z = 6.28, referred to as SDSS\n0836+0054, SDSS 1306+0356 and SDSS 1030+0524\nthroughout this paper for brevity) were selected as idropout objects from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS,\nYork et al. 2000) multicolor imaging data. They were further separated from cool dwarfs using follow-up J-band\nphotometry, and discovery spectra were obtained using\nthe Double Imaging Spectrograph (DIS), a low-resolution\nspectrograph (R \u223c 500) on the ARC 3.5m telescope at the\nApache Point Observatory (Paper I).\nIn March and May, 2001, we obtained moderate resolution spectra of these three high redshift quasars, using ESI\non the Keck II telescope. The spectra were taken in the\nechellette mode of ESI. In this mode, the spectral range\nfrom 4000 to 10000 \u00c5 is covered in ten spectral orders with\na constant dispersion of 11.4 km s\u22121 pixel\u22121 . With a plate\nscale ranging from 0.142\u2032\u2032 to 0.128\u2032\u2032 per pixel in the three\nreddest orders, the 1\u2032\u2032 slit has a footprint of 81\u201390 km s\u22121\nand the \u223c 0.7\u2032\u2032 typical seeing has a footprint of 57\u201363 km\ns\u22121 . Using the sky lines in the spectrum, we estimate that\nthe Full Width at Half Maximum of the instrument profile\n\nis \u223c 1.8\u00c5 at \u223c 8500\u00c5, indicating a spectral resolution of\n66 km s\u22121 , or R \u223c 4700, almost 10 times higher than that\nof the discovery spectra. Wavelength calibration is based\non observations of Hg-Ne-Xe lamps and Cu-Ar lamps. The\nESI has active flexure control that minimizes any drift in\nthe wavelength calibration or fringing pattern. This is especially important for accurate sky subtraction \u2013 a crucial\nstep in detecting the faint flux in the quasar Ly\u03b1 forest region in the presence of strong sky emission lines. The spectrophotometric standard G191-B2B (Massey 1988, Massey\n& Gronwall 1990) was observed for flux calibration. The\nstandard star, observed at similar airmass as the quasars,\nwas also used for tracing the spectra in the spectral region where little flux is detected from the quasar due to\nstrong Ly\u03b1 absorption. All the observations were made at\nthe parallactic angle. Data reduction made use of standard IRAF routines along with a suite of custom analysis\nroutines that handle the large curvature, highly non-linear\nphotometric response, and slight tilt of the sky lines in the\nESI instrument. The dates and durations of the exposures\nare given in Table 1.\nThe three spectra are displayed in Figure 1, along with\nthe spectrum of SDSS 1044\u20130125, which was observed an\nyear earlier with the same instrument setting (Fig. 2 of\nFan et al. 2000). The spectra are binned to 4\u00c5 pixel\u22121 to\nimprove the signal-to-noise ratio, and the flux levels are\nadjusted to match the z band photometry presented in\nPaper I. Each pixel is weighted by the inverse square of\nthe estimated noise on that pixel when the high resolution spectrum is binned to low resolution. It is clear from\na visual inspection of the four spectra that the flux level\nblueward of Ly\u03b1 decreases with increasing redshift, and is\nconsistent with zero flux in SDSS 1030+0524.\nUsing these spectra, we first determine accurate redshifts from the emission lines. As discussed in Fan et al.\n(2000) and in Paper I, redshift determination of z > 5.5\nquasars using optical spectra is difficult, due to the weakness of the accessible metal emission lines and the effect\nof Ly\u03b1 forest absorption on the Ly\u03b1 emission line. The\npresence of associated metal absorption lines would also\nbias the result (Goodrich et al. 2001). The strong CIV\nemission line, now at \u03bb > 10000\u00c5, would provide a more\nreliable redshift measurement, but it lies beyond our spectral coverage for all our objects.\nSDSS 1044\u20130125. As mentioned above, the displayed\nspectrum is from Fan et al. (2000). Djorgovski et al. (2001)\npresent a higher signal-to-noise spectrum of SDSS 1044\u2013\n0125, which shows the increasing optical depth of the Ly\nalpha forest with redshift particularly well.\nSDSS 0836+0054. A strong OI+SiII\u03bb1302 emission\nline is detected at \u03bb = 8873 \u00b1 1\u00c5, with a rest-frame equivalent width (EW) of 4.2\u00b10.1\u00c5. The Ly\u03b1+NV emission\nline is very broad, with the peak wavelength of the Ly\u03b1\ncomponent at \u223c 8230\u00c5, and EW = 70 \u00b1 3\u00c5. We adopt a\nredshift of 5.82, using the central wavelength of OI line,\nand a redshift error of 0.02, considering the uncertainty using a single line for redshift. The peak of the Ly\u03b1 emission\nline is consistent with this redshift. The EW of OI+SiII is\ncomparable to that of the average of z \u223c 4 quasars (3.2\u00c5,\nSchneider, Schmidt & Gunn 1991).\nSDSS 1306+0356. The strong Ly\u03b1+NV emission line\nshows a separate NV\u03bb1240 component. We determine the\n\n\f3\n\nFig. 1.- Optical spectra of z & 5.8 quasars observed with Keck/ESI, in the observed frame. The spectra have been smoothed to 4\u00c5\npixel\u22121 , and have been normalized to the observed z band flux. The spectrum of SDSS1044\u20130125 has been taken from Fan et al. (2000). In\neach spectrum, the expected wavelengths of prominent emission lines, as well as the Lyman limit, are indicated by the dashed lines.\n\n\f4\ncentral wavelengths and EWs of Ly\u03b1 and NV by fitting\ntwo Gaussian profiles to the wavelength range redward of\nthe peak of Ly\u03b1 emission, i.e., the region not affected by\nthe Ly\u03b1 forest absorption. The wavelength ratio of the\ntwo components is fixed in the fitting procedure. We find\nzem = 5.99, EW(Ly\u03b1) = 38.1 \u00b1 14.9\u00c5, and EW(NV) =\n17.9 \u00b1 6.3 \u00c5. No obvious OI+SiII emission line is detected;\nany emission line there is probably affected by the CIV\nabsorption feature at the same wavelength (see below). A\npossible SiIV\u03bb1402 feature is detected at \u223c 9800\u00c5, but it\nis difficult to fit its profile due to the weakness of the line\nand possible absorption lines nearby. We therefore adopt\na redshift of 5.99 \u00b1 0.02 for SDSS 1306+0356.\nIn the spectrum of SDSS 1306+0356, we notice a strong\nabsorption feature at \u223c 7130\u00c5, where over \u223c 80\u00c5, there\nis no detectable flux. The rest-frame equivalent width is\n\u223c 15\u00c5, typical for a damped Ly\u03b1 system, at a redshift of\nzabs = 4.86. A strong absorption feature is detected at\n\u03bb = 9080\u00c5, corresponding to CIV absorption at the same\nredshift. This feature is double peaked in absorption, consistent with the \u03bb\u03bb1548, 1551 components of the CIV doublet, although the signal-to-noise ratio is low at that wavelength. This system, if confirmed by high signal-to-noise\nratio spectroscopy, is the highest-redshift damped Ly\u03b1 system known (the previous record holder was at z = 4.47;\nP\u00e9roux et al. 2001; Dessauges-Zavadsky et al. 2001). The\ntwo other doublet absorption features at \u223c 9900\u00c5 and\n\u223c 8960\u00c5, are identified as MgII absorptions at z = 2.53\nand 2.20, respectively. Note that other spectra in this paper also show various absorption features redward of Ly\u03b1\nemission. The detailed identifications of these metal lines\nare beyond the scope of this paper.\nSDSS 1030+0524. In Paper I, we presented the\nKeck/NIRSPEC J-band spectrum of this object, in which\na strong CIV feature (EW = 31.5 \u00b1 8.6\u00c5) is detected, at\nz = 6.28 \u00b1 0.02. The optical spectrum shows a separate\nNV emission line, and possible detection of OI+SiII and\nSiIV lines at the same redshift. We measure EW(Ly\u03b1)\n= 40.9 \u00b1 7.4\u00c5, and EW(NV) = 16.9 \u00b1 4.0 \u00c5, by fitting\nGaussian profiles to the blended Ly\u03b1+NV emission line.\nPaper I discusses the implication of the detection of\nmetal emission lines, in particular, that of NV emission,\nto the metallicity of the quasar environment. Assuming a\npower law continuum of f\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u22120.5 , the flux ratio NV/CIV\nis 0.74 \u00b1 0.27, consistent with a super-solar metallicity\nZ & 3Z\u2299 , according to the calculations of Hamann & Ferland (1993). Note, however, these calculations assume a\nsingle-zone photo-ionization model, and might be affected\nby the uncertainties in heavy element ratios, as well as\npossible enhancement of NV flux by resonant scattering\nfrom the red wing of the Ly\u03b1 emission line (Krolik & Voit\n1998).\n3. neutral hydrogen absorption\n\nIn Paper I, we calculated the average absorption in the\nLy\u03b1 forest region based on the ARC 3.5m discovery spectra. Here we carry out these calculations with the Keck\nspectra. The results are summarized in Table 2. The table includes the measurement of the DA and DB parameters following Oke & Korycansky (1982), the average flux\ndecrement in the Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 forest regions, respectively,\nas well as the transmitted flux ratio [T (zabs )] defined in\n\nPaper I, measured in the highest redshift window in each\nquasar that is not affected by the Ly\u03b1 emission line and\nthe proximity effect. The definitions of these quantities are\ngiven in Paper I. The transmitted flux ratio is measured\nin the redshift range zem \u2212 0.4 < zabs < zem \u2212 0.2 for\nall objects except SDSS 1030+0524, for which the range is\n5.95 < zabs < 6.16. Additional measurements of this quantity along the line of sight to each quasar at lower redshift\nare illustrated in Figure 2. All the measurements here and\nbelow assume an intrinsic quasar continuum f\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u22120.5\n(f\u03bb \u221d \u03bb\u22121.5 ), with the continuum normalized at rest frame\nwavelength of 1270 \u00b1 10\u00c5, a region free of major emission\nlines. The unknown continuum shape is a source of systematic error. However, for a wavelength window close to\nthe Ly\u03b1 emission, and in the regime in which T (zabs ) \u226a 1,\nthis error is much smaller than the cosmic variance of T\n(see below). As in Paper I, the error bars on the DA and\nDB measurements reflect the uncertainties of the continuum shape in the Ly\u03b1 forest region, while the error bars\non T (zabs ) include only the photon noise. In calculating\nthe average flux and the photon noise, the signal in each\npixel is weighted by the inverse square of the estimated\nnoise level in that pixel. The values in Table 2 are consistent with the measurements in Paper I, albeit with errors\nlower by a factor of \u223c 5.\nIn Table 2, we also include the measurement of the redshift of the Lyman Limit System (zLLS ), following the\nmethod described in Fan et al. (2000, \u00a74.1). Note, however, at z \u223c 6, the flux level at the rest-frame 912\u00c5 is\nso low due to the presence of numerous Ly\u03b1 forest lines\nfrom lower redshift, that this measurement is rather uncertain. The quasar spectra are consistent with no flux\nalmost immediately blueward of rest-frame 912\u00c5.\nFigure 2 presents the evolution of the transmitted flux\nratio T and effective optical depth \u03c4ef f (\u2261 \u2212 ln(T )) as a\nfunction of redshift zabs . The average absorption evolves\nstrongly with redshift. At zabs \u223c 3.5, T \u223c 0.4 (e.g. Rauch\net al. 1997). It decreases to T \u223c 0.25 at z \u223c 4.5 (Songaila\net al. 1999). At z \u223c 5.0, hT i \u223c 0.12 from Figure 2, and\nat z \u223c 5.5, hT i \u223c 0.07. The scatter of T at the same redshift is larger than implied by photon noise or uncertainty\nof the continuum shape, suggesting that the error in T is\ndominated by cosmic variance. Zuo (1993) calculated the\nscatter of the transmitted flux given the number density\nand column density distribution of Ly\u03b1 clouds. Using Eq.\n(9) in that paper, we find that at z \u223c 5.5, for T \u223c 0.10,\n\u03c3(T ) \u223c 0.03, comparable to the scatter seen in Figure 2.\nFor T \u226a 1, \u03c3(T ) is comparable to T itself, and decreases\nrapidly toward higher redshift.\nThe only measurements of T at z > 5.7 come from the\nhighest redshift object SDSS 1030+0524. It shows that\nT (zabs = 5.75) = 0.03. The most dramatic change in T ,\nhowever, comes from the measurement at z \u223c 6; over the\nredshift range 5.95 < zabs < 6.16, the average transmitted flux T = 0.0038 \u00b1 0.0026. This 1.5 \u03c3 \"detection\" is in\nfact consistent with zero in our estimation; indeed, slight\nchanges in the way we did our sky subtraction caused the\nvalue to change by of order 1 \u03c3. Thus there is no detectable\nflux over the wavelength range of 8450 < \u03bb < 8710\u00c5, corresponding to a flux decrement of > 150 from the continuum level, or equivalently, to a lower limit (1-\u03c3) on the\nGunn-Peterson optical depth due to neutral hydrogen in\n\n\f5\n\nFig. 2.- Evolution of transmitted flux ratio and effective Gunn-Peterson optical depth as functions of redshift. The solid line is the expected\nevolution if the number density of Ly\u03b1 clouds increases as N (z) \u221d (1 + z)2.5 . No flux is detected in the spectrum of SDSS 1030+0524 at\nzabs \u223c 6, indicating \u03c4ef f > 5.0. The non-detection of flux in the Ly\u03b2 trough gives a substantially stronger 1\u03c3 upper limit of \u03c4ef f > 20.\n\n\f6\nthe IGM of \u03c4GP > 5.0. At \u03bb > 8750\u00c5, the flux is detectable again, presumably due to the effect of the ionizing photons from the luminous quasar itself (\u00a74). This\nresult confirms the measurement based on the discovery\nspectrum (Paper I), in which we found T = 0.003 \u00b1 0.020.\nThis is the first detection of a complete Gunn-Peterson\ntrough, in the sense that no flux is detected over a large\nwavelength range in the Ly\u03b1 forest region, indicating that\nthe effective Gunn-Peterson optical depth caused by neutral hydrogen in the IGM, \u03c4ef f , is much larger than one.\nFigure 3 shows the sky-subtracted two-dimensional\nspectrogram from the ninth order of the ESI data; note\nthe complete absence of detected flux blueward of the Ly\u03b1\nemission line. Figure 3 also shows the one-dimensional\nspectrum and the corresponding estimated error per pixel\n(shaded) of SDSS 1030+0524 over the redshift range\n5.75 < z < 6.25 for both Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2. As evident from\nthe figure, the average flux level is consistent with zero for\n5.95 < z < 6.16 at both lines (8450 \u2013 8710 \u00c5 for Ly\u03b1, and\n7130 \u2013 7350 \u00c5 for Ly\u03b2).\nThe effective continuum at Ly\u03b2 is affected by the Ly\u03b1\nforest. The effective Ly\u03b1 redshift at 7240 \u00c5, the center\nof the Ly\u03b2 trough, is z \u2248 5. Figure 2 shows that at\nthat redshift, the transmission of the Ly\u03b1 forest is roughly\n12%, albeit with large scatter (see also Songaila et al.\n1999). Taking this into account, and again extrapolating the quasar continuum from redward of Ly\u03b1 emission\nassuming f\u03bb \u221d \u03bb\u22121.5 gives a measured transmitted flux\nratio in the Ly\u03b2 trough of \u22120.002 \u00b1 0.020, a clear nondetection. The error does not include the uncertainty in\nthe transmission of Ly\u03b1 at z = 5, which we estimate to\nbe approximately 20% in \u03c4ef f based on the scatter seen in\nFig. 2.\nThe ratio of oscillator strengths of the Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2\nlines is 5.27 (Verner, Verner, & Ferland 1996). Thus we\ncan convert the transmitted flux ratio in the Ly\u03b2 forest\nregion to an equivalent 1\u03c3 lower limit to the optical depth\nin the Ly\u03b1 forest region of \u03c4ef f > 20 (albeit with an uncertainty due to the limits of our model for the intrinsic\nspectrum). This limit is, in fact, considerably stronger\nthan the limit obtained directly from the Ly\u03b1 forest itself.\nAt \u03bb < 6980\u00c5, there appears to be another break (Figure 1); this is the start of the corresponding Ly\u03b3 GunnPeterson trough. We have not attempted to obtain a quantitative optical depth for this line, due to the extreme overlapping absorption from both the Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 forests.\nOur ability to constrain the upper limit of the flux in the\nLy\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 forest regions, and the corresponding lower\nlimit to the Gunn-Peterson optical depth, depends on the\nreliability of sky subtraction. In this case, the expression\n\"black as night\" has special significance because invariably, upper limits to brightness come down to the accuracy with which one can subtract the sky. Unfortunately,\nthe night sky is not very black, especially in the near IR\nregion, where the sky emission is concentrated in a series\nof very bright OH lines that nearly blanket the spectrum.\nAt the ESI resolution, the peak of the strongest sky lines\nat 8000 \u2013 9000\u00c5 can be a factor of > 50 stronger than\nthat of the darker region between lines. The high spectral\nresolution of ESI enables us to resolve the much darker\nregions between strong sky lines and limits the number\nof pixels affected by the sky lines. The pixels affected by\n\nstrong sky lines are assigned much smaller weights when\nwe calculate the average flux and effective optical depth.\nIt is our considered opinion that in this instance, the data\nreduction posed no unusual difficulties and that the faint\nto nonexistent flux levels seen blueward of Ly\u03b1 are reliable. These problems are less severe in the spectral region\nof the Ly\u03b2 trough, and as we've seen, the two troughs give\nconsistent limits on the mean optical depth.\n4. discussion\n\nThe Gunn-Peterson (1965) optical depth in a uniformly\ndistributed IGM is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u00133/2 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u03a9b h 2\n1+z\nnHI\n5 \u22121 \u22121/2\n\u03c4GP (z) = 1.8\u00d710 h \u03a9M\n.\n0.02\n7\nnH\n(1)\nOnly a small fraction of neutral hydrogen component in\nthe IGM is needed to have \u03c4GP \u226b 1 and give rise to\na complete Gunn-Peterson trough. Therefore, the existence of a Gunn-Peterson trough by itself does not prove\nthat the object is observed prior to the reionization epoch.\nEven if the neutral fraction were independent of redshift,\none still expects the transparency of the Ly\u03b1 forest to decrease with increasing redshift. In reality, the expansion of\nthe universe and the increase in the ionizing background\ncause the neutral hydrogen fraction to decrease towards\nlow redshift (see below). The observed redshift evolution\nof the Gunn-Peterson optical depth in the spectrum of\nSDSS 1030+0524 allows us to answer an important question: Is the amount of Ly\u03b1 forest absorption at z \u223c 6 consistent with a simple extrapolation from the observations\nat lower redshifts? Or does it indicate a more dramatic\nchange in the state of the IGM?\nAssuming that the number density of Ly\u03b1 forest lines\nevolves with redshift as (1 + z)\u03b3 , where \u03b3 \u223c 2.5 at z \u223c 4,\nthe effective optical depth evolves as (1 + z)\u03b3+1 (Zuo &\nPhinney 1993, Zuo 1993). The solid line in Figure 2 shows\nan extrapolation of the optical depths to higher redshifts\nusing this simple model. It is evident that the z \u223c 6 value\nfrom SDSS 1030+0524 deviates from this extrapolation;\nthe observed absorption at z \u223c 6 is stronger than that predicted by this model assuming an ionization fraction that\nremains constant with redshift. A natural explanation for\nthis difference is that the ionization fraction increases with\ntime, i.e., the IGM was more neutral at earlier times.\nAssuming that the hydrogen gas in the IGM responsible\nfor the Ly\u03b1 forest absorption is in photoionization equilibrium, wherein photoionization of the neutral hydrogen by\nthe UV background is balanced by recombination, one can\nexpress (nHI /nH ) in equation (1) in terms of the ionizing\nbackground. Doing so, the Gunn-Peterson optical depth\nof a uniform IGM can be expressed as (Weinberg et al.\n1997),\n\u03c4GP = 5.9\u00d710\u22124H0 (1+z)6 H(z)\u22121 h\u22121 T4\u22120.7 (\u03a9b h2 /0.02)2 \u0393\u22121\n\u221212 .\n(2)\nHere, H(z) is the Hubble constant at redshift z, T4 is the\ntemperature of the IGM gas in units of 104 K, and \u0393\u221212 ,\nthe photo-ionization rate of hydrogen in units of 10\u221212\ns\u22121 , depends on the shape and amplitude of the ionizing\nbackground. Thus, in a given background cosmology, the\nobserved evolution of the Gunn-Peterson optical depth can\nbe used to measure the redshift evolution of the ionizing\n\n\f7\n\nFlux (10-18 erg cm-2s-1A-1)\n\n5.8\n10\n8\n6\n4\n\n5.9\n\nRedshift\n6.0\n\n6.1\n\n6.2\n\n6.1\n\n6.2\n\n4\n2\n\nLyman Beta\n\n0\n-2\n\n2\n\nLyman Alpha\n\n0\n5.8\n\n5.9\n\n6.0\nRedshift\n\nFig. 3.- Gunn-Peterson trough in the spectrum of SDSS 1030+0524 observed with Keck/ESI. Both the Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 absorption regions\nare shown. The bottom panel shows the sky-subtracted two-dimensional spectrum in the Ly\u03b1 region. The Ly\u03b1 data come from the ninth\norder of the echellette spectrum and cover the wavelength range 8200\u00c5 to 8810\u00c5. The Ly\u03b2 data are the result of combining orders 7 and 8\nand cover the wavelength range 6920\u00c5 to 7440\u00c5. The green shaded areas are the 1\u03c3 noise bands in the extracted spectra. The spectrum is\nvery black over the redshift range 5.95 < z < 6.16.\n\n\f8\nbackground (e.g., McDonald et al. 2000). A more accurate determination of the ionizing background should also\nmodel the gravitational evolution of the Ly\u03b1 forest with\nredshift. Recently, McDonald & Miralda-Escud\u00e9 (2001)\nused the transmitted flux measurement to calculate the\nevolution of ionizing background at z < 5.2. In a separate\npaper (Fan et al. 2001b), we use both semi-analytic models and cosmological simulations to investigate the evolution of the ionizing background at higher redshifts, using\nthe measured transmitted flux ratios and effective optical\ndepths at z \u223c 6.\nAs discussed by Miralda-Escud\u00e9 (1998), the spectra of\nsources observed prior to complete reionization should\nshow the red damped wing of the Gunn-Peterson trough\nin the red side of Ly\u03b1, due to the very large optical depth.\nThis damped wing would, in principle, suppress the Ly\u03b1\nemission line. However, as shown in Madau & Rees (2000)\nand Cen & Haiman (2000), luminous quasars such as those\ndiscussed in this paper would ionize the surrounding regions and create HII regions of radius several Mpc (the\n\"proximity\" effect; Carswell et al. 1982). The presence\nof these quasar HII regions results in a much higher transmission redward of Ly\u03b1; thus the emission line profile is\nless affected by the red damped wing (see also Fan et al.\n2001b). Therefore, the presence of the Ly\u03b1 emission line,\nand the absence of the red damped wing, are not by themselves indicators that the IGM was already ionized at this\nredshift. The true extent of the proximity effect in SDSS\n1030+0524 is probably best defined by the transmission of\nLy\u03b2 emission at a redshift of 6.18 (see Fig. 3).\nThe size of the HII region associated with the quasar\ndepends on the luminosity and lifetime of the quasar and\nthe clumpiness of the IGM. In principle, we could use the\nproximity effect to constrain the amplitude of the ionizing\nbackground (Bajtlik, Duncan & Ostriker 1988), by determining the distance from the quasar at which the optical\ndepth of the Ly\u03b1 forest is half that in the Gunn-Peterson\ntrough. However, we only have a lower limit on the latter,\nand so at best, we can only put a lower limit on the distance, and thus an upper limit on the ionizing background.\nWe have calculated this upper limit, and find that it gives\na much weaker constraint than comparing the data with\ndetailed simulations (Fan et al. 2001b). Further, clumpiness of the gas distribution near the quasar on these length\nscales will also increase the absorption blueward of Ly\u03b1,\nand hence lead to an artifically higher estimate of the ionizing background.\nCould any local effect produce the apparent GunnPeterson trough in the spectrum of SDSS 1030+0524? A\n300\u00c5 region at z \u223c 6 corresponds to a comoving distance\nof \u223c 70h\u22121 Mpc (\u03a9 = 0.3, \u039b = 0.7), much larger than\nany large scale structure at that redshift. It is also un-\n\nlikely to be a very strong damped Ly\u03b1 absorption system,\nas we do not see any corresponding metal lines (such as\nSiIV\u03bb1402). We are not aware of any known damped Ly\u03b1\nabsorption line at lower redshifts with an EW of \u223c 300\u00c5.\nAt zabs \u223c 6.05, it would have a rest frame EW of \u223c 42\u00c5,\nand NHI \u223c 1021.5 cm\u22122 . Using the statistics of StorrieLombardi, Irwin & McMahon (1996), we expect to find\nonly 0.02 such systems per unit redshift at z \u223c 6. Moreover, one would expect to see associated metal lines from\nsuch a strong absorber, which are clearly not present.\nHowever, we emphasize that the complete GunnPeterson trough is observed in only one (the highestredshift) object, and if the reionization is non-uniform,\none may not see exactly the same dependence of the GunnPeterson trough with redshift along other lines of sight. In\norder to gain a more complete understanding of the IGM\nat z & 6, more lines of sight are clearly needed. The SDSS\nis expected to find \u223c 20 quasars at z & 6 over the course\nof the survey (Paper I), so we can look forward to opportunities to study this question in detail over the next few\nyears.\nThe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is a joint project of\nThe University of Chicago, Fermilab, the Institute for Advanced Study, the Japan Participation Group, The Johns\nHopkins University, the Max-Planck-Institute for Astronomy (MPIA), the Max-Planck-Institute for Astrophysics\n(MPA), New Mexico State University, Princeton University, the United States Naval Observatory, and the University of Washington.
