A recent trend of research in the\nfield of manganites is to study the effect of the reduction of particle size on different properties\nof the materials [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. It has already\nbeen reported that the particle size can have significant influence on the different phenomena\nexhibited by manganites [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20].\nAs a result, the transport, magnetic, magnetotransport and magnetocaloric properties of\nthose materials are observed to be markedly modified when the particle size is reduced to\nthe nanometer scale. The main objective of the present study is to investigate the effect of\nthe lowering of particle size on the magnetocaloric properties of La0.125 Ca0.875 MnO3 . In fact,\nthe study of magnetocaloric properties of materials stimulates considerable research interest\nowing to its possible application in the magnetic refrigeration [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28,\n29].\nIt has been reported that polycrystalline bulk La0.125 Ca0.875 MnO3 shows paramagnetic\nto antiferromagnetic transition at \u223c 125 K with the lowering of temperature [1]. There\nis influence of the presence of inhomogeneous canted antiferromagnetic state on the antiferromagnetic transition for this compound [1]. We have observed inverse magnetocaloric\neffect (IMCE) i.e, minimum in -\u2206S(T) in the vicinity of antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition\ntemperature for the polycrystalline bulk form of the sample. Such a minimum in -\u2206S(T)\nis visible for its nanocrystalline forms around the same temperature as bulk also, which\nimplies the occurring of antiferromagnetic transition for the nanoparticles of this manganite\nsystem. In addition to IMCE, a maximum in -\u2206S(T) arises at low temperate in the cases\nof nanocrystalline sample with the lowest particle size indicating stabilization of ferromagnetic state. The observation of clear signature of AFM transition for La0.125 Ca0.875 MnO3\nnanoparticles directly contradicts the previous experimental results of invisibility of AFM\ntransition for many manganites due to the reduction of particle size [3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15].\nThe polycrystalline and nanocrystalline La0.125 Ca0.875 MnO3 were prepared by solgel\nmethod. The details of the solgel method has been described in our previous article [3].\nAt the end of the solgel process, the decomposed gel was annealed at 1400oC for 36 hours to\nprepare the polycrystalline sample. However, for preparing the nanoparticles of two different average particle size, the decomposed gel was subjected to heat treatment at 1200 and\n10000 C for 6 hours. The x-ray powder diffraction study has confirmed the formation of the\n2\n\n\fsamples with single crystallographic phase. The particle size of the nanocrystalline samples\nwas determined by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) study. The average particle size of\nthe nanocrystalline sample prepared at 12000 C is \u223c 70 nm. On the other hand, the average\nparticle size of the sample synthesized at 10000 C is \u223c 60 nm. The two nanocrystalline\nsamples are designated as S70 (sample with particle size \u223c 70 nm) and S60 (sample with\nparticle size \u223c 60 nm) respectively. The typical SEM micrographs of the two samples have\nbeen given in Fig. 1.\nA commercial SQUID magnetometer was utilized for magnetization measurements. The\nisothermal magnetic field dependence of magnetization [M(H)] at different temperatures has\nbeen studied for the samples (Fig. 2). From the isothermal M(H) curves, the change of the\nmagnetic entropy (-\u2206S) was estimated for various magnetic fields by using the Maxwell's\nrelation [24],\n\u2202S\n\u2202\u03bc0 H\n\n!\n\n=\n\nT\n\n\u2202M\n\u2202T\n\n!\n\n(1)\n\u03bc0 H\n\nThe temperature dependence of -\u2206S for 7 T has been shown in Fig. 3. A minimum in\n-\u2206S(T) (inverse magnetocaloric effect) has been observed at \u223c 125 K for the polycrystalline as well as the nanocrystalline samples. The materials exhibiting IMCE would be\nvery useful for magnetic refrigeration as the refrigerant capacity can be enhanced by utilizing those materials in composite with the conventional magnetic refrigerants [29]. However the manifestation of IMCE in the cases of manganites is rare. For the polycrystalline\nLa0.125 Ca0.875 MnO3 , antiferromagnetic transition occurs at \u223c 125 K [1]. In the cases of\nantiferromagnetic systems, when the applied magnetic field is below the field required for\nthe quenching of antiferromagnetism, the IMCE can be observed [30]. The IMCE for the\npresent polycrystalline sample originates due to the antiferromagnetic transition. Similarly,\nthe minimum in -\u2206S(T) around the same temperature as the polycrystalline sample for\nS70 and S60 can be considered as the signature of the antiferromagnetic transition. There\nare number of studies on different nanocrystalline systems, which reveal that the antiferromagnetic transition in bulk system becomes invisible due to the reduction of particle size\n[3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15]. The present result for the nanocrystalline La0.125 Ca0.875 MnO3 ,\ncontradicts those existing results. The stabilization of antiferromagnetic state in the previous systems is mostly of C-E type and arises as because of the occurrence of charge order\ntransition (COT). In their nanocrystalline form, COT does not occur resulting in the hin-\n\n3\n\n\fdrance of antiferromagnetic transition [3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 16]. The phase diagram of\nLa1\u2212x Cax MnO3 reveals that La0.125 Ca0.875 MnO3 situates at the phase boundary and charge\nordering correlation is hardly present in this compound [1]. The antiferromagnetic state\noriginated in this compound is mixture of C-type and G-type. From the present result, it\nseems that because of different type of antiferromagnetic ordering for La0.125 Ca0.875 MnO3 in\ncomparison to the charge ordered antiferromagnetic state for previous cases, the antiferromagnetic transition can be visible in the nanocrystalline form of this material. An additional\nfeature of -\u2206S(T) for S60 is a clear maximum in low temperature. Such a maximum is an\nindication of the onset of ferromagnetism for that nanocrystalline sample. Very recent theoretical study predicts that the ferromagnetic correlation can be originated due to the surface\neffect in the cases of fine particles of manganites [10]. The signature of ferromagnetism at\nlow temperature in the -\u2206S(T) observed for S60 can be attributed to the surface effect in\naccordance to the theoretical prediction [10]. For the nanocrystalline samples, the surface\neffect becomes more dominant as the particle size of the sample reduces. It appears that the\nsurface effect for S70 is not so enough to create ferromagnetic state. However in the case\nof S60 with lower particle size, surface effect can be more dominant giving rise to ferromagnetism at low temperature. The M-H curves at 45 K and 95 K for the two samples are also\ndifferent. There is a cross over between M-H curves at 45 K and 95 K in the low magnetic\nfield region for S70 like its bulk form. This cross over between two M-H curves is absent for\nS60 (Fig. 2).\nTo summarize, we have observed IMCE for polycrystalline as well as nanocrystalline\nLa0.125 Ca0.875 MnO3 due to the antiferromagnetic transition. The evidence of antiferromagnetic transition in the cases of nanocrystalline manganites is in direct contradiction of existing experimental results for different manganite systems [3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 16].\nReduction of particle size has also pronounced effect on the magnetocaloric properties of this\nmaterial as an additional maximum is visible in -\u2206S(T) for the sample with average particle\nsize 60 nm. The observation of IMCE is very rare especially in the cases of rare-earth based\nmanganites.\n\n4\n\n\f[1] Colossal Magnetoresistive Oxides, Ed. Y.
