QPTs are fundamentally different from\ntheir classical counter parts at finite T , where the transition is due to thermal fluctuations of the order parameter. QPTs can be induced in a wide range of materials,\nsuch as correlated metals [2], cuprate superconductors\n[3], common metals [4] and the two-dimensional electron gas [5]. This is accomplished by adjusting a control parameter (e.g. pressure p, doping x, magnetic field\nB, or electron density) in order to tune the system to a\nquantum critical point (QCP). At this point the quantum critical fluctuations give rise to unusual temperature\nlaws (non-Fermi liquid behavior (nFL)) for the magnetic,\nthermal and transport parameters [7], and new collective\nstates may emerge, e.g. unconventional superconducting\n[8] or electronic states [9]. This in turn calls for novel\nconcepts and theories [2, 10, 11]. In order to provide a\nfruitful testing ground, it is important to identify new\nsystems and to investigate their critical behavior.\nStrongly correlated electron systems, notably heavyfermion compounds based on the f -elements Ce, Yb\nor U, are especially suited to study magnetic\u2212to\u2212nonmagnetic QPTs, because the ordering temperatures are\nlow (\u223c 10 K) and the exchange interaction can be modified relatively easily by an external control parameter.\nCurrently, there are two central questions that are being addressed by studying QPTs in these materials. The\nfirst issue is the fate of the quasiparticles when the antiferromagnetic (AF) or ferromagnetic (FM) phase is entered. In the conventional scenario a spin density wave\nis formed [6, 7] and the quasiparticles preserve their itinerant character (as in CeIn3\u2212x Snx [12]). Because the\nitinerant model is unable to account for the nFL behavior in certain materials, an alternative local quantum criticality model has been put forward [2, 10, 11].\n\nHere the quasiparticles (Kondo-screened moments) decompose at the critical point in conduction electrons\nand local f -moments that undergo magnetic order (as in\nCeCu6\u2212x Aux [2] and YbRh2 (Si1\u2212x Gex )2 [13]). The second captivating issue is the emergence of unconventional\nsuperconducting (SC) states near the pressure induced\nQCPs in CePd2 Si2 , CeIn3 [8] and UGe2 [14]. Evidence\nis at hand that in these materials unconventional pairing\nis realized (d-wave pairing for the AF and p-wave pairing for the FM systems). This strongly suggests Cooper\npairing mediated by AF or FM spin fluctuations rather\nthan by phonons. The coexistence of FM order and SC\nin UGe2 (and possibly in UIr [15]) under pressure, is uncommon in nature and attracts much attention.\nIn this paper we provide evidence for a ferromagnetic\nQPT in URhGe doped with Ru. Our research is motivated by the unique properties of the parent compound\nURhGe at ambient pressure: (i) SC below Ts = 0.25 K\ncoexists with itinerant FM order (Curie temperature\nTC = 9.5 K) [16], and (ii) re-entrant SC is induced by applying a large magnetic field (B \u223c 12 T) [17]. These observations immediately prompted the question whether\none can tune URhGe to a FM QCP by mechanical or\nchemical pressure, with the objective to probe the quantum critical fluctuations and possibly link these to the\nSC pairing mechanism. Resistivity measurements under\nhydrostatic pressure, however, revealed that TC increases\nat a rate of 0.065 K/kbar [18]. Also, upon the application of uniaxial pressure TC increases as was extracted\nfrom the Ehrenfest relation [19]. As regards to chemical\npressure, best candidate dopants are Ru and Co, since\namong the neighboring isostructural UTX compounds\n(T = transition metal and X = Ge or Si) only URuGe\nand UCoGe have a paramagnetic ground state [20, 21].\nIndeed, FM order in URhGe can be suppressed by replacing Rh by Ru and vanishes at 38 at.% Ru [22, 23].\nHere we investigate the thermal, transport and magnetic\n\n\f2\n\nx = 0.38\n\nU(Rh\n\n1-\n\nx\n\nRu )Ge\n\nx\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.35\n\n2\n\n/T (J/molK )\n\n0.30\n\n0.25\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.20\n0.5\n\nm\n\nc\n\nproperties of URh1\u2212x Rux Ge alloys near the critical concentration xcr = 0.38. The observed nFL T dependencies of the specific heat and electrical resistivity, together\nwith the smooth suppression of the ordered moment, provide evidence for a continuous FM QPT. This classifies\nURh1\u2212x Rux Ge as one of the scarce f -electron systems\nin which a FM QCP can be reached by doping (a FM\nQPT was also reported for CePd1\u2212x Rhx [24], but here\nthe transition is \"smeared\").\nPolycrystalline URh1\u2212x Rux Ge samples with 0.0 \u2264 x \u2264\n0.60 were prepared by arc-melting the constituents U,\nRh, Ru (all 3N) and Ge (5N) under a high-purity argon atmosphere in a water-cooled copper crucible. The\nas-cast samples were wrapped in Ta foil and annealed under high vacuum in quartz tubes for 10 days at 875 \u25e6 C.\nSamples were cut by spark-erosion. Electron probe micro analysis showed the single phase nature of the samples within the resolution of 2%. X-ray powder diffraction confirmed the orthorhombic TiNiSi structure (space\ngroup P nma) [25, 26]. Upon substituting Ru the unit\ncell volume \u03a9 = 224.3 \u00c53 of URhGe decreases linearly at\na rate of 0.067 \u00c53 per at.% Ru (i.e. \u2206\u03a9 = 1.1 % at xcr )\nin an anisotropic way, the main effect being the reduction\nof the a lattice parameter [23].\nThe specific heat c(T ) was measured down to 0.4\nK using a semi-adiabatic method in a home-built 3 He\nsystem. Electrical resistivity \u03c1(T ) data were collected\nin a commercial 3 He system (Heliox - Oxford Instruments, T \u2265 0.25 K) using a low frequency ac-resistance\nbridge. The thermal expansion \u03b1(T ) was measured using\na parallel-plate capacitance dilatometer in the T range\n1-15 K. The dc magnetization M (T ) (T \u2265 1.8 K) was\nobtained using a Quantum Design SQUID magnetometer. Temperature scans in magnetic fields B up to 5 T\nwere made after field cooling.\nThe overall effect of Ru doping on ferromagnetism in\nURhGe is presented in Fig.1, where we have plotted the\nf -electron specific heat cm , obtained after subtracting\nthe lattice contribution (clat = \u03b2 T 3 for T \u2264 20 K with\n\u03b2 = 0.60 * 10\u22123 J/mol K4 [25]), as cm /T vs log T for\n0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.50. Upon doping, TC initially increases, but\nfor x \u2265 0.10 the ordering peak shifts towards lower T\nand weakens. Values of TC (x), identified by the inflection points in c/T vs T (on a linear T scale) at the high T\nside of the peaks, are traced in Fig.2a and are in excellent\nagreement with the values determined from M (T ) and\n\u03c1(T ) [22]. For x \u2265 0.20 TC decreases linearly with x at a\nrate of 0.45 K/at.% Ru. For x = 0 the magnetic specific\nheat for T \u2264 5 K is described by cm (T ) = \u03b3T + \u03b4T 3/2 ,\nwhere \u03b3 is the linear coefficient of the electronic specific\nheat and the second term is the spin wave contribution\n[27]. The values for \u03b3 and \u03b4 extracted by fitting the\ndata (see Fig.1) are in good agreement with the values\nreported in Ref.[25]. Upon doping Ru an energy gap \u2206\nopens in the magnon spectrum and the specific heat for\nx = 0.05 and 0.10 now follows the relation (T \u2264 5 K)\n\n0.15\n\n0.10\n\n1\n\nT (K)\n\n10\n\nFIG. 1: f -electron specific heat of URh1\u2212x Rux Ge plotted as\ncm /T vs log T for 0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.50 as indicated. For x \u2264 0.10 the\ndata are fitted to cm (T ) = \u03b3T +\u03b4T 3/2 e\u2212\u2206/kB T with \u03b3-, \u03b4- and\n\u2206/kB -values of 0.150, 0.146 and 0.136 J/molK2 , 0.024, 0.041\nand 0.094 J/molK5/2 and 0, 6.5 and 10.6 K for x = 0, 0.05\nand 0.10, respectively (solid lines for x = 0 and x = 0.10;\ndata for x = 0.05 not shown). The arrow indicates TC for\nx = 0.35. For xcr = 0.38 cm /T \u223c ln T over one and a half\ndecade in T (straight solid line).\n\ncm (T ) = \u03b3T + \u03b4T 3/2 e\u2212\u2206/kB T [27] (see fits in Fig.1). The\nmost important result of our specific heat experiments\nhowever is the pronounced cm (T ) = \u2212bT ln(T /T0 ) dependence for xcr , where b = 0.062 J/mol K2 and T0 =\n41 K. This nFL term is observed over one and a half\ndecade in T (0.5 \u2212 9 K). At xcr c/T |0.5K (x) has a maximum (Fig.2c). The total f -electron entropy obtained by\nintegrating cm /T vs T between 0.5 and \u223c 15 K amounts\nto \u223c 0.48R ln 2 for x = 0 and decreases to 0.33R ln 2\nat xcr . Its small value confirms the itinerant nature of\nthe FM transition (the ordered moment m0 is 0.4 \u03bcB for\nx = 0 [16, 25]).\nThe electrical resistivity of URh1\u2212x Rux Ge (x \u2264 0.60)\nat high T [23] shows the behavior typical for a FM\nKondo-lattice. The data for x = 0.38 are shown in the\ninset in Fig.3, where the maximum near 130 K signals the\nformation of the Kondo-lattice. For the FM compounds\nat low T a kink in \u03c1(T ) (and maximum in d\u03c1(T )/dT )\nmarks TC . For all doped samples the total resistivity\ndrop in the T interval 0-300 K is \u223c150-250 \u03bc\u03a9cm, which\nis usual for uranium intermetallics [21]. However, the\nresidual resistivity values \u03c10 are large (\u223c 200-300 \u03bc\u03a9cm),\nwhich is due to the brittleness of the samples (cracks).\nConsequently, the RRR values (R(300K)/R(0K)) are\nsmall (\u223c 2). In Fig.3 we show \u03c1(T ) at low T for\n0.10 \u2264 x \u2264 0.60.

Therefore, we conclude that scattering from\nmagnons can be neglected in our polycrystalline samples\nand we restrict the analysis to fitting \u03c1(T ) = \u03c10 + AT n\n(see Fig.3). The values of n extracted (by taking the best\nfit over the largest T interval) are shown in Fig.2c. n(x)\nattains a minimum value n = 1.2 at xcr , followed by a\nslow recovery to the FL value n = 2 there above.\nThe magnetization M (T ) for all samples was measured\nin B = 0.01 T and 1 T down to 1.8 K. In addition M (B)\nwas measured at fixed T in order to produce Arrott plots\n(M 2 vs B/M ). M |2K -values are traced in Fig.2b. For\npure URhGe M |2K in 1 T \u2243 0.2 \u03bcB in agreement with\nthe polycrystalline average 12 m0 for a uniaxial FM (m0 =\n0.4 \u03bcB directed along the c-axis [16]). In 0.01 T a reduced\nvalue M |2K \u2243 0.11 \u03bcB is observed due to demagnetizing\neffects. Values of TC (Fig.2a) were determined from the\ninflection points in M (T ) in 0.01 T and from the Arrott\nplots. For x \u2265 0.38 the Arrott plots (T \u2265 1.8 K) no\nlonger indicate magnetic order (see inset in Fig.2b for\nx = 0.38). A most important feature of the data is the\ngradual decrease of M |2K (x). For B = 0.01 T M |2K (x)\nsmoothly goes to 0 at x = 0.35 (TC = 1.3 \u00b1 0.1 K),\nwhile for B = 1 T a finite field induced M |2K remains.\nWe conclude that the FM-paramagnetic transition as a\nfunction of x is a continuous (2nd order) phase transition.\n\n250\n0\n\ncm\n\nx=0.50\n\nRuthenium concentration x\n\nFIG. 2: (a) Curie temperature of URh1\u2212x Rux Ge determined\nfrom c(T ) (N), \u03c1(T ) (\u2022) and M (T ) (\u22c6).

Inset:\nGr\u00fcneisen ratio \u0393 as a function of T .\n\n(\u03b2 = \u03a3i \u03b1i ) in order to eliminate possible anisotropy effects due to crystallites with preferred orientations. The\nT dependence of \u03b2 at low T is weaker than that of the\nspecific heat (see Fig.4). Concurrently, the Gr\u00fcneisen\nratio \u0393 = Vm \u03b2/\u03bac decreases below T \u223c 7 K (here the\nmolar volume Vm = 3.36 \u00d7 10\u22125 m3 /mol and isothermal\ncompressibility \u03ba \u2243 10\u221211 Pa\u22121 [23]). The quasi-linear\nbehavior of \u0393(T ) for 1 K \u2264 T \u2264 5 K suggests an unusual\nT variation of \u03b2, i.e. roughly proportional to T 2 ln T .\nHaving documented the critical behavior of the\nURh1\u2212x Rux Ge alloys we conclude that our c(T ), \u03c1(T )\nand M (T ) data provide evidence for a continuous FM\n\n\f4\nQPT with xcr = 0.38. The most compelling evidence\nis the specific heat ccr \u223c T ln(T /T0 ) observed over one\nand a half decade in T (Fig.1) [7] and the concomitant maximum in c/T |0.5K (x) (Fig.2c). The temperature T0 = 41 K is large, which indicates that our c(T )\nexperiments down to T = 0.4 K (T /T0 \u2243 0.01) indeed\nprobe the quantum critical regime. It will be interesting\nto investigate whether the c/T \u223c lnT behavior persists\neven at lower T . Eventually, however, c/T will saturate because of crystallographic disorder inherent to the\nURh1\u2212x Rux Ge alloys. Further support for a QCP is provided by the critical behavior in the resistivity \u03c1cr \u223c T 1.2\nup to 2 K. The exponent n(x) has a pronounced minimum at xcr (Fig.2c). The value n = 1.2 is smaller than\nthe value n = 5/3 predicted for a clean FM QCP [29].\nThis is not unexpected as disorder reduces n [30]. The\nitinerant nature of the FM state and the smooth suppression of m0 pointing to a continuous phase transition,\nstrongly suggest that the QPT in URh1\u2212x Rux Ge is of\nthe Hertz-Millis type [6, 7], albeit with modified exponents due to the effects of doping (notably emptying the\nd-band and alloy disorder). For instance, for an itinerant\nclean FM QPT one expects TC \u223c (xc \u2212 x)3/4 (dimension\nd = 3, dynamical critical exponent z = 3), while we obtain TC \u223c (xc \u2212 x) over a wide range 0.20 \u2264 x \u2264 0.35.\nDeviations from the clean behavior are also observed\nin f -electron materials with a pressure induced continuous FM QPT, like CeSi1.81 [31]. On the other hand,\nfor d-electron alloys with a continuous FM QPT (e.g.\nNix Pd1\u2212x [32] and Zr1\u2212x Nbx Zn2 [33]) the data are to a\nlarge extent in agreement with the itinerant model. Further theoretical work is required to clarify these issues.\nFinally, we discuss our results for the thermal expansion and the Gr\u00fcneisen parameter. The finite \u0393-value at\nlow T is at variance with the recent prediction of a diverging Gr\u00fcneisen ratio \u0393 \u223c T \u22121/z\u03bd at the QCP (\u03bd is the correlation length exponent) [34]. For the case of an itinerant FM QCP the scaling results are \u03b2cr \u223c T 1/3 and ccr \u223c\nT log(1/T ), whence \u0393cr \u223c \u03b2cr /ccr \u223c ((T 2/3 log(1/T ))\u22121\n[34]. While the specific heat follows the expected behavior, the thermal expansion clearly does not (\u03b2 \u223c T 2 ln T\nfor 1 K \u2264 T \u2264 5 K). With the value T0 = 41 K extracted from ccr we calculate that \u0393cr within the scenario\nof Ref.[34] should have a minimum near 8 K and diverge\nat lower T . This is obviously not the case experimentally\n(Fig.4). The only other system for which the Gr\u00fcneisen\nratio near a FM QPT has been investigated so far is\nCePd1\u2212x Rhx [35]. In this system a non-diverging (T independent) \u0393 was also observed in the critical regime.\nIn conclusion, we have investigated the thermal, transport and magnetic properties of URh1\u2212x Rux Ge near the\ncritical concentration for the suppression of FM order.\nAt xcr = 0.38 c \u223c T ln T , the \u03b3-value c/T |0.5K has a\nmaximum and the T exponent in the resistivity attains\nthe nFL value n = 1.2. Together with the gradual suppression of the ordered moment m0 the data provide ev-\n\nidence for a continuous FM quantum phase transition.\nThis offers the sole opportunity thus far to investigate\nFM spin fluctuations in URhGe under quantum critical\nconditions. The identification of the FM QCP at ambient pressure in URhGe doped with Ru paves the road to\na host of experiments on this unique material.\nThis work was part of the research program of FOM\n(Dutch Foundation for Fundamental Research of Matter)\nand COST Action P16 ECOM.\n\nElectronic address: devisser@science.uva.nl\n[1] See e.g. S.
