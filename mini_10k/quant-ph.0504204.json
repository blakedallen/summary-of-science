We shall also call them states for brevity, having\nin mind that a density operator \u03c1 uniqiely determines a normal state on\nthe algebra of all bounded operators in H. Equipped with the trace-norm\ndistance, S(H) is a complete separable metric space. It is known [2], [3]\n\u2217\n\nSteklov Mathematical Institute, Moscow, Russia.\nPart of this work was done when the author was visiting the Institute of Mathematical Physics, TU Braunschweig in frame of the A. von Humboldt Foundation Follow-up\nProgram.\n\u2021\nInstitute of Mathematical Physics, TU Braunschweig.\n\u2020\n\n1\n\n\fthat a sequence of quantum states converging to a state in the weak operator\ntopology converges to it in the trace norm.\nIf \u03c0 is a Borel probability measure on S(H), the relation\nZ\n\u03c1\u0304(\u03c0) =\n\u03c3\u03c0(d\u03c3),\n(1)\nS(H)\n\nwhere the integral exists as Bochner integral, defines a state called barycenter\nof \u03c0. Let P be a set of Borel probability measures on S(H). Recall that weak\nconvergence of probability measures means convergence of integrals of all\ncontinuous bounded functions (see e. g. [8]). By using the above mentioned\nresult in [2], [3] it is easy to see that the map \u03c0 7\u2192 \u03c1\u0304(\u03c0) from P onto S(H)\nis continuous. The following result was established in [5]:\nTheorem 1. The set P is weakly compact if and only if its image A\nunder the map \u03c0 7\u2192 \u03c1\u0304(\u03c0) given by (1) is a compact subset of S(H).\nThe following lemma is an amplified version of the Choquet decomposition\n[1] adapted to the case of closed convex subsets of S(H). We denote by coA\n(coA) the convex hull (closure) of a set A [7].\nLemma 1. Let A be a closed subset of S(H). Then coA coincides with\nthe set of barycenters of all Borel probability measures supported by A.\nProof. Let \u03c10 \u2208 coA. Then there is a sequence {\u03c1n } \u2286 coA converging\nto \u03c10 , so that {\u03c1n } is relatively compact in S(H). The density operator \u03c1n is\nbarycenter of Borel probability measure \u03c0n finitely supported on A. By the\ncompactness criterion of theorem 1, the sequence {\u03c0n } is weakly relatively\ncompact and thus has a partial limit \u03c00 , which is supported Rby the set A due\nto theorem 6.1 in [8]. Continuity of the map \u03c0 7\u2192 \u03c1\u0304(\u03c0) = \u03c3\u03c0(d\u03c3) implies\nthat the state \u03c10 is the barycenter of the measure \u03c00 .\nConversely, let \u03c0 be an arbitrary probability measure supported by A. By\ntheorem 6.31 in [8] this measure can be weakly approximated by a sequence\nof measures \u03c0n finitely supported by A. Since \u03c1\u0304(\u03c0n ) is in coA for all n we\nconclude that \u03c1\u0304(\u03c0) is in coA due to continuity of the map \u03c0 7\u2192 \u03c1\u0304(\u03c0). \u0003\nDefinition 1. A state in S(H \u2297 K) is called separable if it is in the\nconvex closure of the set of all product states in S(H \u2297 K).\nLemma 1 implies that separable states are precisely those states which\nadmit the representation\nZ\nZ\n\u03c1=\n(\u03c1H \u2297 \u03c1K ) \u03bc(d\u03c1H d\u03c1K ),\n(2)\nS(H)\n\n1\n\nS(K)\n\nMore precisely, it follows from the construction used in the proof of this theorem.\n\n2\n\n\fwhere \u03bc is a Borel probability measure on S(H) \u00d7 S(K). In the finite dimensional case application of Caratheodory's theorem reduces this to the\nfamiliar definition of separable state as finite convex combination of product\nstates [11]. If for a separable state \u03c1 it is possible to find a representation (2)\nwith purely atomic \u03bc, we call the state countably decomposable. A necessary\ncondition for this is existence of nonzero vectors |\u03b1i \u2208 H, |\u03b2i \u2208 K such that\n\u03c1 \u2265 |\u03b1ih\u03b1| \u2297 |\u03b2ih\u03b2|,\n\n(3)\n\ncf. [12]. In Sec. 2 we shall show that there are many separable states which\ndo not satisfy this condition and hence are not countably decomposable.\nIn the definition 1 one can replace the set of all product states by the\nset of all products of pure states. It is known that the subset P(H) of pure\nstates (extreme points of S(H)) is closed in the trace-norm topology. The\nlemma 1 then implies that a state \u03c1 is separable if and only if there is a Borel\nmeasure \u03bd on P(H) \u00d7 P(K) such that, with some abuse of notation,\nZ\nZ\n\u03c1=\n|\u03c6ih\u03c6| \u2297 |\u03c8ih\u03c8|\u03bd(d\u03c6d\u03c8).\n(4)\nP(H)\n\n3\n\nP(K)\n\nEntanglement-breaking channels\n\nA channel is a linear map \u03a6:T(H) 7\u2192 T(H\u2032 ) with the properties:\n1) \u03a6(S(H)) \u2286 S(H\u2032 ); this implies that \u03a6 is bounded map and hence\nis uniquely determined by the infinite matrix [\u03a6 (|iihj|)] , where {|ii} is an\northonormal basis in H.\n2) The matrix [\u03a6 (|iihj|)] is positive definite in the sense that for a collection of vectors {|\u03c8i i} \u2286 H with finite number of nonzero elements\nX\nh\u03c8i |\u03a6 (|iihj|) |\u03c8j i \u2265 0.\n(5)\nij\n\nDefinition 2. A channel \u03a6 is called entanglement-breaking if for arbitrary Hilbert space K and arbitrary state \u03c9 \u2208 S(H\u2297K) the state (\u03a6\u2297IdK )(\u03c9),\nwhere IdK is the identity channel in S(K), is separable.\nNote that in this definition one can restrict to finite dimensional Hilbert\nspaces K. Indeed, an arbitrary state \u03c9 in S(H \u2297 K) with an infinite dimensional K can be approximated by the states\n\u03c9n = (Tr(IH \u2297 Qn )\u03c9)\u22121(IH \u2297 Qn )\u03c9(IH \u2297 Qn ),\n3\n\n\fwhere {Qn } is the sequence of the spectral projectors of the partial state TrH \u03c9\ncorresponding to its n largest eigenvalues. Each state \u03c9n can be considered\nas a state in S(H \u2297 Kn ), where Kn = Qn (K) is n-dimensional Hilbert space.\nIf (\u03a6 \u2297 Id)(\u03c9n ) is separable for all n, then (\u03a6 \u2297 Id)(\u03c9) is also separable as a\nlimit of sequence of separable states.\nThe following theorem is a generalization of the result in [6] to the infinite\ndimensional case.\nTheorem 2. Channel \u03a6 is entanglement-breaking if and only if there is a\ncomplete separable metric space X , a Borel S(H\u2032 )-valued function x 7\u2192 \u03c1\u2032 (x)\nand a positive operator-valued Borel measure (POVM) M(dx) on X such that\nZ\n\u03a6(\u03c1) = \u03c1\u2032 (x)\u03bc\u03c1 (dx),\n(6)\nX\n\nwhere \u03bc\u03c1 (B) = Tr\u03c1M(B) for all Borel B \u2286 X .\nProof. Notice first that conditions 1),2) in the definition of channel\nare readily verified for the map (6). Let us show that the channel (6) is\nentanglement-breaking. Let \u03c9 \u2208 S(H \u2297 K), where K is a finite dimensional\nHilbert space. We have\nZ\n(\u03a6 \u2297 IdK )(\u03c9) = \u03c1\u2032 (x) \u2297 m\u03c9 (dx),\n(7)\nX\n\nwhere\nm\u03c9 (B) = TrH \u03c9(M(B) \u2297 IK ),\n\nB \u2286 X.\n\nIt is easy to see that any matrix element of m\u03c9 (in a particular basis) is\na complex valued measure on X absolutely continuous with respect to the\nprobability measure \u03bc\u03c9 (B) = Trm\u03c9 (B), B \u2286 X . The Radon-Nikodym\ntheorem implies representation\nZ\nm\u03c9 (B) = \u03c3\u03c9 (x)\u03bc\u03c9 (dx),\nB\n\nwhere \u03c3\u03c9 (x) is a function on X taking values in S(K). By using this representation we can rewrite (7) as\nZ\n(\u03a6 \u2297 IdK )(\u03c9) = \u03c1\u2032 (x) \u2297 \u03c3\u03c9 (x)\u03bc\u03c9 (dx),\n(8)\nX\n\n4\n\n\fwhich reduces to (2) by change of variables and hence is separable by Lemma\n1.\nConversely, let \u03a6 be an entanglement-breaking channel. Fix a state \u03c3 in\nS(H) of full rank and let {|ii}+\u221e\ni=1 be the basis of eigenvectors of \u03c3 with the\ncorresponding (positive) eigenvalues {\u03bbi }+\u221e\ni=1 . Consider the vector\n|\u03a9i =\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\n1/2\n\n\u03bbi |ii \u2297 |ii\n\ni=1\n\nin the space H \u2297 H.

A natural question is: for\nan arbitrary entanglement-breaking channel, is it possible to find a representation (6) with a purely atomic POVM? From the proof of the theorem one\ncan see that this is the case if and only if the state (9) is countably decomposable, hence, as we show in the next section, the answer is negative. This\nimplies existence of an entanglement-breaking channel, which has no Kraus\nrepresentation with operators of rank 1, in contrast to the finite dimensional\ncase [6]. Indeed, it is easy to see that such a Kraus representation with operators of rank 1 is equivalent to a representation (6) of this channel with a\npurely atomic POVM.\n\n4\n\nExample\n\nWe shall consider the one-dimensional rotation group represented as the\ninterval [0, 2\u03c0) with addition mod2\u03c0.

For technical convenience we will assume that\nthe functions \u03bbj (x) have finite number of nonzero Fourier coefficients. Introducing\n+\u221e\nX\n(j)\n\u03bcj (x) = h\u03bbj |Vx |\u03c6j i =\nh\u03bbj |kihk|\u03c6j ieikx ,\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\nso that hk|\u03bcj i = h\u03bbj |kihk|\u03c6j i, we see that \u03bcj 7\u2192 h\u03bbj |\u03b1j i are linear functionals of \u03bcj running over the subspace of trigonometric polynomials in\nL2 [0; 2\u03c0). These functional are in fact continuous. Indeed, choosing k such\nthat hk|\u03b12 i =\n6 0, we find from (18)\nhk|\u03c62 i\n|h\u03bb1|\u03b11 i| \u2264\nhk|\u03b12 i\n2\n\n2\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n0\n\n|\u03bc1 (x)|2\n\ndx\n2\u03c0\n\nfor all trigonometric polynomials \u03bc1 .

Applying similar reasoning to\nj = 2, we can transform (18) to the form\nZ 2\u03c0\ndx\n2\n2\n,\n(19)\n|h\u03b21 |\u03bc1 i| |h\u03b22 |\u03bc2i| \u2264\n|\u03bc1 (x)\u03bc2 (x)|2\n2\u03c0\n0\nwhere \u03b2j \u2208 L2 [0; 2\u03c0).\nNow we can extend the inequality (19) to more general functions \u03bcj for\nwhich both sides of this inequality are defined e. g. measurable a. e. uniformly bounded functions on [0; 2\u03c0]. The characteristic functions of intervals\nbelong to this class, and so is a dense set of functions with support in any\nspecified interval.\nConsider a partitioning of the interval [0, 2\u03c0] into intervals of length \u2264 \u03b5,\nand pick one of these intervals, say I2 , on which \u03b22 is not a.e. zero. Then\nwe can find an admissible function \u03bc2 supported in I2 such that h\u03b22 |\u03bc2 i =\n6 0.\nBut then, for any \u03bc1 supported on the complement of I2 , the right hand side\nof (19) vanishes, and therefore \u03b21 vanishes a.e. on the complement of I2 . It\nfollows that the support of \u03b21 has measure \u2264 \u03b5 for all \u03b5, i.e., \u03b21 vanishes a.e.,\nand hence \u03b11 = 0. \u0003\nLet W be the subset of all separable states which are not countably\ndecomposable.\nCorollary.

For\nentanglement-breaking channels the \u03c7- capacity is additive (for the infinitedimensional case see [9]), hence it gives the classical capacity of the channel.\nTheorem 4.

Let us first show that the closure of ran\u03a6 = \u03a6 (S(H)) coincides\nwith the set\nco {Vx |\u03c6ih\u03c6|Vx\u2217 ; x \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0]} .\n(22)\n9\n\n\fBy (14) and using the fact that arbitrary probability density p(*) can be\nobtained as the diagonal value of a density operator (in fact, of a pure state),\nwe have\n\u001aZ 2\u03c0\n\u001b\ndx\n\u2217\nran\u03a6 =\nVx |\u03c6ih\u03c6|Vx p(x) ; p(*) \u2208 P ,\n(23)\n2\u03c0\n0\nwhere P is the convex set of probability densities on [0, 2\u03c0]. The set of\nabsolutely continuous probability measures is weakly dense in the Choquet\nsimplex M of all Borel probability measures on [0, 2\u03c0], while the map\nZ 2\u03c0\n\u03bc 7\u2192\nVx |\u03c6ih\u03c6|Vx\u2217 \u03bc(dx)\n0\n\nis continuous (due to the aforementioned result in [2], [3]), therefore the set\n(23) is dense in the compact convex set\n\u001aZ 2\u03c0\n\u001b\n\u2217\nVx |\u03c6ih\u03c6|Vx \u03bc(dx); \u03bc \u2208 M ,\n0\n\nwhich coincides with the set (22) by lemma 1.\nNow suppose C(\u03a6) is finite. By proposition 1 in [9] there exists the unique\nstate \u03a9(\u03a6) in ran\u03a6 such that\nC(\u03a6) = sup H(\u03a6(\u03c1); \u03a9(\u03a6)).\n\n(24)\n\n\u03c1\u2208S(H)\n\nThe uniqueness of this state and the covariance (13) imply Vx \u03a9(\u03a6)Vx\u2217 = \u03a9(\u03a6)\nfor all x and hence\nZ 2\u03c0\n\u221e\nX\ndx\n\u03a9(\u03a6) =\nVx |\u03c6ih\u03c6|Vx\u2217\n|hk|\u03c6i|2|kihk|.\n=\u2212\n2\u03c0\n0\nk=\u2212\u221e\nSince ran\u03a6 is dense in the set (22), and the relative entropy is lower semicontinuous and convex, we see that the supremum (24) is equal to H(|\u03c6ih\u03c6|; \u03a9(\u03a6)),\nso we have\nC(\u03a6) = \u2212h\u03c6| log \u03a9(\u03a6)|\u03c6i = H (\u03a9(\u03a6))\nwhich is equal to the right side of (21).\nTo complete the proof it is sufficient to show that\n\u2212\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n|hk|\u03c6i|2 log |hk|\u03c6i|2 < \u221e\n\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\n10\n\n(25)\n\n\fimplies finiteness of the capacity C(\u03a6). Let us show first that (25) implies\ncontinuity of the output entropy H(\u03a6(\u03c1)). Indeed, assuming (25) one can\nfind a sequence {hk } of positive numbers such that hk \u2191 +\u221e with |k| \u2191 +\u221e\nand\n+\u221e\nX\nhk |hk|\u03c6i|2(\u2212 log |hk|\u03c6i|2) \u2261 h < \u221e.\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\nIntroducing selfadjoint operator\nH=\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\nhk (\u2212 log |hk|\u03c6i|2)|kihk|,\n\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\nwe have\nTr exp(\u2212\u03b2H) =\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\n|hk|\u03c6i|2\u03b2hk < \u221e;\n\n\u03b2 > 0,\n\n(26)\n\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\nsince \u03b2hk \u2265 1 for all sufficiently large k. By (23), for arbitrary \u03c1 \u2208 ran\u03a6\nR 2\u03c0\nthere is a probability measure \u03bc such that \u03c1 = 0 Vx |\u03c6ih\u03c6|Vx\u2217 \u03bc(dx).
