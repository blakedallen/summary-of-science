It is based on a missing partner mechanism which is\nrealized with the 126 + 126 Higgs superfields. These Higgs fields, which are also needed for\ngenerating Majorana right\u2013handed neutrino masses, contain a pair of color triplets in excess\nof weak doublets. This feature enables us to remove the color triplets from the low energy\nspectrum without fine\u2013tuning. We give all the needed ingredients for a successful implementation of the missing partner mechanism in SO(10) and present explicit models wherein the\nHiggs doublet mass is protected against possible non\u2013renormalizable corrections to all orders.\nWe also show how realistic fermion masses can be generated in this context.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nUnification of the different forces of Nature is a long sought\u2013after dream of physicists. Embedding\nthe strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces into a single force represented by a Grand Unified\nsymmetry [1] provides a major step in this endeavor. In such Grand Unified Theories (GUT),\nnot only are the Standard Model (SM) gauge interaction unified at high energies, but the matter\nfields \u2013 quark and leptons \u2013 are also unified, fitting into common multiplets of the GUT symmetry\ngroup. This unification of matter fields provides a simple understanding of the quantum numbers\nof quarks and leptons. It is remarkable that with the inclusion of low energy supersymmetry, the\nSM gauge couplings, when extrapolated from their precisely known values at low energies, all meet\nat a common point at a scale of MX \u2243 2 \u00d7 1016 GeV. TeV scale supersymmetry (SUSY) is perhaps\nthe most widely anticipated new physics for the LHC era, since it provides a resolution to the gauge\nhierarchy problem. It is no wonder that supersymmetric grand unified theories have had a major\ninfluence in our thinking of physics beyond the Standard Model over the last twenty five years.\nGrand unification also predicts another, perhaps unwanted, unification: the Higgs doublet fields,\nwhich must survive to low energies for spontaneous breaking of the electroweak gauge symmetry,\nare unified with color triplet partners. These color triplet Higgs fields must have masses of order\nthe GUT scale, or else they will upset the successful unification of gauge couplings, and will lead to\nproton decay with an unacceptably large rate. A major challenge for GUT model building is then\nto come up with a mechanism which makes the electronweak Higgs doublets light while their color\ntriplet partners remain heavy. This is perhaps the thorniest problem facing grand unified model\nbuilding, and goes by the name doublet\u2013triplet (DT) splitting problem.\nIn SUSY SU(5), which is the prototype for SUSY GUTs [2], the Higgs doublets hu,d of MSSM\nare contained in 5 + 5 representations. Under SU(3)c \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y , the 5 breaks up as\n5 = hu (1, 2, 1/2) + T (3, 1, \u22121/3), while 5 = hd (1, 2, \u22121/2) + T (3, 1, 1/3). The superpotential for\nthe model contains two terms involving the 5 + 5: W \u2283 M5 5 * 5 + \u03bb 5 * 5 * 24 where the 24 is the\nHiggs field that breaks SU(5) down to the SM gauge symmetry with a vacuum expectation value\nh24i = V \u00d7 diag.(1, 1, 1, \u22123/2, \u22123/2). The doublet and triplet masses from this superpotential\nare then mD = M5 \u2212 (3/2)\u03bbV and mT = M5 + \u03bbV respectively. If both M5 and V are of order\nthe GUT scale, the color triplet will have naturally mass of order the GUT scale. In order to\nmake the doublet mass at the weak scale a sever fine\u2013tuning between two large terms is done.\nThis fine\u2013tuning, which is present in other GUT groups as well, is an unattractive aspect of SUSY\nGUTs.\nSeveral mechanisms have been suggested in the literature for solving of the doublet\u2013triplet splitting problem without fine\u2013tuning. In SU(5), the missing partner mechanism [3] (briefly reviewed\nin the next section) can be employed to avoid the fine\u2013tuning. Here one makes use of 50 + 50 Higgs\nfields which have the feature that they contain color triplets, but no weak doublets. One pairs\n\n2\n\n\fup the colored higgses from the 5 + 5 with those from the 50 + 50. Such a pairing will leave the\ndoublets naturally light. The stability of such a solution against higher order operators requires\nsome additional effort [4].\nIn SU(6) grand unified theories, the pseudo\u2013Goldstone mechanism [5, 6] can solve the DT\nsplitting problem rather elegantly. Here the Higgs doublets are identified as pseudo\u2013Goldstone\nbosons of a larger global symmetry. The gauge symmetry should be augmented by additional\nsymmetries for this realization. The anomalous U(1) symmetry of string origin is very efficient for\nthis purpose [6].\nIn this paper we are concerned with grand unified theories based on SUSY SO(10), which are\nparticularly attractive [7]. The spinor representation of SO(10) unifies all matter fermions of a\ngiven family in a single multiplet \u2013 a feat not achieved in SU(5) or SU(6) GUT. The spinor of\nSO(10) contains also the right handed neutrino (\u03bdR ), which can generate light neutrino masses via\nsee-saw mechanism [8]. The \u03bdR can also naturally account for the baryon asymmetry of the Universe\nvia leptogenesis [9]. Another nice property of SO(10)\u2013based GUT is that, they can automatically\nlead to matter parity (or R\u2013parity) [10] which is usually assumed as an ad hoc symmetry in the\nMSSM. Such a symmetry is needed in order to avoid rapid proton decay, it also provides a natural\ncold dark matter candidate. In SUSY SO(10), matter parity can be automatic since it contains\nB \u2212 L as a subgroup.\nThe most widely discussed approach to the DT splitting problem in SO(10) is the Dimopoulous\u2013\nWilczek mechanism, or the missing VEV mechanism [11]. Here one employs an adjoint 45\u2013plet of\nHiggs field with its vacuum expectation value pointing in the B \u2212 L conserving direction: h45i =\nV \u00d7 diag(1, 1, 1, 0, 0) \u2297 i\u03c42 . The MSSM Higgs doublets are contained in 10 of SO(10) (10 = 5 + 5\nunder SU(5)). If the superpotential contains the terms W \u2283 M10 10\u2032 10\u2032 + \u03bb 10 * 10\u2032 * 45, because\nof the VEV structure of 45, the color triplets from 10, 10\u2032 will acquire GUT scale masses, while\na doublet pair from 10 will remain massless. Note that this is done without fine\u2013tuning, and is\nfacilitated by the fact that the adjoint of SO(10) is not a traceless matrix, unlike the adjoint of\nSU(N) groups. A variety of realistic models based on this mechanism have been constructed in\nthe literature [12]. Additional ingredients are usually needed to guarantee the stability of the VEV\nstructure of 45 [13, 14]. Realistic models for fermion masses including neutrino oscillations have\nbeen constructed based on this mechanism [15].\nAlthough SO(10)\u2013based model building has attracted considerable attention, to date, the missing partner mechanism that works in SUSY SU(5) has not been successfully implemented in SO(10).\nThe purpose of this paper is provide such a realization. We present examples of models with all\norder stability of the DT hierarchy which also have realistic phenomenology.\nIn the next sections, first we point out the possibility and some properties of a missing doublet\nSO(10) scenario and draw the ingredients needed for realistic model building. Then we present\nexplicit models which provide all order stability of the proposed DT splitting mechanism. Then we\n3\n\n\fshow how realistic fermion masses can be generated in this context. Finally we comment on the\nperturbativity of the gauge coupling above the GUT scale.\n\n2\n\nMissing Partner Mechanism in SO(10)\n\nFirst let us recall how the missing partner mechanism, or missing doublet (MD) mechanism, works\nwithin SUSY SU(5) GUT. Then, the steps needed for building a missing doublet SO(10) (MDSO10)\nGUT will be easier to follow. In SUSY SU(5), the pair of the MSSM Higgs doublets hu and hd\nare embedded in the supermultiplets h(5) and h\u0304(5\u0304) respectively. The composition of these states\nare h = hu + Th , h\u0304 = hd + T\u0304h , where T, T\u0304 are color triplets. The 50 + 50 representations of\nSU(5) (which we denote as \u03c8 + \u03c8\u0304) have the curious feature that they contain states with the\nsame quantum numbers as Th and T\u0304h , but not the hu , hd states [16]. Thus arranging suitable\ncouplings between h, h\u0304 and \u03c8, \u03c8 one can decouple the triplets Th , T\u0304h from 5 + 5 through the mixing\nwith T\u03c8 , T\u0304\u03c8 [3]. For this to be achieved, a scalar \u03c6(75)-plet must be introduced with non\u2013zero\nSU(5) \u2192 SU(3)c \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y breaking VEV. The relevant superpotential couplings are\nW \u2283 \u03c6h\u03c8 + \u03c6h\u0304\u03c8 + M\u03c8 \u03c8\u03c8 .\n\n(1)\n\nAfter substituting the VEV h\u03c6i \u223c V\u03c6 , the color triplet mass matrix will be\nT\u0304h\nTh \uf8ec 0\n\uf8eb\n\nT\u03c8\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\nV\u03c6\n\nT\u0304\u03c8 \uf8f6\nV\u03c6 \uf8f7\n\nM\u03c8\n\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f8\n\n(2)\n\nand therefore with M\u03c8 \u223c V\u03c6 \u223c MGUT one expects all triplet masses to be near the scale MGUT . At\nthis level the doublets from 5 + 5 are massless since there are no doublets in the 50 + 50. Crucial\nfor this mechanism is the omission of the mass term Mh h\u0304h. Of course, this must be justified and\nadditional symmetries can be employed for this purpose [4].\nNow we turn to models based on SO(10) gauge symmetry and try to see how the missing\npartner mechanism can be realized. The lowest dimensional Higgs representations which has a\nmissing doublet in SO(10) is the 126 + 126. They contain SU(5) 50 + 50-plets. Indeed, in terms of\nSU(5) \u00d7 U(1) \u2261 G51 (one of the maximal subgroups of SO(10)) we have [16]\n126 = 1\u221210 + 5\u0304\u22122 + 10\u22126 + 156 + 452 + 50\u22122 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the subscripts stand for U(1) charges. This representation, together with 126, will be used\nfor building MDSO10 model. The MSSM Higgs doublets are embedded (at least partially) in the\nscalar H(10)-plet of SO(10). This is the lowest representation which admits renormalizable Yukawa\ncouplings - 16 * 16 H(10). So, for DT splitting we should arrange the coupling of H with 126-plets.\n4\n\n\fTo do this at the renormalizable level we need to introduce a scalar supermultiplet in the 210\nrepresentation of SO(10). Note that it is quite exciting that the multiplets 126 + 126 + 210, which\nwe just mentioned, have been used extensively recently for building renormalizable SO(10) GUT\n[17, 18] with some predictive power in the fermion sector, including neutrino oscillations.\nHere we will show the importance of these states in achieving the DT splitting. The couplings\nof the bi-linears 126 H(10) and 126 H(10) with 210-plet form SO(10) singlets and will be used\nbelow. However, we note that some caution is needed for building self\u2013consistent model. From Eq.\n(3) we see that the 126, 126-plets contain, besides the 50-plets, 5 and 45-plets. The latter states\ncontain color triplets as well as weak doublets. Thus there is danger that together with color triplets\nof H(10) the doublets also gain large masses. However, if we introduce a set of Higgs superfields\ncontaining in total three pair of weak doublets, it is clear by a simple counting of degrees of freedom\nthat, only two pair of doublets will get masses by mixing with 5 and 45-plets from the 126, 126.\nNow, one must decide which additional states are most convenient for this purpose together with\none H(10) supermultiplet. It turns out that the state \u03a3(120) can do a very useful job in this regard.\nThe decomposition of 120 in terms of G51 reads\n120 = 52 + 5\u0304\u22122 + 10\u22126 + 106 + 452 + 45\u22122 .\n\n(4)\n\nThe multiplets H(10) and \u03a3(120) together contain three pairs of doublets and three triplet \u0304\nantitriplet pairs. To be more clear, let us consider the multiplets H(10), \u03a3(120), \u2206(126), \u2206(126),\n\u03a6(210)\nand the superpotential couplings\n \u0304\n \u0304 .\n\u03a6\u2206(H + \u03a3) + \u03a6\u2206(H\n+ \u03a3) + M\u2206 \u2206\u2206\n\n(5)\n\n \u0304 = 0 and the VEV of \u03a6 in the most general direction that preserves the SM\nWith h\u2206i = h\u2206i\ngauge symmetry (see next section for more details) the mass matrices for triplet and doublet states\nschematically are given by\nT\u0304H,\u03a3\nMT =\n\nMD =\n\n\uf8eb\n\nTH,\u03a3 \uf8ec 03\u00d73\nT\u2206\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\nh\u03a6i3\u00d73\n\nD\u0304H,\u03a3\nDH,\u03a3 \uf8ec 03\u00d73\n\uf8eb\n\nD\u2206\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\nh\u03a6i2\u00d73\n\nT\u0304\u2206\n\uf8f6\n\nh\u03a6i3\u00d73 \uf8f7\n\n(M\u2206 )3\u00d73\n\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f8\n\nD\u0304\u2206\n\uf8f6\nh\u03a6i3\u00d72 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n(M\u2206 )2\u00d72 \uf8f8\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the dimensions of the block matrices have been denoted appropriately by subscripts. The\ndimension of the doublet mass matrix is by one unit less than the dimension of the triplet mass\nmatrix, because there is one missing doublet pair (in states 50\u2206 \u0304 +50\u2206 ). Considering now the matrix\n5\n\n\fEq. (6), we can see that all triplets from H, \u03a3-plets gain masses through the mixings with the three\n \u0304\nHowever, according to Eq. (7), two doublet\ntriplet\u2013antitriplet pairs from \u2206(126) + \u2206(126)-plets.\n \u0304\npairs from \u2206(126) + \u2206(126)\ngenerate masses for two doublet pairs from H, \u03a3 states. Therefore, the\nthird pair of doublets coming from H, \u03a3 will remain massless. (This is also obvious from the fact\nthat Det(MD ) = 0). The reason is simple: as already was mentioned, there is one missing pair of\n \u0304\ndoublet in \u2206(126) + \u2206(126).\nThis is a transparent demonstration how the missing partner mechanism can work in SO(10).\nHowever, for realistic model building some more elaboration will be required. Namely, one should\nmake sure that the couplings H 2 , \u03a32 , \u03a6H\u03a3 are absent, i.e. the zero of the 3 \u00d7 3 block in Eq. (7)\nmust be guaranteed. Although the supersymmetric non-renormalization theorem guarantees that\nonce set to zero these terms will not be generated perturbatively, we wish to explain the origin of\ntheir absence based on some symmetries. In addition, we wish to insure that certain higher order\nnon-renormalizable operators which may be induced by unknown Planck scale effects are absent.\n \u0304 to be\nAlso, in order the for the DT hierarchy to remain intact we need the VEV of either \u2206 or \u2206\nzero. In the next section we present explicit SO(10) model(s) which address all these issues and\nshow the consistency of the mechanism.\nBefore closing this section, let us mention that besides the triplet and doublet states \u03a3(120)-plet\ncontain other vector like states. All of these extra states will acquire masses through the mixings\n \u0304\nwith \u2206(126), \u2206(126)\nmultiplets. Note that the quantum numbers of all the fragments of \u03a3(120)-plet\n \u0304 [see Eq. (3) and Eq. (4)]. Therefore, no state (besides\nmatch with those of the states from \u2206, \u2206\nthe one massless doublet which partially also resides in H) from \u03a3 remains massless.\n\n3\n\nExplicit Missing Doublet SO(10) Models\n\nFrom the discussions of the previous section we already got a clear idea of what field content we\nwould need in order to realize the missing doublet mechanism in SO(10). As it will turn out, it\nis much more convenient if the 126-plets involved in the DT splitting have no VEVs (or at least\n \u0304\nhas no VEV). Thus, the symmetry breaking sector should be\none, out of \u2206(126) and \u2206(126)-plets,\ndiscussed is some detail. For the rank breaking of SO(10) we can use either a scalar 16 + 16-plets\nor another 126 + 126-plets. In either case we denote the rank breaking superfields by C, C\u0304 and\ndistinguish between two possible cases:\n(a) :\n\nC = 16 ,\n\nC\u0304 = 16 ,\n\nand\n\n(b) :\n\nC = 126 ,\n\nC\u0304 = 126 .\n\n(8)\n\nThe states C, C\u0304 together with \u03a6(210)-plet break the SO(10) group down to SU(3)c \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7\nU(1)Y . This discussion concludes the selection of the GUT scalar superfields.\nWe wish to build models which preserves DT splitting to all order, i.e. all couplings (including\nnon\u2013renormalizable operators) allowed by symmetries must be taken into account. Thus, we will\n6\n\n\fTable 1: U(1) charges Q of the superfields. In case (a): C = 16, C\u0304 = 16.

As it turns out, this symmetry is anomalous. The anomalous U(1) symmetry\nof string origin has been applied in GUT model building [6, 4, 14] and has been shown to be\nvery efficient for stabilizing the DT splitting to all orders. Here we apply this U(1) symmetry\nin our MDSO10 scenario. The anomalous U(1) factors can appear in effective field theories from\nstring theory upon compactification to four dimensions. The apparent anomaly in this U(1) is\ncanceled through the Green-Schwarz mechanism [19]. Due to the anomaly, a Fayet-Iliopoulos term\nR\n\u2212\u03be d4 \u03b8VA is always generated [20] and the corresponding DA -term has the form [21]\n\n\u0011\nX\ngA2 MP2\ngA2 \u0010\ngA2 2\n2 2\n\u2212\u03be +\nQi |\u03c6i |\n, \u03be=\nD =\nTrQ ,\n(9)\n8 A\n8\n192\u03c0 2\nwhere Qi is the U(1) charge of \u03c6i superfield. For U(1) breaking we introduce an SO(10) singlet\nscalar superfield X with U(1) charge\nQX = 2. With \u03be > 0, in Eq. (9) the VEV of the scalar\nq\ncomponent of X is fixed as hXi = \u03be/2.\nIn Table 1 we list all scalar superfields introduced, the matter 16i -plets (i = 1, 2, 3) and the\ncorresponding U(1) charges. The fermion sector will be discussed at the end of this section. With\nthis assignment we can write down the superpotential couplings. The part which is important for\nDT splitting is\n \u0304 (H + \u03a3) + X \u2206\u2206\n \u0304 .\nWDT = \u03a6\u2206 (H + \u03a3) + \u03a6\u2206\n(10)\n\nIn order to carry the detailed analysis, we should first investigate the symmetry breaking and field\nVEV structure. The superpotential couplings important for the symmetry breaking are\n\u03bb 3 M\u03a6 2\n\u03a6 +\n\u03a6 + C\u0304C (MC + \u03c3\u03a6) .\n(11)\n3\n2\nAlso, there are higher order superpotential couplings (potentially induced by unknown gravity\neffects) with '\u2206 \u2212 C mixing':\nW (\u03a6, C) =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\nW (\u2206, C) = \uf8f3\n\n2\nX 2 \u2206C\u0304 C\u0304/MPl\n,\n2\nX \u2206C\u0304/MPl ,\n\n7\n\nfor case (a)\nfor case (b)\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\n\fThus, the total symmetry breaking superpotential is\nWSB = W (\u03a6, C) + W (\u2206, C) .\n\n(13)\n\nIn terms of SU(5) group, \u03a6(210) decomposes as\n\u03a6(210) = 1\u03a6 + 24\u03a6 + 75\u03a6 + * * *\n\n(14)\n\nwhere the dots stand for states which have no SU(3)c \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y singlet components.

We also have \u2206\nand all the F and the D-terms vanish, ensuring unbroken supersymmetry. It is important that\nthe operators H 2 , \u03a32 , \u03a6H\u03a3 are forbidden by U(1) symmetry. U(1) invariance would require that\nthese operators should be multiplied by some field combinations carrying negative U(1) charge.\nWe can readily check that such operator will involve \u2206 and since h\u2206i = 0 they are not relevant.\nTherefore, quadratic couplings with respect to H, \u03a3 will not give rise to the doublet masses to all\norders. There will be additional operators which are linear with respect to H and \u03a3:\nOH H + O\u03a3 \u03a3 .\n\n(21)\n\nThe SO(10) \u00d7 U(1) symmetry determines their structure and for the two cases (a) and (b) we have\n(a) :\n\nOH = \u2206C\u0304 2 C 2 + X C\u0304 2 ,\n\nO\u03a3 = \u2206C\u0304 2 C 2 + X\u03a6C\u0304 2 ,\n\n(b) :\n\nOH = \u2206\u03a6C\u0304C + X\u03a6C\u0304 ,\n\nO\u03a3 = \u2206\u03a6C\u0304C + X\u03a6C\u0304 ,\n\n(22)\n\n(cut off scale is ommited).

(29). For example MF,T \u2243 MF and for \u03a9T , \u03a9\u0304T one should take into account\nsome GUT Clebsch factors. These factors do not play any role in our analysis. It is important that\nthe triplet 3 \u00d7 3 mass matrix is generated and all the triplets acquire masses. The situation differs\nfor the doublet fragments. Since the 50-plets do not include the doublets, the appropriate MF,D ,\n\u03a9D and \u03a9\u0304D matrices will have dimensions 2 \u00d7 2, 3 \u00d7 2 and 2 \u00d7 3 respectively. Up to some irrelevant\nClebsch factors its structure is\n\n\u03a9D \u221d\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\u03a61 + \u03a624\n\n\u03a624 + \u03a675\n\n\u03a61 + \u03a624\n\n\u03a624 + \u03a675\n\n\u03a624 + \u03a675\n\n\u03a61 + \u03a624 + \u03a675\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n\u03a9\u0304D \u221d \u03a9D T ,\n\nMF,D \u2243 hXiDiag (1 , 1)\n\n(31)\n\nand the induced 3 \u00d7 3 doublet mass matrix is\nMD \u221d \u03a9D (MF,D )\u22121 \u03a9\u0304D .\n\n(32)\n\nClearly, due to the form of the matrices in Eq. (31), the matrix in Eq. (32) has one zero eigenvalue.\nThe reason is simple: this 3 \u00d7 3 mass matrix is effectively induced by integrating out two heavy\nstates (the matrix MF,D is of 2 \u00d7 2 dimension). Thus, one doublet pair is light, and should be\nidentified to the MSSM Higgs doublets. Once more we stress that this is a result in both (a) and\n(b) cases.\nLet us summarize the role of the anomalous U(1) symmetry used here. It forbids the renormalizable coupling H 2 , \u03a32 , \u03a6H\u03a3 which would contribute to the MSSM doublet mass. This U(1)\nsymmetry also guarantees that h\u2206i = 0. This is important because the combination \u2206\u2206 has\nnegative U(1) charge and the allowed operators such as \u2206\u2206 (H 2 + \u03a32 ), which might be induced\nby Planck scale physics, do not give rise to any contribution to the doublet mass. The condition\nh\u2206i = 0 also guarantees that there are no mixings between 5\u03a6 and 5H,\u03a3 , 45\u03a3 states (see Eq. (23))\nand thus the integration of heavy 5\u03a6 , 5\u03a6 -plets does not destroy the DT hierarchy.\nIn what follows, we discuss some details of the Yukawa sector of this model.\n\nYukawa Sector and Fermion Mass Generation\nNow we discuss the fermion sector of the model and show that the charge assignments given in\nTable 1 give a self\u2013consistent picture. For the matter 16i -plets (i = 1, 2, 3) we take the family\n11\n\n\fH, \u03a3\n\n\u03a6\n\n16h\n\n16h\n\n16j\n\n16i\n\nFigure 1: Diagram inducing operators of Eq.

Then the Yukawa couplings are\nX\u0012\n\nk=0\n\n\u03a6\nM\n\n\u0013k\n\n16i 16j H +\n\nX\u0012\n\nk=0\n\n\u03a6\nM\n\n\u0013k\n\n16i 16j \u03a3 ,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere M is some cut-off scale and can be taken close to MPl . Note that without using \u03a6 insertion,\nalthough both H(10) and \u03a3(120)-plets include light Higgs doublets, only renormalizable couplings\n16 * 16H and 16 * 16\u03a3 do not give desirable fermion mass pattern [22]. Thus, at least the first power\nof \u03a6 in one of the couplings of Eq. (33) is needed. Note that the operators \u03a616 * 16H, \u03a616 * 16\u03a3 can\nbe generated from renormalizable couplings through integrating some heavy states. For example,\nintroducing the heavy states 16h and 16h with U(1) charges \u22121/2 and 1/2, the relevant couplings\nare\n(34)\n(H + \u03a3)16 * 16h + \u03a616 * 16h + Mh 16h * 16h .\nIntegration of 16h , 16h states induces the effective operators\n\u03a6\n\u03a6\n16 * 16H +\n16 * 16\u03a3 .\nMh\nMh\n\n(35)\n\nThis is shown in Fig. 1.\nBesides the Yukawa coupling discussed above we need the operator which will generate Majorana\nmasses for the right handed neutrinos. For the case (a), the corresponding coupling is\nX2\n16i 16j C\u0304 C\u0304 .\nM\u22173\n\n(36)\n\nWe now discuss the possibility of generating such couplings from renormalizable interactions.

(36) is\ngenerated with M\u2217 \u223c (MN2 M0 )1/3 . This integrating\u2013out mechanism is shown in Fig. 2.\nFor case (b) the coupling for the Majorana neutrino mass can be from the operator\nX\n \u0304 .\n16i 16j \u2206\nM\u2217\n\n(38)\n\n \u0304 can have the VEV [see Eq. (17)] due the non-renormalizable coupling in Eq. (12).\nRecall that \u2206\nThe operator in Eq. (38) can also be generated from the renormalizable couplings. Introducing\n\u2032\nthree pairs of 16\u2032, 16 -plets with U(1) charges 3/2 and \u22123/2, the relevant superpotential terms are\n \u0304 \u2032 + X1616 + M\u2217 16\u2032 16 .\n16\u220616\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n(39)\n\nIntegration of 16\u2032 , 16 states leads to the operator in Eq. (38), with corresponding diagram in Fig.\n \u0304 has a non\u2013zero VEV. For this to happen, the\n3.a. Besides this, we have to make sure that \u2206\npresence of the operator in Eq. (12) [case (b)] is important. If we wish to not rely on unknown\nPlanck physics, these coupling can be generated by introducing the scalar superfields Y and \u0232 with\nU(1) charges 4 and \u22124 resp. With couplings C\u0304\u2206Y + X 2 \u0232 + MPl Y \u0232 , the integration of Y, \u0232 states\ninduce the operator (b) in Eq. (12). This is depicted in Fig. 3.b. Note that the additional field \u0232\nwith negative U(1) charge has no VEV and therefore is harmless for DT hierarchy.\nAs wee see, the presented missing doublet SO(10) model(s) is fully consistent with realistic\nfermion masses and mixings. The remarkable thing is that the whole scenario including the fermion\nsector can be constructed from renormalizable couplings.\n13\n\n\f\u2206\n\n\u2206\n\nX\n\n\u2032\n\n16\n\n16\u2032\n\n16i\n\n(a)\n\nX\n\nY\n\n16j\n\nC\n\nY\n\n(b)\n\nX\n\nFigure 3: Diagrams (a) and (b) generating operators of Eqs.

For this mechanism to be realized through renormalizable\nsuperpotential couplings we have considered the scalar superfield content 10 + 120 + 126 + 126 + 210\nand the SO(10) rank breaking states C, C\u0304. For the latter, two possibilities (a): C = 16, C\u0304 = 16\nand (b): C = 126, C\u0304 = 126 can be considered with equal success. Our scenario is consistent\nwith realistic fermion sector as well as with successful gauge coupling unification. Unification is\nachieved because below the GUT scale, the light fields are just those of the MSSM. One can also\naddress the issue of gauge coupling perturbativity above the GUT scale. In this respect, let us point\nout that the chance is not bad. For instance, in case (a), one can consider the SO(10) breaking\ndown to SU(5) at scale MSO(10) \u2243 hCi \u2243 hC\u0304i \u223c 1017 GeV. Below this scale, light scalar states\nwhich are needed are fragments from 10, 120 and 75 (from 210). Note that the states 126, 126\ncan have mass\u223c 1017 GeV and similar masses for the remaining fragments from 210 (apart from\nthe 75-plet). All these can be achieved by a (mild) fine\u2013tuning. Eventually, the VEV of 24-plet\n(from 210) is somewhat suppressed, but this does not change anything for the considered DT\nsplitting scenario. With this mass spectrum (including light fermion families), the SU(5) gauge\ncoupling interpolated from MSU (5) \u2243 2 * 1016 GeV up to the MSO(10) \u223c 1017 GeV is still perturbative\n\u03b1GUT (MSO(10) ) \u2243 1/12.5. Above the scale MSO(10) , all SO(10) states listed above should be included\nin the RGE study and one finds that the gauge coupling becomes strong near 1.7 * 1017 GeV. Thus,\nthis scale should be considered as a natural cut\u2013off of the theory. Of course, more detailed study\nwith accurate calculation of the mass spectrum is needed. Besides this question one should also\n\n14\n\n\faddress proton stability and the problem of fermion flavor (mass and mixing hierarchy) within this\nscenario.\nSince the mechanism which we have proposed opens up a wide playground for SO(10) model\nbuilding, we hope that our proposal will motivate others to address and investigate an array of\nissues which we have not attempted in this work.\nAcknowledgments\nDiscussions with S.
