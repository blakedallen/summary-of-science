The other ordered phase becomes metastable, separated from the basin of attraction of the stable\nphase by a free-energy barrier. If the system is initially prepared in the metastable phase and thermal fluctuations\nare present, the system eventually (possibly after an extremely long time) escapes from the metastable free-energy\nwell and approaches stable equilibrium. In the present paper we consider the response of a spatially extended , bistable\nsystem driven by an external field which is periodic in time. In particular, we focus on the finite-size effects of the\nperiodic system response.\nFerromagnets are perhaps the most commonly known systems that exhibit metastability and hysteresis. In this\npaper we therefore use magnetic language, in which the order parameter is the system magnetization m, and its\nconjugate field is the external magnetic field H. Analogous interpretations, e.g., using the terms \"polarization\" and\n\"electric field\" for ferroelectric systems, \"coverage\" and \"electrochemical potential\" for adsorbate systems, etc., are\nstraightforward [1].\nThe dynamic response under an oscillating external field can be viewed as a competition between two time scales:\nthe half-period t1/2 of the external field (proportional to the inverse driving frequency) and the average metastable\nlifetime h\u03c4 i of the system (the mean time spent in the metastable well) after a sudden field reversal. For low driving\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: korniss@rpi.edu\naddress: rikvold@csit.fsu.edu\n\u2021 Electronic address: man40@ra.msstate.edu\n\u2020 Electronic\n\n\ffrequencies, the time-dependent magnetization oscillates about zero in synchrony with the external field (symmetric\ndynamic phase). For high frequencies, however, the magnetization does not have time to switch sign during one\nhalf-period, and it oscillates about one or the other of its degenerate zero-field values (asymmetric dynamic phase).\nThis symmetry breaking and the corresponding dynamic phase transition (DPT) between the symmetric and the\nasymmetric limit cycles of the system magnetization have attracted considerable attention over the last decade. It\nwas first observed during numerical integration of the mean-field equation of motion for the magnetization of a\nferromagnet in an oscillating field [2, 3]. Since then it has been the focus of investigation in numerous Monte Carlo\nsimulations of kinetic Ising systems [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], further mean-field studies [5, 7, 8, 15, 16],\nand most recently in analytic studies of a bistable time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) model [17]. The DPT\nmay also have been experimentally observed in Co on Cu(001) ultrathin magnetic films [18, 19, 20] and recently in\nnumerical studies of fully frustrated Josephson-junction arrays [21] and anisotropic Heisenberg models [22]. The results\nof these studies agree that there exists a genuine continuous phase transition between the symmetric and asymmetric\ndynamic phases, at least in some region of the parameter space spanned by temperature, field, and half-period.\nFinite-size scaling studies of data from dynamic Monte Carlo simulations [1, 12, 14], as well as analytic arguments\n[17] have demonstrated that this far-from-equilibrium phase transition belongs to the same universality class as the\nequilibrium Ising model in zero field. This result is consistent with previous symmetry [23] and renormalization group\n[24] arguments [25].\nIn their original paper on the DPT in a mean-field model [2], Tom\u00e9 and de Oliveira reported that the continuous\n(second-order) phase transition observed at high temperatures appeared to change at a tricritical point (TCP) to a\ndiscontinuous (first-order) transition for low temperatures. Such a TCP was also reported in later mean-field work\n[5]. However, an analytical and numerical mean-field study by Zimmer [16] makes a strong case that the claims for\na TCP in the mean-field case is based on a misinterpretation of effects of critical slowing-down at the DPT. Similar\nclaims, that in some region of the dynamic phase diagram spatially extended kinetic Ising models exhibit a first-order\ntransition and consequently have a TCP separating lines of second-order and first-order dynamic phase transitions,\nhave also been made on the basis of dynamic Monte Carlo studies [9, 26, 27]. For recent reviews on the DPT, see\nRefs. [26, 27].\nThe purpose of the present paper is to clear up the remaining confusion about the interpretation of simulation\nresults for the DPT in spatially extended kinetic Ising models, in particular in the low-temperature regime where a\nfirst-order transition and a TCP have been claimed to exist [9, 26, 27]. Those conclusions were essentially based on\ndata for a single system size, and we here demonstrate how proper consideration of rather subtle finite-size effects\nleads to a different picture. The implication of our theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulations presented in\nthis paper is that in an infinitely large system a continuous DPT should persist down to arbitrarily low temperatures.\nHowever, in any finite system for sufficiently low frequencies, the DPT gives way to a transient regime of stochastic\nresonance (SR) [28] at a size-dependent temperature. It is this size-dependent crossover temperature, which has\npreviously been misinterpreted as a TCP.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we summarize the theoretical framework needed to\nunderstand the underlying metastable decay mechanisms and their consequences for the DPT. This underscores again\nthe importance of the interplay of various time- and length scales in metastable systems [1, 10, 11, 29, 30, 31]. In Sec. III\nwe extend our preliminary numerical work [32], supporting our theoretical arguments by large-scale Monte Carlo\nsimulations of a two-dimensional kinetic Ising ferromagnet in an oscillating field. Our conclusions are summarized in\nSec. IV, and derivations of analytic approximations for quantities of interest in the stochastic-resonance regime are\ngiven in Appendix A and Appendix B.\nII.\n\nMETASTABLE DECAY MODES AND PERIODIC RESPONSE IN FINITE SYSTEMS\n\nThe appropriate dynamic\norder parameter in the presence of an oscillating external field is the period-averaged\nH\n1\nmagnetization, Q= 2t1/2\nm(t)dt [2]. It takes a nonzero value in the asymmetric dynamic phase, while it vanishes in\nthe symmetric phase. The transition occurs when the half-period t1/2 and the underlying metastable lifetime h\u03c4 (T, H)i\nbecome comparable. The metastable lifetime depends on the temperature T and the field amplitude H. For sufficiently\nlarge systems (see quantitative statements below) the system escapes from the metastable phase through the nucleation\nof many droplets [multi-droplet (MD) regime [29, 30]]. Consequently, the time-dependent system magnetization is\nself-averaging. If h\u03c4 (T, H)i\u226at1/2 , the magnetization follows the external field in each half-period. The system relaxes\nto a symmetric limit cycle, and the order-parameter probability density P (Q) is sharply peaked about Q=0. On the\nother hand, for h\u03c4 (T, H)i\u226bt1/2 the magnetization does not have enough time to switch within a single half-period,\nand it relaxes to an asymmetric limit cycle (with occasional switches between the two equivalent asymmetric dynamic\nphases). Consequently, P (Q) becomes bimodal with sharp peaks near Q=\u00b11. This breaking of the symmetry of\nthe limit cycle and the associated DPT have been carefully analyzed [1, 12, 14] with finite-size scaling techniques\n2\n\n\fborrowed from equilibrium critical phenomena [33, 34]. In terms of the dimensionless half-period, \u0398\u2261t1/2 /h\u03c4 (T, H)i,\nthe DPT occurs at a critical value \u0398c \u223cO(1). The finite-size scaling analysis of the Monte Carlo data also indicates\nthat this far-from-equilibrium phase transition belongs to the same universality class as the equilibrium Ising model\nin zero field. Supporting these numerical studies, recent analytic results within a coarse-grained TDGL model [17]\nindicate that the behavior of the stochastic variable Q is governed by the effective Hamiltonian Heff =aQ2 + Q4 , where\na\u221d(\u0398 \u2212 \u0398c ). According to standard arguments from the theory of critical phenomena, this result leads directly to\nthe conclusion that the DPT belongs to the universality class of the zero-field Ising model in equilibrium [35], in\nagreement with the simulation results.\nFor any finite system, however, the metastable decay mode changes to the nucleation and growth of a single droplet\nat sufficiently low temperatures [single-droplet (SD) regime [29, 30]]. Due to the stochastic nature of the nucleation\nof a single droplet, the corresponding response in the presence of an oscillating field is different: the system exhibits\n[9, 11, 31] stochastic resonance [28].\nThe crossover from the underlying MD to SD decay can be understood by using standard nucleation theory applied\nto the ferromagnetic kinetic Ising model (in general dimension d and with ferromagnetic coupling constant J) [29, 30].\nBelow the critical temperature, following a single, instantaneous field reversal, the average time between nucleation\nevents (the nucleation time) in a system of linear size L is obtained as\n\u0002\n\u0003\u22121\ntn = Ld I(T, H)\n,\n\n(1)\n\nI(T, H) = C(T, H)\u22121 e\u2212F (T,H)/T ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere I(T, H) is the temperature- and field-dependent nucleation rate per unit volume. It can be expressed in terms\nof the free energy F (T, H) of the critical droplet as\n\nwhere F (T, H) and the prefactor C(T, H) can be obtained from nucleation theory to various degrees of approximation,\ndepending on T and H [30]. The temperature T is given in energy units by setting the Boltzmann constant kB =1 in\nEq. (2). The other characteristic time scale is the growth time tg . It is defined as the time it takes for a supercritical\ndroplet to grow to fill half the system volume. Assuming a time-independent radial growth velocity v(T, H),\ntg (L, T, H) =\n\nL\n,\n[2\u03a9d (T )]1/d v(T, H)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03a9d (T ) is a dimension- and temperature-dependent shape factor (between \u03c0 and 4 for d=2 and between 4\u03c0/3\nand 8 for d=3) [30].\nFor tn \u226atg many droplets nucleate while those nucleated shortly after the field reversal are still growing. In this,\nthe MD, regime the lifetime is independent of the system size. An order-of-magnitude estimate of the metastable\nlifetime h\u03c4 (T, H)i can be obtained [30] by equating the volume R0d reached by a droplet that grows for this amount\nof time, R0d \u221d(vh\u03c4 i)d , with the volume inside which on average a single nucleation event occurs during the same time,\nR0d \u221d(h\u03c4 iI)\u22121 (R0 can be regarded as the typical droplet separation). The result is h\u03c4 i \u221d (v d I)\u22121/(d+1) .\nFor tn \u226btg the first droplet to nucleate eventually fills the system on its own. In this regime the lifetime depends\nstrongly on the system size and approximately equals tn [Eq. (1)].\nThe above two decay modes characterize the MD and SD regime, respectively. The crossover between the two\nregimes defines the dynamic spinodal (DSP) [30] and can be estimated by equating tn and tg . (In terms of the\nunderlying length scales, this corresponds to the situation in which the mean droplet separation R0 = vh\u03c4 i becomes\ncomparable to the system size L.) This yields an implicit equation for the temperature corresponding to the DSP as\na function L and H,\nTDSP =\n\nF (TDSP , H)\n.\n(d + 1) ln L \u2212 ln{C(TDSP , H)[2\u03a9d (TDSP )]1/d v(TDSP , H)}\n\n(4)\n\nFor d=2, analytic approximations [36] are known for v(T, H) [37], \u03a92 (T ), and C(T, H) [38, 39]. The corresponding\nestimate for TDSP as a function of L at H = 2.0J, obtained by numerically solving Eq. (4), is shown as a dashed\ncurve in Fig. 1. The resulting curve TDSP (L) turns out to be quite insensitive for the precise values used in the\napproximation [36]. In the large-system limit TDSP approaches zero logarithmically with increasing L. The existence\nof the DSP implies that in the presence of an oscillating field, reducing T at fixed half-period t1/2 and field amplitude\nH results in drastically different behaviors for \"small\" and \"large\" systems.\nUpon reducing the temperature for sufficiently large L, the L-independent metastable lifetime h\u03c4 (T, H)i becomes\ncomparable to the fixed half-period t1/2 at a temperature above the one at which the underlying decay mode would\ncross over to the SD mode.

The dashed curve is the dynamic spinodal (DSP) TDSP (L), separating\nthe underlying multi-droplet (MD) from the single-droplet (SD) regime. The solid curves correspond to T\u00d7 (L) [Eq. (6)], the\ncrossover to the dynamic \"frozen\" state for various half-periods t1/2 , indicated by arrows [in units of Monte Carlo steps per\nspin (MCSS)]. The horizontal dotted line indicates the temperature T =0.216J, at which the dynamic phase transition (DPT)\n3\noccurs in the large system-size limit for t1/2 =500 MCSS. Along this horizontal line, for L>\n\u223cO(10 ) the metastable lifetime is\nsystem-size independent, and its value is comparable to the fixed half-period.\n\n500 MCSS. Near this line, the system exhibits a continuous DPT [1, 12, 14]. Further lowering the temperature has no\neffect on the behavior of the dynamic order parameter Q, since the system is already locked into one of its symmetrybroken dynamic phases, where P (Q) is sharply peaked near \u00b11. From Fig. 1 it is clear that, in order to observe the\n3\nDPT in a finite system for a given value of t1/2 , one has to employ a sufficiently large system [e.g., L>\n\u223cO(10 ) for\n2\n>\nt1/2 =500 MCSS or L\u223cO(10 ) for t1/2 =50 MCSS]. In general, the larger t1/2 is, the larger systems one needs in order\nto observe the L\u2192\u221e behavior. This example illustrates that it is essential to keep in mind the finite-size implications\nof the crossover between the MD and SD decay mechanisms.\nUpon reducing the temperature for smaller L, the crossover from the MD to the SD regime occurs at a temperature\nwell above that at which the infinite-system DPT would occur. In the SD regime the switching is stochastic [30].\nThe system will then exhibit stochastic resonance, and the order-parameter distribution P (Q) will indeed possess\nmultiple peaks, leading to a negative fourth-order cumulant [9]. Lowering the temperature still further reduces the\nprobability that the magnetization switches during a finite number of periods, and the system becomes effectively\n\"frozen.\" The crossover to this frozen phase is approximately marked by the curve along which the probability is 1/2\nthat the magnetization does not switch during a half-period in which it is opposite to the direction of the field. This\ncrossover curve can be estimated by noting that SD switching is brought about by the nucleation of a single droplet,\nwhich is a Poisson process. Thus, the probability that the magnetization does not change sign during a half-period\nin which it started off opposite to the field is\n\u001a\n\b \u0002\n\u0003\nexp \u2212 t1/2 \u2212 tg (L, T, H) /tn (L, T, H) for tg \u2264 t1/2\nPnot (t1/2 ; L, T, H) =\n.\n(5)\n1\nfor tg > t1/2\nSetting Pnot = 1/2 leads again to an implicit equation for the corresponding crossover temperature,\nT\u00d7 =\n\nF (T\u00d7 , H)\n\u0011i .\n\u0010\n1\nL\nd ln L + ln C(T\u00d7 ,H)\nln 2 t1/2 \u2212 [2\u03a9d (T\u00d7 )]1/d v(T\u00d7 ,H)\nh\n\n(6)\n\nEstimates of T\u00d7 at H=2.0J for three different values of t1/2 , obtained by numerically solving Eq. (6) [36], are shown\nin Fig. 1 as solid curves. Since Pnot changes rapidly between zero and unity as T is reduced, the specific cut-off value\nof Pnot = 1/2, used to define T\u00d7 here, is not essential. For each value of t1/2 , the curves representing TDSP and T\u00d7\nform the border of a wedge-shaped region in which SR is observed (see Fig. 1). This is the regime where the dynamic\norder parameter is indeed characterized by a multi-peaked probability density and a negative fourth-order cumulant\n[9]. However, the above theoretical arguments imply that the SR behavior is a finite-size effect. We therefore conclude\nthat the otherwise sound simulation results that Acharyya obtained in the stochastic regime [9], were misinterpreted\nby him as signs of a first-order DPT.\n4\n\n\fTo summarize the periodic response for the ferromagnetic Ising model, for an infinite (or sufficiently large) system,\nthe system undergoes a continuous DPT when the the half-period becomes comparable with the metastable lifetime.\nCrossing the dynamic phase boundary (Fig. 1) by changing the temperature, for fixed and low frequencies (long halfperiods), the metastable lifetime becomes comparable to the half-period at appropriately low temperatures, thus the\nDPT occurs at a low temperature (horizontal dotted line in Fig. 1). For finite and too small systems, however, the\nunderlying decay mode crosses over to the SD regime before the DPT occurs (crossing the dashed curve from above\nin Fig. 1). Then the system exhibits SR in the wedge-shape region, until practically no switching occurs during any\nfinite observation time (frozen state). As we show next, careful analysis of simulation results for systems of different\nsizes reveals that the signatures attributed to a first-order DPT in Ref. [9] indeed disappear in the L\u2192\u221e limit, as\npredicted by the theoretical arguments presented above.\nIII.\n\nSIMULATION RESULTS AND FINITE-SIZE EFFECTS\n\nTo model spatially extended bistable systems we performed dynamic Monte Carlo simulations of a two-dimensional\nkinetic Ising ferromagnet below its equilibrium critical temperature. This simple model has, for example, been shown\nto be appropriate for describing magnetization dynamics in highly anisotropic single-domain nanoparticles and uniaxial\nthin films [18, 19, 20, 40]. Despite its simplicity, it is believed to capture the generic features of periodically driven,\nspatially extended bistable systems. The system, which is defined on a two-dimensional square lattice of linear size\nL, is described by the Hamiltonian\n2\n\nH = \u2212J\n\nX\n\nsi sj \u2212 H(t)\n\nL\nX\n\nsi ,\n\n(7)\n\ni=1\n\nhi,ji\n\nP\nwhere si =\u00b11 is the state of the ith spin, J>0 is the ferromagnetic coupling constant, hi,ji runs over all nearestneighbor pairs, and H(t) is an oscillating, spatially uniform applied field. We use a square-wave field with amplitude H.\nThis has obvious computational advantages over a sinusoidal field, while it does not change the universal characteristics\nof the system response [14]. The dynamic used is the single-spin-flip Glauber algorithm with updates at randomly\nchosen sites [33, 41]. At temperature T , each attempted spin flip from si to \u2212si is accepted with probability\nW (si \u2192 \u2212si ) =\n\ne\u2212\u2206Ei /T\n,\n1 + e\u2212\u2206Ei /T\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u2206Ei is the energy change that would result from the accepted flip. We give the temperature T in energy units\nby setting the Boltzmann constant kB =1 in Eq. (8). For the largest system sizes (L\u22651024) we implemented a scalable\nmassively parallel version of this dynamic [42, 43], first proposed by Lubachevsky [44].\nThe dynamic order parameter [2] is the period-averaged magnetization\nI\n1\nQ=\nm(t)dt ,\n(9)\n2t1/2\nP\nwhere m(t) = L\u22122 i si (t). The beginning of the period is chosen at a time when H(t) changes sign. In particular, we\ncompute both types of period averages, staring at the instant when H(t) changes from +H to \u2212H, and also starting\nwhen it changes from \u2212H to +H. Both observations are included in the order-parameter histograms with equal\nweight. This simplest form of phase averaging is sufficient to produce a symmetric distribution for Q, in particular in\nthe stochastic regime.\nLarge-scale simulations and finite-size scaling studies of the DPT have been recently performed with both sinusoidal\n[1, 12] and square-wave [14] fields. The results imply that the system undergoes a continuous phase transition as the\nhalf-period t1/2 becomes comparable to the average metastable lifetime h\u03c4 (T, H)i. Recall that the lifetime becomes\nindependent of the system size for large systems. The critical exponents for the dynamic order parameter and its\nfluctuations at the DPT are consistent with those of the two-dimensional equilibrium Ising transition [1, 12, 14, 17].\nIn those studies, the temperature and the field amplitude were held fixed, resulting in a fixed lifetime h\u03c4 (T, H)i. The\nDPT was approached by tuning the half-period t1/2 of the oscillating field so that it became comparable to h\u03c4 (T, H)i.\nAn advantage of this approach is that if the smallest system is already in the MD regime, all the larger ones are, as\nwell. Thus, one does not have to deal with subtle crossovers corresponding to the different underlying decay modes\n(SD vs MD). In the present study, we keep t1/2 fixed and tune the metastable lifetime by varying the temperature\nT . The motivation for this is to closely parallel the study by Acharyya [9], and to show that ignoring the finite-size\neffects and the resulting crossovers, one can easily misinterpret the stochastic-resonance behavior in the stochastic\nregime as indicating a first-order transition.\n5\n\n\f(a)\n\n0.0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0.0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n\u22121.0\n9000\n\n0.5\n\nt\n\n10000\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n\u22121.0\n9500\n\n(c)\n\n1.0\n\nm(t), H(t)/H\n\n0.5\n\n(b)\n\n1.0\n\nm(t), H(t)/H\n\nm(t), H(t)/H\n\n1.0\n\n\u22121.0\n\n9000\n\n9500\n\nt\n\n10000\n\n9000\n\n9500\n\nt\n\n10000\n\nFIG. 2: Magnetization time series m(t) (solid curves) and normalized applied field H(t)/H (dashed curves) with H=2.0J and\nt1/2 = 50 MCSS, shown for a \"small\" system with L=16 at different temperatures. (a) T =0.8J, dynamically disordered phase.\n(b) T =0.4J, stochastic resonance. (c) T =0.35J, dynamically \"frozen\" state.\n\nTracing the magnetization time series m(t) already reflects the major qualitative differences between the responses\nfor \"small\" and \"large\" systems, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. For sufficiently small L, as the temperature\nis reduced, the system enters the stochastic regime, characterized by occasional random switches [Fig. 2(b)], before\nbecoming completely \"frozen\" [Fig. 2(c)]. For large L, the system undergoes a DPT characterized by the slow\nwandering of the period-averaged magnetization [Fig. 3(b)] on its way to performing an asymmetric limit cycle in the\ndynamically ordered phase at still lower temperatures [Fig. 3(c)].\nWe performed simulations on system sizes ranging from L=16 to 2048, choosing various field amplitudes H and\nhalf-periods t1/2 that were kept fixed while the temperature T was varied. The time unit used is one Monte Carlo\nstep per spin [MCSS], i.e., one random \"sweep\" of the L\u00d7L lattice. The lengths of the runs were 103 full periods of\nthe oscillating field for t1/2 = 500 MCSS and 104 full periods for all the other values of t1/2 . Measuring the periodaveraged magnetization Q after each half-period, we constructed averages of the norm of the order parameter, h|Q|iL .\nWe further calculated the fourth-order cumulant ratio,\nUL = 1 \u2212\n\nhQ4 iL\n,\n3hQ2 i2L\n\n(10)\n\nwhich typically provides a strong indication of the nature of any underlying phase transition [33]. For a continuous\ntransition, UL changes monotonically from 0 to 2/3 as one tunes the system from the symmetric (disordered) to the\nsymmetry-broken (ordered) phase. On the other hand, for a first-order transition, UL develops a minimum, whose\nlocation corresponds to the transition point. We also constructed histograms of Q, representing the order-parameter\ndistribution P (Q). In the stochastic regime, we in addition measured the residence times tr and constructed their\nprobability distribution Pr (tr ), the residence-time distribution (rtd). Here tr is defined as the time spent in one of\nthe two \"wells\" of the underlying system free energy between two consecutive switching events. It is measured as the\ntime elapsed between two consecutive zero-crossings of m(t). The residence times and their distribution are useful to\ncharacterize the system in the stochastic SD regime.\nKeeping H and t1/2 fixed, we performed simulations measuring h|Q|i and UL as functions of T for a series of system\nsizes. Here we present the results for four different pairs of values of H and t1/2 . Figures 4, 5, 6, and 7 show the\nresults for H=2.0J and t1/2 =50 MCSS, H=2.0J and t1/2 =500 MCSS, H=1.8J and t1/2 =20 MCSS, and for H=3.0J\nand t1/2 =20 MCSS, respectively. As indicated by these figures, the findings in all these cases are qualitatively the\nsame. For the purpose of discussion, we use Fig. 4, corresponding to H=2.0J and t1/2 =50 MCSS.\nA.\n\nSmall systems\n\nEven for relatively small systems, L=16\u2013128, at sufficiently high temperatures the underlying metastable decay\nmode is MD, as illustrated in the phase diagram in Fig. 4(a). Then the system magnetization m(t) follows a symmetric\nlimit cycle [see Fig. 2(a)]. Consequently, the order-parameter distribution P (Q) is sharply peaked about zero [Fig 8(a)],\nyielding h|Q|iL \u223c0 up to finite-size effects, as shown in Fig. 4(b). Correspondingly, the fourth-order cumulant UL is\nclose to 0, as shown in Fig 4(c).\nAs the temperature is lowered beneath TDSP (L), the underlying decay mode crosses over to the SD regime, and the\nmagnetization switching becomes stochastic as shown in Fig. 2(b).

Note that the dip to\nnegative values disappears with increasing L.\n\npeaks: two extremely narrow peaks near Q=\u00b11 and a rather wide one centered at Q=0 [see Fig. 8(b) and (c)]. The\npeaks near \u00b11 represent the periods during which the magnetization does not switch, while the peak centered on zero\nrepresents the periods during which it switches at least once. The large width of this central peak is the result of the\nsquare-wave shape of the applied field, which results in an exponential probability density for the switching process.\nA sinusoidal field would yield a distribution more sharply peaked about zero, since, in that case, the switching almost\nalways occurs when the external field assumes its maximum magnitude [9, 10, 11, 31]. The generic feature in the\nstochastic regime, regardless of the shape of the driving field, is the multiple-peak structure. For the square-wave field\nused in this paper one can obtain (see Appendix A) an analytic approximation for P (Q) in the regime where t1/2 \u226btg\n[Fig. 10(a)]\nP (Q) =\n\ne\u2212\u0398\n\u0398\ne\u2212\u0398\n\u03b4(Q + 1) + e\u2212\u0398|Q| +\n\u03b4(Q \u2212 1) .\n2\n2\n2\n\n(11)\n\nEquation (11) for P (Q) is compared with simulation data in Fig. 10(b) for a system with L=32 at H=2.0J and\nT =0.34J, for which h\u03c4 (T, H)iL =233 MCSS. (The subscript L in h\u03c4 (T, H)iL is included as a reminder that the\nmetastable lifetime depends on L in the SD regime.) The half-period is t1/2 =500 MCSS \u226b tg . This comparison\ncontains no fitting parameters: the average metastable lifetime of the underlying metastable decay, h\u03c4 (T, H)iL , was\nmeasured in single field-reversal simulations, and its value was used to determine the scaled half-period, \u0398=t1/2 /h\u03c4 i.\nInstead of the delta-functions with amplitude e\u2212\u0398 /2, the finite value e\u2212\u0398 /(2\u2206Q) was used to make the correspondence\nwith the finite bin-size \u2206Q, employed to build the histogram for Q.

This quantity is shown in Fig. 11 for a system\nwith L=32 at H=2.0J and T =0.34J, for which h\u03c4 (T, H)iL =233 MCSS. The half-period is t1/2 =500 MCSS \u226b tg .\nThe data are shown together with an analytic approximation (t1/2 \u226btg ), which is derived in Appendix B\n\uf8f1\ni\nh\n\uf8f2 sinh tr \u2212 2(n \u2212 1)\u0398 if 2(n \u2212 1)t1/2 < tr < (2n \u2212 1)t1/2\n1 e\u2212n\u0398\nh\u03c4\ni\ni\nh\n.\n(12)\n\u00d7\nPr (tr ) =\nh\u03c4 i 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u0398 \uf8f3 sinh 2n\u0398 \u2212 tr\nif (2n \u2212 1)t1/2 < tr < 2nt1/2\nh\u03c4 i\n\nThe analytic form contains as a parameter the average lifetime h\u03c4 (T, H)iL , which was measured in independent fieldreversal simulations. Thus, as for the order-parameter distribution above, no fitting parameters are involved in the\ncomparison between the simulation data and the analytical form. The generic feature of the rtd is the structure of the\npeaks, which are centered at odd multiples of the half-period (i.e., at (2n \u2212 1)t1/2 , n = 1, 2, . . .), with exponentially\ndecaying heights, as has also been observed in simulations with a sinusoidally varying field [9, 11, 31]. This behavior\nis characteristic of systems undergoing stochastic resonance [28, 45, 46].\nIn the phase diagram shown in Fig. 4(a), the weak-noise stochastic-resonance [28] behavior described here occurs\nin the wedge-shaped region between the two crossover curves, TDSP (L) and T\u00d7 (L), as already discussed in Sec. II.\nAnalogous behavior was discussed in detail in Ref. [31] for the case of a sinusoidal driving field.\nAs T is lowered further for the small system, the average metastable lifetime quickly increases, and the probability\nof not switching during a half-period, Pnot (t1/2 ; L, T, H), approaches unity. As discussed in Sec. II, the crossover\ntemperature T\u00d7 (L) corresponds to Pnot = 1/2. Consequently, switching events become rare, and the central peak in\nP (Q) essentially disappears, leaving only the two sharp peaks near \u00b11 [see Fig. 8(d)]. At the same time, UL again\nbecomes positive [see Fig. 4(c)]. Significantly below T\u00d7 (L), switching will never be observed during a finite number of\nperiods, and the system is completely \"frozen\" into one of its two metastable wells [see Fig. 2(c)]. This yields h|Q|i\u22481\nand UL \u22482/3, as shown in Fig. 4(b) and (c), respectively.\nB.\n\nLarge systems\n\n2\nFor larger systems [L>\n\u223cO(10 ) for t1/2 =50 MCSS], at high temperatures the system is deeply in the MD regime\n[Fig 4(a)], where the lifetime is independent of L. Here, h\u03c4 (T, H)i is significantly smaller than t1/2 . The limit cycle of\nthe magnetization is symmetric [Fig. 3(a)], and the fluctuations in Q are Gaussian and centered about zero [Fig. 9(a)\n\n9\n\n\f(b)\n\n0.5\n1.0\n\nP(Q)\n\nm(t), H(t)/H\n\n1.5\n\n(a)\n\n1.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\u22120.5\n\n\u22121.0\n84000\n\n86000\n\n88000\n\nt\n\n90000\n\n0.0\n\n92000\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n\nQ\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nFIG. 10:\nOrder-parameter statistics for H=2.0J, T =0.34J, and L=32, which yield h\u03c4 (T, H)iL =233 MCSS, with\nt1/2 =500 MCSS.

In this regime, both h|Q|iL \u223c0 and UL \u223c0, up to finite-size effects [Fig. 4(b) and (c)]. Upon lowering the\ntemperature, the underlying decay mode remains MD, but the lifetime increases and eventually becomes comparable\nwith the half-period. This happens well before T reaches TDSP (L). When h\u03c4 (T, H)i becomes approximately equal to\nt1/2 , the system undergoes a genuine continuous phase transition, the DPT [1, 12, 14]. The system magnetization\nperforms a slow \"wandering\" motion [Fig. 3(b)], and the distribution for Q widens significantly [Fig. 9(c)]. Below the\ntransition, P (Q) becomes bimodal [Fig. 9(d)], h|Q|iL \u223cO(1) [Fig. 4(b)], and UL approaches its ordered-phase value\n2/3 without exhibiting negative values or a minimum [Fig. 4(c)]. Also, UL for different large values of L intersect\nat the temperature corresponding to the DPT [Figs. 4(c), 5(c), 6(c), and 7(c)], as expected for a continuous phase\ntransition [33]. Detailed finite-size-scaling analysis of Monte Carlo simulations for systems that are large enough that\nthe underlying metastable decay mode is MD, are found in Refs. [1, 12, 14].\nAs T is reduced further, the underlying decay mode crosses over to the SD regime at TDSP (L). This leads to\nextremely large metastable average lifetimes, such that Pnot approaches unity. However, this has no effect on the observables: below the DPT, the system is already performing asymmetric limit cycles, confined to one of its metastable\nwells [Fig.3(c)].\n\n10\n\n\fC.\n\nComparison\n\nFrom the above discussion for small and large systems, it is clear that the qualitative behavior observed as the\ntemperature is varied depends strongly on the field amplitude, the half-period, and the system size. For example, for\n2\nH=2.0J and t1/2 =50 MCSS one must employ L>\n\u223cO(10 ) in order for the underlying metastable decay mode to become\n3\nMD, so that the DPT is observed [Fig. 4(c)]. For the same field amplitude and t1/2 =500 MCSS one needs L>\n\u223cO(10 )\nto achieve the same effect [Fig. 5(c)]. For larger and larger half-periods, the \"infinite\"-system DPT (h\u03c4 (T, H)i\u2248t1/2 )\noccurs at lower and lower temperatures. However, at these low temperatures, it takes exponentially large systems to\nbe in the MD regime, as seen from Eq. (4). By increasing t1/2 , one therefore quickly reaches the limit of any available\ncomputational resources.\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\n\nWe addressed the finite-size effects of the periodic response of spatially extended bistable systems by studying the\ntwo-dimensional kinetic Ising model in an oscillating external field. The intimate connection between the underlying metastable decay modes and the periodic response of spatially extended bistable systems has been stated and\ndemonstrated several times [1, 10, 11, 12, 14, 31]. On the other hand, it has been claimed repeatedly [9, 26, 27] that\nfor large enough periods (low-frequency regime), the dynamic phase transition (DPT) becomes first-order. In the\npresent study we focused explicitly on demonstrating that any signatures resembling a first-order transition at lower\ntemperatures are merely finite-size effects that disappear as L is increased sufficiently.\nFirst, we reviewed the basics of the well-known theory of homogeneous nucleation. Understanding the relevant timeand length scales and the various decay modes [multi-droplet (MD) and single-droplet (SD)] in metastable decay, one\ncan estimate the important system-size dependent crossovers for the periodic response. Next we presented extensive\nnew simulation results indicating that no first-order transition exists for any frequency, and consequently, there can be\nno tri-critical point separating lines of first-order and continuous dynamic phase transitions. The behavior, correctly\nobserved in Ref. [9] but misinterpreted as indicating the existence of a first-order DPT, is due to the stochastic nature\nof the underlying single-droplet metastable decay. In this regime the system exhibits stochastic resonance. However,\nthis behavior does not survive in the large-system limit with fixed field amplitude.\nAcknowledgments\n\nG.K. and M.A.N thank Z.

Then, knowing\nthat the nucleation of a critical droplet is a Poisson process (i.e., the probability density of the switching time is\nexponential) with rate h\u03c4 i\u22121 , we can calculate the probability density function (pdf) for the dynamic order parameter\nP (Q). It is important to recall that in the definition of Q we included both types of averaging: averaging over a\nperiod when the driving field starts with negative value and also when it starts with a positive value in the first\nhalf-period. Here we show the calculation of the former case P\u2212 (Q). The calculation for the latter is identical and\nat the end one simply has to add them together with weight 1/2, resembling the way the histogram was collected:\nP (Q)=[P\u2212 (Q)+P+ (Q)]/2.\nWhen the driving field is negative in the first half-period, there are five mutually distinct scenarios as illustrated\non the schematic plots in Fig. 12(a-e). In cases (a), (b), and (c) the value of the magnetization m(t) is +1 at the\nbeginning of the period, while in cases (d) and (e) it is \u22121. Since we are interested in the stationary distribution\n\u2212\nof Q, first we have to find the stationary probabilities p+\n\u221e (p\u221e ) that the magnetization has the value +1 (\u22121) at\nthe beginning of a period.

Now for each case (a-e), we consider the conditional\n\u221e =1/(1 + e\n\u221e =e\nprobability density of Q (conditional on the value of the magnetization at the beginning of the period). In case\n(a) Q=1 with probability e\u2212\u0398 , i.e., that the magnetization does not switch in the first half-period, yielding a deltafunction contribution e\u2212\u0398 \u03b4(Q \u2212 1) to the full pdf. In case (b) the magnetization switches at t1 in the first halfperiod and does not switch back in the second, resulting in Q=(t1 \u2212 t1/2 )/t1/2 . The contribution to the pdf is\ne\u2212\u0398 h\u03b4(Q \u2212 (t1 \u2212 t1/2 )/t1/2 )it1 , where h. . .it1 is an averaging over the exponentially distributed switching time t1 .\nIn case (c) the magnetization switches twice, at t1 in the first half-period and at t2 in the second one, resulting in\nQ=(t1 \u2212 t2 )/t1/2 . The contribution to the pdf is h\u03b4(Q \u2212 (t1 \u2212 t2 )/t1/2 )it1 ,t2 , where h. . .it1 ,t2 is an averaging over the\nexponentially distributed switching times t1 and t2 , occurring independently in the first and second half-period (and\nmeasured from the beginning of their respective half-periods). In case (d) the initial value of the magnetization is \u22121\nand it does not switch in the second half-period, yielding e\u2212\u0398 \u03b4(Q + 1). In case (e) the magnetization switches once\nat t2 in the second half-period resulting in Q=\u2212t2 /t1/2 and a contribution h\u03b4(Q + t2 /t1/2 )it2 to the pdf.

The derivation follows that given for a sinusoidally oscillating field\nin the Appendix of Ref. [31]. However, the present case is simpler since the probability that a switching event has\nnot occurred within a time t after the field has changed its sign to become opposite to the magnetization direction,\nPnot (t; L, T, H), is a simple exponential, exp(\u2212t/h\u03c4 (T, H)iL ) [see Eq. (5)]. As a consequence, all the integrals that\nhave to be evaluated numerically in the sinusoidal case, can here be trivially calculated analytically. Provided the\nmagnetization switched in a period (say period n=1) at time t1 (measured from the instant the driving field changed\nsign), the next magnetization switching occurring in the nth period at t2 (also measured from the instant the driving\nfield changed sign) results in a residence time tr = (2n \u2212 1)t1/2 \u2212 t1 + t2 , where t1 and t2 are exponentially distributed\nvariables. The formal expression for the rtd then can be written as\nPr (tr ) =\n\n\u221e\nX\ne\u2212(n\u22121)\u0398\nh\u03b4(tr \u2212 (2n \u2212 1)t1/2 + t1 \u2212 t2 )it1 ,t2\n1 \u2212 e\u2212\u0398\nn=1\n\nCarrying out the averages above yields, after some rearrangement,\n\uf8f1\nh\ni\n\uf8f2 sinh tr \u2212 2(n \u2212 1)\u0398 if 2(n \u2212 1)t1/2 < tr < (2n \u2212 1)t1/2\n1 e\u2212n\u0398\nh\u03c4\ni\ni\nh\n\u00d7\nPr (tr ) =\n,\nh\u03c4 i 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u0398 \uf8f3 sinh 2n\u0398 \u2212 tr\nif (2n \u2212 1)t1/2 < tr < 2nt1/2\nh\u03c4 i\n\n(B1)\n\n(B2)\n\nwhere n=1, 2, . . ..\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\n\nS.

[23, 24]\nis somewhat less obvious in that no microscopic dynamics is defined here for the dynamic order parameter (the periodaveraged magnetization). Further, a priori it could not be known whether or not the period-averaging in time introduces\nlong-range effective interactions for the local dynamic order parameter.\nM. Acharyya and B. K.

(4) and (6) we employed the low-temperature approximation for the classical theory\nof nucleation and growth where the shape-, prefactor, and the free energy of the critical droplet are independent of the\ntemperature [38]. In particular, for the shape factor we used \u03a92 \u2248 4, corresponding to a square droplet. For the the prefactor\nwe used C(T, H)\u22483/8, 1.36, and 5/4 for H\u2208(J, 2J), H=2J, and H\u2208(2J, 4J), respectively [38]. For the free energy of the\ncritical droplet we used F (T, H)\u224816J\u22126H, 4J, and 8J\u22122H for H\u2208(J, 2J], H=2J, and H\u2208[2J, 4J), respectively [38]. The\nvelocity v(T, H) was obtained from Eqs. (13) and (21) of Ref. [37]\n[37] P. A. Rikvold and M. Kolesik, J. Stat. Phys. 100 377 (2000).\n[38] M. A.
