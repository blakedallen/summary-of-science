Sear hes for the Standard\nModel Higgs boson, exploiting the predi tion for its de ay modes and also sear hes for invisible\nHiggs boson de ays as predi ted by various extensions of the Standard Model ex luded Higgs\nmasses up to 114.4 GeV [1, 2\u2104. These latter sear hes assumed a rather small invisible de ay width\nomparable to the predi ted Standard Model de ay width for a light Higgs boson and well below\nthe experimentally a hievable mass resolution of about 3 to 5 GeV.\nRe ent theories that postulate the existen e of additional spatial dimensions o\u001ber a new\npossibility for invisible Higgs de ays [3\u2104. In su h theories the Plan k mass is lowered to the TeV\nrange and a ri h spe trum of new parti les appears, like gravis alars in the ase of \u001dat extra\ndimensions. Hen e the Higgs boson an mix with the gravis alars, whi h leads to a missing\nenergy signature in the dete tor [3\u2104. This mixing an result in a large invisible de ay width of\nthe Higgs boson, depending on the model parameters, and would therefore alter the Standard\nModel bran hing ratios. As a onsequen e of the broadening of the Higgs resonan e in the\nre oil mass spe trum, the signal-to-ba kground ratio an deteriorate signi\u001c antly. In a worst\nase s enario, sear hes optimised under the assumption of a narrow Higgs resonan e might have\nmissed the dete tion of a kinemati ally a essible Higgs boson at LEP.\nThis paper des ribes a sear h for the Higgs boson, H, whi h imposes no onstraints on the\ntotal de ay width. The Higgs boson is assumed to be produ ed in asso iation with a Z boson\nvia the Bjorken pro ess, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 HZ, where the Z is required to de ay hadroni ally and the\ninvisible Higgs boson is dete ted as missing energy EMIS in the event. The results are presented\nin a model-independent way in terms of limits on the Bjorken produ tion ross-se tion times\nbran hing ratio, \u03c3(MH , \u0393H ) \u00d7 BR(H \u2192 EMIS ), at a entre-of-mass energy of 206 GeV, where\n\u0393H is the Breit\u0015Wigner width of the Higgs boson. A simple model extending the Standard\nModel with additional SU(3)C \u00d7SU(2)L \u00d7U(1)Y singlet \u001celds whi h intera t strongly with the\nHiggs boson (\u0010stealthy Higgs s enario\u0011 [4\u2104) is hosen as an example for the interpretation of the\nresult. This intera tion gives rise to a large invisible de ay width of the Higgs boson. This\ndedi ated sear h expands on the previous de ay-mode-independent sear h [5\u2104 arried out by the\nOPAL Collaboration whi h reported for the \u001crst time limits on the HZ produ tion ross-se tion,\ninterpreted in the stealthy Higgs model.\nThe paper is organised as follows. Se tion 2 introdu es the stealthy Higgs s enario. Se tion\n3 gives details about the modelling of signal and ba kground. Se tion 4 des ribes the sear h and\nthe results are interpreted in Se tion 5. We summarise the results in Se tion 6.\n\n2 The stealthy Higgs s enario\nIn general renormalisable theories there might be other fundamental s alars, in addition to the\nStandard Model Higgs boson, that do not intera t with normal matter. To investigate the in\u001duen e of a hidden s alar se tor on the Higgs observables the stealthy Higgs s enario onje tures\nthe existen e of additional SU(3)C \u00d7SU(2)L \u00d7U(1)Y singlet \u001celds alled phions. Radiative orre tions to weak pro esses are not sensitive to the presen e of singlets in the theory be ause no\nFeynman graphs ontaining singlets appear at the one-loop level. Sin e e\u001be ts at the two-loop\nlevel are below the experimental pre ision, the presen e of a singlet se tor is not ruled out by any\nLEP 1 pre ision data [4\u2104. These phions would not intera t via the strong or ele tro-weak for es,\nbut ouple only to the Higgs boson [4\u2104, thus o\u001bering invisible de ay modes to the Higgs. The\nwidth of the Higgs resonan e an be ome large if either the number of su h singlets, N , or the\noupling, \u03c9 , is large, thus leading to a broad mass spe trum re oiling against the re onstru ted\nZ boson.\n4\n\n\fNegle ting the fermioni part for the moment, the Lagrangian of the s alar se tor in this\nmodel, adding only four new parameters to the Standard Model, is given by\n(1)\n\nLscalar = LHiggs + Lphion + Linteraction\nLHiggs = \u2212\u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2020 \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 \u03bb (\u03c6\u2020 \u03c6 \u2212\n\nv2\n2\n\n)2\n\n(2)\n\n\u03ba\n1\n1\n~2 \u2212\n~ \u2202 \u03bc\u03c6\n~ \u2212 m2phion \u03c6\n(~\n\u03c62 )2\nLphion = \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\n2\n2\n8N\n\u03c9\nLinteraction = \u2212 \u221a \u03c6\n~ 2 \u03c6\u2020 \u03c6.\n2 N\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nThe term LHiggs des ribes the usual Standard Model Higgs doublet \u03c6 a quiring the Standard\nModel va uum expe tation value, v , and having its self- oupling \u03bb. In the free Lagrangian of\ns alar singlets, Lphion , the singlets with mass mphion are denoted as the O(N )-symmetri multiplet\n\u03c6\n~ . The phions also have a self- oupling \u03ba, whi h is \u001cxed at \u03ba(2MZ ) = 0, to allow for the widest\nparameter range of the model. The self oupling term entering loop al ulations is suppressed like\n1/N . The intera tion term between the Higgs and the additional phions, Linteraction , leads to the\nphenomenologi al onsequen e of invisible Higgs de ays be ause the Higgs boson ouples to the\nphions independently of their mass. The strength of the oupling is instead proportional to the\noupling onstant \u03c9 , whi h is a free parameter of the model. Even though the\n\u221a va uum-indu ed\nmass term of the phions after the symmetry-breaking is suppressed like 1/ N [4\u2104, the phions\no ur in loop orre tions to the Higgs boson propagator and therefore a\u001be t the resonan e width\nof the Higgs boson. An analyti expression [6\u2104 for the hange in the Higgs width ompared to\nthe Standard Model de ay width, \u0393SM , an be found in the limit N \u2192 \u221e, when negle ting the\nself- oupling of the phions as a small e\u001be t:\n\n\u0393H (MH ) = \u0393SM (MH ) +\n\nq\n\u03c92 v2\n\u00d7 1 \u2212 4m2phion /MH2 .\n32 \u03c0 MH\n\n(5)\n\nThe ross-se tion for the Bjorken pro ess an be al ulated from Equations 9 and 10 of referen e [4\u2104. Using the parametrisation for the invisible de ay width (Equation 1 and 2 in [7\u2104) one\nan express the total ross-se tion for the produ tion and invisible de ay by\n\n\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192Z+EMIS ) =\n\nZ\n\ndsI \u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192ZH) (sI )\n\n\u221a\n\nsI \u0393inv\nH\n.\n\u03c0((MH2 \u2212 sI )2 + sI \u03932H )\n\n(6)\n\nHere sI denotes the invariant mass squared of the invisible de ay produ ts of the Higgs boson.\nThe produ tion rate of these invisible masses is given by the Standard Model ross-se tion1\n\u221a\n\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192ZH) (sI ) for a Higgs boson of mass sI . Hen e the Standard Model ross-se tion ompletely determines the dependen e of the total ross-se tion on the entre-of-mass energy (see e.g.\nin [8\u2104). Therefore the total ross-se tion goes rapidly to zero for Higgs boson masses above the\nkinemati limit. The e\u001be t of the onvolution with the Breit-Wigner-like fun tion is a broadening\nof the resonan e in the re oil mass spe trum and hen e a dilution of the signal-to-ba kground\nratio. In extreme ases of large invisible de ay width one ould expe t the Higgs re oil mass spe trum to mimi the ba kground. In su h extreme ases even a light and kinemati ally a essible\nHiggs boson might have es aped dete tion at LEP.\nIn Se tion 5.2 we derive limits on the stealthy Higgs model under the assumption of mphion =\n0. By simulating signal spe tra for di\u001berent Higgs boson masses MH and widths \u0393H , we set limits\nin the \u03c9 -MH plane in the large N limit.\n1\n\nBy\n\nhoosing\n\n\u03c9 > 0 one\n\nan prevent the phions from a quiring a non-zero va uum expe tation value and avoid\n\na Higgs-phion mixing due to a non-diagonal mass matrix. In\n\nase of non-zero mixing, the\n\ns alar to the gauge boson would de rease proportional to the\nross-se tion of the Bjorken pro ess would be lowered.\n\n5\n\nosine of the mixing angle.\n\nouplings of the lightest\nAs a\n\nonsequen e the\n\n\f3 Data sets and Monte Carlo samples\n\n3.1 The OPAL dete tor and event re onstru tion\nThe OPAL dete tor [9\u2104, operated between 1989 and 2000 at LEP, had nearly omplete solid\nangle3 overage and ex ellent hermeti ity. The innermost dete tor of the entral tra king was a\nhigh-resolution sili on mi rostrip vertex dete tor [10\u2104 whi h lay immediately outside the beam\npipe. The sili on mi rovertex dete tor was surrounded by a high pre ision vertex drift hamber,\na large volume jet hamber, and z \u0015 hambers whi h measured the z oordinates of tra ks, all in a\nuniform 0.435 T axial magneti \u001celd. A lead-glass ele tromagneti alorimeter with presampler\nwas lo ated outside the magnet oil. In ombination with the forward alorimeters, a forward\nring of lead-s intillator modules (the \u0010gamma at her\u0011), a forward s intillating tile ounter [9, 11\u2104,\nand the sili on-tungsten luminometer [12\u2104, the alorimeters provided a geometri al a eptan e\ndown to 25 mrad from the beam dire tion. The sili on-tungsten luminometer served to measure\nthe integrated luminosity using small angle Bhabha s attering events [13\u2104. The magnet return\nyoke was instrumented with streamer tubes and thin gap hambers for hadron alorimetry and\nis surrounded by several layers of muon hambers.\nThe analysis is based on data olle ted with the OPAL dete tor at LEP 2 from 1997 to\n2000 at entre-of-mass energies between 183 and 209 GeV. The integrated luminosity analysed\nis 629.1 pb\u22121 . To ompare with the Standard Model Monte Carlo the data are binned in \u001cve\nnominal entre-of-mass-energy points, orresponding to the energies at whi h the Monte Carlo\nis produ ed, as detailed in Table 1.\nA fast online \u001cltering algorithm lassi\u001ces the events as multi-hadroni . Events are re onstru ted from tra ks and energy deposits (\u0010 lusters\u0011) in the ele tromagneti and hadroni alorimeters. All tra ks and energy lusters satisfying quality requests similar to those des ribed in [14\u2104\nare asso iated to form \u0010energy \u001dow obje ts\u0011. The measured energies are orre ted for double\nounting of energy in the tra king hambers and alorimeters by the algorithm des ribed in [14\u2104.\nGlobal event variables, su h as transverse momentum and visible mass, are then re onstru ted\nfrom these obje ts and all events are for ed into a two-jet topology using the Durham algorithm\n[15\u2104.\n\n3.2 Signal and ba kground modelling\nTo determine the dete tion e\u001e ien y for a signal from an invisibly de aying Higgs boson and the\namount of expe ted ba kground from Standard Model pro esses, several Monte Carlo samples\nare used. Signal events for a hypotheti al Higgs boson mass MH de aying with arbitrary broad\nwidth \u0393H are simulated by reweighting invisibly de aying events of type H \u2192 \u03c701 \u03c701 . The mass\nof neutralinos \u03c701 is hosen su h that the Higgs boson with mass mi an de ay into a pair of\nneutralinos, whi h leave the dete tor without being dete ted. These Higgs bosons with de ays\ninto `invisible' parti les are generated with masses mi from 1 GeV to 120 GeV with the HZHA [16\u2104\ngenerator. The HZHA events are generated assuming the Standard Model produ tion rossse tion \u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192ZH) for the Higgs boson. The test masses mi are spa ed in steps of 1 GeV. The\nspa ing of the test masses is hosen su h that they are not resolved by the dete tor in the signal\nyielded after a reweighting pro edure des ribed in the following. From Equation 6 one extra ts\nthe event weights wi (mi ; MH , \u0393H ) for a mass point mi ontributing to the sear h for a Higgs\nboson of mass MH and total de ay width \u0393H . The total de ay width \u0393H is de\u001cned as the sum of\n3\n\nOPAL\n\nand the\n\nx\n\nused a right-handed\n\noordinate system. The\n\naxis was horizontal pointing towards the\n\nrespe t to the\n\nz\n\naxis, the azimuthal angle\n\n\u03c6\n\nz\n\naxis pointed along the dire tion of the ele tron beam\n\nentre of the LEP ring.

The\nunweighted signal Monte Carlo samples ontain 2000 events per mass point mi . In the reweighted\nsignal Monte Carlo sample all test masses ontribute a ording to their weight. The reweighted\nmasses MH range from 1 to 120 GeV spa ed in steps of 1 GeV. The smallest width simulated\nby this pro edure is a \u0393H of 1 GeV and the largest a \u0393H of 3 TeV. The dete tion e\u001e ien y for\na Higgs boson with MH and \u0393H is estimated by the sum of sele ted event weights assuming\nbinomial errors.\nThe lasses of Standard Model ba kground pro esses onsidered are two-photon2 , two- and\nfour-fermion pro esses. For simulation of ba kground pro esses the following generators are\nused: KK2F [17\u2104 and PYTHIA [18\u2104 (qq\u0304(\u03b3)), GRC4F [19\u2104 (four-fermion pro esses), PHOJET [20\u2104,\nHERWIG [21\u2104, Vermaseren [22\u2104 (hadroni and leptoni two-photon pro esses). For Monte Carlo\ngenerators other than HERWIG, the hadronisation is done using JETSET 7.4 [18\u2104. The integrated\nluminosity of the main ba kground Monte Carlo samples is at least 15 times the statisti s of the\ndata for the two-fermion ba kground, 24 times for the four-fermion ba kground and 30 times for\nthe two-photon ba kground. The Monte Carlo events are passed through a detailed simulation\nof the OPAL dete tor [23\u2104 and are re onstru ted using the same algorithms as for the real data.\n\n4 Sear h for e+e\u2212 \u2192 HZ with Z \u2192 qq\u0304 and H \u2192 EMIS \u001cnal state\nThe event sele tion is intended to be e\u001e ient for the omplete range of possible Higgs masses\nMH and orresponding de ay widths \u0393H studied in this sear h. The presele tion uts remain\nrelatively loose be ause the \u001cnal dis rimination between signal and ba kground is done by a\nlikelihood-based sele tion. The optimised likelihood sele tion has to a ount for the fa t that\nthe kinemati al properties of the signal hange onsiderably over the range of masses and width\nhypotheses onsidered.\n\n4.1 Event topologies\nThe signal signature is generally hara terised by an a oplanar two-jet system from the Z boson\nde ay. We use the term `a oplanar' for jet pairs if the two jet axes and the beam axis are\nnot onsistent with lying in a single plane. The de ay produ ts of the Z boson are preferentially\nemitted into the entral part of the dete tor, re oiling against the invisibly de aying Higgs boson.\nThis is be ause, in ontrast to the irredu ible ba kground of ZZ \u2192 qq\u0304 \u03bd\u03bd whi h is produ ed\nwith an angular dependen e of the di\u001berential ross-se tion proportional to cos2 \u03b8 , the Bjorken\npro ess is proportional to sin2 \u03b8 . The Higgs boson de ay leads to a large missing momentum and\na signi\u001c ant amount of missing energy. In two-photon pro esses, where the in oming ele tron\nand positron are s attered at low angles, usually one or both of the ele trons remain undete ted.\nEvents of this type have large missing momentum with the missing momentum ve tor, p\n~MIS ,\n2\n\nTwo-photon intera tions o\n\nur when an ele tron and a positron at high energies and in\n\na pair of photons whi h intera t via the ele tromagneti\n\nfor e to generate a fermion pair.\n\n7\n\nlose proximity emit\n\n\fpointing at low angles to the beam axis. The two-photon events have a small visible invariant\nmass MVIS and a tiny transverse momentum pT\nMIS but a onsiderable longitudinal momentum\nalong the z -axis in the ommon ase that the two photons do not have equal energy. Due to\nthese spe ial hara teristi s this ba kground an be easily redu ed to a negligible level.\nThe two-fermion ba kground important for this sear h onsists of Z/\u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 qq\u0304(\u03b3) events.\nThese events tend to have a big ross-se tion if one or more initial state radiation photons\n\u221a \u2032\n(abbreviated as ISR photons) are emitted so that the e\u001be tive entre-of-mass energy s is\nredu ed to a value near the Z-resonan e (so- alled radiative return events). The emission of ISR\nphotons happens predominantly at small polar angles. In ase of a mismeasurement or es ape\nof the ISR photons through the beam pipe these events have a sizeable missing momentum\npreferentially oriented at small polar angles, lose to the beam pipe. In su h events the two jets\nare almost oplanar.\nThe most di\u001e ult ba kground to separate is four-fermion pro esses with neutrinos in the\n\u001cnal state, su h as W+ W\u2212 \u2192 l\u00b1 \u03bd qq\u0304 and W \u00b1 e\u2213 \u03bd \u2192 qq\u0304e\u2213 \u03bd with the harged lepton es aping\ndete tion. The irredu ible ba kground to this sear h stems from ZZ \u2192 \u03bd\u03bdqq\u0304 (about 28 % of all\nZZ de ays) leading to a signature indistinguishable from a signal event with a Higgs mass lose\nto the Z boson mass. The ve tor bosons are usually not produ ed at rest, leading to a transverse\nmomentum of the two-jet system and therefore to a large a oplanarity of the jets, as in the signal\nase. Furthermore, the missing momentum ve tor points into the entral dete tor more often\nthan for the two-fermion ase. To dis riminate between this ba kground and the signal one an\nexploit the di\u001beren e in the angular distribution of the di\u001berential produ tion ross-se tion.\n\n4.2 Presele tion\nThe \u001cnal dis rimination between signal and ba kground is made using a likelihood sele tion.\nTherefore the presele tion uts remain relatively loose. From ut No.(5) onwards the ut values\nhave been tuned at a entre-of-mass energy of 206 GeV using a simple \u001cgure of merit (FoM) that\nis independent of the a priori unknown signal ross-se tion. Given only the signal e\u001e ien y \u01eb\nand the ba kground expe tation Bexp as a fun tion of a ut, this \u001cgure is de\u001cned as FoM =\n\u221a\n2.1 \u00d7 Bexp + 2.4/\u01eb. This FoM gives a reasonable approximation to the median number of signal\nevents that an be ex luded at 95 % on\u001cden e level using the likelihood ratio. Hen e a smaller\nFoM orresponds to a better presele tion.\nIn order to redu e the amount of ba kground data only a subset ful\u001clling the following quality\nriteria is analysed. The following uts remove almost all the two-photon ba kground:\n(1) To redu e two-photon and a elerator indu ed ba kground, tra k riteria are applied demanding that more than 20 % of all tra ks be quali\u001ced as good measured tra ks [24\u2104 and\nthat at least 6 of them be found.\n(2) A forward energy veto reje ts events with more than 5 GeV in either the left or right\nompartment of the gamma at her alorimeters or the sili on tungsten luminometers.\nEvents with more than 2 GeV in the forward alorimeters are also removed.\n(3) The missing transverse momentum pT\nMIS should ex eed 1 GeV and MVIS has to be larger\nthan 4 GeV.\n(4) Less than 20 % of the measured visible energy EVIS should be lo ated lose to the beam\npipe in the region | cos \u03b8| > 0.9.\n(5) The visible energy EVIS must be less than 90 % of\n\n8\n\n\u221a\ns.\n\n\f(6) It is required that the visible mass of the event should be of order MZ , i.e. 55 GeV <\nMVIS < 105 GeV. An asymmetri ut around the Z mass is hosen, sin e with in reasing\nHiggs mass MH the Z bosons will be more and more o\u001b-shell.\nThe remaining ba kgrounds at this stage, whi h are more di\u001e ult to remove, are mismeasured\nZ/\u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 qq\u0304 events, four-fermion pro esses with neutrinos in the \u001cnal state, su h as W+ W\u2212 \u2192\nl\u00b1 \u03bdqq\u0304 and W \u00b1 e\u2213 \u03bd \u2192 qq\u0304e\u2213 \u03bd with the harged lepton es aping dete tion (see Table 2).\n(7) To sele t events that are well measured in the dete tor with a visible mass MVIS lose to\nMZ and a sizeable transverse momentum pTVIS the following riterion is applied: MVIS +\n\n5 \u00d7 pTVIS >\n\n\u221a\n\ns/2\n\n(8) A large part of the qq\u0304 events and the remaining two-photon ba kground is eliminated by\nrequiring the visible transverse momentum pT\nVIS > 6 GeV.\n(9) To remove ba kgrounds in whi h parti les go undete ted down the beam pipe, the proje tion of the visible momentum along the beam axis, pzVIS , is required to be less than\n\u221a\n0.294 s.\n(10) To redu e the radiative qq\u0304(\u03b3 ) ba kground, the polar angle of the missing momentum ve tor\nmust lie within the region | cos \u03b8MIS | < 0.9.\n(11) The axes of both jets, re onstru ted with the Durham algorithm, are required to have\na polar angle satisfying | cos \u03b8| < 0.9 to ensure good ontainment. Furthermore this ut\nexploits the fa t that events of the WW and ZZ ba kground are produ ed a ording to an\nangular distribution proportional to cos2 \u03b8 .\n(12) The remaining ba kground from Z/\u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 qq\u0304 is hara terised by two jets that tend to be\nba k-to-ba k with small a oplanarity angles, in ontrast to signal events in whi h the jets\nare expe ted to have some a oplanarity angle due to the re oiling Higgs boson. Here the\na oplanarity angle \u03c6ACOPLAN is de\u001cned as 180\u25e6 \u2212 \u03c6jj where \u03c6jj is the angle between the\ntwo jets in the plane perpendi ular to the beam axis. This ba kground is suppressed by\nrequiring that the jet-jet a oplanarity angle be larger than 5\u25e6 .\n(13) W+ W\u2212 events with one of the W bosons de aying leptoni ally and the other de aying\ninto hadroni jets are reje ted by requiring that the events have no isolated leptons. In\nthis ontext, leptons are low-multipli ity jets with one, two or three tra ks, asso iated to\nele tromagneti or hadroni energy lusters, having an invariant mass of less than 2.5 GeV\nand momentum in ex ess of 5 GeV. In the ase of a single-tra k andidate, the lepton is\nonsidered isolated if there are no additional tra ks within an isolation one of 25\u25e6 halfangle, and if the ele tromagneti energy ontained between ones of 5\u25e6 and 25\u25e6 half-angle\naround the tra k does not ex eed 5 % of the sum of the tra k energy and the ele tromagneti\nenergy within the 5\u25e6 half angle one. In the ase of a two- or three-tra k andidate,\nonsisting of the tra ks and ele tromagneti or hadroni energy lusters on\u001cned to a one\nof 7\u25e6 half-angle, the lepton is onsidered isolated if the sum of tra k and ele tromagneti\nenergy between the 7\u25e6 half-angle one and a 25\u25e6 half-angle isolation one does not ex eed\n15 % of the lepton energy.\nFor ea h individual entre-of-mass energy there is good agreement between the numbers of expe ted ba kground events and observed andidates after the presele tion. Table 2 gives the\nnumber of presele ted events summed over all entre-of-mass energies. Figure 1 shows the distributions for ba kground lasses summed over all entre-of-mass energies and three arbitrarily\ns aled signal distributions (at a entre-of-mass energy of 206 GeV). The e\u001e ien ies of the presele tion vary on average between 39 % and 55 % for small de ay widths and between 45 % and\n53 % for larger de ay widths above \u0393H = 100 GeV.\n9\n\n\f4.3 Likelihood analysis\nTo onsider the hanging kinemati properties of the signal hypotheses in an optimal way, \u001cve\ndi\u001berent likelihood-based analyses for the signal and ba kground dis rimination were applied\nafter the presele tion. By a likelihood analysis we denote the ombination of a set of likelihood\ninput variables, a so- alled likelihood, and the orresponding referen e distributions of these\nvariables. The referen e distributions are \u001clled with events of the spe i\u001c lasses for whi h the\nlikelihood is al ulated. The lasses onsidered in this sear h are the two- and four-fermion\nba kgrounds and the signal events. The two-photon events are negligible after the presele tion.\nThe sear h uses ombinations of two likelihoods and three \u001cxed signal mass ranges for unweighted\nreferen e histograms.\nTo ompare the kinemati properties of a sele ted data event to the hypothesis (MH ,\u0393H )\nwhen evaluating the likelihood, one in prin iple has to \u001cll weighted signal referen e distributions\nfor ea h hypothesis (MH ,\u0393H ). This will soon lead to an unmanageable te hni al e\u001bort, given the\nnumber of hypotheses s anned. Therefore a ompromise was sought in whi h ertain kinemati\nproperties of the signal were emphasised and simultaneously the number of referen e histograms\nkept small. This was a hieved by \u001clling unweighted signal referen e histograms. For most of the\n(MH ,\u0393H ) hypotheses all signal masses were used for \u001clling the referen e histograms. This re\u001de ts\nthe fa t that for a very large de ay width of the Higgs boson the possible values of kinemati al\nvariables are also smeared out over a large range. It was, however, found that the sensitivity of\nthe likelihood sele tion (i.e. the median expe ted upper limits on \u03c3(MH , \u0393H ) \u00d7 BR(H \u2192 EMIS ))\nould be in reased further for small widths below 50 GeV by \u001clling referen e histograms with\nsignal masses from 50-80 GeV and from 80-120 GeV for intermediate and heavy Higgs boson\nmasses respe tively. A \u001crst likelihood was designed for a signal onsisting of small masses (MH\n< 80 GeV) or large masses and a very large width (\u0393H \u2265 110 GeV). In this likelihood input\nvariables are used exploiting the hara teristi s of the dominant fra tion of light masses in the\nsignal mass distribution. However for signal masses above MH = 80 GeV and small or moderate\n(i.e. below 110 GeV) de ay widths, the ontribution of large masses dominates the signal mass\ndistribution. In this ase the kinemati s and topology of the signal events are determined by\nthe higher masses lose to the kinemati limit. A se ond likelihood is therefore built with input\nvariables optimised for su h signal hara teristi s. In the following the hoi e of the inputs for\nthe two optimised likelihoods are presented.\nThe \u001crst three input variables are used in both likelihoods (see Figure 3) .\n(1) (1 + P(MVIS \u2261 MZ ))\u22121\nP(MVIS \u2261 MZ ) is the probability of a kinemati al \u03c72 \u001ct of the jet four-ve tors under the\nassumption that the invariant mass of the two jets is ompatible with the Z boson mass.\nThis variable depends only weakly on the Higgs mass. For events with non- onverging \u001ct\nthe probability is set to zero. They therefore a umulate at a value of 1.\n(2) \u2212 log y32\nThe Durham algorithm groups two energy \u001dow obje ts i and j into a jet as long as their\n2\nseparation in phase spa e yij = 2 \u00d7 min(Ei2 , Ej2 ) \u00d7 (1 \u2212 cos(\u03b8ij )/EVIS\nis smaller then the\nut value ycut . The number of jets in a event is prede\u001cned to be 2, y32 is the value of ycut\nwhere the two-jet topology of the event hanges to a three-jet topology. Hen e the negative\nlogarithm of the so- alled jet resolution parameter y32 is a measure for the jet topology\nbeing more two-jet like (large value of \u2212 log y32 ) or three-jet like (small value of \u2212 log y32 ).\n\n\u221a\n\n(3) pT\nMIS / s\nThe transverse missing momentum pT\nMIS is one of the most prominent hara teristi s of\nsignal-like events, but depends very mu h on the Higgs boson mass. For a heavy Higgs\n10\n\n\fboson produ ed lose to the kinemati threshold almost at rest, the Z boson has almost no\nboost and de ays into two more or less ba k-to-ba k jets. In this ase the dis riminating\npower of the variable is lost.\nThe next three variables (see Figure 4) omplete the \u001crst likelihood, whi h is used for all Higgs\nmasses in the domain of very large width > 110 GeV or low Higgs masses < 80 GeV.\n(4) \u03c6ACOL\nThe a olinearity angle \u03c6ACOL of the two-jet system is obtained by subtra ting the threedimensional angle between the re onstru ted jet-axes from 180\u25e6 . Events ontaining a lowmass Higgs boson exhibit on average a larger a olinearity than the ba kground.\n(5) | cos \u03b8 \u2217 |\nThe Gottfried-Ja kson angle \u03b8 \u2217 , is de\u001cned as the angle between the \u001dight dire tion of the\nZ boson in the laboratory frame and the dire tion of the de ay produ ts of the Z boson\nboosted into the Z boson rest-frame. The variable tends to have smaller values for the\nsignal.\n(6) \u2212 log y21\nThe variable \u2212 log y21 is analogous to \u2212 log y32 and measures the ompatibility of the event\nwith a two-jet topology. Two-jet events tend to a umulate at small values of \u2212 log y21 .\nThe last three variables (see Figure 5) tune the se ond likelihood to be ome more sensitive for\nlarge Higgs boson masses and small to moderate widths.\n\n\u221a\n\nMax / s\n(7) EJET\nMax measures the energy of the most energeti of the two jets. This is on\nThe variable EJET\naverage higher for the four-fermion ba kground, due to the boost of the W and Z pairs,\nwhereas heavy Higgs bosons and a Z boson are produ ed at rest.\n\n(8) RPti\nThis variable is the signi\u001c an e of the a oplanarity between the two jets, taking into a ount\ndete tor resolution and a eptan e. The dis rimination power is enhan ed by weighting\nthe a oplanarity with the average jet polar angle, sin e transverse jet dire tions are more\npre isely measured at large polar angles. Signal events tend to have a more signi\u001c ant\na oplanarity and thus larger values of RPti than ba kground. The pre ise de\u001cnition of RPti\nan be found in the OPAL analyses of ZZ \u2192 qq\u03bd\u03bd events [25\u2104.\n(9) (MVIS + MMIS )/(MVIS \u2212 MMIS )\nThis variable, des ribed in [26\u2104, uses two strongly orrelated quantities, the invariant missing mass MMIS and the visible mass of the event MVIS . Depending on the mass re onstru tion a ura y it an have positive or negative values. The signal distribution of this\nvariable is broader and a umulates at higher values than for the two- and four-fermion\nevents, whi h are distributed more narrowly around the origin.\nFrom the two likelihoods and three ranges of signal masses \u001clled in the referen e histograms\none has six analyses to sear h for the di\u001berent hypotheses in MH and \u0393H . The study of the\nmedian expe ted \u03c3(MH , \u0393H ) \u00d7 BR(H \u2192 EMIS ) shows that \u001cve of these six are su\u001e ient to have\nan optimally e\u001e ient analysis for ea h signal hypothesis hara terised by MH and \u0393H (see Figure\n2) in the range studied. Likelihood 1 was not used with the referen e distribution \u001clled for the\nsignal mass range of 80 to 120 GeV. Figure 6 a) to ) and g) to h) display examples for the\nlikelihood distributions of all \u001cve analyses used. In the histograms the events sele ted at all\n11\n\n\f\u001cve entre-of-mass energies are added up, although ea h entre-of-mass energy was evaluated\nseparately in the limit setting as explained in Se tion 5.1. The appropriate likelihood was alulated for ea h ba kground, data and signal event. In ase of a signal event it was added to\nthe histogram with the weight de\u001cned in Equation 7. The number of expe ted signal events is\nnormalised a ording to Equation 6. The use of di\u001berent analyses gives rise to varying shapes of\nthe likelihood distributions of the ba kground. Also the various shapes of the signal likelihood\ndistributions are visible for di\u001berent MH and \u0393H . Sin e the form of the likelihood distributions\nfor signal and ba kground an yield additional information in the limit al ulation, only a loose\nut is applied in the likelihood sele tion, requiring a signal likelihood larger than 0.2.\n\n4.4 Corre tion of ba kground and signal e\u001e ien ies\nA orre tion is applied to the number of expe ted ba kground events and the signal e\u001e ien ies\ndue to noise in the dete tors in the forward region whi h is not modelled by the Monte Carlo.\nThe forward energy veto used in the presele tion an a identally be triggered by ma hine ba kgrounds. The orre tion fa tor is derived from the study of random beam rossings, and applied\nindividually for ea h year of data taking. Random beam rossing events were re orded when no\nphysi s trigger was a tive. The fra tion of events that fail the veto on a tivity in the forward\nregion is below 3.4 % for all runs analysed. The detailed breakdown of the fra tion of a identally\nvetoed events is given in the last olumn of Table 1.\n\n4.5 Systemati un ertainties\nA possible signal in the data would reveal itself by altering the shapes of the distributions of\nthe dis riminating variables. Thus a systemati deviation in the des ription of a re onstru ted\nobservable between Standard Model Monte Carlo and a data sample in whi h the signal is absent,\nould wrongly be attributed to the presen e of a signal.\nThe systemati un ertainties in the Monte Carlo des ription of the kinemati event variables\nare studied in two ontrol samples at a entre-of-mass energy of 206 GeV. In the \u001crst ontrol\nsample, alled two-fermion ontrol-sample in the following, radiative returns ontributing to the\nqq\u0304(\u03b3) pro esses with photons dete ted at large angles are sele ted and the tagged ISR photon\nis removed from the event in Monte Carlo and data. This reates a qq\u0304-like topology with\nmissing momentum at large angles. The se ond ontrol sample, alled four-fermion ontrolsample, is obtained by sele ting W+ W\u2212 \u2192 qq\u0304l\u03bd events and removing the identi\u001ced isolated\nlepton from the events in Monte Carlo and data. After this pro edure ontrol samples possess a\ntopology very similar to signal events. For all kinemati variables x of the presele tion and the\nlikelihood sele tion the mean x and the width of the distribution (RM S ) are ompared between\nMonte Carlo and data, for the two-fermion and four-fermion ontrol-samples. The observables\nin the two-fermion and four-fermion Monte Carlo are then modi\u001ced separately a ording to\nRM SDATA\nxNEW\n= (xOLD\nMC\nMC \u2212 xMC ) \u00d7 RM SMC + xDATA . Then all \u001cve likelihood sele tions are repeated\nseparately and the relative hange in the number of sele ted events ompared to the unmodi\u001ced\nase is taken as the systemati un ertainty.\nSin e the analysis labelled A1 in Table 3 is used over a large range of the sear h plane\n(see Figure 2), the systemati un ertainties on the ba kground determined in this analysis A1\nare taken as an estimate for the ba kground for all analyses. To determine the e\u001be t of the\nsystemati un ertainty on the signal e\u001e ien ies, one has to take into a ount the fa t that\nthe kinemati properties of the signal depend on the assumed Higgs mass and de ay width.\nTwelve representative hypotheses are studied with MH hosen to be 20, 60 or 110 GeV and\n\u0393H taking values of 5, 20, 70 and 200 GeV. For these hypotheses the signal Monte Carlo is\nmodi\u001ced a ording to the four-fermion orre tion fa tors, representing the dominant remaining\nba kground after the ut on the signal likelihood. The relative hange in sele ted event weights\n12\n\n\fompared to the unmodi\u001ced ase is then taken as an estimate of the systemati un ertainty on\nthe signal e\u001e ien y for a given hypothesis. The root-mean-square of all twelve hypotheses is\napplied as an (MH ,\u0393H )-independent estimate for the whole sear h area and for all entre-of-mass\nenergies (see Table 4).\nThe W pairs are very e\u001be tively redu ed in the presele tion by the isolated lepton veto. Due\nto the importan e of this veto the un ertainty from the lepton isolation angle and the vetoed one\nenergy is studied in the following way. The half- one angle of the outer one is in reased and\nde reased by two degrees, following the studies in [27\u2104, and the relative e\u001be t on the sele tion\ndetermined. Furthermore the one energy is varied by 7.4 % and the analyses are repeated.\nThe value of the one energy res aling is determined by the relative deviation of the mean of the\nmeasured energy of the lepton andidates in the inner one between data and Monte Carlo in the\nW+ W\u2212 \u2192 qq\u0304l\u03bd sample. For signal e\u001e ien ies an analogous study was performed at the twelve\npoints des ribed above. Both results for the relative hange of the sele tion for the one opening\nhalf-angle and one energy variation are added in quadrature and the root-mean-square of the 12\n(MH ,\u0393H ) hypotheses was taken to yield the total un ertainty asso iated with the isolated lepton\nveto (see Table 4).\nThe theoreti al predi tion on the ross-se tion for the two- and four-fermion pro esses adds\nan un ertainty of 2 % to the ba kground un ertainty [28\u2104. Finally, the un ertainty due to the\nlimited Monte Carlo statisti s is evaluated.\nTable 5 summarises the results of the studies. All un ertainties are assumed to be un orrelated and the individual ontributions are added in quadrature to obtain the total systemati\nun ertainties on the ba kground expe tation and signal e\u001e ien y. The dominant systemati\nun ertainties on the signal e\u001e ien y arise from the des ription of the kinemati variables. The\nba kground expe tation is more a\u001be ted by the un ertainty in the isolated lepton veto, as the\nmain ontribution of the ba kground stems from four-fermion pro esses. But the un ertainty\nasso iated with the des ription of the kinemati variables is of similar magnitude. The limits\nquoted in Se tion 5.1 were al ulated in luding the un ertainties of Table 5. To estimate the\nextent to whi h the limits depend on the size of the systemati un ertainties, the limit al ulation\nwas repeated doubling the systemati un ertainties. A omparison of the limits with single and\ndouble systemati un ertainties, done at similar representative points as used for the systemati\nstudies, showed that the ex luded ross-se tions typi ally de rease between a half and one and\na half per ent. A maximal redu tion of 2.1 % was found.\n\n5 Results\nThe results of the sear h using ea h of the \u001cve di\u001berent likelihood sele tions, labelled A1-A5, after\na ut on the likelihood larger than 0.2 are summarised in Table 6, whi h ompares the numbers of\nobserved andidates with the Standard Model ba kground expe tations. The data are ompatible\nwith the Standard Model ba kground expe tations. The remaining four-fermion ba kground\nonsists predominantly of W pairs, representing roughly three quarters of the ba kground at\nenergies above the Z pair threshold. Figure 7 shows examples for signal e\u001e ien ies. For small\nde ay widths the dependen e on the entre-of-mass energy is weak up to MH \u2248 80 GeV, and\nfor large widths it is weak up to the kinemati limit. Be ause of the entre-of-mass energy\ndependen e of the Bjorken ross-se tion of a Higgs boson with mass MH , the lower entre-ofmass energies ontribute more signi\u001c antly to the sensitivity for lighter Higgs bosons (see e.g.\nin [8\u2104). For very light Higgs bosons the e\u001e ien y is moderately redu ed by the presele tion uts\ndemanding a sizeable amount of missing energy. In the ase of broader Higgs resonan es with\nhigh mass, one observes a generally enhan ed e\u001e ien y sin e the han e of sele ting events from\nthe low mass tail ompensates the suppression due to the falling produ tion ross-se tion of a\nheavy Higgs boson.\n13\n\n\f5.1 The upper limits on the produ tion ross-se tion times bran hing ratio\nAs no signi\u001c ant ex ess over the expe ted ba kground is observed in the data, upper limits\nare al ulated on the model-independent ross-se tion \u03c3(MH , \u0393H ) \u00d7 BR(H \u2192 EMIS ) s aled to\n\u221a\ns = 206 GeV. As the likelihood distributions are only loosely ut, one an use not only\nthe information from the integral number of sele ted events (Table 6) but also from the shape\nin a likelihood ratio [29\u2104 to set more sensitive upper limits. For ea h entre-of-mass energy\nseparately, ea h bin with a signal likelihood larger than 0.2 in the distributions of expe ted\nsignal, ba kground and sele ted data is treated as a sear h hannel. For ea h entre-of-mass\nenergy the number of expe ted signal events is s aled to the total ross-se tion (Equation 6). As\nwith the analysis des ribed in [30\u2104, the likelihood distributions are given as dis riminating input\nto a limit program [31\u2104. A likelihood ratio is used to determine the signal on\u001cden e level, CLS ,\nde\u001cned in [29, 31\u2104, whi h ex ludes the presen e of a possible signal a ording to the modi\u001ced\nfrequentist approa h [31\u2104. Additionally the program al ulates the median upper number of\nsignal events that ould be ex luded at 95 % on\u001cden e level (CL). This number is then s aled\nto the total ross-se tion at the entre-of-mass energy of 206 GeV for ea h (MH ,\u0393H ) hypothesis.\nThe systemati un ertainties on the ba kground expe tations and signal sele tion e\u001e ien ies are\nin luded a ording a generalisation of the method des ribed in [32\u2104.\nA very \u001cne s an of the (MH ,\u0393H )-plane was performed by simulating the spe tra of Higgs\nbosons with a mass MH from 1 to 120 GeV and widths \u0393H starting at 1 GeV up to 3 TeV. The\nHiggs boson mass was simulated in steps of \u03b4MH = 1 GeV. Simulated values of \u0393H are spa ed\nin steps of 1 GeV up to 5 GeV. A spa ing of \u03b4\u0393H = 5 GeV is hosen from \u0393H = 5 GeV to \u0393H =\n750 GeV. Above this value steps of \u03b4\u0393H = 50 GeV are adopted up to the maximal \u0393H of 3 TeV.\nExamples of the proje tions of the observed upper ross-se tion limits together with the\nmedian expe ted upper limits and the orresponding one and two standard deviation bands\non the expe ted limits are displayed in Figure 8 for some hoi es of \u0393H . Above a width of\n300 GeV the ex lusion plots look quite similar to the example displayed in Figure 8i) be ause\nthe ex luded limits do not hange very mu h. The observed limits for \u0393H & 60 GeV are well\nontained in the one standard deviation bands on the expe tations and generally do not ex eed\ntwo standard deviations ex ept in Figure 8 a) at MH = 114 GeV. The dis ontinuities in the\ngraphs orrespond to hanges in the analyses. As one an observe, below \u0393H . 40 GeV the\nanalysis are hanged more often. Therefore the han e is higher that in a few bins there are\nstatisti al \u001du tuations in the sele ted data, that lead to a deviation of more than one standard\ndeviation around the median. Also the data sele ted are highly orrelated, as one an see for\nexample in the upward \u001du tuation around MH = 114 GeV visible in Figure 8 a)- ). All results\nfor the observed upper limits on \u03c3(MH , \u0393H ) \u00d7 BR(H \u2192 EMIS ) are summarised in a ontour plot\n(Figure 9) in the s anned (MH ,\u0393H )-plane. Above \u0393H = 200 GeV the observed upper limits are\nin the range of 0.15 pb to 0.18 pb for all MH and vary very little. For su h large \u0393H the re oil\nmass distribution of the Higgs tends to be more and more uniformly stret hed out over the mass\nrange explored. There is not mu h di\u001beren e in the sele tion of signal events for a Higgs boson\nwith e.g. a width of 400 GeV or 600 GeV in the onsidered range of Higgs masses. This prevents\nany spe i\u001c dis riminating kinemati al properties from being assigned to the expe ted signal as\nsignal masses of a broad kinemati al range are sele ted with roughly equal probability. Therefore\nonly one likelihood analysis is used in this part of the sear h area, sele ting the same subset of\ndata and ba kground. Sin e the upper limit on the model-independent ross-se tion refers to a\nprodu tion ross-se tion at a entre-of-mass energy of 206 GeV, it must be ome independent of\n(MH ,\u0393H ) for an extremely large \u0393H . In this ase the shape of the Higgs signal would just be\na box, weighted with the produ tion ross-se tion from 1 GeV to the kinemati limit of about\n115 GeV. The data are then ompared to an approximately onstant signal expe tation. Hen e\nthe upper limit on the ross-se tion is approximately independent of the (MH ,\u0393H ) hypothesis at\n\n14\n\n\fa value of roughly 0.16 pb. For resonan es with a de ay width smaller than 200 GeV there are\nregions where the limits are below 0.15 pb or even 0.1 pb for MH between 60 and 74 GeV. In this\nmass range the number of data events sele ted is smaller than expe ted. Above MH of 85 GeV\nthe upper limits be ome larger than 0.2 pb and rise onsiderably for small widths below 40 GeV\n(see Figure 8 a-e). This is due to the fa t that the Higgs mass approa hes the kinemati limit\nand the likelihoods whi h rely on kinemati al variables like pT\nMIS lose dis rimination power. A\nmaximal value of 0.57 pb is observed for MH of 114 GeV and \u0393H of 1 GeV orresponding to a\nir a two-\u03c3 ex ess in the data.\nIt should be kept in mind that no optimisation of the sear h has been performed for \u0393H\nbelow 5 GeV. In the region of heavy Higgs boson mass & 105 GeV and small width a sear h\nusing re oil mass spe tra would be more sensitive. Therefore this region is more sensitively\novered by sear hes that have been performed by the LEP experiments do umented in [2\u2104.\n\n5.2 Interpretation of the result in the stealthy Higgs s enario\nInterpreting the width \u0393H of a Higgs boson a ording to Equation 5, and setting mphion to zero,\nit was possible to set limits on \u03c9 in the stealthy Higgs s enario. A range from \u03c9 = 0.04 to\n\u03c9 = 24.45 was probed. The ex luded regions are shown in Figure 10 at 95 % on\u001cden e level\n(CL) in the \u03c9 -MH parameter spa e. To illustrate the Higgs boson width a ording to Equation 5,\nontours of \u001cxed \u0393H orresponding to a given mass MH and oupling \u03c9 are added to the plot.\nThe maximum ex luded invisible width is about \u0393H = 400 GeV for Higgs boson masses . 35 GeV,\nde reasing slowly to \u0393H = 115 GeV for MH = 100 GeV. The minimal ex lusion of \u03c9 = 0.04 is\nobserved at MH = 1 GeV and the maximal ex lusion is \u03c9 = 5.9 for MH = 73 GeV. For \u03c9 between\n0.04 and 0.59 a Higgs mass from 1 to 103 GeV ould be ex luded. The maximal ex luded Higgs\nmass was 103 GeV for width between 1 and 3 GeV, ompared with the expe ted ex lusion of\n106 GeV.\nThe results presented in this study extend the previous de ay-mode independent sear hes\nfor new s alar bosons with the OPAL dete tor [5\u2104 to regions of larger ouplings and higher\nHiggs boson masses. In [5\u2104 an interpretation within the stealthy Higgs model yielded a maximal\nex luded oupling \u03c9 for masses around 30 GeV, where \u03c9 was ex luded up to \u03c9 = 2.7. That study\nex luded Higgs boson masses up to MH = 81 GeV. It should be pointed out that the de ay-mode\nindependent sear hes also studied Higgs widths between 0.1 and 1 GeV and therefore over the\ngap between sear hes within s enarios assuming a narrow de ay width of the invisibly de aying\nHiggs boson [2\u2104 and the sear h presented in this paper up to MH = 81 GeV.\n\n6 Con lusions\nA dedi ated sear h was performed in the hannel e+ e\u2212 \u2192 HZ with Z \u2192 qq\u0304 and the nonStandard Model de ay H \u2192 EMIS \u001cnal state allowing for invisible de ay widths of the Higgs\nboson from 1 GeV up to 3 TeV. The data taken by the OPAL dete tor at LEP above the W\npair threshold were analysed. No indi ation for a signal was found and upper limits were set on\n\u03c3(MH , \u0393H ) \u00d7 BR(H \u2192 EMIS ). The maximal upper limit is 0.57 pb at MH = 114 GeV and \u0393H =\n1 GeV. Over the s anned region of the (MH ,\u0393H )-plane upper limits are generally of the order of\n0.15 pb, espe ially for large values of \u0393H & 400 GeV or Higgs boson masses . 85 GeV.\nThe limits were interpreted in the stealthy Higgs s enario assuming the presen e of a large\nnumber of massless singlet states. Limits were al ulated on the oupling \u03c9 to a hidden s alar\nse tor of the Higgs boson with a given mass MH . A large part of the parameter plane kinematially a essible with LEP 2 was ex luded extending a previous ex lusion published in [5\u2104. Values\nfor \u03c9 between 0.04 (MH = 1 GeV) and 5.9 (MH = 73 GeV) were ex luded, and for ertain values\nof \u03c9 Higgs boson masses are ex luded up to MH = 103 GeV. The possible non-dete tion of a\n15\n\n\flight Higgs boson at the LEP sear hes due to non-Standard Model invisible Higgs boson de ays\nis therefore restri ted to the ase of extremely large de ay widths & 400 GeV.\n\nA knowledgements\nWe parti ularly wish to thank the SL Division for the e\u001e ient operation of the LEP a elerator\nat all energies and for their lose ooperation with our experimental group.

The analysis is based on data re orded using the OPAL dete tor at LEP at entre-of-mass energies from 183 to 209 GeV orresponding to a total integrated\nluminosity of 629 pb\u22121 . In the analysis only hadroni de ays of the Z boson are onsidered. A\ns an over Higgs boson masses from 1 to 120 GeV and de ay widths from 1 to 3000 GeV revealed\nno indi ation for a signal in the data. From a likelihood ratio of expe ted signal and Standard\nModel ba kground we determine upper limits on ross-se tion times bran hing ratio to an invisible \u001cnal state. For moderate Higgs boson de ay widths, these range from about 0.07 pb (MH =\n60 GeV) to 0.57 pb (MH = 114 GeV). For de ay widths above 200 GeV the upper limits are of the\norder of 0.15 pb. The results an be interpreted in general s enarios predi ting a large invisible\nde ay width of the Higgs boson. As an example we interpret the results in the so- alled stealthy\nHiggs s enario. The limits from this analysis ex lude a large part of the parameter range of this\ns enario experimentally a essible at LEP 2.\n\n(Submitted to Eur. Phys. J.)\n\n\fThe OPAL Collaboration\nG.

Sear hes for the Standard\nModel Higgs boson, exploiting the predi tion for its de ay modes and also sear hes for invisible\nHiggs boson de ays as predi ted by various extensions of the Standard Model, ex luded Higgs\nmasses up to 114.4 GeV [1, 2\u2104. These latter sear hes assumed a rather small invisible de ay width\nomparable to the predi ted Standard Model de ay width for a light Higgs boson and well below\nthe experimentally a hievable mass resolution of about 3 to 5 GeV.\nRe ent theories that postulate the existen e of additional spatial dimensions o\u001ber a new\npossibility for invisible Higgs de ays [3\u2104. In su h theories the Plan k mass is lowered to the TeV\nrange and a ri h spe trum of new parti les appears, like gravis alars in the ase of \u001dat extra\ndimensions. Hen e the Higgs boson an mix with the gravis alars, whi h leads to a missing\nenergy signature in the dete tor [3\u2104. This mixing an result in a large invisible de ay width of\nthe Higgs boson, depending on the model parameters, and would therefore alter the Standard\nModel bran hing ratios. As a onsequen e of the broadening of the Higgs resonan e in the\nre oil mass spe trum, the signal-to-ba kground ratio an deteriorate signi\u001c antly. In a worst\nase s enario, sear hes optimised under the assumption of a narrow Higgs resonan e might have\nmissed the dete tion of a kinemati ally a essible Higgs boson at LEP.\nThis paper des ribes a sear h for the Higgs boson, H, whi h imposes no onstraints on the\ntotal de ay width. The Higgs boson is assumed to be produ ed in asso iation with a Z boson\nvia the Bjorken pro ess, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 HZ, where the Z is required to de ay hadroni ally and the\ninvisible Higgs boson is dete ted as missing energy EMIS in the event. The results are presented\nin a model-independent way in terms of limits on the Bjorken produ tion ross-se tion times\nbran hing ratio, \u03c3(MH , \u0393H ) \u00d7 BR(H \u2192 EMIS ), at a entre-of-mass energy of 206 GeV, where\n\u0393H is the Breit\u0015Wigner width of the Higgs boson. A simple model extending the Standard\nModel with additional SU(3)C \u00d7SU(2)L \u00d7U(1)Y singlet \u001celds whi h intera t strongly with the\nHiggs boson (\u0010stealthy Higgs s enario\u0011 [4\u2104) is hosen as an example for the interpretation of the\nresult. This intera tion gives rise to a large invisible de ay width of the Higgs boson. This\ndedi ated sear h expands on the previous de ay-mode-independent sear h [5\u2104 arried out by the\nOPAL Collaboration whi h reported for the \u001crst time limits on the HZ produ tion ross-se tion,\ninterpreted in the stealthy Higgs model.\nThe paper is organised as follows. Se tion 2 introdu es the stealthy Higgs s enario. Se tion\n3 gives details about the modelling of signal and ba kground. Se tion 4 des ribes the sear h and\nthe results are interpreted in Se tion 5. We summarise the results in Se tion 6.\n\n2 The stealthy Higgs s enario\nIn general renormalisable theories there might be other fundamental s alars, in addition to the\nStandard Model Higgs boson, that do not intera t with normal matter. To investigate the in\u001duen e of a hidden s alar se tor on the Higgs observables the stealthy Higgs s enario onje tures\nthe existen e of additional SU(3)C \u00d7SU(2)L \u00d7U(1)Y singlet \u001celds alled phions. Radiative orre tions to weak pro esses are not sensitive to the presen e of singlets in the theory be ause no\nFeynman graphs ontaining singlets appear at the one-loop level. Sin e e\u001be ts at the two-loop\nlevel are below the experimental pre ision, the presen e of a singlet se tor is not ruled out by any\nLEP 1 pre ision data [4\u2104. These phions would not intera t via the strong or ele tro-weak for es,\nbut ouple only to the Higgs boson [4\u2104, thus o\u001bering invisible de ay modes to the Higgs. The\nwidth of the Higgs resonan e an be ome large if either the number of su h singlets, N , or the\noupling, \u03c9 , is large, thus leading to a broad mass spe trum re oiling against the re onstru ted\nZ boson.\n4\n\n\fThe Lagrangian of the s alar se tor in this model ontains only four additional parameters\nompared to the Standard Model.

In the free Lagrangian of\ns alar singlets, Lphion , the singlets with mass mphion are denoted as the O(N )-symmetri multiplet\n\u03c6\n~ . The phions also have a self- oupling \u03ba, whi h is \u001cxed at \u03ba(2MZ ) = 0, to allow for the widest\nparameter range of the model. The self oupling term entering loop al ulations is suppressed like\n1/N . The intera tion term between the Higgs and the additional phions, Linteraction , leads to the\nphenomenologi al onsequen e of invisible Higgs de ays be ause the Higgs boson ouples to the\nphions independently of their mass. The strength of the oupling is instead proportional to the\noupling onstant \u03c9 , whi h is a free parameter of the model.

Hen e the Standard Model ross-se tion ompletely determines the dependen e of the total ross-se tion on the entre-of-mass energy (see e.g.\nin [8\u2104). Therefore the total ross-se tion goes rapidly to zero for Higgs boson masses above the\nkinemati limit. The e\u001be t of the onvolution with the Breit-Wigner-like fun tion is a broadening\nof the resonan e in the re oil mass spe trum and hen e a dilution of the signal-to-ba kground\nratio.

The innermost dete tor of the entral tra king was a\nhigh-resolution sili on mi rostrip vertex dete tor [10\u2104 whi h lay immediately outside the beam\npipe. The sili on mi rovertex dete tor was surrounded by a high pre ision vertex drift hamber,\na large volume jet hamber, and z \u0015 hambers whi h measured the z oordinates of tra ks, all in a\nuniform 0.435 T axial magneti \u001celd. A lead-glass ele tromagneti alorimeter with presampler\nwas lo ated outside the magnet oil. In ombination with the forward alorimeters, a forward\nring of lead-s intillator modules (the \u0010gamma at her\u0011), a forward s intillating tile ounter [9, 11\u2104,\nand the sili on-tungsten luminometer [12\u2104, the alorimeters provided a geometri al a eptan e\ndown to 25 mrad from the beam dire tion. The sili on-tungsten luminometer served to measure\nthe integrated luminosity using small angle Bhabha s attering events [13\u2104. The magnet return\nyoke was instrumented with streamer tubes and thin gap hambers for hadron alorimetry and\nis surrounded by several layers of muon hambers.\nThe analysis is based on data olle ted with the OPAL dete tor at LEP 2 from 1997 to\n2000 at entre-of-mass energies between 183 and 209 GeV. The integrated luminosity analysed\nis 629.1 pb\u22121 . To ompare with the Standard Model Monte Carlo the data are binned in \u001cve\nnominal entre-of-mass-energy points, orresponding to the energies at whi h the Monte Carlo\nis produ ed, as detailed in Table 1.\nA fast online \u001cltering algorithm lassi\u001ces the events as multi-hadroni .\nEvents are reonstru ted from tra ks and energy deposits (\u0010 lusters\u0011) in the ele tromagneti and hadroni\nalorimeters. All tra ks and energy lusters satisfying quality requests similar to those des ribed in [14\u2104 are asso iated to form \u0010energy \u001dow obje ts\u0011. The measured energies are orre ted\nfor double ounting of energy in the tra king hambers and alorimeters by the algorithm des ribed in [14\u2104. Global event variables, su h as transverse momentum and visible mass, are\nthen re onstru ted from these obje ts and all events are for ed into a two-jet topology using the\nDurham algorithm [15\u2104.\n\n3.2 Signal and ba kground modelling\nTo determine the dete tion e\u001e ien y for a signal from an invisibly de aying Higgs boson and the\namount of expe ted ba kground from Standard Model pro esses, several Monte Carlo samples\nare used. Signal events for a hypotheti al Higgs boson mass MH de aying with arbitrary broad\nwidth \u0393H are simulated by reweighting invisibly de aying events of type H \u2192 \u03c701 \u03c701 . The mass\nof neutralinos \u03c701 is hosen su h that the Higgs boson with mass mi an de ay into a pair of\nneutralinos, whi h leave the dete tor without being dete ted. These Higgs bosons with de ays\ninto `invisible' parti les are generated with masses mi from 1 GeV to 120 GeV with the HZHA [16\u2104\ngenerator. The HZHA events are generated assuming the Standard Model produ tion rossse tion \u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192ZH) for the Higgs boson. The test masses mi are spa ed in steps of 1 GeV. The\nspa ing of the test masses is hosen su h that they are not resolved by the dete tor in the signal\nyielded after a reweighting pro edure des ribed in the following. From Equation 6 one extra ts\nthe event weights wi (mi ; MH , \u0393H ) for a mass point mi ontributing to the sear h for a Higgs\nboson of mass MH and total de ay width \u0393H . The total de ay width \u0393H is de\u001cned as the sum of\n3\n\nOPAL\n\nand the\n\nx\n\nused a right-handed\n\noordinate system.

The\nunweighted signal Monte Carlo samples ontain 2000 events per mass point mi . In the reweighted\nsignal Monte Carlo sample all test masses ontribute a ording to their weight. The reweighted\nmasses MH range from 1 to 120 GeV spa ed in steps of 1 GeV. The smallest width simulated\nby this pro edure is a \u0393H of 1 GeV and the largest a \u0393H of 3 TeV. The dete tion e\u001e ien y for\na Higgs boson with MH and \u0393H is estimated by the sum of sele ted event weights assuming\nbinomial errors.\nThe lasses of Standard Model ba kground pro esses onsidered are two-photon2 , two- and\nfour-fermion pro esses. For simulation of ba kground pro esses the following generators are\nused: KK2F [17\u2104 and PYTHIA [18\u2104 (qq\u0304(\u03b3)), GRC4F [19\u2104 (four-fermion pro esses), PHOJET [20\u2104,\nHERWIG [21\u2104, Vermaseren [22\u2104 (hadroni and leptoni two-photon pro esses). For Monte Carlo\ngenerators other than HERWIG, the hadronisation is done using JETSET 7.4 [18\u2104. The integrated\nluminosity of the main ba kground Monte Carlo samples is at least 15 times the statisti s of the\ndata for the two-fermion ba kground, 24 times for the four-fermion ba kground and 30 times for\nthe two-photon ba kground. The Monte Carlo events are passed through a detailed simulation\nof the OPAL dete tor [23\u2104 and are re onstru ted using the same algorithms as for the real data.\n\n4 Sear h for e+e\u2212 \u2192 HZ with Z \u2192 qq\u0304 and H \u2192 EMIS \u001cnal state\nThe event sele tion is intended to be e\u001e ient for the omplete range of possible Higgs masses\nMH and orresponding de ay widths \u0393H studied in this sear h. The presele tion uts remain\nrelatively loose and are intended to a umulate signal like event topologies in the data. The\n\u001cnal dis rimination between signal and ba kground is done by a likelihood-based sele tion. The\noptimised likelihood sele tion has to a ount for the fa t that the kinemati al properties of the\nsignal hange onsiderably over the range of masses and width hypotheses onsidered.\n\n4.1 Event topologies\nThe signal signature is generally hara terised by an a oplanar two-jet system from the Z boson\nde ay. We use the term `a oplanar' for jet pairs if the two jet axes and the beam axis are\nnot onsistent with lying in a single plane. The de ay produ ts of the Z boson are preferentially\nemitted into the entral part of the dete tor, re oiling against the invisibly de aying Higgs boson.\nThis is be ause, in ontrast to the irredu ible ba kground of ZZ \u2192 qq\u0304 \u03bd\u03bd whi h is produ ed\nwith an angular dependen e of the di\u001berential ross-se tion proportional to cos2 \u03b8 , the Bjorken\npro ess is proportional to sin2 \u03b8 . The Higgs boson de ay leads to a large missing momentum and\na signi\u001c ant amount of missing energy. In two-photon pro esses, where the in oming ele tron\nand positron are s attered at low angles, usually one or both of the ele trons remain undete ted.\nEvents of this type have large missing momentum with the missing momentum ve tor, p\n~MIS ,\n2\n\nTwo-photon intera tions o\n\nur when an ele tron and a positron at high energies and in\n\na pair of photons whi h intera t via the ele tromagneti\n\nfor e to generate a fermion pair.\n\n7\n\nlose proximity emit\n\n\fpointing at low angles to the beam axis. The two-photon events have a small visible invariant\nmass MVIS and a tiny transverse momentum pT\nMIS but a onsiderable longitudinal momentum\nalong the z -axis in the ommon ase that the two photons do not have equal energy. Due to\nthese spe ial hara teristi s this ba kground an be easily redu ed to a negligible level.\nThe two-fermion ba kground important for this sear h onsists of Z/\u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 qq\u0304(\u03b3) events.\nThese events tend to have a big ross-se tion if one or more initial state radiation photons\n\u221a \u2032\n(abbreviated as ISR photons) are emitted so that the e\u001be tive entre-of-mass energy s is\nredu ed to a value near the Z-resonan e (so- alled radiative return events). The emission of ISR\nphotons happens predominantly at small polar angles. In ase of a mismeasurement or es ape\nof the ISR photons through the beam pipe these events have a sizeable missing momentum\npreferentially oriented at small polar angles, lose to the beam pipe. In su h events the two jets\nare almost oplanar.\nThe most di\u001e ult ba kground to separate is four-fermion pro esses with neutrinos in the\n\u001cnal state, su h as W+ W\u2212 \u2192 l\u00b1 \u03bd qq\u0304 and W \u00b1 e\u2213 \u03bd \u2192 qq\u0304e\u2213 \u03bd with the harged lepton es aping\ndete tion. The irredu ible ba kground to this sear h stems from ZZ \u2192 \u03bd\u03bdqq\u0304 (about 28 % of all\nZZ de ays) leading to a signature indistinguishable from a signal event with a Higgs mass lose\nto the Z boson mass. The ve tor bosons are usually not produ ed at rest, leading to a transverse\nmomentum of the two-jet system and therefore to a large a oplanarity of the jets, as in the signal\nase. Furthermore, the missing momentum ve tor points into the entral dete tor more often\nthan for the two-fermion ase. To dis riminate between this ba kground and the signal one an\nexploit the di\u001beren e in the angular distribution of the di\u001berential produ tion ross-se tion.\n\n4.2 Presele tion\nIn order to redu e the amount of ba kground data only a events ful\u001clling the following quality\nriteria are analysed. From ut No.(5) onwards, the ut values were de\u001cned using as a guide\na simple \u001cgure of merit based on the e\u001e ien y and expe ted ba kground. The following uts\nremove almost all the two-photon ba kground:\n(1) To redu e two-photon and a elerator indu ed ba kground, tra k riteria are applied demanding that more than 20 % of all tra ks be quali\u001ced as good measured tra ks [24\u2104 and\nthat at least 6 of them be found.\n(2) A forward energy veto reje ts events with more than 5 GeV in either the left or right\nompartment of the gamma at her alorimeters or the sili on tungsten luminometers.\nEvents with more than 2 GeV in the forward alorimeters are also removed.\n(3) The missing transverse momentum pT\nMIS should ex eed 1 GeV and MVIS has to be larger\nthan 4 GeV.\n(4) Less than 20 % of the measured visible energy EVIS should be lo ated lose to the beam\npipe in the region | cos \u03b8| > 0.9.\n(5) The visible energy EVIS must be less than 90 % of\n\n\u221a\ns.\n\n(6) It is required that the visible mass of the event should be of order MZ , i.e. 55 GeV <\nMVIS < 105 GeV. An asymmetri ut around the Z mass is hosen, sin e with in reasing\nHiggs mass MH the Z bosons will be more and more o\u001b-shell.\nThe remaining ba kgrounds at this stage, whi h are more di\u001e ult to remove, are mismeasured\nZ/\u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 qq\u0304 events, four-fermion pro esses with neutrinos in the \u001cnal state, su h as W+ W\u2212 \u2192\nl\u00b1 \u03bdqq\u0304 and W \u00b1 e\u2213 \u03bd \u2192 qq\u0304e\u2213 \u03bd with the harged lepton es aping dete tion (see Table 2).\n\n8\n\n\f(7) To sele t events that are well measured in the dete tor with a visible mass MVIS lose to\nMZ and a sizeable transverse momentum pTVIS the following riterion is applied: MVIS +\n\n5 \u00d7 pTVIS >\n\n\u221a\n\ns/2\n\n(8) A large part of the qq\u0304 events and the remaining two-photon ba kground is eliminated by\nrequiring the visible transverse momentum pT\nVIS > 6 GeV.\n(9) To remove ba kgrounds in whi h parti les go undete ted down the beam pipe, the proje tion of the visible momentum along the beam axis, pzVIS , is required to be less than\n\u221a\n0.294 s.\n(10) To redu e the radiative qq\u0304(\u03b3 ) ba kground, the polar angle of the missing momentum ve tor\nmust lie within the region | cos \u03b8MIS | < 0.9.\n(11) The axes of both jets, re onstru ted with the Durham algorithm, are required to have\na polar angle satisfying | cos \u03b8| < 0.9 to ensure good ontainment. Furthermore this ut\nexploits the fa t that events of the WW and ZZ ba kground are produ ed a ording to an\nangular distribution proportional to cos2 \u03b8 .\n(12) The remaining ba kground from Z/\u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 qq\u0304 is hara terised by two jets that tend to be\nba k-to-ba k with small a oplanarity angles, in ontrast to signal events in whi h the jets\nare expe ted to have some a oplanarity angle due to the re oiling Higgs boson. Here the\na oplanarity angle \u03c6ACOPLAN is de\u001cned as 180\u25e6 \u2212 \u03c6jj where \u03c6jj is the angle between the\ntwo jets in the plane perpendi ular to the beam axis. This ba kground is suppressed by\nrequiring that the jet-jet a oplanarity angle be larger than 5\u25e6 .\n(13) W+ W\u2212 events with one of the W bosons de aying leptoni ally and the other de aying\ninto hadroni jets are reje ted by requiring that the events have no isolated leptons. In\nthis ontext, leptons are low-multipli ity jets with one, two or three tra ks, asso iated to\nele tromagneti or hadroni energy lusters, having an invariant mass of less than 2.5 GeV\nand momentum in ex ess of 5 GeV. In the ase of a single-tra k andidate, the lepton is\nonsidered isolated if there are no additional tra ks within an isolation one of 25\u25e6 halfangle, and if the ele tromagneti energy ontained between ones of 5\u25e6 and 25\u25e6 half-angle\naround the tra k does not ex eed 5 % of the sum of the tra k energy and the ele tromagneti\nenergy within the 5\u25e6 half angle one. In the ase of a two- or three-tra k andidate,\nonsisting of the tra ks and ele tromagneti or hadroni energy lusters on\u001cned to a one\nof 7\u25e6 half-angle, the lepton is onsidered isolated if the sum of tra k and ele tromagneti\nenergy between the 7\u25e6 half-angle one and a 25\u25e6 half-angle isolation one does not ex eed\n15 % of the lepton energy.\nFor ea h individual entre-of-mass energy there is good agreement between the numbers of expe ted ba kground events and observed andidates after the presele tion. Table 2 gives the\nnumber of presele ted events summed over all entre-of-mass energies. Figure 1 shows the distributions for ba kground lasses summed over all entre-of-mass energies and three arbitrarily\ns aled signal distributions (at a entre-of-mass energy of 206 GeV). The e\u001e ien ies of the presele tion vary on average between 39 % and 55 % for small de ay widths and between 45 % and\n53 % for larger de ay widths above \u0393H = 100 GeV.\n\n4.3 Likelihood analysis\nTo onsider the hanging kinemati properties of the signal hypotheses in an optimal way, \u001cve\ndi\u001berent likelihood-based analyses for the signal and ba kground dis rimination were applied\nafter the presele tion. By a likelihood analysis we denote the ombination of a set of likelihood\n9\n\n\finput variables, a so- alled likelihood, and the orresponding referen e distributions of these\nvariables. The referen e distributions are \u001clled with events of the spe i\u001c lasses for whi h the\nlikelihood is al ulated. The lasses onsidered in this sear h are the two- and four-fermion\nba kgrounds and the signal events. The two-photon events are negligible after the presele tion.\nThe sear h uses ombinations of two likelihoods and three \u001cxed signal mass ranges for unweighted\nreferen e histograms.\nTo ompare the kinemati properties of a sele ted data event to the hypothesis (MH ,\u0393H )\nwhen evaluating the likelihood, one in prin iple has to \u001cll weighted signal referen e distributions\nfor ea h hypothesis (MH ,\u0393H ). This will soon lead to an unmanageable te hni al e\u001bort, given the\nnumber of hypotheses s anned. Therefore a ompromise was sought in whi h ertain kinemati\nproperties of the signal were emphasised and simultaneously the number of referen e histograms\nkept small. This was a hieved by \u001clling unweighted signal referen e histograms. For most of the\n(MH ,\u0393H ) hypotheses all signal masses were used for \u001clling the referen e histograms. This re\u001de ts\nthe fa t that for a very large de ay width of the Higgs boson the possible values of kinemati al\nvariables are also smeared out over a large range. It was, however, found that the sensitivity of\nthe likelihood sele tion (i.e. the median expe ted upper limits on \u03c3(MH , \u0393H ) \u00d7 BR(H \u2192 EMIS ))\nould be in reased further for small widths below 50 GeV by \u001clling referen e histograms with\nsignal masses from 50-80 GeV and from 80-120 GeV for intermediate and heavy Higgs boson\nmasses respe tively. A \u001crst likelihood was designed for a signal onsisting of small masses (MH\n< 80 GeV) or large masses and a very large width (\u0393H \u2265 110 GeV). In this likelihood input\nvariables are used exploiting the hara teristi s of the dominant fra tion of light masses in the\nsignal mass distribution. However for signal masses above MH = 80 GeV and small or moderate\n(i.e. below 110 GeV) de ay widths, the ontribution of large masses dominates the signal mass\ndistribution. In this ase the kinemati s and topology of the signal events are determined by\nthe higher masses lose to the kinemati limit. A se ond likelihood is therefore built with input\nvariables optimised for su h signal hara teristi s. In the following the hoi e of the inputs for\nthe two optimised likelihoods are presented.\nThe \u001crst three input variables are used in both likelihoods (see Figure 3) .\n(1) (1 + P(MVIS \u2261 MZ ))\u22121\nP(MVIS \u2261 MZ ) is the probability of a kinemati al \u03c72 \u001ct of the jet four-ve tors under the\nassumption that the invariant mass of the two jets is ompatible with the Z boson mass.\nThe un ertainties on the measured jet energies are of the order of 5-10 GeV, while the jet\ndire tions are measured to approximately 1-2\u25e6 [25\u2104. This variable depends only weakly on\nthe Higgs mass. For events with non- onverging \u001ct the probability is set to zero. They\ntherefore a umulate at a value of 1.\n(2) \u2212 log y32\nThe Durham algorithm groups two energy \u001dow obje ts i and j into a jet as long as their\n2\nis smaller then the\nseparation in phase spa e yij = 2 \u00d7 min(Ei2 , Ej2 ) \u00d7 (1 \u2212 cos(\u03b8ij )/EVIS\nut value ycut . The number of jets in a event is prede\u001cned to be 2, y32 is the value of ycut\nwhere the two-jet topology of the event hanges to a three-jet topology. Hen e the negative\nlogarithm of the so- alled jet resolution parameter y32 is a measure for the jet topology\nbeing more two-jet like (large value of \u2212 log y32 ) or three-jet like (small value of \u2212 log y32 ).\n\n\u221a\n\n(3) pT\nMIS / s\nThe transverse missing momentum pT\nMIS is one of the most prominent hara teristi s of\nsignal-like events, but depends very mu h on the Higgs boson mass. For a heavy Higgs\nboson produ ed lose to the kinemati threshold almost at rest, the Z boson has almost no\nboost and de ays into two more or less ba k-to-ba k jets. In this ase the dis riminating\npower of the variable is lost.\n10\n\n\fThe next three variables (see Figure 4) omplete the \u001crst likelihood, whi h is used for all Higgs\nmasses in the domain of very large width > 110 GeV or low Higgs masses < 80 GeV.\n(4) \u03c6ACOL\nThe a olinearity angle \u03c6ACOL of the two-jet system is obtained by subtra ting the threedimensional angle between the re onstru ted jet-axes from 180\u25e6 . Events ontaining a lowmass Higgs boson exhibit on average a larger a olinearity than the ba kground.\n(5) | cos \u03b8 \u2217 |\nThe Gottfried-Ja kson angle \u03b8 \u2217 , is de\u001cned as the angle between the \u001dight dire tion of the\nZ boson in the laboratory frame and the dire tion of the de ay produ ts of the Z boson\nboosted into the Z boson rest-frame. The variable tends to have smaller values for the\nsignal.\n(6) \u2212 log y21\nThe variable \u2212 log y21 is analogous to \u2212 log y32 and measures the ompatibility of the event\nwith a two-jet topology. Two-jet events tend to a umulate at small values of \u2212 log y21 .\nThe last three variables (see Figure 5) tune the se ond likelihood to be ome more sensitive for\nlarge Higgs boson masses and small to moderate widths.\n\n\u221a\n\nMax / s\n(7) EJET\nMax measures the energy of the most energeti of the two jets. This is on\nThe variable EJET\naverage higher for the four-fermion ba kground, due to the boost of the W and Z pairs,\nwhereas heavy Higgs bosons and a Z boson are produ ed at rest.\n\n(8) RPti\nThis variable is the signi\u001c an e of the a oplanarity between the two jets, taking into a ount\ndete tor resolution and a eptan e. The dis rimination power is enhan ed by weighting\nthe a oplanarity with the average jet polar angle, sin e transverse jet dire tions are more\npre isely measured at large polar angles. Signal events tend to have a more signi\u001c ant\na oplanarity and thus larger values of RPti than ba kground. The pre ise de\u001cnition of RPti\nan be found in the OPAL analyses of ZZ \u2192 qq\u03bd\u03bd events [26\u2104.\n(9) (MVIS + MMIS )/(MVIS \u2212 MMIS )\nThis variable, des ribed in [27\u2104, uses two strongly orrelated quantities, the invariant missing mass MMIS and the visible mass of the event MVIS . Depending on the mass re onstru tion a ura y it an have positive or negative values. The signal distribution of this\nvariable is broader and a umulates at higher values than for the two- and four-fermion\nevents, whi h are distributed more narrowly around the origin.\nFrom the two likelihoods and three ranges of signal masses \u001clled in the referen e histograms\none has six analyses to sear h for the di\u001berent hypotheses in MH and \u0393H . The study of the\nmedian expe ted \u03c3(MH , \u0393H ) \u00d7 BR(H \u2192 EMIS ) shows that \u001cve of these six are su\u001e ient to have\nan optimally e\u001e ient analysis for ea h signal hypothesis hara terised by MH and \u0393H (see Figure\n2) in the range studied. Likelihood 1 was not used with the referen e distribution \u001clled for the\nsignal mass range of 80 to 120 GeV. Figure 6 a) to ) and g) to h) display examples for the\nlikelihood distributions of all \u001cve analyses used. In the histograms the events sele ted at all\n\u001cve entre-of-mass energies are added up, although ea h entre-of-mass energy was evaluated\nseparately in the limit setting as explained in Se tion 5.1. The appropriate likelihood was alulated for ea h ba kground, data and signal event. In ase of a signal event it was added to\nthe histogram with the weight de\u001cned in Equation 7. The number of expe ted signal events is\n11\n\n\fnormalised a ording to Equation 6. The use of di\u001berent analyses gives rise to varying shapes of\nthe likelihood distributions of the ba kground. Also the various shapes of the signal likelihood\ndistributions are visible for di\u001berent MH and \u0393H . Sin e the form of the likelihood distributions\nfor signal and ba kground an yield additional information in the limit al ulation, only a loose\nut is applied in the likelihood sele tion, requiring a signal likelihood larger than 0.2.\n\n4.4 Corre tion of ba kground and signal e\u001e ien ies\nA orre tion is applied to the number of expe ted ba kground events and the signal e\u001e ien ies\ndue to noise in the dete tors in the forward region whi h is not modelled by the Monte Carlo.\nThe forward energy veto used in the presele tion an a identally be triggered by ma hine ba kgrounds. The orre tion fa tor is derived from the study of random beam rossings, and applied\nindividually for ea h year of data taking. Random beam rossing events were re orded when no\nphysi s trigger was a tive. The fra tion of events that fail the veto on a tivity in the forward\nregion is below 3.4 % for all runs analysed. The detailed breakdown of the fra tion of a identally\nvetoed events is given in the last olumn of Table 1.\n\n4.5 Systemati un ertainties\nA possible signal in the data would reveal itself by altering the shapes of the distributions of\nthe dis riminating variables. Thus a systemati deviation in the des ription of a re onstru ted\nobservable between Standard Model Monte Carlo and a data sample in whi h the signal is absent,\nould wrongly be attributed to the presen e of a signal.\nThe systemati un ertainties in the Monte Carlo des ription of the kinemati event variables\nare studied in two ontrol samples at a entre-of-mass energy of 206 GeV. In the \u001crst ontrol\nsample, alled two-fermion ontrol-sample in the following, radiative returns ontributing to the\nqq\u0304(\u03b3) pro esses with photons dete ted at large angles are sele ted and the tagged ISR photon is\nremoved from the event in Monte Carlo and data. This reates a qq\u0304-like topology with missing\nmomentum at large angles. The se ond ontrol sample, alled four-fermion ontrol-sample, is\nobtained by sele ting W+ W\u2212 \u2192 qq\u0304l\u03bd events and removing the identi\u001ced isolated lepton from\nthe events in Monte Carlo and data. After this pro edure these two ontrol samples possess a\ntopology very similar to signal events. For all kinemati variables x of the presele tion and the\nlikelihood sele tion the mean x and the width of the distribution (RM S ) are ompared between\nMonte Carlo and data, for the two-fermion and four-fermion ontrol-samples. The observables\nin the two-fermion and four-fermion Monte Carlo are then modi\u001ced separately a ording to\nRM SDATA\nxNEW\n= (xOLD\nMC\nMC \u2212 xMC ) \u00d7 RM SMC + xDATA . Then all \u001cve likelihood sele tions are repeated\nseparately and the relative hange in the number of sele ted events ompared to the unmodi\u001ced\nase is taken as the systemati un ertainty.\nSin e the analysis labelled A1 in Table 3 is used over a large range of the sear h plane\n(see Figure 2), the systemati un ertainties on the ba kground determined in this analysis A1\nare taken as an estimate for the ba kground for all analyses. To determine the e\u001be t of the\nsystemati un ertainty on the signal e\u001e ien ies, one has to take into a ount the fa t that\nthe kinemati properties of the signal depend on the assumed Higgs mass and de ay width.\nTwelve representative hypotheses are studied with MH hosen to be 20, 60 or 110 GeV and\n\u0393H taking values of 5, 20, 70 and 200 GeV. For these hypotheses the signal Monte Carlo is\nmodi\u001ced a ording to the four-fermion orre tion fa tors, representing the dominant remaining\nba kground after the ut on the signal likelihood. The relative hange in sele ted event weights\nompared to the unmodi\u001ced ase is then taken as an estimate of the systemati un ertainty on\nthe signal e\u001e ien y for a given hypothesis. The root-mean-square of all twelve hypotheses is\napplied as an (MH ,\u0393H )-independent estimate for the whole sear h area and for all entre-of-mass\nenergies (see Table 4).\n12\n\n\fThe W pairs are very e\u001be tively redu ed in the presele tion by the isolated lepton veto. Due\nto the importan e of this veto the un ertainty from the lepton isolation angle and the vetoed one\nenergy is studied in the following way. The half- one angle of the outer one is in reased and\nde reased by two degrees, following the studies in [28\u2104, and the relative e\u001be t on the sele tion\ndetermined. Furthermore the one energy is varied by 7.4 % and the analyses are repeated.\nThe value of the one energy res aling is determined by the relative deviation of the mean of the\nmeasured energy of the lepton andidates in the inner one between data and Monte Carlo in the\nW+ W\u2212 \u2192 qq\u0304l\u03bd sample. For signal e\u001e ien ies an analogous study was performed at the twelve\npoints des ribed above. Both results for the relative hange of the sele tion for the one opening\nhalf-angle and one energy variation are added in quadrature and the root-mean-square of the 12\n(MH ,\u0393H ) hypotheses was taken to yield the total un ertainty asso iated with the isolated lepton\nveto (see Table 4).\nThe theoreti al predi tion on the ross-se tion for the two- and four-fermion pro esses adds\nan un ertainty of 2 % to the ba kground un ertainty [29\u2104. Finally, the un ertainty due to the\nlimited Monte Carlo statisti s is evaluated.\nTable 5 summarises the results of the studies. All un ertainties are assumed to be un orrelated and the individual ontributions are added in quadrature to obtain the total systemati\nun ertainties on the ba kground expe tation and signal e\u001e ien y. The dominant systemati\nun ertainties on the signal e\u001e ien y arise from the des ription of the kinemati variables. The\nba kground expe tation is more a\u001be ted by the un ertainty in the isolated lepton veto, as the\nmain ontribution of the ba kground stems from four-fermion pro esses. But the un ertainty\nasso iated with the des ription of the kinemati variables is of similar magnitude. The limits\nquoted in Se tion 5.1 were al ulated in luding the un ertainties of Table 5. To estimate the\nextent to whi h the limits depend on the size of the systemati un ertainties, the limit al ulation\nwas repeated doubling the systemati un ertainties. A omparison of the limits with single and\ndouble systemati un ertainties, done at similar representative points as used for the systemati\nstudies, showed that the ex luded ross-se tions typi ally de rease between a half and one and\na half per ent. A maximal redu tion of 2.1 % was found.\n\n5 Results\nThe results of the sear h using ea h of the \u001cve di\u001berent likelihood sele tions, labelled A1-A5, after\na ut on the likelihood larger than 0.2 are summarised in Table 6, whi h ompares the numbers of\nobserved andidates with the Standard Model ba kground expe tations. The data are ompatible\nwith the Standard Model ba kground expe tations. The remaining four-fermion ba kground\nonsists predominantly of W pairs, representing roughly three quarters of the ba kground at\nenergies above the Z pair threshold. Figure 7 shows examples for signal e\u001e ien ies. For small\nde ay widths the dependen e on the entre-of-mass energy is weak up to MH \u2248 80 GeV, and\nfor large widths it is weak up to the kinemati limit. Be ause of the entre-of-mass energy\ndependen e of the Bjorken ross-se tion of a Higgs boson with mass MH , the lower entre-ofmass energies ontribute more signi\u001c antly to the sensitivity for lighter Higgs bosons (see e.g.\nin [8\u2104). For very light Higgs bosons the e\u001e ien y is moderately redu ed by the presele tion uts\ndemanding a sizeable amount of missing energy. In the ase of broader Higgs resonan es with\nhigh mass, one observes a generally enhan ed e\u001e ien y sin e the han e of sele ting events from\nthe low mass tail ompensates the suppression due to the falling produ tion ross-se tion of a\nheavy Higgs boson.\n\n13\n\n\f5.1 The upper limits on the produ tion ross-se tion times bran hing ratio\nUpper limits are al ulated on the model-independent ross-se tion \u03c3(MH , \u0393H ) \u00d7 BR(H \u2192 EMIS )\n\u221a\ns aled to s = 206 GeV. As the likelihood distributions are only loosely ut, one an use not\nonly the information from the integral number of sele ted events (Table 6) but also from the\nshape in a likelihood ratio [30\u2104 to set more sensitive upper limits. For ea h entre-of-mass energy\nseparately, ea h bin with a signal likelihood larger than 0.2 in the distributions of expe ted\nsignal, ba kground and sele ted data is treated as a sear h hannel. For ea h entre-of-mass\nenergy the number of expe ted signal events is s aled to the total ross-se tion (Equation 6). As\nwith the analysis des ribed in [31\u2104, the likelihood distributions are given as dis riminating input\nto a limit program [32\u2104. A likelihood ratio is used to determine the signal on\u001cden e level, CLS ,\nde\u001cned in [30, 32\u2104, whi h ex ludes the presen e of a possible signal a ording to the modi\u001ced\nfrequentist approa h [32\u2104. Additionally the program al ulates the median upper number of\nsignal events that ould be ex luded at 95 % on\u001cden e level (CL). This number is then s aled\nto the total ross-se tion at the entre-of-mass energy of 206 GeV for ea h (MH ,\u0393H ) hypothesis.\nThe systemati un ertainties on the ba kground expe tations and signal sele tion e\u001e ien ies are\nin luded a ording a generalisation of the method des ribed in [33\u2104.\nA very \u001cne s an of the (MH ,\u0393H )-plane was performed by simulating the spe tra of Higgs\nbosons with a mass MH from 1 to 120 GeV and widths \u0393H starting at 1 GeV up to 3 TeV. The\nHiggs boson mass was simulated in steps of \u03b4MH = 1 GeV. Simulated values of \u0393H are spa ed\nin steps of 1 GeV up to 5 GeV. A spa ing of \u03b4\u0393H = 5 GeV is hosen from \u0393H = 5 GeV to \u0393H =\n750 GeV. Above this value steps of \u03b4\u0393H = 50 GeV are adopted up to the maximal \u0393H of 3 TeV.\nExamples of the proje tions of the observed upper ross-se tion limits together with the\nmedian expe ted upper limits and the orresponding one and two standard deviation bands\non the expe ted limits are displayed in Figure 8 for some hoi es of \u0393H . Above a width of\n300 GeV the ex lusion plots look quite similar to the example displayed in Figure 8i) be ause\nthe ex luded limits do not hange very mu h. The observed limits for \u0393H & 60 GeV are well\nontained in the one standard deviation bands on the expe tations and generally do not ex eed\ntwo standard deviations ex ept in Figure 8 a) at MH = 114 GeV. The dis ontinuities in the\ngraphs orrespond to hanges in the analyses. As one an observe, below \u0393H . 40 GeV the\nanalysis are hanged more often. Therefore the han e is higher that in a few bins there are\nstatisti al \u001du tuations in the sele ted data, that lead to a deviation of more than one standard\ndeviation around the median. Also the data sele ted are highly orrelated, as one an see for\nexample in the upward \u001du tuation around MH = 114 GeV visible in Figure 8 a)- ). All results\nfor the observed upper limits on \u03c3(MH , \u0393H ) \u00d7 BR(H \u2192 EMIS ) are summarised in a ontour plot\n(Figure 9) in the s anned (MH ,\u0393H )-plane. Above \u0393H = 200 GeV the observed upper limits are\nin the range of 0.15 pb to 0.18 pb for all MH and vary very little. For su h large \u0393H the re oil\nmass distribution of the Higgs tends to be more and more uniformly stret hed out over the mass\nrange explored. There is not mu h di\u001beren e in the sele tion of signal events for a Higgs boson\nwith e.g. a width of 400 GeV or 600 GeV in the onsidered range of Higgs masses. This prevents\nany spe i\u001c dis riminating kinemati al properties from being assigned to the expe ted signal as\nsignal masses of a broad kinemati al range are sele ted with roughly equal probability. Therefore\nonly one likelihood analysis is used in this part of the sear h area, sele ting the same subset of\ndata and ba kground. Sin e the upper limit on the model-independent ross-se tion refers to a\nprodu tion ross-se tion at a entre-of-mass energy of 206 GeV, it must be ome independent of\n(MH ,\u0393H ) for an extremely large \u0393H . In this ase the shape of the Higgs signal would just be\na box, weighted with the produ tion ross-se tion from 1 GeV to the kinemati limit of about\n115 GeV. The data are then ompared to an approximately onstant signal expe tation. Hen e\nthe upper limit on the ross-se tion is approximately independent of the (MH ,\u0393H ) hypothesis at\na value of roughly 0.16 pb. For resonan es with a de ay width smaller than 200 GeV there are\n\n14\n\n\fregions where the limits are below 0.15 pb or even 0.1 pb for MH between 60 and 74 GeV. In this\nmass range the number of data events sele ted is smaller than expe ted. Above MH of 85 GeV\nthe upper limits be ome larger than 0.2 pb and rise onsiderably for small widths below 40 GeV\n(see Figure 8 a-e). This is due to the fa t that the Higgs mass approa hes the kinemati limit\nand the likelihoods whi h rely on kinemati al variables like pT\nMIS lose dis rimination power. A\nmaximal value of 0.57 pb is observed for MH of 114 GeV and \u0393H of 1 GeV orresponding to a\nir a two-\u03c3 ex ess in the data.\nIt should be kept in mind that no optimisation of the sear h has been performed for \u0393H\nbelow 5 GeV. In the region of heavy Higgs boson mass & 105 GeV and small width a sear h\nusing re oil mass spe tra would be more sensitive. Therefore this region is more sensitively\novered by sear hes that have been performed by the LEP experiments do umented in [2\u2104.\n\n5.2 Interpretation of the result in the stealthy Higgs s enario\nInterpreting the width \u0393H of a Higgs boson a ording to Equation 5, and setting mphion to zero,\nit was possible to set limits on \u03c9 in the stealthy Higgs s enario. A range from \u03c9 = 0.04 to\n\u03c9 = 24.45 was probed. The ex luded regions are shown in Figure 10 at 95 % on\u001cden e level\n(CL) in the \u03c9 -MH parameter spa e. To illustrate the Higgs boson width a ording to Equation 5,\nontours of \u001cxed \u0393H orresponding to a given mass MH and oupling \u03c9 are added to the plot.\nThe maximum ex luded invisible width is about \u0393H = 400 GeV for Higgs boson masses . 35 GeV,\nde reasing slowly to \u0393H = 115 GeV for MH = 100 GeV. The minimal ex lusion of \u03c9 = 0.04 is\nobserved at MH = 1 GeV and the maximal ex lusion is \u03c9 = 5.9 for MH = 73 GeV. For \u03c9 between\n0.04 and 0.59 a Higgs mass from 1 to 103 GeV ould be ex luded. The maximal ex luded Higgs\nmass was 103 GeV for width between 1 and 3 GeV, ompared with the expe ted ex lusion of\n106 GeV.\nThe results presented in this study extend the previous de ay-mode independent sear hes\nfor new s alar bosons with the OPAL dete tor [5\u2104 to regions of larger ouplings and higher\nHiggs boson masses. In [5\u2104 an interpretation within the stealthy Higgs model yielded a maximal\nex luded oupling \u03c9 for masses around 30 GeV, where \u03c9 was ex luded up to \u03c9 = 2.7. That study\nex luded Higgs boson masses up to MH = 81 GeV. It should be pointed out that the de ay-mode\nindependent sear hes also studied Higgs widths between 0.1 and 1 GeV and therefore over the\ngap between sear hes within s enarios assuming a narrow de ay width of the invisibly de aying\nHiggs boson [2\u2104 and the sear h presented in this paper up to MH = 81 GeV.\n\n6 Con lusions\nA dedi ated sear h was performed in the hannel e+ e\u2212 \u2192 HZ with Z \u2192 qq\u0304 and the nonStandard Model de ay H \u2192 EMIS \u001cnal state allowing for invisible de ay widths of the Higgs\nboson from 1 GeV up to 3 TeV. The data taken by the OPAL dete tor at LEP above the W\npair threshold were analysed. No indi ation for a signal was found and upper limits were set on\n\u03c3(MH , \u0393H ) \u00d7 BR(H \u2192 EMIS ). The maximal upper limit is 0.57 pb at MH = 114 GeV and \u0393H =\n1 GeV. Over the s anned region of the (MH ,\u0393H )-plane upper limits are generally of the order of\n0.15 pb, espe ially for large values of \u0393H & 400 GeV or Higgs boson masses . 85 GeV.\nThe limits were interpreted in the stealthy Higgs s enario assuming the presen e of a large\nnumber of massless singlet states. Limits were al ulated on the oupling \u03c9 to a hidden s alar\nse tor of the Higgs boson with a given mass MH . A large part of the parameter plane kinematially a essible with LEP 2 was ex luded extending a previous ex lusion published in [5\u2104. Values\nfor \u03c9 between 0.04 (MH = 1 GeV) and 5.9 (MH = 73 GeV) were ex luded, and for ertain values\nof \u03c9 Higgs boson masses are ex luded up to MH = 103 GeV. The possible non-dete tion of a\n\n15\n\n\flight Higgs boson at the LEP sear hes due to non-Standard Model invisible Higgs boson de ays\nis therefore restri ted to the ase of extremely large de ay widths & 400 GeV.\n\nA knowledgements\nWe parti ularly wish to thank the SL Division for the e\u001e ient operation of the LEP a elerator\nat all energies and for their lose ooperation with our experimental group.

A signal in the range of 80 to 90 GeV su\u001bers from a drop in\nthe e\u001e ien y due to the relatively large remaining W- and Z-pair ba kgrounds. For a smaller\nwidths \u0393H the e\u001e ien y to dete t a relatively heavy (above\n100 GeV) and more Standard Model\n\u221a\nlike Higgs boson is more restri ted by the available s. For a large \u0393H signal hypothesis, the\nkinemati distributions of events and the distribution of weights assigned to these events are\nbroader. Therefore it is more likely to sele t a larger fra tion of the event weights leading to\nmore uniform e\u001e ien y, that does not depend very mu h on the entre-of-mass energy.\nFigure 7:\n\n27\n\n\f0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n\n0.7\n0.6\n\nb) \u0393H= 5 GeV\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100 120\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n0.6\n\nd) \u0393H= 20 GeV\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n\n100 120\n\n0\n\n0.7\n0.6\n\ne) \u0393H= 40 GeV\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n\n0.7\n0.6\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n100 120\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n0.7\n0.6\n\ng) \u0393H= 100 GeV\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n\n100 120\n\n0\n\n0.7\n0.6\n\nh) \u0393H= 200 GeV\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n40\n\n60\n\n100 120\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\nMH (GeV)\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100 120\n\nMH (GeV)\n\n80\n\n100 120\n\ni) \u0393H= 300 GeV\n\n1 standard deviation\n2 standard deviations\nmedian exp. \u03c3prod \u00d7 BRinv\nOPAL \u03c3prod \u00d7 BRinv\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n20\n\n20\n\nMH (GeV)\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\nf) \u0393H= 60 GeV\n\nMH (GeV)\n\u03c3prod \u00d7 BRinv (pb)\n\nMH (GeV)\n\n80\n\n\u03c3prod \u00d7 BRinv (pb)\n\n80\n\n100 120\n\n0.3\n\n0.1\n60\n\n80\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n40\n\n60\n\n0.5\n\n0.2\n\n20\n\n40\n\nMH (GeV)\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n20\n\nMH (GeV)\n\u03c3prod \u00d7 BRinv (pb)\n\n0.7\n\n80\n\n\u03c3prod \u00d7 BRinv (pb)\n\n20\n\nc) \u0393H= 10 GeV\n\n0.5\n\n0.2\n\nMH (GeV)\n\u03c3prod \u00d7 BRinv (pb)\n\n0.7\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n\u03c3prod \u00d7 BRinv (pb)\n\n\u03c3prod \u00d7 BRinv (pb)\n\n0.6\n\na) \u0393H= 1 GeV\n\n\u03c3prod \u00d7 BRinv (pb)\n\n\u03c3prod \u00d7 BRinv (pb)\n\n0.7\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100 120\n\nMH (GeV)\n\nFigure 8: The model independent upper limits at 95 % CL on the produ tion ross-se tion times\nbran hing ratio, \u03c3prod \u00d7 BRinv , s aled to a entre-of-mass energy of 206 GeV for Higgs mass MH\nand some examples of the Higgs de ay width \u0393H .
