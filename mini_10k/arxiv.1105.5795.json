Introduction\nDenoting by \u2206n (x) the Vandermonde determinant in the variables x = x1 , . . . , xn , we\nconsider the spaces\nDn;f := L\u2202,E [f (x)\u2206n (x)],\n(1)\nwhere f (x) is a symmetric polynomial in the x-variables. Here, for a polynomial p(x),\nwe denote by L\u2202,E [p(x] the smallest vector space1 (say over Q) that contains p(x) and is\nclosed under taking partial derivatives, as well as applications of the operators\nn\nX\n(k)\nEuv\n:=\nui \u2202vi k ,\n(2)\ni=1\n\nwhere u and v stand for any two of r sets of n variables:\nx = x1 , . . . , xn ,\n\ny = y1 , . . . , yn ,\n\nz = z1 , . . . , zn ,\n\netc.\n\nThe symmetric group Sn acts on Dn;f by diagonal permutation of the various variable\nsets u, sending ui to u\u03c3(i) , for \u03c3 \u2208 Sn . Although we restrict most of our discussion to\nthe case of two sets of variables, Proposition 1 holds in the more general context. It is\neasy to show that Dn is a subspace of the space of diagonal harmonics. It is in fact the\nwhole space for one (classical) and two (see [12]) sets of variables, and it seems to be so\nin general. For more on the case of 3 or more sets of variables, see [2, 6].\n1The\n\nrelated spaces L\u2202 [f (x)\u2206n (x)] (with no application of the E-operators) are studied in [4].\n1\n\n\f2\n\nF. BERGERON\n\nThe spaces Dn;f are graded by the (vector) degree\ndeg(f ) := (degx (f ), degy (f ), degz (f ), . . .),\n\n(3)\n\nand the action of Sn respects this grading, thus Dn;f is a graded Sn -module. Recall that,\nfor a (vector-degree) graded Sn -module\nM\nVd ,\nV=\nd\u2208Nr\n\nthe coefficients of the Frobenius characteristic (here denoted by V(w; q)), in the Schur\nbasis of the S\u03bc (w), correspond to (graded) multiplicities of irreducibles in the Sn -module\nV. This is to say that\nX\nV(w; q) =\nq1d1 q2d2 * * * qrdr Vd (w),\nd=(d1 ,d2 ,...,dr )\n\nwith\nVd (w) =\n\nX\n\na\u03bc;d S\u03bc (w),\n\n\u03bc\u22a2n\n\nwhere a\u03bc;q is the multiplicity of the irreducible accounted for S\u03bc (w) in the homogeneous\ncomponent Vd of degree d. Observe that the fact that V is graded over Nr is encoded\nby the number of variables considered in q.\nWhen f (x) is a Schur function s\u03bc (x), we write Dn;\u03bc for Dn;f . To clarify any possible\nresulting ambiguity, let us agree that for f (x) = s0 (x) = 1, we denote by Dn the resulting\nspace. Our first objective here is to relate the Frobenius Dn;k (w; q) to conjectures of [5]\nconcerning an operator \u2207 on symmetric functions. This operator is defined below in\nterms of Macdonald operators. On the way, we also deduce new identities concerning\nthis operator \u2207 and some of its generalizations.\n2. Macdonald polynomials and the \u2207 operator\nMacdonald polynomials. To go on with our story, we need to recall some basic facts\nabout Macdonald polynomials and operators for which they are common eigenfunctions.\nAs usual (see [16]), we denote by \u03bb \u0016 \u03bc the dominance order on partitions. This is\nthe (partial) order characterized by the fact that\n\u03bb1 + \u03bb2 + * * * + \u03bbk \u2264 \u03bc 1 + \u03bc 2 + * * * + \u03bc k ,\n\nfor all\n\nk \u2265 1,\n\nsetting \u03bci = 0 or \u03bbi = 0, whenever i is larger than the number of parts of the underlying\npartition. Also as usual, \u03bc\u2032 stands for the conjugate partition of \u03bc.\nRecall that the integral form Macdonald polynomials H\u03bc (w; q, t), with \u03bc a partition\nof n (we write \u03bc \u22a2 n), expand in the Schur function basis as\nX\nK\u03bb,\u03bc (q, t) S\u03bb(w).\nH\u03bc (w; q, t) =\n(4)\n\u03bb\u22a2n\n\n\fPRELIMINARY VERSION\n\n3\n\nThe coefficients K\u03bb,\u03bc (q, t) are known as the q, t-Kostka polynomials. They have been\nshown, in [12], to have positive integer coefficients. They form a linear basis of the ring\n\u039b, of symmetric functions in the variables w, and are characterized by the equations\n(i) hS\u03bb (w), H\u03bc[(1 \u2212 q) w; q, t]i = 0,\n\nif\n\n\u03bb 6\u0017 \u03bc,\n\n(ii) hS\u03bb (w), H\u03bc [(1 \u2212 t) w; q, t]i = 0,\n\nif\n\n\u03bb 6\u0017 \u03bc\u2032 , and\n\n(5)\n\n(iii) hSn (w), H\u03bc(w; q, t)i = 1,\ninvolving the usual \"Hall\" scalar product on symmetric functions (for which the Schur\nfunctions are orthonormal). Stated otherwise, (iii) says that H\u03bc (w; q, t) is normalized so\nthat Kn,\u03bc (q, t) = 1, for all \u03bc. Since the one-part partition (n) is largest in dominance\norder, the equations in (5) imply that\n\u0015Y\n\u0014\nn\nw\n(1 \u2212 q k ),\nHn (w; q, t) = Hn (w; q) = en\n(6)\n1 \u2212 q k=1\n\nusing plethystic substitution notation (see [1] and section 4). Observe that we may drop\nthe parameter t, since it plays no role here. This is a special case of a Hall-Littlewood\npolynomial (see [16]), so that Hn (w; q) has coefficients\nX\nK\u03bb,n (q) =\nq coch(\u03c4 ) ,\n(7)\n\u03bb(\u03c4 )=\u03bc\n\nwhere the sum is over the set of standard tableaux \u03c4 , of shape \u03bb(\u03c4 ) = \u03bc, with coch(\u03c4 )\nstanding for the cocharge statistic (see [16]) of \u03c4 . For example,\nH1 (w; q) = S1 (w),\nH2 (w; q) = S2 (w) + q S11 (w),\n\u0001\nH3 (w; q) = S3 (w) + q 2 + q S21 (w) + q 3 S111 (w),\n\u0001\n\u0001\nH4 (w; q) = S4 (w) + q 3 + q 2 + q S31 (w) + q 4 + q 2 S22 (w)\n\u0001\n+ q 5 + q 4 + q 3 S211 (w) + q 6 S1111 (w).\n\nIt has been shown in [11] that\n\nH\u03bc (w; t, q) = H\u03bc (w; q, t),\nwhere H\u03bc := L\u2202 [\u2206\u03bc ] stands for the Garsia-Haiman module, obtained as the linear\nspan of all partial derivatives of the determinant\n\u0001\n\u2206\u03bc := det xai yib 1\u2264i\u2264n ,\n(a,b)\u2208\u03bc\n\nwith (a, b) \u2208 \u03bc meaning that 0 \u2264 b \u2264 l(\u03bc) \u2212 1, and 0 \u2264 a \u2264 \u03bci \u2212 1 (pairs being ordered\nlexicographically).\nIn our discussion, we also make use of the Sn -submodules (see [3]):\n\\\nH\u03bc\u2193 :=\nH\u03bd ,\n\u03bd\u2192\u03bc\n\n\f4\n\nF. BERGERON\n\nwhere \u03bd \u2192 \u03bc means that the partition \u03bd precedes \u03bc in the Young lattice. Using a\nset of heuristics discussed in [3], we can calculate H\u03bc\u2193 (w; q, t) in terms of Macdonald\npolynomials.\nThe \u2207 operator. Since the H\u03bc (w; q, t) form a basis of \u039b, we can define a linear operator\n\u2207 (read \"nabla\") on degree n symmetric functions by imposing that\nY\n\u2207(H\u03bc (w; q, t)) = H\u03bc (w; q, t)\nq a tb .\n(a,b)\u2208\u03bc\n\nThus the H\u03bc (w; q, t) are eigenfunctions of \u2207 with simple, explicit eigenvalues expressed\nin term of the partition statistic\nX\nn(\u03bc) :=\n(i \u2212 1)\u03bci .\ni\n\n\u2032\n\nIndeed, the above definition is equivalent to \u2207(H\u03bc (w; q, t)) := q n(\u03bc ) tn(\u03bc) H\u03bc (w; q, t). Recall that the main result in this context is that\nDn (w; q, t) = \u2207(en (w)),\n\n(8)\n\nwhere Dn is being consider over two sets of n variables, as expressed by the use of the\ntwo parameters q and t (rather than q1 and q2 ).\nAs discussed in [5], explicit calculations reveal that the effect of \u2207 on Schur functions is\nstriking. To expresse this, let us consider the matrix \u2207(n) := (\u2207\u03bb\u03bc )\u03bb,\u03bc\u22a2n , with\n\u2207\u03bb\u03bc (q, t) := h\u2207(S\u03bb (w)), S\u03bc (w)i.\nHere, we order partitions in decreasing lexicographic order, i.e.: 3, 21, 111 for n = 3.\nThe coefficients of these matrices are symmetric polynomials in the variables q and t. We\nexpand them as Schur polynomials (denoted with a lowercase \"s\" to further distinguish\nthem from the S\u03bc (w)), omitting the variables q and t. For n = 2, we get\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 \u2212s11\n(2)\n\u2207 =\n,\n1 s1\nand for n = 3,\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0\ns22\ns32\n\u2212s31 \uf8f8 .\n\u2207(3) = \uf8ed0 \u2212s21\n1 s2 + s1 s3 + s11\nInspection of these matrices, together with some theoretical considerations, leads to\nConjecture 1 (see [5]). For all \u03bb and \u03bc,\n(\u22121)m(\u03bb) \u2207\u03bb\u03bc (q, t)\nhas positive integer coefficients when expanded in terms of Schur polynomials, with\n\u0012 \u0013\nX\nk\n+\n(i \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03bb\u2032i ),\nm(\u03bb) :=\n(9)\n2\n\u2032\n\u03bbi <(i\u22121)\n\nk being the number of parts of \u03bb.\n\n\fPRELIMINARY VERSION\n\n5\n\nSimilar conjectures have also been formulated in [5] for iterates of \u2207, and for more general\noperators (see Section 4). Conjecture 1 has been shown to hold in the special case t = 1\nby Lenart in [14]. Among other results along these lines, let us also mention the work of\nCan and Loehr in [7].\n3. Representation theoretic conjecture for \u2207(\u2212S2,1n\u22122 )\nGoing back to the spaces introduced in section 2, we have the following.\nProposition 1. The space Dn;n is isomorphic to the restriction to Sn of the Sn+1 -module\nDn+1 .\nProof. Let us denote by x\u2032 the set of n+ 1 variables x1 , . . . , xn , xn+1 , obtained by adding\none extra variable to x. We check that Dn;n = L\u2202,E [en (x)\u2206n (x)] is isomorphic to the\nrestriction to Sn of Dn+1 = L\u2202,E [\u2206n+1 (x\u2032 )] as follows. Considering its expansion as a\npolynomial in the variable xn+1 , it is easily seen that we may write \u2206n+1 (x\u2032 ) in the form\n\u2206n+1 (x\u2032 ) = en (x)\u2206n (x) + xn+1 g(x\u2032 ),\n\n(10)\n\nfor some polynomial g(x\u2032). Since (\u2202x1 + . . . + \u2202xn+1 )\u2206n+1 (x\u2032 ) = 0, it is also easy to check\nthat we may construct a basis of Dn+1 by application on \u2206n+1 (x\u2032 ) of some operators\nbuilt using only the E-operators and partial derivatives involving variables xk , for which\n1 \u2264 k \u2264 n. It follows that application of these same operators on the \"leading\" part\nen (x)\u2206n (x) of (10), we get a basis of Dn;n . Clearly this is all compatible with the action\nof Sn on the first n variables in x\u2032 .\n\u0003\nBy general principles (see [1]), we conclude that we have the Frobenius equality\nDn;n (w; q, t) = \u2202p1 Dn+1 (w; q, t).\n\n(11)\n\nUsing opeartors calculus outlined in section 4, it follows that\nProposition 2.

The case k = 1 of Conjecture 2 is\nthus seen to be equivalent to\nConjecture 3.\nOY (w; q, t) = \u2207(\u2212S21n\u22122 (w)).\nSimilar descriptions can be obtained for other values of k. A recent conjecture of N. Loehr\nand G. Warrington (see [15]) describes in a combinatorial manner, for all partition \u03bb, the\nexpansion of \u2207(S\u03bb (w)) in terms of monomial symmetric functions. However, this gives\nonly a purely enumerative description of the coefficients of the expansion of \u2207(S\u03bb (w))\nin terms of the LLT symmetric polynomials (see [13]).\n\n4. Operators\nWe have already used plethystic substitution to describe Hn (w; q) in (6). Recall that this\noperation turns symmetric functions into operators on the ring \u039b, in the following manner. We first expand every symmetric function in terms of power sum p\u03bb = p\u03bb1 * * * p\u03bbk ,\nand then apply the following rules:\n\u2022 pk [c] = c if c is a constant;\n\u2022 pk [x] = xk if x is a variable;\n\u2022 pk [pj ] = pk*j ;\n\u2022 F [f + g] = F [f ] + F [g], and (F + G)[f ] = F [f ] + G[f ];\n\u2022 F [f * g] = F [f ] * F [g], and (F * G)[f ] = F [f ] * G[f ].\nFor the purpose of such calculations, w is identified with w1 + w + 2 + . . . = p1 (w). As\nin [5], we can now introduce the operators Dm (on symmetric functions f (w)) defined\nby the generating function identity\n\u221e\nX\n\nm=\u2212\u221e\n\nDm (f (w)) \u03be m := f [w + \u03b1/\u03be] \u03a9\u2032 (w; \u2212\u03be),\n\n(16)\n\n\fPRELIMINARY VERSION\n\n7\n\nwith \u03b1 = \u03b1(q, t) := (1 \u2212 q)(1 \u2212 t), and\n\u2032\n\n\u03a9 (w; \u03be) :=\n\nX\n\nk\n\nek (w) \u03be =\n\nn\nY\n\n(1 + ri \u03be).\n\ni=1\n\nk\u22650\n\nNow, recall from [5] that we have\n\u22121\np\u22a5\n1 \u2207 = \u03b1 \u2207 D\u22121 .\n\n(17)\n\nFor a symmetric function f , the operator f \u22a5 is dual to multiplication by f , for the Hall\nscalar product. We apply both sides of this operator identity to en+1 (w), and calculate\n(directly using (16)) that\n\u2202p1 \u2207(en+1 (w)) = \u2207(\u03b1\u22121 D\u22121 (en+1 (w)))\n!\nn\nX\n[k + 1]q,t ek (w) en\u2212k (w)\n= \u2207\nk=0\n\n=\n\nn\nX\n\n[k + 1]q,t \u2207(ek (w) en\u2212k (w)).\n\nk=0\n\nUsing (8), we conclude that (12) holds, since\nDn;n (w; q, t) = \u2202p1 \u2207(en+1 (w))\nn\nX\n=\n[k + 1]q,t \u2207(ek (w) en\u2212k (w)).\nk=0\n\nThis proves Proposition 2.\n\nLet us recall some more operators identities of [5] and [8].

Implicitly, a partition is here identified with the set of\ncells of its Ferrers diagram. In formula, the above definition can be stated as\n\u2207f (H\u03bc (w; q, t)) := f [B\u03bc ] H\u03bc (w; q, t).\n\n(21)\n\nObserve that we clearly have the operator identities \u2207f +g = \u2207f + \u2207g and \u2207f g = \u2207f \u2207g .\nMoreover all these operators commute among themselves since they share a common\nbasis of eigenfunctions.

In particular, when restricted to the subspace of degree n homogeneous symmetric functions, the operator \u2207n is simply the usual \u2207. In other terms, the usual \u2207\nis\nX\n\u2207=\n\u2207k \u03c0k ,\nk\n\nwith \u03c0k denoting the projection of the ring\nPof symmetric functions on its homogeneous\ncomponent of degree k. For the case f = k=0 ek uk , we denote by \u03a8 the operator \u2206f .\nIn other words, we have\nY\n\u03a8(H\u03bc ) =\n(1 \u2212 q a tb u) H\u03bc.\n(25)\n(a,b)\u2208\u03bc\n\nWhen restricted to degree n symmetric functions, the operator \u03a8 clearly expands as\n\u03a8 = Id + u \u22071 + u2 \u22072 + . . . + un\u22121 \u2207n\u22121 + un \u2207n .\n\n(26)\n\n\fPRELIMINARY VERSION\n\n9\n\nFor the sake of clarity, we now denote by \u03c1 the operator p\u22a5\n1 . Let us also write \u03b8 for\nthe operator \u03b1\u22121 D\u22121 , so that formulas appearing in formulas (I.12) of [5] may now be\nrewritten as\n(a) D0 = Id \u2212 \u03b1 \u22071 ,\n(b) \u03b1 Dk+1 = Dk \u03b9 \u2212 \u03b9 Dk ,\n\u22121\n(c) D1 = \u2212\u2207 \u03b9 \u2207 ,\n(d) \u03b8 = \u2207\u22121 \u03c1 \u2207,\n(e) \u03a8\u22121 e1 \u03a8 = e1 + u \u03b8,\n\n(f) e1 \u2207k = \u2207k e1 + \u2207k\u22121 \u03b8.\n\nWe are now ready to derive more identities in the line of these.\nProposition 3. We have the linear operators identities:\n\u03a8\u22121 \u03c1 \u03a8 = \u03c1 + u \u03b8,\n\u03c1\u2207k = \u2207k \u03c1 + \u2207k\u22121 \u03b8.\n\n(27)\n(28)\n\nProof. The first identity is easy to \"check\" by direct application on the basis of Macdonald polynomials. Indeed, recalling the dual Pieri formula of Macdonald\nX\n\u03c1 H\u03bc =\nc\u03bc,\u03bd H\u03bd ,\n\u03bd\u2192\u03bc\n\nwith \u03bd \u2192 \u03bc indicating that \u03bd is covered by \u03bc in the Young lattice of partitions, and the\nc\u03bc,\u03bd = c\u03bc,\u03bd (q, t) being explicit rational fractions in q and t (see [8]). Applying the left\nhand side of (27) to H\u03bc we get\nX\n\u03a8\u22121 \u03c1 \u03a8(H\u03bc ) =\nc\u03bc,\u03bd (1 \u2212 q a\u03bd tb\u03bd u)H\u03bd ,\n\u03bd\u2192\u03bc\n\nwhere (a\u03bd , b\u03bd ) stands for the coordinates of the corner cell by which \u03bd differs from \u03bc.\nThe right hand side of this last equality can clearly be written in the form\n\u03a8\u22121 \u03c1 \u03a8(H\u03bc ) = \u03c1 H\u03bc + u \u2207\u22121\u03c1\u2207(H\u03bd ),\nand we conclude using the operator equality \u03b8 = \u2207\u22121 \u03c1\u2207 (see [5, Formulas I.12]). Comparing coefficients of uk in the expansion in (26), it follows from (27) that (28) holds. \u0003\nIterative applications of (28) gives that\nn\nX\n\u03c1n \u2207m =\n\nX\n\n\u2207m\u2212j \u03b1,\n\n(29)\n\nj=0 \u03b1\u2208Aj,n\u2212j\n\n\u0001\nj+k\n\nwith Aj,k denoting the set of k operators that can be obtained by composing j copies\nof \u03c1 and k copies of \u03b8 in all possible order. Applying both sides of (29) to en (w), we find\nthat\nn\u22121\nX\nn\n\u03b8k \u03c1 \u03b8n\u22121\u2212k en (w),\n\u03c1 \u2207n\u22121 (en (w)) =\n(30)\nk=0\n\nsince all other terms of the resulting sum vanish, and \u22070 = Id. It happens (as we will see\nbelow) that \u2207n\u22121 (en (w)) corresponds to the bigraded Frobenius characteristic of some\nSn -module. Formula (30) can be used to get an explicit formula for the Hilbert series of\nthis module.\n\n\f10\n\nF.
