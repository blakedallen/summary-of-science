We give a new construction of the Mathon perp-system of the five dimensional\nprojective space over the field with three elements, starting from four lines.\n\n1. Introduction\nThere are certain maximal arcs of PG(2, q 2 ), q even, constructed by Denniston [4] for which\nthere is a non-degenerate orthogonal polarity of PG(2, q 2 ) such that for every point of the\nmaximal arc, its polar line is an exterior line of the arc. Such maximal arcs are called self-polar\nand they give rise to interesting partial geometries with parameters pg(q 2 \u22121, (q 2 +1)(q\u22121), q\u22121)\n(see [2]). If we choose a basis for GF(q 2 ) over GF(q), we can identify the vectors of GF(q 2 )3\nwith the vectors of GF(q)6 . Thus a maximal arc of PG(2, q 2 ) corresponds to an SPG-regulus of\nlines of PG(5, q), however, the resulting polarity is degenerate1. The notion of a perp-system was\nintroduced by [3] as a particular type of self-polar SPG-regulus of a finite projective space, and\nmoreover, one that produces a partial geometry under linear representation. A perp-system P\nof a projective space PG(d, q), with respect to a polarity \u03c1, is a maximal set of mutually disjoint\nr-subspaces of PG(d, q) such that every two not necessarily distinct elements of P are opposite\n(with respect to \u03c1). So in particular, every element of a perp-system is non-singular with respect\nto \u03c1. By maximal we mean that the cardinality of P attains the theoretical upper bound of\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0011\nq (d\u22122r\u22121)/2 q (d+1)/2 + 1 / q (d\u22122r\u22121)/2 + 1\n(see [3, Theorem 2.1]). In [3], a particular perp-system M attributed to Mathon was given as\na set of 21 lines of PG(5, 3) with respect to a symplectic polarity. It turns out that M is also\na perp-system with respect to some elliptic and some hyperbolic polarity, and its full stabiliser\nin PGL(6, 3) is S5 ; a maximal subgroup of PGSp(6, 3). Mathon's perp-system is the only known\nperp-system not arising from a maximal arc of PG(2, q).\nIn trying to understand the only known perp-system not arising from a maximal arc, the\nauthors found that everything begins with finding as set F4 of four curious lines of the projective\nspace PG(5, 3). Every line of PG(5, 3) can be represented by a 2 \u00d7 6 matrix of rank 2, and so we\ncan write these four lines so that they look like a frame of a projective plane (i.e., the blow-up\nof a frame of PG(2, 9)):\n\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

The matrices I and O denote the\n2-dimensional identity and zero matrices respectively over GF(3).\n\nIn this note we give a geometric construction of Mathon's perp-system, starting from the\nset of lines F4 above. Via this construction, we also show that Mathon's perp-system is related\nto the generalised quadrangle W(2). We should also note that Mathon's perp-system provides\ninsight into the embedding of A5 as a maximal subgroup of PSp(6, 3). As far as the authors\nare aware, the only raison d'\u00eatre for this embedding comes from the character table of SL(2, 5).\nThe faithful absolutely irreducible ordinary character of SL(2, 5) of degree 6 has zero 3-defect\nand is rational, hence it is absolutely irreducible over GF(3). The Frobenius-Schur indicator of\nthis character is \u22121, hence both the ordinary representation and its representation over GF(3)\nadmit a symplectic form, which we can see from the Brauer character table below (in mod 3):\n\n\u03c61\n\u03c62\n\u03c63\n\u03c64\n\u03c65\n\u03c66\n\u03c67\n\nind\n+\n+\n+\n+\n-\n\n1a\n1\n3\n3\n4\n2\n2\n6\n\n2a\n1\n3\n3\n4\n\u22122\n\u22122\n\u22126\n\n4a\n1\n\u22121\n\u22121\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n5a\n1\nA\nA\u2217\n\u22121\n\u2212A\n\u2212A\u2217\n1\n\n10a\n1\nA\nA\u2217\n\u22121\nA\nA\u2217\n\u22121\n\n5b\n1\nA\u2217\nA\n\u22121\n\u2212A\u2217\n\u2212A\n1\n\n10b\n1\nA\u2217\nA\n\u22121\nA\u2217\nA\n\u22121\n\nTable 2.

A Construction of Mathon's Perp-System\nA partial geometry pg(s, t, \u03b1) is a partial linear space such that every line contains s + 1\npoints, every point is incident with t + 1 lines and for a point P and line l which are not\nincident, there are \u03b1 points on l collinear with P . We have already spoken fleetingly of partial\ngeometries in the introduction where we mentioned that maximal arcs and perp-systems give\nrise to partial geometries. In turn, a partial geometry gives rise to a strongly regular graph\nsrg((s + 1)(st + \u03b1)/\u03b1, s(t + 1), s \u2212 1 + t(\u03b1 \u2212 1), \u03b1(t + 1)),\nand up to duality, we only know of about eight constructions of partial geometries (see [2, 4.1]).\nFor \u03b1 = 2, the only known partial geometries are sporadic: the Van Lint-Schrijver, Haemers\nand Mathon partial geometries, the latter arising from Mathon's perp-system M.\nFrom [3], it is known that M consists of 21 lines of PG(5, 3) forming a partial line-spread.\nThe complement of M contains precisely 21 solids mutually intersecting in lines, and there\nare exactly three solids through any point in this complement. They showed by an exhaustive\ncomputer search, that up to projectivity, there was only one such configuration of solids. This\nwas enough for Cristina Tonesi [9] to ascertain that if a partial geometry with \u03b1 = 2 is a linear\nrepresentation of a perp-system, then it is equivalent to the partial geometry arising from the\nMathon perp-system. We will now develop a construction of Mathon's perp-system from the\nfour lines F4 . Let X be the following skew-symmetric matrix over GF(3):\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 1\n.\n2 0\n\n\fA GEOMETRIC CONSTRUCTION OF MATHON'S PERP-SYSTEM FROM FOUR LINES OF PG(5, 3)\n\n3\n\nLemma 2.1. Let W(M ) be a symplectic space W(5, 3) defined by a Gram matrix M . Then F4\nis a partial perp-system with respect to W(M ) if and only if M is of the form\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u00b1X\nA\nB\n\uf8ed\u2212AT \u00b1X\nC \uf8f8\nT\nT\n\u2212B\n\u2212C\n\u00b1X\nfor invertible matrices A, B, C satisfying:\n(i) the sum of the blocks of M is nonzero;\n(ii) A + B \u2212 X, B + C \u2212 X and C + A \u2212 X are invertible.\n\nProof. That l1 , l2 and l3 are self-opposite implies that the three diagonal blocks of M are\neach equal to \u00b1X. Now consider l4 . Note that (I I I) M (I I I)T is the sum of all the blocks of\nM , and we require this to be nonzero. So we know that M is of the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u00b1X\nA\nB\n\u2212AT \u00b1X C\n\u2212B T \u2212C T \u00b1X\n\nfor some matrices A, B, C. For l1 , l2 and l3 to be opposite to one another, we need that A, B,\nC are each invertible. Condition (ii) follows from requiring that l1 , l2 and l3 are opposite to\nl4 .\n\u0003\n2.1. From Four to Five. Let W(M ) be the symplectic space defined by the Gram matrix:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nO X X\n\uf8edX O X \uf8f8\nX X O\n\nand let \u22a5 denote the corresponding polarity. If K is a set of subspaces of a projective space, we\nwill use the notation K2 to denote the spans of all distinct pairs of elements of K.\nLemma 2.2. Let L be the set of lines of W(M ) which are disjoint from each element of F24 ,\nand which for each l \u2208 F4 meets l\u22a5 in a point. The set L has 24 lines, and they can each be\nrepresented by a matrix of the form\n\u0001\nI R S\nwhere R, S, R \u2212 I and S \u2212 I are invertible, and R + S, R + I, S + I have rank 1. Moreover,\nthe element-wise stabiliser H of F4 in GL(6, 3) is the set of all diagonal matrices of the form\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nE O O\n\uf8edO E O \uf8f8\nO O E\nwhere E \u2208 GL(2, 3). The quotient by the scalars yields a group isomorphic to S4 , and this group\nacts transitively (under the induced projective action), and hence regularly, on the set of 24\nelements of L.\n\nProof. Consider an element l of L and represent it as a 2 \u00d7 6 matrix over GF(3), split into\nthree 2 \u00d7 2 blocks:\nl : (Q R S)\n\u0001\nSimilarly,\nSince l is disjoint from the solid represented by OI OI O\nO , it follows that S is invertible.\n\u0001\nI\nO\nO\nQ and R are invertible. Since l is disjoint from the solid represented by I I I , it follows\u0001 that\nI O O\nS \u2212 R has rank 2. Similarly, R \u2212 Q and Q \u2212 S are invertible. Now l\u22a5\n1 has matrix O I \u2212I and\nso R + S has rank 1. Similarly,\n\u0001 the matrices Q + R and S + Q have rank 1. Now we look at\nI O \u2212I\n\u22a5\nl4 , which has matrix O I \u2212I , and we see that Q + R + S has rank 1. Now l must be totally\nisotropic, which is equivalent to\nRXQ + SXQ + QXR + SXR + QXS + RXS = 0.\nWithout loss of generality, we may suppose that Q is the identity matrix. Hence\n(i) R \u2212 I and S \u2212 I are invertible;\n(ii) R + S, R + I, S + I, and R + S + I have rank 1;\n\n\f4\n\nJOHN BAMBERG AND FRANK DE CLERCK\n\n(iii) RS + SX + XR + SXR + XS + RXS = 0.\nThere are eight matrices Y of GL(2, 3) such that Y \u2212 I is invertible and Y + I has rank 1, and\nthey are\n( 02 11 ) , ( 01 21 ) , ( 12 10 ) , ( 11 20 ) , ( 21 02 ) , ( 22 02 ) , ( 20 12 ) , ( 20 22 ) .\nFor each matrix Y above, there are exactly three of the eight matrices which when added to Y\nproduce a matrix of rank 1. So we have 24 pairs (R, S) which satisfy the first two conditions\nabove. Moreover, one can check that the third condition is satisfied.\nIt is not difficult to see that the eight matrices underlying the set L in fact form a conjugacy\nclass of GL(2, 3). Now suppose E \u2208 GL(2, 3) and consider an element (I R S) of L. The image\nof (I R S) under right multiplication by the element of H arising from E is (E, RE, SE). Now\nobserve that if we were to normalise this 2 \u00d7 6 matrix by elementary matrices so that we\ngenerate the same line, we would need to apply the elementary matrices to the left of this\nmatrix. So (E, RE, SE) represents the same line as (I, E \u22121 RE, E \u22121 SE). Therefore L is Hinvariant (under the induced projective action). Clearly this action is also transitive as the eight\nmatrices underlying the set L form a conjugacy class of GL(2, 3).\n\u0003\nConstruction 2.3. Let F5 be the set F4 augmented by one of the lines (I R S) of L.\nLemma 2.4. The setwise stabiliser of F5 in PGL(6, 3) is isomorphic to S5 , and this group\nstabilises the symplectic forms defined by the Gram matrices\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nO\nA\nB\n\uf8ed\u2212AT\nO\nC\uf8f8\nT\nT\n\u2212B\n\u2212C\nO\nwhere A + B + C and ART + BS T + RCS T are both symmetric matrices.\n\nProof. It is not difficult to show that the five lines determine the shape of the matrix above.\nThat is, any skew-symmetric matrix M for which lM lT = 0 for all of our five lines l, must be of\nthe form stated. For example, that (I I I) is totally isotropic with respect to the symplectic form\ndefined by a skew-symmetric matrix of the form above, implies that A + B + C is symmetric.\nSo now we just show that the stabiliser G of F5 is isomorphic to S5 . Recall from Lemma 2.2\nthat the element-wise stabiliser H of F4 in GL(6, 3) is the set of all matrices of the form\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nE O O\n\uf8edO E O \uf8f8\nO O E\nwhere E \u2208 GL(2, 3), and the quotient by the scalars yields a group isomorphic to S4 acting\nregularly on L. So the action of G on F5 is faithful and hence we know that G is embedded in\nS5 .

From Five to Six. Most of us are familiar with the isomorphism of S5 with PGL(2, 5)\nwhich gives rise to two 5-transitive actions of S5 : on five and six points respectively. To obtain\nthe action on six points directly from the action on five points, one simply notices that S5\nhas six subgroups of order 5 which are permuted naturally under the conjugation action of S5 ;\nthus producing the multiply transitive action on 6 elements. Likewise, the stabiliser S5 of F5\ndetermines a special set of six lines from L. The total number of lines of PG(6, 3) is 11011, which\nyou will notice is congruent to 1 modulo 5. Hence a 5-cycle has a unique fixed line. The six\nlines F6 we want are precisely those lines of PG(5, 3) which are fixed by some 5-cycle in S5 .\nConstruction 2.5. Let F6 be those lines of PG(5, 3) which are fixed by some 5-cycle in S5 .\nLemma 2.6. The lines F6 form a partial perp-system of W(M ) where M is a matrix of the\nform\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nO\nA\nB\n\uf8ed\u2212AT\nO\nC\uf8f8\nT\nT\n\u2212B\n\u2212C\nO\nwhere A + B + C and ART + BS T + RCS T are both symmetric matrices.\n\nProof. By Lemma 2.2, we may chose our favourite representative for (I R S), since any\nother choice will result in a set of lines projectively equivalent to our choice for F5 . So let\nR := ( 22 02 ) and S := ( 20 22 ). Recall from Lemma 2.4 that the stabiliser of F5 as a group of\nmatrices is SL(2, 5) : 2 and is generated by C and D from the proof of Lemma 2.4.

Then for every \u03b1 in\nF6 , there is a unique line l contained in \u03b1 with the following properties:\n\u03b1\n2\n(i) l\u03b1 is opposite to all elements of F6 ;\n(ii) l\u03b1 is disjoint from \u03b1\u2032 for all pairs \u03b1\u2032 \u2208 F26 different to \u03b1.\nProof. As in the proof of Lemma 2.4, we may use the transitivity of H in Lemma 2.2 to\nconcentrate on a particular choice of element (I R S) of L for out set F5 , and hence for our set\nF6 :\n( 1. 1. 11 2. 22 2. ) ( 1. 1. 11 2. 12 1. )\n\n( 1. 1. 1. 21 2. 11 )\n\n( 1. 1. 1. 12 22 2. ) ( 1. 1. 2. 22 21 1. ) ( 1. 1. 2. 22 2. 11 ).\nIt turns out, after some tedious calculation, that we get the following set of fifteen lines, one l\u03b1\nfor each \u03b1 \u2208 F26 :\n( 1. 1. 2. 22 2. 22 ) ( 1. 1. .. .. 2. 11 ) ( 1. 1. 1. 1. 2. 22 )\n\n( .. .. 1. 1. 11 2. )\n\n( 1. 1. 1. 12 1. 1. )\n\n( .. .. 1. 1. 21 1. )\n\n( 1. 1. 22 2. .. .. )\n\n( 1. 1. 11 2. .. .. )\n\n( 1. 1. 1. 1. .. .. )\n\n( 1. 1. 22 2. 22 2. )\n\n( 1. 1. .. .. 1. 1. )\n\n( .. .. 1. 1. 1. 1. )\n\n( 1. 1. .. .. 2. 22 )\n\n( 1. 1. 22 2. 1. 1. ) ( 1. 1. 1. 1. 21 1. ).\n\nThe Gram matrix M is, in this case,\n\uf8eb.\n\n.\n\uf8ed1\n1\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n2\n2\n\n2\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n2\n.\n.\n.\n2\n.\n\n.\n1\n.\n1\n.\n.\n\n.\n1\n. \uf8f8.\n.\n.\n.\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u0003\n\nTherefore, we arrive at the construction of Mathon's perp-system starting from our original\nset of four lines F4 .\nConstruction 2.8 (Mathon's perp-system). Let M be F6 together with the set of all fifteen\nlines l\u03b1 defined in Lemma 2.7.\n2.4. Conversely... We revised before that to derive the action of S5 on six points given\nits action on five points, we simply consider the action of S5 on its 5-cycles. To invert this\nprocedure, we take blocks of imprimitivity consisting of triples on the 15 pairs of elements from\n{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, and act naturally on these five sets of triples. (In fact, these triples are known as\nsynthemes, which we will see in the following section). So we take triples of pairs of lines from\nF6 , and we get the set F5 back again by taking for each triple T , the intersection of the spans\nof the pairs in T .\n3. The generalised quadrangle W(2)\nThe smallest thick generalised quadrangle is W(2) and it has 15 points and 15 lines. The most\ncommon construction of this generalised quadrangle is to take a symplectic form on V := GF(2)4 ,\nfor example hx, yi = x1 y4 + x4 y1 + x2 y3 + x3 y2 , and then consider the two-dimensional subspaces\nof V for which this form vanishes. These two-spaces together with all of the nonzero vectors of V\nform the unique generalised quadrangle of order 2 (up to isomorphism). The oldest construction\nof W(2) is due to Sylvester (see [7, Section 6]). Consider the six element set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. A\nduad is an unordered pair of distinct elements from this set and a syntheme is a set of three\nduads which are mutually disjoint. One obtains a generalised quadrangle of order 2 by letting\nthe duads be the points, synthemes as the lines and natural inclusion for incidence. It can be\neasily shown that Sylvester's duad-syntheme geometry is a generalised quadrangle of order 2.\n\n\fA GEOMETRIC CONSTRUCTION OF MATHON'S PERP-SYSTEM FROM FOUR LINES OF PG(5, 3)\n\n7\n\nWe will use Mathon's perp-system to construct W(2). Let F26 be the set of 15 solids\nspanned by two elements of F6 , and let \u22a5 denote the symplectic polarity for which our 21 lines\nare a perp-system.\nConstruction 3.1 (Generalised Quadrangle of Order 2).\nLet F15 be the fifteen lines induced by F6 (see Lemma 2.7), and let F10 be the set of all lines of\nthe form hl, mi\u22a5 where l, m are different elements of F5 . Define the following incidence structure\nof points and lines:\nPoints:\nLines (i):\nLines (ii):\nIncidence\n\nthe elements of F15\nthe elements of F5\nthe elements of F10\nLet P be a point. A line l of type (i) is incident with P if and only if\nP \u2229 l\u22a5 = \u2205. A line l of type (ii) is incident with P if and only if P \u2286 l\u22a5 .\n\nTheorem 3.2. The incidence structure defined above is isomorphic to the generalised quadrangle\nW(2).\nProof. We can verify this result by computer, but we outline below a sketch of a proof\nwhich does not rely on the computer. To do this, we show that the geometry of Construction 3.1\nis isomorphic to Sylvester's syntheme-duad geometry. Recall that each line of F15 is uniquely\ndetermined by a pair of elements of F6 . If we label the elements of F6 as {m1 , m2 , . . . , m6 },\nthen let f be the bijection\nmij 7\u2192 {i, j}\nfrom F15 onto the set of duads, where mij is the unique element of F15 contained in hmi , mj i. We\nalso define now a bijection on the lines of the geometries. Recall that we can recover the action\nof S5 on five elements by taking a block-system of triples on the duads, and acting naturally\non these five sets of triples. In other words, we can find five synthemes which are mutually\ndisjoint. Such a set of synthemes is called a spread which is the geometric term for a partition\nof the points into lines. Now the permutation group induced by the stabiliser of F6 admits a\nblock system of five synthemes on the indices of {m1 , m2 , m3 , m4 , m5 , m6 }, and hence we have\na certain set S of five synthemes. Label the five elements of S by s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 , s5 . Now for each\npair of synthemes sa , sb from S, it is not difficult to see that there is a unique syntheme sab\nnot in S which is disjoint from sa and sb . So now we have a way to identify the two types of\nline sets of Construction 3.1. Label the elements of F5 by l1 , l2 , l3 , l4 , l5 . Define a map g from\nsynthemes to the lines of Construction 3.1 by assigning g(sa ) to la and by also assigning g(sab )\nto lab where lab = hla , lb i\u22a5 .\nThe next observation to make is that\n\\\nhmu , mv i\nla =\n{u,v}\u2282sa\n\nfor all a \u2208 {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. We now proceed to show that incidence is preserved through the maps\nf and g. Here is an outline of the two cases we need to consider:\n\nPoints\nLines (i)\nLines (ii)\nIncidence\nIncidence\n\nGeometry of Construction 3.1 Sylvester's Geometry\nF15 , mij\nDuads {i, j}\nF5 , la\nSpread of synthemes, sa\nF10 , lab\nOther synthemes, sab\n\u22a5\n=\n\u2205\n(I) mij \u2229 la\n{i, j} \u2286 sa\n(II) mij \u2286 hla , lb i\n{i, j} \u2286 sab\n\n\f8\n\nJOHN BAMBERG AND FRANK DE CLERCK\n\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\nIn the first case, note that for a \u2208 {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, we have l\u22a5\na = mu \u2229 mv : {u, v} \u2282 sa .\nHence we see that the first row of incidence relations correspond as\nE\nD\n\u22a5\n= \u2205 if and only if {i, j} \u2282 sa .\nmij \u2229 m\u22a5\n\u2229\nm\n:\n{u,\nv}\n\u2282\ns\na\nu\nv\n\nSimilarly, the second row of incidence relations follow once one has observed that\nmij \u2286 hla , lb i if and only if\n\n{i, j} \u2282 sab .\n\nWe leave the remaining details of this proof to the reader.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 3.3.\n(i) Using the Sylvester's model of W(2), one can also construct (see [7, Section 6]) the\nunique generalised quadrangle on 27 points and 45 lines.\n(ii) An affine embedding of W(2) into AG(3, 3) is known [8]. We have not been able to\nestablish a connection between this construction and ours, although they have the\nunderlying field in common.\n4.
