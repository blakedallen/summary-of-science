Note\nthat by combining Sobolev embedding, \u1e22 1 (Rn ) \u2286 L2n/(n\u22122) (Rn ), and (1.2) we see\nthat f (u(s)) will be a tempered distribution uniformly in s. Consequently, there is\nno difficulty interpreting (1.8) in the sense of tempered distributions at least.\n\nThe most important examples of nonlinearities of the above type are the defocusing\n4\npower nonlinearity f (u) := +|u| n\u22122 u and the focusing power nonlinearity f (u) :=\n4\n\u2212|u| n\u22122 u. Note that in these cases, the problem (1.1) is invariant under the scaling\n\u0010x\u0011\n\u0010 t x\u0011\n1\n1\nu(t, x) 7\u2192 (n\u22122)/2 u 2 ,\n, u0 (x) 7\u2192 (n\u22122)/2 u0\n\u03bb \u03bb\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n1\nn\nand that this scaling also preserves the \u1e22 (R ) norm of u0 . Thus we shall view\n(1.1) as an \u1e22x1 -critical or energy-critical equation3.\nThe Cauchy problem (1.1) has been studied extensively in the literature, especially\nin dimensions n = 3, 4; see the references below and particularly the books [2],\n[5], [6]. One can divide the theory into two parts: the \"local\" theory in which the\nsolution is either restricted to have small energy, or to have a certain spacetime\nnorm small (which can be achieved for instance by localizing the time interval)\nand the \"global\" theory in which there is no size restriction on the solution (other\nthan finite energy). Our focus here will be on the local theory, in which the exact\nchoice of the nonlinearity f does not play a major role; in particular, there will\nbe no distinction between the focusing and defocusing cases. However, the results\nhere will be applied towards the global theory. Specifically, they will be used\n(together with several other tools, notably an interaction Morawetz inequality and\nBourgain's induction on energy argument) in a future paper of the second author,\n2In dimensions n > 4, the nonlinearity is unlikely to be smooth and so we cannot use the usual\ntrick of working entirely with classical (Schwartz class) solutions first and then taking limits,\nunless one also performs some regularization of the nonlinearity. If however the nonlinearity is\nsmooth, then it is easy to see that Schwartz initial data leads to Schwartz solutions and, by using\nthe well-posedness and stability theory which we will develop, one can then express the strong\nsolutions given here as the unique strong limit of classical solutions.\n3In this paper we shall use energy synonymously with (the square of) the \u1e22 1 norm; the\nx\n2n/(n\u22122)\npotential energy (which is essentially the Lx\nnorm) will not play a role in our discussions.\n\n\fSTABILITY OF ENERGY-CRITICAL NLS\n\n3\n\n[21], establishing global well-posedness and scattering for the defocusing energycritical equation for large \u1e22 1 (Rn ) data for dimensions n > 4; the cases n = 3, 4\nwere treated in [7], [19] respectively (see also the works [1], [2], [13], [20] treating\nthe radial case).\nFor the energy-critical local theory it is convenient to introduce a number of scaleinvariant function spaces. We use Lrx (Rn ) to denote the Banach space of functions\nf : Rn \u2192 C whose norm\n\u0010Z\n\u00111/r\nkf kr :=\n|f (x)|r dx\nRn\n\nis finite (with the usual modification when r = \u221e). Similarly, for any spacetime slab\nI \u00d7 Rn , we use Lqt Lrx (I \u00d7 Rn ) to denote the Banach space of functions u : Rn \u2192 C\nwhose norm\n\u0010Z\n\u00111/q\nq\nkukLt Lrx (I\u00d7Rn ) = kukq,r :=\nku(t)kqr dt\nI\n\nis finite (with the usual modification when q = \u221e). We will omit mention of\nthe slab I \u00d7 Rn when it is clear from context. In addition to the energy space\nCt0 \u1e22x1 (I \u00d7 Rn ), we will also need the Strichartz space \u1e86 = \u1e86 (I \u00d7 Rn ), defined on\nI \u00d7 Rn as the closure of the test functions under the norm\nkuk\u1e86 := k\u2207uk 2(n+2) , 2n(n+2)\nn\u22122\n\nn2 +4\n\n(1.9)\n\nwhich is a convenient norm that is particularly well adapted for controlling solutions\nto (1.1). Similarly, we introduce the nonlinearity space \u1e44 1 (I \u00d7 Rn ) defined on\nI \u00d7 Rn as the closure of the test functions under the norm\n2n .\nkF k\u1e44 1 := k\u2207F k2, n+2\n\n(1.10)\n\nThis space is useful for controlling the forcing term f (u).\nA large part of the local theory for these energy-critical equations was worked\nout by Cazenave and Weissler, [3], [4], building upon earlier work of Ginibre-Velo,\n[11], and Kato, [14], for the energy-subcritical case. In this work, global solutions\nwere constructed for small energy data and local solutions were constructed for\nlarge energy data, though, as is to be expected for a critical equation, the time of\nexistence depends on the profile of the initial data and not simply on the energy.\nFurthermore, these solutions u were unique in a certain Strichartz space and in this\nspace the solution depended continuously4 on the initial data in the energy space\n\u1e22 1 (Rn ). A later argument of Cazenave, [6], also demonstrates that the uniqueness\nis in fact unconditional in the category of strong solutions (see also [15], [9], [10], [7]\nfor some related arguments; we reproduce the argument in Proposition 2.3 below).\nWe now give an extremely oversimplified sketch of how these results are obtained.\nWe rely heavily on the spaces \u1e86 (I \u00d7 Rn ) and \u1e44 1 (I \u00d7 Rn ) introduced earlier. The\n4Strictly speaking, the continuity in C 0 H 1 was only demonstrated for the defocusing equation;\nt x\nfor the general equation the continuity was established in Lqt Hx1 for any finite q. See [6] for further\ndiscussion. In this paper we shall obtain the stronger result of H\u00f6lder continuity for the general\nequation in the scale-invariant space Ct0 \u1e22x1 .\n\n\f4\n\nTERENCE TAO AND MONICA VISAN\n\nfundamental tools are the Strichartz estimate5\nZ t\ni(t\u2212t0 )\u2206\nei(t\u2212s)\u2206 F (s) ds \u1e86 . ku0 k\u1e22 1 (Rn ) + kF k\u1e44 1 ,\ne\nu0 +\n\n(1.11)\n\nt0\n\nwhenever the right-hand side is finite (and on any spacetime slab I \u00d7 Rn containing\nt = t0 ), as well as the Sobolev embedding\nkuk 2(n+2) , 2(n+2) . kuk\u1e86\nn\u22122\n\n(1.12)\n\nn\u22122\n\nfor all u \u2208 \u1e86 (I \u00d7 Rn ). We also take advantage of the H\u00f6lder inequality\n4/(n\u22122)\n\n2n \u2264 kvk 2(n+2)\nkv 4/(n\u22122) \u2207uk2, n+2\nn\u22122\n\n, 2(n+2)\nn\u22122\n\nkuk\u1e86 ,\n\n(1.13)\n\nwhich in conjunction with (1.5) and (1.12) implies that\n(n+2)/(n\u22122)\n\n4/(n\u22122)\n\nkf (u)k\u1e44 1 . kuk 2(n+2)\nn\u22122\n\n, 2(n+2)\nn\u22122\n\nkuk\u1e86 . kuk\u1e86\n\n.\n\n(1.14)\n\nCombining this with (1.11) we see that strong solutions to (1.8) which lie in\n\u1e86 (I \u00d7 Rn ) obey the a priori estimate\n(n+2)/(n\u22122)\n\nkuk\u1e86 . ku0 k\u1e22 1 + kuk\u1e86\nx\n\n,\n\nwhich then suggests that u stays small in \u1e86 (I \u00d7 Rn ) whenever u0 is small in\n\u1e22 1 (Rn ). This can be made more rigorous by setting up an iteration scheme to\nconstruct u; the case of large energy can be dealt with by an appropriate truncation of time (to reduce the \u1e86 (I \u00d7 Rn ) norm of ei(t\u2212t0 )\u2206 u0 ). The continuous\ndependence on the data is not difficult in rough spaces (e.g. in Ct0 L2x (I \u00d7 Rn )),\nbut to obtain continuous dependence in an energy-critical space was previously\nonly obtained in the defocusing case by a delicate argument, requiring the energy\nconservation law and a sharp form of Fatou's lemma; see [6] for details.\nThe above results (which were obtained by iteration in Strichartz spaces) already\nform a quite satisfactory local well-posedness theory in the energy space for the\nabove equations. However, there are still some points that need to be resolved.\nFirstly, the known arguments that establish continuous dependence on the data do\nnot necessarily establish uniformly continuous dependence on the data in energycritical spaces (though they do apply in more supercritical spaces, such as spaces\nthat scale like L2x (Rn )). In fact, in the low dimensional cases, n \u2264 6, it is possible\nto establish Lipschitz dependence on the data, because then we can differentiate\nequation (1.8) using (1.5) to obtain\nZ t\nei(t\u2212s)\u2206 [fz (u(s))\u2207u(s) + fz\u0304 (u(s))\u2207u(s)] ds (1.15)\n\u2207u(t) = ei(t\u2212t0 )\u2206 \u2207u0 \u2212 i\nt0\n\nand rely on the Lipschitz bounds (1.4) to control the difference between two solutions with slightly different data. The n = 3, 4 instances of this argument can be\nfound in [7], [19], as well as Section 3 below. However, in the high-dimensional case\nthe derivative maps fz , fz\u0304 are merely H\u00f6lder continuous instead of Lipschitz. If\n5Here and in the sequel, X . Y will denote an estimate of the form X \u2264 CY where C > 0\ndepends only on the dimension n.\n\n\fSTABILITY OF ENERGY-CRITICAL NLS\n\n5\n\none then tries to analyze differences of two solutions to (1.15) with slightly different\ninitial data, one no longer obtains any useful bounds6.\nClosely related to the continuous dependence of the data is the stability theory\nfor the equation (1.1). By this we mean the following type of property: given an\napproximate solution\n(\ni\u0169t + \u2206\u0169 = f (\u0169) + e\n(1.16)\n\u0169(t0 , x)\n= \u01690 (x) \u2208 \u1e22 1 (Rn )\nto (1.1), with e small in a suitable space and \u01690 \u2212 u0 small in \u1e22x1 , is it possible to\nshow that the genuine solution u to (1.1) stays very close to \u0169 (for instance, in the\n\u1e86 (I \u00d7 Rn )-norm)? Note that the question of continuous dependence of the data\ncorresponds to the case e = 0. Again, if n \u2264 6, an analysis based on subtracting\n(1.15) from the analogous equation for \u0169 and applying Strichartz estimates will\nyield a satisfactory theory, at least when \u0169 has small \u1e86 (I \u00d7 Rn )-norm; the case of\nlarge \u1e86 -norm can be obtained by partitioning the time interval and iterating the\nsmall norm theory. See [7], [19] for instances of this argument (which also appears\nimplicitly in [1], [2]). This type of approach does not work directly in dimensions\nn > 6 as the iteration is only H\u00f6lder continuous instead of Lipschitz and so, one\nis unable to close the argument effectively, even when one localizes time to make\nvarious norms small.\nThe purpose of this paper is to complete the previous analysis of Cazenave and\nWeissler for the Cauchy problem (1.1), by establishing a local well-posedness and\nstability theory which is H\u00f6lder continuous in energy-critical spaces and that applies\neven for large energy data, provided that the \u1e86 (I \u00d7 Rn )-norm is known to be\nbounded. This type of result is necessary for induction on energy type arguments,\nand will be applied in a subsequent paper of the second author, [21]. The main new\ntools will be an exotic Strichartz estimate, together with an estimate of fractional\nchain rule type; the point of working in an exotic Strichartz space is that it becomes\npossible to work with a small fractional derivative rather than a full derivative while\nstill remaining energy-critical with respect to scaling. A very similar technique was\nemployed by Nakanishi [18] for the energy-critical non-linear Klein-Gordon equation\nin high dimensions.\nWe now present our main results. We begin with a preliminary (and standard) local\nwell-posedness theorem, which gives existence and uniqueness, as well as Lipschitz\ncontinuity, but in rough (supercritical) topologies. It does not require any exotic\nStrichartz spaces or nonlinear estimates, relying instead on iteration in the usual\nStrichartz spaces, the Leibnitz rule (1.5), and H\u00f6lder's inequality. It is convenient\nto place the initial data in the inhomogeneous Sobolev space H 1 (Rn ) rather than\nthe homogeneous one \u1e22 1 (Rn ); once we obtain the H\u00f6lder continuity estimates on\nthe solution map, we will see that we can easily pass to the homogeneous space\nfrom the inhomogeneous one by a limiting argument.\n6This is basically because any estimate of the form A \u2264 \u03b5 + \u03b4A\u03b8 , where 0 < \u03b8 < 1, does not\nimply a bound on A which goes to zero as \u03b5 goes to zero, in contrast to the Lipschitz case, \u03b8 = 1,\nin which one can obtain a bound of the form A \u2264 2\u03b5 (say) if a continuity argument is available\nand \u03b4 \u2264 21 .\n\n\f6\n\nTERENCE TAO AND MONICA VISAN\n\nTheorem 1.1 (Standard local well-posedness, [3], [4]). Let I be a compact time\ninterval that contains t0 . Let u0 \u2208 H 1 (Rn ) be such that\nkei(t\u2212t0 )\u2206 u0 k\u1e86 (I\u00d7Rn ) \u2264 \u03b7\n\n(1.17)\n\nfor some 0 < \u03b7 \u2264 \u03b70 where \u03b70 > 0 is a small constant. Then there exists a unique\nsolution u to (1.1) in \u1e60 1 (I \u00d7 Rn ) (this space will be defined in the next section).\nMoreover, we have the bounds\nkuk\u1e86 (I\u00d7Rn ) . \u03b7\n\n(1.18)\n\nkuk\u1e60 1 (I\u00d7Rn ) . ku0 k\u1e22 1 (Rn ) + \u03b7\n\nn+2\nn\u22122\n\nkuk\u1e60 0 (I\u00d7Rn ) . ku0 kL2 (Rn ) .\n1\n\n(1.19)\n(1.20)\n\nn\n\nWe can generalize (1.20) as follows: if \u01690 \u2208 H (R ) is another initial data obeying\nthe hypothesis (1.17), with associated solution \u0169 \u2208 \u1e60 1 (I \u00d7 Rn ), then we have the\nLipschitz bound\nk\u0169 \u2212 uk\u1e60 0 (I\u00d7Rn ) . k\u01690 \u2212 u0 kL2 (Rn ) .\n(1.21)\nFor the convenience of the reader we give a proof of this standard result in Section 2;\nit does not require the H\u00f6lder continuity hypothesis (1.4). Remarkably, there is no\nrestriction on the H 1 (Rn )-norm of the initial data, though we do require that this\nnorm is finite. Instead, we have the smallness condition (1.17). Note from the\nStrichartz estimate (1.11) that\nkei(t\u2212t0 )\u2206 u0 k\u1e86 (I\u00d7Rn ) . ku0 k\u1e22 1 (Rn ) < \u221e.\nThis already gives local existence for all large energy data since, from the above\nStrichartz estimate and monotone convergence, we can establish the hypothesis\n(1.17) for intervals I that are sufficiently small (but note that the size of I will\ndepend on the profile of the initial data u0 and not just on its \u1e22 1 (Rn )-norm).\nAnother immediate corollary of the above theorem and the Strichartz estimate is\nCorollary 1.2 (Global well-posedness for small Hx1 data, [3], [4]). Let u0 \u2208 Hx1 be\nsuch that\nku0 k\u1e22 1 (Rn ) \u2264 \u03b70\n\n(1.22)\n\nfor some small absolute constant \u03b70 > 0 depending only on the dimension n. Then,\nthere exists a unique global \u1e60 1 (R \u00d7 Rn ) solution u to (1.1).

Let I be a compact time interval and\nlet \u0169 be an approximate solution to (1.1) on I \u00d7 Rn in the sense that\n(i\u2202t + \u2206)\u0169 = f (\u0169) + e\nfor some function e.

This theorem allows the energy of \u0169 and u\nto be large as long as the error e is small in a suitable norm, the free evolution\nof u \u2212 \u0169 is small in another norm, and \u0169 itself is small in a third norm. The\nn = 3, 4 cases of this theorem are in [7], [19] respectively, and the argument there\nextends easily to dimensions n = 5, 6. However, the cases n > 6 require a more\ndelicate argument. It is probably possible to replace the Besov-norm type expression\non the left-hand side of (1.26) by the Sobolev-norm expression kei(t\u2212t0 )\u2206 (u(t0 ) \u2212\n\u0169(t0 ))k\u1e86 (I\u00d7Rn ) , but this would presumably require the Coifman-Meyer theory of\nparaproducts and we will not pursue it here to simplify the exposition. The H\u00f6lder\n4\n7\nexponent (n\u22122)\n2 can be improved somewhat (perhaps to n\u22122 ) but we will not\nseek the optimal exponent here (for applications, all that is important is that this\nexponent is positive). However, it seems doubtful that one can obtain Lipschitz\ntype bounds when the dimension n is sufficiently large. Indeed, if one had Lipschitz\ncontinuous dependence on the initial data then, by taking variations of (1.1) in u,\none must (formally at least) have that the linearized equation\n(\nivt + \u2206v = fz (u(s))v(s) + fz\u0304 (u(s))v(s)\nv(t0 , x)\n= v0 (x) \u2208 \u1e22 1 (Rn ),\nwhich is a system of linear Schr\u00f6dinger equations in v and v with time-dependent,\nnon-self-adjoint potential, keeps the Hx1 norm of v(t) bounded in time. If n is large\nenough, it is unlikely that fz (u) (which behaves like |u|4/(n\u22122) ) remains in Hx1 or\n1/2\neven in Hx ; thus, it seems that solutions to this equation may leave Hx1 even\nwhen local smoothing effects (which typically gain half a derivative of regularity at\nmost) are exploited7. It seems however to be somewhat difficult to convert these\n7However, it is still possible to iterate the above linearized equation in lower regularity spaces\nof the same scaling as \u1e22x1 and, in particular, using the X and Y spaces introduced in Section 3,\n\n\f8\n\nTERENCE TAO AND MONICA VISAN\n\nheuristic arguments into an explicit and rigorous demonstration of non-Lipschitz\ncontinuity and we will not pursue this issue here.\nBy an easy iteration argument (as in [7], [19]) based on partitioning the time interval, we can relax hypothesis (1.25) by allowing \u0169 to be large (but still bounded in\nsome norm):\nTheorem 1.4 (Long-time perturbations).

As a corollary of this theorem we also obtain\na satisfactory scattering theory for these equations provided that one assumes a\n2(n+2)/(n\u22122)\nglobal Lt,x\nbound on solutions; see Corollary 4.1. This global bound is\nnot difficult to obtain for small energy data (it follows directly from Theorem 1.1),\nbut for large energy data the situation is substantially more delicate and requires\nfurther structural information on the nonlinearity. In [21] the second author will\nestablish this bound for the defocusing equation; in the focusing case, Glassey's\nvirial identity can be used to establish blowup for certain large data (even if the\ndata is smooth, spherically symmetric, and compactly supported); see [12].\nrecover estimates of Lipschitz type.

To prove Lemma 1.7, let us first make the following reductions. We note\nthat it suffices to take M = 1, since the claim for general M follows from Duhamel's\nformula and the triangle inequality. We can also take k to be 0, since the estimate\nfor k = 1 follows by applying \u2207 to both sides of the equation and noting that \u2207\ncommutes with i\u2202t + \u2206. As the Littlewood-Paley operators also commute with\ni\u2202t + \u2206, we have\n(i\u2202t + \u2206)PN u = PN F1\nfor all dyadic N . Applying the standard Strichartz estimates (see [16]), we get\nkPN ukq,r . kPN u(t0 )kL2x + kPN F1 kq1\u2032 ,r1\u2032\n\n(1.48)\n\nfor all admissible exponents (q, r) and (q1 , r1 ). Squaring (1.48), summing in N ,\nusing the definition of the \u1e60 0 -norm and the Littlewood-Paley inequality together\nwith the dual of (1.44), we get the claim.\n\u0003\n\n\f12\n\nTERENCE TAO AND MONICA VISAN\n\n2. Local well-posedness\nThe goal of this section is to establish the preliminary local well-posedness theorem,\ni.e., Theorem 1.1. The material here is standard but we include it for completeness.\nMore precise control on the continuous dependence on the data will be given in\nlater sections. Throughout this section the hypotheses are as in Theorem 1.1. All\nspacetime norms will be over I \u00d7 Rn unless otherwise specified.\n2.1. Existence. We consider first the question of local existence of \u1e60 1 solutions to\n(1.1) which we address via an iterative procedure. We define the following iterates\nu(0) (t) := 0,\nu(1) (t) := ei(t\u2212t0 )\u2206 u0 ,\nand for m \u2265 1,\nu(m+1) (t) := ei(t\u2212t0 )\u2206 u0 \u2212 i\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nei(t\u2212s)\u2206 f (u(m) (s))ds.\n\n(2.1)\n\nt0\n\nLet us first remark that the free evolution being small implies that all the iterates\nare small. Indeed, by (1.46) and the triangle inequality, followed by (1.14) and\n(1.17), we have\nku(m+1) k\u1e86 . kei(t\u2212t0 )\u2206 u0 k\u1e86 + kf (u(m) )k\u1e44 1\nn+2\n\nn\u22122\n.\n. \u03b7 + ku(m) k\u1e86\n\nUsing (1.17) as the base case of an induction hypothesis and choosing \u03b70 sufficiently\nsmall, we deduce\nku(m) k\u1e86 . \u03b7,\n\nn+2\n\nkf (u(m) )k\u1e44 1 . \u03b7 n\u22122\n\n(2.2)\n\nfor all m \u2265 1. Applying (1.45), we conclude that\nn+2\n\nku(m) k\u1e60 1 . ku0 k\u1e22 1 (Rn ) + \u03b7 n\u22122\n\n(2.3)\n\nfor all m \u2265 1.\nNext, we consider differences of the form u(m+1) \u2212 u(m) . By the recurrence relation\n(2.1), in order to estimate u(m+1) \u2212 u(m) we need to control f (u(m) ) \u2212 f (u(m\u22121) ).\nBy (2.2), (1.7) (with u = u(m) and v = u(m\u22121) ), and (1.47), we estimate\nku(m+1) \u2212 u(m) k\u1e60 0 . kf (u(m) ) \u2212 f (u(m\u22121) )k 2(n+2) , 2(n+2)\nn+4\nn+4\nX\n(m)\n(m\u22121)\n. ku\n\u2212u\nk 2(n+2) , 2(n+2)\nn\n\n. ku(m) \u2212 u(m\u22121) k\u1e60 0\n\nn\n\nm\u2032 =m,m\u22121\n\nX\n\n\u2032\n\n. \u03b7 n\u22122 ku(m) \u2212 u(m\u22121) k\u1e60 0 ,\n\nfor all m \u2265 1.

Choosing \u03b7 sufficiently small, we conclude that the sequence\n{u(m) }m is Cauchy in \u1e60 0 (I \u00d7 Rn ) and hence, there exists u \u2208 \u1e60 0 (I \u00d7 Rn ) such that\n2(n+2)/n\nu(m) converges to u in \u1e60 0 (I \u00d7 Rn ) (and thus also in Lt,x\n(I \u00d7 Rn )) as m \u2192 \u221e\nand furthermore, we have (1.20). The above argument also shows that f (u(m) )\n2(n+2)/(n+4)\nconverges to f (u) in Lt,x\n(I \u00d7 Rn ). Applying (1.47) again we conclude\nthat u solves (1.8). As the u(m) converge strongly to u in \u1e60 0 (I \u00d7 Rn ) and remain\nbounded in \u1e86 (I \u00d7 Rn ) and \u1e60 1 (I \u00d7 Rn ) thanks to (2.2) and (2.3), we see that the\nu(m) converge weakly to u in \u1e86 (I \u00d7 Rn ) and \u1e60 1 (I \u00d7 Rn ) and we obtain the bounds\n(1.18), (1.19). As u lies in both \u1e60 1 (I \u00d7 Rn ) and \u1e60 0 (I \u00d7 Rn ), it is in Ct0 Hx1 (I \u00d7 Rn )\nand is thus a strong solution to (1.1).\n2.2. Uniqueness. To prove uniqueness, we will in fact prove the following stronger\n(and standard) result:\nProposition 2.3 (Unconditional uniqueness in H 1 (Rn ), [6]). Let I be a time interval containing t0 , and let u1 , u2 \u2208 Ct0 Hx1 (I \u00d7 Rn ) be two strong solutions to (1.1)\nin the sense of (1.8). Then u1 = u2 almost everywhere.\nProof. By a standard continuity argument we may shrink I so that one can construct the solution given by the preceding iteration argument. Without loss of\ngenerality, we may to take u2 to be this solution; thus, u2 \u2208 \u1e60 1 (I \u00d7 Rn ).\nWrite v := u1 \u2212 u2 \u2208 Ct0 Hx1 (I \u00d7 Rn ), and let \u03a9 \u2282 I be the set of times t for which\nv(t) = 0 almost everywhere. Then \u03a9 is closed and contains t0 , so it suffices to show\nthat \u03a9 is open in I. Let t1 \u2208 \u03a9 and suppose also that [t1 , t1 + \u03c4 ) \u2282 I for some\nsmall \u03c4 > 0. Henceforth, we will work entirely on the slab [t1 , t1 + \u03c4 ) \u00d7 Rn . By\nshrinking \u03c4 as much as necessary, we may use the continuity and vanishing of v at\nt1 to assume\nkvkL\u221e \u1e22 1 \u2264 \u03b7\nt\n\nx\n\nwhere \u03b7 is a small absolute constant to be chosen later; in particular, from Sobolev\nembedding we have\n2n \u2264 \u03b7.\nkvk\u221e, n\u22122\nSimilarly, from the hypothesis u2 \u2208 \u1e60 1 (I \u00d7 Rn ) and Lemma 1.6 and (1.19) we may\ntake\nku2 k 2(n+2) , 2(n+2) . \u03b7.\nn\u22122\n\nn\u22122\n\nFrom (1.8) and the hypothesis u1 , u2 \u2208 Ct0 Hx1 , we easily see that\nZ t\nei(t\u2212s)\u2206 f (uj (s)) ds\nuj (t) = ei(t\u2212t1 ) uj (t1 ) \u2212 i\nt1\n\nfor j = 1, 2. Subtracting these and recalling that v(t1 ) = 0, we conclude that\nZ t\nei(t\u2212s)\u2206 (f (u1 (s)) \u2212 f (u2 (s))) ds.\nv(t) = \u2212i\nt1\n\nFrom (1.7) we have\n\nf (u1 (s)) \u2212 f (u2 (s)) = O(|v(s)|(n+2)/(n\u22122) ) + O(|u2 (s)|4/(n\u22122) |v(s)|).\n\n\f14\n\nTERENCE TAO AND MONICA VISAN\n\nApplying Lemmas 1.6 and 1.7 followed by H\u00f6lder's inequality, we conclude that\n(n+2)/(n\u22122)\n4/(n\u22122)\n2n . k|v|\n2n + k|u2 |\nkvk2, n\u22122\nk2, n+2\n|v|k 2(n+2) ,\nn+6\n\n2n(n+2)\nn2 +4n\u22124\n\n4/(n\u22122)\n2n + ku2 k 2(n+2) 2(n+2) )\n2n (kvk\n. kvk2, n\u22122\n\u221e, n\u22122\n,\nn\u22122\n\n.\u03b7\n\n4/(n\u22122)\n\nn\u22122\n\n2n .\nkvk2, n\u22122\n\n2n/(n\u22122)\n\n2n/(n\u22122)\n\nAs v was already finite in L\u221e\n(and hence in L2t Lx\n), we conclude\nt Lx\n(by taking \u03b7 small enough) that v vanishes almost everywhere on [t1 , t1 + \u03c4 ). This\nshows that \u03a9 is open in the forward direction. A similar argument establishes the\nopenness in the backwards direction, thus concluding the proof.\n\u0003\nRemark 2.4. By combining this uniqueness statement with the existence theorem,\none can show that for the Cauchy problem (1.1) there is a unique maximal interval\nI containing t0 , such that the slab I \u00d7 Rn supports a strong solution. Furthermore,\nI is open and the solution has finite \u1e86 (J \u00d7 Rn )-norm for any compact J \u2282 I. It is\nalso true that if I has a finite endpoint, then the \u1e86 -norm will blow up near that\nendpoint (see Lemma 2.6 below).\n2.5. Continuous dependence in rough norms. We turn now to the Lipschitz\nbound (1.21). Again we write v := u \u2212 \u0169.

This concludes the proof\nof Theorem 1.1.\n\u0003\nWe end this section with the following companion to Theorem 1.1.\nLemma 2.6 (Standard blowup criterion, [3], [4]).

In order to prove\nthe theorem in higher dimensions, we are forced to avoid taking a full derivative\nsince this is what turns the nonlinearity from Lipschitz into just H\u00f6lder continuous\n4\n4\n. Instead, we must take fewer than n\u22122\nderivatives. As we still need to\nof order n\u22122\n1\niterate in spaces that scale like \u1e60 , we either have to increase the space or the time\nintegrability of the usual Strichartz norms. The option of increasing the spatial\nintegrability is suggested by the exotic Strichartz estimates of Foschi, [8], but it\nturns out to be somewhat easier to increase the time integrability instead; this\nidea was used in the closely related context of the energy-critical non-linear KleinGordon equation by Nakanishi [18].

The reason we use these norms instead of the usual\n\u1e60 1 and \u1e44 1 norms is that they require roughly 4/(n + 2) < 4/(n \u2212 2) degrees\nof differentiability only, while still having the same scaling as the full-derivative\nspaces \u1e60 1 and \u1e44 1 .

As a consequence of this theorem, we\nwill derive scattering results. Let us start by proving that a finite bound of the\n2(n+2)\n\nLt,xn\u22122 -norm of the solution to (1.1) implies scattering. Indeed, we have\nCorollary 4.1 (Lpt,x bounds imply scattering). Let u0 \u2208 \u1e22x1 and let u be a global\nsolution to (1.1) such that\nkuk\n\n2(n+2)\nn\u22122\nLt,x\n(R\u00d7Rn )\n\n\u2264M\n\n(4.4)\n\nfor some constant M > 0. Then there exist finite energy solutions u\u00b1 (t, x) to the\nfree Schr\u00f6dinger equation (i\u2202t + \u2206)u\u00b1 = 0 such that\nku\u00b1 (t) \u2212 u(t)k\u1e22x1 \u2192 0\nas t \u2192 \u00b1\u221e. Furthermore, the maps u0 7\u2192 u\u00b1 (0) are continuous from \u1e22x1 to itself.\nProof. We will only prove the statement for u+ , since the proof for u\u2212 follows\nsimilarly. Let us first construct the scattering state u+ (0). For t > 0 define v(t) =\ne\u2212it\u2206 u(t). We will show that v(t) converges in \u1e22x1 as t \u2192 \u221e, and define u+ (0) to\nbe the limit. Indeed, from Duhamel's formula (1.42) we have\nZ t\ne\u2212is\u2206 f (u(s))ds.\n(4.5)\nv(t) = u(0) \u2212 i\n0\n\nTherefore, for 0 < \u03c4 < t,\n\nv(t) \u2212 v(\u03c4 ) = \u2212i\n\nZ\n\n\u03c4\n\nt\n\ne\u2212is\u2206 f (u(s))ds.\n\n\f28\n\nTERENCE TAO AND MONICA VISAN\n\nBy (1.14), (1.46), and Lemma 1.6, we have\nkv(t) \u2212 v(\u03c4 )k\u1e22 1 . kf (u)k\u1e44 1 ([\u03c4,t]\u00d7Rn)\nx\n\n4\n\n. kuk n\u22122\n2(n+2)\nn\u22122\n([\u03c4,t]\u00d7Rn )\nLt,x\n\nkuk\u1e86 ([\u03c4,t]\u00d7Rn )\n\n4\n\n. kuk n\u22122\n2(n+2)\nn\u22122\nLt,x\n([\u03c4,t]\u00d7Rn )\n\nkuk\u1e60 1 ([\u03c4,t]\u00d7Rn ) .\n\nHowever, (4.4) implies kuk\u1e60 1 (R\u00d7Rn ) \u2264 C(E, M ) by the same argument as in the\nproof of Theorem 1.4, where E denotes the kinetic energy of the initial data u0 .\nAlso by (4.4), for any \u03b7 > 0 there exists t\u03b7 \u2208 R+ such that\nkuk\n\n2(n+2)\nn\u22122\nLt,x\n([t,\u221e)\u00d7Rn )\n\n\u2264\u03b7\n\nwhenever t > t\u03b7 .

Also, inspecting (4.5) one\neasily sees that\nZ \u221e\nu+ (0) = u0 \u2212 i\ne\u2212is\u2206 f (u(s))ds\n(4.6)\n0\n\nand thus\n\nu+ (t) = eit\u2206 u0 \u2212 i\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nei(t\u2212s)\u2206 f (u(s))ds.\n\n(4.7)\n\n0\n\nBy the same arguments as above, (4.7) and Duhamel's formula (1.42) imply that\nku+ (t) \u2212 u(t)k\u1e22 1 \u2192 0 as t \u2192 \u221e.\nx\n\nSimilar estimates prove that the inverse wave operator u0 7\u2192 u+ (0) is continuous\nfrom \u1e22x1 to itself subject to the assumption (4.4) (in fact, we obtain a H\u00f6lder\ncontinuity estimate with this assumption). We skip the details.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.2. If we assume u0 \u2208 Hx1 in Corollary 4.1, then similar arguments\nyield scattering in Hx1 , i.e., there exist finite energy solutions u\u00b1 (t, x) to the free\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation (i\u2202t + \u2206)u\u00b1 = 0 such that\nku\u00b1 (t) \u2212 u(t)kHx1 \u2192 0 as t \u2192 \u00b1\u221e.\nRemark 4.3. If we knew that the problem (1.1) were globally wellposed for arbitrary \u1e22x1 (respectively Hx1 ) initial data, then standard arguments would also give\nasymptotic completeness, i.e., the maps u0 7\u2192 u\u00b1 (0) would be homeomorphisms\nfrom \u1e22x1 (respectively Hx1 ) to itself. See for instance [6] for this argument in the\nenergy-subcritical case.\nAs a consequence of Corollary 4.1 and the global well-posedness theory for small\ninitial data (see Corollary 1.2), we obtain scattering for solutions of (1.1) with\ninitial data small in the energy-norm \u1e22x1 :\n\n\fSTABILITY OF ENERGY-CRITICAL NLS\n\n29\n\nCorollary 4.4. Let u0 \u2208 Hx1 be such that\nku0 k\u1e22 1 . \u03b70\nx\n\nwith \u03b70 as in Theorem 1.1 and let u be the unique global solution to (1.1). Then there\nexist finite energy solutions u\u00b1 (t, x) to the free Schr\u00f6dinger equation (i\u2202t +\u2206)u\u00b1 = 0\nsuch that\nku\u00b1 (t) \u2212 u(t)kHx1 \u2192 0\nas t \u2192 \u00b1\u221e. Moreover, the maps u0 7\u2192 u\u00b1 (0) are continuous from Hx1 to itself (in\nfact, we have a H\u00f6lder continuity estimate).\nReferences\n[1] J.
