This work builds on a basic model of DeGroot [8], in which we imagine that each\nperson i holds an opinion equal to a real number zi , which might for example represent a position\non a political spectrum, or a probability that i assigns to a certain belief. There is a weighted graph\nG = (V, E) representing a social network, and node i is influenced by the opinions of her neighbors\nin G, with the edge weights reflecting the extent of this influence. Now, in each time step node i\nupdates her opinion to be a weighted average of her current opinion and the current opinions of\nher neighbors.\nThis body of work has developed a set of general conditions under which such processes will\nconverge to a state of consensus, in which all nodes hold the same opinion. This emphasis on\nconsensus, however, can only model a specific type of opinion dynamics, where the opinions of the\ngroup all come together. As the sociologist David Krackhardt has observed,\nWe should not ignore the fact that in the real world consensus is usually not reached. Recognizing this,\nmost traditional social network scientists do not focus on an equilibrium of consensus. They are instead\nmore likely to be concerned with explaining the lack of consensus (the variance) in beliefs and attitudes\nthat appears in actual social influence contexts [16].\n\nIn this paper we study a model of opinion dynamics in which consensus is not reached in general,\nwith the goal of quantifing the inherent social cost of this lack of consensus. To do this, we first\nneed a framework that captures some of the underlying reasons why consensus is not reached, as\nwell as a way of measuring the cost of disagreement.\nLack of Agreement and its Cost\nWe begin from a variation on the DeGroot model due to Friedkin and Johnsen [11], which posits\nthat each node i maintains a persistent internal opinion si . This internal opinion remains constant\neven as node i updates her overall opinion zi through averaging. More precisely, if wi,j \u2265 0 denotes\nthe weight on the edge (i, j) in G, then in one time step node i updates her opinion to be the\naverage\nP\nsi + j\u2208N (i) wi,j zj\nP\n,\n(1)\nzi =\n1 + j\u2208N (i) wi,j\n\nwhere N (i) denotes the set of neighbors of i in G. Note that, in general, the presence of si as a\nconstant in each iteration prevents repeated averaging from bringing all nodes to the same opinion.\nIn this way, the model distinguishes between an individual's intrinsic belief si and her overall\nopinion zi ; the latter represents a compromise between the persistent value of si and the expressed\nopinions of others to whom i is connected. This distinction between si and zi also has parallels\nin empirical work that seeks to trace deeply held opinions such as political orientations back to\ndifferences in education and background, and even to explore genetic bases for such patterns of\nvariation [3].\nNow, if consensus is not reached, how should we quantify the cost of this lack of consensus? Here\nwe observe that since the standard models use averaging as their basic mechanism, we can equivalently view nodes' actions in each time step as myopically optimizing a quadratic cost function:\n\n1\n\n\fUpdating zi as in Equation (1) is the same as choosing zi to minimize\nX\n(zi \u2212 si )2 +\nwi,j (zi \u2212 zj )2 .\n\n(2)\n\nj\u2208N (i)\n\nWe therefore take this as the cost that i incurs by choosing a given value of zi , so that averaging\nbecomes a form of cost minimization.\nGiven this view, we can think of repeated averaging as the trajectory of best-response dynamics\nin a one-shot, complete information game played by the nodes in V , where i's strategy is a choice\nof opinion zi , and her payoff is the negative of the cost in Equation (2).\nNash Equilibrium and Social Optimality in a Game of Opinion Formation\nIn this model, repeated averaging does converge to the unique Nash equilibrium of the game defined\nby the individual cost functions in (2): each node i has an opinion xi that is the weighted average\nof i's internal opinion and the (equilibrium) opinions of i's neighbors. This equilibrium will not in\ngeneral correspond to the social optimum, the vector of\u0010node opinions y that minimizes the\n\u0011 social\nP\nP\n2\n2\ncost, defined to be sum of all players' costs: c(y) = i (yi \u2212 si ) + j\u2208N (i) wi,j (yi \u2212 yj ) .\nThe sub-optimality of the Nash equilibrium can be viewed in terms of the externality created\nby a player's personal optimization: by refusing to move further toward their neighbors' opinions,\nplayers can cause additional cost to be incurred by these neighbors. In fact we can view the\nproblem of minimizing social cost for this game as a type of metric labeling problem [6, 15], albeit a\npolynomial-time solvable case of the problem with a non-metric quadratic distance function on the\nreal numbers: we seek node labels that balance the value of a cost function at each node (capturing\ndisagreement with node-level information) and a cost function for label disagreement across edges.\nViewed this way, the sub-optimality of Nash equilibrium becomes a kind of sub-optimality for local\noptimization.\nA natural question for this game is thus the price of anarchy, defined as the ratio between the\ncost of the Nash equilibrium and the cost of the optimal solution.\nOur Results: Undirected Graphs\nThe model we have described can be used as stated in both undirected and directed graphs - the\nonly difference is in whether i's neighbor set N (i) represents the nodes with whom i is connected\nby undirected edges, or to whom i links with directed edges. However, the behavior of the price\nof anarchy is very different in undirected and directed graphs, and so we analyze them separately,\nbeginning with the undirected case.\nAs an example of how a sub-optimal social cost can arise at equilibrium in an undirected graph,\nconsider the graph depicted in Figure 1 - a three-node path in which the nodes have internal\nopinions 0, 1/2, and 1 respectively. As shown in the figure, the ratio between the social cost of\nthe Nash equilibrium and the social optimum is 9/8. Intuitively, the reason for the higher cost of\nthe Nash equilibrium is that the center node - by symmetry - cannot usefully shift her opinion\nin either direction, and so to achieve optimality the two outer nodes need to compromise more\nthan they want to at equilibrium. This is a reflection of the externality discussed above, and it is\nthe qualitative source of sub-optimality in general for equilibrium opinions - nodes move in the\ndirection of their neighbors, but not sufficiently to achieve the globally minimum social cost.\nOur first result is that the very simple example in Figure 1 is in fact extremal for undirected\ngraphs: we show that for any undirected graph G and any internal opinions vector s, the price of\n2\n\n\fHIJK\nONML\n0\n\n1\nHIJK\nONML\n2\n\nHIJK\nONML\n1\n\n(a) internal opinions.\n\n1\nHIJK\nONML\n4\n\n1\nHIJK\nONML\n2\n\n3\nHIJK\nONML\n4\n\n(b) Nash equilibrium.\n\n1\nHIJK\nONML\n3\n\n1\nHIJK\nONML\n2\n\n2\nHIJK\nONML\n3\n\n(c) optimal solution.\n\nFigure 1: An example in which the two players on the sides do not compromise by the optimal amount,\ngiven that the player in the middle should not shift her opinion.

We prove this by casting the question as an extremal problem for quadratic\nforms, and analyzing the resulting structure using eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of G. From\nthis, we obtain a characterization of the set of graphs G for which some internal opinions vector s\nyields a price of anarchy of 9/8.\nWe show that this bound of 9/8 continues to hold even for some generalizations of the model -\nwhen nodes i have different coefficients wi on the cost terms for their internal opinions, and when\ncertain nodes are \"fixed\" and simply do not modify their opinions.\nOur Results: Directed Graphs\nWe next consider the case in which G is a directed graph; the form of the cost functions remains\nexactly the same, with directed edges playing the role of undirected ones, but the range of possible\nbehaviors in the model becomes very different. This is due to the fact that nodes can now exert\na large influence over the network without being influenced themselves. Indeed, as Matt Jackson\nhas observed, directed versions of repeated averaging models can naturally incorporate \"external\"\nmedia sources; we simply include nodes with no outgoing links, so that they maintain their internal\nopinion [14].\nWe first show that the spectral machinery developed for analyzing undirected graphs can be\nextended to the directed case; through an approach based on generalized eigenvalue problems we\ncan efficiently compute the maximum possible price of anarchy, over all choices of internal node\nopinions, on a given graph G. However, in contrast to the case of undirected graphs, the price of\nanarchy can be very large in some instances; the simple example in Figure 2 shows a case in which\nn \u2212 1 nodes with internal opinion 0 all link to a single node that has internal opinion 1 and no\nout-going edges, producing an in-directed star. As a result, the social cost of the Nash equilibrium\nis 12 (n \u2212 1), whereas the minimum social cost is at most 1, since the player at the center of the\nstar could simply shift her opinion to 0. Intuitively, this corresponds to a type of social network\nin which the whole group pays attention to a single influential \"leader\" or \"celebrity\"; this drags\npeople's opinions far from their internal opinions si , creating a large social cost. Unfortunately, the\nleader is essentially unaware of the people paying attention to her, and hence has no incentive to\n3\n\n\fmodify her opinion in a direction that could greatly reduce the social cost.\nIn Section 3 we show that a price of anarchy lower-bounded by a polynomial in n can in fact be\nachieved in directed graphs of constant degree, so this behavior is not simply a consequence of large\nin-degree. It thus becomes a basic question whether there are natural classes of directed graphs,\nand even bounded-degree directed graphs, for which a constant price of anarchy is achievable.\nUnweighted Eulerian directed graphs are a natural class to consider - first, because they\ngeneralize undirected graphs, and second, because they capture the idea that at least at a local\nlevel no node has an asymmetric effect on the system. We use our framework for directed graphs to\nderive two bounds on the price of anarchy of Eulerian graphs: For Eulerian graphs with maximum\ndegree \u2206 we obtain a bound of \u2206 + 1 on the price of anarchy. For the subclass of Eulerian\nasymmetric directed graphs1 with maximum degree \u2206 and edge expansion \u03b1, we show a bound of\nO(\u22062 \u03b1\u22122 ) on the price of anarchy.\nOur Results: Modifying the Network\nFinally, we consider an algorithmic problem within this framework of opinion formation. The\nquestion is the following: if we have the ability to modify the edges in the network (subject to\ncertain constraints), how should we do this to reduce the social cost of the Nash equilibrium by as\nmuch as possible? This is a natural question both as a self-contained issue within the mathematical\nframework of opinion formation, and also in the context of applications: many social media sites\novertly and algorithmically consider how to balance the mix of news content [2, 5, 17, 18] and also\nthe mix of social content [4, 19] that they expose their users to, so as to optimize user engagement\non the site.\nAdding edges to reduce the social cost has an intuitive basis: it seems natural that exposing\npeople to others with different opinions can reduce the extent of disagreement within the group.\nWhen one looks at the form of the social cost c(y), however, there is something slightly counterintuitive about the idea of adding edges to improve the situation: the social cost is a sum of\nquadratic terms, and by adding edges to G we are simply adding further quadratic terms to the\ncost. For this reason, in fact, adding edges to G can never improve the optimal social cost. But\nadding edges can improve the social cost of the Nash equilibrium, and sometimes by a significant\namount - the point is that adding terms to the cost function shifts the equilibrium itself, which\ncan sometimes more than offset the additional terms. For example, if we add a single edge from\nthe center of the star in Figure 2 to one of the leaves, then the center will shift her opinion to\n2/3 in equilibrium, causing all the leaves to shift their opinions to 1/3, and resulting in a \u0398(n)\nimprovement in the social cost. In this case, once the leader pays attention to even a single member\nof the group, the social cost improves dramatically.\nWe focus on three main variants on this question: when all edges must be added to a specific\nnode (as in the case when a site can modify the amount of attention directed to a media source\nor celebrity); when all edges must be added from a specific node (as in the case when a particular\nmedia site tries to shift its location in the space of opinions by blending in content from others);\nand when edges can be added between any pair of nodes in the network (as in the case when a social\nnetworking site evaluates modifications to its feeds of content from one user to another [4, 19]).\nIn Section 4 we show that, in the previously discussed variants, the problem of where to add\nedges to optimally reduce the social cost is NP-hard. But we obtain a set of positive results as well,\nincluding a 94 -approximation algorithm when edges can be added between arbitrary pairs of nodes,\n1\n\nAn Eulerian asymmetric directed graph is an Eulerian graph that does not contain any pair of oppositely oriented\nedges (i, j) and (j, i).\n\n4\n\n\fand an algorithm to find the optimal amount of additional weight to add to a given edge.\n\n2\n\nUndirected Graphs\n\nWe first consider the case of undirected graphs and later handle the more general case of directed\ngraphs. The main result in this section is a tight bound on the price of anarchy for the opinionformation game in undirected graphs. After this, we discuss two slight extensions to the model:\nin the first, each player can put a different amount of weight on her internal opinion; and in the\nsecond, each player has several fixed opinions she listens to instead of an internal opinion. We show\nthat both models can be reduced to the basic form of the model which we study first.\nFor undirected graphs we can simplify the social cost to the following form:\nX\nX\nc(z) =\n(zi \u2212 si )2 + 2\nwi,j (zi \u2212 zj )2 .\ni\n\n(i,j)\u2208E,i>j\n\nWe can write this concisely P\nin matrix form, by using the weighted Laplacian matrix L of G. L\nis defined by setting Li,i = j\u2208N (i) wi,j and Li,j = \u2212wi,j . We can thus write the social cost as\nc(z) = z T Az + ||z \u2212 s||2 , where the matrix A = 2L captures the tension on the edges. The optimal\nsolution is the y minimizing c(*). By taking derivatives, we see that the optimal solution satisfies\n(A + I)y = s. Since the Laplacian of a graph is a positive semidefinite matrix, it follows that A + I\nis positive definite. Therefore, (A + I)y = s has a unique solution: y = (A + I)\u22121 s.\nIn the Nash equilibrium x each player chooses an opinion which minimizes her cost; in terms of\nthe derivatives of the cost functions, this implies that c\u2032i (x) = 0 for all i. Thus, to find the players'\nopinions\nin the Nash equilibrium we should solve the following system of equations: \u2200i (xi \u2212 si ) +\nP\nw\nj\u2208N (i) i,j (xi \u2212 xj ) = 0. Therefore in the Nash equilibrium each player holds an opinion which is\na weighted average of her internal opinion and the Nash equilibrium opinions of all her neighbors.\nThis can be succinctly written as (L + I)x = ( 21 A + I)x = s. As before 12 A + I is a positive definite\nmatrix, and hence the unique Nash equilibrium is x = ( 21 A + I)\u22121 s.\nWe now begin our discussion on the price of anarchy (PoA) of the opinion game - the ratio\nbetween the cost of the optimal solution and the cost of the Nash equilibrium.\nOur main theorem is that the price of anarchy of the opinion game is at most 9/8. Before\nproceeding to prove the theorem we present a simple upper bound of 2 on the PoA for undirected\ngraphs. To see why this holds, note that the Nash equilibrium actually minimizes the function\nz T ( 12 A)z+||z\u2212s||2 (one can verify that this function's partial derivatives are the system of equations\ndefining the Nash equilibrium). This allows us to write the following bound on the PoA:\nP oA =\n\nc(x)\nc(y)\n\n\u2264\n\u2264\n\u2264\n\n2(xT ( 21 A)x + ||x \u2212 s||2 )\nc(y)\n1\nT\n2(y ( 2 A)y + ||y \u2212 s||2 )\nc(y)\n2c(y)\n= 2.\nc(y)\n\nWe note that this bound holds only for the undirected case, as in the directed case the Nash\nequilibrium does not minimize z T ( 12 A)z + ||z \u2212 s||2 anymore.\nWe now state the main theorem of this section.\nTheorem 2.1 For any graph G and any internal opinions vector s, the price of anarchy of the\nopinion game is at most 9/8.\n5\n\n\fProof: The crux of the proof is relating the price of anarchy of an instance to the eigenvalues of its\nLaplacian. Specifically, we characterize the graphs and internal opinion vectors with maximal PoA.\nIn these worst-case instances at least one eigenvalue of the Laplacian is exactly 1, and the vector of\ninternal opinions is a linear combination of the eigenvectors associated with the eigenvalues 1, plus\na possible constant shift for each connected component. As a first step we consider two matrices B\nand C that arise by plugging the Nash equilibrium and optimal solution we previously computed\ninto the cost function and applying simple algebraic manipulations:\nc(y) = sT [(A + I)\u22121 \u2212 I)2 + (A + I)\u22121 A(A + I)\u22121 ]s\n{z\n}\n|\nB\n\n\u22121\n\nT\n\nc(x) = s [(L + I)\n|\n\n2\n\n\u2212 I) + (L + I)\u22121 A(L + I)\u22121 ]s.\n{z\n}\nC\n\nNext, we show that the matrices A, B, C are simultaneously diagonalizable: there exists an\northogonal matrix Q such that A = Q\u039bA QT , B = Q\u039bB QT and C = Q\u039bC QT , where for a matrix\nM\nM the notation \u039bM represents a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues \u03bbM\n1 , . . . , \u03bbn of M on the\ndiagonal.\nLemma 2.2 A,B and C are simultaneously diagonalizable by a matrix Q whose columns are eigenvectors of A.\nProof:\nIt is a standard fact that any real symmetric matrix M can be diagonalized by an\northogonal matrix Q such that M = Q\u039bM QT . Q's columns are eigenvectors of M which are\northogonal to each other and have a norm of one. Thus in order to show that A, B and C can be\ndiagonalized with the same matrix Q it is enough to show that all three are symmetric and have\nthe same eigenvectors. For this we use the following basic fact:\nIf \u03bbN is an eigenvalue of N , \u03bbM is an eigenvalue of M and w is an eigenvector of both\nthen:\n1.\n\n1\n\u03bb\n\nis an eigenvalue of M \u22121 and w is an eigenvector of M \u22121 .\n\n2. \u03bbN + \u03bbM is an eigenvalue of N + M and w is an eigenvector of N + M .\n3. \u03bbN * \u03bbM is an eigenvalue of N M and w is an eigenvector of N M .\nFrom this we can show that any eigenvector of A is also an eigenvector of B and C. Recall that\nA is a symmetric matrix, thus, it has n orthogonal eigenvectors which implies that A,B and C are\nall symmetric and share the same basis of eigenvectors. Therefore A,B and C are simultaneously\ndiagonalizable.\nWe can now express the PoA as a function of the eigenvalues of B and C. By defining s\u2032 = QT s\nwe have:\nP oA =\n=\n\nsT Cs\nsT Q\u039bC QT s\nc(x)\n= T\n= T\nc(y)\ns Bs\ns Q\u039bB QT s\nP\nn\nC \u20322\ns\u2032T \u039bC s\u2032\n\u03bbC\ni\ni=1 \u03bbi si\n\u2264\nmax\n=\nP\nn\nB s\u2032 2\ni \u03bbB\ns\u2032T \u039bB s\u2032\n\u03bb\ni\ni=1 i i\n\nB\nThe final step of the proof consists of expressing \u03bbC\ni and \u03bbi as functions of the eigenvalues of\nB\nA (denoted by \u03bbi ) and finding the value for \u03bbi maximizing the ratio between \u03bbC\ni and \u03bbi .\n\n6\n\n\fLemma 2.3 maxi\nProof:\nwe get:\n\n\u03bbC\ni\n\u2264 9/8. The bound is tight if and only if there exists an i such that \u03bbi = 2.\n\u03bbB\ni\n\nUsing the basic facts about eigenvalues which were mentioned in the proof of Lemma 2.2,\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\n1\n1\n\u03bbi\n\u03bbi + 1 \u03bbi + 1\n\u03bbi\n\u03bb2i + \u03bbi\n\u03bbi\n\u03bb2i\n+\n=\n=\n=\n2\n2\n2\n(\u03bbi + 1)\n(\u03bbi + 1)\n(\u03bbi + 1)\n(\u03bbi + 1)\n!2\n1\n1\n1\n\u03bbC\n\u03bbi 1\n+ 1\ni = 1\u2212 1\n2 \u03bbi + 1\n2 \u03bbi + 1\n2 \u03bbi + 1\n\n\u03bbB\ni =\n\n=\n\n1\u2212\n\n1\n\u03bbi + 1\n\n+\n\n\u03bb2i\n4\u03bbi\n\u03bb2i + 4\u03bbi\n+\n=\n.\n(\u03bbi + 2)2\n(\u03bbi + 2)2\n(\u03bbi + 2)2\n\nB\nWe can now write \u03bbC\ni /\u03bbi = \u03c6(\u03bbi ), where \u03c6 is a simple rational function:\n\n(\u03bb2 + 4\u03bb)/(\u03bb + 2)2\n(\u03bb2 + 4\u03bb)(\u03bb + 1)\n=\n\u03bb/(\u03bb + 1)\n(\u03bb + 2)2 \u03bb\n(\u03bb + 4)(\u03bb + 1)\n\u03bb2 + 5\u03bb + 4\n=\n.\n=\n(\u03bb + 2)2\n\u03bb2 + 4\u03bb + 4\n\n\u03c6(\u03bb) =\n\nBy taking the derivative of \u03c6, we find that \u03c6 is maximized over all \u03bb \u2265 0 at \u03bb = 2 and \u03c6(2) = 9/8.\nThe eigenvalues \u03bbi are all non-negative, so it is always true that maxi \u03c6(\u03bbi ) \u2264 9/8. If 2 is\nan eigenvalue of A (and hence 1 is an eigenvalue of the Laplacian) then there exists an internal\nopinions vector s for which the PoA is 9/8.\nWhat is the internal opinions vector maximizing the PoA? To find it assume that the ith\neigenvalue of the Laplacian equals 1. To get a PoA of 9/8 we should choose s\u2032i = 1 and \u2200j 6= i s\u2032j = 0\nto hit only \u03bbi . By definition s\u2032 = QT s, and hence s = (QT )\u22121 s\u2032 . Because Q is orthogonal,\nQT = Q\u22121 ; thus, s = Qs\u2032 = vi , where vi is the eigenvector associated with \u03bbi . In fact, any\nlinear combination of the eigenvectors associated with eigenvalues 0 and 1 where at least one of the\neigenvectors of 1 has a nonzero coefficient will obtain the maximal PoA.\nWith Lemma 2.3, we have completed the proof of Theorem 2.1.\nCorollary 2.4 We can scale the weights of any graph to make its PoA be 9/8. If \u03b1 is the scaling\nfactor for the weights, then the eigenvalues of the scaled A matrix are \u03b1\u03bbi . Therefore by choosing\n\u03b1 = \u03bb2i for any eigenvalue other than 0 we get that there exists an internal opinions vector for\nwhich the PoA is 9/8.\n\n2.1\n\nArbitrary Node Weights and Players with Fixed Opinions\n\nOur first extension is a model in which different people put different weights on their internal\nopinion. In this extension,\neach node in\nX\nXthe graph has a strictly positive weight wi and the cost\n2\nfunction is: c(z) =\n[wi (zi \u2212 si ) +\nwi,j (zi \u2212 zj )2 ]. The bound of 9/8 on the PoA holds\ni\n\nj\u2208N (i)\n\neven in this model. To see this, let w be the vector of node weights and d(w) be a diagonal\n\u221a\nmatrix with the values of w on the diagonal. In terms of the scaled variables \u1e91 = d( w )z,\n\u221a\n\u221a \u22121\n\u221a \u22121\n\u015d = d( w )s and the scaled matrix \u00c2 = d( w ) Ad( w ) , the cost takes the same form as\nbefore: c(\u1e91) = k\u1e91 \u2212 \u015dk2 + \u1e91 T \u00c2\u1e91. We have therefore proved:\n7\n\n\fClaim 2.5 The PoA of the game with arbitrary strictly positive node weights is bounded by 9/8.\nNext we show how to handle the case in which a subset of the players may have node weights\nof 0, which can equivalently be viewed as a set of players who have no internal opinion at all. We\nanalyze this by first considering the case in which all non-zero node weights are the same; for this\ncase we prove:\nLemma 2.6 If every player has either weight 1 or 0 on her internal opinion, then the PoA is\nbounded by 9/8.\nProof: Let Z be the set of players who do not have an internal opinion. We define the following\ndiagonal matrix R: Ri,i = 0 for i \u2208 Z and Rj,j = 1 for j \u2208\n/ Z. We assume without loss of generality\nthat Z 6= V since otherwise the PoA is 1. We can also assume without loss of generality that in\nthe instance which maximizes the PoA each i \u2208 Z has an internal opinion of 0. Therefore we can\nexpress the social cost as c(z) = ||z \u2212 s||2 + z T (A + R \u2212 I)z. Since the cost associated with all i \u2208\n/Z\nremains the same while for i \u2208 Z the cost of ||zi \u2212 si ||2 = zi2 is countered by the \u2212zi2 from the ith\nrow of z T (R \u2212 I)z. Similar to before we have that the optimal solution is y = (A + R)\u22121 s and the\nNash equilibrium is x = ( 12 A + R)\u22121 s. Since any real vector is an eigenvector of R we have that\n(A + R \u2212 I), (A + R) and ( 21 A + R) are simultaneously diagonalizable and therefore the same steps\nwe took to prove Theorem 2.1 lead us to get a bound of 9/8 for the PoA.\nBy applying the change of variables from Claim 2.5 we can also handle non-zero arbitrary\nweights.\nIn the second model we present, some nodes have fixed opinions and others do not have an\ninternal opinion at all. We partition the nodes into two sets A and B. Nodes in B are completely\nfixed in their opinion and are non-strategic, while nodes in A have no internal opinion \u2013 they\nsimply want to choose an opinion that minimizes their disagreement with their neighbors (which\nmay include a mix of nodes in A and B). We can think of nodes in A as people forming their\nopinion and of nodes in B as news sources with a specific fixed orientation. We denote the fixed\nopinion of a node j \u2208 B by sj . The social cost for this model is:\nX\nX\nc(z) =\n(zi \u2212 sj )2 + 2\n(zi \u2212 zj )2 .\n(i,j)\u2208E;\ni\u2208A;j\u2208B\n\n(i,j)\u2208E;\ni,j\u2208A;i>j\n\nNote that this clearly generalizes the original model, since we can construct a distinct node in\nB to represent each internal opinion. Next, we perform the reduction in the opposite direction,\nreducing this model to the basic model. To do this, we assign each node an internal opinion equal\nto the weighted average of the opinions of her fixed neighbors, and a weight equal to the sum of\nher fixed neighbors' weights. We then show that the PoA of the fixed opinion model is bounded by\nthe PoA of the basic model and thus get:\nProposition 2.7 The PoA of the fixed opinion model is at most 9/8.\nProof:\nWe reduce an instance of the fixed opinion game to an instance of the opinion game\nwith arbitrary node weights as follows: We define the internal opinion of every player i \u2208 A\nthat has\nP at least one neighbor in B to be a weighted average of the opinions i's neighbors in B:\nj\u2208N (i) wi,j sj\n, where NB (i) is the set of i's neighbors in B. We also define node i's weight\nsi = P B\nwi,j\nj\u2208NB\n(i)\nP\nto be wi = j\u2208NB (i) wi,j . For a player i \u2208 A who does not have any neighbors in B we simply\ndefine wi = 0. We use G to denote the initial instance, and G\u2032 to denote the instance produced\n8\n\n\fby the reduction. Let x be the Nash equilibrium in G; then x is also the Nash equilibrium in G\u2032 .\nTo see this, recall that in a Nash equilibrium each player's opinion is the weighed average of the\nopinions of all neighbors. Thus,\n\nxi =\n\nP\n\nP\nP\nwi,j sj\n( j\u2208NB (i) wi,j ) Pj\u2208NB (i) wi,j + j\u2208NA (i) wi,j yj\nj\u2208NB (i)\nj\u2208NB (i) wi,j sj +\nj\u2208NA (i) wi,j yj\nP\nP\nP\nP\n=\n.\nj\u2208NB (i) wi,j +\nj\u2208NA (i) wi,j\nj\u2208NB (i) wi,j +\nj\u2208NA (i) wi,j\n\nP\n\nP\n\nIn Claim 2.8 below we show that cG (z) = cG\u2032 (z) + c for a positive constant c, hence, the optimal\nsolution for G and G\u2032 is the same. Let y be this optimal solution and let x be G's and G\u2032 's Nash\nequilibrium. By deriving the following bound we conclude the proof:\nP oA(G) =\n\ncG (x)\ncG\u2032 (x)\n9\ncG\u2032 (x) + c\n\u2264\n\u2264 .\n\u2264\ncG (y)\ncG\u2032 (y) + c\ncG\u2032 (y)\n8\n\nClaim 2.8 cG (z) = cG\u2032 (z) + c where c is a positive constant.\nProof:\nWe show that cG (z) \u2265 cG\u2032 (z) and cG (z) \u2212 cG\u2032 (z) is constant. Observe that the only\nterms where the two costs differ are ones associated with the cost of the fixed opinions in G and\nthe internal opinions in G\u2032 . Thus, it is enough to show that for every player i:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n!2\nP\nX\nX\nw\ns\ni,j\nj\nj\u2208N (i)\nP B\n\u2212 zi .\nwi,j (sj \u2212 zi )2 \u2265 \uf8ed\nwi,j \uf8f8 *\nj\u2208NB (i) wi,j\nj\u2208NB (i)\n\nj\u2208NB (i)\n\nBy arranging the terms we\nPget that the terms involving zi 's cancel out, hence what left to show is\n( j\u2208NB (i) wi,j sj )2\nP\n2\nP\n.

Our main result in this section is that we can\nnevertheless develop spectral methods extending those in Section 2 to find internal opinions that\nmaximize the PoA for a given graph. Using this approach, we identify classes of directed graphs\nwith good PoA bounds.\nIn the introduction we have seen that the PoA of an in-directed star can be unbounded. As a\nfirst question, we ask whether this is solely a consequence of the unbounded maximum in-degree of\n9\n\n\fthis graph, or whether it is possible to have an unbounded PoA for a graph with bounded degrees.\nOur next example shows that one can obtain a large PoA even when all degrees are bounded: we\nshow that the PoA of a bounded degree tree can be \u0398(nc ), where c \u2264 1 is a constant depending on\nthe in-degrees of the nodes in the tree.\nExample 3.1 Let G be a 2k -ary tree of depth log2k n in which the internal opinion of the root is\n1 and the internal opinion of every other node is 0. All edges are directed toward the root. In the\nNash equilibrium all nodes at layer i hold the same opinion, which is 2\u2212i . (The root is defined\nto be at layer 0.) The cost of a node at layer i is 2 * 2\u22122i . Since there are 2ik nodes at layer i,\nlog2k n\nlog2k n\nX\nX\nik 1\u22122i\nthe total social cost at Nash equilibrium is\n2 2\n=2\n2(k\u22122)i . For k > 2 this cost is\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nk\u22122\n\nn k \u22121\n(2k\u22122 )log2k n \u2212 1\n= 2k\u22121 k\u22122\n. The cost of the optimal solution is at most 1; in fact it is\n2k\u22121\nk\u22122\n2\n\u22121\n2\n\u22121\nvery close to 1, since in order to reduce the cost the root should hold an opinion of \u01eb very close to\nk\u22122\n0, which makes the root's cost approximately 1. Therefore the PoA is \u0398(n k ). It is instructive to\nconsider the PoA for extreme values of k. For k = 2, the PoA is \u0398(log n), while for k = log n we\nrecover the in-directed star from the introduction where the PoA is \u0398(n). For intermediate values\n1\nof k, the PoA is \u0398(nc ). For example, for k = 3 we get that the PoA is \u0398(n 3 ).\n\nFor directed graphs we do not consider the generalization to arbitrary node weights (along the\nlines of Section 2.1), noting instead that introducing node weights to directed graphs can have a\nsevere effect on the PoA. That is, even in graphs containing only two nodes, introducing arbitrary\nnode weights can make the PoA unbounded. For example, consider a graph with two nodes i and\nj. Node i has an internal opinion of 0 and a node weight of 1, while node j has an internal opinion\nof 1 and a node weight of \u01eb. There is a directed edge (i, j) with weight 1. There cost of the Nash\nequilibrium is 1/2, but the social cost of the optimal solution is smaller than \u01eb. To avoid this\npathology, from now on we restrict our attention to uniform node weights.\n\n3.1\n\nThe Price of Anarchy in a General Graph\n\nFor directed graphs the cost of the optimal solution and the cost of the Nash equilibrium are\nrespectively c(y) = sT Bs and c(x) = sT Cs, as before. But now, C has a slightly more complicated\nform since L is no longer a symmetric matrix. Recall that matrix A is used in the social cost function\nto capture the cost associated with the edges of the graph (disagreement between neighbors).\nWe\nP\ndefine\nit\nfor\ndirected\ngraph\nby\nsetting\nA\n=\n\u2212w\n\u2212\nw\nfor\ni\n=\n6\nj\nand\nA\n=\nw\ni,j\ni,j\nj,i\ni,i\nj\u2208N (i) i,j +\nP\n{j|i\u2208N (j)} wj,i . The matrix A is the weighted Laplacian for an undirected graph where the weight\non the undirected edge (i, j) is the sum of the weights in the directed graph for edges (i, j) and\n\u0001T\n\u0001\n(j, i). We then define C = (L + I)\u22121 \u2212 I\n(L + I)\u22121 \u2212 I + (L + I)\u2212T A(L + I)\u22121 . The price of\nsT Cs\nas before. The primary distinction between the price of anarchy in the\nanarchy, therefore, is T\ns Bs\ndirected and undirected cases is that in the undirected case, B and C are both rational functions\nof A. In the directed case, no such simple relation exists between B and C, so that we cannot\neasily bound the generalized eigenvalues for the pair (and hence the price of anarchy) for arbitrary\ngraphs. However, given a directed graph our main theorem shows that we can always find the\nvector of internal opinions s yielding the maximum PoA:\nTheorem 3.2 Given a graph G it is possible to find the internal opinions vector s yielding the\nmaximum PoA up to a precision of \u01eb in polynomial time.\n10\n\n\fProof:\nThe total social cost is invariant under constant shifts in opinion. Therefore, without\nloss of generality, we restrict our attention to the space of opinion vectors with mean zero. Let\nus define a matrix P \u2208 Rn\u00d7(n\u22121) to have Pj,j = 1, Pj+1,j = \u22121, and Pi,j = 0 otherwise. The\ncolumns of P are a basis for the space of vectors with mean zero; that is, we can write any such\nvector as s = P \u015d for some \u015d. We also define matrices B\u0304 = P T BP and C\u0304 = P T CP , which are\npositive definite if the symmetrized graph is connected. The price of anarchy is then given by\nthe generalized Rayleigh quotient \u03c1C\u0304,B\u0304 (\u015d) = (\u015dT C\u0304 \u015d)/(\u015dT B\u0304\u015d). Stationary points of \u03c1C\u0304,B\u0304 satisfy the\ngeneralized eigenvalue equation (C \u2212 \u03c1C\u0304,B\u0304 (\u015d)B\u0304)\u015d = 0. In particular, the price of anarchy is the\nlargest generalized eigenvalue, and the associated eigenvector \u015d\u2217 corresponds to the maximizing\nchoice of internal opinions.\nThe solution of generalized eigenvalue problems is a standard technique in numerical linear\nalgebra, and there are good algorithms that run in polynomial time; see [13, \u00a78.7]. In particular,\nbecause B\u0304 is symmetric and positive definite, we can use the Cholesky factorization B\u0304 = RT R to\nreduce the problem to the standard eigenvalue problem (R\u2212T C\u0304R\u22121 \u2212 \u03bbI)(R\u015d) = 0.\n\n3.2\n\nUpper Bounds for Classes of Graphs\n\nOur goal in this section is rather simple: we would like to find families of graphs for which we can\nbound the price of anarchy. The main tool we use is bounding the cost of the Nash equilibrium by\na function of a simple structure. By using a function that has a similar structure to the social cost\nfunction we are able to frame the bound as a generalized eigenvalue problem that can be solved\nusing techniques similar to the ones that were used in proving Theorem 2.1.\nProposition 3.3 Let G be a graph family for which there exists a \u03b2 such that for any G \u2208 G and\nany internal opinions vector s, we have c(x) \u2264 minz (\u03b2(z T Az) + ||z \u2212 s||2 ). Then, \u2200G \u2208 G and\n2\nopinion vectors s, PoA(G) \u2264 \u03b2+\u03b2\u03bb\n1+\u03b2\u03bb2 , where \u03bb2 is the second smallest eigenvalue of A.\nProof: Let \u1ef9 be the vector minimizing \u03b2(z T Az) + ||z \u2212 s||2 . We can derive the following bound\non the price of anarchy:\nP oA(G) =\n\nc(x)\n\u03b2(\u1ef9 T A\u1ef9) + ||\u1ef9 \u2212 s||2\nsT Cs\n\u2264\n=\n,\nc(y)\n(y T Ay) + ||y \u2212 s||2\nsT Bs\n\nwhere C and B are defined similarly to the matrices in Theorem 2.1 and are simultaneously diago\u03b2\u03bbi\n\u03bbi\nC\nnalizable. If \u03bbi is an eigenvalue of A then \u03bbB\ni = 1+\u03bbi and \u03bbi = 1+\u03b2\u03bbi . As before, the maximum PoA\n\u03b2\u03bbi +\u03b2\n\u03b2\u03bbi\n\u03bbi\nB\nis achieved when \u03bbC\ni /\u03bbi = 1+\u03b2\u03bbi / 1+\u03bbi = \u03b2\u03bbi +1 is maximized. The maximum here is taken over\nall eigenvalues different than 0 as we know that the PoA for the internal opinions vector associated\nwith eigenvalue 0 (which is a constant vector) is 1. Therefore, the maximizing eigenvalue is \u03bb2 .\n\nAn immediate corollary is that if there exists a \u03b2 as in Proposition 3.3 then the PoA is bounded\nby this \u03b2.\nWe say that a bounded degree asymmetric expander is an unweighted directed graph that does\nnot contain any pair of oppositely oriented edges (i, j) and (j, i), and whose symmetrized graph\nhas maximum degree \u2206 and edge expansion \u03b1. We show:\nClaim 3.4 For a bounded degree asymmetric expander the PoA is bounded by O(\u22062 /\u03b12 ).\nProof: For an asymmetric graph, the matrix A is simply the Laplacian of the underlying graph;\nthis is why we require in the claim that the graph is asymmetric.\n11\n\n\fIf \u2206 is the maximum degree, then we have \u03bb2 \u2264 \u03bbn \u2264 \u2206. We also have that \u03bb2 \u2265 \u03b12 /2\u2206 [7].\nWe can now use this to bound the PoA in terms of the graph's expansion as follows:\n\u03b2 + \u03b2\u03bb2\n1 + \u03bb2\n2\u2206(1 + \u2206)\n\u03b2 + \u03b2\u03bb2\n\u2264\n\u2264\n\u2264\n= O(\u22062 /\u03b12 ).\n1 + \u03b2\u03bb2\n\u03b2\u03bb2\n\u03bb2\n\u03b12\nThe next natural question is for which graph families such a \u03b2 exists. Intuitively, such a \u03b2\nexists whenever the cost of the Nash equilibrium is smaller than the cost of the best consensus -\nthat is, the optimal solution restricted to opinion vectors in which all players hold the same opinion\n(constant vectors). This is true since the function \u03b2(z T Az) + ||z \u2212 s||2 is the social cost function of\na network in which the weights of all edges have been multiplied by \u03b2. However using this intuition\nfor finding graph families for which \u03b2 exists is difficult and furthermore does not help in computing\nthe value of \u03b2 (or a bound on it). Hence, we take a different approach. In Lemma 3.5, we introduce\nan intermediate function g(*) with the special property that its minimum value is the same as the\ncost of the Nash equilibrium. By showing that there exists a \u03b2 such that g(z) \u2264 \u03b2z T Az+||z\u2212s||2 we\nare able to present bounds for Eulerian bounded-degree graphs and additional bounds for Eulerian\nbounded-degree asymmetric expanders. As a first step, we use Schur complements to prove the\nfollowing:\nLemma 3.5 Let g(z) = z T M z + ||z \u2212 s||2 with M = (I \u2212 C)\u22121 \u2212 I. If (I \u2212 C) is nonsingular then\nfor the Nash equilibrium x, we have minz g(z) = c(x).\nProof: The social cost is a quadratic function of the expressed opinion vector and the internal\nopinion vector:\n\u0014 \u0015T \u0014\n\u0015\u0014 \u0015\nz\nA + I \u2212I z\nT\n2\nc(z) = z Az + kz \u2212 sk =\n.\ns\n\u2212I\nI\ns\n\nTo compute the socially optimal vector, we minimize this quadratic form in z and s subject to\nconstraints on s. This yields c(y) = sT Bs, where the matrix\nB = ((A + I)\u22121 \u2212 I)2 + (A + I)\u22121 A(A + I)\u22121 = I \u2212 (A + I)\u22121\nis a Schur complement in the larger system2 . Schur complements typically arise in partial elimination of variables from linear systems. In this case, we have eliminated the z variables in the\nstationary equations for a critical point in the extended quadratic form.\nNow consider the Nash equilibrium. As we assume that (I \u2212 C) is invertible, we can define\nM = (I \u2212 C)\u22121 \u2212 I.\n\nThe matrix M is symmetric and positive semidefinite, with a null space consisting of the constant\nvectors. That is, we can see M as the Laplacian of a new graph. By design, C = I \u2212 (M + I)\u22121 ,\nso we can mimic the construction above to express C as a Schur complement in a larger system.\nThus, the social cost of the Nash equilibrium can be written\n\u0014 \u0015T \u0014\n\u0015\u0014 \u0015\nz\nM + I \u2212I z\nc(x) = min\n,\nz\ns\n\u2212I\nI\ns\nwhich is the optimal social cost in the new network.\nWe then complement the lemma by showing that for Eulerian graphs (I \u2212 C) is nonsingular\nand furthermore the matrix M has a nice structure:\n2\n\nRecall that the Schur complement of the block A of the matrix\n\n12\n\n\u0014\n\nA\nC\n\n\u0015\nB\nis D \u2212 CA\u22121 B.\nD\n\n\fClaim 3.6 For Eulerian graphs M = A + LLT .\nProof:\n\nWe denote L\u0303 = L + I and \u00c3 = A + I then:\nI \u2212 C = I \u2212 (L\u0303\u22121 \u2212 I)T (L\u0303\u22121 \u2212 I) \u2212 L\u0303\u2212T (\u00c3 \u2212 I)L\u0303\u22121\n= L\u0303\u22121 + L\u0303\u2212T \u2212 L\u0303\u2212T \u00c3L\u0303\u22121 .\n\nWe use the fact that for Eulerian graphs A = L + LT which implies that \u00c3 = L\u0303 + L\u0303T \u2212 I to simplify\nI \u2212 C:\nI \u2212 C = L\u0303\u22121 + L\u0303\u2212T \u2212 L\u0303\u2212T (L\u0303 + L\u0303T \u2212 I)L\u0303\u22121\n= L\u0303\u2212T L\u0303\u22121 .\n\nWe have that M = (L + I)(L + I)T \u2212 I = A + LLT . Let us understand what the matrix LLT\nT ] = d2 + d where d is the degree of node i and off the\nlooks like. On the diagonal we have [LL\ni,i\ni\ni\ni\nP\ndiagonal [LLT ]i,j = di Lj,i + dj Li,j + k6=i,j (Li,k Lj,k ) = di Lj,i + dj Li,j + |N (i) \u2229 N (j)|.\nRecall that \u2206 is the he maximum degree of an Eulerian graph. We are now ready to prove the\nfollowing proposition:\nProposition 3.7 For Eulerian graphs c(x) \u2264 (\u2206 + 1)(z T Az) + ||z \u2212 s||2 .\nProof:\nBy Lemma 3.5 and Claim 3.6 we have that for Eulerian graphs c(x) = minz g(z) =\nminz z T (A + LLT )z + ||z \u2212 s||2 . What remains to show is that for \u03b2 = \u2206 + 1 it holds that\ng(z) \u2264 \u03b2z T Az + ||z \u2212 s||2 . After some rearranging this boils down to showing that the following\nholds z T LLT z \u2264 (\u03b2 \u2212 1)z T Az\nNote that A is the Laplacian for a symmetrized version of the graph; assuming this graph is\nconnected (since otherwise we can work separately in each component), this means A has one zero\neigenvalue corresponding to the constant vectors, and is positive definite on the space orthogonal\nto the constant vector. Similarly, LLT has a zero eigenvalue corresponding to the constant vectors,\nand is at least positive semi-definite on the space orthogonal to the constant vectors. Since A is\npositive definite on the space of nonconstant vectors, the smallest possible \u03b2 can be computed via\nthe solution of a generalized eigenvalue problem\nz T LLT z\n.\nz6=\u03b1e z T Az\n\n\u03b2 = 1 + max\n\nIn the case of an unweighted graph, one get a bound via norm inequalities. Using the fact that\nthe graph is Eulerian, LT is also a graph Laplacian, and we can write\nT\n\nL z\nso\n\n\u0001\n\nz T LLT z =\n\ni\n\n=\n\nn\nX\nj=1\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\nwj,i (zi \u2212 zj ),\n\nn\nX\nj=1\n\nSimilarly, we expand the quadratic form z T Az into\n\n\uf8f62\n\nwj,i (zi \u2212 zj )\uf8f8 .\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nn\nn\nX\nX\nX\n\uf8ed\nwj,i (zi \u2212 zj )2 \uf8f8 .\nz T Az =\n(wi,j + wj,i )(zi \u2212 zj )2 =\ni=1\n\ni<j\n\n13\n\nj=1\n\n\f\u0010P\n\u00112\nP\nd\nNow, recall that in general\nx\n\u2264 d dj=1 x2j , which means that in the unweighted case\nj=1 j\n\u0010P\n\u0011\n\u00112\n\u0010P\nP\nn\nn\n2 . where d =\nw\n(z\n\u2212\nz\n)\n\u2264\nd\nw\n(z\n\u2212\nz\n)\ni\nj,i\ni\nj\ni\nj,i\ni\nj\nj wj,i is the in-degree or out-degree.\nj=1\nj=1\nTherefore,\nPn\nPn\n2\nz T LLT z\ni=1 di\nj=1 wj,i (zi \u2212 zj )\nP\nP\n\u2264\n\u2264 max di = \u2206.\nn\nn\n2\ni\nz T Az\ni=1\nj=1 wj,i (zi \u2212 zj )\n\nSo for a general Eulerian graph, \u03b2 \u2264 1 + \u2206.\n\nWe observe that for a cycle the bound of 2 on the price of anarchy is actually tight:\nObservation 3.8 The PoA of a directed cycle is bounded by 2 and approaches 2 as the size of the\ncycle grows.\nProof: For a cycle it is the case that A = LLT ; therefore g(z) = 2(z T Az) + ||z \u2212 s||2 , and hence\nthe bound assumed in Proposition 3.3 is actually a tight bound. In order to show that the PoA\nindeed approaches 2 we need to show that \u03bb2 approaches 0 as the size of the cycle grows. The fact\nthat A is the Laplacian of an undirected cycle comes to our aid and provide us an exact formula\nfor \u03bb2 : \u03bb2 = 2(1 \u2212 cos( 2\u03c0\nn )) (where n is the size of the cycle), and this concludes the proof.\nFor general Eulerian graphs we leave open the question of whether the bound of \u2206 + 1 is a tight\nbound or not. Indeed, it is an intriguing open question whether there exists a Eulerian graph with\nPoA greater than 2.\n\n4\n\nAdding Edges to the Graph\n\nThe next thing we consider is the following class of problems: Given an unweighted graph G and a\nvector of internal opinions s, find edges E \u2032 to add to G so as to minimize the social cost of the Nash\nequilibrium. We begin with a general bound linking the possible improvement from adding edges\nto the price of anarchy. Let G be a graph (either undirected or directed). Denote by cG (*) the cost\nfunction and by x and y the Nash equilibrium and optimal solution respectively. Let G\u2032 be the\ncG (x)\ncG (x)\ncG (x)\n\u2264\n\u2264\n= PoA(G). To see why\ngraph constructed by adding edges to G. Then:\ncG\u2032 (x\u2032 )\ncG\u2032 (y \u2032 )\ncG (y)\nthis is the case, we first note that cG\u2032 (y \u2032 ) \u2264 cG\u2032 (x\u2032 ) since the cost of the Nash equilibrium cannot\nbe smaller than the optimal solution. Second, cG (y) \u2264 cG\u2032 (y \u2032 ) simply because cG\u2032 (*) contains more\nterms than cG (*). Therefore we have proved the following proposition:\nProposition 4.1 Adding edges to a graph G can improve the cost of the Nash equilibrium by a\nmultiplicative factor of at most the PoA of G.\nWe study three variants on the problem, discussed in the introduction. In all variants, we seek\nthe \"best\" edges to add in order to minimize the social cost of the Nash equilibrium. The variants\ndiffer mainly in the types of edges we may add.\nAdding edges from a specific node\nFirst, we consider the case in which we can only add edges from a specific node w. Here we imagine\nthat node w is a media source that therefore does not have any cost for holding an opinion, and so\nwe will use a cost function that ignores the cost associated with it when computing the social cost.\nHence, our goal is to find a set of nodes F such that adding edges from node w to all the nodes in\n14\n\n\fF minimizes the cost of the Nash equilibrium while ignoring the cost exhibited by w. By reducing\nthe subset sum problem to this problem we show that:\nProposition 4.2 Finding the best set of edges to add from a specific node w is NP-hard.\nProof: Denote by G + F the graph constructed by adding to G edges from w to all nodes in\nF . Our goal is to find a set F minimizing c\u0303G+F (x), where x is a Nash equilibrium in the graph\nG + F and c\u0303 denotes the total cost of all nodes in x except for node w. We show that finding\nthis set is NP-hard by reducing the subset sum problem to this problem. Recall that in the subset\nsum problem we are given a set of positive P\nintegers a1 , . . . , an and a number t. We would like to\nknow if there exists any subset S such that j\u2208S aj = t. Given an instance of the subset problem,\nwe reduce it to the following instance of the opinion game. The instance conatins an in-directed\nstar with n peripheral nodes that have an internal opinion of 0 and a center node w which has an\ninternal opinion of 1 and n isolated nodes that have internal opinions of \u2212 ati .\nLemma 4.3 For the graph G and the vector of internal opinions s defined above, there exists a set\nF such that c\u0303G+F (x) = 0 if and only if the answer to the subset problem is yes.\nAs seen in the introduction, in the Nash equilibriumPeach one of the peripheral nodes\n1 + j\u2208F sj\nholds an opinion of 21 xw . Node w hold an opinion of xw =\n. Therefore the cost of the\n1 + |F |\nNash equilibrium in G + F is:\nP\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n1 + j\u2208F sj 2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n.\nc\u0303G+F (x) = n ( xw \u2212 0) + (xw \u2212 xw ) = 2n\n2\n2\n2(1 + |F |)\nProof:\n\nClearly\nthe cost is nonnegative as it is a sum of quadratic\nPterms; moreover it equals 0 if and only if\nP\n\u2032 = {j \u2208 F |s < 0}, we have\ns\n=\n\u22121.\nDefining\nF\n\u2032 s = \u22121. By the reduction we have\nj\nj\u2208FPj\nPj\u2208F j\naj\nthat j\u2208F \u2032 \u2212 t = \u22121; if we multiply by \u2212t we get that j\u2208F \u2032 aj = t implying that there exists a\nsolution to the subset sum problem.\nAdding edges to a specific node\nNext, we consider the case in which we can only add edges to a specific node. We can imagine\nagain that node w is a media source; in this case, however, our goal is to find the best set of people\nto expose to this media source. By reducing the minimum vertex cover problem to this problem\nwe show that:\nProposition 4.4 Finding the best set of edges to add to a specific node w is NP-hard.\nProof:\nGiven an instance of the minimum vertex cover problem, consisting of an undirected\ngraph G\u2032 = (V \u2032 , E \u2032 ), we construct an instance of the opinions game as follows:\n\u2022 For each edge (i, j) \u2208 E \u2032 we create a vertex vi,j with internal opinion 1.\n\u2022 For every vi,j we create an in-directed star with 24 peripheral nodes that have an internal\nopinion of 0. We later refer to node vi,j and all the nodes directed to it as vi,j 's star.\n\u2022 For each vertex i \u2208 V \u2032 we create a vertex ui with internal opinion 1.\n\u2022 For each edge (i, j) \u2208 E \u2032 we create directed edges (vi,j , ui ) and (vi,j , uj ).\n15\n\n\f\u2022 We create an isolated node w with internal opinion \u22123.\n\nLet T be the set of vertices such that adding edges from all the nodes in T to node w minimizes\nthe cost of the Nash equilibrium. Denote by G + T the graph constructed by adding to G edges\nfrom all nodes in T to w. Observe that T cannot contain any nodes with internal opinion of 0 as\nadding an edge from a node with internal opinion 0 to w which has internal opinion \u22123 can only\nincrease the cost of the Nash equilibrium. Thus, T contains only vertices of type vi,j and ui . In\nthe table in Figure 3 we compute vi,j 's opinion in the Nash equilibrium and the cost of its star as\na function of which vertices that influence vi,j are in T . For example in the first row we consider\nthe case in which vi,j , ui , uj \u2208\n/ T . In this case, vi,j 's opinion is (1 + 1 + 1)/3 = 1 and the cost of its\n1\nstar is 2 * 24 = 12. We use the costs in this table to reason about the structure of T and the cost\nof the Nash equilibrium in G + T .\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\nConfiguration\nvi,j , ui , uj \u2208\n/T\nvi,j \u2208 T, ui , uj \u2208\n/T\nvi,j , ui \u2208 T, uj \u2208\n/T\nvi,j , ui , uj \u2208 T\nvi,j , uj \u2208\n/ T, ui \u2208 T\nvi,j \u2208\n/ T, ui , uj \u2208 T\n\nvi,j 's opinion\n1\n0\n\u22121/2\n\u22121\n1/3\n\u22121/3\n\nvi,j 's star cost\n12\n12\n14\n20\n4\n4\n\nFigure 3: The total cost of vi,j 's star for different configurations\nIn Lemma 4.5 we show how to construct from T a set T \u2032 such that cG+T \u2032 (x\u2032 ) = cG+T (x) and T \u2032\nis a pseudo vertex cover. We say that a set T \u2032 is a pseudo vertex cover if it obeys two properties:\nfirst, it contains only vertices of the type ui . Second, the vertices in V \u2032 corresponding to the ui 's\nin V constitute a vertex cover in G\u2032 .\nNext, we consider the cost of the Nash equilibrium in the graph G + S where S is a pseudo\nvertex cover: By the table in Figure 3 we have the cost associated with every vi,j 's star is 4. This\nis by the fact that S is a pseudo vertex cover and hence the only applicable cases are 5 and 6, in\nboth cases the total cost of vi,j 's star is 4. Also, note that the cost for each ui \u2208 S is 8. Hence, the\ntotal cost of the Nash equilibrium for network G + S is f (S) = 4|E| + 8|S|. By construction, T \u2032\nis a pseudo vertex cover and it also minimizes f (*), since cG+T (x) = cG+T \u2032 (x\u2032 ) = 4|E| + 8|T \u2032 | and\nT is optimal. Therefore T \u2032 corresponds to a minimum vertex cover in G\u2032 . A key element in this\nreduction is the property that the cost of vi,j 's star is the same, whether ui \u2208 T \u2032 or both ui and uj\nbelong to T \u2032 .\nLemma 4.5 There exists a pseudo vertex cover T \u2032 such that cG+T \u2032 (x\u2032 ) = cG+T (x)\nProof: First, we obtain T \u2032\u2032 by removing from T all vertices of type vi,j . We have that cG+T \u2032\u2032 (x\u2032\u2032 ) \u2264\ncG+T (x) since by examining the table in Figure 3 we observe that including vertices of type vi,j in\nT \u2032\u2032 can only increase the cost of the Nash equilibrium. Since T is optimal, it has to be the case that\n/ T \u2032\u2032\ncG+T \u2032\u2032 (x\u2032\u2032 ) = cG+T (x). Next, to get T \u2032 we take T \u2032\u2032 and for each vertex vi,j such that ui , uj \u2208\nwe add ui to T \u2032 . By adding these vertices we have not increased the cost since in the worst case\nvi,j 's star and ui have a total cost of 12 which is the same as their previous total cost. As before\nby the optimality of T we could not have reduced the cost by adding the vertices, therefore it still\nholds that cG+T \u2032 (x\u2032 ) = cG+T (x). To complete the proof observe that by construction T \u2032 is a pseudo\nvertex cover.\n\n16\n\n\fAdding an arbitrary set of edges\nIn the last case we consider, which is the most general one, we can add any set of edges. For this\ncase we leave open the question of the hardness of adding an unrestricted set of edges. We do show\nthat finding the best set of k arbitrary edges is NP-hard. This is done by a reduction from k-dense\nsubgraph [10] :\nProposition 4.6 Finding a best set of arbitrary k edges is NP-hard.\nProof: We show a reduction from the \"Dense k-Subgraph Problem\" defined in [10]: given an\nundirected graph G\u2032 = (V \u2032 , E \u2032 ) and a parameter k, find a set of k vertices with maximum average\ndegree in the subgraph induced by this set. Given an instance of the \"Dense k-Subgraph Problem\"\nwe create an instance of the opinion game as follows:\n\u2022 For every edge (i, j) \u2208 E \u2032 we create a node vi,j with internal opinion 0.\n\u2022 For every vertex i \u2208 V \u2032 we create a node ui with internal opinion 1.\n\u2022 For every vi,j we add directed edges (vi,j , ui ) and (vi,j , uj ).\n\u2022 For every ui we create an in-directed star with 20 peripheral nodes that have an internal\nopinion of 0.\n\u2022 Finally, we create a single isolated vertex w with internal opinion -1.\nThe proof is composed of two lemmas. In Lemma 4.7 we show that all edges in the minimizing set\nare of type (ui , w). Then we denote by T the set of nodes of type ui such that adding an edge from\neach one of these nodes to w minimizes the cost, and in Lemma 4.8 we show that T is a k densest\nsubgraph.\nLemma 4.7 The best set of edges to add contains only edges from nodes of type ui to w.\nProof: Our first observation is that any edge which is not from nodes of type ui affects the cost\nof at most one node. This is simply because all nodes in the graph, if affected by any node at\nall, are affected by nodes of type ui . The cost of each one of the nodes in the graph in the Nash\nequilibrium is at most 1, and therefore the improvement in the cost from adding any such edge is\nat most 1. On the other hand, adding an edge from nodes of type ui to w reduces the cost by at\nleast 21 20 \u2212 2(1 \u2212 0)2 = 8. It is easy to verify that adding edges from nodes of type ui to other\nnodes has a smaller effect on i's cost.\nLemma 4.8 The previously defined set T is a solution to the dense k-subgraph problem.\nProof: The key point is the fact that the cost associated with a node of type vi,j is 0 if and only\nif both ui and uj are in T ; otherwise this cost is exactly 32 . When ui \u2208 T , the opinion of ui in the\nNash equilibrium is 0 since it is averaging between 1 and \u22121. Therefore node vi,j 's associated cost\nin the Nash equilibrium is:\n\u2022 0 - if both ui and uj are in T - since vi,j holds opinion 0.\n2\n3\n\n\u2022\n\n- if both ui and uj are not in T - since vi,j 's opinion is\n2(1 \u2212 32 )2 = 23 .\n\n\u2022\n\n2\n3\n\n- if only one of ui , uj is in T - then vi,j 's opinion is\n(0 \u2212 31 )2 + (1 \u2212 13 )2 = 32 .\n17\n\n1\n3\n\n2\n3\n\nand therefore the cost is (0 \u2212 32 )2 +\n\nand therefore the cost is (0 \u2212 31 )2 +\n\n\fHence to minimize the cost of the Nash equilibrium we should choose a set T maximizing the\nnumber of nodes of type vi,j for which both ui and uj are in T . In the graph G\u2032 from the k-dense\nsubgraph problem that set T is a set of vertices and what we are looking for is the set T with an\ninduced graph that has the maximum number of edges. By definition this set is exactly a k-densest\nsubgraph.\nFinding approximation algorithms for all of the problems discussed in propositions 4.2, 4.4,\nand 4.6 is an interesting question. As a first step we offer a 94 -approximation for the problem of\noptimally adding edges to a directed graph G - a problem whose hardness for exact optimization\nwe do not know. The approximation algorithm works simply by including the reverse copy of every\nedge in G that is not already in G; this produces a bi-directed graph G\u2032 .\nClaim 4.9 cG\u2032 (x\u2032 ) \u2264 94 cG (y).\n\nProof: By Theorem 2.1 we have that cG\u2032 (x\u2032 ) \u2264 98 cG\u2032 (y \u2032 ). Also notice that in the worst case, in\norder to get from G to G\u2032 , we must double all the edges in G. Therefore cG\u2032 (y \u2032 ) \u2264 2cG (y). By\ncombining the two we have that cG\u2032 (x\u2032 ) \u2264 94 cG (y).\nFor weighted graphs we can also include reverse copies of edges that do appear in G and hence\nachieve an approximation ratio of 2 for analogous reasons.\n\n4.1\n\nAdding a Single Weighted Edge\n\nWe now consider how to optimally choose the weight to put on a single edge (i, j), to minimize the\ncost of the Nash equilibrium. Suppose we add weight \u03c1 to the edge (i, j). The modified Laplacian\nis L\u2032 = L + \u03c1ei (ei \u2212 ej )T , where ei is the ith vector in the standard basis. The modified Nash\nequilibrium is x\u2032 = (L\u2032 + I)\u22121 s = ((L + I) + \u03c1ei (ei \u2212 ej )T )\u22121 s.\nUsing the Sherman-Morrison formula for the rank-one update to an inverse [13, \u00a72.1.3], we have\n\u0015\n\u0014\n(L + I)\u22121 \u03c1ei (ei \u2212 ej )T (L + I)\u22121\n\u2032\n\u22121\ns\nx = (L + I) \u2212\n1 + \u03c1(ei \u2212 ej )T (L + I)\u22121 ei\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c1(xi \u2212 xj )\n,\n= x \u2212 vi\n1 + \u03c1(vi,i \u2212 vi,j )\n\nwhere vi = (L + I)\u22121 ei is the influence of si on the Nash opinions in the original graph. Therefore,\nvi gives the direction of change of the Nash equilibrium when the weight on (i, j) is increased: the\nequilibrium opinions all shift in the direction of vi . We prove the following key properties of this\ninfluence vector vi :\nLemma 4.10 The entries of vi = (L + I)\u22121 ei lie in [0, 1], and vi,i is the unique maximum entry.\n\nProof: The influence vector vi is simply the Nash equilibrium for the internal opinion vector ei .\nThe Nash equilibrium is the limit of repeated averaging starting from the internal opinions, and\nthe average of numbers in [0, 1] is in [0, 1]. Thus the entries of vi are in [0, 1].\nWe show that vi,i is the maximal entry by contradiction. Suppose vi,j is maximal for some\nj 6= i. Because L + I is nonsingular, vi cannot be the zero vector, so vi,j > 0. The equilibrium\nequations for j can be written\nP\nk\u2208N (j) wj,k vi,k\nP\nvi,j =\n1 + k\u2208N (j) wj,k\n!\nP\nk\u2208N (j) wj,k\nP\nmax vi,k \u2264 max vi,k\n\u2264\n1 + k\u2208N (j) wj,k k\u2208N (j)\nk\u2208N (j)\n18\n\n\fwhere the final inequality is strict if vi,k 6= 0 for any k \u2208 N (j). But vi,k 6= 0 for some k \u2208 N (j),\nsince otherwise vi,j would be zero. Therefore, there must be some k \u2208 N (j) such that vi,k > vi,j ,\nwhich contradicts the hypothesis that vi,j is maximal.\nWe now show how to choose the optimal weight \u03c1 to add to edge (i, j) to best reduce the social\ncost of the Nash equilbrium.\nTheorem 4.11 The optimal weight \u03c1 to add to the edge (i, j) can be computed in polynomial time.\nProof:\n\nNote that\nx\u2032i\n\n\u2212\n\nx\u2032j\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c1(vi,i \u2212 vi,j )\n= (xi \u2212 xj ) 1 \u2212\n1 + \u03c1(vi,i \u2212 vi,j )\nxi \u2212 xj\n=\n,\n1 + \u03c1(vi,i \u2212 vi,j )\n\n\u0013\n\nand we can write the new Nash equilibrium as x\u2032 = x \u2212 \u03c6vi , where\n\u03c6=\n\nx\u2032i \u2212 x\u2032j\n\u03c1(xi \u2212 xj )\n= \u03c1(xi \u2212 xj )\n= \u03c1(x\u2032i \u2212 x\u2032j ).\n1 + \u03c1(vi,i \u2212 vi,j )\nxi \u2212 xj\n\nFor small values of \u03c1, we have that \u03c6 = \u03c1(xi \u2212 xj ) + O(\u03c12 ); and as \u03c1 \u2192 \u221e, we have that \u03c6 \u2192\n\u03c6max = (xi \u2212 xj )/(vi,i \u2212 vi,j ) and x\u2032i \u2212 x\u2032j \u2192 0. Thus, adding a small amount of weight to edge (i, j)\nmoves the Nash equilibrium in the direction of the influence vector vi proportional to the weight\n\u03c1 and the discrepancy xi \u2212 xj ; while adding larger amounts of weight moves the Nash equilibrium\nby a bounded amount in the direction of the influence vector vi , with the asymptotic limit of large\nedge weight corresponding to the case when i and j have the same opinion.\nWhat does adding a weighted edge between i and j do to the social cost at Nash equilibrium?\nIn the modified graph, the social cost is\nc\u2032 (z) = z T Az + \u03c1(zi \u2212 zj )2 + kz \u2212 sk2 .\nAt the new Nash equilibrium, we have\nc\u2032 (x\u2032 ) = x\u2032T Ax\u2032 + \u03c1(x\u2032i \u2212 x\u2032j )2 + kx\u2032 \u2212 sk2\n= x\u2032T Ax\u2032 + \u03c6(x\u2032i \u2212 x\u2032j ) + kx\u2032 \u2212 sk2 .\n\nBecause x\u2032 is a linear function of \u03c6, the above shows that c\u2032 (x\u2032 ) is a quadratic function of \u03c6, which\nwe can simplify to c\u2032 (x\u2032 ) = \u03b1ij \u03c62 \u2212 2\u03b2ij \u03c6 + c(x), where\n\u03b1ij = viT (A + I)vi \u2212 (vi,i \u2212 vi,j )\n1\n\u03b2ij = viT ((A + I)x \u2212 s) \u2212 (xi \u2212 xj ).\n2\nThe range of possible values for \u03c6 is between 0 (corresponding to \u03c1 = 0) and \u03c6max (corresponding\nto the limit as \u03c1 goes to infinity). Subject to the constraints on the range of \u03c6, the quadratic in \u03c6\nis minimal either at 0, at \u03c6max , or at \u03b2ij /\u03b1ij (assuming this point is between 0 and \u03c6max ). We can\ntherefore determine the optimal weight for a single edge in polynomial time.\n\n19\n\n\f\u03b3ij\n\nNote that the above computations also give us a simple formula for the gradient components\ncorresponding to differentiation with respect to wij :\nd[c\u2032 (x\u2032 )] d\u03c6\nd[c\u2032 (x\u2032 )]\n=\n= \u22122\u03b2ij (xi \u2212 xj )\nd\u03c1\nd\u03c6 d\u03c1\n= (xi \u2212 xj )2 \u2212 2(xi \u2212 xj )viT ((A + I)x \u2212 s).\n\n\u03b3ij \u2261\n\nThe residual vector (A + I)x \u2212 s measures the extent to which x fails to satisfy the equation for\nthe socially optimal opinion y. If this vector is large enough, and if the influence vector vi is\nsufficiently well aligned with the residual, then adding weight to the (i, j) edge can decrease the\nsocial cost at Nash equilibrium. Thus, though computing a globally optimal choice of additional\nedge weights may be NP-hard, we can generally compute locally optimal edge additions via the\nmethod of steepest descent.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Michael Macy for valuable discussion.\n\nReferences\n[1] D.
