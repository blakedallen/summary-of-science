STERN\n\n1. Introduction\nIn the past few years there has been significant progress on the problem of finding\n2\nexotic smooth structures on the manifolds Pm = CP2 #m CP . The initial step\nwas taken by Jongil Park, [P], who found the first exotic smooth structure on P7 ,\nand whose ideas renewed the interest in this subject. Peter Ozsvath and Zoltan\nSzabo proved that Park's manifold is minimal [OS], and Andras Stipsicz and Szabo\nused a technique similar to Park's to construct an exotic structure on P6 [SS].\nShortly thereafter, the authors of this article developed a technique for producing\ninfinite families of smooth structures on Pm , 6 \u2264 m \u2264 8 [FS5], and Park, Stipsicz,\nand Szabo showed that this can be applied to the case m = 5 [PSS].\nIt is the goal of this paper to better understand the underlying mechanism which\nproduces infinitely many distinct smooth structures on Pm , 5 \u2264 m \u2264 8. As we\nexplain below, all these constructions start with the elliptic surface E(1) = P9 ,\nperform a knot surgery using a family of twist knots indexed by an integer n [FS4],\nthen blow the result up several times in order to find a suitable configuration of\nspheres that can be rationally blown down [FS2] to obtain a smooth structure\non Pm that is distinguished by the integer n. We shall explain how this can be\naccomplished by surgery on nullhomologous tori in a manifold Rm homeomorphic\nto Pm , 5 \u2264 m \u2264 8. In other words, we shall find a nullhomologous torus \u039bm\nin Rm so that 1/n-surgery on \u039bm preserves the homeomorphism type of Rm , but\nchanges the smooth structure of Rm in a way that depends on n. Presumably, Rm\nis diffeomorphic to Pm , but we have not yet been able to show this in general. Our\nhope is that by better understanding \u039bm and its properties, one will be able to find\nsimilar nullhomologous tori in Pm , for m < 5.\n2. A short history of simply connected 4-manifolds with b+ = 1\nIt is a basic question of 4-manifold topology to understand the smooth structures on the complex projective plane CP2 . Thus one is interested in knowing the\n2\nsmallest m for which Pm = CP2 #m CP admits an exotic smooth structure. The\nThe first author was partially supported NSF Grant DMS0305818 and the second author by\nNSF Grant DMS0505080.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nRONALD FINTUSHEL AND RONALD J. STERN\n\nfirst such example was produced by Simon Donaldson in the historic paper [D],\nwhere it was shown that the Dolgachev surface E(1)2,3 , the result of performing\nlog transforms of orders 2 and 3 on the rational elliptic surface E(1) = P9 [Dv], is\nhomeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to P9 . This breakthrough example provided\nthe first known instance of an exotic smooth structure on a simply connected 4manifold. Later, work of Friedman and Morgan [FM] showed that the integers p and\nq are smooth invariants. The fact that E(1)p,q is not diffeomorphic to E(1)p\u2032 ,q\u2032 for\n{p, q} 6= {p\u2032 , q \u2032 } persists even after an arbitrary number of blowups [FS1]; however,\nno minimal exotic smooth structures are currently known for Pm , m \u2265 10.\nIn the late 1980's, Dieter Kotschick [K] proved that the Barlow surface, known to\nbe homeomorphic to P8 , is not diffeomorphic to it. However, in following years the\nsubject of simply connected smooth 4-manifolds with b+ = 1 languished because of\na lack of suitable examples. As we mentioned above, largely due to the example of\nPark [P] of an exotic smooth structure on P7 , this topic has again become active.\nHere is an outline of a version of Park's example: Consider E(1) with an elliptic\nfibration whose singular fibers are four nodal fibers and and I8 -fiber. (An In -fiber is\ncomprised of a circular plumbing of n 2-spheres of self-intersection \u22122 [BPV].) This\nelliptic fibration has a section which is an exceptional curve E (of self-intersection\n\u22121). Blow up E(1) four times, at the double points of the four nodal fibers. Then\n2\nin E(1)#4CP \u223c\n= P13 , we find a configuration of 2-spheres consisting of E, four\ndisjoint spheres of self-intersection \u22124, each intersecting E once, and the I8 -fiber,\nwhich E intersects in exactly one 2-sphere, and the I8 -fiber is disjoint from the four\nspheres of self-intersection \u22124.\nThe transverse intersections of E with the four spheres of self-intersection \u22124\ncan be smoothed to obtain a 2-sphere of self-intersection \u22129. Together with spheres\nfrom the I8 -fiber, we obtain a linear configuration of 2-spheres:\n\u22129r \u22122r \u22122r \u22122r \u22122r \u22122r\nA regular neighborhood of this configuration has as its boundary the lens space\nL(49, \u22126), and as we explain below, this lens space bounds a rational homology ball.\nThis means that this configuration can be rationally blown down [FS2], reducing\nb\u2212 by 6. One obtains a manifold P with b+ = 1 and b\u2212 = 7. It is not difficult to\nshow that P is simply connected, and so it is homeomorphic to P7 . It follows from\nSeiberg-Witten theory that P is not diffeomorphic to P7 . This will be explained\nbelow. While this is not precisely the description of the manifold that was given\nin [P] (and it is not even clear that P is diffeomorphic to the example of [P]), the\nconstruction given here is similar to that of Park.\n\n\fSURGERY ON NULLHOMOLOGOUS TORI\n\n3\n\nStipsicz and Szabo improved on Park's example by finding a more complicated\nconfiguration in a larger blowup of E(1), yet one which could be rationally blown\ndown to get an even smaller manifold, homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to P6 .\nFor some time, even after these examples, it was suspected that Pm , m < 9 would\nsupport only finitely many distinct smooth structures. This was due to the fact\nthat until [FS5] the only technique available for producing infinitely many distinct\nsmooth structures on a given smooth 4-manifold X was to require that X contain\na minimal genus torus with trivial normal bundle and representing a nontrivial\nhomology class. It is known that Pm , m < 9, contain no such tori. Thus it is is the\ngoal of this paper to better understand techniques for producing infinitely many\ndistinct smooth structures and to better understand the examples of [FS5].\n3. Seiberg-Witten invariants, rational blowdowns, and knot surgery\n3.1. Seiberg-Witten invariants. Let X be a simply connected oriented 4-mani2\nfold with b+\nX = 1 with a given orientation of H+ (X; R) and a given metric g. The\nSeiberg-Witten invariant depends on the metric g and a self-dual 2-form as follows.\n2\nThere is a unique g-self-dual harmonic 2-form \u03c9g \u2208 H+\n(X; R) with \u03c9g2 = 1 and\ncorresponding to the positive orientation. (Often \u03c9g is called a period point for the\nmetric g.) Fix a characteristic homology class k \u2208 H2 (X; Z). Given a pair (A, \u03c8),\nwhere A is a connection in the complex line bundle whose first Chern class is the\ni\n[FA ] of k and \u03c8 a section of the bundle W + of self-dual spinors\nPoincar\u00e9 dual b\nk = 2\u03c0\nfor the associated spin c structure, the perturbed Seiberg-Witten equations are:\nDA \u03c8 = 0\n\nFA+ = q(\u03c8) + i\u03b7\nwhere FA+ is the self-dual part of the curvature FA , DA is the twisted Dirac operator,\n\u03b7 is a self-dual 2-form on X, and q is a quadratic function. Write SWX,g,\u03b7 (k) for\nthe corresponding invariant. As the pair (g, \u03b7) varies, SWX,g,\u03b7 (k) can change only\nat those pairs (g, \u03b7) for which there are solutions with \u03c8 = 0. These solutions occur\nfor pairs (g, \u03b7) satisfying (2\u03c0 b\nk + \u03b7) * \u03c9g = 0. This last equation defines a wall in\nH 2 (X; R).\n\nThe point \u03c9g determines a component of the double cone consisting of elements\nof H 2 (X; R) of positive square. We prefer to work with H2 (X; R). The dual\ncomponent is determined by the Poincar\u00e9 dual H of \u03c9g . An element H \u2032 \u2208 H2 (X; R)\nof positive square lies in the same component as H if H \u2032 *H > 0. If (2\u03c0 b\nk +\u03b7)*\u03c9g 6= 0\nfor a generic \u03b7, SWX,g,\u03b7 (k) is well-defined, and its value depends only on the sign of\n\u2212\nb\n(2\u03c0 b\nk + \u03b7) * \u03c9g . Write SW+\nX,H (k) for SWX,g,\u03b7 (k) if (2\u03c0 k + \u03b7) * \u03c9g > 0 and SWX,H (k)\nin the other case.\n\nb\nThe invariant SWX,H (k) is defined by SWX,H (k) = SW+\nX,H (k) if (2\u03c0 k) * \u03c9g > 0,\n\u2212\nor dually, if k * H > 0, and SWX,H (k) = SWX,H (k) if k * H < 0. The wall-crossing\n\n\f4\n\nRONALD FINTUSHEL AND RONALD J. STERN\n\nformula [KM, LL] states that if H \u2032 , H \u2032\u2032 are elements of positive square in H2 (X; R)\nwith H \u2032 * H > 0 and H \u2032\u2032 * H > 0, then if k * H \u2032 < 0 and k * H \u2032\u2032 > 0,\n1\n\nSWX,H \u2032\u2032 (k) \u2212 SWX,H \u2032 (k) = (\u22121)1+ 2 d(k)\nwhere d(k) = 41 (k 2 \u2212(3 sign+2 e)(X)) is the formal dimension of the Seiberg-Witten\nmoduli spaces.\nFurthermore, in case b\u2212 \u2264 9, the wall-crossing formula, together with the fact\nthat SWX,H (k) = 0 if d(k) < 0, implies that SWX,H (k) = SWX,H \u2032 (k) for any H \u2032 of\n\u2212\npositive square in H2 (X; R) with H * H \u2032 > 0. So in case b+\nX = 1 and bX \u2264 9, there\nis a well-defined Seiberg-Witten invariant, SWX (k). If SWX (k) 6= 0, k is called a\nbasic class of X.\nIt is convenient to view the Seiberg-Witten invariant as an element of the integral\ngroup ring ZH2 (X). For k \u2208 H2 (X) we let tk denote the corresponding element in\nZH2 (X). Then the Seiberg-Witten invariant of X is\nX\nSW X,H =\nSWX,H (k) * tk\nAn important property of the Seiberg-Witten invariant is that if X admits a\nmetric g of positive scalar curvature, then for the Poincar\u00e9 dual H of \u03c9g , we have\nSW X,H = 0. In particular, for m \u2264 9, SW Pm = 0.\n3.2. Rational blowdowns. Let Cp be the smooth 4-manifold obtained by plumbing (p \u2212 1) disk bundles over the 2-sphere according to the diagram\n\n\u2212(p + 2)\nr\nu0\n\n\u22122\nr\nu1\n\n* * ** ** * *\n\n\u22122\nr\nup\u22122\n\nThen the classes of the 0-sections have self-intersections u20 = \u2212(p+2) and u2i = \u22122,\ni = 1, . . . , p \u2212 2. The boundary of Cp is the lens space L(p2 , 1 \u2212 p) which bounds\na rational ball Bp with \u03c01 (Bp ) = Zp and \u03c01 (\u2202Bp ) \u2192 \u03c01 (Bp ) surjective. If Cp is\nembedded in a 4-manifold X then the rational blowdown manifold X(p) of [FS2] is\nobtained by replacing Cp with Bp , i.e., X(p) = (X rCp ) \u222a Bp . This construction is\nindependent of the choice of gluing map.\nRational Blowdown Theorem ([FS2]). Let X be a simply connected 4-manifold\ncontaining the configuration of 2-spheres, Cp . If X r Cp is also simply connected\nthen so is the rational blowdown manifold X(p) . The homology, H2 (X(p) ; R), may\nbe identified with the orthogonal complement of the classes ui , i = 0, . . . , p \u2212 2 in\nH2 (X; R).\nGiven a characteristic homology class k \u2208 H2 (X(p) ; Z), there is a lift e\nk \u2208\nH2 (X; Z) which is characteristic and for which the dimensions of moduli spaces\n+\ne\nk). If b+\nagree, dX(p) (k) = dX (e\nX > 1 then SWX(p) (k) = SWX (k). In case bX = 1, if\n\n\fSURGERY ON NULLHOMOLOGOUS TORI\n\n5\n\nH \u2208 H2+ (X; R) is orthogonal to all the ui then it also can be viewed as an element\nof H2+ (X(p) ; R), and SWX(p) ,H (k) = SWX,H (e\nk).\n\n3.3. Knot surgery. Let X be a 4-manifold which contains a homologically essential torus T of self-intersection 0, and let K be a knot in S 3 . Let N (K) be a tubular\nneighborhood of K in S 3 , and let T \u00d7 D2 be a tubular neighborhood of T in X.\nThen the knot surgery manifold XK is defined by\nXK = (X r(T \u00d7 D2 )) \u222a (S 1 \u00d7 (S 3 rN (K))\nThe two pieces are glued together in such a way that the homology class [pt \u00d7 \u2202D2 ]\nis identified with [pt \u00d7 \u03bb] where \u03bb is the class of a longitude of K. For example, if X\nis a simply connected elliptic surface with a (spherical) section S of self-intersection\nn and one performs knot surgery on the fiber T of this fibration, then the gluing\ncondition implies that in XK there is a pseudosection SK of genus equal to the genus\nof the knot K and with self-intersection n. By 'pseudosection' we mean that the\nintersection number SK * F = 1. However, XK need no longer be an elliptic surface.\nThis surface SK is constructed by removing a disk from S where it intersects the\nfiber T and replacing this disk by a Seifert surface for the knot K.\nOne can also interpret XK as a fiber sum. Let MK denote the 3-manifold\nobtained from 0-framed surgery on K in S 3 . Then\nXK = X#T =S 1 \u00d7m S 1 \u00d7 MK\nwhere m is a meridian of K.\nThe gluing condition does not, in general, completely determine the diffeomorphism type of XK ; however if we take XK to be any manifold constructed in this\nfashion and if, for example, T has a cusp neighborhood, then the Seiberg-Witten\ninvariant of XK is completely determined by the Seiberg-Witten invariant of X and\nthe symmetrized Alexander polynomial \u2206s of K:\nKnot Surgery Theorem ([FS4]). Let X be a 4-manifold which contains a homologically essential torus T of self-intersection 0 whose H1 is generated by vanishing\ncycles, and let K be a knot in S 3 . The Seiberg-Witten invariant of the knot surgery\nmanifold XK is given by\nSW XK = SW X * \u2206s (t2 )\nwhere t represents the homology class of the torus T . Furthermore, if X and XrT\nare simply connected, then so is XK .\n4. Double node neighborhoods and knot surgery\nA simply connected elliptic surface is fibered over S 2 with smooth fiber a torus\nand with singular fibers. The most generic type of singular fiber is a nodal fiber (an\nimmersed 2-sphere with one transverse positive double point). The monodromy of\n\n\f6\n\nRONALD FINTUSHEL AND RONALD J. STERN\n\na nodal fiber is Da , a Dehn twist around the 'vanishing cycle' a \u2208 H1 (F ; Z), where\nF is a smooth fiber of the elliptic fibration. The vanishing cycle a is represented\nby a nonseparating loop on the smooth fiber and the nodal fiber is obtained by\ncollapsing this vanishing cycle to a point to create a transverse self-intersection.\nThe vanishing cycle bounds a 'vanishing disk', a disk of relative self-intersection \u22121\nwith respect to the framing of its boundary given by pushing the loop off itself on\nthe smooth fiber.\nAn I2 -fiber consists of a pair of 2-spheres of self-intersection \u22122 which are\nplumbed at two points. The monodromy of an I2 -fiber is Da2 , which is also the\nmonodromy of a pair of nodal fibers with the same vanishing cycle. This means\nthat an elliptic fibration which contains an I2 -fiber can be perturbed to contain two\nnodal fibers with the same vanishing cycle.\nA double node neighborhood D is a fibered neighborhood of an elliptic fibration\nwhich contains exactly two nodal fibers with the same vanishing cycle. If F is a\nsmooth fiber of D, there is a vanishing class a that bounds vanishing disks in the\ntwo different nodal fibers, and these give rise to a sphere V of self-intersection \u22122\nin D.\nIn [FS5] we showed how performing knot surgery in a double node neighborhood\nD in E(1) can give rise to an immersed pseudosection of self-intersection \u22121. Let us\nreview a version of this construction. Consider the knot K of Figure 1. Of course,\nthis is just the unknot, and we see a Seifert surface \u03a3 of genus one. Let \u0393 be the\nloop which runs through both half-twists in the clasp. Then \u0393 satisfies the two key\nconditions of [FS5]:\n(i) \u0393 bounds a disk in S 3 which intersects K in exactly two points.\n(ii) The linking number in S 3 of \u0393 with its pushoff on \u03a3 is +1.\nIt follows from these properties that \u0393 bounds a punctured torus in S 3 rK.\n\nFigure 1: K = unknot\nIt is known that E(1) admits an elliptic fibration with two nodal fibers, an I2 fiber and an I8 -fiber [Pn]. As above, this fibration can be perturbed so that the\nI2 -fiber gives us a double node neighborhood D with vanishing cycle a. Consider\nthe result of knot surgery in D using the knot K and the fiber F of E(1). In the\n\n\fSURGERY ON NULLHOMOLOGOUS TORI\n\n7\n\nknot surgery construction, one is free to make any choice of gluing as long as a\nlongitude of K is sent to the boundary circle of a normal disk to F . We choose\nthe gluing so that the class of a meridian m of K is sent to the class of a \u00d7 {pt} in\nH1 (\u2202(DrN (F )); Z) = H1 (F \u00d7 \u2202D2 ; Z). Note that the result of knot surgery,\nE(1)K = E(1)rN (F ) \u222a S 1 \u00d7 (S 3 rN (K)) = E(1)rN (F ) \u222a T 2 \u00d7 D2\nbecause K is the unknot. Since any diffeomorphism of \u2202(E(1)rN (F )) extends over\nall of E(1)rN (F ), we see that E(1)K is diffeomorphic to E(1).\nThere is a genus one pseudosection SK in E(1)K which is formed using the\ngenus one Seifert surface \u03a3. The self-intersection of SK is \u22121. The loop \u0393 sits on\nSK and by (i) it bounds a twice-punctured disk \u2206 in {pt} \u00d7 \u2202(S 3 rN (K)) where\n\u2202\u2206 = \u0393 \u222a m1 \u222a m2 where the mi are meridians of K. The meridians mi bound\ndisjoint vanishing disks \u2206i in DrN (F ) since they are identified with disjoint loops\neach of which represents the class of a \u00d7 {pt} in H1 (\u2202(DrN (F )); Z). Hence in DK ,\nthe result of knot surgery on D, the loop \u0393 \u2282 SK bounds a disk U = \u2206 \u222a \u22061 \u222a \u22062 .\nBy construction, the relative self-intersection of U relative to the framing given\nby the pushoff of \u0393 in SK is +1 \u2212 1 \u2212 1 = \u22121. (This uses (ii).) Furthermore,\nU \u2229 SK = \u0393.\nSince \u0393 is nonseparating in SK , surgery on it kills \u03c01 (SK ). Ambient surgery\nmay be performed in DK by removing an annular neighborhood of \u0393 and replacing\nit with a pair of disks U \u2032 , U \u2032\u2032 as obtained above. These disks intersect in a single\npoint, and this is precisely the complex-algebraic model of a nodal intersection.\nThis means that we can represent the homology class of the pseudosection [SK ] in\nH2 (E(1)K ; Z) by an immersed sphere S \u2032 with one positive double point.\nWith these as preliminaries, our goal for the remainder of this paper is to construct for for every 5 \u2264 m \u2264 8 a manifold Rm that is homeomorphic to Pm , has\nvanishing Seiberg-Witten invariants, and contains a nullhomologous torus Tm with\nthe property that a 1/n-surgery on Tm (with respect to the nullhomologous framing) yields a smooth structure on Pm distinguished by the integer n. We conjecture\nthat Rm is diffeomorphic to Pm , but we are unable to show this at this time. We\nstart with the m = 8 case in the next section.\n\n2\n\n5. Infinite families homeomorphic to CP2 #8CP\n\nThe construction of the previous section shows that in E(1) \u223c\n= E(1)K one has\nthe configuration consisting of the immersed 2-sphere S \u2032 with a pair of disjoint\nnodal fibers, each intersecting S \u2032 once transversely. Also, S \u2032 intersects the I8 -fiber\ntransversely in one point. This is illustrated in Figure 2.\nAt this stage there are three possibilities:\n\n\f8\n\nRONALD FINTUSHEL AND RONALD J. STERN\n\n1. If we blow up the double point of S \u2032 , then in P10 we obtain a configuration\nconsisting of the total transform S \u2032\u2032 of S \u2032 , which is a sphere of self-intersection \u22125,\nand the sphere of self-intersection \u22122 at which S \u2032 intersects I8 . (see Figure 3.) This\nis the configuration C3 which can be rationally blown down to obtain a manifold\nR8 with b+ = 1 and b\u2212 = 8. It is easy to see that R8 is simply connected; so R8 is\nhomeomorphic to P8 .\n\nFigure 2\n\nFigure 3\n\n2. Blow up at the double point of S \u2032 as well as at the double point of one of the\nnodal fibers. Then in P11 we get a configuration of 2-spheres consisting of S \u2032\u2032 , a\ntransverse sphere F \u2032 of self-intersection \u22124, and three spheres from the I8 -fiber.\n(See Figure 4.) Smoothing the intersection of S \u2032\u2032 and F \u2032 gives a sphere of selfintersection \u22127 and we obtain the configuration C5 in P11 . Rationally blowing\ndown C5 gives a manifold R7 homeomorphic to P7 .\n\n\fSURGERY ON NULLHOMOLOGOUS TORI\n\n9\n\nFigure 4\n\n3. Blow up at the double point of S \u2032 as well as at the double points of both nodal\nfibers. Then in P12 we get a configuration of 2-spheres consisting of S \u2032\u2032 , two disjoint\ntransverse spheres F \u2032 , F \u2032\u2032 of self-intersection \u22124, and five spheres from the I8 -fiber.\n(See Figure 5.) Smoothing the intersections of S \u2032\u2032 , F \u2032 and F \u2032\u2032 gives a sphere of\nself-intersection \u22129 and we obtain the configuration C7 in P12 . Rationally blowing\ndown C7 gives a manifold R6 homeomorphic to P6 .\n\nFigure 5\nWe shall work with the the first case, and then indicate what needs to be done\nto take care of the other cases. In Case 1, we obtain a manifold R = R8 which is\nhomeomorphic to P8 . We conjecture that R is actually diffeomorphic to P8 , but for\nnow it will suffice to see that it shares with P8 the property that its Seiberg-Witten\ninvariant vanishes. This will follow once we show that R contains a sphere H of selfintersection 1 (cf. [FS3]). This sphere is obtained from the sphere H representing\n2\na generator of H2 (CP2 ; Z) contained in CP2 #9CP = P9 = E(1), because the\nconstruction of R starts with E(1), blows up and rationally blows down, and all\nthe surfaces involved are disjoint from H. Hence:\nProposition 5.1. SW R = 0.\n\n\f10\n\nRONALD FINTUSHEL AND RONALD J. STERN\n\nBack in E(1) = E(1)K = E(1)#F =S 1 \u00d7m S 1 \u00d7 MK there is a nullhomologous\ntorus \u039b = S 1 \u00d7 \u03bb where \u03bb is the loop shown in Figure 6, which is a Kirby calculus\ndepiction of MK = S 1 \u00d7 S 2 , since K is the unknot.\nSince \u039b as well as the 3-manifold that it bounds (S 1 \u00d7 punctured torus) are disjoint\nfrom the regions where our constructions were made, \u039b descends to a nullhomologous torus (which we still call \u039b) in R. Let Q be the result of 0-surgery on \u039b \u2282 R,\nwhere the '0-framing' is taken from the 0-framing on \u03bb in Figure 6. After this\nsurgery, the loop \u03bc which bounds a normal disk to \u039b, does not bound in Q. In\nfact, H2 (Q) is the direct sum of H2 (R) with a hyperbolic pair generated by \u039b0 , the\ntorus in Q corresponding to \u039b, and a dual class represented by a torus built from\nthe punctured torus that the longitude to \u03bb (the surgery curve) bounds and the\ndisk that the surgery curve bounds in Q. Thus b+ (Q) = 2.\n\nFigure 6\nTheorem 5.2. The Seiberg-Witten invariant of Q is: SW Q = t\u22121 \u2212 t, where\nt = tS 1 \u00d7m \u2208 ZH2 (Q).\nProof. The manifold Q is obtained by:\n1. Double node surgery with K = the unknot, blowing up, then rationally\nblowing down.\n2. 0-surgery on \u039b.\nSince \u039b is disjoint from all the constructions in (1), the order in which (1) and (2)\nare performed is irrelevant. (As an aside, note that if we could exactly \"see\" \u039b\nembedded in P8 , step (1) would be unnecessary, and we could then use P8 rather\nthan R.)\nIn E(1)K \u223c\n= E(1), do surgery on \u039b first. Recall that E(1)K is a fiber sum\nE(1)K = E(1)#F =S 1 \u00d7m S 1 \u00d7 MK\nand MK is the manifold given in Figure 6. The result of 0-surgery on \u039b in E(1)K\nis the fiber sum\nE(1)K,0 = E(1)#F =S 1 \u00d7m S 1 \u00d7 Y\nwhere Y is the 3-manifold obtained from 0-surgery on \u03bb in Figure 6.\n\n\fSURGERY ON NULLHOMOLOGOUS TORI\n\n11\n\nWe shall now need the sewn-up link exterior construction of Brakes and Hoste.\nWe recall what this means. Let L be a link in S 3 with two oriented components\nL1 and L2 . Fix tubular neighborhoods Ni \u223c\n= S 1 \u00d7 D2 of Li with S 1 \u00d7 (pt on \u2202D2 )\na longitude of Li , i.e. nullhomologous in S 3 \\ Li . For any A \u2208 GL(2; Z) with\ndet A = \u22121, we the get a 3-manifold\ns(L; A) = (S 3 \\ int(N1 \u222a N2 ))/A\ncalled a sewn-up link exterior by identifying \u2202N1 with \u2202N2 via a diffeomorphism\n\u0001\n\u22121 0\ninducing A in homology. For n \u2208 Z, let An = \u2212n\n1 . A simple calculation shows\nthat H1 (s(L; An ); Z) = Z \u2295 Zn\u22122l where l is the linking number in S 3 of the two\ncomponents L1 , L2 , of L. The second summand is generated by the meridian to\neither component.\nWe now refer to the proof of the Knot Surgery Theorem given in [FS4]. A key\nstep in the proof, (see Figure 6 of [FS4]) which uses the work of Hoste [H], shows\nthat E(1)K,0 is diffeomorphic to\nE(1)L = E(1)#F =S 1 \u00d7m S 1 \u00d7 s(L, A\u22122 )\nwhere L = L1 \u222aL2 is the link of Figure 7, i.e. L is the Hopf link. The orientations on\nL1 and L2 are inherited from fixing an orientation on the knot K, e.g. in Figure 6.\nNote that since the linking number of L1 and L2 is \u22121, we have H1 (s(L; A\u22122 ); Z) =\nZ \u2295 Z.\n\nFigure 7\nIn s(L, A\u22122 ) we see an embedded torus transverse to the meridian m obtained by\nsewing up a Seifert surface for L, and we also see a loop \u0393 which satisfies conditions\n(i) and (ii) for double node surgery.\nThe proof of the Knot Surgery Theorem shows that the Seiberg-Witten invariant\nof E(1)L can be calculated via skein moves (macarena). Note that we are now\ncalculating the Seiberg-Witten invariant of a manifold with b+ = 2. This calculation\nis shown in Figure 8.

In E(1)L there is a genus one\npseudosection to which we can apply the double node construction. This pseudosection is the connected sum of a section in E(1) with the torus in {point}\u00d7s(L, A\u22122 )\nobtained by sewing up the shaded region in Figure 9. The necessary loop \u0393 is shown\nin Figure 7.\n\nFigure 9\nThe result of the double node construction is an immersed genus 0 pseudosection\nwith one positive double point. Blow up at this double point to get an embedded 22\nsphere C of self-intersection \u22125 in E(1)L #CP . The blowup formula [FS3] implies\nthat SW E(1)L #CP2 = (t\u22121 \u2212 t)(e + e\u22121 ) where e is is the class in the group ring\n2\n\ncorresponding to the exceptional curve. Hence the basic classes of E(1)L #CP are\n\u00b1F \u00b1 E. Now \u00b1(F + E) * C = \u00b13 whereas \u00b1(F \u2212 E) * C = \u22131. It follows from\n\n\fSURGERY ON NULLHOMOLOGOUS TORI\n\n13\n\nthe Rational Blowdown Theorem that only the basic classes \u00b1(F + E) descend to\nthe rational blowdown, Q.

There are infinitely many nonpairwise diffeomorphic 4-manifolds\n2\nhomeomorphic to P8 = CP2 #8CP obtained from 1/n-surgery on the nullhomologous torus \u039b in R.\nProof. For n \u2265 2 let Xn be the 4-manifold obtained from 1/n-surgery on \u039b in R.\nBy this we mean S 1 times 1/n-surgery on \u03bb in Figure 6. It is easy to see that Xn\nis simply connected and that there is an isomorphism \u03c6 : H2 (Xn ; Z) \u2192 H2 (R; Z),\nwhich is realized outside of a neighborhood of the surgery by the identity map.\nThus Xn is homeomorphic to P8 .\nMorgan, Mrowka, and Szabo have calculated the effect of such a surgery on\nSeiberg-Witten invariants [MMS]. Given a class k \u2208 H2 (Xn ):\nX\nSWQ (k \u2032\u2032 + i[\u039b0 ])\nSWXn (k) = SWR (\u03c6(k \u2032 )) + n\ni\n\n(Recall that the torus \u039b is nullhomologous in R and the corresponding torus \u039bn ,\nthe core of the surgery, is nullhomologous in Xn .)

This means that the small perturbation chambers for k\nin Xn and for \u03c6(k) in R correspond under \u03c6. According to the previous theorem,\nthere are only two classes, \u00b1T , T = [S 1 \u00d7 m] in Q with nontrivial Seiberg-Witten\ninvariants, and SW Q (\u00b1T ) = \u22131.\nThus we have\nSW Xn = SW R + SW Q = 0 + n (t\u22121 \u2212 t)\nThis shows that the manifolds Xn are pairwise nondiffeomorphic. That they are\nall minimal follows from the blowup formula.\n\u0003\n\n\f14\n\nRONALD FINTUSHEL AND RONALD J. STERN\n\n6. Infinite families with b\u2212 = 5, 6, 7\nFor b\u2212 = 6, 7, the constructions and calculations that there is a nullhomologous\ntorus \u039b in R = R6 or R7 such that 1/n-surgery on \u039b in R produces infinitely\nmany distinct smooth structures on P6 or P7 are completely analogous to those in\nthe last section. What differs is the proof that the Seiberg-Witten invariants of\nR = R6 or R7 vanish. We shall accomplish this by using an argument adapted\nfrom [OS]. This has in common with the previous argument its dependence on the\nadjunction inequality. The important point in the argument is that we are starting\nour construction with E(1)K = E(1); so all the exceptional curves are represented\nby spheres, etc. First consider the b\u2212 = 7 case. The classes\nV1 = H \u2212 E1 \u2212 E2 \u2212 E3 ,\n\nV2 = H \u2212 E2 \u2212 E3 \u2212 E4\n\nV3 = H \u2212 E3 \u2212 E4 \u2212 E5 ,\n\nV4 = H \u2212 E6 \u2212 E7 \u2212 E8 \u2212 E9\n\nV5 = F \u2212 E5 ,\nV7 = E10 \u2212 E1 \u2212 E2 ,\n\nV6 = E11 \u2212 E1 \u2212 E2\nV8 = 2H \u2212 3E11\n\nare all orthogonal to the configuration C5 and generate H2 (P11 rC5 ; Z) = H2 (R7 r\nB5 ; Z). In P11 , the classes V1 , V2 , V3 are represented by embedded spheres of selfintersection \u22122, V4 , V6 , V7 are represented by embedded spheres of self-intersection\n\u22123, V5 is represented by an embedded torus of self-intersection \u22123, and V8 is\nrepresented by an embedded torus with square \u22125. According to the argument of\n[OS], any basic class k of R7 must satisfy the adjunction inequality\nVi2 + |k * Vi | \u2264 0, i = 1, . . . , 8\nFurthermore, k must satisfy,\nk 2 \u2265 2,\n\nk2 \u2261 2\n\n(mod 8)\n\nThese follow from the fact that for any basic class, its corresponding moduli space\nmust have nonnegative even dimension.\nSince H 2 (R7 , Z) injects into H 2 (R7 rB5 ; Z), any Seiberg-Witten basic class of\nR7 is uniquely determined by its intersection numbers with V1 , . . . , V8 . There is\nnow a finite check for possible basic classes k of R7 which must satisfy these three\nprevious conditions. This check turns up 40 classes in H 2 (R7 r B5 ; Z). Another\nclass in H2 (P11 ; Z) which is orthogonal to C5 is V9 = 2H \u2212 3E10 . It is represented\nby an embedded torus of self-intersection \u22125. Any basic class of R7 must also\nsatisfy the adjunction inequality with respect to V9 . This condition reduces the\nnumber of possible classes to 14. According to the Rational Blowdown Theorem\nthe Seiberg-Witten invariant of any such class is determined by the Seiberg-Witten\ninvariant of an appropriate lift to P11 . Such a lift determines a Seiberg-Witten\nmoduli space for P11 whose formal dimension is the same as that of the moduli\nspace for R7 corresponding to the class being lifted. This is accomplished via an\nextension across C5 for each of the 14 possibilities.\n\n\fSURGERY ON NULLHOMOLOGOUS TORI\n\n15\n\nThe class \u0124 = V1 + V2 + V3 + V8 is orthogonal to C5 and \u0124 2 = 4 > 0, \u0124 * H =\n6 > 0. Hence \u0124 serves as a period point for R7 . Since SW P11 ,H = 0, for any\ncharacteristic cohomology class k of P11 ,\n(\n0\nif the signs of k * \u0124 and k * H agree\nSW P11 ,\u0124 (k) =\n\u00b11 if the signs of k * \u0124 and k * H do not agree\nUsing this criterion on each of the 14 possibilities mentioned above shows that each\nhas Seiberg-Witten invariant equal to 0. Thus we have SW R7 = 0.\nThe b\u2212 = 6 case follows similarly, but the calculation turns out to be easier. The\nclasses\nV1 = E12 \u2212 E1 , V2 = E11 \u2212 E1 V3 = E10 \u2212 E1 , V4 = E3 \u2212 E1 ,\nV5 = E2 \u2212 E1 , V6 = H \u2212 3E1 , V7 = 2F + H \u2212 E3 \u2212 E10 \u2212 E11 \u2212 E12\ngenerate H2 (P12 r C7 ; Z) = H2 (R6 r B7 ; Z). In P12 , the classes V1 , . . . , V5 are all\nrepresented by embedded spheres of self-intersection \u22122, V6 is represented by an\nembedded torus of self-intersection \u22128, and V7 is represented by an embedded\nsurface of genus 4 with square 5. If k is a basic class of X, then b it must satisfy\nthe adjunction inequality with respect to the classes V1 , . . . , V7 ; i.e.\nVi2 + |k * Vi | \u2264 0, i = 1, . . . , 6; V72 + |k * Vi | \u2264 2g \u2212 2 = 6\nand as above, k must also satisfy\nk 2 \u2265 3,\n\nk2 \u2261 3\n\n(mod 8)\n\nThis time a check turns up no classes in H 2 (R6 rB7 ; Z) which satisfy these conditions. Hence SW R6 = 0.\nTo obtain families of manifolds homeomorphic to P5 , we start with an elliptic\nfibration on E(1) with two nodal fibers, two I2 -fibers and an I6 -fiber. (Again, see\n[Pn].) This time we have two double node neighborhoods. One goes through the\nsame construction in each of these to obtain an immersed pseudosection with two\n2\ndouble points. Blowing up each, we obtain a sphere of square \u22129 in E(1)#2CP ,\nand adding on five of the spheres of the I6 -singularity, gives a copy of the configuration C7 , which can be rationally blown down to obtain a manifold R5 homeomorphic\nto P5 . This process can be carried out so the the +1-sphere H descends to R5 ;\nso we see that SW R5 = 0. Furthermore, we get the nullhomologous tori \u039b1 , \u039b2 ,\nas before; one in each neighborhood. Performing 0-surgery on each gives a man\u22121\nifold Q with b+ = 3 and SW = (t\u22121\n1 \u2212 t1 )(t2 \u2212 t2 ). Perform +1-surgery on \u039b2\nand 1/n-surgery on \u039b1 to obtain Yn which is homeomorphic to P5 , but which has\n\u22121\nSW Yn = n(t\u22121\n1 \u2212 t1 )(t2 \u2212 t2 ).\nReferences\n[BPV] W.
