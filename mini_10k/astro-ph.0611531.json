In particular, we have studied the dependence on the bubble size and position, the recurrence times of the bubbles, the\nway these bubbles are inflated and the underlying cluster profile. We find that in hydrostatic cluster models, the resulting metal distribution is very elongated along the\ndirection of the bubbles. Anisotropies in the cluster or ambient motions are needed if\nthe metal distribution is to be spherical. In order to parametrise the metal transport\nby bubbles, we compute effective diffusion coefficients. The diffusion coefficients inferred from our simple experiments lie at values of around \u223c 1029 cm2 s\u22121 at a radius\nof 10 kpc. The runs modelled on the Perseus cluster yield diffusion coefficients that\nagree very well with those inferred from observations.\nKey words:\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe hot, diffuse gas that permeates clusters of galaxies, the\nintra-cluster medium (ICM), has a metallicity of about 1/3\nof the solar value. Meanwhile, the total amount of iron in the\nICM is huge: it is larger than the total iron mass in all cluster\ngalaxies. Moreover, this value does not seem to vary much\nwith time, at least not up to a redshift of \u223c 1 (Tozzi et al.\n2003). The recent generation of X-ray observatories has provided maps of the radial distribution of metals in the nearby\nclusters (De Grandi & Molendi 2001; Fukazawa et al. 2000;\nSchmidt et al. 2002; Matsushita et al. 2002; Churazov et al.\n2003; De Grandi et al. 2004; Tamura et al. 2004). These observations have revealed an interesting trend:\nGalaxy clusters can be grouped into two categories depending on their X-ray surface brightness profiles: (i) clusters with a central peak in the X-ray surface brightness,\ni.e. clusters with a cool core and (ii) clusters without a\ncool core. Interestingly, these two groups show a different\nspatial distribution of metals. The clusters without cool\ncores have a nearly uniform spatial distribution of metals, while clusters with cool cores have a strongly peaked\nabundance profile. Moreover, the relative abundance of elements in cool core clusters suggests that Type Ia supernovae have provided most of the metals in the central iron\npeak. Finoguenov et al. (2002) have found that the central abundance peak is strongly enriched in iron while the\n\nbulk of the ICM outside the central region had an iron-tosilicon ratio close to the yields of Type II supernovae (also\nMushotzky et al. 1996). This suggests that the central metal\npeak is mostly caused by Type Ia supernovae in the central\ncluster galaxy. However, in order to produce the large mass\nof metals in the central peak, long enrichment times are necessary.\nThere are a number of observations that indicate that\nstars in massive galaxies are responsible for the metal\nenrichment of the ICM. It has been established that the\niron mass of the ICM correlates with the optical light of\nmassive early-type galaxies in clusters (Arnaud et al. 1992)\nand that the ratio of the iron mass to light and to the\ntotal mass is approximately constant. Thus, stellar mass\nloss from the central cluster galaxy through supernovae\nand stellar winds appears to be the prime source for the\nmetals observed in the inner parts of galaxy clusters.\nHowever, the observed metallicity profiles are much broader\nthan the stellar light profiles of the central galaxy. Hence,\nthe differences in the light and metal distributions are\ninterpreted as the result of transport processes that have\nmixed the metals into the ICM. Rebusco et al. (2005)\nhave assumed that the spreading is due to local turbulent\nmotions in the ICM, and that the evolution of the metal\ndensity profile can be modelled as a diffusion process.\nUsing the abundance profile from Churazov et al. (2003) for\nPerseus, Rebusco et al. (2005) estimated that a diffusion\n\n\f2\n\nE. Roediger et al.\n\ncoefficient of the order of 2 \u00d7 1029 cm2 s\u22121 is needed to\nexplain the width of the observed abundance profiles.\nBased on a model of iron enrichment from stellar mass\nloss in the central cluster galaxies of a few nearby clusters,\nB\u00f6hringer et al. (2004) have used the total amount of iron\nobserved in the ICM to obtain constraints on the age of the\ncooling cores (i.e. the time for which the central region have\nremained relatively undisturbed). They find very large ages\nof more than 7 Gyr (B\u00f6hringer et al. 2004) that provide\nnew constraints for the modelling of the interaction regions\nand have consequences for the turbulent transport of\nmetals. While it appears to be established that the metals\nproduced by the central galaxy are dispersed into the ICM\nto form the broad abundance peaks, it remains unclear\nwhat the mechanism is via which the metals are transported.\nCurrently, the most popular model that is invoked\nto explain the apparent stability of cool cores against a\ncooling catastrophe relies on heating by a central Active\nGalactic Nucleus (AGN). Radio-loud AGN are also thought\nto regulate the formation of the most massive galaxies and\nthus explain the cut-off of the galaxy luminosity function\nat the bright end (Croton et al. 2006). Radio-loud active\ngalactic nuclei drive strong outflows in the form of jets\nthat inflate bubbles or lobes. The lobes are filled with\nhot plasma, and can heat the cluster gas in a number\nof ways (e.g. Br\u00fcggen et al. 2002; Br\u00fcggen & Kaiser\n2002;\nChurazov et al.\n2001;\nDalla Vecchia et al.\n2004; Omma et al. 2004; Basson & Alexander 2003;\nReynolds et al. 2002; Ruszkowski et al. 2004; Br\u00fcggen et al.\n2005; Brighenti & Mathews 2006).\nIn fact, radio sources in cooling clusters are different\nfrom the general population of radio sources in galaxy\nclusters. Most radio galaxies in clusters are FR I sources in\nterms of their radio power, but they show a great variety\nof morphologies and dynamics (Owen & Ledlow 1997). The\ncentral galaxy in almost every strong cooling core contains\nan active nucleus and a currently active, jet\u2013driven radio\ngalaxy. High-resolution X-ray observations of cooling flow\nclusters with Chandra have revealed a multitude of X-ray\nholes on scales < 50 kpc, often coincident with patches of\nradio emission. In a recent compilation, B\u0131\u0302rzan et al. (2004)\nlists 18 well documented clusters which show X-ray cavities\nwith radio emission.\nBuoyantly rising bubbles induce subsonic motions\nin the cluster gas that can redistribute metals in the\nICM (Br\u00fcggen 2002). Considering the impact of resonant\nscatterings on the surface brightness profile of the most\nprominent X-ray emission lines, evidence for gas motions\nwas found in the XMM-Newton data on the Perseus cluster\n(Churazov et al. 2004). The same motions could spread the\nmetals over the cluster volume although the efficiency of\nspreading could be very sensitive to the character of these\nmotions. Other enrichment mechanisms include supernovaedriven winds, radiation-pressure-driven dust efflux (see e.g.\nAguirre et al. 2001) and ram pressure stripping of cluster\ngalaxies (Roediger & Brueggen 2005; Roediger et al. 2006).\nUsing cosmological simulations and a heuristic prescription\nfor the effect of ram-pressure stripping, Domainko et al.\n(2006) find that ram-pressure stripping can account for\n\n\u223c10% of the overall observed level of enrichment in the ICM\nwithin a radius of 1.3 Mpc (see also Tornatore et al. 2004).\nFurthermore, Schindler et al. (2005) find that ram-pressure\nstripping is more efficient than quiet (i.e. non-starburst\ndriven) galactic winds, at least in recent epochs since\nredshift 1. Also, they find that the expelled metals are not\nmixed immediately with the ICM, but inhomogeneities are\nvisible in the metallicity maps. Relatively little theoretical\nwork has gone in establishing the importance of AGNinduced transport of metals in cluster centres (Br\u00fcggen\n2002, Omma et al. 2004). However, this mode is likely to be\nvery important, at least at redshifts 6 1: If AGN-induced\nmotions are sufficient to quench cooling flows at the centres\nof galaxy clusters, they are similarly likely to affect the\nmetal distribution in the central cluster region. Simulations\nas those presented here are essential for a proper modelling\nof the chemical evolution of clusters via semi-analytical\ntechniques, as for example in De Lucia et al. (2004); Cora\n(2006).\nThe broad abundance peaks in clusters have been\nproduced over a time span of several gigayears. If the peaks\nhave been broadened by AGN, this process has taken a\nlarge number of activity cycles. In order to simulate the\ntransport of metals by AGN-induced flows and to capture\nthe hydrodynamical details important for the interaction\nbetween the AGN and the ICM, a fair resolution of the\ncomputational mesh is necessary. This prevents us from\nsimulating the bubble transport over cosmological times.\nHowever, we can still study the efficiency of the metal\ntransport by simulating a small number of AGN cycles\nand parametrise the transport efficiency. A convenient\nparametrisation that has been applied previously to observations (Rebusco et al. 2005) is based on a diffusion\ndescription. Even though we do not propose that the\nmetal transport occurs via microscopic diffusion, transport\nprocesses like these may be described by a diffusion parameter. This allows a direct comparison to observations\nwithout having to simulate the entire life time of the cluster.\nIn this paper, we investigate the influence of buoyantly\nrising bubbles in clusters on the metal distribution in the\nICM. In particular, we focus on the following questions:\n\n\u2022 How far out can bubbles carry metals?\n\u2022 How efficient is transport by buoyant bubbles?\n\u2022 Does this process cause characteristic features, e.g.\nanisotropies?\n\u2022 How does the resulting metal distribution depend on\nbubble and cluster parameters?\n\u2022 What effective diffusion coefficients does this form of\ntransport yield?\n\u2022 How do these coefficients compare with those found by\nRebusco et al. (2005)?\n\nTo this end, we simulated the effect of bubble-induced\nmotions in the ICM based on the 3D hydrodynamics code\nFLASH.\n\n\fMetal mixing by buoyant bubbles in galaxy clusters\n2\n2.1\n\nMETHOD\n\n2.2\n\nTable 1. ICM parameters for generic runs.\n\nOverview\n\nWe model the hydrodynamical evolution of the ICM in a\ngalaxy cluster. Initially, the ICM is set in hydrostatic equilibrium in a static cluster potential. Details of the ICM model\nare given in Sect. 2.3.1.\nWe assume that a central cluster galaxy injects metals\ninto the ICM with a rate proportional to its light distribution. Details of the central galaxy are given in Sect. 2.3.2.\nWe now trace the distribution of the metals by injecting a\ntracer fluid into the ICM at a rate that is proportional to the\nlight distribution of the central galaxy. Section 2.4 explains\nthe details of the metal injection and the way the metals are\ntraced throughout the simulation.\nFinally, we model the AGN activity by inflating ambipolar pairs of underdense bubbles in the ICM that rise\nbuoyantly and thus stir the ICM. In Section 2.5 we explain\nin detail how the bubbles are generated.\n\nCode\n\nThe simulations were performed with the FLASH code\n(Fryxell et al. 2000), a multidimensional adaptive mesh\nrefinement code. FLASH is a modular block-structured\nAMR code, parallelised using the Message Passing\nInterface (MPI) library. It solves the Riemann problem on a Cartesian grid using the Piecewise-Parabolic\nMethod (PPM). The simulations are performed in 3D\nand all boundaries are reflecting. We use a simulation\nbox of size (xmin , xmax ) \u00d7 (ymin , ymax ) \u00d7 (zmin , zmax ) =\n(\u2212145 kpc, 145 kpc)3 . The cluster centre is located at\n(xcluster , ycluster , zcluster ) = (0, 0, 0). For our grid, we chose\na block size of 163 zones. The unrefined root grid contains\n63 blocks. The refinement criteria are the standard density\nand pressure criteria. In the central \u223c 30 kpc, the grid\nis assigned a minimum refinement level of 3. Outside\n\u223c 100 kpc, the refinement is restricted to a maximum of\n5 levels to limit the computational effort. The resulting\nresolutions for the different runs are summarised in Table 3.\nThere have been some suggestions that the ICM\nmay have a non-negligible viscosity (Reynolds et al. 2005;\nRuszkowski et al. 2004). However, the effective viscosity of\nthe ICM remains unknown because the physics of such dilute\nand magnetised plasmas is poorly constrained. In particular,\nthe effect of magnetic fields on the macroscopic viscosity is\nunclear. Even minute magnetic fields lead to small proton\ngyroradii and are thus expected to suppress the viscosity\nefficiently. However, it has been pointed out that the exponential divergence of neigbouring field lines in a tangled\nmagnetic field may lead to only a very modest suppression\nof the viscosity. Reynolds et al. (2005) have simulated the\nbuoyant rise of bubbles in a medium with a kinematic viscosity. They found that even a modest shear viscosity (corresponding to 1/4 of the Spitzer value) can quench fluid instabilities and keep the bubbles intact (especially see figure\n4 in their paper). Other simulations of buoyant bubbles in\na viscous ICM were performed by Sijacki & Springel (2006)\nusing smoothed particle hydrodynamics.\nFLASH solves the equations of inviscid hydrodynamics.\n\n3\n\nRICM\n\u03c1ICM0\n\u03b2\nTICM\n\n50 kpc\n10\u221226 g cm\u22123\n0.5\n4.7 * 107 K\n\nThe Piecewise-Parabolic Method uses a monotonicity constraint rather than artificial viscosity to control oscillations\nnear discontinuities. However, the discretisation of the\nequations still leads to a numerical viscosity. A comparison\nwith the simulations of bubbles in a viscous medium by\nReynolds et al. (2005) (cf. with their figure 4) shows that\nthe Reynolds number in our simulations is > 1000.\nExcept by the effect of viscosity, bubbles can be stabilised by magnetic fields. It has been known for some time\nthat the hot gas in clusters of galaxies hosts significant magnetic fields (Carilli & Taylor 2002), with estimated typical\nmagnetic field strengths of 5 \u00d7 10\u22126 G (5 \u03bcG). A magnetic field tangential to the fluid interface can stabilise the\nRayleigh-Taylor instability (Chandrasekhar 1961), provided\nthe restoring tension generated by bending of the field lines\nexceeds the buoyancy force driving the instability. The stabilising effect of intracluster magnetic fields was pointed\nout by De Young (2003), who derived analytic conditions\nfor the stabilisation of relic radio bubbles in the hot ICM.\nThese calculations showed that the field strengths observed\nin many clusters will stabilise the bubble interface in the\nlinear regime, and hence the cluster magnetic fields could\naccount for why the relic radio bubbles are seen as intact objects at such late times. Additional support for this\nidea is found in the two-dimensional MHD calculations of\nBr\u00fcggen & Kaiser (2001), who applied a \u03b2 \u223c 10 field inside\nthe bubbles that was aligned with the bubble surface. While\nviscosity and magnetic fields can affect the dynamics of the\nbubbles and thus also the resultant transport of metals, the\neffects are still poorly understood. Here we only study the\ncase of inviscid and unmagnetised fluids.\n\n2.3\n2.3.1\n\nModel cluster\nICM distribution\n\nIn this paper, we study two different cluster models. In the\nfirst, generic one, we take a constant ICM temperature and\nthe pressure is set by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium.

(2005) have used a time-dependent metal injection rate that accounts for the higher supernova rate in\nthe past and the evolution of the stellar population (also\nseeRenzini et al. 1993). However, we follow the evolution of\nthe cluster for only about 1 Gyr. For typical cases studied\nin Rebusco et al. (2005), the metal injection rate does not\nchange significantly over this time. Hence in our simulations\nwe use a temporally constant metal injection rate. Table 2\nlists the parameters for the metal injection.\n2.4\n\nTracing the metals\n\nThe FLASH code offers the opportunity to advect mass\nscalars along with the gas density. In order to be able to trace\nthe metal distribution, we utilise one of the mass scalars, f ,\nto represent the local metal fraction in each cell:\n\u03c1metal\nf=\n(5)\n\u03c1\nHence, the quantity f \u03c1 gives the local metal density, \u03c1metal .\nThe metal density obeys the continuity equation including\nthe metal source:\n\u2202\n(f \u03c1) = \u2212\u2207 * (f \u03c1 ~v ) + \u03c1\u0307metal .\n(6)\n\u2202t\nIn order to model the metal injection by the central galaxy,\nwe assume that the metal fraction is small at all times.\nHence, we can neglect \u03c1\u0307metal as a source term in the continuity equation for the gas density, \u03c1. As a consequence, the\nsystem of hydrodynamical equations including Eq. 6 is identical for the set of variables (\u03c1\u0307metal , f ) and (A * \u03c1\u0307metal , A * f ),\nwhere A is a constant.

In this\nsimple picture, the jets inject energy into small volumina\nof the ICM at their terminal points. Thus, this region is\nin overpressure and expands until it reaches pressure equilibrium with the surrounding ICM. The result is a pair of\nunderdense, hot bubbles.\nIn our simulations, we generate pairs of bubbles on opposite sides of the cluster centre. There are various ways in\nwhich one could produce these bubbles and we have tested\nthe following two methods:\n\u2022 In the first method, we inflate the bubbles by injecting\nenergy into two small spheres of radius rinj with a constant\nrate \u0117 (in erg cm\u22123 s) over an interval of length \u03c4inj . The\n3\ntotal injected energy is Einj = \u01174\u03c0rinj\n\u03c4inj per bubble. The\ngas inside these spheres is heated and expands similar to\na Sedov explosion in a few Myr to form a pair of bubbles.\nThe parameters rinj , Einj and \u03c4inj are chosen such that the\nresulting bubbles show approximately a density contrast of\n\u03c1b /\u03c1amb = 0.03 to the surrounding ICM and approximately\na radius of rbbl . The expansion is much shorter than the rise\nof the generated bubbles. In addition to the bubbles, the\nexplosion sets off shock waves that move through the ICM.\nIncidentally, the dependence of the bubble dynamics on the\ndensity contrast, \u03c1b /\u03c1amb , is weak provided that \u03c1b /\u03c1amb \u226a\n1.\n\u2022 In the second method, we evacuate the bubble regions\nby removing gas while keeping them in pressure equilibrium\nwith their surroundings. This evacuation method does not\nproduce the shock waves generated by the inflation method.\nWe implement gas mass sinks inside two spheres of radius\nrbbl . Inside these regions, gas is removed with a certain rate\n\u03c1\u0307 over a time \u03c4evac . The evacuation is not done instantaneously to prevent numerical problems. However, \u03c4evac is\nsmall compared to the evolution timescale of the bubbles.\nThe sink rate \u03c1\u0307 is set to decrease the the density inside\nthe bubbles down to a density contrast of \u03c1b /\u03c1amb compared to the surrounding ICM. In order to conserve the\nmetal mass, the metal fraction also needs to be updated during the evacuation. The evacuation method does not cause\nshocks that move through the ICM and is, hence, computationally cheaper. The evacuation method models the phase\nof the evolution after the radio-loud AGN has inflated a\nlow-density bubble which has expanded to achieve pressure\nequilibrium with its surroundings (Br\u00fcggen & Kaiser 2001).\nThe inflation of the lobes itself cannot be modelled entirely\nself-consistently as one would have to resolve scales all the\nway down to the accretion disk of the AGN. However, jets\nare observed to inflate spherical bubbles that are in near\npressure equilibrium with the ICM. In order to model the\n\n\fMetal mixing by buoyant bubbles in galaxy clusters\n3.2\n\nFigure 1. Evolution of the metal density profile in the case without bubbles. The metal density increases with time proportional\nto the light profile of the central galaxy. The injection rate is\nassumed to be constant in time. It is apparent that numerical\nmixing is very small. The noise increases at larger radii as the\nrefinement levels go down.\n\nbuoyant rise of these AGN-blown bubbles, it is customary\nto start with an underdense, spherical bubble. Since gas is\nremoved from a small volume in the process of forming the\nbubble, mass is not conserved in this method. However, this\ndoes not affect the density profile of the cluster on the time\nscales that we consider here. In Fig. 8 we show that the differences between methods EVAC and INFL are very small.\nFor both methods, we generate a pair of bubbles every\n\u03c4bbl . For every bubble generation cycle, the position of the\ngenerated bubbles changes. For the next pair of bubbles, the\naxis that connected the previous bubbles is rotated around\nthe y-axis. The angle of rotation is fixed by the demand that\nafter nrot bbl cycles the bubbles are again inflated in the first\nposition. The parameters for our runs are summarised in\nTable 3.\n\n3\n\nRESULTS\n\nTable 3 gives an overview of the simulations described in this\npaper. Primarily, we test the dependence of the resulting\nmetal distribution on the bubble position, size and recurrence time, the background model, the method with which\nbubbles are produced and the resolution of the computational grid.\n3.1\n\nStability test\n\nBefore stirring the ICM with an AGN, we tested whether\nthe cluster remains in hydrostatic equilibrium for a typical\nsimulation time of about 1 Gyr. To this end, we ran a simulation where we injected metals but did not produce any\nbubbles. We found that, both, gas density and metal density\nprofiles remained stable for at least 1 Gyr. Figure 1 shows\nthe evolution of the metal density profile.\nEven after 1 Gyr the 3 refinement levels can be seen in\nthe profiles (where the \"line\" becomes thicker). Numerical\nvelocities are of the order of 1 km s\u22121 inside the grid and of\n15 km s\u22121 at the grid boundary.\n\n5\n\nSingle pair of bubbles\n\nIn the next step, we produced a single pair of bubbles by\nevacuating two spherical regions of radius 10 kpc off-centre\nand on opposite sides of the cluster centre. The distance\nof the bubble centre from the cluster centre is 16 kpc. We\nstudied the effect of this single pair of bubbles on the metal\nprofile in the cluster. In particular, we wanted to compute\nhow much mixing a single pair of bubbles can cause and\nwhat the long term fate of these bubbles is. Figures 2 to 3\nshow the results from this run.\nAs found in previous studies, the bubbles start to\nrise buoyantly and fragment. While rising, they uplift the\nmetals from the centre and distribute them in their wake.\nQuite quickly the bubble fragments into a torus. Associated\nwith this torus is a vortical flow that causes gas to ascend\nthrough the axis of the torus. Along the axis of the torus,\nmetals seem to be transported rather fast. However, this\nmetal spreading seems to be restricted to a narrow region\naround this direction. Spreading along other directions\nseems negligible. The effect is that the metals are spread\nout significantly along the axis of the bubbles leading to a\nvery elongated metal distribution. Globally, the effect of a\nsingle pair of bubbles is not very significant (see cumulative\nmetal mass profile in Fig. 3).\nThe bubbles do not continue to rise indefinitely and\neven after 1 Gyr they do not rise beyond 100 kpc from the\ncentre. When they fragment, their rise velocity decreases.\nThis can easily be seen by equating the drag force to the\nbuoyance force, i.e.\n4 3\n\u03c0\n\u03c0r \u03c1g = Cr 2 \u03c1v 2 ,\n3\n2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere v is the terminal velocity, \u03c1 the density of the ambient\nmedium, g the gravitational acceleration, r the radius of\nthe bubble and C a constant of order unity. This yields the\nterminal velocity\n8rg\n.\n(9)\n3C\n\u221a\nThus, the rise velocity \u221d rbbl (see e.g. Churazov et al.\n(2001)). The fragments form a mushroom-shaped plume, not\nunlike the radio structures observed in M87, and this structure covers a larger azimutal angle. There could be a certain\nradius where most metals are deposited.\nTwo effects can lead to a more isotropic mixing of metals: (i) ambient motions in the cluster that are triggered\nby galaxy motions and merger activity and (ii) a series of\nbubbles that are launched at changing locations in the cluster, for example by a precessing jet or by inhomogeneities\nof the accretion flow near the jet. In the next section, we\ninvestigate the second scenario.\nv2 =\n\n3.3\n\nSeries of bubbles\n\nIn the next set of simulations, we look at the effect of a succession of bubbles that are generated at changing positions\ninside the cluster.\n\n\f6\n\nE.

This is indeed the\ncase as we see by comparing runs EVAC and DISTCTR. If\nbubbles start too far out, they cannot uplift a substantial\namount of metals because most metals are injected mainly\nin the cluster centre (steep metal injection profile) as can be\nseen from Fig. 4.\nIn order to compare metal fraction, metal density and\ncumulative metal mass at different times, these quantities\nare normalised to \u1e40metal0 * t. From this we can conclude\nthat the initial position of the bubbles with respect to the\nscale radius of the metal injection rate has an impact on the\nmixing efficiency of the bubbles. However, as the bubbles\nare produced by jets that are launched from supermassive\nblack holes at the centre of the galaxy, the bubbles will never\nbe inflated too far from the stars that produce the metals.\nWhile in principle the mixing efficiency depends on the initial position of the bubble, the nature of the bubbles will\nensure that this will not cause great differences in the metal\nprofiles. Our generic run has a distance of the bubble centre\nfrom the core of the cluster of \u223c 16 kpc. In reality, bubbles\noccur at a broad range of distances from the centre. The\nlist of known bubbles in Dunn et al. (2005) shows that the\ndistances that we probe lie well within the observed ones.\n\n3.3.2\n\nBubble size\n\nObviously, one important parameter is the size of the bubbles. In our standard scenario we chose a bubble radius of 10\nkpc which is motivated by the sizes of some of the cavities\nobserved in the X-ray surface brightness maps. For example,\nthe cavities of the inner bubbles in Perseus have a radius of\n13 kpc. To test the dependence of the transport efficiency on\nthe bubble size, we compared our standard run with a bubble of twice its radius (8 times its volume). See Fig. 5 for the\ncumulative metal mass profiles. The main inference is that\nlarger bubbles can carry metals out to larger distances. As\n\ncan be seen in Fig. 5, after about 500 Myrs the large bubble\n(r = 20 kpc) carries the metals out to a distance of about\n50 kpc, while the 10 kpc bubble only lifts them to about 25\nkpc.\nThe same trend is apparent from Fig. 6 which shows\nthe normalised radial metal density profile for three different times. The main effect of the bubbles can be seen in\nthe points elevated above the original line. In these cells,\nthe metal density is enhanced because the bubbles have carried the metals to larger radii. It is evident that the larger\nbubbles are more efficient at transporting metals outwards.\nThis behaviour is not surprising because larger bubbles\nrise faster as we saw in Eq. (9). As the bubbles rise faster,\nthey accelerate the metals in its wake to higher velocities\nand they travel further out until instabilities have broken\nthem up such that they do not travel much further.\n\n3.3.3\n\nBubble frequency\n\nClearly, the efficiency with which bubbles can transport metals depends on the frequency with which bubbles are produced by the AGN. In the previous simulations, we employed\na recurrence time of 50 Myr. For comparison, we ran a simulation with a recurrence time of 200 Myrs, all other parameters being the same as in run EVAC.\nThe difference in, both, radius up to which metals are\ncarried and degree of deformation of cumulative metal mass\nprofile can be seen in Fig. 7. After 800 Myrs, comparing the\nblue and grey lines reveals the difference between these two\nruns. The runs with a longer recurrence time leads to appreciably less mixing. A recurrence time that is four times\nlonger, roughly leads to only about 1/3 as much mixing\nby the end of our simulation. Thus, the degree of mixing\nscales roughly with the frequency of bubble generation as\none would expect.\n\n\fMetal mixing by buoyant bubbles in galaxy clusters\n\n7\n\nFigure 2. Simulation of a single bubble pair: Slice through the centre of the computational box showing the local gas density (left\ncolumn) and the metal fraction (right column) at 60 Myr (top) and 250 Myr (bottom). The grid lines indicate the boundaries of the\nblocks. Each block contains 83 computational cells.\n\n3.3.4\n\nComparison between evacuation and inflation\nmethod\n\nIn Fig. 8, we investigate the sensitivity of the metal profiles\nto the way we produce the bubbles. We generate the bubbles\nby either injecting hot gas into a number of computational\ncells or by removing gas mass from a spherical region of\nspace while keeping the pressure constant. Reassuringly, the\ndifferences between the two methods are small. In the evacuation method the bubbles seem to be able to carry metals\n\nout a little bit further. Also the global effect (flattening of\ncumulative metal mass profile, see Fig. 8) is a bit stronger\nin the evacuation scenario. However, all properties concerning the transport of metals in the cluster are very similar\nin both runs. The evacuation method is computationally\nslightly cheaper because the timesteps during the inflation\nphase become quite small. Projections of the gas density, the\nX-ray surface brightness and the normalised metal density\nfor different timesteps are shown in Fig. 9. Therefore, we\nproduce the bubble by evacuation in all our other runs.\n\n\f8\n\nE.

The bottom panel shows the difference between\ncumulative mass with and without mixing.\n\n3.3.5\n\nResolution test\n\nIn these kinds of simulations, it is essential to assess the errors caused by the spatial discretisation. We can compare\nruns EVAC and EVAC HR which have an effective resolution of 1923 and 3843 zones respectively. The morphologies\nof the bubbles are very similar up to 250 Myr and the cumulative mass profiles are practically indistinguishable. In\nFig. 10, we show the normalised cumulative metal mass profiles for runs with resolutions of 1923 zones and 3843 zones.\nThe resultant metal profiles suggest that the simulation have\nconverged numerically.\n\n3.4\n\nThe case of Perseus\n\nHaving discussed a somewhat generic cluster model above,\nwe now turn to the brightest X-ray cluster A426 (Perseus)\nthat has been studied extensively with Chandra and\nXMM-Newton. Our simulations of the Perseus cluster show\ntwo things: (i) In the case of Perseus, the metal distribution\n\nis somewhat broader. This is a result of the greater pressure gradient in Perseus which leads to a greater buoyancy\nforce and thus a higher velocity of the bubbles. (ii) We find\nthat despite varying the initial positions of the bubbles, the\nresulting metal distribution remains fairly elongated and decidedly non-spherical.\nFig. 11 shows the local metal fraction at three different\ntimes in slices through the centre of the cluster. The left\ncolumn is for the generic background cluster (EVAC) and\nright column for the simulation based on Perseus. For the\nPerseus model, the metal disribution is somewhat broader\nthan in our generic model. However, all qualitative features\ndiscussed above for the generic model remain valid for the\ncluster based on Perseus.\n\n3.5\n\nEstimate of diffusion constant\n\nIn this section, we wish to parametrise the transport of metals by computing an effective diffusion constant.

Discretising this between\nthe radii R1 and R2 (i.e. \u2206R = R2 \u2212 R1 and R\u0304 = (R1 +\nR2 )/2) and timesteps t1 and t2 (\u2206t = t2 \u2212 t1 and t\u0304 = (t1 +\nt2 )/2) yields\n\u03c1\u0304metal (R\u0304, t2 ) \u2212 \u03c1\u0304metal (R\u0304, t1 )\n= \u03c1\u0307metal (R\u0304) +\n\u2206t\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u03c1\u0304metal (R2 , t\u0304) \u2212 \u2202r \u03c1\u0304metal (R1 , t\u0304)\n,\n(13)\nD(R\u0304, t\u0304) \u2202r\n\u2206R\nwhere we have assumed that D varies only slowly with radius, i.e. D(R1 , t) \u2248 D(R2 , t) \u2248 D(R\u0304, t).

This is clearly\na simplified picture. In reality, these bubble are inflated by\nrelativistic jets whose physics is still very poorly understood.\nReal AGN jets have a dynamics that can only be fully captured with special-relativistic MHD codes that need to resolve scales much below the scales resolved in our simulations.\nHowever, bubbles such as those set up in our simulations are similar to the bubbles observed in galaxy\nclusters such as the Perseus cluster. The bubbles in Perseus\nand other clusters are nearly in pressure equilibrium with\nthe ambient medium, they are nearly spherical and move\nsubsonically through the ICM. Thus, we ignore the entire\nprocess that has led to the formation of these bubbles and\nfocus solely on the buoyancy-driven motions of the bubbles.\nThere have been some attempts to simulate the\ninflation of the bubbles by a jet and assess its consequences\nfor the ICM. Omma et al. (2004) simulate the effect of\nslow jets on a cool core in a galaxy cluster. Simulations\nby Vernaleo & Reynolds (2006) show that jets launched in\n\n\f10\n\nE.

Evolution of the normalised metal density profile (top panel) and the normalised cumulative metal mass profile (metal mass\ninside r, middle panel). The bottom panel shows the difference between mixing and no mixing. Here we illustrate the impact of the initial\nbubble position and the initial bubble sizes. Shown are results from runs EVAC, DISTCTR and LARGEBBL.\n\na hydrostatic cluster fail to heat the cluster on long time\nscales because the jet forms a low-density channel through\nwhich the material can flow freely, carrying its energy out\nof the cooling core.\nIf bubbles in a hydrostatic cluster are launched repeatedly at the same position, the resulting metal distribution\nbecomes very aspherical and elongated along the axis of the\nbubble. If, however the bubbles are launched at changing\npositions, the metal distribution is somewhat isotropised.\nHowever, as is apparent e.g. from Fig. 11, even when we vary\nthe bubble position within a cone of \u223c 30 deg, the resulting metal distribution remains elongated and non-spherical.\nThus, if the metal distribution should turn out to be spherical, this would necessitate additional motions caused for\nexample by mergers or by stirring by galaxies in order to\nisotropise the metals.\nIn real clusters, the ICM is not in hydrostatic equilibrium and can show strong motions. Galaxies that fly\nthrough the cluster produce motions and turbulence.\nMerger activity can stir the ICM even more violently.\nThese motions will all contribute to dispersing the metals\nthroughout the ICM. Moreover, density anisotropies can\ncause the bubbles to move away from the axis of the AGN\njet, as the bubbles follow the local density gradient. Indeed,\nin quite a few clusters, most famously in M87, the bubbles\nare widely dispersed through the cluster and do not trace\nthe alleged axis of the AGN jet. Heinz et al. (2006) have\nperformed three-dimensional adaptive-mesh simulations of\n\njets situated at the centre of a cluster drawn from a cosmological simulation. These simulations show that cluster\ninhomogeneities and large-scale flows have a significant\nimpact on the morphology of the bubbles. Moreover, these\nmotions help to prevent the formation of channels along\nthe bubbles axes as found by Vernaleo & Reynolds (2006).\nThe diffusion coefficients inferred from our simple experiments lie at values of around \u223c 1029 cm2 s\u22121 at a radius\nof 10 kpc. Right at the centre, they rise to about \u223c 1031\ncm2 s\u22121 and fall to about \u223c 1025 cm2 s\u22121 at a radius of 100\nkpc. Modulo a factor of a few, the coefficients for all runs lie\naround these values. Differences are induced by the bubble\nsizes, the initial positions, the recurrence times and the pressure profile in the cluster. Interestingly, the runs modelled\non the Perseus cluster yield diffusion coefficients that agree\nvery well with those estimated by assuming a simple diffusion model (see Rebusco et al. (2005)). As we do not take\ninto account motions that may have been induced by mergers etc., the values for the diffusion coefficients constitute\nlower limits on the real values. Thus, we can conclude that\nAGN-induced motions are sufficient to explain the broad\nabundance peaks in clusters. It is also striking that the diffusion coefficients fall so steeply with radial distance from\nthe centre. Over two decades in radius they decrease by almost 10 orders of magnitude. Very approximately, they fall\nlike r \u22125 . This strong radial dependence of the transport efficiency is, partially, a result of the three-dimensional nature\nof the bubble-induced motions, i.e. uplifted metals are di-\n\n\fMetal mixing by buoyant bubbles in galaxy clusters\n\n11\n\nFigure 6. Normalised radial metal density profile for three different times. A random subset of cells is chosen (same weight for each\nradius). Metal density is normalised to t\u1e40metal 0 . Left column is for EVAC, right column for LARGEBBL. The main effect of the bubbles\ncan be seen in the points elevated above the original line. In these cells, the metal density is enhanced because the bubbles have carried\nthe metals to larger radii. It is apparent that the larger bubbles are more efficient at transporting metals outwards.\n\nluted over the entire radial shell. A second effect is the decaying \"lift\" power of the bubbles as they rise. The bubbles\naccelerate only at the beginning of their ascent through the\ncluster. However, very quickly instabilities set in that slow\ndown the bubble until it finally comes to a halt at about\n100 kpc from the centre. The maximal lift power is attained\nwhen the bubbles are still intact and have their largest velocity. This occurs at radii of about 20 kpc - 30 kpc, and this coincides with peaks in the diffusion coefficient as can be seen\nfrom Fig. 12, particularly for runs EVAC and PERSEUS 50.\nFinally, we may add that if hydrodynamic instabilities\nare suppressed by magnetic fields or viscous forces, for example, the bubbles would stay intact for longer and could\nrise to greater distances thus also enhancing the diffusion\ncoefficients at larger radii.\n\n5\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn a series of numerical experiments, we have performed a\nsystematic study on the effect of bubble-induced motions\non metallicity profiles in clusters of galaxies. In particular,\nwe have studied the dependence on the bubble size and positions, the recurrence times of the bubbles, the way these\nbubbles are inflated and the underlying cluster profile.\nOn the basis of our 3D hydro simulations, we wish to\nmake the following main points:\n\u2022 Larger bubbles lead to mixing to larger radii. For realistic parameters and in the absence of stabilising forces,\nbubbles hardly move beyond distances of 150 kpc from the\ncentre.\n\u2022 Mixing scales roughly with bubble frequency.\n\n\f12\n\nE.
