[1] There\nis mounting evidence indicating that this IC is due to\nthe formation of charge stripes. [2] One way of understanding the relationship between magnetic and charge\nfluctuations, as well as their impact in other properties\nof these materials, is by introducing NMI in the Cu-O\nplanes. Some of these experimental results are puzzling.\nIt has been observed that replacing Cu2+ by Zn2+ depletes antiferromagnetism without causing spin IC even\nat 25% doping. [3] It is estimated that an impurity content as large as 30-40% will be required to destroy AF\norder in this case. [4,5] While the addition of MH (Sr in\nLa2\u2212x Srx CuO4 (LSCO)) to lightly Zn-doped materials\nproduces spin IC similar to the one observed in LSCO,\n[6] doping with Li, which introduces equal numbers of localized impurities and mobile holes does not induce spin\nIC at 10% Li doping of La2 CuO4 (LCO). [7]\nThe goal of this paper is to gain theoretical understanding on the effect of NMI doping on cuprates. Numerical studies of Hubbard and t-J models, the Hamiltonians traditionally used to study the physics of the\ncuprates, are very difficult at low temperatures. A simpler spin-fermion model has been used successfully to understand magnetic and charge properties in these materials, showing that spin IC and charge stripe formation\nare related. [8] The spin-fermion model is constructed\nas an interacting system of electrons and spins, crudely\nmimicking phenomenologically the coexistence of charge\nand spin degrees of freedom in the cuprates. [9\u201311]. Its\n\nhiji\u03b1\n\ni\n\nhiji\n\n(1)\nwhere c\u2020i\u03b1 creates an electron at site i = (ix , iy ) with spin\nP\nprojection \u03b1, si = \u03b1\u03b2 c\u2020i\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 ci\u03b2 is the spin of the mobile electron, the Pauli matrices are denoted by \u03c3, Si is\nthe localized spin at site i, hiji denotes nearest-neighbor\n(NN) lattice sites, t is the NN-hopping amplitude for the\nelectrons, J > 0 is an AF coupling between the spins of\nthe mobile and localized degrees of freedom, and J\u2032 > 0\nis a direct AF coupling between the localized spins. The\ndensity hni=1 \u2212 x of itinerant electrons is controlled by a\nchemical potential \u03bc. Hereafter t = 1 will be used as the\nunit of energy. \u00bfFrom previous phenomenological analysis the coupling J is expected to be larger than t, while the\nHeisenberg coupling J\u2032 is expected to be smaller. [10,11,8]\nThe value of J will be here fixed to 2 and the coupling\nJ\u2032 = 0.5, as in Ref. [8]. To simplify the numerical calculations, avoiding the sign problem, localized spins are\nassumed to be classical (with |Si |=1). This approximation is not as drastic as it appears and it was discussed\nin detail in Ref. [8]. The model will be studied using\na Monte Carlo (MC) method, details of which can be\nfound in Ref. [12]. Periodic boundary conditions (PBC)\nare mainly used but it has been checked that the results\npresented here are independent of the boundary conditions.\nDoping with Zn will be simulated by randomly removing localized spins. This is achieved by turning J = 0\nat the impurity site and J \u2032 = 0 along the four links that\nconnect the impurity to neighboring sites. Li doping has\n1\n\n\fadding NMI is to reduce the intensity of the structure\nfactor since spins are being removed. It is clear that random impurities do not destroy the AF order as can be\nobserved from a snapshot at 15 % doping for the spins on\nthe plane X-Z (Fig.1-b). The snapshot also shows a uniform charge distribution. This is in complete agreement\nwith experimental data for Zn doping in LCO. [6] Our\nsimulations can produce dynamical information directly\nin real-frequency without the need of carrying out (uncontrolled) analytic extrapolations from the imaginary\naxis. This allows us to study the behavior of the density of states (DOS). In Fig.1-c the DOS as a function of\n%NMI doping is presented. The addition of localized impurities creates states inside the gap which are indicated\nby a black filling in the figure. Analyzing the spectral\nfunctions A(q, \u03c9), it was observed that these states have\nvery small dispersion which added to the absence of spectral weight at the chemical potential indicates that the\nsystem remains an insulator, in agreement with experiments. [3]\n\nto be treated differently. Since it is in an oxidation state\nLi+ (while Cu and Zn are 2+), the ion effectively acts\nas a negative charge center. To simulate this effect the\nhopping t that connects the impurity to neighboring sites\nshould be reduced. In addition, the Li ion is closed shell\nand thus, non-magnetic. This feature is simulated as in\nthe case of Zn, by randomly removing localized spin degrees of freedom. An additional effect of Li doping is\nthe introduction of one MH, thus the chemical potential\nhas to be tuned such that the percentage of mobile holes\nequals the percentage of localized impurities.\nTo study the magnetic properties of the system the\nspin-spin correlationP\nfunctions among the classical spins\ndefined as \u03c9(r) = N1 i hSi *Si+r i (where N is the number\nof sites) was measured. Its Fourier transform provides the\nspin structure factor S(q).

In this case only a\nsmall fraction of the %Sr-%Zn plane has been explored\nexperimentally. Studies were performed for 0 \u2264 %Zn \u2264\n25 and 0 \u2264 %Sr \u2264 3 [4], 0 \u2264 %Zn \u2264 75 and %Sr = 15\n[13], 12% Zn and 14% Sr [6], 0 \u2264 %Zn \u2264 12 and 15% Sr\n[14], 0 \u2264 %Zn \u2264 4 and 10% Sr [15], 0 \u2264 %Zn \u2264 40 and\n\nIn Fig.1-a the structure factor for different concentrations of localized NMI, like Zn, is shown for an 8 \u00d7 8 lattice at temperature T = 0.01t and at hni=1 since doping\nwith Zn does not modify the density of itinerant electrons. It can be seen that the peak remains at (\u03c0, \u03c0) for\nall the studied NMI concentrations. The only effect of\n\n2\n\n\facross the impurity which eventually will give rise to spin\nIC (see Fig.2-c) [19,20]. According to this result, spin IC\nshould be detected in the region %Sr > %Zn, more specifically, when the percentage of Sr is larger than that of Zn\nby approximately 5% according to experimental results\nfor LSCO. This is in agreement with our observations if\nit is taken into account that due to the finite size of our\nsystem, spin IC is first detected when the peak in the\nstructure factor is at (\u03c0, 3\u03c0/4) and symmetrical points.\nThus, it is here predicted that spin IC should be experimentally observed in samples with %Sr > %Zn. Notice\nthat, due to the fact that the stripe structure is modified by NMI doping this may not be the same kind of\nIC observed in LSCO. In fact, it is possible that besides\nthe magnetic peaks at (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b4, \u03c0) and symmetrical points,\nless intense peaks may appear at (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b4, \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b4). More\ngenerally, as the percentage of NMI increases, IC peaks\nmaybe observed in all directions in momentum space.\nThe DOS indicates that in this situation the system has\nmetallic characteristics although the chemical potential\nis in a pseudogap as shown in Fig.2-d. This feature is also\nin agreement with experiments. [21] A study of the spectral function shows that the states indicated with black,\nhave very little dispersion. From the figure it can be seen\nthat some mobile holes are trapped in these states and\nbecome almost localized but the extra mobile holes go\ninto the dispersive states that form the pseudogap.\n\n0% Sr [3]. Numerous experiments have also been performed on LSCO (without Zn). For 0 \u2264 %Sr \u2264 25 neutron scattering experiments are presented in Ref. [16].\nZn-doped YBa2 Cu3 O7\u2212\u03b4 (YBCO) has also been studied\nwith 0 \u2264 %Zn \u2264 4 and the O content varying between 6.6\nand 7, which roughly corresponds to a percentage of MH\nranging between 9-15%. [17,15]. These regions are shown\nin Fig.2-a. In the same figure the magnetic and charge\nproperties of the model Eq.(1) in the plane %Sr \u2212 %Zn\nobtained from the present study are presented. In the\nabsence of NMI, the addition of MH induces stripe formation, as well as spin IC. The stripes are either horizontal or vertical [8] and a snapshot for 15% MH and\nno localized impurities is shown in Fig.2-b. As it can be\nseen in the figure, the electronic density is depressed near\nthe stripe indicating that perpendicular fluctuations are\npresent, i.e., there is short range movement of holes in\nthe direction perpendicular to the stripe.\nWhen localized NMI are added they tend to trap holes.\nThis reduces the effective hopping towards the impurity's\nnearest neighbor sites and diagonal stripes anchored by\nthe impurities tend to develop as boundaries of AF domains. This effect is similar to the formation of diagonal stripes due to pinning experimentaly observed. [18]\nAn example of this behavior is shown in Fig.2-c where 3\nNMI (i.e. 5% Zn) have been added to the system with\nhni \u2248 0.85. A \u03c0\u2212shift also occurs between the AF domains separated by the diagonal stripes. For some distributions of Zn impurities both diagonal and non-diagonal\nstripes, pinned by the impurities, coexist.\n\n(a)\n\n(b) 60\n50\n\n0%\n\n(a)\n\n40\n\nS(q)\n\n30\n\n(c) %Zn\n\n%Sr\n\n20\n\n5%\n\n8%\n\n8%\n\n10\n0\n\n1.0\n0.5\n1.0\n\n15%\n\n12%\n\n20%\n\n12%\n\n23%\n\n18%\n\n31%\n\n20%\n\n0%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n40%\n\n(0,0)\n\n10%\n\n(\u03c0,0)\n\nq\n\n(\u03c0,\u03c0)\n\n(0,0)\n\n(c)\n\n0.45\n\n60\n\n(b)50\n40\n\nS(q)\n\n30\n\n10\n\n(0,0)\n\n\u22122 0\n(\u03c0,0) q (\u03c0,\u03c0)\n\n1.0\n\n40%\n\n8% Zn 8% Sr\n15% Zn 12% Sr\n20% Zn 12% Sr\n23% Zn 18% Sr\n31% Zn 20% Sr\n\n20\n\n0\n\n20%\n\n(0,0)\n\n2\n\n\u03c9\u2212\u03bc\n\n\u22124 \u22122\n\n0\n\n2\n\n\u03c9\u2212\u03bc\n\n4\n\n0.5\n1.0\n0.45\n\nFIG. 4.

Though the hopping towards the impurity sites is t = 1, the electrons prefer to stay away from\nthat site, since the coupling J is zero and the observed\n\nIt has also been observed that while a localized impurity does not disturb the AF background, when the\nnumber of mobile holes is larger than the number of localized impurities a \u03c0\u2212shift occurs in the x and y directions\n\n3\n\n\fbe identical to the one observed in LSCO. When the percentage of MH is equal to or smaller than the NMI, the\nmobile holes are trapped by the impurities and the system remains insulator and magnetically commensurate.\nThus, based on our study, it is predicted that incommensuration should not be experimentally observed in this\nsituation, and that samples with equal percentages of Sr\nand Zn should behave similarly to the Li doped ones.\nA.M. is supported by NSF under grant DMR-9814350.\nAdditional support is provided by the National High\nMagnetic Field Lab and MARTECH.\n\nelectronic density in them is just hni i \u2248 0.03, which indicates that the holes are very localized at the impurity\nsites. Notice that the hole localization, which is observed\nexperimentally [13,4], appears naturally in our calculations, while it has to be assumed in other theoretical\napproaches. [22] The system is magnetically commensurate and the structure factor peaks at (\u03c0, \u03c0) as shown in\nFig.3-b for different values of %Zn \u2265 %Sr. In these circumstances the system is an insulator as it can be seen\nin Fig.3-c where the DOS is displayed. When %Zn=%Sr\nthe chemical potential lies in a gap separating dispersive\nfrom non-dispersive states. When %Zn > %Sr the chemical potential is located at the non-dispersive states. In\nboth cases the system is an insulator. As mentioned before, very few experiments where performed in this region\nof the plane. However, our results are in agreement with\nthe available data since insulating behavior was found\nfor %Sr = 15 and %Zn \u2265 15 Ref. [13] and %Sr = 3 and\n%Zn \u2265 3 Ref. [4].\nNote that the behavior observed along the line\n%Sr = %Zn is in qualitative agreement with the experimental results available for Li doped LCO. It is well\nknown that the system is an insulator up to the maximum possible percentage of Li (50%) [23,24] and at 10%\ndoping spin IC is not observed [7] which was very unexpected. Thus, these results indicate that qualitatively, Li\ndoping should be equivalent to equal percentages of Zn\nand Sr doping. However, in order to represent Li doping\nmore accurately, it has to be considered that Li is less\npositively charged than Zn and Cu and thus it should\nact as an attractor of mobile holes. To mimic this behavior the hopping towards the impurity sites should be\nreduced. In our previous results it has been observed\nthat t=1 tends to greatly localize the mobile holes since\nthe electronic density at the impurity sites is only 0.03.\nThus, any smaller value of t will not introduce important\nqualitative changes but, for completness, and since it has\nbeen used in other approaches, [22] the results for t=0\nnear NMI are also presented. In this case the MH get\ntrapped by the impurity and become totally localized.\nThis can be seen in Fig.4-a where the density of states\nis shown for different percentages of Li dopping. Localized states (marked in black), which do not disperse with\nmomentum, proportional to the number of added holes\nappear in the density of states, and the chemical potential\nlies inside a gap indicating that the system is insulator as\nexperimentally found. [25,24]. Incommensurability is not\nobserved as it can be seen in Fig.4-b where the structure\nfactor is displayed. A snapshot is presented in Fig.4-c.\nSummarizing, the effect of adding non-magnetic impurities to a model of interacting fermions and classical\nspins has been investigated using MC techniques. When\nthe percentage of mobile holes is larger than the NMI,\ncharge and spin IC is observed. The NMI act as pinning centers for the horizontal and vertical stripes that\nare observed in the absence of vacancies. The pinned\nstripes tend to become diagonal and surround AF domains. Thus, the observed incommensuration may not\n\n[1] S-W. Cheong et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 67, 1791 (1991);\nP. Dai et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 80, 1738 (1998);\nH.A.
