Introduction\nOver the past decade our understanding of the solar interior has improved significantly. Today with the precise helioseismic data available from the GONG (Global\nOscillation Network Group) ground based instruments\nand the SOHO (SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory)\nspace experiments (Gough et al. 1996; Thompson et\nal. 1996; Fr\u00f6hlich et al. 1997; Gabriel et al. 1997; Schou\net al. 1998), the detailed internal structure and complex\ndynamics of our star can be inferred with reasonable accuracy using inversion techniques. In addition to sound\nspeed c and density \u03c1 profiles, the internal rotation rate\n\u03a9 can also be inferred. It reveals that on the top of an\nalmost uniformly rotating radiation zone (with a rotation\nperiod of about 28 days), the bulk of the convection zone is\ndifferentially rotating with properties close to what is deduced from sunspot tracking, i.e., a period at the equator\nof 25 days and at the pole of 33 days corresponding to a\ncontrast \u2206\u03a9 of 30%. The sharp transition region between\nthese two distinct zones, located around 0.7R\u2299 , has been\ncalled the tachocline (Spiegel & Zahn 1992); it is thought\nSend offprint requests to: A.S. Brun\n\nIndeed, it appears that the solar structure deduced\nfrom helioseismology and the observed photospheric compositions can not be explained adequately without invoking some mixing in the radiative interior (Brun et\nal. 1999). This conclusion has been drawn after a careful\nstudy of the microscopic processes present in solar models (Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. 1996; Morel, Provost &\nBerthomieu 1997; Bahcall, Basu & Pinsonneault 1998a;\nBrun, Turck-Chi\u00e8ze & Morel 1998). More precisely, in\nthe early 90's, after significant improvements in the description of the solar plasma through better equation of\nstate, opacities and nuclear reaction rates, helioseismic\nstudies have established the need for microscopic diffusion of helium and heavy elements in the radiative interior (Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. 1993). But it was soon\nrealized that models including only microscopic diffusion\nexhibit sharp composition gradients below the base of the\nconvection zone which are not consistent with helioseismic\ndata; these favour instead smoother composition profiles\nwithin this region (Basu & Antia 1994). In spite of further improvements in solar models, this discrepancy still\npersists around 0.7 R\u2299 (Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. 1996;\n\n\f2\n\nA.S. Brun et al.: Seismic tests for solar models with tachocline mixing\n\nBrun et al. 1998), suggesting that some extra mixing must\nbe implemented in the models.\nFurther, using primary inversions for sound speed and\ndensity and the equations of thermal equilibrium, Antia &\nChitre (1998) have inferred the hydrogen abundance profile in the radiative interior. This profile confirms the presence of such mixing in the Sun, as the hydrogen abundance\nappears to be almost constant in the region r > 0.68R\u2299 .\nAnother evidence for mixing occurring in that region\ncomes from the photospheric light elements composition.\nPurely microscopic processes cannot reproduce the under\nabundance of lithium observed in the Sun and in open\nclusters (Grevesse, Noels & Sauval 1996; Cayrel 1998;\nRichard et al. 1996; Turcotte et al. 1998; Brun et al. 1999).\nWe are thus compelled to introduce some mixing processes in the stably stratified radiative interior. The possible causes of instabilities leading to such mixing are the\nsolar rotation, the magnetic field or penetrative convection (Zahn 1998). The recent study of Balachandran &\nBell (1998) on the photospheric light elements abundance\nof 7 Li and 9 Be puts strong constraints on the extent, amplitude and location of such instabilities. It is now believed that only the lithium is significantly depleted, by\nmore than a factor of 100 in comparison to the meteoritic\ncomposition, while the beryllium has varied by only 10%\nover the last 4.6 Gyr. The temperatures at which these\ntwo species are destroyed by nuclear burning are respectively \u223c 2.7 \u00d7 106 K (at 0.66R\u2299 ) and \u223c 3.2 \u00d7 106 K (at\n0.59R\u2299 ), which are relatively close to the temperature at\nthe base of the convection zone \u223c 2.2 \u00d7 106 K at 0.713R\u2299\n(Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. 1991). This implies that any\nmacroscopic processes for such lithium destruction have to\nbe located near the top of the radiation zone and cannot\nextend deeper than (\u223c 8%) in solar radius without producing an excessive destruction of 9 Be.\nThis requirement is satisfied if the mixing is confined\nin the tachocline. For this reason, Brun et al. (1999)\ncalculated the mixing occurring in that layer, based\non Spiegel & Zahn's hydrodynamical description of the\ntachocline. They found indeed that such mixing improved\nthe agreement between the models and the Sun, provided the secular variation of the tachocline was taken\ninto account. Alternative approaches based on gravity\nwaves (Montalban & Schatzman 1996) and magnetic field\n(Barnes, Charbonneau & MacGregor 1999) have also been\nstudied.\nIn this paper we intend to go further in understanding the influence of tachocline mixing on the solar internal structure and composition by using the powerful seismic diagnostic. In particular, we examine the cumulative\neffect of varying, within their intrinsic uncertainties, the\nbasic microscopic ingredients such as the nuclear reaction\ncross sections, the microscopic diffusion coefficients, etc.\nSeismic probing of the solar structure has been improved\nto a level where it can be used to constrain physical processes, since the Sun provides a ready-made cosmic laboratory for testing various aspects of physics. For example, there have been some attempts to constrain the nu-\n\nclear reaction rate for pp reaction using helioseismic data\n(Antia & Chitre 1998, 1999; Degl'Innocenti, Fiorentini &\nRicci 1998; Schlattl, Bonanno & Paterno 1999). These\nstudies indicate that the cross-section for pp reaction needs\nto be increased by a few percent over the currently accepted value (Adelberger et al. 1998). Using a similar approach Weiss, Flaskamp & Tsytovich (2001) found that\nenhancing the electron screening by about 5% improves\nthe agreement between solar model and helioseismically\ninferred sound speed. Therefore, we would like to revise,\namong other quantities, the pp cross-section deduced from\nhelioseismology, by using in our solar models either the\nweak (Salpeter 1954) or intermediate (Mitler 1977) treatment for electron screening. We also deduce the photospheric hydrogen abundance Xph , the maximum extent h\nof the tachocline mixing allowed in a solar model and predict the theoretical neutrino fluxes in light of the recent\nSNO results (Ahmad et al. 2001, 2002).\nWe have organised our paper as follows. In section 2,\nwe briefly recall how we compute our 1-D solar models\nwith or without the presence of tachocline mixing, describe our inversion techniques of the solar acoustic frequencies and demonstrate the need for further progress\nin solar modelling. In section 3, we present our latest results on the sound speed, density, hydrogen abundance\nand temperature profiles obtained with our modified solar tachocline models and discuss the resulting neutrino\nfluxes. Finally in section 4, we comment on our findings\nand outline our conclusions.\n\n2. Modelling Approach\n2.1. Construction of solar models with tachocline\nmixing\nIn order to model the Sun, we use the CESAM code (Morel\n1997), which solves the structure equations (Kippenhahn\n& Weigert 1994) in time and space for a spherically symmetric star of one solar mass (M\u2299 ) in mechanical and\nthermal equilibrium. Once the evolved structure of a given\nmodel reaches the age of 4.6 Gyr, including a pre main\nsequence (PMS) phase of \u223c 50 Myr, it is calibrated to\nthe solar radius R\u2299 , luminosity L\u2299 and surface heavy elements abundance (Z/X)ph to within an accuracy of 10\u22125\n(see Table 1). This is done by modifying the mixing length\nparameter \u03b1, the initial helium Y0 and heavy elements\nZ0 abundances. This accurate calibration of solar values\nis crucial and allows us to test different solutions in our\nsearch for the best agreement between our models and the\nSun. We refer to Brun et al. (1998) for a more detailed description of our solar models.\nThe macroscopic mixing present in the tachocline is\nmodelled by adding to the equation for chemical evolution\nan effective time dependent diffusion coefficient DT (r, t),\nbased on the hydrodynamical description of the tachocline\ndeveloped by Spiegel & Zahn (1992). In their study they\ninvoked the anisotropy of the turbulence in a stratified\nmedium to explain the thinness of this layer. We refer to\n\n\fA.S.

(1999) for a complete description of the different steps followed to deduce from their model the effective\nturbulent diffusivity DT (r, t) used in this work. This coefficient depends on two parameters:\n\u2022 the tachocline thickness at the solar age, h (or the closely\nrelated quantity d \u223c 2h), a relatively well-known quantity\n(Antia et al. 1998; Corbard et al. 1999, see Table 1),\n\u2022 the Brunt-V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency N /2\u03c0, which varies with\ndepth and is taken as constant in this model, representing\nsome average over the tachocline; furthermore, it depends\non the extent of overshoot and its value is therefore somewhat uncertain.\nThe time dependence of the angular velocity is based on\nthe Skumanich law (Skumanich 1972), e.g., \u03a9(t) \u221d t\u22121/2 .\nThis law is not adequate for the early phases of the solar evolution when the star contracts and/or exchanges\nangular momentum with its accretion disk (see Piau &\nTurck-Chi\u00e8ze 2001). Nevertheless, for this study concerned\nmainly with the present day Sun, it is satisfactory.\n\n2.2. Inversion techniques\nTo test and constrain the solar models, we compare their\nsound speed, density, temperature and hydrogen abundance profiles with seismically deduced ones. The sound\nspeed and density profiles are inferred using a Regularised\nLeast Squares (RLS) inversion technique (Antia 1996).\nThis primary inversion is based only on the equations of\nmechanical equilibrium, and has been tested through extensive comparisons (e.g., Gough et al. 1996). For these\nprimary inversions, we use a set of modes in the range\nof harmonic degree l < 190, obtained from the first 360\ndays of operation of the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI)\n(Schou et al. 1998). The inversion results in the central\n\n3\n\nregion depend on the set of low degree acoustic modes\nused (i.e., l \u2264 2, Basu et al. 2000) but not to the extent of\nmodifying the conclusions of this work. To infer secondary\nquantities such as temperature and chemical composition\nwithin the Sun, we follow the treatment given by Antia &\nChitre (1998).\nApart from evolutionary solar models, we also construct some static ones, using a composition profile calculated by the evolutionary stellar structure code CESAM.\nThese models use the same physical inputs as the evolutionary models, but include a different treatment of atmosphere, using the atmospheric model of Vernazza et\nal. (1981) as well as the opacity tables from Kurucz (1991)\nat low temperatures and the formulation of Canuto &\nMazzitelli (1991) to calculate the convective flux. Because\nof these differences the surface layers in the Sun are better\nrepresented in these static models.\n\n2.3. Earlier results\nBefore introducing any new modifications in our evolutionary solar models, let us recall what are the strengths\nand weaknesses of the tachocline models of Brun et\nal. (1999).\n\nFig. 1. The relative difference in sound speed and density\nprofiles between the Sun and solar models is shown as a\nfunction of fractional radius. Model ref including only microscopic diffusion is represented with a solid line and the\nmixed models Btz and its static equivalent with respectively a short-dashed and long-dashed lines. Superimposed\non model ref is the 1\u03c3 error envelope coming from the\nhelioseismic inversion.\nIn Fig. 1 we represent the relative sound speed and\ndensity differences \u03b4c/c and \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1 between the seismic Sun\nobtained using the inversion procedure described above\nand our purely microscopic diffusive model, hereafter re-\n\n\f4\n\nA.S. Brun et al.: Seismic tests for solar models with tachocline mixing\n\nferred to as ref model or a typical tachocline model of Brun\net al. (1999), namely, model Btz . A first quick look reveals\nthat the mixed model Btz shows a better overall agreement both for density and sound speed compared to the\nreference one. For both these quantities, the transition at\nthe base of the homogeneous convection zone is smoother,\nresulting in an almost disappearance of the pronounced\npeak seen in \u03b4c/c of model ref. Further, the hydrogen\nabundance in the convective envelope is slightly closer to\nthe seismic one, due mainly to the limiting action of the\nmacroscopic mixing on the gravitational settling of the\nchemical elements (see Table 3). Brun et al. (1999) found\nthat macroscopic mixing at the base of the convection\nzone reduces by 25% the microscopic diffusion in comparison to a purely microscopic model such as ref. Moreover,\nas we shall see in \u00a73.3, the hydrogen abundance profile is\nsmoother and does not exhibit any sharp gradient just below the base of the convection zone. Further, the lithium\ndepletion achieved in the mixed model is significant, of the\norder of 100, and follows quantitatively well the open cluster observations, such as in the Hyades, or older clusters\nsuch as NGC 752. On the other hand, model ref burns its\nlithium mainly in the PMS phase with only a tiny fraction\nbeing depleted during the main sequence evolution due to\ngravitational settling.\nIn Fig. 1 we also compare the sound speed and density profiles of a typical static model which has been constructed using the same physical inputs as in model Btz\nincluding its composition profiles as well. In the interior,\nthe sound speed of the static model is almost the same as\nthat of the evolutionary model, while in the outer layers\nit represents better that of the Sun. This improvement is\nmost probably due to better treatment of surface layers in\nthe static model through the use of a different prescription to calculate convective flux and also the adoption of\na better atmospheric model.\nDespite all the positive aspects, solar models including\ntachocline mixing still need further improvements. Model\nBtz , for example, shows significant departure from the\nseismic Sun in its density profile, even though this quantity\nis in better agreement in comparison to model ref. Further,\nit assumes a photospheric value for the heavy elements,\n(Z/X)s \u223c 0.0255 which is somewhat higher than the observed value. The reason is that a model calibrated to\n(Z/X)s = 0.0245, such as model Bt in Brun et al. (1999),\nis not as close to the seismic Sun as model Btz , because of\na smaller Z content and to the resulting variation of the\nopacities in the radiative interior. Therefore, we would like\nto reach between our new models and the Sun an agreement in density and sound speed better than that with\nmodel Btz , but without having to relax the (Z/X)s constraint in the calibration process. Finally, the lithium depletion in the PMS phase is overestimated, indicating the\nneed for a better treatment of this early phase of evolution. All the cited improvements can come both from a\nbetter treatment of the mixing at the top of the radiation zone or by a better microscopic description. We refer\nto Piau & Turck-Chi\u00e8ze (2001) for a careful study of the\n\nPMS lithium depletion problem and focus our attention\non the present Sun. We propose to keep for most of our\nmodels the same treatment for the tachocline mixing as introduced in Brun et al. (1999) but to allow for variations\nwithin uncertainties of the main physical ingredients, in\norder to see if any improvements can be obtained before\nintroducing a new description of the tachocline mixing.\n\n3. Improved solar models\n3.1. Model parameters\nWe see from the foregoing discussion that there is still need\nto improve our mixed tachocline models. In this section we\noutline the modifications and models computed for this\nstudy, which for the sake of clarity are also summarised\nin Table 2 with their designation and the corresponding\nchoice of parameters.\n\nTotal \u03b5\n\nD\u2212p\nLi7\u2212p\n\npp\nCNO\nHe3\u2212He3\n\nHe3\u2212He4\n\nFig. 2. Contribution to the nuclear energy generation of\nthe main pp-chain and CNO cycles nuclear reactions as a\nfunction of the normalised solar radius.\n\u2022\npp nuclear reaction: When dealing with the properties of the solar core one is inevitably led to the nuclear reaction rates and their intrinsic uncertainties (Brun\net al. 1998, Bahcall et al. 1998a; Morel et al. 1999).\nUnfortunately, the fundamental nuclear reaction in the\npp-chain, i.e., p + p \u2192 D +e+ + \u03bd, is an electroweak interaction and its cross section has not been determined\nvia direct experimentation. Recent theoretical works give\nan uncertainty of about 1\u20132% in the determination of S11\n(Adelberger et al. 1998). But a seismic calibration of this\ncross section indicated that up to a 4% increase is favoured\n(Antia & Chitre 1998). We have therefore decided to allow\nin our models for a variation up to 4% of this dominant\ncross-section and will also determine which value of S11 (0)\ngives the best agreement with helioseismic inversion.\nAside the fundamental pp nuclear reaction, other reactions can possibly modify the central structure of the\nSun. In Fig. 2 we plot the energy production of the dominant nuclear reactions from the pp chains as well as\n\n\fA.S. Brun et al.: Seismic tests for solar models with tachocline mixing\n\n5\n\nTable 2.

These reactions are the following: D(p, \u03b3)3 He, 3 He(3 He, 2p)4 He,\n3\nHe(\u03b1, \u03b3)7 Be, 7 Li(p, \u03b1)4 He from the pp chains and\n13\nC(p, \u03b3)14 N, 14 N(p, \u03b3)15 O(e+ \u03bd)15 N, 15 N(p, \u03b1)12 C from\nthe CNO cycle. To plot these curves we have used the\ninternal structure of ref model for the present Sun.\nNot all the nuclear reactions displayed in Fig. 2 are\nexpected to modify the thermal structure of the solar core.\nWe can already discard some of them by considering either\ntheir importance in the energy budget or the time they\nrequire to reach equilibrium.\n\u2022 CNO cycle nuclear reactions: Because the Sun is a\nlow mass star, we don't expect the CNO nuclear reactions\nto significantly influence the solar central region since the\ncycle contributes to less than 2% of the total nuclear energy production (Clayton 1968; Bahcall 1989; Bahcall,\nPinsonneault & Basu 2001). We have therefore not introduced any modification of these reactions in our models\nand refer to Turck-Chi\u00e8ze et al. (2001) for a discussion of\ntheir influence on the solar structure.\n\u2022\nD-p and 7 Li-p nuclear reactions: Because the lifetime of deuterium and lithium is very short, these elements quickly reach equilibrium abundance in the temperature and density range prevailing in the solar core.\nConsequently, these reactions do not have a significant\nimpact on the core structure even though there are very\nenergetic. We refer to Gautier & Morel (1997) for a discussion of the important D/H astrophysical ratio and to\nBrun et al. (1999) for a study of the influence of the 7 Li-p\ncross section on photospheric lithium abundance. We will\nadopt in all our models the cross sections proposed by the\nNACRE compilation (Angulo et al. 1999).\n\u2022 3 He\u22123 He and 3 He\u22124 He nuclear reactions: These nuclear cross sections play a crucial role in determining the\nbranching between the ppI and the ppII and ppIII chains\n\nand thus directly influence the high energy neutrino production. 3 He\u22123 He is one of the most energetic reactions\nin the pp-chain along with D-p. Unlike deuterium and\nlithium, 3 He does not reach its equilibrium value on a\nvery short time scale but instead slowly builds up for\ntemperatures less than 8 \u00d7106 K (Clayton 1968). In a solar model, the resulting theoretical 3 He abundance profile\npeaks around r = 0.28R\u2299 with a characteristic bell-like\ncurve due to the competition respectively between its creation and its destruction in the outer and in the inner\nregions of the solar core. At the same time, being one of\nthe most energetic reactions in the pp chains and reaching equilibrium gradually in the outer parts of the nuclear\nregion, this cross section is expected to have an influence\non the thermal structure of the solar core at a level where\nseismic inversions can detect it. Even though the 3 He\u22124 He\nnuclear reaction does not contribute much to the solar energy budget, the fact that it involves both 3 He and 4 He\nchemical elements makes it also an important reaction to\nstudy. The experimental uncertainty of S33 and S34 are\nrespectively \u00b18% and \u00b110% (Adelberger et al. 1998).\n\u2022\nIntermediate screening: We use the intermediate\nscreening prescription of Mitler (1977) in all our models except one that uses the classical weak screening of\nSalpeter (1954). It should be recognised that the screening\nin stellar nuclear reaction rates is a sensitive issue which is\nnot yet completely understood (Dzitko et al. 1995; Wilets\net al. 2000). Depending on the solar thermodynamical conditions and the chemical species interacting in the nuclear\nreaction considered, one has to introduce the adequate\nscreening factor, fsc , coming from the surrounding particles present in the solar plasma which in general differ\nfrom the screening effect evaluated by nuclear physicist in\ntheir experiments. There are thus several sources of uncertainties in evaluating the cross sections and screening\n\n\f6\n\nA.S. Brun et al.: Seismic tests for solar models with tachocline mixing\n\neffects for any given nuclear reaction that we intend to\nconsider in this work.\n\u2022 Opacities, microscopic diffusion and heavy elements\nabundance Z: The structure of solar radiative zone is very\nsensitive to these two physical processes and to the heavy\nelements abundance. These are all closely related since a\nchange in Z leads to a change in the opacity \u03ba and in the\nmicroscopic diffusion, which in turn modify Z as a consequence of the iterative calibration process. The opacity is accurately computed (error \u223c 5%) for temperatures\ngreater than 104 K (Iglesias & Rogers 1996), their main\nsources of uncertainties come from the relative composition and the ionisation degree of the heavy elements as well\nas quantum effects (Rogers & Iglesias 1998). In this work\nwe will leave \u03ba unchanged and will concentrate instead on\nthe heavy elements abundance Z and on the amplitude\nof the microscopic coefficients Di . From a detailed comparison with the work of Turcotte et al. (1998), Brun et\nal. (1998) have confirmed that the analytical expressions\nfor the microscopic diffusion coefficients given by Michaud\n& Proffitt (1993) are accurate enough to deal with the\nsolar case. For the Sun, these uncertainties are at most\n15%. In order to reduce the chemical composition gradient\npresent at the base of the convection zone, which has been\nfound to be too large in model ref compared to the seismically deduced one, we have run one model with Di reduced\nby 10%. The heavy elements abundance of our models\nhas been calibrated to the observed value of Grevesse et\nal. (1996), i.e., (Z/X)ph = 0.0245 (see Table 1). Model\nBtz introduced earlier has been computed with an initial heavy elements abundance Z0 = 0.01959 = Zref that\nleads to (Z/X)s = 0.0255 or 4% higher than (Z/X)ph .\n\u2022 Mixing: It is very tempting to introduce a mild mixing in the nuclear region, for example very close to the\n3\nHe peak, in order to improve the solar model structure\nand to reduce the predicted neutrino fluxes (Haxton 1997,\nBrun et al. 1998). However, the presence of a mixing in the\nsolar core can be rejected on account of the helioseismic\nconstraints, due to the huge disagreement in the central region that it generates (of the order of few % in \u03b4c/c). This\nseismic evidence along with the recent results of the SNO\nneutrino experiment (Ahmad et al. 2001, 2002), strongly\ndisfavour a \"macroscopic mixing\" as the source of the electron neutrino deficit seen on Earth's detectors but instead\nsupport the idea of neutrino flavour oscillations.\nTherefore we limited ourselves to the tachocline region for which we have better evidence for mixing and\na relatively more elaborate physical description available.\nWe used the parameters of model Btz (e.g., d = 0.10R\u2299\nand N /2\u03c0 = 25 \u03bcHz), which have been proven to give a\nreasonable agreement with seismic constraints and light\nelements photospheric abundance (cf. \u00a72.3 and Brun et\nal. 1999). For one case we have assumed a wider mixing zone, i.e., d = 0.15R\u2299 , in order to limit even more\nthe gravitational settling and therefore reduce the steep\ngradients seen in the sound speed, density and composition profile at the base of the convection zone. We have\nalso used the prescription introduced by Elliott & Gough\n\n(1999), namely a constant diffusion coefficient DT E operating over a small domain d = 0.04R\u2299. It is not our\nintention to reevaluate this coefficient, but just to compare both mixing prescriptions.\nHaving introduced all these modifications in our evolution code we derive the profiles of sound speed, density,\nhydrogen abundance and temperature that we discuss in\nthe following subsections.\n\n3.2. Inferred sound speed and density profiles\nWe first consider the relative differences in the sound\nspeed and density between the Sun and our new modified solar models.\n\nFig. 3. The relative difference in sound speed and density\nprofiles between the Sun and solar models as a function\nof fractional radius. Model ref including only microscopic\ndiffusion and the mixed models Btz , N 0 and N (the latter two with increased pp cross section), are represented\nrespectively with solid, short-dashed, dash-dotted and longdashed lines. Superimposed on model ref is the 1\u03c3 error\nenvelope coming from the helioseismic inversion.\n\n3.2.1. Increasing the pp cross section\nIn Fig. 3 we display two new models, N 0 and N , which\ninclude respectively an enhanced pp nuclear cross section\nby 2% and 3.5%, along with the older models ref and Btz\nalready presented in Fig. 1. Clearly the relative differences\nin the sound speed and density between the Sun and model\nN , and to a lesser extent model N 0, are smaller in comparison to model ref and the mixed model Btz . This is\nreally encouraging because contrary to model Btz , both\nmodels N 0 and N have been calibrated to the exact value\nof (Z/X)s = 0.0245 used in model ref. This indicates that\nthe effect of Z via the opacity \u03ba can be compensated by\n\n\fA.S. Brun et al.: Seismic tests for solar models with tachocline mixing\n\n7\n\na small variation of the S11 . Thus a variation of the order\nof a few percent of either the heavy elements abundance\nor the fundamental pp nuclear reaction rate seems to have\nthe same effect on the model sound speed profile in the upper part of the radiative region but not below r = 0.3R\u2299\nwhere contrary to case Btz , model N departs from ref.\nFor the density, a variation of S11 modifies the profile everywhere resulting in a significantly better agreement for\ncase N , at least above r = 0.2R\u2299 . Thus it is very useful\nto assess the accuracy of a model by considering both the\nsound speed and the density profiles, because it allows one\nto distinguish the impact of different physical processes on\nsolar structure. In this particular case an increase of S11\nby 3.5% seems to be favoured by helioseismology, as opposed to an increase of S11 by 2% or of (Z/X)s .\nIt may be noticed that in Fig. 3 the agreement in sound\nspeed inside the convection zone is much better as compared to that for the same models in Fig. 1. This improvement arises because we have scaled the solar radius in the\nmodels by a factor of 1.0003 before forming the difference\nwith the seismically deduced sound speed and density profiles. This scaling of the radius appears to remove most of\nthe discrepancy in the upper convection zone, but does not\naffect the interior. This may be expected since a correction of 0.03% in radial distance is only a small fraction of\nscale height in the interior, while it can become comparable to the scale height in the photospheric layers, resulting\nin significant differences in outer regions. A better agreement with the Sun is also obtained in the outer convective\nzone in the case of a static model (Fig. 1), which assumes\na different treatment of the surface layers. It would appear\nthat uncertainties in treatment of these layers are responsible for the discrepancy in the outer convection zone. In\nstandard solar models the surface is normally defined as\nthe layer where the temperature equals the effective temperature. Because of significant uncertainties in treatment\nof surface layers, the position of the surface may not be\ncorrectly estimated in a solar model. Thus, we believe that\nthe scaling of radius effectively corrects for this error. In\nall subsequent figures we have used this scaled radius when\ncomparing the solar models with profiles inferred from inversions.\n\n3.2.2. Modifying the 3 He-3 He and 3 He-4 He cross\nsections\nWe have just seen that a small change in S11 can significantly improve the agreement between solar models and\nthe seismic Sun when combined with a treatment of the\nsolar tachocline. In the same spirit we have computed a\nsequence of models including modifications of S33 and S34\nnuclear reaction cross sections (cf. \u00a73.1). Models N 1 and\nN 2 share the same tachocline macroscopic treatment, calibration of heavy elements to (Z/X)s = 0.0245 and increase of S11 by 3.5% as model N , but differ by having\nrespectively an increase of S33 by 8% and a decrease of\nS34 by 10% (see Table 2).\n\nFig. 4. The relative difference in sound speed and density\nprofiles between the Sun and solar models as a function\nof fractional radius, showing the effect of modifying the\ncross sections S33 and S34 . The mixed models N , N 1 and\nN 2 are represented respectively with solid, short-dashed\nand long-dashed lines. Superimposed on model N is the\n1\u03c3 error envelope coming from the helioseismic inversion.\nIn Fig. 4 we plot the relative differences in density\nand sound speed between the Sun and models N , N 1 and\nN 2. We first notice that the applied modifications of the\ncross section S33 and S34 improve the core structure both\nin density and sound speed. A variation of S34 by \u221210%\nseems to affect more the very central region than a variation of S33 by +8% does, even if we take into account the\nfact that S33 has been varied by a smaller amount. For\nmodel N 2 the agreement in \u03b4c/c in the core improves by\na factor 2 with respect to model N , whereas for model N 1\nit does only by 20% or so. For \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1, the influence of these\ntwo cross sections is more modest and results in a small\ngradual change of the profile over the solar radius.\nWe now turn to models N 02 and N 03 displayed in Fig.\n5 along with model N 0 as reference. Models N 02 and N 03\nare identical to model N 0 except that they respectively\ninclude a decrease of S34 by 10% and the cumulative opposite variations of the nuclear cross sections S33 by \u22128%\nand S34 by +10% (see Table 2), in order to modify the pp\nbranching ratio such as to increase the high energy neutrino flux. Model N 02 exhibits a better core profile than\nmodel N 0 does by having both relative differences closer\nto zero. However, these two models do not differ from each\nother as much as their counterpart models N and N 2 do\nand are within the 1\u03c3 error bar. In overall the decrease of\nS34 represents in this case a small progress toward a better\nagreement with the seismic data. On the contrary, model\nN 03 that has been computed on purpose with opposite\nvariations of S33 and S34 is almost everywhere in better\nagreement than model N 0 is. Its density profile is signif-\n\n\f8\n\nA.S. Brun et al.: Seismic tests for solar models with tachocline mixing\n\nFig. 5.

The main exception is in the\nvery central part of the solar core, where the \u03b4c/c is quite\noff and the \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1 exhibits a pronouncedly curved shape.\nModel N 03 is an interesting solar model but our variation\nof the S33 and S34 cross sections is certainly too large and\ngoes in the wrong direction for the central parts.\nIn summary, these new sets of results confirm that it\nis possible to improve the overall agreement between the\nmodels and the seismic Sun by modifying, within their uncertainties, the rates of important nuclear reactions such\nas S33 and S34 . Here it appears that the seismic data\nfavour a decrease of S34 and an increase of S33 rather\nthan the opposite.\n\n3.2.3. Nuclear screening\nWe would like now to characterise the influence of the\nnuclear screening on the solar model sound speed and\ndensity profiles. We have therefore changed the screening\nprescription from intermediate to weak (cf. \u00a73.1), on the\ntop of all the modifications already introduced in one\nmodel, that we have chosen to be N 02, and called that\nnew model N 0W . In Fig. 6 we compare results obtained\nfor models N 2, N 02 and N 0W , in order to quantify the\ninfluence of the nuclear screening on the solar core. In the\nvery central part of model N 0W the agreement seems\nto not be as good as in model N 02. The relative sound\nspeed difference profile between the Sun and model N 0W\nfor r < 0.2R\u2299 reaches a value of the same order as model\n\nFig. 6. The relative difference in sound speed and density\nprofiles between the Sun and solar models as a function\nof fractional radius, showing the effect of changing the\nnuclear screening. The mixed models N 2, N 02 and N 0W\nare represented respectively with solid, short-dashed and\nlong-dashed lines. Superimposed on model N 2 is the 1\u03c3\nerror envelope coming from the helioseismic inversion.\nN 0 in Fig. 5 and thus the change of nuclear screening\nseems to compensate the change by 10% in S34 made\nin model N 02. The density profile of model N 0W is in\nbetter agreement with the Sun than model N 02 above 0.3\nR\u2299 . We should be careful in evaluating the effect on the\ncore structure of using a different screening prescription,\nbecause model N 0W includes an increase of S11 (0)\nalready calibrated on the intermediate screening, but the\ninversion seems to indicate that a smaller increase of S11\nis favoured if one has to use a weak nuclear screening\ninstead (cf., Table 3).\n\n3.2.4. Microscopic diffusion\nAs already stated in \u00a73.1, we are interested in a reduction\nof the steep composition gradient at the base of the convection zone, which implies a decrease of the microscopic\ndiffusion coefficients Di . Model N D includes such a decrease by 10% of Di along with other variations identical\nto model N 2. It is obvious from Fig. 7, that a reduction of\nmicroscopic diffusion is not appropriate, since model N D\nsystematically departs more from the seismic Sun in the\nradiation zone than model N 2. It is well known that microscopic diffusion modifies and improves the stratification\nin the radiation zone (Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. 1993).\nBased on the sound speed and density profiles, an increase\nof Di is favoured rather than a decrease as in model N D.\nHowever an increase of Di would make the composition\ngradient at the base of the convective zone even steeper.\n\n\fA.S. Brun et al.: Seismic tests for solar models with tachocline mixing\n\nThus it seems quite unlikely that the microscopic diffusion\nis the remaining source of the discrepancies seen in a solar\nmodel like N 2.\n\n9\n\nmainly because of their overlapping radial resolution, and\nas a consequence Elliott & Gough found that \u223c 0.02R\u2299\nwas large enough to get rid of the bump in \u03b4c/c. It is\nquite puzzling that the introduction of their mixing in our\nevolutionary model does not give at all the same result.\nIndeed model N E is significantly different from models\nN 2 or N M , that we believe are in quite good agreement\nwith the seismic Sun. It can be seen in Fig. 7 that an increase of the extent of the mixing region in model N M\ndoes not affect that much the density and sound speed\nprofiles except for the slight modification close to the base\nof the convection zone. We therefore conclude that not all\nprescriptions for 'tachocline mixing' give the same result\nand that ours is quite efficient in suitably modelling this\ntransition region.\n\n3.3. Hydrogen abundance profile and photospheric\ncomposition\n\nFig. 7. The relative difference in sound speed and density profiles between the Sun and solar models. The\nmixed models N 2, N M , N E and N D are represented respectively with solid, short-dashed, long-dashed and dashdotted lines. Superimposed on model N 2 is the 1\u03c3 error\nenvelope coming from the helioseismic inversion.\n\n3.2.5. Adjusting the tachocline mixing\nIn the sequence of models we have just discussed, we were\nonly concerned with the influences on the solar structure\nof variations in the nuclear and atomic input data. We are\nnow interested in assessing the impact on \u03b4c/c and \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1\nof varying the macroscopic parameters used for the solar\ntachocline. In Fig. 7 we also display models N M and N E\nwhich include the same microscopic ingredients as model\nN 2 but with respectively, a broader mixing region with\nd \u223c 0.15R\u2299 (i.e., tachocline thickness h \u223c 0.075R\u2299) and\nanother macroscopic treatment for the tachocline (Elliott\n& Gough 1999), over a shorter distance h \u223c 0.02R\u2299 (see\nTable 2). We clearly see that model N E does not reduce\nthe bump in \u03b4c/c or the steep gradient in \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1 at the base\nof the convection zone seen in model ref in Fig. 3 as much\nas the two other models N 2 and N M . Even though model\nN E includes the same nuclear cross section modifications,\nit is further away from the seismic Sun. One reason for\nthis poorer agreement is that the tachocline mixing is too\nshallow. The value of 0.02 R\u2299 adopted in model N E for\nthe extent of the mixing has been calibrated by Elliott\n& Gough using a static model of the Sun at the present\nage and by convolving with the inversion kernels afterward. This convolution procedure using the inversion kernels makes the effective thickness of the mixing broader,\n\nWe have so far addressed the question of the influence of\nmixing and microscopic variations on the primary inversion quantities such as the sound speed and the density.\nWe would now like to assess what are the consequences\nof such changes on the profile and photospheric value of\nthe hydrogen abundance Xph . Using the secondary inversion procedure introduced by Antia & Chitre (1998), we\nhave compared the hydrogen abundance profile in the Sun\nwith that predicted by our new set of solar models. By assuming the Z profile of the models we have calculated the\ndifference of X between each model and the Sun.\nIn Fig. 8 we represent the absolute difference in\nhydrogen abundance profile \u03b4X between the solar models\nref, Btz , N 0 and N (cf., Table 2) and the Sun. As with\n\u03b4c/c and \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1 displayed in Fig. 3, it is quite clear that the\nmixed models are closer to the inferred solar hydrogen\nabundance than the purely microscopic model ref is.\nThis improvement occurs mainly close to the base of the\nconvection zone and in the convection zone itself (i.e.,\nindicating a closer photospheric value) as expected by\nthe introduction of our shallow tachocline mixing. The\nreason for such an improvement is twofold:\n\u2022 Firstly, by introducing a macroscopic mixing at the\nbase of the convection zone, we hinder the gravitational\nsettling of the chemical species and as a result there\nare relatively more helium and heavy elements in the\nconvection zone, thus reducing the hydrogen contribution\nin the plasma composition mixture to a value closer to\nthe seismically inferred one.\n\u2022 Secondly, the existence of an extended/mixed plateau\nof the chemical composition due to the presence of a\nmacroscopic mixing at the base of the convection zone is\nin better agreement with the seismically inferred X profile.\nThis result, along with the improved sound speed and\ndensity profiles discussed in the previous subsection, confirms the presence of macroscopic mixing at the base of the\n\n\f10\n\nA.S. Brun et al.: Seismic tests for solar models with tachocline mixing\n\nTable 3. Seismic inference on hydrogen abundance and\nS11\n\nFig. 8. The absolute difference in hydrogen abundance\nprofile between the models and the Sun is shown as a\nfunction of fractional radius. Model ref including only microscopic diffusion and the mixed models Btz N 0 and N\nare represented respectively with solid, short-dashed, dashdotted and long-dashed lines. Superimposed on model ref\nis the 1\u03c3 error envelope coming from the helioseismic inversion.\nconvection zone and the necessity to introduce this process\nin solar models. Figure 8 also reveals that a small increase\nby less than 4% of the cross-section of the fundamental\nnuclear reaction pp is favoured as well. Indeed models N 0\nand N are significantly closer to the inferred hydrogen\nabundance over the whole radiative interior (except for a\nsmall region between 0.35 and 0.5 R\u2299 ) than either of the\ntwo other models shown. Further, Fig. 8 shows that the\nphotospheric hydrogen content of model N (Xph = 0.7333\nsee Table 3) and model N 0 are closer to the seismically\ninferred value of 0.732 \u00b1 0.001 than both models Btz and\nref. Thus the effect of varying the nuclear cross section S11\nis to change the hydrogen surface abundance in the model\nvia the calibration procedure, the maximum amplitude of\nsuch modification being located in the central region, leading to an improvement of the agreement between the Sun\nand model N by at least a factor 2.\nWhile determining the X profile through inversions\nwe also get an estimate of pp reaction cross-section, S11\nthat is required to match the observed solar luminosity.\nTable 3 lists the values obtained by assuming the Z profile\nof each of the models considered in this study. It is clear\nthat this estimate is not sensitive to other properties of\nthe model, except for the treatment of the plasma screening. Beside model N 0W , all other models yields a value\nS11 \u2248 4.06 \u00d7 10\u221225 MeV Barns, which is 1.5% higher than\nthe value given by Adelberger et al. (1998). This is somewhat less than the value given by Antia & Chitre (1999)\nor by Degl'Innocenti et al. (1998).

The seismically deduced pp reaction cross-section S11 for each models is given in unit of 10\u221225\nMeV barns.\n\nto different treatment of the plasma screening in calculating nuclear energy generation rates. If one uses weak,\nintermediate or strong screening for the solar plasma, the\nresulting increase in the pp cross section S11 found by\nseismic inversion will vary respectively between 0.5% and\n4%. Anyway all screening treatments seem to indicate a\nhigher value of S11 than currently calculated by nuclear\nphysicists. However, it appears that with our intermediate\nscreening (e.g., Mitler 1977), an increase of S11 by 3.5%\npushes the value of the pp cross section beyond what is required from seismic constraints, but nevertheless we keep\nthese models as they amplify the effect of increasing S11\nand are in rather good agreement with the primary inversions of the sound speed and density.\nApart from S11 Table 3 also gives the seismically inferred photospheric hydrogen abundance (Xinv ). Again\nthis value is not sensitive to small differences in the Z\nprofile, but is mainly determined by the photospheric Z\nvalue. Thus all models other than Btz give Xinv \u2248 0.732\nwhich is only slightly less than the value in the corresponding solar model (Xph ). Further, this value will yield\nhelium abundance, Y \u2248 0.25, which is also close to the independently inferred value using seismic inversions in the\nconvection zone (Basu 1998, DiMauro et al. 2002). Thus\nthe photospheric helium abundances obtained using different techniques are consistent with each other.\nWe now consider the effect of a variation of the 3 He3\nHe and 3 He-4 He reaction rates on the hydrogen abundance via their influence on the creation and destruction\nof helium in the solar core. In Fig. 9 we display the absolute difference \u03b4X between the mixed models N , N 1 and\nN 2 and the Sun. As we previously did, we prefer to use the\nmixed model N for comparison in this plot, since model N\nis significantly closer to the seismic Sun than model ref is.\nThe absolute differences \u03b4X for the three models shown\nare all very close to zero. We find that as with the sound\n\n\fA.S. Brun et al.: Seismic tests for solar models with tachocline mixing\n\n11\n\nFig. 9.

But for the\nquantity \u03b4X, model N gives a better agreement with the\nSun than models N 1 and N 2.\nIn Fig. 10 we display the difference in hydrogen abundance between the sequence of mixed models N 0, N 02,\nN 03 and N 0W and the Sun. A first small difference with\nthe previous figure is that an increase of pp by +2% does\nnot reduce as much the disagreement with the inferred hydrogen abundance profiles than an increase by 3.5% does.\nAs for model N 2, the hydrogen abundance profile of model\nN 02 is only slightly affected in the inner central part. This\nseems to indicate that the variation of \u221210% of S34 is too\nlarge. Model N 03, with opposite variations of S33 and S34\ncross sections, is shifted downward by \u22120.0005 compared\nto model N 0 over most of the radiative zone and its core\nprofile is way off. All these models confirm the feeling that\nthe effects of the S33 and S34 cross section are mixed, in\nthe sense that in some regions the agreement is improved\nwhile in other regions it becomes worse. Thus it is difficult to conclude if the variation of these cross sections is\njustified basing one's argument on seismic inversion of the\nhydrogen abundance.\nFor model N 0W , computed with a weak nuclear\nscreening instead of intermediate as in model N 02, the\nresult is a very small downward shift of \u03b4X compared to\nmodel N 02, but no significant improvement otherwise. It\nis thus unlikely that the screening effect will correct near\n\nthe solar core the remaining discrepancy seen in the hydrogen abundance profiles obtained in our mixed models.\nFinally in Fig. 11 we display the difference in hydrogen abundance between the solar models and the Sun for\ncases N M and N E that include different macroscopic\nparameters and case N D with reduced microscopic diffusion along with case N 2. For model N D the effect of\nthe microscopic diffusion is subtle to be appreciated because it modifies non uniformly the hydrogen abundance.\nThe model seems to possess the closest hydrogen surface\nabundance Xph = 0.7321 relative to the inferred value\nXinv = 0.7327, and the smallest composition gradient at\nthe base of the convection zone, thus justifying the use of a\nsmaller microscopic diffusion coefficient Di . But the reduction seems overestimated because model N D is the only\nsolar model to exhibit a smaller hydrogen photospheric\nabundance Xph than the seismically inferred one. Further,\ndeeper down in the radiative interior the hydrogen abundance profile departs too much from the inferred profile.\nTherefore, as for the sound speed, a reduction of Di seems\nto be discarded by present helioseismic inversions.\nThe effect of a broader mixing on \u03b4X (i.e., model N M )\nis to reduce the composition gradient and to extend the\nmixed plateau, properties that seem to be in better agreement with the inferred X profile. Moreover, Xph is closer\nto Xinv in models N M and N D than for example model\nN 2. Deeper down the improvement is not as obvious and\nconsidering the fact that the extent of the tachocline mixing is certainly over estimated in this model, we can hardly\nconclude that it constitutes a better solution than, say,\nmodels N or N 2. Model N E is clearly worse in X as well\n\n\f12\n\nA.S. Brun et al.: Seismic tests for solar models with tachocline mixing\n\nFig. 11. The absolute difference in hydrogen abundance\nprofile between solar models and the Sun as a function of\nfractional radius. The mixed models N 2, N E, N M and\nN D are represented respectively with solid, short-dashed,\nlong-dashed, and dot-dashed lines. Superimposed on model\nN 2 is the 1\u03c3 error envelope coming from the helioseismic\ninversion.\nas in \u03b4c/c and \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1 compared to other mixed models.\nWhereas its profile deep in the radiative interior is in reasonable agreement with the seismically inferred one, while\nit is clearly not the case for the upper part (r > 0.6R\u2299 ).\nThe resulting composition gradient is too steep and the\nhydrogen abundance in the convective envelope too high.\nTo summarise our findings about the hydrogen abundance profile, it can be stated that 'tachocline mixing'\nis very likely to occur in the Sun, and that an increase\nof S11 is clearly favoured by current helioseismic data,\nwith an amplitude of the order of a few %. Less obvious are the effects of the two others dominant nuclear\ncross sections, i.e., S33 and S34 , although they can lead\nto some improvement as well. On the other side, neither\nthe microscopic diffusion nor the screening effect seem to\ncause significant changes. However, the screening prescription has been found to modify significantly the value of\nthe cross section of the pp nuclear reaction inferred by\nseismic inversion. Our last two models N E and N M including variations of the macroscopic parameters are not\nfavoured by our study, because with model N E, the mixing is too shallow and does not vary with time and with\nmodel N M the mixing is too broad. We thus find that\nthe seismically inferred photospheric hydrogen abundance\nis Xinv = 0.732 \u00b1 0.001, but the value change quite a bit\ndepending on the value of heavy elements abundance assumed.\nWe would like now to briefly discuss the new photospheric composition obtained by our models at the solar age, with particular emphasis on light elements deple-\n\ntion. As already stressed, the mixed models exhibit a better overall chemical composition, say compared to models\nwith only microscopic mixing such as ref. One chemical\nelement, namely the lithium, is crucial to assess the efficiency and time dependence of macroscopic mixing. With\nthe presence of an effective macroscopic mixing at the base\nof the convection zone, all the models presented in this\nstudy are expected to deplete a fair amount of 7 Li. All\nmodels, except N E, burn indeed a substantial quantity of\n7\nLi both in the PMS and in the main sequence phases, thus\nreaching a photospheric abundance at the solar age, Lis ,\nsignificantly smaller than the initial/meteoritic value, Li0 ,\ni.e., Li0 /Lis \u223c 130 \u2212 180, in reasonable agreement with\nthe observations of Grevesse et al. (1996), Li0 /Lis \u223c 140.\nModel N E depletes a large amount of lithium as well\n(Li0 /Lis \u223c 100), but most of it (\u223c 90%) in the PMS\nphase, which is not realistic when compared with open\ncluster observations. This comes about because the macroscopic coefficient DT E used in this model, following Elliott\n& Gough treatment of the tachocline, does not include any\ntime dependence. Brun et al. (1999) have demonstrated\nthat a proper time dependence of DT causes significant\nlithium burning along the main sequence as well. Another\nimportant constraint is provided by the beryllium abundance, which requires that the mixing must be shallow in\norder not to destroy this element by more than 10% (see\nBrun et al. 1999; Bell, Balachandran & Bautista 2001).\nWith either of the two diffusion coefficients used in this\nstudy, DT or DT E , we easily achieve this goal, i.e., all the\nmodels but one deplete 9 Be by less than 10%. Model N M ,\nwhich has been computed with the broadest tachocline\nmixing (i.e., h = 0.075R\u2299), leads to an underabundance of\n9\nBe of 20%, thus confirming that in this model the mixing\nextends too deep inside the radiative zone. We interpret\nthis result as an indication that the tachocline mixing can\nnot be broader than 5% in solar radius. Thus using this upper limit for the tachocline extent, we are quite confident\nabout the efficiency of our macroscopic time dependent\ncoefficient DT (r, t) to model the tachocline region and to\nlead not only to the proper photospheric composition at\nthe solar age but also in the earlier phases. However, as\nalready stated with model Btz , with our prescription the\nlithium depletion is still too big in the PMS, even though\nit is reasonably distributed over the whole temporal evolution compared, say, to model N E.\n\n3.4. Temperature profile and neutrino production\nIt has been known for more than thirty years that standard solar models and neutrino experiments on Earth disagree on the amount of neutrinos produced in the thermonuclear core of the Sun, the former predicting always a\nflux in excess (Bahcall 1989). A number of ingenious suggestions have been given to either explain the discrepancy\nfrom revised and 'non-standard' solar models or by invoking neutrino flavour oscillations from the electron neutrino \u03bde , generated in the pp chains and CNO cycles, to\n\n\fA.S. Brun et al.: Seismic tests for solar models with tachocline mixing\n\nits siblings the muon \u03bd\u03bc and tau \u03bd\u03c4 neutrinos or to the socalled 'sterile neutrino' (Haxton 1995; Bahcall, Krastev\n& Smirnov 1998b). Here we intend to use the seismic diagnosis to constrain as much as possible the theoretical\nneutrino flux, which is very sensitive to the central temperature.\nFigure 12 represents the relative temperature difference between solar models ref, Btz , N , N 0, N 02 and N 03\nand the Sun. The overall agreement of the six models is\nquite satisfactory, with model ref being the least accurate\nin the tachocline region as expected.\n\n13\n\nclear cross sections S33 and S34 . Effectively, it seems that\nfor the temperature profile, the decrease of S34 by 10%,\nas in model N 02, does not lead to any progress in the\ncentral part while an increase does. This conclusion is at\nodd with what we learnt from the sound speed inversion.\nThis could mean that either the secondary inversion of the\ntemperature is not as reliable as the sound speed (that is\nin part true but unsatisfactory) or that the temperature\nvaries differently with modifications of the main physical\ningredients than the sound speed does, due for example\nto a compensatory change of the central composition. So,\nwe have to be cautious in our conclusions regarding the\nvery central part since this is the region where the inversions are the least reliable. Nevertheless, we still consider\nthat for the temperature profile models ref, Btz , N 0, N 03\nand more marginally, model N , all represent seismically\nacceptable solutions of the solar core. As a result, what\none can expect to be the impact on the neutrino fluxes of\nsuch diverse temperature profiles?\nTable 4. Neutrino Fluxes at Earth\n\nFig. 12. The relative temperature difference between solar models ref, Btz , N , N 0, N 02 and N 03 and the Sun.\nNote the somewhat larger uncertainties for this variable\nin the neutrino production region (r < 0.3R\u2299 ) compared\nfor example to the sound speed ones.\nWe can indeed notice that the introduction of a macroscopic mixing in the tachocline improves the profile of all\nthe models by at least a factor 2 above r = 0.6R\u2299 , over\nmodel ref, thus confirming the importance of taking into\naccount the mixing present in this transition region. In\nthe bulk of the radiative zone, some improvement comes\nfrom the increase of the pp cross section and results in\na flattening of \u03b4T /T and a slightly closer agreement with\nthe Sun. For the very central part, where the neutrinos are\nproduced, the secondary seismic inversion of the temperature is less accurate with an error bar of \u00b12 \u00d7 10\u22123 , and\nthus does not constrain the solar models as much. Models\nref and Btz are surprisingly good there. Model N is quite\nsatisfying except in this very central part. This can be\ninterpreted as an excessive increase of the pp cross section. Models N 0 and N 03 seem to be our best models in\nthe range [0,0.7] R\u2299 . While this could have been expected\nfrom model N 0, based on the inversion of the sound speed\nand density profiles (\u00a73.2), it was not so for model N 03\nthat has been computed with opposite variation of the nu-\n\nModels\nRef\nBtz\nN0\nN 03\nN 0W\nN\nN1\nN2\nND\n\n71\n\nGa\n127.1\n127.1\n123.7\n128.2\n121.4\n122.5\n121.3\n119.3\n118.7\n\nDetector\n37\nCl Water\n7.04\n4.99\n7.04\n4.99\n6.41\n4.48\n7.08\n4.99\n6.10\n4.25\n6.18\n4.29\n6.0\n4.16\n5.7\n3.93\n5.59\n3.85\n\nNote: The 71 Ga, 37 Cl and Water columns correspond respectively to the predicted solar neutrinos fluxes for the Gallium,\nChlorine and Water experiments (cf., Table 1). The gallium\nand chlorine neutrino fluxes are given in SNU whereas the water (SNO/SuperKamiokande) ones are in 106 cm\u22122 s\u22121 .\n\nTo answer that question we have summarised in Table\n4 the neutrinos fluxes of the most significant models. By\ncomparing for example models ref and N 2, we find that\nfor the latter the Gallium flux is reduced by 8 SNU, the\nChlorine by 1.34 SNU and the 8 B by 106 cm\u22122 s\u22121 down\nto 3.93\u00d7106 cm\u22122 s\u22121 . Such theoretical fluxes are still too\nhigh compared to the neutrino experiment on Earth (cf.,\nTable 1), if no other modifications are introduced either in\nthe model or in the quantum properties of the neutrinos.\nFor example, the production of the 8 B neutrinos is directly\nsensitive to the p-7 Be nuclear cross section. The value used\nin this study is S17 (0) = 19.1+4\n\u22122 eV barns (Adelberger et\nal. 1998), and corresponds to an intermediate value compared to the recent estimate of Davids et al. (2001) (i.e.,\nS17 (0) = 17.8+1.4\n\u22121.2 eV barns) or of Junghans et al. (2002)\n(i.e., S17 (0) = 22.3 \u00b1 0.7 \u00b1 0.5 eV barns). Thus we can\nconservatively consider that the error bar in S17 nuclear\ncross section is at least of the order of \u00b110%. Such an un-\n\n\f14\n\nA.S. Brun et al.: Seismic tests for solar models with tachocline mixing\n\ncertainty, results in an increase or decrease of our 8 B flux\nby \u00b110% as well.\nBy taking into account most of the uncertainties\npresent in a solar model to calculate the neutrino fluxes,\nsuch as the nuclear reactions cross sections, the screening,\nthe heavy elements abundance, the absorption cross\nsections for Gallium and Chlorine experiments, the\namount of microscopic and macroscopic diffusion, etc.\n(see Turck-Chi\u00e8ze et al. 2001), we end up with the following fluxes (errors have been obtained by quadratic sum of\nthe individual contributions assumed to be independent):\n71\n\nGa= 123.7 \u00b1 8.7 SNU,\nCl= 6.41 \u00b1 0.86 SNU and\nWater= (4.48 \u00b1 0.71) \u00d7 106 cm\u22122 s\u22121 .\n\n37\n\nThese values are a bit lower than Bahcall et al. (2001)\nand Turck-Chi\u00e8ze et al. (2001), but remain within the\n1\u03c3 error range. However, they are still significantly larger\nthan the observations, unless one invokes non standard\nneutrino properties. Such evidence for neutrino flavour oscillation have been recently given by Ahmad et al. (2001)\nbased on the careful study of the high energy neutrino fluxes detected by the SNO detector and by the\nSuperKamiokande experiments (Fukuda et al. 1998). Since\nthen SNO has also measured the 8 B neutrino flux using\nthe neutral current channel, which is equally sensitive to\nall neutrino flavours (Ahmad et al. 2002). The resulting\n8\nB flux, is found to be (5.09 \u00b1 0.62) \u00d7 106 cm\u22122 s\u22121 , which\nis within the error bars of the current solar neutrino prediction. Our helioseismic study seems to favour more the\nlower range of the detection than the upper range.\n\n4. Discussion and conclusions\nIn this work our goal was to assess the effect of uncertainties in nuclear reaction rates, atomic data and diffusion\ncoefficients on solar models, which we have compared with\nthe results of helioseismic inversions. We have concluded in\n\u00a73 that a variation of the nuclear reaction rates can have a\nsignificant impact on the solar structure and that current\nmodelling coupled with seismic data favours some change\nof the accepted central value of three important nuclear\nreaction rates, pp, 3 He-3 He and 3 He-4 He. While the pp reaction rates needs to be increased by about 1.5% over the\ncurrently accepted value from Adelberger et al. (1998), the\nconstraints on other reaction rates are less clear. Even the\nincrease of pp rate involved in this study is less than that\ninferred by Antia & Chitre (1999) and Degl'Innocenti et\nal. (1998) and the difference can be attributed to different\ntreatment of nuclear energy generation in CESAM as compared to the version of Bahcall's energy routine used in\nearlier estimates. More precisely, most of the discrepancy\ncomes from the different screening prescriptions used. In\nthe previous study of Antia & Chitre (1999), the screening formulation of Graboske et al. (1973) was assumed as\nopposed to Salpeter (1954) or Mitler (1977) in this new\nstudy. We refer to Dzitko et al. (1995) and Wilets et al.\n\n(2000) for a detailed comparison of several weak, intermediate and strong, screening prescriptions.\nOur work confirms the result of Brun et al. (1999)\nthat the implementation of macroscopic mixing in the\ntachocline improves the agreement between solar models and seismic Sun (\u00a73.2). In particular, direct comparison of hydrogen abundance profiles between our models and the Sun as inferred from seismic inversions has\ndemonstrated that the models with tachocline mixing are\nin much better agreement with the Sun in tachocline region. Comparison of hydrogen abundance profile in solar\nmodels with inferred profiles show that there is still a discrepancy of about 0.003 (\u00a73.3). The largest discrepancies\noccur in the region close to the tachocline and at about\nr = 0.2R\u2299 , where the sound speed also shows maximum\ndiscrepancy. Thus it appears that there is still some scope\nfor improving the formulation for calculating the mixing\nin tachocline region. We were not able to achieve any significant improvement compared to the results of Brun et\nal. (1999) by adjusting the parameters of the tachocline\nmodel. With some modifications the agreement improves\nin the tachocline region, like in model N M , but it tends to\nworsen in other places. We have found as well that based\non the 9 Be photospheric depletion, the maximum extent\nof the mixing in the tachocline is 5% of solar radius. It\nis quite possible that a major part of the remaining discrepancies (about 0.1% in sound speed, 1% in density and\n0.003 in X) in our improved models may be due to uncertainties in input physics, like the opacities or equation of\nstate.\nComparing the surface hydrogen abundance in solar\nmodels and those obtained by inversions (Table 3) with\nthe abundance inferred directly from seismic data (Basu\n1998), we again find a difference of 0.001. This suggests\nthat discrepancies of this order are present in the input physics which is used in inferring these independent\nmeasurements of surface hydrogen abundance. The helium abundance drawn from the structure of the ionisation zones is particularly sensitive to the equation of state\n(Basu & Antia 1995), while its abundance inferred from\nthe solar models depends on the whole input physics used\nin constructing those. Similarly, the seismically inferred\nhydrogen abundance profile is sensitive to opacity as well\nas to the Z profile used in inversion. Thus the discrepancy\nbetween these three independent estimates of surface hydrogen abundance probably gives an estimate of errors in\ninput physics. The difference between solar models with\ntachocline mixing and seismically inferred profiles is of the\nsame order and could be due also to remaining uncertainties in input physics.\nAs seen in Fig. 1 the evolutionary solar models show\na significant departure from seismic inferences inside the\nconvection zone. We find that scaling the radius of these\nmodels by 1.0003 before taking the differences with inverted profile removes most of the discrepancy in the convection zone. We believe that this is due to uncertainties in\nthe treatment of surface layers. In the solar models the surface is defined by the layer where the temperature equals\n\n\fA.S. Brun et al.: Seismic tests for solar models with tachocline mixing\n\neffective temperature and it is quite possible that because\nof uncertainties in surface layers the location of this point\nhas an error of about 200 km in our evolutionary models.\nWe would like to point out that adjusting the solar radius\nin the model by 200 km does not remove this discrepancy,\nsince even in the new model the position of the surface\nhas the same uncertainty. Thus this scaling of radius has\nno relation to uncertainty in solar radius itself.\nThe calculated neutrino fluxes in solar models with\ntachocline mixing are found to be somewhat lower than\nthose in standard solar model of Bahcall et al. (2001), but\nwithin the 1\u03c3 error limits (\u00a73.4). The main reason for reduction is the increase in pp reaction rate, which reduces\nthe central temperature required to generate the solar luminosity. Recently, using both the charged and neutral\ncurrent channels, SNO has measured the total 8 B neutrino\nflux of 5.09 \u00d7 106 cm\u22122 s\u22121 (Ahmad et al. 2002). This is\nsomewhat larger than the value we find in our models. In\nthe modified models N 1, N 2 the neutrino fluxes are much\nlower, because we have chosen to modify the nuclear reaction rates to reduce these fluxes. If instead as with model\nN 03 we had modified S33 and S34 in opposite directions\nthe neutrino fluxes would have increased and it would be\npossible to get values close to that inferred by Ahmad et\nal. (2002). Also our increase of pp reaction rate by 3.5%\nin some of these models is probably an overestimate, since\nseismic models with same input physics appear to need\nan increase by only 1.5% to produce the required solar\nluminosity. When almost all the sources of uncertainties\nare taken into account in evaluating the theoretical neutrino fluxes, our result is within 1\u03c3 of the other published\ntheoretical neutrino fluxes and the recent SNO compilation. It will be interesting in the near future, when the\nSNO collaboration results will have been integrated over\na longer time to see if the helioseismic tool will be able\nto constrain even more efficiently the main nuclear cross\nsections, via a careful analysis of the neutrino spectrum,\nand also delineate the parameter space for mass-squared\ndifference-mixing angle plane.\nAcknowledgements.
