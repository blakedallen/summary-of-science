We\npresent a fast and general method for marginalization over calibration-type errors by analytical integration. This is worked through for the specific example of CMB calibration and beam\nuncertainties and the resulting formulae are practical to implement. We show how cosmological parameter constraints from the latest CMB data are changed when calibration/beam\nuncertainties are taken into account: typically the best fit parameters are shifted and the errors\nbars are increased by up to fifty per cent for e.g. ns and \u03a9b h2 ; although as expected there is\nno change for \u03a9K , because it is constrained by the positions of the peaks.\nKey words: cosmology:observations \u2013 cosmology:theory \u2013 cosmic microwave background\n\u2013 methods:statistical\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\nFluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation\non scales of fractions of a degree and larger are potentially a direct\nprobe of the state of the universe 300,000 years after the big bang,\nmodified by the geometry of the universe. If the initial fluctuations\nwere Gaussian and structure formed by gravitational collapse then\nthe angular power spectrum of the CMB contains much cosmological information, and is also easy to calculate using codes CMBFAST (Seljak & Zaldarriaga 1999) and CAMB (Lewis, Challinor &\nLasenby 1999). Therefore many experiments have been carried out\nto estimate its form, and the results from the second generation of\nCMB telescopes are eclipsing previous results. Recent work involving parameter estimation from the CMB includes Wang, Tegmark\n& Zaldarriaga (2001), Netterfield el (2001), de Bernardis et al.\n(2001), Pryke et al. (2001), Stompor et al. (2001), Jaffe et al.\n(2001), Bridle et al. (2001), Kinney, Melchiorri & Riotto (2001), Le\nDour et al. (2000), Lahav et al. (2000), Dodelson & Knox (2000),\nMelchiorri et al. (2000), Efstathiou (2000), Gawiser & Silk (1998)\nand Lineweaver (1998).\nCMB power spectrum results have significant calibration uncertainties, due either to uncertainty in the flux of the calibration\nsource (e.g. Jupiter) or difficulties in its measurement by the experiment in question (e.g. a scan synchronous noise in measurements\nof the CMB dipole) or both. As a result the band power \u2206T or \u2206T 2\nestimates from any single experiment can be scaled up or down by\nc 2001 RAS\n\nsome unknown factor. This calibration uncertainty is now of greater\nsignificance because of the increased precision of experiments: it is\nnow of a similar size to the quoted random errors. In addition, because of the correlations in errors that it introduces, the calibration\nuncertainty is not simple to take into consideration when extracting cosmological parameters from a CMB power spectrum. This\ncontrasts with the case of a calibration uncertainty on a single data\npoint, which can be approximately taken into account by adding\nthe calibration uncertainty in quadrature with the random errors.\nA fast method in the literature for dealing with this uncertainty\ncouples the marginalization over the calibration with that over the\nCMB power spectrum normalization (Ganga et al. 1997, Lange et\nal. 2001). However, this is non-trivial to extend to the case where\nseveral CMB data sets have independent and significant calibration\nuncertainties (\u223c 20 per cent in dT 2 for BOOMERANG, Netterfield et al. 2001, and \u223c 8 per cent for MAXIMA-1, Lee et al. 2001,\nand DASI, Halverson et al 2001). Wang et al. (2001) account for\nthe calibration uncertainty by using a method related to that presented here, however the derivation is not well documented in the\nliterature. Frequently the marginalisation is carried out numerically,\nwhich is time consuming. Here we present the full derivation of a\nfast method, in which the calibration correction for a single data set\nis marginalised over analytically. This takes no more computation\ntime than when the calibration uncertainty is ignored.\nIn addition to a calibration uncertainty, the experiments such\n\n\f2\n\nS.L. Bridle et al.\n\nas BOOMERANG and MAXIMA suffer from beam uncertainties.\nMany systematics can produce an uncertainty in the reconstruction of the instrumental beam. For example, in the case of the\nBOOMERANG experiment the main contribution to the beam uncertainty is due to the pointing uncertainty. Pointing uncertainty\nleads to beam type uncertainties because temperature measurements are not made continually, but instead are averaged over some\ndiscrete time period. High frequency jitter in the pointing means\nthat each discrete measurement includes pointings over a region of\nthe sky. The effective beam of an experiment reflects the area of\nthe sky being sampled in a given time step, so the true beam must\nbe convolved with the area sampled in a given time step. Thus,\njitter translates into a larger effective beam and uncertainty in the\namount of jitter can be treated as uncertainty in the effective beam\nsize. The impact on the CMB power spectrum is to introduce an\n'angular-scale-dependent' error. For conciseness in the rest of this\npaper, we refer to the combined effects of pointing and beam uncertainties simply as beam uncertainty.\nTo include both calibration and beam uncertainties is computationally costly. In general the beam uncertainty is integrated\nover numerically, thus the computation time is increased by a factor\nequal to the number of integration steps used. In this paper we show\nhow an 'angular-scale-dependent' uncertainty such as the beam error can be marginalised over analytically assuming a Gaussian prior\non the size of the correction. The combined analytic calibration and\nbeam marginalisation takes two to three times as long to calculate\nas when there are no such uncertainties, and has already been used\nin Lahav et al. (2001) and Bean et al. (2001).\nThis method follows the general approach of marginalizing\nover nuisance parameters analytically discussed, for example, in\nGull (1989), Sivia (1996) and Lahav et al. (2000). As discussed\nin this introduction, this work is motivated by the recent CMB\ndata sets. However, the fast marginalisation over a calibration type\nparameter should be much more widely applicable in astronomy.\nTherefore in Section 2 we show the analytic marginalised result\nfor the general case of a correlated beam uncertainty, reserving\nthe mathematical derivation for the Appendix. Section 3 gives fast\ncomputational versions of the formulae for the special cases of\nCMB calibration alone and CMB calibration and beam uncertainties. In Section 4 we illustrate the effect of the marginalisation by\napplying them to the latest CMB data.\n\n2 ANALYTIC MARGINALIZATION\n2.1 General approach\nBefore addressing the specific problems of marginalizing over calibration and beam uncertainties, let us examine the more general\nproblem of 'nuisance' parameters. Quite often, observational results will depend on parameters of the measurement which are not\nprecisely known and whose value is not of great interest to us. In\nsuch cases, it is useful to determine a likelihood function which\nfolds in the effects of the uncertainties in these nuisance parameters by marginalizing over their possible values. The resulting likelihood no longer directly depends on the nuisance parameter, but\nits uncertainties become incorporated in the modified data and its\ncorrelation matrix.\nIn many problems, we can model the observational data, xo ,\nby the predictions from an underlying theory, xp , with a correction\narising from some uninteresting (for the present purposes) nuisance\nparameter b. Thus, the predictions are modified in some way which\n\ndepends on how the nuisance parameter affects the observations.\nAs described below, we can model these corrections by a factor\nlinear in the parameter times some 'template' xb , so the predictions\nfor the full observations are\nxp\u2032\n\n=\n\nxp + bxb .\n\n(1)\n\nxb\n\nHere, the vector\nis assumed to be an arbitrary function of the\npredictions, but not to depend on the data or its noise correlation\nmatrix. The parameter b can be thought of as a measure of how far\nthe nuisance parameter deviates from its expected mean value.\nAs an example consider the calibration uncertainty on the\nCMB temperature angular power spectrum. In this case the xo and\nxp are the observed and predicted \u2206T 2 bandpower measurements.\nThe predictions could be scaled up and down by a factor around 1\ntherefore xb = xp .\nIf the observations are subject to some noise drawn from a\nmultivariate Gaussian distribution with correlation matrix N , then\nthe probability of the data given a model (the model's likelihood)\nis given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0001T\n\u0001\n1\nPr(xo |N, xp , A , b) = NN exp \u2212 xo \u2212 xp\u2032 N \u22121 xo \u2212 xp\u2032 (2)\n.\n2\n\nwhere NN = (2\u03c0)\u2212n/2 |N |\u22121/2 and n is the number of data points.\n(See the start of Section 3 for a discussion about the validity of\nthe Gaussian assumption for CMB band power measurements.) To\nobtain the likelihood of the data independent of the calibration type\nerrors, we must marginalise over b\nPr(xo |N , xp , xb , \u03c3b )\n\n=\n=\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nPr(xo , b |N , xp , xb , \u03c3b ) db\n\n(3)\n\nPr(xo |N , xp , xb , b) Pr(b|\u03c3b ) db, (4)\n\nusing Bayes theorem and assuming P(b |N , xp , xb , \u03c3b ) = P(b|\u03c3b ).\nIt is not always clear what form the prior on the calibration\nparameter b should take. However, if this prior has a simple form,\nthen this marginalisation can often be performed analytically. Here,\nwe assume the prior is a Gaussian of width \u03c3b ,\ni\nh\n1\n2\n2\n.\n(5)\nexp\n\u2212b\n/2\u03c3\nP(b|\u03c3b ) =\nb\n(2\u03c0)1/2 \u03c3b\nIf we were to instead assume a top hat prior on b then the analytic\nmarginalisation can still be carried out, but leads to error functions,\nand is thus more complicated to implement.\nSubstituting Eq. 2 and Eq. 5 into Eq. 4, gathering up terms\nin powers of b, completing the square and integrating over b (see\nAppendix), one finds\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\nPr(xo |N , xp , xb , \u03c3b ) = NM exp \u2212 (xo \u2212 xp )T M \u22121 (xo \u2212 xp ) (6)\n2\nT\n\nM \u22121\n\n=\n\nN \u22121 \u2212\n\nN \u22121 xb xb N \u22121\n.\nT\nxb N \u22121 xb + \u03c3\u22122\nb\n\n(7)\n\nIt is straightforward to show that\nT\n\nM = N + \u03c32b xb xb ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhich is the Sherman-Morrison result (see e.g. Press et al. 1992).\nNote that Eq. 6, 7 is an exact result, and does not, for example, rely\non a Taylor expansion. This calculation looks almost the same as\nwhen the nuisance parameters are not taken into account (xp\u2032 = xp\nEq. 2), except that the matrix N has been replaced by the matrix\nM , which could be a function of the predicted data xp . Note that,\nc 2001 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20136\n\n\fAnalytic marginalization over CMB calibration and beam uncertainty\neven in the case where correlated errors between data points are assumed to be negligible, i.e. N \u22121 is diagonal, the new matrix M \u22121\nis not diagonal. The marginalization effectively introduces a correlated error between the data points, adding error to the collective\nmodes which are affected by the nuisance parameter.\nThis technique has a broad array of applications in the various stages of CMB analysis, from map making to foreground removal (see e.g. Bond & Crittenden, 2001). For example, it is used\nto remove the effects of foreground contaminants from maps such\nas the galaxy. In previous applications, however, the templates removed were independent of the theory, so that the correction to the\nnoise matrix must be done only once. However, in problems such as\ncalibration marginalization, the templates depend on the theoretical\npredictions, so the effective weight matrix must be re-evaluated for\neach theory. As we show below, however, this does not significantly\nslow down the evaluation of the likelihoods.\nNothing in the above is specific to the CMB, so in fact it could\nalso be used a variety of applications, such as the uncertain normalisation of the matter power spectrum resulting from Lyman\u2212\u03b1\nforest measurements (e.g. Croft et al. 2001).\n\n3\n\nquadrupoles, by modifying the noise correlation matrix using the\nWoodbury formula (Bond, Jaffe & Knox 1998).\n\n3 PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION\nIn this Section, the above equations are rewritten in a more computationally practical way for the specific case of CMB calibration\nand beam uncertainties in power spectrum measurements.\nThe analytic technique described above assumes that the observed data are Gaussianly distributed. This is clearly only an approximation for band power measurements, as the power spectrum\nmust be positive. When there are only a few modes in a band power\nmeasurement, a better approximation is to assume a log-normal\nprobability distribution (Bond, Jaffe & Knox, 2000). However, if\nthere are sufficiently many modes and the error bars are significantly smaller than the measured band powers, then the Gaussian approximation should be reasonable and the techniques we\ndescribe can be applied.\n3.1 Calibration Uncertainty\n\n2.2 Marginalization over multiple parameters\nOften there are several nuisance parameters which must be\nmarginalised over simultaneously. The above process can be repeated several times, building up more complicated matrices M .\nAs an example, the CMB bandpower measurements are often subject to both calibration and beam uncertainties which must be\nmarginalised over. (The result for CMB calibration and beam uncertainties is given in the following Section.) This may also be\noccur where there are several experiments each with internal and\ncorrelated external calibration uncertainties, as discussed in Knox\n& Page (2000), and Tegmark & Zaldarriaga (2001). One can expand this set even further, including some simple cosmological parameters. In particular, the overall theory normalization can be performed in the same way.\nWhen applying this technique to the marginalization over\nmany non-orthogonal parameters simultaneously, it can be useful\nto use the block form of the above result. The Woodbury formula\n(also Press et al. 1992) can be used\n(N + XX T )\u22121 = N \u22121 \u2212 [N \u22121 X(1 + X T N \u22121 X)\u22121 X T N \u22121 ], (9)\nwhere X is a m \u00d7 n matrix containing m templates of n elements\neach. Note that this requires only the inversion of a m \u00d7 m matrix,\nwhere m is the number of parameters being marginalised over. This\nformula can be much easier to implement than repeated application\nof the Sherman-Morrison result once the number of parameters being integrated over exceeds two.\nIn the case where more than one variable is marginalised over,\nthe corresponding normalization factor generalizes to,\nh\ni\u22121/2\n.\n(10)\nNM = NN det(1 + X T N \u22121 X)\nAgain, this only requires the evaluation of the determinant of an\nm \u00d7 m matrix, which is computationally inexpensive especially\ngiven that this matrix must already be inverted. While sometimes\nthis normalization factor can be ignored as an overall prefactor, it\ncannot be dropped when the the templates are theory dependent.\nThese techniques have been used in the analysis of the COBE\ndata, where there was the possibility that the data were contaminated by a quadrupole of unknown amplitude. This was accounted for by marginalisation over the possible amplitude of the\nc 2001 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20136\n\nFirst we consider the case of a calibration uncertainty in the CMB\ntemperature anisotropy angular power spectrum. The data xo are\nthe CMB \u2206T 2 bandpower measurements and the xp are the predicted bandpowers. In the case of a calibration uncertainty, the predictions are those expected from the underlying model, multiplied\nby some unknown factor, c which is the potentially incorrect experimental calibration, thus the predictions become xp\u2032 = cxp . For\nexample, BOOMERANG has a calibration uncertainty of 20 per\ncent in \u2206T 2 and therefore c ranges from roughly 0.8 to 1.2.\nThe calibration marginalization is identical to the general case\ndiscussed above if we take b = c \u2212 1 and xb = xp . For clarity in\nthe following subsections we will write the calibration uncertainty\nas \u03c3c , but it can be identified with \u03c3b , since b and c have identical\ndistributions (though they are about a different mean.) Therefore\n\nM = N + \u03c32c xp xpT .\n\n(11)\n\nNote that since the the power spectrum measurements, and therefore c, are positive, we must have \u03c3c \u226a 1 for the Gaussian prior for\nthe calibration to be a reasonable approximation.\nNote that this is identical to the formulation used in Wang et\nal. (2001) except that they use the approximation that the theory xp\nis nearly equal to the data xo to make a theory independent correction to the noise matrix. This is performed just once rather than for\neach theory, making it as fast as if the calibration uncertainty was\nignored. Formally, this is almost equivalent to applying the calibration correction to the data, but not their error bars. In practical\nterms we find that using xo instead of xp makes a shift of a few per\ncent in estimated parameter values. (The same remarks apply to the\nbeam marginalisation in the following subsections.)\nIf we instead attempt to use the exact expression of Eq. 11\nthen, because the matrix M (or more importantly, its inverse) is\na function of the predicted quantities, xp , it must be re-calculated\nfor each underlying model and this can be very time consuming.\n(Not necessarily as time consuming as evaluating the predictions\nfor a given theory, but here we assume these are already known.)\nFor the simple calibration uncertainty case, a fast computational\nimplementation is to calculate in advance the quantities\nvo\nsoo\n\nN \u22121 xo\n= xoT N \u22121 xo .\n=\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\n\f4\n\nS.L. Bridle et al.\n\nThen, dropping terms which are independent of the model predictions, the effective chi-squared defined by\nh\ni\nPr(xo |N , xp ) \u221d exp \u2212\u03c72c /2\n(14)\n\nis given by\n\u03c72c\n\n=\n\nsoo \u2212 2spo + spp \u2212 (spo \u2212 spp )2 /sc + log(sc \u03c32c )\n\n(15)\n\npT\n\nspo\n\n=\n\nx v1\n\n(16)\n\nspp\n\n=\n\n(17)\n\nsc\n\n=\n\nxpT N \u22121 xp\n1\nspp + 2 .\n\u03c3c\n\n(18)\n\nIf the covariance matrix is not diagonal, the matrix product,\nEq. 17, scales as n2 and this dominates the time required to calculate \u03c72 . If the covariance matrix is diagonal, the matrix product\nand the vector products are both linear in n and take comparable\namounts of time. In either case however, the effects of marginalizing over the calibration (the last two terms in Eq. 15) use the same\nfactors required to calculate the naive \u03c72 , so this process takes no\nmore computation time.\n\n3.2 Beam Uncertainty\nMeasurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation angular power spectrum are often hampered by an uncertainty in the\ntelescope beam. This leads to correlated errors in the estimates of\npower spectrum analogous to those of the calibration uncertainty,\nwith the added complication that the corrections grow as the angular scale becomes smaller. Marginalizing over these can be performed in the same way, but now xb = A xp , where A is a diagonal matrix which increases for higher multipole band powers. The\nprecise nature of this matrix depends on the nature of the beam\nshape and 'jitter' uncertainties, and is best estimated by the experimental teams. For example, the BOOMERANG and MAXIMA\nteams give 1 \u2212 \u03c3 beam uncertainties, dxo (for BOOMERANG see\nFig. 2 of Netterfield et al. 2001; for MAXIMA-1 we add in quadrature the beam and pointing contributions given in Table 1 of Lee et\nal. 2001). The matrix A is given by the percentage errors for each\nbandpower, that is,\n\nA\n\n= diag(dxoi /xoi )\n\n(19)\n\nwhere xoi are the derived bandpowers and the normalization is such\nthat \u03c3b = 1.\nThe nature of the beam uncertainties, at least on scales larger\nthan the beam, can be understood qualitatively by considering the\ncase of a Gaussian beam whose angular size is not well known.\nFor a beam of true size \u03b8 and which has been misestimated to be\np\n\u03b80 , the predicted bandpower xi at mean multipole li must be is\ntransformed by the relation\nh\ni\np\u2032\np\nxi\n= xi exp l2i (\u03b820 \u2212 \u03b82 )\n(20)\n\u2243\n\np\n\nxi (1 + l2i (\u03b820 \u2212 \u03b82 ))\n\n(21)\n\n(assuming the estimate is not too far from the truth.) Thus if the\nbeam is assumed to be too small, the inferred band power will be\nsmaller than the true band power. The error in the measurement\nwill increase for band powers at higher l. If the beam uncertainty\nis small compared to its mean size (\u03c3\u03b8 << \u03b80 ) and is Gaussianly\ndistributed, then (\u03b82 \u2212 \u03b820 ) will also be Gaussian distributed, with a\nwidth of \u03c3\u03b82 = 2\u03c3\u03b8 \u03b80 . The marginalization then can be performed\nexactly as derived in Section 2, with \u03c3b = \u03c3\u03b82 and A = diag(l2i ),\n\nwhere li is the mean multipole of the ith band. In practice, this is\nvery close the scaling of beam uncertainties given by the experiments such as BOOMERANG and MAXIMA.\nFast marginalization over the beam uncertainty alone may be\ncarried out in a similar way to that over the calibration uncertainty.\nHowever, since the recent experiments with a beam uncertainty also\ncarry a calibration uncertainty, we proceed straight to marginalization over both the calibration and beam uncertainties simultaneously.\n\n3.3 Calibration and Beam Uncertainty\nThe equations for fast computation use the quantities already defined in Eq.s 13, 15 to 18 and 19.

However it is very tempting to save\nconsiderable computer time by ignoring these uncertainties. In this\nsection we apply the formulae presented above to CMB data, investigating how big a difference the inclusion of calibration and\nbeam uncertainties make to parameter estimation. We consider the\nlatest BOOMERANG and COBE data alone, for simplicity and because this data set has the largest calibration and beam uncertainties. The power spectrum from this experiment was estimated in\n19 bins spanning the range 75 6 l 6 1050. Since no information\non the BOOMERANG window functions and full covariance matrix is publicly available yet, we assign a top-hat window function\nfor the spectrum in each bin and neglect correlations between bins.\nThis approach is a good approximation of the correct one (see de\nBernardis et al. 2001) and does not affect our conclusions. For our\nmarginalisations over the beam uncertainties, we took the 1 \u2212 \u03c3 error bars from Fig. 2 of Netterfield et al. (2001). We also include\nthe COBE data using the RADPack packages (Dodelson & Knox\n2000).\nThe theoretical models are computed using the publicly available CMBFAST code (Seljak & Zaldarriaga). The ranges of our\ndatabase of models, or equivalently top hat priors, are 0.1 < \u03a9m <\nc 2001 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20136\n\n\fAnalytic marginalization over CMB calibration and beam uncertainty\n1.0, 0.015 < \u03a9b < 0.2, 0.0 < \u03a9\u039b < 1.0 and 0.25 < h < 0.95. We\ndefine h = H0 /(100 kms\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ) throughout. We vary the spectral index of the primordial density perturbations within the range\n0.5 < ns < 1.5 and we re-scale the amplitude of fluctuations by a\npre-factor C10 . We also assume an external Gaussian prior on the\nHubble parameter h = 0.70 \u00b1 0.1 and limit the analysis to models\nwith age t0 > 10 Gyrs (see, e.g. Ferreras, Melchiorri, Silk 2001).\nIt is important to note that the constraints we will derive on the\nvarious parameters are heavily affected by the size of our database\nand by the priors assumed. Considering a background of gravitational waves or a different optical depth of the universe, for example, would change our constraints. Here we illustrate the effect of\nthe CMB systematics on just the simplest models.\nWe find that neglecting the calibration error the scalar spectral index ns = 0.91 \u00b1 0.04, while when including calibration ns =\n0.89 \u00b1 0.06. Even though these numbers are compatible, it is important to notice that a scale invariant ns = 1 power spectrum is\nexcluded at 2\u03c3 in the first case, while is still inside two standard\ndeviations when the calibration error is included.\nWe consider the constraints on the physical baryon density parameter \u03a9b h2 . The baryon density plays a crucial role in the determination of the relative amplitude of the peaks in the power spectrum and could therefore be significantly affected by beam uncertainty. This is particularly true if only the first two Doppler peaks\nare well constrained by the data. (The determination of a third peak\nwould likely break this degeneracy.) Neglecting beam uncertainty\none obtains the tight constraint \u03a9b h2 = 0.022 \u00b1 0.004, excluding a\nlow \u03a9b h2 \u223c 0.010 region which is still compatible with some Big\nBang Nucleosynthesis data at more than 2\u03c3, while including the\nbeam error one infers \u03a9b h2 = 0.020 \u00b1 0.006.\nWe find that the constraint on the universe curvature is insensitive to whether beam and calibration uncertainties are taken into\naccount, which is perhaps to be expected since the curvature affects the acoustic peak positions, rather than their amplitudes. We\nalso found that the constraints on the cold dark matter physical density remain at \u03a9c h2 = 0.13 \u00b1 0.05 whether or not calibration and/or\nbeam uncertainties are taken into account.\nThe fast method presented in this Paper is crucially important\nwhen combining multiple experiments, each of which may have independent calibration and beam uncertainties. These introduce new\nunknown parameters and current popular methods are severely affected by an increase in the number of free parameters. However\nnote that Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (see Knox, Christensen & Skordis, 2001) are much less affected by increases in the\nnumber of free parameters.\nUsing the formulae presented here, the \u03c72cb values for each experiment are simply added together. Thus the computational time\nis still only a few times longer than that when calibration and beam\nuncertainties are ignored completely. To illustrate this we combined the latest BOOMERANG, MAXIMA, DASI and COBE data\nto obtain cosmological parameter constraints. We find that the results on the scalar spectral index are ns = 0.91 \u00b1 0.02 if we do\nno take in to account calibration and beam uncertainties, while\nwe obtain a similar value but larger error bars ns = 0.91 \u00b1 0.04\nwhen the above systematics are considered. However, we found\n\u03a9b h2 = 0.019+0.003\n\u22120.002 independent of whether calibration and beam\nuncertainties are taken into account. This is mainly due to the absence of beam uncertainty for DASI.\nFor the BOOMERANG plus COBE analysis we also compare\nwith a numerical marginalization, in which the calibration error is\n'maximised' over and the beam error is marginalised over in seven\nintegration steps. We find very consistent results, thus the analyses\nc 2001 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20136\n\n5\n\ncarried out by the experimental teams using this type of numerical approach can be relied on. However note that when combining\nmore data sets each with independent calibration (and beam) uncertainties this numerical method is no longer practical.\n\n5 CONCLUSION\nOur result for the analytic marginalization over calibration uncertainty is simple, easy to implement and fast. In general, a numerical\nmarginalization (integration) over calibration and beam increases\nthe computation time by a factor equal to the number of integration\nsteps squared. Inclusion of calibration uncertainties by analytical\nmethods does not increase computation times, and adding in beam\nuncertainties leads to a further increase by a factor of only two or\nthree. This is true irrespective of the number of different data sets,\neach with their own independent calibration and beam uncertainties.\nWe have shown that marginalization over the calibration and\nbeam uncertainties can make a significant difference to parameter\nestimation, particularly in widening the error bars on some parameters as much as fifty per cent. We verify that the constraint on the\nuniverse curvature is unaffected by the inclusion of the calibration\nand/or beam uncertainty, but that the physical density of baryons\nor the spectral index of primordial fluctuations ns can be significantly affected, allowing significantly lower values for \u03a9b h2 and\nwidening the error bars for ns .\nIn summary, we show that calibration and beam uncertainties\nshould be taken into account and we present a method which allows\nthis to be done exactly and with little extra work.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Ofer Lahav, Keith Grainge, Adam Ritz, Daniel Eisenstein, Steve Gull and Lloyd Knox for helpful discussions.

Here we will try to justify this choice, show why it often arises and discuss some simple\nforms that xb may take.\nIn general, the data could be an arbitrary function of the theoretical predictions and the nuisance parameter, i.e. xp\u2032 = Fb (xp ).\nHowever, often the raw measurements, xo and N , are not reported\ndirectly. Instead, experimentalists give results which may be compared to the theoretical predictions by assuming the best estimate\nof the nuisance parameter, b = b\u0304. They solve then for the inferred\nobservations given that value to find xo\u2032 \u2261 Fb\u0304 \u22121 (xo ), and solve for\nits noise correlation matrix in the same way. The likelihoods derived using this new variable are equivalent to those derived using\nthe original variables. While the variables are rescaled, so are their\ninferred noise levels, leaving the likelihoods unchanged.\nThe theoretical predictions for these new inferred observables\nare\nFb\u0304 \u22121 Fb (xp )\n\n=\n=\n\nFb\u0304 \u22121 Fb\u0304 (xp ) + (b \u2212 b\u0304)\nxp + (b \u2212 b\u0304)\n\n\u2202Fb\u0304 \u22121 Fb (xp )\n\u2202b\n\n\u2202Fb\u0304 \u22121 Fb (xp )\n\u2202b\n\n+...\n\n+...\nb=b\u0304\n\n(32)\n\nb=b\u0304\n\nwhere the first relation follows from a Taylor expansion. We can\nnow see that the form of xp\u2032 used above arises naturally when we\nare considering the xo\u2032 variables and we can associate xb with a\nparticular function of Fb . If the higher order terms become important for reasonable values of b, then the analytic methods described\nhere will not be applicable. This will depend on how well the nuisance parameter is known. In addition, it often happens that Fb is\nlinear in b, where these higher order terms are identically zero.\nLet us consider some simple examples of transformations Fb\nand the form of the xb vectors assoiated with them. If we take a\nsimple displacement, Fb (xp ) = xp + bxf , where xf is a fixed template independent of the predictions, then it is easy to show that\nFb\u0304 \u22121 Fb (xp ) = xp + (b \u2212 b\u0304)xf , so xb = xf . We can also consider a\nsimple multiplicative factor Fb (xp ) = bxp , as might arise from simple calibration uncertainties. Then Fb\u0304 \u22121 Fb (xp ) = xp +(b \u2212 b\u0304)xp /b\u0304.\nWe can absorb the 1/b\u0304 into the definition of b, so that xb = xp .\nFinally, consider the more complicated case where Fb (xp ) =\nA (b)xp , where A (b) is an n \u00d7 n matrix. Such is the case for\nbeam uncertainties, where what is measured are the band powers of the map smoothed by the beam and one is attempting to\ndetermine the band powers of the unsmoothed map. In this case,\nFb\u0304 \u22121 Fb (xp ) = xp + (b \u2212 b\u0304)A (b\u0304)\u22121 A \u2032 (b\u0304)xp . Thus, xb is some n \u00d7 n\nmatrix times xp . In the beam example, if the beam is Gaussian,\n2\nA (b) = diag(e\u2212bli ), so xb = \u2212diag(l2i )xp . In this example, we have\nignored higher order terms in (b \u2212 b\u0304), which may be important for\nband powers at high l, where the uncertainties caused by the poorly\ndetermined beam are of order the size of the measurements.\n\nc 2001 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20136\n\n7\n\n\f"}
