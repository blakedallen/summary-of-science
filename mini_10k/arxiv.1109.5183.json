Since then, more than 500 so-called\nexoplanets1 have been discovered, revolutionizing our knowledge of their nature and origin.\nAmong those discoveries, about 24 planets had their thermal emission directly detected by\nphotometric and/or spectroscopic measurements from space or ground, most of which are\nknown as \"hot Jupiters\" or \"hot Neptunes\" (e.g., Beerer et al. 2010; Machalek et al. 2010;\nNymeyer et al. 2010, etc.). So far, direct detection of thermal emission and characterization\nof planetary atmospheres is generally only possible for these hot planets as they are very\nclose to their host stars (<0.1AU), and are thus heated enough to have temperatures above\n1000K, providing as high as 10\u22123 of their host stars' flux in the infrared (e.g., J, H, K, and\nmid-infrared).\nThe atmospheres of hot Jupiters have many interesting properties. For instance, transmission spectra at primary eclipses have shown the presence of sodium, water and methane\n(e.g., Redfield et al. 2008; Swain et al. 2009), while thermal emission at secondary eclipses\nhas shown the presence of water, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide (e.g., Knutson 2007a;\nBarman 2008; Swain et al. 2008). Due to their close-in orbits, hot Jupiters are tidally locked\nto their host stars, leading to a constant day side that experiences intense stellar irradiation and a cold night side that remains in perpetual shadow (Guillot et al. 1996). The\ntemperature difference between the day and night sides thus induces atmospheric circulation and strong zonal winds to redistribute the heat (Knutson 2007b). Studies have also\nsuggested the existence of a hot stratosphere on the dayside of some hot Jupiters (e.g., HD\n209458b and HD 149026b), which inverts the temperature profile of higher atmospheric layers, and flips water absorptions into emissions (Knutson et al. 2008; Burrows et al. 2008;\n1\n\ndata from The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia: http://exoplanet.eu/catalog.php\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nMadhusudhan & Seager 2010). However, some other planets such as HD 189733b seem to\nlack such thermal inversion (Charbonneau et al. 2008; Grillmair et al. 2008), implying fundamental atmospheric differences between these planets and leading to sub-classification of\nhot Jupiters (Burrows et al. 2008). Studies of hot Jupiters' atmospheres will not only reveal\ntheir composition, structure, and dynamics, but will also shed light on our understanding\nof the planet formation processes. More importantly, characterizing hot Jupiters allows us\nto pave the path toward characterizations of Super-Earth planets and eventually, Earth-like\nplanets.\nAmong the \u223c 22 detected hot Jupiters, however, a majority of them are transiting\nplanets whose orbits are aligned with the line of sight from the Earth, and only 2 of them are\nnon-transiting planets (i.e., \u03c5 And b and HD 179949b, Harrington et al. (2006); Cowan et al.\n(2007)). The lack of studies of non-transiting hot Jupiters leaves a great opportunity for\nlong baseline optical/infrared interferometry, in that long baseline interferometers can see hot\nJupiter systems as extremely high-contrast binaries, and thus can directly determine their\norbital elements and provide accurate mass estimates. Interferometric measurements can also\nprovide absolute planet/star flux ratios (or star/planet contrasts) of non-transiting planets\nwhich cannot be disentangled by combined-light techniques (i.e., through transits). In fact,\ninterferometric measurements also provide an independent way of characterizing transiting\nplanets in addition to the combined light technique. Since the bulk of energy from hot\nJupiters emerges from the near-IR between 1-3 \u03bcm (Burrows et al. 2008), interferometry can\nprovide a better understanding of their spectra and global energy budget with measurements\nat near-IR bands.\nHowever, detecting the weak emission from a hot Jupiter from the ground is a difficult\ntask. To date, only a few hot Jupiters' thermal emission has been detected from the ground,\nwhile the rest were all achieved from space. To reach this goal, we require very stable and\nhigh precision measurements, and most importantly, require a method that can eliminate\nor calibrate the effects of Earth's atmospheric turbulence. One possible approach is to use\nhigh precision and high resolution closure phase measurements obtained with ground-based\ninterferometers. Closure phase is measured by combining the phases of three baselines in\na closed triangle. It is immune to any phase shifts induced by the atmospheric turbulence,\nincluding the differential chromatic dispersion that affects the differential phase. The major\nbiases or systematic errors of closure phase come from non-closed triangles introduced in\nthe measurement process, and in principle, can be precisely calibrated. Therefore, it is a\ngood observable for stable and precise measurements. More descriptions of the closure phase\ntechnique can be found in Monnier (2003, 2007).\nStudies have already been carried out to explore the possibilities of using closure phases\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nfor exoplanet detection (e.g., Joergens & Quirrenbach 2004; Zhao et al. 2008a, etc.). Particularly, Chelli et al. (2009) studied in detail the characteristics of closure phases and the\ncorresponding SNR when the primary star of a binary is getting resolved and approaching\nthe visibility null (i.e, \"Phase Closure Nulling\"). Using this method, Duvert et al. (2010) detected the faint close companion of HD 59717 at a contrast of \u223c 100 : 1 using VLTI/AMBER.\nRecently, Absil et al. (2010) also excluded the presence of a brown-dwarf companion in the\ninnermost region of the \u03b2 Pic planetary system at a upper contrast limit of \u223c 200 : 1 using\nclosure phases obtained by VLTI/AMBER.\nIn this paper, we report our closure phase studies toward the ultimate goal of directly\ndetecting emission from hot Jupiters using CHARA/MIRC. The paper is organized as follows.\nWe first briefly introduce our candidate \u03c5 And b and our observations in \u00a72. In \u00a73 we simulate\nthe closure phase signals and the required precision for the candidate. We then discuss the\ncalibration issues we encountered in test observations and present our solutions. Based on\nour calibrations, we present a preliminary upper limit for \u03c5 And b in \u00a74. Finally, we conclude\nour studies and give future prospects in \u00a75.\n2.\n\nCandidates and observations\n2.1.\n\nCandidates\n\nAmong all the known non-transiting hot Jupiters, several of them are within the sensitivity limit of CHARA/MIRC. \u03c5 And b is currently the most favorable candidate due to its\nrelatively high temperature and the high brightness of its host star. Therefore, in this study\nwe focus only on this best candidate.\n\u03c5 And is an F8V star located 13.5 pc away from the Sun. Butler et al. (1997) first\ndiscovered its hot Jupiter \u03c5 And b in 1997, which has a period of 4.6 days and is orbiting\nat 0.06 AU. The follow-up observations of Butler et al. (1999) found two more companions\nin the system, \u03c5 And c and \u03c5 And d. \u03c5 And c is orbiting at 0.83 AU from the host star\nwith a period of 241 days, while \u03c5 And d is orbiting at 2.5 AU with a period of 1267 days\n(Butler et al. 1999). Most recently, Curiel et al. (2011) found a fourth planet \u03c5 And e with a\nperiod of 3848.9 days at 5.25 AU. The system is non-coplanar. The inclination of the closest\nplanet \u03c5 And b is found to be likely \u2265 28o (Crossfield et al. 2010), while the second and the\nthird planets (\u03c5 And c & d) have a relative inclination of 15o-20o . In 2006, Harrington et al.\n(2006) directly detected thermal emission from the hot Jupiter \u03c5 And b using Spitzer MIPS\nat 24\u03bcm, in which they detected the relative day-night flux variations of the planet over five\nepochs of the whole 4.6-day orbital period, and provided a lower limit to the planet/star\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nflux ratio. Later, Crossfield et al. (2010) further refined the flux variation curve with more\nMIPS 24\u03bcm data, and found an unusually large phase shift of the flux maximum (\u223c 80o ).\nAtmospheric models have also been applied to interpret these Spitzer data. However, as\nBurrows et al. (2008) pointed out, due to the lack of absolute flux level and information in\nother wavelengths, there are too many degrees of freedom to draw strong conclusions about\nthe planetary and atmospheric properties. Thus, detection of its absolute planet/star flux\nratios and at other wavelengths such as near-IR are required to break model degeneracies.\nFurthermore, high signal-to-noise detections will even allow us to obtain the absolute phase\ncurve of the planet (Barman et al. 2005), providing constraints to the circulation and heat\nredistribution patterns of its atmosphere.\n\n2.2.\n\nObservations\n\nClosure phase measurements require at least three telescopes to be combined in a closed\ntriangle. Currently, the MIRC (Monnier et al. 2004) and CLIMB (Sturmann et al. 2010)\ninstruments at the CHARA array, and the AMBER (Petrov et al. 2007) and PIONIER2\ninstruments at the VLTI have this capability in the near-IR. In this study, we employ\nCHARA/MIRC for our measurements.\nThe CHARA array, located on Mt. Wilson, consists of six 1-meter telescopes (ten Brummelaar et al.\n2005). The array is arranged in a Y-shaped configuration to provide good position angle\ncoverage. The six telescopes form 15 baselines ranging from 34m to 331m, making CHARA\nthe longest-baseline optical/IR interferometer array in the world and providing a resolution\nof \u223c0.5 mas in the H band. The Michigan Infra-Red Combiner (MIRC) is an imaging combiner that currently combines 4 CHARA telescopes, providing 6 visibilities, 4 closure phases\nand 4 triple amplitudes simultaneously. MIRC works at both H and K bands, and has three\nspectral modes: R=40 (with prism), 150, & 500 (with grism). The lowest resolution mode\n(R=40) disperses light into 8 spectral channels on the detector, while the R=150 and R=500\nmodes disperse light into 24 channels and 80 channels respectively (see Monnier et al. 2004,\n2006, for details). The compact design of MIRC allows for stable calibration and precise\nclosure phase measurements, thus it is best suited for the purpose of this study.\nWe conducted observations of \u03c5 And on 23 nights from 2006 to 2010 with a total\nintegration time of 8.2 hours, following the standard observing procedures (Monnier et al.\n2007; Zhao et al. 2009). The observation log is listed in Table 1. Several combinations\nof four CHARA telescopes are used in the observations, while in most cases we adopt the\n2\n\nhttp://www-laog.obs.ujf-grenoble.fr/twiki/bin/view/Ipag/Projets/Pionier/WebHome\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\ncombination S1-E1-W1-W2 and S2-E2-W1-W2 for good baseline coverage. The observations\nwere mostly conducted in the H band (\u03bb=1.5 - 1.8 \u03bcm) with the lowest resolution mode of\nR=40, except for two nights in 2010 when we employed the higher resolution mode of R=150.\nEach observation of the target was bracketed with calibrators for visibility and closure phase\ncalibration. For the purpose of bias subtraction and flux calibration, each set of fringe data is\nbracketed with measurements of background (i.e., data taken with all beams closed), shutter\nsequences (i.e., data taken with only one beam open at a time to estimate the amount of light\ncoming from each beam), and foreground (i.e., data taken with all beams open but without\nfringes) (Pedretti et al. 2009). Each object is observed for multiple sets. During the period\nof taking fringe data, a group-delay fringe tracker is used to track the fringes (Thureau et al.\n2006). In order to track the flux coupled into each beam in \"real time\" to improve the\nvisibility measurements, we used spinning choppers to temporally modulate the light going\ninto each fiber simultaneously with fringe measurements. In 2009, photometric channels were\ncommissioned for MIRC (Che et al. 2010), and the choppers were made obsolete because\nof the much better real-time flux calibration provided by the photometric channels. The\ndata reduction process also follows the pipeline outlined in (Monnier et al. 2007), where the\nclosure phases are extracted from the phase term of the complex triple amplitudes after the\nsubtraction of background, foreground, and correction of fiber coupling efficiencies.\n\n3.\n\nClosure phase simulations and calibration studies\n3.1.\n\nSimulations\n\nBecause exoplanet-host stars and their hot Jupiters are similar to high contrast close\nbinaries, we simulate the closure phase signals using binary models for \u03c5 And b. We choose\nto use the longest telescope triangle of the CHARA array (i.e., S1-E1-W1) in our study to\nobtain the highest closure phase levels (Chelli et al. 2009). The latest orbital properties of \u03c5\nAnd b and the size of its host star are listed in Table 2. The Infrared planet/star flux ratios\nare adopted from the models of Sudarsky et al. (2003).\nFigure 1 shows the closure phase simulations for \u03c5 And b at four wavelength channels.\nSince the value of the ascending node (\u03a9) is unknown for \u03c5 And b, we assume 4 different\nvalues in our simulations: \u03a9 = 0o , 45o, 90o , 135o. The inclination is fixed to the most probable\nvalues assuming that the planet is coplanar with the star's rotation (see Table 2). Figure 1\nshows that the closure phase signal varies rapidly as the baseline projection varies during the\nEarth's rotation. Shorter wavelength channels generally have higher signal amplitudes and\npeak at \u223c \u00b10.08o , due to the fact that the host star is more resolved at those wavelengths.\nThe overall closure phase level of \u03c5 And b is insensitive to the values of \u03a9 in the simulation\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nbecause of CHARA's even baseline layout (i.e., the Y-shape), which covers all position angles\nmore or less equally well. We note here that because the visibility of the star \u03c5 And only\ngoes to null at certain wavelength channels, the closure phase signal in the simulation is very\nsensitive to the value of adopted stellar diameter. Figure 1 also indicates that in order to\ndetect the closure phase signal from \u03c5 And b, the required 1-\u03c3 precision has to be better\nthan roughly \u00b10.05o .\n3.2.\n\nCalibration studies\n\nTo compare the precision of our measurements with the simulations, we first examine\nthe quality and stability of our data. The left panels of Figure 2 show a good night of\nclosure phase measurements for the middle wavelength channel of MIRC, obtained with\nthe largest triangle of CHARA (S1-E1-W1). The closure phases\nare stable over the 1.5\n\u221a\nhrs of observation and the error averages down roughly as N (the bottom left panel),\nsuggesting the measurements are immune from systematic errors like changes in the seeing.\nThe nominal measurement error is 0.3o when averaging the whole 1.5 hrs of observation\ntogether. The performance at a similar channel with a shorter triangle of CHARA (E2-W1W2) is demonstrated to be about 3 times better in Zhao et al. (2008b).\nAlthough these measurements are promising and stable, we have also encountered large\nunexpected systematic errors in other wavelength channels. As indicated in the right panels\nof Figure 2, the closure\n\u221a phases show a systematic drift and the associated errors cannot\nbe averaged down as N . In fact, the closure phases not only change with time, but also\nvary as a function of wavelength. More interestingly, the closure phase drifts are highly\ncorrelated for all calibrators within a whole observing run of many nights. Figure 3 plots\nclosure phases of six calibrators obtained in 6 nights in 2008 August (Algenib, 38 Tau, \u03b3\nLyr, \u03b3 Tri, \u03b6 Peg, \u03b6 Per) versus azimuth angles. There is a clear trend of closure phase\nchange as a function of azimuth in the figure. Figure 4 shows the similar correlation of\nclosure phase with altitude. The closure phase drift reaches about 8 degrees between the top\nand the bottom panel. In addition, we can also see an obvious slope change centered at the\nmiddle wavelength channels in both Figures 3 & 4. Although only 3 wavelength channels\nare shown here, the slope actually changes gradually from the first to the last channels of\nMIRC, and similar effects are also seen in other observing runs. Although the data shown\nin these figures were obtained in 6 nights, the correlations with altitude and azimuth are\nstrong and consistent, suggesting that the major cause of the closure phase drifts may stem\nfrom the changing positions of the targets on the sky.\nPossible causes of the closure phase drifts may include: 1. polarization effects caused\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nby the non-identical beam trains of CHARA; and 2. extra dispersions in the delaylines that\nare not compensated in vacuum, which can contaminate closure phases across wavelength\nchannels and change with target position. To investigate the individual causes and find out\nthe best solution, we carried out a series of experiments with: 1. using a linear polarizer\nto reduce the effect of polarization; 2. using a linear polarizer and a 40\u03bcm slit to reduce\nthe effect of polarization and partially reduce dispersion; and 3. using a grism of R\u223c150 to\nreduce dispersion only. We determine the slopes of the closure phase change as a function of\nonly altitude for simplicity. Since the slopes of the closure phases also drift across wavelength\nchannels (see Figure 4), we use the magnitude of the slope change, i.e., (slope of channel 8\n\u2212 slope of channel 1), to characterize the closure phase changes. The magnitudes of slope\nchange are averaged over four closure phase triangles of each observing run, and the errors\nare determined from the scatter of the four triangles. The results of the experiments are\nshown and compared in Table 3.\nTable 3 shows that the original observations have the largest magnitude of closure phase\nchange. Observations with polarizer and polarizer + 40\u03bcm slit have slightly smaller magnitudes of closure phase change. However, we have also seen some nights without polarizers\nhave similar or even lower drifts than those with the polarizer, indicating the effect of using\na polarizer is small and the major cause of the drifts may not be polarization effects. When\nusing the grism of R=150, however, the correlated closure phase drifts and slope change\nbecome nearly zero. Although we only had a very small amount of data for the experiments,\nthis preliminary result indicates that the extra air dispersion from the delaylines is most\nlikely the major cause of the closure phase drifts, which contaminates closure phases with\nnon-closed triangles from other wavelengths, especially at the edges of the bandpass. The\ndispersion effect also explains the slope change centered at the middle wavelength channels\nseen in Figures 3 & 4.\nSince the closure phase changes shown in Figures 3 & 4 are highly correlated for all\nnights within an observing run with consistent system and optical settings. We can use all\ncalibrators from a run to look for a solution to calibrate the drifts. We have experimented\nwith several function forms to characterize the slopes, including linear function, linear surface, quadratic surface, etc. A linear surface fit can estimate the closure phase drifts well,\nwhile a quadratic surface fit works the best. Figure 5 shows an example of our best approach of fitting the closure phases with quadratic surface functions of both target altitude\nand azimuth. The quadratic surface function characterizes the drifts very well for nearly all\nwavelength channels, as indicated by the improved \u03c72 values in the plot. It therefore can be\nemployed as a new empirical model to calibrate our data within the same observing run.\nThere is also a caveat, however, that this calibration scheme requires a wide span of\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\ncalibrator positions on the sky for a good coverage of altitude and azimuth to bracket the\ntarget, so that the quadratic fit can reliably estimate the closure phase change. However,\nmost of our observations have a limited number of calibrators and calibrator visits, and\nthus do not have a wide range of position coverage. Therefore, we adopt the results from a\nlinear surface fit for those cases instead in order to avoid unreliable or erroneous quadratic\nextrapolation, with a trade-off of slightly less accurate closure phase calibration. Further\nvalidations of these schemes and their robustness are required in a future work.\n\n4.\n\nDiameter and upper limits for \u03c5 And b\n4.1.\n\nRefined diameter\n\nWe first determine the angular diameter of \u03c5 And with a uniform disk (UD) model and\na limb-darkened disk (LD) model. The squared-visibilities (V 2 ) of the data are calibrated\nin the regular way as described in Monnier et al. (2007). UD diameters of the calibrators\nare listed in Table 4. We apply a power law limb darkening, I(\u03bc) = \u03bc\u03b1 , for the LD model\n(Hestroffer 1997). Since the limb darkening coefficient \u03b1 is similar for stars with the same\nspectral type, we adopt a fixed \u03b1 and only vary the diameter in our LD fit. The value of \u03b1\nis interpolated and converted from the square root law coefficients of van Hamme (1993). A\nvalue of \u03b1 \u2243 0.18 is estimated for \u03c5 And, assuming [F e/H]=0.15 (Butler et al. 2006). We\nbootstrap3 the V 2 data from different nights to simulate the statistics. Each bootstrapped\ndata set is then fit with a UD and LD model separately with \u03c72 minimization. A number\nof 150 bootstrap iterations are carried out and the median of the 150 best-fit diameters are\ntaken as the global best-fit, while the 1-\u03c3 error is determined from the scatter. Figure 6 shows\nthe best-fit models of \u03c5 And, together with the binned data. Our final best-fit UD of \u03c5 And is\n1.097\u00b10.009 mas, consistent with the FLUOR (Coud\u00e9 du Foresto et al. 2003) measurement\nof 1.098\u00b10.007 mas (M\u00e9rand 2008, private communication), and the results of Baines et al.\n(2008), 1.091\u00b10.009 mas. The best-fit LD size is 1.121\u00b10.007 mas, also consistent with\nthe result of Baines et al. (2008), and corresponding to a radius of 1.625\u00b10.011 R\u2299 for the\n3\n\nBootstrapping is a technique that can provide robust simulations of the distribution of a data set. It is\nvery useful for data sets with complicated or unknown distributions, and is widely used to derive estimates of\nstandard errors and confidence intervals (Press et al. 1992; Efron & Tibshirani 1993). Since we use multiple\nnights of data with various of baselines and different systematics (within each night) for joint solutions, the\ndistributions of our parameters of interest are unknown. Thus, bootstrapping is a suitable technique for\nour data. Bootstrapping requires the assumption that the data are independent and identically distributed.\nThis assumption holds for our data because we treat each night of data equally, each night's are independent\nand are acquired in the same way.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nparallax of 74.12 \u00b1 0.19 mas (van Leeuwen 2007) (with error propagated).\n4.2.\n\nUpper limits\n\nSince we do not have enough SNR to detect the planet from a single night of observation,\nwe can take the advantage of the well known orbital parameters of \u03c5 And b and combine all\nobservations in Table 1 together to increase the total SNR for higher precision. Due to the\nquickly varying closure phases caused by the Earth's rotation, as shown in Figure 1, we split\nthe data into small chunks with an averaging time of less than 10min to avoid smearing the\nsignal.\nTo calibrate the large closure phase systematics described in last section, we apply\nthe new calibration scheme by fitting a quadratic surface function to all calibrators within\neach observing run, and subtracting the predicted zero closure phases from the raw values.\nFor observing runs with inadequate calibrator coverages, we use the results from linear\nsurface fit instead of quadratic fit. The total uncertainty of each data point is estimated\nby bootstrapping the data used in the quadratic or linear surface fit, and combining the\nadditional uncertainty with the original values. Figure 7 compares the results before and\nafter applying the new calibration scheme for the 23 nights of data. As we can see in Figure\n7, the non-zero closure phases are calibrated out and the large scatters are reduced in the\nnewly calibrated data.\nWe then fit the new closure phase data with binary models to search for the closure\nphase signal from the planet. Because the closure phases are different for each channel, we\ndetermine planet/star flux ratios for each of the 8 wavelength channels simultaneously at\nthe same orbital position, and search for the best position with a joint \u03c72 minimization.\nThe orbital positions of the system are calculated by fixing the well known parameters from\nradial velocity observations, i.e., P, T0 , e, and \u03c9, and only varying the semi-major axis, \u03a9,\nand inclination. The method and the corresponding codes are validated with data of the\nwell-known binary \u03b9 Peg from Monnier (2007).\nAlthough we have searched the parameter space extensively, we do not clearly detect \u03c5\nAnd b in our fits, suggesting that our current signal-to-noise ratio is still inadequate. We thus\ndecided to report our results in terms of an upper limit to the planet/star flux ratio. To do\nthis, we simulate the statistics of the best-fit planet/star flux ratios by bootstrapping different\nnights of data. This approach treats each night of data equally, ensuring the robustness of\nthe bootstrap by preventing data from certain nights dominating the statistics. Because\nnoise is dominant in the data, we use a fine grid search to ensure robust results. For each\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nbootstrapped data set, we searched an extensive range of semi-major axis, \u03a9, inclination,\nand the planet/star flux ratios at each of the 8 spectral channels. The set of parameters that\nyields the minimum \u03c72 is then chosen as the \"best-fit\". A total of 150 bootstrap iterations\nare carried out, and the corresponding distributions of the best-fit planet/star flux ratios are\nshown in Figure 8.\nThe dashed lines in Figure 8 indicate the upper limits of 90% confidence level, i.e.,\nwith 90% of chance these upper limits are higher than the actual planet/star flux ratios.\nFigure 9 shows the upper limits together as a \"spectrum\", and compares it with planet\natmospheric models based on Barman et al. (2005) (Barman 2011, private communication)\nand Sudarsky et al. (2003). Our upper limits are at the 6 \u00d7 10\u22124 level on average. The first\nchannel gives the best limit and reaches a level of 4.7\u00d710\u22124 , corresponding to a star/planet\ncontrast ratio of 2.1\u00d7103 :1. This result stands as one of the highest contrast limits achieved\nby closure phase measurements to date.\nOur 90% upper limits for the middle channels are about a factor of 5-8 from the predicted\nvalue of \u03c5 And b, suggesting that with further improvement in precision, we will be able\nto start constraining atmospheric models for hot Jupiters with interferometry. In fact, the\nprecision of the new calibration for these data is not perfect due to their lack of wide calibrator\ncoverages on the sky. In addition, although the new calibration can correct for the closure\nphase drifts caused by dispersion, the use of calibrators from multiple nights makes the nightto-night variation hard to calibrate, leaving uncorrected systematic errors in the data. To\nreduce these effects and further improve our calibration precision, the new observing scheme\nusing higher spectral resolution (using the grism of R=150 for MIRC in this case) and more\ncalibrators is necessary. Benefitting from this experiment and analysis, better precision is\nexpected in future observations.\n\n5.\n\nConclusions and future prospects\n\nWe have simulated the closure phases for the best hot Jupiter candidate \u03c5 And b, and\ninvestigated the precision and stability of our measurements obtained with CHARA/MIRC.\nAlthough our closure phase precisions can reach 0.3o /1.5hrs for the middle wavelength channel of MIRC with good conditions, we have also encountered unexpected closure phase drifts\nas large as 8o in other channels. The closure phase drifts are highly correlated with altitude\nand azimuth angles of the targets. The slopes of the drifts also vary across spectral channels,\ncentering at the middle channels of MIRC. Because the drifts are correlated for all calibrators\nwithin an observing run, we are able to model the trend to calibrate the drifts. This new\ncalibration model, however, is highly dependent on the altitude and azimuth coverage of the\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\ncalibrators and may not be accurate for sparse coverage. With a set of diagnostics, we find\nthat the closure phase drifts are most likely caused by extra dispersion in the delaylines,\nwhich contaminates closure phases with non-closed triangles from other wavelengths, especially at the edges of the bandpass. Using higher spectral resolution can effectively reduce\nthis effect. We therefore advocate future observations of CHARA/MIRC to use the grism\nmode of R=150 for better calibration precision.\nTaking advantage of the well known orbital parameters of \u03c5 And b, we have combined\nmultiple nights of observations together for a joint solution of upper limits for the planet/star\nflux ratios across the H band. Our best upper limit indicates a contrast ratio of about\n2.1\u00d7103 :1 at 90% confidence level, standing as one of the highest upper limits yet achieved\nby closure phase measurements. Future observations with reduced dispersion contaminations\nusing the grism mode are expected to have better performance.\nRecently, photometric channels for real-time flux calibration have been implemented for\nMIRC (Che et al. 2010). The photometric channels have not only improved the visibility\ncalibration, but also improved the data taking efficiency for MIRC by a factor of \u223c 2 by\nreducing the time spent on repositioning fibers of each MIRC beam. The CHAMP fringe\ntracker for MIRC (Berger et al. 2008) has been commissioned in 2009 and is expected to\nbe fully functional soon. CHAMP will help track and stabilize the fringes to increase their\ncoherence time, allowing longer integration for MIRC and therefore can increase the SNR to\nthe photon-limited regime and significantly improve the precision. In addition, CHARA is\nseeking an adaptive optics upgrade (Ridgway et al. 2008) that could increase the throughput of MIRC by at least a factor of 2, which could greatly improve the sensitivity and data\ntaking efficiency. With these implemented and upcoming improvements and the new observing scheme, we are expecting much better closure phase performance and are optimistic of\nachieving the goal of detecting emission from hot Jupiters in the near future.\nThe CHARA Array is funded by the Georgia State University, by the National Science\nFoundation through grant AST-0908253, by the W.
