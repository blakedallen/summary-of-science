We utilise the transversecoordinate (or impact-parameter) representation which diagonalises the equations and\nstudy in detail the dependence on the transverse coordinate induced by the CCFM evolution. We find considerable broadening of the transverse-momentum distributions with\nan increasing magnitude of the hard scale, Q. For instance, at the Bjorken x = 0.1 the\nroot mean squared transverse momentum of the gluons is enhanced by about 1 GeV when\nevolved from the the initial low scale to Q2 = 10 GeV2 , and by about 2 GeV when evolved\nup to to Q2 = 100 GeV2 . The broadening effect is enhanced with decreasing Bjorken x,\nand is stronger for the gluons than for the quarks. Analytic solution for the average\ntransverse momentum corresponding to the x-moments of the distributions is obtained.\nThe parton luminosities are also discussed.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nParton distributions are fundamental and universal quantities of the QCD-improved parton\nmodel. They depend on the longitudinal momentum fraction of the parent hadron, x, as well\nas on the hard scale of the process, Q. The inclusive cross-sections describing hard processes are\ngoverned by the (collinear) factorisation theorem expressing those cross-sections as convolutions\nof partonic distributions and hard (partonic) cross-sections [1]. On the other hand, less inclusive\n\n\fmeasurements are often sensitive to the transverse momenta of the partons and require an\nintroduction of the unintegrated parton distributions, i.e. distributions which are not integrated\nover the transverse momentum of the parton [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. These unintegrated\ndistributions depend then upon the transverse momentum of the parton besides the dependence\non x and Q. Typical cases where the information on the transverse momentum of partons is\nneeded are the prompt photon production, or the transverse momentum distributions of the\nDrell-Yan lepton pairs, W \u00b1 and Z 0 bosons, etc. The unintegrated parton distributions are also\nneeded in the calculations made within the kT -factorisation framework [12, 13, 14, 15, 16].\nThe unintegrated parton distributions are described by the Catani-Ciafaloni-Fiorani- Marchesini (CCFM) equations [17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27] which are based on the quantum\ncoherence implying angular ordering along the partonic cascade [28]. In the so-called single-loop\napproximation [19,20], adequate for large and moderately small values of x (say, x > 0.01), the\nCCFM equations reproduce the conventional leading-order DGLAP equations for the integrated\ndistributions. Thus, they may be viewed as an extension of the DGLAP evolution which allows\nto investigate more general quantities.\nThe purpose of this paper is to analyse in detail the unintegrated parton distributions of\npions and nucleons. To this aim we explore the system of the CCFM equations in the single\nloop approximation utilising the transverse-coordinate representation of the parton distributions. The transverse-coordinate, denoted in this paper by b, is a variable conjugate to the\ntransverse momentum of the parton. It has been widely used in the study of the soft gluon\nresummation effects in the e+ e\u2212 collisions [29,30], in the transverse-momentum distributions of\nthe Drell-Yan pairs or gauge bosons [31], etc. The formalism adopted in our analysis is similar\nto methods used in those studies. An important merit of our use of the transverse-coordinate\nrepresentation is the fact that it diagonalises the system of the CCFM equations in the singleloop approximation [32,33]. In practice, this means that the equations are solved independently\nfor each value of b. Also, in this approximation the non-perturbative effects encoded in the\nchoice of the initial dependence on b at the reference scale Q0 (the profile function) factorise\nin the solution at a scale Q. This input profile introduces the damping factor for large values\nof b that makes it possible to extend smoothly the partonic kT -distributions down to the point\nkT = 0. The CCFM evolution changes the dependence on b and leads to significant broadening\nof the transverse momentum distributions. The average transverse momentum squared grows\napproximately linearly with Q2 (modulo logarithmic corrections). The effect is strongest for\n1/2\ngluons, when e.g. for Q2 = 100 GeV2 the CCFM evolution is found to generate hkT2 ievol about\n2.3 GeV for x = 0.1 and 3.2 GeV for x = 0.01. These numbers should be compared to the initial\nspreading, hkT2 iF , which is typically assumed to be in the range of (0.5 \u2212 1 GeV). Broadening\nof the kT distribution corresponds to the development of the long-range tail in the distribution\nat large kT .\nThe average transverse momenta squared can be expressed in terms of the logarithmic\nderivative of the distributions in the b representation at b = 0. Factorisation of the input\n2\n\n\fprofile implies that the average transverse momentum squared of the parton is the sum of the\n'primordial' (non-perturbative) component at Q0 and the term generated by the evolution.\nThe unintegrated parton distributions are constrained by the integrated distributions which\ncorrespond to the integrals of the unintegrated distributions over the transverse momentum\nsquared of the partons. In order to make our analysis realistic we use constraints implied by\nthe results of the global LO QCD analysis [34, 35] for the integrated distributions of pions\nand nucleons. To be precise, we take the same parametrisation of the starting integrated\ndistributions as those used in [34, 35] and assume, as an educated guess, a Gaussian transverse\nmomentum distribution, uniform for gluons and quarks 1 . Combining this assumption with\nthe evolution from the CCFM equations in the single-loop approximation one should get a set\nof realistic unintegrated parton distributions hadrons. These can be used in phenomenological\napplications in the mentioned region of large and moderately small values of x, where the\nsingle-loop approximation is expected to be adequate.\nThe content of our paper is as follows: In the next section we recall the system of the CCFM\nequations in the single-loop approximation and discuss its transverse coordinate representation.\nIn Sec. 3 we discuss the unintegrated parton distributions of pions and nucleons which follow\nfrom the numerical solution of the CCFM equations in the single-loop approximation. We\npresent our results for the b profiles and for the transverse-momentum distributions, as well\nas discuss the increase of the average transverse momentum with the increasing magnitude of\nthe hard scale, Q, at different values of x. In Sec. 4 we discuss the moments of the b profiles\nand present results for the average transverse momenta squared, < kT2 (n, Q2 ) >i , for the nth\nmoment for partons of species i. We also derive (semi)analytic expressions for < kT2 (n, Q2 ) >i .\nIn Sec. 5 we discuss partonic luminosities and, finally, in Sec. 6 we give a summary of our\nresults.\n\n2\n\nCCFM equations in the single loop approximation\n\nThe original Catani-Ciafaloni-Fiorani-Marchesini (CCFM) equation [17, 18] for the unintegrated, scale-dependent gluon distribution fG (x, kT , Q), which is generated by the sum of ladder\ndiagrams with angular ordering along the chain, has the following form:\nZ 2 Z 1\nd q\n\u03b1s\ndz\n0\n \u0303\nfG (x, kT , Q) = fG (x, kT , Q) +\n\u0398(Q \u2212 qz)\u0398(q \u2212 q0 ) \u2206S (Q, q, z)\n2\n\u03c0q x z\n2\u03c0\n\u0014\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0015\n2Nc z\nx\n\u00d7 2Nc \u2206N S (kT , q, z) +\nf\n, |kt + (1 \u2212 z)q|, q ,\n(1)\n(1 \u2212 z)\nz\n1\n\nThe assumption of uniformity may be lifted with no difficulty, as well as other initial parameterisations\nthan [34,35] may be tested. This has little influence on our general conclusion on the large dynamical spreading\nof the distributions.\n\n3\n\n\fwhere \u2206S (Q, q, z) and \u2206N S (kT , q, z) are the Sudakov and non-Sudakov form factors,\n\" Z 2\n#\nZ\nQ\ndp2 \u03b1s 1\u2212q0 /p\n\u2206S (Q, q, z) = exp \u2212\ndzzPgg (z) ,\n2\n(qz)2 p 2\u03c0 0\n\" Z\n#\nZ 2\n1\ndz \u2032 kT dp2 2Nc \u03b1s\n\u2206N S (kT , q, z) = exp \u2212\n.\nz \u2032 (qz \u2032 )2 p2 2\u03c0\nz\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nThe variables x, kT , and Q denote the longitudinal momentum fraction, the transverse momentum of the gluon, and the hard scale, respectively. The latter is defined in terms of the\nmaximum emission angle [10,17]. The constraint \u0398(Q\u2212qz) in Eq. (1) reflects the angular ordering, and the inhomogeneous term, f \u03030 (x, kT , Q), is related to the input non-perturbative gluon\ndistribution. It also contains effects of both the Sudakov and non-Sudakov form-factors [22].\nEquation (1) in a sense interpolates between a fragment of the DGLAP evolution at large x\nand the BFKL dynamics at small x. To be precise, it contains only the g \u2192 gg splittings and\nonly those parts of the splitting function Pgg (z) which are singular at either z \u2192 1 or z \u2192 0.\nIn order to make the CCFM framework more realistic in the region of large and moderately\nsmall values of x we make use of the following extension [33]:\n1. We introduce, besides the unintegrated gluon distributions fG (x, kT , Q), also the unintegrated quark and antiquark gluon distributions, fqi (x, kT , Q) and fq\u0304i (x, kT , Q).\n2.

The input profile function, F (b), is linked through the Fourier-Bessel transform\n(16) to the non-perturbative kT distribution at the scale Q0 . At b = 0 we have the normalisation\ncondition for the profile function, F (0) = 1.\n\n3\n\nUnintegrated parton distributions in the pion and nucleon\n\nSince the initial condition for the QCD evolution, Eq. (22), assumes a uniform dependence\non the profile function F (b) for all distribution functions fi , it is convenient to factorise this\n6\n\n\ffunction by introducing the 'tilde' distributions,\nf \u0303i (x, b, Q) = f \u0304i (x, b, Q)/F (b),\n\ni = G, S, NS.\n\n(23)\n\nThe evolution equations (18-20) can then be written in terms of the f \u0303 functions only. In other\nwords, all dynamical information on the b-dependence, generated by the evolution and linked\nto the Q and x variables, is contained in the f \u0303 functions, while the uniform initial profile F (b) is\ncarried over as a multiplicative factor and is decoupled from the dynamics. Certainly, we may\nchoose different profiles F (b), which affects directly the shape of the unintegrated distribution\nfunctions, nevertheless the evolution is independent of this choice, as long as the factorisation\nis assumed. For this reason we first present the numerical results for the scaled functions\nf \u0303i (x, b, Q).\nThe evolution equations for the f \u0303 functions are solved numerically. The method used is\nbased on the discretisation made with the help of the Chebyshev polynomials and is an extension of the method developed in [36] for the solution of the DGLAP equations.\nFigure 1 shows the solutions of Eqs. (18-20) for the case of the pion with the LO Gl\u00fcckReya-Schienbein (GRS) distributions [34] taken at the initial scale Q20 = 0.26 GeV2 . The left\nand right sides of the figure display the results for x = 0.1 and x = 0.01, i.e. moderately\nlarge and moderately small values of the Bjorken variable. We show, from top to bottom,\nthe distributions f \u0303G , f \u0303S , and f \u0303N S , plotted as functions of the transverse coordinate, b. The\nvarious types of lines indicate consecutive values of the momentum Q, with the solid line\ncorresponding to the initial scale of the GRS parameterisation, Q2 = Q20 = 0.26 GeV2 [34],\nand the dashed, dash-dotted and dotted lines denoting results for Q2 = 1 GeV2 , 10 GeV2 , and\n100 GeV2 , respectively. The original distributions at Q = Q0 are flat in b, since we use the\nrescaled functions (23). We note immediately from the figure that the increase of Q results\nin sharp peaking of the distributions at b = 0, with the effect stronger at the smaller value of\nx. The shrinkage of the distributions in b is most prominent for the gluons. For instance, for\nthe gluons at x = 0.01 the curves drop to half of the values at b = 0 around b = 2, 1.2, and\n0.6 GeV\u22121 for Q2 = 1, 10, and 100 GeV2 , respectively. To the extent these distributions can be\napproximated with a Gaussian, that would correspond to widths in the transverse momentum\nof about 0.8 GeV, 1.4 GeV, and 3 GeV, respectively. The transverse-momentum distributions\nwill be discussed in detail in the following parts of the paper. At the values of x displayed in\nFig. 1 the shrinking effect in b is similar for the singlet and non-singlet quark distributions.\nWe note that for the case of gluons at x = 0.01 the function f \u0303G becomes negative above\nb \u223c 4 GeV\u22121 . To our knowledge, this poses no physical problems. Positivity is required for\nthe unintegrated distributions in the transverse-momentum space, since then the positivity of\ncross-sections, which are physical quantities, is guaranteed. The Fourier-Bessel transform of a\npositive function, however, need not be positive itself. We will see shortly that in the transversemomentum space the distributions are positive. The effect of negative f \u0303G at larger b and small\nx is an artifact of the valence-like input for the gluons in the parameterisations of Refs. [34,35],\n7\n\n\fand can be understood as follows: At small x the evolution equation (20) is dominated on the\nright-hand side by the gluon contribution, hence can be approximated with the following form:\n\u2202 f \u0303G (x, b, Q)\n=\n\u2202Q2\nZ\nn\n\u0010x\n\u0011\no\n\u03b1s (Q2 ) 1\ndzJ0 [(1 \u2212 z)Qb] Pgg (z)f \u0303G\n, b, Q \u2212 [zPgg (z) + zPqg (z)]f \u0303G (x, b, Q)\n2\u03c0\nz\n0\n\u2212{zPqg (z) + zPgg (z)[1 \u2212 J0 ((1 \u2212 z)Qb)]f \u0303G (x, b, Q)}\n(24)\nQ2\n\nAt small x the dominant region of integration in the first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (24)\nis x < z << 1, hence we may approximate 1 \u2212 z by 1 in the argument of the Bessel function in\nthis term. The solution of Eq. (24) with the initial condition\n\nthen reads\n\n1\nf \u0303G (x, b, Q0 ) = xg(x, Q20 )\n2\n\n(25)\n\n1\nf \u0303G (x, b, Q0 ) = Tg (b, Q)xg(x, Q2eff (b, Q)),\n2\n\n(26)\n\nwhere\nTg (b, Q) = exp\n\n(Z\n\nQ2\n\nQ20\n\ndq 2 \u03b1s (q 2 )\nq 2 2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\ndz [zPqg (z) + zPgg (z)[1 \u2212 J0 ((1 \u2212 z)qb)]]\n\nand Q2eff (b, Q) is obtained from the following implicit equation:\nZ Q2 2\nZ Q2 (b,Q) 2\neff\ndq \u03b1s (q 2 )\ndq \u03b1s (q 2 )\n=\nJ0 (qb).\nq 2 2\u03c0\nq 2 2\u03c0\nQ20\nQ20\n\n)\n\n(27)\n\n(28)\n\nThe function xg(x, Q2 ) is the integrated gluon distribution corresponding to the solution of\nequation (24) at b = 0 with the initial condition xg(x, Q20 ). At sufficiently large b the integral\non the right-hand side of Eq. (28) becomes negative, which gives Q2eff (b, Q) < Q20 , and the\neffective 'backward' evolution of the valence gluons gives a negative xg(x, Q2eff ) for sufficiently\nsmall x and for Q2eff (b, Q) sufficiently smaller than Q20 . This is the technical reason for the\nbehaviour seen in Fig. 1.\nThe mean squared transverse momentum for a given distribution is equal to\nR 2\nd kT k 2 fi (x, kT , Q)\nd/db2 fi (b, x, Q)\n2\n2\n,\n(29)\n= \u22124\nhkT (x, Q )ii \u2261 R 2 T\nfi (b, x, Q)\nd kT fi (x, kT , Q)\nb=0\nwhere the last equality follows from the expansion J0 (z) = 1 \u2212 41 z 2 + . . . . Through the use of\nthe decomposition (23) we may immediately write\nhkT2 (x, Q2 )ii = hkT2 iF + hkT2 (x, Q2 )ii,evol ,\nd/db2 F (b)\n,\nhkT2 iF = \u22124\nF (b)\nb=0\nd/db2 f \u0303i (b, x, Q)\nhkT2 (x, Q2 )ii,evol = \u22124\n,\nf \u0303(b, x, Q)\nb=0\n\n8\n\n(30)\n\n(31)\n\n\fwhich means that the total mean squared transverse momentum is the sum of the contribution\nfrom the profile F , which is constant and corresponds to the width at the initial scale Q = Q0 ,\nand the piece hkT2 ii,evol , which is due entirely to the evolution and is independent of the profile\nF . Because of these features we concentrate on hkT2 ievol in the discussion below.\n1/2\n\nIn Fig. 2 we show hkT2 ievol , plotted as a function of Q2 , for x=0.1 (top) and x=0.01 (bottom). The solid, dashed, and dot-dashed lines denote gluons, singlet, and non-singlet quarks,\nrespectively. Again, we clearly note the spreading effect with increasing Q2 . The effect is\n1/2\nstrongest for gluons, which at Q2 = 100 GeV2 achieve hkT2 ievol about 2.3 GeV for x = 0.1 and\n3.2 GeV for x = 0.01. However, even at moderate Q2 the spreading effect is sizeable, e.g. at\n1/2\nQ2 = 10 GeV2 and x = 0.01 we find hkT2 ievol = 1.5 GeV, 1.0 GeV, and 0.8 GeV for gluons,\nsinglet, and non-singlet quarks, respectively. The quoted numbers should be compared to the\ninitial spreading, hkT2 iF , which is typically assumed to be in the range of (0.5 \u2212 1 GeV)2 . We\nalso note from Fig. (2) that at larger values of x the quark singlet and non-singlet widths are\npractically equal, and at lower x the singlet distribution is somewhat wider.\n1/2\n\nWe also note a very sharp growth of hkT2 iG,evol at low Q and low values of x. This feature\nis an artifact of the valence-like gluon distributions at the reference scale Q20 .\nIn Fig. 3 we show the effect of the CCFM evolution on the kT distributions. We plot the\nunintegrated distributions fG,S,N S (x, kT , Q) in the pion for x = 0.1 and x = 0.01, and for four\nvalues of the hard scale Q2 varying from Q20 to Q2 = 100GeV2 . We have assumed here the\nGaussian profile,\nF (b) = exp(\u2212b2 k02 /4),\n(32)\nwhich leads to Gaussian kT distributions at the the initial scale, Q0 , proportional to exp(\u2212kT2 /k02 ).\nThe width parameter is taken to be k02 = 1GeV2 . The broadening of the distributions with\nincreasing magnitude of Q2 and decreasing x is clearly visible. It can also be seen that the effect\nis strongest for the gluons. Important property of the broadening is significant modification of\nthe Gaussian shape and development of the non-Gaussian long-range tail at large kT .\nStrong increase of the average transverse momentum squared with increasing Q2 does also\nindirectly affect Q2 dependence of unintegrated distributions at kT = 0. In order to understand\nthis dependence one may use the following approximate relation:\nfi (x, kT = 0, Q) \u223c\n\nxpi (x, Q2 )\n< kT2 (x, Q2 ) >i\n\n(33)\n\nwhere pi (x, Q2 ) are the integrated distributions. (Equation (33) follows from approximating\nin (16) the distributions f \u0304i (x, b, Q) by a Gaussian in b2 .) One expects that fi (x, kT = 0, Q)\nshould decrease at large Q2 due to strong increase of < kT2 (x, Q2 ) >i with Q2 that can be\nclearly seen from the from Figure (3), particularly for the gluons. In fact we show in the next\nSection that < kT2 (x, Q2 ) >i should increase as Q2 (modulo logarithmic effects). This increase is\nstronger than the potential increase of xpi (x, Q2 ) caused by scaling violations. Initial increase of\nfG (x, kT = 0, Q) with increasing Q2 for low values of Q2 , which can be clearly seen, particularly\n9\n\n\ffor low value of x = 0.01 is caused by the fact that at low Q2 < kT2 (x, Q2 ) >evol,G << k02 , i.e.\n< kT2 (x, Q2 ) >G \u223c k02 and so the Q2 dependence of fG (x, kT = 0, Q) is entirely driven by scaling\nviolations of xpg (x, Q2 ) = xg(x, Q2 ).\nFigures 4-6 show the results analogous to Figs. 1-3 for the case of the nucleon, where the\nGl\u00fcck-Reya-Vogt parameterisation of Ref. [35] is used at the initial scale of Q20 = 0.26 GeV2 .\nThe results are very similar to the case of the pion presented above. For the case of the\ntransverse-coordinate distributions we provide in Fig. 4 the results for both the u and d valence\nquarks. For the nonsinglet distributions the other figures show the results for the u valence\nquarks only, since the case of the d valence quarks is very similar.\n\n4\n\nEvolution of the x-moments\n\nThe evolution equation for the x-moments of the non-singlet distribution,\nZ 1\n2\n \u0303\nfNS (n, b, Q ) =\ndx xn\u22121 f \u0303NS (x, b, Q),\n\n(34)\n\n0\n\nis particularly simple. It immediately follows from Eq.

Next, we differentiate with respect to b2 at b = 0 on both sides of Eq. (36)\nand evaluate the z integral on the right-hand side.

Obviously, the moments for all values of n\nare growing with Q2 , which once again is a manifestation of the advocated spreading in kT .\nZ\n\nQ2\n\nThe analysis for the gluon and singlet quarks is more complicated due to mixing and is\ndiscussed in the Appendix. The evolution parts < kT2 (n, Q2 ) >i,evol , with i = G, S, are equal to\n<\n\nkT2 (n, Q2 )\n\n\u2032\nfi,evol\n(n, Q2 )\n>i,evol = \u22124\n,\nfi,evol (n, Q2 )\n\n(42)\n\n\u2032\nwith the functions fi,evol\n(n, Q2 ) and fi,evol (n, Q2 ) defined in Eqs. (58) and (72) in the Appendix.\nFrom those formulas and from equation (40) it follows that < kT2 (n, Q2 ) >i increases as Q2 ,\n\u2032\nmodulo logarithmic effects. This increase is caused by the fact that \u2212fi,evol\n(n, Q2 ) is found to\nincrease as Q2 modulo logarithmic effects caused by QCD scaling violations. Similar strong increase should also hold for \u2212d/db2 f \u0303i (b, x, Q)|b=0 controlling Q2 dependence of < kT2 (x, Q2 ) >i,evol\n\nThe results for the dynamically-generated root mean squared transverse momentum for the x\nmoments of the distributions in the pion, < kT2 (n, Q2 ) >i,evol , are shown in Fig. 7. For n = 0 only\nthe nonsinglet distribution is shown, since the gluon and singlet equations involve singularities\nand do not make sense in this case. The solid, dashed, and dot-dashed lines denote gluons,\nsinglet quarks, and non-singlet quarks. Again we use the initial GRS condition [34] at the scale\nQ2 = Q20 = 0.26 GeV2 . The analogous plot for the nucleon with the GRV parameterisation [35]\ngives identical results for the nonsinglet distributions, which follows immediately from Eq. (38)\nnot involving the initial values of the moments. For the gluons and singlet quarks the results\nfor the pion and the nucleon, although not strictly equal (see the Appendix), are practically\nidentical. The results displayed in Fig. 7 once again show the main observation of this paper,\nnamely, a large spreading of the distributions in process of the single-loop CCFM evolution.\n\n5\n\nParton-parton luminosity function\n\nThe knowledge of unintegrated distributions in the b representation is useful for calculations\nof the parton-parton luminosity function corresponding to the collision of parton a with the\nlongitudinal momentum fraction x1 and the transverse momentum fraction k1T with parton b\nwith the longitudinal momentum fraction x2 and the transverse momentum fraction k2T . The\nluminosity function is defined as [3]:\nZ 2\nd k1T d2 k2T\nLab (x1 , x2 , qT , Q) =\nfa (x1 , k1T , Q)fb (x2 , k2T , Q)\u03b4 (2) (k1T + k2T \u2212 qT ).\n(43)\n\u03c0\n11\n\n\fSubstituting in Eq. (43) the following representation of the \u03b4 function,\nZ\n1\n(2)\n\u03b4 (k1T + k2T \u2212 qT ) =\nd2 b exp[(k1T + k2T \u2212 qT )b],\n(2\u03c0)2\n\n(44)\n\nwe find that the integral defining the parton-parton luminosity in Eqn. (43) can be directly\nexpressed in terms of the unintegrated distributions in the b representation,\nZ \u221e\nLab (x1 , x2 , qT , Q) =\ndb2 fa (x1 , b, Q)fb (x2 , b, Q)J0 (bqT ).\n(45)\n0\n\nIn Fig. 8 we show the luminosity function corresponding to the valence u quark-gluon collisions. This quantity is relevant for the description of prompt photon production for which the\n\u221a\n\u221a\ndominant subprocess is u + g \u2192 u + \u03b3. We set Q = p\u03b3T and x1 = x2 = 2p\u03b3T / s where s is\n\u221a\nthe CM energy of the pp\u0304 collisions. The two curves correspond to s = 24.3GeV, p\u03b3T = 4GeV\n\u221a\nand s = 1800GeV, p\u03b3T = 10GeV. We can see that the luminosity function is increasing\nwith the energy, which simply reflects the increase of the unintegrated gluon distributions with\n\u221a\ndecreasing x = 2p\u03b3T / s.\n\n6\n\nSummary and conclusions.\n\nIn this paper we have performed an analysis of the unintegrated parton distributions fi (x, kT , Q)\nof the pion and nucleon using the CCFM equation in the single loop approximation. For the\nintegrated distributions this approximation is equivalent to the LO DGLAP evolution, and thus\nshould be adequate in the region of large and moderately small values of x (i.e. x > 0.01 or\nso). Important merit of the CCFM framework is the fact that once the input x and kT parton\ndistributions are provided at the reference scale Q20 , the CCFM evolution generates the x and\nkT distributions for arbitrary Q2 > Q20 and arbitrary values of kT , including the region of low\nkT down to the point kT = 0. This framework does therefore provide a useful extension of the\napproximate DGLAP - based treatment of the unintegrated distributions discussed in [2, 3].\nWe have extended the original CCFM equation by including the quarks and non-singular parts\nof the splitting functions and used the transverse-coordinate representation by introducing\nthe parton distribution f \u0304i (x, b, Q), related to the unintegrated parton distributions fi (x, kT , Q)\nthrough the Fourier-Bessel transform. The usefulness of this representation is related to the\nfact that the transverse coordinate b is conserved through the CCFM evolution in the single\nloop approximation. The average transverse momenta squared of the partons are determined\nby df \u0304i (x, b, Q)/db2 |b=0 . We have studied the impact of the QCD evolution on the shape of\nthe b profiles and on the broadening of the kT distributions. We have quantified increase\nof the average transverse momentum with increasing magnitude of the hard scale Q and/or\nwith decreasing x and we gave semianalytic insight into this increase. The average transverse\nmomenta squared of the partons were found to increase as Q2 with increasing Q2 , modulo\nlogarithmic effects related to the QCD evolution. We have also pointed out that the parton\n12\n\n\fdistributions in b representation determine the parton luminosity functions for fixed sum of the\ntransverse momenta of the partons. The unintegrated distributions fi (x, kT , Q) (or fi (x, b, Q))\nobtained in our paper can be used for the theoretical description of the processes which are\nsensitive to the transverse momenta of the partons.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was partially supported by the Polish Committee for Scientific Research (KBN)\ngrants no. 2P03B 05119 and 5P03B 14420.\n\nAppendix\nThe average value of the transverse momentum < kT2 (n) >i is given by\n< kT2 (n, Q2 ) >i = \u22124\n\nfi\u2032 (n, Q2 )\nfi (n, Q2 )\n\n(46)\n\nwhere\ndfi (n, b2 , Q2 )\n|b2 =0 ,\ndb2\nfi (n, Q2 ) = fi (n, b2 = 0, Q2 ),\n\nfi\u2032 (n, Q2 ) =\n\n(47)\n\nand fi (n, b2 , Q2 ) are the moment functions,\n2\n\n2\n\nfi (n, b , Q ) =\n\nZ\n\n1\n\ndxxn\u22121 f \u0304i (x, b, Q).\n\n(48)\n\n0\n\nThe index i corresponds to the gluon, quark singlet, or quark non-singlet distributions.

The gluon, f \u0303G , quark singlet, f \u0303S ,\nand quark non-singlet distributions, f \u0303N S , are plotted as functions of the transverse coordinate,\nb. The left and right parts are for x = 0.1 and x = 0.01, respectively. The solid lines correspond\nto the initial scale of the GRS parameterisation, Q2 = Q20 = 0.26 GeV2 [34], while the dashed,\ndash-dotted and dotted lines correspond to Q2 = 1 GeV2 , 10 GeV2 , and 100 GeV2 , respectively.\n\n19\n\n\fFigure 2: The dynamically-generated root mean-squared transverse momentum of unintegrated\npartonic distribution functions in the pion, plotted as a function of Q2 . The top and bottom\nparts correspond to x=0.1 and x=0.01, respectively. The solid, dashed, and dot-dashed lines\ndenote gluons, singlet quarks, and non-singlet quarks. The CCFM equations in the single-loop\napproximation with the initial GRS condition [34] at the scale Q2 = Q20 = 0.26 GeV2 are used\nfor the evolution.\n\n20\n\n\fFigure 3: Transverse-momentum parton distributions in the pion following from the solution\nof the CCFM equation in the single loop approximation. The gluon, fG , quark singlet, fS , and\nquark non-singlet distributions, fN S , are plotted as functions of the transverse momentum, kT .\nThe left and right parts are for x = 0.1 and x = 0.01, respectively. The solid lines correspond\nto the initial scale of the GRS parameterisation, Q2 = Q20 = 0.26 GeV2 [34], while the dashed,\ndash-dotted and dotted lines correspond to Q2 = 1 GeV2 , 10 GeV2 , and 100 GeV2 , respectively.\nParton distributions fi are in GeV\u22122 and transverse momentum kT is in GeV.\n\n21\n\n\fFigure 4: Same as Fig. 1 for the case of the nucleon, with the initial GRV parameterisation [35].\n\n22\n\n\fFigure 5: Same as Fig. 4 for the case of the nucleon, with the initial GRV parameterisation [35].\n\n23\n\n\fFigure 6: Same as Fig. 3 for the case of the nucleon, with the initial GRV parameterisation [35].\n\n24\n\n\fFigure 7: The dynamically-generated root mean squared transverse momentum of unintegrated\npartonic distribution functions in the pion corresponding to the x moments of the distributions,\nplotted as a function of Q2 for the moment index n = 0 (top), n = 1 (middle), and n = 2\n(bottom). The solid, dashed, and dot-dashed lines denote gluons, singlet quarks, and nonsinglet quarks. For n = 0 only the non-singlet distribution makes sense. The CCFM equations\nin the single-loop approximation with the initial GRS condition [34] at the scale Q2 = Q20 =\n0.26 GeV2 are used for the evolution. The analogous plot for the nucleon with the GRV\nparameterisation gives identical results for the nonsinglet distributions, and practically identical\nfor the gluons and singlet quarks.\n\n25\n\n\fFigure 8: The parton luminosity function corresponding to the valence u quark - gluon collisions\nplotted as the function of the transverse momentum qT equal to the vector sum of the transverse\nmomenta of the colliding partons. The value of the hard scale Q is set to the transverse\nmomentum p\u03b3T of the produced photon. The two curves correspond to two values of the total\n\u221a\n\u221a\np\u0304p CM energy s and different values of p\u03b3T : s = 24.3GeV, p\u03b3T = 4GeV (dashed line) and\n\u221a\n\u221a\ns = 1800GeV, p\u03b3T = 10GeV (full line). Results for s = 24.3GeV were multiplied by 10.\nThe parton luminosity function L is in GeV\u22122 and transverse momentum qT is in GeV.\n\n26\n\n\f"}
