The X-ray and radio emissions of GRB 021004 are also normal.\nSubject headings: gamma rays: bursts\n\nIntroduction\nInstruments aboard HETE II detected GRB 021004 at 4.50432 UT October 2002 (Shirasaki et al. 2002). Its bright fading optical afterglow was discovered by Fox et al. (2002)\nnine minutes after the burst and was soon followed worldwide with many telescopes, quite\ncontinuously during the first few days. The unprecedented density and precision of the data\nare reported in Fig. 1. The redshift of the GRB's host galaxy, z = 2.33, was first correctly\ndetermined by Chornock and Filippenko (2002) and confirmed by Salamanca et al. (2002),\nMirabal et al. (2002a), Savaglio et al. (2002), Castro-Tirado et al. (2002) and Matheson\net al. (2002). The AG's brightness allowed precise measurements of its temporal decline,\npolarization, spectrum, and spectral evolution. The optical light-curves deviate from the\nsmoothly steepening decline observed in most well-studied optical AGs. There are also \"unexpected\" features in the spectrum (e.g., Salamanca et al. 2002; Mirabal et al. 2002b)\n1\n\nPhysics Department and Space Research Institute, Technion, Haifa 32000, Israel\n\n2\n\nTheory Division, CERN, CH-1211 Geneva 23, Switzerland\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nand its evolution (e.g., Matheson et al. 2002). The spectrum of the radio to submillimeter\nwavelengths was also claimed to be \"unusual\" (Berger et al. 2002a).\nIn this letter we show that \u2013in the CB model\u2013 the only uncommon feature of GRB 021004\nis the precision of the measurements. Its most \"surprising\" properties were anticipated, in\nthe sense that there are \u2013again, in the CB model\u2013 precedents for all of them in past GRBs.\n\n1.\n\nThe Cannonball Model of GRBs\n\nThere is mounting evidence that long duration GRBs are produced in the explosions of\nsupernovae akin to SN1998bw (Galama et al. 1998), by the ejection of ordinary baryonic\nmatter \u2013essentially ionized Hydrogen\u2013 in the form of plasmoids or \"cannonballs\" (CBs), with\nvery highly relativistic Lorentz factors (\u03b3 \u223c 103 ) (Dar and De R\u00fajula 2000, 2001, Dado et\nal. 2002a,b,c,d) but otherwise similar to the ones observed in quasars (Marscher et al. 2002)\nand microquasars (e.g., Mirabel and Rodriguez 1994; Belloni et al. 1997; Rodriguez and\nMirabel 1999; Mirabel and Rodriguez 1999; Corbel et al. 2002, and references therein).\nIn the CB model (Dar and De R\u00fajula 2000, 2001, reviewed in De R\u00fajula 2002a,b) long\nduration GRBs and their AGs are produced in core collapse SNe by jets of highly relativistic\nCBs that pierce through the SN shell and the SN progenitor's \"wind\" ejecta. A CB is\nemitted, as observed in \u03bc-quasars, when part of an accretion disk falls abruptly onto the\nnewly-born compact central object. Crossing the circumburst shells with a large Lorentz\nfactor \u03b3, the surface of a CB is collisionally heated to keV temperatures and the radiation it\nemits when it reaches the transparent outskirts of the shells -boosted and collimated by the\nCB's motion- is a single \u03b3-ray pulse in a GRB. The cadence of pulses reflects the chaotic\naccretion and is not predictable, but the individual-pulse temporal and spectral properties\nare. A long list of general properties (Dar and De R\u00fajula 2001) of GRB pulses is reproduced\nin the CB-model, in which, unlike in the standard \"fireball\" models, the GRBs' \u03b3's have a\nthermal-bremsstrahlung -as opposed to synchrotron- origin3 .\nA CB exiting the circumburst shells soon becomes transparent to its own enclosed\nradiation. At that point it is still expanding and cooling adiabatically and by bremsstrahlung.\nThe hard bremsstrahlung spectrum dominates the very early X-ray AG (for a few tens of\nseconds) with a fluence of predictable magnitude decreasing with time as t\u22125 . All X-ray AGs\nare compatible in magnitude and shape with this prediction (Dado et al. 2002a).\n3\n\nIn this (Ghirlanda et al. 2002), as in the relevance of the viewing angle, or the explanation of AG\nfeatures by density inhomogeneities, the \"standard\" model is phagocytizing the CB-model's views.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nAfter the first tens of seconds, a CB's emissivity is dominated by synchrotron emission\nfrom the electrons that penetrate in it from the interstellar medium (ISM). Integrated over\nfrequency, this synchrotron emissivity is proportional to the energy-deposition rate of the\nISM electrons in the CB4 . These electrons are Fermi accelerated in the CB's tangled magnetic\nmaze to a broken power-law energy distribution with a \"bend\" energy equal to their incident\nenergy in the CBs' rest frame. In that frame, the electrons' synchrotron emission (prior to\nattenuation corrections) has an approximate spectral energy density (Dado et al. 2002b):\nFCB [\u03bd, t] \u2243 f0\n\n(p \u2212 2) \u03b3 2 np me c3 [\u03bd/\u03bdb ]\u22121/2\np\n,\n(p \u2212 1) \u03bdb 1 + [\u03bd/\u03bdb ](p\u22121)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere f0 is a normalization constant, p \u2248 2.2 is the spectral index of the Fermi accelerated\nelectrons\nprior to the inclusion of radiation losses, np is the ISM baryon density, \u03b3(t) =\np\n1/ 1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 (with \u03b2 = v/c) is the Lorentz factor of the CBs, and \u03bdb is the \"injection bend\"\nfrequency in the CB's rest frame5 ,\n\u03bdb \u2243 1.9 \u00d7 103 [\u03b3(t)]3\n\nh\n\ni1/2\nnp\nHz.\n10\u22123 cm\u22123\n\n(2)\n\nThe radiation emitted by a CB is Doppler-shifted and forward-collimated by its highly\nrelativistic motion, and redshifted by the cosmological expansion. A distant observer sees a\nspectral energy flux:\nFobs [\u03bd, t] \u2243\n\n(1 + z) \u03b4(t)3 R2 A(\u03bd, t)\nFCB [\u03bd \u2032 , t\u2032 ] ,\nD2L\n\n(3)\n\nwhere R is the radius of the CB (which in the CB model tends to a calculable constant value\nRmax of O(1014 ) cm, in minutes of observer's time), A(\u03bd, t) is the total extinction along the\nline of sight to the CB, DL (z) is the luminosity distance (we adopt H0 = 65 km/(s Mpc),\n\u03a9M = 0.3 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.7), \u03bd \u2032 = (1 + z) \u03bd/\u03b4(t), t\u2032 = \u03b4(t) t/(1 + z), and \u03b4(t) is the Doppler factor\nof the light emitted by the CB. In the domain of interest for GRBs, \u03b3 2 \u226b 1 and \u03b82 \u226a 1,\nwith \u03b8 the angle between the CB's direction of motion and the line of sight to the observer,\n\u03b4(t) \u2243\n\n2 \u03b3(t)\n.\n1 + \u03b82 \u03b3(t)2\n\n(4)\n\n4\n\nThe kinetic energy of a CB is mainly lost to the ISM protons it scatters; only a fraction \u2264 me /mp is\nre-emitted by the incorporated electrons, as the AG.\n5\n\nThis bend frequency is not the conventional \"cooling break\". It reflects an injection bend in the electron\nspectrum at the energy Eb = \u03b3(t) me c2 with which the ISM electrons enter the CB at a particular time in\nits decelerated motion (Dado et al. 2002b).\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nThe total AG is the sum over CBs (or large individual GRB pulses) of the flux of Eq. (3).\nFor an ISM of constant baryon density np , the deceleration of a CB results in a Lorentz\nfactor, \u03b3(t), that is given by (Dado et al. 2002a):\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n1\n2\n4\n\u03b3 = \u03b3(\u03b30 , \u03b8, x\u221e ; t) =\n\u03b8 + C\u03b8 +\n,\nB\nC\n\u0014\n\u00151/3\n2\n\u221a\nC \u2261\n,\nB2 + 2 \u03b86 + B B2 + 4 \u03b86\n3 \u03b82\n6ct\n1\n+\n+\n,\n(5)\nB \u2261\n3\n\u03b30\n\u03b30\n(1 + z) x\u221e\nwhere \u03b30 = \u03b3(0), and x\u221e = NCB /(\u03c0 R2max np ) characterizes the CB's slow-down in terms of\nNCB , its baryon number and Rmax , its radius (it takes a distance x\u221e /\u03b30 , typically of O(1)\nkpc, for the CB to slow down to half its original Lorentz factor).\nThe extinction, A(\u03bd, t) in Eq. (3), can be estimated from the difference between the\nobserved spectral index at very early time when the CBs are near the SN and that expected\nin the absence of extinction (Fobs \u221d \u03bd \u22120.5 , for \u03bd \u226a \u03bdb ). The CB model predicts -and\nthe data confirm- the gradual evolution of the effective optical spectral index towards the\nconstant value \u2248 \u22121.1 observed in all \"late\" AGs (Dado et al. 2002a). The \"late\" index is\nindependent of the attenuation in the host galaxy, since at t > 1 (observer's) days after the\nexplosion, the CBs are typically moving in the optically-transparent halo of the host galaxy.\nThe comparison of the predictions of Eq. (3) with the observations of optical, X-ray\nand radio light-curves and spectra is discussed in Dado et al. (2002a,b). The results -for\nall GRBs of known redshift- are very simple, satisfactory and parameter-thrifty. The CBmodel results concerning X-ray lines in GRB AGs are also exceptionally predictive, simple\nand encouraging (Dado et al. 2002e).\n\n2.\n\nGRB 021004 in the CB model\n\nFive properties of AGs in the CB model are particularly relevant to GRB 021004:\na. For most GRB optical AGs, good fits are obtained by approximating the ISM-density by\na constant (Dado et al. 2000a,b,c,d). One exception is the optical AG of GRBs \"caught\" at\nvery early times, when the CBs are still moving in a wind-generated density profile \u221d 1/r2 .\nIn the CB model the AGs' flux is proportional to the instantaneous swept-in electron density,\nimplying Fobs \u221d 1/t2 at very early times, as observed in GRB 990123 and GRB 991216.\nb. The achromatic \"bumps\" in the AGs of GRB 970508 and GRB 000301c are explained\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n(Dado et al. 2002a,b) by inhomogeneities in the density along the CBs' trajectory, better\nthan by gravitational lensing (Garnavich, et al. 2000). Density changes are expected within\nstar formation regions and upon exit from the superbubbles where most of the SNe take\nplace (Dado et al. 2000a).\nc. The data on past AGs were course enough or started late enough for the contributions\nof different CBs (which can often be resolved as individual pulses in the GRB phase) to\ncoalesce into an AG contribution describable as a single CB or a collection of similar ones.\nBut individual CBs have different properties, and may even be emitted at somewhat different\nangles, due to precession of the accretion disk relative to the rotation axis of the compact\nobject (Fargion and Salis 1995), as observed in the microquasar SS 433 (Margon 1984).\nd. The spectral shape of the AGs and their time-evolution, in particular their steepening\nat the time-varying frequency \u03bdb (t) of Eq.(2) -towards \u03bd \u22121.1 at late time- is very well\nsupported by the data (Dado et al. 2002b).\ne. The excess polarization of AGs above that induced by the ISM in our Galaxy may be\nlargely due to the host galaxy's ISM. In that case, it should be correlated with the extinction\nin the host and decline with time as the CBs move into the halo.\nThe \u03b3-ray light curve of GRB 021004 shows two prominent pulses separated by \u223c 30\nseconds (Shirasaki et al. 2002 and http://space.mit.edu/HETE/Bursts/GRB021004/). In\nthe CB model, these correspond to two dominant CBs. The good quality of the optical data\nfor GRB 021004 -and its double-humped \u03b3 burst- make irresistible the temptation to fit\nits broad-band AG light curves with two CBs, emitted in the same direction \u03b8 relative to\nthe observer6 , but with otherwise free parameters (normalization, \u03b30 and x\u221e ). We fix the\nspectral index p in Eq. (1) to the expected p = 2.2, assume a density profile of the form\nn(r) = n\u221e [(r0 /r)2 + 1], and fit simultaneously all the reported NIR, optical and radio data.\nNIR-Optical AG: In Fig. 1 we compare the results of the CB-model's fit to the data for the\nNIR-optical lightcurves. We have corrected for selective Galactic extinction in the direction\nof GRB 021004 (Schlegel et al. 1998): E(B \u2212 V) = 0.06 (attenuation magnitudes AU = 0.33,\nAB = 0.26, AV = 0.20, AR = 0.16, AI = 0.12, AJ = 0.08, AK = 0.04, and AH = 0.01, in\nthe various bands), and for absorption in the intergalactic space and in the host galaxy in\nthe B and U bands, AB = 0.25 and AU = 0.50 mag, estimated from the reported spectra of\nGRB 021004 (Moller et al. 2002; Matheson et al. 2002; Pandey et al. 2002; Bersier et al.\n2002; Holland, et al. 2002; Schaefer et al. 2002). The contribution from the host galaxy to\n6\n\nWe have also made fits with two different values of the emission angles \u03b8. They do not improve \u03c72\nsignificantly, and yield similar parameters: two different emission angles are not really necessary.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nthe late AG, normalized to 0.66 \u00b1 0.33 \u03bc-Jansky in the R band (Holland et al. 2002), was\nsubtracted. The results are very satisfactory though, as befits a rough approximation to a\nno-doubt very complex system, it is not perfect (\u03c72 = 3.5 per d.o.f. for 465 data points, if\nall reported statistical errors smaller than 0.05 mag are fixed to 0.05 mag, to account for\nuncertainties in calibration and in the conversion from magnitudes to Janskies). The broadband fitted parameters are, \u03b8 = 1.47 mrad, \u03b30 [1] = 1403, \u03b30 [2] = 1259 (implying \u03b40 [1] = 542,\n\u03b40 [2] = 576), x\u221e [1] = 25 kpc and x\u221e [2] = 620 kpc. To demonstrate the real quality of the\nfit, we have blown up the R-band results in Fig. 2. In the region between \u223c 0.5 and \u223c 5\ndays, the data \"wiggle\" by as much as 20% around the theoretical curve. It would be easy\nto correct for this by assuming similar deviations of the ISM density relative to the constant\nvalue adopted at large distances, clearly a moot exercise.\nOptical Polarization: The observed polarization of the optical AG of GRB 021004, which\nis consistent with that induced by the ISM in our Galaxy (Covino et al. 2002a,b; Rol et al.\n2002; Wang et al. 2002), implies that the polarization induced by the host's ISM is rather\nsmall and consequently the attenuation of the AG in the host must be small, consistent with\nthe CB model fit to the AG.\nX-ray AG: The Chandra observations by Sako et al. (2002) in the 2-10 keV domain, from\n0.867 to 1.874 days after burst, result in a spectrum dn/dE \u221d E\u22122.1\u00b10.1 and an AG decline\ndn/dt \u221d t\u22121.0\u00b10.2 , both consistent with the optical observations and with the CB-model's\nexpectations: dn/dE \u221d E\u22122.1 and, except at earlier times, an achromatic light-curve. In\nthis GRB, as in most others, the temporal and spectral behaviours are similar in the optical\nand X-ray bands, as shown in Fig. 1, but synchrotron emission alone underestimates the\nX-ray fluence (in this case, the optical to X-ray effective index is 0.2 units less steep than\nthe separate indices). The CB-model explanation is that in the X-ray domain not only\nsynchrotron radiation, but also Compton up-scattering and line-emission contribute to the\nflux (Dado et al. 2002a,b). There is nothing exceptional in the X-ray data for GRB 021004.\nRadio and Submillimeter AG: In Fig. 3 we compare the results of the CB-model's\nbroad-band fit to the radio and submillimeter data. Unlike the X-ray and optical AGs, the\nradio AGs are sensitive to self-absorption in the CBs, parametrized by a single absorption\nfrequency \u03bda (Dado et al. 2002b). The fit value for the CB that dominates the \"late\" radio\nAG is \u03bda [2] = 0.98 GHz, similar to those of other GRBs (Dado et al. 2002b). The fit in\nFig. 3 is very satisfactory, in particular in view of expected scintillations in the radio data.\nThe CB model is seen to correctly predict the early temporal increase (to be followed by a\nlater turn-over due to self absorption) and the spectral behaviour (F\u03bd \u223c \u03bd \u22121.13\u00b10.15 between\n1.43 GHz and 86 GHz, observed around 5 days after the burst) again akin to those of other\nGRBs: 991208 (Galama et al. 2000), 000926 (Harrison et al. 2001) and 000301c (Berger et\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nal. 2000). GRBs 021004 and 000301c also have very similar redshifts and fluences, dim host\ngalaxies, bumpy light-curves and analogous \"late\" optical AGs (GRB 000301c was optically\ndetected after \u223c 2 days by Fynbo et al. 2000).\nThe GRB proper. In the CB model (Dar and De R\u00fajula 2000), the rest-frame fluence\nof a CB viewed at a small \u03b8 is amplified by a huge factor, \u03b403 , due to the Doppler boost\nand relativistic beaming of the radiation (Shaviv and Dar 1995). In Dado et al. (2002a) we\ndeduced that the GRB photons of the GRBs of known redshift correspond to a total energy\nrelease in the CBs' rest system that is in a surprisingly narrow interval7 , 1044\u00b10.3 erg; and that\nthe spread in the \"equivalent spherical energies\" E\u03b3 around their mean, \u0112\u03b3 \u2248 4 \u00d7 1053 erg,\nis mainly due to the spread of their Doppler factors (deduced from the fits to their AGs)\naround their mean: \u03b4\u03040 \u2248 1100. For GRB 021004, \u03b40 \u2248 550 and the CB-model expectation\nis E\u03b3 \u2248 \u0112\u03b3 (\u03b40 /\u03b4\u03040 )3 \u2248 5 \u00d7 1052 erg, in agreement with the observed \u2248 4.8 \u00d7 1052 erg (we\nhave corrected the value of Lamb et al. (2002) to a redshift z = 2.335, from their adopted\nz = 1.6). The GRB of GRB 021004 is also entirely normal.\nSpectral Variability: The energy dependence of the injection bend implies that the optical\nspectra, Fobs [\u03bd, t], typically steepen in the first few days, as the bend frequency in the observer's frame \u03bdbobs (t) = \u03bdb (t) \u03b4(t)/(1+z) \"crosses\" the optical band (Dado et al. 2002b). Let\nobs\n\u03bbobs\nb (t) = c/\u03bdb (t). Given the parameters of our fit to the optical AG, we can predict, by use\nof Eqs.(1), the spectral energy density F\u03bb as a function of the ISM density np . The two CBs\nof GRB 021004 have similar \u03b30 and \u03b40 but different x\u221e : their time evolution and injection\nbends are different. The AG is dominated before and after t \u223c 0.5 days by one or the other\nCB, whose properties determine the \"early\" or \"late\" spectral evolution. The predictions for\nthe spectral ratio at the \"late\" times (t1 = 0.756 d, t2 = 2.786 d) measured by Matheson et\nal. (2002), are shown in Fig. 4. The upper panel is for n\u221e = 0.0018 cm\u22123, the density predicted from x\u221e [2] using the CB-model reference values (NCB = 6 \u00d7 1050 , Rmax = 2 \u00d7 1014 cm;\nobs\nDado et al. 2000a,b). For this n\u221e , \u03bbobs\nb (t1 ) = 3140 \u00c5 and \u03bbb (t2 ) = 8940 \u00c5.\nThe interpolation between the limiting behaviours at \u03bd \u226a \u03bdb and \u03bd \u226b \u03bdb could be more abrupt\nthan in Eq. (1). In the lower panel of Fig. 4 we illustrate the result for a sharp transition,\nfor which, with n\u221e = 0.0048 cm\u22123 , \u03bbobs\nb (t1 ) = 1932 \u00c5 (below the measured range) and\nobs\n\u03bbb (t2 ) = 5500 \u00c5, at which point F\u03bb changes from \u223c [\u03bb/\u03bbb ]\u22121.5 to \u223c [\u03bb/\u03bbb ]\u22120.9 , so that the\nratio shown in the figure is [\u03bb/\u03bbb (t2 )]\u22120.6 below 5500 \u00c5, and unity above.\n7\n\nGRBs in the CB model are much better standard candles than in the standard model (Frail et al. 2001).\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n3.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have shown that the CB-model's interpretation of all the data concerning GRB\n021004 is quite simple and very successful. The only novelty is that, relative to other GRB\nAGs, the optical data start very early and are so copious that a single CB would not fare well\nin explaining the light-curve shapes. Two large pulses are observed in the GRB's \u03b3-ray light\ncurve, enticing one to fit the rest of the data with two CB contributions. The results are\nexcellent and do not require new ad-hoc assumptions about the circumburst ISM density:\nGRB 021004 fits well and naturally along all other GRBs of known redshift.\nHaving described a relatively simple AG evolution with 8 parameters, we cannot claim\nthat they are all uncorrelated and well determined, although their use results in the impressive prediction for the spectral evolution reported in Fig. 4. We regard our results as an\nexistence proof of a very simple CB-model understanding of the bumpy AG of GRB 021004.\nIt is, as usual, instructive to compare the CB-model's results to those of the standard\n\"fireball\" scenarios. Two of the most striking differences are their degree of simplicity and\npredictive power; the explanation of the alleged X-ray lines in GRB afterglows is an extreme\ncase8 . The GRB under discussion is also in an extreme class: its standard explanations\n(Lazzati et al. 2002; Nakar et al. 2002; Heyl and Perna 2002) require model-dependent\ninversions of the observed light curves to obtain the input functions (the ISM-density or\nenergy-supply profiles and the extinction in the host) needed to \"predict\" the output functions (the light curves at different frequencies). The various quoted authors extract very\ndifferent input functions, thereby illustrating the limited \"posdictive\" power of fireballs. It\nwould be difficult, on these grounds, to falsify any model with that much freedom.\nFor a non-constant ISM density, short-time spectral variations and AG features are\nexpected in the CB model due to the local instantaneous dependence of F\u03bd and \u03bdb on the\ndensity, Eqs. (1,2). These are not expected in the standard models because signals emitted at\na fixed t from different portions of the fireball or firecone are observed at different times and\nwith different Doppler boosts, erasing all effects of width \u2206t \u226a t. Moreover, the standard\nAG fluence depends on the integrated density (up to time t): an abrupt rise of fluence such\nas that observed in GRB 970508 requires a different explanation (the AG is \"re-energized\",\nas in Piro et al. 1998). A similarly abrupt dip would be unexplainable.\nThe CB model is very modest in the adjectives that refer to GRBs. None of them\nis exceptional, not even the very energetic GRB 990123, nor 970508 with its peculiar AG\n8\n\nIn the CB model the existence and time-dependent energies of the lines are predicted, requiring no\ncustom-made metallic envelopes, nor any other ad-hoc assumption (Dado et al. 2002e).\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nshape, nor the extraordinarily close-by 980425. They are all associated with supernovae,\nseen when they are visible, not seen when they are not (Dado et al. 2002a). The explosions\nthat generate GRBs are not \"the biggest after the Big Bang\". The mechanism that begets\nGRBs is common: it takes place in quasars and microquasars as well. The model works very\nwell and is very predictive, thus falsifiable.\nAcknowledgment: This research was supported in part by the Helen Asher Space\nResearch Fund and by the VPR fund for research at the Technion.
