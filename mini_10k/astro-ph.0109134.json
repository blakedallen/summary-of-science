We find that all cosmological models fail to\nmatch our results if a constant mass\u2013to\u2013light ratio is assumed. In order for these models to match the\nfaint end of the luminosity function, a mass\u2013to\u2013light ratio decreasing with luminosity as L\u22120.5\u00b10.06 is\nrequired. For a \u039bCDM model, the mass\u2013to\u2013light function has a minimum of \u223c 100h\u22121\n75 in solar units in\nthe B-band, corresponding to \u223c 25% of the baryons in the form of stars, and this minimum occurs close\nto the luminosity of an L\u2217 galaxy. At the high-mass end, the \u039bCDM model requires a mass\u2013to\u2013light\nratio increasing with luminosity as L+0.5\u00b10.26 . This scaling behavior of the mass\u2013to\u2013light ratio appears\nto be in qualitative agreement with the predictions of semi-analytical models of galaxy formation. In\ncontrast, for the \u03c4 CDM model, a constant mass\u2013to\u2013light ratio suffices to match the high-mass end.\nWe also derive the halo occupation number, i.e. the number of galaxies brighter than L\u2217gal hosted in\na virialized system. We find that the halo occupation number scales non-linearly with the total mass of\nthe system, Ngal (> L\u2217gal ) \u221d m0.55\u00b10.026 for the \u039bCDM model.\nWe find a break in the power-law slope of the X-ray-to-optical luminosity relation, independent of the\ncosmological model. This break occurs at a scale corresponding to poor groups. In the \u039bCDM model,\nthe poor-group mass is also the scale at which the mass-to-light ratio of virialized systems begins to\nincrease. This correspondence suggests a physical link between star formation and the X-ray properties\nof halos, possibly due to preheating by supernovae or to efficient cooling of low-entropy gas into galaxies.\nSubject headings: cosmology: large-scale structure of the universe - cosmology: dark matter -\ngalaxies: clusters: general - galaxies: halos - galaxies: luminosity function, mass\nfunction - X-rays: general\nthe measured masses can have large errors. Second, the\ncatalogs may be incomplete in either mass or light. Furthermore, it is usually necessary to patch together results\nfrom several independent catalogs, each of which probes\ndifferent mass scales (e.g., galaxies, groups and clusters).\nIn this paper we take a different approach. We derive\nthe mass functions from theory and compare these with\nthe observed VSLF, solving for the unknown mass\u2013to\u2013\nlight ratio (\u03a5) as a function of the total mass or luminosity of the halo. The price paid in this approach is that\nthe mass function depends on the assumed cosmological\nmodel. The advantage over the conventional approach is\nthat we can simultaneously and seamlessly explore a wide\ndynamic range in mass and luminosity, free of systematics.\nThe \u03a5 function, which measures the efficiency with\nwhich the universe transforms matter into light, can thus\nbe used not only as a traditional estimator of the density\nparameter \u03a9m but also as a diagnostic tool for different\nmodels of galaxy formation.\nA closely related statistic, useful in modeling galaxy formation and clustering, is the halo occupation number, i.e.\nthe number of galaxies above some luminosity threshold\n(chosen to be the absolute magnitude of an L\u2217 galaxy)\nthat populate a virialized halo as a function of its total\nmass or luminosity.\n\n1. introduction\n\nOne of the major problems of cosmology is to determine\nthe connection between mass and light in the universe over\ndifferent scales. The abundance by mass of virialized dark\nmatter halos is a fundamental prediction of cosmological\nmodels (Press & Schechter 1974). Observationally, halos\nmust be identified with virialized galaxy \"systems\", ranging in size from single dwarf galaxies to rich clusters of\ngalaxies.\nThe masses, and hence the mass multiplicity functions,\nderived from cataloged systems are not robust, particularly for small systems such as poor groups which contain\nonly a few galaxies. In contrast, halo light is a fundamental observable obeying a robustly determined distribution function, the luminosity function of virialized systems\n(VSLF).\nIn a previous paper (Marinoni et al. 2001b, Paper V),\nwe measured the VSLF in the nearby Universe using an\nobjective catalog of virialized systems. In this paper we\nshow how the VSLF can be used to investigate scaling\nrelations between mass and light.\nThe direct approach to obtaining scaling relations between, for example, mass and light is to regress one parameter on the other. This direct approach has several weaknesses, however. As noted above, for low mass systems\n1\n\n\f2\nWithin the same framework, we can also investigate the\nemission properties of halos in different wavelength domains of the electromagnetic spectrum such as in the optical and X-ray bands. The sample of systems for which\nboth the optical and X-ray luminosities are well measured\nis still limited, and does not allow a reliable determination\nof the scaling of the X-ray to optical light ratio. However,\nby comparing statistically their luminosity distributions,\nwe can constrain the functional behavior of this ratio.\nThis paper is the sixth in a series (Marinoni et al. 1998,\nPaper I; Marinoni et al. 1999, Paper II; Giuricin et al. 2000,\nPaper III; Giuricin et al. 2001, Paper IV; Marinoni et al.\n2001b, Paper V) in which we investigate the properties of\nthe large-scale structures as traced by the NOG sample.\nThe outline of our paper is as follows: in \u00a72 we review and\nsummarize the determination of the observed luminosity\nfunction of virialized halos. In \u00a73 we compare our results\nwith the predictions of \u03c4 CDM and \u039bCDM models, as well\nas the predictions from semi-analytic models. In \u00a74, we\nmeasure the halo occupation number. In \u00a75 we examine\nthe relationship between the optical and X-ray properties\nin virialized systems. In \u00a76 we discuss in detail the resulting scaling relations between the properties of groups and\nclusters of galaxies. Results are summarized in \u00a77.\nThroughout this paper, the Hubble constant is taken to\nbe 75 h75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 and the recession velocities czLG\nare evaluated in the Local Group rest frame.\n2. the luminosity function of virialized halos\n\nIn paper V, we determined the luminosity function of\nvirialized systems using groups extracted from the NOG\ngalaxy catalog. The NOG sample (Marinoni 2001a) is\na statistically controlled, distance-limited (czLG \u22646000\nkm s\u22121 ) and magnitude-limited (B \u2264 14) complete sample of more than 7000 optical galaxies. The sample covers 2/3 (8.27 sr) of the sky (|b| > 20\u25e6 ), a volume of\n1.41 \u00d7 106 h375 Mpc\u22123 and has a redshift completeness of\n98%.\nFrom the NOG, three different \"virialized system\" samples were determined using groups selected by three different objective group-finding algorithms (Paper III). In\npaper V, we showed that the VSLF derived from these\ndifferent samples are consistent and hence that the VSLF\nis robust.\nIn order to recover accurately the absolute luminosity of\na given halo, we correct for both the integrated luminosity\nof galaxies below the magnitude limit of the sample and for\nthe completeness of subsamples of the halo catalog. Moreover, models to correct for the large-scale motions (Paper\nI) have been applied in order to improve the determination\nof the halo distances. The key steps of the reconstruction\nprocedure are shown in Fig. 1, focusing on several virialized systems in the Virgo region which are embedded in\nlower-density filamentary large-scale structure.\nIn Paper V, we found that the B-band luminosity function of the whole hierarchy of gravitationally bound systems, from single galaxies to rich clusters, was insensitive to the choice of the group-finding algorithms with\nwhich halos are selected, and was well described over\nthe absolute-magnitude range \u221224.5 \u2264 Ms + 5 log h75 \u2264\n\u221218.5 by a Schechter function (Schechter 1976) with \u03b1s =\n\u22121.4 \u00b1 0.03, Ms\u2217 \u2212 5 log h75 = \u221223.1 \u00b1 0.06 and \u03c6\u2217s =\n\n4.8 \u00d7 10\u22124 h375 Mpc\u22123 or by a double power law: \u03c6pl (Ls ) \u221d\nL\u22121.45\u00b10.07\nfor Ls < Lpl and \u03c6(Ls ) \u221d L\u22122.35\u00b10.15\nfor\ns\ns\nLs > Lpl with Lpl = 8.5 \u00d7 1010 h\u22122\nL\n,\ncorresponding\nto\n\u2299\n75\nMs \u2212 5 log h75 = \u221221.85. The characteristic luminosity\nof virialized systems, Lpl , is \u223c 3 times brighter than that\n(L\u2217gal ) of the luminosity function of NOG galaxies.\n3. the mass\u2013to\u2013light ratio of virialized systems\n\n3.1. Introduction\nIn order to compare observational data with theoretical predictions, the traditional approach has been to estimate the halo mass of groups and clusters directly from\nthe data, using, for example, velocity dispersions of galaxy\nmembers (Carlberg et al. 1996; Girardi et al. 1998), X-ray\ngas temperatures (David, Jones, & Forman 1996; Lewis\net al. 1999), and gravitational lensing (Smail et al. 1997,\nAllen 1998).\nThe application of these methods is reasonably straightforward for rich clusters of galaxies but is more problematic for poor groups, due to their low X-ray surface brightness and the poor sampling of optical dynamical mass estimators (see, e.g., Zabludoff & Mulchaey 1998, Mahdavi et\nal. 1999). Consider, for example, a system composed of a\nfew elements selected from a magnitude-limited survey. In\nthis case one will miss faint members that do not satisfy\nselection criteria. The contribution of faint members to\nthe total luminosity of the system is negligible small, and\ncan easily be corrected (see Paper V). In contrast, these\nfaint galaxies are important dynamical probes of the gravitational potential well, and their omission can translate\ninto a serious bias in the estimated mass, particularly if\ngalaxies of different luminosities are clustered in different\nways (Park et al. 1994; Giuricin et al. 2001). Moreover\none can construct a completeness function and than derive\na differential distribution function for the light emitted by\nvirialized systems, while the construction of a similar completeness function involving dynamical estimators (velocity dispersion for example) is very problematic (Borgani\net al. 1997). Thus, the luminosity function of virialized\nsystems is more robust on group scales than is the mass\nfunction derived using projected velocity dispersions.\nIn this paper, following Cavaliere, Colafrancesco &\nScaramella (1991) and Moore, Frenk, & White (1993,\nMFW), we explore an alternative approach to determining the mass\u2013to\u2013light ratio over a range of scales including\nboth poor and rich systems. Specifically, we compare the\nrobust observationally-determined luminosity function of\nsystems to theoretically-determined mass functions.\n3.2. Theory\nThe differential mass function of virialized systems n(m)\ncan be calculated, for a given cosmological model, via the\nPress-Schechter formalism (Press & Schechter 1974, hereafter PS; Schaeffer & Silk 1985; Bower 1991; Bond et al.\n1991; Cavaliere, Colafrancesco, & Scaramella 1991; Lacey\n& Cole 1993; Monaco 1998), or more accurately, through\nN-body simulations (Efstathiou & Rees 1988; Lacey &\nCole 1994; Governato et al. 1999; Jenkins et al. 2001). The\ncomparison with N-body simulations reveals that the PS\nmass function provides a reasonably accurate description\nof the abundance of virialized halos on group and cluster\nscales although it tends to overpredict\n\n\f3\n\nFig. 1.- Upper left: Density (\u03b4=1.5) distribution of NOG galaxies smoothed using a Gaussian window function with smoothing\nlength Rs = 200 km s\u22121 .

The parameter \u03b4c is only weakly-dependent on\nmatter density parameter \u03a9m and the cosmological constant \u03a9\u039b (varying by less than 0.02 for flat models with\n\u03a9m > 0.1, see Fig 1. of Eke, Cole, & Frenk 1996), and\nso has been set to its Einsten-de Sitter cosmology value\n1.686.\nThe dimensionless power spectrum (\u2206(k)\n\u2261\nV (2\u03c0 2 )\u22121 k 3 |\u03b4k |2 in the linear regime is given by the analytic approximation of Bond & Efstathiou (1984)\nn(m)dm =\n\nAk 4\n\u2206(k) = h\ni2/\u03bd\n1 + [aq + (bq)3/2 + (cq)2 ]\u03bd\n\nFig. 2.- The NOG and CfA system LFs are compared with the\nluminosity distribution predicted using the Press-Schechter function and a constant mass\u2013to\u2013light ratio.

For\neach model we show the constant mass\u2013to\u2013light ratio adopted.

The parameter \u0393 = \u03a9m h100 (if\nwe neglect the effect of baryons) determines the shape, and\nthe normalization is determined e.g. by Cosmic Microwave\nBackground fluctuations or by fixing the rms fluctuations\non a scale of 8h\u22121\n100 Mpc, \u03c38 .\n\n3.3. Results\nFigure 2 shows the PS-predicted luminosity functions\nobtained assuming constant mass\u2013to\u2013light ratio for four\ndifferent cosmological models: Standard CDM (\u03a9m = 1,\n\u03a9\u039b = 0, H0 = 50 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03c38 = 0.51), \u039bCDM\n(\u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, H0 = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03c38 = 0.9),\n\u03c4 CDM (\u03a9m = 1, H0 = 50 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03c38 = 0.51, \u0393 =\n0.21) and Open CDM (\u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0, H0 = 70 km s\u22121\nMpc\u22121 , \u03c38 = 0.85). These models are described in detail\nby Jenkins et al. (1998) and are normalized adopting the\nvalues for the fluctuations in an 8 h\u22121\n100 Mpc sphere, \u03c38 ,\nprescribed by Eke, Cole, & Frenk (1996) from their analysis of the local cluster X-ray temperature function.\nThe NOG VSLF and the corresponding MFW results\nare shown in Figure 2. The latter is represented by a\nhatched region, which shows how the VSLF varies if the\noverdensity contrast used in identifying groups is varied\nfrom 50 to 300.\n\nThe friends-of-friends grouping algorithm used to define\nthe groups and hence the VSLF requires that the local density contrast at the edge of a group be greater than some\nlimiting threshold \u03b4n\nn\u0304 (see the discussion in \u00a72). If we assume a spherical halo with a singular isothermal density\nprofile n(r) \u221d r\u22122 , this local density threshold corresponds\n\u03b4n\nto a mean overdensity h \u03b4n\nn\u0304 i = 3 n\u0304 where the average is\nperformed over the typical separation of group members\n(virialization region). Thus, if galaxy biasing is negligible,\nfor our grouping algorithms, this implies a value which is\nclose to the mean overdensity of nearly 180 predicted for a\ntop-hat spherical collapse in the case of \u03a9m = 1 (see Eke,\nCole, & Frenk 1996 for values in different cosmologies).\nCole & Lacey (1996) found that the virialized regions\nof N-body halos are reliably identified using the percolation method and a local density threshold parameter of\nnearly 60. Using this limiting density contrast, they are\nable to reproduce the bulk properties of virialized structures (in particular the virial mass) and concluded that the\ncloseness to global virial equilibrium of the identified Nbody halos depends rather weakly on the adopted limiting\nthreshold. Moreover, as noted by Diaferio et al. (1999),\nthe average luminosities of groups objectively identified\nfrom a redshift survey with typical friends-of-friends parameters are in agreement with those of groups extracted\nfrom real-space simulations. Thus, we can use our VSLF\nfor a meaningful comparison with the PS predictions.\nFigure 2 indicates that, in agreement with previous results, all models fail to describe the observed faint-end\nslope.\n\n\f5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n8\n\nFig. 3.- The NOG and CfA system LFs are compared with the luminosity distribution predicted using the Press-Schechter function.\nThe LF in the \u03c4 CDM and \u039bCDM scenarios are computed for constant mass\u2013to\u2013light ratios (\u03a5 = 330h75 \u03a5\u2299 and \u03a5 = 96h75 \u03a5\u2299 respectively) and also (heavy lines) using the piecewise mass\u2013to\u2013light\nratios given in the figure. The hatched region indicates how the LF\nused in identifying groups is\nvaries if the overdensity criterion \u03b4n\nn\nvaried from 50 to 300.\n\nMore interestingly, several models (\u039bCDM and OCDM)\nfail to reproduce the bright end of the LF, if a constant\nmass\u2013to\u2013light ratio is assumed.\nWe can turn this problem around, and solve for the\nmass\u2013to\u2013light function, \u03a5(m), required to fit the observed VSLF. We assume that there is a monotonic relation between the mass and light of virialized systems,\ni.e. Ls = f (m) with no scatter.\nIt is possible to obtain an exact numerical solution by\nnoting that the \u03a5 function is defined implicitly by the\nrequirement that the number density of systems above\nwith masses greater than mass m must be the same as\nthe number density of systems with luminosities greater\nthan Ls = f (m),\nNs [> Ls = f (m)] = Ns (> m)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Ns (> Ls ) is given by the appropriate integral over\nthe VSLF\nZ \u221e\n\u03c6(Ls )dLs\n(4)\nNs (> Ls ) =\nLs\n\nand Ns (> m) is the corresponding integral over the PS\nmass function.\nThe LF integral can be obtained analytically, but the\nPS mass function integral must be solved numerically. The\nmass\u2013to\u2013light ratio is then given by\n\u03a5=\n\nm\nf (m)\n\n(5)\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nFig. 4.- Mass\u2013to\u2013light ratio as a function of luminosity for the\n\u039bCDM and \u03c4 CDM models. The thin solid and dotted lines indicate\nthe mass\u2013to\u2013light ratios for the piecewise models shown in Fig. 3 for\nthe \u039bCDM and \u03c4 CDM models respectively, whereas the thick lines\nare the exact solutions obtained by solving eq. 3. The dashed line\nindicates the critical value of the mass\u2013to\u2013light ratio. The hatched\nregion represents extrapolation to regions not covered by our data.\n\nIf we assume that mass and light are simply related via\na power law expression \u03a5 \u221d L\u03b3s , the halo luminosity function assumes the simple analytical form\n\u03c6(Ms ) \u221d mn(m)(1 + \u03b3)\n\n(6)\n\nThe predicted VSLFs obtained fitting \"piecewise\" \u03a5\nfunctions are shown in Figure 3 for the \u03c4 CDM and \u039bCDM\nmodels, which are used here as our reference models.\nIn Table 2, we give the masses assigned to luminous\nsystems for the numerical solution of the \u03a5 function. In\nFigure 4, the piecewise and numerical solutions for \u03a5 are\nplotted as a function of luminosity. The result is that, for\nboth models, \u03a5 must go approximately as Ls\u22120.5\u00b10.06 on\nsmall scales. Interestingly, this behavior agrees with the\ndirect determinations of \u03a5 derived for spiral galaxies from\nthe analysis of their rotation curves and for ellipticals from\na variety of tracers of galactic gravitational field (see the\nreview by Salucci & Persic 1997).\nThe \u03a5 function reaches a minimum at a luminosity of\napproximately 1010.5 h\u22122\n75 L\u2299 , which corresponds roughly\nto L\u2217gal . Then it remains quite flat over \u223c 1 dex in\nluminosity. The behavior at the bright end is modeldependent: for the \u03c4 CDM model, \u03a5 must remain constant (m \u221d Ls1\u00b10.1 ), whereas for the \u039bCDM model it must\nincrease with luminosity as L0.5\u00b10.26\nfrom the scale of\ns\ngalaxy groups (m \u223c 1013 m\u2299 h\u22121\n75 ) to that of rich clusters\n( \u223c 1015 m\u2299 h\u22121\n75 ).\n\n\f6\n\nFig. 5.- Upper: the NOG VSLF (points with \u00b11\u03c3 error bars)\nis shown in comparison with the semi-analytic prediction of Benson et al. (2000). Results from their \u03c4 CDM and \u039bCDM models are\nplotted with short-dashed lines and solid lines respectively. Lower:\nmass\u2013to\u2013light ratios from Fig. 4 (smooth curves) are compared to\nthose derived by Benson et al. (curves with error bars).\n\nRecall that our mass\u2013to\u2013light ratios are based on the PS\nmass functions. If, as mentioned above, the PS prescription underestimates the abundance of high-mass objects,\nthe true scaling at the high-luminosity end is likely to be\nsomewhat steeper than found above. This would also be\ntrue if we used a lower value \u03b4c = 1.3 in the PS mass function, as might be expected for a non-spherical collapse for\nbound structures.\n\nlocity dispersion. This result would imply that \u03a5 increases\nwith cluster mass, if the shape of the luminosity function\nof cluster galaxies were independent of cluster mass.\nThese results are in agreement with the mass-to-light\nfunction of the \u039bCDM model, but not with that of the\n\u03c4 CDM model.\nOn the largest scales, the behavior of the mass-to-light\nfunction is less clear. Virialized objects of supercluster\nmass are expected to be extremely rare - there are certainly none in the NOG volume. It is possible to obtain\ndirect estimates of the global mass-to-light ratio can obtained from studies of peculiar velocities, which probe deviations from the uniform expansion of the Universe. Note\nthat the peculiar velocity of a given galaxy is generated by\na large number of massive halos over a range of distances,\nin both overdense and underdense regions. Thus the massto-light ratio determined by such studies is an average over\na range of mass scales. Hudson (1993, 1994) studied the\ndensity field and peculiar velocity field in a volume very\nsimilar to the NOG. He assumed a constant mass-to-light\nration for all systems and found that the average mass-tolight ratio of optical galaxies was 30% of the mass-to-light\nratio of a critical density Universe, if galaxies are unbiased tracers of the mass. It would be interesting to see\nhow these conclusions would be altered if one adopted the\nmass-to-light function found here for the \u039bCDM model.\nOur results can also be used to determine the efficiency\nof star formation, namely the fraction of all baryonic material which has turned into stars. We can convert our\n\u03a5 function into a stellar-to-total mass ratio if we assume\na stellar mass-to-light ratio averaged over spheroids and\ndisks, of \u03a5star = 3.4\u03a5\u2299 (Fukugita, Hogan & Peebles, 1998)\nin the B-band. Near the minimum of the \u03a5 function, this\nyields a mass fraction of stars, Mstar /Mtot \u223c 0.035h\u22121\n75 .\nThe mass fraction in stars can then be converted into the\nfraction of baryons in stars, if we assume that the baryonicto-total mass fraction in virialized systems is the same as\nthe global value, \u03a9baryon /\u03a9m . Using \u03a9baryon = 0.022h\u22122\n100\nfrom Netterfield et al. (2001), we obtain the stellar-tobaryonic fraction\n\n3.4. Discussion\nIt is interesting to compare the \u03a5 functions derived in\nthe previous subsection with values found via direct mass\nestimates. As discussed above, these direct methods are\nproblematic for low mass systems such as single galaxies\n(because the full extent of the dark matter halo is not\nprobed) or poor groups (because of the small numbers\nof dynamical test particles). The \u03a5 values found in the\nliterature are consistent with the range \u223c 100h75\u03a5\u2299 to\n\u223c 300h75 \u03a5\u2299 spanned by the \u039bCDM and \u03c4 CDM models\nconsidered here.\nFor high masses, we can compare our results with the\nscaling behavior of \u03a5 obtained via direct determinations of\nthe virial masses of galaxy clusters. Schaeffer et al. (1993)\nfound that \u03a5V \u221d L0.3\nV . Girardi et al. (2000) analyzed 105\n.\nrich clusters and found \u03a5BJ \u221d L0.2\u22120.3\nBJ\nThey also noted that a variation of \u03a5 with scale could\nnot be explained by a higher fraction of spirals in poorer\nclusters, thus suggesting that a similar result would also\nbe found by using R-band galaxy magnitudes. Carlberg\net al. (1996) found that the number of bright galaxies per\nunit mass is systematically lower in cluster with higher ve-\n\nMstar /Mbaryon \u223c 0.26\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03a5\n100h75\u03a5\u2299\n\n\u0013\u22121 \u0012\n\n\u03a9m\n0.3\n\n\u0013\n\nh75\n\n(7)\n\nThus in those dark matter halos which have luminosities in\nthe range 1 \u2212 10L\u2217gal , masses in the range 1012 \u2212 1013 m\u2299\nand where \u03a5 \u223c 100h75 \u03a5\u2299 , \u223c 25% of the mass is converted into stars. This is considerably more efficient than\nthe global stellar fraction of <\n\u223c 10% (Fukugita et al. 1998).\nFor the \u039bCDM model, the mass-to-light-ratio increases\nto \u03a5 = 350h75\u03a5\u2299 at cluster masses \u223c 5\u00d71014h\u22121\n75 m\u2299 .\nAt this mass, the star formation efficiency has dropped\nto 7.4%. If we also allow for the redder population of\nsuch systems, and assign a higher stellar M/LB = 4.5\n(Fukugita et al. 1998), the star formation efficiency would\nbe 10%. This is in agreement with the results of Balogh et\nal. (2001). For the \u03c4 CDM model, the mass-to-light ratio\nis \u223c 330h75 \u03a5\u2299 for all systems with masses greater than\n\u22121\n1013 h75\nm\u2299 , and in this mass range the star formation efficiency would be \u223c 25%.\n\n\f7\n\n1000 500\n\n100\n\n50\n\n10\n\nis known, one can use the well-understood clustering of halos to obtain the clustering of galaxies (Neyman, Scott and\nShane 1953; Kauffmann et al. 1999; Diaferio et al. 1999;\nBenson et al. 2000; Seljak 2000; Peacock and Smith 2000;\nScoccimarro et al. 2001; Benson 2001).\nIn Fig. 6, we plot the number of galaxies with luminosity greater than L\u2217gal as a function of the corrected halo\nluminosity and of the total halo mass derived under the\nassumption of a \u039bCDM cosmogony (\u00a73). Note that NOG\nsample is complete for Lgal > L\u2217gal (see Fig. 6 of Paper\nV) and no luminosity selection effects are polluting the\nobserved trend. Note that, by definition, we are only considering the high-luminosity (Lgal > L\u2217gal ) end of the \u03a5\nfunction. We find that the number of galaxies above the\nL\u2217gal luminosity threshold, scales with the total luminosity\nof the system as follows\n!0.83\u00b10.25\nLs\n\u2217\nNgal (> Lgal ) = (0.26 \u00b1 0.02)\n,\n(8)\nL\u2217gal\n\n5\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n-25\n\n-24\n\n-23\n\n-22\n\n-21\n\nFig. 6.- The number of galaxies with luminosity greater than\nL\u2217gal hosted in a halo is plotted as a function of the system luminosity.

The mass scale is obtained using\nthe mass\u2013to\u2013light ratio derived in a \u039bCDM cosmogony in \u00a74. Also\nshown the best fitting curve as determined in equation refnl.\n\nFinally, we can compare our VSLF to the predictions of\nsemi-analytic models, such as those of Benson et al. (2000).\nIn Figure 5, we show our LF and that of MFW in comparison with the predictions of their \u039bCDM and \u03c4 CDM models. Benson et al. constrained their models to match the\namplitude of the ESP galaxy LF in the BJ -band (Zucca et\nal. 1997) at their L\u2217gal . Their \u03c4 CDM model is quite a poor\nfit, failing to match the slope of our VSLF at intermediate luminosities and predicting too many low-luminosity\nobjects. Their \u039bCDM model provides a marginal fit to\nour results: the bright-end slope is correct, although the\npredicted LF slope in the range of groups is somewhat too\nsteep. This arises because their \u03a5 function increases as\nm0.3 between masses of 1012 m\u2299 and 1014 m\u2299 , whereas we\nfind that the behavior of \u03a5 is quite flat in this range (see\nFig. 4). An increase in \u03a5 from the scales of large galaxies up to clusters is also predicted by the galaxy formation models of Kauffmann et al. (1999), with \u03a5B \u221d m0.2\nover the range 1012 m\u2299 < m < 1015 m\u2299 for both their\n\u039bCDM and \u03c4 CDM models. This is similar to that found\nby Benson et al., and suggests that the Kauffmann et al.\nVSLF would be qualitatively similar to that of Benson et\nal. The \u03a5 functions obtained from the semi-analytic models of Somerville et al. (2001) also increase with increasing\nmass, however their \u03a5 values are larger than those of Benson et al. and are thus in poorer agreement with those\nderived here.\n4. halo occupation numbers\n\nFor many purposes, it is important to know the number\nof galaxies which populate a given halo. Once this function\n\nfor Ms \u2212 5 log h75 < \u221221. Using the mass\u2013to\u2013light ratio\nderived in section \u00a73 we can derive the dependence of the\nnumber of objects residing within halos in terms of the\nhalo mass and of the specific cosmological model adopted.\nWe find that in a \u039bCDM and \u03c4 CDM cosmogonies, the\nscaling of the halo occupation number with mass is given\nby the following expressions\n\u0012\n\u00130.55\u00b10.26\nm\n4/3\n\u22128\n\u2217\nNgal (> Lgal ) = 6.3h75 * 10\n(9)\nm\u2299\n12 \u22121\nfor m >\n\u223c 5\u00d710 h75 m\u2299 and\n\nNgal (>\n\nL\u2217gal )\n\n= 4.2h75 * 10\n\n\u221212\n\n\u0012\n\nm\nm\u2299\n\n\u00130.83\u00b10.33\n\n(10)\n\n13 \u22121\nfor m >\n\u223c 10 h75 m\u2299 , respectively.\nPeacock and Smith (2000) performed a similar analysis\nusing CfA (Ramella, Pisani & Geller 1997) and ESO Slice\nProject groups (Ramella et al. 1999). Their Figure 6 suggests power-law exponents of \u223c 0.55 and \u223c 0.7, for \u039bCDM\nand \u03c4 CDM models respectively, in good agreement with\nour results.\n\n5. the relation between optical and x-ray\n\nproperties in virialized systems\nHaving derived the functional form of the optical luminosity distribution of virialized systems, we now investigate the relation between optical and X-ray emission properties in galaxy systems. The techniques involved are the\nsame as those developed in section \u00a72. The general problem of deriving the functional form LX = f (L), relating\nthe optical and the X-ray luminosities, can be formulated\nusing the following differential equation\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 LX = f (Ls )\n(11)\n\uf8f3 df (Ls ) = \u03c6(Ls )\ndLs\n\u03c6(LX )\n\nwhere \u03c6(Ls ) is the optical LF of systems emitting in the\nX-ray band with a luminosity distribution \u03c6X (LX ), and\nwhere LX = f (Ls ) is the initial condition, which can be\ndetermined from the data.\n\n\f8\n\nFig. 7.- Upper: the local X-ray luminosity functions in four\ndifferent bands are compared over a luminosity range that describes both groups (faint end) and clusters (bright end). The\nshape of the NOG VSLF is shown for comparison. Lower: the\nratio f between the logarithms of the four X-ray luminosity functions and a power law expression of parameters \u03b1X = \u22121.85 and\n\u03c6\u2217X = 4 * 10\u22127 M pc\u22123 (1044 ergs\u22121 )\u03b1X \u22121 is shown as a function of\nluminosity.\n\nWe assume that all virialized systems detected in the optical also radiate in X-rays. Their optical LF is a Schechter\nfunction whose parameters (\u03c6\u2217s , \u03b1s , Ms\u2217 ) are known over\nthe luminosity range \u221218 < Ms \u2212 5 log h75 < \u221225 (\u00a73 and\nFig. 7). The XLFs in various bands are given by Ebeling\net al. (1997).\nThe optical emission is expected to be connected with\nthe X-ray emission under the standard assumption that\nthe same gravitational potential shapes the gas density\ndistribution as well as the galaxy distribution (Cavaliere\n& Fusco-Femiano 1976). We can gain some insights into\nthe optical-to-X-ray luminosity ratio making some approximations. Fig. 7 shows that \u03c6X (LX ), for both groups and\nclusters, can be well approximated, in almost all the Xray bands, by a single power-law expression \u03c6X (LX ) =\n\u03c6\u2217X L\u03b1X . In particular, in the bolometric and 0.1-2.4 keV\nbands, the local XLFs of Ebeling et al. (1997) are very\nwell approximated (and extrapolated into the group domain) by the following fitting parameters \u03c6\u2217X \u223c 4 * 10\u22127\nMpc\u22123 (1044 erg s\u22121 )\u03b1X \u22121 and \u03b1X \u223c 1.85. In this case,\nthe particular solution of eq. 11 is simple and can be expressed by the following analytical formula\n1\nh \u0010\nn\n\u0010\nLs \u0011\nLs \u0011io \u03b2X\nLX = f (Ls )\u03b2X \u2212 C\u03b2X \u0393i \u03b2s ,\n\u2212 \u0393i \u03b2s ,\nL\u2217\nL\u2217\n(12)\nwhere C = \u03c6\u2217s /\u03c6\u2217X , \u03b2 = 1 + \u03b1 (for s and X subscripts) and\n\u0393i is the incomplete gamma function. However, if we integrate numerically the differential equation 11, we obtain\nthe result plotted in Fig. 8.\n\nFig. 8.- The relation between optical (Ls ) and X-ray (LX ) luminosities as determined in eq. 12 is shown together with the observed\nluminosities of Abell clusters. The straight line is the scaling relation predicted in a \u039bCDM universe using the optical (this paper)\nand the X-ray (Ledlow et al. 1999) mass\u2013to\u2013light ratios with arbitrary normalization. The thick solid line is the exact solution and\nthe dotted line is the analytical solution of eq. 12. The hatched\nregion corresponds to the errors in the LX \u2212 Ls relation obtained\nfrom the errors in the respective luminosity functions.\n\nIn order to test the solution and determine the normalization constant, we have used a sample of Abell clusters\nfor which both the optical blue magnitudes and the Xray luminosities in the 0.1-2.4 keV band are known. The\nlargest local samples of X-ray luminosities compiled to\ndate are the X-ray Brightest Abell Cluster Sample XBACS\n(Ebeling et al. 1996) and the Brightest Cluster Sample\n(BCS) (Ebeling et al. 1998). We found that 28 XBACS\nand 3 BCS clusters also have estimated BJ luminosities\n(Girardi et al. 2000). At the low-luminosity end we used\na sample of compact groups whose luminosities in the Xray (bolometric) and optical (blue) passbands are given\nby Ponman et al. (1996) and Hickson et al. (1992) respectively. In order to reduce observational errors, the initial\ncondition has been determined by averaging the luminosities of the four optically brightest clusters in the sample.\nThe overall agreement between our prediction and the\ndata is shown in Fig. 8. Note that the Girardi et al. (2000)\ndata shown here are at the tail of our optical VSLF. Of\nparticular interest is the apparent break in the power-law\nbehavior at Ms = \u221221 + 5 log h75 , LX \u223c 1042 erg s\u22121 h\u22122\n75 .\nFainter than this break, the numerical solution is well approximated by LX \u221d L1.5\ns , whereas in the brighter regime,\nboth numerical and analytic solutions are well approximated by LX \u221d L3.5\ns .\n6. scaling relations in groups and clusters of\n\ngalaxies\n\n\f9\nWhen considering X-ray properties, as well as mass-tolight ratios, it is convenient to separate poor systems, by\nwhich we mean systems with one or a few L\u2217gal galaxies\n(poor groups), from rich systems (rich groups and clusters). We define the former to be those systems with\n\u221221 > Ms \u2212 5 log h75 > \u221223 or LX < 1042 erg s\u22121 h\u22122\n75 ,\nand the latter to be systems with \u221223 > Ms \u2212 5 log h75 >\n44\n\u221225 or 1042 < LX /(erg s\u22121 h\u22122\n75 ) < 5 * 10 . Beyond this\nrange the X-ray and optical LFs are not well determined\nfrom our data\n6.1. Scaling relations for rich systems\nIn the regime of rich systems, as defined above, the Xray-to-optical scaling is LX \u221d Ls3.5 . In this regime, for a\n\u039bCDM cosmology, we found in \u00a74 that\n.\nm \u221d L1.5\u00b10.26\ns\n\n(13)\n\n0.43\u00b10.08\nThis then implies that m \u221d LX\n. This is in good\nagreement with the analysis of Ledlow et al. (1999), who\ncompared the observed XLF to PS mass functions and\nfound m \u221d L0.4\u00b10.03\n, in the bolometric X-ray band over\nX\n41\n45\nthe range 10 < LX /(erg s\u22121 h\u22122\n75 ) < 5 * 10 ) (solution\n\u039bCDM2 in their Table 1 which is similar to the \u039bCDM\nmodel adopted here.)\nIt is possible to compare this scaling with other cluster\nparameters such as velocity dispersion \u03c3 and temperature\nT . Under conditions of spherically-symmetric and isothermal equilibrium, the X-ray luminosity is connected to the\nvelocity dispersion of the virialized halos by the relation\nLX \u221d f 2 \u03c3 3 T 1/2 (Quintana & Melnick 1982), where f is the\nratio of the gas mass to the total cluster mass. If the gas\nand galaxies are in hydrostatic equilibrium, the average\nplasma temperature is proportional to the depth of the\ncluster potential well (T \u221d \u03c3 2 ), leading to the following\nsimple scaling relation LX \u221d f 2 \u03c3 4 . The observed LX \u2212 \u03c3\nrelation for clusters is not very far from this theoretical\nprediction. Several authors reported an empirical LX \u2212 \u03c3\nrelation close to LX \u221d \u03c3 4 (Quintana & Melnick 1982;\nMulchaey and Zabludoff 1998), while Xue & Wu (2000)\nand White, Jones & Forman (1997) derived somewhat\nsteeper relations, LX \u221d \u03c3 5.3\u00b10.21 and LX \u221d \u03c3 6.38\u00b10.46 ,\nrespectively.\nOur results allow an alternative determination of this\nscaling relationship. Since our systems are defined by\na fixedR overdensity criterion, their typical size scales as\n\u221e\nRs \u221d [ Lmin L\u03a6(L)dL]\u22121/3 . Using eq. 5 of paper V and\nthe cosmology dependent relation m = L\u03b1 we obtain,\n6\n\nLs \u221d \u03c3 3\u03b1\u22121 .\n\n(14)\n\nUsing the observed scaling relationship for the X-ray\u2013to\u2013\noptical luminosity ratio (LX \u221d L\u03b2s ) we can write\n6\u03b2\n\nLX \u221d \u03c3 3\u03b1\u22121\n\n(15)\n\nFor rich systems in the \u039bCDM cosmology, this yields\nLs \u221d \u03c3 1.7\u00b10.38 which is in good agreement with the results of Schaeffer et al. (1993), who found LV \u221d \u03c3 1.87\u00b10.44\nand those of Adami et al. 1998 who reported LBJ \u221d \u03c3 1.56\nwith a large scatter.\nIn the X-ray band, our result would translate into the\nfollowing scaling relation, LX = \u03c3 6\u00b11.3 , consistent with\nthose found by Xue & Wu (2000) and White, Jones, & Forman (1997). In \u03c4 CDM cosmology we would have obtained\n\nthe following relations Ls \u221d \u03c3 3\u00b10.13 and LX = \u03c3 10.5\u00b11.3 ,\nin disagreement with the observations.\nWe can go a step further if we assume that clusters follow an isothermal relation \u03c3 \u221d T 1/2 (which appears to\nbe supported by the data of Ponman et al. 1996; White,\nJones, & Forman 1997; Xue & Wu 2000). Inserting this\n\u03c3 \u2212 T model into the LX \u2212 \u03c3 scaling relationship we obtain LX \u221d T 3\u00b10.65 . Again this result is in agreement with\nthe fit of White, Jones, & Forman (1997) and Xue & Wu\n(2000).\nThus, in the regime of rich systems, the derived scalings are in agreement with the observations for the \u039bCDM\ncosmology. For the \u03c4 CDM cosmology the agreement is\npoorer.\n6.2. Scaling relations for poor systems\nFor poor systems, i.e. super-L\u2217gal galaxies and poor\ngroups, we found LX \u221d Ls1.5 . In this regime the mass\u2013to\u2013\nlight ratio is nearly constant, m \u221d Ls1\u00b10.1 , for both \u039bCDM\nand \u03c4 CDM cosmologies. This yields LX \u221d L2.2\u00b10.3\n, which,\ns\nbesides being in agreement with what we found, confirms\nin an independent way the bivariate scaling behavior of the\noptical\u2013to\u2013X-ray luminosity ratio over the group and cluster scales. Extending this analysis to velocity dispersions\nusing 14, we derive a steep relationship Ls \u221d \u03c3 3\u00b10.45 . Now\ncoupling our results with the observationally determined\nLX \u2212 Ls scaling relationship we obtain LX \u221d \u03c3 3.9\u00b11.2 .\nBecause of the problems mentioned in \u00a71, direct observational results for groups and poor clusters are much scattered, although they tend to lead to a flatter LX \u2212 \u03c3 relation compared to that of clusters. Mulchaey & Zabludoff\n(1998) obtain LX \u221d \u03c3 4.3\u00b10.4 , Ponman et al. (1996) obtain LX \u221d \u03c3 4.9\u00b12.1 , Helsdon & Ponman (2000) give LX \u221d\n\u03c3 4.5\u00b11.1 , whilst Mahdavi et al. (1997) and Mahdavi et al.\n(2000) found much flatter relations, i.e. LX \u221d \u03c3 1.56\u00b10.25\nand LX \u221d \u03c3 0.4\u00b10.3 . The fit of Xue & Wu (2000) is intermediate in slope with LX \u221d \u03c3 2.35\u00b10.21 . Our derived relation\nis consistent with the steep slopes and is marginally consistent with that of Xue & Wu.\nNow if we assume \u03c3 \u221d T (Helsdon & Ponman 2000),\nwe obtain the steeper relation LX \u221d T 3.9\u00b11.2 which is in\nagreement with the theoretical predictions of Cavaliere,\nMenci & Tozzi (1997, 1999) (see the discussion at the end\nof the section) and in excellent agreement with the results\nLX \u221d T 4.9\u00b10.9 of Helsdon & Ponman (2000).\nIf we had assumed a condition of virial equilibrium\nbetween condensed and diffuse baryons on the scale of\ngroups, we would have obtained a flatter relation LX \u221d\nT 2.5 similar to the trend observed in clusters. Since this\ndoes not provide a good fit to data (see Fig. 9), we reinforce the conclusion of Ponman et al. that at the low end\nhierarchy of the clustering pattern, i.e. for low X-ray temperature systems, the virial equilibrium condition between\ngalaxies and gas does not apply.\n6.3. Discussion\nThe break in power-law scalings of mass, LX , \u03c3 and\nT between rich and poor systems, occurring at LX \u223c\n1042 ergs\u22121 h\u22121\n75 , has been noted by many authors. Here\nwe have found that a change in the shape of the LX \u2212 Ls\nrelation occurs at the same point.\n\n\f10\n\nFig. 9.- The relation between the bolometric luminosity and\nthe temperature in \u039bCDM cosmology. Data are from Arnaud &\nEvrard (1999) (filled squares), Allen & Fabian (1998) (triangles)\nand Ponman et al. (1996) (empty squares). The thick line refers to\nour predicted scaling behavior. The dashed line refers to the selfsimilar case and the solid line to predictions of the thermodynamic\nmodel of the z = 0 ICM (in a \u039bCDM scenario) developed by Tozzi\n& Norman (1999) (the entropy excess is K = 0.3 * 1034 ergcm2 g\u22125/3\nconstant with epoch and the cooling is included). The dotted line\nshows the relation LX \u2212 T at z=0 derived by Tozzi and Norman\n(1999) within the projected radius used in Ponman et al. (1996).\n\nAt a similar point there is a net change in the chemical\nproperties and the spatial distribution of the ICM on the\nscales of groups (Renzini 1997, 1999). One might think\nthat this is due solely to a change in the properties of the\nICM. However, if the \u039bCDM PS mass function is correct,\nthen it is interesting that this transition corresponds to the\nsame mass scale (Ms \u223c \u221223 + 5 log h75 ) which separates\nefficient galaxy formation, with \u03a5 low and approximately\nconstant, from inefficient galaxy formation at which \u03a5 begins to rise as L0.5\ns . This would suggest a connection between galaxy formation and the properties of the ICM.\nThere are two proposed models for this connection. The\nstar formation may have preheated the gas, or the lowentropy gas may have preferentially cooled into stars.\nThe broken power-law behavior is in quantitative agreement with predictions of the preheating scenario (Kaiser\n1991, Evrard & Henry 1991) in which the entropy of the\nhot, diffuse intracluster medium is raised at early time\n(prior to gravitational collapse) by non-gravitational heating such as feedback effects of star formation, SN winds,\nshocks etc. Cavaliere, Menci, & Tozzi (1997, 1999) proposed a semi-analytic model of shocked ICM gas to explain the the observed LX \u2212 T relation. The same relation is reproduced by a model of Balogh et al. (1999)\nusing the physics of an adiabatic isentropic collapse of\na preheated gas. Both models make detailed predictions for the LX \u2212 T relations which are approximated\nby the power laws LX \u221d T 5 in the luminosity range\n3\nLX < 0.25 * 1044(erg s\u22121 h\u22122\n75 ) (groups) and LX \u221d T in the\n\n44\nluminosity range 0.25 * 1044 \u2264 LX /(erg s\u22121 h\u22122\n75 ) \u2264 5 * 10\n(rich groups and clusters). Tozzi & Norman (2000) combine these two scenarios in a single model taking into account an initial entropy excess and the transition between\nthe adiabatic and shock regime in the growth of X-ray halos. Their LX \u2212 T model and our predicted scalings are\ncompared to data in Fig. 9.\nOn the other hand, the preferential cooling of lowentropy gas into stars in galaxies might also break the\nscaling (Thomas & Couchman 1992; Bryan 2000; Muanwong et al. 2001). For this process to explain the scaling,\none requires greater efficiency of star formation for lowmass halos, e.g. 10% at T \u223c 1 keV vs 4% at T \u223c 10 keV\n(Bryan 2000). As discussed in \u00a74, for the \u039bCDM models, we found that the maximum star formation efficiency\nwas as high as 25% for poor systems, about 2.5 times the\nglobal efficiency of 10%. For rich systems the star formation efficiency drops below the global average. Note\nthat for a different mass spectrum, e.g. \u03c4 CDM there is no\nmass dependence of the star formation efficiency for high\nmasses.\nIn summary, at least for the \u039bCDM spectrum, it is interesting that the break in X-ray scaling properties occurs\nat roughly the same mass as the change in star formation\nefficiency. This suggests that there is a physical link between galaxy formation and the X-ray properties of the\nhot gas. Of course increased galaxy formation will lead to\ngreater feedback as well as more efficient cooling of lowentropy gas, so it is difficult to distinguish between the\nscenarios discussed above.\n\n7. summary and conclusions\n\nWe have used the B-band luminosity function of virialized systems to investigate scaling relations over a wide\ndynamic range of mass, from single galaxies to clusters of\ngalaxies.\nWhen our LF is compared to the Press-Schechter mass\nfunctions predicted in CDM cosmogonies we find that all\nthese models fail, if a constant mass\u2013to\u2013light ratio is assumed. Specifically, in the \u03c4 CDM and \u039bCDM models,\nthe mass\u2013to\u2013light ratio must vary as L\u22120.5 to match the\nfaint-end of the luminosity function. On the other hand,\na constant mass\u2013to\u2013light ratio and a ratio varying as L0.5\nmatch the bright ends of the \u03c4 CDM and \u039bCDM models,\nrespectively. For the \u039bCDM model, the efficiency of star\nformation is maximized in the range of one to \u223c 5 L\u2217gal\nor 1012.5 to 1013.5 h\u22121\n75 m\u2299 , the regime of single galaxies\nand poor groups. In this range, the fraction of baryons is\nstars is \u223c 25%. The latter behavior of the mass\u2013to\u2013light\nratio is in qualitative agreement with the predictions of recent semi-analytical models of galaxy formation, in which\ngalaxy formation is inhibited by the reheating of cool gas\non small-mass scales and by the long cooling times of hot\ngas on large-mass scales. The variation of the mass\u2013to\u2013\nlight ratio with scale found by some authors through direct\nestimates of the masses of galaxy systems lends indirect\nsupport to the \u039bCDM cosmology. A further test of the\nvarying mass\u2013to\u2013light ratio model could be made via the\ncomparison of observed peculiar velocities with the predictions from nearly all-sky optical galaxy catalogs such\nas the NOG.\nSince our sample of galaxies is complete for objects\n\n\f11\nbrighter than L\u2217gal , we have also measured the halo occupation number. We find that, for \u039bCDM models, this\nquantity grows more slowly than the total mass of the system, as required in the \"halo\" model of explain clustering.\nComparing X-ray luminosities as a function of optical\nluminosities in virialized systems, we find a break in the\npower-law slope of the relation as we go from groups to\nclusters, independent of the cosmological model. Dynamical scaling relations in X-ray systems are known to have\nbreak at a similar mass scale. Furthermore, the break occurs at a similar mass scale to that at which the massto-light ratio changes in the \u039bCDM model. This suggests physical link between galaxy formation and the X-ray\nproperties. However, these data cannot say whether this\nis due to reheating of the hot halo gas by supernovae or\nefficient cooling of low-entropy gas.\nWe look forward to forthcoming large field redshift sur-\n\nveys planned with SDSS (Gunn & Knapp 1993), 2dF (Colless 1998), 2MASS (Huchra et al. 1998), which will (a)\nextend the range over which the system luminosity is determined (b) lower the luminosity threshold over which\ngroup members are selected and (c) reduce the errors in\ntheir distribution statistics. Moreover the DEEP2 redshift\nsurvey (Davis & Faber 1998) will probe the variation with\ncosmic time of the M/L \u2212 L, LX \u2212 L and L \u2212 \u03c3 relations,\nallowing a deeper understanding of galaxy formation.\nWe wish to thank C.
