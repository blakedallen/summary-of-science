Phenomenogically, the BRs of three-body baryonic B decays are roughly\none order of magnitude larger than those of corresponding two-body decays. The preference\ncould be understood by the threshold enhancements occurring in the near threshold of\nbaryon-pair invariant mass [5, 6]. Moreover, one can easily find that in both three-body and\ntwo-body decays, the BRs for single charmed baryonic processes are two orders of magnitude\nlarger than those for charmless decays. The differences could be attributed to the CabibboKobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) [7] matrix elements, where single charmed (charmless) processes\nare associated with Vcb (Vub ). A more detailed review could be referred to Ref. [8].\nHowever, when BELLE observes the two charmed baryons in the final state, the characters appearing in the single charmed and charmless decays subsequently are changed.\n+1.0\n\u2212 +\n\u22124\nAccording to BELLE's results, the BRs BR(B + \u2192 \u039b+\nc \u039bc K ) = (6.5\u22120.9 \u00b1 1.1 \u00b1 3.4) \u00d7 10\n\n+2.9\n\u2212 0\n\u22124\nand BR(B 0 \u2192 \u039b+\nare measured with statistical sigc \u039bc K ) = (7.9\u22122.3 \u00b1 1.2 \u00b1 4.1) \u00d7 10\n\nnificance of 16.4\u03c3 and 6.6\u03c3, and the products of BRs for two-body decays are BR(B + \u2192\n\n+1.0\n\u22125\n+\n\u2212\n0\n+ \u2212\nand BR(B 0 \u2192 \u039e\u0304\u2212\n\u039e\u03040c \u039b+\nc \u039bc ) \u00d7 BR(\u039e\u0304c \u2192\nc ) \u00d7 BR(\u039e\u0304c \u2192 \u039e\u0304 \u03c0 ) = (4.8\u22120.9 \u00b1 1.1 \u00b1 1.2) \u00d7 10\n\u22125\n\u039e\u0304+ \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 ) = (9.3+3.7\nwith 8.7\u03c3 and 3.8\u03c3 significance, respectively.

In this paper, we are going to investigate\n\nthe possible mechanism to solve the unexpected large BRs in doubly charmed baryonic B\ndecays.\nIt has been noticed that final state interactions (FSIs) may play an important role on the\n2\n\n\fBRs, CP asymmetries (CPAs) and polarizations of vector mesons in two-body charmless and\ncharmed mesonic B decays [14]. According to our previous discussions, the inconsistency in\ntwo charmed baryons production results from ordinary estimations and QCD calculations.\nThat is, it should exist a new mechanism to enhance the BRs for the decays B \u2192 \u039e\u0304c \u039b+\nc and\n\n\u2212\nB \u2192 \u039b+\nc \u039bc K. In Ref. [6], two different mechanisms have been introduced, in which the\n\ntwo-body and three-body decays are governed by the \u03c3, \u03c0 0 and \u03c0 \u00b1 meson exchanges and\n\ncharmonium-like resonance Xcc\u0304 , respectively. However, according to the results of BELLE\n[9], there is no evidence for the existence of charmonium-like resonance. In addition, since\nthe doubly charmed baryonic B decays are found in two-body and three-body decays simultaneously, we speculate that they are induced by the similar mechanisms. Hence, we\nconsider that there exist other mechanisms which dictate the production of doubly charmed\nbaryons. We speculate that FSIs play an essential role on the suffering puzzles.

Since D and Ds are the same in\nthe SU(3) flavor symmetry except the carrying isospins are different, we will assume that the\neffective strong interactions are the same for D and Ds except the effects from the isospin of\nsystem. Hence, we will use gDDBc Bc instead of gDDsBc Bc . Similarly, the same assumption is\nalso applied to charmed baryons. We note that for two-body decays, because the rest frame\nof charmed baryon-pair is just the rest frame of B meson, we have set the invariant mass\n\u221a\nof charmed baryon-pair, denoted by k 2 , to be mB the mass of B meson. Therefore, the\nvalues of effective couplings are taken at the mB scale. However, for three-body decays, the\n\u221a\nscale should be chosen at k 2 and is a variable. Although the momentum variable in the\nloop integration in principle has no limit, the main contribution will arise when the on-shell\ncondition for the intermediate states D and Ds is satisfied, i.e. we can regard the production\nof doubly charmed baryons as the process B \u2192 \u039e\u0304c \u039b+\n, as illustrated by Fig. 1(a). Hence,\nc [D\u0304D + ]\ns\n\nin terms of narrow width approximation, 1/[(s \u2212 M 2 )2 + M 2 \u03932M ] \u2248 \u03c0\u03b4(s \u2212 M 2 )/M\u0393M , the\nintegration of Eq. (1) could be simplified as\nZ\n1\n|~pD |\n1\nd4 q\n2\n\u2248 \u2212 ps 2\nIDs (pB ) =\n2\n2\n4\n2\n2\n(2\u03c0) q \u2212 mD (pB \u2212 q) \u2212 mDs\n8\u03c0 pB\n\n(2)\n\nwith p~Ds being the spatial momentum of Ds meson. Since gBDDs is associated with the\n4\n\n\fdecays B \u2192 D\u0304Ds+ , we can easily find its relationship to the BRs of B \u2192 D\u0304Ds+ by\nBR(B \u2192 D\u0304Ds+ ) = \u03c4B\n\n|~pDs |\n|gBDDs (m2B )|2 .\n8\u03c0m2B\n\n(3)\n\nBy combining Eqs. (1), (2) and (3), we find that the BRs for B \u2192 \u039e\u0304c \u039b+\nc decays are related\nto those for B \u2192 D\u0304Ds+ by\nBR(B \u2192\n\n\u039e\u0304c \u039b+\nc )\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(m\u039ec + m\u039bc )2\n|~p\u039bc ||~pDs |\n1\u2212\n|gDDBc Bc (m2B )|2 BR(B \u2192 D\u0304Ds+ ),\n=\n2\n2\n32\u03c0\nmB\n\n(4)\n\nwhere m\u039bc (\u039ec ) is the mass of \u039bc (\u039ec ) baryon and ~p\u039bc is the spatial momentum of \u039bc .\nFrom Eq. (4), we clearly see that BR(B \u2192 \u039e\u0304c \u039b+\nc ) can give a constraint on the parameter\n\ngDDBc Bc (m2B ). However, since the constraint is only suitable at the mB scale, it will not\n\u2212\nhelp us to understand three-body decays such as B \u2192 \u039b+\nc \u039bc K in which the involving\n\n\u2212\ninvariant mass of the \u039b+\nc \u039bc system is below the mB scale and the value varies between 2m\u039bc\n\nand mB \u2212 mK . Moreover, the effects of FSIs should be strongly related to the momenta\nof final state particles, so that the contributions of energetic light baryons are much less\nimportant than those of slow heavy baryons. In sum, for giving a suitable effective strong\ncoupling for gDDBc Bc (k 2 ) which could be applied to various values of invariant mass, we\nwill model the effective coupling in Lorentz covariant form. In the following, we show our\nway to determine the form of effective coupling. If we regard the scattering DD \u2192 Bc Bc\nas a t-channel process in which the intermediate particle is a doubly-charmed baryon, the\nscattering amplitude could be approximately described by\n1\ng\u0303 2 (k 2 )\ng\u0303 2 (k 2 )\n\u03b3\n6\np\n\u016b\n\u2248\n\u03b3\n6\np\nv\n\u016bBc vBc ,\n5\nD\nB\n5\nD\nB\nc\nc\nm2D\n6 pD \u2212 6 pBc \u2212 mBcc\nmBcc\n\nwhere the fields of D meson have been neglected, g\u0303(k 2 ) expresses the coupling D \u2212 Bc \u2212 Bcc ,\nmBcc denotes the mass of exchanged doubly-charmed baryon and the small contributions\nfrom pD \u2212 pBc are neglected. Comparing to charmless baryonic decays, we speculate that\nthe dominance of FSIs is due to the particles in the doubly charmed baryonic decays carrying\nlower spatial momenta. In order to display the momentum-dependent strong coupling, we\nfurther parametrize the coupling to be g\u0303 2 (k 2 ) = gc2 m4Bcc /(|pBc1 \u2212 pBc2 |4 + m\u03034 ) where pBc1(2)\ndenote the four momenta of charmed baryons, gc is a dimensionless coupling constant and m\u0303\nis the effective mass, which is used to remove the singularity when pBc1 = pBc2 . Accordingly,\nwe model the effective coupling for the inelastic scattering DD \u2192 Bc Bc to be\ngDDBc Bc (k 2 ) = gc2\n\nm3Bcc\n.\n|pBc1 \u2212 pBc2 |4 + m\u03034\n5\n\n(5)\n\n\fSince the mBcc could be estimated by the masses of constituent quarks, the undetermined\nparameters actually are gc and m\u0303.\nSimilar to the decays B \u2192 \u039e\u0304c \u039b+\n, we find that the production of two charmed\nc [D\u0304D + ]\ns\n\nbaryons in three-body B decays could be arisen from the the inelastic scattering such as\n\u2212\n+ \u2212\nB \u2192 \u039b+\nc \u039bc [D 0 D\u0304 0 ] K. According to the Fig. 2(b), the decay amplitude for B \u2192 \u039bc \u039bc K could\n\nbe written as\nM(B \u2192\n\n\u2212\n\u039b+\nc \u039bc K)\n\nd4 q gDDBc Bc (k 2 ) gBKDD (k 2 , cos \u03b8)\nv\u039b ,\n(2\u03c0)4 q 2 \u2212 m2D + i\u03b5 (pB \u2212 q)2 \u2212 m2D + i\u03b5 c\n= CI gDDBc Bc (k 2 ) gBKDD (k 2 , cos \u03b8)ID (k 2 )\u016b\u039bc v\u039bc ,\n\n= \u016b\u039bc\n\nZ\n\n(6)\n\n\u221a\nwhere CI denotes the factor from the isospin wave function of system, taking to be 1/ 2 here,\nand gBKDD (k 2 , cos \u03b8) represents the decay amplitude for B \u2192 D\u0304 0 D 0 K decays. As known\nthat the decay amplitude is Lorentz invariant, for convenience, we will set the working frame\n\u2212\nin the rest frame of charmed baryon-pair. Hence, k 2 stands for the invariant mass of \u039b+\nc \u039bc\n\nand is a variable. Angle \u03b8 is the polar angle of \u039b+\nc with respect to the momentum direction\nof K meson. Since B \u2192 D\u0304 0 D 0 K are color-allowed processes, it is a good approximation to\nassume that the processes are dominated by factorizable effects. Thus, by employing the\nfactorization assumption, the decay amplitude for B \u2192 D\u0304 0 D 0 K could be written as\nGF\n\u03bc\ngBKDD (k 2 , cos \u03b8) = \u221a Vcb Vcs\u2217 aeff\n1 hDK|c\u0304\u03b3 s|0ihD\u0304|b\u0304\u03b3\u03bc c|Bi\n2\n\n(7)\n\nwhere aeff\n1 is the effective Wilson coefficient and the transition matrix elements are defined\nas\n\u0015\n\u0014\nm2B \u2212 m2D\nm2B \u2212 m2D\n2\nq\nF\n(q\n)\n+\nq\u03bc F0 (q 2 ),\nhD\u0304(pD\u0304 )|b\u0304\u03b3\u03bc c|B(pB )i = (pB + pD\u0304 )\u03bc \u2212\n\u03bc\n1\nq2\nq2\n\u0015\n\u0014\nm2D \u2212 m2K\nQ\u03bc F1DK (Q2 )\nhD(pD )K(pK )|c\u0304\u03b3\u03bc s|0i = (pD \u2212 pK )\u03bc \u2212\nQ2\nm2 \u2212 m2\n(8)\n+ D 2 K Q\u03bc F0DK (Q2 )\nQ\nwith q = pB \u2212 pD\u0304 and Q = pD + pK . In order to obtain the information of gBKDD on k 2\n\nand \u03b8, we have to analyze the decays B \u2192 D\u0304 0 D 0 K themselves. Since the production of\ndoubly charmed mesons is similar to that of doubly charmed baryons, in the following, k 2\n\n\u2212\nand \u03b8 will be regarded as the invariant mass of D\u0304 0 D 0 and \u039b+\nc \u039bc systems and the relative\n\nangle between p~D0 ,\u039b+c and ~pK , respectively. For deriving the decay rates as a function of\ninvariant mass k 2 and angle \u03b8, the coordinates in the k 2 rest frame are chosen as follows:\n6\n\n\f\u221a\np\n2\npB(K) = (EB(K) , 0, 0, |~p|) with EB(K) = (m2B \u00b1 k 2 \u2212 m2K )/2 k 2 and |~p| = EK\n\u2212 m2K and\n\u221a\n\u221a\np\npX(X\u0304) = ( k 2 /2, \u00b1|~pX | sin \u03b8, 0, \u00b1|~pD | cos \u03b8) with |~pX | = k 2 /2 * 1 \u2212 (2mX )2 /k 2 in which\n\n2\nX could be D 0 meson or \u039b+\nc baryon. Based on these coordinates, it is obvious that q and\n\nQ2 are functions of k 2 and \u03b8. This is the reason why we set the coupling gBKDD as a function\nof k 2 and cos \u03b8. Hence, by including the phase space for three-body decay and using the\nchosen coordinates, the differential decay rate for B \u2192 D\u0304 0 D 0 K is expressed by\nr\nd\u0393(B \u2192 D\u0304 0 D 0 K)\n|~p\u2032K |\n(2mD )2\n2\n2\n=\n|g\n(k\n,\ncos\n\u03b8)|\n(9)\n1\n\u2212\nBKDD\n2\ndk 2 d cos \u03b8\n28 \u03c0 3 mB\nk2\np\n\u2032\n\u20322\n\u2212 m2K and EK\n= (m2B \u2212 k 2 + m2K )/2mB . In terms of Eq. (6), similarly,\nwith |~p\u2032K | = EK\n\u2212\nwe can also obtain the differential decay rate for B \u2192 \u039b+\nc \u039bc K decays as\n\n\u0012\n\u00133/2\n\u2212\nd\u0393(B \u2192 \u039b+\n|~p\u2032K |\n(2m\u039bc )2\nc \u039bc K)\n2 2\n= 7 3 2 |ID (k )| 1 \u2212\ndk 2 d cos \u03b8\n2 \u03c0 mB\nk2\n\u00d7|gBKDD (k 2 , cos \u03b8)|2 |CI gDDBc Bc (k 2 )|2 .\n\n(10)\n\nFrom Eqs. (7), (9) and (10), we immediately know that if we can determine gBKDD (k 2 , cos \u03b8)\nfrom B \u2192 D\u0304 0 D 0 K and gDDBc Bc (k 2 ) from B \u2192 \u039e\u0304c \u039b+\nc , then in principle we can make predic\u2212\ntions on the BRs of B \u2192 \u039b+\nc \u039bc K.\n\nIn order to understand whether we can predict the BRs for three-body doubly charmed\nbaryonic decays, we have to know how many unknown parameters can be controlled by theoretical calculations and parametrizations and constrained by experimental measurements.\nAt first, we discuss the unknowns of Eq. (5) for gDDBc Bc . As mentioned before, mBcc could\nbe estimated by the masses of constitute quarks. If we chose mc = 1.6 GeV and the light\nquark mq = 0.3 GeV, then we get mBcc = 3.5 GeV. The estimated value is close to the\nparticle \u039e+\ncc (3520), observed recently by SELEX at FNAL [15]. Therefore, there remain two\nuncertain parameters gc and m\u0303 for effective coupling gDDBc Bc . However, the observation\nof B + \u2192 \u039e\u03040c \u039b+\nc only can constrain their ratio. Thus, without further assumption, one unknown will be left. Nevertheless, we still can set the value of m\u0303 by a proper approach. As\nstated early, the usage of m\u0303 is to avoid the suffering problem when the spatial momentum\nof charmed baryon in the k 2 rest frame is approaching vanishment. For two-body decays,\nwe can easily know that the spatial momentum of \u039b+\np\u039b+c | = 1.15 GeV. Therefore, the\nc is |~\nresults are insensitive to m\u0303 if its value is less than 1.5 GeV. However, for three-body decays,\nthe available range of spatial momentum of \u039b+\np\u039b+c | = [0, 0.71] GeV. Needless to say, the\nc is |~\n7\n\n\f\u2212\nvalue choice of m\u0303 will influence on the BRs of B \u2192 \u039b+\nc \u039bc K significantly. To get a balance\n\nin both kinds of decays, the m\u0303 can be chosen so that its value will not affect the two-body\ndecays and still can protect three-body from overestimation. Since |pBc1 \u2212 pBc1 | \u2248 2|p~\u039bc | in\nboth two-body and three-body decays, we find the better value for m\u0303 is around 1.0 GeV\nwhich is similar to the magnitude of momentum in two-body decays. Hence, if we accept\nthis value as input, B + \u2192 \u039e\u03040c \u039b+\nc can directly give a bound on gc .\nNext, we concentrate on the effective coupling of Eq. (7). From the equation, we see that\nDK\nthe main unknowns are from the form factors F1(0) and F1(0)\n. We can use a proper QCD\n\napproach, such as perturbative QCD [16], relativistic quark model [17] and light-front quark\nmodel [18] etc, to calculate the transition form factors F1(0) . According to the results of\nlight-front quark model, the explicit expressions can be given by [18]\nF1 (q 2 ) =\n\n(1 \u2212\n\nAs for the form factors\n\n0.67\n0.67\n, F0 (q 2 ) =\n.\n(11)\n2\n2 2\n2\n2\n1.25q /mB + 0.39(q /mB ) )\n(1 \u2212 0.65q 2 /m2B )\nDK\nF1(0)\n, since there exists no good method to estimate the time-like\n\nform factors, what we can do is as usual to parametrize them to be\nF1DK (Q2 ) =\n\nF DK (0)\n,\n1 + aDK Q2 /m2X\n\nF0DK (Q2 ) =\n\nF DK (0)\n,\n1 + Q2 /m2X\n\n(12)\n\nwhere we set mX = mB \u2212 mD as the maximum invariant mass of DK system. We note that\nthe parametrizations in Eq. (12) do not display the behavior predicated by PQCD at the\nlarge Q2 , i.e. F DK \u2192 1/(Q2 ln(Q2 /\u039b2 )) [20]; nevertheless it could be a good approximation\n\nsince the dominant contributions for B \u2192 D\u0304 0 D 0 K are close to the threshold region of\nthe invariant mass in the DK system. In terms of the parametrizations, we see that two\nparameters are needed to be determined. However, so far only the BRs of B \u2192 D\u0304 0 D 0 K are\n\nmeasured. Hence, we only can determine the allowed ratio of aDK and F DK (0) by the data\nof B \u2192 D\u0304 0 D 0 K. If experiments can provide the information on angular distribution, we\ncan further fix the remaining unknown. Nevertheless, we can still obtain some information\non F DK (0) by considering the two-body decay B 0 \u2192 Ds\u2212 K + . It is known that the decay\nis governed by annihilation topology [21] and the BR is measured to be (3.8 \u00b1 1.3) \u00d7 10\u22125\n\n[12]. In terms of factorization assumption, the decay amplitude for B 0 \u2192 Ds\u2212 K + can be\nexpressed by\nGF\n\u2217 eff\na2 fB hDs\u2212 K + |s\u0304 6 pB c|0i\nM(B 0 \u2192 Ds\u2212 K + ) = \u221a Vcb Vud\n2\nGF\n\u2217 eff\n= \u221a Vcb Vud\na2 fB (m2Ds \u2212 m2K )F0Ds K (m2B )\n2\n8\n\n\fwhere fB is the decay constant of B meson, aeff\n2 is the color suppressed effective Wilson\ncoefficient and nonfactorizable effects have been included, and the time-like form factors\ndefined in Eq. (8) are used. If we neglect the differences between Ds and D mesons, we\ncan get the value of form factor F0DK at mB scale. By taking Vcb = 0.041, fB = 0.2\nGeV, mDs (K) = 1.969(0.493) GeV, GF = 1.166 \u00d7 10\u22125 GeV\u22122 , \u03c4B0 = 1.55 \u00d7 10\u221212 s [12],\n\n0\n\u2212 +\n\u22125\nDK\naeff\n(m2B ) \u2248 F0Ds K (m2B ) = 1.0.\n2 = 0.275 [22], and BR(B \u2192 Ds K ) = 3.5\u00d710 , we get F0\n\nRelating the extracted value to the F0DK (Q2 ) parametrized in Eq. (12), we immediately\n\nobtain F DK (0) = 3.41. If we adopt this value as input, the BRs of B \u2192 D\u0304 0 D 0 K can fix the\n\nparameter aDK . Consequently, by including proper measurements, we can determine the\nintroduced parameters with errors from experiments.\nIn order to calculate the numerical values, besides the values taken before, we set other\ninputs as follows: m\u039e0 = 2.471 GeV, m\u039bc = 2.285 GeV, mD0 = 1.865 GeV, \u03c4B+ = 1.67 \u00d7\n10\u221212 s, BR(B + \u2192 D\u0304 0 Ds+ ) = (1.3 \u00b1 0.4)%, BR(B + \u2192 D\u0304 0 D 0 K) = (1.9 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10\u22123\n\n[12] and aeff\n1 = 0.986 [22]. Although in general it is not necessary to regard mBcc = 3.5\n\nGeV, m\u0303 = 1.0 GeV and F DK (0) = 3.41 as the inputs, however, it will be interesting\n\u2212\nto see whether by using these values, the predicted BRs of B \u2192 \u039b+\nc \u039bc K are consistent\n\nwith the observations. In addition, we find that actually the BRs of B \u2192 D\u0304 0 D 0 K are\n\ninsensitive to the value of aDK . That is, in our parametrizations, it is a good approximation\n\nto take aDK = 1.0. Accordingly, we have BR(B + \u2192 D\u0304 0 D 0 K + ) = 2.1 \u00d7 10\u22123 and the\ndifferential BR as a function of invariant mass M(D 0 D\u0304 0 ) for B + \u2192 D\u0304 0 D 0 K + is presented in\n\u2212 +\nFig. 3(a). To demonstrate the correlation between gc and BR(B + \u2192 \u039b+\nc \u039bc K ), we further\n\n\u22123\nand BR(B + \u2192\nset gc = (3.1, 3.3 , 3.5) so that the BR(B + \u2192 \u039e\u03040c \u039b+\nc ) = (3.4, 4.4, 5.6) \u00d7 10\n\n\u2212 +\n\u22124\n\u039b+\nc \u039bc K ) = (6.6, 8.5, 10.9) \u00d7 10 ; then, we display the corresponding differential BR\n\u2212 +\n\u2212\nfor B + \u2192 \u039b+\nas a function of invariant mass M(\u039b+\nc \u039bc K\nc \u039bc ) with dash-dotted, solid\n\nand dashed lines, respectively, in Fig. 3(b). From these results, we see clearly that the\n+ \u2212\nobservations of B \u2192 \u039e\u0304c \u039b+\nc and B \u2192 \u039bc \u039bc K could be understood by the similar FSIs.\n\nFurthermore, to illustrate the influence of the introduced parameters F DK (0), aDK , m\u0303 and\ngc , we free these parameters and let the data decide the allowed ranges. The results are\n\nshown in Fig. 4. By Fig. 4(a), we confirm that the BRs of doubly charmed mesonic decays\nare not sensitive to aDK . Taking 1\u03c3 error on BR(B + \u2192 D\u0304 0 D 0 K + ), the range for the value of\n\nF DK (0) is (3, 3.9). With the bound (2.4, 5.3) \u00d7 10\u22123 on BR(B + \u2192 \u039e\u03040c \u039b+\nc ) [10], from Fig. 4,\n\nwe find that BR(B + \u2192 \u039e\u03040c \u039b+\nc ) is sensitive to gc but insensitive to m\u0303 and we also see that\n9\n\n\fK )10\n\n3\n\n)10\n\n3\n\n4\n\n+\n\nc\n\n+\n+\n\n10\n\n2\n\n2\n\ndB/dk (B\n\n+\n\n2\n\ndB/dk (B\n\n15\n\nc\n\n0\n\nD D\n\n0\n\n3\n\n1\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n3.6\n\n3.8\n\n4.0\n\n4.2\n\n4.4\n\n4.6\n0\n\n4.55\n\n4.8\n\n4.60\n\n4.65\n\nM(D D )(GeV)\n\n(a)\n\n4.70\n\n0\n\n(b)\n\n4.75\n\nM(\n\n4.80\n\n+\nc\n\nc\n\n)(GeV)\n\n\u2212 + as a function\nFIG. 3: The differential BRs for (a) B + \u2192 D\u0304 0 D 0 K + and (b) B + \u2192 \u039b+\nc \u039bc K\n\u2212\nDK (0) = 3.41,\nof invariant mass M (D 0 D\u0304 0 ) and M (\u039b+\nc \u039bc ), respectively, where we have set F\n\naDK = 1.0, mBcc = 3.5 GeV and m\u0303 = 1.0 GeV.

We note that\n\nthe values of BR (in units of 10\u22124) shown in the figure (c) only contain 1\u03c3 statistical and\nsystemic errors. By the figure, we also find that the three-body doubly charmed baryonic\ndecays are much more sensitive to gc and m\u0303, in particular m\u0303. Clearly, based on our modeling\n10\n\n\fof Eq. (5), the parametrizations of Eq. (12) and the limited information on data, in general\n\u2212\nwe cannot make concrete predictions on the decays B \u2192 \u039b+\nc \u039bc K.\n\nAlthough at present we cannot give precise predictions on doubly charmed baryonic\ndecays, however, in terms of the proposed mechanisms we can have some implications on\n\u2213\n+\n+\nother unobserved processes such as B \u2192 \u039e\u03040c \u03a3c and B \u2192 \u039b\u00b1\nc \u03a3c K etc. Since \u03a3c and \u039bc\n\nhave the same quark contents except the former is isospin I = 1 while the latter is I = 0, by\np\nutilizing Eqs. (1) and (5) and introducing a corrected factor CI = 2/3 for isospin, we can\n\neasily obtain the BRs for B \u2192 \u039e\u03040c \u03a3c . With the values of gc and m\u0303 which are satisfied with\n\n+\n0 +\nthe measurement of B + \u2192 \u039e\u03040c \u039b+\nc , the estimated BR(B \u2192 \u039e\u0304c \u039bc ) is presented in Fig. 5(a)\n\nin which we have set m\u03a3c = 2.452 GeV and the values in the figure denote the available BR\nin units of 10\u22123 .

(10) with the values of the parameters satisfied with the observation of B + \u2192 \u039b+\nc \u039bc K\n\n\u2213 +\nwithin 1\u03c3 error, the estimated BR(B + \u2192 \u039b\u00b1\nc \u03a3c K ) is displayed in Fig. 5(b) where the\n\nvalues in the figure are the available BR in units of 10\u22124 . From the figure, we see that the\n\n\u2213 +\nBR of B + \u2192 \u039b\u00b1\ncould be as large as 10\u22124 . If we extend the FSIs to the processes\nc \u03a3c K\nassociated with the creation of the strange quark-antiquark pair, i.e. ss\u0304 pair instead of dd \u0304\n\npair of Fig. 1(a), and assume that the relevant strong couplings are the same, interestingly\n+\nwe obtain BR(B + \u2192 \u03a9\u0304c \u039e+\nc ) \u2248 5.5%. Although \u03a9\u0304c \u039ec has much less allowed phase space,\n\n11\n\n\fdue to the enhancement of Eq. (5), we see that the BR for B + \u2192 \u03a9\u0304c \u039e+\nc is not suppressed.\nHowever, since we have assumed that the effective couplings of FSIs for the production of\ndoubly charmed baryons are the same, one cannot take the result of B + \u2192 \u03a9\u0304c \u039e+\nc seriously.\nAfter all, the FSIs for real situations could be different in different processes. What we have\ndisplayed is that our FSIs could enhance the BR of process which the corresponding phase\nspace is suppressed.\nFinally, we make some remarks on other possible FSIs for three-body modes, such as\n\u2212\n+\n+ \u2212\n+\n+ \u2212 +\nB \u2192 \u039e\u0304c \u039bc \u2192 \u039b+\nc \u039bc K and B \u2192 D\u0304Ds \u2192 \u039bc \u039bc K. As known that the BR(B \u2192 \u039bc \u039bc K )\n\nis only few factors smaller than BR(B + \u2192 \u039e\u03040c \u039b+\nc ), if we regard that the FSIs are inelastic\n\nscattering, by the loop and phase space suppressions, we expect that the contributions\n\u2212\n+\n0 +\n+ \u2212 +\nthrough B \u2192 \u039e\u0304c \u039bc \u2192 \u039b+\nc \u039bc K should be small. As for the decay B \u2192 D\u0304 Ds \u2192 \u039bc \u039bc K\n\nshown in Fig. 6(a), if its contribution is significant, one can speculate that the same FSIs\ncould also arise from the doubly charmed mesonic decays such as B + \u2192 D\u0304 0 D 0 K + , shown\nin Fig. 6(b). From Fig. 6(a) and (b), we conjecture that the former should be smaller than\nthe latter due to one more quark pair being produced. Since we have assumed that the\ndominant effects for B + \u2192 D\u0304 0 D 0 K + are factorizable contributions, described by Eq. (7),\n\n\u2212 +\nif the decay chain B + \u2192 D\u0304 0 Ds+ \u2192 \u039b+\nis not negligible, in our analysis it could be\nc \u039bc K\n\nregarded as a subleading effect.\nxxxx\nxxxx s\nxxxx\nxxxx\nxxxx\nxxxx\nxxxx u\nxxxx\nxxxxx xxxx\nxxxxx s xxxx\nxxxxx xxxx\nxxxxx xxxx\nxxxxx xxxx\nxxxxx xxxx\nxxxxxc xxxx\nxxxxx xxxx\n\n\u0392\n\nxxxxxx\nbxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\n\nxxxxxx\n+ xxxxxx\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\nuxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\n\nxxxxx xxxx\nxxxxxc xxxx\nxxxxx xxxx\nxxxxx xxxx\nxxxxx xxxx\nxxxxx xxxx\nxxxxx xxxx\nxxxxxu xxxx\n\nxxxxu\nxxxx\nxxxx\nxxxxc\nxxxx\nxxxx\nxxxxd\nxxxx\nxxxxd\nxxxx\nxxxxc\nxxxx\nxxxx\nxxxx\nxxxxu\n\n+\n\n\u039a\n\nxxxxx xxxxx\nxxxxx s xxxxx\nxxxxx xxxxx\nxxxxx xxxxx\nxxxxx xxxxx\nxxxxx xxxxx\nxxxxx c xxxxx\nxxxxx\n\n\u2212\n\n\u039bc\n\n\u039b+c\n\n(a)\n\nxxxxxx\nbxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\n+ xxxxxx\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\nuxxxxxx\nxxxxxx\n\n\u0392\n\nxxxxx xxxx\nxxxxx xxxx\nxxxxx c xxxx\nxxxxx xxxx\nxxxxx xxxx\nxxxxx xxxx\nxxxxx u xxxx\nxxxxx xxxx\n\nxxxx\nxxxxc\nxxxx\nxxxx\nxxxx\nxxxx\nxxxx\nxxxxu\n\nD0\n\nxxx\nxxx\nxxx\nxxx\nxxx\nxxx\nxxx\n\nD0\n\nu\nc\n\nxxxx\nxxxxs\nxxxx\nxxxx\nxxxx\nxxxxu\nxxxx\n\n+\n\n\u039a\n\n(b)\n\n\u2212 + decay and (b) for B + \u2192 D\u0304 0 D + \u2192\nFIG. 6: Flavor diagrams (a) for B + \u2192 D\u0304 0 Ds+ \u2192 \u039b+\ns\nc \u039bc K\n\nD\u0304 0 D 0 K + decay.\n\nIn summary, we have studied two-body and three-body doubly charmed baryonic B\ndecays. We find that the observed processes could be produced by FSIs B + \u2192 \u039e\u0304c \u039b+\nc [D\u0304D + ]\ns\n\n\u2212\nand B \u2192 \u039b+\nc \u039bc [D\u0304 0 D 0 ] K. In terms of proper modeling for the effective strong coupling and\n\nfactorization assumption, we find that with the constrained values of the parameters, the\nestimated results could be compatible with the current data. In addition, we also show the\n12\n\n\f+\n\u00b1 \u2213 +\nimplications of FSIs on B + \u2192 \u039e\u03040c \u03a3+\nc and B \u2192 \u039bc \u03a3c K and get that their BRs could be\n\n\u22124\nas large as BR(B + \u2192 \u039e\u03040c \u039b+\nc ) and 10 , respectively. In addition, extending the FSIs to\n\nthe processes associated with the creation of ss\u0304 pair, BR(B + \u2192 \u03a9\u0304c \u039e+\nc ) at percent level is\nachievable.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe author would like to thank Prof. Chao-Qiang Geng and Dr. Shang-Yuu Tsai for\nuseful discussions.
