Up to now, all known examples of noncompact homogeneous Einstein manifolds are solvmanifolds. The study of Einstein solvmanifolds is currently very active. In\nparticular, Heber ([11]) deeply studied Einstein solvmanifolds and obtained many essential results. One of his theorems states that the moduli space of Einstein solvmanifolds\nmay have large dimension. Despite of that, we do not know many explicit examples of\nEinstein solvamnifolds; in particular, Einstein solvmanifolds whose nilradicals have the\nnilpotency greater than two. The purpose of this paper is to introduce and study a class of\nsolvmanifolds, and provide new examples of Einstein spaces. Our class contains Einstein\nsolvmanifolds whose nilradicals are of two, three and four-step. We need to know explicit\nexamples for the further study of Einstein solvmanifolds.\nHere we briefly recall some known examples of noncompact homogeneous Einstein\nmanifolds. One strategy for finding Einstein solvmanifolds is to consider solvmanifolds\n0\n\nMathematics Subject Classification (2000): 53C30, 22E25, 53C25, 53C35,\n\n1\n\n\fwith good geometric structures. Typical examples are symmetric spaces of noncompact\ntype. Other examples are noncompact homogeneous K\u00e4hler-Einstein manifolds, which are\nmodeled by solvable normal j-algebras (see [20]), and quaternionic K\u00e4hler solvmanifolds\n(see [2], [7]). The other strategy is to consider solvable extensions of good nilmanifolds.\nTypical examples are Damek-Ricci spaces, which are the one-dimensional solvable extensions of generalized Heisenberg groups ([5], [8], see also [3]). Other examples are given by\nMori ([18]); he started from complex graded Lie algebras of second kind and considered\nthe solvable extensions of the associated nilmanifolds. In fact, our construction is a generalization of his study. Other strategy for finding Einstein solvmanifolds can be found in\nrecent articles, for example, see [15], [16] and [10]. The list of known examples of Einstein\nsolvmanifolds can be found in [17].\nIn this paper we employ the second strategy. We take the nilradicals of parabolic\nsubalgebras of semisimple Lie algebras. These nilpotent Lie algebras admit the natural\ninner products, and can be investigated in term of graded Lie algebras. In Section 2,\nwe mention some properties of graded Lie algebras and define our nilmanifolds. The\nstructures and curvatures of our nilmanifolds will be studied in Sections 3 and 4. In\nSection 5, we study curvature property of one-dimensional solvable extensions of our\nnilmanifolds. We find that there is a natural solvable extension, that is, only one candidate\nto be Einstein. Curvatures of the natural solvable extension is studied in Section 6. We\nsee in Section 7 that our solvmanifold is Einstein if the nilradical is of two-step. This\nprovides many new examples of Einstein solvmanifolds and some of them have \"unusual\"\neigenvalue types. Other new examples of Einstein solvmanifolds with three-step and fourstep nilradicals will be given in Section 8. We observe in Section 9 that, if g is small, then\nevery attached solvmanifolds are Einstein.\nNote that, if a parabolic subalgebra is minimal, then its nilradical coincides with the\nnilpotent part of the Iwasawa decomposition. In this case the constructed solvmanifold\ncoincides with the rank one reduction of a symmetric space of noncompact type. Therefore our class of solvmanifolds essentially contains noncompact symmetric spaces. The\nstructures of the rank one reductions of noncompact symmetric spaces will be mentioned\nin Section 10.\nThe author would like to thank Professor Soji Kaneyuki, Professor Hiroshi Asano and\nthe referee.

Put n := [s, s] and a := n\u22a5 .\nDefinition 1.1 A solvmanifold (s, h, i) is called standard if a is abelian. A standard\nsolvmanifold (s, h, i) is said to be of Iwasawa-type if (i) adA is symmetric for every A \u2208 a,\nand (ii) there exists A0 \u2208 a such that every eigenvalue of adA0 on n is a positive real\nnumber.\nTo calculate the Ricci curvatures of our solvmanifolds, we need the following particular\nvectors.\nDefinition 1.2 For a solvmanifold (s, h, i), we call H0 \u2208 a the mean curvature vector if\nhH0 , Ai = tr(adA ) for every A \u2208 a.\nNote that H0 is the mean curvature vector for the embedding of N into S, where N\ndenotes the Lie subgroup of S with Lie algebra n.\nProposition 1.3 ([24]) Let (s, h, i) be a solvmanifold of Iwasawa type and H0 be the\nmean curvature vector. Denote by Ric and Ricn the Ricci curvatures of s and n, respectively. Then,\n(1) Ric(A, A\u2032 ) = \u2212tr(adA ) \u25e6 (adA\u2032 ) for A, A\u2032 \u2208 a,\n(2) Ric(A, X) = 0,\n(3) Ric(X) = Ricn(X) \u2212 (tr(adH0 )/|H0 |2 ) * adH0 X for X \u2208 n.\nProposition 1.3 leads that, if (s, h, i) is Einstein then so is (RH0 + n, h, i). For a\nsolvmanifold (s, h, i), we call dim a the algebraic rank and (RH0 + n, h, i) the rank one\nreduction. Note that H0 is also the mean curvature vector of the solvmanifold (RH0 +\nn, h, i).\nProposition 1.4 ([1]) The Ricci curvature of a nilmanifold (n, h, i) is given by\nX\nX\nRicn = (1/4)\nadEi \u25e6 (adEi )\u2217 \u2212 (1/2)\n(adEi )\u2217 \u25e6 adEi ,\n\nwhere {Ei } is an orthonormal basis of n and (adEi )\u2217 denotes the dual of the adjoint\noperator defined by h(adEi )\u2217 X, Y i = hX, adEi Y i.\n3\n\n\fPropositions 1.3 and 1.4 state that the Ricci curvatures of solvmanifolds of Iwasawatype can be calculated in terms of the mean curvature vectors, adjoint operators and their\ndual operators.\nProposition 1.5 ([11]) For a standard Einstein solvmanifold, there exists \u03bb > 0 such\nthat the real part of every eigenvalue of ad\u03bbH0 is a positive integer.\nLet \u03bc1 < \u03bc2 < * * * < \u03bcm be the real parts of eigenvalues of ad\u03bbH0 without common divisor, and d1 , d2 , . . . , dm the corresponding multiplicities. We call (\u03bc1 < * * * <\n\u03bcm ; d1 , . . . , dm ) the eigenvalue type of an Einstein solvmanifold. For example, the eigenvalue types of Damek-Ricci spaces are (1 < 2; d1, d2 ).\n\n2\n\nNilmanifolds attached to graded Lie algebras\n\nIn this section we briefly recall some properties of graded Lie algebras and define the\nnilmanifolds associated to them. We refer to [13], [22] for graded Lie algebras.\nLet g be a semisimple Lie algebra. A decomposition of g into subspaces,\ng=\n\nX\n\ngk\n\nk\u2208Z\n\nis called a gradation if [gk , gl ] \u2282 gk+l holds for every k and l. A Lie algebra with gradation\nP\nis called a graded Lie algebra. By definition, n := k>0 gk is a nilpotent subalgebra.\nIn the theory of graded Lie algebras, it is fundamental that there exist the characteristic element Z \u2208 g and a grade-reversing Cartan involution \u03c3. An element Z is called\nthe characteristic element if gk = {X \u2208 g | [Z, X] = k * X} for every k. A Cartan\ninvolution \u03c3 is said to be grade-reversing if \u03c3(gk ) = g\u2212k for every k. Note that the\ncharacteristic element is unique. It is easy to show that \u03c3 is grade-reversing if and only\nif \u03c3(Z) = \u2212Z. A Cartan involution \u03c3 defines the natural inner product B\u03c3 on g by\nB\u03c3 (X, Y ) := \u2212B(X, \u03c3(Y )), where B denotes the Killing form of g. Now we can define\nour nilmanifolds:\nP\nDefinition 2.1 Let g =\ngk be a graded Lie algebra. The nilpotent Lie algebra n :=\nP\nk>0 gk endowed with the inner product B\u03c3 is called the nilmanifold attached to the\ngraded Lie algebra, or shortly, nilmanifold attached to GLA.\nP\nNote that k\u22650 gk is a parabolic subalgebra of g and n is the nilradical of it. Conversely, it is known that every parabolic subalgebra of g can be obtained in this way.\nTherefore, we are considering the nilradicals of all parabolic subalgebras of all semisimple\nLie algebras.\n\n4\n\n\fP\nWe also note that our nilpotent Lie algebras n are related to R-spaces. Let g =\ngk\nbe a graded Lie algebra, G the centerless Lie group with Lie algebra g, and P the subgroup\nP\nof G with Lie algebra k\u22640 gk . The quotient space G/P is an R-space (it is sometimes\ncalled a real flag manifold). By definition, n can be naturally identified with the tangent\nspaces of G/P . Therefore, there is a correspondence between the class of our nilmanifolds\nand the class of R-spaces (but this is not one-to-one).\nP\nA graded Lie algebra g =\ngk is said to be of \u03bd-th kind if g\u03bd 6= 0 and gk = 0 for\nevery k > \u03bd. The existence of a grade-reversing Cartan involution implies that dim gk =\ndim g\u2212k , therefore, a \u03bd-th kind gradation satisfies gk = 0 for every |k| > \u03bd. Note that, for\nP\na graded Lie algebra of \u03bd-th kind, the nilpotent Lie algebra n = k>0 gk is not of \u03bd-step\nin general, but at most \u03bd-step nilpotent. We will explain this later.\nTo state the classification of gradations, we now start from a semisimple symmetric\npair of noncompact type (g, k) with Cartan involution \u03c3. Take the Cartan decomposition\ng = k + p with respect to \u03c3 and a maximal abelian subspace a in p. Let \u2206 be the root\nsystem of g with respect to a. Recall that we say \u03b1 \u2208 a\u2217 \u2212 {0} is a root if\n0 6= g\u03b1 := {X \u2208 g | [H, X] = \u03b1(H) * X for every H \u2208 a}.\nNote that g can be decomposed into the direct sum of root spaces: g = g0 +\nLet \u03a0 := {\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1r } be a set of simple roots of \u2206 and define\n\nP\n\n\u03b1\u2208\u2206\n\ng\u03b1 .\n\nC := {H \u2208 a | \u03b1i (H) \u2208 Z\u22650 for every \u03b1i \u2208 \u03a0}\n= {c1 H 1 + * * * + cr H r | c1 , . . . , cr \u2208 Z\u22650 },\nwhere {H 1 , . . . , H r } is the dual basis of \u03a0, that is, \u03b1i (H j ) = \u03b4ij . Then, every element\nZ \u2208 C gives a gradation, by putting\nX\ngk :=\ng\u03b1 .\n\u03b1(Z)=k\n\nOn the other hand, every gradation of g can be obtained in this way up to conjugation\n(see [14], [22]). We summarize this as follows.\nTheorem 2.2 ([14], [22]) There is a bijective correspondence between the set of the isomorphism classes of gradations on g and the set of Aut(DD)-orbits of C, where Aut(DD)\ndenotes the automorphism group of the Dynkin diagram of \u2206.\nIt is easy to see that the gradation given by Z \u2208 C is of \u03bd-th kind if and only if\nP\n\u03bd =\u03b1\ne(Z), where \u03b1\ne denotes the highest root. Obviously n = k>0 gk is at most \u03bd-step\nnilpotent. We will mention here the condition for n to be \u03bd-step nilpotent.\nP\nP\nA graded Lie algebra g =\ngk is said to be of type \u03b10 if g1 generates k>0 gk . This\nnotation was introduced by Kaneyuki and Asano ([14]), and they showed that a graded Lie\nP\nalgebra g = gk is of type \u03b10 if and only if Z \u2208 {c1 H 1 + * * * + cr H r | c1 , . . . , cr \u2208 {0, 1}}\nup to conjugation. This property is related to the structure of the attached nilmanifold.\n5\n\n\fProposition 2.3 Let (n, B\u03c3 ) be the nilmanifold attached to a graded Lie algebra g =\nof \u03bd-th kind. Then,\n(1) there exists a type \u03b10 gradation g =\n\nP\n\ng\u2032k which satisfies n =\n\nP\n\nk>0\n\nP\n\ngk\n\ng\u2032k ,\n\n(2) n is of \u03bd-step nilpotent if and only if the gradation is of type \u03b10 .\nP\nProof. (1): Denote the characteristic element of the gradation g =\ngk by Z = ci1 H i1 +\n* * * + cis H is with ci1 , . . . , cis > 0. Then the gradation given by Z \u2032 = H i1 + * * * + H is\nP\nsatisfies the condition. (2): Assume g =\ngk is of type \u03b10 . Since g1 generates g\u03bd ,\n\u03bd\nthe lower central series satisfies C (n) 6= 0. Thus n is of \u03bd-step nilpotent. To show the\nP\nconverse, assume g = gk is not of type \u03b10 . In this case one has Z = ci1 H i1 + * * *+ cis H is\nP \u2032\nand some coefficients are greater than 1. As in the proof for (1), the gradation g =\ngk\nP\ni1\nis\n\u2032\ngiven by H + * * * + H is of type \u03b10 and satisfies n = k>0 gk . The assumption implies\nP \u2032\nthat g =\ngk is of \u03bd \u2032 -kind with \u03bd \u2032 < \u03bd. Therefore n is \u03bd \u2032 -step nilpotent and not \u03bd-step\nnilpotent.\n\u0003\nThis proposition means that, to study the nilmanifold attached to GLA, it is enough\nto consider gradations of type \u03b10 .\n\n3\n\nRicci curvatures of the attached nilmanifolds\n\nIn this section we calculate the Ricci curvatures of the nilmanifolds attached to GLA. The\nRicci curvatures can be written by using the bracket products and the grade-reversing\nCartan involutions.\nLemma 3.1 The nilmanifolds (n, B\u03c3 ) attached to GLA satisfy that\n(1) B\u03c3 ([U, V ], W ) = \u2212B\u03c3 (V, [\u03c3U, W ]) for every U, V, W \u2208 n,\n(2) (adU )\u2217 V = [V, \u03c3U]n for every U, V \u2208 n.\nThese formulae can be checked easily but quite useful for calculating the Ricci curvatures.\n(k)\n\nDefinition 3.2 Let {Ei } be an orthonormal basis of gk . We call Zk :=\nthe k-th mean curvature vector.\n\nP\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n[\u03c3(Ei ), Ei ]\n\nIt is easy to show that Zk is independent of the choice of orthonormal basis. Furthermore, Lemma 3.1 leads that the vector H0 := Z1 + * * * + Z\u03bd coincides with the mean\ncurvature vector of the solvmanifold (a + n, B\u03c3 ).\n\n6\n\n\f(k)\n\nLemma 3.3 Let {Ei } be an orthonormal basis of gk and define the operators Ak and\nBk on n by\nX (k)\nX\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\nAk (U) :=\n[Ei , [\u03c3Ei , U]], Bk (U) :=\n[\u03c3Ei , [Ei , U]].\nThen, for every Ul \u2208 gl , we have\n\n(1) Ak (Ul ) = Bk (Ul ) \u2212 [Zk , Ul ],\n(2) Bk (Ul ) = Ak+l (Ul ) = Bk+l (Ul ) \u2212 [Zk+l , Ul ].\nProof. (1) is a direct consequence of the Jacobi identity. To show (2), we need an\n(k+l)\n(k)\northonormal basis {Ej\n} of gk+l . It follows from [Ei , Ul ] \u2208 gk+l that\nX\n(k)\n(k)\nBm (Ul ) =\n[\u03c3Ei , [Ei , Ul ]]\ni\n\n=\n\nXX\ni\n\n=\n=\n\nX\n\n(k+l)\n\n(k+l)\n\niEj\n\n]\n\nj\n\nXX\ni\n\n(k)\n\n[\u03c3Ei , h[Ei , Ul ], Ej\n(k)\n\n(k+l)\n\n[\u03c3(hEi , [\u03c3Ul , Ej\n\n(k)\n\n(k+l)\n\n]iEi ), Ej\n\n]\n\nj\n\n(k+l)\n\n[\u03c3([\u03c3Ul , Ej\n\n(k+l)\n\n]), Ej\n\n]\n\nj\n\n= Al+m (Ul ).\nThis concludes the lemma.\n\n\u0003\n\nBy definition, Bk (Ul ) = 0 if k + l > \u03bd. Therefore one can determine Ak and Bk by\nthese recursion formulae. These operators play important roles for calculating the Ricci\ncurvatures of our nilmanifolds.\nTheorem 3.4 Let (n, B\u03c3 ) be the nilmanifold attached to GLA and Ricn be the Ricci\ncurvature. Then, for every Ul \u2208 gl , one has\nX\nX\nAm (Ul ),\nAm (Ul ) + (1/2)\n(1) Ricn(Ul ) = \u2212(1/4)\nm<l\n\nm>l\n\nP\n(2) Ricn(U1 ) = (1/2) (1 \u2212 k)[Zk , U1 ],\n\n(3) Ricn(U2 ) = (1/4)\n\nP\n(2 \u2212 k)[Zk , U2 ].\n\nProof. Let {Ei } be an orthonormal basis of gk . Direct calculations lead that\n(\nX\nX\n\u2212Am for m < l,\nadEi \u25e6 (adEi )\u2217 (Ul ) = \u2212\n[Ei , [\u03c3Ei , Ul ]n] =\n0\nfor m \u2265 l.\n7\n\n\fFurthermore, one can see that\nX\n(adEi )\u2217 \u25e6 adEi (Ul ) = \u2212Bm (Ul ) = \u2212Al+m (Ul ).\n\nThus Proposition 1.4 concludes (1). One can calculate Ak (U1 ) and Ak (U2 ) by using\nLemma 3.3 as follows:\nAk (U1 ) = Bk (U1 ) \u2212 [Zk , U1 ]\n= (1/2)Bk+1(U1 ) \u2212 [Zk , U1 ] \u2212 [Zk+1 , U1 ]\n= ***\n= \u2212[Zk + Zk+1 + * * * + Z\u03bd , U1 ],\nAk (U2 ) = \u2212[Zk , U2 ] \u2212 [Zk+2 , U2 ] \u2212 [Zk+4 , U2 ] \u2212 * * * .\nBy substituting these formulae for the equation (1), we conclude (2) and (3).\n\n4\n\n\u0003\n\nMean curvature vectors\n\nAs we saw in the previous section, one needs to know the mean curvature vectors Z1 , . . . , Z\u03bd\nfor calculating the Ricci curvature of the nilmanifolds attached to GLA. In this section\nwe investigate these vectors.\nWe call H\u03b1 \u2208 a the root vector of a root \u03b1 if B\u03c3 (H\u03b1 , H) = \u03b1(H) for every H \u2208 a. Our\nroot vectors are the negative of the usual ones, since B\u03c3 = \u2212B on a \u00d7 a. We employ this\ndefinition for convenience. Let \u2206k := {\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206 | \u03b1(Z) = k}.\nLemma 4.1 The k-th mean curvature vector Zk satisfies (1) Zk =\nand (2) B\u03c3 (Zk , Z) = k dim gk .\n\nP\n\n\u03b1\u2208\u2206k (dim g\u03b1 )H\u03b1 ,\n\nProof. Let E \u2208 g\u03b1 be a unit vector. Then, Lemma 3.1 follows that H\u03b1 = [\u03c3E, E], which\nconcludes (1). To show (2) we need {Ei }, an orthonormal basis of gk . One can see that\nX\nX\nB\u03c3 (Zk , Z) = B\u03c3 ( [\u03c3Ei , Ei ], Z) =\nB\u03c3 (Ei , [Z, Ei ])\nX\n=\nB\u03c3 (Ei , kEi ) = k dim gk .\nThis concludes (2).\n\n\u0003\n\nWe now determine the mean curvature vectors of our nilmanifolds. Recall that we can\nassume, without loss of generality, that Z is a linear combination of {H i }, the dual basis of\nthe simple roots \u03a0 = {\u03b1i }. We also recall that the Weyl group is generated by {s1 , . . . , sr },\nwhere sj denotes the reflection of a with respect to the hyperplane {H \u2208 a | \u03b1j (H) = 0}.\nTheorem 4.2 Let (n, B\u03c3 ) be the nilmanifold attached to GLA and assume that the characteristic element is Z = ci1 H i1 + ci2 H i2 + * * * + cis H is with ci1 , . . . , cis > 0. Then,\n8\n\n\f(1) Zk = zi1 H i1 + * * * + zis H is with zij =\n\nP\n\n\u03b2\u2208\u2206k (dim g\u03b2 )B\u03c3 (H\u03b1ij , H\u03b2 ),\n\nfor every k, and\n\nP\n(2) H0 = hi1 H i1 + * * * + his H is with hij = \u03b2\u2208\u2206ij (dim g\u03b2 )B\u03c3 (H\u03b1ij , H\u03b2 ), where \u2206ij :=\n{\u03b2 \u2208 \u2206 | \u03b2(Z) = \u03b2(H ij ) > 0}. Furthermore, hij > 0.\nProof. (1): First of all we show that Zk \u2208 V := RH i1 + RH i2 + * * * + RH is . Since the\northogonal complement of V in a is spanned by root vectors {H\u03b1j | j 6= i1 , . . . , is }, it is\nsufficient to show that B\u03c3 (Zk , H\u03b1j ) = 0 for every j 6= i1 , . . . , is . By the definition of Weyl\ngroup, this condition is equivalent to sj (Zk ) = Zk . Take j 6= i1 , . . . , is . Because sj acts\ntrivially on V , one has sj (Z) = Z and hence sj (\u2206k ) = \u2206k . This and Lemma 4.1 imply\nthat\nX\nX\nX\n(dim gsj (\u03b2) )Hsj (\u03b2) = Zk .\n(dim g\u03b2 )sj (H\u03b2 ) =\n(dim g\u03b2 )H\u03b2 ) =\nsj (Zk ) = sj (\n\u03b2\u2208\u2206k\n\n\u03b2\u2208\u2206k\n\n\u03b2\u2208\u2206k\n\nNote that the multiplicities of roots, dim g\u03b2 , are invariant under the action of the Weyl\ngroup. Therefore we have B\u03c3 (Zk , H\u03b1j ) = 0, and hence Zk \u2208 V . Each coefficient of\nZk = zi1 H i1 + * * * + zis H is can be determined by\nzij = \u03b1ij (Zk ) = \u03b1ij (\n\nX\n\n(dim g\u03b2 )H\u03b2 ) =\n\nX\n\n(dim g\u03b2 )B\u03c3 (H\u03b1ij , H\u03b2 ).\n\n\u03b2\u2208\u2206k\n\n\u03b2\u2208\u2206k\n\n(2): Let \u2206\u2032 := {\u03b2 \u2208 \u2206 | \u03b2(Z) > 0}. Because of (1), one can write H0 = hi1 H i1 + * * * +\nP\nhis H is with hij = \u03b2\u2208\u2206\u2032 (dim g\u03b2 )B\u03c3 (H\u03b1ij , H\u03b2 ). We here claim that sij preserves \u2206\u2032 \u2212 \u2206ij .\nP\nnk \u03b1k so that nit > 0 for some t 6= j. The\nFor every \u03b2 \u2208 \u2206\u2032 \u2212 \u2206ij , one can write \u03b2 =\nformula of the reflection\nh\u03b1i , \u03b2i\nsij (\u03b2) = \u03b2 \u2212 2 j\n\u03b1i\nh\u03b2, \u03b2i j\nleads that the \u03b1it -coefficient of sij (\u03b2) is also nit . Hence, sij (\u03b2)(Z) \u2265 nit > 0 and\nsij (\u03b2)(Z) \u2265 nit + \u03b2(H ij ) > \u03b2(H ij ). This completes the claim. Thus, the similar argument as (1) leads that\nX\n(dim g\u03b2 )B\u03c3 (H\u03b1ij , H\u03b2 ) = 0,\n\u03b2\u2208\u2206\u2032 \u2212\u2206ij\n\nwhich concludes the first part of (2). Now we show that hij > 0. There might exist \u03b2 \u2208 \u2206ij\nsuch that B\u03c3 (H\u03b1ij , H\u03b2 ) < 0. But, for such \u03b2, one has sij (\u03b2) \u2208 \u2206ij and B\u03c3 (H\u03b1ij , sij (H\u03b2 )) =\n\u2212B\u03c3 (H\u03b1ij , H\u03b2 ). Therefore every negative term cancels with another term. Hence, we\nP\ngot hij =\n(dim g\u03b2 )B\u03c3 (H\u03b1ij , H\u03b2 ), where \u03b2 run through {\u03b2 \u2208 \u2206ij | B\u03c3 (H\u03b1ij , H\u03b2 ) >\n0, sij (\u03b2) 6\u2208 \u2206ij }. Since this set contains \u03b1ij , one has hij > 0.\n\u0003\nNext we show a remarkable property of mean curvature vectors, which is quite useful\nfor calculating the Ricci curvatures of our nilmanifolds and solvmanifolds.\n9\n\n\fTheorem 4.3 Let (n, B\u03c3 ) be the nilmanifold attached to GLA with the characteristic\nelement Z. Then the mean curvature vectors Zk satisfy\nX\nkZk = Z.\n2\nk>0\n\nP\nProof. It is enough to show that h2 kZk , Hi = hZ, Hi for every H \u2208 a. Let Ei be an\northonormal basis of g. By the definition of the Killing form, one has\nX\nhZ, Hi = tr(adZ \u25e6 adH ) =\nh[Z, [H, Ei ]], Ei i.\ni\n\nOne can assume that each Ei is contained in the root spaces. Denote by E\u03b1 \u2208 g\u03b1 an unit\nvector. Thus we have\nX\nhZ, Hi =\nh[Z, [H, E\u03b1]], E\u03b1 i dim g\u03b1\n\u03b1\u2208\u2206\n\n=\n\nX\n\n\u03b1(Z)\u03b1(H) dim g\u03b1 .\n\n\u03b1\u2208\u2206\n\nOn the other hand, Lemma 4.1 (1) leads that\nX\nX\nX\n\u03b1(Z)(dim g\u03b1 )H\u03b1 =\n\u03b1(Z)(dim g\u03b1 )H\u03b1 .\n2\nkZk = 2\n\u03b1\u2208\u2206\n\n\u03b1\u2208\u2206+\n\nTherefore one can easily see that\nX\nX\nh2\nkZk , Hi =\n\u03b1(Z)(dim g\u03b1 )\u03b1(H),\n\u03b1\n\nwhich completes the proof.\n\n\u0003\n\nCombining this theorem with Theorem 3.4, the Ricci curvatures of our nilmanifolds\ncan be written easier.\nCorollary 4.4 For the nilmanifold (n, B\u03c3 ) attached to GLA, we have\nP\n(1) Ricn(U1 ) = \u2212(1/4)U1 + (1/2) [Zk , U1 ] for U1 \u2208 g1 ,\nP\n(2) Ricn(U2 ) = \u2212(1/4)U2 + (1/2) [Zk , U2 ] for U2 \u2208 g2 .\n\n5\n\nCurvature properties of the solvable extensions\n\nWe now consider one-dimensional solvable extensions of the nilmanifolds (n, B\u03c3 ) attached\nto GLA, and investigate their curvature properties and Einstein conditions. We consider\nthe following solvable extensions:\ns := RH + n,\n\nh, ic := cB\u03c3 |RH\u00d7RH + B\u03c3 |n\u00d7n,\n10\n\n\fwhere c > 0, H \u2208 a and adH |n has only positive eigenvalues.\nA solvmanifold (s, h, i) is called a Carnot space if dim[s, s]\u22a5 = 1 and there exists\nA0 \u2208 [s, s]\u22a5 such that every eigenvalue of adA0 on [s, s] is a positive integer (see [19]). We\ncall a Carnot space is of (k + 1)-step if k is the maximum of the eigenvalues of adA0 .\nProposition 5.1 The above solvmanifold (s = RH + n, h, ic ) is of Iwasawa-type. This\nsolvmanifold is a Carnot space if every eigenvalue of adaH |n is a positive integer for some\na > 0.\nThe Ricci curvatures of solvable extensions can be calculated as follows.\nLemma 5.2 Denote the Ricci curvatures of (s = RH + n, h, ic ) and (n, B\u03c3 ) by Ricc and\nRicn, respectively. Let ad and adg be the adjoint operators of s and g, respectively. We\nnormalize H to be the mean curvature vector of (s, h, i1 = B\u03c3 ). Then,\n(1) Ricc (H) = \u2212(tr(adH )2 )/(c * tr(adgH )2 ) * H,\n(2) if [H, g0 ] = 0, then Ricc (H) = \u2212(1/2c)H,\n(3) Ricc (U) = Ricn(U) \u2212 (1/c)[H, U] for every U \u2208 n,\nP\n(4) Ricc (U1 ) = \u2212(1/4)U1 + [(1/2) Zk \u2212 (1/c)H, U1 ] for every U1 \u2208 g1 ,\nP\n(5) Ricc (U2 ) = \u2212(1/4)U2 + [(1/2) Zk \u2212 (1/c)H, U2 ] for every U2 \u2208 g2 .\n\nProof.\n(1): Proposition 1.3 leads that Ricc (H) = \u2212(tr(adH )2 /|H|2) * H. By the\ndefinition of the inner product, we have\n|H|2 = c * B\u03c3 (H, H) = c * tr(adgH )2 .\n(2): If [H, g0 ] = 0, then we have\ntr(adgH )2 = tr(adgH |n)2 + tr(adgH |g0 )2 + tr(adgH |\u03c3(n) )2 = 2tr(adH )2 .\nWe finish the proof of (2) by substituting this for (1).\n(3): Note that the mean curvature vector of (s, h, ic) is (1/c)H. Thus Proposition 1.3\nleads that\nRicc (U) = Ricn(U) \u2212 (tr(ad(1/c)H )/|(1/c)H|2) * [(1/c)H, U]\nfor U \u2208 n. Recall that hH, Ai1 = tr(adA ) for every A \u2208 RH, since H is the mean curvature\nvector of (s, h, i1). Thus one has\n|(1/c)H|2 = h(1/c)H, (1/c)Hic = (1/c)hH, Hi1 = (1/c)tr(adH ) = tr(ad(1/c)H ).\nThis completes the proof of (3).\n(4) and (5): They are direct consequences of (3) and Corollary 4.4.\n\n\u0003\n\nNext we study the Einstein condition of the solvable extension. The following theorem\nimplies that there is the only one natural choice of the solvable extension.\n11\n\n\fTheorem 5.3 Let (n, h, i) be the nilmanifold attached to a graded Lie algebra of type \u03b10\nand consider the above solvable extension (s = RH + n, h, ic ). Then we have the following:\n(1) If (s, h, ic ) is Einstein, then Ricc (H) = \u2212(1/2c)H.\n(2) Assume that n is abelian. Then (s, h, ic ) is Einstein if and only if H k H0 .\n(3) Assume that n is not abelian. If (s, h, ic) is Einstein, then c = 2 and H k H0 .\nProof. First of all, we normalize H to be the mean curvature vector of (s, h, i1 = B\u03c3 ).\n(1): Assume that (s, h, ic) is Einstein with Einstein constant s. We have only to show\n[H, g0 ] = 0, because of Lemma 5.2 (2). Let U1 \u2208 g1 . Einstein condition and Lemma 5.2\n(4) lead that\nX\n[\u2212(1/4)Z + (1/2)\nZk \u2212 (1/c)H, U1 ] = Ricc (U1 ) = sU1 = [sZ, U1 ].\n\nP\nThus, the element U := \u2212(1/4)Z + (1/2) Zk \u2212 (1/c)H \u2212 sZ acts trivially on g1 . By\nassumption, the gradation is of type \u03b10 , that is, g is generated by g1 and the gradereversing Cartan involution. Therefore, \u03c3(U) = \u2212U and [U, g1 ] = 0 lead that [U, g] = 0.\nWe conclude that\nX\n\u2212 (1/4)Z + (1/2)\nZk \u2212 (1/c)H = sZ,\n(5.1)\n\nbecause g is semisimple. Theorem 4.2 leads that [Z, g0 ] = 0 and [Zk , g0 ] = 0, which\nconclude [H, g0 ] = 0.\n(2): We consider the case that n is abelian. Note that, in this case, we have H0 =\nP\nZk = Z1 = (1/2)Z (the last equality follows from Theorem 4.3). If (s, h, ic ) is Einstein\nwith Einstein constant s, the equation (5.1) implies that H is parallel to H0 . To show the\nconverse, we assume that H k H0 . One has Ricc (H0 ) = \u2212(1/2c)H0, because of [H0 , g0 ] = 0\nand Lemma 5.2 (2). One also has\nRicc (U1 ) = \u2212(1/c)[H, U1 ] = \u2212(1/2c)[Z, U1 ] = \u2212(1/2c)U1 ,\n\nbecause of Ricn = 0 and Lemma 5.2 (3). Therefore (s, h, ic ) is Einstein with Einstein\nconstant \u2212(1/2c).\n(3): We consider the case that n is not abelian (that is, g2 6= 0) and (s, h, ic) is\nEinstein. For U1 \u2208 g1 and U2 \u2208 g2 , Einstein condition and Lemma 5.2 (4), (5) imply that\nX\nX\n[(1/2)\nZk \u2212 (1/c)H, U1 ] = sU1 , [(1/2)\nZk \u2212 (1/c)H, U2 ] = sU2 ,\n\nwhere the Einstein constant is \u2212(1/4) + s. On the other hand, since our gradation is of\nP\ntype \u03b10 , one has g2 = [g1 , g1 ]. This implies that (1/2) Zk \u2212 (1/c)H acts on g2 as 2s * id.\nP\nTherefore s = 0 and H k Zk = H0 . Recall that we normalized H to be mean curvature\nvector, which leads that H = H0 and c = 2.\n\u0003\n12\n\n\fIn the case that n is abelian, that is, the gradation is of first kind, the Einstein space\n(s, h, ic ) is obviously isometric to the real hyperbolic space, which has been well-known.\nIn the case that n is not abelian, our class of solvmanifolds contains many new examples\nof Einstein solvmanifolds. We will see examples in the latter sections.\n\n6\n\nSolvmanifolds attached to graded Lie algebras\n\nTheorem 5.3 states that the following solvable extension is natural:\nDefinition 6.1 Let (n, B\u03c3 ) be the nilmanifold attached to a graded Lie algebra and H0\nthe mean curvature vector of (a + n, B\u03c3 ). We call (s = RH0 + n, h, i2 ) the solvmanifold\nattached to a graded Lie algebra.\nNote that the solvmanifold attached to GLA is a Carnot space, because of Theorem\n4.2. On the Ricci curvatures of these solvmanifolds, Lemma 5.2 immediately leads the\nfollowing:\nTheorem 6.2 The Ricci curvature Ric of a solvmanifold attached to a graded Lie algebra,\n(s = RH0 + n, h, i2), satisfies that\n(1) Ric = \u2212(1/4)id on RH0 + g1 + g2 ,\n(2) Ric(U) = Ricn(U) \u2212 (1/2)[H0, U] for every U \u2208 n.\nWe here mention some relations between our solvmanifolds and symmetric spaces of\nnoncompact type.\nP\u03bd\nLet us consider g =\nk=\u2212\u03bd gk the longest gradation. Here, we call the gradation\nP\nlongest if the characteristic element Z is a regular element. In this case, n = k>0 gk =\nP\n\u03b1\u2208\u2206+ g\u03b1 coincides with the nilpotent part of the Iwasawa decomposition of g. Furthermore, the solvmanifold (a + n, h, i), where h, i := 2B\u03c3 |a\u00d7a + B\u03c3 |n\u00d7n, is nothing but\nthe symmetric space of noncompact type, G/K, associated from g. This is a standard\nEinstein solvmanifold, whose rank one reduction coincides with our solvable extension\n(RH0 +n, h, i2 ). Thus, the natural solvable extension is Einstein if the gradation is longest.\nP\nLet us consider the gradation g = \u03bdk=\u2212\u03bd gk , which is not necessarily longest. In this\nP\nP\ncase we have n = k>0 gk \u2282 \u03b1\u2208\u2206+ g\u03b1 . Therefore, our solvable Lie algebra RH0 + n is\na subalgebra of the solvable part of the Iwasawa decomposition. Thus one can see that\nour solvmanifold (RH0 + n, h, i2 ) is a Riemannian submanifold in a symmetric space of\nnoncompact type.\nBecause of the above observation, we have to investigate when our solvmanifold is\ntotally geodesic, or the rank one reduction of a totally geodesic submanifold. As a result,\nthis can only happen if the gradation is longest.\n13\n\n\fP\nP\nProposition 6.3 Let g =\ngk be a gradation and n := k>0 gk . If n is the nilradical\nof a totally geodesic submanifold, then the gradation is longest.\nProof. Assume that a\u2032 + n gives a totally geodesic submanifold and RH0 + n is the rank\none reduction of it. Denote by g = k + p the Cartan decomposition and \u03c0 : g \u2192 p the\nnatural projection. One knows that V := \u03c0(a\u2032 + n) is a Lie triple system. If we denote by\nZ the characteristic element of our gradation, we have\nV = a\u2032 +\n\nX\n\np\u03b1 .\n\n\u03b1(Z)>0\n\nThe totally geodesic submanifold coincides with the orbit of a Lie group with Lie algebra\n[V, V ] + V .\nWe here claim that [V, V ] + V = g. Let us take \u03b1 such that \u03b1(Z) > 0. Theorem\n4.2 leads \u03b1(H0 ) > 0, and thus one has [V, V ] \u2283 [H0 , p\u03b1 ] = k\u03b1 . This implies g\u22121 + g1 \u2282\n[V, V ] + V . Since we assumed that the gradation is of type \u03b10 , we conclude the claim.\nNow it is easy to see from \u03c0(a\u2032 + n) = p that the totally geodesic submanifold is the\nentire space, and Z is regular.\n\u0003\n\n7\n\nTwo-step case\n\nIn this section we see that every solvmanifold attached to a graded Lie algebra of second\nkind is Einstein. Most of those Einstein solvmanifolds have the eigenvalue type (1 <\n2 ; d1 , d2 ), but some of them have another eigenvalue type. We refer [13] for the explicit\nclassification list of second kind graded Lie algebras.\nTheorem 7.1 Every solvmanifold (s, h, i) attached to a graded Lie algebra of second kind\nis Einstein.\nProof. Since s = RH0 + g1 + g2 , this is a direct consequence of Theorem 6.2.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe study their eigenvalue types. For a graded Lie algebra of second kind, g =\ni\ni\nj\nk=\u22122 gk , the characteristic element satisfies either Z = H or Z = H + H . Recall\nthat {H i } is the dual basis of the simple roots. If Z = H i , Theorem 4.2 leads that\nZ k H0 . In this case the eigenvalue type is (1 < 2 ; d1 , d2 ), by the definition of the\ncharacteristic element. If Z = H i + H j , Theorem 4.2 states only that H0 = aH i + bH j .\nIn this case unusual eigenvalue type may occur.\nLet us consider the root system is of Ar -type. In this case Z = H i + H j gives a second\nkind gradation. One can calculate the mean curvature vector directly,\n\nP2\n\nH0 = Z1 + Z2 = jH i + (r + 1 \u2212 i)H j ,\n14\n\n\fup to scalar. If i + j = r + 1 then the eigenvalue type is (1 < 2 ; d1 , d2 ). If i + j < r + 1,\nthe eigenvalue type is (j < r + 1 \u2212 i < r + 1 \u2212 i + j ; d1 , d2 , d3 ). These arguments imply\nthat\nCorollary 7.2 For every 0 < \u03bc1 < \u03bc2 , there exists a standard Einstein solvmanifold\n(s, h, i) with two-step nilpotent n, whose eigenvalue type is (\u03bc1 < \u03bc2 < \u03bc1 + \u03bc2 ; d1 , d2 , d3 ).\nWe see a simple example here. Consider the nilpotent subalgebra of sl(n + m + l, R),\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f2 0 X Z\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nn := \uf8ed 0 0 Y \uf8f8 | X \u2208 Mn,m (R), Y \u2208 Mm,l (R), Z \u2208 Mn,l (R) .\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n\uf8f3\n0 0 0\n\nLet us consider the gradation of sl(n + m + l, R) of second kind, given by the above block\ndecomposition. Then (n, B\u03c3 ) coincides with the nilmanifold attached to this gradation,\ntherefore it has an Einstein solvable extension.\nIn this case, the root system is of An+m+l\u22121 -type, and direct calculations lead that\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n(m + l) * 1n\n1\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nHn =\n\u2212n * 1m\n\uf8f8,\n\uf8ed\nn+m+l\n\u2212n * 1l\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nl * 1n\n1\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nHm =\nl * 1m\n\uf8f8.\n\uf8ed\nn+m+l\n\u2212(n + m) * 1l\n\nThe characteristic element is Z = H n + H m . The solvmanifold RZ + n is a three-step\nCarnot space, but this is not what we want. Our Einstein solvable extension is RH0 + n,\nwhere H0 is parallel to (n + m)H n + (m + l)H n+m . This is (n + 2m + l + 1)-step Carnot\nspace if n + m and m + l have no common devisor, whereas n is two-step nilpotent.\nWe also note that, in case n = l = 1, this nilmanifold is nothing but the Heisenberg Lie\nalgebra, and the constructed Einstein solvmanifold is isometric to the complex hyperbolic\nspace. In case n = l, the eigenvalue type of the Einstein solvmanifold is (1 < 2; nm +\nml, nl). In case n 6= l, adH0 has three distinct eigenvalues.\n\n8\n\nExamples of Einstein spaces with higher steps\n\nIn this section we investigate the solvmanifolds attached to graded Lie algebras of third\nkind and of fourth kind.\nProposition 8.1 Assume a graded Lie algebra is of third kind and each Zk is parallel to\nZ. Then the attached solvmanifold (s, h, i) is Einstein if and only if dim g1 = 2 dim g2 .\n15\n\n\fProof. Recall that Theorem 6.2 states Ric = \u2212(1/4) * id on RH0 + g1 + g2 . Therefore\n(s, h, i) is Einstein if and only if Ric(U3 ) = \u2212(1/4)U3 for every U3 \u2208 g3 . One can calculate\nthis as follows:\nRicn(U3 ) = (1/4)[Z1, U3 ] + (1/4)[Z2, U3 ],\nRic(U3 ) = Ricn(U3 ) \u2212 (1/2)[Z1 + Z2 + Z3 , U3 ]\n= \u2212(1/4)[Z1, U3 ] \u2212 (1/4)[Z2, U3 ] \u2212 (1/2)[Z3, U3 ]\n= \u2212(1/4)((dim g1 + 2 dim g2 + 6 dim g3 )/B\u03c3 (Z, Z)) * [Z, U3 ]\n= \u2212(1/4)(3 dim g1 + 6 dim g2 + 18 dim g3 )/B\u03c3 (Z, Z)) * U3 .\nThus, Ric(U3 ) = \u2212(1/4)U3 if and only if\n3 dim g1 + 6 dim g2 + 18 dim g3 = B\u03c3 (Z, Z) = 2(dim g1 + 4 dim g2 + 9 dim g3 ),\nthat is, dim g1 = 2 dim g2 .\n\n\u0003\n\nNext we state the similar result for four-step case. Proof is also similar.\nProposition 8.2 Assume a graded Lie algebra is of fourth kind and each Zk is parallel\nto Z. Then the attached solvmanifold (s, h, i) is Einstein if and only if dim g1 = 3 dim g3\nand dim g1 + 4 dim g4 = 2 dim g2 .\nThese propositions provide examples of Einstein solvmanifolds whose nilradicals are\nof three-step or four-step.\nTheorem 8.3 The solvmanifolds attached to the following graded Lie algebras are Einstein. The eigenvalue types of the constructed Einstein solvmanifolds are as follows.\ng\n\n\u2206\n\nZ\n\neigenvalue type\n\ng2(2)\ngC2\nf4(4)\nfC4\ne6(2)\ne7(\u22125)\ne8(\u221224)\ne6(6)\neC6\nf4(4)\nfC4\ne6(2)\ne7(\u22125)\ne8(\u221224)\n\nG2\nG2\nF4\nF4\nF4\nF4\nF4\nE6\nE6\nF4\nF4\nF4\nF4\nF4\n\nH1\nH1\nH2\nH2\nH2\nH2\nH2\nH4\nH4\nH3\nH3\nH3\nH3\nH3\n\n(1 < 2 < 3 ; 2, 1, 2)\n(1 < 2 < 3 ; 4, 2, 4)\n(1 < 2 < 3 ; 12, 6, 2)\n(1 < 2 < 3 ; 24, 12, 4)\n(1 < 2 < 3 ; 18, 9, 2)\n(1 < 2 < 3 ; 30, 15, 2)\n(1 < 2 < 3 ; 54, 27, 2)\n(1 < 2 < 3 ; 18, 9, 2)\n(1 < 2 < 3 ; 36, 18, 4)\n(1 < 2 < 3 < 4 ; 6, 9, 2, 3)\n(1 < 2 < 3 < 4 ; 12, 18, 4, 6)\n(1 < 2 < 3 < 4 ; 12, 12, 4, 3)\n(1 < 2 < 3 < 4 ; 24, 18, 8, 3)\n(1 < 2 < 3 < 4 ; 48, 30, 16, 3)\n16\n\n\fProof. One has to check the relations of the dimensions. One can calculate dim gk by\ncounting roots and their multiplicities (one can see the table of multiplicities in [21]). \u0003\n\n9\n\nThe case of low rank\n\nIn this section we mention the following problem: for a given semisimple Lie algebra g,\nis every attached solvmanifold Einstein? The answer is yes, if the rank of the associated\nsymmetric space (g, k) is low.\nIf the rank of (g, k) is one, it is trivial. In this case, g has only one gradation, which\nis longest, and the attached solvmanifold is the entire symmetric space.\nProposition 9.1 Assume that the rank of (g, k) is two, that is, g is one of the following:\nsl3 (R), sl3 (C), su\u2217 (6), e6(\u221226) , so(5, C), so(2, n + 2), g2(2) , gC2 .\nThen, for every gradation of g, the attached solvmanifold is Einstein.\nProof. Let {\u03b11 , \u03b12 } be the set of simple roots. There are three gradations, given by H 1 ,\nH 2 and H 1 + H 2 . If the characteristic element is H 1 + H 2 , the gradation is longest and\nthus the attached solvmanifold is Einstein. If the characteristic element is H 1 or H 2 , the\ngradation is of first kind, second kind or third kind. The solvmanifold attached to first\nkind or second kind gradation is Einstein (Theorems 6.2, 7.1). The third kind gradation is\nobtained by G2 -type root system, whose attached solvmanifolds are Einstein by Theorem\n8.3.\n\u0003\nSimilarly, we have the following:\nProposition 9.2 If the root system of (g, k) is of A3 -type, that is, g = sl4 (R), sl4 (C) or\nsu\u2217 (8), every attached solvmanifold is Einstein.\n\n10\n\nRank one reduction of noncompact symmetric spaces\n\nIn this section we study the mean curvature vectors of noncompact symmetric spaces. For\nthe graded Lie algebra with characteristic element Z := H 1 + * * * + H r , one knows that n\nis the nilpotent part of the Iwasawa decomposition and the solvmanifold (a + n, h, i) is a\nsymmetric space.\nProposition 10.1 The mean curvature vector of the above solvmanifold (a + n, h, i) is\nH0 = h1 H 1 + * * * + hr H r , where hi = (dim g\u03b1i + 4 dim g2\u03b1i )B\u03c3 (H\u03b1i , H\u03b1i ).\n\n17\n\n\fProof. We apply Theorem 4.2 (2). In this case \u2206i := {\u03b2 | \u03b2(Z) = \u03b2(H i ) > 0} consists of\n\u03b1i and 2\u03b1i (if exists). Therefore,\nhi = (dim g\u03b1i )B\u03c3 (H\u03b1i , H\u03b1i ) + (dim g2\u03b1i )B\u03c3 (H2\u03b1i , H2\u03b1i ).\nProposition is completed by H2\u03b1i = 2H\u03b1i .\n\n\u0003\n\nThis Proposition implies that, if every root has the same length, then H0 is parallel to\nZ. It is remarkable that H0 may not parallel to Z even for symmetric spaces. Furthermore,\nas we saw in Propositions 8.1 and 8.2, the Einstein condition requires some equalities of\ndimensions. It seem to be mysterious that symmetric spaces automatically satisfy these\nconditions.\n\nReferences\n[1] D. V. Alekseevskii, Homogeneous Riemannian spaces of negative curvature, Mat.
