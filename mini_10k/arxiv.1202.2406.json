We approach the problem of finding the sharp sufficient\ncondition of the boundedness of all two weight Calder\u00f3n\u2013Zygmund operators. We solve this problem in L2 by writing a formula for a Bellman\nfunction of the problem.\n\n1. Introduction\n1.1. Preliminaries. In this paper we give a simple Bellman function solution of the so-called \"bump conjecture\" for the two weight estimates of the\nsingular integral operators.\nThe original (still open) question about two weight estimates for the singular integral operators is to find a necessary and sufficient condition on the\nweights u and v such that a Calder\u00f3n\u2013Zygmund operator T : Lp (u) \u2192 Lp (v)\nis bounded, i.e. the inequality\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\np\n(1.1)\n|T f | vdx \u2264 C |f |p udx\n\u2200f \u2208 Lp (u)\nholds.\nIn the one weight case v = u the famous Muckenhoupt condition is necessary and sufficient for (1.1)\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013p/p\u2032\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u2212p\u2032 /p\nsup |I|\n(A2 )\n<\u221e\nvdx\n|I|\nv\ndx\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nwhere the supremum is taken over all cubes I. More precisely, this condition\nis sufficient for all Calder\u00f3n\u2013Zygmund operators, and is also necessary for\nclassical (interesting) Calder\u00f3n\u2013Zygmund operators, such as Hilbert transform, Riesz transform (vector-valued, when all Riesz transforms are considered together), Beurling\u2013Ahlfors operator.\nThe inequality (1.1) is equivalent to the boundedness of the operator\nMv1/p T Mu\u22121/p in the non-weighted Lp ; here M\u03c6 is the multiplication oper\u2032\nator, M\u03c6 f = \u03c6f . Denoting w = u\u2212p /p we can rewrite the problem in the\nsymmetric form as the Lp boundedness of Mv1/p T Mw1/p\u2032 .\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. 42B20, 42B35, 47A30.\nKey words and phrases.

VOLBERG\n\nSo the problem can be stated as: Describe all weights (i.e. non-negative\nfunctions) v, w such that the operator Mv1/p T Mw1/p\u2032 is bounded in (the\nnon-weighted) Lp\nNote, that this symmetric formulation is more general than (1.1), because\nin (1.1) it is usually assumed that u and v are locally integrable, but for (1.1)\nto hold for interesting operators (Hilbert Transform, vector Riesz Transform,\nBeurling\u2013Ahlfors Transform, etc.) the function 1/u also has to be locally\nintegrable.\nFor the interesting operators the following two weight analogue of the Ap\ncondition is necessary for the boundedness of the operator Mv1/p T Mw1/p\u2032 :\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013p/p\u2032\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\n\u22121\n\u22121\nsup |I|\n(1.2)\n<\u221e\nvdx\n|I|\nwdx\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nor in the symmetric form\n\u0012\n\u00131/p \u0012\n\u00131/p\u2032\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\n\u22121\n\u22121\nsup |I|\n(1.3)\nvdx\n|I|\nwdx\n<\u221e\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nSimple counterexamples show that this condition is not sufficient for the\nboundedness. So a natural way to get a sufficient condition is to replace the\n\u2032\n\u2032\nL1 norms of v and w in (1.3) (or the Lp and Lp norms of v 1/p and w1/p )\nby some stronger Orlicz norms (\"bumping\" the Lp norms).\nNamely, given a Young function \u03a6 and a cube I one can consider the\nnormalized on I Orlicz space L\u03a6 (I) with the norm given by\n\u001b\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u001a\n\u02c6\nf (x) dx\n\u22641 .\nkf k \u03a6 := inf \u03bb > 0 : \u03a6\nL (I)\n\u03bb\n|I|\nI\nAnd it was conjectured (for p = 2) that if the Young functions \u03a61 and \u03a62\nare integrable near infinity,\n\u02c6 \u221e\ndx\n< \u221e, i = 1, 2 ,\n(1.4)\n\u03a6i (x)\nthen the condition\n(1.5)\n\nsup kvk\nI\n\nL\u03a61 (I)\n\nkwk\n\nL\u03a62 (I)\n\n<\u221e\n\nimplies that for any bounded Calder\u00f3n\u2013Zygmund operator T the operator\nMv1/2 T Mw1/2 is bounded in L2 . Usually in the literature a more complicated\n(although equivalent) form of this conjecture was presented, but at least in\nthe case p = 2 condition (1.5) seems more transparent.1\nCondition (1.5) was considered in numerous papers in the attempt to\nprove its universal sufficiency for all Calder\u00f3n\u2013Zygmund operators. The\nreader can find beautiful approaches in [1], [3], [4], [5], [6], [12], [20], [21],\nwhere partial results for some Calder\u00f3n\u2013Zygmund operators were proved\n(note that [21] is about maximal operator and not about Calder\u00f3n\u2013Zygmund\n1The bump condition was also stated for p 6= 2, but in this paper we only deal with\n\nthe case p = 2.\n\n\fA BELLMAN FUNCTION PROOF OF THE L2 BUMP CONJECTURE\n\n3\n\noperators). Finally in [13] the sufficiency of bump condition for all Calder\u00f3n\u2013\nZygmund operators to be bounded was fully proved (and even generalized\nto all p \u2208 (1, \u221e)), although in formally less general situation of the weights.\nSimultaneously and independently the first version of the present paper\n[16] appeared. Slightly earlier the sketch of the approach (with the main\nideas but without much details) was circulated as [15]. A diligent reader\nwill recognize that the approaches in the present paper (and thus in earlier\nversions [15], [16]) and in Lerner's paper [13] are very different, but still have\nsomething in common. This very important common point is the \"coupling\nby the same cube\" feature. It is the main winning idea of [13]. And it is the\nfeature of the present paper (and [15], [16]) as Bellman function approach\nautomatically should have this feature.\n1.2. What is done in the paper. Formally, in this paper we prove the L2\ncase of the bump conjecture using Bellman function method. As it is now\nwell-known, a general Calder\u00f3n\u2013Zygmund operator can be represented as\nan average of dyadic shift and paraproducts, so it is sufficient to prove the\nestimates for such operators, and that is exactly what is done in the paper.\nHowever we think that the results obtained in the paper that were used to\nprove the bump conjecture are of significant interest by themselves; probably\nthey are even more interesting than the solution of the bump conjecture.\nLet us shortly describe what is done in the paper.\n\u2022 First, the Orlicz norm is not easy to work with. We introduce a\nlower bound for the Orlicz norm, which gives a more tractable, in\nour opinion, way to \"bump\" the averages. In particular, it allows\nus to apply the Bellman function method.\n\u2022 The application of the Bellman function method is by now standard.\nThe novelty of the argument belongs to the fact that Bellman function now is defined on an infinite-dimensional space.\n\u2022 The estimates for the Haar shifts and for the paraproducts are reduced to two embedding theorems, so the operators are constructively factorized through l2 . This essentially means that the bump\ncondition is a rather rough one, since in more delicate two weight\nsituations no such factorization appeared to be possible (at least no\nfactorization was found), see, for example, [18], [7].\n\u2022 Namely, it is known, see [19], that in the case of power bumps\n(\u03a6(t) = t1+\u03b5 ) one can insert a Muckenhoupt Ap weight between\nw\u22121 and Cv, so the boundedness follows immediately. For finer\nbumps such insertion of Ap weights is impossible, but the constructive factorization through l2 can be considered the next best thing.\n\u2022 Finally, the main estimates can be directly extended to general\n(non-homogeneous) martingale settings, and can be used in more\ngeneral situations. In particular, a word by word extension of our\nresults gives the proof of the bump conjecture for the Calder\u00f3n\u2013\nZygmund operators on geometrically doubling metric spaces (equipped\n\n\f4\n\nF. NAZAROV, A. REZNIKOV, S. TREIL, AND A. VOLBERG\n\nwith a doubling measure). Indeed, since random \"dyadic\" lattices\ncan be constructed on geometrically doubling metric spaces, and\nrepresentation of Calder\u00f3n\u2013Zygmund operators on such spaces as\nan average of Haar shifts is now known (see, for example, [17]),\neverything follows from our results (see Theorem 2.3 below).\nAcknowledgement. We are grateful to the referee for several helpful remarks.\n1.3. Orlicz norms and distribution functions. Orlicz norm is not very\nconvenient to work with, so we would like to replace it by something more\ntractable.\n1.3.1. A lower\nbound for the Orlicz norm. We start with the remark that\n \u0301\nnotation  \u03010 f (t)dt < \u221e means that the function is integrable near zero.\n\u221e\nf (t)dt < \u221e means that the function is integrable near infinity.\nSimilarly,\nLet \u03a6 be a continuous\nnon-negative increasing convex function such that\n \u0301 +\u221e dt\n<\n+\u221e. Define \u03a8(s) parametrically by \u03a8(s) = \u03a6\u2032 (t)\n\u03a6(0) = 0 and\n\u03a6(t)\nwhen s =\n\n1\n\u03a6(t)\u03a6\u2032 (t)\n\n(t > 0). Then \u03a8(s) is positive and decreasing for s >\n \u0301 ds\n< +\u221e. Indeed, using our\n0 and s\u03a8(s) is increasing. Moreover 0 s\u03a8(s)\nparametrization we can rewrite the last integral as\n\u0013\n\u02c6 +\u221e \u0012\n1\n\u03a6\u2032\u2032 (t)\n+\ndt .\n\u03a6(t) \u03a6\u2032 (t)2\n\nThe first integral converges by our assumption and the second integrand has\na bounded near +\u221e antiderivative \u03a6\u22121\n\u2032 (t) .\nn\nLet w \u2265 0 on I \u2282 R . Define the normalized distribution function N of\nw by\n1\nN (t) = NIw (t) =\n(1.6)\n|{x \u2208 I : w(x) > t}|\n|I|\nLemma 1.1. Let \u03a8 : (0, 1] \u2192 R+ be a decreasing function such that the\nfunction s 7\u2192 s\u03a8(s) is increasing. Let \u03a6 be a Young function and let\n1\n\u03a8(s) \u2264 C\u03a6\u2032 (t)\nwhere s =\n\u03a6(t)\u03a6\u2032 (t)\nfor all sufficiently large t. Then for N = NIw\n\u02c6 \u221e\n(1.7)\nN (t)\u03a8(N (t)) dt \u2264 Ckwk\nn\u03a8 (N ) :=\n0\n\nL\u03a6 (I)\n\n.\n\nProof. The left hand side scales like a norm under multiplication by constants, so it is enough to show that if kwkL\u03a6 (I) \u2264 1, i.e.,\n\u02c6 \u221e\n\u02c6\n1\nN (t)\u03a6\u2032 (t) dt \u2264 1\n\u03a6(w) =\n|I| I\n0\nthen n\u03a8 (N ) is bounded by a constant. Since s\u03a8(s) increases, we may have\ntrouble only at +\u221e It is clear that it suffices to estimate the integral over\n\n\fA BELLMAN FUNCTION PROOF OF THE L2 BUMP CONJECTURE\n\n5\n\nthe set where \u03a8(N (t)) > \u03a6\u2032 (t) but since\n\u03a8 is decreasing this means that\n \u0301 +\u221e\n\u2032\n\u03a6(t)\u22121 dt and we are done. \u0003\nN (t) \u2264 C/(\u03a6(t)\u03a6 (t)), so we get at most\n\nRemark. In fact, for sufficiently regular \u03a6, the converse inequality kwk \u03a6 \u2264\nL\n \u0301\u221e\nC 0 N (t)\u03a8(N (t)) dt holds for any positive decreasing integrable N . To\nsee this, let us consider the family of \u03a6's such that \u03a6(t) = t\u03c1(t) and \u03c1 is\nmonotonically increasing and \"logarithmically concave\" in the sense that\nt\u03c1\u2032 (t)\n\u03c1(t) decreases monotonically when t \u2192 \u221e. We also assume of course that\nlimt\u2192\u221e \u03c1(t) = \u221e and that \u03c1(t) \u2265 1. Let G(t) := N (t)\u03a8(N (t)). When t\ngoes to infinity, N is monotonically decreasing to zero, and hence G is also\nmonotonically decreasing (as s\u03a8(s) increases near zero).\nPut s\u22121 = \u03a6(t)\u03a6\u2032 (t) \u224d t\u03c12 (t) (just because \u03a6\u2032 (t) \u224d \u03c1(t) by our \"logarithmic concavity\" of \u03c1 assumption). Hence s \u2265 c1 (t\u03c12 (t))\u22121 . Now \u03a8 is\ndecreasing by definition, and this implies\n(1.8)\n\n\u03a8(c1 (t\u03c12 (t))\u22121 ) \u2265 \u03a6\u2032 (t) \u224d \u03c1(t) \u2265 c2 \u03c1(t) .\n\nWe now ask an addition to \"logarithmic concavity\", namely:\nt\u03c1\u2032 (t)\nlog \u03c1(t) \u2192 0 .\n\u03c1(t)\n\n(1.9)\n\nDenote r(x) = log(\u03c1(ex )).

Reductions: Haar shifts, paraproducts and embedding\ntheorems\nFirst, let us reduce the problem to its dyadic (martingale) analogue, i.e. to\nthe estimates of the so-called Haar shifts and paraproducts.\nSince a bounded Calder\u00f3n\u2013Zygmund operator can be represented as a\nweighted average (over the random dyadic grids) of Haar shifts and paraproducts and their adjoints, where the weights decay exponentially in complexity of the Haar shifts, it is sufficient to get the estimates for the Haar\nshifts that grow sub-exponentially (for example, polynomially) in the complexity of the shifts and the estimates for the paraproducts (there is no\ncomplexity of the paraproducts).\nThe estimates for each operators will be in turn factored into two embedding theorems, and these embedding theorems are proved in this paper.\nThe embedding theorems and so the estimates of the Haar shifts and\nparaproducts hold in very general martingale settings,\n\n\f8\n\nF.

Consider a measure space X with \u03c3-finite measure \u03bc\nlet Lk = {Ijk }j , k \u2208 Z (or k \u2208 Z+ ) be partitions of X into disjoint sets Ijk ,\n0 < \u03bc(Ijk ) < \u221e.\nWe assume that the partition Lk+1 is a refinement of Lk .\nLet A be the \u03c3-algebra generated by all the partitions Lk . In what follows\nall functions on X we consider will be assumed to be A-measurable.\nWith respect to this \u03c3-algebras we can define martingale averaging operators Ek , and martingale difference operators \u2206nk := \u2212Ek + Ek+n .\nWe adapt the following notation.\nch I\nchk I\nhf iI ,\nEI\n\u2206I\n\u2206nI\n\nffl\n\nI\n\nf\n\nThe collection of children of I \u2208 L, i.e. if I \u2208 Ln then ch I =\n{J \u2208 Ln+1 : J \u2282 I}.\nThe collection of children of the order k of I \u2208 L; ch0 (I) = {I},\nchk+1 (I) = {ch(J) : J \u2208 chk (I)}.\n \u0301\nThe average of f over I, hf iI = \u03bc(I)\u22121 I f (x)d\u03bc(x);\nThe averaging\noperator, EI f := hf iI 1I ; note that\nP\nEk = I\u2208Lk EI .\nP\nMartingale difference operator, \u2206I := \u2212EI + J\u2208ch(I) EJ ; note\nP\nthat \u2206k = I\u2208Lk \u2206I .\nMartingale difference operator of order n,\nX\n\u2206nI := \u2212EI +\nEJ .\nJ\u2208chn (I)\n\nSince the measure \u03bc is assumed to be fixed we sometimes will be using\n|E| for \u03bc(E) and dx for d\u03bc(x). We also will be using L2 for L2 (\u03bc)\nThe prototypical example is X = R or Rd with L being a dyadic lattice\nD.\n2.2. Haar shifts.\nDefinition 2.1. A Haar shift S of complexity n is given by\nX\nSf =\nSI \u2206nI f,\nI\u2208D\n\nwhere the operators SI act on \u2206nI L2 and can be represented as integral\noperators with kernels aI , kaI k\u221e \u2264 |I|\u22121 . The latter means that for all\nf, g \u2208 \u2206nI L2\n\u02c6 \u02c6\naI (x, y)f (y)g(x)dxdy.\nhSI f, gi =\nI\n\nI\n\nThis is a slightly more general definition than the one in [10], but only\nthe estimate kaI k\u221e \u2264 |I|\u22121 is essential for our construction. Note also that\naccording to the definition in [10] the complexity of the corresponding shift\nis n \u2212 1, not n, which really does not matter; we just find our definition of\ncomplexity a bit more convenient.\n\n\fA BELLMAN FUNCTION PROOF OF THE L2 BUMP CONJECTURE\n\n9\n\nThe estimate kaI k\u221e \u2264 |I|\u22121 means that the operators SI are \"L1 \u00d7 L1\nnormalized\", meaning that\n(2.1)\n\n|hSI f, gi| \u2264 |I|\n\nkf k1 kgk1\n|I| |I|\n\n\u2200f, g \u2208 \u2206nI L2\n\nHaar shifts of complexity 1 are simply \"L1 \u00d7 L1 normalized\" martingale\ntransforms; martingale transform here means in particular that the subspaces \u2206I are orthogonal, and S can be represented as an orthogonal sum\nof the operators SI .\nA Haar shift of complexity n \u2265 2 is not generally a martingale transform,\nmeaning that the subspaces \u2206nI generally intersect, so S does not split into\ndirect sum of SI .\nHowever, if one goes with step n, then the corresponding operator is a\nmartingale transform, so a Haar shift of complexity n can be represented\nas a sum of n Haar shifts of complexity 1. Namely, for k = 1, 2, . . . , n \u2212 1\ndefine\nLk = {I : I \u2208 Lk+nj , j \u2208 Z},\nand let\nSk =\n\nX\n\nSI .\n\nI\u2208Lk\n\nPn\u22121\nThen S = k=0\nSk and each Sk is a Haar shift of complexity 1 with respect\nto the lattice Lk .\nRemark. Therefore, uniform estimate for the Haar shifts of complexity 1\n(i.e. for the \"L1 \u00d7 L1 normalized\" martingale transforms) gives the linear\nin complexity estimate for the general Haar shifts. Notice that the estimate\ndoes not depend on the number of children.\n2.3. Paraproducts.

Concluding remarks and open problems\n5.1. One sided bumps. The famous theorem of P. Koosis [11] states that\ngiven a weight u on the unit circle, one can find a non-zero weight v such\nthat the Hilbert transform T is bounded as an operator from L2 (u) to L2 (v)\nif and only if 1/u \u2208 L1 . The same result hods for the maximal function, see\n[23].\nSo it is possible to have a situation when one has two weight estimates,\nbut one cannot \"bump\" the L1 -norm of 1/u (w in our notation). This leads\nto a very natural in our opinion) question \"can one \"bump\" only one weight\nto get the two weight estimate?\" For example, can one find a reasonable\nYoung function \u03a6 that the condition\n\u0012\n\u02c6 \u0013\n\u22121\nsup |I|\nw kvk \u03a6 < \u221e\nI\n\nI\n\nL (I)\n\nimplies the boundedness inL2 of the operator Mv1/2 T Mw1/2 for all (bounded)\nCalder\u00f3n\u2013Zygmund operators T ?\nNote, that for maximal function a one sided bump condition (but with\nthe bump on the \"wrong\"\nside) is sufficient. Namely, it follows from the\n \u0301\u221e\n(\u03a6(x))\u22121 dx < \u221e and the weights v, w satisfy\nresult in [21] that if\n\u0012\n\u02c6 \u0013\n\u22121\nsup |I|\n(5.1)\nv kwk \u03a6 < \u221e ,\nI\n\nI\n\nL (I)\n\nthen the operator Mv1/2 MMw1/2 , where M is the Hardy\u2013Littlewood maximal operator, is bounded in L2 . It is natural to remark here that in [16]\nwe demonstrated this result of P\u00e9rez by almost precisely the same Bellman\nfunction that the reader saw above.\n\n\f22\n\nF. NAZAROV, A. REZNIKOV, S. TREIL, AND A. VOLBERG\n\n5.2. Estimates for general measures. A standard way to set up the two\nweight estimate problem for integral operators is to make the change of\nvariables so in the integral operator one integrates with respect to the same\nmeasure that is used to compute the norm in the domain.\nNamely, if one defines measures \u03bc, \u03bd, d\u03bc = wdx, d\u03bd = vdx, then the Lp\nboundedness of the operator Mv1/p T Mw1/p\u2032 is equivalent (at least formally)\nto the boundedness of the operator T\u03bc : Lp (\u03bc) \u2192 Lp (\u03bd), where\n\u02c6\nT\u03bc f (x) = K(x, y)f (y)d\u03bc(y);\nK here is the kernel of the Calder\u00f3n\u2013Zygmund operator T .\nIn fact, everything can be interpreted absolutely rigorously. The boundedness of such operators can be interpreted as uniform boundedness of the\nsmooth truncations; in fact such uniform boundedness is equivalent to the\nboundedness of the bilinear form on functions with separated compact supports, i.e. to the weakest possible notion of boundedness, see [14].\nThis setting gives the most general form of the two weight problem, since\n\u03bc and \u03bd can be general measures, not necessarily absolutely continuous,\nthey even can be purely singular. So the question arises, \"how one can\nbump general measures?\" The approach with Orlicz spaces, or any other\nfunction spaces works only for absolutely continuous measures.\nReferences\n[1] D.
