Despite major advances in the observational and theoretical\ntools, the solution remains elusive (see e.g., Klimchuk 2006). Active regions provide a target\nof opportunity to study the dominant heating mechanisms for the corona. The basic building\nblocks of active regions are coronal loops. Because of the lack of cross-field transport of mass\nand thermal energy in the corona, the problem of coronal heating can effectively be reduced\nto a clear understanding of the heating mechanism in a single isolated coronal loop or loop\nstrand.\nThe large-scale 1 MK loops and fan-like loops (which appear at the periphery of active regions) are seen clearly in observations recorded using the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE; Handy et al. 1999) 171 \u00c5 passband. Their properties appear to be consistent with impulsive heating models (see e.g., Tripathi et al. 2009; Warren, Winebarger, and Mariska\n2003; Klimchuk 2006, 2009, and references cited therein). However, the 3\u20135 MK loops in the\ncore of the active regions are more diffuse and more difficult to isolate even with present day\nobservatories. Hence it is more difficult to measure the physical plasma parameters along\nthese hot core loops and to compare those properties with simulated results (although see\nL\u00f3pez Fuentes and Klimchuk 2010). The \"moss\" regions are located at footpoints of hot\n(3\u20135 MK) loops (Martens et al. 2000; Antiochos et al. 2003; Tripathi et al. 2010) and they\nmap the photospheric magnetic flux very closely (Tripathi et al. 2008). The moss regions,\nbeing the footpoints of the hot loops, provide a unique opportunity to study the dominant\nheating mechanism at work in active region core loops.\nA number of publications involving observational results, analytical and 1D numerical\nsimulations have proposed that steady heating is at play in the hot loops associated with\nmoss regions. The main argument is that minimal variability is observed in brightness of the\nmoss emission or in the Doppler shifts and line widths of spectral lines. Antiochos et al.\n(2003) pointed out that impulsive heating would produce transient loops in the cores of\nactive regions that would be seen by TRACE as the plasma cools through 1 MK. Such\nloops are present but not ubiquitous. The authors also noted that the brightness of moss is\nquite steady when averaged over several TRACE pixels. Brooks and Warren (2009) later\nshowed that Doppler shifts and line widths observed by the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging\nSpectrometer (EIS) on Hinode are also quite steady. Finally, Tripathi et al. (2010) measured\nthe density and thermal properties of moss observed by EIS and found that they do not\nchange significantly over periods ranging from an hour to 5 days.\nThese observations provide compelling evidence that heating in the cores of active regions must be quasi-steady if the cross-field scale of the heating is comparable to the 2 arcsec\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n(1.5 Mm) resolution of EIS or larger. That is, we can conclude that the heating is steady, but\nonly if the plasma does not have unresolved sub-structure. There is good reason to believe\nthat such sub-structure may exist, however (e.g., Klimchuk 2006). Individual thin strands\ncould be highly time variable, and yet an unresolved bundle would appear steady as long as\nthe strands are not in phase. This is true for both the coronal portions of the strands and\ntheir moss footpoints.\nWe therefore seek a diagnostic of heating that does not require that the fundamental structures be resolved. Doppler shifts are one possibility. Steady heating tends to\nproduce no Doppler shift because the loop evolves to a static equilibrium (although see\nMariska and Boris 1983; Klimchuk et al. 2010). Impulsive heating would produce a net\nred shift on the other hand. In an unresolved bundle of strands, some strands would have\nupflows due to evaporation and others would have downflows due to condensation (cooling\nand draining). Simulations show that the upflows are faster, fainter, and shorter lived than\nthe downflows (Patsourakos and Klimchuk 2006). Hence, the composite line profile would\nbe red shifted by several kilometers per second, and very hot lines would also have a faint\nblue wing enhancement. The red shifts are predicted to decrease with temperature and\nmay even become blue shifts in the hottest lines (Bradshaw and Klimchuk 2010, in preparation). The observational picture concerning Doppler shifts in moss regions is unclear.\nSome published measurements indicate minimal red-shifts consistent with steady heating\n(e.g., Brooks and Warren 2009), while other measurements indicate larger red-shifts consistent with impulsive heating (e.g., Doschek et al. 1976; Brueckner 1981; Klimchuk 1987;\nDoschek et al. 2008; Del Zanna 2008). This is an important area of future work.\nAnother diagnostic of coronal heating that works when there is unresolved sub-structure\nis the emission measure distribution, EM(T ), or the closely related differential emission measure distribution, DEM(T ). Since the plasma is roughly isothermal along the coronal portion\nof a strand, EM(T ) in the corona is determined primarily by the distribution of strand temperatures. An isothermal corona with all strands having the same temperature implies steady\nheating (Warren 1999; Landi et al. 2002), but some coronal EM(T ) support a nanoflare\ninterpretation (e.g., Patsourakos and Klimchuk 2009; O'Dwyer et al. 2010; Reale et al.\n2009). Warren et al. (2010) suggested that the lack of a strong correlation between hot and\nwarm emission in the core of an active region is evidence that the heating must be steady.\nWe disagree that this is the only interpretation. The relative intensities of coronal emission\nformed at, say, log T = 6.0 and 6.5 can vary greatly depending on the magnitude of the\nnanoflares (e.g., Klimchuk et al. 2008, Figs. 4 and 7, dashed curves).\nMoss is the transition region footpoints of hot strands, and the EM(T ) there is determined largely by the variation of temperature along the strands. Klimchuk et al. (2008) have\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nshown that the form of EM(T ) is different under three limiting conditions: static equilibrium,\nstrong condensation and strong evaporation. We make use of these differences in the work\nreported here. We measure the EM distribution of two moss regions observed by EIS and\ncompare them to the theoretical predictions. In this way we distinguish between steady and\nimpulsive heating.\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows. In section 2 we present our observations.\nIn section 3 we provide the emission measure expressions following Klimchuk et al. (2008).\nSection 4 provides results and we summarise and discuss our results in section 5.\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nIn this study, we have analysed observations recorded by the EIS aboard Hinode. The\nEIS instrument observes the spectral ranges 170\u2013210 and 250\u2013290 \u00c5, providing observations\nin a broad range of temperatures (log T [K] = 4.7\u20137.3). For detailed information on EIS see\nCulhane et al. (2007). For most of the EIS studies only a limited number of spectral lines\nwere chosen due to the limitations on telemetry. However, occasionally full spectral scans of\nspecific regions have been telemetered. Here we use one such raster of an active region AR\n10961 recorded on July 01, 2007 at 03:18 UT. The active region first appeared on the east\nlimb on June 26th, 2007. The data analysed were obtained from a single raster that scanned\na field of view (FOV) of 128\u2032\u2032 by 128\u2032\u2032 with the 1\u2032\u2032 slit, moving from west to east with an\nexposure time of 25 sec. The over-plotted box on the TRACE 171 \u00c5 image displayed in the\nleft panel of Fig. 1 marks the region which was rastered by EIS. An EIS image obtained in\nFe XII \u03bb195.12 \u00c5 is shown in the right panel of Fig. 1.\nThe full spectral scan allowed us to choose spectral lines formed over a broad range of\ntemperature, which is essential in order to obtain a good EM distribution of the plasma.\nThis is the first time a full spectral scan is being used to derive an EM distribution in active\nregion moss. In our study we have used relatively clean spectral lines (see Table 1) with temperatures of formation log T [K] = 5.1\u20136.5 based on EIS spectral atlases (Landi and Young\n2009; Young and Landi 2009). The standard EIS software provided in SolarSoft were used\nto process the data and eis auto fit, also provided in SolarSoft, was used for Gaussian fitting\nthe spectral lines. To de-blend some of the blended lines labelled 'b' in Table 1 we have used\nthe same procedure as in Tripathi et al. (2010) based on the suggestions of Young et al.\n(2007, 2009).\nWe have derived EM following the approach of Pottasch (1963) whereby individual\nemission lines yield estimates of the emission measure at the lines' temperatures of formation.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n\nTable 1: Spectral lines used to study the emission measure distribution in moss regions.\nIon\nWavelength log T\n[\u00c5]\n[K]\nO IV\n279.6\n5.15\nO IV\n279.9\n5.15\nOV\n248.5\n5.35\nO VI\n183.9\n5.45\nO VI\n184.1\n5.45\nMg V\n276.6\n5.45\nSi VI\n246.0\n5.60\nFe VIII\n185.2\n5.60\nMg VI\n269.0\n5.65\nb\nMg VII\n278.4\n5.80\nSi VII\n275.3\n5.80\nFe IX\n171.1\n5.85\nFe X\n184.5\n6.05\nSi IX\n258.1\n6.05\nSi X\n261.0\n6.15\nFe XI\n180.4\n6.15\nFe XI\n188.3\n6.15\nFe XII\n192.4\n6.20\nFe XII\n193.5\n6.20\nb\nFe XII\n195.1\n6.20\nFe XIII\n202.0\n6.25\nb\nFe XIV\n274.2\n6.30\nFe XV\n284.2\n6.35\nFe XVI\n263.0\n6.45\nCa XIV\n193.8\n6.55\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nAn EM distribution is built up by considering lines formed over a wide range of temperatures.\nThe method requires the contribution function to be approximated by a function such that\nit is defined to be a constant over the temperature range log Tmax \u2212 0.15 to log Tmax + 0.15\nwhere Tmax is the temperature where the contribution function has its maximum. A detailed\ndescription of this method is given in Tripathi et al. (2010).\n\n3.\n\nTheoretical Transition Region Emission Measure\n\nKlimchuk et al. (2008) derived the differential emission measure (DEM) distribution of\nthe transition region of a strand in the limiting cases of strong evaporation (Equation A3),\nstrong condensation (Equation A7), and static equilibrium (Equation A12). The transition\nregion is taken here to be the region of steep gradient at the strand footpoints. Its temperature ranges from a chromospheric value up to approximately one-half of the maximum\ntemperature in the strand. Thus, it can reach several MK for strands which are very hot.\nIn the case of static equilibrium, a downward heat flux from the corona powers the radiative\nlosses from the transition region. These losses are ignorable in the case of strong evaporation,\nwhere a downward heat flux drives an evaporative upflow. The energy flux of the upflow is\ndominated by enthalpy if the flow is subsonic. For the final case of strong condensation, the\nenthalpy of a downflow powers the transition region radiation, with the heat flux being relatively unimportant. See Bradshaw (2008) and Bradshaw and Cargill (2010a,b) for detailed\ndiscussions of the importance of downflows in heating the transition region and cooling the\ncorona.\nThe expressions given in Klimchuk et al. (2008) are for the differential emission measure.\nThe conversion to emission measure (EM) requires that they be multiplied by temperature\nand by ln(10), giving\n\nEMse \u2248 ln(10)\n\n\u0010 \u03ba \u00111/2 P\u0304 T 3/4\n0\n... static equilibrium\n14\nk \u039b(T )1/2\n\nEMcon \u2248 \u2212 ln(10)\n\nEMev \u2248\n\n5 k J0 T\n... strong condensation\n\u039b(T )\n\nln(10) \u03ba0 P\u0304 2 T 1/2\n... strong evaporation\n20 k 3\nJ0\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03ba0 =1.0\u00d710\u22126 in cgs units, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature. J0 is mass\nflux defined as J0 = nv, where n and v are electron number density and plasma flow speed\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nrespectively. P\u0304 is average pressure along a strand. \u039b(T ) is the optically thin radiative\nloss function. Fig. 2 displays the radiative losses as a function of temperature calculated\nwith CHIANTI (Dere et al. 1997) by free-free, radiative recombination and by line radiation for photospheric abundances (dashed-dotted line) of Grevesse and Sauval (1998) and\ncoronal abundances (solid line) of Feldman (1992). For this calculation, we have used the\nCHIANTI v6.0.1 ionization equilibrium (Dere et al. 2009). The above equations give the\nemission measure curves for individual loop strands. While computing the theoretical EMs\nto compare with the observed EMs, we have considered the average pressure (P\u0304 ) and mass\nflux J0 as arbitrary constants. We have restricted ourselves to the temperature dependence\nof EMev , EMcon and EMse and compared the shapes of the theoretical EM curves with those\nderived observationally as explained in section 2. The assumption of constant pressure and\nconstant mass flux in a given strand is justified so long as the different parts of the solar\natmosphere are connected along the magnetic field. However, this assumption would break\ndown if plasma in different layers of the atmosphere were physically in different structures\nas was suggested by e.g., Landi and Feldman (2008) and references therein.\n\n4.\n\nResults\n\nFigure 3 displays EM curves for two different moss regions labelled \"A\" and \"B\" in\nthe right panel of Fig. 1. The EM curves are created using the photospheric abundances\n(top panel) of Grevesse and Sauval (1998) and the coronal abundances (bottom panel) of\nFeldman (1992). The error bars on the EMs are computed by considering a 30% error in\nthe observed intensities for all the spectral lines, which is a rough estimate of the cumulative\nerrors due to radiometric calibration, line fitting and atomic calculations.\nThe EM curves for the two different regions displayed in Fig. 3 are very similar to each\nother when the same abundances are used. However, for a given region the EM curves\nare significantly different for the two different abundances, mainly at lower temperatures.\nThe difference in the trend of the EM curves is basically due to the three data points\non the extreme left, corresponding to three Oxygen lines namely O IV, O V and O VI.\nThe EMs for Oxygen lines do not appear to be consistent with the EMs for other lines\nwhen coronal abundances are used. However, this discrepancy disappears when we use\nphotospheric abundances. From the figure we note that the EMs of the Oxygen lines do\nnot change when coronal or photospheric abundances are used. However, for other lines, the\nEMs increased by a factor of four for photospheric abundances, which makes the EMs for\nother lines consistent with the EMs for the Oxygen lines. Therefore, it seems appropriate to\nconclude that the composition in these moss regions is photospheric. However, we note that\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nOxygen is the only element in our dataset with a high first ionization potential (FIP). The\nhigh-FIP O VI lines agree with the low-FIP Mg V line at log T = 5.4 only with photospheric\nabundances. To verify the conclusion that moss regions must have photospheric abundances,\nit is important to examine additional pairs of high-FIP and low-FIP lines formed at the same\ntemperature.\nThe observational picture of abundances in the solar upper atmosphere is not well established (see Feldman and Widing 2003, for a recent review). Using observations recorded by\nSkylab SO82A, it was found that in newly emerging active regions the composition was nearly\nphotospheric. However, within a few hours after their emergence the composition starts to\nmodify and it approaches a typical coronal composition (see Sheeley 1995; Widing 1997;\nWiding and Feldman 2001). Using data from the Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer (CDS)\naboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO), Young and Mason (1997) found\nphotospheric composition in an emerging flux region. The active region studied here had\nemerged about 6 days prior to the date when the data analysed here were recorded. Considering the results obtained using the Skylab observations, our analysis should suggest coronal\nabundances. It is worth mentioning, however, that Skylab SO82A was a slitless spectrometer which produced overlapping spectroheliorams providing partial information for active\nregions. Del Zanna (2003) suggested that the previous results based on Skylab observations\noverestimated the FIP bias by a large factor for active regions, if the plasma is isothermal\nrather than multi-thermal. Furthermore, since the moss regions are presumably confined to\na relatively low altitude in the solar atmosphere, the FIP effect might not be significant in\nthese regions. Therefore, photospheric abundances could prevail in moss regions.\nThe EM curves for the moss regions show that the peak of the emission comes from\nFe XIII (log T = 6.25) as suggested by Tripathi et al. (2010). In addition, the EM(T ) obtained using photospheric abundances shows a monotonic increase at lower temperatures\nfrom log T = 5.15. However, the EM(T ) obtained using coronal abundances shows a minimum in the emission measure at \u223c log T = 5.5 similar to the EM curve obtained using the DEM distribution derived from SERTS EUV spectrum using the same abundances\n(Brosius et al. 1996, 2000).\nWe have compared the observed EM distributions obtained using coronal and photospheric abundances with those predicted theoretically for the three limiting cases of static\nequilibrium (EMse , Eq. 1), strong condensation (EMcon , Eq. 2) and strong evaporation (EMev ,\nEq. 3) for both the regions 'A' and 'B' marked in the right panel of Fig. 1. Fig. 4 displays\nthe observational EMs obtained using photospheric abundances over-plotted with the theoretical EMs for the three limiting cases, both for region 'A' and region 'B' in the left and\nright columns respectively.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nThe theoretical curve that provides the best overall match with the observed points is\nEMcon i.e., the strong condensation case (see plots in the middle row in Fig. 4). The EMse\nfor static equilibrium matches quite well with observed EM for temperatures below 1 MK\nbut not at higher temperatures. However, that for strong condensation (EMcon ) matches\nquite well for log T = 5.2 \u2013 6.25. Above log T = 6.3, the EMcon suggests an increasing\ntrend, whereas the observational EM starts to decrease. We can understand this apparent\ndiscrepancy as follows.\nSuppose that unresolved strands are heating impulsively to very high temperatures by\nnanoflares and subsequently cooling. As stated earlier, the transition region in a given strand\nextends to roughly one-half of the maximum strand temperature. Recently heated strands\nwill therefore contribute to moss emission over a wide range of temperatures, while strands\nthat have cooled will only contribute emission at lower temperatures. We can imagine a\ncollection of curves like those in the middle panels of Fig. 4 except truncated at different\ntemperatures above log T = 6.3. The sum of those curves would have a shape similar to\nthe observed EM(T ), rolling over at log T = 6.3. This basic effect can be seen in the\ntransition region of model 4 in Klimchuk et al. (2008, Fig. 7, dot-dashed curve). The figure\nshows DEM(T ) (= EM(T )/T ) and is therefore flat rather than positively sloped at the lower\ntemperatures. The temperature where EM(T ) is expected to roll over will depend upon the\nnumber distribution and brightness of strands in different stages of cooling. Strands which\nhave cooled below 1 MK should be relatively faint due to mass draining and therefore will\nhave a reduced contribution to the composite EM(T ).\nThe EMev curve for strong evaporation does not show any resemblance to the observed\nEM curve. This is not surprising, since, in the nanoflare scenario, evaporative upflows\nare much fainter and much shorter lived than the subsequent condensation downflows and\ntherefore contribute minimally to the net emission.\nWhen using coronal abundances, we did not find a reasonable correspondence between\nthe observed EM(T ) and any of the theoretical EM(T ). However, this conclusion is based on\nthe disagreement in the emission measure at log T < 5.45, and therefore depends entirely on\nEM of Oxygen lines. The EMcon and EMse curves fit the data equally well in this questionable\nrange log T < 5.45. However, we note that at log T > 5.45 EMcon provides a better fit to\nthe data than EMse regardless of which abundance set is assumed.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n5.\n\nSummary and discussion\n\nWe have obtained EM distributions in active region moss using full spectral scans\nrecorded with EIS for two different regions. The EM distributions for the two regions\nshow very good agreement with each other. The EM obtained using coronal abundances\ndoes not give consistent values for different lines. However, photospheric abundances seem\nto provide consistent EMs. The EM distributions show a monotonically increasing trend\nfrom log T = 5.15 \u2013 6.3. Of the three theoretical limiting cases we have considered, strong\ncondensation (EMcon ) best reproduces the observations. Static equilibrium (EMcon ) does a\ngood job at lower temperatures, but it fails significantly above log T = 6.0. Strong evaporation (EMcon ) is clearly inconsistent with the observations. We conclude from this that\ndownflows play an important role in powering the moss radiation. A similar conclusion was\nreached by Bradshaw (2008) on the basis of observed red-shifts (see e.g., Doschek et al. 1976;\nBrueckner 1981; Klimchuk 1987; Doschek et al. 2008; Del Zanna 2008; Warren et al.\n2008; Tripathi et al. 2009).\nAs we have discussed, one obvious source of downflows is the cooling and draining of\nplasma that has been impulsively heated by nanoflares. As long as the heated strands have\na sub-resolution diameter, this picture is consistent with observations of apparently steady\nintensities, Doppler shifts, and line widths. Another possible source of downflows is material\nfrom Type II spicules. This newly discovered phenomena appears to represent jets of chromospheric plasma that is heated to coronal temperatures as it is ejected (De Pontieu et al.\n2007). Presumably the material subsequently cools and falls. Much more observational and\nmodeling work is necessary before any firm conclusions can be drawn.\nAlthough our results support the picture of nanoflares and possibly Type II spicules in\nthe cores of active regions, we cannot rule out steady heating entirely. If magnetic flux strands\nconstrict appreciably at their base, then EMse (T ) will have a different shape from that which\nwe have shown (e.g. Warren et al. 2010). The theoretical curve could in principle be brought\nin line with observations. However, because the transition region is so thin, the constriction\nmust be very dramatic and the transition region must fall right where the constriction occurs.\nThis would seem rather surprising given that the height of the transition region depends on\nthe coronal pressure and moves up and down in response to changes in the heating rate, either\nslow or rapid. It has been found that the area of quiet Sun network boundaries increases\nby a factor of about 1.6 between log T = 5.4 and 6.0 (Patsourakos et al. 1999). How this\nrelates to moss regions discussed here is unclear.\nThe result that photospheric abundances apply in regions of downflow may hold important clues about the origin of the FIP effect, the fractionation of elements based on their\nfirst ionization potential. If fractionation (coronal abundances) occurs in regions of steady\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nheating, where conditions are static, but not in regions of impulsive heating, where there are\ncontinual upflows and downflows, then it is suggested that the fractionation process involves\nsome sort of long-term settling. Further observational and modeling work is needed also in\nthis regard.\nWe thank an anonymous referee for carefully reading the manuscript and comments.\nDT and HEM acknowledge from STFC.
