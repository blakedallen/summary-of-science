In applications of wave plates in which\nlow price and rapid availability are more important than\nhigh quality, the construction of wave plates from inexpensive materials can be of great practical interest. For\nexample, ordinary cellophane used in commercial packaging can be very close to a half-wave thickness for visible light, as mentioned by Richard Feynman in his famous lectures [4], and wave plates can be constructed\nfrom this material. Recently, construction of a quarterwave retarder for light at \u03bb = 632.8 nm from the 3M\nPP2500T M polyester film was proposed [5, 6] and some\nproperties of this film were investigated. While this film\nis inexpensive, it is not commonly found in a laboratory.\nIn this paper we explore the possibility of using most\n\n300\n280\n260\n\nlt\nTi\n\nax\n\nna\n\naq\nt/n\ny\n\nt/n\nDb\n\nz\ny\n\nDa\nnb\n\nk\n\nnz\n\nz\n\nny\n\nFIG. 2: On the left: Definition of the coordinate system\nof a transparency waveplate.

Apart from general interest in a broad class of\napplications, this project is also motivated by the need\nfor cheap wave plates for building commercial and experimental optical atomic magnetometers based on optical\npumping with circularly polarized light and detection of\nspins using light polarization measurements [7]. In magnetometer applications, large-size waveplates are often\nneeded, while the price grows linearly with the wave-plate\narea as illustrated in Fig.1.\nOverhead transparencies are made of polymer film\nproduced by a process in which the film is extruded\nthrough a slit onto a chilled polished turning roll where\nit is quenched from one side. Additional film stretching can be employed for achieving desirable properties.\nSuch stretching may produce biaxial materials, such as\nbiaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate (boPET)\nfilm from which some overhead transparencies are made\n\n\f2\n\n30\n\nEllipticity, degrees\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n-20\n\n-30\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\nRotation, degrees\n\nFIG. 3: Ellipticity as a function of transparency rotation.\nThe data shown with squares agree well with a fit using Eq.\n(3) (the solid line), in which \u03b4 = 0.91 rad and an arbitrary offset in the rotation angle is allowed.

Transparency has its edges aligned with the\nscreen. The color segments are generated in the computer by\ndrawing filled rectangles in a drawing program. Three \"pure\"\ncolor quadrants provide information on uniformity at different\nwavelengths.

This behavior is similar for different\ntransparencies.\n\nfor copiers or laser printers. Refractive indices of boPET\nwere studied in Ref. [8]. The extrusion and stretching processes in general lead to biaxial birefringence;\nhowever, it is possible that one preferential direction of\nmolecular orientation is defined and one refractive index\nis more pronounced than the others and the medium can\nbe approximated as uniaxial. For example, in Ref.[9], the\nstructural properties of HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) film have been studied and it was found that draw\nratio affected crystalline orientation and refractive indices approximately in the same way in two directions\nbut quite differently in the third direction. Birefringence\nis a very general property of transparent polymers, including overhead transparencies.

Optical properties are of great practical interest because they can be\nused to analyze the material structure and to control the\nextrusion process.\nII.\n\nPOLARIZATION PROPERTIES OF\nOVERHEAD TRANSPARENCIES\n\nWe investigate polarization properties of overhead\ntransparencies with a commercial polarimeter, Thorlabs\nPAX5710IR1-T, which outputs the state of polarization\nin the form of a polarization ellipse with numerical values of the ellipticity \u03c7 and the azimuth \u03c8 as well as\nthe Poincar\u00e9 sphere with coordinates that are the three\nStokes parameters s1 , s2 , and s3 . The Stokes parameters\ncan be found from the ellipticity and azimuth, or from\nthe set of Jones vector parameters such as field amplitudes ax and ay and phase shift \u03b4, or vice versa [11]. For\nexample, the ellipticity and azimuth are related to the\nJones vector parameters through the following equations\n1\n2ax ay sin \u03b4\narcsin 2\n,\n2\nax + a2y\n\n(1)\n\n1\ns2\n2ax ay cos \u03b4\n1\n= arctan\narctan\n.\n2\ns1\n2\na2x \u2212 a2y\n\n(2)\n\n\u03c7=\n\n\u03c8=\n\nIt is convenient to parameterize normalized field amplitudes as ax = cos \u03b8 and ay = sin \u03b8, so ellipticity and\n\nEquation 3 will be used throughout the paper to relate\nthe polarimeter's output to a more fundamental property\nof optical material such as retardation and to fit experimental data in which \u03b8 or \u03b4 are varied.\nFirst, to verify that transparency can operate as a wave\nplate, we study the dependence of ellipticity on the transparency rotation angle. The experimental arrangement\nfor this measurement is simple: a helium-neon laser beam\n(632.8 nm wavelength), linearly polarized with a Polaroid\nfilm, is sent to the detection head of the polarimeter\nthrough a fragment of transparency attached to a rotation mount with angular resolution of 1 degree. The rotation is defined in Fig.2, left panel. From this definition\nif transparency behaves as a waveplate the ellipticity of\nthe transmitted light as a function of the transparency\nrotation must satisfy Eq. (3) in which \u03b8 is the transparency rotation angle. The ellipticity of the light as a\nfunction of this angle is shown in Fig.3. The behavior is\nperiodic as expected for a wave plate, in accordance with\nEq. (3), but some deviation from periodicity is observed\nwhich can be explained by the shift of the point where\nthe laser beam intersects the transparency when it is not\nexactly in the center of rotation combined with spatial\nvariations in the retardation that will be discussed later.\nThe retardation \u03b4 is about 0.91 rad and because in the\nTaylor expansion of arcsine the first term is much larger\nthan the others, we obtain that the dependence on the\ntransparency rotation angle is dominantly a sine wave as\nis seen in Fig.3. The maximum value of ellipticity in this\nparticular measurement is less than maximum possible\n45 degrees of a \u03bb/4 plate. For constructing a \u03bb/4 plate\na more appropriate part of the transparency has to be\nchosen or the plane of the transparency has to be tilted.\nThe next graph, Fig.4 demonstrates how the position\nof the transparency for a fixed orientation affects the\ninduced ellipticity and hence retardation. Apart from\ndemonstrating how the retardation can be optimized by\nspatial selection, this graph also gives information about\ntypical retardation spatial non-uniformity in one dimension which is important for the determination of the useful size of the transparency wave plate. From the data,\nwe see that the size is of order 1 cm. By using a computer\nscreen and a crossed polaroid film it is possible to find\nregions with larger area of uniformity as demonstrated in\nFig.5.\nTo understand the order of the transparency waveplate\nand to estimate the useful wavelength range where the\ntransparency can function as a waveplate of a given type,\nwe measured the wavelength dependence of the ellipticity of a transparency using a tunable Ti:Sapphire laser as\n\n\f4\nlight source (Fig.7). For a particular angle \u03b8 = 45\u25e6 , chosen in the experiment to give maximum ellipticity, Eq.\n(3) predicts the dependence of ellipticity on retardation\nas a triangle wave with an amplitude 45\u25e6 . Because the\nretardation changes approximately linearly with wavelength in some range\n\n0.13\n0.12\n0.11\n0.10\n\nnx-n y\n\nthe ellipticity follows a quasi-periodic triangle wave as a\nfunction of wavelength as observed experimentally. The\ndistance between zeros can be used to obtain total retardation.\nIt is necessary in general to have the dependence of refractive index on wavelength to obtain total retardation.\nSuch dependence is often approximated with the Cauchy\ndispersion formula n(\u03bb) = n0 + n1 /\u03bb2 + n2 /\u03bb4 + ... which\nis accurate when wavelength of the light is far from resonances. For wavelengths shown in the Fig.7 the constancy of refractive index is a good approximation. In a\nlarger range, from 300 nm to 900 nm, this assumption\nis not satisfied since a strong absorption band is located\nnear 300 nm. We used a Varian CARY219 spectrometer to investigate the refractive index variation in the\nrange 400-800 nm. A transparency film was inserted between two crossed polaroid films with its x axis at 45\u25e6 ,\nso the transmission depended on the retardation. The\nwavelength of minima (or maxima) of the transmitted\nintensity could be used to calculate the refractive index\ndifference nx \u2212 ny as a function of wavelength. The results are plotted in Fig.8. Below 600 nm the wavelength\ndependence of refractive indices becomes significant, and\na good fit requires retaining 1/\u03bb2 and 1/\u03bb4 terms as it is\nshown in Fig.8.\nIt is interesting to note that a transparency between\ntwo polarizers can serve as a birefringent filter. Investigation of such filters based on low-cost polymers has\nbeen carried out in Ref.[12] where filters with bandwidth\n50 nm were demonstrated.\nIt might be convenient to adjust the retardation to a\ndesirable level by tilting a transparency waveplate. The\ndependence on the tilt is determined by two factors: one\nis the increase in the optical path, and the other is the\nchange in the retardation per unit length. In the general case of a biaxial medium the dependence of retardation and ellipticity on the tilt angle is quite complicated\nand for the analysis it is important to find the principal\naxes of the index ellipsoid, see Fig.2. To first approximation one in-plane principal axis, x or y, with the assumption to be justified in a moment that z is normal\nto the transparency, can be found easily by determining\ntilt direction for which the change in retardation for a\nsmall tilt angle (\u00b13\u25e6 ) is the largest. From the dependence of retardation on the tilt angle (Eq.6) for this tilt\ndirection we estimated that nz \u2212 nx was about 0.2, much\nlarger than nx \u2212 ny \u2248 0.06 obtained from the wavelength\nmeasurements at normal incidence (Fig.8) for the transparency of this type.

Solid line is the fit based on Eqs.\n(3) and (6).\n\nincidence means that the z axis of the index ellipsoid has\na relatively small projection in the transparency plane\nand hence our zero-approximation assignment of refractive index subscripts is justified. After finding the z axis\napproximately, we can determine the principal refractive\nindices more accurately by investigating the retardation\nfor small deviations of the transparency film normal from\nthe z direction. If na and nb are defined as the semiaxes of the ellipse obtained by the intersection of the\nplane normal to the k vector with the index ellipsoid\n(Refs.[11, 13]), the retardation is proportional to na \u2212 nb .\nFor tilt of the ellipsoid around the x axis (Ref.[11], section\n14.3.3),\nna \u2212 nb = nx \u2212 ny \u2212 (nz \u2212 ny ) sin(tx /n)2\n\n(6)\n\n(t is the tilt angle, n is the average refractive index), and\nthe retardation decreases with tilt if nx < ny < nz while\nfor the tilt around the y axis,\nna \u2212 nb = nx \u2212 ny + (nz \u2212 nx ) sin(ty /n)2\n\n(7)\n\nthe retardation increases with tilt. For small tilt, in the\nfirst case the dependence is a downward parabola symmetric with respect to zero tilt; in the second case the\ndependence is an upward parabola. Generally, the dependence of retardation on the tilt has a saddle point\nwith orthogonal symmetry axes. If two dimensional data\nare given, the direction of the principal axis z can be\nfound as normal to the surface going through the saddle\npoint, and that of x and y axes can be found as the lines\nof symmetry. In Fig.9, for example, the x axis constitutes about 21\u25e6 angle with horizontal axis. If this angle\n\nis known, then from the fitting for tilt is sufficient to obtain nz \u2212 ny or nz \u2212 nx . If we neglect small effect due to\npath elongation, then nz \u2212 nx \u2243 0.23, close to our initial\nestimate.\nDifferent transparencies have slightly different properties, although qualitatively they are similar, including the\norientation of the index ellipsoid. In Fig.9 we show tilt\nmeasurements for a 3M black and white transparency. To\ngive an idea of variations, in Fig.10 we also present tilt\nmeasurements for the color transparency, with direction\nof the tilt around the x axis. This graph also illustrates\nthe behavior of ellipticity in a larger tilt range and shows\nthat 45\u25e6 ellipticity can be achieved by tilting at a relatively small angle of 7\u25e6 . The dependence in Fig.10 is quite\nsymmetric in accordance to the previously drawn conclusion that the z axis is orthogonal to the plane as depicted\nin Fig.2 on the left panel. We found using crossed polarizers that the x axis makes a constant angle about 20\u25e6\nwith respect to the edges of the transparency sheet across\na large transparency area, although it varies for different\nsamples. Using parabolic fits, we obtain nz \u2212 ny \u2243 0.18,\nagain much larger than nx \u2212ny = 0.06 in accordance with\nthe z axis perpendicular alignment to the transparency\nplane. We have qualitatively investigated the dependence\nof ellipticity of this transparency on the tilt angle for different tilt direction, around x, y, and the xy bisector.\nThe results are consistent with theoretical predictions:\nfor the tilt around x - the dependence is a downward\nparabola, around y - upward, and for the tilt around xy\nthe dependence is very slow (see Fig.9).\nTo complete the analysis it was also necessary to know\nthe average refractive indices. We have measured them\nusing Snell's law by sending a 633-nm light beam at the\nedges of a stack of transparencies and by tracing incident and refracted rays. Several measurements for different incidence angles resulted in the average value n =\n1.54 \u00b1 0.05. For comparison similar values at the same\nwavelength are obtained in Ref.[8] for biaxially-stretched\npoly-ethyleneterephthalate (PET) films, n = 1.59, and\nin Ref.[14] for polyester biaxial stretched films, n = 1.66,\nwhile measurements in Ref.[6] for 3M PP2500 films gave\ndifferent result, n \u2248 1.83. Such a high refractive index is\nuncommon for transparent organic materials which consist mostly of carbon and hydrogen, with single molecular\nbonds, and have similar densities. In order to check this\nresult we conducted our own measurements using beam\ntrace method as above for 3M PP2500 film. We found\nthat for the polarization perpendicular to the plane of\nthe sheet, n = 1.43 \u2212 1.58 (the spread is due to both\ninaccuracy and birefringence) and for the polarization in\nthe plane of the sheet n = 1.34 \u2212 1.65 with error of measurements about 0.05, in disagreement with Ref.[6].\nIt is also interesting to compare the results for the\ndifferences ni \u2212 nj . Our results for two different transparency types are nz \u2212 nx \u2248 0.2 and nx \u2212 ny \u2248 0.05. In\nRef.[8] for similar definition of principal axes, nx \u2212 nz \u2248\n0.15 and ny \u2212 nx \u2248 0.011, roughly in agreement. By\ninterpreting results of Ref.[6], the differences are of sim-\n\n\f6\nilar order. In general, birefringence depends strongly on\nthe details of manufacturing process, so only qualitative\nagreement is expected.\n\n120\n110\n\nIII.\n\nAPPLICATIONS\n\nThe simplest method to construct a desired wave plate\nfor a given wavelength is to use a light source of this\nwavelength and to choose an appropriate area in a transparency sheet, monitoring retardation with either a commercial polarimeter or some other optical polarimetric arrangement. On the other hand, tuning can be achieved\nby tilting. Wavelengths for which transparency retarders\ncan be constructed are in the wide range from visible\nto infrared. In particular, we tested operation at 633\nnm with a helium-neon laser, at 790-930 nm with a\nTi:Sapphire laser, and in the range of 300-900 nm with a\nspectrometer, as well as using a computer monitor with\npure color settings.\nIn addition, we have also investigated the possibility\nof superposition of two transparency sheets for achieving\ndesirable retardation. Since the eigenvectors of the Jones\nmatrix of a combination of two waveplates are in general complex, the system has elliptical-polarization eigenstates and is not equivalent to a single waveplate which\nhas eigenstates of linear polarization, except in some degenerate cases. In other words, the two-transparency\ncombination can be viewed as a waveplate combined with\na gyrotropic plate, whose effect is just a rotation of the\npolarization ellipse. If the purpose of the waveplate is,\nfor example, to produce a polarization state with a given\nellipticity starting with linearly polarized light, then a\ncombination waveplate can generally be used for this.\nFrom the Jones-matrix formalism one finds that a twotransparency combination produces the same output ellipticity as a single waveplate, which has retardation \u03c6\nbetween \u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 and \u03c61 + \u03c62 depending on the angle\nbetween the fast axes of the two wave plates \u03b812 . For\npractical purposes this dependence can be interpolated\nwith sufficient accuracy with\n\u03c6 = (\u03c61 + \u03c62 ) cos2 \u03b812 + (\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 ) sin2 \u03b812 .\n\n(8)\n\nA comparison of numerical simulations with this interpolation equation for a typical case is shown in Fig.11.\nTo confirm this theory, we investigated experimentally\nthe behavior of two-sheet waveplates by rotating them\nand by varying the angle between the axes of the two\nconstituent transparencies. First we tested that the ellipticity of two transparencies under the common rotation follows Eq. (3). Second, from the fits by Eq. (3) we\nfound retardation for different relative orientations of the\ntransparencies. Figure 11 summarizes the analysis and\nshows that the interpolation equation (Eq. (8)) agrees\nwith the experimental data. In principle, even a single\ntransparency sheet may have gyrotropy. Experimentally,\nwe found that a single sheet of transparency does not\nchange polarization if input polarization is aligned with\n\nRetardation, degrees\n\n100\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nAngle b/w optical axes, degrees\n\nFIG. 11: Dependence of retardation of a combination of two\nwave plates on the angle between their symmetry axes. Points\nare experimental data for black&white 3M transparencies.\nThey allow accurate fit with analytical equation Eq. (8), a\nsolid line, with \u03c62 = 72.3 degrees and \u03c61 = 38.7 degrees.\nMeasurements for individual wave plates gave \u03c62 = 74.6 degrees and \u03c61 = 37 degrees, in agreement. Small deviation is\ndue to spatial variations of retardation when transparency is\nrotated. Analytical equation for retardations \u03c61 = 23 degrees\nand \u03c62 = 57 degrees, another solid line, is also tested by comparison with numerical simulations based on the Jones-matrix\nformalism, dotted line.\n\nthe optical axis; so a single transparency behaves as a\ntrue birefringent wave plate.\nIt is interesting to note that when the angle between\nthe fast axes of two transparency sheets is 90\u25e6 , the combined retardation will be lower, meaning that the order\nis lower, and the sensitivity to variations in parameters,\nsuch as temperature and wavelength, will be also lowered\ndue to cancelation. This is a common technique for building low-order wave plates and is described for example in\nRef.[3].\nAlthough the fast wavelength dependence of the retardation for a single sheet would limit the range of operation of a transparency wave plate to \u223c10 nm (Fig.7), a\ncombined plate can work in a much larger range.\nOne additional possibility is to combine a high-quality\nwave plate, which has some retardation offset due to\noperation at a non-nominal wavelength, with a twotransparency wave plate to compensate the offset. If we\nchoose a 90-degree relative orientation in the combined\ntransparency wave plate, the temperature stability of the\nresulting wave plate will not be significantly reduced.\nSimilarly, although the temperature dependence of the\nretardation of a transparency is substantial, as shown in\nFig.12, the combined wave plate has a much weaker temperature dependence. The same is also true for the more\nconventional composite low-order optical, for example,\n\n\f7\n1.4\n\n1.3\n\nRetardation, rad\n\n1.2\n\n1.1\n\n1.0\n\n0.9\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\nTemperature, C\n\nFIG. 12: Dependence of retardation of a color transparency\non temperature at 633 nm.

Large offset \u223c 20\u03c0 rad which can be estimated\nfrom refractive index for the color transparency (Fig.8) is not\nincluded.\n\ncrystalline quartz, plates [3]. This dependence is linear\nin a wide range, which can be explained by linear thermal expansion. Assuming that the expansion is isotropic\nand \u2206l/l = \u03b1\u2206T , where \u03b1 is the coefficient of linear\nexpansion and \u2206l/l is the relative change in the length\nfor temperature increment \u2206T , the density is reduced by\n1/(1 + \u03b1\u2206T )3 and the total retardation is reduced by\n1/(1 + \u03b1\u2206T )2 \u2248 1 \u2212 2\u03b1\u2206T , where we have taken into\naccount the change in the plate's length. From the total\nretardation of the transparency of the order 20\u03c0 rad (for\nnx \u2212 ny = 0.05 \u2212 0.06, [Fig.8]), we can estimate the coefficient of linear expansion to be \u03b1 \u2248 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 K \u22121 ,\n\n[1] E.

For\nexample, it is possible to construct multi-channel thermometers based on monitoring retardation using broad\nlight beams. Another application is the conversion of UV\nor IR images into visible ones by measuring retardation\nacross the transparency (the local retardation is affected\nby heating with the absorbed UV or IR light). For small\nsizes, the transparency retardation is uniform and imaging can be implemented directly, but for large sizes nonuniformity can be taken into account with a computer.\nIt is interesting to note that using sensitive polarimeters\nwith fundamental photon shot noise on the order of 10\u22129\nrad/Hz1/2 , it should be possible to measure temperature\nchanges as small as 10\u22127 Kelvin with a single sheet and\neven better using a stack of transparencies. Other parameters such as ambient pressure or electric field (Kerr\neffect), can be measured with high sensitivity. Electric\nfield imaging can be also of interest.\nThe wavelength dependence of the retardation (Fig.7)\ncan be also used for sensitive wavelength measurements. For example, using again shot-noise limit of order\n10\u22129 rad/Hz1/2 in angular resolution, we estimate that\nchanges in wavelength on the order of 3 \u00d7 10\u22128 nm can\nbe detected for \u223c1 second of integration time.\nIn conclusion, we have analyzed polarization properties of overhead transparencies and found that they can\nbe used as inexpensive wave plates in a broad range of\nwavelengths.\nIV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\nThis work is supported by DOD MURI grant # N00014-05-1-0406.
