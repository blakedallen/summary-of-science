In the SM, flavour changing neutral currents\n(FCNC) are forbidden at tree level. The first SM contribution to the b \u2192 s\u03b3 transition appears\nat one loop level from the CKM flavour changing structure, showing the characteristic Cabibbo\nsuppression. NP contributions to b \u2192 s\u03b3 typically also arise at one loop, and in general can\nbe much larger than the SM contributions if no mechanisms for suppressing the new sources of\nflavour violation exist (see 1 for a complete set of references).\nExperimentally, the inclusive B \u2192 Xs \u03b3 Branching Ratio (BR) has been measured by\nALEPH, BELLE and CLEO, resulting in the current experimental weighted average BR(B \u2192\nXs \u03b3)exp = (3.23 \u00b1 0.41) \u00d7 10\u22124 , with new results expected shortly from BABAR and BELLE\nwhich could further reduce the experimental errors. Squeezing the theoretical uncertainties\ndown to the 10% level has been (and still is) a crucial task. The SM theoretical prediction\nhas been the subject of intensive theoretical investigation in the past several years, leading to\nthe completion of the NLO QCD calculations. The original SM NLO calculation 2 gives, for\n\n\f\u221a\n\nz = mc /mb = 0.29, the following result: BR(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3)SM = (3.28 \u00b1 0.33) \u00d7 10\u22124 . The\nmain source of theoretical uncertainty is due to NNLO QCD ambiguities. In 3 it was shown\n\u221a\nthat using z = 0.22 (i.e. the running charm mass instead of the pole mass) is more justifiable\nand causes an enhancement of about 10% of the b \u2192 s\u03b3 BR, leading to the current preferred\nvalue: BR(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3)SM = (3.73 \u00b1 0.30) \u00d7 10\u22124 . Although these theoretical uncertainties can\nbe addressed only with a complete NNLO calculation, the SM value for the BR is in agreement\nwith the experimental measurement within the 1 \u2212 2\u03c3 level.\nThe general agreement between the SM theoretical prediction and the experimental results\nhas provided useful guidelines for constraining the parameter space of models with NP present\nat the electroweak scale, such as the 2HDM and the minimal supersymmetric standard model\n(MSSM). In SUSY models superpartners and charged Higgs loops contribute to b \u2192 s\u03b3 , with\ncontributions that typically rival or exceed the SM one in size. For calculational ease only\nsimplified MSSM scenarios (like cMSSM or MSSM with minimal flavour violation (MFV)) have\nusually been assumed. Netherveless, as the origin and dynamical mechanism of SUSY breaking\nare unknown, there is no reason a priori to expect that the soft parameters will be flavourblind (or violate flavour in the same way as the SM). Of course, the kaon system has provided\nstrong FCNC constraints for the mixing of the first and second generations, which severely limit\nthe possibility of flavour violation in that sector. However the constraints for third generation\nmixings are significantly weaker, with b \u2192 s\u03b3 usually providing the most stringent constraints.\nA discussion of the b \u2192 s\u03b3 process in the general unconstrained MSSM is in principle possible, but it is necessary to deal with two unavoidable problems: (i) a large number of free,\nessentially unconstrained parameters; (ii) the need to achieve a quite accurate cancellation between the sizeable different contributions (SM, Higgs, chargino, neutralino and gluino). In the\nfollowing we'll provide a particularly interesting and simple analysis of b \u2192 s\u03b3 in the uMSSM.\n2\n\nAlternative solution to b \u2192 s\u03b3 branching ratio\n\nThe low-energy\neffective Hamiltonian, at the bottom mass scale \u03bcb , is defined as Hef f =\n\u221a\nP\n\u2217\n\u2212(4GF / 2)Vtb Vts i Ci (\u03bcb )Qi (\u03bcb ).

In the majority of the previous studies\nof the b \u2192 s\u03b3 process, the main focus was to calculate the SM or NP contributions to C7,8 . The\n\u2032\nhave usually been neglected on the assumption that they are\ncontributions coming from C7,8\nsuppressed with respect to C7,8 by the ratio ms /mb .

In the SM\nan asymmetry of approximatively 0.5%. If other sources of CP violation are present, a much\nlarger CP asymmetry could be produced.

In addition\na non-vanishing phase in the off-diagonal down-squark mass matrix is necessary. No sensitive\nbounds on this phase can be extracted from EDMs in a general flavour-violating scenario.\nIn fig. 2 (right), we show the results obtained for the BR and CP asymmetry in which\nRL , \u03b4 RR and the relative phase \u03c6 are varied arbitrarily for fixed value of m\u0303 /m\u0303 = 350/500\n\u03b423\ng\u0303\nq\u0303\n23\nand tan \u03b2 = 35.

It is possible, using C7,8\nand at the same time have a CP asymmetry even larger than \u00b110%, the sign of the asymmetry\nbeing determined by the sign of sin \u03c6. As shown in fig. 2 (right), in the relevant BR range the\nCP asymmetry range is constant. No strong dependence from tan \u03b2, in the large tan \u03b2 region, is\npresent. The points with large asymmetry (> 5%) lie in the \"flat direction\" observed in fig. 2 and\nthey have almost \u03c6 \u2248 \u00b1\u03c0 (obviously for \u03c6 = \u00b1\u03c0 the CP asymmetry vanishes). The explanation\nof this fact is the following. The numerator is proportional to sin \u03c6 and so goes to 0 as \u03c6\napproaches \u00b1\u03c0. However, at the same time it is enhanced for large MI values. This happens\nwhen the flat direction condition is (almost) satisfied. Here, in fact, a cancellation between\nthe two (large) MI terms takes place, providing the enhancement of the CP asymmetry as the\ndenominator remains practically constant, fixed by the allowed experimental measurement on\nthe BR. Note also that for parameter values outside the flat direction condition a CP asymmetry\nof a few per cent can still be observed, about ten times bigger than the SM prediction. In our\nscenario even smaller values of the CP asymmetry can be obtained, e.g. if one of the two\noff-diagonal entries is negligible, or the two MIs are \"aligned\".\n\n\fA possible method for disentangling the relative contributions to the b \u2192 s\u03b3 BR from the\nQ7 and Q\u20327 operators utilizes an analysis of the photon polarization. For simplicity, let us define\nthe following \"theoretical\" LR asymmetry at LO:\nALR (b \u2192 s\u03b3) =\n\n|C7 (\u03bcb )|2 \u2212 |C7\u2032 (\u03bcb )|2\nBR(b \u2192 s\u03b3L ) \u2212 BR(b \u2192 s\u03b3R )\n=\n,\nBR(b \u2192 s\u03b3L ) + BR(b \u2192 s\u03b3R )\n|C7 (\u03bcb )|2 + |C7\u2032 (\u03bcb )|2\n\n(7)\n\nwhich could in principle disinguish between C7 and C7\u2032 dominated scenarios. Here L,R is the\npolarization of the external photon. This quantity is related to the quark chiralities of the Q7 , Q\u20327\noperators. Such a measurement is not yet available, as only the average quantity BR(b \u2192 s\u03b3L )+\nBR(b \u2192 s\u03b3R ) is reported experimentally. In the SM case, and in general in all the MFV and\nmSUGRA scenarios, only the C7 coefficient gives a non-negligible contribution to the b \u2192 s\u03b3 BR,\nin such a way that ALR (b \u2192 s\u03b3) = 1. In our scenario, where the total contribution to C7 is\nnegligible, one obtains ALR (b \u2192 s\u03b3) = \u22121. In any other uMSSM scenario, any LR asymmetry\nbetween 1 and \u22121 is allowed. Consequently, a measurement of ALR (b \u2192 s\u03b3) different from one\nwill be a clear indication of physics beyond the SM with a non-minimal flavour structure.\n3\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have discussed an alternative explanation of the b \u2192 s\u03b3 BR in the unconstrained MSSM.\nWe analyzed in particular the gluino contribution to the WC C7\u2032 associated with the chirality\nRL and\noperator Q\u20327 . We show that this coefficient arises mainly from two off-diagonal entries: \u03b423\nRR\n\u03b423 . For scenarios where the C7,8 contributions to b \u2192 s\u03b3 are small (i.e. for regions in the\nMSSM parameter space where Ws, Higgs, chargino and gluino contributions to C7,8 tend to\n\u2032\nprovides the dominant effect. We derived absolute bounds separately\ncancel each other), C7,8\nRL , \u03b4 RR ) parameter\non each of these coefficients. We then described the allowed region of (\u03b423\n23\nspace, as a function of tan \u03b2. We observed that (for a fixed ratio m\u0303g\u0303 /m\u0303q\u0303 and for each chosen\nvalue of \u03bc tan \u03b2), there exists a \"flat direction\" where large (even O(1)) off-diagonal entries\nare allowed. For the majority of parameter space the CP asymmetry is less than 5%, even if\nasymmetries as large as 20% can be obtained along these \"flat directions\". Finally, we suggested\nthat the measure of the LR asymmetry could help to disentangle the C7 from the C7\u2032 contribution\nto the b \u2192 s\u03b3 BR. Any ALR (b \u2192 s\u03b3 ) 6= 1 would be an irrefutable proof, not only of physics\nbeyond the SM, but also it would indicate the existence of a non-minimal flavour violation\nstructure of the down-squark mass matrix. It would be very interesting if such a quantity could\nbe measured. One implication of our analysis is that previous results on MSSM parameters,\nincluding constraints on the \"sign of \u03bc\"b which are more model-dependent than has generally\nbeen assumed.\nReferences\n1.
