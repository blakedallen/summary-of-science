Bowdery\u2217\nDepartment of Physics, Lancaster University\nLancaster, LA1 4YB, UK\n13 January 2003\n\narXiv:hep-ph/0301083v1 13 Jan 2003\n\nAbstract\nThere could be a Higgs boson with a mass less than 100 GeV/c2 in the LEP data if its decay\nwidth and modes are not dominated by b quarks. At present, the quantum interference between\nsignal and background processes has not been considered in flavour independent searches but when\nit is, the long-sought particle may appear.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe search for a Higgs boson is arguably the top priority of particle physics today. It is also the\nmost tantalizing. On the one hand, direct searches at LEP II have set lower limits of 114 GeV/c2 [1]\nfor a Standard Model Higgs boson and 89.9 GeV/c2 for the Minimal Supersymmetric Model Higgs\n[2]. On the other hand, indirect evidence from virtual Higgs effects in electroweak fits to LEP, SLC\nand Tevatron data suggest a Higgs exists with a mass significantly lower than these bounds. The fits\nto the Z data imply a mass of about 81 GeV/c2 [3, 4] while the latest fit to the W data using the\nmeasured top quark mass gives a Higgs mass of just 26 GeV/c2 [5]. Of course, the uncertainties are\nlarge (30-50 GeV/c2 ) in both types of fit but nevertheless there is a growing feeling that these fits and\nthe direct search result are an indication of a deviation from the Standard Model.\nThe assumption is that, for some reason, the Higgs mass is larger than the central value predicted\nby the fits. However this may not be so. In a companion paper [6] we have proposed a scenario with\na universal Higgs-fermion coupling and its application to a Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) of\ntype II. With some reasonable parameters, a Higgs boson with a mass compatible with the fit values\nbut a hadronic branching ratio of between 66% and 80% is predicted. These hadronic jet flavours are\nequally u and c (not b) with the remaining decays being to invisible neutrinos.\nAlthough such a model sidesteps the limits imposed by the standard analyses quoted above, the\nLEP Higgs Working Group has combined flavour independent Higgs search results from the four LEP\ncollaborations [7, 8, 9, 10] and produced a paper, with preliminary results [11], which appears to\nimpose serious constraints. At face value, figure 2 from that paper suggests that, with a Z-Higgs\nproduction cross section roughly equal to the Standard Model rate and a hadronic branching ratio of\nabout 80%, there can be no Higgs boson with a mass below about 110 GeV/c2 .\n\n2\n\nFlaws in the Flavour Independent Higgs Search\n\nThe flavour independent Higgs search has two significant flaws. Firstly the decay width of the Higgs\nboson in the Universal Higgs-Fermion Coupling model could be much larger than orthodox models\nand this needs to be taken into consideration.\nSecondly, and more importantly, no account has been taken of any quantum interference between\nthe signal and background. The signal process is e+ e\u2212 \u2192 HZ \u2192 4-jets while the background processes\nare e+ e\u2212 \u2192 ZZ \u2192 4-jets and e+ e\u2212 \u2192 W + W \u2212 \u2192 4-jets. The interference may be significant because\n\u2217\n\nE-mail: chris.bowdery@physics.org\n\n1\n\n\fthe H could have a similar mass to the W and Z and similar quark branching ratios. (Of course, the\nZ and W are spin one while the H is spin zero.)\nThe result of such interference could be dips and rises in the production cross-section rather than\na simple step. Whether this is what is seen in figure 2 of the LEP Higgs Working Group paper is\nimpossible to tell but it is intiguing. Of course a careful simulation of the interference (if any) will\nbe needed and we encourage the LEP Higgs Working Group to undertake this analysis as soon as\npossible. If a Higgs boson does hide in the LEP data, presumably charm tagging as a function of the\nelectron-positron centre-of-mass energy will be required to dig it out.\n\n3\n\nConclusion\n\nThe current flavour independent Higgs search result from LEP cannot currently exclude a low mass\nHiggs boson with properties similar to a Z until quantum interference is simulated between HZ and\nZZ production and the effect of broad Higgs decay widths are considered. Consequently the central\nresult from the indirect (electroweak fit) Higgs searches is still viable.\n\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank Bill Murray for drawing my attention to the flavour independent search paper.\n\nReferences\n[1] CERN-EP/2001-055, LEP Higgs working group.\n[2] K.
