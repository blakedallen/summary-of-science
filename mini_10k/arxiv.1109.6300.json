Two essential parameters are adjusted to fit the data, one being the inverse\nslope of the thermal distribution and the other revealing the degree of momentum degradation\nin the medium. Various combinations of thermal and shower parton components are calculated,\nshowing the dominance of minijets. The effect of minijets is to produce harder baryons than mesons\nresulting in their ratio to peak at around pT \u223c 3 GeV/c. Substantial portion of the jet energy\nis found to be lost to the dense medium before the partons emerge at the surface to undergo\nhadronization by recombination.\n\n1\n\n\fI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nRecent data from ALICE on Pb-Pb collisions at\n\n\u221a\n\nsN N = 2.76 TeV provide the first\n\nglimpse of the transverse-momentum (pT ) distributions of identified hadrons produced at\nthe Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [1]. Although the pT ranges are from 0 to 3 GeV/c only\nfor \u03c0 and p, and up to 5 GeV/c for K 0 and \u039b0 , which are very low by LHC standards,\nthere are already features that are unexpected by extrapolation from RHIC [2]. The proton\ndistribution seems to be pushed harder to higher pT so that the p/\u03c0 + ratio, as well as the\np\u0304/\u03c0 \u2212 ratio, continue to rise up to the highest detected momentum at pT \u2248 3 GeV/c. The\n\u039b/K ratio does show a well-developed peak at pT = 3 GeV/c, and the magnitude of the\nratio increases with centrality, exceeding 1.5 at 0-5% centrality. Since no model-calculation\nhas been cited in Refs. [1, 2] to indicate the existence of any satisfactory explanation of the\ndata, it is important to investigate this problem and develop a model that can accommodate\nall aspects of the pT distributions for \u03c0, K, p and \u039b production up to 5 GeV/c.\nThe region of low and intermediate transverse momenta, 0 < pT < 5 GeV/c, is difficult\nfor theoretical treatment that can claim validity throughout the whole range. It is too low\nfor perturbative QCD and includes pT too high for conventional hydrodynamics. In our\nstudy here we focus only on the hadronization process for which we use the recombination model that has been shown to be effective in interpreting the data at intermediate pT\n[3]. The input involves thermal and shower parton distributions at late time that are phenomenological in the sense of having some parameters not determined from first principles.\nHowever, our approach has the advantage of making transparent the common origin of the\nvarious components that contribute to the spectra of different hadrons produced. Since the\nrecombination model has been successful in explaining the large baryon/meson ratio found\nat RHIC [4\u20136], it is sensible to extend that approach here in examining its applicability at\nLHC. It is generally recognized that at high energy in the TeV regime minijets are copiously\nproduced from semihard scatterings. The density of shower partons from such minijets [7, 8]\nis therefore expected to be much higher than at RHIC. On the other hand, thermal partons\nat hadronization should not depend sensitively on the collision energy, since the hadronization of a system of higher initial density occurs later when the thermal medium can expand\nto a lower local density in order for confinement to take place. Thus the mixture of shower\nand thermal partons at late time at LHC should be very different from that at RHIC. Since\n2\n\n\fshower partons are harder than thermal partons, we therefore expect the produced hadrons\nto be also harder - more so for the baryons than mesons due to their larger number of\nconstituents in the recombination model. This is qualitatively the short explanation for why\nthe ALICE data exhibit harder baryon spectra compared to the RHIC data. The essence of\nthis work is to carry out the investigation quantitatively.\nThe dense partonic medium created at LHC can lead to severe attenuating effects on\nsemihard partons that traverse the medium. One can focus on the various mechanisms of\nenergy loss in QCD, as in [9], but such studies of medium effects do not lend themselves\nreadily to the analysis of the hadronization process outside the medium, which is our goal.\nA template for a phenomenological description of the medium effects has been found in Ref.\n[10] that takes geometrical properties of Au-Au collisions at RHIC into consideration. We\nshall use the general form of that study for LHC, but not its details. With the assumption\nof the dominance of gluon jets for the determination of all shower partons, the effect of jet\nquenching is common to all flavors of shower partons that undergo hadron formation outside\nthe medium. Thus the central issues in this work are on the various ways in which thermal\nand shower partons can recombine at pT < 5 GeV/c in Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV. To\nachieve a satisfactory description of the spectra of all identified species is our immediate\ngoal so that the study of hadron production at higher pT can follow at a later stage on a\nfirm footing.\n\nII.\n\nMESON AND BARYON INCLUSIVE pT DISTRIBUTIONS\n\nLet us first collect here the basic equations in the recombination model developed previously [8, 10]. For the invariant pT distributions of meson and baryons averaged over \u03b7 and\n\u03c6 at midrapidity, we may use the one-dimensional form\nZ\nM\ndp1 dp2\n0 dN\n=\nFq1 q\u03042 (p1 , p2 )RqM1 ,q\u03042 (p1 , p2 , pT ),\np\ndpT\np p\n\" 13 2 #\nZ\nY dpi\ndN B\np0\nFq1 q2 q3 (p1 , p2 , p3 )RqB1 ,q2 ,q3 (p1 , p2 , p3 , pT ),\n=\ndpT\npi\ni=1\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nwhere pi is the transverse momentum (with the subscript T omitted) of one of the recombining quarks qi , whose evolution from a parton emitted at the medium surface to a valon\n(the constituent quark of the hadron to be formed) is a dressing process that preserves its\n3\n\n\fmomentum [11]. The recombination functions (RFs), RM,B , that include the effects of dressing and hadronic structure, have been determined previously and will be given below. We\nnote here that our dN h /dpT should be identified with the experimental dN/2\u03c0d\u03b7dpT , which\nintegrates over all \u03c6, while our quantity is defined as averages over \u03c6 and \u03b7. The parton\ndistributions can be partitioned into various components represented symbolically by\nFq1 q\u03042 = T T + T S + SS,\nFq1 q2 q3 = T T T + T T S + T SS + SSS,\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nwhere T and S are the invariant distributions of thermal and shower partons, respectively.\nThere can be many terms within each of the components shown above.\nIt should be noted that the nature of time evolution of the system is not specified in\nEqs. (1) - (4). The recombination model describes hadronization at late time. Thus T and\nS distributions are model inputs at that time that are appropriate for particular collision\nsystems. The thermal distribution should not depend sensitively on the collision energy,\nsince the density of the thermal system must be reduced by expansion to around the same\nlevel at any collision energy in order for hadronization to occur. Thus the thermal parton\ndistribution that we adopt has the same form as before [8]\nT (p1 ) = p1\n\ndNqT\n= Cp1 e\u2212p1 /T ,\ndp1\n\n(5)\n\nwhere C has the dimension of inverse momentum. The prefactor p1 is necessary to yield the\nexponential behavior for the thermal component of the hadronic distribution dNh /pT dpT , as\nwe shall see after specifying the RF. [See Eq. (31) below.] On the other hand, the properties\nof shower distribution do depend strongly on the collision energy, not only because of the\nincreased rate of creation of hard partons, but also due to the quenching effect of the denser\nmedium. With \u03be used as a parameter that describes an aspect of the momentum degradation\nin the medium, Fi (q, \u03be) is the hard or semi-hard parton distribution at the surface of the\nmedium to be discussed in detail below. For now we just show the shower distribution as\nZ\ndq X\nFi (q, \u03be)Si (p2 /q),\n(6)\nS(p2 , \u03be) =\nq i\nwhere Si (z) is the shower parton distribution (SPD) in a jet of type i with momentum\nfraction z. In Refs. [7, 12] SPD is determined by regarding the fragmentation function (FF),\n4\n\n\fDi (x), as being the recombination product of two shower partons\n\u001a\n\u0013\u001b\n\u0012\nZ\ndx1 dx2\nx2\nq\nq\u0304\n\u03c0\nxDi (x) =\nSi (x1 ), Si\nRq\u03c0q\u0304 (x1 , x2 , x),\nx1 x2\n1 \u2212 x1\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the curly brackets denote symmetrization of the leading parton momentum fractions\nx1 and x2 .\nUsing Eqs.

Geometrically, \u03be depends on where the trajectory is between the center and the\nperiphery of the overlap, and dynamically it depends on the energy loss along the path, as\nwill be discussed in more detail in the next section.\nFor notational brevity we define\n \u0304 =\nF\u0304i (q, \u03be)\n\nZ\n\nd\u03beP (\u03be, \u03c6, b)Fi(q, \u03be)\n\nwhere \u03be \u0304 depends on \u03c6 and b, and get from Eqs. (9) and (11)\nZ\ndN\u03c0T S\n2\ndp1 dp2 q\u0304\n \u0304 \u03c0 (p1 , p2 , pT ),\n= 2\nT (p1 )S q (p2 , \u03be)R\nq q\u0304\npT dpT\npT\np1 p2\n\n(13)\n\n(14)\n\nwhere\n \u0304 =\nS (p2 , \u03be)\nq\n\nZ\n\ndq X\n \u0304 q (p2 /q)\nF\u0304i (q, \u03be)S\ni\nq i\n5\n\n(15)\n\n\fthat follows obviously from Eqs. (6) and (13), except to emphasize that the medium effect is\n \u0304 not in S q (p2 /q). That is, the FF in Eq. (7) is for partons outside the medium and\nin F\u0304i (q, \u03be),\ni\n\nis therefore not modified by it. The factor of 2 in Eq. (14) arises from the two distinguishable\n \u0304\n\n \u0304\n\ncomponents of T u (1)S d (2) + T d (1)S u (2). Such a factor is absent in the T T term because\n \u0304\n\n \u0304\n\nT u (1)T d (2) and T d (1)T u (2) are indistinguishable in a thermalized medium of q and q\u0304. For\nK + production we have for T S two terms of us\u0304, so we obtain\nZ\n\u0003\ndNKT S\ndp1 dp2 \u0002 q\n1\n \u0304 + T s (p2 )S q (p1 , \u03be)\n \u0304 RK (p1 , p2 , pT ),\nT (p1 )S s (p2 , \u03be)\n= 0\npT dpT\np pT\np1 p2\n\n(16)\n\nwhere S s is as defined in Eq. (15), but with Siq replaced by Sis . Because of the mass difference\nbetween the two constituents of K, RK (p1 , p2 , pT ) is not symmetric under the interchange\n\nof p1 and p2 ; moreover, the two terms in the square brackets are different. Since we consider\nonly hadron production at mid-rapidity here, we may approximate p0 by the transverse mass\nmT , where\nmT = (m2h + p2T )1/2 .\n\n(17)\n\nFor h = K, p and \u039b, it can be significantly different from pT when pT is small, and can cause\nthe low-pT spectra to deviate from the exponential behavior of the pion spectrum.\nThe recombination of shower partons from the same jet is equivalent to fragmentation,\nso we have\nSS\ndNM\n1\n=\npT dpT\nmT pT\n\nZ\n\ndq X\npT\nF\u0304i (q, \u03be\u0304) DiM\nq i\nq\n\n\u0012\n\npT\nq\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(18)\n\nWe shall denote it as (SS)1j . It is also possible for shower partons from adjacent minijets\nto recombine; we shall refer to such processes as (SS)2j .\nFor baryon production the parton distribution shown in Eq. (4) has many components\nthat can be expressed more explicitly, though still symbolically condensed, as\nFq1 q2 q3 = T T T + T T S + T (SS)1j + (SSS)1j + T (SS)2j + ((SS)1j S)2j + (SSS)3j (19)\nin obvious notation except for ((SS)1j S)2j which means that two shower-partons are from\n1-jet and the third one from a second jet. We have found that all terms from multi-jets are\nsmall for pT < 5 GeV/c, so in this paper we ignore 2j and 3j and omit the specification 1j,\nsince only 1-jet is considered. If we use the simplified notation to abbreviate Eqs. (14) and\n(16) as\n(T S)\u03c0 = 2Tq Sq ,\n\n(T S)K = Tq Ss + Ts Sq ,\n6\n\n(20)\n\n\fthen in a similar way we shorten the expression for p and \u039b as\n(T T S)p = Tq Tq (Su + Sd ),\n\n(21)\n\n(T (SS))p = Tq (Su Sd + Su Su ),\n\n(22)\n\n(SSS)p = Su Su Sd ,\n\n(23)\n\n(T T S)\u039b = Tq (Tq Ss + 2Ts Sq ),\n\n(24)\n\n(T (SS))\u039b = 2Tq Sq Ss + Ts Su Sd ,\n\n(25)\n\n(SSS)\u039b = Su Sd Ss ,\n\n(26)\n\nThe recombination functions (RFs) have been determined from the study of hadronic\nstructure [8, 11, 13]. They are given below in terms of yi , which is the momentum fraction\nof a valon (which plays the role in the scattering problem as a constituent quark does in the\nbound-state problem) relative to the pT of the produced hadron; i.e., yi = pi /pT ,\nR\u03c0 (y1 , y2) = y1 y2 \u03b4(y1 + y2 \u2212 1),\n\n(27)\n\nRK (y1 , y2) = B \u22121 (a + 1, b + 1)y1a+1y2b+1 \u03b4(y1 + y2 \u2212 1),\n\n(28)\n\nB\nNB (y1 y2 )\u03b1+1 y3\u03b2+1\u03b4(y1 + y2 + y3 \u2212 1),\nRB (y1 , y2 , y3) = gst\n\n(29)\n\nNB = [B(\u03b1 + 1, \u03b1 + \u03b2 + 2)B(\u03b1 + 1, \u03b2 + 1)]\u22121 ,\n\n(30)\n\nwhere\n\nB\nand gst\nis a statistical factor. From previous studies it has been determined that a = 1, b = 2\n\n[14], \u03b1 = 1.75, \u03b2 = 1.05 for proton [13] and \u03b1 = 1, \u03b2 = 2 for \u039b [14]. For pion a = b = 0\nbecause its mass is especially low due to its being a Goldstone boson, so tight binding of\nthe constituent quarks leads to broad distribution in yi .\nAn immediate consequence of the momentum-conserving \u03b4-functions in the RFs is the\nsimplification of the hadronic distributions. We illustrate that by writing out explicitly the\npion distributions. Substituting Eq. (27) in (8) and (14), we get\nC 2 \u2212pT /T\ndN\u03c0T T\n=\ne\n,\npT dpT\n6\nZ\ndN\u03c0T S\n2C pT\n \u0304\n= 3\ndp1 p1 e\u2212p1 /T S q (pT \u2212 p1 , \u03be),\npT dpT\npT 0\n\n(31)\n(32)\n\nwhere the pion mass in p0 = mT is neglected. The SS component can be written in terms\nof FF as in Eq. (18), for which the properties of RF are already used in relating S to D in\n7\n\n\fEq. (7). Similar equations as the two above can be exhibited for other hadrons, as done in\nAppendix A. Here we show the thermal component of proton\ndNpT T T\np2\n= Np\u2032 C 3 T e\u2212pT /T ,\npT dpT\nmT\n\n(33)\n\np\nwhere Np\u2032 = gst\nNB B(\u03b1+2, \u03b2 +2)B(\u03b1+2, \u03b1+\u03b2 +4), so that we can emphasize, by comparing\n\nEqs. (31) and (33), that pion and proton have the same exponential factors; however, the\nlatter has a prefactor p2T /mT that arises from the kinematics of recombination, causing the\n\u03c0 and p spectra to differ at low pT . Note that the inverse slopes T for both spectra are the\nsame.\nThe objective in this section to express the hadronic spectra in terms of the parton\ndistributions is now accomplished. In the following it is then only necessary for us to focus\non the latter in order to calculate the former.\n\nIII.\n\nTHERMAL AND SHOWER PARTONS\n\nAs noted at the end of the preceding section the thermal distributions of p and \u03c0 have\nthe same inverse slope T , inherited from the thermal partons, whose invariant distribution\nis given in Eq. (5). This is the characteristic property of recombination that deviates from\nthe hydrodynamical description where Tslope depends on the hadron mass due to flow effect\n[15]. There is apparent disparity between the p and \u03c0 spectra in the data; nevertheless,\nbecause of the prefactor p2T /mT for proton and of the dominant resonance contribution to\npion for pT < 1 GeV/c, it does not mean that it is impossible to have a good description of\nboth spectra using one value of T , as will be shown below.\nWe now extend the universality of the thermal parton distribution to include the strange\nsector in hadron production at LHC. In the TeV realm of collision energies it is expected\nthat the light and strange quarks are fully equilibrated before hadronization. If that is so,\nthen the same thermal distribution given in Eq. (5) should be valid for u, d and s quarks,\nthe consequence of which can readily be checked in our model calculation. We note that the\nissue is not one that concerns hadronic masses, since the system under discussion consists\nonly of thermal partons in local equilibrium. More specifically, before the recombination\nmechanism is applied, we assume that all gluons are converted to u, d and s quarks and\ntheir antiquarks, which form the initial states of specific channels for hadronization [11].\n8\n\n\fThermal gluons do not fragment in the usual sense. Even fragmentation of gluon jets is\ntreated by conversion to q and q\u0304 before recombination.\nFor shower partons let us begin by first summarizing the subject of momentum degradation treated in Ref. [10]. At RHIC the pT , \u03c6 and centrality (c) dependencies of the nuclear\nmodification factor RAA (pT , \u03c6, c) impose stringent constraints on the dynamical process of\nenergy loss. The problem is complicated because of both the geometrical and dynamical\naspects of the description of the parton's traversal through a non-uniform medium. For\na given point (x0 , y0) in the transverse plane where a hard parton is created in the initial\nsystem in a collision at impact parameter b, one has to calculate the geometrical path length\nl(x0 , y0, \u03c6, b) of a path at angle \u03c6 and then the medium effect along that path. As the system expands, l becomes longer, but the local density becomes lower, so those compensating\neffects on the net energy loss result in a dynamical path length \u03be that can be related to l\nthrough an undetermined parameter but without a time-dependent transport description.\nUpon averaging over all creation points (x0 , y0 ), one arrives at a probability distribution on\n\u03be, denoted by P (\u03be, \u03c6, b), that relates the average parton distribution F\u0304i (q, \u03c6, b) with momentum q at the medium surface to the distribution, Fi (q, \u03be), with a definite \u03be by a weighted\naverage\nF\u0304i (q, \u03c6, b) =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03beP (\u03be, \u03c6, b)Fi(q, \u03be).\n\n(34)\n\nThis is a general relationship with details all contained in P (\u03be, \u03c6, b). The parton distribution\nFi (q, \u03be) is related in turn to the distribution fi (k) at the point of creation by\nZ\nFi (q, \u03be) =\ndkkfi (k)G(k, q, \u03be),\n\n(35)\n\nwhere fi (k) is the parton density in the phase space kdk. G(k, q, \u03be) is the momentum\ndegradation function from k to q:\nG(k, q, \u03be) = q\u03b4(q \u2212 ke\u2212\u03be ).\n\n(36)\n\nIn [10] the RHIC data [16] on RAA (pT , \u03c6, c) are used to constrain the properties of\nP (\u03be, \u03c6, b). It is found that P (\u03be, \u03c6, b) can be expressed in some scaling form involving the\nR\n \u0304 where \u03be(\u03c6,\n \u0304 b) = d\u03be \u03beP (\u03be, \u03c6, b). For our purpose here, let us not\nscaling variable z = \u03be/\u03be,\nrepeat the details of that study for Pb-Pb collisions at LHC, especially when we restrict\n\nour attention in this work to only the data at most central collisions. We circumvent the\n9\n\n\fcomplications by deriving a simple parametric form as follows. From Eqs. (13), (34)-(36)\nwe have for the average parton distribution at the surface\nZ\n \u0304 = d\u03beP (\u03be, \u03c6, b)q 2e2\u03be fi (qe\u03be ),\nF\u0304i (q, \u03be)\n\n(37)\n\nwhich we parametrize for centrality 0 < c < 0.05 in the form\nF\u0304i (q, \u03ba) = k(q)2 fi (k(q)),\n\nk(q) = \u03baq.\n\n(38)\n\n \u0304 in Eq.\nIf the details of P (\u03be, \u03c6, b) discussed in [10] are used, it can be shown that F\u0304i (q, \u03be)\n(37) for a relevant value of \u03be \u0304 can be reproduced very closely by Eq. (38) for a corresponding\nvalue of \u03ba. Since in either case an unknown parameter is needed to represent the effect of\nmomentum degradation, we choose the latter expression that does not rely on the details\nof P (\u03be, \u03c6, b), and treat \u03ba as the key parameter to fit the data of all hadronic spectra. The\nsignificance of \u03ba is clearly the average momentum fraction, \u03ba\u22121 , that a parton retains upon\ntraversing the medium.\n\nIV.\n\nPARAMETRIZATION\n\nFor the thermal parton distribution we use the form in Eq. (5) and put\nC = 23.2 (GeV/c)\u22121\n\n(39)\n\nthat is the value determined at RHIC [8]. We shall let T be adjustable to fit the LHC\ndata at low pT . Since our aim is to reproduce the pT distributions of all identified particles\n(\u03c0, K, p, \u039b), the use of one parameter T for all thermal partons is not only economical, but\nwould indeed be remarkable, if achieved. Unlike in hydrodynamical studies that consider\nmass-dependent flow effect, our approach incorporates the effects of minijets on the hadronic\nspectra at low pT , allowing the recombination processes to determine the similar or dissimilar\nbehaviors of different hadronic species.\nThe parton distributions, fi (k), at creation have been determined in Ref. [17] for Au-Au\ncollision at 0.2 TeV and for Pb-Pb collision at 5.5 TeV. The form used is\nfi (k) = K\n\nA\n,\n(1 + k/B)n\n\n10\n\n(40)\n\n\fwhere K = 2.5, A, B and n are tabulated for various quarks and gluon. For\n\n\u221a\n\nsN N = 2.76\n\nTeV we use logarithmic interpolation between the two energies for lnA, B and n. More\nspecifically, for gluons we use\nA = 6.2 \u00d7 104 GeV\u22122 ,\n\nB = 0.98 GeV,\n\nn = 6.22.\n\n(41)\n\nOther parameters can similarly be obtained. The quark contributions are found to be\nsignificantly less than the gluon contribution. To make our calculation transparent, we shall\nassume the dominance of gluon jets and let the summation over parton species in all hard\nparton terms be represented by a factor \u03c3 times the contributions from the gluon jets only,\nwhich we shall calculate explicitly using Eqs. (40) and (41) for gluon creation at k > 3\nP\nGeV/c. That is, we approximate i Fi by \u03c3Fg and shall use \u03c3 = 1.2 in the calculation,\nsince the quark jets amount to roughly 20% of the gluon jet.\n\nSince the parton distribution F\u0304i (q, \u03ba) is not reliable for q < 3 GeV/c, its contribution at\nlow q is cut off by a smooth function which we take to be\n\u0002\n\u0003\u22121\ng(q) = 1 + e(3.5\u2212q)/0.5\n.\n\n(42)\n\nWith this cut-off factor we may then let the q integrals in all equations, such as in Eqs. (6)\nand (15), to start at q = 0. Shower parton with momentum pj has a momentum fraction\nx = pj /q that peaks at small x; consequently, even for q > 3 GeV/c, the density of shower\npartons at pj < 1 GeV/c can become very high at LHC. At low pT we know that thermal\npartons are important. How to separate the shower partons from the thermal partons at low\npj is not very well defined. The energy lost by semihard partons as they traverse the medium\ncan enhance the thermal motion of the soft partons in the vicinities of their trajectories,\nthereby contributing to a component of the thermal partons that are intimately related to\nthe soft component of the shower partons. The effective T that we shall determine includes\nenhanced thermal partons due to the energy loss of the semihard partons. Because of that\neffect the distributions of shower partons that are to be determined from the FF according to\nEq. (7) must be modified at low x so that S(p1 ) will not exceed T (p1 ). That modification is\ndiscussed in detail in Appendix B. The phenomenological basis that supports our approach\nto the problem is the success in treating the pion and proton spectra at RHIC from a\ncommon partonic distribution characterized by a universal T [8, 18, 19]. Here we apply the\nsame idea to the problem at LHC.\n11\n\n\fTo summarize, we have two basic parameters to adjust to fit a large collection of data\nfrom LHC. Those parameters are T and \u03ba that characterize the thermal medium and its\nquenching effects on minijets. Due to the copious production of minijets at LHC, we expect\nthat the relative magnitudes of the parton distributions T and S will be different from those\nat RHIC. They contribute to hadronic distributions in the intermediate range 1 < pT < 5\nGeV/c that is hard to quantify in other approaches. Thus our phenomenological treatment\nthat employs two free parameters is a worthwhile endeavor, provided that all four hadronic\nspectra can be reproduced.\n4\n\ntotal\n\n\u22122\n\ndN /p dp [(GeV/c) ]\n\n10\n\nwith resonance\n2\n\nTT\nTS\nSS\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n\u03c0\n\nT\n\nT\n\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n0\n\n+\n\n\u03c0\n1\n\nALICE\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\np (GeV/c)\nT\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Transverse momentum distribution of pion produced in Pb-Pb collision at\n\u221a\nsN N = 2.76 TeV.

The agreement between the black lines and the data points for K, p and \u039b in Figs.\n2-4 are evidently very good throughout the whole region where data exist.\nIn the case of pion the calculated total falls below the data for pT < 1.5 GeV/c. The\ndashed (black) line is drawn to fit that region and represents the extra contribution from the\ndecay of resonances. Such a component cannot at present be calculated in this formalism,\nbecause the RFs have been derived from the hadronic structures of the lowest bound states.\nResonances involve orbital excitations for which the RFs have not been investigated. The\ndominance of resonance production at low pT is a known fact even for meson-proton collisions\n\u221a\nat s = 53 GeV [20] where \u03c1 and \u03c9 contributions to the \u03c0 spectra exceed 60% [21]. At LHC\nnot only do vector and tensor mesons decay into pions, but various baryon resonances can\nalso contribute to additional pions. Since resonance contribution is also present at RHIC,\nbut not considered in Ref. [8], we put aside the region at pT < 1 GeV/c so as to give emphasis\nto the difference between what we can calculate at LHC and RHIC for pT > 1 GeV/c.\n14\n\n\fWhat is notable in these spectra is the important role that the shower parton S plays\nthroughout the pT range shown. In all of them T S and T T S components are of the same\nmagnitudes as T T and T T T , or higher. In fact, for pT > 0.5 GeV/c, T S is larger than\nT T , and T T S is larger than T T T for all hadrons produced. It means that at LHC minijets\nare pervasive and their effects dominate the spectra throughout the low and intermediate\npT regions. For pT < 5 GeV/c, SS, T SS and SSS components are all negligible. Thus\nthe traditional fragmentation of jets can be ignored. In the recombination approach to\nhadronization T S and T T S components represent the medium effect on semihard partons,\nwhich lose energy to the medium and then regain some of the momenta back by coalescing\nwith enhanced thermal partons to form hadrons. That they are important for pT > 3 GeV/c\nis expected, as has been found in the study of RHIC physics [8], but to see them as being\nso important for pT > 1 GeV/c is a new revelation at LHC.\n1\n\nparton distributions\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\nLHC\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\nRHIC\n\nS\nT\n\n\u22125\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\np (GeV/c)\n1\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) Shower and thermal parton distributions at LHC and RHIC.\n\nTo help to understand more clearly how hadron production at LHC differs from that at\nRHIC, we show in Fig. 5 the shower and thermal parton distributions at LHC and RHIC.\nS and T are as defined in Eqs. (B6) for gluon jet and in (5), and shown by red and blue\nlines, respectively. Appendix B contains the details about S at LHC, which is more than an\norder of magnitude higher than S for RHIC. On the other hand, T is the same at low p1 for\nboth energies, but the exponential decrease at intermediate p1 is steeper at RHIC (T = 0.32\nGeV) than at LHC (T = 0.38 GeV). As a consequence, T at RHIC is much larger than S\n15\n\n\f4\n\ndN\u03c0/pTdpT [(GeV/c)\u22122]\n\n10\n\nLHC\n2\n\nRHIC\n\nTS\n\n10\n\nTT\n0\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n\u22126\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\npT (GeV/c)\nFIG. 6: (Color online) Transverse momentum distributions of \u03c0 at LHC and RHIC.\n\nat p1 < 2 GeV/c and they cross over at around p1 = 3 GeV/c, whereas S and T at LHC\nare approximately the same for p1 < 2 GeV/c. These differences have significant effects on\nthe pion spectra. In Fig. 6 we compare the pT distributions of pions arising from TS and\nTT recombination at the two energies. Evidently, TT dominates over TS at pT < 3 GeV/c\nat RHIC, but TS at LHC is larger at all pT . It is then clear how minijets are so important\nat LHC that the pion spectrum become much harder than at RHIC, and it is not because\nof enhanced flow.\nAs shown in Appendix A, there are many terms in our calculation. To get a good fit\nof all four spectra with the adjustment of essentially only two parameters, T and \u03ba, is a\nsignificant achievement that provides a transparent picture of the relative importance of the\nvarious thermal and shower partons at pT < 5 GeV/c. The quality of our fits can be seen\nfrom Figs. 7 (a) and (b) where the particle ratios p/\u03c0 and \u039b/K are shown. For the former\nthe excellent agreement with data is partially due to the capability of our formalism to\nreproduce the p and \u03c0 spectra accurately and separately for pT > 1.5 GeV/c, and partially\nbecause we have included the resonance contribution to the pions at pT < 1.5 GeV/c that\nwe did not calculate. Since the reliable portion of our calculation is in the intermediate pT\nregion above 1.5 GeV/c, the peaking of the p/\u03c0 ratio at pT \u2248 3 GeV/c and the gentle falloff\nabove that are our prediction. The \u039b/K ratio in Fig. 7(b) does not show perfect agreement,\n\n16\n\n\fbut it is in linear scale that amplifies the deviations of the calculated spectra from the data,\nwhich are seen in Figs. 2 and 4 to be well reproduced in log scale. From that more tolerant\npoint of view the general agreement of the calculated ratio with data may be regarded as\nremarkably good. The qualitative notion gained from the data that baryons are produced\nwith more transverse momentum [2] is now given a quantitative interpretation that shower\npartons from minijets harden the pT spectra because of the larger phase space opened up\nat higher pT when three quarks recombine, one of which being the harder shower parton (as\ncan be seen in Fig. 10 in Appendix B).\n2\n0\n\n1.5\n\n\u039b/K\n\np/\u03c0+\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n0.5\n\n\u22122\n\nALICE\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nALICE\n\n(a)\n4\n\n0\n\n5\n\n1\n\n2\n\np (GeV/c)\n\n3\n\n(b)\n4\n\n5\n\np (GeV/c)\n\nT\n\nT\n\nFIG. 7: Particle ratios of (a) p/\u03c0 and (b) \u039b/K.

If we regard \u039b0\nas representative of \u03a3+ , then adding our result of \u03c0, K, p and \u039b should come close to all\ncharges. In Fig. 8 we show the sum of those four by the black line, which almost saturates\nthe data, leaving very little room for baryons that are not included. The plot ends at pT \u223c 5\nGeV/c where our calculation ends, but the data go on to pT \u223c 15 GeV/c. The mismatch\nwill be large for pT > 5 GeV/c due to aspects of jet physics that we have not taken into\naccount in the present study, but will be examined in the future.\nThe value of T at 0.38 GeV is slightly larger than 0.32 GeV that was determined for\nthermal partons at RHIC [8]. That is eminently reasonable for the hotter plasma created at\nLHC. Since the thermal partons that participate in hadronization are at late time, T is not\nthe temperature of the system at initial equilibration time, which would be much higher.\nAfter expansion and cooling the value at LHC is, nevertheless, still higher than at RHIC\nbecause there are many more minijets produced, which lose energy to the medium and raise\n17\n\n\f4\n\ntotal\n\u03c0\np\nK\n\u039b\n\n2\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\nT\n\nT\n\n\u22122\n\ndN/p dp [(GeV/c) ]\n\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n\u22126\n\n10\n\ncharged (ALICE)\n\n\u22128\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\np (GeV/c)\nT\n\nFIG. 8: (Color online) Charged particle pT distribution in black line that is the sum of the four\ncomponents \u03c0 (red), p (purple), K (blue), and \u039b (green). The data are from Ref. [23] for centrality\n0-5%.\n\nthe ambient T .\nThe value of \u03ba at 2.6 implies that on average roughly 1 \u2212 \u03ba\u22121 = 60% of the initial parton\nenergy is lost to the medium. Thus the momenta of the hard and semihard partons created\nat LHC suffer severe degradation as they traverse the dense medium. The precise value of\n\u03ba may change at higher pT since the degree of momentum degradation can depend on the\ninitial parton momentum.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have studied the properties of hadron production in the difficult intermediate pT\nregion that is too low for reliable calculation in pQCD, and too high for hydrodynamical\ndescription. Although we have been successful in reproducing the data, our main point is,\nhowever, not so much on the accuracy of the fits of the data, but on learning about the\nphysics at LHC. Since our treatment of the problem is focused only on hadronization at\nthe final stage of the evolution of the partonic system, we cannot address issues related to\nthe dynamical development in time. Nevertheless, the investigation provides quantitative\ninformation about minijets that are crucial in the understanding of the nature of hadronic\n\n18\n\n\fspectra. A distinctive feature about our approach is that the production of mesons and\nbaryons with widely different masses can be described on the basis of a common system\nof partons without any specific reference to flow. In the intermediate pT region between\n2 and 5 GeV/c, the non-flow part of the hydrodynamical description can presumably be\nrelated to the thermal-shower component of recombination. Hadron masses do not enter\nexplicitly in our calculation, although they are implicitly involved in the determination of\nthe recombination functions. The relative magnitudes of the TT, TS and SS components for\nmesons (and of TTT, TTS, TSS, and SSS components for baryons) provide a clear picture\nof the smooth transition throughout that pT region, and unify the very different hadronic\nsectors. That picture offers an illuminating complement to the conventional hydrodynamical\ndescription without contradicting it.\nWhile the shower partons from minijets play the important role in hadronization in the\nintermediate pT region, harder jets will, of course, become more important at higher pT . We\ndo not expect our description to change significantly when we extend our consideration to\nthat region, except for the need to study also multi-jet recombination. Before doing that,\nwe still have to examine the centrality dependence in the intermediate region. That subject\nis interesting not only because of the data on the second harmonic, v2 (pT ), that is usually\ninterpreted as elliptic flow, but especially because the dominance of minijets implies the\nimportance of non-flow. The \u03c6 dependence of momentum degradation at RHIC has been\nconsidered in our approach previously [10], and can be adapted for collisions at LHC. That\nwill provide another test of the validity of our finding here about the minijets.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nThis work was supported, in part, by the U. S.

We shall leave out the multi-jet (2j and 3j) contributions because\nthey are small and negligible for pT < 5 GeV/c, but we exhibit explicitly the various T\nand S combinations. As explained in Sec. IV we approximate the sum over all hard parton\nspecies by the dominant gluon jet contribution multiplied by a constant factor \u03c3 (set to be\n\u03c3 = 1.2) that roughly accounts for the combined contribution of all other quark-jet terms.\nThat significantly simplifies the calculation without compromising the general features of\nthe results.\n\n1.\n\nPion\n\ndN\u03c0T T\nC 2 \u2212pT /T\n=\ne\n,\npT dpT\n6\nZ\n2C pT\ndN\u03c0T S\n \u0304\n= 3\ndp1 p1 e\u2212p1 /T S q (pT \u2212 p1 , \u03be),\npT dpT\npT 0\nZ\ndN\u03c0SS\n1\ndq\n \u0304 \u2032 \u03c0 (pT , q),\n=\n\u03c3 F\u0304g (q, \u03be)D\ng\npT dpT\npT\nq2\n\n(A1)\n(A2)\n(A3)\n\nwhere\n \u0304 =\nS (p2 , \u03be)\nq\n\nZ\n\ndq\n \u0304 \u2032 q (p2 , q)\n\u03c3 F\u0304g (q, \u03be)S\ng\nq\n\n(A4)\n\nThe variable q is the momentum of gluon jet at the medium surface, while the index q refers\nto light quarks to be distinguished from s quark whose role in the RF of kaon is different.\nThe SPD S \u2032 qg and FF D \u2032 \u03c0g are modified at low momentum in ways discussed in Appendix B.\n\n20\n\n\f2.\n\nKaon\n\nC 2 pT\ndNKT T\n= NK B(a + 2, b + 2) K e\u2212pT /T ,\npT dpT\nmT\nZ pT\nTS\ndNK\nNK C\ndp1 pa1 (pT \u2212 p1 )b\n= K a+b+2\npT dpT\nmT pT\n0\n\u2212p1 /T s\n \u0304 + (pT \u2212 p1 )e\u2212(pT \u2212p1 )/T S q (p1 , \u03be)],\n \u0304\n\u00d7[p1 e\nS (pT \u2212 p1 , \u03be)\nZ\ndNKSS\n1\ndq\n \u0304 \u2032 K (pT , q),\n= K\n\u03c3 F\u0304g (q, \u03be)D\ng\npT dpT\nmT\nq2\n\n(A5)\n\n(A6)\n(A7)\n\nwhere S s (p2 , \u03be\u0304) is as defined in Eq.

The basic idea is already described in Refs. [7, 12]; only the parametrization is now different. Fragmentation function (FF) at high Q2 in deep inelastic scattering\ngives the hadron distribution in a quark or gluon jet. It does not specify the way in which\nhadrons are formed. In the recombination model FF is described as a two-step process, first\nthe development of shower partons in a jet, then the coalescence of the shower partons to\nform a hadron. For pion production it is as expressed in Eq. (7), which should be augmented\nby the dependence of Di\u03c0 (x, \u03bc2 ) and Sij (x, \u03bc2 ) on the energy scale \u03bc. Since the evolution\nof Di\u03c0 (x, \u03bc2 ) in \u03bc2 can be tracked experimentally and theoretically [24], the \u03bc2 dependence\nof Sij (x, \u03bc2 ) can be determined accordingly by use of Eq. (7). However, to include that dependence in the application of Sij (x) in Eq. (12) for heavy-ion collisions is too complicated\nand more meticulous than necessary in view of the many other unavoidable approximations.\nThus a fixed \u03bc2 is used in practice. For RHIC we have used \u03bc = 10 GeV [7, 12]. Now for\nLHC we continue to use the same \u03bc, since the hadronization scale at late time is the same.\nHowever, we improve the determination of the SPD and include scale-breaking effects due\n22\n\n\fto a cut-off at low p1 .\n4\n\n10\n\nKKP\ncalculation\n\n2\n\n10\n\n0\n\nD\u03c0g(x, \u03bc2)\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n\u22126\n\n\u03bc=10 GeV\n\n10\n\n\u22128\n\n10\n\n\u221210\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nx\nFIG. 9: Fit of KKP fragmentation function Dg\u03c0 (x, \u03bc2 ) [24] (squares) by Eq. (B1) using the recombination formulas Eqs. (7) and (27), as shown by the solid line.\n\nThe gluon FF Dg\u03c0 (x, \u03bc2 ) for \u03bc = 10 GeV is shown by the square points in Fig. B-1,\nfollowing the parametrization given in Ref. [24]. To reproduce that x dependence, we use\nthe SPD from gluon to light quark q\nSgq (x) = axb (1 \u2212 x)c (1 + dxe )\n\n(B1)\n\nwhere a = 0.739, b = \u22120.28, c = 4.387, d = 4.502 and e = 10.469. The solid line in Fig. 9\nshows the result of our calculation based on Eqs. (7) and (B1). The fit is evidently very\ngood.\nIn the application of Sgq (x) to hadronization processes in heavy-ion collisions, we have\ndiscussed in Sec. IV how the shower partons at very low momenta pi are merged into the\nregion dominated by thermal partons. The semihard partons lose energy to the medium\nwhose thermal partons are enhanced in such a way as to make the distinction between\nthermal and shower partons meaningless. The peaking of the SPD at very low pi is therefore\nunrealistic. Since the inverse slope of the thermal parton distribution is to be determined\nphenomenologically that includes the effect of energy loss of the semihard partons, we require\n23\n\n\fthat the SPD should not exceed the exponential behavior of the thermal partons. The scale\ninvariant thermal distribution T (p1 ) given in Eq. (5) is shown in Fig. 10 by the red line; it\n\ndips at small p1 because of the prefactor Cp1 . The integrated shower distribution Sgq (pi ),\ndefined as in Eq. (15) but for gluon jet (i = g) only and with \u03be \u0304 replaced by \u03ba in F\u0304g (q, \u03ba)\ngiven in Eq. (38), is shown as a function of p1 by the dashed line Fig. 10. We see that Sgq (p1 )\nexhibits a power-law behavior for p1 > 1 GeV/c that is expected, and is larger than the\nexponential behavior of T (p1 ). However, the peaking at low p1 for p1 < 0.5 GeV/c is due to\nthe unreliability of the method of determining Sgq (x) at low x. Since for physical reasons we\n\nwant the thermal partons to dominate at low p1 , we introduce a cut-off factor on the SPD.\nA cut-off with a particular scale implies breaking of scale-invariance described by x. Such\na breaking is reasonable in low-q processes. If we write x = pT /q in Dg\u03c0 (x), but now in the\nnon-scaling form Dg\u03c0 (pT , q), we introduce the low-pT cut-off as follows\n\u03c0\n\nD \u2032 g (pT , q) = Dg\u03c0 (pT , q)\u03b31(pT ),\n\n2\n\n\u03b31 (pT ) = 1 \u2212 e\u2212pT .\n\nThe shower parton distribution must therefore also be modified in accordance to\nZ pT\n1\npT \u2032 \u03c0\nq\nq\nD (pT , q) =\ndp1 S \u2032 g (p1 , q)S \u2032g (pT \u2212 p1 , q \u2212 p1 ),\nq g\npT 0\n\n(B2)\n\n(B3)\n\nwhere Eq. (27) is used in (7) with x1 = p1 /q. The modified S \u2032 qg (p1 , q) is now\nq\n\nS \u2032 g (p1 , q) = Sgq (p1 /q)\u03b32 (p1 ),\n\n(B4)\n\nwhere the corresponding cut-off in p1 is\n2\n\n\u03b32 (p1 ) = 1 \u2212 e\u2212(p1 /0.3) .\n\n(B5)\n\nIt can be demonstrated that the two damping factors \u03b31 (pT ) and \u03b32 (p1 ) are coordinated to\nsatisfy Eq. (B3) for all pT in the range of 1 < pT < 15 GeV/c.\nThe consequence of this cut-off on the integrated shower distribution\nZ\ndq\nq\n\u2032q\nS g (p1 , \u03ba) =\nF\u0304g (q, \u03ba)S \u2032 g (p1 , q)\nq\n\n(B6)\n\nis shown by the solid (black) line in Fig. 10. Note that it is now just lower than the red line\nof the thermal distribution T (p1 ) for p1 < 0.5 GeV/c,which is the criterion of this cut-off.\nIn actual computation of the hadronic spectra this modified distribution S \u2032 is used in all\nshower distributions generically expressed as S in Sec.
