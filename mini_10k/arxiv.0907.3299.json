In spite of the impossibility to assign this angular\nmomentum to any one of these particles, it has inspired Goldhaber1 and others 2,3\nto interpret the value \u2212Q quantized by Eq.

Thus, he has avoided the use of any strings\nof Eq. (1). The spin quantization condition (17) is equivalent to (16) making these\nstrings invisible. However, instead of the string potentials of Eq. (1), he has arrived\nto the non-Abelian spin-potential3,4 As (x) given by Eq. (19), which also obeys\nEq.

A single spin\nis enoug1 to obtain Dirac's strings A\u00b1\nu (x) only. To reproduce Schwinger's string\nAu (x) of Eq. (11) it is necessary to take the operator S as a sum of two mutually\ncommutative spin operators3, S = Sa + Sb . The final result is reached by using the\nunitary transformation3: U = Ua\u22121 (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u2212\u03b1)Ub\u22121 (\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2212\u03c0, \u2212\u03b1) (clf. Eq.

This qualitatively makes\nvery smooth a physical difference between two types of these strings, because by\nusing a gauge-like transformation (12) an arbitrary position of (Schwinger's) string\nalways can be directed almost along the vector n of incident charge without violating\n\"Dirac's veto\"3 .\nThe aim of the present letter is to show that the above one-particle interpretation of the total angular momentum operator can be replaced naturally by its\ninterpretation for some extended object leading to disappearance of Schwinger's\nstring.\n2.

Conclusion\nThe inability to assign irremovable additional angular momentum (17) of common\ncharge-monopole EMF to any one of these particles indicates incompleteness of\nsingle-particle interpretation9 of the rotation symmetry for this system and lack\nof single-particle interpretation for the total angular momentum operator and its\neigenfunctions. We showed that Schwinger's symmetric vector potential6 (1), (11)\ndirectly leads to the more natural interpretation of the rotation symmetry for this\nsystem, as a symmetry of extended object with the properties of a symmetric quantum top with the infinite moment of inertia about the third principal axis of inertia.\nThe whole system behaves with respect to rotations similarly to diatomic molecule\nwith taking into account the total angular momentum of its electronic shell.
