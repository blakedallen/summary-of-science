It is shown that quenched bulk charge disorder gives rise to an\nadditive contribution to the net interaction force which decays as the inverse distance between the\nslabs and may thus completely mask the standard Casimir\u2013van der Waals force at large separations.\nBy contrast, annealed (bulk or surface) charge disorder leads to a net interaction force whose largedistance behavior coincides with the universal Casimir force between perfect conductors, which\nscales as inverse cubic distance, and the dielectric properties enter only in subleading corrections.\nPACS numbers: 05.40.-a, 03.50.De, 34.20.Gj\n\nRecent ultrahigh sensitivity experiments on Casimir\n(zero temperature and ideally polarizable surfaces) and\nvan der Waals (finite temperature and non-ideally polarizable surfaces) interactions between surfaces in vacuo\n[1, 2] have highlighted the need for an accurate assessment of the possible electrostatic contribution to the total interaction when the surfaces bear a disordered charge\ndistribution [3]. The surface charge distribution can have\nvarious origins. In the so-called patch effect, the variation of the local crystallographic axes of the exposed\nsurface of a clean polycrystalline sample can lead to a\nvariation of the local surface potential [4]. These variations are of course sample specific and depend heavily on\nthe method of preparation of the samples. The electrostatic forces due to this surface potential disorder cannot\nbe eliminated by grounding the two interacting surfaces.\nA similar type of surface charge disorder can also be expected for amorphous films deposited on crystalline substrates. Surface annealing of these films can produce a\ngrain structure of an extent that can be larger than the\nthickness of the deposited surface film [5]. In addition,\nadsorption of various contaminants can also influence the\nnature and type of the surface charge disorder.\nHere we assess the effect of various types of monopolar\ncharge disorder on the interaction between two macroscopic surfaces, delimiting two semi-infinite net-neutral\ndielectric slabs, separated by a layer of vacuum or an\narbitrary dielectric material (Fig. 1). Since the nature\nand distribution of the charge disorder in any of the experiments is in general not known, we consider different\na priori models for the distribution of disorder. Specifically, we assume that the charge disorder originates from\nrandomly distributed monopolar charges which may be\n\npresent both in the bulk and on the bounding surfaces\nand can be either annealed or quenched. It turns out\nthat the type and the nature of the disorder has important consequences for the total interaction between\napposed bodies and can even dominate or give a contribution comparable to the underlying Casimir\u2013van der\nWaals (vdW) effect. Our main goal is thus to investigate the interaction fingerprint of the charge disorder\nand to compare its contribution to the total interaction with the zero-frequency Casimir\u2013vdW interaction\nbetween macroscopic surfaces. This may in turn help\nin assessing whether the experimentally observed interactions can be interpreted in terms of disorder-induced\neffects or pure Casimir\u2013vdW interactions.\nWe consider two semi-infinite slabs of dielectric con-\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) A typical experimental set up (bottom)\nis modeled with a plane-parallel system (top) of two dielectric\nslabs (half-spaces) of dielectric constant \u03b5p interacting across\na medium of dielectric constant \u03b5m . The charge distribution\nin the bulk of the slabs and on the two bounding surfaces at\nz = \u00b1D/2 has a disordered component (shown schematically\nby small light and dark patches) with zero mean but finite\nvariance, and may be either quenched or annealed in nature.\n\n\f2\nstant \u03b5p and temperature T with parallel planar inner\nsurfaces (of infinite area S) located normal to the z axis\nat z = \u00b1D/2, where D is thus the distance between their\nsurfaces (see Fig. 1). The inner gap is filled with a material of dielectric constant \u03b5m . We shall assume that\nthe dielectric slabs have a disordered monopolar charge\ndistribution, \u03c1(r), which may arise from charges residing\non bounding surfaces [\u03c1s (r)] and/or in the bulk [\u03c1b (r)],\ni.e. \u03c1(r) = \u03c1s (r) + \u03c1b (r). The charge disorder will be\ntaken to be of zero mean (i.e., the slabs are net neutral)\nand Gaussian-distributed [6] with no correlation in space\ni.e., hh\u03c1(r)\u03c1(r0 )ii = g(r)\u03b4(r\u2212r0 ) [where hh* * * ii denotes the\ndisorder average]. The total correlation is the sum of the\nsurface and bulk correlations g(r) = gs (r) + gb (r). For\nthe slab geometry considered here, the charge distribution is assumed to be statistically invariant in the plane\nof the dielectrics but with a variance dependent on z as\ngs (r) = gs e20 [\u03b4(z + D/2) + \u03b4(z \u2212 D/2)],\n\u001a\ngb e20 |z| > D/2,\ngb (r) =\n0\n|z| < D/2,\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nwhere e0 is the elementary charge. It is worth mentioning how this sort of disorder distribution might arise. If\nthe bulk material has charge impurities at the sites ri\ndistributed uniformly and independently with density nb\nand charges qi = \u00b1qP\nb e0 with equal probability, then we\nclearly have \u03c1b (r) = i qi \u03b4(r \u2212 ri ) and find hh\u03c1b (r)ii = 0\nand hh\u03c1b (r)\u03c1b (r)ii = qb2 e20 nb \u03b4(r \u2212 r0 ). We can thus make\nthe correspondence gb = qb2 nb . Similarly, one can make\nthe correspondence gs = qs2 ns with ns being the surface\ndensity of impurity charges \u00b1qs on bounding surfaces.\nThe partition function for the classical Casimir\u2013vdW\ninteraction (the zero-frequency Matsubara modes of the\nelectromagnetic field) may be written as a functional integral over the scalar field \u03c6(r),\nZ\nZ[\u03c1(r)] = [D\u03c6(r)] e\u2212\u03b2S[\u03c6(r);\u03c1(r)] ,\n(3)\nwith \u03b2 = 1/kB T and the effective action\nZ\n\u0003\n\u0002\nS[\u03c6(r); \u03c1(r)] = dr 21 \u03b50 \u03b5(r) (\u2207\u03c6(r))2 +i \u03c1(r)\u03c6(r) , (4)\nwhere \u03b5(r) = \u03b5p for |z| > D/2 and \u03b5m otherwise. In order\nto evaluate the averaged quantities such as the effective\ninteraction, one needs to average the partition function\nover different realizations of the disordered charge distribution, \u03c1(r) [7]. It is thus important to distinguish\nbetween quenched and annealed disorder that involve different averaging schemes. For quenched disorder, the\ndisorder charges are frozen and cannot fluctuate; for annealed disorder the charges can fluctuate and, in particular, the charge distribution in the two slabs can adapt\nitself to minimize the free energy of the system. These\ntwo different disorder types lead to very different physical\nbehaviors as will be demonstrated below.\n\nLet us first consider the quenched disorder model,\nwhere one must take the disorder average over the sample\nfree energy, ln Z[\u03c1(r)], in order to calculate the averaged\nquantities. The free energy of the quenched system,\n\u03b2Fquenched = \u2212hhln Z[\u03c1(r)]ii,\n\n(5)\n\nmay be calculated from Eq. (3) as\n\u03b2Fquenched =\n\n\u03b2 \b\n1\nTr ln G\u22121 (r, r0 )+ Tr g(r)G(r, r0 ) , (6)\n2\n2\n\nwhere G(r, r0 ) is the Green's function defined via\n\u03b50 \u2207 * [\u03b5(r)\u2207G(r, r0 )] = \u2212\u03b4(r \u2212 r0 ).\n\n(7)\n\nIn the first term of Eq.\n(6), we recognize\nthe\nstandard\nzero-frequency\nvdW\ninteraction\nThe second term,\n\u03b2FvdW \u2261 21 Tr ln G\u22121 (r, r0 ).\n\u03b2Fg \u2261 \u03b22 Tr{g(r)G(r, r0 )}, represents the contribution of the quenched charge disorder, which turns out to\nbe additive in the free energy.\nThe quenched expression (6) is valid for any arbitrary\ndisorder variance g(r).

The quenched contribution from the bulk\ndisorder (first term) in Eq. (10) is in principle infra-red\ndivergent, however the corresponding force is finite. The\ntotal force, fquenched = \u2212\u2202Fquenched /\u2202D, thus follows as\n\u0012\n\u0013\ngb lB \u2206\n2gs lB \u03b5m | ln(1 \u2212 \u22062 )| 1 Li3 (\u22062 )\n\u03b2fquenched\n=\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n.\nS\n2\u03b5p D\n(\u03b5m + \u03b5p )2 \u2206\nD2\n8\u03c0D3\n(11)\nHere we obtain a sequence of scaling behaviors of different origins: a leading 1/D term due to the quenched bulk\ndisorder, a subleading 1/D2 term from the surface charge\ndisorder, and the pure vdW term that goes as 1/D3 and\nprevails in the absence of charge disorder.

Annealed curves stay close to one another and are bracketed by the perfect conductor result (Eq.\n(20), top solid line, labeled by \u03b6(3)) for large disorder and the vdW result for no disorder (Eq.

(b) and (c) are plotted in log-log scale.\n\ncontributions (first and second terms in Eq. (11)) are\nattractive when the dielectric mismatch \u2206 > 0 (e.g., for\ntwo dielectrics slabs in vacuum) and repulsive otherwise\n(e.g., for the two surfaces of a single slab in vacuum). One\nmight expect that globally electroneutral slabs would exhibit a dipolar-like interaction force on the leading order rather than the monopolar forms 1/D (or 1/D2 ) obtained for the bulk (or surface) charge distribution. The\nphysics involved is indeed subtle as the disorder terms\nresult from the self-interaction of the charges with their\nimages (which follows from G(r, r), Eq. (6), and only\nin a dielectrically inhomogeneous system) and not from\ndipolar interactions (which come from an expansion of\nG(r, r0 ) when |r\u2212r0 | is large). Statistically speaking each\ncharge on average (as any other charge has an equal probability of being of the same or opposite sign) only sees\nits image, thus explaining the leading monopolar form in\nthe net force.\nThe remarkable result is however the relative importance of the disorder-induced forces, which exhibit a\nmuch weaker decay with the separation, D. They may\nthus completely mask the standard Casimir\u2013vdW force at\nsufficiently large separations depending on the dielectric\nconstants and the disorder variances as shown in Figs. 2a\nand 2b; the bulk disorder variance is chosen here within\nthe typical range gb ' 10\u221211 \u221210\u22126 nm\u22123 (corresponding\nto impurity charge densities of 1010 \u2212 1015 e0 /cm3 ) [8].\nFor relatively small surface disorder (gs \u001c gb lB ), the\nanomalous 1/D behavior is predicted to dominate the\nvdW 1/D3 behavior beyond the crossover distance\n\u03b5p Li3 (\u22062 )\nDb =\n4\u03c0gb lB \u2206\n\u0014\n\n\u00151/2\n,\n\n(12)\n\nwhich, for typical parameter values, covers the experimentally relevant range of distances from a few hundreds\nof nm to several microns (Fig. 2b, main set). For strong\nsurface disorder (gs \u001d gb lB ), on the other hand, one expects the 1/D2 behavior to dominate beyond\nDs =\n\n(\u03b5m + \u03b5p )2 \u2206 Li3 (\u22062 )\n.\n16\u03c0gs lB \u03b5m | ln(1 \u2212 \u22062 )|\n\n(13)\n\nSo far we have only examined the effects from the\nquenched disorder. In reality one may encounter disordered charges with some degree of annealing. A possible\nidealization is to assume that the disorder is completely\nannealed (the intermediate partially annealed cases are\nalso analytically tractable as shown recently [9] but will\nnot be considered here). In the annealed disorder model,\nthe disorder average is taken over the sample partition\nfunction, Z[\u03c1(r)]; hence, the free energy of the system,\n\u03b2Fannealed = \u2212 ln hhZ[\u03c1(r)]ii,\n\n(14)\n\nmay be evaluated as\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\nTr ln G\u22121 (r, r0 ) + \u03b2g(r)\u03b4(r \u2212 r0 ) . (15)\n2\nNote that, unlike the quenched result in Eq. (6), the\ndisorder and the pure Casimir\u2013vdW contributions can\nnot be separated in general when the disorder is annealed.\nIn the case of two interacting slabs with the surface\nand bulk disorder variances (1) and (2), the modified\ninverse Green's function G\u22121 (r, r0 )+\u03b2g(r)\u03b4(r\u2212r0 ) may be\nevaluated explicitly and the fluctuational trace-log term\nmay be calculated by the standard methods [10] as\nZ\n\u0001\n1\nd2 Q\n\u03b2Fannealed\n(16)\n=\nln 1 \u2212 \u22062g (Q) e\u22122QD\nS\n2\n(2\u03c0)2\n\u03b2Fannealed =\n\n\f4\nwith\np\n\u03b5m Q \u2212 \u03b5p Q2 + 4\u03c0lB gb /\u03b5p \u2212 4\u03c0lB gs\np\n.\n\u2206g (Q) =\n\u03b5m Q + \u03b5p Q2 + 4\u03c0lB gb /\u03b5p + 4\u03c0lB gs\n\n(17)\n\nLet us first consider the large-distance behavior of the\nnet annealed force. For strong annealed bulk disorder\n(gs \u001c gb lB ), we obtain the asymptotic behavior\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3\u03b6(3)\u03b5m\n\u03b6(3)\n1\n\u03b2fannealed\np\n+\n,\n(18)\n'\u2212\nS\n8\u03c0D3\n64\u03c0 3 gb lB \u03b5p D4\np\nwhich is expected to hold for D \u001d 3\u03b5m / \u03c0gb lB \u03b5p [i.e.,\nD \u001d 70 nm for gb = 10\u22126 nm\u22123 and \u03b5p = 10 in vacuum].\nWhile for weak bulk disorder (gs \u001d gb lB ), we obtain\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3\u03b6(3)\u03b5m 1\n\u03b6(3)\n\u03b2fannealed\n+\n,\n(19)\n'\u2212\nS\n8\u03c0D3\n16\u03c0 2 gs lB D4\nwhich is expected to hold for D \u001d 3\u03b5m /(2\u03c0gs lB ) [i.e.,\nD \u001d 80 nm for gs = 10\u22124 nm\u22122 in vacuum]. Obviously, material properties disappear in the leading-order\ntotal force between arbitrary dielectrics bearing annealed\ncharge disorder and one ends up with the universal attraction as one would expect for two perfect conductors\n\u03b2fannealed\n\u03b6(3)\n=\u2212\nS\n8\u03c0D3\n\nD \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(20)\n\nThese asymptotic behaviors are also obtained for strong\ndisorder (gb or gs \u2192 \u221e). On the contrary, for weak disorder (gb and gs \u2192 0) or for vanishing separation, one recovers the non-universal vdW force (9) as the asymptotic\nbehavior. It is thus interesting to note that the force in\nthe annealed case is bounded between these two limiting\nresults, i.e. Eqs. (9) and (20) (Fig. 2c, solid lines). The\nabove results demonstrate the intuitive fact that dielectric slabs with annealed charges tend to behave asymptotically as perfect conductors and, unlike the quenched\ncase, the algebraic decay of the leading contribution to\nthe net force remains unchanged. The deviations due to\nmaterial properties and the disorder variance contribute\na repulsive subleading force (Eqs. (18) and (19)).\nFor the experimental sphere-plane geometry [2] a naive\napplication of the proximity force approximation [1] to\nthe results derived above would lead to forces with the\nleading behavior \u223c ln D + O(D\u22121 ) in the quenched case\n(from Eq. (11)) and \u223c D\u22122 + O(D\u22123 ) in the annealed\ncase (from Eqs. (18) and (19)). Thus, an effective\nscaling exponent (defined as D\u2212\u03b1 ) of \u03b1 \u2264 1 (consistent with recent experimental observation of a residual electrostatic force scaling as D\u22120.8 [11]) may be obtained in the quenched case, both with the bulk disorder\n(plane-plane and sphere-plane geometry) and the surface disorder model (sphere-plane geometry). A more\ndetailed comparison with force measurements should be\nattempted once the experimental and methodological uncertainties surrounding experiments are sorted out (see\nRef. [2] and published comments).\n\nIn conclusion, we have studied the influence of charge\ndisorder on the fluctuation-induced interaction between\nnet-neutral dielectric slabs bearing random quenched\nand/or annealed monopolar charges on their bounding\nsurfaces and/or in the bulk and compared it with the\nzero-frequency Casimir\u2013vdW interaction between them.\nQuenched disorder leads to an additive contribution to\nthe total interaction force that scales as 1/D (or 1/D2 )\nfor bulk (or surface) charge disorder, may be attractive or\nrepulsive and depends on the dielectric constants of the\nmaterials. By contrast, annealed disorder leads to a net\nattractive force, which is universal and decays as 1/D3\nat large separations. Thus, the main fingerprint of the\nannealed disorder is that the total force remains intact\nin this case as the dielectric constants are varied. This\ncould help distinguish this type of interaction from the\npure Casimir-vdW interaction between dielectrics with\nno disorder as well as from the interaction due to the\nquenched disorder, Eq. (11). These two latter cases can\nin turn be distinguished by monitoring the dependence\non the separation of the net interaction, which for the\nquenched disorder exhibits a much weaker decay. Note\nthat the disorder effects are compared here with the zerofrequency Casimir-vdW interaction. The precise correction presented by the higher-order Matsubara frequencies\nis very material specific, but its magnitude (relative to\nthe zero-frequency term) is typically small for the most\npart of the separation range considered here and remains\nnegligible in comparison with the quenched terms in (11).\nWe thank M.
