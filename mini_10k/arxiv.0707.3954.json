Introduction\nA well-known problem of supersymmetry (SUSY) at the electroweak (EW) scale is its\nproliferation of parameters, arising if one keeps the most general allowed terms in the soft\nsector. In absence of the latter, SUSY is not phenomenologically viable, while in presence\nof a most general soft sector, SUSY largely loses its predictivity, due to the bulkiness of\nthe parameter space.\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fSince SUSY goes often together with the idea of Grand Unification, due to the tantalizing observation of gauge coupling unification after MSSM running, a sensible way-out to\nthe above problem is to take a 'top-down' approach. In this case one starts with the theory\nat the GUT scale \u2013 with a far simpler parameter space than the MSSM one \u2013 and runs\nall the parameters downwards through Renormalization Group Equations (RGEs). The\nlatter then dynamically generate all the mass splittings for the soft terms at the EW scale,\nwhich, in the low-energy MSSM without GUT, are treated instead as free parameters.\nAs an argument in favour of a top-down approach to the MSSM, it can be noted that\npredictive SUSY GUT models need typically two ingredients at the GUT scale. The first\none is the choice of a specific GUT gauge symmetry. Second, one has to fix the high-scale\nsoft sector with minimal assumptions on the parametric dependence, which seems justified\ndue to a higher amount of symmetry of the theory at this high scale. A further restriction\non the number of parameters and hence more predictability of the model can be obtained\nby introducing additional family symmetries. Once these different parts of the model are\nspecified, the theoretical and computational tools available today allow for a very controlled\ntheoretical error on the model parameters at low-energy, in spite of the 'long running' from\nthe GUT scale and the presence of mass thresholds.\nConcerning SUSY GUT models present on the market, while it is easy to construct\nmodels reproducing the gauge sector of the MSSM at low-energy, it is far more challenging\nto find models also correctly describing 'flavour patterns' such as quark and lepton masses\nand the CKM and PMNS matrices.\nOne such notable model has been proposed by Derm\u0131\u0301\u0161ek and Raby in [1]. It is an\nSO(10) SUSY GUT, augmented with a simple family symmetry, conserving R-parity at\nlow-energy. As shown in [1], this model is able to successfully fit all the parameters of the\nSM. In particular, by using some observables basically unaffected by SUSY contributions,\nit can reproduce the CKM matrix entries. Finally, it also describes the known parameters\nin the neutrino sector. In Ref. [2], the same model was also extensively studied in the\nlepton flavour sector, thereby providing a number of signatures of the model, which should\nat least in part be tested by forthcoming experiments.\nIn view of the above mentioned remarkable performance of the DR model in describing\nlow-energy observables, it is interesting to have a closer look at its SUSY spectrum, with\nthe aim of testing, e.g., the predicted mass hierarchies. Since SUSY particles have not yet\nbeen observed, such task can only be accomplished by analyzing implied loop effects in\nflavour changing neutral current (FCNC) processes. In fact, the specific mass patterns of\ngauginos, up- and down-squarks and Higgs multiplets predicted by the model, do affect\nmeasured quark FCNC observables in a peculiar way, and if such observables are well\ncontrolled, the pattern of implied corrections is testable. Fortunately, we have today a\nwhole host of such observables, which have the virtue of being at the same time precisely\nmeasured and accurately calculated within the MSSM.\nThe aim of the present paper is then an in-depth test of the model in the light of all\nthe most accurate information presently available on quark FCNCs. The flavour sector\nis often overlooked in first analyses of new physics (NP) models, due to its vastness and\nthe necessity of sometimes involved calculations. In the context of the present model, we\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fshow that the flavour sector has nonetheless enough sensitivity to the details of the SUSY\nspectrum, to represent a discriminating test for the model itself.\nOur paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we give a brief overview of the DR\nmodel, focusing on those ingredients that are most relevant for our purposes. In Section 3\nwe then outline the procedure to connect the GUT scale model with low-energy observables.\nSuch procedure is well-known, but often obscured by the assumptions made on the running\nand the mass thresholds. Section 4 goes then in more detail on the determination of masses\nand couplings, through consideration of low-energy threshold effects. In Section 5 we then\npresent the collection of FCNC observables we use for the purpose of our paper. The\nemphasis here is on presenting simplified expressions, in order to provide an intuitive picture\nof the main effects, with refined formulae only used in the actual numerical analysis. In\nthe light of such intuitive expressions, Section 6 then discusses the general pattern featured\nby the corresponding FCNC observables within the DR model. An extensive analysis of\nall such features upon variation of the DR model parameters is then presented in Section\n7. Finally, Section 8 is devoted to our conclusions.\n\n2. The model\nThe DR model [1, 3] is a supersymmetric SO(10) Grand Unified Theory with an additional\nD3 \u00d7 [U (1) \u00d7 Z2 \u00d7 Z3 ] family symmetry.\nThe above symmetry group fixes the following structure for the superpotential\nW = Wf + W\u03bd ,\nwith\nWf = 163 10 163 + 16a 10 \u03c7a\n+ \u03c7\u0304a (M\u03c7 \u03c7a + 45\n\n\u03c6a\n\n\u03c6\u0303a\n\n16a + A 16a ) ,\nM\u0302\n1\nW\u03bd = 16(\u03bb2 Na 16a + \u03bb3 N3 163 ) + (Sa Na Na + S3 N3 N3 ) .\n2\nM\u0302\n\n163 + 45\n\n(2.1)\n(2.2)\n\nThe first two families of quarks and leptons are contained in the superfield 16a , a =\n1, 2, which transforms under SO(10)\u00d7D3 as (16, 2A ), whereas the third family in 163\ntransforms as (16, 1B ). The two MSSM Higgs doublets Hu and Hd are contained in a\n10. As can be seen from the first term on the right-hand side of (2.1), Yukawa unification\n\u03bbt = \u03bbb = \u03bb\u03c4 = \u03bb\u03bd\u03c4 at MG is obtained only for the third generation, which is directly\ncoupled to the Higgs 10 representation. This immediately implies large tan \u03b2 \u2248 50 at low\nenergies.\nThe effective Yukawa couplings of the first and second generation fermions are instead\ngenerated via the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism [4] as follows. Additional fields are introduced, i.e. the 45 which is an adjoint of SO(10), the SO(10) singlet flavon fields \u03c6a , \u03c6 \u0303a , A\nand the Froggatt-Nielsen states \u03c7a , \u03c7\u0304a . The latter transform as a (16, 2A ) and a (16, 2A ),\nrespectively, and receive masses of O(MG ) as M\u03c7 acquires an SO(10) breaking VEV. Once\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fthey are integrated out, they give rise to effective mass operators which, together with the\nVEVs of the flavon fields, create the Yukawa couplings for the first two generations. This\nmechanism breaks systematically the full flavour symmetry and produces the right mass\nhierarchies among the fermions.\nThe obtained Yukawa matrices for up-quarks, down-quarks, charged leptons and neutrinos are\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 \u03b5\u2032 \u03c1 \u2212\u03b5 \u03be\n0 \u03b5\u2032 \u2212\u03b5 \u03be \u03c3\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nYu = \uf8ed \u2212\u03b5\u2032 \u03c1 \u03b5\u0303 \u03c1 \u2212\u03b5 \uf8f8 \u03bb ,\nYd = \uf8ed \u2212\u03b5\u2032 \u03b5\u0303 \u2212\u03b5 \u03c3 \uf8f8 \u03bb ,\n\u03b5\u03be \u03b5\n1\n\u03b5\u03be \u03b5\n1\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0\n\u2212\u03b5\u2032 3 \u03b5 \u03be\n0\n\u2212\u03b5\u2032 \u03c9 23 \u03b5 \u03be \u03c9\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n(2.3)\nYe = \uf8ed \u03b5\u2032\n3 \u03b5\u0303 \u03c9 32 \u03b5 \u03c9 \uf8f8 \u03bb .\n3 \u03b5\u0303 3 \u03b5 \uf8f8 \u03bb , Y\u03bd = \uf8ed \u03b5\u2032 \u03c9\n\u22123 \u03b5 \u03be \u03c3 \u22123 \u03b5 \u03c3\n1\n\u22123 \u03b5 \u03be \u03c3 \u22123 \u03b5 \u03c3 1\n\nFrom eqs. (2.3) one can see that the flavour hierarchies in the Yukawa couplings are encoded\nin terms of the four complex parameters \u03c1, \u03c3, \u03b5\u0303, \u03be and the additional real ones \u03b5, \u03b5\u2032 , \u03bb.\nIn order to avoid neutrino masses of the order of the other fermion masses, one invokes\nthe type-I see-saw mechanism [5, 6, 7, 8]. In particular, three SO(10) singlet Majorana fermion fields Na , N3 (a = 1, 2) are introduced via the contribution of 21 (Sa Na Na + S3 N3 N3 )\nto the superpotential.\nThe mass term 21 N MN N is produced when the flavon fields acquire VEVs hSa i = MNa\nand hS3 i = MN3 . Together with a 16 Higgs one is allowed to introduce the interaction\nterms 16 (\u03bb2 Na 16a + \u03bb3 N3 163 ), which in turn generate a mixing matrix V between the\nright-handed neutrinos and the additional singlets (\u03bd V N ), when the 16 acquires an SO(10)\nbreaking VEV h16i\u03bd = v16 . The resulting effective right-handed neutrino mass terms read\nWN = \u03bd V N +\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n0 \u03bb2 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nV = v16 \uf8ed \u03bb2 0 0 \uf8f8 ,\n0 0 \u03bb3\n\n1\nN MN N ,\n2\n\nMN = diag(MN1 , MN2 , MN3 ) .\n\n(2.4)\n\n(2.5)\n\nDiagonalization leads to the effective right-handed neutrino Majorana mass\n\u22121 T\nV \u2261 \u2212diag(MR1 , MR2 , MR3 ) .\nMR = \u2212V MN\n\n(2.6)\n\nBy integrating out the EW singlets \u03bd and N , which both receive GUT scale masses, one\nends up with the light neutrino mass matrix at the EW scale given by the usual see-saw\nformula\nM = m\u03bd MR\u22121 mT\u03bd .\n\n(2.7)\n\n3. Basic procedure\nIn this section, we describe the procedure which, from the specification of the model at the\nGUT scale, leads to the MSSM mass spectrum and observables at the EW scale.\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\f3.1 Step 1: Parameters of the model\nGauge coupling sector\nWe choose as three parameters the unification scale MG , the gauge coupling \u03b1G defined\nthrough\n\u03b1G \u2261 \u03b11 (MG ) = \u03b12 (MG ) ,\n\n(3.1)\n\nand the threshold correction \u01eb3 defined through\n\u03b13 (MG ) = \u03b1G (1 + \u01eb3 ) .\n\n(3.2)\n\nThe threshold correction \u01eb3 helps to obtain the right value of \u03b13 (MZ ).\nSUSY sector\nWe have the following set of soft SUSY breaking parameters: a universal sfermion mass\nm16 , a universal gaugino mass M1/2 , a universal trilinear coupling parameter A0 , and the\nHiggs mass parameters mHu and mHd . It is well-known that at large tan \u03b2, EWSB is easier\nto achieve by allowing the soft SUSY breaking Higgs mass parameters to be split. This\nalso has the consequence that the absolute value of \u03bc is not fixed by EWSB, as is the case\nin the CMSSM1 , but is instead a free parameter.\nYukawa matrices\nThe Yukawa matrices for up- and down-type quarks, charged leptons and neutrinos are\nparameterized as given in (2.3), with \u03b5, \u03b5\u2032 , \u03bb being real and \u03c1, \u03c3, \u03b5\u0303, \u03be complex parameters.\nRight-handed neutrinos\nThe diagonal right-handed neutrino mass matrix is chosen to be real, which amounts to\nthree parameters MRi , with i = 1, 2, 3.\nWeak-scale parameters\nIn addition to the above GUT-scale parameters, the SUSY parameters \u03bc and tan \u03b2 have\nalso to be specified as an input at the weak scale.\nThe total number of input parameters, listed in this step and summarized in Table 1,\nis therefore 24. Once these parameters are fixed, the MSSM couplings as well as its whole\nmass spectrum (which includes the SM part) can be predicted at energies below MG , in\nparticular at MZ or any lower scale relevant for FCNC processes. Of course a subset of\nthe observables amenable to prediction is used to fix the model parameters.\nThe procedure to fix the above parameters will be addressed in detail in Section 7.\nSuch procedure uses low-energy observables, and for this reason we need to evolve the\nfundamental parameters of the theory to MZ or below, using their RGEs. The evolution\nto low energy is performed according to a procedure we will now describe.\n1\n\nVery interesting combined analyses in the framework of the CMSSM have been performed in [9, 10, 11].\nIn [12], also non-universal Higgs masses were considered, but only with vanishing A0 .\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fSector\n\n#\n\nParameters\n\ngauge\nSUSY (GUT scale)\ntextures\nneutrino\nSUSY (EW scale)\n\n3\n5\n11\n3\n2\n\n\u03b1G , MG , \u01eb3 ,\nm16 , M1/2 , A0 , mHu , mHd ,\n\u01eb, \u01eb\u2032 , \u03bb, \u03c1, \u03c3, \u01eb\u0303, \u03be,\nMR1 , MR2 , MR3 ,\ntan \u03b2, \u03bc\n\nTable 1: Parameters in the DR model.\n\n3.2 Step 2: RG evolution\nMGUT > scale > MRi\nThe RGEs of the MSSM with right-handed neutrinos [13, 14, 15] are used to run the gauge\ncouplings, Yukawa couplings, all soft SUSY breaking parameters and the right-handed\nneutrino mass matrix MR down to the mass of the heaviest right-handed neutrino. At\nthis threshold, one must rediagonalize MR and integrate out one neutrino following [16].\nThis generates the effective dimension-five neutrino mass operator. The two remaining\nthresholds are treated accordingly, with the number of neutrinos reduced by one each\ntime. In practical calculations, this procedure turns out to be computationally demanding.\nWe have thus followed the approach of integrating out all the right-handed neutrinos at a\nsingle intermediate threshold, corresponding to the mass of the lightest of them. We have\nthen checked that this approximate treatment does not have any relevant impact on either\nthe determination of the GUT-scale parameters or the low-energy predictions of the model.\nMRi > scale > MZ\nHaving constructed the effective theory without right-handed neutrinos at the scale where\nthey are integrated out, we use MSSM RGEs [17] to run the gauge couplings, Yukawa\nmatrices, soft SUSY breaking parameters and the Wilson coefficient of the neutrino mass\noperator down to the scale MZ . We use two-loop RGEs for dimensionless and one-loop for\ndimensionful parameters.\nSo, starting from the fundamental parameters of Step 1, and performing RGE evolution\nthrough Step 2, one has now the whole set of parameters of the MSSM fixed at MZ or\nbelow, to tree-level. However, for many quantities, such as gauge couplings, some SUSY\nmasses, quark masses, CKM matrix and the Higgs sector, a one-loop determination turns\nout to be mandatory, for different reasons. These issues will be discussed in the next\nsection.\nHere we would like to stress a further property of the low-scale MSSM parameters\nimplied by the DR model. The off-diagonal entries in the squark mass matrices are generated radiatively by the Yukawa couplings; in addition the quark sector features only one\nCP phase2 . These two facts allow to classify the low-energy MSSM resulting from the\n2\n\nPutting additional phases in the right-handed neutrino mass matrix would communicate corresponding\nphases to the low-energy neutrino sector, without affecting, to a very good approximation, the quark sector.\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fRG evolution of the DR model as belonging to the class of models with minimal flavour\nviolation (MFV) [18].\nWith the above qualifications, using the numerically determined parameters of the\ntheory, we can then evaluate effective Hamiltonians for weak decays, in particular for FCNC\nand CP-violating processes. Having these Hamiltonians at hand, it is straightforward to\nevaluate the branching ratios for various low energy processes and to compare them with\nexperiments. The latter strategy, allowing to extensively test the model in the flavour\nsector, will be dealt with in Sections 6 and 7.\n\n4. One-loop improved determination of low-energy observables\nWith low-energy observables we denote all the physical quantities that can be directly\naccessed experimentally and compared with predictions of the model. Among these quantities, some will be used to fix the model parameters, through a fitting procedure, as\ndescribed in Section 7. The others will then be genuine predictions of the model.\nTo obtain all physical observables beyond tree-level accuracy at the scale MZ , one needs\nto include one-loop corrections in the relevant formulae defining the observables themselves.\nThe inclusion of such corrections is also advocated in the analyses [1, 2]. Below, we give\nsome details of the procedure in the various cases.\nSUSY masses\nThe mass eigenstates for squarks, sleptons, charginos and neutralinos are calculated at the\nweak scale from the tree-level mass matrices [19]. The gluino pole mass is calculated at\nthe one-loop level.\nGauge sector\nWe calculate the gauge couplings \u03b1s (MZ ) and \u03b1em by including the threshold corrections\ngiven in [20]. We use tadpole corrections to the Higgs potential [20, 21] to obtain the\none-loop VEV and include one-loop SUSY corrections to the Fermi constant measured in\nmuon decay, G\u03bc , as well as to the W and Z boson pole masses [21].\nHiggs spectrum\nThe Higgs spectrum is represented by the masses Mh0 , MH0 , MH + , MA of the corresponding\nphysical particles. In this model H0 , H + and A are typically nearly degenerate, with only\nthe lightest Higgs mass Mh0 lying at a substantially lower value. The scale of the masses\nMH0 , MH + , MA is set in a non-trivial way by the interplay among \u03bc, tan \u03b2, mHu,d and m16\nin the equations minimizing the Higgs potential.\nWe calculate the pseudoscalar Higgs pole mass MA following [20] and use it as an\ninput to FeynHiggs 2.5.1 [22, 23, 24, 25], which accurately calculates the masses of the\nremaining Higgs mass eigenstates, using Yukawa matrices and soft terms at the EW scale,\nwhich in turn are the result of the RG analysis.\nWe explicitly note that MA (and with it the other heavy Higgs masses) is typically\n'pushed up' by the upper bound on the BR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ), so that the MA value obtained\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fwith any given choice of the rest of the parameters can be considered as a lower mass bound\non the heavy Higgs spectrum.\nFermion masses and CKM matrix\nAt large tan \u03b2, quark masses undergo tan \u03b2 enhanced corrections that have to be included\nto the tree-level determination, represented by the running Yukawa couplings at MZ [26].\nThese corrections also modify the relations between the original CKM matrix appearing\nin the MSSM Feynman rules and the effective CKM matrix measured in tree-level decays\n[27, 28]. We closely follow the line of argument of [28] and calculate the one-loop threshold\ncorrections to quark and charged lepton mass matrices at MZ , but take into account both\nSUSY and electroweak contributions. After applying the threshold corrections, we use\nthree-loop QCD and one-loop QED RGEs to run the five light quark and three charged\nlepton masses down to their respective scales.\nThe neutrino masses and the PMNS mixing matrix, on the other hand, are left at the\ntree-level. In fact we find the threshold corrections to these quantities, discussed in [29],\nto be numerically negligible.\n\n5. Basic formulae for FC observables\nIn this section we collect formulae for various branching ratios that we will use in our\nnumerical analysis. In certain cases we show only the leading contribution for large tan \u03b2,\nin order to provide an intuitive picture of the behaviour. For example, in the case of\nBs,d \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 decays, this corresponds to the contribution of Higgs penguins. In the\nactual numerical analysis we include all the relevant contributions, i.e., besides the SM\none, contributions from charginos, charged Higgses and gluinos. Neutralino contributions\nare generally negligible.\n5.1 Bs,d \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212\nIn the SM, the usual Z-penguin and box diagrams result in strongly suppressed branching\nratios that are sensitive functions of the weak decay constants FBd and FBs . Eliminating\nthis dependence with the help of the well-measured mass differences \u2206Ms,d [30], one finds\n[31]\nBR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 )SM = (3.37 \u00b1 0.31) \u00d7 10\u22129 ,\n+ \u2212\n\n\u221210\n\nBR(Bd \u2192 \u03bc \u03bc )SM = (1.02 \u00b1 0.09) \u00d7 10\n\n(5.1)\n.\n\n(5.2)\n\nThese values should be compared with the present 95% C.L. upper bounds from CDF [32]\nBR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 )exp < 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22127 ,\n\nBR(Bd \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 )exp < 3.0 \u00d7 10\u22128 ,\n\n(5.3)\n\nthat leave still a large room for NP contributions.\nIn the MSSM with large tan \u03b2, the helicity suppression in (5.1) and (5.2) is lifted by\nHiggs-mediated neutral currents [33, 34]. Their contributions can be summarized by the\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fapproximate formula [28, 35]\nBR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) \u2243 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22125\n\u00d7\n\n\"\n\ntan \u03b2\n50\n\n#6 \"\n\n\u03c4Bs\n1.5 ps\n\n#\"\n\nFBs\n230 MeV\n\n#2 \"\n\n(16\u03c0 2 \u01ebY )2\nm4t\n,\nMA4 (1 + \u01eb\u03033 tan \u03b2)2 (1 + \u01eb0 tan \u03b2)2\n\n|Vts |\n0.040\n\n#2\n(5.4)\n\nwhere mt \u2261 mt (\u03bct ) and\n\u01eb\u03033 = \u01eb0 + yt2 \u01ebY ,\n\n(5.5)\n\nwith \u01eb0 and \u01ebY standing for gluino loop and chargino loop factors, whose full expressions\ncan be found in [28].\nWith a similar expression for BR(Bd \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ), one also gets\n\u0014\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0015 \u0014\n\u0015\n\u0015 \u0014\n\u03c4Bd\nFBd 2 |Vtd | 2 MBd 5\nBR(Bd \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 )\n,\n=\nBR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 )\n\u03c4Bs\nFBs\n|Vts |\nMBs\n\n(5.6)\n\nwhere non-leading contributions have been neglected.\nObserving that the ratio (5.6) is roughly a factor of ten smaller than the corresponding\nratio of experimental bounds (5.3), it is clear that, in our framework, the current BR(Bd \u2192\n\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) constraint is completely marginal with respect to the Bs counterpart, which is the\nonly channel considered in the rest of the analysis.\nWe explicitly note that, in eq. (5.4), as throughout the text, Vti denotes elements\nof the physical CKM matrix3 , to be distinguished for large tan \u03b2 from the corresponding\nmatrix appearing at the Lagrangian level. The latter is denoted as 'bare' since it does\nnot yet include the large tan \u03b2-resummed effects. A similar comment applies to the quark\nmasses. In actual numerical calculations, the differences between the physical and the\n'bare' parameters have been taken into proper account as discussed in section 4.\nAt this stage, it suffices to state that \u01eb0 and \u01eb\u03033 are at most O(10\u22122 ). Still, with\ntan \u03b2 \u2248 50, as characteristic for the DR model, the tan \u03b2-resummed corrections in the last\nfactor in (5.4) can be significant and, depending on the sign of \u03bc, can provide an additional\nenhancement of BR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) or respectively some suppression relative to the leading\nbehaviour (tan \u03b2)6 . One finds in the full space of parameters considered\nsign(\u01eb0 ) = sign(\u01eb\u03033 ) = sign(\u03bc)\n\n(5.7)\n\nand more explicitly,\n\n3\n\n2\u03b1s \u03bc\nH2 (m2b\u0303 /m2g\u0303 , m2b\u0303 /m2g\u0303 ) ,\n2\n1\n3\u03c0 mg\u0303\n1 At\n\u2248\nH2 (m2t\u03031 /\u03bc2 , m2t\u03032 /\u03bc2 ) ,\n16\u03c0 2 \u03bc\n\n\u01eb0 \u2248 \u2212\n\n(5.8)\n\n\u01ebY\n\n(5.9)\n\nIn the notation of [28], such matrix elements are written as Vtieff .\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fwhere mb\u0303i (mt\u0303i ) are the masses of the ith sbottom (stop), At is the soft SUSY breaking\nstop trilinear parameter4 and mg\u0303 the gluino mass.

This agrees with the sign convention for A0 in [1, 2] but disagrees with the convention\nused in [19, 28].\n5\nWe mention that gluino and neutralino box contributions were not considered in [28]. In fact, we find\nthese contributions to be very small, but still included them in our numerical analysis. We did not include,\ninstead, subleading effects in the Higgs propagator appearing in DP diagrams. The latter have been recently\naddressed in [38] and play an insignificant role in the present analysis.\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\fWe recall that, experimentally [39],\n(\u2206Ms )exp = (17.77 \u00b1 0.10 \u00b1 0.07)/ps ,\nto be compared with the UTfit and CKMfitter SM predictions [40, 41]\n(\u2206Ms )SM\nUTfit = (18.6 \u00b1 2.3)/ps ,\n\n+5.9\n(\u2206Ms )SM\nCKMfitter = (18.9\u22122.8 )/ps .\n\n(5.14)\n\nThe CKMfitter result still allows for very sizeable NP contributions, while the UTfit\nresult bounds |\u2206Ms |DP to be below \u2248 3/ps provided other NP contributions in (5.12) can be\nneglected. We will see in Section 7 that in the DR model \u2206Ms is slightly suppressed relative\nto the SM, but this suppression amounts to at most 5%, in accordance with experimental\nfindings.\nConcerning \u2206MdDP , it is suppressed by at least two orders of magnitude relative to\n\u2206MsDP due to md /ms and |Vtd |2 /|Vts |2 factors and consequently in the DR model \u2206Md is\nSM-like to a very good accuracy.\nFinally, we note the role played in the present model by the strong correlation [42]\nbetween the Higgs penguin contributions to BR(Bs,d \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) and \u2206Ms : the enhancement\nof BR(Bs,d \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) in the DR model is correlated with a suppression of \u2206Ms . However,\nthe data on \u2206Ms do not allow for very large enhancements of BR(Bs,d \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) so that\nboth observables turn into constraints on the pseudoscalar Higgs mass MA . We will come\nback to this point in Section 6.\n5.3 B \u2192 Xs\u03b3\nAn important constraint on any NP model is the inclusive decay B \u2192 Xs \u03b3 for which the\ndata read [43, 44, 45]\nBR(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3)exp = (3.55 \u00b1 0.24 \u00b1 0.10 \u00b1 0.03) \u00d7 10\u22124 ,\n\n(5.15)\n\nto be compared with the SM value at the NNLO level [46]\nBR(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3)SM = (3.15 \u00b1 0.23) \u00d7 10\u22124 .\n\n(5.16)\n\nThe inclusion of certain non-perturbative effects decreases this value to (2.98 \u00b1 0.26) \u00d7\n[47]. The latter value, if confirmed, would put some tension on the SM prediction.\nIn any case, unless the central experimental value in (5.15) will be significantly decreased,\nNP scenarios predicting BR(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3) to be smaller than the SM value are disfavoured.\nInstead of presenting detailed formulae for B \u2192 Xs \u03b3 in the DR model, which can be\nfound in the literature [48, 49, 50, 18], we collect here a number of qualitative properties\nof these formulae that will turn out to be useful in understanding our numerical results.\nThese properties are as follows:\n10\u22124\n\n\u2022 The charged and neutral Higgs contributions to BR(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3) are strictly positive.\n\u2022 The sign of the chargino contributions relative to the SM is ruled by the following\nrelation\n+\n\nC7\u03c7\u0303 \u221d +\u03bcAt tan \u03b2 \u00d7 sign(C7SM ) ,\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n(5.17)\n\n\fwith a positive proportionality factor, so it is opposite to that of the SM one for\n\u03bc > 0 and At < 0 (cf. footnote 4).\nThis shows that the large tan \u03b2 effects in B \u2192 Xs \u03b3 are not as strong as in Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ,\nwhere the amplitude behaves as tan3 \u03b2/MA2 . However, they are typically more important\nthan in \u2206Ms , since in the latter case contributions of Higgs penguins, while behaving as\n2 .\ntan4 \u03b2/MA2 , are suppressed by the ratio of the external quark masses over MW\nAmong the NP contributions to B \u2192 Xs \u03b3, those from charginos are generically the\nlargest. In fact, the lightest chargino mass is roughly set by the lowest between \u03bc and M2\nand in the DR model it turns out to be generically below \u2248 200 GeV. On the other hand,\nHiggs contributions are generically small in the DR model, since MA,H + are pushed up by\nthe Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 constraint. Consequently, for positive \u03bc, the sign of the Wilson coefficient\nC7 can be reversed relative to C7SM , while \u2206Ms , as stated above, cannot be modified by\nmore than \u2248 5% if the constraint from Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 is taken into account.\nIndeed, for positive \u03bc, in order to pass the B \u2192 Xs \u03b3 constraint, the model favours the\nsolution C7 (\u03bcb ) = \u2212C7SM (\u03bcb ). We stress here that such solution is a highly conspired one,\nsince such equality should hold at the \u03bcb scale, i.e. after running of the coefficients from\nthe matching scale. In addition, in this case SUSY is not quite a correction to the SM\nresult, but rather the opposite. As a consequence, to address this case, one would need a\ntheoretical control on the SUSY part at least as good as that on the pure SM calculation.\nThis task is in turn very hard to achieve, since e.g., one would have to accurately know\nwhere to integrate out the various sectors of the MSSM entering the SUSY contributions\nto B \u2192 Xs \u03b3. In absence of such knowledge, one can take the approach of matching the\nwhole SUSY spectrum at a common reasonable scale. This approach works if SUSY is a\ncorrection to the SM. But in the present case, the solution C7 (\u03bcb ) = \u2212C7SM (\u03bcb ) is extremely\nsensitive to variation on the matching scale, and the theoretical error associated completely\nout of control. We will come back to this point in section 6.\n5.4 B \u2192 Xsl+ l\u2212\nAn important observable in our analysis will be the branching ratio for the inclusive decay\nB \u2192 Xs l+ l\u2212 and the related forward-backward asymmetry AFB . A significant progress\nin calculating this decay and its exclusive counterpart B \u2192 K \u2217 l+ l\u2212 has been achieved in\nrecent years through the calculation of the NNLO QCD corrections. The corresponding\nformulae are very complicated and will not be presented here. They can be found in\n[51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59]. For our discussion it will be sufficient to recall the NLO\nformulae [60, 61], keeping only the dipole operator and the operators\nQ9 = (sb)V \u2212A (\u03bc\u03bc)V ,\n\nQ10 = (sb)V \u2212A (\u03bc\u03bc)A .\n\n(5.18)\n\nThe contributions of semi-leptonic scalar operators to this decay are much less important\nthan in Bd,s \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , since B \u2192 Xs l+ l\u2212 is not helicity suppressed. We have taken\nthem into account following [62], but their inclusion in the present discussion would only\ncomplicate matters without changing the basic picture.\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\fIntroducing the normalized dilepton mass parameter\n\u015d =\n\n(p\u03bc+ + p\u03bc\u2212 )2\ns\n\u2261 2 ,\nm2b\nmb\n\n(5.19)\n\nthe invariant dilepton mass spectrum in the inclusive decay B \u2192 Xs l+ l\u2212 is roughly given\nat NLO as follows\nd\u0393(B \u2192 Xs l+ l\u2212 )\n\u223c (1 \u2212 \u015d)2 |Vts |2 U (\u015d) ,\nd\u015d\n\n(5.20)\n\nwhere\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0011\n\u0010\n2\n(0)eff 2\n(0)eff\neff\n2\n2\nU (\u015d) = (1 + 2\u015d) |C\u03039 (\u015d)| + |C\u030310 | + 4 1 +\n|C7\n| + 12 C7\nRe(C\u03039eff (\u015d)) , (5.21)\n\u015d\nwith the MSSM expression for the Wilson coefficients C7 [48] and the SM ones for C9 , C10\ngiven in [60, 61, 63]6 .\nOf particular interest is the (normalized) forward-backward asymmetry in B \u2192 Xs l+ l\u2212 .\nIt becomes non-zero only at the NLO level. It is given in this approximation as follows [54]\n\"\n#\neff (\u015d) + 2C (0)eff\n\u015d\nC\u0303\n9\n\u2217\n7\nAFB (\u015d) = \u22123 Re C\u030310\n.\n(5.22)\nU (\u015d)\nThe expression for the corresponding asymmetry in the exclusive decay B \u2192 K \u2217 l+ l\u2212\ncan be found in [58, 59]. Both asymmetries vanish in the SM at a certain \u015d = \u015d0 [66], which\nin the case of the inclusive decay is determined through\n(0)eff\n\n\u015d0 Re C\u03039eff (\u015d0 ) + 2C7\n\n=0.\n\n(5.23)\n\nIn the SM at NLO one finds \u015d0 \u2248 0.14. At NNLO the corresponding value is \u015d0 =\n0.162 \u00b1 0.008 [52, 53, 67, 68, 54].\nNow, as can be seen in (5.21), the very low-s region (s < 1 GeV 2 ) is dominated by\nthe coefficient C7 and does not provide more information than already contained in the\nB \u2192 Xs \u03b3 decay. Much more useful is then the low-s region (1 GeV 2 < s < 6 GeV2 ) which\nis theoretically cleaner than the high-s region, is dominated by the Wilson coefficients C9\nand C10 and is also very sensitive to the C7 -C9 interference in (5.21). For this low-s range\nthe world average coming from Belle [69] and BaBar [70] reads\nBR(B \u2192 Xs l+ l\u2212 )exp = (1.60 \u00b1 0.51) \u00d7 10\u22126 .\n\n(5.24)\n\nConcerning the forward-backward asymmetry AFB , the only existing positive data\ncome from Belle [71], not yet precise enough to be conclusive on the presence of the zero.\nFor our forthcoming discussion, it will be useful to collect the following general properties of B \u2192 Xs l+ l\u2212 in the DR model that will be refined later on:\n6\n\nSUSY contributions to C9 and C10 [64, 65] are completely negligible in the DR model.\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\f\u2022 The Wilson coefficients C9 and C10 receive only small NP contributions so that the\ndepartures of B \u2192 Xs l+ l\u2212 , AFB and \u015d0 from their SM values are governed by the\nmodifications of C7 .\n\u2022 Recalling that C9SM and C7SM have opposite sign, we observe that the flip of the\nsign of C7 by NP contributions will strongly enhance BR(B \u2192 Xs l+ l\u2212 ), while the\nenhancement of |C7 | without the flip of its sign will suppress this branching ratio\nrelative to the SM value [57, 72]\nBR(B \u2192 Xs l+ l\u2212 )SM = (1.58 \u00b1 0.10) \u00d7 10\u22126 ,\n\n(5.25)\n\nthat is in perfect agreement with experiment.\n\u2022 The value of \u015d0 is correlated with BR(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3) if C7 has the SM sign. It increases with increasing BR(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3). This is a direct consequence of small NP\ncontributions to C9 in most NP models as pointed out in [73].\n\u2022 There is no zero in AFB for sign(C7 ) = \u2212sign(C7SM ).\n5.5 B + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd\nFinally, we consider the tree-level decay B + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd.

In\n(5.27), the only hadronic uncertainty resides in B\u0302Bd , while in (5.28) there is an additional\nuncertainty in \u03be. On the other hand, the ratio |Vub /Vcb |2 can be determined from tree-level\ndecays without NP pollution, while |Vtd |2 can clearly be affected by NP contributions.\nUsing the input parameters of Table 2 and 3, we find from (5.27)\n(\n(0.87 \u00b1 0.11) \u00d7 10\u22124 ,\n|Vub |UTfit ,\n+\n+\nBR(B \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd)SM =\n(5.30)\n(1.31 \u00b1 0.23) \u00d7 10\u22124 ,\n|Vub |incl ,\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\fParameter\n103 |Vub |UTfit\n103 |Vub |incl\n103 |Vtd |\nB\u0302Bd\n\u03be\n\u03b7B\n\nValue\n\nRef.\n\nParameter\n\nValue\n\nRef.\n\n3.66(15)\n4.49(33)\n8.49(28)\n1.28(9)\n1.23(6)\n0.55\n\n[40]\n[75]\n[40]\n\n\u2206Ms [ps\u22121 ]\n\u2206Md [ps\u22121 ]\nmt\nmBs\nmB +\n\u03c4B + [10\u221212 s]\n\n17.77(12)\n0.507(5)\n161.7(2.0)\n5.3661(6)\n5.27913(31)\n1.638(11)\n\n[75]\n[75]\n\n[77]\n\n[76]\n[76]\n[76]\n\nTable 2: Input parameters for the SM prediction of BR(B + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd).

Yet, similarly to the case of the B \u2192 Xs \u03b3 decay, extensions of the SM that predict BR(B + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd)\nto be smaller than the SM value seem to be disfavoured at present.\nIn this respect two-Higgs-doublet models of type-II, like the MSSM, where each doublet\ncouples separately to up- and down-type quarks, are interesting as the interference between\nW and H + amplitudes is necessarily destructive [81]. One finds then [82, 83]\n\u0014\n\u00152 DR 2\nm2B +\nVub\ntan2 \u03b2\nBR(B + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd)DR\n= 1\u2212 2\n.\n(5.33)\nRB\u03c4 \u03bd =\nSM\nBR(B + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd)SM\nmH + 1 + \u01eb0 tan \u03b2\nVub\nWe have explicitly shown the dependence on Vub since, in the DR model, the value of |Vub |\nturns out to be even smaller than |Vub | extracted from the UT SM fit.\n5.6 (g \u2212 2)\u03bc\nIn principle we should also consider (g \u2212 2)\u03bc , where the data seem to be above the SM\nexpectations by roughly 3\u03c3. In many supersymmetric models one finds, for large tan \u03b2,\n\u03bc > 0 and slepton masses O(400 GeV), additional contributions to (g \u2212 2)\u03bc that allow to\nfit the data. However, in the DR model, the slepton masses are larger than 1 TeV and\nthe NP contribution amounts to at most one \u03c3 of the SM value. Therefore the DR model\ncannot fit the present data on (g \u2212 2)\u03bc and we will not include this observable in the global\nfit, keeping also in mind that the theoretical status of (g \u2212 2)\u03bc is not yet fully satisfactory\n[84, 85, 86].\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n\f6. General picture\nHaving the formulae for the FC observables at hand, we can discuss first the general pattern\nof these observables within the DR model. A detailed numerical analysis will be presented\nin the next section.\nStep 1\nIn the DR model, due to the unification of Yukawa couplings, tan \u03b2 is forced to be close to\n50. This fact, as already stressed in section 5, requires MA to be sufficiently large in order\nfor the predicted branching ratio of Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 in (5.4) to be consistent with the upper\nbound in (5.3). Typically we find MA > 450 GeV. For such large Higgs masses, one has\nMH + \u2248 MA \u2248 MH0 and this bound is also approximately valid for MH + and MH0 .\nStep 2\nAs already stressed in section 5.3, the large values of MH + and MA imply that NP contributions to BR(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3) are dominated by charginos, with the positive charged and neutral\nHiggs contributions (as well as those from gluinos and neutralinos) being subleading.\nWith \u03bc > 0 it is possible to fit the data on BR(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3) by making the chargino\ncontribution so large that C7SUSY \u2243 \u22122 C7SM at the \u03bcb scale. There are several problems\nwith this choice.\nFirst, there is the problem already stressed at the end of section 5.3. The possibility\nof having C7SUSY \u2243 \u22122 C7SM at the \u03bcb scale implies that the SUSY contribution is not quite\na correction to the SM matching condition, but rather the opposite. With such a large\ncorrection coming from NP, the usual argument of neglecting NLO QCD corrections to\nNP contributions becomes invalid. One would need a control on the NP side at least as\ngood as the one present in the SM contribution. This holds not only for the anomalous\ndimension matrix [87], but also for the matching conditions of the SUSY contributions\n[88, 48, 89, 90]. Indeed, with the use of only LO matching conditions for SUSY, we find\na large sensitivity of the finely-tuned condition C7SUSY \u2243 \u22122 C7SM to the choice of the\nmatching scale for the SUSY contributions. Such sensitivity becomes even stronger on\nthe resulting BR(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3) and this makes a meaningful inclusion of the BR(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3)\nconstraint in the numerical analysis practically impossible.\nSecond, there is no zero in the forward-backward asymmetry AFB , which is however\nstill elusive experimentally [71].\nThird and foremost, it has been shown in [91] that this solution for C7 is actually\nexcluded by the experimental data on BR(B \u2192 Xs l+ l\u2212 ), provided the new physics contributions to the Wilson coefficients C\u03039eff and C\u030310 are small. In fact, the maximal ranges of\nsuch contributions in the MSSM with MFV found in [65] are too small to bring the theory\nprediction for BR(B \u2192 Xs l+ l\u2212 ) in accordance with the experimental data. These findings\nhave also been confirmed in [72].\nIn summary, we want to stress that although we cannot meaningfully take into account\nthe case C7SUSY \u2243 \u22122 C7SM in the numerical analysis due to the theoretical uncertainties described above, we can exclude this case and impose sign(C7 ) \u2261 sign(C7SM ) as a constraint in\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\fthe global fitting procedure, because of the model-independent arguments brought forward\nin the previous paragraph, which are unaffected by such uncertainties.\nStep 3\nIf \u03bc is chosen to be positive and one attempts to be consistent with the data on B \u2192 Xs l+ l\u2212\nin (5.24) by keeping C7 to have the SM sign, as discussed in the previous step, the negative\ncontribution of charginos tends to suppress BR(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3) below acceptable values and\ncan only be tamed by raising the squark masses until these contributions decouple.\nStep 4\nWe next move to \u03bc < 0. In this case, C7 has the same sign as C7SM , but due to constructive\ninterference between SM, scalar and chargino contributions, it tends to be too large, unless\nsquarks are sufficiently heavy. In this respect, we note that, for every given m16 , this case\nis not simply a reflection of the corresponding case with \u03bc > 0. As we will see in the\nnumerical section below, for negative \u03bc the lightest squark masses are generically higher\n(& 2 TeV) than in the corresponding positive \u03bc case.\nStep 5\nLet us finally look at BR(B + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd). We have seen that in order to bring the SM value\nfor this branching ratio close to its central experimental value, it was necessary to choose\nthe tree-level value for |Vub | > 4 \u00d7 10\u22123 . In the DR model, we do not have this freedom as\n|Vub | is in principle a prediction. In practice it is an outcome of the global fit to the model\nparameters and such fit definitely prefers a low value for |Vub |, around 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 . With\nsuch value and the negative contribution from charged Higgses, we find typically\nBR(B + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd) \u2264 0.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 .\n\n(6.1)\n\nWhile this is not yet excluded, in view of the large experimental error in (5.32), also this\ndecay could turn out to be problematic for the DR model if the central experimental value\nwill remain above 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 and the error will decrease by a factor of two.\nFinal remarks\nIn summary, we have shown that while it is possible through choice of the parameters to\nobtain the agreement of the DR model with a given single observable discussed above,\nsimultaneous agreement for all observables is possible at most with very heavy sfermions.\nIn the next section, we will present a detailed numerical analysis of these findings.\n\n7. Numerical analysis\n7.1 Fitting procedure\nWe now turn to describe the numerical strategy adopted to test the DR model. As we\nhave seen in Section 3.1, the model is completely specified in terms of 24 parameters,\n~ After fixing them, it is possible to\nlisted in Table 1 and here collectively indicated as \u03b8.\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\n\freconstruct the whole MSSM at low-energy scales, with a well-controlled theoretical error.\nThe procedure, based on RGEs, which one adopts to connect the GUT scale model to low\nenergies, has been described in Sections 3.2 and 4.\nOnce the low-energy MSSM is specified, the model is testable. To this end, one needs\na suitable set of observables, whose experimental determinations Oi should be as precise as\npossible and, on the theoretical side, calculable within the MSSM with sufficient accuracy.\nSince the MSSM is the low-energy result of the GUT scale model, the theoretical prediction\n~ of the model parameters. In order to compare\nfor the observable Oi will be functions fi [\u03b8]\ntheory predictions with experimental values, one defines a suitable \u03c72 -function as\n!2\nN\nobs\nX\n~ \u2212 Oi\nfi [\u03b8]\n2 ~\n\u03c7 [\u03b8] \u2261\n,\n(7.1)\n\u03c3i\ni=1\n\nwhere the uncertainty \u03c3i associated with the ith observable is defined as\nq\n\u03c3i = (\u03c3i2 )exp + (\u03c3i2 )theo .\n\n(7.2)\n\nHere (\u03c3i )exp is the experimental RMS error and (\u03c3i )theo an estimate of the theoretical error\n~ calculation.\nassociated with the fi [\u03b8]\n2\n~\nThe \u03c7 -function (7.1) is then minimized upon variation of the model parameters \u03b8.\nTo this end, we have adopted the minimization algorithm MIGRAD, which is part of the\nCERNlib library [92]. The minimum value for the \u03c72 -function provides then a quantitative\ntest of the performance of the model in reproducing the observables entering the fit. We\nmention here that, strictly speaking, such test cannot be attached a statistically rigorous\nmeaning, i.e. it is not a 'Pearson's test', since, e.g., the \u03c72 -entries are not all independently\nmeasured observables. Nonetheless, the numerical value of the minimum for the function\n(7.1), as well as the single pulls in its entries, provide a good quantitative indication of the\ndetailed performance of the model for the single observables.\nThe observables used in the fit are reported in Tables 3-5. Concerning the latter, the\nfollowing comments are in order.\n\u2022 The observables in Table 3 were already used \u2013 among the others \u2013 in the previous\nstudies [1, 2] of the DR model, where the very good performance of the model in\nfitting them was demonstrated. We mention that the experimental determination\nof the observables themselves should not rely on any theoretical assumption which\nwould be invalidated in the presence of NP, i.e. one should choose observables whose\ndetermination is NP-independent. This comment applies in particular to CKMrelated quantities, among which one keeps only those measured through tree-level\nprocesses and sin 2\u03b2\u03c8KS , which gives direct access to sin 2\u03b2 since the DR model has\nonly one CP phase in the quark sector.\n\u2022 The observables in Table 4, on the other hand, represent the real novelty of our study\nwith respect to the previous ones. Such FC processes are not calculated after the\nfitting procedure, but instead introduced directly in the \u03c72 -function.

These constraints are in the\nform of suitably smoothened step functions, which are added to the \u03c72 -function of\neq. (7.1). If any of the constraints is violated, the step functions add a large positive\nnumber to the \u03c72 , while for respected constraints the returned value is zero, so that\nthe \u03c72 is set back to its 'unbiased' definition (7.1).\nFurther comments on the determination of\nthe theoretical errors are in order. First, one\ncan note that among the observables in Table\n3, some have a negligible experimental error. In\nthis case, we took as overall uncertainly 0.5% of\nthe experimental value, which we consider a realistic estimate of the numerical error associated\nwith the calculations7 .

As a consequence, such parameters are varied first\n(keeping the other fixed to initial guesses), in order to successfully find an EW symmetry breaking minimum, thereafter varying the rest of the parameters. This procedure is\nschematically described in the flow-chart of Fig. 1. As a final step, all the parameters are\nvaried simultaneously.\nAmong the model parameters, the ones in the SUSY sector are particularly interesting\nsince they set the scale of the SUSY particles' masses. This is especially true for m16 and\n\u03bc. All the other parameters can be left free in the fit, since their typically allowed range of\nvariation is quite narrow. In particular, when m16 is fixed and \u03bc is positive, the fit prefers\nregions of the remaining parameter space such that\n\u03bc, M1/2 \u226a m16 ,\n\n\u2212 A0 \u2243 2m16 ,\n\n\u2013 20 \u2013\n\n(7.3)\n\n\fwhich is favoured by third generation Yukawa unification [94, 95, 96]. Concerning the\nfirst of relations (7.3), M1/2 is bounded from above because otherwise the bottom mass is\npushed up beyond acceptable values by large gluino corrections. In fact, we find that M1/2\nis most of the times chosen in the range [140, 400] GeV, where the lower bound results from\nthe chargino mass bound in Table 5.\nThe second of relations (7.3) leads to an inverted scalar mass hierarchy [97], i.e. heavy\nfirst and second generation sfermions, but lighter third generation sfermions. For the values\nof m16 considered here, namely m16 \u2265 4 TeV, and for \u03bc > 0, this condition also helps to\nobtain the correct prediction for mb [94, 95].\nOn the other hand, the allowed interval for \u03bc is generically wider, for every fixed value\nof m16 . As a consequence, our main strategy is to study the model behavior for different\nchoices of {m16 , \u03bc}, and for each of them, let the rest of the parameter space free to be\ndetermined by the minimization procedure. In the next section we now turn to describe\nthe various scenarios considered in the {m16 , \u03bc} plane.\n7.2 Scenarios\nWe considered increasing values of m16 starting from 4 TeV, which represents the 'minimum' value for successful fits to the observables of Table 3 [1, 2]. For each fixed value of\nm16 we then studied the \u03bc dependence by performing fits with different initial guesses for\nthis parameter. All input values for the model parameters corresponding to these scenarios\nare listed in Table 6. In the following, we describe in detail our findings.\n7.2.1 m16 = 4 TeV, \u03bc > 0\nGiven the inverted scalar mass hierarchy, the relatively low value of m16 leads to stop\nmasses below 1 TeV, resulting in a large chargino contribution to BR(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3).\nAs a matter of fact, the preferred region of\n1\nNP contributions to the latter decay mode reverses the sign for C7 (\u03bcb ): C7 (\u03bcb ) \u2243 \u2212C7SM (\u03bcb ).\n0.5\nOn the fine-tuned character of this case we have\nalready commented in Sections 5.3 and 6. We\n\u2206C7\n0\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\nstress again that within the DR model, this soluCSM\n7\ntion is not viable in view of the implied enhancement to the branching ratio of B \u2192 Xs l+ l\u2212 .\n-0.5\nModel-independent analyses [91, 72] show in fact\nthat to compensate for such enhancement, one\n-1\nwould need substantial contributions to the Wil\u008e+\n\u008e0\nSM\nH\ng\u008e SM+NP\n\u03a7\n\u03a7\nson coefficients C\u03039eff and C\u030310 of the operators in\neq. (5.18). However, within the DR model, these Figure 2: Contributions to C (\u03bc ) for the\n7 b\nWilson coefficients are always SM-like to an ex- scenario of section 7.2.1.\ncellent approximation.\nAs a consequence of the above, we have studied the viability of having the SM sign in\nC7 (\u03bcb ) by imposing this condition as a constraint on the \u03c72 function. The typical fit result\nin this case is illustrated in Table 7.\n\n\u2013 21 \u2013\n\n\fThe fit displays the main problem of the model in this regime for {m16 , \u03bc}, i.e. a\n5\u03c3 discrepancy in the predicted BR(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3). Even imposing the SM sign on C7 (\u03bcb ),\nthe contribution from charginos is still too large in magnitude, and none of the other NP\ncontributions is able to compensate for it. The situation is illustrated in Fig. 2.\nA second, though less severe, problem is the predicted value for BR(B + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd), which\nis roughly 2\u03c3 too low with respect to the experimental average (5.32). This problem is\nstrictly connected to the quite low value for |Vub | \u2248 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 predicted by the model. We\nfound this feature to hold irrespective of the values chosen for {m16 , \u03bc}, so that it should\nbe connected to the specific Yukawa textures of the model.\n7.2.2 m16 = 6 TeV, \u03bc > 0\nSince the BR(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3) problem is related to the low value for \u03bc required (at least for\npositive \u03bc) by m16 = 4 TeV, we have tried to increase the latter in order to understand\nhow fastly decoupling is effective in mildening the problem.\nFor m16 = 6 TeV and \u03bc > 0 the preferred\n1\nrange for \u03bc is roughly \u03bc \u2208 [800, 1000] GeV. A\n0.8\ntypical fit result is displayed in Table 8, corresponding to the case \u03bc = 953 GeV. As a matter\n0.6\nof fact, the discrepancy in B \u2192 Xs \u03b3 is tamed\n\u2206C7\n0.4\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\nto roughly 2.3\u03c3, since chargino contributions are\nCSM\n7\nless important than in the m16 = 4 TeV cases.\n0.2\nThe various contributions to C7 (\u03bcb ) for the fit in\n0\nTable 8 are displayed in Fig. 3. By decreasing \u03bc\nbelow \u2248 800 GeV, the prediction for B \u2192 Xs \u03b3\n-0.2\nfastly worsens. For example, for a converged fit\n\u008e+\n\u008e0\nSM\nH\ng\u008e SM+NP\n\u03a7\n\u03a7\nwith \u03bc = 430 GeV, we found that the discrepancy is already at the 4.2\u03c3 level. Concerning Figure 3: Contributions to C (\u03bc ) for the\n7 b\nB + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd, as anticipated above, the predicted scenario of section 7.2.2.\nrate remains always roughly 2\u03c3 off.\nAs a final remark, while the case m16 = 6 TeV allows, for suitable \u03bc, a smaller discrepancy in B \u2192 Xs \u03b3, the latter comes with the price of a much higher mass for the lightest\nup-type squark, as evident by comparing the corresponding values in Table 11.\n7.2.3 m16 = 10 TeV, \u03bc > 0\nIncreasing m16 further, the chargino contribution to BR(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3) becomes comparable\nin size to the charged Higgs contribution, resulting in acceptable values for this branching\nratio. For example, in the fit of Table 9, the pull in this observable is reduced to 1.3\u03c3.\nOn the other hand, the pull resulting from B + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd is not significantly ameliorated\ncompared to the previous cases. In addition, the lightest squark is as heavy as 1.9 TeV.\n7.2.4 m16 = 4 TeV, \u03bc < 0\nWe explored also the case with negative \u03bc. In this instance, relations in eq. (7.3) (with\n\u03bc \u2192 |\u03bc|) do not apparently need to be fulfilled. As a matter of fact, we found satisfactory\n\n\u2013 22 \u2013\n\n\ffits for a quite wide range of \u03bc: \u03bc \u2208 \u2212[2100, 400] and A0 is always lower in magnitude than\nthe value required by the second relation in eq. (7.3), typically leading to very small At .\nAs a consequence, the squark mass spectrum does not fulfill an inverted mass hierarchy\n[97, 96] and squark masses are generically very heavy. In this case, also heavy Higgses are\nfound to have generically larger masses, & 1.5 TeV. A typical result is shown in Table 10\nand the displayed features remain basically the same in the full allowed range for \u03bc.\nWe observe that, in this case, negative values of \u03bc, large squark masses and small values\nfor At imply small threshold corrections to mb and therefore allow to have successful Yukawa\nunification away from the inverted mass hierarchy condition. We have then investigated\nwhether an acceptable fit away from inverted mass hierarchy could also be obtained for\n\u03bc > 08 . In the latter case, the most important contributions to the mb threshold correction\nhave the same sign and consequently one generically needs larger squark masses than for\n\u03bc < 0, in order to reproduce the right mb value. In fact we find that, unless m16 & 6 TeV,\nthe prediction on mb is 4\u03c3 too large9 and consequently fits with \u03bc > 0 and away from the\ninverted mass hierarchy perform worse than the corresponding negative \u03bc cases.\nWe also note that, in the {m16 , \u03bc} mass scenario considered in the present subsection,\nthe predicted value for BR(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3) is always larger than the SM prediction and close to\nthe experimental value. In fact, small At implies negligible chargino contributions, so that\nthe main correction is the one from Higgses. However, since the lightest stop is around\n2.6 TeV, this scenario clashes with the motivation for SUSY as a solution to the Higgs\nfine-tuning problem.\n7.3 Results\nConsidering the discussion in the last section, it is apparent that for positive \u03bc,\n50\nthe tension between the three decays B \u2192\n40\nXs \u03b3, B \u2192 Xs l+ l\u2212 and Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 can be\nrelieved by raising the universal sfermion\n\u03a72 30\nmass m16 beyond 8 TeV. This is demon20\nstrated in Fig. 4, showing the total \u03c72\nand the contribution of B \u2192 Xs \u03b3 to the\n10\n\u03c72 for increasing values of m16 . For neg0\native \u03bc, fits with comparable \u03c72 can be\n4 TeV,\n6 TeV,\n8 TeV, 10 TeV, 4 TeV,\nachieved with lower values of m16 , but not\n378 GeV 953 GeV 1360 GeV 1200 GeV-2106 GeV\nwith lighter squarks, as the lightest squark\n8m16 , \u039c<\nis still very heavy in these cases.\n2\nHowever, it is well-known that the su- Figure 4: Total \u03c7 (whole bar) and contribution\n2\npersymmetric solution to the gauge hier- of B \u2192 Xs \u03b3 to the \u03c7 (red bar) for the best fits\nwith positive \u03bc and m16 = 4, 6, 8 and 10 TeV,\narchy problem requires light third generarespectively, as well as the best fit with negative\ntion sfermions. Therefore, light stops are \u03bc.\nfavourable to reduce fine-tuning. To show\nthe amount of splitting between fermion and sfermion masses needed in the DR model, we\nplot the lightest stop mass mt\u03031 versus the total \u03c72 for all fits with positive as well as neg8\n9\n\nWe warmly thank R. Derm\u0131\u0301\u0161ek for drawing this point to our attention.\nOne should also take into account the quite precisely known value for mb assumed in the present paper.\n\n\u2013 23 \u2013\n\n\f1\n\nm\u008et \u0090 GeV\n\native \u03bc we obtained (see Fig. 5). There is obviously a strong correlation between the stop\nmass and the quality of the fit, demonstrating that mt\u03031 has to be at least as large as 1.8 TeV\nto cure the problems with the three aforementioned decays. This is significantly heavier\nthan the masses considered in [1, 2] and may be difficult to reconcile with naturalness.\nIn addition, a number of problems of\nthe model persist even for very large m16 .\n\u009f\u009f\n2500\nThese are the issues related to the Yukawa\n\u009f\ntextures: the up-quark mass, Vub and sin 2\u03b2,\n2000\n+\n\u009f\u00e8\nand as a result also \u2206Ms /\u2206Md and B \u2192\n\u00e8\n\u03c4 + \u03bd. This is why there are no points with\n\u00e8\n1500\n\u03c72 . 25 in Fig. 5.

Red circular points are fits with\ncreasing m16 , as can be seen for the best positive \u03bc, blue squares with negative \u03bc.\nfit points in Fig. 4. This fact could give\nrise to an additional problem. Although we did not include the dark matter density as a\nconstraint in our \u03c72 analysis, we conjecture that such large values of \u03bc would give rise to a\nrelic abundance of neutralinos incompatible with the WMAP measurements, for the following reason. Because of the extremely heavy sfermions, the dominant annihilation channel\nfor the neutralino in this scenario is through an s-channel pseudoscalar Higgs. While this\nrate is already suppressed by the large MA , the coupling of neutralinos to the pseudoscalar\nHiggs is additionally suppressed by large \u03bc. This would result in an overabundance of relic\nneutralinos incompatible with observations. Solving this problem by resonant neutralino\nannihilation with m\u03c7\u03030 \u2248 MA /2, as was advocated in an extensive analysis of dark matter\nin this class of models [98, 99], is not possible because of the large MA and the small M1/2\npreferred by the fit.\n\n8. Conclusions\nIn this paper we have performed a detailed analysis of the SO(10) SUSY GUT model with\nD3 family symmetry of Derm\u0131\u0301\u0161ek and Raby [1, 2].\nThis model is entirely specified in terms of 24 parameters. Once they are fixed, the\nwhole MSSM parameter space (including its SM subset) is predicted at low energies with\nthe help of RGEs. The common dependence on the model parameters strongly correlates\nall the low energy observables, in contrast with the direct consideration of the MSSM at\nthe EW scale, where the CKM parameters and the fermion masses are fully independent of\n\n\u2013 24 \u2013\n\n\fthe SUSY particle spectrum. We find that the DR model gives a satisfactory description\nof the quark and lepton matrices as well as of the PMNS and CKM mixing matrices\nwith one exception: the CKM element |Vub | turns out to be significantly smaller than\n|Vub |incl extracted from inclusive tree-level decays and even smaller than |Vub |excl . The\nabove findings are mostly a confirmation of previous studies of the model.\nThe main novelty of our study, with respect to similar analyses of SUSY GUT models\nfound in the literature, is that we analyze simultaneously the mass spectra of quark and\nleptons, the CKM and PMNS mixing matrices, the SUSY mass spectrum and its implied\ncorrections to the FC processes Bs \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , B \u2192 Xs \u03b3, B \u2192 Xs l+ l\u2212 , B + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd and the\nBd,s \u2212 B d,s mass differences \u2206Md,s . The performance of the model is assessed by means of\na global fit to the above mentioned observables.\nThe inclusion of the FC processes listed above turns out to be a crucial test of the\nmass hierarchies predicted by the model for the SUSY spectrum. In fact, such hierarchies\nunavoidably manifest themselves in loop corrections, and FC observables remain the most\nsensitive probes of such corrections. Our analysis demonstrates that the simultaneous\ndescription of all the FC processes listed above is a serious challenge for the DR model.\nIn view of the specific way this failure is realized, we suspect that this is a problem of a\nwider class of SUSY GUTs in which the presence of Yukawa unification implies tan \u03b2 \u2243 50,\nunless non-minimal sources of flavour violation are introduced.\nOur main message is the following one. To really assess the viability of models for\nflavour parameters, it is essential not only to verify their ability to reproduce quark and\nlepton mass spectra and mixing matrices \u2013 in itself an already notable achievement \u2013\nbut also to test the consistency with the data on available FC processes, since the latter\nhave a simultaneous sensitivity to mixing matrices and new particles' spectra. In the DR\nmodel example, FC processes are in fact the best probes available to the SUSY part of\nthe spectrum, where information from direct detection is missing. It turns out that the\nDR model \u2013 otherwise successful for quark and lepton masses as well as for the CKM and\nPMNS matrices \u2013 is challenged only when specifically tested in the simultaneous description\nof quark FCNC processes. The failure in the description of these data makes the viability\nof the DR model questionable from the present perspective, but hopefully offers insights\non further lines of development along similar classes of models.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe warmly acknowledge Radovan Derm\u0131\u0301\u0161ek and Stuart Raby for useful discussions and for\na critical reading of the manuscript.
