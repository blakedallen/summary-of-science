Recent important\nstudies1\u20134 of the momentum distributions and position\ncorrelations5 in light water H2 O and in heavy water D2 O\nhave provided strong evidence that the proton motions\nin light water and deuteron motions in heavy water are\nin reality quantum mechanical. The experimental data\narise from X-ray and neutron scattering experiments. In\nparticular, from deep inelastic neutron scattering from\nprotons, one may deduce the momentum distribution of\nprotons within water and it is found to differ substantially from the Maxwellian distribution expected from\nclassical proton motions. In fact, quantum fluctuations\nin the proton velocity dominate the sometimes presumed\nclassical thermal fluctuations.\nOur purpose here is to provide experimental thermodynamic evidence that the motions of hydrogen atoms in\nliquid water cannot be adequately described by classical\nmechanics. The thermodynamic data are hardly of recent vintage. However, the thermal data have not been\npreviously analyzed in detail for the purpose of assessing\nthe contribution of quantum mechanics to the thermodynamic properties of water. As a theoretical model, we\nat first presume a Hamiltonian which consists of kinetic\nenergy plus Coulomb potential energy; It is\nH = K + V,\n\uf8f1\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f2X P 2\nX p2j \uf8fd\na\nK =\n+\n,\n\uf8f3 a 2Ma\n2m \uf8fe\nj\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f2X z z\n\uf8fd\nX 1\nX\nz\na\nb\na\nV = e2\n+\n\u2212\n, (1)\n\uf8f3\nRab\nr\n|rj \u2212 Ra | \uf8fe\ni<j ij\naj\na<b\n\nwherein the indices a, b, . . . refer to the nuclei of hydrogen\nand oxygen and the indices i, j, . . . refer to the electrons.\nWe also presume that the hydrogen nuclei obey classical\nmechanics to a sufficient degree of accuracy; i.e.\n\u001c 2\u001d\n3\nP\n= kB T (Classical Hydrogen Nucleus). (2)\n2M\n2\nIn Sec.II we prove the following:\nTheorem: Under the presumptions of classical motions\nfor the hydrogen nuclei and with the free energy per\nmolecule f (v, T ) obeying\ndf = \u2212P dv \u2212 sdT,\n\n(3)\n\nthe pressure equation of state P (v, T ) will be identical\nfor light water with proton hydrogen nuclei and heavy\nwater with deuteron hydrogen nuclei. Here, v represents\nthe volume per molecule. As a consequence, light water\nand heavy water are predicted to have identical phase\ndiagrams. These conclusions remain valid for more fully\nquantum electrodynamic microscopic models as shown in\nSec.III.\nThe experimental evidence7 is that the theorem fails\nin the laboratory. For example, at atmospheric pressure,\nthe melting temperature of light ice into light water is\nTm1 \u2248 0 o C. At atmospheric pressure the melting temperature of heavy ice into heavy water is Tm2 \u2248 4 o C. In\nthe concluding Sec.IV, the modifications to the incorrect\npresumption of classical motion required by thermodynamic experiments is discussed.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nTHERMAL EQUATIONS OF STATE\n\nWith N molecules in a volume V , the free energy of\nwater is found from\no\nn\nF = \u2212kB T ln T r(V,N ) e\u2212H/kB T ,\ndF = \u2212P dV + \u03bcdN \u2212 SdT.\n\n(4)\n\nIn the thermodynamic limit, the free energy per molecule\nf (v, T ) = lim\n\nN \u2192\u221e\n\nF (V = N v, N, T )\nN\n\nKH\n\nIII.\n\n(6)\n\nAs an operator, one may consider the Hamiltonian in\nEq.(1) as a function of the hydrogen nuclear mass M .\nHence, the identity\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202H\nKH = \u2212M\n.\n(7)\n\u2202M\nBy a general theorem of statistical mechanics8 , one has\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3\n\u2202F\n= N kB T,\n(8)\nhKH i = \u2212M\n\u2202M V,N,T\n2\nwherein Eq.(2) has been invoked. Regarding the proton\nor the deuteron as the nucleus of the hydrogen atom, it is\nimportant to note that the proton is a Fermion and the\ndeuteron is a Boson. If the nucleus undergoes classical\nmotion, then the whole notion of quantum statistics plays\nno role in the thermal equations of state. The free energy\ndifference between light water and heavy water then can\nbe found by integrating Eq.(8) from the proton mass to\nthe deuteron mass (twice the proton mass to the precision\nwe need here6 ).

On the other\nhand, the difference between light water and heavy water\nis measurable in the laboratory.

This conclusion is in\nphysical agreement with recent results based on deep inelastic neutron scattering1\u20134 and on neutron and X-ray\nscattering5 .\nThe central point is that for a typical motion frequency\n\u03a9, as given in Eq.(A3) below, a necessary condition for\nclassical motion is that\nh\u0304\u03a9\n\u03b2\u03a9 \u2261\n\u226a 1 (Classical Motion)\nkB T\n\n(18)\n\nwhich fails by a large margin for proton and/or deuterium\nmotion in water.\nIn more quantitative detail, suppose one defines a proton quantum noise temperature T\u0303 in terms of the mean\nproton kinetic energy\n3\n1\nM |V|2 \u2261 kB T\u0303 .\n2\n2\n\n(19)\n\nIn general, T\u0303 \u2265 T as proved in Appendix A. If the quantum noise temperature is equal (to a sufficient degree of\naccuracy) to the thermal temperature, T\u0303 \u2248 T , then the\nproton motion may be presumed to be classical.
