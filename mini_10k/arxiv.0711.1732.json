Our data suggest that the mechanism\nleading to the insulator-to-metal transition in La1.2Sr1.8Mn2O7 can be regarded as a polaron coherence\ncondensation process acting in concert with the Double Exchange interaction.\nprofound analogies to the case of underdoped HTSC,\nwhere the superconducting transition is controlled by the\nphase coherence of the Cooper pairs.\nHigh-quality single crystals were grown with the floating\nzone method [10]. The ARPES measurements were carried\nout on beamline 10.0.1 at the Berkeley Advanced Light\nSource using a Scienta R4000 electron analyzer in the 14\u00b0\nangle mode, , with an angular resolutions of \u00b1 0.15\u00b0 ( \u2248 8.3\n\u00d7 10-3 \u00c5-1 in momentum space). The samples were cleaved\nin ultrahigh vacuum (ca. 1-2 x 10-11 torr) at 30 K and\nmeasured with a total instrumental energy resolution of 20\nmeV.\nFig. 1 shows two Energy Distribution Curves (EDC) data\nsets collected below and above TC. The polaron spectral\nfunction consists of a low energy QP peak representing the\nphase coherence of the dressed electrons, and a high energy\nincoherent peak (the hump, H) which tracks closely the\nbare dispersion, in essence reflecting the rapid motion of\nundressed carriers in a frozen lattice configuration [11].\nUpon increasing temperature above TC, the QP peak\ndisappears as a result of the loss of coherence [8. On the\ncontrary, the high energy branch does not show dramatic\nchanges, although we note a shift towards higher binding\nenergies (BE) of the hump peak position in the spectra\ncorresponding to momenta k approaching the Fermi\nmomentum kF, a phenomenology that we discuss in more\ndetail below.\nThe temperature dependent evolution of the QP peak at\nkF is rather abrupt close to TC, showing a collapse when\nthe temperature is raised from T = 86 K to T = 124 K, a\nbehaviour which can not be accounted by thermal\nbroadening effects, but rather suggests a relationship to\nthe macroscopic properties of LSMO (Fig. 2a).\nSurprisingly, the temperature dependence of the\nintegrated spectral weight of the QP peak at kF, which is\ndirectly proportional to Z [12], tracks extremely well the\nDC conductivity curve \u03c3DC as measured on samples\n\nLa1.2Sr1.8Mn2O7 (x = 0.4, LSMO) is a prototypical\nbilayer manganite which exhibits the colossal\nmagnetoresistive (CMR) effect by exploiting a transition\nfrom a ferromagnetic metallic (FM) groundstate to a\nparamagnetic insulating (PI) state above the Curie\ntemperature TC = 120 K. Scattering measurements have\nprovided direct evidence for the presence in the PI state\nof small lattice polarons with pronounced short ranged\ncorrelations forming a polaron glass phase as temperature\napproaches TC from above [1,2,3]. The mechanism\nresponsible for the melting of the polaron glass into the\nFM state below TC remains unclear. Experimental and\ntheoretical evidence has already suggested that the FM\nphase in the manganites is not a conventional metal as\npredicted by the Double Exchange (DE) model [4], but\nrather a polaronic conductor [5,6,7]. In the particular case\nof LSMO, recent Angle Resolved Photoemission\n(ARPES) experiment revealed that the FM phase is a\npolaronic metal with a strong anisotropic character of the\nelectronic excitations, strikingly similar to the pseudogap\nphase in heavily underdoped cuprate high temperature\nsuperconductors (HTSC) [8]. Despite a strong mass\nenhancement and a small renormalization factor or pole\nstrength Z \u2248 0.1, the small but well-defined quasiparticle\n(QP) along the [110] or \"nodal\" direction is found to\naccount for the metallic properties [8,9].\nIn this Letter, we present detailed ARPES\nmeasurements of the temperature dependent evolution of\nthe QP excitations across the PI-to-FM transition. The\ncoherent, polaronic FM groundstate emerges with well\ndefined QPs which, despite a very small pole strength Z,\ntrack remarkably well the DC conductivity, consistent\nwith the macroscopic transport properties. The onset of\nthe FM groundstate is attained in a collective fashion by a\nkinetic energy-driven polaron condensation that\ndramatically enhances the spin DE interaction. This\ncoherence-driven insulator-to-metal transition exhibits\n1\n\n\fgrown in the same laboratory [13], thus yielding an\nempirical \"\u03c3DC \u221d Z\" law (Fig. 2b). It is indeed remarkable\nthat there exist such a net correspondence between DC\nconductivity data and an angle-resolved single particle\nexcitation spectrum. To our knowledge, there is no theory\nof transport which can provide an explanation as to why\n\u03c3DC should be entirely set by the QP pole strength Z. [14].\nOn the contrary, our data suggest a profound link between\ntransport properties and QP coherence.\n\nIntensity (arb. units)\n\ncrossover from a low temperature coherent metallic state\nto a high temperature PI phase with diffusive, incoherent\nmotion of small polarons.\n33 K\n48 K\n68 K\n86 K\n\n106 K\n124 K\n132 K\n149 K\n168 K\n\na)\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\nE \u2013 EF (eV)\n1.0\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n\u03c3ab/\u03c3ab30K\n\n0.8\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\nb)\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\n120\n\nTemperature (K)\n\n150\n\nQP weight / Qp weight 30K\n\nTC\n\n1.0\n\nFig. 2 (color online).

The inset shows the\ndispersions of the hump peak positions.\n\nIn general, the transition between the coherent and\nhopping polaronic regimes is expected to take place at a\ntemperature of the order of some fraction of =\u03c90/kB,\nwhere \u03c90 denotes a fundamental phonon frequency\n[17,18]. In the case of LSMO, however, a mechanism is\nclearly at work which links intimately the degree of\nelectron localization to the onset of ferromagnetism\nsince the coherent-to-incoherent polaron crossover takes\nplace at the Curie temperature TC. The mechanism\nleading to the PI-to-FM transition in LSMO can be\nregarded as a polaron coherence condensation process\nacting in concert with the DE interaction. As the\ntemperature is lowered below TC, a complex many body\nwavefunction is attained in a dynamical percolation\nprocess due to the overlap of the small polarons\nwavefunctions as a result of the increase of their DeBroglie thermal wavelengths, thus transforming the\nclassical insulating liquid of small polarons into a\nquantum-coherent, degenerate metal. The driving force\nfor this transition is the sudden reduction of kinetic\nenergy induced by the synergy of polaron condensation\nand the DE interaction. This synergistic interaction is\ncharacterized by a regenerative aspect of carriers\ndelocalization: the polaron condensation fosters metallic\nconductivity by considerably increasing the overlap of\nthe polaron wavefunctions on adjacent sites, thus\nenhancing the DE interaction and leading to\n\nThis state of affairs resembles closely the temperature\ndependence of the QP intensity in the underdoped HTSC\nBi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d (Bi2212) at (\u03c0,0) [15]. Rather than at\nT*, the temperature at which the gap opens in the\nunderdoped regime, the QP peak in underdoped Bi2212\nexhibits an abrupt behavior at the superconducting\ntransition temperature at which the phase coherence of the\nCooper pairs sets in. Remarkably, the temperature\ndependence of the QP peak shows a resemblance to\ncollective properties related to the superfluid density,\nwhich characterizes the phase coherence of the Cooper\npairs [15,16].\nThe data here reported for LSMO and the analogies\nwith the case of Bi2212 raise an intriguing and\nfundamental question: is there a common origin for the\nunexpected manifestation of collective effects in the\nsingle-particle excitation spectra in systems as different\nas manganites and underdoped HTSC? Our findings\nindicate that the commonality between LSMO and\nunderdoped Bi2212 has to be identified in the coherencedriven nature of the MIT and superconducting transitions\nin LSMO and HTSC, respectively. While in HTSC the\ntransition temperature TC denotes the onset of phase\ncoherence of the Cooper pairs, in LSMO it marks the\n2\n\n\fbetween the value of Z and the ratio mLDA/m* is far from\nbeing trivial [20]. It indeed suggests that the polarons in\nthe FM phase are almost on-site and not extended to the\nnearest neighbor sites. It is the overlap of the small\npolarons wavefunctions resulting from the increase of\ntheir De-Broglie thermal wavelengths that provides the\ncoherence of the polaronic metal as the temperature is\nlowered.\nFurther insights about the peculiar nature of the\npolaronic metal are provided by the temperature\ndependence of the hump peak position. As already\nindicated in Fig. 1, while the spectra corresponding to\nmomenta lower than k \u2248 0.24 \u00c5-1 do not show any shift\nwith temperature (Fig. 3a), the temperature dependence of\nthe hump peak positions is very pronounced for the spectra\nat kF (Fig. 3b). The variation with temperature of the\ndispersions of the hump peak position is non-monotonic,\nand exhibits an abrupt shift close to TC for the spectra at kF\n(Fig. 3c), suggesting a relationship of this phenomenology\nto the macroscopic properties of LSMO. Surprisingly, the\ntemperature dependence of the hump peak position at kF\ntracks \u03c3DC extremely well (Fig. 3d).\nThe temperature dependence of the hump peak position\nat kF can be compared with that of the incoherent\nabsorption (polaron) peak as measured by optical\nconductivity measurements [21,22]. We stress how\nremarkable is the energy scale (hundreds of meV) at\nwhich the spectral weight changes due to modest\ntemperature variations in both ARPES and optics\nexperiments. The hump peak position in ARPES is\ncommonly identified with the polaron BE, thus providing\na rationale for the large energy scale involved in the\nphenomenology described above [23]. At high\ntemperatures, as expected in the case of strong coupling\nlimit where the overlap of the polaron wavefunctions can\nbe neglected (small polarons), the incoherent absorption\npeak measured by optics is found at roughly twice the BE\nof the hump peak in ARPES, indicating that the latter\ndenotes indeed the polaron BE EP. At low temperatures,\nhowever, the ARPES hump peak and the incoherent\nabsorption peak in optics are not any more related in a\nsimple way, most likely as a result of polaron\nwavefunctions overlap, suggesting that a full\nunderstanding of the polaron metal poses a much more\ncomplex many body problem than that of an isolated\nelectron interacting with the lattice (small polaron). More\nimportantly, the correspondence between the temperature\ndependences of the hump peak position at kF and the QP\nspectral weight at EF indicates that Z and EP are related by\na linear dependence like Z \u221d EP/=\u03c90, whereas\nconventional polaron theories predict a much stronger\ndependence of the form Z \u221d exp (-EP/=\u03c90), thus providing\nanother distinctive characteristic of the coherent polaronic\nmetal [17]. Our data suggest that the low (QP) and the\nhigh (Hump) energy scale physics are related: the loss of\npolaron quantum coherence, signaled as a collapse of the\nQP peak at very low energy, involves major\nrearrangements on a much higher energy scale visible as a\nconsiderable transfer of spectral weight from the QP peak\nto higher BE resulting in the shift of the hump peak\nposition close to kF. This shift is possibly related to the\nfact that the small JT polarons exhibit larger degrees of\n\na)\n\nk = 0.20 \u00c5-1\n-1.0\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\nT (K) =\n33\n48\n68\n86\n106\n124\n132\n149\n168\n\nb)\n\nk = kF = 0.37 \u00c5-1\n-1.0\n\nE \u2013 EF (eV)\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\nE \u2013 EF (eV)\n1.5\n\nc)\n0.30\n\nTC\n\n1.2\n\n\u03c3ab (103 S cm-1)\n\n0.24\n\n0.9\n\n-0.30\n\nd)\n\n-0.50\n-0.55\n\n0.3\n\n-0.8\n\n-0.60\n-0.65\n\n0.0\n\nkF\n\n-0.6\n\nE \u2013 EF (eV)\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.40\n-0.45\n\n0.6\n\n0.36\n\n-0.35\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\n120\n\n150\n\nTemperature (K)\n\nHump peak position at kF (eV)\n\nMomentum (\u00c5-1)\n\nIntensity (arb. units)\n\nferromagnetism, while the DE interaction in turn\nenhances the carriers mobility and accelerates the\npolaron coherence condensation. We stress that both the\npolaron condensation and DE interaction are necessary\nfor the MIT in LSMO. While the DE alone would not be\nsufficient to drive the MIT, it stills plays a crucial role in\ntipping the balance between the competing tendencies\ntowards localization and delocalization.\nThe \"\u03c3DC \u221d Z\" relation can be qualitatively\nrationalized by considering the metallic state as yielded\nby a superposition of a coherent quantum state, which\nwe refer to as polaron groundstate, and a highly\ndegenerate classical state at higher energy formed by\nsmall Jahn-Teller (JT) polarons, which we refer to as\nsmall polaron state. While the polaron groundstate is\nunique, the small polaron state is highly degenerate\nbecause the number of possibilities of forming a small\nJT polaron is of the order of the number of lattice sites.\nAs the temperature is increased, the polaron groundstate\nis easily excited to the small polaron state with larger\nentropy. The fraction of polaron groundstate is thus a\ndecreasing function of temperature, like \u03c3DC in the\nmetallic state, with the loss of polaron quantum\ncoherence being signalled by the progressive\ndisappearance of the QP peak.\n\nFig. 3 (color online).

(d) Comparison between the variation with\ntemperature of the hump peak position at kF and \u03c3ab (from 13).\nOpen and filled squares denote warm up and cooling down\ncycles, respectively.\n\nWe emphasize that by \"polaron groundstate\" we\ndesignate a distinctive state which is not to be identified\nwith the canonical large polaron, but rather a state\nwherein all the particles in the system are locked in a\ncomplicated many body wavefunction whose expansion\non a basis of single particle states yields the QP pole\nstrength Z \u2248 0.10. This estimate of Z is in good\nagreement with the value determined from the ratio of\nthe QP effective mass m* and the bare band mass mLDA,\nnamely Z = mLDA/m*\u2248 0.16, a legitimate estimate when a\npossible momentum dependence of the self energy is\nneglected [19]. However, this direct correspondence\n3\n\n\flattice distortions and a larger number of phonons than in\nthe coherent polaron state below TC.\nIn summary, we provide experimental evidence that the\ntemperature variation of \u03c3DC in LSMO is intimately\nrelated to that of the coherent QP weight Z, a quantity in\nessence representing the coherent fraction of the polaronic\nmetallic groundstate. Our data suggest that the mechanism\nleading to the insulator-to-metal transition in LSMO can\nbe regarded as a polaron coherence condensation process\nacting in concert with the DE interaction. The driving\nforce for this transition is the sudden onset of coherence\nand concomitant reduction of kinetic energy induced by\n\nthe synergistic and regenerative interaction between the\npolarons condensation and the DE interaction. The\nanalogy of this effect to the case of underdoped Bi2212\nsuggests that coherence-driven transitions are a common\ndenominator for the high temperature quantum\nphenomena in transition metal oxides.\nThe work at the ALS is supported by the DOE Office of\nBasic Energy Science, Division of Material Science, under\ncontracts DE-FG03-01ER45929-A001 and DE-AC03765F00515.

Since the\nsame temperature dependence is obtained when the QP\nweight is normalized with respect to the intensity of the\nentire peak-dip-hump structure after subtracting a Shirley\nbackground, the temperature dependence of the QP\nweight can unambiguously be identified with that of Z.\n[13] Q.A.
