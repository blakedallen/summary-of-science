We initiate a classification of polynomials f : Cn \u2192 C of degree d having the\ntop Betti number of the general fibre close to the maximum. We find a range in which the\npolynomial must have isolated singularities and another range where it may have at most\na line singularity of Morse transversal type, besides controlled singularities at infinity.\nOur method uses deformations into particular pencils with non-isolated singularities.\n\n1. Introduction and results\nLet f : Cn \u2192 C be a polynomial function of degree d \u2265 2, where n \u2265 2. It is wellknown that f is a locally trivial fibration over C outside a finite number of atypical values,\n[Th, Br1]. It's general fibre G is a Stein manifold and therefore homotopy equivalent to\na CW-complex of dimension n \u2212 1, by [Ka, Ha]. We shall call top Betti number of f and\ndenote bn\u22121 (f ) := bn\u22121 (G) the (n \u2212 1)th Betti number of the general fibre. While this\nnumber is clearly bounded in terms of n and d, our aim is to find what are the special\nproperties of f which make bn\u22121 (f ) approach the maximum (d \u2212 1)n . Let us call top Betti\ndefect of f the difference \u2206n\u22121 (f ) := (d \u2212 1)n \u2212 bn\u22121 (f ).\nWe prove in this paper that if \u2206n\u22121 (f ) is small enough, then the polynomial has special\ntypes of singularities. To do that, we study deformations of polynomials from a new\nviewpoint, namely by following the general fibre in the deformation process and drawing\nconsequences on the \"quantity\" of singularities measured by the top Betti number.\nDeformations of polynomial functions with given degree have been studied from the\npoint of view of topological equivalence. In the 1960s Thom conjectured, and then Fukuda\n[Fu] proved, that there are finitely many equivalence classes. In [BT] one employs previous results on deformation of germs to extend the L\u00ea-Ramanujam-Timourian criterion\nfor the topological equivalence in families of germs to families of polynomials by using\nthe constancy of Milnor numbers including those at infinity. The deformation theory\nof projective hypersurfaces, a classical topic with more recent contributions by Shustin\nand Tyomkin [ShT], is also related to the deformation of polynomials. In [SS] one uses\ndeformations to classify polynomials of 2 variables and degree 4, with respect to their\nsingularities at infinity.\nDate: January 17, 2011.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 32S30, 58K60, 55R55, 32S50.\nKey words and phrases. deformation of hypersurfaces and polynomials, general fibres, singularities at\ninfinity, boundary singularities.\nThe authors acknowledge the support of the Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach under\nthe frame of the Research-in-Pairs program.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDIRK SIERSMA AND MIHAI TIB\u0102R\n\nIn order to state the precise results, we need a few definitions. We consider Pn as the\nstandard compactification of Cn for some fixed affine coordinates. We use the following\nnotations: Xt = f \u22121 (t) is some fibre of f and Xt \u2229H \u221e is the intersection of its closure in Pn\nwith the hyperplane at infinity H \u221e := Pn\u22121 . We denote by fd and fd\u22121 the degree d and\nn\u22121 \u2202fd\nd \u2212 1 parts of f , respectively. Let \u03a3\u221e\n| \u2202xi (x) = 0, i = 1, . . . , n}.\nf := Sing fd = {[x] \u2208 P\n\u221e\nGeometrically, \u03a3f is the set of singular points of the restriction Xt \u2229 H \u221e and this set\ndoes not depend on the value t \u2208 C. We call such points tangencies at infinity. An affine\nhypersurface in Cn will be called general-at-infinity if its projective closure is non-singular\nin the neighbourhood of the hyperplane at infinity H \u221e and intersects it transversely. The\npolynomial f will be called general-at-infinity (or of G-type) iff all its fibres are generalat-infinity. Since this is equivalent to \u03a3\u221e\nf = \u2205, it means that f is general-at-infinity iff\nsome fibre of f is so.\nTheorem 1.1. Let f : Cn \u2192 C be some polynomial of degree d \u2265 2. Then:\n(a) \u2206n\u22121 (f ) \u2265 0 and the equality holds if and only if f is general-at-infinity.\n(b) If 0 < \u2206n\u22121 (f ) \u2264 d \u2212 1 then dim Sing f \u2264 0 and dim \u03a3\u221e\nf \u2264 0.\n\u221e\n(c) If d \u2264 \u2206n\u22121 (f ) < 2d \u2212 2 for d \u2265 3, then dim \u03a3f \u2264 0 and either dim Sing f \u2264 0 or\nSing f is a line with generic Morse transversal type and transverse to the hyperplane\nat infinity.\nLet us remark that the above bounds depend only on the degree and not on the number of variables. In our proof we have to start with some polynomial f and reduce the\ndimensions of Sing f and of \u03a3\u221e\nf to 1, by using special deformations. Then we analyse one-dimensional singularities. It appears for instance that the complementary case\n\"dim Sing f \u2264 0 and dim \u03a3\u221e\nf = 1\" does not occur in the range of Theorem 1.1(c). To investigate this setting, we study in \u00a75 the Euler characteristic of a projective hypersurface\nwith one-dimensional singular locus by developing a pencil technique which goes beyond\nthe usual Lefschetz method since in our setting we deal with non-isolated singularities.\nThis section is therefore of an independent interest. From its main result Theorem 5.3 we\nderive in \u00a76 that positive dimensional singularities in the hyperplane at infinity produce\na deeper Betti defect, namely:\nTheorem 1.2. If f has at most isolated affine singularities and \u03a3\u221e\nf is a reduced projective\nline with generic Morse transversal type, then\n\u2206n\u22121 (f ) \u2265 2(n \u2212 1)(d \u2212 2) + 1.\nThese results set the bases of a classification of polynomial functions with top Betti\nnumber close to the maximum in terms of their singularities, and more particularly of\nthose appearing at infinity. Our study is based on algebro-topological deformation tools\nand on the refined interplay between isolated and non-isolated singularities via polar curve\ntechniques like explored in [L\u00ea, Yo, Si1, Si2, Si3] etc.\nIn case of polynomials with isolated singularities, namely dim Sing f \u2264 0 and dim \u03a3\u221e\nf \u2264\n0, one may list the possible combinations of critical points at infinity which yield generic\nfibres with top Betti number close to the maximum. We give below the list for any n \u2265 2,\nup to the top Betti defect equal to 3. The notation h*|*i means the singularity type of the\nboundary pair (G, G \u2229 H \u221e ) at some point at infinity (see \u00a72), where G is some general\n\n\fBETTI BOUNDS OF POLYNOMIALS\n\n3\n\nfibre of f . The additive notation is used if multiple special points occur at infinity. On the\nsecond column there appear the singularity types at one, two or three points at infinity,\nwhere A0 stands for \"nonsingular\". The third column contains the Arnol'd type fraction\nnotation, cf [Ar2]. According to Theorem 1.1(b), this gives all the types of general fibres of\npolynomials with small top Betti defect. The realisation of each type is an easy exercise;\nnote that for some classes we need high enough degrees.\n\u2206n\u22121 (f )\n0\n1\n2\n\n3\n\nboundary type\nhA0 |A0 i\nhA0 |A1 i\nhA0 |A2 i\n2hA0 |A1 i\nhA1 |A1 i\nhA0 |A3 i\nhA0 |A2 i + hA0 |A1 i\n3hA0 |A1 i\nhA1 |A2 i\nhA1 |A1 i + hA0 |A1 i\nhA2 |A1 i\n\nArnol'd type\nA0\nA1\nA2\n2A1\nB2\nA3\nA2 + A1\n3A1\nC3\nB2 + A1\nB3\n\nLet us remark that [SS] contains a certain algebraic classification for n = 2 and d = 4,\ntogether with the computation of the Milnor numbers of the singularities at infinity,\ncontinuing the classification by C.T.C. Wall in degree 3 and two variables [Wa].\nWe close this introduction by a few examples, some of them showing that the bounds\nin our theorems are sharp.\n1\nExample 1.3. f = x + x2 y. We have n = 2, d = 3, Sing f = \u2205 and \u03a3\u221e\nf = [0; 1] \u2208 P .\nThe computation yields b1 (f ) = 1 and therefore \u22061 (f ) = 4 \u2212 1 = 3 which corresponds to\nthe situation in Theorem 1.1(c).\n\nExample 1.4. f = x2 y. Here n = 2, d = 3, Sing f = {x = 0} is a line with transversal\n1\ntype A1 and \u03a3\u221e\nf = [0; 1] \u2208 P . By computation we have b1 (f ) = 1 and so \u22061 (f ) =\n4 \u2212 1 = 3. This corresponds to the situation in Theorem 1.1(c) and also shows that the\nestimation is sharp. In full generality, for any n \u2265 2 and d > 2, let f = (a1 z12 + * * * +\n2\nd\nan\u22121 zn\u22121\n)xd\u22122 + c1 z1d + * * * + cn\u22121 zn\u22121\n. This is a homogeneous polynomial and has a line\nsingularity L = {z1 = . . . = zn\u22121 = 0}. For general coefficients ai , ci , this polynomial\nhas no other singular point and the line L is transversal to H \u221e and has Morse generic\ntransversal singularity type. The projective hypersurface {fd = 0} has a single singular\npoint at p := [1; 0; * * * ; 0]. By a local computation, the singularity type of Xt at p is Ad\u22121\nfor t 6= 0. Then we may apply formula (3) of Proposition 2.4 since by Remark 2.5 this\nworks in our situation too. Indeed, the fibre Xt of f has reduced homology concentrated\nin dimension n \u2212 1 since it is diffeomorphic to the Milnor fibre of f at the origin (by the\nhomogeneity) and since by [Si1] this line singularity Milnor fibre is homotopy equivalent\nto a bouquet of spheres of dimension n \u2212 1. So by (3) we get \u2206n\u22121 (f ) = d \u2212 1 + 1 = d,\nwhich also shows that the lower bound in Theorem 1.1(c) is sharp.\n\n\f4\n\nDIRK SIERSMA AND MIHAI TIB\u0102R\n\nExample 1.5. Let f = z d + z 2 xd\u22122 + z 2 y d\u22122 + xy(xd\u22123 \u2212 y d\u22123), where n = 3 and d \u2265 3.\nThen f has isolated affine singularities and \u03a3\u221e\nf is a reduced projective line with generic\ntransversal type A1 . Let us compute \u22062 (f ) using Proposition 2.4 and its notations.\nLet Xt denote a general fibre. Then H \u221e \u2229 Sing Xt = {z = 0, xy(xd\u22123 \u2212 y d\u22123 ) = 0}. By\ncomputing in coordinate charts it follows that the set Sing Xt consists of d \u2212 1 Morse\nsingularities. According to formula (2), this contributes with d \u2212 1 to the top Betti defect.\nNext we compute \u2206\u03c7\u221e from the same formula. We have fd = z 2 (z d\u22122 + xd\u22122 + y d\u22122) and\nthe reduced hypersurface {fd = 0} \u2282 P2 has degree d \u2212 1 and precisely d \u2212 2 singular\npoints which are Morse. This implies the equality \u03c7({fd = 0}) = \u03c72,d\u22121 + d \u2212 2. Since\n\u03c72,d\u22121 = \u2212(d \u2212 1)2 + 3(d \u2212 1), we get \u03c7({fd = 0}) = \u2212d2 + 6d \u2212 6, which yields \u2206\u03c7\u221e =\n\u03c72,d \u2212 \u03c7({fd = 0}) = \u22123d + 6. By formula (2) we then get \u22062 (f ) = d \u2212 1 + 3d \u2212 6 = 4d \u2212 7.\nThis corresponds to the equality in Theorem 1.2, showing that the bound is sharp for\nn = 3. See also Remark 6.1.\n2. Preliminaries on deformations of polynomials\nBy one-parameter deformation of f we mean a holomorphic map P : Cn \u00d7 C \u2192 C,\nwhere Ps := P (*, s) is a polynomial of degree d for any s \u2208 C, and such that P0 = f . We\nshall work with germs at s = 0 of such families of polynomials. Let Gs denote the general\nfibre of Ps . We start from the following result about the behaviour of the general fibre in\nsuch a deformation.\nProposition 2.1. [ST3] For s 6= 0 close enough to 0, the general fibre G0 of P0 can be\nnaturally embedded in the general fibre Gs of Ps such that the embedding G0 \u2282 Gs induces\nan injective map Hn\u22121 (G0 ) \u0592\u2192 Hn\u22121(Gs ).\n\u0003\nOne derives from this the following semi-continuity principle for the top Betti number,\na cornerstone of our study:\n(1)\n\n\u2206n\u22121 (Ps ) \u2264 \u2206n\u22121 (P0 ), for s 6= 0 close enough to 0.\n\nAnother key fact, that we shall now prove, is that any polynomial is deformable into a\ngeneral-at-infinity polynomial (defined in \u00a71).\nIt is well-known that the Euler characteristic of a non-singular and general-at-infinity\nhypersurface of degree d in Cn is equal to 1 + (\u22121)n\u22121 (d \u2212 1)n . By its definition, a G-type\npolynomial may have special fibres with at most isolated singularities. An example of a\ngeneral-at-infinity polynomial of degree d is xd1 + * * * + xdn .\nProposition 2.2. Any polynomial can be deformed into a general-at-infinity polynomial\nof the same degree. More precisely, let hd be some general-at-infinity polynomial of degree\nd. Then the deformation f\u03b5 := f + \u03b5hd transforms any given polynomial f of degree d\ninto a general-at-infinity polynomial f\u03b5 , for any \u03b5 6= 0 close enough to 0.\nProof. Let us first remark that one may deform any hypersurface X \u2282 Cn in a constant\ndegree family {Xs }s\u2208\u03b4 such that X = X0 and that Xs is general-at-infinity and nonsingular\nfor s 6= 0 in a small enough disk \u03b4 centered at 0 \u2208 C, as follows. Let Xs = {(1 \u2212 s)f +\ns(hd \u2212 1) = 0}. The family {Xs = 0}s\u2208[0,1] has a finite number of special members\nsince it contains the general-at-infinity non-singular hypersurface {hd = 1} and since\n\n\fBETTI BOUNDS OF POLYNOMIALS\n\n5\n\ntransversality and non-singularity are open properties. It follows that only a finite number\nof the hypersurfaces of this pencil are not general-at-infinity or singular. Then the family\n{Xs }s\u2208\u03b4 has the desired property for a small enough disk \u03b4 centered at 0.\n\u03b5\nNext, consider the deformation f\u03b5 = f +\u03b5hd of f . Taking s = \u03b5\u22121\nin the above pencil we\ndeduce that the fibre f\u03b5 = \u03b5 is general-at-infinity. Since the generic fibre of a polynomial\nis well-defined, we deduce that f\u03b5 is a general-at-infinity polynomial for any small enough\n\u03b5 6= 0.\n\u0003\nBoundary singularities. We assume in the remainder of this paper that f : Cn \u2192 C is a\npolynomial function of degree d. Let Yt = f \u22121 (t). At some point p \u2208 H \u221e we consider the\nboundary germ (Yt , Yt \u2229H \u221e )p which is actually a family of germs depending on t \u2208 C. This\nfamily has a constant singularity type outside finitely many values of t. The singularity\ntheory of germs of boundary singularities with respect to a hyperplane has been studied\nby Arnol'd [Ar1]. He introduced the concept of isolated boundary singularity and gave a\nlist of simple singularities. Some of the types occur for instance in our table in \u00a71.\nDefinition 2.3. One says that the boundary pair (Yt , Yt \u2229H \u221e )p has an isolated singularity\nif both Yt and Yt \u2229 H \u221e have (at most) isolated singularities at p.\nWe have the equivalence: the boundary pair (Yt , Yt \u2229 H \u221e ) has isolated singularities if\n\u221e\nand only if Yt has isolated singularities and dim \u03a3\u221e\nf \u2264 0. Then \u03a3f \u2229 {fd\u22121 = 0} is the\nsubset of points of H \u221e where Yt is singular, and this does not depend on the value t \u2208 C.\nProposition 2.4. Let f be a polynomial of degree d and isolated singularities, having\ngeneral fibre X0 and satisfying dim \u03a3\u221e\nf \u2229 {fd\u22121 = 0} \u2264 0.

Formula (2) was stated without proof in [ST3, (6.1 and (6.2)], [Ti3, \u00a74]. We\nconsider the germ of a deformation of X0 in a constant degree family {Xs }s\u2208\u03b4 such that\nXs is non-singular and general-at-infinity for s 6= 0; this exists according to Proposition\n2.2. For any s, we have the equality of Euler characteristics \u03c7(Xs ) = \u03c7(Xs ) \u2212 \u03c7(Xs \u2229 H \u221e )\nand taking the difference we get, for s 6= 0:\n\u03c7(X0 ) \u2212 \u03c7(Xs ) = \u03c7(X0 ) \u2212 \u03c7(Xs ) \u2212 \u03c7(X0 \u2229 H \u221e ) + \u03c7(Xs \u2229 H \u221e )\nOur family {Xs }s\u2208\u03b4 is in particular a smoothing of the hypersurface X0 with isolated\nsingularities and thus the jump of Euler characteristics is the sum of the Milnor numbers\nof the singularities of X0 :\nX\n\u03bcp (X0 ).\n\u03c7(X0 ) \u2212 \u03c7(Xs ) = (\u22121)n\np\u2208\u03a3\u221e\nf \u2229{fd\u22121 =0}\n\n\f6\n\nDIRK SIERSMA AND MIHAI TIB\u0102R\n\n\u221e\nis a smoothing of X0 \u2229 H \u221e and we get the\nIn case dim \u03a3\u221e\nf \u2264 0, the family Xs \u2229 H\nP\nfollowing similar equality: \u03c7(X0 \u2229 H \u221e ) \u2212 \u03c7(Xs \u2229 H \u221e ) = (\u22121)n\u22121 p\u2208\u03a3\u221e \u03bcp (X0 \u2229 H \u221e ).\nf\nUp to this point the Euler characteristic computation runs like in [Di, ch.1, Prop. 4.6].\nNext we need that the general fibre has concentrated homology in the top dimension,\nwhich is true since the polynomial f has isolated singularities in the sense of [Pa] or [ST1]\nand by loc.cit., the general fibre has the homotopy type of a bouquet of spheres S n\u22121\nand therefore its reduced homology is concentrated in dimension n \u2212 1. This implies that\n\u03c7(X0 ) = 1 \u2212 (\u22121)n bn\u22121 (X0 ). We also have that \u03c7(Xs ) = 1 \u2212 (\u22121)n (d \u2212 1)n since Xs is\ngeneral-at-infinity and non-singular. Collecting these information we get formulas (2) and\n(3).\n\u0003\n\nRemark 2.5. The above proof shows that the hypothesis \"dim Sing f \u2264 0\" of Proposition\n2.4 may be replaced by \"the general fibre of f has the reduced homology concentrated in\ndimension n \u2212 1\".\n3. Polynomials with non-isolated singularities\nLet f : Cn \u2192 C be a polynomial of degree d \u2265 2 with singular loci of dimension \u2265 2,\nmore precisely dim Sing f \u2265 2 or dim \u03a3\u221e\nf \u2265 2. If one deforms f directly to general-atinfinity polynomials, then it appears that comparing the general fibres becomes a difficult\ntask. A better strategy would be to deform f in two steps and use the semi-continuity\nprinciple (1) according to the following program: (a). deform such that the dimension\nof the singularity locus decreases to one, and then (b). compare the new polynomial to\nanother deformation of it into a polynomial satisfying the hypothesis of Proposition 2.4\nor directly use results from the theory of one-dimensional singularities. The reason is that\none-dimensional singularities and their deformations are quite well understood, due to the\nwork of L\u00ea [L\u00ea], Yomdin [Yo] and the detailed study by Siersma [Si1] and his school, see\ne.g. the survey [Si4].\nLet l : Cn \u2192 C be a linear function. We denote by:\n\u0393(l, f ) := closure[Sing (l, f ) \\ Sing f ] \u2282 Cn\nthe polar locus of f with respect to l. One has the following Bertini type result, proved in\n[Ti1, Ti2], [Ti3, Thm. 7.1.2]:\nLemma 3.1. There is a Zariski-open subset \u03a9f of the dual projective space P\u030cn\u22121 such\nthat, for any l \u2208 \u03a9f , the polar locus \u0393(l, f ) is a reduced curve or it is empty.\n\u0003\nWe may and shall also assume (by eventually restricting \u03a9f to some open Zariski subset\nof it) that if dim Sing f \u2265 1 then dim Sing f \u2229 {l = 0} = dim Sing f \u2212 1 for any l \u2208 \u03a9f .\nWe then say that l is general with respect to f whenever l \u2208 \u03a9f . With these settings we\nmay start our program.\nLemma 3.2. Let l be general with respect to f and to fd . If dim Sing f \u2265 1, or if\nd\ndim \u03a3\u221e\nf \u2265 1, then the deformation f\u03b5 = f + \u03b5l reduces by one the dimension of the\nrespective singular locus. If f has the property that dim Sing f \u2264 0 or dim \u03a3\u221e \u2264 0 then\nf\u03b5 preserves this property.\n\n\fBETTI BOUNDS OF POLYNOMIALS\n\n7\n\nProof. After some linear change of coordinates, we may assume that l = xn . Then\n\u2202f\n= 0, . . . , \u2202x\u2202f\n= 0}. Let us first show that dim Sing f\u03b5 = dim Sing f \u2212 1\nSing (l, f ) = { \u2202x\n1\nn\u22121\nwhenever dim Sing f \u2265 1. We have the inclusions:\nSing f \u2229 {l = 0} \u2282 Sing f\u03b5 \u2282 (Sing f \u2229 {l = 0}) \u222a \u0393(l, f )\n\u2202f\n+ \u03b5dld\u22121 cannot\nsince if x \u2208 Sing f\u03b5 \u2229 Sing f then x \u2208 {l = 0}. The algebraic function \u2202x\nn\nbe identically zero on some component \u0393i \u2282 \u0393(l, f ) for more than one nonzero value of \u03b5.\nThese facts show that, for \u03b5 6= 0 in some small enough neighbourhood of 0 in C, Sing f\u03b5\nis the union of Sing f \u2229 {l = 0} and a finite set of points.\nNext, let us show what is the effect of this deformation on \u03a3\u221e\nf . Taking fd instead of f\nin the above proof, the genericity of l = xn implies, via Lemma 3.1, that \u0393(l, fd ) is either\nempty or a homogeneous algebraic set of dimension 1 in Cn and hence a finite set of points\nin Pn\u22121 . It is also clear that Sing (fd + \u03b5ld ) \u2229 Sing fd = Sing fd \u2229 {l = 0}. These show\nthat Sing (fd + \u03b5ld ) is the union of Sing fd \u2229 {l = 0} and a finite set of points (eventually\n\u221e\nempty) and therefore that dim \u03a3\u221e\n\u0003\nf\u03b5 = dim \u03a3f \u2212 1, provided that the former is \u2265 1.\n\nLemma 3.3. Let l be general with respect to f and consider the deformation f\u03b5 = f + \u03b5l.\nIf dim Sing f \u2265 1 then there exists a small disk centered at the origin D \u2282 C such that\n\u221e\n\u2217\ndim Sing f\u03b5 \u2264 0 and \u03a3\u221e\nf\u03b5 = \u03a3f , for any \u03b5 \u2208 D .\nProof. As in the above proof we may assume that l = xn . For any \u03b5 6= 0 we have\n\u2202f\n+ \u03b5 cannot be identically zero\nSing f \u2229 Sing f\u03b5 = \u2205 and the polynomial function \u2202x\nn\non some irreducible component \u0393i \u2282 \u0393(l, f ) for two different values of \u03b5. The claim\nfollows.\n\u0003\nWith these preparations we may consider in the next statements the two cases of\ndimension one singular locus.\nProposition 3.4. If f is a polynomial of degree d with dim \u03a3\u221e\nf = 1 and dim Sing f \u2264 0\nthen\n\u2206n\u22121 (f ) \u2265 d \u2212 1.\nProof. We consider the deformation f\u03b5 = f + \u03b5ld for general l as in Lemma 3.2. It then\nfollows that dim Sing f\u03b5 \u2264 0 and that Sing f\u03b5,d \u2282 Pn\u22121 is the union of \u03a3\u221e\nf \u2229 {l = 0} and\neventually some finite set of points. We may assume that the hyperplane {l = 0} slices\n\u221e\n\u03a3\u221e\nf at regular points only; this property is generic too. Let then \u03a3f = \u222ar \u03a3r be the\ndecomposition into irreducible components and let p \u2208 \u03a3r \u2229 {l = 0} for some r. In order\nto compute the top Betti defect \u2206n\u22121 (f\u03b5 ) = (d \u2212 1)n \u2212 bn\u22121 (X\u03b5 ) for some general fibre X\u03b5\nof f\u03b5 , we may use formula (3) in which one of the ingredients is \u03bcp (X\u03b5 \u2229 H \u221e ) and observe\nthat this is equal to \u03bcp (f\u03b5,d).\nWe denote by \u03bc\u22d4r the Milnor number of the transverse singularity of \u03a3r . By the local\nL\u00ea attaching formula, see [L\u00ea], [Yo] and [Si3], we have:\n(4)\n\n\u03bcp (f\u03b5,d) + \u03bcp ((f\u03b5,d)|l=0 ) = multp (\u0393\u0302p (l, f\u03b5,d ), {f\u03b5,d = 0}) + multp (\u03a3r , {f\u03b5,d = 0})\u03bc\u22d4r\n\nwhere \u0393\u0302p (l, f\u03b5,d ) denotes the union of the components of the germ at p of the polar curve\nof the map \u03c8 := (l, f\u03b5,d ) : (Cn , 0) \u2192 (C2 , 0) other than the singular locus \u03a3r .\n\n\f8\n\nDIRK SIERSMA AND MIHAI TIB\u0102R\n\nv= f\n\n\u03b5,d\n\n\u2206\n\n\u03b7\n\n0\n\nu= l\n\nFigure 1. Polar multiplicities\nBy the regularity of p, it follows that \u03bcp ((f\u03b5,d )|l=0 ) = \u03bc\u22d4r . In local coordinates at the\nregular point p the germ of the singular locus \u03a3r is a line and the restriction to \u03a3r of\nthe map \u03c8 is one-to-one. The germ at \u03c8(p) of the image \u2206 := \u03c8(\u03a3r ) is parametrised\nby (l, \u03b5ld ) since f\u03b5,d = fd + \u03b5ld and \u03a3r \u2282 {fd = 0}. This multiplicity is represented in\nFigure 1 by the number of intersection points of {f\u03b5,d = \u03b7} with the curve \u2206. Therefore\nmultp (\u03a3r , {f\u03b5,d = 0}) = mult\u03c8(p) (\u2206, {v = 0}) = d, where (u, v) are the coordinates of the\ntarget (C2 , 0). Then formula (4) becomes:\n\u03bcp (f\u03b5,d) = (d \u2212 1)\u03bc\u22d4r + multp (\u0393\u0302p (l, f\u03b5,d), {f\u03b5,d = 0}).\n\n(5)\n\nWe next need to sum up over all the points p \u2208 \u03a3\u221e\nf \u2229 {l = 0}. The number of points of\n\u03a3r \u2229 {l = 0} is equal to the degree dr := deg \u03a3r and we get:\nX\nX\nX X\n(6)\n\u03bcp (f\u03b5,d ) = (d \u2212 1)\ndr \u03bc\u22d4r +\nmultp (\u0393\u0302p (l, f\u03b5,d ), {f\u03b5,d = 0}),\nr\n\np\u2208\u03a3\u221e\nf \u2229{l=0}\n\nhence\n(7)\n\nX\n\nr\n\np\u2208\u03a3r \u2229{l=0}\n\n\u03bcp (f\u03b5,d ) \u2265 (d \u2212 1)\n\nX\n\ndr \u03bc\u22d4r\n\nr\n\np\u2208\u03a3\u221e\nf \u2229{l=0}\n\nwith equality if and only if \u0393\u0302p (l, f\u03b5,d ) = \u2205 for all p \u2208 \u03a3\u221e\nf \u2229 {l = 0}.

The first inequality becomes an equality if and\nonly if X\u03b5 has no singularities in the neighbourhood of H \u221e . The last one becomes an\nequality if and only if r = 1 and d1 = 1.\nOur claim follows since we have \u2206n\u22121 (f ) \u2265 \u2206n\u22121 (f\u03b5 ) by the semi-continuity principle\n(1).\n\u0003\nProposition 3.5.

We may assume, by eventually adding up some appropriate constant, that the\nfibre {f = 0} contains some 1-dimensional component of the singular locus Sing f . If we\nconsider the deformation f\u03b5 = f + \u03b5l for general l then, by Lemma 3.3, f\u03b5 has isolated\n\u221e\nsingularities and \u03a3\u221e\nf\u03b5 = \u03a3f for small enough \u03b5 6= 0. We shall therefore use formula (3)\nin order to compute the top Betti defect \u2206n\u22121 (f\u03b5 ), so let us take the homogenisation of\ndegree d by the variable z:\n{f \u0303\u03b5 = f \u0303 + \u03b5lz d\u22121 = tz d } = f\u03b5\u22121 (t) \u2282 Pn .\nAs we did before, we may and shall assume that l = xn . Pick up some point p \u2208\n\u221e\nf \u22121 (0) \u2229 Sing f \u2229 H \u221e and note that p \u2208 \u03a3\u221e\nf = \u03a3f\u03b5 . We may assume that p 6\u2208 {xn = 0}\nand more specifically that p = [0; 0 * * * ; 0; 1]. In the chart xn = 1 the function f reads f\u02c6\nand f\u03b5\u22121 (t) is defined by the equation f\u02c6 + (\u03b5 \u2212 tz)z d\u22121 = 0; we consider its germ at the\norigin 0 of the local coordinates. By taking some (d \u2212 1)th root u = u(t, z) of the germ\n\u03b5 \u2212 tz we change z into \u1e91 = uz, which defines the same hyperplane at infinity. The local\nequation at p of the fibre f\u03b5\u22121 (0) becomes in our new coordinates:\n\u1e91\nf\u02c6(x1 , . . . , xn\u22121 , ) + \u1e91 d\u22121 = 0.\nu\nThe polar locus \u03930 (\u1e91, f\u02c6+ \u1e91 d\u22121 ) is a germ equal to the union \u03930 (f\u02c6, \u1e91) \u222aSing 0 f\u02c6. Despite the\nfact that the coordinate \u1e91 is maybe not generic in the sense of Lemma 3.1, \u03930 (\u1e91, f\u02c6) is a\ncurve or empty by Pellikaan's result [Pe1, Prop 8.5], since \u1e91 has the property Sing f\u02c6\u2229{\u1e91 =\n0} = {0}. Let Sing 0 f\u02c6 = \u222aj \u03a3j be the decomposition into irreducible components of the\ngerm and let us denote by \u03bc\u22d4j the Milnor number of the transversal singularity of \u03a3j .\nBy formula (3) of Proposition 2.4, the top Betti defect of f\u03b5 is expressed in terms of the\nboundary Milnor numbers. Each Milnor number may be expressed via the L\u00ea attaching\nformula in terms of polar multiplicity, see (4). Thus, by neglecting the contribution of\nthe branches of \u03930 (\u1e91, f\u02c6) other than Sing 0 f\u02c6, which is positive if and only if these branches\nare nonempty, we get:\nX\n(9)\n\u03bc0 (f\u02c6 + \u1e91 d\u22121 ) + \u03bc0 (f\u02c6|\u1e91=0 ) \u2265\nmult0 (\u03a3j , {f\u02c6 + \u1e91 d\u22121 = 0})\u03bc\u22d4j .\nj\n\nLet \u2206 be the image of the singular locus Sing 0 f\u02c6 under the map \u03c8 := (\u1e91, f\u02c6 + \u1e91 d\u22121 ) and\nnote that \u2206 is parametrised by (t, td\u22121 ). The multiplicity mult0 (\u03a3j ) is less or equal to\nmult0 (\u03a3j , {z = 0}) (with equality iff \u03a3j \u22d4 {z = 0}) and the later is the degree of the map\n\u03c8| : \u03a3j \u2192 \u2206. We then have mult0 (\u03a3j , {f\u02c6+ \u1e91 d\u22121 = 0}) = (d\u22121) deg0 \u03c8| \u2265 (d\u22121)mult0 (\u03a3j )\nand thus we obtain\nX\n(10)\n\u03bc0 (f\u02c6 + \u1e91 d\u22121 ) + \u03bc0 (f\u02c6|\u1e91=0 ) \u2265 (d \u2212 1)\nmult0 (\u03a3j )\u03bc\u22d4j .\nj\n\nSince this inequality holds at any point p \u2208 f \u22121 (0) \u2229 Sing f \u2229 H \u221e , we may take the\nsum over all of those in order to bound from below the top Betti defect of f\u03b5 .

Let us observe that \u03b2 \u2265\n\u03b1 \u2212 1 since if some fibre of f has a singular locus of dimension \u03b1\u2032 > 0 then it intersects\nthe hypersurface at infinity {fd = 0} and this intersection, which has dimension \u03b1\u2032 \u2212 1, is\nincluded in the singular set of {fd = 0} which is \u03a3\u221e\nf by definition.\nIf f has non-isolated singularities, i.e. (\u03b1, \u03b2) > (0, 0) then, by applying Lemmas 3.2 and\n3.3, we deform f until we arrive at some polynomial f \u2032 which is in one of the following two\nterminal cases: (\u03b1, \u03b2) = (1, 0) or (0, 1). More precisely the strategy is as follows. If \u03b2 > 0\nthen we first apply Lemma 3.3 to get (0, \u03b2), next apply Lemma 3.2 repeatedly a number\nof (\u03b2 \u22121) times to reach the dimensions (0, 1). In case \u03b2 = 0, the above observation shows\nthat \u03b1 \u2264 1, hence we can only have (\u03b1, \u03b2) = (1, 0).\nBy the semi-continuity principle (1), we get \u2206n\u22121 (f ) \u2265 \u2206n\u22121 (f \u2032 ). Then one applies\neither Proposition 3.5 or Proposition 3.4 to conclude in both cases that \u2206n\u22121 (f \u2032 ) \u2265 d \u2212 1.\nThis shows that if \u2206n\u22121 (f ) \u2264 d \u2212 2 then (\u03b1, \u03b2) = (0, 0). Since our statement claims the\ninequality \u2264 d \u2212 1, we need an extra argument; this will be given in \u00a74.3 bellow and will\ncomplete the proof.\n4.2. Proof of Part (c). As told above, if f has non-isolated singularities then we may\ndeform f until we may apply either Proposition 3.4 or Proposition 3.5. In the first case\nwe arrive at the the inequality\nr we have either r > 1,\nP (8)\u22d4 which shows that, if for some\n\u22d4\nn\nor dr > 1, or \u03bcr > 1, then r dr \u03bcr \u2265 2 and therefore (d \u2212 1) \u2212 bn\u22121 (f\u03b5,d) \u2265 2(d \u2212 1). In\nthe second case we arrive at the the inequality (10) which yields the same conclusion.\nNow if in the first case we have r = dr = \u03bc\u03c8r = 1 then we may use Theorem 1.2,\nproved independently in \u00a76, which tells that \u2206n\u22121 (f ) \u2265 2(n \u2212 1)(d \u2212 2) + 1 and this is\ngreater than 2d \u2212 3 since n \u2265 3. This completely eliminates the first case from our range\n\u2206n\u22121 (f ) < 2d \u2212 2.\nThese arguments and the use of the range in Part (b) prove our statement. However\nwe need to complete the proof of Part (b), and this will be done in the next.\n4.3. End of the proof of Part (b). Assume first that (\u03b1, \u03b2) = (1, 0). The arguments\npresented in the above proof of Part (c) allow to deduce the following: if \u2206n\u22121 (f ) < 2d\u22122\nthen Sing f is a line with transversal type A1 intersecting H \u221e transversely. Assume\nwithout loss of generality that Sing f \u2282 f \u22121 (0). Let then {p} := Sing f \u2229 H \u221e and\nconsider the local chart at this point, which we shall denote by 0 in the following. Locally\nat 0, the compactified fibres of f have the equation f\u02c6 \u2212 tz d = 0. Let us fix a general, not\natypical value t 6= 0. We may then apply the Yomdin-L\u00ea formula like in (9) and (10), but\nthis time with d instead of d \u2212 1 and, by a completely similar computation, we get:\n(11)\n\n\u03bc0 (f\u02c6 + tz d ) + \u03bc0 (f\u02c6|z=0 ) \u2265 d.\n\nWith the same arguments as in the proof of Proposition 3.5, this shows that \u2206n\u22121 (f ) \u2265 d.\nLet's now consider the case (\u03b1, \u03b2) = (0, 1) with \u2206n\u22121 (f ) < 2d \u2212 2. From the inequality\n(8) at the end of the proof of Proposition 3.4 we deduce that \u03a3\u221e\nf is a reduced projective\nline with generic transversal type A1 . Note that, since the singular locus \u03a3\u221e\nf of {fd = 0}\nis a line in Pn\u22121 , one must have n \u2265 3 and d \u2265 2. This situation is treated in Theorem\n\n\fBETTI BOUNDS OF POLYNOMIALS\n\n11\n\n1.2. This result, proved independently in \u00a76, tells that for such polynomials the top Betti\ndefect is \u2265 2(n \u2212 1)(d \u2212 2) + 1 > 2d \u2212 3.\n4.4. Proof of Part (a). If f is general-at-infinity then f has at most isolated singularn\nities and \u03a3\u221e\nf = \u2205 by definition. One applies formula (3) to get bn\u22121 (f ) = (d \u2212 1) , since\nall the involved Milnor numbers are zero. This fact has already been observed in [ST2].\nLet us now prove the reciprocal with help of the above results. If the polynomial f\nis not general-at-infinity then \u03a3\u221e\nf 6= \u2205, and this implies in particular that d = deg f is\ngreater than 1. If dim Sing f \u2264 0 and \u03a3\u221e\nf is a set of isolated points then we may use\nformula (3), in which there occurs at least one non-zero Milnor number, to conclude that\nthe defect \u2206n\u22121 (f ) \u2265 1. In case the singularities are non-isolated we use the above partial\nproof of part (b) of our theorem to conclude that \u2206n\u22121 (f ) \u2265 d \u2212 1 > 0.\n\u0003\n5. Euler characteristic of projective hypersurfaces with\none-dimensional singularities\nWe develop here a new method for computing the Euler characteristic of a projective\nhypersurface with non-isolated singularity. We abute to a general result, Theorem 5.3.\nWe shall use its Corollary 5.4 to build the proof of Theorem 1.2 in \u00a76.\nLet V := {fd = 0} denote a hypersurface in Pn\u22121 = H \u221e of degree d with singular\nlocus \u03a3\u0302 of dimension one, more precisely \u03a3\u0302 consists of a union \u03a3 of irreducible curves\nand eventually a finite number of points {R1 , . . . , R\u03b4 }. Let hd be a general-at-infinity\nhomogeneous polynomial of degree d and consider the deformation f\u03b5 = f + \u03b5hd . This is\ngeneral-at-infinity for \u03b5 6= 0 in some small enough disk centered at 0, by Proposition 2.2.\nFor any \u03b5 \u2208 C, let V\u03b5 := {f\u03b5,d := fd + \u03b5hd = 0} be a pencil of projective hypersurfaces.\nThe genericity of hd ensures that V\u03b5 is nonsingular for all \u03b5 6= 0 in a small enough disk\n\u2206 \u2282 C centered at the origin. Let us consider the total space of the pencil:\nV\u2206 := {fd + \u03b5hd = 0} \u2282 Pn\u22121 \u00d7 \u2206\nas germ at V0 and the projection \u03c0 : V\u2206 \u2192 \u2206. We denote by A = {fd = hd = 0} the axis\nof the pencil. One considers the polar locus of the map (hd , fd ) : Cn \u2192 C2 and since this\nis a homogeneous set one takes its image in Pn\u22121 which will be denoted by \u0393(hd , fd ).\nLet us spell out more precisely the meaning of \"general\" for hd . By using the Veronese\nembedding of degree d we find a Zariski open set O of linear functions in the target such\nthat whenever g \u2208 O then its pull-back is a general homogeneous polynomial hd defining\na hypersurface H := {hd = 0} which is transversal to V in the stratified sense, i.e. after\nendowing V with some Whitney stratification, of which the strata are as follows: the\nisolated singular points {R1 }, . . . , {R\u03b4 } of V and the point-strata {Q1 }, . . . , {Q\u03b3 } \u2282 \u03a3,\nthe components of \u03a3 \\ {Q1 , . . . , Q\u03b3 } and the open stratum V \\ \u03a3\u0302. Such hd will be called\ngeneral. This definition implies that A intersects \u03a3\u0302 at general points, in particular does\nnot contain any point Qi or Ri . Moreover:\n(12) the germ of the polar locus \u0393p (hd , fd ) \u2282 Pn\u22121 is empty at any point p \u2208 A \u00d7 {0}.\nLet us explain and prove this claim. The germ \u0393p (hd , fd ) at some point p is obtained as the\npolar locus of the localised map (\u0125d , f\u02c6d ) : Cn\u22121 \u2192 C2 obtained by dehomogenisation. At\n\n\f12\n\nDIRK SIERSMA AND MIHAI TIB\u0102R\n\nthe regular points of A = V \u2229 H the claim is due to the transversality of the hypersurfaces\nV and H. At the points of A \u2229 \u03a3, we reason as follows: locally, the hypersurface V is\ndefined as the zero locus of the localised function f\u02c6d : Cn\u22121 \u2192 C. One may suppose from\nthe beginning that the fixed Whitney stratification of V satisfies Thom condition1 (af\u02c6d ).\nSince hd was chosen general, the hypersurface H slices \u03a3\u0302 only at the 1-dimensional Thom\nstrata of V (which are included in \u03a3) and the intersection is transversal. This implies\nthat H is transversal to the limits of the tangent spaces at the fibres of fd , which means\nthat the germ of the polar locus \u0393p (\u0125d , f\u02c6d ) = \u0393p (hd , fd ) is empty, which was our claim.\n\n\u03a3\n\nQ1\n\nH\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nR2\n\nR1\nQ4\n\nP1\nP2\n\nP3\n\nP4\n\nFigure 2. Point-strata of V and the intersection H \u2229 \u03a3\nWith these preliminaries, we may prove the following:\nLemma 5.1. The space V\u2206 has isolated singularities: Sing V\u2206 = (A \u2229 \u03a3) \u00d7 {0}, and\n\u03c0 : V\u2206 \u2192 \u2206 is a map with 1-dimensional singular locus: Sing (\u03c0) = \u03a3\u0302 \u00d7 {0}.\nProof. The germ at A of the singular locus\nSing V\u2206 = {\u2202fd + \u03b5\u2202hd = 0} \u2229 A \u00d7 \u2206\nis by definition the union of the finite set A\u2229\u03a3 and the locus where the partial derivatives\n\u2202fd and \u2202hd are dependent, which is some subgerm of the polar locus \u0393A (hd , fd ) at A.\nBut, as shown above, this polar locus germ is empty for general hd .\nNext, the map \u03c0 : V\u2206 \u2192 \u2206 is a holomorphic map on a space with isolated singularities\nsuch that Sing V\u2206 \u2282 \u03a3 \u00d7 {0}. Then Sing \u03c0 = {\u2202fd + \u03b5\u2202hd = 0} may be read as the\nunion of the singularities of the hypersurfaces V\u03b5 for \u03b5 \u2208 \u2206. Now since hd is general, the\nhypersurfaces V\u03b5 are nonsingular for small enough \u03b5 6= 0, like in the proof of Proposition\n2.2. This shows that Sing \u03c0 = Sing V = \u03a3\u0302.\n\u0003\nWe shall use (or continue to use) the following notations: A \u2229 \u03a3 = {P1 , . . . , P\u03bd },\n\u03a3 := \u03a3 \\ ({Pi }\u03bdi=1 \u222a ({Qj }\u03b3j=1), N := small enough tubular neighbourhood of \u03a3\u2217 , and\nBi , Bj , Bk are small enough Milnor balls within V\u2206 \u2282 Pn\u22121 \u00d7 \u2206 at the points Pi , Qj , Rk ,\nrespectively.\n\u2217\n\n1it\n\nhas been proved that this is the case in general, see e.g. [BMM].\n\n\fBETTI BOUNDS OF POLYNOMIALS\n\n13\n\nSince the Euler characteristic \u03c7 is a constructible functor, we have the following decomposition into a sum:\n(13) \u03c7(V\u2206 , V\u03b5 ) = \u03c7(N , N \u2229V\u03b5 )+\n\n\u03bd\nX\n\n\u03c7(Bi , Bi \u2229V\u03b5 )+\n\n\u03b3\nX\n\n\u03c7(Bj , Bj \u2229V\u03b5 )+\n\nj=1\n\ni=1\n\n\u03b4\nX\n\n\u03c7(Bk , Bk \u2229V\u03b5 )\n\nk=1\n\nThe pair (B, B \u2229 V\u03b5 ) in all of the above three sums represents the local Milnor data\nof a hypersurface germ of dimension n \u2212 2 in a space of dimension n \u2212 1. The last one\n(Bk , Bk \u2229 V\u03b5 ) corresponds to the isolated hypersurface singularity of V at Rk with Milnor\nnumber \u03bck \u2265 1, of which \u03c0 is a smoothing, and therefore we have:\n\u03c7(Bk , Bk \u2229 V\u03b5 ) = (\u22121)n\u22121 \u03bck\nFor the first term, since the map \u03c0 : V\u2206 \u2192 \u2206 has a trivial transversal structure along\n\u03a3\u2217r , where \u03a3r is some irreducible component in the decomposition of \u03a3, we have the\nequality:\nX\n\u03c7(N , N \u2229 V\u03b5 ) =\n\u03c7(\u03a3\u2217r )\u03c7(Br , Fr\u22d4).\nr\n\nwhere\nis the transversal Milnor data at some point of \u03a3\u2217r , namely Br is a Milnor\nball of the transversal singularity and Fr\u22d4 is the corresponding transversal Milnor fibre.\nNote that this is the Milnor data of an isolated hypersurface singularity of dimension\nn \u2212 3; its Milnor number will be denoted by \u03bc\u22d4r and this does not depend on the choice\nof the point on \u03a3\u2217r . We therefore have: \u03c7(Br , Fr\u22d4 ) = (\u22121)n\u22122 \u03bc\u22d4r .\nWe also have \u03c7(\u03a3\u2217r ) = 2 \u2212 2gr \u2212 \u03bdr \u2212 \u03b3r where gr is the genus of \u03a3r , and where \u03bdr and\n\u03b3r are the numbers of points Pi and Qj on \u03a3r , respectively. Then:\nX\n(14)\n\u03c7(N , N \u2229 V\u03b5 ) = (\u22121)n\u22121\n(\u03bdr + \u03b3r + 2gr \u2212 2)\u03bc\u22d4r .\n(Br , Fr\u22d4 )\n\nr\n\nLet us show that the contribution of the axis in the formula (13) is null.\nLemma 5.2. \u03c7(Bi , Bi \u2229 V\u03b5 ) = 0.\nProof. Let p \u2208 A \u2229 \u03a3 be the center of the Milnor ball Bi . Consider the map (\u03c0, hd ) :\nBi \u2192 \u2206 \u00d7 \u2206\u2032 . Consider the germ of the polar locus of this map at p, denoted by\n\u0393(\u03c0, hd ). Then it follows from the definition of the polar locus that some point (x, \u03b5) \u2208 V\u2206 ,\nwhere \u03b5 = \u2212fd (x)/hd (x), is contained in \u0393(\u03c0, hd ) \\ ({fd = 0} \u222a {hd = 0}) if and only if\nx \u2208 \u0393(fd , hd ) \\ ({fd = 0} \u222a {hd = 0}). But we have shown in (12) that \u0393(fd , hd ) is empty\nat p. The absence of the polar locus implies that Bi \u2229 V\u03b5 is homotopy equivalent (by\ndeformation retraction) to the space Bi \u2229 V\u03b5 \u2229 {hd = 0}. The latter is the slice by \u03b5 =\nconstant of the space V \u2229 {hd = 0} = {fd = 0} \u00d7 \u2206, which is a product space. Since this\nis homeomorphic to the complex link of this space and a product space has contractible\ncomplex link, we deduce that Bi \u2229 V\u03b5 is contractible too. Since Bi is contractible itself,\nwe get our claim.\n\u0003\nLet V\u03b5 := {fd + \u03b5hd = 0} be the general pencil considered above, \u03b5 6= 0 \u2208 \u2206. We have\n\u03c7(V\u2206 , V\u03b5 ) = \u03c7(V ) \u2212 \u03c7n\u22121,d since V\u03b5 is a general hypersurface of degree d in Pn\u22121 and since\nV\u2206 retracts to its central fibre V = {fd = 0}. Then the preceding considerations prove\nthe following:\n\n\f14\n\nDIRK SIERSMA AND MIHAI TIB\u0102R\n\nTheorem 5.3. Let V := {fd = 0} \u2282 Pn\u22121 be a hypersurface of degree d where Sing V is\na union of curves and isolated points.

We are considering the deformation f\u03b5 = f + \u03b5hd , where hd is a general-atinfinity homogeneous polynomial of degree d. By Proposition 2.2, f\u03b5 is a general-atinfinity polynomial for \u03b5 6= 0. In the notations of Proposition 2.4, \u2206\u03c7\u221e = \u03c7(V\u2206 , V\u03b5 ).\nThen Theorem 5.3 reads:\nCorollary 5.4.

One\nmay compute it in particular cases, as we show in the following section.\n6. Polynomials with line singularities at infinity\nA natural class of polynomials is the one where \u03a3\u221e\nf is a reduced line with Morse\ngeneric transversal type. Indeed, by the proof of Proposition 3.4, if the top Betti defect\nof f is between d and 2d \u2212 3, then f might have such type of singularities. We prove\nhere Theorem 1.2, namely that if f has at most isolated affine singularities and \u03a3\u221e\nf is a\nreduced projective line with Morse generic transversal then \u2206n\u22121 (f ) \u2265 2(n \u2212 1)(d \u2212 2) + 1.\nAs remarked in \u00a74.3, the existence of such singularities implies n \u2265 3. For n = 3 our\nformula reads: \u2206n\u22121 (f ) \u2265 4d \u2212 7 which shows that our result specialises to the estimation\nproved in [ALM] for a particular class of polynomials in 3 variables, with dim Sing f \u2264 0\nand dim \u03a3\u221e\nf = 1, and with no singularities at infinity in the sense of [ST1].\nProof of Theorem 1.2. By eventually deforming the d \u2212 1 homogeneous part of f we\nget that the intersection \u03a3 \u2229 {fd\u22121 = 0} is of dimension \u2264 0. Using the definitions in\n\u00a75 in our particular setting, we have by assumption \u03b4 = 0, r = 1, g1 = 0, \u03bc\u22d41 = 1, and\n\u03bd1 = \u03bd = mult(\u03a3, {hd = 0}) = deg hd = d. We apply formula (2) and Corollary 5.4 and\nwe get:\n(17)\n\n\u2206n\u22121 (f ) =\n\nX\np\u2208\u03a3\u221e\nf \u2229{fd\u22121 =0}\n\n\u03bcp (X0 ) + (d + \u03b3 \u2212 2) + (\u22121)\n\nn\u22121\n\n\u03b3\nX\nj=1\n\n\u03c7(Bj , Bj \u2229 V\u03b5 ).\n\n\fBETTI BOUNDS OF POLYNOMIALS\n\n15\n\nLet us first evaluate the sum of Milnor numbers of the general fibre X0 of f . For a general\nd \u2212 1 homogeneous part of f we get that the intersection \u03a3 \u2229 {fd\u22121 = 0} consists of d \u2212 1\nsimple points, each of which being an A1 singularity of X0 . This implies that the above\nfirst sum is bounded from below by d \u2212 1.\nThe number \u03b3 counts the special points Qj on the singular line \u03a3 := \u03a3\u221e\nf . Then\nthe last sum has \u03b3 terms and we need to determine for each of them the contribution\n\u03c7(Bj , Bj \u2229 V\u03b5 ). For this we need the deformation theory of line singularities, founded by\nSiersma [Si1] and subsequently developed by several authors. Let us assume without loss\nof generality that the line \u03a3 \u2282 Pn\u22121 is the zero locus of the ideal I = (x1 , . . . , xn\u22122 ). We\nremark first that the ideal of homogeneous polynomials g : (Cn , 0) \u2192 (C, 0) such that\nPn\u22122\nSing g \u2283 \u03a3 is spanned by the polynomials of the form g(x) = i,j=1\nhij (x)xi xj where\nhij (x) are polynomials depending on all variables x1 , . . . , xn . This was established in [Si1]\nand [Pe1] in the germ case; our situation is slightly different but the same proof applies.\nIn our setting the functions hij (x) are of degree \u2264 d \u22122. Following the deformation theory in [Si1], by deforming hij (x) we get a generic transversal Hessian H(x) := det(hij )i,j (x)\nand this implies that g has generic singularity type A\u221e along \u03a3. Then the point-strata\nQj are precisely the type D\u221e singularities. Following Siersma's theory [Si1], the number\nof D\u221e points is equal to the degree of the Hessian H(0, . . . , 0, xn ). In the generic case this\ndegree turns out to be equal to (d \u2212 2)(n \u2212 2). We may then take this value of \u03b3 in the formula (17) as a minimum. We also get from [Si1] that the Milnor fibre of a D\u221e -singularity\nis homotopy equivalent to a (n \u2212 2)-sphere, therefore \u03c7(Bj , Bj \u2229 V\u03b5 ) = (\u22121)n\u22121 .\nFinally, putting together the lower bounds we get:\n\u2206n\u22121 (f ) \u2265 d \u2212 1 + d + 2(d \u2212 2)(n \u2212 2) \u2212 2 = 2(n \u2212 1)(d \u2212 2) + 1.\n\u0003\nRemark 6.1. The proof actually shows that whenever hij and fd\u22121 are generic we have\nthe equality \u2206n\u22121 (f ) = 2(n \u2212 1)(d \u2212 2) + 1, which means that the bound of Theorem 1.2\nis sharp for any n \u2265 3. An explicit example for n = 3 is given in \u00a71, Example 1.5.\nReferences\n[Ar1]\n\n[Ar2]\n[ALM]\n[BT]\n[BMM]\n[Br1]\n[Br2]\n\nV.I.
