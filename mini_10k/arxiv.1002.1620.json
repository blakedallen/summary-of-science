We find a general solution to the unique 7th order ODE admitting ten dimensional group of contact symmetries. The integral curves of this ODE are rational contact\ncurves in P3 which give rise to rational plane curves of degree six. The moduli space of\nthese curves is a real form of the homogeneous space Sp(4)/SL(2).\n\nThe 7th order ODE\n10(y (3) )3 y (7) \u221270(y (3) )2 y (4) y (6) \u221249(y (3) )2 (y (5) )2 +280(y (3) )(y (4) )2 y (5) \u2212175(y (4) )4 = 0, (1)\nwhere y = y(x) and y (k) = dk y/dxk has recently appeared explicitly [12, 11, 4, 6] or\nimplicitly [1] in several different contexts. It is the unique (up to contact transformations)\nequation admitting ten\u2013dimensional algebra of contact symmetries [12], and the aim of this\nnote is to show that its general solution is given by a degree six rational curve of the form\ny 3 + \u03b1(x)y 2 + \u03b2(x)y + \u03b3(x) = 0,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) are a quadratic, a quartic, and a sextic respectively with the coefficients\ndepending on seven parameters as in formula (13).\nIn fact the symmetry algebra of (1) was known to Lie [9] who also proved that this is the\nmaximal algebra of contact vector fields on the plane. It is quite possible that equation (1)\nand its general solution were also known to Lie. We have been unable to find it in any of\nLie's works , but we would be grateful to hear from anyone who has (the earliest reference\nto the equation - but not its solution - we are aware of is [10]).\nContact Lie algebras. Let U \u2282 R2 be an open set and let P(T \u2217 U ) be a projectivised\ncotangent bundle with a contact one\u2013form \u03c9. A curve \u03b3 \u2282 P(T U ) is called contact if\n\u03c9|\u03b3 = 0. A contact transformation is a map f : P(T U ) \u2192 P(T U ) which takes contact\ncurves into contact curves. Equivalently f \u2217 (\u03c9) = \u03bb\u03c9 for some function \u03bb. Let (x, y) be\nthe local coordinates on U and let z parametrise the fibers of P(T U ), so that we can set\n\u03c9 = dy \u2212 zdx. Consider a one parameter group of contact transformations. Close to the\nidentity, this is characterised by a contact vector field X such that the contact condition\nLX \u03c9 = c\u03c9 holds, where LX = d(X ) + X d is the Lie derivative and c is some function.\nThe contact condition implies that locally there exist a function H = H(x, y, z) such that\nXH = \u2212(\u2202z H)\u2202x + (H \u2212 z\u2202z H)\u2202y + (\u2202x H + z\u2202y H)\u2202z .\n\n(3)\n\nIf H = a(x, y) + zb(x, y) then XH generates a prolongation of a family of point transformations f : U \u2192 U . Otherwise it generates a proper contact flow.\nThe symmetry. A remarkable result of Lie is that a maximum dimension of a Lie algebra\nof proper contact vector fields on the plane is ten. This maximal, ten\u2013dimensional Lie\nalgebra is generated by vector fields (3) corresponding to functions\n1, x, x2 , y, z, xz, x2 z \u2212 2xy, z 2 , 2yz \u2212 xz 2 , 4xyz \u2212 4y 2 \u2212 x2 z 2 .\n\n(4)\n\nThis algebra is isomorphic to so(5), or equivalently to sp(4) (this is, up to a choice of the\nreal form, the maximal subalgebra of the 11 dimensional symmetry algebra of the trivial\nDate: February, 2011.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nMACIEJ DUNAJSKI AND VLADIMIR SOKOLOV\n\n7th order ODE). The first seven generators correspond to prolonged point vector fields and\nthe last three are the proper contact vector fields.\nThe algebra (4) generates all contact symmetries of equation (1): if y(x) is a solution to\n(1) then so is \u1ef9(x\u0303), where\nx\u0303 = x\u0303(x, y, z, ci ),\n\n\u1ef9 = \u1ef9(x, y, z, ci ),\n\nz\u0303 = z\u0303(x, y, z, ci ) =\n\n\u2202x \u1ef9 + z\u2202y \u1ef9\n,\n\u2202x x\u0303 + z\u2202y x\u0303\n\n\u2202z \u1ef9 = z\u0303\u2202z x\u0303\n\nis the contact transformation generated by the vector fields (3) and c1 , . . . , c10 are parameters of this transformation. Equivalently, any of the generators (4) satisfies the linearisation\nof (1) when z = y \u2032 .\nAnother result of Lie [9] is that a maximal dimension of the contact symmetry algebra of\nan ODE of order n > 3 is (n + 4), with maximal symmetry occurring if only if the ODE is\ncontact equivalent to a trivial equation y (n) = 0. Therefore equation (1) is of submaximal\ntype [11] - it is not equivalent to the trivial equation and its symmetry algebra has the\nlargest possible dimension. Up to the contact equivalence (1) is the unique 7th order ODE\nwith this property.\nThe solution. We verify that the algebraic curve y 2 + x(x \u2212 1)3 = 0 solves (1). This curve\nis parametrised by\nt3\n1\n, y(t) = \u2212 2\n.\n(5)\nx(t) = 2\nt +1\n(t + 1)2\nThe 7\u2013dimensional subalgebra of (4) consisting of prolonged point symmetries integrates\nto\nx\ny\n, x\u2192\n.

Moreover p has multiplicity m if all (m \u2212 1)st\nderivatives of f vanish at p but at least one mth derivative does not. A singular point is\ncalled ordinary if the tangents to all branches at the point are distinct. Any singular point\ncharacterised by a triple of integers (m, \u03b4, r), where m is the multiplicity, r is the number\nof branches and \u03b4 is the number of multiplicity two ordinary singular points concentrating\nat p. The arithmetic genus of a curve is given by\n(d \u2212 1)(d \u2212 2) X\n\u2212\n\u03b4,\ng=\n2\n\n\fON THE 7TH ORDER ODE WITH SUBMAXIMAL SYMMETRY\n\n3\n\nwhere d is the degree of the curve, and the summation is taken over all singular points.\nThe curves in the family (8) have two singularities: a cusp of type (2, 1, 1) at (x, y) =\n(x0 , \u2212Q(x0 )), where x0 is the triple root of P and a point at \u221e of type (2, 2, 2). Calculating\nthe genus of curves in this family yields\ng=\n\n3*2\n\u2212 1 \u2212 2 = 0.\n2\n\nTherefore the family is rational. Applying the point transformations in (6) to the parametrisation (5) and redefining the constants c1 , . . . , c6 we find that the rational parametrisation\nis given by\nx(t) =\n\nb5 + b6 t 2\n,\nb0 + t 2\n\ny(t) =\n\nb4 t4 + b3 t2 + b2 t + b1\n.\n(b0 + t2 )2\n\nThe six parameters in (8) are algebraic expressions in the seven parameters (b0 , . . . , b6 ) one\nof which is irrelevant and arises only in the parametrisation.\nThe family of curves (8) can also be obtained applying H9 and the point transformations\nto the trivial solution y = x2 . It is not the general solution to (1) as it depends on six\nparameters rather than seven. To introduce the additional parameter, and construct the\ngeneral solution we use the contact transformation (7) generated by (3) with H8 = z 2\nx\u0303(t) = x(t) \u2212 2bz(t),\n\n\u1ef9(t) = y(t) \u2212 bz(t)2 ,\n\nz\u0303(t) = z(t),\n\n(9)\n\nwhere\nz(t) =\n\n(4b4 b0 \u2212 2b3 )t3 \u2212 3b2 t2 + (2b3 b0 \u2212 4b1 )t + b2 b0\n\u1e8f(t)\n=\n,\n\u1e8b(t)\n2(b5 \u2212 b0 b6 )(b0 t + t3 )\n\nand (b, b0 , . . . , b6 ) are constant parameters. The relation (9) gives a seven\u2013dimensional\nfamily of rational contact curves in P3 . The connected component of the symplectic group\nSp(4) acts on P3 and preserves the family (9). The symmetry group of any fixed rational\ncurve in this family is SL(2), and so the seven\u2013dimensional space of solutions to (1) is\nthe symmetric space Sp(4)/SL(2). In the holomorphic category, a rational curve in P3\ncan be characterised by a normal bundle, which in our case is N = O(5) \u2295 O(5). The\ncontact modification of the Kodaira theorem described in [2] can be applied to deduce that\nwe have constructed a complete analytic family of contact curves: an infinitesimal contact\ndeformation of any fixed curve in the family (9) also belongs to this family.\nAlternatively, the general solution to (1) can be given by an implicit relation\nu(x, y, z) = 0,\n\nv(x, y, z) = 0\n\n(10)\n\nwhere (x, y, z) are coordinates on an open set in P3 . Using (8) and (9) we find\nu = (y + bz 2 + Q(X))2 + P (X),\n\nv = 4P (z + Q\u2032 )2 + (P \u2032 )2\n\nwhere Q = Q(X) is a quadratic, P = P (X) is a quartic with one simple and one triple\nroot, and X = x + 2bz. To find an explicit formula for y(x) pick a real root z of the cubic\nv = 0, substitute this in u = 0 and solve the resulting quadratic for y. Alternatively we\nuse the resultant to produce a planar curve birationaly equivalent to (10) by eliminating z\nbetween u and v. Recall [7] that a resultant of two polynomials\nu(z) = u0 + u1 z + * * * + um z m ,\n\nv(z) = v0 + v1 z + * * * + vn z n\n\n\f4\n\nMACIEJ DUNAJSKI AND VLADIMIR SOKOLOV\n\nFigure 1.

Only one\nof the roots satisfies z = y \u2032 ).\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n64 b + 1024 b3 y 3 + 768 b2 + 16 x2 \u2212 768 xb2 + 288 b2 y 2\n\u0001\n+ 264 x2 b \u2212 108 b3 + 192 x4 b \u2212 72 xb \u2212 384 x3 b y\n(11)\n\u0001\n4\n2\n2\n3\n2 2\n5\n6\n+ 48 x \u2212 27 b + 54 xb \u2212 16 x \u2212 27 x b \u2212 48 x + 16 x = 0.\nThis curve does not belong to the class (8): it has two (2, 1, 1) cusps and one non-ordinary\n(2, 2, 2) singularity at \u221e whereas (8) has one cusp (apart from the singularity at \u221e). The\ncurve (11) possesses the following property: its discriminant is a cube of a quartic Q(x)\nin x with two real roots. These roots correspond to the positions of the finite cusps, as in\nFigure 1. For any such curve (2) the cross-ratio \u03c1 of the roots of Q is an invariant with\nrespect to transformations (6). It is possible to verify that for (11) we have \u03c1 = \u03b5, where\n2\n\u03b5 = exp ( i\u03c0\n3 ). To bring the curve (11) to a canonical form we first set the coefficient of y\n2\nto zero by a transformation of the form y \u2192 y + c1 + c2 x + c3 x . After that the remaining\nM\u00f6bius transformations can be used to set Q(x) = x(x \u2212 1)(x \u2212 \u03c1). This, up to scaling of\ny, yields\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\n1\ny 3 \u2212 3y x \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b5) x \u2212 (1 + \u03b5) x \u2212 (1 + \u03b5) x \u2212 (\u22121 + \u03b5) +\n3\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011\n2 x \u2212 (1 \u2212 i\u03b5) x \u2212 (1 + i\u03b5) x \u2212 (i \u2212 i\u03b5) x \u2212 (\u2212i + i\u03b5) x \u2212 (i + \u03b5) x \u2212 (\u2212i + \u03b5) = 0.\nThe discriminant Q(x) of this curve is proportional to x3 (x \u2212 1)3 (x \u2212 \u03b5)3 .\n\n\fON THE 7TH ORDER ODE WITH SUBMAXIMAL SYMMETRY\n\n5\n\nUsing this complex canonical form, we easily can find a real one. To do that we find\nfour roots of the sextic in x in the complex canonical form such that their cross-ratio is\n\u22121. Using the M\u00f6bius transformations, we move these roots to \u00b11 \u00b1 i. The result (up to\nscaling of x and y) is given by\ny 3 + 3(3x4 \u2212 6x2 \u2212 1)y + 12x(3x4 + 1) = 0\n\n(12)\n\nwhich can be parametrised by\nx(t) =\n\nt(t2 \u2212 3)\n,\n3(t2 + 1)\n\ny(t) = \u2212\n\n4t(t4 + 3)\n.\n3(t2 + 1)2\n\nTo get the general solution for the 7th order ODE (1) we apply the point transformations\n(6) to (12). The resulting degree six rational curve of the form (2) is given by\n\u00013\nc4 y + c1 + c2 x + c3 x2\n(13)\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0001\n+3 3 (c5 x + c6 )4 \u2212 6 (c5 x + c6 )2 (1 \u2212 c7 x)2 \u2212 (1 \u2212 c7 x)4 c4 y + c1 + c2 x + c3 x2\n\u0011\n\u0010\n+12 (c5 x + c6 ) 3 (c5 x + c6 )4 (1 \u2212 c7 x) + (1 \u2212 c7 x)5 = 0.\nThe formula (2) is the general solution as the generic initial data\n{y(0), y \u2032 (0), . . . , y (6) (0)}\ncan be chosen arbitrarily by choosing the coefficients c1 , . . . , c7 in the solutions. There exist\nadditional singular solutions corresponding to submanifolds of the initial data manifold\nwhich can not be obtained by any choice of coefficients in (13). An example of such\nsingular solution with a co\u2013dimension one initial data set is the curve (8). The leading\nterm in this curve is y 2 and this can not arise in (13). This type of behaviour should not\nbe confused with the singular orbits of the symmetry group. The connected component of\nthe group Sp(4) is transitive on the solution space, and thus (13) and (8) are related by a\ncontact transformation. This is indeed how we found (13).\nConclusions. We have found the general solution of the 7th order ODE (1). This equation\nis submaximal as its symmetry algebra is ten\u2013dimensional, wheres the algebra of the trivial\n7th order ODE is eleven\u2013dimensional. The general solution to (1) is given by the seven\ndimensional orbit of the point transformations (6) acting on the canonical solution (12).\nThere also exists a six\u2013dimensional submanifold in the space of solutions given by degree\nfour curves (8). For each contact transformations generated by H8 , H9 and H10 in (4) there\nexists a point transformation such that the composition of the two fixes (12). This gives a\nstabiliser SL(2) of (12) and finally the solution space Sp(4)/SL(2).\nThe analogous, submaximal 5th order ODE characterises conics in RP2 . In the inhomogeneous coordinates (x, y) the five parameter family of conics is\ny 2 = c1 x2 + c2 xy + c3 y + c4 x + c5 .\nEliminating the parameters (c1 , . . . , c5 ) between this equation and its fourth derivatives\nand substituting in the fifth derivative yields the ODE\n9(y (2) )2 y (5) \u2212 45y (2) y (3) y (4) + 40(y (3) )3 = 0.\nThis construction goes back to Halphen [8] who wrote the equation as ((y (2) )\u22122/3 )(3) = 0.\nThe seven\u2013dimensional space of solutions M to (1) carries a GL(2, R) structure in the\nsense of [5, 4]: T M has a pointwise identification with a vector space of homogeneous degree\nsix polynomials in two variables. The five W\u00fcnschmann\u2013Doubrov\u2013Wilczynski invariants\nvanish on the ODE (1) which implies [3] that the linearisation of (1) is equivalent to a\n\n\f6\n\nMACIEJ DUNAJSKI AND VLADIMIR SOKOLOV\n\ntrivial ODE \u03b4y (7) = 0. Moreover [6], M also admits a conformal structure of signature\n(3, 4). The null vectors of this structure correspond to the six order polynomials\na1 x6 + 6a2 x5 + 15a3 x4 + 20a4 x3 + 15a5 x2 + 6a6 x + a7\nwith vanishing quadratic invariant [7]\na1 a7 \u2212 6a2 a6 + 15a3 a5 \u2212 10a24 .\nIn [6] it was shown that the conformal structure associated to (1) contains a metric with\nweak holonomy G\u03032 : there exists a three form \u03c6 on M such that\nd\u03c6 = \u039b \u2217 \u03c6,\n\nd\u2217\u03c6=0\n\nwhere \u039b is a constant, and \u2217 is the Hodge operator. Taking an analytic continuation\nof this structure to the Riemannian signature yields the homology seven\u2013sphere M =\nSO(5)/SO(3) with its canonical weak G2 structure originally constructed by Bryant [1].\nAcknowledgements\nMD is grateful to Robert Bryant, Boris Doubrov, Michal Godli\u0144ski and Peter Olver for\nuseful correspondence.
