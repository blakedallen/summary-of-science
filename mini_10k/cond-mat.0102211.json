INTRODUCTION\n\nRecently considerable attention has been directed to the studies on correlated electrons in the present of orbital\ndegree of freedom which is relevant to transitional-metal oxides [1\u20135], C60 materials [6] and artificial quantum dot\narrays [7]. Apart from the numerical [8] and perturbative [9] works theories based on symmetries were presented\nfor one-dimensional models of these systems. An SU (4) theory describing spin systems with orbital degeneracy\nwas proposed [10,11] for a theoretical understanding of the observed unusual properties. The ground-state phase\ndiagrams for the system with a symmetry breaking of SU (4) \u2192 SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) were discussed in ref. [9,12]. For the\n2-fold orbital degenerate Hubbard model a recent paper [13] presented the SU (4) theory and showed the underlying\nSUd (4) symmetry of spin-orbital double and a charge SUc (4) symmetry with an extended Lieb-Mattis transformation\nmapping those two SU (4) generators into each other. On the basis of elementary degenerate perturbative theory, it\nwas also shown that the effective Hamiltonian is equivalent to the SO(6) and SU (4) Heisenberg models respectively\nat half-filling and quarter-filling with strong coupling. In ref. [14], the one-dimensional SU (4) Hubbard model is\nextensively studied on the basis of Bethe ansatz solution. As for the symmetry theory of one-dimensional Hubbard\nmodel without orbital degeneracy, it has been well-investigated. Yang introduced the pairing operators and so\nconstructed the symmetry SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) [15]. Based on the symmetry Fabian H.L.E\u03b2ler et. al. [16] discussed\nthe completeness of the Bethe ansatz solutions, M.Pernici [17] showed the off-diagonal long-range order, D.B.Uglov\nand V.E.Korepin presented the Yangian symmetry Y (sl(2)) \u2295 Y (sl(2)) [18], and Fabian H.L.E\u03b2ler and Holger Frahm\nconsidered the density correlations [19]. And it has been argued that the two-dimensional single-band Hubbard model\nhas approximate SO(5) symmetry [20]. But the research works on the Hubbard model with orbital degeneracy are\nstill in accumulation. In the present paper we study the symmetries of the Hubbard model of electrons with generally\nn-fold orbital degeneracy. We show and clarify that the SUd (2n) and SUc (2n) symmetries hold respectively, unlike in\nthe simple Hubbard model for which both of the two symmetries are valid, for model with unified on-site interaction\n(e)\n(o)\nand that with partly attractive interactions. But the sub-symmetry SUd (n) \u2297 SUd (n) is found both valid for the\ntwo models and for arbitrary chemical potential \u03bc. An extended Lieb-Mattis transformation as in [13] is given to\nmap these two symmetries into each other. By assuming at most two electrons on each site, on the basis of which\nthe Bethe ansatz can be applied in one-dimensional model, we find the SUd (2n) and SUc (2n) symmetries both exist\nin each kind of the two models so we have a larger symmetry SUd (2n) \u00d7 SUc (2n). Under the exclusion another\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(o)\n(o)\n(e)\n(e)\nunderlying symmetry SUc (2)P \u00d7 ... \u00d7 SUc (2)P \u2297 SUc (2)P \u00d7 ... \u00d7 SUc (2)P , which is not included in the\nSUd (2n) \u00d7 SUc (2n), is also revealed for the unified U model with \u03bc = U so that the model totally possesses the\n\u0001\u0003\n\u0001\n\u0002\n(o)\n(o)\n(e)\n(e)\nsymmetry SUd (2n) \u00d7 SUc (2n) \u00d7 SUc (2)P \u00d7 ... \u00d7 SUc (2)P \u2297 SUc (2)P \u00d7 ... \u00d7 SUc (2)P . The underlying\nsymmetry is also valid for the partially attractive model with \u03bc = \u2212U.\nConsider the n-fold orbital degenerate electrons with states\n\n1\n\n\f|1i = |1, \u2191i ,\n...,\n|2n \u2212 1i = |n, \u2191i ,\n\n|2i = |1, \u2193i ,\n|2ni = |n, \u2193i ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere in a state |l, \u03c3i l denotes the lth orbital component and \u03c3 =\u2191, \u2193 label the spin components. We start with a\ngeneral Hamiltonian with n-fold orbital degeneracy expressed by\n\u0011 XX\nX X\u0010\nX\nH=\u2212\ntxx\u2032 Ca+ (x)Ca (x\u2032 ) + t\u2217xx\u2032 Ca+ (x\u2032 )Ca (x) +\nUaa\u2032 na (x)na\u2032 (x) \u2212 \u03bc\nna (x)\n(2)\nx,x\u2032\n\na\n\nx a6=a\u2032\n\nx,a\n\nwhere Ca+ (x) creates a fermion of state |ai at site x and na (x) is the corresponding particle number operator. The\nnotation of site is not restricted to one-dimensional case.\nII. SUD (2N ) AND SUC (2N ) SYMMETRIES\n\nBesides the U (1) symmetry there exist two kinds of SU (2n) symmetries for the orbital degenerate Hubbard model.\nWe define\nX\nEss\u2032 =\nCs+ (x)Cs\u2032 (x),\nx\n\nDm = Nm \u2212 Nm+1 ,\n\nNm =\n\nX\n\n+\nCm\n(x)Cm (x),\n\n(3)\n\nx\n\nthey fulfill the commutation relations\n[Ess\u2032 , Ett\u2032 ] = \u03b4s\u2032 ,t Est\u2032 \u2212 \u03b4s,t\u2032 Ets\u2032 ,\n[Dm , Ess\u2032 ] = (\u03b4m,s \u2212 \u03b4m,s\u2032 \u2212 \u03b4m+1,s + \u03b4m+1,s\u2032 )Ess\u2032 .\n\n(4)\n\nThese operators can construct an SU (2n) Lie algebra\nSUd (2n) : {Dm ,\n\nEss\u2032 | m = 1, ..., 2n \u2212 1; 1 \u2264 s 6= s\u2032 \u2264 2n} ,\n\n(5)\n\nwith n(2n \u2212 1) of Ess\u2032 and there are totally (2n)2 \u2212 1 of generators. {Dm } forms the commuting Cardan subalgebra\nof rank 2n \u2212 1. The Es(s+1) 's are the generators related to the simple roots. For any of txx\u2032 and \u03bc, all generators of\nSUd (2n) commute with the Hamiltonian (2) with unified on-site interaction Uaa\u2032 = U , so we have SUd (2n) symmetry\nof spin-orbital double in this case.\nLet us define another set of operators\nX\n+\n+\nF\u03b12k\u22121 =\nf (x)C2k\u22121\n(x)C2k\n(x),\nx\n\nF\u03b12k =\n\nX\n\nf (x)C2k (x)C2k+1 (x),\n\nx\n\nQm =\n\n1X +\n+\n[C (x)Cm (x) + Cm+1\n(x)Cm+1 (x) \u2212 1],\n2 x m\n\n(6)\n\nwhere k = 1, ..., n, m = 1, ..., 2n \u2212 1, f (x)2 = 1, and f (x + \u03b4) = \u2212f (x) for any site x and nearest-neighbor x + \u03b4. The\nabove operators can realize another SU (2n) Lie algebra which we shall denote by SUc (2n):\n{Qm , F\u03b1 , F\u2212\u03b1 } .\n\n(7)\n\n{Qm } is the Cardan subalgebra. The F\u03b12k\u22121 and F\u03b12k are the generators related to the simple roots, other generators\nrelating to positive roots can be obtained by F\u03b1i +\u03b1j = [F\u03b1i , F\u03b1j ], the generators with negative roots will be F\u2212\u03b1 =\n(F\u03b1 )\u2020 . If we assume that the on-site coupling Uaa\u2032 = U for the states labeled by a, a\u2032 with different spin components\nwhile Uaa\u2032 = \u2212U for states with the same spin components\nUaa\u2032 = U for odd-even pair a, a\u2032 ,\nUaa\u2032 = \u2212U for odd-odd or even-even pair a, a\u2032 ,\n2\n\n(8)\n\n\fand the amplitudes txx\u2032 of odd-neighbor hopping are real and those of even-neighbor hopping are imaginary\nt\u2217xx\u2032 = txx\u2032 when x-x\u2032 is odd neighbor,\nt\u2217xx\u2032 = \u2212txx\u2032 when x-x\u2032 is even neighbor,\n\n(9)\n\nwe will have the following relations\n[H, F\u03b12k ] = 2(\u03bc \u2212 U )F\u03b12k ,\n\n[H, F\u03b12k\u22121 ] = \u22122(\u03bc \u2212 U )F\u03b12k\u22121 .\n\n(10)\n\nIf the chemical potential \u03bc = U , the Hamiltonian will commute with all the generators of SUc (2n) so the model has\nthe charge SUc (2n) symmetry.

SUD (N ) \u2297 SUD (N ) SYMMETRY\n\nUnlike in the transitional Hubbard model for which both of the two symmetries are valid for on-site attractive\nand repulsive interactions, as we can see in previous section, for the orbital-degenerate Hubbard model the SUd (2n)\nsymmetry of spin-orbital double only holds for the unified U Hubbard model with arbitrary chemical potential \u03bc\nwhereas the charge SUc (2n) symmetry merely exists in the other partly-attractive half-filled model of which the\nchemical potential is \u03bc = U . But considering that SUd (2n) and SUc (2n) share some common generators E2\u03bd,2\u03bd \u2032 and\n(e)\n(o)\nE2\u03bd\u22121,2\u03bd \u2032 \u22121 , we will find the shared sub-symmetry SUd (n) \u2297 SUd (n) yields for the two models with\n3\n\n\f(e)\n\nSUd (n) : {D2\u03bd,2\u03bd+2 , E2\u03bd \u2032 ,2\u03bd \u2032\u2032 |\u03bd \u2264 n \u2212 1, 1 \u2264 \u03bd \u2032 6= \u03bd \u2032\u2032 \u2264 n} ,\nn\no\n(o)\nSUd (n) : D2\u03bd\u22121,2\u03bd+1,E2\u03bd \u2032 \u22121,2\u03bd \u2032\u2032 \u22121 , |\u03bd \u2264 n \u2212 1, 1 \u2264 \u03bd \u2032 6= \u03bd \u2032\u2032 \u2264 n ,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere Dm,m+2 = Nm \u2212 Nm+2 . Especially, we shall illustrate that the symmetry is valid for the partially attractive\nmodel with arbitrary chemical potential \u03bc.\nP\nAs the hopping term in the Hamiltonian and the chemical potential term \u03bc x,a na (x) are SUd (2n) invariant,\nwhether the Hubbard model possesses SUd (2n) symmetry depends on the commutation relation of the on-site interacting term and the SUd (2n) generators\nh\n\u0011\ni\n\u0010 X\nX\nX\nk\n+\nEm\n,\n(x)Cm+k (x)\nUaa\u2032 na (x)na\u2032 (x) = Cm\nna\u2032 (x)Um+k,a\u2032 \u2212\nna\u2032 (x)Um,a\u2032\na6=a\u2032\n\na\u2032 6=m+k\n\n+\n\n\u0010 X\n\nna (x)Ua,m+k \u2212\n\na6=m+k\n\na\u2032 6=m\n\nX\n\n\u0011\n+\n(x)Cm+k (x)\nna (x)Ua,m Cm\n\n(17)\n\na6=m\n\nwhere\nk\nEm\n=\n\nX\n\n+\nCm\n(x)Cm+k (x).\n\nx\n\nSurely for the case of unified Uaa\u2032 = U we easily find that the above commutation vanishes so that we have the\nSUd (2n) symmetry in this case, as is obtained in the second section. Although for the partially attractive model the\nabove commutator does not go null for all k \u2032 s and consequently we do not have SUd (2n) symmetry, the case with\neven k will be an exception. From the partially attractive (8) we find for even k's\nUa,m+k = Ua,m = \u2212U,\n\u0010 X\n\na6=m+k\n\nna (x)Ua,m+k \u2212\n\nX\n\n\u0011\nna (x)Ua,m = nm (x)Um,m+k \u2212 nm+k (x)Um+k,m\n\na6=m\n\n\u0001\n= nm (x) \u2212 nm+k (x) (\u2212U ).\nThen eq.(17) becomes\nh\ni\nX\nk\nEm\n,\nUaa\u2032 na (x)na\u2032 (x)\na6=a\u2032\n\n=\n=\n\n+\nCm\n(x)Cm+k (x) nm (x) \u2212 nm+k (x) (\u2212U ) +\n\u0001\n+\n+\n\u2212Cm\n(x)Cm+k (x) + Cm\n(x)Cm+k (x) (\u2212U )\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001 +\nnm (x) \u2212 nm+k (x) Cm\n(x)Cm+k (x)(\u2212U )\n\n=0\n\n+\n+\n+\nk\nwhere we have used relations: nm Cm = Cm\nnm = 0, nm Cm\n= Cm\n, Cm nm = Cm . Em\nwith even k's and odd (or\n(o)\n(e)\n(e)\n(o)\neven) m's correspond to the SUd (n) (or SUd (n)) generators. As a result, the SUd (n) \u2297 SUd (n) generators in\n(16) commute with the Hamiltonian of the partially attractive model for any chemical potential \u03bc. Therefore the\n(e)\n(o)\nSUd (n) \u2297 SUd (n) symmetry is shared by the two models both for arbitrary \u03bc.\n\nIV. AT MOST TWO ELECTRONS ON EACH SITE\n\nThe application of Bethe ansatz method to the 1-dimensional degenerate Hubbard model is based on such an\nassumption that prevents scattering process involving three or more electrons on one site [14,21,22]. For the traditional\nHubbard model the configurations of more than two electrons on one site are excluded automatically by the Pauli\nprinciple. In the continuum limit and for small densities or U \u226b t in the lattice model, the unwanted configurations\nin degenerate Hubbard model become negligible, so the Hamiltonian with three-electron configurations excluded will\ndescribe the system well. If we exclude more than two electrons on each site, we will find that the Hamiltonian has\nboth SUd (2n) and SUc (2n) symmetries and furthermore a larger symmetry SUd (2n) \u00d7 SUc (2n). In addition, we will\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(o)\n(o)\n(e)\n(e)\nfind an underlying symmetry SUc (2)P \u00d7 ... \u00d7 SUc (2)P \u2297 SUc (2)P \u00d7 ... \u00d7 SUc (2)P .\nConsider Uaa\u2032 = U case, the Hamiltonian reads\n4\n\n\fH = \u2212t\n\nX X\n\nPCa+ (x)Ca (x\u2032 )P + U\n\n<x,x\u2032 > a\n\nXX\n\nna (x)na\u2032 (x) \u2212 \u03bc\n\nx a6=a\u2032\n\nX\n\nna (x),\n\n(18)\n\nx,a\n\nwhere < x, x\u2032 > represents the nearest neighbor sites and let us define\nX\n+\n+\nF\u03b12k\u22121 =\nexp(i\u03c0 * x)PC2k\u22121\n(x)C2k\n(x)P,\n\n(19)\n\nx\n\nF\u03b12k =\n\nX\n\nexp(i\u03c0 * x)PC2k (x)C2k+1 (x)P,\n\n(20)\n\nx\n\nwhere the operator P projects onto the subspace of states having at most two electrons on each site [22]. Other\ngenerators can be given from the F\u03b12k\u22121 and F\u03b12k as in the SUc (2n) in section II. The P operator excludes such\nterms as ns Cs+\u2032 Cs+\u2032\u2032 , Cs Cs\u2032 ns\u2032\u2032 with three different s, s\u2032 and s\u2032\u2032 so that\nXX\n[PCs+ (x)Cs+\u2032 (x)P,\nna (x\u2032 )na\u2032 (x\u2032 )] = \u22122PCs+ (x)Cs+\u2032 (x)P,\n(21)\nx\u2032 a6=a\u2032\n\nthus we have the relations similar to (10)\n[H, F\u03b12k ] = 2(\u03bc \u2212 U )F\u03b12k ,\n\n[H, F\u03b12k\u22121 ] = \u22122(\u03bc \u2212 U )F\u03b12k\u22121 .\n\n(22)\n\nSet \u03bc = U and the F\u03b12k\u22121 and F\u03b12k will commute with the H. F\u03b12k\u22121 , F\u03b12k and Ns \u2212 Ns\u2032 can generate the SUc (2n)\nsymmetry so that H has both SUd (2n) and SUc (2n) symmetries,\nSUc (2n) : {Qm ,\n\nF\u03b1 } ,\n\n(23)\n\nSUd (2n) : {Dm ,\n\nEss\u2032 } ,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere Qm = PQm P and the SUd (2n) generators are correspondingly revised to be\nEss\u2032 = PEss\u2032 P,\n\nDm = PDm P.\n\n(25)\n\nIt also can be similarly shown that both of the two symmetries hold for the P-modified model with partially attractive\nUaa\u2032 = U ,\u2212U . As the two symmetries both hold for each of the models we can construct the larger symmetry\nSUd (2n) \u00d7 SUc(2n) for each of them. If we do not exclude more than two electrons on each site, these two symmetries\nrespectively belong to different models.\nBesides SUd (2n) \u00d7 SUc (2n) there exist some less obvious symmetries.

The extended Lieb-Mattis\ntransformation (13) maps the above symmetry into itself. An revised Lieb-Mattis transformation mapping into\n5\n\n\f(e)\n\n(o)\n\nthe corresponding SUd (2)P and SUd (2)P will involve a third kind of Hamiltonians with partially attractive\nwe have the symmetry SUd (2n) \u00d7 SUc (2n) \u00d7\nU\ni\nh aa\u2032 , which differs from what we discussed before. So finally\n(o)\n(o)\n(e)\n(e)\n(SUc (2)P \u00d7 ... \u00d7 SUc (2)P ) \u2297 (SUc (2)P \u00d7 ... \u00d7 SUc (2)P ) for (18) with \u03bc = U . But for Uaa\u2032 = U , \u2212U case the\nunderlying symmetry is valid for another chemical potential. The Hamiltonian under that exclusion is\nX X\nXX\nX\nH\u2032 = \u2212\ntPCa+ (x)Ca (x\u2032 )P +\nUaa\u2032 na (x)na\u2032 (x) \u2212 \u03bc\nna (x)\n(30)\n<x,x\u2032 > a\n\nx a6=a\u2032\n\nx,a\n\nwhere the partially attractive interaction Uaa\u2032 is also defined by (8). Compared with (10) the commutation relations\nare different\n(+)\n\n(+)\n\n[H\u2032 , F2k,2k\u2032 ] = \u22122(\u03bc + U )F2k,2k\u2032 ,\n(\u2212)\n\n(\u2212)\n\n[H\u2032 , F2k,2k\u2032 ] = 2(\u03bc + U )F2k,2k\u2032 .\n\n(31)\n\n(32)\n\nThe different sign of U comes from U2k,2k\u2032 = \u2212U while in eq.(10) it's U2k,2k\u00b11 = U . Therefore the symmetry\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(o)\n(o)\n(e)\n(e)\nSUc (2)P \u00d7 ... \u00d7 SUc (2)P \u2297 SUc (2)P \u00d7 ... \u00d7 SUc (2)P holds for \u03bc = \u2212U . It should be noted the symmetry is\nvalid under the exclusion, without the P-exclusion its generators will commute with neither of the two kinds of models.\n(o)\n(e)\n(o)\nAnd unlike SUd (n) \u2297 SUd (n) \u2282 SUd (2n) in section III, none of the SUc (2)P or SUce (2) is any sub-symmetry of\nSUc (2n).\nConsidering the commutations F\u03b12k and Ess\u2032 , we have\n(ss\u2032 )\n\n[SUd\n(ss\u2032 )\n\n[SUd\n\n\u2032\u2032 \u2032\u2032\u2032\n\n(2), SUc(s\n\ns\n\n)\n\n\u2032\n\n(2), SUc(ss ) (2)] = 0\n\n(2)] = 0, for seperate pairs (ss\u2032 ) and (s\u2032\u2032 s\u2032\u2032\u2032 ),\n\n(33)\n(34)\n\nbut\n\u0002\n(ss\u2032 )\n\n(ss\u2032 )\n\nSUd\n\n\u0003\n\u2032 \u2032\u2032\n(2), SUc(s s ) (2) 6= 0,\n\n(ss\u2032 )\n\nwhere SUd (2) and SUc (2) are sub-symmetries involving only the states s and s\u2032 . The whole symmetry cannot\nbe written in a direct product SUd (2n) \u2297 SUc (2n) but SUd (2n) \u00d7 SUc (2n). This is also a difference from the\nsingle band Hubbard model of which the symmetry in our notation is a direct product of the two SU (2)'s: i.e.,\nSO(4) \u2243 SUd (2) \u2297 SUc (2). Therefore for the one-dimensional model (18) which can be solved by the Bethe ansatz\n[22], the discussion on the completeness of the Bethe ansatz solution and the off-diagonal long-range order will be\nexpected quite different since in the single band case it's based on the vanishing commuation of the SUd (2) and\nSUc (2).\nV. BRIEF SUMMARY\n\nIn summary, we studied the symmetries of the Hubbard model of n-fold orbital degenerate electrons. We show and\nclarify that the SUd (2n) and SUc (2n) symmetries hold respectively for the model with unified on-site interaction and\nthat with partly attractive interactions. An extended Lieb-Mattis transformation is given to map these two symmetries\n(e)\n(o)\ninto each other. But the sub-symmetry SUd (n) \u2297 SUd (n) is found to be possessed by the two models and both\nfor arbitrary chemical potential \u03bc. By excluding more than two electrons on the same sites we find the SUd (2n) and\nSUc (2n) symmetries both exist in each kind of the two models, so we have an enlarged symmetry SUd (2n) \u00d7 SUc (2n).\n(e)\n(e)\n(o)\n(o)\nUnder this exclusion, another underlying symmetry (SUc (2)P \u00d7 ... \u00d7 SUc (2)P ) \u2297 (SUc (2)P \u00d7 ... \u00d7 SUc (2)P ) is\nalso found for the unified\nh U model with chemical potential \u03bc = U , and consequentlyi this model has the symmetry\n(o)\n(o)\n(e)\n(e)\nSUd (2n) \u00d7 SUc (2n) \u00d7 (SUc (2)P \u00d7 ... \u00d7 SUc (2)P ) \u2297 (SUc (2)P \u00d7 ... \u00d7 SUc (2)P ) . The underlying symmetry is\nvalid for the partially attractive model with chemical potential \u03bc = \u2212U.\n\n6\n\n\fVI.
