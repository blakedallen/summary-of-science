Particularly fruitful-both for information on real solutions\nand for applicability-are systems whose additional structure comes from geometry. Such\nequations from geometry for which we have information about their real solutions are the\nsubject of these notes.\nWe will focus on equations from toric varieties and homogeneous spaces, particularly\nGrassmannians. Not only is much known in these cases, but they encompass some of the\nmost common applications. The results we discuss may be grouped into three themes:\n(I) Upper bounds on the number of real solutions.\n(II) Geometric problems that can have all solutions be real.\n(III) Lower bounds on the number of real solutions.\nUpper bounds as in (I) bound the complexity of the set of real solutions-they are one\nof the sources for the theory of o-minimal structures which are an important topic in real\nalgebraic geometry. The existence (II) of geometric problems that can have all solutions be\nreal was initially surprising, but this phenomena now appears ubiquitous. Lower bounds as\nin (III) give an existence proof for real solutions. Their most spectacular manifestation is\nthe nontriviality of the Welschinger invariant, which was computed via tropical geometry.\nOne of the most surprising manifestations of this phenomenon is when the upper bound\nequals the lower bound, which is the subject of the Shapiro conjecture.\nI thank the Institut Henri Poincar\u00e9, where a preliminary version of these notes were\nproduced during a course I taught there in November 2005. These notes were revised and\nexpanded during course at Texas A&M University in 2007 and a lecture series at the Centre\nInterfacultaire Bernoulli at EPFL in 2008, and completed in 2010 with material from a\nlecture I gave in January 20-09 the Theorem of Mukhin, Tarasov, and Varchenko, and\nlectures at the GAeL meeting in Leiden in June 2009.

Such systems that arise naturally typically\npossess some geometric or combinatorial structure that may be exploited to study their solutions. Such structured systems are studied in enumerative algebraic geometry, which has\ngiven us the deep and powerful tools of intersection theory [39] to count and analyze their\ncomplex solutions. A companion to this theoretical work are algorithms, both symbolic\n(based on Gr\u00f6bner bases [22, 122]) and numerical (based on homotopy continuation [104])\nfor solving and analyzing systems of polynomial equations.\nDespite these successes, this line of research largely sidesteps the often primary goal of\nformulating problems as solutions to systems of equations-namely to determine or study\ntheir real solutions. This deficiency is particularly acute in applications, from control [17],\nKinematics [15], statistics [87], and computational biology [85], for it is typically the real\nsolutions that applications seek. One reason that traditional algebraic geometry ignores the\nreal solutions is that there are few elegant theorems or general results available to study real\nsolutions. Nevertheless, the demonstrated importance of understanding the real solutions\nto systems of equations demands our attention.\nIn the 19th century and earlier, many elegant and powerful methods were developed to\nstudy the real roots of univariate polynomials (Sturm sequences, Budan-Fourier Theorem,\nRouth-Hurwitz criterion), which are now standard tools in some applications of mathematics.\nIn contrast, it has only been in the pat few decades that serious attention has been paid\ntoward understanding the real solutions to systems of polynomial equations.\nThis work has concentrated on systems possessing some, particularly geometric, structure. The reason for this is two-fold: systems from nature typically possess some special\nstructure that should be exploited in their study, and it is unlikely that any results of substance hold for general or unstructured systems. In this period, a story has emerged of\nbounds (both upper and lower) on the number of real solutions to certain classes of systems, as well as the discovery and study of systems that have only real solutions. This\nOverview will sketch this emerging landscape and the subsequent chapters will treat these\ndevelopments in more detail.\n\nIntroduction\nOur goal will be to say something meaningful about the real solutions to a system of equations. For example, consider a system\nf1 (x1 , . . . , xn ) = f2 (x1 , . . . , xn ) = * * * = fN (x1 , . . . , xn ) = 0 ,\n1\n\n(1.1)\n\n\fof N real polynomials in n variables. Let r be its number of real solutions and d its number\nof complex solutions\u2020 . Since every real number is complex, and since nonreal solutions come\nin conjugate pairs, we have the following trivial inequality\nd \u2265 r \u2265 d mod 2 \u2208 {0, 1} .\nWe can say nothing more unless the equations have some structure, and a particularly\nfruitful class of structures are those which come from geometry. The main point of this\nbook is that we can identify structures in equations that will allow us to do better than this\ntrivial inequality.\nOur discussion will have three themes:\n(I) Sometimes, the upper bound d is not sharp and there is a smaller bound for r.\n(II) For many problems from enumerative geometry, the upper bound is sharp.\n(III) The lower bound for r may be significantly larger than d mod 2.\nA lot of time will be spent on the Shapiro Conjecture (Theorem of Mukhin, Tarasov, and\nVarchenko [81]) and its generalizations, which is a situation where the upper bound of d is\nalso the lower bound-all solutions to our system are real.\nWe will not describe how to actually find the solutions to a system (1.1) and there will\nbe no discussion of algorithms nor any complexity analysis. The book of Basu, Pollack, and\nRoy [2] is an excellent place to learn about algorithms for computing real algebraic varieties\nand finding real solutions. We remark that some of the techniques we employ to study real\nsolutions underlie numerical algorithms to compute the solutions.\nOne class of systems that we will study are systems of sparse polynomials. Integer vectors\na = (a1 , . . . , an ) \u2208 Zn are exponents for (Laurent) monomials\n\u22121\nZn \u220b a \u2194 xa := xa11 xa22 * * * xann \u2208 C[x1 , . . . , xn , x\u22121\n1 , . . . , xn ] .\n\nSometimes, we will just call elements of Zn monomials. Let A \u2282 Zn be a finite set of\nmonomials. A linear combination\nX\nf =\nca xa\nca \u2208 R\na\u2208A\n\nof monomials from A is a sparse polynomial with support A. Sparse polynomials naturally\ndefine functions on the complex torus (C\u00d7 )n . A system (1.1) of N = n polynomials in n\nvariables, where each polynomial has support A, will be called a system (of polynomials)\nwith support A. These are often called unmixed systems in contrast to mixed systems\nwhere each polynomial may have different support. While sparse systems occur naturally-\nmultilinear or multihomogeneous polynomials are an example-they also occur in problem\n\u2020\n\nWe shall always assume that our systems are generic in the sense that all of their solutions occur with\nmultiplicity 1, and the number d of complex solutions is stable under certain allowed perturbations of the\ncoefficients.\n\n2\n\n\fformulations for the simple reason that we humans seek simple formulations of problems,\nand this may mean polynomials with few terms.\nA fundamental result about unmixed systems is the Kushnirenko bound on their number\nof complex solutions. The Newton polytope of a polynomial with support A is the convex\nhull \u2206A of the set A of monomials. Write vol(\u2206) for the Euclidean volume of a polytope \u2206.\nTheorem 1.1 (Kushnirenko [6]) A system of n polynomials in n variables with common\nsupport A has at most n!vol(\u2206A ) isolated solutions in (C\u00d7 )n , and exactly this number when\nthe polynomials are generic polynomials with support A.\nBernstein generalized this to mixed systems. The Minkowski sum P +Q of two polytopes\nin Rn is their pointwise sum as sets of vectors in Rn . Let P1 , . . . , Pn \u2282 Rn be polytopes.\nThe volume\nvol(t1 P1 + t2 P2 + * * * + tn Pn )\nis a homogeneous polynomial of degree n in the variables t1 , . . . , tn [47, Exercise 15.2.6]. The\nmixed volume MV(P1 , . . . , Pn ) of P1 , . . . , Pn is the coefficient of the monomial t1 t2 * * * tn in\nthis polynomial.\n\nTheorem 1.2 (Bernstein [7]) A system of n polynomials in n variables where the polynomials have supports A1 , . . . , An has at most MV(\u2206A1 , . . . , \u2206An ) isolated solutions in (C\u00d7 )n ,\nand exactly this number when the polynomials are generic for their given support.\nSince MV(P1 , . . . , Pn ) = n!vol(P ) when P1 = * * * = Pn = P , this generalizes Kushnirenko's Theorem. We will prove Kushnirenko's Theorem in Chapter 3, but will not present\na proof of Bernstein's Theorem. Instead, we suggest two excellent sources by Sturmfels. Both\nare similar, but the first is self-contained and superbly written.\n\u2022 [123] Polynomial equations and convex polytopes, Amer. Math. Monthly 105 (1998),\nno. 10, 907\u2013922.\n\u2022 [124] Chapter 3 in Solving systems of polynomial equations, CBMS, vol. 97, American\nMathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2002.\nThe bound of Theorem 1.1 and its generalization Theorem 1.2 is often called the BKK\nbound for Bernstein, Khovanskii, and Kushnirenko [6].\n\n1.1\n\nUpper bounds\n\nWhile the number of complex roots of a univariate polynomial is typically equal to its degree,\nthe number of real roots depends upon the length of the expression for the polynomial.\nIndeed, by Descartes's rule of signs [24] (see Section 2.1), a univariate polynomial with m+1\nterms has at most m positive roots, and thus at most 2m nonzero real roots. For example,\nthe polynomial xd \u2212 a with a 6= 0 has 0, 1, or 2 real roots, but always has d complex\nroots. Khovanskii generalized this type of a bound to multivariate polynomials with his\nfundamental fewnomial bound.\n3\n\n\fTheorem 1.3 (Khovanskii [65]) A system of n polynomials in n variables having a total\nof l+n+1 distinct monomials has at most\n2(\n\n) (n + 1)l+n\n\nl+n\n2\n\nnondegenerate positive real solutions.\nThere are two reasons for this restriction to positive solutions. Most fundamentally is\nthat Khovanskii's proof requires this restriction. This restriction also excludes the following\ntype of trivial zeroes: Under the substitution xi 7\u2192 x2i , each positive solution becomes 2n\nreal solutions, one in each of the 2n orthants. More subtle substitutions lead to similar extra\ntrivial zeroes which differ from the positive solutions only by some sign patterns.\nThis is the first of many results which verified the principle of Bernstein and Kushnirenko\nthat the topological complexity of a set defined by real polynomials should depend on the\nnumber of terms in the polynomials and not on their degree. Khovanskii's work was also a\nmotivation for the notion of o-minimal structures [128, 86]. The main point of Khovanskii's\ntheorem is the existence of such a bound and not the actual bound itself. For each l, n \u2265 1,\nwe define the Khovanskii number X(l, n) to be the maximum number of nondegenerate\npositive solutions to a system of n polynomials in n variables with l + n + 1 monomials.\nKhovanskii's Theorem gives a bound for X(l, n), but that bound is enormous. For example,\nwhen l = n = 2, the bound is 5184. Because of this, it was expected to be far from sharp.\nDespite this expectation, the first nontrivial improvement was only given in 2003.\nTheorem 1.4 (Li, Rojas, and Wang [74]) Two trinomials in two variables have at most\n5 nondegenerate positive real solutions.\nThis bound sharp. Haas [48] had shown that the system of two trinomials in x and y\n10x106 + 11y 53 \u2212 11y = 10y 106 + 11x53 \u2212 11x = 0 ,\n\n(1.2)\n\nhas 5 positive solutions.\nSince we may multiply one of the trinomials in (1.2) by an arbitrary monomial without changing the solutions, we can assume that the two trinomials (1.2) share a common\nmonomial, and so there are at most 3 + 3 \u2212 1 = 5 = 2 + 2 + 1 monomials between the\ntwo trinomials, and so two trinomials give a fewnomial system with l = n = 2. While 5\nis less than 5184, Theorem 1.4 does not quite show that X(2, 2) = 5 as two trinomials do\nnot constitute a general fewnomial system with l = n = 2. Nevertheless, Theorem 1.4 gave\nstrong evidence that Khovanskii's bound may be improved. Such an improved bound was\ngiven in [13].\nTheorem 1.5 X(l, n) <\n\nl\ne2 +3 (2) l\n2 n.\n4\n\nFor small values of l, it is not hard to improve this. For example, when l = 0, the\nsupport A of the system is a simplex, and there will be at most 1 positive real solution, so\nX(0, n) = 1. Theorem 1.5 was inspired by the sharp bound of Theorem 1.6 when l = 1 [9].\nA set A of exponents is primitive if A affinely spans the full integer lattice Zn .\n4\n\n\fTheorem 1.6 If l = 1 and the set A of exponents is primitive, then there can be at most\n2n+1 nondegenerate nonzero real solutions, and this is sharp in that for any n there exist\nsystems with n+2 monomials and 2n+1 nondegenerate real solutions whose exponent vectors\naffinely span Zn .\nObserve that this bound is for all real solutions, not just positive solutions. We will\ndiscuss this in Section 4.3. Further analysis gives the sharp bound for X(1, n).\nTheorem 1.7 (Bihan [11]) X(1, n) = n + 1.\nIn contrast to these results establishing absolute upper bounds for the number of real\nsolutions which improve the trivial bound of the number d of complex roots, there are a\nsurprising number of problems that come from geometry for which all solutions can be real.\nFor example, Sturmfels [120] proved the following.\nTheorem 1.8 Suppose that a lattice polytope \u2206 \u2282 Zn admits a regular triangulation with\neach simplex having minimal volume n!1 . Then there is a system of sparse polynomials with\nsupport \u2206 \u2229 Zn having all solutions real.\nFor many problems from enumerative geometry, it is similarly possible that all solutions\ncan be real. This will be discussed in Chapter 7. The state of affairs in 2001 was presented\nin [112].\n\n1.2\n\nThe Wronski map and the Shapiro Conjecture\n\nThe Wronskian of univariate polynomials f1 (t), f2 (t), . . . , fm (t) is the determinant\n\u0001\n\u2202 j\u22121\nWr (f1 , . . . , fm ) := det ( \u2202t\n) fi (t) i,j=1,...,m .\n\nWhen the polynomials fi have degree m+p\u22121 and are linearly independent, the Wronskian\nhas degree at most mp. For example, if m = 2, then W (f, g) = f \u2032 g\u2212f g \u2032 , which has degree 2p\nas the coefficients of t2p+1 in this expression cancel. Up to a scalar, the Wronskian depends\nonly upon the linear span of the polynomials f1 , f2 , . . . , fm . Removing these ambiguities\ngives the Wronski map,\nWr := Gr(m, Cm+p\u22121 [t]) \u2212\u2192 Pmp ,\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhere Gr(m, Cm+p\u22121 [t]) is the Grassmannian of m-dimensional subspaces of the linear space\nCm+p\u22121 [t] of polynomials of degree m+p\u22121 in the variable t, and Pmp is the projective space\nof polynomials of degree at most mp, which has dimension equal to the the dimension of\nthe Grassmannian.\nWork of Schubert in 1886 [99], combined with a result of Eisenbud and Harris in 1983 [30]\nshows that the Wronski map is surjective and the general polynomial \u03a6 \u2208 Pmp has\n#m,p :=\n\n1!2! * * * (m\u22121)! * (mp)!\nm!(m+1)! * * * (m+p\u22121)!\n5\n\n(1.4)\n\n\fpreimages under the Wronski map. These results concern the complex Grassmannian and\ncomplex projective space.\nBoris Shapiro and Michael Shapiro made a conjecture in 1993/4 about the Wronski map\nfrom the real Grassmannian to real projective space. This was proven when min(k, d+1\u2212k) =\n2 by Eremenko and Gabrielov [34], and finally settled by Mukhin, Tarasov, and Varchenko [81].\nThey have subsequently found another proof [82].\nTheorem 1.9 If the polynomial \u03a6 \u2208 Pmp has only real zeroes, then every point in Wr \u22121 (\u03a6)\nis real. Moreover, if \u03a6 has mp simple real zeroes then there are #m,p real points in Wr \u22121 (\u03a6).\nWe will sketch the proof of Mukhin, Tarasov, and Varchenko in Chapter 10. This Shapiro\nConjecture has appealing geometric interpretations, enjoys links to several areas of mathematics, and has many theoretically satisfying generalizations which we will discuss in Chapters 8, 9, and 11. We now mention two of its interpretations.\n\n1.2.1\n\nThe problem of four lines\n\nA geometric interpretation of the Wronski map and the Shapiro Conjecture when m = p = 2\nis a variant of the classical problem of the lines in space which meet four given lines. Points\nin Gr(2, C3 [t]) correspond to lines in C3 as follows. The moment curve \u03b3 in C3 is the curve\nwith parameterization\n\u03b3(t) := (t, t2 , t3 ) .\nA cubic polynomial f is the composition of \u03b3 and an affine-linear map C3 \u2192 C, and so\na two-dimensional space of cubic polynomials is to a two-dimensional space of affine-linear\nmaps whose common kernel is the corresponding line in C3 . (This description is not exact,\nas some points in Gr(2, C3 [t]) correspond to lines at infinity.)\nGiven a polynomial \u03a6(t) of degree 4 with distinct real roots, points in the fiber Wr \u22121 (\u03a6)\ncorrespond to the lines in space which meet the four lines tangent to the moment curve \u03b3\nat its points coming from the roots of \u03a6. There will be two such lines, and the Shapiro\nconjecture asserts that both will be real.\nIt is not hard to see this directly. Any fractional linear change of parameterization of\nthe moment curve is realized by a projective linear transformation of 3-dimensional space\nwhich stabilizes the image of the moment curve. Thus we may assume that the polynomial\n\u03a6(t) is equal to (t3 \u2212 t)(t \u2212 s), which has roots \u22121, 0, 1, and s, where s \u2208 (0, 1). Applying\nan affine transformation to 3-dimensional space, the moment curve becomes the curve with\nparameterization\n\u03b3 : t 7\u2212\u2192 (6t2 \u2212 1, 72 t3 + 23 t, 32 t \u2212 21 t3 ) .\nThen the lines tangent to \u03b3 at the roots \u22121, 0, 1 of \u03a6 have parameterizations\n(\u22125 \u2212 s, 5 + s, \u22121) , (\u22121, s, s) , (5 + s , 5 + s , 1)\n\ns \u2208 R.\n\nThese lie on a hyperboloid Q of one sheet, which is defined by\n1 \u2212 x21 + x22 \u2212 x23 = 0 .\n6\n\n(1.5)\n\n\fl(\u22121)\n\nl(1)\n\n\u03b3\nQ\n\n\u03b3\n\nl(\u22121)\n\nl(0)\n\nFigure 1.1: Quadric containing three lines tangent to \u03b3.\nWe display this geometric configuration in Figure 1.1. There, l(i) is the line tangent to \u03b3\nat the point \u03b3(i). The quadric Q has two rulings. One ruling contains our three tangent\nlines and the other ruling (which is drawn on Q) consists of the lines which meet our three\ntangent lines.\nNow consider the fourth line l(s) which is tangent to \u03b3 at the point \u03b3(s). This has the\nparameterization\n\u0001\n\u0001\nl(s) = 6s2 \u2212 1 , 27 s3 + 32 s , 23 s \u2212 12 s3 + t 12s , 21\ns2 + 23 , 23 \u2212 32 s2 .\n2\nWe compute the intersection of the fourth line with Q. Substituting its parameterization\ninto (1.5) and dividing by \u221212 gives the equation\n(s3 \u2212 s)(s3 \u2212 s + t(6s2 \u2212 2) + 9st2 ) = 0 .\n\nThe first (nonconstant) factor s3 \u2212 s vanishes when l(s) is equal to one of l(\u22121), l(\u22120), or\nl(\u22121)\u2013for these values of s every point of l(s) lies on the quadric Q. The second factor has\nsolutions\n\u221a\n3s2 \u2212 1 \u00b1 3s2 + 1\n.\nt = \u2212\n9s\nSince 3s2 + 1 > 0 for all s, both solutions will be real.\nWe may also see this geometrically. Consider the fourth line l(s) for 0 < s < 1. In\nFigure 1.2, we look down the throat of the hyperboloid at the interesting part of this configuration. This picture demonstrates that l(s) must meet Q in two real points. Through\neach point, there is a real line in the second ruling which meets all four tangent lines, and\nthis proves Shapiro's conjecture for m = p = 2.\n\n1.2.2\n\nRational functions with real critical points\n\nWhen m = 2, the Shapiro conjecture may be interpreted in terms of rational functions.\nA rational function \u03c1(t) = f (t)/g(t) is a quotient of two univariate polynomials, f and g.\n7\n\n\fl(0)\n\nQ\nl(s)\n6\n\nl(1)\n\nl(\u22121)\n\n\u03b3\n\n\u03b3(s)\nFigure 1.2: The fourth tangent line meets Q in two real points.\nThis defines a map \u03c1 : P1 \u2192 P1 whose critical points are those t for which \u03c1\u2032 (t) = 0. Since\n\u03c1\u2032 (t) = (f \u2032 g \u2212 g \u2032f )/g 2 , we see that the critical points are the roots of the Wronskian of f\nand g. Composing the rational function \u03c1 : P1 \u2192 P1 with an automorphism of the target\nP1 gives an equivalent rational function, and the equivalence class of \u03c1 is determined by\nthe linear span of its numerator and denominator. Thus Shapiro's conjecture asserts that a\nrational function having only real critical points is equivalent to a real rational function.\nEremenko and Gabrielov [34] proved exactly this statement in 2002, and thereby established the Shapiro Conjecture in the case m = 2.\nTheorem 1.10 A rational function with only real critical points is equivalent to a real\nrational function.\nIn Chapter 9 we will present an elementary proof of this result that Eremenko and\nGabrielov found in 2005 [32].\n\n1.3\n\nLower bounds\n\nWe begin with some of perhaps the most exciting recent development in real algebraic\ngeometry. It begins with the fundamental observation of Euclid that two points determine a\nline. Many people who have studied geometry know that five points on the plane determine\na conic. In general, if you have m random points in the plane and you want to pass a\nrational curve of degree d through all of them, there may be no solution to this interpolation\nproblem (if m is too big), or an infinite number of solutions (if m is too small), or a finite\nnumber of solutions (if m is just right). It turns out that \"m just right\" means m = 3d\u22121\n(m = 2 for lines and m = 5 for conics).\nA harder question is, if m = 3d\u22121, how many rational curves of degree d interpolate\nthe points? Let's call this number Nd , so that N1 = 1 and N2 = 1 because the line and\nconic of the previous paragraph are unique. It has long been known that N3 = 12, and in\n1873 Zeuthen [132] showed that N4 = 620. That was where matters stood until 1989, when\n8\n\n\fRan [89] gave a recursion for these numbers. In the 1990's, Kontsevich and Manin [69] used\nassociativity in quantum cohomology of P2 to give the elegant recursion\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0012\nX\n3d \u2212 4\n3\n2 2 3d \u2212 4\n,\n(1.6)\n\u2212a b\nNd =\nNa Nb a b\n3a \u2212 1\n3a \u2212 2\na+b=d\nwhich begins with the Euclidean declaration that two points determine a line (N1 = 1).\nThese numbers grow quite fast, for example N5 = 87304.\nThe number of real rational curves which interpolate a given 3d\u22121 points in the real plane\n2\nRP will depend rather subtly on the configuration of the points. To say anything about the\nreal rational curves would seem impossible. However this is exactly what Welschinger [131]\ndid. He found an invariant which does not depend upon the choice of points. \u0001\nA rational curve in the plane is necessarily singular-typically it has d\u22121\nnodes. Real\n2\ncurves have three types of nodes. Only two types are visible in RP2 , and we are familiar with\nthem from rational cubics. The curve on the left below has a node with two real branches,\nand the curve on the right has a solitary point '\u2022', where two complex conjugate branches\nmeet.\n\nThe third type of node is a pair of complex conjugate nodes, which are not visible in RP2 .\nTheorem 1.11 (Welschinger [131]) The sum,\nX\n(\u22121)#{solitary points, \u2022,in C} ,\n\n(1.7)\n\nover all real rational curves C of degree d interpolating 3d\u22121 general points in RP2 does not\ndepend upon the choice of the points.\nSet Wd to be the sum (1.7). The absolute value of this Welschinger invariant is then a\nlower bound for the number of real rational curves of degree d interpolating 3d \u2212 1 points\nin RP2 . Since N1 = N2 = 1, we have W1 = W2 = 1. Prior to Welschinger's discovery,\nKharlamov [23, Proposition 4.7.3] (see also Section 7.2.2) showed that W3 = 8. The question\nremained whether any other Welschinger invariants were nontrivial. This was settled in the\naffirmative by Itenberg, Kharlamov, and Shustin [56, 57], who used Mikhalkin's Tropical\nCorrespondence Theorem [79] to show\n1. If d > 0, then Wd \u2265\n\nd!\n.\n3\n\n(Hence Wd is positive.)\n\nlog Nd\n= 1.

Since then, Itenberg, Kharlamov, and Shustin [58] gave a recursive formula\nfor the Welschinger invariant which is based upon Gathmann and Markwig's [45] tropicalization of the Caporaso-Harris [18] formula. This shows that W4 = 240 and W5 = 18264.\nSolomon [103] has also found an intersection-theoretic interpretation for these invariants.\nThese ideas have also found an application. Gahleitner, J\u00fcttler, and Schicho [44] proposed a method to compute an approximate parametrization of a plane curve using rational\ncubics. Later, Fiedler-Le Touz\u00e9 [36] used the result of Kharlamov (that W3 = 8), and an\nanalysis of pencils of plane cubics to prove that this method works.\nWhile the story of this interpolation problem is fairly well-known, it was not the first\ninstance of lower bounds in enumerative real algebraic geometry. In their investigation of\nthe Shapiro conjecture, Eremenko and Gabrielov found a similar invariant \u03c3m,p which gives\na lower bound on the number of real points in the inverse image Wr \u22121 (\u03a6) under the Wronski\nmap of a real polynomial \u03a6 \u2208 RPmp) .

When f is differentiable, this may be computed as follows. Let y \u2208 Y\nbe a regular value of f so that at any point x in the fiber f \u22121 (y) above y the derivative\ndx f : Tx X \u2192 Ty Y is an isomorphism. Since X and Y are oriented, the isomorphism dx f\neither preserves the orientation or it reverses it. Let P be the number of points x \u2208 f \u22121 (y)\nat which dx f preserves the orientation and R be the number of points where the orientation\nis reversed. Then the degree of f is the difference P \u2212 R.\nThere is a slight problem in computing the degree of WrR , as neither the real Grassmannian nor the real projective space is orientable when m+p is odd, and thus the topological\ndegree of WrR is not defined when m+p is odd. Eremenko and Gabrielov get around this by\ncomputing the degree of the restriction of the Wronski map to open cells of GrR and RPmp ,\nwhich is a proper map. They also show that it is the degree of a lift of the Wronski map to\noriented double covers of both\nto the Welschinger\nP spaces. The degree bears a resemblance\n\u22121\ninvariant as it has the form | \u00b11|, the sum over all real points in Wr R (\u03a6), for \u03a6 a regular\nvalue of the Wronski map. This resemblance is no accident. Solomon [103] showed how to\norient a moduli space of rational curves with marked points so that the Welschinger invariant\nis indeed the degree of a map.\nWhile both of these examples of geometric problems possessing a lower bound on their\nnumbers of real solutions are quite interesting, they are rather special. The existence of\nlower bounds for more general problems or for more general systems of polynomials would\nbe quite important in applications, as these lower bounds guarantee the existence of real\nsolutions.\nWith Soprunova, we [105] set out to develop a theory of lower bounds for sparse polynomial systems, using the approach of Eremenko and Gabrielov via topological degree. This is\na first step toward practical applications of these ideas. Chapter 6 will elaborate this theory.\nHere is an outline:\n(i) Realize the solutions to a system of polynomials as the fibers of a map from a toric\nvariety.\n(ii) Give a condition which implies that the degree of this map (or a lift to double covers)\nexists.\n11\n\n\f(iii) Develop a method to compute the degree in some (admittedly special) cases.\n(iv) Give a nice family of examples to which this theory applies.\n(v) Use the sagbi degeneration of a Grassmannian to a toric variety [122, Ch. 11] and the\nsystems of (iv) to recover the result of Eremenko and Gabrielov.\nExample 1.14 We close this Chapter with one example from this theory. Let w, x, y, z be\nindeterminates, and consider a sparse polynomial of the form\nc4 wxyz\n+ c3 (wxz + xyz)\n+ c2 (wx + xz + yz)\n+ c1 (x + z)\n+ c0 ,\n\n(1.8)\n\nwhere the coefficients c0 , . . . , c4 are real numbers.\nTheorem 1.15 A system of four equations involving polynomials of the form (1.8) has six\nsolutions, at least two of which are real.\nWe make some remarks to illustrate the ingredients of this theory. First, the monomials\nin the sparse system (1.8) are the integer points in the order polytope of the poset P ,\nx\n\nz\n.\n\nP :=\nw\n\ny\n\nThat is, each monomial corresponds to an order ideal of P (a subset which is closed upwards).\nThe number of complex roots is the number of linear extensions of the poset P . There are\nsix, as each is a permutation of the word wxyz where w precedes x and y precedes z.\nOne result (ii) gives conditions on the Newton polytope which imply that any polynomial\nsystem with that Newton polytope has a lower bound, and order polytopes satisfy these\nconditions. Another result (iv) computes that lower bound for certain families of polynomials\nwith support an order polytope. Polynomials in these families have the form (1.8) in that\nmonomials with the same total degree have the same coefficient. For such polynomials, the\nlower bound is the absolute value of the sum of the signs of the permutations underlying\nthe linear extensions. We list these for P .\npermutation\nsign\n\nwxyz\n+\n\nwyxz\n\u2212\n\nywxz\n+\n\nwyzx ywzx yzwx\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\nThis shows that the lower bound in Theorem 1.15 is 2.\n\n12\n\nsum\n2\n\n\fWe record the frequency of the different root counts in each of 10,000,000 instances of\nthis polynomial system, where the coefficients were chosen uniformly from [\u2212200, 200].\nnumber of real roots 0\n2\n4\nfrequency 0 9519429 0\n\n6\n480571\n\nThis computation took 19,854 CPU-seconds, or 5:30:54 on a AMD Athlon 64-bit dual core\nprocessor 4600+ (2.4 GHz, 512KB cache), using a single core.\nThe apparent gap in the numbers of real solutions (4 does not seem a possible number of\nreal solutions) is proven for the system of Example 1.14. This is the first instance we have\nseen of this phenomena of gaps in the numbers of real solutions. More are found in [105]\nand [94].\n\n13\n\n\fChapter 2:\nReal solutions to univariate\npolynomials\nBefore we study the real solutions to systems of multivariate polynomials, we will review\nsome of what is known for univariate polynomials. The strength and precision of results\nconcerning real solutions to univariate polynomials forms the gold standard in this subject\nof real roots to systems of polynomials. We will discuss two results about univariate polynomials: Descartes' rule of signs and Sturm's Theorem. Descartes' rule of signs, or rather\nits generalization in the Budan-Fourier Theorem, gives a bound for the number of roots in\nan interval, counted with multiplicity. Sturm's theorem is topological-it simply counts the\nnumber of roots of a univariate polynomial in an interval without multiplicity. From Sturm's\nTheorem we obtain a symbolic algorithm to count the number of real solutions to a system\nof multivariate polynomials in many cases. We underscore the topological nature of Sturm's\nTheorem by presenting a new and very elementary proof due to Burda and Khovanskii [63].\nThese and other fundamental results about real roots of univariate polynomials were established in the 19th century. In contrast, the main results about real solutions to multivariate\npolynomials were only established in recent decades.\n\n2.1\n\nDescartes' rule of signs\n\nDescartes' rule of signs [24] is fundamental for real algebraic geometry. Suppose that f is a\nunivariate polynomial and write its terms in increasing order of their exponents,\nf = c0 xa0 + c1 xa1 + * * * + cm xam ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere ci 6= 0 and a0 < a1 < * * * < am .\nTheorem 2.1 (Descartes' rule of signs) The number, r, of positive roots of f , counted\nwith multiplicity, is at most the variation in sign of the coefficients of f ,\n#{i | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m and ci\u22121 ci < 0} \u2264 r ,\nand the difference between the variation and r is even.\nWe will prove a generalization, the Budan-Fourier Theorem, which provides a similar\nestimate for any interval in R. We first formalize this notion of variation in sign that\nappears in Descartes' rule.\nThe variation var(c) in a finite sequence c of real numbers is the number of times that\nconsecutive elements of the sequence have opposite signs, after we remove any 0s in the\n14\n\n\fsequence. For example, the first sequence below has four variations, while the second has\nthree.\n8, \u22124, \u22122, \u22121, 2, 3, \u22125, 7, 11, 12\n\u2212 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, \u22121, 1, 1, 0, 1 .\nSuppose that we have a sequence F = (f0 , f1 , . . . , fk ) of polynomials and a real number\na \u2208 R. Then var(F, a) is the variation in the sequence f0 (a), f1 (a), . . . , fk (a). This notion\nalso makes sense when a = \u00b1\u221e: We set var(F, \u221e) to be the variation in the sequence of\nleading coefficients of the fi (t), which are the signs of fi (a) for a \u226b 0, and set var(F, \u2212\u221e)\nto be the variation in the leading coefficients of fi (\u2212t).\nGiven a univariate polynomial f (t) of degree k, let \u03b4f be the sequence of its derivatives,\n\u03b4f := (f (t), f \u2032(t), f \u2032\u2032 (t), . . . , f (k) (t)) .\nFor a, b \u2208 R \u222a {\u00b1\u221e}, let r(f, a, b) be the number of roots of f in the interval (a, b], counted\nwith multiplicity. We prove a version of Descartes' rule due to Budan [16] and Fourier [37].\nTheorem 2.2 (Budan-Fourier) Let f \u2208 R[t] be a univariate polynomial and a < b two\nnumbers in R \u222a {\u00b1\u221e}. Then\nvar(\u03b4f, a) \u2212 var(\u03b4f, b) \u2265 r(f, a, b) ,\nand the difference is even.\nWe may deduce Descartes' rule of signs from the Budan-Fourier Theorem once we observe\nthat for the polynomial f (t) (2.1), var(\u03b4f, 0) = var(c0 , c1 , . . . , cm ), while var(\u03b4f, \u221e) = 0, as\nthe leading coefficients of \u03b4f all have the same sign.\nExample 2.3 The the sextic f = 5t6 \u2212 4t5 \u2212 27t4 + 55t2 \u2212 6 whose graph is displayed below\nf\n60\n40\n20\nt\n\u22121\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\u221220\n\nhas four real zeroes at approximately \u22120.339311, 0.340401, 1.59753, 2.25615. If we evaluate\nthe derivatives of f at 0 we obtain\n\u03b4f (0) = \u22126, 0, 110, 0, \u2212648, \u2212480, 3600 ,\n15\n\n\fwhich has 3 variations in sign. If we evaluate the derivatives of f at 2, we obtain\n\u03b4f (2) = \u221226, \u22124, 574, 2544, 5592, 6720, 3600 ,\nwhich has one sign variation. Thus, by the Budan-Fourier Theorem, f has either 2 or 0\nroots in the interval (0, 2), counted with multiplicity. This agrees with our observation that\nf has 2 roots in the interval [0, 2].\nProof of Budan-Fourier Theorem. Observe that var(\u03b4f, t) can only change when t passes a\nroot c of some polynomial in the sequence \u03b4f of derivatives of f . Suppose that c is a root\nof some derivative of f and let \u01eb > 0 be a positive number such that no derivative f (i) has\na root in the interval [c \u2212 \u01eb, c + \u01eb], except possibly at c. Let m be the order of vanishing of\nf at c. We will prove that\n(1)\n\nvar(\u03b4f, c) = var(\u03b4f, c + \u01eb), and\n\n(2)\n\nvar(\u03b4f, c \u2212 \u01eb) \u2265 var(\u03b4f, c) + m, and the difference is even.\n\n(2.2)\n\nWe deduce the Budan-Fourier theorem from these conditions. As t ranges from a to b,\nboth r(f, a, t) and var(\u03b4f, t) only change when t passes a root c of f . (These could change\nat a root of a derivative of f , but in fact do not.) At such a point, r(f, a, t) jumps by the\nmultiplicity m of that root of f , while var(\u03b4f, t) drops by m, plus a nonnegative even integer.\nThus the sum r(f, a, t) + var(\u03b4f, t) can only change at roots c of f , where it drops by an even\ninteger. Since this sum equals var(\u03b4f, a) when t = a, the Budan-Fourier Theorem follows.\nLet us now prove our claim about the behavior of var(\u03b4f, t) in a neighborhood of a root\nc of some derivative f (i) . We argue by induction on the degree of f . When f has degree 1,\nthen we are in one of the following two cases, depending upon the sign of f \u2032\nf \u2032 (t)\n\nf (t)\nc\u2212\u01eb\n\nc+\u01eb\nc\n\nc\u2212\u01eb\n\nc+\u01eb\n\nf (t)\n\nc\n\nf \u2032 (t)\n\nIn both cases, var(\u03b4f, c \u2212 \u01eb) = 1, but var(\u03b4f, c) = var(\u03b4f, c + \u01eb) = 0, which proves the claim\nwhen f is linear.\nNow suppose that the degree of f is greater than 1 and let m be the order of vanishing\nof f at c. We first treat the case when f (c) = 0, and hence m > 0 so that f \u2032 vanishes at c\nto order m\u22121. We apply our induction hypothesis to f \u2032 and obtain that\nvar(\u03b4f \u2032 , c) = var(\u03b4f \u2032, c + \u01eb),\n\nand\n\nvar(\u03b4f \u2032 , c \u2212 \u01eb) \u2265 var(\u03b4f \u2032 , c) + (m \u2212 1) ,\n\nand the difference is even. By Lagrange's Mean Value Theorem applied to the intervals\n[c \u2212 \u01eb, c] and [c, c + \u01eb], f and f \u2032 must have opposite signs at c \u2212 \u01eb, but the same signs at c + \u01eb,\nand so\nvar(\u03b4f, c) = var(\u03b4f \u2032 , c) = var(\u03b4f \u2032 , c + \u01eb) = var(\u03b4f, c + \u01eb) ,\nvar(\u03b4f, c \u2212 \u01eb) = var(\u03b4f \u2032 , c \u2212 \u01eb) + 1 \u2265 var(\u03b4f \u2032 , c) + (m \u2212 1) + 1 = var(\u03b4f, c) + m ,\n16\n\n\fand the difference is even. This proves the claim when f (c) = 0.\nNow suppose that f (c) 6= 0 so that m = 0. Let n be the order of vanishing of f \u2032 at c.\nWe apply our induction hypothesis to f \u2032 to obtain that\nvar(\u03b4f \u2032 , c) = var(\u03b4f \u2032 , c + \u01eb),\n\nand\n\nvar(\u03b4f \u2032 , c \u2212 \u01eb) \u2265 var(\u03b4f \u2032 , c) + n ,\n\nand the difference is even. We have f (c) 6= 0, but f \u2032 (c) = * * * = f (n) (c) = 0, and f (n+1) (c) 6=\n0. Multiplying f by \u22121 if necessary, we may assume that f (n+1) (c) > 0. There are four\ncases: n even or odd, and f (c) positive or negative. We consider each case separately.\nSuppose that n is even. Then both f \u2032 (c \u2212 \u01eb) and f \u2032 (c + \u01eb) are positive and so for each\nt \u2208 {c \u2212 \u01eb, c, c + \u01eb} the first nonzero term in the sequence\nf \u2032 (t), f \u2032\u2032 (t), . . . , f (k) (t)\n\n(2.3)\n\nis positive. When f (c) is positive, this implies that var(\u03b4f, t) = var(\u03b4f \u2032 , t) and when f (c) is\nnegative, that var(\u03b4f, t) = var(\u03b4f \u2032 , t)+1. This proves the claim as it implies that var(\u03b4f, c) =\nvar(\u03b4f, c + \u01eb) and also that\nvar(\u03b4f, c \u2212 \u01eb) \u2212 var(\u03b4f, c) = var(\u03b4f \u2032 , c \u2212 \u01eb) \u2212 var(\u03b4f \u2032, c) ,\nbut this last difference exceeds n by an even number, and so is even as n is even.\nNow suppose that n is odd. Then f \u2032 (c \u2212 \u01eb) < 0 < f \u2032 (c + \u01eb) and so the first nonzero\nterm in the sequence (2.3) has sign \u2212, +, + as t = c \u2212 \u01eb, c, c + \u01eb. If f (c) is positive, then\nvar(\u03b4f, c \u2212 \u01eb) = var(\u03b4f \u2032 , c \u2212 \u01eb) + 1 and the other two variations are unchanged, but if f (c)\nis negative, then the variation at t = c \u2212 \u01eb is unchanged, but it increases by 1 at t = c and\nt = c + \u01eb. This again implies the claim, as var(\u03b4f, c) = var(\u03b4f, c + \u01eb), but\nvar(\u03b4f, c \u2212 \u01eb) \u2212 var(\u03b4f, c) = var(\u03b4f \u2032, c \u2212 \u01eb) \u2212 var(\u03b4f \u2032 , c) \u00b1 1 .\nSince the difference var(\u03b4f \u2032 , c \u2212 \u01eb) \u2212 var(\u03b4f \u2032 , c) is equal to the order n of the vanishing of f \u2032\nat c plus a nonnegative even number, if we add or subtract 1, the difference is a nonnegative\neven number. This completes the proof of the Budan-Fourier Theorem.\n\n2.2\n\nSturm's Theorem\n\nLet f, g be univariate polynomials. Their Sylvester sequence is the sequence of polynomials\nf0 := f, f1 := g, f2 , . . . , fk ,\nwhere fk is a greatest common divisor of f and g, and\n\u2212fi+1 := remainder(fi\u22121 , fi ) ,\nthe usual remainder from the Euclidean algorithm.

Then the number of zeroes of f in the interval (a, b) is the\ndifference\nvar(F, a) \u2212 var(F, b) ,\nwhere F is the Sturm sequence of f .\nExample 2.5 The sextic f of Example 2.3 has Sturm sequence\nf\n\u2032\nf1 := f (t)\nf2\nf3\nf4\nf5\nf6\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n5t6 \u2212 4t5 \u2212 27t4 + 55t2 \u2212 6\n30t5 \u2212 20t4 \u2212 108t3 + 110t\n84 4\nt + 12\nt3 \u2212 110\nt2 \u2212 22\nt+6\n9\n5\n3\n9\n559584 3\n143748 2\n605394\nt + 1445 t \u2212 7225 t \u2212 126792\n36125\n7225\n229905821875 2\n1540527685625\n7904908625\nt + 4349086848 t + 120807968\n724847808\n280364022223059296\n\u2212 58526435357253125 t + 174201756039315072\n292632176786265625\n\u2212 17007035533771824564661037625\n.\n162663080627869030112013128\n\nEvaluating the Sturm sequence at t = 0 gives\n\u22126, 0, 6, \u2212 126792\n,\n7225\n\n174201756039315072\n,\n292632176786265625\n\n\u2212 17007035533771824564661037625\n,\n162663080627869030112013128\n\nwhich has 4 variations in sign, while evaluating the Sturm sequence at t = 2 gives\n\u221226, \u22124,\n\n1114 3210228\n, 36125 ,\n45\n\n\u2212 1076053821625\n, \u2212 2629438466191277888\n, \u2212 17007035533771824564661037625\n,\n2174543424\n292632176786265625\n162663080627869030112013128\n\nwhich has 2 variations in sign. Thus by Sturm's Theorem, we see that f has 2 roots in the\ninterval [0, 2], which we have already seen by other methods.\nAn application of Sturm's Theorem is to isolate real solutions to a univariate polynomial\nf by finding intervals of a desired width that contain a unique root of f . When (a, b) =\n(\u2212\u221e, \u221e), Sturm's Theorem gives the total number of real roots of a univariate polynomial.\nIn this way, it leads to an algorithm to investigate the number of real roots of generic\nsystems of polynomials. We briefly describe this algorithm here. This algorithm was used in\nan essential way to get information on real solutions which helped to formulate many results\ndiscussed in later chapters.\nSuppose that we have a system of real multivariate polynomials\nf1 (x1 , . . . , xn ) = f2 (x1 , . . . , xn ) = * * * = fN (x1 , . . . , xn ) = 0 ,\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhose number of real roots we wish to determine. Let I \u2282 R[x1 , . . . , xn ] be the ideal\ngenerated by the polynomials f1 , f2 , . . . , fN . If (2.5) has finitely many complex zeroes, then\nthe dimension of the quotient ring (the degree of I) is finite, and for each variable xi , there\nis a univariate polynomial g(xi ) \u2208 I of minimal degree, called an eliminant for I.\nProposition 2.6 The roots of g(xi ) = 0 form the set of ith coordinates of solutions to (2.5).\n18\n\n\fThe main tool here is a consequence of the Shape Lemma [4].\nTheorem 2.7 (Shape Lemma) Suppose that I has an eliminant g(xi ) whose degree is\nequal to the degree of I. Then the number of real solutions to (2.5) is equal to the number\nof real roots of g.\nSuppose that the coefficients of the polynomials fi in the system (2.5) lie in a computable\nsubfield of R, for example, Q (e.g. if the coefficients are integers). Then the degree of I may\nbe computed using Gr\u00f6bner bases, and we may also use Gr\u00f6bner bases to compute an\neliminant g(xi ). Since Buchberger's algorithm does not enlarge the field of the coefficients,\ng(xi ) \u2208 Q[xi ] has rational coefficients, and so we may use Sturm sequences to compute the\nnumber of its real roots.\nAlgorithm\nGiven: I = hf1 , . . . , fN i \u2282 Q[x1 , . . . , xn ]\n1. Use Gr\u00f6bner bases to compute the degree d of I.\n2. Use Gr\u00f6bner bases to compute an eliminant g(xi ) \u2208 I \u2229 Q[xi ] for I.\n3. If deg(g) = d, then use Sturm sequences to compute the number r of real roots of\ng(xi ), and output \"The ideal I has r real solutions.\"\n4. Otherwise output \"The ideal I does not satisfy the hypotheses of the Shape Lemma.\"\nIf this algorithm halts with a failure (step 4), it may be called again to compute an eliminant for a different variable. Another strategy is to apply a random linear transformation\nbefore eliminating. An even more sophisticated form of elimination is Roullier's rational\nunivariate representation [93].\n\n2.2.1\n\nTraditional Proof of Sturm's Theorem\n\nLet f (t) be a real univariate polynomial with Sturm sequence F . We prove Sturm's Theorem\nby looking at the variation var(F, t) as t increases from a to b. This variation can only change\nwhen t passes a number c where some member fi of the Sturm sequence has a root, for then\nthe sign of fi could change. We will show that if i > 0, then this has no effect on the\nvariation of the sequence, but when c is a root of f = f0 , then the variation decreases by\nexactly 1 as t passes c. Since multiplying a sequence by a nonzero number does not change\nits variation, we will at times make an assumption on the sign of some value fj (c) to reduce\nthe number of cases to examine.\nObserve first that by (2.4), if fi (c) = fi+1 (c) = 0, then fi\u22121 also vanishes at c, as do the\nother polynomials fj . In particular f (c) = f \u2032 (c) = 0, so f has a multiple root at c. Suppose\nfirst that this does not happen, either that f (c) 6= 0 or that c is a simple root of f .\nSuppose that fi (c) = 0 for some i > 0. The vanishing of fi at c, together with (2.4)\nimplies that fi\u22121 (c) and fi (c) have opposite signs. Then, whatever the sign of fi (t) for t near\nc, there is exactly one variation in sign coming from the subsequence fi\u22121 (t), fi (t), fi+1 (t),\n19\n\n\fand so the vanishing of fi at c has no effect on the variation as t passes c. Note that this\nargument works equally well for any Sylvester sequence.\nNow we consider the effect on the variation when c is a simple root of f . In this case\n\u2032\nf (c) 6= 0, so we may assume that f \u2032 (c) > 0. But then f (t) is negative for t to the left of c\nand positive for t to the right of c. In particular, the variation var(F, t) decreases by exactly\n1 when t passes a simple root of f and does not change when f does not vanish.\nWe are left with the case when c is a multiple root of f . Suppose that its multiplicity is\nm + 1. Then (t \u2212 c)m divides every polynomial in the Sturm sequence of f . Consider the\nsequence of quotients,\nG = (g0 , . . . , gk ) := (f /(t \u2212 c)m , f \u2032 /(t \u2212 c)m , f2 /(t \u2212 c)m , * * * , fk /(t \u2212 c)m ) .\nNote that var(G, t) = var(F, t) when t 6= c, as multiplying a sequence by a nonzero number\ndoes not change its variation. Observe also that G is a Sylvester sequence. Since g1 (c) 6= 0,\nnot all polynomials gi vanish at c. But we showed in this case that there is no contribution\nto a change in the variation by any polynomial gi with i > 0.\nIt remains to examine the contribution of g0 to the variation as t passes c. If we write\nf (t) = (t \u2212 c)m+1 h(t) with h(c) 6= 0, then\nf \u2032 (t) = (m + 1)(t \u2212 c)m h(t) + (t \u2212 c)m+1 h\u2032 (t) .\nIn particular,\ng0 (t) = (t \u2212 c)h(t)\n\nand\n\ng1 (t) = (m + 1)h(t) + (t \u2212 c)h\u2032 (t) .\n\nIf we assume that h(c) > 0, then g1 (c) > 0 and g0 (t) changes from negative to positive as t\npasses c. Once again we see that the variation var(F, t) decreases by 1 when t passes a root\nof f . This completes the proof of Sturm's Theorem.\n\n2.3\n\nA topological proof of Sturm's Theorem\n\nWe present a second, very elementary, proof of Sturm's Theorem due to Burda and Khovanskii [63] whose virtue is in its tight connection to topology. We first recall the definition of\ntopological degree of a continuous function \u03c6 : RP1 \u2192 RP1 . Since RP1 is isomorphic to the\nquotient R/Z, we may pull \u03c6 back to the interval [0, 1] to obtain a map [0, 1] \u2192 RP1 . This\nmap lifts to the universal cover of RP1 to obtain a map \u03c8 : [0, 1] \u2192 R. Then the mapping\ndegree, mdeg(\u03c6), of \u03c6 is simply \u03c8(1) \u2212 \u03c8(0), which is an integer. We call this mapping\ndegree to distinguish it from the usual algebraic degree of a polynomial or rational function.\nThe key ingredient in this proof is a formula to compute the mapping degree of a rational\nfunction \u03c6 : RP1 \u2192 RP1 . Any rational function \u03c6 = f /g where f, g \u2208 R[t] are polynomials\n\n20\n\n\fhas a continued fraction expansion of the form\n1\n\n\u03c6 = q0 +\n\n(2.6)\n\n1\n\nq1 +\n\n1\n\nq2 +\n\n..\n\n.\n+\n\n1\nqk\n\nwhere q0 , . . . , qk are polynomials. Indeed, this continued fraction is constructed recursively.\nIf we divide f by g with remainder h, so that f = q0 g + h with the degree of h less than the\ndegree of g, then\n1\nh\n\u03c6 = q0 +\n.\n= q0 +\ng\ng\nh\nWe may again divide g by h with remainder, g = q1 h + k and obtain\n1\n\n\u03c6 = q0 +\nq1 +\n\n1\nh\nk\n\n.\n\nAs the degrees of the numerator and denominator drop with each step, this process terminates with an expansion (2.6) of \u03c6.\nFor example, if f = 4t4 \u2212 18t2 \u2212 6t and g = 4t3 + 8t2 \u2212 1, then\nf\n= t\u22122 +\ng\n\n1\n\u22122t + 1 +\n\n1\n\u22122t \u2212 3 +\n\n1\nt+1\n\nThis continued fraction expansion is just the Euclidean algorithm in disguise.\nSuppose that q = c0 + c1 t + * * * + cd td is a real polynomial of degree d. Define\n[q] := sign (cd ) * (d mod 2) \u2208 {\u00b11, 0} .\nTheorem 2.8 Suppose that \u03c6 is a rational function with continued fraction expansion (2.6).\nThen the mapping degree of \u03c6 is\n[q1 ] \u2212 [q2 ] + * * * + (\u22121)k\u22121 [qk ] .\nWe may use this to count the roots of a real polynomial f by the following lemma.\nLemma 2.9 The number of roots of a polynomial f , counted without multiplicity is the\nmapping degree of the rational function f /f \u2032 .\n21\n\n\fWe deduce Sturm's Theorem from Lemma 2.9. Let f0 , f1 , f2 . . . , fk be the Sturm sequence\nfor f . Then f0 = f , f1 = f \u2032 , and for i > 1, \u2212fi+1 := remainder(fi\u22121 , fi ). That is,\ndeg(fi ) < deg(fi\u22121 ) and there are univariate polynomials g1 , g2 , . . . , gk with\nfi\u22121 = gi fi \u2212 fi+1\n\nfor i = 1, 2, . . . , k\u22121 .\n\nWe relate these polynomials to those obtained from the Euclidean algorithm applied to f, f \u2032\nand thus to the continued fraction expansion of f /f \u2032 . It is clear that the fi differ only by a\nsign from the remainders in the Euclidean algorithm. Set r0 := f and r1 = f \u2032 , and for i > 1,\nri := remainder(ri\u22122 , ri\u22121 ). Then deg(ri ) < deg(ri\u22121 ), and there are univariate polynomials\nq1 , q2 , . . . , qk with\nri\u2212i = qi ri + ri+1\nfor i = 1, . . . , k\u22121 .\nWe leave the proof of the following lemma as an exercise for the reader.\ni\n\nLemma 2.10 We have gi = (\u22121)i\u22121 qi and fi = (\u22121)\u230a 2 \u230b ri , for i = 1, 2, . . . , k.\nWrite F for the Sturm sequence (f0 , f1 , f2 . . . , fk ) for f . Then var(F, \u221e) is the variation\nin the leading coefficients (f0top , f1top , . . . , fktop ) of the polynomials in F . Similarly, var(F, \u2212\u221e)\nis the variation in the sequence\n((\u22121)deg(f0 ) f0top , (\u22121)deg(f1 ) f1top , . . . , (\u22121)deg(fk ) fktop ) .\nNote that the variation in a sequence (c0 , c1 , . . . , ck ) is just the sum of the variations in each\nsubsequence (ci\u22121 , ci ) for i = 1, . . . , k. Thus\nvar(F, \u2212\u221e) \u2212 var(F, \u221e)\n=\n\nk\nX\ni=1\n\n\u0001\ntop\ntop\nvar((\u22121)deg(fi\u22121 ) fi\u22121\n, (\u22121)deg(fi ) fitop ) \u2212 var(fi\u22121\n, fitop ) .\n\nSince fi\u22121 = gi fi \u2212 fi+1 and deg(fi+1 ) < deg(fi ) < deg(fi\u22121 ), we have\ntop\nfi\u22121\n= gitop fitop\n\nand\n\ndeg(fi\u22121 ) = deg(gi ) + deg(fi ) .\n\nThus we have\ntop\nvar(fi\u22121\n, fitop ) = var(gitop , 1) ,\ntop\nvar((\u22121)deg(fi\u22121 ) fi\u22121\n, (\u22121)deg(fi ) fitop )\n\n=\n\nand\n\nvar((\u22121)deg(gi ) gitop , 1) .\n\nThus the summands in (2.7) are\nvar((\u22121)deg(gi ) gitop , 1) \u2212 var(gitop , 1) = sign (gitop )(deg(gi ) mod 2)\n= [gi ] = (\u22121)i\u22121 [qi ] ,\nThis proves that\nvar(F, \u2212\u221e) \u2212 var(F, \u221e) = [g1 ] + [g2 ] + * * * + [gk ]\n= [q1 ] \u2212 [q2 ] + * * * + (\u22121)k\u22121 [qk ] .\n22\n\n(2.7)\n\n\fBut this proves Sturm's Theorem, as this is the number of roots of f , by Lemma 2.9.\nThe key to the proof of Lemma 2.9 is an alternative formula for the mapping degree\nof a continuous function \u03c6 : RP1 \u2192 RP1 . Suppose that p \u2208 RP1 is a point with finitely\nmany inverse images \u03c6\u22121 (p). To each inverse image we associate an index that records the\nbehavior of \u03c6(t) as t increases past the inverse image. The index is +1 if \u03c6(t) increases\npast p, it is \u22121 if \u03c6(t) decreases past p, and it is 0 if \u03c6 stays on the same side of p. (Here,\nincrease/decrease are taken with respect to the orientation of RP1 .) For example, here is a\ngraph of a function \u03c6 in relation to the value p with the indices of inverse images indicated.\n\u03c6\n\np\n\n0\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\n+1\n\nWith this definition, the mapping degree of \u03c6 is the sum of the indices of the points in a\nfiber \u03c6\u22121 (p), whenever the fiber is finite. That is,\nX\nmdeg(\u03c6) =\nindex of a .\na\u2208\u03c6\u22121 (p)\n\nProof of Lemma 2.9. The zeroes of the rational function \u03c6 := f /f \u2032 coincide with the zeroes\nof f . Suppose f (a) = 0 so that a lies in \u03c6\u22121 (0). The lemma will follow once we show that\na has index +1. Then we may write f (t) = (t \u2212 a)d h(t), where h is a polynomial with\nh(a) 6= 0. We see that f \u2032 (t) = d(t \u2212 a)d\u22121 h(t) + (t \u2212 a)d h\u2032 (t), and so\n\u03c6(t) =\n\nf (t)\n(t \u2212 a)h(t)\nt\u2212a\n=\n\u2248\n,\n\u2032\n\u2032\nf (t)\ndh(t) + (t \u2212 a)h (t)\nd\n\nthe last approximation being valid for t near a as h(t) 6= 0. Since d is positive, we see that\nthe index of the point a in the fiber \u03c6\u22121 (0) is +1.\nProof of Theorem 2.8. Suppose first that \u03c6 and \u03c8 are rational functions with no common\npoles. Then\nmdeg(\u03c6 + \u03c8) = mdeg(\u03c6) + mdeg(\u03c8) .\nTo see this, note that (\u03c6 + \u03c8)\u22121 (\u221e) is just the union of the sets \u03c6\u22121 (\u221e) and \u03c8 \u22121 (\u221e), and\nthe index of a pole of \u03c6 equals the index of the same pole of (\u03c6 + \u03c8).\nNext, observe that mdeg(\u03c6) = \u2212mdeg(1/\u03c6). For this, consider the behavior of \u03c6 and\n1/\u03c6 near the level set 1. If \u03c6 > 1 than 1/\u03c6 < 1 and vice-versa. The two functions\nhave index 0 at the same points, and opposite index at the remaining points in the fiber\n\u03c6\u22121 (1) = (1/\u03c6)\u22121 (1).\n23\n\n\fNow consider the mapping degree of \u03c6 = f /g as we construct its continued fraction\nexpansion. At the first step f = f0 g + h, so that \u03c6 = f0 + h/g. Since f0 is a polynomial, its\nonly pole is at \u221e, but as the degree of h is less than the degree of g, h/g does not have a\npole at \u221e. Thus the mapping degree of \u03c6 is\n\u0001\n\u0001\nmdeg(f0 + h/g) = mdeg(f0 ) + mdeg hg = mdeg(f0 ) \u2212 mdeg hg .\nThe theorem follows by induction, as mdeg(f0 ) = [f0 ].\n\nWe close this chapter with an application of this method. Suppose that we are given\ntwo polynomials f and g, and we wish to count the zeroes a of f where g(a) > 0. If\ng = (x \u2212 b)(x \u2212 c) with b < c, then this will count the zeroes of f in the interval [b, c],\nwhich we may do with either of the main results of this chapter. The question is much more\ngeneral, and it is not a priori clear how to use the methods in the first two sections of this\nchapter to solve this problem.\nA first step toward solving this problem is to compute the mapping degree of the rational\nfunction\nf\n\u03c6 :=\n.\ngf \u2032\nWe consider the indices of its zeroes. First, the zeroes of \u03c6 are those zeroes of f that are\nnot zeroes of g, together with a zero at infinity if deg(g) > 1. If f (a) = 0 but g(a) 6= 0, then\nf = (t \u2212 a)d h(t) with h(a) 6= 0. For t near a,\n\u03c6(t) \u2248\n\nt\u2212a\n,\nd * g(a)\n\nand so the preimage a \u2208 \u03c6\u22121 (0) has index sign (g(a)). If deg(g) = e > 1 and deg(f ) = d\nthen the asymptotic expansion of \u03c6 for t near infinity is\n\u03c6(t) \u2248\n\n1\n,\ndge te\u22121\n\nwhere ge is the leading coefficient of g. Thus the index of \u221e \u2208 \u03c6\u22121 (0) is sign (ge )(e\u22121\nmod 2) = [g \u2032 ]. We summarize this discussion.\nLemma 2.11 If deg(g) > 1, then\nX\n{a|f (a)=0}\n\nsign (g(a)) = mdeg(\u03c6) \u2212 [g \u2032] ,\n\nand if deg(g) = 1, the correction term \u2212[g \u2032 ] is omitted.\nSince mdeg(\u03c6) = \u2212mdeg(1/\u03c6), we have the alternative expression for this sum.\nLemma 2.12 Let q1 , q2 , . . . , qk be the successive quotients in the Euclidean algorithm applied\nto the division of f \u2032 g by f . Then\nX\nsign (g(a)) = [q2 ] \u2212 [q3 ] + * * * + (\u22121)k [qk ] .\n{a|f (a)=0}\n\n24\n\n\fProof. We have\nmdeg\n\nf \u2032g\nf\n=\n\u2212mdeg\n= \u2212[q1 ] + [q2 ] \u2212 * * * + (\u22121)k [qk ] ,\nf \u2032g\nf\n\nby Theorem 2.8. Note that we have f \u2032 g = q1 f + r1 . If we suppose that deg(f ) = d and\ndeg(g) = e, then deg(q1 ) = e \u2212 1. Also, the leading term of q is dge , where ge is the leading\nterm of g, which shows that [q1 ] = [g \u2032 ]. Thus the lemma follows from Lemma 2.11, when\ndeg(g) \u2265 2.\nBut it also follows when deg(g) < 2 as [q1 ] = 0 in that case.\nNow we may solve our problem. For simplicity, suppose that deg g > 1.

By B\u00e9zout's Theorem [10], this system has at\nmost d1 d2 * * * dn isolated complex solutions, and exactly that number if the polynomials are\ngeneric among all polynomials with the given degrees.\nPolynomials in nature (e.g. from applications) are not necessarily generic-they often\nhave some additional structure which we would like our count of solutions to reflect.\nExample 3.1 Consider the system of two polynomials in the variables x and y\nf := x2 y + 2xy 2 + xy \u2212 1 = 0 and g := x2 y \u2212 xy 2 \u2212 xy + 2 = 0 .\nSince these equations have the algebraic consequences,\nf * (y \u2212 x + 1) + g * (x + 2y + 1) = 3y + 3x + 1 ,\nand\nf * (3y 3 \u2212 3xy 2 + 5y 2 \u2212 2xy + 2y \u2212 3)\n+ g * (6y 3 + 3xy 2 + 7y 2 + 2xy + 2y + 3) = 9y 3 + 9y 2 + 2y + 9 ,\nwe see that the system has three solutions. (The linear consequence allows us to recover f\nand g from the cubic in y.)\nBoth polynomials f and g have degree three, but they only have three common solutions,\nwhich is fewer than the nine predicted by B\u00e9zout's Theorem. The key idea behind this deficit\nof 6 = 9 \u2212 3 is illustrated by plotting the exponent vectors of monomials which occur in the\npolynomials f and g.\n3\n2\n\nxy\nxy 2\nxy\n1\n\n\u2194\n\u2194\n\u2194\n\u2194\n\n(2, 1)\n(1, 2)\n(1, 1)\n(0, 0)\n\n2\n(3.2)\n\n1\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nThe Newton polytope of f (and of g) is the convex hull of these exponent vectors. This\ntriangle has area 23 and is covered by three lattice triangles. We will see why this number of\nlattice triangles equals the number of solutions to the original system.\n26\n\n\f3.1\n\nKushnirenko's Theorem\n\nThe polynomial system in Example 3.1 is a sparse system whose support is the set of integer\npoints in the triangle of (3.2). Let A \u2282 Zn be a finite set of exponent vectors which affinely\nspans Rn . A sparse polynomial f with support A is a linear combination\nX\nf =\nca xa\nca \u2208 R\na\u2208A\n\nof monomials from A. Let \u2206A \u2282 Rn be the convex hull of the vectors in A. Let T := C\u00d7 :=\nC \u2212 {0} be the algebraic torus. We recall Kushnirenko's Theorem from Chapter 1.\n\nKushnirenko's Theorem. A system (3.1) of n polynomials in n variables with common\nsupport A has at most n!vol(\u2206A ) isolated solutions in Tn , and exactly this number if the\npolynomials are generic given their support A.\nWe will give two proofs of this result, one using algebraic geometry that is due to Khovanskii and another which is algorithmic. Each proof introduces some important geometry\nrelated to sparse systems of polynomials.\nIt is worth remarking that while sparse polynomials occur naturally-multilinear or\nmultihomogeneous polynomials are an example-they also occur in problem formulations\ndue to human psychology. Most of us are unable to write down or reason with polynomials\nhaving thousands of terms, and we instead seek problem formulations with fewer terms.\n\n3.1.1\n\nThe geometry of sparse polynomial systems\n\nConsider the map\n\u03c6A : Tn \u220b x 7\u2212\u2192 [xa | a \u2208 A] \u2208 PA ,\n\nwhere PA is the projective space with homogeneous coordinates [za | a \u2208 A] indexed by A.\nThis map factors\nTn \u2212\u2192 TA \u2212\u0589 TA /\u03b4(T) \u2282 PA ,\n\nwhere TA = (C\u00d7 )|A| is the torus with coordinates indexed by A and \u03b4(T) \u2282 TA is the\ndiagonal torus. The quotient TA /\u03b4(T) is the dense torus in the projective space PA . It\nconsists of those points [za | a \u2208 A] \u2208 PA with no coordinate zero. Notice that \u03c6A is a\nhomomorphism into this dense torus. It is often convenient to identify A with the n \u00d7 |A|\nmatrix whose columns are the exponent vectors in A.\nExample 3.2 Suppose that A consists of the seven exponent vectors (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1),\n(1, 1), (\u22121, 0), (0, \u22121), and (\u22121, \u22121). Here is the corresponding matrix,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 1 1 0 \u22121 \u22121\n0\n.\n0 0 1 1\n0 \u22121 \u22121\n\n27\n\n\fThe convex hull \u2206A of these points is the hexagon,\n1\n\u22121\n1\n\u22121\nand the map \u03c6A is\n\u03c6A : (x, y) \u2208 T2 7\u2212\u2192 [1, x, y, xy, x\u22121, y \u22121, x\u22121 y \u22121] \u2208 PA = P6 .\nConsider a linear form \u039b on PA ,\n\u039b =\n\nX\n\nca za .\n\na\u2208A\n\nIts pullback \u03c6\u2217A (\u039b) along \u03c6A is a polynomial with support A,\nX\n\u03c6\u2217A (\u039b) =\nca xa .\na\u2208A\n\nThis provides a bijective correspondence between linear forms on PA and sparse polynomials with support A. Under \u03c6A , the zero set of a sparse polynomial is mapped to a\nhyperplane section of \u03c6A (Tn ) (the hyperplane is where the corresponding linear form vanishes). Since n general linear forms on PA cut out a linear subspace L of codimension n,\na general system (3.1) of sparse polynomials with support A is the pullback along \u03c6A of a\n\u22121\nn\ncodimension n linear section of \u03c6A (Tn ). That is, it equals \u03c6\u22121\nA (L) or \u03c6A (\u03c6(T ) \u2229 L).\n\u2020\nThe closure of the image of \u03c6A is the toric variety XA parameterized by the monomials\nA. Since \u03c6A is a homomorphism, the number dA of solutions to a general sparse system\nwith support A is the product\ndA = | ker(\u03c6A )| * deg(XA ) .\n\n(3.3)\n\nIndeed, if L is a general linear subspace of PA of codimension n, then Bertini's theorem\nimplies that \u03c6A (Tn )\u2229L = XA \u2229L and this intersection is transverse\u00a7 . When the intersection\nis not transverse, dA will be the sum of the multiplicities of the solutions. The number of\npoints in such a linear section is the degree deg(XA ) of XA , and each point pulls back under\n\u03c6A to | ker(\u03c6A )| solutions of the sparse system corresponding to the linear section.\n\u2020\n\nThere are competing notions of toric variety. We follow the convention from symbolic computation [122],\nrather than from algebraic geometry [40]. In particular, we do not assume that XA is normal.\n\u00a7\nThis transversality will also follow from the arguments given in our second proof of Kushnirenko's\nTheorem.\n\n28\n\n\f3.1.2\n\nAlgebraic-geometric proof of Kushnirenko's Theorem\n\nWe prove Kushnirenko's Theorem by showing that\nn! * vol(\u2206A ) = | ker(\u03c6A )| * deg(XA ) = dA .\nThis proof is due to Khovanskii [64] The same idea of proof is used by Khovanskii and\nKaveh [61], where they extend the theory of Newton polyhedra for functions on Tn to\nconvex bodies associated to functions on an arbitrary affine variety.\nWe first determine the kernel of the map \u03c6A , which is the composition\nTn \u2212\u2192 TA \u2212\u2192 TA /\u03b4(T) \u2282 PA\nx 7\u2212\u2192 (xa | a \u2208 A) .\nTo facilitate this computation, we assume that 0 \u2208 A. This is no loss of generality, for if\n0 6\u2208 A, then we simply translate A so that one of its exponent vectors is the origin. This has\nthe effect of multiplying each point in \u03c6A (Tn ) by a scalar, and so it does not change XA . It\nalso multiplies each polynomial in (3.1) by a common monomial, which affects neither the\nsolutions in Tn nor their number dA . By the relation (3.3), this translation does not change\nthe cardinality of the kernel of \u03c6A .\nSuppose that 0 \u2208 A. Then the z0 -coordinate of \u03c6A is constant (x0 = 1) and so the map\nwhich sends x \u2208 Tn to (xa | a \u2208 A) maps Tn into 1 \u00d7 TN \u2282 TA , where |A| = N + 1. The\ncomposition of the two maps\n\u0001\n1 \u00d7 TN \u2212\u2192 TA \u2212\u2192 TA /\u03b4(T) \u2282 PA\nis an isomorphism. Thus it is sufficient to compute the kernel of the map\n\u03c8A : Tn \u2212\u2192 TA ,\nx 7\u2212\u2192 (xa | a \u2208 A) ,\nwhen 0 \u2208 A.\nLet ZA \u2282 Zn be the sublattice spanned by the exponent vectors in A. It has full rank,\nby our assumption that A affinely spans Rn . Then the quotient Zn /ZA is a finite abelian\ngroup whose order is the lattice index [Zn : ZA]. Its group Hom(Zn /ZA, T) of characters\n(homomorphisms to T) is also called its Pontryagin dual. We have the sequence of abelian\ngroups,\n0 \u2212\u2192 ZA \u2212\u2192 Zn \u2212\u0589 Zn /ZA \u2212\u2192 0 .\nThis gives rise to the sequence of Pontryagin duals,\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 Hom(Zn /ZA, T) \u2212\u2192 Hom(Zn , T) \u2212\u2192 Hom(ZA, T) ,\nwhich is exact in that the image of Hom(Zn /ZA, T) in Hom(Zn , T) is the kernel of the last\nmap. If we identify Hom(Zn , T) with Tn , then this sequence of groups, or direct calculation,\nshows that\nHom(Zn /ZA, T) = {x \u2208 Tn | xa = 1 \u2200a \u2208 A} = ker(\u03c6A ) .\n29\n\n\fThus ker(\u03c6A ) is the Pontryagin dual to the quotient Zn /ZA. Since Zn /ZA is a finite abelian\ngroup, we see that\n| ker(\u03c6A )| = [Zn : ZA] = |Zn /ZA| .\n(3.4)\nThe Hilbert polynomial hX (d) a projective variety X is the polynomial which is eventually equal to the dimension of the dth graded piece of the homogeneous coordinate ring\nC[X] of X,\nhX (d) = dimC Cd [X] , for all d sufficiently large.\nThe Hilbert polynomial contains many numerical invariants of X. For example, the degree\nof the Hilbert polynomial is the dimension n of X and its leading coefficient is deg(X)/n!.\nFor a discussion of Hilbert polynomials, see Section 9.3 of [22].\nWe determine the Hilbert polynomial of the toric variety XA . For this, it is helpful to\nconsider the homogeneous version of the parametrization map \u03c6A . We lift A \u2282 Zn to a\nhomogenized set of exponent vectors A+ \u2282 1 \u00d7 Zn by prepending a component of 1 to each\nvector in A. That is,\nA+ := {(1, a) | a \u2208 A} .\nThe matrix A+ is obtained from the\nhexagon of Example 3.2, this is\n\uf8eb\n1\n+\n\uf8ed\n0\nA =\n0\n\nmatrix A by adding a new first row of 1s. For the\n\uf8f6\n1 1 1\n1\n1\n1\n1 1 0 \u22121 \u22121\n0 \uf8f8 .\n0 1 1\n0 \u22121 \u22121\n\nHere is the lifted hexagon, where the first coordinate is vertical.\n\nThe map \u03c6A+ on Tn has the same image in PA as does \u03c6A . The advantage is that the\nimage of the map \u03c6A+ in CA is stable under multiplication by scalars-this is built into\nit via the new first coordinate of A+ . If we let t be the first coordinate of T1+n , then the\npullback of the coordinate ring of PA to the ring of Laurent polynomials (the coordinate\nring of T1+n ) is\nSA := C[txa | a \u2208 A] \u2243 C[NA+ ] .\nThis is also the homogeneous coordinate ring of the toric variety XA = \u03c6A (T1+n ) (the closure\ntaken in PA ).\nThe grading on SA is given by the exponent of the variable t. It follows that the dth\ngraded piece of SA has a basis of monomials\n{td * xa | a \u2208 dA} ,\n30\n\n\fwhere dA is the set of d-fold sums of vectors in A. This is just the set of integer points in\nd\u2206A which lie in the nonnegative integer span NA of A. If we let HA (d) be the dimension\nof the dth graded piece of the homogeneous coordinate ring of XA (also called the Hilbert\nfunction of XA ), then these arguments show that\nHA (d) = |d\u2206A \u2229 NA|.\nWe will estimate this Hilbert function, which will enable us to determine the leading coefficient of the Hilbert polynomial, as the Hilbert function and Hilbert polynomial agree for d\nsufficiently large.\nLet \u039b \u2243 Zn be a lattice in Rn and \u2206 be a polytope with vertices in \u039b. Ehrhart [28]\nshowed that the counting function\nP\u2206 : N \u220b d 7\u2212\u2192 |d\u2206 \u2229 \u039b|\nfor the points of \u039b contained in positive integer multiples of the polytope \u2206 is a polynomial\nin d. This polynomial is called the Ehrhart polynomial of the polytope \u2206, and its degree is\nthe dimension of the affine span of \u2206. When \u2206 has dimension n, its leading coefficient is\nthe volume of \u2206, normalized so that a fundamental domain of the lattice \u039b has volume 1.\nThat is, it is the Euclidean volume divided by the lattice index [Zn : ZA]. When \u039b = Zn ,\nthis is the ordinary Euclidean volume of \u2206.\nNow suppose that \u2206 = \u2206A , the convex hull of A. Since dA \u2282 d\u2206A \u2229 ZA, if \u039b = ZA,\nwe have\nP\u2206A (d) \u2265 HA (d) .\n(3.5)\nWe give a lower bound for HA (d). Let B be the points b in ZA which may be written as\nX\nb =\nca a ,\na\u2208A\n\nwhere ca is a rational number in [0, 1). Fix an expression for each b \u2208 B as an integer linear\ncombination of elements of A, and let \u2212N with N \u2265 0 be an integer lower bound for the\ncoefficients in these expressions for the finitely many elements\nPof B.\nFor d \u2265 N|A| we claim that translation by the vector N a\u2208A a defines a map\nZA \u2229 (d \u2212 N|A|)\u2206A \u2212\u2192 NA \u2229 d\u2206A .\n\nIndeed, a point v \u2208 ZA \u2229 (d \u2212 N|A|)\u2206A is a nonnegative rational combination of the P\nvectors\nin A. Taking fractional parts gives v = b + c, where b \u2208 B and c \u2208 NA. Adding N a\u2208A a\nto the fixed integral expression of b gives a positive integral expression, which proves the\nclaim. This shows that\nHA (d) \u2265 P\u2206A (d \u2212 N|A|) .\nIf we combine this estimate with (3.5), and use the result that the Hilbert function equals\nthe Hilbert polynomial for d large enough, then we have shown that the Hilbert polynomial\nhA of XA has the same degree and leading coefficient as the Ehrhart polynomial P\u2206A .\n31\n\n\fThus the Hilbert polynomial has degree n and its leading coefficient is vol(\u2206A )/[Zn : ZA],\nwhich is the normalized volume of the polytope \u2206A with respect to the lattice ZA. We\nconclude that the degree of XA is\nvol(\u2206A )\n.\nn! n\n[Z : ZA]\nRecall (3.4) that the kernel of \u03c6A has order [Zn : ZA]. Then the formula (3.3) for the\nnumber dA of solutions to a sparse system (3.1) with support A becomes\ndA = | ker(\u03c6A )| * deg(XA ) = [Zn : ZA] * n!\n\nvol(\u2206A )\n= n! vol(\u2206A ) ,\n[Zn : ZA]\n\nwhich proves Kushnirenko's Theorem.\n\n3.2\n\nAlgorithmic proof of Kushnirenko's Theorem\n\nWe present a second proof of Kushnirenko's Theorem whose advantage is that it introduces\nmore geometry connected to toric varieties (which will be useful in subsequent chapters),\nin particular, the proof uses toric degenerations (sometimes called Gr\u00f6bner degenerations).\nThese toric degenerations underlie the method of Viro [130, 121], which is important for\nmany constructions in real algebraic geometry. We first analyze the simplest case of Kushnirenko's Theorem-when |A| = n + 1.\n\n3.2.1\n\nKushnirenko's Theorem for a simplex\n\nSuppose that |A| = n + 1 so that \u2206A is a simplex with vertices A. Then XA = Pn = PA .\nAs we saw, the solutions to any sparse system (3.1) with support A have the form \u03c6\u22121\nA (L),\nn\nwhere L \u2282 P is the codimension-n plane cut out by the linear forms which define the\npolynomials of the system. In this case L is simply a point \u03b2 \u2208 Pn (which lies in the dense\ntorus as the equations are general), and the solutions have the form \u03c6\u22121\nA (\u03b2). Since \u03c6A is a\nA\nhomomorphism to the dense torus of P , these solutions form a single coset of ker(\u03c6A ).\nWe may determine these solutions explicitly. Assume that 0 \u2208 A. Since |A| = n + 1, we\nmay write the sparse system (3.1) as\nC * (xa1 , xa2 , . . . , xan )T = b ,\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhere A \u2212 {0} = {a1 , a2 , . . . , an }, C is the n by n matrix of coefficients, and b \u2208 Cn . If our\nsystem is generic, then C is invertible and we may perform row operations on C and hence\non the system (3.6) to obtain an equivalent binomial system\nxai = \u03b2i\n\nfor i = 1, . . . , n .\n\n(3.6)\u2032\n\nwhere \u03b21 , . . . , \u03b2n \u2208 T, and so the system has the form \u03c6\u22121\nA (\u03b2). (In fact, the requirements\nthat C be invertible and that the resulting constants \u03b2i \u2208 T are the conditions for genericity\nof this system.)\nLet A be the n by n matrix whose columns are the exponent vectors in A \u2212 {0}. We\nwill see how the integer linear algebra of the matrix A is used to solve the system (3.6)\u2032 .\n32\n\n\fExample 3.3 Consider the system of equations with support A = {(16, 14), (22, 18), (0, 0)}\n23x16 y 14 \u2212 x22 y 18 = \u221227 ,\n\nand\n\n35x16 y 14 \u2212 x22 y 18 = \u22129 .\n\n(3.7)\n\nSubtracting the two equations gives the binomial,\n12x16 y 14 = 36\n\nor\n\nx16 y 14 = 3 ,\n\nand solving for x22 y 18 gives x22 y 18 = 96. Thus we have the equivalent binomial system\nx16 y 14 = 3\n\nand\n\nx22 y 18 = 96 .\n\n(3.8)\n\nUnder the invertible substitution (the inverse is given by u = x8 y 7 and v = (xy)\u22121 )\nx = uv 7\n\nand\n\ny = u\u22121 v \u22128 ,\n\n(3.9)\n\nour equations become triangular\n(uv 7 )16 (u\u22121v \u22128 )14 = u16 v 112 u\u221214 v \u2212112 = u2\n= 3 , and\n7 22 \u22121 \u22128 18\n22 154 \u221218 \u2212144\n4 10\n(uv ) (u v )\n= u v u v\n= uv\n= 96 .\n\n(3.10)\n\nWhile the solution is now immediate via back substitution, we make one further simplifying\nsubstitution. Write f for the first equation and g for the second. Replacing g by gf \u22122 yields\na diagonal system which is now completely trivial to solve\nf\ngf\n\n\u22122\n\n: u2 = 3 ,\n: v 10 = 32/3 .\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\nThe solutions are u = \u00b1 3 and v = \u03b6 2, where \u03b6 runs over all 10th roots of 13 . Substituting\nthese into (3.9), gives the 20 solutions to our original system of equations (3.7).\nUnderlying these simplifications is the relation between the integer linear algebra of n\nby n matrices and (multiplicative) coordinate changes in Tn . Since Tn = Hom(Zn , T), its\nautomorphism group is GL(n, Z), the group of invertible n by n integer matrices, and this\nis the source of that relation.\nExample 3.4 The monomials in (3.8) correspond to the columns of the matrix\n\u0012\n\u0013\n16 22\nA =\n,\n14 18\nand the coordinate change (3.9) corresponds to left multiplication (hence row operations)\nby the matrix\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 \u22121\n.\n7 \u22128\n33\n\n\fIndeed,\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0012\n2 4\n16 22\n1 \u22121\n,\n=\n0 10\n14 18\n7 \u22128\n\nwhich corresponds to the exponent vectors in the triangular system (3.10). This upper\ntriangular matrix is the Hermite normal form of the matrix A-the row reduced echelon\nform over Z. This notion makes sense for matrices whose entries lie in any principal ideal\ndomain.\nMultiplicative reductions using the equations correspond to multiplicative coordinate\nchanges in the target torus T2 and are represented by column operations, or right multiplication by integer matrices.

These are called the invariant factors of A, and we have d1 |d2 | * * * |dn . Then\nZn /ZA \u2243 Z/d1 Z \u00d7 Z/d2 Z \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Z/dn Z ,\nthe canonical way to write a finite abelian group. As with the Hermite normal form, the\nSmith normal form makes sense for presentations of modules over any principal ideal domain.\n\n3.2.2\n\nRegular triangulations and toric degenerations\n\nLet \u03c9 : A \u2192 N. This is a weight for T acting diagonally on the space CA , if z = (za | a \u2208\nA) \u2208 CA , then t.z = (t\u03c9(a) za | a \u2208 A). This induces a similar action on PA , and a dual\naction on the homogeneous coordinate ring C[za | a \u2208 A] of PA , namely\nt.za = t\u2212\u03c9(a) za\n\nfor a \u2208 A ,\n\nwhere za is a variable (coordinate function on CA ). Let XA \u2282 C \u00d7 PA be the closure of the\nfamily over T of deformations of the toric variety XA under this action,\nXA := {(t, t.z) \u2282 C \u00d7 PA | t \u2208 T , z \u2208 XA } .\nThis is a flat family over C [29, Ch. 15]. (This technical fact implies that all fibers have the\nsame Hilbert polynomial.) The fiber of XA over a point t \u2208 T is the translated toric variety\nt.XA , and the fiber over 0 \u2208 C is called the scheme-theoretic limit of the family t.XA , which\nis written\nlim t.XA .\nt\u21920\n\nWe use geometric combinatorics to study this limit. The passage from XA to such a schemetheoretic limit of an action of T is a toric degeneration.\n34\n\n\fWe may also use the weight \u03c9 : A \u2192 N to lift the vector configuration A into R1+n .\nConsider the convex hull P\u03c9 in R1+n of the lifted vectors\nP\u03c9 := conv{(w(a), a) | a \u2208 A} .\n\n(3.11)\n\nThe lower facets of this polytope are those facets of P\u03c9 whose outward-pointing normal\nvector has a negative first coordinate. Projecting these lower facets back to Rn gives the\nfacets in the regular polyhedral subdivision \u2206\u03c9 of the convex hull of A induced by the lifting\nfunction \u03c9. The vertices in this subdivision are some of the vectors in A. While much of\nthe following makes sense for general polyhedral subdivisions, we shall henceforth assume\nthat \u2206\u03c9 is a triangulation in that each lower facet is a simplex. (This is a mild genericity\nassumption on \u03c9.) We display the lower facets and the resulting triangulation \u2206\u03c9 for a\nweight function \u03c9 on where A = {(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (2, 0), (1, 1), (0, 2)}.\n\nExponent vectors \u03b1 of monomials in the coordinate ring C[za | a \u2208 A] of PA are elements\nof NA , and \u03c9 induces a linear form on NA ,\nX\n\u03c9 * \u03b1 := \u03c9 * (\u03b1a | a \u2208 A) =\n\u03c9(a)\u03b1a .\na\u2208A\n\nThe initial form in\u03c9 (g) of a homogeneous form g(z) \u2208 C[za | a \u2208 A] is the sum of the\nterms c\u03b1 z \u03b1 of g for which \u03c9 * \u03b1 is maximal among all terms of g. Let \u03c9(g) be this maximal\nvalue. Multiplying t.g by t\u03c9(g) we see that\nt\u03c9(g) (t.g(z)) = in\u03c9 g(z) + h ,\nwhere h is divisible by t. Thus\nlim t\u03c9(g) (t.g(z)) = in\u03c9 g(z) .\nt\u21920\n\nWrite IA for the ideal defining XA . (This toric ideal has a linear basis of binomials z \u03b1 \u2212z \u03b2\nsuch that A+ \u03b1 = A+ \u03b2, where A is the matrix whose columns are the exponent vectors in\nA+ [122, Lemma 4.1].) These binomials have the following geometric interpretation. The\nproduct A+ \u03b1 is a positive linear combination of the vectors in A+ , so binomials z \u03b1 \u2212z \u03b2 in IA\nrecord vectors in NA that have two distinct representations as positive linear combinations\n35\n\n\fof the vectors in A+ . If we divide by the the initial coordinate of the vector A+ \u03b1, we obtain\na vector of the form (1, x), where x is a rational point lying in the convex hull of A. When\nA+ \u03b1 = A+ \u03b2, this pont x has two distinct rational representations as a convex combination\nof elements of A. Thus x lies in the convex hulls of two different subsets of A. Conversely,\nany such point gives rise to a binomial z \u03b1 \u2212 z \u03b2 \u2208 IA .\nWhen \u03c9 * \u03b1 > \u03c9 * \u03b2, then z \u03b1 is the initial term in\u03c9 (z \u03b1 \u2212 z \u03b2 ). The initial ideal of IA is\nin\u03c9 (IA ) = {in\u03c9 (g) | g \u2208 IA } .\nSince the ideal I(t.XA ) of t.XA is\nI(t.XA ) = {t.g(y) | g \u2208 I(XA )} = t.IA ,\nwe see that\nlim t.IA = in\u03c9 (IA ) .\nt\u21920\n\nThus this initial ideal is the ideal of the scheme-theoretic limit of the family t.XA .\n\n3.2.3\n\nKushnirenko's Theorem via toric degenerations\n\nSince the family XA \u2192 C is flat, every fiber has the same degree, and so Kushnirenko's\nTheorem follows if we can prove that the degree of the limit scheme in\u03c9 (XA ) is n!vol(\u2206A )\ndivided by the degree [Zn : ZA] of \u03c6A . It is proved in Chapter 8 of [122] that\n\\\np\nin\u03c9 (IA ) =\nhza | a 6\u2208 \u03c4 i ,\n(3.12)\n\u03c4\n\nthe intersection over all facet n-simplices \u03c4 of the regular triangulation of \u2206A . This result is\nnot so hard. If the segment ab for a, b \u2208 A is not a face of the triangulation \u2206\u03c9 , then it crosses\na minimal face conv(\u03c4 ) of the triangulation. This implies that there is a binomial zaN zbM \u2212z \u03b3 ,\nwhere M, N are positive integers and the monomial z \u03b3 involves the variables in \u03c4 . By the\nconstruction of the triangulation \u2206\u03c9 , the corresponding lifted segment (\u03c9(a), a), (\u03c9(b), b) of\nN M\nP\u03c9 lies above the lift of the face\npconv(\u03c4 ), and thus the initial term of this binomial is za zb ,\nand so za zb lies in the radical in\u03c9 (IA ) of the initial ideal.\nIt follows that the limit scheme in\u03c9 (XA ) is supported on the union of coordinate n-planes\n\u03c4\nP , one for each facet n-simplex \u03c4 of the regular triangulation. (Here P\u03c4 is the coordinate\nplane which is spanned by the coordinates indexed by \u03c4 .) The degree of this initial scheme\nis then\nX\ndeg(in\u03c9 (XA )) =\nmultP\u03c4 (in\u03c9 (XA )) ,\n\u03c4\n\nthe sum over these facets \u03c4 of the algebraic multiplicity of the limit scheme in\u03c9 (XA ) along\nthe coordinate n-plane P\u03c4 .\nIn [122, Chapter 8], and under the (mild) assumption that A is primitive (ZA = Zn ),\nSturmfels shows that this multiplicity is n!vol(\u2206\u03c4 ). Since these facets cover \u2206A , the degree\nof the limit scheme in\u03c9 (XA ) is n!vol(\u2206A ). As the family XA is flat, this degree is the degree\nof XA , and we may deduce Kushnirenko's Theorem from this.\nBefore we continue, we deduce a corollary from this. A triangulation of a polytope in\nRn is unimodular is every facet has minimal volume 1/n!.\n36\n\n\fCorollary 3.5 Suppose that \u2206\u03c9 is a regular unimodular triangulation. Then the limit\nscheme of the corresponding flat toric degeneration is a union of coordinate n-planes, one\nfor every facet \u03c4 of \u2206\u03c9 ,\n[\nP\u03c4 .\nlim t.xA =\nt\u21920\n\n\u03c4 \u2208\u2206\u03c9\n\nWe give a different proof which is adapted from [105] and does not assume primitivity.\nIts limitation is that it only works over C as it uses metric properties of C and not an\narbitrary algebraically closed field.\nThe main idea is to fix a general linear subspace L of codimension n in PA and consider\nthe family of linear sections L \u2229 t.XA of fibers of the flat family XA , for t near 0. This is\nillustrated in Figure 3.1. The subspace L will meet each facet n-plane P\u03c4 in a single point\nP\u03c4\n\u03c0\u03c4\u22121 (p\u03c4 )\n\n1\n\u0010\u0010\n\np\u03c4 \u0010\n\nL\np\u03c3\nt.XA\n\n\u0002\n\n\u0002\n\n\u0002\n\nP\u03c3\n\nFigure 3.1: Points in L \u2229 t.XA near P\u03c4 for small t.\np\u03c4 , and the points of L \u2229 t.XA for t small will be clustered near the different points p\u03c4 .\nWe could determine the number of points clustered near one of the p\u03c4 , which is the\nalgebraic multiplicity, multP\u03c4 (in\u03c9 (XA )). It is in fact easier to determine the number of\n\u22121\npoints in Tn of the form \u03c6\u22121\nA (t .x), for x a point clustered near one of the p\u03c4 and when t\nis small. This is more direct, and it bypasses computing this algebraic multiplicity. This is\nalso where we avoid the assumption of primitivity, but must work over C.\nNote that in a neighborhood of P\u03c4 , the linear space L is isotopic to \u03c0\u03c4\u22121 (p\u03c4 ), which is a\nfiber of the coordinate projection \u03c0\u03c4 : PA \u2212 \u2192 P\u03c4 . This is a rational map not defined on the\nlinear span of coordinates {za | a 6\u2208 \u03c4 }. It follows that the number of points in Tn coming\nfrom points in the linear section L \u2229 t.XA near p\u03c4 is equal to the number of points in Tn\ncoming from points in the linear section \u03c0\u03c4\u22121 (p\u03c4 ) \u2229 t.XA near p\u03c4 . This is simply the degree\nof the map which is the composition of the parametrization \u03c6A of XA , the map z 7\u2192 t.z on\nPA , and this projection \u03c0\u03c4 ,\n\u03c6A\n\nt\n\n\u03c0\n\nTn \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 XA \u2212\u2192 t.XA \u2212\u2212\u03c4\u2192 P\u03c4 .\nSince multiplication by t is homotopic to the identity and it commutes with the projection\n\u03c0\u03c4 , we may assume now that t = 1, and so this composition is nothing other than the\n37\n\n\fparametrization \u03c6\u03c4 of P\u03c4 by the monomials corresponding to integer points of \u03c4 . The degree\nof this map is the order of the kernel of \u03c6\u03c4 , which is n! * vol(\u2206\u03c4 ). Summing this quantity\nover all facets \u03c4 of the triangulation shows that there are\nX\nn! * vol(\u2206\u03c4 ) = n!vol(\u2206A )\n\u03c4\n\npoints in Tn which are pullbacks under \u03c6A of the linear section L \u2229 XA . This completes our\nalgorithmic proof of Kushnirenko's Theorem.\nThe reason that it is algorithmic is that it (more-or-less) counts the solutions to the\nsystem L \u2229 t.XA , for t small, while also giving enough information on their location and\nstructure to determine them numerically so that they may become the input to the polyhedral homotopy method [52, 129] for computing the solutions at t = 1.\nNote that this proof also shows that the intersection XA \u2229 L is transverse when L is\ngeneral, and thus gives a proof of Bertini's Theorem in this context. Since, for t small, the\nintersection near p\u03c4 may be deformed to the intersection of XA with the horizontal subspaces\n\u03c0\u03c4\u22121 (p\u03c4 ), and this is deformed to the system \u03c6\u22121\n\u03c4 (p\u03c4 ), which consists of n vol(\u2206\u03c4 ) distinct\npoints, the general such intersection is transverse.\n\n3.2.4\n\nA brief aside about real solutions\n\nObserve that if the triangulation \u2206\u03c9 is unimodular, in that each facet has minimal volume\n1/n!, then near each point p\u03c4 there will be exactly one point of L \u2229 t.XA and one corresponding solution in Tn . If both L and t are real, then each p\u03c4 and each nearby point in\nt.XA will be real. Since\n\u0001\nt\u22121 .(L \u2229 t.XA ) = t\u22121 .L \u2229 XA ,\n\nand the points in the left hand side are all real, so are the points in the right hand side. This\nright hand side corresponds to a system of real polynomials with support A. This proves a\ntheorem of Sturmfels [120], and gives his argument in a nutshell.\n\nTheorem 1.8 If a lattice polytope \u2206 \u2282 Zn admits a regular unimodular triangulation, then\nthere exist real polynomial systems with support \u2206 \u2229 Zn having all solutions real.\n\nA more careful analysis, which begins by examining real solutions when |A| = n + 1,\nleads to the more refined result for not necessarily unimodular triangulations that appears\nin Sturmfels's paper.\n\n38\n\n\fChapter 4:\nUpper Bounds\nRecall Descartes rule of signs ([24] or Section 2.1), which gives a bound for the number of\npositive solutions to a univariate polynomial.\nTheorem 2.1 (Descartes's rule of signs) The number, r, of positive roots of a univariate\npolynomial\nf (x) = c0 xa0 + c1 xa1 + * * * + cm xam ,\n(4.1)\ncounted with multiplicity, is bounded above by the number of variations in sign of the coefficients of f ,\n#{i | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m and ci\u22121 ci < 0} \u2264 r ,\nand the difference between the variation and r is even.\nIn (4.1) we assume that a0 < a1 < * * * < am and no coefficient ci vanishes.\nThus a univariate polynomial with m + 1 monomials has at most m positive roots. This\nbound is sharp, as the polynomial\n(x \u2212 1)(x \u2212 2) * * * (x \u2212 m)\n\n(4.2)\n\nhas m + 1 distinct terms and m positive roots. Replacing x by x2 gives a polynomial with\nm+1 terms and 2m nonzero real roots.\nThis chapter and the next will discuss extensions of this Descartes bound to systems of\nmultivariate polynomials.\n\n4.1\n\nKhovanskii's fewnomial bound\n\nDescartes's rule of signs suggests that the number of real roots to a system of polynomials\ndepends not on its degree, but rather on the complexity of its description. D. Bernstein\nand A. Kushnirenko formulated the principle that the topological complexity of a set in Rn\ndefined by real polynomials is controlled by the complexity of the description of the polynomials, rather than by their degree or Newton polytopes. This is exactly what Khovanskii\nfound in 1980 with his celebrated fewnomial bound.\nTheorem 4.1 (Khovanskii [65]) A system of n real polynomials in n variables involving\nl+n+1 distinct monomials will have at most\n2(\n\n) * (n + 1)l+n\n\nl+n\n2\n\nnondegenerate positive solutions.\n\n39\n\n(4.3)\n\n\fWe remark that nondegenerate solutions are isolated, and there are finitely many of\nthem. This bound, like other bounds in this part of the subject, considers solutions in the\npositive orthant Rn> . A consequence of Khovanskii's bound is that for each l and n, there is a\nnumber X(l, n) which is equal to the maximum number of positive solutions to a system of n\npolynomials in n variables having l+n+1 distinct monomials. A central question in this area\nis to determine the Khovanskii number X(l, n) exactly, or give good bounds. Khovanskii's\nTheorem shows that X(l, n) is bounded above by the quantity (4.3).\nA complete proof of Theorem 4.1 may be found in Khovanskii's book [66], where much\nelse is also developed. Chapter 1 of that book contains an accessible sketch. Benedetti\nand Risler [5, \u00a74.1] have a careful and self-contained exposition of Khovanskii's fewnomial\nbound. We give a sketch of the main ideas in the exposition of Benedetti and Risler, to\nwhich we refer for further details (this is also faithful to Khovanskii's sketch). We remark\nthat Sturmfels has also sketched ([124, pp. 39\u201340] and in [123]) a version of the proof. This\nomits some contributions to the root count and is therefore regrettably incorrect.\nKhovanskii looks for solutions in the positive orthant Rn> , proving a far more general\nresult involving solutions in Rn of polynomial functions in logarithms of the coordinates and\nmonomials. For this, he took logarithms of the coordinates. Set\nzi := log(xi )\n\nyj := ez*aj = xaj ,\n\nand\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhere i = 1, . . . , n, j = 1, . . . , k, and aj \u2208 Rn can be real exponents.

Given a system of n real polynomials in n variables involving l+n+1\ndistinct monomials, we may assume that one of the monomials is 1. Under the substitution (4.4), this becomes a system of the form (4.5), where each Fi is a degree 1 polynomial\nin k = l + n variables. Then deg Fi = 1 and the bound (4.6) reduces to (4.3).\nSketch of proof of Theorem 4.2. We proceed by induction on k, skipping some technicalities\ninvolving Sard's Theorem. When k = 0, there are no exponentials, and the system is just a\nsystem of n polynomials in n variables, whose number of nondegenerate isolated solutions\nis bounded above by the B\u00e9zout number,\nn\nY\n\ndeg Fi ,\n\ni=1\n\n40\n\n\fwhich is the bound (4.6) when k = 0.\nSuppose that we have the bound (4.6) for systems of the form (4.5) with k exponentials,\nand consider a system with k+1 exponentials and one added variable t.\nGi (z, t) := Fi (z1 , . . . , zn , y1 , . . . , yk , t * yk+1) = 0\nt = 1\n\ni = 1, . . . , n\n\n(4.7)\n\nThe subsystem (4.7) defines an analytic curve C in Rn+1 , which we assume is smooth and\ntransverse to the hyperplane at t = 1.\nWrite zn+1 for t and consider the vector field \u03be in Rn+1 whose rth component is\n\u0013i=1,...,n\n\u0012\n\u2202Gi\nn+1\u2212r\n.\n(4.8)\n\u03ber := (\u22121)\ndet\n\u2202zj j=1,...,r\u0302,...,n+1\nThis vector field is tangent to the curve C, and we write \u03bet = \u03ben+1 for its component in the\nt-direction. An important ingredient in our proof of Theorem 4.2 is a special case of the\nKhovanskii-Rolle Theorem [66, pp. 42\u201351].\nTheorem 4.3 (Khovanskii-Rolle Theorem) The number of points of C where t = 1 is\nbounded above by\nN + q,\nwhere N is the number of points of C where \u03bet = 0 and q is the number of unbounded\ncomponents of C.\nProof. Note that \u03bet varies continuously along C. Suppose that a and b are consecutive\npoints along an arc of C where t = 1. Since C is transverse to the hyperplane t = 1, we have\n\u03bet (a) * \u03bet (b) < 0, and so there is a point c of C on the arc between a and b with \u03bet (c) = 0.\nThe hyperplane t = 1 cuts a compact connected component of C into the same number\nof arcs as points where t = 1. Since the endpoints of each arc lie on the hyperplane t = 1,\nthere is at least one point c on each arc with \u03bet (c) = 0. Similarly, the hyperplane t = 1\ncuts a noncompact component into arcs, and each arc with two endpoints in the hyperplane\nt = 1 gives a point c with \u03bet (c) = 0. However, there will be one more point with t = 1 on\nthis component than such arcs.\nWe illustrate the argument in the proof below.\n\u001b\n\n\u03bet = 0\nC\n\n?\n\nt=1\n\nXX\ny\n\n:\n\u03bet = 0 \u0018\u0018\n\n41\n\n\fThe key to the induction in the proof of Khovanskii's formula is to replace the last\nexponential by a new variable. This substitution is omitted in Sturmfels's argument, which\nalso does not use the Khovanskii-Rolle Theorem 4.3. Since we have\n\u2202Fi\n\u2202Gi\n=\n(z1 , . . . , zn , y1 , . . . , yk , tyk+1 )\n\u2202zr\n\u2202zr\nk\nX\n\u2202Fi\n+\n(z1 , . . . , zn , y1 , . . . , yk , t yk+1) * aj,r yj\n\u2202yj\nj=1\n+\n\n\u2202Fi\n(z1 , . . . , zn , y1 , . . . , yk , t yk+1) * ak+1,r t yk+1 ,\n\u2202yk+1\n\nif we set u := tyk+1 and define \u03c6(z, u) to be the expression for \u03bet = \u03ben+1 (4.8) written in\nterms of z and u, then the total degree (in z1 , . . . , zn , y1 , . . . , yk , u) of \u03c6t (z, u) is at most\nP\nn\ni=1 deg Fi .\nThus number N of Theorem 4.3 is the number of solutions to the system\nFi (z1 , . . . , zn , y1 , . . . , yk , u) = 0\n\ni = 1, . . . , n\n\n\u03c6t (z, u) = 0 .\n\n(4.9)\n\nThis has the form (4.5) with k exponentials. Given any solution to the system (4.9), we use\nthe substitution u = tyk+1 to solve for t and get a corresponding point c on the curve C with\n\u03bet (c) = 0. We apply our induction hypothesis to the system (4.9) (which has k exponentials\nand n+1 equations in n+1 variables) to obtain\nN \u2264\n\nn\nY\ni=1\n\ndeg Fi *\n\nn\n\u0010X\ni=1\n\nn\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0011k\nX\nk\ndeg Fi * 1 + 2\ndeg Fi * 2(2) .\ni=1\n\nWe similarly estimate the number q of noncompact components of C. We claim that this\nis bounded above by the maximum number of points of intersection of C with a hyperplane.\nIndeed, since each noncompact component has two infinite branches, there are 2q points\n(counted with multiplicity) on the sphere S n corresponding to directions of accumulation\npoints of the branches of C at infinity. Any hyperplane through the origin not meeting these\npoints will have at least q of these points in one of the hemispheres into which it divides\nthe sphere. If we translate this hyperplane sufficiently far toward infinity, it will meet the\nbranches giving these accumulation points, and thus will meet C in at least q points.\nThus q is bounded by the number of solutions to a system of the form\nFi (z1 , . . . , zn , y1 , . . . , yk , u) = 0\n\ni = 1, . . . , n\n\nl0 + l1 z1 + l2 z2 + * * * + ln zn + lu u = 0 ,\n\n(4.10)\n\nwhere l0 , . . . , ln , lu are some real numbers.

Also, the bound is not sharp. While no one believed that Khovanskii's\nbound (4.3) was anywhere near the actual upper bound X(l, n), it was been extremely hard\nto improve it. We discuss the first steps in this direction.\n\n4.2\n\nKushnirenko's conjecture\n\nOne of the first proposals of a more reasonable bound than Khovanskii's for the number of\npositive solutions to a system of polynomials was due to Kushnirenko, and for many years\nexperts believed that this may indeed be the truth.\nConjecture 4.4 (Kushnirenko) A system f1 = f2 = * * * = fn = 0 of real polynomials\nwhere each fi has mi +1 terms has at most m1 m2 * * * mn nondegenerate positive solutions.\nThis generalizes the bound given by Descartes's rule of signs. It easy to use the example (4.2) for the sharpness of Descartes's rule to construct systems of the form\nf1 (x1 ) = f2 (x2 ) = * * * = fn (xn ) = 0 ,\n43\n\n\fwhich achieve the bound of Conjecture 4.4.\nSoon after Kushnirenko made this conjecture, K. Sevostyanov found a counterexample which was unfortunately lost. Nevertheless, this conjecture passed into folklore until\nHaas [48] found a simple example of two trinomials (3 = 2 + 1) in variables x and y with\n5 (> 4 = 2 * 2) isolated nondegenerate positive solutions.\n10x106 + 11y 53 \u2212 11y = 10y 106 + 11x53 \u2212 11x = 0 .\n\n(4.11)\n\nThere have been other attempts to find better bounds than the Khovanskii bound.\nSturmfels [120] used the toric degenerations introduced in Chapter 3 to show how to construct systems with many real roots (the root count depends upon a mixture the geometry\nof the Newton polytopes and some combinatorics of signs associated to lattice points)\u2020 . This\ninspired Itenberg and Roy [55] to propose a multivariate version of Descartes's rule of signs,\nwhich was later found to be too optimistic [75]. An interesting part of this story is told in\nthe cheeky paper of Lagarias and Richardson [71].\nMore recently, Li, Rojas, and Wang looked closely at Haas's counterexample to Kushnirenko's conjecture, seeking to obtain realistic bounds for the number of positive solutions\nwhich depended only on the number of monomials in the different polynomials. For example,\nthey showed that Haas's counterexample was the best possible.\nTheorem 4.5 (Li, Rojas, and Wang [74]) A system consisting of two trinomials in two\nvariables has at most 5 nondegenerate positive solutions.\nDickenstein, Rojas, Rusek, and Shih [25] used exact formulas for A-discriminants [26] to\nstudy systems of two trinomials in two variables which achieve this bound of five positive\nsolutions. They gave the following example, which indicates how difficult it is to find systems\nwith many real solutions.\nExample 4.6 Consider the family of systems of bivariate sextics,\nx6 + ay 3 \u2212 y = y 6 + bx3 \u2212 x = 0 ,\n\n(4.12)\n\nwhere a, b are real numbers. When a = b = 78/55, this has five positive real solutions\n(0.8136, 0.6065) , (0.7888, 0.6727) , (0.7404, 0.7404) , (0.6727, 0.7888) , (0.6065, 0.8136) .\nWe now investigate the set of parameters (a, b) for which this achieves the trinomial bound of\nfive positive solutions. This turns out to be a single connected component in the complement\nof the discriminant for this family of systems. This discriminant is a polynomial of degree\n90 in a, b with 58 terms whose leading and trailing terms are\n1816274895843482705708030487016037960921088a45b45 + * * * 56 terms * * * +\n1102507499354148695951786433413508348166942596435546875.\n\u2020\n\nActually, he used the toric proof of Bernstein's Theorem.\n\n44\n\n\fWe display this discriminant in the square [0, 4] \u00d7 [0, 4], as well as three successive magnifications, each by a factor of 11. The shaded region in the last picture is the set of pairs (a, b)\nfor which (4.12) achieves the trinomial bound of five positive real solutions.\n\nTo compare the trinomial bound in [74] to the fewnomial bound (4.3), note that we may\nmultiply one of the polynomials by a monomial so that the two trinomials share a monomial.\nThen there are at most 5 = 2 + 2 + 1 distinct monomials occurring in the two trinomials.\nThe fewnomial bound for l = n = 2 is\n4\nX(2, 2) \u2264 2(2) * (2 + 1)4 = 5184 .\n\nWe remark that a trinomial system is not quite a general fewnomial system with l = n = 2.\nStill, the bound of five real solutions lent credence to the belief X(2, 2) is closer to five than\nto 5184 and that Khovanskii's fewnomial bound (4.3) could be improved.\nIn addition to providing the counterexample to Kushnirenko's conjecture, Sevostyanov\nalso established the first result of fewnomial-type. He showed the existence of an absolute\nbound \u03c3(d, m) for the number of real solutions to a system\nf (x, y) = g(x, y) = 0 ,\nwhere f is a polynomial of degree d and g has m terms. The proof of this result, like his\ncounterexample, has unfortunately been lost. This result however, was the inspiration for\nKhovanskii to develop his theory of fewnomials.\nRecently, Avenda\u00f1o [1], established a precise version of a special case of Sevostyanov's\ntheorem.\nTheorem 4.7 Suppose that f (x, y) is linear and g(x, y) has m terms. Then the system\nf (x, y) = g(x, y) = 0 ,\nhas at most 6m \u2212 4 real solutions.\n\n4.3\n\nSystems supported on a circuit\n\nRestricting the analysis of Section 3.2.1 to real solutions shows that X(0, n) = 1. Recently,\nit was shown that X(1, n) = 1+n. We discuss this here.\nA collection A of n+2 vectors in Zn which affinely spans Rn is called a circuit. The\ncircuit is primitive if its Z-affine span is all of Zn . When 0 \u2208 A, this means that Zn = ZA.\n45\n\n\fTheorem 4.8 (Bertrand, Bihan, and Sottile [9]) A polynomial system supported on a\nprimitive circuit has at most 2n + 1 nondegenerate nonzero real solutions.\nTheorem 4.9 (Bihan [11]) A polynomial system supported on a circuit has at most n+1\nnondegenerate positive solutions, and there exist systems supported on a circuit having n+1\npositive solutions.\nThis can be used to construct fewnomial systems with relatively many positive solutions.\nCorollary 4.10 (Bihan, Rojas, Sottile [12]) There exist systems of n polynomials in n\nvariables having l+n+1 monomials and at least \u2308 nl \u2309l positive solutions.\nThis gives a lower bound for X(l, n) of \u2308 nl \u2309l , and is the best construction when l is fixed\nand n is large. It remains an open problem to give constructions with more solutions, or\nconstructions with many solutions when l is not fixed.\nThe construction establishing Corollary 4.10 is quite simple. Suppose that n = kl is a\nmultiple of l, and let\nf1 (x1 , . . . , xk ) = f2 (x1 , . . . , xk ) = * * * = fk (x1 , . . . , xk ) = 0 ,\nbe a system with k+2 monomials and k+1 positive solutions. Such systems exist, by Theorem 4.9. Write F (x) = 0 for this system and assume that one of its monomials is a constant.\n(i)\n(i)\nFor each i = 1, . . . , l, let y (i) = (y1 , . . . , yk ) be a set of k variables. Then the system\nF (y (1) ) = F (y (2) ) = * * * = F (y (l) ) = 0 ,\nhas (k + 1)l solutions, kl variables, and 1 + l + kl monomials. When n = kl + r with r <;,\nadding extra variables yi and equations yi = 1 for i = 1, . . . , r gives a system with (\u230a nl \u230b + 1)l\npositive solutions and 1 + l + n monomials.\nWhen l = 1 the fewnomial bound (4.3) becomes\n2(\n\n1+n\n2\n\n) * (n + 1)1+n ,\n\nwhich is considerably larger than Bihan's bound of n+1. Replacing l+n by n in the fewnomial bound, it becomes equal to Bihan's bound when l = 1. When l = 0, this same\nsubstitution in (4.3) yields 1, which is the sharp bound when l = 0. In Chapter 5, we will\noutline generalizations of Theorems 4.8 and 4.9 to arbitrary l, giving the bound\nX(l, n) <\n\ne2 + 3 ( l ) l\n22 n\n4\n\n(4.13)\n\nfor positive solutions and, when A is primitive, a bound for all real solutions,\ne4 + 3 (2l ) l\n2 n .\n4\nThis is only slightly larger-the difference is in the exponents 2 and 4 of e. These are proven\nin [3, 13].\n46\n\n\fBy Corollary 4.10 and the bound (4.13),\nl n ml\ne2 + 3 (2l ) l\nl\u2212l nl <\n2 n .\n< X(n, l) <\nl\n4\nThis reveals the correct asymptotic information for X(n, l), when l is fixed, X(n, l) = \u0398(nl ).\nTheorems 4.8 and 4.9 are related, and we will outline their proofs, following the papers\nin which they appear, where more details may be found. To begin, let\nf1 (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) = f2 (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) = * * * = fn (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) = 0\n\n(4.14)\n\nbe a system with support a circuit A. Suppose that 0 \u2208 A and list the elements of the circuit\nA = {0, a0 , a1 , . . . , an }. After a multiplicative change of coordinates (if necessary), we may\nassume that a0 = len , where en is the nth standard basis vector. Since the system (4.14) is\ngeneric, row operations on the equations put it into diagonal form\nxai = wi + vi xln\n\nfor i = 1, . . . , n .\n\n(4.15)\n\nWhen A was a simplex we used integer linear algebra to reduce the equations to a very\nsimple system in Section 3.2.1. We use (different) integer linear algebra to simplify this\nsystem supported on a circuit.\n\n4.3.1\n\nSome arithmetic for circuits\n\nSuppose that {0, a0 , a1 , . . . , an } \u2282 Zn is a primitive circuit. We assume here that it is\nnondegenerate-there is no affine dependency involving a subset. (The bounds in the degenerate case are lower, replacing n by the size of this smaller circuit.) After possibly making\na coordinate change, we may assume that a0 = l * en , where en is the nth standard basis\nvector.\nFor each i, we may write ai = bi + ki * en , where bi \u2208 Zn\u22121 . Removing common factors\nfrom a nontrivial integer linear relation among the n vectors {b1 , . . . , bn } \u2282 Zn\u22121 gives us\nthe primitive relation among them (which is well-defined up to multiplication by \u22121),\np\nX\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03bbi bi =\n\ni=1\n\n\u03bbi bi .\n\ni=p+1\n\nHere, each \u03bbi > 0, and we assume that the vectors are ordered so that the relation has this\nform. We further assume that\np\nn\nX\nX\n\u03bbi k i > 0 .\nN :=\n\u03bbi k i \u2212\n\nThen we have\n\nNen +\n\ni=p+1\n\ni=1\n\np\nX\n\nn\nX\n\ni=1\n\nand so\nxN\nn\n\n\u03bbi ai \u2212\n\n\u03bbi ai = 0 ,\n\ni=p+1\n\np\nn\nY\nY\nai \u03bbi\n(xai )\u03bbi = 0 .\n* (x ) \u2212\ni=1\n\ni=p+1\n\n47\n\n(4.16)\n\n\f4.3.2\n\nElimination for circuits\n\nUsing (4.15) to substitute for xai in (4.16) gives the univariate consequence of (4.15)\nf (xn ) :=\n\nxN\nn\n\np\nY\ni=1\n\n(wi + vi xln )\u03bbi \u2212\n\nn\nY\n\n(wi + vi xln )\u03bbi .\n\n(4.17)\n\ni=p+1\n\nSome further arithmetic of circuits (which may be found in [9]) shows that f (xn ) has degree\nequal to n!vol(\u2206A ). This is in fact the eliminant of the system.\nLemma 4.11 The association of a solution x of (4.15) to its nth coordinate xn gives a\nbijection between the solutions of (4.15) and the roots of f (4.17) which restricts to a bijection\nbetween their real solutions/roots.\nWhile f is the eliminant of the system, we do not have a Gr\u00f6bner basis or even a\ntriangular system to witness this fact, and the proof proceeds by explicitly constructing a\nsolution (4.15) from a root xn of f .\nThe upper bound is found by writing f = F \u2212 G as in (4.17) and then perturbing f ,\nft (y) = t * F (y) \u2212 G(y) .\nWe simply estimate the number of changes in the the real roots of ft as t passes from \u2212\u221e to\n1, which can occur only at the singular roots of ft . While similar to the proof of Khovanskii's\ntheorem, this is not inductive, but relies on the form of the Wronskian F \u2032 G \u2212 G\u2032 F whose\nroots are the singular roots of ft . This may also be seen as an application of Rolle's Theorem.\nWe note that this estimation also uses Viro's construction for t near 0 and \u221e.\nThese estimates prove the bounds in Theorems 4.8 and 4.9. Sharpness comes from construction. In [9] Viro's method for univariate polynomials is used to construct polynomials f\nare constructed with 2n+1 real solutions, for special primitive circuits. Bihan [11] constructs\na system with n+1 positive solutions using Grothendieck's dessins d'enfants.\n\n4.3.3\n\nA family of systems with a sharp bound\n\nWe give a family of systems that illustrate the result of Theorem 4.8 (actually of an extension\nof it) and which may be treated by hand. These systems come from a family of polytopes\n\u2206 \u2282 Zn for which we prove a nontrivial upper bound on the number of real solutions to\npolynomial systems with primitive support A := \u2206 \u2229 Zn . That is, the integer points A in \u2206\naffinely span Zn , so that general systems supported on \u2206 have n!vol(\u2206) complex solutions,\nbut there are fewer than n!vol(\u2206) real solutions to polynomial systems with support A. This\nis intended to not only give a glimpse of the more general results in [9], but also possible\nextensions which are not treated in [13].\nLet l > k > 0 and n \u2265 3 be integers and \u01eb = (\u01eb1 , . . . , \u01ebn\u22121 ) \u2208 {0, 1}n\u22121 have at least one\nnonzero coordinate. The polytope \u2206\u01ebk,l \u2282 Rn is the convex hull of the points\n(0, . . . , 0), (1, 0, . . . , 0), . . . , (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0), (0, . . . , 0, k), (\u01eb1 , . . . , \u01ebn\u22121 , l) .\n48\n\n\fThe configuration A\u01ebk,l = \u2206\u01ebk,l \u2229 Zn also includes the points along the last axis\n(0, . . . , 0, 1), (0, . . . , 0, 2), . . . , (0, . . . , 0, k\u22121) .\nThese points P\ninclude the standard basis and the origin, so A\u01ebk,l is primitive in that ZA = Zn .\nSet |\u01eb| := i \u01ebi . Then the volume of \u2206\u01ebk,l is (l+k|\u01eb|)/n!. Indeed, the configuration A\u01ebk,l can\nbe triangulated into two simplices \u2206\u01ebk,l \\ {(\u01eb1 , . . . , \u01ebn\u22121 , l)} and \u2206\u01ebk,l \\ {0} with volumes k/n!\nand (l \u2212 k + k|\u01eb|)/n!, respectively. One way to see this is to apply the affine transformation\n(x1 , . . . , xn ) 7\u2212\u2192 (x1 , . . . , xn\u22121 , xn \u2212 k + k\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\nxi ) .\n\ni=1\n\nTheorem 4.12 The number, r, of real solutions to a generic system of n real polynomials\nwith support A\u01ebk,l lies in the interval\n0 \u2264 r \u2264 k + k|\u01eb| + 2 ,\nand every number in this interval with the same parity as l + k|\u01eb| occurs.\nThis upper bound does not depend on l and, since k < l, it is smaller than or equal to\nthe number l + k|\u01eb| of complex solutions. We use elimination to prove this result.\nExample 4.13 Suppose that n = k = 3, l = 5, and \u01eb = (1, 1).\nxyz 5\n\nThen the system\nx + y + xyz 5 + 1 + z + z 2 + z 3 = 0\nx + 2y + 3xyz 5 + 5 + 7z + 11z 2 + 13z 3 = 0\n2x + 2y + xyz 5 + 4 + 8z + 16z 2 + 32z 3 = 0\nis equivalent to\nx \u2212 (5 + 11z + 23z 2 + 41z 3 ) = 0\ny + (8 + 18z + 38z 2 + 72z 3 ) = 0\nxyz 5 \u2212 (2 + 6z + 14z 2 + 30z 3 ) = 0\n\nz3\nz2\n\n(1,1)\n\n\u22063,5\n\nz\n1\n\ny\nx\n\nAnd thus its number of real roots equals the number of real roots of\nz 5 (5 + 11z + 23z 2 + 41z 3 )(8 + 18z + 38z 2 + 72z 3 ) \u2212 (2 + 6z + 14z 2 + 30z 3 ) ,\nwhich, as we invite the reader to check, is 3.\nProof of Theorem 4.12. A generic real polynomial system with support A\u01ebk,l has the form\nn\u22121\nX\n\ncij xj + cin x\u01eb xln + fi (xn ) = 0\n\nj=1\n\n49\n\nfor i = 1, . . . , n ,\n\n\f\u01eb\n\nn\u22121\nwhere each polynomial fi has degree k and x\u01eb is the monomial x\u01eb11 * * * xn\u22121\n.\nSince all solutions to our system are simple, we may perturb the coefficient matrix\n(cij )ni,j=1 if necessary and then use Gaussian elimination to obtain an equivalent system\n\nx1 \u2212 g1 (xn ) = * * * = xn\u22121 \u2212 gn\u22121 (xn ) = x\u01eb xln \u2212 gn (xn ) = 0 ,\n\n(4.18)\n\nwhere each polynomial gi has degree k. Using the first n \u2212 1 polynomials to eliminate the\nvariables x1 , . . . , xn\u22121 gives the univariate polynomial\nxln * g1 (xn )\u01eb1 * * * gn\u22121 (xn )\u01ebn\u22121 \u2212 gn (xn ) ,\n\n(4.19)\n\nwhich has degree l + k|\u01eb| = v(\u2206\u01ebk,l ). Any zero of this polynomial leads to a solution of the\noriginal system (4.18) by back substitution. This implies that the number of real roots of\nthe polynomial (4.19) is equal to the number of real solutions to our original system (4.18).\nThe eliminant (4.19) has no terms of degree m for k < m < l, and so it has at most\nk + k|\u01eb| + 2 nonzero real roots, by Descartes's rule of signs. This proves the upper bound.\nWe omit the construction which shows that this bound is sharp.\n\n50\n\n\fChapter 5:\nFewnomial upper bounds from Gale\ndual polynomial systems\nThis needs a proper Introduction\nSuppose that we have the system of polynomials,\nv 2 w 3 \u2212 11uvw 3 \u2212 33uv 2 w + 4v 2 w + 15u2v + 7 = 0 ,\nv2w3\n+ 5uv 2 w \u2212 4v 2 w \u2212 3u2 v + 1 = 0 ,\nv 2 w 3 \u2212 11uvw 3 \u2212 31uv 2 w + 2v 2 w + 13u2v + 8 = 0 .\n\n(5.1)\n\nv 2 w 3 = 1 \u2212 u2 v \u2212 uv 2 w ,\nv 2 w = 21 \u2212 u2 v + uv 2 w ,\n10\nuvw 3 = 11\n(1 + u2 v \u2212 3uv 2 w) .\n\n(5.2)\n\nIf we solve them for the monomials v 2 w 3 , v 2 w, and uvw 3, we obtain\n\nSince\n\n\u00013\n\u0001\nuv 2 w * v 2 w 3 = u3 v 8 w 6 =\n\u00012\n\u00013\nu2 v * v 2 w 3\n= u4 v 8 w 9 =\n\n\u0001\n\u00013\n\u0001\nu2 v * v 2 w * uvw 3\nand\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n2\n2\nuv 2w * v 2 w * uvw 3 ,\n\nwe may substitute the expressions on the right hand sides of (5.2) for the monomials v 2 w 3 ,\nv 2 w, and uvw 3 in these expressions to obtain the system\n\u00013\n\u0001\n\u00013\n\u0001\n\u0001\n2\n2\n(1\n+\nu\nv\n\u2212\n3uv\nw)\nand\nuv 2 w * 1 \u2212 u2 v \u2212 uv 2w = u2 v * 12 \u2212 u2 v + uv 2 w * 10\n11\n\u0001 10\n\u00012\n\u00012\n\u00013\n\u00012 1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nu v * 1 \u2212 u v \u2212 uv w\n= uv w * 2 \u2212 u v + uv w * 11 (1 + u v \u2212 3uv w) .\nWriting x for u2 v and y for uv 2w and solving for 0, these become\n\u0001\n10\n(1 + x \u2212 3y) = 0 ,\nf :=\ny 3 (1 \u2212 x \u2212 y) \u2212 x( 21 \u2212 x + y)3 11\n\u00012\n10\n(1 + x \u2212 3y)\n= 0.\ng := x2 (1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)3 \u2212 y 2 ( 12 \u2212 x + y) 11\n\nand\n\n(5.3)\n\nFigure 5.1 shows the curves these define and the lines given by the linear factors in (5.3).\nIt is clear that the solutions to (5.3) in the complement of the lines are consequences of\nsolutions to (5.1). More, however, it true. The two systems define isomorphic schemes as\ncomplex or as real varieties, with the positive solutions to (5.1) corresponding to the solutions\nof (5.3) lying in the central pentagon. Gale duality, which generalizes this isomorphism, is\na first step towards the new fewnomial bounds of [3, 13].\nWe remark that these new bounds are derived using the general method that Khovanskii\ndeveloped in [65]. However, they take advantage of special geometry (encoded in Gale\nduality) available to systems of polynomials in a way that the proof of Khovanski's bound\n(Theorem 4.1) did not. Their main value is that they are sharp, in the asymptotic sense\ndescribed after Corollary 4.10.\n51\n\n\f\u001b\n\nf -\n\ng\nf\n\ng\n\n6\n\nf\n\n-\n\nf\nFigure 5.1: Curves and lines\n\n5.1\n\nGale duality for polynomial systems\n\nGale duality is an alternative way to view a sparse system of polynomials. It was developed\nin [14] in more generality than we will treat here. Let us work over the complex numbers.\nLet A = {0, a1 , . . . , al+n } \u2282 Zn be integer vectors which span Rn and suppose that we have\na system\nf1 (xn , . . . , xn ) = f2 (x1 , . . . , xn ) = * * * = fn (x1 , . . . , xn ) = 0\n(5.4)\nof polynomials with support A. As in Section 3.1.1, the solutions may be interpreted geometrically as \u03c6\u22121\nA (L), where \u03c6A is the map\n\u03c6A : Tn \u2212\u2192 Tl+n \u2282 Cl+n\n\nx 7\u2212\u2192 (xa1 , xa2 , . . . , xal+n ) ,\n\nand L \u2282 Cl+n is a codimension n plane defined by degree 1 polynomials \u039b1 , . . . , \u039bn corresponding to the polynomials fi . While we work here in Cn+l , but used PA = Pn+l in\nSection 3.1.1, there is no essential difference.\nSuppose that A is primitive in that ZA = Zn , so that the homomorphism \u03c6A is injective.\nThen the subscheme of Tn defined by (5.4) is isomorphic to the subscheme X := \u03c6(Tn ) \u2229 L\nof Tl+n or Cl+n . If we change our perspective and view X as the basic object, then the\nn\nparametrization \u03c6A of \u03c6A (Tn ) realizes X (or rather \u03c6\u22121\nA (X)) as the subscheme of T defined\nby (5.4).\nThe main idea behind Gale duality for polynomial systems is to instead parameterize L\nwith a map \u03c8p : Cl \u2192 L and then consider the subscheme \u03c8p\u22121 (X) of Cl , which is isomorphic\nto X. This is in fact what we did in transforming (5.1) into (5.3). We will show that \u03c8p\u22121 (X)\nis defined in Cl by a system of master functions, which we define in the next section.\n\n52\n\n\f5.1.1\n\nMaster functions\n\nLet pQ1 (y), . . . , pl+n (y) be pairwise non-proportional degree 1 polynomials on Cl . Their product i pi (y) = 0 defines a hyperplane arrangement H in Cl . Let \u03b2 \u2208 Zl+n be an integer\nvector, called a weight for the arrangement H. We use this to define a rational function p\u03b2 ,\np\u03b2 = p(y)\u03b2 := p1 (y)b1 p2 (y)b2 * * * pl+n (y)bl+n ,\n\nwhere \u03b2 = (b1 , . . . , bl+n ). This rational function p(y)\u03b2 is a master function for the arrangement H. As the components of \u03b2 may be negative, its natural domain of definition is the\ncomplement MH := Cl \\ H of the arrangement.\nA system of master functions in MH with weights B = {\u03b21 , . . . , \u03b2l } is the system of\nequations in MH ,\np(y)\u03b21 = p(y)\u03b22 = * * * = p(y)\u03b2l = 1 .\n(5.5)\nMore generally, we could instead consider equations of the form p(y)\u03b2 = \u03b1, where \u03b1 \u2208 T\nis an arbitrary nonzero complex number. We may however absorb such constants into the\npolynomials pi (y), as there are l+n such polynomials but only l constants in a system of\n10\nmaster functions. This may be viewed as the source of the factor 11\nin (5.3). We further\nassume that the system (5.5) defines a zero-dimensional scheme in MH . This implies that\nthe weights B are linearly independent, and that the suppressed constants multiplying the\npi (y) are sufficiently general.\nAs with sparse systems, a system of master functions may be realized geometrically\nthrough an appropriate map. The polynomials p1 (y), . . . , pl+n (y) define an affine map\n\u03c8p : Cl \u2212\u2192 Cl+n\n\ny 7\u2212\u2192 (p1 (y), p2(y), . . . , pl+n (y)) .\n\nThis map is injective if and only if the polynomials {1, p1(y), . . . , pl+n (y)} span the space of\ndegree 1 polynomials on Cl , in which case the hyperplane arrangement H is called essential.\nThe hyperplane arrangement H is the pullback along \u03c8p of the coordinate hyperplanes zi = 0\nin Cl+n , and its complement MH is the pullback of the torus Tl+n which is the complement\nof the coordinate hyperplanes in Cl+n .\nThe weights B are saturated if they are linearly independent and span a saturated subgroup of Zl+m , that is, if ZB = QB \u2229 Zl+n . Linear independence of B is equivalent to the\nsubgroup G of the torus Tl+n defined by the equations\nz \u03b21 = z \u03b22 = * * * = z \u03b2l = 1\n\n(5.6)\n\nhaving dimension n and saturation is equivalent to G being connected. (Here, z1 , . . . , zl+n\nare the coordinates for Cl+n .) In this way, we see that the equations (5.5) describe the\npullback \u03c8p\u22121 (G) of this subgroup G. We summarize this discussion.\nProposition 5.1 A system of master functions (5.5) in MH is the pullback along \u03c8p of the\nintersection of the linear space \u03c8p (Cl ) with a subgroup G of Tl+n of dimension n, and any\nsuch pullback defines a system of master functions in MH . When \u03c8p is injective, it gives a\nscheme-theoretic isomorphism between the solutions of the system of master functions and\nthe intersection G \u2229 \u03c8p (Cl ).\n53\n\n\f5.1.2\n\nGale duality\n\nProposition 5.1 is the new ingredient needed for the notion of Gale duality. Suppose that\nG \u2282 Tl+n is a connected subgroup of dimension n and that L \u2282 Cl+n is a linear subspace\nof dimension l not parallel to any coordinate hyperplane. Then the intersection G \u2229 L has\ndimension 0.\nDefinition 5.2 Suppose that we are given\n1. An isomorphism \u03c6A : Tn \u2192 G for A = {0, a1 , . . . , al+n } and equations (5.6) defining G\nas a subgroup of Tl+n . Necessarily A is primitive and B = {\u03b21 , . . . , \u03b2l } is saturated.\n2. A linear isomorphism \u03c8p : Cl \u2192 L and degree 1 polynomials \u039b1 , . . . , \u039bn on Cl+n defining L.\nLet H \u2282 Cl be the pullback of the coordinate hyperplanes of Cl+n along \u03c8p . We say that\nthe system of sparse polynomials on Tn\n\u03c6\u2217 (\u039b1 ) = \u03c6\u2217 (\u039b2 ) = * * * = \u03c6\u2217 (\u039bn ) = 0\n\n(5.7)\n\nwith support A is Gale dual to the system of master functions\np(y)\u03b21 = p(y)\u03b22 = * * * = p(y)\u03b2l = 1\n\n(5.8)\n\nwith weights B on the hyperplane complement MH and vice-versa.\nThe following is immediate.\nTheorem 5.3 A pair of Gale dual systems (5.7) and (5.8) define isomorphic schemes.\nThis notion of Gale duality involves two different linear algebraic dualities in the sense\nof linear functions annihilating vector spaces. In the first, the degree 1 polynomials pi (y)\ndefining the map \u03c8p are annihilated by the degree 1 polynomials \u039bi which define the system\nof sparse polynomials (5.7). The second is integral, as the weights B form a basis for the\nfree abelian group of integer linear relations among the nonzero elements of A. Writing\nthe elements of B as the rows of a matrix, the l+n columns form the Gale dual or Gale\ntransform [47, \u00a75.4] of the vector configuration A-this is the source of our terminology.\nIf we restrict the domain of \u03c6A to the real numbers or to the positive reals, then we\nobtain the two forms of Gale duality which are relevant to us. Set TR := R \\ {0}, the\nreal torus and R> to be the positive real numbers. Suppose that A is not necessarily\nprimitive, but that the lattice index [Zn : ZA] is odd. Then \u03c6A : TnR \u2192 Tl+n\nis injective.\nR\nSimilarly, if ZB has odd index in its saturation QB \u2229 Zl+n , which is the group of integer\nlinear relations holding on A, then the equations (5.6) define a not necessarily connected\nsubgroup G \u2282 Tl+n whose real points GR lie in its connected component containing the\nidentity. When the linear polynomials \u039bi of (5.7) and pi of (5.8) are real and annihilate\neach other, then these two systems-which do not necessarily define isomorphic schemes in\n54\n\n\fTn and MH -define isomorphic real analytic sets in TnR for (5.7) and in the complement\nR\nMH\n:= Rl \\ HR of the real hyperplanes defined by the pi for (5.8).\nIn the version valid for the positive real numbers, we may suppose that the exponents\nA are real vectors, for if r \u2208 R> and a \u2208 R, then r a := exp(a log(x)) is well-defined. In\nthis case, the weights B should be a basis for the vector space of linear relations holding\non A, and the degree 1 polynomials \u039bi and pi are again real and dual to each other. The\nequations 5.6 for z \u2208 Rl+n\ndefine a connected subgroup of Rl+n\nwhich equals \u03c6A (Rn> ). In\n>\n>\nthis generality, the polynomial system (5.7) makes sense only for x \u2208 Rn> and the system of\nmaster functions (5.8) only makes sense for y in the positive chamber \u2206p of the hyperplane\nR\ncomplement MH\n,\n\u2206p := {y \u2208 Rl | pi (y) > 0 i = 1, . . . , l+n} ,\n\nand the two systems define isomorphic real analytic sets in Rn> for (5.7) and in \u2206p for (5.8).\n\n5.1.3\n\nAlgebra of Gale duality\n\nThe description of Gale duality in Definition 5.2 lends itself immediately to an algorithm\nfor converting a system of sparse polynomials into an equivalent system of master functions.\nWe describe this over C, but it works equally well over R or over R> . Suppose that A \u2282 Zn\nis a primitive collection of integer vectors and suppose that\nf1 (x1 , . . . , xn ) = f2 (x1 , . . . , xn ) = * * * = fn (x1 , . . . , xn ) = 0\n\n(5.9)\n\ndefines a zero dimensional subscheme of Tn . In particular, the polynomials fi are linearly\nindependent. We may solve these equations for some of the monomials to obtain\nxa1 = g1 (x) =: p1 (xan+1 , . . . , xal+m+n )\n..\n..\n.\n.\nan\n\nx\n\nan+1\n\n= gn (x) =: pn (x\n\nal+m+n\n\n,...,x\n\n(5.10)\n\n)\n\nHere, for each i = 1, . . . , n, gi (x) is a polynomial with support {0, an+1 , . . . , al+n } which\nis a degree 1 polynomial function pi (xan+1 , . . . , xal+n ) in the given l arguments. For i =\nn+1, . . . , l+n, set pi (xan+1 , . . . , xal+n ) := xai .\nAn integer linear relation among the exponent vectors in A,\nb1 a1 + b2 a2 + * * * + bl+n al+n = 0 ,\nis equivalent to the monomial identity\n(xa1 )b1 * (xa2 )b2 * * * (xal+n )bl+n = 1 ,\nwhich gives the consequence of the system (5.10)\n\u0001b1\n\u0001b\np1 (xan+1 , . . . , xal+n )\n* * * pl+n (xan+1 , . . . , xal+n ) l+n = 1 .\n\nDefine y1 , . . . , yl to be new variables which are coordinates for Cl . The degree 1 polynomials pi (y1 , . . . , yl ) define a hyperplane arrangement H in Cl . Let B := {\u03b21 , . . . , \u03b2l } \u2282 Zl+n\n55\n\n\fbe a basis for the Z-module of integer linear relations among the nonzero vectors in A. These\nweights B define a system of master functions\np(y)\u03b21 = p(y)\u03b22 = * * * = p(y)\u03b2l = 1\n\n(5.11)\n\nin the complement MH of the arrangement.\nTheorem 5.4 The system of polynomials (5.9) in Tn and the system of master functions (5.11) in MH define isomorphic schemes.\nProof. Condition (1) in Definition 5.2 holds as A and B are both primitive and annihilate\neach other. The linear forms \u039bi that pull back along \u03c6A to define the system (5.10) are\n\u039bi (z) = zi \u2212 pi (zn+1 , . . . , zl+n ) ,\nwhich shows that condition (2) holds, and so the statement follows from Theorem 5.3.\nThe example at the beginning of this chapter illustrated Gale duality, but the equations (5.3) are not of the form p\u03b2 = 1. They are, however, easily transformed into such\nequations, and we obtain\ny 3 (1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)\nx2 (1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)3\n\u0001\n=\n\u00012 = 1 .\n10\n10\nx( 21 \u2212 x + y)3 11\n(1 + x \u2212 3y)\ny 2( 12 \u2212 x + y) 11\n(1 + x \u2212 3y)\n\n(5.12)\n\nSystems of the form (5.3) may be obtained from systems of master functions by multiplying\np\u03b2 = 1 by the terms of p\u03b2 with negative exponents to clear the denominators, to obtain\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\np\u03b2 = p\u03b2 and thus p\u03b2 \u2212 p\u03b2 = 0, where \u03b2\u00b1 is the componentwise maximum of the vectors\n(0, \u00b1\u03b2).\n\n5.2\n\nNew fewnomial bounds\n\nThe transformation of Gale duality is the key step in establishing the new fewnomial bounds.\nTheorem 5.5 A system (5.4) of n polynomials in n variables having a total of l+n+1\nmonomials with exponents A \u2282 Rn has at most\ne2 + 3 (2l ) l\n2 n\n4\npositive nondegenerate solutions.\nIf A \u2282 Zn and ZA has odd index in Zn , then the system has at most\ne4 + 3 ( l ) l\n22 n\n4\nnondegenerate real solutions.\n\n56\n\n\fThe first bound is proven in [13] and the second in [3]. By Gale duality, Theorem 5.5 is\nequivalent to the nest Theorem.\nTheorem 5.6 Let p1 (y), . . . , pl+n (y) be degree 1 polynomials on Rl that, with 1, span the\nspace of degree 1 polynomials. For any linearly independent vectors B = {\u03b21 , . . . , \u03b2l } \u2282 Rl+n ,\nthe number of solutions to\n1 = p(y)\u03b2j\n\nfor j = 1, . . . , l\n\nin the positive chamber \u2206p is less than\ne2 + 3 (2l ) l\n2 n .\n4\nR\nIf B \u2282 Zl+n and has odd index in its saturation, then the number of solutions in MH\nis less\nthan\ne4 + 3 (2l ) l\n2 n .\n4\n\nShould replace the hypotheses on the degree 1 polynomials by the notion of essential hyperplane arrangement, and have that arise in the discussion of Gale duality.\nWe outline the proof of Theorem 5.6 in the next three sections.\n\n5.2.1\n\nOne idea\n\nThe basic idea behind the proof of Theorem 5.6 is to use the Khovanskii-Rolle Theorem,\nbut in a slightly different form than given in Theorem 4.3. Using it in this way to establish\nbounds for real solutions to equations was first done in [43]. Given functions g1 , . . . , gm\ndefined on a domain D, let V (g1 , . . . , gm ) be their set of common zeroes. If C is a curve in\nD, let ubc(C) be its number of unbounded components in D.\nTheorem 5.7 (Khovanskii-Rolle) Let g1 , . . . , gl be smooth functions defined on a domain\nD \u2282 Rl with finitely many common zeroes and suppose that C := V (g1 , . . . , gl\u22121 ) is a smooth\ncurve. Set J to be the Jacobian determinant, det(\u2202gi /\u2202yj ), of g1 , . . . , gl . Then we have\n|V (g1 , . . . , gl )| \u2264 ubc(C) + |V (g1 , . . . , gl\u22121 , J)| .\n\n(5.13)\n\nThis form of the Khovanskii-Rolle Theorem follows from the from the usual Rolle Theorem. Suppose that gl (a) = gl (b) = 0, for points a, b on the same component of C. Let s(t)\nbe the arclength along this component of C, measured from a point t0 \u2208 C, and consider\nthe map,\nC \u2212\u2192 R2\nt 7\u2212\u2192 (s(t), gl (t)) .\nThis is the graph of a differentiable function g(s) which vanishes when s = s(a) and s = s(b),\nso there is a point s(b) between s(a) and s(b) where its derivative aso vanishes, by the usual\n57\n\n\fRolle Theorem. But then c lies between a and b on that component of C, and the vanishing\nof g \u2032 (s(c)) is equivalent to the Jacobian determinant J vanishing at c.\nThus along any arc of C connecting two zeroes of gl , the Jacobian vanishes at least once.\n\u0010 V\u2206 (g1 , . . . , gl\u22121 , J)\n\u0010\u0010\n)\n\ngl = 0\n\nC = V\u2206 (g1 , . . . , gl\u22121 )\nAs in the proof of Theorem 4.3, the estimate of (5.13) follows from the observation\nconcerning consecutive zeroes of gl along C.\n\n5.2.2\n\nA generalization and two reductions\n\nWe first make an adjustment to the system of master functions in Theorem 5.6, replacing\neach master function p(y)\u03b2 = p1 (y)b1 * * * pl+n (y)bl+n by\n|p(y)|\u03b2 := |p1 (y)|b1 * * * |pl+n (y)|bl+n .\nFor example, if we take absolute values in the system of master functions (5.12), we obtain\n|y|3|1 \u2212 x \u2212 y|\n|x|2 |1 \u2212 x \u2212 y|3\n= 1.\n=\n|x|| 21 \u2212 x + y|3 | 10\n(1 + x \u2212 3y)|\n|y|2| 12 \u2212 x + y|| 10\n(1 + x \u2212 3y)|2\n11\n11\n\n(5.14)\n\nThis new system with absolute values will still have the same number of solutions in the\npositive chamber \u2206p as the original system, since |pi (y)| = pi (y) for i = 1, . . . , l+n and\nR\ny \u2208 \u2206p . Its solutions in the hyperplane complement MH\nwill include the solutions to the\nsystem of master functions from Theorem 5.6, but there may be more solutions.\nWe illustrate this for the system (5.14) in Figure 5.2, which we may compare to Figure 5.1\nas the system of master functions (5.12) is equivalent to the system (5.3) in the complement\nof the lines. In particular, among the solutions to the system (5.14) are the three solutions\nto (5.3) in the positive chamber (which is shaded) as well as the three solutions to (5.3)\noutside the positive chamber. The system (5.14) has four additional solutions outside the\npositive chamber, which are marked in Figure 5.2.\nWe give a proof of Theorem 5.6 for systems of the form |p(y)|\u03b2j = 1 for j = 1, . . . , l. This\nwill imply the bound for systems of master functions. Taking absolute values allows nonintegral (real number) exponents in |p(y)|\u03b2j = 1, and so we need not require that exponents\nare integral.\nWe promised two reductions.\n58\n\n\fFigure 5.2: Curves from absolute values\n1. The degree 1 polynomials pi (y) are in general position in that the hyperplanes in the\narrangement H are in linear general position. That is, any j of them meet in an affine\nlinear subspace of codimension j, if j \u2264 l, and their intersection is empty if j > l. We\nmay do this, as we are bounding nondegenerate solutions, which cannot be destroyed\nif the pi (y) are perturbed to put the hyperplanes into this general position.\n2. Let B be the matrix whose rows are \u03b21 , . . . , \u03b2l . We may assume that every minor\nof B is non-zero. This may be done by perturbing the real-number exponents in the\nfunctions |p(y)|\u03b2j . This will not reduce the number of nondegenerate solutions.\n\nPerturbing exponents is not as drastic of a measure as it first seems. Note that in\nthe hyperplane complement, |p(y)|\u03b2 = 1 defines the same set as log(|p(y)|\u03b2 ) = 0. If\n\u03b2 = (b1 , . . . , bl+n ), then this is simply\nb1 log |p1 (y)| + b2 log |p2 (y)| + * * * + bl+n log |pl+n (y)| = 0 .\n\n(5.15)\n\nExpressing the equations in this form shows that we may perturb the exponents.\nWe first look at these reductions in the context of the system of master functions (5.12).\nThe hyperplane arrangement H is an arrangement of lines in which no three meet and no\ntwo are parallel, and thus they are in general position. The matrix of exponents is\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2 \u22122\n3 \u22121 \u22122\nB =\n.\n1 \u22123 \u22121\n3\n1\nNo entry and no minor of B vanishes.\nLet us now see how the Khovanskii-Rolle Theorem applies to the system (5.14) of Figure 5.2, restricted to the positive chamber. First, take logarithms and rearrange to obtain\n10\n(1+x\u22123y)| = 0\n2 log |x| \u2212 2 log |y| + 3 log |1\u2212x\u2212y| \u2212 log | 12 \u2212x+y| \u2212 2 log | 11\n1\n10\nlog |x| \u2212 3 log |y| + 1 log |1\u2212x\u2212y| + 3 log | 2 \u2212x+y| + log | 11 (1+x\u22123y)| = 0\n\n59\n\n\fCall these functions f1 and f2 , respectively. Their Jacobian is the rational function\n2x3 \u2212 16x2 y + 12xy 2 + 6y 3 \u2212 31\nx2 + 26xy \u2212 53\ny 2 + 29 x +\n2\n2\nxy(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)( 21 \u2212x+y)(1 + x \u2212 3y)\n\n15\ny\n2\n\n\u22122\n\nwhose denominator is the product of the linear factors defining the lines in Figure 5.2.\nClearing the denominator and multiplying by 2, we obtain a cubic polynomial\nJ2 := 4x3 \u2212 32x2 y + 24y 2x + 12y 3 \u2212 31x2 + 52xy \u2212 53y 2 + 9x + 15y \u2212 4 .\nIts zero set meets the curve C1 (which is defined by f1 = 0) in 6 points, five of which we\ndisplay in Figure 5.3-the sixth is at (3.69, \u22120.77).

By our assumptions that\nthe polynomials gi and the exponents \u03b2j are general, this will be a smooth curve in the\nR\nhyperplane complement MH\n.\nWe now iterate the Khovanskii-Rolle Theorem 5.7 to estimate the number of solutions\nto a system of master functions as in Theorem 5.6.\n|V (g1 , g2 , . . . , gl )| \u2264 ubc(Cl ) + |V (g1 , g2 , . . . , gl\u22121 , Jl )|\n\u2264 ubc(Cl ) + ubc(Cl\u22121 ) + |V (g1 , . . . , gl\u22122 , Jl\u22121 , Jl )|\n\u2264 ubc(Cl ) + * * * + ubc(C1 ) + |V (J1 , J2 , . . . , Jl )| .\n\n(5.16)\n\nR\nHere, V (* * * ) is the common zeroes in the hyperplane complement MH\n.

For the second,\nnore that Cj = \u03bcj\u22121 \u2229 V (Jj+1 , . . . , Jl ). Since each unbounded component has two ends,\nwe estimate the number of unbounded components by 12 of the number of points in the\nboundary of \u2206 that are limits of points of Cj . By Lemma 5.8, these will be points in the\ncodimension skeleta where Jj+1 , . . . , Jl vanish. The bound in the second statement of 5.10\n\u0001\n(l\u2212j\n2 ) nl\u2212j .

We get the bound in (3) by\nnoting that in the neighborhood of any codimension j stratum of H, the complement has at\nR\nmost 2j chambers, and so each point of Cj at the boundary of MH\ncan contribute at most\nj\n2 such ends.\nR\nThe complement MH\nof the hyperplane arrangement consists of many chambers. The\nfirst bound of Theorem 5.6 is in fact a bound for the number of solutions in any chamber,\nwhile the second bound is for the number of solutions in all chambers. This is smaller than\nwhat one may naively expect.

This is the source for the mild difference between\nthe two estimates in Theorem 5.5.\nWe may combine the estimates of Lemma 5.10 with (5.16) to estimate |V\u2206 (J1 , . . . , Jl )|\nand |V (J1 , . . . , Jl )|,\nl\n\n1X\n|V\u2206 (J1 , . . . , Jl )| \u2264\n2 j=1\n\n1+l+n\nj\n\n\u0001\n\nl\u2212j\nl\n* 2( 2 ) nl\u2212j + 2(2) nl ,\n\n1+l+n\nj\n\n\u0001\n\nl\u2212j\nl\n* 2( 2 ) nl\u2212j * 2j + 2(2) nl .\n\nl\n\n1X\n2 j=1\n\n|V (J1 , . . . , Jl )| \u2264\n\nand\n\nIt is not hard to show the estimate [13, Eq.(3.4)]\n1+l+n\nj\n\n\u0001\n\nl\u2212j\n2j\u22121 ( l ) l\n* 2( 2 ) nl\u2212j \u2264\n22 n ,\nj!\n\nso that these estimates become\n\u0010 P\n\u0011 l\nl\n1\n2j\u22121\n|V\u2206 (J1 , . . . , Jl )| \u2264\n+\n1\n2(2) nl \u2264\nj!\n\u0011 l\n\u0010 2 Pj=1 2j\u22121\nl\n2\n1\n+ 1 2(2) nl \u2264\n|V (J1 , . . . , Jl )| \u2264\nj=1 j!\n2\n\ne2 +3 (2) l\n2 n\n4\nl\n\ne4 +3 (\n2\n4\n\nl\n2\n\n,\n\n) nl .\n\nThis implies Theorem 5.6 and thus the new fewnomial bounds, Theorem 5.5.\n62\n\nand\n\n\fChapter 6:\nLower Bounds for Sparse Polynomial\nSystems\nIn Chapter 1, we mentioned how work of Welschinger [131], Mikhalkin [79], and of Kharlamov, Itenberg, and Shustin [56, 57] combined to show that there is a nontrivial lower bound\nWd for the number of real rational curves of degree d interpolating 3d\u22121 points in RP2 .

Similar results were found by Solomon [103] for rational curves on real\nCalabi-Yau threefolds. For example, there are at least 15 real lines on a smooth quintic\nhyperurface in P4 .\nEremenko and Gabrielov [33] have a similar result for the number of real solutions to\nthe inverse Wronski problem. They gave numbers \u03c3m,p > 0 for 0 < m \u2264 p with m+p odd,\nand proved that if \u03a6 is a real polynomial of degree mp then there are at least \u03c3m,p different\nm-dimensional subspaces of the form Span{f1 , f2 , . . . , fm } where each fi is a real polynomial\nof degree m+p\u22121, and their Wronskian Wr (f1 , f2 , . . . , fm ) is a scalar multiple of \u03a6. We will\ndiscuss this in Section 6.5.\nWhile these results are spectacular, they are but the beginning of what we believe will\nbe a bigger and more important story (at least for the applications of mathematics). These\nare examples of natural geometric problems possessing a lower bound on their numbers\nof real solutions. It would be a very important development for some applications if this\nphenomenon were widespread, if there were methods to detect when such lower bounds\nexisted, and if there were also methods to compute or estimate these lower bounds. The\npoint is that nontrivial lower bounds imply the existence of real solutions to systems of\nequations, or to interesting geometric problems. A beginning of the interaction between\napplications and this new theory of lower bounds is found in work of Fiedler-Le Touz\u00e9 [36]\nand discussed in Section 1.3 of Chapter 1.\nThis chapter will report on the first steps toward a theory of lower bounds for sparse\npolynomial systems as given in [105]. There are three papers where one may read more\nabout this subject.\n[33] A. Eremenko and A.

It remains an important open problem to develop a theory for\nunmixed systems such as those which appear in Bernstein's Theorem.\u2020 Example 6.7 at the\nend of this chapter is a first step in this direction.\n\n6.1\n\nPolynomial systems from posets\n\nLet P be a finite partially ordered set (poset), whose elements we take to be our variables.\nFor convenience, assume that P has n elements. The order ideals I \u2282 P are its up sets-\nsubsets that are closed upwards. Specifically, a subset I \u2282 P is an order ideal if whenever\nx < y in P with x \u2208 I, then we must have y \u2208 I. Our polynomials will have monomials\nindexed by these order ideals. For I \u2282 P set\nY\nxI :=\nx.\nx\u2208I\n\nA linear extension w of P is a permutation w : x1 , x2 , . . . , xn of the elements of P such that\nxi < xj in P implies that i < j. Let \u03bb(P ) denote the number of linear extensions of a poset\nP . The sign-imbalance \u03c3(P ) of P is\n\u03c3(P ) :=\n\nX\n\nsgn(w) ,\n\n(6.1)\n\nthe sum over all linear extensions w of P . Here, sgn(w) is the sign of the permutation w. (To\nbe precise, this makes sense only if we first fix one linear extension \u03c0 of P and measure the\nsign of w\u03c0 \u22121. Taking the absolute value in (6.1) removes the effect of that choice.) Lastly,\na Wronski polynomial for P is a polynomial of the form\nX\nc|I| xI ,\n(6.2)\nI\n\n\u2020\n\nPut a statement like this in the chapter on Gale duality!\n\n64\n\n\fthe sum over all order ideals I of P , where c0 , c1 , . . . , cn \u2208 R. Note that the coefficient of the\nmonomial xI depends only upon its degree, |I|. The reason for the term Wronski polynomial\nis that this comes from a linear projection with a special form that is also shared by the\nWronski map. (This is discussed just before Section 8.2.1 in Chapter 8.)\nTheorem 6.1 Suppose that P is a finite poset in which every maximal chain has the same\nparity. Then a generic system of Wronski polynomials for P has \u03bb(P ) complex solutions, at\nleast \u03c3(P ) of which will be real.\nRemark 6.2 A variant of this is to first fix real numbers \u03b1I for each order ideal I and then\nconsider polynomials of the form\nX\nc|I| \u03b1I xI .\n(6.3)\nI\n\nThat is, the coefficients c0 , c1 , . . . , cn vary in Rn , but the numbers \u03b1I are fixed. The same\nstatement holds about such systems. In fact, this variant is closest to the Wronski map in\nSchubert calculus.\nExample 6.3 Let P be the incomparable union of two chains, each of length 2,\nx\n\nz\n\nP :=\n\n.\nw\n\ny\n\nHere are the monomials corresponding to the order ideals of P .\n{\u2205, x, z, wx, xz, yz, xyz, wxz, wxyz} .\nA Wronski polynomial for P has the form\nc4 wxyz\n+ c3 (xyz + wxz)\n+ c2 (wx + xz + yz)\n+ c1 (x + z)\n+ c0 ,\n\n(6.4)\n\nwhere the coefficients c0 , . . . , c4 are real numbers.\nThere are six linear extensions of P , as each is a permutation of the word wxyz where\nw precedes x and y precedes z. The sign-imbalance of P is seen to be 2, as computed in the\nfollowing table.\npermutation\nsign\n\nwxyz\n+\n\nwyxz\n\u2212\n\nywxz\n+\n\nwyzx ywzx yzwx\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\n\u03c3(P )\n2\n\nSince P has two maximal chains and each contains 2 elements, it satisfies the hypotheses\nof Theorem 6.1, and so we conclude that:\n65\n\n\fA system of four equations involving polynomials of the\nform (6.4) has six solutions, at least two of which are real.\nThe rest of this chapter will discuss the steps in the proof of Theorem 6.1, the more\ngeneral results contained in [105], and some examples that illustrate this phenomenon of\ngaps.\n\n6.2\n\nOrientability of real toric varieties\n\nRecall from Chapter 3 that a sparse polynomial system with support A \u2282 Zn is equivalent\nto a linear section XA \u2229 L of the toric variety XA . In fact, its solutions are\n\u03c6\u22121\nA (XA \u2229 L) ,\nwhere \u03c6A : Tn \u220b x 7\u2192 [xa | a \u2208 A] \u2208 PA is the parametrization map and XA is the closure of\nits image.\nIssue 1. In order for there to be a bijective correspondence between real solutions of the\noriginal system and real points in the linear section, we need that the map \u03c6A be injective\non (R\u00d7 )n , which is the condition that the index [ZA : Zn ] be odd. This should be regarded\nas a minor issue and a mild assumption. We have already seen this in Chapters 3 and 5.\nThe key idea at the beginning of this theory is to realize the intersection XA \u2229 L as the\nfiber of a map. To that end, let E \u2282 L be a hyperplane in L that does not meet XA and\nM \u2243 Pn a linear space that is disjoint from E. Then E has codimension n+1 and the set of\ncodimension n planes containing E is naturally identified with M \u2243 Pn , as each codimension\nn plane containing E meets M in a unique point. Define the linear projection\n\u03c0 = \u03c0E : PA \u2212 E \u2212\u2192 M \u2243 Pn\n\n(6.5)\n\nby sending a point p \u2208 PA \u2212 E to the intersection of M with span of E and p. Figure 6.1\nillustrates this in P3 , where E and M are lines. We sometimes write \u03c0 : PA \u2212 \u2192 Pn , using\nthe broken arrow \u2212 \u2192 to indicate that the map is not defined on all of PA .\nWrite \u03c0 for the restriction of the linear projection to the toric variety XA . If y := L \u2229 M\nis the point where L meets M, then\nXA \u2229 L = \u03c0 \u22121 (y) .\nThis is also illustrated in Figure 6.1, where XA is a cubic curve. The reason that we\nreformulate our system of polynomials as the fiber of a map is so that we may use topological\nmethods to study its solutions.\nThat is, we work over R, define YA := XA \u2229 RPA , and consider the real linear section\nYA \u2229 LR . Equivalently, we restrict the projection \u03c0 further to a map\nf : YA \u2192 RPn ,\nand consider points in the fiber f \u22121 (p), where p \u2208 RPn . Since YA and RPn have the\nsame dimension, the map f may have a topological degree. For this, YA and RPn must be\n66\n\n\f\u03c0\n\n-\n\nL\n\u0003\n\u0003\u000f\n\nEH\n\nj\nH\n\nMB\n\nB\nB\n\nB\n\n6 \u0001\n\u0001\nB \u0001\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\u0015\u0001\n\n\u001b\n\nM\n\n\u001b\n\ny\n\nXA\n\n\u03c0 \u22121 (y)\n\nFigure 6.1: A linear projection \u03c0 with center E.\norientible and we must fix orientations of YA and of RPn . Then, for every regular regular\nvalue y \u2208 RPn of f , the differential map df is a bijection on the tangent spaces of every\npoint x \u2208 f \u22121 (y). Define sign(x) := 1 if the differential preserves the orientations at x and\ny and sign(x) := \u22121 if the orientations are reversed. The topological degree of f is the sum\nX\nsign(x) .\nx\u2208f \u22121 (y)\n\nThis definition does not depend upon the choice of a regular value y, as RPn is connected.\u2020\nThe value of the notion of topological degree is the following.\u00a7\nTheorem 6.4 The number of points in a fiber f \u22121 (y), for y \u2208 RPn a regular value of f , is\nat least the absolute value of the topological degree of f .\nSince both RPn and YA are not always orientable, the topological degree of f is not\nalways defined, and so we do not get a bound as in Theorem 6.4. To remedy this, we\nconsider also the lift of the linear projection \u03c0 to the double covers coming from spheres:\n\u03c0+\n\nf + : YA+ \u2282 S A \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2192 S n\n?\n\n?\n\n\u03c0\n\n?\n\n(6.6)\n\nf : YA \u2282 RPA \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2192 RPn\nThen the topological degree of the map f + provides a lower bound for the number of\nsolutions, as in Theorem 6.4. We seek criteria which imply that the map f or its lift\nf + to the double covers has a well-defined degree. That is, either YA or YA+ is orientable.\nFor this, we use Cox's construction of XA as a quotient of a torus acting on affine space,\nas detailed in [21, Theorem 2.1]. (In the symplectic category, this is due to Delzant.) The\n\u2020\n\u00a7\n\nGive a reference for this.\nReconcile this with the use of degree in Chapter 2.\n\n67\n\n\fconvex hull of A is the polytope \u2206 := \u2206A . We need the dual description of \u2206 in terms of\nintersections of half-spaces, or facet inequalities, which have the form\n\u2206 = {z \u2208 Rn | B * z \u2265 \u2212b} ,\nwhere B is an integer N by n matrix (N is the number of facets of \u2206) whose rows are the\ninward-pointing normals to the facets of \u2206, and b \u2208 ZN measures the (signed) lattice distance\nof each facet from the origin. Then there is a natural parametrization \u03c8\u2206 : CN \u2212 Z\u2206 \u0589 XA ,\nrealizing XA as a geometric invariant theory quotient of CN by a subtorus of TN . (We do\nnot give the details here, see [21] or [105].)\nIssue 2. While \u03c8\u2206 restricts to a map \u03c8\u2206 : RN \u2212 Z\u2206 \u2192 YA (and also to Y\u2206+ ), these maps are\nnot necessarily surjective. This map \u03c8\u2206 is surjective if and only if the column span col(B)\nof the matrix B has odd index in its saturation, ZN \u2229 (Q \u2297Z col(B)).\n\nWhen the standard orientation of RN drops to an orientation either of YA or of YA+ under\nthe Cox quotient map \u03c8\u2206 , we say that YA is Cox-orientable.\n\nTheorem 6.5 With the assumptions outlined in Issue 1 and Issue 2, if col(B)+Z*b contains\na vector, all of whose coordinates are odd, then YA is Cox-orientable. If col(B) has such a\nvector, then YA receives the orientation, otherwise YA+ receives the orientatation.\nRemarks.\n1. Given a projection map \u03c0 (6.5) whose center E is disjoint from YA , write f for its\nrestriction to YA . Suppose that YA is Cox-orientable. Then lift f + : YA+ \u2192 S n of f to\nYA+ has a well-defined degree, which is a lower bound for the number of real solutions\nto polynomial systems arising as fibers of the map f . Call this number the real degree\nof the map f .\n2. If P is a poset and A \u2282 {0, 1}P consists of the indicator functions of its order ideals,\nso that a Wronski polynomial for P (6.2) has support A, then it is not hard to show\nthat ZA = Zn and also YA is Cox-orientable if all maximal chains of P have the same\nparity.\nThis parity condition is sufficient, but not necessary, for the Wronski polynomial system on YA to have a lower bound. The poset\nP=\n\n,\n\nhas two maximal chains of lengths 3 and 4, and so it\u0001is not necessarily Cox-oriented.\n\u0001\nNevertheless, its Wronski polynomial systems have 73 = 35 solutions, at least 31 = 3\nof which are real. See Section 6.4\n\n68\n\n\f6.3\n\nDegree from foldable triangulations\n\nThese results provide us with a challenge: compute the real degree of a (or any) map f\narising as a linear projection of a Cox-orientable toric variety YA . We give a methods that\nuses the toric degenerations of Chapter 3 to provide an answer to this question. It is by no\nmeans the only answer.\nBy Corollary 3.5, if A consists of the integer points in a lattice polytope \u2206 which has a\nregular unimodular triangulation \u2206\u03c9 , then there exists a flat deformation of XA within the\nprojective space PA into a limit scheme which is the union of coordinate n-planes\n[\nP\u03c4 .\nlim t.XA =\nt\u21920\n\n\u03c4 \u2208\u2206\u03c9\n\nThe idea here is to find conditions on the triangulation that allow us to compute the real\ndegree of some map f from this deformation. Some triangulations \u2206\u03c9 have a naturally\ndefined linear projection with a nicely defined degree.\nExample 6.6 Consider the triangulation of the hexagon (the HSBC Bank symbol rotated\n45\u25e6 anti-clockwise) shown below with the vertices labeled a, b, and c. Mapping these vertices\nto the corresponding vertices of the simplex defines a piecewise-linear 'folding' map \u03c0\u03c9 whose\ndegree is 4 \u2212 2 = 2.\nb\na\nc\nc\n\n\u03c0\u03c9\n\nc \u2212\u2212\u2192\n\na\n\na\na\n\nb\n\nb\n\nSuppose now that A = \u2206 \u2229 Zn , where \u2206 is a lattice polytope. A triangulation \u2206\u03c9 is\nfoldable if its facet simplices may be properly 2-colored, which is equivalent to there being\na coloring of the vertices A of the triangulation with n + 1 labels, where each simplex\nreceives all n+1 labels [59]. Both the 2-coloring and the vertex-labeling are unique up to\npermuting the colors and labels. The difference in the number of simplices of different colors\nis the signature \u03c3(\u03c9) of the balanced triangulation. Up to a sign, it is the degree of the\ncombinatorial folding map from \u2206 to an n-simplex given by the labeling of A.\nThe vertex labels define a linear projection \u03c0\u03c9 : PA \u2212 \u2192 Pn . Let ea be the standard basis\nvector of PA corresponding to the monomial a \u2208 A and ej for j = 0, 1, . . . , n the standard\nbasis vector of Pn . We assume that the labels in the balanced triangulation take values\n0, 1, . . . , n. Then \u03c0\u03c9 (ea ) = ej , where the vertex a of has label j. The restriction of this\nlinear projection to the coordinate spheres \u03c0\u03c9 : \u222a\u03c4 S \u03c4 \u2192 S n is the geometric counterpart of\nthis combinatorial folding map.\nFrom the geometry of this map, we can show that for t > 0 and small, the restriction f\nof \u03c0\u03c9 to t.YA+ has degree \u03c3(\u03c9). This can be deduced from the real version of the arguments\nused in the algorithmic proof of Koushnirenko's Theorem in Lecture 2. In fact, Figure 3.1\nfrom Lecture 2 is reproduced from this argument in [105]. expand on this??\n69\n\n\fThe restrictions of \u03c0\u03c9 to t.YA+ for t near zero and t = 1 are homotopic, if t.YA \u2229ker(\u03c0\u03c9 ) =\n\u2205, for t \u2208 (0, 1). This condition is not hard to check on specific examples.\n\n6.4\n\nReprise: polynomial systems from posets\n\nSuppose now that P is a poset and A \u2282 {0, 1}P is the set of indicator functions of order\nideals I of P , so that a Wronski polynomial for P has support A. Then \u2206P := conv(A) is\nthe order polytope of P . This was studied by Stanley [116]. Its facet inequalities are\n\uf8f1\ny \u2265\n0\nif y \u2208 P is mininmal\n\uf8f2\n\u2212y \u2265 \u22121\nif y \u2208 P is maximal\nB :\n.\n\uf8f3\nx\u2212y \u2265\n0\nif y \u22d6 x is a cover in P\n\nGive more details in these brief paragraphs It has a unimodular triangulation \u2206\u03c9 whose\nsimplices correspond to linear extensions of P , and it is easy to see that it is regular.\nUnimodular implies that ZA = Zn . Recently, Stanley [117] and others introduced the\nnotion of sign-(im)balance of posets, \u03c3(P ), and it is tautological that \u03c3(\u03c9) = \u03c3(P ). It is\nalso easy to use the description of the facet inequalities to show that col(B) is saturated,\nand if every maximal chain in P has the same parity, then YA is Cox-oriented. This explains\nTheorem 6.1.\nDiscuss the phenomenon of gaps.\n\n6.5\n\nSagbi degenerations\n\nThis method of computing a degree through a limiting process applies to the original result\nof Eremenko and Gabrielov on the degree of the Wronski map in Schubert calculus [33]. The\nGrassmannian Gr(p, m+p) of p-planes in (m+p)-space admits a sagbi degeneration to the\ntoric variety associated to the poset Pp,m which is the product of a chain with p elements\nand a chain with m elements, and one may show that the degree of the Wronski map for\nthe Grassmannian Gr(p, m+p) is equal to the degree of the Wronski map f (the restriction\nof \u03c0\u03c9 ) on YA+ , where A is the set of monomials coming from order ideals of Pp,m . (For this,\nwe use a more general version of the Wronski projection \u03c0\u03c9 which corresponds to the more\ngeneral Wronski polynomial of (6.3).)\nUsing the sagbi degeneration, we can recover the results of Eremenko and Gabrielov.\nIn fact, this connection between the Grassmannian and its toric degeneration, as well as\nbetween Eremenko and Gabrielov's formula for the degree of the Wronski map, the signimbalance of Pp,m , and the geometric folding map was the genesis of this work [105].\n\n6.6\n\nOpen problems\n\nThere is much more to be done in this area. Here are some suggestions.\n\n70\n\n\f1. Give more comprehensive conditions which imply that f , or its lift to some (not necessarily the one given above) double cover of YA is orientable.\n2. Find other methods to give polynomial systems whose degree may be computed or\nestimated.\n3. Find more balanced triangulations (see [60]).\n4. Apply these ideas to specific problems from the applied sciences.\n5. Extend any of this from unmixed systems (all polynomials have the same Newton\npolytope) to more general mixed systems (those whose polynomials have different\nNewton polytopes). We end with an example in this direction which is due to Chris\nHillar.\nExample 6.7 Let P and Q be the two lattice polytopes given below\n(1, 2)\n(0, 1)\n\n(0, 0)\n\nP\n\nQ\n\n(m, 1)\n\n(m, 0)\n\n(2, 1)\n\n(0, 0)\n\nA polynomial with support P has the form\ng := A(x) + yB(X) ,\nwhere A and B are univariate polynomials in x with degree m. Suppose that their coefficients\nare a0 , . . . , am and b0 , . . . , bm , and let h be the polynomial with support Q,\nh := c + dxy + ex2 y + f xy 2 .\nBy Bernstein's Theorem (Theorem 1.2), the mixed system g(x, y) = h(x, y) = 0 will have\n2m + 2 solutions in (C\u00d7 )2 , as 2m + 2 is the mixed volume of P and Q. (For polygons P, Q,\nthe mixed volume is vol(P + Q) \u2212 vol(P ) \u2212 vol(Q).) We can compute an eliminant for this\nsystem by substituting \u2212A(x) for yB(x) in h * B(x)2 , to obtain\ncB(x)2 \u2212 dxA(x)B(x) \u2212 ex2 A(x)B(x) + f xA(x)2 .\nThis has constant term cb20 and leading term \u2212eam bm . If ce > 0 and am bm > 0, then these\nhave different signs, which implies that the mixed system has at least one positive root\n(and hence at least two real roots). This may be ensured by the condition that none of the\ncoefficients vanish and the two linear equations, c + e = am + bm = 0.\n\n71\n\n\fChapter 7:\nEnumerative Real Algebraic\nGeometry\nEnumerative geometry is the art of counting geometric figures satisfying conditions imposed\nby other, fixed, geometric figures. For example, in 1848, Steiner [118] asked how many plane\nconics are tangent to five given conics? His answer, 65 = 7776, turned out to be incorrect, and\nin 1864 Chasles [20] gave the correct answer of 3264. These methods were later systematized\nand used to great effect by Schubert [97], who codified the field of enumerative geometry.\nThis classical work always concerned complex figures. It was only in 1984 that the\nquestion of reality was posed by Fulton [41, p. 55]: \"The question of how many solutions of\nreal equations can be real is still very much open, particularly for enumerative problems.\"\nHe goes on to ask: \"For example, how many of the 3264 conics tangent to five general conics\ncan be real?\" He later determined that all can be real, but did not publish that result.\nRonga, Tognoli, and Vust [90] later gave a careful argument that all 3264 can be real.\nSince this work of Ronga, Tognoli, and Vust, there have been many geometric problems\nfor which it was shown that all solutions may be real. This means that the upper bound of\nd (= number of complex solutions) is sharp for these problems. In this chapter, we describe\nsome of these problems, beginning with the problem of conics, and concentrating on the\nSchubert calculus. A survey of these questions (circa 2002) is given in [112].\n\n7.1\n\n3264 real conics\n\nThe basic idea of the arguments of Fulton and of Ronga, Tognoli, and Vust is to deform the\nsame special configuration. We will sketch the idea in Fulton's construction.\nSuppose that l1 , . . . , l5 are the lines supporting the edges of a convex pentagon and\npi \u2208 li , i = 1, . . . , 5 are points in the interior of the corresponding edge.\nl4\n\nl5\n\np3\n\np4\n\np2\n\np5\nl1\n\nl3\np1\n\nl2\n\n, 3 ), ( 32 , 27 ), (\u2212 12 , 13\n), (\u22121, 1)}, and the corresponding\nThe points in this example are {(0, 0), ( 11\n4 2\n4\n1\n3\nslopes of the lines are 0, 2 , \u22121, 2 , \u22123.\n72\n\n\fFor every subset S of the lines, there are 2min{|S|,5\u2212|S|} conics that are tangent to the\nlines in S and that meet the 5\u2212|S| points not on the lines of S. This is the number of\ncomplex conics, and it does not depend upon the configuration of (generic) points and lines.\nHowever, when the points and lines are chosen in convex position, then all such conics will\nbe real. Altogether, this gives\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n20 50 + 21 51 + 22 52 + 22 53 + 21 54 + 20 55 = 102\n\nreal conics, that, for each i = 1, . . . , 5 either meet pi or are tangent to li . We draw these in\nFigure 7.1. Since our pentagon was asymmetric, exactly 51 of these conics meet each point\n\nFigure 7.1: 102 conics\npi and none of the 51 conics tangent to li are tangent at pi .\nThe idea now is to replace each pair pi \u2208 li by a hyperbola hi that is close to the pair\npi \u2208 li , in that hi lies close to its asymptotes, which are two lines close to li that meet at pi .\nIf we do this for one pair pi \u2208 li , then, for every conic in our configuration, there will be two\nnearby conics tangent to hi . To see this, suppose that i = 1. Then the set C of conics which\nsatisfy one of the conditions \"meet pj \" or \"tangent to lj \" for each j = 2, 3, 4, 5 will form an\nirreducible curve C. For each conic in C that meets p1 , there will be two nearby conics in\nC tangent to h1 near p1 , and for each conic in C tangent to l1 , there will be two nearby\nconics in C tangent to each of the two nearby branches of h1 . We illustrate this when C is\n\n73\n\n\fthe curve of conics tangent to l2 , l3 , l4 , and l5 , showing the conics in C,\np3\n\np4\nl4\n\nl3\np2\np5\nl1\n\n-\n\np1\n\nXXX\ny\n9\u0018\u0018\n\u0018\n\n\b\n*\n\b\n\b\b\n\b\n\nl5\n\nh1\n\nl2\n\nand then a closeup near l1 .\nConics in C\nmeeting p1\n\nConic in C\ntangent to l1\n\nNearby\nconics\n\nHH\n\u0013\nHH\n\u0013\nH\u0013\nH\n\u0013\nH\n\nl1\n\nNearby\nconics\n\nPP\ni\nPP\n\u0010\u0010 h1\n)\u0010\n\u0010\n\n-\n\nFor the configuration of 102 conics of figure 7.1, the hyperbola\nh1 :\n\n(y \u2212\n\n1\nx)(y\n15\n\n+\n\n1\nx)\n15\n\n+\n\n1\n15000\n\n= 0,\n\nis sufficiently close to its asymptotes, which meet at p1 and are sufficiently close to l1 , and\nso each of our 102 conics that meet p1 or are tangent to l1 becomes two conics tangent to\nh1 . We first show the configuration of 102 conics of Figure 7.1 in the neighborhood of l1 ,\n\n6\n\nl1\n74\n\n\fand then the resulting 204 conics in the same region.\n\nThe key to the existence of this construction was that no tangent direction to a conic through\np1 met h1 , which is possible as no conic was tangent to l1 at p1 . Figure 7.2 shows the resulting\n204 conics that are tangent to h1 and, for each i = 2, 3, 4, 5 either contain pi or are tangent\nto li .\n\nFigure 7.2: 204 conics\nIf we now replace p2 \u2208 l2 by a similar nearby hyperbola, then the 204 conics become\n408. Replacing p3 \u2208 l3 by a nearby hyperbola, will give 816 conics. Continuing with p4 \u2208 l4\ngives 1632, and finally replacing p5 \u2208 l5 with a hyperbola gives five hyperbolae, h1 , . . . , h5\nfor which there are 25 * 102 = 3264 real conics tangent to each hi . In this way, the classical\nproblem of 3264 conics can have all of its solutions be real. Observe that this discussion also\ngives a derivation of the number 3264 without reference to intersection theory [39].\n75\n\n\f7.2\n\nSome geometric problems\n\nWe discuss some other geometric problems that can have all their solutions be real.\n\n7.2.1\n\nThe Stewart-Gough platform\n\nThe position of a rigid body in R3 has 6 degrees of freedom (3 rotations and 3 translations).\nThis is exploited in robotics, giving rise to the Stewart-Gough platform [46, 119]: Suppose\nthat we have 6 fixed points A1 , A2 , . . . , A6 in space and 6 points B1 , B2 , . . . , B6 on a rigid\nbody B (the framework of Figure 7.3). The body is controlled by varying each distance li\n\nB1\n\nB3\nB5\n\nl1\n\nB2\nB6\n\nB4\nA1\n\nl2\n\nl3\nA3\n\nl6\nl4\n\nA2\n\nA5\n\nA6\n\nA4\n\nFigure 7.3: A Stewart platform.\nbetween the fixed point Ai and the point Bi on B. This may be accomplished by attaching\nrigid actuators between spherical joints located at the points Ai and Bi , or by suspending\nthe platform from a ceiling with cables. (Apparently, this configuration is often used in\nfactories.)\nGiven a position of the body B, the distances l1 , l2 , . . . , l6 are uniquely determined. A\nfundamental problem is the inverse question (in robotics, this is called the forward problem):\nGiven a platform (positions of the Ai fixed and the relative positions of the Bi specified)\nand a sextuple of distances l1 , l2 , . . . , l6 , what is the position of the platform?\n\n76\n\n\fIt had long been understood that several positions were possible for a given sextuple of\nlengths. This led to the following enumerative problem.\nFor a given (or general) Stewart platform, how many (complex) positions are there\nfor a generic choice of the distances l1 , l2 , . . . , l6 ? How many of these can be real?\nIn the early 1990's, several approaches (including a nice interaction between theory and\ncomputer experimentation [72, 91]) showed that there are 40 complex positions of a general\nStewart platform. The obviously practical question of how many positions could be real\nremained open until 1998, when Dietmaier introduced a novel method involving numerical\nhomotopy to find a platform and value of the distances l1 , l2 , . . . , l6 with all 40 positions real.\nTheorem 7.1 (Dietmaier [27]) All 40 positions can be real.\n\n7.2.2\n\nReal rational cubics through 8 points in P2R\n\nRecall from Section 1.3 that there are 12 singular (rational) cubic curves containing 8 general\npoints in the plane. Kharlamov studied this over the real numbers.\nTheorem 7.2 ([23, Proposition 4.7.3]) Given 8 general points in P2R , there are at least\n8 real rational cubics containing them, and there are choices of the 8 points for which all 12\nrational cubics are real.\nThe bound is a nice exercise in Euler characteristic. A homogeneous cubic has 10 coefficients, so the set of plane cubics is naturally identified with 9-dimensional projective space.\nLet p1 , . . . , p8 be general points in RP2 . As the condition for a cubic to contain a point pi is\nlinear in the coefficients of the cubic, there is a pencil (P1 ) of cubics through these 8 points.\nLet P, Q be two distinct cubics in this pencil, which is then parametrized by sP + tQ for\n[s, t] \u2208 P1 . By B\u00e9zout's Theorem, the cubics P and Q, and hence every cubic in the pencil,\nvanish at a ninth point, p9 .\nIt is not hard to see that there is a unique cubic in the pencil that vanishes at any point\np \u2208 RP2 \u2212 {p1 , . . . , p9 }. A little harder, but still true, is that there is a unique cubic in the\npencil with any given tangent direction at some point pi . In this way, we have maps\nZ := Bl{p1 ,...,p9 } RP2\nC\n\u03c0\n?\n\n?\n\nRP1\n\nRP2\n\nwhere Bl{p1 ,...,p9 } RP2 is the blow-up of RP2 in the 9 points, which is obtained by removing\neach point pi and replacing it with the tangent directions RP1 \u2243 S 1 to RP2 at pi . The map\n\u03c0 is the blow-down, and the map C associates a point of Z to the unique curve in the pencil\nwhich contains that point.\nBecause Z is a blow-up, we may compute its Euler characteristic to obtain\n\u03c7(Z) = \u03c7(RP2 ) \u2212 9 * \u03c7(pt) + 9 * \u03c7(S 1 )\n= 1 \u2212 9 + 0\n= \u22128 .\n77\n\n\fThe key to Theorem 7.2 is to compute the Euler characteristic of Z a second way using the\nmap C : Z \u2192 S 1 . The fibers of this map are the cubic curves in the pencil. Smooth real\ncubics either have one or two topological components,\n\nand hence are homeomorphic to one or two copies of S 1 . In either case, their Euler characteristic is zero, and so the Euler characteristic of Z, \u22128, is the sum of the Euler characteriatics\nof singular fibers of the map C.\nBecause the points p1 , . . . , p8 were general, the only possible singular fibers are nodal\ncubics, and there are two types of real nodal cubics.\n\nThe first is the topological join of two circles and has Euler characteristic \u22121, while the\nsecond is the disjoint union of a circle with a point and therefore has Euler characteristic 1.\nThus, if n is the number of nodal cubics in the pencil and s is the number with a solitary\npoint, then we have n + s \u2264 12 (as there are 12 complex rational cubics), and s \u2212 n = \u22128.\nThere are three solutions to this system, (n, s) \u2208 {(8, 0), (9, 1), (10, 2)}. Thus there are\nat least 8 real cubics through the 8 points, and this is the derivation of the Welschinger\nnumber W3 = 8. Moreover, if there are 2 cubics in the pencil with solitary points, then all\n12 rational cubics will be real. Such a pencil is generated by the two cubics given below,\nwhose curves we also display.\nh\nhhhh\nhhh\nhhh\n\n(y + 9x \u2212 28)2 = 4x2 (x \u2212 1)\n\n(x + 9y \u2212 28)2 = 4y 2(y \u2212 1)\n\nWe conclude that there will be 12 real rational cubics interpolating any subset of 8 of the 9\npoints where these two cubics meet.\nThe question of how many of the Nd (1.6) rational curves of degree d which interpolate\n3d\u22121 points in RP2 can be real remains open. (This was posed in [106].)\n\n78\n\n\f7.2.3\n\nCommon tangent lines to 2n\u22122 spheres in Rn\n\nHow many common tangent lines are there to 2n\u22122 spheres in Rn ? For example, when\nn = 3, how many common tangent lines are there to four spheres in R3 ? (The number 2n\u22122\nis the dimension of the space of lines in Rn and is necessary for there to be finitely many\ncommon tangents.) Despite its simplicity, this question does not seem to have been asked\nclassically, but rather arose in computational geometry. Macdonald, Pach, and Theobald [77]\ngave an elementary argument that four spheres with the same radius in R3 can have at most\n12 common tangents. Then they considered the symmetric configuration where the spheres\nare centered at the vertices of a regular tetrahedron. If the spheres overlap pairwise, but\nno three have a common point, then there will be exactly 12 common real tangents, as\nillustrated in Figure 7.4.\n\nFigure 7.4: Four spheres with 12 common tangents.\nThe general case was established soon after [114].\nTheorem 7.3 2n \u2212 2 general spheres in Rn (n \u2265 3) have 3 * 2n\u22121 complex common tangent\nlines, and there are 2n \u2212 2 such spheres with all common tangent lines real.\nThe same elementary arguments of Macdonald, Pach, and Theobald give a bound valid\nfor all n and for spheres of any radius, and a generalization of the symmetric configuration\nof Figure 7.4 gives a configuration of 2n \u2212 2 spheres having 3 * 2n\u22121 common real tangents.\nMegyesi [78] showed that this result for n = 3 remains true if the spheres have coplanar\ncenters (Figure 7.5), but that there can only be 8 common real tangents (out of 12 complex\nones) if the spheres have the same radii (Figure 7.6).\n79\n\n\fFigure 7.5: Four spheres with coplanar centers and 12 common tangents.\n\nFigure 7.6: Four equal spheres with coplanar centers and 8 common tangents.\nThe spheres in Figures 7.4 and 7.5 are not disjoint, in fact their union is connected.\nFulton asked if it were possible for 4 disjoint spheres to have 12 common real tangents. It\nturns out that a perturbation of the configuration of Figure 7.5 gives four pairwise disjoint\n\n80\n\n\fspheres with 12 common tangents, as we show below.\n\nThe three large spheres\u221ahave radius 4/5 and are centered at the vertices of an equilateral\ntriangle of side length 3, while the smaller sphere has radius 1/4 and is centered on the\naxis of symmetry of the triangle, but at a distance of 35/100 from the plane of the triangle.\nIt remains an open question whether it is possible for four disjoint unit spheres to have 12\ncommon tangents.\n\n7.3\n\nSchubert calculus\n\nThe largest class of problems which have been studied from the perspective of having all\nsolutions real come from the classical Schubert calculus of enumerative geometry, which\ninvolves linear spaces meeting other linear spaces. The simplest nontrivial example illustrates\nsome of the vivid geometry behind this class of problems. Consider the following question:\nHow many line transversals are there to four given lines in space?\nTo answer this, first consider three lines. They lie on a unique hyperboloid. (See Figure 7.7.) This hyperboloid has two rulings by lines. The three lines are in one ruling, and\nthe other ruling (which is drawn on the hyperboloid in Figure 7.7) consists of the lines which\nmeet the three given lines.\nThe fourth line will meet the hyperboloid in two points (the hyperboloid is defined by\na quadratic polynomial). Through each point of intersection there will be one line in the\nsecond family, and that line will meet our four given lines. In this way, we see that the\nanswer to the question is 2. Note that the fourth line may be drawn so that it meets the\nhyperboloid in two real points, and both solution lines will be real when this happens.\nLet Gr(p, m+p) be the Grassmannian of p-dimensional linear subspaces (p-planes) in\nan (m+p)-dimensional vector space, which is an algebraic manifold of dimension mp. The\nSchubert calculus involves fairly general incidence conditions imposed on p-planes H. These\n81\n\n\fFigure 7.7: Hyperboloid containing three lines.\ngeneral conditions are imposed by flags, which are sequences of linear subspaces, one contained in the next. More specifically, a flag F\u2022 is a sequence\nF\u2022 : F1 \u2282 F2 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Fm+p\u22121 \u2282 Fm+p ,\nwhere Fi is a linear subspace having dimension i.\nThese general conditions are called Schubert conditions and are\n\u0001 indexed by sequences\n\u03b1 : 1 \u2264 \u03b11 < \u03b12 < * * * < \u03b1p < m+p of integers. Write [m+p]\nfor the set of all such\np\nsequences. The set of all p-planes satisfying the condition \u03b1 imposed by the flag F\u2022 is a\nSchubert variety, defined by\nX\u03b1 F\u2022 := {H \u2208 Gr(p, m+p) | dim H \u2229 F\u03b1j \u2265 j\n\nfor j = 1, . . . , p} .\n\nThis is a subvariety of the Grassmannian of dimension |\u03b1| := \u03b11 \u2212 1 + \u03b12 \u2212 2 + * * * + \u03b1p \u2212 p.\nIts codimension is mp \u2212 |\u03b1|.\nIf K is a linear subspace of codimension p and F\u2022 is a flag with Fm = K, then\nX F\u2022 := X(m,m+2,...,m+p) F\u2022 = {H | H \u2229 K 6= {0}} .\nThe condition that H meets K is is called a simple Schubert condition and X F\u2022 is a simple\nSchubert variety. More generally, a special Schubert variety of codimension a is\nXa F\u2022 := X(m+1\u2212a,m+2,...,m+p) F\u2022 = {H | H \u2229 Fm+1\u2212a 6= {0}} .\n\u0001\nP\ni\nwith\nTheorem 7.4 Given Schubert conditions \u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1n in [m+p]\ni (mp\u2212|\u03b1 |) = mp,\np\nthere exist real flags F\u20221 , F\u20222 , . . . , F\u2022n such that the intersection\nn\n\\\n\ni=1\n\nX\u03b1i F\u2022i\n\nis transverse with all points real.\n82\n\n(7.1)\n\n\fP\nThe numerical condition that i (mp \u2212 |\u03b1i |) = mp implies that the expected dimension\nof the intersection is zero. If the flags F\u2022i are in general position, then the Kleiman-Bertini\nTheorem [67] implies that the intersection is in fact transverse and zero-dimensional, so\nthere will be finitely many complex p-planes satisfying the incidence conditions \u03b1i imposed\nby general flags, and these p-planes are exactly the points in the intersection.\nTheorem 7.4 was proved in several stages. First, when p = 2 [107], and then for any p, but\nonly for special Schubert conditions [108], and then finally for general Schubert conditions\nby Vakil [127].\n\n7.4\n\nQuantum Schubert calculus\n\nGiven points s1 , s2 , . . . , sd(m+p)+mp \u2208 P1 and m-planes K1 , K2 , . . . , Kd(m+p)+mp in Cm+p , there\nare finitely many rational curves \u03b3 : P1 \u2192 Gr(p, m+p) of degree d so that\n\u03b3(si ) \u2229 Ki 6= {0}\n\ni = 1, 2, . . . , d(m+p) + mp .\n\n(7.2)\n\nThese are simple quantum Schubert conditions. More generally, one could (but we will\nnot) impose the condition that the p-plane \u03b3(si ) lie in some predetermined Schubert variety.\nThe number of solutions to such problems are certain Gromov-Witten invariants of the\nGrassmannian, and may be computed by the quantum Schubert calculus [8, 54, 102, 126].\nTheorem 7.5 ([109]) There exist real points s1 , s2 , . . . , sd(m+p)+mp \u2208 RP1 and real mplanes K1 , K2 , . . . , Kd(m+p)+mp in Rm+p so that every rational curve \u03b3 : P1 \u2192 Gr(p, m+P )\nof degree d satisfying (7.2) is real.\n\n7.5\n\nTheorem of Mukhin, Tarasov, and Varchenko\n\nIn May of 1995, Boris Shapiro communicated to the author a remarkable conjecture that he\nand his brother Michael had made concerning reality in the Schubert calculus. They conjectured that there would only be real points in a zero-dimensional intersection of Schubert varieties given by flags osculating the rational normal curve. Subsequent computation [92, 110]\ngave strong evidence for the conjecture and revealed that the intersection should be transverse. Partial results were obtained [108, 34], and the full conjecture was proven by Mukhin,\nTarasov, and Varchenko [81]. They later gave a second proof [82], which different from their\noriginal proof and gave a proof of transversality.\nThis Shapiro Conjecture has been a motivating conjecture for the study of reality in the\nSchubert calculus with several interesting (and as-yet-unproven) generalizations that we will\ndiscuss in subsequent chapters. Let \u03b3 be the rational normal (or moment) curve in Cm+p ,\nwhich we will take to be the image of the map\n\u03b3(t) = (1, t, t2 , . . . , tm+p\u22121 ) \u2208 Cm+p ,\ndefined for t \u2208 C. Given a point t \u2208 C, the osculating flag F\u2022 (t) is the flag of subspaces\nwhose i-plane is the linear span of the first i derivatives of \u03b3, evaluated at t\nFi (t) := span{\u03b3(t), \u03b3 \u2032 (t), \u03b3 \u2032\u2032 (t), . . . , \u03b3 (i\u22121) (t)} .\n83\n\n\fThis flag makes sense for t \u2208 P1 . Here is the strongest form of the Shapiro conjecture that\nhas been proven [82].\n\u0001\nP\nTheorem 7.6 If \u03b11 , \u03b12, . . . , \u03b1n \u2208 [m+p]\nare Schubert conditions satisfying i (mp\u2212|\u03b1i |) =\np\nmp, then, for every choice of n distinct points s1 , s2 , . . . , sn \u2208 RP1 , the intersection\nn\n\\\n\ni=1\n\nX\u03b1i F\u2022 (si )\n\nis transverse with all points real.\nIt is instructive to consider this for the problem of two lines that we saw in Section 7.3.\nAn osculating line will be a tangent line to the rational normal curve \u03b3. The Shapiro\nConjecture asserts that given four lines that are tangent to the rational normal curve at real\npoints, there will be two lines meeting all four, and the two lines will be real. As before,\nfirst consider three lines tangent to the rational normal curve. They will lie in one ruling of\na quadric surface, and the other ruling consists of the lines meeting all four.\nFor example, if we let \u03b3(t) = (6t2 \u2212 1, 27 t3 + 23 t, \u2212 12 t3 + 23 t), and consider tangent lines\nl(\u22121), l(0), and l(1) to \u03b3,\nl(\u00b11) : (5, \u00b15, 1) + u(\u00b11, 1, 0)\n\nu \u2208 R,\n\nl(0) : (\u22121, 0, 0) + u(0, 1, 1)\n\nthen the quadric is x2 \u2212 y 2 + z 2 = 1. We display this in Figure 7.8, together with the rational\nnormal curve. Since any three real points on any real rational normal curve may be carried\n\nQ\n\nl(1)\n\n\u03b3\n\nl(\u22121)\n\nl(0)\n\nFigure 7.8: Quadric containing three lines tangent to the rational normal curve.\nto any three real points on any other real rational normal curve by an automorphism of\nprojective 3-space, we can assume that we are in the situation of Figure 7.8.\nThe rational normal curve \u03b3 (a cubic) meets the quadric tangentially at the points where\nit is tangent to the lines. Since the total multiplicity of its intersection with the quadric\nis six, these are its only points of contact. In particular, \u03b3 always lies on one side of the\n84\n\n\fquadric, looping around on the inside. In this way we can see that a fourth tangent line\nto the rational normal curve must meet the quadric in two real points, giving the two real\ntransversals asserted by Shapiro's Conjecture.\nIt is no loss to assume that the fourth tangent line is tangent at some point \u03b3(v) on the\narc between points \u03b3(\u22121) and \u03b3(0). As illustrated in Figure 7.9, the tangent line l(v) does\nindeed meet the hyperboloid in two real points.\nl(0)\nl(v)\n\nl(\u22121)\n\u03b3\n\nl(1)\n\nFigure 7.9: Configuration in the throat of quadric.\n\n85\n\n\fChapter 8:\nThe Shapiro Conjecture for\nGrassmannians\nIn Chapter 7, we considered the rational normal curve \u03b3 in Cm+p , which we took to be the\nimage of the map\n\u03b3(t) = (1, t, t2 , . . . , tm+p\u22121) \u2208 Cm+p ,\ndefined for t \u2208 C. For a point t \u2208 C, the osculating flag F\u2022 (t) is the flag of subspaces whose\ni-plane is the linear span of \u03b3(t) and the the first i\u22121 derivatives of \u03b3, evaluated at t,\nFi (t) := span{\u03b3(t), \u03b3 \u2032 (t), \u03b3 \u2032\u2032 (t), . . . , \u03b3 (i\u22121) (t)} .\nWe may also define F\u2022 (\u221e) to be the limit as s \u2192 0 of F\u2022 ( 1s ), to get a family of flags F\u2022 (t)\nfor t \u2208 P1 .\nWe work in the Grassmannian Gr(p, m+p) of p-planes in Cm+p . Recall\n\u0001 from Section 7.3\n[m+p]\nthat Schubert varieties are indexed by Schubert conditions \u03b1 \u2208\n, which are integer\np\nsequences \u03b1 : 1 \u2264 \u03b11 < \u03b12 < * * * < \u03b1p \u2264 m+p. Given a flag F\u2022 , the corresponding Schubert\nvariety is\nX\u03b1 F\u2022 = {H \u2208 Gr(p, m+p) | dim H \u2229 F\u03b1j \u2265 j for j = 1, . . . , p} .\nP\nThis has dimension |\u03b1| := j (\u03b1j \u2212 j).\nWe investigate the Shapiro conjecture for Grassmannians (Theorem of Mukhin, Tarasov,\nand Varchenko).\nP\nTheorem 7.6 If \u03b11 , \u03b12, . . . , \u03b1n are Schubert conditions with i (mp \u2212 |\u03b1i |) = mp, then, for\nevery choice of n distinct points s1 , s2 , . . . , sn \u2208 RP1 , the intersection\nn\n\\\n\ni=1\n\nX\u03b1i F\u2022 (si )\n\nis transverse with all points real.\nIn particular, we show that a special case of this theorem is equivalent to the statement\n(Theorem 1.9) of the Shapiro conjecture from the Introduction, and then prove this special\ncase in an asymptotic sense.\n\n8.1\n\nThe Wronski map\n\nWhen all the Schubert conditions are simple (so that \u03b1 = = m, m + 2, . . . , m+p and\n|\u03b1| = mp \u2212 1), the Shapiro conjecture has another formulation in terms of the Wronski\n86\n\n\fmap. The Wronskian of a list f1 (t), f2 (t), . . . , fm (t) of polynomials of degree m+p\u22121 is the\ndeterminant\n!\n\u0012 \u0013i\u22121\nd\nfj (t)\n,\nWr (f1 , f2 , . . . , fm ) := det\ndt\ni,j=1,...,m\n\nwhich is a polynomial of degree mp, when the polynomials f1 (t), f2 (t), . . . , fm (t) are generic\namong all polynomials of degree m+p\u22121.\nUp to a scalar factor, this Wronskian depends only upon the linear span of the polynomials f1 (t), f2 (t), . . . , fm (t). Removing these ambiguities, we get the Wronski map\nWr : Gr(m, m+p) \u2212\u2192 Pmp ,\n\n(8.1)\n\nwhere Gr(m, p) is the Grassmannian of m-planes in the space of polynomials of degree\nm+p\u22121, and Pmp is the space of polynomials of degree mp, modulo scalars.\n\n8.1.1\n\nSome linear algebra\n\nLet us begin with the moment (rational normal) curve. For t \u2208 C, set\n\u03b3(t) = (1, t, t2 , . . . , tm+p\u22121 ) \u2208 Cm+p .\nLet \u0393 = \u0393(t) : Cm \u2192 Cm+p be the map such that\n\u0393(ei ) = \u03b3 (i\u22121) (t) ,\n\n(8.2)\n\nthe (i\u22121)-th derivative of \u03b3. (We will take e1 , e2 , . . . to be the standard basis vectors of the\nvector space in which we are working.)\nA polynomial f corresponds to a linear form (also written f ):\nf : Cm+p \u2212\u2192 C\n\nf \u25e6 \u03b3(t) = f (t) .\n\nso that\n\nThe matrix in the definition of the Wronskian is the matrix of the composition\n\u0393(t)\n\n\u03a8\n\nCm \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Cm+p \u2212\u2212\u2192 Cm ,\n\n(8.3)\n\nwhere the columns of \u03a8 are the linear forms defining the polynomials f1 , f2 , . . . , fm . Now\nsuppose that H is a basis for the kernel of the map \u03a8. We consider H to be a map\nH\nCp \u2212\u2212\u2192 Cm+p , which we sum with \u0393(t) to get a map\n[\u0393(t):H]\n\nCm+p = Cm \u2295 Cp \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Cm+p .\nThis map is invertible if and only if the composition (8.3) is invertible. Thus, up to a\nconstant, we have\nWr (f1 , f2 , . . . , fm ) = det[\u0393(t) : H] ,\n(8.4)\nas both are polynomials of the same degree with the same roots. (Strictly speaking, we\nneed the Wronskian to have distinct roots for this argument. The general case follows via a\nlimiting argument.)\n87\n\n\fWe obtain a useful formula for the Wronskian when we expand the determinant (8.4)\nalong the columns of \u0393(t)\nX\n(8.5)\nWr (f1 , f2 , . . . , fm ) = det[\u0393(t) : H] =\n(\u22121)|\u03b1| p\u03b1 (\u0393(t)) * p\u03b1c (H) .\n\u03b1\n\n\u0001\n[m+p]\n\nHere, the sum is over all \u03b1 \u2208 m , which are choices {\u03b11 < \u03b12 < * * * < \u03b1m } \u2282 [m+p] of\nm distinct rows of the matrix \u0393(t). Also, \u03b1c = [m+p] \u2212 \u03b1 are the complimentary rows of H,\nand p\u03b1 (\u0393(t)) is the \u03b1th maximal minor of \u0393(t), which is the determinant of the submatrix\n\u0001\n.\nof \u0393(t) formed by the rows in \u03b1, and similarly for p\u03b1c (H). Observe that \u03b1c \u2208 [m+p]\np\n\nThere is a similar expansion for the Wronskian using the composition (8.3). Take the\ntop exterior power (\u2227m ) of this composition,\n\u2227m \u0393(t)\n\n\u2227m \u03a8\n\nC = \u2227m Cm \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u2227m Cm+p \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u2227m Cm = C ,\nwhere we have used the ordered basis of Cm so that \u2227m Cm = C * e1 \u2227 e2 \u2227 . . . \u2227 em , which\nidentifies \u2227m Cm with C. Then \u2227m \u0393(t) is simply a vector in \u2227m Cm+p and \u2227m \u03a8 is a covector\n\u0001\n,\nfor \u2227m Cm+p . If we use the basis e\u03b1 := e\u03b11 \u2227 e\u03b12 \u2227 . . . \u2227 e\u03b1m for \u2227m Cm+p , where \u03b1 \u2208 [m+p]\nm\nthen we see that the Wronskian has the form\nX\np\u03b1 (\u0393(t)) * p\u03b1 (\u03a8) .\nWr (f1 , f2 , . . . , fm ) =\n[m+p]\n\u03b1\u2208( m )\nHere, p\u03b1 (\u0393(t)) and p\u03b1 (\u03a8) are the \u03b1th coordinates of the corresponding vector/covector\n(which are the \u03b1th maximal minors of the corresponding matrices). Equating these two\nexpressions for the Wronskian gives the equality (again up to a constant)\nX\nX\n(\u22121)|\u03b1| p\u03b1 (\u0393(t)) * p\u03b1c (H) =\np\u03b1 (\u0393(t)) * p\u03b1 (\u03a8) .\n\u03b1\u2208([m+p]\n\u03b1\u2208([m+p]\nm )\nm )\nThis argument does not use much about the matrix \u0393(t), besides that it depends upon\nan indeterminate t. Replacing \u0393(t) by a matrix of indeterminates proves an interesting (and\nwell-known) matrix identity.\nProposition 8.1 Suppose that \u03a8 and H are matrices of format n by k and (n \u2212 k) by n\nrespectively such that \u03a8 \u25e6 H = 0 (the image of H is the kernel of \u03a8). Then there is a\nconstant C so that\np\u03b1 (\u03a8) = C * (\u22121)|\u03b1| p\u03b1c (H) ,\n\u0001\nfor all \u03b1 \u2208 [n]\n.\nk\n\n8.1.2\n\nConnection to Schubert calculus\n\nWe explore some geometric consequences of the determinantal formulas (8.4) and (8.5).\nLet H be the column space of the matrix H, which is the kernel of the map \u03a8. Then H\nis a point in the Grassmannian Gr(p, m+p). From the definition (8.2) of \u0393, we see that\n88\n\n\fthe column space of the matrix \u0393(t) is the m-plane Fm (t) osculating the rational normal\ncurve \u03b3 at the point \u03b3(t). From (8.4) and (8.5), we see that s is a zero of the Wronskian\n\u03a6(t) := Wr (f1 (t), f2 (t), . . . , fm (t)) if and only if\n0 = det[\u0393(s) : H] .\nThis implies that there is a linear dependence among the columns of this matrix and thus\nthere is a nontrivial intersection between the subspaces Fm (s) and H.\nSuppose that a polynomial \u03a6(t) has distinct zeroes s1 , s2 , . . . , smp . Then the columns of\nthe matrix H are linear forms cutting out the linear span of polynomials f1 (t), f2 (t), . . . , fm (t)\nof degree m+p\u22121 having Wronskian \u03a6(t)\n\u21d4 the p-plane H meets the m-plane Fm (si ) nontrivially for each i = 1, 2, . . . , mp,\n\u21d4 H lies in the Schubert variety X F\u2022 (si ) for each i = 1, 2, . . . , mp.\nIf the roots s1 , . . . , smp are all real, then the Shapiro Conjecture (Theorem 7.6) asserts that\nall such p-planes H are real, and there are the expected number of them. In this way, the\nsecond part of Theorem 1.9 is a consequence of Theorem 7.6.\nSecond part of Theorem 1.9 If the polynomial \u03a6(t) \u2208 Pmp has simple real roots then\nthere are #mp real points in Wr \u22121 (F ).\nRecall from Chapter 1 the formula for the degree of the Wronski map,\n#mp =\n\n1!2! * * * (m\u22121)! * [mp]!\n,\np!(p+1)! * * * (m+p\u22121)!\n\n(1.4)\n\nwhich is the number of inverse images of a regular value of the Wronski map. The first part\nof Theorem 1.9, which asserts that all points are real in a fiber of the Wronski map over\na polynomial with only real roots, follows from the second by a limiting argument that we\ngive in Section 8.2.3.\n\n8.2\n\nAsymptotic form of the Shapiro Conjecture is true\n\nIt is not too hard to show that the conclusion of the Shapiro conjecture when all conditions\n\u03b1i are simple, \u03b1i = , holds for some s1 , . . . , smp \u2208 R. We give a (by now) standard argument\nfor the following asymptotic form of the Shapiro conjecture, which was given in [108], and\nindependently in [33].\nTheorem 8.2 There exist real numbers s1 , s2 , . . . , smp such that\nX F\u2022 (s1 ) \u2229 X F\u2022 (s2 ) \u2229 * * * \u2229 X F\u2022 (smp )\nis transverse with all points real.\n\n89\n\n\fThe proof is a version of Schubert's principle of degeneration to special position and\nthe same ideas can be used to establish similar results for other flag manifolds and related\nvarieties, such as Theorem 7.5 on rational curves in Grassmannians.\nInterchanging \u03b1 with \u03b1c , the expansion (8.5) becomes (up to a sign)\nX\ndet[\u0393(t) : H] =\np\u03b1 (H) * (\u22121)|\u03b1| p\u03b1c (\u0393(t)) .\n\u03b1\u2208([m+p]\np )\nWe convert this into a very useful form by expanding the minor p\u03b1c (\u0393(t)).

The pivots \u03b2 of a matrix M in M\u03b1 will occur\nweakly to the left of the columns indexed by \u03b1, so that \u03b2 \u2264 \u03b1, and all possibilities \u03b2 can\noccur.\nIn particular, this shows that the set of p-planes H parameterized by matrices in M\u03b1\nis the union of the Schubert cells indexed by \u03b2 for \u03b2 \u2264 \u03b1 in the Bruhat order. This is\na closed subset of the Grassmannian, in fact it is one of the Schubert varieties defined in\nChapter 7. To see this, let e1 , e2 , . . . , em+p be basis vectors corresponding to the columns of\nour matrices. For each i = 1, . . . , m+p let Fi be the linear span of the vectors e1 , e2 , . . . , ei .\nFrom the form of matrices in M\u03b1 , we see that if H is the row space of a matrix in M\u03b1 , then\nwe have\ndim H \u2229 F\u03b1j \u2265 j\nfor j = 1, . . . , p .\nThese dimension inequalities define the Schubert variety X\u03b1 F\u2022 . Note that if H \u2208 X\u03b1 F\u2022 ,\nthen p\u03b2 (H) = 0 unless \u03b2 \u2264 \u03b1. Write X\u03b1\u25e6 F\u2022 for the Schubert cell consisting of those H of the\nform (8.7).\nThe key lemma in our proof of Theorem 8.2 is due essentially to Schubert [99].\n91\n\n\fLemma 8.3 For any \u03b1 \u2208\n\n[m+p]\np\n\n\u0001\n\n,\n\nX\u03b1 F\u2022 \u2229 {H | p\u03b1 (H) = 0} =\n\n[\n\n\u03b2\u22d6\u03b1\n\nX\u03b2 F\u2022 .\n\nHere \u03b2\u22d6\u03b1 means that \u03b2 < \u03b1, but there is no index \u03bc in the Bruhat order with \u03b2 < \u03bc < \u03b1.\nThis is easy to see set-theoretically, as for H \u2208 X\u03b1 F\u2022 we have p\u03b2 (H) = 0 unless \u03b2 \u2264 \u03b1.\nIt is also easy to see that this is true on the generic point of each Schubert variety X\u03b2 F\u2022\nfor \u03b2 \u22d6 \u03b1. Fix some index \u03b2 with \u03b2 \u22d6 \u03b1. Then there is a unique index k with \u03b2k = \u03b1k \u2212 1,\nand for all other indices i, \u03b2i = \u03b1i . Consider the subset of the matrices M\u03b1 , where we require\nthe entries in row i and column \u03b2i to be 1, and write xk,\u03b1k for the entry in row k and column\n\u03b1k\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u2217 *** \u2217 1 0 *** 0 0\n0\n0 *** 0 0 0 *** 0\n..\n..\n..\n..\n.. .. ..\n.. \uf8f7\n..\n\uf8ec ..\n.\n.\n. 0\n.\n.\n. . .\n.\uf8f7\n\uf8ec.\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\u2217 * * * \u2217 0 \u2217 * * * \u2217 1 xk,\u03b1k 0 * * * 0 0 0 * * * 0\uf8f7 .\n(8.8)\n\uf8ec.\n.. \uf8f7\n.. .. ..\n..\n.. ..\n..\n\uf8ec ..\n\uf8f7\n.\n.\uf8f8\n. . .\n. 0\n. .\n0\n\uf8ed\n..\n..\n\u2217 *** \u2217 0 \u2217 *** \u2217 .\n\u2217 *** \u2217 1 0 *** 0\n.\n\nThe row spans of these matrices form a dense subset of the Schubert variety X\u03b1 F\u2022 , and\ntherefore define a coordinate patch for X\u03b1 F\u2022 . If we set xk,\u03b1k = 0, then we get all matrices\nof the form (8.7), but for the index \u03b2.\nIf H is the row space of a matrix in this set (8.8), then p\u03b1 (H) = xk,\u03b1k . Thus, on\nthis coordinate patch for X\u03b1 F\u2022 , the vanishing of the Pl\u00fccker coordinate p\u03b1 cuts out the\nSchubert variety X\u03b2 F\u2022 , scheme-theoretically. Repeating this local argument for each \u03b2 \u22d6 \u03b1,\nproves (8.3), at least at the generic point of each component X\u03b2 F\u2022 (which is sufficient for our\npurposes). More careful arguments show this is true even at the level of their homogeneous\nideals.\n\n8.2.2\n\nAsymptotic form of Shapiro Conjecture\n\nWe now have everything that we need to prove Theorem 8.2. We will prove a stronger\nstatement using induction on the Bruhat order (sometimes called Schubert induction).\n\u0001\nLemma 8.4 There exist real numbers s1 , s2 , . . . , smp such that for all \u03b1 \u2208 [m+p]\n,\np\nX\u03b1 F\u2022 \u2229\n\n|\u03b1|\n\\\n\ni=1\n\nX F\u2022 (si )\n\n(8.9)\n\nis transverse with all points of intersection real.\nThe statement of Theorem 8.2 is the case \u03b1 = m+1, m+2, . . . , m+p, when X\u03b1 F\u2022 is the\nGrassmannian.\n\n92\n\n\fRemark 8.5 It is not hard to see (it is equivalent to the Pl\u00fccker formula [88] for rational\ncurves and was noted by Eisenbud and Harris [30, Theorem 2.3]) that the intersection (8.9)\nlies in the Schubert cell X\u03b1\u25e6 F\u2022 for the index \u03b1. That is, every point H in the intersection (8.9)\nhas row-reduced echelon form (8.7), for the index \u03b1.\nObserve that when \u03b1 = 1, 2, . . . , p, then |\u03b1| = 0 and the Schubert variety X\u03b1 F\u2022 consists\nof the single point {Fp }. Thus the base case of the induction to prove Lemma 8.4 is trivial,\nas there is no intersection to contend with.\nSuppose that we have real numbers s1 , . . . , sj such that, for\u0001 each \u03b1 with |\u03b1| = j the\nintersection (8.9) is transverse with all points real. Let \u03b1 \u2208 [m+p]\nwith |\u03b1| = j+1. Observe\np\nthat by (8.6) the intersection X\u03b1 F\u2022 \u2229 X F\u2022 (t) is defined by the single polynomial equation\nX\nfor H \u2208 X\u03b1 F\u2022 .\ntmp\u2212|\u03b2| V\u03b2 c p\u03b2 (H) = 0\n\u03b2\n\nSince p\u03b2 (H) = 0 unless \u03b2 \u2264 \u03b1, this becomes\nX\ntmp\u2212|\u03b2| V\u03b2 c p\u03b2 (H) = 0 .\n\u03b2\u2264\u03b1\n\nDividing by the lowest power tmp\u2212|\u03b1| of t, this becomes\nX\nX\nt|\u03b1|\u2212|\u03b2|\u22121V\u03b2 c p\u03b2 (H) = 0 .\nt|\u03b1|\u2212|\u03b2| V\u03b2 c p\u03b2 (H) = V\u03b1c p\u03b1 (H) + t *\n\u03b2<\u03b1\n\n\u03b2\u2264\u03b1\n\nSince V\u03b1c 6= 0, we see that in the limit as t \u2192 0, this equation becomes p\u03b1 (H) = 0. Using\nthe lemma of Schubert (8.3), we conclude that\n[\nlim (X\u03b1 F\u2022 \u2229 X F\u2022 (t)) = X\u03b1 F\u2022 \u2229 {H | p\u03b1 (H) = 0} =\nX\u03b2 F\u2022 .\n(8.10)\nt\u21920\n\n\u03b2\u22d6\u03b1\n\nBy our induction assumption on j, each intersection\nX\u03b2 F\u2022 \u2229\n\nj\n\\\n\ni=1\n\nX F\u2022 (si )\n\nis transverse with all points real, and by Remark 8.5 the intersection is contained in the\nSchubert cell X\u03b2\u25e6 F\u2022 . Since the Schubert cells are disjoint, we conclude that the intersection\n\u0010[\n\n\u03b1\u22d6\u03b2\n\nX\u03b2 F\u2022\n\n\u0011\n\n\u2229\n\nj\n\\\n\ni=1\n\nX F\u2022 (si )\n\nis transverse with all points real. By the computation of the limit (8.10), and the observation\nthat transversality is preserved by small perturbations, we see that there is a number 0 < \u03b5\u03b1\nsuch that if t \u2264 \u03b5\u03b1 then\nj\n\\\nX F\u2022 (si )\nX\u03b1 F\u2022 \u2229 X F\u2022 (t) \u2229\ni=1\n\n93\n\n\fis transverse with all points real.\nWe complete the induction by setting sj+1 to be the minimum of the numbers \u03b5\u03b1 where\n|\u03b1| = j + 1. This proves Theorem 8.2.\nSimilar asymptotic arguments are behind the proof of Theorem 7.5, which proved reality\nin the quantum Schubert calculus, as well as results for the classical flag manifolds and for\nthe orthogonal Grassmannian [111].\nRemark 8.6 The proof of Theorem 8.2 used induction to show that the intersection (8.9)\nis transverse with all points real. In fact, it gives an inductive method to construct all the\npoints of intersection. The induction began with \u03b1 = 1, 2, . . . , p so that |\u03b1| = 0 and the\nSchubert variety X\u03b1 F\u2022 consists of the single point {Fp }.

Starting at one of the points in (8.11)\nand tracing the path from t = 0 back to t = sj+1 gives a point in the intersection (8.9) for \u03b1\nwith |\u03b1| = j+1, and all such points in the intersection (8.9) arise in this manner. Following\npaths along a general curve in C (as opposed to the line segment [0, sj+1]) constructs points\nin the intersection (8.9) where sj+1 is any complex number. This is the idea behind the\nnumerical Pieri homotopy algorithm, which was proposed in [51] and implemented in [53].\nIts power was demonstrated in [73], which used the Pieri homotopy algorithm to compute\nall solutions to a Schubert problem on Gr(3, 9) with 17589 solutions.\nIf \u03b4(\u03b1) is the number of points in the intersection (8.9), then this limiting process also\ngives the recursion along the Bruhat order \u03b4(\u03b1),\n\u03b4(1, 2, . . . , p) = 1 ,\nP\n\u03b4(\u03b1) =\n\u03b2\u22d6\u03b1 \u03b4(\u03b2) .\n\n(8.12)\n\nSchubert discovered this recursion [98] and used it to compute the number \u03b4(567) = 462\nwhen m = 4 and p = 3. This is the number #4,3 given by the formula,\n1!2! * * * (m\u22121)! * [mp]!\n,\np!(p+1)! * * * (m+p\u22121)!\n\n(1.4)\n\nwhich is also due to Schubert, as he solved his recursion to obtain a closed formula. This\nrecursion shows that the number \u03b4(\u03b1) may be interpreted combinatorially as the number of\n94\n\n\fpaths from the bottom of the Bruhat order to the element \u03b1. In fact to each solution we\nconstructed in (8.9), we may associate a path from 1, 2, . . . , p to \u03b1.\nFigure 8.1 shows the Bruhat order in this case when m = 4 and p = 3 and the recursion\nfor the numbers \u03b4(\u03b1).\n\n567\n\n462\n467\n\n462\n\n367\n\n252\n457\n\n267\n357\n\n167\n157\n\n35\n346\n\n9\n345\n\n5\n\n4\n\n236 245\n\n127\n\n10\n\n21\n\n16\n6\n\n1\n3\n\n235\n\n21\n\n42\n\n5\n\n5\n\n136 145\n126\n\n56\n\n14\n\n237 246\n\n137 146\n\n42\n\n70\n\n347 356\n\n247 256\n\n147 156\n\n168\n\n14\n\n456\n\n257\n\n210\n\n84\n\n5\n\n2\n3\n\n1\n\n135\n\n2\n234\n\n125\n\n1\n\n1\n\n134\n\n1\n\n124\n\n1\n\n123\n\n1\nFigure 8.1: Schubert's recursion for Gr(3, 7).\n\n8.2.3\n\nReduction to special case of Shapiro conjecture\n\nIn Section 8.1.2, we demonstrated that Theorem 1.9 is equivalent to Theorem 7.6 when all\nSchubert conditions are simple (each \u03b1i = ). In fact this case of Theorem 7.6 implies a\nweak form of the general case, in which we do not require transversality. The main idea is\nto use the limit (8.10), which we must first reinterpret. The flag F\u2022 is the osculating flag\nF\u2022 (t) when t = 0. In fact, the limit (8.10) still holds if we replace F\u2022 by F\u2022 (s) and 0 by s\n\n95\n\n\ffor any point s of P1 .

Then for any \u03b1 , . . . , \u03b1 with mp = i (mp \u2212 |\u03b1i |) and any\ndistinct s1 , . . . , sn \u2208 RP1 , the intersection\nn\n\\\n\ni=1\n\nX\u03b1i F\u2022 (si )\n\n(8.14)\n\nhas all points real.\nWe prove this by downward induction on the number n of Schubert conditions in (8.14),\nusing the limit (8.13) and the simple idea that a limit of a collection of real points is\nnecessarily a collection of real points.\nFirst, when n = mp each \u03b1i is simple and all points in the intersection (8.14) are real as\ni\nthat is our hypothesis in Theorem 8.7.

The\nequality of the two sides follows as the intersection on the right is zero-dimensional, and\ntherefore cannot contain any excess intersection. By induction, for general t \u2208 R, every\npoint in the left-hand intersection is real, and so every point in the limit is real. Theorem 8.7\nfollows as \u03b1n \u22d6 \u03b2 and so the intersection (8.14) is a subset of the right-hand side.\n\n8.3\n\nGrassmann duality\n\nIn Section 8.2 we showed how the Wronski formulation of the Shapiro Conjecture-mdimensional spaces of polynomials of degree m+p\u22121 whose Wronskian has distinct real\nroots-corresponds to an intersection of hypersurface Schubert varieties in Gr(p, m+p) defined by flags that osculate the rational normal curve at the roots of the Wronskian. The first\nformulation concerns points in Gr(m, m+p) while the second concerns points in Gr(p, m+p).\n96\n\n\fIn our proof of this correspondence we considered an m-dimensional space of polynomials\nas a space of linear forms on Cm+p , and associated this to the p-plane annihilated by the\nlinear forms. This gives a natural bijection\nGr(m, (Cm+p )\u2217 ) \u2212\u2192 Gr(p, Cm+p ) .\n\n(8.15)\n\nMoreover, the annihilators of the subspaces in a flag F\u2022 in Cm+p form the dual flag F\u2022\u2217 in\n(Cm+p )\u2217 . Under the identification of Grassmannians (8.15), the Schubert variety X\u03b1 F\u2022 of\nGr(p, Cm+p ) is identified with the Schubert variety X\u03b1\u2217 F\u2022\u2217 in Gr(m, (Cm+p )\u2217 ), where\nc\nc\n\u03b1\u2217 : m+p+1 \u2212 \u03b1m\n< m+p+1 \u2212 \u03b1m\u22121\n< * * * < m+p+1 \u2212 \u03b12c < m+p+1 \u2212 \u03b11c ,\n\nthat is, to obtain \u03b1\u2217 , first form the complement \u03b1c of \u03b1 in [m+p], then subtract each\ncomponent from m+p+1, and put the result in increasing order. This is an exercise in\ncombinatorial linear algebra, and the relation |\u03b1| = |\u03b1\u2217| is a combinatorial exercise.\nWrite Cm+p\u22121 [t] for the space of polynomials of degree at most m+p\u22121, which we identified as the dual space to Cm+p . We describe the Schubert subvarieties of Gr(m, Cm+p\u22121 [t])\nthat correspond to the Schubert varieties X\u03b1 F\u2022 (s).\nLet V \u2282 Cm+p\u22121 [t] be an m-dimensional space of polynomials. For any s \u2208 P1 , V has a\ndistinguished basis f1 , . . . , fm whose orders of vanishing at the point s are strictly increasing,\nords (f1 ) < ords (f2 ) < * * * < ords (fm ) .\nThis follows by Gaussian elimination applied to any basis f1 , . . . , fm of V . Suppose that\n0 \u2264 a1 is the minimal order of vanishing at s of some fi . Reordering the basis, we may\nassume that ords (f1 ) = a1 . Subtracting an appropriate multiple of f1 from the subsequent\nelements gives a new basis, still written f1 , . . . , fn , with a1 < ords (fi ) for i > 1. Suppose\nthat ords (f2 ) is minimal among the orders of vanishing at s of fi for i > 1 and now subtract\nappropriate multiples of f2 from the subsequent elements, and continue. The resulting\nsequence a := (a1 , . . . , am ) = (ords (f1 ), . . . , ords (fm )) is the ramification sequence of V at s.\nAn elementary calculation shows that if V has ramification sequence a at a point s \u2208 P1 ,\nthen the Wronskian of V vanishes at s to order\n|a| = a1 \u22120 + a2 \u22121 + * * * + am \u2212(m\u22121) .\nDefine a flag E\u2022 (s) \u2282 Cm+p\u22121 [t] where Ei (s) is the space of all polynomials that vanish\nto order at least m+p\u2212i at s. With these definitions, we have the following lemma.\nLemma 8.8 A space V of polynomials in Gr(m, Cm+p\u22121 [t]) has ramification sequence a at\ns if and only if\nV \u2208 Xar E\u2022 (s) ,\n\u0001\nr\nwhere a : m+p\u2212am < * * * < m+p\u2212ap \u2208 [m+p]\n.\nm\n\nA polynomial f (t) \u2208 Ei (s) if and only if (t \u2212 s)m+p\u2212i divides f , if and only if f (j) (s) = 0\nfor j = 0, 1, . . . , m+p\u22121\u2212i. If we view f as a linear form on Cm+p so that f (t) = f \u25e6 \u03b3(t),\nwe see that f (j) (t) = f \u25e6 \u03b3 (j) (t), and therefore f (t) \u2208 Ei (s) if and only if f annihilates the\nosculating subspace Fm+p\u2212i (s) to \u03b3 at \u03b3(s). Thus Ei (s)\u22a5 = Fm+p\u2212i (s), and so E\u2022 (s) is the\ndual flag to F\u2022 (s). In particular, the Schubert variety X\u03b1 F\u2022 (s) corresponds to X\u03b1\u2217 E\u2022 (s)\nunder Grassmann duality.\n97\n\n\fTheorem 8.9 The identification of Cm+p\u22121 [t] as the dual space to Cm+p induces an isomorphism of Grassmannians\nGr(m, (Cm+p )\u2217 ) \u2212\u2192 Gr(p, Cm+p ) .\nFor any s \u2208 P1 , this restricts to an isomorphism of the Schubert varieties,\nX\u03b1\u2217 E\u2022 (s) \u2212\u2192 X\u03b1 F\u2022 (s) .\n\n98\n\n\fChapter 9:\nThe Shapiro Conjecture for Rational\nFunctions\nWe continue our study of the Shapiro Conjecture, which asserts that if f1 (t), f2 (t), . . . , fm (t)\nare polynomials of degree m+p\u22121 whose Wronskian is \u03a6(t) has degree mp with distinct\nreal roots, then the linear span of f1 (t), f2 (t), . . . , fm (t) is real. We consider an apparently\ndegenerate case, that of rational functions, which is when m = 2.\nEremenko and Gabrielov [34] originally gave a proof of the Shapiro Conjecture when\nm = 2 using essentially the uniformization theorem from complex analysis. This proof\nwas also complicated and challenging for this reader. They subsequently found a second,\nsignificantly more elementary proof [32]. We will first discuss that proof, and then a generalization concerning rational functions that are constant on prescribed sets, which leads to\na generalization of the Shapiro Conjecture that we will discuss in Chapter 11.\n\n9.1\n\nThe Shapiro Conjecture for rational functions\n\nThe Shapiro conjecture for m = 2 asserts that if f1 (t) and f2 (t) are univariate polynomials\nwhose Wronskian\nWr (f1 , f2 ) = f1\u2032 (t)f2 (t) \u2212 f1 (t)f2\u2032 (t)\n(9.1)\nhas only real roots, then the complex linear span hf1 , f2 i is real in that there are real\npolynomials g1 and g2 with hf1 , f2 i = hg1 , g2 i.\nThis has a natural interpretation in terms of rational functions. The quotient of two\nunivariate polynomials f1 and f2 defines a rational function \u03c1 : P1 \u2192 P1 which on C \u2282 P1 is\n\u03c1 : t 7\u2212\u2192 f1 (t)/f2 (t) .\nSince\n\u03c1\u2032 (t) =\n\nf1\u2032 (t)f2 (t) \u2212 f1 (t)f2\u2032 (t)\nWr (f1 , f2 )\n=\n,\n2\nf2 (t)\nf2 (t)2\n\nif f1 and f2 are relatively prime, the critical points of \u03c1 in P1 are the roots of their Wronskian.\nTwo rational functions \u03c11 , \u03c12 : P1 \u2192 P1 are equivalent if they differ by a fractional linear\ntransformation on the target P1 . Since a fractional linear transformation on f1 /f2 is a change\nof basis in the linear span hf1 , f2 i, an equivalence class of rational functions is simply a twodimensional space of polynomials. An equivalence class is real if the corresponding linear\nspace is real. We state the theorem of Eremenko and Gabrielov.\nTheorem 9.1 (Shapiro's conjecture for rational functions [34, 32]) If a rational function \u03c1 : P1 \u2192 P1 has only real critical points, then \u03c1 is equivalent to a real rational function.\n99\n\n\fTheorem 8.2 and the Grassmann duality of Theorem 8.9 ensure the existence of a polynomial \u03a60 (t) \u2208 R2p [t] with only real roots such that \u0001every space of polynomials with Wronskian\n2p\n1\n\u03a60 (t) is real, and there are exactly #2,p = p+1\nsuch spaces of polynomials. The elemenp\ntary proof of Theorem 9.1 analytically continues these #2,p real spaces of polynomials as\nthe 2p distinct real roots of \u03a60 (t) vary. This continuation will produce fewer than #2,p real\nspaces of polynomials for any \u03a6(t) only if some of the spaces become complex during the\ncontinuation. But this can happen only if two spaces of polynomials first become equal\nduring the continuation.\nThe proof shows that such a collision cannot occur by associating discrete objects called\nnets, to the real rational functions that are distinct from each of the #2,p spaces of polynomials with Wronskian \u03a60 (t), and which are preserved under a continuation that varies the\nroots of \u03a60 (t). Thus no collisions are possible, which will imply Theorem 9.1.\n\n9.1.1\n\nContinuity and nets of rational functions\n\nA point p in the Grassmannian Gr(2, Cp+1 [t]) \u2243 Gr(2, p+2) is a two-dimensional space V of\nunivariate polynomials of degree at most p+1. Each such point gives an equivalence class of\nrational functions \u03c1 : P1 \u2192 P1 of degree p+1\u2212\u03b4, where \u03b4 is the maximum degree of a common\nfactor of the polynomials in V . Working with this equivalence is awkward, so we will instead\nuse the Stiefel manifold, Stp+1 , which is a GL(2, R)-fiber bundle over Gr(2, Cp+1 [t]).\nThe points of Stp+1 are pairs of nonproportional univariate polynomials of degree at\nmost p+1. Hence Stp+1 is an open subset of R2p+4 , with coordinates the coefficients of\nthe polynomials f and g. We give Stp+1 the subspace topology. The association Stp+1 \u220b\n(f, g) 7\u2212\u2192 f /g defines a map (written \u03c0) from Stp+1 to the space of rational functions. While\nthis map is not continuous as a map of spaces, it does have the weak continuity property\ngiven in Proposition 9.2 below.\nLet Z \u2282 Stp+1 be the locus of pairs (f, g) with either\ndeg gcf(f, g) > 0\n\nor\n\ndeg(f ) < d and deg(g) < p+1.\n\nThat is, f and g either have a common root in C or else a common root at \u221e, and thus\ndefine a rational function f /g of degree less than p+1.\nProposition 9.2 Let {\u03c6j | j \u2208 N} \u2282 Stp+1 \\ Z be a sequence of points that converges to\nsome point \u03c6 = (f, g) \u2208 Z. Let z1 , . . . , zk be the common roots of f and g (including \u221e if\ndeg(f ) and deg(g) are both less than d). Then the sequence of functions {\u03c0(\u03c6j ) | j \u2208 N}\nconverges to \u03c0(\u03c6) uniformly on compact subsets of P1 \\ {z1 , . . . , zk }.\nWe give an elementary proof of this proposition. Let K \u2282 P1 be a compact subset\ndisjoint from the common roots {z1 , . . . , zk } of f and g. We may cover P1 by the standard\naffine charts C0 and C\u221e whose coordinates are t and 1/t, respectively. Then K = K0 \u222a K\u221e ,\nwhere K0 \u2282 C0 and K\u221e \u2282 C\u221e are compact subsets of the two affine charts. It suffices to\nshow that the sequence of functions {\u03c0(\u03c6i )} converges uniformly to \u03c0(\u03c6) on each set K0\nand K\u221e .\nNow K0 is itself covered by compact sets K0f and K0g , where K0f contains no root of\nf and K0g contains no root of g. Removing finitely many members of the sequence {\u03c6i =\n100\n\n\f(fi , gi ) | i \u2208 N}, we may assume that no fi has a root in K0f and no gi has a root in K0g . As\n(fi , gi ) converges to (f, g) in Stp+1 , and no gi has a root in K0g , both sequences of functions\n{fi (t) | i \u2208 N}\n\nand\n\n{(gi (t))\u22121 | i \u2208 N}\n\nare uniformly bounded in K0g . Therefore, the sequence of functions\nfi (t)\n: K0g \u2212\u2192 C\ngi (t)\n\nis uniformly bounded and converges pointwise on the compact set K0g to f (t)/g(t). Thus\n\u223c\nthis convergence is uniform on K0g , and it remains uniform under C \u2212\u2192 C0 \u2282 P1 . The same\narguments work for K0f , as well as K\u221e , which proves the proposition.\nThis proposition is half of the engine of this proof of Eremenko and Gabrielov. The other\nhalf is the asymptotic proof of Shapiro's conjecture, Theorem 8.2.\nWe now explain how to associate an embedded graph with distinguished vertices to each\nreal rational function. Let Rp+1 be the set of nonconstant real rational functions of degree\nat most p+1, all of whose critical points are real. If \u03c1 \u2208 Rp+1 , then \u03c1\u22121 (RP1 ) \u2282 P1 defines\nan embedded (multi-) graph \u0393 with the following properties:\n(i) \u0393 is stable under complex conjugation and RP1 \u2282 \u0393.\n\nCall any edge in \u0393 \\ RP1 an interior edge.\n\n(ii) The vertices of \u0393 lie on RP1 and are the critical points of the rational function \u03c1. The\nvalence of a vertex is even and it equals twice the order of ramification of \u03c1 at the\ncritical point, which we call the local degree of \u0393 at the vertex.\n\nThe set-theoretic difference P1 \\\u0393 is a union of 2d cells, where d is the degree of \u03c1. The closure\nof each cell is homeomorphic to a disc, and the boundary of each cell maps homeomorphically\nto RP1 . This is because the cells (and their closures) are the inverse images of one of the\ntwo discs in P1 \\ RP1 (or their closures), and there are no critical points in the interior of\nany cell. We deduce the following additional property of these multi-graphs.\n(iii) No interior edge of \u0393 can begin and end at the same vertex.\nIndeed, if an interior edge e begins and ends at the same vertex, then r(e) = RP1 as v is the\nonly critical point on e. But then e must be the boundary of any cell adjacent to e, which\nimplies that \u0393 consists of only two cells and one edge e and so \u03c1 has degree 1, and in fact e\nwas not an interior edge after all.\nHere are three pictures of such embedded (multi-) graphs for quintic rational functions\nwith evenly spaced critical\u221apoints. We have drawn RP1 as a circle\n\u221a with the upper half plane\nin its interior. The point \u22121 is at the center of the circle, \u2212 \u22121 is the point at infinity,\nand complex conjugation is inversion in the circle.\n\n101\n\n\fWe seek to analytically continue rational functions whose Wronskians lie in a curve of\npolynomials {\u03a6z (t) | z \u2208 [0, 1]} where each \u03a6z (t) has degree 2p with distinct real roots\ns1 (z), s2 (z), . . . , s2p (z), and where each si is a continuous function of z. The vertices of the\ngraph \u03c1\u22121 (RP1 ) associated to a rational function \u03c1 with Wronskian \u03a6z (t) are labeled by\nthese roots, or equivalently by the numbers 1, 2, . . . , 2p. Since the relative order of these\nroots s1 (z), s2 (z), . . . , s2p (z) does not change as z varies (because each polynomial \u03a6z (t) has\ndistinct roots), we may capture this information by labeling only one root, say s1 (z) (which\nis a vertex of the corresponding graph), and assuming that the roots are ordered in a manner\nconsistent with a fixed orientation of RP1 . It is these labeled graphs that we wish to consider\nup to isotopy (deformation in P1 ).\nDefinition 9.3 A net is an (isotopy) equivalence class of such embedded multi-graphs in\nP1 satisfying (i), (ii), and (iii), with a distinguished vertex.\nHere are the five nets with 6 vertices, each with local degree 2 at every vertex. These\ncorrespond to rational functions of degree four with simple ramification.\n\n(9.2)\n\nThe uniform convergence of Proposition 9.2 implies a certain continuity of nets. Two\nsubsets X, Y \u2282 P1 have Hausdorff distance \u01eb if every point of X lies within a distance \u01eb of\nY and vice-versa. This gives the Hausdorff metric on subsets of P1 .\nProposition 9.4 Let {\u03c6j } \u2282 Stp+1 be a convergent sequence with limit \u03c6. Then the sets\n{\u03c0(\u03c6j )\u22121 (RP1 )} converge in the Hausdorff metric to the set {\u03c0(\u03c6)\u22121 (RP1 )}.\nWe deduce two corollaries from this proposition.\nCorollary 9.5 Suppose that {\u03c1z | z \u2208 [0, 1]} is a continuous path in R2p where each \u03c1z has\n2p critical points. Let v1 (z) be a continuous function of z which is equal to a critical point\nof \u03c1z , for each z. Then the net of the pair\n\u0001\n1\n\u03c1\u22121\nz (RP ), v1 (z)\ndoes not depend upon z.\n\nCorollary 9.6 Suppose that {\u03c6z | z \u2208 [0, 1]} is a continuous path in the Stiefel manifold\nSt2p . Suppose that for 0 < z we have \u03c0(\u03c6z ) \u2208 R2p and \u03c0(\u03c6z ) has distinct critical points\nv1 (z), v2 (z), . . . , vn (z), where vi (z) is a continuous function of z, and also that, at z = 0,\nwe have v1 (0) = v2 (0), but all other critical points are distinct. Then the degree of \u03c0(\u03c6z ) is\nconstant for z \u2208 (0, 1], and deg(\u03c0(\u03c60 )) < deg(\u03c0(\u03c61 )) if and only if the net of \u03c0(\u03c61 ) has an\ninterior edge between v1 (1) and v2 (1).\n102\n\n\fHere are two nets for quartic rational functions (9.2) as two of their vertices collide.\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nv2\n\n\u2212\u2192\nv2\n\nv1\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\n\u2212\u2192\nv2\n\nv1\n\nv1\n\nv1\n\nv2\n\nv1\n\nv1\n\nIn the first row, there is an edge (in fact two) of \u0393 \\ RP1 between the vertices v2 and v1 . This\nedge collapses in the limit as v2 approaches v1 , which causes two regions of P1 \\ \u0393 to collapse,\nso that the limiting net has two fewer regions in its complement, and thus corresponds to a\nrational function of degree 3. There is no such edge in the nets of the second row, and the\nlimiting net still has eight regions and thus its rational function still has degree four.\nProof of Corollary 9.6. The degree of a rational function \u03c1 \u2208 R2p is one-half the number of\ncells in the complement P1 \\ \u03c1\u22121 (RP1 ) of the net of \u03c1. Set \u03c1z := \u03c0(\u03c6z ). The only way for\nthe number of cells in the complement of the net of \u03c1z to change at some z0 \u2208 [0, 1] would\n1\n\u22121\n1\nbe if some edge of \u03c1\u22121\nz (RP ) collapsed as z \u2192 z0 . Since the vertices of \u03c1z (RP ) are the\ncritical points v1 (z), . . . , vn (z), which are distinct for z \u2208 (0, 1], we see that the degree of \u03c1z\nis constant for z \u2208 (0, 1].\nIf the degree of \u03c10 is less than that of \u03c11 , then some edges which bound a cell must\ndisappear in the limit as z \u2192 0. But this can only happen if a cell is bounded by edges\nbetween v1 (z) and v2 (z), as they are the only critical points which collide in the limit as\nz \u2192 0. By (iii), such a cell must be bounded by more than one edge which implies that\nthere was an interior edge between v1 (1) and v2 (1) outside of RP1 . This shows the necessity\nof such an interior edge between v1 (1) and v2 (1) for the degree to drop.\nFor sufficiency, note that if there is an interior edge between v1 (1) and v2 (1), then it\nmust collapse in the limit as z \u2192 0 for otherwise condition (iii) for nets would be violated.\n\n9.1.2\n\nSchubert induction for rational functions\n\nIn Chapter 8, we used Schubert induction to construct a sequence of points s1 , . . . , smp \u2208 R\nand sufficiently many real points in each Schubert variety X\u03b1 F\u2022 (0) which also lie in X F\u2022 (si )\nfor i = 1, . . . , |\u03b1|. Without re-running that proof, we will describe what that construction\ngives for rational functions.\nThe construction of Theorem 8.2 relevant for rational functions was in the Grassmannian\nGr(p, p+2). Under the Grassmann duality of Theorem 8.9, this becomes a construction\n103\n\n\f\u0001\nin Gr(2, Cp+1[t]) and involves a Schubert variety X\u03b1 E\u2022 (t) with \u03b1 \u2208 [p+2]\n. In fact, the\n2\nstatements become identical after replacing F\u2022 (t) by E\u2022 (t). We will briefly recall these\nstatements in this setting.\nA point in the Schubert cell X\u03b1\u25e6 E\u2022 (s) where \u03b1 : \u03b11 < \u03b12 is a two-dimensional subspace\nhf, gi of polynomials of degree p+1 such that\nords (f ) = p+2\u2212\u03b12\n\nand\n\nords (g) = p+2\u2212\u03b11 .\n\n(t \u2212 s)p+2\u2212\u03b12 ||f\n\nand\n\n(t \u2212 s)p+2\u2212\u03b11 ||g .\n\n(9.3)\n\nIn particular,\n(Here, ak ||b means that ak divides b, but ak+1 does not divide b.)\nGiven hf, gi \u2208 X\u03b1\u25e6 E\u2022 (s), a consequence of (9.3) is that\nWr (f, g) = f \u2032 (t)g(t) \u2212 f (t)g \u2032(t)\nvanishes to order p+1\u2212\u03b12 +p+2\u2212\u03b11 = 2p\u2212|\u03b1| at s.\nBy Lemma 8.4, there exist\nreal numbers s1 , . . . , s2p (in fact, we have s1 > * * * > s2p > 0)\n\u0001\n[p+2]\nsuch that for all \u03b1 \u2208 2 , the intersection\nX\u03b1 E\u2022 (0) \u2229\n\n|\u03b1|\n\\\n\ni=1\n\nX E\u2022 (si )\n\n(9.4)\n\nis transverse, and it consists of \u03b4(\u03b1) real points. Any point hf, gi in the intersection (9.4)\nwill have Wronskian\nf \u2032 (t)g(t) \u2212 f (t)g \u2032 (t) = constant * t2p\u2212|\u03b1| *\n\n|\u03b1|\nY\n(t \u2212 si )\ni=1\n\nIn fact, as noted in Remark 8.6, the proof of Lemma 8.4 did much more. Suppose that\n|\u03b1| > 0, and define\n\u03b2 1 := \u03b11 \u22121 < \u03b12\n\nand\n\n\u03b2 2 := \u03b11 < \u03b12 \u22121 ,\n\nwhen possible. (\u03b2 1 is only defined if 1 < \u03b11 and \u03b2 2 is only defined if \u03b11 +1 < \u03b12 ) Then the\nproof constructed \u03b4(\u03b1) = \u03b4(\u03b2 1 ) + \u03b4(\u03b2 2 ) families {hfz , gz i | z \u2208 [0, s|\u03b1| ]} of polynomials such\nthat\n1.

Exactly \u03b4(\u03b2 i ) of these families began in X\u03b2 i E\u2022 (0). That is, for \u03b4(\u03b2 i ) of these families,\nwe have (f0 , g0 ) \u2208 X\u03b2 i E\u2022 (0).\n104\n\n\f9.1.3\n\nSchubert induction for nets\n\nThe main idea in the proof is that the rational functions constructed in Lemma 8.4 each\nhave different nets.\nTheorem 9.7 The \u03b4(\u03b1) rational functions in X\u03b1\u25e6 E\u2022 (0) constructed in Lemma 8.4 each have\ndifferent nets.\nSuppose that hf, gi is a point in the intersection (9.4) where f and g satisfy (9.3) for\ns = 0. Then its Wronskian vanishes to order 2p\u2212|\u03b1| at 0 and to order 1 at the points\ns1 , . . . , s|\u03b1| . In particular, 0 is the only common zero of f and g. Removing the common\nfactor tp+2\u2212\u03b12 from both f and g gives relatively prime polynomials of degree at most \u03b12 \u22121.\nIndeed, if f and g had a common root s, then a linear combination of them would vanish\nto order at least 2 and so their Wronskian would vanish to order at least 2 at s. Then the\nrational function r := f /g has degree \u03b12 \u22121 with Wronskian\n\u03b12 \u2212\u03b11 \u22121\n\nconstant * t\n\n|\u03b1|\nY\n* (t \u2212 si ) .\ni=1\n\nThe point hf, gi corresponds to a unique path in the Bruhat order from 12 to \u03b1 in the\nBruhat order. We claim that this path may be recovered from the net \u03c1\u22121 (RP1 ) of \u03c1.\nIndeed, consider the ith step in the construction, when the critical point si was created.\nBy Corollary 9.6, the interior edge from si has other endpoint 0 if the degree of the rational\nfunction increased at the ith step, and if its degree did not increase, then the other endpoint\nof that edge is at some critical point sk with sk > si and so k < i. Subsequent steps in the\nconstruction will not affect an edge from si to sk with k < i, but an edge between 0 and si\nmay be moved to an edge between si and sj where j > i.\nThus, the degree of the rational function increased at step i if and only if the other\nendpoint of an interior edge from si is at sj with j > i. If \u03b2 \u22d6 \u03b2 \u2032 is the ith step in the chain\ncorresponding to our rational function \u03c1, then\n1. \u03b22 + 1 = \u03b22\u2032 , so the degree of the rational function increased, if the interior edge from\nsi has endpoint sj with j > i (so sj < si ), and\n2. \u03b21 + 1 = \u03b21\u2032 , so the degree of the rational function did not increase, if the interior edge\nfrom si has endpoint sk with k < i (so sk > si ).\nThis completes the proof.\nFigure 9.1 illustrates the formation of the nets during the Schubert induction for quartic\nrational functions, as well as the recursion for \u03b4(\u03b1).\nWe complete the proof of the Shapiro conjecture for rational curves.\nTheorem 9.8 Let \u03a6(t) be a real polynomial of degree 2p whose roots are all real.

Each point in the intersection is an equivalence class of\nrational functions with Wronskian\n2p\nY\n(t \u2212 si ) .\n\u03a60 (t) =\ni=1\n\nLet {\u03a6z | z \u2208 [0, 1]} be a continuous family of polynomials of degree 2p all with distinct\nreal roots and with \u03a61 (t) = \u03a6(t). We attempt to analytically continue each point in the\nfiber Wr \u22121 (\u03a6z ) from z = 0 to z = 1. The only way this continuation could fail would be if\nit encountered a fiber Wr \u22121 (\u03a6z ) with a multiple point. Then two of the rational functions\nin this fiber would have to coincide. In particular two would have the same net, (where we\nhave labeled the nets by the root of the \u03a6z (t) corresponding to s1 ). This implies that two\nof the original rational functions in Wr \u22121 (\u03a60 ) have the same net, by Corollary 9.5. But this\ncontradicts Theorem 9.7.\n\n9.2\n\nRational functions with prescribed coincidences\n\nThe results of Section 9.1 can be used to prove a result about real rational functions that\nsatisfy a certain interpolation condition. This is is due to Eremenko, Gabrielov, Shapiro,\nand Vainstein [35], and may be interpreted in the Grassmannian Gr(p, p+2) as an appealing\ngeneralization of the Shapiro conjecture. We will discuss this generalization, the Secant\nConjecture, in Chapter 11.\nWe first describe the interpolation problem. Let A1 , . . . , An be disjoint finite subsets of\n1\nP where the set Ai has 1 + ai elements with 1 \u2264 ai \u2264 p and a1 + * * * + an = 2p. Write\na for this sequence (a1 , . . . , an ) of numbers. The interpolation problem is to determine the\nequivalence classes of rational functions \u03c1 of degree p+1 that satisfy\n\u03c1|Ai is constant for i = 1, . . . , n .\nThere are in fact finitely many such equivalence classes of rational functions when the sets\nAi are general. We will later prove this finiteness and show the number of equivalence classes\nis a Kostka number Ka [38, p.25],[76, I,6]. Heuristically, there are finitely many equivalence\nclasses because the condition that a rational function is constant on a finite set of 1+a\nelements gives a equations in the Stiefel coordinates for rational functions.\nA collection of sets Ai \u2282 RP1 for i = 1, . . . , n is separated if there exist disjoint intervals\nI1 , . . . , In of RP1 with Ai \u2282 Ii for i = 1, . . . , n.\n\nTheorem 9.9 ([35]) Let a = (a1 , . . . , an ) with 1 \u2264 ai \u2264 p and a1 + * * * + ab = 2p. For\ngeneral separated subsets of RP1 , A1 , . . . , An with |A1 | = 1+ai , there are exactly Ka real\nequivalence classes of rational functions \u03c1 such that\n\u03c1|Ai is constant for i = 1, . . . , n .\n107\n\n(9.5)\n\n\fGiven separated subsets A1 , . . . , An of RP1 , the proof first constructs such a real rational\nfunction satisfying (9.5) for every net with a certain property, described below (9.6). Next,\nit relates this interpolation problem to a problem in the Schubert calculus that has Ka\nsolutions, and finally shows that Ka is the number of nets with the property (9.6). This will\nimply that we have constructed all the solutions for general sets Ai .\nTheorem 9.9 generalizes Theorem 9.1. Suppose that we have subsets {Az | z \u2208 (0, 1]} of\nRP1 depending continuously on z, each of cardinality a + 1, whose limit as z \u2192 0 consists\nof a single point,\nlim Az = {s} .\nz\u21920\n\nSuppose further that we have a family {\u03c1z | z \u2208 [0, 1]} of rational functions that depends\ncontinuously on z, and such that for z > 0, \u03c1z is constant on A. Then \u03c10 will have a critical\npoint at s of order at least a.\nIn this way, Theorem 9.9 implies Theorem 9.1 by simply considering the limit as the\npoints in each set Ai collide. In fact, this analysis will enable us to deduce a stronger form\nof Theorem 9.1\nTheorem 9.10 Let a1 , . . . , an be positive integers with 1 \u2264 ai \u2264 p and a1 + * * * + an = 2p.\nThen every rational function of degree p + 1 with n real critical points of multiplicities\na1 , . . . , an is real. There are exactly Ka classes of such rational functions, and the corresponding Schubert varieties meet transversally.\n\n9.2.1\n\nProof of Theorems 9.9 and 9.10\n\nLet Rp+1 be the set of rational function of degree p+1 with exactly 2p critical points of\nmultiplicity 1. We use two consequences of the work in Section 9.1.\n1. If \u03c11 and \u03c12 are rational functions in Rp+1 with the same critical points and isotopic\nnets (where we use the same critical point for each net), then \u03c11 is equivalent to \u03c12 .\n2. For every net \u0393 \u2282 P1 with a given vertex set V (and distinguished vertex v1 \u2208 V ),\nthere is a unique equivalence class of rational functions in Rp+1 with critical set V and\nnet (with distinguished vertex v1 ) isotopic to \u0393.\nActually, we only showed the second point for nets with local degree 2 at each critical\npoint. The stronger statement follows from results in [34]. To prove Theorem 9.9, fix\nseparated subsets A1 , . . . , An of RP1 satisfying the hypotheses. Choose 2p additional points\ns1 , . . . , s2p where, for each i, ai of the points interlace the ai +1 points of Ai . Figure 9.2\nshows an example when p = 5 and a = (3, 2, 2, 2, 1). Each point sj lies between two points\nof some set Ai . Write [xj , yj ] for the interval that contains sj and note that xj , yj \u2208 Ai , for\nsome i.\nConsider nets with the vertices s1 , . . . , s2p that have local degree 2 at each vertex and\nsatisfy the additional hypothesis:\nThere are no edges between points sj and sk that interlace the same set Ai\n108\n\n(9.6)\n\n\fA2\n\nA3\n\nA4\n\nA1\n\ns1 , . . . , s10\n\nA5\nFigure 9.2: Interlacing points.\nThere are five nets satisfying (9.6) for the points Ai of Figure 9.2 (we only draw the edges\nin the upper half plane, which is the interior of the circle).\n\n(9.7)\n\nSuppose that we have critical points s1 , . . . , s2p interlacing the sets Ai , where all the\npoints si are fixed and chosen arbitrarily within their intervals, except for one, sj , which is\nallowed to vary within its interval [xj , yj ]. Also fix an isotopy class \u0393 of nets satisfying (9.6).\nFor each s \u2208 [xj , yj ] let \u03c1s \u2208 Rp+1 be a rational function with the critical points s1 , . . . , s2p\nand net \u0393. We may suppose that {\u03c1s | s \u2208 [xj , yj ]} is a continuous family.\nLemma 9.11 There exists a point sj \u2208 [xj , yj ] such that \u03c1sj (xj ) = \u03c1sj (yj ).\nTo see this, we may assume that \u03c1s is normalized so that \u03c1s (s) = 0 and \u03c1s maps the\ninterior edge of \u0393 terminating in sj to the interval [\u2212\u221e, 0] in RP1 . Then the difference\n\u03c1s (xj ) \u2212 \u03c1s (yj )\nis positive when s is near yj and negative when s is near xj , so it changes sign on the interval\n[xj , yj ] and therefore takes the value zero at some sj \u2208 [xj , yj ]. We give a picture below.\nThe arrows point in the direction of increase of \u03c1s (t) for t in the net.\nyj\n\nyj\n\ns\n\nyj\ns\n\nxj\n\u03c1s (xj ) \u2212 \u03c1s (yj ) > 0\n\nxj\n\n109\n\nxj s\n\u03c1s (xj ) \u2212 \u03c1s (yj ) < 0\n\n\fLemma 9.12 If \u0393 is a net satisfying (9.6), then there is a choice of critical points s1 , . . . , s2p\ninterlacing the points of the sets Ai such that every rational function \u03c1 of degree p+1 with\nthe net \u0393 and critical points sj satisfies\n\u03c1|Ai is constant for i = 1, . . . , n .\n\n(9.8)\n\nThe set of possible critical points s = (s1 , . . . , s2p ) \u2208 (RP1 )2p interlacing the sets Ai forms\nthe interior of a closed cube\nQ := [x1 , y1] \u00d7 [x2 , y2 ] \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 [x2p , y2p ] .\nBy Lemma 9.11, for every j, the function \u03c6j (s) := \u03c1s (xj ) \u2212 \u03c1s (yj ) (defined as described in\nthe proof of Lemma 9.11) is positive on the face sj = yj and negative on the face sj = xj .\nThis implies (via variant of Brower's fixed point theorem) that there is a point s in the\ninterior of Q where \u03c6j (s) = 0 for all j, that is \u03c1s (xj ) = \u03c1s (yj ) for all j. Since these intervals\ninterlace the sets Ai , this implies (9.8).\nThe next step is to show that the number of nets satisfying (9.6) for sets A1 , . . . , An\nwhere Ai has 1+ai members and a1 + * * * + an = 2p is the Kostka number Ka . This Kostka\nnumber is the number of Young tableaux of shape 2 \u00d7 p and content a [39, p.25]. These\nare arrays consisting of two rows of integers, each of length p such that the integers increase\nweakly across each row and strictly down each column. For example, here are the five Young\ntableaux of shape 2 \u00d7 p and content (3, 2, 2, 2, 1), showing that K(3,2,2,2,1) = 5.\n1 1 1 2 2\n3 3 4 4 5\n\n1 1 1 3 4\n2 2 3 4 5\n\n1 1 1 3 3\n2 2 4 4 5\n\n1 1 1 2 4\n2 3 3 4 5\n\n1 1 1 2 3\n2 3 4 4 5\n\n(9.9)\n\nWe only describe the map from nets to Young tableaux. Given a net satisfying (9.6),\nwe will successively place integers into a left-justified two-rowed array while traversing RP1 .\nThis starts from the first (in the canonical ordering on RP1 ) point in A1 and begins with an\nempty array. When a critical point sj is encountered, there will be an interior edge of the\nnet with endpoint sj . Place the integer j in the second row if the other endpoint of that\nedge has already been encountered, and in the first row if it has not been encountered. For\nexample, the tableaux in (9.9) correspond, in order, to the nets in (9.7). (There, the order\non RP1 is counterclockwise on the circles.)\nThis bijection shows that we have constructed Ka equivalence classes of rational functions\nsatisfying (9.5). To complete the proof of Theorem 9.9, we first show that the Kostka number\nKa is the expected number of equivalence classes of rational functions satisfying (9.5), and\nthen that there is some choice of the sets Ai for which there are exactly Ka equivalence\nclasses of rational functions. This last step will also prove Theorem 9.10.\nRecall that a polynomial f of degree p+1 may be considered to be a linear map on\nCp+2 so that the composition with the rational normal curve \u03b3(t) : C \u2192 Cp+2 gives the\npolynomial f (t). We used this to relate ramification to osculating flags as in Section 8.3. A\ntwo-dimensional space hf, gi of polynomials gives a map\n(f,g)\n\n\u03b3(t)\n\nC \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Cp+2 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 C2 .\n110\n\n\f(f,g)\n\nThe kernel H of the map Cp+2 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 C2 corresponds to hf, gi under Grassmann duality.\nSuppose that the rational function \u03c1 = f /g is constant on some finite subset, A. This\nmeans that the line (f (a), g(a)) \u2282 C2 is constant, for a \u2208 A. This implies that in Cp+2 we\nhave\nhH, \u03b3(a)i = hH, \u03b3(b)i ,\n\nfor any a, b \u2208 A. In particular, H has exceptional position with respect to the |A|-plane\nS(A) := h\u03b3(a) | a \u2208 Ai in that the two subspaces do not span Cp+2 .\nThus, the equivalence classes of rational functions \u03c1 of degree p + 1 that satisfy (9.8)\ncorrespond to the p-planes H in Cp+2 such that\nspan(H, S(Ai )) 6= Cp+2\n\nfor i = 1, . . . , n .\n\n(9.10)\n\nThose H which satisfy (9.10) are the points\n\u0001 of an intersection of Schubert varieties. Let\n[p+2]\n\u03c3a := (2, 3, . . . , a+1, a+3, . . . , p+2) \u2208 p . Then X\u03c3a F\u2022 consists of those H \u2208 Gr(p, p+2)\nsuch that\nspan(H, Fa+1 ) 6= Cp+2 .\nWe will also write X\u03c3a Fa+1 for this Schubert variety, which has dimension |\u03c3a | = 2p\u2212a. Thus\nthe solutions to the interpolation problem (9.8) correspond to the intersection of Schubert\nvarieties\nX\u03c3a1 S(A1 ) \u2229 X\u03c3a2 S(A2 ) \u2229 * * * \u2229 X\u03c3an S(An ) ,\n\nwhich is expected to be zero dimensional. These are special Schubert varieties, so the\nexpected number of points in this intersection may be computed using the Pieri formula,\nand it is the Kostka number Ka [39, p.25].\nAll that remains to show is that there is some choice of the sets Ai for which there\nare finitely many equivalence classes of rational functions satisfying the interpolation condition (9.8). We show that indirectly, by passing to the limit as each set Ai collapses to a\nsingle point, si . If we consider the rational functions for a given net in this limit, we see\nthat the limiting rational function still has degree p+1, by Corollary 9.6 as no interior edges\nwere collapsed in the limit, by Condition (9.6). The limiting rational function has a critical\npoint at each si of multiplicity ai , and is necessarily real.\nIt is easy to see that there are still Ka nets that have critical points of multiplicity ai at\npoints si -the same bijection works. For example, here are the nets of rational functions of\ndegree five with critical points having multiplicities (3, 2, 2, 2, 1).\n\nMoreover, the corresponding intersection of Schubert varieties is expected to have Ka points.\nThus we have constructed the expected number of real rational functions with the desired\ncritical points. The proof of Theorem 9.10 now follows from the results of [34], which gave\na bijective correspondence between nets and rational functions.\n111\n\n\fChapter 10:\nProof of the Shapiro conjecture\nThe Shapiro Conjecture was proven by Mukhin, Tarasov, and Varchenko in a preprint\nof November 2005 [81]. Like the proofs of the special case of m = 2 by Eremenko and\nGabrielov [34, 32] (discussed in Chapter 9) the proof in the general case did not use much\nalgebraic geometry. Instead it used results in mathematical physics, specifically integrable\nsystems, with some representation theory. Unlike the rest of the material in this book, this\nchapter is not elementary. It does contain a sketch of some of the main ideas in their proof,\nbut it by no means complete, and we recommend that the serious reader go to the original\nsources. An expanded account of the Shapiro conjecture and its proof appeared in the Bulletin of the AMS [115]. In fact, what follows is a mildly revised version of Sections 2, 3, and\n4 of [115].\n\n10.1\n\nSpaces of polynomials with given Wronskian\n\nBy Theorem 8.7, the general case of the Shapiro conjecture follows from the special case\nwhen all the Schubert conditions are equal to , and this case is equivalent to the Wronski formulation of Theorem 1.9. A further reduction is possible, as the Wronski map\nWr : Gr(m, m+p) \u2192 Pmp is a finite map in that it has finite fibers, a standard limiting\nargument (given, for example, in Section 1.3 of [81] or Remark 3.4 of [111]) shows that it\nsuffices to prove Theorem 1.9 when the Wronskian has distinct real roots that are sufficiently\ngeneral. Since #m,p is the upper bound for the number of spaces of polynomials with a given\nWronskian, it suffices to construct this number of distinct spaces of real polynomials with a\ngiven Wronskian, when the Wronskian has distinct real roots that are sufficiently general.\nIn fact, this is exactly what Mukhin, Tarasov, and Varchenko do [81].\nTheorem 1.9\u2032 . If s1 , . . . , smp are generic realQnumbers, there are #m,p real spaces of polynomials in Gr(m, Cm+p\u22121 [t]) with Wronskian mp\ni=1 (t \u2212 si ).\n\nThe proof first constructs #m,p distinct spaces of polynomials with a given Wronskian\nhaving generic complex roots, which we describe in Section 10.1.1. This uses a Fuchsian\ndifferential equation given by the critical points of a remarkable symmetric function, called\nthe master function. The next step uses the Bethe ansatz in a certain representation V of\nslm C: each critical point of the master function gives a Bethe eigenvector of the Gaudin\nHamiltonians which turns out to be a highest weight vector for an irreducible submodule of\nV . This is described in Section 10.2, where the eigenvalues of the Gaudin Hamiltonians on a\nBethe vector are shown to be the coefficients of the Fuchsian differential equation giving the\ncorresponding spaces of polynomials. This is the germ of the new, deep connection between\nrepresentation theory and Schubert calculus that led to the full statement of Theorem 7.6\n(reality and transversality). Finally, the Gaudin Hamiltonians are real symmetric operators\n112\n\n\fCritical points of the master function\n@\nBethe\n@\n@ ansatz\n@\n@\n@\nR\n@\n\nFuchsian\ndifferential\nequations\n!\n\nWr \u22121 (yn (t)) \u001b\n\nIntegrable systems and\nRepresentation theory\n\n-\n\n6\n\nEigenvalues of a\nsymmetric matrix\n(forces reality)\n\nReal spaces\nof polynomials\n\u0001 \u001b\n\u22121\nWr (yn (t))\n\nFigure 10.1: Schematic of proof of Shapiro conjecture.\n\nwhen the Wronskian has only real roots, so their eigenvalues are real, and thus the Fuchsian\ndifferential equation has real coefficients and the corresponding space of polynomials is also\nreal.

The Cartan matrix for slm appears\n(i)\n(j)\nin the exponents of the factors (x\u2217 \u2212x\u2217 ) in (10.1). This hints at the relation of these master\nfunctions to Lie theory, which we do not discuss.\n\n113\n\n\fThe critical points of the master function are solutions to the system of equations\n1 \u2202\n\u039e(x; s) = 0\n\u039e \u2202x(i)\nj\n\nfor i = 1, . . . , m\u22121,\n\nj = 1, . . . , ip .\n\n(10.2)\n\nWhen the parameters s are generic, these Bethe ansatz equations turn out to have finitely\nmany solutions. The master function is invariant under the group\nS := Sp \u00d7 S2p \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 S(m\u22121)p ,\nwhere SN is the group of permutations of {1, . . . , N}, and the factor Sip permutes the\nvariables in x(i) . Thus S acts on the critical points. The invariants of this action are\npolynomials whose roots are the coordinates of the critical points.\nGiven a critical point x, define monic polynomials gx := (g1 , . . . , gm\u22121 ) where the components x(i) of x are the roots of gi ,\nip\nY\n(i)\n(t \u2212 xj )\ngi :=\n\nfor i = 1, . . . , m\u22121 .\n\n(10.3)\n\nj=1\n\nAlso write gm for the Wronskian, the monic polynomial with roots s.

The discriminant Discr(f ) of a polynomial f is the\nsquare of the product of differences of its roots and the resultant Res(f, h) is the product of\nall differences of the roots of f and h [22].

The following result is due to Scherbak and\nVarchenko [96] for m = 2 and to Mukhin and Varchenko [83, \u00a75] for all m.\nTheorem 10.2 Suppose that Vx is the fundamental space of a critical point x of the master\nfunction \u039e with generic parameters s which are the roots of \u03a6.\n1. Then Vx \u2208 Gr(m, Cm+p\u22121 [t]) has Wronskian \u03a6.\n2. The critical point x is recovered from Vx in some cases as follows. Suppose that\nf1 , . . . , fm are monic polynomials in Vx with deg fi = p\u22121+i, each fi is square-free,\nand that the pairs fi and fi+1 are relatively prime. Then, up to scalar multiples, the\npolynomials g1 , . . . , gm\u22121 in the sequence gx are\nf1 , Wr (f1 , f2 ) , Wr (f1 , f2 , f3 ) , . . . , Wr (f1 , . . . , fm ) .\nStatement (2) includes a general result about factoring a linear differential operator into\ndifferential operators of degree 1.

This follows from some interesting identities among\nWronskians shown in the Appendix of [83].\nTheorem 10.2 is deeper than this curious fact. When the polynomials g1 , . . . , gm and\n\u03a6 are square-free, consecutive pairs are relatively prime, and s is generic, it implies that\nthe kernel V of an operator of the form (10.5) is a space of polynomials with Wronskian \u03a6\nhaving roots s if and only if the polynomials g1 , . . . , gm come from the critical points of the\nmaster function (10.1) corresponding to \u03a6.\nThis gives an injection from S-orbits of critical points of the master function \u039e with\nparameters s to spaces of polynomials whose Wronskian has roots s. Mukhin and Varchenko\nshowed that this is a bijection when s is generic.\nTheorem 10.3 (Theorem 6.1 in [84]) For generic complex numbers s, the master function \u039e has nondegenerate critical points that form #m,p distinct orbits.\n\n115\n\n\fThe structure (but not of course the details) of their proof is remarkably similar to the\nstructure of the proof of Theorem 8.2; they allow the parameters to collide one-by-one, and\nstudy how the orbits of critical points behave. Ultimately, they obtain the same recursion\nas in (8.12), which mimics the Pieri formula for the branching rule for tensor products of\nrepresentations of slm with its last fundamental representation V\u03c9m\u22121 . This same structure is\nalso found in the main argument in [33]. In fact, this is the same recursion in \u03b1 that Schubert\nestablished for intersection numbers \u03b4(\u03b1), and then solved to obtain the formula (1.4) in [98].\n\n10.2\n\nThe Bethe ansatz for the Gaudin model\n\nThe Bethe ansatz is a general (conjectural) method to find pure states, called Bethe vectors, of quantum integrable systems. The (periodic) Gaudin model is an integrable system\nconsisting of a family of commuting operators called the Gaudin Hamiltonians that act on\na representation V of slm C. In this Bethe ansatz, a vector-valued rational function is constructed so that for certain values of the parameters it yields a complete set of Bethe vectors.\nAs the Gaudin Hamiltonians commute with the action of slm C, the Bethe vectors turn out\nto be highest weight vectors generating irreducible submodules of V , and so this also gives a\nmethod for decomposing some representations V of slm C into irreducible submodules. The\ndevelopment, justification, and refinements of this Bethe ansatz are the subject of a large\nbody of work, a small part of which we mention.\n\n10.2.1\n\nRepresentations of slm C\n\nThe Lie algebra slm C (or simply slm ) is the space of m \u00d7 m-matrices with trace zero. It has\na decomposition\nslm = n\u2212 \u2295 h \u2295 n+ ,\n\nwhere n+ (n\u2212 ) are the strictly upper (lower) triangular matrices, and h consists of the\ndiagonal matrices with zero trace. The universal enveloping algebra Uslm of slm is the\nassociative algebra generated by slm subject to the relations uv \u2212 vu = [u, v] for u, v \u2208 slm ,\nwhere [u, v] is the Lie bracket in slm .\nWe consider only finite-dimensional representations of slm (equivalently, of Uslm ). For\na more complete treatment, see [42]. Any representation V of slm decomposes into joint\neigenspaces of h, called weight spaces,\nM\nV [\u03bc] ,\nV =\n\u03bc\u2208h\u2217\n\nwhere, for v \u2208 V [\u03bc] and h \u2208 h, we have h.v = \u03bc(h)v. The possible weights \u03bc of representations lie in the integral weight lattice. This has a distinguished basis of fundamental weights\n\u03c91 , . . . , \u03c9m\u22121 that generate the cone of dominant weights.\nAn irreducible representation V has a unique one-dimensional weight space that is annihilated by the nilpotent subalgebra n+ of slm . The associated weight \u03bc is dominant, and\nit is called the highest weight of V . Any nonzero vector with this weight is a highest weight\nvector of V , and it generates V . Furthermore, any two irreducible modules with the same\n116\n\n\fhighest weight are isomorphic. Write V\u03bc for the highest weight module with highest weight\n\u03bc. Lastly, there is one highest weight module for each dominant weight.\nMore generally, if V is any representation of slm and \u03bc is a weight, then the singular\nvectors in V of weight \u03bc, written sing(V [\u03bc]), are the vectors in V [\u03bc] annihilated by n+ .\nIf v \u2208 sing(V [\u03bc]) is nonzero, then the submodule Uslm .v it generates is isomorphic to the\nhighest weight module V\u03bc . Thus V decomposes as a direct sum of submodules generated by\nthe singular vectors,\nM\nV =\nUslm .sing(V [\u03bc]) ,\n(10.6)\n\u03bc\n\nso that the multiplicity of the highest weight module V\u03bc in V is simply the dimension of its\nspace of singular vectors of weight \u03bc.\nWhen V is a tensor product of highest weight modules, the Littlewood-Richardson\nrule [39] gives formulas for the dimensions of the spaces of singular vectors. Since this\nis the same rule for the number of points in an intersection (7.1) of Schubert varieties from\na Schubert problem, these geometric intersection numbers are equal to the dimensions of\nm\nspaces of singular\nVm\u22121vectors. In\u2217 particular, if V\u03c91 \u2243 C is the defining representation of slm\nand V\u03c9m\u22121 =\nV\u03c91 = V\u03c91 (these are the first and last fundamental representations of\nslm ), then\n[0]) = #m,p .\n(10.7)\ndim sing(V\u03c9\u2297mp\nn\n\nIt is important to note that this equality of numbers is purely formal, in that the same\nformula governs both numbers. A direct connection remains to be found.\n\n10.2.2\n\nThe (periodic) Gaudin model\n\nThe Bethe ansatz is a conjectural method to obtain a complete set of eigenvectors for the\nintegrable system on V := V\u03c9\u2297n\ngiven by the Gaudin Hamiltonians (defined below). Since\nm\u22121\nthese Gaudin Hamiltonians commute with slm , the Bethe ansatz has the additional benefit\nof giving an explicit basis for sing(V [\u03bc]), thus explicitly giving the decomposition (10.6).\nThe Gaudin Hamiltonians act on V\u03c9\u2297n\nand depend upon n distinct complex numbers\nm\u22121\ns1 , . . . , sn and a complex variable t. Let glm be the Lie algebra of m \u00d7 m complex matrices.\nFor each i, j = 1, . . . , m, let Ei,j \u2208 glm be the matrix whose only nonzero entry is a 1 in\nrow i and column j. For each pair (i, j) consider the differential operator Xi,j (t) acting on\nV\u03c9\u2297n\n-valued functions of t,\nm\u22121\n(k)\nn\nX\nEj,i\nd\n\u2212\n,\nXi,j (t) := \u03b4i,j\ndt\nt \u2212 sk\nk=1\n(k)\n\nwhere Ej,i acts on tensors in V\u03c9\u2297n\nby Ej,i in the kth factor and by the identity in other\nm\u22121\n-valued functions of t,\nfactors. Define a differential operator acting on V\u03c9\u2297n\nm\u22121\nM :=\n\nX\n\u03c3\u2208S\n\nsgn(\u03c3) X1,\u03c3(1) (t) X2,\u03c3(2) (t) * * * Xm,\u03c3(m) (t) ,\n\n117\n\n\fwhere S is the group of permutations of {1, . . . , m} and sgn(\u03c3) = \u00b1 is the sign of a permutation \u03c3 \u2208 S. Write M in standard form\nM =\n\ndm\u22121\ndm\n+\nM\n(t)\n+ * * * + Mm (t) .\n1\ndtm\ndtm\u22121\n\nThese coefficients M1 (t), . . . , Mm (t) are called the (higher) Gaudin Hamiltonians. They are\nlinear operators that depend rationally on t and act on V\u03c9\u2297n\n. We collect together some of\nm\u22121\ntheir properties.\nTheorem 10.4 Suppose that s1 , . . . , sn are distinct complex numbers. Then\n1. The Gaudin Hamiltonians commute, that is, [Mi (u), Mj (v)] = 0 for all i, j = 1, . . . , m\nand u, v \u2208 C.\n2. The Gaudin Hamiltonians commute with the action of slm on V\u03c9\u2297n\n.\nm\u22121\nProofs are given in [70], as well as Propositions 7.2 and 8.3 in [80], and are based on\nresults of Talalaev [125]. A consequence of the second assertion is that the Gaudin Hamiltonians preserve the weight space decomposition of the singular vectors of V\u03c9\u2297n\n. Since they\nm\u22121\n\u2297n\ncommute, the singular vectors of V\u03c9m\u22121 have a basis of common eigenvectors of the Gaudin\nHamiltonians. The Bethe ansatz is a method to write down joint eigenvectors and their\neigenvalues.\n\n10.2.3\n\nThe Bethe ansatz for the Gaudin model\n\nThis begins with a rational function that takes values in a weight space V\u03c9\u2297n\n[\u03bc],\nm\u22121\nv : Cl \u00d7 Cn 7\u2212\u2192 V\u03c9\u2297n\n[\u03bc] .\nm\u22121\nThis universal weight function was introduced in [95] to solve the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov\nequations with values in V\u03c9\u2297n\n[\u03bc]. When (x, s) is a critical point of a master function, the\nm\u22121\nvector v(x, s) is both singular and an eigenvector of the Gaudin Hamiltonians. (This master\nfunction is a generalization of the one defined by (10.1).) The Bethe ansatz conjecture for\nthe periodic Gaudin model asserts that the vectors v(x, s) form a basis for the space of\nsingular vectors.\n\u2297n\ngenerates V\u03c9\u2297n\nas a Uslm \u2297n Fix a highest weight vector vm \u2208 V\u03c9m\u22121 [\u03c9m\u22121 ]. Then vm\nm\u22121\n\u2297n\nmodule. In particular, any vector in V\u03c9m\u22121 is a linear combination of vectors that are obtained\n(k)\n\n\u2297n\nfrom vm\nby applying a sequence of operators Ei+1,i , for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n and 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m\u22121. The\nuniversal weight function is\u0001 a linear combination of such vectors of weight \u03bc.\nWhen n = mp, l = p m2 , and \u03bc = 0, the universal weight function is a map\n\n[0] .\nv : Cp( 2 ) \u00d7 Cmp \u2212\u2192 V\u03c9\u2297mp\nm\u22121\nm\n\nTo describe it, note that a vector Ea+1,a Eb+1,b * * * Ec+1,c .vn+1 is nonzero only if\n(a, b, . . . , c) = (a, a+1, . . . , m\u22122, m\u22121) .\n118\n\n\fWrite va for this vector. The vectors v1 , . . . , vm form a basis of V\u03c9m\u22121 . Thus only some\n(k)\n\u2297mp\nsequences of operators Ei+1,i applied to vm\ngive a nonzero vector. These sequences are\n(k)\ncompletely determined once we know the weight of the result. The operator Ei+1,i lowers\nthe weight of a weight vector by the root \u03b1i .

The reason for this reality is that the eigenvectors\nand eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix are real.\nWe begin with the Shapovalov form. The map \u03c4 : Ei,j 7\u2192 Ej,i induces an antiautomorphism on slm . Given a highest weight module V\u03bc , and a highest weight vector v \u2208 V\u03bc [\u03bc] the\nShapovalov form h*, *i on V\u03bc is defined recursively by\nhv, vi = 1\n\nhg.u, vi = hu, \u03c4 (g).vi ,\n\nand\n\nfor g \u2208 slm and u, v \u2208 V . In general, this Shapovalov form is nondegenerate on V\u03bc and\npositive definite on the real part of V\u03bc .\nFor example, the Shapovalov form on V\u03c9m\u22121 is the standard Euclidean inner product,\nhvi , vj i = \u03b4i,j , in the basis v1 , . . . , vm of Section 10.2.3. This induces the symmetric (tensor)\nShapovalov form on the tensor product V\u03c9\u2297mp\n, which is positive definite on the real part of\nm\u22121\n\u2297mp\nV\u03c9m\u22121 .\nTheorem 10.8 (Proposition 9.1 in [80]) The Gaudin Hamiltonians are symmetric with\nrespect to the tensor Shapovalov form,\nhKi (t).u, vi = hu, Ki (t).vi ,\nfor all i = 1, . . . , m, t \u2208 C, and u, v \u2208 V\u03c9\u2297mp\n.\nm\u22121\nWe give the most important consequence of this result for our story.\n121\n\n\fCorollary 10.9 When the parameters s and variable t are real, the Gaudin Hamiltonians\nK1 (t), . . . , Km (t) are real linear operators with real spectrum.\nProof. The Gaudin Hamiltonians M1 (t), . . . , Mm (t) are real linear operators which act on the\nreal part of V\u03c9\u2297mp\n, by their definition. The same is then also true of the Gaudin Hamiltonians\nm\u22121\nK1 (t), . . . , Km (t). But these are symmetric with respect to the Shapovalov form and thus\nhave real spectrum.\nProof of Theorem 1.9. Suppose that s \u2208 Rmp is general. By Corollary 10.9, the Gaudin\nHamiltonians for t \u2208 R acting on sing(V\u03c9mp\n[0]) are symmetric operators on a Euclidean\nm\u22121\nspace, and so have real eigenvalues. The Bethe vectors v(x, s) for critical points x of the\nmaster function with parameters s form an eigenbasis for the Gaudin Hamiltonians. As s\nis general, the eigenvalues are distinct by Corollary 10.7 (2), and so the Bethe vectors must\nbe real.\nGiven a critical point x, the eigenvalues \u03bb1 (t), . . . , \u03bbm (t) of the Bethe vectors are then\nreal rational functions, and so the fundamental differential operator Dx has real coefficients.\nBut then the fundamental space Vx of polynomials is real.\nThus each of the #m,p spaces of polynomials Vx whose Wronskian has roots s that were\nconstructed in Section 10.1 is in fact real. This proves Theorem 1.9.\n\n122\n\n\fChapter 11:\nBeyond the Shapiro Conjecture\nHere, we will touch on further topics related to the Shapiro Conjecture, including\nI Transversality and Discriminants.\nII Maximally Inflected Curves.\nIII The Shapiro Conjecture for flag manifolds (Monotone Conjecture).\nIV The Secant Conjecture and the Monotone Secant Conjecture\nV The Shapiro Conjecture for Lagrangian and Orthogonal Grassmannians.\nThis chapter currently only in a rough draft, and will require a complete rewrite.\n\n11.1\n\nTransversality\n\nIn Chapter 9, we presented a proof of the Shapiro Conjecture for rational functions by\nEremenko and Gabrielov [32]. Its main point was that there is no obstruction to analytically continuing the rational functions that were constructed in Chapter 8 to give rational\nfunctions with any given Wronskian having distinct real zeroes. The key to this was the\nassociation of a net to each rational function with only real critical points, which showed\nthat the analytic continuation was possible.\nA consequence of this proof is the statement that when min(m, p) = 2, the Wronski map\nWr : Gr(p, Cm+p ) \u2212\u2192 CPmp\nis unramified over the locus of hyperbolic polynomials with distinct (real) roots. This is in\nfact true for all Grassmannians, as Mukhin, Tarasov, and Varchenko showed [82].\nTheorem 11.1 The Wronski map is unramified over the locus of hyperbolic polynomials\nwith distinct roots, for any m and p.\nMore generally, given called Schubert data, \u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1n we can consider intersections\nof the form\n(11.1)\nX\u03b11 F\u2022 (s1 ) \u2229 X\u03b12 F\u2022 (s2 ) \u2229 * * * \u2229 X\u03b1n F\u2022 (sn ) ,\n\nwhere s1 , s2 , . . . , sn \u2208 P1 . Recall that a collection of subvarieties meet transversally if at all\npoints of their intersection, their tangent spaces meet properly (have the expected dimension\nof intersection). We rephrase Theorem 11.1.\nTransversality Theorem. If the points s1 , s2 , . . . , sn are real and distinct, then the intersection (11.1) is transverse.\nThis Transversality Theorem has a strengthening, which is stated in terms of real algebra.\n123\n\n\fDefinition 11.2 The discriminant is the locus in Pmp of critical values of the Wronski map\n(points over which it is ramified). It is an algebraic hypersurface and defined by a single\npolynomial, also called the discriminant.\nThe Transversality Theorem asserts that the discriminant does not meet the set of polynomials with distinct roots.\nMore generally, if we consider a given family of intersections of the form (11.1), then the\ndiscriminant is the set of points (s1 , s2 , . . . , sn ) for which this intersection is not transverse.\nAgain, this discriminant is a polynomial \u2206(s1 , s2 , . . . , sn ) in the parameters (s1 , s2 , . . . , sn ) \u2208\n(P1 )n , and the Transversality Conjecture asserts that \u2206 does not vanish when the parameters\nare real and distinct, that is, when si 6= sj , for all i, j. We conjecture something much\nstronger.\nConjecture 11.3 (Discriminant Conjecture) The discriminant polynomial \u2206 is a sum\nof squares. Each term in the sum is a monomial in the differences (si \u2212 sj ).\nThere is some evidence for this conjecture. For the problem of two lines in 3-space\nmeeting four lines l(s), l(t), l(u), and l(v), each tangent to the rational normal curve, the\ndiscriminant is a constant multiple of\n(s \u2212 t)2 (u \u2212 v)2 + (s \u2212 u)2 (t \u2212 v)2 + (s \u2212 v)2 (t \u2212 u)2 .\nFor Gr(2, 5), the discriminant of the Schubert intersection\nX F\u2022 (0) \u2229 X F\u2022 (s) \u2229 X F\u2022 (t) \u2229 X F\u2022 (u) \u2229 X F\u2022 (v) \u2229 X F\u2022 (\u221e) ,\nhas degree 20 in the variables s, t, u, and v, and it has 711 different terms. Ad hoc methods [110] showed that it was a sum of squares.\u2020 This was quite surprising. Hilbert [50]\nshowed that not every polynomial of even degree greater than 2 in four variables that is\nnonnegative can be written as a sum of squares.\nWe feel that it is a useful project to further investigate these discriminant polynomials.\n\n11.2\n\nMaximally inflected curves\n\nThis section represents joint work with Kharlamov [62]. A list f1 (t), f2 (t), . . . , fk (t) of polynomials with degree d defines a map \u03c6 : P1 \u2192 Pk\u22121 as follows,\n\u03c6 : P1 \u220b t \u2212\u2192 [f1 (t) : f2 (t) : * * * : fk (t)] \u2208 Pk\u22121 .\nThe image of the curve is convex at a point \u03c6(t) if and only if the first k\u22121 derivatives of\n\u03c6(t) are linearly independent. The failure to be convex is measured exactly by the vanishing\nof the Wronskian of the polynomials f1 (t), f2 (t), . . . , fk (t). We say that \u03c6 is ramified at a\npoint t if this Wronskian vanishes at t. Another geometric term is that the curve \u03c6 has an\ninflection point (or flex) at t. This corresponds exactly to the usual notion of an inflection\n\u2020\n\nGive more details?\n\n124\n\n\fpoint for plane curves. A rational curve \u03c6 of degree d in Pk\u22121 has k(d+1\u2212k) flexes, counted\nwith multiplicity.\nThe connection between the Schubert calculus and rational curves in projective space\n(linear series on P1 ) originated in work of Castelnuovo [19] on g-nodal rational curves. This\nled to the use of Schubert calculus in Brill-Noether theory (see Chapter 5 of [49] for an\nelaboration). In turn, the theory of limit linear series of Eisenbud and Harris [30, 31]\nprovides essential tools to show reality of the special Schubert calculus [108]. (That result\non the special Schubert calculus was a generalization of Theorem 8.2 of Chapter 8.)\nMukhin, Tarasov, Varchenko Theorem for rational curves. If a rational curve in\nPk\u22121 has all of its flexes real, then it must be real.\nDefinition 11.4 A real rational curve with all of its flexes real is said to be maximally\ninflected.\nThe Shapiro conjecture asserts that there are lots (maximally many, in fact) of these\nmaximally inflected curves.\nUp to projective transformation and reparameterization, there are only three real rational\nplane cubic curves. They are represented by the equations\ny 2 = x3 + x2 ,\n\ny 2 = x3 \u2212 x2 ,\n\nand\n\ny 2 = x3 ,\n\nand they have the shapes shown in Figure 11.1. All three have a real flex at infinity and are\n\nFigure 11.1: Real rational cubics.\nsingular at the origin. The first has a real node and no other real flexes, the second has a\nsolitary point and two real flexes at ( 43 , \u00b1 3\u221a4 3 ) (we indicate these with dots and the complex\nconjugate tangents at the solitary point with dashed lines), and the third has a real cusp.\nThe last two are maximally inflected, while the first is not.\nThe Schubert calculus gives 5 rational quartics with 6 given points of inflection and\nFigure 11.2 shows 5 maximally inflected curves with flexes at {\u22123, \u22121, 0, 1, 3, \u221e}. (Each\nnodal curve has 2 flexes at its node, which is a consequence of the symmetry in the choice\nof flexes.) We indicate the differences in the parameterizations of these curves, labeling the\nflex at \u22123 by the larger dot and the flex at \u22121 by the circle. The solitary points are not\ndrawn. The first three curves have two solitary points, while the last 2 have three solitary\npoints.\n\n125\n\n\fFigure 11.2: The 5 curves with flexes at {\u22123, \u22121, 0, 1, 3, \u221e}.\nHere are a few quintics. The flexes are indicated (the symmetric curves have one additional flex at infinity), but we do not draw solitary points. Also, the open circles represent\ntwo flexes which have merged into a planar point.\n\nFinally, here are four singular quintics. The solitary point is drawn on the second.\n\nNone of these maximally inflected curves had many nodes. Indeed, rational quartics\ntypically have 3 double points and quintics have 6, yet we saw quartics with at most 1 node\nand quintics with at most 3 nodes. More generally, consider a maximally inflected curve\nwith only flexes and cusps, and whose other singularities are ordinary double points. Let \u03b9\nbe its number of flexes\n\u0001 and \u03ba be its number of cusps. Then \u03b9 + 2\u03ba = 3(d \u2212 2). By the genus\nformula, it has d\u22121\n\u2212 \u03ba double points. The following theorem is an easy consequence of\n2\nthe Klein [68] and Pl\u00fccker [88] formulas.\n126\n\n\fTheorem 11.5 (Topological Restrictions [62]) Suppose that a maximally inflected curve\nhas only flexes, cusps, and ordinary double points, and let \u03b9 and \u03ba be its number of flexes\u0001\nand cusps, respectively. Then it has at least d \u2212 2 \u2212 \u03ba solitary points and at most d\u22122\n2\nnodes.\n\u0001\nThus maximally inflected cubics have at most 3\u22122\n= 0 nodes, quartics have at most\n2\n\u0001\n\u0001\n4\u22122\n5\u22122\n= 1 node, and quintics have at most 2 = 3 nodes.\n2\nThe existence of curves satisfying the hypotheses of Theorem 11.5 is not guaranteed, even\nif we know the Shapiro conjecture. For example, the construction in Theorem 4 of Chapter 8\ndoes not guarantee that the maximally inflected curve has only ordinary double points.\nThere are, however two constructions which guarantee curves having only double points.\nThe first uses Shustin's\npatchworking of singular curves [101] to obtain degenerate Harnack\n\u0001\nd\u22121\ncurves with 2 solitary points (the figure on the left illustrates this patchworking). The\nsecond perturbs d \u2212 2 lines tangent to a conic to obtain maximally inflected curves of degree\nd with the minimal number of solitary points (and up to d \u2212 2 cusps).\n\n=\u21d2\n\nThe topological classification of maximally inflected plane quintics is open.\u2020 Also, maximally inflected curves in higher-dimensional space have not been investigated. For example,\nwhich knot types can occur for maximally inflected space curves? We speculate that there\nshould be some restrictions on the number of real quadrisecants of a maximally inflected\nspace curve.\n\n11.3\n\nThe Shapiro Conjecture for flag manifolds\n\nThe Shapiro conjecture involved linear spaces satisfying incidence conditions imposed by\nflags osculating the rational normal curve at real points. One natural variant is to consider\nflags satisfying incidence conditions imposed by osculating flags.\nExample 11.6 Consider partial flags of subspaces m \u2282 H, where m is a line which lies on\na plane H in P3 . Here are two typical incidence conditions on these flags.\n\u2022 m meets a fixed line l(t) tangent to the rational normal curve \u03b3 at the point \u03b3(t).\n\u2020\n\nExplain a couple of open questions\n\n127\n\n\f\u2022 H contains a fixed point \u03b3(t) of the rational normal curve.\n\nWe consider the problem of partial flags m \u2282 H where m meets three tangent lines\nl(\u22121), l(0), and l(1) to \u03b3, and H contains two points \u03b3(v) and \u03b3(w). First observe that\nH contains the line \u03bb(v, w) spanned by these two points. But then m must also meet this\nsecant line \u03bb(v, w), as m \u2282 H. In this way, we see that this problem reduces to our old\nfriend, the problem of four lines. Now, however, we seek lines m which meet three tangent\nlines l(\u22121), l(0), and l(1) to the rational normal curve, and one secant line \u03bb(v, w). Given\nsuch a line m, we may recover H as the linear span of m and \u03bb(v, w).\nAs in Section 4 of Chapter 7, we begin with the quadric Q containing the three lines\nl(\u22121), l(0), and l(1) tangent to the rational normal curve \u03b3. The lines meeting l(\u22121), l(0),\n\nl(1)\n\nQ\n\n\u03b3\n\nl(\u22121)\n\nl(0)\n\nFigure 11.3: Quadric containing three lines tangent to the rational normal curve.\nl(1), and the secant line \u03bb(v, w) correspond to the points where \u03bb(v, w) meets the quadric\nQ. In Figure 11.4, we display a secant line \u03bb(v, w) which meets the hyperboloid in two\nreal points, and therefore these choices for v and w give two real solutions to our geometric\nproblem. There is also a secant line which meets the hyperboloid Q in no real points, and\nhence in two complex conjugate points. For this secant line, neither flag solving our problem\nis real. We show this configuration in Figure 11.5.\nThe original Shapiro conjecture concerned partial flags of a given type meeting flags\nosculating the rational normal curve (at real points), and it asserted that all such partial\nflags would be real. This example shows that the Shapiro conjecture fails for flags, but not\ntoo badly. It is useful to consider this failure schematically. In Figure 11.3 we represent the\nrational normal curve \u03b3 as a circle, and indicate the relative positions of three tangent lines\nand the secant line. Observe that in the diagram on the left, one may travel along the circle,\nfirst encountering the three points where the lines are tangent and then the two points where\nthe line is secant. If we record the dimension of the piece of the flag m \u2282 H which is affected\nby the tangent line or point on the rational normal curve as we travel along the circle, we\nget the sequence (1, 1, 1, 2, 2), which is weakly increasing. The reading the diagram on the\nright either gives the sequence (1, 1, 2, 1, 2), or its reverse (2, 1, 2, 1, 1), or (1, 2, 1, 2, 1), none\nof which are monotone.\n128\n\n\fl(1)\n\n\u03bb(v, w)\n6\n\n6\n\nl(\u22121)\n\u03b3\n\nl(0)\n\nQ\n\n\u03b3(v)\n\n\u03b3(w)\n\nFigure 11.4: A secant line meeting Q.\n\n11.3.1\n\nThe Monotone Conjecture\n\nA partial flag E\u2022 of type a = (a1 , a2 , . . . , ak ) is a sequence of linear subspaces\nE\u2022 : Ea1 \u2282 Ea2 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Eak \u2282 Cn ,\nwhere ai = dim Ei . Its possible positions with respect to a fixed (complete) flag are encoded\nby certain permutations, \u03b1. The original Shapiro conjecture concerned partial flags of a given\ntype meeting flags osculating the rational normal curve (at real points), and it asserted that\nall such partial flags would be real. The example that we just gave shows that it was wrong\u2020 .\nHowever, it can be repaired.\nA position \u03b1 for flags E\u2022 of type a which may be expressed in terms of only one piece\nEai of the flag E\u2022 is called Grassmannian of index ai . When this occurs, write \u03b9(\u03b1) = ai .\nIn the counterexample to the Shapiro conjecture, both conditions are Grassmannian-one\nhas index 2 (for the requirement that m meet a tangent line) and the other has index 3 (for\nthe requirement that H meet a point on the rational normal curve.) These differ from the\ndimension of the linear spaces m and H, as we were working in projective 3-space, rather\nthan a 4-dimensional vector space.\nConjecture 11.7 (Monotone Conjecture) Let \u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1m be Grassmannian conditions on flags of type a whose indices satisfy \u03b9(\u03b11 ) \u2264 \u03b9(\u03b12 ) \u2264 * * * \u2264 \u03b9(\u03b1m ). Then if\ns1 < s2 < * * * < sm are real numbers, the intersection\nm\n\\\n\ni=1\n\nX\u03b1i F\u2022 (si )\n\nis transverse with all points real.\n\u2020\n\nIn fact, it fails for the first nontrivial problem on a flag manifold.\n\n129\n\n\f\u03b3(v)\n\n\u03bb(v, w)\n\n\u000f\u0003\n\n\u0003\n\u0003\n\n\u0003\n\n\u0003\n\n\u0003\n\u0003\n\n\u0003\n\u0003\n\n\u0003\n\nl(1)\n\n\u001e\n\nl(0)\n\nl(\u22121)\n\u03b3\n\u03b3(w)\nFigure 11.5: A secant line not meeting Q.\n\nFigure 11.6:\n\nAlways real.\n\nNot always real.\n\nAs with the Shapiro conjecture for Grassmannians, it is known that transversality will\nimply that the points of intersection are real. There is also a similar discriminant conjecture.\nThe preprime generated by polynomials g1 , g2 , . . . , gm is the collection of polynomials f of\nthe form\nf = \u03c30 + \u03c31 g1 + \u03c32 g2 + * * * + \u03c3m gm ,\nwhere the polynomials \u03c3 are sums of squares. Any polynomial f in this preprime is positive\non the set\nK := {x | gi (x) > 0}\nand a representation of f as an element of this preprime is a certificate of its positivity on\nK.\nConjecture 11.8 (Discriminant Conjecture) The discriminant of the polynomial sys130\n\n\ftem associated to an intersection of Schubert varieties defined by Grassmannian conditions\nas in the monotone conjecture lies in the preprime generated by the differences (si \u2212 sj ) for\ni > j.\nThe point of this conjecture is that not only is the discriminant positive on the set\n{(s1 , s2 , . . . , sm ) | s1 < s2 < * * * < sm } of monotone parameters, but that it has a special\nform from which this positivity is transparent. It is known that not all polynomials which\nare positive on a set of this form can lie in the preprime generated by the differences si \u2212 sj\nfor i > j.\nThere is a continually unfolding story of the Shapiro conjecture and its generalizations,\nboth to secant flags (by Eremenko, Gabrielov, Shapiro, and Vainshtein [35]) and for other\nflag manifolds, for other groups. Very few computations have been done (but see [111] for\nthe beginnings for the Lagrangian Grassmannian and orthogonal Grassmannian.)\nWe end these notes with the remark that, just as they were being completed, Mukhin,\nTarasov, and Varchenko [81] gave a proof the the Shapiro conjecture for Grassmannians,\nusing the Bethe Ansatz and the Gaudin model (a connection between differential equations\nwith polynomial solutions, representation theory of the special linear group, and intersections\nof Schubert varieties given by flags osculating the rational normal curve). The discriminant\nconjecture remain open, however.\nTopics to work on for next rewrite:\n1. Discuss some of the evidence for the Monotone Conjecture\n2. Explain how the result of Eremenko, Gabrielov, Shapiro, and Vainshtein (Section 9.2)\nestablishes the monotone conjecture for certain flag manifolds.\n3.
