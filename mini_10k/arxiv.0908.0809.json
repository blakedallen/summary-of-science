Introduction\nMinority games (MG) [1, 2] are simple models proposed about a decade ago to understand\nthe origin of the cooperative phenomena and nontrivial fluctuations observed in financial\nmarkets, on the basis of so-called inductive decision making by imperfect interacting agents\n[3]. With the recent exposure of the inadequacy of classical economic modeling that assumes\nfull rationality, intelligence and honesty of market players and evolution to an efficient stable\nmarket, the case for the alternative MG approach to market models is probably beyond\ndiscussion. The further strength of MG-type models is that they can be solved analytically;\nespecially the generating functional analysis (GFA) method has proven to be an effective tool\nin this field [4, 5, 6]. We refer to the recent textbooks [7, 8] for historical backgrounds, the\nconnection between MGs and markets, details on mathematical methods, and full references.\nStandard MG models are now understood reasonably well, so the next task is to\ngeneralize the mathematical technology developed so as to apply to models that are more\nrealistic economically. In this paper we try to contribute to this aim, by studying analytically\nMG-type models in which we generalize the agents' strategy valuation rules: the strategy\ntype to be rewarded (and by how much) depends on the overall market bid A. Agents can\nswitch from a contrarian to a trend-following strategy, and adjust their level of caution, on\nthe basis of how anomalous they perceive the market to be. Such ingredients are incorporated\neasily into the fabric of MG-type models, by enhancing the valuation update with a function\nF [A] of the excess demand; the question is how to decide which agent behaviour should be\nencoded in this function, and how to solve mathematically the resulting GFA equations.\nBy changing the magnitude of the valuation updates in the MG in an A-dependent way,\nwe can model a preference of agents (who remain contrarians) for profitable decisions with\nlarge excess demand/supply (high-risk high-gain behaviour), or model the opposite situation\nwhere they prefer small excess demand/supply (low-risk low-gain behaviour). If we also allow\nagents to switch to trend-following, there are two possible routes. One could argue that when\n\n\fTheory of agent-based market models with controlled levels of greed and anxiety\n\n2\n\nmarkets are booming, equity prices tend to rise slowly and the trading volume increases (so\nagents are trend-followers, as in the majority game [10]), until the magnitude |A| of the\noverall market bid becomes too large, leading to turmoil and contrarian behaviour. This was\nthe view of [11, 12]. Alternatively, one could argue that for small |A| the market would be\nregarded as normal, and agents would seek advantage by contrarian trading, whereas large\n|A| would be regarded as anomalous, prompting panic-driven trend-following.\nIn this paper we first develop the theory for MG-type models with arbitrary valuation\nupdate functions F [A]. Then we focus on the above three agent behaviour scenarios: a\nmodel of strict contrarians with controlled degrees of caution versus greed, one where nonvolatile markets are interpreted as risk free and prompt trend-following (agents only become\ncontrarians under volatile conditions), and one where in non-volatile markets agents are\ncontrarians (switching to panic-driven trend-following under volatile conditions). Although\nthe latter two cases are mathematically similar, they lead to qualitatively different solutions.\nWe will find that certain regions of the phase diagram are characterized by prominent\nremanence effects, with multiple locally stable states, prompting us to rely on approximations\nof the Maxwell-construction type. As a result, whereas our predictions are confirmed\nsatisfactorily by numerical simulations in non-remanent cases, when there is remanence, there\nremain deviations and gaps in our understanding which will require further investigation.\n\n2. Definitions\nLet there to be N agents in the game, labeled by i \u2208 {1, . . . , N }, where N is odd. The game\nproceeds at discrete steps t = 0, 1, 2, . . .. At every step t each agent takes a binary decision\nbi (t) \u2208 {\u22121, 1}, the 'bid', representing e.g. buying (\u22121) versus selling (+1). A re-scaled\nPN\naggregate overall bid at step t is defined as A(t) = N \u22121/2 i=1 bi (t) + Ae (t), where Ae (t) is\nan external contribution, representing perturbations, the impact of large market operators,\nor the action of regulators. At each step, the agents are provided with external information,\nwhich in fake history MGs is a random number \u03bc(t) \u2208 {1, . . . , p}. Each agent i has two\nstrategies Ria , with a = 1, 2, with which to map each \u03bc to a trading action:\nRia : {1, . . . , p} \u2192 {\u22121, 1}\nA strategy functions as a lookup-table with p entries, all of which are drawn independently\nat random from {\u22121, 1} (with equal probabilities) before the start of the game. If agent i\n\u03bc(t)\nuses strategy a at step t, then he will act (deterministically) according to bi (t) = Ria .\nIn the standard MG an agent makes profit if he finds himself in the minority, i.e. if\nA(t)bi (t) < 0. Each agent monitors the performance of his two strategies (irrespective\nof whether they were used), by measuring the so-called valuations pia (t), defined via\n\u03bc(t)\npia (t + 1) = pia (t) \u2212 \u03b7\u0303A(t) Ria . Here \u03b7\u0303 > 0 denotes a 'learning rate'. At each step t of\nthe game, each agent i will select his best strategy ai (t) at that stage of the process, defined\nas ai (t) = arg maxa\u2208{1,2} {pia (t)}. Agents thus behave as 'contrarians'. Here we generalize\nthis rule in the spirit of [11], to incorporate the possibility that whether agents behave as\ncontrarians or trend-followers may depend dynamically on whether they perceive the market\n\u03bc(t)\nstate A(t) to be close to or far from its 'natural' value: pia (t+1) = pia (t)\u2212 \u03b7\u0303Ria F [A(t)], with\nF [\u2212A] = \u2212F [A] (to retain A = 0 as the 'natural' value for the overall bid). In the 'batch'\nversion of the above dynamics one replaces in the evolution equations for the valuations the\nrandomly drawn information \u03bc(t) by an average over {1, . . . , p}. The result is\np\n\u03b7\u0303 X\n\u03bc\npia (t+1) = pia (t) \u2212 \u221a\nF [A\u03bc (t)]Ria\nN \u03bc=1\n\nA\u03bc (t)\n\nN\n1 X \u03bc\n= Ae (t) + \u221a\nRiai (t)\nN i=1\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n\fTheory of agent-based market models with controlled levels of greed and anxiety\n\n3\n\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u2212 Ri2\n),\nWe switch in the usual manner to new variables qi (t) = 12 [pi1 (t) \u2212 pi2 (t)], \u03be\u03bci = 21 (Ri1\nP \u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\ni\n\u22121/2\n1\n\u03c9\u03bc = 2 (Ri1 + Ri2 ), and \u03a9\u03bc = N\n\u03c9\n.\nWe\nchoose\n\u03b7\u0303\n=\n2,\nand\nadd\nperturbations\ni i\n\u03b8i (t) in order to define response functions. We introduce decision noise by replacing\nsgn[qi (t)] \u2192 \u03c3[qi (t), zi (t)], in which the {zj (t)} are independent and zero average Gaussian\nrandom numbers (the standard examples are additive and multiplicative noise definitions,\ncorresponding to \u03c3[q, z] = sgn[q + T z] and \u03c3[q, z] = sgn[q] sgn[1 + T z]).

For \u03c4 = 1 the situation is reversed.\nWe will write averaging over the stochastic process (3) as h. . .i.

In (77) we have already one relation\nfor the two objects, so we need one more equation connecting A(z) to F (z) to obtain closed\nformulae.

What is left is to find the statistics W (a|z) of\nthe non-frozen bid contributions, which requires ans\u00e4tze.\nTo calculate W (a|z) we assume the response function G to decay much more slowly\nthan the times over which the \u00c3(t, z) are correlated, so that to the time summation in (78)\nwe can apply the central limit theorem. This tells us that also the \u00c3(t, z) must be zeroaverage Gaussian. Let us define the covariance matrix \u039ett\u2032 (z) = h\u00c3(t, z)\u00c3(t\u2032 , z)i, it must be\ntime-translation invariant, so we write \u039e(t, z) = \u039es+t,s (z).

As soon as \u03c7R \u2264 0, we enter the fully frozen\nstate c = \u03c6 = 1 induced by positive feedback in the valuation dynamics.

Apparently,\nthe general scenario is that where \u03c7R < 0 and the system is in the fully frozen remanent\nstate. Hence \u03c7 < 1, and its value is given by formula (74), which reduces to\n\np\n\n2\u03c0\u03b1(1+c) i\u22121\n\u2208 (0, 1)\n(97)\n2\u03c3[\u221e]\nThe condition for leaving the frozen remanent state, viz. \u03c7 = 1, is seen to coincide with\nthe condition for having non-invertibility for the overall bid process, but this condition\nwill clearly never be met; the system is always in the fully frozen remanent state.\n\nh\n\n\u03c7= 1+\n\n5.

There is clearly excellent\nagreement between the theoretical predictions and the computer simulations.\n\nSo all systems with monotonically increasing anti-symmetric F [A] will, provided they have an\nergodic regime, always exhibit a \u03c7 \u2192 \u221e transition at the conventional MG value \u03b1c \u2248 0.3374,\nirrespective of the actual form of F [A].\nAway from the transition one should expect a dependence of the values of the persistent\norder parameters on the choice made for F [A]. However, for 'sensible' choices of F [A] one\ngenerally finds this dependence to be weak. To illustrate this we now focus on a particular\nclass of models, with monotonic valuation update functions of the form\nF [A] = sgn[A]|A|\u03b3 ,\n\n\u03b3\u22650\n\n(114)\n\nThese models are relatively straightforward generalizations of the original MG (which\ncorresponds to \u03b3 = 1), nevertheless for \u03b3 6= 1 the standard solution route (i.e. generating\nfunctional analysis of the strategy selection process, without including the overall bid\ndynamics explicitly in the formalism), would not have worked. For \u03b3 > 1 the agents with\n(114) place more importance on making money by exploiting large fluctuations (|A| > 1), so\ncan be described as greedy high-risk contrarians, whereas for \u03b3 < 1 they prefer to exploit\nsmall market fluctuations, and operate as cautious low-risk contrarians.\nWe know from the above argument that their \u03c7 \u2192 \u221e ergodicity breaking transition\npoint \u03b1c will be identical to that of the standard MG. Let us now calculate the persistent\norder parameters in the ergodic region \u03b1 > \u03b1c . On physical grounds one does not expect a\nnegative susceptibility and F [A] increases monotonically, hence \u2206(z)\n\u221a will\n\u221a be invertible, and\nwe can transform the integrals (100) via the substitution z = \u2206(x) 2/ 1 + c, and find\n\nZ\n\ndx \u2212\u22062 (x)/(1+c)\n\u221a\ne\n2\u03c0\n\u221a Z\ndx \u2212\u22062 (x)/(1+c) 2 \u2032\n2\n\u221a\ne\nx \u2206 (x)\nI2 (c, \u03c7) = \u221a\n1+c\n2\u03c0\nI1 (c, \u03c7) =\n\n(115)\n(116)\n\nThis removes the need for inversion of \u2206(z).

One also expects that as the susceptibility goes to zero for large alpha the behavior of\nthe system should be almost independent of the value of \u03b3. For \u03b3 \u2264 3 these predictions are\nborne out by numerical simulations (all carried out with N = 4097, and measured during 1000\nsteps after an 2000 steps equilibration period), as shown in figures 1-4. For large \u03b3 (excessive\nagent greed), however, in spite of the agents still operating as contrarians, the ergodic phase\nappears to be destroyed by their increasing focus on big-gain big-risk decisions, and there is\nno longer an efficient market regime with low volatility.\n\n\fTheory of agent-based market models with controlled levels of greed and anxiety\n\n17\n\n6. Applications - dynamic switching between contrarian trading and\ntrend following\nNext we inspect a class of models in which agents switch from trend-following to contrarian\nbehaviour, dependent on the absolute value |A| of the overall market bid. The rationale is\nto create more realistic agent behaviour, based on interpreting A as a measure of the price\nreturns in the market. One example was proposed in [11], corresponding to F [A] = \u01ebA3 \u2212 A,\n\u221a\nwith \u01eb >\u221a0. This model, in which agents are trend-follows for |A| < 1/ \u01eb but contrarians for\n|A| > 1/ \u01eb, can not be solved analytically using the standard generating functional analysis\nroute. Here we generalize their model slightly, allowing also for the reverse tendency, where\nagents become trend-followers for large instead of small |A|, and analyze the case\nF [A] = \u03c4 A(1 \u2212 A2 /A20 ),\n\nwith \u03c4 = \u00b11, A0 > 0\n(122)\n\u221a\nThe model of [11] corresponds to \u03c4 = \u22121 and A0 = 1/ \u01eb. For \u03c4 = 1, in contrast, agents\nbehave as contrarians for modest deviations of the returns from their average value, but\nswitch to herding when they perceive the market to be anomalous, i.e. for |A| > A0 . For\nA0 \u2192 \u221e, the model (122) reduces either to the standard MG (for \u03c4 = 1) or to a majority\ntype game (for \u03c4 = \u22121); for A0 \u2192 0 one anticipates the opposite.\n\n6.1.

Whether \u2206(z) is invertible will depend on A0 . If A20 (1+ \u03c7\u0303\u22121 ) > 32 (1\u2212c), there\nwill always be a region of non-invertibility, with three solutions z of the equation \u2206(z) = \u2206.\nThe latter are the roots of a cubic equation and can therefore be calculated analytically,\nz 3 \u2212 z A20 (1 + \u03c7\u0303)/\u03c7\u0303 \u2212\n\n\u0002\n\n\u0003 A2 \u2206\n3\n(1 \u2212 c) + 0 = 0\n2\n\u03c7\u0303\n\n(124)\n\nFollowing [13] we write the cubic equation in the form z 3 + 3qz \u2212 2r = 0 by defining\n1\n(1 \u2212 c) \u2212 A20 (1 + \u03c7\u0303)/3\u03c7\u0303,\nr = \u2212A20 \u2206/2\u03c7\u0303\n2\nWe can then classify the solution(s) of the equation \u2206(z) = \u2206 as follows:\nq=\n\nq3 + r2 > 0 :\nq3 + r2 < 0 :\n\np\n\np\n\nq 3 + r 2 ]1/3 + [r \u2212 q 3 + r 2 ]1/3\n1\n1\nr\nthree solns, z1 = 2|q| 2 cos( arccos( p\n))\n3\n|q|3\n\u221a\n1\n1\n1\nr\n1\nr\nz2 = \u2212|q| 2 cos( arccos( p\n)) + 3|q| 2 sin( arccos( p\n))\n3\n3\n3\n|q|\n|q|3\n\u221a\n1\n1\n1\nr\n1\nr\nz3 = \u2212|q| 2 cos( arccos( p\n)) \u2212 3|q| 2 sin( arccos( p\n))\n3\n3\n3\n|q|\n|q|3\none soln,\n\nz = [r +\n\n(125)\n\n(126)\n(127)\n(128)\n(129)\n\nOur solution must respect the symmetry \u2206\u22121 (\u2212z) = \u2212\u2206\u22121 (z), which translates into\nsearching for a root with z(\u2212r) = \u2212z(r). Inspection reveals that for q 3 + r 2 > 0 the solution\n(126) has the desired symmetry. For q 3 + r 2 < 0 we find that z2 (\u2212r) = \u2212z2 (r), and that\nz3 (\u2212r) = \u2212z1 (r). Hence z1,3 (r) represent two 'extremal' solution branches (related to each\nother by inversion symmetry), and z2 (r) represents a middle branch. The region of multiple\nsolutions is defined by |r| < |q|3/2 , where we have infinitely many options for assigning a\nvalue to \u2206\u22121 (z). The conventional one is the Maxwell construction, based on assuming\nthe multiplicity of solutions to be caused by remanence.

Our second option implies assuming the middle\nbranch to be stable, i.e. choosing z2 (r) for |r| < |q|3/2 . The two options are illustrated in\nfigure 5. Assessing which of these choices (if any) is correct would in principle require a\nstability analysis of the asymptotic solution of the overall bid dynamics.\nUpon translating the above arguments into the language of \u2206\u22121 (z), the resulting picture\nis the following, where still q = 12 (1\u2212c) \u2212 31 A20 (1+ \u03c7\u0303)/\u03c7\u0303 but now with r(z) = \u2212 21 A20 z/\u03c7\u0303:\nq > 0 or q < 0, |r(z)| > |q|3/2 :\n\n\u2206\u22121 (z) = [r(z)+\n\n1\n\np\n\nq 3 +r 2 (z)] 3 + [r(z)\u2212\n\np\n\n1\n\nq 3 +r 2 (z)] 3\n(130)\n\nHere \u2206(z) is fully invertible.

There (122) reduces to\nthe standard MG for \u03c4 = 1 and to the standard majority game for \u03c4 = \u22121, both of which we\nanalyzed in section 4.4. The correct solution must reproduce limA0 \u2192\u221e \u2206\u22121 (z) = z/(1 + \u03c7\u0303).\nFor A0 \u2192 \u221e, \u03c7\u0303 \u2208\n/ (\u22121, 0), and finite z one has q < 0 and |r(z)| < |q|3/2 (in fact\n3/2\nlimA0 \u2192\u221e\n= 0), so we do indeed probe the region of ambiguity. Our test reveals,\n\u221a r(z)/|q|\nusing 3 sin( 13 arccos(x)) \u2212 cos( 31 arccos(x)) = \u2212 23 x + O(x3 ), that for A0 \u2192 \u221e:\nMaxwell soln :\nalternative soln :\n\n\u2206\u22121 (z) = A0 |1 + \u03c7\u0303\u22121 |1/2 sgn(z) + O(A00 ),\n\u2206\n\n\u22121\n\n(z) = z/(1 + \u03c7\u0303) +\n\nO(A\u22121\n0 ),\n\n\u22121\n\nincorrect\n\n(133)\n\ncorrect\n\n(134)\n\nFor \u03c7\u0303 \u2208 (\u22121, 0) we have q > 0, so there is no ambiguity: \u2206 (z) is given by (130), which for\nA0 \u2192 \u221e reproduces correctly \u2206\u22121 (z) = z/(1 + \u03c7\u0303) + O(A\u22121\n0 ). Hence, for A0 \u2192 \u221e the only\n\n\fTheory of agent-based market models with controlled levels of greed and anxiety\n\n19\n\nacceptable solution is (130,132) \u2021. We resolve the remaining ambiguity as follows: since the\nd\npure majority and minority games always exhibit limz\u21920 dz\n\u2206\u22121 (z) > 0, we take this property\nto hold generally. This means that for weak random bids the effect of agent interaction is to\npush these bids back to zero (contrarian action) or to amplify them (trend-following), but\nthere is no change of sign. For \u03c4 = \u22121 we now have either 32 (1 \u2212 c)/A20 > 1 \u2212 \u03c7\u22121 and the\nunambiguous solution (130), or we have 23 (1\u2212c)/A20 < 1\u2212\u03c7\u22121 and the Maxwell option (131).\nFor \u03c4 = 1 we must always demand 23 (1 \u2212 c)/A20 < 1 + \u03c7\u22121 and the non-Maxwell option (132).\n\n6.2. Conventional \u03c7 \u2192 \u221e transitions\nWe can now calculate transition lines. In the present model we can have a traditional \u03c7 \u2192 \u221e\ntransition, a transition where \u03c7R changes sign (switching from a minority to a majority-type\ngame), and a transition marking the emergence of jumps in \u2206\u22121 (z). We start with the\ncalculation of the \u03c7 \u2192 \u221e transitions.\nFor \u03c4 = 1, \u03c7 \u2192 \u221e and finite z one has r(z) = O(\u03c7\u22121 ) and q = 21 (1\u2212c) \u2212 13 A20 + O(\u03c7\u22121 ),\nfrom which it follows that if lim\u03c7\u2192\u221e 32 (1\u2212c) 6= A20 then\n\n\u22121\nz 3\n(1\u2212c)/A20 \u2212 1\n+ O(\u03c7\u22122 )\n(135)\n\u03c7 2\nFrom this one extracts lim\u03c7\u2192\u221e I1 (c, \u03c7) = lim\u03c7\u2192\u221e I2 (c, \u03c7) = 0, and via the same arguments\nthat applied to models with invertible bid impact functions one is led to\n\u221a\n\u221a\nS0\nlim\n(136)\nlim \u03c7\u03c7R = 1,\nlim \u03c7S0 = 1+c,\n= sgn(\u03c7R ) 1+c\n\u03c7\u2192\u221e \u03c7R\n\u03c7\u2192\u221e\n\u03c7\u2192\u221e\n\ni\n\nh\n\n\u2206\u22121 (z) = \u2212\n\nIf \u03c7R > 0, our equations (71,72,73) close for \u03c7 \u2192 \u221e exactly as they would for the conventional\nMG, with the standard \u03c7 \u2192 \u221e transition at the value \u03b1c \u2248 0.3374. If \u03c7R < 0, on\nthe other hand, no \u03c7 \u2192 \u221e transition is possible. Taking into account the requirement\nd\n\u2206\u22121 (z) > 0 implies that for \u03c4 = 1 the \u03c7 \u2192 \u221e transition exists only if A20 > 23 (1\u2212c).\nlimz\u21920 dz\nHere q < 0 and r(z) = O(\u03c7\u22121 ), so we are in the remanent region.\nFor \u03c4 = \u22121, \u03c7 \u2192 \u221e and finite z one still has r(z) = O(\u03c7\u22121 ) and q = 12 (1\u2212c) \u2212 31 A20 +\n\u22121\nO(\u03c7 ). So if lim\u03c7\u2192\u221e 23 (1\u2212c) 6= A20 then for q < 0 we will have |r(z)| \u226a |q|3/2 .

If A20 > 32 (1\u2212c),\non the other hand, the \u03c7 \u2192 \u221e line will be in the remanent region. With some foresight we\nnow write A20 = 23 (1\u2212c) + 21 (1+c)\u039e2 with \u039e \u2265 0, and obtain\n\nr\n\nI1 (c, \u03c7) = \u039e\nwhich leads to\nU (v) \u2212 1 =\n\n1+c\n+ O(\u03c7\u22121 ),\n\u03c0\n\np\n\n\u039e2 \u2212 \u039e\n\n2/\u03c0\n\n,\n\nI2 (c, \u03c7) =\n\n1\n(1+c)\u039e2 + O(\u03c7\u22121 )\n2\n\np\n\n\u03b1 = Erf(v)/[1 \u2212 \u039e\n\n(139)\n\n2/\u03c0]\n\n(140)\n\nUpon solving the first equation for \u039e,\nn\no\np\n1\n\u039e\u00b1 (v) = \u221a\n2\u2212U (v) \u00b1 [2\u2212U (v)]2 + 2\u03c0[U (v)\u22121]\n2\u03c0\n\n(141)\n\np\n\n1\u2212\u039e\n\n2/\u03c0\n\n\u2021 It is surprising that in this problem the Maxwell construction is not always the correct way to handle\nthe multiplicity of solutions, given its track record in physical many-particle systems. However,\nminority games do not obey detailed balance, so intuition developed on the basis of bifurcation\nanalyses obtained via free energy minimization in equilibrium systems may be misleading.\n\n\fTheory of agent-based market models with controlled levels of greed and anxiety\n\n20\n\nwe then arrive at a convenient parametrization of the transition line in the (\u03b1, A0 ) plane,\nwith v \u2265 0 as a parameter. The line turns out to have two branches (indicated by \u00b1):\nA\u00b1\n0 (v)\n\n=\n\nr\n\n1\n3\n[1 \u2212 c(v)] + [1 + c(v)]\u039e2\u00b1 (v)\n2\n2\n\n\u03b1\u00b1 (v) = Erf(v)/[1 \u2212 \u039e\u00b1 (v)\n\np\n\np\n\n2/\u03c0]\n\n(142)\n(143)\n\nWe must demand 0 \u2264 \u039e\u00b1 (v) \u2264 \u03c0/2, to guarantee \u03c7R > 0, and [2\u2212U (v)]2 +2\u03c0[U (v)\u22121] \u2265 0,\nto ensure \u039e\u00b1 (v) \u2208 IR. We have now found the \u03c7 \u2192 \u221e transition line for both A20 < 32 (1 \u2212 c)\n(in the non-remanent region, where it is independent of A0 ), and for 32 (1 \u2212 c) < A20 <\n3\n(1\u2212c) + 14 \u03c0(1+c) (in the remanent region, where it depends on A0 ). At the moment where\n2\nA20 = 32 (1\u2212c) + 14 \u03c0(1+c), the bid susceptibility \u03c7R goes through zero, marking a switch to\nmajority game behavior; we find below that this occurs for the + branch at v = 0.\nTo aid and test numerical evaluation it will be helpful to assess the limits v \u2192 0\nand v \u2192 \u221e of the above parametrized branches. For small v one finds, using Erf(v) =\n\u221a\n(2v/ \u03c0)[1 \u2212 13 v 2 + O(v 4 )] and the fact that \u039e(v) cannot be negative,\nc(v)\n\n4v\n= \u03c3 2 [\u221e][1\u2212 \u221a ] + O(v 3 ),\n3 \u03c0\n\n\u039e+ (v) =\nHence\n\nq\n\nU (v) =\n\n\u03c3 2 [\u221e]\n\u221a + O(1)\nv[1+\u03c3 2 [\u221e]] \u03c0\n\n\u03c0\nv[1+\u03c3 2 [\u221e]]\u03c0(\u03c0\u22122)\n\u221a\n\u2212\n+ O(v 2 )\n2\n2\u03c3 2 [\u221e] 2\n\nlim\n\nv\u21920\n\nA+\n0 (v)\n\n=\n\nlim \u03b1+ (v) =\n\nv\u21920\n\nr\n\n(144)\n(145)\n\n\u03c0\n3\n[1 \u2212 \u03c3 2 [\u221e]] + [1 + \u03c3 2 [\u221e]]\n2\n4\n4\u03c3 2 [\u221e]\n\n(146)\n(147)\n\n[1+\u03c3 2 [\u221e]]\u03c0(\u03c0\u22122)\n\nFor \u03c3[\u221e] = 1 (no\np decision noise) this gives limv\u21920 \u03b1+ (v) = 2/\u03c0(\u03c0 \u2212 2) \u2248 0.5577 and\n(v)\n=\nlimv\u21920 A+\n\u03c0/2 \u2248 1.2533.

Phase diagrams for the models with F [A] = \u03c4 A[1 \u2212 A2 /A20 ],\n\u03c4 = \u00b11. Solid lines: \u03c7 = \u221e transition, dashed lines: remanence onset transition,\ndotted lines: \u03c7R = 0 (minority-to-majority) transition. The MinGame phase is\ncharacterized by \u03c7R > 0 (contrarian trading), the MajGame phase by \u03c7R < 0\n(trend-following). R indicates remanence. In the left picture (\u03c4 = \u22121, giving\ntrend-following for |A| < A0 and contrarian trading for |A| > A0 ), the phase\ndiagram is reasonably complete and reliable. For small A0 we have only the\nMinGame phase, with the standard \u03c7 \u2192 \u221e transition at \u03b1c \u2248 0.3374. As A0 is\nincreased a small remanent region is formed, until we switch to a MajGame state\nfor large A0 . In the right picture (\u03c4 = 1, giving contrarian trading for |A| < A0\nand trend-following for |A| > A0 ), we find the MinGame phase, with the standard\n\u03c7 \u2192 \u221e transition at \u03b1c \u2248 0.3374, for large A0 (as expected). However, the overall\npicture is now more uncertain since most of the diagram is remanent. Since we\ncan never be sure of picking the right solution in the remanent phase, the location\nof the \u03c7R = 0 line cannot be taken as certain, and indeed intuition suggests that\nit should have connected to the point where the \u03c7 = \u221e and the remanence onset\nlines meet. In both diagrams we cannot draw the line separating the non-ergodic\nMinGame phase from the MajGame phase for small \u03b1; as this line involves nonergodic phases, we have no access to it with a theory that assumes ergodicity.\n\n8 3\nx + O(x5 ) for q > 0, and\nIn the limit \u03bb \u2192 \u221e we use the expansions \u03a9(x) = 32 x \u2212 81\n\u221a\n\u221a\n3\n1\n3 2\n\u03a9(x) = 3 + 3 x \u2212 18 x + O(x ) for q < 0.

In practice we find no such points for \u03c4 = \u22121, irrespective of q.\n\n6.5. Phase diagrams\nWe can now summarize the picture obtained by analyzing time-translation invariant states\nin terms of a phase diagram. The control parameters are \u03b1 \u2265 0, A0 \u2265 0 and \u03c4 = \u00b11. We\nhave so far identified three transition types: \u03c7 \u2192 \u221e, \u03c7R \u2192 0 and q \u2192 0.

Simulation results for the persistent correlations c, the fraction of\nfrozen agents \u03c6, and the volatility \u03c3, for \u03c4 = \u22121 (i.e. F [A] = \u2212A + A3 /A20 ). The\nchosen values of A\u22121\nshould, according to the phase diagram, probe the region\n0\nclose where a A0 -dependent \u03c7 = \u221e transition occurs (indicated with a vertical\ndashed line), with a MinGame phase for large \u03b1. Full markers: tabula rasa initial\nconditions; empty markers: biased initial conditions.\n\nreproduce a majority-game type state for large A0 (top row), but as A0 is reduced (middle\nand bottom rows) the system exhibits behaviour that is less clear-cut than what is suggested\nby the phase diagram. We are still in the non-remanent region, so this cannot be explained\nby remanence effects. Close to the remanent region R of the \u03c4 = \u22121 phase diagram, the\nsimulations are in rough agreement with the predictions, see figure 8. The vertical dashed\nline marks the \u03c7 = \u221e transition, and seems to agree with simulations within the finite size\nlimitations. In figure 9 we probe the region where we expect MG-type behaviour. This is\nborne out in the ergodic region, for \u03b1 > \u03b1c (and the transition is found in the right place,\nin agreement with the phase diagram). However, for \u03b1 < \u03b1c the behaviour is found to be\nfar from typical; in contrast to the standard MG, the differences between the biased and\nunbiased initial conditions are small, and more likely to result of instabilities than long-term\nmemory. In fact one notes similarities in behavior with figure 4 for F [A] = sgn(A)|A|\u03b3 with\ngets larger, the first term of the\n\u03b3 = 4, 5; this suggest as a possible explanation that if A\u22121\n0\npresent F [A] = A3 /A20 \u2212A plays a role similar to sgn(A)|A|\u03b3 with \u03b3 \u2265 4.\nIn figure 10 we present simulation results for the most difficult case \u03c4 = 1, i.e.\nF [A] = A \u2212 A3 /A20 .

Discussion\nMinority-game type models have an amazing ability to describe new phenomena within an\naccessible mathematical framework, and to throw up new mathematical surprises and puzzles.\nIn this paper we have studied generalized agent-based market models of the MG-type (in their\nso-called 'fake history' batch version), in which the agents' strategy valuation update rule\nis allowed to depend on the overall market bid, via an impact function F [A] (which would\nbe F [A] = \u00b1A for the standard minority and majority games, respectively). The function\nF [A] allows us to model the effect of agents' interpretation of the state of the market (the\nmagnitude of the fluctuations), assuming that whether price fluctuations are perceived to be\nlarge or small should somehow influence how agents trade in financial markets. Our motive is\nto incorporate into solvable market models such behavioral elements. In this study we focus\non two model classes: one in which agents are always contrarians, but where we can control\ntheir greed and willingness to take risks, viz. F [A] = sgn(A)|A|\u03b3 , and one in which agents\ncan switch between trend following and contrarian trading, viz. F [A] = \u00b1A[1 \u2212 A2 /A20 ],\nsomewhat reminiscent of how they would adapt to booming and 'bear' markets.\nAt a mathematical level, the generating functional analysis of the present class of models\nrequires studying the overall bid evolution explicitly, similar to how one would study models\nwith real market history. It turns out that a key issue in working towards closed self consistent\nequations for persistent order parameters is whether the overall bid process is remanent. In\nnon-remanent cases, such as F [A] = sgn(A)|A|\u03b3 , solution is direct and relatively easy, and\nthe agreement between theory and simulations is excellent (for this particular model: unless\n\u03b3 becomes too large, where we lose the ergodic phase altogether). In remanent cases, such\nas F [A] = \u03c4 A[1 \u2212 A2 /A20 ] with \u03c4 = \u00b11, we need to rely on ans\u00e4tze and Maxwell-type\napproximations to select a solution from the possible stationary states, especially for \u03c4 = 1,\nand the agreement between theory and experiment is consequently limited.\nOnce more, what appear at first sight to be simple modifications of the standard MG lead\nto highly nontrivial and unexpected behaviour (even in batch models with fake histories). As\nsoon as agents are allowed to adapt their trading style to the magnitude of the fluctuations,\nin the spirit of [11], one introduces a non-trivial effective overall bid process, with new\ninstabilities and new transitions. We are now approaching the point where theories based on\npersistent order parameter equations only, the ones that benefit most from the simplifications\ninduced by having 'frozen agents', are no longer giving us the information we need. In models\ndominated by remanence, which are the type one needs when including more realistic agent\nbehaviour, we can no longer avoid solving the full dynamics more explicitly.\n\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n\nChallet D and Zhang Y-C 1997 Physica A 246 407-418\nChallet D and Zhang Y-C 1998 Physica A 256 514-532\nArthur W B 1994 Am.

Scaling of overall market bid covariances\nWe defined the overall bid covariance matrix as \u039ett\u2032 (z) = h\u00c3(t, z)\u00c3(t\u2032 , z)i. It must be timetranslation invariant, so we write \u039e(t, z) = \u039es+t,s (z), i.e. \u039e(t, z) = h\u00c3(s, z)\u00c3(t + s, z)i. From\n(78) we extract:\no\nn\nX\n1\n\u039e(t, z) = C\u0303(t) \u2212\nG(s) hF [A(z) + \u00c3(t\u2212s, z)]\u00c3(0, z)i + hF [A(z) + \u00c3(\u2212s, z)]\u00c3(t, z)i\n2\ns\n\n\u2212\n\nX\nss\u2032\n\nn\n\n2\n\no\n\nG(s)G(s\u2032 )h F [A(z) + \u00c3(t \u2212 s, z)]F [A(z) + \u00c3(\u2212s\u2032 , z)] \u2212 F (z) i\n\n(A.1)\n\nSince the non-persistent bids are Gaussian this equation gives an explicit relation from which\nto solve their covariances; along the lines of [15] we apply the general relation\nhG[\u00c3(t, z), \u00c3(t\u2032 , z)]i =\n\nZ\n\nDxDy\n\n(A.2)\n\n\u0002 x p\n\u0003\ny p\nx p\ny p\n\u00d7G \u221a\nS1 (t \u2212 t\u2032 ) + \u221a\nS2 (t \u2212 t\u2032 ), \u221a\nS1 (t \u2212 t\u2032 ) \u2212 \u221a\nS2 (t \u2212 t\u2032 )]\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\nwhere S1 (t \u2212 t\u2032 ) = \u039e(0, z)+\u039e(t\u2212t\u2032, z), S2 (t \u2212 t\u2032 ) = \u039e(0, z)\u2212\u039e(t\u2212t\u2032, z).

We know from earlier MG work (especially\nfrom approximate calculations of the volatility, see e.g. [8]) that the relaxation of the response\n\n\fTheory of agent-based market models with controlled levels of greed and anxiety\n\n30\n\nfunction G is very slow. Upon making an ansatz of the form G(t) = \u03c7(e\u03bc \u2212 1)e\u2212\u03bct one can\nshow that in the stationary state one must put \u03bc \u2192 0 (the relaxation time seems to diverge\nwith\nway). For such an exponential ansatz one would find\nP N in an as yet undetermined\n2 \u2212\u03bc|t| \u03bc\n\u03bc\nG(s)G(s\n\u2212\nt)\n=\n\u03c7\ne\n(e\n\u2212\n1)/(e\n+ 1) = O(\u03bc\u03c72 ). Thus if \u03bc \u2192 0 the second term\ns>0\nin (A.7) vanishes in the ergodic regime. In the final term we use our earlier ansatz that the\ncorrelations \u039e(s) decay on short times; formula (A.7) suggests that this relaxation time will\nbe that of C\u0303(t). If this relaxation time is \u03c4C , we may estimate the scaling of the last term in\n(A.7) as O(\u03bc\u03c4C \u03c72 ). So, upon writing the relaxation time of the response function as \u03c4G , we\nmay replace \u03bc \u2192 1/\u03c4G and write (A.7) as\n\u039e(t, z) =\n\n1\n2\nC\u0303(t) \u2212 F \u2032 (z)O(\u03c4C /\u03c4G ) \u2212 F 2 (z) \u2212 F (z) O(1/\u03c4G )\n2\n\nh\n\ni2\n\n\u2212 F \u2032 (z) O(\u03c4C /\u03c4G )\n\nh\n\ni\n\n(A.8)\n\n\f"}
