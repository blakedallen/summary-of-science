It is demonstrated that this requires to consider theories that differ from the JordanFierz-Brans-Dicke theory and that involve either a steep coupling function or a steep potential. It\nis also shown how a robust measurement of w could probe scalar-tensor theories.\nPACS numbers: 98.80.Cq, 05.50+h.98.80.Es\n\nVarious observations indicate that the expansion of our\nUniverse is presently accelerated [1]. While still debated,\nthis conclusion appears to be more and more robust and,\nas a consequence, the discussion has now mainly shifted\nto explaining the cause of this acceleration. The property\nof the effective equation of state inferred from the observations, w, is a key issue in this investigation. In particular, showing that w 6= \u22121 and/or dw/dz 6= 0 (z being the\nredshift) would exclude a cosmological constant, probably the most natural candidate and, hence, would have\ndrastic implications for fundamental physics. Recently,\nvarious observations have pointed towards the conclusion that w < \u22121 [2]. Although far from being settled,\nthis would also have important consequences since such\nan equation of state cannot be achieved by quintessence\nmodels [3] for which \u22121 \u2264 w \u2264 1. \"Phantom models\" [4],\nconsisting in a scalar field with a minus sign in front of the\nkinetic term, are very often advocated in order to explain\nw < \u22121. These models are plagued by various theoretical problems such as, for instance, their stability when\ninteractions with other fields are taken into account.\nHowever, another route can be investigated since theories where the gravity sector is modified, i.e. where gravity is no longer described by general relativity (GR), can\nalso entertain w < \u22121 even if the matter sector is described in a standard fashion. The prototype of such a\ntheory is a scalar-tensor theory of gravity which is both\nwell-defined and well-motivated [5] as they arise as the\nlow energy limit of string theory. It is worth recalling\nthat they are equivalent to theories where the gravitational action is given by an arbitrary function of the Ricci\nscalar and also encompass the Jordan-Fierz-Brans-Dicke\n(JFBD) theory as a particular case. As already mentioned, having 1 + w negative is linked to the fact that\nthe gravity sector is modified but such modifications are\nstrongly constrained by solar system and pulsars timing\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: jmartin@iap.fr\naddress: schimd@iap.fr\n\u2021 Electronic address: uzan@iap.fr\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nexperiments. Therefore, one can hope to use these local\ntests to track the real nature of the dark sector. In this\nletter, we investigate these issues in general scalar-tensor\ntheories.\nIn the Jordan frame, i.e. in the (physical) frame where\nthe experimental data have their usual interpretation,\nscalar-tensor theories are described by the action [6]\nZ\n\u221a \u0002\n1\nd4 x \u2212g F (\u03c6) R \u2212 Z (\u03c6) g \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6\nS =\n16\u03c0G\u2217\n\u0003\n\u22122U (\u03c6) + Sm [\u03a8m , g\u03bc\u03bd ] ,\n(1)\n\nwhich depends on three arbitrary functions F (\u03c6), Z (\u03c6)\nand the potential U (\u03c6), only two of which are independent. G\u2217 is a constant, different from the gravitational\nconstant measured in a Cavendish experiment, Gcav , as\nwill be discussed in more details below. In the following,\nthe matter action, Sm [\u03a8m , g\u03bc\u03bd ], describes a pressure-less\nperfect fluid.\nIn the particular case of a Friedmann-Lema\u00eetreRoberston-Walker (FLRW) Universe, choosing Z (\u03c6) =\n1, the field equations reduce to\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c1\n\u03c6\u03072\n\u1e1e\nU\nK\n2\n\u2212 3H + , (2)\n3 H + 2 = 8\u03c0G\u2217 m +\na\nF\n2F\nF\nF\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\n\u03c6\u0307\n\u00e4\nK\nF\u0308\n\u1e1e\nU\n\u2212 2 + H2 + 2 =\n+ + 2H \u2212 , (3)\na\na\n2F\nF\nF\nF\nwith H \u2261 \u0227/a, a being the scale factor and K the\ncurvature of the spatial sections. The energy density\nof matter scales as a\u22123 . These equations should be\ncompared to 3(H 2 +\u0001K/a2 ) = 8\u03c0Gcav (\u03c1m + \u03c1DE ) and\n\u2212 2\u00e4/a + H 2 + K/a2 = 8\u03c0Gcav pDE , since the equation of state of dark energy is experimentally inferred\nfrom the expansion history of the Universe by using the\nstandard Friedmann equations of GR. It follows that\n3\u03a9DE w \u2261 \u22121 + \u03a9K + 2q where q \u2261 \u2212a\u00e4/(\u0227)2 is the\nacceleration parameter, \u03a9K \u2261 \u2212K/a2 H 2 and that the\ndark energy density parameter is defined as \u03a9DE (z) \u2261\nH 2 /H02 \u2212 \u03a90m (1 + z)3 \u2212 \u03a90K (1 + z)2 , where here and in the\nrest of this letter the subscript \"0\" denotes the present\nday value of the corresponding quantity. Clearly, identifying \u03c1DE and pDE from Eqs. (2) and (3) leads to the\n\n\f2\nconclusion that, in scalar-tensor theories, w needs not to\nbe positive definite, depending on the choice of F . This\nwas already stressed by various works [7] and worked out\nin the particular case of JFBD theories in Refs. [8].\nThe present values of F and its derivatives are constrained by the solar system and pulsars experiments.\nIn order to reveal the link between w and these constraints, it is more convenient to work in the Einstein\n\u2217\nframe. The Einstein frame metric, g\u03bc\u03bd\n(all Einstein frame\nquantities will be denoted with a star), is related to the\nphysical metric through the conformal transformation\n\u2217\ng\u03bc\u03bd\n= F (\u03c6) g\u03bc\u03bd . Setting F (\u03c6) = A\u22122 (\u03c6\u2217 ), the scale\nfactors and cosmic times in both frames are related by\na = Aa\u2217 and dt = Adt\u2217 , so that the Hubble parameters\nare linked by AH = H\u2217 (1 + \u03b1\u03c6\u2032\u2217 ) with H\u2217 = d ln a\u2217 /dt\u2217\nand where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to\nthe Einstein frame number of e-folds, N\u2217 \u2261 ln(a\u2217 /a\u22170 ).\nDeviations from GR are usually described by two parameters, \u03b1 and \u03b2, which are the first and second field\nderivative of the coupling function A(\u03c6\u2217 ), namely\n\u03b1\u2261\n\nd ln A\n,\nd\u03c6\u2217\n\n\u03b2\u2261\n\nd\u03b1\n.\nd\u03c6\u2217\n\n(4)\n\nIn this framework, GR is characterized by \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 0\nwhile the JFBD theory corresponds to a constant \u03b12 \u2261\n(2\u03c9BD + 3)\u22121 and \u03b2 = 0. As mentioned before, in\nscalar-tensor theories, the Newton constant obtained in\n\n3\u03a9DE w = \u22121 + \u03a9K + (1 +\n\n\u03b1\u03c6\u2032\u2217 )\n\n\u0014\n\na Cavendish experiment differs from G\u2217 and is given by\nGcav = G\u2217 A20 (1 + \u03b120 ) .\n\n(5)\n\nThe parameters \u03b10 and \u03b20 are constrained by various experiments. If we define \u03b3\u0304 \u2261 \u03b3 PPN \u2212 1 and \u03b2\u0304 \u2261 \u03b2 PPN \u2212 1,\nwhere \u03b3 PPN and \u03b2 PPN are the post-Newtonian parameters [9], related to \u03b10 and \u03b20 by \u03b3\u0304 = \u22122\u03b120 /(1 + \u03b120 ) and\n2\u03b2\u0304 = \u03b20 \u03b120 /(1 + \u03b120 )2 , then the perihelion shift of Mercury implies 2\u03b3\u0304 \u2212 \u03b2\u0304 < 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 while the Lunar Laser\nRanging experiment sets 4\u03b2\u0304 \u2212 \u03b3\u0304 = \u2212(0.7 \u00b1 1) \u00d7 10\u22123 .\nOn the other hand, a bound on \u03b3\u0304 alone is set from the\ntime delay variation to the Cassini spacecraft near solar\nconjunction, namely \u03b3\u0304 = (2.1 \u00b1 2.3) \u00d7 10\u22125 , see Ref. [10]\nfor a review. We conclude that\n\u03b120 < 10\u22125 ,\n\n\u03b20 & \u22124.5 ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the lower bound on \u03b20 arises from pulsar timing\nexperiments [10]. Note, however, that we cannot consider arbitrarily large values of \u03b20 since then the postNewtonian approximation scheme would breakdown. In\nthis case, the upper constraints should be reanalyzed.

Indeed, in the Einstein frame,\nthe Friedmann equation reads [6]\n\u0001\nK\nH\u22172 3 \u2212 \u03c6\u20322\n(8)\n\u2217 = \u22123 2 + 8\u03c0G\u2217 \u03c1m\u2217 + 2V (\u03c6\u2217 ) ,\na\u2217\n\nwhere V (\u03c6\u2217 ) = U/(2F 2 ), and the positivity\n\u221a of the energy\ndensity of matter implies that |\u03c6\u2032\u2217 | < 3, as long as\n\u03a9K \u226a \u03a9m (in the following, we assume that \u03a9K = 0).\nThe expression (7) for w is completely general but very\nintricate and hence not so illuminating. However, taking\ninto account that\n\u03c6\u2032\u2217 has to\n\u221a \u03b10 has to be small and that\n\u2032\nbe bounded by 3 and, therefore, that \u03b10 \u03c6\u22170 has to be\nsmall as well, the present day value of the equation of\nstate simplifies considerably and reduces to\n\u2032\u2032\n3\u03a90DE (1 + w0 ) \u2243 2(1 \u2212 \u03b20 )\u03c6\u20322\n\u22170 \u2212 2\u03b10 \u03c6\u22170 .\n\n(9)\n\nThis formula turns out to be our main result. The contribution of \u03b20 arises from the term F\u0308 /F in the right hand\n\nside of Eq. (3). In fact, Eq. (9) shows that w0 < \u22121\nis always possible provided \u03b20 > 1 (in this case, even if\nthe slow-roll approximation is satisfied, i.e. \u03c6\u2032\u2032\u22170 \u226a \u03c6\u2032\u22170 )\nand/or \u03b1\u03c6\u2032\u2032\u22170 positive and large compared to \u03c6\u20322\n\u22170 . Both\nregimes cannot be reached in the case of JFBD theories\n(except if the time variation of Gcav is large, see below)\nand exist even in the limit \u03b10 \u2192 0 so that all local tests\ncan be satisfied.\nThe amplitude of w0 depends on the value of \u03c6\u2032\u22170 and\n\u03c6\u2032\u2032\u22170 . Independently of any dynamics, these two quantities\nare constrained by the bounds on the time variation of\nthe gravitational constant [11].

This\nimplies that |\u03be0 | . 5 \u00d7 108 h\u22121 \u03c30 \u223c 2.5 \u00d7 107 h\u22122 . Using\nEq.

As long as \u03b2 6= \u2212(1 + \u03b12 ), a case\nwe shall discuss later, one arrives at\n\u03c6\u2032\u2217 =\n\n\u03c3\n2\u03b1\n\n\u0012\n1+\n\n\u03c6\u2032\u2032\u2217 =\n\n\u03b2\n\u03c3\n\u2212\n1 + \u03b12\n2\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u001a \u0014\nd\u03b2\n2\u03b1\u03b2\n1\n\u03b2\n(1 + \u03b1\u03c6\u2032\u2217 )2\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2212\n\u03be\n\u2212\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n\u2212\n\u03b1\n+\n\u2217\n\u2217\n2\u03b1 [1 + \u03b2/ (1 + \u03b12 )]\n\u03b1\n1 + \u03b12 + \u03b2 d\u03c6\u2217\n1 + \u03b12\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u001b\n\u0014\n\u0012 2 2\n\u03a9m\nA /A0\n\u22122\n\u2212 1 \u2212 \u03c6\u20322\n+(1 + \u03b1\u03c6\u2032\u2217 )2 \u03a9DE \u2212 3\n\u2217 .\n2\n1 + \u03b10\n2\n\nInterestingly enough, we see that \u03c6\u2032\u2032\u22170 , and hence w0 , depends on \u03be0 and on the derivative of the \u03b2 function.\nThe latter is not constrained and we will assume that\nd\u03b2/d\u03c6\u2217 . O(100) for the same reason as for \u03b2. The\nabove formula is rather complicated but, given the previous constraints, we simply have\n\u03b1\u03c6\u2032\u2032\u2217\n\nwhile the second derivative reads\n\n\u03b2\n\u03be\n\u2212\n\u2243\n2\n2 + 2\u03b2/ (1 + \u03b1 ) 1 + \u03b2/ (1 + \u03b12 )\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b2 1 \u2212 \u03b12\n\u03c6\u20322\n\u00d7 1+\n\u2217 .\n1 + \u03b12 1 + \u03b12\n\n(13)\n\nIn particular, the unknown term d\u03b2/d\u03c6\u2217 does not appear\nin this approximation.\nAs mentioned above, the previous considerations are\nindependent from the dynamics. However, from a model\nbuilding point of view, \u03c6\u2032\u2032\u2217 and \u03c6\u2032\u2217 are not independent\nonce the potential V (\u03c6\u2217 ) is chosen. They are related\nthrough the Klein-Gordon equation which reads\n2(X + 1) \u2032\u2032\n\u03c6\u2217 + (2 + X)\u03c6\u2032\u2217 = \u2212(\u03b1X + \u03b1v ) ,\n3 \u2212 \u03c6\u20322\n\u2217\n\n(14)\n\nwith X \u2261 \u03a9m /\u03a9U , where \u03c1U \u2261 2U/(16\u03c0G\u2217 ) and \u03b1v \u2261\nd ln V /d\u03c6\u2217 . When the kinetic energy of the scalar field is\nnegligible, we have \u03a9U \u223c \u03a9DE .\nWe now come back to our master equation (9) and analyze the two regimes where 1 + w0 can become negative\nand even large (in absolute value). The first regime is\nthe natural extension of quintessence models to scalartensor theories [12] and corresponds to the situation in\nwhich the field is decelerating, i.e. \u03c6\u2032\u2032\u22170 \u226a \u03c6\u2032\u22170 , so that\n\u03b10 \u03c6\u2032\u2032\u22170 is negligible in Eq. (9). Clearly, this requires\n\u03b20 > 1. Such a regime, that cannot be reached in a\nJFBD model, has the advantage to exhibit an attraction\nmechanism toward GR [13] so that \u03b10 can dynamically\nbe made small. Since, in this situation, \u03b20 is not close\nto \u22121, Eq. (11) implies that \u03c6\u2032\u22170 \u223c \u03c30 /[2\u03b10 (1 + \u03b20 )] and\nEq. (13) leads to \u03be0 \u223c \u03b20 \u03c302 /[2\u03b120 (1 + \u03b20 )]. On the other\nhand, from the Klein-Gordon equation, one obtains that\n\u03c6\u2032\u22170 \u223c \u2212(\u03b10 X0 +\u221a\n\u03b1v0 )/(2 + X0 ) and, in order to fulfill the\ncondition \u03c6\u2032\u22170 < 3, one must have |\u03b1v0 | . 4.2. The two\n\n(12)\n\nexpressions for \u03c6\u2032\u22170 can be used to infer what \u03b20 is and,\nif we insert the result in Eq. (9), one gets\n3\u03a90DE (1 + w0 ) \u2243\n\n\u03c30 \u03b1v0\n< 0,\n(2 + X0 )\u03b10\n\n(15)\n\nin the most interesting limit where \u03b1v0 \u226b \u03b10 X0 since,\notherwise, |1 + w0 | \u223c O(\u03b120 ). They are two ways to interpret Eq. (15). Either it gives w0 in terms of \u03b10 and \u03b1v0 ,\nassuming that \u03c30 is known. Or it provides, for fixed \u03b10\nand \u03b1v0 , the minimum value that w0 can reach assuming, as is the case now, that only an upper bound on \u03c30 is\navailable. Fig. 1 depicts the above-mentioned minimum\nvalue as a function of (\u03b10 , \u03b1v0 ).\nAt this point several remarks are in order. Firstly,\nit is unclear whether the above situation can be realized without some fine-tuning in a realistic model, where\nboth the coupling function and the potential are running\naway in order to have attraction towards GR and insensitivity to the initial conditions [14]. Let us illustrate\nthis point on the following particular example. Consider\nthe case where \u03b1 \u221d e\u2212\u03bb\u03c6\u2217 so that \u03b20 = \u2212\u03b10 \u03bb. Since\nwe need \u03b10 \u226a 1 and, at the same time, \u03b20 > 1, this\nmeans that \u03bb \u226b 1 which may be considered as unnatural. Secondly, one can reverse the logics and study what\na detection of w0 < \u22121 would imply on scalar-tensor\ntheories (assuming, of course, that a slow-rolling \u03c6\u2217 is\ncausing the acceleration of the expansion). Besides the\nfact that the condition \u03b20 > 1 would drastically improve\nthe current limit on \u03b20 and, in particular, exclude GR,\nit is also interesting to remark that this would link w0\nto the time variation of the Newton constant through\nthe expressions \u03c302 \u2243 6\u03a90DE (1 + w0 )(1 + \u03b20 )2 \u03b120 /(1 \u2212 \u03b20 )\nand \u03be0 \u223c 3\u03a90DE \u03b20 (\u03b20 + 1)(w0 + 1)/(1 \u2212 \u03b20 ) . 6 \u00d7 102 , a\nlimit sharper than the bound set by local experiments.\nFinally, it is interesting to notice that w0 < \u22121 can be\nobtained even if the potential energy is negligible (in GR\nthis would correspond to w0 \u223c 1). In this case, one\ncan show that \u03c6\u2032\u22170 \u223c (3\u03a90DE )1/2 and \u03c6\u2032\u2032\u22170 \u223c \u22123\u03a90m \u03c6\u2032\u22170 /2\nso that \u03b10 \u03c6\u2032\u2032\u22170 is indeed negligible in Eq. (9). Then,\nthe equation of state can easily be obtained and reads\n1 + w0 \u223c 2(1 \u2212 \u03b20 ). Again \u03b20pis bounded by the constraint on \u03c30 , 1 + \u03b20 < \u03c30 /(\u03b10 12\u03a90DE ), so that a large\n\n\f4\n\n-1\n-1.5\n\nw 0 min\n\n-2\n-2.5\n-3\n-3.4\n\n0\n-3.6\n\n-1\n-2\n\n-3.8\n\nlog10 \u03910\n\n-3\n\n\u0391V0\n\n-4\n-4\n\nFIG. 1: Minimum value of w0 as a function of (\u03b10 , \u03b1v0 ) for\n\u03c30 < 10\u22123 .\n\nvalue of w0 requires \u03c30 \u226a \u03b10 .\nThe second regime corresponds to the case where \u03b1\u03c6\u2032\u2032\u2217\ndominates in Eq. (9). As can be seen in Eq. (13), this\nis possible if \u03be0 is large and positive and/or if \u03b20 \u223c \u22121.\nStrictly speaking, one should in fact consider the limit\n\u03b20 \u2192 \u2212(1 + \u03b120 ) corresponding, when V = 0, to the\nBarker theory [15] in which A = cos \u03c6\u2217 and Gcav constant (\u03c3 = \u03be = 0, whatever the value of \u03c6\u2032\u2217 and \u03c6\u2032\u2032\u2217 ).\nSince \u03b1 = \u2212 tan \u03c6\u2217 , the cosmological evolution drives the\ntheory away from GR unless a potential keeps \u03c6\u2217 close\nto 0 until the last e-folds inducing a large variation of\n\u03b1\u03c6\u2032\u2032\u2217 \u223c O(1) in order to have 1 + w0 < 0. Such a model\nseems very contrived unless the potential exhibits a slope\ndiscontinuity recently.\nLet us now assume that \u03be0 \u223c 0 since, from dimensional analysis, one expects \u03be0 \u223c \u03c302 . 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 . In\nthe limit \u03b20 \u2192 \u22121 \u2212 \u03b120 , Eq. (13) leads to \u03b1\u03c6\u2032\u2032\u22170 \u223c\n2\n2\u03b120 \u03b202 \u03c6\u20322\n\u22170 /(1 + \u03b20 + \u03b10 ) and w0 diverges\n\u221a when \u03b20 \u2192\n2\n\u22121 \u2212 \u03b10 . However, the constraint \u03c6\u2032\u2217 < 3 implies that\n\n[1] S. Perlmutter et al. , Nature (London) 391, 51 (1998);\nS. Perlmutter et al. , Astrophys. J. 517, 565 (1999);\nP. M.

Finally, let us see what this regime implies\nin terms of model building. The Klein-Gordon equation\nimplies that 2\u03c6\u2032\u2032\u22170 /3 \u223c \u2212\u03b1v0 /(2 + X0 ) so that the slope of\nthe potential must be very large, \u03b1v0 \u226b \u03b1\u22121\n0 . Moreover\nsince, in this regime, \u03b20 < 0 the theory is driven away\nfrom GR and it follows that the potential must be tuned\nin order to prevent this drift.\nAs a conclusion, let us summarize our main findings.\nFirstly, we have confirmed that 1 + w0 is not positive\ndefinite in scalar-tensor theories even if all the matter\nenergy conditions are satisfied. Secondly, we have established under which conditions 1+w0 can become negative\ngiven the local constraints coming from solar system and\npulsars measurements (in the case of chameleon models [16], it has been argued that \u03b10 can be of order unity\ntoday, a case where large negative values of 1 + w0 can\nbe achieved more easily). We have shown that getting\na non negligible deviation from \u22121 necessarily implies a\nnon vanishing \u03b20 (except if \u03be0 is large), a situation that\ncannot be reached in the JFBD case. Thirdly, in terms\nof model building, we have demonstrated that this corresponds either to \u03b20 > 1, a situation where the scalar\nfield is slow-rolling today and the coupling constant is\nvery steep or to \u03b20 \u223c \u22121 (or \u03be0 large) where the slope of\nthe potential is very large. Fourthly, we have also shown\nhow a measurement of w0 < \u22121 could improve the local\nconstraints on the deviations from GR. This highlights\nthe complementarity [17] between cosmological and local tests of gravity. Finally, let us remark that we have\nonly taken into account the local constraints. A next\nstep would be to reconstruct the redshift evolution of the\nmodels and to show that they are not pathological [6].\nAcknowledgments: we thank G.
