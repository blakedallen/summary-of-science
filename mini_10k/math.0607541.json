Introduction\nThis paper is devoted to the study of qualitative properties of the solutions to the full\nBoltzmann equation in the torus for a broad family of collision kernels. In this work we\nshall quantify the positivity of the solution by proving the \"immediate\" appearance of a\nstationary lower bound, uniform in space. Before we explain our results and methods in\nmore details let us introduce the problem in a precise way.\n1.1. Motivation. The Boltzmann equation decribes the behavior of a dilute gas; when\nwe assume periodic boundary conditions in space, it reads\n\u2202f\n+ v * \u2207x f = Q(f, f ),\n\u2202t\n\nx \u2208 TN ,\n1\n\nv \u2208 RN ,\n\nt \u2208 [0, T ),\n\n\f2\n\nCL\u00c9MENT MOUHOT\n\nwhere T \u2208 (0, +\u221e], TN is the N -dimensional torus, the unknown f = f (t, x, v) is a timeN\ndependent probability density on TN\nx \u00d7 Rv (N \u2265 2), and Q is the quadratic Boltzmann\ncollision operator. It is local in t and x and we define it by the bilinear form\nZ\nZ\nd\u03c3B(|v \u2212 v\u2217 |, cos \u03b8) (g\u2217\u2032 f \u2032 \u2212 g\u2217 f ).\ndv\u2217\nQ(g, f ) =\nRN\n\nHere we have used the shorthands\n\nSN\u22121\nf \u2032 = f (v \u2032 ),\n\ng\u2217 = g(v\u2217 ) and g\u2217\u2032 = g(v\u2217\u2032 ), where\n\nv + v\u2217 |v \u2212 v\u2217 |\nv + v \u2217 |v \u2212 v\u2217 |\n+\n\u03c3,\nv\u2217\u2032 =\n\u2212\n\u03c3\n2\n2\n2\n2\nstand for the pre-collisional velocities of particles which after collision have velocities v\nand v\u2217 . Moreover \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0] is the deviation angle between v \u2032 \u2212 v\u2217\u2032 and v \u2212 v\u2217 , and B is\nthe Boltzmann collision kernel (related to the cross-section \u03a3(v \u2212 v\u2217 , \u03c3) by the formula\nB = \u03a3|v \u2212 v\u2217 |), determined by physics. On physical\ngrounds,\nit is assumed that B \u2265 0\nE\nD\nv\u2212v\u2217\nand that B is a function of |v \u2212 v\u2217 | and cos \u03b8 = |v\u2212v\u2217 | , \u03c3 .\nIn this paper we shall be concerned with the case when B takes the following product\nform\nv\u2032 =\n\n(1.1)\n\nB(v \u2212 v\u2217 , \u03c3) = \u03a6(|v \u2212 v\u2217 |) b(cos \u03b8)\n\nwhere \u03a6 satisfies either the assumption\n(1.2)\n\n\u2200 z \u2208 R,\n\nor the mollified assumption\n\u001a\n\u2200 |z| \u2265 1,\n(1.3)\n\u2200 |z| \u2264 1,\n\nc\u03a6 |z|\u03b3 \u2264 \u03a6(z) \u2264 C\u03a6 |z|\u03b3\nc\u03a6 |z|\u03b3 \u2264 \u03a6(z) \u2264 C\u03a6 |z|\u03b3\nc\u03a6 \u2264 \u03a6(z) \u2264 C\u03a6\n\nwith c\u03a6 , C\u03a6 > 0 and \u03b3 \u2208 (\u2212N, 1], and b is a continuous function on \u03b8 \u2208 (0, \u03c0], strictly\npositive on \u03b8 \u2208 (0, \u03c0), such that\n(1.4)\n\nb(cos \u03b8) sinN \u22122 \u03b8 \u223c\u03b8\u21920+ b0 \u03b8 \u22121\u2212\u03bd\n\nfor some b0 > 0 and \u03bd \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, 2). The assumption (1.1) that B takes a tensorial form\nis made for the sake of convenience, since it is a well-accepted hypothesis which covers\nimportant physical cases. Most probably it could be relaxed to non-tensorial collision\nkernels with the same kind of controls, up to some technical refinements. The assumption\nthat b is strictly positive on \u03b8 \u2208 (0, \u03c0) is a technical requirement for Lemma 2.3 and\nLemma 2.4 in Section 2 and it could be relaxed to the requirement that b is strictly\npositive near \u03b8 \u223c \u03c0/2.\nFollowing the usual taxonomy we shall denote by \"hard potential\" collision kernels the\ncase when \u03b3 > 0, \"Maxwellian\" collision kernels the case when \u03b3 = 0, and \"soft potential\"\ncollision kernels the case when \u03b3 < 0. When \u03a6 satisfies assumption (1.3) and not (1.2)\nwe shall speak of \"mollified soft potentials\" collision kernels or \"mollified hard potentials\"\ncollision kernels. In the case when \u03bd < 0, the angular collision kernel is locally integrable,\nan assumption which is usually referred to as Grad's cutoff assumption (see [20]). Thus\n\n\fQUANTITATIVE LOWER BOUNDS FOR THE FULL BOLTZMANN EQUATION\n\n3\n\nfor \u03bd < 0 we shall speak of \"cutoff\" collision kernels, and for \u03bd \u2265 0 we shall speak of\n\"non-cutoff\" collision kernels.\nThe main cases of application are \"hard spheres\" interaction (b constant and \u03a6(z) =\n|z| which corresponds to the case \u03b3 = 1 and \u03bd = \u22121), and interactions deriving from\na 1/r s force (s > 2), where r is the distance between particles, which corresponds to\n\u03b3 = (s \u2212 5)/(s \u2212 1) and \u03bd = 2/(s \u2212 1) in dimension 3.\nIn the case when the solution f (t, v) does not depend on the space variable x, we shall\nspeak of spatially homogeneous solution.\nThe attempts to quantify the strict positivity of the solution to the Boltzmann equation\nare as old as the mathematical theory of the Boltzmann equation, since Carleman himself\nestablished such estimates in his pioneering paper [6]. He showed, for hard potentials with\ncutoff in dimension 3, that the spatially homogeneous solutions radially symmetric in v he\nN 1 (the very first result in the Cauchy theory) satisfy a lower\nhad constructed in L\u221e\n6 (Rv )\nbound of the form\n\u2200 t \u2265 t0 > 0, \u2200 v \u2208 R3\n\nf (t, v) \u2265 C1 e\u2212C2 |v|\n\n2+\u03b5\n\n,\n\nfor any fixed t0 > 0 and \u03b5 > 0. The constants C1 , C2 > 0 are uniform as t \u2192 +\u221e and\ndepend on t0 , \u03b5 and some estimates on the solution. The proof was based on a \"spreading\nproperty\" of the collision operator and the assumption that the initial datum is uniformly\nbounded from below by a positive quantity on a ball centered at the origin (in fact the\nweaker assumption of a lower bound on an annulus is sufficient, see [6]).\nThis result remained unchallenged until the paper from Pulvirenti and Wennberg [30].\nThey proved, for hard potentials with cutoff in dimension 3, that the spatially homoge2\nneous solutions in L12 (RN\nv ) with bounded entropy (see [3] and [28]) satisfy a lower bound\nof the form\n2\n\u2200 t \u2265 t0 > 0, \u2200 v \u2208 R3 f (t, v) \u2265 C1 e\u2212C2 |v| ,\nfor any fixed t0 > 0. Again C1 , C2 > 0 are uniform as t \u2192 +\u221e and depend on t0 and\nsome estimates on the solution. Their proof was also based on the spreading property of\nthe collision operator but the optimal decay of the lower bound was obtained by some\nimprovements of the computations. Moreover they made a clever use of the iterated gain\npart of the collision kernel in order to establish the immediate appearance of a positive\nminoration of the solution on a ball, thus getting rid of the assumption of Carleman on\nthe initial datum. This paper is the starting point of our study.\nTwo other methods should be mentioned.\nOn one hand, Fournier [15, 17] established by delicate probabilistic techniques that\nthe spatially homogeneous solutions to the Kac equation without cutoff satisfy f (t, v) \u2208\nC \u221e ((0, +\u221e) \u00d7 RN ) and\n\u2200 t > 0, \u2200 v \u2208 RN , f (t, v) > 0.\nHe proved the same kind of result in [16] for the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation\nwithout cutoff in dimension 2 under technical restrictions.\n1see Subsection 1.4 for the notations\n2id.\n\n\f4\n\nCL\u00c9MENT MOUHOT\n\nOn the other hand there is a work in progress by Villani in order to establish lower\nbounds on the solution to the Boltzmann equation using suitable maximum principles.\nThe most important feature of this new method is that it applies to the non-cutoff case.\nFor more explanations we refer to [36, Chapter 2, Section 6]. This method has been able to\nrecover more simply the results by Fournier, and a quantitative lower bound is in progress.\nWe also refer to the work [18] which proves with the same tools the propagation of upper\nMaxwellian bounds for the spatially homogeneous solutions to the Boltzmann equation\nfor hard spheres.\nFinally we note that in the case of the spatially homogeneous Landau equation with\nMaxwellian or hard potentials interactions, one can prove a theorem similar to that of\nPulvirenti and Wennberg by means of the standard maximum principle for parabolic\nequations, see [9]. Actually the result stated in this paper is not uniform as t \u2192 +\u221e, but\nit can be made uniform by the same argument as in the proof of Theorem 1.1 in Section 3\nbelow.\nThe study of lower bounds is of interest in itself, in order to understand the qualitative\nbehaviour of solutions to the Boltzmann equation. Moreover recently this interest has\nbeen renewed by the emergence of a new quantitave method in the study of convergence to\nequilibrium, the so-called \"entropy-entropy production\" method (see [31, 32, 10, 37]). This\nmethod requires indeed a control from below on the solution by a function decreasing at\nmost exponentially, and uniform in time. It has been applied lately to some inhomogeneous\nkinetic equations: see [11] for the Fokker-Planck equation and [12] for the full Boltzmann\nequation. For instance the main result in [12] asserts that any solution of the Boltzmann\nequation satisfying uniform estimates of smoothness and fast decay at large velocities,\ncombined with a lower bound like\n(1.5)\n\n\u2200 t \u2265 t0 > 0, \u2200 x \u2208 TN , \u2200 v \u2208 RN ,\n\nf (t, x, v) \u2265 C1 e\u2212C2 |v|\n\nK\n\nfor some C1 , C2 , K > 0, does converge to equilibrium at rate \"almost exponential\", i.e.\nfaster than any inverse power of t. This paper works in some a priori setting on the\nsolution, since there is no general Cauchy theory whose solutions satisfies suitable estimates\nto apply the \"entropy-entropy production\" method. Nevertheless a natural question is\nwether the set of solution satisfying the a priori assumptions of [12] is not trivial, i.e.\nreduced to the spatially homogeneous case or to cases for which exponential convergence\nresults are already known. Our study answers to this question, since the solutions in [21]\nsatisfy all the estimates of regularity and decay needed in [12], and a consequence of\nTheorem 1.1 below is that they also satisfy (1.5) (with K = 2).\n1.2. Statement of the results. Now let us introduce the functional spaces and the\nmacroscopic quantities on the solution. We define bounds uniform in space on the observables of the solutions. We shall study precisely in Section 5 in which case there is a Cauchy\ntheory which fits these assumptions. One can say briefly that they are satisfied at least\nfor hard spheres and inverse power laws interactions, either in the spatially homogeneous\nsetting, or in the spatially inhomogeneous setting for solutions \"in the small\" (i.e. for\nsmall time or near the equilibrium).\n\n\fQUANTITATIVE LOWER BOUNDS FOR THE FULL BOLTZMANN EQUATION\n\n5\n\nLet us consider a function f (t, x, v) \u2265 0 on [0, T ) \u00d7 TN \u00d7 RN .

The first one deals with cutoff collision kernels. In\nthis theorem a mild solution to the Boltzmann equation with initial datum f0 is a function\nf which satisfies (3.1) pointwise (see Definition 3.1 below).\nTheorem 1.1. Let B = \u03a6 b be a collision kernel which satisfies (1.1), with \u03a6 satisfying (1.2) or (1.3), and b satisfying (1.4) with \u03bd < 0. Let f (t, x, v) be a mild solution of\nthe full Boltzmann equation in the torus on some time interval [0, T ), T \u2208 (0, +\u221e] such\nthat\n(i) if \u03a6 satisfies (1.2) with \u03b3 \u2265 0 or if \u03a6 satisfies (1.3), then f satisfies (1.6);\n(ii) if \u03a6 satisfies (1.2) with \u03b3 < 0, then f satisfies (1.6) and (1.7).\nThen for all \u03c4 \u2208 (0, T ) there exists some \u03c1 > 0 and \u03b8 > 0 depending on \u03c4 , \u033af , Ef , Hf\np\n(and Lf\u03b3 if \u03a6 satisfies (1.2) with \u03b3 < 0), such that for all t \u2208 [\u03c4, T ) the solution is bounded\nfrom below by the uniform Maxwellian distribution with density \u03c1 and temperature \u03b8, i.e.\n|v|2\n\n(1.9)\n\nN\n\nN\n\n\u2200 t \u2208 [\u03c4, T ), \u2200 x \u2208 T , \u2200 v \u2208 R ,\n\ne\u2212 2\u03b8\n.\nf (t, x, v) \u2265 \u03c1\n(2\u03c0\u03b8)N/2\n\nRemarks: Let us comment on the assumptions and conclusions of this theorem:\n1. The main case of application of this theorem one should think of is B = |v \u2212\nv\u2217 |\u03b3 b(cos \u03b8) with b bounded from above and below. It includes the hard spheres model\n(when \u03b3 = 1 and b = 1), and the so-called \"variable hard spheres\" model.\n2. As the lower bound in (1.9) does not depend on the space variable x, Theorem 1.1\napplies to spatially homogeneous solutions as well: take f0 depending only on v and f (t, v)\nthe corresponding solution of the homogeneous Boltzmann equation, then f (t, v) is also a\nsolution of the inhomogeneous Boltzmann equation in the torus and Theorem 1.1 gives the\nappearance of a Maxwellian lower bound on the v variable. This theorem thus includes and\n\n\fQUANTITATIVE LOWER BOUNDS FOR THE FULL BOLTZMANN EQUATION\n\n7\n\nextends the previous result of Pulvirenti and Wennberg in [30], valid for hard potentials.\nIt gives new results for spatially homogeneous solutions in the case of soft potentials with\ncutoff (see Section 5).\n3. In the inhomogeneous case, Theorem 1.1 applies to the solutions of Ukai [33] near\nthe equilibrium for hard spheres, or to the solutions of Guo [21] near the equilibrium for\nsoft potentials with cutoff (see Section 5).\n4. More generally this theorem can be seen as an a priori result on the renormalized\nsolutions (see [14] and [8, Chapter 5]), the only theory of solutions in the large at now.\nFor instance for a gas of hard spheres in a torus, its converse says that if the solution f\nvanishes, then either the local density \u03c1f has to vanish somewhere in the torus, or the\nlocal density \u03c1f , energy ef or entropy hf have to blow-up somewhere in the torus.\nNow let us state the result we get for long-range interaction models, i.e. collision kernels\nwith an angular singularity. In this theorem a mild solution to the Boltzmann equation\nwith initial datum f0 is a function f which satisfies (4.3) pointwise (see Definition 4.1\nbelow).\nTheorem 1.2. Let B = \u03a6 b be a collision kernel which satisfies (1.1), with \u03a6 satisfying (1.2) or (1.3), and b satisfying (1.4) with \u03bd \u2208 [0, 2). Let f (t, x, v) be a mild solution of\nthe full Boltzmann equation in the torus on some time interval [0, T ), T \u2208 (0, +\u221e] such\nthat\n(i) if \u03a6 satisfies (1.2) with \u03b3 \u2265 0 or if \u03a6 satisfies (1.3), then f satisfies (1.6) and (1.8);\n(ii) if \u03a6 satisfies (1.2) with \u03b3 < 0, then f satisfies (1.6), (1.7) and (1.8).\nThen for all \u03c4 \u2208 (0, T ) and for any exponent K such that\n\u0011\n\u0010\n2\u03bd\nlog 2 + 2\u2212\u03bd\n,\nK>2\nlog 2\np\n\nthere exist C1 > 0 and C2 > 0 depending on \u03c4 , K, \u033af , Ef , Ef\u2032 , Hf , Wf (and Lf\u03b3 if \u03a6\nsatisfies (1.2) with \u03b3 < 0), such that\n\u2200 t \u2208 [\u03c4, T ), \u2200 x \u2208 TN , \u2200 v \u2208 RN ,\n\nK\n\nf (t, x, v) \u2265 C1 e\u2212C2 |v| .\n\nMoreover in the case when \u03bd = 0, one can take K = 2 (Maxwellian lower bound).\nRemarks: Let us comment on the assumptions and conclusions of this theorem:\n1. One can check that this theorem is consistent with Theorem 1.1 when \u03bd \u2192 0.\nNotice that the situation when \u03bd = 0 is particular: the collision operator is non-cutoff and\ncorresponds to some \"logarithmic derivative\".\n2. This theorem is, to the knowledge of the author, the first quantitative lower bound\nresult for non-cutoff collision kernels. It applies for instance to the spatially homogeneous\nsolutions recently obtained in [13] (see Section 5).\n3. We mention that an extension of Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.2 to the case of a\nbounded open set \u03a9 with specular reflection ou bounce-back boundary condition on \u2202\u03a9 is\nin progress, and will be treated in a second part of this work.\n\n\f8\n\nCL\u00c9MENT MOUHOT\n\n1.3. Methods of proof. In the spatially homogeneous case the proof of [30] proceeds\nin two steps: first the construction of an \"upheaval point\" for the solution after a small\ntime, i.e. a uniform minoration on a ball; second a \"spreading process\" of this bound\nfrom below after a small time by the collision process, iterated infinitely many times.\nBoth these steps are based on a mixing property of the gain part of the collision operator,\nwhich is reminiscent of the regularization property of this gain part, discovered by Lions\n(see [24, 25] or [36, Chapter 2, Section 3.4] for a review). The second step was already\npresent in [6] and systematically used in [30]. The main contributions of our paper are:\n(1) a strategy to deal with space dependent solutions (Section 3), based on an implementation of the \"upheaval\" and \"spreading\" steps along each caracteristic,\nkeeping track carefully of the constants in order to get uniform estimates according to the choice of the characteristic;\n(2) a strategy to deal with non cutoff collision kernels (Section 4), based on the use\nof a suitable splitting of the collision operator between a cutoff part which still\nenjoys the spreading property, and a small non-cutoff part, for which we give L\u221e\nestimates of smallness thanks to the regularity assumptions on the solution. A\nprecise balance between these two parts then allows to obtain the lower bound in\nthe non cutoff case, although slighlty weaker;\n(3) the implementation of the general method for soft potentials as well (i.e for collision\nkernels with a singular kinetic part), and in any dimension (Sections 3 and 4);\n(4) a detailed discussion of the connection between these results and the existing\nCauchy theories (Section 5).\nHere we adopt the point of view of an a priori setting which allows to treat separately the\nissue of the lower bound and the one of establishing a priori estimates on the solution.\nTherefore we do not adress the question of obtaining such a priori estimates in the general\ncase, which is open at now. This point of view should be understood as a unified approach\nfor all existing Cauchy theories, as well as a way to obtain a priori results when no Cauchy\ntheory exists, or when the solutions are too weak.\nThe paper runs as follows. Section 2 remains purely functional, Section 3 and 4 work\non arbitrary solutions in a priori setting, and only Section 5 deals with solutions which\nhave effectively been constructed by previous authors. Section 3 is devoted to the proof\nof Theorem 1.1, Section 4 to the proof of Theorem 1.2 and Section 5 applies these two\ntheorems to the existing Cauchy theories.\np\n1.4. Notation. In the sequel we shall denote h*i = 1 + | * |2 .

As a\nconvention, \"cst\" shall systematically denote any constant depending only on the dimension N , \u03b3, \u03bd and b0 . For a real x, we shall denote x+ the positive part of x and we recall\nthe shorthand \u03b3\u0303 = (2 + \u03b3)+ .\n\n2. Functional toolbox\nIn this section we shall gather functional tools useful for the sequel. On one hand,\nLemma 2.1, Lemma 2.5 are precised versions of well-known results adapted to our study:\nwe need L\u221e estimates whereas the usual framework of such estimates are integral spaces.\nOn the other hand, Lemma 2.3 and Lemma 2.4 are essentially generalizations of results\nin [30]. We extend these results for any cutoff potentials (in the sense of (1.2) and (1.4)\nwith \u03bd < 0), in any dimension. Moreover we intend to use these results in the context\nof spatially inhomogeneous solutions, using the fact that the collision operator is local in\nt and x, which allows to see these variables as parameters in the functional estimates.\nThus we shall track precisely the dependence of these estimates on the hydrodynamical\nquantities: \u03c1f , ef , e\u2032f , hf , lfp , wf .\n\n\f10\n\nCL\u00c9MENT MOUHOT\n\n2.1.

We did not follow this method which is less\ndirect, and leads to harder computations to track the exact dependence of the constant.\nNevertheless the remark emphasizes the fact that the mixing property used here on Q+\nis a linear one, which is consistent with the regularity theory for this operator (see the\nregularity theory of Q+ in the cutoff case in [29]).\nProof of Lemma 2.3. This lemma is a slight variant of [30, Lemma 3.1], whose proof can\nbe straightforwardly adapted here. Note that this proof was made assuming that b is\nbounded below by a positive quantity on the whole interval [0, \u03c0] but as pointed out\nin [30, Proof of Lemma 3.1] the proof still works the same under the sole assumption on\nb that it is bounded below by a positive quantity near \u03b8 \u223c \u03c0/2, which is satisfied under\nour assumptions on b.\nTherefore we only generalize the formula in the proof to any dimension and to any\npower \u03b3 of the collision kernel, and we precise the dependence of R0 , \u03b40 and \u03b70 according\nto the quantities \u03c1g , eg and hg .\n\n\f12\n\nCL\u00c9MENT MOUHOT\n\nFirst let us suppose that \u03a6 satisfies (1.2) with \u03b3 \u2265 0, in order to satisfy the assumptions\nof [30, Lemma 3.1].

The non-cutoff case. The two lemmas below will be useful in the treatment of\nnon-cutoff collisions kernels. They express the fact that non-grazing collisions constitute\nthe dominant term of the collision operator as long as \"spreading effect\" is concerned.\nThey are essentially based on the by now well-known idea of using symmetry-induced\ncancellations effects in order to deal with the angular singularity (see [35, 1, 2]).\nIn the case of non cutoff collision kernels, the usual Grad's splitting Q = Q+ \u2212 Q\u2212 does\nnot make sense anymore.

In the treatment of Q2 , the \"derivative-like\" difference (f \u2032 \u2212 f ) can be\ntransferred to the angular part of the collision kernel by a process of change of variable\nwhich plays the same role as integration by part for classical differential operators. One\ncan not do the same in Lemma 2.5 because there is no \"decoupling\" of the two arguments\nf and g.\n2. The proof of Lemma 2.5 is based on a similar idea as cancellation lemmas in [35, 1, 2].\nWe make a Taylor expansion of (f \u2032 \u2212 f ) for small deviation angles in order to compensate\nfor the grazing collision singularity of the collision kernel. However for smooth functions\nthe quantity (f \u2032 \u2212 f ) compensate only for a singularity of order 1. Thus one has to use\nthe symmetry of the collision sphere in order to compensate for strong singularities: to\ncompensate for a singularity of order 2, one has to kill the first order term of the Taylor\nexpansion of (f \u2032 \u2212 f ) by integrating on the (N \u2212 2)-dimensional sphere included in the\ncollision sphere which is orthogonal to the vector v \u2212 v\u2217 and contains v \u2032 .\n3. Note that Lemma 2.5 is reminiscent of [2, Proposition 4] which implies that the\ncomplete non cutoff operator Q satisfies the following inequality\nkQ(g, f )kW \u22122,1 \u2264 C kgkL1 kf kL1\n\u03b3\u0303\n\n\u03b3\u0303\n\nEssentially the difference is that Lemma 2.5 is intended to provide an L\u221e control. This\nis why it requires an Lp bound on the solution for soft potentials. The proof of [2,\nProposition 4] uses a duality argument and the pre-post collisional change of variable to\npass the \"derivative-like\" difference on the dual test function. The (N \u2212 2)-dimensional\nsphere on which cancellations occur does not appear explicitely in the representation\nformula as in our proof, but is rather implicit in a projection argument.

Proof of the lower bound in the cutoff case\nIn this section we shall prove Theorem 1.1. Since the collision operator is local in t and\nx, the idea of the proof is to apply first Lemma 2.3 and then Lemma 2.4 iterated on each\ncharacteristic of the free transport operator, in order first to obtain an upheaval point,\nand then to \"spread\" the minoration. It yields for each characteristic of the transport\nflow a Maxwellian lower bound with macroscopic velocity v\u0304, temperature \u03b8 and density\n\u03c1 depending on the characteristic. Then a uniform control on v\u0304, \u03b8 and \u03c1 yields the\nglobal Maxwellian lower bound. This control is based on the uniform bounds on the\nhydrodynamic quantities. The lower bound is also made uniform as t \u2192 +\u221e thanks to\nthese uniform bounds.\nThe main tool is the Duhamel representation formula, written along the characteristics\n(which reduce to lines in the case of periodic boundary conditions):\n\u2200 t \u2208 [0, T ), \u2200 x \u2208 TN , \u2200 v \u2208 RN ,\n\u0012 Z t\n\u0013\n(3.1) f (t, x + vt, v) = f0 (x, v) exp \u2212\nL[f (s, x + vs, *)](v) ds\n0\n\u0012 Z t\n\u0013\nZ t\nL[f (s\u2032 , x + vs\u2032 , *)](v) ds\u2032 Q+ [f (s, x + vs, *), f (s, x + vs, *)](v) ds\nexp \u2212\n+\n0\n\ns\n\nwhere L was defined in (2.1). We define the concept of solution we shall use in the cutoff\ncase, i.e. the concept of mild solutions (see [8, Section 5.3] for an analogous definition).\nDefinition 3.1. Let f0 be a measurable function non-negative almost everywhere on TN \u00d7\nRN . A measurable function f = f (t, x, v) on [0, T ) \u00d7 TN \u00d7 RN is a mild solution of the\nBoltzmann equation to the initial datum f0 (x, v) if for almost every (x, v) in TN \u00d7 RN :\nt 7\u2192 L[f (t, x + vt, *)](v),\n\nt 7\u2192 Q+ [f (t, x + vt, *), f (t, x + vt, *)](v)\n\nare in L1loc ([0; T )), and for each t \u2208 [0, T ), the equation (3.1) is satisfied and f (t, x, v) is\nnon-negative for almost every (x, v).\n\n\fQUANTITATIVE LOWER BOUNDS FOR THE FULL BOLTZMANN EQUATION\n\n19\n\nProposition 3.2.

Application to the existing Cauchy theories\nIn this section we shall use Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.2 to study solutions which have\nbeen constructed by previous authors, by connecting these theorems to some existing\nresults in the Cauchy theory of the Boltzmann equation.\nFirst we give a theorem which summarizes the situation in the spatially homogeneous\nsetting for cutoff potentials in cases where the collision kernel does not present a singularity\nfor vanishing relative velocity (a case which is not so well understood and for which Lp\nestimates have not yet been derived).\nTheorem 5.1. Let B = \u03a6 b be a collision kernel satisfying assumptions (1.1), with \u03a6\nsatisfying assumption (1.2) with \u03b3 \u2265 0 or (1.3), and b satisfying (1.4) with \u03bd < 0. Let f0\nbe a nonnegative initial condition on RN\nv with finite mass, energy. Then\n(i) there exists a unique solution f (t, v) with constant mass and energy to the spatially\nhomogeneous Boltzmann equation, defined for all times;\n(ii) if f0 has finite entropy, then the entropy of the solution remains uniformly bounded\nand the solution satisfies\n\u2200 t > 0, \u2200 v \u2208 RN ,\n\n\u2212\n\n|v|2\n\ne 2\u03b8(t)\n.\nf (t, v) \u2265 \u03c1(t)\n(2\u03c0\u03b8(t))N/2\n\nThe constants \u03c1(t), \u03b8(t) > 0 are explicit and depend on the mass, energy and\nentropy of f0 ; they are uniform for t \u2192 +\u221e but not necessarily for t \u2192 0.\nRemark: Let us sketch briefly how it is possible to relax the assumption of the boundedness of the entropy of the initial datum in point (ii) in the case \u03b3 > 0 in dimension 3.\nIndeed Mischler and Wennberg [28, Lemma 2.1] proved in this case that\ng = Q+ (Q+ (f, f ), f )\nis uniformly integrable, with constants depending on the L12 norm of f . The bound on\nthe entropy is only used in the obtaining of the upheaval point in Lemma 2.3, whose\nproof requires the uniform integrability of the function. But in the initialization step of\n\n\f32\n\nCL\u00c9MENT MOUHOT\n\nProposition 3.2, it is possible, up some tricky computations, to obtain by iterating twice\nmore the Duhamel representation\nh \u0002\ni\n\u0003\n\u2200 v \u2208 RN , |v| \u2264 R0 , f (t, x+vt, v) \u2265 CT,R0 ,B Q+ Q+ g0R0 (x, *), g0R0 (x, *) , g0R0 (x, *) (v)\n\nwhere g0 = Q+ (Q+ (f0 , f0 ), f0 ). As g0 is uniformly integrable (with explicit bounds) by\nthe result of Mischler and Wennberg above, one can apply Lemma 2.3 to\nh \u0002\ni\n\u0003\nQ+ Q+ g0R0 (x, *), g0R0 (x, *) , g0R0 (x, *) (v)\n\nto get the upheaval point and the rest of the proof is unchanged.\n\nProof of Theorem 5.1. Let us prove (i): In the case \u03a6 satisfies assumption (1.2) with \u03b3 > 0,\nthe existence and uniqueness in L12 (for solutions with non-increasing energy) are proved\nin [28]. In the case \u03b3 = 0 or \u03a6 satisfies assumption (1.3) with \u03b3 \u2208 (\u2212N, 0), existence and\nuniqueness in L12 can be deduced from Arkeryd [3]: in this case the collision operator is a\nbounded bilinear operator in L1 , which implies the uniqueness, and the global existence\nis proved by the monotonicity argument from [3]. For (ii): In all these cases the mass and\nenergy are conserved. By the H theorem, if the entropy of the initial datum is bounded,\nthen it remains bounded uniformly for all times. Thus the solution satisfies (1.6) and one\ncan apply Theorem 1.1 and concludes the proof.\n\u0003\nNow we give a theorem for non-cutoff mollified hard potentials collision kernels, using a\nrecent result of Desvillettes and Wennberg [13]. Here S(RN\nv ) denotes the Schwartz space\nof the functions with all derivatives bounded and decreasing faster at infinity than any\ninverse of polynomial.\nTheorem 5.2. Let B = \u03a6 b be a collision kernel satisfying assumptions (1.1), with \u03a6\nsatisfying assumption (1.3) with \u03b3 > 0 and C \u221e , and b satisfying (1.4) with \u03bd \u2208 (0, 2). Let\nf0 be a nonnegative initial condition on RN\nv with finite mass, energy and entropy. Then\n(i) there exists a solution f to the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation with\nconstant mass and energy and uniformly bounded entropy, defined for all times\nand belonging to L\u221e ([t0 , +\u221e), S(RN\nv )) for any t0 > 0;\n(ii) this solution satisfies\n\u2200 t > 0, \u2200 v \u2208 RN ,\n\nf (t, v) \u2265 C1 (t) e\u2212C2 (t) |v|\n\nK\n\nfor any exponent K such that\nK>2\n\n\u0010\nlog 2 +\n\n2\u03bd\n2\u2212\u03bd\n\nlog 2\n\n\u0011\n\n.\n\nThe constants C1 (t), C2 (t) > 0 are explicit and depend on the mass, energy, entropy of f0 and K; they are uniform for t \u2192 +\u221e but not necessarily for t \u2192 0.\n\n\fQUANTITATIVE LOWER BOUNDS FOR THE FULL BOLTZMANN EQUATION\n\n33\n\nProof of Theorem 5.2. First let us prove (i): Our assumptions on B imply the assumptions [13, Assumption 2] on the collision kernel B, namely B = \u03a6 b with \u03a6 a smooth and\nstrictly positive function such that \u03a6(z) \u223c|z|\u2192+\u221e |z|\u03b3 with \u03b3 \u2208 (0, 1], and b such that\nb(cos \u03b8) \u223c\u03b8\u21920 cst \u03b8 \u2212(N \u22121)\u2212\u03bd with \u03bd > 0. Concerning the initial datum our assumptions\nare exactly those of [13, Assumption 1]. So we can apply [13, Theorem 1] to prove the\nexistence of a solution, lying in L\u221e ([t0 , +\u221e), S(RN\nv )) for any t0 > 0. For (ii): The explicit\n\u221e\nN\nbound L ([t0 , +\u221e), S(Rv )) for any t0 > 0 immediately implies the uniform bounds (1.6)\nand (1.8). Thus one can apply Theorem 1.2 to obtain the lower bound for t \u2265 t0 + \u03c4 . As\nt0 and \u03c4 are arbitrarily small this concludes the proof.\n\u0003\nFor spatially inhomogeneous solutions we can apply our results to the solutions near\nthe equilibrium in a torus constructed by Ukai (see [33, 34] and [8, Section 7.6]) for hard\nspheres and Guo [21] for soft potentials. For the sake of clarity, we do not explicit in full\ndetails the functional settings in which these solutions are constructed and refer to the\nabove-mentioned references for more precise definitions.\nTheorem 5.3. Let B = \u03a6 b be a collision kernel satisfying assumptions (1.1), with\na- \u03a6 satisfying assumption (1.2) with \u03b3 = 1 and b = 1 (solutions of Ukai) or\nb- \u03a6 satisfying assumption (1.2) with \u03b3 < 0 and b satisfying (1.4) with \u03bd < 0 (solutions of Guo).\nLet f0 = M + M 1/2 h0 (M is the global Maxwellian equilibrium) be a nonnegative initial\nN\ncondition on TN\nx \u00d7 Rv such that\nX\nkh0 k2H s,q :=\nkh0 hviq k2L2 (TN \u00d7RN ) \u2264 \u01eb0\n|i|+|j|\u2264s\n\nwith s, q, \u01eb0 > 0. Then\n(i) for any s\u2032 , q \u2032 > 0, if s, q are large enough and \u01eb0 is small enough, there exists a\n\u2032 \u2032\nunique solution f to the full Boltzmann equation in H s ,q , defined for all times,\n\u2032\n\u2032\nwith uniform bound in H s ,q depending on \u01eb0 ;\n(ii) this solution satisfies\n\u2200 t > 0, \u2200 x \u2208 TN , \u2200 v \u2208 RN ,\n\n\u2212\n\n|v|2\n\ne 2\u03b8(t)\n.\nf (t, x, v) \u2265 \u03c1(t)\n(2\u03c0\u03b8(t))N/2\n\nThe constants \u03c1(t), \u03b8(t) > 0 depend on \u01eb0 ; they are uniform for t \u2192 +\u221e but not\nnecessarily for t \u2192 0.\nRemarks: 1. Most probably the solutions of Ukai could extend to any cutoff hard\npotentials, even if they were constructed for hard spheres. Anyhow the method of Guo\nwould probably recover the result for any cutoff hard potentials as well.\n2. The proof of Ukai uses the spectral gap of the linearized collision operator for hard\nspheres, which was known to exist since Grad [20]. This spectral gap was obtained by\nnon-constructive method (essentially the Weyl's Theorem about compact perturbation of\n\n\f34\n\nCL\u00c9MENT MOUHOT\n\nthe essential spectrum). However explicit estimates on this spectral gap were recently\nobtained in [5], which is a step forward into a constructive theory. Nevertheless at now\nthe proofs of Ukai (and Guo for soft potentials) still do not provide constructive bounds.\n3. One can apply the result of convergence to equilibrium of Desvillettes and Villani [12]\nto the solutions of Theorem 5.3, which do satisfy every assumption of [12, Theorem 2].\nThus they converges almost exponentially to equilibrium, i.e\nkft \u2212 M kL1x,v \u2264 C\u03b1 t\u22121/\u03b1\nwhere \u03b1 can be taken as big as wanted when s and q are large enough, and the constant\nC\u03b1 is explicit according to the uniform regularity bounds on f and the constants in the\nlower bound. For the solutions of Ukai in the hard spheres case, this result is weaker than\nthe exponential convergence to equilibrium already proved by Ukai, but the convergence\nto equilibrium was unknown for the solutions of Guo in the case of soft potentials.\n4. Let us explain how to skip the \"upheaval step\" of the proof for solutions near the\nequilibrium. Indeed in the case of perturbative solutions, which are L\u221e close to a global\nMaxwellian distribution, Lemma 2.3 can be bypassed by a more direct argument: up to\nreduce the neightborhood of the Maxwellian distribution for the existence theory (i.e.\nreducing \u01eb0 ), the uniform L\u221e control of smallness on h yields\n\u2200 t \u2208 R+ , \u2200 x \u2208 TN , \u2200 v \u2208 RN ,\n\nf (t, x, v) \u2265 \u03b70 1B(0,\u03b40 )\n\nfor some \u03b70 > 0 and \u03b40 > 0.\nProof of Theorem 5.3. One can check easily that for s and q large enough and \u01eb0 small\nenough in the assumptions on the initial data, f0 satisfies the assumptions of [8, Theorem 7.6.2] in the case of Ukai's solutions, and the assumptions of [21, Theorem 1] for Guo's\nsolutions. Then for s large enough, the uniform smoothness estimates on the solution im, uniform for all times, and going to 0 as \u01eb0 \u2192 0.\nply in both cases a bound on kht kL\u221e\nx,v\nThus if one take \u01eb0 small enough such that\n\u0012\n\u0013Z\nZ\np\n1\nM (v) dv\nM (v) dv \u2264\nsup kht kL\u221e\nx,v\n2 RN\nt\u22650\nRN\nv\nv\none immediately get\n\n\u033af \u2265\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\nM (v) dv > 0\nRN\nv\n\nfor all times. The uniform upper bounds on the local energy and local entropy (and local\nLp bound) follow from the uniform regularity bounds on the solution. Thus the solution\nsatisfies (1.6) and (1.7) and one can apply Theorem 1.1 and conclude the proof.\n\u0003\nFinally, let us say a few words about other Cauchy theories.\nIn the spatially inhomogeneous setting, one could apply Theorem 1.1 to solutions for\nsmall time constructed in [23] (in the cutoff case). We did not detail this application since\nwe were more interested with global solutions.\n\n\fQUANTITATIVE LOWER BOUNDS FOR THE FULL BOLTZMANN EQUATION\n\n35\n\nOne could also apply Theorem 1.1 to the global weakly inhomogeneous solutions (for\ncutoff hard potentials) constructed by Arkeryd, Esposito and Pulvirenti in [4], which\nwould give a Maxwellian lower bound on these solutions (uniform as t \u2192 +\u221e). Note\nthat the uniform bounds on the solution obtained in [4] do not seem to be constructive.\nAs a consequence the Maxwellian lower bound given by Theorem 1.1 would not have\nconstructive constants.\nConcerning the global solutions in the whole space RN near the vacuum constructed\nby Kaniel, Illner and Shinbrot (cf. [22, 27, 19] or [8, Section 5.2]), a lower bound on the\nN\nsolution f (t, x, v) cannot be uniform in space since f (t, *, *) is integrable on RN\nx \u00d7 Rv , and\nit cannot be uniform as t goes to infinity since the solution goes to 0 as t goes to infinity\nfor every (x, v) such that v 6= 0 (see [8, Theorem 5.2.2]). Our method could not apply,\nand is more adapted to evolution problems in bounded domains. We note that for these\nsolutions in the whole space, in some cases a bound from below on the solutions by a\n\"travelling Maxwellian\"\n\u2200 t \u2265 0, \u2200 x \u2208 RN , \u2200 v \u2208 RN ,\n\n2\n\nf (t, x, v) \u2265 C(t) e\u2212\u03b2 |x\u2212tv| e\u2212\u03b1 |v|\n\n2\n\n(where \u03b1 > 0 and \u03b2 > 0 are absolute constants, and C(t) > 0 is a constant depending on\ntime) can replace our method to provide a lower bound (see for instance [19], and also, in\nthe same spirit [26]).\nAcknowledgment: Support by the European network HYKE, funded by the EC as\ncontract HPRN-CT-2002-00282, is acknowledged.\nReferences\n[1] Alexandre, R. and Desvillettes, L. and Villani, C. and Wennberg, B., On the rate of entropy\nproduction for the Boltzmann equation.
