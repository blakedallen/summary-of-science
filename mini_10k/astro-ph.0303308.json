We present an analysis of available HST STIS\nechelle and FUSE UV spectroscopy of RX J1230.8+0115, in which we detect five Ly-\u03b1 absorbers at Virgo\ndistances. One of these absorbers is a blend of two strong metal line absorbers at a recession velocity\ncoincident with the highest neutral hydrogen column density absorber in the 3C 273 sight line, \u223c 350\nh\u22121\n70 kpc away. The consistency of the metal line column density ratios in the RX J1230.8+0115 sight\nline allows us to determine the ionization mechanism (photoionization) for these absorbers. While the\nlow signal-to-noise ratio of the FUSE spectrum limits our ability to model the neutral hydrogen column\ndensity of these absorbers precisely, we are able to constrain them to be in the range 1016\u221217 cm\u22122 .\nThe properties of these absorbers are similar to those obtained for the nearby 3C 273 absorber studied\nby Tripp and collaborators. However, the inferred line-of-sight size for the 3C 273 absorber is only 70\npc, much smaller than those inferred in RX J1230.8+0115, which are 10 \u2013 30 h\u22121\n70 of kpc. The small\n> 350 h\u22121 kpc minimum transverse size implied by an\nsizes of all three absorbers are at odds with the \u223c\n70\napplication of the standard QSO line pairs analysis. On the basis of absorber associations between these\ntwo sight lines we conclude that a large-scale structure filament produces a correlated, not contiguous,\ngaseous structure in this region of the Virgo Supercluster. These data may indicate that we are detecting\noverdensities in the large scale structure filaments in this region. Alternatively, the presence of a galaxy\n71h\u22121\n70 kpc from a 3C 273 absorber may indicate that we have probed outflowing, starburst driven shells\nof gas associated with nearby galaxies.\nThe correlation between absorbers in quasar pairs is often used to determine statistically the sizes of absorbers,\nparticularly at high redshift (e.g., Foltz et al. 1984; Bechtold et al. 1994; Crotts et al. 1994; Dinshaw et al.\n1997, 1998). These QSO sight line pair experiments yield\ncharacteristic radii for higher column density (log NHI \u2265\n14.5 cm\u22122 ) absorbers of 300 \u2013 700h\u22121\n70 kpc, with some\nevidence for increasing sizes at lower redshifts (Dinshaw\net al. 1998). These very large size measurements are\nconsistent with the expectations of cosmological N-body\nsimulations (Dav\u00e9 et al. 1999) as well as the expectations\nfrom an analytical Jeans' mass theory of gravitationallybound, photoionized clouds (Schaye 2001). From a census\nof Ly-\u03b1 forest absorbers using HST/GHRS and STIS observations, Penton et al. (2000b, 2003) find that \u223c40% of\nall local baryons reside in the forest. This estimate, however, assumes a characteristic radii for spherical absorbing\nstructures of 100h\u22121\n70 kpc. It is uncertain whether this size,\nderived from high redshift absorber pairs, is an appropriate\nmeasurement of the absorber's contiguous size or merely\nthe length scale over which the absorbers are associated\nwith the same large scale structure (Dinshaw et al. 1998).\nAlternatively, the physical line-of-sight dimension of ab-\n\n1. introduction\n\nThe structure and origin of Ly-\u03b1 \"forest\" absorbers remains uncertain despite decades of study with groundbased telescopes and more recently with the Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST). It has been argued that Ly-\u03b1 forest absorbers are related to the extended halos of bright galaxies\n(e.g., Lin et al. 2000; Lanzetta et al. 1995), that they are\nassociated with dwarf or low surface brightness galaxies\n(e.g., Impey & Bothun 1997), or that they are one phase\nof the gaseous medium in spiral-rich galaxy groups (Morris & van den Berg 1994; Shull et al. 1998; Tripp et al.\n2001; Bowen et al. 2002). Alternatively, it has been\nproposed that they are \"primordial\" overdensities associated with large scale structure, but not with any galaxy in\nparticular (Dav\u00e9 et al. 1999; Stocke et al. 2001; Penton\net al. 2002). It is possible that all of these scenarios are\nrepresented. Therefore, knowing the fraction of the Ly-\u03b1\nforest associated with a given scenario, as a function of\ncolumn density and redshift, is essential if we are going\nto use studies of the Ly-\u03b1 forest to understand the formation and early evolution of galaxies. The size and shape of\nthese absorbing structures bears directly on the fraction\nof absorbers associated with a specific environment.\n1\n\n\f2\nsorbers can be derived by assuming photoionization equilibrium, from measurements of H I column density, metal\nline strengths and the ratio of line strengths for different\nionization states of the same species. The line strengths\nand ratios can be used to constrain metallicities and physical densities in these structures assuming photoionization\nequilibrium with the extragalactic ionizing flux (Bechtold\n1994; Shull et al. 1999; Weymann et al. 2001; Donahue,\nAldering & Stocke 1995). The calculation of hydrogen\ndensities from the photoionization models can then be used\nto infer physical sizes along the line-of-sight. The sizes determined for absorbers with strong, low ionization metal\nlines like C II, Si II, Mg II and Fe II (Steidel 1995; Rigby,\nCharlton, & Churchill 2002; Tripp et al. 2002), are much\nsmaller than the characteristic sizes in the plane of the sky\nobtained from the QSO pairs experiments. For example,\nthe low ionization absorbers with relatively weak Mg II\nabsorption (<0.3\u00c5) have sizes derived from a photoionization equilibrium calculation which are < 1 kpc (Rigby,\nCharlton, & Churchill 2002).\nIn this paper we present the case of a pair of QSOs,\n3C 273 and RX J1230.8+0115, which probe the outskirts\nof the Virgo Cluster at physical separations between the\nsight lines of 200 \u2013 500h\u22121\n70 kpc. Both sight lines contain strong (log NHI \u223c 16 cm\u22122 ) Ly-\u03b1 absorption systems\nwhich have relatively low ionization absorption line spectra. This low redshift pair provides us the opportunity to\nuse both of the aforementioned size determination methods at redshifts where we can obtain a deep galaxy census.\nTripp et al. (2002; T2002 hereafter) presented an analysis of the absorption along the line-of-sight to 3C 273,\n0.9\u25e6 away from RX J1230.8+0115 on the sky. T2002 studied the two strong absorbers at Virgo distances (cz=1011\nand 1586 km s\u22121 ) in a STIS echelle (7 km s\u22121 resolution)\nspectrum of 3C 273 obtained by Heap et al. (2002). These\ntwo absorbers had been detected and studied using the\nFaint Object Spectrograph (Bahcall et al. 1991) and the\nGHRS (Morris et al. 1991; Weymann et al. 1995). More recently 3C 273 was observed with the Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE; Sembach et al. 2001) allowing\ndetections of the higher Lyman lines in both of these Virgo\nabsorbers and O VI absorption in the 1011 km s\u22121 absorber. The 1586 km s\u22121 absorber contains only low ionization absorption lines of C II, Si II and Si III. Using a\ncurve-of-growth analysis and a standard photoionization\nmodel T2002 constrained the column density (log NHI =\n15.85 cm\u22122 ), b-value = 16.1 km s\u22121 , metallicity ([C/H]=1.2 and [Si/C]=+0.2 in solar units) and the density (log\nnH = -2.8 cm\u22123 ); these values determine the line-of-sight\nsize of this absorber to be 70 pc.\nWe discuss the hydrogen and metal absorption lines at\nVirgo distances (cz=800-2400 km s\u22121 ) that we have identified in the available STIS echelle and FUSE spectra of RX\nJ1230.8+0115 (\u00a72). In \u00a73 we discuss in detail our inferences concerning the NHI , metallicity and ionization parameter for the cz=1699 km s\u22121 absorption complex based\nupon the HST and FUSE data, and the assumption of\nphotoionization equilibrium. In \u00a74 we discuss the galaxy\ndistribution around these absorbers; in \u00a75 we discuss the\ninferences based upon the coincident absorption line pairs\nin these two spectra. \u00a76 contains both a summary of our\nobservational results and a discussion of the model that\n\nbest fits all of the information currently available on the\nlow ionization, coincident velocity absorbers in these two\nsight lines. Throughout this paper we use H0 =70 km s\u22121\nMpc\u22121 and determine distances assuming a pure Hubble\nflow; the use of the Tonry et al. (2000) Virgocentric infall model reduces distances in this vicinity by \u223c10% for\ngalaxies with cz = 1500 \u2212 1800 km s\u22121 . We cannot rule\nout that redshifts yield a double-valued distance solution\nat this local Supercluster location (Tonry et al. 2000).\n2. uv spectroscopy of rx j1230.8+0115\n\nWe describe the HST and FUSE spectroscopy of RX\nJ1230.8+0115 at recession velocities which correspond to\nVirgo Cluster distances, with primary emphasis on a very\nstrong, two-component absorber at \u223c1700 km s\u22121 . While\nthe emission line redshift of this AGN (z=0.117) allows\ndetection of absorbers at higher redshifts than Virgo, they\nwill not be discussed here. First we describe the Ly-\u03b1 and\nmetal-line absorptions seen in an echelle mode spectrum\nobtained with STIS, then show the higher-order Lyman series lines for the strongest two absorbers at Virgo distances\nobtained with FUSE. An analysis of a GHRS first order\ngrating spectrum of RX J1230.8+0115 was presented by\nPenton, Stocke & Shull (2000a), in which 5 of the 6 absorbers tabulated here were detected.\n2.1. Ly-\u03b1 Absorbers\nObservations of RX J1230.8+0115 were obtained with\nthe E140M echelle mode of STIS using the 0.2\u2032\u2032 \u00d70.06\u2032\u2032\naperture on January 1 and January 13, 1999 (M. Rauch,\nPI). The resolution of the spectrum is 7 km s\u22121 over the\nspectral range of 1150 to 1710 \u00c5. The data reduction of\nthe spectrum was done using the standard STIS extraction procedures. This reduction package returns heliocentric velocities which are estimated to be accurate to \u00b1 4\nkm s\u22121 (STIS data handbook). The RX J1230.8+0115\nspectrum has considerably lower signal-to-noise (SNR)\nthan the 3C 273 spectrum of Heap et al. (2002) because it\nis \u223c 10 times fainter. Nevertheless, the Virgo distance Ly\u03b1 absorbers are strong enough to be easily detected (see\nalso Penton, Stocke, & Shull 2000a).\nFigure 1 shows the region of Ly-\u03b1 absorption for Virgo\nvelocities (cz < 2500 km s\u22121 ) in the RX J1230.8+0115\nsight line. We have binned these data by 3 pixels, giving a pixel width of 9.7 km s\u22121 and removed a continuum\nthat is the best by-eye fit to the damped Ly-\u03b1 profile. We\nget a best-fit value for Galactic NH = 1.6 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122\nscaled to a continuum. This fit is shown in Figure 1 (solid\nline). We also show a spline fit (dashed line) that was\nused to estimate line significance between 1218 and 1221\n\u00c5 because the Galactic damped Ly-\u03b1 fit appears to underestimate the true continuum in this region indicating that\nthe AGN continuum must be rising blueward of 1221 \u00c5.\nAlso shown are the errors in the flux measurements. The\nabsorption lines were fit with Voigt profiles using VPFIT\n(Carswell et al. 2002). We identify 5 lines (one of which\nhas 2 components) at 4-\u03c3 or greater significance, and one\nline at greater than 3.5-\u03c3 significance. Because there are\nno Galactic metal lines and no metal lines related to the\nassociated absorbers, we identify all of the absorptions as\nintergalactic Ly-\u03b1. Table 1 contains the following information about these absorbers: (1) central wavelength of\n\n\f3\nthe Voigt profile fit in \u00c5, (2) central velocity of the fit\n(heliocentric, non-relativistic, in km s\u22121 ) (3) the redshift\nand (4) its associated error, (5) the b-value and (6) its associated error in km s\u22121 , (7) the log of the H I column\ndensity and (8) its associated error in cm\u22122 \u2013 these errors\ninclude a continuum placement error derived by adding\nand subtracting one-third of the rms from the continuum,\n(9) the rest frame equivalent width (EW) of the data (not\nof the Voigt profile fit) measured in m\u00c5, (10) the 4-\u03c3 EW\nlimit integrated over the same velocity width for which\nthe EW in column 9 was calculated (typically 3 \u2013 4 times\nthe b-value in column 5). All of these values, except for\nthe lines at 1685 and 1721 km s\u22121 , are single component\nfits determined from the Ly-\u03b1 absorptions alone. For these\ntwo components (1685 and 1721 km s\u22121 ) we have fixed the\nredshifts (based upon the observed metal line redshifts discussed in the next section) and the column densities (at\nlog NHI = 16.2 and 16.6 cm\u22122 as discussed in \u00a72.4), which\nis why there are no quoted errors.\n\n2.2. Metal Lines Associated with the RX J1230.8+0115\nAbsorbers\nWe have examined the RX J1230.8+0115 STIS echelle\nspectrum for metal lines associated with the H I absorptions discussed above and detect metal-line absorption in\nonly the z = 0.005668 complex. Two component metal\nlines of C II, C IV, Si II, Si III, and Si IV are found associated with this complex. We used the FUSE data (see\n\u00a72.3) to search the region of C III absorption at this redshift, but we do not fit the C III absorption because the\nspectrum is noisy and the potential C III absorptions are\nblended with Galactic H2 . We also do not fit the Si III\nabsorptions in the STIS echelle data because they are far\ndown on the damping-wing of Galactic Ly-\u03b1 and, therefore\nin a region of very low S/N. The local continuum around\nthe metal lines was determined with a linear least squares\nfit, as the regions were determined to be flat. The metal\nlines were then fit using VPFIT as for the Ly-\u03b1 lines. Figure 2 shows these metal lines and the VPFIT results are\nsummarized in Table 2. Except for column (1), which lists\nthe identified ion, the columns have the same descriptors\nas Table 1. The final column gives 4-\u03c3 limits which are\nalso appropriate for metal line non-detections in the other\nLy-\u03b1 absorbers listed in Table 1. The statistical errors on\nthe b-values listed in column (6) are errors returned on the\nspecific line profile fits in Figure 2.\n\nFig. 1.- The region of Ly-\u03b1 absorption for Virgo velocities in\nthe RX J1230.8+0115 sight line. The data have been binned by\nthree pixels and the continuum has been fitted with a damped\nLy-\u03b1 profile (solid line; see text) and a spline fit (dashed line). The\nspline fit is used to fit the region between 1218 and 1221 \u00c5 since\nGalactic damped Ly-\u03b1 fit appears to underestimate the continuum\nslightly in this region, indicating that the AGN continuum is\nrising blueward of 1221\u00c5. The vertical marks above the spectrum\nindicate the \u22654\u03c3 absorption lines detected (see Table 1). The\ndotted vertical mark indicates the \u22653\u03c3 absorption line that has\nbeen detected in this region. The two smaller ticks represent the\npositions of the metal line components in the strong absorber\nblend. The lower curve shows the errors in the flux as a function of\nwavelength.\n\nThe 4-\u03c3 EW limits given in Table 1 indicate that all of\nthese absorption-line detections are stronger than 4-\u03c3 except for the line at 1219.27 \u00c5 which is 3.5-\u03c3. Our strongest\nabsorbers, the z = 0.005668 (1699 km s\u22121 ) blend and the\nz = 0.007680 (2302 km s\u22121 ) absorption, are both highly\nsaturated, which makes it much more difficult to obtain\naccurate measurements of column densities and b-values.\nIn fact, for the 1699 km s\u22121 blend, we have run an entire\ngrid of H I column density models and found little discrimination based upon the Ly-\u03b1 fits alone over the range\n1015.0\u221217.6 cm\u22122 (reduced \u03c72 values of 1.1-2.1 over this\nrange). Because the Ly-\u03b1 data are insufficient for this\ntask, we discuss further constraints on the H I column\ndensity in the z = 0.005668 complex in \u00a72.4.\n\nFig. 2.- The metal lines associated with the z = 0.005668\nabsorber. We see two component lines corresponding to C II, C IV,\nSi II, Si III, Si IV. The region of C III in the FUSE data has been\nshown, but it has not been fit because it is blended with Galactic\nH2 . The two histograms in the C III plot show the SIC1B and\nSIC2A data separately. There is no fit to the Si III data because\nSi III is in a very low S/N region on the damping wing of Galactic\nLy-\u03b1 making a fit to this line highly unreliable. However, we see\nthe same two-component absorption in the Si III and possibly\nC III as in the other ions. The STIS data have been displayed\nwith no binning to show the full resolution noise level of the spectra.\n\nIn all cases where metal lines are detected, two components are detected well within the broad, saturated, Ly-\u03b1\nprofile shown at the top of Figure 2. Because the velocities\nof the two components are consistent between species and\nionization states, we have used the velocity of the strong\n\n\f4\nC II components to constrain the velocities of the 1685\nand 1721 km s\u22121 components in the Lyman line analysis.\nThe consistency of the column density ratios and the line\nprofile shapes provides an excellent indication that the gas\nis photoionized and has a simple kinematic structure. A\nsubstantial contribution from collisionally-ionized gas is\nunlikely.\nThe metal lines all have resolved line profiles that provide a measurement of the total b-value. These line widths\nare inconsistent with being due to pure thermal broadening since photoionization models predict temperatures\nbelow 20,000 \u25e6 K while a thermal broadening interpretation of the line widths implies temperatures of \u223c90,000\n\u25e6\nK. However, the line widths of the 1720 km s\u22121 line (the\nsignal-to-noise of the 1685 km s\u22121 line is too low to provide reliable b-value constraints) are consistent within 2-\u03c3\nwith the same amount of bulk or turbulent motion for all\nof the ionization states.\n\nby acceptable fits to the Ly-\u03b1 line which range from log\nNHI = 15 \u2013 17.6 cm\u22122 for the lower column density component. For all of these fits we have assumed that the\ntwo components, fixed at the metal line velocities, have\ncomparable metallicities and, therefore, roughly consistent\nrelative H I column densities. The Lyman-limit does not\nplace a significant constraint on the column density due to\nconfusion with a plethora of Galactic lines in the 915-920\u00c5\nrange. Figure 3 shows that even with the FUSE data, it is\nvery difficult to distinguish between these column densities. It does appear that the column density is larger than\nlog NHI = 15.2 and 15.0 cm\u22122 for the two components,\nand probably larger than 1016 cm\u22122 in both components.\nAn assumption that the metallicity is \u223c 6% solar as in\nthe T2002 absorber, implies log NHI = 16.2, 16.6 cm\u22122\n(see \u00a73) is not a bad one. However, the FUSE spectrum is\ninadequate to constrain the column densities at the high\nend.\n\n2.3. FUSE Observations of Higher-Order Lyman Lines\n\n2.4. Observational Constraints on the Column Densities\nof the H I Absorptions at z = 0.005668\n\nRX J1230.8+0115 was only observed in three brief\n\"snapshots\" totaling 4031 seconds with FUSE. Nevertheless, we examined the co-added snapshots to better constrain the H I column density of the z = 0.005668 complex.\nThe spectrum has a SNR of 1.1 for the SIC1B channel and\n1.5 for the SIC2A channel. We have binned the data by\n8 pixels for a resolution of 16 km s\u22121 per pixel. The data\nwere processed using CALFUSE version 2.1.6.\n\nThe saturation of the z = 0.005668 complex and the\npoor quality of the FUSE spectrum make it difficult to determine accurate column densities, so we list our best-fits\nand constraints for these values, in order of most to least\nsecure.\n\u2022 We place a firm lower limit on the H I column density in this line-of-sight by integrating the optical\ndepth pixel by pixel within the line (Savage & Sembach 1991) using the equation:\nN\u03c4v\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\nn\n3.767 \u00d7 1014 X\nIc (vi )\n=\nln\ndvi ,\nf \u03bb0\nI(vi )\ni=1\n\n(1)\n\nwhere I(vi ) is the observed flux and Ic (vi ) is the estimated continuum. If the observed flux is less than\nthe rms in the flux, we assign the flux to be equal\nto the rms for that pixel. \u03bb0 = 1215.67\u00c5, the rest\nwavelength for the Ly-\u03b1 transition, and f = 0.416\nis the oscillator strength. The lower limit to the\ncolumn density from this method is 3\u00d71014 cm\u22122 .\n\u2022 The consistency of the metal line column density\nratios argues for a photoionization model while the\nlack of variation in the line profiles for different ions\nand species argues for a single phase for the gas.\n\nFig. 3.- Fits to the FUSE data on the Lyman series lines\nassociated with the z = 0.005668 absorber, spanning a plausible\nrange of column densities based on fits to the Ly-\u03b1 line. The\ncentral fit is for a metallicity of 0.06 Z\u2299 for each component. These\ndata indicate that fits as low as log NHI = 15 cm\u22122 are excluded\nand that fits with log NHI \u2265 16 cm\u22122 are probable.\n\nFigure 3 shows the portion of the Lyman series detected\nfor this absorption complex. Lyman-\u03b2 has not been included because it is severely blended with a Galactic O VI\nline and Lyman-\u03b7 has also been omitted because it is\nblended with Galactic Lyman-\u01eb. Various fits are shown\nspanning a plausible range in H I column density bounded\n\n\u2022 While it is difficult to use the FUSE data to place\naccurate constraints on these two absorbers, it\nseems probable that the Ly-\u01eb, Ly-\u03b6, and Ly-\u03b8 absorptions requires log NHI > 16.0 cm\u22122 .\n\u2022 We have used the redshifts of the C II absorption lines in this complex to fix the positions of\nthe H I components. For the Ly-\u03b1 saturated absorption complex, the best-fit (\u03c72\u03bd = 1.1) from VPFIT is found when log NHI = 15.0 cm\u22122 for the\nz = 0.00562 component and log NHI = 15.2 cm\u22122\nfor the z = 0.00574 component. But these column densities are not consistent with the strong,\nalbeit noisy, higher Lyman series absorption seen\nwith FUSE. Further, as we discuss in \u00a73, if the\n\n\f5\ngas is photoionized such low values of NHI imply\nmetallicities of order solar to account for the C II\nand C IV column densities. Metallicities greater\nthan 0.3 solar are unlikely, as this corresponds to\nthe metallicity of the intracluster medium at the\ncenter of the Virgo Cluster as derived from the Xray observations (Hwang et al. 1997). By comparison, the metallicity found in the 3C 273 strong absorber at this velocity is 6% solar (T2002). While\nwe can derive acceptable Ly-\u03b1 line fits for all column densities tried up to log NHI = 17.8 cm\u22122 for\nthe z = 0.00562 component and log NHI = 18.0\ncm\u22122 for the z = 0.00574 component, for column\ndensities exceeding 1017 cm\u22122 the b-values derived\nto fit the Ly-\u03b1 equivalent widths are unrealistically\nlow (8-14 km s\u22121 ) for these absorbers. While such\nlow measured values are possible if these absorbers\nhave no turbulent motion (Dav\u00e9 & Tripp 2001), the\npresence of C IV and Si IV at comparable strength\nto C II and Si II make such low values very unlikely;\ne.g., the 3C 273 absorber studied by T2002 has no\nC IV and b= 16.1 km s\u22121 . We conclude that the\nmost likely column density range that fits all the\ndata is NHI =1016\u221217 cm\u22122 .\n\u2022 If we assume that the metallicities of the components are the same as for the T2002 absorber in the\n3C 273 sight line, we derive column densities of 1.6\n\u00d71016 cm\u22122 and 4.0 \u00d71016 cm\u22122 . The Ly-\u03b1 fit has\na \u03c72\u03bd = 2.04 (probability = 0.005), insignificantly\ndifferent from the nominal best fits discussed above.\nThese are the values shown in the middle panel of\nFigure 3 and are clearly consistent with the FUSE\ndata. These values also have reasonable, although\nsomewhat low, b-values for low-z Ly-\u03b1 absorbers of\n17 and 16 km s\u22121 respectively.\nIn conclusion, while we cannot prove based upon the\ndata alone that the column density of these two absorbers\nis log NHI = 16.2 and 16.6 cm\u22122 and that the metallicities are a few percent of solar, these values are the most\nprobable for this absorption complex. Our \"best guess\"\nmodel has log NHI = 16.2, 16.6 cm\u22122 derived from the\nassumption that Z=0.06 Z\u2299 , as in the T2002 absorber,\nfor the two components.\n3. a photoionization model of the z = 0.005668\n\nabsorber complex\nBecause the highly saturated Ly-\u03b1 absorption profile\nand the poor quality of the FUSE spectrum make it difficult to constrain the H I column density precisely, we use\nthe metal line ratios to determine the properties of the gas\nbefore returning to analyze the H I absorption informed by\nthe metal-line data. As summarized in Table 2, the metal\nlines are associated with two velocity components, one at\nv \u223c 1685 km s\u22121 , and one at v \u223c 1721 km s\u22121 . These\nvelocity components show no differences in structure as a\nfunction of species or ionization state suggesting that the\ngas is in a single phase. Several lines of argument favor a\nphotoionization model for the gas: (1) for the v \u223c 1721\nkms\u22121 component, limits on the line width constrain the\ntemperature of the gas to be less than 105,000 \u25e6 K; (2) the\n\nrelative Si II and C II column densities of both components are compatible with equal ionization fractions (after\naccounting for the relative abundances of Si and C); (3)\nPurely collisional ionization is inconsistent with the Si II/C\nII ratio for temperatures above 20,000 \u25e6 K (Sutherland &\nDopita 1993). However, at temperatures below 20,000 \u25e6 K\nextremely little C IV or Si IV would be observed.\nThus, we consider the properties of the gas at each velocity in turn assuming: (1) all observed ionization stages\nof carbon and silicon are associated with the same gas,\nwhich is compatible with the ratio of column densities, as\nwe will show; (2) the gas is primarily photoionized, which\nis consistent with the predominance of lower ionization\nstages for carbon and silicon and with the consistency of\nthe column density ratios; (3) the gas is approximated as\na plane parallel slab illuminated by a quasar-dominated\nspectrum (Shull et al. 1999; Haardt & Madau 1996) with\nan intrinsic power law spectrum of spectral energy index\n\u03b1 = 1.8.\nTo model the physical properties of the gas we have constructed a large grid of photoionization models using the\nphotoionization code Cloudy (Ferland 1996). The calculated column densities of C II, C IV, Si II, Si III, and Si IV\ndepend primarily on the metallicity, H I column density,\nand ionization parameter U = n\u03b3 /nH . Relative to these\nparameters, the uncertainty in the spectral shape of the\nextragalactic background radiation contributes a negligible difference to the models.\nAt this point, we examine the dependence of the\nN(C II)/N(C IV), and N(Si II)/N(Si IV) column density\nratios on the ionization parameter. For a given metallicity and H I column density, we can plot these ion ratios\nversus U, as shown in Figure 4. In this figure we assume\nthe metallicity to be (C/H) = 0.06 solar (corresponding to\nlog NHI = 16.2 and 16.6 for the 1685 and 1721 km s\u22121 absorbers respectively), our \"best guess\" model based upon\nthe constraints described in \u00a72.4. Finally, closest agreement with the observed column densities of N(Si II) and\nN(Si IV) is obtained by assuming log (Si/C) \u2248 +0.1,\nwhich is also compatible with the conclusions of T2002\nfor the absorber toward 3C 273. The range in ionization\nparameter consistent with the carbon line observations is\n\u22122.89 < log U < \u22122.65 for the gas at v \u2248 1685 km/s and\n\u22122.85 < log U < \u22122.76 for the gas at v \u2248 1721 km/s. This\nrange is also consistent with the N(Si II)/N(Si IV) column\ndensity ratio, so our one phase approximation likely remains a reasonable one. These ranges indicate the uncertainty in U, for a given metallicity or H I column density.\nTo explore the sensitivity of U to the H I column density\nand metallicity, we step through column density within\nthe range, log NHI = 14.7 \u2013 17.5 cm\u22122 , corresponding\nto a metallicity in the range 6 \u2013 0.005 Z\u2299 such that the\nabsolute column density of each metal ion is always consistent with the values in Table 2. The range in U is fairly\ninsensitive to NHI and Z; the expanded range becomes\n\u22122.9 < log U < \u22122.3 and \u22122.9 < log U < \u22122.4 for the gas\nat v \u223c 1685 and 1721 km s\u22121 respectively over this range\nof log NHI .\nFor a single-phase model, as suggested by the simplicity\nof the metal line profiles, the allowed range in ionization\nparameter may be translated into a range in density if\nthe intensity of the extragalactic ionizing background is\n\n\f6\nknown. Shull et al. (1999) estimate a mean intensity of\nJ\u03bd \u223c 1 \u00d7 10\u221223 ergs s\u22121 cm\u22122 ster\u22121 Hz\u22121 at one Rydberg\nby summing the contribution from quasars, which is consistent with J\u03bd calculated using more direct methods such\nas the low-z proximity effect, truncation of H I disks, and\nlimits on H-\u03b1 from extragalactic clouds (Bechtold 1994;\nShull et al. 1999; Maloney 1993; Weymann et al. 2001;\nDonahue, Aldering & Stocke 1995). The implied range in\nhydrogen density for these absorbers is nH = 1 \u2013 5 \u00d7 10\u22124\nand 1 \u2013 3 \u00d710\u22124 cm\u22123 for the v \u223c 1685 and 1721 km s\u22121\ncomponents respectively. These densities correspond to\noverdensities of \u03b4 \u223c 600 \u2013 3000 and 600 \u2013 1800 for the two\nabsorbers in units of the mean baryon density at z = 0.\nThese densities are an order of magnitude lower than those\ninferred for the gas towards 3C 273 (T2002).\n\ncally low b-values (see \u00a72.4). For the probable lower limit\non log NHI \u2265 16.0 cm\u22122 suggested by the FUSE detection\nof higher order Lyman lines, the metallicity of these struc< 10 \u2013 20% solar, in agreement with their\ntures must be \u223c\nlocation well away from the Virgo core.\n\nFig. 5.- The range in metallicity consistent with observed\ncolumn densities for photoionization models approximating the\nabsorber at 1685 km/s (upper panel) and at 1721 km/s (lower\npanel). The dotted curves show the model uncertainty in this\nrelation.\n\nFig. 4.- Calculated column density ratios versus ionization\nparameter U for models approximating the absorber at 1685\nkm s\u22121 (upper panel) and at 1721 km s\u22121 (lower panel). Solid\ncurves indicate the changing N(C II)/N(C IV) ratio and dotted\ncurves indicate the changing N(Si II)/N(Si IV) ratio. Solid [dotted]\nhorizontal lines indicate the 1\u03c3 uncertainty about the measured\nvalues of N(C II)/N(C IV) [N(Si II)/N(Si IV)]. The thick vertical\nlines indicate the range in Log U consistent with the observations\nof the N(C II)/N(C IV) ratio. As shown, the range in Log U is also\nconsistent with the N(Si II)/N(Si IV) ratios in the 1721 km s\u22121\nabsorber. The range in Log U in the 1685 km s\u22121 absorber is\nmarginally inconsistent with the N(Si II)/N(Si IV) ratios. We have\nchosen to use the more secure N(C IV)/N(C II) measurements to\nset the acceptable range in the ionization parameter.\n\nThe extent of the gas associated with the absorption,\nover the possible range of NHI or metallicity is 0.8 \u2212 50\nkpc. However, the requirement that our models reproduce\nthe absolute C II and C IV column densities, as well as\ntheir ratios, means that the NHI and metallicity for successful models are highly correlated, as shown in Figure\n5. Since the line of sight extent of the gas in our models\nis derived by dividing NHI by the mean hydrogen density,\nand since the range in mean hydrogen density compatible with line ratios varies slowly with NHI there is also a\ngood correlation of extent with assumed metallicity. Figure 6 shows the line of sight extent of the gas as a function\nof the assumed metallicity. Very large extents are possible only by invoking Z \u2264 10\u22122 Z\u2299 ; these low metallicities\nalso require log NHI > 17 cm\u22122 , which yield unrealisti-\n\nFig. 6.- Calculated line-of-sight extent versus metallicity\nparameter for models approximating the absorber at 1685 km s\u22121\n(upper panel) and at 1721 km s\u22121 (lower panel). The dotted lines\nrepresent the model uncertainty in this relation.\n\nFor our \"best guess\" model, log NHI = 16.2 and 16.6\ncm\u22122 , derived from the assumption of \u223c 6% solar abundances (consistent with the nearby 3C 273 absorber) we\nfind sizes along the line of sight of \u223c10 \u2013 30 kpc. The\nT2002 analysis of the 3C 273 absorber at the same velocity\ninfers an even smaller line-of-sight depth of only 70 pc. We\ncannot rule out that the column densities are an order of\nmagnitude higher than our \"best guess,\" with correspond-\n\n\f7\ning metallicities of \u22640.01Z\u2299, and much larger line of sight\nextents. However, the observations together with those\nanalyzed in T2002 suggest that a very thin (\u223c 10 kpc)\n\"ribbon or sheet\" of photoionized gas with abundances of\na few percent of solar extends for several hundreds of kpc\nthrough this region on the outskirts of the Virgo Cluster or\nthat there are several thin gaseous structures lying along\na large scale filament in this region. Given the expected\nvelocity dispersion of galaxies in the outskirts of a cluster like Virgo (100-300 km s\u22121 ), it is unlikely that a single\nthin \"ribbon\" would be dynamically stable for the length\n> 109 yrs).\nof time required to form it (\u223c\n4. galaxy identification in the vicinity of rx\n\nj1230.8+0115 and 3c 273\nOur knowledge of galaxies near the RX J1230.8+0115\nsight line at Virgo Cluster velocities comes from four\nsources: (1) an augmentation to the Center for Astrophysics (CfA) redshift survey (Grogin, Geller, & Huchra\n1998), (2) a pointed survey using Las Campanas Observatory (LCO) to obtain redshifts around 3C 273 (Morris et al. 1993), (3) two deep pointed surveys using\nmulti-object spectroscopy from the Wisconsin-IndianaYale-NOAO (WIYN) 3.5m1 and from the Las Campanas\nObservatory (LCO) Du Pont 2.5 telescopes (Stocke et al.\n2003), and (4) the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) early\ndata release (EDR, Stoughton et al. 2002). The pointed\ngalaxy surveys were designed to investigate the relationship between the Ly-\u03b1 forest absorption systems along\nthese sight lines and the galaxies.\nGrogin et al. (1998) obtained spectroscopic data to augment the CfA redshift survey in the 3C 273 region so that\nthe survey would be virtually complete down to mb \u2264\n15.7 (MB \u2264 -16.2 at 24.3 Mpc for cz= 1700 km s\u22121 ) in a\nregion bounded by 11.5h \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 13.5h and -3.5\u25e6 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264\n+8.5\u25e6 . This region includes both the 3C 273 and RX\nJ1230.8+0115 sight lines and extends several Mpc around\nthese sight lines at Virgo distances. The SDSS EDR spectroscopic survey includes a strip around the north Galactic\ncap at \u03b4 = 0\u25e6 that extends up to \u03b4 = 1.3\u25e6 , covering the\ndeclination of RX J1230.8+0115 but not the declination of\n3C 273. The nominal completeness limit for this spectroscopic survey is r < 17.8, at least two magnitudes fainter\nthan the augmented CfA survey in this region.\nMorris et al. (1993) also conducted a galaxy redshift survey around 3C 273 for which they claimed completeness\nto mB \u223c19 over a region with a 60\u2032 radius in RA and 40\u2032\nradius in DEC from the quasar. While RX J1230.8+0115\nis just beyond the southern edge of this survey region, it\nincludes galaxies up to \u223c 700h\u22121\n70 kpc to the north and\nwest of RX J1230.8+0115.\nMore recently, Stocke et al. (2003) have conducted a\nmulti-object spectroscopy survey in the region, including: (1) an LCO slit-mask spectroscopy survey around\nRX J1230.8+0115; (2) an LCO slit-mask survey around\n3C 273 to augment the Morris et al. (1993) observations;\nand (3) a WIYN/HYDRA fiber-fed spectroscopic survey\nin the region between 3C 273 and RX J1230.8+0115 centered at \u03b1 = 12.5h \u03b4 = +1.67\u25e6. A preliminary discussion\nof the observing setups, data reduction, and analysis of\n1\n\nthe LCO and WIYN data can be found in McLin et al.\n(2002). A more complete discussion of the techniques and\nresults for all sight lines observed will be presented later\n(Stocke et al. 2003). We review what has been done so far\nin the 3C 273/ RX J1230.8+0115 region by this on-going\nsurvey here:\n(1) The LCO observations surrounding RX\nJ1230.8+0115 consist of spectra for 43 galaxies, or \u223c 78%\nof the galaxies down to mB \u223c 20 (corresponding to MB \u2264\n-12 at the distance of the z = 0.005668 complex) out to a\nradius of 5\u2032 (36 h\u22121 kpc at this distance) from the target\nand 21% of the galaxies out to 15\u2032 . No galaxies were found\nat the redshifts of any of the Virgo Cluster absorbers, although several galaxies associated with absorbers behind\nVirgo were found.\n(2) The LCO slit mask spectroscopy around 3C 273 is\n100% complete down to mB \u223c19.5 out to a 10\u2032 radius.\nWe obtained redshifts for 5 galaxies that were missed by\nMorris et al. (1993), probably due to a classification error made by the automated galaxy-finding software employed (see Stocke et al. 2003) despite their claim of 100%\ncompleteness over a large region. Seventy-seven galaxies\nfainter than the Morris et al. (1993) magnitude limit were\nalso observed.\nOne of the five galaxies missed by Morris et al. (1993)\nis a relatively bright (MB = \u221214.5) galaxy 71h\u22121\n70 kpc\n\u22121\nfrom 3C 273 (360h70\nkpc from RX J1230.8+0115) at the\nredshift of the strong H I absorber (czabs =1589 km s\u22121 )\nanalyzed by T2002. This galaxy has the spectroscopic signatures of a \"post-starburst,\" a rare galaxy type in the\nlocal Universe. The starburst phase might be expected to\ncreate a substantial wind that could be responsible for a\nhigh-column density, low-ionization absorber like the one\npresent in the 3C 273 sight line (Stocke et al. 2003). While\nthis galaxy is too far from RX J1230.8+0115 to be related\nto the z = 0.005668 complex, the fact that this object was\nmissed by Morris et al. (1993) due to a classification error,\nsuggests that the region around RX J1230.8+0115 may not\nhave been surveyed well enough to declare that similar luminosity galaxies have not been missed. No other galaxies\nwere found in these observations at Virgo distances.\n(3) The WIYN/HYDRA observations concentrated on\nthe region between RX J1230.8+0115 and 3C 273, 0.9\u25e6 to\nthe north. The fiber setup for these observations was centered at RA = 12:30:00 and DEC = +01:40:00 (J2000.0)\nand redshifts were obtained for 81% of the galaxies within\na 20\u2032 radius of this position. A total of 38 galaxies were\nobserved successfully; only one galaxy was observed at\nboth WIYN and LCO as we worked to prevent duplication as much as possible. Thus, in the region north of\nRX J1230.8+0115, towards 3C 273, our galaxy survey is\n\u223c80% complete down to mB \u226418.7. No galaxies were\nfound at Virgo distances in the WIYN/HYDRA observations either.\nThe galaxy survey work should provide some confidence\nthat this region of space has been scrutinized exceptionally well for galaxies. There are 17 galaxies with cz \u2264\n2500 km s\u22121 now known in the region within 1 Mpc of either sight line. The SDSS (Stoughton et al. 2002) and\nthe Morris et al. (1993) galaxy survey work is almost com-\n\nThe WIYN Observatory is a joint facility of the University of Wisconsin \u2013 Madison, Indiana University, Yale University, and the National\nOptical Astronomy Observatories.\n\n\f8\npletely overlapping in the RX J1230.8+0115 region to an\nabsolute magnitude limit of MB \u2243 \u221214. The CfA and\nStocke et al. (2003) survey work suggests that all relatively bright galaxies (MB \u2264 \u221216) have been identified\nin the field and that only extremely faint (MB \u2264 \u221212),\nextremely compact, or extremely low surface brightness\ngalaxies could have been missed within 36h\u22121\n70 kpc of the\nsight line. A summary of the nearest galaxy to each of the\nabsorbers is included in Table 3, which lists by column:\n(1) target sight line; (2) Ly-\u03b1 absorber redshift (we list\nonly the centroid of the absorption blend modeled here);\n(3) the heliocentric absorber velocity in km s\u22121 ; (4) the\nvelocity difference in the sense of (Vabs - Vgal ) in km s\u22121 ;\n(5) the impact parameter in h\u22121\n70 Mpc; and (6) the name\nof the nearest galaxy to each absorber. The relationship\nbetween the Ly-\u03b1 absorbers and seven of these galaxies\nhas been discussed extensively by Penton et al. (2002).\nThe galaxy Leda 139866 is at 2329 km s\u22121 , just out of the\nvelocity range discussed by Penton et al. (2002), and the\n\"new galaxy\" is the post-starburst galaxy described briefly\nabove. The galaxy labeled [ISI96]1228+0116 is a very low\nsurface brightness dwarf irregular (MB \u2248 \u221213.6; Impey et\nal. 1996).\nTen of the 17 galaxies near RX J1230.8+0115 and\n3C 273 have recession velocities within \u00b1300 km s\u22121 of\nthe z = 0.005668 complex, but all are at substantial impact parameters (280 \u2013 520h\u22121\n70 kpc). The nearest galaxy\nis an edge-on spiral of modest luminosity (CGCG 014064; MB = -16.2) located 279h\u22121\n70 kpc away with a redshift nearly identical to that of one of the absorbers in\nthis complex. If the galaxies responsible for absorption at\nlarge impact parameters are expected to be bright, there is\na much brighter, face-on spiral (NGC 4517A; MB =-18.8)\na little further away, \u03c1= 365h\u22121\n70 kpc, with a larger velocity\ndifference (czgal = 1530 km s\u22121 ). On the other hand, it\nhas been argued that LSB galaxies may be responsible for\nmuch of the Ly-\u03b1 absorption that we see. There is an LSB\ngalaxy, discovered by Impey et al. (1988), in the field, but\nit is even further away in impact parameter (423h\u22121\n70 kpc)\nand velocity (cz = 1473 km s\u22121 ). However, the velocity\nis similar to that of the absorber at cz=1482 km s\u22121 (see\nTable 1). Identification of this LSB galaxy with the 1482\nkm s\u22121 absorber is problematic since there are three other\ngalaxies within \u00b1350 km s\u22121 that are similar distance or\ncloser to RX J1230.8+0115 on the sky.\n5. absorber sizes as inferred from line pair\n\nstatistics\nThe only \"direct\" measurement of the physical sizes of\nLy-\u03b1 absorbers comes from the statistical analysis of line\npairs in adjacent sight lines (see e.g., Foltz et al. 1984;\nDinshaw et al. 1997). In summarizing recent results,\nDinshaw et al. (1998) showed that the statistics of line\npairs suggest characteristic radii for high column density\n(log NHI \u2265 14.5 cm\u22122 ; i.e., higher column density than\nthe bulk of the Ly-\u03b1 forest) absorbers of 300-700h\u22121\n70 kpc\nfor spherical clouds, with a possible trend towards larger\nsizes at smaller redshifts. The lowest redshift previously\ninvestigated using this technique is one pair of sight lines\nat z \u223c0.5 (Dinshaw et al. 1997). The maximum likelihood analysis used on these pairs provides a range of radii\nextending more than a factor of two on either side of the\n\nvalues quoted above. However, all of the radius estimates\nare comparable to, or larger than, typical distances between bright galaxies. Thus, if these absorber radii are\ninterpreted as being \"contiguous\" structures, it is unlikely\nthat Ly-\u03b1 absorbers are physically or causally related to\nindividual galaxies since their sizes are comparable to or\nlarger than the distances between bright galaxies. These\nradii are more consistent with large-scale structure filaments found in numerical simulations (Dav\u00e9 et al. 1999).\nAdditionally, the observation that not all absorbers found\nin one sight line have corresponding absorption in the other\nsight line implies that these are elongated structures rather\nthan enormous spherical halos if the structures are \"contiguous.\" An alternative explanation is that coincident\nline pairs indicate \"correlated\" structures of smaller systems as in the case of galaxy halos aligned along a largescale structure filament (see discussion in Dinshaw et al.\n1994, 1997). This is suggested in several cases where substantial velocity and EW differences between coincident\nlines are noted (Dinshaw et al. 1994).\n\nFig. 7.- The 3C 273 (upper) and RX J1230.8+0115 (lower)\nspectra in the Virgo region. The ticks indicate the position of the\nabsorbers (solid \u2013 greater than 4-\u03c3, dotted \u2013 greater than 3.5-\u03c3)\nin each sight line. The smaller ticks indicate the positions of the\nmetal lines in the RX J1230.8+0115 spectrum. The crosses at\nthe top of the figure indicate the velocity ranges for the Virgo\ngalaxy \"clouds,\" which encompass most of the velocity space\ncovered by the absorbers. There is also general correspondence in\nvelocity between most of the absorption systems in the two lines-ofsight, yet the profiles and depths of the lines are extremely different.\n\nThe pairs analysis of these sight lines is consistent with\nthe inferences obtained from other sight line pairs (Bechtold 1994; Crotts et al. 1994; Dinshaw et al. 1997, 1998).\nFigure 7 shows the 3C 273 (upper) and RX J1230.8+0115\n(lower) spectra with the locations all > 4\u03c3 (solid ticks)\nand > 3.5\u03c3 (dotted tick) absorbers marked as well as the\nvelocity range for the two Virgo Supercluster \"clouds\" of\ngalaxies in this direction. We note that the line pairs we\nhave identified include absorbers with equivalent widths a\nfactor of 4 less than those identified in the higher redshift\nstudies of Dinshaw et al. (1997, 1998). Using the \u2206v \u2264\n150 km s\u22121 criteria for \"coincident\" line pairs suggested by\nDinshaw et al. (1997), two of the three 3C 273 absorbers\nare coincident with 4-\u03c3 absorbers in the other sight line\nand the third is coincident with a marginal detection. For\nRX J1230.8+0115, four of five are coincident by the Dinshaw et al. (1997) definition by counting the 1685 and\n1721 km s\u22121 absorbers as a single blended line and not-\n\n\f9\ning that the 1482 km s\u22121 absorber is also coincident with\nthe same absorber in the 3C 273 sight line (thus, 3 \"coincidences\" if this sort of double counting is not justified).\nIn either case, a large fraction of coincidences are present,\nsuggesting that transverse sizes are large for at least some\nof these absorbers. The transverse distances between the\nsight lines at these redshifts is 200-500h\u22121\n70 kpc, assuming a pure Hubble flow in this direction, comparable to\nthose investigated using other sight line pairs. The lowest velocity absorbers beyond Virgo (and thus at higher\nredshifts than shown in Figure 7) have no coincident absorbers in the other sight line (Penton et al. 2000a) for\ntransverse distances in the range 1.75-2.0h\u22121\n70 Mpc. These\ncoincidences indicate characteristic Ly-\u03b1 absorber radii of\n\u223c 100 \u2013 250h\u22121\n70 kpc. Unlike at higher redshifts, no chance\npairings are expected in this velocity interval, which could\nconfuse these issues. Using the line densities found by Penton et al. (2000b) at low H I column densities, we compute\nthat there should be 0.14 \u00b1 0.08 (a Poisson probability\nof 4\u00d710\u22124) line pairs with \u2206v \u2264 150 km s\u22121 created by\nchance in Figure 7. Thus, all the absorber matches seen\nin these two spectra are real (to 99.96% confidence) statistical associations of absorbers.\nThe only coincidence between the H I and O VI absorber at 1011 km s\u22121 in the 3C 273 sightline and an\nRX J1230.8+0115 is with the marginal detection at 889\nkm s\u22121 . While this is only a single incidence, a size limit of\n\u2264 225 h\u22121 kpc (the distance between these two sightlines\nat this redshift) supports the collisionally-ionized model\nfor this absorber advocated by T2002, because a photoionized model for this absorber requires a very large physical\nsize; i.e., we would expect a very large photoionized absorber to be more uniform over these two sight lines. As\nshown by examples in Tripp et al. (2001) and Tripp and\nSavage (2000), the simultaneous presence of O VI and absence of C IV absorption may be a discriminator between\ncollisionally-ionized and photoionized O VI absorbers.\nThe characteristic radii derived above are based on using the \u2206v \u2264 150 km s\u22121 criteria which was defined as\na \"coincidence\" for much poorer resolution Faint Object\nSpectrograph (FOS) spectra (\u2248 25 times poorer than the\npresent data). If these spectra were smoothed to the FOS\nresolution (Tripp, private communication), only one line\npair match and two mismatches would be found \u2013 the\nlower equivalent width lines in Figure 7 would not be detectable. The remaining coincidence includes the three\nmetal line absorbers at 1586 \u2013 1721 km s\u22121 , suggesting a\nsomewhat smaller but still substantial, characteristic size\nfor these structures. While the difference in these results\nis indicative of the resolution and sensitivity dependent\nnature of this measurement, we would still conclude that\nthese structures are large and elongated, comparable in\nsize to the distance between these two sight lines.\nAssuming that these absorbers reside in a gaseous filament with little turbulent motion, the Hubble flow velocity\ndifferences between absorbers in the two sight lines should\nbe in the range 30 \u2013 60 km s\u22121 . Therefore, despite the better STIS resolution and sensitivity, the \u2206v \u2264 150 km s\u22121\ncriterion for absorber coincidences still seems reasonable\nover such large separations. While line pair matches within\n150 km s\u22121 suggest a relationship between these absorber\npairs, the velocities, equivalent widths, and profile shapes\n\nare not so well correlated as to require \"contiguous\" structures stretching across these two sight lines (see e.g. Rauch\net al. 2001 examination of sub-kpc separated sight lines\nat high-z). However, we can not rule out the existence\nof a low column density (log NHI \u223c 13 cm\u22122 ) contiguous\nstructure, augmented at specific locations by higher column density gas; e.g., galaxy halos or winds embedded in\na large-scale gaseous filament. The presence of a galaxy\nat similar velocity to the 1586 km s\u22121 absorber and at a\nsmall impact parameter from 3C 273 (T2002 and Penton\net al. 2002) may be evidence for this interpretation.\nThe small number of absorbers found in these two sight\nlines and the possible \"special conditions\" of the Virgo\nCluster make statistical inference based upon this one sight\nline pair insecure. However, the approximate velocity coincidence between the metal line systems studied in detail\nhere and in T2002 strongly suggests that these absorbers\nare related. We discuss the sizes and shapes of the absorbers implied by these pairing further in the discussion\nsection.\n6. discussion and conclusions\n\nThe absorption line systems in the RX J1230.8+0115\nand 3C 273 sight lines along the Southern edge of the\nVirgo Cluster provide a low redshift laboratory in which\nto study the properties of these absorbers and their relationship with their environment. We have presented a\ndetailed discussion of the physical properties of these absorbers, concentrating on the characteristic sizes of low-z\nLy-\u03b1 absorbers. We summarize these results in the next\nsubsection. In \u00a76.2, we present an interpretation of the nature of these absorbers inferred from their properties and\nfrom the local environment of the Ly-\u03b1 absorption systems\nand present our conclusions about these absorbers.\n6.1. Properties of the Absorbers\nBased upon a detailed photoionization equilibrium\ncalculation, the two blended absorbers in the RX\nJ1230.8+0115 sight line at 1685 and 1721 km s\u22121 and the\n1586 km s\u22121 absorber in the 3C 273 sight line (T2002) have\ninferred sizes along the line-of-sight of \u223c20 kpc and 70 pc\nrespectively. These inferences are much more secure for\nthe 3C 273 absorber because the hydrogen column density\ncan be accurately determined due to available high quality\nFUSE spectroscopy of the higher order Lyman lines. For\nthe 3C 273 absorber, T2002 find log NHI = 15.85 cm\u22122 ,\nlog(nH ) = -2.8 \u00b10.3 cm\u22123 , Z = 0.06 Z\u2299 and an inferred\nthickness of \u223c70 pc. For the case of the two blended absorbers studied here, the combination of HST STIS echelle\nand FUSE spectroscopy are insufficient to provide similarly tight constraints. The FUSE spectrum is sufficient\nto rule out column densities as low as 1015 cm\u22122 and set a\nprobable lower limit of NHI = 1016 cm\u22122 for each absorber\ndue to significant detections of Ly-\u03b3 and Ly-\u03b4 in both components and possible detections of Ly-\u01eb, Ly-\u03b7 and Ly-\u03b8 in\nat least one component. Additionally, the low b-values\nthat would be required to fit Ly-\u03b1 rule out column densities above log NHI = 17.0 cm\u22122 .\nWe use the available STIS echelle and FUSE data to infer the physical conditions of these absorbers. The metal\nline ratios (N(C IV)/N(C II) and N(Si IV)/N(Si II)) constrain the ionization parameter (-2.85<log U <-2.60) for\n\n\f10\nour best-guess model, assuming the gas is photoionized.\nAssuming a standard value for the extragalactic ionizing\nradiation intensity, we can translate this to limits on the\ndensity of the gas. If we knew the metallicity of these\nstructures, this would constrain the hydrogen column density and thus the absorber size along our line-of-sight. By\nassuming the same metallicity for these absorbers as for\nthe 3C 273 absorber located some 350h\u22121\n70 kpc away and\ncolumn densities of log NHI = 16 \u2013 17, consistent with constraints from the STIS and FUSE data, we calculate lineof-sight sizes of 10 \u2013 30 kpc. Since these metallicities and\ncolumn densities are similar to those obtained by T2002,\nthe larger physical sizes obtained here are due to the higher\nionization (lower density) of the RX J1230.8+0115 absorbers (C IV is detected here, but not in 3C 273). The\nblended absorbers studied here have inferred line-of-sight\nsizes a factor of 7 \u2013 300 times less than the minimum\ntransverse size based upon detecting absorption in both\nsight lines at comparable redshifts, while the 1586 km s\u22121\nabsorber in 3C 273 has a size that is a factor of \u223c4300\nsmaller than the minimum transverse size. This much\nlarger inferred transverse size is more suggestive of objects\nassociated with large scale structure than with individual\ngalaxies, while the smaller line-of-sight sizes are more consistent with structures related to individual galaxies (e.g.,\nvery extended halos or outflowing winds).\nWhile only a few high column density absorbers similar\nto the ones in these two sight lines are known, they are\nnot unique at low-z. There is an absorber with a column\ndensity of log NHI \u223c16 cm\u22122 at z = 0.167 towards PKS\n0405-1219 (Chen & Prochaska 2000) and one with a column density of log NHI = 15.57 at z = 0.22497 towards\nH1821+643 (Tripp et al. 2000; Oegerle et el. 2000). Both of\nthese systems very closely resemble the RX J1230.8+0115\nz = 0.005668 complex in that they all contain a saturated absorber with a two component metal line system.\nThese absorbers also have nearby galaxies, there is an 0.02\n\u2217\nL\u2217K spiral galaxy at 90h\u22121\n70 kpc and a 1.2 LK elliptical at\n\u22121\n110h70 kpc from PKS 0405-1219 and there is a galaxy\n112h\u22121\n70 kpc away from the H1821+643 absorber. The difference between the RX J1230.8+0115 z = 0.005668 complex and these systems is the existence of higher ionization\nspecies detected with O VI and N V detected in PKS 04051219 and O VI and Si III detected in H1821+643.\nAt somewhat higher redshifts, Rigby, Charlton, &\nChurchill (2002) identify a class of weak Mg II systems\nwhich have similar physical properties to the absorbers\ndiscussed above including sizes on the order of 10 pc to\nseveral kpc. For the limited number of regions around\nthe absorbers that have been surveyed optically, there are\nno galaxies down to 0.01L\u2217 within 70h\u22121\n70 kpc, but larger\nregions around the absorbers have not been studied.\nWhile the lower ionization weak Mg II absorbers are\nmost similar to the absorbers studied here and in the\n3C 273 sight line, there are also more highly ionized metal\nline absorbers (i.e., O VI detected) that are found somewhat farther from galaxies, but that seem to be associated\nwith galaxy groups. The PKS 2155-304 sight line has 6\nabsorbers between 16,000 and 18,000 km s\u22121 , which appear to be associated with a small group of spiral galaxies,\nalthough none of these are within 400h\u22121\n70 kpc of the absorbers (Shull et al. 1998). Two of these absorbers have\n\nbeen detected in O VI with FUSE (Shull et al. 2003) and\nthere is a tentative detection of O VIII with CHANDRA\n(Fang et al. 2002). The two O VI absorbers in the PG\n0953+415 sight line (Savage et al. 2002) fall near peaks in\nthe galaxy density, with the z = 0.14232 absorber having\n4 galaxies within 130 km s\u22121 and 3 Mpc, the closest at\na projected distance of 395 kpc (Tripp & Savage 2000).\nSimilarly, the H1821+643 z = 0.1212 absorber appears\nto fall within a galaxy group, with 7 galaxies within 500\nkm s\u22121 and 3.1 Mpc. These higher ionization absorbers\nhave larger inferred line-of-sight sizes than those discussed\nabove (based on a photoionization model). However, since\nthere are no adjacent sight lines, there are no constraints\non their transverse sizes.\nWe note that the column densities of the absorbers studied here are unusually high for the bulk of the local Ly-\u03b1\nforest absorbers and so are probably not representative of\nthe properties (size, metallicity, etc.) or the environment\nof the lower column density lines (log NHI < 14 cm\u22122 ;\nPenton et al. 2002).\n6.2. Galaxy/Absorber Associations and Large Scale\nStructure\nPenton et al. (2002) examined the hypothesis that the\n3C 273 and RX J1230.8+0115 absorbers at Virgo distance\nare due to extended galaxy halos and concluded that the\nevidence was inconsistent with the available data. Based\nupon the known galaxy redshifts, the nearest galaxies to\nthe strong absorbers in these sight lines were \u2265200h\u22121\n70 kpc\naway and there seemed to be no correlation between impact parameter and the probability of detecting absorption\nas would be expected in a simple halo model. The galaxy\nredshift surveys have been improved and a dwarf galaxy\nhas been found only 71h\u22121\n70 kpc from the 3C 273 1586\nkm s\u22121 absorber (Stocke et al. 2003). Finding this galaxy\nmay indicate that the halos of dwarf galaxies or outflows\nfrom them are responsible for some Ly-\u03b1 absorbers. The\n\"post-starburst\" signature in the optical spectrum of this\ngalaxy makes an outflow model for the 3C 273 absorber\nparticularly attractive since it can explain the sub-solar\nmetal abundances as well as the super-solar (Si/C) ratio,\nwhich is indicative of SN type II enrichment.\nThe RX J1230.8+0115 z = 0.005668 complex could\nbe associated with a gas-rich galaxy (H I 1225+01) 400\nkm s\u22121 and 270h\u22121\n70 kpc away, or with the edge-on dwarf\n\u22121\nspiral (CGCG 014-064) 280h\u22121\n70 kpc and only 56 km s\n\u22121\naway. The fact that the dwarf galaxy 71h70 kpc from\n3C 273 was missed by Morris et al. (1993) provides a\nwarning that the RX J1230.8+0115 region may not have\nbeen surveyed sufficiently well to conclude that there are\nno galaxies of similar luminosity near these blended absorbers, although there have been a number of relatively\ndeep, independent surveys of this region. If another faint\ngalaxy is found close to RX J1230.8+0115 at cz \u223c1700\nkm s\u22121 , then the model of outflowing winds from dwarf\ngalaxies (Stocke et al. 2003) is an exceptional fit for both\nthe 3C 273 and RX J1230.8+0115 cz \u223c1700 km s\u22121 absorbers (Stocke et al. 2003). The higher than average\ngalaxy density (\u2248 50 times the average) in this region at\nthe southern edge of the Virgo Cluster make this a reasonable possibility. However, this scenario may require very\nlarge amounts of H I associated with quite small galaxies\n\n\f11\n(see below and Stocke et al. 2003 for further discussion).\nRX J1230.8+0115 is 0.9\u25e6 from 3C 273, and both of these\nlines-of-sight pass through a filament of galaxies identified\nby Penton et al. (2002) as well as passing through the\nSouthern Extension of Virgo and near the W cloud (the\nW' cloud, discussed as part of this region by T2002 lies\nseveral degrees to the north; Binggeli et al. 1993). These\ngalaxy clouds are thought to be independent of the Virgo\nCluster. The W cloud is a large feature that may be another filament stretching to the north at higher velocities\nthan are found in the Penton et al. (2002) filament. However, the SE cloud is embedded in the northern end of this\nfilament. Penton et al. (2002) showed that both of the\nstrong 3C 273 Virgo absorbers, all of the RX J1230.8+0115\nVirgo absorbers, plus the seven (now eight) known galaxies in the region all lie along a single large-scale structure\nfilament that could extend for many Mpc crossing these\nsight lines.\nThe filamentary model for these absorbers is consistent\nwith the abundance of common velocity (\u00b1 150 km s\u22121 )\nabsorber pairs seen in these two sight lines but not with the\nline-of-sight thicknesses of these structures inferred from\nphotoionization models. Either the methods used to estimate absorber sizes could be wrong, a very thin \"ribbon\" or \"sheet\" of gas could extend along this filament of\ngalaxies for at least several hundred kpc, or, because the\npairs analysis cannot distinguish between \"contiguous\" or\n\"correlated\" structures as emphasized by its practitioners\n(Dinshaw et al. 1997), these absorbers map out correlated\nrather than contiguous structures. Given the difference in\ndepth versus transverse size for these absorbers, and the\nlack of detailed correlations between the absorber properties (i.e., velocity differences greater than \u00b1 50 km s\u22121 ,\nwhich could be accounted for by Hubble flow, as well as\nlarge equivalent width differences; see \u00a75) in these two\nsight lines, a correlated structure model seems much more\nplausible. One possibility is that the absorbers in this correlated structure are related to individual galaxies whose\nhalos or outflowing winds have caused significant clumping\nand metal enrichment in small regions of the large gaseous\nstructure in which they are embedded. If this is the case,\nwe might expect to find one or more faint galaxies close to\nthe RX J1230.8+0115 Virgo absorbers.\nThe high resolution STIS echelle spectra, shown in Figure 7, indicate that there is no detailed correlation between\nthe velocities or the equivalent widths of the absorbers in\nthese sight lines. These differences in velocity and equivalent width structure contrast with the extremely detailed\nvelocity and equivalent width correlations between the\nLy\u03b1 absorbers in the two gravitationally-lensed images of\nQ1422+231 (Rauch et al. 2001) separated by 80h\u22121\n70 parsecs at z = 3.3. In the case of the Q1422+231 absorbers\nthere is a detailed agreement between these absorber properties, requiring a quiescent, contiguous gaseous structure (Rauch et al. 2001). The differences between the\nQ1422+231 sight lines and these sight lines may indicate\nthe difference in scale over which we see contiguous structures (tens of parsecs) and correlated structures (hundreds\nof kpc).\nIf we assume that the absorber depths of 1 \u2013 30 kpc\ncalculated in \u00a73 and in T2002 are indicative of the overall\nthree-dimensional size of these absorbers, then, in order\n\nto obtain a covering factor of unity (as would be required\nto detect three such absorbers in the two sight lines observed), there would need to be 10 to 10,000 of these structures in the filament (assuming a filament thickness of \u223c\n100 kpc). Charlton et al. (2002) also find that a large\nnumber of weak Mg II absorbing structures are required\nto explain their detected population found at higher redshifts; i.e., these absorbers must greatly outnumber bright\ngalaxies. Although not yet observed at Mg II, the three\nabsorbers discussed here are very similar to those studied\nby Charlton et al. (2002). If these absorbers are associated with galaxies, we would expect to find numerous\nfaint or low surface brightness galaxies throughout this filament. While we make the case in \u00a76 that some galaxies\nmay have been missed, this filament has been thoroughly\nsurveyed for galaxies and only 8 have been found. It is\nvery hard to believe that large numbers of star formation\nsites have been missed given the volume of galaxy redshift\ndata available for this region (\u00a74).\nOne possible scenario is that while these absorbers have\nsmall thicknesses, they could be quite extended on the sky\nif the metal enriched gas is in the form of a thin shell\nsurrounding a galaxy, perhaps driven by a wind. In this\ncase, the area on the sky would be substantially larger\nthan the thickness derived from photoionization; e.g., the\nradius of the shell could extend 50 \u2013 100h\u22121 kpc from\nthe galaxy if the distance to the galaxy near the 3C 273\nabsorber is indicative of the size of these shells (impact\nparameter = 71h\u22121 kpc; \u00a74 and Stocke et al. 2003). In\nthis case, only a few (\u223c4) gaseous shells would be required\nto have the covering fraction of unity necessitated by the\n3C 273/RX J1230.8+0115 observations. In the shell scenario, it would also be quite natural to find two absorbers\nclosely spaced in velocity along a single sight line (e.g.,\nRX J1230.8+0115) due to the interception of both sides of\nthe expanding shell of gas. For a 75 kpc radius shell with\nan expansion velocity of 18 km s\u22121 (the separation between\nthe RX J1230.8+0115 metal lines) the epoch of star formation would have occured \u223c 4 \u00d7 109 yrs ago expelling\n7 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 of gas (given the average RX J1230.8+0115\ngas density and shell thickness). Thus, the galaxy putatively associated with the enriched gas in these absorbers\ndoes not need to be currently forming stars. This is the\ncase for the dwarf near the 3C 273 absorber (Stocke et al.\n2003), which would have had to expel \u223c 2 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 of\ngas in this scenario. This scenario requires large masses of\ngas to have been expelled from galaxies, but may be compelling if another galaxy is found near RX J1230.8+0115.\nGiven the significant amount of optical spectroscopy already expended on this region, it may be more likely that\nthe column density of the absorber is on the high end of our\nrange, making the metallicity significantly smaller. In this\nlower metallicity scenario, these systems could represent\nmore primordial overdensities expected to be associated\nwith large scale structure (Dav\u00e9 et al. 1999; Stocke et al.\n2001; Penton et al. 2002). Given the proximity of these\nabsorbers to us, this region is the best available laboratory with which to test this hypothesis so we are presently\nsurveying the region at the 21cm line of H I to look for gasrich galaxies as well as continuing our optical spectroscopy\nto answer this question definitively.\n\n\f12\nJLR thanks Steve Penton for assistance extracting and\ncalibrating the RX J1230.8+0115 STIS spectrum and Ken\nSembach for input on the FUSE spectrum.
