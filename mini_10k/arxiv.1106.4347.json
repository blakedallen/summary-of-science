Baryon (B) and lepton (L) number\nare conserved as global symmetries of the Standard Model (SM) and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). However, global symmetries in a theory can easily\nappear by accident, and unless they are protected in some way, are broken at some level\nby nonperturbative effects. Indeed, one of the distinctive features of grand unified theories\n(GUTs) is their introduction of new particles that can mediate proton decay. A typical\nnon-supersymmetric GUT with arbitrary couplings of natural size allows proton decay at an\nunacceptably high rate, which [in addition to the taming of the gauge hierarchy problem and\nthe numerical improvement of SU(3)C \u00d7SU(2)L \u00d7U(1)Y gauge unification] provides impetus\nfor the study of supersymmetric (SUSY) theories. In particular, the scale at which unification occurs in SUSY models is pushed to a slightly higher energy, leading to an additional\nsuppression of the proton decay rate.\nHowever, unmodified SUSY theories generate their own problems with B and L nonconservation. While B- and L-violating terms in non-SUSY theories first appear in operators of\ndimension d = 6, the presence of squark and slepton fields allows such terms to arise already\nat d = 4. Denoting the left-handed chiral matter and Higgs superfields by the quantum\nnumbers of B, L, and SU(3)C \u00d7SU(2)L \u00d7U(1)Y in the usual way,\nQ(+ 31 , 0, 3, 2, + 61 ) , L(0, +1, 1, 2, \u2212 21 ) , U c (\u2212 13 , 0, 3, 1, \u2212 23 ) , D c (\u2212 31 , \u22121, 3, 1, + 31 ) ,\nN c (\u22121, 0, 1, 1, 0) , E c (\u22121, 0, 1, 1, +1) , Hu (0, 0, 1, 2, + 21 ) , Hd (0, 0, 1, 2, \u2212 21 ) ,\n\n(1.1)\n\none finds already at d = 4 several B- and L-violating operators, such as N c N c N c and QD c L\n(where the necessary color and weak isospin contractions are implied). Conventional R\nparity [1\u20135], which may be defined operationally on MSSM fields as (\u22121)3(B\u2212L)+2J , eliminates\nsuch terms while protecting the conventional Yukawa terms such as LHu N c . Nevertheless,\neven with this restriction Refs. [3, 6] showed that d = 5 operators such as QQQL still lead\nto an unacceptably short proton lifetime unless additional suppressions are introduced.\nA classic study [7] of possible B- and L-violating operators at d = 4 and 5 and how various discrete symmetries may be used to suppress phenomenologically unacceptable (\"dangerous\") decay rates also summarizes which of these operators are especially dangerous by\n1\n\n\fproviding estimates of their suppressed coefficients. While the number of such operators\nincreases greatly after allowing the right-handed neutrino field N c [8] (which was not considered in [7]; we count 36 B- and/or L-violating operators up to and including d = 5), one\ncan check that none of them are singlets under a symmetry that assigns a charge QX = \u22121\nto Q and L, +1 to U c , D c , N c , and E c , and 0 to Hu,d [for example, such a symmetry can\noccur as a subgroup of a hypothetical U(1)X , as seen below]. On the other hand, the \u03bc\nterm Hu Hd and the standard Yukawa terms are all singlets under this symmetry, indicating\na potential route for suppressing proton decay without recourse to R parity.\nGoing beyond global symmetries, one may consider gauging the symmetries U(1)B or\nU(1)L that count baryon and lepton numbers, respectively, either for its own phenomenological interest in collider physics [9], or as a method of providing interesting dark matter\ncandidates in both non-SUSY [10] and SUSY [11] models. So-called leptophilic matter\n[having a U(1) charge that couples preferentially to leptons rather than quarks, but not necessarily just U(1)L ] can serve to explain [12] the observed PAMELA [13]/ATIC [14]/Fermi\nLAT [15] cosmic ray positron excess, while a relatively light leptophobic [coupling primarily\nto quarks rather than leptons, but not necessarily just U(1)B ] Z \u2032 can serve to explain [16]\nTevatron anomalies in the measured tt\u0304 forward-backward asymmetry [17] and the associated\nproduction of W s with jets [18]. Introducing additional Abelian symmetries beyond those\nof the SM or MSSM requires the consideration of a variety of new potential anomalies and\nthe addition of new chiral matter multiplets to enforce their cancellation; addressing such\nconcerns accounts for much of the analysis in the models mentioned above.\nThe introduction of almost any extra gauged U(1) that contains a portion coupling universally to quarks [i.e., U(1)B ] leads to the prohibition of proton decay at energy scales such\nthat the symmetry remains unbroken. Since the proton is the lightest fermionic hadron, its\ndecay products must contain an odd number of leptons, and some potential combinations\nincluding U(1)B , such as U(1)B\u2212L (if present), would have to break at a somewhat higher\nscale than others in order to support the experimental lifetime limit. Indeed, such possibilities have been considered for decades [19]. However, demanding baryon number to be an\nexactly conserved quantity at all scales would also eliminate the possibility of baryogenesis\nand a natural resolution of the problem of matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe.\nAnalogous to the possibility that unconstrained operators can generate excessively large\nproton decay but their complete elimination forbids mechanisms for generating baryogenesis,\n2\n\n\fthe \u03bc-term coupling also introduces a well-known difficulty [1] in the MSSM: The natural\nPlanck- or string-scale value of \u03bc would force comparable values for the Higgs masses, and\ntherefore must be suppressed. However, if \u03bc is taken too small, light charginos appear in\nmass ranges that have already been excluded by collider searches. In the original solution [1],\nSUSY is explicitly but softly broken by the \u03bc term in the TeV range; however, one may also\nconsider the possibility of \u03bc arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking. An efficient model\nof beyond-MSSM physics addresses both issues, as in Refs. [8, 20]. Indeed, both of these\npapers also note (as suggested above) a diminished significance for R parity. Moreover,\nanother prime motivation for R parity-the existence of a lightest SUSY particle as a dark\nmatter candidate-is ameliorated if one has recourse to other selection rules based upon\nadditional U(1) symmetries to produce other long-lived exotic particles.\nUnder what circumstances can one develop theories with nonanomalous U(1)s that help\nto stabilize the proton? Here too, one can find interesting observations in the literature.\nAs noted in Refs. [21, 22], the desired U(1)s do not appear to fit into conventional SO(10)\nor E6 -type grand unification schemes. Amusingly, the former paper (by Pati) advocates\na stringy origin for the extra U(1), while the latter paper (inspired by results of explicit\nmodels [23, 24]) advocates a Pati-Salam (left-right symmetric) scheme [25] as the origin of\nthe extra U(1). The model we present here, as it turns out, supports both stringy and\nPati-Salam ideas. The possibility of suppressing proton decay using a left-right symmetric\nheterotic string-derived U(1) is considered in Refs. [26, 27], and a fourth generation in\nheterotic string theory is considered in Refs. [28, 29].\nFurthermore, cancelling the anomalies of the U(1) associated with the suppression of\nproton decay appears to be more natural in models that introduce an additional set of chiral\nfermions; Ref. [20] includes a full family of fermions with opposite chiralities to those of the\nSM, but also notes that similar cancellations are possible in a four-generation MSSM. The\npotential significance of four generations in this context is also explored in Refs. [30, 31]. This\nis precisely the scenario we propose here. While long considered phenomenologically unlikely,\nthe existence of a complete fourth generation of light chiral fermions in the range of 100\u2013\n600 GeV to be detected at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) remains a very real possibility,\nan idea recently revived in Ref. [32]. As one might expect, the masses and mixings of such\nnew fermions must satisfy a variety of constraints arising from direct searches, electroweak\nprecision constraints, and perturbative unitarity, but substantial regions in parameter space\n3\n\n\fremain for their discovery, all accessible to the LHC.\nIn light of these phenomenological possibilities, in recent papers [33, 34] we have developed two 4-generation models in Type IIA string theory using D6-branes intersecting\non a T 6 /(Z2 \u00d7 Z2 ) orientifold. Our interest in both cases was to explain the hierarchy of\nmasses and mixings among the known fermions. In the first model [33], we obtained full\nrank-4 Yukawa matrices at the level of trilinear couplings, but fitting the large hierarchies in\nmasses and mixings required the adjustable vacuum expectation values (VEVs) and openstring moduli to lie in very particular regions of parameter space. The second model [34],\nwhich is of direct interest for this paper, generates Yukawa matrices only of rank 2 at trilinear\norder: Only the heaviest two generations obtain masses at this order, while the lighter two\ngenerations obtain masses via higher-order effects, which arguably provides a better physical\nexplanation for facts such as, e.g., mt /me \u2248 340,000. Moreover, natural solutions simultaneously accommodating the known third-generation fermion masses and the constraints on\nthe fourth-generation fermion masses are relatively easy to obtain in the model of [34].\nFor the reader unfamiliar with the details of building consistent string theory-based models containing the MSSM, the essential points are to obtain a compactification of the extra\n6 spacetime dimensions that supports just the low-energy particle content of the theory and\nto develop mechanisms for eliminating any unwanted states arising from residual degrees of\nfreedom. The gauge-group charges and multiplicities are determined by the geometry (angles and numbers of intersections in Type IIA) through which strings wrap the compactified\ndimensions. The requirement of SUSY, the elimination of anomalies, and the imposition of\nthe Green-Schwarz mechanism [35] to allow for massless U(1) gauge symmetries (all essential to the topic of this paper) may all be expressed using simple well-known constraints in\nterms of the wrapping numbers, brane multiplicities, and form of the compactified space,\nparticularly for the simple geometry of the 6-torus orientifold T 6 /(Z2 \u00d7 Z2 ).\nAs mentioned above, our construction uses a Pati-Salam (PS) SU(4)C \u00d7SU(2)L \u00d7SU(2)R\nscheme to obtain fermions of the correct charges: Branes a, b, and c carry color/lepton,\nright-chiral, and left-chiral charges, respectively. Unification of the low-energy MSSM gauge\ngroup SU(3)C \u00d7SU(2)L \u00d7U(1)Y occurs in an efficient and natural way, which in turn is made\npossible because U(1)Y remains massless and anomaly free by surviving the GS mechanism.\nHowever, the two models [33, 34] differ in one very distinctive manner: In the former, the\nonly such nonanomalous U(1)s at the string scale (as is typical to PS constructions) are\n4\n\n\fU(1)B\u2212L and U(1)I3R , from which U(1)Y = 21 U(1)B\u2212L +U(1)I3R . However, the latter model\ngenerates an additional nonanomalous U(1)X coupling to the MSSM fields with precisely\nthe charges described above. The crucial observation is that the combinations\n1\n1\n3\n1\nU(1)B \u2261 \u2212 U(1)X + U(1)B\u2212L , U(1)L \u2261 \u2212 U(1)X \u2212 U(1)B\u2212L\n4\n4\n4\n4\n\n(1.2)\n\nare nonanomalous U(1)s surviving at the string scale that, when acting on MSSM fields,\nprecisely count baryon and lepton number, respectively. These remarkable features appear\ndue to a confluence of a PS construction, the presence of four chiral fermion generations,\nand trilinear Yukawa matrices of less-than-full rank.\nIn this paper we consider the broad phenomenological consequences of the enhanced symmetries of this model. In Sec. II we exhibit beyond-MSSM operators that can contribute\nto proton decay, reprise the field content of the model of Ref. [34], and investigate which\noperators survive due to U(1)X conservation, while we consider the nature of the new symmetry in Sec. III. The phenomenology induced by the new symmetry is discussed in Sec IV:\nsuppression of proton decay, the \u03bc term, the right-handed neutrino Majorana mass term,\nand baryogenesis. Section V emphasizes the prospects for new physics in these models, and\nSec. VI offers concluding thoughts.\n\nII.\n\nPROTON STABILITY AND AN EXTRA GAUGED U(1)\n\nAlthough supersymmetry provides an elegant solution to the gauge hierarchy problem,\nit introduces some additional complications. First among these is the rapid decay of the\nproton through the pair of d = 4 F -term operators (B- and L-violating, respectively):\nU c D c D c , QD c L .\n\n(2.1)\n\nThis problem is usually solved in the MSSM by introducing R parity, under which the known\nfermions are even while their SUSY partners are odd (or the related \"matter parity\", under\nwhich R = +1 for Q, U c, D c, L, E c, N c and R = \u22121 for Hu,d ). As a bonus, R parity leads\nto a stable lightest SUSY particle (LSP), which is a natural candidate for dark matter.\nAlthough this idea is attractive, it is well known that a gauged U(1)B\u2212L also forbids the\nd = 4 operators, and furthermore, R parity [more specifically, matter parity (\u22121)3(B\u2212L) ] can\nresult from U(1)B\u2212L broken spontaneously to its discrete Z2 subgroup [19, 36, 37].\n5\n\n\fEven though the problem of rapid proton decay via d = 4 operators can be eliminated\nthrough this mechanism, one still faces the problem of d = 5 operators that allow for\nproton decay with a lifetime too short to evade current experimental constraints unless the\ncoefficients of these operators are chosen to be sufficiently small. First among these are\nsingle operators that allow (at least in principle) proton decay and preserve B \u2212 L:\n[QQQL]F , [U c U c D c E c ]F , [D c D c U c N c ]F .\n\n(2.2)\n\nThe second set consists of relevant d = 5 operators that violate either B or L separately,\nwhich combine with the appropriate member of Eq.

At the string scale, it is a four-generation Pati-Salam (PS) model,\nwith the gauge symmetry of the \"observable\" sector given by\nU(4)C \u00d7 U(2)L \u00d7 U(2)R ,\n\n(2.4)\n\nin addition to a \"hidden\" sector with the gauge group USp(8)3 . Since U(N) = SU(N)\u00d7U(1),\neach observable gauge group has an associated anomalous U(1), denoted here as U(1)4 ,\nU(1)2L , and U(1)2R , respectively (which correspond to the a, b, and c brane stacks, respectively). The anomalies of these Abelian symmetries are cancelled by a generalized\nGreen-Schwarz mechanism, and as a result their gauge bosons obtain string-scale masses.\nHowever, these U(1)s remain as global symmetries to all orders in perturbation theory, and\nas a result perturbatively forbid operators that would otherwise be allowed.\nAs noted in [34], precisely one linear combination of U(1)4 , U(1)2L , and U(1)2R remains\nmassless and anomaly free, which is given by\nU(1)X \u2261 U(1)4 + 2 [U(1)2L + U(1)2R ] .\n6\n\n(2.5)\n\n\fTABLE I: The chiral and vectorlike superfields, and their multiplicities and quantum numbers\nunder the gauge symmetry U(4)C \u00d7 U(2)L \u00d7 U(2)R \u00d7 [USp(8)1 \u00d7 USp(8)2 \u00d7 USp(8)3 ].

As seen\nthere, the superfields FLi (QL , LL ) carry charge U(1)X charge QX = \u22121, FRi (QR , LR ) (= U c ,\nD c , N c , E c ) carry charge QX = +1, and the Higgs superfields are uncharged under U(1)X ,\nas promised in the Introduction. Thus, the Yukawa couplings\nWY = yijk FLi FRj H k\n\n(2.7)\n\nu\nd\n\u03bd\nl\n= yijk\nQi (U c )j Huk + yijk\nQi (D c )j Hdk + yijk\nLi (N c )j Huk + yijk\nLi (E c )j Hdk ,\n\nwhere i, j, k = {1, 2, 3, 4}, are allowed by both the global U(1) symmetries as well as the\ngauged U(1)X symmetry. As shown in [34], the resulting Yukawa matrices are rank 2,\nwhich allows for fermion mass textures that can easily satisfy constraints placed on fourthgeneration fermion masses. Since the fields FL and FR have different U(1)X charges, these\nfields obviously cannot be placed in the same spinorial 16 of SO(10). Thus, this PS model\ncannot have an SO(10) origin.\nAs can also easily be checked using Table I, none of the d = 4 and d = 5 operators given in\nEqs. (2.1), (2.2), and (2.3) are singlets under U(1)X (Nor, it should be added, are any of the\nremaining 21 operators of the set of 36 mentioned in the Introduction, all of which are purely\nL-violating). Indeed, since U(1)X (Q) = +1, U(1)X (U c , D c ) = \u22121, U(1)X (Hu , Hd ) = 0, one\nfinds that it is not possible to create a B-violating U(1)X -singlet d \u2264 6 operator without\nincluding exotic matter. Thus, B- and L-violating processes that proceed via these operators\nare effectively forbidden at scales where U(1)X remains unbroken.\nAs mentioned in the previous section, the MSSM superfields are also charged under global\nsymmetries that arise from anomalous U(1)s whose gauge bosons obtain masses via the\ngeneralized Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism. As can be seen from Table I,\nnone of the dimension-4 and -5 operators that mediate proton decay are singlets under these\nglobal symmetries, and are thus perturbatively forbidden. However, these global symmetries\ncan, in principle, be broken by nonperturbative effects, namely D-brane instantons [41\u201343],\nassuming that suitable instantons with the correct zero-mode structure and satisfying all\nconstraints can actually arise.\nIf such suitable instantons are present in the model, then proton decay can be allowed via\nthese operators, albeit at a rate exponentially suppressed by the instanton action. While it\n8\n\n\fmight be possible for the instanton suppression to be large enough to allow proton decay at\nan acceptable rate, this scenario is by no means guaranteed. However, for the present model,\nthese operators cannot be induced via D-brane instantons since the U(1)X gauge symmetry\nremains unbroken at the string scale. Therefore, proton decay via these operators is forbidden at scales where U(1)X remains unbroken, and highly suppressed at scales at which\nU(1)X is broken since the effects by which they may appear are perturbatively forbidden.\n\nIII.\n\nTHE U(1)L - AND U(1)B -EXTENDED MSSM'S\n\nThe PS gauge symmetry may be broken by a process of D6-brane splitting [44, 45],\nwhich corresponds to assigning VEVs to some of the adjoint scalars associated with each\nstack along its flat directions (See [34] for a more detailed discussion of the process for this\nmodel). For present purposes, we note that the splitting results in additional massless and\nanomaly-free U(1)s given by\n1\nU(1)baryon \u2212 U(1)lepton ,\n3\n1\n1\n= U(1)up \u2212 U(1)down ,\n2\n2\n\nU(1)B\u2212L =\nU(1)I3R\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhile U(1)X becomes\nU(1)X = U(1)baryon + U(1)lepton + 2 [U(1)2L + U(1)up + U(1)down ]\n= U(1)a1 + U(1)a2 + 2 [U(1)b + U(1)c1 + U(1)c2 ] ,\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere U(1)baryon =U(1)a1 and U(1)lepton =U(1)a2 are global U(1)s obtained from U(1)4 =U(1)a\nafter brane splitting, under which baryons and leptons are charged, respectively. Similarly,\nU(1)up =U(1)c1 is a global symmetry under which up-type quarks and neutrinos are charged,\nwhile down-type quarks and electrically-charged leptons are charged under the global symmetry U(1)down =U(1)c2 , both obtained from U(1)2R =U(1)b after brane splitting. Typically\nin this type of model, the charges of the quarks and leptons under these global (and indeed,\nanomalous) symmetries are identified as 13 U(1)baryon and U(1)lepton , respectively. However,\nas we now show, in this model one finds it is possible to obtain gauged U(1)s under which\nthe quarks and leptons have numerically identical charges, that we label as the true baryon\nnumber (B) and lepton number (L), respectively. In particular, when acting upon MSSM\nfields, the U(1)X gauge symmetry is effectively \u2212U(1)3B+L .\n9\n\n\fAfter brane splitting, the observable gauge symmetry of the model becomes SU(3)C \u00d7\nSU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L \u00d7 U(1)I3R \u00d7 U(1)3B+L , with U(1)B\u2212L , U(1)I3R , and U(1)3B+L = \u2212U(1)X\nas defined in Eq. (3.1). Since both U(1)B\u2212L and U(1)3B+L remain good symmetries, one\nimmediately sees why none of the B and L-violating operators that mediate proton decay\nin the MSSM are allowed: Equation (1.2) is equivalent to the trivial identities\n1\nU(1)B = [U(1)B\u2212L + U(1)3B+L ] ,\n4\n\n1\nU(1)L = [\u22123U(1)B\u2212L + U(1)3B+L ] ,\n4\n\n(3.3)\n\nthat, when acting on MSSM fields, serve the promised role of precisely counting baryon and\nlepton number, respectively. The relation between the global and gauged forms is given by\nU(1)B = U(1)baryon + U(1)\u2206 ,\nU(1)L = U(1)lepton + U(1)\u2206 ,\n\n(3.4)\n\n1\nU(1)\u2206 = \u2212 [3U(1)baryon + U(1)lepton + U(1)2L + U(1)up + U(1)down ]\n2\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere\n\nis also an anomalous U(1), but under which no MSSM field is charged.\nThe fact that two equivalent combinations of U(1)B\u2212L and U(1)3B+L precisely count\nB and L indicates that both U(1)B and U(1)L remain gauged as long as both parent\nsymmetries remain unbroken. One may ask how the full gauge symmetry may be further broken to yield the individual combinations shown in Eq. (3.3). As an example,\nfirst note that the U(1)B\u2212L \u00d7 U(1)I3R gauge symmetry may be broken to the SM hypercharge U(1)Y by assigning VEVs to the vectorlike singlet fields \u03a6, \u03a6 (from the a2 c\u20322 intersections) carrying the quantum numbers (1, 1, 12 , \u22121, \u22123) and (1, 1, \u2212 12 , 1, 3) under the\nSU(3)C \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)I3R \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L \u00d7 U(1)3B+L gauge symmetry. Since \u03a6, \u03a6 carry\nnonzero charges under both U(1)B\u2212L and U(1)I3R , the two gauge symmetries are broken,\nbut the fields are uncharged under the linear combination\n1\n[U(1)baryon \u2212 3U(1)lepton + 3U(1)up \u2212 3U(1)down ]\n6\n1\n= [U(1)a1 \u2212 3U(1)a2 + 3U(1)c1 \u2212 3U(1)c2 ]\n6\n1\n= U(1)B\u2212L + U(1)I3R ,\n2\n\nU(1)Y =\n\n(3.6)\n\ncorresponding to the SM hypercharge, which then remains unbroken. In addition, these\nvectorlike fields carry charges under the U(1)3B+L gauge symmetry and so it is also broken.\n10\n\n\fHowever, these fields do not carry charges under the linear combination corresponding to\nU(1)L given in Eq. (3.3), and thus it survives. Therefore, at this stage, the gauge symmetry\nof the observable sector is given by\nSU(3)C \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y \u00d7 U(1)L ,\n\n(3.7)\n\njust the gauge symmetry of the MSSM, extended by an extra U(1) that counts L.\nMany alternate scenarios for symmetry breaking are possible.\n\nFor example, the\n\nU(1)B\u2212L \u00d7U(1)I3R \u00d7U(1)3B+L gauge symmetry may instead be broken by assigning VEVs\nto the right-handed neutrino fields NR . In this case, the gauge symmetry is broken to\nSU(3)C \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y \u00d7 U(1)B .\n\n(3.8)\n\nHowever, assigning VEVs to NR breaks SUSY, which is expected not to occur until the TeV\nscale. To avoid such outcomes, the U(1)I3R \u00d7U(1)B\u2212L \u00d7U(1)3B+L symmetry breaking is thus\nnaively expected to occur near the usual GUT scale. Indeed, as shown in [34], if the PS\ngauge symmetry is broken to the MSSM at the GUT/string scale, then the MSSM gauge\ncouplings are unified. Thus, it is natural to assume that the \u03a6, \u03a6 fields from the a2 c\u20322 sector\nobtain GUT-scale VEVs. That being said, the possibility of breaking the gauge symmetry\nat the TeV-scale by assigning VEVs to NR and not \u03a6, \u03a6 is worth exploring.\n\nIV.\n\nPHENOMENOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS ON SINGLET VEVS\n\nIn the previous section we demonstrated that the gauge symmetry may be broken to\nSU(3)C \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y \u00d7 U(1)L at the GUT scale by assigning VEVs to the vectorlike\nfields \u03a6, \u03a6, or to SU(3)C \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y \u00d7 U(1)B at the TeV scale by assigning VEVs\nto the right-handed neutrinos NR . These two cases show that models of this type may be\nadapted to provide either a U(1)L or U(1)B that survives unbroken to low energies.\nHowever, other singlet fields appear in the model whose VEVs may break U(1)3B+L [or\nequivalently, U(1)B and U(1)L ] at intermediate scales, namely, the singlets SL and SR , as\nwell as the SU(2)R triplet fields TR . In order to determine the scales at which these fields\nmay obtain VEVs, one must study other observable phenomena mediated by these fields.\nAs we shall see below, one can construct operators that allow proton decay, which imposes\nconstraints upon the VEVs of the SR fields. In addition, one can construct superpotential\n11\n\n\foperators for the Higgsino bilinear \u03bc term and for the Majorana mass term for right-handed\nneutrinos, which are in turn constrained.\n\nA.\n\nProton Decay via Exotic Fields\n\nAlthough the d = 4 and d = 5 operators involving only MSSM fields that could mediate\nproton decay are excluded by the gauged U(1)B\u2212L and U(1)3B+L gauge symmetries, the\nmodel also contains fields that are not part of the MSSM, yet are charged under U(1)B and/or\nU(1)L . Operators involving these extra fields can mediate B- or L-violation. Furthermore,\nB- and L-violation can occur below energy scales at which U(1)B\u2212L and U(1)3B+L are\nspontaneously broken [and, as discussed previously, if such operators are perturbatively\nforbidden by the global U(1) symmetries, then additional instanton suppression factors\nappear]. One must examine the possible operators that arise and their VEVs in order\nto fully address these issues.\nThe leading such operator involving exotic fields that mediates proton decay is\n\u03ba\nQQQLSR ,\n2\nMSt\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere MSt = O(1018 GeV) is the string scale. Even though it is a singlet under all gauge\ngroups, this operator is perturbatively forbidden by the global symmetries U(1)4,2L,2R and\ncan only be induced via nonperturbative effects such as from D-brane instantons, which\nintroduce the suppression factor \u03ba \u221d e\u2212SE2 . This operator is effectively d = 5, assuming\nthat the singlet fields SRi obtain VEVs:\ne\u2212SE2 hSRi i\nQQQL .\n2\nMSt\n\n(4.2)\n\nUsing the phenomenological bound (e.g., [7]) on the operator QQQL, we require\ne\u2212SE2 hSRi i\n\u2264 O(10\u22127) ,\nMSt\n\n(4.3)\n\nin order to satisfy the experimental lower limit on the proton lifetime. This estimate, of\ncourse, assumes the existence of a suitable D-brane instanton with the appropriate zero-mode\nstructure in the model, which is far from obvious. Assuming such an instanton exists in the\nworst-case scenario e\u2212SE2 \u2248 1, then the maximum allowed VEV is hSR i \u2248 1011 GeV; at the\nother extreme, an instanton suppression of 10\u22127 would allow hSRi i to be as large as MSt . A\n12\n\n\fthorough analysis, which we do not undertake here, would require enumerating operators\nthat, upon receiving VEVs, effectively assume the forms of the \"dangerous\" operators in\nEqs. (2.1)\u2013(2.3); however, the approach is completely analogous to that for Eq. (4.2).\nOf course, the most straightforward way to eliminate the possibility of rapid proton decay\nvia such operators involving exotic fields such is to forbid these fields from obtaining large\nVEVs. However, other phenomenological properties can depend on VEVs of these fields.\nAmong these, in particular, are the \u03bc term and the Majorana mass term for right-handed\nneutrinos, which we discuss next.\n\nB.\n\nThe \u03bc Term and Majorana Neutrino Masses\n\nThe problem of generating a \u03bc superpotential term of the form \u03bcHu Hd , with \u03bc = O(TeV),\nis well known in supersymmetric models. Specifically, the question of why the \u03bc parameter\nis TeV-scale rather than Planck-scale has long been an open question in the MSSM. In\nthe context of intersecting D-brane models, this problem is somewhat ameliorated in that\na simple bilinear coupling is forbidden by global U(1) symmetries [here, U(1)2L,2R ]. Such a\nterm can therefore only be generated either by high-order couplings or by nonperturbative\neffects such as D-brane instantons [43]. In either case, one expects the effective operator to\nbe suppressed by powers of MSt .\nOne possibility for generating a \u03bc term is through the higher-dimensional (d = 5) operator\nW \u2283\n\ny\u03bcijkl i j k l\nS S H H ,\nMSt L R u d\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhere y\u03bcijkl are Yukawa couplings. In this case, the singlets SR may obtain string or GUTscale VEVs (or lower, as described previously) while preserving the D-flatness of U(1)2R ,\nand the singlets SL may obtain TeV-scale VEVs while preserving the D-flatness of U(1)2L ,\nwhile the Higgses couple through their electroweak-scale VEVs. Simple order-of-magnitude\nestimates then show that a TeV-scale \u03bc term may be generated, with y\u03bcijkl = O(1).\nFor a \u03bc term of the desired magnitude to be generated by this higher-dimensional operator, the fields SR must obtain VEVs near MSt . However, as discussed in the previous\nsection, the constraint hSRi i \u226a MSt is expected from proton decay unless strong instanton\nsuppressions are present. Thus, while this class of models does provide a mechanism to\ngenerate \u03bc of natural size, it is somewhat preferable for SR to obtain VEVs at a scale much\n13\n\n\flower than MSt , and for the (bulk of the) \u03bc term to be generated via some other mechanism,\nsuch as D-brane instantons.\nFrom Table I and Eqs. (3.1), (3.2), and (3.3), one may check that SRi is a singlet under B \u2212\nL but is charged under 3B +L, and therefore hSRi i spontaneously breaks U(1)L (and similarly\nfor hTRi i). One then expects the scale at which SR and TR obtain VEVs to be correlated\nwith the scale at which the right-handed neutrinos obtain Majorana masses, an idea that\nis implemented as follows. A simple Majorana mass term for right-handed neutrinos of the\nform M*N c N c is perturbatively forbidden in the model by the global U(1) symmetries [here,\nU(1)4,2R ]. A Majorana mass can therefore only be generated by high-dimensional operators\nor by nonperturbative effects. Indeed, the possibility of generating a Majorana mass term\nvia D-brane instantons has been much studied in the literature [46, 47]. However, it should\nbe mentioned that for the models studied in [33, 34, 48, 49], a standard Majorana mass\nterm M *N c N c is not a singlet under U(1)B\u2212L [or, for that matter, U(1)3B+L ] and therefore\ncannot be generated solely via D-brane instantons. On the other hand, Majorana masses\ncan be generated in these models without instantons by high-dimensional operators such as\nmnkl\nyN\nij\nTRm TRn \u03a6i \u03a6j FRk FRl ,\nW \u2283\n3\nMSt\n\n(4.5)\n\nmnkl\nwhere yN\nij are Yukawa couplings, and the fields TR and \u03a6 may obtain VEVs at the string\n\nscale (or lower). For the model of Table I, right-handed neutrino masses can be generated\nmnkl\n(\u22127)\u2212(\u22123)\nin the range 1010\u221214 GeV for yN\n, assuming GUT- or string-scale VEVs for\nij \u223c 10\n\nthe \u03a6 and TR . As noted above, hTRi i also break U(1)3B+L and U(1)L , which suggests that\nlower values of hTRi i (comparable to or perhaps somewhat larger than those of hSRi i, say,\nmnkl\n1014 GeV) allow for yN\nij to be of a natural O(1) size.\n\nIn summary, if the \u03bc term and the Majorana mass term are generated by high-dimensional\noperators involving the fields SR and TR with string-scale VEVs, then U(1)3B+L is broken\nnear MSt . In this case, the only Abelian factor that survives at low energies is the weak\nhypercharge U(1)Y , and the suppression of proton decay and the Majorana mass scale require\nsmall coefficients, but the \u03bc term is of natural size. If hSRi i and hTRi i lie closer to the Majorana\nmass scale, then proton decay and Majorana mass terms can have natural coefficients, but\nthen the \u03bc term must be generated by effects other than high-dimensional operators, in\nparticular via D-brane instanton-induced operators. Thus, it is quite possible that the \u03bc\nterm and Majorana mass term may be generated without requiring string-scale VEVs for\n14\n\n\fthe fields SR and TR . If this is the case, then U(1)L can remain unbroken down to the\nelectroweak scale.\n\nC.\n\nBaryogenesis\n\nThe existence of B-violating processes is one of the three Sakharov conditions [50] that\nmust be satisfied in order for baryogenesis to be realized. As shown for this model, processes\nthat can mediate proton decay are strongly suppressed. Indeed, the relevant operators\nare forbidden by U(1)X and/or perturbatively forbidden by global U(1) symmetries. In\nfact, if global U(1)baryon must be conserved [i.e., if no nonperturbative U(1)baryon -violating\ninteraction can be generated] and the nonzero VEVs are the aforementioned h\u03a6a2c2\u2032 i, hSL i,\nhSR i, and hTR i [all of which are singlets under U(1)baryon ], B-violation is forbidden. This\nresult holds for both the single-operator and two-operator proton-decay combinations. The\nproton is effectively stable under these assumptions. On the other hand, since all of the\nVEVs listed above break global U(1)lepton , one can show that every L-violating, B-conserving\noperator out of the 36 can be produced with the four given VEVs without violating any\nsymmetry. Thus, L-violating processes clearly dominate over B-violating ones in this model.\nThe most likely possibility for realizing the matter-antimatter symmetry of the universe\nwithin this model is therefore electroweak baryogenesis [51, 52]. In this scenario, leptogenesis\noccurs first, thereby generating a lepton-number asymmetry. Nonperturbative field configurations known as sphalerons then convert this lepton-number asymmetry into a baryonnumber asymmetry, resulting in baryogenesis. Our model allows numerous L-violating operators at the perturbative level, while B-violation requires instanton-like configurations\nto occur; even if such configurations are heavily suppressed in the modern universe, they\nmay be much easier to realize in the high-temperature environment of the early universe.\nElectroweak baryogenesis is therefore touted as a natural means of generating a baryon\nasymmetry while also maintaining the effective stability of the proton.\nOne should recall that a sufficient amount of CP violation (CPV) is also a necessary\nSakharov condition for baryogenesis. While the minimal three-generation SM is well known\nto possess insufficient CPV to account for baryogenesis, the introduction of a fourth generation [53] provides a suitable natural source of CPV. Other CPV sources enter through\nthe MSSM two-Higgs potential, and indeed, through the couplings of numerous exotic fields\n15\n\n\fappearing in our string-inspired model. All of the basic ingredients necessary to realize the\nobserved baryogenesis therefore appear to be present in this model.\n\nV.\n\nPROSPECTS FOR NEW PHYSICS\n\nThe four-generation model (or more accurately, family of models) discussed here was\nconstructed in Type IIA string theory with D6-branes intersecting at angles. As such, the\nmodel satisfies all global consistency constraints as well as preserving N = 1 supersymmetry.\nIn addition, the model has a rich phenomenology, which includes rank-2 Yukawa matrices\nthat can provide a natural explanation for the mass textures required to satisfy current\nconstraints on a fourth generation of chiral fermions. Also, the MSSM gauge couplings\nare unified at the tree-level in the model, and matter charged under the hidden sector\ndecouples at high energies. These features by themselves make this string theory model of\nhigh phenomenological interest, and provide additional motivation for the possible existence\nof a fourth generation of quarks and leptons that might be observed at the LHC.\nGiven the above features, it is really quite remarkable that the model automatically possesses an extra nonanomalous U(1) gauge symmetry that forbids all of the dimension-4, -5,\nand -6 operators that mediate proton decay in the MSSM. Although the idea of eliminating\nthese operators using an extra nonanomalous U(1) is not new, the extra U(1) of this model\nis not added to the model by hand, but rather emerges automatically from the D-brane\nconstruction. Specifically, this extra U(1) has not been made anomaly-free by arbitrarily\nadding extra matter representations into the model as is done in most phenomenological\nmodels in the literature. Among the phenomenological consequences of the existence of this\nU(1) is that the proton is, for all intents and purposes, stable in the model. This result is\nconsistent with the non-observation of proton decay, and furthermore implies that proton\ndecay should not be observed in future experiments. This being said, as discussed in the\nprevious section, proton decay may be allowed in principle via operators involving exotic\nmatter fields. However, these operators are forbidden by global symmetries in the model,\nand it has not been demonstrated that they may be induced by nonperturbative effects such\nas D-brane instantons. Even if such effects occur, one then merely obtains constraints on\nthe VEVs of the exotic singlet fields in the model, as discussed above.\nAs the dimension-4 operators that mediate rapid proton decay are forbidden by the\n16\n\n\fAbelian gauge symmetries, the role for an R parity is much diminished in the model; R\nparity is not required to eliminate rapid proton decay in this model as it does in the MSSM.\nThis fact may have dramatic consequences for the supersymmetric phenomenology at the\nLHC and for dark matter experiments. In particular, the absence of R parity results in an\nunstable Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP). In the MSSM with R parity, the LSP is\nstable and thus must be electromagnetically neutral, which provides a natural candidate for\ndark matter. In addition, many of the collider signatures that provide the cleanest signals for\nthe production of supersymmetric particles are those with large missing transverse energy\n(MET). Such signals are expected to arise when the produced supersymmetric particles\ndecay directly to the LSP, which is typically a neutralino. However, if the LSP is no longer\nstable in the absence of R parity, then these MET signals do not have the same significance.\nIndeed, in this scenario the LSP is not even required to be electromagnetically neutral. The\nlack of R parity makes the observation of supersymmetric particles at the LHC a much\nmore difficult proposition. In addition, the LSP cannot be stable dark matter, which would\nstrongly impact the prospects for direct dark matter detection experiments.\nFinally, as we have seen, it is possible for the gauge symmetry to be broken to the\nMSSM with an extra gauged U(1) that couples either to lepton [U(1)L ] or to baryon [U(1)B ]\nnumber. Whether one obtains a gauged lepton number or a gauged baryon number at\nlow energies depends intrinsically upon which fields are used to break the gauge symmetry.\nEither U(1)L or U(1)B may survive unbroken to the TeV scale or below. If so, the symmetry\nwould be heralded by so-called leptophilic or leptophobic Z \u2032 bosons, respectively, which\nwould be observable at the LHC. As mentioned above, a leptophilic Z \u2032 could explain [12]\nthe observed PAMELA [13]/ATIC [14]/Fermi LAT [15] cosmic ray positron excess, while\na leptophobic Z \u2032 has been discussed in connection with recent anomalies observed by the\nCDF collaboration [16\u201318]. Such considerations deserve detailed study, which we leave for\nfuture work.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have demonstrated the existence of an extra massless and anomaly-free U(1) gauge\nsymmetry in the model constructed in [34] that plays a central role in suppressing B- and\nL-violation. In particular, we obtained linear combinations of this U(1)X with U(1)B\u2212L that\n17\n\n\fcount baryon and lepton number, respectively, thereby providing U(1)B,L gauge symmetries\nat the string scale that forbid all dimension-4, dimension-5, and dimension-6 operators\ninvolving only MSSM fields that mediate proton decay.\nNevertheless, additional fields charged under the gauged B and L symmetries appear\nin the model; other operators involving this exotic matter arise that can mediate proton\ndecay through their VEVs, once U(1)X breaks spontaneously. We found the leading such\noperator QQQLSR , and while noting that it can only appear nonperturbatively in the model,\nestimated the constraint on the operator's coefficient. Constrained, in turn, is the scale at\nwhich the singlet fields SR may receive VEVs. We noted that VEVs for SR break U(1)L ;\nif hSR i is low, as suggested by the proton decay constraint, then U(1)L can potentially\nremain unbroken down to the electroweak scale. If so, this scenario can provide a so-called\nleptophilic Z \u2032 boson, which could be observed at the LHC and which can explain the galactic\ncosmic ray positron excess observed by the PAMELA collaboration.\nThe appearance of this extra massless and anomaly-free gauge symmetry U(1)X in the\nmodel is quite remarkable. This extra U(1) occurs naturally alongside the usual MSSM\ngauge symmetry, and is therefore arguably a natural extension of the MSSM. The fact that\nU(1)X forbids all of the well-known dimension-4 and -5 operators that can mediate rapid\nproton decay, while also allowing all of the Yukawa couplings for quarks and leptons, is\nespecially remarkable. As we have seen, this extra Abelian gauge symmetry can be viewed\nas a means of gauging baryon and lepton number, which is strongly compatible with the\nnon-observation of B- and L-violating effects such as proton decay and neutrinoless double\nbeta decay. These features, combined with previous results shown for this particular model\nthat the MSSM gauge couplings unify at the string scale and that it is possible to naturally\nobtain realistic Yukawa mass matrices for quarks and leptons, give this model particular\nphenomenological value.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant No.\nPHY-0757394.
