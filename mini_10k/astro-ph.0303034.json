Introduction\nIn most current dynamo models (see e.g. Petrovay, 2000, for a review), the strong toroidal magnetic field responsible for solar activity\nis generated in the thin rotational shear layer below the convective\nzone (CZ), known as the tachocline. To hold sufficient magnetic flux\nto explain the flux observed at the surface without unrealistically high\nfield strengths, this layer should be at least a few megameters thick. On\nthe other hand, a magnetic field oscillating with a circular frequency\n\u03c9cyc = 2\u03c0/P , (P = 22 years is the solar cycle period) is known to\npenetrate a conductive medium only down to a skin depth of\nHskin = (2\u03b7/\u03c9cyc )1/2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b7 is the magnetic diffusivity. If Hskin > 1 Mm then we conclude\nfrom this that for present-day dynamo models to work, we must have\nc 2003 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

For comparison, the molecular\nmagnetic diffusivity is \u223c 103 cm2 /s in this part of the Sun, while the\nturbulent diffusivity in the convective zone is estimated to be 1012 \u2013\n1013 cm2 /s.\nHelioseismic evidence indicates that at low heliographic latitudes\nthe middle of the tachocline is situated at 0.69 R\u2299 (1 R\u2299 = 698 Mm\nis the solar radius) and its thickness is less than a few percent of R\u2299\n(Kosovichev, 1996). There are indications that at high latitudes the\ntachocline is situated at slightly shallower depths, r = 0.705R\u2299 , and it\nmay also be marginally thicker (Basu and Antia, 2001). Comparing this\nwith the radius of the bottom of the adiabatically stratified convective\nzone, 0.71 R\u2299 , it is clear that most of the tachocline lies in the radiative\ninterior, especially near the equator, so the relatively high value of the\n(presumably turbulent) magnetic diffusivity inferred above is puzzling.\nHence, there is clearly a need to understand the nature of small-scale\nturbulent motions in the tachocline. Unfortunately, while the thermal\nstratification in the tachocline is relatively well known, its fluid dynamical properties, including the precise profile of the rotational flow\nv(r, \u03b8), the meridional flow, and the characteristics of turbulence, are\nvery poorly constrained by observations.\nThe tachocline is thus basically an MHD shear flow in the azimuthal direction in a thin, rotating spherical shell with both radial\nand latitudinal shear and a strongly stable stratification (Richardson\nnumber \u223c 103 ). Theoretical understanding and experimental knowledge regarding turbulence in stratified shear flows has been reviewed\nby Hopfinger (1987) and Thorpe (1987). These reviews ephasize the\ntendency towards two-dimensional, predominantly horizontal motions\nin such situations, the vertical motions being limited to the small\nbuoyancy scale (see below). In line with the concepts outlined in those\nreviews, the present paper to relies on theoretical arguments concerning\nthe properties of turbulent motions in such conditions. On the basis\nof such arguments, simplified one- or two-dimensional models may be\nconstructed for the mean flow, or appropriate subgrid closure schemes\nmay be constructed for full 3D large-eddy simulations. While such arguments have been attempted in the past (Spiegel and Zahn, 1992, Gough\nand McIntyre, 1998), in the lack of detailed turbulence calculations to\nbe used for subgrid closures, all tachocline models published to date\nhave either simply ignored turbulence (R\u00fcdiger and Kitchatinov, 1997,\nMacGregor and Charbonneau, 1999, Garaud, 2001a, Cally, 2001), or\nassumed arbitrary fixed scalar turbulent diffusivities in 2D mean flow\nmodels (Forg\u00e1cs-Dajka and Petrovay, 2001, 2002, Forg\u00e1cs-Dajka, 2003)\nand in 3D LES (Miesch, 2001, 2002).\n\nctrp.tex; 4/12/2018; 6:32; p.2\n\n\f3\n\nA Model for the Turbulent Tachocline\n\nThe aim of the present work is to attempt to remedy this situation\nby considering, on the basis of the known stability criteria, the possible\nsources of turbulence in a strongly stably stratified shear flow with both\nvertical and horizontal shear, and discussing the expected properties of\nthe turbulence generated by it, on the basis of a dimensional analysis\nof the K\u2013\u01eb equations. As our analysis does not consider the effects of\nspherical geometry, rotation, meridional circulation, non-adiabatic convective overshoot, or magnetic instabilities, it should only be regarded\nas a fist step towards a more comprehensive theoretical analysis of\nthe problem of turbulence in the solar tachocline. These theoretical\narguments can be found in Section 2. Then, in Section 3, as an illustration of the use of such theoretical considerations, our prescription for\ncalculating the turbulent diffusivity in the tachocline, equation (9), is\nincorporated in a simplified one-dimensional model for the tachocline.\nThe results show that Maxwell stresses due to an oscillatory poloidal\nmagnetic field of a few hundred gauss (a rather moderate value) are able\nto confine the tachocline to a thickness below 5 megameters. The conditions of validity of our treatment are discussed in Section 4. Finally,\nSection 5 concludes the paper by comparing our suggested picture of\ntachocline turbulence with numerical simulation results and discussing\nthe implications of the results.\n\n2. A possible source of turbulence: the secondary shear\ninstability\nThe thermal stratification of the Sun is quite accurately known from\na comparison of standard solar models with helioseismic inversion results. The radiative interior below the CZ is characterized by significant\nnegative values of \u2206\u2207. For rough estimates, a useful approximation in\nthe tachocline region (i.e. near the top of the radiative zone) is \u2206\u2207 \u223c\n\u22120.015 z[Mm], where z = rbcz \u2212 r is the depth below the bottom of the\nconvective zone, at a radius value of rbcz = 0.71R\u2299 . On the other hand,\nthe pressure scale height in this region is HP = \u2212P dz/dP \u223c 50 Mm.\nWith g = 5 * 104 cm2 /s, this yields a Brunt-V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency\n2\nNBV\n[s\u22122 ] = \u2212\u2206\u2207g/HP \u223c 1.5 * 10\u22127 z [Mm],\n\n(2)\n\ni.e. at a depth of a few megameters NBV \u223c 10\u22123 s\u22121 .\nA displaced mass element will then oscillate around its equilibrium\n\u22121\nposition under the action of buoyancy on a timescale NBV\n\u223c 103 s. The\namplitude of the oscillation is clearly \u223c vz /NBV , so in the presence\nof turbulent motions, these motions will be limited to a vertical scale\nlb = K 1/2 /NBV , called the buoyancy scale. (K = vz2 is the kinetic\n\nctrp.tex; 4/12/2018; 6:32; p.3\n\n\f4\n\nK. Petrovay\n\nenergy in the vertical component of motions.) On the other hand,\nas an elementary estimate gives \u03bd \u223c K 2 /\u01eb for the vertical turbulent\ndiffusivity, one has lb \u223c (\u03bd/NBV )1/2 . Vertical overturning motions on\nscales exceeding lb will be strongly damped by gravity wave emission.\nThe pole-equator difference in the rotational rate of the convective\nzone is about 30 % of the equatorial rotation rate. Taking half of this\nvalue to be the characteristic amplitude of the differential rotation (cf.\neq. (5) below), we have a differential rotation amplitude \u2206v0 \u223c 3 *\n104 cm/s at the top of the tachocline. This value is clearly also roughly\nthe amplitude of the vertical velocity difference across the tachocline,\nso the characteristic vertical shear is\nS \u223c \u2206v0 /H \u223c 3 * 10\u22125 s\u22121\n\n(3)\n\nwhere H is the scale height of \u2206v, as given by equation (5) below.\nHelioseismic calibrations (Basu and Antia, 2001) indicate H \u223c 10 Mm.\n2 /S 2 \u223c 103 . This enormous\nThis yields a Richardson number Ri = NBV\nvalue shows that the vertical shear cannot directly drive turbulence in\nthe tachocline.\nBuoyancy, however, cannot stabilize the horizontal shear. While\nlinear stability analysis (Dziembowski and Kosovichev, 1987, Charbonneau, Dikpati, and Gilman, 1999) shows that the horizontal shear\nis close to marginal stability in the 2D nonmagnetic case, nonlinear,\n3D effects and magnetic fields are known to lead to strong instability\n(Gilman and Dikpati, 2000, Dikpati and Gilman, 2001). The motions\ndriven by the horizontal shear instability are predominantly horizontal,\nand their spatial scale is\nlh \u223c R\u2299 ,\n(4)\nOn the basis of general experience with shear flow turbulence1 , the velocity scale vh of the horizontal motions driven by the shear instability\nmay be assumed to be close to the amplitude \u2206v of the horizontal shear\nat the given depth:\nvh \u223c \u2206v = [\u03c9(z, \u03b8 = 0) \u2212 \u03c9(z, \u03b8 = \u03c0/2)]R\u2299 /2\n\n(5)\n\nSimilarly, their correlation time is assumed to be\nlh /vh \u223c R\u2299 /\u2206v\n\n(6)\n\nOverturning turbulent motions in the vertical direction are impeded\nby the stable stratification, their scale being limited to lb . Owing to the\n1\n\nIn fact it is not obvious that this experience is a useful guide under conditions\nin the solar tachocline.

The\nintensity of turbulence will then keep increasing until the turbulent\ndiffusivity reaches the critical value \u03bdcr , when further shear production\nis switched off.\nWe thus conclude that the secondary vertical shear instability can\nbe expected to drive overturning turbulence to the level \u03bd = \u03bdcr on a\nshort timescale. The turbulence generated by this mechanism may then\nbe crudely represented by the vertical diffusivity value given by eq. (9).\nD\u01eb = CD1\n\n3. Tachocline model\n3.1. Model equations\nWe now proceed to develop a simple one-dimensional model for the solar tachocline, assuming that the secondary shear instability discussed\nin the previous section is the only source of turbulence in the tachocline\nregion. Our computational domain will be restricted to the top of the\nradiative interior, below rbcz .\nThe convective zone is characterized by extremely high turbulent\ndiffusivities. Due to the Coriolis force, the Reynolds stress tensor also\nhas significant nondiagonal components in the convective envelope.\nThese components imply an angular momentum transport which is\nthought to be the main driver of solar differential rotation. Based on\nthe discussion of the previous section we expect that the amplitude\n\nctrp.tex; 4/12/2018; 6:32; p.6\n\n\f7\n\nA Model for the Turbulent Tachocline\n\nof turbulence in the tachocline is much lower than in the CZ. Thus,\nfrom the point of view of tachocline modelling, it is not unrealistic\nto regard the latitudinal differential rotation at r = rbcz as a given\nboundary condition imposed at the top of the region of interest. This\nis tantamount to assuming that differential rotation is driven by a\nhighly effective mechanism in the convective zone which is not seriously\ninfluenced by the processes in the tachocline.\nAs the layer studied is thin, we also adopt a plane parallel representation for it, with constant density. (The effects of the stable\ndensity stratification are only implicitly taken into account by its role\nin determining the turbulent viscosity, eq. (9).)\nThus, we regard the following model problem. Consider a plane\nparallel layer of incompressible fluid of density \u03c1, where the viscosity \u03bd\nand the magnetic diffusivity \u03b7 depend on z only. At z = 0 where z is\nthe vertical coordinate (corresponding to depth in the solar application\nwe have in mind) a periodic horizontal shearing flow is imposed in the\ny direction:\nvy0 = v0 cos(kx)\n(so that x will correspond to heliographic latitude, while y to the\nlongitude). We assume a two-dimensional flow pattern (\u2202/\u2202y = 0)\nand vx = vz = 0 (no \"meridional flow\"). An oscillatory horizontal\n\"poloidal\" field is is present in the x direction, given by\nVp =\n\n\u2202A\n1\n1/2\n\u2202z\n(4\u03c0\u03c1)\n\n(18)\n\n(in Alfv\u00e9nic units). The \"toroidal\" (i.e. y) component A of the vector\npotential obeys the corresponding component of the integral of the\ninduction equation, which in our case simplifies to a diffusion equation:\n\u2202\n\u2202A\n\u2202A\n=\n\u03b7\n\u2202t\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(19)\n\nThe upper boundary condition is A = A0 cos(\u03c9t) at z = 0, where A0\nfixes the poloidal field amplitude.\nThe evolution of the azimuthal components of the velocity and the\nmagnetic field is described by the corresponding components of the\nequations of motion and induction, respectively.

Indeed, solving our\nequations for the case of constant diffusivities \u03bd and \u03b7, the results are\nin a remarkably good agreement with the full 2D solutions in spherical\ngeometry, presented in Forg\u00e1cs-Dajka and Petrovay (2002).\nThe equations were solved numerically by a finite difference scheme\nsecond-order accurate in time. All quantities were set to zero at the\nlower boundary, situated at z0 = 60 or 30 Mm below rbcz , while the\nboundary conditions applied at top (z = 0) were v = v0 = 3 * 104 cm/s\nand different prescribed values for A0 . As equation (9) is singular at\nz = 0, \u03bd was set to a high finite value \u03bdmax here.

Test runs with varying values of \u03bdmax and \u03bdm ,\nhowever, show that these choices do not significantly distort the results.\n\nctrp.tex; 4/12/2018; 6:32; p.10\n\n\fA Model for the Turbulent Tachocline\n\n11\n\nStarting from an arbitrary intial state, the system was allowed to\nevolve until very nearly periodic behaviour sets in (in about 104 years,\ndepending on the value of \u03bdm ), then average quatities for one 11-year\nhalf-cycle were computed and plotted as functions of depth (Figs. 1\nand 2).\n3.2. Results\nIn the case with a very weak magnetic field (left-hand column in Fig. 1),\nit is straightforward to show that equation (25) with \u03bd given by (9)\nadmits the analytic solution\n\"\n\nv = v0 1 \u2212\n\n\u0012\n\nz\nz0\n\n\u00132 #1/4\n\n,\n\n(26)\n\nconfirmed by the numerical calculations. This essentially means that\nin this case the shear penetrates as far down into the radiative interior\nas the placement of the lower boundary condition allows. The weak\nmagnetic field itself only penetrates down to the skin depth given by\nequation (1), as expected. It is worth noting that the poloidal field\namplitude shows a non-monotonic behaviour with depth in all cases,\nreaching its maximum at some finite z value. This is due to the variable diffusivity: the horizontal field lines tend to \"pile up\" where the\ndiffusivity is significantly reduced.\nFrom the right-hand column of Fig. 2 we can see that a poloidal\nmagnetic field of a few hundred gauss (peak strength 500 G) can confine\nthe tachocline to a thickness of barely 5 Mm.\nOne might think that an intermediate field strength might lead to a\nsomewhat thicker tachocline. This is, however, not the case: an inspection of the full series of results in our figures clearly shows that a weaker\nfield simply results in an \"aborted tachocline\", i.e. the horizontal shear\nis first reduced by a factor depending on the field strength in a thin\nlayer of a few Mm, but below that layer, as the magnetic field is damped\nby the skin effect, it follows the field-free solution (26), with a lower\namplitude.\n\n4. Discussion: conditions of validity\n\nctrp.tex; 4/12/2018; 6:32; p.11\n\n\f12\n\nK. Petrovay\n\n4.1. Scales of the horizontal motions\nOne important assumption in our model was that the velocity and time\nscales of horizontal motions due to the shear instability are given by\nequations (5) and (6). This is indeed the general experience with unstable shear flows, its physical background being an equilibrium between\ngrowth and turbulent dissipation of the dominant modes. The growth\ntimescale is\n\u03c4g \u223c lh /\u2206v\n(27)\nwhile the dissipation timescale is\n\u03c4d \u223c lh2 /\u03bdh\n\n(28)\n\nEquating these timescales and substituting \u03bdh \u223c lh vh for the turbulent\ndiffusivity, we indeed find vh \u223c \u2206v.\nBut this line of argument is na\u0131\u0308ve for several reasons. First, in the\nstrongly stratified, quasi-2D flow in the tachocline the main mechanism of dissipation is not the nonlinear transfer between 2D modes but\nthe viscous dissipation (due to overturning small-scale 3D turbulence)\nbetween neighbouring slabs. Thus, the dissipation timescale is rather\n\u03c4d \u223c lc2 /\u03bd.\n\n(29)\n\nNevertheless, substituting here the formula (7), derived assuming the\nvalidity of equations (5) and (6), the result is again vh \u223c \u2206v, confirming\nthat our assumption was consistent.\nSecondly, equation (27) may not be a valid expression of the growth\ntimescale if the instability is only slightly supercritical. Linear 2D hydrodynamical stability analysis indeed shows that the horizontal shear\nin the tachocline is close to marginal stability (Dziembowski and Kosovichev, 1987, Charbonneau, Dikpati, and Gilman, 1999). The weakly\nnonlinear extension of the analysis (Garaud, 2001b) indicates that the\nevolution of unstable modes is such that they modify the mean shear\nprofile towards increasing stability, thus ensuring marginal stability,\nlow growth rates and low velocity amplitudes. As, however, 3D effects\nand magnetic fields are known to lead to strong instability with much\nweaker shear (Gilman and Dikpati, 2000, Dikpati and Gilman, 2001),\none may expect that this near-criticality is a feature limited to 2D HD\nmodels only.\nSomewhat surprisingly, the 3D thin shell simulations of Miesch (2002)\nalso show rather low nonaxisymmetric horizontal flow amplitudes, at\nleast one order of magnitude below the shear amplitude. This is so\ndespite the strongly supercritical rotation profile chosen, which is not\nsignificantly altered by the feedback of the nonaxisymmetric flow. One\n\nctrp.tex; 4/12/2018; 6:32; p.12\n\n\fA Model for the Turbulent Tachocline\n\n13\n\nmay speculate that this is the result of the rather high numerical\nviscosities applied.\nFurther study of the flows driven by the horizontal shear instability\nis clearly important. In addition to clarifying the issue of characteristic\nscales of this flow, such studies may shed more light on the question\nof the importance and sense of any direct angular momentum transport by these motions. At any rate, a lower velocity amplitude or a\nlonger timescale for the horizontal flows would result in lower critical\nfield strengths for the secondary shear instability, resulting in an even\nthinner tachocline confined by even weaker fields in the framework of\nthe present model.\n4.2. Other sources of turbulence\nAnother important constraint in the present model was the assumption\nthat the secondary shear instability is the only source of turbulence\nin the tachocline. While a number of other instabilities in rotating\nradiative stellar interiors are known (cf. Tassoul, 1978, Zahn, 1983,\nSpruit, 1999), they are mostly acting throughout the radiative interior\nwhere constraints such as chemical mixing in stellar models impose\nrather strict limits on turbulence. Thus, in the tachocline we need\n\"extra\" sources of turbulence, for which shear instabilities are the most\nplausible candidate.\nMore important than rotational instabilities is the possibility of\nnonadiabatic overshooting convection. The recent solution of the Reynolds moment equations for the overshoot layer by Marik and Petrovay\n(2003) indicates that the total extent of nonadiabatic overshoot is negligible. On the other hand, Xiong and Deng (2001) find a very significant\nnonadiabatic overshoot. As both models have their own shortcomings,\nthgis issue is not quite settled yet. At any rate, if there is a significant\nnonadiabatic overshoot, the secondary shear instability would only set\nin below the overshoot layer, where the turbulent diffusivity is reduced\nbelow the critical value; in this layer, our model could still be considered\nvalid. Thus, the main effect of any nonadiabatic overshoot would be\nto \"shift\" the resulting tachocline to somewhat lower depths (unless\na stronger dynamo field reduces the horizontal shear already in the\novershoot region).\n\n5. Conclusion\nThis paper presented the first consistent model for the turbulent tachocline, with the turbulent diffusivity computed within the model instead\n\nctrp.tex; 4/12/2018; 6:32; p.13\n\n\f14\n\nK. Petrovay\n\nof being specified arbitrarily. For the origin of the 3D turbulence a new\nmechanism was proposed, the secondary vertical shear instability of 2D\nmotions taking place in thin horizontal slabs.\nIndependent evidence for the mechanism proposed here is hard to\nfind, as the conditions in the tachocline are extreme by terrestrial standards, and direct numerical simulations of stratified shear flows are\ncurrently limited to much lower values of the Richardson and Reynolds\nnumbers. Nevertheless, the presence of a quasi-2D, layered structure,\nand a strongly anisotropical turbulent diffusivity tensor have been confirmed in numerical simulations by M\u00e9tais and Herring (1989), Kaltenbach, Gerz, and Schumann (1994) and Jacobitz and Sarkar (1998).\nIndications for the presence of a secondary shear instability were also\nfound in the recent simulations of Werne and Fritts (1999).\nA formula for the diffusivity due to the turbulence generated by the\nsecondary shear, equation (9) was derived and applied in a simple 1D\nmodel of the tachocline, taking into account the Maxwell stresses due to\nthe dynamo field. As our analysis does not consider the effects of spherical geometry, rotation, non-adiabatic convective overshoot, meridional\ncirculation, or the effect of magnetic fields on stability, it should only\nbe regarded as a first step towards a more comprehensive theoretical\nanalysis of the problem of turbulence in the solar tachocline.\nA thin tachocline in our models can only be produced if the oscillatory dynamo magnetic field exceeds a critical limit. At this limit,\nthe thickness of the tachocline is \u223c 5 Mm and the mean value of the\nfield strength in the tachocline is 200 G. The total magnetic flux in the\ntachocline in this case agrees well with the total poloidal flux crossing\nthe equatorial plane in the poloidal flux transport model of Petrovay\nand Szak\u00e1ly (1999).\nOn the other hand, the tachocline resulting from our model is uncomfortably thin when compared to helioseismic constraints. Existing\nseismic calibrations of tachocline thickness (Basu and Antia, 2001) indicate a significantly thicker shear layer. These calibrations are based\non the use of simple predefined fitting profiles, characterized by a single\nlength scale. In contrast, our model indicates that for slightly subcritical\nmagnetic field strengths the profile is more complicated, the fast linear\ncutoff in v within the skin layer being replaced by a shallow but deep\nprofile of type (26) below. It remains to be seen, whether such a twotiered v-profile can yield an equal or better fit to helioseismic data than\nthe more conventional profiles.\nThe thin tachocline resulting from the present model is also hard\nto reconcile with the gradual depletion of lithium in the atmospheres\nof Sun-like stars during their lifetimes. Lithium is destroyed by nuclear\nreactions in layers below z \u223c 40 Mm only, so a mixing characterized\n\nctrp.tex; 4/12/2018; 6:32; p.14\n\n\fA Model for the Turbulent Tachocline\n\n15\n\nby a diffusivity of at least 103 cm2 /s must be present as far down as\nthat depth. While our prescription \u03bdm = 107 cm2 /s does not allow\na firm statement on this issue, the very sharp cutoff of the \u03bd-curve\nin the right-hand column of Fig. 2 does not seem to indicate that any\nsignificant level of turbulence could be maintained at such great depths.\nThe two-tiered character of our profiles might admit some \"leakage\" of\nturbulence into much deeper layers, but this would imply some rather\nimplausible fine-tuning of the dynamo field strength.\nOne obvious shortcoming of the present models is their simplified\ntreatment of the time development and of the geometry. The development of more realistic, axially symmetric spherical models employing\nthe viscosity formula (9) is in progress.\n\nAcknowledgements\nI am grateful for the hospitality of the Center for Turbulence Research\nat NASA Ames Research Center during part of this work.
