Advanced\nby the rapid developments in crystallographic growth techniques, a variety of low-symmetric crystalline surfaces have\nbeen subject to MOKE measurements in the last decades.\nThis has led to systematic investigations of magneto-optical\nanisotropy effects1 .\nState of the art theoretical approaches to investigate\nthe MOKE are based on first-principle calculations of dielectric tensors in the framework of the Kubo-Greenwood\nformalism2,3 as suggested by Wang and Callaway4 . The\nMOKE is obtained from a dielectric tensor by means of an\napproximative analytic expression\n\u03c8 + i\u03c7 =\n\n\u03b5xy\n\u221a .\n(1 \u2212 \u03b5xx ) \u03b5xx\n\nfor polycrystals it sensitively depends on the ordering of crystallographic domains. We calculate the MOKE of hcp h112\u03040i\nCo and of h010i CrO2 . For Co we show that the previous interpretation of experimental data of anisotropic polar MOKE1\nin terms of a manifestation of magneto-crystalline anisotropy\nremains valid.\nThe paper is organised as follows. In the subsequent section\nwe describe our approach to the complete calculation of the\nelectrodynamics problem by means of transfer matrix methods. Theoretical description of ellipsometry measurements\nfor single- and polycrystals is given in Sec. III. In Sec. IV\nwe discuss first-principle calculations of optical conductivities. Space-time symmetry of Co and CrO2 crystals is described in Sec. V. The calculated optical response of Co and\nCrO2 is presented in Sec. VI and Sec. VII respectively. In\nSec. VIII a summary and conclusions are given.\n\n(1)\n\nderived originally by Argyres in 19555. \u03c8 denotes the Kerr\nrotation and \u03c7 denotes the Kerr ellipticity.\nThis approach requires in general that the dielectric tensor\nhas symmetry\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u03b5xx \u03b5xy 0\n(2)\n\u03b5 = \uf8ed\u2212\u03b5xy \u03b5xx 0 \uf8f8 .\n0\n0 \u03b5zz\n\nThere have been theoretical attempts to extend the approach\nto low-symmetric systems, however so far the complete electrodynamics calculation for low symmetric dielectric tensors\nhas not been considered.\nThere are many interesting ferromagnets that have a low\nsymmetry, e.g. CrO2 , hcp h112\u03040i Co and FePt grown in the\nh010i direction. All of these systems have two different crystallographic axis in the surface plane, so beside their magnetooptical activity they exhibit crystallographic birefringence.\nIn this paper we show that for such crystals it is important\nto consider the complete optical response including birefringence and magnetic effect in order to describe correctly the\npolar MOKE. Further, we show that the optical response is\nqualitatively different for single- and polycrystals and finally,\n\nII.\n\nTRANSFER MATRIX METHODS\n\nThe optical response of a finite system of layers to an\nincident plane wave can be described by transfer matrix\nmethods6,7,8 . The description is valid if the magnetic permeability is unity and the wavelength of the light is large compared to the microscopic structure of materials and also large\ncompared to interface roughness. In the most general case a\nsystem with n boundaries is described by a regular set of 4n\nlinear equations that determines the complex amplitude vectors of all plane waves in all media. We briefly describe the\nmethod.\nWe first choose a coordinate system such that the z-axis is\nthe surface normal and the scattering plane is spanned by the\nz-axis and the y-axis. In the half space of the incident and\nreflected wave Fresnel's secular equation reads\n\u2212kk2E +\n\n\u03c92\nE = 0.\n\u03b5E\nc2\n\n(3)\n\nWe substitute r 7\u2192 \u03c9c r and define q := \u03c9c ky and k := \u03c9c kz .

It is described\nin detail in Ref. 11.\n\n(14)\n\nIII. ELLIPSOMETRY FOR SINGLE- AND\nPOLYCRYSTALS\n\nThe state of polarization of a plane wave is conveniently\ndescribed by Stokes parameters6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb \uf8f6 \uf8eb\nEx E x + E y Ey\nS0\n\uf8ec S \uf8f7 \uf8ec Ex E x \u2212 E y Ey \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\nS = \uf8ed 1\uf8f8 = \uf8ec\n(15)\n\uf8ed Ex E y + E x Ey \uf8f8 ,\nS2\nS3\ni(Ex E y \u2212 E x Ey )\n\nwhere E = (Ex , Ey ) is the complex amplitude vector of the\nplane wave in the coordinate system of the polarization state\n\n\f3\nanalysis.\nThe state of polarization of a set of incoherent plane waves\nthat add by their intensities is described by the sum of their\nStokes parameters. Both for a single wave and for an incoherent wave, the rotation angle of the polarization ellipse \u03c8 and\nits ellipticity \u03c7 are related to the Stokes parameters by\ntan 2\u03c8 =\n\nS2\nS1\n\nS3\n\nsin 2\u03c7 = q\n.\nS12 + S22 + S32\n\n(17)\n\nIn the general case the polarization ellipse is the intensity behind an analyser for all positions. Only in the special case of\na single wave is this equivalent to the curve that is drawn by\nthe tip of the electric field vector.\nThe optical response of a polycrystal can be described by\nthe sum over Stokes parameters of single crystalline domains\nweighted by surface areas of the domains and intensities shining on them12. The sum extends over all domains that are\nilluminated in the experiment. The approach is valid if single\ncrystalline domains are large compared to the wavelength. We\ncan calculate Stokes parameters for polycrystals by summing\nover Stokes parameters obtained from transfer matrix calculations for single crystals.\nFIRST-PRINCIPLE CALCULATIONS OF OPTICAL\nCONDUCTIVITIES\n\nWe briefly describe the calculation of optical constants by\nmeans of first-principle calculations. Our approach is basi-\n\nie2\n\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03c9) = 2 d 3 k\nm h\u0304\nZ\n\nBZ\n\n\u2211\n\n1\n(En (kk ) \u2212 El (kk )) .\nh\u0304\n\n(18)\n\nIn general, intra-band, as well as direct and indirect interband transitions, contribute to the optical conductivity. Spins\nmay flip (for magnetic dipole transitions) or stay constant (for\nelectric dipole transitions ) during excitations. It is a common practice to account only for the contribution of electric\ndipole (non-spin-flip) direct inter-band transitions by means\nof ab initio methods while treating the contribution of intraband transitions by a phenomenological Drude term\n\u03c3D (\u03c9) =\n\n\u03c30\n,\n1 + \u03c92\u03c42\n\n(19)\n\nand neglecting all other contributions4,14,15,16 . A broad variety of linear optical and magneto-optical effects in metals as\nwell as in semiconductors have been successfully described in\nthe framework of this approximation, see e.g. Refs. 17,18 and\nreferences therein. In the transition metals, intra-band transitions turn out to be important in the range from 0 eV up to 0.5\neV19 . It is shown in Ref. 4 that a corresponding Drude contribution is negligible for energies larger than 1 eV in the case of\nNi.

So we have to conclude within the error of our calculation \u03c3yy and \u03c3zz are equal.\nThe conclusion is that second order magnetic contribution can\nnot be resolved with standard electronic structure calculation.\n\nA. Optical conductivity\n\nWe have calculated the optical conductivity tensor of hcp\nh112\u03040i Co. A hybridised 4s4p3d and 5s5p4d basis was used\nin the calculations to describe the Co atoms. Exchange correlation was taken into account in the framework of the local\nspin density approximation in the form proposed in Ref. 25.\nThe lattice constants were a = 2.5071 \u00c5 and c = 4.0695 \u00c5.\n38400 k-points were used to sample the Brillouin zone. Results are shown in Fig. 2. They are in good agreement with\nprevious theoretical results23,24 . In the output of the calculation we find that tensor elements that should be zero due to\nsymmetry are of the order of 109 s\u22121 while we find a difference between \u03c3yy and \u03c3zz of the order of 1013 ..1012 s\u22121 . Thus\nthe symmetry of our calculated tensor is in agreement with\nEq. (26) and Eq. (30). We conclude that the calculated difference between \u03c3yy and \u03c3zz is a signature of second order\nmagnetic contribution. However if we change numerical pa-\n\nB. Optical response of the single crystal\n\nWe have calculated the optical response in polar MOKE\ngeometry with perpendicular incident light with our transfer\nmatrix approach. We find that the optical response depends\nstrongly on the direction of the polarization vector in the surface plane. If the polarization vector is along one of the main\ncrystal axis, birefringence is absent and the optical response is\nsimilar to common polar MOKE. When the polarization vector is turned away from the main crystal axis the optical response is a combination of crystallographic birefringence and\na magnetic effect. We find that birefringence starts to be important at about 3\u25e6 . Results are shown in Fig. 3. Directions\nof the polarization vector are in one quarter of the full circle\nin the surface plane which is choosen symmetrically around\nthe crystallographic x-axis.

The polarization vector is parallel to the crystallographic\nx-axis at zero angle. Curves shifted to higher values just below 5 eV\ncorrespond to positive angles.\n\nvector chosen around the crystallographic y-axis, results are\nidentical on the scale of the plot. The latter is a non-trivial\nresult. Since the crystallographic x- and y-directions are different one would expect independent results in half of the full\ncircle. It can only be understood by stressing that the birefringence is large compared to the magnetic effect (see below and\nSec. VI D). The solid curves show the case when the polarization vector is parallel to a main crystal axis. The optical\nresponse is similar to the polar MOKE of hcp h0001i Co23,24 .\nTo a good approximation it can be regarded as a common polar MOKE response without birefringence. The dashed and\ndotted curves show the optical response for cases when birefringence is important. If the polarization vector has an angle\nof \u00b15.5\u25e6 relative to the main crystal axis the birefringent contribution has about the same magnitude as the magnetic effect.\nIt reaches its maximum at an angle of \u00b145\u25e6. At this angle it is\nabout one order of magnitude larger than the magnetic effect.\nThe present system has been investigated experimentally in\ndetail by Weller et al.1 . In this experiment different samples\nwere used at least one of which was a polycrystal with two\ntypes of crystallographic domains related to each other by a\n90\u25e6 rotation around the surface normal. Experimental results\n\ndo not report birefringent contributions nor a dependence on\nthe direction of the polarization vector. So our theoretical results for the single crystal presented here are very different\nfrom experimental findings. Still, there is no direct disagreement between theory and experiment simply because it is possible that the experimental data that was taken actually corresponds to the case when the polarization vector is along a main\ncrystal axis. For this case there is good agreement with theory\n(see Fig. 5). However we believe that this is not what was\nhappening. Rather we speculate that during measurements\nat some point different directions of the polarization vector\nwere used and still basically common polar MOKE was found\nwithout substantial dependence on the direction of the polarization vector. Let us for the moment focus on the sample\nwhich we know is a polycrystal. Then the conclusion is optical response of a polycrystal with two domain orientations\nis fundamentally different from the optical response of a singlecrystal, so in order to describe experiment correctly it is\nimportant to consider the full polycrystal rather than a singlecrystalline sample.\n\nC.\n\nOptical response of the bicrystal\n\nWe have calculated the optical response of a polycrystal\nwith two domain orientations. Our approach was to calculate\naverage Stokes parameters from our transfer matrix calculation as described in Sec. III. Experimental data about the distribution of domain sizes and intensities shining on them was\nnot known so we had to make an assumption here. We expect\nthat crystal growth occurrs with equal preferrence in both of\nthe two domain orientations so total surface areas should be\nthe same and total intensity of the incident light should be devided equally among the two orientations.\nResults are shown in Fig. 4. In general, we find now for\nany direction of the polarization vector that our calculated optical response is similar to common polar MOKE and theoretical results are now in good agreement with experimental data.\n\n\f7\n0\n\nellipticity (\n\n\u25e6)\n\nrotation (\n\n\u25e6)\n\nThe birefringent contribution, which for the single crystal was\nthe dominant contribution to the optical response, is now averaged out. However birefringent contribution is averaged out\ncompletely only in the ellipticity (in our computational result\n-0.2\nvariation under change of the direction of the polarization vector is of the order 10\u22124 \u25e6) while in the rotation it is still present.\nPSfrag\nreplacements\nIn general the results are quite surprising: For\nthe single\n-0.4\ncrystal birefringence was about 10 times larger than the magh112\u03040i polycrystal p||x\nnetic effect.

Our approach was\nbased on first-principle calculations of dielectric tensors. We\nhave addressed the electrodynamics part of the problem, i. e.,\nthe extraction of MOKE from dielectric tensors, with a transfer matrix method. We could describe simultaneous occurrence of birefringence and magnetic effect that is present in\nthe systems. For polycrystals average optical response was\ndescribed by exact average Stokes parameters taking into account the real orientations of domains.\nFor hcp h112\u03040i Co we found that a single crystal optical\nresponse depends strongly on the direction of the polarization vector. If the polarization vector is along one of the main\ncrystal axis optical response is very similar to common polar MOKE and moreover for the two crystal axis the optical\nresponse is basically the same. If the polarization vector deviates more than about 3\u25e6 from one of the main crystal axis birefringence is important. For larger angles it dominates over the\nactual magnetic effect. To explain experimental data we had to\nstress that samples investigated in experiment were polycrystals. We could show that already the presence of two domain\norientations leads to a strong reduction of birefringent contribution in the magneto-optical response. Finally we could\nshow that the previous interpretation of experimental data in\n\nterms of a manifestation of magneto-crystalline anisotropy in\nthe optical response remains valid.\nFor polycrystalline h010i CrO2 we found that the birefringent contribution to the optical response is averaged out completely. We could verify that a previous approximative analytic expression describes the optical response exactly also\nfor the case of realistic domain orientations.\nThe results of our LDA calculations for both hcp Co and\nCrO2 are in very good agreement with the experimental data\n(assuming that the data for Co are for a bi-crystal). This is not\ntrivial since, in general, correlation effects might be essential\nfor the electronic structure of transition metal ferromagnets30.\nThe effect of local Coulomb interactions on magneto-optical\nproperties of Fe and Ni has been calculated in Refs. 31,32 in\na framework of dynamical mean-field theory (LDA+DMFT\napproach). It appeared that, whereas for Ni the correlation\neffects are important, for Fe there are almost no difference between LDA and LDA+DMFT results for optical and magnetooptical properties. Our results show that probably correlation\neffects are not very important also for magneto-optical properties of Co. As for ferromagnetic CrO2 recent analysis33 shows\nthat it should be considered rather as a weakly correlated system so a success of our calculations is not surprising.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge stimulating discussions with\nThorsten Andersen, Peter Oppeneer and Till Burkert.

Three-dimensional distribution is found for surfaces of bulk polycrystals such as, e.g., natural iron. Ordered\ntwo-dimensional distribution is often found when thin polycrystalline films are grown on single-crystalline substrates. In\nthe case of three-dimensional distribution, the domain orientations are often to a good approximation random. The average polar MOKE of a three-dimensional random polycrystal\nis obviously independent of the direction of the polarization\nvector in the surface plane. We skip this case here as well\nas other three-dimensionally ordered polycrystals. Rather we\nfocus on polycrystals with a two-dimensional distribution of\ndomain orientations. We call a surface n-fold symmetrically\nordered if the crystallographic structures of all domains can\n\n\f10\nbe mapped onto each other by an n-fold rotation around the\nsurface normal. We will also use a notion of two-dimensional\ncontinuously distributed polycrystalline surface. By that we\nmean a polycrystalline surface in which the crystallographic\nstructures of the domains can be mapped onto each other\nby suitable continuous rotations around the surface normal\nand all possible orientations occur. This corresponds to twodimensional random domain orientations. Also for this case,\nthe average polar MOKE is obviously independent of the direction of the polarization vector.\nWe show now that for most polycrystals with symmetrically\nordered domains the average polar MOKE is equivalent to the\naverage polar MOKE of a continuously distributed polycrystal\nof the same material.\nIn particular we prove the following statement. The average\nStokes parameters hS0 i and hS3 i are identical to those of a\ncontinuous polycrystal if and only if the in plane symmetry\nof domain orientations is larger than two-fold and the Stokes\nparameters hS1 i and hS2 i are identical to those of a continuous\npolycrystal if and only if the in plane symmetry of domain\norientations is not 1, 2 or 4.\nWe begin the proof by considering the light reflected from\na single domain. If reflection is described by means of transfer matrix method, then, for any wave vector and frequency,\nthe complex amplitude of the reflected wave is a linear mapping of the complex amplitude of the incident wave. This can\nbe seen directly from the main linear equation, Eq. (14) . Further, in case of normal incidence, the incident and the reflected\namplitude vectors may be represented in a common coordinate system parallel to the surface plane. Thus, if E in and\nE re f l are respective 2-vectors, there is a linear transformation\nT : C2 \u2192 C2 such that\nE in .\nE re f l = TE\n\n(A1)\n\nNow let some other domain be identical to the previous one\nup to a rotation\n\u0013\n\u0012\ncos \u03c6 sin \u03c6\n(A2)\nR(\u03c6) =\n\u2212 sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6\naround the surface normal.\nre f l\nIf E 2 is the amplitude of the wave reflected from the second domain, we have\nre f l\nE in .\nE 2 = R(\u03c6)T R\u22121 (\u03c6)E\n\n(A3)\n\nNow consider an n-fold symmetrically ordered polycrystal.\nIntroducing angles \u03c6k = 2\u03c0 nk , k = 1, . . . , n, the amplitude vecre f l\ntors E k of the reflected waves are\nre f l\nE in .\nE k = R(\u03c6k )T R\u22121 (\u03c6k )E\n\nBy Eq.

It naturally decides thin polycrystalline films into three classes: 2-fold symmetrically ordered films, 4-fold symmetrically ordered films\nand all others including two-dimensional random orientation.\nFurther, it implies that for polycrystalline films out of the first\ntwo classes the optical response does in general depend on\nthe direction of the polarization vector, thus the birefringent\ncontribution to the optical response is in general not averaged\nout. On the other hand it implies that for polycrystals out of\nthe last class optical response is independent of the direction\nof the polarization vector, thus the birefringent contribution to\nthe optical response is averaged out.\n\nAPPENDIX B: SYMMETRIC SUMS OVER POWERS OF\nTRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS\n\nWe prove a statement about symmetric sums over powers\nof cos and sin.\nLet f : R \u2192 R and q \u2208 Q.

This completes the proof for S0 .\nConsider S1 and S2 .\nIn contrast to S0 , both S1 and S2 are no scalar products.\nThus, we have to evaluate the full expression RT R\u22121E . With\nEq. (C4) and Eq. (C5) we get\nRT R\u22121 =\n\nc2 Txx + csTxy + csTyx + s2 Tyy\n\u2212csTxx \u2212 s2 Txy + c2 Tyx + csTyy\n\n!

R is\northogonal, thus\n(RT R\u22121E , RT R\u22121E ) = (T R\u22121E , T R\u22121E ),\n\n1\n2\u03c0\n\n(C3)\n\n+ (\u2212csTxx + c2Txy \u2212 s2 Tyx + csTyy )b,\n\nEy\u2032 = (\u2212csTxx \u2212 s2 Txy + c2 Tyx + csTyy )a\n\n+ (s2 Txx \u2212 csTxy \u2212 csTyx + c2 Tyy )b.\n\n(C9)\n\n\f13\nBy Eq.

(C9), every resulting term contains factors of cos and sin of the form\nconsidered in Eq. (B1) or Eq. (B2). These terms might add up\nto combined terms out of the last four lines of Eq. (B1) or the\nlast three lines of Eq. (B2). To check, if we have at least one\nindependent term out of Eq. (B2), we focus on expressions\nwith a factor Txx T xx .
