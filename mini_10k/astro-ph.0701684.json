We found that there is a strong Fe II emission in an\nextensive region \u223c 4\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 4\u2032\u2032 around Sy 1 nucleus. The Fe II line width indicates\nthat these lines are originated in an intermediate line region.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMrk 493, a narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy (NLS1), has a strong Fe II emission.\nIt was shown by Boroson & Green (1992) that a strong anticorrelation between\nthe strengths of the [OIII] and Fe II exists in the optical spectra, with NLS1 as\na class showing the strongest Fe II and weakest [OIII] emission. The observed\nline widths and absence of forbidden emission suggests that Fe II is formed in\nthe dense broad-line region (BLR), but photoionization models cannot account\nfor all of the Fe II emission. The 'Fe II discrepancy' remains unsolved, though\nmodels which consider non-radiative heating, with an overabundance of iron are\npromising (see paper of Joly in this proceedings). We performed 3D spectroscopic observations of Mrk 493 in order (i) to find the structure of the Fe II\nemitting region and possible connection with other emitting regions and (ii) to\nmap the circum-nuclear emitting gas.\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nMrk 493 was observe in August 2002 and May 2004 with the integral-field MultiPupil Fiber Spectrograph (MPFS), mounted at the primary focus of the SAO\nRAS 6-m telescope (Afanasiev et al., 2004). The MPFS takes simultaneous\nspectra from 256 spatial elements that collects an area of 16 \u00d7 16\u2032\u2032 on the sky\n(see full description at http://www.sao.ru/hq/lsfvo/devices.html). The spectral\ninterval was 4500 \u2212 7100\u00c5 with resolution of 7-8 \u00c5 (in 2002) and 4350 \u2212 5900\u00c5\nwith resolution of 4.5\u00c5 (in 2004).\n1\n\n\f2\n\nL. \u010c.

We\nfound that the broad H\u03b2 can be decomposed into two components (broad \u2013 WB\nand intermediate \u2013 WI ) indicating the random velocity of emitting gas around\nWB =2400 km/s and WI =600 km/s. On the other hand, the widths of Fe II\nlines indicate the velocity gas in the Fe II emission region around WF eII =800\nkm/s, that is closer to the intermediate region. This indicates that Fe II lines\noriginate in an intermediate line region as it was mentioned in Popovi\u0107 et al.\n(2004)\nAcknowledgments.
