Magnetic Fields in the Galactic Neighborhood\nGoal of White Paper: A combination of observation, theory, modeling, and laboratory\nplasma experiments provides a multifaceted approach to develop a much greater\nunderstanding of how magnetic fields arise in galactic settings and how these magnetic\nfields mediate important processes that affect the dynamics, distribution, and composition\nof galactic plasmas. An important emphasis below is the opportunity to connect\nlaboratory experiments to astrophysics. This approach is especially compelling for the\ngalactic neighborhood, where the distribution and character of magnetic fields can be\nobserved with greater detail than what is possible elsewhere in the universe. The ability\nto produce laboratory plasmas with unparalleled accessibility permits an even greater\nlevel of detail to be assessed and exposed. Theory and modeling provide fundamental\nways to understand important processes, and they act as the bridge to connect\nexperimental validation to astronomical observations. In many cases the studies that\nutilize this approach can make use of existing laboratory facilities, resulting in a cost that\nis quite small compared to the cost of measurements in dedicated space missions.\nImportance of magnetic fields: Magnetic fields are ubiquitous in space, and their role in\naffecting astrophysical processes is difficult to overestimate. For instance, they are\nknown to be important in the acceleration of cosmic rays, star formation (because their\npressure often prevents cloud collapse), and MHD heating of the interstellar medium. To\nunderstand these cosmic fields, we must, first of all, understand their dynamics in\nturbulent plasmas (\"magnetic turbulence\"), the dynamics of magnetic field amplification\n(usually called \"dynamo\"), and topology changes (\"reconnection\"). Complex interaction\nof magnetic fields with plasmas and cosmic rays, and the back-reaction of these processes\non the magnetic field dynamics and structure, makes these processes difficult to describe\nquantitatively. Therefore, the Galactic Neighborhood provides an ideal testing ground\nwhere high resolution observations can be compared with theoretical modeling,\nnumerical simulations and laboratory experiment. In the text below we discuss magnetic\nprocesses that span 12 orders of magnitude of scales.\nThe major questions relevant to this topic are: \"How are magnetic fields created at the\nGalactic scale? How do they mediate the interstellar dynamics over a tremendous range\nof scales, from 1000pc to 100km? How is magnetic energy irreversibly converted into\nheat and fast particles?\"\nObservational progress: New instruments that are going to be available in the next\ndecade, e.g. SKA, LOFAR, ALMA can provide much better quantitative insight into\nmagnetic field properties and structure. Detailed polarimetry surveys as well as new\ntechniques of studying magnetic field, e.g. through Hanle effect and atomic alignment,\nexpand further the prospects of the observational studies. Thus the time will be ripe for\ndetailed comparisons of observations with theoretical expectations.\nOrganization of the paper: For clarity in discussion, we separate the discussion of\nmagnetic fields according to their scale: (1) largest scale (section II), (2) meso or\nintermediate (section III), and (3) small scale (section IV) usually associated with\n\n2\n\n\fdissipation mechanisms. For each of these there are important questions and identifiable\nprocesses. Though the scale separation is convenient for discussion, it is important to\nrecognize that all scales are connected. Indeed, the role of magnetic fields in mediating\nmatter and energy at different scales is one of the major points we highlight. We also\nstress the importance of understanding properties of magnetic fields in the Galactic\nNeighborhood for quantitative modeling of extragalactic processes and reliable\nseparation of CMB and foreground polarization (section V). A short summary is provided\nin section VI. Sections II, III, and IV contains sub-questions which are necessary to\naddress in answering the major questions above.\nII. Large scale Field\nA magnetic field is present on the scale of the Galaxy1 (103 parsec scale). Its origin is\nusually attributed to the galactic dynamo, the operation of which is poorly understood.\nUnfortunately, the traditional textbook mean field dynamo theory does not conserve\nmagnetic helicity, contrary to observations in laboratory plasma experiments and\ntheoretical expectations2. In addition, the inverse cascade of magnetic helicity in a\nturbulent plasma is very much influenced by the correlations between the velocity and\nmagnetic field fluctuations, which are inherently weak within the accepted treatments of\ndynamo.\nThe key questions here are: \"What is the correct formulation of dynamo theory? What is\nthe role of velocity and magnetic field correlations for magnetic field generation?\"\nLaboratory studies provide a new outlook on the problem. For instance, spontaneous yet\nrobust magnetic flux conversion (a central component of the dynamo process) observed\nin laboratory fusion research plasmas like the reversed field pinch suggest that large-scale\ndynamo can be generated by instabilities in which the magnetic and velocity fluctuations\nare dynamically linked3. Using an array of sophisticated measurements, laboratory fusion\nexperiments offer great opportunity to test new ways of approaching the dynamo.\nAdvanced computations offer the opportunity to explore further the inherently nonlinear\nmechanisms.\nUnfortunately, there has been almost no investigation of laboratory plasmas with\nrelatively high beta and large plasma flows so that the system is kinetic-energy\ndominated. For instance, the strongly magnetized laboratory fusion plasmas like the\nreversed field pinch are magnetic-energy dominated. However, high beta plasmas with\nlarge plasma flows are experimentally accessible, and would provide a first-time\nopportunity to investigate astrophysically relevant plasma conditions in which the kinetic\nenergy dominates. In fact, one possible approach uses a two-vortex flow generated by\noppositely directed rotation in the upper and lower hemispheres of a spherical\nconfinement chamber. This flow is similar to the two vortex flow first described in\nDudley and James4, which has been shown to self-excite above a critical magnetic\nReynolds number > 350. In addition, a convection driven alpha-omega dynamo\nexperiment is feasible. Differential rotation can efficiently generate a strong toroidal\nfield from a relatively weak poloidal field through the omega effect. Helical turbulence\n\n3\n\n\fcan be generated by injecting light ions into a strongly rotating, heavy ion flow. The\nturbulence is expected to regenerate the poloidal field from the toroidal field and thereby\nclose the feedback loop required for self-excitation. This suggests, that if the laboratory\nstudies above are combined with numerical and analytical efforts, a new approach to the\nmagnetic field generation can be developed.\nApart from conserving helicity, the galactic dynamo requires changes of the magnetic\nfield topology that are enabled by reconnection. Recent years have been marked by\nremarkable progress in simulating fast collisionless reconnection5. This type of\nreconnection is restricted, however, to situations where the length of the current sheet is\nno more than several times larger than the electron mean free path . This regime is not\napplicable to interstellar gas, for which the reconnection is collisional6. If collisionless\nreconnection is the only type of fast reconnection, this means that most of the interstellar\nMHD codes do not correctly represent astrophysical reality! Indeed, the inevitable\nnumerical diffusivity in the codes makes reconnection generically fast. This potential\ndifference not only raises serious questions about simulations of the galactic dynamo, but\nalso the entire crop of simulations of interstellar medium dynamics, star formation, etc.\nIn fact, the absence of codes to properly simulate interstellar magnetic fields, might\nurgently require starting numerical interstellar research from scratch, e.g., first via\ncreation of a new generation of codes that explicitly forbid reconnection. Whether most\nof the current interstellar simulations are astrophysically irrelevant depends on whether a\nfast reconnection process in collisional environments will be proven to operate.\nThe outstanding questions here are: \"How can reconnection proceed in collisional\nenvironments? Can turbulence accelerate reconnection? How does partial ionization of\ninterstellar plasma affect reconnection speeds? What are the consequences of magnetic\nreconnection for key interstellar processes?\" These burning questions can and must be\naddressed through the synergy of the theory with laboratory and numerical experiments.\nIncidentally, this does not mean attempts to exactly reproduce astrophysical conditions in\nthe laboratory, but rescaling plasma characteristics in the case of laboratory research and\ntesting theoretical scalings for the regimes accessible numerically. The consequences of\nsuch studies, e.g., predictions of cosmic ray acceleration if magnetic reconnection is fast,\nshould be tested observationally.\nIII. Meso and Intermediate Scales\nThe interstellar medium (ISM) supports a remarkable self-organizing process in the form\nof a turbulent energy cascade observed through the fluctuation spectrum of electron\ndensity, fluctuating component of the magnetic field, and fluctuations of Doppler shifted\nemission/absorption lines. The extraordinarily broad range of scales encompassed by the\ncascade, from dozens of parsecs to hundreds of kilometers7, makes it a potent participant\nand regulator in a variety of processes. It is a conduit of magnetic energy across these\nscales, linking large scale stirring from super novae, stellar winds and large-scale\ninstabilities. At the smallest scales it is thermalized by dissipative processes that are\nlikely to be common to ion heating in the solar corona, to anisotropic pressures in the\nsolar wind, reconnection, etc.\n\n4\n\n\fMagnetic turbulence is important at all scales and in all phases of the interstellar medium.\nIt plays a key role in generating and structuring large-scale magnetic fields that help to\ntrap, scatter and accelerate cosmic rays. It modifies large-scale instabilities, thus affecting\ndynamics of galactic matter. It mediates energy transfer from large Galactic scales to\nsmall dissipation scales via a turbulent cascade, thus affecting interstellar plasma heating.\nIt mixes and homogenizes the interstellar gas, which is intermittently \"polluted\" by\nsupernovae, thus affecting the interstellar chemistry. It plays a crucial role in density\nfragmentation in cold molecular clouds, thus mediating the process of star formation8.\nCrucial aspects of the physics of the cascade above are not well understood and hotly\ndebated. The problem here is that the commonly used brute force numerical approach\nhas serious limitations. First of all, if reconnection in the interstellar medium happens to\nbe slow, there is a possibility (which has not yet been convincingly refuted) that all\nsimulation related to the interstellar medium, including those of turbulence have\nsignificnant errors due to a dramatic disparity between the rates of astrophysical and\nnumerical reconnection. If the reconnection rates in collisional environments are proven\nto be fast, there still exists a problem of the enormous disparity of the magnetic Reynolds\nnumbers (Rm) in simulations and interstellar gas. The aforementioned Rm, which\ncharacterize the degree of frozenness of magnetic field within eddies, may differ by a\nfactor larger than 1010, which, naturally, calls for caution while interpreting numerical\nresults. In addition, the turbulence takes place in a multiphase medium, where observed\ninterstellar structures cover not only a large range of scales but also a large range of\ndensities and temperatures. On top of all this, interstellar turbulence has spatially\nlocalized sources and sinks, which makes magnetic wave disturbances imbalanced in\nterms of the magnitudes of oppositely propagating wave components.\nTraditionally, analytic and numerical studies of magnetic turbulence have concentrated\non the homogeneous and incompressible cases. However, astrophysical plasmas indicate\nan urgent necessity for addressing much broader regimes. Among the most relevant\nproblems are the turbulent generation of magnetic fields (as observations indicate that\nmagnetic energy can sometimes be below the equipartition energy), the description of\ncompressible turbulence (as compressibility is very important for the interstellar\nmedium), the study of turbulence with a different ratio of magnetic to thermal energy (as\nthis ratio varies for different interstellar phases), the study of turbulence with a strong and\nweak guide field (as the ratio of random to regular magnetic field vary in the ISM), the\nstudy of imbalanced turbulence where energy fluxes in opposite directions along the\nguide field are non-equal (as expected in the presence of sources of turbulence), the study\nof turbulence in partially ionized gas (as ISM hosts a lot of neutral atoms), etc.\nThe basic questions of astrophysical interest include: What is the turbulence spectrum\nand its anisotropy? How strong is the coupling of the fundamental MHD modes, i.e. slow,\nfast and Alfven modes in the cascade? How fast does the turbulence decay? These\nquestions should be addressed for the different regimes above.\n\n5\n\n\fThe complexity of the problem calls for a synergetic approach combining concerted and\ncoordinated effort involving observations of the local ISM, measurements in related\nlaboratory plasmas, development of theory and supporting numerical computation\u03b1.\nThe importance of laboratory studies for understanding astrophysical turbulence is\nfrequently underestimated. Consider Fig. 1, which reveals similarities between the\nmagnetic fluctuation spectra from solar wind observations and from the Madison\nSymmetric Torus (MST)3. Both spectra show magnetic fluctuation spectra with apparent\npower-law-like falloff, with putative knees in the rough vicinity of gyroradius scales, and\nboth have been argued to be subject to cyclotron resonance dissipation. Laboratory\nplasmas like MST offer unexcelled diagnostic access relative to astrophysical plasmas,\nincorporating techniques based on laser scattering, beam emission, Thompson scattering,\nand spectroscopy. Some methodologies and technologies, such as Faraday rotation based\npolarimetry, are shared with astrophysical observation, allowing direct interchange of\nadvances. MST is just one example of laboratory opportunities.\n\nFig. 1 a) Spectrum of solar wind turbulence from Smith et al. b) Spectrum of magnetic\nturbulence in the Madison Symmetric Torus.\nIV. Dissipation Scales and Microscales\nObservations indicate that small-scale density structures (from hundred to several AU)\nare present in interstellar gas9. This is indicative of magnetic self-organization taking\nplace at the scales approaching the turbulence dissipation scale. Solar flares accompanied\nby acceleration of energetic particles are examples of magnetic reconnection and transfer\nof magnetic energy to particle acceleration. At the same time, solar corona observations\nindicate heating of the heavy element ions (\"minor ions\"), which are believed to be a\nconsequence of the magnetic turbulence dissipation10.\nThe self-similar inertial range of the turbulence that originates at the injection turbulence\nscale is truncated at the dissipation scale\u03b2. The latter scale depends on the nature of the\n\n\u03b1\n\nWhile we stressed the problems of the brute force approach, numerics is indispensable\nfor testing theoretical predictions/scalings for the range of Reynolds and magnetic\nReynolds numbers accessible by modern computers.\n6\n\n\fcascade and the properties of the particular astrophysical environment. For instance, in\nhighly ionized interstellar medium magnetosonic fast modes can be damped through\ncollisionless damping, while Alfven modes can propagate to smaller scales. Similarly, the\ndissipation of magnetic turbulence may vary in the presence cosmic rays, neutral atoms,\nminority ions, charged dust etc. As turbulence dissipates it heats the medium, transfers\nits energy to energetic particles, induces various plasma effects. Understanding of the key\nprocesses in most cases requires going beyond the MHD treatment of the fluid. For\ninstance, the redistribution of heating between protons and electrons may depend on the\nanisotropy of whistler turbulence 11.\nMoreover, the dissipation of turbulence can happen intermittently through the volume.\nDepending on the degree of intermittency the consequences of turbulence may vary\ndramatically. For instance, Falgarone et al.12 showed that intermittent turbulence can\ndramatically alter interstellar chemistry, via exothermal reactions induced by very\nconcentrated vortices. Whether or not such a radical revision of interstellar chemistry\nparadigm is necessary depends on the degree of the actual turbulence intermittency.\nThe relevant questions are: How does MHD turbulence dissipate? How does the energy\nget distributed between charge carriers of different mass? How high is the intermittency\nof energy dissipation?\nAlso, gyro-kinetic simulations of the turbulent dissipation in plasma, two fluid\nsimulations of turbulent dissipation in partially ionized gas open wide avenues for testing\nproperties of magnetic fields on small scales numerically. In addition, both in situ\nmagnetic field measurements and observations of the solar corona can be another vital\nsource of information. However, the role of laboratory experiments should not be\nunderestimated. For instance, MST turbulence (see Figure 1) shows evidence for the\ntype of magnetic wave activity that govern magnetic turbulence in the interstellar\nmedium as turbulence enters scales where electron compressibility effects arise, and is\nassociated with ion heating.\nV. Broad Impact of Better Understanding of Magnetic Fields\nThe synergetic approach described above for studies of magnetic fields in the Galactic\nNeighborhood can clarify the role that magnetic fields play in the dynamics and physics\nof fundamental astrophysical processes, e.g., transport of heat and cosmic rays, star\nformation, accretion. This should help quantify the effect of astrophysical magnetic field\nin extragalactic systems for which high-resolution observations are not readily available.\nThe studies of the properties of magnetic fields in the Galactic neighborhood should\nprovide important input for realistic parametrization of key extragalactic astrophysical\nprocesses. For instance, if the role of magnetic field and magnetic turbulence in star\nformation is clarified, this will boost the reliability of extragalactic simulations that\nrequire the star formation rates as their input. Similarly, understanding of magnetic\n\u03b2\n\nThe degree of self-similarity in the inertial range is debated issue that requires further\ninvestigation, however.\n7\n\n\freconnection should shed light on many fundamental astrophysical processes, including\naccretion of matter. Last, but not the least, understanding of magnetic field structure in\nthe Galactic neighborhood is important to understand the properties of polarized\nforegrounds that interfere with the CMB polarization.\nVI. Summary: Towards Quantitative Understanding of Magnetic Fields\nMagnetic fields on different scales are interrelated and interdependent. For instance, the\nstructure of magnetic field which is governed by the galactic large scale dynamo depends\non reconnection, which may depend either on the properties of magnetic turbulence at the\nmesoscales or even on properties of plasma at microscales comparable with the proton\ngyroradius. The advocated synergetic approach includes the traditional interplay between\nexperiment, observations, and theory in developing a conceptual picture and\nunderstanding; the validation of numerical algorithms by appropriate comparison with\nexperiment; and the application of validated codes to astrophysical phenomena. The later\nallows gaps in parameter regimes between laboratory and astrophysical plasmas to be\nbridged, through analysis and synthesis of common physics.\nSeveral recent developments make this problem ripe as a high priority effort. Magnetic\nfields in near earth galactic environment are readily accessible and observable via\ndispersion techniques, rotation measure, polarimetry, spectroscopy, etc. In addition, the\nwealth of spectroscopic surveys provides complementary input on the velocity\nfluctuations, which carry essential signatures of interstellar turbulence. Moreover, there is\nthe opportunity of synthesis from observations of the solar wind, solar corona, and\nmagnetospheric and auroral plasmas.\nAs a result of implementing of this approach the fundamental properties of magnetic\nfields, including their generation by dynamo and turbulence, their dynamical impact on\ngalactic processes, which heavily depends on the properties of turbulence and the\nreconnection speed, their interaction with cosmic rays, and, finally, production of\nenergetic particles and heating, can be substantially clarified. This progress will have\nbroad impact, as magnetic fields are not confined to the Galactic Neighborhood but are\nreally ubiquitous in Astrophysics.\nVII. References\n1.
