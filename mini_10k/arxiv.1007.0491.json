In this paper we show that\nit can lead to far-reaching consequences if it is \"resolved\" with the help of\nsuitably sensitive tools. Non-Hausdorff spaces, often regarded as a technical\nnuisance, sometimes produce a global disaster. This happens when large domains of the considered space, or even the entire space, topologically collapse\nto a single point (in the latter case, we say that the Hausdorff relation is of\nthe total type). The sign of such a disaster is that only functional algebras\nconsisting of constant functions can be defined on these domains or spaces.\nExamples of such situations are many: the space of Penrose tilings [8], the\nleaf space of foliations [3], space-times of some cosmological models with\nstrong curvature singularities [2, 6]. As it is well known, with every equivalence relation a groupoid can be associated allowing one to employ various\ntechniques typical for groupoids [7]. It turns out that these techniques, when\napplied to the groupoid associated with the Hausdorff relation, lead to interesting conclusions. This is less surprising if we notice that the Hausdorff\nrelation is strictly connected with the individuality of points in a given space\n(Lemma 1 below) or, in other words, with the very nature of this space.\nIn Carlo Rovelli's opinion, the main challenge of the present search for\nquantum gravity theory is \"understanding what is a background independent\nquantum field theory\" [9, p. 8]. The meaning of the term itself \"background\nindependent theory\" is not very clear, but the most radical versions of its\nunderstanding claim that we should get rid of points altogether. This is exactly what happens when the Hausdorff relation is of the total type. But\nthen the traditional approach in terms of coordinates and atlases gives place\n\n2\n\n\fto a \"spectral\" approach in terms of noncommutative algebras and their representations. The so called regular representation (in the bundle of Hilbert\nspaces) of a noncommutative algebra on the Hausdorff groupoid leads to a\nvon Neumann algebra (called von Neumann algebra of the groupoid) the\nelements of which are random operators. It seems natural that loosing information about points results in a probabilistic type of reasoning, albeit in\na generalized sense (probability measures are given here by normal, faithful\nand normalized to unity states on the von Neumann algebra). As the consequence of this, we are able to formulate the commutation relation between\ntwo operators which, in the limit to the Hausdorff case, reproduces the known\ncommutation relation between position and momentum operators. It should\nbe emphasized that this result is purely geometric and does not depend of\nany particular physical assumptions.\nThe composition of our material runs as follows. In Sect. 2, we formulate\nHausdorff relation in an algebraic language and, in Sect. 3, we give the\nconstruction of the Hausdorff groupoid and a noncommutative algebra on\nit. In Sect. 4, we present the von Neumann algebra of random operators\nassociated with the Hausdorff groupoid. In Sect. 5, we consider a (finite)\nsequence of algebras (and the Hausdorff groupoids corresponding the them)\nsuch that the first algebra in the sequence corresponds to the situation in\nwhich all points are non-Hausdorff separated from each other, and the last\nalgebra in the sequence to the space satisfying the Hausdorff axiom. We\ncall this the noncommutative deformation of the latter algebra. In Sect.\n6, we compute the commutator of the generalized position and momentum\noperators. Finally, in Sect. 7, we make some interpretative remarks.\n\n2\n\nHausdorff Equivalence Relation\n\nLet us consider a family C of real valued functions on a set M. We endow\nM with the weakest topology, denoted \u03c4C , in which the functions of C are\ncontinuous. A function f defined on U \u2282 M is said to be a local C-function\nif, for every x \u2208 U, there exist a neighborhood V of x in the topological\nspace (U, \u03c4U ), where \u03c4U is the topology in U induced by \u03c4C , and a function\ng \u2208 C such that f |V = g|V . Let us denote by CU the set of all such local\nC-functions. We have C \u2282 CM . If C = CM , the family C is said to be\nclosed with respect to localization. If, for any n \u2208 N and every function\n\u03c9 \u2208 C \u221e (Rn ), we have f1 , . . . , fn \u2208 C implies \u03c9 \u25e6 (f1 , . . . , fn ) \u2208 C then the\n3\n\n\ffamily C is said to be closed with respect to superposition with Euclidean\nfunctions. If the family C is closed with respect to localization and closed\nwith respect to superposition with Euclidean functions, the family C is said\nto be a differential structure on M, and the pair (M, C) a differential space.\nAny function belonging to C is said to be smooth (in the sense of differential\nspaces). If C = C \u221e (M), the differential space is a differential manifold (for\nthe theory of differential spaces see [5]). In the following we shall assume\nthat (M, C) is a differential manifold or a differential space.\nWe define the Hausdorff relation \u03c1H \u2282 M \u00d7 M in the following way\nx\u03c1H y \u21d4 \u2200f \u2208C f (x) = f (y), x, y \u2208 M. It is clearly an equivalence relation.\nLet \u03c1 \u2282 M \u00d7 M be any equivalence relation. We define two families of\nfunctions. First,\nC/\u03c1 = {f \u0304 : M/\u03c1 \u2192 R : f \u0304 \u25e6 \u03c0\u03c1 }\nwhere \u03c0\u03c1 : M \u2192 m/\u03c1 is the canonical projection. This family is the largest\ndifferential structure on M/\u03c1 in which \u03c0\u03c1 is smooth (in the sense of the theory\nof differential spaces). Second,\nC\u03c1 = {f \u2208 C : \u2200x,y\u2208M f (x) = f (y)}.\nFunctions belonging to C\u03c1 are called \u03c1-consistent.\nThere exists the isomorphism of linear algebras \u03a6 : C/\u03c1 \u2192 C\u03c1 given by\n\u03a6(f \u0304) = f \u0304 \u25e6 \u03c0\u03c1 for f \u0304 \u2208 C/\u03c1.\nLemma 1 The algebra C\u03c1H of \u03c1H -consistent functions coincides with the\nalgebra C, i.e., every function of C is \u03c1H -consistent.\nProof. On the one hand, x\u03c1H y \u21d2 f (x) = f (y) \u21d2 f \u2208 C\u03c1H , therefore\nC \u2282 C\u03c1H . On the other hand, C\u03c1H \u2282 C as its subalgebra. \u22c4\nThis lemma says that the Hausdorff relation \u03c1H is intimately related to the\ndifferential structure C. It is, in a sense, responsible for the individualization\nof points in a given space. We clearly have the differential space (M/\u03c1H , C\u03c1H )\nthe points of which are [x] = {y \u2208 M : \u2200f \u2208C f (y) = f (x)}.\n\n3\n\nHausdorff Groupoid\n\nAs it is well known, each equivalence relation gives rise to a groupoid [3].\nIt turns out that, in the case of the Hausdorff equivalence relation, the corresponding groupoid proves to be very useful in the study of even strongly\n4\n\n\fnon-Hausdorff spaces. We call it Hausdorff groupoid and denote by \u0393. We\nnow briefly describe its construction.\nWe identify \u0393 with the graph of the Hausdorff relation\n\u03c1H = {(x, y) \u2208 M \u00d7 M : \u2200f \u2208C f (x) = f (y)}.\nLet (x, y), (y, z) \u2208 \u0393, then the multiplication is given by (x, y)\u25e6(y, z) = (x, z),\nthe inverse by (x, y)\u22121 = (y, x), and the identity by (x, x). The source and\ntarget mappings are given by d(x, y) = x and r(x, y) = y, respectively. The\nfollowing sets are defined: the set of elements beginning at x, \u0393x = {(x, y) :\nx\u03c1H y} = d\u22121 (x), the set of elements ending at y, \u0393y = {(x, y) : x\u03c1H y} =\nr \u22121 (y), and the isotropy group \u0393xx = \u0393x \u2229 \u0393x = {(x, x) : x \u2208 M}. In general\nthe groupoid \u0393 is not transitive.\nLet us first assume that the relation \u03c1H is of the finite type, i.e., that the\nnumber of points identified under \u03c1H is denumerable. We define the algebra\nA = Cc\u221e (\u0393) of smooth, complex valued, compactly supported functions on\n\u0393 with the convolution\n(f \u2217 g)(x, y) =\n\nX\n\nx\u03c1H z \u03c1H y\n\nf (x, z)g(z, y),\n\nf, g \u2208 A , as multiplication. We also define the involution by f \u2217 (x, y) =\n(y, x).\nIf a differential space (M, C) is Hausdorff then, for every x \u2208 M, [x]\u03c1H =\n{x}, (f \u2217 g)(x, x) = f (x, x)g(x, x) and \u0393 = \u0393(0) = {(x, x) : x \u2208 M} is\ndiffeomorphic with M. In consequence, the algebra A is isomorphic with C.\nLet us define the Hilbert space Hx = L2 (\u0393x ) and the bundle of Hilbert\nspaces H = (Hx )x\u2208M . Then we have the regular representation of the algebra\nA in Hx , \u03c0x : A \u2192 B(Hx ), given by\n(\u03c0x (a)\u03c8)(x, y) =\n\nX\n\nx\u03c1H z\n\na(x, z)\u03c8(z, y),\n\nfor a \u2208 A, \u03c8 \u2208 Hx . If the support is compact, the sum is finite. We thus\nhave\nA \u220b a 7\u2192 \u03c0(a) = (\u03c0x (a))x\u2208M := ra .\n\n5\n\n\f4\n\nVon Neumann Algebra Associated with\nHausdorff Relation\n\nIn sections 4 \u2013 5, we consider the case when M is a differential manifold of\na finite dimension and the Hausdorff relation \u03c1H is of the total type, i.e.,\n[x]\u03c1H = M for every x \u2208 M.\nWe define the algebra A = Cc\u221e (M \u00d7 M) and the convolution\n(a \u2217 b)((x, y) =\n\nZ\n\nM\n\na(x, z)b(z, y)d\u03bb(z),\n\nfor a, b \u2208 A, where d\u03bb is the usual manifold measure. Since the functions of\nA are of compact support, the integral is well defined.\nWe define the representation \u03c0x : A \u2192 B(H) of the algebra A in the\nHilbert space Hx = L2 (\u0393x ) by\n(\u03c0x (a))(z, x) =\n\nZ\n\nM\n\na(z, y)\u03c8(y, z)d\u03bb(y),\n\nfor a \u2208 A, \u03c8 \u2208 H, and consider the isomorphic image M0 of A by \u03c0 :=\n(\u03c0x )x\u2208M\nM0 = \u03c0(A) = {(\u03c0x (a))x\u2208M , a \u2208 A}.\nThe algebra M0 can be completed to the von Neumann algebra M,\nR\n= M, where M\u20320 is a commutant of M0 in the Hilbert space \u2295 Hx d\u03bb(x).\nThis von Neumann algebra is called von Neumann algebra of the groupoid\n\u0393 [7].\n\nM\u2032\u20320\n\nProposition 1 Von Neumann algebra M is an algebra of random operators.\nProof. Random operator acting on a Hilbert bundle H = (Hx )x\u2208X is a\nfunction\nA : X \u220b x 7\u2192 Ax \u2208 B(Hx )\nsuch that\n\u221e\n1. If {\u03c8i }\u221e\ni=1 is a field of bases in Hx , x \u2208 X, i.e., if {\u03c8i (x)}i=1 is a base in\nHx , then the function\n\nX \u220b\u2192 (Ax \u03c8i (x), \u03c8j (x))x \u2208 R,\ni, j = 1, 2, . . ., is measurable,\n6\n\n\f2. the family of operators Ax , x \u2208 X, is essentially bounded in the operator norm, i.e., ess sup||Ax || < \u221e.\nIt is straightforward to check that the operators ra = {\u03c0x (a)}x\u2208M , for every\na \u2208 A, satisfy these conditions. \u22c4\nThe concept of randomness is an element of the probability panorama.\nWe shall now reconstruct the probabilistic environment for this concept. Let\nus notice that Hx = L2 (\u0393x ) is isomorphic with L2 (M) and let us consider\nthe functional\nZ\n\u03a6(r) =\ntrx (\u03c1r)d\u03bb(x),\n\u02c6\nM\n\nfor r \u2208 M, where the density function on M, \u03c1\u0302 : M \u2192 B(Hx ), is such that\n1. \u03c1\u0302 is trace class, i.e., for every x \u2208 M, trx \u03c1\u0302(x) < \u221e,\n2. trx \u03c1\u0302 \u2208 L1 (M) is an integrable function,\n3. for every x \u2208 M, \u03c1\u0302(x) is a positive operator,\n4. the normalization condition holds\n\nR\n\nM\n\ntrx (\u03c1\u0302(x))d\u03bb(x) = 1.\n\nThe functional \u03a6(r) with the above conditions is called a normal state\non the von Neumann algebra M. If additionally \u03c1\u0302 is an injection, the state\n\u03a6(r) is called faithful.\nIn noncommutative mathematics, not necessarily commutative algebras\nare regarded as leading to the concept of generalized probability space. More\nstrictly, the noncommutative probability space is defined to be a pair (M, \u03c6)\nwhere M is a von Neumann algebra and \u03c6 a faithful and normal state on\nM [1]. Noncommutative probability theory is quickly developing branch of\nmodern mathematics [4]. In contrast to the commutative case, the noncommutative case exhibits the great richness of possibilities. In a noncommutative regime, probabilistic properties of a physical system can strongly depend\non the state in which this system finds itself.\n\n5\n\nNoncommutative Deformation of a Manifold\n\nSo far we considered two extreme cases: (1) when the relation \u03c1H \u2282 M \u00d7 M\nwas of the finite type, i.e., when the number of points identified under \u03c1H\n7\n\n\fwas denumerable; (2) when the Hausdorff relation \u03c1H \u2282 M \u00d7 M was of the\ntotal type, i.e., when all points of M were identified under \u03c1H . When the\nHausdorff relation \u03c1H is not of the total type, the Hausdorff groupoid \u0393 is\na disjoint sum of groupoids \u0393[x] such that \u0393[x] = [x] \u00d7 [x], where [x] is the\nequivalence class of x, i.e., every component groupoid \u0393[x] is of the total type.\nAs an example let us consider the following situation. Let M be a measurable subset of Rn , and let us consider the differential space (M, C) with\nthe differential structure on M induced from Rn , i.e., C = C \u221e (Rn )M . On\nthe strength of the embedding theorem, M can be assumed to be a differential manifold. Let now \u0393 = \u03c1 \u2282 M \u00d7 M where \u03c1 is any equivalence relation.\nWe say that \u03c1 is of measurable type if the equivalence class [x] is measurable\nfor every x \u2208 M. We define the algebra A = Cf\u221ec (\u0393) of smooth functions on\n\u0393 which are compact along fibres of \u0393 (\"fibre compact\") with the convolutive\nmultiplication\nZ\n(a \u2217 b)(x, y) =\na(x, z)b(z, y)d\u03bc(z),\n[x]\n\na, b \u2208 A, x, y \u2208 \u0393. We assume that [x] is of measurable type.\nProposition 2 If \u03c4c/\u03c1 is T1 then \u03c1 is of measurable type.\nProof. If \u03c4C/\u03c1 is T1 then the sets {[x]}, for any x \u2208 M, are closed in\n(M/\u03c1, \u03c4C/\u03c1 ). Consequently, the equivalence class is closed in (M, \u03c4C ) since\n[x] = \u03c0\u03c1\u22121 ([x]) and the mapping \u03c0\u03c1 is continuous. Therefore, the subset of\nthe form [x] \u2282 M, x \u2208 M, as a closed set, is measurable. \u22c4\nIn the following, we shall consider the projections \u03c0i |M \u2192 R given by\n(\u03c0i |M)(x1 , . . . , xn ) = xi , and proceed in the subsequent steps.\nStep 0. Let C0 = Gen{1}M \u223c\n= R be a differential structure on M, and\nlet \u03c10 = M \u00d7 M be defined by x\u03c10 y \u21d4 \u2200\u03b1\u2208C0 \u03b1(x) = \u03b1(y). This relation is of\nthe total type and everything is as in Sections 4 and 5.\nStep k, k = 1, . . . , n\u22121. The differential structure Ck is generated by projections, Ck = Gen{\u03c01 , . . . , \u03c0k }, and x\u03c1k y \u21d4 \u03c0i (x) = \u03c0i (y) for i = 1, . . . , k.\nThe Hausdorff groupoid is\n\u0393k = {(x, y) \u2208 M \u00d7 M : \u03c0i (x) = \u03c0i (y), i = 1, . . . , k}\n=\n\n[\n\n[x] \u00d7 [x].\n\n(\u03c01 ,...,\u03c0k )(x)\u2208(\u03c01 ,...,\u03c0k )(M )\n\n8\n\n\fTherefore, the set [x] \u2208 M/\u03c1k is closed, and {[x]} = {\u03c01 , . . . , \u03c0k }(t), t \u2208\n(\u03c01 , . . . , \u03c0k )(M). It follows that \u03c1 is of measurable type. We thus can write\n(a \u2217k b)(x, y) =\n\nZ\n\n[x]\n\na(x, z)b(z, u)d\u03bc(z)\n\nfor a, b \u2208 Ak = Cf\u221ec (\u0393k ).\nStep n. We obviously have x\u03c1y \u21d4 \u03c0i (x) = \u03c0i (y), i = 1, . . . , n \u21d4 x = y,\nS\nS\nand \u0393n = x\u2208M {x} \u00d7 {x} x\u2208M {x, x} = \u2206, and [x] = {x}. Therefore,\nAn = Cf\u221ec (M) and a \u2217n b = a * b.\nSummarizing, we have the following sequence of groupoids\n\u03b90\n\n\u03b91\n\n\u03b9k\u22121\n\n\u03b9k\n\n\u03b9n\u22121\n\n\u03930 \u2283 \u03931 \u2283 . . . \u2283 \u0393k \u2283 . . . \u2283 \u0393n ,\nand the following sequence of the corresponding algebras\n\u03b9\u2217\n\n\u03b9\u2217\n\n\u03b9\u2217k\u22121\n\n\u03b9\u2217\n\n\u03b9\u2217n\u22121\n\nk\n1\n0\n. . . \u2192 An\n. . . \u2192 Ak \u2192\nA1 \u2192\nA0 \u2192\n\nwhere \u03b9\u2217s , s = 0, . . . , n, are homomorphisms of algebras. In this sense, we can\nspeak about the noncommutative deformation of the algebra An .\n\n6\n\nPosition and Momentum\n\nLet us consider the derivation P : C \u221e (M) \u2192 C \u221e (M) of the algebra\nC \u221e (M) (of course, with the pointwise multiplication). We shall also write\n(P (x)f )(x) = (P f )(x) for f \u2208 C \u221e (M). We lift the derivation P to the\nproduct M \u00d7 M in two ways:\nP\u0304hor (x, y) = (\u03b9y )\u2217x P (x)\nand\nP\u0304ver (x, y) = (\u03b9x )\u2217y P (y)\nwhere \u03b9y (x) = (x, y), \u03b9x (y) = (x, y). Clearly, P\u0304hor , P\u0304ver \u2208 Der(C \u221e (M \u00d7 M)).\nRemembering that A \u2282 C \u221e (M \u00d7 M), we make the restrictions\nP\u0304hor |A : Cc\u221e (M \u00d7 M) \u2192 Cc\u221e (M \u00d7 M),\nP\u0304ver |A : Cc\u221e (M \u00d7 M) \u2192 Cc\u221e (M \u00d7 M),\n9\n\n\fand perform the symmetrization\nP\u0304 (x, y) = P\u0304hor (x, y) + P\u0304ver (x, y).\nWe now check that P\u0304 is a generalized derivation of the convolution algebra\n\u00d7 M). First, we observe that\n\nCc\u221e (M\n\n(P\u0304 (a \u2217 b))(x, y) =\n\nZ\n\nM\n\nP\u0304 (x, y)(a(x, z) * b(z, y))d\u03bb(z).\n\nNext, we check that P\u0304 satisfies the generalized Leibniz rule, i.e.,\nP\u0304 (a \u2217 b) = P\u0304hor (a) \u2217 b + a \u2217 P\u0304ver (b).\nIn checking this we should take into account that P\u0304 decomposes into the\nhorizontal component and the vertical component in the following way\nP\u0304 (a(*, z) * b(z, *)) = P\u0304hor (a(*, z)) * b(z, *) + a(*, z) * P\u0304ver (b(z, *)).\nThus we have\n(P\u0304 (a \u2217 b))(x, y) =\n\nZ\n\nM\n\nP\u0304hor (a(x, z)) * b(z, y) + a(x, z) * P\u0304ver (b(z, y))d\u03bb(z) =\n\n= (P\u0304hor (a) \u2217 b)(x, y) + (a \u2217 P\u0304ver (b))(x, y).\nLet us notice that the algebra A = Cc\u221e (M \u00d7 M) is a Z-bimodule, where\nZ = C \u221e (\u2206), \u2206 = \u0393(0) being the diagonal of M \u00d7 M. And clearly Z is\nisomorphic with C \u221e (M). We consider the left action of Z on A, \u03b1 : Z \u00d7A \u2192\nA, defined in the following way\n\u03b1(f, a)(x, y) = f (x, x) * a(x, y)\nfor f \u2208 Z, a \u2208 A. Let us denote \u03b1(f, a) = (Q(f ))a. We have the following\ncommutation relation\n[P\u0304 , Q(f )] = Q(P f ).\nIndeed, since P\u0304 satisfies the usual Leibniz condition for pointwise multiplication we have\n[P\u0304 , Q(f )](a)(x, y) = P\u0304 (Q(f )(a))(x, y) \u2212 (Q(f )P\u0304 (a))(x, y) =\n= P\u0304 (f (x, x) * a(x, y)) \u2212 f (x, x) * P\u0304 (a(x, y)) =\n= (P f )(x, x) * a(x, y) + f (x, x) * P\u0304 (a(x, y)) \u2212 f (x, x) * P\u0304 (a(x, y)) =\n= (Q(P f )a)(x, y).\nIn the nth step of the previous section we have A = Cf\u221ec (M) and, if M = Rn ,\nwe obviously have [\u03c0i , Pi ] = 1 which means that the above equation is indeed\na generalization of the usual Heisenberg commutation relation.\n10\n\n\f7\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nAt first sight it is surprising that a simple (non-)Hausdorff property could\nhave such far-reaching consequences. However, on the second thought this\nseems to be more understandable. Lemma 1 of Sect. 2 states that the family\nof functions consistent with the Hausdorff relation on a given manifold (or on\na differential space) coincides with the differential structure of this manifold,\nand it is precisely the differential structure that fixes both topological and\ndifferential properties of the manifold. Therefore, we are here at the very\nbasis of the concept of space.\nUsually groupoids are regarded as generalizations of groups (\"groups with\nmany units\"), but they can also be regarded as generalized equivalence relations. \"From this point of view, a groupoid over B tells us not only which\nelements of B are equivalent to one another, but it also parametrizes the different ways in which two elements can be equivalent\" [10]. Alan Weinstein\ncompares the groupoid structure to that of gauge theories. In these theories\nspace-time points are equipped with internal group symmetries in such a way\nthat, when they are composed into a gauge theory, some of their irreducible\nrepresentations correspond to elementary particles. \"But gauge groups and\ngauge transformations are applicable only because all the points of space-time\nare alike\" [10]. In the case of the Hausdorff groupoid, we are also taking into\naccount \"different ways\" in which any two points are equivalent, and this\ncan be regarded as a kind of internal symmetries with which the points (and\nnot any elementary particles) are equipped. The nontrivial consequence of\nthis fact is that, after defining a convolutive algebra on a given groupoid\nand representing it on a bundle of Hilbert spaces, random properties of the\nconstruction emerge. It is interesting that in this situation counterparts of\nthe position and momentum operators can be defined, and they satisfy a\ncommutation relation which, in the suitable limiting case, reproduces the\nHeisenberg indeterminacy relation well known in quantum mechanics. It\nseems reasonable that if we loose the identity of points, the only possibility\nto predict something must be via a probabilistic kind of reasoning.\nOf course, not always a suitable groupoid is a simple Hausdorff groupoid,\nexplored in the present paper. In more advanced cases some more complex\ntypes of groupoids should be used (we have chosen to deal with the simplest\npossible case to show, as clearly as possible, arcana of its working). But the\nstrategy is always the same: when the Hausdorff property is broken down,\ngroupoid symmetries are surfacing and the noncommutative regime takes\n11\n\n\fover.\nWe should realize that the nonlocal and probabilistic character (noncommutation relation of generalized position and momentum operators included)\nare neither additional assumptions nor effects of a quantization process, but\nconclusions deduced from purely mathematical premises. It is therefore natural to propose a hypothesis that the nonlocal and probabilistic character\nof quantum mechanics are but \"hereditary\" properties which have somehow\nsurvived the \"phase transition\" from the noncommutative regime to quantum\nmechanical physics. If so, these two properties (nonlocality and probabilistic\ncharacter) must be present at the fundamental level (albeit in a generalized\nform). To be sure, this conclusion does not preclude looking for quantum\ngravity theory in various directions.\n\nReferences\n[1] Biane, Ph., Free Probability for Probabilists, arXiv:math.PR/9809193.\n[2] Bosshardt, B., On the b-Boundary of the Closed Friedmann Model,\nCommun.
