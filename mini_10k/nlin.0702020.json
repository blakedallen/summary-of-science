R. Gilson, J. J. C. Nimmo\nDepartment of Mathematics\nUniversity of Glasgow, UK\n\nAbstract\nA non-Abelian version of the Hirota-Miwa equation is considered. In an earlier paper [Nimmo\n(2006) J.

The special case of the matrix Hirota-Miwa equation is also considered using a more traditional,\nbilinear approach and the techniques are compared.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThere has been interest recently in noncommutative version of some of the well-known soliton equations\nincluding the KP and KdV equations [1\u201310]. In many cases, the noncommutative version of the equation\nis obtained by considering the compatibility of the same Lax pair that is used in the commutative case.\nThe only difference between the commutative and noncommutative cases being that the assumption that\ncoefficients in the Lax pair commute is relaxed.\nThe Hirota-Miwa equation, or discrete KP equation, [11, 12] is the fully discrete three dimensional\nintegrable system\n(a2 \u2212 a3 )\u03c4,1 \u03c4,23 + (a3 \u2212 a1 )\u03c4,2 \u03c4,31 + (a1 \u2212 a2 )\u03c4,3 \u03c4,12 = 0,\n(1)\nwhere ak are constants, \u03c4 = \u03c4 (n1 , n2 , n3 ) and subscripts ,j denote a forward shift in the corresponding\ndiscrete variable n1 , n2 or n3 . This is the compatibility conditions for the linear system\n\u03c6,i \u2212 \u03c6,j = Uij \u03c6,\nfor i < j = 1, 2, 3 where\n\n(2)\n\n\u03c4,ij \u03c4\n.\n(3)\n\u03c4,i \u03c4,j\nIf one considers the linear system (2) in a noncommutative setting, the parameterisation (3) is not\nappropriate but nonetheless we obtain a nonlinear system for the Uij which we call the non-Abelian\nHirota-Miwa equation. This system was derived in [13] and solutions in terms of quasideterminants [14]\nwere derived by means of Darboux transformations.\nIt has long been known [15] that equations in the KP hierarchy can be interpreted as Pl\u00fccker relations\non an infinite dimensional Grassmann manifold. In this paper we establish a result which hints at a\ncorresponding situation in the noncommutative case as we show that the quasideterminant solutions are,\nin the terminology of Gelfand et al [14, 16], quasi-Pl\u00fccker coordinates and the non-Abelian Hirota-Miwa\nequation is a quasi-Pl\u00fccker relation.\nThis paper is arranged as follows. In Section 2, the properties of quasideterminants that are used\nin the rest of the paper are described. In Section 3, the main results from [13] are summarised and\nthe quasideterminant solutions found there are presented. The next two sections give two contrasting\napproaches to direct verification of these solutions. In the first, applicable in the general non-Abelian\ncase, the solutions are recognised to be quasi-Pl\u00fccker coordinates and the direct verification is effected\nusing quasi-Pl\u00fccker relations and other properties. Finally, we consider an alternative approach which\nworks only for the matrix Hirota-Miwa equation. In this it is shown how standard Pl\u00fccker relations are\nused to verify the solutions.\nUij = (ai \u2212 aj )\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nPreliminaries\n\nIn this section we will state the properties of quasideterminants that are used in this article. The reader\nis referred to the original papers [14,16] for a more detailed description and proofs of the results described\nhere.\n\n2.1\n\nQuasideterminants\n\nFor an n\u00d7n matrix M = (ai,j ) over a ring R (noncommutative, in general) there are n2 quasideterminants\nwritten as |M |i,j for i, j = 1, . . . , n which are also elements of R. They are defined recursively by\n|M |i,j = ai,j \u2212 rij (M i,j )\u22121 cij ,\n\nM \u22121 = (|M |\u22121\nj,i )i,j=1,...,n .\n\n(4)\n\nrij\n\nrepresents the ith row of M with the jth element removed, cij the jth column with the\nIn the above\nith element removed and M i,j the submatrix obtained by removing the ith row and the jth column from\nA. Quasideterminants can also denoted as shown below, by boxing the entry about which the expansion\nis made\nM i,j\ncij\n|M |i,j =\n.\nj\nai,j\nri\nIn the case n =\u00121, let \u0013\nM = (a), say, and then there is just one quasideterminant |M |1,1 = | a | = a.\na b\nFor n = 2, if M =\n, then there are four quasideterminants\nc d\n|M |1,1 =\n\na\nc\n\nb\n= a \u2212 bd\u22121 c,\nd\n\n|M |1,2 =\n\na\nc\n\nb\n= b \u2212 ac\u22121 d,\nd\n\n|M |2,1 =\n\na\nc\n\nb\n= c \u2212 db\u22121 a,\nd\n\n|M |2,2 =\n\na\nc\n\nb\n= d \u2212 ca\u22121 b.\nd\n\nFrom this we can obtain the matrix inverse,\n\u0012\n(a \u2212 bd\u22121 c)\u22121\n\u22121\nM =\n(b \u2212 ac\u22121 d)\u22121\n\n\u0013\n(c \u2212 db\u22121 a)\u22121\n,\n(d \u2212 ca\u22121 b)\u22121\n\nwhich is then used in the definition of the 9 quasideterminants of a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix.\nTo explain results in the simplest way, we will sometimes write M as a block matrix\n\u0012\n\u0013\nA B\nM=\nC d\nwhere d \u2208 R, A is a square matrix over R of arbitrary size and B, C are column and row vectors over\nR of compatible lengths. For this matrix,\nA\nC\n\n2.2\n\nB\n= d \u2212 CA\u22121 B.\nd\n\n(5)\n\nCommutative cases\n\nIf the entries in M commute then the above becomes the familiar formula for the inverse of a 2 \u00d7 2\nmatrix with entries expressed as ratios of determinants. Indeed this is true in general; if the entries in\nM commute then\nM i,j cij\nrij\nai,j\n|M |\n|M |i,j =\n= (\u22121)i+j\n,\n(6)\n|M i,j |\n|M i,j |\nthe alternating sign arising from the reordering of rows and columns in the numerator.\nIn the special case that the ring R is the (noncommutative) ring of N \u00d7 N matrices over another\ncommutative ring, the (i, j)-quasideterminant of M , |M |i,j is itself an N \u00d7 N matrix with (k, l)th entry\n(|M |i,j )k,l =\n\nM i,j\n(rij )lk\n2\n\n(cij )kl\n.\n(ai,j )k,l\n\n(7)\n\n\f2.3\n\nInvariance under row and column operations\n\nThe quasideterminants of a matrix have invariance properties similar to those of determinants under\nelementary row and column operations applied to the matrix. Consider the following quasideterminant\nof an n \u00d7 n matrix;\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\nE 0\nA B\nA B\nEA\nEB\n.\n(8)\n= g(d \u2212 CA\u22121 B) = g\n=\nF g\nC d n,n\nC d n,n\nF A + gC F B + gd n,n\nThis formula describes the effect on the quasideterminants of a matrix of performing elementary row\noperations, involving left multiplication, on the matrix. The zero block in the first matrix means that\noperations which add left-multiples of the row containing the expansion point to other rows are excluded\nfrom consideration, but all other elementary row operations are included. We see that left-multiplying\nthe row containing the expansion point by g has the effect of left-multiplying the quasideterminant by\ng and that all other operations leave the quasideterminant unchanged. There is analogous invariance\nunder column operations involving multiplication on the right.\n\n2.4\n\nNoncommutative Jacobi Identity\n\nThere is a quasideterminant version of Jacobi's identity for determinants, called the noncommutative\nSylvester's Theorem by Gelfand and Retakh [16]. The simplest version of this identity is given by\nA\nD\nE\n\n2.5\n\nB\nf\nh\n\nC\nA\ng =\nE\ni\n\nA\nC\n\u2212\ni\nE\n\nB\nh\n\nA\nD\n\nB\nf\n\n\u22121\n\nA\nD\n\nC\ng .\n\n(9)\n\nQuasi-Pl\u00fccker coordinates\n\nGiven an (n + k) \u00d7 n matrix A, denote the ith row of A by Ai , the submatrix of A having rows with\nindices in a subset I of {1, 2, . . . , n + k} by AI and A{1,...,n+k}\\{i} by A\u0131\u0302 . Given i, j \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n + k}\nand I such that #I = n \u2212 1 and j \u2208\n/ I, one defines the (right) quasi-Pl\u00fccker coordinates\nI\nI\nrij\n= rij\n(A) :=\n\nAI\nAi\n\nAI\nAj\n\nns\n\n\u22121\nns\n\nAI\n= \u2212 Ai\nAj\n\n0\n0 ,\n1\n\n(10)\n\nfor any column index s \u2208 {1, . . . , n}. The final equality in (10) comes from an identity of the form (9)\nand proves that the definition is independent of the choice of s.\nThe following are easy consequence of the definition:\nI\nrij\n=0\nI\nrii\nI\nrji\nI I\nrij\nrjk\n\nif i \u2208 I, (and is not defined if j were in I)\n\n=1\n=\n=\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\n\u0001\nI \u22121\nrij\nI\n.\nrik\n\n(13)\n(14)\n\nRemark. A useful consequence of (10) and (13) is the identity\nAI\nAi\nAj\n\n0\n0\n1\n\n\u22121\n\nAI\n= Ai\nAj\n\n0\n1 ,\n0\n\n(15)\n\nwhich shows that quasideterminants of this form may be inverted very simply.\nThere are also the following properties which are proved in [16]: skew-symmetry\nI\\{i,j} I\\{j,k}\nrjk\n\nrij\n\nI\\{i,k}\n\n= \u2212rik\n\n,\n\nfor any {i, j, k} \u2208 I and quasi-Pl\u00fccker relations\nX L\\{j}\nM\nrji\n= 1,\nrij\nj\u2208L\n\nfor any i \u2208\n/ M , where L, M \u2282 {1, . . . , n + k} such that #L \u2212 1 = #M = n \u2212 1.\n3\n\n(16)\n\n(17)\n\n\f3\n\nA non-Abelian Hirota-Miwa equation\n\nThis section is mainly a review of the results found in [13]. When discussing lattice equations one\ngenerally thinks of the dependent variable as a real or complex valued function of one or more integervalued variables. Here we wish to abstract this notion as far as possible and think of a lattice in a more\ngeneral way which encompasses the usual types of lattice systems. Similar ideas were also explored by\nMatveev in [17]. We suppose that dependent variables take values in a ring R and the lattice is defined\nby means of mappings si : R \u2192 R, i \u2208 N, which we think of as moving between neighbouring sites on\nthe (possibly infinite dimensional) lattice. The particular examples we have in mind for these mappings\ninclude the usual shift operators si (\u03c6(ni )) = \u03c6(ni + 1) or q-shift operators si (\u03c6(ni )) = \u03c6(qi ni ), but\nalso Darboux or B\u00e4cklund transformations si (\u03c6) = \u03c6e mapping between different solutions of the lattice\nequations.\nWith these sorts of examples in mind, we require that the si have the following properties:\n1. all si are invertible and mutually commute, so that motion on the lattice is reversible and path\nindependent\n2. each si is a linear homomorphism so that the same (linear and nonlinear) relations satisfied at one\nlattice site are satisfied at all lattice sites,\nand we refer to such mappings as lattice operators. We will also use the shorthand notation X,i = si (X)\nand X,\u0131 = s\u22121\ni (X).\nNow consider lattice operators si , (i \u2208 N), and invertible Uij \u2208 R and the system of linear equations\nfor \u03c6\n\u03c6,i \u2212 \u03c6,j + Uij \u03c6 := si (\u03c6) \u2212 sj (\u03c6) + Uij \u03c6 = 0, (i, j \u2208 N).\n(18)\nThis system is algebraically over-determined and so for any i, j, k,\nUij + Ujk + Uki = 0.\n\n(19)\n\nThis includes degenerate cases which arise when some of i, j, k coincide, namely Uii = 0 and Uij +Uji = 0.\nThe compatibility conditions \u03c6,ij = \u03c6,ji give the nonlinear conditions\nUij,k Uik = Uik,j Uij\n\n(20)\n\nfor i, j, k distinct (if any of i, j, k coincide this is a empty condition) together with\nUij,k + Ujk,i + Uki,j = 0.\n\n(21)\n\nBy introducing Vij = Uij,\u0131 \uf6be , one may rewrite (21) as the \"dual\" equation\nVij + Vjk + Vki = 0,\n\n(22)\n\nand one may also rewrite (20) in terms of Vij as\nVij Vik,\uf6be\u0304 = Vik Vij,k\u0304 .\n\n(23)\n\nIt is straightforward to show that the Uij satisfy (19) and (20) if and only if the Vij satisfy (22) and\n(23) and so it suffices to consider either the equations for Uij\nUij + Ujk + Uki = 0,\n\nUij,k Uik = Uik,j Uij ,\n\n(24)\n\nVij + Vjk + Vki = 0,\n\nVik Vij,k\u0304 = Vij Vik,\uf6be\u0304 .\n\n(25)\n\nor for Vij\nWe call either of these equivalent systems the nonabelian Hirota-Miwa equation.\nIf we fix on one particular three dimensional sublattice (defined by s1 , s2 , s3 say), the linear equations\n\u03c6,i \u2212 \u03c6,j + Uij \u03c6 = 0,\n\n(i, j \u2208 {1, 2, 3})\n\n(26)\n\nare compatible provided (24) or (25) are satisfied for {i, j, k} \u2282 {1, 2, 3}. The remaining dimensions in\nthe lattice defined by s4 , s5 , * * * = d1 , d2 , . . . can be interpreted as Darboux transformations. In [13] these\n4\n\n\fDarboux transformations were exploited in order to construct solutions of the non-Abelian Hirota-Miwa\nsystem expressed in terms of quasideterminants. Finally in the section, we will state these results.\nMaking the ansatz\nUij = Xi,j aij Xi\u22121 ,\n(27)\nwhere Xi \u2208 R are invertible and aij \u2208 R, the nonlinear conditions (20) are satisfied for any Xi provided\nthe aij themselves satisfy this condition. We also take aii = 0 so that Uii = 0. With these choices, (23)\nare solved by writing\nVij = Yi\u22121 aij Yi,\uf6be\u0304 ,\n(28)\n\u22121\n. In the commutative case, the skew-symmetry conditions\nwhere Yi = Xi,\u0131\u0304\n\n0 = Uij + Uji = Xi,j aij Xi\u22121 + Xj,i aji Xj\u22121 = aij\n\nXi,j\nXj,i\n+ aji\n,\nXi\nXj\n\ncan be solved identically by the additional ansatz Xi = \u03c4,i /\u03c4 and taking aij + aji = 0. The remaining\nequation in (24) now becomes the standard Hirota-Miwa equation (1) and it is for this reason that we\nrefer to (24) and (25) as non-Abelian Hirota-Miwa equations.\nNow let Xi , i = 1, 2, 3, and aij i, j \u2208 {1, 2, 3} construct, through (27), a vacuum solution Uij of\n(26). For example, one could choose X1 = X2 = X3 = 1 and aij = \u03b1i \u2212 \u03b1j . Now choose n vacuum\neigenfunctions, \u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8n i.e. solutions of (26) with the vacuum choice for Uij made above. From these\none may construct the row vector \u03b8 = (\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8n ) satisfying\nsi (\u03b8) \u2212 sj (\u03b8) + Uij \u03b8 = 0.\n\n(29)\n\ne \u22121\neij = X\nei,j aij X\nThen, after n applications of Darboux transformations, the solution obtained is U\ni\nwhere [13]\n\u03b8\n1\nsi (\u03b8)\n0\n..\n..\nei =\nX\n(30)\n.\n. Xi .\nsin\u22121 (\u03b8)\nsni (\u03b8)\n\n4\n\n0\n0\n\nDirect verification of solutions using quasideterminants\n\nIn this section we use the properties of quasideterminants stated in \u00a72 to effect a direct verification of the\nsolutions described in (30). By recognising that the quasideterminant in this equation is a quasi-Pl\u00fccker\ncoordinate (10), it may immediately be inverted using (15) to obtain\n\ne \u22121 = X \u22121\nX\ni\ni\n\n\u03b8\nsi (\u03b8)\n..\n.\nsin\u22121 (\u03b8)\nsni (\u03b8)\n\n0\n0\n.. .\n.\n\n(31)\n\n0\n1\n\nThen, use the linear equation (29) and the invariance properties (8), we get\n\neij =\nU\n\nsj (\u03b8)\nsj (si (\u03b8))\n..\n.\nsj (sin\u22121 (\u03b8))\nsj (sni (\u03b8))\n\n1\n0\n..\n.\n\nsj (\u03b8)\nsi (\u03b8)\n..\n.\n\n0\n0\n\nsin\u22121 (\u03b8)\nsni (\u03b8)\n\n0\n0\n.. ,\n.\n0\n1\n\ns\u22121\ni (\u03b8)\n\u03b8\n..\ne\nVij =\n.\nsin\u22122 (\u03b8)\nsin\u22121 (\u03b8)\n\n1\n0\n..\n.\n0\n0\n\ns\u22121\ni (\u03b8)\ns\u22121\nj (\u03b8)\n\u03b8\n..\n.\n\n0\n0\n0\n.. .\n.\n\nsin\u22123 (\u03b8)\nsin\u22122 (\u03b8)\n\n0\n1\n\n(32)\n\nIn fact, this is the first key step in the direct verification, we can go one step further with Veij . By\nmaking use of (29) and (8) we may write all but three rows of the quasideterminants in a way which is\n5\n\n\findependent of the particular choices of i and j. Let X (m) denote sm\nk (X) for any choice of k = 1, 2 or 3.\nThen it is straightforward to verify using (29) and (8) that\n\nVeij =\n\n\u03b8,\u0131\u0304\n\u03b8\n..\n.\n\n1\n0\n..\n.\n\n\u03b8(n\u22123)\n\u03b8(n\u22122)\n\u03b8(n\u22121)\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n.. .\n.\n\n\u03b8,\u0131\u0304\n\u03b8,\uf6be\u0304\n\u03b8\n..\n.\n\u03b8(n\u22123)\n\u03b8(n\u22122)\n\n(33)\n\n0\n1\n\nTo complete the direct verification of these solutions we must show that they satisfy\nVii = 0,\n\nVij + Vji = 0,\n\nVij + Vjk + Vki = 0.\n\n(34)\n\nOne consequence of (8) is that a quasideterminant in which the row containing the expansion point\nis the same as another row is zero. The second factor in Veii is such a quasideterminant and so Veii = 0.\nNext define the (n + 3) \u00d7 n matrix\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u03b8,1\n\uf8ef \u03b8,2 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef \u03b8,3 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef (n\u22122) \uf8fa\n\uf8ef\u03b8\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\u03b8(n\u22121) \uf8fa\n\u0398=\uf8ef\n\uf8fa,\n\uf8ef \u03b8 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef \u03b8(1) \uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef . \uf8fa\n\uf8f0 .. \uf8fb\n\u03b8(n\u22123)\n\nwhich will play the role of the matrix A in the definition of quasi-Pl\u00fccker coordinates (10), and let\nI = {6, . . . , n + 3} so that\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u03b8\n\uf8ef \u03b8(1) \uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\u0398I = \uf8ef . \uf8fa .\n\uf8f0 .. \uf8fb\n\u03b8(n\u22123)\nThen the quasideterminants appearing in (33) can be expressed as quasi-Pl\u00fccker coordinates,\n\u03b8\n..\n.\nI\u222a{4}\n\nr5,i\n\n\u03b8\n..\n.\n\n0\n..\n.\n\n(n\u22123)\n(\u0398) = \u2212 \u03b8\n(n\u22122)\n\u03b8\n\u03b8(n\u22121)\n\u03b8\u0131\u0304\n\n0 ,\n0\n0\n1\n\nI\u222a{j}\n\nri,4\n\n(n\u22123)\n(\u0398) = \u2212 \u03b8\n\u03b8\uf6be\u0304\n\u03b8\u0131\u0304\n\u03b8(n\u22122)\n\n0\n..\n.\n0 .\n0\n0\n1\n\nHence,\nI\u222a{4} I\u222a{j}\nVeij = r5,i ri,4 ,\n\n(35)\n\nwhere here and from now on we omit reference to the matrix \u0398.

This involves expressing the matrix entries as ratios of determinants, reexpressing the system\n(25) in bilinear form and verifying the solutions using identities arising from Laplace expansions. In\nthis section, we will contrast this more familiar, bilinear approach with the direct verification using\nquasideterminants described in the last section. We will see that the proof a similar sequence of steps\nbut, in contrast with the proof involving quasideterminants, has a rather ad hoc feel to it, in which the\ndetails of the calculation such as keeping track of the correct power of \u22121, are rather intricate.\nIn the case that we seek solutions Vij of (25) has solutions in this matrix ring, the ingredients in\nthe solutions (33), the elements \u03b8k are themselves also (invertible) r \u00d7 r matrices and the concatenation\nof these, \u03b8 is a r \u00d7 rn matrix. This expression for the solutions (33) as quasideterminants can then be\nreexpressed in terms of a product of matrices whose entries are ratios of n \u00d7 n determinants,\nVij =\n\nGi hij\n,\nFi Fj\n\n(39)\n\nwhere for each i, j, Fi is scalar and Gi and hij are r \u00d7 r matrices. For a more compact notation, allowing\ndeterminants to be expressed in terms of columns rather than rows, \u03b8 is replaced by its transpose so that\nnow \u03b8 is a rn \u00d7 r matrix. The specific expressions are\nFi = s\u22121\ni (\u03b8)\n\n\u03b8(1)\n\n\u03b8\n\n***\n\n\u03b8(n\u22122) ,\n\n(40)\n\nand the (p, q)th entries of Gi and hij are\n(Gi )pq = (\u22121)rn+1+q s\u22121\ni (\u03b8)q\u0302\n\n\u03b8\n\n\u03b8(1)\n\ns\u22121\nj (\u03b8)\n\n\u03b8\n\n,\n\n(41)\n\n(n\u22122)\n\n,\n\n(42)\n\n\u03b8(n\u22122)\n\n\u03b8p\n\n***\n\n\u03b8(n\u22123)\n\n\u03b8q\u0302\n\nand\n(hij )pq = (\u22121)r+q s\u22121\ni (\u03b8)p\n\n(n\u22121)\n\n***\n\nrespectively, where \u03b8p denotes the pth column of \u03b8 and \u03b8q\u0302 means all the columns of \u03b8 except the q th .\nIf Vij is to satisfy (34) then we must show that\nhii = 0,\n\nGi hij + Gj hji = 0,\n\nGi hij Fk + Gj hjk Fi + Gk hki Fj = 0.\n\n(43)\n\nThe first of these is obvious since if j = i then two columns in hii are the same.

In the first approach, the solutions are expressed in\nterms of quasi-Pl\u00fccker coordinates and the verification is achieved by using properties of these objects,\nincluding quasi-Pl\u00fccker relations. The second approach, available only in the matrix case and not\ninvolving quasideterminants, uses an expression for the solutions as matrix of ratios of determinants. In\nthe first approach, the machinery used is more sophisticated but the verification is quite straightforward\nand applicable whatever the nature of the non-Abelian equation, matrix or quaternion or otherwise. The\nsecond verification needs less sophisticated tools (transformation to a bilinear form and standard Pl\u00fccker\nrelations) and is not always available since determinants are not defined in the general non-Abelian case.\nA direct quasideterminant approach has also been applied to noncommutative versions of the KP and\nmKP equations [10, 18] and it is hoped that this can be developed into a more widely applied direct\napproach to noncommutative integrable systems.\n8\n\n\fReferences\n[1] Kupershmidt, B.
