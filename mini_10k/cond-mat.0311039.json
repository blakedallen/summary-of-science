The conduction electrons transfer angular momentum to the Bloch wall with\n100% efficiency in the absence of pinning. The wall is displaced without distortion with velocity\nproportional to the current. In the presence of a pinning potential either the angular momentum\nis destroyed by the perpendicular component of the anisotropy field or is converted to coherent\nmagnons. A moving wall has its velocity reduced by pinning. The expression for the velocity agrees\nsurprisingly well with experiment.\nPACS numbers: 75.60.-d, 73.40.Cg, 73.50.Bk, 75.70.i\n\nSpintronic devices have great technological promise\nbut represent a challenging problem at both an applied\nand fundamental level. It has been shown theoretically[1,\n2] that the direction of a magnetic domain might be\nswitched using currents alone. Devices designed to use\nthis principle often consist of multilayers of magnetic and\nnon-magnetic materials. The advantages of similar devices based upon the current induced displacement of\nBloch wall are simplicity and the fact that the switching current is smaller[3\u20135]. Experimentally the current\ninduced displacement of a Bloch wall has been clearly\ndemonstrated and in a recent experiment the velocity of\nthe displaced wall was measured[5].\nIn this Letter is developed a first principles theory for\nthe coupling between a current and a Bloch wall based\nupon a standard model for ferromagnets, i.e., within the\ndouble exchange model. Great care is taken in order\nto ensure that angular momentum is conserved. Using\nthe s \u2212 d-exchange model, Berger[2] shows the polarization of the s-electrons rotates as it passes through a wall.\nThe reaction force might then be assumed to cause wall\nmovement. However, as will be shown, the situation is\ncomplicated. Angular momentum given to the wall can\nbe taken up either by (i) the displacement of the wall, (ii)\nthe production of coherent spin waves or (iii) a rotation\nof the wall so that the angular momentum is absorbed\nby the anisotropy energy. These issues are most easily addressed in the half-metal limit. This is technologically pertinent since it corresponds to the most efficient\ndevices. Most work has been performed on Permalloy\n(Ni81 Fe19 ). For this material, the current ~j has a polarization p \u2248 0.7[5] and so the present description based\nupon p = 1 is not hopelessly unrealistic. When making comparison with experiment, the difference will be\naccounted for by adding factors of p as appropriate.\nThe standard double exchange model is\n\u0011\nX\nX \u0010 \u2020\nni\u2191 ni\u2193\nci\u03c3 cj\u03c3 + H.c. + U\nH = \u2212t\n<ij>\u03c3\n\ni\n\nX\nX\n~i * S\n~j (1)\n~i * ~si + ASiz 2 \u2212 K\u22a5 Siy 2 ) \u2212 J0\nS\n(JH S\n\u2212\ni\n\n<ij>\n\n~i is the localized spin operator and c\u2020 creates\nwhere S\ni\u03c3\nan electron with spin \u03c3 at site i. The wire is assumed\nto extend along the z-direction. That this an easy axis\nimplies A > 0.\nCorresponding to highly correlated electrons, the limit\nU \u226b t is taken. This permits a spinless majority electron\noperator c\u2020i \u2261 c\u2020i\u2191 to be defined, and in terms of this the\n\n\u2020\n\u2212\nminority c\u2020i\u2193 = s\u2212\ni ci where si is the conduction electron\nspin operator. A large Hund's rule coupling |JH | \u226b t is\nalso assumed. With this only the largest total angular\nmomentum manifold is relevant. At a site occupied by a\nconduction electron only states with J = S + 1/2 need to\n~i /(2S). This\nbe accounted for and it follows that ~si \u2248 S\nis not an assumption about local equilibrium of the conduction electron but rather is an immediate and rigorous\nconsequence of the Wigner-Eckart theorem.\n\nThe Holstein-Primakoff transformation[6] Siz = S \u2212\nb\u2020i bi , Si+ = (2S \u2212 b\u2020i bi )1/2 bi \u2248 (2S)1/2 bi is used to quantize the spin degrees of freedom. In principle, the axes of\nquantization are arbitrary, however , as the standard theory of ferromagnetic magnons illustrates, in fact the local axis of quantization must be taken along the classical\nequilibrium direction, i.e., the spin direction in the limit\nS \u2192 \u221e. When this is the case the approach generates\nand expansion in 1/S. This local equilibrium direction is\nspecified by the Euler angles \u03b8i and \u03c6i . In this Letter the\nsolution will most often be time dependent. Rather than\nsetting up the complicated equations of motion, here extensive use will be made of rotating frames. The aim is\nto reduce the problem to that of static equilibrium but\nwithin the time dependent frame. The time dependent\nsolution is then obtained upon reverting to the laboratory frame.\nIn the absence of a wall,\nkinetic\nP for large U\u2020, the\n+\nenergy term is T\u0302 = \u2212t hiji (c\u2020i cj + s\u2212\ni ci cj sj ) + H.c.\nThe Bloch wall is generated through via the static rotations by \u03b8, and \u03c6. For this large U regime, the usual\nSU(2) rotation of the conduction electron operators sim\u2020\nplifies to c\u2020i \u2192 (cos[\u03b8/2] + sin[\u03b8/2] s\u2212\ni )ci and the roP\n\u2020\n\u2020\n+\ntated T\u0302 \u2248 \u2212t hiji cos[(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j )/2](ci cj + s\u2212\ni ci cj sj ) \u2212\n\n\f2\n\u2020\n\u2020\n+\nsin[(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j )/2](s\u2212\ni ci cj \u2212 ci cj sj ) + H.c. Charge\nP\nmotion arises principally via Ht = \u2212t hiji tij c\u2020i cj + H.c.\nwhere tij = t cos[(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j )/2]. The reduction of tij in the\nBloch wall implies a barrier, however this has a height\n\u223c SA which is taken to be negligible compared to EF .\nThe solutions of Ht are, to a good approximation, plain\n~k-states independent of the wall position or its motion.\nUsing the Wigner-Eckart theorem, the part of T\u0302 linear\nin s\u00b1\ni reduces to:\n\nit\n\nP\n\nhiji\n\nHtJ = \u2212\n\n\u2202\u03b8i X \u2020\nt\nci ci+1 (bi \u2212 b\u2020i+1 ) + H.c., (2)\na\n1/2\n\u2202z\n2(2S)\ni\n\nwhich is the key spin-charge current interaction. The, bilinear in s\u00b1\ni , part of T\u0302 is also of importance. When acting on eigenstates of Ht these lead to a renormalization,\nJ = J0 + (x\u2032 t/2S 2), of the total exchange\nP coupling J.\nThe effective concentration x\u2032 = (1/N ) ~k (cos kz a) n~k ,\nassuming isotopic hopping.\nA small wall translation by \u2206z amounts\nto a\nQ\nexp(i(\u03b8\nsmall rotation generated by R(\u2206z) =\ni \u2212\ni\nP\n\u03b8i+1 )(\u2206z/a)Siy ) \u2248 (1 + (1/2) i (\u2202\u03b8i /\u2202z)\u2206z(2S)1/2(b\u2020i \u2212\nbi )) \u2261 1 + S 1/2 (2A/J)1/4 (\u2206z/a)(b\u2020w \u2212 bw ) which defines\nP\nb\u2020w = (J/8A)1/4 i (\u2202\u03b8i /\u2202z)ab\u2020i . That the translation\nR(\u2206z) leaves the energy unchanged implies that b\u2020w creates a zero energy excitation localized in the wall. This\nspecial b\u2020w -mode is key to a understanding of not only\nthe dynamics but also pinned static solutions of a Bloch\nwall. It is of the nature of a discrete Goldstone boson\nassociated with the translational invariance of the wall.\nThe effective, H \u2248 E{\u03b8i , \u03c6i } + Ht + Hs + HtJ ,\nwhere E{\u03b8i , \u03c6i } is the classical energy functional, Ht is\ngiven above and Hs is the magnon Hamiltonian. The\nBloch wall structure can be determined by minimizing\nE{\u03b8i , \u03c6i }. The standard result is \u03b8(z) = 2 cot\u22121 e\u2212(z/w)\n\u0001\nJ 1/2\nwith \u03c6i = 0 for K\u22a5 > 0. The wall width w = a 2A\n.\nThe local axes change from \u03b8 = 0 to \u03b8 = \u03c0 with increasing z and the wall lies in the x \u2212 z-plane.\nThe conservation of the spin angular momentum Jz\nis a central issue. If the coupling to the contacts is ignored and K\u22a5 = 0, it follows that [Jz , H] = 0. A wall\nwith speed v implies J \u0307z = ~Sv/a and, in fact this must\nR\n~ where ~s is the\nbe equal to the surface integral ~s * dA\nspin current. The conduction electrons have\nR their spin\n~ \u221d I,\nreversed in the wall implying a contribution ~s * dA\nthe charge current. Such a finite surface term gives rise\nto a local term \u2207 * ~s \u221d j, the charge current density, in\n~i /dt and will lead to wall motion even\nthe equation for dS\nwhen K\u22a5 = 0.\nWhatever the value of K\u22a5 , the translational invariance of the Hamiltonian implies that the wall will move\nwith a constant velocity in the presence of a charge current. In order to prove this, use is made of a rotating\nframe. Consider again the current carrying states which\nare eigenstates of n\u0302~k = c~\u2020 c~k . The spin-charge coupling\nk\n\nreduces to\nHtJ = \u2212i\n\n~ja2 X \u2202\u03b8i\na(2S)1/2 (bi \u2212 b\u2020i ).\n2eS i \u2202z\n\n(3)\n\nl\nHere (2S)1/2 (1/2i)(bi \u2212 b\u2020i ) \u2248 Siy\ndefined to be strictly\nperpendicular to the instantaneous axis of quantization.\nThe only derivative which is finite during this short pe2 P\n\u2202\u03b8i\nl\nriod is the similar instantaneous \u1e60ix\n= S ~ja\ni \u2202z a.\n2eS\nThis derivative can also be made to be zero by a suitable\nl\nrotating frame, i.e., via r = exp(i(\u2202\u03b8i /\u2202t)Siy\nt) so that\nl\nl \u22121\nl\nl\nl\nl\nSix \u2192 rSix r\nand \u1e60ix \u2192 \u1e60ix + i(\u2202\u03b8i /\u2202t)[Siy\n, Six\n] =\n\u1e60ix \u2212 i(\u2202\u03b8i /\u2202t)S. The wall is therefore stationary, when\nthe local axes of quantization rotate according to\n\n\u2202\u03b8i\n\u2202\u03b8i\n= v0\n;\n\u2202t\n\u2202z\n\nv0 =\n\nja3\n.\n2eS\n\n(4)\n\nThe solution of this is \u03b8i \u2261 \u03b8i (z \u2212 v0 t) where \u03b8i (z) =\n2 cot\u22121 e\u2212(z/w) is the static solution. In the laboratory\nframe, the wall is translated without distortion. The velocity v0 [5, 7] is such that the net conduction electron\nspin current which enters the wall is exactly compensated\nby the similar current implied by its uniform displacement.\nThe simplest model for the pinning of the Bloch wall\nis to reduce by a small amount the anisotropy energy at\nthe origin. The added term Hp = +\u03b4AS0z 2 generates\na pinning gap Ep . The problem of such a pinned wall\nis surprisingly complicated. Our results developed below\nshow, for finite K\u22a5 , the wall tilts by an angle \u03c6 and the\ncritical charge current jc is determined by the condition\nthat Ep = 0. However, when K\u22a5 is negligible, the wall\ngenerates magnons which take away the conduction electron angular momentum given to the wall. In this case,\njc is found to reflect the equality of the rate of creation\nof linear magnon momentum to the maximum force generated by the pinning.\nThe largest pinning gap Ep arises when the wall is centered at the origin, i.e., with \u03b80 = \u03c0/2. Explicitly then,\nS0z \u2192 S0x and the diagonal part of Hp = 2S\u03b4Ab\u20200 b0 . The\nvalue of Ep is determined by evaluating the commutator\n[[Hp , bw ], b\u2020w ], which is equivalent to taking the expectation value with respect to the b\u2020w -magnon wave function,\nand, with j = 0, gives,\nEp = S\n\n\u0012\n\n2A\nJ\n\n\u00131/2\n\n\u03b4A.\n\n(5)\n\nTheP\nwall can now tilt so that \u03c6 is finite. The anisotropy\nK\u22a5 i Siy 2 contains \u22123SK\u22a5 sin2 \u03b8i sin2 \u03c6i b\u2020i bi which\ngives the bw -mode an energy shift of \u22122SK\u22a5 sin2 \u03c6. The\nmaximum allowed value of \u03c6 therefore corresponds to\n1/2\nEp = S (2A/J) \u03b4A \u2212 2SK\u22a5 sin2 \u03c6 = 0. P\nThis is related\nto the current through the terms in K\u22a5 i Siy 2 which\nare linear in bi and b\u2020i . These are imaginary and can be\n\n\f3\nwritten as \u2212i(J/2A)1/4 K\u22a5 (sin 2\u03c6)(b\u2020w \u2212bw ). This cancels\nHtJ if (~ja2 /2eS) = (S/2) (J/2A)1/2 K\u22a5 sin 2\u03c6 whence\neliminating \u03c6, assuming this is small, gives a critical current\n\u0012 \u00131/4 r\n2eS 2 J\nK\u22a5 \u03b4A\n.\n(6)\njc1 =\n~a2 2A\n2\nIf K\u22a5 is small there is an intrinsic maximum current,\n1/2\njr = (eS 2 /~a2 ) (J/2A) K\u22a5 , for \u03c6 = \u03c0/4, which will\nbe reached before Ep = 0. It follows for large \u03b4A that\njr < jc1 and K\u22a5 is negligible. In order to conserve angular momentum, the wall must now produce magnons,\ni.e., be time dependent. Sought again are current carrying eigenstates. To the j = 0 wall is added a twist characterized by k(z) \u2261 \u2202\u03c6/\u2202z and the solution is rendered\nstationary by a rotation of angular frequency \u03c9 about the\nnew axes \u03b8i and \u03c6i . The final axes of quantization then\ncorrespond to \u0398i = \u03b8i +\u03b2i and \u03c6i . The effect of such a rotation is to add an effective magnetic field ~\u03c9/g\u03bcB which\nhas an component sin \u03b2i ~\u03c9/g\u03bcB perpendicular to the \u0398i ,\n\u03c6i axis. The twist of the bond i \u2192Pi + 1 by (\u2202\u03c6i /\u2202z)a\nis introduced by Ri,i+1 \u2261 ei(\u2202\u03c6i /\u2202z)a i\u2032 \u2265i+1 Si\u2032 z . Equilibrium, in the rotating frame, implies zero coefficients of\nboth b\u2020i and bi . The easiest fashion by which to establish\nl\nthese equilibrium conditions is to observe the local Six\n=\n\u2020\n\u2020\n1/2\nl\n1/2\n(2S) (1/2)(bi + bi ) while Siy = (2S) (1/2i)(bi \u2212 bi ).\nl\n\nGiven that, e.g., Ry = eiSiy \u03b4\u03b8 rotates the ith spin by a\nl\nsmall \u03b4\u03b8 it is easy to show by evaluating [Siy\n, H] that the\nl\ncoefficient of Six in H must be (1/2S)(\u2202E/\u2202\u03b8i ) where\nE{\u03b8i , \u03c6i } is the already defined classical\nenergy. The\nP\nexchange part of this is EJ = \u2212J i [cos \u0398i cos \u0398i+1 +\nsin \u0398i sin \u0398i+1 (cos \u03c6i cos \u03c6i+1 + sin \u03c6i sin \u03c6i+1 )]. A small\nrotation by \u03b4\u03c6 is generated rather by Rz = eiSiz \u03b4\u03c6\nl\nl\nl\nwhere Siz = cos \u03b8i Siz\n+ sin \u03b8i Six\n. However [Siz\n, H]\ncontains no c-numbers and so this rotation determines\nl\nthe coefficient of Siy\n, i.e., this is (1/2S sin \u03b8i )(\u2202E/\u2202\u03c6i ).\nl\nThat the coefficient of Six\nbe zero implies [AS sin 2\u0398i +\n2 2\n2\nJSa (\u2202 \u0398i /\u2202z ) + (JSa2 )(\u2202\u03c6i /\u2202z)2 sin 2\u0398i + ~\u03c9 sin \u03b2i ]\n= 0. This can be re-integrated by \u0398i to give back the\nenergy to within a constant, i.e., it is implied that:\n[(AS +\n\nJSa2\nk(z)2 ) sin2 \u0398i + (1/2)JSa2 (\u2202\u0398i /\u2202z)2\n2\n\u2212~\u03c9(cos \u03b2i \u2212 1)] = 0.\n(7)\n\nl\nUsing \u2202EJ /\u2202\u03c6 for the coefficient of Siy\nis obtained\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2202\u0398i JSa2\n2\n\u22121 \u2202\n(sin \u0398i )\n+\nk(z) sin \u0398i = 0.\n\u2202z\n2\n\u2202z\nIntegrating this with respect to z results in an equation\nrelating currents:\n(JSa)k(z) sin2 \u0398i +\n\n~ja2\n~ja2\ncos \u0398i =\neS\neS\n\n(8)\n\nand gives\nk(z) =\n\n1\n2(JSa) cos2\n\n\u0398i\n2\n\n~ja2\neS\n\n(9)\n\nwhich, with Eqn. (7), gives an equation for \u0398i . However, except to the extreme right of the wall, \u0398i \u2248 \u03b8i\nand Eqn. (7) gives directly \u03b2i while Eqn. (9) determines\nthe twist k(z). For the extreme right Eqn. (9) reduces\nto (JSa)ks \u03b2i 2 = (~ja2 /eS) which equates spin currents\nand ultimately determines amplitude \u03b2i of the magnons\nleaving the system to the right, while Eqn. (7) reduces\nto ~\u03c9 = 2AS + JSa2 ks 2 which, correctly, equates the\nfrequency of the rotating frame to the magnon energy.\nThe whole solution is then parameterized by the value\nof ks . This, in turn, is determined by requiring that the\nabsolute value of the ground state energy be a minimum.\nGiven that the system is large compared to the width\nof the wall, the energy to be minimized it that of the\ncoherent magnons to the right of the wall. The result\nis ks a = (2A/J)1/2 which corresponds a magnon energy\nper unit site of er = (2A/J)1/2 (~ja2 /e).\nA relationship between er and the force on the wall\nis obtained by considering a wall displacement \u2206z generated by R(\u2206z) = 1 + S 1/2 (2A/J)1/4 (\u2206z/a)(b\u2020w \u2212\nbw ).\nFor the displaced wall HR|0i = [E0 +\ner (\u2206z/a)]R|0i, not accounting for pinning. It follows\nthat \u2206E = [H, R(\u2206z)] = er (\u2206z/a) and that there\nis force f = \u2206E/\u2206z = er /a. Using [H, R(\u2206z)] =\nS 1/2 (2A/J)1/4 (\u2206z/a)[H, (b\u2020w \u2212 bw )] = er (\u2206z/a) shows\nH contains (2S)\u22121/2 (2A/J)1/4 (~ja2 /e)(b\u2020w + bw ). A\nsimilar term arises from the linear part P\u0303 =\nS\u03b4A sin \u03b80 cos \u03b80 (2S)1/2 (b\u20200 + b0 ) of the pinning term, i.e.,\n[P\u0303 , bw ] = S 3/2 (J/2A)1/4 S\u03b4A sin \u03b80 cos \u03b80 (\u2202\u03b80 /\u2202z)a. Corresponding\nto \u03b80 = 55o , the maximum pinning force, is\n\u221a\n3/2\n(4/3 3)S \u03b4A(b\u2020w +bw ). Finally, the magnon de-pinning\ncurrent is obtained:\n\u0012 2\u0013\neS\n4\n\u03b4A.\n(10)\njc2 = \u221a\n3 3 ~a2\nThis key result is equivalent to equating the rate of creation of linear magnon momentum to the maximum force\nproduced by the pinning potential.\nThe voltage across the wall is easily deduced. For large\nS, a non-polarized contact will inject majority \u2191 electrons on the left and this defines \u03bc\u2191 = \u03bcl as the chemical\npotential of the left contact. For an eigenstate, the energy to add the last \u2191 electron cannot depend on position\nand thus \u03bc\u2191 is the chemical potential for these electrons.\nOne could imagine measuring \u03bc\u2191 on the right with a spin\npolarized contact. The destruction of such an electron\ninvolves destroying a magnon and hence \u03bc\u2191 must be exactly ~\u03c9~k higher in energy than \u03bc\u2193 = \u03bcr , i.e., the majority and contact chemical potential to the right, i.e,\n\u03bcl \u2212 \u03bcr = eV = ~\u03c9~k \u2248 4AS for small currents. There is\nevidently a branch imbalance.\n\n\f4\nthis moving frame, the effective current density is reduced\nto j \u2032 = j(1 \u2212 vv0 ). Then following the calculation for\npinning, the remaining rotations Rip are those required\nfor the pinned ground state. The resulting j \u2032 is given\nby Eqn. (10) and is determined by the pinning strength.\nThe difference between the actual current and that which\ncan be pinned is j \u2212 j \u2032 , and this in turn, determines v\nand its relationship with the current j. The velocity v is\ngiven by:\n\nVelocity (m/s)\n\n8\n\n4\nJk\n0\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n12\n\n2\n\nv = C(j \u2212 jk );\n\nC\u2261\n\na3\n2eS\n\n(11)\n\nCurrent density (10 A/m )\nFIG. 1: The experimental points are taken from [3]. The\nsolid line is estimated to correspond to the value of C from\nEqn. (11) and to a jk \u2248 1.0 \u00d7 1012 A/m2 . (This has been\ncorrected for the fact that the experimental material has a\npolarization p \u2248 0.7.) Evidently to within the errors the\nconduction electron angular momentum, not destroyed by the\npinning center is, transmitted to wall motion with efficiency\nequal to p \u2248 0.7.\n\nBy design, Permalloy has a small intrinsic anisotropy\nand both A and K\u22a5 might be expected \u223c 2\u03c0M0 typically \u223c 0.1T. This is several orders of magnitude smaller\nthan J and it must be expected that, e.g., variations in\nthe wire width lead to variations \u03b4Ji and pinning. The\nlargest effect occurs for the components of \u03b4Ji with a\nlength scale which are comparable to w the wall width.\n\u221a In\nthis case the pinning gap Ep can be as large as \u223c S AJ.\nWith this it would be the case that jr < jc1 and the time\ndependent solution with jc2 will apply.\nHaving considered free motion and pinning it is easy to\nsolve the problem of slow motion with a pinning potential. If a wall is moving slowly and there are many pinning centers, the wall will adiabatically adjust to remain\nin the ground state. The wall width is w = (J/2A)1/2 a\nand therefore the characteristic time the wall, with velocity v, interacts with the pinning center is \u2206t = w/v and\ncorresponds to an energy Ec \u223c ~/\u2206t \u223c ~(2A/J)1/2 (v/a).\nAdiabacity requires that this be less that the energy of\nthe magnons which are involved in the pinning deformations. At the worst these have a k \u223c 1/w and the energy\ninvolved is \u223c 2SA the gap in spin wave spectrum. Adiabatically then implies v < vc \u223c 2S(a/~)(AJ)1/2 which\nis \u223c (A/J)1/2 times the maximum spin wave velocity.\nGiven the experimental values[5] correspond to v \u223c 3m/s\nthis criterion is surely satisfied.\nThe principle of the calculation is to divide into two\nparts the rotating frames used to render the Bloch wall\nstationary, one of which corresponds to the translational\nmotion and a second which reflects the pinning. The displacement corresponds to the rotation operator R(\u2206z) =\nQ\n1/2 \u2020\n(bi \u2212 bi )) where \u2206z = vt.\ni (1 + (1/2)(\u2202\u03b8i /\u2202z)\u2206z(2S)\nGiven the adiabatic approximation is well satisfied the\nrotations R(vt) can be absorbed into slowly time dependent conduction electron operators R(vt)ci R\u22121 (vt). In\n\nwhere, as stated, jk is the jc given by Eqn. (10) except\nthat average rather than maximum pinning strength is\ninvolved. The important result here is that C is independent of jk , i.e., that part of the angular momentum\ncurrent which is in excess of that converted to magnons\nby the pinning potential is 100% converted into motion\nof the wall. In Fig. (1) this prediction, corrected for\np = 0.7, is compared with the experiments of Yamaguchi\net al. Experimentally it is observed that there is a minimum velocity of \u223c 3m/s for which uniform motion is\nobserved. It is reported that no motion of the wall is\nseen for currents smaller that 1.0 \u00d7 1012A/m2 and taking\nthis to be jk implies the solid line shown in the figure\nwith a gradient which would correspond to \u223c pC. What\nis strange is that the same velocity is reported for a currents in the range 1.15 \u00d7 1012 A/m2 to 1.25 \u00d7 1012 A/m2 .\nIt is unfortunate that it is not possible to follow the system to higher velocities in order to see if the initial points\nhave to do with threshold effects, e.g., reflecting the first\norder nature of the transition to the magnon producing\npinned state. The wall will be displaced during the time\nthat the magnon amplitude is developed and, in a pulse\nexperiment, this might be interpreted as depinning.\nThis work was supported by a Grant-in-Ad for Scientific Research on Priority Areas from the Ministry of\nEducation, Science, Culture and Technology of Japan,\nCREST and NAREGI.
