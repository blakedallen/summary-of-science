We show that for any metric space M satisfying certain natural\nconditions, there is a finitely generated group G, an ultrafilter \u03c9, and an isometric embedding \u03b9 of M to the asymptotic cone Cone\u03c9 (G) such that the\ninduced homomorphism \u03b9\u2217 : \u03c01 (M ) \u2192 \u03c01 (Cone\u03c9 (G)) is injective. In particular, we prove that any countable group can be embedded into a fundamental\ngroup of an asymptotic cone of a finitely generated group.\n\n1. Introduction\nTo any metric space X with a distance function dist, one can associate a new\nmetric space Cone\u03c9 (X), the so\u2013called asymptotic cone of X, by taking the ultralimit\nof scaled spaces (X, n1 dist) with respect to an ultrafilter \u03c9. Informally speaking\nCone\u03c9 (X) shows what X looks like if the observer is placed at 'infinity' (see the\nnext section for precise definition). This notion appears in the proof of Gromov's\ntheorem about groups of polynomial growth (it is defined in [3], though in the\npolynomial growth case, where for the convergence to the limit one does not need\nultralimits, the corresponding limit space is considered already in [6]).\nIt is known that a group is hyperbolic if and only if any of its asymptotic cones\nis an R-tree ([7]). (Misha Kapovich pointed out to the first author that if one of\nthe cones of a finitely presented group is an R-tree, then this group is hyperbolic).\nThe application of asymptotic cones to the study of algebraic and geometric\nproperties of hyperbolic groups appears in a different language in [11] and in [18].\nFor a recent progress see [19, 20, 21] and references there. Asymptotic cones can\nbe used for proving rigidity theorems for symmetric spaces [9]. For other results\nabout asymptotic cones we refer to [1, 2, 4, 5, 15, 16, 17, 22, 10].\nThe case when X is a finitely generated group G endowed with a word metric is\nof particular interest. In [7], Gromov pointed out a connection between homotopical\nproperties of Cone\u03c9 (G) and asymptotic invariants of G. Namely, if Cone\u03c9 (G) is\nsimply connected with respect to all ultrafilters, then G is finitely presented and\nthe Dehn function is polynomial. A partial converse result was obtained in [15].\nHowever almost nothing was known about algebraic structure of the fundamental\ngroup \u03c01 (Cone\u03c9 (G)) in case \u03c01 (Cone\u03c9 (G)) is nontrivial. In particular, no examples\nof non\u2013free finitely generated subgroups of such a fundamental groups were known\nuntil now. (It was observed in [2] that the asymptotic cones of Baumslag\u2013Solitar\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Which groups can appear as (finitely generated) subgroups in fundamental groups of asymptotic cones of finitely generated groups?\nIn the present paper we answer this question by proving the following theorem.\nTheorem 1.2. Let M be a metric space such that\n(M1) M is geodesic, that is for any two points x, y \u2208 M there is a path joining x\nand y of length distM (x, y);\n(M2) there is a sequence of compact subsets M1 \u2286 M2 \u2286 . . . of M such that\n\u221e\nS\nMi .\nM=\ni=1\n\nThen there exists a group G generated by 2 elements, an ultrafilter \u03c9, and an\nisometric embedding \u03b9 of M into the asymptotic cone Cone\u03c9 (G). If, in addition,\nM is uniformly locally simply\u2013connected, i.e.,\n(M3) there exists \u03b5 > 0 such that any loop in any ball of radius \u03b5 is contractible,\nthen the induced homomorphism of the fundamental groups\nis injective.\n\n\u03b9\u2217 : \u03c01 (M ) \u2192 \u03c01 (Cone\u03c9 (G))\n\nObviously any combinatorial complex M with countable number of cells in each\ndimension admits a (natural) metric which induces the standard topology on M\nand with respect to which M satisfies (M1)\u2013(M3). Since any countable group is a\nfundamental group of a countable combinatorial 2-complex, we obtain\nCorollary 1.3. For any countable group H, there exists a finitely generated group\nG and an ultrafilter \u03c9 such that \u03c01 (Cone\u03c9 (G)) contains a subgroup isomorphic to\nH.\nThe construction in the proof of Theorem 1.2 is similar to that in [14] and can\nbe intuitively understood as follows. Given a metric space M with metric distM\nsatisfying (M1)\u2013(M3), we first approximate M by finite \u03b5i \u2013nets N eti , where \u03b5i \u2192 0\nas i \u2192 \u221e. Then we choose a rapidly growing sequence of natural numbers {ni }\nand use a construction similar to that from [14] to produce embeddings \u03b1i of N eti\ninto a finitely generated group G endowed with a word metric distG such that \u03b1i ,\nbeing considered as a map from a metric space (N eti , distM ) to (G, n1i distG ), is a\n(\u03bbi , ci )\u2013quasi\u2013isometry, where \u03bbi \u2192 1 and ci \u2192 0 as i \u2192 \u221e. This gives an isometric\nembedding \u03b9 : M \u2192 Cone\u03c9 (G) for any ultrafilter \u03c9 satisfying \u03c9{ni } = 1. Then\ncondition (M3) allows to show that \u03b9 induces an injective map on the fundamental\ngroup \u03c01 (M ).\nThe paper is organized as follows. In the next section we collect main definitions\nand results which are used in what follows. Some auxiliary results about words with\nsmall cancellation properties are proved in Section 3. In Section 4 we construct the\ngroup G and the injective map \u03b9 : M \u2192 Cone\u03c9 (G) mentioned in Theorem 1 and\n\n\fFUNDAMENTAL GROUPS OF ASYMPTOTIC CONES.\n\n3\n\nshow that \u03b9 is an isometry. In Section 5 we conclude the proof of the main theorem\nby proving injectivity of \u03b9\u2217 : \u03c01 (M ) \u2192 \u03c01 (Cone\u03c9 (G)).\n2. Preliminaries\n2.1. Asymptotic cones. Recall that a non-principal ultrafilter \u03c9 is a finitely\nadditive non-zero measure on the set of all subsets of N such that each subset has\nmeasure either 0 or 1 and all finite subsets have measure 0. For any bounded\nfunction h : N \u2192 R its limit h(\u03c9) with respect to a non-principal ultrafilter \u03c9 is\nuniquely defined by the following condition: for every \u03b4 > 0\n\u03c9({i \u2208 N : |h(i) \u2212 h(\u03c9)| < \u03b4}) = 1.\nDefinition 2.1. Let X be a metric space with a distance function dist. We fix a\nbasepoint O \u2208 X and consider the set of all sequences g : N \u2192 X such that\ndist(O, g(i)) \u2264 constg * i\n(here the constant constg depends on g). To any pair of such sequences g1 , g2 one\nmay assign a function\ndist(g1 (i), g2 (i))\n.\nhg1 ,g2 (i) =\ni\nWe say that the sequences g1 , g2 are equivalent if the limit hg1 ,g2 (\u03c9) = 0. The set\nCone\u03c9 (G) of all equivalence classes of sequences with the distance\ndistCone (g1 , g2 ) = hg1 ,g2 (\u03c9)\nis called an asymptotic cone of X with respect to the non-principal ultrafilter \u03c9.\nClearly this space does not depend of the basepoint chosen.\nIf G is a group generated by a finite set S, we can regard G as a metric space\nassuming the distance between two elements a, b \u2208 G to be equal to the length of\nthe shortest word in the alphabet S \u00b11 representing a\u22121 b. Such a distance function\nis called the word metric associated to S. Given an ultrafilter \u03c9, this leads to the\nasymptotic cone Cone\u03c9 (G). It is worth noting that Cone\u03c9 (G) strongly depends on\nthe choice of the ultrafilter [22].\n2.2. Cayley graphs and van Kampen diagrams. Recall that a Cayley graph\nCay(G) of a group G generated by a set S is an oriented labelled 1\u2013complex with\nthe vertex set V (Cay(G)) = G and the edge set E(Cay(G)) = G \u00d7 S. An edge\ne = (g, s) \u2208 E(Cay(G)) goes from the vertex g to the vertex gs and has the label\nLab(e) = s. As usual, we denote the origin and the terminus of the edge e, i.e., the\nvertices g and gs, by e\u2212 and e+ respectively. The word metric on G associated to\nS can be extended to Cay(G) by assuming the length of every edge to be equal to\none. Also, it is easy to see that a word W in S \u00b11 represents 1 in G if and only if\nsome (or, equivalently, any) path p in Cay(G) labelled W is a cycle.\nA planar map \u2206 over a group presentation\n(1)\n\nG = hS | Pi\n\nis a finite oriented connected simply\u2013connected 2\u2013complex endowed with a labelling\nfunction Lab : E(\u2206) \u2192 S \u00b11 (we use the same notation as for Cayley graphs) such\nthat Lab(e\u22121 ) = (Lab(e))\u22121 .\n\n\f4\n\nA.ERSCHLER, D.OSIN\n\nGiven a combinatorial path p = e1 e2 . . . ek in \u2206 (respectively in Cay(G)), where\ne1 , e2 , . . . , ek \u2208 E(\u2206) (respectively e1 , e2 , . . . , ek \u2208 E(Cay(G))), we denote by\nLab(p) its label. By definition, Lab(p) = Lab(e1 )Lab(e2 ) . . . Lab(ek ). We also denote by p\u2212 = (e1 )\u2212 and p+ = (ek )+ the origin and the terminus of p respectively.\nA path p is called irreducible if it contains no subpaths of type ee\u22121 for e \u2208 E(\u2206)\n(respectively e \u2208 E(Cay(G))). The length |p| of p is, by definition, the number k\nof edges of p.\nGiven a cell \u03a0 of \u2206, we denote by \u2202\u03a0 the boundary of \u03a0; similarly, \u2202\u2206 denotes\nthe boundary of \u2206. The label of \u2202\u03a0 or \u2202\u2206 is defined up to a cyclic permutation.\nA map \u2206 over a presentation (1) is called a van Kampen diagram over (1) if the\nfollowing holds. For any cell \u03a0 of \u2206, the boundary label Lab(\u2202\u03a0) is equal to a\ncyclic permutation of a word P \u00b11 , where P \u2208 P. Sometimes it is convenient to use\nthe notion of 0\u2013refinement in order to assume diagrams to be homeomorphic to a\ndisc. We do not explain here this notion and refer the interested reader to [13].\nThe van Kampen lemma states that a word W over the alphabet S \u00b11 represents\nthe identity in the group given by (1) if and only if there exists a simply\u2013connected\nplanar diagram \u2206 over (1) such that Lab(\u2202\u2206) coincides with W [12], [13]. A van\nKampen diagram is called minimal, if it contains the minimal number of cells among\nall diagrams with the same boundary labels.\n2.3. Approximations of metric spaces by graphs. We recall that a subset Z\nis called an \u03b4\u2013net in a metric space Y , if for all y \u2208 Y there exists z \u2208 Z such that\nthe distance between y and z is less than \u03b4. We say that a subset Z of a metric\nspace Y is a (\u03b41 , \u03b42 )\u2013net if Z is a \u03b41 \u2013net and the distance between any two points\nof Z is greater than \u03b42 . The following lemma will be used in Section 4.\nLemma 2.2. Suppose that M is a metric space satisfying conditions (M1) and\n(M2). There exists a sequence of finite subsets N et1 \u2286 N et2 \u2286 . . . of M such that\nfor all i \u2208 N, N eti is a (2/i, 1/i)\u2013net in Mi .\nProof. We proceed by induction on i. Suppose that N eti\u22121 is an (2/(i \u2212 1), 1/(i \u2212\n1))\u2013net in Mi\u22121 if i > 1, and N eti\u22121 = \u2205 if i = 1. We consider an arbitrary finite\n1/i\u2013net N in Mi that contains N eti\u22121 as a subset. Let N denote the set of all\nsubsets L such that N eti\u22121 \u2286 L \u2286 N and for any two different elements x, y \u2208 L\nwe have distM (x, y) > 1/i. Note that the set N is non\u2013empty as it contains N eti\u22121 .\nConsider a partial order on N which corresponds to inclusion, i.e., for any A, B \u2208\nN , A \u0016 B if and only if A \u2286 B. Since N is finite, we can take a maximal subset\nB with respect to this order. Note that for any t \u2208 N , we have distM (t, B) \u2264 1/i.\nIndeed, otherwise B \u222a {t} \u2208 N and thus B is not maximal. Therefore, for any\nx \u2208 Mi , we have distM (x, B) \u2264 2/i. Thus B is an (2/i, 1/i)\u2013net in Mi .\n\u0003\n3. Words with small cancellations\nTo prove the main result of our paper we will need an infinite set of words\nsatisfying a certain small cancellation conditions. We begin with definitions.\nLet X be an alphabet and F a free group with the basis X. Throughout the\nfollowing discussion we write U \u2261 V to express the letter\u2013by\u2013letter equality of the\nwords U and V . Given a word W over the alphabet X, by a cyclic word W we\nmean the set of all cyclic shifts of W . Two cyclic words W1 and W2 are equal if and\n\n\fFUNDAMENTAL GROUPS OF ASYMPTOTIC CONES.\n\n5\n\nonly there exist cyclic shifts U1 , U2 of W1 and W2 respectively such that U1 \u2261 U2 .\nA subword of a cyclic word W is a subword of a cyclic shift of W . By kW k we\ndenote the length of a (cyclic) word W . Finally, for a real number r, [r] means the\ngreatest integer which is less than or equal to r.\nDefinition 3.1. A set T of cyclic words in X satisfies the condition C \u2217 (\u03bb) if for\nall common subwords A of any two different cyclic words B, C \u2208 T \u00b11 , we have\nkAk < \u03bb min{kBk, kCk} and for all cyclic words B \u2208 T \u00b11 , all subwords A of B of\nlength kAk \u2265 \u03bbkBk occur in B only once.\nDefinition 3.2. Given a set T of words in X, we define a growth function of T by\nthe formula\n\u03c3T (n) = \u266fT (n),\nwhere T (n) is the set of all words from T having length exactly n, i.e.,\nT (n) = {W \u2208 T : kW k = n}.\n\nThe main result of this section is the following.\nProposition 3.3. There exists a set T of words in the alphabet X = {a, b} and a\nnon\u2013increasing function \u03bb : N \u2192 (0, 1) satisfying the following conditions.\n(i) The function \u03c3T is non-decreasing and limn\u2192\u221e \u03c3T (n) = \u221e.\n(ii) limn\u2192\u221e \u03bb(n) = 0.\n\u221e\nS\nT (k) satisfies\n(iii) T satisfies C \u2217 (1/50) condition and for all n \u2208 N, the set\nk=n\n\nC \u2217 (\u03bb(n)).\n\nThe proof of Proposition 3.3 is based on four auxiliary lemmas. Recall that for\nany l \u2265 2, a word W is called l-aperiodic if it has no non-empty subwords of the\nform V l . The following lemma can be found in the book [13, Theorem 4.6]\nLemma 3.4. Denote by f (n) the number of all 6-aperiodic words of length n > 0\nover the alphabet X = {a, b}. Then we have\nf (n) > (3/2)n .\n\nLet X (k) = {Xk,1 , . . . , Xk,f (k) } be the set of all different 6-aperiodic\nof\ni\n\u0011\n\u0010h words\nf (k)\n\u22121 ,\nlength k in the alphabet {a, b}. For every k > 8 and every i = 0, 1 . . . ,\nk\nconsider the (cyclic) word\nWk,i = (a6 bXk\u22128,ik+1 b)(a6 bXk\u22128,ik+2 b) . . . (a6 bXk\u22128,ik+k b).\n\n(2)\nSet\n\n\u0015\n\u0013\u001b\n\u001a\n\u0012\u0014\nf (k)\n\u22121\n.\nAk = Wk,i : i = 0, 1, . . . ,\nk\n\nThe next lemma is an immediate consequence of (2) and Lemma 3.4.\nLemma 3.5. For any k > 8 and any W \u2208 Ak , we have:\n(a) kW k = k 2 ;\nk\n\u2212 1.\n(b) #Ak \u2265 (3/2)\nk\n\n\f6\n\nA.ERSCHLER, D.OSIN\n\nLemma 3.6. For any k > 8, the set\n\n\u221e\nS\n\nj=k\n\nAj satisfies C \u2217 ( k3 ).\n\nProof. Suppose that U \u2208 Aj , j \u2265 k, is a cyclic word and V is a subword of U such\nthat kV k \u2265 (3/k)kU k. Then we have kV k \u2265 (3/j)kU k = 3j > 2j + 8. Note that\nany subword of U of length greater than 2j + 8 contains a subword of type\na6 bXj\u22128,i ba6 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Xj\u22128,i \u2208 X (j \u2212 8). Since all words from X (j \u2212 8) are aperiodic and different,\nsuch a subword occurs in U only once. Therefore, V occurs in U once.\n\u221e\nS\nAj and V a common subword\nFurther, let U1 , U2 be two cyclic words from\nj=k\n\nof U1 , U2 such that kV k > (3/k) min{kU1 k, kU2 k}. Arguing as above, we can show\nthat V contains a subword of type (3) for j = min{kU1 k, kU2 k}. It remains to\nobserve that such a subword appears in a unique word from A.\n\u0003\n\nFor each n \u2208 N, n \u2265 81, we construct a set Bn of words over {a, b} as follows.\nFirst we divide each set Ak into (2k + 1) disjoint parts such that\nAk =\n\n(4)\nand\n(5)\n\n\u266fAk,i\n\n2k+1\nG\ni=1\n\nAk,i ,\n\n\u0014\n\n\u266fAk\n\u2265\n2k + 1\n\n\u0015\n\nfor any i = 1, . . . , 2k + 1. We set\nBn = Ak,l\n\u221a\n\u221a 2\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwhere k\u221a= [ n] and l = n \u2212 [ n] . Note that [ n] \u2265 [ 81] > 8 and l \u2264 n \u2212 ( n \u2212\n1)2 = 2 n \u2212 1 \u2264 2k + 1. Thus Bn is well-defined for n \u2265 81. Furthermore, for any\nW \u2208 Bn , we have W \u2208 A[\u221an] . Hence\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(7)\nn \u2265 |W | \u2265 ( n \u2212 1)2 > n \u2212 2 n\n(6)\n\n\u221a\n\nby Lemma 3.5. Finally, given an arbitrary word W \u2208 Bn , we form a new word\n(8)\n\nW = W bm\n\nwhere m = n \u2212 |W |. We call W a core of the word W . Inequality (7) yields\n\u221a\n(9)\n0 \u2264 m < 2 n.\nWe set\nT (n) = {W : W \u2208 Bn },\n\nfor all n \u2265 81 and T (n) = \u2205 for n < 81.\nThe proof of the next lemma is straightforward. We leave it to the reader.\nLemma 3.7. Let A, B, C, D be arbitrary words in the alphabet X. Suppose that\nmax{kCk, kDk} \u2264 y and any common subword of cyclic words A and B has length\nat most x. Then the length of any common subword of the cyclic words AC and\nBD is at most 3x + 2y.\n\n\fFUNDAMENTAL GROUPS OF ASYMPTOTIC CONES.\n\nProof of Proposition 2.1. Let us take T (n) as defined above and set T =\nCombining (5), (6), and Lemma 3.5, we obtain\n\u221a\n\u0015 \"\n\u0014\n\u221a #\n\u266fA[\u221an]\n(3/2)[ n] \u2212 [ n]\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2265 \u221a\n.\n\u03c3(n) = \u266fT (n) = \u266fBn \u2265\n2[ n] + 1\n[ n](2[ n] + 1)\n\n7\n\u221e\nS\n\nk=1\n\nT (k).\n\nEvidently we have limn\u2192\u221e \u03c3(n) = \u221e. Moreover, passing to a subset of T if necessary we can always assume that \u03c3(n) is non\u2013decreasing.\n\u221e\nS\nT (k) satisfies C \u2217 (\u03bb(n)) for\nLet us show that the union\nk=n\n\n\u221a\n9\n2[ n]\n\u221a\n\u03bb(n) = \u221a +\n[ n] n \u2212 2 n\n\nSuppose that U 1 , U 2 are two different words from\n\n\u221e\nS\n\nk=n\n\nT (k), n \u2265 81, and V is a\n\ncommon subword of U 1 , U 2 . Let U1 and U2 be the cores of U 1 and U 2 respectively,\nl = min{kU1 k,\u221akU2 k}. Note that the length of any common subword of U1 and U2\nis at most 3l/[ n] by Lemma 3.6. According to Lemma 3.7 and inequality (9) this\nyields\n\u221a\n\u221a9 l + 2[ n]\nkV k\n[ n]\n\u2264 \u03bb(n).\n\u2264\nl\nmin{kU 1 k, kU 2 k}\nIn case U \u2208\n\n\u221e\nS\n\nk=n\n\nT (k) and V is a common subword of two different cyclic shifts\n\nof U , we obtain the inequality kV k/kU k \u2264 \u03bb(n) in the analogous way. Finally, let\nN be a integer such that \u03bb(N ) \u2264 1/50. Then we set T (n) = \u2205 for all n \u2264 N and\nredefine \u03bb(n) to be equal to 1/50 for all n \u2264 N .\n\u0003\n4. Main construction\nThroughout the rest of the paper we fix a metric space M satisfying conditions\n(M1) and (M2). Let T be the set of words provided by Proposition 3.3 and \u03c3 = \u03c3T\nits growth function. Also, let us fix a sequence\nN et1 \u2286 N et2 \u2286 . . .\nconstructed in Lemma 2.2 such that N eti is a (2/i, 1/i)\u2013net in Mi , i \u2208 N. By \u0393i\nwe denote the complete (abstract) graph with the vertex set N eti . Further, we\nendow \u0393i with a metric in which the length of an edge e with endpoints x and y\nis distM (x, y). Thus there is a map \u0393i \u2192 M that maps each vertex of \u0393i to the\ncorresponding point of N eti and maps edges of \u0393i to geodesics in M . It is clear\nthat the restriction of this map to the set of vertices of \u0393i is an embedding.\nWe consider a sequence ni , i \u2208 N, satisfying the following three conditions:\n(I) {ni /i} is an increasing sequence of natural numbers.\n(II) For any i \u2208 N, \u03c3(ni /i) \u2265 Ni (Ni \u2212 1)/2, where Ni = \u266fN eti .\n(III) ni /i > ni\u22121 diam Mi\u22121 for all i \u2208 N, i \u2265 2.\n\n\f8\n\nA.ERSCHLER, D.OSIN\n\nObviously we can always ensure (I)\u2013(III), choosing ni after ni\u22121 . (Recall that\n\u03c3(n) \u2192 \u221e as n \u2192 \u221e.)\nFor every i \u2208 N, we take an arbitrary orientation on edges of \u0393i . Let E(\u0393i ) denote\nthe set of all oriented edges of \u0393i . In the next lemma \u2308x\u2309 means the smallest integer\ny such that y \u2265 x.\nLemma 4.1. There exists an injective labelling function \u03c6 :\n\n\u221e\nS\n\ni=1\n\nthat for any edge e \u2208 E(\u0393i ) with endpoints x, y, we have\n\nE(\u0393i ) \u2192 T \u00b11 such\n\nk\u03c6(e)k = \u2308ni distM (x, y)\u2309\n\n(10)\n\nand \u03c6(e\u22121 ) = \u03c6(e)\u22121 . In particular, the set {\u03c6(e) | e \u2208 E(\u0393i )} of all edge labels of\n\u0393i satisfies C \u2217 (\u03bb(i)).\nProof. Suppose that x, y \u2208 N eti and u, v \u2208 N etj for some j > i. Then combining\nconditions (I)\u2013(III) and the fact that N etj is an (2/j, 1/j)\u2013net, we obtain\n\u2308ni distM (x, y)\u2309 \u2264 \u2308ni diam Mi \u2309 < \u2308ni+1 /(i + 1)\u2309 \u2264 \u2308nj /j\u2309 \u2264 \u2308nj distM (u, v)\u2309.\nThus it suffices to show that the number lik of unordered pairs x, y \u2208 N eti such\nthat [ni distM (x, y)] = k is less than the number of words of length k in T for every\npossible k. Obviously we have\nlik \u2264\n\nNi (Ni \u2212 1)\n2\n\nand\n\nNi (Ni \u2212 1)\n2\nsince \u03c3 is non\u2013decreasing and distM (x, y) > 1/i for any x, y \u2208 N eti .\nThe assertion \"in particular\" can be derived as follows. Note that ni /i > i by\nthe property (I). Since for any e \u2208 E(\u0393i ), we have\n\u03c3(k) \u2265 \u03c3(ni /i) \u2265\n\nk\u03c6(i)k \u2265 ni distM (e\u2212 , e+ ) \u2265 ni /i > i,\n\u03c6(e) belongs to the union\n\n\u221e\nS\n\nj=i\n\nT (j). It remains to apply Proposition 3.3.\n\n\u0003\n\nIf p = e1 e2 . . . en is a combinatorial path in \u0393i , where e1 , e2 , . . . , en \u2208 E(\u0393i ), we\ndefine the label \u03c6(p) to be the word \u03c6(e1 )\u03c6(e2 ) . . . \u03c6(en ). Let\nRi = {\u03c6(p) | p is an irreducible cycle in \u0393i }\nand\nR=\n\n\u221e\n[\n\ni=1\n\nRi .\n\nFinally, we define the group G by the presentation\n(11)\n\nha, b | Ri.\n\nLet \u2206 be a van Kampen diagram over (11), \u03a0 a cell of \u2206. We say that \u03a0 has\nrank i if Lab(\u2202\u03a0) is a word from Ri . Further, we call a word W in the alphabet\n{a\u00b11 , b\u00b11 } a \u0393i \u2013word if W is a label of some irreducible combinatorial path p in \u0393i .\n(Evidently such a path p is unique as T satisfies C \u2217 (1/50) and \u03c6 is injective.)\n\n\fFUNDAMENTAL GROUPS OF ASYMPTOTIC CONES.\n\n9\n\nSuppose that p is a path in a van Kampen diagram \u2206 over (11). If Lab(p) is a\n\u0393i \u2013word corresponding to the path e1 . . . et in \u0393i , where e1 , . . . , et are edges of \u0393i ,\nthen p can be represented as a product\n(12)\n\np = p1 . . . pt\n\nof its segments p1 , . . . , pt with labels Lab(p1 ) = \u03c6(e1 ), . . . , Lab(pt ) = \u03c6(et ). In this\ncase we call the decomposition (12) a canonical decomposition of p.\nNote that for the boundary p of a cell \u03a0 in \u2206, two edges (say, e and f ) adjacent\nto the vertex (pi )+ = (pi+1 )\u2212 = e+ = f\u2212 for some i can have mutually inverse\nlabels. This allows to identify e with f \u22121 ; then we can pass to the next pair of\nedges adjacent to e\u2212 = f+ and so on. Since T satisfies C \u2217 (1/50), not more than\n1/50 of each segment p1 , . . . , pt can be cancelled by such reductions. The irreducible\npath p\u20321 . . . p\u2032t , where p\u2032i is a subpath of pi , is called a reduced boundary of \u03a0 and is\n48\n|pi |. Also, to each path q in \u2206, we assign\ndenoted by \u2202red \u03a0. Thus we have |p\u2032i | \u2265 50\na path qred which is obtained from q by eliminating edges that do not appear in\nreduced boundaries of cells in \u2206.\nIt seems more natural to consider the reduced boundary. However, in the sequel,\nworking with the notion of the well-attached cells defined below, it is convenient,\nfor technical reasons, to distinguish between the notion of the boundary and that\nof the reduced boundary.\nGiven two cells \u03a01 , \u03a02 of the same rank i in a van Kampen diagram \u2206 over (11),\nwe say that \u03a01 and \u03a02 are well\u2013attached to each other, if the following is true. Up to\na cyclic shift, \u2202\u03a01 (respectively (\u2202\u03a02 )\u22121 ) admits a canonical decomposition \u2202\u03a01 =\np1 . . . pt (respectively (\u2202\u03a02 )\u22121 = q1 . . . qs ) associated to a path e1 . . . et (respectively\nf1 . . . fs ) in \u0393i , where e1 = f1 and p1 = q1 . Let d be the reduced cycle in \u0393i obtained\nfrom e2 . . . et fs\u22121 . . . f2\u22121 . Then the label of the cycle c = p2 . . . pt qs\u22121 . . . q2\u22121 is freely\nequal to the \u0393i \u2013word corresponding to d. Thus, by the definition of Ri , Lab(c) is\nfreely equal to a relator and hence we can replace cells \u03a01 and \u03a02 with one cell (see\n[13] for details).\nNow suppose that \u2202\u2206 = uw, where Lab(w) is a \u0393i \u2013word. We say that a cell \u03a0 of\nrank i is well\u2013attached to a segment w of boundary of \u2206 if, up to a cyclic shift, \u2202\u03a0\n(respectively w\u22121 ) admits a canonical decomposition \u2202\u03a0 = p1 . . . pt (respectively\nw\u22121 = q1 . . . qs ) associated to a path e1 . . . et (respectively f1 . . . fs ) in \u0393i , where\ne1 = f1 and p1 = q1 . In this case we denote by d the reduced cycle in \u0393i obtained\nfrom fs\u22121 . . . f2\u22121 e2 . . . et . Then the label of the path v = qs\u22121 . . . q2\u22121 p2 . . . pt is freely\nequal to the \u0393i \u2013word corresponding to d. Thus, by cutting the cell \u03a0, we obtain a\nsubdiagram \u03a3 of \u2206 such that \u2202\u03a3 = uv, where v is also a \u0393i \u2013word.\nWe can summarize these observations as follows.\nLemma 4.2.

Let us prove the first assertion of the lemma. Up to a cyclic shift, \u2202\u03a01 admits\ncanonical decomposition p1 . . . pt . Let p\u20321 . . . p\u2032t be the corresponding decomposition\nof \u2202red \u03a01 , where p\u2032i is a subpath of pi . Then p and a certain p\u2032i have a common\nsubpath q of length at least (1/20)|p\u2032i | \u2265 (48/1000)|pi|. Let q1 . . . qs be the canonical\ndecomposition of \u2202\u03a02 , q1\u2032 . . . qs\u2032 the corresponding decomposition of \u2202red \u03a02 . Let Z\ndenote the set of endpoints of paths q1\u2032 , . . . , qs\u2032 . If q is cut by vertices from Z into at\nmost two parts, then one of these parts has length at least 1/2|q| \u2265 (24/1000)|pi| >\n(1/50)|pi |. If q contains more than one vertex from Z, then qj\u2032 is a subpath of\npi for some j (note that |qj\u2032 | \u2265 (48/50)|qj |). In both cases we found a common\nsubpath of pi and qj of length at least (1/50) min{|pi |, |qj |}. Therefore the labels\nof edges ei and fj of \u0393k and \u0393l respectively corresponding to pi and qj contain a\ncommon subword of length at least (1/50) min{k\u03c6(ei )k, k\u03c6(fj )k}. Since T satisfies\nC \u2217 (1/50) and \u03c6 is injective, we have pi = qj , k = l, and ei = fj . The proof of the\nsecond assertion is similar and we leave it to the reader.\n\u0003\nFrom Lemmas 4.2 and 4.3, we immediately obtain\nCorollary 4.4.\n(1) Let \u2206 be a minimal van Kampen diagram over (11).

We provide it for convenience of the reader.\nLemma 4.5. Suppose that W is a \u0393i \u2013word. Then there exists a word V such that\nW = V in G, V is of the minimal length among all of the words (not necessarily\n\u0393i \u2013words) representing the same element as W in G, and V is freely equal to a\n\u0393i \u2013word.\nProof. Let V be a shortest word representing the same element as W in G. We\nconsider a van Kampen diagram \u2206 over (11) corresponding to this equality. Without loss of generality we may assume that the word W and \u2206 are chosen in such a\nway that \u2206 has the minimal number of cells among all diagrams corresponding to\nequalities of V to \u0393i \u2013words. We are going to show that \u2206 contains no cells at all,\nand thus V is freely equal to a \u0393i \u2013word.\n\n\fFUNDAMENTAL GROUPS OF ASYMPTOTIC CONES.\n\n11\n\nAssume that there is at least one cell in \u2206. Denote by \u2206\u2032 the map obtained\nfrom \u2206 by eliminating all edges that do not appear in reduced boundaries of cells\nof \u2206. Then \u2206\u2032 , as a map, satisfies C \u2032 (1/10) small cancellation condition (see\n[12][Chapter 5]) by Corollary 4.4. By Greendlinger's Lemma, this means that \u2206\ncontains a cell \u03a0 such that there is a common subpath of \u2202red \u03a0 and (\u2202\u2206)red of\nlength |p| > 0.7|\u2202red \u03a0|. (We substitute \u03bb = 0.1 in the Greendlinger's constant 1\u22123\u03bb\nfrom [12]).\nThe boundary of \u2206 consists of two parts v and w corresponding to words V\n\u00b11\nand W . If the path p has a common subpath with wred\nof length at least 0.1|\u2202\u03a0|,\nthen \u03a0 is well\u2013attached to the subpath w of \u2202\u2206 by Lemma 4.3. However, by the\nsecond assertion of Lemma 4.2 this contradicts to the choice of W and \u2206. Hence\n\u00b11\nthere is a common subpath q of \u2202red \u03a0 and vred\nsuch that |q| > (0.7 \u2212 0.2)|\u2202red\u03a0| =\n0.5|\u2202red \u03a0|. Thus \u2202red \u03a0 = qq1 , |q| > |q1 |, and the words Lab(q), Lab(q1 ) represent\nthe same element in the group G. But Lab(q) is a subword of V and we arrive at a\ncontradiction to our choice of V as a shortest word representing the same element\nas W in G.\n\u0003\nDefinition 4.6. For each i \u2208 N, we construct an embedding\n\u03b1i : N eti \u2192 G\nas follows. Let us fix a point O in N et1 (and thus O \u2208 N eti for all i). Then for\nany x \u2208 N eti there is a combinatorial path p in \u0393i such that p\u2212 = O, p+ = x. We\ndefine \u03b1i (x) to be equal to the element of G represented by \u03c6(p). Note that \u03b1i (x)\nis independent of the choice of p. Indeed, if q is another path in \u0393i with the origin\nO and terminus x, then pq \u22121 is a cycle and thus \u03c6(p)\u03c6(q \u22121 ) is a relator from Ri ,\ni.e., \u03c6(p) and \u03c6(q) represent the same element of G.\nLemma 4.7. Let distG denote the word metric on G corresponding to the generating set {a, b}. Then for any i \u2208 N and any x, y \u2208 N eti , we have\n(13)\n\n(1 \u2212 2\u03bb(i))distM (x, y) \u2264\n\n1\n1\ndistG (\u03b1i (x), \u03b1i (y)) \u2264 distM (x, y) + .\nni\nni\n\nProof. If e is an edge in \u0393i such that e\u2212 = x, e+ = y, and a, b are edges in \u0393i\nsuch that a\u2212 = b+ = O, a+ = x, b\u2212 = y, then aeb is a cycle in \u0393i . Therefore\n\u03c6(a)\u03c6(e)\u03c6(b) labels a cycle c in Cay(G) with beginning at 1. Let c = psq, where\nLab(p) \u2261 \u03c6(a), Lab(s) \u2261 \u03c6(e), Lab(q) \u2261 \u03c6(b). Since by definition p+ = \u03b1i (x) and\nq\u2212 = \u03b1i (y), the elements \u03b1i (x) and \u03b1i (y) are connected by the path s in Cay(G).\nTherefore,\ndistG (\u03b1i (x), \u03b1i (y)) \u2264 |s| = k\u03c6(e)k = \u2308ni distM (x, y)\u2309 \u2264 ni distM (x, y) + 1.\nThis gives the right hand side inequality in (13).\nFurther, by Lemma 4.5, there exists a word V representing the element (\u03b1i (x))\u22121 \u03b1i (y))\nand a \u0393i \u2013word U freely equal to V such that\n(14)\n\nkV k = distG (1, \u03b1i (x))\u22121 \u03b1i (y)) = distG (\u03b1i (x), \u03b1i (y)).\n\nObviously we have\n(15)\n\nkV k \u2265 (1 \u2212 2\u03bb(i))kU k\n\n\f12\n\nA.ERSCHLER, D.OSIN\n\nsince the set of edge labels of \u0393i satisfies C \u2217 (\u03bb(i)) by Lemma 4.1. Let r = e1 . . . et\nbe the path in \u0393i corresponding to U . Then, arguing as in the first case, we can\nshow that r\u2212 = x, r+ = y and thus\n(16)\n\nkU k =\n\nt\nX\nj=1\n\nk\u03c6(ej )k =\n\nt\nX\nj=1\n\nni distM ((ej )\u2212 , (ej )+ ) \u2265 ni distM (x, y).\n\nCombining (14), (15), and (16) we obtain the left hand inequality in (13).\n\n\u0003\n\nDefinition 4.8. We take a non\u2013principal ultrafilter \u03c9 such that \u03c9({ni }) = 1 and\nconsider the asymptotic cone Cone\u03c9 (G) of G with respect to this ultrafilter. Our\nnext goal is to define an embedding \u03b9 of M to Cone\u03c9 (G).\nLet x be a point of M . Then there is a sequence of points xi \u2208 N eti such that\nxi \u2192 x as i \u2192 \u221e. We define \u03b9(x) to be the point of Cone\u03c9 (G) represented by an\narbitrary sequence {gi }, where gni = \u03b1i (xi ) for any i \u2208 N. Obviously \u03b9 is well\u2013\ndefined as the point of Cone\u03c9 (G) representing the sequence {gi } depends on the\nsubsequence {gni } only.\nProposition 4.9. Suppose that M is a metric space satisfying (M1) and (M2).\nThen the map \u03b9 is an isometry.\nProof. Let x, y be points of M , {xi }, {yi } the sequences of elements of nets N eti\nsuch that xi \u2192 x as i \u2192 \u221e and yi \u2192 y as i \u2192 \u221e. Let {gi } and {hi } be\nthe corresponding sequences of elements of G representing \u03b9(x) and \u03b9(y). Then\napplying Lemma 4.7, we have\ndistM (x, y) =\n\n1\ndistG (\u03b1i (xi ), \u03b1i (yi ))\ni\u2192\u221e ni\n\nlim distM (xi , yi ) = lim\n\ni\u2192\u221e\n\n=\n\nlim 1i distG (gi , hi ) = distCone (\u03b9(x), \u03b9(y)).\n\u03c9\n\n\u0003\n5. Embedding of the fundamental group\nAll assumptions and notation from the previous section remain in force here.\nIn particular, \u03b9 denotes the isometry M \u2192 Cone\u03c9 (G) constructed in the previous\nsection. In addition we suppose that M satisfies (M3). Also, let \u03b9\u2217 denote the\nhomomorphism \u03c01 (M ) \u2192 \u03c01 (Cone\u03c9 (G)) induced by \u03b9. We conclude the proof of\nTheorem 1.2 by proving the following.\nProposition 5.1. Suppose that M satisfies (M1)\u2013(M3). Then the map \u03b9\u2217 : \u03c01 (M ) \u2192\n\u03c01 (Cone\u03c9 (G)) is injective.\nProof. Let S = [0, 1] \u00d7 [0, 1] be a unit square and \u03b3 : \u2202S \u2192 M a loop in M such\nthat \u03b9\u03b3 is contractible in Cone\u03c9 (G). We want to show that \u03b3 is contractible in M .\nSince \u03b9\u03b3 is contractible in Cone\u03c9 (G), there exists a continuous map r : S \u2192\nCone\u03c9 (G) such that the restriction of r to \u2202S coincides with \u03b9\u03b3. The unit square\nS is compact, and therefore r is uniformly continuous. Hence there exists \u03b4 such\nthat for any y1 , y2 \u2208 B which lie at distance at most \u03b4 in B, we have\n(17)\n\ndistCone (r(x), r(y)) < \u03b5/20.\n\n\fFUNDAMENTAL GROUPS OF ASYMPTOTIC CONES.\n\n13\n\nWe can also assume that 1/\u03b4 \u2208 N. By Grid\u03b4 we denote the standard \u03b4\u2013net in S\nthat is the set\nGrid\u03b4 = {(a\u03b4, b\u03b4) | a, b \u2208 Z, 0 \u2264 a, b \u2264 1/\u03b4}.\n\nBy r(Grid\u03b4 ) we denote the image of Grid\u03b4 in Cone\u03c9 (G).\n\u0012\u221e\n\u0013\nS\nFor every point x \u2208 r(Grid\u03b4 ) \u222a\n\u03b9(N eti ) we fix an arbitrary sequence {xi }\ni=1\n\nof elements of G that represents x in Cone\u03c9 (G) (such a sequence will be called a\nstandard representative of x). Let \u03b5 be the constant from (M3). We take L \u2208 N\nsuch that the following conditions hold:\n(L0) r(Grid\u03b4 ) is contained in \u03b9(ML );\n(L1) 1/L < \u03b5/20; in particular, 1/nL < \u03b5/20;\n(L2) for any two points x, y \u2208 r(Grid\u03b4 ) \u222a \u03b9(N etL ), we have\n1\ndistG (xnL , ynL ) \u2212 distCone (x, y) \u2264 \u03b5/20,\nnL\nwhere {xi }, {yi } are standard representatives of x and y respectively.\n\n(Note that for any l there exist L > l such that (L0)\u2013(L2) hold.)\nWe say that two points x, y in Grid\u03b4 are neighbors, if they have the form x =\n(a\u03b4, b\u03b4), y = ((a + 1)\u03b4, b\u03b4) or x = (a\u03b4, b\u03b4), y = (a\u03b4, (b + 1)\u03b4). If x, y \u2208 Grid\u03b4\nare neighbors and {xi } , {yi } are standard representatives of r(x), r(y), we fix an\narbitrary geodesic in the Cayley graph G going from the element xnL to ynL and\ndenote this geodesic by g(xnL , ynL ). Further for every point x \u2208 Grid\u03b4 which lies\non \u2202S, we take a point tx \u2208 \u03b9(N etL ) which is closest to r(x); in particular, we have\n(18)\n\ndistCone (tx , r(x)) \u2264 2/L \u2264 0.1\u03b5\n\nas r(x) \u2208 \u03b9(ML ) by (L0) and \u03b9(N etL ) is a 2/L\u2013net in \u03b9(ML ) (recall that \u03b9 is an\nisometry). Suppose that {txi } is the standard representative of tx . Then we join\nelements xnL and txnL by a geodesic h(xnL , txnL ) in Cay(G). Finally, if x, y \u2208 \u2202S\nare neighbors and tx , ty are the corresponding points of \u03b9(N etL ), then we denote\nby k(txnL , tynL ) a path in Cay(G) joining txnL to tynL such that the label of k is equal\nto \u03c6(e), where e is the edge of \u0393L satisfying the conditions \u03b9(e\u2212 ) = tx , \u03b9(e+ ) = ty .\nIn particular, we have\n(19)\n\n|k(txnL , tynL )| = k\u03c6(e)k = \u2308nL distCone (tx , ty )\u2309\n\nLet x1 , . . . , xm , where m = 4/\u03b4, be subsequent points of Grid\u03b4 \u2229 \u2202S (i.e., xi and\nx\nare neighbors, where indices are modulo m). Then the label of the cycle\ni+1\n\n(20)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\nm\n\n1\n\np = k(txnL , txnL )k(txnL , txnL ) . . . k(txnL , txnL )\n\nis a \u0393i \u2013word. We construct a van Kampen diagram \u039e with boundary label Lab(\u2202\u039e) \u2261\n\u03c6(p) as follows. The net Grid\u03b4 allows to regard S as a union of \u03b412 small squares\nwith sides of length \u03b4. For any such a square with vertices x, y, z, t in Grid\u03b4 , we\nconsider a minimal van Kampen diagram (homeomorphic to a disk) with boundary\nlabel\n(21)\n\nLab(g(xnL , ynL )g(ynL , znL )g(znL , tnL )g(tnL , xnL )).\n\n\f14\n\nA.ERSCHLER, D.OSIN\n\nAlso, if x, y \u2208 \u2202S\u2229Grid\u03b4 are neighbors, we consider a minimal van Kampen diagram\n(homeomorphic to a disk) with boundary label\n(22)\n\nLab(g(xnL , ynL )h(ynL , tynL )k(tynL , txnL )(h(xnL , txnL ))\u22121 ).\n\nWe call the constructed diagrams with boundary labels (21), (22) elementary. Gluing these elementary diagrams together in the obvious way we obtain a diagram \u039e\nover (11) such that Lab(\u2202\u039e) is the \u0393i \u2013word defined by (20).\nWe are going to show that the perimeter of each elementary diagram is less than\n0.7nL \u03b5. Indeed, inequality (17) and condition (L2) together yield\n(23)\n|g(xnL , ynL )| = distG (xnL , ynL ) \u2264 nL (distCone (r(x), r(y)) + 0.05\u03b5) \u2264 0.1nL \u03b5\n\nfor any two neighbors x, y \u2208 Grid\u03b4 . If x \u2208 Grid\u03b4 \u2229 \u2202S, then (L1),(L2) and (18)\nimply\n(24)\n\n|h(xnL , txnL )| = distG (xnL , txnL ) \u2264 nL (distCone (r(x), tx ) + 0.05\u03b5)\n\u2264 nL (2/L + 0.05\u03b5) \u2264 0.15nL \u03b5.\n\nFinally, if x, y \u2208 \u2202S are neighbors, then combining (17), (18), and (19) we obtain\n|k(txnL , tynL )| = \u2308nL distCone (tx , ty )\u2309 \u2264\n\n(25)\n\n\u2308nL (distCone (tx , r(x)) + distCone (r(x), r(y)) + distCone (r(y), ty ))\u2309 \u2264\n\u23080.25nL \u03b5\u2309 \u2264 0.25nL \u03b5 + 1 \u2264 0.3nL \u03b5\n\nTherefore, any word of type (21) or (22) has length at most 0.7nL \u03b5.\nLemma 5.2. Let \u03a0 be a cell of rank L in \u039e, l the loop in \u0393L corresponding to the\n\u0393L \u2013word Lab(\u2202\u03a0). Then l is contractible in M .\nProof. Note that \u03a0 lies in some elementary diagram \u0398. Since any elementary\ndiagram is minimal, it satisfies C \u2032 (1/10) small cancellation condition as a map by\nCorollary 4.4. Hence the length of the reduced boundary of any cell in \u0398 is not\ngreater than |\u2202\u0398| \u2264 0.7nL \u03b5. This means that\n50\n35\n|\u2202\u03a0| \u2264\n|\u2202red \u03a0| \u2264\nnL \u03b5 < nL \u03b5.\n48\n48\nLet l = e1 . . . et , where e1 , . . . , et are edges of \u0393L .

Consider a van Kampen diagram \u2206 with boundary labelled by a GL \u2013\nword. Suppose that boundary label of each cell of rank L in this diagram corresponds\nto a contractible loop in M . Then the boundary label of the diagram also corresponds\nto a contractible loop in M .\nProof. We prove the statement of the lemma by induction on the number s of cells\nin the diagram. If s = 0 the statement is obvious, so we assume that s \u2265 1.\nBy Grindlinger's lemma at least one of the following two statements holds.\n\n\fFUNDAMENTAL GROUPS OF ASYMPTOTIC CONES.\n\n15\n\n1) There exist two cells \u03a01 and \u03a02 and a common subpath p of \u2202red \u03a01 and\n1\nmin{|\u2202red \u03a01 |, |\u2202red \u03a02 |}.\n\u2202red \u03a02 such that |p| \u2265 10\n2) There exist a cell \u03a0 and a common subpath p of \u2202red \u03a0 and \u2202\u2206 such that\n7\n|p| \u2265 10\n|\u2202red \u03a0|.\nIn the first case \u03a01 and \u03a02 have the same rank and are well\u2013attached to each\nother by Lemma 4.3. Arguing as in the proof of Lemma 4.2, we can replace \u03a01 and\n\u03a02 by one cell \u03a5. If rank \u03a01 = rank \u03a02 6= L, the statement is true by the inductive\nhypothesis. To use the inductive hypothesis in case rank \u03a01 = rank \u03a02 = L, we\nhave to check that the cycle s corresponding to the new cell \u03a5 is contractible in\nM . Indeed, if p, q are cycles corresponding to \u03a01 and \u03a02 (we may assume that\np\u2212 = q\u2212 ), then s is homotopic to the product of p and q \u22121 . Since p and q are\ncontractible in M by the condition of the lemma, s is contractible in M .\nIn the second case \u03a0 has rank L by Lemma 4.2 and is well\u2013attached to the\nboundary of \u2206. We pass to the subdiagram \u03a3 of \u2206 obtained by cutting the cell\n\u03a0. Applying Lemma 4.2 again, we conclude that Lab(\u2202\u03a3) is a \u0393L \u2013word. By the\ninductive assumption the cycle c corresponding to Lab(\u2202\u03a3) is contractible in M .\nLet d be the cycle in \u0393L corresponding to Lab(\u2202\u03a0), f the cycle corresponding to\nLab(\u2202\u2206) . As in the previous case, f is homotopic to the product of c and d\u22121 and\nhence is contractible in M .\n\u0003\nNow we return to the proof of the proposition. The two previous lemmas imply\nthat the loop q in \u0393L , corresponding to the boundary label of the diagram \u039e under\nconsideration is contractible.\nAs above, let x1 , . . . , xm be subsequent neighbors in Grid\u03b4 \u2229 \u2202S. For every two\nneighbors xi , xi+1 (indices are modulo m), we denote by ci , di , ei , fi the segment\n[r(xi ), r(xi+1 )] of \u03b9\u03b3, the geodesic path from r(xi+1 ) to txi+1 , the edge e of \u0393i such\nthat \u03b9(e\u2212 ) = txi+1 , \u03b9(e+ ) = txi , and the geodesic path from txi to r(xi ) respectively.\nNote that for any i = 1, . . . , m, the the cycle ai = ci di ei fi is contained in the ball\nBi = Bi (0.35\u03b5, xi ) of radius 0.35\u03b5 around r(xi ) in Cone\u03c9 (G). Indeed any point\nof ci is contained in Bi by (17). Further since di and fi are geodesic, di and fi\nare contained in 0.1\u03b5\u2013neighborhoods of r(xi+1 ) and r(xi ) respectively according to\n(18); together with (17) this implies that di and ci lay in Bi . Finally, each point of\nei belongs to Bi as ei is geodesic, the distance between r(xi ) and the end of ei is at\nmost 0.1\u03b5, and the length of ei is at most 0.25\u03b5 by the triangle inequality. Thus ai\nis contained in Bi . Since \u03b9 is an isometry, this means that the preimage of ai under\n\u03b9 : M \u2192 Cone\u03c9 (G) is contractible in M by (M3). Hence \u03b9(q) is homotopic to \u03b9\u03b3 via\na homotopy in M . Hence \u03b3 is contractible in M according to Lemma 5.3.\n\u0003\n6. Concluding remarks and questions\nWe have shown that any countable group can be embedded into a fundamental group of an asymptotic cone of some finitely generated group. Note that our\nproof also shows that any recursively presentable group can be embedded into a\nfundamental group of some finitely presentable group.\nThe construction of our group depends on a space M and a scaling sequence nk .\nSimilarly we can start with a countable set of spaces Nj (satisfying (M1) -(M3)),\ntake a countable set of non-intersecting scaling sequences njk (Nj ) and construct a\ngroup G, such that for each j there is a scale on which Nj is embedded into the\n\n\f16\n\nA.ERSCHLER, D.OSIN\n\nasymptotic cone of G. A natural task is to check that starting with the spaces with\nvery different fundamental groups (e.g. Z/pZ for different p) one gets asymptotic\ncones (on different scales) with infinitely many different fundamental groups. Then\nunder certain conditions on the spaces the group G is recursively presentable and\nwe can embed it into a finitely presentable group. Again, a natural task is to check\nthat one can chose this embedding in such a way that this finitely presented group\nhas different fundamental groups on different scales.\nAnother natural question is: does there exists a finitely presented group such\nthat the simple connectivity of the asymptotic cone depends on the choice of the\nultrafilter?\nFinally let us mention that recently L.Kramer,S. Shelah, K.Tent and S. Thomas\n[10] have shown that if continuum hypothesis fails, than there exist finitely presented groups (which are uniform lattices in certain semisimple Lie groups) that\nhave infinitely many different asymptotic cones. However, if continuum hypothesis\nholds, than the examples from [10] have unique asymptotic cones.\nAcknowledgements.
