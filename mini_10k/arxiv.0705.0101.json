A rather unique feature for the light hadron decay\nof charmonia is that the transition occurs via gluon-rich processes. At charmonium mass region, vast investigations\nin the literature suggest that non-perturbative QCD effects are still important and sometimes can become dominant.\nThrough the study of the hadronic decay of charmonia, one may gain some insights into the quark-gluon transition\nmechanisms in the interplay between non-perturbative and perturbative QCD. One is recommended to Ref. [8] for a\ndetailed review and prospect of the relevant issues.\nDifferent from the S-wave quarkonia, where the annihilation of the heavy quark and antiquark is a short-distance\nprocess, the pQCD calculation of the P -wave quarkonium decays encounters infrared divergences at order \u03b13s . For the\ntwo photon decays of P -wave charmonia various studies can be found in the literature [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,\n18, 19, 20]. The situation becomes quite complicated in the quarkonium exclusive hadronic decays, where higher order\ncorrections are no longer a trivial task [21]. Attempts were made by Anselmino and Murgia [22] who found that quark\nmass corrections became significant in \u03c7c \u2192 V V . Some distinguishable features in the angular distributions of the\nfinal-state-vector-meson decays were also pinned down. More recently Braguta et al. [23, 24] investigated the influence\nof the internal quark motions on the scalar and tensor decays into two vectors in the colour-singlet approximation.\nTheir prediction for \u03c7c0 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c9 branching ratio was in good agreement with the data, but significant discrepancies\nwere found for \u03c7c2 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c9 compared with the data, which may be due to the model sensitivity to the choice of the\nmeson structure functions and possible contributions from the neglected colour-octet state [14].\nDifferent roles played by the pQCD transitions and nonperturbative mechanisms in \u03c7c0,2 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 were studies by Zhou,\nPing, and Zou [25], who found that the pQCD calculations for \u03c7c2 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 could reproduce the data, while the results\nfor \u03c7c0 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 were underestimated. In contrast, they showed that nonperturbative 3 P0 quark pair creation mechanism\ncould enhance the \u03c7c0 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 branching ratio, but with rather small contributions to \u03c7c2 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6. Their results suggest\nthat nonperturbative mechanisms are important in \u03c7c0 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6, while pQCD transitions is likely dominant in \u03c7c2 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6.\nAll these still-controversial observations make the study of the exclusive decay of \u03c7c0,2 \u2192 V V , P P , and SS extremely\ninteresting. Since the decay of \u03c7c0,2 into light hadrons is via the so-called singly OZI disconnected processes (SOZI),\nthe study of \u03c7c0,2 \u2192 V V , P P and SS will shed light on the OZI-rule violation phenomena, which are generally driven\nby nonperturbative mechanisms. Nonetheless, in the isoscalar-meson-pair decay channel, the doubly OZI disconnected\nprocess (DOZI) may also contribute. The role played by the DOZI processes and their correlations with the production\nmechanisms of isoscalar scalar meson f0 states are an interesting issue in the study of the structure of the light scalar\nmesons at 1\u223c 2 GeV, i.e., f0 (1370), f0 (1500), f0 (1710), and f0 (1810).\nIn this work, we shall present a systematic analysis of the exclusive decays of \u03c7c0,2 \u2192 V V , P P and SS based\non an improved parametrization scheme proposed recently [26]. In light of the new data from BES [6] and CLEO-c\nCollaboration [7], we shall identify the role played by the DOZI processes, and gain some insights into the scalar\nstructures in \u03c7c0,2 \u2192 SS.\nThe content is organized as follows: In Section II, the parametrization scheme for \u03c7c0,2 \u2192 M M is summarized. In\nSection III, we present the analysis and numerical results for \u03c7c0,2 \u2192 M M in line with the most recent data from\nBES and CLEO-c. A short summary will be given in Section IV.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nPARAMETRIZATION FOR \u03c7c0,2 \u2192 M M\n\nIn Ref. [26] the decay of \u03c7c0,2 \u2192 V V , P P and SS was investigated in a parametrization scheme where the\nproduction of the final state hadrons were described by a set of transition amplitudes for either SOZI or DOZI\nprocesses. Such a parametrization as a leading order approximation is useful for identifying the roles played by\ndifferent transition mechanisms and will avoid difficulties arising from our poor knowledge about the nonperturbative\ndynamics. Associated with the up-to-date experimental data, we can constrain the model parameters and make\npredictions which can be tested in future measurements.\nThe detailed definition of the parametrization was given in Ref. [26], we only summarize the main ingredients here\nwith slightly rephrased expressions:\ni) The basic transition amplitude is defined to be the cc\u0304 annihilation into two gluons which then couple to two\nnon-strange quark pairs to form final state mesons:\nh(q1 q \u03042 )M1 (q3 q \u03044 )M2 |V0 |\u03c7c i \u2261 gh14i gh23i \u2261 g02 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere V0 is the interaction potential, and q(q\u0304) is non-strange quark (antiquark) with gh14i = gh23i = g0 . Basically, such\na coupling will depend on the quantum numbers of the initial quarkonium. We separate the partial decay information\nby introducing a conventional form factor in the calculation, i.e., F (|p|) \u2261 |p|2l exp(\u2212|p|2 /8\u03b2 2 ) with \u03b2 = 0.5 GeV,\nfor the relative l-wave two-body decay.\nii) To include the SU(3) flavour symmetry breaking effects, we introduce\nR \u2261 h(qs\u0304)M1 (sq\u0304)M2 |V0 |\u03c7c i/g02 = h(sq\u0304)M1 (qs\u0304)M2 |V0 |\u03c7c i/g02 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhich implies the occurrence of the SU(3) flavour symmetry breaking at each vertex where a pair of ss\u0304 is produced,\nand R = 1 is in the SU(3) flavour symmetry limit. For the production of two ss\u0304 pairs via the SOZI potential, the\nrecognition of the SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking in the transition is accordingly\nR2 = h(ss\u0304)M1 (ss\u0304)M2 |V0 |\u03c7c i/g02 .\n\n(3)\n\niii) The DOZI process is parametrized by introducing parameter r accounting for its relative strength to the SOZI\namplitude:\nr \u2261 h(ss\u0304)M1 (q q\u0304)M2 |V1 |\u03c7c i/g02 = h(q q\u0304)M1 (ss\u0304)M2 |V1 |\u03c7c i/g02 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere V1 denotes the interaction potential.\niv) Scalar glueball state can be produced in company with an isoscalar q q\u0304 or in pair in the final state. We parametrize\ntheir amplitudes by introducing an additional quantity t for the relative strength of the process of glueball production\nrecoiling a q q\u0304 to the basic amplitude g02 :\nh(q q\u0304)G|V2 |\u03c7c i \u2261 th(q q\u0304)M1 (q q\u0304)M2 |V0 |\u03c7c i = tg02 .\n\n(5)\n\nA reasonable assumption for the glueball coupling is that the glueball does not pay a price to couple to gg, namely,\nthe so-called \"flavor-blind assumption\" following the gluon counting rule. Under such a condition, parameter t has a\nvalue of unity, and the glueball production amplitude is of the same strength as the basic amplitude g02 . Similarly,\nthe production of a glueball pair can be expressed as\nhGG|V3 |\u03c7c i = th(q q\u0304)G|V2 |\u03c7c i = t2 g02 .\n\n(6)\n\nConsidering a general expression for isoscalar meson pair production with q q\u0304 and glueball components, e.g. M1,2 =\nx1,2 |Gi + y1,2 |ss\u0304i + z1,2 |nn\u0304i, we can write the transition amplitude for \u03c7c \u2192 M1 M2 as\nhM1 (I = 0)M2 (I = 0)|(V0 + V1 + V2 + V3 )|\u03c7c i\n= h(x1 G + y1 ss\u0304 + z1 nn\u0304)(x2 G + y2 ss\u0304 + z2 nn\u0304)|(V0 + V1 + V2 + V3 )|\u03c7c i\n\u221a\n\u221a\n= g02 [(x1 t(tx2 + Ry2 + 2z2 ) + y1 R(tx2 + (1 + r)Ry2 + 2rz2 )\n\u221a\n\u221a\n+z1 ( 2tx2 + 2rRy2 + (1 + 2r)z2 )] .\n\n(7)\n\nFor meson pair production with isospin I = 1/2 and 1, the transitions only occur via potential V0 , and they can be\nexpressed as\nhM1 (I = 1/2)M2 (I = 1/2)|V0 |\u03c7c i = Rg02 ,\nhM1 (I = 1)M2 (I = 1)|V0 |\u03c7c i = g02 .\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\n\f3\nThe modification of the above parametrization rule compared to Ref. [26] is on the glueball production. Here,\nparameters r and t are explicitly separated out. Parameter r describes the property of the q q\u0304-gg couplings in the\nDOZI processes. Apparent contributions from the DOZI processes generally demonstrate the importance of the OZIrule violations due to long-range interactions [27]. In contrast, parameter t distinguishes the G-gg coupling from the\nq q\u0304-gg, and will allow us to investigate the role played by glueball productions. In the present scheme the underlying\nphysics denoted by the parameters can be more clearly identified.\nIII.\n\nDECAY OF \u03c7c0,2 \u2192 M M\n\nIn this Section we revisit \u03c7c0,2 \u2192 V V , P P and SS taking into account the new data from both BES and CLEO-c.\nA.\n\n\u03c7c0,2 \u2192 V V\n\nFor \u03c7c0,2 \u2192 V V , three channels, i.e. \u03c6\u03c6, \u03c9\u03c9 and K \u22170 K \u0304\u22170 , have been measured by BES collaboration [1, 2, 3].\nSince we neglect glueball component in \u03c9 and \u03c6, and assume that \u03c9 is pure nn\u0304 and \u03c6 is pure ss\u0304 due to ideal mixing,\nwe can determine parameters g0 , r, and R. Predictions for \u03c7c0,2 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1 and \u03c9\u03c6 can then be made.\nIn Table I, the parameters are presented. In Table II, we list the fitting results for \u03c7c0,2 \u2192 V V in comparison with\nthe experimental data [1, 2, 3]. Also, the result by fitting the PDG average values for \u03c7c0,2 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6, \u03c9\u03c9 and K \u22170 K \u0304\u22170\nare included.\nOne apparent feature is that the OZI-rule violation and SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking are much obvious in\n\u03c7c0 \u2192 V V than in \u03c7c2 \u2192 V V . Parameter r is found to be about 20% for \u03c7c0 , while its central values are about\n1% for \u03c7c2 though the uncertainties are about 10%. The consequence of small DOZI process contributions is that\nthe production branching ratios for \u03c7c0,2 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c6 become rather small. For instance, predictions for the branching\nratio of \u03c7c0 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c6 are at least one order of magnitude smaller than \u03c6\u03c6 channel, and the PDG averaged values for\nthe experimental data lead to a negligibly small branching ratio for \u03c7c2 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c6. Further experimental measurement\nconfirmation of this prediction will be extremely interesting.\nThe \u03c1\u03c1 branching ratio turns to be sensitive to the experimental uncertainties carried by those available data.\nDifferent from other decay channels, which are determined by parameters r, R and g0 in a correlated way, it only\ndepends on parameter g0 . Therefore, the \u03c1\u03c1 channel is ideal for testing this parametrization scheme, and can put\nfurther constraint on the parameters.\nB.\n\n\u03c7c0,2 \u2192 P P\n\nDecay channels of \u03c7c0,2 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b7, K + K \u2212 , Ks0 Ks0 and \u03c0\u03c0 have been measured at BES [1, 4, 5, 6]. However, as\nstudied in Ref. [26], the relatively large uncertainties with \u03c7c0 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b7 brought significant errors to parameter r, and\nthe role played by the DOZI processes cannot be clarified. It was shown in Ref. [26] that within the uncertainties\nof BR\u03c7c0 \u2192\u03b7\u03b7 = (2.1 \u00b1 1.1) \u00d7 10\u22123 [6], the relative branching ratios of \u03c7c0,2 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b7, \u03b7\u03b7 \u2032 and \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b7 \u2032 were very sensitive\nto the OZI-rule violation effects, and the branching ratio fractions can vary drastically. The world averaged data\nfor \u03c7c0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 , Ks0 Ks0 , and \u03c0\u03c0 [28] do not deviated significantly from the BES data [1, 4, 5, 6] except that\nBR\u03c7c0 \u2192\u03b7\u03b7 = (1.9 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10\u22123 has much smaller errors. Recently, CLEO-c publishes their results for \u03c7c0,2 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b7,\n\u03b7 \u2032 \u03b7 \u2032 and \u03b7\u03b7 \u2032 [7], with BR\u03c7c0 \u2192\u03b7\u03b7 = (3.1 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10\u22123 , BR\u03c7c0 \u2192\u03b7\u2032 \u03b7\u2032 = (1.7 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 10\u22123 and\nBR\u03c7c0 \u2192\u03b7\u03b7\u2032 < 0.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 . Upper limits are given for \u03c7c2 , i.e. BR\u03c7c2 \u2192\u03b7\u03b7 < 0.47 \u00d7 10\u22123 , BR\u03c7c2 \u2192\u03b7\u2032 \u03b7\u2032 < 0.31 \u00d7 10\u22123 ,\nand BR\u03c7c2 \u2192\u03b7\u03b7\u2032 < 0.23 \u00d7 10\u22123 .\nAdopting the world-average data from PDG [28] and including the new data from CLEO-c [7], we can now make\na constraint on the model parameters for \u03c7c0 \u2192 P P . We also make a fit for \u03c7c2 \u2192 P P in a similar way with the\nexperimental bound limits. The fitted parameters and branching ratios are listed in Table III and IV, respectively.\nIt shows that the decay of \u03c7c0 \u2192 P P can be described consistently with small \u03c72 . A prominent feature is that the\nSU(3) flavor symmetry breaking effects turn out to be small, i.e. R = 1.035 \u00b1 0.067 does not deviate significantly\nfrom unity. Meanwhile, parameter r = \u22120.120 \u00b1 0.044 suggests that contributions from the DOZI processes are not\nimportant. The production of \u03b7\u03b7 \u2032 is thus strongly suppressed which is consistent with CLEO-c results [7]. These\nfeatures indicate that pQCD transitions play a dominant role in P P decay channels.\nIn \u03c7c2 \u2192 P P , by fitting the PDG data and adopting the CLEO-c bound limits for \u03b7\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b7 \u2032 and \u03b7\u03b7 \u2032 , we obtain\nresults with large \u03c72 . Contrary to \u03c7c0 \u2192 P P , the fitted parameter R = 0.778 \u00b1 0.067 indicates significant SU(3) flavor\nsymmetry breakings. The OZI-rule violation parameter r = \u22120.216 \u00b1 0.102 also suggests that the DOZI processes\nare relatively more influential than in \u03c7c0 . However, this could be due to the poor status of the data. Notice that\n\n\f4\nBR\u03c7c2 \u2192K + K \u2212 = (0.77 \u00b1 0.14) \u00d7 10\u22123 and BR\u03c7c2 \u2192Ks0 Ks0 = (0.67 \u00b1 0.11) \u00d7 10\u22123 have violated the isospin relation\ndrastically. It needs further experiment to check whether this is due to datum inconsistency or unknown mechanisms.\nIt is interesting to see the change of the branching ratio average for K + K \u2212 in the past editions of PDG from 1998\n- 2006. PDG1998 quoted BR\u03c7c2 \u2192K + K \u2212 = (1.5 \u00b1 1.1) \u00d7 10\u22123 [29] which was measured by DASP Collaboration [30].\nIn PDG2000 [31], it was averaged to be BR\u03c7c2 \u2192K + K \u2212 = (0.81 \u00b1 0.19) \u00d7 10\u22123 with the measurement from BES\nCollaboration, (0.79\u00b10.14\u00b10.13)\u00d710\u22123 [4]. In PDG2004 [32], this branching ratio was revised to be BR\u03c7c2 \u2192K + K \u2212 =\n(0.94 \u00b1 0.17 \u00b1 0.13) \u00d7 10\u22123 by using BR(\u03c8(2S) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7c2 ) = (6.4 \u00b1 0.6)% and BR(\u03c8(2S) \u2192 J/\u03c8(1S)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) =\n0.317 \u00b1 0.011. Then, in PDG2006 [28], this quantity was revised again to be BR\u03c7c2 \u2192K + K \u2212 = (0.77 \u00b1 0.14) \u00d7 10\u22123, but\nwithout explicit explanations. In contrast to this is that the branching ratio for Ks0 Ks0 has not experienced drastic\nchanges. Further experimental investigation of these two channels will be necessary for understanding the \u03c7c2 \u2192 P P\ndecays.\nC.\n\n\u03c7c0,2 \u2192 SS\n\nThe scalar pair production \u03c7c0 \u2192 SS \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 K + K \u2212 is analyzed at BES [6]. The intermediate K0\u2217 K \u03040\u2217 pair\n+0.39\n) \u00d7 10\u22123 in its decay into \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 K + K \u2212 and a set of f0i f0j pairs are measured,\nhas a branching ratio of (1.05\n\u22120.30\nwhere i, j = 1, 2, 3 denotes f0 (1710), f0 (1500) and f0 (1370), respectively. The interesting feature is that the\nf0 (1370)f0(1710) pair production is found to have the largest branching ratio in comparison with other f0 pairs.\nTheoretical interpretation for such an observation is needed and in Ref. [26], a parametrization for the SOZI and\nDOZI processes suggests that glueball-q q\u0304 mixings can lead to an enhanced f0 (1370)f0 (1710) branching ratio in \u03c7c0\ndecays. However, due to the unavailability of the data for other scalar meson pair decays, estimate of the absolute\nbranching ratios were not possible. Here, incorporated by the data for K0\u2217 (1430)K\u03040\u2217(1430), we expect to have more\nquantitative estimates of the \u03c7c0,2 \u2192 SS branching ratios.\nTo proceed, several issues have to be addressed:\ni) The scalars, f0 (1370), f0 (1500) and f0 (1710), are assumed to be mixing states between scalar q q\u0304 and glueball G.\nOn the flavor singlet basis, the state mixing can be expressed as\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n|f0 (1710)i\n|Gi\n|Gi\nx1 y1 z1\n\uf8ed |f0 (1500)i \uf8f8 = U \uf8ed |ss\u0304i \uf8f8 = \uf8ed x2 y2 z2 \uf8f8 \uf8ed |ss\u0304i \uf8f8 ,\n(10)\n|f0 (1370)i\n|nn\u0304i\n|nn\u0304i\nx3 y3 z3\nwhere xi , yi and zi are the mixing matrix elements determined by the perturbation transitions [33, 34, 35]. We adopt\nthe mixing matrix U from Ref. [35]:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0.36 0.93 0.09\nU = \uf8ed \u22120.84 0.35 \u22120.41 \uf8f8 .\n(11)\n0.40 \u22120.07 \u22120.91\nIn order to examine the sensitivities of the branching ratios to the scalar meson structures in the numerical calculations,\nwe will also apply several other mixing schemes [36, 37, 38] which are different from Ref. [35].\nii) In \u03c7c0,2 \u2192 V V and P P the SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking turns to be at a magnitude of 10\u223c 20%. Namely,\nthe deviation of the SU(3) flavor symmetry parameter R from unity is small. Due to lack of data we assume that a\nsimilar order of magnitude of the SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking appears in \u03c7c0 \u2192 SS, and it is natural to assume\nR = 1 as a leading order estimate.\nWe can thus determine the basic transition strength g0 via\n\u0393(\u03c7c0 \u2192 K0\u2217 K \u03040\u2217 ) =\n\n|p|g04 R2 F (|p|)\n,\n4\u03c0M\u03c72c0\n\n(12)\n\nwhere p is the three-vector momentum of the final state K0\u2217 in the \u03c7c0 -rest frame, and F (|p|) is the form factor for\nthe relative l-wave two-body decay. The partial decay width \u0393(\u03c7c0 \u2192 K0\u2217 K \u03040\u2217 ) has been measured by BES [6]:\n+3.05\n) \u00d7 10\u22124 ,\nBR(\u03c7c0 \u2192 K0\u2217 K \u03040\u2217 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 K + K \u2212 ) = (10.44 \u00b1 1.57\n\u22121.90\n\n(13)\n\nwith BR(K0\u2217 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 ) = BR(K \u03040\u2217 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) = 0.465 [28].\niii) Since there is no constraint on the parameter t, we apply the flavor-blind assumption, t = 1, as a leading order\napproximation.\n\n\f5\niv) In order to accommodate the BES data [6], we adopt the same branching ratios for f0 \u2192 P P as used in Ref. [35]:\nBR(f0 (1710) \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0)\nBR(f0 (1500) \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0)\nBR(f0 (1500) \u2192 K K\u0304)\nBR(f0 (1370) \u2192 K K\u0304)\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n0.11 \u00d7 BR(f0 (1710) \u2192 K K\u0304) = 0.11 \u00d7 0.6 ,\n0.349 ,\n0.086 ,\n0.1 \u00d7 BR(f0 (1370) \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0) = 0.1 \u00d7 0.2 .\n\n(14)\n(15)\n(16)\n(17)\n\nIt should be noted that the final predictions for \u03c7c0 \u2192 f0i f0j \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 K + K \u2212 are sensitive to the above branching\nratios. For the charged decay channel, factor 1/2 and 2/3 will be included in the branching ratio of f0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 and\n\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , respectively. Detailed analysis of the f0 states can be found in Ref. [39] and references therein.\nNow, we are left with only one undetermined parameter r. By taking the measured branching ratio [6]:\nBR(\u03c7c0 \u2192 f0 (1370)f0(1710))*BR(f0 (1370) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )*BR(f0 (1710) \u2192 K + K \u2212 ) = (7.12 \u00b1 1.46\n\n+3.28\n)\u00d7 10\u22124 , (18)\n\u22121.68\n\nwe determine r = 1.31 \u00b1 0.19. Consequently, predictions for other SS decay channels can be made and the results\nare listed in Table V.\nA remarkable feature arising from the prediction is that BR(\u03c7c0 \u2192 f0 (1370)f0(1710)) turns out to be the largest\none in all the f0 pair productions with the constraint from K0\u2217 (1430)K\u03040\u2217(1430). As listed in Table V branching ratios of\nf0 (1370)f0(1370) and f0 (1370)f0(1500) are at order of 1%. Their signals in \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 K + K \u2212 are suppressed due to their\nsmall branching ratios to \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and K + K \u2212 [40, 41, 42]. As a comparison decay channels with f0 (1710) \u2192 K + K \u2212\nare less suppressed. Apart from the dominant channel f0 (1370)f0(1710), our calculation shows that \u03c7c0 has also large\nbranching ratios into \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 K + K \u2212 via f0 (1500)f0 (1710). It shows that our results for \u03c7c0 \u2192 f0i f0j \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 K + K \u2212\nprovide a consistent interpretation for the BES data [6] though some of the predictions strongly depend on the\nestimates of the branching ratios of f0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and K + K \u2212 .\nThe value of r = 1.31 \u00b1 0.19 suggests an important contribution from the DOZI processes in \u03c7c0 \u2192 f0i f0j , which is\nvery different from the results in V V and P P channels. This certainly depends on the mixing matrix for the scalars,\nand also correlated with parameters R and t. At this moment, we still lack sufficient experimental information to\nconstrain these parameters simultaneously. But it is worth noting that large contributions from the DOZI processes\nare also found in the interpretation [35] of the data for J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c9f0 (1710), \u03c6f0 (1710), \u03c9f0 (1370) and \u03c6f0 (1370) [41, 42].\nThe branching ratio for f0 (1710) recoiled by \u03c9 in the J/\u03c8 decays is found to be larger than it being recoiled by \u03c6, while\nbranching ratio for \u03c6f0 (1370) is larger than \u03c9f0 (1370). Since f0 (1710) is coupled to K K\u0304 strongly and f0 (1370) prefers\nto couple to \u03c0\u03c0 than K K\u0304, a simple assumption for these two states is that f0 (1710) and f0 (1370) are dominated by\nss\u0304 and nn\u0304, respectively. Due to this, one would expect that their production via SOZI processes should be dominant,\ni.e. BR(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6f0 (1710)) > BR(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c9f0 (1710)) and BR(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c9f0 (1370)) > BR(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6f0 (1370)).\nSurprisingly, the data do not favor such a prescription. In Ref. [35], we find that a glueball-q q\u0304 mixing can explain the\nscalar meson decay pattern with a strong contribution from the DOZI processes. In fact, this should not be out of\nexpectation if glueball-q q\u0304 mixing occurs in the scalar sector.\nWe compute two additional decay channels for \u03c7c0 \u2192 f0i f0j , i.e. \u03c7c0 \u2192 f0i f0j \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and K + K \u2212 K + K \u2212 ,\nwhich can be examined in experiment. The results are listed in the last two columns of Table V. It shows that the\nlargest decay in the 4\u03c0 channel is via f0 (1370)f0(1500), and the smallest channel is via f0 (1500)f0(1710). Branching\nratios are at order of 10\u22124 , the same as the dominant f0 (1370)f0(1500) channel. This means that an improved\nmeasurement will allow access to most of those intermediate states if the prescription is correct. In contrast, decays\ninto four kaons are dominantly via f0 (1500)f0(1710) and f0 (1370)f0 (1710) at order of 10\u22125 , while all the others are\nsignificantly suppressed. The branching ratio pattern can, in principle, be examined by future experiment, e.g. at\nBESIII with much increased statistics. Nonetheless, uncertainties arising from the f0 \u2192 P P decays can be reduced.\nIt should be noted that our treatment for the SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking in order to reduce the number of\nfree parameters can be checked by measuring \u03c7c0 \u2192 a0 (1450)a0 (1450). In the SU(3) symmetry limit, we predict\nBR\u03c7c0 \u2192a0 (1450)a0 (1450) = 5.60 \u00d7 10\u22123 , which is not independent of K0\u2217 (1430)K \u03040\u2217 (1430). Experimental information\nabout this channel will be extremely valuable for clarifying the role played by the DOZI processes.\nIn order to examine how this model depends on the scalar mixings, and learn more about the scalar meson structures,\nwe apply another two mixing schemes from different approaches and compute the branching ratios for \u03c7c0 \u2192 f0i f0j \u2192\n\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 K + K \u2212 , \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and K + K \u2212 K + K \u2212 . The first one is from Ref. [36] by Cheng et al. (Model-CCL) based\non quenched lattice QCD calculations for the glueball spectrum, and the second one is from Ref. [37] by Giacosa et\nal. (Model-GGLF) in an effective chiral approach. We note that the mixing scheme of Ref. [38] with the truncated\nmixing matrix for the glueball and q q\u0304 part gives a similar result as Eq. (11).\n\n\f6\nIn model-CCL, the mix matrix was given as\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n0.859 0.302 0.413\nU = \uf8ed \u22120.128 0.908 \u22120.399 \uf8f8 .\n\u22120.495 0.290 0.819\n\n(19)\n\nWith the data from Eqs. (13) and (18), we determine r = 0.90 \u00b1 0.21. Predictions for other decay channels are given\nin Table VI.\nIn Model-GGLF, four mixing solutions were provided. We apply the first two as an illustration of the effects from\nthe mixing schemes. The Solution-I gives\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u22120.06 0.97 \u22120.24\nU = \uf8ed 0.89 \u22120.06 \u22120.45 \uf8f8 ,\n(20)\n0.45 0.24 0.86\nand Solution-II reads\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\u22120.68 0.67 \u22120.30\nU = \uf8ed 0.49 0.72 \u22120.49 \uf8f8 .\n0.54 0.19 0.81\n\n(21)\n\nWe then determine r = 1.93 \u00b1 0.29 and r = \u22122.07 \u00b1 0.79 for Solution-I and II, respectively. The predictions for the\nbranching ratios are listed in Tables VII and VIII.\nAmong all these outputs the most predominant feature is that large DOZI contributions are needed to explain\nthe available data for \u03c7c0 \u2192 f0 (1370)f0 (1710) and \u03c7c0 \u2192 K0\u2217 (1430)K\u03040\u2217(1430). This also leads to the result that\n\u03c7c0 \u2192 f0 (1370)f0(1710) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 K + K \u2212 is a dominant decay channel. Thinking that all these scalar mixing schemes\nhave quite different mixing matrix elements, the dominance of f0 (1370)f0 (1710) gives an impression that the SS\nbranching ratios are not sensitive to the scalar wavefunctions. However, this is not the case, we note that the data\ncannot be explained if f0 (1710) is nearly pure glueball while f0 (1500) a pure ss\u0304, namely, a mixing such as shown by\nthe fourth solution of Ref. [37].\nIt turns more practical to extract information about the scalar structures in an overall study of the SS branching\nratio pattern arising from \u03c7c0 \u2192 SS \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 K + K \u2212 , 4\u03c0 and 4K. For instance, in the \u03c7c0 \u2192 SS \u2192 4K, the dominant\nchannels are predicted to be via f0 (1370)f0 (1710) and f0 (1500)f0 (1710) in the mixing of Eq. (11), while in the other\nmodels the f0 (1500)f0(1710) channel turns out to be small. In contrast, the f0 (1370)f0 (1370) channel is dominant in\n4\u03c0 channel as predicted by Solution-II of Model-GGLF, while it is compatible with other channels in other solutions.\nSystematic analysis of these decay channels should be helpful for pinning down the glueball-q q\u0304 mixings.\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nA systematic investigation of \u03c7c0,2 \u2192 V V , P P and SS in a general parametrization scheme is presented in line\nwith the new data from BES and CLEO-c. It shows that the exclusive hadronic decays of the \u03c7c0,2 are rich of\ninformation about the roles played by the OZI-rule violations and SU(3) flavour breakings in the decay transitions.\nFor \u03c7c0,2 \u2192 V V and P P , we obtain an overall self-contained description of the experimental data. Contributions\nfrom the DOZI processes turn out to be suppressed. For the channels with better experimental measurement, i.e.\n\u03c7c0,2 \u2192 V V , and \u03c7c0 \u2192 P P , the SU(3) flavor symmetry is also better respected. Significant SU(3) breaking turns\nup in \u03c7c2 \u2192 P P which is likely due to the poor status of the experimental data and future measurement at BESIII\nand CLEO-c will be crucial to disentangle this.\nThe BES data for \u03c7c0 \u2192 SS allows us to make a quantitative analysis of the branching ratios in the scalar meson\ndecay channel. In particular, it allows a test of the scalar f0 mixings motivated by the scalar glueball-q q\u0304 mixing\nscenario. Including the new data for \u03c7c0 \u2192 K0\u2217 K \u03040\u2217 from BES Collaboration, we find that the decay of \u03c7c0 \u2192 f0i f0j\nfavors strong contributions from the DOZI processes. This phenomenon is consistent with what observed in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6f0i\nand \u03c9f0i [41, 42], where large contributions from the DOZI processes are also favored [35]. The SS decay branching\nratio pattern turns out to be sensitive to the scalar mixing schemes. An overall study of \u03c7c0 \u2192 SS \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 K + K \u2212 ,\n4\u03c0 and 4K may be useful for us to gain some insights into the scalar meson structures and extract more information\nabout the glueball signals in its production channel.\n\n\f7\nAcknowledgement\n\nUseful discussions with C.Z.
