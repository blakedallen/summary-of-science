It occurs due to the magnetic field of the\nplasma solar wind sweeping some of the galactic cosmic rays away from earth. The term\nForbush decrease was named after the American physicist Scott E. Forbush, who studied\ncosmic rays in the 1930s and 1940s. The Forbush decrease is usually observed by particle\ndetectors on Earth within a few days after the CME, and the decrease takes place over the\nfollowing several days, the solar cosmic ray intensity returns to normal. Forbush\ndecreases have also been observed by humans on Mir and the International Space Station\n(ISS) and by instruments onboard Pioneer 10 and 11 and Voyager 1 and 2, even past of\nthe orbit of Neptune. The magnitude of a Forbush decrease depends on three factors:\n\n\f(i) The size of the CME\n(ii) The strength of the magnetic fields in the CME\n(iii) The proximity of the CME to the Earth.\nA Forbush decrease is sometimes defined as being a decrease of at least 10% of galactic\ncosmic rays on Earth, but ranges from about 3% to 20%. Reductions of 30% or more\nhave been recorded a board the ISS. The overall rate of Forbush decrease tends to follow\nthe 11-year sunspot cycle.\nApplications of wavelets and multiresolution analysis to reaction engineering system\nfrom the point of view of process monitoring, fault detection, system analysis and so on,\nis an important topic and of current research interest [1]. The presence of noise in a time\nseries data restricts one significantly to have meaningful information from the data. Noise\nin experimental data can also cause misleading conclusions [2]. Donoho and Johnstone\n[3] introduced two types of Denoising: linear denoising and nonlinear denoising. In linear\ndenoising noise is assumed to be concentrated only on fine scales and that all the wavelet\ncoefficients below these scales are cut off. Nonlinear denoising, on the other hand, treats\nnoise reduction by either cutting off all coefficients below a certain threshold or reducing\nall coefficients by this threshold [1, 3]. The threshold values are obtained by statistical\ncalculations and have been seen to depend on the standard deviation of the noise [4]. Ray\net al [1] proposed a denoising algorithm making use of the discrete analogue of the\nWavelet Transform (WT), which in many ways complements the well-known Fourier\nTransform (FT) procedure. The unique part of this proposal is that in this noise-reduction\nalgorithm the threshold level for noise is identified automatically.\nThe detection of the peaks in a time series data does not completely serve our purpose.\nFurther analysis is required to analyze the confidence levels of the obtained peaks to\nclassify the strong peaks and weak peaks. We here modify the Integral Method in\nconnection to this view using the idea developed by Azzini et al [5].\nWe have used this Simple Denoising Algorithm on the daily Forbush decrease data\ndemonstrated in two series from the year 1967 to 2003 from Eroshenko et al [6]. Graphs\nare plotted to depict the periodic nature of the Forbush decrease data and the\ncorresponding periodicities with levels of confidence are calculated.\nTHEORY:\na) ALGORITHM BASED ON DISCRETE WAVELET TRANSFORM:\nThe noise-reduction algorithm consists of the following steps [1]:\nStep 1: In the first step, we differentiate the noisy signal x(t) to obtain the data xd(t), [1,\n7] i.e.\nxd(t)=dx(t)/dt\n(1)\nStep 2: We then take the Discrete Wavelet Transform of the data xd(t) and obtain wavelet\ncoefficients Wj,k at various dyadic scales j and displacements k. A dyadic scale is the\nscale whose numerical magnitude is equal to 2, rose to an integer exponent and is labelled\nby the exponent. Thus the dyadic scale j refers to a scale of size 2j. In other words, it\nindicates a resolution of 2j data points. Thus a low value of j implies a finer resolution,\nwhile high j analyzes the signal at a larger resolution. This transform is the discrete\nanalogue of continuous Wavelet Transform [1, 8] and it can be represented by the\nfollowing formula\n\n\f\u221e\nWj,k=\u222bxd(t)\u03a8j,k(t)dt\n-\u221e\n\n(2)\n\nwith\n\u03a8j,k(t)= 2j/2\u03a8(2jt-k)\nwhere j, k are integers.\nTaking the above formula (2) in a discrete sense and using (1) we have for n number of\nobservations occurring at equal time intervals at t=1, 2, 3, ...., n in which we have taken\nan appropriate time scale where the length of the equal time interval is taken to be unity:\nn\n(3)\nWj,k=x(n)\u03a8j,k(n)-x(1)\u03a8j,k(1)- \u2211x(t) \u03a8j,k/(t)\nt=1\nAs for the wavelet function \u03a8(t), we have chosen Daubechies' compactly supported\northogonal function with four filter coefficients [9, 10].\nStep 3: In this step we estimate the power Pj [1] contained in different dyadic scales j,\nvia\n(j=1, 2, ....)\n(4)\nPj(x)=\u2211\u202b\u05c0\u202cWj,k\u202b\u05c0\u202c2\nk\nBy plotting the variation of Pj with j, we see that it is possible to identify a scale jm at\nwhich the power due to noise falls of rapidly. This is important because it provides an\nautomated means of detecting the threshold. Identification of the scale jm at which the\npower due to noise shows the first minimum allows us to reset all Wj,k up to scale index\njm to zero, that is Wj,k=0, for j=1, 2,...., jm [1].\n^\nStep 4: In the fourth step, we reconstruct the denoised data xd(t) by taking the inverse\ntransform of the coefficients Wj,k\n^\nxd(t)= \u2211 \u2211 Wj,k \u03a8j,k(t)\n(5)\nj k\n^\nThis set of obtained xd(t) gives measure of time variation in the signal. Upon\ndifferentiation the contribution due to white noise moves towards the finer scales because\nthe process of differentiation converts the uncorrelated stochastic process to a first\norder moving average process and thereby distributes more energy to finer scales [1].\n^\nFinally we plot the graph of xd(t) vs. t to obtain the corresponding peaks.\n\n\fb) INTEGRAL METHOD TO DETERMINE THE CONFIDENCE LEVELS OF\nPEAKS:\n^\nThe obtained xd's are processed for their corresponding confidence levels by this method\n[5]. First we make,\nm ^\n\u2211\u239cxd(Ti)\u239c=A1\n(6)\ni=1\nwhere m is the total number of trial periods Ti taken for analysis.\nWe take,\n^\n^\n^\n^\n(7)\n\u2206xd(Ti)/\u2206Ti=[xd(Ti+1)- xd (Ti)]/( Ti+1- Ti )= \u22061 xd (Ti)\n^\nWe take \u03c4 as the time Tj where \u22061 xd (Ti) is maximum. That means,\n^\n\u03c4=argmax[xd(Ti)]\n(8)\nNext we consider\nj+2 ^\nA2=\u2211\u239cxd(Tk)\u239c\n(9)\nk=j-2\nFinally we set the ratio\nS0=(A2/A1)x100\n(10)\nThe value of S0 gives the corresponding confidence level in percentage for the peak. The\nhigher the score S0 the higher is the probability to find a significant peak with respect to\naverage signal amplitude.\nIn the first step we proceed by the above manner to determine the confidence level for the\n^\npeak, where \u22061 xd (Ti) is maximum.\n^\n^\nCompleting the analysis next we make a shift of xd at the second highest value of \u22061 xd\n(Ti) and proceed in the same way to determine the confidence level for the corresponding\npeak. Continuing the process we can find the confidence levels for all the possible peaks\nfor our discussion.\nRESULTS:\nFor numerical simulation we take j=1, 2, ...., 5 and k=1, 2, ...., 5. Calculations yield\ndifferent periodicities for the two series of daily data of Forbush effects [6] in the present\nanalysis. An interesting observation for the presently considered algorithm is that the\nmethod has a tendency to locate the periods in comparatively larger time scale. So we\nsearch for the initial peaks of the Forbush decrease data by taking the initial time range as\na whole and then restudy the case to obtain the initial peaks. Corresponding confidence\nlevels are also calculated for the obtained peaks.

The period of 5.60 (99.89% CL) years obtained here\nfor both the series of Forbush decrease data is not appreciably different from 4.75 years\nfound for Forbush decrease and solar flare data [11] and 5.0 years for solar proton event\ndata [11]. Ghosh and Raychaudhuri [12] obtained almost similar period of 5.803 years for\ncombined GALLEX-GNO solar neutrino flux data during May 1991 to December 2001.\nThus the common periodicity of around 5 to 6 years in the solar neutrino flux data along\nwith Forbush decrease data with corresponding solar flare data and major solar proton\nevent data suggest that they are inter related and that a pulsating solar core may be their\ncommon origin [13, 14].\nREFERENCES:\n[1] Roy, M., Kumar, V.R., Kulkarni, B.D., Sanderson, J., Rhodes, M. and Stappen, M.V.,\nAIChE Jour., 45 (11), 2461 (1999).\n[2] Grassberger, P., Schreiber, T. and Schaffrath, C., Int.
