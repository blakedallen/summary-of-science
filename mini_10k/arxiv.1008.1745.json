Introduction\nUnless stated otherwise, X \u0592\u2192 Pr will be a nonsingular connected projective\nvariety of dimension n > 0. Let UX denote its universal covering. Recall that the\nfundamental group \u03c01 (X) is large if and only if UX contains no proper holomorphic\nsubsets of positive dimension (Koll\u00e1r [Kol]).\nConjecture (Shafarevich, 1972). The universal covering of any nonsingular\nconnected projective variety of dimension n > 0 with large fundamental group is a\nStein manifold.\nThe aim of this note is to prove the following\nTheorem. If \u03c01 (X) is, in addition, residually finite then UX is a Stein manifold.\nIn the sequel, we will assume that \u03c01 (X) is residually finite.\nThe conjecture attracted a great deal of attention, and recently it became a central problem in complex algebraic geometry. It is already known in several special\ncases (see Koll\u00e1r [Kol] and references therein). On the other hand, Bogomolov\nand Katzarkov suggested that the conjecture might fail in the case of nonresidually\nfinite fundamental groups [BK].\nIn Section 5, we will prove the theorem under an additional assumption that\na general curvilinear section C \u2282 X has the genus g(C) \u2265 2 because, otherwise,\n\u03c01 (X) is Abelian by the Campana-Deligne theorem [Kol, Theorem 2.14], and the\nconjecture is well known when \u03c01 (X) is Abelian or, even, nilpotent (Katzarkov\n[Ka]).\nThe idea of proof of the theorem is similar to the one by Siegel [S]. He established that if U is a connected bounded domain in Cn covering a compact complex\nmanifold Y then U is a domain of holomorphy. We will sketch his argument.\nHe considers the Bergman metric on U (see, e.g., [Kob1], [Kob2, Chap. 4.10]). It\nis complete since Y is compact. Recall the fundamental property of the Bergman\nmetric, namely, it defines a natural isometric embedding of U into an infinitedimensional projective space with a Fubini-Study metric. Infinite-dimensional projective spaces spaces were considered by Bochner [B], Calabi [C, Chap. 4] and\nKobayashi [Kob1, Sect. 7]. The idea of using square-integrable forms on arbitrary\nmanifolds can be found in Washnitzer [W].\nLet B(z, z\u0304) denote the Bergman kernel of U . Siegel proves that log B(z, z\u0304) goes\nto infinity on any infinite discrete subset T \u2282 U . See also [Kob1, Theorem 9.5];\nKobayashi observed in [Kob1, p. 267] that his condition A.4 ([Kob1, p. 284] and\n[Kob2, p. 233, (C)]) is stronger than limu\u2208T,u\u2192\u016a \\U log B(z(u), z\u0304(u)) = \u221e. Hence U\n\n\fis a domain of holomorphy (equivalently, holomorphically compete or Stein domain)\nby Oka's solution of the Levi problem.\nWe observe that Y is a projective variety by the Poincar\u00e9 ampleness theorem\n[Kol, Theorem 5.22]. In 1950s, Bremermann proved that an arbitrary bounded\ndomain in Cn with complete Bergman metric is Stein [Kob2, Theorem 4.10.21].\nNow, Oka's solution of the Levi problem for domains in Cn admits a generalization due to Grauert (manifolds) and Narasimhan (complex spaces) (see [N]). Thus,\nour aim is to define a metric on the manifold UX and a strictly plurisubharmonic\nfunction on UX that goes to infinity on an arbitrary infinite discrete subset of UX .\nThe function generated by the diastasic potentials of the metric will be such a\nfunction.\n2. Diastasis\nThe diastasis was introduced by Calabi [C, Chap. 2]. Let M denote a complex\nmanifold with real analytic Kahler metric. Let \u03a6 denote a real analytic potential\nof the metric defined in a small neighborhood V \u2282 M . Let z = (z1 , . . . , zn ) be a\ncoordinate system in V and z\u0304 = (z\u03041 , . . . , z\u0304n ) a coordinate system in its conjugate\nneighborhood V\u0304 \u2282 M\u0304 . Let (p, p) be a point on the diagonal of M \u00d7 M\u0304 such that\nthe neighborhood V \u00d7 V\u0304 \u2282 M \u00d7 M\u0304 contains the point.\nThere exists a unique holomorphic function F on an open neighborhood of (p, p)\nsuch that F(p,p) = \u03a6p . Here \u03a6p is the germ at p \u2208 M of our real analytic function,\nand F(p,p) is the germ of the corresponding holomorphic function (complexification\nof \u03a6p [C, Chap. 2], [U, Appendix]). One considers the sheaf AR\nM of germs of real anC\nalytic functions on M , and the sheaf AM \u00d7M\u0304 of germs of complex holomorphic funcC\ntions on M \u00d7 M\u0304 . For each p \u2208 M , we get a natural inclusion AR\nM,p \u0592\u2192 AM \u00d7M\u0304 ,(p,p) ,\ncalled a complexification. The above equality is understood in this sense.\nLet p and q be two arbitrary points of V with coordinates z(p) and z(q). Let\nF (z(p), z(q)) denote the corresponding complex holomorphic function on V \u00d7 V\u0304.\nThe functional element of diastasis is defined as follows:\nDM (p, q) := F (z(p), z(p)) + F (z(q), z(q)) \u2212 F (z(p), z(q)) \u2212 F (z(q), z(p)).\nWe get the germ DM (p, q) \u2208 AC\n, and DM (p, q) is uniquely determined by\nM \u00d7M\u0304 ,(p,q)\nthe Kahler metric, symmetric in p and q and real valued [C, Prop. 1, 2]. The real\nanalytic function generated by the above functional element is called the diastasis\n[C, p. 3]. The diastasis approximates the square of the geodesic\nPrdistance in the small\nr\n[C, p. 4]. For C with its unitary coordinates, DCr (p, q) = i=1 |zi (q) \u2212 zi (p)|2 .\nThe fundamental property of the diastasis is that it is inductive on complex\nsubmanifolds [C, Chap. 2, Prop. 6]. Another observation by Calabi [C, Note on\np. 4] is that DM (p, q) represents the original functional element of the diastasis,\nand not values obtained from its maximal analytic continuation.\nNow, let q \u2208 M be a fixed point, and z = (z1 , . . . , zn ) a local coordinate system\nin a small neighborhood Vq \u2282 M with origin at q. The real analytic function\n\u03a6\u0303q (z(p), z(p)) := DM (q, p) on Vq is called the diastasic potential at q of the Kahler\nmetric. It is strictly plurisubharmonic function in p [C, Chap. 2, Prop. 4].\nThe prolongation over M of the germ of diastasic potential \u03a6\u0303q (z(p), z(p)) at q\nis a function PM := PM,q \u2208 H 0 (AR\nM , M ) such that, for every u \u2208 M , PM (u)\ncoincides with DM (q, u) meaning DM (q, u), initially defined in a neighborhood of\n2\n\n\fq, can be extended to the whole M . Moreover, the germ of PM at u is the diastasic\npotential of our metric at u (see (5.1) below).\nClearly, the prolongation over M is not always possible. Now, let PN be a\nprojective space with the Fubini-Study metric. For q \u2208 PN , we consider Bochner\ncanonical coordinates z1 , . . . , zN with origin at q on the complement of a hyperplane\n\u0001\nPN\nat infinity. By Calabi [Chap. 4, (27)], DPr (q, p) = log 1 + \u03c3=1 |z\u03c3 (p)|2 . In the\nhomogeneous coordinates \u03be0 , . . . , \u03beN , where z\u03c3 := \u03be\u03c3 /\u03be0 , we get\nPN\n|\u03be\u03c3 (p)|2\nDPN (q, p) = log \u03c3=0\n.\n|\u03be0 (p)|2\nOn the other hand, let U \u2282 Cn be a bounded domain. Let z1 , . . . , zn be a local\nsystem of coordinates with origin at a point q \u2208 U . By the characteristic property\nof the diastasic potential (vanishing of some partial derivatives; see [B, pp. 180-181],\n[C, p. 3, p. 14], and [U, Appendix] where this property is explicitly stated):\n\u2202 |I| PU,q (q)/\u2202zI = \u2202 |I| PU,q (q)/\u2202 z\u0304I = 0 (I := {i1 , . . . , in } where i1 , . . . , in \u2265 0),\nwe get log B(z, z\u0304) is the diastasic potential at q of the Bergman metric on U . Thus,\nPU,q = log B(z, z\u0304) and it is defined over the whole U , namely, PU,q (u) = DU (q, u).\n3. Bergman-type metrics in tower of coverings\nIn this section, we will establish a version of a statement attributed to Kazhdan\nby Yau [Y, p. 139]. For a survey of known results and historical remarks, see a recent\narticle by Ohsawa [O, Sect. 5]. In fact, Kazhdan had not presented a proof. In case\nUX is the disk \u2206, the first proof was given by Rhodes [R]. Recently, McMullen has\ngiven a short proof for the disk [M, Appendix].\n(3.1) We consider a tower of Galois coverings with each Gal(Xi /X) a finite group:\n\\\n(3.1.1) X = X0 \u2190 X1 \u2190 X2 \u2190 * * * \u2190 U,\nGal(U/Xi ) = {1} (0 \u2264 i < \u221e).\ni\n\nWe do not assume U is simply connected. Let \u03c4i denote the projection U \u2192 Xi ,\n\u03c4 := \u03c40 , and \u03c4jk denote the projection Xj \u2192 Xk (j \u2265 k).\nThe hyperplane bundle on Pr restricts to LX , called a polarization on X. Given\nour polarized Kahler metric g on X, one can find a Hermitian metric h on LX with\nits Ricci curvature form equal to the corresponding Kahler form \u03c9g .\nWe consider the volume form\nof the Kahler form \u03c9g . In local coordinates\nQn \u221a\nz1 , . . . , zn on X, dvg = Vg \u03b1=1 ( \u22121*dz\u03b1\u2227dz\u0304\u03b1 ) where Vg is a positive function. We\nwill employ the same volume form on all the coverings of X. Also, we will employ\n\u2217\nthe same Hermitian metric on all \u03c4j0\n(LX ).\n(3.2) Positive reproducing kernels and Bergman pseudometrics. The fundamental\nproperty of any Berman-type pseudometric is the existence of a natural continuous\nmap to a suitable projective space P(H \u2217 ) where the corresponding Hilbert space\nH has a reproducing kernel.\n(3.2.1) Let M denote an arbitrary complex manifold. Let B(z, w) be a Hermitian\npositive definite complex-valued function on M \u00d7 M which means:\n(i) B(z, w) = B(w, z),\nB(z, z) \u2265 0;\nPN\n(ii) \u2200z1 , . . . , zN \u2208 M, \u2200a1 , . . . , aN \u2208 C =\u21d2\nj,k B(zk , zj )aj \u0101k \u2265 0.\n3\n\n\fIf B(z, w) is, in addition, holomorphic in the first variable then B is the reproducing\nkernel of a unique Hilbert space H of holomorphic functions on U (see Aronszajn [A,\np. 344,(4)] and the articles by Faraut and Kor\u00e1nyi in [FK, pp. 5-14, pp. 187-191]).\nThe evaluation at a point Q \u2208 M, eQ : f 7\u2192 f (Q), is a continuous linear functional\non H.\n(3.2.2) Conversely, given a Hilbert space H (H 6= 0) of holomorphic functions\non M with all evaluation maps continuous linear functionals then, by the Riesz\nrepresentation theorem, for every w \u2208 M there exists a unique function Bw \u2208 H\nsuch that f (w) = hf, Bw i (\u2200f \u2208 H) and B(z, w) := Bw (z) is the reproducing kernel\nof H (which is Hermitian positive definite).\nIf we assume, in addition, that B(z, z) > 0 for every z then we can define\nlog B(z, z) and a positive semidefinite Hermitian form, called the Bergman pseudometric\nX\n\u2202 2 log B(z, z)\n.\nds2M = 2\ngjk dzj dz k ,\ngjk :=\n\u2202zj \u2202z k\n\nWe get a natural map \u03a5 : M \u2212\u2192 P(H \u2217 ) whose image does not belong to a proper\nsubspace of P(H \u2217 ) as in [Kob2, Chap. 4.10, pp. 224-228]. As in [Kol, Chap. 7,\npp. 81-84, Lemma-Definition 7.2], the function B(z, w) can be replaced by a section\nof a relevant bundle.\n(3.3) Assuming KX is ample, we fix a large integer t such that for every i, KtXi is\nvery ample (see [Kol, 16.5]). The bundle KtXi is equipped with a Hermitian metric\nhKtX := htKX , where hKXi is the Hermitian metric on KXi [Kol, 5.12, 5.13, 7.1.1].\ni\ni\nAlso, the bundle KtU is equipped with a Hermitian metric.\nFurther, let \u03c80 , . . . , \u03c8N be an orthonormal basis of H 0 (X, Kt ) with respect to\ndvg and hKtX (see also (4.3.1) below). Locally \u03c8\u03b2 = g\u03b2 (z)(dz1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 dzn )t . We get\nan embedding \u03c3 : X \u0592\u2192 P(H 0 (X, K t)\u2217 ). We set\ndv\n\nX,Kt\n\n:=\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03b2=0\n\n|g\u03b2 |2\n\n\u0001 1t \u221a\n2\n( \u22121)n dz1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 dzn \u2227 dz\u03041 \u2227 * * * \u2227 dz\u0304n .\n\nThe associated Ricci form Ric(dvX,Kt ) is negative. If we pull back on X the FubiniStudy metric on P(H 0 (X, K t)\u2217 ) then its Kahler form differs only by the sign from\nRic(dvX,Kt ).\n(n,n)\n\n(3.3.1) Let \u03a9U\ndenote the bundle of (n, n)-forms. Let A ( U be a union of a\ncountable number of real analytic subsets. As in [Kol, Chap. 7.1.1.2], we fix a real\nhomomorphism of C \u221e -bundles defined outside A:\n(n,n)\n\nHU,t : KtU \u2297 K\u0304tU \u2192 \u03a9U\n\n\u2243 KU \u2297 K\u0304U .\n\nWe consider the Hilbert space H = HU of square-integrable holomorphic weight t\ndifferential forms \u03c9 on U . By square-integrable (or L2 ), we mean\nZ\nHU,t (\u03c9 \u2297 \u03c9\u0304) < \u221e.\nU\n\nWe assume H 6= 0. If all the evaluation maps are bounded (e.g., if H is defined\nas in (3.3.2) below) then H has a reproducing kernel as in the case of classical\nBergman metric [FK, pp. 8-10, pp. 187-188]. Further, if the natural map\nU \u2212\u2192 P(H \u2217 )\n4\n\n\fis a holomorphic embedding then the metric on U , induced from P(H \u2217 ), is called\nits t-Bergman metric. It is denoted by bU,t and the corresponding tensor is denoted\nby gU,Kt . Of course, they depend on the choice of HU,t .\nSimilarly, one defines the Euclidean space Vi of square-integrable holomorphic\nweight t differential forms on Xi . Let P(Vi\u2217 ) denote the corresponding projective\nspace with its Fubini-Study metric. If the natural map\nXi \u2212\u2192 P(Vi\u2217 )\nis a holomorphic embedding then the induced metric on Xi is called its t-Bergman\nmetric.\n(3.3.2) A sequence of homomorphisms HX,t , . . . , HXi ,t , . . . HU,t is said to be compatible with the tower (3.1.1) if and only if \u03c4i\u2217 HXi ,t = HU,t for all i \u2265 0.\nIn local coordinates, let \u03c9e = ge (dz1 \u2227* * *\u2227dzn )t be two weight t forms (e = 1, 2).\nLet \u03c2 be a suitable positive continuous function defined outside a subset A ( X,\nwhere A is a union of a countable number of real analytic subsets. We assume \u03c2 is\nbounded away from 0 on every compact subset of X. We consider inverse images of\n\u03c2 on all members of the tower. By abuse of notation, we denote the inverse images\nby the same symbol \u03c2. We can get a compatible sequence H.,t by setting\n\u221a\nn(n\u22121)\nH.,t (\u03c91 , \u03c92 ) := (\u22122 \u22121)\u2212n (\u22121) 2 \u03c2g1 \u1e212 dz1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 dzn \u2227 dz\u03041 \u2227 * * * \u2227 dz\u0304n .\nWe consider H.,t defined as above with a suitable \u03c2. The corresponding Hilbert\nspaces have reproducing kernels as in the case of classical weighted Bergman spaces.\nNow, we assume, in addition, LX \u2286 KtX . Given the volume form dvg and the\nHermitian metric h on LX , one can define an inner product on sections of H 0 (X, L)\nin two ways:\n\u2032\n\nh\u03c91 , \u03c92 i :=\n\nZ\n\nh(\u03c91 , \u03c9\u03042 )dvg\n\nand\n\nU\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\nh\u03c91 , \u03c92 i :=\n\nZ\n\nU\n\nHU,t (\u03c91 \u2297 \u03c9\u03042 ).\n\nAs in [Kol, Chap. 5.1] with obvious modifications, one can compare the corresponding norms. We have two Hilbert spaces with reproducing kernels, H \u2032 and H \u2032\u2032. The\nmetrics on U , induced from P((H \u2032 )\u2217 ) and P((H \u2032\u2032 )\u2217 ) respectively, will be equivalent.\n(3.3.3) Classical example. Let U := \u2206 \u2282 C be a disk. Let \u03c91 := g1 (z)(dz)t and\n\u03c92 := g2 (z)(dz)t be weight t holomorphic forms. With \u03bb\u2206 := (1 \u2212 |z|2 )\u22121 , we let\n(1,1)\n\nH\u2206,t : Kt\u2206 \u2297 K\u0304t\u2206 \u2212\u2192 \u03a9\u2206\n\n\u2243 K\u2206 \u2297 K\u0304\u2206 ,\n\ng1 (z)g2 (z)dz \u2227 dz\u0304.\n\u03c91 \u2297 \u03c9\u03042 7\u2192 \u03bb2\u22122t\n\u2206\n\nAs in (3.1.1), we consider a tower of Riemann surfaces. In view of the correspondence between automorphic functions on \u2206 and differential forms on Riemann\nsurfaces, we get the compatible sequence of homomorphisms H.,t .\nThe main result of this section is the following\n\nProposition 1. With the above notation, we assume that U and all Xi 's have the\nt-Bergman metrics for an integer t, and the H.,t 's, defined with a help of the above\n\u03c2, are compatible with the tower. Then the t-Bergman metric on U equals the limit\nof pullbacks of the t-Bergman metrics from Xi 's.\n5\n\n\fProof. Let bU,t denote the t-Bergman metric on U . Set b\u0303U,t := lim sup bi , where bi\nis the pullback on U of the t-Bergman metric on Xi .\nFirst, we get the inequality b\u0303U,t \u2264 bU,t . We consider an open exhaustion of U ,\nnamely: {U\u03bd \u2282 U, \u03bd = 1, 2, . . . }, where each \u016a\u03bd is compact and \u016a\u03bd \u2282 U\u03bd+1 . Let\nb(\u03bd) denote the t-Bergman metric on U\u03bd . It is well known that bU,t = lim\u03bd\u2192\u221e b(\u03bd).\nIndeed, a form is square-integrable on U if and only if it is square-integrable on\neach U\u03bd and the integrals are bounded. Given U\u03bd , the restriction of \u03c4i on U\u03bd is\none-to-one for i \u226b 0 because \u03c01 (X) is residually finite. Further, b(\u03bd) > bi |U\u03bd for\nall i > i(\u03bd). This establishes that b\u0303U,t \u2264 bU,t .\nWe have b\u0303U,t = lim bi . In the sequel, by a local map we mean a map of a\nneighborhood. The above discussion suggests the following argument.\nLet V be the completion of the Euclidean space E := \u222aVi . We will show that\nU , with the metric b\u0303U,t , can be naturally isometrically embedded in P(V \u2217 ) with its\nFubini-Study metric.\nLet p(w) \u2208 U be a point and \u03c9 = f (dw1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 dwn )t \u2208 H a form in local coordinates w = (w1 , . . . , wn ) around p(w). Recall that the bU,t -isometric embedding\nU \u0592\u2192 P(H \u2217 ) was given by the t-Bergman kernel section B := BU,Kt (we do not\nassume KtU is trivial). The map p(w) 7\u2192 hf, Bw i has defined the local bU,t -isometric\nholomorphic embedding U \u2192 P(H \u2217 ) (see [Kob1, Sect. 7], [FK, pp. 5-13 or p. 188])\nas well as the global bU,t -isometric holomorphic embedding.\nNow, let \u03c9 = f (dw1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 dwn )t be a form on U that is the pullback of a\nform on Vi . As above, one can locally define the map p(w) 7\u2192 hf, Bw i because\nB = lim\u03bd\u2192\u221e B(\u03bd) [A, Part I, Sect. 9]. The above map yields a local bi -isometric\nholomorphic map U \u2192 P(Vi\u2217 ). Hence we get a local b\u0303U,t -isometric holomorphic\nembedding U \u0592\u2192 P(V \u2217 ) (see [FK, Prop. I.1.6 on p. 13]).\nThe local b\u0303U,t -isometric holomorphic embedding yields the global one. To show\nit, we use that \u03c01 (X) is residually finite. Indeed, the local embedding can be\nextended along a path [C, Theorem 9]. Since two paths with the same end points\nbelong to a compact subset of U that projects one-to-one to Xi for \u2200i \u226b 0, we get\nthe same result after extensions.\nClearly, U with the metric bU,t is P(H \u2217 )-resolvable at a point p (1-resolvable of\nrank N = \u221e in Calabi's terminology [C, p. 19, Definition]), i.e, the image of U\ndoes not lie in a proper subspace of P(H \u2217 ).\nSimilarly, U with the metric b\u0303U,t is P(V \u2217 )-resolvable at p. By the construction\nof U \u0592\u2192 P(V \u2217 ), we obtain the natural embedding P(V \u2217 ) \u0592\u2192 P(H \u2217 ) induced by\nthe natural map of the Hilbert spaces H \u2192 V . The latter embedding must be\nsurjective hence P(V \u2217 ) = P(H \u2217 ).\nThis concludes the proof of the proposition.\n4. Metric \u039b\nIn this section, \u03c01 (X) is not assumed to be large. We assume \u03c01 (X) is residually\nfinite and a general curvilinear section C \u2282 X has g(C) \u2265 2. The metric \u039b\nwas suggested by a problem of Yau [Y, Sect. 6, p. 139] who proposed to study\nlimt\u2192\u221e 1t gX,Kt when K is the ample canonical bundle on X. The metric \u039b is a\ngeneralization of the classical Poincar\u00e9 metric though it is not necessary a Bergman\nmetric. We will define a real analytic potential at every point of UX .\n(4.1) First, we will consider the case: C = X \u0592\u2192 Pr were C is a connected\nnonsingular projective curve of genus g(C) \u2265 2. We will assume the embedding is\n6\n\n\fgiven by a very ample line bundle LC such that\nKlC \u2282 LC \u2282 Km\nC,\nwhere KC is the canonical bundle and l, m are suitable integers. We get Bergmantype metrics on C (see, e.g., [Y, Sect. 6, p. 138] and [Ti, p. 99]) and the Poincar\u00e9\nmetric on \u2206. Since \u2206 is homogeneous,\n(4.1.1)\n\nB\u2206,Kt (z, \u03b6) = c(t)Bt\u2206,K (z, \u03b6)\n\n(B\u2206,K (z, \u03b6) = \u03c0 \u22121 (1 \u2212 z \u03b6\u0304)\u22122 ),\n\nwhere t \u226b 0 is an integer, c(t) is a known constant depending on t only, and B\u2206,Kt\ndenotes the t-Bergman kernel (see, e.g., [FK, p. 9], [Kol, (7.7.1)]). It follows\n(4.1.2)\n\n1\nlim g\u2206,Kt =\nt\u2192\u221e t\n\n\u0013\n1 \u2202 2 log B\u2206,Kt (z, z)\ndzdz\u0304 = g\u2206,K .\nlim\nt\u2192\u221e t\n\u2202z\u2202 z\u0304\n\n\u0012\n\n(4.2) If C is a general curvilinear section of X then we consider the inverse image\nof C on UX . By the Campana-Deligne theorem [Kol, Theorem 2.14], we obtain a\nconnected open Riemann surface R = RC \u2282 UX in place of the disk \u2206. We would\nlike to construct a metric on UX such that its restriction on R is well understood.\nSet \u0393 := Gal(\u2206/R). Let\n\b\nF\u0304 := z \u2208 \u2206 |Jac\u03b3 (z)| \u2264 1, \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 ,\n\n\b\nF := {z \u2208 F\u0304 |Jac\u03b3 (z)| < 1, \u2200\u03b3 6= 1\n\nbe the fundamental domain of R and the interior of the fundamental domain. One\ncan also employ the Dirichlet-type fundamental domain centered at q := 0 \u2208 \u2206:\n\b\nDq (\u0393) := z \u2208 \u2206 D\u2206 (z, q) \u2264 D\u2206 (z, \u03b3(q)), \u2200\u03b3 \u2208 \u0393}.\nIndeed, D\u2206 (q1 , q2 ) = D\u2206 (\u03b3q1 , \u03b3q2 ) for \u2200\u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 because of the natural embedding of\n\u2206 into an infinite-dimensional projective space where \u0393 acts by collineations.\n(4.2.1) High powers of LC := LX |C are squeezed between powers of the canonical\nbundle on C. For t \u2265 1, let bR,t denote the t-Bergman metric on RC with H.,t as\nin the classical example (3.3.3).\nLet Db,R,t denote the functional element of diastasis of bR,t at an arbitrary\npoint of RC . We lift bR,t and Db,R,t to \u2206 and get Db,R,t \u2264 Db,\u2206,t (locally at an\narbitrary point of \u2206) by Proposition 1. Furthermore, it follows the convergence of\nthe corresponding holomorphic functions on RC \u00d7 R\u0304C . Hence limt\u2192\u221e 1t Db,R,t \u2264\nDb,\u2206,1 . Set bR := limt\u2192\u221e 1t bR,t .\nIt will be a real analytic Gal(R/C)-invariant Bergman metric on RC . Indeed,\nbR,1 and k1 bR,t are real analytic Kahler metrics. According to Tian [Ti, Sect. 4],\n1\nt bR,t converge to bR,1 hence bR = bR,1 . We get the metric bR whose diastasic\npotential Pb,R := Pb,R,a is a global function on RC , where a \u2208 RC is the image of\nthe origin 0 \u2208 \u2206.\nOne can replace bR,1 by bR,m , where m is a sufficiently large fixed number, and\nrepeat the previous argument with bR,m,t in place of bR,t . As before, we obtain\n1\nbR,m,t .\nt\u2192\u221e t\n7\n\nbR,m = lim\n\n\fWe will denote the functional element of the diastasis of bR,m,t by Db,R,m,t .\n(4.2.2) Now, let LR denote the inverse image of LC on RC . We consider the\nmetrics gR,t constructed, as in [Ti], with the volume form dvg |RC and the Hermitian\nmetrics corresponding to h (see (3.1)) on powers of LR . We, then, consider\n1\ngR,t .\nt\u2192\u221e t\n\n\u039bR := lim\n\nWe claim it will be a real analytic Gal(R/C)-invariant metric on RC . Let DR,t\ndenote the functional element of diastasis of gR,t at an arbitrary point of RC . Since\nLtR \u2286 Kmt for \u2200t, DR,t is bounded by (a multiple of) Db,R,m,t .\nIt follows the uniform convergence of the corresponding holomorphic functions\non RC \u00d7 R\u0304C . Furthermore, DR,t generates a global function on RC . It follows the\ndiastasic potential of the metric \u039bR on RC , PR := PR,a , is a global function on\nRC , where a \u2208 RC is the image of the origin 0 \u2208 \u2206.\nTherefore we have established\nProposition-Definition 2. Let \u039bR := limt\u2192\u221e 1t gR,t be a metric on RC . It is a\nreal analytic Gal(R/C)-invariant Kahler metric. Its diastasic potential is a function\nPR := PR,a on RC , where a \u2208 RC is the image of the origin 0 \u2208 \u2206.\n(4.2.3) Remark. Now, we assume dim X \u2265 2, KX is ample, \u03c01 (X) is residually\nfinite and large, and the genus of the general curvilinear section C \u2282 X is at\nleast 2. Then UX may not have the Bergman metric, as in an example suggested\nby Campana, namely, consider a sufficiently general ample divisor X in a simple\nAbelian variety of dimension at least 3.\n(4.3) Now, we return to the situation in (3.1) with U = UX . For each positive\n0\ninteger m0 , the Hermitian metric h on LX induces a Hermitian metric hm0 on Lm\nX\nm0\nas well as on all inverse images of LX on the coverings of X.\n\nm0\nm0\n0\n0\n(4.3.1) We choose an orthonormal basis (sm\n0 , . . . , srm0 ) of H (X, LX ) with respect to dvg and hm0 . We have an inner product and a natural embedding:\n\nm0 m0\nhs\u03b1\n, s\u03b2 i\n\n:=\n\nZ\n\nX\n\nm0\n0\nhm0 (sm\n\u03b1 , s\u03b2 )dvg ;\n\n0 \u2217\n\u03c6X,m0 : X \u0592\u2192 Prm0 := P(H 0 (X, Lm\nX ) ).\n\nLet gF S denote the corresponding standard Fubini-Study metric on the projective\nspace. As in Yau [Y, Sect. 6, p. 139] (see also Tian [Ti]), the m10 -multiple of gF S\non Prm0 restricts to a Kahler metric on X:\ngX,m0 :=\n\n1 \u2217\n\u03c6\ngF S .\nm0 X,m0\n\n\u2217\n(4.3.2) Similar statement holds for all finite coverings of X. The bundles \u03c4i0\nLX\n\u2217\n(0 \u2264 i < \u221e) are ample. However, \u03c4i0 LX 's are not necessary very ample bundles.\n\u2217\nFor an appropriate mi , the bundle (\u03c4i0\nLX )m0 mi is very ample hence it defines a\nnatural embedding \u03c6Xi ,m0 mi : Xi \u0592\u2192 Prm0 mi into an appropriate projective space.\nAs above, we get a metric gXi ,m0 mi := m01mi \u03c6\u2217X,m0 mi gF S on Xi and the corresponding diastasic potential.\nFor all i = 0, . . . , we consider the metrics gXi ,m0 mi as m0 \u2192 \u221e.\n8\n\n\f(4.3.3) We consider pullbacks on UX of the metrics gXi ,m0 mi and the corresponding diastasises. We will establish that the functional elements of the diastasises\nconverge at a point p \u2208 UX , and we will obtain a real analytic strictly plurisubharmonic functional element at p. These functional elements will define the desired\nKahler metric \u039b on UX .\nLet H\u221e denote the hyperplane at infinity in Pr . We can and will assume that\nthe functional elements of diastasises generate functions on the preimages of X\\H\u221e\non Xi 's.\nWe assume the point p does not lie at infinity. We consider a small compact\nneighborhood G \u2282 UX of p. The pullbacks on UX of the diastasises are functions\non G.\nFirst, we establish the pointwise convergence at p of the pullbacks of diastasises.\nWe take a sufficiently general curvilinear section C \u2282 X \u2282 Pr whose inverse image\non UX contains p. We, then, apply Proposition-Definition 2.\nNext, we apply the Montel theorem to get the uniform convergence on G \u00d7 \u1e20\nof the corresponding holomorphic functional elements (the complexifications as in\nSect. 2) to a holomorphic functional element. We obtain a real analytic functional\nelement at the fixed point p, denoted by DUX (p, u).\nIt is easy to see that DUX (p, z(u), z\u0304(u)) is strictly plurisubharmonic, where z, z\u0304\nare coordinates in a neighborhood with origin at p. Indeed, we take an arbitrary\ntangent vector v to UX at p. We can assume that the inverse image of a sufficiently\ngeneral curvilinear section of X is tangent to v. We get DUX (p, u) is strictly\nplurisubharmonic. We observe that DUX (p, u) will be the diastasic potential at p\nof the desired metric \u039b.\nThus, we have established the following\nProposition-Definition 3. We assume that a general curvilinear section C \u2282 X\nhas g(C) \u2265 2. Then UX is equipped with a real analytic \u03c01 (X)-invariant Kahler\nmetric, denoted by \u039b. The restriction of \u039b on RC , the inverse image on UX of a\ngeneral curvilinear section C \u2282 X, is the metric \u039bR on RC .\n5. Proof of the theorem\nWe assume UX and all Xi 's are equipped with the metric \u039b. Let I, R \u2282 UX be\ntwo subsets with I compact. Let d(u, p) denote the distance function on UX with\nits Riemannian structure induced by \u039b. We set \u03be(I, R) := supu\u2208I [inf p\u2208R d(u, p)].\nWe say that a sequence of subsets {R\u03b3 }\u03b3\u2208N , where R\u03b3 \u2282 UX , approximates the\nset I if lim\u03b3\u2192\u221e \u03be(I, R\u03b3 ) = 0.\n(5.1) Prolongation. Let z = (z1 , . . . , zn ) be a local coordinate system in a small\nneighborhood V with origin at a fixed point a \u2208 V \u2282 UX . Let \u03a6\u0303a (z(p), z(p)) be the\ndiastasic potential at a. Let b \u2208 UX be an arbitrary point. Let\nI : u = u(s)\n\n(0 \u2264 s \u2264 1, u(0) = a, u(1) = b)\n\nbe a path joining a and b.\n(5.1.1) Prolongation along the path I. We say \u03a6\u0303a (z(p), z(p)) has a prolongation\nalong I if the following two conditions are satisfied:\n(i) To every s \u2208 [0, 1] there corresponds a functional element of diastasic potential \u03a6\u0303u(s) (z(p), z(p)) at u(s) (u(s) is also called the center).\n9\n\n\f(ii) For every s0 \u2208 [0, 1], we can take a suitable subarc u := u(s) (|s \u2212 s0 | \u2264\n\u01eb, \u01eb > 0) of I contained in the domain of convergence of \u03a6\u0303u(s0 ) (z(p), z(p))\nsuch that every functional element \u03a6\u0303u(s) (z(p), z(p)) with |s \u2212 s0 | \u2264 \u01eb is a\ndirect prolongation of \u03a6\u0303u(s0 ) (z(p), z(p)).\nThe direct prolongation means the following. Suppose \u03a6\u0303\u03b11 (z(p), z(p)) is defined\non V1 and \u03a6\u0303\u03b12 (z(p), z(p)) is defined on V2 (V1 \u2229V2 6= \u2205). Then \u03a6\u0303\u03b12 (z(p), z(p)) is the\ndirect prolongation of \u03a6\u0303\u03b11 (z(p), z(p)) if they coincide on V1 \u2229 V2 . Recall that the\ncomplexification allows us to consider the corresponding holomorphic function in\nplace of the diastasic potential. It follows a prolongation along I is unique provided\nit exists.\nLet A = {a\u03bd } (a, b \u2208 A, I = \u0100) be a countable ordered dense subset of I. We\nwould like to prolongate \u03a6\u0303a (z(p), z(p)) along I obtaining the diastasic potential\n\u03a6\u0303a\u03bd (z(p), z(p)) of \u039b for each a\u03bd . We claim the prolongation along I is possible.\n(5.1.2) Now, we will make use of the assumption \u03c01 (X) is large. We can assume\nI is embedded in X via \u03c4 ; otherwise, we could have replaced X by Xi for i \u226b 0.\nThe set A is a union of an increasing sequence of finite ordered subsets:\nA1 \u2282 A2 \u2282 * * * \u2282 A\u03b3 \u2282 * * * \u2282 A,\n\na, b \u2208 A\u03b3 (\u2200\u03b3).\n\nWe consider an arbitrary A\u03b3 and the corresponding set\n\u03c4i (A\u03b3 ) \u2282 \u03c4i (I) \u2282 Xi \u2282 Pri ,\nwhere i is a sufficiently large integer and ri is an appropriate integer. We apply Bertini's theorems to the linear system of curvilinear sections passing through\n\u03c4i (A\u03b3 ), i.e., the moving part of the system is a one-dimensional subscheme in Xi .\nWe claim this linear system (and its inverse images) have no fixed components on\nXi for all i \u226b 0.\nSuppose, to the contrary, W \u2282 Xi is a fixed component. Then W belongs to the\nlinear span of \u03c4i (A\u03b3 ) \u2282 Pri . We move up along the tower (3.1.1). For j \u226b i \u226b 0,\n\u22121\n(W ). Hence the corresponding\nthe linear span of \u03c4j (A\u03b3 ) \u2282 Prj will not contain \u03c4ji\n\u22121\nlinear system on Xj does not contain \u03c4ji (W ). Therefore the linear system has no\nfixed components.\nA priory, a general member of the system may have singularities at the base\npoints of the system. However, we can always assume Pri is sufficiently large, and\nour system is sufficiently large as well. Thus, the general member of the linear\nsystem on Xj will be a connected nonsingular curve. Its inverse image on UX will\nbe a connected open Riemann surface R\u03b3 by the Campana-Deligne theorem [Kol,\nTheorem 2.14]. These Riemann surfaces will approximate I as \u03b3 goes to infinity.\n(5.1.3) For every \u03b3, the diastasic potential of the induced metric on R := R\u03b3 is\nthe restriction of the corresponding diastasic potential of UX , and PR := PR,a is a\nfunction on R.\nWe replace the path I and an arbitrary A\u03b3 (\u03b3 \u226b 0) by a broken geodesic \u03c3\u03b3\nbetween the points a and b. Namely, we replace the subpath of I between two\nadjacent points of A\u03b3 by a geodesic on UX . We also consider the corresponding\nbroken geodesic \u03c1\u03b3 on R\u03b3 . Recall (Sect. 2) that the diastasis approximates the\n10\n\n\fsquare of the geodesic distance in the small. Hence \u03c1\u03b3 will be close to \u03c3\u03b3 provided\neach a\u03bd is close to a\u03bd+1 , and we get\nlim \u03be(I, \u03c3\u03b3 ) = lim \u03be(I, \u03c1\u03b3 ) = 0\n\n\u03b3\u2192\u221e\n\n\u03b3\u2192\u221e\n\n(\u03c3\u03b3 \u2282 UX , \u03c1\u03b3 \u2282 R\u03b3 ).\n\n(5.1.4) Now, we will establish the prolongation along I. Assume we can prolongate along I\\b. We take a sufficiently small subarc E \u2282 I in the domain Vb\nb\nof \u03a6\u0303V\nb (z(p), z(p)) := \u03a6\u0303b (z(p), z(p)). Take a point w \u2208 E\\b and its small neighVb\nw\nborhood Vw \u2282 Vb in UX . We set \u03a6\u0303V\nb (z(p), z(p)) := \u03a6\u0303b (z(p), z(p))|Vw , more\nw\nprecisely, \u03a6\u0303V\nb (z(p), z(p)) is a real analytic function on Vw with center w (funcb\ntional element) obtained from the real analytic function \u03a6\u0303V\nb (z(p), z(p)) on Vb with\ncenter b. For p \u2208 Vw , we claim\nVw\nVw\nw\n\u03a6wb (p) := \u03a6\u0303V\nb (z(p), z(p)) \u2212 \u03a6\u0303w (z(p), z(p)) = DUX (b, p) \u2212 DUX (w, p) = 0,\nVw\nwhere DU\n(b, p) is the real analytic function in z(p), z(p) on Vw with center w\nX\nobtained from the real analytic function DUX (b, p) in z(p), z(p) on Vb with center\nb.\nLet u \u2208 Vw be an arbitrary point. We choose {R\u03b3 }, as above, with an additional\ncondition: u, w \u2208 R\u03b3 (\u2200\u03b3). Then \u03a6wb R\u03b3 (u) = 0 for all \u03b3 \u226b 0 because\nVw\nVw\nDR\n(b, u) \u2212 DR\n(w, u) = 0\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\n(\u2200\u03b3 \u226b 0)\n\nand the fundamental property of diastasis (Sect. 2).\nIt follows we can prolongate \u03a6\u0303a (z(p), z\u0304(p)) along I. Since UX is simply connected, we obtain the desired function PU := PU,a on UX .\n(5.2) In view of the Oka-Grauert-Narasimhan theorem (Grauert's version), it\nremains to verify that, for any real \u03b1, the following set is relatively compact in UX :\nE\u03b1 := {u \u2208 UX PU (u) < \u03b1}.\nSuppose S \u2282 E\u03b1 is an infinite discrete subset without limit points in UX . Then\nwe will derive a contradiction by showing that PU is unbounded on S. Since X is\ncompact, \u03c4 (S) will be either a finite set or it will have a limit point. It suffices to\nreplace S by an infinite set T\u03b1 in the fiber of \u03c4 over a point Q \u2208 X and show that\nPU is unbounded on T\u03b1 . If \u03c4 (S) has a limit point then Q is such a point.\nWe consider a general curvilinear section C \u2282 X through Q. Set RC := \u03c4 \u22121 (C).\nWe obtain a connected open Riemann surface by the Campana-Deligne theorem\n[Kol, Theorem 2.14].\nBy the fundamental property of diastasis (Sect. 2), PR = PU |RC where PR is\nthe corresponding diastasic potentials on RC . One can find an infinite discrete\nsubset T\u0303\u03b1 \u2282 F whose image on RC will be close to the corresponding points of T\u03b1 .\nMoreover, T\u0303\u03b1 is approaching the boundary of \u2206.\nWe pick a point q \u2208 F such that its image on X is close to Q. We will identify\nD\u039bR (q, *) with its inverse image on F . We see that D\u039bR (q, *) goes to infinity on\nT\u0303\u03b1 by considering the tower of coverings:\nC \u2190 * * * \u2190 Ci \u2190 * * * \u2190 RC ,\n11\n\n\fwhere Ci \u2282 Xi (see (3.1.1)), and the diatasises of the corresponding Bergman-type\nmetrics of members of the tower restricted to the complement of hyperplane at\ninfinity where they generate functions as in (4.3.3).\nBy Proposition 1, the diastasises increase as we move up in the tower. So, PR\nis unbounded on T\u0303\u03b1 and T\u03b1 , and PU will be unbounded on S.\nThe contradiction proves the theorem.\n(5.3) Remark. Similar argument proves the Shafarevich conjecture when X is\nsingular. Namely, let X \u0592\u2192 Pr be a connected normal projective variety of dimension n > 0. Assume \u03c01 (X) is large and residually finite. Then its universal covering\nis a Stein space. The details will appear elsewhere.\nAcknowledgment.
