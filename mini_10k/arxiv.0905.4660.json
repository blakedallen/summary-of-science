Boomsma and Dani\u00ebl Boer\n\narXiv:0905.4660v3 [hep-ph] 9 Jul 2009\n\nDepartment of Physics and Astronomy, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam\nDe Boelelaan 1081, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, the Netherlands\n(Dated: November 2, 2018)\nThe CP-restoring phase transition at \u03b8 = \u03c0 and high temperature is investigated using two related\nmodels that aim to describe the low-energy phenomenology of QCD, the NJL model and the linear\nsigma model coupled to quarks. Despite many similarities between the models, different predictions\nfor the order of the phase transition result. Using the Landau-Ginzburg formalism, the origin of this\ndifference is traced back to a non-analytic vacuum term at zero temperature that is present in the\nNJL model, but usually not included in the linear sigma model. Due to the absence of explicit CP\nviolation, this term always alters the qualitative aspects of the high temperature phase transition\nat \u03b8 = \u03c0, just as for \u03b8 = 0 in the chiral limit.\nPACS numbers: 12.39.-x,11.30.Er,11.30.Rd\n\nIt is well known that there is a possibility of CP violation in the strong interaction due to instanton contributions.\n\u03b8g2\nThese contributions are incorporated in the QCD Lagrangian through the topological 32\u03c0\n2 F F\u0303 -term, where \u03b8 is the\nQCD vacuum angle. This term violates CP, unless \u03b8 = 0 mod \u03c0. The case \u03b8 = \u03c0 is special, because then Dashen's\nphenomenon can occur, i.e., spontaneous CP violation at \u03b8 = \u03c0 [1].\nFrom experiments it is known that in nature \u03b8 is very small [2, 3, 4, 5]. The reason for this is unknown and is\ncommonly referred to as the strong CP problem. However, it has been argued that in heavy-ion collisions meta-stable\nCP-violating states could be created corresponding to states with an effective \u03b8 [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Studying\nthe behavior of the strong interactions at nonzero \u03b8 is therefore of interest and has been done quite extensively using\nchiral Lagrangians, see for example Refs [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20].\nRecently the \u03b8-dependence of two models describing the chiral dynamics of low energy QCD have been studied, the\nNJL model [21] and the linear sigma model coupled to quarks (LSMq) [22]. In both models the effects of instantons\nare included through an additional interaction, the 't Hooft determinant interaction [23, 24]. It was found that both\nmodels exhibit Dashen's phenomenon, which turns out to be temperature dependent. This is to be expected, since at\nhigh temperature the effects of instantons, which are needed for the CP violation, are exponentially suppressed [25].\nIn both models the spontaneous CP violation at \u03b8 = \u03c0 disappears at a critical temperature between 100 and 200\nMeV, however, the order of the phase transition differs. In case of the NJL model the transition is of second order,\nwhereas in the LSMq model it is of first order. Clearly this difference is important, because a first order transition\nallows meta-stable phases, in contrast to a second order transition.\nAlthough the NJL and LSMq model are not the same, they are closely related. Eguchi [26] has shown that when the\nNJL model is bosonized, a linear sigma model is obtained (see also [27]). However, the effects of quarks are treated\ndifferently in both models, which was already discussed in Ref. [28] for \u03b8 = 0. In the case of the LSMq model the effects\nof the quarks are usually only taken into account for nonzero temperatures, whereas in the NJL model their effects\nare necessarily incorporated also at zero temperature. Ref. [28] found that the order of the chiral symmetry restoring\nphase transition at \u03b8 = 0 was the same in both models, but the critical temperatures differ. While the qualitative\naspects of the phase transition are similar at \u03b8 = 0, this is not the case for the high temperature CP-restoring phase\ntransition at \u03b8 = \u03c0 as we will discuss in detail. We should mention here that the situation at \u03b8 = 0 depends on the\namount of explicit chiral symmetry breaking. In Ref. [29] it was observed that when the pion mass is reduced in order\nto study the chiral limit, neglecting the effects of the quarks at zero temperature can affect the order of the high\ntemperature phase transition at \u03b8 = 0 too.\nAlthough there is a CP-restoring phase transition at high chemical potential also, in this paper we will restrict to\nthe temperature dependence of this phase transition at \u03b8 = \u03c0, because there the differences between the two models\nare most pronounced. The paper is organized as follows. First, the effective potentials of both models are analyzed\nanalytically, which will allow the determination of the order of the phase transitions using standard Landau-Ginzburg\ntype of arguments. A comparison to numerical results obtained earlier corroborates these conclusions. Subsequently,\nwe will discuss the bosonification procedure of Eguchi, which relates the NJL model to a linear sigma model and\nallows us to further pinpoint the origin of the similarities and differences with the LSMq model.\n\n\f2\nI.\n\nNJL MODEL\n\nThe Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model, introduced in Refs. [30, 31], is a model for low energy QCD that contains\nfour-point interactions between the quarks. In this paper the following form of the NJL model is used, in the notation\nof Ref. [21]\nLNJL = \u03c8\u0304 (i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u2212 m) \u03c8 + Lq\u0304q + Ldet ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere m is the current quark mass. In contrast to Ref. [21], here the up and down quark masses are taken equal,\nwhich matters little for our present purposes. Furthermore,\n\u0003\n\u0002\n(2)\nLq\u0304q = G1 (\u03c8\u0304\u03c4a \u03c8)2 + (\u03c8\u0304\u03c4a i\u03b35 \u03c8)2 ,\n\nis the attractive part of the q\u0304q channel of the Fierz transformed color current-current interaction [32] and\n\u0001\nLdet = 8G2 ei\u03b8 det \u03c8\u0304R \u03c8L + h.c.,\n\n(3)\n\nis the 't Hooft determinant interaction which depends on the QCD vacuum angle \u03b8 and describes the effects of\ninstantons [23, 24]. In the literature G1 and G2 are often taken equal, which at \u03b8 = 0 means that the low energy\nspectrum consists of \u03c3 and \u03c0 fields only, but here we will allow them to be different. We will restrict to the two\nflavor case, using \u03c4a with a = 0, ..., 3 as generators of U(2). We will not consider nonzero baryon or isospin chemical\npotential.\nThe symmetry structure of the NJL model is very similar to that of QCD. In the absence of quark masses\nand the instanton interaction, there is a global SU(3)c \u00d7U(2)L \u00d7U(2)R -symmetry. The instanton interaction\nbreaks it to SU(3)c \u00d7SU(2)L \u00d7SU(2)R \u00d7U(1)B . For nonzero, but equal quark masses this symmetry is reduced to\nSU(3)c \u00d7SU(2)V \u00d7U(1)B .\nWe choose the parameters the same way as in Refs. [21, 33]. This means we write\nG1 = (1 \u2212 c)G0 ,\n\nG2 = cG0 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the parameter c controls the instanton interaction, while the value for the quark condensate at \u03b8 = 0 (which\nis determined by the combination G1 + G2 ) is kept fixed. For our numerical studies we will use the following values\nfor the parameters: m = 6 MeV, a three-dimensional momentum UV cut-off \u039b = 590 MeV/c and G0 \u039b2 = 2.435.\nThese values lead to a pion mass of 140.2 MeV, a pion decay constant of 92.6 MeV and finally, a quark condensate\n \u0304 = (\u2212241.5 MeV)3 [33], all in reasonable agreement with experimental determinations.\nh\u016bui = hddi\nA.\n\nThe effective potential\n\nTo calculate the ground state of the theory, the effective potential has to be minimized. In this section the effective\npotential is calculated in the mean-field approximation. In the following we will only consider the case of unbroken\nisospin symmetry, such that only nonzero h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i and/or h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c8i can arise. At \u03b8 = 0 only h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i becomes nonzero. A\nnonzero h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c8i signals that CP invariance is broken, i.e., it serves as an order parameter for the CP-violating phase.\nTo obtain the effective potential in the mean-field approximation, first the interaction terms are \"linearized\" in\nthe presence of the h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i and h\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c8i condensates (this is equivalent to the procedure with a Hubbard-Stratonovich\ntransformation used in Ref.

As was shown in Ref. [21] the\nphenomenon of spontaneous CP violation is governed by the strength c of the 't Hooft determinant interaction. It will\nbe assumed that c is 0.2, which following the arguments of Ref. [33] is considered realistic. But in fact, the critical\ntemperature is too very good approximation c-independent for c above \u223c 0.05, as can be seen from the (T, c) phase\ndiagram given in Ref. [21].\nWe will start with a numerical minimization as a function of the temperature, the results of which, together with\nthose for the LSMq model, are shown in Fig. 1. One observes that the critical temperature of the NJL model is\nsignificantly larger than the one of the linear sigma model, in agreement with the results of Ref. [28] for the chiral\nphase transition at \u03b8 = 0. Furthermore, the order of the phase transition is clearly different, contrary to the results\nof Ref. [28] for \u03b8 = 0.\nNext we will derive an analytic expression for the effective potential for the NJL model. Two important observations\nwhich can be made from the numerical study will be help. First, we note that \u03b10 is very small and constant as long\nas \u03b20 is nonzero, which allows us to approximate M 2 \u2248 \u03b202 . Furthermore, \u03b20 and hence M can be considered much\nsmaller than \u03c0T and \u039b, allowing expansions. These observations simplify our study considerably.\nThe phase transition occurs for M much smaller than \u039b, so Eq. (12) can be expanded in M/\u039b at T = 0:\n\"\n#\n\u0001\n4\n2\n4\n2\n4\n2\n2\n4\nM\nlog\n4\u039b\nM\nlog\nM\nM\n\u039b\nM\n\u039b\nVqT =0 = \u03bdq \u2212\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+ *** .\n(13)\n64\u03c0 2\n64\u03c0 2\n128\u03c0 2\n16\u03c0 2\n16\u03c0 2\nFor the phase transition, the non-analytic term M 4 log M 2 turns out to be very relevant. We will see that it is exactly\nthe absence of this term at finite temperatures in the NJL model that causes the differences between the two models.\nUsually the temperature-dependent part of the potential has to be evaluated numerically, however when M < \u03c0T\nthe integral can be expanded in M/T . As can be inferred from Fig. 1 it is exactly this regime which is relevant for the\n\n\f4\n400\n\nNJL \u03b10\n\u03b20\nLS \u03c30\n\u03b70\n\n350\n300\n\nMeV\n\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\nT (MeV)\n\n150\n\n200\n\nFIG. 1: The temperature dependence of the condensates in the NJL and linear sigma model.\n\nphase transition. Note that the temperature-dependent part of the potential is UV finite, which means that for this\npart the cut-off can be taken to infinity. In Ref. [21] this was not done, leading to a slightly larger critical temperature.\nPerforming the expansion, we obtain [35]\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\nZ\n\u0011\n\u0010\n7\u03c0 2 T 4 M 2 T 2\n3 1\nM4\nM2\nd3 p\n\u2212Ep /T\n\u2212\n=\n\u03bd\n\u03b3\n\u2212\nT\nlog\n1\n+\ne\n\u2212\nlog\n\u03c0\n+\n*\n*\n*\n.

We note that this expression is the\nsame as the chiral limit at \u03b8 = 0, with \u03b20 replaced by \u03b10 .\nThe phase transition occurs when BNJL (T ) changes sign. As the potential is symmetric and quartic in the order\nparameter, we conclude (following Landau-Ginzburg arguments) that the phase transition is of second order, which\nthe numerical analysis corroborates.

It is a hybrid model that includes both meson and constituent\nquark degrees of freedom, the latter only at nonzero temperature however. As was the case in the NJL model, the\neffects of instantons are included via the 't Hooft determinant interaction. In this paper the analysis of Ref. [22] is\nfollowed.\nWe will start with the T = 0 case, when only mesons are considered. The Lagrangian, which contains all Lorentz\ninvariant terms allowed by symmetry and renormalizability has the following form, using a slightly different notation\nthan Ref. [22]\nLLS =\n\n1\n\u03bc2\n\u03bb1\n\u03bb2\n\u03ba\nTr(\u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2020 \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6) +\nTr(\u03c6\u2020 \u03c6) \u2212 [Tr(\u03c6\u2020 \u03c6)]2 \u2212 Tr[(\u03c6\u2020 \u03c6)2 ] + [ei\u03b8 det(\u03c6) + e\u2212i\u03b8 det(\u03c6\u2020 )]\n2\n2\n4\n4\n2\nH\n1\n+ Tr[ \u221a (\u03c6 + \u03c6\u2020 )] ,\n2\n2\n\n(20)\n\nwhere \u03c6 is chiral field, defined as\n1\n1\n\u03c6 = \u221a (\u03c3 + i\u03b7) + \u221a (a0 + i\u03c0) * \u03c4 .\n2\n2\n\n(21)\n\nThe Lagrangian incorporates both spontaneous and explicit breaking of chiral symmetry, the latter through the term\nproportional to H. To study this symmetry breaking, we can concentrate on the potential corresponding to Eq. (20),\nexpressed in the meson fields\n\u03bc2 2\n(\u03c3 + \u03c0 2 + \u03b7 2 + a20 )\n2\n\u03ba\n\u2212 cos \u03b8 (\u03c3 2 + \u03c0 2 \u2212 \u03b7 2 \u2212 a20 )\n2\n+\u03ba sin \u03b8 (\u03c3\u03b7 \u2212 \u03c0 * a0 ) \u2212 H\u03c3\n\u03bb2\n1\n+ (\u03bb1 + )(\u03c3 2 + \u03b7 2 + \u03c0 2 + a20 )2\n4\n2\n2\u03bb2\n(\u03c3a0 + \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u00d7 a0 )2 .\n+\n4\n\nT =0\nVLS\n= \u2212\n\n(22)\n\nThe spontaneous symmetry breaking manifests itself through nonzero \u03c3 and \u03b7 condensates and are obtained by\nminimizing the potential. We allow for these condensates by shifting the fields\n\u03c3 \u2192 \u03c30 + s,\n\n\u03b7 \u2192 \u03b70 + h,\n\n(23)\n\nwhere \u03c30 and \u03b70 are the values that minimize the potential and s and h are the fluctuations. These \u03c30 and \u03b70 are\nproportional to the condensates \u03b10 and \u03b20 of the NJL model, respectively.\nThe potential can now be split in two parts, a vacuum part and one that depends on the fluctuations, i.e.,\nvac,T =0\nT =0\nfluc\nVLS\n= VLS\n+ VLS\n.\n\n(24)\n\nFirst we concentrate on the vacuum part, which is given by the following expression:\nvac,T =0\nVLS\n=\n\n\u03bb 2\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n(\u03c3 \u2212 v\u03b82 )2 \u2212 H\u03c30 + (\u03b702 \u2212 u2\u03b8 )2 + \u03ba sin \u03b8 \u03c30 \u03b70 + \u03c302 \u03b702 \u2212 (v\u03b84 + u4\u03b8 ),\n4 0\n4\n2\n4\n\n(25)\n\nwhere we have defined the combination of couplings \u03bb \u2261 \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 /2, and follow the notation of Ref. [22]:\nv\u03b82 \u2261\n\n\u03bc2 + \u03ba cos \u03b8\n\u03bb\n\n;\n\nu2\u03b8 \u2261 v\u03b82 \u2212\n\n2\u03ba\ncos \u03b8 .\n\u03bb\n\n(26)\n\nThis part of the potential determines the phase structure and has to be compared with the NJL expression (13). The\nmain difference is that this potential is fully analytic and does not contain any logarithmic terms.\n\n\f6\nThe part of the potential that depends on the fluctuations is used to determine the parameters \u03bc2 , \u03ba, H, \u03bb1 and\nfluc\n\u03bb2 in Eq. (20). They are obtained by fitting the masses contained in VLS\nand the pion decay constant at \u03b8 = 0 such\nfluc\nthat the model reproduces the low-energy phenomenology of QCD.

Furthermore, cross terms like \u03c3\u03b7 become nonzero,\nsignalling that the mass eigenstates are no longer CP eigenstates, as discussed for the NJL model in Ref. [21]. As\na consequence, the \u03c3-field mixes with the \u03b7-field and the \u03c0-field mixes with the a0 -field. We will not give these\nexpressions explicitly here.\nA.\n\nNonzero temperature\n\nIn the LSMq model the quarks start to contribute at nonzero temperatures. In fact, it is assumed that all the\ntemperature dependence comes from the quarks. In Ref. [28] it is argued that this approach is more justified for\nstudying high T phenomena than considering only thermal fluctuations of the meson fields, because at high T constituent quarks become light and mesonic excitations heavy. For the study of the chiral phase transition at \u03b8 = 0 this\napproach yields results that are qualitatively similar to those of the NJL model.\nThe part of the LSMq Lagrangian that depends on the quark fields is:\nLq = \u03c8\u0304 [i\u2202/ \u2212 g (\u03c3 + i\u03b35 \u03b7 + a0 * \u03c4 + i\u03b35 \u03c0 * \u03c4 )] \u03c8.\n\n(29)\n\nThe quark thermal fluctuations are incorporated in the effective potential for the mesonic sector, by means of integrating out the quarks to one loop [22]. The resulting quark contribution to the potential is given by\nZ\n\u0011\n\u0010\nd3 p\n\u2212Ep /T\nVqT = \u2212\u03bdq\n.\n(30)\nT\nlog\n1\n+\ne\n(2\u03c0)3\np\nThis expression is equal to the temperature dependent part of the NJL model Eq. (14), with again Ep = p2 + M 2\nand the constituent\nquark mass M depends on the vacuum expectation values of the meson fields in the following\np\nway: M = g (\u03c302 + \u03b702 ), where g is the Yukawa coupling between the quarks and the mesons. A reasonable value for\nthe constituent quark mass at \u03b8 = 0 fixes this coupling constant. In Ref. [22] (and here) g = 3.3 is used, which leads\nto a cross-over for the chiral phase transition as a function of temperature at \u03b8 = 0 and to a constituent quark mass\nof approximately 1/3 of the nucleon mass.\nB.\n\nThe phase transition\n\nWith all parameters fixed, we can study the CP-restoring phase transition at \u03b8 = \u03c0 in the LSMq model. This was\nstudied in detail, along with other values for \u03b8, in Ref. [22]. There also the effect of a magnetic field was discussed,\nwhich we will not take into account.\n\n\f7\nWe are now going to follow the same procedure as for the NJL model to study the details of the phase transition.\nAgain, we start the discussion with numerical results of the minimization of the effective potential, this time the results\nof Ref. [22]. They are shown in Fig. 1. From this figure, two simplifying assumptions can be inferred. First, as was\nthe case for the NJL model, in the neighborhood of the phase transition M < \u03c0T , allowing Eq. (30) to be expanded\nin M/T as in Eq. (14). Second, \u03c30 is much smaller than \u03b70 which means that we can neglect the \u03c30 -dependence. This\nassumption leads to a small error near \u03b70 \u2248 0, but as we checked explicitly this is not important since the structure\nof the extrema of the potential is not altered.\nSumming the contributions at zero and nonzero temperature gives the following form for the effective potential\nvac\nVLS\n(T ) = ALS (T ) + BLS (T )\u03b702 + CLS (T )\u03b704 + DLS \u03b704 log \u03b702 ,\n\n(31)\n\nwhere\nALS (T ) = \u2212\n\n7 2 4\n\u03c0 T \u03bdq ,\n720\n\n\u0001\n1\ng 2 T 2 \u03bdq \u2212 24(\u03bc2 + \u03ba) ,\n48\n!\n\u0001\n\u0001\ng\n1 \u03bdq log \u03c0T + \u03b3E \u2212 43 g 4\n+ 8\u03bb ,\nCLS (T ) =\n32\n\u03c02\n\nBLS (T ) =\n\nDLS =\n\ng 4 \u03bdq\n.\n64\u03c0 2\n\n(32)\n(33)\n(34)\n(35)\n\nThe form of this potential is clearly different from the one of the NJL model Eq. (15), the difference being the\nuncanceled logarithmic term. This term proportional to DLS will always cause the phase transition to be of first\norder. As observed for the NJL model, also in this case the potential is exactly the same as the chiral limit at \u03b8 = 0,\nwith \u03b70 replaced by \u03c30 . Beyond the chiral limit the explicit symmetry breaking term \u223c H\u03c30 (which has no analogue\nat \u03b8 = \u03c0) will change the first order transition into a cross-over, unless the Yukawa coupling g is increased sufficiently\n[29, 37]. We conclude that the absence of explicit CP violation through a linear term in \u03b70 at \u03b8 = \u03c0 lies at the heart\nof the difference between the observations made here and those in Ref. [28].\nLike in the NJL model, it is the sign flip of BLS that modifies the structure of the minima. But instead of a phase\nLS (T )\ntransition, now a meta-stable state develops at \u03b70 = 0. When BLS (T ) becomes larger than 2DLS exp(\u2212 23 \u2212 CD\n)\nLS\nthe original minimum disappears. Between the two spinodals the minimum jumps, signalling a first order transition.\nWhen the parameters of Ref. [22] are used, we obtain the following values for the spinodals: 118 MeV and 129\nMeV. To find the exact point of the phase transition, the potential has to be minimized numerically, giving a critical\ntemperature of 126.4 MeV. As already noted, this is significantly lower than TcNJL , but the specific values depend on\nthe parameter choices made. As should be clear from the previous discussion, choosing different parameters would not\naffect the conclusion about the different orders of the phase transition, at least as long as M < \u03c0T, \u039b and \u03ba > \u2212\u03bc2\n(equivalently, m2\u03c3 > 3m2\u03c0 at T = 0).\nIII.\n\nRELATION BETWEEN THE NJL AND LSMq MODEL\n\nAs mentioned, the LSMq model is a hybrid model for mesons, which are coupled to quarks at nonzero temperature,\nand the NJL model is a quark model, where the bosonic states of quark-antiquark fields are interpreted as mesons.\nEguchi [26] has shown how to derive from the Lagrangian of the NJL model a Lagrangian for the mesonic excitations\nfor G2 = 0. This bosonification procedure is reviewed in Ref. [27]. Here the corresponding meson Lagrangian will be\nderived for G2 6= 0, which was also studied in Ref. [39] in the chiral limit.\nThe situation will be reviewed for \u03b8 = 0, when only the \u03c8\u0304\u03c8 receives a vacuum expectation. We start with the\nLagrangian given in Eq. (1).

[21] (where the dependence on the external momentum\nof the generalized I0 defined in, for example, Ref. [27] has been neglected). The Lagrangian (47) without the a0 and\n\u03b7-fields was also given in Ref. [40]. In the chiral limit the results agree with those of Ref. [39].\nEq. (47) is equal to the fluctuation part of the linear sigma model Lagrangian (20) using the following parameters\n\u03bb1 = 0,\n\u03bb2 = 4/I0 ,\n\u03bc2 = 2M 2 \u2212\n\nc\n,\n2(1 \u2212 2c)G0 I0\n\nc\n,\n2(1 \u2212 2c)G0 I0\nm\n.\nH =\n1/2\n2G0 I0\n\u03ba =\n\n(50)\n\nAlthough the bosonification of the NJL model yields \u03bb1 = 0, this is of no consequence for the order of the phase\ntransition, as the effective potential at zero temperature is a quartic polynomial irrespective of whether \u03bb1 = 0. It\ndoes however, affect the masses of the mesons. If \u03bb1 = 0, the following relation holds: m2\u03c3 \u2212 m2\u03c0 = m2a0 \u2212 m2\u03b7 = 4M 2 ,\na property of the NJL model already noted in Ref. [39]. Clearly, the bosonized NJL model does not yield the most\ngeneral linear sigma model. However, it gives additional contributions to the vacuum that usually are not taken into\naccount in the linear sigma model coupled to quarks [22, 28]. In Ref. [29] it is noted that upon inclusion of fluctuations\nusing an RG flow equation, the transition becomes second order. This boils down to including quark loop effects at\nzero temperature too and is consistent with our findings.\nTo conclude, the mesonic part of this bosonized NJL Lagrangian is equal to the mesonic part of the LSMq model.\nSo the mesons are treated in same way in the two models, but the vacuum contributions are treated differently. Since\nneither model is directly derived from QCD, it is not straightforward to draw a conclusion about the order of the\nphase transition expected in QCD. If the NJL model is viewed as a model for the microscopic theory underlying the\nlow energy mesonic theory, it would not seem justified to neglect the logarithmic term at zero temperature.\nIt is straightforward to bosonize the NJL model for \u03b8 6= 0 when also h\u03c8i\u03b35 \u03c8i can become nonzero, leading to cross\nterms that mix the \u03c3-field with the \u03b7-field and a0 -field with the \u03c0-field, but we do not give the expressions here as\nthey do not lead to any additional insights.\n\n\f10\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper the high-T CP-restoring phase transition at \u03b8 = \u03c0 was discussed for two different models which aim to\ndescribe the low-energy QCD phenomenology, the NJL model and the linear sigma model coupled to quarks. Although\nthe models are related, the philosophy of how the mesons are treated is quite different in both models. In the NJL\nmodel they are bosonic states of quark-antiquarks, whereas in the LSMq model they are the fundamental degrees\nof freedom, interacting with quarks at nonzero temperature. Using the bosonification procedure of Eguchi, one can\nshow that a bosonized NJL model gives a linear sigma model, in which mesons are treated in the same way as in the\nLSMq model. However, the vacuum contributions arising from the quark degrees of freedom are different. The LSMq\nmodel was motivated for high temperatures, when constituent quarks are light and mesons are heavy. Therefore, it\nis assumed that quarks only play a role at nonzero temperature and do not affect the vacuum contributions at zero\ntemperature. On the other hand, in the NJL model contributions by the quarks are necessarily taken into account\nalso at zero temperature. The temperature dependent contributions to the effective potential are equal in both\nmodels, coming exclusively from the quarks. In the end, the effective potentials of the models only differ in their zero\ntemperature contributions. Nevertheless, this directly affects the nature of the phase transition at high temperature\nat \u03b8 = \u03c0.\nThe temperature dependence of the ground state of both models was investigated using a Landau-Ginzburg analysis.\nThe difference between the models is that the potential as a function of the order parameter of the LSMq model\ncontains a non-analytic logarithmic term, whereas the potential of the NJL model is a quartic polynomial near the\nphase transition. It is this logarithm that makes the difference, it affects the order of the phase transition. This\nlogarithm comes from the contribution of the quarks at zero temperatures, but neglecting these contributions will\naffect the high temperature results qualitatively at \u03b8 = \u03c0. A similar effect occurs for the chiral symmetry restoration\nphase transition at \u03b8 = 0 close to the chiral limit, i.e. for sufficiently small explicit symmetry breaking. The absence\nof explicit CP violation is therefore an important aspect of the physics at \u03b8 = \u03c0.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Eduardo Fraga and Ana Mizher for fruitful discussions.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\n\nR.
