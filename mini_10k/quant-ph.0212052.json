In principle,\nit allows them to convey quantum information reliably\nthrough a classical channel (quantum teleportation [1]),\nto double the amount of classical information transmittable through a classical channel (quantum dense coding\n[2]), or to prepare at a distance states from nonorthogonal bases for secure communication (quantum key distribution [3, 4, 5]). These entanglement-assisted communication schemes are extendible to an arbitrary number of\nparties sharing multipartite entanglement. For instance,\na sender may transfer quantum information through classical channels to several receivers as reliably as allowed\nby optimal cloning (telecloning [6]), or the parties may\nshare quantum (or classical) information retrievable only\nwhen all parties cooperate (quantum secret sharing [7]).\nA more recent proposal that exploits the multi-party\nquantum correlations of multipartite entangled states is\nthe so-called Byzantine agreement protocol [8]. In general, the presence of entanglement is verified through the\nsuccess of a quantum protocol that would fail otherwise\n(e.g., quantum teleportation). Such an operational criterion is only sufficient for entanglement and failure does\nnot necessarily rule out its presence. In an experimental realization, however, before running through an entire entanglement-based protocol, it is desirable first to\nconfirm that the generation of sophisticated multi-party\nentangled states has succeeded. The aim of this paper is\nto provide a simple but unambiguous experimental test\nto check for a particular kind of genuinely multipartite\nentangled states, namely those described by continuous\nvariables (cv) and produced with squeezed light and linear optics.\nWork in the direction of generating tripartite cv entanglement has been carried out already by sending one\nhalf of a two-mode two-party entangled state through\nan extra beam splitter with a coherent state or a vacuum\nstate at its second input port [9, 10]. The resulting threemode state was a side product of the Bell measurement\nfor the teleportation of coherent states using a preshared\nsymmetric two-mode squeezed state [9]. Its tripartite en-\n\ntanglement was not further investigated in that experiment. In another experiment, reported recently [10], the\ntwo-mode state was asymmetric, corresponding to two\nindependently squeezed states combined at an asymmetric 1 : 2 beam splitter. The output three-mode state after\nan additional symmetric beam splitter was then similar\nto the states proposed in Ref. [11].\nQuantum communication, or more general quantum\ninformation with cv has attracted a lot of interest due\nto the relative simplicity and high efficiency in the generation, manipulation, and detection of optical cv states.\nAlthough recent results suggest that these assets of Gaussian cv operations (phase shifting, beam splitting, homodyne detections, phase-space displacements, squeezing)\nare not extendible to more advanced quantum protocols\nsuch as entanglement distillation [12, 13, 14], the simple\nand efficient cv approach still seems promising for many\ntasks and might be suitable for others too when combined\nwith discrete-variable (dv) strategies. On the other hand,\npotential linear-optics implementations of quantum protocols solely based on dv utilizing single photons are restricted by No-Go results such as the impossibility of a\ncomplete distinction between the four Bell states [15]. In\norder to perform such a Bell measurement near perfectly\nwith linear optics, one has to employ complicated entangled states of many auxiliary photons [16]. In contrast,\na Bell and also a GHZ state analyzer can be easily constructed in the cv setting using only beam splitters and\nhomodyne detectors [17, 18, 19].\nHow may one now verify experimentally the presence\nof entanglement without implementing a full quantum\nprotocol? We are here particularly concerned about the\nexperimental verification of genuinely multipartite entangled states where none of the parties is separable\nfrom the rest (in terms of the separability properties of\nthe total density matrix). In general, theoretical tests\nmight be as well applicable to the experimental verification. For instance, the violation of inequalities imposed\nby local realism confirms the presence of entanglement.\nProving genuine multipartite entanglement, however, requires stronger violations [20] than those determined by\nthe commonly used Mermin-Klyshko N -party inequalities [21, 22]. Moreover, in any case, violations of Belltype inequalities using Gaussian cv entangled states with\n\n\f2\nalways positive Wigner functions must rely on observables other than the quadratures (i.e., position and momentum). Photon number parity may serve as an appropriate dichotomic variable to reveal the nonlocality\nof the cv entangled states [23]. This applies to the twoparty two-mode EPR-like [23] and to the N -party N mode GHZ-like cv states [24]. Such an approach, however, is not very feasible due to its need for detectors\nresolving large photon number.\nThe negative partial transpose (npt) criterion [25] is\nsufficient and necessary for the bipartite inseparability\nof 2 \u00d7 2-dimensional, 2 \u00d7 3-dimensional [26], and 1 \u00d7 N\nmode Gaussian states [27, 28]. A complete experimental\ndetermination of the state in question would also enable\nan npt check. In general, any theoretical test is applicable when the experimentalist has full information about\nthe quantum state after measurements on an ensemble\nof identically prepared states (e.g. by quantum tomography [29]). Such a direct verification of entanglement via a\ncomplete state measurement is in general very demanding to the experimentalist, in particular when the state\nto be determined is a potentially multi-party entangled\nmulti-mode state.\nII.\n\nGAUSSIAN STATES\n\nThe multi-party entanglement criteria that we will derive here do not rely on the assumption of Gaussian\nstates. However, the states commonly produced in the\nlaboratory are indeed Gaussian and the theoretical classification of different types of multipartite entanglement\nbecomes simpler for Gaussian states [30].\nSince the entanglement properties of a multi-mode\nmulti-party state are invariant under local phase-space\ndisplacements, the multi-mode states may have zero\nmean and their Wigner function is of the form\n\u001a\ni\u22121 \u001b\n1\n1 h\n\u221a\nW (\u03be) =\n\u03beT ,\nexp \u2212 \u03be V (N )\n2\n(2\u03c0)N det V (N )\n(1)\n\nwith the 2N -dimensional vector \u03be having the quadrature\npairs of all N modes as its components,\n\u03be = (x1 , p1 , x2 , p2 , ..., xN , pN ) ,\n\u03be\u02c6 = (x\u03021 , p\u03021 , x\u03022 , p\u03022 , ..., x\u0302N , p\u0302N ) ,\n\n(2)\n\n(N )\n\nand with the 2N \u00d7 2N correlation matrix V\nhaving as\nits elements the second moments symmetrized according\nto the Weyl correspondence [31],\nTr[\u03c1\u0302 (\u2206\u03be\u02c6i \u2206\u03be\u02c6j + \u2206\u03be\u02c6j \u2206\u03be\u02c6i )/2] = h(\u03be\u02c6i \u03be\u02c6j + \u03be\u02c6j \u03be\u02c6i )/2i\nZ\n=\nW (\u03be) \u03bei \u03bej d2N \u03be\n=\n\n(N )\nVij\n\n,\n\nreal, symmetric, positive, and must obey the commutation relation [27, 28],\ni\n[\u03be\u02c6k , \u03be\u02c6l ] = \u039bkl ,\n2\n\nwhere \u2206\u03be\u02c6i = \u03be\u02c6i \u2212 h\u03be\u02c6i i = \u03be\u0302i for zero mean values. Note\nthat the correlation matrix of any physical state must be\n\n(4)\n\nwith the 2N \u00d7 2N matrix \u039b having the 2 \u00d7 2 matrix J\nas diagonal entry for each quadrature pair, for example\nfor N = 2,\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n0 1\nJ 0\n.\n(5)\n,\nJ=\n\u039b=\n\u22121 0\n0 J\nA direct consequence of this commutation relation and\nthe non-negativity of the density operator \u03c1\u0302 is the N mode uncertainty relation [27, 28],\nV (N ) \u2212\n\ni\n\u039b\u22650.\n4\n\n(6)\n\nNote that this condition is equivalent to V (N ) + i\u039b/4 \u2265 0\nby complex conjugation. As for the direct verification\nof entanglement via a complete state measurement, for\nGaussian cv states, the complete measurement of an N party N -mode quantum state is accomplished by determining the 2N \u00d7 2N second-moment correlation matrix.\nThis corresponds to N (1 + 2N ) independent entries taking into account the symmetry of the correlation matrix.\nKim et al. [32] recently demonstrated how to determine\nall these entries in the two-party two-mode case using\nbeam splitters and homodyne detectors. Joint homodyne detections of the two modes yield the intermode\ncorrelations such as hx\u03021 x\u03022 i \u2212 hx\u03021 ihx\u03022 i, hx\u03021 p\u03022 i \u2212 hx\u03021 ihp\u03022 i,\netc. Determining the local intramode correlations such\nas hx\u03021 p\u03021 + p\u03021 x\u03021 i/2 \u2212 hx\u03021 ihp\u03021 i is more subtle and requires\nadditional beam splitters and homodyne detections (or,\nalternatively, heterodyne detections). Once the 4 \u00d7 4\ntwo-mode correlation matrix is known, the npt criterion\ncan be applied as a sufficient and necessary condition for\nbipartite Gaussian two-mode inseparability (where npt\ncorresponds to a sign change of all the momentum variables with positions unchanged [27]). In fact, the entanglement can also be quantified for a given correlation\nmatrix [32, 33]. For three-party three-mode Gaussian\nstates, one may pursue a similar strategy. After measuring the 21 independent entries of the correlation matrix\n(for example, by extending Kim et al.'s scheme [32] to\nthe three-mode case), the sufficient and necessary criteria by Giedke et al. [30] can be applied. Let us examine\nthe separability properties of (in particular, three-party\nthree-mode) Gaussian states in more detail.\nIII.\n\n(3)\n\nk, l = 1, 2, 3, ..., 2N ,\n\nSEPARABILITY PROPERTIES OF\nGAUSSIAN STATES\n\nThe criteria by Giedke et al. [30] determine to which of\nfive possible classes of fully and partially separable, and\nfully inseparable states a three-party three-mode Gaussian state belongs. Hence genuine tripartite entanglement if present can be unambiguously identified. The\n\n\f3\nclassification is mainly based on the npt criterion for\ncv states. Transposition is a positive map that corresponds in phase space to a sign change of all momentum\nvariables, \u03be T \u2192 \u0393\u03be T = (x1 , \u2212p1 , x2 , \u2212p2 , ..., xN , \u2212pN )T\n[27]. In terms of the correlation matrix, we have then\nV (N ) \u2192 \u0393V (N ) \u0393. Since transposition is not a completely\npositive map, its partial application to a subsystem only\nmay yield an unphysical state when the subsystem was\nentangled to other subsystems. Expressing partial transposition of a bipartite Gaussian system by \u0393a \u2261 \u0393 \u2295 11\n(where A \u2295 B means the block-diagonal matrix with the\nmatrices A and B as diagonal 'entries', and A and B\nare respectively 2N \u00d7 2N and 2M \u00d7 2M square matrices\napplicable to N modes at a's side and M modes at b's\nside), the condition that the partially transposed Gaussian state described by \u0393a V (N +M) \u0393a is unphysical [see\nEq. (6)], \u0393a V (N +M) \u0393a \u0003 4i \u039b, is sufficient for the inseparability between a and b [27, 28]. For Gaussian states\nwith N = 1 and arbitrary M , this condition is sufficient\nand necessary [28]. The simplest example where the condition is no longer necessary for inseparability involves\ntwo modes at each side, N = M = 2. In that case, states\nwith positive partial transpose (bound entangled Gaussian states) exist [28]. For the general bipartite N \u00d7 M\ncase, there is also a sufficient and necessary condition:\nthe correlation matrix V (N +M) corresponds to a sepa(N )\nand\nrable state iff a pair of correlation matrices Va\n(N )\n(M)\n(M)\n(N +M)\nVb\nexists such that V\n\u2265 Va \u2295 Vb . Since it\nis in general hard to find such a pair of correlation ma(N )\n(M)\ntrices Va\nand Vb\nfor a separable state or to prove\nthe non-existence of such a pair for an inseparable state,\nthis criterion in not very practical. A more practical\nsolution was provided in Ref. [34]. The operational criteria there, computable and testable via a finite number\nof iterations, are entirely independent of the npt criterion. They rely on a nonlinear map between the correlation matrices rather than a linear one such as the partial transposition, and in contrast to the npt criterion,\nthey witness also the inseparability of bound entangled\nstates. Thus, the separability problem for bipartite Gaussian states with arbitrarily many modes at each side is\ncompletely solved. For three-party three-mode Gaussian\nstates, the only partially separable forms are those with\na bipartite splitting of 1 \u00d7 2 modes. Hence already the\nnpt criterion is sufficient and necessary.\nThe classification of tripartite three-mode Gaussian\nstates [30],\nclass 1 :\nclass 2 :\nclass 3 :\nclass 4 or 5 :\n\ni\n(3)\n\u039b , V\u03042 \u0003\n4\ni\n(3)\nV\u0304k \u2265 \u039b , V\u0304m(3) \u0003\n4\ni\n(3)\nV\u0304k \u2265 \u039b , V\u0304m(3) \u2265\n4\ni\n(3)\n(3)\nV\u03041 \u2265 \u039b , V\u03042 \u2265\n4\n(3)\n\nV\u03041\n\n\u0003\n\ni\n(3)\n\u039b , V\u03043 \u0003\n4\ni\n\u039b , V\u0304n(3) \u0003\n4\ni\n\u039b , V\u0304n(3) \u0003\n4\ni\n(3)\n\u039b , V\u03043 \u2265\n4\n\ni\n\u039b,\n4\ni\n\u039b,\n4\ni\n\u039b,\n4\ni\n\u039b,\n4\n(7)\n\n(3)\n\n\u2261\nis solely based on the npt criterion, where V\u0304j\n(3)\n\u0393j V \u0393j denotes the partial transposition with respect\nto one mode j. In classes 2 and 3, any permutation\nof modes (k, m, n) must be considered. Class 1 corresponds to the fully inseparable states. Class 5 shall\ncontain the fully separable states. For the fully separable Gaussian states if described by V (3) , one-mode cor(1)\n(1)\n(1)\nrelation matrices V1 , V2 , and V3 exist such that\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\nV (3) \u2265 V1 \u2295 V2 \u2295 V3 . In general, fully separable\nquantum states can P\nbe written as a mixture of tripartite product states,\ni \u03b7i \u03c1\u0302i,1 \u2297 \u03c1\u0302i,2 \u2297 \u03c1\u0302i,3 . In class 2,\nwe have the one-mode biseparable states, where only one\nparticular mode is separable from the remaining pair of\nmodes. This means in the Gaussian case that only for\n(1)\n(2)\none particular mode k, V (3) \u2265 Vk \u2295Vmn with some two(2)\nmode correlation matrix Vmn and one-mode correlation\n(1)\nmatrix\nVk . In general, such a state can be written as\nP\n\u03b7\n\u03c1\u0302\n\u2297 \u03c1\u0302i,mn for one mode k. Class 3 contains those\ni\ni,k\ni\nstates where two but not three bipartite splittings are\npossible, i.e., two different modes k and m are separable\nfrom the remaining pair of modes (two-mode biseparable states). The states of class 4 (three-mode biseparable\nstates) can be written as a mixture of products between\nany mode 1, 2, or 3 and the remaining pair of modes,\nbut not as a mixture of three-mode product states. Obviously, classes 4 and 5 are not distinguishable via the\nnpt criterion. An additional criterion for this distinction\nof class 4 and 5 Gaussian states is given in Ref. [30], de(1)\n(1)\nciding whether one-mode correlation matrices V1 , V2 ,\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\nand V3 exist such that V (3) \u2265 V1 \u2295 V2 \u2295 V3 . For\nthe identification of genuinely tripartite entangled Gaussian states, only class 1 has to be distinguished from the\nrest. Hence the npt criterion alone suffices.\nWhat about more than three parties and modes? Even\nfor only four parties and modes, the separability issue\nbecomes\nmore subtle. The one-mode bipartite splittings,\nP\n\u03b7\n\u03c1\u0302\n\u2297 \u03c1\u0302i,n , can be tested and possibly ruled out\ni\ni,klm\ni\nvia the npt criterion with respect to any mode n. In the\n(4)\nGaussian language, if V\u0304n \u0003 4i \u039b for any n, the state cannot be written in the above form. Since we consider here\nthe bipartite splitting of 1 \u00d7 3 modes, the npt condition\nis sufficient and necessary\nP for Gaussian states. However,\nalso a state of the form i \u03b7i \u03c1\u0302i,kl \u2297\u03c1\u0302i,mn leads to negative\npartial transpose with respect to any of the four modes\nwhen the two pairs (k, l) and (m, n) are each entangled.\nThus, npt with respect to any individual mode is necessary but not sufficient for genuine four-party entanglement. One has to consider also the partial transposition\nwith respect to any pair of modes. For this 2 \u00d7 2 mode\ncase, however, we know that entangled Gaussian states\nwith positive partial transpose exist [28]. But the npt\ncriterion is still sufficient for the inseparability between\nany two pairs. As for a sufficient and necessary condition,\none can use those from Ref. [34]. In any case, in order\nto confirm genuine four-party or even N -party entanglement, one has to rule out any possible partially separable\n\n\f4\nform. In principle, this can be done by considering all\npossible bipartite splittings (or groupings) and applying\neither the npt criterion or the stronger operational criteria from Ref. [34]. Although a full theoretical characterization including criteria for entanglement classification\nhas not been considered yet for more than three parties\nand modes, the presence of genuine multipartite entanglement can be confirmed, once the complete 2N \u00d7 2N\ncorrelation matrix is given.\nRather than detecting all the entries of the correlation\nmatrix we are aiming here at a simple check based on\nonly a few measurements, preferably efficient homodyne\ndetections. Even for larger numbers of parties, this check\nshould remain simple. Though it may not yield full information (e.g., the complete correlation matrix) about the\nquantum state of interest, it should still unambiguously\nverify the presence of genuine multipartite entanglement.\nThis check may prove the presence of entanglement indirectly through measurements after transforming the relevant state first into an appropriate form via linear optics.\n\nIV.\n\nDETECTING ENTANGLEMENT:\nBIPARTITE CASE\n\nIn the two-party two-mode case, the necessary separability condition for any cv state [35]\nh[\u2206(x\u03021 \u2212 x\u03022 )]2 i + h[\u2206(p\u03021 + p\u03022 )]2 i \u2265 2 |h[x\u0302, p\u0302]i| ,\n\n(8)\n\ncan be tested, for example, with a single beam splitter.\nThe position and momentum variables x\u0302l and p\u0302l (unitsfree with ~ = 21 , [x\u0302l , p\u0302k ] = i\u03b4lk /2) correspond to the\nquadratures of two electromagnetic modes, i.e., the real\nand imaginary parts of the annihilation operators of the\ntwo modes: \u00e2l = x\u0302l + ip\u0302l . The beam splitter provides\nthe suitable quadrature combinations for the positions\nand momenta simultaneously detectable at the two output ports. Without beam splitter, just by measuring\nfirst both positions and subtracting them electronically,\nand in a second step detecting both momenta and combining these electronically [36], a more direct test of the\ntwo-party condition is possible. However, instead of a\nsimultaneous detection of the relevant combinations, it\nrequires switching the two local oscillator phases from\nposition to momentum measurements. For an ensemble\nof identically prepared states, this sequence of detections\nwould still enable the application of the two-party condition. Note that the violation of Eq. (8) is only sufficient for inseparability, i.e., there are (even Gaussian) cv\nentangled states that satisfy Eq. (8). Any Gaussian cv\nstate, however, can be transformed via local operations\ninto a standard form and the presence of entanglement\nwould then always yield a violation [35] (alternatively,\none may modify the inequality and leave the Gaussian\nstate unchanged to obtain a sufficient and necessary condition [37]). The point is that the entanglement of states\nalready in this standard form (such as two-mode squeezed\n\nstates) can, in principle, always (for any nonzero squeezing) be verified experimentally by checking Eq. (8). A\nfull determination of the correlation matrix, including\nelements such as hx\u03021 p\u03022 i \u2212 hx\u03021 ihp\u03022 i which do not appear\nin the expressions of Eq. (8), is not required. Measuring also these elements may confirm that the state is in\nstandard form (when they are zero) and hence render the\ncondition Eq. (8) sufficient and necessary for separability. In any case, it would also enable quantification of\nthe entanglement [32, 33].\nThe combinations in condition Eq. (8) are exactly\nthose detected in a cv Bell measurement of modes 1 and\n2 [17]. Thus, the verification of non-maximum two-mode\ncv entanglement may rely on measurements of observables that are detected for the projection onto the maximally entangled cv basis of two modes. Now we investigate the N -party N -mode case in that respect.\nV.\n\nTHE CV GHZ BASIS\n\nLet us introduce the maximally entangled states\nZ \u221e\n1\n|\u03a8(v, u1 , u2 , ..., uN \u22121 )i = \u221a\ndx e2ivx\n\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\n\u00d7|xi \u2297 |x \u2212 u1 i \u2297 |x \u2212 u1 \u2212 u2 i\n\u2297* * *\u2297 |x \u2212 u1 \u2212 u2 \u2212 * * * \u2212 uN \u22121 i .\n(9)\nR\u221e\nSince \u2212\u221e |xihx| = 11 and hx|x\u2032 i = \u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 ), they form\na complete,\nZ \u221e\ndv du1 du2 * * * duN \u22121\n(10)\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2297N\n\n\u00d7|\u03a8(v, u1 , u2 , ..., uN \u22121 )ih\u03a8(v, u1 , u2 , ..., uN \u22121 )| = 11\nand orthogonal,\n\nh\u03a8(v, u1 , u2 , ..., uN \u22121 )|\u03a8(v \u2032 , u\u20321 , u\u20322 , ..., u\u2032N \u22121 )i\n(11)\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n= \u03b4(v \u2212 v )\u03b4(u1 \u2212 u1 )\u03b4(u2 \u2212 u2 ) * * * \u03b4(uN \u22121 \u2212 uN \u22121 ),\nset of basis states for N modes. In a \"cv GHZ state\nanalyzer\", determining the quantities v \u2261 p1 + p2 +\n* * * + pN , u1 \u2261 x1 \u2212 x2 , u2 \u2261 x2 \u2212 x3 ,..., and\nuN \u22121 \u2261 xN \u22121 \u2212 xN means projecting onto the basis\n{|\u03a8(v, u1 , u2 , ..., uN \u22121 )i}. This can be accomplish with\na sequence of beam splitters and homodyne detections\n[18, 19]. Inferring from the two-party case, we may conjecture that the N quadrature combinations given by\nv, u1 , u2 , ..., uN \u22121 provide a sufficient set of observables\nfor the verification of (possibly genuine) N -party entanglement. Just as for two parties, the variances of these\nquantities could then also be determined by combining\nthe results of direct x and p measurements electronically.\nIt was shown in Ref. [18, 19] that conditions for genuine\nmultipartite entanglement can be derived based on the\nabove N combinations and additional assumptions such\nas the purity and the total symmetry of the state in question. Later we derive a set of N \u22121 conditions for those N\n\n,\n\n\f5\ncombinations sufficient for the presence of genuine multipartite entanglement. This set is well suited for the\nexperimental confirmation of the genuine multi-party entanglement of cv GHZ-type states. No extra assumptions\nabout the state are needed in order to close the loophole\nof partial separability. First, we discuss now what the\nstructure of simple experimental criteria for multipartite\ncv entanglement might be.\nVI.\n\nDETECTING ENTANGLEMENT:\nTRIPARTITE CASE\n\nLet us consider three parties and modes. The goal is\nto extend the simple two-party two-mode entanglement\ncheck to a simple test for genuine three-party three-mode\nentanglement. The criteria are to be expressed in terms\nof the variances of quadrature linear combinations for the\nmodes involved. Defining\n\u00fb \u2261 h1 x\u03021 + h2 x\u03022 + h3 x\u03023 , v\u0302 \u2261 g1 p\u03021 + g2 p\u03022 + g3 p\u03023 , (12)\na fairly general ansatz is\nh(\u2206\u00fb)2 i\u03c1 + h(\u2206v\u0302)2 i\u03c1 \u2265 f (h1 , h2 , h3 , g1 , g2 , g3 ) , (13)\nas a potential necessary condition for an at least partially\nseparable state. The position and momentum variables\nx\u0302l and p\u0302l are the quadratures of the three electromagnetic\nmodes. The hl and gl are arbitrary real parameters. We\nwill prove the following statements for (at least partially)\nseparable states,\nX\n\u03b7i \u03c1\u0302i,12 \u2297 \u03c1\u0302i,3\n\u03c1\u0302 =\ni\n\n\u2192 f (hl , gl ) = (|h3 g3 | + |h1 g1 + h2 g2 |)/2 , (14)\nX\n\u03b7i \u03c1\u0302i,13 \u2297 \u03c1\u0302i,2\n\u03c1\u0302 =\ni\n\n\u2192 f (hl , gl ) = (|h2 g2 | + |h1 g1 + h3 g3 |)/2 , (15)\nX\n\u03b7i \u03c1\u0302i,23 \u2297 \u03c1\u0302i,1\n\u03c1\u0302 =\ni\n\n\u2192 f (hl , gl ) = (|h1 g1 | + |h2 g2 + h3 g3 |)/2 . (16)\n\nHere, for instance, \u03c1\u0302i,12 \u2297 \u03c1\u0302i,3 indicates that the threeparty density operator is a mixture of states i where parties (modes) 1 and 2 may be entangled or not, but party\n3 is not entangled with the rest. Hence also the fully\nseparable state is included in the above statements. In\nfact, for the fully separable state, we have\nX\n\u03b7i \u03c1\u0302i,1 \u2297 \u03c1\u0302i,2 \u2297 \u03c1\u0302i,3\n\u03c1\u0302 =\ni\n\n\u2192 f (hl , gl ) = (|h1 g1 | + |h2 g2 | + |h3 g3 |)/2,(17)\n\nwhich is always greater or equal than any of the boundaries in Eq.

Exploiting this form of\nthe state, we obtain hx\u0302k x\u0302n ii = hx\u0302k ii hx\u0302n ii , hx\u0302m x\u0302n ii =\nhx\u0302m ii hx\u0302n ii , and similarly for the terms involving p. Because modes k and m may be entangled in the states i,\nwe cannot replace hx\u0302k x\u0302m ii by hx\u0302k ii hx\u0302m ii , etc. By applying the Cauchy-SchwarzP\ninequality as P\nin the two-party\n2\n2\n\u2265\n(\nP\nh\u00fbi\nderivation of Ref.

Hence the statements in\nEq. (14) are proven when we consider the corresponding permutations of (k, m, n) = (1, 2, 3). The inequalities\nEq. (13) with Eq. (14), Eq. (15), and Eq. (16) represent\nnecessary conditions for all kinds of (partial) separability in a tripartite three-mode state. One may then prove\nthe presence of genuine tripartite entanglement through\nviolations of these inequalities, thus ruling out any (partially) separable form. Whether there are really three\ndifferent conditions required for the verification depends\non the choice of the coefficients hl and gl in the linear\ncombinations. For a particular choice, some of the conditions may coincide. For example,\n\u221a consider h1 = g1 = 1\nand g2 = g3 = \u2212h2 = \u2212h3 = 1/ 2 in Eq. (12). In this\ncase, the boundaries in Eq. (14) and Eq. (15) become\nidentical, f (hl , gl ) = 1/2. The boundary of Eq. (16) is\neven larger, f (hl , gl ) = 1, equivalent to that for a fully\nseparable state in Eq. (17). Hence the violation of a single condition,\n\u221a\nh{\u2206[x\u03021 \u2212 (x\u03022 + x\u03023 )/ 2]}2 i\u03c1\n\u221a\n+h{\u2206[p\u03021 + (p\u03022 + p\u03023 )/ 2]}2 i\u03c1 \u2265 1/2 ,\n(22)\n\nthe following. First, measure both quadratures x and p\nof all modes involved and combine them in an appropriate linear combination. The variances of these combinations may then yield violations of conditions necessary\nfor partial separability. Appropriate combinations are\nthose where the total variances for all partially separable\nstates have nonzero lower bounds and where the commutators of the combinations vanish. As for the derivation\nof the corresponding entanglement criteria, we employ\nthe following steps.\n1. Select a distinct pair of modes (m, n).\n2.

(29) and hence h(\u2206\u00fb)2 i\u03c1 +\nh(\u2206v\u0302)2 i\u03c1 \u2265 1.\nAs for a simple example, we may extend that from the\nprevious section to N modes and set h1 = g1 = 1 and\ng2 \u221a= g3 = * * * = gN = \u2212h2 = \u2212h3 = * * * = \u2212hN =\n1/ N \u2212 1. Without loss of generality, we choose m = 1\nand obtain for a state of the form Eq. (26),\nh(\u2206\u00fb)2 i\u03c1 + h(\u2206v\u0302)2 i\u03c1\nMr\n1 + Ms \u0011\n1\u0010\n1\u2212\n,\n+\n\u2265\n2\nN \u22121\nN \u22121\n\n(30)\n\nwhere Mr is the number of modes potentially entangled\nwith mode m = 1 in the convex sum and Ms is the number of modes potentially entangled with mode n in the\nconvex sum. Apart from the fully inseparable case Mr =\nN \u2212 1, the boundary in Eq. (30) is always greater than\nzero allowing for an ultimate nonzero bound for all kinds\nof partial separability. Since [\u00fb, v\u0302] = 0, genuine N -party\n\n\f8\nentanglement can be verified when h(\u2206\u00fb)2 i\u03c1 +h(\u2206v\u0302)2 i\u03c1 is\nsufficiently close to zero. The ultimate (smallest) bound\nis given by the state with the maximum number of modes\nMr inseparable from mode m = 1 in the convex sum,\nMr = N \u2212 2, and hence Ms = 0. This bound is then\n1/(N \u22121). If none of the modes is inseparable from mode\nm = 1, Mr = 0 and Ms = N \u2212 2, the boundary becomes\nsimply that of a fully separable state, namely one. Thus,\nagain the violation of a single condition,\n\u221a\nh{\u2206[x\u03021 \u2212 (x\u03022 + x\u03023 + * * * + x\u0302N )/ N \u2212 1]}2 i\u03c1\n\u221a\n+h{\u2206[p\u03021 + (p\u03022 + p\u03023 + * * * + p\u0302N )/ N \u2212 1]}2 i\u03c1\n\u2265 1/(N \u2212 1) ,\n(31)\nis sufficient for genuine N -partite entanglement. As an\nexample for the violation of the ultimate bound for genuine N -party entanglement, consider the N -mode state\nthat emerges after symmetrically splitting one half of an\ninfinitely squeezed two-mode squeezed state by N \u2212 2\nbeam splitters. The output state is a simultaneous eigenstate of \u00fb and v\u0302. In this case, the EPR correlations,\nx\u03021 \u2212 x\u03022 \u2192 0 and p\u03021 + p\u03022 \u2192 0, are transformed\n\u221a into the\n\u2032\n\u2032\nN \u22121\u21920\nN -mode correlations x\u03021 \u2212(x\u0302\u20322 +x\u0302\n+*\n*\n*+x\u0302\n)/\nN\n\u221a3\nand p\u03021 + (p\u0302\u20322 + p\u0302\u20323 + * * * + p\u0302\u2032N )/ N \u2212 1 \u2192 0. A more symmetric example is where both halves of an EPR state\nare symmetrically split at beam splitters. The appropriate combinations are then for instance for four modes,\nx\u0302\u20321 + x\u0302\u20322 \u2212 x\u0302\u20323 \u2212 x\u0302\u20324 and p\u0302\u20321 + p\u0302\u20322 + p\u0302\u20323 + p\u0302\u20324 , also having\nzero commutator [\u00fb, v\u0302] = 0.

By choosing the squeezing direction of one\ndistinct input mode orthogonal to that of the remaining\ninput modes (mode 1 squeezed in p and the other modes\nsqueezed in x, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2 for N = 3)\nand the degree of squeezing r1 of mode 1 potentially different from that of the other modes (which are equally\nsqueezed by r2 ) [39], the output states have the following\nproperties [18, 19].

However, the states\nof this form are in general biased with respect to x and\np (a 6= b).

The other N -mode states of the family can be converted into the minimum-energy state via local squeezing operations [18, 19, 39]. Only for N = 2, we obtain\nr = r1 = r2 . In that case, the matrix V (N ) reduces to\nthat of a two-mode squeezed state which is the maximally entangled state of two modes at a given mean energy with the correlation matrix entries a = b = cosh 2r\nand c = sinh 2r = \u2212d.

Due\nto experimental imperfections, we may assume that the\nentanglement of slightly degraded approximate versions\nof the states generated according to a scheme as in Figs. 1\nand 2 is to be verified. We start again with only three\nparties and modes. For a simple check, look at the fol-\n\nI.\nh[\u2206(x\u03021 \u2212 x\u03022 )]2 i + h[\u2206(p\u03021 + p\u03022 + g3 p\u03023 )]2 i \u2265 1 ,\nII. h[\u2206(x\u03022 \u2212 x\u03023 )]2 i + h[\u2206(g1 p\u03021 + p\u03022 + p\u03023 )]2 i \u2265 1 ,\nIII. h[\u2206(x\u03021 \u2212 x\u03023 )]2 i + h[\u2206(p\u03021 + g2 p\u03022 + p\u03023 )]2 i \u2265 1 .\n(38)\nOn the l.h.s. of condition I., we have h1 = \u2212h2 = g1 =\ng2 = 1 and h3 = 0, and hence the boundary for the\ntotal variance in Eq. (13) becomes one with Eq. (15) and\nEq. (16), but zero with Eq. (14). Similarly, using the\nl.h.s. of condition II., where h2 = \u2212h3 = g2 = g3 = 1 and\nh1 = 0, the boundary is one for Eq.

(38) are necessary for different\nkinds of partial separability. As a result, the violation\nof any pair of inequalities in Eq. (38) is sufficient for\ngenuine three-party three-mode entanglement. Violating only one condition in Eq. (38) (for example, condition I.) means that the total density operator cannot\n\n\f10\nbe written in two of the three forms\nP in Eq. (39) (for\nexample, neither in\nthe\nform\n\u03c1\u0302\n=\ni \u03b7i \u03c1\u0302i,13 \u2297 \u03c1\u0302i,2 nor\nP\nin the form \u03c1\u0302 =\ni \u03b7i \u03c1\u0302i,23 \u2297 \u03c1\u0302i,1 ). Using the classification of Ref. [30], the classes 3 [two-mode biseparable\nstates expressible in two of the three forms in Eq. (39)],\n4 [three-mode biseparable states expressible in all of the\nthree forms in Eq. (39)], and 5 [fully separable states describable by Eq. (17)] are then ruled out. The forms\nof the classes 1 (fully inseparable states) and 2 [onemode biseparable states expressible in one of the three\nforms in Eq. (39)] remain both possible. In our example with the violation of I., the state might be genuinely\ntripartite\nentangled or of the partially separable form\nP\n\u03c1\u0302 = i \u03b7i \u03c1\u0302i,12 \u2297 \u03c1\u0302i,3 . Eventually, the violation of a second inequality in Eq. (38) (for instance, condition II.)\nnegates also\nP the only remaining partially separable form\n(e.g., \u03c1\u0302 = i \u03b7i \u03c1\u0302i,12 \u2297 \u03c1\u0302i,3 ), thus proving the full inseparability of the state [40]. Note that even though pure\nand totally symmetric multi-party entangled states are\nalways genuinely multipartite entangled [18, 19], asymmetric pure or mixed entangled three-mode states (e.g.,\nfrom class 2 in Ref. [30], the product state of a bipartite entangled two-mode squeezed state and a vacuum\nstate) and symmetric mixed entangled three-mode states\n(like the example for the three-mode biseparable class,\nclass 4, given in Ref. [30]) do not automatically exhibit\ngenuine tripartite entanglement. Due to the violation of\ntwo conditions in Eq. (38), the two loopholes of partial\nseparability, mixedness and/or asymmetry, are ruled out.\nThe criteria here are only sufficient for full inseparability and hence genuinely tripartite entangled states may\nalso satisfy all the conditions in Eq. (38) (an example will\nbe mentioned later). On the other hand, note that we did\nnot use the assumption of Gaussian states. The derivation of the conditions relies only on the Cauchy-Schwarz\ninequality and Heisenberg's (sum) uncertainty relation.\nAlternatively, one could simply check the known bipartite separability conditions [35] for pairs of modes,\ni.e., g1 = g2 = g3 = 0 in Eq. (38) (or using products of\nvariances [38] instead of sums). Again, the statements\nin Eq. (39) hold. Hence two violations again verify genuine tripartite entanglement. However, the significance\nof the more general conditions in Eq. (38) compared to\nthose with g1 = g2 = g3 = 0 is that for the cv GHZ-type\nstates, as discussed later, the former can be always violated for any degree of multi-party entanglement and the\nviolations can steadily grow from small towards \"perfect\"\n(that is all variances of the combinations zero) as the\nthree-mode entanglement increases. In contrast, the bipartite conditions with g1 = g2 = g3 = 0 may be violated\nfor bad three-mode entanglement (small squeezing) and\nsatisfied for larger squeezing, thus not always verifying\ngenuine tripartite entanglement, and in particular never\nverifying good genuine tripartite entanglement. Moreover, they might be always violated, but the violations do\nnot attain a significant amount (e.g., three-mode states\nmade from one squeezed state [18, 19]). Similarly, using products of variances [38] instead of sums in Eq. (38)\n\nwith g1 = g2 = g3 = 0, violations may always occur,\nbut also only to a certain extent [18, 19]. In Figs. 1 and\n2, it is shown how to apply the tripartite entanglement\ncriteria experimentally using homodyne detectors.\nLet us also discuss the conditions for the N = 4 case\nin more detail. We consider a set of six inequalities,\nI. h[\u2206(x\u03021 \u2212 x\u03022 )]2 i + h[\u2206(p\u03021 + p\u03022 + g3 p\u03023 + g4 p\u03024 )]2 i \u2265 1,\nII. h[\u2206(x\u03022 \u2212 x\u03023 )]2 i + h[\u2206(g1 p\u03021 + p\u03022 + p\u03023 + g4 p\u03024 )]2 i \u2265 1,\nIII. h[\u2206(x\u03021 \u2212 x\u03023 )]2 i + h[\u2206(p\u03021 + g2 p\u03022 + p\u03023 + g4 p\u03024 )]2 i \u2265 1,\nIV. h[\u2206(x\u03023 \u2212 x\u03024 )]2 i + h[\u2206(g1 p\u03021 + g2 p\u03022 + p\u03023 + p\u03024 )]2 i \u2265 1,\nV. h[\u2206(x\u03022 \u2212 x\u03024 )]2 i + h[\u2206(g1 p\u03021 + p\u03022 + g3 p\u03023 + p\u03024 )]2 i \u2265 1,\nVI. h[\u2206(x\u03021 \u2212 x\u03024 )]2 i + h[\u2206(p\u03021 + g2 p\u03022 + g3 p\u03023 + p\u03024 )]2 i \u2265 1.\n(40)\nThe position and momentum variables x\u0302l and p\u0302l are\nthe quadratures of four electromagnetic modes this time.\nThe gl are again arbitrary real parameters.

The above statements can\nbe easily confirmed using Eq. (29) for states of the general form Eq. (26). The different\nP forms here are \u03c1\u0302 =\nP\n\u2297 \u03c1\u0302i,m \u2297 \u03c1\u0302i,n ,\ni \u03b7i \u03c1\u0302i,klm\nP \u2297 \u03c1\u0302i,n , including \u03c1\u0302 = i \u03b7i \u03c1\u0302i,kl P\nand \u03c1\u0302 = i \u03b7i \u03c1\u0302i,km \u2297 \u03c1\u0302i,ln , including \u03c1\u0302 = i \u03b7i \u03c1\u0302i,km \u2297\n\u03c1\u0302i,l \u2297 \u03c1\u0302i,n , with the two modes m and n always being separable. For the combinations \u00fb = x\u0302m \u2212 x\u0302n and\nv\u0302 = gk p\u0302k + gl p\u0302l + p\u0302m + p\u0302n , the boundary of the total variance is always one. The statements Eq. (41), Eq. (42),\nand Eq. (43) become obvious then by considering all possible pairs of modes (m, n) of the four modes (k, l, m, n).\nNote that always when the two modes (m, n) are potentially entangled, the boundary for the total variance\ndrops to zero.\nWhat kind of violations of the six inequalities in\nEq. (40) are now sufficient to verify the full inseparability of a four-mode four-party state? The violations must\nrule out any of the partially separable forms in Eq. (41),\nEq. (42), and Eq. (43). Let us, for example, consider\nviolations of the inequalities IV. and V. These violations mean that all partially separable forms in Eq. (41),\nEq. (42),\nP and Eq. (43) are excluded except for the form\n\u03c1\u0302 = i \u03b7i \u03c1\u0302i,234 \u2297 \u03c1\u0302i,1 in Eq. (41). In order to negate this\nform as well a further violation is needed. According to\nEq. (41), one of the inequalities I., III., or VI. should be\nviolated in addition. Here it is important to realize that\nthe conditions IV. and V. do not involve the x quadrature\nof mode 1, but that of all the other modes. The additional test via any one of the conditions I., III., or VI., of\nwhich all contain both quadratures of mode 1, eventually\nprovides the missing information about mode 1. Hence\nwe learn that three conditions are sufficient here to verify the full inseparability of a four-mode four-party state.\nWe may choose\nh[\u2206(x\u03021 \u2212 x\u03022 )]2 i + h[\u2206(p\u03021 + p\u03022 + g3 p\u03023 + g4 p\u03024 )]2 i < 1,\nh[\u2206(x\u03022 \u2212 x\u03023 )]2 i + h[\u2206(g1 p\u03021 + p\u03022 + p\u03023 + g4 p\u03024 )]2 i < 1,\nh[\u2206(x\u03023 \u2212 x\u03024 )]2 i + h[\u2206(g1 p\u03021 + g2 p\u03022 + p\u03023 + p\u03024 )]2 i < 1,\n(44)\nwhich involve both quadratures x and p of all four modes.\nNote that apart from the coefficients gl , these four combinations correspond to those observables measured in a\nfour-party cv GHZ state analyzer. Correspondingly, for\nN parties and modes, we may choose the following N \u2212 1\nconditions in terms of effectively N combinations (those\nof an N -party N -mode cv GHZ state analyzer),\nh[\u2206(x\u03021 \u2212 x\u03022 )]2 i\n+h[\u2206(p\u03021 + p\u03022 + g3 p\u03023 + * * * + gN p\u0302N )]2 i < 1,\nh[\u2206(x\u03022 \u2212 x\u03023 )]2 i\n+h[\u2206(g1 p\u03021 + p\u03022 + p\u03023 + g4 p\u03024 + * * * + gN p\u0302N )]2 i < 1,\n..\n..\n..\n..\n..\n..\n..\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n2\nh[\u2206(x\u0302N \u22121 \u2212 x\u0302N )] i\n+h[\u2206(g1 p\u03021 + g2 p\u03022 + * * * + gN \u22122 p\u0302N \u22122 + p\u0302N \u22121 + p\u0302N )]2 i\n< 1.\n(45)\n\n30\n1\n30\n\n0.8\n3\n\n0.6\n30\n\n0.4\n\n3\n3\n\n0.2\n0\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\nsqueezing r\n\n1\n\nFIG. 3: Plot of the left-hand-side (total variance) of the conditions in Eq. (45) for different N -mode states with quadrature correlations given by Eq. (36) and different numbers of\nparties N = 3 and N = 30. The states are those produced\nwith one squeezed state (dotted lines with r2 = 0 and r = r1 ),\nthose made from N equally squeezed states (dashed lines with\nr = r1 = r2 ), and the unbiased minimum-energy states with\nsqueezing r1 and r = r2 related as in Eq. (34).\n\nThese conditions are sufficient to verify the full inseparability (genuine N -party entanglement) of an N -party\nN -mode state. For arbitrary N , the proof relies on the\nfact that in any partially separable form we may always\nselect a distinct pair of modes (m, n) which are separable\nin the states i of the convex sum of the density operator.\nOnly exploiting that modes m and n are separable, the\ncombinations\n\u00fb = x\u0302m \u2212 x\u0302n ,\n\nv\u0302 =\n\nN\n\u22122\nX\n\ngkj p\u0302kj + p\u0302m + p\u0302n ,\n\n(46)\n\nj=1\n\nalways yield a boundary of one for the total variance\nusing Eq. (29) for states of the general form Eq. (26). By\ntaking the pairs of modes (1, 2), (2, 3), ..., (N \u2212 1, N ) for\n(m, n), all partially separable forms of the total density\noperator are covered (as demonstrated explicitly for N =\n4) and hence the N \u22121 conditions in Eq. (45) are sufficient\nfor genuine N -party N -mode inseparability.\nThe left-hand-side of the inequalities in Eq. (45) is\nshown in Fig.3 for various cv GHZ-type N -mode states\ndiffering in the relation between the squeezing r1 and\nr2 [Eq. (32), Eq. (33), and Eq. (36)]. Due to the total\nsymmetry of all these states, the left-hand-side of the\nconditions in Eq. (45) becomes equal for all conditions\n(assuming gj \u2261 g (N ) ). Hence values below the boundary\n1 here mean all inequalities in Eq. (45) are satisfied, thus\nindicating genuine N -party entanglement. In all cases in\n(N )\nFig. 3, the optimal coefficients gj \u2261 gopt from Eq. (37)\nare used to minimize the total variances of Eq. (36). If\nN = 30, only for the unbiased states, the conditions are\nalways met (for any nonzero squeezing r > 0) and the\ntotal variances tend to zero for large squeezing. Moreover, for the same squeezing r, the unbiased states with\nN = 30 drop below the boundary 1 to a greater extent\n\n\f12\nthan their unbiased tripartite counterparts. In contrast,\nfor the biased states (those with only one squeezer, r2 = 0\nand r = r1 , and those with N equally squeezed states,\nr = r1 = r2 ), the total variances approach or even exceed the boundary 1 as the number of parties grows. The\nexample of the states with N equal squeezers also demonstrates that there are Gaussian states which are indeed\ngenuinely N -party entangled, but do not satisfy any of\nthe conditions in Eq. (45). It can be shown, however, taking into account the symmetry and purity of the whole\nfamily of N -mode states (including those with N equal\nsqueezers) that all these states are genuinely multi-party\nentangled for any nonzero squeezing [18, 19].\nFinally, we emphasize that one may use other conditions too for verifying the genuine multipartite entanglement of the cv GHZ-type states. Even a single condition\nmight be again sufficient. For example, consider the combinations \u00fb = 2x\u03021 \u2212 (x\u03022 + x\u03023 ) and v\u0302 = p\u03021 + p\u03022 + p\u03023 for\nthree modes. We have [\u00fb, v\u0302] = 0, and indeed the GHZtype three-mode state becomes a simultaneous eigenstate\nof \u00fb and v\u0302 in the limit of infinite squeezing, r1 , r2 \u2192 \u221e.\nThe boundaries of the total variance P\nfor these combinationsP\ntake on the value one when \u03c1\u0302 = i \u03b7i \u03c1\u0302i,12 \u2297 \u03c1\u0302i,3 or\n\u03c1\u0302 = i \u03b7i \u03c1\u0302i,13 \u2297 \u03c1\u0302i,2 , and the value two\nP(corresponding\nto the fully separable state) when \u03c1\u0302 = i \u03b7i \u03c1\u0302i,23 \u2297 \u03c1\u0302i,1 .\nHence h(\u2206\u00fb)2 i\u03c1 + h(\u2206v\u0302)2 i\u03c1 < 1 is sufficient for genuine\ntripartite entanglement. The number of measurements\nrequired, however, remain the same as for the criteria\nabove expressed by N \u2212 1 conditions. In any case, both\nquadratures of all modes must be detected and combined\nin an appropriate way.\nIX.\n\norder to confirm the genuine multipartite entanglement.\nFurthermore, the conditions here do not rely on the assumption of Gaussian states. An experimental confirmation of the Gaussian character of the state in question\nis therefore not needed either. Finally, we examined the\napplicability of the conditions to a particular GHZ-type\nclass of genuinely multi-party entangled states. These\nstates are of Gaussian form, they are totally symmetric\nunder exchange of modes, and they have zero cross correlations between the x and the p quadratures. If they are\nin addition unbiased between the x and the p quadratures, they always (for any nonzero entanglement) satisfy the conditions in terms of appropriately chosen linear combinations. In the limit of perfect entanglement,\nthe variances of the combinations tend to zero for the\nunbiased states and the conditions are perfectly met.\nIn an experiment, one normally has approximate a priori knowledge about the state to be analyzed. According\nto this a priori knowledge, one can then choose appropriate linear combinations to be measured. It would be\ndesirable to know whether there is always, for any given\nmulti-party multi-mode state, a single optimal condition\nto verify its genuine multipartite entanglement and how\nto constructively derive this condition. Inferring from\nthe results here, such a condition may always exist and\nthe corresponding linear combinations must contain both\nquadratures of all modes with optimized coefficients hl\nand gl . A possible approach to this question is in terms\nof so-called entanglement witnesses [26, 41]. One may\nthen interpret the inequalities for the total variances\nas quantum expectation values of Hermitian operators\nwhich take on negative values when they witness some\nkind of partial inseparability.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn summary, we proposed experimental criteria to detect genuine multipartite continuous-variable entanglement. These are expressed in terms of the variances of\nparticular combinations of all the quadratures involved.\nThe combinations are measurable with only a few simple\nhomodyne detections. For Gaussian states, it is then not\nnecessary to determine the entire correlation matrix in\n\nAcknowledgements: PvL is grateful to Masahide\nSasaki, Masahiro Takeoka, Marcos Curty, Norbert\nL\u00fctkenhaus, and Samuel Braunstein for useful discussions.

[10]\nare also consistent with mixtures of entangled two-mode\nstates\nand a separable third mode, for example \u03c1\u0302 =\nP\ni \u03b7i \u03c1\u0302i,12 \u2297 \u03c1\u0302i,3 . The improvement in the performance\nof \"controlled dense coding\" between the two entangled\nparties due to classical information about one quadrature (say p\u03023 ) of the third mode/party can be explained\nsolely by classical correlations between the third mode\nand the entangled pair. Although the states produced in\nRef. [10] certainly are genuinely tripartite entangled, the\nexperimental verification of this genuine tripartite entanglement is incomplete. The additional measurement required for the complete verification corresponds to the\nviolation of a second inequality, for instance condition II.\nin Eq. (38), involving also the conjugate quadrature (say\nx\u03023 ) of the third mode. Operationally, this would mean\nthat an additional \"controlled dense coding\" between a\nsecond pair of modes (for example, modes 2 and 3) must\nbe demonstrated.\n[41] B. M. Terhal, Phys. Lett.
