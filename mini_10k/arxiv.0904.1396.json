Their recent experimental realization with lattice\nconstants below 100 nanometers stresses the urgency of a thorough understanding of their electronic properties.

Various graphene-based\napplications have been realized in recent years4,5 and the\nrelevance for application in devices is heavily increased by\nthe rapidly improving ability to pattern monolayer films\nwith e-beam lithography1 where features on the ten-nm\nscale have been obtained6,7 . Moreover, recent advances\nin chemical vapor deposition of graphene (see e.g. Ref.\n[8]) are promising for fabrication of large area, high quality devices.\nYet another way of nanoengineering graphene consists\nof defining an antidot lattice on graphene by means of\na regular array of nanoscale perforations. This theoretical idea was introduced by Pedersen et al.9,10 , who\nshowed using tight-binding calculations that antidot lattices change the electronic properties from semimetallic to semiconducting with a significant and controllable\nband gap. Such structures have recently been realized\nexperimentally by Shen et al.11 and Eroms et al.12 with\nlattice spacings down to 80 nm. Quantum dots and\ngraphene ribbons have been demonstrated with dimensions of only a few nm13 . Very recently, Girit et al.14 have\nstudied the dynamics at the edges of a growing hole in\nreal time using a transmission electron microscope. Both\nin the experiment and in Monte Carlo simulations they\nfind the zig-zag edge formation to be the most stable\nstructure. This is in agreement with the findings of Jia\net al.15 who demonstrate a method to produce graphitic\nnanoribbon edges in a controlled manner via Joule heating. This opens the possibility of making antidot lattices\n\nwith a desired hole geometry.\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) The unit cell of the {4, 2} (left) and\n{6, 5}\u25b3 (right) system. The hexagonally shaped unit cells are\nrepeated in plane to form a honeycomb lattice of antidots.\nThe carbon atoms (green) are hydrogen terminated (white)\nalong the hole edges.\n\nWhile carbon nanotubes, graphene and recently\ngraphene ribbons have been studied extensively using\nfirst principles methods, antidot lattices in graphene have\nmainly been treated with simpler models9,16 . The very\nrecent work by Vanevic et al.16 uses a \u03c0-orbital tightbinding model to study antidot lattices with rather large\nlattice constants (these systems are more easily accessed\nexperimentally but cannot be analyzed in terms of ab initio methods). Their focus is on the possible occurrence\nof midgap states without introducing defects in the antidot lattice, as was the case in the original proposal by\nPedersen et al.\nMany studies on magnetization have been reported for\nvarious graphene structures17,18,19,20,21,22 . The origin of\nthe magnetism can be understood based on the theory\n\n\f2\nby Lieb17 , and the subsequent related work by Inui et\nal.23 on the properties of the bipartite lattice. Single\nvacancies and their spin properties have been studied\nby, e.g. Lehtinen et al.18 and Palacios et al.19 ; the latter paper also investigates voids in both graphene and\ngraphene ribbons in detail using a mean-field Hubbardmodel. Magnetization has also been studied in carved\nslits20 , finite ribbons21 and flakes21,22 as well as rings24\nand notches25 . Recently, DFT treatments of magnetic\nproperties of nano-holes in graphene26 and graphene\nfilms27 have been published.\nThe realized antidot lattices with hole sizes of several\ntens of nanometers and even larger lattice spacings involve several thousands of atoms in a unit cell and are\ncomputationally too costly to be treated with DFT in\na systematic manner. The DFT based tight-binding\nmethod, DFTB28 , however, allows one to address such\nlarge systems. The difference in computational cost between DFT and DFTB is for the present study found to\nbe at least a factor of thirty. We thus investigate the\naccuracy of DFTB compared to DFT on much smaller\nantidot lattices in terms of the band structures32 . Since\ngeometry relaxation is the most costly task in DFT we\nalso investigate the cost benefits of combining the two\nmethods. By using DFT and elaborating on the role of\nspin, we also wish to address some of the main features\nfound specifically for antidot lattices on a tight-binding\nlevel of the theory.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we introduce the antidot lattice systems and the methods used.\nThe equilibrium geometries and band structures obtained\nusing both DFT and DFTB and a combination thereof is\ngiven in Sec. III together with a detailed investigation of\nthe spin properties. We conclude with a short summary.\n\nII.\n\nSYSTEMS AND METHOD\n\nThe specific realization of the antidot lattice we consider in this paper is a hexagonal (triangular) array of\nholes in a graphene sheet as proposed by Pedersen et al.9 .\nWithin the hexagonal unit cells there can be different hole\ngeometries, and two examples of high symmetry holes\nare shown in Fig. 1. Below, geometries are fully relaxed\nbut as a starting point ideal geometries using fixed bond\nlengths and angles of 120\u25e6 are constructed. These geometries furthermore provide a straightforward notation\nfor the structures. Thus, we designate antidot lattices\nwith circular holes according to the notation {L, R} ,\nwhere L is the side length of the unit cell and R the\nhole radius, both measured in units of the graphene lattice constant a=2.46 \u00c5 giving a C-C bond length of 1.42\n\u00c5. Similarly, for triangular holes, we apply the notation\n{L, D}\u25b3 , where D denotes the side length of the hole16 .\nThe holes are passivated with H using a C-H bond length\nof 1.1 \u00c5 and consist almost entirely of zig-zag edges.\nThese structures are idealized but may well be within\nexperimental reach given the recent advancements14,15 .\n\nRelaxation\n{4, 2}\n{5, 2.8}\n{5, 3.5}\n{6, 3.6}\n{6, 5}\u25b3\n\nNone\n0.93\n0.72\n1.27\n0.39\n0.24\n\nDFT\nNon-spin DFT\nDFT DFTB\nDFTB\n1.01 0.97\n0.97\n0.84 0.79\n0.79\n1.51 1.35\n1.35\n0.52 0.46\n0.46\n0.22 0.22\n0.00\n\nDFTB\nNone DFTB\n0.99 1.05\n0.88 0.98\n1.72 1.74\n0.65 0.75\n0.00 0.00\n\nTABLE I: The band gaps for various systems calculated with\neither DFT or DFTB using geometries obtained with different\nmethods for relaxation. All values are in eV.\n\nFor the first principles calculations we have used the\nab initio pseudopotential DFT as implemented in the\nSiesta code29 to obtain the electronic structure and\nrelaxed atomic positions from spin-polarized DFT33 .\nWe employ the GGA PBE functional for exchangecorrelation30.\nFor the DFTB results34 , we use the original (C,H)\nparametrization of Porezag et al.28 which does not include spin.\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nFor all considered structures a structural relaxation\nwith DFT leads to a shrinking of the hole, of the order\nof 1 %, resulting in C-C bonds close to the edges stretching and contracting in the range of 1.39 - 1.45 (1.43 for\n{5, 3.5} ) \u00c5. A few bond lengths away from the hole\nedge the C-C bond length remains unaltered at 1.42 \u00c5.\nIn the case of relaxation with DFTB the picture is quite\nsimilar. Edge-atom C-C bond lengths vary from 1.391.42 \u00c5 for all systems but {6, 5}\u25b3, which has variations\nof 1.38 - 1.44 \u00c5. The shrinking of the hole size is smaller\nthan 1%.\nThe results for the band gaps for five different systems\nare summarized in Table I. The band structures are calculated using both DFT and DFTB on structures relaxed\nat different accuracy levels and thus at different computational costs. The combinations are not exhaustive but\nrepresent a relevant set aimed at saving computational\ncosts. The relaxation type is given in the second row of\nTable I. DFTB is expected to match DFT better as L/R\nincreases due to decreased importance of edge details.\nThe systems chosen here are mostly edge-dominated (low\nL/R ratio) and thus represent the worst case scenario.\nUsing DFT we find band gaps ranging from 0.2 to\n1.5 eV confirming that the antidot lattice turns the\nsemimetallic graphene into a semiconductor9 . However,\nonly spin-polarized DFT predicts a band gap for the\n{6, 5}\u25b3 structure which will be discussed in detail below.\nPedersen et al.9 demonstrated a scaling-law between\nthe hole size and the band gap for large L/R ratios but no\nsuch simple picture for small L/R ratios emerged. This\n\n\f3\nsystem becomes. The change using DFT for the {4, 2}\nsystem is 8 % compared to 16 % for {5, 3.5} .\nIt must be emphasized that larger differences between\ninitial and relaxed geometries may well give rise to a\nlarger discrepancy between their band gaps. However,\neven for the case of a single passivated edge-defect the\ndifference in relaxed and unrelaxed DFT band gaps is\nless than 10 %.\n\n2\n\n{5,2.8}\u039f\n\n1\n\n{4,2}O\n\n{6,3.6}\u2206\n\n{4,2}O\n\n0\n\n{6,5}\u2206\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n1.5\n\nDFT band gap [eV]\nFIG. 2: (Color online) The band gaps for DFTB, DFT on\nDFTB-relaxed geometry and DFT on unrelaxed geometry\nplotted versus pure DFT results.

The\nclear trend is that relaxation increases the band gap.\nThis is illustrated for DFT in Fig. 2 (crosses corresponding to the unrelaxed structure lie below the dotted line),\nas well as in Table I for DFTB. Comparing unrelaxed\nresults with fully relaxed results we see from Table I a\nchange in band gaps within 10 % and 15 % using DFTB\nand DFT, respectively.

This tendency is enhanced the more edgelike the structure becomes. On average, the DFTB gap\nis 20% larger than the DFT value for the four structures\nwith circular perforations. The discrepancy increases for\nstructures with holes occupying a large portion of the\nunit cell, such as {5, 3.5} . Moreover, for {6, 5}\u25b3 the\nomission of spin effects leads incorrectly to a vanishing\nDFTB band gap in agreement with non-spin DFT. In the\ncases of the {4, 2} and {6, 5}\u25b3 systems the band structures are shown in Fig. 3 left and right, respectively, calculated using DFT (DFTB) in the upper(lower) panel.\nWe see that the shape of the bands corresponds qualitatively for the two methods.\n\n{6,5}\u2206\n\n-0.5\n\u0393\n\nM\n\nK\n\n-1\nK\n\n\u0393\n\nM\n\nK\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Band structures for the {4, 2} (left\ncolumn) and {6, 5}\u25b3 (right column) systems using DFTB (upper panels) and DFT (lower panels). The dotted blue curves\nin the lower panels are DFT results using structures relaxed\nwith DFTB. The arrow pointing up (down) indicates that\nbands are filled with majority (minority) electrons only.\n\nBy relaxing the geometry with DFTB the DFT results are improved from the non-relaxed case as shown in\nFig. 2 (the squares are closer to the dashed line than the\ncrosses). Compared to pure DFT the largest difference\nin the band gap is again found for the edge-dominated\n{5, 3.5} system: it is now 11 % compared to 16 % without relaxation. For the larger {6, 5}\u25b3 structure we find\nthe same values as for pure DFT. The DFT results are\nshown for both DFT-relaxed and DFTB-relaxed structures on Fig. 3 indicated by thick and dotted line, respectively. The different geometries do not change the\nbands notably.\nUsing DFT on DFTB-relaxed structures is thus an approach with a good trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. This finding is of great practical use,\nsince relaxation is very costly in DFT.\nB.\n\nMagnetic properties\n\nFor the {6, 5}\u25b3 system with both non-spin-DFT and\nDFTB there are three (one nearly doubly degenerate)\nbands with weak dispersion at zero energy. Introducing\n\n\f4\nspin leads to a clear splitting of these bands, i.e., to the\nformation of a band gap. For a comparison of DFT and\nDFTB, see Fig. 3, right column. The three bands below (above) the Fermi level are half-filled by majority\n(minority) spin electrons and are thus completely spinpolarized. The size of the band gap is thus also an indication of the robustness of the magnetic state31 .\nThe magnetic moments of the structures can be un-\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) The difference in majority spin and\nminority spin densities for the {6, 5}\u25b3 structure.

According to Lieb's theorem17 , the total magnetic moment can be written as M = NA \u2212 NB where\nNA(B) is the number of atoms occupying the A(B) sites of\nthe bipartite graphene lattice. Thus, if the angle between\nthe zigzag edges is 0\u25e6 or 60\u25e6 the edge-atoms belong to the\nsame sublattice, while they belong to different sublattices\nif the angle is 120\u25e6 or 180\u25e6 . Consequently, the hexagonal hole is non-magnetic and the triangular is magnetic.\nThis is consistent with a Mulliken analysis from the DFT\ncalculations which shows a non-zero magnetic moment\nonly for the {6, 5}\u25b3 system of 3.00 \u03bcB per unit cell. By\ninspection of the geometry we indeed find NA \u2212 NB =3.\nAs a continuation of Lieb's work, Inui et al.23 showed\nthat such sublattice imbalance results in there being\nNA \u2212 NB midgap states with zero energy. We thus expect a degeneracy of 3 of the low-dispersion bands in the\n{6, 5}\u25b3 case.\nIn Fig. 3, lower right panel, there is one largely dispersionless band just below two almost completely degenerate bands which have some dispersion especially at\nthe \u0393-point. Such band curvature was also found for hydrogenated graphene ribbons by Kusakabe et al.31 The\n\n\u0393-point states for each band are shown in Fig. 4, where\nthe strong localization is seen for the lowest band, Fig.\n4(c), whereas the bands with curvature, Fig. 4(a,b), yield\nless localized states. Note also the alternation in the amplitudes of the states between sublattices as proposed\nby Inui et al.23 The state of the highest occupied (spindegenerate) band for the non-magnetic {6, 3.6} structure is shown for comparison in Fig. 4(d). The splitting\nas well as the curvature is less pronounced for the unfilled\nstates above the Fermi level showing particle-hole asymmetry. This asymmetry is expected due to the breaking\nof the symmetry of the bipartite lattice partly due to\nthe DFT treatment beyond nearest neighbor as well as\nthe passivation of the edges which changes the on-site\npotential at edge-sites. This is inherently also the case\nfor DFTB. By inspection of the SIESTA Hamiltonian29\nwe find an increase in on-site energy for passivated edge\natoms as compared to atoms far from the edge. Vanevic\net al.16 find that a potential shift on the edge-atoms\nmainly causes a lifting of the degeneracy of the flat bands,\nconsistent with our observations.\nAs mentioned above, the global spin is given by the\nsublattice imbalance. This does not, however, determine\nthe local spin. For the hexagonally shaped hole structures we find not only a zero global spin, but also a\nzero spin on all atoms. This explains the identical band\ngaps found using DFT with and without spin. Such non-\n\n\f5\nmagnetic solutions have been found for finite graphene\nribbons or graphene flakes by Jiang et al.21 using DFT.\nThey find a sudden transition from non-magnetic to magnetic solutions going from a system size of [3,3] and [4,3]\nwith numbers indicating rings in the graphene lattice\nalong zig-zag and armchair directions. Such transitions\nare also seen in slits cut in graphene in a study by Kumazaki et al.20 Viewing each edge in our hexagonal structures as ribbons, the largest ribbon corresponds to a [4,3]\nribbon ({6, 3.6} structure). We thus expect local magnetization to appear for slightly larger systems.\nFor {6, 5}\u25b3 we have the strongest polarization at the\nmiddle of each edge with maximum magnetic moment per\natom being 0.24 \u03bcB . We note that each corner atom has a\nmagnetization -0.03 \u03bcB . The edge atom magnetization is\nbelow the maximum of 1/3 \u03bcB for graphene ribbons when\nthe width becomes too large for edge-edge interactions.\nOur systems thus have edge-edge interactions which is\nexpected due to the ribbon width of 6 rings. A plot\nof the spin-polarized density35 is shown in Fig. 5. The\nmajority spins reside mostly on the edges of the dominant\nsublattice sites. Neighboring sites on the other sublattice\nhave minority spin-polarization. Note also the non-zero\nspin of the atoms far from the edges indicating interaction\nbetween neighboring hole-edges.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nUsing DFT and DFTB we have calculated band gaps in\nvarious antidot lattice geometries. The computed band\ngaps range from 0.2 to 1.5 eV. In general, DFTB gives\nlarger band gaps than DFT with the largest difference\nfor non-magnetic structures of 44 %.

Combining the two methods\nby performing a DFT-calculation on a DFTB-relaxed\nstructure is found to give a good trade-off between accuracy and computational cost facilitating the treatment of\nlarger systems. However, even for unrelaxed geometries\nwe find qualitative agreement with the DFT-relaxed geometries. Trends for ideal geometries as presented here\ncan thus be investigated without any relaxation in the\nnon-magnetic case.\nCertain geometries are shown with DFT to have a\nnon-zero total magnetic moment which is understood via\nLieb's theorem as a consequence of sublattice imbalance.\nFor these structures a spin-polarized treatment is needed\nto achieve even qualitative results for the band gaps. Local spin, which can occur regardless of the total magnetic moment, is not observed for very edge-dominated\nsystems. Sublattice imbalance leads to the occurrence of\nlow-dispersion midgap bands. We find a lifting of degeneracy of these otherwise degenerate bands on a perfect\nbipartite lattice as well as a considerable spin-splitting.\nThese completely spin-polarized states are primarily located at the hole-edges.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Jesper G.
