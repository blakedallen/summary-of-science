We compare our predictions with\nmeasurements from a recent test beam study performed at Fermilab.\nKey words: Pixel; Silicon;\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nBTeV is an experiment designed to explore heavy flavor phenomenology thoroughly [1], with particular emphasis on mixing, CP violation and rare and\nforbidden decays. The pixel detector system is crucial to the experiment. We\nhave engaged in a thorough study of several different factors influencing the\nsensor performance, with particular emphasis on spatial resolution and detector occupancy. As the radiation dose is very intense at small distances from\nthe beam axis, our main emphasis is on n+ np+ sensors [2], where the collected\ncharge carriers are electrons.\nWe report the most important results on the expected performance of the\nBTeV baseline front end-sensor systems, as well as a comparison between our\npredictions and results recently obtained in a test beam run that took place\nat Fermilab, where we took extensive data using different prototype sensors\nand readout electronics [3].\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Preprint\n\n20 November 2018\n\n\f2\n\nSpatial resolution studies\n\nWe have investigated several factors affecting the spatial resolution, in particular charge diffusion, magnetic field, electronic noise, discriminator threshold\nand digitization resolution.\nWe have modeled the signal induced by minimum ionizing tracks traversing\nsilicon using a charge straggling distribution function supported by experimental data and a detailed theoretical model of the interactions responsible for\nthe energy loss in silicon [4]. The detector has been conceptually divided into\n\u223c 30 \u03bcm thick slices to model fluctuations in the energy deposition along the\ncharged particle track path. The most probable charge signal produced by a\nminimum ionizing particle in the 280 \u03bcm p-stop sensors used in the test beam\ndata is found to be 24000 e\u2212 with a full width at half maximum of 10000\ne\u2212 , in good agreement with the corresponding parameters of the measured\ndistribution [3].\nElectrons and holes produced by the energy deposited by a traversing charged\n~ in the detector. The equations\nparticle drift along the electric field lines (E)\ndescribing this drift motion are:\n~\nJ~e = \u2212q\u03c1e \u03bce E\n~\nJ~h = q\u03c1h \u03bch E\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nwhere q is the magnitude of the electron charge, \u03bce and \u03bch are the mobility\nof electrons and holes respectively, \u03c1e is the number of free electrons per unit\nvolume, and \u03c1h is number of free holes per unit volume.\nThe charge cloud spreads laterally due to diffusion. The parameters characterizing the drift in the electric field (\u03bch , \u03bce ) are related to the parameter\ndescribing the diffusion of the charge cloud (Dh ,De ) by the Einstein equation:\nDh(e) =\n\nkT\n\u03bch(e)\nq\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Dh and De are the diffusion coefficients and kT is the product of the\nBoltzmann constant and the absolute temperature of the silicon. The average square deviation with respect to the trajectory of the collected charge\nwithout diffusion is < \u2206r 2 >= 2D\u2206t. In our study we have used \u03bch =\n~\n400 cm2 /Vs, \u03bce = 1450 cm2 /Vs [5]. A magnetic field perpendicular to E\nproduces a distortion of the collected charge distribution parameterized in\nterms of the Hall mobility \u03bcH , proportional to the drift mobility. Finally, the\ncharge-cloud is collected on more pixels when the incident track crosses the\n2\n\n\fdetector at an angle, as the generation points of the electron-hole pairs spread\nout along the track path. These various effects are illustrated in Fig. 1 as a\nfunction of the incident angle \u03b8.\nThe discriminator threshold also influences the spatial resolution. In this study\nwe have assumed that only the pixels having a signal above threshold are read\nout, and we have varied the threshold for analog and binary readout. Fig. 2\n(top) shows the effect of increasing the threshold for an incident angle \u0398 = 300\nmr, for analog and digital readout respectively. The bottom plot shows the\nfraction of events having N pixels hit for a given threshold. For instance, for\na threshold of 1000 electrons, about 60% of the events have 3 pixels hit, and\nabout 40% have 2 pixels hit. The resolution achievable for binary readout\nshows a characteristic oscillatory behavior as we change the threshold. As the\ndigital clustering algorithm exploits the information provided by the number of\npixels in a cluster, its accuracy is best when there is an almost equal population\nin two different cluster sizes: the smaller cluster corresponding to a track\nincident in a pixel center and the bigger cluster corresponding to incidence\nclose to the boundary between two pixels. In the analog readout case, the\naccuracy of any position reconstruction algorithm is degraded as the threshold\nincreases.\nA pixel detector has the potential for being a very low noise system, since the\ncapacitive load at the input of the charge sensitive preamplifier is negligible.\nWe have achieved [6] 100 e\u2212 noise or below on the test bench. In order to\ntake full advantage of the low noise, the minimum threshold spread among\nchannels needs to be small. The measured spread in the devices used in the\ntest beam run is about 380 e\u2212 [3]. Prototypes of the more advanced version\nof this design show that a threshold spread of 180 e\u2212 or better is achievable.\nTherefore noise and threshold spread figures are not a limiting factor in the\ndetector performance.\nAn analog readout is a preferred solution for several reasons, including more\neffective monitoring of the stability of the detector properties and improvement in the spatial resolution. We need to know how many bits are required\nbecause the analogue circuit must fit within the small pixel cell boundary.\nFurthermore, we need to extract the digitized information very quickly. We\nhave thus investigated several different combinations of ADC transfer functions, varying both the dynamic range and the digitization accuracy. Fig. 3\nshows an example where the expected performance of our analog front end\nelectronics combined with a logarithmic 3 bit flash ADC is shown. As a comparison, the resolution expected from a 8 bit linear ADC is included. Note\nthat the difference is not too dramatic. This supports our conclusion that the\ndigitization resolution of 3 bits, chosen for our front end electronics, FPIX2,\nis optimal for our application.\n3\n\n\fIn order for this simulation tool to be effective, its accuracy must be checked\nwith experimental data. We have done a systematic study of the performance\nexpected from various sensor and readout electronics combinations used in the\nrecently completed test beam run. Details on the data taken and the analysis\nprocedure are given elsewhere in these proceedings [3]. The comparison between predicted and measured resolution is shown in Fig. 4 for two different\ndigitization accuracies (8 bit and 2 bit ADCs) as well as binary readout. The\ndata for the two ADCs tested were taken with different thresholds. Fig. 4 includes a simulation of the 2 bit ADC case with the lower threshold, showing\nthat the higher threshold used with the coarser ADC resolution is a dominant effect, in particular at small incidence angles. The agreement with the\ndata is very good, especially if we take into account that factors like imperfect\nalignment, track projection errors and angular resolution have not yet been\nincluded.\n\n3\n\nConclusions\n\nThe Monte Carlo simulation algorithm discussed in this paper has been a key\nelement in our optimization of the baseline design of the BTeV pixel detector\nsystem. The good agreement with recent test beam data gives us confidence\nthat the most important factors affecting the pixel performance are modeled\naccurately and that this baseline design will be an excellent tool to achieve\nour physics goals.\nWhile the results presented here are specific to the BTeV experiment, the\nalgorithm developed is quite general and can be applied to other detector\nsystems.\n\n4\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank D.
