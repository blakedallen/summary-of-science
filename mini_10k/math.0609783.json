CHRISTOPHER PHILLIPS\nAbstract. We prove that every simple higher dimensional noncommutative\ntorus is an AT algebra.\n\n0. Introduction\nA higher dimensional noncommutative torus is the universal C*-algebra generated by unitaries which commute up to specified scalars. Thus, it is a generalization\nof the rotation algebra A\u03b8 to more generators. The commutation relations are determined by a real skew symmetric matrix; see Notation 1.1 for a precise formulation.\nIn this paper, we prove that every simple higher dimensional noncommutative torus\nis an AT algebra, that is, a direct limit of finite direct sums of C*-algebras of the\nform C(S 1 , Mn ) for varying values of n.\nThe first result in this direction is the Elliott-Evans Theorem [10] for the ordinary\nirrational rotation algebras, which we use here as the initial step of an induction\nargument. Without giving a complete list of later work, we mention four highlights.\nAll simple three dimensional noncommutative tori were shown to be AT algebras\nby Q. Lin [25]. In arbitrary dimension, \"most\" simple higher dimensional noncommutative tori were shown to be AT algebras by Boca [4]. Kishimoto (Corollary 6.6\nof [18]) obtained this result in all cases in which, in the skew symmetric matrix\ngiving the commutation relations, the entries above the diagonal are rationally independent, as well as some others. Theorem 3.14 of [22] shows that the crossed\nproduct of (S 1 )d by a minimal rotation is an AT algebra; in this case, most of the\nentries of the relevant skew symmetric matrix are zero.\nOur proof is by induction on the number of generators. Every higher dimensional\nnoncommutative torus can be written as an iterated crossed product by Z, and the\nproof of Kishimoto's result uses an inductive argument which works whenever the\nintermediate crossed products are all simple. One has some choice here: different\nchoices of the commutation relations may well give the same C*-algebra. As a very\nsimple example, one might simply write the generators in a different order. Unfortunately, it seems not to be possible in general to choose commutation relations\nto give the same algebra, or even a Morita equivalent algebra (see [35]), and in\nsuch a way that Kishimoto's method applies, or even in such a way as to get a\ntensor product of algebras to which this method applies. However, if one allows\none more kind of modification, namely the replacements of unitary generators by\nDate: 17 Sept. 2006.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

CHRISTOPHER PHILLIPS\n\ninteger powers of themselves, then it is always possible to replace a noncommutative torus by a tensor product of algebras covered by Kishimoto's method. The\nnew algebra isn't isomorphic, or even Morita equivalent, to the original. But if\none replaces only one generator, the new algebra is the fixed point algebra of a\ntracially approximately inner action [28] of a finite cyclic group which has the tracial Rokhlin property [28]. As proved in [28], this operation thus preserves tracial\nrank zero. Because K0 and K1 are torsion free, H. Lin's classification theorem for\nsimple nuclear C*-algebras with tracial rank zero, Theorem 5.2 of [23], shows that\nthis operation preserves the property of being an AT algebra. Indeed, the tracial\nRokhlin property was introduced specifically for this purpose. It is not possible to\nsubstitute the Rokhlin property of [15] and [16] in this argument. As we show in\nCorollary 3.15, the relevant action does not have the Rokhlin property.\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section 1 contains various preliminaries.\nThere is little that is really new, but our presentation gives the material in a convenient form and establishes notation for the rest of the paper. In Section 2, we\nprove that if A is a simple higher dimensional noncommutative torus, then the automorphism which multiplies one of the standard unitary generators by exp(2\u03c0i/n)\ngenerates an action of Zn with the tracial Rokhlin property. In Section 3, we use\nthis result, Kishimoto's result, and H. Lin's classification theorem [23], to construct\nan inductive proof that every simple noncommutative torus is an AT algebra, and\nwe obtain several corollaries.\nThis paper contains the material of Sections 5 through 7 of the unpublished long\npreprint [27].\nWe use the notation Zn for Z/nZ; the p-adic integers will not appear in this\npaper. If A is a C*-algebra and \u03b1 : A \u2192 A is an automorphism such that \u03b1n =\nidA , then we write C \u2217 (Zn , A, \u03b1) for the crossed product of A by the action of Zn\ngenerated by \u03b1. We write p - q to mean that the projection p is Murray-von\nNeumann equivalent to a subprojection of q, and p \u223c q to mean that p is Murrayvon Neumann equivalent to q. Also, [a, b] denotes the additive commutator ab \u2212 ba.\nI am grateful to Marc Rieffel for discussions concerning higher dimensional noncommutative tori, and in particular for pointing out that it was not known whether\na higher dimensional noncommutative torus is isomorphic to its opposite algebra.\nSee Corollary 3.14; this remains open in the nonsimple case. I would like to thank\nHiroyuki Osaka for carefully reading earlier versions of this paper, and catching a\nnumber of misprints and suggesting many improvements, and Hanfeng Li for useful\ncomments, including the improvement of Lemma 2.11.\n1. Higher dimensional noncommutative tori\nIn this section we present, in a form convenient for our purposes, some mostly\nstandard facts about higher dimensional noncommutative tori and about irrational\nrotation algebras.\nNotation 1.1. Let \u03b8 be a skew symmetric real d \u00d7 d matrix. The noncommutative torus A\u03b8 is by definition [34] the universal C*-algebra generated by unitaries\nu1 , u2 , . . . , ud subject to the relations\nuk uj = exp(2\u03c0i\u03b8j,k )uj uk\nfor 1 \u2264 j, k \u2264 d. (Of course, if all \u03b8j,k are integers, it is not really noncommutative.)\nSome authors use \u03b8k,j in the commutation relation instead. See for example [17].\n\n\fSIMPLE HIGHER DIMENSIONAL NONCOMMUTATIVE TORUS\n\n3\n\nRemark 1.2. We note (see the beginning of Section 4 of [32] and the introduction\nto [35]) that A\u03b8 is the universal C*-algebra generated by unitaries ux , for x \u2208 Zd ,\nsubject to the relations\nuy ux = exp(\u03c0ihx, \u03b8(y)i)ux+y\nfor x, y \u2208 Zd .\nIt follows that if B \u2208 GLd (Z), and if B t denotes the transpose of B, then\nAB t \u03b8B \u223c\n= A\u03b8 . That is, A\u03b8 is unchanged if \u03b8 is rewritten in terms of some other basis\nof Zd .\nRemark 1.3. Let \u03b1 be a skew symmetric real bicharacter on Zd , that is, a Zbilinear function \u03b1 : Zd \u00d7 Zd \u2192 R such that \u03b1(x, y) = \u2212\u03b1(y, x) for all x, y \u2208 Zd .\nFor any basis (b1 , b2 , . . . , bd ) of Zd , there is a unique skew symmetric real d \u00d7 d\nmatrix \u03b8 such that\n\u0013 X\n\u0012X\nXd\nd\nd\nxj \u03b8j,k yk\n\u03b1\nyk bk =\nxk bk ,\nk=1\n\nk=1\n\nj,k=1\n\nfor all x, y \u2208 Zd . We define A\u03b1 = A\u03b8 . Remark 1.2 shows that this C*-algebra is\nindependent of the choice of basis.\nRemark 1.4. Let \u03b1 be a skew symmetric real bicharacter on Zd , and let H \u2282 Zd\nbe a subgroup. Then H \u223c\n= Zm for some m \u2264 d. By abuse of notation, we write \u03b1|H\nfor the restriction of \u03b1 to H \u00d7 H \u2282 Zd \u00d7 Zd . There is a noncommutative torus A\u03b1|H\nby Remark 1.3, which does not depend on the choice of the isomorphism H \u223c\n= Zm .\nFor a skew symmetric real d\u00d7d matrix \u03b8 and a subgroup H \u2282 Zd with a specified\nordered basis, we write \u03b8|H for the matrix in that basis of the restriction to H of the\nreal bicharacter (x, y) 7\u2192 hx, \u03b8yi. For subgroups such as Zm \u00d7 {0} or Zm \u00d7 {0} \u00d7 Zl ,\nwe use without comment the obvious basis.\nWe formalize a remark made in 1.7 of [8], according to which every noncommutative torus can be obtained as a repeated crossed product by Z.\nLemma 1.5. Let \u03b1 be a skew symmetric real bicharacter on Zd . Then there is an\nautomorphism \u03c6 of A\u03b1|Zd\u22121 \u00d7{0} which is homotopic to the identity and such that\nA\u03b1 \u223c\n= C \u2217 (Z, A\u03b1|Zd\u22121 \u00d7{0} , \u03c6).\nProof. Let \u03b8 be the matrix of \u03b1 in the standard basis. Let \u03b2 = \u03b1|Zd\u22121 \u00d7{0} . Then the\nmatrix of \u03b2 is (\u03b8j,k )1\u2264j,k\u2264d\u22121 . Let u1 , u2 , . . . , ud\u22121 be the standard generators of\nA\u03b2 . Then \u03c6 is determined by \u03c6(uj ) = exp(2\u03c0i\u03b1j,d )uj . It is clear that \u03c6 is homotopic\nto the identity.\nThe following definition is essentially from Section 1.1 of [37].\nDefinition 1.6. The skew symmetric real d \u00d7 d matrix \u03b8 is nondegenerate if whenever x \u2208 Zd satisfies exp(2\u03c0ihx, \u03b8yi) = 1 for all y \u2208 Zd , then x = 0. Otherwise,\n\u03b8 is degenerate. We similarly refer to degeneracy and nondegeneracy of a skew\nsymmetric real bicharacter on Zd .\nLemma 1.7. Let \u03b8 be a skew symmetric real d \u00d7 d matrix. Then \u03b8 is degenerate\nif and only if there exists x \u2208 Qd \\ {0} such that hx, \u03b8yi \u2208 Q for all y \u2208 Qd .\n\n\f4\n\nN. CHRISTOPHER PHILLIPS\n\nProof. If \u03b8 is degenerate, choose w 6= 0 such that exp(2\u03c0ihw, \u03b8yi) = 1 for all\ny \u2208 Zd . Then hw, \u03b8yi \u2208 Z for all y \u2208 Zd . If now y \u2208 Qd is arbitrary, then there\nexists m \u2208 Z \\ {0} such that my \u2208 Zd . So\nhw, \u03b8yi =\n\n1\nm hw, \u03b8(my)i\n\n\u2208\n\n1\nmZ\n\n\u2282 Q.\n\nd\n\nConversely, assume x \u2208 Q \\ {0} and hx, \u03b8yi \u2208 Q for all y \u2208 Qd . Choose\nm \u2208 Z with m > 0 such that mhx, \u03b8\u03b4k i \u2208 Z for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 d. Then mx 6= 0\nand exp(2\u03c0ihmx, \u03b8yi) = 1 for all y \u2208 Zd .\nLemma 1.8. Let \u03b8 be a skew symmetric real d \u00d7 d matrix. Let B \u2208 GLd (Q). Then\nB t \u03b8B is nondegenerate if and only if \u03b8 is nondegenerate.\nProof. It suffices to prove one direction. Suppose \u03b8 is degenerate. By Lemma 1.7,\nthere is x \u2208 Qd \\ {0} such that hx, \u03b8yi \u2208 Q for all y \u2208 Qd . Then B \u22121 x \u2208 Qd \\ {0}\nand\nhB \u22121 x, B t \u03b8Byi = hx, \u03b8Byi \u2208 Q\nfor all y \u2208 Qd . So B t \u03b8B is degenerate.\nThe following result is well known.\nTheorem 1.9. The C*-algebra A\u03b8 of Notation 1.1 is simple if and only if \u03b8 is\nnondegenerate. Moreover, if A\u03b8 is simple it has a unique tracial state.\nProof. If \u03b8 is nondegenerate, then A\u03b8 is simple by Theorem 3.7 of [37]. (Note the\nstanding assumption of nondegeneracy throughout Section 3 of [37].)\nWhen A\u03b8 is simple, the proof of Lemma 3.1 of [37] shows that A\u03b8 can have at\nmost one tracial state. Existence of a tracial state is well known, or can be obtained\nfrom Lemma 1.5 by induction on n.\nIf \u03b8 is degenerate, then we follow 1.8 of [8]. Choose n \u2208 Zd \\ {0} such that\nexp(2\u03c0ihn, \u03b8yi) = 1 for all y \u2208 Zd . Then v = un1 1 un2 2 * * * und d is a nontrivial element\nof the center of A\u03b8 , which is therefore not simple.\nFinally, for reference and to establish notation, we recall several facts about the\nordinary rotation algebras (the case d = 2). (As far as we know, the last lemma has\nnot appeared before, but its proof is easy.) We will consider various embeddings of\nrotation algebras into higher dimensional noncommutative tori. Therefore, for \u03b7 \u2208\nR we let v\u03b7 and w\u03b7 denote the standard unitary generators of A\u03b7 , satisfying w\u03b7 v\u03b7 =\nexp(2\u03c0i\u03b7)v\u03b7 w\u03b7 . In this way, we avoid confusion with the generators u1 , u2 , . . . , ud\nof a higher dimensional noncommutative torus A\u03b8 .\nThe proof of the next theorem is contained in Theorem 1.1 and Proposition 1.3\nof [1]. Also see Corollary 3.6 and Definition 3.3 of [33]. We refer to [5] for information on continuous fields of C*-algebras. See especially Sections 10.1 and 10.3.\nTheorem 1.10. For \u03b7 \u2208 R let A\u03b7 be the rotation algebra, with generators as\ndescribed above. Let A be the C*-algebra of the discrete Heisenberg group, which\nis the universal C*-algebra generated by unitaries v, w, z subject to the relations\nwv = zvw,\n\nzv = vz,\n\nand zw = wz.\n\nThen there is a continuous field of C*-algebras over S 1 whose fiber over exp(2\u03c0i\u03b7)\nis A\u03b7 , whose C*-algebra of continuous sections is A, and such that the evaluation\nmap ev\u03b7 : A \u2192 A\u03b7 of sections at exp(2\u03c0i\u03b7) is determined by\nev\u03b7 (v) = v\u03b7 ,\n\nev\u03b7 (w) = w\u03b7 ,\n\nand ev\u03b7 (z) = exp(2\u03c0i\u03b7) * 1.\n\n\fSIMPLE HIGHER DIMENSIONAL NONCOMMUTATIVE TORUS\n\n5\n\nSince we will only formally deal with one continuous field in this paper, the\nfollowing notation is unambiguous.\nNotation 1.11. For a subset E \u2282 S 1 , we let \u0393(E) be the set of continuous sections\nof the continuous field of Theorem 1.10 over E. (See 10.1.6 of [5].)\nFor any such section a, we further write a(\u03b7) for a(exp(2\u03c0i\u03b7)). No confusion\nshould arise.\nLemma 1.12. Let the notation be as in Theorem 1.10 and Notation 1.11. Let\n\u03c4\u03b7 be the standard trace on A\u03b7 , satisfying \u03c4 (1) = 1 and \u03c4\u03b7 (v\u03b7m w\u03b7n ) = 0 unless\nm = n = 0. (If A\u03b7 is viewed as a crossed product by rotation on the circle, then \u03c4\u03b7\ncomes from normalized Haar measure on the circle.) Let U \u2282 S 1 be an open set,\nand let a \u2208 \u0393(U ). Then \u03b7 7\u2192 \u03c4\u03b7 (a(\u03b7)) is continuous.\nProof. We check continuity at \u03b70 . Choose a continuous function h : S 1 \u2192 [0, 1] such\nthat supp(h) \u2282 U and such that h = 1 on a neighborhood of \u03b70 . Then it suffices to\nconsider the continuous section ha in place of a. Now ha is the restriction to U of a\ncontinuous section b defined on all of S 1 , satisfying b(\u03b6) = 0 for \u03b6 6\u2208 U. Accordingly,\nwe may restrict to the case U = S 1 . Then a \u2208 A.\nFrom the formulas\nev\u03b7 (v) = v\u03b7 ,\n\nev\u03b7 (w) = w\u03b7 ,\n\nand ev\u03b7 (z) = exp(2\u03c0i\u03b7) * 1\n\nand the definition of \u03c4\u03b7 , it is immediate that if b is any (noncommutative) monomial\nin v, w, z, and their adjoints, then \u03b7 7\u2192 \u03c4\u03b7 (b(\u03b7)) is continuous. Therefore the\nsame holds for any noncommutative polynomial, and hence for any norm limit of\nnoncommutative polynomials, including a.\nLemma 1.13. Let the notation be as in Theorem 1.10 and Lemma 1.12. Let\n\u03b7 \u2208 R \\ Q. Let n \u2208 N, let \u03c9 = exp(2\u03c0i/n), and let \u03b1 : A\u03b7 \u2192 A\u03b7 be the unique\nautomorphism satisfying \u03b1(v\u03b7 ) = \u03c9v\u03b7 and \u03b1(w\u03b7 ) = w\u03b7 . Then for every \u03b5 > 0 there\nexist mutually orthogonal projections e0 , e1 , . . . , en\u22121 such that (with en = e0 ) we\nhave \u03b1(ej ) = ej+1 for 0 \u2264 j \u2264 n \u2212 1, and such that 1 \u2212 n\u03c4\u03b7 (e0 ) < \u03b5.\n1\nProof. Set \u03b50 = 4n\n\u03b5. Let f : S 1 \u2192 [0, 1] be a continuous function such that supp(f )\nis contained in the open arc from 1 to\u0002\u03c9, and\u0003\u0001such that f (\u03b6) = 1 for all \u03b6 in the\nclosed arc from exp(2\u03c0i\u03b50 ) to exp 2\u03c0i n1 \u2212 \u03b50 . Then f (v\u03b7 ) is a positive element\nof A\u03b7 with kf (v\u03b7 )k \u2264 1 and \u03c4\u03b7 (f (v\u03b7 )) \u2265 n1 \u2212 2\u03b50 . Since A\u03b7 has real rank zero (see\nRemark 6 of [10], or Theorem 1.5 of [3]), there is a projection e0 in the hereditary\nsubalgebra B of A\u03b7 generated by f (v\u03b7 ) such that ke0 f (v\u03b7 ) \u2212 f (v\u03b7 )k < \u03b50 . Therefore\nke0 f (v\u03b7 )e0 \u2212 f (v\u03b7 )k < 2\u03b50 . Since e0 f (v\u03b7 )e0 \u2264 e0 , it follows that\n\n\u03c4\u03b7 (e0 ) \u2265 \u03c4\u03b7 (e0 f (v\u03b7 )e0 ) > \u03c4\u03b7 (f (v\u03b7 )) \u2212 2\u03b50 \u2265\n\n1\nn\n\n\u2212 4\u03b50 .\n\nWe have \u03b1k (f (v\u03b7 ))\u03b1l (f (v\u03b7 )) = 0 for 0 \u2264 k, l \u2264 n \u2212 1 and k 6= l. Therefore\n\u03b1 (B)\u03b1l (B) = {0} for such k and l, whence also \u03b1k (e0 )\u03b1l (e0 ) = 0. Define ek =\n\u03b1k (e0 ) for 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2212 1.

The tracial Rokhlin property and higher dimensional\nnoncommutative tori\nIn this section, we prove that if \u03b8 is nondegenerate, then the action of Zn which\nmultiplies one of the standard generators of A\u03b8 by a primitive n-th root of 1 has\nthe tracial Rokhlin property. We note for comparison the related result in Section 6\nof [17]: if \u03b1 \u2208 Aut(A\u03b8 ) is of the form \u03b1(uj ) = \u03bbj uj , with \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , . . . , \u03bbn \u2208 S 1 , and if\nall positive powers of \u03b1 are outer, then \u03b1 has the Rokhlin property. However, our\naction of Zn does not have the Rokhlin property. See Corollary 3.15 below.\nOne might hope to prove the tracial Rokhlin property fairly directly, using one\nof the criteria in Section 5 of [6] or Section 1 of [29]. This approach does not work,\nbecause these criteria all assume that the C*-algebra involved is already known\nto have tracial rank zero, while our argument requires knowing that the action\non a particular higher dimensional noncommutative torus has the tracial Rokhlin\nproperty before we know that it has tracial rank zero. Instead, as is done in the\nproof in [2] that A\u03b8 has real rank zero, and analogously to Section 6 of [17], we will\nreduce to a construction in the ordinary irrational rotation algebras. The idea is to\nfind an approximately central copy of an ordinary irrational rotation algebra A\u03b7 ,\nsuch that the restriction to it of our action is the one in Lemma 1.13. Since the\nprojections in A\u03b7 must be chosen ahead of time, at least approximately, we must\nrequire that \u03b7 be arbitrarily close to some fixed \u03b70 . Nondegeneracy enters through\nLemma 2.4 below. To obtain the correct restricted action, we use the condition (3)\nin Lemma 2.8 below. From then on, we roughly follow the argument used in [3] to\nprove approximate divisibility. We vary the arrangement slightly to make part of\nthe argument easily available for use elsewhere.\nWe recall the tracial Rokhlin property for actions of finite cyclic groups on infinite\ndimensional finite simple unital C*-algebras. The following result is Lemma 1.16\nof [28], for the case that the group is cyclic.\nProposition 2.1. Let A be an infinite dimensional finite simple unital C*-algebra,\nand let \u03b1 \u2208 Aut(A) satisfy \u03b1n = idA . The action of Zn generated by \u03b1 has the\ntracial Rokhlin property if and only if for every finite set F \u2282 A, every \u03b5 > 0, and\nevery nonzero positive element x \u2208 A, there are mutually orthogonal projections\ne0 , e1 , . . . , en\u22121 \u2208 A such that:\n(1) k\u03b1(ej ) \u2212 ej+1 k < \u03b5 for 0 \u2264 j \u2264 n \u2212 1, where by convention we take the\nindices mod n, that is, en = e0 .\n(2) kej a \u2212 aej k < \u03b5 for 0 \u2264 j \u2264 n \u2212 1 and all a \u2208 F.\nPn\u22121\n(3) With e = j=0 ej , the projection 1 \u2212 e is Murray-von Neumann equivalent\nto a projection in the hereditary subalgebra of A generated by x.\nDefinition 2.2. Let \u03b8 be a skew symmetric real d \u00d7 d matrix. Let\nn = (n1 , n2 , . . . , nd ) \u2208 Zd\n\nand v = un1 1 un2 2 * * * und d \u2208 A\u03b8 .\n\nWe write \u03b3n for the inner automorphism Ad(v) of the noncommutative torus\nA\u03b8 . We further define a homomorphism \u03c3 : Zd \u2192 (S 1 )d by the formula \u03c3(n)j =\nexp(2\u03c0i(\u03b8n)j ) for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 d. (Here the expression \u03b8n is the usual action of a d \u00d7 d\nmatrix on an element of Rd .)\nLemma 2.3. Let \u03b8 be a skew symmetric real d \u00d7 d matrix. With \u03b3 and \u03c3 as in\nDefinition 2.2, we have \u03b3n (uj ) = \u03c3(n)j uj for n \u2208 Zd and 1 \u2264 j \u2264 d. Moreover, if\n\n\fSIMPLE HIGHER DIMENSIONAL NONCOMMUTATIVE TORUS\n\n7\n\nm \u2208 Zd , then\nmd\nmd\nm1 m2\n1 m2\n\u03b3n (um\n1 u2 * * * ud ) = exp(2\u03c0ihm, \u03b8ni)u1 u2 * * * ud\n\nfor all n \u2208 Zd .\nProof. The first formula is the special case of the second obtained by setting m = \u03b4j ,\nthe j-th standard basis vector of Zd . By linearity, both formulas will follow if we\ncheck the first when m = \u03b4j and n = \u03b4k . Since (\u03b8\u03b4k )j = \u03b8j,k , this is just the\ncommutation relation\nuk uj u\u2217k = exp(2\u03c0i\u03b8j,k )uj ,\nwhich is the same as the one in from Notation 1.1.\nLemma 2.4. Let \u03b8 be a skew symmetric real d \u00d7 d matrix. The homomorphism\n\u03c3 : Zd \u2192 (S 1 )d of Definition 2.2 has dense range if and only if \u03b8 is nondegenerate.\nProof. Assume \u03c3 does not have dense range. Let H = \u03c3(Zd ), which is a proper\nclosed subgroup of (S 1 )d . Choose a nontrivial character \u03bc : (S 1 )d \u2192 S 1 whose kernel\ncontains H. By the identification of the dual group of (S 1 )d , there is r \u2208 Zd \\ {0}\nsuch that\n\u03bc(\u03b61 , \u03b62 , . . . , \u03b6d ) = \u03b61r1 \u03b62r2 * * * \u03b6drd\nfor all \u03b6 \u2208 (S 1 )d . Because H \u2282 Ker(\u03bc), for all n \u2208 Zd we have\n1 = \u03bc(\u03c3(n)) = exp(2\u03c0i(\u03b8n)1 )r1 exp(2\u03c0i(\u03b8n)2 )r2 * * * exp(2\u03c0i(\u03b8n)d )rd\n= exp(2\u03c0ihr, \u03b8ni).\nThus \u03b8 is degenerate.\nNow suppose that \u03b8 is degenerate. Then we may choose r \u2208 Zd \\ {0} such that\nexp(2\u03c0ihr, \u03b8ni) = 1 for all n \u2208 Zd . Reversing the above calculation, we find that\nthe nontrivial character\n\u03bc(\u03b61 , \u03b62 , . . . , \u03b6d ) = \u03b61r1 \u03b62r2 * * * \u03b6drd\nsatisfies \u03bc(\u03c3(n)) = 1 for all n \u2208 Zd . Therefore \u03c3 does not have dense range.\nCorollary 2.5. Let \u03b8 be a nondegenerate skew symmetric real d \u00d7 d matrix. Let\nG \u2282 Zd be a subgroup with finite index. Let \u03c3 : Zd \u2192 (S 1 )d be the homomorphism\nof Definition 2.2. Then \u03c3(G) is dense in (S 1 )d .\nProof. Let H = \u03c3(G). Let S be a set of coset representatives for G in Zd . Then\nthe sets \u03c3(m)H, for m \u2208 S, are closed and are pairwise equal or disjoint. By\nLemma 2.4, their union is (S 1 )d . Since there are finitely many of them, and since\n(S 1 )d is connected, it follows that all are equal to (S 1 )d .\nCorollary 2.6. Let \u03b8 be a nondegenerate skew symmetric real d \u00d7 d matrix. Let\n\u03b61 , \u03b62 , . . . , \u03b6d \u2208 S 1 . Let \u03b1 \u2208 A\u03b8 be the automorphism determined by \u03b1(uj ) = \u03b6j uj\nfor 1 \u2264 j \u2264 d. Then \u03b1 is approximately inner.\nProof. It suffices to find, for all \u03b5 > 0, a unitary v \u2208 A\u03b8 such that k\u03b1(uj )\u2212vuj v \u2217 k <\n\u03b5 for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 d.

Let G = nZ \u2295 Zd\u22121 , which is a finite\nindex subgroup of Zd . According to Corollary 2.5, the subgroup \u03c3(G) is dense in\n(S 1 )d . Let\nF = {l \u2208 Zd : |lj | \u2264 N + 1 for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 d}.\nSince F is finite, \u03c3(G \\ F ) is also dense in (S 1 )d .

Also, A\u03b8 has Property (SP) by Theorem 1.4(b) of [3].\nIf now a nonzero positive element x \u2208 A\u03b8 is given, then we may use Property (SP)\nto find a nonzero projection p \u2208 xAx.

Then one checks, by\nexamining the generators u\nek , that \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03b2\u03b61 ,\u03b62 ,...,\u03b6d = \u03b3\u03b61 ,\u03b62 ,...,\u03b6d \u25e6 \u03c6 for \u03b61 , \u03b62 , . . . , \u03b6d \u2208\nS 1 . Injectivity of \u03c6|A\u03b3e now implies injectivity of \u03c6, since if a is a nonzero positive\ne\n\u03b8\n\nelement of Ker(\u03c6), then averaging over (S 1 )d gives a nonzero positive element of\nKer(\u03c6) \u2229 Ae\u03b3e .\n\u03b8\n\nCorollary 2.12. Let \u03b8 be a nondegenerate skew symmetric real d \u00d7 d matrix. Let\nn \u2208 N, let 1 \u2264 l \u2264 d, and let\nB = diag(1, . . . , 1, n, 1, . . . , 1) \u2208 GLd (Q),\nwhere n is in the l-th position. Then AB t \u03b8B has tracial rank zero if and only if A\u03b8\nhas tracial rank zero.\nProof.

We claim that A\u03b1\nD \u2282 A\u03b1 is clear. For\n\u03b8 = D. That\nPn\u22121 j \u03b8\n1\n\u03b1\nthe reverse inclusion, define E : A\u03b8 \u2192 A\u03b8 by E(a) = n j=0 \u03b1 (a). Then E is a\nmd \u0001\n1 m2\nsurjective continuous linear map, so it suffices to show that E um\n\u2208D\n1 u2 * * * ud\nmd\n1 m2\nfor all m = (m1 , m2 , . . . , md ) \u2208 Zd .

Direct limit decomposition for simple noncommutative tori\nIn this section, we use the results of the previous two sections to prove that every\nsimple higher dimensional noncommutative torus is an AT algebra.\nThe following result is essentially Corollary 6.6 of [18].\nProposition 3.1. Let \u03b1 be a nondegenerate skew symmetric real bicharacter on\nZn . Suppose that A\u03b1|Zn\u22121 \u00d7{0} is a simple AT algebra with real rank zero. Then A\u03b1\nis a simple AT algebra with real rank zero.\nn\u22121\nProof. Let \u03b2 = \u03b1|Zn\u22121 \u00d7{0} . We note that K0 (A\u03b2 ) \u223c\nby Lemma 1.5\n= K1 (A\u03b2 ) \u223c\n= Z2\nand by repeated application of the Pimsner-Voiculescu exact sequence [31]. In\nparticular, both groups are finitely generated. Further write A\u03b1 = C \u2217 (Z, A\u03b2 , \u03c6)\nas in Lemma 1.5, with \u03c6 homotopic to the identity. Thus, in the notation of [18]\n(see the introduction to [18]), \u03c6 \u2208 HInn(A\u03b2 ). So the proof of Corollary 6.5 of [18]\nshows that the hypotheses of Theorem 6.4 of [18] hold. We know from Lemma 1.9\nthat A\u03b1 = C \u2217 (Z, A\u03b2 , \u03c6) has a unique tracial state. Therefore Theorem 6.4 of [18]\nimplies that A\u03b1 = C \u2217 (Z, A\u03b2 , \u03c6) is a simple AT algebra with real rank zero.\n\nIt is worth pointing out another version of the proof. The automorphism \u03c6 has\nthe Rokhlin property by Theorem 6.1 of [17] and the preceding remark in [17].\nThe algebra A\u03b2 has tracial rank zero, since it is a simple unital AT algebra with\nreal rank zero. Therefore \u03c6 has the tracial Rokhlin property for actions of Z, by\nTheorem 1.12 of [26]. It is approximately inner by Corollary 2.6. So Theorem 3.9\nof [24] applies, showing that A\u03b1 has tracial rank zero. Now one can conclude that\nA\u03b1 is an AT algebra by the same proof as for Theorem 3.8. However, tracial rank\nzero is all that is really needed here.\nLemma 3.2. The group GLd (Q) is generated as a group by GLd (Z) and all matrices\nof the form diag(1, . . . , 1, n, 1, . . . , 1), where n \u2208 N is nonzero and is in an arbitrary\nposition.\nProof. Let G be the subgroup of GLd (Q) generated by GLd (Z) and the matrices\ndiag(1, . . . , 1, n, 1, . . . , 1). It suffices to show that G contains all of the following\nthree kinds of elementary matrices:\n(1)\n\nEj (r) = diag(1, . . . , 1, r, 1, . . . , 1),\n\n\fSIMPLE HIGHER DIMENSIONAL NONCOMMUTATIVE TORUS\n\n15\n\nwhere r \u2208 Q \\ {0} and is the j-th diagonal entry in the matrix; the transposition\n(2)\nmatrix Ej,k , for 1 \u2264 j < k \u2264 d, which acts on the standard basis vectors by\n\uf8f1\nl 6= j, k\n\uf8f2 \u03b4l\n(2)\n\u03b4k\nl=j\nEj,k (\u03b4l ) =\n\uf8f3\n\u03b4j\nl = k;\n(3)\n\nand the matrix Ej,k (r) for 1 \u2264 j, k \u2264 n with j 6= k and r \u2208 Q, given by\n\u001a\n\u03b4l\nl=\n6 k\n(3)\nEj,k (r)(\u03b4l ) =\n\u03b4k + r\u03b4j\nl = k.\n\nIf r = (\u22121)m p/q with m = 0 or m = 1 and with p and q positive integers, then\n\u0002 (1) \u0003\u22121\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\nEj (r) = Ej ((\u22121)m )Ej (p) Ej (q) ,\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the first factor is in GLd (Z) and Ej (p) and Ej (q) are among the other gen(2)\n\n(3)\n\nerators of G. The matrix Ej,k is already in GLd (Z). For Ej,k (r), we may conjugate\nby a permutation matrix, which is in GLd (Z), and split off as a direct summand\na (d \u2212 2) \u00d7 (d \u2212 2) identity matrix, and thus reduce to the case d = 2, j = 1, and\nk = 2. Write r = p/q with p \u2208 Z and q \u2208 N. Then the factorization\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u22121 \u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n1 p/q\nq 0\n1 p\nq 0\n(3)\nE1,2 (r) =\n=\n0 1\n0 1\n0 1\n0 1\n(3)\n\nshows that E1,2 (r) \u2208 G.\nCorollary 3.3. Let \u03b8 be a nondegenerate skew symmetric real d \u00d7 d matrix. Let\nB \u2208 GLd (Q). Then AB t \u03b8B has tracial rank zero if and only if A\u03b8 has tracial rank\nzero.\nProof. Combine Lemma 3.2, Remark 1.2, and Corollary 2.12.\nLemma 3.4. Let \u03b8 be a nondegenerate skew symmetric real d \u00d7 d matrix, with\nd > 2. Suppose that there is no subgroup H of Zd of rank d \u2212 1 such that \u03b8|H (in\nthe sense of Remark 1.4) is nondegenerate. Let r < d \u2212 1 be the maximal rank\nof a proper subgroup H of Zd such that \u03b8|H is nondegenerate. Then there exists\nB \u2208 GLd (Q) such that B t \u03b8B has the block form\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c11,1\n\u03c11,2\nt\n,\nB \u03b8B =\n(\u03c11,2 )t \u03c12,2\nwith \u03c11,1 and \u03c12,2 nondegenerate skew symmetric real r \u00d7 r and (d \u2212 r) \u00d7 (d \u2212 r)\nmatrices, and where all the entries of \u03c11,2 are in Z.\nProof. Let H \u2282 Zd be a subgroup of rank r such that \u03b8|H is nondegenerate. Since\n\u03b8 is not rational, clearly r \u2265 2. Let (v1 , v2 , . . . , vr ) be a basis for H over Z. Choose\nvr+1 , . . . , vd \u2208 Zd such that (v1 , v2 , . . . , vd ) is a basis for Qd over Q. For r + 1 \u2264\nk \u2264 d, by hypothesis \u03b8|H+Zvk is degenerate. By Lemma 1.7, there exists xk \u2208\nspanQ (H \u222a {vk }) \\ {0} such that hxk , \u03b8yi \u2208 Q for all y \u2208 spanQ (H \u222a {vk }). Since\n\u03b8|H is nondegenerate, we have xk 6\u2208 spanQ (H). Therefore vk \u2208 spanQ (H \u222a {xk }). It\nfollows that\nvr+1 , . . . , vd \u2208 spanQ (v1 , v2 , . . . , vr , xr+1 , . . . , xd ),\n\n\f16\n\nN. CHRISTOPHER PHILLIPS\n\nso that (v1 , v2 , . . . , vr , xr+1 , . . . , xd ) is a basis for Qd . By construction, we have\nhxk , \u03b8vl i \u2208 Q for 1 \u2264 l \u2264 r and r + 1 \u2264 k \u2264 d. Choose N \u2208 Z \\ {0} such that\nN hxk , \u03b8vl i \u2208 Z for 1 \u2264 l \u2264 r and r + 1 \u2264 k \u2264 d.\nLet B \u2208 GLd (Q) be the matrix whose action on the standard basis vectors is\n\u001a\nvk\n1\u2264k\u2264r\nB\u03b4k =\nN xk\nr + 1 \u2264 k \u2264 d.\nThen for 1 \u2264 l \u2264 r and r + 1 \u2264 k \u2264 d, we have\nh\u03b4k , B t \u03b8B\u03b4l i = N hxk , \u03b8vl i \u2208 Z.\nSince B t \u03b8B is skew symmetric, this shows that it has a block decomposition of the\nrequired form. It is immediate to check that the two diagonal blocks must be nondegenerate, since otherwise B t \u03b8B would be degenerate, contradicting Lemma 1.8.\nTheorem 3.5. Let \u03b8 be a nondegenerate skew symmetric real d \u00d7 d matrix, with\nd \u2265 2. Then A\u03b8 has tracial rank zero.\nProof. We prove this by induction on d. For d = 2, the Elliott-Evans Theorem [10]\nshows that A\u03b8 is a simple AT algebra with real rank zero, and tracial rank zero\nthen follows from Proposition 2.6 of [19] (with C as defined in 2.5 of [19]). Suppose\nd is given, and the theorem is known for all skew symmetric real k \u00d7 k matrices\nwith k < d. Let \u03b8 be a nondegenerate skew symmetric real d \u00d7 d matrix. There are\ntwo cases.\nFirst, suppose that there is a subgroup H0 of Zd of rank d \u2212 1 such that \u03b8|H0 (in\nthe sense of Remark 1.4) is nondegenerate. Set\nH = {x \u2208 Zd : There is n \u2208 Z such that nx \u2208 H0 }.\nThen H is also a subgroup of Zd of rank d \u2212 1, and \u03b8|H0 is also nondegenerate.\nMoreover, Zd /H is torsion free and therefore isomorphic to Z, from which it follows\nthat the quotient map splits. Thus there is an isomorphism Zd \u2192 Zd which sends\nH isomorphically onto Zd\u22121 \u2295 {0} \u2282 Zd . Accordingly, we may assume that H =\nZd\u22121 \u2295 {0}. By the induction hypothesis, A\u03b8|H is a simple AT algebra with real\nrank zero. So Proposition 3.1 implies that A\u03b8 is a simple AT algebra with real rank\nzero.\nNow assume there is no such subgroup H0 of rank d\u22121. Let B be as in Lemma 3.4,\nwith\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c11,1\n\u03c11,2\n,\nB t \u03b8B =\n(\u03c11,2 )t \u03c12,2\nand where in particular all the entries of \u03c11,2 are in Z. Then AB t \u03b8B \u223c\n= A\u03c1 for\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c11,1\n0\n.\n\u03c1=\n0\n\u03c12,2\nUsing the definitions of A\u03c1 , A\u03c11,1 , and A\u03c12,2 as universal algebras on generators\nand relations, one easily checks that A\u03c1 \u223c\n= A\u03c11,1 \u2297 A\u03c12,2 . By the induction hypothesis, both A\u03c11,1 and A\u03c12,2 are simple AT algebras with real rank zero. Therefore\nA\u03c11,1 \u2297 A\u03c12,2 is a simple direct limit, with no dimension growth, of homogeneous\nC*-algebras. Since it has a unique tracial state, Theorems 1 and 2 of [2] imply that\nA\u03c1 has stable rank one and real rank zero. This algebra has weakly unperforated\nK-theory by Theorem 6.1 of [32]. (Actually, this is true for any direct limit of the\n\n\fSIMPLE HIGHER DIMENSIONAL NONCOMMUTATIVE TORUS\n\n17\n\ntype at hand.) It now follows from Theorem 4.6 of [21] that A\u03c11,1 \u2297 A\u03c12,2 has tracial\nrank zero. So Corollary 3.3 shows that A\u03b8 has tracial rank zero.\nWe note that one could use the earlier Theorem 3.11 of [11] to show that A\u03c11,1 \u2297\nA\u03c12,2 is an AT algebra with real rank zero, from which it follows that this algebra\nhas tracial rank zero. The use of H. Lin's classification theorem, Theorem 5.2 of [23],\nremains essential, because we can only prove that crossed products and fixed point\nalgebras of actions by finite cyclic groups with the tracial Rokhlin property preserve\ntracial rank zero, not that they the property of being an AT algebra or even an\nAH algebra.\nRemark 3.6. Since the paper [14] remains unpublished, it is worth pointing out\nthat the proof of Theorem 3.5 does not actually depend on this paper. In the\nproof of Lemma 1.13, we need to know that the ordinary irrational rotation algebras have real rank zero, but this follows from Remark 6 of [10]. In the proof of\nProposition 2.10, we need to know that traces determine order on projections in A\u03b8\nwhenever A\u03b8 is simple. The proof of this in [3] does not rely on [14], and in any case\nan independent proof (valid whenever \u03b8 is not purely rational) is contained in [32].\nAnd in the application of Theorem 6.4 of [18] in the proof of Proposition 3.1, we\nuse the fact that A\u03b1 has a unique tracial state, rather than real rank zero, to show\nthat Kishimoto's conditions hold.\nTo finish the proof that A\u03b8 is an AT algebra, we use the following consequence\nof H. Lin's classification theorem [23] for C*-algebras with tracial rank zero. This\nresult is well known, but we have been unable to find it explicitly in the literature.\nAccordingly, we give it here. We include the AH and AF cases as well as the AT case\nfor convenient reference elsewhere, because they have the same proof, although we\ndo not use them here.\nRecall that an AH algebra is a direct limit of finite direct sums of corners of\nhomogeneous C*-algebras whose primitive ideal spaces are finite CW complexes.\nSee, for example, the statement of Theorem 4.6 of [12], except that we omit the\nrestrictions there on the type of CW complexes which may appear; or see 2.5 of [19].\nProposition 3.7. Let A be a simple infinite dimensional separable unital nuclear\nC*-algebra with tracial rank zero and which satisfies the Universal Coefficient Theorem (Theorem 1.17 of [36]). Then A is a simple AH algebra with real rank zero\nand no dimension growth. If K\u2217 (A) is torsion free, then A is an AT algebra. If, in\naddition, K1 (A) = 0, then A is an AF algebra.\nProof. Theorems 6.11 and 6.13 of [20] show that K0 (A) is weakly unperforated and\nsatisfies the Riesz interpolation property (equivalently, by Proposition 2.1 of [13],\nthe Riesz decomposition property). We now apply Theorem 4.20 of [12] to find a\nunital AH algebra B with real rank zero and no dimension growth whose ordered\nscaled K-theory is the same as that of A. Since A is simple, so is the partially\nordered group K0 (A), and therefore B is also simple. If K\u2217 (A) is torsion free,\nwe claim that there is a simple AT algebra B with real rank zero whose ordered\nscaled K-theory is the same as that of A. To prove this, note that K0 (A) can't be\nZ because A has real rank zero; then we apply the proof of Theorem 8.3 of [9]. (As\nnoted in the introduction to [9], the part of the order involving K1 is irrelevant in\nthe simple case.) We can certainly take the groups in the direct limit decomposition\nto be torsion free, so that the proof shows that all the algebras in the direct system\n\n\f18\n\nN. CHRISTOPHER PHILLIPS\n\nconstructed there may be taken to have primitive ideal space the circle or a point.\nThen Theorem 4.3 of [9] shows they may all be taken to have primitive ideal space\nthe circle. This gives the required AT algebra B. Finally, if in addition K1 (A) = 0,\nfollowing [7] we may find a simple AF algebra B whose ordered scaled K-theory is\nthe same as that of A.\nProposition 2.6 of [19] (with C as defined in 2.5 of [19]) implies that simple\nAH algebras with real rank zero and no dimension growth have tracial rank zero.\nIn particular, B has tracial rank zero. So the classification theorem for C*-algebras\nwith tracial rank zero, Theorem 5.2 of [23], implies that A \u223c\n= B.\nTheorem 3.8. Let \u03b8 be a nondegenerate skew symmetric real d \u00d7 d matrix, with\nd \u2265 2. Then A\u03b8 is a simple AT algebra with real rank zero.\nProof. Using Theorem 1.17 of [36] (see the preceding discussion for the definition of\nN ), it follows from Lemma 1.5 that A\u03b8 satisfies the Universal Coefficient Theorem.\nClearly A\u03b8 is separable and nuclear. Since\nn\u22121\n\nK0 (A\u03b2 ) \u223c\n= K1 (A\u03b2 ) \u223c\n= Z2\n\nby Lemma 1.5 and by repeated application of the Pimsner-Voiculescu exact sequence [31], Theorem 3.5 and Proposition 3.7 imply that A\u03b8 is a simple AT algebra\nwith real rank zero.\nWe now consider the isomorphism and Morita equivalence classification of simple\nhigher dimensional noncommutative tori. For a nondegenerate skew symmetric real\nd \u00d7 d matrix \u03b8, Elliott [8] has determined the range of the unique tracial state \u03c4\u03b8\nacting on K0 (A\u03b8 ), in terms of the \"exterior exponential\" exp\u2227 (\u03b8) : \u039beven Zd \u2192 R.\nWe regard \u03b8 as a linear map from Zd \u2227 Zd to R. Following [8], if \u03c6 : \u039bk Zd \u2192 R and\n\u03c8 : \u039bl Zd \u2192 R are linear, we take, by a slight abuse of notation, \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8 : \u039bk+l Zd \u2192 R\nto be the functional obtained from the alternating functional on (Zd )k+l defined as\nthe antisymmetrization of\n(x1 , x2 , . . . , xk+l ) 7\u2192 \u03c6(x1 \u2227 x2 \u2227 * * * \u2227 xk )\u03c8(xk+1 \u2227 xk+2 \u2227 * * * \u2227 xk+l ).\nIn a similar way, we take \u03c6 \u2295 \u03c8 : \u039bk Zd \u2295 \u039bl Zd \u2192 R to be (\u03be, \u03b7) 7\u2192 \u03c6(\u03be) + \u03c8(\u03b7).\nThen by definition\nexp\u2227 (\u03b8) = 1 \u2295 \u03b8 \u2295 21 (\u03b8 \u2227 \u03b8) \u2295 61 (\u03b8 \u2227 \u03b8 \u2227 \u03b8) \u2295 * * * : \u039bevenZd \u2192 R.\nElliott's result for the nondegenerate case is then as follows.\nTheorem 3.9. Let \u03b8 be a nondegenerate skew symmetric real d \u00d7 d matrix. Then\nthere is an isomorphism h : K0 (A\u03b8j ) \u2192 \u039beven Zd such that exp\u2227 (\u03b8) \u25e6 h = (\u03c4\u03b8j )\u2217 , and\nsuch that h([1]) is the standard generator 1 \u2208 \u039b0 (Zd ) = Z.\nProof. This is 1.3, Theorem 2.2, and Theorem 3.1 of [8].\nFor the Morita equivalence result, we need the following lemma.\nLemma 3.10. Let G1 and G2 be finitely generated free abelian groups with the\nsame rank, and let f1 : G1 \u2192 R and f2 : G2 \u2192 R be homomorphisms with the same\nrange. Then there exists an isomorphism g : G1 \u2192 G2 such that f2 \u25e6 g = f1 .\nProof. Let D \u2282 R be the common range. Then D is a finitely generated subgroup\nof R, so is free. Let t1 , t2 , . . . , tk \u2208 D form a basis.\n\n\fSIMPLE HIGHER DIMENSIONAL NONCOMMUTATIVE TORUS\n\n19\n\nChoose \u03b71 , \u03b72 , . . . , \u03b7k \u2208 G1 such that f1 (\u03b7j ) = tj for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k. Choose elements\n\u03b7k+1 , \u03b7k+2 , . . . , \u03b7n \u2208 G1 which form a basis for Ker(f1 ). We claim\nP that \u03b71 , \u03b72 , . . . , \u03b7n\nform a basis for G1 .

Apply\nf1 to get \u03b11 = \u03b12 = * * * = \u03b1k = 0, and use linear independence of \u03b7k+1 , \u03b7k+2 , . . . , \u03b7n .\nTo show that they span G1 , let \u03b7 \u2208 G1 , choose \u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1k \u2208 Z such that\nPk\nPk\nf1 (\u03b7) =\nj=1 \u03b1j \u03b7j \u2208 Ker(f1 ) to write this element as\nj=1 \u03b1j tj , and use \u03b7 \u2212\nan integer combination of \u03b7k+1 , \u03b7k+2 , . . . , \u03b7n .\nSimilarly, there is a basis \u03bc1 , \u03bc2 , . . . , \u03bcn for G2 such that g(\u03bcj ) = tj for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k\nand g(\u03bcj ) = 0 for k + 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n. (It has the same number of elements because\nG1 and G2 have the same rank.) The required isomorphism g is now defined by\nspecifying g(\u03b7j ) = \u03bcj for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n.\nTheorem 3.11. Let \u03b81 and \u03b82 be nondegenerate skew symmetric real d\u00d7d matrices,\nwith d \u2265 2. Then A\u03b81 is strongly Morita equivalent to A\u03b82 if and only if there exists\n\u03bb > 0 such that exp\u2227 (\u03b81 ) and \u03bb exp\u2227 (\u03b82 ) have the same range.\nProof. By Theorem 3.9, the condition is equivalent to the existence of \u03bb > 0 such\nthat (\u03c4\u03b81 )\u2217 and \u03bb(\u03c4\u03b82 )\u2217 have the same range.\nThe condition is certainly necessary. For sufficiency, use Lemma 3.10 to find\nan isomorphism g : K0 (A\u03b81 ) \u2192 K0 (A\u03b82 ) such that \u03bb(\u03c4\u03b82 )\u2217 \u25e6 g = (\u03c4\u03b81 )\u2217 . Since A\u03b82\nhas tracial rank zero, there are n \u2208 N and a projection p \u2208 Mn (A\u03b82 ) such that\n[p] = g([1]). Then A\u03b81 and pMn (A\u03b82 )p have isomorphic Elliott invariants, so A\u03b81 \u223c\n=\npMn (A\u03b82 )p by Theorem 5.2 of [23].\nFor the isomorphism classification, we have:\nTheorem 3.12. Let \u03b81 and \u03b82 be nondegenerate skew symmetric real d\u00d7d matrices,\nwith d \u2265 2. Then A\u03b81 \u223c\n= A\u03b82 if and only if there is an isomorphism g : \u039beven Zd \u2192\neven d\n\u039b\nZ such that exp\u2227 (\u03b82 ) \u25e6 g = exp\u2227 (\u03b81 ) and such that g sends the standard\ngenerator 1 \u2208 \u039b0 (Zd ) = Z to itself.\nProof. By Theorem 3.9, the condition is equivalent to isomorphism of the Elliott\ninvariants of A\u03b81 and A\u03b82 . Apply Theorem 5.2 of [23].\nOne might hope that it would suffice to require that (\u03c4\u03b81 )\u2217 and (\u03c4\u03b82 )\u2217 have the\nsame range. We show by example that this is not true.\nExample 3.13.

CHRISTOPHER PHILLIPS\n\nTo prove (1), we verify the condition of Lemma 1.7. Thus, suppose x \u2208 Qd and\nhx, \u03b8l yi \u2208 Q for all y \u2208 Qd . Putting y = (1, 0, 0), we get \u2212\u03b2x2 \u2212 \u03b3x3 \u2208 Q, whence\nx2 = x3 = 0. Putting y = (0, 1, 0) and using x3 = 0, we get \u03b2x1 \u2208 Q, whence\nx1 = 0. So x = 0, proving nondegeneracy.\nFor the proofs of (2) and (3), apply Theorem 3.9 to \u03b81 and \u03b82 , obtaining isomorphisms h1 and h2 . Use exp\u2227 (\u03b8l ) \u25e6 hl = (\u03c4\u03b8l )\u2217 , and identify \u039b2 Z3 with Z3 in such\na way that \u03b8l , regarded as a linear map from Zd \u2227 Zd to R, sends the standard\nbasis elements to \u03bbl , \u03b2, and \u03b3. Thus there are isomorphisms hl : K0 (A\u03b8l ) \u2192 Z4\nsuch that hl ([1]) = (1, 0, 0, 0) and such that the map fl : Z4 \u2192 R given by n 7\u2192\nn1 + \u03bbl n2 + \u03b2n3 + \u03b3n4 satisfies (\u03c4\u03b8l )\u2217 = fl \u25e6 hl .\nWe prove (2) by showing that the ranges of f1 and f2 are equal to 51 Z + \u03b2Z + \u03b3Z.\nThis is obvious for f2 . Also, it is obvious that\n1, 25 , \u03b2, \u03b3 \u2208 f1 (Z4 ) \u2282 51 Z + \u03b2Z + \u03b3Z,\nwhence also f1 (Z4 ) = 51 Z + \u03b2Z + \u03b3Z.\nWe turn to the proof of (3). It suffices to show that there is no isomorphism\ng : Z4 \u2192 Z4 such that f2 \u25e6 g = f1 and g(1, 0, 0, 0) = (1, 0, 0, 0). Suppose we had such\na map g. The equation g(1, 0, 0, 0) = (1, 0, 0, 0) determines the first column of the\nmatrix of g. Since\nf2 (0, 2, 0, 0) = 25 ,\n\nf2 (0, 0, 1, 0) = \u03b2,\n\nand f2 (0, 0, 0, 1) = \u03b3,\n\nthe other columns are determined by\ng(0, 1, 0, 0) \u2208 (0, 2, 0, 0) + Ker(f2 ),\n\ng(0, 0, 1, 0) \u2208 (0, 0, 1, 0) + Ker(f2 ),\n\nand\ng(0, 0, 0, 1) \u2208 (0, 0, 0, 1) + Ker(f2 ).\nNow\nKer(f2 ) = {(\u2212r, 5r, 0, 0) \u2208 Z4 : r \u2208 Z}.\nSo there are r, s, t \u2208 Z such that\n\uf8eb\n\n1\n\u2212r\n\uf8ec 0 2 + 5r\ng=\uf8ec\n\uf8ed 0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\u2212s \u2212t\n5s 5t \uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n1\n0 \uf8f8\n0\n1\n\nNow g can be invertible only if 2 + 5r = \u00b11, which is not possible for r \u2208 Z. This\nproves (3).\nWe do, however, get the following result. Recall that the opposite algebra Aop\nof a C*-algebra A is the algebra A with the multiplication reversed but all other\noperations, including the scalar multiplication, the same.\nCorollary 3.14. Let \u03b8 be a nondegenerate skew symmetric real d \u00d7 d matrix, with\nd \u2265 2. Then (A\u03b8 )op \u223c\n= A\u03b8 .\nProof. Using classification (for example, Theorem 5.2 of [23]), one sees that every\nsimple AT algebra A with real rank zero is isomorphic to its opposite algebra,\nbecause the ordered K-theory of Aop is the same as the ordered K-theory of A.\nAs far as we know, it is unknown whether (A\u03b8 )op \u223c\n= A\u03b8 for general degenerate \u03b8.\n\n\fSIMPLE HIGHER DIMENSIONAL NONCOMMUTATIVE TORUS\n\n21\n\nCorollary 3.15. Under the hypotheses of Proposition 2.10, and with the additional\ncondition n 6= 1, the action of Zn on A\u03b8 generated by \u03b1 does not have the Rokhlin\nproperty.\nProof. Clearly this action is trivial on K\u2217 (A\u03b8 ). It follows from Theorem 3.8 that\nthe hypotheses on the algebra in Theorem 3.5 of [16] are satisfied. This theorem\nimplies, in particular, that if the action had the Rokhlin property, then A\u03b8 would\nbe isomorphic to its tensor product with the n\u221e UHF algebra. The K-theory shows\nthis is impossible.\nReferences\n[1] J. Anderson and W. Paschke, The rotation algebra, Houston J. Math. 15(1989), 1\u201326.\n[2] B. Blackadar, M. D\u01ced\u01cerlat, and M.
