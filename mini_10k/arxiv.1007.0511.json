Introduction\nLet K be a field with a non-Archimedean discrete valuation v : K\u2217 \u2192 Z with valuation ring\nO and residue field the complex numbers C. Tropicalization is a procedure which assigns\nto a d-dimensional subvariety X \u25e6 of the torus (K\u2217 )n , a polyhedral complex Trop(X \u25e6 ) \u2282 Rn\nof pure dimension d, such that the rational points of Trop(X \u25e6 ) parametrize the 'interesting'\ninitial degenerations inw X \u25e6 of X \u25e6 . It is a natural question to ask which geometric properties\nof X \u25e6 can be recovered from the combinatorial data Trop(X \u25e6 ), together with the algebraic\ngeometric data of the initial degenerations.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 14T05 (primary), 14D05 (secondary).\nKey words and phrases. tropical geometry, monodromy, Hodge theory.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nERIC KATZ AND ALAN STAPLEDON\n\nConsider a pair (X \u25e6 , \u03a3), where \u03a3 is a polyhedral structure on Trop(X \u25e6 ) that can be\nextended to a polyhedral subdivision of Rn and which is tropical in the sense of Tevelev (see\nDefinition 2.2). We introduce a new invariant \u03c8(X \u25e6, \u25b3) , called the tropical motivic nearby\nfiber, which lies in the Grothendieck ring K0 (VarC ) of complex algebraic varieties. More\nprecisely, K0 (VarC ) is the free Z-module generated by isomorphism classes [V ] of complex\nvarieties V , modulo the relation [V ] = [U] + [V r U], whenever U is an open subvariety of\nV . If we set L := [A1 ], then the tropical motivic nearby fiber is defined by\nX\n\u03c8(X \u25e6, \u25b3) =\n[XF\u25e6 ] (1 \u2212 L)dim F \u2212dim \u03c4F ,\nF \u2208\u03a3\n\nwhere inw X \u25e6 \u223c\n= XF\u25e6 \u00d7 (C\u2217 )dim F for any w in the relative interior of F , and \u03c4F denotes the recession cone of F . Our first main result (Theorem 3.6) states that the tropical motivic nearby\nfiber is independent of the choice of polyhedral structure \u03a3, provided that the corresponding\nrecession fan \u25b3 = {\u03c4F | F \u2208 \u03a3} is fixed.\n\nFor the remainder of the introduction, we will assume that X \u25e6 is sch\u00f6n in the sense of\nTevelev (see Definition 2.5), and that the recession fan \u25b3 is unimodular. Let O be the\nring of germs of analytic functions in C in a neighborhood of the origin, with the valuation\nequal to the vanishing order of a function at the origin. Then X \u25e6 induces a a family of\nsubvarieties of (C\u2217 )n over a punctured disc D\u2217 about the origin, and the recession fan \u25b3\ninduces a compactification X \u25e6 \u2286 X, and a smooth, proper map f : X \u2192 D\u2217 (see Section 5).\nThe motivic nearby fiber \u03c8f \u2208 K0 (VarC ) of f was introduced by Denef and Loeser [12],\nand encodes information about the variation of Hodge structure of a fiber Xgen of f . In\nfact, the motivic nearby fiber was introduced as a specialization of an invariant of a suitable\nextension of f to a family over D, called the motivic zeta function, which is defined using\nmotivic integration. Our second main result is the following.\nTheorem (Theorem 5.1). With the notation above, if X \u25e6 is sch\u00f6n and \u25b3 is a unimodular\nrecession fan associated to the tropical variety Trop(X \u25e6 ), then \u03c8(X \u25e6 ,\u25b3) = \u03c8f .\nThis result has a number of Hodge-theoretic and topological consequences. By the results\nof Steenbrink and others [38], the cohomology of a fixed non-zero fiber Xgen of f carries\na limit mixed Hodge structure. In particular, the associated limit Hodge numbers\nhp,q (H m (X\u221e )) refine the Hodge numbers hp,m\u2212p (Xgen ) of Xgen (5), and record the sizes of\nthe Jordan blocks of the logarithm of the monodromy operator on the cohomology of Xgen .\nWe may consider the ring homomorphism\nE : K0 (VarC ) \u2192 Z[u, v], E([V ]) = E(V ),\nwhich takes a complex variety V to its Hodge-Deligne polynomial E(V ), and satisfies E(L) =\nuv (see Section 4). Composition with the homomorphism Z[u, v] \u2192 Z obtained by setting\nu = v = 1, gives the homomorphism\ne : K0 (VarC ) \u2192 Z,\nwhich takes a complex variety V to its topological Euler characteristic e(V ). With the\nnotation of the theorem above, Corollary 5.2 states that the tropical motivic nearby fiber\nspecializes to\n!\nX X\nm p,q\nm\nE(\u03c8(X \u25e6 ,\u25b3)) = E(X\u221e ; u, v) :=\n(\u22121) h (H (X\u221e )) up v q ,\np,q\n\nm\n\n\f3\n\nand the topological Euler characteristic of Xgen is given by\nX\ne(Xgen ) = e(\u03c8(X \u25e6 ,\u25b3) ) =\ne(XF\u25e6 ).\nF \u2208\u03a3\ndim F =dim \u03c4F\n\nThe parameterizing complex \u0393X \u25e6 of Trop(X \u25e6 ) is a polyhedral complex which was introduced in [16] and admits a natural map p : \u0393X \u25e6 \u2192 Trop(X \u25e6 ) (see Section 2). Continuing\nwith the notation of the theorem above, in Corollary 5.3, we show that the Betti numbers\nof \u0393X \u25e6 satisfy\nbm (\u0393X \u25e6 ) \u2264 min hp,q (Xgen ).\np+q=m\n\nThis strengthens the result of Helm and the first named author [16, Corollary 5.8] that\nbm (Xgen )\n.\nm+1\nWe refer the reader to Corollary 5.4 for a further upper bound on bd (\u0393X \u25e6 ).\nbm (\u0393X \u25e6 ) \u2264\n\nFinally, to use the tropical motivic nearby fiber to compute the polynomial E(X\u221e ; u, v),\none needs to know the Hodge-Deligne polynomials of the complex varieties XF\u25e6 . In addition\nto the easy case where X \u25e6 is a curve, we explore two cases where this is possible: when X \u25e6\nis a sch\u00f6n hypersurface and when Trop(X \u25e6 ) is a smooth tropical variety.\nIn the case when X \u25e6 is a hypersurface, the varieties XF\u25e6 are sch\u00f6n hypersurfaces in complex\ntori. Their Hodge-Deligne numbers are determined by their Newton polytopes by a result of\nDanilov and Khovanskii [10], and hence one obtains a combinatorial formula for E(X\u221e ; u, v).\nIn fact, the tropical variety is dual to a regular, lattice polyhedral decomposition T of the\nNewton polytope P of X \u25e6 in Rd+1 , and one obtains combinatorial formulas for the limit\nHodge numbers hp,q (H m (X\u221e )) in terms of T (Corollary 6.1). In particular, Corollary 6.5\nstates that for p > 0,\nX\n#(Int(Q) \u2229 Zn ),\nhp,0(H d (X\u221e )) =\nQ\u2208T (0)\ndim Q=p+1\n\nwhere T (0) denotes the faces of T whose relative interior lies in the relative interior of P .\nAlso,\nX\n#(Int(Q) \u2229 Zn ).\nh0,0 (H d(X\u221e )) =\nQ\u2208T (0)\ndim Q\u22641\n\nMatroidal tropical varieties are polyhedral complexes locally modeled on the matroid fans\nof Ardila and Klivans [1]. There were originally called smooth tropical varieties by Mikhalkin\n[22]. If Trop(X \u25e6 ) is a matroidal tropical variety, then X \u25e6 is sch\u00f6n. Moreover, the initial\ndegenerations of X \u25e6 are all intersections of linear subspaces of Pn with (C\u2217 )n . Their HodgeDeligne numbers are determined by the matroid of that linear space due to the work of Orlik\nand Solomon [27]. Hence we determine a combinatorial formula for the tropical motivic fiber\n\u03c8(X \u25e6, \u25b3) (Corollary 7.12). As an immediate consequence, we deduce the following formula for\nthe Euler characteristic of a general fiber (Corollary 7.13),\nX\n(\u03c7MF (1) + \u03c7\u2032M (1)),\ne(Xgen ) =\nF\n\nF \u2208\u03a3\ndim(F )=dim(\u03c4F )\n\n\f4\n\nERIC KATZ AND ALAN STAPLEDON\n\nwhere \u03c7MF (q) denotes the characteristic polynomial of the matroid MF associated to the star\nquotient of F (see Section 7), and \u03c7\u2032M (q) denotes the derivative of \u03c7MF (q).\nF\n\nWe mention some related work. In [14], Gross and Siebert construct a scheme X0 from\ncertain combinatorial data. If X0 is embedded in a family X over O, they determine the limit\nmixed Hodge structure in terms of the combinatorial data. In [31], Ruddat gives a spectral\nsequence for determining the logarithmic Hodge groups of toric log Calabi-Yau spaces of\nhypersurface type in terms of tropical degeneration data and Jacobian rings. In [16], Helm\nand the first named author relate the topology of the parameterizing complex \u0393X \u25e6 to the\nmonodromy filtration on H \u2217 (Xgen ) for sch\u00f6n subvarieties X \u25e6 \u2282 (K\u2217 )n .\nNotation and conventions. All schemes are over the complex numbers. For us, a variety is\na not necessarily irreducible, separated reduced scheme of finite type over C. Cohomology\nwill be taken with Q coefficients, with respect to the usual (complex) topology.\nAcknowledgements.

Tropical geometry\nWe review some notions for studying tropical geometry in the non-constant coefficient case.\nMany of these were developed by Tevelev [39] and Hacking [15] in the constant coefficient\ncase and extended to the non-constant coefficient case by Luxton-Qu [20], Qu [30] and HelmKatz [16]. Let K be a field with a non-Archimedean discrete valuation v : K\u2217 \u2192 Z. Let O\nbe its valuation ring with residue field k. The examples to keep in mind are\n(1) K = C((t)), O = C[[t]], and k = C,\n(2) K = C(t), O = C[t](t) , and k = C,\n(3) O is the ring of germs of analytic functions in C in a neighborhood of the origin, K\nis its field of fractions, and k = C.\nWe suppose for ease of exposition that there is a section of the extension of the valuation\n\u2217\n\u2217\nv : K \u2192 Q given by Q \u220b w 7\u2192 tw \u2208 K . Let T \u223c\n= Gnm be a split n-dimensional torus over O,\nand let T = T \u00d7O K be the corresponding torus over K. Let N be the cocharacter lattice,\nN = Hom(K\u2217 , T ) and NR = N \u2297 R. For w = (w1 , . . . , wn ) \u2208 Qn , write tw = (tw1 , . . . , twn ) \u2208\nT.\nLet X \u25e6 be a subvariety of T and w \u2208\ninw X \u25e6 \u2282 (k\u2217 )n is given by\n\n1 n\nZ ,\nM\n\ninw X \u25e6 = t\u2212w XK\u25e6 \u2032 \u00d7O\u2032 k\nwhere the closure is taken in T .\n\n1\n\nlet K\u2032 = K[[t M ]]. Then the initial degeneration,\n\n\f5\n\nDefinition 2.1. The tropical variety Trop(X \u25e6 ) associated to X \u25e6 is the closure in Rn of the\nset of points\n{w \u2208 Qn | inw X \u25e6 6= \u2205}.\nFor Xk\u25e6 \u2282 Tk , we define the tropicalization of Xk by base-change. Let K\u2032 = k((t)) and\n= X \u25e6 \u00d7k K\u2032 \u2282 (K\u2032\u2217 )n . Set Trop(Xk\u25e6 ) = Trop(XK\u25e6 \u2032 ).\nLet \u03a3 be a subcomplex of a rational polyhedral subdivision of Rn . One can define a toric\ne be the union of the cones over faces of \u03a3 \u00d7 {1} in\nscheme P(\u03a3) over O from \u03a3. First, let \u03a3\ne\nNR \u00d7R\u22650 . This forms a rational polyhedral fan in Rn \u00d7R\u22650 by Corollary 3.12 of [8]. Let P(\u03a3)\nbe the corresponding toric variety. The projection NR \u00d7 R\u22650 \u2192 R\u22650 induces a projection\ne \u2192 A1 . Let Spec O \u2192 A1 = Spec Z[u] be induced by the universal homomorphism\nP(\u03a3)\ne \u00d7Z[u] O. Let \u2206 be the recession fan of \u03a3, that is\nZ \u2192 O and u 7\u2192 t. Then P(\u03a3) = P(\u03a3)\ne \u2229 (NR \u00d7 {0}). The generic fiber of P(\u03a3) is the toric variety P(\u2206). For\nthe fan given by \u03a3\ncones \u03c3 \u2208 \u2206, let U\u03c3 be the corresponding torus orbit of P(\u2206). See [16, Section 2] for a more\ndetailed description of the relevant construction.\nXK\u25e6 \u2032\n\nFaces F \u2208 \u03a3 correspond to torus orbits UF contained in the central fiber of P. There\nis an inclusion reversing correspondence F 7\u2192 U F between faces and orbit closures. The\ntorus orbits UF give a decomposition of the central fiber of P. We define TF \u2282 Tk to\nbe the torus fixing UF pointwise and NF to be the cocharacter lattice of TF . Note that\nNF = SpanR (F \u2212 w) \u2229 N where w \u2208 Int(F ).\nLet X denote the closure of X \u25e6 in P(\u03a3), and let X be the generic fiber of X .\nDefinition 2.2. The pair (X \u25e6 , P(\u03a3)) is tropical if the map\nm : T \u00d7O X \u2192 P(\u03a3)\nis faithfully flat, and X \u2192 O is proper.\nWe then have the following, due to Tevelev [39] in the constant coefficient case. In the\nnon-constant coefficient case they can be found in [20].\nProposition 2.3. [20, Proposition 6.8] If X \u25e6 is not invariant under any torus in T , then\nthere is a toric scheme P(\u03a3) such that (X \u25e6 , P(\u03a3)) is tropical.\nIn addition, \u03a3 in the above proposition can be chosen to be a subcomplex of a rational\npolyhedral subdivision of Rn . Moreover, tropical pairs are stable under refinement according\nto the following:\nProposition 2.4. [20, Proposition 6.7] Suppose (X \u25e6 , P(\u03a3)) is tropical and P(\u03a3\u2032 ) \u2192 P(\u03a3)\nis a morphism of toric schemes corresponding to a refinement \u03a3\u2032 of \u03a3. Then (X \u25e6 , P(\u03a3\u2032 )) is\ntropical. Moreover, X \u2032 = X \u25e6 \u2282 P(\u03a3\u2032 ) is the inverse image of X .\nIf (X \u25e6 , P) is tropical, then |\u03a3| = Trop(X \u25e6 ) by [20, Proposition 6.5], so \u03a3 induces a polyhedral structure on Trop(X \u25e6 ). The central fiber X0 of X can be written as a union of locally\nclosed subschemes labelled by faces of \u03a3. Let XF\u25e6 = X \u2229 UF . Let XF denote the closure of\nXF\u25e6 in X . For w \u2208 Int F , the initial degeneration, inw X \u25e6 is invariant under the torus TF .\nMoreover, there is a non-canonical isomorphism\ninw X \u25e6 \u223c\n= TF \u00d7 XF\u25e6 .\n\n\f6\n\nERIC KATZ AND ALAN STAPLEDON\n\nIn this case, Trop(inw X \u25e6 ) is invariant under translation by elements in (NF )R . If F is a topdimensional cell of \u03a3, then m(F ), the multiplicity of F is the length of the zero-dimensional\nscheme inw X \u25e6 /TF . With these multiplicities \u03a3 is a balanced weighted rational polyhedral\ncomplex.\nThere is a natural notion of smoothness called sch\u00f6nness.\nDefinition 2.5. A subvariety X \u25e6 of T is sch\u00f6n if there exists a tropical pair (X \u25e6 , P) such\nthat the multiplication map\nm : T \u00d7O X \u2192 P\nis smooth.\nProposition 2.6. (Luxton-Qu) [20, Theorem 6.13] Let X \u25e6 be sch\u00f6n. If \u03a3 is any polyhedral\ncomplex supported on Trop(X \u25e6 ), then (X \u25e6 , P(\u03a3)) is tropical. Furthermore, the multiplication\nmap m : T \u00d7O X \u2192 P(\u03a3) is smooth.\nSch\u00f6nness has a characterization in terms of initial degenerations (ref. [15, Lemma 2.7]).\nProposition 2.7. The following are equivalent:\n(1) X \u25e6 is sch\u00f6n.\n(2) inw X \u25e6 is smooth for all w \u2208 Trop(X \u25e6 ).\nThe notions of tropical pairs and sch\u00f6n varieties originated in the work of Tevelev [39] and\nwere extended to the non-constant coefficient case by Luxton-Qu [20]. We can speak of a\nsubvariety X \u25e6 \u2282 (k\u2217 )n being part of a tropical pair and being sch\u00f6n. Let P = P(\u2206) be a toric\nvariety, and let X be the closure of X \u25e6 in P. (X \u25e6 , P) is said to be tropical if m : Tk \u00d7 X \u2192 P\nis faithfully flat and X is proper. If m is smooth, then X \u25e6 is said to be sch\u00f6n.\nThe sch\u00f6n condition is especially important when the toric scheme P is a semi-stable\ndegeneration of toric varieties. One can always refine a toric scheme so that we are in this\ncase by the following proposition:\nProposition 2.8. [16, Proposition 2.3] Let \u03a3 be a rational polyhedral complex in NR . There\nexists an integer d and a subdivision \u03a3\u2032 of d\u03a3 such the general fiber of P(\u03a3\u2032 ) is a smooth toric\nvariety and the special fiber of P(\u03a3\u2032 ) is a divisor with simple normal crossings. Moreover, if\nthe generic fiber P(\u03a3)K is already smooth, \u03a3\u2032 can be chosen to have the same recession fan\nas \u03a3.\nThe above proposition can be used to extend a sch\u00f6n variety X \u25e6 to a scheme X with simple\nnormal crossings degeneration. Let (X \u25e6 , P(\u03a3)) be a tropical pair. Choose P(\u03a3\u2032 ) as above.\n1\nAfter making a ramified base-change Spec O[t d ] \u2192 Spec O, we have a smooth morphism\nm : T \u00d7O X \u2192 P(\u03a3\u2032 ) where X is the closure of X \u25e6 in P(\u03a3\u2032 ). Consequently, the generic fiber\nof X is smooth and the central fiber X0 is a divisor in X with simple normal crossings. In\nsuch a case, we call (X \u25e6 , P(\u03a3\u2032 )) a normal crossings pair.\nLemma 2.9. If X \u25e6 is sch\u00f6n then it is smooth.\nProof. Choose P = P(\u03a3) as in Proposition 2.8. Then m : T \u00d7O X \u2192 P is smooth. Restricting\nto the generic fiber, we have m : T \u00d7 X \u2192 PK is smooth. Since PK is smooth over K, T \u00d7 X\nis smooth. It follows that X and hence X \u25e6 is smooth.\n\u0003\nThe same argument gives the following lemma:\n\n\f7\n\nLemma 2.10. Let X \u25e6 \u2282 (k\u2217 )n be a sch\u00f6n subvariety. Let P(\u2206) be a smooth toric variety\nsuch that (X \u25e6 , P(\u2206)) is a tropical pair. Then X, the closure of X \u25e6 in P(\u2206), is smooth.\nLemma 2.11. If X \u25e6 is sch\u00f6n and (X \u25e6 , P) is a tropical pair, then each XF\u25e6 is sch\u00f6n as a\nsubscheme of UF .\nProof. Let VF = U F be an orbit closure. By base-changing m : T \u00d7O X \u2192 P to VF , we\nobtain smooth m : Tk \u00d7 XF \u2192 VF . Now, the torus TF acts trivially on VF from which we\nobtain that\nm : (T /TF )k \u00d7 XF \u2192 VF\nis smooth.\n\n\u0003\n\nSuppose X \u25e6 is sch\u00f6n. Associated to a normal crossings pair (X \u25e6 , P) is the parameterizing\ncomplex \u0393(X \u25e6 ,P) which has appeared in the literature a number of times (notably, in the work\nof Speyer [35] in the case of curves and in the work of Hacking [15] in the constant coefficient\ncase). We use the definitions introduced in Section 4 of [16]. There, the faces of \u0393(X \u25e6 ,P) are\npairs (F, Y ) where F is a face of \u03a3 and Y is an irreducible component of XF . Since (X \u25e6 , P)\nis a normal crossings pair, each XF is smooth by Lemma 2.10 so irreducible components do\nnot meet. A face (F \u2032 , Y \u2032 ) is on the boundary of (F, Y ) if and only if F \u2032 is a face of F and\nY \u2032 is the unique component of XF \u2032 containing Y . The complex \u0393(X \u25e6 ,P) naturally maps to \u03a3\nby the map (F, Y ) 7\u2192 F . The image of this map is Trop(X \u25e6 ). The bounded faces of \u0393(X \u25e6 ,P)\nform the dual complex of the semistable degeneration. The parameterizing complex can also\nbe thought of as the complex associated to the stratification given by components of XF for\nF \u2208 \u03a3. By [16, Proposition 4.1], the underlying topological space of \u0393(X \u25e6 ,P) is independent\nof the choice of P. When P is understood, we will denote the parameterizing complex by\n\u0393X \u25e6 .\nFor a face F \u2208 \u03a3, let Star\u03a3 (F ) be the star of F in \u03a3. It is a fan indexed by cells G \u2208 \u03a3\nthat contain F . Pick a point w in the relative interior of F . The cone G \u2208 Star\u03a3 (F ) is the\nset of all v \u2208 NR such that w + \u01ebv \u2208 \u03a3 for all sufficiently small \u01eb > 0. We define the star\nquotient to be \u2206F = Star\u03a3 (F )/(NF )R . If w \u2208 |\u03a3|, let F be the unique face containing w in\nits relative interior. Then the star quotient of \u03a3 at w is defined to be Star\u03a3 (F )/(NF )R .\nTropicalization of initial degenerations of X \u25e6 can be read from Trop(X \u25e6 ):\nLemma 2.12. [34, Proposition 2.2.3] Let (X \u25e6 , P) be a tropical pair. For w \u2208 | Trop(X \u25e6 )|,\nTrop(inw X \u25e6 ) = StarTrop(X \u25e6 ) (F )\nwhere F is the unique face of \u03a3 containing w in its relative interior.\n3. The Tropical Motivic Nearby Fiber\nThe goal of this section is to define the tropical motivic nearby fiber of a tropical variety,\nand show that it is independent of the choice of polyhedral structure on the tropical variety.\nWe continue with the notation of Section 2, and let (X \u25e6 , P) be tropical pair. Let \u03a3\ndenote the corresponding polyhedral structure on Trop(X \u25e6 ) \u2286 NR , with recession fan \u25b3.\nFor each face F of \u03a3, let XF\u25e6 denote the corresponding subvariety of the complex torus\nUF \u223c\n= (C\u2217 )codim F determined by F , and let \u03c4F denote the recession cone of F .\n\n\f8\n\nERIC KATZ AND ALAN STAPLEDON\n\nThe Grothendieck ring K0 (VarC ) of complex algebraic varieties is the free Z-module generated by isomorphism classes [V ] of complex varieties V , modulo the relation\n(1)\n\n[V ] = [U] + [V r U],\n\nwhenever U is an open subvariety of V . Multiplication is defined by\n[V ] * [W ] = [V \u00d7 W ],\nand we set L := [A1 ]. For example, we compute\n[(C\u2217 )n ] = [C\u2217 ]n = (L \u2212 1)n .\nDefinition 3.1.

Since XF\u25e6 may be non-reduced, we write [XF\u25e6 ] to denote the element corresponding to XF\u25e6 with its reduced structure in the Grothendieck ring. Observe that if X \u25e6 is\nsch\u00f6n, then XF\u25e6 is smooth, and hence reduced (see Proposition 2.7 and Remark 3.3 below).\n\nRemark 3.3. If inw X \u25e6 denotes the initial degeneration of X \u25e6 with respect to an element w\nin the relative interior of F , then\ninw X \u25e6 \u223c\n= X \u25e6 \u00d7 (C\u2217 )dim F .\nF\n\nHence\n\u03c8(X \u25e6, \u03a3) =\n\nX (\u22121)dim F [inw X \u25e6 ]\n.\ndim \u03c4F\n(1\n\u2212\nL)\nF \u2208\u03a3\n\nIf B is a finite poset, then the M\u00f6bius function \u03bcB : B \u00d7 B \u2192 Z (see Appendix A) satisfies\nthe property (known as 'M\u00f6bius inversion') that for any function h : B \u2192 A to an abelian\ngroup A,\nX\nX\n(2)\nh(z) =\n\u03bcB (y, z)g(y), where g(y) =\nh(x).\ny\u2264z\n\nx\u2264y\n\nIn the lemma below, we regard the empty face of a polytope as having dimension \u22121, and\nwrite \u03c4 \u2208 Int(Q) if the relative interior of \u03c4 is contained in the relative interior of Q.\n\nLemma 3.4.

The tropical motivic nearby fiber \u03c8(X \u25e6, \u03a3) = \u03c8(X \u25e6, \u25b3) of a tropical pair (X \u25e6 , P)\nis independent of the choice of polyhedral structure \u03a3 on Trop(X \u25e6 ), and only depends on the\ncorresponding recession fan \u25b3.\nProof. Suppose \u03a3\u2032 is a polyhedral structure on Trop(X \u25e6 ) induced by a tropical pair (X \u25e6 , P\u2032 ),\nand with the same recession fan \u25b3. After taking a common refinement, we may and will\nassume that \u03a3\u2032 is a refinement of \u03a3. Consider the corresponding proper morphism of toric\nvarieties P\u2032 \u2192 P. If F \u2032 is a face of \u03a3\u2032 , then the relative interior of F \u2032 lies in the relative\ninterior Int(F ) of a unique face F of \u03a3.

The Motivic Nearby Fiber and Limit Hodge Structures\nThe goal of this section is to recall some results on the motivic nearby fiber and limit\nmixed Hodge structure of a degeneration of complex varieties. We refer the reader to [6],\n[28] and [29] for details and proofs of the statements below.\nRecall from Section 3 that the assignment of a complex variety V to its class [V ] in the\nGrothendieck ring K0 (VarC ) is the universal invariant of complex varieties satisfying the\nrelation (1). We recall the following specialization of this invariant.\nIn [11], Deligne proved that the mth cohomology group with compact supports Hcm (V ) of\nevery d-dimensional complex algebraic variety V admits a canonical mixed Hodge structure.\nThat is, Hcm (V ) admits an increasing filtration W\u2022 called the weight filtration and a\ndecreasing filtration F \u2022 called the Hodge filtration, such that the Hodge filtration induces\na pure Hodge structure of weight k on the k th graded piece of the weight filtration. We refer\nthe reader to [28] for an introduction to mixed Hodge structures. In particular, we have an\ninduced decomposition\nM\nH p,q (Hcm (V )),\nHcm (V ) \u223c\n=\n0\u2264p,q\u2264d\n\nwhere H q,p (Hcm (V ; C)) = H p,q (Hcm (V )). Throughout, we write hp,q (Hcm (V )) = dim H p,q (Hcm (V )).\nIf\nX\nep,q (V ) = eq,p (V ) =\n(\u22121)m hp,q (Hcm (V )),\nm\n\nthen the Hodge-Deligne polynomial of V is defined by\nX\nE(V ) = E(V ; u, v) =\nep,q (V )up v q ,\np,q\n\nand there is a well-defined ring homomorphism\n\nE : K0 (VarC ) \u2192 Z[u, v], E([V ]) = E(V ).\n\n\f11\n\nRemark 4.1. In fact, the ring homomorphism above factors through a specialization\nP with\nvalues in the Grothendieck ring of complex Hodge structures K0 (hs), sending [V ] to m (\u22121)m Hcm (V )\n(see, for example, [28, Corollary 3]).\nL\nRemark 4.2. If V is smooth and complete, then H m (V ) = p+q=m H p,q (V ) admits a pure\nP\nHodge structure of weight m, and E(V ) = p,q (\u22121)p+q hp,q (V )up v q .\nRemark 4.3. By the above remark, E(P1 ) = uv +1, and hence E(L) = E(P1 )\u2212E(pt) = uv.\nRemark 4.4. For any variety V , E(V ; 1, 1) = e(V ) equals the topological Euler characteristic of V .\nLet Y be a smooth, connected, (d + 1)-dimensional (complex) manifold, and let f : Y \u2192 D\nbe a proper map to the unit disk D, which is smooth over the punctured disk D\u2217 = D r {0}.\nOne can associate to this data the motivic nearby fiber \u03c8f in K0 (VarC ), which is invariant\nunder base change of D, and satisfies the property that if Z is smooth and connected, and\n\u03c0 : Z \u2192 Y is an isomorphism away from the central fiber Y0 = f \u22121 (0), then \u03c8f = \u03c8f \u25e6\u03c0 [6,\nRemark 2.7]. If f is a semi-stable degeneration, in the sense that the central fiber Y0 is\na reduced, simple normal crossing divisor, then the motivic nearby fiber has the following\ndescription. If {Di }i\u2208{1,...,n} denotes the irreducible components of Y0 , and, for every nonempty subset I \u2286 {1, . . . , n}, we set DI\u25e6 = \u2229i\u2208I Di r \u222aj \u2208I\n/ Dj , then\nX\n(4)\n\u03c8f =\n[DI\u25e6 ](1 \u2212 L)|I|\u22121 .\nI\u2286{1,...,n}\n\nRemark 4.5. It follows from the discussion above that the motivic nearby fiber \u03c8f is\ndetermined by the smooth, proper map f : Y \u2032 = f \u22121 (D\u2217 ) \u2192 D\u2217 over the punctured disk.\nConversely, any smooth, proper map f : Y \u2032 \u2192 D\u2217 can be extended to a map f : Y \u2192 D,\nwhere Y is a connected manifold, i.e. by extending the family to D and resolving singularities,\nand hence one may consider the corresponding invariant \u03c8f .\nFor a fixed t \u2208 D\u2217 , the mth cohomology group of the smooth, complete fiber Yt , which\nwe will often denote Ygen , admits a mixed Hodge structure called the limit mixed Hodge\nstructure, which only depends on the family over D\u2217 , and is invariant under base change.\nThe theory of limit mixed Hodge structures was developed by many authors including\nDeligne, Katz, Clemens [9], Schmid [33] and Steenbrink [38]. Throughout, we let H m (Y\u221e )\ndenote H m (Ygen ) with the limit mixed Hodge structure, and write\nM\nH p,q (H m (Y\u221e )).\nH m (Y\u221e ) \u223c\n=\np,q\u2264min{m,d}\n\nThe corresponding Hodge and weight filtrations may roughly be described as follows, and we\nrefer the reader to [40, Chapter 7] for details. Firstly, the usual Hodge filtrations F p H m (Yt )\non the non-zero fibers have a limit, in an appropriate sense, when t \u2192 0, called the limit\nHodge filtration. In particular, dim F p H m (Ygen ) = dim F p H m (Y\u221e ). That is,\nX\n(5)\nhp,m\u2212p (Ygen ) =\nhp,q (H m (Y\u221e )),\nq\n\nand hence the limit Hodge numbers {hp,q (H m (Y\u221e ))} refine the usual Hodge numbers of\na general fiber. Secondly, it is a classical result of Ehresmann (see [24] for a proof) that\n\n\f12\n\nERIC KATZ AND ALAN STAPLEDON\n\nf : Y \u2192 D is a locally trivial C \u221e -fibration over D\u2217 . In particular, we may consider the\nmonodromy transformation\nT : H m (Y\u221e ) \u2192 H m (Y\u221e ).\nA classical result of Landman [19] states that T is quasi-unipotent i.e. some multiple of T is\nunipotent. Applying base change to D\u2217 i.e. pulling back the family Y \u2032 \u2192 D\u2217 via the covering\nmap D\u2217 \u2192 D\u2217 , t 7\u2192 tk , has the effect of replacing T by T k . Hence we may and will assume\nthat T is unipotent. In this case, Landman further showed\nthat (T \u2212I)m+1 = 0. By standard\nP\nlinear algebra, the nilpotent operator N = log T = k\u22651 (\u22121)k\u22121 (T \u2212 I)k /k induces a weight\nfiltration on H m (Y\u221e ), called the monodromy weight filtration, which determines and is\ndetermined by the Jordan block decomposition of N. Indeed, we may inductively define a\nunique increasing filtration\n0 \u2286 W0 \u2286 W1 \u2286 * * * \u2286 W2m = H m (Y\u221e ),\nwith associated graded pieces GrkW := Wk /Wk\u22121, satisfying the following properties for any\nnon-negative integer k,\n(1) N(Wk ) \u2286 Wk\u22122,\nW\nW\n(2) the induced map N k : Grm+k\n\u2192 Grm\u2212k\nis an isomorphism.\nFor example, W0 = im N m and W2m\u22121 = ker N m . In fact, the map N : H m (Y\u221e ) \u2192 H m (Y\u221e )\nis a morphism of mixed Hodge structures of type (\u22121, \u22121).\n, then N k+1 = 0\nRemark 4.6. It follows that for k \u2265 0, if H p,m\u2212p(Ygen ) = 0 for all p < m\u2212k\n2\n[29, Corollary 11.42].

In particular, Steenbrink's result implies that the\nmotivic nearby fiber specializes to the limit Hodge-Deligne polynomial [29, Corollary 11.26].\nThat is, under the ring homomorphism E : K0 (VarC ) \u2192 Z[u, v],\n(7)\n\nE(\u03c8f ) = E(Y\u221e ; u, v).\n\n\f13\n\nIn particular, if the central fiber Y0 is a reduced, simple normal crossing divisor with\nirreducible components {Di }i\u2208{1,...,n} , then we conclude that\nX\nE(Y\u221e ) =\nE(DI\u25e6 )(1 \u2212 uv)|I|\u22121.\nI\u2286{1,...,n}\n\nRemark 4.8.

Applications for sch\u00f6n subvarieties of tori\nThe goal of this section is to give a geometric interpretation of the tropical motivic nearby\nfiber of a sch\u00f6n subvariety of a torus, and deduce some Hodge-theoretic and topological\nconsequences.\nWe continue with the notation of Section 2, and let O be the ring of germs of analytic\nfunctions in C in a neighborhood of the origin.

Theorem 3.6). On the other hand, we may fix a disk\nD of sufficiently small radius centered at the origin in C, and consider the generic fiber X\nas a smooth, complex manifold Xan admitting a smooth, proper map f : Xan \u2192 D\u2217 to the\npunctured disk D\u2217 = D r {0}. Let \u03c8f \u2208 K0 (VarC ) be the corresponding motivic nearby fiber\n\u03c8f (cf. Remark 4.5), and let Xgen denote a fixed fiber of f . Observe that the invariants\n\u03c8(X \u25e6 ,\u25b3) and \u03c8f , as well as Xgen , do not depend on P, but only on the associated recession\nfan \u25b3.\nTheorem 5.1. With the notation above, if X \u25e6 \u2286 T is sch\u00f6n and \u25b3 is a unimodular recession\nfan associated to the tropical variety Trop(X \u25e6 ), then \u03c8(X \u25e6 ,\u25b3) = \u03c8f .\nProof.

Limit Hodge structures of hypersurfaces\nThe goal of this section is to explicitly compute the limit mixed Hodge structure of a sch\u00f6n\nfamily of hypersurfaces. We continue with the notation of Section 2, and refer the reader to\n[13] for basic facts on toric varieties.\nAs in Section 5, let O be the ring of germs of analytic functions in C in a neighborhood\nof\nP\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\nu\nthe origin. Let X \u2286 T = Spec K[M] be a sch\u00f6n hypersurface. That is, X = { u\u2208M \u03b1u x =\n0} \u2286 T , for some \u03b1u \u2208 K. The Newton polytope P of X \u25e6 is the convex hull of {u \u2208 M |\n\u03b1u 6= 0}, and the function P \u2229 M \u2192 Z, u 7\u2192 ord \u03b1u , induces a regular, lattice polyhedral\ndecomposition T of P . Explicitly, the faces of T are the projections of the bounded faces\nof the convex hull of {(u, \u03bb) | \u03b1u 6= 0, \u03bb \u2265 ord \u03b1u } in MR \u00d7 R. The tropicalization Trop(X \u25e6 )\nis 'dual' to the polyhedral decomposition T , in the sense that Trop(X \u25e6 ) has a natural\npolyhedral structure such that its faces are in bijection with the positive dimensional faces\nof T (see, for example, [32, Section 3]). The corresponding recession fan of Trop(X \u25e6 ) is\nthe fan obtained from the normal fan of P by removing its maximal cones. We will assume\nthroughout this section that P is (d + 1)-dimensional and that P is almost smooth in\nthe sense that the recession fan of Trop(X \u25e6 ) is unimodular. We remark that if P is not\nalmost smooth, then one can apply Proposition 2.8 to obtain a unimodular refinement of\nthe recession fan.\nAs in Section 5, we may consider the corresponding proper map f : Xan \u2192 D to a disk D of\nsufficiently small radius, which is smooth over the punctured disk D\u2217 . A fixed non-zero fiber\nXgen is a smooth hypersurface of the smooth toric variety YP associated to the recession fan,\nand is sch\u00f6n with respect to the associated complex torus. The central fiber X0 is a disjoint\nunion of locally closed subvarieties {XQ\u25e6 | Q \u2208 T }, each of which is Sch\u00f6n with respect to\nits corresponding complex torus UQ \u223c\n= (C\u2217 )dim Q . If T (i) denotes the set of faces of T whose\nrelative interior lies in the relative interior of a codimension i face of P , then Corollary 5.2\nimplies that\n(9)\n\nE(X\u221e ; u, v) =\n\nd\nX\nX\n\nE(XQ\u25e6 )(1 \u2212 uv)codim Q\u2212i .\n\ni=0 Q\u2208T (i)\n\nThe notion of a sch\u00f6n or non-degenerate hypersurface Z of a torus (C\u2217 )n was introduced\nby Khovanski\u0131\u0306 in [17]. Danilov and Khovanski\u0131\u0306 gave an explicit combinatorial algorithm to\ncompute the Hodge-Deligne polynomial of a non-degenerate hypersurface of a complex torus\n[10]. Later, Batyrev and Borisov produced a combinatorial formula [3, Theorem 3.24], which\nwas simplified by Borisov and Mavlyutov in [7, Proposition 5.5]. The formula is determined\nby the Ehrhart polynomial of the Newton polytope and all its faces (see, for example, [5]),\ntogether with the face poset of the Newton polytope, and is stated explicitly in Theorem A.7.\nIn particular, together with (9), we obtain a combinatorial formula for E(X\u221e ; u, v).\nBy Remark 4.2, the Hodge numbers of Xgen are also determined by this formula, since the\nintersection of Xgen with any toric stratum of YP may be regarded as a non-degenerate hypersurface with Newton polytope a face of P . In particular, the topological Euler characteristic\nof Xgen is given by the formula [10, Remark 4.5]\nX\n(10)\ne(Xgen ) =\n(\u22121)dim Q\u22121 (dim Q)! vol(Q),\nQ\u2286P\n\nwhere vol(Q) denotes the Euclidean volume of a face Q of P with respect to its affine span.\n\n\f17\n\nThe inclusion Xgen \u0592\u2192 YP induces a map on cohomology\nH m (YP ) \u2192 H m (Xgen ),\nwhich, by the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, is an isomorphism for m < d, and injective for\nm = d. Moreover, Poincar\u00e9 duality implies that H m (Xgen ) \u223c\n= H 2d\u2212m (Xgen ). Recall that the\nh-vector {hP,k } of P is defined as the coefficients of the polynomial\nhP (t) =\n\nd+1\nX\n\nhP,k tk =\n\nk=0\n\nX\n\ntd+1\u2212dim Q (1 \u2212 t)dim Q ,\n\nQ\u2286P\n\nwhere the sum runs over all non-empty faces Q of P . The projective toric variety YP has\nno odd cohomology, and dim H 2m (YP ) = hm,m (YP ) = hP,m . By Remark 4.6, we deduce\nthat, for m 6= d, the monodromy operator on dim H m (Xgen ) is trivial, and hence the limit\nmixed Hodge structure coincides with the usual pure Hodge structure. When m = d, the\nsame holds for the image of H d (YP ) in H d (Xgen ). Hence, to describe the limit mixed Hodge\nstructure of X, it remains to describe the limit mixed Hodge structure on\nd\nHprim\n(X\u221e ) := coker[H d (YP ) \u2192 H d (Xgen )].\n\nIt follows that E(X\u221e ; u, v) determines and is determined by the limit Hodge numbers\nhp,q (H m (X\u221e )). That is, we have shown the following.\nCorollary 6.1. With the notation above, there exist explicit combinatorial formulas for the\nlimit Hodge numbers hp,q (H m (X\u221e )).\nRemark 6.2. In general, knowing the limit Hodge numbers hp,q (H m (X\u221e )) of a degeneration\nis strictly more information than knowing the limit Hodge-Deligne polynomial E(X\u221e ).\nWe will now present simpler combinatorial formulas for some of the limit Hodge numbers\nhp,q (H d (X\u221e )). Below, Int(Q) denotes the relative interior of a face Q of P .\nExample 6.3. Recall that Trop(X \u25e6 ) is dual to the polyhedral decomposition T , such that\nan interior edge of T with s interior lattice points corresponds to a maximal, unbounded\nface of Trop(X \u25e6 ) of multiplicity s + 1. It follows that the parametrizing complex \u0393X \u25e6 is\nhomotopic to a wedge of d-spheres, which can be indexed by the lattice points in the interior\nof P which lie on either an edge or a vertex of T .

The Tropical Motivic Nearby Fiber of Matroidal Tropical Varieties\nA matroidal tropical variety is one that is locally described by the matroid fans of Ardila\nand Klivans [1]. They were first introduced by Mikhalkin in [22] who originally called\nthem \"smooth tropical varieties\" but has since renamed them \"effective tropical cycles of\nmultiplicity 1\" in [23]. The name of such tropical varieties will eventually be standardized\nin the literature but we use the matter-of-fact adjective matroidal for the time-being. Some\nevidence for Mikhalkin's original name \"smooth tropical variety\" is provided by Proposition\n7.10.\nMatroids are abstract objects that axiomatize the combinatorics of linear independence.\nA rank d + 1 matroid M on a finite set E = {0, 1, . . . , n} is given by a rank function\nr : 2E \u2192 N \u222a {0} satisfying\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n\nr(I) \u2264 |I|,\nI \u2286 J implies r(I) \u2264 r(J),\nr(I \u222a J) + r(I \u2229 J) \u2264 r(I) + r(J),\nr(E) = d + 1.\n\nA flat of M is a subset I \u2286 E such that for all j \u2208 E r I, r(I \u222a {j}) > r(I). They\nform a lattice under the partial order of inclusion. One may associate such a matroid to a\nd-dimensional linear subspace X of Pn . For I \u2282 E, let HI be the coordinate subspace given\nby \u2229i\u2208I {Xi = 0}, and set r(I) = d \u2212 dim(X \u2229 HI ) (where we use the convention that the\ndimension of the empty set is \u22121). I is a flat of M if and only if the linear space X \u2229 HI\nis not equal to X \u2229 HJ for any J \u2283 I. Equivalently, if we define HI\u2217 to be the subset of HI\ngiven by Xj 6= 0 for j 6\u2208 I, I is a flat of M if and only if X intersects HI\u2217 .\nThe matroid M can be encoded in a simplicial fan called the matroid fan \u2206M . Let N be\nthe lattice\nN = ZE /he0 + * * * + en i.\n\n\f20\n\nERIC KATZ AND ALAN STAPLEDON\n\n\u2206M will be a fan in NR . For a subset I \u2282 E, let eI be the vector\nX\neI =\nei\ni\u2208I\n\nin NR . The rays of the matroid fan \u2206M are \u03c1L = R+ eL for proper flats L ( E of the\nmatroid. More generally, the k-dimensional cones of the matroid fan correspond to the kstep flags of proper flats: if F is a flag of flats L1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Lk then the corresponding cone\nis \u03c3F = Span+ ({eL1 , . . . , eLk }). Because every flag of flats in a matroid can be extended to\na full flag, the matroid fan \u2206M is of pure dimension d. Each top-dimensional cone of \u2206M is\ngiven multiplicity 1. Ardila and Klivans introduced this fan as the fine subdivision of the\nBergman fan of a matroid.\nThe tropicalization of a hyperplane arrangement complement X \u25e6 defined over C is a fan\nof the form \u2206M . In fact, let X \u2282 Pn be a d-dimensional linear space and set X \u25e6 = X \u2229 (C\u2217 )n .\nLet M be the matroid on E = {0, 1, . . . , n} associated to X. Then, Trop(X \u25e6 ) = \u2206M .\nExample 7.1. Let M be a rank 2 matroid on E = {0, 1, . . . , n}. Let I1 , . . . , Is be the set\nof of rank 1 flats. \u2206M is the union of the rays {\u03c1Ik }1\u2264k\u2264s . In the special case that every\nelement of I is a rank 1 flat, \u2206M is the union of \u03c10 , . . . , \u03c1n which is the 1-skeleton of the fan\ncorresponding to Pn . This is the tropicalization of a generic line in Pn which intersects each\ncoordinate hyperplane in a generic point.\nMoreover, if a matroid fan is the tropicalization of a variety, the variety must be a hyperplane arrangement complement.\nProposition 7.2. [18, Proposition 4.2] Let X \u25e6 \u2282 (C\u2217 )n be a subvariety. Suppose that\n| Trop(X \u25e6 )| = |\u2206M | and each top-dimensional cell of Trop(X \u25e6 ) has multiplicity 1. Then the\nclosure of X \u25e6 in PnC is a d-dimensional linear subspace whose matroid is M.\nThe matroid M can be recovered from the underlying set |\u2206M |. For I \u2282 E, let \u03c4I =\nSpan+ ({ei |i \u2208 I}). The set of all \u03c4I form the fan \u2206 corresponding to the toric variety Pn .\nNote that each open cone of \u2206M is contained in a unique open cone in \u2206. In fact, \u03c3F \u2282 \u03c4Lk .\nLemma 7.3. Let I \u2282 E. I is a proper flat of M if and only if |\u2206M | \u2229 \u03c4I\u25e6 6= \u2205. In that case,\nr(I) is equal to the dimension of the tangent space of a smooth point of |\u2206M | \u2229 \u03c4I\u25e6 .\nProof. Suppose I is a flat of M, then \u03c1I is a ray in \u2206M and is contained in \u03c4I\u25e6 .\nNow suppose \u2206M \u2229\u03c4I\u25e6 6= \u2205. Then there is an open cone \u03c3F contained in the relative interior\nof \u03c4I . If F = {L1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Lk } then Lk = I and I is a flat of M. Now, \u03c3F\u25e6 is a maximal cone\nof \u2206M \u2229 \u03c4I\u25e6 if and only if F is a saturated flag. Consequently, dim(\u03c3F ) = r(I). In that case,\nthe linear span of \u03c3F is equal to the tangent space of a point in its relative interior.\n\u0003\nLet PM be the poset of flats of M under inclusion where b\n0 = \u2205 is the unique minimal element\nand b\n1 = {0, 1, . . . , n}. Then by Theorem 1 of [1], \u2206M \u2229 S n\u22121 is a geometric realization of\nthe order complex of the poset \u2206(PM r {b\n0, b\n1}). Consequently, \u03bc(b\n0, b\n1) = \u03c7\ne(|\u2206M | \u2229 S n\u22121 ) by\nProposition 3.8.6 of [36]. One may recover the M\u00f6bius function of PM from \u2206M .\n\nLemma 7.4. Let I be a flat of M of positive rank. Let K be the set of cones of \u2206M that\nintersect \u03c4I\u25e6 in \u03c1I ordered under inclusion. Let \u03c3I\u2032 be a maximal cone in K. Then\n\u03bc(b\n0, I) = \u03c7\ne(lk\u03c3I\u2032 (\u2206M )).\n\n\f21\n\nProof. Each cone in \u2206M that intersects \u03c4I\u25e6 in \u03c1I is of the form \u03c3I\u2032 = \u03c3F for F a flag of flats\n{L1 = I \u2282 * * * \u2282 Lk }. For the cone \u03c3F to be maximal of that type, it must correspond\nto a saturated flag of flats. A cone \u03c3F \u2032 contains \u03c3F in its closure if and only if F is the\nterminal segment of F \u2032. It follows that lk\u03c3I\u2032 (\u2206M ) is a geometric realization of the order\ncomplex \u2206((PM )I r {b\n0, I}), where (PM )I is the principal order ideal (PM )I = {J|J \u2286 I}.\nThe conclusion follows form Proposition 3.8.6 of [36].\n\u0003\n\nWe can use the above lemma in combination with \u03bc(b\n0, b\n0) = 1 to determine all values of\n\u03bc(b\n0, I). Note that if I is a rank 1 flat, then \u03bc(b\n0, I) = \u03c7\ne(\u2205) = \u22121. The M\u00f6bius function can be\nread from the geometry of |\u2206M | once we have chosen \u03c3I\u2032 since lk\u03c3I\u2032 (\u2206M ) = \u03c0I\u2032 (Star\u2206M (\u03c3I\u2032 )) \u2229\nS(N/N\u03c3I\u2032 ), where \u03c0I\u2032 : N \u2192 N/N\u03c3I\u2032 and S(N/N\u03c3I\u2032 ) is the unit sphere in N/N\u03c3I\u2032 .\nRecall that the characteristic polynomial of M is given by\nX\n\u03bc(b\n0, I)q d\u2212r(I) .\n\u03c7M (q) =\nI\u2208PM\n\nConsequently,\n\n\u03c7M (q) = 1 \u2212\n\nX\n\nq+\n\nr(I)=1\n\nX\n\nr(I)\u22652\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03c7\ne(lk\u03c3I\u2032 (\u2206M ))q d\u2212dim(\u03c3I ) .\n\nWe have to make use of the projective motivic version of Theorem 5.2 of [27].\nLemma 7.5. The class of [X \u25e6 ] in K0 (VarC ) is given by\n[X \u25e6 ] =\n\nL\u03c7M (L) \u2212 \u03c7M (1)\n.\nL\u22121\n\nProof. From [An ] = Ln , we have\nE(Pn ) = 1 + L + * * * + Ln =\n\nLn+1 \u2212 1\n.\nL\u22121\n\nP\nSince X \u25e6 is expressed motivically as I\u2208PM \u03bc(b\n0, I)[X \u2229 HI ],\nX\n(L \u2212 1)[X \u25e6 ] =\n\u03bc(b\n0, I)((L)d\u2212r(I)+1 \u2212 1) = L\u03c7M (L) \u2212 \u03c7M (1).\nI\u2208PM\n\n\u0003\n\nExample 7.6. Let us consider a rank 2 matroid on E = {0, 1, . . . , n}. Let I1 , . . . , Is be its\nrank 1 flats. By Lemma 7.4, we know\nConsequently,\n\n\u03bc(b\n0, b\n0) = 1, \u03bc(b\n0, Ik ) = \u22121.\n\u03c7M (q) = q \u2212 s.\n\nIt follows that\n[X \u25e6 ] =\n\nL(L \u2212 s) \u2212 (1 \u2212 s)\n=L\u2212s+1\nL\u22121\n\nAlternatively, we know that \u2206M is the tropicalization of the complement of s points in P1 .\nIt follows that [X \u25e6 ] = L \u2212 s + 1.\nWe now globalize the notion to tropical varieties that locally look like matroid fans.\n\n\f22\n\nERIC KATZ AND ALAN STAPLEDON\n\nDefinition 7.7. A tropicalization Trop(X \u25e6 ) is said to be matroidal with respect to a rational\npolyhedral structure \u03a3 on Trop(X \u25e6 ) if\n(1) Every top-dimensional cell of Trop(X \u25e6 ) has multiplicity 1.\n(2) For every face F of Trop(X \u25e6 ), the star quotient StarTrop(X \u25e6 ) (F )/NF has the same\nunderlying set as some matroid fan \u2206MF for some choice of integral basis e1 , . . . , el\nof N/NF .\nDefinition 7.8. A tropicalization Trop(X \u25e6 ) is said to be matroidal if it is matroidal with\nrespect to some \u03a3.\nNote that we have e0 = \u2212e1 \u2212 * * * \u2212 el in N/NF . We do not require the choice of e0 , . . . , el\nto be global so MF is not necessarily uniquely defined. Nor do we require that there is\na polyhedral structure on Trop(X \u25e6 ) inducing the matroid fan structure on the stars of\ncells. This is done by Allermann [2] in developing intersection theory on matroidal tropical\nvarieties. His definition is also different form ours because his tropical varieties are locally\nmodeled on the uniform matroid. Because our results are independent of the polyhedral\nstructure on Trop(X \u25e6 ) we do not require this. However, to get finer data about X from\nTrop(X \u25e6 ), doing so may be necessary. Examples of matroidal tropical varieties include planar\ntrivalent curves all of whose vertices have multiplicity 1 (in the sense of [21, Definition 2.16])\nand tropical hypersurfaces corresponding to a Newton subdivision all of whose cells are\nunimodular simplices.\nLemma 7.9. Suppose Trop(X \u25e6 ) is matroidal with respect to \u03a3. If \u03a3\u2032 is a refinement of \u03a3,\nthen Trop(X \u25e6 ) is matroidal with respect to \u03a3\u2032 .\nProof. Let F \u2032 be a cell in \u03a3\u2032 whose relative interior is contained in the relative interior of a\ncell F of \u03a3. Then, StarTrop(X \u25e6 ) (F \u2032 ) = StarTrop(X \u25e6 ) (F ) and\n\u0001\nStarTrop(X \u25e6 ) (F )/(NF )R = StarTrop(X \u25e6 ) (F \u2032 )/(NF \u2032 )R / ((NF /NF\u2032 )R ) .\nSuppose that M is the matroid fan of {0, . . . , n \u2212 dim(F )} associated to the above fan with\nrespect to a basis e1 , . . . , en\u2212dim(F ) . Consider the short exact sequence of lattices\n0 \u2192 NF /NF \u2032 \u2192 N/NF \u2032 \u2192 N/NF \u2192 0.\nPick a splitting j : N/NF \u2192 N/NF \u2032 and let e\u20321 , . . . , e\u2032n\u2212dim(F ) be the image of the basis\nunder this splitting. Set l = dim(F ) \u2212 dim(F \u2032 ), and let f1 , . . . , fl be a basis for NF /NF \u2032 .\nLet G1 , . . . , Gl be copies of the unique rank 1 matroid on 1 element, and define M\u2032 be the\nmatroid on n \u2212 dim(F \u2032 ) + 1 elements given by\nM\u2032 = M \u2294 G1 \u2294 * * * \u2294 Gl .\nIt is straightforward to verify that the underlying set of \u2206M\u2032 with respect to the basis\n{e\u20321 , . . . , e\u2032n\u2212dim(F ) , f1 , . . . , fl } is\njR (|\u2206M |) + (NF /NF \u2032 )R = StarTrop(X \u25e6 ) (F \u2032 )/(NF \u2032 )R .\n\u0003\nProposition 7.10. If Trop(X \u25e6 ) is a matroidal tropical variety, then X \u25e6 is sch\u00f6n. Consequently, X \u25e6 is smooth.\n\n\f23\n\nProof. We first show that every initial degeneration of X \u25e6 is smooth. If w \u2208 Trop(X \u25e6 ) is\nthe relative interior of a cell F of \u03a3, StarTrop(X \u25e6 ) (F )/(NF )R is a matroid fan. Now inw X \u25e6 is\nTF -invariant and we have\n| Trop(inw X \u25e6 /TF )| = | Trop(inw X \u25e6 )|/(NF )R = StarTrop(X \u25e6 ) (F )/(NF )R .\nBy Proposition 7.2, (inw X \u25e6 )/TF is a hyperplane complement and inw X \u25e6 is smooth. It follows\nfrom Proposition 2.7 that X is sch\u00f6n. Consequently, by Lemma 2.9, X \u25e6 is smooth.\n\u0003\nMatroidal tropical varieties may therefore be thought of as having a very strong form\nof classical smoothness. In general, even if X \u25e6 is smooth there may be singular X \u2032 \u25e6 with\nTrop(X \u25e6 ) = Trop(X \u2032 \u25e6 ). A matroidal tropical variety, however, has no singular lift. One\ncould think in analogy with tropical general position of points: every classical lift of a set of\ntropical points in general position is in general position.\nSince X \u25e6 is sch\u00f6n, by Proposition 2.6, (X, P(\u03a3)) is a tropical pair for any choice of rational\npolyhedral structure \u03a3 on Trop(X \u25e6 ). For matroidal tropical varieties, there is no difference\nbetween the parameterizing complex \u0393X \u25e6 and Trop(X \u25e6 ):\nLemma 7.11. Let Trop(X \u25e6 ) be a matroidal tropical variety. Then the natural parameterizing\nmap p : \u0393X \u25e6 \u2192 Trop(X \u25e6 ) is a homeomorphism.\nProof. Let P be a toric scheme such that (X \u25e6 , P) is a normal crossings pair. Put the polyhedral structure on Trop(X \u25e6 ) induced from \u03a3. Each cell of \u0393(X \u25e6 ,P) is of the form (F, Y ) where\nF is a cell of Trop(X \u25e6 ) and Y is a component of XF\u25e6 . Since each XF\u25e6 is a linear space, it\nfollows that there is only one cell of \u0393(X \u25e6 ,P) lying above each cell of Trop(X \u25e6 ). Consequently,\np is an isomorphism of polyhedral complexes, and hence a homeomorphism.\n\u0003\nNow, \u03c7MF (q) can reconstructed from the geometry of | Trop(X \u25e6 )| by looking at the star\nquotient of F and applying the methods above.\nBy Lemma 7.5, we have the following:\nCorollary 7.12.

Then X corresponds to a family of curves degenerating\nto a union of rational curves. Each vertex v of \u03a3 contributes (L \u2212 E(v) + 1) to the tropical\nmotivic nearby fiber where E(v) is the number of edges containing v. Each bounded edge\ncontributes \u2212L+1 while each unbounded edge contributes 1. Let V, B, U denotes the number\nof vertices, bounded edges, and unbounded edges, respectively. Then,\n!\nX\n\u03c8(X \u25e6, \u25b3) =\n(L \u2212 E(v) + 1) + B(\u2212L + 1) + U = L(v \u2212 B) + (v \u2212 B) = (L + 1)\u03c7(\u03a3).\nv\n\nSpecializing to L = 1, we get e(Xgen ) = 2\u03c7(\u03a3), and hence Xgen is a smooth curve of genus\nh1 (\u03a3).\n8. Open problems\nWe briefly mention some open problems and directions for further research.\n\n(1) Can one give a geometric interpretation of the tropical motivic nearby fiber \u03c8(X \u25e6 ,\u25b3)\nwhen (X \u25e6 , P) is a tropical pair, but X \u25e6 is not necessarily sch\u00f6n? What about its\nevaluation e(\u03c8(X \u25e6 ,\u25b3) ) under the specialization K0 (VarC ) \u2192 Z which takes the class\nof a variety V to its Euler characteristic e(V )?\n(2) To what extent can one relax the condition of 'smoothness' and replace it with 'orbifold singularities' ? More specifically, can one associate a limit mixed Hodge structure\nto a family f : X \u2192 D\u2217 over the punctured disk in which the fibers have at worst\norbifold singularities? Can one compute a 'motivic nearby fiber' given a semi-stable\ndegeneration in which the central fiber is reduced and has 'orbifold normal crossings' ?\n(3) When Trop(X \u25e6 ) is matroidal, can one use Proposition 7.2 to explicitly write down\nall terms and maps in the corresponding Steenbrink spectral sequence [38, Corollary 4.20], and hence deduce a reasonable combinatorial formula for the corresponding limit mixed Hodge numbers? Can one give interesting examples of matroidal\ntropical varieties which are not curves or hypersurfaces?\n(4) What is the combinatorial significance of property (2) of the logarithm N of the\nmonodromy map when X \u25e6 is a sch\u00f6n hypersurface? That is, what is the significance\nof the fact that the sequences {hp+i,i (H d\u22121 (X\u221e )) | 0 \u2264 i \u2264 d \u2212 1 \u2212 p} are symmetric\nand unimodal for 0 \u2264 p \u2264 d \u2212 1?\nAppendix A. The Hodge-Deligne polynomial of a non-degenerate\nhypersurface of a torus\nThe goal of this section is to state a formula for the Hodge-Deligne polynomial of a\nnon-degenerate hypersurface Z of a torus with Newton polytope P , as it appears in [7].\nThroughout, P is a (d + 1)-dimensional lattice polytope in a lattice M.\n\n\f25\n\nIf B is a finite poset, then the M\u00f6bius function \u03bcB : B \u00d7 B \u2192 Z\nfollows,\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 1\n0\n\u03bcB (x, y) =\nP\n\uf8f3 \u2212P\nx<z\u2264y \u03bcB (z, y) = \u2212\nx\u2264z<y \u03bcB (x, z)\n\nis defined recursively as\nif x = y\nif x > y .\nif x < y\n\nFor any pair z \u2264 x in B, we can consider the interval [z, x] = {y \u2208 B | z \u2264 y \u2264 x}. Suppose\nthat B has a minimal element 0 and a maximal element 1, and that every maximal chain\nin B has the same length. The rank \u03c1(x) of an element x in B is equal to the length of a\nmaximal chain in [0, x], and the rank of B is \u03c1(1). In this case, we say that B is Eulerian if\n\u03bcB (x, y) = (\u22121)\u03c1(x)\u2212\u03c1(y) for x \u2264 y.\nRemark A.1. Alternatively, one verifies that B is Eulerian if and only if every interval of\nnon-zero length contains as many elements of even rank as odd rank.\nExample A.2. The poset of faces of a polytope P (including the empty face) is an Eulerian\nposet under inclusion. If we consider the empty face to have dimension \u22121, then \u03c1(Q) =\ndim Q + 1, for any face Q of P .\nExample A.3. The Boolean algebra on r elements consists of all subsets of a set of cardinality r and forms an Eulerian poset under inclusion.\nThe G-polynomial of an Eulerian poset was introduced by Stanley.\nDefinition A.4. [37] If B is an Eulerian poset of rank n, then\n\u001a\n1\nP\nG(B, t) =\n\u2212\u03c4<n/2 ( 0<x\u22641 (t \u2212 1)\u03c1(x) G([x, 1], t))\n\nif n = 0\n,\nif n > 0\n\nwhere \u03c4<n/2 is the truncation map which takes a polynomial and associates all the terms of\ndegree less than n/2.\n\nExample A.5. If B is the Boolean algebra on r elements, then one verifies that G(B, t) = 1.\nIf Q is a face of P , then recall that the Ehrhart polynomial fQ (m) of Q is defined by\nfQ (m) = #(mQ \u2229 M), for each positive integer m, and its generating series has the form\nX\n\nfQ (m)tm =\n\nm\u22650\n\nh\u2217Q (t)\n,\n(1 \u2212 t)dim Q+1\n\nwhere h\u2217Q (t) is a polynomial of degree at most dim Q with non-negative integer coefficients\n(see, for example, [5]). If Q is the empty face of P , then we set h\u2217Q (t) = 1.\nDefinition A.6. [7] If Q is a (possibly empty) face of P , then\nX\n\u2032\ne\n(\u22121)dim Q\u2212dim Q h\u2217Q\u2032 (t)G([Q\u2032 , Q], t).\nS(Q,\nt) =\nQ\u2032 \u2286Q\n\nWe can now present Batyrev and Borisov's formula for E(Z; u, v) as stated in [7]. We\nremark that an alternative formula was earlier obtained by Khovanski\u0131\u0306 in unpublished work.\nIf B is an Eulerian poset, then let B \u2217 denote the Eulerian poset with all orderings between\nelements reversed.\n\n\f26\n\nERIC KATZ AND ALAN STAPLEDON\n\nTheorem A.7. [3, 7] If Z is a non-degenerate hypersurface with respect to a lattice polytope\nP of dimension d + 1, then\nX\ne\nE(Z; u, v) = (1/uv)[(uv \u2212 1)d+1 + (\u22121)d\nudim Q+1 S(Q,\nu\u22121 v)G([Q, P ]\u2217 , uv)].\nQ\u2286P\n\nReferences\n1.
