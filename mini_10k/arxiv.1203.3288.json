I NTRODUCTION\nTATISTICAL properties of products of Random Variables\n(RVs) are essential in performance analysis of contemporary wireless communication systems. For example, the fading\namplitude of multi-hop relaying systems follows the distribution of the product of Nakagami-m RVs [1]. In addition, the\ncascaded-keyhole channel can be modeled using the product\nof individual keyhole channels [2].\nThe exact Probability Density Function (PDF) and Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the product of independent\nBeta, Gamma and Gaussian RVs can be represented in terms\nof the Meijer-G function [3]. A more general framework\ninvolving the Fox H-function was proposed in [4] for the\ndistribution of product of almost any non-negative independent\nRVs. Although being theoretically interesting, these G- or Hfunction representations are difficult to evaluate on a lowcomplexity computing platform, where the calculation of the\nproduct statistics is required [5]. The numerical calculations\nof G- and H-functions require a numerical solution of contour\nintegrals or a construction of look-up tables that cover all\nparameter combinations. Both approaches set stringent requirements for the considered platform either in the computing\ncapability or the memory capacity. Recently, Ahmed et al. [6]\nemployed the Mellin transform and the residue theorem to\nderive the PDF of a product of i.i.d. Nakagami-m RVs as\nan infinite series. By exploiting the structure of the Mellin\ntransforms, the authors in [7], [8] proposed approximations\nto the PDFs and CDFs of products of independent Rayleigh,\n\nS\n\nThe authors are with the Department of Communications and Networking, Aalto University, 00076 Aalto, Finland (e-mail: {zhong.zheng, lu.wei,\njyri.hamalainen, olav.tirkkonen}@aalto.fi).

However, when the\nRVs in product are correlated, exact distributions are known\nonly in some special cases (e.g. bivariate Nakagami-m in [9]).\nFor arbitrary number of RVs with generic correlations, none\nof the aforementioned methodologies are suitable to give a\ntractable solution. This is the main issue to be addressed in\nthis paper.\nMotivated by the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), the approximation for the product of RVs can be constructed by using a\nlognormal density and its associated orthogonal polynomials.\nWe apply the approach of [10] where the first few moments\nof the product and the approximated density function are set\nequal. The resulting approximative distribution involves only\na finite sum of polynomials and the elementary lognormal\ndensity function. Therefore, implementing the proposed expressions on practical computing platforms is straightforward\ncompared with the G- or H-function representations. We note\nthat the proposed framework is suitable for cases of both\nindependent and correlated variables provided that moments\nof a product can be computed in closed-form.\nIn this paper we deduce a closed-form expression for the\northogonal polynomials associated with a general lognormal\ndensity. The result is obtained by taking advantage of the\ndeterminant representation of orthogonal polynomials. To give\na specific example, we derive an approximative PDF and\nCDF for the product of both independent and correlated\nNakagami-m RVs. Numerical results are compared with simulations in terms of the Complementary CDF (CCDF). The\noverall approximation accuracy is measured by the Mean\nSquare Error (MSE) between the approximative CDF and the\nempirical CDF. The orthogonal polynomials associated with\na standard lognormal density1 were first developed in [11],\nwhich is a special case of our result. It is worth of noticing\nthat our results are not straightforward extensions of the results\npresented in [11] but require new methodological elements.\nII.

A PPROXIMATION TO THE D ENSITY OF P RODUCT\nNAKAGAMI -m R ANDOM VARIABLES\n\nOF\n\nA. General Framework\nAccording to the CLT, the distribution of a product of\nRVs can be approximated by a lognormal distribution when\nthe number of RVs is large. Motivated by this, we choose\nfLN (x) as an initial approximation for the distribution of a\nproduct of RVs in the context of the moment based density\napproximation, which is derived in [10]. Let M (k) denote the\nk-th moment of a density function f (x), the approximation to\nf (x) reads\nN\nX\n\u03b7i \u03c0i (x),\n(11)\nf (x) \u2243 fLN (x)\ni=0\n\nPi\n\nwhere the constant \u03b7i = h1i k=0 ci,k M (k). Note that the first\nN moments of the approximation (11) are matched with the\ncorresponding moments of f (x) [10].\nAlternatively, (11) can be rearranged by combining the\ncoefficients of \u03c0iP\n(x) with the same power\nx, resulting in\nPof\nN\nN\nf (x) \u2243 fLN (x) i=0 \u03bei xi where \u03bej =\nk=j ck,j \u03b7k . After\ndirect integration the approximated CDF attains the form\n\u0013\n\u0012\nN\nX\nlog(x) \u2212 \u03bc\n\u2212 i\u03c3 ,\n(12)\n\u03bei \u03bdi \u03a6\nF (x) \u2243\n\u03c3\ni=0\nwhere \u03a6(*) is the CDF of a standard normal RV. The CCDF\nF\u0304 (x) = 1 \u2212 F (x) is approximated by replacing F (x) with the\nexpression (12).\nIt is a typical situation that the moments of certain RV\nare relatively easy to obtain whereas its exact distribution\nis difficult to calculate or unavailable [13]. The proposed\napproximations (11) and (12) are particularly useful in this\nsituation, as will be shown in the next subsection.\nB. Moment Based Approximation to Distribution of Product\nof Nakagami-m RVs\nQK\nLet RV P = i=1 Ri be a product of K Nakagami-m RVs\neach with the PDF\n\u0013\n\u0012\ni 2mi \u22121\nmi 2\n2mm\ni x\n, x \u2208 (0, \u221e).

In the literature, there exists different\nrepresentations for the joint PDF of multivariate Nakagami-m\nRVs, which are either limited in parameter values or crosscorrelation structures. In this paper, we adopt a recent result\nderived in [14], which gives the joint PDF as a single integral.\nIn the proposed approach, the RVs Ri are assumed to have\nthe same fading parameter m and the joint PDF is valid\n\n\f3\n\nfor integer and half-integer values of m. The power crosscorrelation coefficient between Ri2 and Rj2 is of the form\n(14)\n\n\u22121\n\nNote that the derived approximation framework is not limited\nby the above multivariate model.\nBased on the joint PDF [14, eq.

Solid lines: approximative PDFs; markers:\nsimulated PDFs.\n\nIV. N UMERICAL R ESULTS\nIn Fig. 1, we compare simulations with the approximative\nCCDFs for the product of six Nakagami-m RVs with parameters m = 1, 4 and \u03a9 = 1, using orthogonal polynomials of up to 16-th degree. Here we consider equal crosscorrelations, i.e. \u03c1R2i ,R2j = \u03c1 (i 6= j), and calculate the\nparameters of the approximation using (15), (16) and (17)\nwith \u03c1 = 0.1, 0.5 and 0.8 for correlated Nakagami-m RVs.\nIn case of independent RVs (with \u03c1 = 0), equations (18), (16)\nand (19) are applied. When m = 1 the RVs Ri are Rayleigh\ndistributed, while with m = 4 the Ri are approximately Rician\ndistributed with the Rician \u03ba-factor given by \u03ba = 6.46 [5]. For\neach simulated CCDF curve, we generate 106 realizations of\nthe Nakagami-m RVs Ri (i = 1, * * * , 6) using Sim's method\n[16]. As a comparison, we also plot the approximative CCDFs\ncalculated from [8, eq. (36)] for the cases with independent\nNakagami-m RVs. Fig. 1(b) shows that differences between\nthe approximative CCDFs and simulations are less than 10\u22123\nwhen \u03c1 = 0 and 0.1, and less than 10\u22122 when \u03c1 = 0.5. In\naddition, when m = 4 and \u03c1 = 0, the proposed approximation\nyields improved accuracy compared with the results given\nin [8]. However, as m = 1, the approximations with the\nsame correlation coefficients are noticeably inaccurate due to\nslow convergence of the series in (12). Note that in both\ncases the approximative CCDFs with \u03c1 = 0.8 deviate from\nthe simulations since the CLT fails under high correlation\ncondition.\nR\u221e \u2217\nTable I summarizes the MSE \u01eb2 =\n0 |F (x) \u2212\nF (x)|2 dF (x) between the approximation F (x) and the empirical distribution function F \u2217 (x) of the product P as a function\nof the number of RVs K. When K is small (K \u2264 10),\nTable I shows that the approximated CDF achieves considerably smaller MSE in low-correlation cases (\u03c1 = 0.1 and 0.5)\ncompared with the independent case (\u03c1 = 0). As K increases,\nthe accuracy for the independent case becomes superior to\nthose of correlated ones. When m = 4, all approximations\nare much more accurate compared with the corresponding\nRayleigh cases (m = 1), and the MSEs \u01eb2 , except for those\n\n\f4\n\nTABLE I\nM EAN SQUARE ERROR \u01eb2\n\nm = 1,\nm = 1,\nm = 1,\nm = 1,\nm = 4,\nm = 4,\nm = 4,\nm = 4,\n\nK\n\u03c1=0\n\u03c1 = 0.1\n\u03c1 = 0.5\n\u03c1 = 0.8\n\u03c1=0\n\u03c1 = 0.1\n\u03c1 = 0.5\n\u03c1 = 0.8\n\n2\n1.14e-3\n1.06e-3\n9.99e-4\n2.17e-3\n8.13e-6\n8.31e-6\n7.03e-6\n3.58e-5\n\n4\n1.09e-3\n5.00e-4\n1.68e-4\n9.16e-4\n2.29e-5\n1.16e-5\n1.34e-5\n3.20e-4\n\n6\n6.28e-4\n1.05e-4\n2.10e-5\n7.72e-4\n2.43e-5\n2.65e-6\n7.44e-6\n4.63e-4\n\nOF APPROXIMATIVE DISTRIBUTION\n\n8\n3.78e-4\n1.66e-5\n9.54e-5\n7.41e-4\n1.64e-5\n2.33e-6\n9.73e-6\n3.03e-4\n\nwhere K > 16 and \u03c1 = 0.1, is less than 10\u22124 in case of\nindependent RVs or when correlation is low.\nAlthough the accuracies of the approximations (11) and (12)\nshould be improved as N increases, analysis of the exact\nimprovement is difficult due to the multiple nested finite\nsummations involved.

C ONCLUSION\nKnowledge of the distributions of product of random variables is important for understanding the performance of various communication systems. In this work, we first derived a\nclosed-form expression for the orthogonal polynomials associated with general lognormal density. The derived result was\nsubsequently applied in approximating the distribution of the\nproduct of random variables. As an example, we calculated\nclosed-form approximations for the distributions of product\nof Nakagami-m variates. Under light fading conditions, the\nresulting expressions achieve a good trade-off between computation complexity and approximation accuracy for small\ncross-correlations. It is still an open problem to find a closedform (approximated) distribution for the product of correlated\nNakagami-m RVs under deep fading condition.\nA PPENDIX\nWe note that the determinant\n\u2206n,k = e(i+j)\u03bc+\n\n(i+j)2\n2\n\n\u03c32\n\n(20)\ni=0,*** ,n\u22121; j=0,*** ,n; j6=k\n2\n\n2\n\nremains unchanged by factoring out the term ei\u03bc+i \u03c3 /2 from\n2 2\nthe i-th row and the term ej\u03bc+j \u03c3 /2 from the j-th column.\nNamely, we have\n\u03bdn ij\u03c32\ne\n\u03bdk\ni=0,*** ,n\u22121; j=0,*** ,n; j6=k\nQn\u22121 Qn\n\u03bdn i=0 j=i+1 (q j \u2212 q i )\n,\n= E(n) Qn\nQk\u22121\n\u03bdk j=k+1 (q j \u2212 q k ) i=0 (q k \u2212 q i )\n\n\u2206n,k = E(n)\n\n\u03c32\n\n2\n\n(21)\n(22)\n\nwhere E(n) = en(n\u22121)\u03bc+ 6 n(2n \u22123n+1) and the second\n2\nequality follows from the fact that eij\u03c3 is a Vandermonde\ndeterminant.\n\n10\n2.72e-4\n1.73e-5\n2.07e-4\n7.28e-4\n2.24e-5\n1.77e-5\n1.74e-5\n2.27e-4\n\n12\n2.02e-4\n5.35e-5\n3.18e-4\n7.21e-4\n3.15e-5\n4.95e-5\n2.48e-5\n2.12e-4\n\n14\n1.67e-4\n1.03e-4\n4.16e-4\n7.09e-4\n4.34e-5\n8.93e-5\n3.36e-5\n2.09e-4\n\n16\n1.45e-4\n1.72e-4\n5.36e-4\n7.15e-4\n4.78e-5\n1.15e-4\n4.21e-5\n2.11e-4\n\n18\n1.28e-4\n2.40e-4\n6.24e-4\n7.13e-4\n5.14e-5\n1.31e-4\n4.99e-5\n2.09e-4\n\n20\n1.14e-4\n3.21e-4\n6.98e-4\n7.16e-4\n5.02e-5\n1.47e-4\n5.49e-5\n2.06e-4\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work was supported in part by the Academy of Finland\n(grant 133562) and in part by the Finnish Funding Agency for\nTechnology and Innovation (TEKES).\nR EFERENCES\n[1] G.
