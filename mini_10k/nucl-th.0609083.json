Indeed lattice QCD calculation predict that the properties of strongly interacting matter change drastically at\na temperature about Tc \u2248 170MeV above which chiral\nsymmetry is restored and quarks and gluons are deconfined. These calculations also indicate that this transition\nis (at zero net baryon density) a rapid crossover from the\nlow-temperature hadron dominated phase into the hightemperature plasma phase. For a review, see e.g. [5].\nA gradual restoration of chiral symmetry should also\nlead to modifications in the hadronic sector (at high densities and temperatures), since chiral partners become degenerate once chiral symmetry is fully restored. Chiral\nsymmetry especially dictates a relationship between the\nSend offprint requests to:\n\nvector and axial-vector channels [6,7]. This is important\nfor the dilepton production in a medium since the vector\ncorrelator dominates the electromagnetic spectral function. Therefore it is expected that chiral symmetry restoration should manifest itself in modifications of the properties of the \u03c1, \u03c9 and \u03c6 which leave its trace in the measured\ndilepton spectra.\nBrown and Rho proposed that chiral symmetry restoration should primarily be reflected in a scaling of the masses\nof the vector mesons in a nuclear medium with the quark\ncondensate [8,9,10,11]. This would cause the maximum of\nthe \u03c1-meson spectral function to be shifted to lower masses\nin a hot and dense nuclear medium and thus would lead\nto an enhancement of the lepton pairs produced at lower\ninvariant masses as compared to the vacuum.\nWe also mention that Brown-Rho scaling is not the\nonly conjecture that indicates substantial mass shifts. A\ndifferent approach is based on the assumption that the\nlower-mass meson multiplets should be the relevant degrees of freedom near the phase boundary. Pisarski proposed to study a gauged linear \u03c3-model to gain insight\ninto vector meson modifications at finite temperature [12,\n13,14]. He found in a finite temperature mean-field calculation assuming vector meson dominance that the \u03c1meson and a1 -meson masses become degenerate at Tc resulting in m\u03c1 = ma1 = 962 MeV. This result is sensitive\nto the vector-meson dominance conjecture, since a situation where vector meson dominance does not hold leads\nto slightly decreasing masses close to the phase transition\nTc , namely m\u03c1 = ma1 = 629 MeV.\n\n\f2\n\nJ. Ruppert, T. Renk: What does the \u03c1-meson do? In-medium mass shift scenarios versus hadronic model calculations\n\nAn alternative picture to these scenarios, based on\nbroadening of the \u03c1-meson without a substantial mass\nshift of the \u03c1-meson due to interactions with the surrounding thermal medium was suggested by the study of effective Lagrangians in hadronic model calculations (see e.g.\n[15,16,17]). These findings are also supported by calculations of the spectral function as inferred from experiment\nby constructing scattering amplitudes for vector mesons\nscattering from pions and nucleons [18,19]. This substantial broadening without strong mass shifts of the vector\nmesons can also be in accord with the gradual restoration\nof chiral symmetry if the axial-vector channel exhibits congruently features.\nThe mass resolution of the dilepton spectra of the\nCERES experiment were not high enough to conclusively\ndecide which of the scenarios is realized in nature [15]. The\nhigh precision di-muon data for 158AGeV In-In collisions\nas measured by the NA60 collaboration [20] now provide a\npossibility to put stronger constraints on our understanding of in-medium effects on vector-mesons. Towards this\naim we conduct a comparison of different model calculations with data.\nOur strategy is as follows: Ideally, one would need to\nconstruct an evolution scenario for In-In collisions that is\ndirectly related to hadronic observables in In-In collisions,\nhowever in practice these are not yet sufficiently well determined experimentally. This is why we rely on scaling\narguments to make a sophisticated attempt at describing\nthe evolution of matter in 158AGeV In-In collisions based\non an evolution model for Pb-Pb collisions which has been\nsuccessfully used to describe the plethora of observables\nin Pb-Pb collisions [21].\nUsing this evolution model, we then calculate the resulting dilepton spectra for different scenarios of in-medium\nmodifications of vector mesons and compare with data. We\nare specifically interested in what the NA60 data can tell\nabout dropping mass scenarios and broadening effects.\n\n2 The evolution model\nA detailed description of the evolution model is found in\n[21]. We restrict ourselves to a brief discussion here. The\nscaling from 158 AGeV Pb-Pb to In-In collisions is discussed in more detail in [22,23].\nThe evolution model's main assumption is that an equilibrated system is created at a short time \u03c40 after the onset of the collision. Furthermore, it is assumed that the\nthermal fireball expands isentropically until the mean free\npath of the particles exceeds the dimensions of the systems\n(at a freeze-out time \u03c4f ).\nWe use the following ansatz for the entropy density:\ns(\u03c4, \u03b7s , r) = N R(r, \u03c4 ) * H(\u03b7s , \u03c4 )\n\n(1)\n\nwith \u03c4 the proper time as measured in a frame co-moving\nwith a given volume element and R(r, \u03c4 ), H(\u03b7s , \u03c4 ) two\nfunctions describing the shape of the distribution and N a\nnormalization factor.They are chosen to be Woods-Saxon\n\ndistributions\n\u0015\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0014\nr \u2212 Rc (\u03c4 )\nR(r, \u03c4 ) = 1/ 1 + exp\ndws\n\u0015\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0014\n\u03b7s \u2212 Hc (\u03c4 )\n.\nH(\u03b7s , \u03c4 ) = 1/ 1 + exp\n\u03b7ws\n\n(2)\n\nto describe the shapes for a given \u03c4 .\nThe ingredients of the model are therefore the skin\nthickness parameters dws and \u03b7ws and the parametrizations\nof the expansion of the spatial extensions Rc (\u03c4 ), Hc (\u03c4 ) as a\nfunction of proper time. For a detailed account how those\nare parameterized see [22,23].\nThe parameters of the model have been adjusted to\nhadronic transverse mass spectra, HBT correlation measurements in 158AGeV Pb-Pb and Pb-Au collisions at\nSPS. Since at this point a freeze-out analysis or HBT\ncorrelation data are not available from NA60 we rely on\nscaling arguments.\nThe change in the total entropy production can be\ninferred from the ratio of charged particle rapidity densities dNch /d\u03b7 at 30% peripheral Pb-Au collisions with\n2.1 < \u03b7 < 2.55 measured by CERES [2,3,4] and semicentral In-In collisions at \u03b7 = 3.8 measured by NA60 [20],\nIn\u2212In\nP b\u2212P b\ndNch\n/dNch\n= 0.68.\nThe number of participant baryons and the effective\ninitial radius are obtained with nuclear overlap calculations. We assume that the stopping power scales approximately with the number of binary collision per participant, Nbin /Npart . The shape parameters dws and \u03b7ws\nhave no great impact on electromagnetic emission into the\nmidrapidity slice, they primarily govern the ratio of surface to volume emission of hadrons. Thus, we leave them\nunchanged from their value determined in [21]. Under the\nassumption that the physics leading to equilibration is primarily a function of incident energy we keep the formation\ntime \u03c4 = 1 fm/c as in Pb-Pb collisions. We stress that the\nfinal results exhibit no great sensitivity to the choice of\neither \u03b70 or \u03c40 except in the high M , high pT limit.\nThe largest uncertainty is the choice of the decoupling\ntemperature TF . Due to the smaller system size of InIn, a higher decoupling temperature can be expected. An\nunambiguous answer could be obtained from HBT correlations and the transverse mass spectra, for the time being we tentatively choose TF = 130MeV. This translates\nprimarily into an uncertainty in the normalization of the\nresults. The flow velocity is fixed at TC by choosing the\nvalue of transverse flow obtained at T = 130MeV in the\nPb-Pb model in the same centrality class.\nThere is likewise an uncertainty (which is to some degree correlated with the decoupling temperature) since\nflow determines the slope of hadronic (and to a lesser degree electromagnetic) pT spectra.\nThe equation of state in the hadronic phase and the\noff-equilibrium parameters \u03bc\u03c0 , \u03bcK are inferred from statistical model calculations as described in [21,24]. The resulting fireball evolution is characterized by a peak temperature of about 250 MeV, a lifetime of \u223c 7.5 fm/c and\na top transverse flow velocity of 0.5c at decoupling.\n\n\fJ. Ruppert, T. Renk: What does the \u03c1-meson do? In-medium mass shift scenarios versus hadronic model calculations\n\n3 The hadronic spectral function\nDifferent effective hadronic models and techniques for the\ncalculations of the properties of hadronic matter near and\nbelow the phase boundaries have been suggested. for reviews of the intense theoretical activities, see e.g. [15,16,\n17]. Most of those calculations predict substantial broadening in matter with comparably small shifts of the inmedium masses. However, this might be different if one\nfollows the conjecture by Brown and Rho that in-medium\nvector-meson masses decrease considerably due to the gradual restoration of chiral symmetry and a scaling of the\nmasses with the chiral condensate in the vicinity of the\nphase transition [8,9,10,11]. We therefore discuss this issue separately from hadronic model calculations.\n3.1 Hadronic model calculations\nWe briefly discuss three different hadronic model calculations which predict broadening effects but small mass\nshifts as generic examples. The first model is based on\n[25,26] where the electromagnetic current-current correlator has been computed in the so called improved vector\nmeson dominance model combined with the chiral dynamics of pions and kaons. We refer to this model as 'chiral\nmodel' further on. For the evaluation of finite baryon density effects which are relevant at SPS conditions the results from Klingl, Kaiser, and Weise [27] are used. Thermal broadening of the \u03c1, \u03c6, and \u03c9 were calculated by\nSchneider and Weise as modifications on top of the finite\nbaryon density effects using perturbative methods [26,25].\nIn these calculations it is assumed that the temperature\nand density dependences of the vector meson self-energy\nfactorize. This amounts to neglecting contributions from\npion-nucleon scattering where the pion comes from the\nheat baths. Formally speaking matrix element contributions such as h\u03c0N |T j\u03bc (x)j \u03bc (x)|\u03c0N i are neglected.\nA second approach [28] (referred to as 'Walecka model'\nin the following) is based on a different idea: The method\nof thermofield dynamics is used to calculate the state\nwith minimum thermodynamic potential at finite temperature and density. The temperature and density dependent baryon and sigma masses are calculated selfconsistently. The medium modification to the masses of the \u03c9and \u03c1-mesons in hot nuclear matter including the quantum correction effects are then calculated in the relativistic random phase approximation. The decay widths for\nthe mesons are calculated from the imaginary part of the\nself energy using the Cutkosky rule.\nWe also discuss a third model calculation where we\nsolved truncated Schwinger-Dyson equations incorporating a self-consistent resummation of the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c1 interaction\nin order to determine the thermal broadening of the \u03c1meson, see [29] and especially note [30]. We refer to this\nmodel as the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c1 model. This \u03a6-functional approach\nself-consistently takes into account the finite in-medium\ndamping width of the pion in the thermal heat bath. Effects of baryons are not yet included in the self-consistent\napproximation scheme. The solution of the \u03a6-functional\n\n3\n\napproach includes the full momentum dependence of the\nthree-dimensional longitudinal and transverse components\nof the \u03c1-meson spectral function which is especially important for a comparison with the NA60 data measured\nat integrated and high pT , see [23] section II D.\n3.2 Mass scaling model\nThe universal scaling of the masses of hadronic particles,\nespecially for the \u03c1-meson with the chiral condensate were\nproposed by Brown and Rho [8]. Given this conjecture,\nthe gradual restoration of chiral symmetry would cause\nthe maximum of the spectral function of the \u03c1-meson to\nbe shifted to lower masses in heavy-ion collisions. This\nwould lead to an enhancement of lepton pair production\nat lower invariant masses as compared to the vacuum.\nCalculations in the hidden-local-symmetry model at finite\ntemperature indeed support the notion of dropping masses\n[31,32]. But an explicit calculation of spectral functions in\nsuch an approach, including finite temperature and baryon\ndensity as well as momentum dependence of the spectral\nfunction is not yet available.\nTherefore we take a different approach here and restrict ourselves to the discussion of simplified schematic\nscaling models.\nWe construct a simple mass scaling model which allows\nfor the investigation of a dropping of the \u03c1-mass scaled\nwith the quark condensate and takes in-medium changes\nof the width of the \u03c1-meson in a nuclear medium into\naccount.\nThis model has three main assumptions: i) the relative\nchange of the in-medium mass of the \u03c1-meson is proportional to the relative drop of the quark condensate to some\npower a in the medium:\n\u0013a\n\u0012\nm\u2217\u03c1\nhq q\u0304i\u2217\n,\n(3)\n=\nm\u03c1\nhq q\u0304i\n(ii) the width of the \u03c1-meson can change in the medium,\nand (iii) the validity of vector meson dominance is assumed. For simplicity we assume the rho-meson to be at\nrest and employ a Breit-Wigner parametrization for the \u03c1meson spectral function [33,34] and note that this ansatz\nmay not account for peculiar features, e.g. two separate\npole structures, that could appear in certain classes of\nhadronic models.\nTaking into account the change of the width of the\n\u03c1-meson is necessary since predictions for the in-medium\nmass and in-medium width of the \u03c1-meson in a nuclear\nmedium cannot be independent but have to be strongly\ncorrelated in order to fulfill the QCD sum rule approach\n[34,33].\nFor simplicity we restricted our analysis to QCD sum\nrules at finite baryon density only [34] and did not include\ntemperature effects on the condensate/spectral function.\nAlthough within the (T, \u03bcB ) trajectory probed by the evolution in the In-In system baryon density seems to be\nthe leading influence on the condensate, our model should\nonly be taken as a lower limit of the potential downward\n\n\f4\n\nJ. Ruppert, T. Renk: What does the \u03c1-meson do? In-medium mass shift scenarios versus hadronic model calculations\n\nmass scaling effect, the actual mass shift realized in certain\nspace-time regions of the collision may be stronger.\nIn [34] it was shown that the lower and upper bounds of\nthe in-medium width of the \u03c1-meson at rest that are compatible with the QCD sum rules depend on how rapidly\nthe mass decreases in comparison to the change of the\nquark condensate. The bounds for the in-medium width\nincrease with density if the relative change of the quark\ncondensate is stronger than the relative decrease in mass\n[34].\nAssuming a specific scaling law one can extract the\nupper and lower bounds of the in-medium width of the\n\u03c1-meson at a given density. Those bounds are sensitive to\nthe parameter sets for the QCD sum analysis [34]. Differences between the bounds for different parameter sets\nshow intrinsic uncertainties of the approach. Using these\nboundaries for the in-medium width one can study the\nquestion if the NA60 data are compatible with a specific\nscaling law of the in-medium \u03c1-meson mass.\nTo be specific, we consider here the case a=1/2 in [34]\n(see Fig. 1 therein). We analyzed the upper and lower\nbounds of compatible width in this case for three different\nparameter sets of the QCD sum rule approach [35,27,36].\nThe case a = 1/2 has some resemblance to the Brown-Rho\nscaling law [10,11] if one identifies the parametric mass of\nBrown-Rho scaling with the in-medium \u03c1-meson mass [37,\n38]. This could be a reasonable approximation up to about\nnormal nuclear matter density, \u03c1B = \u03c10 , since the dense\nloop term contribution is expected to be small [37,38]. In\nspite of these obvious similarities between our mass scaling scenario and the Brown-Rho scaling law one should be\ncautious and consider the arguments by Brown and Rho\n[37,38] why an identification of Brown-Rho scaling with\nsimplified mass scaling models is problematic. They propose to address the scaling issue (especially also the identification of parametric and in-medium \u03c1-meson mass) in\nthe framework of the hidden local symmetry with vector\nmanifestation [38,31,32]. Although the issue of a possible\nviolation of vector meson dominance has been stressed recently, this question cannot be expected to be of primarily\nimportance for an understanding of the lineshape of the\nspectra but would effect the overall normalization.\n\n4 Results\nWe first present a comparison with the data using the\nspectral function for the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c1 systems for all pT . The calculation contains a vacuum \u03c1 contribution using a CooperFrye prescription (for details see section II E of [23]). Most\nof the vacuum \u03c1-contribution is generated during the final breakup of the fireball [22,23] and thus the underlying\nflow is strong and shuffles strength to higher pT . This is\nthe reason that the vacuum \u03c1-contribution is almost negligible for the pT < 0.5 GeV spectra, but is important for\nintegrated pT (and high pT > 1GeV). The relative contribution of the vacuum \u03c1 and the in-medium \u03c1 appears\nto be approximately correct. While the strength of the\nvacuum \u03c1 parametrically scales like the freeze-out volume\ntimes the \u03c1-meson's life-time, the in-medium contribution\n\nis sensitive to the lifetime of the fireball. Thus the good\ndescription in the mass region M \u2248 0.6 \u2212 0.9GeV is due to\ncontributions of the vacuum and in-medium \u03c1 and therefore a consistency check of the fireball evolution. We note\nthat the pT > 1GeV spectra are in good agreement with\nthe NA60 data (comparison not shown).\nThe good agreement of the \u03a6-derivable approach calculation with the data including the vacuum \u03c1 is to some\ndegree surprising and unexpected, as the model contains\nthe self-consistent broadening due to the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c1 interaction [29,30] but is completely insensitive to the presence\nof other hadrons, especially baryons (which, based on perturbation theory, are expected to play a major role in the\nbroadening of the \u03c1). One may take this as an indication\nthat the generic shape of the spectral function and its 3momentum dependence is right, not as a proof that this is\nthe main mechanism capable of producing such a spectral\nfunction or that the dynamics of baryons is unimportant.\nHowever, these results clearly indicates that it is necessary to extend studies on non-perturbative mechanisms\nfor broadening in the future.\nThe other model calculations (chiral model, Walecka\nmodel, mass scaling scenarios) rely on the assumption of\na \u03c1-meson at rest relative to the thermal heat bath q =\n0, hence they can only be compared to the data in the\npT < 0.5GeV cut, see [23]. This is somewhat unfortunate\nsince the acceptance of the NA60's experimental setup is\nrelatively small in the M < 0.6 MeV, pT < 0.5GeV region,\nnonetheless interesting conclusions can be drawn.\nThe chiral model and the Walecka model in Fig. 1,\ngive a fair description of the data in the low pT region.\nAlthough we note that the chiral model calculation also\ncontains an in-medium \u03c6 and \u03c9 contribution (as these have\ndifferent mass/width in medium than in vacuum such a\ncontribution would not be removed by the experimental\nsubtraction of the cocktail \u03c6, \u03c9) and apparently the strong\nin-medium \u03c6 broadening is not in good agreement with the\nlow-pT data.\nWe present the results of the calculation with the mass\nscaling scenarios as described in 3.2 in Fig. (2) after acceptance folding and maintaining the normalization for\nthe two different parameter sets P1 [35] and P2 [27] used\nin the QCD sum rule approach [33,34]. Since the spectral function is determined for vanishing three momentum,\nonly comparison with the low pT binned data is meaningful. Given this comparison one realizes that such a \u03c1-mass\nscaling behavior is disfavored in the face of the experimental data. Although part of the observed enhancement\nbelow the mass of the free \u03c1-meson is accounted for, the\nyield in the peak region is underpredicted. As discussed\nabove the vacuum \u03c1-contribution is not strong enough to\naccount for this difference. What also can be stated is that\nscaling scenarios which would predict a dropping mass\nof the \u03c1-meson with the quark condensate that is much\nstronger than in the a = 1/2 case, i.e. a \u226b 1, are in disagreement with the data. This has two reasons, namely, (i)\nthey predict a stronger decrease of the \u03c1-meson mass with\ndensity leading to a stronger shift of the \"peak\" region\ndown to small invariant masses of the di-muon spectra,\n\n\fJ.

They supplemented\nthe in-medium spectral function by thermal broadening\nand obtained qualitatively similar results for mass-scaling\nscenarios, namely somewhat an underprediction of the\nyield in the peak region due to shift to lower masses. We\n\nmention that Greiner and Schenke recently argued that\nnon-equilibrium effects can lead to significant different results in comparison to equilibrium calculations due to the\nimportance of memory effects [40]. They find that this\nmight have significance for the normalization and lineshape of dilepton spectra as obtained in mass scaling scenarios [41].\n\n5 Conclusion\nIn these proceedings we have shown how a dynamical evolution model of 158 AGeV In-In collisions can be constructed in order to calculate the measured di-muon yield\nby applying scaling arguments to an evolution model that\n\n\f6\n\nJ. Ruppert, T. Renk: What does the \u03c1-meson do? In-medium mass shift scenarios versus hadronic model calculations\n\nis able to describe the plethora of observables in Pb-Pb\ncollisions [21].\nFurthermore we discussed how the low-mass NA60 dimuon measurements can be used to disentangle different\nscenarios: strong broadening of the spectral function with\na small shift of the \u03c1-meson mass in medium as inferred\nby hadronic-many body calculations vs. considerable mass\nshift of the \u03c1-meson. We have shown that taking into account only a mass shift without considering changes of the\nin-medium width in a nuclear medium violates QCD sum\nrule constraints [34]. We therefore presented a schematic\nmass scaling model in order to test mass scaling assumptions in a dense medium taking the correlation between\nmass shifts and finite width effects into account. To account for the intrinsic uncertainties we used two different\nparameterization in the QCD sum rule approach. It was\nshown that the evolution model together with hadronic\nmany body calculations which include considerable broadening can account for the data whereas the same evolution\nmodel assuming a mass scaling scenario underpredicts the\nyield in the \"peak\" region of the data and indicates a shift\nof the maximum of the di-muon spectrum down to smaller\ninvariant masses.\nThe NA60 data therefore do not favor downward mass\nscaling and clearly indicate that the dominant in-medium\neffect in the medium created in 158AGeV In-In collisions\nis broadening of the \u03c1-spectral function.\n\n6 Acknowledgment\nWe like to thank Berndt M\u00fcller, Carlos Lourenco, Wolfram Weise and Norbert Kaiser for comments and discussions.

We mention that a discussion has been initiated\nabout how sensitive the non-perturbative broadening effects are to the employed projection methods [44]. We will\naddress these issues in a yet to be published reply.
